mr.
jonathan
shapiro
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court,
i'd
like
to
first
address
some
of
the
factual
issues
that
were
raised
in
petitioner's
argument.
first
of
all,
this
is
a
classic
case
where
the
calling
of
witnesses
would
be,
as
justice
blackmun
suggested,
very
important
to
the
inmate's
defense.
what
had
happened
in
the
prison
on
the
particular
day
in
question
was
that
a
scuffle
had
broken
out
between
an
inmate
and
a
guard.
a
number
of
other
inmates
who
were
in
the
vicinity
came
into
the
room
to
see
what
was
happening,
after
which
they
were
ordered
to
leave.
it
was
at
this
point
that
mr.
real,
while
leaving,
was
stopped,
according
to
his
testimony
at
the
hearing,
was
stopped
by
another
officer
who
shook
him
down
and
delayed
him
from
complying
with
the
order
that
had
been
given
to
him.
the
inmates
which
john
real
requested
be
called
in
his
defense
were
eye
witnesses
who
would
have
corroborated
his
version
of
what
happened,
and
therefore,
in
our
view,
would
have
given
him
a
defense
to
the
charge
that
he
had
disobeyed
an
officer
and
also
the
charges,
in
addition,
that
he
had
incited
to
riot
and
that
he
had
engaged
in
conduct
which
was
disruptive
of
the
orderly
running
of
the
institution.
all
three
of
these
charges
were
made
against
mr.
real,
and
all
three
of
them
were
at
issue
in
the
disciplinary
hearing.
and
the
witnesses
that
mr.
real
requested
be
called
and
which
the
record
below
indicates
were
requested
because
they
had
been
present
and
because
they
would
corroborate
his
version
of
what
happened,
were
the
witnesses
who
were
denied
without
any
explanation
at
any
point
in
either
the
administrative
or
the
judicial
proceedings
of
this
case.
we
think
there
are
two
issues
involved
in
the
case.
mr.
jonathan
shapiro
the
only
witness
who
was
presented
was
the
correction
officer
who
testified
against
him.
mr.
jonathan
shapiro
he
had
requested
that
that
correction
officer
be
present,
because
otherwise
the
correction
officer
would
not
have
been
present.
he
did
not
have
any
witnesses
to
testify
on
his
behalf.
mr.
jonathan
shapiro
he
asked
also
for
the
officer--
mr.
jonathan
shapiro
--those
were
the
witnesses
who
were
denied.
mr.
jonathan
shapiro
the
witness
request
in
this
case
requested
two
inmates
who
were
eye
witnesses,
but
also...
and
an
officer.
and
that
was
all.
mr.
jonathan
shapiro
and
they
were
denied.
mr.
jonathan
shapiro
it
is
clear,
we
think
in
the
record
below,
that
the
request
was
timely
made
to
the
disciplinary
board,
and
that
both
in
the
form
which
the
inmate
was
required
to
fill
out,
he
sufficiently
indicated
the
reasons
for
those
witnesses
to
be
present
by
indicating
they
were
eye
witnesses.
and
he
also,
in
the
court
proceeding
which
followed
the
filing
of
his
petition
for
habeas
corpus,
he
indicated
why
these
witnesses
were
to
be
called
in
his
defense.
in
both
of
these
proceedings,
the
witnesses
were
denied
without
any
explanation.
mr.
jonathan
shapiro
yes.
he
alleged
that
he
had
been
arbitrarily
and
capriciously
denied
due
process
because
witnesses
he
had
requested
were
not
called.
mr.
jonathan
shapiro
mr.
real
was
not
represented
at
any
of
the
judicial
proceedings
below.
he
proceeded
pro
se--
mr.
jonathan
shapiro
--in
the
superior
court,
and
he
also
proceeded
pro
se--
mr.
jonathan
shapiro
--that
argument
was
not
made
at
all
in
the
trial
court,
nor
indeed
was
it
made
by
mr.
real
in
the
supreme
judicial
court.
mr.
jonathan
shapiro
we
think
that
a
fair
reading
of
the
supreme
judicial
court's
opinion
is
that
both
issues
were
considered
and
ruled
on.
mr.
jonathan
shapiro
i
think
that
was
the
issue
presented.
i
think
that
would
have
been
depositive
of
the
petition.
mr.
jonathan
shapiro
yes.
and
i
think
that's
exactly
the
ground
which
the
trial
court
decided.
mr.
jonathan
shapiro
the
state
has
never
given
a
reason.
even
to
this
day,
they
have
never
indicated--
mr.
jonathan
shapiro
--the
trial
judge,
and
this
was
a
superior
court,
state
judge,
held
only
that
because
in
his
view
the
inmate
had
made
a
prima
facie
case,
that
he
was
entitled
to
witnesses,
and
in
court
the
petitioner,
the
state
had
not
given
any
explanation
as
to
why
those
witnesses
were
refused,
he
concluded
that
that
meant
that
the
witnesses
had
been
arbitrarily
denied
and
ordered
relief
on
that
basis.
mr.
jonathan
shapiro
there
was
no
requirement
considered
or
imposed
by
the
trial
judge
that
reasons
be
given
at
the
administrative
rather
than
the
judicial
hearing.
mr.
jonathan
shapiro
i
think
the
supreme
judicial
court
did
certainly
find
that
persuasive.
however,
as
justice
stevens
has
suggested,
i
don't
think
that
the
decision
of
the
supreme
judicial
court
rests
solely
on
that
around.
we
think
that
the
court
considered
both
of
the
issues;
that
is,
whether
in
fact
there
was
an
arbitrary
deprivation
and
secondly,
whether
due
process
requires
that
there
be
some
support
in
the
administrative
record.
and
on
page
22
of
the
petition
for
certiorari,
the
supreme
judicial
court
says,
in
concluding
its
discussion
of
this
issue:
"the
trial
judge
properly
concluded
that
the
sanctions
resulting
from
a
constitutionally
flawed
disciplinary
hearing
were
invalid
and
correctly
ordered
the
return
of
real's
good
time
credits.
"
well,
the
trial
judge
concluded
only
that
the
witnesses
had
been
denied
arbitrarily,
without
any
consideration
or
discussion
of
the
statement
of
reason.
mr.
jonathan
shapiro
i
think,
unquestionably,
that
would
provide,
depending
on
the
facts
of
the
case,
a
legitimate
justification
for
a
limitation
of
the
right
to
call
witnesses.
and
had
the
commonwealth
made
such
a
submission,
i
think
that
it
would
have,
and
i
think
it's
clear
from
the
trial
court's
ruling
that
he
would
have
accepted
that.
the
trial
judge,
as
the
record
of
the
hearing
before
the
trial
judge
indicates,
was
upset
that
the
state
and
the
prison
officials
had
made
no
attempt
whatsoever
to
justify
the
denial
of
witnesses.
he
said
all
they
have
to
do
is
come
in
here
and
tell
us
why
the
witnesses
were
denied,
but
they
didn't
do
so.
and
i
think
it's
that
conclusion
by
the
trial
judge
that,
in
the
face
of
a
showing
by
the
inmate
that
witnesses
had
been
requested,
were
relevant,
that
a
timely
request
had
been
made,
and
that
nothing
else
appeared
on
the
face
of
the
record
to
justify
a
denial
of
those
witnesses,
at
least
in
those
circumstances
the
burden
shifts
to
the
prison
officials
to
come
forward
and
make
some
showing.
this
is
not
to
say
that
the
prison
officials
would
bear
the
burden
of
proof
on
that
issue;
only
that
they
should
come
forward
with
some
explanation
of
why
the
witnesses
were
denied,
at
which
time
the
burden
would
then
remain
with
the
inmate
to
establish
either
that
those
reasons
were
arbitrary
or
not
legitimate.
mr.
jonathan
shapiro
i
think
the
regulations
could
properly
require
such
a
statement.
we
think
in
this
case,
the
inmate
did
make
such
a
showing.
mr.
jonathan
shapiro
the
petitioner
has
never
challenged
the
relevance
of
the
witnesses.
and
we
think
in
this
case,
the
petitioner
made
a
sufficient
showing--
mr.
jonathan
shapiro
--i
think
that
would
be
a
reasonable
requirement.
we
think
in
this
case
it
was
satisfied
by
what
was
in
fact
tendered
by
the
inmate
in
his
request
and
in
the
subsequent
judicial
proceedings.
but
that
hasn't
ever
been
made
an
issue
by
petitioner.
mr.
jonathan
shapiro
that's
correct.
and
the
inmate
himself
did
not
challenge
the
constitutionality
of
the
regulations.
so
we
see
there
are
two
issues
in
the
case;
one,
whether
or
not
due
process
is
violated
by
the
arbitrary
denial
by
the
prison
officials
of
the
witnesses
on
the
facts
of
this
case;
and
the
second
broader
issue,
which
is
the
issue
as
to
whether
due
process
requires
that
the
administrative
record
of
a
disciplinary
hearing
contain
a
basis
for
the
denial
of
witnesses.
and
we
think
they
are
both
separate,
yet
both
presented.
the
second,
broader
one,
we
think
is
unnecessary
to
be
decided
by
this
court,
because
i
think
the
case
can
properly
decided
on--
mr.
jonathan
shapiro
--that
is
one
of
the
bases.
we
think
both
grounds
are--
mr.
jonathan
shapiro
--yes.
and
the
statement
on
page
22,
the
end
of
that
paragraph,
i
think
indicates
that
the
supreme
judicial
court
was
affirming
the
trial
judge's
rationale.
mr.
jonathan
shapiro
and
also
earlier
in
the
opinion,
the
portion
of
the
opinion
referred
to
by
justice
stevens
on
page
16,
where
the
court
in
defining
the
issue
presented,
indicates
that
the
question
is
whether
federal
due
process
requirements
impose
a
duty
on
the
board
to
explain
in
any
fashion
at
the
hearing
or
later,
why
witnesses
were
not
allowed
to
testify.
so
we
think
both
issues
were
properly
presented,
and
at
least
implicitly
properly
considered.
however,
we
think
that
the
respondent
may
defend
the
judgment
below
on
any
ground
that's
properly
presented
by
the
law
and
the
record,
regardless
of
whether
either
of
the
courts
below
considered
both
of
those
issues
specifically.
so
that
even
if
the
supreme
judicial
court's
reasoning
was
based
on
the
broader
issue,
if
that
rationale
is
not
necessary
for
a
decision
of
the
case
by
this
court,
which
we
don't
think
it
is,
it
would
be
unnecessary
for
this
court
to
decide
that
issue.
we
think
that
the
principle
of
judicial
restraint
counsels
in
favor
of
deciding
the
narrower,
rather
than
the
broader
issue.
and
since
the
narrower
issue,
that
is,
the
arbitrariness
of
the
denial
of
the
witnesses
on
the
facts
of
this
case,
was
properly
presented,
provided
the
basis
for
the
decision
by
the
trial
court,
that
that
can
properly
be
the
basis
for
a
decision
by
this
court.
on
that
issue,
furthermore,
we
think
that
the
commonwealth,
in
effect,
concedes
that
judicial
review
is
appropriate
where
the
inmate
has
made
a
prima
facie
case.
judicial
review,
in
a
subsequent
habeas
corpus
proceeding,
at
which
point
when
the
inmate
has
made
that
prima
facie
case,
the
prison
officials
would
have
some
burden
to
justify
the
denial
of
witnesses.
in
this
case,
we
think
that
a
prima
facie
case
was
made,
and
it
is
difficult
to
see
what
more
an
inmate
could
be
required
to
do
than
to
make
a
timely
request
for
relevant
witnesses
who
could
testify
and
in
this
case
provide
a
basis
for
a
self
defense
claim.
the
petitioner's
argument
that
there
is
a
greater
burden
defies
common
sense,
and
it
also
would
make
that
burden
impossible
to
be
met
by
the
inmate.
it's
difficult
to
see
how
the
inmate
could
disprove
the
reasons
that
the
prison
officials
may
have
for
not
calling
a
witness
if
the
inmate
can't
even
find
out
what
those
reasons
are.
the
petitioner
argues
that
somehow
the
inmate
has
a
greater
burden
to
go
beyond
making
a
showing
of
relevance
to
his
or
her
case,
and
to
in
fact
disprove
any
possible
reasons
the
commonwealth
might
have
for
not
calling
the
witnesses.
mr.
jonathan
shapiro
we
think
that
where
the
commonwealth
makes
a
showing
that
that
is
a
consideration
in
the
case,
that
would
be
appropriate.
indeed,
it
would
be
appropriate,
turning
for
a
moment
to
the
question
of
requiring
some
statement
of
reason
or
other
basis
to
appear
in
the
administrative
record
for
a
similar
requirement,
and
we
have
referred
in
our
brief
to
the
regulations
of
the
federal
bureau
of
prisons
which
provides
just
for
such
a
possibility.
and
in
a
case
where
the
disciplinary
board
concludes
that
documenting
the
reliability
of
an
informant
upon
which
it
has
relied
in
a
decision
would
pose
a
threat
to
identifying
that
informant
or
otherwise
endangering
that
informant,
the
disciplinary
board
of
the
chairperson
of
the
disciplinary
board
may
document
those
reasons,
but
not
provide
them
to
the
inmate:
that
is,
to
keep
them
apart
from
the
inmate
for
the
very
purpose
of
a
subsequent
justification
in
court,
at
which
time
the
reasons
could
be
examined
or
the
statement
could
be
examined
in
camera.
so
that
the
only
serious
claim
that
the
commonwealth
has
made
here
that
a
statement
of
reasons
would
interfere
with
security
or
endanger
the
identify
of
an
informant,
there
is
a
perfectly
reasonable
alternative
which
could
be
utilized
so
that
those
reasons
would
not
prejudice
the
particular
informant
involved.
the
other
argument
that
petitioner
makes
to
justify
the
prison
officials
in
not
having
to
make
any
showing,
either
at
the
administrative
hearing
or
otherwise,
is
that
an
inmate's
right
to
present
witnesses
is
not
violated
unless
there
is
a
pattern
or
practice
or
a
discrimination
by
the
disciplinary
board
or
the
prison
officials
which
go
beyond
the
individual
case.
we
think
in
wolff
v.
mcdonnell,
this
court
clearly
stated
that
a
witness
has...
an
inmate
has
a
right
to
call
witnesses
unless
the
witnesses
would
be
irrelevant,
cumulative,
unnecessary,
or
pose
a
threat
to
institutional
security
in
some
other
way.
the
argument
that
somehow
the
inmate
could
be
denied
witnesses
arbitrarily,
so
long
as
there
was
no
overt
discrimination
or
pattern
in
practice,
is
simply
inconsistent
with
wolff,
and
is
unrelated
to
the
reasons
for
according
an
inmate
that
right
to
call
witnesses,
which
is
to
give
that
individual
an
opportunity
to
have
a
fair
hearing
on
the
charges
against
that
particular
inmate.
and
why,
in
order
to
establish
that
that
right
has
been
violated,
that
inmate
would
have
to
show
that
there
is
some
pattern
in
practice,
escapes
me,
and
i
think
finds
no
support
whatsoever
in
any
of
the
cases
this
court
has
decided.
the
commonwealth's
argument
would
also
carry
the
principle
of
deference
to
the
expert
judgment
of
prison
officials
too
far.
what
the
commonwealth,
in
effect,
is
arguing
is
that
the
officials
should
be
presumed
to
have
made
a
decision
to
deny
witnesses
in
accordance
with
applicable
regulations,
and
that
any
inquiry
into
the
basis
for
that
refusal
is
unwarranted.
it's
one
thing
to
defer
where
prison
officials
have
exercised
a
judgment;
it's
another
thing
to
defer
to
the
presumption
that
they
have
exercised
a
judgment
in
accordance
with
applicable
regulations.
and
the
effect
of
the
decisions
of
the
court
below
is
primarily
to
require
that
that
discretion
by
prison
officials,
to
which
this
court
has
often
deferred,
is
in
fact
actually
exercised.
without
some
obligation,
either
in
the
administrative
hearing
or
in
court,
to
justify
their
action,
there
is
in
fact
no
right
to
call
witnesses
on
behalf
of
the
inmate.
and
there
is
no
properly
exercised
discretion
to
which
a
court
could
defer.
so
in
many
ways,
the
requirements
of
the
courts
below
would
serve
the
interests
of
both
the
commonwealth
and
the
inmate
by
insuring
that
the
officials
to
whom
discretion
is
accorded
have,
in
fact,
exercised
it.
once
there
is
that
exercise,
a
court
could
properly,
as
this
court
has
often
counseled,
defer
to
the
discretion
because
of
the
expertise
which
may
have
been
possessed
by
the
officials
who
exercised
it.
we
do
think
that
hughes
v.
roe
is
or
should
be
dispositive
of
the
case,
because
in
hughes
the
inmate
was
held
to
have
made
a
prima
facie
showing
that
he
was
entitled
to
a
hearing.
and
the
prison
officials,
as
in
the
present
case,
made
no
response,
made
no
showing
as
to
any
legitimate
basis
in
administration
for
correctional
goals
for
denying
that
hearing,
and
this
court
said
in
the
absence
of
such
a
showing,
the
inmate
was
entitled
to
relief;
or
at
least
in
that
case,
because
it
involved
a
complaint,
that
the
complaint
should
not
be
dismissed.
the
same
principle
we
think
is
applicable
here
where,
as
we
argue,
the
prima
facie
case
is
made
where
the
prison
officials
in
court
make
no
showing
of
a
legitimate
basis
for
not
according
that
right
of
the
inmate
to
call
witnesses.
then,
that
inmate
should
be
entitled
to
relief.
with
respect
to
the
decision
of
the
court
below
on
the
issue
of
whether
or
not
due
process
requires
that
the
administrative
record
of
a
disciplinary
hearing
have
some
support
for
the
decision
to
deny
witnesses,
i'd
like
to
emphasize
first
that
that
decision
is
not
inconsistent
with
wolff.
in
wolff,
this
court
stated
that
an
inmate
has
a
right
to
call
witnesses,
which
may
be
denied
if
there
are
certain
legitimate
considerations
involved.
the
court
went
on
to
say
that
although
it
would
be
useful
for
the
board
to
give
an
explanation
of
its
reasons
and
make
a
written
statement
of
those
reasons
in
the
record,
at
that
time
the
court
deemed
it
unnecessary
to
require
that.
the
supreme
judicial
court's
decision,
first
of
all,
does
not
require
a
written
statement
of
reason.
what
it
does
require
is
that
there
be
some
support
in
the
administrative
record.
that
requirement
is
a
far
more
flexible
requirement
than
a
written
statement
of
reasons.
that
requirement
can
be
satisfied
by
reviewing
the
record
to
determine
whether
the
record
itself
supports
a
decision
to
deny
witnesses;
for
example,
if
the
request
of
the
inmate
himself
or
herself
indicates
that
the
witnesses
would
not
be
relevant
to
the
proceeding.
for
example,
the
charge
may
be
such
that
it's
clear
that
no
witnesses
could
appropriately
testify
in
the
case.
the
board,
at
a
later
review
in
court,
could
rely
upon
that
information
which
is
obvious
from
a
review
of
the
record
itself
to
deny.
mr.
jonathan
shapiro
i
don't
think
it
would
be
coincidental.
i
think
that
in,
if
not
the
majority
of
the
cases,
many
cases,
reviewing
the
record
of
an
administrative
hearing
will
indicate
what
the
issues
were
in
the
case,
why
the
witnesses
were
called,
and
why
they
were
denied.
so
that
although
there
may
be
cases
where
a
statement
of
reasons
or
some
explanation
by
the
board
is
required,
we
think
that
there
are
many
other
cases
where
the
record
itself
will,
upon
review,
provide
an
adequate
basis
for
a
decision
by
the
board.
mr.
jonathan
shapiro
the
written
record
of
the
hearing
consists
of
the
disciplinary
charge,
and
these
are
set
forth
in
the
appendix
to
this
case,
the
disciplinary
report
which
is
on
page
13-a
of
the
appendix,
the
report
of
the
testimony
and
who
testified
on
14-a,
the
decision
of
the
board
on
15-a,
the
appeal
and
the
decision
of
the
superintendent
affirming
the
conviction
of
the
inmate.
mr.
jonathan
shapiro
there
is
no
transcript.
mr.
jonathan
shapiro
very
often
the
description
of
the
offense
in
the
disciplinary
report
is
more
than
necessary
to
indicate
what
the
case
is
about
and
what
the
evidence
is
likely
to
be.
the
decision
of
the
board
in
which
the
board
sets
forth,
as
this
court
required
in
wolff,
a
statement
of
the
evidence
that's
relied
on,
often
gives
enough
information.
it's
true
that
in
many
cases
it
may
be
coincidental.
in
other
cases
it
may
be
necessary
for
the
board
to
give
a
reason
in
order
to
justify
the
denial
of
witnesses,
particularly
in
those
cases
where
the
basis
upon
which
the
board
is
denying
a
witness,
such
as
institutional
security,
is
the
kind
of
reason
which
is
peculiarly
within
the
knowledge
of
the
board.
mr.
jonathan
shapiro
yes.
that
is
one
of
the
justifications.
mr.
jonathan
shapiro
no.
i
think
that
they
would
be
required
to
set
forth
some
basis
for
that
conclusion.
mr.
jonathan
shapiro
i
think
so.
otherwise,
i
think
it
would
make
meaningless
the
requirement
that
there
be
a
legitimate
justification
if
they--
mr.
jonathan
shapiro
--i
think
that
standard
is
so
broad,
that
effectively
it
would
not
only
insulate--
mr.
jonathan
shapiro
--and
i
think
that
is
because
of
this
court's
decision
in
wolff,
that
a
court
would
be
obligated
to
do
that.
mr.
jonathan
shapiro
i
think
to
the
extent
that
wolff
recognizes
a
right
to
call
witnesses,
that
right,
in
order
to
be
meaningful,
it's
implicit
that
there
has
to
be
at
least
a
limited
judicial
review.
we
suggest
that
a
limited
judicial
review
which
is
appropriate
is
a
review
for
arbitrariness.
mr.
jonathan
shapiro
i
think
it
would
mean--
mr.
jonathan
shapiro
--i
don't
think
that
simply
responding
that
institutional
security
would
be
endangered
does
sufficiently
indicate
that
the
official
knows
what
the
law
is
and
is
applying
it.
that's
the
type
of
phrase
that
is
mouthed
by
prison
officials,
regardless
of
what's
at
stake,
in
order
to
justify
virtually
anything.
