justice
stevens
mr.
levin,
may
i
just
say
that
i'm
still
a
little
unclear
whether
you
draw
a
distinction
between
the
duty
to
explain
at
the
hearing
itself
and
in
subsequent
litigation.
is
it
a
different
duty
or
the
same
duty?
justice
stevens
you're
saying
that
if
aggravated
facts
are
alleged,
you
would
have
to
explain;
if
he
alleged
that
there
was
a
conspiracy
directed
against
him.
but
if
he
merely
alleged
that
this
was
an
eye
witness
who
could
corroborate
his
defense,
that's
not
enough?
justice
stevens
that's
your
position?
and
that's
the
same
position
whether
it's
at
the
hearing
or
whether
he
makes
the
allegation,
an
attack
on
the
hearing
in
a
judicial
proceeding?
justice
stevens
you
draw
no
distinction
between
the
two?
justice
stevens
mr.
levin,
may
i
ask
you
a
question?
you
say
that
they
said
it
had
to
be
done
at
the
hearing.
justice
stevens
but,
in
their
opinion,
they
said
the
question
was
based
on
the
fact
there
was
no...
i
am
reading
from
page
16
of
the
jurisdictional
statement,
i
guess
it
is,
petition
for
certiorari...
failure
to
explain
in
any
fashion
at
the
hearing
or
later.
and
then
again
on
page
21,
there
is
no
explanation
for
the
denial
of
the
inmate
witnesses
requested,
and
so
forth.
i
didn't
find
the
distinction
you
rely
on.
they
said
that
there
was
a
failure
at
both
parts
of
the
proceedings,
is
what
they
were
addressing.
justice
stevens
that
may
all
be
absolutely
correct,
but
the
constitutional
violation,
as
i
understand
their
holding,
was
that
there
was
no
explanation
at
any
time.
and
i
thought
you,
earlier
in
the
proceeding,
said
it
would
be
the
same
issue
whether
you
looked
at
it
later
or
at
the
time
of
the
hearing.
that's
why
i'm
a
little
unsure
of
your
position.
justice
stevens
well,
i
am
still
not
quite
clear
whether
your
position
is
that
there
was
no
constitutional
violation
in
this
record
or
that
the
massachusetts
court
ordered
the
wrong
remedy.
which
do
you
say,
or
both?
justice
stevens
even
though
there
was
no
explanation
at
any
time.
justice
stevens
what
does
that
follow?
because
couldn't
they
put
it
in
the
record,
but
not
show
it
to
the
inmate?
if
it
goes
in
the
record,
does
it
necessarily
have
to...
for
later
review...
does
it
necessarily
have
to
be
disclosed
to
the
inmate?
justice
stevens
i
don't
understand
your
reference
to
wolff.
i
thought
you
said
wolff
doesn't
require
a
statement
of
reasons--
