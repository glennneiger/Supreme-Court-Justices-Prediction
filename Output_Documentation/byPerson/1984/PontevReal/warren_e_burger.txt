we'll
hear
arguments
next
in
ponte
against
real.
mr.
levin,
i
think
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we'll
resume
there
at
1:00
o'clock.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
may
continue,
mr
levin.

mr.
shapiro.
chief
justice
burger
--would
it
have
satisfied
your
position
if
the
reason
given
was
that
it
would
expose
these
witnesses
to
reprisals
either
by
the
individual
or
by
his
friends?
chief
justice
burger
would
it
be
appropriate
for
the
regulations
to
provide
that
in
order
to
have
that
right,
the
inmate
must
tender
or
proffer
a
statement
of
what
the
witnesses,
each
of
the
witnesses
would
say
if
they
were
called?
chief
justice
burger
i'm
not
challenging
that.
chief
justice
burger
the
state
would
hardly
question
the
idea
that
the
inmate
must
identify
and
state
the
testimony
that
would
be
given
if
the
witness
appeared.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
have
anything
further,
mr.
levin?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
