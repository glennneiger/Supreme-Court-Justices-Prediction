justice
marshall
one
thing
that
worries
me:
we
assume
that
the
original
order
by
the
guard
was
a
lawful
order,
don't
we?
do
we
have
to
assume
that?
justice
marshall
yeah.
justice
marshall
for
no
reason?
he
just...
he
doesn't
like
the
way
he
twists
his
moustache,
so
he
said
"you
can't
come
in"?
he
can
do
that?
justice
marshall
and
is
that
a
lawful
order?
justice
marshall
you
say
that
in
this
case,
the
prisoner
has
to
give
all
these
reasons.
well,
doesn't
the
guard
have
to
give
some?
justice
marshall
i
don't
mean
he
had
to
give
reason
to
the
man.
doesn't
he
have
to
give
reasons
to
the
court?
justice
marshall
yeah.
justice
marshall
it
said...
well,
what
was
the
reason
for
the
guard
doing
that?
justice
marshall
that's
in
the
record.
justice
marshall
did
he
have
any
witnesses
at
all?
justice
marshall
i
said
did
he
have
any.
justice
marshall
well,
he
asked
for
two
others.
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
there
any...
can
you
point
to
anyplace
in
the
record
where
the
state
explained
why
it
did
not
permit
him
to
call
these
witnesses?
