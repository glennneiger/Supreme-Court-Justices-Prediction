mr.
theophil
c.
kammholz
mr.
chief
justice
and
members
of
the
court:
at
issue
in
this
case
is
the
extent
to
which
a
state,
by
application
of
state
law,
may
regulate
the
legal
obligations
of
parties
to
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
and
adjudicate
the
legal
consequences
of
the
breach
of
such
agreement.
a
majority
of
the
wisconsin
supreme
court
held
that
section
301
of
the
labor
management
relations
act
of
1947
did
not
preempt
a
state
court
suit
brought
by
a
union
employee
against
his
employer,
alleging
tortious
bad
faith
in
the
administrative
handling
of
a
disability
claim,
even
though
the
employee's
right
to
benefits
derived
entirely
from
a
collective
bargaining
agreement,
and
the
employee
did
not
resort
to
the
contractual
grievance
procedure
which
included
arbitration
at
the
terminal
level.
the
facts
are
simple
and
undisputed.
allis-chalmers
and
the
uaw
union
for
many
years
have
been
parties
to
collective
bargaining
agreements.
the
current
agreement
at
issue
here
incorporates
a
group
health
and
disability
plan
funded
by
allis-chalmers
and
administered
by
aetna
insurance
company.
disability
benefits
are
provided
for
non-occupational
illness
and
injury
to
all
uaw
represented
employees,
including
lueck.
the
agreement
between
the
uaw
and
allis-chalmers
also
contains
a
provision
for
resolution
of
disputes,
as
i
have
noted
earlier.
it's
a
typical
union
contract
dispute
resolution
procedure,
grievance
procedure,
culminating
in
arbitration
at
the
final
level.
lueck
suffered
a
nonwork-related
disability.
payments
were
initiated
under
the
plan.
lueck
ultimately
received
all
that
was
due
him
under
the
plan,
but
there
was
some
delay
in
payment
with
respect
to
some
of
the
obligation
under
the
plan.
lueck
did
not
go
to
his
union.
he
did
not
go
to
the
grievance
procedure.
what
he
did
do
was
to
go
to
the
circuit
court
for
milwaukee
county,
wisconsin
and
file
a
lawsuit
against
allis-chalmers
alleging
contemptuous,
deliberate,
repeated
conduct
on
the
part
of
the
company
in
failing
to
pay...
make
payments
promptly.
he
further
alleged
that
as
as
result
of
the
defendant's
bad
faith,
he
incurred
emotional
distress,
pain
and
suffering,
physical
impairment,
all
to
his
damages
to
the
extent
of
$10,000
compensatory
and
$300,000
punitive.
with
respect
to
the
circuit
court
suit,
allis-chalmers
and
aetna
raised
two
defenses.
first,
that
the
suit
was
preempted
by
section
301
of
the
labor
management
relations
act;
and
secondly,
that
lueck
had
not
resorted
to
the
contractual
grievance
procedure.
mr.
theophil
c.
kammholz
yes,
justice--
mr.
theophil
c.
kammholz
--the
record
does
not
show
this.
it
may
well
be.
the
reason
i
say
the
record
does
not
show
it,
the
case
went
up
on
summary
judgment.
and
i
was
about
to
come
to
that
motion
for
summary
judgment
on
the
failure
to
exhaust
the
grievance
procedure
and
on
account
of
preemption
under
301.
the
circuit
court
granted
motion
for
summary
judgment
on
behalf
of
both
defendants
allis-chalmers
and
aetna.
an
appeal
was
taken
to
the
wisconsin
court
of
appeals.
it
affirmed
the
lower
court
decision.
and
further
appealed
to
the
wisconsin
supreme
court
with
respect
to
certiorari,
to
wit
we're
here
today.
a
majority
of
that
court
in
january
of
last
year,
relying
on
what
it
said
were
long-established
principles
of
state
insurance
law,
held
that
any
violation
of
the
labor
agreement
was
irrelevant
to
the
issue
of
bad
faith
handling
of
the
disability
claim.
further,
the
court
said
there
was
no
301
presumption
"even
though
the
insurance
contract
is
part
of
a
labor
agreement
otherwise
governed
by
federal
law.
"
by
implication,
the
court
further
held
that
there
was
no
need
to
resort
to
the
grievance
procedure
because
it
did
not
comment
on
the
grievance
procedure.
the
single
dissent
in
the
wisconsin
supreme
court
concluded
that
any
duty
allegedly
violated
by
allis-chalmers
was
specifically
created
by
the
labor
contract
and
would
not
exist
absent
the
labor
contract.
consequently,
the
dissent
concluded,
it
must
fail
within...
on
account
of
the
ambit
of
section
301
which
governs
labor
agreements.
the
dissent
further
noted
that
there
should
have
been
an
exhaustion
of
remedies
under
the
grievance
procedure
which
did
not
occur.
finally,
the
dissent
concluded
that
the
mere
existence
of
a
state
tort
of
bad
faith
is
insufficient
to
override
uniformity
in
application
of
federal
labor
law,
and
to
do
as
the
majority
holds
fragments
federal
labor
law.
i
have
gone
into
some
detail
here
on
what
happened
in
the
court
below
because
i
think
that
puts
into
sharp
focus
precisely
the
issues
before
you
here
this
afternoon.
we
respectfully
submit
that
this
is
a
301
case,
pure
and
simple...
a
labor
agreement,
grievance
procedure,
arbitration
at
the
terminal
level,
no
attempt
to
grieve.
since
the
enactment
of
lmba
in
1947
and
beginning
with
the
first
significant
decision
in
that
area
in
1957,
the
lincoln
mills
case,
and
continuing
through
the
steelworkers
trilogy
in
1950,
boys
market
in
1957,
i
believe,
the
law
has
consistently
held
that
it's
federal
law
that
must
be
fashioned
by
the
courts,
federal
law
and
not
state
law.
and
yet,
the
result
of
the
supreme
court
decision
of
wisconsin
here
would
fragment
that
federal
law
and
permit
encroachment
on
the
exclusivity
that
is
created
under
lmba
and
under
the
decided
cases.
with
respect
to
the
preemption
aspect,
we
suggest
also
that
the
law
is
crystal
clear.
in
lucas
flower
in
1962
the
court
first
articulated
the
concept
of
preemption
of
state
law.
this
has
been
applied
consistently
and
without
exception
over
the
years.
the
erosion
that
would
result
from
acceptance
of
the
wisconsin
doctrine
would
be...
would
have
very
serious
implications
on
the
federal
labor
scene.
in
that
respect
i
think
it
is
appropriate
for
me
to
note
the
cogent
amicus
brief
filed
by
the
afl-cio
and
a
similar
brief
by
the
united
states
chamber
of
commerce.
these
briefs
state
in
some
detail
their
view
as
to
what
would
result
if
state
action
could
be
accorded
the
kind
of
finality
that
would
apply
under
the
wisconsin
decision.
the
issue
is
simple:
does
wisconsin
as
a
state
have
the
right
to
impose
insurance
principles
in
the
context
of
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
governed
by
federal
law
with
arbitration
in
the
grievance
procedure
also
included
in
that
contract,
and
which--
mr.
theophil
c.
kammholz
--linn
was
a
libel
action.
your
honor,
linn
was
not
a
contract
301
case.
linn
was
a
section
7
and
8
nlra
breach.
mr.
theophil
c.
kammholz
yes,
sir.
mr.
theophil
c.
kammholz
yes.
and
it
applies
whether
the
action
is
brought
in
state
court
or
whether
it's
brought
in
federal
court.
the
wisconsin
supreme
court--
mr.
theophil
c.
kammholz
--it
was
not.
mr.
theophil
c.
kammholz
there
are
other
cases
involving
egregious
conduct,
none
in
the
context
of
a
collective
bargaining
agreement;
all
in
the
context
of
does
the
national
labor
relations
act
preempt;
what
is
the
reach
of
the
nlra.
mr.
theophil
c.
kammholz
yes.
the
wisconsin
supreme
court
should
have
said,
very
simply,
this
case
is
preempted,
period.
mr.
theophil
c.
kammholz
yes.
in
the
dowd
case
in
this
court
the
law
was
articulated
along
these
lines,
that
yes,
the
state
court
may
adjudicate,
but
a
state
court
must
apply
federal
law.
mr.
theophil
c.
kammholz
yes.
the
wisconsin
court
did
confuse
the
preemption
doctrine
under
301
with
the
preemption
doctrine
under
nlra,
sections
7
and
8.
we
assert
that
the
70...
that
the
301
doctrine
is
the
only
doctrine
applicable
here;
that
section
7
and
8
doesn't
come
into
play
because
we're
dealing
with
a
collective
bargaining
agreement,
a
grievance
procedure
and
arbitration.
mr.
theophil
c.
kammholz
absolutely,
no
question
about
that.
unless
the
court
has
further
questions,
at
this
time
i
should
like
to
reserve
for--
mr.
theophil
c.
kammholz
--yes.
mr.
theophil
c.
kammholz
the
record
is
barren,
of
course,
with
respect
to
erisa.
mr.
theophil
c.
kammholz
both
federal
laws.
mr.
theophil
c.
kammholz
that's
why
we're
here
in
tandem,
i
assume.
yes.
i...
with
respect
to
your
question,
i
believe
that
there
may
well
be
another
discrete
route
for
preemption.
we
now
have
two
and
possibly...
and
three,
i
suppose...
301,
nlra,
and
erisa.
so
a
parallel,
yes.
i
do
not
think
that
this
could
conflict
with--
mr.
theophil
c.
kammholz
--in
any
event
it's
federal,
yes.
mr.
theophil
c.
kammholz
thank
you.
mr.
theophil
c.
kammholz
your
honors,
if
you
have
no
questions.
mr.
theophil
c.
kammholz
yes,
your
honor.
