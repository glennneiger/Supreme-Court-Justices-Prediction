justice
jr.
well,
mr.
kammholz,
i
gather
the
court,
in
linn
at
least,
recognized
that
there
might
be
state
law
action,
notwithstanding
a
breach
of...
that
was
a
libel
action,
wasn't
it?
justice
jr.
well,
when
you
say
preemption,
i
gather
what
you
mean
is
that
it's
a
breach
of
contract.
the
action
must
be
under
301
whether
that
action
is
brought
in
the
state
court
or
the
federal
court.
justice
jr.
and
it's
not
really
preemption.
it's
state
law...
rather,
federal
law,
and
only
federal
law
applies
if
it's
an
action
for
breach
of
the
collective
bargaining.
justice
jr.
well,
it
then
was
not
a
breach
of
collective
bargaining?
justice
jr.
didn't
we
have
another?
i
thought
we
had
some
other
that...
well,
i've
forgotten.
justice
jr.
well,
i
gather,
mr.
kammholz,
what
you
would
have
hoped
the
wisconsin
court
would
say
is
we'll
treat
this
as
a
301
suit
brought
in
state
court;
we'll
stay
it
while
we
send
you
to,
under
boys
market,
to
exhaust
your
administrative
remedies
and
end
up
in
arbitration.
that's
what
you
wanted,
wasn't
it?
justice
jr.
well,
i
gather,
though,
mr.
boisits,
what
you're
saying
is
even
though
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
says
for
issues
of
this
kind
you
must
go
through
the
grievance
procedure,
you
must
accept
arbitration,
it
doesn't
really
mean
anything,
because
if
the
state
wants
to
intervene
and
say
well,
we've
got
a
different
policy
in
particular
respects,
and
if
that
policy
is
violated,
then
that's
in
addition
to
whatever
remedy
you
have
under
the
collective
bargaining.
that
is
what
you're
saying?
justice
jr.
i
know,
but
it's...
it's
adding
something.
i
thought
you
just
suggested
to
justice
white
that
there
isn't
any
question
in
terms
at
least
that
the
arbitration
and
grievance
procedure
applied
to
this
claim;
isn't
that
right?
justice
jr.
well,
i
was
looking
at
the
conclusion
of
the
agreement.
i
wasn't
looking--

jr.

appendix,

24.
justice
jr.
twenty-four,
yes.
see
that
paragraph,
the
first
paragraph
at
the
top
of
the
page,
240?
it's
a
rather
broad
authority.
justice
jr.
well,
doesn't...
doesn't
the...
under
that
provision
would
not
the
arbitrator
decide
whether
a
given
grievance
comes
within
his
authority
or
not?
justice
jr.
whether
it's
an
arbitrable
grievance.
wouldn't
that
be
within
his
authority
to
decide?
justice
jr.
well,
now,
look
at
this
letter
at
page
43
that
you
refer
to
expressly
says
that
"question
within
the
committee's
scope
shall
be
referred
to
it
and
shall
not
be
processed
in
the
first
three
steps
of
the
grievance
procedure,
but
may
be
presented
for
arbitration
in
the
established
manner
once
they've
been
discussed
and
have
not
been
resolved.
"
justice
jr.
i
don't
see
any
independent.
that
seems
to
me
to
reach
your...
that's
your
arbitration--
