mr.
gerald
s.
boisits
mr.
chief
justice,
members
of
the
court:
before
proceeding
into
my
response
to
mr.
kammholz's
argument,
i'd
like
to
clarify
a
few
of
the
facts
that
i
believe
are
part
of
the
record.
first
of
all,
while
mr.
kammholz
does
admit
to
the
fact
that
these
disability
benefits
on
behalf
of
mr.
lueck
were
eventually
received,
the
record
should
show
that
mr.
lueck
received
these
benefits
only
after
allis-chalmers
and
aetna
insurance
company
were
served
with
his
cause
of
action.
mr.
gerald
s.
boisits
excuse
me,
your
honor.
mr.
gerald
s.
boisits
your
honor,
yes
and
no,
all
right.
first
of
all,
as
far
as
the
union
contract
is
concerned,
we've
got
a
contract
that
on
one
hand
provides
for
the
normal
things
that
a
labor
contract
provides
for...
labor,
conditions
of
employment,
wages,
that
type
of
thing.
then
we
have
a
peripheral
thing
where
the
insurance
or
the
employer
has,
in
addition,
provided
some
health
benefits
and--
mr.
gerald
s.
boisits
--it
did
come
from
the
agreement.
it's
specifically
mentioned
in
the
union
contract.
it
was
something
that
was
negotiated.
i
can't
argue
with
that.
the
problem
i
have
in
looking
at
the
case
is
primarily
the
situation
where
they've
accepted
the
obligations
to
insure
mr.
lueck
under
a
disability
policy,
and
they've
therefore
basically
put
on
the
hat
of
an
insurance
company
and
are
now
attempting
by
virtue
of
section
301
to
avoid
some
of
the
obligations
that
the
state
recognizes
as
mandatory
as
far
as
someone
that's
acting
as
an
insurance
company.
and
in
that
situation,
mr.
lueck
is
really
caught
between
a
rock
and
a
hard
place
basically,
because
he
can
go
through
the
union
procedures,
and
what's
basically
provided
under
those
union
procedures
is
that
he's
going
to
collect
whatever
disability
benefits
he's
entitled
to
if
they
were
denied,
and
perhaps
maybe
some
interest
that
he
lost...
that's
not
clear
by
the
contract...
and
that's
it.
the
insuring
employer
can
therefore
basically
be
entitled
to
a
free
play
with
his
insurance
benefits.
mr.
gerald
s.
boisits
true.
but
a
state--
mr.
gerald
s.
boisits
--yes,
but
basically
as
far
as
an...
when
the
employer
acts
as
an
insurer,
there
are
other
obligations
that
the
state
feels
that
are
very
important.
and
in
this
case
we
are
proceeding
against...
against
the
employer--
mr.
gerald
s.
boisits
--i'm
saying
that
it--
mr.
gerald
s.
boisits
--that
i'm
saying...
no,
i'm
not,
your
honor.
basically--
mr.
gerald
s.
boisits
--he
can
go
to
arbitration
to
get
his
contract
benefits,
the
benefits
that
are
arising
out
of
the
breach
of
the
contract,
the
employment
contract.
they
provide
for
him
to
get
a
means
of
redress.
he
can
get
his--
mr.
gerald
s.
boisits
--as
far
as
disability
benefits
are
concerned,
but
the
state
interest,
the
interest
that
the
wisconsin...
that
the
state
of
wisconsin,
as
well
as
the
wisconsin
majority,
indicated
was
look
at,
we
cannot
allow
an
employer
to
hide
under
a
section
301
case,
or
what's
claimed
to
be
a
section
301
case.
they
can
horse
mr.
lueck
around
forever.
they
can
delay
his
payments.
he
can
go
through...
he
can
go
through
the
arbitration
process.
they
can
pay
his
disability.
then
later
on
they
can
deny
him
payments
again.
they
can
send
him
to
four
or
five
different
doctors,
all
of
whom
affirm
his
disability,
and
still
deny
it
and
then
go
through
the
arbitration,
and
so
forth
and
so
on
without
any...
without
any...
with
impunity.
mr.
gerald
s.
boisits
and
wreck
the
entire
employment
contract
by
allowing--
mr.
gerald
s.
boisits
--your
honor,
i
can't--
mr.
gerald
s.
boisits
--yes,
but
now
we're
getting
into--
mr.
gerald
s.
boisits
--yes.
the
state
could
not
say
that.
mr.
gerald
s.
boisits
basically
because
now
that's
dealing...
that's
stepping
right
into
a
situation
of
the
conditions
of
employment
and
wages,
something
that
section
301--
mr.
gerald
s.
boisits
--something
that's
related
to
the
contract,
yes.
mr.
gerald
s.
boisits
well,
the
policy...
what
i'm
saying,
though,
is
that--
mr.
gerald
s.
boisits
--i'm
sorry.
i
don't
understand
the
question.
mr.
gerald
s.
boisits
yes,
it
is.
mr.
gerald
s.
boisits
no,
it
doesn't.
mr.
gerald
s.
boisits
it
says
the
contrary.
but
again,
where
does...
we're
talking
about
a
state
interest
here
in
making
sure--
mr.
gerald
s.
boisits
--why
can
the
state
do
it?
mr.
gerald
s.
boisits
the
state
can
step
in
and
allow
mr.
lueck
compensatory
damages
and
punitive
damages
just
like
was
discussed
in
the
previous
case.
they
cannot
rule
as
to
the
eligibility
as
far
as
disability
benefits
are
concerned.
that's
something
that
the
parties
to
the
labor
agreement
anticipated,
and
that's
something
that
they've
agreed
to
go
through
arbitration
process
on.
but
they
have
not...
there
is
nothing
in
that
contract
to
indicate
what...
if
there
are
any
procedures
in
respect
to
how
the
employer,
who
is
an
insurer...
i
think
the
key
thing
here
as
far
as
the
court
should
consider
is
that
the...
that
the
employer
now
has
stepped
out
of
the
shoes
of
an
employer
and
has
taken
on
the
guise
of
an
insurance
company;
and
as
a
result,
they
become
amenable
to
some
of
the
equitable
principles.
mr.
gerald
s.
boisits
no,
i'm
not.
because
i'm
saying,
what
i'm
saying
is
that
the
wisconsin
supreme
court
decision
is
accommodating
to
the
section
301
arguments.
congress
as...
as--
mr.
gerald
s.
boisits
--it
applies
to
a
claim
for
disability
benefits.
it
does
not
apply
to
a
claim
for
bad
faith,
the
bad
faith
tort
that
wisconsin
has
promulgated.
it
only
applies
to
the
collection
of
his
disability
benefits.
if
they
deny
him
his
benefits,
he
can
go
through
an
arbitration
process,
if
they
wrongfully,
recklessly,
contemptuously
deny
his
benefits.
mr.
gerald
s.
boisits
that's
what
i'm
saying.
mr.
gerald
s.
boisits
you're
talking
a
renegotiation
of
the
contract
then.
mr.
gerald
s.
boisits
there's
no...
there's
no
provisions
in
there
for
that
now.
where
is
the...
where
is
the
employer
amenable
to
the
situation
that
mr.
lueck
faced,
if
they're
treating
him
in
bad
faith
as
alleged?
where
is
he
amenable
to
it?
he
can
do
that
with
every
employer
until
the
union
steps
forward
and
says
let's
negotiate.
hey,
you're...
you
know,
you're
horsing
the
people
around.
mr.
gerald
s.
boisits
just
the
disability,
not...
wisconsin
looked
at
this
as
a
separate
tort
action,
just
like
it
looked...
this
court
has
looked
at
as
emotional
distress,
intentional
causing
emotional
distress,
malicious
libel...
those
type
of
cases.
this
court
has
looked
at
those
things
and
has
designed
a
policy
to
show
that
yes,
you
can
go
into
court...
if
the
action
is
of
a
particularly
contemptuous
nature,
you
can
go
into
court
and
sue
on
that.
there
won't
be
any
infringement
on
it.
it
was
said
in
farmer.
it
was
said
in
other
cases,
which
admittedly
do
deal
with
the
garman
exceptions
or
the
garman
preemption
doctrine
and
the
related
cases.
however,
i
think
that
it's
important
to
note
that
the
first
criteria
under
the
garman
ruling
is
basically,
one,
number
one,
that
the
court
has
got
to
see
whether
or
not
there's
any
conflict
with
section
301,
with
the
labor
management
relations
act.
that's
the
first
criteria
that's
stated
in
the
garman
case.
mr.
gerald
s.
boisits
as
far
as
the
disability
benefits
are
concerned?
i
would
consider
that
a
debt,
a
debt
under
the
contract.
mr.
gerald
s.
boisits
no,
he
isn't.
mr.
gerald
s.
boisits
there's
got
to
be
a
particularly
abusive
manner
in
failing
to
do
it,
other
ulterior
motives.
mr.
gerald
s.
boisits
it's
a
breach
of
contract.
there's
no...
there's
no
malice.
there's
no
particularly
abusive
manner
where
brooks
brothers
has
been
harmed
by
it.
they're
not
going
to
be
harmed
by
it.
you
know,
the
cost
of
your
suit
is
not
going
to
be
there.
pardon?
mr.
gerald
s.
boisits
they
haven't
gotten
their
money,
but
they
have
not
been
harmed
by
the
action
that
you've
done
except
they
haven't
gotten
their
money.
mr.
gerald
s.
boisits
yes,
they
are.
mr.
gerald
s.
boisits
we're
talking...
we're
talking
an
employer,
a
giant
industry.
we're
talking
an
employer-insurer
who
is...
who
is
out
to
horse
somebody
around,
to
keep
them
horsing
around,
and
he's
continually
being
denied
the
benefits.
where
can
mr.
lueck
turn?
the
state
is
the
only
place
he
can
go.
the
union,
as
indicated
here,
both
the
union
and
the
united
states
chamber
of
commerce
are
amicus
here.
there's
nowhere
to
turn
except
to
the
state,
the
state
that's
promulgated
state--
mr.
gerald
s.
boisits
--mr.
lueck
received
his
benefits
before
there
was
any
right--
mr.
gerald
s.
boisits
--well,
the
union
didn't
refuse
to
do
anything
in
this
case.
mr.
gerald
s.
boisits
but
what
i'm
saying
is
is
that--
mr.
gerald
s.
boisits
--no,
i
can't.
mr.
gerald
s.
boisits
justice,
i'm
not
trying.
i'm
just
saying,
though,
that
the
way
the
forces
are
on
this
course
that
there's
danger
on...
as
far
as
contracts
are
concerned,
that
individuals
cannot
have
any
redress
if
someone
on
a
labor
contract
horses
them
around,
unless
that
contract
is
renegotiated
and
re-evaluated
by
the
parties.
and
what
if
it
isn't?
both
parties
have
interest
not
to
have
a
bad
faith
claim
brought
against
them.
they
don't
want
to
have
to
deal
with
that.
mr.
gerald
s.
boisits
i
think
that's
why
they're
there.
i
don't
think
they're
looking
at
this
as
an
infringement.
this
is
a...
this
is
a
type
of
case
where...
that
they
can
become
amenable
to
this
type
of
action.
it's
a
separate,
distinct
tort
that
the
court
has
looked
at,
and
they've
treated
it
basically--
mr.
gerald
s.
boisits
--yes.
because
then
the
state
interest
has
been
recognized,
the
interest
that
the...
the
contract
is
now
taking
into
account.
mr.
gerald
s.
boisits
justice,
it
is
conceivable,
but
unfortunately,
it
wasn't
done
in
this
case,
or
fortunately.
mr.
gerald
s.
boisits
your
honor,
in
addition
to
that
there's
the
other
letter
that
specifically
just
says
that--
mr.
gerald
s.
boisits
--are
we
looking
in
the...
what's--
mr.
gerald
s.
boisits
--on
page
24?
mr.
gerald
s.
boisits
yes,
your
honor,
but
again,
as
far
as
this
would...
this
page
is
concerned
and
this
paragraph
is
concerned,
i
would
argue
that
this
applies
to
anything
dealing
with
wages
and
conditions
of
employment.
if
we
have
to...
i
think
the--
mr.
gerald
s.
boisits
--as
far
as...
whether
they
decide...
whether...
well,
i'd
say--
mr.
gerald
s.
boisits
--well,
i'd
say
as
far
as
mr.
lueck
was
concerned,
if
he
looked
at
the
thing
and
he
determined
that
this
is
a
wage-related
or
he
felt
it
was
a
wage-related
condition
of
employment
situation,
yes,
he
would
go
to
the
arbitrator.
however,
he
could
be
misled
because
of
the
statements
that
are
in
the
joint
appendix
on
page
42
and
43.
when
looking
at
this,
it
was
my
feeling
and,
of
course,
mr.
lueck's
as
a
result,
that
the
statements
that
the...
the...
are
in
that
letter
are
supplementing
the
labor
agreement.
they're
treating
it
as
a
separate
thing.
they're
treating
the
insurance
benefits
as
a
separate
thing,
and
there
they're
just
referring
to
the
discontinuance
of
weekly
disability
payments.
mr.
gerald
s.
boisits
didn't
consider
what
at
all?
mr.
gerald
s.
boisits
i
was
asked
about
it
at
an
oral
argument.
they
did
not
put
that
down
as
far
as
their
decision
was
concerned.
mr.
gerald
s.
boisits
no,
it
isn't.
what
they're
looking
at
is
they're
looking...
i
believe
that
they're
promulgating
the
state
interest.
they're
saying
lueck
has
nowhere
else
to
go
for
this;
that
our
state...
we've
designed
statutes,
we've
designed
case
law
that
treats
this
bad
faith
treatment
as
a
separate,
distinguishable
tort
from
the
contract,
and
as
a
result,
we
are
ruling
that
there
is
jurisdiction
to
proceed
against
the
employer
when
he
puts
the
hat
on
as
an
insurer.
mr.
gerald
s.
boisits
i
look--
mr.
gerald
s.
boisits
--but
they're
making
the
final
decision
as
to
whether
or
not
we're
going
to
refer
it
back
to
the
labor
agreement,
justice.
and,
in
addition...
well,
42,
page
42,
that
letter
again
shows
that
it
only
deals
with
disability
benefits
and
nothing
else.
so,
again,
we
would
be
consistent
with
what
they're
saying
here,
that
we'd
be
going
through
the
labor
agreement
in
respect
to
discontinuance
of
weekly
disability
benefits,
and
that's
it.
if
i
may
make
a
suggestion
to
the
court,
i
think
the
court,
at
least
as
far
as
the
philosophy
is
concerned,
has
addressed
this
question
in
respect
to
the
garman
preemption
situation.
a
short
note:
the
garman
preemption
arguments
as
presented
by
myself
were
originally
brought
up
in
the
circuit
court
and
determined
by
justice
lamponi
in
the
circuit
court
on
the
two
grounds:
one,
section
301
preemption;
and
number
two,
on
the
basis
of
garman.
that
argument
was
brought
all
the
way
through
the
wisconsin
courts,
and
that's
why
the
wisconsin
court
relied
heavily
on
the
garman
argument,
primarily
because
it
was
raised
by
opposing
counsel
and
allis-chalmers.
i'd
like
to
bring
out
just
two
points
as
far
as
the
garman
preemptions
considerations
are.
the
court
did
appear
hard-pressed
when
they
talked
about,
say,
emotional
distress
in
the
farmer
decision.
in
other
words,
it
appeared
to
me
as
reading
the
decision
that
the
court
wanted
to
make
perfectly
clear
that
as
far
as
the
emotional
distress
situation
is
concerned,
that
that
would
have
to
be
something
completely
separate
out
of
this
wage
and
conditions
of
employment
argument.
that
the...
the...
we
have
to...
we
have
to
look
at
the
type
of
conduct
that
was
promulgated
by
the
tort
feasor.
in
other
words,
in
that
case
it
was
my
understanding
that
the
emotional
distress
was
a
function
of
the
particularly
abusive
manner
in
which
the
claimant
was
handled
by
the
union
officials,
and
that
the
matters
dealing
with
the
negotiation
of
the
contract
or
the
rates
under
the
contract
were
completely
separate.
and
you
can
see,
at
least
from
my
reading
of
it,
it
seems
that
this
court
has
attempted
to
distinguish
that.
that's
basically
all
that
mr.
lueck
is
doing.
he's
attempting
to
show
that
there
was
a
particularly
abusive
manner
in
which
he
was
treated
that's
separate
and
distinct
from
the
labor
contract,
and
that
yes,
he
can
go
through
the
remedies
that
are
afforded
by
the
labor
contract,
and
yes,
he
can
go
into
state
court
and
go
after
that
separate
tort
and
the
remedies
that
are
available
there.
the
dual
functions
are
served.
the
section
301
is
remaining
intact,
and
the
state
interest
in
making
sure
that
insurance
companies
don't
horse
an
individual
around
are
also
remain
intact.
they
can
go
hand
in
hand.
they
do
not
necessarily
butt
heads.
another
argument
as
far
as
the
garman
philosophy
is
concerned
is
that
the
section
301
preemption
argument
is
incorporated
in
the
garman
exceptions.
number
one,
the
number
one
criteria
where
it
talks
of
whether
or
not
the
action
is
one
of
peripheral
concern
to
the
labor
management
relations
act,
that
directly
goes
to
section
301
considerations,
whether
or
not
section
301
applies.
the
wisconsin
court
saw
the
tort
as
separate
and
distinct
and
that
it
did
not
infringe
on
the
section
301
rights.
and
as
a
result,
he's
able
to
bring
that
state
court
action.
and
again,
the
whole
situation,
it
accommodates,
it
accommodates.
mr.
lueck's
action
accommodates
both
the
state
interest
and
the
federal
interest
under
301.
the
decision
of
the
wisconsin
supreme
court
noted
that.
they
paid
due
deference
to
the
decisions
of
this
court.
they're
just
saying
that
he's
proceeding
on
a
different...
he's
proceeding
on
a
different
track.
he's
trying
to
get
some
recovery
and
redress,
something
that
you're
entitled
to.
he's
trying
to
get
the
redress
for...
for
the
abusive
manner
he
was
treated
in.
now,
i
know
that
the
erisa
argument
as
posed
by
justice
day
is
going
to
probably
depend
on
how
the
decisions
come
out
on
the
case
that
was
previous
to
this
one.
however,
i'd
like
to
note
again
that
there
is
a
federal
policy,
at
least
as
we
stand
now,
that
the
federal
policy
that's
put
in
the
mccarran-ferguson
act
clearly
shows
that
there
should
be
no
preemption
here
of
the
state
right
to
regulate
the
insurance
activities.
the
situation
that
we
have
here
is
pretty
much
like
what
happened...
the
provisions
in
the
labor
agreement,
as
far
as
the
insurance
benefits
are
concerned,
the
insurance
portion
of
the
brief,
of
the
contract,
indicates
that
allis-chalmers
had
a
choice
of
whether
or
not
to
self-insure
or
whether
or
not
to
hire
somebody,
an
insurance
company,
to
insure
them
and
that
type
of
thing.
now,
the
question
i'd
pose
to
the
court
is
what
would
happen
if
allis-chalmers
in
this
case
allowed
another
insurance
company
to
insure
the
disability
plan;
rather
than
allis-chalmers
being
self-insured,
they
hired
another
company,
and
they
paid
premiums
to
that
company
for
those
benefits.
if
the
argument
of
opposing
counsel
remains
consistent,
apparently
that
insurance
company
can
claim
the
exemption
for
the
same
reason
that
they're
claiming
it
now;
that
they
are
not
amenable
to
any
state
regulation;
that
it's
a
section
301
situation;
and
that
if
the
insurance
company
doesn't
pay,
we'll
go
through
the
arbitration
process
and
determine
whether
or
not
they
have
an
obligation
to
pay
in
this
case.
they
have
now...
the
insurance
company
has
now
been
able
to
avoid
any
liability
by
attaching
itself
to
allis-chalmers.
in
big
letters
in
my
argument
i
basically
would
like
to
show
the
court
is
a
distinguishing
case
as
far
as
section
301
is
concerned.
the
employer
has
changed
hats.
they
are
providing
for
insurance
benefits.
they've
taken
a
self-insured
position,
and
now
they're
claiming
an
immunity
because
of
that
self-insured
position.
and
in
addition
to
that,
i
guess
that
immunity
would
go
to
anybody
they'd
hire,
because
the
labor
agreement
provides
for
that
type
of
benefit,
and
therefore,
anybody
they
hire
or
anybody
that
does
anything
in
respect
to
that
insurance
is
going
to
be
immune
from
the
type
of
action
that
mr.
lueck
has
brought.
he
has
nowhere
to
go,
and
to
not
allow
him
to
go
anywhere
i
think
steps
on
a
state
decision,
a
majority
decision,
that
can
accommodate
the
vague
statements
as
far
as
section
301
is
concerned.
it's
for
actions
arising
out
of
contract.
wisconsin
says
it
has...
this
does
not
arise
out
of
the
contract.
it's
a
separate
and
distinct
tort.
and
therefore,
it's
my
opinion...
and
i--
mr.
gerald
s.
boisits
--excuse
me?
mr.
gerald
s.
boisits
my
complaint
does
not
say
that,
your
honor.
mr.
gerald
s.
boisits
my
complaint
is
saying
that
one
of
the
elements--
mr.
gerald
s.
boisits
--well,
it
mentions
contracts,
your
honor,
but
i
am
not
going--
mr.
gerald
s.
boisits
--but
i'm
going
for
something
that
does
not...
that
the
contract
does
not
provide
for.
the
contract
provides
for
payment
of
disability
benefits.
that's
it.
i'm
going
for
a
tortious
action
where
again
if
the
insurance
company
continued
to
sporadically
make
payments,
mr.
lueck
wouldn't
be
able
to
do
anything
under
the
contract
because
he
wouldn't
have
a
grievance.
mr.
gerald
s.
boisits
all
right.
mr.
gerald
s.
boisits
for...
for
the
insurance
benefits?
mr.
gerald
s.
boisits
that
would
be
on
page
43.
mr.
gerald
s.
boisits
no.
they
are
a
committee
that
deals
solely
with
insurance-related
matters,
as
indicated--
mr.
gerald
s.
boisits
--yes,
we
are,
definitely.
mr.
gerald
s.
boisits
on
page
43,
second
paragraph,
it
says,
"the
committee
will
be
composed
of
two
members,
bargaining
committee.
"
et
cetera.
"it
shall
be
the
purpose
of
this
committee
to
discuss
for
resolution
any
insurance
issues.
"
and
then
it
says,
"questions
within
the
committee's
scope
shall
be
referred
to
and
shall
not
be
processed
in
the
first
three
steps
of
the
grievance
procedure.
"
mr.
gerald
s.
boisits
then
it
says,
"if
such
a
question
is
erroneously
presented
as
a
grievance,
it
shall
be
automatically
referred
to
the
committee,
but
it
may
be
presented
for
arbitration
in
the
established
manner
once
they
have
discussed
and
have
not
been
resolved.
"
mr.
gerald
s.
boisits
you
present
it
to
the
committee.
and
if
you
file
a
grievance--
mr.
gerald
s.
boisits
--no.
they're
going
to
look
it
over
and
discuss
it,
and
then
they're
going
to
say
we
agree,
we've
got
a
decision,
or
we
don't
have
a
decision
and
now
we're
going
to
go
to
arbitration.
mr.
gerald
s.
boisits
that
would
be
under
the
main
contract,
at
least
from
my
understanding
of
this,
justice.
perhaps
opposing
counsel
is
better
versed
as
far
as
that.
mr.
gerald
s.
boisits
yes.
mr.
gerald
s.
boisits
no.
mr.
gerald
s.
boisits
that's
one
of
the
reasons
we
brought
the
action,
justice.
thank
you.
mr.
gerald
s.
boisits
that's
correct.
once
he
filed
with
the
committee.
mr.
gerald
s.
boisits
justice,
it
is
my...
it
is
my
opinion
both
from
the
way
it
has
been
presented
by
allis-chalmers
that
those
letters
definitely
alter
the
contract.
they
indicate
specific
amendments
to
the...
to
the
contract
itself.
mr.
gerald
s.
boisits
thank
you,
justice.
