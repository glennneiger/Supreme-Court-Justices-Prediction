justice
stevens
well,
may
i
ask
you
on
that
point,
this
contract,
as
i
remember
it,
there's
some
supplementary
correspondence
about
insurance-related
matters,
that
they
had
some
kind
of
a
special
arbitration
procedure.
if
they
had
said
in
those
documents
insurance-related
matters
shall
include
arbitration
of
claims
that
the
company
was
slow
in
paying,
for
bad
faith
or
otherwise,
and
that
the
arbitrator
would
have
the
authority
to
grant
appropriate
relief
if
that
happens,
would
you
then
feel
you
had
to
go
through
that
procedure?
justice
stevens
well,
then,
may
i
ask
why
couldn't
one
argue
that
your
first
step
in
this
problem,
if
it's
a
general
problem,
is
to
ask
the
union
to
negotiate
such
a
provision,
or
to
bring
a
proceeding
and
see
whether
they
might
not
even
interpret
the
existing
documents
to
give
that
relief?
i
suppose
it's
conceivable
that
if
you
took
the
claim
to
arbitration
and
said
that
insurance-related
matters
includes
claims
of
this
kind
as
well,
and
if
you
have
very
sympathetic
facts,
as
presumably
you
do.
justice
stevens
well,
mr.
boisits,
i'm
looking
at
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
at
page
24
of
the
joint
appendix,
and
there's
a
provision
as
to
the
jurisdictional
authority
of
the
impartial
referee,
and
it
says,
"it's
defined
as,
and
limited
to,
a
determination
of
any
grievance
which
is
a
controversy
between
the
parties,
or
between
the
company
and
employee
covered
by
this
agreement
concerning
compliance
with
any
provisions
of
this
agreement,
and
is
submitted
to
him
consistent
with
the
provisions
of
this
agreement.
"
now,
i
don't
know.
that
seems
to
me
broad
enough
to
cover
the
kind
of
grievance
that
is
i
haven't
been
paid
my
benefits
in
time.
