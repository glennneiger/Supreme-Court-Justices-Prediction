justice
white
well,
that's
what
happens
under
collective
bargaining
agreements
all
the
time
where
you
have
to
go
through
the
grievance
procedure,
and
you
have
to
be...
you
have
to
settle
for
whatever
you
get
out
of
the
grievance
or
the
arbitrator.
justice
white
and
even...
even
if
the
employer
keeps
the
wages
that
you
are...
withholds,
wrongfully
withholds
wages
that
you
would
like
to
use
to
feed
your
family.
justice
white
would
you
say
that
this
agreement,
then,
this
agreement
that
was
provided
for
arbitration
of
disputes
about
this
very
plan,
is
contrary
to
public
policy?
is
that
what
you're
saying?
justice
white
it's
just
unenforceable,
that
provision
of
the
contract.
justice
white
well,
if
it's
enforceable,
why
can't
you
insist
that
he
go
to
arbitration?
justice
white
yes,
but
most
arbitration
provisions
say
that
the
arbitrator...
the
arbitrator's
decision
will
be
final
and
binding,
and
that's
all
you
get.
justice
white
well,
isn't
that
one
of
the...
so
the
employee
says
to
the...
says
to
the
employer
or
to
the
insurance
company
or
whoever
he's
talking
to,
you
haven't
paid
me
my
benefits,
and
furthermore,
you
have
not
done
it...
you've
done
it
in
bad
faith.
and
the
employer
says
well,
let's
arbitrate;
this
is
a
dispute
about
the
payment
of
these
benefits.
and
you
say
you
divide
that
up
into
two
things.
one
is
you
go
arbitrate
for
your
benefits,
and
you
sue
in
the
state
court
for
bad
faith.
justice
white
well,
that's--
--well,
if
the
union
became
convinced
that
allis-chalmers
was
horsing
some
of
its
members
around,
as
you
put
it,
on
these
disability
payments,
couldn't
the
union
decide
that
we
don't
want
to
submit
that
kind
of
thing
to
arbitration
and
simply
withdraw
that
from
the
arbitration
contract,
and
that
then
you'd
really
be
in
a
lot
better
position,
i
would
think.
justice
white
i
think
we
have
your
point
on
that,
counsel.
justice
white
could
you
tell
me
where
specifically
it
is
that
the
agreements
or
the
letter
of
understanding
require
that
claims
for
benefits,
disputed
claims
for
benefits
be
arbitrated?
justice
white
yes.
justice
white
now,
is
this
committee
that
that
letter
talks
about,
is
that
the...
are
they
the
arbitrators?
justice
white
well,
i
know,
but
now
you...
where
does
it
require
that...
we're
talking
about
an
insurance-related
matter,
aren't
we?
justice
white
and
tell
me
where
this
letter
requires
something
to
be
presented
to
arbitration.
justice
white
yes.
justice
white
well,
the
committee
is...
so
where
do
you
present
it
for
arbitration?
justice
white
so
the
committee
are
the
arbitrators.
justice
white
and
that
would
be
under
the
main
contract?
justice
white
but
that
word
"may"
is
in
there.
justice
white
now,
does
that
require
presentation
to
arbitration?
justice
white
well,
i
suppose--
justice
white
--if
the
company...
but
if
the
company
wanted
to
present
it
for
arbitration,
the
claimant
would
have
to
go
to
arbitration.
