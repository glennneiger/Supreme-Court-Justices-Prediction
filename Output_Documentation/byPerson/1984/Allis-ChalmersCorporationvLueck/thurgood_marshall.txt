if
we
join
you
and
make
this
exception
as
to
insurance
policies,
can
you
tell
me
anything
that
the
state
can't
also
do
and
wreck
the
whole
contract?
justice
marshall
yeah,
yeah.
justice
marshall
well,
can
you
name
something
that
they
couldn't
do?
couldn't
the
state
say
it's
against
our
policy
to
pay
a
minimum
wage?
justice
marshall
would
that
apply?
justice
marshall
why
not?
justice
marshall
something
that's
bound
by
the
contract.
justice
marshall
just
like
the
policy.
justice
marshall
is...
does
the
contract
in
any
way
say
that
this
benefit
under
the
policy
is
different
from
the
rest
of
the
contract?
justice
marshall
you
say
this
is
a
separate
part
of
the
contract.
justice
marshall
does
it
say
that
it
is
separated
from
the
contract
so
that
it
does
not
apply
to
arbitration?
justice
marshall
well,
then
how
can
you
say
so?
it's
just
the
contrary.
justice
marshall
well,
how
can
the
state
do
it?
justice
marshall
how?
justice
marshall
how
can
you
say
the
union
was
disinterested
in
this
case?
did
he
apply
to
the
union?
justice
marshall
well,
what
did
the
union
refuse
to
do?
justice
marshall
so
you
can't
complain
against
the
union.
justice
marshall
you
can't,
can
you?
justice
marshall
well,
why
try
to
do
it
now?
justice
marshall
but
the
supreme
court
of
wisconsin
didn't
consider
it
at
all,
did
they?
justice
marshall
that
provision.
did
it?
justice
marshall
it's
not
in
their
opinion
at
all,
is
it?
justice
marshall
--but
your
complaint
says
nothing
except
contract.
justice
marshall
your
complaint
in
this
case
says
nothing
except
a
violation
of
the
contract.
justice
marshall
it
doesn't
say
contract?
justice
marshall
it
doesn't
say
contract?
justice
marshall
well,
that's
all
it
said.
it
says
the
contract
with
aetna
life
and
casualty
company
under
contract
number
acs-558781.
you
can't
be
more
specific
than
that.
justice
marshall
but,
counsel,
that
letter
can't
alter
the
terms
of
the
contract,
can
it?
