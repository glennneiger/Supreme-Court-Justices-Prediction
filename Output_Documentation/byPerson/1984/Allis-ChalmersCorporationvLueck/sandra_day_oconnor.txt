mr.
kammholz--
justice
o'connor
--on
a
side
point,
may
i
inquire
whether
the
disability
plan
involved
here
is
governed
by
erisa?
justice
o'connor
i
have
one
question.
justice
o'connor
but
again,
it's
not
directly
related
to
the
facts
of
this
case
obviously.
but
assuming
for
purposes
of
the
question
that
your
position
is
correct
and
that
this
is
a
301
case,
if
it's
also
governed
by
erisa
are
there
any
conflicts
between
the
remedies
available
to
someone
in
the
circumstances
of
the
plaintiff
below
by
virtue
of
the
fact
that
it
might
also
be
an
erisa
plan?
justice
o'connor
both
being
federal
laws--
justice
o'connor
--but
with
different
remedial
approaches.
and
yet,
one
can't
help
but
be
struck
how
the
facts
of
this
case
and
the
one
that
was
just
argued
are
identical.
