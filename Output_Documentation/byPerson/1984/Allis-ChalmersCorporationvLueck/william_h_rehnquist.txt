justice
rehnquist
well,
would
it
have
been
all
right,
in
your
view,
if
the
supreme
court
of
wisconsin
had
adjudicated
this
case
but
applied
the
principles
of
federal
labor
law
that
you
say
are
derived
from
the
lincoln
mills
cases?
justice
rehnquist
well,
but
i...
my
question
was
was
it
all
right
for
the
supreme
court
of
wisconsin
to
have
adjudicated
this
case
so
long
as
it
applied
principles
of
federal
law
derived
from
the
lincoln
mills
trilogy?
justice
rehnquist
is
it
clear,
mr.
kammholz,
that
if
this
particular
respondent
had
a
claim
for...
under
this
plan
that
he
would
have
had
to
submit
it
to
arbitration
under
the
collective
bargaining
agreement?
justice
rehnquist
i
realize--
justice
rehnquist
--but
he's
bound
by
the
union's
contract
on
his
behalf
to
arbitrate
this
particular
kind
of
dispute,
as
i
understand
it.
justice
rehnquist
what
if
the
union...
do
you
think
the
union's
reason
is
that
it
might
be
a
defendant
in
such
a
claim?
justice
rehnquist
i
have
a
question,
mr.
kammholz.
supposing
that
in
this
contract
allis-chalmers,
instead
of
acting
as
a
self-insurer,
had
simply
provided
that
as
one
of
the
benefits
it
was
giving
employees
it
would
provide
them
with
a
disability
policy
with
aetna
life
insurance
company,
but
the
contract
also
said
that
any
disagreement
between
the
employees
and
aetna
life
insurance
company
over
the
payment
of
a
disability
would
be
submitted
to
arbitration
the
same
way
a
grievance
is
to
the
conditions
in
the
plant.
do
you
think
federal
labor
policy
requires
a
state
court
to
apply
federal
law
to
that
situation?
