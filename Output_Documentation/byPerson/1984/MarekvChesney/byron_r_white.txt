justice
white
how
did
you...
when
you
made
your
offer,
the
$100,000
offer,
you
said
it
included
attorney's
fees,
but
you
picked
out
an
amount,
didn't
you?
justice
white
oh,
you
did
not.
justice
white
i
thought
you
just
said
that
it
includes
attorney's
fees.
justice
white
and
it
was
only
after
the
trial
judge
figured
it
up
that
he
came
up
with
the
$32,000?
all
right,
thanks.
justice
white
well,
your
offer
was
for
both,
wasn't
it?
justice
white
is
it
settled
under
the
rule
that
the
judgment
that
is
actually
recovered...
when
you
are
making
the
comparison,
is
it
settled
that
you
take
the
damages,
the
actual
damages
that
are
awarded
plus
attorney's
fees
as
the
figure
to
compare?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
if
you
had
made
an
offer
of
$60,000,
excluding
attorney's
fees,
you
offered
to
settle
the
substantive
issue
for
$60,000,
and
then
there
had
been
awarded
$50,000
in
damages
and
$50,000
in
attorney's
fees?
justice
byron
r.
white
would
the
rule
have
applied
to
you
then,
or
do
you
know?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know,
but
i'm
still
interested
in
what
do
you
compare.
justice
white
if
you
made
a
$60,000
offer
excluding
attorney's
fees,
what
figure
do
you
compare
that
with
after
a
trial?
justice
white
all
right,
but
that
doesn't...
wouldn't
include
attorney's
fees.
justice
white
all
right.
so
if
the
actual
judgment
was
for
less
than
you
offered,
you
would
have
the
benefit
of
the
rule.
but
i
grant
you
would
still
have
a
hearing
on
attorney's
fees.
justice
white
but
you
would
only
be
liable
for
attorney's
fees
accrued
before
the
date
or
your
office.
justice
white
you
wouldn't
be
paying
for
post-offer.
justice
white
costs
but
not
attorney's
fees?
justice
white
why
did
they
break
it
down,
so
that
the
judge
could
enter
a
judgment?
is
that
it?
justice
white
so
you
think
under
the
rule,
under
rule
68,
you
can
make
your
offer
in
either
of
two
ways...
including
attorney's
fees
or
excluding
attorney's
fees?
justice
white
you
have
to?
why?
justice
white
well,
i
take
it
the
petitioner
seemed
to
think
that
you
could
make
the
offer
just
for
the
amount
of
the
damages
and
not
include
attorney's
fees.
justice
white
well,
i
am
sure
that
in
my
thoughts
i
thought
he
said
he
could
make
the
offer
just
for
the
amount
of,
just
for
damages,
not
including
attorney's
fees.
justice
white
you
disagree
with
him?
justice
white
you
think,
then,
it's
not
only
that
this
is
a
proper
kind
of
an
offer
but
it's
the
only
kind
of
an
offer
to
be
made
in
a
1988
case,
including
attorney's
fees?
justice
white
what
seems
to
be
the
natural
consequence
of
rule
68?
justice
white
so
that
$40,000
of
costs
was
included
in
the
$170,000?
justice
white
if
that
figure
of
costs
of
$40,000
was
right,
the
pre-trial
and
trial
attorney's
fees
would
total
$130,000,
is
that
it?
justice
white
where
are
you
ever...
how
do
you
ever
get
the
right
to
recover
costs?
forget
attorney's
fees
for
a
moment.
justice
white
so
that's
a
statutory
provision?
justice
white
is
there
something
in
the
rules
about
it?
justice
white
but
i
would
suppose
that
if
you
win
a
civil
rights
case,
a
1988
case,
and
ask
for
attorney's
fees,
which
you
do
in
yours,
it's
awarded,
it's
taxed
as
part
of
costs
as
under
the
rule,
pursuant
to
that
rule.
justice
white
that's
what
1988
says.
