but
you
could
have
made
a
clearcut
offer,
couldn't
you?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
could
have
said
blank
dollars
plus
blank
dollars
for
fee,
couldn't
you?
wouldn't
that
have
been
an
offer?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
it
would
have
stopped
us
from
having
to
guess,
wouldn't
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
don't
we
have
to
guess
whether
you
made
an
offer
of
$100,000
for
both
or
one
item?
don't
we
have
to
guess
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
what
do
we
determine?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
in
these
cases
where,
according
to
you,
they
are
doing
the
government's
work
and
they
are
acting
as
private
attorneys
general,
and
for
that
reason
you
pay
them
five
times
what
the
attorney
general
gets?
isn't
there
something
wrong
with
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
trial
court
should
give
attorney's
fees
of
three
times
what
he
gets,
the
judge
gets?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
am
just
wondering
where
you
go
on
this.
