justice
stevens
mr.
perterson,
can
i
ask
you
this
one
question?
does
the
record
tell
us
what
the
hourly
rate
was
as?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it's
only
the
sum
of
the
two
components
if
the
offer
included
fees.
if
the
offer
had
just
been
for
the
liability,
then
i
don't
suppose
you'd
have
it.
justice
stevens
excuse
me.
can
i
ask
you
just
one
question?
in
your
view,
if
there
were
no
rule
68
and
the
plaintiff
here
were
entitled...
i
don't
know
if
the
figures
are
right...
to
a
$170,000
fee
under
1988,
would
you
characterize
the
right
to
the
$170,000
as
a
substantive
right
or
a
procedural
right?
justice
stevens
but
judge
posner
apparently
thought
that
was
important
because
of
the
limitations
on
what
the
rules
can
do;
that's
the
reason
i
asked
the
question.
justice
stevens
why
did
they
break
it
down?
justice
stevens
the
rule
doesn't
quite
say
that,
though.
the
rule
says
"may
make
an
offer",
and
then
one
of
the
elements
of
the
offer.
it
doesn't
say
"may"
or
"must",
either
one.
you
just
rely
on
the
fact
that
the
words
"with
costs
then
accrued"
are
in
the
sense--
justice
stevens
--but
the
verb
that
precedes
it
has
a
"may"
in
it.
but,
anyway,
that's
not
an
issue
in
this
case,
is
it?
justice
stevens
mr.
stone,
may
i
just
ask
this
question,
because
it's
kind
of
a
theme
that
underlies
a
good
deal
of
your
argument
that
the
operation
of
rule
68
frustrates
the
purpose
of
1988
and,
to
a
certain
extent,
1983.
how
does
it
frustrate
the
purpose
if
it
motivates
a
defendant
with
a
serious
case
before
him
promptly
to
make
a
serious
offer,
giving
the
plaintiff
early
in
the
litigation
at
least
the
advantage
of
a
real
bird
in
the
hand
rather
than
all
the
contingencies
with
a
long
law
suit?
isn't
that
consistent
with
the
purpose
of
1983
and
1988?
justice
stevens
doesn't
the
operation
of
the
rule
have
its
own
built-in
test
of
reasonableness
by
what
happens
later?
if
you
don't
recover
more
than
the
offer,
by
hypothesis,
you
fail
to...
the
offer
had
to
be
reasonable.
