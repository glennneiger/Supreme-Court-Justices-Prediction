mr.
victor
j.
stone
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
should
like
in
the
time
allotted
to
review
the
facts
of
the
case
somewhat
supplementarily,
but
not
lengthily,
to
rebut
a
few
of
the
points
made
in
the
preceding
oral
argument,
but
then
to
get
to
the
core
of
our
argument,
which
is
a
legal
argument,
as
to
the
meaning
of
costs
in
federal
rule
68,
the
linkage
alleged
by
the
opposition
to
exist
between
that
use
of
the
term
1988
of
title
xlii.
i
should
like
to
deal
also
with
the
relationship
of
the
rule's
enabling
act,
and
particularly
the
second
sentence
thereof,
and
its
relationship
to
and
interpretation
of
rule
68
that
is
urged
by
the
petitioner
in
this
particular
case.
then,
to
serve
what
i
shall
assert
is
the
vast
import
of
a
reversal
in
this
particular
case,
the
chaos
that
would
be
fostered
in
innumerable
classes
of
litigation
involving
fee-shifting
statutes
which
contain
both
the
words
"costs"
and
"attorney's
fees"
in
some
proximity
with
one
another.
if
i
may
begin,
your
honor,
i
would
like
first
of
all
to
remind
the
court,
although
this
has
already
been
read
to
the
court,
of
the
precise
language
of
the
offer
in
this
particular
case,
an
offer
to
allow
judgment
to
be
taken
against
them
by
the
plaintiff
for
a
sum,
including
costs
now
accrued
and
attorney's
fees,
of
$100,000.
mr.
victor
j.
stone
yes,
your
honor.
indeed,
if
i
may
empathize
with
trial
attorney,
i
would
have
been
puzzled
as
to
whether
costs
at
this
time
accrued
and
attorney's
fees
meant
that
attorney's
fees
were
limited
to
this
time
accrued,
whether...
i
would
be
wondering
what
the
point
was.
mr.
victor
j.
stone
that
may
very
well
be
true,
your
honor.
mr.
victor
j.
stone
if
judgment
were
entered
thereupon,
and
there
were
no
further
proceedings.
mr.
victor
j.
stone
if
i
understand
your
question,
your
honor,
it
is
to
the
effect
that
if
the
offer
were
accepted
and
judgment
entered
by
consent
there
could
be
no
further
attorney's
fees
in
the
case.
mr.
victor
j.
stone
that
would
be
about
all.
may
i,
however,
point
to
another
matter
that
derives
from
the
wording
of
the
offer
in
this
particular
case?
the
offer
in
this
particular
case
shows
an
awareness
that
as
of
that
moment
in
time,
at
least,
counsel
who
made
the
offer
must
have
been
aware
that
an
offer
of
costs
did
not
include
attorney's
fees;
therefore,
the
separate
mention
of
them
both,
of
the
two
items,
and
that,
i
should
think,
indicates
an
awareness
generally
among
the
bar
and
the
bench
and
the
decided
cases...
well,
there
were
practically
no
decided
cases...
but
an
understanding,
generally
accepted,
that
costs
within
rule
68
did
not
include
attorney's
fees.
mr.
victor
j.
stone
i
think
it
can
be
read
that
way,
your
honor,
and
we
do
not
make--
mr.
victor
j.
stone
--we
do
not
make
a
big
point,
your
honor,
nor
do
i
wish
really
to
urge
that
this
court's
decision
should
turn
upon
the
validity
or
invalidity
of
the
offer.
i
do
suggest
that
the
making
of
an
offer
in
this
form
presents
uncertainties
not
only
of
prediction
of
how
a
jury
will
resolve
disputed
questions
of
unliquidated
damages,
but
does
present
problems
of
determining
how
allocation
shall
be
made
of
a
lump
sum
as
between
client
and
attorney
and
so
on.
and
that,
i
believe,
is
a
point
that
must
be
kept
in
mind
in
this
particular
case--
mr.
victor
j.
stone
--yes.
mr.
victor
j.
stone
i
think
those
are
the
two
alternatives
that
occur
to
me,
your
honor.
if
the
offer
had
been
accepted,
then
client
and
attorney
would
be
required
to
negotiate
a
settlement
and,
failing
that,
present
it
to
the
court
for
adjudication.
in
this
particular
case,
if
the
court
please,
we
had
a
civil
rights
case
involving
a
police
action
that
resulted
in
the
death
of
a
21-year-old
man.
the
jury's
verdict
established
liability
for
the
civil
rights
violation
and
that
further
level
of
fault
which
is
necessary
to
find
in
order
to
warrant
the
assessment
of
punitive
damages.
concerning
the
offer
and
rejection
of
the
offer,
as
has
been
said
by
opposing
counsel,
the
reasonableness
of
the
offer
and
the
reasonableness
of
the
rejection
are
not
before
this
court
at
this
time.
i
regret,
however,
that
so
much
attention
has
been
paid
to
this
particular
subject
in
the
briefs
on
the
other
side
of
the
case,
and,
therefore,
it
seems
to
me
necessary
to
remind
the
justices
that
this
is
not
an
issue
in
the
case,
that
the
reasonableness
of
the
making
of
the
offer
and
the
reasonableness
of
the
rejection
have
not
been
determined
by
any
particular
court,
and,
as
this
court
has
cautioned
in
the
christianberg
clothing
case,
post
hoc,
20/20
hindsight
should
not
be
engaged
in
to
determine
whether
or
not
the
rejection
of
an
offer
on
the
date
and
time
and
with
the
awareness
then
present
should
be
considered
to
be
reasonable
or
unreasonable.
mr.
victor
j.
stone
no,
there
is
none,
your
honor.
and
therefore
i
shall
proceed
in
connection
with
this
case.
the
rejection
of
this
offer
in
this
case
did
lead
to
a
trial
and
to
a
judgment
which,
according
to
the
calculations
of
opposing
counsel,
amounted
to
a
total
judgment
of
$92,000.
that
is
very
easily
seen
to
be
eight
percent
less
than
the
amount
of
the
judgment,
if
one
excludes
court
costs.
and
that
makes
the
approximation
even
closer.
this
is
the
degree
of
calculation
upon
which
the
drastic
and
mandatory
consequences
of
rule
68
are
said
then
to
have
to
follow,
and
i
would
argue
that
that
is
making
a
mountain
move
as
a
result
of
a
very
small
movement
of
a
molehill.
the
linkage
which
must
be--
mr.
victor
j.
stone
--one
of
the
problems,
your
honor,
in
reading
rule
68
in
conjunction
with
any
provision
that
provides
for
reasonable
fees,
or
for
doing
anything
on
the
basis
of
a
flexible
standard
that
can
be
adapted
to
the
facts
and
circumstances
and
equities
of
a
particular
case,
one
of
the
grave
difficulties
is
the
mandatory
language
of
federal
rule
68,
which
allows
for
no
discretion
to
be
exercised.
and
may
i
point
out
in
this
particular
instance
and
in
response
to
your
question,
justice
white,
the
logic
of
the
position
taken
by
the
opposition
to
the
effect
that
there
is
a
linkage
between
section
1988
and
rule
68,
which
would
require
the
plaintiffs
to
forego
post-offer
fees
accrued
after
the
making
of
the
offer,
would
not
result
in
the
transfer
of
defendant's
fees
to
plaintiff
in
accordance
with
that
particular
incorporation
either.
the
reasonable
fees
which
a
court
may
discretionarily
award
pursuant
to
section
1988
are
or
they
are
not
included
within
68,
and
it
is
my
contention,
your
honors,
that
they
are
not
and
they
cannot
be.
may
i
recall
the
history
of
federal
rule
68,
in
its
present
form
only
slightly
altered
from
its
original
form,
which
became
effective
with
the
rest
of
the
federal
rules
in
1938?
the
word
1920
and
following.
under
the
rule's
enabling
act,
it
is
at
least
questionable
whether
congress
intended
to
authorize
the
making
of
rules
that
would
affect
substantive
rights,
and
here
i
must
state
my
strong
disagreement
with
the
assistant
solicitor
general
as
to
whether
the
award
of
attorney's
fees
is,
involves
a
substantive
right.
first
of
all,
the
dimensions
of
the
award
are
totally
inconsonant
with
those
relatively
minor
incidents
of
litigation
that
are
referred
to
as
"costs".
mr.
victor
j.
stone
both,
your
honor.
it
is
generally,
i
am
tempted
but
it
would
be
imprudent
to
say,
always
the
case
that
attorney's
fees
will
loom
rather
large
in
comparison
with
taxable
costs
under
section
1920
of
the
judicial
code.
mr.
victor
j.
stone
yes,
your
honor.
the
requests
for
attorney's
fees
and
costs
submitted
by
mr.
montgomery
in
trial
court...
please
excuse
me
if
i'm
slightly
inaccurate...
was
for
$171,000,
and
that,
incidentally,
included
pre-offer
and
post-offer
fees
and
costs,
of
which--
mr.
victor
j.
stone
--i
believe
$41,000,
or
approximately
$40,000
was
broken
down...
was
claimed
by
way
of
costs,
of
which
the
trial
judge
disallowed
a
portion.
mr.
victor
j.
stone
your
honor,
this
was
a
long,
hard-fought
case,
as
counsel
for
the
petitioner
has
said
to
the
court,
involving
eleven
days
in
court
and
innumerable
pre-trial
motions,
fully
briefed,
many
post-trial
motions,
fully
briefed.
the
days
in
court
have
been
described
as
trench
warfare.
i
think
the
figure
of
speech
carries--
mr.
victor
j.
stone
--i
think
normally
not,
your
honor,
but
i
can
think
of
certain
kinds
of
litigation
where
that
might
very
well
be
done.
i
also
have
read
cases
in
which
a
purely
nominal
amount
has
been
awarded
in
a
civil
rights
case,
and
in
which
a
very
substantial
attorney's
fee
has
been
awarded.
mr.
victor
j.
stone
if
all
that
were
issued,
your
honor,
were
the
private
parties'
recovery,
that
argument
would
be
more
persuasive,
but,
as
has
been
stated
in
opinions
of
this
court,
the
civil
rights
plaintiff
enters
the
court
wearing
the
mantle
of
the
public
interest,
seeking
to
vindicate
the
public
policy
as
well
as
the
injury
to
private
rights.
mr.
victor
j.
stone
i
should
suggest,
your
honor,
that
no
case
has
set
a
fixed
ratio
or
a
fixed
maximum
to
the
ratio
that
attorney's
fees
may
bear
to
recovery,
and
there...
but
there
are
cases
in
which
attorney's
fees
awards
have
exceeded
the
amount
of
damages
awarded
to
the
client.
mr.
victor
j.
stone
none
comes
to
mind
at
this
moment,
your
honor,
and...
but
i
do
recall
the
case,
i
believe,
of
cooper
v.
singer,
decided
by
the
tenth
circuit
en
banc
recently,
in
which
that
was
the
case.
i
believe
that
was
the
case.
i
must
be
cautious
in
not
overstating
my
memory.
mr.
victor
j.
stone
your
honor,
the
function...
it
is
the
responsibility
of
the
trial
judge
to
set
a
reasonable
attorney's
fee.
this
court,
in
hensley
v.
eckerhart,
gave
extensive
guidance
to
the
trial
courts
to--
mr.
victor
j.
stone
--the--
mr.
victor
j.
stone
--the
guidance
offered
by
hensley
v.
eckerhart,
your
honor,
was
not
in
terms
of
ratios,
fractions,
multiplying
factors;
it
was
in
terms
of
hours
spent
reasonably.
it
was
in
terms
of
reasonable
cost
per
hour.
mr.
victor
j.
stone
i
think,
your
honor,
that
hensley
gave
the
trial
judge
a
starting
point
to
reach
what
other
cases
have
called
a
lead-star
figure,
from
which
variation
can
then
be
made
on
a
variety
of
factors.
and
it
would
be
our
contention,
your
honor,
that
many
of
the
desired
goals
announced
by
the
opposition
in
this
case
for
giving
defendants
very
powerful
post-settlement
weapons
could
be
achieved
by
reasonable
administration
by
the
trial
judge
of
the
hensley
v.
eckerhart
standards
and
guidelines,
adjusted
to
and
taking
cognizance
of
the
purposes
that
inform
section
1988,
which
were
to
encourage
those
who
feel
that
they
have
been
denied
their
civil
rights
to
bring
their
cases
in
federal
court.
and
certainly
that
encouragement
should
not
be
rendered
negatory
or
lessened
by
an
interpretation
of
a
federal
rule
that
would
say
that
the
stakes
in
this
litigation
can
be
raised
beyond
any
measure
which
is
reasonable
to
the
plaintiff
by
the
making
of
an
offer
shortly
after,
and
it
can
be
made
under
federal
rule
68,
shortly
after
the
making
of
the
initiation
of
the
trial.
mr.
victor
j.
stone
if
i
recall
correctly,
your
honor,
defendant
made
a
post-trial
motion
in
which
there
was
a
request
made
for
determination
of
attorney's
fees,
but
no
specific
sum
was
mentioned;
is
that
correct?
mr.
victor
j.
stone
thank
you.
mr.
victor
j.
stone
yes,
your
honor,
that
was
the
request
which
included
pre
and
post-offer
attorney's
fees
plus
costs,
and
the
costs
were
very
substantial.
mr.
victor
j.
stone
in
the
request,
your
honor.
there
has
been
no
hearing
on
that.
mr.
victor
j.
stone
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
victor
j.
stone
yes,
your
honor.
there...
well,
i
don't
know
how
late
it
was.
there
was
certainly
awareness,
but
it
is
the
case
that
there
is
a
technical
failure
to
comply
with
a
rule
of
the
district
court
and
mr.
montgomery
has
informed
me
that
that
was
a
result
of
oversight
which,
needless
to
say,
he
regrets.
if
i
may,
i
should
like
to
deal
for
a
moment
with
section
1988
of
the
civil
rights
act.
this
was
amended,
as
this
court
well
knows,
following
this
court's
decision
in
the
alyeska
case,
which
said
that
attorney's
fees
could
not
be
awarded
on
the
court's
own
initiative,
with
several
acknowledged
exceptions...
the
bad
faith
exception,
common
fund-common
benefit
exception,
et
cetera...
without
specific
congressional
authorization.
almost
at
once
congress
acted
and
extensive
hearings
were
held
in
1975
and
in
1976.
one
of
the
consequences
of
those
hearings
was
the
legislation,
the
legislative
amendment
of
section
1988
of
the
civil
rights
statute,
the
statute
which
is
in
discussion
here
today.
that
section,
as
we
know,
tells
us
that
the
prevailing
plaintiff
may
recover
attorney's
fees
as
among
the
costs
in
the
particular
case.
it
is
contended
by
the
opposition
that
somehow
or
other
that
particular
language,
added
at
the
very
end
of
the
amendment,
establishes
a
linkage
between
section
1988
and
federal
rule
68.
it
is
our
contention,
your
honor--
mr.
victor
j.
stone
--how
do
we
get
that
right?
because
we
are
the
victorious
party,
your
honor,
and
under
section
1920
of
the
judicial
code--
mr.
victor
j.
stone
--that
is
a
statutory
provision,
your
honor.
mr.
victor
j.
stone
about
the
recovery
of
costs?
there
is
only
procedural
provision
for
the
taxing
of
costs
under
federal
rule
54(d),
if
i
recall
correctly.
mr.
victor
j.
stone
your
honor,
i
would
not
agree
that
it
is
taxed
as
a
part
of
costs.
mr.
victor
j.
stone
may
i
then
address
that
particular
point,
but
i
should
like
to
do
that
against
the
backdrop
of
recognizing
that
in
the
extensive
hearings
that
were
held
and
in
all
of
the
testimony
that
preceded
the
enactment
of
section
1988
there
is
not
one
word
to
suggest
a
recognition
by
any
witness,
any
member
of
congress,
by
anyone
that
the
purpose
of
the
enactment
could
be
frustrated
or
could
even
be
affected
by
any
linkage
with
any
of
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure
having
to
do
with
costs.
the
phraseology
that
was
used
was
phraseology
that
had
been
used
before.
federal
rule
68
had
been
in
existence
for
decades
with
no
attorneys--
mr.
victor
j.
stone
--your
honor,
you
describe
a
case
in
which
the
rule
might
work
that
way.
but
the
mechanics
of
the
rule
pay
no
attention
to
reasonableness;
therefore,
even
an
unreasonable
offer
could
immediately
set
the
risk
so
high
that
it
could
not
be
endured.
it
involves
a
kind
of
speculation,
particularly
in
a
case
like
this
where
there--
mr.
victor
j.
stone
--if
your
honor
please,
the
caution
against,
in
christianberg
against
using
a
post-hoc
assessment
of
what
was
reasonable
beforehand
is,
i
think,
a
peril
that
we
do
not
want
to
impose
upon
parties.
there
has
been
extensive
insinuation
that
there
is
an
incentive
for
lawyers
to
go
ahead
and
keep
the
time
clock
running,
but
again
there
is
zero
evidence
in
the
record
or
anywhere
else
that
this
is
a
prevalent
evil.
what
your
honor
has
suggested
is
that
there
is,
that
there
is
a
possible
wholesome,
salutary
operation
of
federal
rule
68
in
promoting
the
making
of
an
offer.
where
the
offer
is
reasonable,
that
may
very
well
be
the
case.
but
i
would
suggest
to
your
honor
that
it
is
also
an
encouragement
to
defendants
to
make
an
offer
that
it
at
the
very
bottom
of
whatever
range
could
be
possibly
considered
to
be
reasonable.
mr.
victor
j.
stone
if
i
am
to
rate
it
on
the
basis
of
what
appears
in
the
record
before
this
court,
your
honor,
i
would
rate
it--
mr.
victor
j.
stone
--excuse
me,
your
honor?
mr.
victor
j.
stone
one
can
do
that,
with
the
benefit
of
hindsight,
yes,
your
honor,
but
if
one
may
go
back
to
that
date
upon
which
the
offer
was
made,
the
question
of
liability
or
non-liability
had
not
been
decided,
and
that
was
a
disputed,
hotly-fought
issue.
also,
there
was
in
the
offing
testimony
by
an
economist
to
the
effect
that
the
lost
earnings
over
the
lifetime
of
the
decedent
would
amount
to
a
half
million
dollars.
there
was
a
colloquy
in
judge's
chamber
in
which
estimates
were
made,
and
the
estimates
that
were
made,
and
this
is
in
document
number
157
in
the
documents
submitted
by
the
court
of
appeals,
the
range
was
between
$100,000
estimated
by
one
defense
counsel,
$150,000,
estimated
by
another
defense
counsel,
and
the
sum
of
$500,000,
estimated
by
plaintiff's
counsel.
the
experienced
trial
judge
found
that
none
of
these
was
reasonable,
and
so
in
terms
of
what
is
reasonable
we
really
have
no
basis
for
saying
that
an
attorney...
a
plaintiff's
attorney
who
accepted
an
offer
of
$100,000
at
that
time
might
very
well
have
been
professionally
irresponsible
in
advising
acceptance
of
that
kind
of
sum
on
the
basis
of
the
prospects
reasonably
to
be
expected.
but,
your
honor,
if
you
please,
reasonableness
simply
is
not
in
the
case.
federal
rule
68
does
not
require
reasonableness
in
order
to
be
triggered.
if
i
may
return
to
section
1988
and
its
enactment,
i
have
stated
that
in
the
extensive
hearings
and
debates
on
the
enactment
of
the
1976
amendment
there
was
absolutely
zero
evidence
of
any
awareness,
let
alone
attention,
that
there
should
be
a
linkage
between
that
provision
and
any
of
the
federal
rules
announcing
costs.
where
congress
has
acted
regarding
costs,
it
has
called
them
costs,
such
as
in
the
judicial
code.
where
it
has
acted
in
regard
to
attorney's
fees,
in
a
whole
variety
of
statutes,
which
are
listed
handily
for
us
by
petitioner's
brief
and
the
brief
of
the
solicitor
general,
congress
has
always
acted
to
further
a
substantive
purpose
related
to
a
particular
statute,
whether
it
be
in
the
commerce
legislation
in
title
xv,
whether
it
be
elsewhere
in
title
xlii,
or
in
any
of
the
many
other
titles
of
the
united
states
code
where
attorney's
fees
are
shifted
by
congressional
action.
if
i
may,
your
honor,
then,
i
would
conclude
by
saying
costs
are
costs,
and
fees
are
fees.
the
conjunction
of
those
two
words
at
the
end
of
section
1988
establishes
no
linkage.
indeed,
the
historical
evidence
is
that
there
simply
was
not
linkage.
that
cannot
be
manufactured.
the
many,
many
assertions
in
briefs
to
the
effect
that
this
was
intended
or
it
must
be
assumed
or
it
is
apparent
are
simply
a
tissue
of
wishful
thinking.
mr.
victor
j.
stone
for
that
purpose,
your
honor,
which
is
a
sole
purpose
identified
by
this
court
in
hutto,
and
recognized
by
a
court
of
appeals,
for
the
sole
purpose
of
resolving
doubts
as
to
whether
eleventh
amendment
immunity
would
prevent
assessment
of
attorney's
fees
against
the
state.
and
yes,
that
purposes
is
clear
and
that
is
the
sole
purpose
that
has
been
attributed
to
that
conjunction
of
words
used
at
the
end
of
sectin
1988,
the
sole
purpose
that
has
been
attributed
to
it
by
any
court
in
the
reported
decisions.
mr.
victor
j.
stone
well,
your
honor,
i
shall
give
you
the
obvious
and
expected
answer
that
i
think
it
cannot
be,
should
not
be,
that
that
would
be
a
distortion
of
the
congressional
purpose
and
that
would
be
a
frustration
of
the
congressional
purpose.
the
allowance
of
federal
rule
68,
your
honors,
to
raise
stakes,
to
allow
defendants
so
to
raise
the
stakes
of
non-settlement
of
a
civil
rights
claim
brought
under
section
1983
of
the
civil
rights
or
in
the
grouping
of
other
statutes
with
comparable
language,
this
is
a
result
which
we
ask
this
court
not
to
allow
and
the
consequence
is
a
request
for
affirmant.
i
thank
the
court
for
its
attention.
