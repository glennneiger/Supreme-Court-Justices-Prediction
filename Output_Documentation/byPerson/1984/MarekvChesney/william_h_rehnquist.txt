justice
william
h.
rehnquist
was
there
any
request
for
injunctive
relief
in
this
case,
or
was
it
just
a
damages
action?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
prevailed
on
that
point
in
the
trial?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
then
you're
talking
about...
how
much
was
awarded
in
the
way
of
damages?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
how
can
a
court
award
$173,000
attorney's
fees,
where
all
the
plaintiff
recovered
was
$60,000?
don't
the
attorney's
fees
have
to
bear
some
proportion
to
the
value
of
what
was
recovered?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
why
wouldn't
rule
68
prevail
in
its
special
circumstances
over
1988
in
that
situation?
justice
rehnquist
no
case
from
this
court,
mr.
stone,
has
ever
decided
that
there
is
a
reasonableness
requirement
in
connection
with
rule
68,
has
it?
justice
rehnquist
mr.
stone,
are
you
speaking
of
the
dimensions
of
the
award
in
this
particular
case,
or
just
generally
the
relationship
between
the
amount
of
fees
and
the
amount
of
costs?
justice
rehnquist
well,
do
you
think
if
you
recover,
if
you
represent
a
plaintiff
and
recover
a
judgment
for
$50,000
or
$60,000
for
the
plaintiff,
do
you
think
you
can
bill
the
plaintiff
$170,000
for
your
attorney's
fees?
justice
rehnquist
well,
don't
you
think
the
ordinary
principle
of
a
billing
is
that
the
fee
has
to
have
some
relationship
to
the
amount
recovered
where
all
that's
at
issue
is
damages?
justice
rehnquist
and
that
justifies
an
award
of
attorney's
fees
three
times
the
amount
of
damages?
justice
rehnquist
any
approved
by
this
court?
