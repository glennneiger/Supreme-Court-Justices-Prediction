mr.
peterson,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
burger
what's
the
pertinent
language
there?
chief
justice
burger
let
me
see
if
i
understand
you,
mr.
peterson.
are
you
saying
that
your
offer
was
$100,000
divided
up
any
way
you
want
to?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
your
time
has
expired
now,
mr.
peterson.
mr.
ganzfried.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
stone.
chief
justice
burger
do
you
see
any
ambiguity
in
that?
chief
justice
burger
well,
if
the
offer
were
accepted,
there
wouldn't
be
any
more
services
to
be
performed,
would
there?
chief
justice
burger
may
very
well?
any
other
alternative?
what
fees
would
there
be
to
get
this
settlement?
doesn't
that
cut
it
off?
chief
justice
burger
what
other
proceedings
could
there
be?
what
jurisdiction
would
any
court
have
after
the
stipulation
were
entered?
chief
justice
burger
just
sending
somebody
down
to
the
courthouse
to
file
the
papers;
wouldn't
that
be
about
all?
chief
justice
burger
you
don't
agree
with
your
friends
characterizing
that
proposal
as
an
offer
to
pay
$100,000,
divided
up
any
way
you
want
between
counsel
and
client,
client
and
counsel?
you
don't
read
that
offer
as
that
kind
of
an
offer?
chief
justice
burger
what
other
way
could
it
be
read?
chief
justice
burger
one
more
hypothetical.
chief
justice
burger
if
you
had
accepted
the
offer
under
your
practice
in
your
courts,
what
would
you
have
done...
tried
to
agree
with
the
client
on
the
division
of
the
$100,000
or,
if
you
couldn't
agree,
then
submit
it
to
the
court
and
let
the
court
fix
the
fee?
which,
or
what
third
alternative
might
there
be?
chief
justice
burger
what's
the
breakdown
here?
do
you
have
it
in
mind,
dollars?
chief
justice
burger
how
much
are
the
costs?
chief
justice
burger
it
seems
a
staggering
amount
in
this
setting,
but
we
will
check
that.
chief
justice
burger
well,
did
hensley
really
get
into
any
of
the
issues
we're
dealing
with
here
under
rule
68?
chief
justice
burger
how
do
you
rate
this
one?
how
do
you
rate
this
offer?
chief
justice
burger
you
have
to
leaven
that
with
what
happened
in--
chief
justice
burger
--you'd
have
to
leaven
that
with
what
happened
in
the
trial
court.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
