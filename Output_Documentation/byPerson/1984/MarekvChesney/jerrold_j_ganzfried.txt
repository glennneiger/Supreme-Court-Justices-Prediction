mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
question
in
this
case
is
a
very
practical
on,
whether
rule
68
must
be
read
in
a
way
that
rewards
a
lawyer
even
at
the
expense
of
his
client.
because
of
some
mistaken
notions
of
policy,
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
an
attorney's
fee
of
$32,000,
more
than
50
percent
of
the
damage
award,
was,
as
a
matter
of
law,
unacceptable,
and
that
fees
should
be
reconsidered
and
awarded
for
work
that
obviously
produced
no
benefit
to
the
client.
we
submit
that
the
decision
below
is
in
error.
it
fails
to
honor
the
plain
meaning
of
the
language
congress
employed
in
section
1988,
that
costs
include
attorney's
fees.
the
decision
also
undercuts
the
purpose
of
rule
68,
as
expressed
in
the
delta
air
lines
case,
that
is,
to
encourage
settlement.
and,
finally,
the
court
of
appeals
incorrectly
perceived
a
conflict
between
rule
68
and
section
1988,
a
conflict
between
rule
68
and
in
fact
the
intent
of
virtually
all
the
federal
fee-shifting
statutes.
and
we
submit
that
there
is
nothing
in
the
scores
of
federal
fee-shifting
statutes
that
is
incompatible
with
the
objective
of
settling
law
suits.
those
laws
were
passed
not
simply
to
underwrite
plaintiffs
as
an
end
in
itself,
but
for
the
broader
purpose
of
ensuring
that
lack
of
funds
will
not
prevent
an
aggrieved
party
from
vindicating
his
statutory
or
constitutional
rights.
and
the
vindication
of
the
client's
right
is
a
goal
that
we
submit
can
be
achieved
just
as
effectively
and,
in
many
instances,
more
effectively
by
settlement
than
it
can
be
by
continuing
to
litigate
law
suits
through
trial
and
appeal.
now
by
definition,
in
rule
68
cases,
the
client
has
achieved
his
greatest
vindication
when
that
offer
of
judgment
is
made,
and
at
that
point
the
attorney's
fee
provision
has
satisfied
its
objective.
it's
served
its
purpose.
if
a
plaintiff
turns
down
that
vindication
and
continues
to
litigate,
there
is
no
policy
reason
to
continue
to
subsidize
his
litigation
and
to
continue
to
subsidize
his
lawyer
from
pursuing
that
litigation,
litigation
which,
by
definition,
will
result
in
a
detriment
to
his
client.
our
reading
of
rule
68--
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
--if
i
had
to
choose
between
those
two
words,
i
would
say
that
it's
procedural.
certainly
that's
what
the
court
indicated
in
hutto
v.
finney.
on
the
other
hand,
i
don't
think
that
that
is
necessarily
appropriate.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
well,
i
understand
that,
but
i
suggest
that
judge
posner
is
incorrect
on
that,
for
two
primary
reasons.
first,
that
he
was
relying
on
the
erie
line
of
cases,
the
diversity
cases.
we
don't
have
a
federal-state
issue
in
this
case.
and,
second,
i
suggest
that
this
court
has
rejected
that
substance-procedure
test,
and
let
me
refer
the
court
to
a
case
that
is
not
cited
in
our
brief.
it's
the
american
pipe
and
construction
company
case
v.
utah.
it's
in
414
us,
page
538,
in
which
the
court
specifically
rejected
the
substance-procedure
dichotomy
and
said
that
the
test
is
whether,
in
that
case
it
was
the
tolling
of
the
statute
of
limitations,
the
test
is
whether
by
a
court
doing
that
in
a
given
context
it
is
acting
in
consonance
with
the
legislative
scheme
in
which
the
statute
of
limitations
appeared.
now
our
reading
of
rule
68
is
consistent
with
the
principles
of
providing
attorney's
fees
that
this
court
has
announced
in
smith
v.
robinson
and
hensley
v.
eckerhart.
the
rule
allows
the
court
easily
to
draw
the
distinction
that
is
described
in
smith
v.
robinson,
that
is,
the
clear
line
between
hours
of
work
that
contributed
to
a
plaintiff's
success
and
those
that
did
not.
rule
68
establishes
a
conclusive
presumption
that
the
hours
spent
after
the
offer
was
rejected
did
not
in
any
way
contribute
to
the
plaintiff's
success,
and
fees
should
not
be
awarded
for
such
counter-productive
efforts.
we
argue
also
that
the
court
of
appeals
opinion
would
make
settlements
less
likely
by
encouraging
counsel
to
reject
reasonable
offers,
secure
in
the
knowledge
that
the
meter
will
continue
to
run
and
that
any
recovery
at
trial,
no
matter
how
small,
will
pay
for
every
tick
of
the
meter.
now
that
result
is
directly
contrary
to
what
this
court
has
called
the
"national
policy
to
minimize
the
cost
of
litigation.
"
a
policy
that
is
strongly
emphasized
in
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure.
the
court
said
that
in
1964
in
farmer
v.
arabian-american
oil
company.
we
submit
that
the
reed
to
control
litigation
costs
is
even
more
pronounced
now
than
it
was
in
1964.
now
let's
recognize
how
the
attorney's
fee
provisions
operate.
they
provide
a
powerful
incentive
for
a
defendant
to
settle
because
as
a
case
drags
on
the
defendant
faces
exposure
to
the
damage
award,
he
faces
exposure
to
the
plaintiff's
attorney's
fees
and,
of
course,
he
has
to
bear
the
continuing
cost
of
defending
the
law
suit.
the
defendants
thus
have
strong
pressures
to
settle,
but
obviously
they
can't
do
that
alone,
and
that's
where
rule
68
fits
in.
it
provides
a
similar
incentive
to
bring
the
plaintiffs
to
the
bargaining
table.
we
submit
also
that
the
decision
below
is
inconsistent
with
congress'
purpose
of
preventing
windfalls
for
lawyers,
a
purpose
this
court
recognized
in
blum
v.
stenson.
to
that
end,
congress
authorized
courts,
in
their
discretion,
to
award
reasonable
fees
adequate
to
attract
competent
counsel.
now
one
need
only
imagine
the
meeting
at
which
counsel
tells
his
client
that
it
will
cost
him
some
$200,000
in
fees
to
lose
$8,000
in
his
judgment
to
conclude
that
the
resulting
fee
is
unreasonable.
and,
as
the
court
noted
in
hensley,
the
hours
that
are
not
profitably
billed
to
one's
client
also
are
not
properly
billed
to
one's
adversary,
pursuant
to
the
statutory
authority.
in
short,
our
position
is
that
the
billing
judgment
principle
that
the
court
described
in
hensley
is
equally
applicable
here.
counsel
should
be
expected
to
exercise
litigation
judgment,
settlement
judgment,
in
a
way
that
encourages
settlements
by
eliminating
the
windfall
that
the
court
of
appeals
approved,
and
in
our
view,
when
read
correctly,
rule
68
does
precisely
that.
i'd
like
to
respond
to
one
point
that
came
up
during
petitioner's
argument.
the
question
of
the
validity
of
the
offer
in
this
case
is
not
before
this
court.
the
parties
stipulated
that
the
pre-offer
fees
were
$32,000,
so
while
the
initial
offer
did
not
have
breakdown,
as
the
parties
stand
before
the
court
that
figure
has
been
broken
down.
it's
been
broken
down
to
$32,000
for
costs,
including
attorney's
fees,
and
$68,000
for
damages.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
excuse
me?
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
the
fee
request
was
made
for
pre-offer
fees
of
34,000
some-odd
dollars.
the
judge
asked
the
parties
to
consult
on
the
figure,
and
they
agree
that
the
pre-offer
cost
plus
attorney's
fees
was
$32,000,
and
that's
where
the
figure
comes
from.
so
as
the
case
reached
the
seventh
circuit
and
as
it
comes
to
this
court,
we
have
an
offer
that
the
parties,
by
stipulation,
have
broken
down
to
$32,000
and
the
remainder
for
damages.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
well,
we
think
that
in
order
to
make
a
valid
rule
68
offer
you
have
to
make
it
including
attorney's
fees.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
because
in
a
case
in
which
attorney's
fees
are
subject
to
recovery,
such
as
in
1988,
because
the
offer
must
include
costs
then
accrued.
if
costs
includes
attorney's
fees,
then
the
figure...
the
offer
of
judgment
must
include
the
attorney's
fees
as
well.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
in
a
1988
case?
in
a
1988
case,
a
defendant
who
is
in
a
position
to
take
advantage
of
rule
68
can
recover
only
his
costs
exclusive
of
attorney's
fees,
because
under
section
1988
he
is
not
the
prevailing
party,
and
so
we
don't
have
a
situation
where
defendants
will
ever
be
in
a
position
to
recover
attorney's
fees
from
plaintiffs,
because
under
delta,
in
order
for
rule
68
to
shift
anything,
the
plaintiff
must
have
prevailed
and
if
plaintiff
prevails
then
the
defendant
can't
recover
his
attorney's
fees.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
well,
i'm
not
sure
he
said
that,
since
his
offer
did
include
attorney's
fees.
it
simply
didn't
specify
a
particular
amount
for
attorney's
fees.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
well--
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
--i
disagree
with
that.
in
cases
in
which
attorney's
fees
are
recoverable
by
plaintiff--
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
--as
a
rule
68.
obviously,
our
position
is
that
the
parties
are
perfectly
free
to
settle
cases
on
any
basis
they
like,
but
in
order
for
rule
68
to
operate
the
offer
must
include
the
attorney's
fees.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
with
costs
then
accrued,
that's
right.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
no,
the
validity
of
the
offer
is
not
in
issue
in
this
case,
additionally
because
there's
no
cross
petition
that's
been
filed.
the
court
of
appeals
concluded
that
it
was
a
valid
offer,
and
should
this
court
conclude
that
the
offer
was
invalid,
it
would
be
providing
the
respondents
greater
relief
than
they
got
in
the
court
of
appeals,
and
since
they
filed
no
cross
petition
that
would
not
be
an
issue
that's
before
the
court.
thank
you.
