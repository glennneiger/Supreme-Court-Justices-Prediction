mr.
donald
g.
peterson
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
the
facts
of
this
case
are
important
to
this
court
for
two
reasons:
one,
to
decide
this
case
and;
two,
to
evolve,
to
develop,
to
define
the
principles
that
should
be
applied
in
the
future.
the
facts
of
this
case
are
that
in
october
of
1979
a
law
suit
was
brought
pleading
a
cause
of
action
under
1983.
two
years
later,
after
the
case
had
been
pending
in
the
northern
district
of
illinois,
the
defendant,
the
petitioner
here,
made
an
offer
to
the
complainant.
the
offer
was
a
substantial
offer.
the
offer
was
$100,000.
after
the
offer
of
$100,000
was
made,
pre-trial
conferences
were
held,
discovery
was
reopened,
the
case
proceeded.
that
was
november
5,
1971.
in
april
of
1982
this
case
proceeded
to
trial.
the
negotiations
had
proved
unsuccessful.
the
attempt
to
resolve
this
case
without
a
jury
trial
proved
unsuccessful.
a
long,
hard-fought,
well-fought
and
fairly-fought
struggle
took
place
in
that
courtroom,
with
expert
witnesses
on
police
procedure,
with
expert
witnesses
on
ballistics,
with
expert
witnesses
on
criminal
evidence.
when
the
jury
went
back
to
deliberate,
they
had
about
three
weeks
of
proceedings
that
they
had
heard.
the
attorney
representing
the
plaintiff
at
trial,
representing
the
respondent
here,
was
an
outstanding
and
excellent
and
effective
advocate
of
his
client's
case.
he
had
not
with
his
client
agreed
to
accept
the
$100,000
that
was
offered
him.
for
the
defendant
to
offer
that
plaintiff
$100,000
meant
that
that
defendant's
attorney
had
to
persuade
his
clients
and
principals
to
come
up
with
that
money,
because
under
rule
68,
when
that
offer
is
put
on
paper,
when
that
offer
is
served,
the
plaintiffs...
excuse
me,
the
defendant,
the
petitioner
here,
is
going
to
have
to
live
with
it,
because
the
plaintiff
may
take
it.
and
if
the
plaintiff
takes
it,
there
is
a
judgment
entered
and
the
defendant
can
do
nothing
but
pay
that
judgment.
the
defendant,
petitioner
here,
before
making
the
offer
had
to
evaluate
the
case,
had
to
study
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure...
i
believe
there's
86
of
them;
this
is
rule
68...
had
to,
under
the
state
of
the
law
as
it
existed
at
that
time,
make
a
judgment
as
to
how
to
use
68
and
how
it
might
affect
or
be
affected
by
1988.
if
the
defendant
on
that
occasion,
november
5,
1981,
when
he
made
that
offer,
if
he
did
not
offer
attorney's
fees
to
the
plaintiff,
if
he
did
not
indicate,
as
he
did,
that
attorney's
fees
were
included
in
the
offer,
i
suggest
that
when...
if
the
plaintiff
had
accepted
the
offer
the
plaintiff
would
have
come
back
to
the
court
and
asked
the
court
to
assess
attorney's
fees
stacked
on
top
of
that
$100,000.
in
this
case,
the
fees
accrued
or
alleged
to
be
accrued
in
the
trial
court
amount
to
around
$171,000
perhaps
even
$173,000.
without
making
that
offer
as
it
was
made,
petitioners
would
have
put
$100,000
on
the
table,
had
it
taken
away
from
them,
and
exposed
themselves
to
the
potential
of
another
$171,000
or
$173,000.
the
plain
meaning
of
1988
authorized,
sanctions,
and
encourages
what
the
defendant
did.
what
the
defendant
did
in
these
circumstances
was
fair.
it
was
fair
to
the
plaintiff;
it
was
fair
to
the
defendant.
mr.
donald
g.
peterson
justice
rehnquist,
the
complaint
in
this
case
did
have
injunctive
relief.
it
pled
in
the
complaint
that
the
police
officers
in
question
should
be
disarmed,
that
the
village
of
berkeley
should
undertake
to
do
that.
the
village
of
berkeley
ended
up
with
a
verdict
of
not
guilty.
but
there
was
injunctive
relief
in
this
case,
and
an
offer
including
injunctive
relief
was
not
made.
we
did
not
offer
to
disarm
the
police
officers
or
give
them
any
of
the
other
remedies
they
sought.
mr.
donald
g.
peterson
we
prevailed
on
that
point.
mr.
donald
g.
peterson
the
award
damages
in
the
aggregate
is
$60,000.
mr.
donald
g.
peterson
well,
the
trial
court,
of
course,
has
not,
justice
rehnquist,
at
this
point
awarded
$171,000
or
$173,000.
the
trial
court
at
this
point
has
awarded
$32,000
and
has
entered
judgment
on
verdict
or,
excuse
me,
has
entered
judgment
for
$32,000.
i
believe
the
court
is
suggesting
that
the
trial
court,
if
this
case
were
to
be
remanded
on
this
issue,
would
have
to
take
that
into
account.
i'm
suggesting
to
this
court
that
the
result
here
is
not
a
remand
but
merely
a
reversal
of
the
seventh
circuit.
in
this
case,
$32,000
has
been
paid
in
attorney's
fees.
this
is
important.
this
defendant
has
never,
has
never
attempted
to
challenge
1988
or
suggest
that
it
shouldn't
be
used,
it
shouldn't
be
applied.
this
defendant
has
acted
within
the
rules,
the
rules
in
terms
of
the
statute,
which
is
1988,
cognizant
of
it,
made
an
offer,
took
it
into
account.
this
defendant
continued
to
play
under
the
rules
by
paying
the
judgment,
$60,000
judgment
after
$100,000
offer.
the
defendant
didn't
stop
there.
the
plaintiff
refused
that
money,
the
money.
two
days
after
the
judgment
was
entered
on
the
verdict
the
defendant
deposited
the
money
to
the
clerk
of
district
court
pursuant
to
the
order
of
the
trial
judge.
since
the
plaintiff
won't
take
it,
defendant
deposited
it
to
the
court.
defendant
didn't
stop
there
either.
a
fee
petition
had
been
filed.
the
fee
petition
indicated
that
the
plaintiff
alleged
approximately
$34,000
in
fees
accrued
before
the
offer,
that
is,
before
november
5
of
1981.
it's
an
itemized
accounting,
bill
of
accounting,
of
$34,000.
the
defendant
and
the
plaintiff
sat
down
and
they
negotiated
$2,000
off
it.
the
defendant
took
$32,000
in
addition
to
the
$60,000
and
put
that
in
the
district
court
clerk,
too.
before
this
case
ever
went
to
the
seventh
circuit,
$92,000
were
paid.
sixty
thousand
dollars
of
that
money
was
a
judgment
on
verdict.
thirty-two
thousand
dollars
was
the
pre-trial
accrued
attorney's
fees
of
the
plaintiff.
the
seventh
circuit
took
the
case
and
reversed,
and
when
the
seventh
circuit
reversed,
the--
mr.
donald
g.
peterson
--one
hundred
and
fifty
dollars
an
hour
for
the
lead
attorney,
your
honor,
and
the
trial
judge,
judge
shadur,
did
review
this
and
felt
that
$150
was
appropriate.
defendent,
your
petitioner,
has
not
asked
this
court
to
review
the
hourly
rate,
has
not
asked
this
court
to
review
judge
shadur,
has
not
filed...
excuse
me.
we
filed
the
petition
for
cert.
there
has
been
no
cross
petition
for
cert.--
one
hundred-fifty
an
hour
was
awarded,
plus,
for
the
associate
counsel,
lower
hourly
rates
in
the
vicinity
of
$70,
$80
an
hour
were
awarded.
the
plaintiff
has
been
well
compensated
in
this
law
suit
for
his
services.
taking
into
account
he
was
offered
$100,000
and
only
got
$60,000,
he
didn't
have
a
bad
day
in
court.
i
would
like
to
address
myself--
mr.
donald
g.
peterson
--no,
i
did
not--
mr.
donald
g.
peterson
--no.
mr.
donald
g.
peterson
that's
right.
mr.
donald
g.
peterson
the
way
it
works,
as
i
see
it
or
i
envision
it,
and
this
case,
i
think,
is
an
excellent
fact
case
for
this
court
to
see
how
this
whole
thing
evolves,
at
the
moment
that
judge
shadur
entered
judgment
on
verdict
for
$60,000,
we
didn't
really
know,
in
my
opinion,
we
really
didn't
know
whether
or
not
the
offer
at
that
very
moment
did
exceed
the
result
finally
obtained.
we
didn't
know
whether
it
was
in
fact
more
favorable
or
not.
but
we
did
know
it
the
moment
that
judge
shadur
entered
judgment
for
the
$32,000
in
attorney's
fees.
that's
when
we
knew
it.
i
am
cognizant
of
some
of
the
earlier
developments
before
this
court,
for
instance,
in
delta
v.
august,
where
that
issue
has
been
troublesome
to
some
of
the
justices,
at
least.
i
do
suggest
to
this
court
that
the
only
workable
solution
to
this
problem
is
exactly
what
we
did,
and
it's
a
beautifully
logical
result,
and
it's
a
fair
result.
it
is
in
fact
the
result
that
doesn't
take
a
lot
of
litigation
to
resolve.
i
would
like
to
follow
up
on
the
point
that
you
are
raising,
justice
white.
at
the
point
the
$60,000
judgment
on
verdict
is
entered,
we
do
not
know
how
that
stacks
up
against
the
$100,000
offer.
in
this
instance,
the
two
sides
agreed
$32,000
was
the
amount
of
pre-offer
fee.
the
judge
entered
judgment
on
verdict
for
the
$32,000.
i
believe
this
court
should
ask
itself
the
next
questions:
what
if
in
fact
they
couldn't
agree?
the
first
step
in
the
solution
to
that
problem
is
that
district
court
is
going
to
have
to
adjudicate
that
issue,
and
there
is
a
body
of
law,
obviously,
upon
which
that
is
going
to
be
measured.
the
court's
discretion
in
awarding
those
fees,
the
district
court's
discretion,
is
governed
by
a
body
of
common
law
and
it's
developed
in
large
part
out
of
this
court.
if
when
the
district
court
has
done
so
it
determines
that
not
$32,000,
in
the
case
before
you,
but
some
larger
sum,
such
as
$40,000,
$45,000,
$60,000
whatever
number
they
decide,
he
decides,
will
then
determine
whether
or
not
the
offer
is
more
favorable
or
not.
it
is
the
sum
of
the
two
component's,
in
my
opinion,
that
should
determine
it.
it
seems
to
me
to
be
the
workable
solution
to
the
problem.
mr.
donald
g.
peterson
well,
i
think
that
the
sixth
circuit,
justice
stevens,
in
hutto
v.
finney
would
stand
for
that
proposition,
yes.
and
sensitive
to
that,
the
practicalities.
my
client
can
not
afford
to
make
a
$100,000
offer
and
then
expose
itself
to
a
fee
on
top
of
that.
that
is
why
our
offer
was
made
the
way
it
was.
mr.
donald
g.
peterson
it
is
a
clearcut
offer.
mr.
donald
g.
peterson
i
would
have
to
at
that
point,
as
a
practical
matter,
have
to
guess
not
one
thing
but
two
things.
i
would
have
to
not
only
guess
what
the
jury
was
going
to
do,
but
i'd
also
have
to
guess
what
the
trial
court
might
do
with
the
fee.
mr.
donald
g.
peterson
oh,
i
don't
think
this
court
has
to
guess
because
this
court
isn't
going
to
see
the
case
until
there's
been
an
adjudication
on
the
fee.
if
someone
wants
to
make
an
offer
that
doesn't
include
a
fee--
mr.
donald
g.
peterson
--not
in
this
record,
you
don't.
mr.
donald
g.
peterson
it
sure
was.
the
joint
appendix.
you'll
see
in
the
joint
appendix
a
reprint
of
the
offer.
mr.
donald
g.
peterson
the
pertinent
language
there
is:
"for
a
sum",...
that
is
an
adjective
phrase,
if
recall
my
grammar
in
grade
school...
"a
sum,
including
costs
now
accrued
and
attorney's
fees.
"
--those
are
the
two
things
that
are
within
the
comma...
100,000>
["].
the
sum
is
qualified
by
the
phrase
"costs
now
accrued
and
attorney's
fees.
"
it
covers
both
components.
it
is
an
attempt,
and
i
think
a
successful
attempt,
to
mirror
the
provision
of
the
rule.
mr.
donald
g.
peterson
is
it
settled?
no,
i
don't
think
it
is
settled
until
this
court
does
it.
i
do
not
think
that
issue
has
been
settled.
mr.
donald
g.
peterson
well--
mr.
donald
g.
peterson
--i
could...
i
believe
what
i
could
do,
justice
white,
is
make
the
offer
without
including
attorney's
fees
or,
as
you
put
it,
excluding
attorney's
fees...
i
think
it
means
the
same
thing...
and
if
i
had
done
that,
the
result
obtained
would
have
been
$60,000
compared
to
the
$100,000.
after
that
happened,
however,
now
we're
going
to
have
a
fee
hearing,
and
at
the
fee
hearing--
mr.
donald
g.
peterson
--you
compare
it
with
the
judgment
on
verdict.
mr.
donald
g.
peterson
it
would
not.
mr.
donald
g.
peterson
pay
it
now
or
pay
it
later,
i
guess
it
what
is
sometimes,
said
to
be.
but
if
you
don't
offer
it,
those
fees
now,
then
you
are
not...
you
are
entitled
to
do
that,
but
i
think
it
would
be
a
foolish
thing
for
you
to
do.
mr.
donald
g.
peterson
sure.
mr.
donald
g.
peterson
that's
correct.
mr.
donald
g.
peterson
any
way
you
want
to.
it's
not
unreasonable.
it's
done.
that
is
what
a
contingent
fee
always
does.
if
1988
didn't
exist,
if
this
was
a
straight
common
law
cause
of
action,
somebody
offers
you
$100,000,
they
don't
care
whether
the
attorney
gets
it
or
the
client
gets
it.
there
is
a
follow-up
question,
i
think,
that
comes
from
it.
doesn't
this
take
the
discretion
away
from
the
district
court,
which
it
should
have,
on
fees,
to
set
a
reasonable
fee?
i
think
the
body
of
federal
law
would
suggest
that
a
district
court
in
regulating
the
procedure
before
it
always
has
the
right
to
determine
those
fees.
and
i
don't
think
that
takes'
this
discretion
away
from
the
court.
what
i'm
suggesting
in
substance
and
in
conclusion
is
that
the
district
court
in
the
operation
of
rule
68
is
to,
to
borrow
the
expression
from
the
seventh
circuit,
to
mechanically
apply
rule
68.
the
district
court
need,
however,
not
apply
mechanically
the
amount.
the
district
court's
supposed
to
exercise
its
discretion
as
to
amount.
i
understand
that
it's
not
easy
to
be
successful
making
an
offer
of
judgment,
but
if
you
do
it
right,
shouldn't
you
get
affirmed?
mr.
donald
g.
peterson
we
did
in
our
post-trial
motion.
there
were
cross
post-trial
motions
and
we
did
present
these
and
the
district
court
denied
all
the
relief.
mr.
donald
g.
peterson
well,
as
i
understand
the
body
of
law
that's
developed
on
that
there
is
a
different
standard
for
the
defendant,
apparently,
under
1988.
mr.
donald
g.
peterson
it's
not
an
absolute
prohibition,
but
apparently
the
standard
under
the
body
of
law
that
this
court
has
developed
for
a
defendant
is
different
under
1988
than
it
is
for
the
plaintiff.
mr.
donald
g.
peterson
well,
because
the
attorney's
fee
component
has
to
come
from
somewhere,
justice
rehnquist.
rule
68
uses
the
broad
word
"costs".
in
some
contexts,
1988,
the
word
1988.
therefore,
the
specific...
that
is,
1988...
goes
into
the
general.
mr.
donald
g.
peterson
okay.
i'm
sorry.
i
see
your
point
now.
i
am
not
the
prevailing
party
under
1988.
i
appreciate
your
making
that
point.
i
cannot
use
1988
as
my
source
for
the
fee.
i
appreciate
your
straightening
me
out.
mr.
donald
g.
peterson
well,
i
think
rule
68
would
authorize,
in
this
set
of
facts,
my
recovery
of
costs,
1988.
my
answer
to
your
question
is
yes,
but
we
have
not
pursued
that.
it
is
a
nominal
amount,
in
the
first
instance,
and,
frankly,
i
don't
think
it
improves
our
standing
to
be
arguing
these
equities
to
be
going
after
those
little
things.
but
on
the
big
equities--
mr.
donald
g.
peterson
--yes.
i
think
that
68...
i
think
that
68
does
authorize
that
recovery.
mr.
donald
g.
peterson
conventional
costs
as
opposed
to
the
attorney's
fee
type
costs,
yes.
