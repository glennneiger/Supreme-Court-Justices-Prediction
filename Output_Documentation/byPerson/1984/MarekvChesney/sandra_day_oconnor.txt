justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
peterson,
under
rule
68
i
gather
that
a
prevailing
plaintiff
who
gets
a
judgment
less
favorable
than
the
defendant's
offered
judgment
has
to
pay
defendant's
costs
accrued
after
the
offer
of
settlement,
as
well
as
absorb
the
plaintiff's
own
costs
and
attorney's
fees.
now
did
you
try
to
recover
any
post-offer
costs
from
the
defendant
here?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
do
you
think
you
are
entitled
to
those
under
rule
68
in
your
version
of
it?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
would
you
think
1988
cuts
in
and
says
no,
you
can't
get
them?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
are
you
not
entitled
to
it
because
you're
not
the
prevailing
party
under
1988,
or
what?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
you
think
you
can
or
cannot
use
rule
68
to
get...
for
your
post-offer
costs?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
it
could
be
significant
and
certainly
we
would
have
to
have
that
in
mind,
i
suppose.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
if
that's
your
position,
then
you
would
disagree
with
the
response
given
to
me
by
mr.
peterson
in
my
question
to
him
about
the
recoverability
of
post-offer
costs
of
a
defendant.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
stone,
excuse
the
interruption,
but
just
to
clarify
for
my
benefit,
if
you
would,
we
have
attorney's
fees
being
requested
here
by
each
party,
in
effect.
how
much
in
the
way
of
attorney's
fees
was
being
requested
by
the
defendants
in
the
original
action
and
how
much
by
the
plaintiffs
in
the
original
action?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
the
$170,000
was
the
plaintiff's
requested
fees
and
costs?
justice
o'connor
now
was
it
disclosed,
am
i
correct,
late
in
the
picture
that
it
was
a
contingent
fee
arrangement?
justice
o'connor
well,
mr.
stone,
i
guess
there's
some
indication
that
congress
wanted
to
treat
fees
as
costs
so
that
they
could
be
shifted
to
recovery
against
cities
and
states
and
counties,
so
apparently
they
wanted
to
treat
them
as
costs,
at
least
for
that
purpose.
justice
o'connor
well,
i
guess
the
question
is
whether
that
purpose
is
enough
to
make
costs
mean
something
else
for
a
different
purpose.
