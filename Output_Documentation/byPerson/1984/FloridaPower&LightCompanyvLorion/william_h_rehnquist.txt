justice
rehnquist
mr.
rothfeld,
how
many
letters
of
the
kind
that
justice
stevens
was
asking
about
does
the
agency
get
in
a
month
or
a
year?
do
you
have
any
idea?
justice
rehnquist
why
would
the
agency
want
to
prevent
that
from
happening?
i
would
think,
you
know,
given,
you
know,
everyone
has
some
experience...
everyone
in
public
life
has
some
experience
with
citizen
letters,
but
given
the
receipt
of
200
letters
over
a
period
of
ten
years,
that
the
agency
would
want
kind
of
a
short
form
reply
to
some
people,
just
saying,
we
have
considered
what
you
have
to
say
and
there
is
nothing
to
it,
period.
what
would
be
wrong
with
that?
justice
rehnquist
mr.
hodder,
would
you
say
the
commission's
response
to
your
client's
letter
was
in
the
nature
of
saying
the
facts
you
allege
are
not
so,
or
that
even
if
the
facts
you
allege
are
all
true,
it
is
still
no
reason
for
concern
under
the
law?
justice
rehnquist
but
i
am
not
quite
sure
what
your
answer
to
my
question
is.
is
the
commission's
response
to
your
client's
letter
essentially
that
as
a
matter
of
fact,
you
are
wrong,
or
as
a
matter
of
law,
you
are
wrong?
justice
rehnquist
so
you
say
you
should
have
a
hearing
because
you
have
made
allegations
of
fact
that
if
you
could
support
them
would
be
legally
significant,
and
the
commission
has
just
chosen
to,
what,
disregard
those
allegations
of
fact?
justice
rehnquist
is
that
normal
for
a
case
to
come
from
an
agency
to
a
court
of
appeals,
and
then
for
the
court
of
appeals
to
remand
the
case
to
the
district
court?
justice
rehnquist
i
thought
you
said--
justice
rehnquist
--will
you
answer
my
question?
justice
rehnquist
i
thought
you
said
that
the
hobbs
act
required
that
result
just
now.
justice
rehnquist
i
thought
you
said
that
the
hobbs
act
required
the
result
that
a
case
coming
from
an
agency
to
the
court
of
appeals
should
be
remanded
to
the
district
court.
justice
rehnquist
you
would
be
seeking
in
the
district
court.
wouldn't
you
review
under
the
administrative
procedure
act?
justice
rehnquist
the
hobbs
act?
the
hobbs
act
isn't
the
same
thing
as
the
administrative
procedures
act.
justice
rehnquist
under
the
administrative
procedures
act,
the
district
court
can
reopen
on
its
own.
can
it
take
testimony?
justice
rehnquist
couldn't
it
take
testimony
itself,
though,
under
the
apa?
justice
rehnquist
but
your
opponent
disagrees.
at
least
i
thought
in
answer
to
a
colloquy
he
thought
that
there
were
factual
issues
in
the
case.
