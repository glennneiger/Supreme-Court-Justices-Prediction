mr.
harold
f.
reis
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
i
would
like
to
emphasize
at
the
outset
that
in
deciding
this
case,
the
court
below
gave
no
consideration
whatsoever
to
the
relationship
of
the
judicial
review
provision
in
the
atomic
energy
act,
section
189,
the
section
we
are
dealing
with
now,
to
the
overall
scheme
of
regulation
which
the
act
put
into
effect.
now,
whether
they
didn't
do
it
because
they
did
not
permit
briefing
of
the
issue,
and
whether
they
simply
overlooked
it,
or
whether
they
considered
the
matter
not
to
be
relevant,
i
of
course
do
not
know,
because
they
simply
didn't
consider
it
at
all.
i
submit,
however,
that
however
lacking
in
neatness
the
language
of
section
189
is,
that
this
is
a
very
important
matter
to
be
considered
in
interpreting
the
section.
now,
a
very
important,
if
not
the
most
important
objective
of
the
atomic
energy
act
of
1954
was
to
make
it
possible
for
the
first
time
for
private
ownership
and
operation
of
nuclear
power
reactors,
and
the
most
important...
that
private
ownership
and
operation
was
the
course
to
be
made
subject
to
a
very
close
type
of
regulation,
and
perhaps
the
most
important
instrument
of
such
regulation
was
licensing.
the
act
made
it
a
crime
to
own
or
operate
a
nuclear
reactor
without
a
license,
and
provided
elaborate
provisions
in
section
189
for
how
licenses
were
to
be
issued
and
provide
for
their
revocation.
viewed
from
this
point
of
view,
what
you
had
was
an
act
which
was
creating
a
large
national
administrative
system
in
which
licensing
was
key.
section
189
therefore
provided
that
in
any
proceeding
respecting
the
issuance,
amendment,
or
suspension
of
a
license
there
would
be
court
of
appeals
review.
this,
of
course,
was
wholly
consistent
with
this
idea
of
a
national
system
of
regulation
in
which
licensing
was
key.
it
provided
for
judicial
review
of
any
proceeding,
and
it
did
not
necessarily
turn,
as
courts
which
have
considered
the
question
before,
for
example,
d.c.
circuit,
when
it
first
considered
this
question,
it
made
it
applicable
to
proceedings
relating
to
licenses
at
any
stage.
accordingly,
earlier,
this,
the
d.c.
circuit
determined
that
consideration
of
the
jurisdiction
of
the
question
whether
enforcement
or
licensing
action
should
be
undertaken
was
the
first
stage
of
a
proceeding
of
the
type
that
section
189
expressly
conferred
authority
on
the
courts
of
appeals
to
review.
mr.
harold
f.
reis
i
think
the
answer
is,
it
is
related
to
it,
and
i
would
like
to
explain
why,
if
i
may.
mr.
harold
f.
reis
related
to
it.
well,
if
i
explain
the
relationship,
i
think
i
may
answer
it
best,
if
i
may.
what
happened
was,
the
letter
asked
that
the
turkey
point
unit
be
shut
down
immediately.
it
asked
that...
i
believe
i
am
quoting
it,
but
it
was
pretty
close
to
that...
be
shut--
mr.
harold
f.
reis
--the
letter
asked
that
the
turkey
point
unit
be
shut
down
immediately,
that
consideration
be
promptly
given
to
suspension
of
the
license,
and
the
director's
response
to
that
request
was,
as
the
respondent
herself
characterizes
it
in
her
brief,
at
page
2,
i
believe,
as
prompt.
what
he
did
was
amass
the
existing
material
relating
to
the
matter.
he
went
to
the
material
publicly
at
hand
within
the
commission,
and
if
you
look
at
the
record
in
this
case,
what
you
will
find
is,
there
were
not,
for
example,
submissions
in
response
to
this
thing,
to
this
letter,
as
respondent
suggests.
we,
for
example,
florida
power
and
light,
the
licensee,
did
not
file
a
response.
it
was
not
because
we
didn't
know
it
was
there,
but
because
we
thought
that
the
material
was
available
to
the
director.
if
you
look
at
his
decision,
he
looked
at
material
relating
to
the
two
technical
questions,
steam
generators
and
pressurized
thermal
shock,
amassed
them,
saw,
appraised
the
nature
of
the
supposed
threat,
put
this
together
in
a
coherent
opinion.
in
effect,
he
gave
ms.
lorion
exactly
the
response
she
had
asked
for.
that
is,
he
gave
immediate
consideration
to
it,
and
then,
on
the
basis
of
the
existing
technical
material,
some
of
which
had
been
previously
submitted
by
us,
some
of
which
had
been
previously
prepared
by
the
nrc
staff
which
was
dealing
with
this
technical
problem.
he
advised
ms.
lorion
why
he
was
not
going
to
take
the
action
she
wanted.
now,
i
think
i
have
answered
your
question,
mr.
justice.
mr.
harold
f.
reis
that
is
correct.
we
didn't
file
briefs,
she
didn't
file
another
brief,
and
so
on.
nevertheless,
it
can
still
be
regarded
as
a
proceeding.
rulemaking,
for
example,
is
very
frequently
based
upon
comments,
technical
information,
and
that
kind
of
material.
mr.
harold
f.
reis
under
the...
i
think
the
answer
is
that
if
there
was
a
process,
that
it
would
be
reviewable.
you
might
have
difficulties
in
reviewing
it
without
a
record,
as
with
the
district
court,
since
the
standard
is
arbitrary
and
capricious.
so
far
in
the
seven
or
eight
cases
which
have
been
decided,
which
have
gotten
to
the
courts,
the
records
have
been
adequate
for
judicial
review.
no
court--
mr.
harold
f.
reis
--precisely.
and
they
could
be
sent,
remanded
for
the
creation,
the
establishment
of
a
better
record,
or
they
could
be
reversed
if
it
was
on
its
face
arbitrary
and
capricious,
but--
mr.
harold
f.
reis
--i
think
so,
and
there
are
a
number
of
other--
mr.
harold
f.
reis
--questions
that
indicate
that
the
court
is
somewhat
puzzled
as
to
why
the
commission
didn't
do
it,
and
i
can't
speak
for
the
commission,
but
i
think
that
mr.
rothfeld
has
suggested
the
answer,
and
that
is
that
as
long
as
there
is
this
kind
of
public
concern
for
the
use
of
atomic
energy,
and
as
long
as
the
commission
feels
it
is
able
to
handle
the
matter
in
this
way
by
giving
serious
consideration
to
requests,
not
matter
how
frivolous,
then
it
is
doing
it
this
way.
it
may
have
to
change.
mr.
harold
f.
reis
yes,
sir,
it
certainly
could.
mr.
harold
f.
reis
yes.
and
i
might
say
that
in
putting
that
together
in
one
package
and
making
it
clear
why
it
was
doing
what
it
was
doing,
and
what
it
was
taking
into
consideration,
it
was
making
it
possible
for
the
court
of
appeals
to
review
the
matter.
it
was
not
one
of
these
situations
in
which
they
said,
no,
this
is
silly,
we
are
not
going
to
do
it.
we
know
better
than
you.
mr.
harold
f.
reis
no,
because
it
found
that
it
had
no
jurisdiction
to
handle
the
matter.
mr.
harold
f.
reis
thank
you.
