mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
this
case
presents
one
narrow
issue,
whether
the
word
189
of
the
atomic
energy
act
to
refer
to
all
proceedings
or
only
to
certain
types
of
formal
agency
proceedings.
this
case
began
when
the
respondents
sent
a
letter
to
the
nuclear
regulatory
commission
asking
the
commission
to
suspend
the
license
of
the
florida
power
and
light
company's
turkey
point
nuclear
plant.
under
the
commission's
procedures,
such
a
so-called
section
2.206
request
from
the
public
must
be
evaluated
by
the
commission
staff.
if
the
request
is
found
to
present
a
substantial
health
or
safety
concern,
the
commission
will
issue
an
order
to
the
operator
of
the
plant
asking
it
to
show
cause
why
its
license
should
not
be
suspended,
modified,
or
revoked.
here,
the
commission
staff
evaluated
respondent's
request,
in
the
process
compiling
a
547-page
record.
on
the
basis
of
this
record,
the
director
of
the
commission's
office
of
nuclear
reactor
regulation
concluded
that
respondent's
request
did
not
raise
a
substantial
health
or
safety
concern,
and
be
therefore
issued
an
opinion
declining
to
take
action
against
the
plant.
respondent
then
challenged
this
decision
in
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
circuit,
but
that
court
decided
that
it
lacked
jurisdiction
to
hear
the
case.
the
court
based
its
decision
on
the
language
and
the
two-part
structure
of
section
189.
section
189(a)
provides
for
hearings
in
proceedings
relating
to
the
licensing
of
nuclear
plants
that
are
held
before
the
commission.
section
189(b)
then
makes
provision
for
review
in
courts
of
appeals
of
all
orders
entered
during
the
course
of
proceedings
of
the
kind
described
in
section
189(a).
here,
the
court
of
appeals
read
the
word
189(a)
to
refer
only
to
formal
agency
action,
and
it
therefore
concluded
that
the
types
of
orders
made
reviewable
in
the
court
of
appeals
under
section
18(b)
are
only
orders
entered
during
the
course
of
such
formal
proceedings.
the
court
therefore
concluded
that
challenges
to
the
denial
of
section
2.206
requests
had
to
be
reviewed
under
an
abuse
of
discretion
standard
first
in
the
district
court
with
the
decision
of
those
courts
in
turn
made
reviewable
in
courts
of
appeals.
this
system
of
judicial
review
devised
by
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case,
which
departs
from
the
practice
followed
in
several
of
the
circuits,
finds
no
support
in
the
statutory
language
or
legislative
history,
and
advances
no
identifiable
interest
to
the
public.
if
the
court
of
appeals
believed
that
the
word
"proceeding"
generally
applies
only
to
formal
agency
action,
it
plainly
was
mistaken.
the
administrative
procedure
act,
which
is
incorporated
by
reference
into
the
atomic
energy
act,
and
therefore
should
control
in
this
case,
defines
the
term
"agency
proceedings"
to
include
a
wide
range
of
agency
action,
formal
and
informal.
among
other
things,
agency
proceedings
under
the
apa
include
all
agency
process
respecting
the
grant,
denial,
or
modification
of
a
license.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
justice
stevens,
we
believe
that
there
was
such
a
proceeding.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
yes.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
we
believe
that
the
agency
had
discretion
to
dispense
with
the
hearing
if
one
was
unnecessary,
as
it
was
in
this
case.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
well,
this
court
repeatedly
has
indicated
that
statutes
that
create
hearing
rights
implicitly
contain
the
understanding
that
administering
agencies
can
dispense
with
the
hearing
if
one
is
unnecessary,
or
when
the
person
seeking
the
hearing
fails
to
advance
any
issue
that
a
hearing
might
help
resolve.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
i
think,
as
this
court
has
indicated,
"shall"
should
be
read
to
contain
the
understanding
that
congress
didn't
want
agencies
to
conduct
meaningless
hearings,
and
i
think
that
that...
the
types
of
cases
that
have
raised
this
issue
really
make
that
clear.
i
don't
think
there's
any
doubt
that
in
a
case
such
as
nrdc
versus
nrc,
decided
by
the
district
of
columbia
circuit,
where
the
nrc
concluded
that
it
lacked
jurisdiction
to
consider
the
complaint,
there
would
have
been
no
point
in
holding
a
hearing.
it
seems
ridiculous
that
congress
would
have
insisted
that
one
be
held.
or,
in
a
case
where
the
person
demanding
a
hearing
wants
to
raise
issues
that
are
outside
the
scope
of
the
proceeding,
it
would
make
little
sense
to
insist
that--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--i
wouldn't
say
there
is
no
support
in
the
statutory
language.
we
acknowledge,
i
believe,
that
the
statute
can
be
read
as...
we
think
that
is
a
strained
interpretation
of
the
statute.
i
think
that
is
made...
in
part
is
made
clear
by
the
administrative
procedures
act.
the
use
of
the
word
"proceedings"
refers
to
a
wide
range
of
informal
agency
actions.
it
is
also
made
clear
by
the
hobbs
act,
which
provides
the
vehicle
for
judicial
review
in
this
case,
the
use
of
the
word
"proceeding"
to
refer
to
informal
agency
action,
and
that,
the
hobbs
act
specifically
provides
for
review
in
courts
of
appeals
of
proceedings
in
which
hearings
have
not
been
held.
the
court
of
appeals,
as
your
question
suggested,
based
its
decision
on
a
semantic
approach
to
the
language
of
section
189.
it
entirely
ignored
the
apa
and
the
hobbs
act,
and
instead
noted
that
section
189(a)
provides
the
hearing
shall
be
held
in
proceedings
which
raise
licensing
related
issues
before
the
commission.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
absolutely.
the
argument
that
respondent
made
in
the
court
of
appeals
was
precisely
that,
that
a
hearing
should
have
been
held
in
this
case,
and
that
on
remand
is
the
type
of
issue
that
respondent
is
free
to
argue
with.
the
commission
abused
its
discretion
in
refusing
to
hold
it.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
yes,
that
is
our
position.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
that's
true.
every
letter
in
fact
initiates
a
fairly
formal
agency
process
in
response.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
technically,
i
think
that
would
be
a
proceeding
within
the
meaning
of
the
apa
and
hobbs
act,
but
that
will
never
occur,
because
the
agency
had
obligated
itself
in
section
2.206
to
respond
in
detail
to
all
the
factual
allegations
or
complaints
presented
in
letters
to
the
agency,
and
to
issue
a
formal
opinion
articulating
its
rationale
and
addressing
those
points
in
detail
if
it
declines
to
take
further
action.
so,
those
are
fairly
elaborate
agency
processes
which
lead
to
the
disposition
of
licensing
related
matters,
which
is
the
apa--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--my
understanding
is
that
in
the
past
ten
years...
this
process
began
with
the
promulgation
of
section
2.206
in
1974.
in
that
ten-year
period
the
agency
has
received
about
200
letters.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
well,
under
the
agency
procedure,
it
has
obligated
itself
to
respond
to
each
of
these
in
detail.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
i
think
it
could.
in
fact,
before
the
promulgation
of
section
2.206,
there
was
no
qualification
on
the
agency
to
respond
in
detail.
but
i
think
any
time
the
agency's
case
to
disclose
a
matter
related
to
licensing
is
prevented,
too,
if
that
is
in
fact
the
procedure.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
well,
presumably
it
would
be
challenged
in
some
court,
if
not
in
the
court
of
appeals.
an
action
could
be
commenced
in
the
district
court
and
then
brought
to
the
court
of
appeals
to
compel
the
agency
and
to
argue
the
agency's
views
and
its
discretion
to
take
action.
so
the
only
question
here
is
whether
or
not
the
agency's
disposal
of
these
licensing
related
issues--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--it
varies
from
year
to
year,
justice
powell,
but
i
think
in
a
typical
year
it
ranges
from
ten
to
thirty.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
if
a
tremendous
number
of
letters
were
presented,
it
would
present
a
burden
for
the
agency's...
but
the
agency
has
obligated
itself
to
do
so,
and
congress
has
obligated
the
courts
to
do
so.
there
is
really
no
way
around
it.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
that's
true.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
that
is
true,
justice
white,
and
that,
in
fact,
is
one
of
the
problems
with
the
court
of
appeals
analysis.
it
simply
would
double
the
burden
of
the
courts
by
making
every
one
of
these
actions
reviewable
first
in
the
district
court
under
an
abuse
of
discretion
standard,
and
then
the
same
record
would
be
reviewed
in
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
justice
o'connor,
the
agency
has
taken
action
to
assure
that
in
every
one
of
these
cases
there
will
be
an
adequate
record.
the
person
filing
the
section
2.206
request
is
always
free
to
submit
whatever
factual
material
or
legal
arguments
he
or
she
thinks
will
support
their
claim.
the
agency
has
then
obligated
itself
by
its
decisions
and
in
section
2.206
to
address
those
facts
in
detail
and
to
write
an
opinion
articulating
its
reasons
if
section
2.206--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--well,
in
this
case,
respondent
originally
sent
a
brief
letter.
respondent
was
free
initially
to
submit
whatever
she
wished
in
this
case,
and
is
free
to
submit
another
section
2.206
request
presenting
factual
material
that
she
believes
the
agency
should
have
considered
but
didn't
consider.
no
one
is
foreclosed
from
presenting
such
material,
and
this
case
demonstrates--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--that
issue
was
never
decided
by
the
court
of
appeals.
the
court
simply
dismissed
the
case
for
lack
of
jurisdiction,
and
on
remand
that
is
the
type
of
issue
that
should
be
addressed.
absolutely,
justice
white.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
i
can't
speak
to
every
one
of
these
letters
in
years
past.
this
case
certainly
received
a
number
and
was
treated
as
a
proceeding.
a
docket
was
created
containing
files
submitted
by
the
agency,
and
my
understanding
is
that
when
each
of
these
things
comes
in,
because
the
agency
has
obligated
itself
to
address
the
facts,
to
issue
an
opinion,
everyone
is
treated
as
an
independent
proceeding
in
which
a
record
of
that
sort
is
created.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
i
am
not
aware
that
the
agency
has
done
that,
justice
marshall.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
i
haven't
seen
this
agency
do
it
in
this
context.
and
the
agency's
rules
are
designed
to
prevent
that
from
happening
by
obligating
the
agency
to
explain
its
rationale.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
we
don't
submit
that
there
would
be
anything
wrong
with
that,
but
the
commission
in
the
exercise
of
its
discretion
has
decided
that
given
the
magnitude
of
the
safety
issues
involved
it
would
treat
these
things
seriously,
and
will
address
each
one
in
some
detail.
we
certainly
don't
suggest
that
the
atomic
energy
act
obligates
them
to
do
this,
and
the
agency,
as
i
said,
began
doing
this
ten
years
ago.
presumably
if
these
things
began
to
create
a
tremendous
burden
on
the
agency's
resources,
it
would
be
free
to
change
its
procedures
to
address
that.
and
to
respond
just
a
little
bit
more
fully
to
justice
o'connor's
question.
in
this
case,
there
was
a
547-page
record
containing
the
materials
that--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--well,
i
think
there
is,
because
the
agency
has
obligated
itself
to
articulate
its
rationale
and
explain
the
basis
upon
which
it--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--section
2.206
itself
obligates
the
agency
to
do
that,
and
that
will
lead
to
the
type
of
record
that
the
courts
of
appeals
regularly
review
in
cases
of
informal
adjudication
and
rulemaking.
so
long
as
the
agency
has
articulated
its
rationale
in
an
intelligent
way--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--yes.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
i
think
the
agency
has
used
the
term
"proceeding"
to
mean
different
things
in
different
contexts.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
in
the
regulation
itself,
it
does
not.
but
in
the
agency's--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--nor
in
the
statute.
well,
we
suggest
the
statute
uses
the
term
apa
and
the
hobbs
act,
both
of
which
were
incorporated
into
the
statute.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
the
agency
orders
interpreting
the
regulation
have
used
the
term
2.206
request
as
proceeding,
as
we
point
out
in
our
reply
brief,
it
has
also
referred
to
section
2.206
requests
as
requests
to
institute
show
cause
proceedings
or
enforcement
proceedings
or
informal
proceedings,
but
i
don't
think
the
agency
intended
to
interpret
the
word
189(a).
in
fact,
the
agency
consistently
has
taken
the
position
that
denials
of
a
section
2.206
requests
are
appealable
to
the
courts
of
appeals,
therefore
are
necessarily
orders
entered
in
proceedings
of
the
kind
described
in
section
189(a).
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
yes,
it
did.
it
is
one
of
the
problems
created.
the
jurisdictional
point
was
never
addressed
in
the
briefs
by
the
parties,
and
the
opinion
actually
was
circulated
to
the
full
court
before
the
parties
had
an
opportunity
to
file
a
petition
for
rehearing
en
banc,
so
the
issues
were
never
really
fully
addressed
by
the
court.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i
will
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time.
thank
you.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
yes,
three
quick
points,
your
honor.
first,
in
response
to
justice
stevens'
question,
the
government
has
not
conceded
any
of
respondent's
points.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
the
commission
might
very
well
take
that
position,
and
certainly
if
there
were
district
court
proceedings,
they
would
proceed
on
the
record
that
is
in
existence.
i
think
this
court
has
repeatedly
indicated
that
whatever
court
is
reviewing
agency
actions,
it
would
proceed
on
the
record
that
exists,
and
it
would
not...
the
district
court
would
not
be
free
to
create
a
record
of
its
own.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
i
think
so
long
as
the
record
is
adequate
to
support
the
decision
of
the
agency,
the
court
would
have
to
review
that
record.
if
it
concluded
that
the
record
was
inadequate
to
support
the
agency
conclusions,
it
could
remand
to
the
agency
for
further
proceedings.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
i
am
not
sure
if
it
could,
your
honor.
to
the
extent
that
the
record
in
this
case
is
inadequate
in
some
way,
it
would
be
open
to
whichever
court
reviewed
it,
presumably
the
court
of
appeals,
to
send
it
back
to
the
agency.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
arbitrary
and
capricious,
i
would
think,
because
a
hearing
has
not
been
held,
and
the
atomic
energy
act
does
not
require
a
hearing
on
the
record.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
well,
it
is
not
clear,
as
the
court
of
appeals
noted,
it
is
not
clear
precisely
what
jurisdictional
statute
respondent
could
proceed
under.
the
court
of
appeals
suggested
general
federal
question
statute
or--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--well,
i
think
it
is
arguable
to
proceed
on
one
of
those
other
statutes,
but
the
government
has
not
conceded
that
it
could,
or
that
it
would
be
appropriate
in
district
court
in
any
event.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
if
i
were
the
respondent,
i
would
point
to
one
of
the
statutes
that
were
noted
in
the
court
of
appeals
opinion,
section
1331,
1337.
but
again,
that
would
be
as
the
respondent,
and
i
am
not
sure
the
commission
would
agree.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
finally,
i
think
that
if
the
court
of
appeals
were
to
review
this
case
and
decided
the
record
was
inadequate,
there
would
be
no
bar
in
the
hobbs
act
to
a
remand
to
the
agency.
the
hobbs
act
provides
for
transfers
to
the
district
court
only
when
genuine
issues
of
material
fact
are
presented,
and
in
this
case
there
are
no
factual
issues.
the
question
is
whether
the
agency
has
properly
based
its
decision
on
the
record
before.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
he
presented
factual
submissions
to
the
agency,
but
the
question
for
the
court
to
decide
is
whether
the
determination
that
the
agency
made
is
appropriately
based
on
the
record.
the
court...
i
think
as
this
court
has
indicated
repeatedly
in
cases
like
overton
park
and
kemp
versus
phipps,
it
is
not
up
to
the
court
to
resolve
these
factual
issues.
the
court
can
only
review
the
accuracy
of
the
agency's
action.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
well,
respondent
certainly
had
an
opportunity
to
present
whatever
factual
material
she
wished,
and
may
present
whatever
factual
material
she
has
not
presented
to
this
point.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
only
if
it
is
a
case
of
formal
adjudication
or
formal
rulemaking.
in
many
instances,
of
informal
adjudication
or
rulemaking,
there
are
no
hearings.
the
agency
simply
proceeds
on
whatever
is
submitted
to
it
by
both
sides.
and
in
this
case,
the
respondent
or
someone
in
her
position
has
an
opportunity
to
submit
whatever
factual
materials
he
or
she
would
like
considered.
thank
you.
