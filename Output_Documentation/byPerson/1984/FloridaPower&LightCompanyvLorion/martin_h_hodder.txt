mr.
martin
h.
hodder
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
ms.
lorion
has
alleged
essentially
there
is
a
ticking
nuclear
time
bomb
in
her
back
yard.
the
commission
has
admitted
that
reactor
pressure
vessel
embrittlement
is
a
serious
and
unresolved
safety
issue,
but
it
has
declined
to
implement
a
hearing
in
which
to
consider
her
concerns.
the
utility
denies
the
problem
is
severe.
the
question
before
the
court
is,
where
is
that
factual
dispute
to
be
resolved?
mr.
martin
h.
hodder
yes,
your
honor.
she--
mr.
martin
h.
hodder
--brought
an
appeal
before
the
court
of
appeals
because
it
was
her
belief
based
on
the
existing
seven
or
eight
cases
that
that
was
the
appropriate
path
on
appeal,
having
been
denied
the
relief
she
sought
by
the
director's
decisions,
which
were
then
known
as
director's
denials.
mr.
martin
h.
hodder
i
don't
follow
that
observation.
mr.
martin
h.
hodder
we
were
overjoyed
to
find
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
that
jurisdiction
lay
in
the
district
court,
because
one
of
our
major
concerns
in
this
case
and
the
first
consideration
or
challenge
is
that
there
has
been
an
abuse
of
agency
discretion
on
the
part
of
the
commission.
we
have
just
considered
here
this
morning
the
version
of
the
government
and
the
agency
on
formulation
of
the
existing
record,
but
the
fact
is
that
the
record
that
was
assembled
was
selective
and
ex
parte
in
nature,
and
because
no
opportunity
was
given
to
my
client
to
participate,
she
did
not
participate
in
formulation
of
the
record.
indeed,
by
definition
of
the
2.206
process,
by
its
very
nature,
one
cannot
participate
if
one
is
a
petitioner
or
a
requester.
mr.
martin
h.
hodder
it
was
our
request--
mr.
martin
h.
hodder
--yes,
we--
mr.
martin
h.
hodder
--my
client,
of
course,
seeks
that
opportunity,
and
one
of
the--
mr.
martin
h.
hodder
--the
government
has
argued
that
one
could
renew
the
request
in
a
new
and
separate
2.206
request,
but
that
would
require
new
information
not
previously
submitted.
since
the
decision
was
made
on
the
basis
of
the
issue
we
wish
to
be
heard,
we
are
unable
on
that
particular
issue,
which
is
reactor
pressure
vessel
embrittlement,
to
resubmit
the
question
in
a
way
that
it
could
be
considered
new.
therefore,
we
persist
on
our
request
that
there
be
an
enforcement
proceeding
or
a
hearing
on
the
substantial
issue
of
material
fact
that
we
have
raised,
because
the
issue
raised
here
is
acknowledged
to
constitute
an
unresolved
safety
issue,
and
the
record
relied
upon
the
commission
in
denying
the
relief
sought
is
incomplete.
and
the
commission
itself
shared
the
concerns
of
ms.
lorion,
and
i
believe
it
is
item
21
in
the
joint
appendix
in
the
case
below.
the
commission
used
another
show
cause
device
similar
to
the
2.202
show
cause
process
that
my
client
sought,
but
without
the
teeth
in
it,
and
without
the
requirement
of
a
hearing.
in
other
words,
the
commission
had
requested
information
on
august
21st
from
the
utility
noting
that
the
turkey
point
reactors
were
in
a
site
specific
category
which
was
causing
them
to
reach
levels
of
concern.
these
reactors--
mr.
martin
h.
hodder
--i
think
the
commission
fairly
addressed
the
question.
i
don't
think
they
denied
the
issue
that
there
existed
a
problem,
but
the
question
is
before
this
court
and
before
the
director
at
the
time
the
request
was
made,
is
how
much
information
did
the
commission
utilize
in
reaching
their
decision.
you
see,
you
cannot
not
find
that
there
is
an
abuse
of
discretion,
because
the
50.54
request
for
information
under
a
show
cause
request
under
the
commission's
other
rule
hadn't
been
answered
by
the
utility
at
the
time
they
issued
their
decision
in
this
case.
mr.
martin
h.
hodder
i
think
that
as
a
matter
of
fact,
of
course,
is
the
response.
mr.
martin
h.
hodder
of
course.
we
raised
an
issue
of
material
fact
that
we
seek
to
litigate,
and
the
commission
disagrees
with
us.
mr.
martin
h.
hodder
of
course,
i
think
that
that
is
the
basis
for
the
definition
of
the
rule.
it
is
my
belief
that
the--
mr.
martin
h.
hodder
--i
think
that
it
is
a
reasonable
interpretation
of
the
statute,
and
the
client
has
made
such
a
showing.
the
agency,
on
the
other
hand,
hasn't
been
able
to
show
otherwise,
because
they
answered
before
they
had
all
the
information
in.
you
have
to
understand
that
in
review
of
the
record
that
the
agency
did
assemble,
which
was
fortuitously
complete
in
some
respects,
the
turkey
point
reactors,
unlike
other
reactors
in
the
united
states,
fell
into
a
worst
case
category.
they,
having
been
designed
in
the
late
sixties,
early
seventies,
had
engineering
flaws
designed
into
them
that
weren't
apparent
at
the
time,
like
pinto
automobiles
with
their
bad
gas
tanks,
because
as
the
copper
which
inadvertently
was
introduced
into
the
reactor
pressure
vessel
began
to
cause
embrittlement,
it
became
apparent
to
everyone
at
the
commission
and
members
of
the
public
as
well
that
these
particular
reactors,
eight
in
all,
the
turkey
point
ones
being
the
worst
in
the
category,
subcategory,
worst
subcategory
of
the
total
of
eight,
were
so
bad
that
the
commission
itself
saw
fit
to
request
this
additional
information
from
the
utility
company.
the
utility
company
had
not
responded
at
the
time
the
director
denied
the
relief
ms.
lorion
sought.
i
say
that
that
is
an
inadequate
basis
for
refusal
to
act,
and
that
therefore
he
abused
his
discretion.
ancillary
to
that
is
the
next
issue
of
whether
or
not
ms.
lorion's
contentions
are
correct
or
not.
mr.
martin
h.
hodder
when
we
went
to
the
court
of
appeals--
mr.
martin
h.
hodder
--of
course,
we
felt
that
the--
mr.
martin
h.
hodder
--director
abused
his
discretion
by
not
implementing
a
hearing
under
2.202.
mr.
martin
h.
hodder
if
we
go
into
district
court,
we
would
seek
to
utilize
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure
and
examine
in
that
court
the
existing
record's
adequacy
by
presentation
of
evidence
and--
mr.
martin
h.
hodder
--no,
sir.
no.
we
would--
mr.
martin
h.
hodder
--we
feel
that
based
on
interpretation
of
the
law
and
the
nature
of
the
2.206--
mr.
martin
h.
hodder
--that's
true.
mr.
martin
h.
hodder
of
course.
that
is
the
first
consideration
that
that
court
would--
mr.
martin
h.
hodder
--of
course.
mr.
martin
h.
hodder
of
course.
i
understand
that.
and
of
course
we
should
also
take
note
of
the
fact
that
were
we
to
find
jurisdiction
in
the
court
of
appeals
initially
in
this
case,
the
hobbs
act
would
require
that
the
case
be
remanded
to
the
district
court
in
any
event,
because
it
fits
the
definition
under
2347(b)(3)
that
requires--
mr.
martin
h.
hodder
--well,
that
is
the
result
we
are
trying
to
avoid
this
morning.
mr.
martin
h.
hodder
because
that
would
impose
an
extra
tier
of
review
which--
mr.
martin
h.
hodder
--yes,
sir.
mr.
martin
h.
hodder
i
didn't
hear
you,
sir.
mr.
martin
h.
hodder
by
examination
of
the
facts
in
this
case,
that
would
be
the
result
were
we
to
find
jurisdiction
in
the
court
of
appeals
and
then
apply
the
hobbs
act.
i
am
only
pointing
out
that
the
result
would
be
the
same
in
any
event
based
on
our
interpretation
of
the
atomic
energy
act
and
the
hobbs
act.
mr.
martin
h.
hodder
i
think
the
entire
atomic
energy
act
constitutes
a
very
serious
mandate
to
maintain
the
safety
of
the
nuclear
power
industry.
mr.
martin
h.
hodder
yes,
and
failure
to
observe
that
very
serious
mandate
constitutes
an
abuse
of
agency
discretion.
mr.
martin
h.
hodder
oh,
yes,
i
think
that
one
could
read
section
189(a)
of
the
act
to
show
that
parties
are
entitled
to
a
hearing
if
a
requester
seeks
one,
and
any
proceeding
for
the--
mr.
martin
h.
hodder
--yes,
sir.
that's
the
section.
mr.
martin
h.
hodder
yes,
i
claimed
at
the
court
of
appeals
level
that
the
record
constituted
denial
of
due
process
due
to
the
fact
of
a
selective
ex
parte--
mr.
martin
h.
hodder
--based
on
my
best
recollection
at
that
time,
i
felt
that...
i
believe
i
argued
that
it
should
be
remanded,
and
that
there
should
be
some
type
of
2.202
hearing
implemented.
that
is
my
best
recollection.
mr.
martin
h.
hodder
no,
because
then
we
would
win,
and
we
would...
that
is,
if
i
am
understanding
your
question,
and
you
were
to
remand
to
the
agency--
mr.
martin
h.
hodder
--of
course,
that
is
very
true,
but
we
must
concern
ourselves
when
we
remand
to
the
agency
with
the
effect
that
is
going
to
have
on
the
rule
and
the
previous
teaching
of
this
court
in
the
case
vermont
yankee,
because
if
we
don't
remand
to
the
agency
with
the
direct
proviso
that
they
implement
a
2.202
show
cause
proceeding,
which
is
what
we
are
seeking,
that
is,
if
anything
else
is
requested,
then
you
have
a
situation
where
a
court
of
appeals
is
tampering
with
the
procedure,
the
rule,
2.206,
established
by
the
agency
in
engrafting
its
own
notions
of
judicial
procedure
upon
that
agency
process,
which
is
exclusive
to
the
agency
and
which
the
courts
have
been
told
not
to
do.
in
other
words,
it
is
not
the
business
of
the
courts
of
appeals
to
amend
their
jurisdictional
grant.
mr.
martin
h.
hodder
well,
of
course--
mr.
martin
h.
hodder
--your
view
is
absolutely
correct
as
far
as
it
goes,
but
we
must
contemplate
the
nature
of
the
procedure
upon
remand,
whether
it
is
specifically
ordained
that
it
be
2.202
or
something
else.
because
of
the
nature
of
the
2.206
process,
and
its
definition
by
the
agency's
rule,
it
is
not
a
proceeding
under
189(a),
because
no
rights
as
a
party
attach
to
the
requester
under
2.206.
therefore,
if
we
mandate
that
the
director
take
the
decision
back
and
modify
it,
and
consider
this
requester's
views,
then
we
have
tampered
with
that
procedure
established
by
the
agency
for
entertaining
requests
for
enforcement
action.
if,
on
the
other
hand,
we
remand
to
the
agency
with
specific
instructions
that
there
was
an
abuse
of
discretion,
and
that
there
should
have
been
a
show
cause
proceeding
implemented,
then
that
would
be
a
good
result,
but
we
must
always
recognize
that
if
the
court
of
appeals
were
to
look
at
the
hobbs
act
and
its
provisions
under
2347(b),
it
could
in
the
alternative
remand
the
case
to
the
district
court.
mr.
martin
h.
hodder
yes,
and
that
result
would
please
us,
because
we
support
the
decision--
mr.
martin
h.
hodder
--it
would
be
our
view
that
upon
remand
to
the
district
court--
mr.
martin
h.
hodder
--transferred.
excuse
me.
i
am
misusing
the
word,
and
i
apologize.
mr.
martin
h.
hodder
upon
transfer
of
the
case
to
the
district
court,
then
the
rights
as
a
party
would
attach
for
the
first
time.
mr.
martin
h.
hodder
and
this
requester
would
then
have
or
proceed
under
the
rules,
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure,
and
shouldn't
be
able
to--
mr.
martin
h.
hodder
--to
examine
the
existing
record
and
to
present
evidence
and
testimony
and
cross
examination,
and
therefore
develop
a
record
that
adequately
and
fairly
represents
her
views,
which
was
not
the
record
established
by
the
director
below.
mr.
martin
h.
hodder
if
the
case
be
transferred,
yes.
mr.
martin
h.
hodder
my
presumption
is
that--
mr.
martin
h.
hodder
--well,
i
think
we
would
file
an
amended
complaint
at
that
point,
and
we
would
avail
ourselves
or
seek
to
avail
ourselves
of
discovery
rights,
and
then
proceed
under
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure,
and
yes,
there
would
be
pleadings.
mr.
martin
h.
hodder
not
under
the
definition
of
the
2.206
rule--
mr.
martin
h.
hodder
--because
for
the
first
time
here
the
rights
of
a
party
have
attached
because
we
raised
an
issue
of
material
fact
that
the
court
finds
worthy
of
consideration.
mr.
martin
h.
hodder
and
that
question,
of
course,
is
whether
or
not
it
is
safe
to
operate
this
plant
at
full
capacity,
or
whether
it
should
be
derated,
that
is,
reduced
to
the
lesser
capacity
for
safety
considerations,
or
perhaps
shut
down.
mr.
martin
h.
hodder
i
believe
that
under
the
general
jurisdiction
statutes
that
would
admit
us
to
the
district
court,
which
is
1331--
mr.
martin
h.
hodder
--i
believe
so.
i
believe
that--
mr.
martin
h.
hodder
--the
district
court
might
also
examine
the
question
of
abuse
of
discretion.
i
imagine
that
the
district
court
could
upon
transfer
remand
to
the
agency
for
a
2.202
proceeding
if
it
is
plowing
new
ground,
but
in
the
event
that
they
didn't
implement
that
remand,
then
we
would
be
entitled
as
a
party
under
1331
and
1337
to
proceed.
mr.
martin
h.
hodder
i
suspect
they
would,
your
honor.
mr.
martin
h.
hodder
yes,
there
is
a
case
known
as--
mr.
martin
h.
hodder
--a
case
where
we
have
transferred
to
the
district
court
and
then
the
rights
of
a
party
attach?
mr.
martin
h.
hodder
well,
the
question
is--
mr.
martin
h.
hodder
--the
question
is
how
one
perceives
the
original
request.
the
original
request
raised
an
issue
of
material
fact
which
might
be
adjudicated
in
an
adversary
proceeding
in
district
court.
that
is
our
contention.
but
there
is
another
issue
before
that,
and
that
is
whether
or
not
the
agency
has
committed
an
abuse
of
discretion
by
denying
the
relief
sought,
which
was
a
2.202
proceeding.
that
would
have
to
be
decided
first.
mr.
martin
h.
hodder
that
is
a
proceeding
where
hearing
rights
would
attach
and
an
interested
party
could
participate
under
2.202.
you
see,
the
2.206
process
is
the
threshold
request.
if
the
director
grants
the
request,
then
he
implements
under
the
2.202
rule
a
full
show
cause
proceeding
where
parties,
interested
parties
may
participate,
and
the
rights
of
a
party
then
attach.
mr.
martin
h.
hodder
we
are
not
seeking
a
de
novo
proceeding.
mr.
martin
h.
hodder
well,
i--
mr.
martin
h.
hodder
--no,
we
never
had
even
notice
that
the
director's
decision--
mr.
martin
h.
hodder
--in
a
sense,
your
honor.
mr.
martin
h.
hodder
we
could
go
into
district
court
on
a
new
case--
mr.
martin
h.
hodder
--on
future
director's
decisions,
that
would
be
the
result.
mr.
martin
h.
hodder
yes.
yes,
i
believe
that's
correct.
mr.
martin
h.
hodder
i
believe
that
we
could
raise,
yes,
a
bifurcated
argument
alleging
that
that
record
and
decision
constituted
abuse
of
discretion.
mr.
martin
h.
hodder
if
the
court
were
willing
to
entertain
an
amended
complaint
that
addressed
the
material
issue
of
fact
raised
by
the
requester
when
she
sought
the
initial
relief,
then
we
would
seek
to
litigate
that
de
novo.
mr.
martin
h.
hodder
the
administrative
procedure
act
would
control--
mr.
martin
h.
hodder
--no,
it
isn't.
mr.
martin
h.
hodder
it
is
a
jurisdictional
grant
contained
in
section
189(b).
mr.
martin
h.
hodder
in
other
words,
of
the
atomic
energy
act.
they
provide
under...
see,
first
they
define
the
proceeding
process,
then
they
give
the
jurisdiction
grant.
that
is
section
189(b).
and
that
is
the
hobbs
act.
and
if
you
read
the
hobbs
act,
2347(b)(3),
you
see
that
were
there
to
be
original
jurisdiction
in
the
court
of
appeals,
then
transfer
to
the
district
court
is
the
only
possible
result
on
our
reading
of
the
hobbs--
mr.
martin
h.
hodder
--contained
in
the
requester's
letter
requesting
enforcement
action--
mr.
martin
h.
hodder
--it
is
the
only
complaint
i
can
deal
with
here.
mr.
martin
h.
hodder
well,
of
course,
i--
mr.
martin
h.
hodder
--i
am
not
sure.
i
am
plowing
new
ground.
it
is
my
impression
that
i--
mr.
martin
h.
hodder
--i
think
that
we
would
file
a
petition
for
review
of
an
agency
order
in
the
district
court,
and
all
that
entails.
mr.
martin
h.
hodder
since
i
am
operating
under
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure,
i
believe
i
would
be
entitled
to
discovery.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
martin
h.
hodder
well,
this
court--
mr.
martin
h.
hodder
--this
court
did
not
grant
the
petition
for
cert
on
the
issue
of
whether
or
not
these
decisions
were
reviewable
at
all.
if
this
court
were
to
entertain
that
notion--
mr.
martin
h.
hodder
--i
am
following
your
argument
to
some
extent.
i
am
only
saying
that
this
court
hasn't
taken
up
that
issue,
that
there
is
a
narrow
jurisdictional
order
before
this
court,
and
were
this
court
to
seek
our
view
on
that
issue,
we
would
respectfully
ask
the
court
to
be
permitted
to
brief
that
issue
before
the
court
rules
that
such
decisions
are
not
reviewable
at
all.
certainly
as
a
practical
observation,
as
i
answered
you
earlier
today,
the
atomic
energy
act
taken
in
toto
doesn't
permit
such
an
abuse
of
discretion
that
would
cause
an
atomic
time
bomb
to
be
ticking
in
ms.
lorion's
back
yard
without
there
being
some
recourse
to
a
court
of
law
were
she
able
to
successfully
show
that
the
agency
has
abused
its
discretion.
mr.
martin
h.
hodder
that
is
true,
your
honor.
however,
i
think
that
there
is
a
vast
distinction
that
can
be
drawn
between
the
severity
of
these
issues
here
and
the
apa
issue
on,
i
think
it
is
706
of
the
apa
where
they
address
the
question
of
abuse
of
agency
discretion
and
do
make
it
reviewable.
i
feel
that
such
issues
are
reviewable.
i
would
only
say
that
i
have
tried
to
be
of
help
to
the
court
based
on
my
understanding
of
the
case.
i
would
say
to
this
court
that
if
you
seek
to
remand
the
case
to
the
agency,
that
you
be
careful
to
consider
my
suggestion
that
we
might
go
too
far
in
engrafting
the
court
of
appeals'
concepts
of
judicial
procedure
by
tampering
with
the
rule
established
by
the
agency,
that
is,
going
against
the
teachings
of
this
court
in
vermont
yankee.
and
i
thank
you
for
hearing
me
today.
