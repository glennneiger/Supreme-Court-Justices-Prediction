chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
court
will
hear
arguments
first
this
morning
in
florida
power
and
light
company
against
lorion
and
the
consolidated
case.
mr.
rothfeld,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
burger
let
me
ask
you
a
practical
question,
counsel.
in
the
commission,
i
assume,
as
in
most
courts,
when
a
matter
comes
in
that
is
categorized
as
a
proceeding
or
a
case,
it
is
given
a
number.
now,
you
mentioned
the
200
letters
over
a
period
of
ten
years,
i
think
it
was.
did
every
one
of
those
letters
get
a
number,
or
was
there
some
selection?
some
of
them
got
numbers
and
were
treated
as
a
proceeding,
and
some
didn't?
is
that
the
way
it
works?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
reis.
chief
justice
burger
the
commission's
brief,
mr.
reis,
tells
us
that
on
the
basis
of
a
547-page
record,
the
director
issued
a
decision
on
november
5th
denying
the
respondent's
request.
the
respondent's
request
had
been
filed
by
letter
on
september
11th,
1981.
now,
was
that
547-page
record
made
in
direct
response
to
the
september
11th
letter
of
the
respondent,
or
was
it
made
independent
of
that
but
in
some
way
related
to
it?
chief
justice
burger
related
to
it
but
independent?
chief
justice
burger
would
you
raise
your
voice
a
little,
mr.
reis?
chief
justice
burger
but
then
it
is
pretty
clear
that
that
547-page
record
was
not
put
together
in
any
kind
of
an
adversary
proceeding.
chief
justice
burger
if
the
court
of
appeals
on
receiving
a
file
of
the
kind
we
have
been
talking
about
with
virtually
nothing
in
it,
the
court
of
appeals,
courts
of
appeals
frequently
remand
a
case
for
the
development
of
an
appropriate
record,
and
that
could
be
done
here,
could
it
not?
chief
justice
burger
but
in
effect
what
your...
what
i
gather
your
response
earlier
was,
that
the
commission
had
this
problem
under
study
for
a
long
time
independent
of
the
papers
which
were
sent
on
september
11th
by
the
respondent,
and
it
simply
used
the
materials
it
had
on
this
subject
to
respond
to
her
claim.
chief
justice
burger
the
court
didn't
undertake
to
look
at
it
at
all.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
hodder?
chief
justice
burger
you
want
a
hearing?
chief
justice
burger
do
you
now,
at
this
stage?
are
you
seeking
a
hearing?
chief
justice
burger
where
you
could
put
in
evidence.
chief
justice
burger
is
there
anything
to
prevent
you
from
starting
a
proceeding
more
formally?
without
regard
to
whether
the
first
was
or
was
not
a
proceeding,
is
there
any
bar
to
your
presenting
your
claims
to
the
commission
now,
irrespective
of
what
this
court
does?
chief
justice
burger
when
you
went
to
the
court
of
appeals,
did
you
suggest
to
the
court
of
appeals
that
the
record
was
inadequate
for
review?
chief
justice
burger
did
you
ask
to
have
it
remanded
to
the
commission
to
give
you
the
kind
of
a
hearing
that
you
have
been
talking
about?
chief
justice
burger
any
reason
why
that
can't
be
done
now?
chief
justice
burger
well,
remand
to
the
court
of
appeals,
and
tell
the
court
of
appeals
that
it
does
have
jurisdiction,
and
to
proceed,
and
then
that
would
leave
the
court
of
appeals
free
to
tell
you,
tell
everyone
that
the
record
was
not
adequate
for
review
and
remanded
to
the
commission
to
supplement
the
record.
chief
justice
burger
a
review
on
the
record,
then,
on
the
record
as
it
exists
of
547
pages?
chief
justice
burger
but
you
say
that
you
want
to
supplement
that
record
by
discovery
and
by
more
evidence.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well,
mr.
hodder.
do
you
have
anything
further,
mr.
rothfeld?
you
have
three
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
burger
as
i
understand
mr.
hodder's
argument
is
that
they
have
never
had
a
chance
to
present
anything,
to
make
a
record
here
on
which
any
court
could
review.
chief
justice
burger
ordinarily,
to
present
factual
material,
you
have
at
least
an
invitation
to
a
hearing.
is
that
not
so?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
thank
you,
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
