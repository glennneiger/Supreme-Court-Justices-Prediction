justice
stevens
mr.
rothfeld,
can
i
interrupt
you
just
a
second
to
be
sure
i
have
your
position
correct?
do
you
take
the
position
that
there
was
or
was
not
a
proceeding
within
the
meaning
of
the
first
sentence
of
2239(a)?
justice
stevens
there
was
a
proceeding?
justice
stevens
but
it
was
not
required.
there
was
no
requirement
that
there
be
a
hearing
in
that
proceeding.
justice
stevens
and
so
the
word
"shall"
doesn't
mean
what
it
says?
justice
stevens
in
other
words,
the
word
"shall"
does
not
mean
what
it
says?
justice
stevens
well,
you
may
be
entirely
right.
the
only
thing
i
was
questioning
is
whether
it
is
correct
to
say
that
there
is
no
support
in
the
statutory
language
for
the
contrary
view.
justice
stevens
well,
i
suppose
you
would
still
say
it
was
a
proceeding
even
if
somebody,
some
court
thought
that
you
had
to
have
a
hearing.
justice
stevens
is
it
your
view
that
every
time
some
member
of
the
public
writes
a
letter
to
the
agency
and
says,
i
would
like
you
to
revoke
the
license
of
this
utility,
that
that
is
enough
to
start
a
proceeding?
justice
stevens
every
letter
constitutes
the
commencement
of
a
proceeding?
justice
stevens
and
if
the
agency
just
writes
back
and
says,
we're
too
busy,
we're
sorry,
we
can't
do
it,
that
would
then
be
appealable
to
the
court
of
appeals?
justice
stevens
all
right.
and
i
suppose
under
the
statute
it
could
change
that
rule,
couldn't
it?
couldn't
it
set
up
a
class
of
letters
that
wouldn't
require
such
formal
investigation?
justice
stevens
any
such
exchange
of
letters
you
have,
agency
changes
through
any
such
exchange
of
letters
would
give
rise
to
an
appealable
order,
appealable
to
the
court
of
appeals?
justice
stevens
may
i
ask...
have
you
finished
your
answer?
justice
stevens
a
question
about
2.026(b)
which
says
that
after
you
get
a
request
within
a
reasonable
time
you
will
decide
either
to
institute
the
request
of
proceeding
or
that
no
proceeding
will
be
instituted,
and
is
it
your
position
that
the
decision
of
whether
to
institute
a
proceeding
is
the
proceeding
that
you
are
talking
about?
justice
stevens
where
in
the
regulation
does
it
use
the
word
"proceeding"
the
way
you
are
using
it
today?
justice
stevens
nor
in
the
statute.
justice
stevens
but
not
in
accord
with
the
way
it
is
used
in
the
regulation.
justice
stevens
may
i
ask
just
one
other
question
about
the
court
of
appeals?
did
the
court
dismiss
this
on
its
own
motion?
justice
stevens
mr.
reis,
may
i
ask
you
a
question
about
the
547-page
record
that
the
chief
justice
mentioned?
supposing
there
were
no
such
record,
but
all
we
had
before
us
were
the
letter
from
your
opponent
and
a
reply
that
simply
said,
we
are
not
going
to
institute
a
procedure,
proceeding
because
the
procedures
already
in
place
are
adequate
to
protect
the
public
health
and
safety,
period,
and
then
there
was
review.
would
you
say
that
would
be
reviewable
here?
would
the
case
be
any
different?
does
the
547-page
record
add
or
subtract
from
the
issue
at
all?
justice
stevens
how
could
it
ever
be
arbitrary
and
capricious
for
the
director
to
say,
we
have
a
lot
of
people
who
are
studying
these
things
constantly,
and
we
have
concluded
there
is
no
need
for
this
action?
justice
stevens
you
think
it
could
be
arbitrary
and
capricious?
justice
stevens
may
i
ask
kind
of
a
threshold
question
that
i
have
never
thoroughly
understood
in
this
case?
if
you
assume
that
a
proceeding
doesn't
start
until...
well,
that
this
is
not
a
proceeding
that
we
have
here,
where
is
there
any
statutory
duty
in
the
commission
to
have
anything
more
than
the
kind
of
prosecutorial
discretion
that
a
prosecutor
in
a
criminal
context
would
have?
what
statutory
obligation
is
there
to
institute
proceedings?
isn't
it...
why
couldn't
one
argue
that
it
is
totally
within
the
discretion
of
the
agency?
and
if
there
is
a
statutory
obligation,
what
is
the
standard
in
any
statute
that
tells
when
they
have
to
institute
proceedings?
justice
stevens
this
specific
provision,
you
just
kind
of
read
it
in
the
statute
as
a
whole?
justice
stevens
but
there
is
no
statute
that
says
that
in
so
many
words?
justice
stevens
189(a).
that
is
2239(a).
is
that
the
same
section?
justice
stevens
--you
are
not
then
taking
the
position
that
the
district
court
will
be
performing
a
reviewing
function,
but
rather
it
is
just
a
brand
new
lawsuit,
and
you
just
go
right
into
discovery?
you
are
not
limited
to
the
record
before
the
agency?
justice
stevens
so
you
think
you
are
going
into
the
district
court
bringing
an
original
action,
not
a
review
as
you
review
social
security
cases
or
something
like
that
on
the
record
that
is
before
the
agency?
justice
stevens
i
don't
know
why
you
couldn't
have
done
that
without
ever
taking
this
appeal.
justice
stevens
i
would
expect
the
government
to
take
the
position
that
you
are
quite
wrong
about
that.
i
may
be
wrong.
i
don't
know
what
is
going
on
in
this
lawsuit.
justice
stevens
as
i
read
section
1631,
which
is
what
the
court
of
appeals
relied
on
to
transfer
to
the
district
court,
all
that
does
is
say
the
district
court
may
treat
the
case
as
though
it
were
originally
filed
in
that
court
rather
than
the
court
of
appeals,
and
therefore
it
seems
to
me
it
is
open
to
the
government...
i
don't
know
whether
it's
right
or
not...
it
is
open
to
the
government
to
say,
since
they
decided
it
is
not
a
proceeding
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute,
it
is
just
not
reviewable
at
all.
the
question
of
commencing
proceedings
to
revoke
licenses
and
the
like
are
committed
to
agency
discretion.
i
don't
think
they
have
conceded...
i
may
be
wrong,
but
i
don't
think
they
have
conceded
that
there
is
a
lawsuit
that
is
going
to
go
forward
in
the
district
court.
justice
stevens
and
i
don't
think
the
court
of
appeals
order
requires
it.
justice
stevens
no,
we
granted
cert
on
the
question
of
whether
there
was
jurisdiction
in
the
court
of
appeals
to
review
an
order
which
at
least
on
the
face
of
these
documents
does
not
appear
in
the
proceeding.
it
is
an
order
refusing
to
commence
a
proceeding.
justice
stevens
well,
there
are
situations
in
the
law
where
you
have
a
time
bomb
ticking
in
somebody's
back
yard
and
you
go
to
the
prosecutor
and
say,
i
want
you
to
arrest
that
man,
and
he
says,
well,
i
will
think
about
it,
but
you
can't
make
him
do
it
if
he
decides
not
to
do
it.
justice
stevens
so
that
you
may
well
take
the
position
in
the
district
court
that
this
is
an
unreviewable
refusal
to
institute
a
proceeding.
justice
stevens
under
the
apa,
if
there
were
jurisdiction,
what
would
be
the
standard
of
review?
would
it
be
substantial
evidence,
or
arbitrary
and
capricious?
