justice
jr.
does
the
record
show
how
many
letters
of
this
kind
the
agency
receives
in
a
year?
justice
jr.
what
would
happen
if
400
or
500
were
filed?
i
suppose
you
don't
know,
but
it
is
a
curious
provision
in
the
statute.
justice
jr.
may
i
just
pursue
that
a
little
bit?
i
still
don't
understand.
the
court
of
appeals'
order
that
the
case
be
transferred
to
the
district
court,
and
your
brief
asks
that
that
order
be
affirmed,
so
if
you
prevail
here,
you
will
end
up
in
the
district
court,
right?
justice
jr.
right,
and
what
would
you
ask
the
district
court
to
do,
ultimately
to
decide
the
merits
or
remand
it
to
the
commission
for
it
to
have
a
normal
proceeding?
justice
jr.
it
is
not
remanded.
it
is
just
transferred.
justice
jr.
yes.
justice
jr.
yes.
justice
jr.
to
do
what?
to
decide
the
case?
justice
jr.
so
you
would
make
a
record
before
the
district
court,
and
you
would
not
go
back
to
the
commission?
