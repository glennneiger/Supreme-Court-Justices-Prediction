justice
marshall
you
say
each
one.
do
you
ever
have
any
answer
that
says,
we
have
examined
all
of
the
questions,
and
we
find
no
merit
in
any
of
them,
period?
justice
marshall
well,
you
have
seen
agencies
do
that,
haven't
you?
justice
marshall
in
the
district
court
do
you
have
pleadings?
justice
marshall
i
am
kind
of
old
school,
and
i
think
if
you
are
going
to
have
a
case
in
the
district
court
without
pleadings--
justice
marshall
--could
you
have
done
that
originally?
justice
marshall
how
can
you
do
it
now
if
you
couldn't
have
done
it
originally?
justice
marshall
i
must
say--
justice
marshall
can
you
give
me
a
case?
can
you
give
me
a
case,
another
case
where
this
was
done
any
place?
justice
marshall
any
place
in
the
world.
justice
marshall
all
i
understand
you
transfer
is
your
original
action.
you
are
now
saying
that
you
transfer
a
brand
new
action.
that
is
what
you
said.
justice
marshall
you
can't
transfer
a
brand
new
action.
justice
marshall
what
relief
do
you
want
there?
that
is
the
review.
that
is
the
review
proceeding.
that
is
a
review.
that
is
all
it
is.
justice
marshall
a
review
proceeding
is
the
exact
opposite
of
a
de
novo
proceeding.
justice
marshall
i
thought
you
said
when
you
got
down
to
the
district
court
you
start
all
over
again
with
discovery.
if
discovery
is
not
de
novo,
i
would
like
to
know
what
it
is.
justice
marshall
have
you
had
discovery
before
in
this
case?
justice
marshall
well,
then,
it
is
new,
then,
isn't
it?
justice
marshall
counsel,
you
talk
about
filing
an
amended
complaint.
where
is
the
original
complaint?
justice
marshall
is
that
a
complaint?
justice
marshall
well,
you
know
the
complaint
i
am
talking
about.
the
complaint
under
the
rules.
justice
marshall
you
really
don't
want
to
file
an
amended
complaint,
you
want
to
file
an
original
complaint
in
the
district
court
and
start
an
original,
new
action.
am
i
right
or
wrong?
justice
marshall
well,
would
new
ground
be
a
new
case?
justice
marshall
that
would
give
you
discovery?
