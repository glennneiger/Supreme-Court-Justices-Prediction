justice
o'connor
well,
mr.
rothfeld,
the
respondent,
of
course,
argues
that
congress
limited
jurisdiction
of
the
court
of
appeals
to
cases
in
which
formal
hearings
had
been
held,
so
there
would
be
an
adequate
record
for
review
by
the
appellate
court,
which
of
course
is
the
typical
situation
for
an
appellate
court
review.
now,
how
do
you
respond
to
that
in
cases
where
a
hearing
is
denied?
what
assurance
do
we
have
that
there
would
be
the
kind
of
record
that
would
be
appropriate
for
appellate
court
review?
justice
o'connor
well,
i
guess
here
the
respondent
contends
that
he
was
unable
to
submit
additional
information
to
the
nrc.
justice
o'connor
well,
is
there
anything
in
the
agency's
regulations
that
would
ensure
that
in
every
case
of
a
denial
of
a
hearing,
that
there
is
enough
of
a
record
that
it
would
be
appropriate
for
appellate
court
review?
justice
o'connor
what
regulation
are
you
referring
to?
justice
o'connor
well,
do
you
agree,
mr.
hodder,
that
it
is
reasonable
to
conclude
that
the
statute
only
requires
a
hearing
when
the
requesting
party
makes
a
certain
threshold
showing
of
health
or
safety
risks
or
allegations?
justice
o'connor
well,
is
that
a
reasonable
interpretation
of
the
statute,
do
you
think?
justice
o'connor
mr.
hodder,
i
think
i
don't
understand
your
position
that
if
the
court
of
appeals
determined
that,
let's
say,
they
do
have
jurisdiction,
and
if
it
determined
that
a
hearing
should
have
been
allowed,
why
wouldn't
it
remand
it
to
the
agency
rather
than
to
the
district
court?
i
just
don't
understand
your
position
on
that
at
all.
justice
o'connor
why
doesn't
the
court
of
appeals,
if
it
has
jurisdiction,
look
at
the
record
that
comes
to
it
from
the
agency
to
determine
whether
it
was
an
abuse
of
discretion
to
deny
a
hearing?
and
if,
according
to
the
record,
the
court
of
appeals
said
that
a
hearing
should
have
been
provided
by
the
agency,
wouldn't
it
send
it
back
to
the
agency,
not
the
district
court?
