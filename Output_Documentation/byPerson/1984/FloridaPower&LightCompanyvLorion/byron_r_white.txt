justice
white
there
must
be
some
favorite
correspondents
that
you
don't
start
a
proceeding
to
answer.
justice
white
well,
the
court
of
appeals
decision
rationale
wouldn't...
change
the
court
you
go
to
on
review.
justice
white
so
any
one
of
these
letters,
if
you
answer
it
and
say,
sorry,
george,
that
is
reviewable
in
the
district
court
under
the
court
of
appeals.
justice
white
and
didn't
you
suggest
that
perhaps
whether
there
should
have
been
a
hearing
is
still
open?
justice
white
well,
mr.
reis,
if
they
aren't,
they
could
be
sent
back.
justice
white
well,
you
went
to
the
court
of
appeals
on
appeal,
and
one
of
your
claims
was,
i
suppose,
that
you
were
entitled
to
a
hearing.
justice
white
wasn't
that
one
of
your
claims?
you
were
entitled
to
a
hearing?
justice
white
that's
what
you
wanted.
justice
white
and
if
the
court
of
appeals
decision
is
sustained,
you
are
going
to
be
in
the
district
court
claiming
that
you
were
entitled
to
a
hearing.
justice
white
but
you
will
be
asking
the
judge
to
remand
it
to
the
agency
for
the
hearing.
justice
white
would
there
be
a
de
novo
hearing?
justice
white
my
point
is,
my
point
is,
though,
the
court
of
appeals
never
decided,
never
got
to
the
question
of
whether
you
were
entitled
to
a
hearing.
they
just
dismissed
you
for
want
of
jurisdiction.
justice
white
and
if
we
affirm...
if
we
reverse
them
and
say
they
have
jurisdiction,
they
are
going
to
have
to
face
up
to
your
claim
that
you
are
entitled
to
a
hearing.
justice
white
well,
you
may
win.
justice
white
they
may
remand
and
say
the
agency
abused
its
discretion
in
not
giving
you
a
hearing.
justice
white
well,
let's
assume
we
affirm
the
court
of
appeals.
then
the
next
case
comes
up
like
yours.
if
you
don't
like
what
the...
and
you
are
turned
down,
and
you
don't
like
the
result,
you
then
go
right
into
district
court.
you
don't
go
to
the
court
of
appeals.
you
go
into
the
district
court,
because
you
have
just
been
told
that
the
court
of
appeals
has
no
jurisdiction,
so
you
go
right
into
the
district
court,
and
that
is
just...
you
file
a
complaint
to
review
the
agency's
decision,
don't
you?
justice
white
well,
how
can
you
go
to
the
court
of
appeals?
if
we
affirm
the
court
of
appeals,
you
know
that
the
court
of
appeals
has
no
jurisdiction
at
all.
so
you
go
to
the
district
court.
justice
white
and
what
would
you
claim...
wouldn't
you
have
to
claim
jurisdiction
under
1331?
justice
white
it
is
the
review
of
administrative--
justice
white
--of?
justice
white
when
you
seek
that
kind
of
review
under
the
administrative
procedure
act,
what
is
your
jurisdictional
basis?
justice
white
what
do
you
think?
what
do
you
think
when
there
is
apa
review
in
a
district
court
because
it
isn't
provided
for
somewhere
else?
justice
white
i
know
you
haven't,
but
my
question
was,
if
you
were
going
there,
what
would
you
suppose,
if
you
were
going
to
try
to
go
there,
what
jurisdictional
basis
would
there
be
in
the
district
court?
justice
white
yes,
i
understand.
