justice
white
it
will
just
drive
all
plaintiffs
to
federal
court.
justice
white
i
suppose
you
would
like
to
be
able
to
have
your
own
state
courts
enforce
your
own
state
antitrust
act.
justice
white
well,
the
plurality
at
least
thought
that
section
1738
just
wasn't
applicable
in
this
case,
didn't
it?
justice
white
what
if
we...
you
think
that
it
is.
justice
white
suppose
we
agreed
with
you
and
disagreed
with
the
seventh
circuit
in
that
regard.
do
we
need
to
go
any
farther,
or
did
they
go
on
and
say
even
if
1738
is
applicable,
we
are
giving
no
more
effect
to
the
state
court
judgment
than
the
state
courts
would.
didn't
they
say
that...
didn't
they
disagree
with
you,
or
they
disagreed
with
your
position
that
the
state
courts
would
not
give
claim
preclusion
in
this
case?
justice
white
it
didn't.
justice
white
if
we
disagreed
with
the
seventh
circuit
on
the
applicability
of
1738,
why
should
we
go
any
farther?
justice
white
i
know,
but
i
thought
that
if
1738
is
applicable,
the
preclusion
claim
in
the
federal
court
has
to
be
decided
on
the
basis
of
how
the
state
court
would.
justice
white
yes,
but
your
position
is
that
under
state
law
there
would
be
no
preclusion
in
this
case.
justice
white
i
mean,
if
you
follow
their
principle
of
preclusion,
that
you
wouldn't
get
preclusion
at
all.
justice
white
if
you
are
right
in
that
regard,
why,
we
don't
have
to
talk
about
what
the
federal
rule
would
be,
do
we,
if
we
disagreed
on
1738.
justice
white
you
mean
as
a
federal
rule.
justice
white
of
preclusion...
of
nonpreclusion.
justice
white
you
said
that.
justice
white
suppose
we
disagree
with
respect
to
the
applicability
of
section
1738.
what
should
we
do?
should
we
stop
there
and
remand
were
the
seventh
circuit
to
decide
what
the
state...
what
effect
the
state
rule
would...
the
state
courts
would
give
to
this--
justice
white
--does
apply.
justice
white
well,
suppose
we
did
it.
justice
white
he
didn't
write
the
plurality?
justice
white
what
do
you
think
he
said
the
illinois
claim
preclusion
law
is
or
was?
justice
white
even
though
the
second
claim
couldn't
have
been
raised
in
the
first?
justice
white
what
was
the
vote
in
this
case
below?
i
mean,
on
the
judgment.
justice
white
five
to
four.
well,
if
we
disagree...
judge
posner
didn't
think
1738
was
applicable,
right?
justice
white
yes.
do
you
defend
that?
justice
white
well,
if
that
is
so,
what
do
you
think
the
four
people
would
say?
they
thought
1738
was
applicable,
didn't
they?
justice
white
well,
now,
if
we
disagree
with
judge
posner,
i
would
think
then
there
would
be
a
majority
that
would
approach
the
case
on
the
basis
of
what
is
the
state
law.
justice
white
we
don't
know
what
the
people
who
joined
judge
posner
would
say
about
state
law,
do
we?
justice
white
yes,
flamm,
yes,
but
nobody
else.
justice
white
but
that
is
not
quite
enough.
justice
white
was
this
decision
below,
was
that
before
or
after
migra?
justice
white
right.
justice
white
it
may
have
been
that
we
should
have
vacated
and
remanded
on
migra
rather
than
taking
the
case
for
plenary
consideration.
but
here
you
are.
justice
white
what
do
you
think
about
your
colleague's
suggestion
on
the
other
side
that
there
is
an
exception
to
1738?
justice
white
well,
because
of
the
overriding
federal
interest
and
that...
yes.
you
are
right.
justice
white
you
don't
think
there
is
a--
justice
white
yes,
without
prejudice,
but
what
if
it
is
just
decided?
justice
white
what
if
it
is
just...
two
concurrent
suits,
one
of
them
is...
whichever
one
is
decided
first
is
going...
may
at
least
affect
some
issues
in
the
other
suit.
justice
white
and
finally
preclude,
they
will
issue
preclusion
based
on
whichever
case
finished
first.
and
there
may
be
claim
preclusion.
justice
white
but
don't
you
agree
that
one
effect
of
this
decision
below
is
that
plaintiffs
may
more
often
take
their
whole
ball
of
wax
to
the
federal
court
than
to
start
a
state
case?
justice
white
and
which
means
that
they
will
take
their
pendent
state
claims
over
to
the
federal
court.
