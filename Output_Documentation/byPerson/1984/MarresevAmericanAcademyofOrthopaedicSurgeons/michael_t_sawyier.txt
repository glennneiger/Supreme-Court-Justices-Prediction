mr.
michael
t.
sawyier
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
this
case
presents
the
basic
question
whether
the
plurality
opinion
of
the
seventh
circuit
was
correct
in
making
what
justice
potter
stewart
referred
to
as
a
completely
unprecedented
expansion
of
the
res
judicata
doctrine
for
extremely
dubious
reasons.
after
two
successively
vacated
panel
decisions,
both
dissented
to
by
justice
stewart,
a
five-to-four
majority
of
the
seventh
circuit
held
that
the
present
exclusively
federal
antitrust
action
is
precluded
by
claim
preclusion
as
the
result
of
the
illinois
court's
dismissal
of
the
petitioners'
two
previous
illinois
court
actions
against
the
respondent.
however,
because
of
the
exclusive
federal
jurisdiction
over
federal
antitrust
actions,
this
action
could
not
possibly
have
been
brought
in
the
illinois
courts.
the
actions
that
the
petitioner
did
bring
there
were
state
common
law
actions,
and
had
nothing
to
do
with
antitrust
law,
and
those
actions
were
dismissed
at
the
outset
for
failure
to
allege
a
claim
under
that
completely
different
body
of
law.
in
1976
and
1977,
when
those
state
court
actions
were
filed,
no
practicing
lawyer
would
have
imagined
that
their
outcome
might
preclude
by
claim
preclusion
any
subsequent
exclusively
federal
claim,
yet
that
is
the
radical
and
unjust
result
of
the
seventh
circuit's
claim
preclusion
decision
as
here
imposed
upon
the
petitioners,
thus
in
effect
denying
them
any
day
in
court
with
respect
to
their
present
exclusively
federal
claim.
at
no
point
during
the
course
of
this
action
has
the
respondent
dared
to
attempt
to
defend
the
merits
of
the
exclusionary
actions
that
it
took
toward
the
petitioners.
instead,
it
is
argued
to
the
district
court
that
the
petitioners
do
not
need
to
see
their
application
files,
because
the
information
contained
in
them,
and
i
quote,
"would
not
substantially
add
to
or
detract
from
their
general
understanding
of
the
facts.
"
the
petitioners'
general
understanding
of
the
facts,
your
honors,
is
set
forth
at
pages
4
to
5
of
their
principal
brief
to
this
court.
they
have
alleged
that
dr.
treister
was
excluded
from
the
respondent
as
a
result
of
a
conspiracy
by
the
respondent's
members
to
limit
the
output
of
expert
testimony
for
plaintiffs
in
medical
malpractice
actions
against
orthopaedic
surgeons
in
the
chicago
area.
they
have
alleged
that
dr.
marrese
was
likewise
excluded
for
inherently
illegal
anticompetitive
reasons.
they
have
further
alleged
that
the
respondent's
entire
nationwide
admission
system
is
procedurally
arbitrary
and
unfair,
so
unfair
that
the
respondent
in
fact
purports
to
prohibit
any
rejected
applicant
from
questioning
in
any
manner
an
adverse
admission
decision.
the
petitioners
have
never
received
a
hearing
on
these
claims,
and
unless
this
court
reverses
the
seventh
circuit's
radical
claim
preclusion
decision,
they
never
will
receive
such
a
hearing.
the
states
of
the
seventh
circuit
have
ably
demonstrated
the
strong
policy
objections
to
compelling
plaintiffs
with
both
state
law
and
exclusively
federal
claims
to
bring
their
state
law
claims
in
federal
court.
indeed,
the
spectacle
of
state
governments
having
to
litigate
their
state
law
claim
in
federal
court
is
so
objectionable
that
it
by
itself
discredits
the
seventh
circuit's
approach.
but
the
petitioners
would
emphasize
in
addition
the
following
three
decisive
points,
any
one
of
which
is
sufficient
to
require
the
reversal
of
the
seventh
circuit's
claim
preclusion
decision.
first,
there
is
an
overriding
federal
rule
of
the
nonpreclusion
of
exclusively
federal
claims
by
claim
preclusion
as
the
result
of
previous
judgments
when
the
previous
tribunals
lacked
subject
matter
jurisdiction
over
such
claims.
second,
as
the
states
of
the
seventh
circuit
have
demonstrated
to
this
court,
illinois'
claim
preclusion
rules
have
always
recognized
and
applied
this
same
fundamental
could
have
been
raised
principle,
which
is
the
fundamental
fairness
limitation
of
the
claim
preclusion
doctrine.
third,
even
if
the
fourth
circuit's
adoption
of
the
identity
analysis
in
nash
were
correct,
so
that
a
state
antitrust
claim
could
ever
conceivably
substitute
for
an
exclusively
federal
antitrust
claim,
this
case
is
not
that
case.
the
illinois
antitrust
actions
that
were
the
only
antitrust
actions
which
petitioners
could
previously
have
brought
in
the
illinois
courts
simply
are
not
the
same
as
the
present
exclusively
federal
action.
there
are
two
principal
lines
of
authority
for
the
overriding
federal
rule
of
nonpreclusion.
first,
the
long-established
prior
jurisdictional
competency
requirement
of
federal
claim
preclusion
as
embodied
in
the
could
have
been
raised
limitation
of
that
doctrine.
second,
the
independent
federal
interest
in
what
judge
learned
hand
referred
to
as
the
untrammeled
jurisdiction
of
the
federal
courts
over
the
various
grants
of
exclusively
federal
jurisdiction.
mr.
michael
t.
sawyier
your
honor,
the
petitioners
do
not
take
a
position
on
that
issue
except
to
point
out
that
in
the
case
of
the
previous
state
court
actions
that
are
here
concerned,
there
were
no
determinations
of
fact,
there
were
no
determinations
of
law
except
for
a
determination
that
a
technical
pleading
requirement
of
illinois
common
law
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
antitrust
laws
was
not
satisfied.
in
fact,
the
petitioners
have
argued
that
the
fact
that
there
were
no
determinations
in
the
illinois
court
is
itself
an
argument
for
the
particular
unfairness
of
the
preclusion
here.
mr.
michael
t.
sawyier
we
believe
that
just
as
the
states
of
the
seventh
circuit
have
stated,
the
nash
case
and
for
that
matter
the
derish
case,
in
fact
support
our
position
because
of
the
material
differences
between
the
illinois
antitrust
statute
and
the
sherman
act
and
the
clayton
act
as
well
as
the
fact
that
no
antitrust
action
was
in
fact
brought
in
the
state
courts.
but
as
for
the
question
of
issue
preclusion
as
to
issues
of
fact,
the
petitioners
believe
that
issue
preclusion
of
that
sort
may
be
consistent
with
the
regime
of
exclusively
federal
grants
of
jurisdiction.
mr.
michael
t.
sawyier
yes,
it
did.
mr.
michael
t.
sawyier
your,
honor,
we
believe
that
section
1738
is
generally
applicable.
the
plurality's
position
that
the
statute
was
inherently
inapplicable
so
that
even
in
the
absence
of
an
overriding--
mr.
michael
t.
sawyier
--the
seventh
circuit
did
not
get
into
the
question
of
state
preclusion
law.
mr.
michael
t.
sawyier
that
is
correct.
judge
flamming
referred
in
passing
to
his
particular--
mr.
michael
t.
sawyier
--because,
your
honor,
there
is
an
overriding
federal
rule
of
nonpreclusion
which
avoids
the
necessity
to
get
into
these
questions
of
state
preclusion
law.
mr.
michael
t.
sawyier
in
general,
that
is
absolutely
correct,
your
honor,
but
in
kremer
v.
chemical
construction
corporation,
this
court
pointed
out
two
exceptions
to
the
general
rule
of
section
1738,
and
the
petitioners
believe
that
the
more
important
of
those
exceptions
is
not
the
implied
statutory
exception,
although
in
brown
v.
felson
that
implied
statutory
exception
was
clearly
indicated.
the
petitioners
believe
that
the
more
important
exception
was
the
full...
the
concept
of
the
full
and
fair
opportunity
to
litigate
that
is
necessary
for
any
preclusion.
in
kremer--
mr.
michael
t.
sawyier
--absolutely,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
t.
sawyier
that's
correct.
mr.
michael
t.
sawyier
your
honor,
we
believe
that
this
court
should
decide
this
matter
on
the
basis
of
a
federal
rule
so
that
it
is
not
necessary
in
administering
the
various
grants
of
exclusively
federal
jurisdiction
to
inquire
into
state
preclusion
rules,
although,
to
be
sure,
the
petitioners
are
unaware
of
any
state's
claim
preclusion
rules
that
would
call
for
the
preclusion
of
a
claim
that
could
not
possibly
have
been
raised
in
the
previous
tribunal.
but,
your
honor,
i
would
like
to
return
to
the
concept
of
the
full
and
fair
opportunity
to
litigate
in
kremer.
mr.
michael
t.
sawyier
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
t.
sawyier
of
nonpreclusion.
precisely.
if
even
the
relitigation
of
exactly
the
same
issue
may
not
be
precluded,
as
this
court
said
in
kremer,
even
the
relitigation
of
exactly
the
same
issue
may
not
be
precluded.
mr.
michael
t.
sawyier
unless
the
parties
have
received
a
full
and
fair
opportunity
to
litigate
it
in
the
previous
proceeding,
then
surely
the
initial
litigation
of
an
entire
claim
no
aspect
of
which
could
have
been
litigated
in
the
prior
proceeding
may
never
be
precluded.
the
jurisdictional
impossibility
of
bringing
a
claim
in
the
previous
forum
is
the
opposite
of
the
full
and
fair
opportunity
to
litigate
it
which
this
court
said
in
kremer
is
necessary
for
preclusion.
the
respondent
has
also
been
utterly
unable
to
respond
to
the
petitioner's
third
point
concerning
the
materially
different
applicable
standards
of
liability
and
damages
as
between
the
illinois
antitrust
actions
that
they
might
have
brought
but
did
not
and
their
present
exclusively
federal
antitrust
action.
here
and
now,
the
petitioners
challenge
the
respondents
once
again
to
say
anything
in
response
to
their
analysis
of
the
applicable
standards
of
liability
and
damages.
mr.
michael
t.
sawyier
your
honor,
the
petitioners
are
not
opposed
to
the
application
of
issue
preclusion
as
to
issues
of
fact
from
a
state
court
proceeding
to
an
exclusively
federal
antitrust
proceeding.
they
do
say,
however,
that
that
is
not
the
issue
in
this
case,
because
there
were
no
issues
determined
in
the
illinois
actions
except
for
the
technical
pleading
requirement
of
illinois
common
law.
in
conclusion,
your
honors,
the
petitioners
respectfully
ask
this
court
to
reverse
the
seventh
circuit's
claim
preclusion
decision
which
the
dissenters
below
rightly
describe
as
an
arbitrary
and
unjust
denial
of
access
to
the
federal
courts.
that
decision
was
not
only
arbitrary
and
unjust.
it
offended
the
fundamental
principle
identified
by
justice
stewart,
the
principle
that
parties,
not
judges,
choose
the
forum.
at
the
same
time,
and
it
is
a
necessary
result
of
that
decision,
the
petitioners
respectfully
ask
this
court
to
reverse
the
criminal
contempt
decision.
that
decision
was
absolutely
dependent
upon
the
claim
preclusion
decision,
as
demonstrated
by
the
petitioner's
supplemental
brief
concerning
roland
machinery
company
v.
dresser
industries,
inc.
the
standard
of
review
of
discovery
orders
in
the
seventh
circuit
is
that
of
whether
any
reasonable
person
could
agree
with
them.
your
honors,
justice
potter
stewart,
chief
judge
cummins,
and
the
other
dissenters
on
the
seventh
circuit
agreed
with
district
judge
shader's
discovery
orders.
therefore,
the
only
basis
for
the
seventh
circuit's
criminal
contempt
decision
must
have
been
its
holding--
mr.
michael
t.
sawyier
--that
is
certainly
correct,
your
honor.
however,
in
this
case,
the
criminal
contempt
decision
turned
on
the
claim
preclusion
decision,
and
the
entire
case
is
before
this
court.
mr.
michael
t.
sawyier
the
petitioners
certainly
are
prepared
to
point
out
to
the
seventh
circuit
the
fact
that
judge
bowers'
concurring
opinion
was
a
concurrence
only
in
the
result,
and
that
judge
bower
was
one
of
the
members
of
the
majority
in
roland
machinery
company
in
which
the
seventh
circuit
emphasized
the
rule
of
discretion
in
the
strong
sense
as
to
discovery
orders
such
that
the
test
is
whether
any
reasonable
person
could
agree
with
that.
in
terms
of
that
test,
the
only
explanation
for
the
seventh
circuit's
criminal
contempt
decision
must
have
been
its
holding,
its
express
holding
that
the
criminal
contempt
fell
with
the
case.
thank
you,
your
honors.
we
would
reserve
the
remaining
time.
mr.
michael
t.
sawyier
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
t.
sawyier
the
respondent
has
talked
about
the
unfairness
to
it
of
the
petitioners
having
had
the
opportunity
to
proceed
in
state
court
first
and
to
exercise
their
right
to
a
state
court
forum
for
their
state
law
claims.
the
petitioners
believe
that
the
true
unfairness
is
the
fact
that
they
never
had
any
opportunity,
much
less
a
full
and
fair
opportunity
to
litigate
the
exclusively
federal
claim
in
the
state
court
forum,
and
yet
the
seventh
circuit
has
held
in
its
claim
preclusion
decision
that
the
exclusively
federal
claim
is
barred
by
the
technical
pleading
requirements
of
illinois
common
law.
the
petitioners
would
return,
your
honors,
to
the
fundamental
concept
of
a
full
and
fair
opportunity
to
litigate
that
this
court
emphasized
in
kremer.
kremer,
of
course,
laid
down
the
general
principle
or
followed
the
allen
case
in
extending
the
general
principle
of
the
full
faith
and
credit
requirement
of
section
1738.
but
in
kremer
this
court
recognized
that
if
the
parties
had
not
had
a
full
and
fair
opportunity
to
litigate
an
issue
in
state
court
in
the
previous
forum,
then
there
would
be
no
issue
preclusion,
notwithstanding
the
ordinary
effect
of
section
1738,
and
notwithstanding
in
particular
what
the
state's
preclusion
rule
said
on
that
subject.
mr.
michael
t.
sawyier
in
that
sense,
your
honor,
the
full
and
fair
opportunity
to
litigate
concept
might
be
regarded
as
something
even
more
basic
than
an
exception
to
section
1738.
it
is
a
fundamental
fairness
requirement,
and
for
that
reason
the
petitioners
maintain
that
the
claim
preclusion
of
an
action
that
could
not
possibly
have
been
brought
in
the
previous
forum
is
so
fundamentally
unfair,
and
so
antithetical
to
the
regime
of
exclusively
federal
rights
that
this
court
should
rule
as
a
matter
of
a
federal
rule
that
no
such
claim
preclusion
can
occur.
your
honors,
the
respondent
has
chided
the
petitioners
for
taking
words
out
of
cases
and
twisting
them.
the
petitioners
submit
that
the
respondent's
discussion
of
the
most
recent
illinois
supreme
court
pronouncement
on
the
res
judicata
doctrine
is
a
classic
example
of
the
fault
for
which
the
petitioners
are
criticized.
the
respondent
has
noted
that
in
spiller
the
illinois
supreme
court
did
not
add
the
usual
words
in
the
original
action
after
reciting
the
centuries
old
could
have
been
raised
test.
your
honors,
on
the
very
next
page
of
the
case
report
of
spiller
the
illinois
supreme
court
locked
to
the
original
action
in
the
illinois
courts
in
deciding
that
there
was
no
claim
preclusion,
and
the
three
illinois
supreme
court
cases
that
it
cited
had
all
used
those
very
words.
thank
you,
your
honors.
