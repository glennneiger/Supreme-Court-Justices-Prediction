mr.
charles
w.
murdock
thank
you.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court,
the
facts,
briefly
stated,
are
these.
dr.
treister
filed
suit
in
state
court
to
compel
respondents
to
grant
him
a
fair
hearing
on
his
application
for
membership.
the
illinois
appellate
court
in
a
case
of
first
impression
held
that
under
certain
circumstances
illinois
courts
can
inquire
into
membership
practices
of
a
voluntary
organization,
but
these
circumstances
are
limited
to
the
situation
in
which
the
membership
in
the
organization
is
a
matter
of
economic
necessity.
accordingly,
the
illinois
appellate
court
dismissed
the
complaint.
no
evidentiary
hearings
were
ever
held.
petitioner
then
filed
suit
in
federal
court
under
section
1
of
the
sherman
act.
the
seventh
circuit
in
a
five-to-four
en
banc
decision
held
that
the
federal
suit
was
barred
on
the
basis
of
claim
preclusion.
the
position
of
the
state
can
be
summarized
as
follows.
the
preclusive
effect,
if
any,
of
a
prior
state
judgment
on
a
subsequent
exclusively
federal
cause
of
action
should
be
limited
to
issue
preclusion.
the
decision
of
the
seventh
circuit,
standing
as
it
does
on
claim
preclusion,
is
unsound
from
a
policy
standpoint,
unworkable
and
unnecessary
from
a
practical
standpoint,
and
unsupportable
from
a
legal
standpoint.
mr.
charles
w.
murdock
actually,
we
are
more
concerned
about
the
effect
that
this
case
will
have
on
enforcement
proceedings.
in
effect,
it
establishes
a
rule
that
when
you
have
both
a
state
claim
and
an
exclusively
federal
claim,
the
federal
claim
must
be
brought
in
the
first
instance
in
federal
court,
and
then
under
pendant
jurisdiction
the
state
claims
must
be
appended
to
it
or
else
under
claim
preclusion
arising
out
of
the
federal
proceeding
they
will
be
lost
and
could
not
be
brought
in
a
state
proceeding.
so,
the
net
effect
of
this
is
that
any
time
you
have
both
a
state
claim
and
an
arguably
colorable
exclusively
federal
claim,
the
state
claim
can
never
from
a
practical
effect
be
determined
in
state
court.
mr.
charles
w.
murdock
that's
right,
and
that
is
why
from
a
policy
standpoint
you
are
going
to
increase
the
work
load
of
the
federal
court.
mr.
charles
w.
murdock
yes.
mr.
charles
w.
murdock
well,
not
only
our
antitrust
act,
your
honor,
but
the
decision,
we
believe,
also
is
unworkable
because
it
assumes
that
when
you
bring...
when
you
file
your
first
suit,
you
know
what
you
have,
and
that
simply
is
not
the
case.
if
i
can
use
an
example
derived
from
the
fifth
circuit's
decision
in
hayes
versus
solomon,
the
lessor,
when
he
files
his
state
court
proceeding,
may
realize
that
he
has
a
breach
of
lease
case,
but
it
is
not
until
discovery
and
investigation
that
he
may
realize
that
the
breach
of
lease
is
part
of
a
broader
scheme
that
also
gives
rise
to
a
federal
antitrust
claim.
now,
under
the
seventh
circuit's
decision,
arguably
the
federal
claim
is
then
barred
because
you
started
the
state
proceeding.
if
it
proceeds
to
judgment,
it
will
then
bar
the
subsequent
federal
proceeding.
what
happens
here
is
that,
in
the
example
that
i
have
just
illustrated,
plus
we
have
found
often
from
our
own
experience
that
what
starts
out
as
a
consumer
fraud
case,
for
example,
may
turn
into
a
securities
case,
or
an
antitrust
case,
or
civil
rico
case,
and
what
happens
is,
the
state's
claim,
the
state
suit
is
properly
brought
in
state
court.
now,
normally
when
there
is
discovery
and
additional
investigation,
and
additional
facts
show
there
will
be
another
claim,
you
simply
amend
your
state
court
suit,
but
when
what
you
discover
is
an
exclusively
federal
claim
you
cannot
amend
your
state
court
suit.
now,
justice
flamm's
solution
to
this
impasse
is
to
file
two
suits,
a
state
court
suit,
the
state
claim
in
state
court,
the
federal
court
claim
in
federal
court.
but
what
then
happens
is,
you
have
two
suits
proceeding
simultaneously.
you
will
have
duplicative
discovery,
duplicative
motion
practice,
and
obviously
one
suit
will
go
to
judgment
first.
then,
if
these
do
involve
the
same
transaction,
the
first
judgment
will
undoubtedly
have
some
preclusive
effect
on
the
second
suit,
and
that
means
that
any
of
the
proceedings,
or
at
least
some
of
the
proceedings
in
the
second
suit
are
redundant.
now,
this
certainly
is
not
judicial
economy.
now,
finally,
or
really,
the
state
believes
that
issue
preclusion
will
take
care
of
most
of
the
concerns
that
the
seventh
circuit
raised.
to
take
the
parade
of
horribles
example
in
derish
versus
san
mateo,
if
you
had
a
state
antitrust
statute
that
was
identical
to
the
federal
antitrust
statute
and
the
state
court
suit
first
went
to
judgment
and
there
was
a
trial,
the
second
suit
will
be
barred
not
on
claim
preclusion
but
on
issue
preclusion
because
a
necessary
fact
for
the
federal
suit
will
have
been
determined
in
the
state
suit.
finally,
your
honors,
the
seventh
circuit
decision
is
legally
unsupportable.
this
court
last
term
in
migra
held
that
a
federal
court
must
look
to
state
law
to
determine
the
preclusive
effect
of
a
state
court
judgment,
and
illinois
law
is
absolutely
clear
that
the
first
court
must
have
jurisdiction
to
determine
the
claim
sought
to
be
barred
in
the
second
suit.
there
are
two
illinois
decisions
that
establish
that
principle,
neither
one
of
which
is
cited
in
any
of
the
briefs.
these
cases
are
barton
versus
southwick,
258
illinois
515,
and
phelps
versus
city
of
chicago,
331
illinois
80.
phelps
is
directly
on
point.
it
involved
a
first
action,
an
ejectment
in
which
the
city
of
chicago
did
not
assert
the
validity
of
certain
tax
deeds.
while
the
suit
was
pending,
a
statute
was
amended
which
would
have
permitted
such
a
claim
to
be
brought
in
the
ejectment
proceeding.
later,
the
city
in
a
partition
proceeding
sought
to
raise
assert
the
validity
of
the
tax
deeds.
the
illinois
supreme
court
held
that
had
the
first
suit
gone
to
judgment
before
the
statute
was
amended,
the
first
suit
would
not
have
been
res
judicata
with
respect
to
the
validity
of
the
tax
deeds
because
that
claim
could
not
have
been
raised
in
the
first
suit,
but
since
the
first
suit
went
to
judgment
after
the
statute
was
amended,
the
validity
of
the
tax
deeds
could
have
been
asserted,
and
therefore
the
city
was
estopped,
precluded...
issue
preclusion...
from
raising
that.
thus
illinois
clearly
requires
that
the
first
court
must
have
jurisdiction
over
the
second
claim
in
order
for
the
second
claim
to
be
barred
by
issue
preclusion.
accordingly,
the
state
would
ask
this
court
to
reverse
the
decision
of
the
seventh
circuit.
mr.
charles
w.
murdock
your
honor,
the
fourth
circuit's
decision
may
be
right
in
the
result
but
wrong
on
the
reasoning,
since
it
involved,
first
of
all,
a
settlement,
and
arguably
out
of
a
settlement
of
a
claim
you
can
assume
a
waiver,
although...
actually
were
the
documents
that
gave
rise
to
the
settlement.
it
can
be
rationalized
on
that
basis.
also
i
believe
it
did
involve
a
statute
that
was
almost
identical
to
the
federal
statute.
thank
you.
