justice
rehnquist
mr.
murdock,
in
your
amicus
brief
on
behalf
of
the
state
of
illinois,
you
say,
"the
attorneys
general
are
greatly
interested
in
the
correct
application
of
the
laws
of
the
united
states.
"
is
there
any
more
particularized
concern
that
you
as
attorney
general
of
illinois
have
in
this
case?
justice
rehnquist
so
your
concern
isn't
just
that
the
state
is
a
potential
antitrust
plaintiff.
you
do
have
a
kind
of
a
broader
picture
than
that.
justice
rehnquist
does
the
state
take
a
position
on
the
correctness
of
the
fourth
circuit's
decision
in
the
nash
county
case?
justice
rehnquist
does
this
federal
interest
extend
so
far
as
to
preclude
a
sort
of
issue
preclusion
if
the
same
facts
have
been
litigated
in
a
state
court
action,
albeit
where
you
could
not
have
litigated
the
federal
claim,
if
that
nucleus
of
facts
has
been
litigated
and
the
state
court
has
made
factual
determination.
justice
rehnquist
so
you
don't
have
to
deal
with
the
nash
county
decision
one
way
or
another?
justice
rehnquist
mr.
sawyier,
under
your
theory
of
this
federal
rule
that
goes...
it
is
bigger
than
1738,
i
guess,
is
the
way
you
are
putting
it.
supposing
that
there
had
been
an
illinois
antitrust
action
filed
and
it
was
litigated
and
one
of
the
issues
was
the
good
faith
of
the
respondent,
and
the
illinois
trial
court
found
that
the
respondent
acted
in
good
faith
at
all
times.
now,
supposing
you
now
bring
the
federal
antitrust
claim,
and
for
some
reason
the
issue
of
good
faith
is
again
relevant.
now,
can
the
respondent
argue
preclusion
in
the
federal
antitrust
case
by
virtue
of
the
earlier
litigation?
justice
rehnquist
mr.
sawyier,
as
i
read
your
petition,
there
are
only
three
questions
presented.
i
thought
they
all
related
to
the
res
judicata.
justice
rehnquist
well,
wouldn't
it
be
more
consonant
with
our
rules
if
we
rule
with
you
on
the
res
judicata
point
to
reverse
and
remand
the
seventh
circuit
and
let
them
decide
whether
one
is
contingent
upon
the
other.
justice
rehnquist
--if
he
wants
to
present
a
lot
of
evidence
by
hearsay
and
it
is
barred
by
the
federal
rules
of
evidence,
he
loses
on
the
application
of
those
rules
of
evidence
just
as
someone
would
in
any
other
case.
justice
rehnquist
they
have
a
problem
if
they
are
simply
substituting
for
the
plaintiff
in
this
case,
don't
they?
supposing
they
had
sued
the
respondent
in
this
case
under
the
same
state
law
the
plaintiff
did,
and
then
lost
on
the
state
claim.
now,
it
is
conceivable
that
perhaps
they
might
have
a
federal
claim
of
some
sort,
too,
that
would
be
precluded.
i
thought
their
argument
was,
we
want
to
be
able
to
take
our
state
claims
to
state
court
first,
and
not
have
to
just
join
them
as
pendent
claims
in
a
federal
action.
justice
rehnquist
let's
posit
a
state
antitrust
law,
and
then
the
state
sues
to
recover
damages
under
the
state
antitrust
laws,
and
loses
for
some
reason
or
other.
they
say
that
they
shouldn't
be
precluded
from
then
filing
a
federal
action
because
otherwise
they
will
never
file
an
action
for
state
antitrust
damages
in
state
court.
it
will
always
be
a
pendent
action
to
the
federal
one,
because
they
can't
risk
going
in
two
separate
courts.
justice
rehnquist
don't
you
in
order
to
get
the
lack
of
fair
opportunity
to
litigate
exception
involved
first
show
that
the
general
principle
is
applicable,
that
is,
that
illinois
would
say
this
was
precluded?
then
you
would
come
in
and
say,
well,
even
though
illinois
says
that,
we
didn't
have
a
full
and
fair
opportunity
to
litigate,
but
i
don't
think
the
exception
makes
a
great
deal
of
sense
until
you
are
first
hooked
by
the
general
proposition,
which
was
that
illinois
would
preclude
this.
