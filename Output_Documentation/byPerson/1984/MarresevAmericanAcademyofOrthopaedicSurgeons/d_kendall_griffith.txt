mr.
d.
kendall
griffith
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
during
the
four
years
that
this
case
has
been
pending
in
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals,
this
court
has
issued
a
series
of
opinions
dealing
with
the
application
of
the
full
faith
and
credit
statute,
section
1738,
to
res
judicata
cases
where
a
prior
state
court
judgment
is
being
asserted
as
a
bar
in
a
later
federal
court
action.
this
case
adds
an
additional
element.
that
element
is
the
fact
that
in
this
instance,
the
claim
being
asserted
in
the
later
federal
court
suit
is
within
the
exclusive
jurisdiction
of
the
federal
courts.
it
is
an
antitrust
claim.
it
is
the
respondent's
contention
that
the
addition
of
this
new
element
does
not
alter
the
standards
for
applying
1738
in
these
types
of
cases
that
have
been
announced
by
this
court
recently.
we
further
submit
that
when
the
nature
and
the
purposes
of
the
policies
of
both
finality
of
judgments,
full
faith
and
credit,
and
exclusive
jurisdiction
are
examined
and
compared,
they
do
not
affect
the
principles
of
finality
of
judgment
which
these
recent
cases
have
announced.
in
allen,
this
court
said
that
congress
specifically
required
federal
courts
to
give
preclusive
effect
to
state
court
judgments
when
the
courts
of
the
rendering
states
would
do
so.
in
other
words,
the
federal
courts
are
to
give
the
same
preclusive
effect
to
a
state
judgment
that
the
state
would.
in
thomas
versus
washington
gas,
the
court
noted
that
this
means
that
it
is
the
state
that
determines
the
extraterritorial
effect
of
its
judgments,
but
out
of
practical
necessity,
it
must
do
so
indirectly
by
prescribing
the
effect
of
those
judgments
within
the
state.
in
this
instance,
then,
the
court,
the
federal
court
must
determine
whether
illinois,
in
view
of
the
final
judgments
which
it
has
rendered,
would
preclude
further
litigation
between
these
parties
as
a
result
of
the
denial
of
the
membership
application.
the
illinois
law
of
res
judicata
provides
that
final
judgments
by
a
court
of
competent--
mr.
d.
kendall
griffith
--the
plurality
opinions
did,
your
honor.
judge
flamm
discussed
the
illinois
law
in
great
extent.
mr.
d.
kendall
griffith
i
cannot
cite
any
case
which
says
the
opposite,
your
honor.
it
has
been
represented
here
that
illinois
has
a
jurisdictional
competency
requirement.
that
representation,
we
submit,
is
not
correct.
and
it
is
the
result
of
taking
words
out
of
the
illinois
definition
of
res
judicata
and
other
words
out
of
the
language
describing
the
difference
between
claim
preclusion
and
issue
preclusion
and
twisting
them.
the
first
language
that
is
used
is
the
illinois
requirement
that
the
final
judgment
be
by
a
court
of
competent
jurisdiction.
it
is
referring
to
the
first
court's
jurisdiction
to
hear
the
first
action,
and
the
reason
for
that
requirement
is
simple.
if
the
first
court
didn't
have
jurisdiction,
that
judgment
is
null
and
void.
a
null
and
void
judgment
can
be
collaterally
attacked,
and
collateral
attack,
preventing
collateral
attack
is
what
res
judicata
is
all
about.
now,
on
the
other
hand,
as
the
court
knows,
there
are
two
branches
of
preclusion,
claim
and
issue.
and
they
are
distinguished
by
most
courts
by
saying
that
claim
preclusion
precludes
not
only
what
was
litigated,
but
what
could
have
litigated.
what
they
are
talking
about
there
is
not,
we
submit,
subject
matter
jurisdiction,
because
most
res
judicata
cases
and
the
cases
in
which
that
language
was
generated
are
two
cases
filed
in
the
same
court.
the
jurisdictions
were
the
same,
but
what
they
are
saying
is
just
what
happened
in
the
phelps
case
that
mr.
murdock
cited
to
the
court.
if
the
second
claim
hadn't
matured,
or
if
you
had
a
continuing
tort
and
the
second
claim
involved
actions
which
took
place
after
the
first
suit,
that
is
something
that
could
not
have
been
raised
in
the
first
suit.
in
the
phelps
case,
they
were
talking
hypothetically,
saying
that
if
the
case
had
been
tried
before
this
statute
that
was
relied
on
in
the
second
case
was
enacted
then
that
matter
couldn't
have
been
raised
in
that
first
case
because
the
statute
wasn't
in
existence.
in
other
words,
that
cause
of
action
was
premature.
a
fact
necessary
for
it
wasn't
in
existence.
so,
there
is
no
jurisdictional
competency
requirement.
what
they
are
doing
is
saying
there
is
a
jurisdictional
competency
requirement,
and
furthermore
we
are
going
to
measure
it
not
from
when
the
cause
of
action
accrues
and
when
the
party
makes
a
decision
as
to
whether
he
is
going
to
sue,
where
he
is
going
to
sue,
what
he
is
going
to
sue
for,
but
you
measure
it
after
he
has
made
that
choice,
after
he,
as
mr.
justice
potter
stewart
said,
has
made
the
choice.
it
isn't
the
court
that
made
the
choice
here.
it
is
the
plaintiffs.
they
chose
to
sue
in
illinois.
if
you
let
a
plaintiff...
if
you
measure
that
from
after
the
time
the
plaintiff
has
made
the
choice
of
where
he
is
going
to
sue
and
selected
the
forum,
you
can
always
in
exclusive
jurisdiction
matters,
if
he
has
got
two
claims
cut
of
that
single
event,
one
of
them
is
within
the
exclusive
jurisdiction
of
some
court,
and
others
are
common
law,
which
he
can
bring
in
another
court
by
waiting
to
measure
could
have
been
brought
until
after
he
sues
he
can
always
claim
split.
he
can
always
ensure
himself
of
multiple
litigation
of
a
single
event.
mr.
d.
kendall
griffith
well,
that...
maybe
i
don't
understand,
but
if
you
decide
that
1738
doesn't
apply,
that--
mr.
d.
kendall
griffith
--oh,
i
am
sorry.
does
apply.
i
submit,
justice
white,
that
you
don't
have
to
do
that,
because
as
i
said,
i
think
judge
flamm--
mr.
d.
kendall
griffith
--defined...
i
think
the
plurality
opinions
defined
what
the
illinois
claim
preclusion
law
is.
mr.
d.
kendall
griffith
he
did
not
write
the
plurality.
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
d.
kendall
griffith
he
said
that
the
illinois
law
would
bar
further
litigation
in
illinois
between
these
parties
resulting
from
the--
mr.
d.
kendall
griffith
--that's
right,
that's
right,
because
this
is
one...
the
action...
the
language
could
not
have
been
raised.
you
really
only
apply
that
when
you
are
trying
to
decide
whether
it
is
claim
preclusion
or
issue
preclusion.
mr.
d.
kendall
griffith
five
to
four.
mr.
d.
kendall
griffith
that's...
yes,
i
think
that
is
true.
mr.
d.
kendall
griffith
no,
i
think
1738
is
applicable,
and
i
think
if
you
apply
it--
mr.
d.
kendall
griffith
--that's
correct.
mr.
d.
kendall
griffith
i
think
you
are
right,
your
honor,
because
judge--
mr.
d.
kendall
griffith
--well,
we
know
what
judge
flamm
would
say.
mr.
d.
kendall
griffith
that
is
one
out
of
five.
mr.
d.
kendall
griffith
that's
true.
if
1738
does
apply,
as
we
understand
allen
and
kremer
and
the
other
cases,
you
are
not
really
concerned,
though,
with
whether
this
could
have
been
raised
in
illinois.
you
are
concerned
with
what
effect
illinois
would
give
that
judgment.
once
that
is
determined,
you
take
that
effect
and
apply
it
in
the
federal
court.
the
effect
in
illinois
is
to
preclude
further
litigation
between
the
petitioners
and
the
respondent
over
the
rejection
of
this
membership
application.
that
is
the
effect.
this
is
a
suit
between
the
petitioners
and
the
respondent.
it
involves
a
rejection
of
the
membership
application.
it
would
be
precluded...
that
is
what
illinois
precludes,
further
litigation
on
that.
therefore
this
court
or
the
federal
courts
must
give
the
same
effect.
mr.
d.
kendall
griffith
it
was
about
three
or
four
days
before.
mr.
d.
kendall
griffith
that
is
correct.
that
is
why
judge
posner
went
on
the
proposition
that
you
need
more.
mr.
d.
kendall
griffith
that's
right.
i
was
going
to
say,
your
honor,
i
am
here
now.
0
[generallaughter.]
mr.
d.
kendall
griffith
well,
no,
obviously,
i
would
like
to
see
the
case
decided
now
along
the
lines
i
have
said,
although
i
am
not
really
fearful
of
that.
i
think
that
when
migra
and
these
cases
are
examined,
along
with
the
illinois
law
of
claim
preclusion,
this
is
where
we
are
going
to
come
out.
mr.
d.
kendall
griffith
because
of
exclusive
jurisdiction?
mr.
d.
kendall
griffith
all
right.
i
do
not
frankly
understand
that
at
all,
and
i
guess
it
is
because
i--
mr.
d.
kendall
griffith
--i
think
that
there
is
an
interest.
obviously
there
is
an
interest
because
exclusive
jurisdiction
was
granted,
but
i
think
you
have
to
look
at
what
is,
just
what
does
that
mean,
and
i
submit
that
it
means
that
if
an
antitrust
action
is
filed,
and
if
it
is
maintainable,
then
it
must
be
filed
and
maintained
in
the
u.s.
district
court.
it
does
not
mean
that
every
antitrust
claim
must
be
filed.
that
decision
still
rests
with
the
individual
antitrust
claimant,
and
if
he
never
files
it,
and
of
course
once
he
makes
his
decision
he
has
to
accept
the
consequences.
if
he
never
files
it,
he
never
has
antitrust
relief.
if
he
files
it
but
he
delays
too
long
for
some
reason
and
the
statute
of
limitations
has
run,
he
does
not
have
and
cannot
get
antitrust.
the
exclusive
jurisdiction
does
not
mean
that
it
must
be
maintained,
or
the
courts
must
entertain
it
once
it
comes
to
them.
mr.
d.
kendall
griffith
that's
correct.
the
purposes
of
exclusive
jurisdiction,
that
is
one
of
them,
to
give
him
the
advantage
of
the
discovery
procedures
in
the
federal
court,
the
rules
of
evidence,
the
experience
and
expertise
of
the
federal
bar
in
antitrust,
and
to
provide
uniform
enforcement.
now,
all
of
these
things
relate
to
facilitating
the
prosecution
and
defense
of
an
antitrust
case.
they
all
take
place,
and
once
a
decision
is
made
to
file
they
all
apply
to
actions
that
it
was
decided
to
present,
and
if
the
claimant
decides
not
to
file
that
action,
none
of
those
reasons
really
are
there.
they
are
not
important.
and
the
failure
to
file
doesn't
frustrate
any
of
those
purposes.
on
the
other
hand,
if
in
this
instance
the
claim
is
not
precluded,
then
the
purposes
of
finality
of
judgment
in
1738
are
frustrated,
because
you
have
multiple
litigation
of
a
single
event.
the
respondent
must
defend
a
second
time
the
claim
that
the
rejection
of
membership
was
wrongful.
a
second
court
must
entertain
that
action,
and
this
is
what
claim
preclusion,
finality
of
judgments
is
all
about.
their
purposes
will
be
frustrated
if
this
claim
is
not
precluded.
the
purposes
of
exclusive
jurisdiction
will
not
be.
those
all
relate
to
what
happens
if
a
claimant
decides
to
file.
here,
the
petitioners
were
the
plaintiffs
in
the
state
court.
this
was
their
decision.
they
chose.
with
respect
to
the
argument
of
mr.
murdock
regarding
the
interests
of
the
attorneys
general,
if
they
are
dragged
into
federal
court,
then
you
have
party
reversal,
and
that
is
not
this
case.
that
presents
another
problem
when
someone
is
coerced
into
a
jurisdiction,
and
he
himself
has
a
claim
that
is
within
the
exclusive
jurisdiction
of
another
forum.
the
state
is
either
talking
about
that
or
they
are
talking
about
their
own
election
to
go
to
federal
court
first,
and
then
they
are
afraid
that
they
will
be
precluded
from
having
their
state
forum.
well,
again,
that
is
their
choice.
if
they,
on
the
other
hand,
are
made
a
defendant
in
a
federal
action,
and
they
are
worried
about
preclusion
then
of
their
state
action
that
they
would
be
bringing
in
the
state
as
plaintiff,
there
you
have
party
reversal.
that
is
not
this
case.
mr.
d.
kendall
griffith
well,
in
this
situation...
in
other
words,
you
are
supposing
that
after
the
petitioners
file
this
action
in
federal
court,
that
the
state
then
wanted
to
join
it
for
some
reason.
mr.
d.
kendall
griffith
well,
i
am
not
so
sure,
in
view
of
what
the
court
said
in
migra,
that
they
can't
go
in
two
courts.
the
problem
here,
of
course,
is
that
the
petitioners
waited
until
they
had
a
final
judgment
in
the
state
court,
and
then
they
brought
a
successive
suit.
they
didn't
bring
a
current
suit.
and
as
the
court
noted
in
migra,
if
a
party
files
a
state
action
and
a
federal
action,
he
can
preserve
the
federal
action
if
the
state
action
is
decided
first
by
indicating
that
he
is
reserving
his
right
to
proceed
or
his
federal
claim
in
the
federal
court.
so,
i
think
the
options
here
are
not
just
filing
in
the
federal
court
and
invoking
pendent
jurisdiction.
the
dismissal
in
state
court
can
be
without
prejudice
to
the
claim
which
is
already
pending
and
filed
prior
to
the
final
judgment.
mr.
d.
kendall
griffith
well--
mr.
d.
kendall
griffith
--that's
true.
mr.
d.
kendall
griffith
unless,
of
course,
that
was...
but
that
is
what
claim
preclusion
is
all
about,
i
submit,
your
honor.
we
unfortunately
don't
always
get
to
have
everything.
mr.
d.
kendall
griffith
yes,
and
i
think
another
effect
is--
mr.
d.
kendall
griffith
--that's
correct,
but
that
they
could
do
before
this
decision,
and
i
think
it
also
means
that
probably
it
will
encourage
more
antitrust
because
they
will
not
feel
that
they
can
wait,
and
they
will
make
that
decision
in
a
timely
way.
