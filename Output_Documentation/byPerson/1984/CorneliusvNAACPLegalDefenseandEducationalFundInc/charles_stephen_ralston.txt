mr.
charles
stephen
ralston
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
it
is
also
respondent's
position
that
the
issue
presented
by
this
case
is
a
narrow
and
specific
one.
we
would
state
that
issue
somewhat
differently,
however.
and
our
statement
of
the
issue
is,
can
the
government
prohibit
charitable
organizations
from
participating
in
the
solicitation
of
federal
employees
for
donations
of
their
money
because,
number
one,
those
organizations
use
litigation
to
obtain
health
and
welfare
benefits
for
their
clientele,
and
two,
because
some
federal
employees
find
such
organizations
controversial
or
objectionable
on
some
basis
or
other.
and
i
think
to
frame
that
issue
i
would
like
to
emphasize
a
few
key
facts
that
are
well
established
by
this
record.
first
of
all,
the
only
thing
at
issue
in
this
case
is
access
of
the
respondent
to
designated
funds.
there
are
two
types
of
moneys
obtained
in
the
combined
federal
campaign.
undesignated
is
money
that
is
put
into
a
general
pot
to
be
distributed.
designated
funds
are
money
that
particular
federal
employees
decide
freely,
voluntarily,
on
their
own
to
give
to
a
particular
organization.
that
is
all
any
of
the
respondents
get
is
money
that
federal
employees
want
to
give
us.
second,
tens
of
thousands
of
federal
employees
have
given
the
respondents
in
excess
of
$1
million
in
the
time
period
that
we
have
been
in
the
combined
federal
campaign,
again,
freely
and
voluntarily.
the
third
fact
is
that
the
respondents
do
in
fact
provide
health
and
welfare
services,
and
the
government
really
has
never
contested
that.
the
record
is
replete,
as
was
held
the
first
time
this
entire
issue
was
litigated,
with
examples
of
the
health
and
welfare
services
we
supply,
and
i
will
come
back
to
describe
some
of
those
in
a
moment.
the
only
basis,
the
only
basis
for
excluding
us,
and
really
the
proper
term
is
expelling
us
after
we
had
been
in
the
campaign,
is
that
we
accomplish
these
goals
through
litigation,
litigation
activities
which
this
court
has
held
are
at
the
core
of
the
first
amendment.
we
are
not
political
actions
organizations.
we
do
not
do
lobbying
activities.
some
of
us
don't
do
any
at
all.
the
rest
do
whatever
lobbying
or
legislative
activities
as
what
any
charitable
organization
can
do.
the
record
is
clear
on
that.
and
the
solicitor
general
has
referred
the
court
to
the
letters
that
are
in
the
record
which
provided
the
impetus
for
our
expulsion
and
i
agree,
these
letters
should
be
read
because
they
are
replete
with
misinformation
and
a
misunderstanding
of
what
we
do.
there
are
charges
that
we
are
political
organizations,
that
we
aren't
charities
at
all.
these
facts
are
simply
wrong,
and
this
was
the
main
basis
for
the
opposition.
the
fifth
point
is
that
the
respondents
have
at
all
times
sought
to
participate
in
the
combined
federal
campaign,
a
forum
that
it
establishes
in
ways
totally
compatible
with
that
forum
and
fully
in
accord
with
the
regulations
that
set
it
up.
we
are
not
seeking
to
wander
the
halls
of
government
buttonholing
federal
employees.
we
simply
want
to
do
the
same
things
that
other
organizations
are
allowed
to
do,
which
is
to
have
under
the
regulations
here
in
question
our
names
and
30-word
statements
in
the
brochures,
and
we
have
reproduced
in
the
appendix
to
our
brief
a
couple
of
these
brochures.
that
is
what
is
at
issue,
whether
we
can
get
that
information
before
federal
employees,
and
whatever
other
free
speech
activities
are
allowed
by
the
particular
local
combined
federal
campaign,
to
get
that
information
before
federal
employees
when
they
are
deciding
whether
they
will
give
them
money
at
all,
whether
they
will
designate
it,
and
if
designating
it,
to
whom
they
will
designate,
to
whom
they
will
give
their
money.
and
this
campaign,
these
methods
that
the
government
has
set
up
and
which
we
do
not
contest,
are
the
only
way
to
reach
federal
employees
effectively
as
an
audience.
there
are
no
equivalent
alternatives.
the
courts
below
in
a
series
of
cases
held
that,
and
to
urge
that
direct
mail,
for
example,
is
just
as
good
is
simply
inaccurate
from
a
fundraising
point
of
view.
the
state
of
new
york,
for
example,
in
its
amicus
brief
has
pointed
out
one
of
the
great
advantages
of
this
method
of
raising
funds
is
that
it
maximizes
the
funds
available
for
the
charitable
activities
of
the
organizations
themselves.
mr.
charles
stephen
ralston
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
stephen
ralston
yes,
your
honor,
in
recent
campaigns
there
has
been
approximately
60
to
65
percent.
before
the
changes
in
1982,
there
was
no
encouragement
to
designate.
so
approximately
65
percent
of
the
funds
were
undesignated.
however,
in
1982,
the
government,
when
it
changed
the
regulations,
encouraged
designations,
and
in
the
past
years
the
predominant
amount
of
money
has
been
through
designation.
again,
we
only
get
designated
funds,
that
is,
money
that
people
want
to
give
to
us
as
individual
organizations.
the
final
point
is,
as
the
district
court
found,
based
on
what
the
government
put
in
the
record,
the
motivation
for
expelling
us
from
the
campaign
was
controversy.
there
were
some
federal
employees
who
didn't
think
we
should
be
in.
they
were
opposed
to
our
continued
inclusion,
and
the
government
acquiesced
to
that
and
ejected
us
from
the
campaign.
i
think
it
is
also
important
to
focus
on
exactly
what
the
rule
is
that
keeps
us
out,
because
the
government
has
talked
a
lot
about
having
to
draw
lines.
our
position
is,
the
line
that
is
drawn
is
simply
an
unconstitutional
one.
we
are
excluded,
and
all
elements
of
the
rule
result
in
our
exclusion,
number
one,
because
we
litigate,
number
two,
because
our
litigation
consumes
in
excess
of
15
percent
of
our
budgets
and/or
$1
million,
three,
we
litigate
on
behalf
of
others,
and
four,
we
are
selective
in
our
litigation.
that
is,
the
cases
we
select
are
related
to
particular
causes.
if
any
one
of
these
isn't
present,
we
would
be
in.
for
example,
legal
aid
societies
which
expend
100
percent
or
close
to
it
of
their
budgets
for
the
purposes
of
litigation
are
accepted
into
the
combined
federal
campaing.
they
have
been
for
a
long
time.
mr.
charles
stephen
ralston
your
honor,
if
they
are
charitable
activities,
such
as
to
qualify
them
generally,
if
they
qualified
as
a
501(c)(3)
organization
and
met
the
other
various
provisions
that
are
in
the
regulations,
they
might
be
able
to
qualify.
i
am
not
that
familiar
with
what
they
do.
mr.
charles
stephen
ralston
the
aclu
foundation,
which
is
their
tax-exempt
arm
of
the
aclu,
would
be
able
to
come
in
in
the
same
way
that
the
naacp
special
contribution
fund
is
in
the
campaign.
mr.
charles
stephen
ralston
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
stephen
ralston
under
the
present
system,
or
the
system
that
existed
that
is
in
issue
here,
the
undesignated
money
goes
to
a
private
organization
which
has
been
designated
the
principal
combined
fundraising
organization.
in
virtually
every
instance
it
is
the
local
chapter
of
the
united
way.
united
way
then
decides
among
the
participating
organizations
how
to
divide
up
the
undesignated
moneys,
but
we
do
not
get
any
of
that.
mr.
charles
stephen
ralston
not
under
the
formulas
as
i
understand
them.
it
is
simply...
there
used
to
be
under
the
system
before
1982
a
rather
complex
mathematical
formula,
but
the
way
the
system
works
now
is,
the
pcfc,
which
again
in
practical
effect
is
the
local
united
way
branch,
decides
based
on
its
assessment
of
local
needs.
again,
we
don't
get
any
of
that.
mr.
charles
stephen
ralston
because
the
district
court
held
that
the
rule
that
we
are
challenging
was
only
unconstitutional
as
it
related
to
getting
designated
funds,
and
essentially
said,
if
we
felt
we
were
being
wrongfully
denied
undesignated
funds,
we
could
challenge
that
under
the
equal
protection
claim.
we
had
challenged
the
prior
undesignated
funds
system
in
naacp
legal
defense
fund
number
two.
this
is
actually
the
third
in
a
series
of
cases.
we
lost
that.
we
did
not
appeal,
primarily
because
we
felt
that
since
the
focus
of
the
campaign
had
shifted
almost
primarily
to
designated
funds,
that
was
a
primary
issue.
we
have
essentially
acquiesced
in
our--
mr.
charles
stephen
ralston
--yes.
that
is
the
basis
on
which
the
district
court
decided
the
case.
we
did
not
appeal,
and
that
is
binding
on
us.
we
do
not
challenge
that
in
any
way.
mr.
charles
stephen
ralston
well,
basically,
your
honor,
the
formula--
mr.
charles
stephen
ralston
--we
thought
we
might
lose,
and
quite
frankly,
it
began
to
become
de
minimis,
because
when
we
first
challenged
it,
65
percent
of
the
funds
were
undesignated.
it
has
now
shifted
heavily
to
a
designated
program,
which
we
think
is
the
right
kind
of
program.
let
me
continue
with
some
examples
of
some
other
organizations
that
are
in,
and
we
are
out.
i
mentioned
the
naacp
special
contribution
fund,
which
is
a
separate
organization
from
the
lead
respondent
here.
they
do
exactly
the
same
kind
of
litigation
that
we
do.
it
is
just
apparently
they
do
it
less
than
15
percent
of
their
budget.
another
example
of
the
way
we
are
excluded
even
though
organizations
which
do
the
same
thing
or
get
the
same
results
are
included,
we
are
the
only
category
of
organizations
excluded
because
we
focus
on
a
particular
cause.
american
cancer
society
is
in.
various
health
agencies
that
focus
on
a
particular
issue
are
in.
the
regulations,
and
i
would
refer
the
court
to
again
our
appendix,
page
37a,
which
contains
the
definitions
of
the
agencies
which
are
included
under
the
executive
order,
permit
in
organizations
that
provide
for
the
care
and
treatment
of
prisoners,
a
specific
category,
a
specific
cause.
the
record
again
establishes,
without
contradiction
from
the
government
whatsoever,
that
because
of
litigation
brought
by
the
naacp
legal
defense
fund,
$20
million
has
been
spent
in
the
state
of
georgia
to
build
medical
care
and
mental
health
care
facilities
for
prisoners
in
the
state
of
georgia,
and
another
$46
million
spent
to
totally
rehabilitate
the
main
prison
there.
we
would
submit
that
these
are
exactly
the
kinds
of
benefits,
services
to
prisoners
that
the
regulations
contemplate
that
other
organizations
provide.
the
only
reason
we
are
out
is
because
we
do
it
through
litigation.
the
government's
reasons--
mr.
charles
stephen
ralston
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
stephen
ralston
your
honor,
that
is
basically
the
government's
controversy
argument,
and
our
first
position
would
be--
mr.
charles
stephen
ralston
--yes.
well,
as
a
result
of
their
opposition
to
us
being
in,
they
don't
want
to
contribute
at
all.
mr.
charles
stephen
ralston
yes,
and
as
the
planned
parenthood
amicus
brief
establishes,
it
provides
health
services
of
exactly
the
kind
that
other
organizations
are
in,
and
in
fact
the
record
in
that
case
establishes
that
the
petitioner
attempted
to
keep
him
out
because
he
didn't
like
them
along
with
other
organizations
didn't
like
them.
but
they
were
attempted
to
be
kept
out
because
they
were
too
controversial,
even
though
their
services
were
clearly
within
the
scope
of
these
regulations,
and
that
is
what
the
district
court
so
found,
and
again,
i
refer
the
court
to
the
planned
parenthood
amicus
brief,
which
describes
that
entire
incident.
our
basic
position
is
that
the
fact
that
some
people
think
that
we
shouldn't
be
in
is
essentially
legally
irrelevant
and
in
fact
a
constitutionally
unacceptable
reason
for
ejecting
us.
plus
the
fact
that
unless
one
accepts
the
government's
view
that
the
reasons
given
have
to
be
simply
accepted
with
no
review
of
them
whatsoever,
which
is
what
i
now
understand
their
position
to
be,
the
notion
that
because
we
are
in
created
such
great
controversy
that
the
combined
federal
campaign
was
on
the
verge
of
destruction
simply
has
no
support
in
this
record
at
all.
and
i
would
like
to
recount
briefly
the
precise
history
of
our
involvement
in
the
combined
federal
campaign.
the
government
in
its
brief
simply
leaves
out
a
very
important
piece
of
it.
in
1980,
three
organizations
that
were
basically
legal
organizations
applied,
the
special
contribution
fund
of
the
naacp,
which
is
a
separate
organization,
puerto
rico
legal
defense
fund,
and
the
naacp
legal
defense
fund.
the
special
contribution
fund
was
let
in.
we
were
excluded
under
the
direct
services
rule,
basically
on
the
ground
that
we
weren't
legal
aid
societies.
if
we
were,
we
were
in.
because
we
weren't,
they
said
we
were
out.
we
brought
an
action.
judge
gesell
not
simply
that
that
provision
was
vague,
but
that
the
direct
services
rule
was
inconsistent
with
the
executive
order
enacted
in
1961
by
president
kennedy
which
the
government
relies
on
in
giving
a
continuous
history
of
20
years
of
everybody
understanding
what
it
meant.
all
i
can
say
is,
i
didn't
understand
the
executive
order
to
exclude
us,
nor
did
the
regulations
exclude
us.
i
didn't
even
understand
the
direct
services
rule
to
exclude
us.
judge
gesell
found
that
the
direct
services
rule,
which
has
basically
been
resurrected
by
the
government
now,
was
inconsistent
with
the
executive
order
because
the
executive
order
was
not
limited
to
health
and
welfare
agencies.
it
stated
health,
welfare,
and
other
appropriate
agencies.
in
1981,
we
were
all
let
in,
or
five
of
us,
excuse
me,
were
let
in
because
the
government
said
they
didn't
have
time
to
try
to
redo
the
regulations.
late
in
1981,
they
proposed...
opm
proposed
to
the
president
a
new
executive
order
which
would
be
very
similar
to
the
executive
order
and
regulations
that
are
here
at
issue
which
would
exclude
us.
the
president
did
not
adopt
that
executive
order.
rather,
he
enacted
a
superseding
executive
order
which
retained
exactly
the
language
that
judge
gizzell
had
held
did
not
exclude
us,
health,
welfare,
and
other
appropriate
agencies.
the
government
then
issued
regulations
that
specifically
included
us,
not
under
court
order,
but
under
the
provisions
of
the
president's
new
executive
order,
and
announced
that
it
had
decided
to
remove
any
doubt
of
our
being
able
to
participate
by
stating
that
we
were
entitled
to
be
in
as
health,
welfare,
and/or
other
appropriate
agencies.
so,
we
were
in,
and
the
other
two
respondents
came
in,
along
with
some
other
legal
defense
funds.
now,
between
1979,
the
year...
i'm
sorry,
1980,
the
year
before
any
of
us
were
in
the
combined
federal
campaign,
and
1983,
when
all
of
us
were
in,
receipts
from
the
combined
federal
campaign
rose
from
$87
million
to
$109
million.
that
is
an
increase
of
25
percent.
the
government
says,
well,
the
level
of
participation
went
down,
but
again,
in
the
year
before
any
of
us
were
in,
that
is,
1980,
59
percent
of
federal
employees
gave.
the
first
year
any
of
us
were
in,
1981,
when
five
of
us
were
admitted,
receipts
went
up,
and
60
percent
of
federal
employees
gave.
there
was
no
controversy
in
1981.
the
government
has
produced
no
letters
from
anybody
complaining
about
the
fact
that
we
were
in.
1982,
there
was
a
controversy
engendered
almost
exclusively
because
one
particular
organization
came
in,
and
our
position
is
that
the
government
could
have
taken
reasonable
steps
to
deal
with
that
controversy
including
informing
the
people
who
were
writing
the
letters
that
they
had
all
their
facts
wrong,
which
was
in
fact
they
case.
they
didn't.
they
simply
said,
all
right,
we
are
now
going
to
change
our
mind
and
throw
all
these
legal
defense
funds
back
out.
so
it
is
simply
not
accurate
to
state
that
there
is
this
historical
understanding
that
everybody
always
had
that
traditional
charities,
whatever
that
term
is
supposed
to
mean,
were
the
only
ones
ever
intended
to
be
in
the
combined
federal
campaign.
mr.
charles
stephen
ralston
well,
your
honor,
i
don't
understand
quite
what
traditional
means.
if
it
means
organizations
that
serve
as
conduits
of
money
from
one
group
to
another,
if
one
looks
at
the
list,
primarily
such
organizations
are
in.
but
legal
aid
societies,
for
example,
were
in
as
subagencies
of
local
united
ways,
and
this
was
why
when
we
applied
in
1980,
and
were
told,
well,
you
would
be
in
if
you
were
a
legal
aid
society,
and
you
are
out
because
you
are
not,
and
that
is
because
we
don't
provide
direct
services,
we
didn't
understand
that
at
all,
quite
frankly.
i
still
don't
understand
the
attempted
distinction,
among
others,
between
us
and
legal
aid
societies,
since
whatever
we
do,
we
do
through
litigation.
so,
this
concept
of
traditional
charities
and
the
notion
that
somebody
had
that
in
mind
all
along,
even
if
it
can
be
defined,
which
i
contend
it
cannot
be
define,
is
circular
anyway,
because
it
still
doesn't
get
around
to
the
question
of
whether
assuming
such
a
restriction
existed,
whether
it
was
a
reasonable
restriction.
the
government
also
relies
on
the
argument
relating
to
appearance
of
impartiality.
of
course,
we
think
the
government
should
be
impartial
also,
but
it
is
not
being
impartial.
it
is
essentially
saying,
look,
we
think
there
are
some
agencies
that
are
really
worthwhile,
some
agencies
that
aren't
so
worthwhile,
and
we
don't
want
federal
employees
even
to
be
able
to
think
about
giving
to
the
agencies
that
we
don't
think
should
get
the
money,
so
we
are
not
going
to
let
even
their
names
or
30
words
be
before
the
federal
employees.
mr.
charles
stephen
ralston
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
stephen
ralston
your
honor,
we...
well,
we
have
not
relied
in
our
brief
on
a
viewpoint
argument,
although
the
government
has
always
taken
the
position
that
it
wants
us
out
because
it
doesn't
want
federal
employees
to
read
our
30
words
and
perhaps
give
us
their
money,
so
in
a
way
that
is
an
attempt
to
express
the
expression
of
our
views,
our
ideas
as
to
how
their
money
should
be
spent.
mr.
charles
stephen
ralston
there
are...
well,
to
begin
with,
i
will
answer
your
question,
but
my
first
point
would
be,
and
i
would
like
to
reemphasize
it,
assuming
a
line
needs
to
be
drawn,
the
line
they
have
drawn
here
is
an
unconstitutional
one.
that
is
our
fundamental
position.
the
second
position
is
that
before
the
government
draws
a
line
which
is
going
to
result
in
excluding,
denying
people
first
amendment
rights,
and
the
government
does,
i
think,
concede
that
the
first
amendment
has
something
to
do
with
this
case,
there
has
to
be
a
reason
for
that
exclusion.
and
if
one
looks
at
how
the
combined
federal
campaign
works,
the
need
for
drawing
a
lot
of
very
strict
lines
and
excluding
groups
is
not
at
all
clear.
in
the
first
place,
everything
is
on
the
local
level,
550
approximately
local
combined
federal
campaigns.
agencies
that
are
part
of
the
united
way
get
in
through
the
united
way.
that
is
something
around,
over
30,000
agencies.
the
line
the
government
has
drawn
here
out
of
this
alleged
universe
of
300,000
organizations
excludes
40,
maybe
100
organizations.
it
simply
is
not
a
line
designed
to
limit
the
number
of
organizations.
now,
there
are
some
lines
that
i
think
are
perfectly
reasonable,
501(c)(3)
organizations,
organizations
that
seek
contributions
from
the
public,
because
after
all,
the
combined
federal
campaign
is
an
attempt
to
get
contributions
from
the
public.
that
would
exclude
private
foundations.
it
would
exclude
many
private
schools,
for
example,
which
don't
seek
money
from
the
public
generally.
churches,
political...
actual
political
action
groups,
which
of
course
are
not
501(c)(3)
organizations
anyway,
i
think
could
be
reasonably
excluded
on
the
same
grounds
that
this
court
has
upheld
in
the
hatch
act,
for
example.
getting
government
employees
directly
involved
in
political
activities
could
be
a
problem.
there
are
many
church-related
charities
in
the
combined
federal
campaign.
if
one
looks
at
the
list
that
we
have
provided,
you
will
see
many
organizations,
catholic
charities,
unitarian
charities
are
in
the
campaign.
actual
churches
per
se
are
not.
i
don't
have
any
idea
whether
any
have
applied
or
any
ever
will
apply.
they
could
be
excluded,
i
would
think,
if
the
government
had
to
do
it,
could
be
excluded
on
the
grounds
that
this
might
be
too
direct
support
to
the
establishment
of
religion,
but
again,
the
government
has--
mr.
charles
stephen
ralston
--your
honor,
i
don't
say
that.
i
am
trying
to
respond
to
if
a
line
had
to
be
drawn,
could
some
lines
be
drawn.
i
am
simply
suggesting
that
there
may
be
some
reasonable
lines.
i
don't
feel,
and
this
relates
to
the
government's
subsidy
argument,
that
sort
of
comes
up
and
then
disappears
from
time
to
time,
that
the
combined
federal
campaign
is
really
a
subsidy
or
direct
support.
again,
it
is
an
attempt
to
get
people,
individuals
to
decide
to
whom
to
give
their
money.
i
don't
really...
our
basic
position
is
that
no
necessity
for
drawing
a
line
here
has
been
shown,
and
there
has
really
been
no
necessity
shown
to
draw
any
particular
line
because
there
is
no
real
indication
of
any
inundation,
that
there
are
so
many
charities
that
are
in
fact
going
to
apply
that
it
is
going
to
overwhelm
the
campaign
at
all.
the
health
and
welfare
line
generally,
if
it
could
be
defined
in
a
way
that
related
to
some
government
purpose,
might
be
a
possible
line
if
it
was
necessary
to
draw
one.
mr.
charles
stephen
ralston
yes,
the
reason
given
in
the
district
court,
and
this
was
the
main
defense
of
the
government
in
the
district
court,
was
the
controversy,
that
they
got
all
these
letters
from
people
complaining
about
the
fact
legal
defense
funds
or
these
political
organizations--
mr.
charles
stephen
ralston
--that
is
what
the
district
court
so
found,
and
we
believe
that
is
the
only
reason
that
makes
any
sense
to
us.
none
of
the
other
reasons
do.
mr.
charles
stephen
ralston
that
it
is
not
only
inadequate,
it
is
an
unconstitutional
reason.
our
position
would
be
that
our
first
amendment
rights
cannot
be
denied
because
someone
out
there
doesn't
want
us
to
exercise
them.
and
again,
the
whole
point
of
this,
the
attempted
exclusion,
is
so
that
our
names
and
our
30
words
will
be
removed
from
the
brochures.
that
is
what
the
exclusion
amounts
to.
mr.
charles
stephen
ralston
pardon
me,
your
honor?
mr.
charles
stephen
ralston
your
honor,
they
are
not
a
charitable
organization,
and
that
simply
is
not
at
issue.
we
would
have
no...
i
think
the
government
could
draw
a
line--
mr.
charles
stephen
ralston
--that
is
true,
your
honor,
but--
mr.
charles
stephen
ralston
--your
honor
we
do
not
contend
that
the
government,
having
opened
up
with,
we
contend,
which
we
urge
first
is
a
limited
public
forum,
a
forum
for
the
specific
purpose
of
charitable
solicitation,
then
as
required
to
under
the
decisions
of
this
court,
open
it
up
to
any
type
of
solicitation.
the
socialist
party
is
not
a
charity.
its
involvement
in
a
forum
which
is
dedicated
to
charitable
solicitation
would
be
totally
incompatible
with
the
purposes
of
that
forum.
in
our
brief,
we
have
pointed
out
that
our
basic
position
is
that
this
is
a
limited
public
forum,
and
we
have
also
said,
assuming
that
it
isn't,
is
not
a
public
forum,
we
have
essentially
taken
on
the
government,
as
it
states
its
case,
that
the
bases
for
our
exclusion
are
not
reasonable
anyway.
but
our
contention
is
that
this
is
a
forum
clearly
dedicated
to
charitable
solicitation.
it
is
as
if,
if
you
will,
the
government
has
set
up
two
bulletin
boards
in
the
hallway
of
a
federal
agency.
one
over
on
one
side
is
for
official
government
business.
the
one
on
the
other
side
is
labeled
charitable
solicitation,
and
the
organizations
are
allowed
to
post
a
card
with
their
30
words
on
that
bulletin
board.
that
is
all
we
want,
is
access
to
that
bulletin
board
on
the
same
basis
as
other
organizations,
free
of
distinctions
which
we
contend
are
basically
unconstitutional.
that
is
our
basic
underlying
final
contention,
that
the
government
has
used
an
unconstitutional
reason,
that
is,
the
controversy
we
have
allegedly
or
someone
has
engendered,
to
stop
a
free
speech
activity--
mr.
charles
stephen
ralston
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
stephen
ralston
that
is
right.
the
point
is
that
the
government
has...
the
reason
for
the
government's
action
is
the
controversy,
and
our
first
argument
is,
that
is
an
unconstitutional
reason.
it
cannot
justify
our
being
denied
our
first
amendment
rights
because
somebody
objects
to
our
doing
so.
mr.
charles
stephen
ralston
your
honor,
our
basic
position
is
that
even
assuming
it
is
a
nonpublic
forum
in
the
perry
analysis,
the
reasons
given
are
unreasonable
and
indeed
are
unconstitutional
reasons.
our
first
position
is
that
it
is
a
limited
public
forum,
using
the
perry
analysis.
but
even
assuming
a
nonpublic
forum,
we
still
contend
that
what
the
government
has
done
is
unconstitutional,
because
perry
makes
it
clear
that
even
a
nonpublic
forum
is
subject
to
the
first
amendment
and,
for
example,
states
that
the
government
cannot
exclude
organizations
because
they
don't
want
their
ideas
expressed.
i
mean,
that
is
the
reason
why
we
are
being
excluded.
the
government
does
not
want
our
30
words
to
get
before
the
federal
employees.
mr.
charles
stephen
ralston
no,
your
honor.
our
position
is
that
shaker
heights
was
a
forum
dedicated
to
commercial
advertising.
this
is
a
forum
dedicated
to
charitable
solicitation.
that
is
all
we
want
to
do.
we
are
the
same
kind
of
organizations
that
are
let
in.
thank
you.
