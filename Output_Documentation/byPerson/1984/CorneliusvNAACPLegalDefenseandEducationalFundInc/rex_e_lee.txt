mr.
rex
e.
lee
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
the
combined
federal
campaign
is
an
annual
effort
by
the
federal
government
to
solicit
contributions
to
charity
from
its
employees.
like
most
employers
who
engage
in
like
efforts,
the
federal
government
has
never
opened
its
campaign
to
all
categories
of
charities.
among
the
groups
who
have
never
participated
are
churches,
universities,
opera
guilds,
animal
welfare
groups,
and
other
groups,
including
the
respondents
in
this
case.
the
question
presented
here
is
whether
the
president
has
the
constitutional
authority
to
limit
participation
in
the
combined
federal
campaign
to
agencies
that
provide
or
support
direct
health
and
welfare
services
to
individuals
or
their
families.
not
included
within
the
eligible
groups
are
organizations
such
as
the
respondents,
legal
advocacy
groups
whose
objective
is
to
influence
public
policy
through
litigation.
for
the
first
19
years
of
its
existence,
the
combined
federal
campaign
did
not
include
legal
advocacy
groups
and
was
generally
understood
not
to
include
them.
the
federal
government's
practice
in
this
respect
was
also
consistent
with
the
practice
of
other
employers,
such
as
private
employers,
and
also
consistent
with
the
practices
of
federated
charitable
fundraisers
such
as
the
united
way
and
its
predecessors,
the
united
fund
and
the
old
community
chests.
in
1980,
however,
after
the
petitioner's
predecessor
had
determined
them
to
be
ineligible,
several
legal
advocacy
groups
filed
suit
in
district
court
which
held
that
the
direct
services
requirement
which
they
had
allegedly
failed
to
meet
was
unconstitutionally
vague.
the
president's
steps
taken
in
response
to
that
decision,
culminating
in
executive
order
12404,
which--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--it
was
not.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
no,
there
is
not.
the
executive
order
12404
which
was
issued
in
february,
1983,
made
explicit
that
which
had
been
the
consistent
understanding
and
practice
for
20
years,
and
i
quote
from
the
language
of
the
executive
order:
"agencies
that
seek
to
influence
the
determination
of
public
policy
through
litigation
shall
not
be
eligible
to
participate
in
the
combined
federal
campaign.
"
the
issue
in
this
case
is
remarkably
narrow.
everyone
agrees
that
the
respondent's
right
to
engage
in
fundraising
activities
is
constitutionally
protected,
and
no
one
contends
that
every
charity
should
be
constitutionally
entitled
to
participate
in
the
combined
federal
campaign.
so
that
the
problem
is
one
of
line
drawing.
who
is
to
be
admitted
and
who
is
not,
and
by
what
criteria
does
the
constitution
permit
that
distinction
to
be
made?
the
controlling
issue
as
seen
by
the
court
of
appeals,
by
the
respondents,
and
by
the
petitioner,
is
whether
drawing
the
line
where
the
president
has
drawn
it,
the
same
line
that
existed
through
five
previous
administrations,
is
reasonable.
the
respondents
and
the
court
of
appeals
are
absolutely
correct
in
our
view
in
focusing
on
reasonableness
as
the
relevant
and
controlling
constitutional
question,
and
we
will
join
them
orally,
as
we
have
in
the
briefs,
on
that
issue
as
the
issue
in
the
case.
but
i
want
to
do
so
against
the
background
that
this
necessarily
assumes
and
correctly
assumes
that
we
are
dealing
here
with
a
non-public
forum,
and
that
assumption
is
a
correct
one.
the
only
public
property,
indeed,
the
only
place
that
is
at
issue
in
this
case
is
the
federal
work
place,
which
the
federal
government
most
assuredly
has
not
opened
generally
for
expressive
activity.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
no,
it
does
not,
justice
blackmun.
it
is
simply
a
recognition
at
the
outset
that
that
is
the
correct
analytical
framework,
but
even
if
it
did
not,
we
would
contend
that
what
the
president
did
was
still
constitutional.
but
in
any
event,
there
is
general
agreement
that
the
focal
point
for
analysis
in
this
case
should
be
whether
the
president's
decision
was
feasible,
that
is,
whether
there
are
differences
between
these
respondents
and
the
combined
federal
campaign
eligible
charities
which
are
sufficiently
relevant
to
legitimate
governmental
objectives
that
the
eligibility
criteria
are
reasonable.
we
submit
that
there
is
not
only
a
reasonable
distinction,
but
that
each
of
the
three
objectives
stated
in
the
executive
order
constitutes
a
separate
and
independently
sufficient
reasonable
ground
for
sustaining
the
criteria,
and
i
will
discuss
each
of
them
separately.
first,
while
the
government's
exclusion
of
advocacy
groups
is
consistent
with
the
practice
of
employers
generally,
the
government's
involvement
in
charitable
fundraising
has
a
dimension
that
is
not
shared
by
other
employers
who
participate
in
charitable
solicitation
efforts,
and
it
is
this.
governments
have
taken
upon
themselves
the
obligation
of
caring
for
the
needs
of
the
poor,
of
assuring
that
certain
minimum
levels
of
food,
clothing,
shelter,
and
educational
opportunities
are
available.
segments
of
that
obligation
have
been
undertaken
by
the
federal
government,
and
under
those
circumstances
it
is
perfectly
proper
for
this
same
federal
government
to
make
some
reasonable
judgments
concerning
those
organizations
whose
efforts
are
most
likely
to
achieve
that
objective
and
thereby
to
minimize
the
extent
to
which
this
task
must
be
performed
by
government
itself.
it
will
not
do
in
this
respect
to
point
to
some
individual
instances
where
in
the
opinion
of
some
legal
advocacy
groups
have
in
fact
succeeded
through
litigation
in
obtaining
money
for
the
poor,
because
in
the
first
place
those
efforts
sometimes
succeed,
and
they
sometimes
yield
nothing,
but
even
more
important,
there
is
in
fact
a
difference
in
the
way
that
these
groups
go
about
performing
their
tasks.
the
eligible
groups
render
their
services
directly,
and
by
contrast,
legal
advocacy
groups
attempt
to
influence
the
action
of
other
persons
and
entities,
including
governments,
and
they
frequently
find
themselves
opposing
each
other
in
the
courts.
under
those
circumstances,
it
is
surely
reasonable,
it
is
surely
constitutionally
permissible
for
the
president
of
the
united
states
to
make
some
judgments
concerning
whether
a
dollar
given
to
a
direct
providing
traditional
charity
is
more
likely
in
general
than
a
dollar
given
to
a
public
advocacy
group
to
lessen
the
government's
overall
burden
of
providing
for
health
and
welfare.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
that
is
correct.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
well,
i
think
it
squares
completely.
that
provides
certainly
a
reasonable
basis
for
the
government
to
conclude
that
its
financial
efforts
are
better
expended
for
groups
that
provide
their
services
directly,
and
groups
for
which
there
is
at
least
a
reasonable
basis
for
the
president
to
conclude
that
they
do
a
more
direct
and
a
more
effective
job
of
lessening
the
government's
overall
health
and
welfare
burden.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
i
misunderstood
your
question,
justice
blackmun.
with
regard
to
those
two
organizations,
the
argument,
of
course,
is
an
underinclusiveness
one
that
in
applying
these
standards
we
simply
made
a
mistake
in
applying
it
to
those
two.
there
is
not
enough
in
this
record
to
make
a
determination
as
to
the
propriety
or
the
impropriety
of
the
determination
as
to
those
groups,
and
of
course
the
question
presented
in
this
case
does
not
include
whether
those
or
any
other
groups
should
or
should
not
have
been
included,
but
those
are
issues
for
other
litigation,
for
other
lawsuits
and
other
occasions
in
the
event
that--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--well,
that
they
might
have.
there
just
isn't
enough
in
this
record
to
determine
whether
they
did
or
they
did
not.
i
just
don't
know
enough.
there
isn't
enough
in
this
record
to
determine
what
the
moral
majority
and
planned
parenthood
does.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
well,
we
think
what
is
needed
here
is
a
total
reversal.
we
think
the
court
has
enough--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--we
think
it
is.
yes,
your
honor.
and
that
is
the
reason.
i
turn
next
to
the
second
objective
stated
in
the
executive
order,
which
is
to
minimize
disruption
in
the
federal
workplace,
reduce
the
costs
of
fundraising,
and
maximize
the
success
of
the
campaign.
in
other
words,
the
president,
we
submit,
could
reasonably
conclude
that
the
campaign
would
be
less
costly
and
would
raise
more
money
structured
as
he
structured
it,
and
this
borne
out
by
the
record.
the
nature,
the
tone,
and
the
magnitude
of
the
controversy
that
was
engendered
by
the
inclusion
of
these
advocacy
groups
during
the
interim
years
when
the
lower
court
orders
have
so
required,
the
difficult
barriers
that
these
create
for
those
who
attempted
to
carry
out
the
government's
fundraising
objectives
are
summarized
in
our
brief
at
pages
37
through
40.
i
would
particularly
invite
the
court's
attention
to
pages
346
through
392
of
the
joint
appendix,
which
does
give
a
fair
sample
of
the
kinds
of
problems
that
these
volunteers
who
were
charged
with
the
responsibility
of
running
the
campaign
encountered
because
of
the
inclusion
of
these
particular
groups.
now,
it
is,
of
course,
impossible
to
tell
what
the
performance
of
the
campaign
would
have
been
if
those
groups
had
been
included,
what
the
cost
would
have
been
in
terms
of
dollars
and
time,
and
how
much
money
would
have
been
raised
if
things
had
been
other
than
they
were.
but
two
things
are
very
clear.
first,
the
inclusion
of
these
groups
did
pose
widespread
and
serious
problems
in
the
judgment
of
those
who
were
charged
with
the
stewardship
of
running
the
campaign,
and
second,
and
probably
even
more
important,
precisely
because
no
one
can
make
a
comparison
of
what
was
with
what
might
have
been,
this
is
the
kind
of
decision
that
has
to
be
made
by
someone.
someone
has
to
make
those
judgments,
and
it
must
be
upheld
so
long
as
it
is
reasonable.
here
it
is
the
president
who
had
made
the
judgment,
and
it
is
consistent
with
the
judgment
of
his
five
predecessors,
and
is
clearly
reasonable.
the
respondents
rely
on
the
hecklers
veto
cases,
and
they
contend
that
their
first
amendment
rights
cannot
be
suppressed
by
those
employees
who
disagree
with
them.
their
reliance
is
misplaced
for
two
reasons.
one
is
that
none
of
their
cases
involved
a
non-public
forum.
and
in
cases
where
a
non-public
forum
was
involved,
the
potential
disruptiveness
of
the
activity
in
terms
of
disruptiveness
to
an
ongoing
governmental
activity
has
been
a
major
factor
in
upholding
constitutionality.
and
i
will
mention
just
two
cases.
one
is
the
perry
case,
in
which
the
court
found
it
relevant
that
exclusion
of
a
rival
union
from
the
school
mail
system
would
help
to
preserve
labor
peace
within
the
schools.
and
lehman
versus
city
of
shaker
heights
recognized
that
exclusion
of
political
advertising
from
mass
transit
vehicles
was
justified
in
part
because
it
would
avoid
involving
the
city
in
controversy
and
jeopardizing
its
revenues.
this
just
isn't
a
hecklers
veto
kind
of
case.
this
brings
me
to
my
second
point.
it
is
a
non-public
forum
case
in
which
the
president
has
made
some
judgments
about
the
best
way
to
enlarge
employee
involvement
in
a
fundraising
effort
while
keeping
down
the
disruptive
effects
of
that
effort.
the
third
reasonable
basis
for
the
president's
distinction
is
avoiding
both
the
reality
and
also
the
appearance
of
using
federal
resources
to
advance
a
particular
political
cause.
this
one
is
squarely
supported
by
the
court's
holding
in
lehman
versus
shaker
heights,
where
concerns
about
a
voiding
the
appearance
of
favoritism
were
held
sufficient
to
sustain
a
policy
permitting
advertising
generally
on
the
city's
buses,
but
excluding
political
candidate
advertising.
i
would
like
to
invite
the
court's
attention
now
to
one
feature
that
is
common
to
all
three
of
the
president's
objectives
and
that
i
believe
is
dispositive
of
the
issue
in
this
case.
underlying
each
of
those
objectives
is
a
presidential
resolution
of
an
issue
which
is
partially
factbound
and
whose
factual
components
cannot
be
verified
one
way
or
the
other.
it
is
not
known,
for
example,
and
cannot
be
known
whether
in
fact
health
and
welfare
organizations
that
provide
their
services
directly
have
a
greater
ameliorative
effect
on
the
total
governmental
welfare
burden
than
to
entities
such
as
these
respondents,
whose
mission
is
to
effect
public
policy
through
the
bringing
of
lawsuits.
neither
can
it
be
empirically
verified
whether
the
inclusion
of
these
groups
in
this
campaign
will
or
will
not
affect
such
things
as
the
ability
to
campaign
to
raise
money
or
its
costs
in
dollars,
employee
time
and
disruptiveness,
or
an
appearance
of
favoritism.
but
one
thing
is
clear.
this
court
has
faced
that
same
problem
in
other
cases
and
uniformly
has
accorded
governmental
officials
the
benefit
of
a
presumption
in
favor
of
their
factual
judgments.
in
perry,
for
example,
the
school
board's
judgment
was
necessarily
based
on
a
determination
that
restricting
access
to
the
mailboxes
would,
and
i
am
quoting
from
the
opinion,
"serve
to
prevent
the
district
schools
from
becoming
a
battlefield
for
interunion
squabbles.
"
and
in
lehman,
in
greer,
and
in
jones,
those
who
were
charged
with
specific
governmental
responsibilities
made
some
judgments,
some
factbound
judgments
concerning
the
likely
effect
of
their
decisions
on
such
matters
as
perceptions
of
political
favoritism
and
the
maintenance
of
discipline
within
a
military
base
or
a
penal
institution.
in
each
institution,
that
judgment
was
upheld.
under
this
court's
precedents,
therefore,
the
constitution
does
not
prohibit
a
presidential
decision
on
the
ground
that
the
factual
correctness
or
incorrectness
of
his
determination
cannot
be
verified.
i
have
just
one
final
point.
we
submit
that
this
just
isn't
a
case
in
which
there
has
been
a
first
amendment
violation
or
any
serious
implication
of
first
amendment
values.
the
significance
of
the
combined
federal
campaign
is
not
the
expressive
opportunity
that
it
offers
to
charities
to
convince
people
to
give
money
to
them.
it
offers
very
little
opportunity
for
that
kind
of
appeal,
and
there
are
in
any
event
ample
other
available
means
which
are
far
more
effective
for
that
purpose,
such
as
direct
mail,
door
to
door
solicitation,
commercial
advertising.
the
reason
that
these
respondents
or
anyone
else
would
like
to
be
included
in
the
combined
federal
campaign
is
not
because
of
opportunities
that
afford
expression,
but
rather
because
it
is
a
very
effective
money-raiser.
it
is,
in
the
respondent's
own
words,
"qualitatively
superior
to
any
other
alternative
means
of
fundraising
among
federal
workers.
"
this
just
is
not
like
the
situation,
therefore,
in
village
of
schaumburg,
where
government
has
imposed
a
negative
on
any
fundraising
efforts.
the
only
governmental
action
in
this
case
has
simply
been
to
decline
to
confer
upon
a
particular
individual
or
group
the
financial
advantage
of
a
more
effective
fundraising
opportunity.
the
court
of
appeals
attached
controlling
significance
to
the
fact
that
the
government
has
already
determined
these
petitioners
to
be
charitable
because
of
their
qualification
for
income
tax
exempt
status
under
section
501(c)(3)
of
the
internal
revenue
code.
that
argument,
which
is
central
to
the
court
of
appeals
decision,
is
highly
instructive.
the
determination
of
what
is
a
tax-exempt
organization
is
made
for
purposes
quite
different
from
those
that
underlie
the
determination
of
eligibility
criteria
for
the
cfc.
this
is
highlighted
by
the
fact
that
if
the
two
were
the
same,
there
could
be
over
300,000
participants
in
the
campaign,
a
circumstance
for
which
no
one
contends
and
everyone
agrees
would
be
undesirable
and
unworkable.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
mr.
chief
justice,
my
answer
to
that
is
yes.
now,
we
are
dealing
here
today
with
distinctions
that
affect
only
a
handful
of
groups,
30
or
40
maybe
at
the
outset,
but
i
don't
know
of
any
principal
basis
short
of
the
proposition
that
any
501(c)(3)
charity
that
has
qualified
for
501(c)(3)
status
is
eligible.
in
other
words,
if
the
distinction
between
the
legal
advocacy
groups
and
other
groups
is
not
within
the
president's
constitutional
power,
then
i
do
not
see
any
basis,
any
constitutional
basis
for
distinguishing
churches,
universities,
or
any
others.
we
submit
that
what
the
president
did
in
this
instance
clearly
is
reasonable.
of
course
the
lines
could
have
been
drawn
in
other
ways,
but
the
constitution
does
not
so
limit
the
president,
and
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
should
be
reversed.
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
just
two
matters,
mr.
chief
justice.
first,
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
mr.
ralston
had
addressed
only
one
of
the
three
reasonable
bases
for
what
the
president
did,
and
that
is
the
address
of
the
avoidance
of
controversy.
with
regard
to
the
lessening
of
the
federal
government's--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--the
only
one
he
thought
was
any
good.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
well,
whether
that
is
true
or
not,
certainly
the
president
is
entitled
to
make
some
reasonable
judgments.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
well,
the
reasons
are
really
set
forth--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--the
reasons
are
set
forth
in
the
content
of
the
executive
order
themselves.
they
are
spelled
out
with
at
least
the
amount
of
detail
that
were
spelled
out,
for
example,
in
the
perry
case
as
to
what
the
reason
was
for
avoiding
the
conflict
between
the
two
unions,
or
in
the
lehman
case
as
to
what
the
reason
was
for
the
city's
judgment
there
in
avoiding
disruptive
activity--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--well,
the
basis,
at
least,
for
those
judgments,
but
the
point
is
that
there
has
to
be
a
certain
amount
of
leeway
for...
there
is
no
way
that
anyone
can
determine
for
sure
whether
the
president
was
right
or
wrong
in
determining
that
the
contribution
to
the
government's
net
welfare
benefit
will
be
positive
or
negative.
that
is
a
factbound
issue
concerning
which
no
one
can
tell--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--yes,
it
is.
yes,
it
is.
and
with
regard
to
the
matter
of
keeping
down
the
costs
of
the
campaign
and
making
judgments
concerning
which
way
the
campaign
will
be
able
to
raise
more
money,
that
also
is
a
reasonable
basis.
now,
with
regard
to
the
one
of
the
three
bases
that
mr.
ralston
has
addressed,
namely,
the
avoiding
of
controversy,
with
regard
to
that
one,
he
necessarily
concedes
and
properly
concedes
that
it
matters
not
how
controversial,
how
extreme
the
controversy
may
be,
and
in
that
respect
he
has
necessarily
asked
the
court
to
overrule
its
holding
not
only
in
lehman
versus
shaker
heights
but
also
in
perry
versus
perry
local
educators'
association,
because
in
that
case
this
court
expressly
ruled
as
one
of
the
bases
for
its
decision
that
the
policy
of
excluding
communication
through
the
mailboxes
in
that
case
serves,
and
i
am
quoting
from
page
52
of
the
court's
opinion,
"serves
to
prevent
the
district
schools
from
becoming
a
battlefield
for
interunion
squabbles.
"
the
very
kind
of
thing,
the
very
kind
of
reasonable
basis
that
is
also
involved
in
this
particular
case.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
of
course,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
that
is
the
final
point
that
i
want
to
make.
all
that
mr.
ralston
has
succeeded
in
doing
is
making
a
case
that
it
would
be
reasonable,
it
would
not
have
been
unreasonable
to
have
included
the
legal
advocacy
groups
within
the
campaign.
what
he
has
shown
is
that
if
there
is
to
be
a
campaign,
the
reasonableness
test
that
has
to
govern
has
to
be
a
test
that
permits
a
fair
degree
of
operating
room
for
the
president's
decision,
because
i
submit
that
everyone,
churches,
certainly
universities,
every
501(c)(3)
charitable
organization
can
make
a
point
that
the
government
might
achieve
its
objectives
through
some
other
way,
or
might
make
a
point
that
they
are
very
similar
to
some
other
organization
that
has
been
included.
and
if
that
is
the
only
unprincipled,
unanchored
rule
of
law
that
governs
in
this
instance,
then
there
simply
is
no
stopping
it
short
of
everyone,
every
501(c)(3)
organization.
the
court
of
appeals
really
acknowledged
that
there
were
these
differences,
but
the
court
of
appeals
simply
held
that
the
differences
weren't
good
enough
and
that
maybe
there
was
some
other
way
to
achieve
it.
now,
if
that
is
the
test,
then
it
is
a
test
that
is
completely
open-ended.
we
submit
that
the
test
must
be,
is
the
president's
decision
reasonable,
and
is
it
free
of
arbitrariness
and
caprice?
i
fail
to
see,
for
example,
how
it
would
be
possible
if
mr.
ralston's
first
amendment
argument
is
correct,
how
it
would
be
possible
to
exclude
churches,
because
they
also
have
first
amendment
arguments
that
would
be
equally
applicable.
the
respondents,
in
short,
are
very
willing
to
suggest
deferential
lines
by
which
churches
could
be
expelled,
by
which
universities
could
be
expelled,
but
that
there
is
no
particular
need
to
draw
any
line
as
to
them.
any
principled
basis
on
which
the
federal
campaign
can
be
maintained
within
any
kind
of
manageable
bounds
has
to
be...
has
to
rest
upon
a
constitutional
rule
that
is
not
only
a
reasonableness
test,
but
a
reasonableness
test
that
permits
the
president
considerable
deference.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
yes.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
of
course
it
would
be
a
reasonable
ground.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
sure,
if
you
adopt
the
kind
of
standard
that
we
are
proposing,
that
is,
a
standard
that
is
truly
a
reasonableness
standard,
and
gives
a
certain
amount
of
deference
in
drawing
those
kinds
of
lines,
but
if
you
turn
it
around
the
other
way,
and
then
you
ask
yourself
the
question,
but
do
you
have
to
do
it
that
way--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--that
is
correct.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
that
is
correct,
but
it
is
not
just--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--that
is
correct,
but
we
still
have
the
other
two,
and
i
turn
back
to
perry
and
to
lehman,
and
the
reason
that
perry
and
lehman
are
good
law,
justice
stevens,
is
not
that
it
gives
a
hecklers
veto,
right
to
veto.
it
is
simply
that
it
is
looking
to
other
objectives,
other
than
just
the
fact
that
we
are
going
to
agree
with
the
disagreement
of
these
particular
individuals.
we
are
going
to
look
to
other
legitimate
governmental
concerns
that
arise
independently
of
the
disagreement,
such
as
the
disruption
in
the
work
place
that
would
have
occurred
in
perry,
and
that
i
have
simply
see
as
indistinguishable,
the
indistinguishable
kind
of
disruption
that--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--well,
it
might
chill
the
total
contributions,
and
it
might
increase,
or
a
person
could
certainly
conclude
that
it
might
increase
the
amount
of
time
and
effort
of
federal
employees
in
conducting
the
campaign,
and
as
i
say,
that
is
one
of
the
three
reasons.
unless
the
court
has
further
questions,
i
have
nothing
further.
