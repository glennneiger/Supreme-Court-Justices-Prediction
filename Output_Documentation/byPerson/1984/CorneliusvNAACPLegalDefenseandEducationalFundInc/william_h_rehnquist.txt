justice
rehnquist
was
that
decision
ever
appealed?
justice
rehnquist
is
there
any
indication
in
the
record
why
it
wasn't
appealed?
justice
rehnquist
well,
isn't
it
true
that
from
'61
until
the
first
court
action
in
this
case
that
traditional
charities
were
the
only
ones
in
the
federal
combined
campaign?
justice
rehnquist
do
you
think
the
government
allowing
churches
to
solicit
as
a
part
of
a
general
charitable
campaign
could
be
construed
as
the
government
supporting
religion?
