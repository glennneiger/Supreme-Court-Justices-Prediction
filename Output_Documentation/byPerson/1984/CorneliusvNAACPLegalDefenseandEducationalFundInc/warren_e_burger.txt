we
will
hear
arguments
next
in
devine
against
naacp
legal
defense
educational
fund.
mr.
solicitor
general,
i
think
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
burger
that
would
force
or
at
least
bring
some
pressure
to
include
churches
as
such,
would
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
mr.
ralston.
chief
justice
burger
how
about
the
district
of
columbia
bar
association,
for
example?
chief
justice
burger
how
about
the
aclu?
chief
justice
burger
when
the
designations
are
made,
is
that
controlling?
chief
justice
burger
what
about
the
undesignated
funds?
who
decides
how
they
are
divided?
chief
justice
burger
does
that
take
into
account
the
amount
that
was
received,
allocated
by
the
designation?
chief
justice
burger
may
i
ask
this?
chief
justice
burger
who
does
the
weighing,
and
on
what
standards
would
they
do
the
weighing
to
decide
whether
the
presence
of
certain
organizations
would
lead
some
employees
to
boycott
the
entire
enterprise?
chief
justice
burger
that
is
a
little
more
than...
it
is
broader
than
controversy,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
burger
i
was
thinking
of
planned
parenthood,
for
example.
you
would
automatically
have
a
certain
reflex
reaction
with
some
people,
would
you
not?
chief
justice
burger
how
about
the
socialist
party?
chief
justice
burger
how
about
the
socialist
party
of
america?
chief
justice
burger
it
certainly
would
involve
the
first
amendment
points
that
you
were
making.
chief
justice
burger
if
this
is
a
forum
and
the
first
amendment
applies,
i
have
difficulty
seeing
how
the
socialist
party
could
be
excluded.
chief
justice
burger
but
all
of
this
depends
upon
whether
this
is
or
is
not
a
public
forum,
does
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
have
anything
further,
mr.
solicitor
general?
chief
justice
burger
i
suppose
the
application
of
those
criteria
might
lead
to
striking
some
of
the
other
people
who
are
now
on
the
approved
list.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
