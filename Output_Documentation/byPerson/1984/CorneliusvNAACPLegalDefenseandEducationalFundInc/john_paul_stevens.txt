justice
stevens
mr.
solicitor
general,
may
i
ask
you
a
question
about
the
record?
i
notice
in
the
court
of
appeals
judge
star
made
quite
a
point
of
the
fact
that
this
was
a
summary
judgment
case,
and
that
inferences
could
be
drawn
that
were
different
from
those
drawn
by
the
majority.
and
in
your
brief
you
don't
seem
to
make
much
of
the
point
about
i
being
a
summary
judgment
case.
what
disposition
do
you
ask
for,
a
total
reversal
or
a
trial?
justice
stevens
you
think
the
record
is
adequate?
justice
stevens
mr.
ralston,
can
i
interrupt
you?
justice
stevens
you
referred
us
to
the
planned
parenthood
amicus
brief
which
i
looked
at
during
your
argument,
and
their
first
argument
is
that
the
executive
order
is
an
attempt
to
suppress
ideas
with
which
the
petitioner
disagrees.
you
don't
make
that
argument,
do
you?
justice
stevens
if
you
don't
make
that
argument,
and
i
understand
you
make
it
marginally,
i
guess,
what
is
the
standard?
there
is
a
line
drawing
problem.
your
opponent
argues
that,
well,
we
basically
have
got
to
draw
the
line
somewhere.
maybe
you
say
no,
anybody
who
applies
ought
to...
for
example,
what
about
churches?
would
they
exclude
all
churches?
justice
stevens
mr.
lee?
justice
stevens
what
about
his
suggestion
that
you
could
limit
it
to
organizations
that
solicit
funds,
their
principal
source
of
funds
are
derived
from
general
public
solicitations,
which
i
suppose
would
take
churches
out
of
it?
wouldn't
that
be
a
reasonable--
justice
stevens
--so
you
could
draw
a
line
that
would
exclude
churches,
i
take
it.
justice
stevens
well,
i
guess
you
would
agree
you
at
least
have
to
say
that
your
reason
has
to
be
a
constitutionally
permissible
reason.
justice
stevens
and
neutral,
so
that
if,
for
example,
controversy
is
not
a
constitutionally
permissible
reason,
then
you'd
be
in
some
trouble.
justice
stevens
as
suggested
by
perry.
justice
stevens
well,
you
don't
claim
that
controversy
causes
that
sort
of
harm.
you
just
say
it
might
chill
the
total
contributions.
that
is
the
only
significance
of
controversy.
