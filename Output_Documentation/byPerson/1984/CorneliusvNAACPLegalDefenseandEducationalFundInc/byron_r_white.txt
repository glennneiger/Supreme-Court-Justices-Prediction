why
not?
justice
white
the
cases
were
judged
that
you
may
constitutionally
be
kept
from
sharing
the
undesignated
funds?
justice
white
i
am
curious
why
you
didn't.
justice
white
maybe
you
thought
you
would
lose.

justice
white
well,
i
suppose
the
exclusion
was
for
some
reason.
in
the
litigation
was
there
some
reason
given
for
excluding
it?
justice
white
well,
do
you
accept
that
as
the
reason,
that
that
was
really
the
active
reason?
justice
white
and
you
say
that...
and
your
position
is,
that
is
just
inadequate?
justice
white
well,
you
would...
i
take
it
if
your
argument
is
sound
it
wouldn't
make
any
difference
how
much
controversy
had
been...
would
be
engendered,
and
even
if
half
or
three-quarters
of
the
people
who
had
been
participating
would
no
longer
participate,
you
would
still
be
entitled
to
be
in.
justice
white
for
your
argument
it
is
just
irrelevant
how
much
controversy
there
is.
justice
white
your
position
you
don't
think
is
inconsistent
with
shaker
heights?
justice
white
you
said
that
was
the
only--
justice
white
--testimony
before
the
district
court.
is
that
true
or
not?
justice
white
how
do
we
know
what
the
reasons
were
for
his
actions,
excluding?
how
do
we
know
that?
you
may--
justice
white
--it
may
be
that
there
are
a
lot
of
reasons
he
might
have
had,
but
what
were
they?
justice
white
so
we
are
to
find
the
reasons
in
the
executive
order?
is
that
where
we
look
for
them?
justice
white
now,
is
that
the
reason
stated
in
the
executive
order?
