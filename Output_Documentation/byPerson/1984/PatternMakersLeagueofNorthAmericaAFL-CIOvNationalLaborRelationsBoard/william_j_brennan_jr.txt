mr.
gold,
may
i
ask,
is
there
anything
in
the
record...
how
much
knowledge,
if
any,
of
this
league
law
13
any
of
the
eleven
employees
involved
had
at
the
time
they
joined?
justice
jr.
but
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
that
they
were
affirmatively
informed
of
this
provision
when
they
joined?
justice
jr.
were
these
eleven
members
of
the
union
at
the
time
of
the
adoption
of
this
provision?
justice
jr.

board's
holding
as
an
employee
union
member
is
simply
not
at
liberty
to
waive
the
right
under
8(b)(1)(a)?
justice
jr.
under
no
circumstances
may
an
employee
waive
it?
justice
jr.
no,
that
wasn't
my
question.
a
holding
that
the
union
member,
if
presented
with
this
clause
before
he
joins,

look
what
happens
to
you
if
you
were
to
strike,
and
he
says
that's
perfectly
all
right
with
me,
that's
all
right,
i
will
go
along
with
that
and
i
join.
if
that
were
a
waiver,
the
board
says
it's
not
to
be--
