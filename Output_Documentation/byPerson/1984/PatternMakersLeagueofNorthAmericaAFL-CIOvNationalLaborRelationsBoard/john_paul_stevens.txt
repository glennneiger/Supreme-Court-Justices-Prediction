justice
stevens
mr.
fried,
may
i
inquire
at
this
point,
because
it
seems
to
me
their
stronger
argument
does
not
necessarily
rely
on
the
proviso,
but
rather
relies
on
the
fact
that
the
house
originated
both
the
words
the
"right
to
refrain"
and
the
provision
that
was
deleted
that
said
that
this
doesn't
affect
the
right
to
resign.
and
if
you
have
those
in
the
same
bill
that
originated
in
the
house,
does
not
that
imply
that
the
right
to
refrain
without
the
other
would
not
encompass
the
right
to
resign?
justice
stevens
well,
let's
take
it
one
step
at
a
time.
would
it
not
be
true
that
within
the
house
original
submission,
that
at
least
your
first
reading
of
it
should
be
that
the
right
to
refrain
was
not
enough
to
accomplish
what
8(c)(4),
i
guess
it
was,
was
intended
to
accomplish?
why
would
they
have
had
both
provisions
if
the
right
to
refrain
did
the
whole
job?
just
looking
at
the
house
itself
for
the
moment.
justice
stevens
i
understand
the
force
of
your
argument
on
the
compromise
on
the
conference...
i'm
still
trying
to
think
through
the
initial
drafting
of
the
language,
at
least
creates
an
inference
that
at
that
point
they
thought
something
more
than
the
right
to
refrain
was
probably
needed.
that's
the
first...
it
seems
to
me
the
first
question
we
ought
to
ask
ourselves.
but
i
see
what
you
say;
well,
maybe
they
later
on
decided
it
might
have
been
redundant.
it
hardly
would
seem
redundant
in
the
very
first
bill.
that's
the
thing
that--
justice
stevens
--it
apparently
worked,
too.
[laughter]
justice
stevens
let
me
ask
you
one
question
on
deference,
if
i
may,
mr.
fried.
do
you
think
the
issue
is
one
on
which,
if
the
board
had
gone
the
other
way,
it
would
have
been
clearly
wrong?
or
could
it
have
gone
either
way
on
this
issue?
