justice
rehnquist
what
panel
did
the
union
impose?
justice
rehnquist
well,
could
the
union
expel
these
members
for
failure
to
pay
the
fines
so
that
they
wouldn't
have
to
resort
to
state
court
collection
proceedings
under
state
law?
justice
rehnquist
now,
has
the
union
permanently
given
up
the
opportunity
to
expel
here
by
imposing
a
fine,
or
could
it,
if
the
fine
proved
uncollectible
under
its
own
constitution,
say
well,
you
failed
to
pay;
we're
going
to
expel
you
for
that.
justice
rehnquist
if
you're
right
about
that,
mr.
gold,
doesn't
that
cast
some
doubt
on
the
correctness
of
the
court's
decision
in
the
textile
workers
case?
justice
rehnquist
you
mean
prevail
with
the
board
later?
with
the
board
at
least.
justice
rehnquist
well,
you're
a
little
cynical.
8(c)
simply...
that
proposed
8(c)
that
was
eliminated
was
simply
made
a...
just
added
a
specific
unfair
labor
practice
with
respect
to...
or
did
it?
