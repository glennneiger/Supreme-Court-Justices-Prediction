justice
white
--of
course,
your
position
is
that
he
had
no
right
to
waive.
justice
white
that's
your
primary--
justice
white
--limited
these
rights
to
the
extent
necessary
to
let
the
union
run
its
own
affairs.
justice
white
and
i
take
it
that
you
rest
on
the
legislative
history.
justice
white
if
there
was
nothing
but
the
language,
you
probably
would
be
in
more
trouble.
justice
white
well,
unless
you
are
inclined
to
say
that
if
the
board
gave
it
a
permissible
reading,
you'd
think
it.
justice
white
that
the
language
wins
your
case.
justice
white
you're
very
close
to
a
waiver
argument
there.
justice
white
mr.
gold,
was
there
any
discussion
before
or
after
or
during
the
conference
report
with
respect
to
this
specific
problem?
justice
white
whether
a
union
could
fine
a
member
for
strike-breaking?
justice
white
which
is
the
language
of
their
statements
do
you
most
strongly
relate?
justice
white
but
that's
an
argument
that
the
failure
to
include
the
unfair
labor
practice,
which
was
what...
8(c)?
justice
white
failure
to
include
that,
that
supposedly
limits
the
meaning
of
7(a)
is
your
argument?
justice
white
and
i
suppose
if
you
were
a
member
of
the
house
or
the
senate
voting
on
this
conference
report
on
the
final...
and
you
just
sat
and
read
it...
you
may
not
know,
wouldn't
have
had
the
faintest
notion
of
all
this
background
that
you
have
just
recounted.
you
may
have
had
some
feeling
about
it,
but
you
voted
on
the
language
of
the
bill.
justice
white
said
we
lost
a
lot
of
stuff.
justice
white
i
know
that's
what
you
say,
but
nobody
mentioned
it.
they
lost
that
unfair
labor
practice.
justice
white
well,
mr.
fried,
i
take
it
that
your
colleague
on
the
other
side
seems
to
agree
that
if
we
were
just
looking
at
the
words
of
the
act
and
structure,
that
maybe
the
board
has
got
a
pretty
good
case.
but
he
rests
on
the
legislative
history
which
he
claims
requires
that
these
words
be
given
a
different
meaning
than
you
are
urging.
justice
white
i
wouldn't
think
you
would
have
to
find
anything
in
the
legislative
history
that
would
support
your
view.
all
you
have
to
do
is
negative...
the
suggestion
that
the
legislative
history
requires
an
interpretation
contrary
to
yours.
it
would
be
helpful,
i
suppose,
if
you
had
some
support.
[laughter]
justice
white
to
protect
the
rights
under
section
7?
justice
white
might
you
have
a
little
difficulty
here?
this
local
operates
in
both
illinois
and
wisconsin,
does
it
not?
justice
white
well,
you
could
as
well
argue
that
you
are
relying
on
a
technicality
to
distinguish
the
case
from
allis-chalmers.
justice
white
resignation.
justice
white
i
was
just
repeating
that
it
was...
if
you
call
it
a
technicality,
it's
a
technicality...
resignation.
justice
white
i
didn't
say
it
was
unimportant.
[laughter]
