mr.
charles
fried
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
having
decided
that
a
union
commits
an
unfair
labor
practice
by
seeking
court-enforceable
fines
against
members
who
have
resigned
to
go
back
to
work
during
a
strike,
the
court
considers
today
the
board
ruling
that
a
union
may
not
accomplish
precisely
the
same
result
by
recasting
its
rule
so
as
to
forbid
strike
resignations
by
those
who
would
go
back
to
work.
now,
in
considering
that
board
ruling,
i
respectfully
remind
the
court
that
the
court
has
frequently
said
that
the
interpretation
of
the
act
is
in
the
first
instance
for
the
board,
and
that
that
interpretation
by
the
board
of
its
act
is
due
great
deference,
so
long
as
its
interpretation
is...
and
i
quote
mr.
justice
stewart
in
the
american
shipbuilding
case...
"not
inconsistent
with
the
fundamental
structure
of
the
act.
"
therefore,
i
think
it
is
helpful
to
consider
at
the
outset
what
the
fundamental
structure
of
the
act
is.
and
surely
there
is
nothing
more
fundamental
to
the
structure
of
the
act
than
section
7.
section
7
of
the
wagner
act,
an
act
of
1935,
was
the
centerpiece
of
that
piece
of
legislation.
it
was
the
great
charter
of
liberties
of
the
union
movement.
employees
shall
have
the
right
to
self-organization
and
to
engage
in
considered
activities.
in
1947,
the
congress
sought
to
enlarge
that
charter
of
liberties
and
to
add...
and
i
quote
here
from
the
preamble
of
the
taft-hartley
act...
"further
rights"...
and
i
quote
here...
"to
protect
the
rights
of
individual
employees
in
their
relations
with
labor
organizations.
"
so
that
when
the
first
part
of
section
7
was
enacted,
it
protected
the
rights
of
employees,
vis
a
vis
employers;
the
second
part,
which
added
the
words
"and
shall
also
have
the
right
to
refrain
from
any
and
all
such
activities.
"
created
an
enlargement
and
a
symmetry
in
speaking
of
the
individual's
rights
vis
a
vis
labor
organizations.
now,
in
the
early
days
of
section
7
of
the
wagner
act,
employers
regularly
came
to
the
board
and
came
to
the
court
to
argue
that
they
had
made
bargains
with
employees
in
which
employees
had
bargained
away
those
great
rights,
and
they
had
made
fair
bargains,
reasonable
bargains,
bargains
for
a
limited
time
only,
and
that
the
employees
had
struck
those
bargains
with
their
eyes
open.
and
the
board
and
the
court
regularly
turned
those
arguments
down,
saying
that
section
7
rights
cannot
be
bargained
away.
the
great
case
in
this
court
is
national
licorice.
what
the
board
does
here
in
its
understanding
of
the
fundamental
structure
of
the
act
is
that
the
right
in
the
second
part
of
section
7
also
cannot
be
bargained
away,
no
matter
how
fair
the
union
provision
is,
no
matter
how
limited
in
scope,
and
no
matter
that
the
member
entered
into
this
bargain,
bargaining
away
his
rights
with
his
eyes
open.
so
there
is
a
symmetry
here
and
the
structure
which
the
board
discerns
seems
to
us
to
be
a
structure
which
makes
sense,
which
is
a
coherent
structure.
indeed,
the
only
exception
which
section
7
admits
this
right
to
refrain
relates
to
union
security
clauses,
and
this
court
was
most
emphatic
over
a
generation
ago
in
the
general
motors
case,
that
union
may
not,
by
union
security
clauses,
demand
any
more
than
financial
core
membership.
that
is
to
say,
such
an
allegiance
which
does
not
submit
an
individual
worker
to
union
discipline.
mr.
charles
fried
over
the
last
dozen
years,
justice
o'connor,
the
board
in
every
major
case
has
held
that
a
union
attempt
to
impose
court-enforceable
fines
on
workers
who
would
go
back
to
work
during
a
strike,
when
those
workers
have
indicated
their
desire
no
longer
to
be
affiliated
with
the
union,
constitutes
an
unfair
labor
practice.
so
we
don't
have
here
some
dramatic
u-turn
in
the
position
of
the
board,
but
a
consistent
picture
which
the
board
has
been
elaborating
since
this
issue
first
surfaced,
and
a
picture
which
this
court
has
twice
added
its
hand
to
the
elaboration
of.
now,
the
petitioners
rely
very
heavily
on
the
provision
of
section
8(b)(a).
they
rely
on
the
proviso
which
reserves
to
the
union
the
right
to
make
rules
regarding
the
acquisition
and
retention
of
membership.
the
board's
reading
of
that
proviso,
we
submit,
is
a
perfectly
natural
reading,
but
also
a
reading
which
carries
forward
a
consistent,
a
coherent
picture
of
the
structure
of
the
act.
for
what
it
says
on
one
hand
under
section
7,
is
the
employee's
relation
to
the
union
is
wholly
voluntary.
he
may
join
if
he
wishes
and
he
may
leave
when
he
wishes.
and
under
the
proviso
as
the
board
reads
it,
what
congress
is
saying,
it
is
voluntary
on
the
other
side
of
the
relationship
also.
the
union
may
accept
a
member
if
it
wishes
and
may
terminate,
that
is
to
say,
expel
the
member
when
it
wishes.
thus,
the
board's
reading
is
a
reasonable
one
and
makes
sense
out
of
the
structure
of
the
act.
the
petitioners'
reading
of
the
proviso
would
have
the
word
"retention"
take
on
the
meaning
that
the
union
has
some
kind
of
a
power
to
hold
onto
a
member
who
no
longer
wishes
to
maintain
his
membership.
now,
had
the
same
really
rather
powerful
argument
which
petitioners
and
unions
urge
and
have
urged
consistently
before
this
court,
arguments
in
terms
of
free
riding,
arguments
in
terms
of
solidarity,
had
those
arguments
been
deployed
to
require
an
interpretation
of
the
parallel
word
"acquisition"
of
membership,
such
that
the
union
may
reach
out
and
impose
membership
on
an
unwilling
worker,
this
court
would
reject
that
reading
out
of
hand.
what
the
board
does
here
is
to
read
the
word
7.
mr.
charles
fried
justice
white,
if
the
legislative
history
plainly
indicated
an
intention
of
the
congress
to
allow
this
kind
of
strike
resignation
fining,
we
would
not
be
here,
we
would
not
have
this
case
for
the
third
time
before
the
court.
of
course,
the
legislative
history
in
our
view
is
really
quite
indeterminate
on
this
point,
which
is
what
presents
the
problem.
the
closest,
i
think,
in
the
legislative
history
that
we
can
come
to
an
elucidation
of
the
meaning
of
the
proviso
are
the
words
of
senator
holland
himself
who
was
the
proponent
of
the
proviso
in
its
present
terms
to
the
senate.
mr.
charles
fried
the
greatest
help,
your
honor,
which
i
find
in
the
legislative
history
is
senator
holland's
own
explanation
of
the
function
of
the
proviso,
for
he
says...
and
i
quote
from
a
passage
on
page
20
of
the
petitioners'
brief...
that
"the
function
of
the
proviso
has
to
do
with
admission
and
expulsion
of
members.
"
and
that,
of
course,
is
precisely
how
the
board
reads
it;
is
that
the
proviso
deals
with
the
admission
and
expulsion
of
members.
that
makes
quite
plain
that
what
senator
holland
was
seeking
to
accomplish
was
to
reserve
to
the
union
that
same
freedom
of
action
which
section
7
reserved
to
the
individual
worker.
the
relationship
is
voluntary
symmetrically
on
both
sides.
mr.
charles
fried
justice
stevens,
i
think
that
the
implication
is
wholly
indeterminate
in
that
respect.
the
sponsor
of
the
house
provisions,
congressman
hartley,
described
the
senate...
the
final
senate
version
as
being
broader
in
scope
in
general.
that
was
his
general
word.
now,
whether
that
is
intended
to
indicate--
mr.
charles
fried
--legislation
is
frequently
full
of
redundant
terms,
of
terms
that
go
over
the
same
grounds
in
specific
ways
as
well
as
in
general
ways.
and,
therefore,
i
think
what
one
must
ask
is
whether
there
is
anything
in
the
legislative
history
which,
with
sufficient
specificity,
indicates
that
by
dropping
that
language
the
house
members
were
attending
to
the
point
which
my
brother
gold
insists
they
were
attending
to,
or
whether
they
viewed
themselves
really
as
acceding
to
more
general
and
admittedly
more
debatable
language.
mr.
charles
fried
of
course,
it's
a
fact
that
is
well
known,
that
when
there's
a
fight...
and
my
brother
gold
is
quite
right...
there
were
a
lot
of
fights
concerned
with
this
legislation...
it
is
often
the
part
of
prudence
to
recede
in
favor
of
vaguer,
more
general
language,
and
hope
that
you
will
prevail
later.
that
is
a
very
understandable
tactic
of
compromise.
mr.
charles
fried
we
shall
see,
sir.
mr.
charles
fried
prevail
with
the
board,
prevail
in
the
courts,
prevail
with
those
who
are
considering
the
structure
of
the
act
as
a
whole.
having
created
perhaps
some
kind
of
an
ambiguity,
having
created
a
question,
the
question
then
becomes,
given
the
whole
texture,
given
what
justice
white
referred
to
as
the
web
and
structure
of
the
act,
did
not
the
proponents
of
the
house
language
in
fact
have
their
way,
though
they
lost
the
specific
wording?
that
is
the
question
which
we
put
before
you.
mr.
charles
fried
it
added
a
specific
unfair
labor
practice
and--
mr.
charles
fried
--whether
that
was
how
the
congress
was
thinking,
and
whether
the
house
had
the
matter
that
firmly
in
mind
is
something
that
i
cannot
give
you
assurance
of.
it
is
a
striking
fact
that
what
the
house
was
concerned
about
in
that
right
to
resign
provision
was
specifically
to
protect
the
rights
of
workers.
and
this,
i
think,
might
help
in
answering
justice
stevens'
question.
what
the
house
was
concerned
with
was,
as
they
were
throughout,
in
protecting
the
rights
of
workers
who
resigned
and
whom
the
union
then
seeks
to
terminate
as
employees
under
a
union
security
clause.
and
that
matter
surely
was
covered,
and
adequately
covered
by
the
more
general
language
and
by
this
court's
decision
in
the
general
motors
case.
mr.
charles
fried
it
does
help,
mr.
chief
justice,
but
the
court
limits
the
board
to
asking
whether
its
reading
is
not
inconsistent
with
the
fundamental
structure
of
the
act,
and
that
is
why
we
come
back
again
and
again
to
that
fundamental
structure.
it
is
our
contention
that
the
structure
which
the
petitioners
urge
is
not
a
coherent
structure,
whereas
the
structure
which
the
board's
decisions
consistently,
over
a
period
of
a
dozen
years
has
been
moving
towards,
is
one
which
is
balanced
and
fair
on
both
sides.
mr.
charles
fried
it
is
evidently
some
support.
i
believe
it
is
not
sufficient
support
in
the
overall
context
of
what
is
being
done.
i
recall
senator
taft's
words
as
he
accepted
senator
holland's
proviso.
he
accepted
the
proviso
without
objection.
he
found
it
perfectly
understandable
for,
as
he
said...
and
i
quote...
his
only
purpose
was,
to
quote,
"outlaw
restraint
and
coercion
as
would
prevent
people
from
going
to
work
if
they
wanted
to
go
to
work.
"
that
is
how
senator
taft
understood
the
general
structure
of
what
he
was
doing,
and
he
thought
that
senator
holland's
proviso
fit
into
that
structure
perfectly
comfortably.
now,
therefore,
i
don't
think
we
need
to
work
the
elaborate
inferences
from
enactment
and
failure
to
enact
which
this
court
was
forced
to
resort
to
in
the
curtis
brothers
case,
which
i
think
are
not
necessary
to
a
decision
in
favor
of
the
board's
ruling
in
this
case.
i
would
suggest
that
the
picture
which
the
petitioners
give
of
the
word
"retention"
in
that
proviso
is
a
picture
which
is
similar
to
the
word
"detention",
that
it
means
that
a
union
is
empowered
to
hold
on
to
a
member
who
no
longer
wishes
to
be
a
member.
and
the
petitioners
understandably
insist
upon
the
fact
that
after
all
here,
so
far
as
we
know,
the
union
member
was
well
aware
of
this
provision
either
at
the
time
he
joined
the
union
or
after
the
league
law
13
was
passed
and
when
he
had
a
chance
to
get
out.
but
these
section
7
rights,
the
court
has
said
again
and
again,
cannot
be
bargained
away.
so
the
picture
that
is
being
offered
by
the
petitioners
is
a
picture
which
the
petitioners,
the
union
in
the
granite
state
case
also
offered
to
this
court,
and
in
their
brief
they
offered
a
picture
of
the
worker
as...
and
i
quote
here
from
their
brief...
"a
volunteer
for
military
service,
under
strict
discipline
for
the
duration.
"
now,
the
picture
which
the
board
offers
of
the
union/member
relationship
was
well
stated
by
mr.
justice
douglas
in
that
same
granite
state
case,
where
he
said
it
was
a
picture
"normally
reflected
in
our
free
institutions,
the
right
of
the
individual
to
join
or
to
resign
from
associations
as
he
sees
fit.
"
the
question
for
the
court
is
whether
the
board
correctly
understood
the
fundamental
structure
of
the
act
as
enacting
the
military
picture
of
the
member
as
a
volunteer
for
military
service
or
mr.
justice
douglas's
picture.
now,
the
petitioners
go
back
to
the
law
of
voluntary
associations,
and
properly
so,
because
the
great
case
in
this
court
on
the
whole
issue
of
fining
union
members
is
the
allis-chalmers
case.
since
the
statute
says
not
a
word
about
fining
union
members,
it's
in
that
case
that
that
right
was
established.
but
the
allis-chalmers
case
emphasized
that
the
power
to
impose
court-enforceable
fines
was
predicated
on
the
fact
that
the
fined
person
"enjoyed
full
union
membership",
and
that
what
was
at
stake
was
purely
internal...
internal
regulation.
now,
the
state
law
on
voluntary
associations
is
said
to
clearly
require,
to
clearly
recognize
the
right
of
a
voluntary
association
to
restrict
the
right
of
members
to
resign.
and
in
this
regard,
the
petitioners
rely
on
the
weighty
authority
of
corpus
juris
secundum.
i
would
engage
in
a
battle
of
the
giants
here
and
bring
in
the
weighty
authority
of
am.
jur.
second,
which
says
that
a
member
may
lawfully
resign
at
any
time
from
an
association
or
club,
and
a
bylaw
which
restricts
this
right
or
makes
the
withdrawal
subject
to
the
organization's
approval
is
invalid.
well,
the
fact
of
the
matter
is,
i
would
give
no
great
weight
to
either
of
these
weighty
authorities
because
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
the
common
law
of
voluntary
associations
is
underdeveloped
and
in
conflict
on
the
subject
of
whether
an
association
may
or
may
not
restrict
an
individual
in
his
attempt
to
resign.
one
thing,
however,
is
quite
clear;
that
those
cases...
and
there
are
cases,
common
law
cases,
which
recognize
an
association's
right
to
restrict
a
member's
resignation...
all
make
it
quite
clear
that
those
restrictions
will
be
placed
under
the
strictest
court
scrutiny
to
see
whether
they
comport
with
state
public
policy
of
fairness.
the
question
which
this
court
must
consider
is
whether
the
issue,
not
of
the
reasonableness
of
a
union
fine,
which
this
court
clearly
remits
to
state
law,
but
the
question
of
the
outer
perimeters
of
the
union/member
relationship
should
also
be
remitted
to
50
varying
state
court
policies,
so
that
in
one
state
such
a
restriction
is
unreasonable;
in
another
state
such
a
restriction
does
comport
with
public
policy.
mr.
charles
fried
yes,
that
would
be
a
very
great
difficulty,
mr.
justice
blackmun.
it
would
seem
that
this
matter...
and
here
is
a
fundamental
difference
which
the
board
has
with
the
petitioners...
this
matter
of
the
outer
limits
of
a
union's
reach
over
those
who
would
not
be
members
is
no
longer
merely
an
internal
matter,
but
becomes
a
matter
for
federal
labor
policy,
a
matter
indeed
entrusted
in
the
first
instance
to
the
board
as
it
interprets...
as
it
interprets
the
fundamental
structure
of
the
act.
now,
i
would
like,
if
i
may,
to
speculate
for
a
moment
with
the
court
about
the
effects
of
this
board's
ruling,
the
board's
ruling
on
the
situation
of
unions,
because
the
suggestion
is
that
this
ruling
is
a
disaster.
it
would
seem,
first
of
all,
that
we
must
recall
that
this
ruling
is
no
great
innovation.
after
all,
this
court
has
said
in
granite
state
and
in
booster
lodge
that
a
union
may
not
offer
the
following
bargain
to
a
potential
member:
you
may
join
with
us,
but
only
on
condition
that
you
agree,
having
resigned,
not
to
go
back
to
work
during
a
strike.
what
has
the
union
done
here?
through
a
merely
technical
reformulation,
they
offer
a
member
the
following
bargain:
you
may
join
with
us,
but
only
on
condition
that
you
agree
not
to
resign
in
order
to
go
back
to
work
during
the
strike.
mr.
charles
fried
it
is
a
technicality,
justice--
mr.
charles
fried
--it
is
a
technicality,
justice
white,
on
which
this
court
has
laid
great
emphasis,
particularly
in
the
words
which
said
that
a
union
member
is,
in
general,
free
to
leave
the
union
and
escape
the
rule.
i
think
this
court
has
viewed
resignation--
mr.
charles
fried
--but
it's
a
technicality
which--
mr.
charles
fried
--the
other
matter
which--
mr.
charles
fried
--had
the
board...
had
the
board
said
that
a
union
may
restrict
in
this
unlimited
way
the
right
of
strike
resignation,
it
is
our
contention
that
this
would
be
at
war
with
the
fundamental
structure
of
the
act.
yes,
sir.
mr.
charles
fried
had
the
board
decided
that
a
union
is
entitled
to
insist
on
certain
formalities
in
processing
strike
resignations,
and
maybe
even
including
a
brief
delay
during
which
the
union
absorbs
the
fact
that
these
men
are,
in
fact,
resigning,
that
might
well
be
within
the
discretion
of
the
board.
but
a
restriction
as
extensive
as
30
days
raises
the
very
gravest
doubts
in
our
mind
about
it's
consistent
with
those
section
7
rights
and
the
notion
that
those
rights
may
not
be
bargained
away.
mr.
charles
fried
it
would
be
a
harder
case
for
our
opposition,
but
i
don't
believe,
mr.
justice
blackmun,
that
it
would
be
a
decision
which
we
would
care
to
defend.
i
would
like
to
simply
underline
one
matter
in
terms
of
the
effect
of
this
decision.
for,
though
the
board
adheres
fast
to
the
right
of
a
member
to
leave
the
union
and
escape
the
rule,
the
court
must
remember
that
this
is
not
a
costless
option.
the
union
continues
to
be
the
mandatory
bargaining
representative
of
that
worker,
and
in
choosing
to
resign,
he
loses
his
voice
and
he
loses
his
voice
most
particularly
in
regard
to
the
question
of
whether
he
may
participate
in
a
vote
to
take
that
unit
out
on
strike,
and
he
loses
his
voice
in
deciding
whether
to
accept
a
new
contract...
a
new
contract
to
end
the
strike.
so
there
is
a
penalty,
there
is
a
price
that
the
man
pays
when
he
exists,
when
he
exercises
his
right
under
free
institutions
to
exit.
finally,
i
might
say
that
over
the
years,
employers
have
found
no
more
effective
tactic
in
arguing
against
union
representation
than
to
urge
that
union
membership
is
like
joining
the
army.
now,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
board's
ruling
here
would
establish
once
and
for
all
the
notion
that
union
membership
is
a
free
relationship,
voluntary
on
both
sides,
and
this
may
very
well
open
the
way
to
a
more
solid
form
of
solidarity,
based
indeed
on
the
fact
of
an
intrinsic
loyalty.
i
thank
the
court
for
it
attention.
