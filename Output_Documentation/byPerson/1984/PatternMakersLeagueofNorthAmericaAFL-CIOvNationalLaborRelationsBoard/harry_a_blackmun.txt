justice
blackmun
--do
you
know
whether
the
fines,
in
fact,
have
been
paid?
justice
blackmun
would
you
say
the
same
thing
about
the
30-day
provision
that
two
members
speculated
on?
justice
blackmun
i
suppose
one
could
say
that
that
kind
of
30-day
provision
makes
it
a
harder
case
for
your
opposition.
