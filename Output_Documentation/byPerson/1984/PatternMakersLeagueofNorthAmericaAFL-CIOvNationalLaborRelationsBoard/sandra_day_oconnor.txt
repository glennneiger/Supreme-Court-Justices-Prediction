justice
o'connor
the
fines
amounted
to
all
of
their
salaries
earned
when
they
went
back
to--
justice
o'connor
mr.
fried,
has
the
board's
interpretation,
present
interpretation
of
these
provisions
been
a
consistent
one
throughout
the
years?
justice
o'connor
mr.
fried,
in
the
curtis
brothers
case,
this
court
did
something
along
the
lines
that
mr.
gold
has
urged
today;
to
wit,
infer
from
congress's
failure
to
enact
more
specific
provisions,
that
we
should
look
to
that
failure
to
enact
specific
in
interpreting
the
end
result.
do
you
think
that
that
case
poses
some
support
for
your
opponent?
