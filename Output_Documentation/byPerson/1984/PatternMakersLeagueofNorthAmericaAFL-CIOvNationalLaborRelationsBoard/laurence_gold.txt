mr.
laurence
stephen
gold
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
the
question
in
this
case
is
whether
the
national
labor
relations
board
is
correct
in
its
ruling
that
all
union
rules
placing
restrictions
on
the
time
and
circumstances
under
which
a
member
may
resign
from
the
union
are
invalidated
by
section
8(b)(1)(a)
of
the
national
labor
relations
act,
as
amended,
is
correct.
the
facts
which
raise
that
question
are
these:
the
pattern
makers'
union
adopted
a
provision
in
its
constitution
and
bylaws
which
we
set
out
at
page
3
of
our
brief,
the
blue
brief,
which
states:
"no
resignation
or
withdrawal
from
an
assocication
or
from
the
league
shall
be
accepted
during
a
strike
or
lockout
or
at
a
time
when
a
strike
or
lockout
appears
imminent.
"
that
provision
was
considered
at
the
union's
convention
in
1976
and
then
was
sent
to
a
referendum
of
the
union's
members,
and
finally
approved
and
became
effective
in
1976.
thereafter,
a
strike
did
ensue,
involving
the
rockford
and
beloit
local
unions
of
the
pattern
makers'
union.
some
eleven
members
of
those
local
unions
put
in
resignations
during
the
strike
and
went
back
to
work
thereafter.
the
union,
when
the
strike
was
finally
settled,
sought
to
impose
union
discipline
on
these
individuals.
charges
were
served,
a
trial
was
held,
and
the
result
was
that
the
case
went
to
the
national
labor
relations
board
on
the
allegation
that
the
union's
action
in
seeking
to
discipline
these
individuals
for
violating
the
union's
underlying
rule
that
engaging
in
strike-breaking
activity
is
unlawful
as
a
matter
of
union
law,
violated
section
8(b)(1)(a).
mr.
laurence
stephen
gold
the
union
imposed
on
the
individuals
for
engaging
in
the
strike-breaking
activity.
mr.
laurence
stephen
gold
my
memory,
justice
o'connor,
is
that
the
fines
were
in
the
amount
earned
while
engaging
in
strike-breaking
activity.
and,
of
course,
the
question
of
the
state
of
those
fines
is
a
matter
for
state
law
to
determine
under
this
court's
decisions
in
the
boeing
&
machinist
case.
the
validity
of
the
fines,
whether
the
fine's
reasonable
in
amount,
and
so
on
are
a
matter
of
the
state
law
of
membership
associations
and
the
state
law
of
contracts;
and
the
extent
to
which
the
fines
are
enforceable,
this
court
has
held,
is
to
be
determined
in
that
forum.
so
all
we
have
is
in
inchoate
action
by
the
union,
subject
to
only
one
means
of
enforcement;
namely,
a
state
court
lawsuit
to
collect
the
amounts
in
question
with
the
law
on
what
is
collectible,
a
matter
of
state
law.
mr.
laurence
stephen
gold
my
understanding
is
they
have
not.
mr.
laurence
stephen
gold
yes.
there
are,
as
we
understand
the
law
developed
by
this
court
from
allis
chalmers
through
machininsts
&
boeing,
two
lawful
methods
for
enforcing
a
rule
against
strike-breaking
against
full
union
members.
obviously,
unless
the
person
chooses
to
join
the
union,
to
become
a
full
union
member
and
be
bound
by
the
constitution,
the
union
can't
take
any
disciplinary
action.
but
if
somebody,
as
in
this
case,
and
it's
conceded,
if
someone
joins
a
union,
becomes
a
full
member,
agrees
to
abide
by
the
constitution
and
bylaws,
then
the
union
has
two
choices:
one,
to
take
action
which
leads
to
expulsion;
two,
to
take
action
which
leads
to
a
fine
which
can
be
attempted
to
be
enforced
through
court
action.
those
are
the
only
two
options
open
to
the
union.
mr.
laurence
stephen
gold
i
presume...
i've
never
seen
a
case
of
that
kind.
i
presume
that
a
union
which
first
seeks
a
fine,
to
collect
a
fine,
and
is
told
by
the
courts
that
the
fine
is
too
high
an
amount
or
procedurally
imposed
in
an
imperfect
way,
would
still
have
the
option
of
expulsion.
the
only
argument
i
can
see
the
other
way
is
that
there
is
some
choice
of
remedies
or
waiver
by
the
union.
i
don't
think
that
would
be
the
rule.
usually,
unions
seek
to
go
one
way
or
the
other
initially.
in
many
unions,
the
complaint,
internal
complaint
filed
against
the
members,
says
what
the
penalty
being
sought
will
be.
and
some
union
constitutions
provide
that
if
the
only
penalty
that
can
be
imposed
is
that
which
the
member
has
been
given
fair
notice
of,
so
that
he
can
make
his
determination
whether
to
defend
or
not.
some
people
faced
with
expulsion
wouldn't
choose
to
defend,
and
it
would
be
unfair
to
come
around
later
and
try
to
collect
a
fine
from
them.
so
different
union
constitutions
treat
that
issue
in
different
ways.
mr.
laurence
stephen
gold
oh,
absolutely,
chief
justice.
the
argument
we
make
here
is
that
the
language
and
legislative
history
of
the
taft-hartley
act
shows
that
congress
gave
the
most
mature
and
complete
consideration
to
the
entire
question
of
the
extent
to
which
the
labor
board
should
be
empowered
to
regulate
the
union/member
relationship,
and
that
in
particular,
the
house
of
representatives
proposed
that
it
be
an
unfair
labor
practice
for
a
union
to
limit
resignation
in
any
way,
shape,
or
form;
where
the
senate
took
a
quite
different
view.
and
that
conference
report
demonstrates
in
this
instance,
as
in
many
others,
that
the
house
receded
to
the
senate.
in
other
words,
our
position
here
is
that
congress
made
a
considered
decision
to
deny
the
labor
board
the
authority
to
dictate
to
unions
what
their
rules
should
be
on
who
may
join
the
union,
the
conditions
under
which
that
person
may
join,
position,
the
conditions
under
which
he
may
be
expelled,
and
the
conditions
under
which
he
may
otherwise
leave
the
union.
mr.
laurence
stephen
gold
the
board
found
or
stated,
"there
is
no
contention
that
the
members
who
tended
their
resignations
were
unaware
of
the
restrictions
on
resignation
imposed
by
the
constitution.
"
mr.
laurence
stephen
gold
all
that
the
record
shows,
justice
brennan,
is
that
in
adopting
this
provision,
the
union
publicized
the
matter
to
the
full
membership,
and
the
membership
voted
on
whether
or
not
this
restriction
should
be
inserted
into
the
union
constitution.
mr.
laurence
stephen
gold
yes.
that
is
my
understanding.
they
were
members
at
that
time.
and
there
was
a
hiatus
from
august
1976
until
may
1977
between
the
time
the
provision
was
adopted
and
when
the
strike
began.
so
by
the
clear
terms
or
the
negative
implication
of
this
restriction,
each
one
of
these
members
was
free
each
one
of
those
days
to
say
i
don't
choose
to
be
a
member
of
this
association
any
longer.
this
is
a
narrow
and
pointed
restriction
on
the
ability
to
resign,
one
which
is
attendant
to
a
particular
moment
of
the
utmost
importance
to
the
organization,
the
strike
period
with
its
attendant
pressures,
and
the
period
during
which
the
employer
is
free
to
employ
such
coercive
devices,
perfectly
lawful
under
the
labor
laws,
as
hiring
permanent
replacements,
stating
an
intention
to
do
so,
and
so
on,
all
of
the
lawful
uses
of
economic
force
which
tend
to
pull
the
group
apart.
mr.
laurence
stephen
gold
i
read
the
board's
holding
to
be
firm
and
absolute.
mr.
laurence
stephen
gold
no
such
rule
as
the
board--
mr.
laurence
stephen
gold
--yes.
the
board,
in
terms
of
its
decision
and
also
in
its
brief,
more
particularly
addresses
the
question
of
waiver.
obviously,
mr.
fried
is
better
able
to
say
what's
in
the
board's
mind
than
i
am.
but
the
board's
decision
is
stated
in
absolute
terms,
and
certainly
against
the
background
of
this
case
where
the
provision
is
adopted
on
notice
by
a
referendum
vote,
not
even
by
elected
representatives,
it
is
hard
to
believe
when
you
read
the
board's
language,
which
is
that
any
restriction
placed
by
a
union
on
its
members'
right...
any
restrictions
placed
by
a
union
on
its
members'
right
to
resign
are
unlawful,
admits
of
any
exception.
mr.
laurence
stephen
gold
that's
right.
mr.
laurence
stephen
gold
yes.
our
primary
position
is
that
congress
made
a
basic
judgment.
mr.
laurence
stephen
gold
that's
correct.
mr.
laurence
stephen
gold
yes.
we
rest
on
the--
mr.
laurence
stephen
gold
--yes.
the
language...
it
seems
to
us
to
proceed
in
the
way
the
court
has
instructed
from
the
language
to
the
explanation.
the
language
is
hardly
helpful
to
the
government,
but--
mr.
laurence
stephen
gold
--that
is
what
i
was
about
to
say,
justice
white.
i
don't
think
it
is
very
helpful,
but
i
could
not
say--
mr.
laurence
stephen
gold
--forces
a
decision
in
our
favor.
i
do
think
the
language
cuts
in
our
favor
in
two
different
respects:
one,
the
section
7
right
is
a
right
to
refrain
from
concerted
activities,
and
it
seems
to
us
the
choice
of
the
word
"refrain"
is
a
surprising
one
to
denote
a
right
to
join
an
organization
which
has
a
rule
limiting
resignation,
and
say
i
will
join,
but
i
am
joining
free
and
clear
of
that
rule,
and
i
won't
respect
it
and
i
have
a
right
that
congress
gave
me
to
join
and
then
to
leave
at
will
any
time
i
say.
so
i
don't
think
the
language
pushes
in
the
government's
direction.
mr.
laurence
stephen
gold
i
think
that
the
argument...
and
we've
gone
back
and
forth
in
our
minds
whether
or
not
the
argument
is
a
waiver
or
an
argument
simply
that
this
is
a
narrow
right,
a
right
not
to
join
in
the
first
place.
secondly,
section
8(b)(1)(a)
was
not
in
the
senate
committee
bill.
it
was
added
on
the
floor
by
senators
taft
and
ball,
and
in
adding
it
they
excepted
an
amendment
by
senator
holland,
adding
the
proviso
to
the
amendment,
the
proviso
that
says
that
nothing
in
the
body
of
the
amendment
which
prohibits
restraint
and
coercion
is
intended
to
interfere
with
the
right
of
unions
to
prescribe
their
own
rules
with
respect
to
the
acquisition
or
retention
of
membership.
mr.
laurence
stephen
gold
i
think
that
this
is,
chief
justice,
the
kind
of
question
where
the
board
has
the
least
possible
elbow
room.
i
would
concede
that
if
all
that
i
had
to
present
to
you
was
the
bare
language
of
the
statute,
unexplained
by
its
evolution
and
by
what
its
sponsor
said,
that
this
might
be
an
area
in
which
the
board's
expertise
weighs
heavily.
but
that
is
simply
not
the
situation
here.
congress
was
considerate
enough,
good
enough
to
debate
these
matters
at
great
length.
and
what
we
see
is
(a),
as
i
was
saying
in
the
senate,
expressed
statement
by
the
sponsors
of
section
8(b)(1)(a)
that
they
had
no
intent
to
intervene
in
internal
union
affairs
and
to
regulate
the
union/member
relationship.
and
then
when
we
move
to
the
house,
we
find
a
very
different
situation.
in
the
house,
there
was
a
section
7(a)
in
the
house
bill,
very
much
like
section
7
now,
including
these
words
"granting
individual
employees
the
right
to
refrain
from
concerted
activities.
"
and
a
section
7(b)
which
regulated,
which
gave
union
members
rights,
vis
a
vis
the
labor
organization.
and
in
the
house
bill,
there
was
a
section
8(b)
which
is
very
much
like
section
8(b)(1)(a)
now,
dealing
with
this
general
question
of
restraint
and
coercion,
basically
physical
coercion
and
interference
with
job
rights.
mr.
laurence
stephen
gold
yes.
mr.
laurence
stephen
gold
no,
justice
white.
i
cannot
say
that
the
discussion
was
in
that
specificity,
but
the
discussion
was
as
follows.
we
reproduced
the
portions
of
the
statement
of
the
house
managers
who
would
certainly
take
the
kindest
view
as
to
what--
mr.
laurence
stephen
gold
--page
31
to
32.
and
i'd
like
to
read
it
at
the
bottom
of
the
page,
simply
to
give
the
background
to
this
statement.
the
house
passed
a
bill
that
had
a
section
7(b)
which
gave
rights
to
individuals
as
union
members
and
a
section
8(c)(4)
which
specifically
stated
that
union
members
would
have
a
right
to
resign
at
will,
and
that
it
was
an
unfair
labor
practice
to
limit
that
right.
the
bill
went
to
conference.
section
7(b)
and
8(c)
were
dropped.
the
house
conferees
said
section
8(c)
of
the
house
bill
contained
detailed
provisions
dealing
with
the
relations
of
labor
organizations
with
their
members.
one
of
the
more
important
provisions
of
this
section,
that
limiting
the
initiation
fees
which
a
labor
organization
may
impose,
where
a
permitted
union
shop
or
maintenance
of
membership
agreement
is
in
effect,
is
included
in
the
conference
agreement.
see
section
8(b)(5)
and,
has
already
been
discussed,
the
other
parts
of
this
subsection
are
omitted
from
the
conference
agreement
as
unfair
labor
practices.
the
house
managers
had
the
political
job
of
going
back
to
the
house
and
saying
we
salvaged
as
much
as
was
possible.
the
house
managers
did
not
admit
to
failure
in
that
regard
lightly.
there
is
just
no
doubt,
we
submit,
that
this
language
says
we
tried
to
regulate
internal
union
affairs;
we
succeeded
in...
we
tried
to
regulate
internal
union
affairs
in
section
7(b)
of
our
bill
and
8(c)
of
our
bill;
we
saved
section
8(b)(5)
on
initiation
fees;
we
lost
on
everything
else.
senator
taft
told
the
senate
that
with
regard
to
the
scope
of
8(b)(1)
which
he
and
senator
ball
had
said
was
not
intended
to
get
into
internal
union
affairs,
the
conference
bill
was
the
same
as
the
senate
bill.
now,
the
board
which
admits
that
all
of
these
materials
are
embodiments
of
congress'
will
and
have
to
be
explained,
says
that
while
no
one...
no
one...
so
stated
at
the
time,
the
real
agenda
of
the
conference
was
by
adding
the
words
the
7,
which
had
not
been
in
the
senate
bill,
it
was
the
intent
to
create
a
right
to
resign
at
will,
quite
aside
from
the
fact
that
that
doesn't
face
up
to
what
happened
to
section
7(b)
and
8(c)(4).
mr.
laurence
stephen
gold
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
laurence
stephen
gold
yes.
it
limits
it
in
this
respect.
neither
the
house
nor
the
senate
ever
claimed
that
section
7
or
7(a)
of
the
house
bill
or
section
8(b)(1)
regulated
internal
union
affairs
or
this
particular
aspect
of
internal
union
affairs.
and
indeed,
unless
the
board
is
correct
that
section
7(b)
and
8(c)(4)
of
the
house
bill
were
completely
redundant,
the
fair
inference
is
that
both
the
house
and
the
senate
saw
the
issue
of
regulating
union
activity
that
affects
job
rights
or
union
activity
that
involves
restraint
and
coercion
in
the
colloquial
sense,
harming
somebody
physically,
engaging
in
mass
picketing,
and
the
rest,
were
different
from
the
question
of
whether
congress
ought
to
regulate
the
union/member
relationship.
and
everything
in
the
senate,
the
explanations
of
the
addition
of
the
proviso
to
section
8(b)(1)(a),
the
failure
in
the
senate
bill
to
include
any
right
to
refrain,
the
statements
of
senator
ball--
mr.
laurence
stephen
gold
--that's
true,
but
you
voted
after
knowing
that
you
voted
for
a
very
different
house
bill,
and
that
your
appointed
representatives
came
back
and
in
black
and
white
said--
mr.
laurence
stephen
gold
--we
lost
a
lot
of
stuff.
and
one
of
the
things
they
lost
was
this.
mr.
laurence
stephen
gold
but
that's
the
argument
here.
the
argument
here
is
precisely
that
while
they
lost
that
unfair
labor
practice,
that
the
labor
board
has
the
power
under
8(b)(1)(a)
which
was
never
claimed
to
give
the
board
the
power,
the
authority
to
recreate
that
unfair
labor
practice,
and
to
do
so
out
of
whole
cloth.
mr.
laurence
stephen
gold
no.
i
don't
believe
that
that's
so
at
all.
the
textile
workers
case
and
all
of
the
decisions
through
the
court's
decision
in
machinists
&
boeing
say
that
the
union/member
relationship
is
no
greater
than
the
contract
created
by
the
union's
constitution,
and
that
union's
have
no
right
to
take
disciplinary
action
against
non-members
without
engaging
in
a
wrong.
the
question
here
is
whether
the
board
has
the
power
to
truncate
the
union
member
contract
by
substituting
its
view
that
there
is
something
somewhere
in
some
brooding
omnipresence
in
the
sky
that
says
that
every
union
rule
limiting
the
right
to
resign
is
an
unfair
labor
practice.
and
our
point
is
that
nothing
in
section
7(a),
nothing
in
section
7
as
enacted,
nothing
in
section
8(b)(1),
authorizes
the
board
to
create
that
unfair
labor
practice;
that
the
provision
to
8(b)(1)(a)
in
terms
denies
the
board
that
authority,
and
that
the
legislative
history
shows
that
section
7
was
not
intended
to
give
the
board
that
authority,
and
that
the
fate
of
sections
7(b)
and
8(c)(4)
demonstrates
that
this
was
not
an
issue
of
which
congress
was
unaware,
but
rather
an
issue
where
there
were
two
different
views.
the
house's
view
was
the
union/member
relationship
should
be
regulated,
regulated
in
detail,
and
in
particular
regulated
on
when
people
should
resign
the
view
of
the
senate
was
that
congress
should
not
move
to
that
point,
should
not
say
who
could
be
a
union
member,
how
long
he
would
be
a
union
member
if
he
chose
to
be
a
union
member,
and
when
he
would
get
out.
but
they
were
not
going
to
tell
the
unions
what
to
do
on
those
kinds
of
rules.
and
it
was
the
senate
view
that
prevailed,
and
the
board
here,
as
in
insurance
agents,
where
the
court
said
that
the
first
issue
is
did
congress
ask
the
board
to
answer
a
particular
question
and
said
that
it
had
not,
is
the
same
here.
the
board
just
has
not
been
given
the
authority
to
determine
what
union
resignation
rules
are
good
anymore
than
what
the
union
finds
are
reasonable.
these
matters
congress
left
where
it
found
them
until...
for
the
state
courts,
for
the
law
of
contracts,
for
the
law
of
membership
associations,
and
eventually
for
the
landram-griffin
act
where
this
matter
was
not
regulated
either.
mr.
laurence
stephen
gold
i
would
like
to
warmly
impress
on
the
court
judge
lernard
hand's
injunction
that
the
task
of
both
agencies
and
courts
is
to
recreate
the
gamut
of
values
extant
at
the
time
from
the
legislative
materials.
my
brother
fried
did
everything,
other
than
talk
about
what
congress
said
and
did.
and
the
overall
picture
he
drew,
i
would
suggest,
is
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
act.
what
is
self-organization?
what
is
freedom
of
association?
it
is
not,
and
was
not
in
congress's
eyes,
the
right
of
every
individual
to
join
the
organization
if
he
wishes
and
to
leave
if
he
wishes.
of
course,
the
very
point
of
the
proviso
was
to
recognize
that
freedom
of
association
is
a
group
freedom,
and
the
group
creates
its
rules
on
who
may
join
and
who
may
not
join.
an
individual
who
walks
up
to
a
union
and
says
i
want
to
join,
but
i
won't
abide
by
these
rules,
can
be
rejected
because
congress's
view
of
the
freedom
of
association
was
the
contractual
view,
the
view
stated
by
this
court
in
democratic
party
of
the
united
states,
and
not
the
view
that
mr.
fried
creates
out
of
whole
cloth,
and
that's
the
board,
without
paying
the
least
bit
of
attention
to
what
congress
was
willing
to
do
and
not
willing
to
do,
enacted.
this
bill
was
a
compromise.
the
issue
of
whether
there
would
be
a
perfect
freedom
to
join
and
leave
was
joined.
the
determination
was
that
there
would
be
a
different
contractual
relationship
of
the
kind
always
recognized
in
common
law.
there
is
no
case
saying
that
this
kind
of
restriction
is
no
good,
and
indeed
there
would
be
a
zero
issue
here
if,
under
the
normal
law
of
membership
associations,
these
kinds
of
restrictions
had
not
always
been
recognized.
mr.
laurence
stephen
gold
thank
you,
chief
justice.
