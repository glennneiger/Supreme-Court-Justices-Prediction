mr.
ennis...
oh,
excuse
me.
finish
your
answer.
justice
stevens
that's
good
background
for
the
question
i
was
going
to
ask
you
about
the
scope
of
your
position.
supposing
you
have
somebody
who's
nominated
to
the
cabinet,
or
district
attorney,
somebody
like
this.
justice
stevens
a
nominee
for
some
office
that
requires
confirmation
of
the
senate.
and
say
a
large
pressure
group
like
one
of
the
big
trade
associations
or
the
national
rifle
association
have
decided
to
oppose
him.
could
they
get
together
and
write
literally
thousands
of
false
letters
accusing
him
of
all
sorts
of
personal
wrongdoing
and
all
the
rest,
and
misstating
his
position
and
all
the
rest,
get
a
regular
campaign
going...
would
all
those
letters
be
immune
from
any
kind
of
libel
action?
justice
stevens
to
the
chairman
of
the
committee.
justice
stevens
which
is
probably
the
only
sanction
that's
available
for
deliberate
falsehood
of
that
kind.
justice
stevens
what
kind
of
a
constitutional
immunity
is
it
that
just
protects
you
from
a
civil
remedy
but
not
from
a
criminal
remedy?
justice
stevens
but
if
the...
i
am
still
a
little
puzzled.
if
the
communication
is
constitutionally
privileged,
notwithstanding
its
falsity,
how
can
you
be
satisfied
with
a
rule
that
would
allow
the
federal
government
to
prosecute
the
person
for
sending
the
same
communication?
justice
stevens
where
do
you
find
that
distinction
in
the
language
of
the
constitution?
justice
stevens
those
are...
as
justice
rehnquist
points
out,
those
are
not
constitutional
decisions.
justice
stevens
yes,
but
don't
we
have
to
assume
that
they
are
also
false,
and
deliberately
so,
for
purposes
of
deciding
the
case?
justice
stevens
no,
you
have
to
concede
that
your
client
sent
deliberately
false
letters,
knowingly...
i
mean
false
letters
that
he
knew
were
false.
that's
the
allegation
which
we
must
accept
as
true.
justice
stevens
but
for
purposes
of
your
appeal,
you
must
assume
it's
true.
justice
stevens
mr.
ennis,
would
your
rule
cover
the
anonymous
correspondent
as
well
as
one
who
signs
his
name?
justice
stevens
so
your
answer
is
yes,
it
would.
justice
stevens
do
you
think
the
rule
for
which
you
contend
would
have
any
tendency
to
increase
the
amount
of
false
communication?
justice
stevens
that's
not
my
question.
my
question
is,
do
you
think
the
rule
for
which
you
contend
would
have
any
tendency
to
increase
the
amount
of
false
communication?
