so
republican
form
of
government.
justice
marshall
that's
the
nearest...
i've
been
listening.
i'm
quite
interested.
that's
the
nearest
you've
gotten
to
point
to
any
provision
of
the
constitution,
and
you're
miles
away
from
that
one.
justice
marshall
i
think
it's
one
of
the
clearest
puddles
of
mud
i've
seen
in
a
long
time.
justice
marshall
well,
i
dispute
that
as
of
today,
you
can
write
anything
you
please
to
any
governmental
official
and
have
absolute
immunity.
justice
marshall
is
there
anything
that
you
could
write
to
the
government
that
you
would
not
be
responsible
for?
justice
marshall
the
point
is
that
you
write
to
a
government
official,
period.
justice
marshall
that's
all
you
say.
if
you
write
to
a
government
official,
you
have
absolute
immunity,
period.
that's
the
end
of
your
constitutional
provision.
justice
marshall
how
much
broader
is
it?
justice
marshall
i
said
anyone
in
government.
justice
marshall
i
don't
think
you
can
be
in
government
unofficially.
justice
marshall
also,
i
wouldn't
assume
it
would
apply
to
somebody
who
wrote
to
the
third
assistant
janitor
in
the
post
office.
justice
marshall
don't
break
anything...
bring
something
that's...
if
you
write
to
any
governmental
official--
justice
marshall
--any
officer
of
the
united
states,
you
have
absolute
immunity.
is
that
correct?
