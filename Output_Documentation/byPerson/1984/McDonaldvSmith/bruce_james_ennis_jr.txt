mr.
bruce
james
ennis,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court,
the
question
is
whether
the
federal
government's
need
to
obtain
information
about
candidates
seeking
appointment
to
federal
office,
together
with
the
right
of
a
citizen
to
provide
that
information
in
a
petition
addressed
only
to
appropriate
federal
officials,
requires
the
same
immunity
from
common
law
libel
actions
this
court
has
already
afforded
both
citizens
and
governmental
officials
in
a
broad
range
of
other
circumstances
in
which
providing
only
qualified
immunity
would
unduly
impair
the
effective
functioning
of
government.
in
each
of
those
other
circumstances,
the
fact
that
immunity
would
protect
not
only
truthful
and
useful
communications,
but
also,
on
occasion,
knowingly
false
and
defamatory
communications,
has
been
considered
a
necessary
cost
of
government.
as
justice
harlan
wrote
for
the
court
in
barr
v.
matteo,
affording
executive
officials
immunity
from
libel
actions
alleging
knowing
falsity,
"it
has
been
thought
in
the
end
better
to
leave
unredressed
the
wrongs
done
by
dishonest
officers
than
to
subject
those
who
try
to
do
their
duty
to
the
constant
dread
of
retaliation.
"
mr.
bruce
james
ennis,
jr.
no,
your
honor,
i
do
not.
i
believe
that
barr
v.
matteo
and
other
decisions
of
this
court
affording
immunity
to
governmental
officials
is
not
based
on
any
specific
clause
of
the
constitution.
none
was
referred
to.
but
i
do
believe
they
were
constitutional
decisions
in
the
sense
that
the
court
felt
that
the
very
constitutional
structure
of
our
government
required
such
immunity.
mr.
bruce
james
ennis,
jr.
your
honor,
there
is
not
a
word
about
the
constitution
in
barr
v.
matteo,
but
the
court
nevertheless
thought,
even
though
there
was
no
constitutional
right
of
a
governmental
official
at
issue,
that
the
effective
functioning
of
the
government
itself
was
sufficient
to
require
the
rule
of
immunity.
in
this
case,
we
have
not
only
that
same
governmental
interest,
but
in
addition
the
interest
of
the
citizen
critic
expressly
grounded
in
the
petition
clause
of
the
first
amendment.
mr.
bruce
james
ennis,
jr.
the
case
has
not
yet
been
tried,
your
honor.
mr.
bruce
james
ennis,
jr.
it
would
be
tried
under
north
carolina
libel
law
as
that
law
is
modified
and
governed
by
the
federal
constitution
and
also
by
the
needs
of
the
federal
government
to
receive
information.
for
example,
the
court
has
also
ruled,
not
relying
on
any
specific
constitutional
provision,
that
citizens
have
a
right
to
provide
information
about
criminal
offenses
to
government;
they
have
a
right
to
testify
before
legislative
and
judicial
bodies;
and
they
have
a
right
to
provide
petitions
to
the
judicial
branch
of
government,
and
they
would
be
absolutely
immune
from
libel
actions
in
each
of
those
circumstances.
we
seek
no
more
in
this
case.
in
our
view,
there
are
two
separate
but
in
this
case
coinciding
interests
which
require
immunity.
the
first
is
the
interest
of
the
federal
government
in
effective
functioning
and
the
second
is
the
interest
of
the
citizen
critic
in
providing
the
information
the
government
needs
to
function
effectively.
the
basic
facts--
mr.
bruce
james
ennis,
jr.
--justice
white,
i
know
that
you
have
taken
pains
to
concur
in
several
decisions
stressing
that
the
constitution
does
not
directly
protect
knowingly
false
information.
mr.
bruce
james
ennis,
jr.
yes,
the
court
has
agreed
with
that,
your
honor.
mr.
bruce
james
ennis,
jr.
we
do
not
contend
that
it
does,
and
we
do
not
need
to
contend
that
it
does.
mr.
bruce
james
ennis,
jr.
that's
exactly
the
argument
that
this
court
has
already
accepted.
mr.
bruce
james
ennis,
jr.
they
are--
mr.
bruce
james
ennis,
jr.
--your
honor,
we
are
not
seeking
protection
for
the
right
to
knowingly
lie.
mr.
bruce
james
ennis,
jr.
your
honor,
we're
seeking
protection
for
the
right
to
petition
the
government
and
to
provide
information
to
the
government.
mr.
bruce
james
ennis,
jr.
even
if
there
may
occasionally
be
knowing
lies
in
the
process.
mr.
bruce
james
ennis,
jr.
his
basis,
your
honor,
is
the
same
basis
that
the
united
states
itself
identified
in
the
case
of
webb
v.
fury.
we
don't
have
to
speculate
about
the
federal
interest.
in
webb
v.
fury,
the
united
states
formally
and
explicitly
took
the
position
that
citizens
should
be
absolutely
immune
from
common
law
libel
actions
when
they
provide
petitions
to
federal
agencies,
even
if
those
petitions
are
alleged
to
be
knowingly
false.
the
reason,
said
the
government,
was--
mr.
bruce
james
ennis,
jr.
--pardon
me,
your
honor?
mr.
bruce
james
ennis,
jr.
alleged
to
be.
that
is
all
that
is
true
in
this
case
as
well,
your
honor.
the
reason
for
that
was
that
any
lesser
degree
of
immunity,
said
the
united
states,
would
deprive
the
government
of
the
information
it
needs
to
govern.
mr.
bruce
james
ennis,
jr.
because
both
governmental
officials
and
citizens
would
be
deterred
from
providing
truthful
and
useful
information
to
the
government
if
they
knew
that
merely
upon
an
allegation
that
their
communications
were
knowingly
false,
they
would
be
required
to
spend
literally
thousands
of
dollars
in
unrecoverable
defense
costs
to
defend
the
truth
of
their
statements.
that
would
silence
both
governmental
officials
and
citizen
critics
from
providing
the
information
government
needs.
mr.
bruce
james
ennis,
jr.
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
bruce
james
ennis,
jr.
the
united
states
went
to
the
extraordinary
length
of
filing
both
an
amicus
brief
and
an
amicus
reply
brief.
mr.
bruce
james
ennis,
jr.
no,
they
have
not,
your
honor.
i
think
that
the
interest
of
the
federal
government
is
on
its
face
and,
given
webb
v.
fury,
quite
clear.
but
if
there
be
any
doubt
about
that,
the
court
could
of
course
invite
the
solicitor
general
to
follow
through.
mr.
bruce
james
ennis,
jr.
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
bruce
james
ennis,
jr.
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
bruce
james
ennis,
jr.
that
is
correct,
your
honor,
and
it
raises
a
very
important
distinction.
witnesses
who
testify
in
judicial
proceedings
are
not
immune
from
perjury
prosecutions,
but
they
are
immune
from
common
law
libel
actions.
we
are
not
seeking
immunity
from
every
possible
sanction.
for
example,
the
federal
government
has
already
made
it
a
crime
to
provide
false
information
to
the
government,
whether
it's
defamatory
of
a
third
party
or
not.
we
are
not
seeking
immunity
from
that
kind
of
prosecution
or
from
other
sanctions.
we
are
only
seeking
the
same
immunity
from
common
law
libel
actions
that
witnesses
in
judicial
proceedings
already
have.
mr.
bruce
james
ennis,
jr.
some
witnesses,
your
honor,
are
there
other
than
by
their
free
will.
others
are
there
by
their
own
free
will.
but
the
doctrine--
mr.
bruce
james
ennis,
jr.
--that's
certainly
correct,
your
honor,
but
the
rule
applies
not
only
to
witnesses;
even
persons
who
simply
file
complaints
with
the
judicial
branch
are
absolutely
immune
from
common
law
libel
actions
based
on
the
statements
contained
in
their
complaints,
and
no
one
has
compelled
them
to
file
such
a
complaint.
mr.
bruce
james
ennis,
jr.
i
see
no
compelling
justification
for
affording
petitions
to
the
judicial
branch
of
government
immunity
from
common
law
libel
actions,
and
not
affording
the
same
immunity
for
petitions
to
the
legislative
and
executive
branches,
particularly
when
the
petition
is
directly
relevant
to
an
important
decision
then
under
consideration
by
the
executive
and
legislative
branches.
there
is
no
presumption,
if
i
may
say
so,
your
honor,
that
it
is
more
important
to
protect
petitions
to
the
judicial
branch
than
it
is
to
protect
petitions
the
president
and
to
the
legislative
branch.
mr.
bruce
james
ennis,
jr.
i'm
sorry.
i
did
not
hear.
mr.
bruce
james
ennis,
jr.
your
honor,
so
long...
under
our
theory
of
the
case,
so
long
as
the
letters
were
addressed
to
appropriate
officials
of
the
federal
government--
mr.
bruce
james
ennis,
jr.
--who
were
then
considering
a
governmental
decision,
yes,
they
would
be
immune,
not
from
all
sanctions,
but
from
common
law
civil
libel
actions.
mr.
bruce
james
ennis,
jr.
well,
as
i've
indicated,
there
are
already
on
the
books
statutes
making
it
a
crime
to
provide
false
information
to
the
federal
government,
and
he
certainly
could
be
prosecuted
for
that.
it
is
also
conceivable,
though
i
do
not
concede
the
point,
that
a
state
criminal
prosecution
for
criminal
libel
could
be
pursued,
though
i
am
not
willing
to
concede
that
such
a
prosecution
would
survive
constitutional--
mr.
bruce
james
ennis,
jr.
--well,
as
i
say,
the
federal
criminal
remedy
would
be
different.
it
would
not
be
for
the
crime
of
providing
defamatory
information.
it
would
be
for
the
crime
of
providing
false
information
to
the
government,
whether
it
was
defamatory
or
not.
it
is
a
crime,
for
example,
to
provide
false
information
to
the
fbi.
mr.
bruce
james
ennis,
jr.
because,
your
honor,
i'm
making
the
same
distinction
i
made
in
response
to
the
question
asked
by
justice
o'connor,
and
that
is,
we
are
not
seeking
immunity
from
every
conceivable
sanction.
we
are
only
seeking
immunity
from
one
particular
sanction
which
is
particularly
likely
to
silence
critics
of--
mr.
bruce
james
ennis,
jr.
--i
find
that
distinction
in
this
court's
decisions.
this
court
has
already
ruled
that
judges,
legislators,
and
executive
officials
are
immune,
not
from
every
sanction,
but
immune
from
common
law
libel
actions,
even
if
their
statements
are
alleged
to
be
defamatory
and
knowingly
false.
the
court--
mr.
bruce
james
ennis,
jr.
--i
believe
they
are
constitutional
in
the
sense,
your
honor,
that
they
derive
from
the
very
structure
of
a
republican
form
of
government.
they
are
like
the
slaughterhouse
cases,
like
in
re
quarles,
like
all
of
the
foundation
cases
on
which
our
constitution
and
jurisprudence
is
based.
the
court
in
every
one
of
those
cases
said
that
that
kind
of
immunity,
in
the
circumstances
of
that
case,
was
necessary
in
order
to
ensure
the
effective
functioning
of
government.
that's
the
literal
language
used
in
those
cases.
i
see
no
distinction
here.
the
government
was
actively
considering
an
important
governmental
decision...
whether
to
appoint
respondent
to
the
office
of
united
states
attorney,
the
chief
law
enforcement
office
in
the
middle
district
of
north
carolina.
that
was
obviously
an
important
decision.
it
required
nomination
by
the
president
and
the
advice
and
consent
of
the
senate.
this
was
not
some
low
level
margin
decision.
in
order
to
make
a
responsible
and
effective
decision
on
that
candidacy,
the
government
needed
to
obtain
relevant
information.
the
letters
that
my
client
sent
to
the
president
are,
on
their
face,
highly
relevant
to
the
qualifications
of
respondent
for
that
office.
but
if
my
client
knew--
mr.
bruce
james
ennis,
jr.
--your
honor,
i
have
to
concede
that
the
rule
i
am
arguing
for
would
protect
not
only
truthful
communications--
mr.
bruce
james
ennis,
jr.
--that's
the
allegation
of
the
complaint.
it
is
specifically
denied
in
the
answer.
this
case
does
not
arise
simply
on
a
motion
to
dismiss.
mr.
bruce
james
ennis,
jr.
i
don't
want
to
quibble
with
you,
your
honor.
i
do
want
to
make
a
point,
however,
that
this
is
not
just
a
motion
to
dismiss.
it's
a
motion
for
judgment
on
the
pleadings,
which
includes
the
answer
as
well
as
the
complaint.
nevertheless,
i
would
assume
for
purposes
of
this
case
that
even
if
what
my
client
wrote
is
knowingly
false,
it
should
be
absolutely
protected
because
it
is
the
right
of
the
federal
government
to
decide
for
itself
how
to
separate
the
false
from
the
true.
the
federal
government
certainly
has
mechanisms
for
doing
that.
this
letter
was
in
fact
addressed,
one
copy,
to
william
webster,
the
director
of
the
fbi
who
has
statutory
authority
to
investigate
candidates
for
appointment
to
this
very
federal
office.
and
the
fbi
certainly
has
enormous
resources
for
ferreting
out
truth
and
falsity.
mr.
bruce
james
ennis,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
if
you
were
making
a
decision
whether
to
hire
a
certain
person,
for
example,
as
your
law
clerk
and
if
a
citizen
had
information
concerning
the
qualifications
of
that
person,
i
would
take
the
position
that
the
citizen
would
have
the
right
to
send
you
a
letter
expressing
his
views
and
that
those
views
would
be
immune
from
a
civil
libel
action,
though
not
from
other
possible
sanctions,
whether
they
are
true
or
false.
mr.
bruce
james
ennis,
jr.
your
honor,
both
because--
mr.
bruce
james
ennis,
jr.
--your
honor,
both
because
of
republican
form
of
government...
that's
the
federal
interest...
and
also
because
of
the
petition
clause
of
the
first
amendment.
the
history
of
the
petition
clause,
i
think,
is
overwhelmingly
clear.
in
fact,
the
respondent
does
not
even
deny--
mr.
bruce
james
ennis,
jr.
--well,
your
honor,
i
don't
wish
to
seem
disrespectful,
but
in
our
brief
we
refer
to
the
fact
that
in
a
parliamentary
resolution
of
1669,
in
lake
v.
king
in
1680,
in
the
seven
bishops
case
of
1688,
in
the
english
bill
of
rights
of
1689,
in
a
host
of
other
authorities,
english
law
that
was
known
to
the
framers
provided
absolute
immunity
to
british
subjects
when
they
petitioned
either
parliament
or
the
king.
the
respondents
do
not
dispute
that
history.
they
also
do
not
dispute
that
in
harris
v.
huntington,
the
first
american
case
to
consider
the
common
law--
mr.
bruce
james
ennis,
jr.
--well,
your
honor,
if
i
wrote
a
letter
to
the
government
accusing--
mr.
bruce
james
ennis,
jr.
--i'm
not
claiming--
mr.
bruce
james
ennis,
jr.
--right.
mr.
bruce
james
ennis,
jr.
no.
that
is
a
broader
rule
than
we
are
contending
for
in
this
case.
mr.
bruce
james
ennis,
jr.
quite
a
bit
broader.
we
are
only
asking
the
court
to
rule
in
the
narrow
circumstances
of
this
case,
and
that
involves
three
important
qualifications.
the
first
is
that
the
petition
is
from
a
citizen
addressed
to
appropriate
officials
of
the
federal
government,
not
just
to
anyone.
second--
mr.
bruce
james
ennis,
jr.
--yes,
but
we're
not...
if
mr....
if
my
client--
mr.
bruce
james
ennis,
jr.
--no,
certainly
not,
your
honor.
but
if
my
client
wrote
a
letter
to
some
member
of
the
forestry
department
in
the
state
of
wisconsin...
who's
a
government
official...
which
was
defamatory--
mr.
bruce
james
ennis,
jr.
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
that's
an
important
qualification.
mr.
bruce
james
ennis,
jr.
yes.
mr.
bruce
james
ennis,
jr.
that's
not
the
position
for
which
we
are--
mr.
bruce
james
ennis,
jr.
--your
honor,
we
are
limiting
the
rule
we
see
to
appropriate
federal
officials.
that
could
include
certainly
those
officials
who
are
directly
involved
in
making
the
decision.
for
example,
as
you
might
be,
if
you
were
hiring
a
law
clerk.
but
it
might
also
include
a
few
more
officials
who
are
not
directly
involved
in
making
the
decision,
but
whom
the
petitioner
could
reasonably
believe
would
be
influential
in
that
decisionmaking
process.
the
citizen
critic
should
not
be
forced
to
guess
at
his
peril,
whether
the
governmental
recipients
of
his
petition
are
the
right
recipients
or
not.
so
long
as
his
decision
is
not
patently
unreasonable,
as
perhaps
writing
to
the
third
janitor
might
be,
so
long
as
decisions
are
not
patently
unreasonable,
it
should
be
protected.
let
me
continue
by
saying
that--
mr.
bruce
james
ennis,
jr.
--well,
your
honor,
i
must
respectfully
disagree
about
the
common
law
history.
but
on
the
other
question
you
asked,
that
is
obviously
an
important
point;
that
witnesses
in
judicial
proceedings
are
subject
to
cross-examination.
the
rule,
however,
of
immunity
applies
not
only
to
witnesses
but
also
to
complainants
in
judicial
proceedings.
the
complaint
itself
is
immune.
and
there
may
or
may
not
be
occasion
for
testing
the
truth
of
allegations
in
a
complaint.
the
complaint
may
never
get
served,
it
may
not--
mr.
bruce
james
ennis,
jr.
--yes,
that's
right.
mr.
bruce
james
ennis,
jr.
yes.
let
me
respond
to
that,
your
honor.
mr.
bruce
james
ennis,
jr.
let
me
respond
to
that,
your
honor,
because
that's
very
similar
to
one
argument
raised
by
the
respondent
that
this
was
a
secret
petition.
in
fact,
it
was
not,
for
four
reasons.
first,
a
secret--
mr.
bruce
james
ennis,
jr.
--the
rule
i
propose
is
no
different
than
the
rule
this
court
has
already
adopted
in
both
quarles
and
vogel
v.
gruz.
this
court
has
already
ruled
that
the
subject
of
a
petition
to
the
federal
government
cannot
compel
the
disclosure
of
that
petition
to
himself
or
to
anyone
else
without
the
"permission
or
assent"
of
the
federal
government.
because
the
court
recognized
that
the
government
has
such
an
important
need
in
receiving
that
information,
that
the
federal
government
should
be
free
to
decide
for
itself
whether
to
pass
on
a
communication
to
the
subject
of
the
communication.
that's
already
the
rule
this
court
has
adopted.
third--
mr.
bruce
james
ennis,
jr.
--well,
vogel
applies
not
just
in
criminal
cases,
nor
does...
but
the
rule
i'm
talking
about
is
a
petition
to
federal
government.
the
fourth
point
i'd
like
to
make
on
that
secrecy
argument
is
that
the
respondent,
i
think
disingenuously
suggests
in
his
answering
brief,
that
he
did
not
have
an
ample
opportunity
to
respond.
in
fact,
he
did.
the
record
in
this
case
is
clear,
as
the
deposition
of
congressman
johnston
makes
clear,
that
the
respondent
promptly
received
copies
of
both
letters
from
congressman
johnston,
his
friend,
and
senator
helms,
his
friend
and
sponsor,
and
that
on
january
19th
and
february
27th
he
in
fact
wrote
to
congressman
johnston
with
enclosures,
providing
a
detailed
response
to
every
one
of
petitioner's
allegations.
so
he
did
in
fact
have
an
ample
opportunity
to
respond,
and
that's
in
the
record
of
this
case.
this
was
not
a
secret,
however.
a
secret
requires
an
agreement
by
both
parties
to
the
communications
to
keep
it
confidential
between
themselves.
my
client
did
not
demand
or
request
that
the
government
keep
his
petition
secret.
to
the
contrary,
he
offered
to
testify
publicly,
where
he
would
have
been
subject
to
cross-examination
and
penalties
for
perjury;
nor
did
he
expect
secrecy.
he
is
alleged
to
have
sent
copies
of
his
letters
to
senator
helms
and
congressman
johnston,
both
of
whom
were
friends
and
sponsors
of
the
respondent.
mr.
bruce
james
ennis,
jr.
your
honor,
i
think
that
the
federal
government
should
be
free
to
decide
for
itself
whether
it
wants
to
receive
and
act
upon
anonymous
petitions
as
well
as--
mr.
bruce
james
ennis,
jr.
--yes,
it
would,
but
i
don't
think
the
court
needs
to--
mr.
bruce
james
ennis,
jr.
--no
more,
your
honor,
than
the
rule
this
court
adopted
in
barr
v.
matteo
for
governmental
officials.
mr.
bruce
james
ennis,
jr.
no,
i
do
not
think
it
would,
your
honor,
because
the
petitioner
would
still
be
subject
to
penalties
for
providing
false
information
to
the
government.
on
the
contrary,
though,
i
think
that
a
rule
granting
petitioner's
immunity
from
common
law
libel
actions
would
tend
to
encourage
citizens
to
provide
truthful
and
useful
information
to
the
government
because
they
would
no
longer
have
to
fear
spending
$20,
$4o,
$60,
$80,000
in
unrecoverable
defense
costs
if
their
communication
was
simply
alleged
to
be
knowingly
false.
let
me
respond
to
one
point
that
has
not
yet
come
up,
but
is...
since
the
respondent
really
says
virtually
nothing
at
all
about
our
historical
argument
that
was
known
to
the
framers
and
nothing
at
all
about
our
functional
analysis
argument,
respondent
talks
only
about
the
petitions
being
secret
and
misdirected.
the
argument
about
misdirected
is
that
petitioner's
first
letter
was
misdirected
because
he
sent
it
to
congressman-elect
johnston
and
to
president-elect
reagan
before
they
had
been
sworn
in.
but
as
the
record
makes
clear,
in
november
of
'80
the
respondent
had
applied
for
the
position
to
congressman-elect
johnson
and
to
senator
helms
requesting
their
assistance
in
obtaining
the
appointment.
if
it
was
appropriate
for
the
respondent
to
seek
the
assistance
of
congressman-elect
johnston
in
obtaining
the
appointment,
it
was
no
less
appropriate
for
the
petitioner
to
write
to
the
same
congressman-elect
johnson
to
oppose
the
appointment.
it
was
widely
reported
in
the
press
that
there
was
a
transition
team
in
place,
chaired
by
ed
meese,
that
was
then
actively
considering
nominations.
in
fact,
the
respondent
alleges
that
he
was
an
active
candidate,
and
that
the
president
would
be
making
appointments
as
soon
after
he
was
sworn
in
as
possible.
there
is
no
more
appropriate
occasion
for
a
citizen
to
communicate
with
the
federal
government
concerning
a
candidate
for
federal
office
than
when
the
decisionmaking
process
is
actively
underway.
let
me
conclude...
and
then
i'd
like
to
reserve
a
few
minutes
for
rebuttal...
by
simply
reminding
the
court,
as
i'm
sure
it's
aware,
that
the
deterrent
effect
we
are
talking
about
here
is
an
extraordinarily
severe
deterrent
effect.
in
fact,
the
respondent
concedes
at
page
18
of
his
brief
that
the
potential
cost
of
defending
a
libel
action
is
great,
to
use
the
respondent's
words.
and
the
relative
cost
for
an
ordinary
citizen
who
does
not
have
libel
defense
insurance
is
even
greater
than
the
cost
for
a
media
defendant,
such
as
the
new
york
times.
let
me
pose
a
hypothetical.
if
north
carolina
tomorrow
enacted
a
statute
imposing
a
$20,000
tax
on
all
petitions
to
the
federal
government,
can
anyone
doubt
that
that
would
silence
all
petitions
to
the
federal
government
by
everyone
but
the
most
wealthy
or
foolhardy
citizen?
but
the
$20,000
tax,
though
it's
not
paid
to
the
state
of
north
carolina,
is
the
same
in
this
case
under
the
common
law
rule.
the
petitioner
must
pay
that
$20,000
to
his
defense
lawyers
and
to
court
reporters,
not
to
the
state
of
north
carolina
directly,
but
the
cost
to
him
is
the
same
and
the
deterrent
effect
on
him
is
the
same.
if
this
court
does
not
grant
absolute
immunity,
i
think
it
is
clear
that
the
message
that
will
go
out
to
the
citizens
of
this
country
is
that
they
are
no
longer
free
to
criticize
candidates
or
to
criticize
wrongdoing
by
public
officials,
and
that
if
they
do
so,
they
do
so
at
enormous
economic
cost
to
themselves.
mr.
bruce
james
ennis,
jr.
it's
going
to
cost
my
client
the
same
amount
of
money
to
prove
that
his
allegations
were
true,
and
it
doesn't
matter
that
they're
simply
alleged
to
be
false;
he
has
to
incur
the
same
costs.
i
believe
i
have--
mr.
bruce
james
ennis,
jr.
--your
honor,
i
think
that
white
v.
nicholls
was,
as
this
court
recognized
in
briscoe
v.
la
hue,
an
incorrect
summary
of
the
common
law.
white
v.
nicholls
totally
ignores
the
pre-revolutionary
cases.
it
ignores
harris
v.
huntington
which
was
cited
here.
mr.
bruce
james
ennis,
jr.
your
honor,
i
don't
know
because
we
really
stopped
our
research
at
the
time
of
the
framers--
mr.
bruce
james
ennis,
jr.
--i
don't
know,
and
if
there
were,
i
don't
think
it
would
be
relevant
because
we're
inclined
to
see
the
case
law
that
would
have
been
familiar
to
the
framers
of
the
petition
clause.
and
cases
decided
contemporaneously
with
white
v.
nicholls
may
have
been
familiar
to
this
court
from
white
v.
nicholls,
but
could
not
possibly
have
been
within
the
contemplation
of
the
framers.
i
meant
to
reserve
a
couple
of
minutes,
but
i
guess
my
time
has
expired.
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
bruce
james
ennis,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
the
respondent
raised
the
point
about
public
debate.
first,
there
is
no
allegation
in
the
complaint
that
my
client,
the
petitioner,
distributed
copies
of
this
letter
to
any
member
of
the
public,
only
to
federal
officials.
there
was
a
very
good
reason
why
he
did
not
distribute
his
letter
to
the
public
and
give
an
opportunity
for
public
debate.
he
was
seeking
to
exercise
his
right
to
petition
the
federal
government
concerning
a
decision
that
was
about
to
be
made
by
the
federal
government,
and
there
was
no
arguable
basis
to
believe
that
the
public
would
be
able
to
redress
that
particular
grievance.
second,
by
limiting
his
petition
to
officials
of
the
federal
government,
he
obviously
limited
any
damage
to
the
reputational
interest
that
the
candidate
might
have
in
his
local
home
community.
and
while
i'm
on
that
point,
let
me
simply
state
that
this
court's
decisions
in
gertz
and
monitor
and
hutchinson
make
clear
that
although
reputation
is
an
important
interest,
the
reputational
interest
of
a
candidate
for
office
is
greatly
diminished
because
candidates
invite
scrutiny
of
their
qualifications
and
reputation.
second,
justice
o'connor
asked
whether
or
not
a
rule
of
good
faith
or
qualified
immunity
would
be
important
and
might
not
be
sufficient.
let
me
simply
refer
to
the
position
taken
by
the
united
states
in
webg
v.
fury
which
is
quoted
at
page
40
of
our
brief,
in
which
the
united
states
said:
"to
allow
a
plaintiff
to
simply
plead
bad
faith
would
create
a
chilling
effect
on
the
exercise
of
the
right
to
petition.
"
the
united
states
continued
that
the
right
to
petition
would
"lose
any
real
meaning
because
private
citizens
will
be
deterred
by
the
threat
of
litigation
from
exercising
that
right
which
would
deprive
the
federal
government
of
the
information
it
needs
to
govern.
"
let
me
conclude
by
simply
stating
once
again
that
we
are
not
seeking
absolute
immunity
from
every
possible
sanction
for
every
communication
that
could
conceivably
be
deemed
a
petition.
we
only
seek
immunity
from
common
law
libel
actions
and
only
in
the
three
circumstances
of
this
case.
first,
the
petition
was
from
a
citizen
to
appropriate
officials
of
the
federal
government;
second,
the
petition
was
relevant
to
the
qualifications
of
a
candidate
actively
seeking
appointment
to
federal
office;
and
third,
the
petition
was
made
on
an
appropriate
occasion
while
the
federal
decision
concerning
appointment
was
still
pending.
thank
you
very
much.
