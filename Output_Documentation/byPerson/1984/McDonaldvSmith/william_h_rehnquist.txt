mr.
ennis,
do
you
read
any
constitutional
dimension
into
barr
v.
matteo?
justice
rehnquist
i
never
read
barr
v....
i
don't
think
there's
a
word
about
the
constitution
in
barr
v.
matteo.
i've
always
thought
it
was
a
district
of
columbia
doctrine.
justice
rehnquist
well,
what's
the
source
of
the
law
we're
dealing
with
here?
is
it
all...
is
it
just
constitutional
law?
the
case
was
tried
under
north
carolina
libel
laws,
wasn't
it?
justice
rehnquist
would
it
be
tried
under
north
carolina
libel
law?
justice
rehnquist
webb
v.
fury,
was
that
a
case
in
the
supreme
court
of
west
virginia?
justice
rehnquist
and
what?
the
government
filed
an
amicus
brief?
justice
rehnquist
have
they
filed
any
brief
in
this
case?
justice
rehnquist
i
think
the
solicitor
general
is
usually
quite
aware
when
he
figures
the
government's
interests
are
involved.
justice
rehnquist
--but
don't
you
think
a
half
million
dollars
would
be
quite
chilling?
[laughter]
in
north
carolina?
