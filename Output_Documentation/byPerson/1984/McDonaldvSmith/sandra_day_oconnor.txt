justice
o'connor
mr.
ennis,
if
a
witness
testifies
in
court,
even
in
a
matter
of
grave
concern
to
the
government,
if
the
witness
testifies
falsely,
the
witness
can
be
tried
for
perjury,
can
he
not?
justice
o'connor
and
yet
there
certainly
is
as
great
an
interest
in
those
circumstances
in
obtaining
truthful
information,
both
for
the
government
and
from
the
witness's
standpoint.
and
i
take
it
in
those
circumstances,
the
witness
isn't
deterred
from
giving
the
truth,
speaking
the
truth,
because...
despite
the
threat
of
prosecution
for
perjury.
isn't
that
right?
justice
o'connor
mr.
ennis,
isn't
there
a
basic
difference
in
the
justification
for
immunity
and
libel
or
defamation
actions
for
witnesses
in
judicial
proceedings,
simply
because
they're
subject
to
cross-examination
to
get
at
the
truth?
their
statements
occur
in
a
framework
where
it's
possible
to
know
whether
they're
speaking
the
truth
or
not,
at
least
by
our
standards.
and
you're
asking
for
absolute
immunity
in
a
situation
where
someone
just
submits
a
letter
and
is
not
open
to
cross-examination
for
it.
and
it
seems
to
me
to
have
some
basic
differences.
and
i
think
if
you
look
closely
at
the
common
law
immunity,
you
will
find
that
it
extended
really
only
to
judicial
proceedings
and
witnesses
and
not
as
you
have
described.
justice
o'connor
well,
they
can
have
the
opportunity
for
a
formal
response.
it's
in
a
setting
where
it
lends
itself
to
a
response.
justice
o'connor
and
in
the
situation
you
described,
the
person
about
whom
the
letter
is
written
may
never
know
what
was
written
at
all.
justice
o'connor
there's
no
notice,
there's
no
response.
justice
o'connor
but
the
rule
you
pose
would
cover
something
just
submitted
that
the
person
about
whom
it's
written
would
never
know.
justice
o'connor
you
mean
in
criminal
cases.
is
that
what
you're
talking
about?
justice
o'connor
mr.
ennis,
what
do
you
think
the
message
was
to
someone
who
read
white
v.
nicholls?
justice
o'connor
do
you
know
of
another
american
case
before
white
v.
nicholls
that
adopted
the
harris
huntington
approach?
can
you
cite
one?
justice
o'connor
well,
i
haven't
been
able
to
find
one,
so
i
would
be
interested
if
you
had
one.
i
didn't
think
there
were
any.
justice
o'connor
do
you
agree
that
there
should
be
immunity
for
a
good
faith
statement
not
made
maliciously?
justice
o'connor
and
the
standard
which
this
action
would
go
to
trial
would
be
the
equivalent
of
the
standard
required
under
new
york
times
v.
sullivan
as
you
understand
it?
justice
o'connor
well,
do
you
tend
to
agree
that
anything
short
of
that
standard
certainly
would
provide
a
significant
chilling
effect
on
people
who
otherwise
might
furnish
information
to
public
officials?
justice
o'connor
do
you
think
it's
desirable
that
appointed
officials
for
public
positions
be
made
aware
of
even
reasonable
rumors
that
are
floating
around
about
people
that
they
might
be
considering
for
appointment?
is
that
desirable?
justice
o'connor
well,
that's
not
the
question
i
asked...
what
do
they
do
with
it.
justice
o'connor
i'm
asking
initially
if
you
think
that
as
a
matter
of
public
policy,
it's
desirable
that
as
much
information
as
possible
be
funneled
into
appointing
authorities,
even
if
it
consists
only
of
rumors.
