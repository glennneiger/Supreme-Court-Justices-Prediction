mr.
william
a.
eagles
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court,
over
20
years
ago
this
court
decided
new
york
times
v.
sullivan.
in
that
case
the
court
set
out
the
protection
the
constitution
makes
available
to
citizens
who
criticize
public
officials.
the
citizens
in
question
in
new
york
times
were
not
petitioning
the
government.
they
were,
however,
petitioning
the
holders
of
the
absolute
sovereignty
in
this
country;
they
were
petitioning
their
fellow
citizens.
new
york
times,
addressing
the
free
speech
and
press
clauses,
recognized
that
actual
malice
must
be
shown
to
be
the
basis
of
any
recovery
from
a
libel
action
for
criticizing
a
federal
official
or
government
official.
now
mr.
mcdonald
comes
before
this
court
and
seeks
absolute
immunity
for
letters
alleged
to
have
contained
knowing,
malicious
defamatory
falsehoods.
new
york
times
standard
would
not
protect
such
intentional
lies.
yet,
mr.
mcdonald
really
offers
only
arguments
that
were
addressed,
weighed,
balanced,
and
decided
in
new
york
times.
mr.
william
a.
eagles
i
don't
know
offhand,
your
honor.
we
are
here
denying
that
malicious
lies
are
afforded
a
protection
under
the
petition
clause;
that
the
same
malicious
lies
would
be
denied
by
the
free
speech
and
press
clauses.
yesterday,
this
court
affirmed
the
position
that's
inescapable
under
the
unified
analysis
of
the
speech
and
petition
clauses
received
by
this
court
already,
stating
that
while
the
petition
and
speech
clauses
are
separate
they
are
related
and
generally
subject
to
the
same
analysis.
application
of
that
same
analysis
is
all
that
we
ask,
that
malicious
lies
whispered
in
the
ear
of
a
government
official
receive
no
greater
protection
than
malicious
lies
printed
in
the
new
york
times.
counsel
for
the
petitioner
has
indicated
that
he
does
not
seek
protection
from
every
possible
sanction
that
might
result
from
information
contained
in
the
petition.
they
do,
however,
seek
protection,
absolute
immunity
from
the
only
sanction
available
to
mr.
smith.
mr.
smith
is
not
afforded
his
day
in
court
that
would
result
from
a
petition
to
the
judicial
branch.
the
only
opportunity
that
david
smith
will
ever
have
to
prove
the
truth
or
falsity
of
allegations
made
against
him
is
in
a
libel
action.
he's
properly
alleged
the
falsity,
he's
prepared
to
proceed
under
the
standard
providing,
we
would
say,
ample
and
we
believe
the
court
has
already
said
ample
protection
of
the
new
york
times
standard.
the
opportunity
to
respond
that
counsel
for
petitioner
discussed
existed
to
some
extent
under
the
facts
of
the
case
before
the
court.
it
did
not,
however,
exist
in
a
forum
that
resolution
of
the
conflicting
positions
and
facts
presented
would
ever
be
reached.
presumably,
had
mr.
smith
in
fact
been
appointed,
that
resolution
would
have
occurred
in
the
minds
of
the
public.
but
in
the
absence
of
his
appointment,
for
whatever
reason,
the
malicious
lies
are
left
and
he...
and
mr.
smith
has
no
opportunity
to
address
them.
the
petitioner's
argument,
it
seems
to
us,
asks
this
court
to
address
the
question
of
the
petition
clause
as
if
there
had
been
no
development
of
constitutional
libel
law
since
the
drafting
of
the
first
amendment.
he
appears
to
present
a
blank
slate,
or
a
blank
slate
for
the
last
200
years,
to
the
court.
but
we
would
submit
that
this
case
not
only
deals
with
the
petition
clause,
but
also
the
balancing
between
the
effect
of
immunities
granted
under
the
petition
clause
and
the
protections
granted
under
the
speech
clause,
because
it
is
as
citizens
see
those
protections
that
they
will
decide
where
discussion
of
matters
of
public
interest
will
take
place.
the
first
amendment
fundamentally
supports
the
proposition
of
public,
vigorous,
wide-open
debate
of
issues
important
to
the
public.
this
court
has
said
that
many
times,
and
as
recently
as
monday
of
this
week.
it
is
our
position
that
providing
one
who
would
use
malicious
lies
for
political
gain
with
an
absolute
immunity
would
not
only
encourage
the
false
information
flowing
to
the
federal
government,
but
would
encourage
the
discussion
of
it
to
be
moved
out
of
any
guarantee
of
rebuttal
by
those
not
only
who
were
defamed
by
it,
but
by
those
who
disagree
with
it.
the
discussion
of
the
matters
of
public
interest
would
be
moved
into
the
secrets
of
private
letters
and
whispered
petitions
to
government
officials,
carefully
chosen
so
that
they
are
the
person
most...
best
in
a
position
to
do
the
most
harm
to
the
man
who's
being
defamed.
that
approach
to
the
questions
presented
by
the
petitioner's
argument,
we
believe
necessarily
draws
one
back
to
the
protections
provided
by
new
york
times
and
the
fundamental
precepts
of
the
constitution
supporting
and
encouraging
open...
wide-open,
robust
debate
of
public
issues.
we
would
submit,
further,
that
while
the
petitioner
discusses
in
his
brief
at
some
length
the
chilling
effect
of
a
potential
large
libel
verdict,
that
since
new
york
times
there
has
not
been
a
single
libel
verdict
for
more
than
a
half
million
dollars
or
as
much
as
a
half
million
dollars
affirmed
by
an
appellate
court.
mr.
william
a.
eagles
in
alamass
county,
north
carolina
it
would
indeed,
sir.
i
point
that
out,
your
honor...
he
talks
about
the
unreasonable
inflation
of
libel
verdicts,
and
that
inflation...
before
new
york
time,
john
henry
faulk
was
awarded
over
half
a
million
dollars,
and
there
hasn't
been
an
award
that
large
since.
so
the
inflation
aspect
of
it
simply
doesn't
appear
from
the
record
of
those
verdicts
which
have
been
affirmed
by
appellate
courts.
he
discusses
the
cost
of
litigation.
the
cost
of
litigation
is
great.
and
it
in
fact
is
something
that
i
guess
we
all
should
consider
every
time
we
get
in
an
automobile
or
have
an
invitee
come
on
our
premises.
if
we
live
in
the
world,
we
risk
the
cost
of
litigation.
and
if
we
tell
malicious
lies
defaming
people,
we
ought
to
risk
that
cost
and
we
ought
to
risk
the
threat
of
large
libel
verdicts,
and
we
ought
to
be
chilled
from
malicious
lies
disrupting
the
decisionmaking
process
of
the
federal
government.
and
in
new
york
times,
the
chilling
prospect
was
considered,
it
was
weighed,
and
it
was
determined
that
under
the
speech
clause
and
the
press
clause,
that
question
was
adequately
addressed
by
the
malicious
falsehood
standard:
knowingly
false,
reckless
disregard
of
the
truth
or
falsity
thereof.
people
should
be
chilled
when
they're
about
to
tell
lies
about
people
that
will,
on
their
face,
do
those
people
harm
and
they
are
intended
to
do
harm
by
the
focus
to
the
recipient
that
the
speaker
chooses.
mr.
william
a.
eagles
that's
the
common
law
position
in
north
carolina.
it's
the
position
in
ponder
v.
cobb
which
was
cited
in
new
york
times,
and
which
the
north
carolina
general
libel
law
was
one
of
the
places
looked
to
by
this
court.
mr.
william
a.
eagles
as
i
understand
it,
your
honor,
that's
correct.
the
potential
for
a
public
figure
question
rests
in
the
trial
court,
i
suppose,
because
we
have,
for
the
purposes
of
the
motion
from
which
this
appeal
was
taken,
that
question
was
yielded.
it
has
not
been
yielded
for
the
litigation
generally,
but
except
for
that
question
that's
exactly
the
standard.
it's
a
standard
that
would
be
required
under...
by
new
york
times,
and
it's
a
standard
that
existed
in
north
carolina
for
just
this
type
of...
in
ponder
v.
cobb,
there
was
a
letter
to
a
state
official
complaining
of
local
election
officials.
so
it's
the
same
petitioning
aspect.
mr.
william
a.
eagles
well,
i
believe
so,
your
honor.
if
people
who
acted
in
good
faith
and
on
reasonable
grounds,
the
older
cases
discuss
bona
fide
and
probable
cause,
use
that
kind
of
language,
then
a
common
law
privilege
did
exist
and
should,
and
chilling
would
take
place
in
the
absence
of
it.
another
point
in
terms
of
the
cost
of
litigation
that
is
made
by
the
petitioner
in
his
brief
is
the
comparison
between
the
availability
of
counsel
and
the
cost
of
counsel
between
libel
plaintiffs
and
defendants,
pointing
out
that
a
contingent
fee
arrangement
is
often
available
to
libel
plaintiffs.
i
would
disagree.
i
would
think
it
is
seldom
available
to
libel
plaintiffs.
i
would
point
out
to
the
court
that
the
use
of
contingent
fee
arrangements
is
one
of
the
strongest
deterrents
to
litigation
with
no
substantial
basis
because
in
that
situation,
a
lawyer
who
is
making
a
decision
on
the
merits
of
potential
cases
as
presented
to
him
or
to
her
and
deciding...
before
the
case
is
ever
filed,
there
is
a
tremendous
weeding
out
process
that
takes
place.
and
that
is
a
protection
against
frivolous
litigation
that
is
substantial
and
grows
out
of
the
same
sorts
of
concerns
about
costs
of
litigation
that
the
counsel
for
petitioner
raises.
mr.
william
a.
eagles
i
think
it's
desirable
for
government
officials
who
are
acting
on
the
basis
of
some
information
to
the
benefit
or
detriment
of
a
particular
individual,
to
make
that
individual
aware
of
it
and
have
an
opportunity
to
respond
to
it
in
other
areas.
mr.
william
a.
eagles
i'm
sorry.
mr.
william
a.
eagles
yes,
your
honor,
i
think
it
is
in
fact
a
valuable...
can
potentially
be
a
valuable
service
for
someone
to
make
government
officials
aware
of
information
of
which
they
cannot
themselves
be
certain.
mr.
mcdonald,
however,
did
not
couch
his
defamation
in
those
sorts
of
terms.
rather,
he
presented
them
as
true
and
he,
as
the
briefs
point
out
and
it's
clear
from
the
letters,
cites
page
and
verse,
name,
address,
telephone
numbers
of
people
that
the
federal
official
was
told
could
substantiate
these
things.
and
those
people
are
the
very
witnesses
that
we
intend
to
call
at
trial,
are
the
people
through
whom
we
intend
to
prove
the
falsity
and
the
maliciousness.
but
the
fact
of
presenting
those
names
and
addresses
wins
this
air
that's
repeated
by
citation
to
those
in
petitioner's
brief
of
credibility
that
is
very
difficult
to
overcome
in
a
process
like
this
one,
where
any
number
of
candidates
for
an
office
exist,
any
number
of
whom
have
good
appropriate
qualifications,
and
as
to
one
of
whom
this
mess
is
presented,
this
series
of
allegations,
this
possible
problem.
and
the
effect
of
that
is
potentially
devastating
to
a
candidate
who
would
be
considered
equally
among
others,
and
could
do
away
with
any
possibility
or
any
perceived
need
for
checking
the
reliability
and
the
truth
or
falsity
by
the
federal
official
who
had
available
to
him
other
qualified
reasonable
candidates
to
choose
among.
the
potential
of
the
fbi
doing
an
investigation
that
counsel
for
petitioner
discussed
clearly
existed,
except
that
there
is
no
way
to
know
if
the
fbi
chose
to
or
not,
and
even
if
it
had,
the
allegations
of
that
process
would
not
necessarily
result
in
mr.
smith
having
an
opportunity
to
present
his
side
of
the
story.
in
fact,
that
argument,
it
seems
to
me,
raises
the
government's
investigatory
process
to
a...
it
puts
it
on
a
higher
plane
than
the
truth-seeking
processes
of
the
courts
in
which
mr.
smith
seeks
to
have
this
question
determined,
to
have
the
fact
of
the
falsity
of
the
information
and
the
malicious
nature
of
its
presentation
proven.
mr.
william
a.
eagles
that's
correct,
your
honor.
he
was
not
appointed.
mr.
william
a.
eagles
he's
in
private
practice
of
law
in
burlington,
north
carolina
in
the
community
where
some
copies
of
these
letters
were
found
among
the
general
population
and
in
the
community
where
word
of
the
existence
of
them
reached
him
from
rumor
in
the
streets
before
opportunity
had
been...
before
he
had
ever
seen
a
copy
of
it
and
the
other
ways
he
heard
about
it.
mr.
william
a.
eagles
well--
mr.
william
a.
eagles
--the
only
part
of
that
that's
in
the
record,
your
honor,
is
in
depositions
that
i
guess
have
not
yet
been
filed.
the
depositions
have
been
taken
and--
mr.
william
a.
eagles
--the
complaint
alleges
that
he
was
damaged
in
his
professional
reputation
in
the
community,
as
well
as
his
reputation--
mr.
william
a.
eagles
--that's
correct.
mr.
william
a.
eagles
oh,
yes.
they
knew
about
it
before
any
action
was
brought
on
mr.
smith's
behalf.
and
that
raises
another
question.
and
one
of
the...
the
webb
case
to
which
counsel
for
petitioner
made
some
comment...
in
that
case,
the
court
of
west
virginia
determined
that
the
petition
clause
provided
an
absolute
immunity
and
made
that
available
to
the
defendant,
even
though
he
published
a
newsletter
with
the
same
information
and
spread
it
generally
in
the
community.
and
that
is...
that
would
enable
someone
under
that
decision
to
avoid
any
possible
defamation
action
or
discussion
of
public
issues
and
criticism
of
public
figures,
public
officials,
by
simply
including
whatever
he
put
in
the
paper
or
to
the
public
generally,
including
it
also
in
a
petition
to
the
government.
and
that
would
be,
we
believe,
a
remarkable
way
around
the
longstanding
libel
laws
of
all
the
states
and
the
decision
of
new
york
times
and
this
court's
view
of
what
new
york
times
stands
for.
we
believe
that
an
individual's
right
to
protection
of
his
own
good
name
reflects
no
more
than
the
basic
concept
of
the
essential
dignity
and
worth
of
every
human
being,
and
that
that
concept
is
at
the
root
of
any
decent
system
of
ordered
liberty.
this
court
has
so
said
in
gertz,
and
we
believe
that
if
the
interest,
if
that
interest
is
important,
it
is
no
less
important
because
it
was
left
to
the
protection
of
the
state
and
that
it's
necessary
to
make
those
people
who
choose
to
lie
maliciously
about
people
and
defame
them,
to
be
held
to
answer
for
their
words.
and
if
there
are
no
further
questions
from
the
court,
we
would
urge
on
that
basis
for
the
court
to
affirm.
thank
you
very
much.
