justice
white
well,
you
wouldn't
say
that
it's
necessary
for
the
essential
function
of
government
to
operate
on
false
information.
justice
white
and
the
court
has
already
said
that,
too.
justice
white
yes.
justice
white
but
you
have
to
make
some
other
kind
of
an
argument.
you
have
to
make
an
argument
that
you
have
to
lie...
you
have
to
accept
some
lies
in
order
to
get
enough
of
the
truth.
justice
white
but
that
may
be
true
on
one
side
of
your
argument,
on
the
government
interest,
but
what
about
the
individual?
justice
white
does
he
have
to
be
able
knowingly
to
lie
in
order
to
give
decent
information
to
the
government?
knowingly
lie.
justice
white
well,
you
are.
you
say
absolutely
immunity.
it
doesn't
make
any
difference,
you
say,
whether
he's
lying
or
not.
justice
white
and
to
tell
lies
in
the
process.
justice
white
well,
what
about
on
those
occasions
when
he
knowingly
lies?
now,
what
possible
excuse...
what
basis
has
he
got
to
claim
absolute
immunity?
justice
white
alleged
to
be.
justice
white
alleged
to
be.
justice
white
because?
justice
white
of
course,
the
message
would
always
say
you
certainly
are
protected,
even
if
you
give
some
false
information
if
you
didn't
know
it
was
false.
but
the
message
might
say
if
you
deliberately
sent
in
false
information,
you'd
better
watch
your
ps
and
qs.
there
would
always
be
qualified
immunity,
wouldn't
there?
justice
white
well,
is
it?
is
it
or
not?
justice
white
what...
does
the
complaint
allege
any
specific
damage?
justice
white
so
that
alleges
that
there
has
been
damage
in
the
community.
justice
white
which
i
take
it
alleges
that
the
people
in
the
community
know
about
it.
