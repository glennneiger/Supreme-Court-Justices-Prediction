chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
will
hear
arguments
first
this
morning
in
cleveland
board
of
education
against
loudermill.
mr.
wyman,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
burger
how
long
after
his
appointment
was
that
discovery
made?
chief
justice
burger
doesn't
he
admit
that
he
is
the
same
person,
and
that
it
was
a
misdemeanor
and
not
a
felony?
chief
justice
burger
what
about
this
eye
examination?
is
it
your
position
that
when
this
man
was
offered
a
chance
to
have
a
second
eye
examination,
that
that
met
any
requirements
of
due
process?
chief
justice
burger
aren't
there
two
aspects
to
his
answer?
first,
the
objective,
uncontested
objective
fact
that
he
was
guilty
of
a
felony,
and
the
second
one
is
that
he,
as
he
claims,
misrepresented
this
because
of
a
misunderstanding.
now,
is
the
state
concerned
with
the
existence
of
a
felony
conviction,
or
concerned
that
he
got
confused
about
it?
which
is
the
basis
of
the
firing?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
fertel.
chief
justice
burger
did
you
make
the
point
that
bad
eyesight
is
not
important
for
a
mechanic,
but
only
for
a
driver?
chief
justice
burger
do
you
think
that
would
be
true
of
airplane
mechanics
as
well
as
automobile
mechanics?
chief
justice
burger
i
suppose
there
are
degrees
of
eye
defects,
too.
two
people
could
have
different
defects,
one
of
which
would
not
warrant
termination,
and
the
other
one
such
a
defect
that
it
would.
chief
justice
burger
does
ohio
have
a
statute
comparable
to
the
federal
statute
that
makes
it
a
crime
to
give
a
false
answer
in
an
application
for
employment?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
have
anything
further,
mr.
wyman?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
