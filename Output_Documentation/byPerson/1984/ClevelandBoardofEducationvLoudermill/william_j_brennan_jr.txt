justice
jr.
i
gather
his
service
was
satisfactory
during
the
eleven
months
before
discovery?
justice
jr.
how
long
had
he
been
working
before
his
discharge?
justice
jr.
and
his
service,
too,
had
been
satisfactory?
justice
jr.
would
you
state
that
again?
justice
jr.
then
you
said
but?
justice
jr.
but
nothing
in
that
letter
told
him
that
he
could
explain
or
respond
or
whatever?
justice
jr.
what
do
you
do,
mr.
wyman,
with
what
we
said
in
davis
and
scherer
last
time,
that
decisions
of
this
court
by
1978
had
required
some
kind
of
hearing
prior
to
discharge
of
an
employee
who
had
a
constitutionally
protected
property
interest
in
his
employment?
justice
jr.
but
he
didn't
get
any
kind
of
hearing.
