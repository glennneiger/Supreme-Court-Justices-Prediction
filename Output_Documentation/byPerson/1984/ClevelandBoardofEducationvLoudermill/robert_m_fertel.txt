mr.
robert
m.
fertel
thank
you.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
i
think
this
court's
recent
decision
in
davis
versus
scherer
makes
clear
that
the
issues
in
this
case
are
not
whether
some
pretermination
procedures
are
to
be
required
before
termination
of
a
discharged
employee,
but
what
procedures
are
to
be
required.
and
i
think
in
note
10
of
the
case
the
court
says
that
we
have
to
consider
the
factors
in
matthews
versus
eldridqe,
and
the
first
factor
in
matthews
versus
eldridge
is
the
private
interest
involved,
and
this
court
in
logan
versus
zimmerman
held
that
there
is
a
substantial
interest
in
the
continued
government
employment.
we
are
also
dealing
with
16
million
governmental
employees,
federal,
state,
and
local,
and
when
you
are
dealing
with
the
dependents
of
such
employees,
you
are
possibly
dealing
with
one-fifth
to
one-fourth
of
the
population
of
the
united
states,
so
the
right
to
continue
governmental
employment
is
clearly
a
substantial
interest.
the
second
factor
is
the
risk
of
wrongful
deprivation,
and
whether
the
use
of
additional
procedures
would
lessen
such
risk.
first
of
all,
under
ohio
law,
there
is
no
procedure
whatsoever
to
guarantee
pretermination
procedures.
it
is
like
a
knockout
punch.
you
get
a
letter
that
says
you
are
going
to
be
terminated,
and
you
have
to
get
up
off
your
feet
and
file
an
appeal
within
ten
days.
a
lot
of
times
you
are
without
counsel.
and
you
just
get
this
letter
and
they
say,
you
are
hereby
being
terminated.
in
the
loudermill
case,
he
received
the
letter
dated
november
3rd
saying
that
he
was
going
to
be
terminated.
then
the
board
of
education
on
november
13th
rubber
stamped
it,
confirmed
it.
but
all
the
letter
said
was,
you
are
here
being
terminated.
in
the
donnelly
case--
mr.
robert
m.
fertel
--twenty
days.
mr.
robert
m.
fertel
yes,
sir,
especially
in
the
fact
situation
where
there
is
no
pretermination
procedure.
all
of
a
sudden
you
just
get
a
letter.
there
are
no
warnings
without
any
pretermination
standard
to
be
considered.
one
day
you
get
a
letter.
mr.
robert
m.
fertel
well,
that
is
our
position,
that
you
need
some...
there
has
to
be
pretermination
procedures.
mr.
robert
m.
fertel
no,
your
honor.
it
is
just
the
effect
of
it,
to
show
how
the
system
lacks
due
process,
the
fact
that--
mr.
robert
m.
fertel
--right.
we
would
say
that
without
the
pretermination,
he
is
denied
due
process,
whether
it
is
ten
days
or
whatever.
mr.
robert
m.
fertel
it
isn't.
there
is
no...
the
point
being
that
i
am
just
saying
the
inadequacy
of
the
state
procedure
is
that
there
is
no
pretermination
procedures
whatsoever,
and
all
of
a
sudden
you
get
a
letter
for
termination,
and
then
you
have
to
react
in
ten
days
by
filing
an
appeal.
there
is
no
guarantee
in
ohio
of
either
a
pretermination
procedure
or
any
prompt
termination
procedure.
mr.
robert
m.
fertel
it
first
appeared
at
the
time
of
the
hearing,
before
the
referred
at
the
civil
service
commission,
where
he
testified
that
he
thought
he
was
convicted
of
a
misdemeanor,
and
when
he
saw
the
application,
it
said
were
you
ever--
mr.
robert
m.
fertel
--it
was
a
grand
theft
conviction
approximately
eleven
years
prior
to
the
filling
out
of
the
application,
and
there
are
administrative
code
sections
in
ohio
saying
that
more
than
two
years
is
insufficient.
you
can't...
somebody
can't
be
terminated
for
a
felony
conviction
prior...
for
two
years
prior
to
the
date
of
the
termination.
mr.
robert
m.
fertel
it
was
a
violation,
plus
the
fact
that
his
defense
was
that
he
thought
he
was
convicted
of
a
misdemeanor
and
not
a
felony.
mr.
robert
m.
fertel
well,
that
is
the
whole
issue
of
the
case.
it
is
whether
or
not
he
was
dishonest.
he
was
not
terminated
for
the
felony
conviction.
he
was
terminated
for
being
dishonest,
and
there
is
a
factual
question
whether
or
not
he
was
dishonest
at
the
hearing.
mr.
robert
m.
fertel
right,
but
then
you
have
to
have
an
opportunity
to
explain
the
reason
it
is
a
factual
conviction.
just
because
they
have
the
order
of
conviction,
there
is
still
a
fact
issue
in
this
case
whether
or
not
he
believed
that
he
was
convicted
of
a
felony
or
whether
he
thought
he
was
convicted
of
a
misdemeanor.
mr.
robert
m.
fertel
no.
first
of
all,
he
didn't
have
an
opportunity
for
two
and
a
half
months,
and
then
the
referee
didn't
file
his
report
for
another
two
and
a
half
months,
and
then
by
the
time
the
civil
service
commission
made
its
"hearing",
even
though
there
were
no...
it
was
just
arguments
of
counsel
in
july
for
nine
months
until
the...
by
the
time
he
got
his
letter
of
termination
until
his
actual
resolution,
and
that
is
one
of
the
issues
we
raise.
that
is
a
delay
issue,
that
there
wasn't
a
prompt
hearing,
that
you
are
entitled
to
a
prompt
hearing.
mr.
robert
m.
fertel
well,
i
think
first
of
all
you
have
to
have
a
hearing
in
front
of
the...
i
think
it
is
an
opportunity
to
respond
to
the
school
board.
i
think
not
only
is
there
a
question
of
whether
or
not
the
facts,
i
think
there
is
a
question
of
the
appropriate
sanctions,
and
i
think
it
could
have
made
the
opportunity--
mr.
robert
m.
fertel
--i
think
it
has
to
be
a
decision...
prior
to
termination,
he
has
to
have
a
hearing
in
front
of
an
impartial
decision-maker,
and
then
appeal,
because
i
think
you
have
different
standards
when
you
go
to
an
appeal,
because
first
of
all
the
decision
is
already
made.
there
is
a
different
standard.
you
have
to
show
abuse
of
discretion
before
maybe
the
civil
service
commission
will
change.
but
if,
let
us
say,
the
employer,
especially
with
the
fact
that
it
is
eleven
years
between
the
time
of
the
conviction
and
the
time
he
filed
his
application,
and
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
to
show
that
he
was--
mr.
robert
m.
fertel
--no,
i
say
the
school
board
would
have
to
make
the
initial
suspension.
mr.
robert
m.
fertel
well,
it
was
the
impartial
decision-maker,
because
it
should
be
made...
the
initial
termination
decision
should
be
made
by
an
impartial
decision-maker.
mr.
robert
m.
fertel
the
civil
service
is
an
impartial
decision-maker,
but
you
are
dealing
within
the
appeal,
right,
instead
of
the
initial
decision.
i
think
that
would
have
the
employer
then...
had
he
had
the
opportunity
to
respond
to
the
employer,
he
could
have
said,
well,
there
could
have
been
maybe
only
suspension
or
maybe
no
action
at
all,
saying
it
was
eleven
years
prior.
he
says
i
did
think
i
was
convicted
of
a
misdemeanor.
my
service
record
is
clean.
i
have
been
employed
for
eleven
months
and
nothing
has
happened.
you
know,
mr.
wyman
kept
saying
there
was
a
big
risk,
a
big
risk.
in
eleven
months,
there
was
no...
there
was
nothing,
no
incidents.
mr.
robert
m.
fertel
i
believe
he
was
sentenced
to
six
months
in
the
workhouse
and
fined.
mr.
robert
m.
fertel
i
believe
they
were
suspended.
i
don't
think
he
actually
served
them.
mr.
robert
m.
fertel
right.
also,
i
would
like
to
say
that
you
have
to
have
a
prompt,
full
hearing
prior
to
termination.
i
think
first
of
all
you
have
the
awesome
power
of
the
government
going
against
the
individual,
who
is
a
lot
of
times
not
represented
by
counsel.
i
think
the
procedure
now
in
ohio
where
you
file
an
appeal
and
have
a
hearing
and
go
through
the
courts,
you've
got
the
awesome
power
of
the
government,
who
has
all
their
attorneys,
against
the
individual.
you
have
an
employer
who
is
all
of
a
sudden...
who
has
geared
his
lifestyle
to
a
certain
income,
who
all
of
a
sudden
has
lost
wages.
we
are
not
just
dealing
with
monetary
damage.
we
are
dealing
with
emotional
damages.
mr.
robert
m.
fertel
in
mathews
versus
eldridge
it
was
a...
the
question
was
liability.
first
of
all,
the
issue
in
mathews
versus
eldridge
was
not
whether
a
hearing
was
required,
but
whether
a
prior
evidentiary
hearing
was
required.
there
was
no
issue
of
pretermination
procedures.
number
two,
in
mathews
versus
eldridge,
the
question
was...
basically
the
court
said
it
was
a
straightforward
medical
determination.
it
was
just
whether
or
not
the
person...
all
those...
it
was
by
a
medical
doctor's
medical
reports,
so
basically
it
was
a
straightforward
medical
determination.
in
this
it
was
dealing
with
a
fact
standing,
whether
or
not
there
were
certain
facts.
also,
in
donnelly's
case,
it
wasn't
just
a
medical
determination.
there
was
a
question
of
whether
or
not
a
prior
employee,
who
also
could
not
pass
the
eye
test,
was
still
employed,
and
that
was
a
defense
which
was
raised
in
front
of
the
civil
service
commission,
that
another
employee
who
also
could
not
pass
the
test,
that
plus
the
reasonableness,
because
he
was
a
bus
mechanic,
he
was
not
a
bus
driver,
and
the
reasonableness
of
why
a
bus
mechanic
would
have
to
pass
the
eye
test
was
also
raised,
so
those
were
the
two
issues.
also,
in
arnett
versus
kennedy,
they
talked
about...
i
think
the
hearings
was
three
months,
the...
proceedings
was
three
months,
but
i
think
in
the
fact
in
this
case
it
was
nine
months
before
the
termination
and
the
actual
notice,
and
i
think
you
have...
first
of
all,
you
have
a
question...
you
have
the
great
emotional
damage
to
the
employee.
he
is
without
wages.
loss
of
self-esteem.
in
these
cases,
you
go
with
the
awesome
power
of
the
government.
you
have
a
hearing
in
front
of
the
civil
service
commission.
you
take
ten
or
eleven
months
to
go
through
the
administrative
procedures,
and
you
have
to
file
it
through
the
courts.
it
could
be
another
two
or
three
years
with
the
courts.
and
then
you
also
have
problems
with
future
employees.
a
future
employer,
you
have
to
train
somebody,
you
have
to
train
another
employee.
mr.
robert
m.
fertel
well,
first
of
all,
you
can't
tell
whether
they
would
fire
somebody,
you
know.
it
is
after
the
fact.
had
they
come
up
to
mr.
loudermill
and
stated,
well,
you
were
convicted
eleven
months,
and
he
said,
well,
i
didn't
know,
plus,
the
only...
the
only
adjudicated--
mr.
robert
m.
fertel
--first
of
all,
he
was
convicted
of
dishonesty,
so
he
would
have
to
have
an
opportunity
to...
you
know,
it
is
just...
you
know,
it
is
after
the
fact.
first
of
all,
it
was
eleven...
the
conviction
was
eleven
years
previous.
there
was
nothing
on
his
record.
mr.
robert
m.
fertel
i
think
you
would
be
entitled
to
damages
for
denial
of
due
process.
first
of
all,
there
was
a
full
hearing
in
front
of
a
referee.
the
referee
determined
that
mr.
loudermill
was
credible,
and
recommended
that
he
be
reinstated
without
back
pay.
the
civil
service
commission
never
held
a
hearing.
it
just
made
a
determination
without
holding
a
hearing,
so
the
only
really
adjudicated
facts
you
have
in
this
case
was
that
mr.
loudermill
was
credible,
and
that
he
was...
that
he
honestly
believed
that
he
was
convicted
of
a
misdemeanor.
so,
on
the
record
of
this
case,
the
only
determination
made
after
a
full
factual
hearing
was
by
the
referee,
who
stated
that
he
believed
that
mr.
loudermill
was
sincere
in
knowing
that
he
was
convicted
of
a
misdemeanor
instead
of
a
felony.
mr.
robert
m.
fertel
yes,
your
honor,
i
raised
that
issue
in
front
of
the
civil
service
commission.
mr.
robert
m.
fertel
the
rationale
they
gave
was
that
sometimes
there
is
bad
weather
and
they
need
substitute
drivers,
and
therefore
they
should
have...
that
sometimes
they
supposedly
would
have
bus
mechanics
drive
buses,
and
so
i
made
the
point
number
one,
i
thought
if
you
are
going
to
terminate
everybody
who
can't
pass
an
eye
test,
if
you
terminate
somebody,
you
have
to
terminate
everybody.
you
can't
single
out
between
one
employee
and
another.
so,
the
fact
that
one
employee
who...
another
employee
who
also
can't
pass
an
eye
exam
was
not
terminated,
i
thought
that
was
a
defense,
plus
the
fact
that
i
think
they
could
hire
substitute
bus
drivers
instead
of
having
the
bus
mechanics.
i
thought
it
was
very
unreasonable
to
also
require
the
bus
mechanic
to
also
be
a
bus
driver.
he
was
hired
to
be
a
bus
mechanic
and
not
to
be
a
bus
driver,
so
i
argued
basically
the
fact
that,
number
one,
another
employee
who
could
not
pass
an
eye
exam
was
not
terminated,
and
number
two,
that
it
was
unreasonable
to
have
bus
mechanics
be
substitute
bus
drivers.
mr.
robert
m.
fertel
well,
obviously--
mr.
robert
m.
fertel
--the
only
defect
was
that
he
couldn't
pass
the
state
requirements
for
a
bus
driver.
that
is
why
he
was
terminated.
and
because
when
they
needed
substitute
bus
drivers
they
could
not
use
him
as
a
substitute
bus
driver.
his
work
as
a
bus
mechanic
has
never
been
questioned.
i
would
also
like...
as
far
as
the
delay
issue,
we
are
dealing
here
with
nine
months.
during
the
nine
months
he
said
there
was
no
right
to
unemployment,
there
was
no
right
to
welfare
unless
he
sells
his
assets,
like
his
house
and
his
car,
which,
you
know,
if
you
are
dealing
with
somebody
who
has
geared
his
lifestyle
to
a
certain
level
and
all
of
a
sudden
gets
a
notice
saying
he
is
being
terminated,
you
have
a
long,
drawn
out
proceeding
where
the
person
not
only
loses
wages,
might
not
be
able
to
get
welfare,
has
to
sell
his
house,
has
to
probably
sell
his
car,
will
probably
lose
his
marriage
and
his
children,
basically
the
decisions
of
this
court
say
that
a
person
should
be
given
a
full
and
fair
hearing
prior
to
final
deprivation.
in
this
case
mr.
wyman
says,
well,
it
is
temporary
deprivation,
ten
or
eleven
months,
if
he
is
proven
lawful,
you
get
your
back
wages,
but
during
those
ten
or
eleven
months,
the
person
probably
loses
his
house,
he
probably
loses
his
car,
his
family,
he
loses
his
self-esteem,
plus
the
right
of
the
government,
which
is
the
third
factor
in
mathews
versus
eldridge.
they
have
to
decide
when...
they
have
to
train
somebody
else.
what
happens
if
the
government
says
the
termination
is
proved
lawful?
then
they
have
already
somebody
hired
who
may
reach
tenured
status
and
this
employee,
so
it
is
not
just
an
issue
of
back
pay.
the
final
deprivation
when
a
person
loses
his
house,
loses
his
car,
loses
all
his
assets,
and
probably
loses
his
family,
is
already
taken
prior
to
the
administrative
procedure
being
over,
and
this
court
has
said
that
the
purposes
of
the
due
process
is
before
final
deprivation,
so
back
pay,
a
person
has
to
give
up
his
house,
has
to
give
up
his
car,
probably
loses
his
family,
loses
his
self-esteem,
plus
he
is
in
limbo.
he
doesn't
know
whether
or
not
he
should
try
to
get
other
employment,
and
also
the
reasons
for
his
termination,
like
in
donnelly's,
or,
excuse
me,
loudermill,
he
was
terminated
for
dishonesty.
every
time
he
filed
another
application,
what
is
your
last
employment,
cleveland
board
of
education,
was
terminated
for
dishonesty.
so
how
do
you
expect
somebody
to
get
another
job?
and
so
here
you
are
dealing
with
a
lengthy
period
where
actually
the
effects,
the
deprivation
is
final.
he
loses
his
house,
he
loses
his
family.
there
is
definitely
final
deprivation
before
you
get...
prior
to
resolution.
so
it
is
not
just
a
temporary
termination
and
back
wages.
i
think
there
is
very
emotional...
i
think
it
is
not
just
monetary
damages,
but
the
emotional--
mr.
robert
m.
fertel
--he
was
already
divorced,
but
he
lost
his
house.
he
had
to
stay
in
his
sister's
house.
he
was,
obviously,
his
daughter...
he
couldn't
support
his
daughter,
so
he
lost--
mr.
robert
m.
fertel
--i
am
talking
to
all
employees.
mr.
robert
m.
fertel
i
don't
know
if
there
are
statistics.
i
think
that
is...
i
think
in
the
briefs
we
stated
about
the
emotional
damage,
and
i
think
that
a
lot
of
people,
when
there
is
loss
of
income,
all
of
a
sudden
a
person
in
fact
who
may
be
a
fairly
well
paid
employer
all
of
a
sudden
gets
a
letter
saying,
you
are
being
terminated.
mr.
robert
m.
fertel
well,
not
then,
but
when
it
drags
on
and
drags
on
and
drags
on.
mr.
robert
m.
fertel
well,
arnett
versus
kennedy
did
not,
but
this
case
is
different,
because
in
that
case
there
is
a
question
about
proper
service,
and
in
arnett
versus
kennedy
he
made
libelous
statements,
and
there
was
a
question
whether
or
not
there
was
a
danger
to
employees
or
to
morale,
the
other
employees.
in
this
case,
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
shooing
that
there
was
any
lack
of
service,
good
service
by
either
mr.
donnelly
or
mr.
loudermill.
there
was
no
danger
to
the
work
force
by
having--
mr.
robert
m.
fertel
--well,
i
think
the
court
in
davis
versus
scherer
said
there
has
to
be...
you
have
to
consider
the
three
factors
in
mathews
versus
eldridge.
mr.
robert
m.
fertel
well,
i
think--
mr.
robert
m.
fertel
--well,
i
think
that's
what
i
said.
i
think
when
we
consider
the
factors
in
mathews
versus
eldridge,
under
the
facts
of
this
case
a
full
evidentiary
hearing
is
required.
mr.
robert
m.
fertel
right,
that
is
the
position
that--
mr.
robert
m.
fertel
--no,
but
i
think
you
need
clarity
in
this
case.
i
think
here
you
are
dealing
with
16
million
employees.
like
in
miranda
warnings,
when
an
alleged
criminal
is
arrested,
you
said
you
have
to
give
him
warning,
so
i
think
that
is
clarity.
i
think
we
need
clarity
so
that
every
civil
service
employee,
federal,
state,
or
local,
and
every
government
knows
exactly
what
procedures
have
to
be
employed.
and
i
think
by
considering
the
factors,
i
think...
first
of
all
i
think
the
government's
interest
also
would
be
furthered
in
having
a
full
evidentiary
hearing,
first
of
all
because
there
is
no
two-tier
procedure
where
they
have
to
have
one
hearing
at
an
administrative
level,
and
another
hearing
where
you
go
to
two
hearings,
plus
the
fact
that
if
there
is
a
decision
to
be
made,
that
the
employer...
at
least
there
could
be
finality.
the
employer
could
make
a
determination,
this
employer
is
going
to
be
discharged.
then
we
could
hire
somebody
else.
there
is
no
position
where
they
have
to
hire
somebody
else
and
go
through,
pay
for
training
while
this,
while
the
appeals
process,
and
then
when
the
appeals
process
is
done
and
determines
that
he
has
to
be
rehired
and
you
have
two
people
for
the
same
position,
plus
the
fact
that
he
said
there
may
be
excessive
back
pay.
the
longer
the
procedure
takes,
the
longer
back
pay.
so,
especially
if
you
get
a
court
judgment,
then
you
have
interest.
mr.
robert
m.
fertel
right,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
m.
fertel
that
is
my
position.
mr.
robert
m.
fertel
that
was
the
basis
of
the
plurality
decision
in
arnett
versus
kennedy,
that
the
state
procedures
are
bound
with
the
procedural...
or
the
property
interest
is
bound
up
with
certain
procedures,
and
the
employer
is
bound
by
those
procedures.
you
have
to
take
the
bitter
with
the
sweet,
and
i
think
the
majority
of
this
court--
mr.
robert
m.
fertel
--i
think
you
have
a
right
to
a
prompt
post-termination
hearing,
if
there
is
a
promptness.
i
think
you
have
to...
if
this
court
doesn't...
if
there
is
not
a
full
evidentiary
hearing,
there
has
to
be
at
least
some
pretermination
procedures
with
the
full
evidentiary
hearing
promptly.
it
is
our
position
that
a
full
evidentiary
hearing
is
required
but
if
the
court
takes
the
position
that
a
full
evidentiary
hearing
is
not
required,
there
at
least
has
to
be
a
pretermination
procedure
to
respond--
mr.
robert
m.
fertel
--right,
and
then
a
prompt--
mr.
robert
m.
fertel
--i
think
it
has
to
be
given
in
the
statute.
otherwise
there
is
no
guarantee.
mr.
robert
m.
fertel
no,
your
honor.
i
think
in
vitek
versus
jones,
santowski
versus
kramer,
and
lobin
versus
zimmerman,
the
court
has
specifically
rejected
that
principle.
mr.
robert
m.
fertel
and
arnett,
too.
mr.
robert
m.
fertel
right,
the
courts
say
that...
those
cases
held
that
the
majority
court
has
never
accepted
the
bitter
with
the
sweet.
mr.
robert
m.
fertel
i
don't
believe
there
is
a
specific
statute.
of
course,
the
whole
point
being
there
is
a
question
of
whether
or
not
it
was
actually
a
felony
or
a
false
answer.
also,
i
think
there
is
a
big
point
here
about
the
promptness.
i
think
that
the
court
of
appeals
stated
that
mr.
loudermill
had
a
hearing
two
and
a
half
months.
however,
the
decision
was
not
made
until
nine
months.
and
i
think
you
can't
just
say
give
a
hearing
and
then
allow
an
unreasonable
time
for
resolution.
this
court
has
stated
you
are
not
only
entitled
to
a
prompt
hearing,
but
you
are
also
entitled
to
a
prompt
disposition,
and
i
think
just
the
fact
that
a
person
was
given
a
hearing
in
two
and
a
half
months
when
the
whole
procedure
took
ten
months,
i
think,
is
very
unreasonable.
also,
the
court
of
appeals
mentioned
the
procedure
used
of
mandamus.
i
think
that
is
a
very
extraordinary
remedy.
it
is
discretionary
whether
or
not
the
court
would
grant
it.
you
don't
know
how
many
months
it
would
be,
especially
when
you
are
dealing
with
somebody
who
doesn't
have
counsel.
you
are
dealing
with
the
government
on
one
hand,
the
awesome
power
of
the
government
against
the
individual,
who
a
lot
of
time
isn't
represented
by
counsel.
also,
this
court
in
mennonite
board
of
missions
versus
adams
stated
that
the
fact
that
an
individual
can
protect
his
rights
still
doesn't
relieve
the
government
of
its
responsibility
to
guarantee
due
process
rights.
also,
the
sixth
circuit
held
that
there
was
no
liberty
interest
violated
because
the
grounds
for
mr.
loudermill's
and
donnelly's
terminations
weren't
published,
and
it
is
our
position
with
the
court
that
it
was
communicated
to
the
employers,
that
when
mr.
loudermill
filed
employment
applications
prior
to...
this
is
his
past
employer,
cleveland
board
of
education,
they
said,
well,
he
was
terminated
for
dishonesty,
and
was
unable
to
get
any
future
employment.
so
there
was
communication.
this
court
in
paul
versus
davis
stated
that
the
constitutional
violation
is
defamation
in...
deprivation
of
a
governmental
interest.
here
he
was
terminated.
he
had
a
right
to
continued
employment.
therefore
he
had
a
governmental
interest,
and
he
was
terminated
in
there,
so
that
the
procedures,
constitutional
requirements
would
be
provided
by
the
publication.
it
doesn't
have
to
be
"publicized",
but
there
was
publication
because
other
employees,
employers,
or
potential
employers
were
notified.
i
would
like
to
say
that
in
gaus
versus
lopez,
where
there
was
suspension
of
high
school
students,
they
said
that
there
would
be
a
liberty
interest,
because
future
employment
opportunities
would
be
involved,
and
in
their
case
it
wasn't
"published",
but
yet
this
court
found
a
violation
of
a
liberty
interest.
i
would
like
to
point
out
to
this
court
in
parrott
versus
taylor
you
said
that
there
are
only
two
instances
where
no
pretermination
procedures
would
be
provided.
one
is
where
there
is
implausibility
of
pretermination
procedures,
which
is
certainly
not
the
case.
and
number
two,
where
there
is
necessity
for
quick
action,
and
i
think
if
there
is
an
emergency
situation,
which
we
deny,
because
there
was
no
prior
violations
or
disciplinary
procedures,
that
a
suspension
could
be
made
with
the
opportunity
to
respond
to
the
charges.
so
therefore
the
two
requirements
in
parrott
versus
taylor
to
dispose
of
any
pretermination
procedures
will
not
be
applicable
herein.
the
main
thing
that
we
need...
basically
is
that
we
need
clarity,
that
there
has
to
be
some...
that
public
employers
have
to
know
what
exactly
the
procedures
are
before
they
can
terminate
somebody.
as
you
know,
the
police
know
that
they
have
to
have
probable
cause.
they
have
to
know
that
they
give
the
miranda
warnings.
and
so
we
need
clarity.
i
would
also
like
to
say
that
you
can't
really
have
due
process
on
a
case
by
case
basis.
mr.
wyman
says,
well,
the
greater
the
risk,
the
more
the
need
for
pretermination
procedures.
you
leave
it
up
to
the
employer
to
determine
whether
or
not
there
are
risks
involved.
there
is
no
statutory
right
to
grant
pretermination
procedures.
well,
this
case
there
is
a
big
risk
so
we
have
hearings.
this
case
we
won't.
i
think
you
need
a
statutory
right
that
says
you
are
going
to
give
them
notice,
you
are
going
to
give
them
an
opportunity
to
present
witnesses,
and
have
a
decision
by
an
impartial
decision-maker,
and
also
that
you
need
a
prompt
procedure,
it
has
to
be
held
within
30
days,
so
not
only
the
government
can
make
its
determination
of
whether
or
not
they
are
going
to
have
to
hire
somebody,
but
also
the
employer
can
get
on
with
the
rest
of
his
life.
thank
you.
