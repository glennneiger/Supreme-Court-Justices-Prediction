mr.
james
g.
wyman
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
the
issue
presented
by
the
cases
at
bar
today
is
whether
or
not
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
required
the
cleveland
board
of
education
and
the
parma
board
of
education
to
grant
respondents
a
hearing
before
they
were
terminated
from
their
employment.
it
is
the
petitioners'
position
that
the
precedents
of
this
court
do
not
require
a
pretermination
hearing,
and
further,
that
the
ohio
revised
code,
section
124.34,
comports
with
the
due
process
clause
and
adequately
protected
the
respondents'
rights.
mr.
loudermill
was
a
security
guard
for
the
cleveland
board
of
education.
in
order
to
get
that
job,
he
filled
out
an
application
form.
on
that
form,
he
was
asked
if
he
had
ever
been
found
guilty
of
any
felony.
he
answered
he
had
not.
he
further
attested
at
the
end
of
that
application
that
the
answers
he
gave
were
not
only
truthful
but
accurate.
a
routine
check
of
his
record
was
done
by
the
cleveland
board
of
education.
he
was
found
to
have
had
a
previous
felony
conviction,
that
of
grand
larceny,
and
he
was
terminated.
mr.
james
g.
wyman
after
his
appointment
it
was
approximately
eleven
months,
your
honor.
what
had
happened
in
that
case
is,
we
had
originally
hired
on
a
number
of
security
people
during
the
institution
of
our
desegregation
case.
we
thereafter
reorganized
our
organization
and
as
a
part
of
the
reorganization
we
went
through
routine
checks
for
a
newly
created
safety
and
security
department.
mr.
james
g.
wyman
there
were
no
known
reasons
or
any
incidents
that
had
happened
with
mr.
loudermill.
that
is
correct.
but
the
cleveland
board
of
education,
upon
finding
out
of
his
criminal
past,
did
in
fact
release
him.
mr.
donnelly
was
a
mechanic
for
the
parma
board
of
education.
he
was
required
as
a
part
of
that
job
to
have
an
annual
eye
examination.
he
took
and
failed
that
eye
examination.
he
was
given
the
opportunity
to
retake
that
exam.
he
declined
to
do
so,
and
he,
too,
was
fired.
the
most
recent
decisions--
mr.
james
g.
wyman
--i
am
not
sure
of
the
actual
length
of
employment.
he
had
been
working
for
not
a
considerable
length
of
time,
but
more
than
two
or
three
years
he
had
been
employed.
mr.
james
g.
wyman
as
far
as
i
know,
yes,
that
is
true.
the
most
recent
decisions
of
this
court
have
consistently
held
that
in
analyzing
the
requirements
of
due
process
vis-a-vis
the
termination
of
an
employee
who
has
a
protected
property
interest,
the
court
will
take
a
case-by-case
approach
based
upon
the
facts
of
each
case,
and
further,
that
the
timing
and
the
nature
of
the
required
due
process
hearing
depend
upon
an
appropriate
accommodation
of
competing
interests.
those
interests
include
the
private
interest
of
the
employee.
they
include
the
timing
or
the
length
of
deprivation,
the
risk
of
error
that
is
involved,
and
the
governmental
entity's
interest.
it
is
petitioners'
argument
that
in
weighing
and
in
balancing
these
particular
factors,
the
court
should
determine
that
the
governmental
interest
outweighs
that
of
the
individual
employees
in
this
case.
the
private
interest
of
the
individual
in
this
case
would
be
his
right
to
continued
employment
and
the
possible
interruption
of
his
income.
the
length
of
loss
in
these
cases
turns
out
to
be
exactly
ten
months.
throughout
the
administrative
procedure,
it
took
ten
months
for
a
resolution
of
the
status
as
to
whether
or
not
they
had
been
rightfully
or
wrongfully
terminated--
mr.
james
g.
wyman
--oh,
absolutely,
your
honor.
mr.
james
g.
wyman
that's
correct.
and
at
the
end
of
that
ten-month
period,
the
administrative
agency
determined
that
he
had...
mr.
loudermill
had
in
fact
been
dishonest,
and
there
was
no
appeal
taken
from
that
decision,
so
as
it
stands,
and
as
of
the
time
of
the
filing
of
the
complaint
in
this
case,
mr.
loudermill
had
been
adjudicated
to
have
been
dishonest.
mr.
james
g.
wyman
that's
correct.
mr.
donnelly
was...
his
decision
was
modified
by
the
parma
civil
service
commission
to
a
suspension
for
the
time
of
period...
length
of
time
that
he
was
off,
and
he
was
reinstated,
however,
to
his
employment,
so
he
did
get
his
job
back.
mr.
james
g.
wyman
absolutely.
under
ohio
revised
code
124.34
they
have
the
right
to
a
full,
prompt
de
novo
hearing
where
they
are
entitled
to--
mr.
james
g.
wyman
--they
are
entitled
to
reinstatement,
and
if
the
discharge
was
found
to
be
wrong,
reinstatement
and
back
pay.
the
civil
service
commissions,
however,
also
have
the
right
to
affirm
whatever
decision
the
governmental
entity
made,
or
it
can
modify.
the
modification
may
take
the
form
of
denying
back
wages,
or
it
may
take
the
form
of
modifying
the
length
of
time
of
any
suspension
that
might
be
involved.
mr.
james
g.
wyman
there
is
no
statutorily
provided
scheme
for
response.
in
both
cases
there
was
a
time
period
within
which
a
response
could
have
been
granted.
mr.
james
g.
wyman
there
is
no
statutorily
outlined
scheme
for
requiring
or
allowing
some
pretermination
process.
mr.
james
g.
wyman
but
the
facts
in
the
instant
case
reflect
that
there
was
a
time
period
during
which
both
mr.
donnelly
or
mr.
loudermill
may
have
responded
should
they
have
desired
to
do
so.
mr.
james
g.
wyman
there
was
a
letter
sent
out
in
the
loudermill
case
to
the
employee,
and
his
discharge
was
not
confirmed
by
the
board
of
education
until
november
13th,
ten
days
later.
mr.
james
g.
wyman
that's
correct,
and
it's
the
position
of
the
petitioners
that
there
would
have
been
no
purpose
to
any
additional
pretermination
hearing
or
process.
the
factual
basis
upon
which
the
boards
of
education
made
their
determination
was
objective
criteria.
in
mr.
loudermill's
case,
we
had
two
documents
in
front
of
us.
we
had
a
court
record
which
reflected
his
felony
conviction,
and
we
had
his
application,
which
reflected
his
attestation
to
not
only
the
honesty
but
the
accuracy
of
the
information.
mr.
james
g.
wyman
it
is
the
petitioners'
position
that--
mr.
james
g.
wyman
--he
got
no
kind
of
hearing,
and
for
the
sake
of
the
argument
before
this
court,
because
of
the
status
of
the
pleadings,
the
way
this
case
has
developed
up,
that
has
to
be
taken
as
true.
it
is
our
position
that
there
must
be...
a
fair
reading
of
the
cases
indicates
there
must
be
a
hearing
provided
before
an
employee
is
finally
deprived
of
his
rights.
and
in
this
case
mr.
donnelly
was
never
finally
deprived
of
his
right
to
employment,
because
in
fact
he
was
reinstated,
and
in
mr.
loudermill's
case
he
was
finally
deprived
at
the
end
of
the
posthearing
process.
mr.
james
g.
wyman
there
are
cases
that
do
in
fact
indicate
that
there
should
be
an
opportunity
to
respond.
it
is
our
position
that
in
this
case,
or
under
the
facts
of
this
case,
the
response
would
have
served
no
purpose,
and
i
would
turn
to
basically
the
dixon
versus
love
type
of
analogy
where
the
only
thing
that
they
could
have
said
was,
i
didn't
mean
to
do
it,
or
i
didn't
know
that
it
was
a
felony.
there
was
no
additional--
mr.
james
g.
wyman
--he
could
say
that.
mr.
james
g.
wyman
we
believe
that
the
reliability
of
the
objective
evidence
was
such
that
we
had
a
right--
mr.
james
g.
wyman
--we
had
a
court
record
of
the
conviction
and
his
application.
mr.
james
g.
wyman
because
we
have
an
employee
number.
we
have
a
number
of
internal
processes
that
would
identify
who
we
had.
mr.
james
g.
wyman
we
have
an
employee
number.
we
have
a
social
security
number
which
identifies
the
employee,
which
also
would
be
on
his...
it
would
be
on
his
application
form,
obviously,
and
we
would
have
identified
the
person
that
was
involved
with
the
name
and
also
checked
it
out
to
make
sure
that
it
was
in
fact
the
person
we
were
talking
about.
we
would
not
act
arbitrarily.
when
we
terminate
someone,
we
do
not
just
terminate
them
at
a
whim.
we
make
sure
there
is
a
reason.
mr.
james
g.
wyman
i
cannot
honestly
answer
that,
your
honor.
mr.
james
g.
wyman
under
the
facts
of
this
case,
certainly.
it
is
in
fact
admitted
that
mr.
loudermill
was
the
person
who
was
convicted
of
the
grand
theft
felony
previously,
but
again,
the
important
thing,
i
think,
for
this
court
to
realize
is
that
we
are
talking
about
the
boards'
use,
both
parma
and
cleveland
boards'
use
of
objective
criteria.
we
are
not
using
subjective
criteria,
where
the
possibility
is
that
we
might
have
made
some
sort
of
error,
even
though
again
i
admit
that
certainly
even
with
objective
criteria
there
may
be
an
error
somewhere
in
that
process.
mr.
james
g.
wyman
that's
correct.
mr.
james
g.
wyman
i
don't
know
what
the
basis
of
the
civil
service
commission's
decision
was,
because
the
parma
civil
service
commission
is
not
a
party
in
any
of
the
cases
before
the
court.
i
do
understand,
though,
that
it
may
have
been
a
compromise
type
of
position
where
they
gave
him
back
his
job
but
also
failed
to
grant
him
the
back
pay
as
a
half
a
loaf
type
of
situation.
mr.
james
g.
wyman
apparently
he
accepted
that,
although
he
has...
he
went
through
a
process,
a
court
process
to
try
to
win
back
his
back
pay.
mr.
james
g.
wyman
donnelly
is,
yes,
but
the
post-termination
delay
issue
which
is
involved
in
loudermill
is
not
involved
in,
i
don't
believe,
the
parma
case.
mr.
james
g.
wyman
it
is
the
parma
board
of
education's
position
that
they
did
give
him
that
opportunity.
they
gave
him
a
chance
to
retake
the
eye
examination,
and
said,
here,
take
it
again.
before
we
do
anything
take
the
exam
again.
maybe
there
was
an
erroneous
medical
determination.
maybe
there
is
something
else
that
can
happen.
mr.
james
g.
wyman
there
was
at
least
a
communication
to
him
and
an
apparent
refusal
to
take
that
second
eye
examination.
what
mr.
donnelly's
thinking
was
as
to
why--
mr.
james
g.
wyman
--i
can't
answer
that,
because
i
don't
know
what
went
on
in
the
minds
of
those
in
the
civil
service,
other
than
the
fact
that--
mr.
james
g.
wyman
--okay.
mr.
james
g.
wyman
you
are
placing
me
in
your
position.
my
thought
would
be
that
the
greater
the
risk
of
error,
obviously,
the
more
useful
the
pretermination
process.
mr.
james
g.
wyman
it
would
be
our
position
from
the
board
of
educations--
mr.
james
g.
wyman
--that
we
would
like
you
to,
yes.
we
realize,
obviously,
that
there
are
some
constraints
to
that,
and
with
the
definition
of
due
process.
another
important
point
is
that
the
cases
of
this
court
that
have
come
down
that
dealt
with
pretermination
hearings
dealt
also
with
situations
where
there
was
a
permanency
of
the
effect
of
the
discharge
or
the
effect
of
the
taking
of
a
property
right.
we
do
not
have
that
type
of
permanency
in
this
case.
when
we
are
talking
about
the
deprivation
here,
we
are
talking
about,
assuming
we
are
wrong,
which
we
do
not
concede,
obviously,
we
are
talking
about
the
fact
that
it
is
a
temporary
loss
of
employment,
a
temporary
loss
of
wages
which,
if
we
are
found
to
have
been
wrong,
he
may
be
reinstated,
and
he
may
be
entitled
to
his
back
pay.
he
can
be
made
whole
entirely.
the
other
cases
of
this
court
which
dealt
with
and,
of
course,
which
there
is
a
valid
and
obvious
concern,
is
when
you
have
a
deprivation
such
as
the
taking
of
someone's
benefits
that
might
in
fact
leave
them
poverty
stricken
and
they
would
be
unable
to
survive.
we
are
not
talking
about
that
type
of
situation.
mr.
james
g.
wyman
we...
the
parma
board
of
education
would
certainly
argue
that,
yes.
and
those
facts,
i
believe,
are
in
the
record,
in
the
pleadings
in
the
complaint.
mr.
james
g.
wyman
yes,
sir?
mr.
james
g.
wyman
it
was
before,
your
honor.
their
offer
was
made
before
he
was
discharged
to
take
a
second
eye
examination.
he
refused
to
do
so,
and
he
was
thereafter
discharged.
mr.
james
g.
wyman
i
believe
so.
i
believe
it
is.
it
is
a
benefit
that
the
parma
board
of
education...
it
is
not
only
a
benefit,
but
it
is
a
safety
factor
that
is
involved
with
the
boards
of
education,
and
they
provide
those
examinations
for
their
employees.
mr.
james
g.
wyman
yes.
mr.
james
g.
wyman
yes.
mr.
james
g.
wyman
it
is
clear
that
he
knew
that
flunking
the
eye
exam
would
cause
his
discharge.
the
other
gentleman,
it
was
part
of
a
labor
negotiation,
and
had
a
grandfather
status,
and
has
not
in
fact
doing
mechanical
type
chores
as
mr.
donnelly
was
performing.
mr.
donnelly's
position
directly
related...
it
is
our
position
that
his
position
directly
related
to
the
safety
of
the
children
involved.
we
are
talking
about
both
mr.
loudermill
and
mr.
donnelly
dealing
in
very
sensitive
areas.
we
have
mr.
loudermill
being
a
security
guard,
and
charged
in
the
cleveland
board
of
education
with
millions
of
dollars
worth
of
real
estate,
and
also
millions
of
dollars
worth
of
assets,
computers,
educational
materials,
and
to
find
that
we
have
a
person
who
is
an
ex-felon
as
our
security
guard
is
very
distressful
to
us.
we
need,
and
i
believe
this
court
should
find,
the
right
to
immediately
discharge
an
employee
who,
pursuant
to
some
objective
criteria,
in
this
case
again
a
court
order,
is
found
to
have...
to
pose
a
risk,
a
potential
threat
to
the
system.
we
have
to
be
able
to
immediately
act
on
that.
it
affects
not
only
the
efficiency
of
our
operation
and
the
discipline
of
our
employees,
as
the
sixth
circuit
said,
but
with
boards
of
education
it
affects
the
safety--
mr.
james
g.
wyman
--an
immediate
suspension
itself
would
kick
in
the
same
thing.
it
becomes
a
semantic
game.
whether
you
call
it
a
suspension
pending
termination
or
whether
you
call
it
termination,
under
the
ohio
revised
code
the
same
due
process
rights
are
afforded,
and
i
believe
under
the
dictates
of
this
court
the
same
due
process
rights
would
be
required.
the
question
would
be
whether
or
not
there
should
be
a
pretermination
before
the
suspension.
mr.
james
g.
wyman
i
would
think
that
that
would
be
a
possible
resolution,
although
it
may
in
fact
still
be
burdensome
upon
the
employer,
the
boards
of
education.
mr.
james
g.
wyman
that's
correct.
that's
our
position.
i
mean,
technically
we
could
have
suspended
him
without
pay,
given
him
the
hearings
that
are
required
under
ohio
revised
code
124.34,
and
called
them
pretermination
hearings.
and
by
playing
that
type
of
game
we
could
have
avoided
a
pretermination
hearing
issue.
mr.
james
g.
wyman
did
the
court
of
appeals...
we
are
unsure.
i
am
unsure.
mr.
james
g.
wyman
the
court
was
unaware
of
what
it
could
do.
i
mean,
we
were...
when
we
went
back
to
district
court--
mr.
james
g.
wyman
--that's
correct,
and
that
was
the
only
issue
left,
and
the
question
would
have
been--
mr.
james
g.
wyman
--probably.
the
time
length
in
this
case
would
have
been
a
short
time
period,
and
again,
substantively
his
employment
has
been
properly
terminated,
the
collateral
estoppel
argument
in
regards
to
a
substantive
issue
of
employment.
mr.
james
g.
wyman
we
are
concerned
that
he
got
confused
about
it.
i
think
that
that
adds
a
little
bit
of
fuel
to
the
fire.
while
the
felony
itself
might
raise
some
concerns,
to
find
that
he
had
misrepresented
that,
the
felony
was
relatively
old,
but
the
misrepresentation
was
relatively
new.
and
if
we
are
dealing
with
someone
who
we
can't
trust
in
regards
to
an
application,
how
can
we
trust
him
again,
not
only
with
the
assets,
but
the
security
guards
deal
with
the
safety
of
the
children.
they
deal
with
part
of
the
educational
processes.
they
are
part
of
the
providers.
that
is
the
difference
in
these
cases,
that
we
are
dealing
with
boards
of
education.
the
interests
of
not
only
the
governmental
entity
but
those
to
whom
it
serves
merge.
we
are
serving
pupils.
education
is
our
business.
and
we
have
to
get
on
with
the
business
of
that.
we
don't...
the
civil
service
commissions
are
totally
independent
bodies,
and
once
the
process
kicks
into
the
civil
service
commission,
the
board
of
education
has
very
little
to
do
with
it.
under
the
ohio
revised
code,
promptly
afterwards,
within
ten
days
he
has
the
right
to
file
an
appeal,
and
it
kicks
out
and
is
handled
by
civil
service.
it
is
not
handled
by
boards
of
education.
their
employees,
their
time
is
not
spent
in
that
process.
mr.
james
g.
wyman
that's
correct.
mr.
james
g.
wyman
that's
correct,
they've
said
that--
mr.
james
g.
wyman
--for
a
decision.
now,
we
are
talking
two
different
issues,
your
honor.
for
the
initial
hearing,
it
took
two
and
a
half
months,
and
it
is
interesting
to
note
also--
mr.
james
g.
wyman
--that's
correct.
the
courts,
the
ohio
courts
have
held
that
it
is
not
binding
because
of
the
tremendous
volume--
mr.
james
g.
wyman
--the
assurance
is--
mr.
james
g.
wyman
--well,
our
position
is
that
there
was
in
fact
a
prompt
post-termination
hearing
in
this
case.
there
is
no
question
he
had
a
hearing
within
the
two
and
a
half
months.
although
that
might
be
lengthy
to
some,
in
the
scheme
of
the
volume,
tremendous
volume
of
cases
that
are
heard
by
that
commission,
which
is
well
over...
in
the
thousands,
that
is
not
particularly
a
lengthy
time.
it
is
also
interesting
to
note
that
during
that
two
and
a
half
months
you
had
thanksgiving,
you
had
christmas,
and
you
had
new
years'.
mr.
james
g.
wyman
we
have
a
lot
of
public
employees,
your
honor.
mr.
james
g.
wyman
yes.
mr.
james
g.
wyman
we
would
submit
that
it
would
not
have.
part
of
my
argument
was
the
fact
that
the
only
thing
he
could
say
was,
i
didn't...
i
was
ignorant
of
the
law.
his
ignorance
of
the
law
did
not
go
to
the
merits
of
the
decision.
basically
it
would
be
a
dixon
versus
love
type
of
situation.
he
would
be
begging
for
clemency
as
opposed
to
challenging
the
factual
basis
for
the
determination.
mr.
james
g.
wyman
from
the
board
of
educations'
point
of
view,
no.
thank
you.
mr.
james
g.
wyman
yes,
i
do,
your
honor,
a
number
of
statements,
possibly
factual
clarifications.
first
of
all,
the
liberty
interest
is
not
at
issue
here.
there
are
no
facts
in
the
complaint
or
the
pleadings
before
this
court
which
would
reflect
that
there
was
any
communication
of
any
of
the
allegations
or
the
charges
made
by
the
board
of
education
in
regards
to
dishonesty.
in
further
way
of
clarification,
mr.
donnelly's
initial
hearing
was
well
within
the
30-day
time
limitation.
i
think
it
is
important
for
this
court
to
know
that.
very
briefly,
mr.
fertel
has
chastised
me
possibly,
and
with
all
due
respect
to
him,
concerning
the
what-ifs
and
the
fact
that
mr.
loudermill
would
have
in
fact
been
fired
even
if
we
had
had
some
sort
of
pretermination,
but
he
has
then
gone
on
with
a
number
of
his
own
what-ifs,
what
if
he
loses
his
house,
his
wife,
his
children.
i
don't
think
that
is
valid
for
the
court
to
consider.
i
don't
think
those
facts
are
before
it.
we
have
one
issue
before
this
court,
and
that
is
due
process,
and
what
is
fundamentally
fair
to
the
employees
involved.
it
must
be
kept
in
mind,
and
i
would
urge
this
court
to
keep
in
mind
the
fact
that
the
due
process
rights
impact
not
only
upon
the
governmental
entity
in
this
case
but
also
upon
those
whom
we
serve,
which
are
the
pupils.
we
are
in
the
business
of
education,
as
i
said
before,
and
there
are
treatises
out
that
consider
us
to
be
a
nation
at
risk.
it
is
important
for
us
to
get
on
with
the
business
of
education,
not
with
establishing
elaborate
routines
and
procedures
for
our
employees.
that
is
taken
care
of
under
ohio
revised
code
124.34.
it
provides
for
due
process
hearings.
they
are
de
novo
hearings.
they
are
hearings
that
are
by
an
objective
board.
we
feel
they
are
appropriate
underneath
the
ohio
revised
code
and
the
due
process
standards
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
we
respectfully
request
this
court
to
affirm
the
district
court's
decisions
of
the
dismissal,
to
reverse
the
sixth
circuit
in
regards
to
the
pretermination
issue,
to
find
that
ohio
revised
code
section
124.34
is
in
fact
constitutional
and
adequately
protects
the
rights
of
those
that
are
affected.
the
process
that
the
respondents
were
due
was
given.
thank
you.
