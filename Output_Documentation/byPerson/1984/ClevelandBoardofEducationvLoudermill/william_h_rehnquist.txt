justice
rehnquist
in
donnelly's
case,
the
ultimate
disposition
was
changed
from
discharge
to
suspension.
justice
rehnquist
what
was
the
basis
on
which
the
civil
service
commission
made
that
change?
justice
rehnquist
and
he
accepted
that.
justice
rehnquist
is
donnelly
a
party
to
this
litigation?
justice
rehnquist
i
suppose
it
doesn't
make
a
lot
of
difference
to
mr.
loudermill
whether
he
is
suspended
without
pay
and
then
granted
a
hearing
and
ultimately
discharged
after
the
hearing
or
whether
he
is
discharged
and
given
a
hearing
after
that.
if
he
doesn't
get
back
pay
during
the
time
of
suspension,
it
is
six
of
one
and
half
a
dozen
of
the
other.
justice
rehnquist
what
is
the
time
allowed
for
answer,
say,
under
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure
to
answer
a
complaint?
justice
rehnquist
twenty
days.
do
you
think
there
is
a
constitutional
difference
between
20
days
and
10
days?
justice
rehnquist
well,
it
seems
to
me
your
argument
defeats
itself,
because
if
there
are
no
pretermination
procedures,
then
any
amount
of
notice
or
no
notice
at
all
is
really
satisfactory,
because
there
is
nothing
to
be
done.
justice
rehnquist
then
the
amount
of
days
that
go
by
between
the
notice
and
the
action
isn't
really
relevant,
is
it?
you
are
saying
that
presumably
he
could
have
gotten
this
letter
and
six
months
could
have
gone
by
before
the
board
acted,
and
yet
if
the
board
hadn't
specified
that
there
were
pretermination
procedures,
your
argument
would
be
the
same,
wouldn't
it?
justice
rehnquist
let's
boil
your
argument
down
a
little.
supposing
that
he
received
exactly
this
letter
that
he
did
receive,
but
instead
of
the
school
board
acting
in
ten
days
it
acted
in
six
months.
wouldn't
your
argument
be
pretty
much
the
same,
that
they
didn't
specify
any
pretermination
procedures?
justice
rehnquist
so
what
difference
does
the
amount
of
time
between
the
notice
and
the
action
of
the
school
board
make
to
your
argument?
justice
rehnquist
you
contend
this
termination
was
in
violation
of
that
section
of
ohio
law?
justice
rehnquist
what
if
the
school
board's
approach
was,
we
are
not
so
worried
about
the
felony,
we
are
worried
you
lied
about
the
felony?
justice
rehnquist
well,
so
then
the
school
board's
action
doesn't
violate
ohio
law.
the
two-year
section
that
you
mention,
if
they
are
terminating
for
dishonesty
rather
than
for
a
conviction
of
a
felony.
justice
rehnquist
what
if
the
school
board
had
followed
the
action
which
mr.
wyman,
your
opponent,
was
quizzed
about,
if
they
had
simply,
when
this
information
came
to
their
attention,
they
had
suspended
him
without
pay,
and
he
had
then
gotten
a
hearing
in
the
same
manner
that
he
did,
and
the
hearing
board,
the
civil
service
commission
says,
well,
we
are
converting
your
suspension
into
a
discharge?
he
had
an
opportunity
to
testify
and
all
that
before
the
civil
service
commission.
would
that
have
comported
with
due
process?
justice
rehnquist
well,
supposing
then
that
there
had
been
a
suspension
without
pay
followed
by
a
hearing
which
would
meet
your
definition
of
a
prompt
hearing,
and
the
civil
service
commission
then
said,
we
convert
the
suspension
into
a
discharge.
would
that
have
comported
with
due
process?
justice
rehnquist
well,
but
you
are
saying
in
effect
that
ohio
can't
channel
all
of
these
civil
service
questions
to
the
civil
service
commission.
you
are
saying
that
initially
it
has
to
be
a
hearing
before
the
employer
who
is
taking
action
rather
than
the
civil
service
commission.
justice
rehnquist
so
if
ohio
wants
to
channel
these
personnel
matters
to
the
civil
service
commission,
then
the
civil
service
commission
would
have
to
make
the
initial
suspension
decision.
justice
rehnquist
supposing
ohio
says,
we
want
all
these
personnel
matters
to
be
considered
by
a
uniform
body
in
the
jurisdiction,
to
wit,
the
civil
service
commission.
nobody
car
be
suspended
or
discharged
except
by
the
civil
service
commission.
now,
then
would
you
say
it
is
all
right
if
the
civil
service
commission
made
both
the
decision
to
suspend
and
the
decision
to
discharge?
justice
rehnquist
do
you
contend
the
civil
service
commission
in
your
case
was
not
an
impartial
decision-maker?
justice
rehnquist
mr.
fertel,
you
have
said
several
times
that
a
person
in
loudermill's
situation
loses
his
wife
and
children.
is
that
what
in
fact
happened
to
mr.
loudermill?
justice
rehnquist
so
you
are
referring
to
this
particular
case?
justice
rehnquist
are
there
statistics
that
show
that
if
a
person
becomes
unemployed
he
is
very
likely
to
lose
his
wife
and
his
children?
justice
rehnquist
that's
the
time
his
wife
divorces
him?
