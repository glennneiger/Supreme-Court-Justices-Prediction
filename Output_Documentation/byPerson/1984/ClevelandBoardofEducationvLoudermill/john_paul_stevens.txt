justice
stevens
may
i
just
ask,
on
the
notice
of
the
second...
the
right
to
take
a
second
exam,
he
alleges,
as
i
remember,
that
there
was
another
employee
who
had
failed
the
exam
and
was
still
working
there.
is
it
clear
that
he
knew
that
flunking
the
eye
exam
would
cause
his
discharge?
justice
stevens
mr.
wyman,
why
wouldn't
the
boards'
interest
be
adequately
served
by
immediate
suspension
and
an
opportunity
to
make
a
response
in
24
hours,
or
something
like
that?
what
harm
would
that
be?
justice
stevens
but
you
would
agree
that
there
would
be
no
prejudice
to
the
board
if
there
were
an
immediate
suspension
followed
by
an
option
to
respond
before
the
suspension
ripened
into
a
discharge.
justice
stevens
may
i
just
ask
one
other
question?
if
he
had
had
a
pretermination
opportunity
to
respond,
would
the
response
perhaps
have
been
considered
by
the
school
board
instead
of
the
civil
service?
justice
stevens
would
it
possibly
have
been
a
different
decisionmaker?
justice
stevens
isn't
that
perhaps
a
relevant
point,
that
maybe
there
would
have
been
room
for
clemency
immediately
before
the
board,
but
it
wouldn't
be
a
legally
sufficient
basis
for
objecting
before
the
civil
service
commission?
isn't
there
a
possibility
of
a
different
disposition,
depending
on
the
timing?
justice
stevens
may
i
ask,
mr.
fertel,
what
remedy
do
you
think
your
clients
are
entitled
to
at
the
end
of
the
road,
and
what
do
you
think
the
issues
would
be
at
trial?
i
have
in
mind
the
mount
healthy
problem,
that
say
they
proved
they
would
have
fired
him
anyway,
even
if--
justice
stevens
--what
if
he
had
a
trial
and
the
federal
judge
or
the
jury
decided,
well,
we
don't
believe
his
story,
just
as
apparently
the
civil
service
commission
did?
justice
stevens
i
understand,
but
supposing
at
this
trial
that
you
seek
to
have
now
the
determination
is
that,
well,
we
analyze
the
facts
exactly
like
the
civil
service
board
did,
that
he
was
in
fact
dishonest.
then
what...
would
you
be
entitled
to
any
remedy
then?
