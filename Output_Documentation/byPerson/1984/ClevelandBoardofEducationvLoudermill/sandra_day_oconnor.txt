justice
o'connor
well,
now,
mr.
donnelly
was
reinstated,
i
take
it.
justice
o'connor
mr.
wyman,
may
i
inquire,
what
are
the
possible
remedies
for
a
wrongfully
discharged
employee
in
your
jurisdiction?
do
they
have
a
right
of
reinstatement
if
the
discharge
was
erroneous?
justice
o'connor
not
the
procedural
remedies,
the
substantive
remedies
available
are
reinstatement...
how
about
damages?
justice
o'connor
with
regard
to
the
procedural
remedies
available
to
such
an
employee,
you
rely
on
this
court's
decisions
in
arnett
and
in
matthews,
and
in
those
cases
the
court
upheld
postdeprivation
hearings
for
employees
where
there
was
an
opportunity
to
respond
before
the
discharge.
was
there
an
opportunity
to
respond
given
here?
and
is
that
part
of
the
scheme
in
place
in
your
jurisdiction?
justice
o'connor
mr.
wyman,
do
you
think
that
our
cases
indicate
there
has
to
be
an
opportunity
to
respond?
justice
o'connor
may
i
ask
you
about
the
promptness
of
the
postdeprivation
hearing?
the
law
says
that
it
will
be
granted
within
30
days,
does
it
not?
justice
o'connor
but
ohio
courts
have
said
that
is
not
mandatory.
justice
o'connor
and
in
this
instance
it
took
nine
months
for
a
decision.
justice
o'connor
and
the
ohio
court
simply
says
that
the
statutory
requirement
of
30
days
is
not
binding.
justice
o'connor
what
would
assure
a
prompt
postdeprivation
hearing
under
ohio's
scheme
then?
justice
o'connor
even
if
you
are
right.
justice
o'connor
mr.
fertel,
in
both
arnett
and
in
mathews,
this
court
found
no
due
process
violation,
despite
the
evidence
that
at
least
some
of
the
hearings
weren't
completed
for
more
than
a
year
after
the
deprivation
occurred.
how
do
you
distinguish
those
cases
then
in
making
you
argument
about
a
prompt
hearing?
justice
o'connor
mr.
fertel,
i
suppose
our
inquiry
for
the
purposes
of
due
process,
the
procedural
due
process
requirements
is
to
determine
what
is
fundamentally
fair
in
this
area,
right?
justice
o'connor
is
that
the
thrust
of
the
inquiry?
justice
o'connor
all
right,
and
if
that
is
so,
should
we
consider
as
part
of
the
fairness
inquiry
the
fact
that
the
state
had
established
certain
post-termination
procedures
of
which
the
employee
was
aware
when
he
accepted
the
position
of
employment
with
the
state?
does
that
have
any
impact
at
all
in
our
fairness
inquiry?
justice
o'connor
well,
even
if
you
don't
accept
that
fully,
that
all
he
can
ever
get
is
what
the
state
provides,
even
if
you
don't
accept
that,
do
you
think
that
it
has
any
role
at
all
in
the
process
of
determining
what
is
basically
fair?
justice
o'connor
opportunity
to
respond.
justice
o'connor
do
you
think
that
has
to
be
a
statutory
opportunity,
expressed
in
statute,
or
can
it
be
given
in
fact?
