justice

so
there
was
as
posttermination
hearing?
justice
white
and
that
went
on
for
ten
months
in
the
case
of
loudermill?
justice
white
you
mean
you
told
them
you
were
about
to
fire
them,
and
then
there
was
some
time?
justice
white
well,
in
donnelly's
case
it
may
be
that
if
you
had
given
him
an
opportunity
to
respond,
he
never
would
have
been
suspended,
or
laid
off.
justice
white
there
was
a
communication
back
and
forth
in
donnelly's
case?
justice
white
well,
i
know,
but
couldn't
at
that
stage
the
same
reason
have
been...
couldn't
the
same
reason
have
emerged
to
keep
him
on
that
later
reemployed
him?
justice
white
is
it
your
position...
suppose
that
it
was
perfectly
plain
that
there
was
quite
a
large
risk
of
error
in
this
case.
justice
white
is
it
the
board's
position
that
nevertheless
a
pretermination
hearing
need
not
be
given?
is
it
your
position
that
a
post-termination
hearing
always
is
enough?
justice
white
well,
however,
you
don't
suggest
that
we
redo
the
arnett
case?
justice
white
you
would
like
us
to.
justice
white
what
remedy
did
the
court
of
appeals
think
loudermill
was
going
to
get?
justice
white
it
certainly
didn't--
justice
white
--under
the
decision,
all
he
was
deprived
of
is
a
procedural
due
process.
justice
white
so
under
our
cases,
what
remedy
would
there
be?
a
peppercorn,
or
a
penny,
or
something?
justice
white
when
did
this
explanation
that
he
was
confused
between
a
felony
conviction
and
a
misdemeanor
conviction
first
appear?
justice
white
what
was
the
conduct?
is
that
shown
by
the
record?
what
was
the
conduct
for
which
he
was
convicted?
justice
white
the
majority
of
the
court.
