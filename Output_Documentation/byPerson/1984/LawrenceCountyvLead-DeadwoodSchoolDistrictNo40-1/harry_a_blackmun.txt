why
doesn't
your
view,
then,
amount
to
a
windfall
from
the
school
district?
you
already
have
60
percent,
and
presumably
that's
all
the
school
district
needs.
now,
if
additional
federal
funds
have
to
go
to
the
school
districts,
it's
60
percent
plus.
justice
blackmun
well,
sure.
but
whatever
figure
it
is,
the
schools
in
your
county
are
being
maintained
without
this
federal
infusion
of
funds,
are
they
not?
justice
blackmun
well,
then
anything
that
goes
to
the
school
district
from
the
federal
funds
is
a
windfall
to
is.
justice
blackmun
perhaps
an
unneeded
one.
justice
blackmun
well,
that's
what
you
want.
justice
blackmun
you're
here
representing
the
school
district.
