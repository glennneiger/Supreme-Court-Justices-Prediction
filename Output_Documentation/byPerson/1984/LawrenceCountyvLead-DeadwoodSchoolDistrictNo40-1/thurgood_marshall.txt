justice
marshall
that's
what
i
say.
this
is
not
an
ordinary
windfall;
this
is
in
lieu
of
taxes.
justice
marshall
well,
that's
not
an
ordinary
windfall.
windfall
is
where
they
give
you
something
you're
not
entitled
to.
justice
marshall
in
lieu
of
taxes.
justice
marshall
back
to
that
one.
just
who
is
losing
on
this?
justice
marshall
does
the
taxpayer
lose?
justice
marshall
yeah.
will
he
have
to
pay
more
taxes?
justice
marshall
how?
justice
marshall
this
is
political.
is
there
anything
in
there,
other
than
politics?
i
may
be
asking
the
same
question
differently.
who's
going
to
get
the
money
if
you
don't?
i
still
don't
understand.
justice
marshall
is
there
any
way
they
could
send
it
back
to
the
other
u.s.
taxpayers?
[laughter]
i
mean
you
interest
me
on
that.
justice
marshall
which
statute?
