mr.
fuller,
where
do
the
schools
in
your
state
derive
their
money
from
anyway?
justice
jr.
from
real
estate
taxes
in
the
school
district
or
in
the
county,
or
both?
justice
jr.
and
you
have
a
general
sales
tax
in
south
dakota,
state
sales
tax?
justice
jr.
and
does
the
state
appropriate
any
of
their
sales
tax
fund
either
to
the
county
or
to
the
school
districts?
justice
jr.
that
state
aid
comes
from
the
sales
tax
and
the
state
income
tax?
justice
jr.
now,
does
your
state
legislature
specifically
appropriate
money
for
the
public
schools?
justice
jr.
that
money
goes
directly
to
the
school
districts?
justice
jr.
real
estate
taxes?
justice
jr.
and,
in
addition,
the
county
levies
a
real
estate
tax
also?
justice
jr.
it's
not
unlimited.
