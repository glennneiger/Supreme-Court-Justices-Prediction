justice
o'connor
mr.
raywid,
the
counties
are
creatures
of
state
government,
in
a
sense.
they
are
created
by
the
state
legislature
to
serve
state
governmental
purposes.
do
you
think
that
the
state
legislature
in
south
dakota
could
have
passed
a
law
that
just
told
its
counties
they
may
not
accept
any
federal
aid,
period?
justice
o'connor
well,
you
concede,
i
gather,
that
the
state
could
have
prohibited
the
counties
from
accepting
any
federal
aid
altogether.
do
you
think
the
state
could
have
said
that
it
would
readjust
any
state
aid
that
it
supplies
the
counties
to
deduct
the
amount
that
a
county
is
receiving
from
the
federal
government
under
this
in
lieu
payment
act?
justice
o'connor
well,
isn't
the
purpose
of
south
dakota's
statute
in
this
instance
to
assure
that
school
districts
get
a
share
of
the
federal
payments
in
lieu
of
taxes?
justice
o'connor
well,
is
that
the
purpose
of
the
statute,
do
you
suppose?
justice
o'connor
can
you
think
of
some
other
purpose
that
the
statute
might
have?
justice
o'connor
which
would
assure
a
portion
of
it
going
to
school
districts.
justice
o'connor
does
that
purpose
conflict
with
the
congressional
intent,
do
you
suppose?
