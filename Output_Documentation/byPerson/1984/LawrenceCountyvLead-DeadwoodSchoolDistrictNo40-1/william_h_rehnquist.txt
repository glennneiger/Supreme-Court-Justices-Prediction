justice
rehnquist
you
described
the
second
sentence
in
the
statute,
mr.
raywid,
as
a
caveat;
a
unit,
and
they
use
the
payment
for
any
governmental
purpose.
you
see
that
as
a
restriction
on
what
the
governmental
unit
may
use
it
for.
justice
rehnquist
they
didn't
need
congress
to
tell
them
that.
justice
rehnquist
obliged
by
what
law?
justice
rehnquist
you
are
now
deducing
a
principle
of
federal
law
that
requires
the
state
of
south
dakota
to
adhere
to
its
own
statutes?
justice
rehnquist
but
isn't
the...
usually,
the
final
authority
as
to
whether
a
state
has
observed
its
own
laws
is
found
in
the
determination
of
the
highest
court
of
that
state,
is
it
not?
justice
rehnquist
and
here,
we
have
a
determination
of
the
supreme
court
of
south
dakota
that
what
the
state
has
done
has
consisted
with
south
dakota
law.
justice
rehnquist
it's
one
thing
to
say
that
congress
has
mandated
these
funds
to
the
counties
and
notwithstanding
the
relationship
between
the
counties
and
the
state,
the
congress
wanted
the
counties
to
have
the
final
authority
to
say
that.
that
is
certainly
an
understandable
argument
based
on
federal
law.
but
i
understood
you
to
make
an
argument
that
federal
law
also
somehow
requires
south
dakota,
the
legislature
to
observe
the
county
status
because
there
are
provisions
in
the
south
dakota
statute...
the
south
dakota
constitution
that
require
it.
justice
rehnquist
these
payments
are
in
lieu
of
what
would
be
real
property
taxes
that
the
government
would
pay
for
government-owned
land
in
the
county?
justice
rehnquist
and
there
is
no
question,
i
take,
it,
that
under
south
dakota
law,
if
these
lands
had
been
in
private
hands
and
taxes
had
been
paid
on
them,
the
state
legislature
could
have
told
lawrence
county
how
to
spend
the
taxes.
justice
rehnquist
i
didn't
mean
necessarily
that
the
state
legislature
had
adopted
such
a
regimen.
but
no
one
questions
that
it
has
the
power
to
do
so
if
it
isn't
granted
by
federal
law.
justice
rehnquist
or
it
could
tell
its
counties
that
out
of
each
dollar
of
real
property
tax
that
you
collect
at
the
county
level,
you
assign
60
percent
of
that
to
the
schools,
could
it
not?
justice
rehnquist
mr.
claiborne,
what
were
the
consequences
of
the
state
statute
here
as
to
these
particular
funds?
what
was
the
result
when
the
state
statute
was
applied--
justice
rehnquist
--but
the
school
district
is,
nonetheless,
in
the
county.
justice
rehnquist
but
it's
one
thing
for
congress
to
say
that
we're
not
going
to
try
to
supervise
the
expenditure
of
these
funds.
and
it's
another
thing
to
say
that
the
statute
goes
further
and
sets
the
counties
up
against
the
state.
justice
rehnquist
yes,
but
the
county
could
choose
not
to
furnish
any
services
to
your
lands,
the
way
the
statute
is
written,
could
it
not?
