justice
stevens
may
i
ask
this
question?
you
say
that
they
created
this
general
government
authority
of
the
county.
but
as
i
understand
the
state
laws,
the
county
doesn't
have
general
government
authority.
it
has
authority
with
respect
to
disbursement
of
funds,
according
to
a
formula
set
by
the
state.
isn't
that
right?
justice
stevens
with
respect
to
tax
revenues
anyhow.
justice
stevens
well,
aren't
they
required
to
expend
their
tax
revenues
in
certain
prorated
shares?
justice
stevens
but
it
doesn't
have
any
general
authority
to
disburse
funds
any
way
it
wants,
apart
from
these
funds,
does
it?
justice
stevens
well,
we're
talking
about
the
county
right
now.
the
county
must
allocate
its
tax
revenues
according
to
a
state-set
formula;
is
that
not
true?
justice
stevens
some
discretion,
but
isn't
that
discretion,
in
some
respect
at
least,
limited
by
state
law?
justice
stevens
what
do
they
want
to
use
the
money
for
in
this
case?
i
can't
quite
figure
it
out.
what
does
the
county
want
to
use
the
money
for
that
it's
being
disabled
from
using
it?
justice
stevens
so
it's
entirely
possible
the
county
may
decide
to
distribute
the
money
exactly
in
accordance
with
the
state
law,
isn't
it?
justice
stevens
and
you
must
acknowledge,
i
assume...
say
there's
a
state
law
against
spending
money
on
liquor
licenses
or
something
like
that.
you
couldn't
do
it
for
that
purpose.
justice
stevens
should
the
state
pass
a
statute
that
says
you
should
spend
no
more
than
$10
million
on
roads
in
any
one
county?
justice
stevens
even
though
they
were
used
for
a
valid
governmental
purpose
of
some
other
kind,
such
as
school?
justice
stevens
without
interference
from
the
state
legislature.
justice
stevens
can
you
find
that
in
this
statutory
language?
justice
stevens
are
you
saying
a
state
does
not
have
the
power
to
say
that
the
county
auditor
shall
be
a
mere
cashier
and
shall
spend
the
money
the
way
we
tell
him
to?
the
state
has
no
such
power.
justice
stevens
can
i
ask
you
in
this
example...
i
think
it's
in
the
government
brief...
a
very
costly
trial
because
a
crime
occurs
in
the
county.
and
then
you
talk
about
well,
maybe
they
want
to
use
the
money
for
that
purpose.
do
you
think
the
state
could
provide
that
the
costs
of
exceptionally
expensive
trials
of
the
character
described
there
shall
always
be
handled
with
state
funds
and
the
trial
shall
be
handled
by
the
state
attorney
general
and
no
local
funds
shall
be
used
for
such
purposes?
first
i'd
ask
you
could
they
do
that
with
tax
remedies
and,
secondly,
could
they
do
it
with
these
funds?
justice
stevens
they
could
prohibit
the
county
from
spending
money
for
that
particular
purpose
without
violating
the
federal
statute.
justice
stevens
just
say
we
will
pay
for
this
out
of
state
funds
in
this
county,
as
we
do
throughout
the
state.
justice
stevens
well,
but
isn't
the
state
the
best
entity
to
decide
whether
it
shall
be
done
within
its
borders
or
not?
not
congress
tell
them
you
have
to
let
the
county
make
this
decision?
justice
stevens
yes,
but
the
statute
clearly
says
the
federal
government
shall
not
say
how
the
money
shall
be
spent.
isn't
that
clear?
justice
stevens
and
it
clearly
disables
the
federal
government
itself
from
allocating
the
funds.
isn't
that
clear?
justice
stevens
mr.
clairborne,
i
don't
understand.
they
haven't
seized
any
money.
they're
just
saying
how
it
shall
be
spent
within
the
county.
maybe
it's
a
wasteful
to
spend,
but
i
just
don't
understand
the
analogy
to
diverting
the
money
out
of
the
county
which
led
to
the
enactment
of
the
statute.
justice
stevens
go
ahead.
finish.
justice
stevens
isn't
that
true
of
all
government
services,
that
they
are
budgeted
for
them,
and
whatever
the
federal
windfall
is,
it's
prorated
for
all
these
services?
justice
stevens
mr.
fuller,
you
raised
the
question
about
the
60
percent
a
couple
of
times
in
your...
who
determines,
what
governmental
body
determines
the
percentage
of
tax
revenues
that
shall
be
given
to
the
school
district?
justice
stevens
is
it
a
county
budget
or
a
state
budget?
justice
stevens
so
that
the
county
has
a
voice
in
determining
the
allocation
of
tax
revenues.
is
that
correct?
justice
stevens
yes,
but
what
i
mean
is,
the
decision
as
to
what
percentage...
is
the
percentage
the
same
in
every
county
throughout
the
state?
justice
stevens
so
that
the
percentage
that's
in
effect
in
the
county
in
dispute
here
is
really
largely
governed
by
what
happens
in
that
county.
justice
stevens
and
all
the
state
has
said
is,
you've
got
to
follow
the
same
percentage
for
other
funds
in
that
county.
justice
stevens
who
is
going
to
get
the
money
if
you
don't?
your
opponent
doesn't
seem
to
know.
he
seems
to
acknowledge
it's
possible
they'll
divvy
it
up
exactly
as
the
statute
proposes.
justice
stevens
did
they
ever
tell
you
what
they're
going
to
do?
are
they
going
to
just
raise
their
salaries?
what
have
they
been
doing
with
it?
justice
stevens
would
you
agree
that
it
doesn't
entirely
remove
the
discretion,
because
the
basic
allocation
is
at
least
partially
determined
by
the
county
itself?
justice
stevens
and
it
probably
in
doing
that
can
anticipate
it
will
be
getting
some
federal
funds
in
the
following
year.
justice
stevens
but
it
does
participate
in
the
decision
whether
the
school
district
will
get
60
or
39
or
59
percent
of
the
tax
revenues.
justice
stevens
so
it
does
have
a
part
in
the
allocation
of
these
funds,
too,
then.
