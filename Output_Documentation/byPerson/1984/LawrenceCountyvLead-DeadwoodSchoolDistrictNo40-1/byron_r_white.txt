justice
white
yes,
but
the
60
percent,
the
60
percent
results
from
the
fact
that
the
school
district
makes
up
its
own
budget,
and
in
a
sense
is
a
taxing
authority
itself.
and
it
goes
to
the
county
and
says
here's
what
we
need
and
here's
what
the
assessment
should
be.
justice
white
and
the
county,
as
you
say,
has
very
little
to
say
about
it.
i
mean
the
county...
what
is
it...
board
of
commissioners
or--
justice
white
--the
board
of
commissioners
has
very
little
to
say
about
it.
justice
white
they
can't
cut
the
school
district
back.
justice
white
i
take
it,
if
you
prevail...
if
you
prevail,
you
can
predict
that
the
counties
are
going
to
get
certain
money
and
that
you
won't
have
to
assess
as
high
as
you
would
have
if
you
weren't
going
to
get
the
federal
money.
justice
white
so
you'll
be
saving
all
of
the
people
in
the
school
district
money.
justice
white
is
the
entire
county
covered
by
one
school
district
or
another?
justice
white
every
piece
of
non-government
land
is
covered
by
a
school
district?
justice
white
yes.
justice
white
so
if
the
government
wins...
if
the
government
wins
this
case,
it's
just
that
what
everybody
in
the
county
would
have
had
to
be
assessed
to
pay
the
county
expenses,
they
won't
have
to
be
assessed
as
much.
justice
white
so
how
much
difference
will
it
make
as
to
who...
in
terms
of
taxpayers...
what
taxpayer
group
shall
benefit
and
what
not?
justice
white
i
know
that
the
taxpayers
in
the
school
district
will
be
taxed
less
if
you
win.
justice
white
but
it
goes
by...
they
make
up
the
amount
that
goes
to
each
particular
school
district.
justice
white
based
on
some
formula?
justice
white
well,
what
if
some
district
is
getting
money
from
the
federal
government?
do
they
reduce
it?
justice
white
but
the
school
district
would
reduce
its
own
taxes.
justice
white
yes.
does
the
school
district
have
authority
to
levy
taxes
itself?
justice
white
they
certainly
wouldn't
spend
it
on
the
school
district,
i
take
it.
justice
white
well,
it's
also
their
position
that
they're
not
only
free,
but
obligated,
to
refuse
to
do
that,
if
they're
going
to
take
the
federal
money.
that's
their
position,
as
i
understand
it.
it's
not
just
a
political
position.
they
claim
they
have
not
only
a
legal
right,
but
an
obligation
not
to
live
up
to
the
federal...
to
the
state
statute,
if
they
to
spend
it
for
something
else.
justice
white
you
don't
think
that's
their
position?
justice
white
yes,
but
i
just
said
one
of
their
positions
is
that
they
have
a
legal
right
not
to
spend
it
that
way.
justice
white
so
it
just
isn't
a
political
position.
they
claim
they
have
a
legal
right
under
the
federal
statute.
justice
white
well,
that's
why
you're
here,
i
guess.
