mr.
raywid,
i
think
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.

chief
justice

let
me
try
and
hypothetically...
it
may
clear
it
up
for
me;
it
may
not.
suppose,
instead
of
the
federal
government
making
this
grant,
it
was
the
ford
foundation
or
the
rockefeller
foundation
said
we're
going
to
give
you
six
million
dollars
a
year
for
these
purposes.
there's
no
federal
supremacy
issue
there.
but
wouldn't
that
condition
be
enforceable?
chief
justice
burger
well,
aren't
you
suggesting
that
there's
a
condition
announced
in
this
statute?

justice

mr.
fuller.
chief
justice
burger
another
thing:
doesn't
the
legislative
history
suggest
at
least
that
congress
was
somewhat
concerned
about
what
states
did
sometimes
with
these
kinds
of
grants,
in
lieu
of
taxes
and
other
types
of
grants,
and
they
wanted
to
vest
the
control
entirely
in
the
county.
isn't
that
what
congress
said?
chief
justice
burger
but
you
said
when
the
county...
when
they
come
to
the
school
board,
the
school
board
refuses...
or
is
it
the
county
that
you
said...
the
county
refused
to
do
what
the
state
statute
purports
to
compel
them
to
do.
chief
justice
burger
that's
the
political
aspect
that
you
are
talking
about.
chief
justice
burger
except
that
the
county
has
different
ideas
from
the
state;
isn't
that
so?
chief
justice
burger
are
you
suggesting
that
the
state
statute
doesn't
put
any
constraints
on
them?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
you
have
about
three
minutes
remaining
mr.
raywid.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
thank
you,
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
