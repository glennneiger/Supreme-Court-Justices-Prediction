mr.
a.
p.
fuller
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
this
case
doesn't
deal
with
a
whole
lot
of
things.
it
doesn't
deal
with
a
sovereignty;
we're
dealing
with
a
county
government.
we
are
not
dealing
with
where
the
"in
lieu
of"
money
is
to
be
paid.
the
money
is
paid
to
lawrence
county,
and
that's
where
it
should
be
paid.
we're
not
asking
the
secretary
of
interior
to
make
"in
lieu
of"
payments
to
the
school
district.
we
are
not
asking
that
these
payments
be
used
for
anything
but
governmental
purposes.
we're
not
dealing
with
the
secretary
of
interior
putting
restrictions
on
the
use
of
this
money
from
the
federal
level.
that's
not
in
here.
we're
not
dealing
with
any
other
statute
because
the
state
of
south
dakota
is
the
only
state
that
has
a
statute
like
this.
the
arkansas
statute
dealt
with
all
school
monies
in
the
denning
case;
all
school
monies
that
come
to
the
state
shall
be
distributed
to
the
schools.
well,
in
the
denning
case,
it
specifically
pointed
out
in
the
decision
that,
assuming
arguendo,
that
the
monies
are
for
school.
we
are
not
even
claiming
that
they're
school
monies.
we
are
not
dealing
with
a
statute
nor
a
regulation
which
prohibits
the
county
from
distributing
these
monies
to
the
school
districts.
what
we
are
dealing
with
is
a
statute
that
gives
the
counties,
as
well
as
many
state
statutes
under
title
vii
of
the
south
dakota
code,
direction
and
guidance
and
powers
and
responsibilities.
mr.
a.
p.
fuller
i
think
that's
the
practical
effect.
mr.
a.
p.
fuller
i
don't...
i
was
not
present
when
the
statute...
when
511--
mr.
a.
p.
fuller
--there
are
other
governmental
entities
that
the
county
distributes
money
to,
like
water
conservance
of
the
subdistricts,
or
water
districts,
conservance
of
subdistricts,
fire
districts,
and
other
governmental
entities
that
gather
the
money.
but
as
to
the
reason
that
the
legislature
passed
this,
i
think
you
must
recall,
in
the
section,
the
section
deals
with
"in
lieu
of"
monies.
in
other
words,
the
state
also
pays
in
lieu
of
tax
monies.
and
the
amendment
added
the
word
"federal".
so
that
all
federal
and
state
"in
lieu
of"
monies
would
be
distributed
by
the
auditor
as
all
tax
revenues
were
then
distributed,
which
is
the
counties--
mr.
a.
p.
fuller
--yes.
practically
speaking,
yes.
it
does
assure
that.
it's
not
60
percent,
so
that
we
understand
that.
mr.
a.
p.
fuller
well,
now
i
don't
think
so.
i
don't
think...
the
statute
says
the
county
may
use
the
money
for
any
governmental
purpose.
it
does...
the
school
district
is
not
saying
that
the
county
is
to
use
the
money
for
school
purposes
or
fire
protection
purposes
or
police
protection
or
road
building.
it's
any
purpose,
any
purpose
that
to
the
county
seems
fit
and
appropriate
is
the
way
they,
under
title
vii
of
our
code,
can
handle
the
money.
i
have
to
agree,
though.
the
practical
effect
is
that
the
monies
do...
some
of
the
monies,
not
necessarily
60
percent...
it's
whatever
the
budgetary
amount
of
money
that
a
school
district
needs
for
the
next
year.
mr.
a.
p.
fuller
well,
there's
nothing
magic
about
the
60
percent.
you
know,
it
varies,
depending
on--
mr.
a.
p.
fuller
--correct.
mr.
a.
p.
fuller
that
would
be
true--
mr.
a.
p.
fuller
--well,
that
i
can't
answer.
mr.
a.
p.
fuller
your
honor--
mr.
a.
p.
fuller
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
your
honor--
mr.
a.
p.
fuller
--that's
what
i
was
going
to
say.
but
thank
you.
you
see,
the
county
can
give
that
windfall,
if
you
want
to
call
it
a
windfall,
to
the
school
district
now;
but
let's
say
the
statute's
not
there,
they
could.
the
statute
is
there;
they
get
a
proportion
share
of
that.
the
county
can
get
the
windfall.
you
know,
there
are
many
governmental
services,
any
governmental
service,
many
things
that
would
then
receive
this
governmental
windfall.
it
also,
when
the
money
goes
to
the
school
district,
it's
in
lieu
of
real
estate
taxes,
and
real
estate
taxes
are
where
the
revenues
are
generated
to
support
the
school
districts,
support
the
counties,
support
the
municipalities,
and
all
these
other
local
governmental
entities.
mr.
a.
p.
fuller
that's
right.
it's
in
lieu--
mr.
a.
p.
fuller
--well,
but
congress...
i
have
to
agree
with
what
he's
saying
if
the
definition
is
proper,
because
congress
is
giving
the
counties
that
money.
mr.
a.
p.
fuller
right.
but
congress
did
not
have
to
pass
that
act
because
the
county
or
the
school
district
cannot
tax
those
federal
lands.
mr.
a.
p.
fuller
congress
was
concerned
about
all
the
things
you
mention.
and
that's
why
they
gave
the
money
to
the
county
government,
okay?
the
county
is
merely
distributing,
as
the
statute
says,
as
they
distribute
other
tax
money.
now,
it
seems
to
me
that
if
the
distribution
of
other
tax
money
is
fair,
reasonable,
and
equitable
under
situations
of
budgets
and
other
matters,
that
this
money
is
also
being
distributed
in
the
same
manner.
mr.
a.
p.
fuller
no
governmental
entity,
because
it's
through
the
budgetary
process.
you
have
a
county
or
a
school--
mr.
a.
p.
fuller
--it's
a
school
budget
and
a
county
budget.
mr.
a.
p.
fuller
it's
very
limited,
because
our
south
dakota
supreme
court
has
ruled
that
when
a
school
district
comes
before
the
county
board
of
equalization
and
they
need
x
number
of
dollars,
the
county
cannot
arbitrarily
reduce
the
assessed
valuation
so
that
the
school
district
will
not
have
the
monies
to
function.
mr.
a.
p.
fuller
oh,
no.
no.
mr.
a.
p.
fuller
oh,
absolutely.
mr.
a.
p.
fuller
that's
right.
anything
that's
paid
to
you
in
lieu
of
real
estate
taxes,
you
just
flip
the
percentages
in
and
apply
the
same
proportions.
mr.
a.
p.
fuller
that's
correct.
but--
mr.
a.
p.
fuller
--no...
yes,
the
board
of
commissioners.
mr.
a.
p.
fuller
they
have
very
little
to
say
about--
mr.
a.
p.
fuller
--they
cannot
cut
the
school
district
back.
the
mill
levies
are
set
by
state
statute.
assessed
valuations
are
set
by
counties.
mr.
a.
p.
fuller
that's
correct.
mr.
a.
p.
fuller
correct.
that's
the
bare
bones
practical
effect
of
the
money.
and
the
county,
you
see...
that's
why
it's
a
political
deal.
the
county
receiving
the
windfall
can
then
also
lower
their
mill
levies,
so
that
then
the
taxpayers
in
the
county--
mr.
a.
p.
fuller
--there
are
three
school...
excuse
me...
there
are
two
complete
school
districts
within
lawrence
county
and
a
portion
of
another
school
district.
so
there
are
a
two
and
a
fraction.
mr.
a.
p.
fuller
in
lawrence
county?
mr.
a.
p.
fuller
yes.
there's
governmental
land
in
every
school
district
in
lawrence
county.
mr.
a.
p.
fuller
that's
right.
mr.
a.
p.
fuller
well--
mr.
a.
p.
fuller
--correct.
and
no
one
knows
whether
the
people
in
the
county...
you
see,
not...
i
would
say
that
the
county
will
receive...
they
won't
lose
anything
either.
they
won't
lose
anything
and
the
school
district
won't
lose
anything,
except
for...
there's
political
considerations
here.
and
they're
serious
at
our
local
level,
and
that
is
who's
taxing
us?
is
it
the
county
taxing
us
or
is
it
the
school
district
taxing
us?
and
that
has
political
significance
at
the
local
level.
so
yes,
it
is
important
for
all...
for
distribution
of
this
money
to
be
equitably
distributed
as
the
county
does
it
now,
so
that
it's
spread;
it's
spread
the
same
as
all
other
tax
dollars,
and
there's
no
harm
to
anyone.
mr.
a.
p.
fuller
from
real
estate
taxes.
mr.
a.
p.
fuller
in
the
school
district.
mr.
a.
p.
fuller
yes.
mr.
a.
p.
fuller
not
specifically.
we
do
have
state
aid
to
the
local
school
districts,
yes,
based
upon
numbers
of
pupils
in
classrooms,
classroom
size.
mr.
a.
p.
fuller
it
comes
from
all
state
revenues.
we
don't
have
a
state
income
tax.
we
do
have
a
state
sales
tax,
and
we
have
other
taxes.
mr.
a.
p.
fuller
yes.
mr.
a.
p.
fuller
yes.
mr.
a.
p.
fuller
correct.
mr.
a.
p.
fuller
formula.
mr.
a.
p.
fuller
no,
sir.
they
do
not.
that
has
absolutely...
it's
totally
independent
from
any
federal
aid.
mr.
a.
p.
fuller
and
so
will
the
county.
mr.
a.
p.
fuller
yes.
mr.
a.
p.
fuller
yes.
mr.
a.
p.
fuller
correct.
mr.
a.
p.
fuller
no,
no.
it's
not
unlimited.
it's
based
upon
assessed
valuation
which
can
be
no
greater
than
60
percent
of
the
full
and
true
value,
as
determined
by
the
county,
times
a
certain
mill
that
we...
certain
different
governmental
entities
have
different
mill
levies,
which
is
a
formula.
mr.
a.
p.
fuller
well,
if
we
don't
get
the
money,
we
will.
mr.
a.
p.
fuller
does
the
taxpayer
lose?
mr.
a.
p.
fuller
he
may.
mr.
a.
p.
fuller
again,
depending
upon
the
governmental
needs
of
the
specific
time,
if
the
county
needs
a
great
deal
of
money,
then
yes.
if
they
don't
have
the
windfall--
mr.
a.
p.
fuller
--pardon
me?
mr.
a.
p.
fuller
well,
i
don't
think
so,
because
the
school
district
has
gone
to
the
county
on
numerous
occasions,
asking
them
to
please
do
what
the
state
statute
says,
and
they
continue
to
say
we
don't
have
to.
we
can
do
anything
we
want
with
the
money.
mr.
a.
p.
fuller
the
money
has
been
held
in
escrow,
gathering
interest--
mr.
a.
p.
fuller
--one
never
knows.
maybe
we
could
change
our
lobbying
techniques
and
get
it.
but
they
have
told
me
they
will
not
give
us
the
interest,
your
honor.
mr.
a.
p.
fuller
well,
we'd
like
to
keep
it
in
lawrence
county
and
we'd
like
to
keep
it
at
our
school
district,
where
it
should
be,
and
it
should
be
distributed
at
the
same.
i
frankly
think
that
lawrence
county
is
making
much
to
do
about
nothing.
if
they'd
just
do
what
the
statute
says,
we
could
go
on
about
our
business.
and
it
doesn't
conflict--
mr.
a.
p.
fuller
--the
state
statute.
it
doesn't
conflict.
there's
no
conflict
in
the
statute.
it's
not
an
obstruction
to
the
federal
scheme
of
things.
the
money
is
going
to
be
distributed
for
governmental
purposes.
mr.
a.
p.
fuller
correct.
mr.
a.
p.
fuller
correct.
maybe
they
want
to
build
a
bridge
or
a
road.
mr.
a.
p.
fuller
i'm
going
to
disagree
with
that.
mr.
a.
p.
fuller
no.
i
think
the
county
believes
that
they
could
give
all
this
money
to
the
school
district
if
they
wanted
to.
mr.
a.
p.
fuller
that's
correct.
mr.
a.
p.
fuller
correct.
and
they're
claiming
that
the
federal
statute
is
supreme
and
is
in
conflict
with
the
state
statute,
and
that's
where
i
and
the
school
district
can't
necessarily
see
the
conflict.
mr.
a.
p.
fuller
that's
correct.
the
county
is
governed
by
the
constitution
of
the
state
of
south
dakota.
they
are
not
a
sovereignty
unto
themselves.
article
ix
of
our
constitution
creates
counties...
excuse
me,
it
does
not
create
counties,
it
allows
the
legislature
to
create
counties.
and
the
legislature
has
created
lawrence
county
and
60-some
odd
other
counties
in
south
dakota.
they
are
creatures
of
state
government,
and
under
title
vii
of
our
statutes,
they
have
been
given
the
powers
that
our
legislature
has
allowed
them
to
have.
and
this
is
a
statute
similar
to
all
other
statutes.
it
gives
counties
guidance,
instruction
as
to
what
they
should
do,
and
that's
all
the
statute
does.
it
just
seems
that
if
counties,
in
their
process,
distribute
monies
in
a
fair,
reasonable,
and
prudent
way
on
an
annual
basis,
that
a
statute
that
directs
them
to
continue
that
proposition
with
federal
in
lieu
of
tax
monies
is
not
in
conflict
with
the
federal
statute
that
is
presently
before
this
court.
mr.
a.
p.
fuller
the
county...
well,
the
state
is
not
telling
them
how
to
spend
the
money.
the
county
decides
that
at
the
local
level.
they
are
just
saying
do
it
the
way
you
do
it.
mr.
a.
p.
fuller
you're
talking
about...
yes,
it
tells
them
about
vouchering
and
bonding
and
bonds
of
indebtedness
and
all
that.
sure,
there
are
constraints.
but
these
are
expenditures.
these
are
tax
monies
in
and
these
are
disbursements
out,
your
honor.
and
counties
have
pretty
much
general
latitude
as
long
as
they're
paying
the
bills
that
are
authorized
by
law.
the
restrictions
aren't
that
great.
