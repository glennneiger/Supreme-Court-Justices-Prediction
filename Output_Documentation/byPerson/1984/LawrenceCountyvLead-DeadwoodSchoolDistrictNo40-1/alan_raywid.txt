mr.
alan
raywid
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
this
appeal
challenges
the
validity
of
a
state
statute
which
would
alter
and
redirect
the
distribution
of
federal
funds
payable
to
local
units
of
government
paid
for
the
presence
of
non-taxable
federal
land
which
are
located
within
the
jurisdiction
of
these
local
units
of
government.
the
federal
statute
known
as
payment
in
lieu
of
taxes,
or
its
acronym,
pilt,
is
perhaps
a
new
concept
of
awarding
federal
funds
for
the
non-taxable
lands
by
conferring
upon
local
communities,
local
units
of
government,
the
discretion
of
how
these
funds
may
be
best
spent
to
offset
the
impact
caused
by
the
presence
of
federal
lands
within
their
particular
communities.
it
is
the
result
of
years
of
careful
study
as
to
how
most
effectively
to
offset
this
adverse
impact
of
federal
lands.
and
it
substitutes
prior
programs
of
designated
use,
such
as
designation
for
school
districts
or
designation
of
roads,
to
allow
the
discretionary
use
by
these
governmental
units
and
with
the
only
caveat
that
they
be
for
any
governmental
purpose.
the
program
is
rather
broad.
it
goes
to
49
states.
mr.
alan
raywid
i'm
glad
you
called
me
on
that,
justice
rehnquist,
because
no,
i
do
not
see
that
as
a
limitation
at
all.
and
"caveat"
is
the
wrong
word.
"any
governmental
purpose"
is
perhaps
redundant.
i
think
the
purpose
that
that
was
placed
in
the
statute,
to
show
that
it
could
go
for
the
whole
panoply
of
government
services
that
a
local
unit
of
government
could
make
expenditures.
of
course
it
couldn't...
no
unit
of
government
can
make
unauthorized
or
discriminatory
payments.
mr.
alan
raywid
they
did
not
need
congress
to
tell
them
that.
i
believe
those
words...
and
i'm
glad
you
asked
the
question,
because
i
think
that
merely
underscores
the
breadth
of
discretion
allowable
to
a
local
unit
of
government.
mr.
alan
raywid
perhaps
the
legislature
could
have
declined
altogether
the
federal
aid.
this
particular
state
statute,
of
course,
is
tiered
upon
and
built
upon
the
federal
aid.
the
federal
aid
precedes
it
by
three
years.
but
in
following
your
question,
the
state,
of
course,
is
sovereign.
the
state
created
the
counties,
and
conferred
upon
the
counties
particular
authority.
it
allows
for
elected
officials;
it
allows
for
them
to
devise
a
budget;
it
allows
them
to
make
allocations
between
particular
governmental
responsibilities
acting
within
that
county.
now,
once
having
created
such
an
entity
under
the
state
constitution
of
south
dakota,
it
cannot
destroy
that
entity,
except
with
popular
vote.
but
perhaps
the
state
need
not
have
created
this
county.
having
done
so,
and
having
conferred
on
it
governmental
powers,
the
state
is
obliged
to
respect
those
powers
the
same
as
anyone
else.
mr.
alan
raywid
well,
obliged
by
the
precedent
of
this
court.
this
court
has
instructed
federal
agencies,
for
instance,
that
they
need
not
promulgate
regulations,
but
when
they
do
promulgate
regulations,
they
are
obliged
to
observe
them
the
same
as
private
parties.
mr.
alan
raywid
well,
the
state
of
south
dakota,
like
any
other
entity,
must
observe
its
own
laws.
mr.
alan
raywid
it
is
indeed.
mr.
alan
raywid
well,
the
state
of
south
dakota
went
much
further
than
that.
the
state
of
south
dakota
interpreted
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
and
interpreted
the
statute
of
congress
in
seeking
an
accommodation,
not
only
between
its
statutes
and
its
constitution,
but
with
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
and
the
congressional
statute--
mr.
alan
raywid
--well,
i
think
that
what
the
federal
statute
attempted
to
do
was
to
confer
authority,
discretionary
authority
for
the
expenditure
of
funds
on
the
local
unit
of
government.
it
then,
of
course,
looked
to
the
state
government
as
to
what
units
of
local
government
had
been
created.
in
south
dakota,
there
is
no
question
but
that
the
state
of
south
dakota
had
created
counties
and
conferred
upon
them
general
governmental
authority.
also,
the
statute,
the
federal
statute,
the
pilt
statute,
distinguished
between
specific
purpose
districts,
such
as
school
districts
or
water
districts
or
fire
districts
that
did
not
have
general
governmental
authority,
even
though
they
may
not
have
been
placed
with
authority
by
the
state,
and
even
though
they
might
be
governed
by
elected
officials.
but,
yes,
the
federal
statute
does
look
to
the
state
to
say
which
governmental
unit
has
the
local
authority
and
which
governmental
unit
has
general
governmental
authority.
mr.
alan
raywid
no,
justice
o'connor.
i
believe
very
definitely
it
could
not.
if
it
wished
to
accept
the
federal
aid...
it
would
have
to
accept
the
federal
aid
subject
to
the
conditions
imposed
by
congress.
it
is
obliged
to
carry
out
the
purpose
and
intent
of
congress;
that
is
the
fundamental
precept
of
the
supremacy
clause.
and
this
court
has
held
again
and
again,
in
both
majority
and
dissenting
opinions,
that
the
purpose
and
intent
of
congress,
of
course
acting
within
its
constitutional
authority,
is
paramount
and
that
the
state
may
not
interfere
with
that
purpose
and
intent.
and
the
fundamental
purpose
and
intent
of
this
act,
both
by
its
language
and
certainly
by
its
legislative
history,
is
to
confer
upon
the
counties,
to
confer
upon
the
unit
of
local
government
that
allocate
funds
for
a
variety
of
purposes,
to
decide
how
that
government
land
has
impacted
by
its
presence,
and
to
decide
how
those
funds
may
best
be
used.
mr.
alan
raywid
no,
justice
stevens,--
mr.
alan
raywid
--i
don't
understand
that
to
be
the--
mr.
alan
raywid
--well,
the
county
does
have
limited
authority,
and
it
does
not
have
general
legislative
authority.
mr.
alan
raywid
there
are
certain
units
of
government,
such
as
primarily
the
schools--
mr.
alan
raywid
--no,
justice
stevens.
i
believe
that
is
not
true.
as
i
understand
the
process,
each
of
the
various
recipients,
respective
recipients
of
funds,
submit
to
the
county
their
budgets
for
the
year.
the
county
then
has
some
discretion
as
to
what
budgets
it
will
accept
or
whether
those
budgets
have
to
be
altered
and
adjusted.
then
it
goes
out
and
raised
the
money,
and
then
it
makes
the
distribution.
but
it
is
not
simply
a
cashier
for
the
various
districts.
it
does
exercise
some
discretion.
mr.
alan
raywid
well,
indeed
it
is.
mr.
alan
raywid
well,
i
believe
that
the
county
has,
with
great
reserve,
not
made
any
determination
as
to
the
use
of
the
funds
until
it
determines
the
outcome
of
this
litigation.
mr.
alan
raywid
well,
again
i
differ
with
you.
you
mean
this
particular
state
law?
that
is
conceivable.
it
may
also--
mr.
alan
raywid
--no.
it
would
be
within
the
governmental
purposes
as
defined
by
state
law.
we
would
concede
that.
mr.
alan
raywid
i
do
not
think
that
they
could
place
a
limitation
on
the
federal
funds
which
had
been
given
to
that
particular
county,
and
could
not
do
by
indirection
what
they
could
not
do
by
direction.
the
purpose
of
the
federal
funds...
in
that
instance,
they
might
have
to
refund
to
the
federal
government
those
funds
which
the
state
attempted
to
proscribe
its
spending.
mr.
alan
raywid
well,
the
fundamental
purpose
of
the
act
is
for
this
county
to
decide
how
these
federal
lands
have
impacted
upon
it,
and
to
spend
accordingly.
it
is
in
furtherance--
mr.
alan
raywid
--without
interference
by
the
state
legislature.
mr.
alan
raywid
this
statutory
language
would
make
the
county
auditor
a
mere
cashier,
just
to
receive
the
funds
and
then
to
disburse
them
according
to
a
formula.
and
that
would--
mr.
alan
raywid
--the
state
has
no
such
power
when
the
exercise
of
that
power
would
entirely
gut
the
purpose
and
intent
of
congress
in
conferring
jurisdiction
and
discretion
on
the
local
unit
of
government
to
make
such
a
decision.
mr.
alan
raywid
that
is
correct
in
this
particular
instance.
it
applies...
the
total
land
acreage
is
some
450
million
acres.
in
lawrence
county,
it
comprises
over
half
the
county,
are
federal
lands.
and
they
are,
of
course,
removed
from
the
tax
base.
mr.
alan
raywid
no,
your
honor.
i
believe
under
the
creation
of
the
county
system,
the
county
does
exercise
discretion
as
to
how
much
taxes
it
is
going
to
raise.
it
has
a
provision
in
its
operating
mandate
that
it
cannot
spend
more
than
it
takes
in.
it
takes...
it
receives
budgets,
as
i
was
explaining
previously.
it
receives
budgets.
it
then
allocates
what
it
feels
appropriate
for
each
particular
governmental
service.
and
then
it
raises
the
money.
mr.
alan
raywid
well,
i
suppose
the
state
of
south
dakota
could
eliminate
its
local
government
altogether
and
also
remove
its
taxing
authority.
mr.
alan
raywid
it
could.
it
could
mandate
that.
then
it
would
be
up
to
the
federal
government
to
decide
at
that
juncture
whether
this
was
a
general
governmental
unit
with
power
to
exercise
such
discretion.
but
clearly,
in
accommodating,
it
seems
to
me,
the
state
statute
with
the
federal
statute,
which
was
to
give
discretion...
and
it
specifically
states
in
its
legislative
history
and
in
its
implementing
regulations
that
this
is
not
to
go
to
special
districts
or
not
for
special
units
of
service
such
as
school
districts,
and
it
is
not
to
go
to
states.
it
is
to
go
to
the
smallest
unit
of
local
government
in
which
that
land
is
located.
as
i...
this
is
a
program
that
was
some
20
years
in
the
study,
and
by
a
creature
of
congress,
a
commission
created
back
in
1964,
with
its
report
in
1970
saying
that
we
should
do
away
with
all
of
the
federal
land
programs
that
in
place
that
designate
the
use,
that
try
to
determine
for
particular
communities
how
they
can
best
spend
the
money,
and
let
those
communities
decide
how
they
must
use
the
aid.
the
legislative
history
and
the
testimony
show
such
a
variance
of
conditions,
disaster,
court
trials,
all
kinds
of
different
impact.
and
more
often,
the
benefits
such
as
from
a
national
park,
which
receives
a
number
of
visitors,
which
receives
a
number
of
expenditures
because
of
the
presence
of
the
national
park,
go
not
to
the
local
community
in
sales
tax
or
in
corporate
income
tax,
but
they
go
to
the
state.
this
was
an
attempt
to
direct
those
fund
to
where
that
land
was
located
and
because--
mr.
alan
raywid
--well,
depending
upon
the
state
constitution
and
depending
upon
the
jurisdictional
authority,
i
suppose
that
the
state
could
assume
those
funds.
i
also--
mr.
alan
raywid
--or
could
supplement--
mr.
alan
raywid
--yes,
but
as
the
congress
observed
and
as
the
congress
noted,
states
don't
do
that.
mr.
alan
raywid
perhaps
the
state
is
the
best
entity,
generally,
to
make
such
decisions.
but
this,
mind,
you
is...
concerns
government-owned
land.
and
the
management
of
government-owned
land
is
exclusively
within
the
constitutional
power
of--
mr.
alan
raywid
--the
statute
clearly
confers
to
the
local
unit
of
government,
yes.
mr.
alan
raywid
in
that
particular
section.
in
that
particular
section,
it
wants
to
pass
the
discretion
to
the
individual.
mr.
alan
raywid
this
is
the
only
statute
in
the
country
that
seems...
or
the
only
state
in
the
country
that
seems
it
is
necessary
to
make
some
reallocation.
mr.
justice
white
asked
whether
this
will
be
a
windfall
for
the
taxpayers
of
that
county.
that
certainly
was
not
the
purpose.
the
purpose
in
granting
discretion
for
the
presence
of
these
lands
was
that
the
benefits
would
redound
to
the
landholder,
the
united
states
of
america.
and
the
funds
are
those
from
the
taxpayers
of
the
united
states
of
america.
no
other
state
has
felt
it
necessary
to
take
away
this
local
discretion.
arkansas
attempted,
in
a
somewhat
different
manner,
and
arkansas
failed.
so
there
is
no
necessity
to
instruct
the
county.
and
this
court,
in
an
unbroken
line
of
decision
since
chief
justice
marshall,
has
held
that
the
purpose
and
intent
of
intent
of
congress
in
trying
to
accommodate
both
state
and
federal
statutes,
must
look
to
the
intent
and
purpose
of
congress.
there
is
no
doubt
in
this
question
that
congress
is
acting
in
a
field
in
which
it
has
authority.
this
is
land
management,
given
to
it
by
the
constitution,
and
it
also
involves
the
spending
power
of
congress
under
what
conditions
congress
would
impose.
certainly,
the
legislative
history
and,
we
would
submit,
the
act
itself
says
that
its
main
purpose
and
intent
is
to
confer
upon
counties
discretion.
the
south
dakota
statute...
and
indeed
if
it
is
upheld,
other
states
would
follow...
removes
that
discretion,
supplants
the
local
community
where
the
lands
are
located--
mr.
alan
raywid
--well,
first
of
all,
the
county
in
the
year
before
receipt
of
these
funds
tries
to
budget
its
needs.
mr.
alan
raywid
well,
not
necessarily.
and
probably
lawrence
county
certainly
did
not.
it
allocates
the
funds
to
meet
the
budgets
for
the
coming
year.
then,
following
that--
mr.
alan
raywid
--indeed,
it's
instrumental
in--
mr.
alan
raywid
--well,
it
would
have
to
be
using
a
crystal
ball
or
some
kind
of
a
mathematical
formula,
of
which
i'm
not
aware,
in
order
to
find
out
what
the
secretary
of
interior
is
going
to
allocate
for
this
particular
county,
and
find
out
how
that
works
in
the
equation...
which
is
totally
apart
from
the
purpose
and
intent
of
congress.
thank
you.
