mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court,
perhaps
i
could
most
usefully
begin
by
descending
to
particulars.
this
statute,
that
is,
the
federal
statute,
very
pointedly
directs
that
the
payments
be
made
made
to
the
local
government
units,
the
general
government
units
of
the
locality
and
not
to
the
state.
it
would
have
been
much
simpler
for
the
federal
payment
to
be
made
to
the
state
and
to
leave
the
state
free
to
make
the
distribution
as
it
saw
fit.
congress
chose
to
do
otherwise,
and
the
legislative
history
tells
us
why.
there
had
been
an
experience
of
making
payments
to
the
state
with
a
view
to
the
state's
redistributing
the
funds
to
the
affected
locality,
and
all
too
often
the
state
had
failed
to
redistribute
in
the
way
congress
had
expected.
accordingly,
on
this
occasion,
congress
very
clearly
said
we
distrust
the
state.
we
will
pay
directly
to
the
affected
county.
it
is
our
intention
that
they
be
reimbursed
for
the
burdens
our
land
management
imposes
on
them,
and
that
the
money
remain
there.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
it
is
true
that
in
this
instance,
justice
rehnquist,
the
state
statute
did
not
require
the
funds
to
be
expended
outside
the
geographic
area
of
the
county,
but
it
did
require
that
60
percent
of
those
funds
be
allocated
to
a
school
district,
a
school
district
whose
needs
were
in
no
way
increased
by
the
presence
of
federal
land.
on
the
contrary,
the
federal
land
is
forest
land,
for
the
most
part,
which
is--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
--yes.
but
had
that
land
been
taxed,
had
it
been
sold
to
individual,
had
it
been
subject
to
taxation,
presumably
families
would
have
lived
on
it
and
the
school
burden
would
have
been
increased
accordingly.
therefore,
it
would
have
been
appropriate
to
increase
the
allocation
to
the
school
district.
here,
it
is
wholly
inappropriate
to
allocate
60
percent
of
these
federal
funds
which
do
not
merely
stand
in
lieu
of
the
taxes,
but
which
were
intended
to
compensate
for
quite
different
burdens
which
federal
ownership
of
the
land
imposes,
as
distinguished
from
private
ownership
of
that
same
land.
now,
the
point
of
having
the
payments
go
to
the
county
and
not
to
the
state
is
importantly
injured,
if
not
destroyed,
when
the
state
is
free
to
seize
those
monies
as
soon
as
they
reach
the
country
treasury,
and
redistribute
them
as
it
sees
fit.
we
might
as
well
have
given
the
money
directly
to
the
state.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
one
aspect:
if
the
state
had
power
to
allocate
the
money,
it
is
difficult
to
see
why
that
power
was
limited
geographically.
if
you
read
the
statute
as
requiring
the
payment
to
the
county
so
that
the
county
will
have
discretion
as
to
how
to
spend
it,
that
is
one
thing.
if
we
say
that
state
law
can
supplant
the
county's
discretion,
then
why
is
the
state
law
limited
to
redistribution
within
a
geographic
area?
nothing
in
the
statute
would
lead
us
to
that
intermediate
conclusion.
either
the
state
is
ousted,
as
the
dissenting
justices
of
north
dakota
supreme
court
put
it,
but
congress
was
very
clear
that
their
noses
were
not
to
be
intruded
into
this
arrangement
involving
only
supplemental
federal
funds
as
between
the
federal
and
local
governments.
there
is
a...
i'm
sorry.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
there
is
another
aspect
of
this
statute
which
leads
us
in
the
same
direction,
which
is
the
second
part.
justice
rehnquist
quoted
the
provision
of
the
federal
statute
which
says
the
unit
of
local
government
may
use
the
payment
for
any
governmental
purpose.
now
that,
too,
was
no
accident.
previous
federal
statutes
had
earmarked
the
funds.
congress
decided
this
time
we
will
not
do
that.
we
will
not
do
that
because
we
recognize
that
the
needs
vary
from
county
to
county,
from
year
to
year,
and
depending
on
the
kind
of
federal
ownership
involved.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
indeed,
your
honor.
but
it
would
be
strange
for
congress
to
have
withheld
its
hand,
contrary
to
prior
practice,
with
a
few
to
accommodating
the
flexibility
that
is
needed
from
place
to
place,
from
time
to
time,
depending
on
the
kind
of
ownership,
only
to
permit
the
state's
heavy
hand
to
come
down
with
a
uniform
rule
that
destroys
that
flexibility
which
congress
was
anxious
to
create
and
preserve.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
if
that
condition
had
been
announced
in
advance
and
the
state
had
accepted--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
--indeed.
and
your
honor's
analogy
seems
to
me
sound;
that
is,
that
if
the
money
is
accepted
on
those
conditions,
those
conditions
are
enforceable
no
matter
who
the
grantor
may
be.
now,
finally,
as
an
indication
that
this
state
statute
does
offend
the
federal
purpose,
one
looks
to
section
3
of
the
act.
this
case
concerns
section
1
which
involves
the
bulk
of
the
funds,
but
section
3
is
a
special
provision
which
says
in
the
event
a
national
park
or
a
wilderness
is
created
out
of
land
which
was
taxed
just
before
and
which
is
now
removed
from
the
tax
roles,
for
five
years
there
shall
be
a
payment
which
will
substitute
for
the
taxes
which
have
been
lost.
and
there,
congress
directs
that
the
allocation
be
as
the
taxes
were
the
previous
year,
partly
to
the
school
district
and
so
forth.
now,
what
south
dakota
has
done
is
said
we
will
impose
the
section
3
formula
on
section
1
funds,
thereby
destroying
the
whole
point
of
congress's
making
the
difference.
now,
that
is
a
plain
indication
of
how
hostile
these
two
provisions
are.
now,
one
might
wonder
why
the
federal
government
cares,
whether
we're
not
simply
intruding
ourselves
in
a
family
argument
between
a
county
and
a
school
board.
the
government
cares,
first,
because
congress
had
in
mind
benefitting
a
locality
and
not
whatever
agency
of
government
the
state
might
choose
to
benefit.
the
least
populous
counties
probably
have
the
least
voice
in
the
state
legislature
and
therefore
they
are
not
likely
to
failure.
the
government
was
concerned
that
those
who
suffered
the
burden
from
our
presence
be
the
ones
who
benefitted
from
our
funds.
the
government
also,
since
these
funds
were
meant
to
recompense
for
burdens
imposed
by
us,
felt
some
degree
of
duty
to
see
to
it
that
the
funds
were
available
and
used
for
providing
the
services
that
our
lands
required.
and,
duty
aside,
our
self-interest
was
that
the
counties
have
the
funds
available
and
that
they
not
be
deflected
to
the
school
board
or
elsewhere,
but
that
they
be
available
to
furnish
the
services
to
our
lands
which
otherwise
we
would
have
to
contract
and
pay
for
elsewhere.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
it
is
so.
and
congress
had
to
choose
whether
flexibility
or
trust
with
respect
to
the
county
was
most
appropriate.
congress
took
it
that
the
county
could
be
trusted
in
its
special
relationship
with
the
federal
managers
to
expend
at
least
a
measurable
portion
of
those
funds
on
providing
the
services
to
the
federal
lands.
and
let
me
say
in
the
day-to-day
management
of
the
federal
lands,
there
is
a
relationship
between
the
federal
managers
and
the
county
officials.
that
relationship
is
indispensable
to
the
success
of
the
federal
land
program.
it
is
one
which
is
measurably
aided
by
the
presence
of
federal
funds
to
compensate
for
the
burdens
the
government
imposes,
but
it
is
only
useful
if
the
county
is
assured
that
those
funds
are
not
deflected
or
confiscated
or
otherwise
directed
by
the
state
to
be
used
elsewhere.
