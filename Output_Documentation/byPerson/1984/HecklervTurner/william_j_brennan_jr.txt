mr.
phillips,
are
you
going
to
tell
us
the
government's
view
of
the
new
statute?
what
do
we
decide
in
this
case?
justice
jr.
well,
makes
gross
income
certainly
for
the
future,
doesn't
it?
justice
jr.
and
is
there
any
dispute
as
to
the
past?
justice
jr.
back
to
my
initial
question.
why
should
we
be
talking
about
this
case?
justice
jr.
about
what?
justice
jr.
would
it
make
more
sense,
mr.
phillips,
for
us
to
send
this
back?
where
is
it
from?
the
ninth
circuit?
and
tell
them
to
wrestle
with
it
first?
why
should
we?
justice
jr.
well,
even
if
there
isn't,
why
should
we?
why
shouldn't
we
let
them
do
it?
justice
jr.
mr.
aaronson,
i
guess
you
don't
think
that
when
congress
got
around
to
the
'84
act,
perhaps
not
explicitly,
but
at
least
implicitly
congress
suggested
it
did
not
agree
with
the
ninth
circuit's
interpretation.
