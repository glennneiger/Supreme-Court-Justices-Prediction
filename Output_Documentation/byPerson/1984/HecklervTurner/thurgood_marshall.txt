what
is
the
controversy
here?
justice
marshall
just
with
the
new
statute?
justice
marshall
are
you
going
to
get
that
out
of
a
turnip?
justice
marshall
i
guess
i
have
the
feeling
that
we
are
dealing
with
a
hypothetical
case.
justice
marshall
i
don't
think
every
dispute
is
soluble
by
a
court
action.
so
i
still
have
the
feeling
we
are
passing
upon
a
statute
which
has
not
been
litigated.
justice
marshall
which
has
been
replaced
by
the
1984.
justice
marshall
do
you
think
we
should
just
ignore
the
'84
law?
justice
marshall
can
we
take
congress
over
you?
justice
marshall
can
we
take
congress
over
you,
and
send
it
back
to
the
ninth
circuit
to
decide
what
effect,
if
any,
the
'84
act
has
on
this
case?
justice
marshall
there
is
no
difference
between
send
back
and
remand,
is
there?
justice
marshall
i
thought
not.
justice
marshall
have
you
got
a
case
for
me?
justice
marshall
a
case
that
we
can
cite
for
what
you
just
said.
