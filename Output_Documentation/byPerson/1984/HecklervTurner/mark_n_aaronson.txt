mr.
mark
n.
aaronson
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
the
dispute
before
the
court
today
concerns
the
effects
of
what
congress
did
in
1981
or
the
afdc
program.
it
is,
as
the
court
acknowledges,
new
legislation
was
enacted
in
1984,
and
it
is
our
reading
of
that
new
legislation
that
it
evidences
for
the
first
time
a
congressional
intent
supportive
of
the
hhs
secretary's
position.
i
think
the
record
regarding
the
1984
enactment
is
in
sharp
contrast
to
the
record
regarding
1981,
and
we
think
the
prospective
applicability
of
the
1984
enactment
is
one
which
courts
will
have
to
consider,
and
will
have
to
consider
below.
it
is
not
the
dispute
before
this
court.
what
this
court
has
to
weigh
is
any
information
that
can
be
gleaned
from
the
1984
record
about
the
intent
of
congress
in
1981,
but
it
will
not
override
the
intent
of
congress
in
1981
as
this
court
can
determine
from
the
legislative
record
at
that
time
and
the
language
at
that
time.
in
this
regard,
i
think
what
is
very
striking
is
to
look
at
the
reasons
congress
was
given
for
enacting
the
work
expense
disregard
in
1981.
secretary
schweikert,
the
predecessor
to
the
current
secretary,
who
is
the
petitioner
in
this
case,
at
the
hearings
held
before
the
public
assistance
subcommittee
of
the
house
ways
and
means
committee
indicated
that
a
principal
reason
for
the
work
expense
disregard
was
to
provide
an
incentive
for
afdc
recipients
to
find
the
most
economical
way
to
meet
their
work
expenses.
as
we
have
shown
in
our
briefs,
the
average
work
expenses
for
a
working
recipient
in
california
prior
to
the
'81
enactment
was
$83.
a
recipient
working
full-time
at
the
minimum
wage
in
the
typical
afdc
household
would
have
had
withheld
for
payroll
taxes,
the
basic
core
payroll
taxes,
at
least
$75.
if
that
is
the
case,
the
idea
of
having
a
$75
work
expense
disregard
that
would
allow
recipients
to
take
some
measures
to
economize
on
their
expenses
is
a
meaningless
provision.
that
disregard
would
be
eaten
up
entirely
by
the
mandatory
withholdings
over
which
recipients
have
absolutely
no
control.
secondly,
in
terms
of
the
statement
of
reasons
for
this
particular
provision,
not
for
some
of
the
other
provisions
that
were
enacted
during
the
1981
legislative
session,
was
given
by
the
senate
budget
committee.
the
senate
budget
committee
listed
three
reasons,
and
we
have
cited
these
in
our
brief:
one,
that
there
was
great
variation
among
the
states
in
dealing
with
work
expenses.
the
record
in
this
case
is
clear
that
there
was
no
variation
with
respect
to
mandatory
payroll
taxes.
every
state
gave
recipients
a
credit
for
those
expenses,
and
it
did
not
count
against
them
in
determining
their
eligibility
or
benefit
levels.
second,
there
was
a
problem
of
administrative
complexity
and
opportunities
for
error.
there
is
almost
no
problem
of
administrative
complexity
and
opportunity
for
error
with
respect
to
payroll
tax
withholdings.
recipients
must
submit
each
month
their
payroll
stubs,
and
eligibility
workers
and
state
welfare
departments
take
from
those
payroll
stubs
the
exact
amount
of
withholdings
that
an
employer
has
subtracted
from
the
gross
income
of
recipients.
and
third,
there
was
a
concern
for
abuse
by
recipients
in
claiming
work
expenses.
again,
as
the
courts
below
in
this
case
have
indicated,
this
notion
of
withholding
taxes
is
a
paradigmatic
example
of
the
kinds
of
items
that
are
not
subject
to
abuse
and
fraud.
mr.
mark
n.
aaronson
yes,
but
there
is
a
provision
and
have
been
provisions
in
almost
every
state
law.
in
california,
for
example,
recipients
were
required
to
declare
the
number
of
dependents
that
they
actually
have.
they
had
no
option.
it
was
written
as
part
of
the
administrative
regulation
governing
the
calculation
of
grants,
so
that--
mr.
mark
n.
aaronson
--it
is
subject
to
very
easy
verification.
you
get
on
afdc
because
you
have
children
eligible
for
the
grant.
your
dependents
are
going
to
typically
be
your
children
and
yourself.
if
it
happens
to
be
a
two-parent
household,
there
will
be
four
parents.
it
is
really
very
easy
to
verify.
there
was
an
absolute
requirement
that
recipients
not
have
any
opportunity
to
vary,
take
advantage
of
the
tax
laws,
if
you
will,
and
declare
either
fewer
or
more
dependents.
mr.
mark
n.
aaronson
not
in
this
case.
this
provision...
the
afdc
households
would
be
governed
in
terms
of
declaring
dependents
for
afdc
purposes
by
the
number
of
dependents
they
actually
have.
now,
i
think
the
purpose
behind
the
work
expense
disregard
is
illustrated
by
one
of
our
class
representatives
in
this
case,
ms.
kathryn
bass.
she
had
each
month
$84
of
withholding
taxes
taken
from
her
paycheck.
she
also
declared,
not
counting
her
child
care
expenses,
$180
in
cut
of
pocket
work
expenses.
under
the
new
provision,
she
is
forced
to
economize
on
those
$180
in
work
expenses,
and
will
have
to
get
them
down
to
$75.
that
is
what
the
new
law
required
of
her.
in
terms
of
directly
addressing,
if
one
looks
in
the
legislative
record,
and
looks
at
statements
of
officials
or
congressional
representatives,
there
is
absolutely
no
reference
to
taxes
at
all
in
the
1981
legislation.
there
appeared
to
be
no
concern,
no
focus
by
congress
on
this
particular
issue.
this
comes
up
as
an
issue
precisely
after
litigation
is
brought
challenging
the
federal
government's
interpretation
of
this
provision,
and
the
1984
enactment
is
enacted
in
response
to
hhs
bringing
that
litigation
to
the
attention
of
congress,
and
it
is,
i
think,
striking
to
compare
congress's
attention
to
this
issue
in
1984
with
its
total
lack
of
attention
to
the
issue
in
1981.
now,
the
real
heart
of
the
problem
in
this
case
is
an
historical
interpretation
that
has
been
endorsed
by
this
court,
that
has
been
ratified
by
congress
on
several
occasions,
of
the
meaning
of
what
is
termed
the
income
and
resources
clause
of
section
402(a)(7)(a).
that
is
at
the
very
first
part
of
that
section
of
the
social
security
act,
and
it
has
not
been
amended
since
its
original
enactment
in
any
significant
way
in
1939.
it
was
reenacted
in
1962,
when
congress
first
enacted
a
mandatory
work
expense
provision
to
take
into
account
the
problems
of
out
of
pocket
work
expenses.
it
was
reenacted
in
1967-68,
when
congress
again
amended
these
provisions,
and
it
was
reenacted
even
a
third
time
in
1981,
again,
without
modification,
and
it
is
that
provision
which
the
lower
courts
have
relied
on
and
the
long-standing
administrative
interpretation,
legislatively
and
judicially
endorsed
interpretation
that
that
provision
requires
recipients
only
to
take
into
account
what
is
called
actually
available
income.
and
we
have
submitted
in
the
record,
and
you
will
find
in
the
joint
appendix
the
1940's
social
security
board
statements
which
require
the
states
in
administering
the
afdc
program
at
that
time
consistent
with
the
intent
of
congress
as
expressed
in
1939
to
take
into
account
only
income
that
is
in
hand,
that
is
readily
available.
that
particular...
those
particular
statements
are
the
predecessors
of
the
current
afdc
provision
in
the
regulations
that
requires
that
only
income
actually
available
be
taken
into
account.
in
1962,
when
congress
enacted
the
reasonable
expense
provision,
the
secretary
contends
that
that
was
also
intended
to
cover
mandatory
tax
withholdings.
it
is
again,
as
in
1981,
striking
that
there
is
absolutely
no
reference
whatsoever
in
the
1962
legislative
record,
in
the
administrative
guidelines
that
were
proposed
before,
in
the
implementing
administrative
regulations
that
were
enacted
after
that
in
any
way
referenced
tax
withholding.
hew
and
congress
in
1962
was
dealing
with
the
problem
that
states
were
not
consistently.
they
were
urged.
it
was
optional
for
them.
they
were
not
consistently
taking
into
account
the
out
of
pocket
expenses
individuals
have
for
transportation,
for
lunches,
for
meals.
they
in
no
way
were
talking
about
taxes.
it
just
hasn't
come
up
as
an
issue.
it
is
also
evidence,
as
we
have
submitted
in
the
record
and
you
will
find
in
your
joint
appendix,
that
prior
to
that
enactment,
hew
commissioned
a
report,
and
that
report
very
clearly
says
that
the
states
were
considering
as
the
income
available
to
the
household
if
there
were
earners
in
the
household
their
take-home
pay
as
the
starting
point,
and
from
their
take-home
pay
they
then
urged
the
states
on
an
optional
basis
to
subtract
the
kind
of
discretionary
expenses.
congress
knows
how,
congress
knows
how
to
make
exceptions
to
the
actually
available
income
principle.
they
did
it
in
1981.
they
did
it
on
behalf
of
income
from
stepfathers
that
were
residing
in
afdc
homes,
thereby
superceding
in
terms
of
the
precise
issue
a
case
of
this
court,
lewis
v.
martin.
they
also
deemed
available
moneys
from
the
earned
income
tax
credit,
an
action
they
undid
in
1984,
and
they
also
deemed
available
very
explicitly
actions
from
sponsors
of
aliens
who
might
have
come
here
as
being
moneys
available.
prior
to
the
1981
legislation,
congress
had
a
number
of
bills
concerning
this
precise
issue,
work
expenses,
and
also
the
problem
which
is
not
part
of
this
case,
of
the
computation
of
the
work
incentive
disregard.
a
very
important
bill
was
h.r.
4904.
in
that
bill,
they
did
something
very
specific
that
was
not
done
in
1981.
they
amended
the
definition
of
income
in
the
income
and
resources
clause.
they
in
fact
repealed
the
notion
of
actually
available
income
and
very
specifically
in
the
statute
qualified
the
definition
of
income
by
reference
to
another
provision
that
very
carefully
listed
what
income
was
to
be
included
and
what
income
was
to
be
excluded.
they
then
established,
as
part
of
section
402(a),
a
set
of
disregards
that
were
more
liberal
than
those
finally
enacted,
and
that
were
intended
to
roughly
keep
recipients
in
the
same
place
as
they
had
been
before
in
terms
of
the
subtraction
of
various
deductions
and
out
of
pocket
expenses
and
also
continue
to
provide
for
the
kind
of
work
incentive
disregard
that
existed
before.
congress
knows
how.
it
showed
again,
not
as
directly,
i
must
say,
but
i
think
there
certainly
is
evidence
in
the
congressional
reports
in
1984
that
it
can
create
an
exception,
but
our
contention
has
been,
and
i
think
one
fully
supported
and
very
well
reasoned
by
the
courts
below
that
they
did
not
do
that
in
1981.
they
were
not
concerned
with
this
particular
issue.
now,
we
have
raised
in
our
briefing
the
question
of
whether
given
the
1984
legislation
this
should
be
a
case
before
this
court,
not
because
the
1984
provision
applies
retrospectively.
i
do
not
think
that
is
the
case
at
all.
but
that
it
now
does
provide
prospectively,
and
our
assumption
has
been
that
the
court
accepted
the
cert
petition
in
this
case
because
there
was
a
conflict
among
the
circuits,
and
there
was
likely
to
continue
to
be
a
conflict
among
the
circuits.
mr.
mark
n.
aaronson
that
would
be
our
position,
that
that
is
just...
you
know,
in
balancing
all
the
various
considerations,
that
if
in
fact
congress
had
enacted
the
1984
legislation
before
this
court
had
accepted
the
cert
petition,
i
think
it
would
have
been
an
important
question
for
the
court
to
consider.
and
it
may
well
not
have
reached
the
same
conclusion
that
it
did
reach
when
it
was
presented
with
a
case
where
it
was
a
continuing
vital
issue.
mr.
mark
n.
aaronson
it
would
trouble
me,
just
as
it
troubles
me
that
in
many
parts
of
the
country
there
never
were
any
challenges
presented
to
this
provision
at
all,
and
in
fact
there
has
been
over
a
period
of
time
a
differential
implementation,
and
even
if
this
court
were
to
rule
in
this
case,
in
order
for
that
judgment
to
be
enforced
throughout
the
country,
there
would
have
to
be
individual
actions
brought.
and
in
this
particular
case,
given
this
court's
holding
in
edelman
v.
jordan,
in
state
courts,
in
all
likelihood,
in
the
50
states
one
would
have
to
bring
this
particular
action
in
order
to
enforce
retroactively
the
decision
if
this
court
were
to
rule
in
favor
of
recipients.
so,
in
terms
of
there
being
a
difference,
a
difference
exists
as
a
matter
of
practice.
i
am
not
happy
with
it.
i
think
the
ninth
circuit
was
right,
and
that
the
other
circuits
are
wrong,
that
the
reasoning--
mr.
mark
n.
aaronson
--it
would
trouble
me,
and
i
would
then
have
to
weigh
whether
i
thought
it
was
better
to
reach
the
case
on
the
merits,
and
i
think
if
that
were
the
case,
i
think
the
ninth
circuit
decision
should
be
upheld
in
this
case.
there
still
will
be
problems
as
a
practical
matter
in
implementing
that
everywhere.
if
you
were
to
affirm
the
ninth
circuit,
it
doesn't
end
the
matter
in
terms
of
the
differentiation
in
treatment.
that
is
the
point.
mr.
mark
n.
aaronson
i
think
in
terms
of
resolving
this
particular
issue,
unless
you
think
that
the
very
summary
statements
made
in
'84
override
what
we
find
to
be
the
intent
of
congress
in
'81
and
the
intent
of
prior
congresses--
mr.
mark
n.
aaronson
--excuse
me?
mr.
mark
n.
aaronson
i
certainly
think
that
is
an
alternative
for
the
court.
the
court
could
simply
remand
to
the
ninth
circuit.
i
think
it
would
be--
mr.
mark
n.
aaronson
--no,
there
is
not.
mr.
mark
n.
aaronson
no,
i
think
that
is
an
alternative.
i
think
the
better
alternative
is
to
affirm,
or
if
you
think
it
is
not
an
issue
the
court
really
should
get
involved
in
at
this
point,
to
dismiss
the
writ
and
just
end
the
matter.
mr.
mark
n.
aaronson
there
is
no
statement
in
the
act
at
all
that
that--
mr.
mark
n.
aaronson
--your
honor,
i
am
not
familiar
with
the
law
that
would
say
the
presumption
is
the
other
way.
in
briefing
the
issue,
i
assume
the
question
would--
mr.
mark
n.
aaronson
--no.
i
don't
think
the
secretary
was--
mr.
mark
n.
aaronson
--i
don't
think
the
record...
now,
we
again
haven't
gotten
fully
into
it.
the
1984
legislation
is
a
case
of
first
impression
here.
but
i
think
the
secretary
was
not
free
to
interpret
the
statute
in
an
impermissible
way.
our
argument
is,
that
is
the
case
between
1981
and
1984,
and
i
don't
think
the
record
on
1984
indicates
that
congress
was
ratifying
the
secretary's
interpretation
retroactively.
i
think
it
was
indicating
for
the
first
time
that
it
was
intending
to
create
an
exception
for
earned
income
from
the
principle
of
actually
available
income,
an
exception
that
never
took
place
before.
the
secretary
has
never
been
able
to
point
to
when
in
time
this
kind
of
miraculous
exception
was
created
for
section
402(a)(8).
mr.
mark
n.
aaronson
if
congress
was
doing
that,
it
was
in
direct
conflict
with
what
prior
congresses
had
done
in
1939
and
1968.
mr.
mark
n.
aaronson
well,
i
am
more
familiar
with
california
state
law,
where
in
fact
certain
statutes
might
be
applied
retroactively,
more
in
the
land
use
area.
you
have
me
on
a
certain
point
that
i
am
not
directly
familiar
with.
and
that
only
occurs
when
there
is
a
vesting
of
rights.
and
if
i
were
to
draw
an
analogy
to
this
kind
of
case,
i
think
there
has
been
a
vesting
of
rights
in
these
recipients,
and
it
would
be
an
injustice,
and
i
suspect
i
could
find
cases
to
show
incorrect
legally
to
apply
this
statute
on
its
face
without
any
more
comment
from
congress
than
what
one
finds
in
a
very
brief
section
of
a
1,000-page
piece
of
legislation
concerning
the
budget
reconciliation
process.
this
was
not
careful
deliberation
by
congress
in
'84,
and
it
was
not
extensive
deliberation,
given
all
the
other
matters
that
were
before
congress
in
1981.
and
i
think
it
is
incumbent
to
look
very
clearly
about
what
was
done
to
try
when
you
have
a
statute
like
this
that
has
to
be
viewed
in
terms
of
a
series
amendments
taking
place
over
time,
where
congress
at
various
times
had
different
objectives.
and
i
think
the
duty
of
this
court,
as
it
was
the
duty
of
the
courts
below,
is
to
reconcile
what
in
a
program
as
complicated
as
the
afdc
program
often
one
finds
competing
kinds
of
considerations
and
potentially
conflicting
policies.
mr.
mark
n.
aaronson
i
think
it
certainly
made
a
different...
you
could
argue
certainly
implicitly
they
made
a
different
policy
choice.
there
is
clear
and
manifest
intent
that
congress
was
addressing
the
issue
and
was
making
a
policy
choice.
there
is
not
a
clear
and
manifest
intent
expressed
in
the
1981
legislation.
mr.
mark
n.
aaronson
i
think
in
'84.
that
is
what
i
say.
the
difficulty
is,
they
didn't
directly
amend
section
402(a)(7),
but
they
added
a
new
section
to
section
402(a)(8),
read
in
conjunction
with
the
legislative
report,
i
think,
can
be
shown
to
have
for
the
first
time
evidenced
their
intent
to
create
an
exception.
now,
i
think
what
was
really
going
on
in
1981,
and
what
was
of
primary
concern
to
congress
was
ending
certain
financial
incentives
that
existed
for
working
recipients,
and
those
have
to
do
with
this
work
incentive
disregard
that
is
not
at
issue
in
this
case,
and
reversing
how
it
is
computed,
fixing
certain
limits
on
its
availability
to
four
months.
they
were
also
concerned
about
certain
high
earners
being
on
welfare,
so
they
established
a
flat
amount,
a
flat
limit
on
eligibility,
what
is
called
the
150
percent
rule.
they
were
concerned
about
the
higher
earners
being
on
welfare.
what
they
were
not
concerned,
what
they
didn't
express
other
than
in
a
general
concern
for
simplifying
administration
and
dealing
with
a
certain
problem
of
abuse,
was
to
put
recipients
in
a
worse
position
because
they
are
working.
and
the
interpretation
of
the
1981
provision
does
precisely
that.
in
1984,
congress
enacted
some
provisions
that
modified
the
harshness
of
that
impact
at
the
same
time
they
enacted
the
definition
of
earned
income,
so
that
the
provision
operating
prospectively
will
not
be
as
harsh
on
working
recipients
as
it
is
in
the
past.
in
essence,
what
the
congress
was
doing
in
1981
with
respect
to
this
issue
was
superseding
this
court's
decision
in
shea
versus
vialpando.
shea
did
not
address
the
mandatory
payroll
deduction
issue
at
all.
what
was
at
issue
was
colorado's
provision
for
applying
a
flat
$30
work
expense
disregard
for
transportation
and
other
out
of
pocket
expenses.
it
didn't
cover
child
care.
it
didn't
cover
tax
withholdings.
this
court
did
not
address
the
statutory
basis
on
which
states
may
have
been
taking
into
account
individually
tax
withholdings.
in
1981,
congress
enacts
the
$75
work
expense
disregard.
they
enact
a
separate
provision
for
child
care,
and
they
don't
address
taxes
at
all.
what
congress
was
doing
is
saying
what
this
court
said
it
could
not
do
under
the
1962
legislation.
they
are
saying
you
can't
establish
an
absolute
limit,
have
an
absolute
standard
on
work
expenses.
basically,
what
has
happened
in
this
case,
after
congress
enacted,
without
the
hhs
secretary
in
any
way
informing
congress
ahead
of
time,
at
least
from
what
is
evident
in
the
record
that
one
can
find,
the
hhs
secretary
decided
to
bootstrap
the
notion
of
including
mandatory
payroll
taxes
within
$75
work
expense
disregard.
and
what
one
sees
afterwards
and
one
sees
in
the
briefs
is
a
post
facto
rationalization
of
that
administrative
decision
by
hhs,
an
administrative
decision
that
is
impermissible,
that
involves
an
impermissible
construction
at
the
time
of
section
402(a)(7)(a)
because
it
would
result
in
a
conflict
with
the
over
40-year
history
of
using
only
actually
available
income.
unless
the
court
has
questions
for
me,
i
am
prepared
to
sit
down.
