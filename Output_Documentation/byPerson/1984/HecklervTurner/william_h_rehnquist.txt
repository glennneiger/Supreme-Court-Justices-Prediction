justice
rehnquist
usually
there
is
a
presumption
that
the
court
applies
the
law
in
effect
when
the
case
is
still
open,
the
final
version
of
the
law
that
is
in
effect.
justice
rehnquist
you
say
because
there
is
a
possibility
of
unfairness
to
individual
claimants
that
you
have
some
reservation
about
applying
the
traditional
rule
that
you
decide
a
case
that
is
still
alive
by
the
most
recent
congressional
enactment,
but
then
as
i
understand
it
what
you
say
is
that
putting
entirely
aside
the
1984
ratification
that
has
been
referred
to,
properly
analyzing
the
legal
materials
available
before
1984,
the
court
of
appeals
should
be
reversed
because
they
were
wrong
on
the
preexisting
law.
justice
rehnquist
but
if
we
accept
your
submission
that
perhaps
the
writ
should
be
dismissed
or
the
case
simply
remanded
to
the
ninth
circuit,
then
what
about
the
cases
from
the
various
other
courts
of
appeals
that
have
come
out
the
other
way?
would
it
be
your
submission
that
given
the
fact
it
is
no
longer
a
live
issue,
that
is
a
tolerable
conflict?
justice
rehnquist
it
wouldn't
trouble
you,
then,
that
afdc
recipients
in
one
part
of
the
country
had
been
found
to
be
entitled
to
certain
amounts
and
the
same
recipients
similarly
situated
in
other
parts
of
the
country
had
been
found
not
entitled
to
them?
justice
rehnquist
but
just
from
the
point
of
view
of
judicial
administration,
supposing
you
were
totally
neutral
as
to
how
this
particular
issue
should
be
resolved.
wouldn't
it
trouble
you
some
to
think
that,
you
know,
identically
situated
people
in
north
carolina
and
alabama
were
treated
differently
than
identically
situated
people
in
california
and
nevada?
justice
rehnquist
well,
you
say
then
that
the
'84
act
is
not
a
ratification
of
the...
in
the
sense
of
agency
law,
that
in
order
to
ratify
it
must
have
been
within
the
authority
of
the
agent
prior
to
the
ratification?
