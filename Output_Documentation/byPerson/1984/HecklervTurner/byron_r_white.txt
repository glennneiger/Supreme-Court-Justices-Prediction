justice
white
why
shouldn't
we
just
apply
the
statutory
law
the
way
it
is
now?
the
case
isn't
final
yet.
isn't
the
usual
rule
we
just
apply
the
law
as
it
presently
stands
until
the
case
is
over?
justice
white
well,
i
know,
but
why
aren't
you
making
that
argument?
justice
white
they
didn't
say
it
was
prospective,
did
they?
justice
white
--if
you
apply
the
statute
as
it
is
amended,
it
is
not
much
of
a
struggle,
is
it?
justice
white
well,
they
didn't
just
apply
it
to
cases
that
are
still
to
come.
justice
white
well,
i
don't
know.
that's
the
current
law,
and
the--
justice
white
--isn't
that
a
standard
rule?
justice
white
you
mean
applying
it
to
this
case?
you
have
no
objection
to
applying
it
to
this--
justice
white
what
do
you
mean
by
that,
ratify?
justice
white
i
think
your
position
ends
up
being
that
you
apply
the
current
law.
justice
white
well,
i
think
it
is.
justice
white
you
say
the
secretary
has
just
ratified.
well,
assume
that
we
would
interpret
the
law
differently
before
the
so-called
ratification.
then
what
the
congress
has
done
is
amend
it.
justice
white
it
sounds
to
me
like
you
are
just
suggesting
we
unnecessarily
decide
what
the
law
meant
before
this
new
statute.
justice
white
well,
you
think
it
should
do.
you
say
it
ratified.
justice
white
what
makes
you
think
congress
didn't
intend
the
statute
to
affect
a
case
like
this?
justice
white
the
presumption
is
the
other
way.
justice
white
do
you
think
that
the...
you
don't
agree
with
the
united
states,
then,
that
congress
intended
to
ratify
the
secretary's
interpretation
of
the
act?
justice
white
because
if
we
read
the
legislative
history
and
the
statute,
whatever
other
evidence
there
is,
and
thought
that
the
congress
really
did
intend
to
ratify,
in
those
words,
using
that
word,
the
prior
interpretation
by
the
secretary,
then
you
certainly
would
be
led
to
believe
they
thought
the
act
ought
to...
that
that
view
ought
to
govern
cases
like
this.
justice
white
but
even
if
it
was
an
amendment,
your
sole
reliance
for
nonretroactivity
is
unless
congress
indicated
it
should
be
applied
retroactively,
it
shouldn't
be
applied
retroactively.
is
that
your
view?
