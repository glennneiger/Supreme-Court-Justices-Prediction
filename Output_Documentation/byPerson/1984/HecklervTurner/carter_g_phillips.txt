mr.
carter
g.
phillips
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
this
case
concerns
the
proper
interpretation
of
section
402(a)(7)
and
(8)
of
the
social
security
act,
which
is
a
provision
in
the
aid
to
families
with
dependent
children
statute.
specifically
at
issue
is
the
proper
way
to
treat
mandatory
payroll
withholdings
from
salary,
primarily
income
taxes,
in
determining
a
working
afdc
recipient's
eligibility
for
or
level
of
benefits.
although
the
afdc
scheme
is
no
stranger
to
this
court,
in
order
to
understand
the
narrow
legal
issue
involved
here,
a
brief
statutory
history
may
be
helpful.
as
this
court
has
recognized,
the
statute
basically
embodies
the
notion
of
cooperative
federalism.
the
state
determines
the
level
of
need,
and
determines
the
level
of
benefits.
but
in
providing
those
kinds
of
benefits
to
afdc
recipients,
the
state
is
obliged
to
comply
with
a
variety
of
requirements
embodied
in
section
402
of
the
statue.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
new
statute
has
ratified
the
secretary's
interpretation
of
the
1981--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--yes,
your
honor,
and
i
think
it--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--i
think...
well,
there
is
no
dispute
in
my
mind
that
the
congress
recognized
that
the
secretary's
interpretation
of
the
structure
of
the
statute
has
always
been
correct
from
1981
through
1984.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
there
is
still
a
substantial
amount
of
controversy
with
regard
to
the
period--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--subsequent
to
the
enactment
in
1981,
and
before
the
injunction
was
issued
in
this
case,
there
is
a
claim
for
retroactive
benefits
by
state
afdc
recipients
in
california.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
i
don't
know
that
that...
well,
that
would
be
perfectly
satisfactory
to
us,
your
honor.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
it
seemed
to
us
somewhat
unfair
to
deprive
individuals
of
their
rights.
in
fact,
congress
had
changed
the
statute,
and
had
intended
to
do
so
prospectively.
in
our
view,
congress
meant
to
do
it
retrospectively,
and
therefore
it
is
not
an
issue.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
no,
your
honor,
they
did
not.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
yes,
justice
rehnquist,
that
is
correct.
and
we
would
be
perfectly
content
to
stand
on
that,
but
we
do
think
that
there
is
still
an
issue
with
regard--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--well,
i
don't
believe
that
there
is
nearly
so
much
to
wrestle
with
any
longer.
congress
has
made
quite
plain--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--well,
the
reason
the
agency
has
asked
to
have
you
do
that
is
because
we
have
a
substantial
number
of
these
cases
pending
in
various
circuits.
this
case
is
presently
before
the
court
ready
for
final
disposition--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--and
will
remove...
it
will
presumably
save
the
court
a
tremendous
burden,
and
the
lower
courts.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
it
is
not
a
struggle
at
all
in
my
mind.
i
think
justice
rehnquist's
order
lifting
the
injunction
made
clear
that
effective
july
18th,
congress
has
unambiguously
ordered
the
secretary
to--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--nothing
in
the
statute...
well,
i
mean,
the
statute
became
effective
july
18th.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
as
i
say,
we
have
no
quarrel
with
the
court's
adopting
that
approach
in
this
case,
because
it
seems
quite
clear
what
the
result
is.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
yes,
justice
rehnquist.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
we
don't
have
any
objection
to
the
standard
rule
or
to
applying
it
in
this
specific
case.
to
return
to
the
statutory
background,
the
congress
has
since
the
1940's
required
that
in
determining
the
level
of
benefits
that
should
be
afforded
to
recipients,
that
those
recipients
who
work
should
have
their
income
counted
against
those
benefits,
and
since
1962,
congress
has
also
recognized
that
working
afdc
recipients
incur
unique
expenses
which
also
should
be
taken
into
consideration.
in
section
402(a)(7)
of
the...
as
adopted
in
1962
provides
that
the
states
must
deduct
expenses
reasonably
attributable
to
the
earning
of
income.
in
1981,
congress
removed
that
portion
of
section
402(a)(7)
and
substituted
in
its
place
in
402(a)(8)
a
standardized
deduction,
which
as
the
senate
report
explained,
was
in
list
of
work
expenses.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
we
did
not
make
that
argument
in
our
reply
brief.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
i
will
frankly
concede
that
it
seems
somewhat
unfair
to
individuals
within
the
afdc
recipients'
position
to
have
the
statute
done
that
way,
and
given
the
absence
of
any
indication
that
congress
intended
to
apply
it
retrospectively.
i
recognize
the
presumption
is
the
other
way,
but
in
a
case
where
congress
says
the
statute
goes
into
effect
prospectively,
it
is
a
little
difficult.
in
this
instance,
since
it
makes
no
difference,
it
is
quite
clear
that
congress
intended
by
the
'84
act
to
ratify
the
secretary's
interpretation,
and
it
seems
to
me
there
is
no
theoretical
importance--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--yes.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
i
think
that's
correct.
i
mean,
there
is
no
question
that
there
is
at
least
some
doubt
as
to
how
the
ninth
circuit
would
handle
this
particular
issue,
and
so
it
seems
it
certainly
would
be
more
efficient
in
use
of
judicial
resources
for
the
court
to
decide
the
case,
since
it
is
presently
here
and
ready
for
disposition.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
in
the
specific
case
here,
we
would
have
a
right
to
recoup
any
of
the
moneys
given
out
when
the
injunction...
that
were
overpaid
because
of
the
injunction
of
the
district
court.
we
would,
both
the
state
of
california
and
hhs
would
have
the
right
to
go
against
those
recipients
and
reacquire
the
benefits
that
we
had
overpaid.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
yes,
your
honor,
that
is
with
the
new
statute.
under
the
old
statute,
we
still
have
the
right.
we
also
have
it
in
our
discretion
not
to
go
after
those
claims,
but
we
certainly--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--but
a
disposition
of
this
case
would
resolve
it.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
we
are
not
so
presumptuous,
i
suppose,
to
have
assumed
that
we
would
necessarily
win
so
that
we
would
have
implemented
a
plan
to
go
after
those
resources
at
this
stage.
i
have
been
informed
by
the
state
agency
that
it
is
seriously
considering
at
least
doing
it
to
a
certain
extent
on
the
theory
that
if
recipients
realize
that
they
can
have
overpayments
recouped
against
them,
they
might
well
think
a
second
time
before
chasing
out
after
statutory
schemes.
there
is
at
least
some
possibility
that
they
may
do
that,
but
there
is
obviously
no...
it
is
not
compelled.
the
agency
need
not
do
that.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
under
the
injunction
between...
it
is
in
tens
of
millions
of
dollars.
that
much
i
know.
precisely
how
much
it
is,
i
don't
know,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
everyone
recognizes
that
it
will
be
difficult,
which
may
well
be
why
it
won't
be
requested,
but
on
the
other
hand,
there
may
be
some
individual
recipients
who
are
in
a
better
position
to
reimburse
us.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
but
it
is
not
a
hypothetical
case,
justice
marshall.
there
is
a
dispute
involved
here.
we
have
rights
at
stake.
whether
we
choose
to
ultimately
implement
those
rights
do
not
undermine
the
existence
of
the
rights
in
the
first
instance.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
there
is
no
question
that
the
1984...
we
don't
require
the
1984
statute
for
these
purposes.
we
are
perfectly
content
to
rely
on
the
1981
statute
as
the
basis
for
overturning
the
ninth
circuit.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
there
is
no
question
that
prospectively,
or
at
least
i
gather
from
the
way
the
questions
are
going
that
there
is
no
question
that
prospectively
this
case
is
at
an
end,
but
that
still
doesn't
in
any
way
diminish
the
fact
that
retrospectively
there
is
still
at
least
some
issue,
although,
as
we
argue
at
some
length,
in
our
view
the
1984
act
does
no
more
than
ratify
what
the
preexisting
law
was.
respondents
are
a
class
of
working
afdc
recipients.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
as
i...
the
way
that
the
secretary
interpreted--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--retrospectively.
well--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--when
we
get
there--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--if
you
were
to
take
that
position,
but
that
is
not...
i
mean,
as
we
understood
the
legislative
history
of
the
1984
amendments,
what
they
said
was
that
they
were
verifying
the
law
to
endorse
the
secretary's
preexisting
interpretation,
and
that
they
had
acted
in
1981
in
cutting
the
way
they
had
with
the
projections
in
mind
as
the
secretary
had
created
them.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
unless...
if
you
are
going
to
take
the
view
that
the
1984
statute
is
the
one
in
effect
and
that
should
resolve
the
claims
that
exist--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--well,
i
think
there
is
no
reason
to
decide
what
congress
really
specifically
intended
with
respect
to
prospective
or
retrospective
effect
of
the
new
provision.
what
we
say
is
that
the
technical
clarification
ratified
the
preexisting
law
in
any
event.
so
it
is
just
simply...
we
come
to
the
same
conclusion,
just
simply
through
two
different
routes,
justice
white.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
to
return
for
a
moment
to
the
1981
statute
and
why
it
is
we
believe...
and
why
the
secretary
concluded
that
the
mandatory
withholdings
must
be
included
within
the
$75
cap,
congress
did
two
things.
first,
it
removed
the
reasonably
attributable
work
expenses
provision
in
402(a)(7).
prior
to
1981,
this
court
had
decided
in
shea
versus
vialpando
that
that
provision
referred
to
all
expenses,
subject
only
to
a
reasonableness
limitation
that
could
be
attributable
to
income.
every
state
recognized
that
those
expenses
would
also
include
mandatory
payroll
withholdings.
when
congress
took
that
provision
and
added
it
to
402(a)(8),
the
inference
seems
to
me
inescapable
that
congress
intended
to
include
the
mandatory
withholdings
within
that
provision.
but
any
doubt
on
that
question
seems
to
me
to
have
been
resolved
because
congress
added
the
work
disregard
to
earned
income,
and
earned
income
also
had
been
well
established
prior
to
the
1981
enactment
as
meaning
gross
wages,
and
therefore
congress
called
for
the
disregard
to
come
from
gross
wages.
accordingly,
the
two,
the
combination
of
the
treatment
of
402(a)(7)
and
402(a)(9)
seems
to
me
clearly
to
require
the
conclusion
that
mandatory
withholdings
must
be
within
the...
were
always
intended
in
1981
as
within
the
mandatory...
or
within
the
$75
disregard.
that
also
comports
well
with
the
policy
of
the
1981
amendments.
first
congress
intended
to
standardize
this
process
to
avoid
any
kind
of
arithmetical
errors
or
potential
abuse,
and
clearly
a
$75
standard
disregard
eliminates
any
kind
of
problems
that
might
otherwise
arise
in
case
of
handling
specific
individualized
tax
items.
congress
eliminated
that
by
including
only
$75
as
the
cap.
in
addition,
congress
meant
to
save
some
money
by
including
a
$75
cap
that
was
below
the
national
average.
in
order
to
assure
that
work
expenses
are
below
the
national
average
of
$75,
one
has
to
include
mandatory
payroll
withholding.
that
is
the
force
of
the
mcmann
affidavit.
if
you
exclude
those
mandatory
withholdings,
then
the
national
average
drops
below
$75,
which
would
mean
that
this
provision
was
in
effect
a
bonus
for
the
recipients
instead
of
a
cut,
as
congress
clearly
intended.
thus
in
our
view
there
is
no
way
to
read
the
action
of
the
congress
in
1981
in
terms
of
its
statutory
history
and
in
terms
of
its
policy
of
the
act
in
any
way
but
to
endorse
the
secretary's
interpretation.
for
reasons
that
i
think
are
even
clearer,
and
that
i
have
already
discussed,
the
1984
amendments
essentially
ratified
the
secretary's
interpretation.
there
is
a
live
controversy
as
to
that,
and
that
issue
then
can
be
disposed
of
readily,
and
we
ask
the
court
to
do
so.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
justice
rehnquist
issued
a
stay.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
that's
correct,
that's
correct,
both
from
the
time
of
the
issuance
of
the
stay
and
for
the
time
prior
to
the
issuance
of
the
original
permanent
injunction.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
and
its
enactment.
so
that
is
still
in
effect.
moreover,
if
you
were
to
dismiss
the
writ
as
improvidently
granted,
we
have
the
additional
problem
of
the
petitioners
from
the
other
states
where
the
courts
of
appeals
had
rejected
the
ninth
circuit's
interpretation
who
are
also
before
this
court,
and
those
cases
would
have
to
be
resolved
independently,
too.
if
there
are
no
questions,
then
i
would
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
yes,
mr.
chief
justice,
just
a
couple
of
points.
basically,
we
would
like
to
make
two
points.
one,
in
response
to
respondent's
contention
concerning
the
actually
available
income
principle,
and
then
second,
i
would
like
to
make
a
few
comments
concerning
the
1984
legislation.
respondents
contend
that
this
court
should
basically
disregard
everything
that
congress
had
before
it
in
1981
when
it
amended
sections
402(a)(7)
and
(8),
and
instead
think
back
into
the
1940's
and
1950's
to
practices
that
were
never
part
of
any
of
the
statute
or
the
regulations
that
would
expressly
incorporate
the
kind
of
actually
available
income
doctrine
that
respondents
argue
for.
respondents
basically
say
that
actually
available
income
must
refer
to
take-home
pay.
congress
has
never
defined
income
to
refer
to
take-home
pay.
no
legislative
history
of
congress
has
ever
defined
income
to
refer
to
take-home
pay.
no
regulations
or
instructions
of
either
hew
or
hhs
has
ever
referred
to
income
as
take-home
pay.
indeed,
the
ninth
circuit
in
this
case
did
not
even
adopt
the
theory
that
income
is
take-home
pay.
it
recognized
that
some
withholdings
could
properly
be
included
within
the
standard
disregard.
there
is
simply
no
authoritative
source
for
the
notion
that
actually
available
income
is
take-home
pay.
what
is
much
more
reasonable
to
conclude
is
that
this
is
in
fact
actually
available
income.
it
is
moneys
paid
directly
from
the
employer
to
the
employee,
and
are
immediately
used
for
certain
expenses
that
the
employee
must
incur
by
virtue
of
having
worked,
and
that
is
exactly
what
work
expense
disregards
would
presumably
embrace.
accordingly,
in
our
view,
the
actually
available
income
concept
is
simply
too
weak
to
sustain
the
burden
of
respondent's
submission
in
this
case,
especially
in
light
of
the
notion
that
congress
had
a
different
administrative
practice
to
which
it
was
responding.
with
regard
to
the
effect
of
the
1984
legislation,
it
seems
to
me
respondents
suggested
a
couple
of
alternatives.
the
worst
of
those
is
that
the
court
should
dismiss
the
writ
as
improvidently
granted.
in
that
event,
the
state
will
immediately
become
liable
for
$20
million
in
retroactive
benefits
prior
to
the
time
of
the
permanent
injunction.
moreover,
presumably
the
injunction
of
the
district
court
will
now
be
reinstated
in
that
event,
and
therefore
prospectively
the
statute
will
now
be
interpreted
in
a
way
consistent
with
respondent's
theory.
it
makes
no
sense
to
force
hhs
and
the
state
to
incur
those
kinds
of
liabilities
in
a
situation
where
the
ninth
circuit's
decision
is
manifestly
inconsistent
with
congress's
intent,
certainly
in
1984,
and
under
our
theory
in
1981.
the
alternative,
of
course,
is
to
simply
vacate
and
remand,
and
while
we
suggested
that
that
is
a
possible
alternative
in
our
reply
brief,
it
seems
to
us
to
make
much
more
sense
that
since
there
are
a
lot
of
cases
out
there
with
differing
results
and
in
differing
stages.
and
this
issue
is
properly
presented.
the
legislative
history
is
unambiguous
that
the
court
should
simply
decide
that
issue,
and
should
decide
it
not
on
the
basis
that
the
1984
legislation
should
be
presumed
to
apply
retroactively,
but
rather
to
recognize
that
the
1984
legislation
ratified
the
secretary's
understanding
of
the
proper
approach
to
the
1981
statute,
and
by
so
doing,
the
court
would,
of
course,
reverse
the
judgment
below.
thank
you.

mr.

no,
