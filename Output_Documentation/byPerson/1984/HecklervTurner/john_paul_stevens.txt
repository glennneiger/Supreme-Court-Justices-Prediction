justice
stevens
--mr.
phillips,
can
i
return
for
a
minute
to
the
new
federal
statute,
because
i
want
to
be
sure
i
understand
your
position.
is
it
your
view
that
if
the
ninth
circuit
was
correct
when
it
decided
the
case,
and
then
congress
enacted
a
new
statute
earlier
this
year
and
said,
we
want
a
different
rule
in
the
future,
we
should
nevertheless
apply
the
new
statute?
justice
stevens
do
you
think
it
is
a
valid
argument?
justice
stevens
the
reason
i
ask
you,
it
seems
to
me
it
is
entirely
consistent
with
everything
we
know
about
this
field
of
the
law,
but
if
we
just
sent
it
back
to
the
ninth
circuit
to
reexamine
the
issue
in
the
light
of
the
new
statute,
they
might
say,
yes,
but
the
statute
is
prospective
only.
that
could
happen,
couldn't
it?
justice
stevens
so
you
think
we
really
have
to
decide
the
case.
justice
stevens
mr.
phillips,
can
i
just
ask
you
another
practical
question?
assume
we
were
to
dismiss
the
case
as
improvidently
granted
or
something
of
that
kind,
which
i
am
not
suggesting
we
should,
but
what
exactly
would
happen?
is
there
a
stay
in
effect?
justice
stevens
in
other
words,
they
would
then
have
a
claim
for
unpaid
moneys
under
the
ninth
circuit.
