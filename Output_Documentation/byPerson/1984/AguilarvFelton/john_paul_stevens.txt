justice

mr.
solicitor,
can
i
ask
this
one
question
about
any
possible
impact
on
establishment
clause
values?
this
is
the
case,
i
believe,
in
which
there
is
the
desanctification
of
the
classrooms.
they
must
remove
religious
objects
from
the
classroom.
do
you
think
that
if
a
religious
school
is
told
that
you
can
have
some
money
or
some
public
benefit
if
you
take
down
some
religious
objects
from
your
classroom,
that
that
has
any
impact
at
all
on--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--but
it
is
a
condition,
is
it
not?
