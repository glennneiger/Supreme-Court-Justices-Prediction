we
will
hear
arguments
next
in
aguilar
against
felton
and
consolidated
cases.
mr.
solicitor
general,
i
think
you
may
rest.
i
think
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready,
mr.
solicitor
general.
chief
justice
burger
i
take
it
your
answer
in
effect
is,
your
response
is
that
if
the
religious
symbols
were
left
in
the
room,
your
adversaries
would
hammer
you
with
that
fact,
and
therefore
at
most
removing
them
neutralizes
the
problem.

mr.

chief
justice
burger
do
you
mean
that
if
congress
takes
some
additional

will
prevail?

schools.
chief
justice

are
you
suggesting,
mr.
geller,
that
religious
dogma
could
be
somehow
subtly
filtered
into
remedial
mathematics?
chief
justice

e.
burger
your
time
has
expired
now,
