justice
blackmun
and
what
has
happened
to
the
pearl
case?
justice
blackmun
did
they
try
to
appeal
it
here?
justice
blackmun
dismissed
for
want
of
jurisdiction?
justice
blackmun
because
of
failure
to
meet
deadlines?
justice
blackmun
was
the
entire
court
in
agreement
with
your
statement
just
made?
justice
blackmun
but
that
is
a
factual
statement
that
you
are
making.
justice
blackmun
in
this
connection,
do
you
have
any
comment
on
the
missouri
case?
justice
blackmun
so
that
if
you
prevail
here,
that
does
not
necessarily
mean
you
will
prevail
in
the
missouri
case.
justice
blackmun
well,
you
sent
a
copy
of
it
up
here,
as
did
your
opponents,
and
at
least
a
cursory
review
of
it
would
indicate
that
things
were
done
in
the
missouri
case
which
you
claim
are
not
done
here.
justice
blackmun
at
least
that
shows
the
possibility
of
abuse.
justice
blackmun
mr.
geller,
before
the
noon
bell
rings,
i
want
to
ask
you
this.
if
this
case
is
reversed
and
the
ruling
is
against
you,
can
the
court
make
that
reversal
without
overruling
meek
against
pittenger
in
your
estimation?
justice
blackmun
so
that's
for
the
court
to
be
candid
in
reversing,
it
must
overrule
meek
against
pittenger.
