mr.
rex
e.
lee
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
at
issue
in
this
case
is
the
constitutionality
of
a
key
feature
of
title
1
of
the
elementary
and
secondary
education
act
of
1965.
over
the
19
years
of
its
existence,
title
1
has
been
universally
recognized
and
hailed
as
the
largest
and
most
successful
federal
educational
effort.
the
congressional
objective
was
to
break
the
poverty
cycle
at
its
most
vulnerable
point
by
providing
supplemental
remedial
educational
services,
such
as
remedial
reading
and
remedial
math,
to
children
who
meet
two
qualifications.
the
first
is
educational
deprivation,
which
means
performance
at
a
level
below
normal
for
their
age,
and
the
second
is
residence
in
an
area
that
has
a
high
concentration
of
families
with
incomes
below
the
poverty
level.
pursuant
to
department
of
education
regulations,
title
1
programs
are
administered
by
local
public
school
boards
denominated
by
the
regulations
as
local
education
agencies.
one
thing
that
is
not
at
issue
in
this
case
is
that
title
1
is
a
program
that
works.
everyone
agrees
that
children
at
all
levels
have
experienced
significant
measurable
advances
thanks
to
the
benefits
of
this
program.
the
court
of
appeals
which
held
it
unconstitutional
described
it
as
a
program
that
apparently
has
done
so
much
good
and
little,
if
any,
detectable
harm,
and
the
appellees
agree,
having
acknowledged
it
as
a
good
and
successful
program
that
has
contributed
substantially
to
the
educational
needs
of
educationally
deprived
children.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
those
that
have
had
experience
with
title
1,
justice
o'connor,
have
almost
universally
come
to
the
conclusion
that
off
premises
just
doesn't
work,
that
it
is
educationally
unsound.
i
am
informed
by
my
colleagues
at
the
department
of
education
that
there
is
one
special
circumstance
in
one
school
district
that
has
been
able
to
make
it
work
because
of
special
circumstances.
the
department
of--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--i
am
not
certain
that
that
is
the
case.
i
am
only
aware
of
one
where
it
in
fact
has
been
able
to
work.
now,
i
should
add
this,
that
in
a
study
done
by
the
department
of
education
in
the
state
of
missouri,
and
this
quote
is
in
the
brief,
and
of
course
the
study
itself
is
in
the
record,
the
department
of
education
based
on
that
study
raised
the
question
whether
off
premises
title
1
services
could
ever
really
be
comparable
as
congress
declared
that
it
should
be.
and
the
facts
of
this
case
demonstrate
why
that
is
a
problem.
there
are
theoretically
four
possible
time
and
place
combinations
available
to
any
local
education
agency
that
is
charged
with
the
responsibility
of
seeing
to
it
that
title
1
programs
offered
to
nonpublic
schools
are
comparable
to
the
programs
that
are
available
to
public
school
children.
those
four
combinations
are
off
premises
during
the
regular
school
hours,
off
premises
after
hours
or
before
hours,
on
premises
during
the
regular
school
hours,
and
on
premises
after
hours.
during
the
1965-66
school
year,
the
new
york
city
board
of
education
explored
all
three
of
the
other
alternatives
before
settling
on
the
one
at
issue
in
this
case
as
the
only
one
that
was
educationally
sound.
its
experience
with
the
two
after
hours
options
demonstrated
them
both
to
be
what
the
board
described
as
a
total
failure.
the
students
were
tired.
the
parents
were
concerned
about
safety.
there
was
something
of
a
stigma
effect
because
the
students,
many
of
them
concluded
that
they
were
being
punished
because
they
were
required
to
stay
after
school,
and
communication
between
title
1
teachers
and
the
regular
classroom
teachers
was
virtually
impossible.
we
turn
now
to
the
off
premises
options,
which
is
more
directly
responsive
to
your
question.
what
new
york
found
was
that
in
addition
to
those
problems
that
characterized
the
after
hours
problems,
and
there
are
some
of
those,
because
any
time
you
go
off
premises
you
consume
prime
time
that
ought
to
be
used
for
study,
and
prime
time
is
particularly
important
when
you
have
students
whose
motivation
is
in
any
event
below
average.
it
is
particularly
important
that
it
be
used
for
study
purposes.
but
the
other
problem
with
off
premises,
unless
it
is
just
very,
very
close,
is
the
cost.
in
order
to
pay
the
transportation
and
other
noninstructional
costs
in
the
case
of
this
particular
program
would
have
consumed
about
42
percent
of
the
total
nonpublic
title
1
budget
for
the
city
of
new
york,
and
that
would
have
meant
that
about
5,000
children
in
new
york
city
would
have
been
deprived
of
title
1
services.
it
literally
would
have
been
a
trade
of
bus
services
for
title
1
services.
and
since
the
department
of
education
has
consistently
interpreted
the
equal
expenditure
provision
as
requiring
that
instructional
services
be
equal,
most
of
the
children
eliminated
from
the
program
in
order
to
pay
these
noninstructional
costs
would
have
been
public
school
students.
in
short,
the
new
york
city
board
of
education
was
bound
by
the
congressional
mandate
to
provide
comparable
services
to
children
attending
public
and
nonpublic
schools.
this
court
in
wheeler
versus
parrera
held
that
the
plenary
responsibility
for
determining
whether
the
nonpublic
program
did
or
did
not
comply
with
the
comparability
requirement
set
by
congress
was
to
be
vested
in
the
local
education
agency,
and
that
is
exactly
what
the
new
york
board
of
education
did,
and
its
selection
of
the
option
which
would
fulfill
that
obligation
was
based
purely
on
educational
considerations.
the
board's
actual
experience
showed
what
common
sense
would
in
any
event
have
confirmed,
that
children
learn
better
when
they
are
not
tired,
that
they
can
learn
better
in
a
classroom
than
they
can
on
a
school
bus,
and
that
money
and
time
spent
for
transportation
doesn't
do
much
to
remedy
reading
or
math
deficiencies.
this
case
is
different
from
others
that
have
previously
come
before
this
court
in
that
we
are
not
left
to
speculate
about
how
the
program
might
work.
this
one
has
been
in
existence
for
over
18
years.
the
case
was
tried
based
on
an
extensive
record
developed
before
an
earlier
three-judge
district
court
in
a
case
called
the
pearl
case,
and
on
selected
additional
affidavits
and
documents.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
the
pearl
case,
justice
brennan,
went
to
a
decision
by
the
three-judge
district
court,
including
findings,
and
then
the
appellants...
and
it
was
favorable
to
the
program.
it
was
held
constitutional.
then
the
appellants
in
that
case
failed
to
perfect
their
appeal
to
this
case,
so
it
became
res
judicata.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
yes,
but
it
was
a
technical
deficiency
in
the--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--that
is
correct.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
that
is
correct.
that
is
exactly
correct.
then
this
case
was
tried
on
the
basis
of
the
pearl
record
plus
additional
affidavits,
so
we
have
the
unfortunate
circumstance
where
in
my
experience
it
is
the
first
time
that
you
have
findings
by
two
separate
trial
courts,
and
those
findings
are
identical.
the
pearl
court,
for
example,
found
that
in
compliance
with
the
extensive
title
1
regulations,
new
york
had
established
what
it
called
a
well
defined
dichotomy
between
purely
secular
instruction
and
activity
subject
to
religious
influences,
and
those
findings
were
confirmed
by
the
findings
of
the
district
court
in
this
case,
and
i
quote,
"the
concerns
of
the
meek
court
about
the
potential
for
the
unconstitutional
mingling
of
government
and
religion
in
the
administration
of
this
type
of
program
have
not
materialized.
"
these
findings
are
buttressed
by
uncontradicted
evidence
in
the
record
that
the
services
are
provided
in
religiously
neutral
locations.
there
have
been
no
instances
of
title
1
teachers
being
pressured
or
influenced
by
private
school
personnel,
and
no
instances
of
title
1
teachers
advancing
religion.
i
would
like
to
make
two
comments
with
respect
to
these
findings
by
two
separate
trial
courts.
the
first
is
that
they
really
only
confirm
what
in
any
event
a
common
sense
examination
of
these
programs
would
have
told
us.
even
if
we
could
ignore
what
actually
happened,
this
just
isn't
the
kind
of
case
that
raises
serious
risks
that
government
is
going
to
establish
a
religion.
this
is
not
a
case
like
lemon
versus
kurtzman
where
church
personnel
are
teaching
across
a
broad
spectrum
of
subjects.
these
are
public
school
teachers.
their
job
is
to
teach
supplemental
remedial
courses.
their
task
is
difficult.
it
has
a
narrow
focus.
and
it
supplements
the
core
curriculum.
just
how
is
it
even
if
the
record
didn't
show
otherwise
that
religious
indoctrination
is
somehow
supposed
to
infiltrate
this
process.
is
the
danger
that
public
school
teachers
might
teach
religion?
if
that
is
the
supposed
risk,
why
have
the
appellees
failed
to
uncover
even
one
single
instance
in
which
that
actually
in
fact
occurred
over
the
almost
two
decades
the
program
has
been
in
existence?
and
in
any
event,
the
argument
proves
too
much,
because
the
risk
is
just
as
great
when
public
employees
teach
in
public
schools.
well,
if
that
is
not
the
risk,
is
it
the
danger
that
the
nonpublic
teachers
will,
once
these
public
professionals
come
on
with
their...
somehow
block
these
public
teachers
and
indoctrine
them?
surely
the
courts'
decisions
suggesting
a
distinction
between
aid
to
elementary
schools
and
aid
to
colleges
would
teach
that
indoctrination
of
other
adults
is
not
the
risk
with
which
this
court's
establishment
clause
jurisprudence
is
concerned.
those
distinctions
apply
a
fortiori
when
it
is
not
college
students
but
college
graduates,
professional
teachers.
in
short,
there
is
an
air
of
unreality
about
the
notion
that
this
program
is
a
candidate
for
serious
problems
of
religious
indoctrination,
and
the
actual
record
completely
belies
the
notion
that
extensive
surveillance
was
required
on
that
it
actually
occurred.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
well,
i
would
hope
that
in
that
very
unfortunate
event
that
the
court
would
not
err
twice.
0
[generallaughter.]
mr.
rex
e.
lee
of
course
it
is.
the
distinctions
that
i
would
suggest
are
not
controlling
and
should
not
be
controlled.
there
are
a
couple
of
distinctions,
and
i
think
they
were
adequately
brought
out
in
the
previous
argument.
it
may
be
a
little
easier
to
identify
these
as
supplemental
and
as
non-core,
but
that
is
only
because
of
this
happenstance.
there
is
a
statute,
and
it
is
cited
at...
a
section
of
the
statute.
it
is
section
3807(b)
of
the
statute,
which
specifically
requires,
which
specifically
prohibits
any
of
the
title
1
funds
being
used
for
regular
curriculum
purposes,
and
it
cannot
be
used
to
provide
services
that
are
not
otherwise
available,
and
if
they
are
used
for
those
purposes,
then
we
sue
to
get
the
money
back.
we
have
done
it
before,
and
we
have
another
case
that
will
be
here
later
this
year
involving,
in
this
instance,
services
that
are
used
for...
that
were
otherwise
available,
but
the
lesson
that
comes
from
that
is
not
that
the
grand
rapids
program
is
bad
and
ours
is
good.
it
is
rather
that
the...
that
this
rather
clean
analytical
framework
has
been
provided
where
you
have
a
federal
government
that
is
not
in
the
education
business
and
therefore
must
necessarily
superimpose
its
remedial
program
on
an
existing
program
as
demonstrating
the
clean
distinction
between
remedial
programs
on
the
one
hand
and
core
curriculum
programs
on
the
other.
but
that
distinction
should
be
no
less
available
to
a
state
that
does
not
have
a
similarly
clean
analytical
framework
because
there
is
just
as
much
of
a
distinction
between
remedial
programs
and
non-remedial
programs.
now,
there
is
one
other
distinction,
and
it
is
not
one
that
is
dispositive,
but
it
is
certainly
one
that...
well,
i
think
it
is
persuasive,
and
that
is
that
these...
that
this
is,
after
all,
a
congressional
determination
that
we
are
dealing
with.
surely
a
congress...
well,
in
the
final
analysis
the
issue
here
is
whether
congress
can
require
that
its
benefits
be
spread
equally.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
i
do
not
mean
to
suggest,
justice
rehnquist,
that
that
is
a
distinction
between
this
case
and
the
grand
rapids
case.
i
simply
mean
to
suggest
that
whether
in
the
context
of
either
a
congressional
determination
or
a
determination
by
the
grand
rapids
school
board
that
we
are
dealing
here
basically
with
policy
judgments
that
are
entitled
to
be
upheld,
and
i
would
like
to
explain
what
the
basis
for
that
is.
we
have
here
a
problem
that
has
been
faced
by
three
separate
branches
of
government
at
two
different
levels
of
government.
on
the
one,
from
the
legislative
branch,
congress
has
made
its
basic
policy
decision
to
spread
the
benefits
of
this
program
equally
between
public
and
nonpublic
students.
a
local
executive
agency
has
done
a
commendably
conscientious
and
thorough
job
of
administering
that
decision,
of
implementing
that
decision
consistent
with
sound
educational
practices
and
two
separate
trial
courts
have
found
that
the
concerns
hypothesized
in
other
cases
have
not
materialized
in
this
one.
if
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
affirmed,
the
comparability
requirement
acknowledged
by
this
court
in
wheeler
will
still
be
in
place,
as
will
most
aspects
of
title
1.
the
consequence
will
not
be,
as
mr.
geller
argues
in
his
brief,
that
all
those
title
1
funds
will
then
simply
be
transferred
over
to
the
public
sphere,
because
if
the
court
of
appeals
is
correct
that
it
is
the
on
premises
function
that
renders
it
unconstitutional,
you
still
have
in
place
the
congressional
determination
that
these
programs
must
be
equal,
but
with
the
one
option
that
has
been
demonstrated
to
be
educationally
sound,
the
most
educationally
sound
and
available.
so
that
the
result
will
be
a
program
which
still
serves
both
public
and
nonpublic
children
but
serves
fewer
of
them,
some
of
them
not
as
well,
a
program
which
will
expend
scarce
dollars
and
student
time
on
bus
rides
instead
of
remedial
instruction.
now,
all
of
that,
we
are
told,
is
required
not
because
of
anything
in
this
record,
but
because
this
court
held,
laid
down
in
meek
versus
pittenger
a
per
se
rule
that
requires
us
to
ignore
the
actual
facts
of
the
particular
case,
and
instead
erects
a
per
se
rule
that
any
on
premises
instruction
constitutes
an
establishment
of
religion,
and
the
court
of
appeals
simply
misread
meek
versus
pittenger.
this
court
made
it
very
clear
in
lynch
versus
donnelly
that
the
court
has
consistently
declined,
and
i
am
quoting,
"to
take
a
rigid,
absolutist
view
of
the
establishment
clause,
and
that
in
each
case
the
inquiry
calls
for
line
drawing.
"
"no
fixed
per
se
rule
can
be
framed.
"
mr.
rex
e.
lee
lynch
versus
donnelly,
as
you
indicated,
justice...
as
you
implied,
justice
blackmun,
was
a
five-four
decision.
but
it
was,
of
course,
a
holding
of
the
court.
moreover--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--excuse
me.
i
guess
i
misunderstood
the
question.
it
is
correct
that
lynch
versus
donnelly
was
a
five-four
decision,
and
i
have
correctly
quoted
from
the
lynch
majority.
in
meek
there
was
no
actual
experience,
and
here
there
is.
we
would
not
be
in
this
courtroom
today,
moreover,
if
the
constitution
prohibited
all
title
1
services
on
parochial
premises
because
such
a
rule
would
have
been
dispositive
when
title
1
was
before
this
court
in
1974
in
wheeler
versus
barrera.
rather
than
deciding
for
all
time
and
all
purposes
that
on
premises
instruction
was
mandated
by
the
first
amendment,
this
court
rather
carefully
outlined...
declined
to
reach
that
issue
on
that
case
specifically
for
this
reason,
that
it
would
be
wholly
inappropriate
for
us
to
attempt
to
render
an
opinion
on
the
first
amendment
when
no
specific
plan
is
before
us.
a
federal
court
does
not
sit
to
render
a
decision
on
hypothetical
facts,
and
the
court
of
appeals
was
correct
in
so
concluding,
and
i
believe
that
that
is
also
a
rejection
of
a
per
se
approach
in
these
establishment
areas.
moreover,
perhaps
even
more
helpful
is
an
example
that
the
court
used
in
wheeler
versus
parrera
in
which
it
gave
some
of
the
types
of
problems,
some
of
the
types
of
possibilities
that
might
be
considered
by
a
local
education
agency
in
performing
its
responsibility
to
assure
that
these
programs
were
comparable,
and
i
am
quoting.
"for
example,
a
program
whereby
a
former
parochial
school
teacher
is
paid
with
title
1
funds
to
teach
full
time
in
a
parochial
school
undoubtedly
would
present
quite
different
problems
than
if
a
public
school
teacher
solely
under
public
control
is
sent
into
a
parochial
school
to
teach
special
remedial
courses
a
few
hours
a
week.
"
now,
that
was
not
a
ruling
on
the
constitutional
issue,
but
it
does
identify
a
range
of
possibilities
that
might
be
considered,
and
it
precisely
describes
the
title
1
experience,
which
is
presumably
at
the
permissible
end
of
that
range.
it
is
difficult,
i
submit,
to
see
how
in
this
case,
on
this
record,
there
has
been
any
establishment
of
religion.
certainly
none
has
been
proven.
and
even
the
court
of
appeals
recognized
that
it
depended
on
its
view
of
meek
versus
pittenger
to
reach
that
conclusion.
it
is
also
difficult
to
see
that
there
has
even
been
any
injury
to
what
might
be
called
establishment
clause
values,
and
most
difficult
of
all
to
perceive
how
those
values
are
possibly
enhanced
by
making
such
a
successful
program
more
cumbersome,
more
expensive,
and
less
effective.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
no,
justice
stevens,
i
really
don't,
for
this
reason.
that
really
isn't
the
way
the
option
is
put
to
them
under
the
title
1
program.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
well,
i
don't
know
whether
it
would
be
constitutional
and
therefore
acceptable
to
the
title
1
administrators
if
there
were
or
were
not...
the
religious
objects
were
or
were
not
removed,
but
that
is
a
decision
that
the
parochial
schools
have
made
in
making
their
application,
and
i
think
this
court
has
observed
on
a
number
of
occasions
that
we
have
to
be
a
bit
sensitive
about
not
getting,
on
the
one
hand,
what
is
demanded
by
the
constitution,
what
is
demanded
by
the
constitution,
and
on
the
other
hand
what
is
permitted
by
the
constitution,
so
close
that
there
isn't
any
room
to
steer
between
that
cylla
and
caribda,
and
frankly,
it
is
almost
a
damned
if
you
do
and
damned
if
you
don't
option
that
is
left
to
the
church
school.
i
know
my
opponents
make
this
point,
but
i
just
don't
find
it
that
persuasive.
i
think
that
is
their
judgment.
it
is
their
judgment
to
make
an
application
for
these
title
1
funds,
and
i
think
it
lies
within
the
proper
scope.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
of
course.
that
is
exactly
right.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
i
agree
with
mr.
ripple,
justice
blackmun,
that
the
missouri
case,
like
all
cases,
will
stand
on
its
own
facts
and
on
its
own
record.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
that
is
correct.
that
case
will
have
to
be
examined
on
its
own
facts
and
its
own
record,
and
i
am
not
sufficiently
familiar
with
the
missouri
case
at
this
point
to
express
an
opinion.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
i
think
that's
correct.
let
me
just--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--and
you
have
laid...
you
have
put
your
finger,
justice
blackmun,
on
what
i
think
is
the
most
important
key
in
this
case,
and
that
is
that
consistent
with
what
the
court
said
in
wheeler
versus
barrera,
these
cases
have
to
be
approached
on
a
case
by
case
basis.
you
also
said
in
the
rohmer
case...
excuse
me,
in
the
regan
case
that
in
a
slightly
different
context
the
parties
had
simply
misread
meek
when
they
read
it
to
apply
a
per
se
rule,
and
that,
i
think,
is
the
most
important
principle
to
come
out
of
this
case.
it
would
be
a
real
travesty
if
under
the
religion
clauses
the
net
result
of
this
particular
litigation
would
be
to
convert
such
a
successful
program
into
one
which
deprives
thousands
of
needy
children
of
all
title
1
benefits
all
because
the
parents
of
some
of
those
children
exercised
their
first
amendment
rights.
unless
the
court
has
further
questions,
i
will
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
just
two
brief
points,
mr.
chief
justice.
the
first
is
that
we
have
been
exposed
to
a
proposed
first
amendment
jurisprudence
that
is
nothing
less
than
astounding
and
that
would
completely
turn
on
their
heads
these
propositions
that
i
had
always
assumed
to
be
fundamental,
that
constitution
are
presumed
to
be
constitutional,
that
plaintiffs
have
the
burden
of
proof,
that
findings
are
controlling
unless
clearly
erroneous
and
cannot
be
overcome
by
speculation.
my
second
point
responds
to
mr.
geller's
suggestion
that
congress
may
change
its
mind
if
this
court
were
to
affirm,
and
to
revoke
the
determination
that
it
has
now
made
or
three
occasions
that
these
funds
should
be
equal,
equally
available,
those
who
do
and
those
who
do
not
exercise
their
constitutional
right
to
send
their
children
to
private
schools.
and
i
submit
that
if
that
were
to
be
the
case,
and
congress
were
to
be
told
that
it
has
no
option
other
than
to
do
that,
that
that
result
would
be
even
less
consonant
with
the
religion
clauses,
less
consonant
with
basic
separation
of
powers
principles,
and
the
kinds
of
judgments
that
ought
to
be
left
to
congress,
and
would
be
an
outrage
to
principles
of
basic
fairness,
particularly
given
the
fact
that
we
are
dealing
here
with
a
congressional
determination
that
has
been
made
by
a
legislative
body
that
has
been
held
to
have
a
wide
discretion
with
respect
to
its
spending
power,
and
that
the
choice
to
attend
a
religious
school
is
itself
constitutionally
protected.
so
that
the
parents
in
poverty
areas
are
put
really
to
this
option.
they
must
either
give
up
their
right
to
a
religious
education
or
forfeit
an
equitable
and
equal
share
in
this
program
that
is
purely
secular
and
is
purely
directed
at
creating
educational
equality
and
has
proven
to
be
so
successful.
it
would
be
the
ultimate
constitutional
irony
if
the
religion
clauses
were
the
source
of
a
rule
which
put
the
parents
of
private
school
children
to
that
option.
thank
you.
