justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
mean
a
congressional
determination
as
opposed
to
a
state
determination?
well,
i
think
that
would
be
the
ultimate
irony,
that
you
would
take
the
religion
clauses
of
the
first
amendment
which
by
their
terms
apply
to
congress
and
only
through
the
adoption
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
have
been
held
to
apply
to
the
states
and
now
say
they
apply
with
greater
force
to
the
states
than
to
congress.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
did
the
court
of
appeals
reject
findings
of
fact
that
had
been
made
by
the
district
court?
justice
rehnquist
mr.
geller?
justice
rehnquist
is
there
anything
in
the
present
record
that
indicates
any
incidents
like
these
actually
happened?
justice
rehnquist
that
may
be
the
hypothesis
of
those
cases,
but
i
don't
think
the
hypothesis
was
based
on
the
sort
of
speculation
that
you
were
engaging
in.
