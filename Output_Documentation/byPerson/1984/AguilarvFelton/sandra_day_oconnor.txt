general
lee,
these
programs
are
offered
nationwide.
are
there
some
around
the
country
that
are
not
offered
on
the
premises
of
the
private
schools?
and
would
you
be
able
to
characterize
the
extent
to
which
other
programs
under
title
1
are
offered
within
public
schools?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
is
there
then
only
one
school
district
in
the
nation
that
is
offering
it?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
mr.
geller--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--mr.
geller,
maybe
i
don't
understand
the
program.
i
thought
it
just
took
selected
students
out
of
some
classes
under
the
title
1
program,
and
was
not
in
fact
reducing
the
number
of
teachers
required
in
the
private
school
to
do
that.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
thought
it
was
taking
selected
students
and
giving
them
some
remedial
programs.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
now,
is
that
correct?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
it
is
not
reducing
the
number
of
teachers
required?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
geller,
how
do
you
think
that
the
program
is
generally
perceived
by
the
community
at
large?
is
it
perceived
as
a
program
to
aid
disadvantaged
children,
or
a
program
perceived
as
aiding
religious
schools?
justice
o'connor
your
answer
is,
it
just
isn't
perceived
at
all,
either
way.
