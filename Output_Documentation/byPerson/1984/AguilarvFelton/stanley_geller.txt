mr.
stanley
geller
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
i
am
glad
that
after
about
one
hour
and
perhaps
15
minutes
somebody
who
stood
up
to
argue
before
you
mentioned
meek
against
pittenger.
i
thought
that
was
never
going
to
be
mentioned,
because
the
appellees
do
not
come
before
this
court
in
a
void.
there
have
been
decisions
by
the
court
not
only
in
meek
but
in
marburger
and
there
is
the
rationale
of
the
decision
in
lemon
against
kurtzman
and
the
rationale
of
the
decision
in
wolman
against
walter
that
firmly
support
the
position
that
the
appellees
took
in
this
case.
and
while
we
are
mentioning
that
there
were
two
lower
courts
that
decided
on
the
new
york
city
title
1
program
before
the
court
of
appeals
did
so
after
an
alleged
trial
record,
keep
in
mind
that
the
trial,
the
so-called
trial
in
this
case
consisted
merely
of
the
submission
of
written
affidavits.
there
were
no
witnesses.
there
was
no
credibility.
the
same
affidavits
were
before
the
court
of
appeals,
and
the
court
of
appeals
unanimously
decided
otherwise
than
the
district
courts
on
the
same
record,
and
with
the
same
ability
to
do
so.
mr.
stanley
geller
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
reject
the
findings
of
fact.
it
rejected
the
conclusions
that
were
drawn
from
those
findings,
and
i
will
go
into
the
findings
of
fact
because
i
don't
believe
that
this
so-called
record
supports
the
position
that
the
government
and
the
board
of
education
and
the
intervenors
take
in
this
appeal,
and
i
will
tell
you
why.
but
first,
let
me
say
this
about
the
benefits
of
the
statute.
we
agree
with
the
appellants
that
this
is
a
good
statute
and
a
good
program,
and
it
benefits
needy
children,
and
there
need
be
no
change
in
that.
i
am
amazed
that
the
solicitor
general
gets
up
and
says
that
if
you
should
strike
down
this
program,
that
it
will
affect
thousands
of
children.
it
need
not
affect
one,
and
i
pointed
that
out
in
my
memorandum,
and
it
was
not
countered
by
the
appellants
in
their
memorandum.
there
have
never
been
enough
funds
in
the
title
1
program
to
provide
for
all
of
the
eligible
children
in
the
program,
so
that
if
the...
and
just
confining
ourselves
to
the
new
york
city
program,
if
you
took
the
20,000
children,
and
that
is
the
total
of
it,
who
are
now
in
that
program,
in
the
parochial
schools
mainly
of
new
york,
if
you
took
them
out
of
the
program,
you
would
be
able
to
use
those
funds
to
provide
the
benefits
to
20,000
eligible
children
in
the
public
schools
of
new
york
who
now
do
not
receive
the
benefits
of
the
program.
in
other
words,
the
only
thing
that
stops
this,
of
course,
is
that
the
statute
says
that
the
aid
must
be
provided
equally,
but
i
cannot
believe
that
the
administration
and
the
congress,
faced
with
a
purpose,
which
i
understand
to
be
their
purpose,
to
provide
aid
to
needy
children,
would
then
waste
money
trying
to
get,
if
this
court
struck
down
the
program,
waste
money
trying
to
get
services
to
needy
children
in
parochial
schools
when
they
could
take
the
same
money
and
provide
the
same
needy
children
in
the
same
school
district
with
the
full
benefits
of
the
title
1
program.
if
this
court
struck
down
this
program
as
it
is
now
applied,
it
need
not,
if
congress
acts
rationally,
which
i
would
assume
it
would
do,
affect
the
purpose
of
congress,
which
is
to
provide
aid
to
needy
children.
mr.
stanley
geller
yes,
i
do,
your
honor,
and
what
i
cannot
believe
is
that
faced
with
a
report
from
the
administration
and
from
the
solicitor
general
that
the
program
just
doesn't
work
off
premises,
that
congress
would
insist
on
wasting
money
trying
to
deliver
aid
to
the
needy
children
in
parochial
schools
when
they
could
supply
the
same
aid
to
needy
children
from
the
same
background
who
happen
to
be
attending
public
schools.
and,
your
honor,
i
really
do
not
accept
the
presumption
which
is
made
in
this
case
that
the
parochial
school
students
in
new
york
city
go
to
their
schools
primarily
even
because
of
their
religious
beliefs.
they
are
going
to
private
schools
because
their
parents
perhaps
don't
want
them
to
go
to
public
schools,
and
if
the
aid
were
changed
in
this
case,
congress
would
achieve
its
educational
purpose.
it
might
not
achieve
a
purpose.
it
might
not
achieve
a
purpose
that
runs
afoul
of
the
establishment
clause,
but
it
could
surely
achieve
its
educational
purpose
100
percent
in
the
way
in
which
it
is
achieving
now.
the
only
question...
the
question...
i
won't
say
the
only
question,
but
the
question
that
then
arises
may
arise
under
the
equal
protection
clause
or
the
preexercise
clause,
but
i
understand
that
this
court
has
decided
that
when
it
decided
that
no
state
need
supply
every
service
to
parochial
schools
that
it
supplies
to
private
schools.
let
me
go
to
the
question
of
the
record
in
this
case
and
what
it
professes
to
show,
however,
but
let
me
start
by
saying
what
i
understand
and
i
think
is
conceded
about
what
this
court
determined
in
meek
and
marburger,
and
again
in...
really
in
lemon
and
kurzman.
this
court
decided
all
of
those
cases
and
the
statutes
and
the
programs
in
those
cases
on
the
face
of
the
statute.
it
held
that
it
had
sufficient
common
sense,
as
the
solicitor
general
argues,
and
the
experience
to
know
that
when
you
place
teachers
and
counselors
on
the
premises
of
public
schools,
you
have
created
a
grave
potential
that
they
would
in
some
manner
foster
religion,
and
the
manner
in
which
they
do
that
i
will
come
to
in
a
moment.
it
is
not
in
the
way
that
the
solicitor
general
mentioned.
and
the
court
said
further,
the
only
way
you
can
avoid
that
potential
danger
is
to
have
an
almost
inquisitorial
surveillance,
one
which
is
so
comprehensive
and
discriminating
and
continuing
that
the
surveillance
in
itself
would
bring
about
an
excessive
entanglement
that
was
an
evil
as
great
as
the
evil
it
sought
to
guard
against,
that
of
government
fostering
of
religion.
i
don't...
let
me
add
just
one
thing.
the
court
said,
and
this
was
a
corollary,
that
surveillance
was,
as
far
as
it
could
see,
the
only
way
in
which
you
could
avoid
this
government
fostering
of
religion
because
you
could
not
rely
on
the
good
faith
and
the
professionalism
of
the
teachers.
on
that
score,
i
would
like
to
make
one
further
point.
some
distinction
appears
to
be
attempted
to
be
made
between
lemon
and
kurtzman
and
meek,
because
in
lemon
and
kurtman
the
teachers
were
religious
school
teachers,
and
somehow
the
idea
is
that
you
could
not
accept
the
word
of
a
religious
school
teacher
that
he
would
not
engage
in
some
act
that
would
foster
religion,
but
you
can
accept
the
word
of
a
public
school
teacher.
i
don't
think
that
makes
any
sense
at
all,
and
that
in
fact
when
it
comes
to
award,
you
might
well
be
more
willing,
if
anything,
to
accept
the
word
of
a
devoted
nun,
brother,
priest,
that
he
would
not
violate
the
establishment
clause
than
that
of
any
public
school
teacher.
in
this
case,
the
present
case,
the
appellants
come
before
you
and
they
say
you
were
wrong
deciding
meek
and
marburger
and
lemon
facially
because
now
you
have
before
you
18
years
of
actual
experience.
they
say
that
the
record
shows
that
there
is
no
evidence
of
an
actual
fostering
of
religion
primarily,
primarily
by
specific
overt
acts
of
teachers
or
guidance
counselors
actually
inserting
religious
matter
into
their
teaching.
the
same
record,
however,
shows
you
that
you
don't
have
any
evidence
of
a
real
system
of
surveillance
that
the
court
said
in
meek
and
marburger
and
lemon
would
be
required
to
detect
that
evidence
of
government
fostering
of
religion
and
to
guard
against
it.
so,
in
the
record
that
you
have
now
before
you,
you
are
still
being
asked
to
rely
on
the
good
faith
and
professionalism
of
the
teachers,
because
the
only
way,
the
only
way
you
would
have
got
the
evidence
of
impermissible
conduct
on
the
part
of
the
teachers
and
counselors
was
that
if
they
committed
these
detectable
acts
of
impermissible
conduct,
they
would
have
turned
themselves
in.
there
is
no
other
way
short
of
surveillance,
of
getting
any
such
evidence.
you
either
have
to
get
it
from
the
teachers
and
the
guidance
counselors
themselves,
or
you
don't
get
it,
and
that
is
why
in
this
record...
that
is
why
this
record
is
no
proof
that
the
court
or
the
majority
of
the
court
were
incorrect
in
deciding
meek
and
marburger
and
lemon
facially.
on
the
record
also,
and
the
appellees
argue,
point
out
to
you
that
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
this
statute
has
done
much
good
and
little
detectable,
little
detectable
harm.
now,
i
put
it
to
you
that
the
kind
of
fostering
of
religion
that
this
record
would
show
is
not
the
kind
in
which
you
would
actually
find
overt
specific
acts
injecting
religious
matter
into
teaching.
the
kind
of
harm
actually
lies
elsewhere,
and
that
is
why
in
our
papers
we
argue
the
fact
that
actually
the
main
test
to
be
applied
here
or
a
main
test
is
the
primary
effect
test,
because
what
you
have
here
is
a
kind
of
aid
to
religion
which
does
not
lie
in
the
specific
or
overt
act,
but
lies
in
the
simple
fact
that
you
place
public
school
teachers
and
guidance
counselors
on
the
premises
of
public
schools
and
allow
them
to
teach
there.
how
is
that
done?
mr.
stanley
geller
yes.
mr.
stanley
geller
on
the
premises
of
private
schools.
how
is
that
done?
this
court
has
decided
before
that
the
placing
of
instructional
equipment
and
materials
on
the
premises
of
parochial
schools,
religious
schools
in
itself
would
be
impermissible,
but
now
you
don't
have
a
blackboard,
you
don't
have
a
piece
of
chalk.
now
you
have
a
real
live
teacher.
you
have
somebody
that
this
court
itself
in
the
past
has
said
is
at
the
center
of
the
educational
process,
and
in
addition,
you
have
a
remedial
teacher.
you
have
somebody
who
is...
without
whose
help
the
remedial
students
might
never
be
able
to
progress
at
all
in
their--
mr.
stanley
geller
--not
at
all,
your
honor.
i
agree
with
you
there,
and
i
would
be
foolish
to
argue
that
you
could
insert
religious
dogma
into
mathematics
or...
well,
the
other
subjects
are
easier,
because
when
you
have
remedial
reading,
you
have
broad
topics,
and
when
you
have
english
as
a
second
language,
you
also
have
a
broad
scope
of
topics
that
you
can
cover
in
teaching
it
so
that
it
is
possible.
but,
your
honor,
that
is
not
my
point.
it
would
be
very
difficult,
and
that
is
what
the
court
of
appeals
has
stated
quite
wisely,
to
detect
these
specific
overt
acts
of
injecting
religious
material
into
this
remedial
instruction.
the
aid
and
support
that
this
program,
any
program
of
supplying
teachers
and
counselors
onto
the
premises
of
private
schools...
parochial
schools
or
religious
schools
gives
to
those
schools
does
not
lie
in
the
injection
of
religious
matter
into
the
instruction.
it
lies
in
the
fact
that
you
are
providing
someone,
a
teacher
who
is...
actually
can
become
the
school
personified.
you
have
one
good,
admired,
well
respected
teacher
and
that
teacher
is
the
symbol
of
the
school
itself.
so
that
what
the
government,
what
the...
is
doing
in
a
case
of
this
kind
is
providing
a
means
by
which
teachers
enhance
the
image
and
the
reputation
of
the
school,
and
this
is
a
school
that
the
court
has
recognized
as
a
dominant
religious
mission,
and
that
is
the
way
in
which
this
kind
of
program
aids
the
religious
purpose
of
the
religious
schools.
there
are
concrete
ways,
however,
that
are
never
discussed
and
can
never
be
detected
because
you
would
never
find
the
specific
evidence.
in
this
case
you
have
a
remedial
teacher
teaching
remedial
students
who
are
the
poorest
students
in
the
school
educationally.
these
are
students
many
of
whom...
most
of
whom
do
not
like
school.
they
do
not
like
school,
and
the
the
only
school
that
they
know,
the
only
school
that
they
know
is
the
particular
school
to
which
they
are
going.
you
place
a
remedial
teacher
on
the
premises
to
give
them
instruction
or
a
guidance
counselor
and
the
guidance
counselor
is
confronted
by
the
remedial
student
with
the
fact
that
he
does
not
like
the
school.
he
says,
teacher,
this
is
a
rotten
school,
or
sister
regina,
my
regular
classroom
teacher,
is
a
bad
teacher.
or,
why
do
i
have
to
go
to...
and
say
religious
prayers
or
attend
religious
courses
in
this
school,
perhaps
even
when
the
student
is
not
in
a
parochial
school
a
catholic
student
where
the
religious
prayers
and
the
exercises
are
mandatory.
what
does
the
remedial
teacher
do
under
those
circumstances?
the
remedial
teacher,
whose
job
it
is
to
reintegrate
this
remedial
student
back
into
the
regular
program
of
the
school,
is
supportive
of
the
school.
that
is
not
injecting
religious
matter
into
the
instruction,
but
what
it
is
doing
is
supporting
the
school,
a
school
that
has
a
dominant
religious
mission.
the
remedial
teacher
says
to
the
student,
willy,
whatever
his
name
is,
this
school
has
your
best
interests
at
heart.
it
is
going
to
give
you
a
good
education,
and
when
you
grow
up
you
will
have
a
good
job,
and
you
will
be
able
to
lead
a
good
life.
or,
sister
regina
is
a
good
teacher.
she
has
got
your
interest
at
heart.
in
every
way--
mr.
stanley
geller
--yes.
mr.
stanley
geller
no,
your
honor,
and
that
is
what
the
court
of
appeals
pointed
out,
is
the
reason
why
there
is
little,
if
any,
detectable
harm.
this
is
a...
these
are
matters
that
are
not
subject
to
actual
proof.
you
are
not
going
to
get
little
school
children
to
come
in
and
tell
you
that
they
don't
like
school.
that
is
something
that
this
court
or
any
court
is
capable
of
knowing.
what
i
am
pointing
out
to
you
is
not
something
that
this
court
has
not
considered
before.
this
court
has
repeatedly
in
the
cases
involving
prayers
and
religious
exercises
noted
that
when
you
take
a
public
representative,
a
public
school
teacher,
or
the
public
school
system,
and
you
lend
that
system
to
religious
prayers
and
exercises
when
conducted
in
the
public
schools,
even
though
conducted
separately
in
the
public
schools,
as
in
mccollum,
what
you
are
doing
is
lending
the
prestige
and
the
power
of
the
public
school
system
to
these
prayers
and
religious
exercises
that
are
being
stated
separately
in
the
school.
the
situation
is--
mr.
stanley
geller
--yes,
your
honor,
it
was
based
on
just
that
speculation.
nobody
came
in
in
mccollum
and
testified,
and
testified
that
the
power
and
the
prestige
of
the
public
school
was
being
lent
to
the
religious
teacher
that
came
into
the
public
school
and
gave
religious
instruction
within
the
public
school.
that
was
a
fact
that
the
court
could
assume
on
the
basis
of
common
sense
and
experience,
and
it
did.
there
is
no
proof,
there
is
no
proof
that
the
public
school
system
lends
its
power
and
prestige
to
anything.
i
don't
see
where
you
would
get
that
concrete
proof
in
the
record.
and
what
the
court
did
in
mccollum
we
say
the
court
should
acknowledge
and
do
here.
when
you
take
now
the
public
school
teacher
and
you
move
him
into
the
parochial
school,
or
you
have
what
the
government
says
is
a
school
within
a
school,
you
are
once
again
lending
the
prestige
of
the
public
school
system
to
everything
that
goes
on
in
the
religious
school,
all
of
the
prayers
and
exercises,
just
as
much
as
when
the
religious
teacher
came
to
the
public
schools.
there
is
no
basic
difference
in
that,
and
if
one
is
aiding
religion,
the
other
is
aiding
it
in
the
same
way.
consider
what
the
court
did
in
meek
and
walman
that
is
unquestioned.
the
court
said
that
the
mere
placing
of
instructional
equipment
and
materials
on
the
premises
of
public
schools
constituted
aid
to
the...
private
schools
constituted
aid
to
those
schools
and
their
religious
mission.
merely
instructional
equipment.
mr.
stanley
geller
i
understand
they
do.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
stanley
geller
the
same
hours
would
be
taught
by
private
school
teachers.
mr.
stanley
geller
they
do
more
than
that.
mr.
stanley
geller
they
do
that,
your
honor,
but
they
do
more
than
that.
mr.
stanley
geller
i
was
coming
to
that,
your
honor.
one
of
the
greatest
aids
that
is
performed
here
is
the
aid
that
the
remedial
school
teacher
gives
to
the
regular
classroom
teacher.
mr.
stanley
geller
it
saves
the
private
schools
a
tremendous
amount
of
money.
i
didn't
argue
that--
mr.
stanley
geller
--in
the
case
of
remedial
instruction
particularly
so.
mr.
stanley
geller
what
you
are
doing
is
taking
the
worst
students
out
of
the
classes
and
allowing
all
of
the
regular
students
to
move
forward.
mr.
stanley
geller
i--
mr.
stanley
geller
--it
is
possible.
there
is
no
evidence
of
that,
your
honor,
but
i
don't
think
that
you
need
any
evidence
to
know
and
to
decide
that
when
you...
just
from
the
very
purpose
and
the
nature
of
the
statute
and
the
program
itself,
you
are
taking
the
worst
students
out
of
their
regular
classes
and
you
are
teaching
them
so
that
they
will
be
able
to
go
back
into
those
classes
and
keep
up
with
the
classes.
mr.
stanley
geller
you
are
not
only
aiding
the
teacher
there,
but
in
respect
of
those
students
you
are
aiding
the
teacher
with
respect
to
every
other
student
in
the
regular
classroom.
mr.
stanley
geller
i
didn't
say
that.
mr.
stanley
geller
absolutely,
your
honor.
mr.
stanley
geller
that's
correct.
and
justice
white--
mr.
stanley
geller
--it
does
not
reduce
the
number
of
teachers,
and
if
it
did
that,
the
government
as
it
is
doing
in
the
kentucky
case
might
go
after
the
religious
schools
and
try
to
get
the
money
back.
i
wasn't
suggesting
that,
but
that
is
not
the
only
aid
that
this
kind
of
program
gives
to
the
religious
schools.
it
is
not
merely
a
question
that
it
enables
them
to
reduce
their
number
of
teachers,
and
we
don't
say
so,
but
it
gives
great--
mr.
stanley
geller
--i
will
tell
you
how
i
think
of
that.
when
you
tell
anybody
in
new
york
city
today,
are
you
aware
that
for
the
last
18
years
there
are
public
school
teachers
teaching
on
the
premises
of
private,
religious
schools,
they
are
aghast,
and
there
is
rarely
a
person
that
does
not
conceive
of
that
as
being
aid
to
the
religious
schools
and
their
mission.
mr.
stanley
geller
it
is
not
perceived...
oh,
your
honor,
by
the
parents
whose
children
are
going
to
the
religious
schools,
it
is
perceived
as
a
program
which
aids
needy
children.
by
the
parents
whose
children
are
going
to
public
schools,
of
course
it
is
perceived
as
aiding
needy
children.
but
what
the
vast,
vast
majority
of
the
citizens
of
new
york
city
do
not
know
is
that
public
school
teachers
are
the
ones
who
are
carrying
the
program
to
the
religious
schools,
and
if
you
ask
me
how
they
perceive
it
on
the
basis
of
my
experience,
i
tell
you
they
perceive
it
as
using
their
tax
dollars
to
support
a
religious
school
with
a
religious
mission,
and
they
are
aghast
when
they
are
told
about
it.
of
course,
the
parents
in
each
type
of
school
know
about
the
program,
but
they
don't
know
about
the
program
in
the
other
schools,
and
they
really
don't
know
how
it
is
being
carried
out.
mr.
stanley
geller
i
don't
think
so,
your
honor.
i
really
don't
think
so,
because
i
don't
think
that
you
have...
and
that
was
my
main
point
when
i
began.
i
don't
think
that
you
have
any
facts
in
this
record
that
can
prove
to
you
that
the
majority
was
wrong
in
meek
against
pittenger
when
it
worried
about
the
potential,
because
there
has
been
no
real
surveillance.
mr.
stanley
geller
i
would
say,
your
honor,
that
it
would
in
effect
be
overruling
meek
against
pittenger
or,
if
i
may,
i
think
it
would
be...
it
would
err
respectfully
in
this
sense,
if
it
took
this
record
and
said
that
this
record
was
proof
that
the
court
had
been
wrong
in
meek
against
pittenger
in
deciding
the
statute
in
that
case
and
in
numerous
other
cases
facially,
because
you
have
no
experience,
you
have
no
experience
in
this
case
other
than
an
experience
which
is
necessarily
based
on
reliance
on
the
good
faith
and
professionalism
of
the
teachers,
which
was
rejected
in
meek,
and
there
is
nothing
in
this
record
that
shows
you
that
you
have
any
more
reason
to
rely
on
the
good
faith
and
professionalism
of
the
teachers
and
guidance
counselors
in
this
case
than
in
meek.
mr.
stanley
geller
thank
you.
