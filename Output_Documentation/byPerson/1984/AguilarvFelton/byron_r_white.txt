justice
white
mr.
solicitor
general,
what
if
it
turns
out
that
the
grand
rapids
program
is
stricken
down
under
the
first
amendment?
what
bearing
do
you
think
that
would
have
on
this
case?
justice
white
you
think
the
title
1
program
is
realistically
distinguishable
from
the
grand
rapids
program
for
constitutional
purposes?
justice
white
on
the
premises
of
private
schools.
justice
white
mr.
geller,
these
classes
go
on
during...
these
remedial
classes
go
on
during
the
regular
school
day,
don't
they?
justice
white
and
i
would
take
it
that
if
they
weren't
going
on
and
weren't
being
paid
for
by
the
title
1
funds,
they
would
be...
the
same
hours
would
be
taught
by
private
school
teachers.
justice
white
and
these
remedial
classes
relieve
the
private
school
of
the
necessity
of
filling
up
those
hours.
justice
white
well,
don't
they?
justice
white
well,
i
know,
but
they...
it
just
means
they
perhaps
don't
have
to
have
as
many
professors.
i
would
think
you
would
argue
that
it
would
be...
that
is
a
direct
aid.
justice
white
it
just
saves...
yes,
but
i
think
it...
wouldn't
it
just
very
likely
save
the
private
school
some
money?
justice
white
even
if
the
private
schools
would
never
put
on
a
course
like
this,
it
nevertheless
would
save
them
money,
because--
justice
white
--but
even
if
they
do
nothing--
justice
white
--well,
i
would
think
if
there
is
x
number
of
hours
a
week
that
you
used
to
have
a
private
school
teacher
to
teach,
if
you
no
longer
have
to
have
a
private
school
teacher
to
teach
those
hours,
you
perhaps
can
get
by
with
a
smaller
staff.
justice
white
there
is
no
evidence
of
that?
