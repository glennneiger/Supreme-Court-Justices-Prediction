mr.

chief
justice

suppose
an
arbitration
agreement
were
drafted
that
all
claims
including
any
possible
claims
under
antitrust
theories
would
be
submitted
to
final
binding
arbitration,
and
went
on
to
provide
that
the
arbitrators
shall
be
three
senior
united
states
judges
or
three
senior
state
supreme
court
justices?
chief
justice
burger
--that
wouldn't
restrain
the
department
of
justice,
would
it?
chief
justice
burger
just
because
the
parties
were
bound
by
the
agreement--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
have
anything
further,
mr.
cross?
chief
justice
burger
well,
then,
the
arbitrators
have
got
to
pass
on
the
credibility
of
the
people.
chief
justice
burger
may
i
ask
you
on
the
procedure,
what
about
discovery
in
an
arbitration?
discovery
is
a
big
part
of
antitrust
litigation.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
