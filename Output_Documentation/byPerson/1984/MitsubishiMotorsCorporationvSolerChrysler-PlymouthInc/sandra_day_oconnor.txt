mr.

justice
o'connor
we
really
have
here
an
international
agreement--
justice
o'connor
--to
deal
with,
and
do
you
think
that
the
court
has
to
necessarily
decide
the
question
about
arbitrability
of
domestic
contracts?
justice
o'connor
mr.
cross--
justice
o'connor
--is
it
very
common
for
manufacturer-dealer
agreements
to
contain
arbitration
clauses?
is
that
a
common
practice?
justice
o'connor
if
you
are
correct
in
this
case,
at
least
as
far
as
international
agreements
are
concerned,
would
the
dealers
ever
get
their
day
in
court
under
the
dealer's
day
in
court
act?
justice
o'connor
i
suppose
that
even
if
the
antitrust
claims
are
arbitrable,
that
it
isn't
binding
on
customers,
it
isn't
binding
on
the
government
antitrust
enforcement
people
as
well.
justice
o'connor
so
there
still
are
mechanisms
in
place--
justice
o'connor
--well,
congress
certainly
never
said
so
expressly,
did
it?
it
passed
the
arbitration
act
after
the
antitrust
act
was
in
place,
and
at
least
it
is
hard
to
find
any
reference
by
congress
to
a
desire
to
exempt
antitrust
actions
from
arbitration.
