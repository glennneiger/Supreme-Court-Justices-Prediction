mr.
jerrold
joseph
ganzfried
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
we
believe
that
the
court
of
appeals
properly
accommodated
the
three
interests
that
are
at
issue
in
this
case,
and
those
interests
are,
one,
the
primacy
of
antitrust
law
in
preserving
our
economic
system
of
free
competition;
two,
the
general
encouragement
of
arbitration
as
a
means
of
resolving
private
disputes;
and
three,
our
commitment
to
an
international
convention
that
requires
enforcement
of
agreements
to
arbitrate
with
very
limited
exceptions.
the
convention
contemplates
that
each
nation
may
withhold
from
arbitration
certain
limited
matters
of
special
national
interest.
it
is
a
safety
valve
in
the
convention,
and
for
the
united
states,
that
exception
covers
antitrust--
now,
it
is
central
to
our
argument
that
the
antitrust
laws
in
the
united
states
are
of
signal
importance.
they
are
designed
to
preserve
competition,
not
just
to
protect
competitors.
they
ensure
the
proper
operation
of
the
free
enterprise
system,
and
because
of
this
systemic
structural
design,
antitrust
claims,
even
private
antitrust
claims,
always
touch
on
the
strong
public
interest
in
competition.
and
it
is
this
factor
that
sets
antitrust
actions
apart
from
other
commercial
disputes.
i
would
like
to
refer
to
a
statement
by
this
court
in
1930
in
the
paramount
famous
lasky
case
in
which
the
court
said
that
not
only
the
prohibitions
of
the
sherman
act
but
the
remedies
which
it
provided
are
coextensive
with
the
broad
conceptions
of
public
policy.
now,
among
the
remedies
that
congress
provided
in
order
to
protect
the
public
interest
is
the
treble
damage
action
in
federal
court.
these
private
actions
have
been
a
vital
part
of
sherman
act
enforcement
for
95
years,
and
it
is
our
position
that
parties
cannot
agree
in
advance
to
cast
aside
that
statutory
remedy.
mr.
jerrold
joseph
ganzfried
we
would
take
the
same
position,
that
that
would
not
be
an
enforceable
agreement.
the
reasons
are
essentially
these:
no
matter
how
qualified,
no
matter
how
experienced
the
arbitrators,
the
fact
is
that
they
are
operating
in
a
system
in
which
there
is
no
substantive
appellate
review,
and
as
this
court
is
quite
familiar...
of
any
legal
decisions
that
they
may
make
on
the
antitrust
issues.
the
arbitrators
also
do
not
have
compulsory
process
which
the
parties
would
be
entitled
to
in
federal
court--
mr.
jerrold
joseph
ganzfried
--the
problem
is
that
if
there
is
an
error
in
the
application
of
the
antitrust
laws,
and
we
are
assuming
now
that
the
arbitration
panel
decides
to
apply
the
american
antitrust
laws,
which
is
not
at
all
certain
in
this
case,
there
is
always
the
possibility
of
error.
mr.
jerrold
joseph
ganzfried
we
say
that
when
the
parties
are
resolving
a
dispute
that
is
essentially
just
between
the
two
of
them,
they
are
perfectly
free
to
do
that,
but
when
it
comes
to
the
antitrust
laws
and
what
they
are
talking
about
is
an
impact
on
competition,
the
public
interest
does
require
that
the
parties
not
discard
that
remedy,
not
discard
the
public
interest
in
advance
on
a
blanket
basis.
well,
i
would
like
to--
mr.
jerrold
joseph
ganzfried
--that's
right,
but
it--
mr.
jerrold
joseph
ganzfried
--not
necessarily.
there
is...
one
answer
to
that
is
that
it
is
always
possible
that
the
arbitrators,
rather
than
applying
the
antitrust
laws
too
leniently,
will
apply
it
too
harshly
and
will
penalize
conduct
that
is
in
fact
procompetitive.
in
that
event,
there
would
be
no
other
party
to
come
in
to
undo
that
damage,
and
you
might
have
a
possibility
of
deterrence
of
the
hard
competition
that
the
antitrust
laws
were
designed
to
promote.
mr.
jerrold
joseph
ganzfried
if
the
conduct
was--
mr.
jerrold
joseph
ganzfried
--but
if
the
arbitrators
had
incorrectly
concluded
that
conduct
was
permissible
under
the
antitrust
laws,
the
department
of
justice
could
bring
an
action.
if
the
arbitrators
had
incorrectly
concluded
that
the
conduct
was
unlawful
when
in
fact
it
was
conduct
that
should
have
been
encouraged,
there
would
be
nothing
for
the
department
of
justice
to
do.
but
in
any
event,
the
design
of
the
public
and
private
attorney
general
enforcement
of
the
antitrust
laws
was
put
in
place
with
the
expectation
and
the
encouragement
of
the
private
actions
as
a
necessary
supplement
to
private...
to
governmental
enforcement.
it
was
not
intended
that
actions
by
the
department
of
justice
be
the
sole
mechanism
for
enforcing
the
antitrust
laws,
and
that
has
not
been
the
case
back
to
1890.
there
is
also
the
possibility
in
these
arbitration
clauses
that
a
manufacturer
could
put
arbitration
clauses
in
its
contracts
with
all
of
its
distributors
and
in
a
fairly
effective
way
immunize
itself
from
the
american
antitrust
laws
because
it
would
now
have
arbitration
clauses
with
all
of
its
direct
purchasers,
so
they
couldn't
bring
an
antitrust
action
in
federal
court.
the
indirect
purchases
would
lack
standing
under
illinois
brick.
and
it
would
be
a
nice,
tidy
buffer
from
the
american
antitrust
laws
that
would
thereby
be
created.
and
that
is
contrary
to
the
public
policy,
that
is
contrary
to
the
primacy
of
the
antitrust
laws
in
our
economic
system.
we
also
think
that
it
is
contrary
to
what
congress
intended
in
the
antitrust
laws
land
in
the
arbitration
laws.
mr.
jerrold
joseph
ganzfried
there
is
no
express
statement
to
that
effect.
as
we
develop
in
the
brief,
the
history
of
the
antitrust
laws
and
the
history
of
the
enforcement
of
the
antitrust
laws
strongly
indicates
that
it
was
not
even
considered
a
remote
possibility
worth
discussing
that
antitrust
actions
would
be
subject
to
arbitration.
there
is
no
suggestion
at
any
point
prior
to
the
american
safety
equipment
case
or
subsequent
to
it
of
any
indication
that
an
american
antitrust
action
had
been
arbitrated
by
anyone
anywhere.
and
certainly,
given
the
antiarbitration
climate
that
existed
in
1890,
we
can
certainly
suggest
that
congress
had
no
intention
of
supplanting
the
enforcement
scheme
that
it
put
in
place
with
an
arbitration
system
that
would
not
be
subject
to
review
on
a
substantive
legal
basis
by
any
court.
we
think
it
is
contrary
to
what
congress
intended
in
1890.
in
1890,
congress
was
combating
companies
that
were
using
contracts
to
restrain
trade,
and
appointed
private
attorneys
general,
gave
them
the
weapon
of
the
treble
damage
action
to
preserve
the
public
interest
and
to
protect
it.
we
think
it
would
be
directly
contrary
to
that
purpose
for
this
court
now
to
disarm
those
private
attorneys
general
and
say
that
companies
could
as
a
matter
of
contract
disarm
the
private
treble
damage
action.
we
have
problems
with
submitting
these
cases
to
arbitration
also
in
terms
of
remedy.
as
it
has
been
mentioned
in
this
case,
it
is
by
no
means
clear
that
swiss
law
interpreting
a
contract
which
is
deemed
by
the
choice
of
law
provision
in
the
contract
to
have
been
entirely
performed
in
switzerland,
would
say
that
american
antitrust
law
is
applicable
to
a
contract
entirely
performed
in
switzerland--
there
is
a
further
shortcoming
with
respect
to
the
particular
arbitration
rules
at
issue
here,
and
that
is
that
we
note
that
under
the
rules
of
the
japanese
commercial
arbitration
association,
the
testimony
that
is
taken
is
not
taken
under
oath.
that,
too,
is
an
important
right
that
a
party
would
have
that
ought
to
be
preserved
in
his
pursuing
his
treble
damage
action.
