but
they
also
maintain
that
it
is
not
within
the
scope
of

justice

you
just
think
there
is
no
merit
to
their
argument.
justice

well,
i
understand,
but
at
least
the
issue
is
before
us,
i
think,
under
their
briefs.
maybe
you--
justice
stevens
i
was
interested
in
that
comment.
you
assume
the
treble
damage
remedy
was
created
in
1914
in
that
case.

1990.

the
private
right
of
action
was
created
in
section
7
of
the
sherman
act,
not
of
the
clayton
act.
i
know
you
say
the
contrary
in
your
brief.
i
think
you
are
quite
wrong--
justice
stevens
--i
suggest
you
reread
the
sherman
act.
justice

what
do
you
say
to
your
opponent's
argument
that
if
it
is
a...
you
had
a
take
it
or
leave
it
situation,
why
did
they
write
an
arbitration
clause
that
wasn't
as
broad
as
they
contended?
it
seems
to
be
somewhat
inconsistent.
justice
stevens
it
would
seem
to
me
that
if
arbitration
in
japan
is
a
great
advantage
to
them,
that
they
would
have
insisted
on
having
all
statutory
claims
arbitrated,
too,
if
they
were
dictating
the
terms.
