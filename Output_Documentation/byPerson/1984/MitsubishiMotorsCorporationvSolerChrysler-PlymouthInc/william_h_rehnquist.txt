justice
rehnquist
at
least
as
capable
as
600
different
federal
district
judges
and
juries
that
serve.
justice
rehnquist
you
say
the
quota
was
1900
and
they
sold...
the
quota
was
1900--
justice
rehnquist
--and
they
sold
4000?
justice
rehnquist
now,
mr.
rodriguez-ramon,
both
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
decided
this
question
against
you,
didn't
they?
justice
rehnquist
so
you
have
a
fairly
hard
row
to
hoe
here
i
would
say--
justice
rehnquist
--in
getting
us
to
change
that.
justice
rehnquist
is
it
your
contention
that
none
of
the
disputes
between
mitsubishi
and
soler
were
subject
to
arbitration?
justice
rehnquist
but
are
there
other
disputes
than
those
you
have
just
mentioned
in
the
case?
justice
rehnquist
and
are
those
subject...
are
those
covered
by
the
arbitration?
justice
rehnquist
then
wouldn't
soler
have
to
go
to
japan
anyway
to
arbitrate
those?
justice
rehnquist
well,
why
is
that
right
that
you
say
the
litigant
has
in
this
proceeding
any
different
than
the
claim
made
in.
alberto
scherk...
or
alberto-culver
v.
scherk?
justice
rehnquist
an
antitrust
claim
is
of
constitutional
rank?
justice
rehnquist
but
the
plaintiff
in
alberto-culver
i
think
could
have
made
that
same
claim,
couldn't
he?
justice
rehnquist
what
is
so
bad
about
having
no
appellate
review?
justice
rehnquist
yes,
but
that's
what
people
bargain
for
in
an
arbitration.
they
say
they
would
rather
have
a
relatively
quick
and
speedy
solution
than
wait
for
the
answer
five
years
later
after
an
appeal.
