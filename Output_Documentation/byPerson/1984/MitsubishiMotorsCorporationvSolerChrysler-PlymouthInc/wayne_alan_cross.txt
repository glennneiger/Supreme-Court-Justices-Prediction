mr.
wayne
alan
cross
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
presents
an
issue
involving
the
tension
between
the
unequivocal
policy
of
the
federal
arbitration
act,
that
all
private
agreements
to
arbitrate
shall
be
enforced
except
in
those
circumstances
where
countervailing
federal
policy
found
in
another
statute
would
create
such
an
exception.
the
tension
is
between
that
policy
and
the
judge-made
policy
initiated
in
the
second
circuit
and
followed
by
four
other
circuits
which
holds
that
antitrust
claims
may
not
be
subject
to
arbitration.
in
dean-witter
v.
byrd
which
was
decided
by
this
court
two
weeks
ago,
the
court
expressed
the
purpose
of
the
federal
arbitration
act
in
precisely
the
terms
that
i
think
are
presented
today.
it
said
"the
preeminent
concern
of
congress
in
passing
the
act
was
to
enforce
private
agreements
into
which
parties
had
entered,
and
that
concern
requires
that
we
rigorously
enforce
agreements
to
arbitrate,
even
if
the
result
is
piecemeal
litigation,
at
least
absent
a
countervailing
policy
manifested
in
another
federal
statute.
"
mitsubishi
in
this
case
submits
that
the
only
issue
before
the
court
is
whether
a
party's
contractual
right
to
arbitrate
antitrust
disputes
can
be
frustrated
absent
such
a
countervailing
federal
policy
found
in
a
federal
statute.
the
issue,
despite
the
plethora
of
briefs
and
issues
raised
in
those
briefs,
the
issue
is
not
what
standard
should
a
court
apply
on
the
enforcement
of
an
arbitral
award,
nor
is
the
issue
the
extent
to
which
an
arbitral
award
on
an
antitrust
claim
would
have
preclusive
effect.
nor
is
the
issue
whether
or
not
antitrust
cases
are
subject
to
arbitration.
now,
the
parties
and
the
courts
agreed
that
under
certain
circumstances
antitrust
cases
can
in
fact
be
arbitrated.
finally,
this
court
is
not
today,
we
believe,
properly
presented
with
questions
of
arbitrability
of
the
puerto
rican
state
franchise
act
or
the
dealers'
day
in
court
act.
i
say
that
because
in
the
current
state
of
this
record,
those
two
claims
have
been
submitted
to
the
japanese
commercial
arbitration
association
by
the
respondent,
not
withdrawn,
and
i
believe
probably
a
decision
with
respect
to
their
arbitrability
on
this
record
is
moot.
thus,
i
think
the
only
issue
that
you
have
to
address
today
is
whether
or
not
mitsubishis
right
to
arbitrate
the
respondent's
counterclaim
against
it
brought
under
the
sherman
act
can
be
frustrated
by
what
has
been
denominated
the
american
safety
doctrine.
mr.
wayne
alan
cross
no,
your
honor,
the
respondent
has
raised
that
issue
in
their
brief
in
response
to
our
brief,
but
the
fact
is
that
the
district
court
and
the
circuit
court
have
both
reviewed
the
scope
of
the
agreement
and
rendered
findings.
mr.
wayne
alan
cross
that's
right.
the
circuit
court
specifically
reviewed
the
question
of
the
scope
of
the
agreement,
affirmed
the
district
court's
decision
that
the
antitrust
claims
reasonably
fell
within
the
scope
of
the
arbitration
agreement--
mr.
wayne
alan
cross
--that's
right,
and
the
way
the
case
comes
to
you
is,
as
the
circuit
court
put
it,
a
question
of
initial
impression,
may
antitrust
cases
be
arbitrated
as
a
matter
of
public
policy.
i
believe
that
is
the
only
issue
presently
before
you.
mr.
wayne
alan
cross
oh,
no,
i'm
saying
i
believe
the
only
issue
before
you
is
may
it
be
arbitrated.
we
are
contending
that
antitrust
cases
can
be
arbitrated.
they
are
clearly
maintaining
that
they
are
not
arbitrable
and
that
all
the
circuit
court--
mr.
wayne
alan
cross
--they
maintain
that.
i--
mr.
wayne
alan
cross
--what
i
am
saying
is
i
don't
think
there's
any
merit,
but
the
circuit
court
and
the
district
court
also
didn't
think
there
was
any
merit.
there
was
a
finding
of
fact
on
that.
mr.
wayne
alan
cross
well,
i--
mr.
wayne
alan
cross
--yes,
there
are.
mr.
wayne
alan
cross
the
question
presented
on
the
cross-petition
does
not
raise
that
issue.
it
is
in
fairness
raised
in
the
brief.
the
question
presented
in
the
cross-petition
is
may...
to
paraphrase
the
cross-petition,
is
may
a
party
be
compelled
to
arbitrate
a
statutory
claim
which
was
passed
for
his
benefit?
there
isn't--
mr.
wayne
alan
cross
--i
suppose
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
wayne
alan
cross
he
presented
to
the
court
below
not
the
issue
that
i
believe
is
presented
in
this
court.
the
issue
that
he
presented
to
the
court
below
is
that
the
words
of
the
arbitration
agreement
were
not
sufficiently
expansive
to
take
in
this
particular
dispute.
mr.
wayne
alan
cross
no,
he's
not
argue...
i
don't
think
he's
arguing
that
here
i
think
what
he
is
arguing
here,
my
recollection
of
what
his
brief
argues
before
you
is
that
in
a
general
arbitration
clause
which
says
disputes
between
the
parties
may
be
arbitrated
cannot
as
a
matter
of
law
be
broad
enough
to
encompass
statutory
claims--
mr.
wayne
alan
cross
--absent
specific
agreement.
what
was
argued
in
the
court
below,
in
both
of
the
courts
below,
was
that
the
words
of
the
arbitration
clause
and
the
description
of
the
disputes
between
the
parties--
mr.
wayne
alan
cross
--were
not
broad
enough
to
take
in
an
antitrust
claim
which
they
said
was
collateral
to
the
contract.
mr.
wayne
alan
cross
the
petitioner
mitsubishi
motors
corporation,
is
a
japanese
manufacturer
of
automobiles.
respondent
soler
chrysler-plymouth
was
a
chrysler
distributor
in
puerto
rico.
because
for
historical
reasons
chrysler
has
had
distribution
rights
to
mitsubishi
vehicles,
it
was
necessary
in
entering...
for
chrysler,
in
entering
into
its
relationship
with
soler,
to
have
an
arrangement
whereby
mitsubishi
and
soler
could
facilitate
orders
and
deliveries
of
vehicles
coming
directly
from
japan.
accordingly,
chrysler,
or
in
fact,
a
subsidiary
of
chrysler,
chrysler
international,
mitsubishi
and
soler
entered
into
what
was
called
a
sales
procedure
agreement.
that
sales
procedure
agreement
has
an
arbitration
clause
providing
for
arbitration
of
certain
disputes
including,
according
to
the
circuit
court,
those
disputes
now
presented
in
japan
for
the
japanese
commercial
arbitration
association.
in
1981
soler's
business
practices
in
effect
destroyed
its
business.
soler
became...
was
placed
in
a
position
where
it
could
not
purchase
cars
from
mitsubishi.
a
series
of
negotiations
ensued
during
which
mitsubishi
offered
to
provide
various
forms
of
alternative
financing
to
assist
in
obtaining
financing,
basically
to
facilitate
a
continuation
of
the
relationship.
soler
refused
to
accept
any
of
the
alternatives
proposed
by
mitsubishi.
at
the
same
time,
soler
failed
to
obtain
financing
itself
to
purchase
cars.
in
the
meantime,
without
financing,
it
ordered
from
mitsubishi
nearly
1000
cars
which
were
manufactured
to
specifications
for
puerto
rico
that
rendered
them
essentially
useless
anywhere
else
in
the
world,
and
finally--
mr.
wayne
alan
cross
--that
was
peculiar
to
standards...
they
were
manufactured
for
unleaded
gas,
which
made
them
virtually
useless
in
the
rest
of
south
america
which
was
predominantly
leaded
gas,
and
they
were
manufactured
without
heaters
and
defoggers,
which
made
them
useless
in
the
continental
united
states,
basically
putting
mitsubishi
in
a
position
that
if
they
didn't
go
to
puerto
rico,
they
didn't
go
anywhere.
at
the
end
of
this,
soler
terminated
its
relationship
with
mitsubishi,
and
it
is
undisputed
in
this
record
that
soler
said
i
don't
want
to
have
anything
else
to
do
with
you.
mmc,
then
being
owed
approximately
$3
million,
requested
arbitration
pursuant
to
the
arbitration
agreement,
and
moved
to
compel
arbitration
pursuant
to
the
federal
arbitration
act
and
the
convention,
in
the
district
court
in
puerto
rico.
soler
responded
somewhat
predictably
by
filing
nine
counterclaims
against
mitsubishi,
including
a
federal
antitrust
claim,
state
antitrust
claim,
a
dealer
day
in
court
act
claim,
and
a
puerto
rican
franchise
act
claim,
so-called
act
75.
soler
also
resisted
arbitration.
the
district
court
ordered
arbitration,
and
soler
took
an
appeal.
the
court
of
appeals
denied
a
petition
for
stay
pending
appeal,
whereupon
soler
submitted
all
of
its
counterclaims
to
arbitration,
paid
the
arbitration
fee,
and
the
arbitration
proceeded.
as
the
arbitration
proceeded
on
all
claims,
including
the
antitrust
claims,
the
appeal
proceeded.
the
first
circuit
decided
that
all
of
the
claims
submitted
by
soler
to
arbitration
should
indeed
proceed
in
the
arbitration,
but
for
the
federal
antitrust
claim,
whereupon
soler
withdrew
the
federal
antitrust
claim,
and
the
case
was
remanded
to
the
district
court.
i
think
that
sequence
is
significant
because
what
soler
did
not
do
is
withdraw
either
the
act
75
claim
or
the
dealer's
day
in
court
act
claim
at
that
time.
the
circuit
court,
in
reversing,
found...
rested
solely
upon
the
american
safety
doctrine.
the
circuit
court,
as
i
indicated
before,
found
that
the
arbitration
agreement
was
broad
enough
to
encompass
these
antitrust
disputes,
affirmed
the
referenced
arbitration
of
all
other
counterclaims
and
mitsubishi's
claims,
and
held
that
but
for
the
american
safety
doctrine,
the
doctrine
that
says
that
as
a
matter
of
public
policy,
antitrust
cases
are
too
important
to
be
submitted
to
arbitral
panels,
it
would
have
affirmed
it
with
respect
to
that.
we
submit
that
the
circuit
court's
reliance
upon
the
american
safety
case
is
fundamentally
at
odds
with
the
purpose
of
the
federal
arbitration
act.
as
this
court
has
repeatedly
stated,
and
within
the
last
three
terms
in
moses
cone,
southland,
dean-witter
and
a
few
other
cases,
there
is
a
strong,
unequivocal
policy
in...
federal
policy
in
favor
of
arbitration.
that
policy,
as
the
court
said
in
dean-witter,
leaves
no
place
for
the
exercise
of
discretion
by
the
district
court
but
instead
mandates
that
district
courts
shall
direct
the
parties
to
proceed
to
arbitration
on
issues
as
to
which
there
is
an
arbitration
agreement.
mr.
wayne
alan
cross
yes.
mr.
wayne
alan
cross
yes.
mr.
wayne
alan
cross
in
the
context
that
this
case
is
presented
to
this
court,
i
believe
you
do.
i
should
say
i
believe
there
are
grounds
on
which
you
could
decide
this
without
confronting
that
issue,
but
the
circuit
court's
rationale
for
submitting...
for
reversing
the
district
court
and
refusing
to
permit
arbitration
was
that
under
the
convention,
the
convention
on
the
recognition
and
enforcement
of
foreign
arbitral
awards,
under
the
convention
it
found
an
exception
to
the
mandatory
nature
of
the
convention,
and
that
exception
was
in
the
clause
of
article
2
of
the
convention
that
requires
that
an
agreement
shall
be
submitted
to
arbitration
unless
it
is
a
matter
which
is
not
capable
of
settlement
by
arbitration.
it
seized
on
that
language
and
took
the
american
safety
case
and
said
that
represents
a
policy
of
the
united
states
which
makes
it
not
capable
for
resolution
by
arbitration.
in
that
context,
to
at
least
reserve
it
in
the
terms
the
circuit
court
cited,
i
believe
you
do
have
to
address
that
issue.
mr.
wayne
alan
cross
yes,
i
do,
your
honor.
mr.
wayne
alan
cross
your
honor,
i
have
to
say
as
much
as
i
would
like
to
say
no,
you
can't,
i
believe
you
could
decide
this
case
on
the
basis
of
scherk,
that
the
decision
in
scherk,
if
applied
to
the
antitrust
laws,
or
if
applied
to
american
safety
in
the
same
way
that
scherk
was
applied
to
wilko,
if
the
four
corners
of
the
square
were
filled
in,
i
believe
you
could
decide
that
issue--
mr.
wayne
alan
cross
--well,
that's
right.
mr.
wayne
alan
cross
no,
but
i
submit
that
if
you
were
to
decide
to
do
the
same
thing
in
american
safety--
mr.
wayne
alan
cross
--well,
that's
right.
i
did
not
read
scherk
as
overruling...
as
overruling
wilko
so
much
as
a
limitation
on
wilko
in
international
conduct.
i
believe
you
could
decide
it
that
way,
yes.
mr.
wayne
alan
cross
no,
it's
not.
the
federal
arbitration
act,
as
you
found
in
dean-witter
and
in
southland
last
term,
has
only
two
exceptions
from
its
coverage.
the
first
is
that
the
contract
must
be
in
commerce,
and
i
don't
think
there's
any
question
about
that.
the
other
is
that
it
must
be...
it
may
be
revocable
only
upon
grounds
as
exist
for
revocation
of
any
contract
such
as
fraud
or
duress.
mr.
wayne
alan
cross
yes.
mr.
wayne
alan
cross
it
is
certainly...
i
can't
speak
to
the
domestic
context,
your
honor.
it
certainly
is
in
the
international
context.
it
is
because
of
the
tensions
and
the
differing
cultural
backgrounds,
the
reference
to
arbitration
is
considered,
as
this
court
indicated
in
scherk
and
bremen,
is
considered
to
be
an
important
facet
of
international
commerce.
mr.
wayne
alan
cross
your
honor,
both
with
respect
to
the
dealer's
day
in
court
act
and
with
respect
to
the
antitrust
claims,
it's
our
contention
that
an
arbitral
panel
is
simply
an
alternative
form.
we
do
not
understand
or
certainly
accept
the
proposition
that
federal
statutory
claims
cannot
be
adjudicated
by
arbitrators.
all
right,
i
should
really
state
it.
i
think
that
the
position
of
the
solicitor
general
is
that
either
they
will
not
be
considered
or
cannot
adequately
be
considered,
and
we
reject
both
of
those
contentions.
my
experience
and
the
experience
of
the
law
with
arbitration
is
that
arbitrators
will
in
fact
take
antitrust
claims.
this
case
is
a
good
example.
soler
submitted
his
antitrust
claims
to
the
japanese
commercial
arbitration
association.
mitsubishi
did
not
object
to
that.
the
japanese
commercial
arbitration
association
accepted
jurisdiction
to
determine
it.
the
only
reason
that
the
arbitration
association
is
not
now
deciding
that
case
is
because
soler
withdrew
it
from
its
jurisdiction.
the--
mr.
wayne
alan
cross
--your
honor,
my...
yes,
i
believe
so.
i
believe
that
if
the
arbitrator
clearly
stated
that
he,
notwithstanding
the
submission
of
the
parties...
i
mean,
arbitral
jurisdiction
is
determined
by
the
submission
of
the
parties,
notwithstanding
the
submission
of
both
parties
that
the
arbitrator
should
decide
the
antitrust
issues
according
to
american
law,
which
is
the
context
that
we
have
in
this
case,
if
he
said,
notwithstanding
that
submission,
i
refuse--
mr.
wayne
alan
cross
--well,
in
that...
well,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
in
this
case
what
the
district
court
did
was
to
dismiss
the
antitrust
claim
because
of
the
existence
of
the
arbitration
agreement.
soler
thereafter
did
file
a
complaint,
an
antitrust
complaint
before
the
arbitrators,
and
we
consented
to
the
filing
of
that
complaint.
mr.
wayne
alan
cross
there
is
a
choice
of
law
provision.
the
amicus
brief
filed
on
behalf
of
the
commonwealth
of
puerto
rico
addressed
that.
the
choice
of
law
provision
in
these
contracts...
there
are
two
contracts...
indicates
that
swiss
law
should
be
applied.
mr.
wayne
alan
cross
your
honor,
i
think
an
arbitrator
could
do
that.
i
think
it
might--
mr.
wayne
alan
cross
--partly
because
of
the
submission
of
the
parties,
if
the
parties
submit
the
issue,
the
arbitrator
is
not
limited
to
the
issues--
mr.
wayne
alan
cross
--but
secondly,
i
think
that--
mr.
wayne
alan
cross
--under
swiss
law.
mr.
wayne
alan
cross
the...
if
mitsubishi
said
that,
there
are
really
two
hypotheticals.
one
is
if
the
arbitrators
did
it
sua
sponte,
and
the
other
is
if
mitsubishi
did
it.
mr.
wayne
alan
cross
i
believe
that
the
practical
result
of
mitsubishi
having
obtained
an
order
to
compel
arbitration
of
the
antitrust
claim,
then
went
to
the
arbitrators
and
said
there
is
no
antitrust
claim
available
in
the
arbitration,
i
suspect
it
would
be
estopped
and
we
would
see
soler
back
in
the
district
court
in
puerto
rico
filing
a
new
antitrust
claim
very
rapidly.
mr.
wayne
alan
cross
well,
your
honor,
two
points.
first
of
all,
we
started
the
action
seeking
an
arbitration.
they
counterclaimed,
and
we
moved
to
compel
arbitration
of
their
counterclaims.
second,
we
did
move
to
dismiss,
but
on
the
merits
of
the
antitrust
claims.
thirdly,
it
is
not
at
all
clear...
and
i
should
be
candid,
we
do
not
have
an
opinion
of
swiss
counsel
in
the
record,
but
it
is
not
at
all
clear
that
under
swiss
law
that
the
united
states
antitrust
claims
would
not
be
given
cognizance.
swiss
law
could
apply
to
this
dispute
in
two
different
ways,
with
respect
to
the
contract
claims,
the
claims
could
be
decided
under
swiss
substantive
law.
with
respect
to
claims
outside
the
contracts
but
related
to
them,
swiss
choice
of
law
provisions
would
probably
apply,
and
it
is
not
at
all
clear
that
under
swiss
choice
of
law
provisions
a
tort
or
an
action
in
the
nature
of
tort
such
an
antitrust
claim
would
not
be...
united
states
law
would
not
be
applied
to
that.
mr.
wayne
alan
cross
well,
we
did
certainly
decide
we
would
rather
arbitrate
it.
mr.
wayne
alan
cross
the
federal
arbitration
act
has,
of
course,
been
limited
in
certain
circumstances.
for
example,
the
arbitration
act
itself
contains
certain
exemptions
for
labor
related
disputes.
the
fact
that
there
isn't
an
exemption
for
antitrust
claims
in
the
arbitration
act
is
itself
significant,
i
believe,
in
that
the
clayton
act
establishing
the
private
right
of
action
under
the
antitrust
laws
was
passed
some
ten
years
before
the
arbitration
act,
and
the
arbitration
act...
or
the
congress,
in
enacting
the
arbitration
act,
did
not
see
fit
to
create
an
exemption
for
antitrust
claims.
secondly--
mr.
wayne
alan
cross
--no,
the
private
right
of
action,
your
honor.
i
think
the--
mr.
wayne
alan
cross
--that's
right.
mr.
wayne
alan
cross
that
was
not
my
understanding--
mr.
wayne
alan
cross
--all
right.
the...
this
court
has
also
created
and
found
exceptions
to
the
federal
arbitration
act,
most
notably
in
wilko,
and
in
every
instance
where
an
exception
from
the
arbitration
act
has
been
found
by
this
court,
it
has
been
in
the
context
of
finding
an
expression
of
congressional
intent
in
another
federal
statute.
that
is
the
proper
inquiry,
we
submit.
as
this
court
said
in
dean-witter
two
weeks
ago,
absent
a
countervailing
policy
found
in
another
federal
statute,
the
arbitration
act
is
mandatory.
the
exercise
that
the
lower
courts
have
engaged
in
in
finding
a
public
policy
exception
in
their
own
reading
of
the
importance
of
the
antitrust
laws
we
believe
is
an
usurpation
of
congressional
power
and
is
inconsistent
with
the
decisions
of
this
court
addressing
that.
briefly,
the
american
safety...
you
asked
me
earlier
whether
or
not
i
thought
the
american
safety
doctrine
should
be
overruled.
clearly
we
do.
first,
we
believe
it
is
an
usurpation
of
power.
secondly,
the
policy
balance
struck
we
suggest
is
wrong,
that
the
concern
expressed
by
the
second
circuit
in
the
american
safety
and
the
concern
expressed
by
the
solicitor
general
in
this
case
that
somehow
the
antitrust
laws
will
not
be
adequately
enforced
simply
flies
in
the
face
of
the
experience
that
we
have
had
with
arbitration
over
the
last
50
years.
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
arbitrators
will
take
disputes
of
this
nature.
they
have
been
willing
to
do
it
in
the
past.
with
the
increasing
trend
toward
international
arbitration,
more
and
more
cases
of
greater
and
greater
complexity
are
being
submitted.
mr.
wayne
alan
cross
yes,
it
was
a
good
panel.
the
second...
and
what
i
think,
what
i
suspect
is
at
the
core
of
the
suspicion
that
the
american
safety
court
and
its
progeny
and
the
solicitor
general
in
this
case
has
toward
arbitration
of
antitrust
cases
is
really
a
suspicion
that
arbitrators
somehow
will
not
be
objective
or
competent
to
handle
a
problem,
and
i
submit
that
the...
as
detailed
in
the
amicus
brief
of
the
international
chamber
of
commerce,
the
decrease
of
sophistication
that
arbitrators
bring
to
these
arbitrations,
the
complex
issues
that
they
handle
on
a
routine
basis
makes
them
perfectly
capable
of
arbitrating
complex
or
simple
antitrust
cases.
mr.
wayne
alan
cross
your
honor,
i
couldn't
have
said
it
better
myself.
the
world
is
imperfect,
but
three
arbitrators
sitting
in
paris
under
the
auspices
of
the
international
chamber
of
commerce
or
sitting
in
japan,
three
law
professors
sitting
in
japan
i
submit
are
more
likely
to
give
perfect
credence
to
the
antitrust
laws
than
six
jurors,
however
well
instructed.
the
limits
on
instruction--
mr.
wayne
alan
cross
--there
are
suggestions
throughout
the
briefs
that
it
is.
there
has
never
been
a
claim
presented
in
either
lower
court
that
it
is.
the
evidence
that
is
in
the
record
suggests
the
contrary.
for
example,
there
are
two
contracts
here,
one
between
soler
and
chrysler,
which
was
the
primary
dealer
relationship.
soler
was
primarily
a
chrysler
dealer.
he
incidentally
sold
mitsubishi
cars.
in
the
chrysler-soler
relationship
there
is
no
arbitration
clause.
the
arbitration
clause
exists
only
in
the
mitsubishi-soler
relationship.
i
submit
that
if
this
was
a
contract
of
adhesion
imposed
on
soler
by
mitsubishi
and
chrysler
acting
jointly,
that
it
would
not
have
been
so
limited.
secondly,
the
suggestion
that
it
is
a
contract
of
adhesion
is
belied
by
the
respondent's
own
arguments
where
in
the
context
of
arguing
both
in
the
lower
court
and
now
in
this
court
slightly
different
arguments,
that
somehow
the
arbitration
clause
was
narrowed,
was
not
broad
enough...
in
the
lower
court
they
argued
that
it
wasn't
broad
enough
to
encompass
these
particular
factual
disputes,
in
this
court
they
argue
that
it
is
not
broad
enough
to
encompass
statutory
claims,
that
is
a
peculiar
argument
in
the
context
of
arguing
that
the
clause
was
imposed
by
defendant
seeking
to
avoid
liability.
if
anything,
it
would
have...
the
broadest
possible
clause
would
have
been
imposed.
the
fact
is
these
agreements
were
freely
negotiated
agreements,
and
according
to
the
federal
arbitration
act
and
the
convention
we
submit
should
be
enforced.
i
would
like
to
reserve
some
time
for
rebuttal.
the
final
comment
that
i
would
make
at
this
point
is
that
leaving
aside
the...
leaving
aside
the
american
safety
doctrine,
the
federal
arbitration
act
and
the
convention,
i
believe
this
court
must
reverse
the
lower
court
solely
based
on
scherk.
read
most
charitably,
the
circuit
court's
decision
with
respect
to
our
scherk
argument
is
that
the
securities
laws
simply
aren't
as
important
as
the
antitrust
laws,
that
this
court
was
prepared
to
limit
its
own
holding
in
wilko
in
the
international
context
but
should
not
be
willing
to
limit
the
second
circuit's
holding
in
american
safety
to
the
domestic
context
because
the
securities
laws
at
stake
in
wilko
were
somehow
not
as
important
as
the
antitrust
laws
at
stake
here.
we
submit
that
the
language
of
the
united
states
v.
naftalin
conclusively
rebuts
that
argument.
the
fact
is
the
securities
laws
were
passed
in
order
to
restore
integrity
to
the
financial
markets
and
the
economy
of
this
country.
they
do
incidentally
protect
individual
investors,
there
is
no
question
about
that,
but
they
go
as
much
to
the
fabric
of
this
nation's
economy
as
the
antitrust
laws
do,
we
submit,
and
the
attempt
to
distinguish
scherk
on
that
ground
cannot
stand.
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time
for
a
short
rebuttal
if
possible.
mr.
wayne
alan
cross
would
you
comment
at
some
point
on
that
last
point,
the
absence
of
the
oath
taking?
your
honor,
i
can't.
i
know
that's
in
the
rules,
but
other
than...
evidence
is
submitted
both
in
writing
and
orally
before
the
panel,
but
it
may
be
that
the
oath
taking
process
has
something
to
do
with
the
culture
of
japan
where
taking
an
oath
doesn't
have
quite
the
significance
that
it
does
here
in
the
sense
that--
mr.
wayne
alan
cross
--i
think
the
arbitrators
do,
your
honor.
i
think
the
point
that
the
solicitor
general
makes
primarily
is...
i
think
is
a
straw
man.
it
is
setting
up
the
proposition
that
the
antitrust
laws
will
not
be
enforced
in
an
arbitration
context,
and
that
simply
flies
in
the
fact
of
the
arbitral
process
itself.
but
what
an
arbitration
agreement
does
do
to
an
antitrust
claim
is
require
that
it
be
adjudicated
in
a
different
forum
according
to
different
procedures
freely
agreed
to
by
the
parties.
i
believe
that's
what
the
federal
arbitration
act
and
the
convention
contemplates.
secondly,
the
suggestion
that--
mr.
wayne
alan
cross
--the
discovery
in
our
arbitration
proceedings
before
the
various
arbitration
associations
is
left
largely
to
the
discretion
of
the
arbitrators
themselves,
and
in
practice,
that
means
largely
to
the
discretion
of
the
parties.
there
is
no
doubt
that
an
arbitrator
or
a
panel
of
arbitrators
can
say
we
simply
won't
permit
discovery.
the
practice
before
most
of
the
major
arbitration
associations
is
that
the
parties
attempt
to
agree
upon
the
scope.
there
is,
to
be
sure,
a
limitation
on
compulsory
discovery
at
least
with
respect
to
tribunals
sitting
overseas.
tribunals
sitting
in
the
united
states,
of
course,
can't
avail
themselves
of
the
domestic
courts,
and
for
example,
they
issue
subpoenas.
the
suggestion
by
the
solicitor
general
that
antitrust
cases
cannot
be
effectively
adjudicated
in
arbitration
is
of
course
belied
by
the
fact
that
in
an
after-dispute
clause,
apparently
everybody
agrees
it
is
perfectly
appropriate
to
adjudicate
antitrust
disputes,
and
that
the
law
and
the
nonappealability
issues
do
not
seem
to
bother
anybody,
including
the
solicitor
general
in
that
context.
more
significantly,
however,
is
that
the
convention
was
passed,
was
adopted
and
ratified
by
this
nation
in
order
to
implement
the
kind
of
uniformity
and
certainty
in
the
international
scene
that
was
discussed
in
bremen
and
in
scherk,
that
for
international
business
to
thrive,
it
is
necessary
that
people
of
different
cultural
and
legal
background
with
natural
suspicion
have
uniformity.
