mr.
benjamin
rodriguez-ramon
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
presents
before
the
court
the
question
as
to
whether
a
federal
district
court
in
san
juan,
puerto
rico
or
an
arbitration
panel
in
tokyo,
japan
is
the
appropriate
forum
to
adjudicate
controversies
that
appear
in
an
action.
counterclaims
filed
before
the
district
court
in
san
juan
under
the
united
states
antitrust
statute,
under
the
automobile
dealer's
day
in
court
statute,
under
the
puerto
rican
act
75
statute
approved
by
the
puerto
rican
legislature
for
the
protection
of
local
distributors,
and
under
the
local
antitrust
statute.
the
matter
develops
in
the
context
of
a
distribution
agreement
executed
between
three
parties,
chrysler
international,
s.
a.
corpcisa,
that's
the
wholly
owned
subsidiary
of
chrysler
motor
corporation,
mitsubishi
motor
corporation,
a
subsidiary
of
mitsubishi
heavy
industries,
and
partly
of
chrysler
motor
corporation,
and
soler
chrysler-plymouth,
a
puerto
rican
dealer,
engaged
in
the
sale,
distribution
and
sale
in
puerto
rico
of
automobiles.
basically,
the
facts
as
described
by
mr.
cross
are
correct
except
with
regard
to
a
few
particular
areas.
for
instance,
this
is
a
contract
that
is
executed
back
in
october
31,
1979,
for
the
distribution
of
automobiles,
and
immediately
after
execution
the
grantor
or
manufacturer
imposes
so-called
minimum
sales
volume
for
the
year
1982
in
the
order
of
1900
vehicles,
more
or
less.
soler
surpasses
that
quota
extensively
during
that
year.
soler
sells
more
than
4000
vehicles.
it
made
out
to
mitsubishi
for
the
following
year--
mr.
benjamin
rodriguez-ramon
--1992,
sir.
mr.
benjamin
rodriguez-ramon
over
4000,
yes.
for
the
following
year,
mitsubishi,
induced
by
the
idea
that
soler
was
selling
a
lot
of
automobiles
in
puerto
rico
and
creating
a
substantial
market,
increased
that
quota
to
4,750
automobiles,
236
percent.
despite
that,
soler
tried
to
comply
with
the
quota
and
ordered,
in
its
enthusiasm
to
sell
more
car,
ordered
more
cars
possibly
than
it
should
have
ordered.
by
the
year
1981
it
so
happened
that
the
market
in
puerto
rico
was
extremely
soft
for
this
type
of
vehicle,
and
then
soler
had
to
do
something.
soler
could
not
pay
for
the
cars
just
on
the
basis
of
relying
on
sales
in
puerto
rico
because
the
market
was
very,
very
bad
for
sales
of
automobiles
in
puerto
rico
during
that
year.
soler
tried
to
convince
mitsubishi
repeatedly,
and
in
this
end,
enlisted
the
aid
of
the
different
other
two
dealers
in
puerto
rico
in
order
that
mitsubishi
would
permit
transshipment
to
the
united
states
or
to
south
america.
the
theory
of
soler
was
that
the
other
importers
of
japanese
vehicles,
to
wit,
toyota,
nissan,
etcetera,
were
authorized
to
divert
to
the
continental
united
states
and
in
fact
did
divert,
and
it
so
appeared
in
the
record,
substantial
amounts
of
cars.
originally
mitsubishi
took
the
position
that
they
could
not
agree
because
this
was,
and
i
quote,
"an
issue
with
a
tint
of
political
complications.
"
july
1981.
again
soler
tried
to
convince
mitsubishi,
and
this
time
it
was
not
mitsubishi
but
chrysler
motor
corporation,
chrysler
corporation,
that
answered
in
a
telex
that
they
could
not
agree
because
they
had
agreed
with
mitsubishi
to
divide
markets,
to
allocate
markets
and
so
certain
dealers
order
on
the
basis
of
so-called
negotiated
volumes.
soler
kept
insisting
with
mitsubishi
and
with
chrysler,
eventually
received
an
order
from
mitsubishi
sometime
in
september
1981
to
the
effect
that
every
effort
concerning
the
possibility
of
transshipment
had
to
be
stopped
by
soler,
and
reiterated
that
there
were
agreements
between
chrysler,
chrysler
international
also,
and
between
mitsubishi,
that
prevented
this
type
of
transshipment.
by
then
and
not
by
its
counterclaim
in
the
federal
court,
by
then,
february
1982,
soler
for
the
first
time,
for
the
first
time
indicated
in
writing
to
mitsubishi
that
this
was
in
restraint
of
trade
and
it
was
against
the
law.
that
happened,
for
our
justices,
that
happened
a
few
months
before
the
filing
of
the
action
by
mitsubishi
before
the
federal
district
court
in
puerto
rico.
mitsubishi
filed
to
compel
arbitration.
soler
answered
and
counterclaimed
on
various
grounds.
the
district
court
in
puerto
rico
heard
argument
on
both
sides
and
decided
that
all
the
claims
involved
in
this
proceeding
were
arbitrable
and
had
to
be
arbitrated
before
the
arbitration
panel
in
japan.
on
this
occasion,
soler
took
an
appeal
to
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
first
circuit.
in
that
occasion,
as
also
as
it
did
in
the
lower
court,
soler
insisted,
among
other
particulars,
that
the
clause
involved
in
this
proceeding
was
narrow.
in
fact,
the
court
of
appeals
addresses
that
issue
specifically
because
of
the
fact
that
it
was
addressed
on
appeal,
and
it
said,
and
i
quote,
its
opinion,
soler
answers
that
it
never
specifically
agreed
to
arbitrate
controversies
that
arose
under
such
statutes
as
the
sherman
act,
etcetera.
so
i
believe
that
it
should
be
very
clear
that
from
the
outset,
we
did
argue
that
this
was
a
narrow
clause,
that
it
did
not
encompass
the
different
claims
that
we
are
talking
about
today,
and
that
it
was
limited
to
certain
controversies
that
appeared
from
the
clause
itself,
to
wit,
controversies
under
paragraph
1
to
5,
1(b)
to
5,
which
has
controversies
that
have
nothing
to
do
with
statutory
claims
to
this
court.
mr.
benjamin
rodriguez-ramon
yes,
that's
correct.
mr.
benjamin
rodriguez-ramon
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
benjamin
rodriguez-ramon
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
but
i
believe
when
they
decided
that
issue
against
us,
they
were
wrong,
and
i
will
tell
the
court
why,
most
respectfully.
we
are
aware
of
the
policy
of
this
honorable
court
in
favor
of
arbitration.
in
fact,
arbitration
is
an
method
that
is
supposed
to
be
simple,
inexpensive
for
the
revolution
of
different
controversies.
likewise,
we
do
realize,
do
realize
that
arbitration
is
a
method
that
promotes
judicial
efficiencies,
particularly
in
these
days
when
judicial
resources
are
so
scarce.
however,
however,
even
though
we
believe
that
that's
a
salutory
policy,
we
believe
that
it
should
not
go
beyond
the
policy
itself.
in
other
words,
the
mere
fact
that
arbitration
agreements
are
to
be
construed
liberally
does
not
necessarily
mean
that
they
should
be
construed
in
such
a
way
as
to
encompass
particulars
and
conditions
and
terms
that
the
parties
did
not
agree
to
arbitrate.
in
particularly
this
case,
this
is
very
important
because
the
arbitration,
it
so
happened,
is
suppose
to
take
place
about
9000
miles
from
puerto
rico
in
japanese...
and
i
don't
have
any
problem
with
the
language
except
for
the
cost
that
it
entails
for
our
time.
it
entails
going
to
japan
himself
with
his
american
attorneys.
it
entails
having
translators.
it
entails
transporting
from
puerto
rico
not
only
documentary
evidence,
but
accountants,
witnesses,
extra
witnesses.
it
means
that
mr.
soler
will
have
to
engage
in
all
this
costly
litigation
in
japan,
and
by
the
way,
let
me
point
to
the
court
that
at
this
stage
soler
chrysler-plymouth
is
a
chapter
11
debtor
before
the
bankruptcy
court
of
puerto
rico.
but
going
back
to
the
closest
panel
or
not,
this
court
has
stated
that
arbitration
is
a
matter
of
contract,
and
a
party
cannot
be
required
to
submit
to
arbitration
in
a
dispute
which
it
has
not
agreed
so
to
submit.
these
facts
have
been
reiterated
also
by
lower
courts,
circuit
and
district.
mr.
benjamin
rodriguez-ramon
that
is
correct.
we
say
that
none
of
the
disputes
under
the
antitrust
statutes,
under
the
automobile
dealers'
statute,
under
act
75,
under
our
local
antitrust
statutes,
were
even
considered
by
mitsubishi
a
possible
avenue.
mr.
benjamin
rodriguez-ramon
yes,
sir.
mr.
benjamin
rodriguez-ramon
yes,
sir.
mr.
benjamin
rodriguez-ramon
not
necessarily,
your
honor,
not
necessarily,
because
we
believe
that
the
facts
are
so
intertwined...
and
i
know
i
am
going
to
be
faced
with
dean-witter,
but
the
problem
that
we
have
with
the
nonapplicability
of
dean-witter
is
that
dean-witter
s
an
action
solely
under
the
securities
act
in
regard
to
a
claim
under
common
law
principles.
in
other
words,
this
honorable
court
distinguished
two
types
of
claims
there,
and
in
fact,
the
defendant
there
did
not
move
for
arbitration
concerning
the
securities
action
because
that
was...
wilko
was
applied.
the
wilko
case
prevented
the
defendant
in
that
occasion
from
moving
to
arbitration.
the
defendant
only
moved
for
knowledge
on
the
common
law
claim
and
not
on
the
securities
claim
because
they
said
that
the
two
could
continue
at
the
same
time,
and
the
other
one
could
not
necessarily...
unnecessarily,
is
not
necessarily
precluded
in
terms
of
the
adjudicated
of
its
facts
in
the
securities
claim.
we
say
that
this
clause
was
inserted
in
the
contract
by
mitsubishi,
in
a
printed
contract
by
mitsubishi
executed
in
japan
in
where
there
was
no
negotiation.
i
don't
believe,
and
i
disagree
with
my
brother
mr.
cross,
when
he
state
that
there
were
negotiations,
negotiations
leading
to
the
contract.
this
is
a
printed
contract.
this
is
a
printed
contract
in
which
soler
was
faced...
with
which
soler
was
faced
when
he
was
in
japan
in
a
take
it
or
leave
it
situation.
soler
wanted
to
distribute
mitsubishi's
automobiles
in
puerto
rico.
in
fact,
puerto
rico
is
a
very
good
market
for
small
cars,
and
soler
wanted
to
take
advantage
of
that.
however,
there
were
no
negotiations
that
could
lead
to
the
possibility
of
an
arm's
length
transaction
as
happening.
mr.
benjamin
rodriguez-ramon
i
believe
they
wrote
a
very
narrow
arbitration
clause,
your
honor,
intendedly.
they
could
never
imagine
that
two
courts
of
the
united
states,
the
district
court
in
puerto
rico
and
a
separate
court
of
appeals
in
boston,
could
interpret
that
clause
to
the
extent
that
it
was
interpreted
by
those
two
courts.
i
believe
that
mitsubishi
only
considered,
only
considered
the
possibility
of
arbitrating
commercial
contractual
controversy.
the
best
evidence
of
that
is
that
mitsubishi
in
the
clause
itself
explicitly
states
the
paragraphs
that
are
covered
in
regard
to
the
controversies.
another
evidence
of
that
is
that
for
ease
of
determination
that
appears
in
paragraph
7
is
not
included
between
1
and
5.
other
particulars,
if
the
contract
is
examined,
will--
mr.
benjamin
rodriguez-ramon
--i
agree,
sir,
but
they
did
not.
but
they
did
not.
mr.
benjamin
rodriguez-ramon
they
probably
did
not
have
that
in
mind,
and
they
probably
could
never
imagine
that
two
courts
in
the
united
states
could
decide
in
their
favor.
but
let's
assume,
let's
assume
arguendo,
let's
assume
arguendo
that
the
clause
is
ample.
let's
assume
that
it
is
not
as
narrow
as
we
believe
it
is.
even
so,
even
so,
we
respectfully
submit
that
all
these
four
claims
are
not
suitable
for
arbitration.
this
honorable
court
has
recognized
on
various
occasions
that
there
are
differences
between
so-called
statutory
claims
and
contractual
claims.
examples
of
that
are
the
cases
of
alexander
in
the
civil
rights
act
context,
the
case
of
barrentine
in
the
fair
labor
standards
act
context,
claims
under
the
securities
act
of
1973...
wilko
is
just
one...
and
of
course,
lower
court
cases
to
the
effect
that
antitrust
actions
and
during
complex...
with
the
possibilities
of
arbitration
that
the
federal
arbitration
act
contemplated,
the
court
in
the
american
safety
referred
to
this
type
of
claim
as
statutory
claim.
it
utilized
the
same
wording
that
the
supreme
court
has
utilized
in
these
other
cases.
why
is
it
so?
i
believe
it
is
important
to
signify
before
the
court
that
this
trend
of
distinguishing
between
statutory
and
contractual
claims
is
a
recognition
that
this
court
has
given
to
serious
and
important
public
policies
approved
by
congress.
for
instance,
civil
rights
litigation,
this
honorable
court
has
considered
that
civil
rights
claims
should
be
tried
before
a
court
and
not
before
arbitrators,
and
if
they
are
tried
before
arbitrators,
they
do
not
have
neither
collateral
nor
effect
in
the
court
action;
fair
labor
standards
act
litigation,
and
things
of
this
sort.
we
respectfully
submit
also
that
both
the
convention
and
the
federal
arbitration
act
allow
for
this
type
of
distinction.
the
federal
arbitration
act
in
paragraph
2
states
that
this
type
of
contract
can
be
enforced
if
they
have
an
arbitration
clause
except
upon
such
grounds
as
exist
at
law
or
in
equity
for
the
revocation
of
any
contract.
the
same
thing
can
be
said
about
the
convention.
the
convention
has
similar
language
that
was
not
utilized
by
the
honorable
judge
coffin
upon
resolving
that
the
antitrust
claims
exercised
by
soler
could
be
exercised
in
the
judicial
forum.
finally,
in
terms
of
antitrust
litigation,
what
are
we
talking
about?
an
antitrust
litigant
in
this
country
has
a
right
to
litigate
before
a
court
and
before
his
peers.
he
is
entitled
to
have
a
trial
by
jury.
he
is
entitled
to
be
heard
by
12
of
his
peers
concerning
whether
the
defendant
has
committed,
has
so
committed
a
restraint
of
trade.
and
that--
mr.
benjamin
rodriguez-ramon
--well,
in
this
case,
your
honor,
in
this
case,
this
claim
is
of
the
constitutional
rank.
so
this
honorable
court
said
in--
mr.
benjamin
rodriguez-ramon
--no,
no,
litigation
of
an
antitrust
claim
before
a
district
court,
u.s.
district
court,
and
before
a
jury,
the
mere
fact
that
the
complainant
has
a
right
to
be
heard
by
a
jury
and
to
adjudication
through
a
remedy
by
a
jury
has
constitutional
rank?
mr.
benjamin
rodriguez-ramon
yes,
yes.
the
only
difference
i
see
with
alberto-culver
in
this
case
is
that
in
that
case
you
had
a
truly
international
agreement.
in
this
case
you
may
say
that
this
contract
looks
like
an
international
agreement,
sir.
however,
this
honorable
court
explained
what
did
it
mean
in
characterizing
as
international
the
contract
involved
in
the
case
of
scherk.
for
instance,
the
court
said
you
need
two
nationals,
one
from...
a
foreign
national
and
an
american
national.
that
is
met
in
this
case.
you
need
to
have
negotiations
outside
of
the
continental
area.
there
were
no
negotiations
in
the
case.
and
most
significantly,
and
i
want
to
stress
the
words
"most
significantly"
because
they
were
recognized
by
the
court,
the
court
said
the
performance
of
the
contract
is
to
be
carried
out
in
a
european
country.
in
this
case,
the
performance
of
the
contract,
which
is
most
significantly
stressed
by
the
court,
is
to
be
carried
out
in
american
soil,
puerto
rico.
so
i
say
that
scherk,
scherk,
as
such,
i
cannot
accept
as
applicable
to
this
set
of
facts,
just
like
that.
this
could
be
an
international
agreement,
but
a
truly
international
agreement
within
the
context
of
scherk,
i
would
respectfully
submit,
is
not
the
case
of
soler
with
mitsubishi.
finally,
i
believe
the
solicitor
general
will
address
in
more
detail
the
issue
of
the
nonapplicability
of
antitrust
claims.
the
case
of
southland,
which
has
not
been
mentioned,
i
believe
is
not
applicable.
in
southland
you
only
had
a
claim
under
the
franchise
act
of
california,
a
local
act.
in
this
case
you
have
a
claim
under
the
antitrust
act,
you
have
a
claim
under
the
automobile
dealer's
act
which
entitles
a
claimant,
an
automobile
dealer,
to
his
day
in
court,
day
in
court.
i
wonder
whether
all
these
rights
can
be
waived
through
a
stipulation
for
arbitration
someplace
in
the
world.
the
consequence
of
a
contrary
holding
by
this
honorable
court,
i
respectfully
