justice
white
is
there
any
issue
about
the
arbitrability
under
the
agreement,
i
mean,
that
reach?
justice
white
that
unless
there
is
some
policy
against
it,
the
arbitration
would
have
gone
forward
under
the
agreement.
justice
white
at
least
that
is
the
way
the
case
comes
to
us.
justice
white
i
don't
really
understand
that.
they
argue
the
contrary,
and
maybe
they
are
wrong.
you've
got
two
courts
with
you.
but
they
squarely
argue,
as
i
read
their
brief,
that
the...
it's
not
arbitrable
within
the
meaning
of
the
agreement.
justice
white
--there
are
two
cases
here,
aren't
there?
justice
white
and
that's
the--
justice
white
--well,
but
i
suppose
you
would
agree
that
the
respondent
in
the
case
you
are
arguing
could
support
affirmance
on
a
ground
that
is
within
the
reach
of
the
record.
i
mean,
he
doesn't
need
to
have
cross-petitioned
to...
he
may
argue
and
say
you
should
affirm
because
it
was
never
arbitrable
at
all.
the
respondent
may
certainly
do
that.
justice
white
well,
then,
that's
the
first
point
of
his
brief.
especially
since
he
presented
it
to
the
court
below.
justice
white
i
understand,
i
understand.
well,
he
argued
that
below,
and
he
is
arguing
it
here.
he
is
entitled
to
do
so.
justice
white
yes.
justice
white
yes.
justice
white
and
the
american
safety
is
not,
is
it?
justice
white
well,
we
might
just
disapprove
it
rather
than
overrule
it.
justice
white
but
american
safety
is
not
a
precedent
in
this
court.
justice
white
well,
what
if
an
arbitrator
says,
well,
i
just
don't
think
i
need
to
consider
claims
under
the
american
antitrust
laws;
we
will
just
ignore
them?
would
that...
could
that
arbitrator...
and
then
decided
against
the
antitrust
plaintiff,
would
that
be
subject
to
attack
in
this
country
in
the
sense
that
could
he
then
bring
a
suit
under
the
antitrust
laws
and
not
be
barred
by
that
arbitrator's
decision?
justice
white
or
the
issue...
or
the
issue
is
put
before
them
by
an
order
of
a
court
to
one
party
to
submit
it
to
arbitration.
justice
white
is
there
any
issue
before
us
as
to
the
choice
of
law?
is
there
a
choice
of
law
provision
in
this?
justice
white
so
an
arbitrator
could
say,
well,
i
didn't...
all
of
these
disputes
are
governed
by
swiss
law,
and
so
i
don't...
i
certainly
am
not
going
to
consider
american
arbitration...
antitrust
claims.
justice
white
why
wouldn't
he
be
bound
to?
justice
white
well--
justice
white
--what
if
mitsubishi
had
said
i
object
to
arbitrating
these
antitrust
claims?
there
just
aren't
any
claims
available--
justice
white
--no,
under...
they
are
just...
because
swiss
law
is
to
govern,
no
american
antitrust
claims
need
to
be
considered.
justice
white
yes.
justice
white
well,
why
shouldn't...
why
didn't
mitsubishi
or
why
didn't
your
client
in
response
to
the
antitrust
claim
say,
rely
on
the
choice
of
law
provision
and
say
that...
just
move
to
dismiss?
justice
white
well,
i
take
it
mitsubishi
anyway
decided
they
would
rather
arbitrate
it
than
risk
swiss
law.
justice
white
yes.
