justice
stevens
am
i
right,
mr.
kneedler,
that
what
would
happen
if
we
accepted
your
first
submission
is
that
we'd
dismiss
the
appeal,
he'd
refile
in
the
district
court
or
the
court
of
claims,
go
right
back
to
the
federal
circuit,
and
lose
there
again,
presumably,
because
they've
already
decided
this
question?
and
then
it
would
have
to
come
back
if
we're
ever
to
reach--
justice
stevens
--but
wouldn't
that
court
be
bound
by
the
opinion
that's
on
the
books
now
of
the
federal
circuit?
justice
stevens
but
as
a
practical
matter?
justice
stevens
mr.
kneedler,
can
i
ask
you
this
question.
i
understand
your
argument
to
be
that
there's
basically
a
difference
between
retirement
disability
on
the
one
hand
and
adverse
actions
on
the
other,
rather
than
a
difference
between
employees
on
the
one
hand
and
annuitants
or
retirees.
but
what
do
you
do
with
temporary
disability
cases
in
subsection
(c)
of
8337,
which
clearly
involve
employees,
and
then
which
clearly
come
within
the
language
of
7703,
"any
employee
or
applicant"?
it
seems
to
me
that
you've
got
to
bump
square
into
some
pretty
plain
statutory
language
to
maintain
your
position.
justice
stevens
well,
is
it
not
correct
that
there
is
in
8337(c)
a
provision
for
temporary
disability
for
employees,
who
retain
their
status
as
employees,
and
therefore
their
right
to
review
would
be
governed
by
7703?
justice
stevens
there's
no
temporary
disability
provision?
justice
stevens
but
you
would
say
that
even
temporary
disability
claims
are--
justice
stevens
--right.
justice
stevens
is
it
not
possible...
and
again,
i
don't
have
a
feel
for
the
whole
thing...
that
there
would
be
claims
where
both
types
of
claim
would
be
asserted
arising
out
of
the
same
employment,
a
personnel
action
that
somebody--
justice
stevens
--yes.
and
under
your
view
they
would
have
to
proceed
through
separate--
justice
stevens
--why
would
congress
want
the
two
different
procedures
for
two
rather
similar
types
of
cases?
justice
stevens
but
it
is
your
view
that
there
would
be
an
extra
layer
of
review
in
the
retirement
situation,
but
not
in
the
other?
you
go
to
the
district
court
and
then
up
to
the
federal--
justice
stevens
--just
the
sort
of
thing
you
criticized
in
the
florida
power
&
light
case.
justice
stevens
mr.
kneedler...
did
you
finish
your
answer?
justice
stevens
in
your
earlier
point
you
discussed
the
difference
between
actions
by
the
office
of
personnel
management
on
the
one
hand
and
actions
of
the
employing
agency
on
the
other
hand.
is
there
any
history
of
this
section
that
suggests
that
possibly
one
of
the
purposes
of
this
section
was
to
make
it
clear
that
these
decisions
were
to
be
made
by
opm
rather
than
by
the
employing
agency?
justice
stevens
the
language
that
they're
not
subject
to
review.
i
mean
particularly
that
it's
a
matter
of
deciding
who
gets
what
turf.
justice
stevens
right.
justice
stevens
that
would
have
been
understood
even
if
this
language
were
not
in?
justice
stevens
mr.
kneedler,
i
just
want
to
be
sure
you
address
one
thing
before
you
sit
down.
in
the
house
report
they
talk
about
expanded
judicial
review
as
a
new
concept
for
the
cases
covered
by
the
amendments,
suggesting
there
are
two
kinds
of
judicial
review,
one
broader
than
the
other.
what
do
you
do
with
that?
justice
stevens
well,
the
house
report
says
that
"it
is
reasonable
and
prober
to
restrict
expanded
judicial
review
to
one
category
of
cases.
"
it
rather
clearly
suggests
there
are
two
kinds.
you
say
that
is
just
wrong?
