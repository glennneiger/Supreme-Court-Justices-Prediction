mr.
john
murcko
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
case
here
concerns
the
issue
of
whether
or
not
the
federal
circuit
court
of
appeals
had
jurisdiction
to
rule
on
the
determinations
of
disability
retirement.
there
is
an
anomaly
in
this
case,
that
the
majority
of
judges
below
decided
that
the
federal
circuit
does
have
jurisdiction;
however,
the
ruling
was
that
in
this
particular
case
there
is
not
jurisdiction.
we
think
that
resolution
of
this
issue
is
very
straightforward.
simply,
this
court
is
called
upon
to
determine
whether
under
5
u.s.c.
8347(c)
the
federal
circuit
has
jurisdiction
to
rule
on
physical
disability
determinations
that
are
denied
by
the
opm
or
whether
it
is
precluded
only
from...
the
federal
circuit
is
only
precluded
from
reviewing
decisions
on
factual
determinations.
and
we
think
the
canons
of
judicial
interpretation
by
this
court
in
the
past
provide
a
very
straightforward
answer
here,
and
we
think
essentially
that
the
congressional
intent
here
was
only
to
limit
determinations
of
disability
retirement
on
factual
issues
and
not
on
legal,
procedural
or
constitutional
issues.
and
we
think
the
court
below
erred
when
it
ruled
the
way
it
did.
and
we
think
the
first
cannon
of
judicial
interpretation
is
that
there
is
no
clear
and
convincing
evidence
of
congressional
intent
to
bar
all
judicial
review
under
8347(c).
mr.
john
murcko
no--
mr.
john
murcko
--no,
i
don't
believe
that
we
do
have
to
reach
that
issue,
because
i
think
in
the
retirement
cases,
the
disability
retirement
cases,
jurisdiction
exists
under
8347(c),
and
that
that
is
the
basis
of
jurisdiction.
mr.
john
murcko
well,
we
think
that
under
7703
that,
first,
that
issue
is
not
related
here,
that
is
not
related
to
this
case.
however,
when
congress
passed
the
civil
service
reform
act
in
'77...
in
1978,
it
gave
a
broad
grant
of
jurisdiction
under
7703
and
it
specifically
stated
that
it
covered
all
cases
coming
from
the
merit
system
protection
board.
it
covered
all
cases
coming
from
the
merit
system
protection
board,
and
there
was
no
exclusion
of
any
cases
except
for
section
2
cases,
which
cover
discrimination.
so
we
think
that
there
is
a
broad
grant
of
review
there
under
7703,
as
we
cover
in
our
brief,
stating
that
we
believe
that--
mr.
john
murcko
--yes,
i
think
that
it
does.
mr.
john
murcko
no,
i
think
it
just
covers
employees
or
retired
employees.
in
fact,
the
federal
circuit
below
in
bronger
specifically
stated
that
it
includes
employees
and
the
retired
employees.
and
if
you
look
under
8337,
the
retirement
section,
it
says
that
an
employee
is
entitled
to
retirement
if
he
puts
in
five
years
and
he's
too
disabled
to
work.
and
if
you
don't...
if
you
adopt
the
interpretation
by
the
u.s.
government,
that
would
mean
that
an
individual
could
never
apply
for
retirement
if
he's
terminated
from
his
job.
and
there's
a
one-year
statute
of
limitations
after
a
person
is
terminated,
so
that
would
mean
a
person,
once
he
is
no
longer
working,
can
no
longer
apply
for
retirement.
and
second,
it
would
mean
that
any
person
who
is
terminated--
mr.
john
murcko
--i'm
sorry,
yes.
okay.
and
it
means
that
any
person
who...
any
employee
who
is
terminated
can
never
go
to
the
federal
circuit,
because
he's
no
longer
an
employee.
we
think,
returning
to
the
interpretation
of
8347(c),
we
think
that
the
plain
language
itself
indicates
that
there
is
a
bar
of
review
of
only
the
facts
and
not
of
legal,
procedural,
or
constitutional
questions.
the
wording
there
provides
that
the
opm
shall
determine
questions
of
disability
and
that
those
determinations
are
final.
the
language
there
does
not
state
that
it
should
be
a
final
determination
of
questions
of
procedure
and
law
and
constitutional
rights.
in
addition,
we
think
that
the
second
sentence
of
that
statute
specifically
states
that
the
opm
can
hold
hearings
to
determine
the
facts
of
medical
disability,
and
we
think
that's
further
language
supporting
our
position
that
it's
limited
only
to
review
of
facts.
in
addition,
the
pre-codification
of
1948,
the
first
finality
provision,
also
states
that
decisions
with
respect
to
questions
of
disability,
and
we
think
that
that
language
is
even
clearer
that
on
its
face
it
only
limits
factual
determinations.
but
further,
we
believe
that
congress
knows
how
to
preclude
the
courts
from
reviewing
statutes,
and
when
it
passed
211
of
the
veterans
act
and
also
8128
of
the
federal
employees
compensation
act,
it
said
that
no
courts
of
the
u.s.
shall
have
power
to
review
such
action.
now,
if
congress
meant
to
eliminate
all
review
it
could
definitely
have
put
that
language
in
there.
but
we
think
that,
even
more
important,
if
we
go
behind
the
legislative
words
here
of
8347
and
look
at
the
legislative
history,
we
think
that
it's
even
clearer.
first,
we
feel
that
the
basis
for
historical
review
under
u.s.
versus
erika
teaches
us
that
we
should
look
behind
a
statute
to
determine
what
the
congressional
intent
was,
and
we
think
that
at
a
minimum
it
can
be
argued
there
is
ambiguity
here
because
there
has
been
legal
interpretations
by
five
circuit
court
of
appeals
in
one
way
and
five
circuit
court
of
appeals
another
way.
so
we
think
that
the
legislative
history
first
shows
that
when
congress
first
passed
this
in
1948
it
was
in
the
period
when
it
also
passed
the
administrative
procedure
act,
and
the
administrative
procedure
act
specifically
stated
that
the
courts
shall
have
power
to
judicially
review
all
administrative
determinations.
and
this
limitation
was
passed
in
'48
and
it's
in
the
context
of
permitting
judicial
review,
and
so
it
left...
congress
intended
to
leave
the
expertise
or
the
factual
determination
to
the
agency.
in
addition,
there
was
the
court
interpretation
between
1956,
the
codification
language,
and
1980,
the
court
of
claims.
and
every
decision
decided
on
disability
retirement
stated
that
there
is
a
limited
right
of
review
under
the
scroggins
formula,
to
allow
review
for
procedural
errors,
for
constructions
of
legislation,
and
for
errors
going
to
the
heart
of
the
administrative
procedure.
so
we
think
that
congress,
when
it
amended
this
statute
in
1978,
specifically
adopted
those
judicial
interpretations
under
scroggins
to
make
that
clear
that
it
became
part
of
the
law,
and
the
scroggins
rules
were
adopted
into
the
language
of
1978.
in
addition,
the
1980
amendment
shows
that
there
were
no
changes,
no
changes
whatsoever
in
the
review
authority
for
non-mental
cases.
first,
congress
knew
at
the
time
when
it
was
passing
this
legislation
in
1980
that
there
was
all
this
judicial
review
allowing
them
to
review
for
procedural
errors.
next,
the
major
focus
of
congress,
as
shown
by
those
hearings,
was
that
there
was
an
overnarrowness
of
review
for
terminations,
involuntary
terminations
because
of
mental
disability.
in
addition,
no
one
ever
testified--
mr.
john
murcko
--well,
no.
those
were
ones
which
were
initiated
by
the
agency.
mr.
john
murcko
right,
the
agency.
involuntary
terminations,
your
honor.
and
no
one
ever
testified
at
these
hearings,
by
the
congressional
record,
either
at
the
committee,
the
senate
committee
on
government
affairs
or
the
house
committee
on
post
office
and
civil
affairs,
that
they
wanted
to
eliminate
judicial
review
of
procedural,
legal
and
constitutional
errors.
in
fact,
the
anomaly
here
is
that
the
office
of
personnel
management
director,
mr.
campbell,
and
his
assistant
testified
or
sent
letters
to
the
heads
of
these
departments
saying
that,
we
want
to
expand
review
for
involuntary
mental
terminations
and
we
want
to
keep
the
review
the
same.
well,
it's
quite
an
anomaly
that
now
the
government
is
saying
just
the
opposite:
we
didn't
mean
that,
but
instead
we
now
mean
that
we
want
to
cut
off
all
review
for
non-mental
involuntary
determinations.
mr.
john
murcko
congress
did
make
an
amendment
adding
that
section
to
it,
that
is
correct.
it
did
add
that
section
saying
that
now
for
involuntary
mental
terminations
there
is
full
review
under
7703,
which
includes
review
not
only
of
legal,
procedural
and
constitutional
errors,
but
there's
now
going
to
be
review
for
factual
errors,
too.
because
there
was
so
much
abuse
in
terminating
politically
active
employees,
and
there
was
a
large
history
of
that
action
by
agencies
in
terminating
people.
in
addition,
in
the
committee
reports
or
discussions
there
is
no
evidence
that
the
scroggins
test
was
to
be
eliminated
in
the
non-mental
area.
there
was
no
actual
substantive
change
in
the
language
of
the
finality
clause
itself.
so
we
think
that
the
intent
here
of
congress
was
to
expand
the
limited
review
and
give
the
full
scope
of
review
to
involuntary
mental
disability
determinations
and
to
maintain
it
in
the
other
area,
and
we
think
that
there
is
no
clear
and
convincing
evidence
to
allow
the
conclusion
that
there
should
be
no
review
for
the
federal
employees'
rights.
in
addition,
we
think
that
the
second
error
that
the
court
committed
below
was
that
it
failed
to
give
deference
to
the
administrative
construction
of
8347.
the
merit
system
protection
board,
which
decides
these
cases
on
an
administrative
level,
has
taken
the
position
in
its
rulings
that
judicial
review
is
available
by
the
federal
circuit.
in
addition,
it
took
that
position
in
the
federal
circuit
below
as
an
amicus;
and
it
notifies
employees
who
are
adversely...
who
get
adverse
decisions
that
they
have
a
right
to
appeal
to
the
federal
circuit.
in
addition,
the
opm
has
consistently
taken
that
position,
as
i
mentioned
before,
in
decisions
before
the
congress
at
the
time
this
legislation
was
passed
in
1980.
so
we
think
that
the
court
below
failed
to
give
deference
to
that
administrative
rulings,
administrative
determination,
when
it
ruled
that
it
has
no
jurisdiction.
in
addition,
we
think
that
the
federal
circuit
below
committed
a
third
error
when
it
stated
that...
in
its
construction
of
8347,
it
raised
substantial
constitutional
questions.
and
we
think
that
the
canon
of
construction
here
is
that
if
there
is
an
interpretation
of
a
statute
which
will
avoid
the
constitutional
issue,
then
the
court
should
adopt
that
construction.
and
we
think
that
by
adopting
the
construction
that
we
say
8347...
the
construction
that
was
given
by
the
court
in
parodi
versus
opm
by
the
ninth
circuit,
that
essentially
is
an
expansion
of
judicial
review
to
the
non-mental
area
and
retention,
does
not
raise
that
constitutional
error
of
preclusion
of
judicial
review.
mr.
john
murcko
yes,
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
john
murcko
yes,
it
existed
verbatim
except
it
said...
the
amendment
said
except
to
the
extent
as
provided
in
section
(d).
that
was
added
by
the
1980
amendment.
mr.
john
murcko
that's
correct,
your
honor,
that's
correct.
and
so
we
think
that,
in
addition,
moving
on,
that
there
is
also
a
question
of
possible
property
rights
here
of
mr.
lindahl
as
it
affects
his
disability
retirement.
and
so
the
court
below
could
have
avoided
those
constitutional
issues
if
it
essentially
interpreted
8347,
as
it
had
in
the
past,
that
it
precluded
only
review
of
the
factual
determinations.
so
in
conclusion,
we
think
essentially
that
we
are
dealing
here
with
an
issue
of
preclusion
of
judicial
review.
we
believe
that
this
preclusion
is
favored
by
the
courts.
we
think
that
it
would
also
be
unusual
for
federal
employees
not
to
have
the
right
to
have
review
in
the
federal
courts,
and
we
believe
that,
most
important,
the
congressional
intent
here
was
to
allow
review
for
procedural,
constitutional
and
legal
errors.
thank
you.
mr.
john
murcko
yes,
i
have
a
few
points
if
i
have
some
further
time.
first,
we
think
we'd
like
to
discuss
the
point
that
was
raised
about
jurisdiction
under
the
tucker
act
and
the
requirement
that
we
go
to
the
court
of
claims.
we
think
that
is
completely
contrary
to
the
congressional
intent
here.
congress,
when
it
passed
the
federal
uniform
act
in
1982...
federal
court
improvement
act,
excuse
me...
specifically
had
an
intention
here
that
there
was
to
be
uniformity
of
the
decisions
and
that
there
was
to
be
one
court,
the
federal
circuit,
which
was
to
decide
all
cases
of
federal
employment,
concerning
adverse
actions
and
retirements.
but
if
we
take
the
position
in
the
u.s.
government
that
there
should
be
a
two-tiered
review,
we're
going
back
in
time.
we're
going
back
to
what
the
congress
intended
to
eliminate
by
the
federal
court
improvement
act,
all
these
diverse
decisions
in
the
district
courts,
in
the
court
of
claims.
that
isn't
what
congress
intended.
in
addition,
congress
intended
to
eliminate
the
two-tier
review
system
which
existed
before,
from
1978
to
1982,
where
you
go
first
to
the
civil
service
commission,
then
you
go
upstairs
to
the
district
court,
and
then
you
go
to
the
court
of
appeals.
well,
that
congress
felt
was
a
waste
of
money.
that
was
a
waste
of
money,
a
waste
of
judicial
time
and
resources.
so
we
think
that
by
sending
this
case
back
to
the
court
of
claims
it
would
be
completely
contrary
to
the
intent
of
congress.
but
even
further,
we
think
that
it
would
also
be
an
act
which
would
be
incorrect
because
essentially
we
would
wind
up
in
the
same
position
we
are
here
today,
that
it
would
go
to
the
court
of
claims,
who
would
say
that
they're
bound
under
1295,
subsection
(9),
by
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals.
so
it
would
be
a
fruitless
act.
second,
this
whole
question
about
employees
we
think
is
an
issue
that
is
not
before
this
court.
that
was
the
issue
that
was
raised
in
the
bronger
case,
and
the
solicitor
general's
office
is
attempting
to
back-door
it
into
this
court
through
this
case.
if
they
want
a
decision
on
bronger,
they
should
file
a
petition
for
a
writ
of
certiorari
on
that
particular
case.
but
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
federal
circuit
has
decided
that
case,
and
in
that
decision
they
said
that
the
arguments
raised
by
the
opm
there
are
frivolous,
frivolous
at
their
best.
so
we
think
that
the
court
should
not
address
that
issue,
because
that
has
not
been
briefed
by
bronger's
attorney
and
he
should
be
allowed
to
have
an
opportunity
to
come
to
court
and
argue
his
position.
in
addition,
the
position
of
the
government
that
there
are
two
separate
procedures
here,
one
for
adverse
actions,
one
for
disability
retirement,
is
contrary
to
the
history
of
the
civil
service
reform
act,
contrary
to
prior
procedures.
when
congress
passed
7701,
it
embodied
all
of
the
civil
service
regulations
on
retirement
and
also
on
adverse
actions,
and
it
codified
those
regulations
in
7701
and
provided
for
full
review
by
the
merit
system
protection
board
of
adverse
actions
and
retirement
claims.
there's
no
basis
for
any
distinction
in
an
administrative
hearing,
and
congress
intended
to
have
administrative
review
by
the
merit
system
protection
board
of
retirement
claims,
like
adverse
actions
by
the
merit
system
protection
board,
and
also
by
the
federal
circuit.
that
was
the
specific
congressional
intent
when
it
passed
the
civil
service
reform
act.
in
addition,
part
of
the
civil
service...
when
congress
was
considering
the
civil
service
reform
act,
they
also
read
the
reorganization
act,
section
202,
which
was
the
executive's
position.
and
the
executive
branch
stated
that
retirement
cases
fall
under
this
provision,
they're
entitled
to
a
hearing,
and
they
should
have
the
same
right
to
review
as
adverse
actions.
and
the
congress
considered
that.
further,
the
merit
system
protection
board
has
essentially
taken
the
same
position
that
we
have
in
this
particular
case,
that
there
is
review.
we
think
that
the
intention
of
congress
here
was
to
expand
judicial
review
in
the
area
of
mental
cases,
mental
involuntary
retirement
determinations,
and
to
maintain.
and
we
think
the
congress
originally,
when
it
was
considering
this
legislation,
wanted
to
have
de
novo
review
of
the
entire
area,
complete
de
novo
review
for
mental
and
physical
retirement
cases.
however,
the
opm
came
in
and
argued
against
that,
saying
they
just
wanted
expanded
review
for
the
mental
cases.
in
addition,
we
think
that,
relying
on
the
opm
decision,
it
modified
this
legislation
to
just
provide
expanded
review
for
the
area
of
involuntary
mental
retirement
cases.
in
addition,
if
the
congressional
hearings
are
read
very
closely,
we
see
that
representative
spellman
and
senator
pryor
both
state
that
this
limitation
on
judicial
review,
this
limitation
on
judicial
review
must
be
eliminated
so
that
these
improper
practices
are
done
away
with.
in
addition,
we
think
that
the
construction
of
this
court
that
when
congress
passes
an
amendment
it
intends
to
adopt
the
judicial
interpretation
of
that
statute
is
required
by
the
illinois
brick
case
and
the
canning
versus
university
of
chicago
case.
and
we
think
that
congress,
when
it
passed
both
the
'78
and
'80
amendments,
attempted
to...
or
was
assumed
to
adopt
the
scroggins
decision,
decisions
or
line
of
cases.
so
we
feel
that
the
court
here
should
rule
that
the
federal
circuit
below
had
jurisdiction
to
determine
the
issue,
that
the
intent
of
congress
was
to
allow
limited
jurisdiction
review
in
this
area,
and
we
think
that
all
of
the
questions
of
procedural
or
substantive
errors
should
be
sent
back
to
that
court
for
their
ultimate
determination.
thank
you.
