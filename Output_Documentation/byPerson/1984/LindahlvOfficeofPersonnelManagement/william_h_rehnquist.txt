those
were
terminations,
mr.
murcko,
that
had
been
initiated
by
the
person
himself,
the
ones
for
mental
disability?
justice
rehnquist
by
the
agency.
justice
rehnquist
well,
congress
did
at
least
change
the
language.
justice
rehnquist
mr.
murcko,
it's
section
8347(c)
that
the
government
relies
on
to
say
that
the
decision
in
your
client's
case
case
wasn't
reviewable
by
the
federal
circuit?
justice
rehnquist
now,
was
the
language
in
8347(c),
was
that
existent,
did
that
exist
verbatim
before
the
1980
amendments?
justice
rehnquist
and
the
rest
of
the
language
remained
the
same?
justice
rehnquist
if
you're
right
on
the
first
point,
the
federal
circuit
world
have
had
no
jurisdiction
to
review
this
claim.
but
had
the
claim
been
brought
in
the
claims
court
or
in
the
district
court,
the
federal
circuit
then
would
have
had...
would
have
been
authorized
to
review.
and
to
what
extent
would
8307
have
precluded
a
review?
justice
rehnquist
so
8347
applies
across
the
board
regardless
of
which
court
you're
in?
justice
rehnquist
well,
how
could
we
remand
a
case
which
we
had
no
jurisdiction
to
hear?
justice
rehnquist
we
would
dismiss
the
appeal
and
then
remand
the
case?
justice
rehnquist
these
are
the
actions
that
are
initiated
originally
by
the
agency?
