mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
dismissing
petitioner's
appeal
from
the
decision
of
the
merit
system
protection
board
was
correct
on
either
of
two
alternative
grounds.
the
court
of
appeals
decided
only
one
of
these
grounds
it
held
that
judicial
review
is
barred
by
8347(c)
in
this
case
because
petitioner
seeks
review
of
the
administrative
determination
that
he
was
not
disabled.
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
reach
the
government's
threshold
submission
below,
however,
that
an
individual
does
not
have
a
right
of
direct
appeal
to
the
federal
circuit
under
the
civil
service
retirement
program
pursuant
to
section
1295(a)(9)
of
title
28.
section
1295(a)(9)
insofar
as
it's
relevant
here
simply
refers
back
to
section
7703(b)(1),
which
provides
for
the
filing
of
petitions
for
review
in
the
federal
circuits
by
individuals.
i
would...
because
it
is
a
threshold
question,
though,
i
would
like
to
address
it
at
the
outset.
before
doing
so,
i'd
like
to
respond
briefly
to
the
suggestion
by
petitioner
and
several
of
the
amici
in
this
case
that
this
issue
is
not
before
the
court
or
that
it
was
somehow
inappropriate
for
us
to
raise
it.
first
of
all,
it
is
an
alternative
ground
for
affirmance
of
the
judgment
below
and
it's
a
ground
that
was
raised
below,
and
for
that
reason
alone
we
as
respondent
are
entitled
to
raise
it.
but
beyond
that,
if
the
federal
circuit
did
not
have
jurisdiction
under
1295(a)(9)
the
case
was
not
properly
in
the
court
of
appeals
and
therefore
this
court
does
not
have
certiorari
jurisdiction
to
reach
other
issues
in
the
case.
so
far
from
it
being
inappropriate
to
raise
it,
we
felt
obligated
to
do
so.
the
question
whether
the
federal
circuit
has
direct
appellate
jurisdiction
in
appeals
by
an
individual
affects
not
just
the
disability
retirement
cases,
but
all
retirement
cases.
the
direct
appeal
mechanism
was
added
in
the
civil
service
reform
act
in
1978
and
its
language,
its
structure,
and
its
legislative
history
indicate
that
it
was
intended
to
address
adverse
actions
and
other
personnel
type
matters
that
were
addressed
by
the
civil
service
reform
act.
it
was
not
intended
to
apply
to
the
civil
service
retirement
program,
which
is
governed
by
separate
statutory
procedures
and
was
not
substantively
amended
by
the
civil
service
reform
act.
now,
i
should
also
stress
at
the
outset
that
we're
not
arguing
that
all
judicial
review
of
retirement
claims
are
barred.
this
court
in
1936
in
the
dismuke
decision
said
that
a
person
whose
application
for
civil
service
retirement
is
denied
can
bring
a
suit
under
the
tucker
act
for
a
money
judgment.
that
established
avenue
of
judicial
review
is
not
disturbed
by
the
civil
service
reform
act,
nor
by
the
federal
courts
improvement
act
of
1982,
and
it
remains
available
to
persons
seeking
retirement
benefits
except
where
review
is
precluded,
as
in
cases
involving
disability.
but
a
suit
under
the
tucker
act
has
to
be
brought
in
the
first
instance
in
the
claims
court
or
in
the
district
court
for
the
subsequent
appeal
to
the
federal
circuit,
not
in
the
federal
circuit
in
the
first
instance.
but
our
submission
does
not
cut
off
review
in
such
cases
by
the
federal
circuit,
since
all
appeals
in
tucker
act
suits
go
to
that
court.
that
therefore
is
faithful
to
the
central
purpose
of
both
acts
in
centralizing
review
in
the
federal
circuit.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
8347(c)
would
preclude
review
on
the
question
of
disability
in
any
court,
by
the
federal
circuit
or
by
the
district
or
claims
court
under
the
tucker
act.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
yes.
i'm
sorry,
i
guess
i
didn't
make
that
clear.
that's
correct.
we're
just
talking
about
the,
i
guess
what
you
could
call
subject
matter
jurisdiction,
whether
the
federal
circuit
could
entertain
the
case
in
the
first
instance.
if
it
has
jurisdiction,
then
the
question
of
whether
review
on
this
disability
question
is
precluded
then
is
a
second
question
that
the
court
could
decide.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
that...
i
don't
think
it
would
be
necessary
to
dismiss
the
appeal
in
this
case.
we
suggested
in
our
brief
that
an
appropriate
disposition
would
be
for
this
court
to
remand
to
the
federal
circuit
with
directions
to
transfer
the
case
to
the
claims
court,
since
under
section
1631
of
title
28
a
court
can--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
i
think
as
a
legal
matter
perhaps
technically
not,
because
i
presume
the
judgment--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--would
be
vacated
in
this
case.
as
a
practical
matter,
i
suspect
a
claims
court
judge
might
well
perceive
himself
to
be
bound
as
a
practical
matter.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
i
think
it
might
be
in
aid
of
the
court's...
the
court
certainly
has
jurisdiction
to
decide
the
jurisdictional
question,
and
in
that
event
i
think
it
could
reasonably
be
in
aid
of
the
court's
decision
on
that
jurisdictional
question.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
dismiss
the
petition.
i
think
the
court
could
do
that,
and
perhaps
1631
itself
would
apply
to
this
court
in
terms
of
the
transfer.
i
think
a
liberal
construction
of
that
statute
might
embrace
this
situation.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
i
don't
think
it
would
be
necessary
to
enter
a
judgment.
our
submission
that
the
federal
circuit
did
not
have
jurisdiction
in
this
case
starts
with
the
separation
of
the
retirement
and
the
personnel
sections
of
the
civil
service
laws
prior
to
the
civil
service
reform
act
of
1978.
with
respect
to
adverse
actions
and
similar
personnel
matters,
those
were
things
that
were
initiated
by
the
employing
agency
against
the
employee,
although
there
was
a
subsequent
right
of
appeal
to
the
civil
service
commission
in
certain
cases
governed
by
section
7701
of
title
5,
and
there
was
a
right
to
an
administrative
hearing
on
such
an
adverse
action.
the
retirement
program,
on
the
other
hand,
was
governed
by
separate
provisions
in
subchapter
83.
the
retirement
program
was
centrally
administered
by
the
civil
service
commission,
not
by
the
employing
agencies,
and
the
process
was
ordinarily
initiated
by
the
employee
filing
an
application,
not
the
agency
taking
action
against
the
employee.
and
although
there
was
a
right
of
administrative
appeal
within
the
civil
service
commission
on
denial
of
a
retirement
claim,
that
was
not
subject
to
section
7701,
which
required
a
hearing,
but
was
instead
subject
to
whatever
procedures
were
prescribed
by
the
civil
service
commission
itself.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
i'm
not
sure
i
understand
the
question.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
i
don't
think
so.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
no,
as
i
read
section
8337(c)
it
refers
to
an
annuitant
receiving
disability
retirement.
as
i
understand
the
way
the
retirement
program
operates,
when
someone
is
found
eligible
for
a
retirement
annuity
he
is
separated
from
the
federal
service.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
yes.
the
question
you're
referring
to,
i
suppose
the
language
"unless
his
disability
is
permanent
in
character?
"
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
that
i
think
just
refers
back
to
the
periodic
review
of
someone
who
is...
it
refers
to
an
annuitant
under
8337(c),
not
an
employee.
so
it's
referring
to
a
situation
where
someone
has
been
found
to
be
disabled,
therefore
would
have
been
separated
from
his
employment.
but
in
order
to
make
sure
that
someone
who
recovers
doesn't
continue
to
get
benefits,
this
provision
simply
requires
that
he
be
reviewed
periodically
unless
a
decision
was
made
at
the
outset
that
his
disability
is
permanent,
in
which
case
it
would
be
futile
or
unnecessary
to
re-examine
him
periodically.
a
similar
sort
of
judgment
was
made
in
the
social
security
disability
reform
act,
where
persons
receiving
social
security
disability
benefits
are
not
reviewed
periodically
if
it
was
a
permanent
disability.
you
are
correct,
justice
stevens,
though,
that
our
submission
is
not
based
on
a
distinction
between
employees
on
the
one
hand
and
survivors
on
the
other.
the
fact
that
congress
used
the
word
7701
and
section
7703
in
our
view
indicates
that
it
didn't
have
the
retirement
program
in
mind
in
furnishing
a
right
of
direct
review.
this
is
so
because
there
are
numerous
people
covered
by
the
retirement
program
who
are
not
employees
and
often
never
were.
by
far
the
largest
category
are
those...
are
survivors.
and
i'm
informed
by
the
office
of
personnel
management
that
there
are
almost
half
a
million
persons
receiving
civil
service
retirement
benefits
as
survivors.
so
this
is
not
some
incidental
group
of
persons
who
would
be
outside
the
scope
of
the
direct
review
mechanism.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
an
adverse
action
and
a--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--yes,
and
in
fact
opm
recently
revised
its
procedures
to
try
to
separate
the
two
to
the
degree
possible.
the
controversy
about
agency-filed
mental
disability
cases,
for
example,
arose
when
the
agency
would
file
a
retirement
application
when
in
fact
what
it
was
trying
to
do
was
remove
someone,
or
this
was
the
theory.
well,
opm
revised
its
regulations
now
to
require
the
removal
action
to
go
forward
first
and
for
the
agency
to
decide
to
remove
someone
and
actually
issue
an
order
of
removal,
and
only
then,
after
that's
completed,
will
opm
consider
the
retirement
application.
and
opm...
then
there
are
separate
avenues
for
review
of
those
two
decisions,
the
standard
approach
or
avenue
of
review
for
adverse
actions
on
the
one
hand
through
7703
and
the
retirement
claim
on
the
other.
and
there's
no
anomaly
in
that
because,
even
to
the
extent
a
removal
could
be
based
on
a
person's
physical
characteristics,
perhaps
an
inability
to
do
the
job,
it's
well
settled
that
a
finding
of
disability
under
the
retirement
program
is
not
controlled
by
whether
someone
was
terminated
from
his
employment
because
of
an
inability
to
do
the
job.
we
cite
in
our
brief,
although
not
for
this
proposition,
the
polas
case
and
the
piccone
case
and
the
fancher
case
of
the
court
of
claims,
all
of
which
stand
for
that
proposition.
so
the
fact
that
there
are
separate
avenues
of
review
simply
means
there
are
separate
questions,
even
in
a
case
involving
disability,
that
would
be
decided
in
the
two
circumstances.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
in
one
respect
they
aren't
that
similar.
the
petitions
for
review
and
adverse
actions
in
personnel
matters
really
concern
things
arising
out
of
the
ongoing
employment
relationship:
reductions
in
force,
in-grade
increases,
adverse
actions,
suspensions,
the
whole
panoply
of
issues
involving
the
senior
executive
service.
and
the
retirement
program
is
something
of
an
insurance
program,
which
is
somewhat
different
and
apart
from
that.
and
as
i
mentioned,
it
concerns
many
applications
or
issues
by
people
who
are
not
in
federal
employment
and
often
never
were.
and
it
was
historically
administered
by
a
bureau
of
retirement
and
civil
service
commission,
separate
from
the
involvement
with
adverse
actions.
and
as
i
also
mentioned,
the
retirement
program
has
always
beer
directly
administered
by
the
civil
service
commission.
the
personnel
matters
are
primarily
the
responsibility
of
the
respective
agencies,
the
employing
agencies.
so
there
are
a
lot
of
reasons
why,
to
explain
why
congress
would
have--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--yes,
that
is
true.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
the
judgment
is
not...
i'm
not
here
suggesting
what
would
be
the
best
policy
judgment.
our
submission
is
that
that
was
the
arrangement
prior
to
the
civil
service
reform
act,
and
that
congress
simply
didn't
change
it.
it
may
be
fair
to
say
that
congress
didn't
specifically
focus
on
it,
but
no
one
has
pointed
to
anything
in
the
legislative
history
in
which
congress
said
it
intended
civil
service
retirement
cases
to
be
now
channeled
through
this
individual
right
of
review
in
the
federal
circuit.
so
our
submission
is
that
congress
simply
didn't
disturb
the
prior
arrangement.
and
the
employee
language
is
important
in
cur
view,
because
it
doesn't
seer
to
make...
the
federal
circuit
has
held
that
a
survivor
does
have
to
bring
a
suit
under
the
tucker
act,
rather
than
directly
in
the
federal
circuit.
but
that
seems
also
to
us
to
make
no
sense,
because
two
different
types
of
cases
would
go
to
two
different
courts
under
the
same
program.
we
think
that
the
indication,
rather,
by
the
focusing
on
the
word
"employee"
is
that
congress
wasn't
considering
retirement
at
all.
secondly,
7703
refers
to
applicants
for
employment.
well,
it
refers
to
one
kind
of
applicant,
but
not
to
the
type
of
applicant
that's
involved
in
this
case,
an
applicant
for
retirement
benefits.
so
the
fact
that
congress
focused
on
one
type
of
applicant,
but
not
this
one,
again
supports
the
inference.
7701
and
7703
both
refer
to
the
agency
involved.
well,
the
agency
would
typically
be
the
employing
agency,
and
it
doesn't
seem
to
fit
the
civil
service
commission
and
then
opm,
which
administer
the
retirement
program.
and
then
finally,
section
7701,
which
is
part
of
this
comprehensive
standard
of
review
involving
7701
and
7703,
states
that
the
agency's
decision
on
a
matter
will
be
sustained
if
it's
supported
by
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence.
well,
that
may
make
sense
when
it's
the
agency
that
has
taken
the
action
against
the
employee,
but
it
doesn't
make
any
sense
at
all
in
the
retirement
program,
where
the
employee
is
submitting
an
application
for
a
benefit.
it
would
make
no
sense
to
put
the
burden
on
opm
to
disapprove
the
person's
entitlement
to
benefits,
and
in
fact
prior
to
the
civil
service
reform
act
it
was
uniformly
held
by
the
courts
and
by
the
civil
service
commission
that
the
applicant
had
the
burden
of
proof.
there's
no
suggestion
that
congress
changed
that,
and
in
fact
the
courts
since
the
civil
service
reform
act
of
'78
have
unanimously
held,
as
has
the
merit
system
protection
board,
that
the
applicant
bears
the
burden
of
proof.
but
7701,
which
is
part
of
this
review
mechanism
for
an
employee
to
go
to
the
court
of
appeals,
puts
the
burden
of
proof
the
other
way.
that's
another
indication
that
the
special
statutory
scheme
congress
was
focusing
on
then
did
not
apply
to
retirement
cases.
there
is
one
other
indication
of
that,
actually
two
others:
one
in
the
'78
act,
where
congress
wanted...
provided
for
a
direct
appeal
in
the
act
itself
to
the
merits
system
protection
board.
it
ordinarily
provided
for
that
to
be
taken
pursuant
to
section
7701,
again
within
the
special
statutory
review
procedure.
but
under
the
retirement
program,
congress...
the
only
amendments
congress
made
to
the
retirement
program
were
to
divide
the
former
responsibilities
of
the
civil
service
commission
into
two.
it
gave
opm
the
administrative
part
of
it
and
the
merit
system
protection
board
the
authority
to
hear
appeals.
so
it
amended
the
appellate
provision,
8347(d),
to
give
a
right
of
administrative
appeals
to
the
merit
systems
protection
board,
but,
significantly,
it
did
not
say
that
such
an
appeal
would
be
pursuant
to
7701,
unlike
every
other
case
in
the
act
where
it
had
done
so.
so
again,
this
suggests
that
congress
focused
on
the
question
of
appeals
in
retirement
cases
and
decided
not
to
make
them
subject
to
the
statutory
review
procedure.
and
finally,
in
1980
congress
enacted
the
amendments
that
have
been
discussed
before,
which
provide
for...
explicitly
provide
for
a
right
of
administrative
appeal
to
the
mspb
under
7701
and
judicial
review
under
7703
in
cases
involving
agency-filed
applications.
this
express
grant
of
authority
under
7703
would
have
been
unnecessary
of
those
appeals
were
already
taken
pursuant
to
7703,
as
petitioner
submits.
moreover,
there
was
every
reason
why
congress
would
have
treated
those
sorts
of
appeals
differently.
what
has
to
be
remembered
there
is
that
the
application
in
that
category
of
cases
was
filed
by
the
agency,
not
the
employee,
and
it's
a
situation
where
the
mspb
or
opm
would
have
actually
found
that
the
person
is
disabled.
and
when
the
person
seeks
review
of
that
by
the
mspb
or
in
court,
he
is
not
seeking
an
annuity,
he's
not
seeking
a
retirement
annuity
under
the
retirement
program.
what
he
is
really
doing
is
challenging
the
finding
that
he
was
disabled
and
had
to
be
separated
from
his
job.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
by
the
agency,
that's
correct.
so
it's
something
that
congress
viewed
as
more
in
the
nature
of
an
adverse
action.
in
fact,
the
legislative
history
shows
that,
that
it
had
a
stigmatizing
effect
on
employees
and
therefore
congress
decided
to
assimilate
it
into
the
adverse
action
procedures
by
providing
a
special
7701
statutory
right
to
a
hearing
and
the
right
to
judicial
review
under
7703.
it
seems
to
us
that
the
obvious
inference
from
that
is
that
congress
did
not
intend
for...
or
believed
and
continued
to
believe
that
retirement
cases
brought
by
an
individual
seeking
review
were
not
brought
under
7703.
and
we
cite
in
the
legislative
history
of
the
civil
service
reform
act
that
congress
recognized
that
7701
and
7703
did
not
grant
an
individual
a
statutory
right
of
review
under
those
procedures,
and
that
it
was
enacting
new
procedures.
so
given
all
of
that,
it
seems
to
us
the
various
indicia
add
up
to,
we
think,
an
inescapable
conclusion
that
congress
did
not
bring
retirement
appeals
by
individuals
under
the
7703
procedure.
if
the
court
should
disagree
with
our
submission
on
that
point,
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
dismissing
petitioner's
direct
appeal
nevertheless
was
correct
because
judicial
review
in
this
case
is
barred
by
8347(c)
of
title
5.
now,
i
should
also
point
out
in
saying
this
that
this
does
not
leave
an
employee
in
a
disability
case
without
any
substantial
protection
against
an
arbitrary
or
erroneous
denial
of
an
application
for
disability
benefits.
opm's
decision,
if
it
stands
by
that
on
reconsideration,
is
subject
to
review
by
the
merit
systems
protection
board,
which
is
the
very
agency
congress
established
in
1978
as
independent
and
quasi-judicial
to
review
and
protect
the
rights
of
employees.
so
that
the
denial
of
disability
benefits
is
protected
by
that,
and
there
is
a
right
to
a
hearing
by
the
mspb
in
connection
with
that.
so
the
question
that
we're
concerned
with
here
is
whether
there
is
another
layer
of
review,
whether
the
statute
requires
another
layer
of
review
by
an
article
3
court.
and
we
think
the
answer
to
that
question
is
that
it
does
not.
i'd
like
to
begin
with
the
language
of
8347(c),
which
is
of
course
where
we
must
begin.
that
section
provides
that
opm
"shall
determine
questions
of
disability
arising
under
the
retirement
subchapter
of
the
civil
service
laws,
except
to
the
extent.
"
--and,
"except
to
the
extent
provided
under
subsection
(d),
the
decisions
of
opm
concerning
these
matters
are
final
and
conclusive
and
are
not
subject
to
review.
"
8347(d)
then
in
turn
provides
for
an
administrative
review
by
the
mspb,
and
this
limited
judicial
review
for
agency-filed
mental
disability
cases
which
doesn't
apply
here.
the
net
effect
is
that...
and
petitioner
doesn't
dispute
this...
that
8347(c)
applies
to
judicial
review
and
bars
judicial
review.
the
only
disagreement
between
us
is
what
the
scope
of
that
bar
is.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
that's
correct.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
yes.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
which--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--no,
i
think
not,
because
historically
the
retirement
program
was
always
centrally
administered,
not
handled
by
the
employing
agencies.
so
the
application
would
have
been
submitted
to
the
civil
service
commission,
and
before
that
i
think
it
was
the
veterans
administration.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
so
i
don't
think
it
carries
that
connotation.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
yes,
yes.
in
the
court
of
appeals
petitioner
argued
that
the
decision
of
the
mspb
denying
his
application
for
disability
benefits
was
not
supported
by
substantial
evidence.
in
this
court,
however,
he
seems
to
concede
that,
whatever
else
8347(c)
may
mean,
it
does
not
permit
a
court
to
review
an
mspb
decision
on
the
basis
of
substantial
evidence.
and
in
fact,
the
courts
are
unanimous
on
the
question
that
8347(c)
bars
any
inquiry
into
the
factual
or
evidentiary
issues
underlying
a
decision
with
respect
to
disability.
petitioner
also
argues,
however,
that
8347(c)
does
not
bar
review
on
questions
of
law
or
procedure
that
may
underlie
a
decision
of
no
disability.
in
this
particular
case,
he
argues
that
the
particular
error
was
that
in
his
view
mspb
erred
in
placing
the
burden
of
proof
on
him,
rather
than
on
the
agency,
on
opm,
on
the
question
of
disability.
now,
as
we've
pointed
out,
as
i
pointed
out
before
and
as
we
point
out
in
our
brief,
that
position
is
wholly
insubstantial.
it
was
never
the
law
before
the
civil
service
reform
act
and
it
is
not
the
law
now.
putting
the
merits
to
one
side,
petitioner's
submission
that
8347(c)
is
limited
to
factual
questions,
not
questions
of
law
or
procedure,
is
in
our
view
inconsistent
with
the
plain
language
and
purpose
of
8347(c),
with
the
parallel
preclusions
of
review
under
the
other
statutes
that
grant
benefits
to
federal
officials
who
are
disabled,
that
being
the
federal
employment
compensation
act
and
the
veterans
statutes,
and
also
inconsistent
with
the
1980
amendments.
the
pertinent
language
under
8347(c)
refers
to
opm.
well,
the
term
"decision"
connotes
a
judgment
or
a
decision
resolving
all
procedural,
factual
and
legal
questions,
not
just
factual
questions.
and
ordinarily
where
congress
intends
to
include
only
factual
questions,
it
uses
the
term
"findings
of
fact",
not
"decisions".
that's
true
in
28
u.s.c.
1291,
governing
appeals
to
the
courts
of
appeals.
it's
true
with
respect
to
section
405(g)
of
the
social
security
act.
and
particularly
it's
true
under
the
very
provisions
that
petitioner
invokes
in
this
case,
7703(b)(1)
and
1295(a)(9).
both
provide
for
review
of
final
orders
and
decisions
of
the
merit
system
protection
board,
which
obviously
in
that
context
includes
questions
of
law
and
procedure
as
well
as
fact.
and
in
fact,
7703(c)
says
so.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
in
fact
what
the
committee
report
is
referring
to
is
back
to
the
director
of
opm's
letter,
that
the
director
would
not
oppose
that.
what
the
director
in
his
letter
referred
to
is
what's
called
the
scroggins
formula,
and
he
was
simply
reciting
what
the
court
of
claims
in
fact
had
held.
he
wasn't,
i
think,
endorsing
that
as
a
matter
of
statutory
construction.
in
fact,
we
point
out
in
our
brief
that
at
the
same
time
the
government
was
arguing
that
8347(c)
is
a
complete
bar.
but
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
congress
itself
nowhere
in
the
legislative
history
endorsed
the
scroggins
formula.
the
administration...
the
opm
representative
told
congress
about
the
scroggins
formula,
but
congress
had
no
occasion
to
focus
on
it,
because
all
of
the
cases,
scroggins
and
the
other
cases
that
the
court
was
referring
to
in
terms
of
expanded
review,
all
arose
in
this
agency-filed
mental
disability
case.
congress
expanded
the
pre-existing
right
of
review
as
to
that
category
of
cases.
but
the
issue
here
is
not
that
category
of
cases,
but
whether
the
federal
circuit
was
wrong
in
not
using
the
scroggins
formula
in
other
cases
where
congress
had
chosen
not
to
provide
a
special
statutory
right
of
judicial
review.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
i
understood
that
to
be
referring
back
to
the
director.
that
is
what
the
director
said.
he
said
that
the
voluntary
right,
voluntary...
what
we
call
voluntary
appeals,
filed
by
the
employee,
rather
than
the
agency-filed
ones,
should
not
be
subject
to
this
new
procedure.
but
whatever...
whatever
the
director
said
or
whatever
congress
might
have
thought,
the
fact
of
the
matter
is,
as
justice
rehnquist's
question
pointed
out,
congress
did
not
amend
that
language.
whatever
it's
belief
might
have
been,
it
didn't
enact
it
into
law.
nor
is
this
a
case
like
merrill
lynch,
where
congress
engaged
in
a
comprehensive
examination
and
revision
of
the
statutory
scheme,
so
that
what
it
left
untouched
it
could
be
said
to
have
approved.
that's
not
this
case
at
all.
the
1980
amendments
never
focused
on
retirement
cases
outside
of
the
context
of
these
involuntary
mental
disability
cases,
so
an
inference
can't
be
drawn,
we
think,
that
congress
intended
to
endorse
a
standard
of
review
in
other
cases
that
weren't
even
addressed
by
that
subject
matter,
or
by
scroggins
and
the
other
cases
that
congress
explicitly
focused
on.
and
in
fact
there
are
repeated
references
in
the
legislative
history
other...
you
mentioned
the
one
in
terms
of
expanded
review,
but
there
are
repeated
references
in
the
legislative
history
to
what
congress
was
doing
was
creating
an
exception
to
the
bar
to
judicial
review
that
existed.
congresswoman
spellman,
for
example,
the
sponsor
of
the
legislation,
said
on
the
floor
of
the
house
that
these
persons
are
denied
access
to
the
courts.
and
as
we
also
point
out
in
our
brief,
there
are
other
inconsistencies
in
the
legislative
history
of
the
1980
act,
even
narrowly
limited
to
agency-filed
mental
disability
cases.
we
think
that
that's
a
wholly
insubstantial
basis
on
which
to
undermine
what
the
federal
circuit
concluded
was
required
by
the
plain
language
of
the
act
and
its
similarity
to
the
other
federal
employment
benefit
schemes.
it's
also
important
to
point
out
that
in
scroggins
and
the
other
cases
the
court
was
focusing
on,
the
court
of
claims
never
granted
relief.
and
the
congress...
the
committee
was
dissatisfied
by
the
fact,
again
somebody
who
was
found
disabled
and
was
trying
to
get
his
job
back...
he
was
not
trying
to
get
an
annuity...
could
be
arbitrarily
treated,
and
was
trying
to
give
him
a
right
of
review.
and
there's
no
indication
it
was
focusing
on
the
question
of
somebody
who
was
trying
to
get
disability
benefits
and
to
affirm
the
right
of
review
in
those
cases.
thank
you.
