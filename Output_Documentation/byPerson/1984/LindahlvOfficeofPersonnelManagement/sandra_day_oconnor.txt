justice
o'connor
well
now,
mr.
murcko,
i
guess
you
have
to
persuade
us,
first
of
all,
that
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
federal
circuit
has
jurisdiction
by
virtue
of
section
7703,
do
you,
before
we
even
reach
the
8347(c)
question?
justice
o'connor
don't
you
have
a
preliminary
step?
justice
o'connor
well,
what
if
section
7703
deals
only
with
employees
or
applicants
for
employment
and
there
was
no
jurisdiction
conferred
at
all?
justice
o'connor
you
think
it
covers
retired
employees?
justice
o'connor
and
survivors?
justice
o'connor
but
mr.
kneedler,
if
you
are
correct
on
your
first
point,
then
we
don't
reach
this
question?
