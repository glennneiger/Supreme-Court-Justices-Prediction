justice
o'connor
mr.
white,
if
the
court
were
to
agree
with
you
in
this
case,
what
would
be
the
effect
on
the
garcias
here?
they
were
convicted
of
other
offenses
and
sentenced
to
consecutive
terms,
is
that
right,
for
the
other
offenses?
justice
o'connor
so
it
wouldn't
be
necessary
to
remand
for
any
alteration
of
any
sentence.
justice
o'connor
well,
yeah,
if
that
were
done,
the
other
sentences
would
stand
as
is,
right?
justice
o'connor
mr.
white,
could
the
government
have
charged
the
garcias
under
section
2112
in
this
case?
justice
o'connor
well,
mr.
ganzfried,
under
your
view,
someone
who
stole,
for
instance,
a
hammer
from
gsa
could
be
charged
under
this,
and
then
there'd
be
a
25-year
mandatory
sentence?
justice
o'connor
taken
in
a
robbery.
justice
o'connor
well,
you
would
say,
i
suppose,
that
the
prosecutor
simply
has
a
choice
whether
to
charge
him
under
2112
or
2114.
justice
o'connor
now,
if
we
thought
the
statute
was
clear
on
its
face,
are
there
any
circumstances,
in
your
view,
when
the
court
could
look
at
a
legislative
history...
if
there
ever
were
a
case,
this
would
be
it,
because
the
legislative
history
is
quite
clear,
it
seems
to
me,
that
a
postal
nexus
was
contemplated
by
congress.
justice
o'connor
well,
just
assume
that
for
a
minute,
would
you,
in
answering
the
question?
assume
the
legislative
history
is
clear
that
a
postal
nexus
was
contemplated.
are
there
any
circumstances
that
would
justify
the
court
in
looking
past
the
meaning?
justice
o'connor
as
expressed.
justice
o'connor
well,
suppose
the
committee
report
said
in...
in
language
as
plain
as
the
statutory
language
itself
we
intend
this
to
have
a
postal
nexus;
that's
the
intent
of
congress.
now,
could
the
court
look
behind
the
plain
meaning
of
the
statute
to
that
kind
of--
justice
o'connor
but
i
mean
that
enough
flexibility
would
have
been
present
using
those
two
statutes
to
still
give
the
term
that
was
given,
in
effect,
25
years.
justice
o'connor
do
you...
while
i
have
you
interrupted,
do
you
know
if
there
were
ever
any
prosecutions
for
robberies
of
nonpostal
employees
before
this
section
was
moved
to
title
18
under
this
section?
justice
o'connor
i
think
it
was
prior
to
1948.
justice
o'connor
you
see,
it
was
in
1948--
justice
o'connor
--think,
when
it
was
moved
from
the
postal
area
of
the
code
to
title
18.
and
i
just
wondered
if
there
were
ever
any
prosecutions
in
the
earlier
years
that
didn't
have
a
postal
nexus.
justice
o'connor
right.
justice
o'connor
and
i
guess
the
sg
did
take
a
contrary
position
to
the
one
you're
taking
now
for
quite
some
time
about
this.
justice
o'connor
i
see.
justice
o'connor
it's
the
attempt
thing
that
slips
through
the
cracks.
that's--
justice
o'connor
--right.
justice
o'connor
you
just
don't
want...
i
mean
you
would
prefer
not
to
have
the
attempt...
attempted
robbery
of
government
property
not
covered
by
one
of
these
two
sections.
justice
o'connor
well,
certainly
your
committee
report
is
contrary
to
dobbins'
remarks
on
the
floor.
