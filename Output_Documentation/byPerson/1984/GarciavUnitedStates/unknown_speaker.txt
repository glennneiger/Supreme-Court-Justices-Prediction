unknown
speaker
was
he
the...
what
was
his
position
on
the
committee?
was
he
a
subcommittee
chairman
or
what?
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
you
a
question
that
i...
i
haven't
really
been
able
to
think
through?
i
assume...
particularly
justice
o'connor's
reminded
us...
that
the
government
actually
did
not
make
use
of
this
statute
for
anything
except
postal
cases
at
least
until
after
1948,
really
in
only
a
handful
of
cases
since
then.
unknown
speaker
at
least
there
weren't
any
appeals.
but
assume
it,
assume
it
to
be
the
case
in
the
absence
of
really
definitive
evidence
that
the
practice
of
the
executive
branch
of
the
government
was
to
construe
the
statute
as
having
been
intended
to
relate
to
postal
nexus
cases.
unknown
speaker
which
i
know
you
don't,
and
it
certainly
had
changed
later,
at
least
in
some
cases.
and
if
we
are
to
look
primarily
at
the
contemporary
context
in
which
the
statute
was
enacted,
does
that
carry
any
weight
at
all?
i...
i
really
don't
know
whether
it
does...
the
executive's
practice
in--
unknown
speaker
--well,
generally
speaking,
in
the...
generally
speaking,
in
the
thirties
federal
criminal
law
was...
criminal
law
enforcement
was
basically
the
providence
of
the
states,
and...
and
the
business
of
the
federal
activity
in
law
enforcement
has
expanded
dramatically
in
the
last
10
or
15,
20
years.
in
that
context
i
just
wonder
if
we
wouldn't
have
had...
if
there
was
the...
the
purpose
that
the
plain
language
seems
to
suggest,
why
we
wouldn't
have
had
more
cases
other
than
postal
cases.
there's
a
lot
of
government
property
floating
around.
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
you
know
as
a
realistic
matter
how...
how
much
attention
a
bill
of
this
kind
gets
in
the
actual
deliberations
in
congress.
it's
fairly
routine.
unknown
speaker
which
committee
was
it
that
handled
this
bill?
unknown
speaker
is
there
any
other
criminal
law
of
general
application
that's
handled
by
the
post
office
committee?
unknown
speaker
so
they
could...
so
they
could
get
action.
unknown
speaker
i'm
just...
i
just
would
like
to
weight
that
and
consider
it
just
like
all
other
things
you've
been
talking
about,
which
might
be
of
no
interest
at
all.
unknown
speaker
congress
could
have
passed
the
bill
and
said
anybody
that
steals
government
money
goes
to
jail,
period.
you
wouldn't
have
any
of
this
trouble.
unknown
speaker
you
don't
consider
coming
up
here
trouble?
unknown
speaker
you
don't
consider
coming
up
here
trouble?
unknown
speaker
well,
you
were
brought
up
here,
were
you
not?
you
were
brought
up
here.
unknown
speaker
he
didn't
have
to
come.
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
can
i
ask
one
other
question
about
the
plain
language?
i
probably
should
have
read
more
cases
before
i
asked
this.
supposing
a
person
who's
not
a
government
employee
at
all
has
custody
of
an
unopened
letter
that's
written
to
his
brother
or
his
cousin
or
something,
and
then
he's
robbed
and
that
letter
is
stolen.
is
this
statute
violated?
unknown
speaker
it's
been
delivered.
the
letter's
been
delivered.
unknown
speaker
so
if
i
open
my
neighbor's
mailbox--
unknown
speaker
--do
you
think
that's
perfectly
clear
from
the
plain
language
of
the
statute?
do
you
think
that
limitation
is
clear
from
the
plain
language
of
the
statute,
that
the
lawful
custody
means
the
lawful
custody
during
the
transit
of
the
mail
as
opposed
to
some
later
period
of
time?
unknown
speaker
it's
no
longer
mail
matter.
unknown
speaker
well,
of
course,
that's
not
our
concern;
that's
congress'.
unknown
speaker
that...
perhaps
there's
not
that
disproportion
that
is
suggested,
because
some
of
these
hammers
are
pretty
expensive.
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
well,
if
it
were
a
coffee
pot
it
might
make
sense.
[laughter]
