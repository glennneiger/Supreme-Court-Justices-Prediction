justice
rehnquist
you
say
there
are
three
categories
there,
mr.
white?
mail
matter
is
one,
money
is
another,
and
other
property
is
the
third?
justice
rehnquist
well,
then...
but
the
word
"of"
does
not
appear
in
front
of
the
phrase
"other
property".
in
other
words,
the...
the
statute,
as
you
well
know
and
read,
"whoever
assaults
any
person
having
lawful
charge,
control
or
custody
of
any
mail
matter
or
any
money
or
other
property
of
the
united
states.
"
it
seems
to
me
if
your
construction
was
right,
it
would
read
"or
of
any
money
or
of
other
property
of
the
united
states.
"
do
you
see
what
i
mean?
justice
rehnquist
well,
i'm
not
the
court.
i'm
just
one
member
of
the
court,
and
i...
i
was
just
asking,
not
intimating
that
that
is
necessarily
the
correct
view.
but
it
seems
to
me
your
position
would
at
least
be
stronger
if
the
word
"of"
appeared
before
"other
property".
justice
rehnquist
i
presume
you
would
also
like
to
carry
out
the
intent
of
congress.
