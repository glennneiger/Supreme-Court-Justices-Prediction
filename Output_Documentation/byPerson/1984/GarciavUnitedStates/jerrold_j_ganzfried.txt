mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
our
position
is
that
section
2114
means
exactly
what
it
says.
the
statute
prohibits,
among
other
things,
the
robbery
of
a
lawful
custodian
of
government
property,
and
where
the
victim's
life
is
jeopardized
by
the
use
of
a
dangerous
weapon,
as
it
was
here,
the
penalty
is
enhanced.
now,
the
evidence
at
trial
showed
the
petitioners
committed
those
acts,
and
in
fact,
there
is
no
real
dispute
that
their
conduct
falls
within
the
statute's
plain
language.
petitioners
seek
to
avoid
these
consequences,
however,
by
suggesting
that
congress
meant
something
other
than
what
it
said
in
section
2114,
and
so
they
request
the
court
to
limit
the
statute
to
so-called
postal
crimes,
although
they
haven't
quite
told
us
what
that
is,
even
though
congress--
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
--yes.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
within
the
meaning
of
2114
it's...
it's
not.
it's
u.s.
currency
but--
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
--well,
it's...
it's...
it's
clear
for
two
reasons:
one,
because
the
phrase
that
follows
it
is
"other
property
of
the
united
states.
"
petitioners
have
read
the
word
"other"
out
of
the
statute.
it's
"money
or
other
property
of
the
united
states.
"
i
might
say
that
if
you're
suggesting
that
there's
an
ambiguity
as
to
whether
it
refers
to
u.s.
currency
or
property
of
the
united
states,
it
has
no
bearing
on
this
case
because
these
people
were
stealing
government
funds.
and,
in
fact,
our
reading
of
the
statute--
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
--if
they
lifted
his
wallet
and
took
money
that
he
was
going
to
take
for
a
bus
at
the
end
of
the
day.
that's
right.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
if
they
steal
the
hammer,
the
answer
is
no.
if
they
rob
the
hammer--
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
--if
it's
taken
in
a
robbery
and
its
government
property,
the
answer
is
yes,
it's
covered.
and
i
would
say
i
suppose
the
purpose
that
they
use
that
hypothetical
in
their
reply
brief
is
to
suggest
that
it's
unduly
harsh.
my
answer
to
that
is,
first,
if
it
does
appear
to
be
unduly
harsh,
that's
a
question
for
congress
to
determine;
and
second,
it's
too
broad...
it
proves
too
much
because
it
would
be
the
same
in
the
postal
situation.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
that's
right.
the
prosecutor
is
certainly
not
obligated
to
rely
on
2114.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
well,
i...
i...
i
disagree
with
that.
i
think
if
we're
looking
at
the
purpose
of
the
statute,
the
congressional
committee--
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
--not
here.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
not
here,
because
this...
the
statutory
language
is
clear.
there
is
no
need
to
resort
to
legislative
history
or
any
other
aids
to
resolve
any
uncertainty
because
there
is
no
uncertainty
to
resolve.
the
purpose
of
looking
to
the
legislative
history
is...
is--
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
--there's
no
rule
of
law
that
says
that
the
court
cannot
look
behind
the
plain
meaning
of
the
statute,
but
ordinarily
the
court
will
do
so
only
when
it's
seeking
to
resolve
an
ambiguity
on
the
face
of
the
statute.
we
would
also
add
that
the
court
has
said
in
the
past
that
a
statement
of
a
purpose
in
the
legislative
history
does
not
necessarily
mean
that
that
is
the
exclusive
purpose.
so
even
if
the
committee
reports
had
read
as...
as
you
suggest
in
your
hypothetical,
it
would
not
resolve
the
case.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
i'm
sorry.
i
didn't
hear
the
beginning
of
the
question.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
i
would...
i
would...
certainly
there
are
cases
that
narrow
the
language
of
statutes.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
my
recollection
is
that
there
have
been
rare
occasions
on
which
the
court
has
done
it.
frankly,
no
examples
come
to
mind
at
the
moment.
now--
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
--he
could
have,
but
2112
and
111
simply
specify
maximum
sentences,
not
the
mandatory
sentence
the
2114--
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
--the
court
could
have
done
that
if
it
were
so
inclined.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
prior
to
1935?
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
oh,
that
revision.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
the
revision
is
when--
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
--not
that
i'm
aware
of.
on
the
other
hand,
it...
it
depends
on
what
you
mean
by
the
phrase
"postal
nexus".
there
was
the
rondozo
case
that
the
petitioners
have
cited
in
their
brief,
decided
by
the
eighth
circuit
in
1924.
in
that
case
the
victim
was
the
son
of
the
postmaster,
and
he
was
not,
as
i
read
the
opinion
and
recall
it,
employed
by
the
post
office
department
at
the
time.
nonetheless,
it
was
found
that
covered
the
situation
simply
because
he
was
a
lawful
custodian.
in
one
sense
i
suppose
you
could
say
there
was
a
postal
nexus.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
but
possibly
not
the
postal
nexus
that
the
petitioners
are...
are
talking
about.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
well,
so
far
as...
as
far
as
i
know,
that
position
was
taken
in
hanahan,
and
it
was
the
only
time
that
the
solicitor
general
took
a
position
on
it.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
certainly,
the
issue...
pardon
me.
certainly,
cases
under
2114
that
did
not
involve
a
postal
nexus
had
come
to
the
court.
now,
this
particular
issue
had
not
been
raised.
i'm
thinking
now
of
one
of
the
two
earlier
cases,
either
the...
the
peek
case
or
the
sherman
case.
there
was
a
petition
for
cert
filed
in
one
of
them.
unfortunately,
the
citation
to
the
denial
of
cert
is
omitted
from
our
brief.
there
was
a
petition
for
cert
filed
in
the
case,
and
the
solicitor
general
took
the
position
that
cert
should
be
denied.
as
i
said,
this
issue
was
not
raised,
but
he
took
no
occasion
to
say
2114
requires
a
postal
nexus.
it
was
taken
only
in
hanahan,
and
it
was
taken
there
in
circumstances
where
the
2112
option
was
available
and
recommended
to
the
court
that
there
be
a
remand
for
resentencing
under
2112
and
to
treat
2114
as
a
miscitation
in
the...
in
the
indictment.
we
have
since
learned
in
the
second
rivera
case
in
the
second
circuit
that
there
will
be
occasions
when
the
2112
option
will
not
be
available
because
there
had
not
been
a
completed
robbery
under
2114,
only
an
attempt,
which
2112
doesn't
cover.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
well,
the
attempt
that's
covered
by
2114,
that
is
not
covered
by
2112.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
and
so
having...
having
learned
that
the
2112
option
is
not
always
available
to
us,
having
discovered
the
peek
and
sherman
cases
that
apparently
the
solicitor
general
was
not
aware
of
in
1973,
and
having
looked
at
this
court's
more
recent
cases
on
the
reading
of
statutes,
particularly
criminal
statutes,
and
the
great
attention
that's
to
be
paid
to
the
plain
meaning
enacted
by
congress
as
the
best
and
most
reliable
evidence
of
congressional
intent,
when
this
case
came
along
we
took
another
look
at
it
since--
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
--well,
we
would
prefer
that.
we
would
also
prefer
to
have
2114
available
to
prosecutors
within
their
discretion
when
the
circumstances
warrant.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
absolutely,
absolutely.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
no.
that
was...
that
was
an
appeal
by
sherman.
that
was
a
conviction.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
yes.
that
was
the
court
of
appeals
caption.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
sherman
did
the
appealing,
yes.
and
sherman...
and,
i'm
sorry,
as
i
look
at
it
i
see
we
do
have
cert
denied.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
when
cert
denied,
the
title
was
sherman
v.
the
united
states.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
as
i
understand
it,
that's
the
way
courts
of...
courts
of
appeals
ordinarily
use
the
captions
that
district
courts
use.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
well,
it
may,
and
i...
my
recollection
of
the
reading
of
the
sherman
case
was
that
it
was
a
conviction
and
an
appeal
by
sherman.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
yes.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
that's
right.
now,
the
issue
was
not
raised
in
sherman,
or
in
peek,
or
in
the
o'neill
case,
an
earlier
ninth
circuit
case.
but
they
were
prosecutions
that
were
under
2114,
and
they
had
no
postal
nexus
by
any
stretch
of
the
imagination.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
that's
right.
the
issue
was
raised
for
the
first
time
in
the
petition
for
cert.--
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
--i've
made
inquiries
on
that,
and
my
understanding
is
that
it's
not.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
i
can
check
further
on
that,
and
if
what
i've
just
said
is
in
error,
i
will
certainly
advise
the
court.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
the
basis
of
the
concession--
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
--oh,
i
see.
well,
the
basis
for
the
concession
in
hanahan
was
primarily
the
statement
by
congressman
dobbins.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
absolutely.
in
fact,
let
me
read
from
our
memorandum
of
the
case.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
we
said,
"on
its
face
the
statute
covers
the
crime
for
which
petitioner
was
convicted.
"
we
relied
on
congressman
dobbins'
statement.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
which...
which
was...
which
was
a
snippet
then
and
which
is
a
snippet
today.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
it
hasn't
gotten
any
longer
since
he
said
it
in
1935.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
three
snippets
and...
and
3
7/8
of
them
are
consistent
with
our
position.
in
fact,
if
what
we're
trying
to
do...
and
we
are...
is
to
determine
what
congress'
intent
was,
they
made
it
quite
easy;
because
if
the
question
is
what
was
congress'
purpose,
the
committee
report
says
the
purpose
of
this
bill
is
to
bring
within
the
provisions
of
the
penal
code
the
crime
of
robbing
or
attempting
to
rob
custodians
of
government
monies.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
there
was
an
amendment
in
1935.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
apparently
not.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
apparently
not.
now,
let
me
address
two
arguments
that
the
petitioners
have
made
on
the
face
of
the
statute.
it
had
been
their...
it
had
been
my
understanding
of
this
case
up
until
a
week
ago
that
there
was
no
real
dispute,
but
that
on
its
face
2114
clearly
covers
the
conduct
here.
and
we
take
the
position,
as
we
do
in
our
brief,
that
there's
no
need
to
go
beyond
the
statutory
language.
it's
not
a
case
where
the
words
are
unclear,
ambiguous
or
imprecise.
and
since
there
were
not
two
plausible
readings
that
were
suggested,
there
was
no
reason
to
go
any
further
to
choose
between
any
two...
any
such
readings.
now,
it
wasn't
until
they
filed
their
reply
brief
last
week
and
in
their
argument
today
that
they
ever
really
suggested
an
ambiguity
in
2114.
they've
changed
their
tune,
and
they
recently
discovered
an
ambiguity
which,
as
i
understand
it,
is
that
the
term
"money"
is
unclear
in
that
it
could
either
refer
to
government
funds,
or
it
could
refer
to
any
money.
and
i
submit,
as
i
said
in
response
to
a
question
earlier,
that
it
doesn't
matter
for
purposes
of
this
case,
because
what
were
stolen
were
government
funds.
and
in
any
event,
the
statute,
in
our
view,
does
cover
only
government
funds.
they
also
make
this
morning
an
argument
under
the
doctrine
of
ejusdem
generis,
and
we
submit
on
that
that
the
doctrine
is
inapplicable
here
and
should
be
rejected
for
essentially
the
reasons
that
the
court
rejected
it
in
the
powell
case
that's
cited
in
petitioners
reply
brief
and
in
the
turkette
case,
namely
that
it's
an
aid
to
construction
that
comes
into
play
when
there's
some
uncertainty
in
the
language.
here
there
is
no
uncertainty.
each
category
is
separate,
and
there
is
no
common
characteristic
that
runs
through
the
three
categories.
in
essence,
we
don't
have
a
statute
that
has
a
long
list
of
specific
items
followed
by
a
catch-all
phrase
at
the
end.
in
fact,
the
case
on
which
they
rely,
the
stever
case,
my
recollection
of
the
statute
in
that
case
in
1916
was
that
the
catch-all
phrase
at
the
end
said
something
like
"or
other
similar"
items
to
the
items
that
it
pursued.
we
have
nothing
of
that
sort
here.
now,
as
i
said,
there's
no
rule
of
law
that
prevents
the
court
from
looking
at
the
legislative
history.
our
position
on
that
is
that
when
you
look
at
it
and
you
take
the
legislative
history
as
a
whole,
it
supports
us.
i
think
we
have
to
keep
things
in
perspective;
that--
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
--he
did.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
i...
i
don't
know
quite
what
happened
in
the
follow
up
in
the
hanahan
case.
i
know
that
hanahan
was
resentenced,
but
he
took--
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
--i
assume--
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
--i
assume
that
it
did.
the
solicitor
general,
however,
has...
has
now
come
to
a
different
conclusion
under
the
same
statute.
as
this
court
said
unanimously
in
mendoza
last
year--
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
--well,
the
ease
with
which
one
can
have
legislative
history
rewrite
a
statute--
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
--the
view...
the
view
has--
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
--presumably
it
has.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
well,
two
things.
first
of
all,
one
of
the
suggestions
that
mr.
walcott
made
was
adopted.
the
reason
that
i...
that
i
don't
share
that
concern
about
the
significance
of
congressman
dobbins'
comments
is
first
of
all
that
they
have
to
be
understood
in
context.
he
was
not
offering
an
explanation
of
the
scope
of
the
bill.
he
was
not
offering
a
definition
of
the
terms
that
are
at
issue
here.
he
was
responding
to
criticism
of
the
bill
on
an
altogether
different
subject,
namely
the
mandatory
nature
of
the
25-year
sentence.
in
responding
to
that
in
which
he
was
pointing
out
that
the
amendment
was
not
changing
it...
the
statute
as
it
already
existed
had
a
25-year
mandatory
sentence...
he
added
that
all
we're
doing
is,
as
you
said,
but
he
was
not
offering
an
explanation
of
the
meaning
of
the
statute.
second,
another
reason
why
the
comment
is
not
entitled
to
that
weight
is
that
it's
inconsistent
with
the
words
of
the
statute,
and
it's
inconsistent
with
the
report
of
the
committee
of
which
congressman
dobbins
was
a
member.
and
as
this
court
has
said,
comments
made
in
colloquies
are
hazardous
bases
for
assuming
what
congress'
intent
was.
those...
the
speeches
are
available
only
to
the...
or
heard
by
the
members
who
happen
to
be
there
that
day,
whereas
the
statutory
language
is...
is
what
is
actually
presented
to
all
members
of
congress,
commands
a
majority
vote
in
both
houses
and
is
signed
by
the
president.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
well,
we
don't
know
why
it
was
passed,
but
it
seems
to
me
it...
i
mean
we
can't
look
into
the
inner
workings
of
the
minds
of
the
members
of
congress.
all
we
can
work
with
is
the
record
that
they've
left.
and
in
trying
to
seek
out
the
trail
towards
congressional
intent,
the
largest
and
best
signpost
we
have
is
the
words
of
the
statute
they
passed.
and
it
would
seem
to
me--
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
--absolutely.
absolutely.
it
doesn't--
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
--no,
not...
not
that
we're
aware
of.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
i...
i
don't
know
what
his
position
was
on
the
committee.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
well,
i...
i
tried
to
find
out
the
answer
to
that,
just
how
many
cases
there
were
that
were
prosecuted
under
2114,
and
unfortunately,
we...
i
could
not
find
any
records
to
answer
that,
and
so
the
response
that
i
gave
to
justice
o'connor
was
based
on
what
i
could
find
in
the
reported
decisions.
there
may
well
have
been
prosecutions.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
i'll
assume
that.
i
won't
necessarily
agree.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
if
what
you're
suggesting
is
that
we
try
to
engage
in
some
pseudopsychology
to
determine
what
individual
congressmen
were
thinking
about--
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
--well,
let
me,
i
think,
recast
that
question.
i
think
if...
if
that
was
congress'
intent,
first
of
all,
it's
a
simple
matter
for
them
to
say
any
postal
employee
in
the
statute
or
any
property
of
the
post
office
department.
it
also
seems
to
me
that
if
this
language
really
does
run
far
beyond
what
congress
intended
that
someone
would
have
raised
the
question
and
said
look
at
what
we're
doing
here.
this
isn't
limited
to
the
post
office.
this
says
any
property
of...
of
the
government.
and
the
committee
report--
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
--well,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
language
of
the
bill
would
get
more
attention
than
the
comments
that
congressman
dobbins
made
on
the
floor.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
this
bill
was
handled
by
the
post
office
committee.
there
were
two
predecessor
bills
that
were
virtually
identical.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
offhand
i
can't
think
of
any,
but
i
can
tell
you
that
the
two
predecessors
to
this
bill
were,
when
introduced,
identical
to
it,
were
referred
to
the
judiciary
committee.
no
action
was
taken
in
the
committee,
and
so
in
1935
when
it
was
reintroduced
it
went
to
the
postal
committee.
if
i
had
to
guess--
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
--it
got
action,
and
it
got
action
from
the
full
congress.
i
would
guess
that
it
was
simply
a
matter
of...
of
political
expedience,
that
there
was
a
bill
that
was
needed,
and...
and
a
way
was
found
to
get
it
through
congress.
the
bill
itself
is...
is
just
as
broad,
no
matter
what
the
source,
no
matter
what
committee
it
comes
from.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
it
would
be
a
somewhat
peculiar
mode
of
statutory
construction
to
go
back
50
years
later
and
tell
congress
that
it
sent
the
bill
to
the
wrong
committee,
that
it
has
to
do
it
right
if
it...
if
it
wants
to
pass
criminal
laws.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
what
we
can
do
is
make
our
submissions
for
the
court's
consideration
and...
and
hope
that
we're
persuasive.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
well,
we
don't
think
we
have
that...
that
trouble.
it
already
had
a
statute
that
says
anyone
who
steals
government
property
goes--
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
--pardon
me?
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
it's
an
effort,
but
it's
a
pleasure.
it's
not
trouble.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
that's
right.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
well,
since
it's
a
case
in
which
i...
i
believe
that
our
position
is
rather
simple,
we
don't
have
to
revise
the
statute,
and
i'd
suggest
that
in
order
to...
to
read
into
the
statute
the
limitation
that
the
petitioners
propose,
you
would
have
to
revise
the
statute.
you
would
have
to
read
in
and
insert
language
that
congress
certainly
could
have
used
in
1935
and
had
at
that
point
in
numerous
other
criminal
laws
relating
to
the
post
office.
and
we've
identified
some
of
those
at
pages
16
and
17
of
our
brief.
they
knew
how
to
do
it.
they
didn't
do
it.
they
chose
instead
the
broad
language
of
this
statute,
and
they
stated
clearly
in
both
committee
reports
that
the
purpose
was
to
protect
custodians
of
government
monies.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
i'll
have
to
ask
you
a
follow
up
fact
to
be
able
to
answer
it.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
it's
been
delivered.
i
think
our
position
on
that
is
that
once
it's
been
delivered,
it's
not
mail
matter
under
the
terms
of
the
statute.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
which
would
be
consistent,
i
believe,
with
our
position
under
section
1708
which
covers
thefts.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
i
think
it
is,
because
i
think
ordinarily
once
mail
is
delivered,
taking
the
ordinary
meaning
of
the
words,
that
once
it's
delivered,
it's...
it's
a
letter,
it's
not
mail.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
no
longer
mail
matter.
oh,
incidentally,
there
is
one
point
that
i
shouldn't
sit
down
without
commenting
on,
and
that
is
the
business
about
this
comma.
i
don't
think
it's
terribly
important
either
way,
but
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
in
the
section
of
the
statute
that
covers
what
these
petitioners
did,
there
is
a
comma.
it's
on
page
2,
it's
the
fourth
line
in
our
brief.
these
people
were
charged
with...
with
robbery
of
the...
of
the
lawful
custodian
of
government
property.
and
the
portion
of
the
statute
that
covers
robbery
says,
"whoever
robs
any
such
person
of
mail
matters.
"
comma,
"or
of
any
money",
comma,
"or
other
property
of
the
united
states.
"
so
on
and
so
forth.
so
i
don't
think
there
was
much
to
that
argument
to
begin
with,
but
in
fact,
the
comma
on
which
it
was
based
or
the
absence
on
which
it
was
based
is
there.
thank
you.
