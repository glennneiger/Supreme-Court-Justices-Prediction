mr.
white,
can
i...
can
i
interrupt
you?
i...
i'm
troubled
by
your
comma
argument,
because
i
don't
understand
why
the
comma
would
be
any
more
significant
than
what
justice
rehnquist
pointed
out
as
there
are
just
two
"ofs".
i
mean
it
seems
to
me
they...
the
fact
there
are
only
two
"ofs"
supports
the
notion
there
are
two
clauses,
and
you
can't
have
three
clauses
with
only
two
"ofs".
i
just
don't
follow
your
comma
argument.
maybe
i--
justice
stevens
let
me
interrupt
on
the
plain
language
point
just...
it's
something
that
always
troubled
me.
i
have
in
my
pocket
a
dollar
bill.
justice
stevens
is
that
money
of
the
united
states
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute?
justice
stevens
so
the
language
doesn't...
isn't
quite
as
clear
as...
as
its
face
would
indicate.
i
would
think
money
of
the
united
states
would
be
these
green
bills
that
i
carry
around
from
time
to
time.
justice
stevens
but
under
your
view
it
would
not
have...
they
would
not
have
violated
this
statute
if
the
agent
had
not
had
government
funds
but
had
his
own
money
which
he
intended
to
get
reimbursed
for.
justice
stevens
am
i
correct
in
remembering
then
the
hanahan
case
in
the
seventh
circuit,
the
issue
wasn't
raised
in
the
court
of
appeals,
was
it?
justice
stevens
may
i
also
ask,
is
this
question
the
subject
of
the
recent
legislation
that
congress,
i
understand,
has
passed
some
comprehensive
criminal
legislation?
justice
stevens
it's
not.
justice
stevens
of
course,
the
whole
legislative
history
is
only
about
three
snippets.
