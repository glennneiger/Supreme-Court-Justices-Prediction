mr.
charles
g.
white
mr.
justice...
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
is
a
case
of
statutory
construction.
the
statute
involved
is
found
in
section
2114
of
title
18
of
the
united
states
code.
it
prescribes
the
robbery
and
attempted
robbery
of
anyone
in
lawful
custody
or
control
of
mail
matter
of
any
money
or
other
property
of
the
united
states.
the
statute
was
amended
or
had
been
amended
in
1935
to
add
in
the
words
"or
any
money
or
other
property
of
the
united
states.
"
to
what
had
previously
been
known
exclusively
as
the
postal
robbery
statute
affecting
only
matters
dealing
with
the
post
office.
the
question
before
this
court
is
whether
or
not
congress
intended
to
expand
the
scope
of
that
statute
to
encompass
any
custodian
of
any
money
or
government
property
that
they
would
prosecute
under
the
statute.
now,
the
government
has,
of
course,
adopted
that
position
based
on
what
they
consider
to
be
the
plain
reading
and
unambiguous
wording
of
that
statute.
petitioners
contend
that
in
fact
the
statute
is
not
unambiguous
and
that
the...
it
suffers
from
various
defects
in
the
way
that
it's
worded,
and
we
will
be
in
a
position
to
argue
that.
in
addition,
petitioners
feel
that
the
congressional
intent
is
certainly
relevant,
and
i
would
say
controlling,
as
to
what
it
was
that
congress
intended
to
do
when
in
fact
they
amended
the
statute.
petitioners
will
also
propose
to
this
court
an
alternative,
what
we
believe
is
in
fact
the
plain
meaning
of
the
statute
that
comports
with
congressional
intent;
and
that
is
an...
that
will
involve
the
application
of
an
ancient
rule,
a
well-respected
rule
of
statutory
construction
called
the
rule
of
ejusdem
generis.
now,
the
facts
in
this
case
are
not
totally
pertinent
to
the
legal
issue
involved,
but
some
of
them
should
be
gone
into
in
order
to...
to
give
some
background
to
the
court.
the
petitioners
were
two
brothers,
jose
and
francisco
garcia,
who
back
in
july
of
1981
were
engaged
in
negotiations
with
an
undercover
agent
from
the
united
states
secret
service
for
the
purpose
of
selling
or
buying
counterfeit
money.
now,
the...
francisco...
the
garcia
brothers
represented
to
agent
holmes
that
they
would
be
in
a
position
to
sell
him
counterfeit
money
in
exchange
for
real
money.
they
had
a
meeting
in
a
park
in
miami,
florida
in
the
evening
in
which
agent
holmes
had
brought
some
government
money
which
was
kept
in
a
pouch.
the
negotiations
apparently
were
not
to
be
had,
because
jose
garcia
did
pull
out
a
gun
and
train
it
upon
agent
holmes,
and
francisco
garcia
climbed
into
the
car
that
agent
holmes
had
driven
to
the
scene
and
escaped
with,
or
tried
to
escape
with
the
pouch
containing
the
real
money.
the
backup
agents
that
were
with
agent
holmes
were
approaching
the
scene
to
affect
arrests.
one
of
their
cars
hit
francisco
garcia,
knocking
him
to
the
ground,
and
francisco
garcia
was
taken
into
custody,
as
was
jose
garcia.
now,
they
were...
these
two
individuals
were
prosecuted
and
tried
in
front
of
a
jury
in
district
court
in
the
southern
district
of
florida.
this
issue
that's
before
the
court
was
not
raised
by
the
trial
attorney
for
the
petitioners.
the
issue
was
not
raised
until
the
brief
was
filed
with
the
eleventh
circuit,
and
the
eleventh
circuit
permitted
the
issue
to
be
argued
and
decided
on
its
merits.
in
the
eleventh
circuit
opinion
the
conclusion
was
that
the
statute
seemed
very
plain
and
unambiguous.
basically,
the
government's
position
was
adopted,
and
the
petitioners
were...
had
their
convictions
affirmed.
i
had
stated
in
the
very
beginning
that
i
intended
to
show
that
the
statute
was
in
fact
ambiguous,
and
i
think
that
the
way
to
understand
it
is
to
look
at
the
way
in
which
the
government
is
contending
the
statute
should
be
read.
by
looking
at
the
words
themselves
you
have
a
very
unusual
situation
here.
you
have
three
clauses
that
are
separated
by
a
disjunctive
"or".
the
government
has
argued
that
in
fact
there
are
two
clauses
separated
by
a
disjunctive
"or",
and
that
one
clause
being
mail
matter,
and
then
thereby
that...
those...
that
phrase
which
was
added
by
congress
in
1935
encompasses
one
category
of
things
to
be
prohibited.
and
the
government
presumes
that
the
intention
of
congress
in
reading
that
statute
was
to
have
"property
of
the
united
states",
"other
property
of
the
united
states.
"
modify
the
preceding
phrase
which
is
"any
money".
well,
in
the
same
breath
the
government
contends,
and
the
eleventh
circuit
seemed
to
accept
this
argument
at
the
time,
that
the
use
of
the
disjunctive
always
establishes
completely
and
wholly
separate
categories
of
crimes.
in
order
to
determine
or
to
rule
that
the
plain
reading
of
this
statute
establishes
that,
you
have
to
take
away
from
mail
matter
the
other
parts
that
were
added
in
1935.
otherwise,
you
may
have,
in
fact,
what
the
petitioners
contend,
which
is
a
statute
which
was
only
designed
to...
to
close
what
was
perceived
in
1935
to
be
a
loophole
in
the
postal
robbery
statute.
now,
how
does
this...
how
does
this
work?
if
we
take
each
different
category
that's
separated
by
the
disjunctive,
we
have
mail
matter
is
the
first
category,
and
there's
no
dispute
as
to
what
that
means.
there's
a
long
history
of
case
law
and
a
pedigree
which
goes
all
the
way
back
to
1792
that
regards
this
particular
part
of
the
statute,
or
"any
money".
what
was
it
that
"any
money"
means?
surely,
if
the
category
has
to
stand
by
itself,
then
is
not
going
to
be
used
to
modify
"any
money".
we
don't
have
a
situation
here
where
the
plain
reading
of
the
statute
says
that
"any
money
of
the
united
states.
"
we
also
have
a
situation
where
it
would
have
made
"any
money"
a
redundant
statement.
as
in
section
2112
of
the
united
states
code
in
title
18,
robbery
of
government
property
has
been
ruled
quite
conclusively
to
include
government
money.
the
only
purpose
that
congress
could
have
had
for
putting
"any
money"
as
a
separate
clause
was
that
they
were
contemplating
that
there
would
be
other
money
over
which
congress
could
assert
jurisdiction
that
was
not
government
property.
and
i
submit
to
the
court
that
what
they
were
discussing
and
what
they
contemplated
was
the
money
which
would
be
in
the
possession
of
those
who
would
normally
possess
mail
matter.
material
other
than
mail
matter
the
statute
was
designed
to
protect.
and
there's
another
way
when
you
look
at
the
statute
as
a
whole
that
this
type
of
an
argument
and
this
type
of
ambiguity
begins
to
make
more
and
more
sense.
before
we
get
to
the
articles
which
a
lawful
custodian
would
have
custody
of...
the
mail
matter
or
any
money
or
other
property
of
the
united
states...
we
have
the
situation
of
a...
who
is
a
lawful
custodian
of
these...
these
properties.
again,
this
is
a
statute
which
has
been
around
for
a
long
time.
case
law
has
been
established
as
to
a
lawful
custodian
of
mail
matter.
lawful
custodians...
different
courts
have...
have
looked
at
the...
at
postal
regulations,
different
courts
have
looked
at
private
business
people
who
run
a
post
office
on
a
contractual
basis
and
ruled
that
those
people
are
in...
in
custody
of
mail
matter.
the
courts
have...
have
ruled
on
this
issue.
congress
is
presumed
to
have
known
what
the
precedents
were
when
it
added
these...
these
other
categories
to
mail
matter
or
any
money
or
other
property
of
the
united
states.
they
knew
what
a
lawful
custodian
of
these
matters
were,
and
there's
no
indication
in
the
statute
that
they
intended
to
set
up
any
other
standard
for
determining
what
it
was
that
constituted
a
lawful
custodian.
now,
the
petitioners
contend
that
these
types
of
problems
are
all
based...
and
really
the
reason
why
we
are
here
before
this
court
is
because
the
government
was
able
to
convince
the
eleventh
circuit,
of
course,
that
there
was
only
two
clauses
with
the
"or".
but
if
you
look
at
the
opinion
below,
which
we
have
petitioned
this
court
to
review,
you
will
see
that
there
is
a
major
glaring
mistake
that
was
made
in
that
opinion.
and
that
is
that
the
writer
of
that
opinion
presumed
that
there
was
a
comma
between
the
words
"mail
matter"
and
the
clause
and,
in
fact,
the
united
states
code
does
not
contain
a
comma
in
that
place.
there
is
no
separation
in
the
two
categories.
the
separation
is
into
three
categories
under
a
plain
meaning
of
the
statute.
now,
going
back
to
the
analysis
of
what
kind
of
any
money
they
were
talking
about
and
other
government
property,
we
now
see
that
congress
must
have
intended
when
reading
the
statute
in
its
plain
and
unambiguous
fashion
that
somehow
the
various
phrases
would
be
related
to
each
other;
that
the
different
categories
that
the
congress
was
intending
to
protect
would
be
related
to
each
other.
mr.
charles
g.
white
yes,
your
honor.
they
were
sentenced...
jose
was
sentenced
to
a
40-year
term
of
which
25
years
was
for
this
particular
offense,
and
francisco
was
sentenced
to
a
30-year
term.
mr.
charles
g.
white
well,
yes,
your
honor,
the
petitioners
in
their
prayer
for
relief
were
asking
that
this
court
order
the
district
court
to
dismiss
the
count
3
in
the
indictment
which
charges
this
violation
of
section
2114.
mr.
charles
g.
white
that's
correct,
your
honor.
now,
to
proceed,
if
i
may,
when
you
look
at
the...
at
the
statute
as
it's
written,
the
different
categories,
mail
matter
or
any
money
or
other
property
of
the
united
states,
it's
clear
that
you
have
a
specific
term--
mr.
charles
g.
white
--that's
correct.
mr.
charles
g.
white
well,
your
honor,
the...
you
are
correct,
of
course,
in
your...
in
that
part
of
the
analysis.
this
is
one
of
the
reasons
why
it's
necessary
to,
in
cases
of
this
nature,
to
go
back
and
determine
what
it
was
that
congress
intended.
perhaps
the
court
is
correct.
perhaps
it
was
congress'
intention
if
they
wanted
to
have
three
categories
that
they
would
have
put
the
"of"
there.
mr.
charles
g.
white
well,
that
may
be
the
case,
your
honor.
however,
i
think
that
the...
the
basic
position
on
the
point
of
ambiguity
is
really
what
we're
discussing,
and
we're
playing
with
these
words,
and
we're
trying
to
figure
out
what
exactly
they
mean
when
one
looks
at
them
plainly
and
sees
whether
or
not
the
guidance
that
those
words
give
is
sufficient
to
override
any
concern
with
what
it
was
that
congress
actually
intended
when
they
decided
to...
to
enact--
mr.
charles
g.
white
--well,
he
did
back
about
ten
years
ago,
your
honor.
he
did
agree
with
the
position.
the
second
circuit
and
the
ninth
circuit
had--
mr.
charles
g.
white
--well,
it
was
a
seventh
circuit
case,
the
united
states
v.
hanahan,
in
which
the
solicitor
general
had
filed
his...
his
concession
in
his
memorandum--
mr.
charles
g.
white
--it's
my
understanding
of
that...
my...
my
understanding
of
it
was
that
the
concession
was
based
mostly
on...
on
legislative
history.
it
was
going
back
and
looking
at
the
intent
of
congress;
that
it
was
really...
the
beauty
of
a
plain
and
unambiguous
reading
of
the
words
as
they
appear
is
that
by
having
a
specific
term
like
"mail
matter"
followed
by
terms
of
normally
general
meaning
that
relate
to
each
other,
applying
this
principle
of
ejusdem
generis,
you
have
conclusively
the
class
enumerated
by
mail
matter,
the
money
in
the
possession
of
those
who
would
be
in
custody
of
mail
matter,
and
the
property
that
would
be
in
their
possession
or
custody.
mr.
charles
g.
white
your
honor,
my
understanding
of
the
history
of
the
hanahan
case
was
that
you
did...
you're
totally
correct.
it
was
remanded
for
consideration.
what
the
district
court
did--
mr.
charles
g.
white
--no,
your
honor.
we're
not...
i'm
not...
i'm
not
contending--
mr.
charles
g.
white
--that
we're
here
on
the--
mr.
charles
g.
white
--the
seventh
circuit
did
agree
with
their...
with
their
conclusion.
mr.
charles
g.
white
and
apparently
mr.
hanahan's
account
was
vacated,
and
he...
they
imposed
a...
a
conviction
under
2112,
i
believe,
on
those
facts,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
g.
white
yes,
they
could
have,
your
honor.
they
could
have
charged
them
under
2112.
the
question,
of
course,
that
may
be
decided
if
this
case
is
remanded
back
is
whether
or
not
since
they
have
also
convicted
the
garcias
under
641,
theft
of
government
property,
whether
or
not
it
would
be
appropriate
at
this
point
to
impose
additional
penalties
under
2112.
all
of
what
i've
said
before
about
the
wording
in
attempting
to
answer
the
questions
of
the
court
tries
to
get
us
past
the
threshold
question
which
caused
this
case
not
to...
i
believe
not
to
be
fully
considered
by
the
eleventh
circuit.
and
that
was
to
go
right
into
the
issue
of
what
it
was
that
congress
was
intending
to
do
in
1935
when
they
added
those
words
"or
any
money
or
other
property
of
the
united
states.
"
to
the
statute.
there
are
certainly...
i
believe
the
petitioners
have...
have
successfully
shown
that
there
are
two
interpretations
of
this...
of
the
plain
reading
of
the
statute:
one
based
on
the...
my
arguments
and
based
on...
on
established
rules
of
statutory
construction.
and
i
submit
that
the...
the
others
the
government
proposes
are
based
more
on
what
they
would
like
the
law
to
be
rather
than
what
it
was
that
congress
intended
the
law
to
be.
going
back
into
the
history
of
the
1935
amendment
we
see
that
there
really
wasn't
the
kind
of
comprehensive
hearings,
the
kind
of
comprehensive
input
from
other
federal
law
enforcement
agencies
that
one
would
assume
would
happen
if
the
government
was
actually
planning
on
enacting
a
statute
of
the
sweeping
scope
which
the...
the
government
would
have
you
believe
they
intended
to
do.
really,
the...
the...
a
letter
from
the
postmaster
general
was
the
only...
was
the
only
part
of
the
committee
reports,
aside
from
indications
of
various...
various
amendments
that
were
being
proposed
on
some
phraseology
changes.
that
letter
from
the
postmaster
general
reflected
his
concern
that
the
law
of
2114,
which
at
that
time
was
found
in
section
320
of
title
18,
smack
in
the
middle
of
all
the
postal
offenses,
that
that
was
very
good
protection
for
those
custodians
of
mail.
however,
he
was
pointing
out
a
rise
in
incidents
of
robberies
of
custodians
of
other
materials
besides
mail.
now,
it
was
a
letter.
it
wasn't
drafted
in
such
a
way
that
it
was
going
to...
the
way
the
letter
was
drafted
was
going
to
become
law.
the
government
in
their
brief
made
some
issue
about
the
fact
that
he
says
"custodians
of
money
or
other
property.
"
as
opposed
to
saying
mailman
or
letter
carrier.
well,
that
makes
a
lot
of
sense
that
he
would
just
use
the
term
"custodians
of
money"
when
he's
the
postmaster
general
and
he's
writing
a
letter
to
the
post
office
committee
in
the
house
of
representatives,
and
he's
talking
about
concerns
of
his
own
which
are
for
his
employees.
what
he
was
concerned
about...
and
the
statement
of
congressman
dobbins
on
the
floor
of
the
house
of
representatives
underscores
this...
what
he
was
concerned
about
were
people
coming
in
and
robbing
post
offices
not
of
letters,
not
of
mail
matter,
but
of
money.
and
he
wanted
to
make
sure
that
the...
a
loophole,
that
this
loophole
in
the
statute
was
covered
so
that
they
could
use
the
statute
with
its
very
stringent
mandatory
sentence
if
a
firearm
or
dangerous
weapon
was
used,
they
could
use
the
statute
to
protect
postal
employees
or
those
who
have
lawful
custody
of
mail
matter
or
other
property
that
would
be
in
the
possession
or
control
of
the
postal
function.
this
is
really
what
got
this
whole
statute
started,
the
whole
amendment
process
started
with
this
letter,
with
this
request
that
this
loophole
be
closed.
now,
congressman
dobbins,
as
the
government
points
out,
was
never
ordained
a
"floor
manager",
in
quotation
marks.
congressman
dobbins,
however,
if
you
turn
to
the
congressional
record
and
turn
back
a
few
pages
from
where
the
various
quoted
excerpts
on
this
bill
are,
or
move
back...
up
a
few
pages,
you'll
see
that
congressman
dobbins
was
from
the
post
office
committee,
and
he
was
apparently
in
charge
of
shepherding
quite
a
few
bills
cut
of
that
committee
through
the
house
of
representatives.
and
he
was
the
one
that
they
would
turn
to
when
they
wanted
to
ask
a
question
or
what
does
this
mean;
what
does
this
bill
really
do;
is
this
bill
this
or
that?
and
he
would
answer
the
question
because,
as
he
told
them,
he
was
consulting
with
the
lawyers,
the
attorneys
that
worked
for
the
postmaster
general
trying
to
construct
the
wording
of
a
statute
that
would
simply
and
easily
close
the
loophole
that
he
was
concerned
about.
there's
another
indication
that
the...
that
this
is
what
congress
intended.
there
was
some
discussion
in
the
government's
brief
to
the
effect
that
the...
there
was...
just
because
there
was
silence
on
this
issue
from
other
law
enforcement
agencies,
that
does
not
necessarily
mean
that
they
weren't
interested
in
the
result.
well,
one
year
before,
one
year
before
this
amendment
was
enacted,
the
congress
considered
a
letter
from
the
attorney
general...
i
believe
it
was
to
the
house
or
senate
judiciary
committee...
regarding
the
enactment
of
what
later
became
section
111
of
title
18.
in
that...
in
that
letter,
the
attorney
general,
of
course,
as
the
case...
as
this
court
remembers
from
the
united
states
v.
viola
case
where
the
congressional
intent
behind
111
was...
was
explored,
the
attorney
general
mentioned
that
he
was
concerned,
of
course,
about
the
jurisdiction
of
the
federal
courts
over
protecting
law
enforcement
officers.
he
mentioned
in
the
back...
back
part
of
the
letter
about
how
other
people
are
trying
to...
other
federal
agencies
are
trying
to
protect
their
employees
as
well,
and
he
mentioned
specifically
the
post
office
is
trying
to
protect
assaults
on
letter
carriers.
so
even
the
attorney
general
at
that
time,
and
one
year
before
this
1935
amendment,
he
got
his
extra
protection
for
situations
of
this
nature.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
both
the
petitioners
were
charged
under...
under
section
111
in
addition
to
section
2114,
and
jose
garcia
was
convicted,
and
francisco
garcia
was
acquitted
of
that
count
by
the
jury.
when
one
takes
the
entire
context
of
this
bill,
of
this
amendments,
looking
at
the
ambiguity
and
the
two
different
ways
in
which
the
statute
can
be
read,
it
becomes
clear
that
congressional
intent
would
control
under
these
circumstances.
applying
the
rule
of
ejusdem
generis
to
this
particular
situation
would
only
be
not
justified,
it
would
only
be
incorrect
if
in
fact
there
was
a
manifest
congressional
intent
to
the
contrary.
and
it's
clear
that
there
is
no
such
intent,
and
the
government
has
the
burden,
i
submit,
of
showing
where
it
is
that
congress
intended
that
their
scope
behind
the
statute
would
control.
really,
in
conclusion,
i
would
state
that
the
government
has
basically
lucked
out
in
the
eleventh
circuit.
the
court
apparently,
and
the
government,
was
willing
to...
to
look
and...
and...
and
construe
a
comma
which
would
give
some
credence
to
their
plain
reading,
their
plain
and
unambiguous
version
of
what
it
was
that
they
thought
the
statute
meant.
petitioners
have
contended
from
the
beginning
that
this
is
an...
this
was
an
ambiguous
statute,
and
that
for
the
government
to
construe
it
as
suddenly
that
the...
that
the
congress
intended
to
extend
these
protections
to
all
lawful
custodians
of
any
money--
mr.
charles
g.
white
--well,
essentially
it
doesn't
necessarily
go
into...
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
there
is
no
comma
there,
and
they
wanted
it
there.
they
wanted
it
there
for
a
reason.
the
reason
they
wanted
it
there
was
because
they
want
to
show
that
that
"or",
the
first
"or",
is
the
true
disjunctive
that
sets
off
the
two
categories
that
they
feel
that
congress
was
addressing.
and
with
the
comma
not
there,
under
the...
the...
all
the
case
law
that
was
cited
by
the
government
and
the
eleventh
circuit
regarding
what
"or"
means
and
what
it
means
to
have
a
disjunctive,
and
how
it
separates
separate
categories
and
estops
separate
categories
of
crime,
instead
of
one
disjunctive
with
two
categories,
you've
got
two
disjunctives
with
three
categories.
and
we
have
to
now
look
at
these
grammatical
points,
as
mentioned
before,
and
see
whether
or
not
there
should
have
been
an
"of"
there
or
there
should
not
have
been
an
"of"
there.
and
this
is
what
establishes
the
ambiguity.
mr.
charles
g.
white
your
honor,
that
may
be
the
case.
i...
i'm
not
aware
of
whether
or
not,
in
fact,
commas
are
important
or
unimportant.
i
don't
have
that...
i
don't
have
that
knowledge.
mr.
charles
g.
white
your
honor,
i
don't
believe
that
the...
that
the
petitioners'
position
is
that
i'm
lean...
i'm
not
leaning
on
the
fact
that
there's
a
comma
or
there
wasn't
a
comma.
the
point
of
the
matter
is
that
i
think
that
the...
that
this
all
goes
towards
what
the
government's...
what
they
contend
is
the
plain
reading
of
the
statute,
is
their
version
of
it.
it's
establishing
the
ambiguity.
it's
understanding
whether
or
not
the
statute
is
ambiguous.
mr.
charles
g.
white
no,
your
honor.
no.
i'm
not
saying
that
at
all.
i
don't
think
that
the...
the
case...
i
don't
think
the
case
turns
on
that
comma.
what
i
believe
is
that
the...
the
attitude...
the
interpretation
of
the
statute
turns
on
the
fact...
the
evidence
of
that
comma,
which
it
appears
shows
what
the
government
thinks
and
proves
that
what
they
think
is
only
their
version,
and
it's
not
clear
and
unambiguous
as
they
would
have
you...
as
they
would
have
you
believe.
and
i
think
the
congressional
intent
is
clear
that
the
context
of
the
1935
amendments,
that
it
was
in
fact
designed
to
protect
the
postal
function,
and
that
this
court
should
vacate
the
conviction
and
count
3
of
this
indictment
as
to
both
petitioners
and...
and
remand
to
the
district
court
for...
for
appropriate
orders.
and
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
charles
g.
white
just
to
set
the
comma
business
to
rest,
the
statute,
as
you
can
look
at
it
in
its
entirety,
contains
several
references
to
mail
matter,
to
money,
and
to
other
property
of
the
united
states.
the
first
reference,
which
is
really
where
the
focus
of
the
congressional
intent
has
to...
to
do
with,
the
very
first
reference
it
says...
it
says
"mail
matter
or
any
money
or
other
property
of
the
united
states.
"
and
there
is
no
comma
there.
so
that...
that's
something
i
didn't
realize
that...
that
the
government
was
quoting
from
a
different
section
of
the
statute
than
what
we...
we
thought
we
were
talking
about.
in
any
event,
interestingly,
the
government
said
something
very
interesting.
it
said
that
it
would...
it
was
for
congress
to
determine...
and
this,
i
believe,
was
in
answer
to
justice
o'connor's
question
regarding
the...
between
whether
this
was
unduly
harsh,
the
robbery
of
someone,
say,
from
gsa
of
a
government
hammer
or
something
of
this
nature.
yes,
it's
true
it
was
unduly
harsh,
and
in
fact,
congress
did,
the
legislative--
mr.
charles
g.
white
--certainly.
certainly,
your
honor.
however,
the
statement
that
congressman
dobbins
made
on
the
floor
was
directed
exactly
to
this
provision
of
this
bill
which
makes
it
a
very
unique
bill,
which
is
a
25-year
mandatory
sentence
if
there's
a
dangerous
weapon
used
or
if
it's
a
second
conviction.
now,
he
was
asked,
this
is
not
something
which
we
normally
do.
we
usually
have
a
range,
so
the
sentencing
judge
has
discretion
to
impose
the
sentence
that
he
feels
is
necessary.
and
congressman
dobbins
started
off
his
colloquy
saying
well,
this
is
the
same...
this
is
existing
law.
this
is
the
law
as
it...
as
it
already
stands.
it
already
has
this
25-year
mandatory
sentence.
we're
not
changing
it.
we're
just
expanding
it
a
little
bit.
and
this,
i
think,
is
the
basis...
it
was...
this
issue
that...
that
justice
o'connor
raised
was
actually
raised
before
the
congress
in
these
little
snippets
of--
mr.
charles
g.
white
--especially
the
ones
with
the
department
of
defense.
mr.
charles
g.
white
it
certainly...
it
also
certainly
was
not
the
intent
of
congress
to...
to
give
such
unbridled
discretion
to
the
prosecution.
thank
you
very
much.
