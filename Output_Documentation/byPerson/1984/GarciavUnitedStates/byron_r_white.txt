justice
white
well,
the
solicitor
general
used
to
agree
with
you,
didn't
he?
justice
white
seventh,
seventh.
is
it
the
seventh?
justice
white
was
that
based...
was
that
concession
based
on
the
kind
of
an
argument
you're
making
or
not,
or
was
it
mostly
legislative
history?
justice
white
well,
when
we...
when
we
remanded
that
case
to
the
seventh
circuit,
we
ourselves
didn't
accept
the
confession
of
error.
we
didn't,
in
effect,
construe
the
statute.
didn't
we
just
remand
for
reconsideration
in
light
of
the
solicitor
general's
concession?
justice
white
but
we
didn't...
we
didn't
agree...
we
didn't
necessarily
agree
with
the
solicitor
general.
justice
white
yes,
all
right.
justice
white
but
the
seventh
circuit
did
apparently.
justice
white
yes.
justice
white
--well,
you
don't
suggest
there
aren't
cases
here
that
rely
on
the
legislative
history
to
narrow
the
language
of
the
statute;
that
is,
to
exclude
from
its
coverage
some
conduct
that
on
its
face
is
covered
by
the
statute?
justice
white
well,
you
wouldn't...
would
you
deny
that
there
are
any
cases
in
this
court
that
narrows
the
otherwise
broad
coverage
of
the
words
of
the
statute
based
on
the
legislative
history?
justice
white
well,
a...
i'm
talking
about
words
of
a
statute
that
on
their
face
cover
the
conduct
at
issue,
but
it's
been...
but
it's
held
that
the
statute
doesn't
cover
it
because
of
the
legislative
history.
justice
white
mr.
ganzfried,
if...
if
jose
garcia
had
been
prosecuted
under
2112
instead
on
the
facts
as
the
jury
found
them
in
this
case,
could
the
trial
court
still
have
imposed
a
25-year
sentence
by
just
giving
consecutive
sentences
under
2112
and
111?
justice
white
mr.
ganzfried,
in
u.s.
against
sherman...
that
was
a
fourth
circuit
case...
that
was
an
appeal
by
the
united
states,
i
gather.
and
doesn't
the
solicitor
general
authorize
appeals
of
the
united
states?
justice
white
well,
but
the
citation
is
united
states
against
sherman.
justice
white
yes.
i
see.
so
sherman
did
the
appealing.
justice
white
no.
cert...
cert
denied.
that's
the
title.
justice
white
and
what's...
why...
why
is
the...
why
is
it
captioned
u.s.
against
sherman
in
the
court
of
appeals?
justice
white
what
was...
what
was
the
basis
of
your
concession
in
hanahan?
justice
white
what
you
were...
what
you
filed
here,
which
we
don't
have
in
our
files.
justice
white
so
it
was
legislative
history.
justice
white
well,
that's
all
right.
i
think
you've--
justice
white
--which
you
now
call
a
snippet
or
something.
justice
white
the
passage
of
years
hasn't
charged
it.
justice
white
does
the...
does...
does
the
committee
report
or
the
legislative
history
of
that
1935
statute
or
the
amendment,
was
it...
it
was
revised
in
'35,
was
it?
justice
white
does
the
legislative
history
include
any
comment
by
the
department
of
justice--
justice
white
--on
the
post
office's
proposal?
justice
white
well,
despite
the
clearness
of
the
language,
the
solicitor
general
urged
us
to
look
at
the
legislative
history
in
the
hanahan
case.
justice
white
and
the
seventh...
and
he
urged
the
seventh
circuit
to
do
so,
and
won.
justice
white
well--
justice
white
--the
seventh
circuit
took
the
solicitor
general's
view,
i
think.
justice
white
well,
a
different
view
also
apparently
on
the...
on
the
permissibility
of
looking
at
legislative
history.
justice
white
well,
the
view
must
have
changed
since
hanahan.
justice
white
about
that
issue,
too.
justice
white
yes.
well,
the
legislative
history
back
in
'35
was
not
extensive,
and
i
guess
that's
why
you
call
it
a
snippet;
but
the
prime
sponsor
and
advocate
at
the
hearing
was
this
mr.
dobbins,
and
his
language
and
intent
emerges
pretty
clearly,
mr.
ganzfried.
that's
what
bothers
me.
he
said,
"the
only
purpose
of
the
pending
bill
is
to
extend
the
protection
of
the
present
law
to
property
of
the
united
states
in
the
custody
of
its
postal
officials,
the
same
as
it
now
extends
that
protection
to
mail
matter
in
the
custody
of
the
public
officials...
postal
officials.
"
and
it
just
seemed
to
me,
frankly,
that
was
a
pretty
good
indication
of
what
they
had
in
mind.
and
then
there
were
objections
to
the
language
by
a
mr.
walcott
who
said,
and
i
quote,
"this
is
the
worst
drafted
bill
i've
ever
read.
"
said
he,
and
offered
suggestions
for
clarifying
the
language,
but
they
weren't
adopted.
