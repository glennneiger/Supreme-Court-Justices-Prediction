well,
sure,
but
this
was
in
the
post
office
section
of
the
code,
and
it
was
suggested
by
the
postmaster.
and
the
evidence
all
shows
that
what
they
were
worried
about
were
these
little
substations
where
often
there
was
property
other
than
letters
in
the
custody
of
the
substations
like
a
little
bit
of
money,
and
people
were
coming
in
taking
money
from
these
little
substations.
and
that's
really
why
it
was
passed.
