justice
thurgood
marshall
we
granted
certiorari
in
this
case
and
to
decide
whether
the
constitution
requires
a
state
to
provide
an
indigent
defendant
with
the
assistance
of
a
psychiatrist.
in
this
case
a
defendant
ask
the
oklahoma
trial
court
to
appoint
a
psychiatrist
to
assist
him
in
preparing
his
insanity
defense.
the
court
refused
and
oklahoma
court
of
criminal
appeals
affirmed
and
it
held
that
the
neither
the
state
law
nor
the
constitution
creates
a
right
to
a
state
funded
psychiatrist
examination.
in
an
opinion
on
file
today
with
the
clerk
we
reverse.
we
hold
that
when
a
defendant
demonstrates
to
the
trial
judge
that
insanity
at
the
time
of
the
defense
is
likely
to
be
a
significant
factor
at
trial
that
a
state
must
at
a
minimum
assure
that
the
defendant
access
to
incompetence
psychiatrist
who
will
conduct
an
appropriate
examination
and
insists
in
eveluating
preparation
and
presentation
of
the
defense.
in
addition,
when
in
the
sentencing
phase
of
a
capital
case
the
prosecutor
places
before
the
jury
psychiatric
evidence
of
the
defendants
future
dangerousness,
the
defendant
is
entitled
to
the
examination
and
assistance
of
a
psychiatrists.
in
this
case
the
defendant
maybe
necessary
joined
and
was
therefore
entitled
to
the
assistance
of
a
psychiatrist.
we
reverse
the
decision
of
the
oklahoma
court.
the
chief
justice
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
the
judgment;
justice
rehnquist
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion.
