justice
white
the
union
represented
the
employee
before
the
arbitrator?
justice
white
so
it
had
an
opportunity
at
that
time
to
ask...
or
did
it
have
an
opportunity
to
ask
for
a
remedy
tailored
to
its
own
interests?
justice
white
or
would
it
have
had
to
file
a
separate
grievance
of
its
own?
justice
white
well,
if
that
is
clear
enough,
then
it
was
clearly
out
of
bounds
to
give
a
remedy
to
the
union
in
this
case.
justice
white
is
there
something
clear
about
that
in
the
act,
or
is
there
any...
it
is
just
clear
because
the
union
is
free
to
file
a
grievance
of
its
own?
is
that
it?
justice
white
you
just
say
that
is
plain
wrong.
justice
white
and
this
remedy
was
imposed
plainly
to
benefit
the
union,
not
the
employee.
justice
white
how
about
this
case?
justice
white
could
the
union
have
filed
its
own
grievance?
justice
white
and
gotten
an
appropriate
remedy
for
its
omission
from
the
initial
steps?
justice
white
i
just
asked...
how
about
the
answer
to
my
question?
it
might
have
had
that
kind
of
a
remedy?
justice
white
and
the
employer
could
have
been
told,
don't
do
it
any
more?
justice
white
by
the
arbitrator?
justice
white
well,
suppose
an
employee
is
discharged
for
what...
if
he
did
what
he
did,
anybody
would
say
he
shouldn't
be
working
for
this
agency,
and
it
goes
to
arbitration,
and
the
arbitrator
says,
yes,
you
certainly
shouldn't
be
working
for
this
agency
but
you
didn't
have
the
benefit
of
your
union
at
the
initial
sit-down,
so
we
are
going
to
put
you
back
on
the
payroll.
is
that
your
argument?
justice
white
but
this
remedy
was
imposed
expressly
just
to
vindicate
the
union's
rights.
justice
white
nothing
to
do
with
whether
these
people
did
or
didn't
do
what
they
were
charged
with
doing,
or
what
their
desserts
were.
justice
white
would
they
have
contested
the
remedy,
i
suppose,
would
they,
except
for
their
exclusion
from
the
sit-down
process?
justice
white
well,
what
was
their
position
before
the
arbitrator?
just
the
remedy?
justice
white
the
union's.
justice
white
do
you
think
under
the
law
the
board
could
have
imposed
this
very
remedy
if
the
employee
in
appearing
before
the
board
had
said,
i
am
entitled
to
relief
here
because
i
didn't
have
my
representative
earlier
in
this
procedure,
and
the
entire
factfinding
process
was
tainted?
do
you
think
the
board
could
have
said,
well,
we
don't
agree
with
you
at
all,
but
you
were
entitled
to
the
presence
of
the
union,
so
we
are
going
to
reinstate
you.
do
you
think
the
board
had
that
authority?
justice
white
but
i
take
it
both
are
supposed
to
follow
the
applicable
statutes,
not
ignore
the
applicable
statutes.
justice
white
the
government
says
the
arbitrator
did
that
in
this
case.
justice
white
well,
it
is
also
relying
on
its
own.
justice
white
yes.
justice
white
what
steps
can
the
union
take
to
ensure
that
this
won't
happen
again
other
than
filing
some
procedure,
proceeding?
how
does
it
ever
get
into
the
initial
stages?
who
tells
them
about
what?
justice
white
by
whom?
justice
white
the
employer.
justice
white
and
of
course
any
employee
can
notify
the
union,
can't
it?
justice
white
who
can
file
a
grievance?
justice
white
and
the
employee
files
a
grievance
and
doesn't
even
tell
the
union.
is
that
what
happened
in
this
case?
justice
white
what
happened?
justice
white
and
then
what
happened?
justice
white
and
during
the
processing
was
the
employee
there?
justice
white
what
wrong
was
committed
against
the
union
here?
justice
white
did
it
file
the
grievance?
justice
white
did
the
employee
file
the
grievance?
justice
white
in
this
case.
justice
white
this
particular
case.
and
never
notified
the
union?
justice
white
i
see.
well,
now,
i
don't...
suppose
he
has
union
help
through
the
early
stages
of
the
grievance
procedure,
and
then
the
question
is...
from
there
on
it
is
either
to
the
board
or
to
arbitration.
do
you
mean,
if
he
has
had
union
help
in
the
initial
phases,
he
has
got
to
go
to
arbitration
as
a
further
remedy
if
the
union
will
let
him?
is
that
it?
he
cannot
go
to
the
board
at
all.
justice
white
i
would
think
there
would
be
a
lot
of
employees
that
wouldn't
want
the
union.
justice
white
well,
they
can't
if
they
have
had
a
union.
