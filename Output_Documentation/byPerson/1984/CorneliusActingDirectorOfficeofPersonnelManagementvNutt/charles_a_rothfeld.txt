mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
this
case
concerns
the
federal
government's
ability
to
fire
or
discipline
employees
who
have
engaged
in
serious
misconduct.
under
the
civil
service
reform
act
of
1978,
an
employee
who
is
fired
or
subjected
to
another
form
of
so-called
adverse
agency
action
may
challenge
that
action
in
one
of
two
ways.
any
employee
may
seek
to
have
the
action
set
aside
by
filing
an
appeal
with
the
merit
system
protection
board.
alternatively,
an
employee
who
belongs
to
a
bargaining
unit
may
invoke
the
grievance
procedures
set
out
in
the
contract
between
his
union
and
the
agency
that
employs
him.
no
matter
which
of
the
routes
the
employees
follow,
the
statute
sets
out
the
standards
of
proof
and
substantive
rules
that
must
control
the
decision
in
the
case.
one
of
these
statutory
standards
is
the
harmful
error
rule,
which
provides
that
an
employee
may
have
otherwise
justified
adverse
action
against
him
overturned
if
he
is
able
to
demonstrate
harmful
error
in
the
agency's
application
of
its
procedures
in
arriving
at
its
decision.
reversal
also
is
in
order
if
the
employee
may
demonstrate
that
the
agency
committed
harmful
error
in
the
application
of
a
procedural
rule
set
out
in
the
collective
bargaining
agreement.
the
issue
here
is
the
application
of
this
harmful
error
rule
to
two
federal
employees
who
undoubtedly
engaged
in
serious
misconduct.
the
two
were
employed
by
the
general
services
administration
as
officers
in
the
federal
protective
service
when
their
employer
received
information
that
they
had
falsified
law
enforcement
records
to
cover
up
misbehavior
and
had
misused
government
property.
after
conducting
an
investigation,
gsa
concluded
that
the
charges
had
been
proved,
and
it
ordered
the
two
employees
separated
from
federal
service.
the
employees,
who
were
members
of
a
bargaining
unit,
elected
to
challenge
this
action
by
filing
a
grievance
through
the
negotiated
procedure.
the
case
went
to
arbitration.
the
arbitrator
found
that--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--yes,
they
are
required
to
provide
for
arbitration.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
they
may
differ,
your
honor.
in
this
case,
the
arbitrator
found
that
the
employees
had
committed
the
acts
alleged,
and
that
those
acts
fully
justified
the
separation
of
the
employees
from
federal
service.
the
arbitrator
also
found
that
gsa
had
misinterpreted
its
contract
with
the
employees'
union,
and
that
misinterpretation
led
it
to
commit
two
procedural
errors
during
the
investigation
into
the
employees'
misconduct.
the
employees
had
not
been
informed
that
they
had
a
right
to
request
the
presence
of
a
union
representative
when
they
were
interviewed
by
investigating
agents.
and
the
agency
had
delayed
unnecessarily
before
informing
the
employees
that
they
would
be
fired.
but
the
arbitrator
concluded
that
these
procedural
mistakes
in
no
way
prejudiced
the
grievance
case,
did
not
affect
the
course
of
the
agency's
investigation,
and
had
no
impact
on
the
agency's
decision
to
fire
the
two
employees.
despite
these
findings,
however,
the
arbitrator,
in
order
to
penalize
the
agency,
ordered
it
to
reinstate
the
two
employees
in
the
federal
protective
service
after
they
had
served
a
two-week
suspension.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
federal
circuit
upheld
this
decision.
the
court
accepted
the
arbitrator's
findings
that
the
grievants
had
committed
the
acts
alleged
and
that
those
acts
fully
warranted
their
being
removed
from
federal
employment.
the
court
also
accepted
the
arbitrator's
finding
that
the
procedural
mistakes
had
no
effect
on
the
outcome
of
the
case,
and
the
court
acknowledged
that
the
statutory
harmful
error
rule
controls
arbitral
decisions.
but
the
court
went
on
to
conclude
that
a
union
may
assert
its
own
institutional
interests
during
the
course
of
an
individual
employee's
adverse
action
challenge,
if
that
challenge
is
brought
through
a
negotiated
grievance
procedure.
as
a
result,
the
court
found
that
an
arbitrator
must
set
aside
otherwise
justified
adverse
action
taken
against
an
employee
on
account
of
non-prejudicial
that
that
error
was
in
some
undefined
sense
harmful
to
the
employee's
union.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
it
is
not
clear
whether
they
could,
your
honor.
since
the
arbitrator
and
the
court
of
appeals
imposed
or
took
away
the
sanctions
that
had
been
imposed
by
the
agency
to
penalize
the
agency,
it
might
well
be
that
the
court
would
then
find
that
the
agency
would
be
circumventing
its
order
if
it
attempted
to
get
around
the
penalty
by
reinstituting
proceedings.
so,
it
is
not
clear
whether--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--that
is
true,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
i
think
that
is
true.
the
focus--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--the
arbitrator
focused
solely
on
the
procedural
mistakes
that
were
made
by
the
agency,
and
in
fact
the
actions
of
the
employees
in
this
case
were
serious
violations
which
the
arbitrator
noted
could
be
subjected
to
criminal
penalties.
the
case
had
been
referred
to
the
united
states
attorney,
and
he
delayed
taking
action
because
he
believed
that
it
could
be
settled
through
the
agency
process.
so,
even
violations
of
law
obviously
are
affected
by
the
arbitrator's
decision
and
the
court
of
appeals'
affirmance
in
this
case.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
well,
there
are
two
points
to
make
in
response
to
that,
justice
o'connor.
first,
most
procedural
violations
will
be
addressed
during
the
course
of
an
adverse
action
challenge
anyway,
because
any
consequential
violation
of
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
which
had
an
effect
or
might
have
affected
the
agency's
decision
will
be
taken
into
account
and
may
lead
to
the
overturning
of
adverse
action.
in
those
cases
in
which
procedural
errors
had
no
effect
on
the
agency's
decision,
the
act
gives
unions
their
own
distinct
remedial
procedures
that
they
can
use.
any
union
can
file
a
grievance
of
its
own
challenging
any
violation
of
the
collective
bargaining
agreement,
and
if
it
prevails,
it
might
ask
the
arbitrator
to
issue
a
cease
and
desist
order
to
the
offending
agency.
in
clear
cases
of
contractual
violations,
the
union
could
also
file
an
unfair
labor
practice
charge
with
the
federal
labor
relations
authority.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
well,
certainly
the
federal
labor
relations
authority.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
well,
the
arbitrator
certainly
can
remedy
in
any
way
they
find
appropriate
a
violation
of--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--i
believe
that
would
be
an
appropriate
remedy,
if
the
arbitrator
found
that
a
violation
had
occurred,
and
that
that
was
a
way
to
redress
the
violation.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
private
arbitrators
generally
direct
the
remedy
to
whatever
violations
have
been
found,
and
i
think
that...
if
this
is
an
instance
where
the
union
is
asserting
its
institutional
interests,
and
as
the
statute
clearly
allows
it
to
do
for
any
violation
of
the
collective
bargaining
agreement.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
well,
past
misconduct
or
past
procedural
violations
that
had
no
effect
on
the
outcome
of
the
agency's
decision,
one
thing
the
arbitrator
certainly
cannot
do
is
reinstate
penalized
employees.
the
harmful
error
rule
forecloses
the
arbitrator
from
taking
that
action.
so,
to
that
sense,
procedural
violations
won't
be
addressed
by
the
arbitrator
except
to
the
extent
he
will
prevent
the
agency
from
committing...
or
direct
the
agency
not
to
commit
further
violations
in
the
future.
i
think,
your
honor,
the
interpretation
of
the
harmful
error
rule
that
is
provided
by
the
court
of
appeals
can
only
benefit
one
narrow
class
of
federal
employee
under
any
reading
of
the
rule.
an
employee
whose
adverse
action
was
affected
by
procedural
error
will
have
that
action
overturned.
and
under
any
reading
of
the
rule
an
employee
who
brought
his
adverse
action
to
the
merit
systems
protection
board
will
have
that
action
overturned
only
if
he
can
demonstrate
that
the
procedural
mistake
had
some
effect
on
the
outcome
of
his
case.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
it
made
provision
for
arbitration.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
well,
congress
recognized
that
there
are
a
variety
of
advantages
to
arbitration,
and
certainly
we
don't
dispute
that.
arbitration
is
faster
and
is
often
less
expensive
than
litigation,
and
may
well
be
less
acrimonious.
but
congress
did
not
make
arbitration
preferred
in
the
sense
that
it
intended
there
would
be
outcome
determinative
differences
between
arbitration
and
appeals
through
the
merit
systems
protection
board.
it
was
quite
explicit
on
that,
providing
that
they
were
to
be
governed
by
the
same
standards
and
that...
in
fact,
the
legislative
history
said
they
should
be
applied
identically.
so,
i
don't
think
arbitration
was
the
preferred
method
in
the
sense
that
it
intended
every
employee
with
a
claim
of
procedural
error
to
go
to
arbitration
because
he
knew
that
he
would
win
in
arbitration
and
might
not
win
before
the
merit
systems
protection
board.
but
that
in
fact
is
the
only...
the
only
category
of
employees
who
are
benefitted
by
the
court
of
appeals'
ruling
are
those
who
have
been
demonstrated
to
be
unfit
for
federal
service
who
are
challenging
a
procedural
error
that
concededly
did
not
effect
the
outcome
of
their
case,
and
who
chose
to
go
through
the
negotiated
grievance
procedure.
and
this
result,
for
a
variety
of
reasons,
is
clearly
not
what
congress
intended
when
it
enacted
the
civil
service
reform
act.
i
think
the
problem
with
the
court
of
appeals
decision
is
plain
on
the
face
of
the
statute.
in
so
many
words,
the
act
places
on
the
affected
employee
the
burden
of
demonstrating
that
harmful
procedural
error
was
committed
while
the
agency
was
arriving
at
its
decision.
given
any
straightforward
reading,
this
appears
to
place
on
the
employee
the
burden
of
demonstrating
that
the
agency's
result
in
the
case
might
have
been
affected
by
the
error,
and
that
is
the
definition
of
the
term
given
by
the
merit
systems
protection
board,
which
is
the
agency
that
is
given
responsibility
for
interpreting
the
act's
standard
of
proof
provisions,
and
it
is
the
only
interpretation
that
gives
effect
to
the
full
congressional
purpose.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
well,
the
nature
of
the
proceeding--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--i
think,
your
honor,
that
if
it
had
wanted
to
assert
its
institutional
interests,
it
would
have
been
required
to
file
a
separate
union
grievance,
which
the
arbitrator
might
have
consolidated.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
i
think
that
is
correct,
justice
white.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
well,
the
nature
of
the
statutory
adverse
action
proceeding,
i
think,
does
make
that
clear.
in
addition
to
the
remedies
that
are
given
the
union--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--the
union
may
independently
invoke...
file
a
grievance
of
its
own
and
invoke
arbitration
on
its
own
behalf.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
yes,
that's
correct.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
through
the
merit
systems
protection
board.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
no,
it
may
not.
in
either--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--correct.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
that's
correct,
your
honor.
the
employee
is
also
given
two
routes.
he
can
go
to
the
merit
systems--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--well,
the
federal
circuit
we
think
incorrectly
held
that
the
union
is
a
participant
or
is
an
independent
party
to
the
employee's
adverse
action
charge
through
arbitration,
and
in
fact,
the
answer
to
your
question
is
no.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
we
do
say
that
is
plain
wrong,
not
only
because
the
union
has
its
own
independent
remedies,
but
because
the
adverse
action
procedures
place
the
focus
on
the
employee.
it
is
the
employee,
not
the
union,
which
decides
the
forum
for
the
challenge.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
explicitly,
your
honor.
the
court
of
appeals
opinion
explicitly
provided
that
it
is
the
union
which
is
being
benefitted.
in
response
to
you,
justice
brennan,
it
is
the
employee
and
not
the
union
which
chooses
the
forum,
either
the
merit
systems--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--that's
correct.
in
an
adverse
action--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--that's
right,
justice
brennan.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
no,
if
the
employee
opts
not
to
go
through
the
grievance
procedure,
the
union
has
no
recourse.
and
if
the
employee...
if
the
case
goes
to
arbitration
and
the
arbitrator
issues
a
decision
adverse
to
the
employee's
interest,
it
is
only
the
employee
who
can
then
appeal
to
the
federal
circuit.
the
union
has
no
independent
right
to
appeal
on
the
employee's
behalf.
so,
the
entire
procedural
structure
of
the
adverse
action
proceeding
is
focused
on
the
rights
of
the
employee,
not
on
the
rights
of
the
union.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
members
of
bargaining
units,
whether
or
not
they
are
dues-paying
union
members,
may
invoke
the
negotiating
procedure.
when
congress
placed
the
harmful
error
rule
in
the
statute
to
address
these
problems,
it
did
so
expressly
to
provide
that
a
federal
employee
adverse
action
would
not
be
overturned
simply
because
of
technical
or
procedural
mistakes
on
the
part
of
their
employers.
and
it
did
this
with
the
express
purpose
of
overcoming
the
widely
held
view
that
federal
employees
cannot
be
fired
no
matter
how
egregious
or
unacceptable
their
conduct,
and
it
cannot
be
consistent
with
this
intent
to
keep
employees
on
the
federal
payroll
after
they
have
been
demonstrated
unfit
simply
because
their
employer
committed
a
concededly
non-prejudicial
procedural
mistake
while
attempting
to
fire
them,
but
that
is
the
effect
of
the
court
of
appeals'
ruling.
that
is
its
primary
effect.
here,
for
example,
the
court
reinstated
in
the
federal
protective
service
two
employees
after
the
arbitrator,
in
his
own
words,
found
that
their
actions
had
rendered
them
unworthy
of
their
employer's
trust.
and
the
decision
will
lead
to
other
results
that
congress
wished
to
avoid
as
well.
while
the
civil
service
reform
act
gives
unions
broad
leeway
to
negotiate
the
procedural
rights,
it
also
insists
that
arbitrators
and
the
merit
systems
protection
board
apply
identical
standards
in
judging
adverse
action
challenges.
congress
placed
that
provision
in
the
act
expressly
to
promote
consistency
between
board
and
arbitral
decisions,
and
to
prevent
forum
shopping
on
the
part
of
the
aggrieved
employees
between
those
two
decision-makers.
but
it
seems
undeniable
that
the
court
of
appeals
decision
will
frustrate
both
of
those
purposes.
it
guarantees
that
there
will
be
inconsistent
decisions
because
it
establishes
two
entirely
distinct
harmful
error
rules,
one
to
be
applied
by
the
board,
one
to
be
applied
by
arbitrators.
had
one
of
the
employees
in
this
case
gone
to
the
board,
for
example,
he
would
have
lost,
while
his
identically
situated
co-worker
was
being
returned
to
his
job
at
the
federal
protective
service
by
the
arbitrator's
decision.
and
this
state
of
affairs
in
turn
guarantees
that
forum
shopping
will
occur.
the
act
gives
the
aggrieved
employee
the
right
to
choose
between
which
two
forums
he
will
bring
his
challenge.
if
employees
realize
that
arbitrators
are
applying
their
own
outcome-determinative,
more
generous
standards
in
cases
involving
procedural
error,
every
sensible
bargaining
unit
employee
who
has
a
procedural
claim
will
choose
to
go
through
the
negotiated
grievance
route.
the
result
will
be
consistently
more
favorable
treatment
for
the
60
percent
of
federal
employees
who
are
bargaining
unit
members
than
for
the
40
percent
who
are
not.
not
only
is
this
result
inequitable,
but
it
distorts
the
procedural
scheme
that
congress
envisioned.
the
act
establishes
a
single
uniform
system
for
disposing
of
adverse
action
challenges
which
gives
the
bargaining
unit
employee
the
right
to
choose
between
two...
what
are
supposed
to
be
two
roughly
equivalent
fora
for
bringing
their
appeals.
while
congress
certainly
recognized
that
a
variety
of
factors
would
impel
employees
to
choose
one
route
rather
than
the
other
for
their
challenges,
the
act's
emphasis
on
consistency
makes
it
plain
that
one
of
those
factors
should
not
be
the
existence
of
substantive
rules
that
make
one
forum
predictably
more
likely
to
grant
relief
than
the
other.
the
court
of
appeals
sidestepped
all
of
these
considerations
by
asserting
that
the
union's
role
as
the
representative
of
the
employee
in
an
adverse
action
challenge
means
that
it
can
assert
its
own
institutional
interests
during
the
course
of
the
employee's
adverse
action
appeal.
but
this
reasoning
is
squarely
inconsistent
with
the
language
and
purposes
of
the
harmful
error
rule
and
with
the
act's
emphasis
on
consistency
between
board
and
arbitral
judgments.
as
noted
before,
the
emphasis
of
the
adverse
action
procedures
is
squarely
on
the
protected
employee.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
he
may
be
represented
by
his
union,
but
the
union
is
not
his
exclusive
representative
as
it
is
in
the
arbitration.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
the
union
has
no
statutory
role
in
that--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--the
union
may
elect
to
provide
representation,
but
it
has
no
statutory
role,
and
it
has
no
official
role
in
the
proceedings.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
in
this
case...
in
every
case
in
which
arbitration
is
invoked,
the
union
represents
the
employee.
so
the
union
did
provide
representation
in
this
case.
a
final
point.
the
court
of
appeals
apparently
believed
that
the
collective
bargaining
process
would
be
made
meaningless
if
employees
were
not
permitted
to
have
adverse
action
overturned
on
account
of
non-prejudicial
procedural
violations.
now,
it
is
obvious
that
this
concern
was
vastly
overstated.
under
any
interpretation
of
the
harmful
error
rule,
unions
will
be
free
to
negotiate
for
whatever
procedures
they
wish.
under
any
interpretation
of
the
rule,
agencies
are
obligated
to
abide
by
those
procedures.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
no,
it
does
not,
your
honor.
by
contract,
the
nature
of
the
issues
that
can
go
to
arbitration
may
be
determined
by
the
union
and
the
agency.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
that's
correct.
any
adverse
action
affected
by
a
violation
of
rights
contained
in
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
will
be
overturned
either
by
the
board
or
by
an
arbitrator.
as
a
result,
it
is
only
the
least
meaningful
of
procedural
violations,
those
found
by
an
arbitrator
or
the
board
to
have
had
no
effect
on
the
outcome
of
the
case,
that
will
not
be
taken
into
account
during
an
employee's
adverse
action
challenge.
and
the
union
may
obtain
a
remedy
even
for
these
types
of
procedural
mistakes
by
filing
its
own
grievance
or
an
unfair
labor
practice
charge
if
appropriate.
in
drafting
the
act,
congress
explicitly
balanced
all
of
these
concerns
and
protected
the
interests
of
unions
by
giving
them
their
own
set
of
remedies,
and
by
providing
that
agency
decisions
affected
by
violations
of
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
cannot
stand.
it
protected
the
rights
of
employees
by
giving
them
a
variety
of
procedural
options
to
challenge
adverse
action,
and
by
providing
that
action
taken
against
them
in
violation
either
of
regulations
or
of
the
terms
of
the
collective
bargaining
agreement,
so
long
as
the
action
was
affected
by
the
violation,
will
be
overturned.
and
it
explicitly
protected
the
public's
interest
in
a
competent
and
efficient
government
by
providing
that
inconsequential
agency
errors
will
not
force
the
retention
on
the
federal
payroll
of
demonstrably
unfit
federal
employees
simply
because
the
agency
committed
a
procedural
mistake
while
attempting
to
remove
those
employees
from
federal
service.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
your
honor,
i
will
reserve.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
a
few
quick
points,
your
honor.
first,
while
it
is
true
the
merit
system
protection
board
may
mitigate
an
employee's
penalty,
it
does
so
based
on
an
analysis
of
the
employee's
situation
to
make
the
remedy
fit
the
offense.
it
does
not
in
any
event
consider
the
harmless
procedural
error
in
deciding
whether
mitigation
is
appropriate.
there
is
no
reason
to
believe
that
the
board
would
ever
take
a
union's
institutional
rights
into
account,
because
the
board's
own
regulation
defines
harmful
error
as
error
that
affects
or
might
have
affected
the
outcome
of
the
case.
it
follows
from
that
we
are
not
arguing
that
the
arbitrator
here
abused
his
discretion,
or
that
the
arbitrator
was
wrong
because
he
departed
from
the
board's
interpretation
of
the
harmful
error
rule.
the
arbitrator
was
incorrect
because
he
departed
from
the
statutory
standard
that
congress
laid
down
to
control
in
a
parallel
way
both
the
decisions
of
the
board
and
the
decisions
of
arbitrators.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
i
think
that
is
true,
your
honor.
the
statute
gives
the
employee
the
option
of
filing
either
a
grievance
through
the
negotiated
procedure
or
with
the
merit
systems
protection
board.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
at
the
initial
step,
but
of
course
the
union
is
obligated
by
its
duty
of
fair
representation
to
safeguard
the
employee's
rights--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--that
is
true,
your
honor,
and
an
employee
who
doesn't
wish
representation
by
a
union
may
go
through
the
merit
systems
protection
board
and
obtain
the...
or
should
be
able
to--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--if
he
elects
to
follow
the
negotiated
procedure,
that
is
his
choice,
and
once
he
has
done
that,
that
is
it.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
i
believe
that
is
correct,
justice
white.
the
statute
gives
him
an
option
of
electing
to
go
one
way
or
the
other.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
i
think
that
is
true,
your
honor.
at
least
the
figures
available
from
the
gsa
indicate
that
many
employees
elect
to
go
through
the
board
and
not
through
the
negotiated
grievance
procedure.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
they
can
go
to
the
board
if
they
have
not
yet
elected
to
use
the
grievance
procedure.
there
is
no
obligation
that
they
do
so.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
that
is
right,
justice
rehnquist.
congress
explicitly
gave
employees
a
choice,
one
or
the
other.
and
to
answer
one
of
your
questions,
chief
justice
burger,
there
is
no
indication
in
the
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals
or
the
arbitrator
that
the
type
of
crime
or
violation
committed
by
the
employees
should
make
any
difference
in
the
remedy
that
is
provided,
because
it
is
not
the
employee's
situation
which
is
being
considered
by
the
arbitrator.
it
is
the
violation
of
the
union's
institutional
rights.
and
in
either
case,
no
matter
what
the
employee
did,
that
violation
presumably
is
the
same.
i
think
two
quick
final
points.
there
certainly
is
no
reason
to
believe
that
arbitration
will
be
made
meaningless
in
any
sense
if
inconsequential
procedural
errors
cannot
lead
to
the
overturning
of
adverse
agency
action.
any
important
violation
would
be
remedied
in
precisely
the
same
way
that
it
would
be
remedied
before
the
board.
in
fact,
coming
to
any
other
conclusion
would
be
entirely
inconsistent
with
the
congressional
emphasis
on
avoiding
forum
shopping.
it
seems
undeniable
that
forum
shopping
will
occur
if
the
arbitrators
are
permitted
to
take
into
account
the
violations
that
the
board,
by
statute
and
by
its
regulations,
cannot
take
into
account.
finally,
one
final
point,
it
is
true
that
there
are
a
variety
of
management
rights
that
are
not
negotiable
with
unions.
one
of
the
things
which
the
federal
circuit
has
also
found
is
not
negotiable
is
the
harmful
error
rule.
a
union
and
an
agency
cannot
agree
to
dispense
with
the
harmful
error
rule
because
congress
believed
it
was
so
important
that
unfit
federal
employees
not
be
retained
on
the
federal
work
force
because
of
inconsequential
procedural
mistakes.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
your
honor.
