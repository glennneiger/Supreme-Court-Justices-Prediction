justice
jr.
excuse
me,
mr.
rothfeld.
do
most
collective
bargaining
agreements
in
the
federal
service
have
a
grievance
procedure
that
concludes
with
arbitration.
justice
jr.
do
they
have
a
standard
form
of
arbitration
clause,
or
may
they
differ
depending
on
how
the
union
and
the
agency
negotiate?
justice
jr.
i
am
sorry,
mr.
rothfeld.
you
say
both
the
arbitrator
as
well
as
the
agency,
the
fd...
whatever
that
labor
agency
is
styled,
each
can
issue
cease
and
desist
orders
when
a
grievance
is
prosecuted
by
the
union?
justice
jr.
it
may,
of
course,
because
it
is
proceeding,
alleging
an
unfair
labor
practice,
but
what
about...
may
the
arbitrator
issue
a
cease
and
desist
order?
justice
jr.
well,
including
a...
i
thought
i
heard
you
say
earlier,
including
a
cease
and
desist
order.
against
the
agency?
justice
jr.
are
cease
and
desist
orders
something
that
private
arbitrators
can
do,
do
you
think?
justice
jr.
well,
now,
what
about
the
past
misconduct,
assuming
the
cease
and
desist
order,
whether
it
is
the
labor
board
or
the
arbitrator?
what
is
done
about
the
past
misconduct
if
it
is
the
arbitrator
who
wishes...
has
the
remedy
of
cease
and
desist?
justice
jr.
now,
as
i
recall
it,
the
congressional
history
here
of
this
statute
weighs
heavily
in
favor...
indicated
congress
weighed
heavily
in
favor
of
arbitration,
did
it
not?
justice
jr.
but
there
is
much
in
the
legislative
history
that
says
that
that
is
the
preferred
course?
justice
jr.
may
the
union
invoke
independently
the
adverse
action
procedure?
justice
jr.
no,
no,
but
that
is
under
the
collective
bargaining
agreement,
isn't
it?
justice
jr.
but
how
about
the
route
that
the
non-union
member
may
take
before
the...
what
do
you
call
it,
the
agency
or
something?
justice
jr.
yes.
may
the
union
independently
go
to
the
merit
systems
protection
board?
justice
jr.
its
only
remedy
is
either
to
go
file
its
own
grievance
under
the
collective
bargaining
agreement,
right,
or
go
to
the
labor
relations
board?
justice
jr.
those
are
the
only
two
routes
you
think
that
the
union
may
take?
justice
jr.
but
that
isn't
what
the
federal
circuit
held,
was
it?
justice
jr.
wasn't
congress
focused
on
the
employee,
not
on
the
union?
justice
jr.
and
it
gave
the
employee
the
options
of
going
the
collective
bargaining
route
or
going
the
merit
board
route,
didn't
it?
justice
jr.
it
didn't
give
the
union
that.
justice
jr.
incidentally,
do
non-union
members,
do
they
have...
may
they
invoke
the
collective
bargaining
grievance
procedure?
justice
jr.
perhaps
you
answered
this
already,
mr.
rothfeld,
but
did
you
say
or
not
that
the
individual
employee
who
elects
to
go
the
merit
board
route
on
appeal
may
or
may
not
have
the
help
of
his
union?
justice
jr.
he
is
not
going
to
collective
bargaining
unit,
now,
he
is
going
to
the
merit
board.
justice
jr.
does
the
union
in
fact
play
any
role
on
behalf
of
the
employee
when
the
employee
elects
to
go
the
merit
board
route?
justice
jr.
well,
may
an
agency
and
the
union
negotiate
a
provision
limiting
the
scope
of
an
arbitrator's
authority,
or
does
the
requirement
that
they
go
to
arbitration
spell
out
what
the
scope
of
the
arbitration
is?
justice
jr.
by
the
collective
bargaining
agreement.
justice
jr.
very
well.
mr.
hobbie.
justice
jr.
the
union
can't
go
before
the
board
with
its
own?
justice
jr.
the
only
places
it
may
go
if
there
is
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
is
to
the
arbitrator.
justice
jr.
or
to
the
labor
board.
justice
jr.
in
grievances
brought
by
employees
in
the
collective
bargaining--
justice
jr.
well,
of
course,
the
same
grievant
can't
be
before
both
the
board
and
the
arbitrator
at
the
same
time,
can
they?
justice
jr.
cannot
be.
justice
jr.
once
he
elects
the
route
he
wants
to
take,
he
is
stuck
with
it,
and
he
can't
go
the
other
route
ever.
justice
jr.
how
do
you
get
these
differences
between
the
board
and
the
arbitrator
on
the
interpretation
of
harmful
error?
didn't
you
say
there
are
differences,
that
the
board
has
interpreted
what
is
such
error--
justice
jr.
--and
that
you
disagree
with
the
interpretation
the
board
has
put
on
it?
justice
jr.
how
did
the
board
in
your
view
improperly
interpret
the
harmful
error
rule?
justice
jr.
well,
then,
i
don't
understand
where
the
conflict--
justice
jr.
--what
is
it
you
disagree
with
that
the
board
has
done
in
the
way
of
interpetation?
justice
jr.
that
you
disagree
with.
justice
jr.
and
was
not
required
to
follow
the
board's
interpretation
because
the
union
was
not
party
to
the
board's
proceeding.
justice
jr.
nor
the
other
way
around,
i
take
it.
justice
jr.
those
were
meetings
with
supervisors
up
the
line?
justice
jr.
and
then
what
happened?
justice
jr.
yes.
justice
jr.
mr.
rothfeld,
i
think
your
colleague
just
said
that
if
the
employee
goes
all
through
the
grievance
procedure
with
the
union,
up
to
the
last
supervisor,
and
that
the
union
does
not
elect
to
go
arbitration,
the
employee
is
finished.
he
can't
go
either
to
the
board
or
to
the
arbitrator.
is
that
right?
justice
jr.
you
mean,
at
the
very
first,
at
the
initial
step.
is
that
it?
justice
jr.
it
may
be
that
the
employee
then
may
never
want
a
union
through
those
initial
steps.
justice
jr.
but
if
he
takes
union
help
through
the
initial
steps,
then
he
is
stuck
with
it.
he
can't
go
to
the
board.
he
has
to
go
the
collective
bargaining
route.
is
that
it?
