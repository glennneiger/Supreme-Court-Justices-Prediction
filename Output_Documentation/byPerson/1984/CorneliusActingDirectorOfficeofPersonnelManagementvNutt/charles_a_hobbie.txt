mr.
charles
a.
hobbie
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
the
question
presented
this
afternoon
may
be
more
simply
stated
than
the
government
has
done.
the
question
is,
does
the
arbitral
award
violate
the
harmful
error
provision
of
the
reform
act.
it
is
not
disputed
that
if
the
award
is
not
inconsistent
with
the
reform
act,
it
should
be
upheld.
we
contend
that
the
court
of
appeals
correctly
decided
that
the
extension
of
the
harmful
error
rule
to
be
applicable
to
important
rights
of
the
rest
of
the
members
of
the
collective
bargaining
unit,
the
collective
rights,
if
you
will,
of
employees
represented
by
the
union,
is
entirely
consistent
with
law.
the
government
claims
specifically
that
only
error
harmful
to
the
rights
of
the
individual
grievant
may
be
considered
in
the
arbitral
context.
this
contention
is
based
on
an
interpretation
of
the
statute
by
the
merit
systems
protection
board.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbie
yes,
your
honor,
the
union--
mr.
charles
a.
hobbie
--that
is
the
critical
question,
your
honor,
what
would
be
an
appropriate
remedy--
mr.
charles
a.
hobbie
--yes,
your
honor,
the
union
could
have
filed--
mr.
charles
a.
hobbie
--yes,
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbie
by
the
arbitrator,
but,
your
honor,
i
would
point
out
in
the
context
of
this
particular
case
early
in
the
arbitral
decision
the
arbitrator
makes
reference
to
a
previous
arbitration
award
by
another
arbitrator
involving
the
same
parties,
gsa
and
this
local.
in
that
situation,
which
happened
the
previous
year,
again,
the
agency
had
not
provided
the
grievant
with
the
opportunity
to
be
represented
by
the
union.
so
the
arbitrator
in
this
case,
knowing
that
this
violation
had
occurred
just
the
previous
year,
would,
i
suggest,
be
reluctant
just
to
issue
a
cease
and
desist
order,
because
he
knows
the
agency
last
year
did
exactly
the
same
thing,
and
was
put
on
notice
by
another
arbitrator
not
to
do
it
again,
and
yet
they
go
ahead
and
do
exactly
the
same
thing.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbie
our
argument
is,
your
honor,
that
the
arbitrator
is
in
the
best
position
to
devise
a
remedy
for
the
situation.
in
this
case,
these
were
police
officers.
one
of
them...
both
of
them
were
accused
of
tampering
with
agency
records
to
cover
up
misconduct,
and
the
arbitrator
recognized
that
the
employee
who
had
access
to
agency
records
should
not
be
returned
to
that
position,
specifically
ordered
that
upon
reinstatement
this
employee
should
not
be
returned
to
a
position
of
trust
such
as
he
had
occupied
before.
the
other
employee,
who
was
not
directly
involved
in
that
kind
of
tampering
with
records,
mr.
rogers,
who
was
just
guilty,
if
you
will,
of
picking
up
the
beer
and
misusing
a
government
vehicle
for
that
purpose,
there
was
no
such
limitation
in
his
case
because
it
was
not
appropriate
in
view
of
the
facts.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbie
well,
the
particular
officer,
your
honor,
to
answer
your
question,
was
returned
to
a
custodial
position.
now,
of
course,
that
involves
a
certain
amount
of
trust,
but
it
is
not
the
same
as
being
a
police
officer.
our
point
is
that
in
this
award,
the
arbitrator
did
not
violate
the
statute,
he
only
violated
an
interpretation
of
the
statute
made
by
the
merit
systems
protection
board.
the
board
can
never
have
the
union
before
it
as
a
party.
to
answer
the
question,
i
believe,
of
justice
brennan
concerning
whether
in
fact
the
union
could
represent
the
grievant
before
the
mspb,
the
merit
system
protection
board,
the
answer
is,
if
they
did
so,
it
would
be
out
of
good
will,
if
you
will.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbie
it
cannot.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbie
that's
correct.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbie
that's
correct.
and
the
significance
of
that
is
that
the
merit
system
protection
board
therefore
could
never
have
extended
the
rule
before
to
cover
violations
harmful
to
the
union
because
they
never
would
have
had
that
occasion.
the
union
has
never
been
before
the
board
as
a
party.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbie
your
honor,
no,
i
do
not.
again,
i
would--
mr.
charles
a.
hobbie
--i
believe
that
the
arbitrator
in
that
case
would
have
devised
a
remedy
different
from
reinstatement.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbie
i
think
that
in
that
particular
case,
and
i
am
assuming
that
there
have
been
pervasive
violations,
that
the
violations
have
been
repeated,
and
that
the
conduct,
the
misconduct
approaches
the
level,
for
example,
of
theft,
as
i
believe
you
suggested.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbie
no,
your
honor,
i
am
not.
certainly,
particularly
for
police
officers,
that
kind
of
misconduct
would
be
indeed
serious.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbie
yes,
i
would
agree.
that
would
be
the
same.
but
in
this
case
that
was
not
the
situation,
and
the
arbitrator--
mr.
charles
a.
hobbie
--procedurally
they
would
have.
the
difference,
however,
your
honor,
between
the
arbitral
context
and
the
merit
systems
protection
board
is
important
in
analyzing
that
particular
question.
the
arbitrator
is
given
a
certain
amount
of
discretion,
if
you
will,
in
the
arbitral
system.
that
discretion
is
reviewable
by
the
federal
circuit
court
of
appeals,
which
is
charged
by
statute
with,
if
you
will,
enforcing
the
overall
symmetry
of
the
system.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbie
we
wouldn't
be
here
today,
your
honor,
if
it
had
been
a
theft
case,
i
am
quite
sure.
i
believe
if
you
look
directly
at
the
language
of
the
award
and
note
the
circumstance
of
the
unions
participating
in
this
procedure
and
asserting
from
the
beginning
that
the
violations
of
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
so
tainted
the
evidence
before
the
arbitrator
that
the
union
wasn't
even
going
to
put
on
any
case,
and
they
didn't.
they
didn't
even
contest
the
misconduct.
the
arbitrator,
however,
expressly
declined
to
accept
the
union's
invitation
to
apply
some
sort
of
exclusionary
rule.
he
said
he
would
not
agree
with
the
union
that
this
kind
of
technical
procedural
violation
should
result
in
the
voiding
of
disciplinary
action.
he
specifically
refused...
he
refused
to
void
the
discipline
on
the
basis
of
minor,
if
you
will,
procedural
irregularities,
as
the
government
has
characterized
them.
what
he
did
do,
though,
was
to
mitigate
the
penalty.
he
examined
the
discipline
that
had
been
imposed,
and
he
said
that
under
the
circumstances,
in
view
of
the
totality
of
the
circumstances,
including
the
incident
of
the
previous
year
which
is
referred
to
in
the
award,
where
the
agency
had
pervasively
violated
the
agreement
before,
under
those
circumstances,
mitigation
of
the
penalty
was
appropriate.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbie
the
procedural
rights,
your
honor...
that's
correct,
your
honor,
but
the
procedural
rights
nevertheless
are
very
important
in
this
scheme,
particularly
when
one
recalls
that
procedures
are
the
only
thing
in
the
federal
sector
that
unions
may
bargain
over.
there
are
certain
management
rights
that
are
reserved
for
management
exclusively,
and
only
the
procedures
by
which
management
implements
that
authority
are
negotiable.
wages
in
the
federal
sector
are
not
negotiable.
they
are
set
by
statute.
most
conditions
of
work
are
set
by
statute.
therefore,
procedures
are
the
only
thing
that
is
negotiable.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbie
i
would
say
that
it
would
be
under
those
circumstances.
the
prerogative
of
the
arbitrator
to
make
that
kind
of
decision,
if
he
is
faced
with
an
agency
that
so
adamantly,
as
your
example
suggests,
refuses
to
follow
the
contractual
provisions.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbie
your
honor,
it
is
a
subjective
determination
as
to
whether
it
did
or
did
not,
and
the
arbitrator
must
make
that
decision.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbie
not
on
the
factfinding
process,
your
honor.
i
would
remind
the
court,
however,
that
these
employees
admitted
their
guilt
in
affidavits
executed
while
they
were
being
effectively
denied
representation
by
the
union.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbie
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbie
the
union
didn't
even,
in
this
arbitration,
contest
the
facts
of
the
misconduct,
your
honor,
because
they
felt
they
had
been
so
grievously
prejudiced.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbie
i
am
sorry,
your
honor.
i
am
not
sure
i
understand
your
question.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbie
no,
their
position
before
the
arbitrator
was--
mr.
charles
a.
hobbie
--that
there
was
no
case,
because
the
agency's
infractions
had
so
grievously
tainted
the
evidence
that
had
been
obtained
against
the
grievants
that
the
matter
could
not
be
supported
at
all.
all
of
the
evidence
should
be
excluded,
in
other
words.
that
was
the
union's
position,
and
the
arbitrator
did
not
accept
that
position.
he
refused
to
void
the
action,
and
instead
used
the
remedy
of
mitigating
the
penalties.
returning
to
the
question
of
what
would
be
a
proper
remedy,
i
believe,
that
justice
o'connor
posed,
it
is
possible
to
go
to
the
federal
labor
relations
authority
and
file
an
unfair
labor
practice
charge.
in
fact,
in
this
case,
that
is
exactly
what
the
union
did.
they
filed
a
charge
alleging
that
the
agency
had
violated
the
contract.
the
federal
labor
relations
authority,
which
is
charged
with
administering
the
labor
relations
statute,
declined
to
issue
a
charge
because
it
said
the
matter
was
more
appropriately
resolved
through
grievance
proceedings.
therefore,
the
union
would
be
in
the
position
of
having
to
go
back
and
file
another
grievance
before
a
different
arbitrator,
involving
a
whole
nother
proceeding,
additional
costs
for
both
the
union
and
the
agency,
of
course.
in
other
words,
it
would
be
a
waste
of
the
resources
of
the
government
and
the
union.
we
would
submit
that
in
the
facts
of
this
case
in
particular,
it
is
a
much
more
economic
use
of
resources
to
have
one
arbitrator
address
all
of
the
issues
that
happen
to
be
attached
to
a
certain
set
of
circumstances.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbie
justice
o'connor,
the
merit
system
protection
board,
however,
would
also
have
the
right
to
mitigate
a
penalty
based
upon
the
consideration
of
all
the
relevant
factors
in
the
record.
the
board
has
delineated
those
factors
in
a
case,
douglas
versus
veterans
administration.
they
delineated
factors
that
did
not
include,
i
will
admit,
violations
of
a
collective
bargaining
agreement,
but
again,
a
union
is
not
properly
before
the
mspb,
and
the
board
specifically
stated
there
that
these
were
not
exclusive
factors,
that
there
could
be
others.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbie
the
board
could
have
done
that
under
the...
in
my
own
opinion,
your
honor.
the
board
could
have
done
that.
in
fact,
as
i
said,
by
judging,
if
you
will,
the
appropriateness
of
a
particular
penalty,
the
board
does
that
all
of
the
time.
it
says
that
a
particular
penalty
is
not
appropriate,
constitutes
an
abuse
of
discretion
or
an
abuse
of
authority,
based
on
many
factors,
and
mitigates
a
penalty
without
using
the
harmful
error
rule.
it
is
important
to
realize
here
the
nature
of
the
differences
between
the
arbitral
context
and
the
merit
systems
protection
board,
and
how
congress
specified
in
the
statute
arbitration
and
collective
bargaining
were
to
fit
into
the
overall
scheme.
taking
the
latter
first,
in
title
7
of
the
civil
service
reform
act,
even
the
government
does
not
dispute
that
collective
bargaining
is
of
primary
importance,
and
that
the
intent
of
the
statute
was
to
promote
collective
bargaining.
in
that
scheme,
arbitration
was
expressly
the
mechanism
by
which
the
procedures
negotiated
in
collective
bargaining
were
to
be
enforced.
this
can
easily
be
seen
when
you
realize
that
in
the
previous
scheme,
under
the
executive
order,
executive
order
11491,
arbitration
was
not
mandatory.
the
congress
expressly
departed
from
this
past
practice,
if
you
will,
by
mandating
arbitration
in
the
new
scheme.
they
also
departed
from
the
scheme
under
the
executive
order
by
requiring
or
by
permitting,
i
should
say,
that
adverse
actions
could
be
aggrieved
and
arbitrated
under
the
new
scheme.
in
the
past,
adverse
actions
had
been
excluded,
had
been
excluded
from
the
coverage
of
grievance
procedures
negotiated
by
the
parties.
in
view
of
the
fact
that
the
union
is
the
one
who
selects
an
arbitrator,
in
fact,
invokes,
has
the
authority
whether
or
not
to
invoke
arbitration,
and
the
union
has
the
authority
to
negotiate
the
exclusion
of
adverse
actions
from
the
arbitral
process,
the
union
jointly
with
the
agency
selects
the
arbitrator,
pays
the
arbitrator,
pays
the
costs
of
the
arbitration,
in
view
of
all
of
these
circumstances
expressed
in
the
language
of
the
act,
the
courts
of
appeals
have
found
that
the
union
is
an
important
party
in
the
arbitral
process,
a
party
whose
significant
interests
are
to
be
protected.
the
government
implies
in
their
argument
that
some
kind
of
a
per
se
rule
is
here
involved,
that
any
kind
of
violation
of
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
could
cause
an
arbitrator
to
throw
out
this
discipline
that
has
been
imposed.
in
a
later
case,
devine
versus
brisco,
the
federal
circuit
addressed
this
exact
question,
and
held
that
there
must
be
a
demonstration
by
the
union
of
prejudice
to
its
rights,
and
the
kind
of
demonstration
that
the
court
was
talking
about
in
brisco
was
exactly
what
occurred
here,
and
they
referred
to
this,
the
filing
of
an
unfair
labor
practice
charge
indicating
that
the
union
in
fact
believed
that
its
rights
had
been
prejudiced
to
the
degree
that
they
are
going
to
file
a
charge.
in
the
face
of
brisco,
i
think
that
this
argument
of
the
government
cannot
really
be
given
any
credence.
clearly,
the
federal
circuit,
which
has
been
charged
with
the
oversight
of
this
whole
arbitral
process,
has
determined
that
contractual
violations
which
are
demonstrably
harmful
to
the
union
have
to
be
considered.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbie
that's
correct,
your
honor,
and
that's
a
very
important
addition
to
what
i
said,
because
in
fact
we
are
talking
about
the
integrity
of
the
whole
collective
bargaining
process
here,
and
the
only
effective
mechanism
to
really
preserve
the
integrity
of
that
process.
a
very
important
question
would
be,
what
would
be
the
effect
of
this
court's
refusing
to
permit
an
arbitrator
to
so
mitigate
penalties.
we
would
submit
that
this
would
result
in
the
subordination
of
arbitration
and
the
statutory
scheme
to
the
point
where
it
would
virtually
disappear
as
a
mechanism.
the
union,
which
again
has
the
power
to
invoke
arbitration,
is
hardly
going
to
invoke
it
if
it
feels
that
arbitration
is
going
to
be
a
completely
ineffectual
remedy.
there
would
be
no
incentive
for
the
union
to
expend
its
resources
unless
it
believes
that
the
arbitrator
who
has
been
selected
by
the
parties
is
actually
going
to
be
able
to
effectuate
a
remedy
that
protects
the
union's
interests.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbie
distinguished
from
the
grievant's
interest
to
a
certain
degree,
your
honor.
the
union's
interests--
mr.
charles
a.
hobbie
--yes.
the
union's
interests
are,
after
all,
the
collective
interests
of
the
employees
it
represents.
we
are
not
talking
about
purely
institutional
interests
like
the
collection
of
dues
and
things
like
this,
obviously.
here
we
are
talking
about
prejudice
to
the
rights
of
the...
the
collective
rights,
if
you
will,
of
the
members
of
the
bargaining
unit,
and
this
would
include
the
grievants,
of
course.
they
are
also
members
of
the
bargaining
unit.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbie
that
is
correct,
your
honor,
but
that
interpretation
of
the
statutory
harmful
error
rule
is
the
mspb's
interpretation,
and
we
are
saying
that
that
interpretation
does
not
necessarily
relate
to
the
arbitral
process,
because
the
union
cannot
be
a
party
before
the
merit
system
protection
board.
had
they
argued
that
before
the
board,
the
board
might
have
adopted
that
position,
but
they
could
not
have.
it
would
have
been
an
impossibility.
so,
what
the
government
is
alleging
is
merely
that
it
is...
the
arbitration
award
is
inconsistent
with
an
interpretation
of
law.
the
federal
circuit
and
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
have
repeatedly
held
in
three
different
cases
that
nothing
in
the
civil
service
reform
act
requires
that
the
standards
be
applied
in
exactly
the
same
way.
we
would
admit,
and
it
is
plain
in
the
language
of
the
statute,
that
congress
intended
the
standards
of
proof
and
the
burdens
of
proof,
if
you
will,
to
be
uniformly
applied
in
both
parallel
appeals
processes,
arbitration
and
before
the
merit
system
protection
board.
but
the
fact
that
congress
has
chosen
to
impose
a
certain
symmetry
on
the
appeals
processes
to
discourage,
as
the
government
has
said,
forum
shopping,
and
to
promote
consistency
in
adjudications,
does
not
mean
that
in
every
application
of
the
statute,
of
the
standards
of
proof,
that
arbitrations
must
be
exactly
the
same
as
the
mspb
proceedings.
in
devine
versus
sutermeister
in
the
federal
circuit,
this
question
was
expressly
addressed
by
the
federal
circuit,
which
concurred
in
the
prior
holding
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
circuit.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbie
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbie
cannot
be.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbie
that's
correct.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbie
the
board...
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbie
yes,
because...
i
will
clarify
that.
i
don't
disagree
with
the
interpretation
that
the
board
has
put
on
the
harmful
error
rule
with
respect
to
the
individual
grievants.
that
is
not
the
question
in
this
case.
i
think
the
government
would
concede
that
with
respect
to
the
individual
grievants
here,
the
arbitrator
correctly
applied
the
harmful
error
rule.
he
refused
to
touch
the
penalty
imposed
because
of
his
finding
that
they
were
not
prejudiced.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbie
the
board,
your
honor,
has
not
had
occasion
to
interpret
the--
mr.
charles
a.
hobbie
--well,
there
is
no
conflict,
we
would
submit,
between
this
award--
mr.
charles
a.
hobbie
--your
honor,
in
this
case,
that
is
not
an
issue.
we
do
not
disagree
with
what
the
board
has
said.
it
is
the
government
that
is
saying
that
because
of
the
board's
interpretation
of
the
statute,
this
arbitrator's
decision
is
inconsistent
with
law,
because
it
is
inconsistent
with
the
board's
interpretation.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbie
we
would
disagree
with
that,
yes.
clearly
our
position
is
that
the
arbitrator
correctly
and
could
easily
extend
the
application
of
this
harmful
error
rule
to
protect
the
interests
of
other
parties
in
this
separate
process.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbie
that's
correct,
your
honor,
and
nothing
else
in
the
statute
requires
that
the
arbitrator
follow
board
precedent.
nothing
requires
that
an
arbitrator
follow
the
precedents
of
the
merit
system
protection
board.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbie
or
the
other
way
around.
that's
correct.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbie
of
course,
your
honor,
that
is
correct.
an
arbitrator
cannot
make
an
award
that
is
inconsistent
with
law,
or
for
that
matter
with
the
precedents,
the
binding
precedents
of
the
federal
circuit
court
of
appeals.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbie
the
government
is
relying,
however,
on
an
interpretation
by
the
merit
system
protection
board,
which
does
not,
in
our
opinion--
mr.
charles
a.
hobbie
--yes,
your
honor,
clearly.
we
would
submit
that
that
interpretation
is
wrong.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbie
we
are
left
in
the
private
sector...
we
wish
to
emphasize
this...
with
the
arbitral
mechanism
to
enforce
the
negotiated
rights
of
the
employees
represented
by
unions,
striking
down
the
approach
followed
by
the
award
at
bar,
which
was
to
balance
the
competing
interests
of
the
agency--
mr.
charles
a.
hobbie
--the
federal
labor
relations
authority
in
the
context
of
an
unfair
labor
practice
complaint,
could
also
order
the
remedy
of
reinstatement
based
upon
violations
of
the
statute
or
pervasive
and
repeated
violations
of
the
contract.
of
course,
in
this
case,
as
you
pointed
out,
they
chose
not
to.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbie
they
could
also
issue
a
cease
and
desist
order,
although
again
the
fact
that
the
agency
had
previously
apparently
ignored
an
arbitrator's
determination--
mr.
charles
a.
hobbie
--well,
an
arbitrator
is
supposed
to
be
a
parallel
process
in
the
context
of
adverse
actions.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbie
in
which
the
union,
though,
in
the
arbitral
context,
is
a
co-party,
if
you
will,
if
not
the
most
important
party,
as
the
two
courts
of
appeals
have
found.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbie
in
the
context
of
the
grievance
procedures,
most
contracts
provide
that
the
union
must
be
notified,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbie
by
the
agency,
which
is
the
other
party--
mr.
charles
a.
hobbie
--the
employer.
the
employing
agency.
that
discipline
is
being
proposed.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbie
yes.
in
fact,
that
might
be
an
example
of
when
a
harmful
error
might
have
been
corrected,
and
therefore
would
not
have
harmed
the
rights
of
the
union.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbie
the
employee
may
file
a
grievance,
or
the
union
may
file
a
grievance.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbie
no,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbie
the
grievance
was
filed
by
the
employees
with
notice
to
the
union.
there
is
no
question
about
that.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbie
the
grievance
was
processed
through
a
number
of
steps,
and
at
the
conclusion
of
the
two
or
three
steps--
mr.
charles
a.
hobbie
--yes,
the
employees
were
there
and
the
union
was
represented.
at
the
conclusion
of
those
steps,
the
union--
mr.
charles
a.
hobbie
--yes,
that's
correct.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbie
then
the
union
is
faced
with
the
option
of
electing
arbitration
or
not.
if
it
chooses
not
to
elect
arbitration,
that
is
the
end
of
the
process.
the
employee
is
foreclosed
from
going
anywhere
else.
he
cannot
then
file
an
appeal
to
the
merit
system
protection
board.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbie
if
the
union
elects
arbitration,
they
proceed
to
arbitration
under
the
procedures
negotiated
by
the
union
and
the
agency.
in
other
words,
when,
how,
why--
mr.
charles
a.
hobbie
--well,
in
this
particular
case,
your
honor,
the
union
hypothetically,
had
they
been
present
at
the
time
of
the
investigation,
the
investigatory
interviews
with
these
officers--
mr.
charles
a.
hobbie
--it
did
not.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbie
the
employees
filed
the
grievance.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbie
in
this
case.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbie
no,
the
employees
did
notify
the
union,
your
honor.
that
is
not
a
problem
in
this
case.
what
is
a
problem
is
that
the
union
was
unaware
at
first
of
the
investigation,
and
the
employees
were
never
afforded
the
opportunity
to
have
the
union
present
during
the
investigation
and
at
the
time
they
executed
these
admissions
of
guilt.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbie
the
arbitrator
did
not
indicate
that
they
knew
of
the
right
to
have
the
union
present.
he
merely
said
that
because
they
were
police
officers,
in
the
execution
of
these
all-important
admissions
of
guilt,
they
were
aware
of
their
right
not
to
do
this.
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
my
time
has
expired.
thank
you.
