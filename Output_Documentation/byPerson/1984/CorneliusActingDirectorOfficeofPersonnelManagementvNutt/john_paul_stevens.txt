justice
stevens
may
i
just
ask
this
one
question?
other
than
the
argument
that
it
would
duplicate
proceedings,
is
there
any
reason
to
believe
that
an
unfair
labor
practice
proceeding
would
be
an
inadequate
remedy
for
the
wrong
that
you
are
vindicating
here?
justice
stevens
they
could
also
issue
a
cease
and
desist
order,
couldn't
they?
justice
stevens
ignored
an
arbitrator,
but
that
is
why
i
wonder
if
the
arbitrator
is
really
the
most
effective
tribunal
for
granting
relief
to
the
union.
justice
stevens
but
adverse
actions
between
the
employee
and
the
government.
