justice
o'connor
mr.
rothfeld,
what
remedies
do
you
propose
for
the
union
under
your
view
of
the
case
to
enforce
the
terms
of
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
in
this
regard?
justice
o'connor
except
that
it
deprives
the
employer
of
a
right
to
discharge
an
employee
that
legally
is
dischargable.
that
is
the
problem.
