we
will
hear
arguments
next
in
devine
against
nutt.
mr.
rothfeld,
i
think
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
burger
could
the
government
begin
all
over
again
and
remedy
the
defects
seen
by
the
court?
chief
justice
burger
on
this
holding
of
the
court
of
appeals,
would
it
be
correct
to
say
that
it
wouldn't
make
any
difference
what
the
offenses
of
these
employees
were?
chief
justice
burger
it
would
be...
they
would
be
in
the
same
boat
if
they
had
been
caught
selling
drugs,
or
caught
stealing
typewriters?
chief
justice
burger
purely
a
procedural
problem.
chief
justice
burger
do
you
agree
with
your
friend
that
if
these
two
men
had
been
caught
selling
narcotics,
heroin
and
what-not,
this
situation
would
be
the
same
as
it
is
now?
chief
justice
burger
what
do
you
think
the
remedy
would
have
been?
chief
justice
burger
would
you
suggest
some
alternatives?
what
might
he
have
done?
chief
justice
burger
well,
just
they
caught
them
selling
heroin
once.
are
you
suggesting
that
once
isn't
a
serious
matter?
chief
justice
burger
or
stealing
typewriters.
chief
justice
burger
procedurally,
might
they
not
have
come
out
just
where
they
came
out?
chief
justice
burger
so
you
are
suggesting
that
if
it
had
been
a
drug
case
or
a
theft
of
a
typewriter,
then
they
might
have
come
to
a
different
result?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
have
anything
further,
mr.
rothfeld?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
gentleman.
the
case
is
submitted.
