are
there
lots
of
positions
in
the
federal
government
that
don't
involve
trust?
justice
rehnquist
even
though
nothing
in
this
particular
employee's
record
would
deserve
mitigation.
in
effect,
the
agency
is
being
required
to
take
back
an
employee
that
it
ought
not
to
take
back
because
the
agency
has
violated
procedural
rights.
it
made
no
difference
in
this
case.
justice
rehnquist
well,
supposing
that
you
have
six
people
who
have
done
what
the
most
serious
offender
of
these
particular
two
did,
and
the
arbitrator
says,
well,
you
know,
this
agency
hasn't
just
violated
the
procedures
once.
it
has
violated
them
three
or
four
times,
and
i
have
admonished
them
before.
in
fact,
i
mitigated
an
award,
or
mitigated
a
discharge
last
year.
i
don't
know
how
i
am
going
to
bring
them
to...
i
am
going
to
order
all
six
of
these
people
reinstated.
now,
do
you
think
that
is
a
proper
decision
of
the
arbitrator?
justice
rehnquist
even
though
the
violation
of
the
contractual
provisions
had
no
effect
on
the
factfinding
process
in
this
particular
arbitration?
justice
rehnquist
did
the
arbitrator
here,
in
the
case
before
us,
make
the
determination
that
the
violations
of
the
procedure
by
the
agency
did
have
an
effect
on
the
factfinding
process?
justice
rehnquist
--when
you
say
the
union's
interests,
do
you
mean
the
union's
interests
as
distinguished
from
the
grievant's
interest?
justice
rehnquist
in
the
immediate
case.
justice
rehnquist
and
this
individual
grievant
may
have
been
denied
a
right,
but
it
was
found
to
be
harmless,
that
it
had
no
effect
on
the
outcome.
justice
rehnquist
isn't
there
some
indication
in
the
record
that
the
employees
knew
of
their
right
to
have
the
union
present,
and
just
didn't
either
feel
it
worthwhile
or
didn't
bother
to
call
the
union
people?
justice
rehnquist
oh,
i
see.
even
though
the
grievance
procedure
is
available
to
them
because
they
are
union
members
at
the
beginning,
they
can
elect
to
go
to
the
board.
