justice
white
it
is
more
like
double
jeopardy.
justice
white
well,
that
may
be
so.
that
just
goes,
however,
to
what
we
would
do
if
we
happened
to
agree
with
the
government.
justice
white
it
just
goes
to
whether
we
would
decide
it
here
or
remand.
it
hasn't
got
anything
to
do
with
appealability.
justice
white
and
keith
is
irrelevant.
justice
white
well,
i
suppose
sooner
or
later
the
court
of
appeals
is
going
to
get
the
case
anyway
on
the
qualified
immunity
issue.
if
the
plaintiffs
win,
these
cases
are
going
to
be
there
anyway.
justice
white
that
may
be
so.
i
was
just
responding
to
your
saying
that
would
be
an
unusual
number
of
appeals
on
qualified
immunity.
justice
white
well,
if
that's
correct,
why
should
a
district
court...
why
shouldn't
a
district
court
be
obligated
to
decide
the
case
under
a
statute
before
it
even
reaches
the
constitutional
issue?
justice
white
well,
in
order
to
invoke
the
statute,
you
have
to
have
a
phony
national
security
claim.
justice
white
well,
all
right.
justice
white
you
have
to
decide
the
national
security
issue.
justice
white
why
should
appellate
courts...
this
goes
to
appealability,
too,
i
suppose.
why
should
appellate
courts
be
wrestling
with
qualified
immunity
issues
in
bivens
claims
if
there
is
a
statutory
possibility
that
there
wouldn't
be
any
bivens
immunity
issue
at
all?
justice
white
well--
justice
white
--you
say
the
case
was
over
and
you
were
about
to
have
a
trial
on
damages
for
a
bivens...
on
a
bivens
basis,
right?
justice
white
well,
i
am
not
sure
the
case
should
even
have
gotten
to
that
point
until
you
decided
whether
there
was
a
statutory
issue.
justice
white
well,
it
cautioned
lawyers,
too.
