mr.
paul
m.
bator
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
in
this
case
the
solicitor
general
represents
former
attorney
general
john
n.
mitchell
in
a
lawsuit
that
was
filed
13
years
ago,
in
1972.
during
these
13
years
the
court
system
has
been
struggling
to
solve
the
question
whether
mr.
mitchell
should
personally
pay
damages
to
the
plaintiff
because
in
1970
he
as
attorney
general
authorized
a
telephone
tap
on
the
phone
of
one
davidon.
this
was
in
december,
1970,
and
this
telephone
tap
lead
to
the
overhearing
of
three
conversations
to
which
the
plaintiff
was
a
party.
mr.
paul
m.
bator
not
specifically.
davidon
was
the
target
of
the
tap,
your
honor.
davidon
was
tapped
because
the
fbi
had
information
that
there
was
an
organization
called
eccsl,
of
which
davidon
was
a
member,
which
was
planning
to
blow
up
the
utility
tunnels
under
the
federal
triangle
here
in
washington,
d.c.--
there
was
also
fbi
information
that
eccl
members,
including
davidon,
had
discussed
the
possibility
of
kidnapping
dr.
henry
kissinger,
who
was
then
assistant
to
the
president
for
national
security
affairs.
the
district
court
made
an
elaborate
inquiry
into
the
purpose
of
these
taps,
and
explicitly
found
that
they
were
installed
in
order
to
protect
the
national
security
by
obtaining
information
and
preventing
these
bombing
and
kidnapping
activities.
and
i
refer
the
court
to
the
district
court
opinion
at
56
to
60
of
the
appendix
to
our
petition,
where
the
district
court
makes
it
clear
that
the
purpose
was
prevention,
not
prosecution.
now,
at
the
time
these
wiretaps
were
authorized,
this
court's
keith
case,
which
for
the
first
time
held
that
a
warrant
had
to
be
obtained
for
wiretaps
involving
domestic
national
security
concerns,
that
case
had
not
yet
been
decided.
the
keith
case,
in
which
the
court
itself
stated
that
it
was
deciding
a
question
of
first
impression,
came
down
in
'72,
a
year
and
a
half
after
these
wiretaps
were
placed
and
removed.
these
wiretaps
were
placed
on
the
basis
of
a
legal
position
that
had
been
maintained
in
an
unbroken
tradition
by
every
attorney
general
and
every
president
for
over
25
years.
mr.
paul
m.
bator
my
research,
your
honor,
shows
simply
that
it
was...
there
are
things
in
this
record
that
indicate
in
25
years--
mr.
paul
m.
bator
--that
may
very
well
be,
your
honor.
in
the
packet
that
we
have,
the
first
thing
we
have
is
from
attorney
general
brownell.
the
position
was,
the
substance
of
the
position
was
that
the
president
did
have
constitutional
authority
without
a
judicial
warrant
to
order
electronic
surveillances
where
he
was
acting
to
protect
the
national
security
against
threats
of
domestic
violence
and
terrorism.
at
the
time
the
davidon
tap
was
installed,
that
position
had
never
been
rejected
in
any
federal
court,
and
had
recently
been
upheld
in
two
federal
district
courts.
now,
of
course
that
position
was
rejected
by
this
court
in
keith,
and
this
case
is
really
one
of
a
number
of
cases
in
which
the
courts
have
been
struggling
with
the
question
of
what
to
do
about
pre-keith
taps,
how
do
we
untangle
the
question
of
what
to
do
about
these
surveillances,
that
took
place
without
a
judicial
warrant
at
a
time
when
the
legal
situation
was
subject
to
fundamental
uncertainty.
mr.
paul
m.
bator
well,
your
honor,
we
agree,
and
i
am
happy
to
turn
to
it
if
you
would
like
me
to,
although
i
do
want
to
come
back
and
say
perhaps
a
word
or
two
about
the
merits
of
the
qualified
immunity
issue.
the
appealability
issue
arises
because
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
a
district
judge's
rejection
of
a
defendant's
claim
of
qualified
immunity
does
not
at
that
point
become
appealable.
the
defendant
has
to
wait
until
the
case
goes
to
final
judgment,
that
means
usually
after
trial
and
after...
after
discovery
and
after
trial,
before
he
appeals.
the
courts
of
appeals
are
simply
divided
three
to
three
on
this
issue,
and
that
is
why
we
are
here,
and
i
have
four,
i
think,
simple
points
to
make
about
appealability,
justice
o'connor.
the
first
one
is
about
this
court's
cases.
this
court's
cases
on
appealability
are
not
easily
organized
into
a
tidy
scheme,
but
the
cases
do
convey
one
central
unifying
theme,
and
that
is
that
if
postponing
appeal
until
the
end
of
the
case
would
in
some
serious
way
undermine
or
subvert
the
policies
of
the
very
rule
whose
correct
application
is
in
question,
then
the
considerations
are
very
strongly
in
favor
of
immediate
appeal
if
certain
technical
requirements,
if
the
court
of
appeals
is
in
a
position
effectively
and
definitively
to
decide
the
question
at
this
point.
that,
we
think,
is
the
thrust
of
abney
and
helstoski,
united
states
v.
nixon,
nixon
v.
fitzgerald.
if
a
district
court
rules,
rejects
a
defense
whose
purpose
is
to
give
a
threshold
immunity
to
the
burdens
of
discovery
at
trial,
then
appeal
should
be
permitted.
mr.
paul
m.
bator
your
honor,
we
do
not
think
that
there
was
really
any
relevant
factual
dispute
at
all.
in
fact,
the
district
court
here
ruled
that
qualified
immunity
may
not
be
had
as
a
matter
of
law.
the
district
court
had
no
problem
in
ruling
with
this
question
as
a
matter
of
law,
and
we
think
it
can
be
easily
ruled
on
now
as
a
matter
of
law.
the
record
shows,
without
any
problems,
with
multiple
support,
and
the
district
court
found
that
the
purpose
of
the
wiretap
was
to
find
out
about
and
prevent
these
threats
to
the
national
security.
there
is
ample,
ample
basis
on
this
record
to
do
exactly
what
the
court
in
harlow
said
the
courts
ought
to
try
to
do
with
these
cases,
which
is
to
take
the
objective
facts
and
determine
whether
on
the
basis
of
the
objective
facts
there
was
or
was
not
a
violation
of
a
clearly
established
constitutional
rule.
now,
the
respondent
says,
no,
you
can't
do
that
here
and
you
can't
do
it
anywhere,
because
these
qualified
immunity
rulings
are
always
mixed
up
and
complicated
issues
of
fact
and
purpose
and
motive,
but
we
think
that
that
is
just
another
way
of
saying
that
this
court,
when
it
tried
in
harlow
to
create
an
objective
test
that
could
be
determined
on
the
basis
of
a
threshold
inquiry
as
a
quick,
if
you
will,
a
quick
cure
on
the
issue,
in
order
to
serve
the
very
purposes
of
the
rule,
the
court
said,
we
will
try
to
structure
the
inquiry
so
we
can
have
a
definitive
objective
ruling.
and
what
the
respondent
is
really
saying
here
is
that
this
court
simply
won't
be
allowed
to
do
or
simply
didn't
know
what
it
was
about
when
it
was
doing
that.
that
is
to
say
that
that
is
not
possible.
we
think
it
is
totally
unproblematical
for
an
appellate
court
to
do
exactly
what
the
district
court
does
at
that
point,
which
is
to
decide
as
a
matter
of
law
is
the
defendant
entitled
to
qualified
immunity,
and
we
think
that
this
quick
appeal
is
absolutely
crucial
to
achieving
the
purposes
of
harlow.
what
was
the
point
of
harlow?
mr.
paul
m.
bator
i
hadn't
planned
to,
your
honor,
and
i
am
not
really
prepared,
2520
being--
mr.
paul
m.
bator
--the
title
3.
mr.
paul
m.
bator
your
honor,
our
position
on
that
is
that
2520
doesn't
limit
because
title
3
is
basically
inapplicable
to
this
entire
situation.
that
is,
2520
only
is
in
play
if
the
plaintiff
has
a
good
cause
of
action
under
title
3.
mr.
paul
m.
bator
then
it
may
be
that
2520
might
limit,
although
we
haven't
briefed
that
issue,
your
honor,
and
it
might
be
that
the
clearly
established
rule
might
still
operate.
mr.
paul
m.
bator
our
position
is
that
title
3
is
totally
inapplicable--
mr.
paul
m.
bator
--and
this
court
made
that
absolutely
clear
in
keith,
so
the
court
doesn't
really
need
to
reach
the
question
of
what
would
be
the
situation
with
respect
to
immunity.
mr.
paul
m.
bator
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
paul
m.
bator
your
honor,
our
submission
on
the
appealability
question
is--
mr.
paul
m.
bator
--i
believe
so,
your
honor.
mr.
paul
m.
bator
i
believe
so.
mr.
paul
m.
bator
we
don't
understand
that
the
case
really--
mr.
paul
m.
bator
--i
don't
believe
so,
your
honor,
and
of
course
it
is
on
the
bivens
issue
where
the
issue
of
qualified
immunity
and
its
appealability
arises,
so
we
believe
that
really
is
the
only
issue
on
which
we
are
here,
as
far
as
our
petition
for
certiorari
goes.
i
want
to
return
to
appealability
and
its
connection
with
the
purpose
of
the
harlow
rule,
because
that
really
is
our
central
submission
to
this
court.
the
purpose
of
harlow
was
to
provide
a
definitive
pretrial
adjudication,
and
what
all
of
this
court's
cases
say
is
that
if
the
purpose
of
a
rule
is
to
prevent
a
defendant
from
having
to
undergo
the
burdens
of
discovery
and
trial,
as
in
the
case
of
qualified
immunity,
that
that
should
be
resolved
as
quickly
as
possible
at--
mr.
paul
m.
bator
--well,
we
think
there
is
a
critical
distinction.
that
is
to
say,
it
is
the
case
that
there
are
a
lot
of
defenses
which
have
as
a
point
the
purpose
of
ending...
preventing
an
unmeritorious
trial,
and
we
do
agree
that
if
that
is
the
only
claim
that
could
be
made,
that
is,
appeal
now
in
order
to
prevent
the
defendant
from
having
to
go
through
an
unmeritorious
trial,
that
would
be
the
case
with
the
statute
of
limitations
defense
or
a
res
judicata
defense.
but
we
think
there
is
a
critical
distinction.
the
qualified
immunity
doctrine
has
an
additional
element.
qualified
immunity
treats...
allows
defendants
to
evade
the
burdens
of
discovery
at
trial
not
simply
as
a
matter
of
fairness
to
the
individual
defendant.
there
is
a
matter
of
general
public
policy
here.
that
is
to
create
a
general
rule,
a
general
regime
in
which
officials
at
the
time
they
are
making
decisions
are
not
unduly
chilled
and
constrained
in
decisionmaking
by
the
prospect
of
burdensome
litigation,
unmeritorious
litigation,
and
possible
ruinous
personal
recovery.
now,
as
the
justification
for
expedited
appeal
in
the
context
of
qualified
immunity
is
that
if
appeal
is
postponed
this
general
public
policy
will
be
eroded
and
compromised.
now,
that
claim
cannot
be
made
about
defenses
such
as
12(b)(6)
or
statute
of
limitations
or
res
judicata.
mr.
paul
m.
bator
i
think,
your
honor,
that
the
sort
of
the
central,
central
theme
of
distinction
is
that
it
is
not
enough
for
a
defendant
to
say
i
want
to
come
up
now,
because
otherwise
i
will
have
to
go
through
a
trial,
and
yet
i
have
a
good
defense.
i
shouldn't
have
to
do
it.
mr.
paul
m.
bator
it
is
more
like
double
jeopardy.
it
is
more
like
legislative
immunity.
mr.
paul
m.
bator
it
is
like--
mr.
paul
m.
bator
--that
is
to
say
the
central
theme
here
is,
what
is
the
effect
of
the
system
of
appeal
on
the
underlying
policy
of
the
rule.
the
harlow
rule
with
the
absolute
immunity
rule
with
the
double
jeopardy
rule
has
the
special
public
purpose.
mr.
paul
m.
bator
your
honor,
if
i
am
going
to
be
precise,
i
would
make
the
argument
not
only
where
there
are
no
disputes,
but
only
insofar
as
there
are
no
disputes.
that
is
to
say,
even
if
there
is
a
dispute
about
the
fact,
the
district
court
must
rule
whether
the
plaintiff's
version
of
the
facts,
taking
the
plaintiff's
complaint
as
true,
whether
the
facts
as
stated
in
the
plaintiff's
complaint
constitute
a
violation
of
a
clearly
established
constitutional
rule,
so
that
even
though
the
defendant
disputes
the
facts,
there
is
still
the
question
whether
even
on
the
plaintiff's
facts,
qualified
immunity
does
or
does
not
obtain,
and
that
would
be
available
as
an
issue
of
law.
this
is
an
absolutely
conventional
problem
both
for
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
of
passing
only
on
those
issues
which
it
is
now
entitled
to
pass
on
as
a
matter
of
law,
but
the
whole
point
of
harlow
was
to
make
as
many
of
these
issues
into
issues
of
law
as
possible.
that
was
the
whole
point,
because
as
the
court
said
in
davis
and
scherer,
and
this
is
the
central
point,
an
official
can
be
unburdened
from
the
chilling
effect
of
unmeritorious
litigation
only
if
the
qualified
immunity
issue
is,
and
i
think
i
am
quoting
the
court's
language,
is
quickly
settled.
now,
we
think
expedited
appeal
is
an
adjunct
to
the
policy
of
harlow
in
getting
a
quick
settlement
of
the
issue
of
qualified
immunity,
and
we
are
not
saying
that
every
qualified
immunity
issue
should
be
settled
on
appeal,
because
there
will
be
case
where
it
depends
entirely
on
what
the
defendant
did,
but
the
court
is
conventionally
used
to
separating
out
the
question
of
whether
as
a
matter
of
law
just
on
the
plaintiff's
complaint
or
on
the
undisputed
facts
the
defendant
is
or
is
not
entitled.
now,
i
would
like
to
just
supplement
what
i
also
said
to
the
chief
justice.
it
isn't
just
the
immunity
cases
that
present
this
central
theme.
the
state
court
cases
that
come
up
to
this
court
under
1257,
potts
and
tornelo
and
curry
and
landau,
they
also
share
this
common
theme.
there
we
have
various
constitutional
defenses
that
are
rejected
by
the
state
court.
the
state
litigation
is
not
over,
but
the
court
always
says,
if
the
point
of
the
constitutional
defense
is
to
prevent
the
defendant
from
being
hauled
into
the
state
court
system,
that
is
a
very
strong
argument
in
favor
of
expedited
appeal,
and
what
the
court
said
in
cox
was
exactly.
this
is
a
case
where
if
the
constitutional
defense
has
merit,
there
shouldn't
be
a
trial
at
all.
now,
where
that
is
the
strong
public
policy,
we
think
that
expedited
appeal
simply
is
an
adjunct
to
that
public
policy,
and
that
is
why
there
should
be
expedited
appeal.
i
think
that
this
case
presents
a
vivid
example
of
why
if
qualified
immunity
is
going
to
work,
expedited
appeal
really
is
a
necessary
adjunct.
here
is
a
case
where
one
would
think
that
qualified
immunity
ought
to
be
an
overwhelmingly
accepted
proposition.
i
mean,
here
is
a
case
where
attorney
general
mitchell
acted
on
a
question
that
the
court
had
explicitly
reserved
in
the
katz
case,
a
question
as
to
which
members
of
this
court
had
expressed
disagreement
individually.
justice
white,
justice
douglas
had
written
about
it.
the
lower
court
authority
was
overwhelmingly
in
favor
of
the
government
position.
twenty-five
years
of
executive
practice,
the
position
was
controversial.
now,
out
of
this
picture,
to
concoct
a
so-called
clearly
established
constitutional
right,
we
submit,
is
to
make
the
harlow
rule
a
joke.
if
this
is
a
clearly
established
constitutional
rule,
we
think
that
the
harlow
rule
becomes
an
empty
shell,
simply
an
invitation
retroactively
to
sort
of
invent
clearly
established
rights
out
of
bits
and
pieces
of
what
is
in
fact
very
controversial
and
uncertain
law.
now,
if
it
is
the
consequence
of
really
such
a
patently
unsupportable
ruling
that
then
the
defendant
has
to
go
through
the
whole
affair
of
a
very
burdensome
process
of
discovery
and
trial,
then
it
seems
to
me
harlow
becomes
a
very,
very
attenuated
rule
in
its
purpose.
we
would
also
like
on
behalf
of
the
government,
your
honors,
to
urge
the
court
if
it
finds
that
this
issue
is
an
appealable
issue,
that
it
should
turn
to
the
qualified
immunity
issue
and
decide
it
for
itself
and
not
remand
it
to
get
the
third
circuit's--
mr.
paul
m.
bator
--well,
your
honor,
this
court
in
one
of
its
precedents...
it
does
not
explicitly
have
anything
to
do
with
this
case,
but
one
of
this
court's
precedents,
the
helstoski
case,
holds
that
there
should
be
an
immediate
appeal
if
a
speech
and
debate
clause
defense
is
rejected.
your
honor,
we
think
that
the
materials
are
at
hand
for
a
resolution
of
the
qualified
immunity
issue
in
this
court
now.
we
don't
think
that
it
is
an
easy
question.
we
don't
think
a
remand
would
serve
much
purpose.
indeed,
if
there
is
a
remand
and
the
third
circuit
holds
that
there
is
no
qualified
immunity,
that
would
produce
a
clear
conflict
between
it
and
the
ninth
and
the
d.c.
circuits,
so
the
question
would
just
come
back
up
again.
we
hope,
therefore,
that
if
the
court
finds
that
the
qualified
immunity
issue
is
properly
here,
that
is,
was
properly
on
appeal,
that
it
should
decide
it
without
a
remand.
i
want
to
say
a
quick
word
about
the
contention
of
the
government
that
in
any
event
attorney
general
mitchell
should
be
shielded
by
absolute
immunity
in
this
case,
and
our
submission
on
this
case
comes
really
from
this
court's
own
words
in
harlow,
where
the
court
said
that
aides
entrusted
with
discretionary
authority
in
such
sensitive
areas
as
national
security
or
foreign
policy,
absolute
immunity
might
well
be
justified
to
protect
the
unhesitating
performance
of
functions
vital
to
the
national
interest.
very
briefly,
our
submission
is
this.
in
this
extremely
sensitive
and
difficult
area,
a
regime
of
qualified
immunity,
no
matter
how
you
tailor
it,
nevertheless
still
leaves
open
a
wide
degree
of
debilitating
exposure
to
high
government
officials
making
discretionary
determinations.
this
is
not
a
bush
league
affair.
every
attorney
general
since
bivens
has
been
decided
has
been
beleaguered
and
bedeviled
by
these
actions.
this
is
not
a
matter
that
is
just
vietnam.
this
is
not
a
matter
that
is
just
watergate.
judge
barrow
left
office
with
dozens
of
damage
actions
against
him
personally.
attorney
general
levy
was
here
for
a
year
and
a
half.
he
left
with
33
lawsuits,
of
which
at
least
a
dozen
totalled
$1
million
hanging
over
him
in
personal
damage
actions.
now,
that
is
a
regime
which
we
are
not
attacking
generally.
what
we
are
saying
is
that
if
the
government
is
faced
with
the
question
of
dealing
with
domestic
violence,
assassination,
and
terrorism,
and
that
is
no
joke
any
longer
either,
that
to
put
our
attorneys
general
under
the
constraint
of
this
kind
of
litigation
seems
to
us
to
exact
too
great
a
sacrifice
from
the
country.
it
is
not
our
submission
that
the
attorney
general
should
be
above
the
law.
it
is
simply
that
among
the
cluster
of
remedies
available,
the
cost
of
the
personal
damage
action
exacts
too
high
a
cost.
mr.
paul
m.
bator
your
honor,
our
absolute
immunity
claim
is
generally
with
respect
to
preventive
action
in
the
national
security
field.
now,
the
wiretap
situation
is
much
more
complicated,
because
in
1978
the
congress
repealed
the
provision
of
title
3
which
this
court
in
keith
said
took
national
security
taps
out
of
title
3.
now,
that
then
subdivides
into
two
branches.
foreign
security
wiretaps
have
a
regime
of
their
own
now
under
the
'78
act.
i
think
the
government
is
faced
with
the
situation
that
as
it
reads
the
statute,
as
a
result
of
that
repeal
a
wiretap,
a
domestic
national
security
wiretap
that
was
placed
today,
after
the
'78
was
passed,
would
come
under
title
3.
mr.
paul
m.
bator
and
you
would
need
a
warrant.
that
is
because
of
the
change
in
scene,
but
congress
made
it
perfectly
plain
in
'78
that
it
was
not
dealing
retroactively,
so
that
the
wiretap
situation
is
really
sui
generis
now,
and
there
may
be
a
very
problematical
gap
in
the
whole
situation,
because
title
3...
there
may
be
very
serious
domestic
national
security
cases
where
we
can't
satisfy
title
3
because
there
isn't
probable
cause,
and
there
seems
to
be
no
basis.
mr.
paul
m.
bator
in
the
case
of--
mr.
paul
m.
bator
--of
title
3?
mr.
paul
m.
bator
no,
your
honor.
no,
we
absolutely
concede
congress's
power
here
to
take
the
situation
over
and
to
determine
what
should
be
done
about
it.
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time.
mr.
paul
m.
bator
your
honor,
i
have
a
few
matters.
the
first
is
the...
try
to
throw
a
little
more
light
on
the
question
of
whether
there
is
a
title
3
case
here.
as
we
understand
it,
the
plaintiff
says
title
3
applies
here
because
this
is
not
a
national
security
wiretap.
we
think
that
on
this
record
this
court
should
find
on
its
own
that
this
can
only
be
characterized
as
a
national
security
tap.
mr.
paul
m.
bator
no,
your
honor,
we
think
the
district
court
did
find.
there
was
a
remand.
mr.
paul
m.
bator
if
there
was
a
remand
to
the
district
court
in
this
case,
your
honor,
about...
from
the
court
of
appeals
the
first
time
around
for
the
district
court
to
make
an
inquiry
into
the
purpose
of
this
wiretap,
the
reason
the
court
of
appeals
said
that
should
be
inquired
into
is
to
find
out
whether
the
purpose
of
the
wiretap
was
connected
with
prosecutorial
decisionmaking
which
would
give
attorney
general
mitchell
prosecutorial
absolute
immunity.
the
district
court--
mr.
paul
m.
bator
--can
i
get
to
that
in
just
a
second,
your
honor?
mr.
paul
m.
bator
the
district
court
inquired
into
the
question
whether
the
purpose
was
to
gather
evidence
for
prosecution
or
was
primarily
preventive.
now,
the
district
court
didn't
label
that
national
security.
the
district
court
said,
we
find
that
the
purpose
of
these
wiretaps
was
to
prevent
the
blowing
up
of
the
tunnel,
and
to
prevent
the
kidnapping
of
kissinger.
on
page
57a
the
court
says
the
purpose
of
the
wiretap
was
prevention,
not
prosecution.
now,
judge
van
ardsdel,
in
dealing
with
this
very
same
wiretap
in
the
companion
case,
the
burkhart
case,
had
to
make
the
same
inquiry
and
also
said,
whatever
may
be
the
proper
definition
of
a
national
security
wiretap,
both
the
davidon
and
the
black
panther
party
wiretaps
certainly
qualify
as
a
national
security
wiretap.
that
is
on
page
150a
of
the
appendix
to
the
petition.
now,
what
the
district
court
then
had
to
deal
with
was
the
assertion
that
even
though
on
the
objective
record
that
was
the
purpose
of
the
wiretap,
they
wanted
to
go
into
a
proceeding
in
which
attorney
general
mitchell
would
be
cross
examined
on
his
subjective
motivation,
that
he
himself
was
being
governed
by
a
malicious
purpose
of
political
retaliation.
now,
i
think
the
harlow
case
stands
for
the
proposition
that
a
mere
allegation
that
a
governmental
conduct
which
on
the
objective
record
has
substantial
support
as
a
legitimate
governmental
position,
that
you
cannot
in
connection
with
qualified
immunity
go
into
the
question
that
nevertheless
there
is
some
hidden
malicious
motive.
and
what
the
plaintiff
does
here,
your
honor,
i
think,
is
to
conjure
up
what
i
think
is
an
advantageous
and
irrelevant
under
harlow
allegation
that
even
though
the
objective
facts
are
as
the
district
court
found
them,
there
ought
to
be
a
further
inquiry
into
whether
those,
the
objective
justification
was
tainted
by
a
hidden
malicious
motive.
now,
that,
we
say,
was
excluded
by
harlow.
i
want
to
also
add
to
my
answer
to
justice
brennan
on
2520,
the
reason
i
fudged
on
that,
justice
brennan,
is
because
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
circuit,
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia,
did
hold
in
the
zweibaum
litigation,
which
is
the
jewish
defense
league
litigation,
that,
and
we
are
now
talking
about
pre-'78
wiretaps,
it
held
that
even
if
title
3
applies,
that
is,
even
if
keith
doesn't
take
national
security
wiretaps
out
from
title
3,
it
nevertheless
equitable
principles
would
compel
the
conclusion
that
qualified
immunity
should
be
read
into
the
title
3
case.
that
is
to
say
that
a
broader
defense
than
2520
ought
to
be
accorded
on
equitable
grounds
because
the
question
of
the
applicability
of
title
3
was
itself
so
highly
uncertain
and
so
conjectural.
so
it
was
really
a
fairness
problem.
