mr.
david
rudovsky
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
i
would
like
to
address
the
appealability
issue
first.
before
i
do,
i
do
want
to
correct
one
statement
with
respect
to
the
question
of
whether
this
in
fact,
and
it
is
a
threshold
question
that
has
never
been
decided
in
this
case,
as
to
whether
in
fact
this
was
a
national
security
tap,
and
whether
the
district
court
decided
that
it
was.
at
page
59a
of
the
record
appendix
to
the
petition
for
certiorari
in
the
district
court
opinion,
the
district
court
made
it
clear
that
it
was
leaving
open
that
question
when
it
said,
regardless
of
whether
the
davidon
wiretap
was
motivated
by
a
legitimate
national
security
concern
or
a
good
faith
belief
that
there
existed
a
national
security
concern
as
the
defendants
contend,
or
was
an
invasion
of
the
privacy
of
political
dissidence
conducted
under
the
guise
of
national
security
is
a
question
we
don't
have
to
reach.
the
district
court
merely
assumed
that
it
may
have
been
a
national
security
tap
to
reach
the
issue
of
qualified
immunity,
since
that
was
a
threshold
issue.
in
other
words,
there
has
been
no
determination
in
this
litigation
that
this
was
even--
mr.
david
rudovsky
--that's
correct.
the
matter
would
have
to
be
remanded
for
that
determination.
mr.
david
rudovsky
that's
correct,
and
it
also
leads
to
the
question
of
where
there
is
a
title
3
claim,
which
i
will
get
to
later
on
in
the
argument.
we
think
there
is
because
of
that
reason.
with
respect
to
appealability--
mr.
david
rudovsky
--yes,
there
is,
your
honor,
if
in
fact
we
are
correct
in
asserting
that
there
was
no
legitimate
national
security
predicate
for
this
tap.
in
fact,
i
don't
think
the
government
disputes
that
contention.
that
is
to
say,
if
this
was
a
normal
criminal
investigation,
and
the
tap
was
used
to
discover
criminal
activity
and
there
was
no
legitimate
national
security
concern,
then
you
have
a
violation
of
title
3,
which
was--
mr.
david
rudovsky
--keith
is
irrelevant,
there
is
a
damage
remedy,
and
there
is
no
qualified
immunity
or
absolute
immunity
available
under
2520.
that
is
an
important
issue
in
this
case.
mr.
david
rudovsky
no,
sir.
mr.
david
rudovsky
this
matter
was
appealed
before
the
district
court
could
enter
damages
in
this
case.
indeed,
there
are
no
further
proceedings
to
go
to
in
the
district
court.
let
me
address
that
matter,
because
it
relates
directly
to
appealability.
the
government's
theory
for
appealability
is
to
protect
a
defendant
from
the
rigors
of
trial,
from
the
distraction
of
trial,
from
the
expenses
of
trial.
in
this
case,
as
in
many
cases
in
which
a
qualified
immunity
defense
is
denied
on
purely
legal
grounds,
that
is,
there
is
no
factual
dispute,
summary
judgment
will
also
be
entered
for
the
plaintiff,
because
there
is
no
question
but
that
there
was
a
constitutional
right
violated.
the
only
question
is,
was
the
right
clearly
established.
here,
liability
is
clearly
in
favor
of
the
plaintiff,
as
the
district
court
held,
once
the
qualified
immunity
defense
is
rejected.
if
that
is
true
as
in
this
case,
there
are
no
further
proceedings
in
the
district
court
except
a
legal
determination
as
to
the
amount
of
damages
to
be
imposed.
that
is
the
rationale
for
the
rule
of
absolute
and
qualified
immunity
so
the
government
defendant
does
not
have
to
face
trail
evaporates
in
this
case
because
the
only
proceedings
left
in
the
district
court
was
a
legal
assessment
of
damages.
this
case
would
have
been
over
with
one
further
legal
argument,
and
then
you
would
have
had
final
judgment
and
all
the
issues
could
have
gone
up
on
appeal.
it
is
not
only
true
in
this
case,
but
as
i
just
stated,
it
will
be
true
in
a
wide
variety
of
qualified
immunity
cases.
once
qualified
immunity
is
denied
for
the
defendant,
even
erroneously,
summary
judgment
will
probably
be
entered
for
the
plaintiff.
liability
is
over.
there
is
no
more
trial.
there
is
no
more
discovery.
there
are
no
more
proceedings
that
the
defendant
is
subjected
to.
so,
the
entire
rationale
for
the
rule
evaporates,
and
there
is
no
reason
for
an
interlocutory
appeal.
more
fundamentally,
the
government's
position
with
respect
to
why
this
should
be
appealed
on
an
interlocutory
basis
is
twofold.
number
one,
they
say
that
harlow
cautioned
district
courts
to
terminate
insubstantial
suits
at
an
early
time.
the
government
says
that's
one
important
factor.
and
number
two,
they
say,
parsing
out
those
cases
in
which
there
is
a
factual
dispute,
where
there
is
only
a
legal
issue
involved,
a
district
court
and
an
appellate
court
only
has
to
apply
settled
legal
objective
standards
in
determining
whether
there
is
qualified
immunity.
that,
as
justice
stevens
suggested
in
a
question
to
the
government,
is
exactly
true
for
pretrial
motions,
dispositive
motions
filed
by
defendants
in
civil
cases,
motions
to
dismiss
based
on
failure
to
state
a
claim,
motions
for
lack
of
jurisdiction,
statutes
of
limitations
which
also
will
terminate
"insubstantial
suits
against
government
defendants".
that
is,
if
the
theory
is
that
the
government
defendant
is
entitled
to
termination
of
a
suit,
of
an
insubstantial
suit
at
an
early
stage,
the
rationale
for
allowing
appeals
from
qualified
immunity
would
have
to
be
extended
if
principally
done
to
virtually
every
pretrial
motion
that
a
government
official
can
make,
statute
of
limitations,
motions
to
dismiss,
improper
venue,
and
the
like.
there
is
no
principal
distinction
that
you
can
draw
between
the
reasons
that
those
motions
are
filed
to
terminate
insubstantial
suits
and
the
rationale
behind
qualified
immunity.
indeed,
it
is
most
anomalous
to
allow
the
government
to
appeal
a
qualified
immunity
denial
when
the
issue
clearly
is
substantial.
nobody
contends
that
mr.
forsythe's
rights
were
not
violated.
they
were
violated.
this
is
a
substantial
case
in
the
sense
that
his
fourth
amendment
rights
were
violated.
compare
that
to
a
12(b)(6)
motion
which
may
concern
a
totally
frivolous
claim.
if
the
motion
is
made
under
21(b)(6)
and
the
district
court
erroneously
denies
that
motion,
as
insubstantial
as
that
case
may
be,
and
as
easy
as
it
is
to
determine
that
it
is
insubstantial
by
applying
objective
legal
standards,
there
is
no
appeal.
the
official,
like
every
other
civil
litigant,
would
have
to
face
trial.
now,
to
be
sure,
a
district
court
can
certify
the
issue,
and
there
are
other
ways
that
the
matter
can
go
up,
but
the
fact
is
that
when
you
think
about
the
reason
behind
allowing
appeal,
at
least
the
reason
the
government
suggests
in
this
case,
it
would
have
to
apply
to
virtually
every
pretrial
issue,
and
would
seriously
distort
the
basic
structure,
the
basic
accommodation
of
responsibilities
between
district
courts
and
the
court
of
appeals
on
initial
pretrial
motions.
mr.
david
rudovsky
the
government
is
suggesting
that
where
there
is
an
insubstantial
claim
against
a
government
defendant,
then
in
order
to
protect
them
from
the
insubstantial
claim
at
trial,
they
ought
to
be
allowed
to
appeal
the
qualified
immunity
claim
pretrial,
but
that,
i
am
suggesting
to
the
court,
is
exactly
the
same
for
virtually
every
other
pretrial
motion,
including
a
motion
to
dismiss
which
this
court
has
clearly
held
for
over
50
years.
mr.
david
rudovsky
but
i
am
suggesting--
mr.
david
rudovsky
--i
am
suggesting
to
the
court
that
there
was
no
distinction
between
a
qualified
immunity
decision
by
a
district
court
in
that
regard,
if
the
theory
is
to
get
rid
of
insubstantial
suits,
and
all
the
other
issues
i
have
mentioned.
there
is
a
dramatic
difference
between
the
rationale
behind
absolute
immunity,
where
you
have
allowed
appeals,
speech
and
debate,
legislative
absolute
immunity,
prosecutorial
immunity,
and
qualified
immunity.
this
court
in
harlow,
while
cautioning
against
letting
insubstantial
claims
go
to
trial,
on
the
other
hand
made
it
very
clear
that
where
the
claim
is
substantial,
the
claim
must
go
to
trial,
so
that
if
there
is
a
substantial
claim,
it
goes
to
trial.
by
contrast,
absolute
immunity,
no
matter
how
substantial
the
claim,
forecloses
suit
because
of
the
status
and
the
function
of
the
particular
defendant.
you
don't
even
look
at
the
question
of
substantiality.
it
could
be
the
most
substantial
suit
in
the
world
with
respect
to
a
violation
of
constitutional
rights.
mr.
david
rudovsky
right.
in
that
case
clearly
because
there
is
absolute
immunity,
because
of
the
function
of
the
legislator
in
that
act,
no
suit
can
be
brought
and
no
trial
can
be
had
even
if
the
underlying
action
against
that
legislator
would
state
a
violation
of
a
constitutional
right.
by
contrast,
qualified
immunity
is
only
a
qualified
protection,
and
this
court
in
harlow
made
it
clear
that
substantial
suits
should
go
to
trial.
it
is
not
a
question
of
the
status
or
function
solely
of
the
defendant.
it
is
a
question
of
whether
the
law
was
clearly
established.
harlow
provided
government
defendants
with
a
substantial
added
protection.
it
put
on
the
same
footing
qualified
immunity
as
a
pretrial
issue
as
opposed
to
a
trial
issue,
which
it
was
before
harlow.
by
doing
that,
this
court
surely
did
not
intend
that
it
should
be
distinguished
from
all
other
pretrial
dispositive
motions
which
have
to
await
final
judgment
before
they
can
be
appealed.
now,
there
is
a
serious
question
if
you
allowed
appealability
in
this
case
of
the
number
of
appeals
that
you
would
soon
face
in
this
area.
one
of
the
criteria
under
cone
for
allowing
an
interlocutory
appeal
is
that
it
only
create
a
small
class
of
cases.
well,
it
is
now
boilerplate
language
in
virtually
every
answer
to
a
complaint
to
a
civil
rights
action,
whether
it
be
under
bivens
or
1983
that
the
defendant
is
clothed
with
qualified
immunity.
the
government
seeks
to
avoid
the
impact
that
these
cases
would
have
on
the
courts
of
appeals
by
suggesting,
well,
we
are
only
saying
that
where
there
is
only
a
legal
issue
as
opposed
to
factual
disputes,
those
cases
should
go
up.
well,
we
suggest
that
determination
is
not
always
very
easy
to
make,
that
is,
whether
there
is
a
factual
dispute
involved
in
the
case.
this
case
is
one
example,
because
there
is
a
dispute
about
whether
in
fact
there
was
a
national
security
predicate.
if
you
look
carefully
at
the
kenyata
decision
in
the
fifth
circuit...
that
was
the
case
in
which
the
fifth
circuit
ruled
that
these
cases
were
not
appealable...
in
that
case
the
fifth
circuit
not
only
ruled
that
the
appeal
should
not
be
allowed
on
an
interlocutory
basis,
but
because
a
critical
issue
in
that
case
was
whether
the
defendants
acted
with
racial
animus
was
a
fourteenth
amendment
claim,
the
court
of
appeals
specifically
said
in
its
opinion
unanimously
there
is
a
factual
dispute
which
would
bar
an
appeal
even
if
we
allowed
appeals
generally
in
these
cases.
the
government--
mr.
david
rudovsky
--yes.
mr.
david
rudovsky
there
is
an
enormous
amount
of
information
in
the
record
with
respect
to
the
purpose.
let
me
point
just
to
a
couple
of
factors
from
our
side
which
would
create
at
least
a
factual
dispute
on
that
point.
number
one,
it
is
clear
that
while
this
case
was
being
investigated,
and
it
eventually
led
to
criminal
indictment,
a
justice
attorney,
a
department
of
justice
attorney
who
was
in
charge
of
the
investigation
suggested
that
there
be
a
title
3
tap
installed,
that
is
that
the
government
go
to
a
court
and
get
a
warrant.
when
you
look
at
the
underlying
papers
that
were
sent
by
fbi
director
hoover
to
attorney
general
mitchell
requesting
the
tap,
what
you
find
in
a
lot
of
those
papers
are
questions
about
legitimate
political
activity.
furthermore,
and
this
is
essential
both
to
that
point
and
to
the
question
of
title
3,
the
question
of
whether
there
is
a
national
security
basis
or
not
has
to
be
measured
against
the
language
in
title
3
which
requires
at
that
point
that
the
government
was
going
to
claim
a
national
security
predicate,
that
they
show
that
there
was
a
plot
to
overthrow
the
government
or
that
there
was
a
clear
and
present
danger
to
the
existence
of
government.
now,
there
is
no
possible
evidence
here
of
a
plot
to
overthrow
the
government,
and
the
government
doesn't
make
that
claim,
nor
is
there
any
evidence
of
a
clear
and
present
danger
to
government
because
the
government
was
well
informed
of
everything
the
so-called
conspirators
were
planning
to
do
by
an
informant.
they
knew
that
if
anything
was
going
to
happen,
it
was
not
going
to
happen
until
six
months
after
they
got
their
information.
they
had
the
power
of
indictment
to
prevent
any
action,
and
in
fact
three
months
before
any
plans
were
supposed
to
come
to
fruition,
director
hoover,
in
testimony
before
congress
told
the
nation
and
it
was
over
the
front
pages
of
all
the
newspapers
that
we
have
uncovered
this
supposed
scheme
to
blow
up
underground
heating
tunnels
and
to
kidnap
dr.
henry
kissinger.
in
other
words,
there
was
under
the
statutory
language,
and
this
is
the
point
of
justice
white's
concurrence
in
keith,
no
evidence
of
a
clear
and
present
danger.
all
of
that
certainly
creates
at
a
minimum
a
factual
dispute
as
to
whether
this
was
a
legitimate
national
security
tap
or
whether
it
was
done
under
the
guise
of
national
security
to
further
a
criminal
investigation
or
just
obtain
information
about
political
dissidents.
so,
we
suggest
when
you
look
at
this
record,
and
we
have
tried
to
spell
it
out
in
our
brief
in
brief,
there
are
substantial
facts
that
make
this
a
contested
issue.
the
government's
claim...
i
want
to
go
back
to
the
kenyata
matter,
because
there
the
government,
after
the
court
of
appeals
said
clearly
there
is
a
factual
dispute,
the
government
then
petitioned
for
rehearing.
the
fifth
circuit
has
denied
that
petition
for
rehearing,
and
the
government
has
now
asked
time
to
petition
for
certiorari.
regardless
of
who
is
right
in
kenyata,
whether
the
government
is
right
as
to
whether
there
is
no
factual
dispute,
or
whether
the
fifth
circuit
is
right
as
to
whether
there
is
a
factual
dispute,
that
demonstrates
clearly
that
it
is
not
very
easy
even
after
a
full
review
of
the
record
by
a
court
of
appeals
to
determine
which
issues
are
in
dispute
factually
and
which
are
not,
and
if
this
court
signals
by
allowing
every
qualified
immunity
claim
to
be
appealed
on
an
interlocutory
basis
to
civil
defendants
in
these
case
that
they
can
delay
trial,
and
this
case
has
now
been
delayed
six
years
because
of
interlocutory
appeals,
by
merely
filing
an
appeal
from
the
denial
of
the
claim
and
then
having
the
court
of
appeals
review
the
entire
record,
hear
briefs
and
arguments,
you
are
going
to
create
an
enormous
load
on
the
courts
of
appeals.
the
third
circuit
recognized
that,
the
fifth
circuit
recognized
that,
and
in
a
very
important
decision
recently
from
the
seventh
circuit,
powers
versus
leitner,
which
is
cited
in
the
government's
reply
brief
that
came
down
january
16th,
that
court
also
explicates
the
reasons
behind
not
allowing
an
interlocutory
appeal
in
this
area.
my
final
point
as
to
why
the
cone
doctrine
simply
is
not
compatible
with
the
claim
for
interlocutory--
mr.
david
rudovsky
--and
in
this
case
the
plaintiff
has
already
won.
this
case
was
about
to
go
to
a
hearing
on
damages
one
month
after
decision.
there
would
have
been
a
short
argument.
damages
would
have
been
assessed
either
in
nominal
damages
or
damages
directly
under
the
constitution,
and
the
case
would
have
gone
to
the
court
of
appeals,
and
indeed,
if
harlow
was
in
effect--
mr.
david
rudovsky
--no,
because
a
lot
of
cases
beyond
the
qualified
immunity
decision
may
get
settled.
there
may
not
be
appeal
at
the
end
of
that
case.
there
are
a
lot
of
reasons
that
cases
go
eventually
to
trial,
and
defendants
don't
take
appeals.
the
fact
is
that
some
cases
that
would
otherwise
go
to
the
court
of
appeals
would
not
if
you
don't
allow
an
interlocutory
appeal.
mr.
david
rudovsky
we
do
only
if
we
eventually
lose
our
claim
under
the
constitution
or
bivens.
that
is,
the
damage
assessment
would
probably
be
the
same
whether
it
is
under
the
constitution
or
the
bivens
claim
or
the
statutory
claim.
mr.
david
rudovsky
no,
what
there
is
in
the
record
is
a
stipulation
submitted
by
the
plaintiff
that
he
did
not
suffer
any
pecuniary
loss
in
this
case.
our
position
on
damages
would
be
either
title
3
damages,
which
is
$1,000
or
$100
a
day,
and
in
this
case
it
would
be
$1,000
because
there
are
only
three
days
of
overhearings,
or
damages
directly
under
the
constitution,
the
issue
left
open
in
kerry
versus
pipus,
if
a
substantive
constitutional
protection
is
violated,
whether
we
are
entitled
to
an
award
of
damages
for
the
violation
of
a
constitutional
right
itself.
the
suggestion
about
nominal
damages
was
that
since
there
was
only...
there
is
no
pecuniary
loss
here,
that
is
one
option.
mr.
david
rudovsky
to
take
it
further...
that
is
correct.
we
don't
know
under
title
3--
mr.
david
rudovsky
--i
have
no
disagreement
with
that,
justice
white.
mr.
david
rudovsky
well,
the
standard
that
you
would
apply
is
certainly
questionable
whether
it
is
primary
purpose
or
whether
it
has
to
be
phony.
mr.
david
rudovsky
but
putting
that
aside--
mr.
david
rudovsky
--your
honor,
we
urged
the
district
court
throughout
this
case
to
at
least
decide
at
the
same
time
the
title
3
claim.
it
chose
not
to,
perhaps
because
the
court
in
keith
reached
the
constitutional
issue
without
addressing
your
concerns
about
the
statute.
mr.
david
rudovsky
i
am
not
suggesting
that
you
should.
that
is
how
this
case
came
up.
in
fact,
i
pointed
out
in
my
opposing
brief
on
certiorari
and
in
my
brief
here
that
to
find
no
national
security
predicate
moots
all
these
issues.
it
moots
appealability,
it
moots
absolute
immunity,
and
it
moots
qualified
immunity.
it
is
a
straightforward
application.
but
the
case
is
here
at
this
point
on
those
issues.
my
final
point
on
appealability
is--
mr.
david
rudovsky
--i'm
sorry.
mr.
david
rudovsky
yes,
sir.
mr.
david
rudovsky
it
certainly,
as
this
court
has
cautioned
district
courts
to
decide
the
statutory
issue
first--
mr.
david
rudovsky
--your
honor,
we
did
urge
both
points
before
the
district
court.
we
did
not
urge
the
district
court
just
to
decide
the
constitutional
issue.
we
urged
both
the
statutory
claim
and
the
constitutional
issue.
we
certainly
did
not
say
avoid
the
statutory
claim.
that
is
a
major
claim
we
would
have
in
this
case.
my
final
point
on
appealability
is
a
critical
question
under
the
cone
doctrine.
cone
says
you
may
not
allow
interlocutory
appeals
if
the
issue
to
be
appealed
is
intertwined
with
the
facts
or
the
law
of
the
case.
that
is,
it
has
to
be
completely
collateral
to
the
merits
of
the
case.
when
you
analyze
a
qualified
immunity
claim,
it
is
easy
to
see
that
the
issue
on
qualified
immunity
involves
an
analysis
similar
to
the
issue
of
whether
a
right
was
violated
in
the
first
place,
that
is,
the
merits
of
the
claim.
you
have
to
see
what
right
is
claimed
by
the
plaintiff,
what
acts
are
alleged
by
the
plaintiff
that
may
result
in
a
violation
of
that
right,
and
then
examine
the
history
of
that
right
in
the
courts
to
determine
whether
the
law
was
clearly
established.
if
that
is
the
analysis
to
be
filed
in
determining
a
qualified
immunity
claim,
that
is
inextricably
intertwined
with
the
decision
on
the
merits.
mr.
david
rudovsky
there
is
certainly
nothing
wrong
with
that,
justice
o'connor.
mr.
david
rudovsky
but
when
you
do
that
and
you
determine
what
the
status
of
the
law
was
at
the
time
of
the
violation,
that
is
the
same
kind
of
analysis,
we
suggest,
on
the
merits,
and
i
will
get
to
the
merits
in
a
minute,
in
determining
whether
there
was
a
violation
at
all,
so
that
regardless
of
whether
that
is
an
easy
task
or
not
an
easy
task...
that
is
not
my
point.
my
point
is--
mr.
david
rudovsky
--we
have
a
much
different
approach,
obviously,
than
the
government
does
on
that
question.
i
will
turn
to
that
now
to
demonstrate
both
the
intertwining
of
these
issues
and
the
merits.
our
position
in
the
district
court
in
this
litigation
on
the
question
of
whether
this
law
was
clearly
established
rested
on
perhaps
the
most
cardinal
principle
in
our
constitutional
system,
that
is,
a
principle
repeatedly
announced
by
this
court
in
case
after
case
that
all
searches
and
seizures
conducted
without
a
warrant
are
per
se
unconstitutional
unless
subject
to
an
already
articulated
exception.
these
exceptions,
this
court
has
warned,
are
jealously
guarded
and
specifically
limited.
in
1968
and
1970,
when
this
case
was
decided,
there
was
no
articulated
exception
for
national
security
searches.
mr.
david
rudovsky
keith
said
that,
yes.
this
court
in
keith
also
said
that
we
reject
the
government's
request
for
a
new
exception
to
the
fourth
amendment.
our
position
is
straightforward.
where
a
particular
constitutional
provision
has
been
construed
for
the
long
period
that
the
fourth
amendment
has,
and
this
court
has
announced
over
and
over
again
that
it
is
the
"point"
of
the
fourth
amendment
to
prohibit
searches
without
warrants
and
they
are
per
se
illegal.
until
there
is
a
recognized
exception,
a
government
official
violates
established
law
when
he
takes
risks
with
an
individual's
rights
are
trying
to
create
an
exception
through
conduct
that
was
clearly
illegal.
there
was
no
basis
by
any
court
decision
to
indicate
that
there
was
an
established
exception
to
fourth
amendment
jurisprudence
allowing
searches
without
warrants
based
on
national
security
concerns.
indeed,
what
if
the
attorney
general
in
1970
had
decided
based
on
national
security,
the
same
kinds
of
concerns
he
had
here,
that
he
could
break
into
people's
houses,
seize
their
papers,
or
arrest
"subversives"
without
probable
cause?
certainly
there
was
nothing
to
support
such
an
action
in
1970,
and
we
suggest
there
is
no
principal
distinction
between
that
kind
of
action
and
wiretapping,
which
is
an
even
more
intrusive
invasion
of
privacy.
the
attorney
general
also
knew
in
1970
that
this
court
over
150
years
had
rejected
the
mere
incantatio
of
national
security
as
an
exception
to
constitutional
limitations.
you
had
done
it
in
the
steel
seizure
case
where
you
rejected
inherent
executive
power.
you
had
done
it
in
the
first
amendment
cases
in
robell.
you
had
done
it
across
the
board
in
rejecting
government
claims
that
merely
because
national
security
was
involved,
somehow
a
government
official
did
not
have
to
follow
and
was
not
restricted
by
the
constitution.
our
point
again
is
straightforward.
there
was
no
exception.
the
attorney
general
was
trying
to
create
an
entirely
new
exception
to
the
fourth
amendment.
there
was
no
basis
for
that.
and
indeed,
when
the
government
argues
that
presidents
had
followed
this
procedure
for
some
25
years
or
perhaps
longer,
they
don't
say
at
this
point
that
in
fact
most
of
those
orders
were
based
with
respect
to
foreign
intelligence
taps,
and
there
is
a
complete
distinction
between
foreign
intelligence
and
domestic
national
security,
which
is
this
case,
nor
do
they
point
out
that
for
25
years
executive
officials
tried
to
get
congress
to
authorize
these
kinds
of
taps
without
a
warrant,
and
congress
repeatedly,
as
we
point
out
in
our
brief,
for
25
years
rejected
every
request
by
the
executive
for
the
power
to
tap
without
a
warrant
in
national
security
areas.
indeed,
the
law
was
so
clear
in
1970
that
the
solicitor
general
advised
the
attorney
generala
that
any
claim
to
exemption
from
the
fourth
amendment
for
national
security
wiretaps
would
face
a
disaster
in
the
supreme
court.
there
was
no
basis
for
such
a
claim,
and
therefore
it
should
not
be
made.
if
i
may
in
my
time
remaining,
i
do
want
to
address
the
claim
to
absolute
immunity
which
we
think
should
be
emphatically
rejected
by
this
court.
number
one,
the
government
simply
does
not
address
the
strongest
reason
there
is
for
rejecting
absolute
immunity.
you
have
been
informed
that
in
1978
congress
repealed
section
2511.3
of
title
3,
which
was
their
only
claim
at
the
time
keith
was
decided
against
liability
for
national
security
taps
without
a
warrant.
congress
by
section
2520
and
by
its
action
in
1978
abolished
any
claim
to
absolute
immunity
for
a
government
official
who
wiretaps
without
a
warrant
and
seriously
restricted
any
qualified
immunity
or
good
faith
claim.
the
government's
claim
for
absolute
immunity
is
that
a
government
official
should
not
face
trial,
should
not
even
have
to
fear
a
complaint
or
trial
if
he
acts
without
a
warrant
in
the
national
security
area.
congress
has
said
you
must
face
trial,
you
must
pay
damages.
if
the
attorney
general
tomorrow
instituted
a
national
security
tap
without
a
warrant,
he
would
have
to
face
trial
under
title
3,
under
section
2520,
and
if
the
facts
were
true,
he
would
have
to
pay
damages
for
that.
so,
the
reason,
the
rationale
suggested
by
the
government
for
giving
him
absolute
immunity
completely
fades
away.
he
would
have
to
face
trial
anyway
on
the
title
3
claim.
how
can
they
say
that
granting
him
absolute
immunity
on
the
bivens
claim
protects
him
in
any
way?
they
simply
don't
come
to
terms
with
our
argument
in
our
brief
on
that
point.
they
push
it
off
in
a
footnote
in
theirs,
but
they
don't
answer
it.
nor
is
there
a
suggestion
that
the
1978
repeal
was
not
retroactive
meaningful
at
all.
it
is
not
a
question
of
retroactivity.
there
is
nothing
in
this
record
that
john
mitchell,
when
he
instituted
this
tap,
relied
on
established
law
of
absolute
immunity.
it
is
not
a
question
of
absolute
immunity.
it
is
a
question
of
policy
which
this
court
says
congress
has
plenary
authority
over
in
determining
the
scope
of
immunities.
congress
has
said
as
a
matter
of
policy
when
a
government
official
wiretaps
without
a
warrant,
no
matter
who
that
official
is,
probably
with
the
exception
of
the
president,
given
nixon
and
fitzgerald,
everybody
else
is
liable
in
damages.
he
must
face
trial.
given
that,
what
claim
can
there
possibly
be
for
absolute
immunity
from
the
constitutional
claim?
he
has
to
face
trial
anyway.
even
if
that
wasn't
true,
even
if
congress
had
not
made
this
decision,
this
court
has
made
quite
clear
that
before
a
government
official
can
be
granted
absolute
immunity,
he
must
show
that
the
specific
function
for
which
he
claims
absolute
immunity
is
so
sensitive
as
to
require
the
granting
of
absolute
immunity.
that
is
to
say,
you
cannot
make
an
undifferentiated
claim
to
absolute
immunity,
as
the
government
has,
by
saying
all
national
security
decisions
ought
to
be
subject
to
absolute
immunity.
the
specific
function
in
this
case
is
wiretapping
without
a
warrant.
their
claim
for
absolute
immunity
is
that
we
ought
to
be
able
to
act
in
the
national
security
area
without
overlooking
by
the
courts.
it
is
totally
within
our
authority.
keith
rejected
that
rationale
absolutely.
the
point
of
keith
was
that
you
cannot
electronically
surveil
somebody
without
getting
a
court's
prior
authorization.
if
that
is
true,
their
claim
for
absolute
immunity
on
policy
grounds
is
totally
defeated,
because
that
is
the
only
thing
they
can
assert
in
this
court.
indeed,
when
you
look
at
the
definition
of
national
security
that
attorney
general
mitchell
was
operating
under
in
1970,
it
points
up
again
the
danger,
the
literal
danger
of
this
broad
and
bold
claim
that
the
government
makes
to
this
court.
in
1970,
according
to
attorney
general
mitchell,
who
testified
in
this
case,
national
security
interests
were
defined,
as
he
said,
as
those
interests
which
protect
the
national
security,
and
they
would
range
over
very,
very
wide
areas.
he
can't
even
define
national
security,
and
when
he
was
asked
in
that
deposition,
well,
were
there
any
guidelines,
he
said
there
were
no
other
guidelines
for
me
to
follow.
it
was
my
determination...
indeed,
he
didn't
even
follow
the
guidelines
in
2511.3,
which
restricted
it
to
overthrow
the
government
or
clear
and
present
danger.
the
government
would
have
this
court
grant
the
attorney
general
absolute
immunity
on
the
mere
incantation
of
a
claim
that
national
security
was
involved.
that
would
go
against
the
entire
thrust
of
every
one
of
this
court's
opinions
on
absolute
immunity
which
insist
on
a
specific
functional
analysis,
that
is,
an
analysis
that
is
tied
directly
and
completely
to
the
claim
that
is
involved.
we
suggest
that
the
claim
to
absolute
immunity
simply
is
frivolous
in
this
case
given
what
congress
has
already
decided,
and
that
this
court
should
reject
it
emphatically.
