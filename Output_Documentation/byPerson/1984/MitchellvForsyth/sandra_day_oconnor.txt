justice
o'connor
well,
mr.
bator,
even
if
you
are
100
percent
correct
on
the
qualified
immunity
question,
what
about
the
review
of
that
at
this
stage,
the
appealability
question,
which
seems
to
me
to
be
a
tougher
question
than
the
one
on
the
merits?
justice
o'connor
well,
was
there
some
factual
dispute
here
about
whether
the
wiretap
was
motivated
by
national
security
concerns,
so
is
it
enmeshed
in
the
merits,
and
so
forth?
justice
o'connor
mr.
rudovsky--
justice
o'connor
--does
the
record
have
anything
in
it
that
would
really
establish
a
dispute
about
the
purpose?
what
is
in
the
record
factually?
justice
o'connor
well,
i
suppose
a
court
in
considering
it
would
just
assume
that
the
allegations
of
the
complaint
are
true
and
then
look
at
the
law.
what
is
the
matter
with
that?
justice
o'connor
well,
that
is
what
the
government
says
ought
to
be
done
here.
justice
o'connor
in
this
case,
it
looks
like
a
pretty
easy
task
on
the
law,
because
it
wasn't
clearly
established.
justice
o'connor
didn't
keith
itself
subsequently
say
that
was
an
undecided
question
and
had
been?
