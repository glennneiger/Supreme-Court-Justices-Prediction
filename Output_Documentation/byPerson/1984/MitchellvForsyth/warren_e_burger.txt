we
will
hear
arguments
next
in
mitchell
against
forsyth.
mr.
bator.
chief
justice
burger
were
those
conversations
the
target
at
their
inception?
chief
justice
burger
does
it
not
go
back
even
more
than
that?
chief
justice
burger
one
case,
i
thought,
in
either
this
court
or
the
court
of
appeals
referred
to
a
memorandum
from
franklin
roosevelt
to
the
attorney
general
jackson.
chief
justice
burger
is
it
not
equally
true
of
the
absolute
immunity,
for
example,
that
the
judiciary
has--
chief
justice
burger
--that
they
are
to
be
relieved
of
the
expense
and
the
annoyance
and
distress
of
defending
a
lawsuit
so
that
they
can
carry
on
their
judicial
duties?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
mr.
rudovsky.
chief
justice
burger
in
what
kinds
of
cases
are
you
addressing
that,
all
lawsuits
or
lawsuits
where
there
is
an
immunity
question
lurking?
chief
justice
burger
does
the
government...
at
least
i
took
it
that
the
government's
argument
on
that
point
was
limited
to
cases
where
there
is
an
immunity
question.
chief
justice
burger
not
just
to
any
lawsuit.
chief
justice
burger
translate
that
for
me
if
you
will,
counsel,
in
a
speech
or
debate
clause
in
a
hypothetical
case
where
a
senator
has
made
a
speech
on
the
floor
of
the
house,
so
there
is
no
question
about
it,
and
then
suit
is
brought.
now,
apply
these
principles
to
that.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
have
anything
further,
mr.
bator?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
