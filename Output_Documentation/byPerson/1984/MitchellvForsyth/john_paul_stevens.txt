justice
stevens
let
me
ask
you
one
other
question,
because
i
have
been
puzzled
by
the
extent
to
which
title
3
is
relevant.
is
it
clear
that
the
only
liability
that
the
district
court
was
talking
about
was
liability
under
a
bivens
type
claim?
justice
stevens
and
everybody
agrees
with
that?
justice
stevens
there
are
some
traces
in
your
opponent's
brief
that
i
didn't
read
that
way.
justice
stevens
that
there
is
any
title
3
issue
at
all.
justice
stevens
doesn't
that
argument
prove
too
much?
doesn't
every
motion
to
dismiss
or
motion
for
summary
judgment
have
that
very
purpose?
justice
stevens
it
could
be
made
for
a
lot
of
statute
of
limitations
defenses.
a
lot
of
times
you
like
to
plan
things
without
worrying
about
contingent
liability.
justice
stevens
do
you
just
make
this
argument
when
there
are
no
disputes
on
the
facts?
you
can
have,
i
suppose,
disputed
fact
questions
on
a
qualified
immunity
case.
justice
stevens
would
that
absolute
immunity
submission
on
the
government's
part
encompass
a
violation
of
title
3,
do
you
suppose?
or
are
we
still
just
talking
about
bivens
claims?
does
your
submission
pertaining
to
absolute
immunity
go
so
far
as
to
claim
absolute
immunity
for
a
statutory
violation?
justice
stevens
before
you
leave
the
title
3,
you
say
this
is
a
title
3
case?
justice
stevens
but
i
am
still
puzzled,
because
i
was
under
the
impression
that
the
district
court
had
entered
a
judgment
finding
a
dollar
of
nominal
damages.
justice
stevens
was
i
wrong?
justice
stevens
where
did
i
get...
maybe
i
just
read
something.
wasn't
there
something
in
the
papers
that
said
he
did
enter
a
judgment
for
a
dollar
nominal
damages?
justice
stevens
the
thing
that
troubles
me...
justice
brennan
adverted
to
it
earlier.
it
seems
to
me
that
conceivably
the
analysis
of
the
whole
case
might
be
different
depending
on
whether
it
is
a
statutory
case
or
a
constitutional
case,
and
we
don't
have
a
finding.
you
have
told
us,
although
your
opponent
said
otherwise,
you
say
there
is
no
finding
yet
on
the
national
security
issue,
so
we
don't
know
which
it
is.
justice
stevens
but
on
that,
mr.
bator,
then
do
you
agree
with
your
opponent
that
the
district
court
did
not
find--
justice
stevens
--what
do
you
do
with
the
bottom
of
page
59a
then?
justice
stevens
even
if
it
was
a
political
pretext?
justice
stevens
i
am
sorry.
yes.
