justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
you
say
it
doesn't
imply
or
suggest
review
of
army
policy.
certainly
your
paragraphs
40
and
41
on
page
14
of
the
joint
appendix
require
the
district
court
to
review
some
army
personnel
decisions.
justice
rehnquist
yes,
but
i
thought
part
of
the
feres
doctrine
was
that
you
do
not
subject
the
armed
forces
to
the
same
sort
of
review
of
their
policies
and
actions
as
you
do
subject
private
companies.
justice
rehnquist
you
may
have
answered
this
question
before,
and
i
missed
it.
what
if
this
fellow
had
gone
on
the
rampage
in
the
bar
somewhere
near
the
base
and
shot
six
people,
all
civilians.
