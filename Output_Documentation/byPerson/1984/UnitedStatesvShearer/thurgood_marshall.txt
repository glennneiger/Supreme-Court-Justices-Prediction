if
the
soldier
had
been
dismissed
from
the
army
a
day
before
this,
there
would
be
no
case.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
hate
to
see
it
out
that
far,
because
what
would
happen
if
it
was
a
year
later?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
have
a
little
trouble
with
one
statement.
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
the
army
exposed
him
to
this.
they
were
off
the
base,
weren't
they?
justice
thurgood
marshall
why
did
the
army
expose
him
to
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
how
could
they
control
him
off
base?
justice
thurgood

by
shooting
him?
justice
thurgood
marshall
by
shooting
him?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
you
said
eliminate.
justice
thurgood
marshall
suppose
they
released
him,
to
use
your
phrase,
the
day
before
he
committed
this
murder,
would
the
army
be
liable?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
what
about
if
he
broke
into
the
bar
and
robbed
the
bar
and
then
shot
the
bartender?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
what
in
the
history
showed
that
he
was
likely
to
rob
a
bar?
justice
thurgood
marshall
don't
open
the
gate
too
far.
justice
thurgood
marshall
you've
got
it
about
as
wide
open
as
you
can
get
it.
