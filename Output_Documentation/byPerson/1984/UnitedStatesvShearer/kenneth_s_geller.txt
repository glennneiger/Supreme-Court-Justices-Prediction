mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
arises
out
of
a
rather
unfortunate
incident
that
occurred
in
new
mexico
in
1979.
andrew
heard,
who
was
a
soldier
in
the
united
states
army
stationed
at
fort
bliss,
texas,
murdered
vernon
shearer,
who
was
also
a
soldier
stationed
at
fort
bliss,
when
both
men
were
off
base
and
off
duty.
and
heard
was
later
sentenced
to
15
to
55
years
in
prison
in
the
state
court
for
second
degree
murder.
now,
thereafter,
shearer's
mother,
who
is
the
respondent
in
this
court,
sued
the
united
states
under
the
federal
tort
claims
act
seeking
damages
for
her
son's
death.
respondent
alleged
that
heard
had
certain
well-known
dangerous
propensities,
and
that
the
army's
negligent
failure
to
control
him,
or
to
discharge
him
from
the
military,
or
to
warn
other
soldiers
about
him
was
the
cause
of
shearer's
death.
the
government
moved
for
summary
judgment
on
the
basis
of
two
exceptions
to
the
tort
claims
act.
one
is
the
intentional
tort
exception
in
section
2680(h)
of
title
viii,
and
the
other
is
the
feres
doctrine.
the
district
court
granted
the
government's
motion
for
summary
judgment,
but
a
divided
court
of
appeals
reversed.
the
third
circuit
held
that
respondent's
suit
was
not
barred
by
the
intentional
tort
exception
because
her
complaint
was
framed
in
terms
of
negligence,
and
the
court
held
that
it
was
not
barred
by
the
feres
doctrine
because
shearer's
injuries
had
not
occurred,
in
the
court's
view,
incident
to
his
military
service.
now,
we
sought
certiorari
because
we
believe
that
these
rulings
are
plainly
erroneous
and
conflict
with
numerous
other
decisions
construing
the
tort
claims
act.
now,
i'd
like
to
begin
by
discussing
the
intentional
tort
exception
first,
because
we
believe
that
the
plain
language
of
that
provision
on
its
face
unquestionably
disposes
of
respondent's
claim.
the
tort
claims
act
by
its
terms
does
not
apply
to
any
claim
"arising
out
of
certain
intentional
torts,
including
assault
and
battery.
"
now,
there
can't
really
be
much
doubt,
we
believe,
that
respondent's
claim
here
clearly
arises
out
of
heard's
assault
and
battery
within
the
ordinary
meaning
of
that
phrase.
heard's
assault
and
battery
directly
gave
rise
to
the
injuries
suffered
by
respondent.
respondent
unquestionably
would
have
no
cause
of
action
if
it
wasn't
for
heard's
assault
and
battery.
and
the
damages
that
she
seeks
here
are
precisely
those
damages
that
arose
from
the
assault
and
battery,
no
more
and
no
less.
her
claim,
therefore,
we
believe
falls
within
the
literal
language
of
the
intentional
tort
exception.
now,
the
court
of
appeals
attempted
to
avoid
the
straightforward
language
of
section
2680(h)
by
pointing
out
that
respondent's
claim
is
drafted
in
terms
of
negligence
rather
than
directly
charging
the
government
with
assault
and
battery.
it
is
undoubtedly
true
that
respondent,
with
an
eye
on
section
2680(h),
has
framed
her
complaint
here
to
charge
negligence
rather
than
directly
charge
assault
and
battery;
but
we
believe
that
a
plaintiff's
drafting
decision
plainly
can't
control
the
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity
that
congress
has
placed
in
the
tort
claims
act.
it
is
a
crucial--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--well,
i
think
one
could
read
section
2680(h)
even
to
cover
that
situation,
but
we
have
not
suggested
that.
there's
a
line
of
cases
that--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--yes.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
well,
but--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--i
think
the
distinction
is
not
difficult,
justice
stevens,
because
section
2680(h)
bars
claims
against
the
united
states
arising
out
of
assault
and
battery.
and
what
we
think
congress
was
obviously
focusing
on
was
arising
out
of
assault
and
battery
by
a
federal
employee.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
if
it
was
a
federal
employee,
we
think
it
would
be
covered
by
section
2680(h).
there's
a
line
of
cases,
however,
where
one
inmate
assaults
another
inmate,
and
we
have
not
contended
that
that
would
be
covered
by
section
2680(h).
i
think
the
distinction
is
one
that
justice
harlan
when
he
was
a
member
of
the
second
circuit
drew,
and
we
think
quite
reasonably
so,
in
the
panella
case;
and
that
is
something
that
has
been
followed
by
many
of
the
subsequent
courts.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
yes.
we
think
the
whole
tort
claims
act
is
only
talking
about
what
should
flow
from
torts
by
federal
employees,
what
consequences
should
flow
from
torts
by
federal
employees.
and
therefore,
we
think
section
2680(h)
should
be
read
at
a
minimum
to
bar
suits
against
the
united
states
arising
out
of
assaults
and
batteries
by
federal
employees,
and
therefore,
the
court
in
this
case
needn't
address
what
the
situation
would
be
if
the
assault
was
by
a
non-employee.
now,
as
i
was
saying,
the
crucial
language
of
the
tort
claims
act
says
not
that
the
united
states
cannot
be
sued
for
assault
and
battery;
it
says
the
united
states
cannot
be
sued
for
any
claim
arising
out
of
assault
and
battery.
and
congress
presumably
chose
this
broader
language
for
a
reason.
we
think
the
reason
was
that
it
wanted
to
avoid
the
federal
treasury's
having
to
pay
any
claim
that
requires
proof
of
an
intentional
tort
by
a
federal
employee.
in
fact,
negligence
supervision
claims
such
as
the
one
that
respondent
has
tried
to
bring
here
would
seem
to
be
precisely
the
sort
of
claim
that
arises
out
of
an
assault
and
battery
but
perhaps
does
not
fall
within
wording
such
as
for
assault
and
battery.
so
we
think
that
unless
congress'
choice
of
language...
and
it
was
a
deliberate
choice
of
language...
is
to
be
accorded
no
significance,
then
section
2680(h)
has
to
be
read
to
cover
claims
like
respondent's
that
sound
in
torts
other
than
assault
and
battery
but
plainly
arise
out
of
assault
and
battery.
and
if
there
were
any
real
doubt
that
this
was
the
correct
interpretation
of
the
exemptions
to
the
tort
claims
act,
i
think
it
was
dispelled
by
the
court's
decision
last
term
in
the
kosak
case.
now,
the
court
will
recall
that
kosak
involved
a
parallel
exception
to
the
tort
claims
act,
section
2680(c).
that
section
bars
claims
against
the
united
states
in
respect
of
the
detention
of
goods
by
customs
officers.
the
plaintiff
in
kosak,
like
the
respondent
here,
argued
for
a
very
narrow
construction
of
section
2680(c).
the
plaintiff
in
kosak
argued
that
the
congress
only
meant
to
bar
claims
for
damages
that
relate
directly
to
the
detention
of
goods
and
didn't
mean
to
cover
suits
that
challenge
the
loss
or
destruction
of
goods
in
the
course
of
a
customs
detention.
but
this
court
rejected
that
argument.
it
did
so
by
looking
at
the
plain
language
that
congress
used.
it
said
that
congress
didn't
simply
bar
claims
for
the
detention
of
goods
by
customs
officials;
it
barred
claims
in
respect
of
the
detention
of
goods
by
customs
officials.
and
the
court
said
that
in
respect
of
has
the
same
broad
and
all-encompassing
meaning
that
words
such
as
2680(h),
have.
and
therefore,
the
court
said
that
congress
intended
to
bar
suits
against
the
united
states,
in
the
court's
words,
in
any
way
associated
with
the
detention
of
goods,
including
the
plaintiff's
claim
in
kosak.
there's
no
reason
why
section
2680(h)
should
be
given
a
narrower
reading
than
section
2680(c).
section
2680(h)
has
the
arising
out
of
language
that
the
court
in
kosak
analogized
section
2680(c)
to.
therefore,
we
think
in
light
of
the
court's
decision
in
kosak,
section
2680(h)
has
to
bar
claims
that
are
in
any
way
associated
with
an
assault
and
battery
by
a
federal
employee.
in
fact,
the
way
that
the
court
of
appeals
construed
section
2680(h)
is
really
quite
perverse,
because
what
the
court
of
appeals
essentially
said
is
that
the
only
species
of
claim
that
it
bars
is
a
claim
trying
to
hold
the
united
states
liable
on
a
respondeat
superior
basis
for
the
intentional
torts
of
its
employees.
but
there
really
was
very
little
reason
why
congress
should
have
been
concerned
when
it
passed
the
tort
claims
act
in
1946
that
the
united
states
would
be
held
liable
on
a
respondeat
superior
basis
for
intentional
torts,
because
it
was
very
unusual
in
1946,
and
it's
still
unusual
today,
for
an
employer
to
be
held
liable
on
a
respondeat
superior
basis
for
the
intentional
torts
of
its
employees.
and
congress
had
already
put
into
section
1346(b)--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--we
would
think,
mr.
chief
justice,
that
both
suits
would
be
barred
if
the
cause
of
action
was
dependent
upon
proving
an
intentional
tort
by
a
federal
employee.
and
in
both
of
your
hypotheticals
i
think
that
would
be
the
case.
in
other
words,
we
don't
think
it
matters
whether
the
federal
employee
was
acting
within
the
scope
of
his
employment
of
not.
if
it
is
essential
to
the
plaintiff's
case
to
prove
an
intentional
tort
by
a
federal
employee,
we
think
congress
meant
to
foreclose
suits
against
the
united
states
under
2680(h).
however,
we
don't
believe
that
it
necessarily
would
extend
to
suits
challenging
intentional
torts
by
non-employees
such
as
i
discussed
with
justice
stevens.
so
as
i
was
saying,
the
only
thing
that
would
be
covered
by
the
third
circuit's
construction
of
section
2680(h)
are
respondeat
superior
claims,
but
that
was
really
not
a
problem
that
congress
could
have
been
concerned
about
in
1946.
if
it
had
locked
at
the
reported
cases
involving
intentional
torts
by
employees,
it
would
have
seen
that
most
of
those
suits
alleged
a
negligent
supervision
theory,
and
yet,
there's
nothing
in
the
language
or
legislative
history
of
the
intentional
tort
exception
to
suggest
that
congress
meant
to
foreclose
suits
based
on
the
really
less
likely
theory,
which
is
respondeat
superior,
and
allow
the
united
states
to
be
sued
on
the
more
likely
theory,
which
is
negligent
supervision.
and
i
think
that
congress'
amendment
of
the
tort
claims
act,
the
intentional
tort
exception,
in
1974
confirms
this
common
understanding
of
the
clause,
because
as
the
court
is
aware,
congress
amended
the
tort
claims
act
in
1974
to
allow
the
united
states
to
be
sued
for
the
intentional
torts
of
law
enforcement
officers.
and
that
amendment
followed
a
series
of
well-publicized
episodes
in
which
law
enforcement
officers,
primarily
drug
agents,
had
engaged
in
illegal
searches
and
seizures,
no-knock
raids,
and
illegal
arrests.
if
there
was
any
species
of
claim
in
which
it
would
be
plausible
or
would
have
been
plausible
to
hold
the
united
states
liable
on
a
negligence
supervision
theory,
that
was
it,
because
the
evidence
showed
that
many
of
these
illegal
raids
had
been
carried
out
by
the
same
drug
officials
or
the
same
drug
offices.
and
yet,
the
legislative
history
of
the
1974
amendments
are
quite
clear
that
congress
amended
the
act
based
on
the
assumption,
which
was
shared
by
everyone
and
disputed
by
no
one,
that
prior
to
the
amendment
in
1974
the
united
states
could
not
have
been
sued
by
the
victims
of
those
raids
because
of
the
intentional
tort
exception.
and
so
i
think
for
all
of
these
reasons,
the
third
circuit
was
quite
wrong
to
deviate
from
the
plain
language
of
section
2680(h)
in
holding
that
this
suit
was
not
barred
by
the
intentional
tort
exception.
now,
i
would
like
to
turn
briefly
to
our
feres
argument.
we
think
that
for
the
reasons
i
have
just
stated
it
is
inconceivable
that
congress
could
have
intended
to
allow
a
plaintiff
to
circumvent
the
all-encompassing
language
of
the
intentional
tort
exception
by
the
simple
expedient
of
framing
a
complaint
that
sounds
negligence
by
plainly
is
seeking
damages
from
the
united
states
based
on
an
intentional
tort.
nonetheless,
respondent
has
done
precisely
that
here,
and
we
think
that
as
a
result,
her
complaint
runs
squarely
up
against
the
feres
doctrine.
now,
under
this
court's
decision
in
feres,
a
serviceman
can't
sue
the
united
states
under
the
tort
claims
act
for
injuries
that
arise
out
of
or
in
the
course
of
his
military
service.
the
court
has
explained
that
the
feres
doctrine
is
based
principally
on
the
special
relationship
between
a
solider
and
his
superior
officers,
and
it
is
designed
to
prevent
the
adverse
effect
on
military
discipline
that
would
occur
if
soldiers
could
challenge
the
decisions
of
their
superior
officers
in
court
in
the
guise
of
tort
claims
litigation.
it's
really
hard
to
imagine
a
case
that
more
directly
implicates
the
feres
doctrine
than
this
one,
and
i
invite
the
court
to
take
a
look
at
the
allegations
of
respondent's
complaint
to
see
precisely
what
i
mean.
the
crucial
allegations
are
at
page
14
of
the
joint
appendix,
paragraphs
40
and
41
of
the
complaint.
and
the
court
will
see
in
paragraphs
40
and
41
that
respondent
here
alleges
that
private
shearer's
superior
officers
at
fort
bliss
were
negligent
in
failure
to
exert
more
control
over
private
heard,
a
fellow
solider
at
the
base,
in
failing
to
remove
private
heard
from
active
duty,
in
failing
to
prevent
private
heard
from
injuring
his
fellow
soldiers
on
the
base,
and
in
failing
to
warn
those
soldiers
of
the
special
danger
that
private
heard
presented
to
them.
so
what
we
have
here
is
a
tort
claims
act
suit
by
a
soldier
that's
unabashedly
intended
to
hail
his
superior
officers
into
court
to
defend
against
charges
that
they
were
negligent
in
the
way
that
they
controlled
or
refused
to
discipline
or
refused
to
dismiss
from
the
military
some
fellow
soldier
who
was
at
the
same
base.
now,
i
ask
the
court
would
it...
would
a
suit
like
this
require
a
civilian
court
to
referee
disputes
involving
military
personnel?
would
it
require
a
court
to
intrude
into
the
special
relationship
between
a
soldier
and
his
superior
officers?
and
would
a
suit...
would
maintenance
of
a
suit
like
this--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--yes.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
there
would
be
only
the
difference
that
the
court
has
recognized
in
saying
that
the
feres
doctrine
doesn't
apply
to
suits
by
civilians.
but
there...
but
i
think--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--well,
but
i
think
this
court
has
already
said
that
someone
like
the
respondent
stands
in
the
shoes
of
her
soldier.
feres
had
said--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--well,
i
think--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--there's
a
special,
a
special
problem
which
the
court
mentioned
in
feres
in
allowing
soldiers
or
their
representatives
to
challenge
the
actions
of
their
superior
officers.
it
is
clear
that
congress
intended
military
decisionmaking
to
be
the
subject
of
tort
claims
act
suits.
the
definition
of
employee
in
the
act
covers
the
military.
but
this
court
said
in
its
unanimous
decision
in
feres
that
there
are
special
problems
which
congress
could
not
have
intended
in
allowing
a
soldier
to
challenge
the
actions
of
his
superior
officers
in
the
guise
of
adjudicating--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--yes.
and
feres
was
a
case
brought
by
the
administratrix
of
the
estate
of
the
dead
soldier.
but
i
should
say
that
if
this
was
a
suit
brought
by
a
civilian,
we
think
that
the
same
sort
of
inquiry
that
the
respondent
would
have
a
court
make
here
as
to
whether
the
employer,
the
united
states,
acted
negligently
in
its
control
over
its
employee
would
be
barred,
i
think,
by
the
discretionary
function
exception
of
2680(a).
but
feres,
in
a
sense,
is
a
much
broader
exemption
in
the
context
of
suits
by
soldiers.
but
i
think
even
if
this
was
a
civilian
case,
congress
would
never
have
intended--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--yes.
i
think
if
this
was
a
suit
by
a
civilian,
that
would
be
the
case.
but--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--well,
this
is
a
suit
by
a
soldier,
and
feres
i
think
is
a
much
broader
exemption,
and
therefore,
we
have
relied
on
feres.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
i
think
even
then,
justice
marshall,
we'd
be
barred
by
feres
because
the
soldier
would
still
be
challenging
military
decisionmaking
while
he
was
a
member
of
the
armed
forces.
the
failure
of
the
superior
officers
at
fort
bliss
while
he
and
heard
were
members
of
the
armed
forces
not
to
warn
fellow
servicemen
about
the--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--well,
i
think
there's
a
key...
you
have
cases
like
brown
and
brooks
in
which
soldiers
were
not...
this
is
not
a
case
like
that
at
all.
now,
there's
one
other
point
that
bears
mentioning
in
this
regard,
and
that's
this:
when
the
third
circuit
rejected
the
government's
intentional
tort
argument,
what
it
said
was
that
the
basis
of
respondent's
claim
wasn't
the
intentional
tort
by
heard;
it
was
instead...
the
basis
of
respondent's
claim
instead
was
the
actions
of
private
shearer's
superior
officers
at
fort
bliss.
and
yet,
when
the
court
of
appeals
considered
the
government's
feres
claim,
it
quickly
switched
gears
and
totally
reanalyzed
respondent's
suit,
and
said
in
that
context
that
what
respondent
was
challenging
was
not
the
actions
of
private
shearer's
superiors
but
what
had
happened
off
base
when
heard
assaulted
shearer.
now,
this
is
a
bit
of
a
shell
game,
we
think;
when
we
find
the
pea,
the
court
moved
it.
it's
obvious
that
respondent
can't
have
it
both
ways.
she
can't
say
that
the
basis
of
her
suit
is
the
negligence
by
private
shearer's
military
superiors
when
it
suits
her
purposes
under
section
2680(h),
and
then
when
the
government
challenges
her
suit
under
the
feres
doctrine
say
oh,
no,
we're
not
really
challenging
the
actions
of
military
superiors;
we're
challenging
what
happened
off
base
when
private
heard
assaulted
private
shearer.
so
we
think
for
both
of
these
reasons
the
court
of
appeals
was
quite
wrong
in
reversing
the
district
court's
grant
of
summary
judgment
for
the
government,
and
we
would
ask
this
court
to
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
not
unless
the
court
has
questions,
mr.
chief
justice.
