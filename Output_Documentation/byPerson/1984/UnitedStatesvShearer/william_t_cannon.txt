mr.
william
t.
cannon
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
government
characterizes
plaintiff's
action
as
one
growing
out
of
assault
and
battery,
an
intentional
tort
for
which
the
government
has
not
raised
sovereign
immunity.
it
also
claims
plaintiff's
action
is
barred
by
the
feres
doctrine.
the
court
of
appeals
decided
both
that
the
feres
doctrine
does
not
apply
to
this
case,
and
that
plaintiff's
cause
of
action
was
not
barred
by
the
intentional
tort
exception.
section
2680(h)
of
the
federal
tort
claims
act,
the
intentional
tort
exception,
bars
recovery
where
a
claim
arises
out
of
assault
and
battery.
the
government
urges
that
this
exception
should
engulf
not
only
respondeat
superior
claims,
but
also
claims
founded
in
antecedent
negligence,
regardless
of
how
dire
or
severe
that
negligence
predicate
is,
whenever
the
intervening
tort
feasor
is
a
government
employee.
the
court
of
appeals
determined
that
where
an
intervening
intentional
tort
arises
proximately,
predictably
and
foreseeably,
antecedent
negligence
of
the
government
causing
injury,
then
the
intentional
tort
exception
does
not
bar
such
a
claim.
the
board
interpretation
that
the
government
would
give
to
the
statutory
language
of
the
exception
is
that
found
incorrect
by
this
court
in
kosak.
speaking
about
the
exception
found
in
2680(c)
respecting
the
detention
of
goods
or
merchandise
by
an
officer
of
customs,
this
court
noted
that
unduly
generous
interpretations
of
the
exceptions
run
the
risk
of
defeating
the
central
purpose
of
the
statute,
citing
united
states
v.
yellow
cab.
the
claim
before
this
court
is
not
a
subterfuge
for
an
intentional
assault
and
battery
claim
admittedly
barred
under
the
ftca.
the
ftca
was
designed
to
compensate
victims
of
negligence
in
the
conduct
of
governmental
activity
in
circumstances
like
those
in
which
a
private
person
would
be
liable.
by
its
statutory
terms
it
provides
for
district
court
jurisdiction
over
any
claim
founded
in
negligence
brought
against
the
united
states.
mr.
william
t.
cannon
there
is
no
analog,
mr.
chief
justice,
in
the
private
sector
between
maintaining
a
force
and
a
traditional
claim
brought
under
the
ftca.
but
i
think
that
whole
area
is
really
in
the
feres
area
as
opposed
to
the
intentional
tort
exception;
and
i
intend
to
address
that
in
my
discussion
of
the
feres
doctrine,
if
it
please
the
court.
the
plaintiff's
cause
of
action
in
this
case
is
premised
upon
section
448
of
the
restatement
of
torts
which
is
entitled
"intentionally
tortious
or
criminal
acts
done
under
opportunity
afforded
by
an
actor's
negligence.
"
state
and
federal
courts
across
this
land
have
entertained
successful
negligence
actions
under
section
448,
notwithstanding
the
presence
of
gross,
violent
and
often
homicidal
conduct
on
the
part
of
intervening
tort
feasors.
indeed,
appellee's
brief
references
such
cases.
recovery
against
the
government
has
been
had
in
such
cases,
and
several
of
them,
including
jablonski,
gibson,
white,
underwood,
fair,
hicks
and
rodgers
have
also
been
cited
for
this
court.
the
government,
however,
seeks
to
distinguish
such
cases
on
the
bases
that
the
intervening
tort
feasor
in
those
cases
was
not
a
government
employee...
a
distinction
that
the
circuit
court
did
not
address
in
its
opinion.
the
government
clearly
advocates
that
the
doctrine
espoused
in
panella
v.
united
states
by
judge,
later
justice
harlan,
and
its
progeny,
including
naisbitt
and
hughes,
barring
recovery
under
section
2680(h)
any
time
the
intervening
tort
feasor
is
a
government
employee
should
be
the
interpretation
adopted
by
this
court.
in
attempting
to
explain
away
cases
in
which
the
government
has
been
held
liable
involving
intervening
tort
feasors
who
were
government
employees,
the
government
has
attempted
to
distinguish
those
cases
on
the
bases
of
a
special
duty
undertaken
in
hospital,
parole
and
prison
situations.
neither
approach
is
correct.
the
proper
object
of
a
court
attempting
to
construe
one
of
the
subsections
of
2680
is
to
identify
the
circumstances
which
are
within
the
words
and
reason
of
the
statute.
interpreting
the
intent
of
congress
in
adopting
the
intentional
tort
exception,
it
seems
more
likely
to
believe
that
the
policy
underlying
the
exception
was
to
insulate
the
government
from
liability
for
acts
it
was
powerless
to
prevent,
or
which
would
make
defense
of
a
lawsuit
unusually
difficult,
rather
than
it
was
intended
to
defeat
actions
steeped
in
negligence
merely
because
the
intervening
tort
feasor
was
a
government
employee.
there
is
no
sound
basis
for
disallowing
a
section
448
case
merely
because
the
intervening
tort
feasor
is
a
government
employee.
as
was
said
by
the
circuit
court,
the
intentional
tort
exception
should
bar
a
cause
of
action
only
if
negligence
is
a
remote
cause
of
the
injury,
or
plaintiff,
through
artful
pleadings
with
conclusory
allegations,
attempts
to
create
a
negligence
issue
where
none
exists.
where
the
third
circuit
decided
the
assault
and
battery
of
private
heard
upon
private
shearer
was
a
natural
result
of
the
government's
failure
to
exercise
due
care,
the
assault
and
battery
may
be
deemed
to
have
its
roots
in
negligence,
and
is
therefore
within
the
scope
of
the
federal
tort
claims
act.
this
will
require
the
plaintiff
in
any
case
to
allege
sufficient
facts
to
demonstrate
that
the
government
knew
or
should
have
known
that
its
employee
was
dangerous
prior
to
the
injurious
act.
unlike
cases
such
as
naisbitt,
collins
and
wine
cited
by
the
government
for
the
proposition
that
a
negligence
analysis
is
not
necessary
where
the
intervening
tort
feasor
is
a
government
employee,
the
factual
negligence
predicate
in
shearer
is
startling,
shocking,
and
of
such
magnitude
that
the
government
should
not
be
heard
to
complain
that
liability
for
their
blatant
negligence
should
not
attach.
a
negligent
omission
arises
where
the
act
necessary
to
avoid
negligence
should
have
occurred.
the
failure
to
eliminate
private
heard
in
this
matter,
convicted
of
homicide
while
serving
at
his
last
duty
assignment,
despite
ringing
recommendations
from
his
superior
officers
that
he
be
eliminated
from
the
service,
and
exposing
service
members
like
shearer
to
his
violent
propensities
without
warning
amounts
to
negligence
of
a
gross
order.
mr.
william
t.
cannon
justice
marshall.
mr.
william
t.
cannon
they
were
off
the
base,
but--
mr.
william
t.
cannon
--they
exposed
him
to
the
jeopardy
of
contact
with
shearer
because
they
failed
to
eliminate,
to
supervise
or
to
warn
about.
it
is
true
that
the
tort
took
place
off
the
base,
but
the
complaint
rests
in
negligence
at
the
failure
of
the
service
to
have
eliminated
shearer
so
that
he
did
not
pose
a
threat
on
base
or
off
base
to
private
shearer,
although
admittedly--
mr.
william
t.
cannon
--they
can't
control
him
off
base,
but
they
had
the
opportunity
to
control
him
within
their
numbers
so
that
he
at
the
time
of
this
incident
no
longer--
mr.
william
t.
cannon
--just
by
eliminating
him,
by
looking
at
the
regulations--
mr.
william
t.
cannon
--beg
your
pardon?
mr.
william
t.
cannon
no,
sir.
[laughter]
mr.
william
t.
cannon
when
he
was
returned...
when
he
was
returned
from
germany
after
being
released
from
prison,
the
service
had
an
obligation
under
its
regulations
to
eliminate
him.
mr.
william
t.
cannon
yes.
mr.
william
t.
cannon
if
the
chief
justice
is
asking
if
somebody
killed
after
he
was
released
could
bring
an
action
against
the
service,
in
my
opinion
no,
they
would
have
acted
responsibly
in
discharging
him
from
their
membership.
mr.
william
t.
cannon
well,
i
think
that
the
difference
is
that
the
service
had
an
opportunity
and
a
mandatory
duty
to
eliminate
this
person
with
demonstrated
homidical
tendencies,
an
obligation
that
they
failed.
mr.
william
t.
cannon
there
would
be
no
negligence
on
the
part
of
the
government
if
they
had
properly
eliminated
him
and
then
he
had
killed
someone
after
that.
the
negligence
of
the
government--
mr.
william
t.
cannon
--that
is
right,
chief
justice.
that
is
correct.
and
if
they
had--
mr.
william
t.
cannon
--the
impact
would
have
been
the
same,
but
the
government
would
not
be
liable
in
that
situation
because
they
would
have
discharged
their
duty.
mr.
william
t.
cannon
yes,
justice
stevens.
mr.
william
t.
cannon
yes,
sir.
mr.
william
t.
cannon
to
eliminate
him.
mr.
william
t.
cannon
to
eliminate
him
is
not
to
kill
him,
as
someone
has
suggested.
it
is
merely
to
administratively
eliminate
him
from
the
service.
that
was
the
recommendation.
mr.
william
t.
cannon
well,
they
could
hardly
imprison
him
because--
mr.
william
t.
cannon
--yes.
he
had
served
his
time--
mr.
william
t.
cannon
--well,
i
think
it
will
be
too
strong
to
say
that
they
were
advised
that
he
would
kill
someone
else,
but
certainly--
mr.
william
t.
cannon
--he
put
the
service
on
notice
because
of
his
past
conduct
that
he
had
that
potential.
mr.
william
t.
cannon
they
had
a
duty
to
follow
the
recommendations
of
those
officers
who
had
recommended
that
he
be
removed
from
the
service,
that's
correct.
mr.
william
t.
cannon
well,
there's
no
difference,
i
don't
think,
between
someone
who's
been
committed
for
20
years
to
a
psychiatric
institution,
and
he's
served
his
time,
and
the
doctors
say
there's
nothing
more
we
can
do
for
him,
and
they
release
him,
and
then
he
turns
around
and
kills
someone.
well,
there's
hardly
anything
more
that
could
be
said
in
terms
of
what
the
hospital
could
have
done.
but
here
the
service
failed
in
its
obligation
to
remove
from
its
membership
someone
who
had
killed
before
and
who
had
been
the
subject
of
repeated
recommendations
for
elimination.
mr.
william
t.
cannon
i
think
not.
i
think
it
would
be
a
close
question.
i
think
it's
a
stronger
negligence
predicate
if
he
is
still
in
the
service,
but
i
think
the
government
would
benefit
from
the
fact
situation
that
you
present,
justice
marshall.
panella
and
its
progeny
advocating
a
per
se
doctrine
of
immunity
where
the
intervening
tort
feasor
is
a
government
employee
are
contradictory
to
the
intended
purpose
of
the
ftca
and
contradict,
rather
than
espouse,
the
congressional
attitude
in
passing
the
tort
claims
act
reflected
in
judge
cardozo's
remarks
in
anderson
v.
john
l.
hayes,
that
the
exemption
of
a
sovereign
from
suit
involves
hardship
enough
where
consent
has
been
held.
we
are
not
to
add
to
its
rigor
by
refinement
of
construction
where
consent
has
been
announced.
panella,
upon
which
the
government
has
placed
so
much
reliance,
of
course
did
permit
a
section
448
type
recovery
by
holding
that
the
intentional
tort
exception
does
not
apply
to
a
non-government
employee.
to
the
extent
that
the
circuit
court
decision
in
panella
affirmed
the
district
court
holding
that
a
case
founded
in
negligence
will
not
lie
where
the
intervening
tort
feasor
is
a
government
employee,
panella
should
not
be
followed
by
this
court.
the
ftca
is
a
negligence
statute.
it
permits
recovery
for
the
negligent
acts
of
its
employees
committed
in
the
course
of
their
employment.
but
the
case
before
the
court
is
not
one
founded
on
a
battery
negligently
performed.
the
negligence
upon
which
suit
is
founded
is
related
to
the
battery
only
to
the
extent
that
the
battery
is
the
proximate,
predictable
and
foreseeable
outgrowth
of
the
government's
negligence
in
this
case.
what
was
said
by
the
third
circuit
in
the
gibson
case
to
the
effect
that
the
very
risk
which
constituted
the
defendant's
negligence
was
the
probability
of
the
action
which
occasioned
the
injury
is
applicable
to
the
case
at
bar.
the
government's
efforts
to
distinguish
cases
like
underwood
and
fair
where
the
intervening
tort
feasor
was
a
government
employee
on
the
bases
that
those
cases
involve
extension
of
a
special
duty
of
protection
to
the
intervening
tort
feasors,
in
those
cases
because
they
have
been
hospitalized,
is
not
convincing.
as
the
jablonski
ninth
circuit
court
said,
it
is
more
significant
in
these
cases
that
they
are
based
on
negligence,
not
assault
and
battery.
indeed,
although
the
government
says
that
section
319
of
the
restatement
involving
a
theory
of
negligence
where
the
government
does
assume
a
special
duty,
that
that
should
be
some
sort
of
demarcation.
but
the
fact
is
that
section
319
just
gives
a
plaintiff
an
alternate
theory
of
negligence
in
addition
to
448,
and
there
is
nothing
about
section
319
that
involves
indeed
a
waiver
of
the
exception,
in
spite
of
which
recovery
has
been
permitted
in
those
cases.
the
better
explanation
for
these
cases
is
that
the
injuries
were
rooted
in
government
negligence
to
a
depth
that
was
not
superseded
by
the
intervening
tort
feasor.
as
occurred
in
the
circuit
court,
employment
of
a
government
versus
a
non-government
employee
analysis
should
be
rejected
properly
in
favor
of
a
proximate
cause
analysis.
the
federal
judiciary
is
up
to
the
task
of
weeding
out
claims
of
negligence
which
involve
no
more
than
artful
pleadings
from
those
legitimately
steeped
in
negligence.
they
should
be
given
that
opportunity
regardless
of
whether
or
not
the
intervening
tort
feasor
is
a
government
employee.
with
regard
to
the
feres
doctrine,
the
court
of
a
appeals
determined
that
the
feres
doctrine
did
not
bar
the
instant
case.
mr.
william
t.
cannon
of
course,
justice.
mr.
william
t.
cannon
that's
correct.
mr.
william
t.
cannon
yes,
sir.
mr.
william
t.
cannon
in
the
analysis
of
the
court
of
appeals,
shearer
did
not
sustain
his
injury
either
in
the
course
of
or
incident
to
military
service.
the
circuit
court's
application
of
that
feres
doctrine
focused
on
the
relationship
between
the
serviceman
and
the
military
at
the
time
and
place
the
injury
was
sustained.
other
circuit
courts
had
conducted
a
feres
analysis
upon
the
time,
place
and
circumstance
surrounding
the
negligent
conduct.
the
proper
analysis
is
to
consider
the
facts
of
this
case
within
the
framework
of
feres
ground
as
explicated
by
stencel.
number
one,
the
distinctively
federal
in
character
relationship
between
the
government
and
members
of
its
armed
forces:
number
two,
the
statutory
no-fault
compensation
scheme
set
forth
in
the
veterans'
benefit
act
for
injuries
incurred
incident
to
service;
and
thirdly,
the
peculiar
and
special
relationship
of
the
soldier
to
his
superiors
and
the
effects
of
the
maintenance
of
such
suits
on
discipline.
the
government
concedes
in
its
brief
that
only
the
third
prong
of
stencel
is
dispositive
in
any
of
these
cases.
that
conclusion
is
no
doubt
wrong
from
the
fact
that
the
relationship
between
the
government
and
its
soldiers
is
no
more
sovereign
than
that
which
exists
between
other
federal
agencies
subject
to
the
federal
tort
claims
act
and
its
employees.
also--
mr.
william
t.
cannon
--the
brown
case.
mr.
william
t.
cannon
no,
sir.
and
that
is
not
the
brown
case.
mr.
william
t.
cannon
yes.
mr.
william
t.
cannon
well,
there
are
also
cases,
mr.
chief
justice,
where
the
government
has
been
found
liable
where
they
had
faa
personnel
within
their
membership
who
did
not
perform
their
duties
properly,
and
that
was
found--
mr.
william
t.
cannon
--no,
not
before
this
court,
mr.
chief
justice.
in
the
circuit
court.
with
regard
to
the
sovereign
relationship
of
the
soldier
to
the
government,
the
immediacy
of
shearer's
peculiar
and
special
relationship
to
his
military
superiors
had
been
severed
in
this
case
by
his
authorized
leave
status.
in
addition,
the
veterans'
benefit
act,
which
is
the
second
prong
of
stencel,
of
course
does
not
contain
an
election
of
remedies
clause
in
the
manner
of
the
federal
employees'
workmen's
compensation
act,
and
shearer's
injuries,
we
contend,
are
also
not
incident
to
service,
which
is
an
appendix
to
the
comments
about
the
veterans'
benefit
act
in
stencel.
this
court's
concern
about
the
impact
upon
military
discipline
where
suit
is
brought
on
behalf
of
a
serviceman
is
demonstrably
set
forth
in
stencel
and
chappell.
despite
its
importance,
however,
the
military
discipline
factor,
i
suggest,
is
not
an
absolute.
it
is
a
shorthand
means
of
anticipating
the
consequences
of
having
civilian
courts
inquire
extensively
into
military
affairs.
however,
it
is
not
the
mere
possible
effect
on
the
maintenance
of
military
discipline,
but
the
degree
of
that
effect
which
should
be
controlling.
this
case
does
not
involve
suit
by
enlisted
members
against
their
commanding
officers,
as
in
chappell,
or
involve
challenges
to
military
activity,
such
as
the
radiation
cases
which
involve
issues
unique
to
the
claimant's
military
duty,
training
and
combat.
this
case
does
not
involve
inquiry
by
the
district
court
into
the
complex,
subtle
and
professional
decisions
as
to
the
composition,
training,
equipping
and
control
of
the
military
force
as
bespoken
by
this
court
in
gilligan
v.
morgan,
nor
does
it
involve
the
battle
commander's
poor
judgment,
the
army
surgeon's
slip
of
hand,
or
the
defective
jeep
spoken
of
in
the
brooks
case.
mr.
william
t.
cannon
justice
rehnquist,
there
is
no
question
that
if
this
case
involves
a
review
of
policy
or
the
formation
of
regulations
that
it
would
be
barred.
it
is
clear
in
the
position
of
the
plaintiff,
however,
that
this
is
a
case
where
those
regulations
were
ignored,
not
that
they
were
not
properly
drafted.
the
regulations
were
on
the
books.
they
called
for
the
elimination
from
the
service
of
this
person
under
these
circumstances,
i
suggest,
and
those
regulations
were
simply
ignored.
they
do
not
require
the
intervention
of
military
expertise
or
military
judgment.
it's
a
straightforward
personnel
decision
such
as
that
found
by
industry
and
business
on
any
given
day
anywhere
in
these
united
states.
mr.
william
t.
cannon
well,
i
suggest
that
the
distinction
is
if
we're
reviewing
policy,
then
the
claim
is
lost.
if
we're
merely
talking
about
negligence
at
the
operational
level
by
persons
who
simply
ignore
the
regulations,
then
we
have
a
claim
that
is
viable
under
the
federal
tort
claims
act
and
which
is
not
barred
by
feres.
mr.
william
t.
cannon
yes.
mr.
william
t.
cannon
oh,
they
clearly
have
a
case
without
question.
there's
no
feres
barrier
at
all.
mr.
william
t.
cannon
as
justice
marshall
pointed
out
in
the
stencel
case,
if
the
jet
aircraft
had
crashed
into
a
civilian
house,
there
is
no
question
at
all
but
that
the
occupants
of
that
house
would
have
had
a
viable
ftca
action
against
the
government
for
their
negligence.
mr.
william
t.
cannon
no.
no,
i...
of
course,
the
business
about
crashing
into
a
house
is
purely
a
hypothetical
situation
proposed
by
justice
marshall,
so
i
don't
think
that
that--
mr.
william
t.
cannon
--then
clearly
the
bartender
or
his
heirs
or
his
estate
would
have
a
viable
claim.
mr.
william
t.
cannon
there
was
nothing
in
his
history
that
would
suggest
that
he
was
in
fact
capable
of
robbing
a
bar,
but
certainly
there
is
plenty
in
his
history
to
suggest
that
he
was
a
man
of
violence.
and
to
the
effect
that
i
suggested
that
the
government
would
be
liable
to
the
bartender,
please
let
me
correct
my
position.
that
would
not
be
position.
mr.
william
t.
cannon
no,
sir.
mr.
william
t.
cannon
yes,
sir.
the
threat
to
military
discipline
in
this
case--
mr.
william
t.
cannon
--well,
i
think...
i
think
it
owes...
i
think
the
service
owes
a
duty
to
its
members--
mr.
william
t.
cannon
--not
to
unusually
jeopardize
them.
mr.
william
t.
cannon
yes,
sir.
the
threat
to
military
discipline
in
this
case
is
minimal.
the
test
which
should
be
applied
is
not
a
but
for
test...
that
is,
not
but
for
the
fact
that
he
was
in
the
service
he
would
not
have
been
killed,
but
whether
shearer
was
indeed
performing
duties
of
such
character
as
to
undermine
traditional
concepts
of
military
discipline
if
his
administratrix
was
permitted
to
maintain
a
civil
suit
for
injury
resulting
therefrom.
there
is
no
second-guessing
of
military
orders
involved
or
any
review
of
the
adequacy
of
the
army's
personnel
regulations,
just
whether
they
were
followed
or
ignored...
a
decision
that
will
not
require
military
expertise
or
judgment.
it
is
difficult
to
contend,
as
the
government
does,
that
this
suit
by
mrs.
shearer
for
the
death
of
her
son,
negligently
occasioned
by
the
government,
could
threaten
military
relationships,
which
are
the
primary
focus
of
feres.
this
case
does
not
involve
the
negligent
discharge
of
a
red
eye
missile.
there
is
no
threat
to
the
command
hierarchy
where
the
negligence
involved
does
not
involve
military
decisions,
but
rather
decisions
by
the
military
involving
the
retention
of
a
member
in
the
same
manner
that
those
problems
are
faced
routinely
in
business
and
industry.
if
permitted
to
proceed
to
trial
in
the
district
court,
this
case
will
not
jeopardize
the
need
for
unhesitating
and
decisive
action
by
officers
and
equally
disciplined
responses
by
enlisted
personnel.
like
one
of
the
two
plaintiffs
in
brooks,
the
death
of
vernon
shearer
was
not
caused
by
his
military
service
except
in
the
sense
that
all
human
events
depend
upon
what
has
already
transpired.
a
soldier
is
ready
to
risk
life
and
limb
where
national
survival
is
at
stake.
there
is
no
justification
for
requiring
him,
as
the
government
proposes,
to
bear
the
risk
of
operational
negligence
in
domestic,
noncombat
circumstances
where
the
loss
is
so
monumental
and
the
risk
to
military
interests
so
minimal.
thank
you.
