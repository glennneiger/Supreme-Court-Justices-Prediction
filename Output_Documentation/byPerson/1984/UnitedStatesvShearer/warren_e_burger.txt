chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
geller,
i
think
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
think
there
might
be
a
difference,
mr.
geller,
if
the
federal
employee
is,
as
justice
stevens'
question
suggested,
a
federal
employee
is
in
a
position
where
he
has
been
told
of
the
injured
person...
that
is,
as
the
prison
guard
vis-a-vis
the
prisoner,
as
compared
with
the
prison
guard,
for
example,
meeting
somebody
in
a
local
bar
and
committing
an
assault
or
killing
him,
as
was
the
case
here?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
cannon.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
where
is
the
analog
to
maintaining
an
armed
force
in
the
private
sector?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
suppose
they
had
discharged
him
and
a
week
later
he'd
gone
out
and
killed
somebody.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
theory
of
your
case
is
that
it
was
the
bad
conduct
of
the
military
in
failing
to
train
him
or
cure
him--
--eliminate
him.
would
the
homicide
after
the
discharge
be
subject
to
a
recovery?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
the
cause
that
you
assert
in
this
case
is
the
same
in
both
situations,
in
the
hypothetical
and
in
the
actual,
is
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
are
you
suggesting
that
the
difference
would
be
that
he
wouldn't
be
killing
a
serviceman;
if
he
had
those
homicidal
tendencies
he
might
kill
some
civilian
on
the
outside?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
part
of
your
case
is
that
the
government
didn't
properly
handle
him
while
they
had
him
in
the
service.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
then
the
impact...
the
impact
of
that
failure
would
be
the
same
on
a
civilian
as
it
was
on
this
fellow
soldier.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
are
you
familiar,
mr.
cannon,
with
a
case
in
the
eighth
circuit,
the
name
of
which
i
don't
recall,
where
suits
were
brought--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--on
the
basis
of
the
erroneous
weather
reports
and
erroneous
judgments
of
the
united
states
engineers
about
the
flood
level
of
the
mississippi
river?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
no.
that's
not
brown.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now,
there
the
eighth
circuit
held,
and
i
believe
this
court
denied
cert,
that
there
just
was
no
recovery.
now,
the
theory
of
that
case
was
much
like
yours.
the
government
hadn't
either...
they
had
made
misjudgments
about
the
rainfall
and
about
the
river
level
and
all
that.
how
do
you
distinguish
that
from
this
case?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
this
court?
chief
justice
burger
what
about
that?
chief
justice
burger
what
case
would
you
say
supports
your
conclusion
that
they'd
clearly
have
a
case?
chief
justice
burger
well,
i
take
it
from
that
you
say
that
this
fellow
was
the
same
as
the
pilot
of
that
plane
who
crashed
into
the
house?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
have
anything
further,
mr.
geller?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
think
not.
thank
you,
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
we'll
hear
arguments
next
in
kerr-mcgee
against
navajo
tribe
of
indians.
