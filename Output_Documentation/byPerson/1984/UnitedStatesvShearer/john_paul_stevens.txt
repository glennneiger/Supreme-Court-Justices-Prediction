justice
stevens
may
i
ask
one
question
on
the
government's
theory?
supposing
we
take
it
out
of
the
military
context
for
a
moment
and
put
it
in
a
federal
prison,
and
there
was
an
allegation
of
negligence
in
administering
the
discipline
and
all
the
rest
of
the
prison,
and
that
one
inmate
assaulted
another
inmate
due
to
the
negligence
in
supervision.
is
that
within
the
exemption
or
not?
justice
stevens
i
understand
there's
a
line
of
cases.
justice
stevens
but
it
seems
to
me
if
you
read
it
as
you
say,
you
focus
on
the
incident
out
of
which
the
claim
arises--
justice
stevens
--i
have
difficulty
distinguishing
the
case.
i
mean
mayb--
justice
stevens
--well,
what
if
it
was
done
by
a
guard
who
was
a
poorly
supervised
guard?
justice
stevens
you
would
read
the
arising
out
of
language
to
mean
arising
out
of
an
assault
by
a
federal
employee.
justice
stevens
may
i
ask
on
that
point,
mr.
geller,
supposing
that
the
suit
were
not
by
a
soldier
but
by
a
civilian
who
had
been
killed
by
this--
justice
stevens
--same
military
person,
and
you
had
precisely
the
same
allegation.
would
there
be
any
difference
in
the
intrusion
into
military
affairs?
justice
stevens
why
shouldn't
it?
why
does
the
reasoning
distinguish
depending
on
the
character
of
the
plaintiff?
because
here,
of
course,
it's
the
widow
or
the
mother,
i
gather.
justice
stevens
then
why
are
these
policy
concerns
that
you
describe
about
the
relationship--
justice
stevens
--between
the
commanding
officer
and
the
subordinate--
justice
stevens
--for
that
purpose,
the
widow
is
the
soldier.
justice
stevens
what
you're
saying
is
that
even
if
feres
might
not
apply,
you
might
have
a
defense
under
the
discretionary
function
exemption
in
any
event.
that
would
apply
here,
too.
justice
stevens
but
you
didn't
plead
that
here
because
feres
is
broader.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
mr.
cannon,
let
me
follow
up
on
that
a
minute.
justice
john
paul
stevens
supposing
you
had
at
the
time
they
made
the
wrong
decision,
whatever
it
was,
before
this--
justice
stevens
--you
had
some
military
officers
sitting
around
saying
this
is
a
dangerous
man,
psychiatrists
have
told
us
he's
going
to
kill
somebody
in
90
days.
what
was
their
duty?
justice
stevens
what
do
you
mean
by
eliminate?
justice
stevens
turn
him
loose
on
society,
then,
you're
saying.
justice
stevens
well,
that's
my
point.
justice
stevens
and
they're
advised
in
advance
he's
going
to
kill
somebody,
and
the
question
is
they
had
a
duty
to
protect
other
servicemen,
and
the
heck
with
the
civilian
population.
justice
stevens
but
you're
saying
they
were
on
notice
that
it
might
happen.
justice
stevens
so
you're
saying
that
military
personnel
with
those
facts
had
a
duty
to
turn
him
loose?
justice
stevens
and
you
think
there
would
be
a
net
saving
in
human
life
by
doing
that?
justice
stevens
before
you
get
into
the
feres
doctrine,
can
i
interrupt
you
with
one
question?
justice
stevens
do
i
correctly
understand
that
there's
no
claim
that
the
murder
was
committed
with
a
government
weapon,
or
it's
not
failure
to
supervise
a
soldier
in
the
use
of
his
weapon?
justice
stevens
yeah,
i
see.
it's
just
that
he
got
his
own
gun
and--
justice
stevens
--i
see.
justice
stevens
this
has
been
too
fast
for
me.
why
wouldn't
the
government
be
liable
to
the
bartender
under
your
theory?
justice
stevens
oh,
i
see.
justice
stevens
the
bartender
is
outside
the
protected
class.
