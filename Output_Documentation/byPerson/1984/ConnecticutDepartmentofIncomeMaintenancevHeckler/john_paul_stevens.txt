mr.
miller,
may
i
just
interrupt,
because
i
think
you'll
be
coming
to
this
right
now.
it
would
be
helpful
to
me
if
you
would
tell
me
at
what
stage
in
the
chronology
the
people
that
you
now
say
are
covered
became
covered.
they
were
clearly
not
covered
before
1967,
i
guess.
justice
stevens
and
i
guess
they
weren't
covered
by
the
'67
amendment
or
the
'71
amendment.
just
when
did
they
become
covered?
justice
stevens
that
was
the
aged,
blind
and
disabled,
wasn't
it?
justice
stevens
but
are
you
contending
that
the
coverage
here
was
created
in
1971?
justice
stevens
i
understand.
justice
stevens
so
the...
you
don't
have
to
rely
on
the
'72
amendment
then.
justice
stevens
would
you
clarify
something
for
me
i
thought
i
understood,
but
i'm
not
sure
i
do.
in
this
particular
facility,
say
there
were
75
percent
of
the
people
were
mental
patients
and
25
percent
were
nonmental
or
tuberculosis
patients,
if
it
is
an
imd,
as
you
contend,
and
if
they
continued
to
have
the
25
nonmental
patients
there,
they
would
not
be
reimbursed
for
them,
would
they?
justice
stevens
does
that
suggest
they
are
mutually
exclusive
categories
then?
i
mean
you
can't...
if
you
are--
justice
stevens
--may
i
ask
again
about
the
subparagraph
15
of
the
section
we
were
talking
about?
why
wouldn't
their
reading
make
sense
if
the
regulation
read
the
way
they
thought
it
did;
in
other
words,
that
imds
were
defined
as
psychiatric
hospitals.
wouldn't
it
make
perfectly
good
sense
that
that
was
the...
because
you
could
conceivably
have--
justice
stevens
--well,
then
what
i'm
suggesting
is
one
can
read
it
either
way.
that's
all
i...
it
makes
sense.
justice
stevens
i'm
puzzled
by
the
first
example,
because
the
end
of
the
section...
there's
one
definition
of...
i
don't
know
what
it
is...
intermediate
care
facility,
the
last
part
of
it
says,
"any
public
institution
or
distinct
part
thereof
for
mental
diseases
or
mental
defects.
"
i
thought
you
could
divide
up
institutions
by
floors.
justice
stevens
oh,
i
see.
justice
stevens
this
is
incredible.
