ms.
kathryn
anne
oberly
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
there
is
only
one
narrow
question
before
this
court
today,
in
response
to
justice
o'connor's
questions
to
my
colleague
at
the
beginning
of
his
argument.
the
single
question
before
this
court
is
whether
icfs
and
imds
are
mutually
exclusive
types
of
facilities
in
any
and
all
circumstances.
the
court
does
not
have
before
it,
because
connecticut
has
not
presented
as
a
question
for
the
court
to
decide
how
the
secretary
should
determine
whether
any
particular
icf
is
also
an
imd.
the
50
percent
rule--
ms.
kathryn
anne
oberly
--in
theory,
your
honor,
they
could.
what
connecticut
has
done
in
this
case
is
a
good
example
actually
of
responsible
state
behavior
in
response
to
the
department's
action.
instead
of
scattering
the
patients
at
middletown
haven
once
the
disallowance
issue
came
up
at
this
facility,
connecticut
took
all
of
the
non-mental
patients
out
of
middletown
haven,
the
people...
the
stroke
patients,
the
physically
disabled...
put
them
in
general
icfs
or
skilled
nursing
facilities,
and
converted
middletown
haven
to
a
100
percent
mental
facility
for
which
it
is
now
claiming
no
reimbursement
whatsoever.
and
we
don't
think
that
the
court
ought
to
decide
the
case
on
the
assumption
of
bad
faith
by
the
states
in
shifting
their
patients
to
places
that
may
not
be
suited
for
their
needs
simply
to
maximize
federal
funding.
and
the
way
connecticut
has
responded
demonstrates
that
states
aren't
going
to
act
that
way
if
they
in
fact
have
the
best
interests
of
their
mentally
ill
citizens--
ms.
kathryn
anne
oberly
--at
heart.
ms.
kathryn
anne
oberly
as
far
as
recoupment
is
concerned,
all
we
know
is
the
$18
million
involved
in
the
four
consolidated
cases,
of
which
connecticut's
is
one,
which
is
a
substantial
amount
of
money.
but
the
greater--
ms.
kathryn
anne
oberly
--pardon?
ms.
kathryn
anne
oberly
yes,
yes.
ms.
kathryn
anne
oberly
some
states
have
no
facilities
like
this.
california,
on
the
other
hand,
i
think
has
probably
about
26,
so
it
varies
widely
from
state
to
state.
they
haven't
all
been
audited
yet.
but
in
a
general
answer
to
your
question,
yes,
most
states
thought
that...
there's
uncontroverted
testimony
in
the
record
in
this
case
that
connecticut
was
shifting
patients
from
its
state
mental
hospitals
to
middletown
haven
in
order
to
maximize
federal
funding;
and
i
think
that
was
common
among
a
number
of
states.
i
mean
that
was
the
purpose,
to
get
medicaid
coverage
that
they
knew
they
couldn't
get
if
the
patients
remained
in
a
mental
hospital.
i
don't
think
that
was
unique
to
connecticut.
but
not
enough
of
the
states
went
through
the
audit
process
for
me
to
be
able
to
tell
you
if
that
was
a
nationwide
phenomenon.
i
would...
i
do
think
it's
important,
though,
although
the
criteria,
the
50
percent
rule,
that
sort
of
thing
is
of
some
interest,
it
is
not
before
the
court.
ms.
kathryn
anne
oberly
no,
your
honor,
we
have
not,
and
we
disagree
with
mr.
miller's
characterization
of
our
early
regulations.
there
was,
beginning
in
1966,
which
was
the
year
after
medicaid
was
passed,
and
continuing
to
the
present
one
regulation
which
defined
an
imd
as
a
psychiatric
hospital.
but
as
mr.
miller
has
just
conceded
in
his
argument,
the
interpretation
he
gives
to
that
regulation
in
his
brief
is
really
probably
not
the
correct
interpretation.
it
appears
at
page
27
of
his
reply
brief,
not
page
28.
and
in
fact,
the
purpose
of
that
regulation
is
to
make
sure
that
the
elderly,
as
to
which
all
parties
agree
do
get
coverage
in
mental
hospitals,
are
not
placed
in
substandard
psychiatric
hospitals.
so
there
is
a
need
for
a
regulation
defining
an
imd
in
terms
of
a
psychiatric
hospital
that's
been
accredited
as
a
psychiatric
hospital
by
the
joint
commission
on
the
accreditation
of
hospitals.
but
there
is
also
side
by
side
with
that
regulation
and
has
been
since
1966
the
overall
character
regulation,
which
is
the
one
we
rely
on
for
skilled
nursing
facilities
and
intermediate
care
facilities,
that
provides
that
when
you're
not
talking
about
a
hospital,
when
you're
talking
about
a
different
type
of
facility,
the
relevant
criteria
is
the
overall
character
of
the
facility,
whether
the
facility
was
established
and
maintained
primarily
to
care
and
treat
the
mentally
ill.
and
that
regulation
has
been
hhs's
position
since
1966,
since
the
first
chance
it
had
to
enact
any
regulations
after
medicaid.
it
has
never
changed.
and
it
stands
side
by
side
with
the
psychiatric
hospital
regulation,
but
they
each
serve
and
cover
different
facilities.
so
we
see
no
inconsistency
and
no
change
in
the
department's
position
for
the
entire
applicable
time
period.
ms.
kathryn
anne
oberly
i
would
suggest
that
the
states
should
have
sought
advice.
in
1976
connecticut
acknowledges
that
it
was
aware
of
the
federal
government's
position,
but
it
wasn't
until
some
time
in
1979
that
it
wrote
a
letter
asking
for
clarification
of
that
position.
the
answer
it
got
back
covered
a
multitude
of
different
possible
factual
possibilities.
but
as
to
a
facility
like
middletown
haven,
the
answer
it
got
back
was
crystal
clear,
that
the
department
would
treat
that
sort
of
facility
as
an
institution
for
mental
diseases.
connecticut
says
it
knew
in
1976
what
the
department's
position
was,
or
at
least
that
there
was
some
question
that
it
differed
from
the
state's
position.
it
certified
middletown
haven
to
open
in
1977,
claimed
reimbursement
for
two
years
without
in
that
two-year
period
going
back
to
the
department
and
saying
will
we
really
get
to
keep
our
reimbursement
for
this
facility.
but
it
was
always
open
to
the
state
to
seek
clarification,
and
in
fact,
it
didn't
do
it
until
it
had
expended
substantial
funds
at
this
facility,
and
then
raised
the
question
of
clarification
somewhat
late,
in
our
view.
we
do
agree
with
petitioner
on
one
thing,
and
that
is
that
this
statute
is
incredibly
complex.
in
fact,
petitioner
has
said
it
far
more
often
than
i
would
have
felt
i
could
have
said
it,
but
under
these
circumstances,
we
think
that
the
court's
rules
of
deference
are
at
their
highest.
the
court
has
recognized
that
the
medicaid
statute
of
the
social
security
act
is
one
of
the
most
complicated
congress
ever
enacted.
the
secretary's
position
doesn't
have
to
be
right,
although
we
contend
that
it
is
right.
it
doesn't
even
have
to
satisfy
a
50
percent
rule
of
probably
right.
when
the
court
is
faced
with
a
statute
that's
as
complex
as
this
one,
if
the
secretary's
interpretation
is
reasonable,
even
if
it's
not
the
interpretation
that
connecticut
or
this
court
might
initially
have
adopted,
then
the
court
is
bound
to
defer
to
that
interpretation
unless
and
until
congress
says
that
that's
not
what
it
meant
to
enact.
connecticut's
arguments
really
are
quite
simple.
connecticut
says
that
these
two
facilities
can
never
cross.
an
intermediate
care
facility,
no
matter
what
it's
factual
characteristics,
can
never
be
an
institution
for
mental
diseases.
the
secretary,
on
the
other
hand,
looks,
under
her
regulation,
to
the
overall
character
of
the
facility.
the
facts
of
this
case
show
how
reasonable
the
secretary's
position
is.
middletown
haven
during
the
time
of
the
audit
in
question,
which
covered
two
years
of
patient
population
at
the
facility,
had
77
percent
of
its
patients
there
suffering
from
major
mental
illnesses.
it
had
psychiatrists
as
its
medical
staff.
its
nonmedical
staff,
including
its
cafeteria
workers,
its
janitors
were
trained
to
care
for
the
mentally
ill.
they
were
told
as
a
condition
of
being
hired
that
you
will
be
dealing
with
the
mentally
ill
and
given
in-service
training.
many
of
the
patients
could
not
live,
could
not
continue
to
live
at
middletown
haven
hospital...
excuse
me...
rest
home,
and
had
to
be
returned
rather
quickly,
one
in
the
case
of
one
day,
to
the
mental
hospital
from
which
they
had
originally
been
discharged,
which
suggests
to
us
not
that
middletown
haven
was
a
desirable
substitute
for
a
mental
hospital,
but
that
these
patients
didn't
and
weren't
able
to
leave
a
mental
hospital
in
the
first
place,
that
the
state
was
doing
exactly
what
the
testimony
shows,
which
was
using
middletown
haven
as
a
way
to
get
federal
funding
for
the
coverage
of
patients
that
it
knew
belonged
it
mental
hospitals,
but
that
it
also
knew
if
it
kept
in
mental
hospitals,
medicaid
would
not
pay
for.
ms.
kathryn
anne
oberly
it
was
not
a
mental
hospital,
but--
ms.
kathryn
anne
oberly
--that's
correct.
ms.
kathryn
anne
oberly
that's
correct.
but
some
intermediate
care
facilities
are
not
imds.
ms.
kathryn
anne
oberly
but
that's
not
the
issue
before
the
court.
and
i
want
to
stress
again
the
only
issue
is
whether
an
icf
can
ever
be
an
imd.
and
we
would
point
out
that
the
facts
of
this
case
show
that
it
would
be
quite
unreasonable
to
say
that
the
two
are
always
mutually
exclusive
no
matter
what
the
facts
are.
ms.
kathryn
anne
oberly
we
think
the
labels
are
not
material
at
all.
i
mean
a
state
should
not
be
able
to
get
around
the
restrictions
by
just
changing
the
label
of
its
facilities.
the
patients
that
are
there,
the
treatment
they're
receiving,
the
staff,
where
they
come
from,
where
the
patients
go
when
they
leave...
all
of
those
factors
are
relevant
in
determining
what
is
an
institution
for
mental
diseases,
not
the
label.
but
again,
we
don't
have
to
decide
in
this
case
how
to
apply
the
factors.
we
only
decide
whether
looking
at
factors
as
opposed
to
labels
is
an
appropriate
way
for
the
secretary
to
proceed.
ms.
kathryn
anne
oberly
that's
correct,
your
honor,
and
that's
why
it's
facilities.
i
mean
medicaid
pays
for
services
in
facilities;
that
this
by
virtue
of
its
characterization
as
an
imd
becomes
an
ineligible
facility.
now,
those
patients
who
are
not
suffering
from
mental
disabilities
can
get
medicaid
coverage
in
a
different
facility,
and
in
fact
connecticut
moved
them
to
facilities
that
are
called
general
icfs
or
general
skilled
nursing
facilities,
and
they're
getting
coverage
there
presumably.
they
could
not
get
coverage
had
they
remained
at
middletown
haven.
ms.
kathryn
anne
oberly
no.
it
just
suggests
that
there's
a
limitation,
as
the
court
recognized
in
general
terms
in
o'bannon
v.
town
court
nursing
home,
that
there
are
general
limitations
on
the
types
of
facilities
the
medicaid
patients
have
access
to.
they
will
get
coverage.
mentally
ill
medicaid
patients
can
get
coverage
in
the
psychiatric
word
of
a
general
hospital.
the
statute
does
not
exclude
all
treatment
for
the
mentally
ill,
even
those
under
65,
but
it
does
limit
the
types
of
facilities
that
medicaid
will
pay
for,
and
that's
all
that's
involved
in
this
case
is
whether
they
put
in...
these
patients
have
been
put
in
a
facility
where
congress
expressed
an
intent
not
to
pay
for
that
type
of
facility.
the
statutory
language
we
think
clearly
supports
the
secretary
as
well
as
the
common
sense
aspect
of
the
facts
of
this
case.
the
imd
exclusion,
as
mr.
miller
has
pointed
out,
is
repeated
in
several
parenthetical
phrases
in
section
1396(a)...
excuse
me...
1396(d)(a)
in
about
five
different
places
in
that
section.
the
exclusion
appears
not
just
after
the
provision
relating
to
inpatient
hospital
services,
which
is
where
you
would
expect
it
to
appear
and
only
where
you
would
expect
it
to
appear
if
we
were
talking
simply
about
mental
hospitals,
but
it
also
appears
in
the
section
following
the
definition
of
skilled
nursing
facility
services.
it
appears
in
the
definition...
in
the
section
defining
intermediate
care
facility
services.
it
appears
in
two
other
places
in
the
statute
where
it
authorizes
these
services
for
the
elderly
and
where
it
prohibits
the
services
for
those
under
65.
in
fact,
it
appears
in
five
different
sections,
subsections
of
the
same
part
of
the
statute.
connecticut's
answer
to
this
parenthetical
clause
on
which
the
government
does
indeed
rely
quite
heavily
doesn't
make
sense
to
us,
and
we
think
it
leads
to
absurd
results.
connecticut's
position
is
that
if
icf
services
are
provided
in
a
mental
hospital,
what
we
all
would
agree
is
a
mental
hospital,
then
those
services
cannot
be
paid
for
or
covered
under
medicaid.
on
the
other
hand,
connecticut
contends
that
if
icf
services
are
provided
in
a
freestanding
icf,
a
separate
building,
then
medicaid
should
pay
for
them.
ms.
kathryn
anne
oberly
the
50
percent
figure,
which
i
stress
again
is
not
before
the
court--
ms.
kathryn
anne
oberly
--and
is
not
determinative,
was
first
adopted--
ms.
kathryn
anne
oberly
--it
was
first
adopted
i
believe
in
either
1975
or
1976,
again
before
middletown
haven
opened,
as
one
of
eight
to
ten
criteria
that
hhs
auditors
should
look
at
when
they
went
to
examine
particular
facilities.
ms.
kathryn
anne
oberly
if
you
assume
the
answer
to
the
case
in
their
favor,
it
makes
sense.
ms.
kathryn
anne
oberly
but
what
i
would
like
to
point
out
is
the
anomalous
results
that
flow
from
their
reading
that
we
don't
think
congress
could
have
intended.
first
of
all,
under
their
reading,
you
could
have
a
mental
hospital
take...
let's
say
it's
seven
stories
high,
and
it
decides
to
convert
the
fourth
floor
of
its
hospital
into
an
icf
ward.
connecticut
would
agree
without
any
hesitation
at
all
that
the
patients
on
that
fourth
floor
receiving
icf
services
are
not
eligible
for
medicaid
coverage.
now,
let's
say
the
mental
hospital
decides
to
take
the
whole
fourth
floor
and
move
it
to
a
different
building,
a
new
facility
that
they
called
middletown
haven
rest
home.
it
provides
the
same
care
and
services
to
the
patients
that
they
were
previously
getting
on
the
fourth
floor
of
the
mental
hospital.
all
of
a
sudden,
under
connecticut's
interpretation
of
the
statute,
those
people
become
eligible
for
medicaid
coverage.
to
us
and
to
the
court
of
appeals
that's
an
irrational,
artificial
distinction
that
finds
absolutely
no
support
in
the
legislative
history.
ms.
kathryn
anne
oberly
you
can
if
you
get
separate
certification
for
them.
ms.
kathryn
anne
oberly
but
that
doesn't
mean
you'll
get
medicaid
compensation
for
them
if
they're
still
in
a
mental
hospital.
another
problem
we
think
with
connecticut's
reading...
pardon?
ms.
kathryn
anne
oberly
i
hope
it's
not
anything
i
said.
but
another
problem
we
think
with
connecticut's
interpretation
of
the
statute,
of
the
parenthetical
clauses
is
that
if
you
will
look
at
all
of
those
provisions
in
1396(d),
they
deal
with
covered
medicaid
services.
they
deal
with
eyeglasses,
they
deal
with
physician
services.
they
also
deal
with
residential
services
such
as
in
skilled
nursing
facilities,
hospitals
or
intermediate
care
facility
services.
the
parenthetical
we're
concerned
about
only
appears
following
the
definition
of
residential
services.
it
doesn't
appear
following
physician
services
or
following
eyeglasses
services.
to
us
it
seems
only
logical
that
the
place
you're
going
to
look
for
icf
services
is
in
an
icf.
if
you're
looking
for
doctor
services,
you
go
to
a
doctor's
office.
you
might
find
those
services
somewhere
else,
and
it's
possible
you'll
find
icf
services
in
a
mental
hospital.
but
we
don't
think
that
it's
logical
to
assume
that
congress
would
have
written
a
statute
that
focuses
on
the
quite
unique
and
unusual
situation
of
when
someone
is
looking
for
services
that
is
not
normally
set
up
to
provide
that
type
of
service.
and
that
is
another
effect
of
reading
the
parenthetical
the
way
connecticut
reads
it
is
that
congress
has
taken
great
pains
to
repeat
this
parenthetical
to
cover
a
situation
that
will
hardly
ever
arise.
and
at
the
same
time
it's
found
it
unnecessary
to
include
the
parenthetical
in
the
situation
of
services
that
have
nothing
to
do
with
residence,
residential
facilities,
such
as
eyeglasses,
therapy,
x-rays.
so
that
the
structure
of
that
whole
section
1396(d)
suggests
to
us
that
this
parenthetical
does
mean
that
an
icf
or
a
skilled
nursing
facility
can
be
an
imd
if
the
facts
of
the
particular
case
warrant
that
conclusion.
ms.

anne
oberly
my
understanding
is
the
certification
comes
from
the
state.
it's
a
cooperative
state-federal
program.
the
state
does--
ms.
kathryn
anne
oberly
--the
state
does
the
certifying.
i
think
that
hhs
retains
power
to
say
we
disagree
with
the
certification.
but
basically
it's
a
state
certification.
the
money
goes
to
the
state,
which
in
turn
pays
it
to
the
vendor,
which
in
this
case
would
be
middletown
haven.
ms.
kathryn
anne
oberly
that's
correct.
ms.
kathryn
anne
oberly
that's
correct.
unless
you're
dealing
with
what
we
all
concede
is
a
psychiatric
hospital
where
there
is
no
dispute
from
the
beginning
that
that's
an
imd.
but
in
the
case
of
these
sort
of
hybrid
facilities,
it
couldn't
be
until
after
the
facility
had
opened
and
had
some
patients,
and
you
could
tell
what
went
on
at
the
facility.
ms.
kathryn
anne
oberly
no
single
criteria
is
determinative.
the
50
percent
criteria
is
not
determinative.
no
single
one
carries
ultimate
weight.
ms.
kathryn
anne
oberly
that
we
would
disagree
with,
your
honor.
certainly
in
the
case
that
you
have
before
you
and
in
the
case
of
all
the
audits
that
were
before
the
grant
appeals
board
in
this
case,
because
they
weren't
even
borderline
cases.
we're
talking
about
facilities
that
had
patient
populations
ranging
from
77
to
90
percent
mental
illness
patients,
patients
that...
facilities
that
by
their
own
admission...
connecticut
doesn't
dispute
that
middletown
haven
was
a
facility
specializing
in
the
care
of
the
mentally
ill.
ms.
kathryn
anne
oberly
thank
you.
i'd
like
to
use
my
remaining
time
to
address
some
of
connecticut's
policy
arguments.
connecticut
doesn't
really
rely
on
the
statute.
instead,
what
they're
relying
on
is
extensive
legislative
history
that
shows
a
quite
sincere
and
detailed
concern
on
the
part
of
congress
for
the
elderly
and
for
the
health
costs,
both
mental
and
nonmental,
of
the
elderly.
we
find
it
somewhat
hard
to
believe
that
congress
would
have
devoted
as
much
time
as
it
did...
and
it
was
a
lot...
to
discussing
the
health
problems
and
costs
of
the
elderly
and
then,
without
uttering
a
single
word,
extend
virtually
the
same
coverage
to
the
patients
in
the
age
group
we're
talking
about
here,
between
the
ages
of
21
and
64.
we
also,
i
might
mention
as
an
aside,
find
it
somewhat
ironic
that
for
connecticut
to
rely
on
this
legislative
history
relating
to
the
elderly,
because
congress
made
coverage
in
mental
institutions
optional
with
the
states,
even
for
those
over
65.
connecticut
has
chosen
as
a
part
of
its
state
plan
in
exercising
that
option
not
to
provide
icf
or
skilled
nursing
facility
services
for
the
elderly
under
medicaid.
and
so
here
we
have
a
state
that
has
not
done
what
congress
was
most
anxious
to
encourage.
it
was
not
required
to
do
it.
that
was
its
choice.
but
at
the
same
time
it's
here
asking
this
court
to
have
the
federal
government
reimburse
it
for
coverage
for
a
different
age
group
of
patients
on
whom
congress
has
not
focused
attention.
in
the
end
we
think
that
the
issue
before
the
court
is
one
for
congress.
we
think
our
interpretation
of
the
statute
is
correct,
but
if
there's
any
doubt
about
the
matter,
it's
quite
clear
that
congress
has
approached
the
entire
subject
of
increased
federal
funding
for
the
mentally
ill
on
a
step-by-step
basis.
it
started
off
with
basically
no
federal
funding
for
residential
services.
it
did
provide
cash
assistance,
but
in
1935,
which
is
what
connecticut
talks
about
in
its
reply
brief,
it
was
$15
a
month,
which
is
clearly
not
enough
to
support
anyone
in
a
residential
facility.
and
instead,
congress
has
gone
step
by
step,
first
removing
the
exclusion
for
the
elderly;
then
removing
the
exclusion
for
children
under
21;
adding
the
mentally
retarded
after
reaching
the
conclusion
that
they're
in
a
different
medical
category
than
the
mentally
ill.
but
congress
hasn't
taken
the
step
that
connecticut
is
asking
this
court
to
take
for
it,
and
we
think
that
that
decision
is
one
that
properly
belongs
to
congress.
and
in
light
of
the
cost
we're
talking
about...
and
we
are
not
in
this
case
talking
about
the
$1
1/2
million
disallowance
at
issue
for
connecticut;
we're
talking
about
the
future
cost
of
all
states
who
might
seek
reimbursement
under
this
program
in
the
future.
and
i
can't
give
a
dollar
amount
on
that,
but
it's
clearly
quite
substantial.
ms.
kathryn
anne
oberly
no,
your
honor,
i
don't.
i
think
that
when
faced
with
the
facts
that
it
has
before
it
that
the
only
fiscally
responsible
position
for
the
department
to
take
in
order
to
carry
out
congress'
intent
is
the
position
it's
taken,
because
congress
has
been
throughout,
it
repeatedly
said
that
it
viewed
the
cost
of
long-term
care
for
the
mentally
ill
as
a
state
responsibility.
and
it's
chipped
away
at
that
step
by
step,
but
it
hasn't
taken
the
step
that
connecticut
is
asking
the
court
to
take.
so
that
i
think
the
agency
would
be
running
contrary
to
years
of
congressional
intent
of
assuming
that
this
was
a
state
fiscal
responsibility
if
it
were
to
take
connecticut's
position.
also,
i
think
it's
quite
significant
that
just
last
summer,
the
summer
of
1984,
congress
looked
at
the
very
provisions
of
the
statute
we're
looking
at
today.
every
place
that
the
parenthetical
exclusion
for
institutions
for
mental
diseases
appears
in
the
statute
there
previously
also
appeared
an
exclusion
for
institutions
for
tuberculosis.
in
1984
congress
removed
the
tb
exclusion.
that
wasn't
any
great
act
of
generosity
on
congress'
part.
congress
knew
that
tuberculosis
is
simply
not
much
of
a
problem
in
the
united
states
any
more.
it
doesn't
require
long-term
care.
it
responds
to
antibiotics.
the
patients
are
ambulatory.
and
so
to
bring
tb
coverage
within
the
scope
of
medicaid
was
not
saddling
the
federal
government
with
a
large
fiscal
responsibility.
but
when
congress
examined
that
very
same
parenthetical
and
left
the
imd
exclusion
untouched,
we
think
again
that
that's
another
strong
indication
that
unless
and
until
congress
says
something
different
about
the
secretary's
interpretation,
the
court
should
uphold
it.
one
final
point
is
that
extending
coverage
to
the
group
we're
talking
about
here,
the
mentally
ill
between
21
and
64
in
icfs
and
skilled
nursing
facilities,
would
be
particularly
inappropriate
because
when
congress
has
extended
mental
health
coverage,
it's
done
so
with
strict
cost
and
therapeutic
efficiency
controls.
for
the
elderly
and
for
the
children
and
for
the
mentally
retarded
it's
written
into
the
statutes
provisions
that
require
that
those
patients
be
getting
effective
treatment,
that
those
patients
be
getting
treatment
that's
designed
to
lead
to
their
eventual
release
and
return
to
community
living.
there
are
no
such
standards
for
the
patients
that
connecticut
seeks
to
bring
within
the
scope
of
medicaid
coverage.
there
are
general
standards
for
patients
in
icfs
and
in
skilled
nursing
facilities,
but
none
that
pertain
specifically
to
mental
illness.
and
with
congress'
unquestioned
concern
for
cost
effectiveness,
it
seems
to
us
highly
unlikely
that
it
would
have
intended
this
sort
of
open-ended
coverage
for
the
group
connecticut
is
talking
about
without
also
providing
the
same
cost
effective
and
treatment-oriented
standards
that
it's
provided
for
the
other
groups
that
we
all
agree
are
covered
by
the
statute.
thank
you.
