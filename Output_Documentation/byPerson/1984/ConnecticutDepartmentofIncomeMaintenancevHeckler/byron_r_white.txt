justice
white
mr.
miller,
do
you
think
you
should
win
the
case
if
you
can
show
that
your
reading
is
the
better
reading,
or
is
the
only
reading
that
is
possible?
justice
white
well,
apparently
the
government
has
great
difficulty
concluding
that
it
means
what
you
say
it
does.
justice
white
yes.
justice
white
are
you
saying
there
is
just
no
room
in
this
language
for
the
government's
construction?
justice
white
so
you
think
the
court
should
just
make
its
own
independent...
take
its
own
independent
look
at
the
statute
and
figure
out
what
it
means
without
regard
to
what
the
agency
says.
justice
white
--when
were
the
intermediate
care
facilities
covered?
justice
white
'67.
justice
white
'71.
justice
white
well,
you
have
to...
you
certainly
are
making
this
argument,
though,
to
say
that
this
definition
seems
to
foreclose
or
tends
to
foreclose
defining
this
kind
of
facility
that
you
represent
as
an
imd.
justice
white
they
say
that...
in
effect
they
say
that
because
this
facility
serves
such
a
high
percentage
of
mental
patients,
it
is,
in
effect,
an
imd.
justice
white
yes.
justice
white
but
they
certainly
don't
claim
it's
a
psychiatric
hospital.
justice
white
yes.
justice
white
but
i
take
it
you
certainly
concede
that
middletown
was
not
a
mental
hospital.
justice
white
it
was
an
intermediate
care
facility.
justice
white
but
also
an
imd,
is
that
it?
justice
white
right.
justice
white
do
you
suppose...
i
take
it,
then,
you
don't
think
there's
room
in
this
statute
for
the
department
to
take
a
different
view,
to
take
connecticut's
view?
