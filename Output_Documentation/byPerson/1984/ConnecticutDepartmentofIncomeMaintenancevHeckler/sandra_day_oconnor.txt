justice
o'connor
may
i
inquire
about
the
consequences
of
a
ruling
adverse
to
your
position?
if
the
government
is
correct
in
its
view
of
this
statute,
would
it
be
possible
for
states
to
simply
scatter
mental
patients
around
among
the
intermediate
care
facilities
and
just
not
put
as
many
of
them
in
a
single
facility,
as
existed
here,
and
succeed
in
having
reimbursement
by
that
device?
justice
o'connor
yeah.
and
so
we're
not
really
talking
about
the
money
so
much
as
the
inconvenience
perhaps
of
having
to
scatter
them?
justice
o'connor
what
do
you
know
about
the
practical
application
of
the
government's
test?
do
they
look
to
see
whether
50
percent
or
more
of
the
patients
are
mental
cases,
or
30
percent,
or
how
is
that
being
applied
in
your
experience?
justice
o'connor
that's
true,
but
i
think
it's
of
general
interest
to
know
whether
the
states
can
just
scatter
the
mentally
ill
around
in
more
facilities
that
presumably
will
have
less
specialized
staff
to
take
care
of
them,
and
if
that
satisfies
the
law
in
your
view.
justice
o'connor
perhaps.
justice
o'connor
ms.
oberly,
is
it
correct
that
the
government
would
be
seeking
to
recoup
vast
sums
of
money
from
the
states
if
your
position
is
sustained
here?
justice
o'connor
well,
was
the
interpretation
of
connecticut
widespread
among
the
states?
justice
o'connor
was
the
interpretation
placed
on
the
statute--
justice
o'connor
--by
connecticut
the
same
interpretation
most
states
placed
on
it?
justice
o'connor
has
the
department,
the
government,
hhs,
ever
taken
a
different
view
of
the
proper
meaning
of
the
statute?
justice
o'connor
was
the
government
ever
asked
by
states
for
an
interpretation
of
this
regulation?
i
mean
are
there
letters
that
have
been
sent
out
giving
different
interpretations?
justice
o'connor
--ms.
oberly,
what
year
was
it
that
the
department
of
health
and
human
services
adopted
its
criteria,
including
the
50
percent
figure?
justice
o'connor
yes,
i
know.
justice
o'connor
i
asked
what
year
it
was--
justice
o'connor
on
the
practical
level
do
you
know
how
it
works,
ms.
oberly?
in
order
to
be
eligible
for
reimbursement
of
medicaid
funding,
does
an
icf
apply
to
some
office
of
hhs
and
ask
for
certification
with
that
status
as
an
icf?
justice
o'connor
they'd
apply
through
the
state
who
acts
for
the
federal
government,
in
other
words,
in
making
a
certification?
justice
o'connor
and,
of
course,
no
application
is
ever
made
to
be
certified
as
an
imd.
that's
a
category
that--
justice
o'connor
--would
be
determined
by
the
federal
government
following
an
audit,
presumably?
justice
o'connor
and
the
listed
criteria
are
imposed
flexibly
by
the
federal
government?
it
could
be
any
combination
of
the
listed
eight
or
nine
criteria?
justice
o'connor
so
an
icf
would
certainly
have
no
very
comfortable
basis
for
knowing
whether
a
later
audit
would
be--
justice
o'connor
--might
there
be
other
facilities
around
the
country
where
it
would
be
quite
an
uncertain
question?
