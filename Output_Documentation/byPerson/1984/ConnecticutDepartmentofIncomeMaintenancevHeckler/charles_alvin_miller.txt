mr.
charles
alvin
miller
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
presents
questions
as
to
the
meaning
of
terms
in
the
medicaid
law,
and
the
state
of
connecticut
is
grateful
for
the
court
for
hearing
its
case
today.
the
outcome
of
this
case
is
unusually
important
because
of
its
bearing
on
the
future
care
of
needy
mentally
ill
in
the
united
states,
and
because
of
its
impact
on
the
states
and
their
position
as
partners
with
the
federal
government
in
carrying
out
the
medicaid
program.
two
statutory
terms
must
be
construed
in
this
case.
the
first
is
the
term
imd.
that
is
an
exception
in
the
statute
that
limits
the
coverage
that
otherwise
would
be
extended
for
certain
medical
services.
the
second
term
is
icf.
this
is
one
category
of
facility
that
is
covered
by
the
medicaid
program,
and
it
is
defined
in
the
statute
to
mean
a
facility
that
provides
a
specified
level
of
service
to
persons
requiring
it
because
of
their
mental
or
physical
condition.
and
the
ultimate
question
presented
is
the
extent
to
which,
if
at
all,
the
imd
exception
limits
medicaid
coverage
for
icfs.
the
briefs
of
the
parties
have
treated
that
question
exhaustively,
and
in
so
doing
have
exposed
the
complexity
of
the
medicaid
laws
and
the
subtlety
of
many
of
its
standards
and
distinctions.
mr.
charles
alvin
miller
yes,
justice
o'connor,
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
mentally
ill
that
would
be
the
principal
consequence.
mr.
charles
alvin
miller
i
wouldn't
call
it
inconvenience.
the
principal
impact
is
on
the
care
that
would
be
given
to
mentally
ill
people.
as
the
record
shows
in
this
case,
because
middletown
haven
was
recognized
by
everyone
involved
as
being
a
very
fine
facility,
a
facility
that
specializes
in
the
care
of
people
with
mental
conditions,
it
does
a
much
better
job
for
them,
even
at
this
intermediate
level,
than
a
facility
which
is
treating
people
for
a
broad
range
of
conditions,
including
the
many
physical
conditions
associated
with
those
who
need
some
sort
of
residential
care,
albeit
not
the
intensive
care
of
hospitals.
so
that
is
a
major
distinction,
and
the
evidence
has
shown
that
in
this
facility
and
others
like
it
that
specialize
in
the
care
of
the
mentally
ill,
those
people
get
the
kind
of
care
they
need
and
they
cannot
get
elsewhere.
mr.
charles
alvin
miller
well,
we
have
the
experience
of
the
present
case
and
the
three
companion
cases
that
started
out
with
them
at
the
administrative
level.
and
there
are
some
other
cases
that
are
working
their
way
through
the
system
now.
the
answer
is
that,
to
begin
with,
the
government
has
applied
a
50
percent
litmus
test.
it
has
a
number
of
other
standards
as
well
that
it
seeks
to
apply.
all
of
those
standards
are
designed
to
find
out
whether
the
facility
in
question
is
functioning
as
an
alternative
to
the
care
of
persons
in
mental
hospitals.
and
that's
one
of
the
points
i
wanted
to
make
in
the
argument
this
morning,
that
that
set
of
criteria
is
fundamentally
flawed
in
the
sense
that
it
looks
to
apply
a
distinction
contrary
to
what
the
statute
applies.
and
as
i
will
try
to
say
later,
the
whole
point
of
the
statute
here
which
i
am
going
to
refer
to,
specifically
the
long
amendment,
was
designed
to
encourage
the
development
of
alternatives
to
mental
hospitals
and
to
provide
funding
for
the
care
of
people
who
are
placed
in
these
alternatives
to
the
extent
the
alternative
types
of
facilities
are
covered
by
the
statute.
not
all
alternatives
to
mental
hospitals
are
covered
by
the
medicaid
program.
the
most
common
alternative
is
send
someone
home
and
have
care
in
the
home
or
in
a
community-type
facility.
but
some
alternatives
are
covered
by
medicaid,
and
nursing
homes,
either
at
the
skilled
level
or
the
intermediate
care
level,
are
two
that
are
covered.
and
we
believe
the
statute
makes
fairly
evident
that
that
is
exactly
the
way
congress
wanted
people
who
are
mentally
ill
to
be
treated
where
appropriate.
i
said
at
the
outset
that
the
statute
was
complex,
and
it
is.
it
has
been
described
as
byzantine
and
as
an
aggravated
assault
on
the
english
language.
all
that
is
true.
but
those
sorts
of
descriptions
ought
not
be
allowed
to
obscure
what
is
the
intended
meaning
and
purpose
of
the
provisions
that
are
under
consideration
in
this
case.
and
in
that
connection
there
are
two
general
propositions
that
have
a
central
bearing
on
the
case
that
i
would
like
to
make.
the
first
is
that
contrary
to
the
position
taken
by
the
court
below
and
by
the
department
of
health
and
human
services
in
its
briefs
here,
congress
has
not
broadly
excluded
the
mentally
ill
from
the
benefits
of
public
assistance
under
the
social
security
act
programs,
by
which
i
refer
to
medicaid
and
the
financial
assistance
programs
that
preceded
it
in
the
statute.
it
is
not
true
that
the
mentally
ill
as
a
class
were
left
solely
to
the
states
for
aid
in
meeting
their
basic
subsistence
and
health
needs.
the
mentally
ill,
if
they
satisfy
the
tests
for
financial
eligibility
categorical
membership,
have
always
qualified
for
the
financial
assistance
provided
by
the
act.
that
includes
not
only
the
elderly
mentally
ill,
but
also
the
mentally
impaired
when
the
statute
was
amended
in
1950
to
provide
assistance
for
those
who
were
disabled.
and
when
the
separate
medical
assistance
program
for
the
aged
was
adopted
in
1960...
that's
the
immediate
precursor
to
medicaid...
the
elderly
mentally
ill,
like
others
who
qualified
as
needy,
were
eligible
for
payment
of
their
services
such
as
doctors,
hospital
services,
and
clinic
services,
and
drugs
and
all
the
other
items
listed
in
the
statute,
and
that
carried
over
into
the
medicaid
law
which
was
enacted
in
1965.
now,
there
was
an
exemption...
an
exception,
i
should
say,
to
this
eligibility
for
federally-supported
assistance.
beginning
in
1950,
a
resident
in
an
institution
for
mental
disease,
imd,
was
not
eligible
for
any
of
the
services
that
i
described.
the
scope
of
that
exception
is
the
issue
to
be
decided
here.
but
this
brief
review
that
i
have
just
given
of
the
other
forms
of
assistance
that
are
available
under
the
law,
including
medical
assistance
available
to
the
mentally
ill,
should
show
that
the
scope
of
the
imd
exception
cannot
be
decided
by
an
assumption
that
congress
intended
to
treat
the
mentally
ill
as
solely
a
state
responsibility.
the
social
security
act
is
animated
by
no
such
assumption.
and
the
contrary
premise
of
the
court
below
and
of
the
department
here
cannot
substitute
for
an
objective
analysis
of
the
intended
scope
of
the
imd
exception.
and
so
the
absence
of
a
broad
policy
to
exclude
the
mentally
ill
from
the
benefits
of
the
public
assistance
program
leads
me
to
my
second
general
proposition,
which
is
that
the
imd
exception
is
a
facility
specific
limitation
predicated
not
only
on
cost
concerns,
but
also
upon
a
deep
hostility
to
state
mental
hospitals.
by
mid-century
these
enormous
and
remote
and
often
demeaning
institutions
were
broadly
perceived
as
the
antithesis
of
how
the
mentally
ill
should
be
treated
in
this
country,
and
the
animus
towards
these
facilities
was
reflected
in
the...
many
ways,
including
the
seminal
report
of
the
joint
commission
on
mental
illness
and
health
that
we've
referred
to
in
our
brief.
that's
the
study
that
was
commissioned
by
the
congress,
and
which
was
reported
in
1960,
and
which
was
followed
by
the
principal
legislation
that
is
before
the
court
today.
so
by
the
time
the
medicaid
law
was
enacted
in
1965,
there
was
a
clear
consensus,
not
only
in
the
congress
but
also
in
the
profession
and
the
best
thinking
around
the
country
that
state
mental
hospitals
as
they
then
existed
were
outmoded,
and
that
successful
care
of
the
mentally
ill
depended
upon
the
development
of
more
suitable
facilities
and
treatment
techniques.
and
that's
the
setting
in
which
the
imd
provisions
of
the
medicaid
law
were
adopted.
now,
with
those
two
general
propositions
as
background,
let
me
turn
to
the
specifics
of
the
task
at
hand
today,
starting
with
the
words
of
the
statute.
all
acknowledge
that
the
imd
exception
is
not
expressly
defined
in
the
statute,
but
the
statutory
terms
do
tell
us
enough
to
resolve
this
case,
because
the
imd
exception
was
part
of
a
group
of
provisions
that
have
become
known
as
the
long
amendment.
that
amendment
includes
the
exception
to
the
exception
that
permits
coverage
in
imds,
in
mental
hospitals
for
the
elderly,
those
over
65
years
of
age.
that
was
a
change
made
when
medicaid
was
adopted
in
1965.
but
the
long
amendment
also
includes
certain
conditions
that
attach
to
that
new
coverage,
and
most
specifically,
there
is
the
requirement
that
the
states
who
opt
for
such
coverage
adopt
comprehensive
plans
for
the
care
of
the
mentally
ill,
and
the
statute
specifically
lists
nursing
homes
as
one
of
the
alternatives
to
imds
that
are
to
be
considered
and
encouraged.
this
is,
using
the
u.s.
code
designation,
it's
section
1396(a)(a)(21).
any
statute
with
numbers
like
that
is
necessarily
complex.
and
it
is...
but
that
statute
is
strong
proof
that
on
its
face,
the
congress
did
not
intend
the
term
imd
to
include
nursing
homes.
now,
the
department
in
its
briefs
points
to
parenthetical
clauses
in
the
listing
of
covered
services
in
the
statute
to
support
its
claim
that
the
imd
exception
goes
beyond
mental
hospitals
and
embraces
other
types
of
facilities,
specifically
skilled
nursing
homes
and
intermediate
care
facilities,
and
it's
the
latter
that's
involved
in
this
case.
we've
shown
in
our
brief
that
these
parenthetical
clauses
are
to
skilled
nursing
or
intermediate
care
levels
of
service,
and
that
distinction
is
very
critical.
it
refers,
those
clauses
do,
to
that
type
of
service
when
offered
in
a
mental
hospital
setting,
as
frequently
those
services
are.
mr.
charles
alvin
miller
justice
white,
i'm
familiar
with
the
doctrine
of
deference,
to
which
i
think
you're
alluding,
and
i
suppose
if
this
were
a
51-49
case
we'd
have
some
deference
on
the
scales
for
the
government
which
would
made
our
case
more
difficult.
but
i
don't
think
this
is
just
a
case
of
the
better
reading.
when
one
looks
not
only
at
the
words
of
the
statute,
including
the
section
that
distinguishes
imds
from
nursing
homes,
but
also
the
broad
setting
in
which
this
whole
context
arose,
it's
not
difficult
to
conclude
what
congress
meant
when
it
used
the
term
imd.
at
least
it's
not
difficult
to
conclude
what
it
didn't
mean
to
include.
mr.
charles
alvin
miller
yes.
i
guess
that
causes
disputes.
mr.
charles
alvin
miller
this
court
has
never
taken
the
view
that
just
because
the
government
takes
one
side
of
an
issue
that
this
is
enough
reason
to--
mr.
charles
alvin
miller
--i
wouldn't
say
that,
mr.
justice,
because
as
i
said
before,
this
statute
is
so
complex
and
the
language
of
it
in
many
respects
to
obtuse
that
there's
room
for
any
kind
of
interpretation
of
it,
depending
on
how
you
read
it.
what
we've
tried
to
do
is
not
only
analyze
the
specific
language
of
the
wording
of
the
statute
here,
but
also
try
to
understand
what
was
the
congress
getting
at
here,
what
were
the
concepts
and
the
purposes
and
the
meaning
behind
this
collection
of
words,
three
or
four
pages
of
one
that
consists
of
one
sentence
in
the
statute.
and
when
you
conclude
that
analysis,
we
think
it's
not
a
close
case,
even
just
on
the
meaning
of
the
term
imd,
which
is
all
i'm
focusing
on
right
now.
mr.
charles
alvin
miller
i
don't
think
the
court
would
ever
construe
the
statute
without
regard
to
what
the
agency
says.
in
fact,
much
of
our
argument--
mr.
charles
alvin
miller
--lies
in
this--
mr.
charles
alvin
miller
--i'm
asking
you
in
the
end
not
to
accept
it.
i'm
saying
that,
as
in
a
moment
i'll
come
to
the
regulations
and
will
show,
i
believe,
that
when
the
statute
was
first
passed
that
the
agency
adopted
the
interpretation
we
now
espouse.
it
is
only
the
later
administrative
interpretation
that
we
ask
you
to
reject.
i
hesitate
to
say
disregard
it.
not
disregard
it
initially
but
disregard
it
ultimately.
and
we
in
a
sense
are
asking
you
to
do
what
this
court
last
term
in
the
security
industry
case
said
it
does
when
it
approaches
statutes
of
this
kind,
and
a
reviewing
court
must
reject
administrative
constructions
of
a
statute--
mr.
charles
alvin
miller
--if
inconsistent
with
the
statutory
mandate
or
that
frustrate
the
purpose.
mr.
charles
alvin
miller
they
were
added
to
the
statute
in
1967.
mr.
charles
alvin
miller
but
not
the
medicaid
provisions.
they
were
added
to
medicaid
in
1971.
mr.
charles
alvin
miller
yes.
in
both
cases
after
medicaid's
original
enactment
of
1965.
i
wanted
to
complete
the
point
i
was
making
about
the
parenthetical
clauses
in
the
definitions
of
hospital,
skilled
nursing
and
intermediate
care
services
of
the
statute,
because
that's
what
the
government
relies
upon
most.
the
department
says
that
our
view
of
the
statute,
connecticut's
view,
doesn't
give
effect
to
all
the
words
of
the
statute,
and
particularly
those
words.
we
think
it's
the
department's
view
that
is
subject
to
that
criticism,
because
its
reading
of
these
parenthetical
clauses
makes
them
redundant
of
the
imd
exception
that
appears
at
the
end
of
the
listing
of
all
these
services.
according
to
the
department's
view,
those
parenthetical
clauses
mean
the
same
thing
as
the
general
imd
exception
that
comes
at
the
end.
that's
not
what
was
meant
by
the
congress,
and
it's
relatively
clear
when
one
reads
the
legislative
record
what
was
meant
by
those
parenthetical
clauses.
they
were
not
in
the
lists
of
services
in
the
original
medical
assistance
for
the
aged
program,
the
precursor
to
medicaid,
that
was
adopted
in
1960,
nor
were
they
in
the
house
version
of
the
medicaid
law
that
was
enacted
in
1965.
that,
by
the
way,
is
the
version
that
president
johnson
referred
to
as
the
great
breakthrough
in
the
establishment
of
national
health
programs
in
this
country.
these--
mr.
charles
alvin
miller
--that's
correct.
mr.
charles
alvin
miller
the
'67
amendment
provided
that
financial
assistance
could
be
provided
to
residents
of
intermediate
care
facilities,
so
that
if
a
person
qualified
for
financial
aid
under
the
elderly
or
disabled
line
program--
mr.
charles
alvin
miller
--yeah.
then
they
would
be
covered
even
though
they
were
resident
in
those
facilities.
in
1971
those
facilities
were
brought
under
medicaid
in
a
category
of
service,
a
category
of
medical
service
described
as
intermediate
care
facility
services,
was
brought
under
the
statute
which
wasn't
there
before.
mr.
charles
alvin
miller
yes,
sir,
justice
stevens.
it
was
1971,
because
the
coverage
that's
at
issue
here
is
the
medical
care--
mr.
charles
alvin
miller
--given
to
these
people.
mr.
charles
alvin
miller
no.
the
'72
amendment?
mr.
charles
alvin
miller
there
was
a
'72
amendment,
but
we're
not
relying
upon
it,
and
it's
not
pertinent
here.
the
clauses
in
question...
and
i'll
try
to
finish
up
on
these
clauses...
they
were
added
by
the
senate
finance
committee
the
same
place
where
the
proposal
to
cut
back
on
the
imd
exception
was
initiated,
and
the
senate
report
explains
those
clauses.
it
says
that
they
were
put
in
to
make
clear
that
the
new
type
of
service
that
was
being
authorized
for
people
over
65
in
imds
was
not
mandatory.
a
state
didn't
have
to
do
it.
it
was
only
optional.
that
was
an
important
addition,
because
otherwise,
under
the
statute,
hospital
and
skilled
nursing
services
are
mandatory.
so
this
was...
and
they
remain
mandatory
except
for
those
over
65
in
imds.
now,
the
statute...
the
department's
brief
just
ignored
that
evidence.
it's
in
our
brief
at
page
67.
and
i
think
it
not
only
explains
what
congress
meant,
it
supports
our
reading
of
the
statute,
and
it
invalidates
the
department's
reading.
i'd
like
to
turn
now
to
the
regulations
that
were
adopted.
justice
white,
you
referred
to
them,
i
think,
when
you
asked
me
a
question.
after
medicaid
was
enacted
in
1965,
the
department
set
about
to
put
out
regulations
in
the
form
of
a
handbook,
as
that's
the
form
that
regulations
took
at
that
time.
since
the
law
did
now
permit
coverage
in
imds
for
people
over
65,
it
became
necessary
for
the
department
to
define
just
what
an
imd
was,
and
it
did
so.
and
in
the
1966
regulation
it
defined
an
imd,
and
it
said
to
be
an
imd
you
had
to
qualify
as
a
psychiatric
hospital,
and
it
recited
the
medicare
definitions
of
psychiatric
hospital,
and
if
you
qualified
for
that,
you
were
an
imd.
that
seemed
to
us
to
be
pretty
strong
evidence
that
the
contemporaneous
understanding
was
that
an
imd
meant
a
mental
hospital
and
not
a
nursing
facility.
now,
the
department's
answer
to
this
is
that
the
regulation
confining
imds
to
qualifying
psychiatric
hospitals
was
eventually
changed.
i
don't
think,
however,
that
this
detracts
from
the
showing
of
the
original
understanding
of
the
scope
of
the
term
imd.
now
i'd
like
to
make
one
sort
of
a
side
comment.
in
our
reply
brief
at
page
28
we
went
further,
and
we
said
that
the
department
was
in
error
because
the
original
regulation
remained
on
the
books.
i
have
reviewed
that
regulation
again
in
its
present
form,
and
i'd
like
to
modify
that
comment
slightly.
the
format
of
the
regulation
has
been
altered.
the
provision
in
question
is
still
on
the
books.
but
there's
a
semantic
argument
that
could
be
made
now
that
it
is
not
an
exclusive
definition
of
imd.
and
so
i
do
want
to
correct
an
impression
to
the
contrary
that
our
reply
brief
most
likely
created.
i
don't
think
it's--
mr.
charles
alvin
miller
--i
think
it's
page
28
of
the
reply
brief,
yes.
and
i
was
answering
the
point
that
the
government
made
that
that
original
definition
was
no
longer
on
the
books.
it
is
on
the
books.
but
as
i
say,
i
don't
want
to
leave
the
impression
that
it
remains
an
exclusive
definition.
the
regulations
are
sufficiently
complex.
as
i
looked
at
it,
justice
white,
again,
i
could
see
that
you
could
construe
it
as
being
nonexclusive.
mr.
charles
alvin
miller
that's
correct.
mr.
charles
alvin
miller
that's
what
the
government
is
saying.
mr.
charles
alvin
miller
all
that
this
regulation
does
on
the
books
today--
mr.
charles
alvin
miller
--they
do
not
claim
it's
a
psychiatric
hospital,
but
they
treat
it
like
a
psychiatric
hospital
for
purposes
of
coverage.
mr.
charles
alvin
miller
the
government
does
rely
also
on
the
regulation
that
says
a
facility's...
whether
a
facility
is
an
imd
is
to
be
determined
by
its
"overall
character",
which
are
the
words
i
put
in
quotes.
i
just
don't
think
that
that
general
phrase
can
be
used
to
save
a
position
that's
otherwise
not
defensible.
this
not
very
helpful
standard
was
in
the
original
regulation
and
undoubtedly
designed
to
give
some
flexibility
in
applying
the
imd
exception,
and
is
of
some
help
particularly
where
it's
being
applied
to
private
mental
hospitals
which
might
not
have
been
as
easily
identifiable
as
the
traditional
state
mental
hospital.
but
flexibility
in
applying
a
definition
is
not
a
justification
for
applying
the
definition
to
a
class
of
facilities
which
were
not
intended
to
be
embraced
by
it
and
which
were
not
covered
by
the
affirmative
definition
of
the
term
imd
that
was
included
in
the
regulations
at
the
very
same
time.
just
to
summarize
on
this
aspect
of
our
argument
on
the
meaning
of
the
imd
exception,
the
wording
of
the
statute
and
the
regulations,
the
legislative
record
which
we've
tried
to
spell
out
in
our
briefs,
the
evident
statutory
purpose,
the
history
of
the
exception
to
the
social
security
act,
and
the
widely
perceived
experience
with
state
mental
hospitals
over
the
past
century
all
combine
to
demonstrate
beyond
any
real
doubt
that
the
imd
exception
was
meant
to
cover
mental
hospitals
and
only
mental
hospitals
and
certainly
not
the
kinds
of
alternative
facilities
like
nursing
homes
which
have
been
developed
as
alternatives.
these
considerations
in
our
view
alone
would
establish
the
error
of
the
court
below
in
applying
the
imd
exception
to
middletown
haven
in
connecticut.
but
to
this
we
add
the
other
side
of
the
story:
the
provisions
of
the
medicaid
act
relating
to
intermediate
care
facilities,
icfs,
the
category
into
which
middletown
haven
falls
and
which
was
added
to
medicaid,
as
i
said,
justice
stevens
in
1971.
on
both
occasions
that
the
icfs
were
recognized...
in
1967
and
then
when
they
were
brought
under
medicaid
in
1971...
they
were
defined
to
mean
places
that
provide
a
specified
level
of
treatment
for
persons
whose
mental
or
physical
conditions
requires
that
degree
of
care.
there's
no
qualification
in
this
law
to
the
definition,
no
suggestion
that
it
applies
only
to
the
elderly,
or
only
to
some
mental
conditions,
or
only
if
mental
conditions
are
an
incidental
function
of
the
facility
in
question.
these
were
speculative
possibilities
on
limiting
the
statute
that
were
advanced
by
the
court
below
and
by
the
department's
brief
here.
and
the
court
and
the
department
said
maybe
it
means
this;
these
are
plausible,
possible
interpretations.
but
these
are
not
valid
speculations.
they're
the
product
really
of
the
mistaken
assumption
i
referred
to
at
the
outset,
that
the
mentally
ill
were
carved
out
as
a
class
for
coverage
under
the
medicaid
law,
and
that's
just
not
so.
there's
no
reason
not
to
give
full
scope
to
the
statutory
definition
of
icfs,
for
that
was
the
intent
of
congres.
the
senate
finance
committee,
which
initiated
the
medicaid
amendment
to
cover
icfs,
made
clear
the
intent.
its
report
states
that
the
icf
provision
was
for
people
who
would
otherwise
have
to
be
cared
for
in
the
higher
cost
and
higher
level
skilled
nursing
homes
or
in
mental
hospitals.
that
was
the
clear
statement
that
means
that
medicaid
was
intended
to
cover
people
in
icfs
who
otherwise
would
be
in
imds.
mental
hospitals
are
clearly
imds.
and
i
just
don't
think
it's
sensible
that
congress
meant
that
icfs
were
to
be
used
to
cover
people
with
mental
conditions,
but
only
if
they
don't
specialize
in
that
type
of
care.
middletown
haven
did
care
for
these
people
and
did
so
well.
it
specialized
in
the
treatment
of
mental
conditions,
but
it
wasn't
a
psychiatric
facility,
and
when
the
conditions
of
the
residents
became
sufficiently
severe,
they
had
to
be
returned
to
the
mental
hospitals,
and
they
were
in
substantial
number
whenever
that
was
called
for.
but
middletown
haven
is
exactly
the
kind
of
facility
that
was
contemplated
by
congress
when
the
medicaid
program
was
expanded
to
take
in
icfs
in
1971.
i
spoke
of
the
severe
negative
impact
that
the
department's...
acceptance
of
the
department's
position
would
have
in
this
case
on
the
proper
care
of
the
mentally
ill.
i'd
like
to
add
just
one
word,
and
that
is
the
impact
it
has
on
the
states
that
finance
these
programs.
this
is
not
a
case
where
vast
new
federal
outlays
will
occur
if
the
court
sustains
the
state's
position.
we're
dealing
here
with
funds
that
have
been
received
under
the
medicaid
program
and
expended
by
the
states
in
the
care
of
people
who
are
mentally
ill
in
intermediate
care
facilities.
if
the
department's
position
prevails,
the
states
involved
will
have
to
figure
out
how
to
raise
and
return
to
the
federal
government
tens,
if
not
hundreds
of
millions
of
dollars
of
funds
already
received
and
already
expended,
and
that's
going
to
have
a
severe
negative
impact
on
the
states,
as
well
as
on
their
future
ability
to
provide
care
not
just
for
the
mentally
ill
but
all
objects
of
social
security
act
programs.
thank
you.
