mr.
j.
thomas
sullivan
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court,
petitioner
this
morning
argues
that
the
jurisdictional
exception
noted
by
this
court
in
its
1912
decision,
diaz.
v.
united
states,
has
been
implicitly
or
by
implication
rejected
in
the
subsequent
decisions
of
the
court
in
waller
v.
florida
and
robinson
v.
neil.
the
petitioner
was
involved
in
an
automobile
accident
in
august
1981
in
southern
new
mexico
and,
as
a
result
of
that
accident,
two
things
happened.
he
was
charged
with
violation
of
municipal
ordinances
for
driving
while
intoxicated
and
for
careless
driving,
and
another
party
of
that
accident
was
injured.
the
petitioner
went
to
court
in
carlsbad,
new
mexico,
pleaded
no
contest
to
the
charges,
was
convicted
upon
his
plea,
and
was
sentenced.
that
sentence
included
confinement
in
an
alcohol
rehabilitation
unit
for
a
period
of
21
days,
followed
by
a
six-month
period
of
probation,
which
included
mandatory
weekly
alcohol
counseling
sessions.
in
september
of
1981,
the
party
who
had
been
injured
in
that
accident
died,
apparently
as
a
result
of
those
injuries,
and
the
state
commenced
a
felony
prosecution
for
vehicular
homicide.
the
defendant
was
tried
and
convicted.
his
first
conviction
was
set
aside
by
the
new
mexico
court
of
appeals
on
an
unrelated
ground,
and
on
remand
his
newly-retained
defense
counsel
filed
a
motion
to
dismiss,
arguing
that
based
upon
double
jeopardy
principles,
the
prior
convictions
for
lesser
included
offenses
in
the
carlsbad
municipal
court
barred
a
subsequent
state
prosecution
for
the
greater
offense
of
vehicular
homicide.
mr.
j.
thomas
sullivan
the
state
was
required
to
prove
either
that
as
a
result
of
unlawful
operation
of
a
vehicular
and
resulting
accident,
that
a
person
had
either
been
injured
and
sustained
great
bodily
injury,
or
had
died
as
a
result
of
that
accident.
the
state
was
required
further,
in
order
to
establish
the
felony
offense,
that
the
accused
was
either
operating
the
vehicular
while
driving
while
intoxicated
or
under
the
influence
of
drugs,
or
that
he
was
operating
the
vehicular
recklessly.
after
his
second
conviction,
the
new
mexico
court
of
appeals
reversed,
applying
double
jeopardy
law,
principles
enunciated
in
decisions
in
this
court,
to
hold
that
the
prior
convictions
in
municipal
court
for
lesser
included
offenses
barred
the
subsequent
vehicular
homicide
prosecution.
in
so
doing,
the
court
of
appeals
made
four
distinct
important
findings.
first,
it
rejected
the
argument
advanced
by
the
state
that
the
necessary
or
essential
facts
exception
of
diaz
v.
united
states
applied,
to
hold
that
the
state
was
justified
in
waiting
to
commence
its
vehicular
homicide
prosecution
until
after
that
injured
person
had
died.
the
court
of
appeals
looked
to
the
wording
of
the
new
mexico
statute
which
permits
the
state
to
commence
a
felony
prosecution.
mr.
j.
thomas
sullivan
yes,
your
honor.
but
the
threshold
of
the
decision
in
the
new
mexico
supreme
court
critically
relies
on
what
the
court
of
appeals
did
in
this
case
and
what
it
didn't
do.
mr.
j.
thomas
sullivan
i
believe
it's
necessary
to
understand
the
court
of
appeals'
reasoning
to
understand
why
we
believe
that
we're
entitled
to
the
bar
of
double
jeopardy
when
the
decisions
of
this
court
were
applied.
the
necessary
and
essential
facts
exception
of
diaz
were
rejected
by
the
court
of
appeals
because
the
state
could
have
prosecuted
because
the
injury,
causing
great
bodily
injury
to
the
victim
of
that
accident
was
available,
was
known
to
the
state
at
the
time
the
traffic
offenses
were
prosecuted.
second,
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
the
reckless
driving
and
careless
driving
offenses
are
greater
and
lesser
included
offenses
for
double
jeopardy
purposes.
that's
been
conceded
by
the
state
throughout
the
litigation.
third,
the
court
of
appeals
held
essentially
that
dwi
and
reckless
driving
are
lesser
included
offenses
under
every
case
of
the
felony
offense
of
vehicular
homicide.
they
are
included
because
the
vehicular
homicide
statute
defines
the
offense
in
terms
of
a
prior
commission
of
one
of
three
modes
of
driving
unlawfully:
driving
while
intoxicated,
driving
while
under
the
influence
of
drugs,
or
driving
recklessly.
what
the
court
of
appeals
finally
rejected
was
the
state's
argument
that
the
jurisdictional
exception
which
was
noted
by
this
court
in
diaz
would
apply
as
an
exception
to
the
double
jeopardy
bar.
as
i
understand
it,
the
jurisdictional
exception
applies
where
a
court
does
not
have
jurisdiction
over
an
offense
and
therefore
could
not
have
adjudicated
an
offense.
and
the
new
mexico
court
of
appeals
held
that
by
implication,
waller.
v.
florida,
robinson
v.
neil,
had
overruled
the
applicability
of
the
jurisdictional
exception
when
you're
looking
at
municipal
court
convictions
for
lesser
included
offenses
of
a
felony
prosecution
which
is
later
commenced
in
a
court
of
general
jurisdiction
in
the
state.
this
morning,
i
believe
we
are
focusing
on
the
supreme
court
decision,
the
decision
of
the
supreme
court
of
new
mexico,
which
held
that
diaz
v.
united
states
is
still
applicable
with
respect
to
the
jurisdictional
exception.
the
court
essentially
held
that
because
the
carlsbad
muncipal
court
had
no
jurisdiction
over
the
felony
offense
of
vehicular
homicide
its
judgments
on
the
lesser
included
traffic
offenses
could
not
serve
to
bar
prosecution
for
that
felony
offense
in
the
state
district
court,
which
is
a
court
of
general
jurisdiction
in
new
mexico.
the
state
has
argued
in
its
brief
to
this
court
an
alternative
theory
which
it
suggests
would
have
supported
the
judgment
of
the
new
mexico
supreme
court,
arguing
a
different
lesser
included
offense
analysis
than
was
ever
argued
in
the
new
mexico
courts.
and
we
would
argue,
for
purposes
of
our
petition
and
for
purposes
of
decision
of
this
court,
that
the
real
issue
to
be
focused
upon
is
whether
or
not
the
jurisdictional
exception
of
diaz
remains
valid
in
light
of
waller
v.
florida
and
robinson
v.
neil.
in
fact,
in
those
cases,
strikingly
similar
facts
to
those
presented
in
the
instant
case
resulted
in
reversals
of
subsequently
obtained
convictions--
mr.
j.
thomas
sullivan
--your
honor,
i
don't
believe
either
opinion
mentions
diaz.
mr.
j.
thomas
sullivan
i
don't
believe
it's
mentioned
in
illinois
v.
vitale.
i
believe
the
new
mexico
supreme
court
decision
in
manzanares
expressly
notes...
and
manzanares
is
a
pivotal
decision
because
the
subsequent
decisions
in
padilla,
companion
cases,
were
predicated
on
the--
mr.
j.
thomas
sullivan
--that's
filed
and
is
still
pending,
your
honor.
mr.
j.
thomas
sullivan
still
pending.
in
manzanares,
the
new
mexico
supreme
court
held
that
this
court
had
not
directly
addressed
the
jurisdiction
exception
issue
in
either
waller
or
subsequent
decisions.
mr.
j.
thomas
sullivan
but,
nevertheless,
it
applied
in
new
mexico;
that
new
mexico
still
recognized
that
there
was
a
jurisdictional
exception
emanating
from
diaz
v.
united
states
which
would
excuse
the
application
of
the
double
jeopardy
bar
where
a
court
of
limited
jurisdiction
could
not
have
heard
or
tried
or
convicted
on
the
greater
offense.
mr.
j.
thomas
sullivan
not
with
regard
to
questions
that
focus
on
a
preliminary
municipal
court
conviction,
followed
by
prosecution
in
a
court
of
general
jurisdiction
of
the
state.
i
think
there
is
an
argument
to
be
made
that
the
jurisdictional
exception
is
really
what
you
have
in
successive
state
and
federal
prosecutions
because
neither
court
would
have
jurisdiction
over
the
other's
offenses,
but
not
with
regard
to
municipal
state
prosecutions
because
the
jurisdictional
exception
in
those
cases
hinges
upon
the
notion
of
dual
sovereignty
which
was
what
was
expressly
rejected
by
the
court
in
waller,
and
then
applied
retroactively
in
robinson
v.
neil.
in
other
words,
without
a
concept
of
dual
sovereignty
backing
the
jurisdictional
exception,
you
don't
have
another
theory
upon
which
the
jurisdiction
of
the
municipal
court
is
limited
such
that
it
cannot...
all
charges
could
not
be
brought
in
a
single
prosecution.
the
new
mexico
statute--
mr.
j.
thomas
sullivan
--that
would
be
true,
your
honor,
if
in
fact
the
felony
statute
required
proof
of
the
death.
it
does
not
in
new
mexico
require
proof
of
the
death.
it
requires
either
proof
of
death
or
proof
of
a
great
bodily
injury.
and
the
court
of
appeals
was
very
explicit
in
holding
that
the
evidence
available
to
the
state
at
the
time
that
the
initial
charges
were
filed
would
have
supported
a
finding
of
great
bodily
injury.
there
is
no
distinction
in
punishment
between
vehicular
homicide
predicated
on
death
or
great
bodily
injury,
and
therefore
the
state
was
compelled
to
bring
all
of
its
charges
in
one
prosecution
and
at
the
same
time.
mr.
j.
thomas
sullivan
i
think
it
is
involved
in
the
sense
that
we
have
successive
or
multiple
punishments
imposed
in
this
case,
your
honor.
the
defendant
served
part
of
his
sentence
initially
imposed,
and
after
the
conviction
in
state
court,
another
sentence,
the
term
of
imprisonment
was
imposed.
i
believe
that's
multiple
punishments
for
the
same
offense.
for
our
purposes
and
i
think,
as
i
understand
the
rulings
of
this
court,
the
lesser
included
offenses,
the
traffic
offenses,
were
clearly
lesser
included
under
new
mexico
law
and
under
the
decisions
of
this
court,
and
thus
prior
conviction
on
those
charges
would
have
barred
both
a
second
trial,
a
second
conviction,
or
the
infliction
of
a
great
punishment,
assuming
as
we
must
in
new
mexico,
because
of
the
statutory
language,
the
state
had
no
reason
not
to
bring
the
felony
charge
at
the
same
time
it
charged
and
prosecuted
the
defendant
for--
mr.
j.
thomas
sullivan
--i
think,
your
honor,
that
the
supreme
court
decision
in
new
mexico
implicitly
excepted
the
court
of
appeals'
finding
on
the
necessary
or
essential
facts
exception
of
diaz.
it
seems
to
me
that
in
the
decision
itself,
the
court
recognized
that
the
court
of
appeals
was
correct;
that
the
state
could
have
brought
the
felony
prosecution
on
the
theory
of
great
bodily
injury.
it
didn't
have
to
wait
until
there
was
a
death,
but
that--
mr.
j.
thomas
sullivan
--and
it
was
a
lesser
included
offense.
mr.
j.
thomas
sullivan
yes,
your
honor,
i
believe
they
could.
the
state
law
also
defines
dwi
and
reckless
driving.
the
new
mexico
supreme
court
has
expressly
held
in
manzanares
that
the
district
court
in
new
mexico
is
accorded
general
jurisdiction,
and
in
fact
the
joinder
rule,
rule
10
of
the
rules
of
criminal
procedure
for
the
district
courts,
expressly
directs
that
in
a
prosecution
the
state
should
bring
all
the
felonies
and
misdemeanors
which
arise
from
the
same
transaction
or
occurrence.
in
this
case
there
was
really
no
reason
why
the
state
should
not
have
commenced
its
felony
prosecution
at
the
same
time
that
the
defendant
was
tried
on
the
lesser
included
offenses
of
dwi
and
reckless
driving.
mr.
j.
thomas
sullivan
no,
it
had
no
jurisdiction
to
try
the
felony,
your
honor.
just
as
in
waller
and
robinson
v.
neil,
as
i
understand
those
decisions,
the
defendant
in
each
case
was
tried
on
municipal
ordinances,
violations
of
municipal
ordinances
in
the
municipal
court.
those
were
deemed
to
have
been
the
same
offense,
and
if
they
were
the
same
offense,
in
fact
and
in
law,
then
the
prior
conviction
on
the
lesser
included
offenses
which
were
violations
of
ordinances
would
bar
the
subsequent
state
prosecution
in
a
court
of
general
jurisdiction.
i
think
that's
very
clear
from
the
decisions
in
waller
and
robinson,
and
particularly
from
the
district
court's
decision
on
remand
in
robinson,
where
the--
mr.
j.
thomas
sullivan
--well,
waller
rejected
the
notion,
as
i
understand
it,
that
because
of
a
doctrine
of
dual
sovereignty--
mr.
j.
thomas
sullivan
--that's
correct.
but
the
express
language
of
the
opinion,
your
honor,
was
that
the
court
rejects
the
florida
court's
conclusion
that
an
individual
could
twice
be
charged
for
the
same
offense
and
tried
for
the
same
offense,
both
in
the
municipal
court
or
a
court
of
limited
jurisdiction
and
then
in
a
court
of
general
jurisdiction.
those
are
exactly
the
facts
presented
in
this
case.
mr.
j.
thomas
sullivan
but,
your
honor,
i
think
the
jurisdictional
exception
in
that
case
would
have
to
flow
from
dual
sovereignty.
there
would
be
no
other
basis
for
considering
the
limitation.
mr.
j.
thomas
sullivan
that's
correct
your
honor.
mr.
j.
thomas
sullivan
i
agree,
your
honor,
that
there
is
a
distinguishing
feature
between
them.
mr.
j.
thomas
sullivan
no,
but
on
remand
when
the
district
court
of
the
eastern
district
of
tennessee
considered
the
jurisdictional
exception
that
was
then
argued,
the
court
said
it
was
untenable
to
accept
that
exception.
mr.
j.
thomas
sullivan
well,
your
honor,
i
believe
the
facts
in
waller
and
robinson
v.
neil
are
virtually
indistinguishable
from
the
facts
in
this
case.
you
have
municipal
court
convictions
for
violations
of
municipal
ordinances,
you
have
subsequent
prosecution
for
a
state-based
charged
before
the
general
jurisdiction--
mr.
j.
thomas
sullivan
--well,
i
think,
your
honor,
that's
possibly
true.
mr.
j.
thomas
sullivan
well,
your
honor,
whether
it
necessarily
or
implicitly
overruled
it
in
all
cases,
it
seems
to
me
fair
to
say
that
where
you're
talking
about
municipal
prosecutions
followed
by
state
prosecutions,
implied
at
least,
waller
rejects
the
notion
that
this
defendant
could
have
been
tried
in
municipal
court
for
dwi,
which
is
defined
both
under
state
statute
and
under
municipal
ordinance,
and
then
tried
for
an
offense,
a
greater
offense
requiring
proof
of
dwi
in
a
state
court
of
general
jurisdiction.
t
seems
to
me
that
that's
exactly
the
same
type
of
situation
that--
mr.
j.
thomas
sullivan
--i
think
that
it's
clear
that--
mr.
j.
thomas
sullivan
--it
was
clear
that
there
was
a
violation
of
a
municipal
ordinance.
mr.
j.
thomas
sullivan
well,
i
assume
that
that
issue
was
before
the
court--
mr.
j.
thomas
sullivan
--well,
your
honor,
the
essential
fact
is
that
parallel
facts
are
presented
in
that
case
and
in
this
case.
whether
waller
expressly
or
implicitly
overruled
diaz,
there
is
no
question
that
looking
at
the
pattern
of
double
jeopardy
decisions
of
this
court,
including
illinois
v.
vitale,
conviction
on
lesser
included
offenses
in
a
court
of
limited
jurisdiction...
and
i
believe
that's
also
the
situation
in
brown
v.
ohio...
serves
to
bar
a
subsequent
conviction
for
a
greater
offense
in
a
court
of
general
jurisdiction.
whether
or
not
the
new
mexico
supreme
court
was
correct
in
saying
there's
still
something
called
the
jurisdictional
exception...
and
there
may
be,
and
i
would
concede
that...
i
don't
think
it
can
withstand
the
application
of
the
principles
of
illinois
v.
vitale
or
brown
v.
ohio
in
this
particular
case,
because
here--
mr.
j.
thomas
sullivan
--yes,
the
court
of
appeals
did.
mr.
j.
thomas
sullivan
it
didn't
address
that
in
the
fugate
opinion.
mr.
j.
thomas
sullivan
no,
not
at
all.
mr.
j.
thomas
sullivan
i
think
you're
correct.
it
went
off
on
the
jurisdictional
exception,
the
applicability.
mr.
j.
thomas
sullivan
i
believe
so.
and,
your
honor,
that's
why
we
refer
back
continually
to
the
opinion
of
the
new
mexico
supreme
court
in
state
v.
manzanares,
because
in
fugate
the
supreme
court
itself
relied
on
the
reasoning
of
manzanares.
in
manzanares,
i
believe
the
court
recognized
that
these
were
lesser
included
offenses
of
the
greater
offense.
mr.
j.
thomas
sullivan
i
believe
it's
a
parallel
situation,
your
honor.
mr.
j.
thomas
sullivan
and
then
on
remand,
the
florida
court
was
permitted
to
review
whether
or
not
it
was,
in
fact,
a
lesser
included
offense.
mr.
j.
thomas
sullivan
well,
we
do
ask
you
to
do
so,
your
honor,
and
we
would
point
out
that
diaz
has
been
virtually
unfollowed
for
the
proposition,
except
in
new
mexico,
that
there
is
a
jurisdictional
exception
which
somehow
allows
a
state
to
avoid
the
double
jeopardy
bar
in
cases
exactly
like
this.
the
history
of
new
mexico
decisions
is
that
the
jurisdictional
exception
is
well-recognized
in
new
mexico
to
say
that
a
conviction
on
a
lesser
included
offense
in
a
court
of
limited
jurisdiction
does
not
bar
a
subsequent
prosecution
of
the
greater
offense.
and
i
believe
that
there
are
numerous
cases
cited
in
both
briefs
in
which
the
new
mexico
supreme
court
has
held
exactly
that
position.
it's
not
a
question
of
whether
or
not,
in
this
isolated
case,
these
facts
gave
rise
to
that.
but
that's
a
position
that's
been
generally
held
by
the
new
mexico
supreme
court.
the
parallel
situation
is
that
the
carlsbad
municipal
ordinance
is
virtually
identical
to
the
state
state
defining
the
same
offense.
the
state
had
jurisdiction
over
the
offense
of
dwi
or
over
the
offense
of
reckless
driving.
there
is
no
question
that
this
is
not
a
case
where
one
court
had
jurisdiction
over
some
type
of
conduct
that--
mr.
j.
thomas
sullivan
--the
state
would
prosecute
the
dwi
either
in
a
magistrate
court,
or
could
have
brought
all
those
charges
in
a
district
court
as
felonies
and
misdemeanors
under
the
joinder
rule.
the
carlsbad
municipal
court
did
not
have
jurisdiction,
obviously,
to
consider
prosecution
for
the
felony
offense.
thank
you.
mr.
j.
thomas
sullivan
just
a
few
points.
your
honor.
the
court
of
appeals
in
its
decision
held
under
new
mexico
statute
66a-101c,
vehicular
homicide
can
be
committed
only
by
reckless
driving
or
dwi.
if
you
look
at
the
statute
that
defines
the
felony
offense
of
reckless...
of
vehicular
homicide
it's
predicated
on
a
finding
of
either
dwi
or
driving
while
under
the
influence
of
drugs
or
a
finding
that
the
defendant
drove
recklessly.
they
are,
by
statute
and
by
the
decisions
of
the
court,
lesser
included
offenses
of
vehicular
homicide.
with
respect
to
the
argument
that
defendant
received
a
relatively
minor
sentence
and
for
that
reason
we
should
not
apply
the
double
jeopardy
clause,
the
defendant
subjected
himself
at
trial
in
the
carlsbad
municipal
court
to
a
potential
punishment
of
90
days
confinement
in
jail.
if
there's
a
problem
in
this
case,
the
problem
results
from
the
state
legislature's
decision
in
setting
penalties,
which
the
attorney
general
now
apparently
argues
are
their
grant
of
concurring
jurisdiction
to
municipalities
to
penalize
dwi.
if
that's
the
problem,
if
98
municipalities
cannot
seem
to
have
the
police
officers
correctly
assess
the
merits
of
a
prosecution
at
the
time,
the
simple
solution
to
that
is
for
the
legislature
to
withdraw
from
the
municipality
the
power
to
try
dwi
as
a
traffic
ticket
offense,
to
provide
only
that
the
district
court,
upon
review
by
the
district
attorney,
and
presentment
of
an
indictment
or
filing
of
the
criminal
information,
should
have
the
power
to
assess
which
charges
should
be
brought.
mr.
j.
thomas
sullivan
i
think
that's
a
relatively
simple
solution
if
the
problems
the
attorney
general
says
are
of
the
magnitude
he
claims
that
they
are.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
petitioner's
punishment
in
this
case
was
appropriate,
and
the
legislature
determined
it
was
appropriate
to
fit
a
first
offense
dwi
situation.
it
might
have
been
appropriate
whether
there
was
a
death
or
not.
the
trial
court
certainly
was
within
its
jurisdiction
at
the
district
court
level
to
probate
the
entire
sentence.
the
defendant
was
placed
on
a
period
of
probation
for
six
months
after
a
21-day
confinement
in
an
alcohol
care
unit.
i
believe
that's
something
more
than
dwi
school.
but
nevertheless,
he
was
subjected
to
punishment,
and
he
discharged
at
least
the
majority
of
that
punishment
before
the
state
came
back
and
charged
him
with
the
greater
offense
in
district
court.
it
seems
to
me
that
this
kind
of
multiple
prosecution
is
exactly
what
the
double
jeopardy
clause
protects
against,
the
filing
of
a
relatively
minor
charge
in
a
court
of
limited
jurisdiction,
and
then
the
subsequent
filing
of
a
greater
charge
with
a
minor
charge
was
clearly
the
lesser
included
offense.
to
follow
the
attorney
general's
reasoning,
all
significant
or
felony
charges
could
be
broken
down
into
constituent
elements,
could
be
prosecuted
in
courts
of
limited
jurisdiction;
the
state
could
evaluate
the
merits
of
its
case
and
proceed
to
felony
prosecution
later.
that's
the
kind
of
thing
that
it
seems
to
me
the
double
jeopardy
clause
has
protected
against
traditionally,
and
it
seems
to
me
that
the
opinions
in
illinois
v.
vitale
and
brown
v.
ohio
implicitly
recognize
there
is
no
question
in
this
case
but
that
these
are
lesser
included
offenses,
that
the
petitioner
discharged
his
duty
in
going
to
court,
pleading
no
contest,
accepting
his
punishment,
and
then
in
discharging
that
punishment.
for
that
reason,
we
believe
that
the
decision
in
the
new
mexico
supreme
court
in
applying
a
jurisdictional
exception,
which
i
still
think
is
rooted
in
the
notion
of
dual
sovereignty
where
you're
talking
about
municipal
and
subsequent
state
prosecutions,
was
simply
incorrect.
and
this
court
should
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
new
mexico
supreme
court.
thank
you.
mr.
j.
thomas
sullivan
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
j.
thomas
sullivan
he
could
have
been
tried
for
vehicular
homicide
your
honor.
mr.
j.
thomas
sullivan
if
he
hadn't
died,
he
still
could
have
been
tried
under
the
new
mexico
statute
for
vehicular
homicide.
mr.
j.
thomas
sullivan
in
the
first
instance--
mr.
j.
thomas
sullivan
--under
the
new
mexico
statute,
the
offense
is
complete
if
an
individual
sustains
a
great
bodily
injury
in
the
course
of
an
accident
while
the
defendant
is
driving
unlawfully.
mr.
j.
thomas
sullivan
it's
a
misnomer
to
call
it
a
homicide
because
the
statute
encompasses
both
a
serious
injury
case
and
a
death
case.
thank
you.
