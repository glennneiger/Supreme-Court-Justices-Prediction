justice
marshall
--is
there
a
case
that
says
they
can't
be
tried
together?
justice
marshall
that's
what
i
thought.
justice
marshall
do
i
understand
you,
that
this
man
voluntarily
went
in
and
made
them
give
him
21
days?
justice
marshall
do
you
know
of
any
other
place
where
somebody
has
gone
in
and
made
them
give
him
21
days?
justice
marshall
well,
isn't
it
strange?
justice
marshall
well,
do
you
know
of
anybody
else
who
has
volunteered
to
take
21
days?
justice
marshall
do
you
have
any
other
cases
in
new
mexico?
justice
marshall
is
new
mexico
different
from
all
other
states?
justice
marshall
are
the
people
in
new
mexico
just
the
kind
that
want
to
go
to
21
days?
justice
marshall
but
did
you
get
him
off
the
streets?
you
didn't.
he
just
went
to
a
school.
justice
marshall
he
didn't
go
to
jail.
justice
marshall
couldn't
you
have
made
it
three?
justice
marshall
in
fact,
there
is
no
limit
to
it,
is
there?
justice
marshall
has
that
happened
in
any
other
state
yet
that
doesn't
have
the
new
mexico
rule?
justice
marshall
the
one
that
you
say
that
you
can
try
him
any
time
you
get
ready
to
try
him.
or
do
you
have
to
put
the
maximum
on
him?
i
mean
every
other
state
has
gotten
along
with
this
without
the
thing
you
have
in
new
mexico.
justice
marshall
they
aren't
in
this
case.
they
aren't
interested
in
it.
justice
marshall
mr.
sullivan--
justice
marshall
--i
don't
know
what
it
has
to
do
with
this
case,
but
is
there
any
other
crime
that
this
man
could
have
been
tried
for
in
new
mexico
if
the
victim
had
not
died?
justice
marshall
if
he
hadn't
died--
justice
marshall
--you
mean
in
the
first
instance?
justice
marshall
how
can
he
be
convicted
of
homicide
if
there's
no
one
dead?
justice
marshall
yes,
but--
