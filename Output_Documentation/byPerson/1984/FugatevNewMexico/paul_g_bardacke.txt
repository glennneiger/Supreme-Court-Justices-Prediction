mr.
paul
g.
bardacke
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court,
i've
listened
to
petitioner's
argument
carefully
and
i
do
not
see
why
it
is
fair
for
the
defendant
fugate
to
have
killed
someone
while
driving
recklessly,
and
then
to
turn
and
say
to
the
state,
to
society,
and
the
victim's
family,
that
because
the
very
next
morning
he
rushed
into
municipal
court,
pled
no
contest
to
careless
driving
and
dwi,
that
he
then
cannot
be
brought
to
justice
for
the
later
vehicular
homicide.
mr.
paul
g.
bardacke
justice
o'connor,
the
injury
occurred
the
evening
before.
it
was
in
a
town.
it's
unclear
whether
the
district
attorney
even
knew.
but,
yes,
had
they
known
and
had
they
known
that
the
injury
that
lily
may
upton
suffered,
which
was
only
an
arm
injury
and
a
rib
injury
which
she
was
subsequently
released
from
the
hospital
for,
constituted
great
bodily
harm
at
that
time,
they
could
have
not
prosecuted
at
that
time.
mr.
paul
g.
bardacke
not
on
the
municipal
charges,
justice
brennan,
but
they
could
have
on
similar
charges
that
are
violations
of
state
crimes.
mr.
paul
g.
bardacke
almost
identical,
although
the
punishments
under
the
municipal
statutes
and
the
state
statutes
are
different.
mr.
paul
g.
bardacke
it
would
not
have
to
proceed.
what
the
fact
is
is
that
the
municipal
charges
could
have
been
dropped,
and
the
state
could
have
proceeded
on
state
charges
which
are
similar.
but
the
fact
is
in
this
case,
is
that
we
are
dealing
with
different
offenses.
these
are
not
the
same
offenses.
i
quarrel
with
only
one
fact
mentioned
by
petitoner's
counsel,
and
that
is
that
the
court
of
appeals
ruled
that
reckless
driving
and
dwi
were
necessarily
lesser
included
offenses
of
vehicular
homicide.
the
court
of
appeals
did
no
such
thing,
nor
did
the
supreme
court
reach
that
issue.
clearly,
if
you
apply--
mr.
paul
g.
bardacke
--no,
they
did
not.
the
court
of
appeals
treated
reckless
and
careless
driving
as
the
same
offense
and
lesser
included
in
vehicular
homicide
but
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
treat
dwi
and
reckless
as
lesser
included
of
vehicular
homicide.
and
if
it
had,
it
would
have
been
in
violation
of
the
controlling
law
of
the
state.
there
are
clearly
two
cases
cited
in
the
brief,
where
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
new
mexico
ruled
that
dwi
and
reckless
were
not
lesser
included
offenses
of
vehicular
homicide
and
those
are
state.
trujillo
and
state
v.
tanton.
mr.
paul
g.
bardacke
there
are
cases
saying
that
they
can
be
tried
together.
mr.
paul
g.
bardacke
but
i
think
the
analysis
in
this
case
is
clearly
that
they
are
not
the
same
offense.
if
you
apply
the
blockburger
test
as
further
enunciated
in
vitale,
you
can
see
than
it
meets
the
stringent
requirements
of
blockburger--
mr.
paul
g.
bardacke
--but
i
think
it's
the
most
persuasive
rationale.
mr.
paul
g.
bardacke
but
i
think
it's
clear
under
new
york
telephone
and
dandridge,
that
you're
entitled
to
argue
any
matter
before
this
court
that
could
sustain
the
lower
court.
mr.
paul
g.
bardacke
if
this
court
felt
that
there
was
any
question
as
to
whether
or
not
they
were
the
same
offense
under
state
law,
then
remand
would
be
appropriate.
but
i
think
it's
clear--
mr.
paul
g.
bardacke
--well,
the
supreme
court
has
two
clear
cases
on
this
issue,
tanton
and
trujillo,
in
which
they
say
specifically
that
dwi
and
vehicular
homicide
are
not
necessarily
included.
and
a
careful
reading
of
the
court
of
appeals
decision--
mr.
paul
g.
bardacke
--i
quite
agree.
this
court
is
the
one
that
should
say
what
test
new
mexico
should
follow,
and
then
new
mexico
should
follow
that
test
and
this
court
be
bound
by
the
interpretations--
mr.
paul
g.
bardacke
--justice
white,
that
is
what
i'm
doing,
and
that's
what
blockburger
requires
us
to
do.
it
is
a
case
of
statutory
analysis,
and
you
should
look
at
the
two
statutes
and
we
see
in
new
mexico
that
the
legislature--
mr.
paul
g.
bardacke
--well,
i
think
we
find
many
answers
in
your
cases,
but
i
think
that
is
the
answer,
however,
that
you
should
follow
in
this
case.
we
should
look
at
the
statutory
analysis.
and
clearly
in
blockburger,
it
says
whether
each
provision
requires
proof
of
a
fact
that
the
other
does
not.
and
in
this
case,
vehicular
homicide
can
be
proven
without
ever
proving
reckless
driving
or
dwi.
and
it
is
likewise
clear
that
in
this
case
you
can
prove
reckless
driving
and
prove
dwi,
and
you
haven't
proved
the
death
that
is
required.
mr.
paul
g.
bardacke
well,
i
don't
think
you
need
to
reach
an
exception
if
you're
dealing
with
the
same
offenses.
but
if
this
court
were
to
determine
that
they
were
the
same
offenses,
which
i
think
would
be
contrary
to
new
mexico
law,
then
i
would
argue
that
in
fact
the
diaz
exception
is
still
alive
and
well
in
new
mexico.
the
waller
holding...
very
narrow.
mr.
paul
g.
bardacke
well,
i
don't
believe
that
the
state
law
can
really
be
in
dispute
with
respect
to
the
lesser
included
offense
issue.
however,
just
as
in
the
case
argued
before
this,
it
is
often
times...
and
that's
what
dandridge
and
new
york
telephone
are
often
about...
that
a
respondent
comes
to
this
court
and
asks
you
to
affirm
a
judgment
of
the
lower
court,
based
on
a
different
ground,
and
i
think
it
is,
on
further
reflection,
a
much
more
persuasive
ground,
and
the
court
need
not
get
to
the
exception.
the
exception
is
easier
analysis,
but
should
this
court
determine
that
there
is
question
about
whether
they
are
the
same
offense
or
not,
then
remand
might
be
appropriate.
i
don't
think
that
question
exists.
and,
furthermore,
i
think--
mr.
paul
g.
bardacke
--well,
there
are
many
additional
drugs.
as
petitioner's
counsel
pointed
out,
he
was
charged
under
an
open
charge,
justice
stevens,
of
vehicular
homicide
which
amounts
to
the
unlaw
operation
of
a
vehicle.
and
unlawful
operation
of
a
vehicle
in
state
v.
barela
in
our
case
can
be
failure
to
stop,
speeding,
crossing
the
double
line,
two
of
which,
by
the
way,
were
present
in
the
fugate
case.
at
the
testimony
in
the
trial
and
part
of
the
record
in
this
case,
he
was
speeding
and
he
ran
a
stop
sign.
both
of
those
could
give
rise
to
vehicular
homicide
the
exact
same
statute
with
which
he
was
charged
in
this
case.
mr.
paul
g.
bardacke
it
depends
under
the
facts
of
reckless
driving.
he
would
have
been
charged...
if
it
showed
intent
and
willful
and
wantonness,
the
failure
to
stop
and
the
speeding
could
amount
to
recklessness,
but
not
in
all
cases.
i
think
that
if
this
court
were,
however,
convinced
that
it's
either
the
jurisdictional
exception
or
nothing,
i
think
it's
clear
that
the
waller
case
is
a
very,
very
narrow
holding.
it
merely
held
that
the
florida
court
was
in
error
for
trying
the
same
defendant
for
the
identical
charge
in
two
cases.
we're
not
dealing
with
the
identical
charge
in
this
case.
mr.
paul
g.
bardacke
not
permissible.
that
is
the
identical
offense,
and
it
could
not
have
been
brought
in
the
subsequent--
mr.
paul
g.
bardacke
--i
quite
agree.
mr.
paul
g.
bardacke
that's
correct,
if
the
offenses
are
identical.
mr.
paul
g.
bardacke
no,
i
do
not
concede
we
lose.
mr.
paul
g.
bardacke
i
understand
the
court's
point,
and
perhaps
it
wouldn't.
and
perhaps
it
wouldn't.
i
think
that
what
is
clear
in
this
case
also
is
that
the
original
circumstances
which
powered
the
rule
of
double
jeopardy
do
not
exist
in
this
case.
i
mean
double
jeopardy
is
founded
in...
has
its
roots
in
the
harshness
of
penalties
in
the
british
system.
and
i
think
it
was
intended
to
come
to
a
point
where
mere
traffic
citations
in
a
complex
society
could
raise
to
a
constitutional
level.
this
gentleman
went
in
the
next
morning,
pled
no
context,
went
to
dwi
school
for
21
days
before
completing
the
weekly
session
in
the
evening--
mr.
paul
g.
bardacke
--yes.
he
went
in
the
next
morning.
mr.
paul
g.
bardacke
no,
but
i
think
21
days--
mr.
paul
g.
bardacke
--no.
twenty-one
days
is
a
very
minor
penalty
for
drunk
driving
and
for
careless
driving.
mr.
paul
g.
bardacke
well,
if
someone
was
injured
in
the
accident
and
he
was
clever,
he
might
very
well
have
gone
in
the
next
morning
and
volunteered.
mr.
paul
g.
bardacke
where
he
volunteered?
mr.
paul
g.
bardacke
no,
it
is
not.
mr.
paul
g.
bardacke
we
have
a
two-tier
system
there
where
people
routinely
are
supposed
to
go
in
and
clear
themselves
of
traffic
citations.
that's
what
traffic
citations
are
about.
we
have
a
different
societal
purpose
in
dealing
with
traffic
citations,
prosecuting
people
for
them,
as
many
as
we
have
resources
for,
processing
them
quickly,
and
getting
these
people
off
the
street.
that
is
different
than
vehicular
homicide
where
society
and
our
legislature,
in
defining
a
separate
statutory--
mr.
paul
g.
bardacke
--well--
mr.
paul
g.
bardacke
--i
think,
justice
marshall,
that's
why
in
this
case,
this
man
didn't
run
the
gauntlet
twice.
he
didn't
have
two
trials.
he
didn't
have
two
punishments
that
were
unreasonable.
he
had
just
what
our
legislature
intended
when
it
proscribed
this
kind
of
criminal
activity.
and
in
brown
v.
ohio,
this
court
said
it
is
within
the
legislature's
domain,
within
the
legislature's
domain
to
describe
crimes
and
to
fix
penalties.
and
we
described
two
different
crimes
and
two
different
penalties--
mr.
paul
g.
bardacke
--it
could
have
been
three,
if
in
fact--
mr.
paul
g.
bardacke
--well,
it
depends
what
the
legislature
intends.
and
i
think
in
this
case
they
clearly
describe
two
separate
penalties,
two
separate
crimes,
and
that
is
what
is
within
the
legislature's
domain
in
this
case.
and
i
think
that
if
this
case
were
reversed,
there
would
be
horrible
consequences
for
both
society
and
drivers
like
mr.
fugate,
because
if
this
case
were
reversed,
it
would
require
the
police
officer
in
the
field
to
charge
the
maximum
consequences
of
the
act
of
a
driver.
if
there
were
a
minor
injury,
that
police
officer
in
one
of
the
98
municipalities
of
new
mexico
that
is
often
far
away
from
any
court
of
general
jurisdiction,
far
away
from
any
district
attorney,
would
be
out
there
and
say,
well,
this
may
be
vehicular
homicide
or
great
bodily
harm,
even
though
it's
a
minor
injury.
and
if
you
have
to
charge
like
that
to
avoid
the
consequences
of
perhaps
a
constitutional
claim
of
double
jeopardy,
then
what
you
have
is,
you
have
lots
of
people
being
overcharged.
you
are
requiring
them
to
stay
in
jail
longer,
to
have
higher
bail
set.
you
require
the
process
to
be
clouded,
while
later
on,
a
district
attorney
has
to
separate
the
wheat
from
the
chaff,
the
meritorious
case
from
the
meritless
case.
mr.
paul
g.
bardacke
which
new
mexico
rule?
mr.
paul
g.
bardacke
well,
i
don't
think
so.
i
think
most
states
have
a
two-tier
system.
and
i
think
the--
mr.
paul
g.
bardacke
--i
think
the
two-tier
system
is
important
and
it's
important
in
a
complex
society
where
we
have
lots
of
cars,
lots
of
drunk
drivers,
lots
of
reckless
drivers,
and
lots
of
people
being
killed.
i
think
the
purposes
that
a
legislature
directs
itself
to
when
it
describes
crimes
different
and
penalties
different,
recognizes
the
fact
that
we
have
a
desperate
need
for
an
almost
administrative
system
to
handle
traffic
citations
and
a
more
serious,
formal,
criminal
mode
in
which
to
handle
a
death
case,
because
in
that
case
the
legislature
intends
to
serve
the
public
interest
in
punishing
people
for
the
consequences
of
the
transaction
that
gave
rise
to
the
death.
i
think
that
in
this
case,
it
is
clear
that
we
are
not
dealing
with
the
same
offense,
and
in
not
dealing
with
the
same
offense,
we
don't
yet
reach
the
issue
of
the
jurisdictional
exception.
but
if
we
do
reach
the
issue
of
the
jurisdictional
exception,
i
think
it's
viable.
interestingly
enough,
the
day
this
court
decided
waller,
it
also
decided
ashe,
and
in
footnote
7
of
ashe
you
continued
the
jurisdictional
exception.
and
in
fact,
in
continuing
that
jurisdictional
exception
in
ashe,
decided
the
same
day,
you
have
given
it
vitality.
it
is
alive,
and
i
think
it
is
a
perfect
kind
of
exception
to
deal
with
traffic
citations,
in
recognizing
that
the
society
has
an
interest
in
handling
almost
administratively
traffic
citations,
and
in
a
separate
criminal
way
handling
vehicular
homicide.
i
would
urge
this
court
to
affirm
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
new
mexico.
thank
you.
mr.
paul
g.
bardacke
i
believe
it
was
footnote
7
of
ashe.
mr.
paul
g.
bardacke
well,
doesn't
it...
isn't
it
at
footnote...
i'm
sorry.
it's
in
footnote
7
of
the
concurring
opinion
of
justice
brennan,
i
believe.
mr.
paul
g.
bardacke
no,
it
was
a
concurring
opinion
of
justice
brennan.
mr.
paul
g.
bardacke
yes,
it
does
make
a
difference.
mr.
paul
g.
bardacke
yes,
i
think
it
makes
a
difference,
it's
more
in
favor
of
my
case.
[laughter]
thank
you.
