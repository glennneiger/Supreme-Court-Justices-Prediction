justice
rehnquist
mr.
sullivan,
it's
the
judgment
of
the
supreme
court
of
new
mexico
that's
being
reviewed
here,
isn't
it?
justice
rehnquist
so
you
say
it's
necessary
for
us
to
understand
the
court
of
appeals'
reasoning
in
order
to
understand
the
supreme
court's
reasoning?
justice
rehnquist
but
you
agree,
i
take
it,
or
you
don't
challenge
the
ruling
that
the
municipal
court
or
whatever
it
was
in
eddy
county,
did
not
have
jurisdiction
to
try
the
felony.
justice
rehnquist
but
there
is
nothing
in
diaz
that
talks
about
dual
sovereignty.
diaz
just
talks
about
the
different
jurisdiction
of
courts
in
the
same
system.
justice
rehnquist
so
i
don't
think
it's
right
to
say
that
the
jurisdictional
exception
depends
on
the
exception
of
the
dual
sovereignty
here.
the
dual
sovereignty
theory
that
florida
sought
to
defend
in
waller
was
an
attempt
to
apply
a
body,
the
federal/state
thing,
and
florida
said
just
like
you
applied
it
to
the
federal
versus
state
prosecution,
applied
in
state
versus
municipal
prosecution.
we
said
no.
but
that's
not
the
same
as
the
jurisdiction.
justice
rehnquist
when
the
new
mexico
disagrees
with
the
district
court
for
tennessee,
that's
what
we
are
here
about
it.
justice
rehnquist
well,
if
the
argument
in
waller
had
been
that
there's
a
jurisdictional
exception
in
double
jeopardy,
the
case
might
have
come
out
differently.
justice
rehnquist
it
didn't
have
any
occasion
to
disturb
it,
did
it,
because
it
went
off
on
a
different
line
of
reasoning.
justice
rehnquist
i
think
what
justice
white
is
intimating
is
that
we
tend
to
review
a
question
that
is
decided
by
the
state
supreme
court,
rather
than
trying
to
find
some
other
grounds
for
affirming
its
judgment
that
may
be
dependent
on
state
law.
justice
rehnquist
do
you
really
regard
that
as
a
simple
solution?
