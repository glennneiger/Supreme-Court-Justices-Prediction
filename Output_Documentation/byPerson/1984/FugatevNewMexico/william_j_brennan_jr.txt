justice
jr.
well,
mr.
sullivan,
could
both
the
traffic
offense
and
the
felony
charge
been
tried
in
the
upper
court?
justice
jr.
yes,
but
for
our
purposes,
we
treat
the
case,
don't
we,
the
way
the
state
supreme
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
treats
it.
justice
jr.
well,
didn't
we
do
exactly
that
in
waller?
justice
jr.
and,
mr.
attorney
general,
could
the
state
have
superseded
the
municipality
in
the
magistrate
court?
justice
jr.
well,
are
they
the
same?
justice
jr.
are
you
telling
me,
then,
that
the
municipal
prosecution,
even
over
the
state's
objection,
would
have
to
proceed?
justice
jr.
you
say
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
treat
them--
