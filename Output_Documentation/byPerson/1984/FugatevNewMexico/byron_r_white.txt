justice
white
was
diaz
even
mentioned
in
either
of
those
cases?
justice
white
and
neither
in
vitale.
justice
white
i've
forgotten.
what
happened
in
manzanares?
wasn't
that
filed
here?
justice
white
it's
still
pending
here?
justice
white
but,
nevertheless,
what?
justice
white
your
argument
is
that
diaz
could
not
possibly
have
survived
waller
and
brown.
justice
white
if
at
the
time
of
the
municipal
action
the
person
wasn't
dead,
it
would
be
hard
to
bring
at
all
in
the
municipal
court.
justice
white
and
also
that
it
was
a
lesser
included
offense.
justice
white
what
did
waller
hold?
justice
white
right.
that's
all
it
rejected
was
the
dual
sovereignty
theory.
justice
white
well,
that
may
be,
but
all
they
based
it
on,
all
they
rejected
was
the
dual
sovereignty
theory.
they
didn't
address
the
jurisdiction.
justice
white
well,
robinson
v.
neil
didn't
add
anything
to
that.
justice
white
well,
you
can't
say,
then,
that
waller
implicitly
or
necessarily
overruled
diaz.
justice
white
do
you
think
it
appears
anywhere
in
the
record
in
waller
or
in
the
arguments
as
what
the
jurisdiction
of
the
municipal
court
was?
justice
white
you'd
have
to
go
and
look
at
florida
law,
wouldn't
you?
justice
white
that
may
be.
that
may
be,
but
how
do
we
know
what
the
jurisdiction...
how
did
we
know
even
then
what
the
jurisdiction
of
the
municipal
court
was?
justice
white
well,
you
assume.
but
show
me
where
it
was.
justice
white
mr.
sullivan,
i
gather
the
court
of
appeals
treated
the
municipal
charges
as
lesser
included
offenses,
did
they
not?
justice
white
and
your
supreme
court
didn't
disturb
that,
did
it?
justice
white
but
it
didn't
disturb
that,
did
it?
justice
white
in
other
words,
the
intermediate
public
court
treated
it
as
a
lesser
included
offense.
it
wasn't
disturbed,
and
we
reversed.
justice
white
whether
we
intended
to
overrule
diaz
or
not,
you
certainly
asked
us
to
do
so.
justice
white
in
which
court
would
the
state
prosecute?
justice
white
well,
that's
a
different
rationale
for
affirming
the
court
below.
justice
white
well,
that
may
be,
but
that
isn't
the
word
we
have
from
the
new
mexico
courts
in
this
case.
justice
white
let's
assume
we
said
that
the
jurisdictional
exception
does
not
apply.
diaz
is
a
dead
letter.
we
certainly
would
remand
to
see
if
these
are
really
lesser
included
offenses.
justice
white
well,
we
would
just
have
to
take
your
word
or
what
the
new
mexico
cases
say
for
what
the
law
is,
rather
than
the
court
of
appeals
of
your
state.
justice
white
well,
that
may
be.
that
may
be.
but
the
standard
or
their
analysis
as
to
how
you
go
about
deciding
whether
something
is
a
lesser
included
offense
or
not
may
not
be
consistent
with
federal
law.
justice
white
you
are
following
the
statutory
elements
analysis.
justice
white
you
think
that's
the
only
answer
you
find
in
our
cases?
justice
white
i
think
that
you're
still
defending
your
supreme
court's
judgment
that
diaz
is
still
good
law.
