the
additional
fact
is
driving
under
the
influence
of
drugs.
justice
stevens
can
they
also
give
rise
to
the
reckless
driving
charge?
justice
stevens
may
i
ask,
if
we
were...
following
up
on
justice
brennan's
question
earlier...
if
the
reckless
driving
charge
had
been
brought
in
the
court
of
general
jurisdiction
after
it
had
been
brought
in
the
court
of
limited
jurisdiction,
would
that
have
been
permissible
in
your
view?
justice
stevens
the
dual
jurisdiction
exception
would
not
apply
in
that
event.
justice
stevens
what
is
the
scope
of
the...
the
jurisdictional
exception
then,
does
not
apply
if
the
offenses
are
the
same.
you
would
concede
that,
i
gather.
justice
stevens
if
you're
wrong
on
the
major
argument
you're
making,
you
concede
you
lose.
justice
stevens
if
it's
the
same
offense...
i
don't
understand.
why
is
one
the
same...
i
know
you
don't
agree
with
this,
but
if
the
homicide
charge,
vehicular
homicide
charge,
were
the
same
offense,
why
would
the
jurisdictional
exception
analysis
be
any
different
than
if
they
had
charged
him
for
reckless
homicide
in
the
court
of
general
jurisdiction?
justice
stevens
may
i
just
ask
one
other
question?
you
said
in
footnote
7
of
ashe,
we
confirm
the
jurisdictional
exception?
justice
stevens
i've
got
it
in
front
of
me.
it's
just
got
a
lot
of
cases
cited.
justice
stevens
so
it's
not
the
court's
opinion.
justice
stevens
that
makes
a
difference.
justice
stevens
which
way?
[laughter]
