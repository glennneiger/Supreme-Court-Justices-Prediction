justice
rehnquist
or
you
might
say
they
did
their
work
against
the
ker
and
frisbie
cases
in
that
case.
justice
rehnquist
well,
but
there
is
a
certain
amount
of
waste
motion
involved
here
if
we
sustain
your
claim.
there's
no
charge
that
the
trial
was
in
any
way
unfair.
if
we
sustain
your
claim
and
say
that...
your
client's
claim
and
say
that
the
judgment
in
indiana
was
void,
he's
returned
to
michigan.
the
charges
in
indiana
are
outstanding.
indiana
can
again
request
extradition,
and
he'll
be
extradited
and
tried
again
when
there's
no
complaint
that
his
first
trial
was
unfair.
justice
rehnquist
--well,
it
seems
like
there's
a
certain
accounting
approach
to
bringing
someone
back
to
indiana,
trying
them
for
an
offense,
and
then
sentencing
them
to
a
concurrent
sentence
to
one
which
they're
already
serving
in
michigan.
it
clears
the
books,
but--
justice
rehnquist
--well,
was
the
sentence
imposed
by
the
indiana
court
here
consecutive?
justice
rehnquist
well,
we
don't
generally
get
oral
argument
on
petitions
for--
justice
rehnquist
even
if
there
were
such
a
surrender,
perhaps
the
only
person...
the
only
party
you
could
claim
violation
of
would
be
the
state
of
michigan.
justice
rehnquist
--rather
than
the
defendant.
