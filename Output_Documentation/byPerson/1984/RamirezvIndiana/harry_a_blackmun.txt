justice
blackmun
mr.
ripple,
in
that
connection,
where
is
your
client
now?
justice
blackmun
so
he
has
not
been
returned
to
michigan
to
continue
his
sentence
there.
justice
blackmun
in
that
connection,
let
me
ask
you,
is
michigan
unsympathetic
to
indiana's
position
here?
why
should
michigan
want
him
back?
justice
blackmun
i
know
what
the
facts
are.
justice
blackmun
i
know
what
the
facts
are.
justice
blackmun
but
michigan
isn't
complaining
here,
is
it?
justice
blackmun
why
should
they
complain?
justice
blackmun
but
indiana
has
the
obligation
and
the
expense
of
taking
care
of
your
client,
not
michigan.
justice
blackmun
they
got
rid
of
him.
justice
blackmun
mr.
ripple,
will
you
spell
out
for
me
wherein
your
client
has
suffered
prejudice
other
than
not
having
a
formalistic
procedure
to
follow?
he
knew
of
the
pending
charge
in
indiana,
the
more
serious
one.
he
had
pleaded
not
guilty
to
it.
and
presumably
even
on
your
alternative
suggestion,
he
could
go
back
to
michigan
and
redo
it
all
over
again.
i
suppose
what
you're
saying
is
is
he
was
prejudiced
because
the
state
of
michigan
and
its
governor
didn't
have
the
opportunity
listen
to
him
and
reach
a
contrary
conclusion;
and
that's
a
pretty
weak
reed
on
which
to
lean,
isn't
it?
justice
blackmun
well,
this
is
a
little
different
from
world-wide
volkswagen
in
the
sense
that
you
can
see
that
indiana
had
some
jurisdiction
over
him,
for
the
lesser
charge
in
any
event.
justice
blackmun
so
you're
giving
them
partial
jurisdiction.
justice
blackmun
what
is
the
factual
answer
to
all
this?
was
this
a
prosecutor's
blunder,
do
you
think,
or
was
indiana
purposefully
deceiving
you?
justice
blackmun
well,
of
course,
michigan
isn't
here
with
an
amicus
brief
either.
justice
blackmun
well,
on
your
basis
i
would
expect
them
to
be
here.
justice
blackmun
counsel,
i'm
confused
about
one
thing.
what
is
the
routine
in
these?
suppose
you
have
a
proper
indiana
conviction.
does
he
serve
that
one
first,
or
does
he
go
back
to
michigan
and
finish
out
his
sentence
there?
justice
blackmun
where
would
he
serve
them?
justice
blackmun
that's
the
way
i
thought
you
read
the
statute,
and
yet
that
didn't
happen
in
this
case.
