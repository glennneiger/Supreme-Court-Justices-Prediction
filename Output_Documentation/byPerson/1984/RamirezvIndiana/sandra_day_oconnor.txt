justice
o'connor
mr.
ripple,
assuming
there's
a
violation
of
the
requirements
of
the
iad,
i
think
the
more
difficult
question
is
what's
the
remedy,
because
the
iad
is
silent
on
what
you
do
about
it.
so
a
mistake
was
made.
now
what
do
we
have
to
do?
the
iad
expressly
provides
for
dismissal
in
some
circumstances...
a
violation
of
time
for
trial
limits,
for
example...
but
is
certainly
silent
as
to
any
remedy
here.
and
secondarily,
even
if
dismissal
were
somehow
appropriate,
why
in
the
world
should
it
be
with
prejudice?
i
just
think...
i'm
concerned
about
those
aspects.
justice
o'connor
well,
it's
just
hard
to
understand
why
you
think
that
should
occur.
i
mean
what
is
unfair
here
about
letting
the
matter
proceed
again?
justice
o'connor
these
are
very
serious
charges,
and
i
just
wondered
what
in
the
world
would
justify
a
dismissal
with
prejudice.
justice
o'connor
well,
i
assume
the
indiana
judge
could
have
sentenced
him
to
a
consecutive
sentence,
in
which
case
he
would
have
gone
back
to
michigan
to
fill
that
term
and
come
back
to
indiana,
right?
justice
o'connor
well,
is
there
no
claim
at
all
on
the
part
of
the
defendant,
that
i
thought
was
being
asserted,
to
have
his
right
to
argue
in
michigan
the
appropriateness
of
the
disposition
of
michigan
to
send
him
off
in
response
to
the
detainer?
justice
o'connor
well,
it
seems
to
me
it's
related
that
there
is
no
jurisdiction
until
there's
a
proper
extradition,
and
there
wasn't
a
proper
extradition
on
these
charges,
and
that
the
defendant
has
some
right
to
a
proper
extradition
proceeding
under
the
iad.
i
mean
at
least
that's
how
i
understand
the
article.
justice
o'connor
you
mean
there's
a
1983
action
ahead--
justice
o'connor
--against
indiana?
justice
o'connor
what
would
happen
if
we
were
to
agree
that
dismissal
is
appropriate
but
without
prejudice?
what
would
happen
at
that
point?
justice
o'connor
i
suppose
because
michigan
has
already
paroled
him,
he
would
not
have
to
be
sent
back
to
michigan.
you
could
just
refile
on
the
spot.
justice
o'connor
yes.
that's
my
inquiry.
