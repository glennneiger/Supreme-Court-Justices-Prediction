mr.
william
earl
daily
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
indiana
did
not
solicit
amicus
participation
in
this
brief,
and
i
apologize
for
that.
but
i
am
certain
that
as
in
other
cases--
mr.
william
earl
daily
--michigan,
in
answer
to
another
question,
promptly
paroled
the
defendant
in
this
case
after
his
conviction
in
indiana,
i
presume
so
as
not
to
have
to
pay
for
his
upkeep
during
his
incarceration.
he
has
not...
if
a
remedy
is
a
retrial
in
this
case,
i'm
not
certain
that
he
can
be
returned
to
michigan
involuntarily.
michigan
has
no
longer
a
claim
on
him,
and
he
is
a
resident,
a
long-time
resident
of
howard
county,
indiana.
he
apparently
just
want
to
michigan
for
a
drug
deal,
was
caught
and
convicted
there.
the
petition
in
this
case
contends
that
we
have
somehow...
that
the
court
of
appeals
in
indiana
somehow
decided
that
his
interpretation
of
the
second
document
is
correct.
i
don't
read
that
in
the
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals
of
indiana.
the
court
of
appeals
did
hold
that
there
was
a
violation
of
the
interstate
agreement
on
detainers.
i
don't
find
in
there
a
holding
that
the
second
document
sent
to
michigan
is
not
a
detainer
within
the
meaning
of
the
interstate
agreement
on
detainers.
and
we
contend
that
it
is
a
detainer
within
that
agreement.
the
agreement
does
not
define
detainer.
a
detainer
is
simply
any
document
which
puts
the
holding
state
on
notice
that
the
prisoner
is
wanted
in
another
state
for
trial
on
a
criminal
charge.
the
second
document
sent
to
michigan,
entitled
4-24,
fulfills
that
test
for
a
detainer.
therefore,
we
maintain
there
was
a
detainer
sent
to
michigan
on
4-24;
therefore,
article
4(d),
relied
upon
entirely
by
the
petitioner,
does
not
apply
in
this
case.
the
kansas
supreme
court
in
a
case
entitled
state
v.
clark,
and
referred
to
in
our
brief,
addressed
that
very
issue
and
held
that
a
request
for
temporary
custody
in
the
absence
of
some
other
document
is
a
detainer.
we
have
a
detainer
in
this
case.
unfortunately,
the
detainer,
the
request
for
temporary
custody,
used
the
word
4
controlled
substance>
["].
but
it
did
refer
to
the
proper
cause
number,
the
proper
counts;
it
did
inform
the
holding
institution
that
indiana
wanted
this
gentleman
back
for
trial
in
indiana.
the
consequence
for
filing
that
request
for
temporary
custody
is
that
it
triggers
the
speedy
trial
provisions
of
the
interstate
agreement
on
detainers,
and
that's
exactly
the
purpose
for
the
adoption
of
the
interstate
agreement,
to
provide
for
incarcerated
prisoners
a
method
to
obtain
their
speedy
trial
rights
under
the
constitution.
we
provided
that.
we
have
given
the
defendant
here
the
benefit,
the
intended
benefit
of
the
interstate
agreement
on
detainers.
had
we
not
tried
him
after
getting
custody
back
under
424,
he
would
then
have
been
entitled
to
the
remedies
provided
by
the
statute.
if
we
had
not
tried
him
within
120
days,
he
was
entitled
to
discharge
with
prejudice.
if
we
had
sent
him
back
to
michigan
in
order
for
this
procedure
that's
talked
about,
the
hearing
procedure,
if
we
sent
him
back
to
michigan,
the
no
return
provision
of
the
interstate
agreement
on
detainers
says
we
cannot
try
him
thereafter.
he
is
entitled
to
dismissal
with
prejudice.
so
the
prosecutor
here
is
faced
with
a
terrible
decision.
if
the
request
for
temporary
custody
is
a
detainer,
and
he
sends
him
back
to
michigan,
he
is
forever
precluded
from
trying
that
defendant.
in
that
sort
of
catch-22
position,
i
think
the
prosecutor
did
the
only
thing
he
could
do.
he
proceeded
to
trial
on
cause
number
424.
if
we
assume
for
a
moment
that
the
defendant
is
right
and
that
the
court
of
appeals
did
say
that
this
is
not
a
detainer...
i
don't
find
that
there,
but
if
they
said
it's
not
a
detainer
on
424,
we
then
must
examine
article
5(d)
to
see
if
it
provides
what
the
petitioner
says.
mr.
william
earl
daily
and
indiana
acknowledges
that
there
has
been
a
violation
of
the
interstate
agreement
on
detainers,
but
it
is
not
the
failure
to
file
a
detainer
in
424.
mr.
william
earl
daily
it
is
putting
incorrect
information
on
the
detainer.
and
there
is
a
violation
by
michigan
in
failing
to
notify
the
defendant
that
a
detainer
had
been
filed.
mr.
william
earl
daily
indiana's
violation,
although
it
doesn't
specifically
require
the
receiving
state
to
be
notified
of
the
exact
nature
of
the
charge
against
him,
i
think
it
could
be
held
to
be
a
violation
of
the
agreement
to
incorrectly
notify
the
holding
state
as
to
the
nature
of
the
charge.
michigan's
violation
is
much
more
clear.
there
was
no
indication,
no
notice
to
the
defendant
that
he
was
wanted
on
charge
424
in
indiana.
mr.
william
earl
daily
yes,
your
honor,
we
do,
clearly.
if
there
was
a
detainer,
article
5(d)
doesn't
apply,
and
the
indiana
court
had
clear
jurisdiction
to
try
the
defendant
on
cause
number
424
the
drug
charge
with
no
problem.
if
it's
not
a
detainer,
as
maintained
by
the
petitioner,
then
we
need
to
examine
article
5(d)
of
the
interstate
agreement
on
detainers.
that
article
has
eight
paragraphs,
those
numbered
paragraphs
or
lettered
paragraphs
(a)
through
(h).
each
deal
with
a
different
aspect
of
the
interstate
agreement
on
detainers.
the
petitioner
has
lifted
out
the
first
sentence
of
5(d),
but
5(d),
in
order
to
be
understood,
must
be
read
as
a
whole.
the
first
sentence
provides
that
temporary
custody
shall
be
only
for
the
purpose
of
permitting
prosecution
on
the
untried
charges
which
form
the
basis
for
the
detainer.
and
if
it
stopped
there,
the
petitioner's
position
would
be
much
stronger.
but
the
second
sentence
of
article
5(d)
i
think
explains
the
purpose
for
it.
it
goes
on
to
say
that
except
for
his
attendance
at
court
and
while
being
transported
to
or
from
any
place
where
his
presence
may
be
required,
the
prisoner
shall
be
held
in
jail.
that
is
the
purpose
for
that
first
clause,
to
ensure
that
the
prisoner
is
held
in
jail
and
returned
to
the
sending
state
after
his
trial
in
the
receiving
state.
and
that
interpretation
coincides
exactly
with
the
expressed
purposes
of
the
interstate
agreement
on
detainers.
the
final
provision
of
the
interstate
agreement
on
detainers,
article
9(1),
indicates
that
the
agreement
is
to
be
liberally
construed
so
as
to
effectuate
its
purposes.
if
you
liberally
construe
article
5(d),
you
do
not
come
to
the
conclusion
reached
by
the
petitioner
in
this
case.
the
purposes--
mr.
william
earl
daily
--one
of
the
benefits
that
petitioner
has
in
this
case
and
that
prisoners
have
under
the
interstate
agreement
on
detainers
is
that
they
can,
unless
the
court
indicates
otherwise,
serve
these
sentences
concurrently.
so
that
in
this
case
the
petitioner,
rather
than
having
to
delay
his
sentence
on
424
until
he'd
been
sent
back
to
michigan,
and
if
we
could
have
brought
him
back,
then
brought
him
back
and
tried
him,
he
had
the
benefit
of
being
able
to
serve
concurrently
both
his
michigan
and
indiana
sentences.
mr.
william
earl
daily
ordinarily
he
would
be
returned
to
the
sending
state.
he
would
have
gone
back
to
michigan
first
to
serve
out
his
term
there,
and
then
come
to
indiana.
mr.
william
earl
daily
because
immediately
after
sentencing
in
indiana,
the
michigan
authorities
paroled
him,
said
we
don't
want
him
back,
in
effect.
mr.
william
earl
daily
that's
true.
that
could
have
happened.
it
did
not
in
this
case.
there
is
no
expression
of
concern
in
the
purposes
for
which
this
agreement
was
adopted
which
relates
to
the
number
of
crimes
for
which
a
prisoner
can
be
tried
when
he's
brought
back
to
a
state.
mr.
william
earl
daily
the
michigan
authorities
were
well
aware
that
he
had
been
convicted
and
sentenced
in
indiana
at
the
time
of
the
parole
hearing
in
michigan.
mr.
william
earl
daily
that
he
would
be
paroled?
mr.
william
earl
daily
if
he
were
not
paroled,
he
would
be
still
maintained
at
the
expense
of
michigan
in
michigan
prisons.
mr.
william
earl
daily
i
have
no
way
of
being
sure
of
the
thought
processes
behind
the
michigan
parole
authority's
decision,
but
i
very
much
assume
that
their
prison
system
is
as
crowded
as
ours,
and
they
were
very
happy
to
turn
him
over
to
indiana
for
custody.
mr.
william
earl
daily
that's
certainly
one
of
the
reasons
for
the
interstate
agreement
on
detainers,
so
that
prisoners
can
get
rid
of
pending
charges,
and
unless
they
are
sentenced
to
consecutive
sentences,
they
can
serve
them
out
concurrently
rather
than
consecutively.
but
the
prisoners
get
the
benefit
of
that
provision,
assuming
there's
not
a
consecutive
sentence
imposed
by
the
second
state.
mr.
william
earl
daily
no,
it
was
not.
it
was...
there
was
a
consecutive
sentence,
but
there
was
a
two-year
sentence
for
the
marijuana
charge
and
a
five-year
sentence
for
the
drug
charge
in
indiana,
but
those
sentences
were
to
be
served
concurrently
with
the
michigan
sentences.
there's
no
indication
otherwise.
mr.
william
earl
daily
well,
in
this
case
it
turned
out
it
be...
it
turned
out
to
be
more
than
the
michigan
sentence.
he
has
since
his
conviction
served
in
indiana.
if
article
5(d)
could
be
read
as
limiting
the
number
of
crimes
for
which
the
prisoner
can
be
tried
while
in
temporary
custody,
it's
the
state
of
michigan
which
should
be
asserting
that.
article
5(d)
was
enacted
for
the
benefit
of
michigan,
not
the
benefit
of
the
prisoner.
if
the
prisoner
is
released
from
custody
in
the
receiving
state,
if
we
do
anything
with
the
prisoner,
the
receiving
state
not
permitted
by
article
5(d),
michigan
has
the
right
to
go
to
court
and
seek
a
remedy,
a
relief.
michigan
has
not
done
that.
if
michigan
were
sitting
at
that
table
arguing
in
this
case,
i
would
be
in
very
bad
trouble,
assuming
that
there's
not
a
detainer
in
this
case.
but
michigan
is
not
there,
and
michigan
is
not
asserting
its
rights,
and
there
is
nothing
in
this
agreement
which
appears
to
transfer
from
michigan
its
right
to
the
defendant.
this
court
in
past
cases
has
looked
at
interstate
agreements
and
applied
contract
law
or
treaty
law.
if
you
apply
that
law
and
you
say
was
this
an
intended
third-party
beneficiary,
i
don't
think
you
could
find
anything
in
the
agreement
that
indicates
that
this
is
an
intended
third-party
beneficiary
who
is
intended
to
have
the
rights
to
assert
michigan's
claim
here.
obviously--
mr.
william
earl
daily
--no,
because
the
petitioner
in
this
case
is
asserting
a
different
violation
of
the
interstate
agreement
on
detainers.
that
argument
has
not
been
raised
by
the
petitioner.
that
argument
could
be
raised
had
he
adopted
that
approach,
i
think.
but
in
this
case
the
argument
is
based
on
total
lack
of
jurisdiction
in
the
indiana
court.
mr.
william
earl
daily
that
may
be
true,
but
then
the
remedy
in
that
case
is
perhaps
the
civil
remedy
that...
the
petitioner
here
is
pursuing
a
civil
remedy
through
the
u.s.
district
court
for
the
southern
district
of
indiana.
and
if
there
is
a
remedy,
i
think
it
is
fashioned
in
that
proceeding
rather
than
in
this
one.
if
we
assume
for
the
same
of
argument
that
article
5(d)
was
intended
to
benefit
the
petitioner--
mr.
william
earl
daily
--yes,
your
honor,
there's
a
1983--
mr.
william
earl
daily
--there's
a
1983
action.
the
seventh
circuit
has...
the
action
was
originally
dismissed
by
the
district
court.
the
seventh
circuit
has
reversed
that
dismissal
and
sent
it
back
for
further
proceedings,
apparently
finding
that
there
is
a
civil
remedy
of
some
sort
for
the
petitioner
in
this
case.
mr.
william
earl
daily
presumably
the
defendant
would
be
retried.
the
facts
in
this
case
are
overwhelming,
and
he
would
be
reconvicted,
resentenced.
he
has
served
all
but
one
month
of
his
presumed
sentence.
mr.
william
earl
daily
i
don't
know
that
we
can
send
him
back
to
michigan.
they
have
no
claim
on
him,
and
if
he
is
released,
we
can't
force
him
to
go
back.
mr.
william
earl
daily
the
petitioner
asserts
that
by
adopting
this
agreement
the
state
has
somehow
waived
its
right
to
bring
prisoners
into
a
state
illegally.
of
course,
the
state
doesn't
have
a
right
to
bring
prisoners
into
a
state
illegally,
but
under
the
ker-frisbie
cases,
even
though
the
state
violates
a
federal
law,
the
state
can
try
that
defendant,
and
the
conviction
should
be
affirmed.
the
frisbie
v.
collins
case
is
extremely
relevant
to
this
case.
in
that
case
the
defendant
was
arguing
that
we
have
a
new
law,
a
new
federal
law
which
changes
the
ker
doctrine.
and
this
new
law
says
that
you
can't
kidnap
someone
from
one
state...
that's
the
federal
kidnapping
act
that
was
adopted
by
congress...
and
the
defendant
in
the
frisbie-collins
said
because
of
this
new
statute,
you
can't
kidnap
me
from
illinois
and
take
me
into
another
state
and
try
me
in
the
other
state.
that's
pretty
much
the
argument
here.
you
cannot
violate
the
federal
law,
grab
me
in
michigan,
bring
me
back
and
try
me.
justice
black
rejected
that
argument
and
held
that
there's
nothing...
he
want
on
to
hold
that
there's
nothing
in
the
constitution
that
requires
a
court
to
permit
a
guilty
person,
rightfully
convicted,
to
escape
justice
because
he
was
brought
to
trial
against
his
will.
i
think
if
you
insert
in
that
sentence,
change
"constitution"
to
"interstate
agreement
on
detainers",
you
came
to
the
same
result.
there's
nothing,
there
is
nothing
in
the
interstate
agreement
on
detainers
that
requires
a
court
to
permit
a
person,
guilty
person
rightfully
convicted,
to
escape
justice
because
he
was
brought
to
trial
against
his
will.
a
federal
law
is
a
federal
law,
and
whether
it
is
the
federal
kidnapping
act
or
whether
it's--
mr.
william
earl
daily
--there's
nothing,
i
submit,
in
the
interstate
agreement
on
detainers
which
says
the
receiving...
the
court
in
indiana
has
no
jurisdiction.
it
does
say
in
5(e)
and
5(g)
that
jurisdiction
remains
in
the
sending
state.
but
a
person
can
be
within
the
jurisdiction
of
two
states
or
two
jurisdictions
at
the
same
time.
there
is
nothing
that
says
even
though
jurisdiction
remains
in
michigan
for
certain
purposes
that
jurisdiction
is
not
also
in
the
indiana
court.
mr.
william
earl
daily
exactly,
your
honor.
mr.
william
earl
daily
or
the
civil
action
pending
in
the
district
court.
mr.
william
earl
daily
well,
the
remedy
lies
in
the
civil
action.
mr.
william
earl
daily
i
don't
suggest
that.
in
fact,
i'm--
mr.
william
earl
daily
--it's
a
strange
case,
your
honor.
it
was
brought
against...
strange
case.
it's
pending
here
on
cert,
and
i
wish
you'd
take
a
look
at
it.
[laughter]
the
seventh
circuit...
the
case
was
brought
against
the
officers
who
went
to
michigan
and
brought
him
back.
now,
i
would
assume
that
those
officers,
since
the
petitioner
has
agreed
that
he
was
brought
back
validly
under
470,
it
would
be
hard
to
state
a
claim
against
them.
but
he
is
claiming
that
once
he
gave
them
notice
of
the
fact
that
he
was
going
to
be
tried
on
something
other
than
470,
they
had
some
duty
to
grab
him
out
of
jail
and
take
him
back
to
michigan.
he's
also
suing
the
administrator
of
the
interstate
agreement
on
detainers.
now,
the
seventh
circuit
sent
this
back
to
trial,
so
i
present
it
to
you
with
that
understanding.
mr.
william
earl
daily
well,
i
get
all
excited
about
that
one.
[laughter]
i
get
excited
about
that
one
and
since
the
indiana--
mr.
william
earl
daily
--no.
i'm
sorry,
your
honor.
there
may
be
a
remedy.
i
don't
think
it's
against
the
officers
who
transported
him.
mr.
william
earl
daily
well,
i
think
the
remedy
here
may
be
the
same
as
the
remedy
in
frisbie
v.
collins.
mr.
william
earl
daily
is
there...
that's
not
discussed
in
frisbie
v.
collins.
certainly
the
remedy
in
that
case
was
not
to
retry
the
defendant.
mr.
william
earl
daily
well,
if
this
court
wants
to--
mr.
william
earl
daily
--i
understand
that,
your
honor,
and
it's
a
concern
here
with
me,
too;
that
a
wrong
has
been
committed
for
which
there
may
not
be
a
remedy.
but
the
remedy...
the
wrong
in
frisbie
v.
collins
was
a
kidnapping
rather
than
here
a--
mr.
william
earl
daily
--that...
and
i
think
that
is
the
heart
of
the
petitioner's
argument,
that
there
has
been
some
surrender
of
a
right
here
to
try
the
defendant.
i
don't
find
that
in
the
express
language
of
the
interstate
agreement
on
detainers.
i
don't
find
that
in
the
purposes.
if
you
go
to
the
legislative
purposes
for
which
the
agreement
was
adopted,
i
don't
find
it
there
either.
i
don't--
mr.
william
earl
daily
--that
was--
mr.
william
earl
daily
--yes.
i
argued
that,
and
i
still
maintain
that
it's
michigan
right
to
ensure
a
prompt
return
of
the
prisoner
that's
relevant
here.
i
also
want
to
present
one
more
point
to
your
honor
on
that
question
that
you
asked.
if
violation
of
federal
kidnapping
law
does
not
trigger
some
sort
of
retrial,
i
don't
think
breach
of
a
promise
to
abide
by
the
interstate
agreement
on
detainers
triggers...
triggers
that
retrial
remedy.
in
other
words--
mr.
william
earl
daily
--that's
true.
the...
but
the--
mr.
william
earl
daily
--well,
the
interstate
agreement
on
detainers
says
that
jurisdiction
is
in
michigan.
it
doesn't
deny
that
jurisdiction
can
be
in
other
courts.
this
defendant--
mr.
william
earl
daily
--but
if
read
with
the
following
sentence,
i
think
it
indicates
a
different
intent
on
the
part
of
the
parties
to
the
agreement.
mr.
william
earl
daily
that's
(g),
i'm
sorry.
i'm
talking
about
5(d).
(g)
merely
provides
that
if
he
escapes
while
in
indiana,
he's
subject
to
trial
in
michigan
for
escape.
i
don't
think
it
goes
to
any
of
the
arguments
relevant
here.
it
certainly
doesn't--
mr.
william
earl
daily
--well,
it
certainly
doesn't
say
that
indiana
doesn't
have
jurisdiction.
jurisdiction
had
vested
in
the
indiana
court.
clearly
he
had
been
arraigned.
he
had
entered
a
plea
in
the
indiana
court.
jurisdiction
was
there.
i
don't
find
anything
in
the
interstate
agreement
that
says
we
yanked
jurisdiction
out
of
indiana.
mr.
william
earl
daily
certainly.
mr.
william
earl
daily
well,
i
guess
the
question
then
is
whether
the
indiana
court
has
jurisdiction,
and
i
maintain
that
it
does.
mr.
william
earl
daily
that's
correct,
and
that's
why
we're
here.
this
court
has
acknowledged
that
granting
new
trials
is
an
extreme
remedy,
and
it
doesn't
always
comport
with
the
interest
of
sound
judicial
administration.
that's
a
quote
from
jackson
v.
dence
filed
in
an
amicus
brief
that
i
apologized
for
in
yesterday's
black
v.
romano
case.
we
are
looking
here
at
something
that
comports
with
the
interest
of
sound
judicial
administration,
and
i
think
the
concerns
addressed
or
expressed
from
the
bench
earlier
are
valid
here.
sound
judicial
administration
does
not
require
a
retrial
in
this
case.
the
agreement
doesn't
require
it,
and
sound
judicial
administration
does
not.
i
don't
want
to
leave
without
addressing
the
question
of
whether
or
not
there
is
a
here
an
interstate
compact.
that's
one
of
the
most
important
aspects
in
this
case.
i
want
to
present
here
an
opportunity
to
reconsider
cuyler
v.
adams.
in
1978
mr.
justice
powell
wrote,
"at
this
late
date
we
are
reluctant
to
accept
this
invitation
to
circumscribe
modes
of
interstate
cooperation
that
do
not
enhance
state
power
to
the
detriment
of
federal
supremacy.
"
that
was
in
u.s.
steel
v.
multistate
tax
commission.
they
found
there,
the
court
found
there
no
compact,
no
interstate
compact
because
there
was
no
enhancement
of
state
power
to
the
detriment
of
federal
supremacy.
i
think
had
that
test
been
applied
in
cuyler
v.
adams,
there
would
have
been
a
different
result.
the
cuyler
court,
quoting
from
a
law
review
article
by
justice
frankfurter,
said...
began
by
noting
that
the
traditional
role
of
the
compact
clause
was
to
give
congress
supervisory
power
over
cooperative
state
action
that
might
otherwise
interfere
with
the
full
and
free
exercise
of
federal
authority.
i
think
if
you
had
applied
that
test
to
determine
whether
the
interstate
agreement
on
detainers
interfered
with
the
full
and
free
exercise
of
federal
authority,
you
would
have
come
to
a
different
result.
the
test
actually
adopted
by
this
court
in
cuyler
used
the
language
"appropriate
for
federal
legislation".
i
submit
that
under
the
commerce
clause
and
the
14th
amendment
and
certain
other
provisions
of
the
constitution,
there's
very
little
that's
not
appropriate
in
some
sense,
appropriate
for
federal
legislation.
that's
a
very
broad
test.
appropriate
for
federal
legislation
covers
a
great
many
things
which
do
not
and
have
not
traditionally
been
considered
to
be
interstate
compacts.
in
this
case
had
this
agreement
merely
been
between
indiana
and
michigan,
it
is
still,
i
submit,
in
the
analysis
of
cuyler
v.
adams
appropriate
for
federal
legislation.
the
fact
that
47
other
states
have
entered
into
it
doesn't
change
the
nature
of
the
agreement
or
the
nature
of
the
compact.
the
finding
of
a
broad
compact
clause
application
in
cuyler
v.
adams
leads
the
states
into
a
precarious
situation.
any
agreement
that
we
enter
into
with
another
state,
whether
we
intend
it
to
be
so
or
not,
becomes
an
interstate
compact
if
in
some
sense
it's
appropriate
for
federal
legislation.
i
don't
think
that
was
intended
by
the
compact
clause,
and
i
would
request
this
court
to
reconsider
the
ruling
in
cuyler
v.
adams.
the
only
response
by
the
petitioner
to
that
is
stare
decisis,
but
stare
decisis
has
never
and
should
never
prevent
this
court
from
examining
a
case
which
appears
to
me
to
be
clearly
wrong.
although
the
petitioner
will
not
admit
it,
the
violation
of
the
statute
here
worked
to
his
benefit.
he
was
tried
sooner
than
he
would
have
been
had
he
been
sent
back
to
michigan,
if
that
could
have
been
done.
he
then
began
serving
his
term
here
sooner
than
he
would
ordinarily
have
done.
he
is
due
for
release
next
month
rather
than
several
months
or
several
years
in
the
future,
which
would
have
been
the
case
had
the
agreement
not
been
used
as
it
was
intended
for
the
speedy
disposition
of
pending
criminal
charges.
article
9(1),
i
refer
to
again,
indicates
the
agreement
is
to
be
liberally
construed
so
as
to
effectuate
its
purposes.
the
constructions
proposed
by
the
petitioner
do
not
effectuate
the
purpose
of
the
interstate
agreement
on
detainers.
the
express
terms
of
the
interstate
agreement
on
detainers
do
not
entitle
the
petitioner
to
a
new
trial.
to
paraphrase
justice
black
one
more
time,
there
is
nothing
in
the
interstate
agreement
on
detainers
that
requires
a
court
to
permit
a
guilty
person,
rightfully
convicted,
to
escape
justice.
thank
you.
