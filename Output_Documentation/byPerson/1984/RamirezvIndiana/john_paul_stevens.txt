justice
stevens
may
i
interrupt
before
you
do?
in
one
of
justice
o'connor's
questions
she
raised
the
question
whether
the
judgment
was
with
prejudice
or
not;
and
i
had
not
understood
that
the
judgment
was
void,
that
you
were
taking
the
position
that
it
would
bar
further
prosecution.
justice
stevens
well,
do
you
mean
so
that
he
couldn't
ever
be
tried?
justice
stevens
thank
you
very
much
for--
--you
don't
have
to
apologize
for
that.
[laughter]
justice
stevens
counsel,
they
didn't
say
it
wasn't
a
detainer,
but
they
did
that
its
presence
on
the
424
charges
was
obtained
outside
the
agreement.
didn't
they
say
that?
justice
stevens
i
see.
justice
stevens
what
was
the
violation
by
indiana?
justice
stevens
but
you
do
acknowledge
there
was
a
violation
by
indiana.
justice
stevens
--yes,
but
if
your
view
of
that
case
is
correct,
you're
in
effect
saying
there
isn't
any
real
remedy
unless
you
find
a
remedy
in
this
case.
justice
stevens
but
what...
i'm
a
little
puzzled
about
what
it
would
be.
i've
shared
justice
white's
puzzlement
about
this.
justice
stevens
but
there's
nothing,
isn't
it?
justice
stevens
but
the
only
damage
to
this
person
that
he's
been
convicted,
and
yet
you're
saying
the
conviction
is
valid.
i
don't
know
how
you
can
get
damage
for
being
validly
convicted
of
something
you
did.
justice
stevens
i
just--
justice
stevens
--well,
i
understand
that,
but
arguably
isn't
there
a
difference
that
here
if
you
have...
perhaps
one
could
read
the
interstate
agreement
on
detainers
to
be
a
surrender
by
each
of
the
contracting
states
of
some
element
of
jurisdiction
it
would
otherwise
possess.
it,
in
effect,
has
agreed
not
to
exercise
jurisdiction
in
certain
classes
of
cases.
you
didn't
have
that
element
in
the
frisbie
situation.
