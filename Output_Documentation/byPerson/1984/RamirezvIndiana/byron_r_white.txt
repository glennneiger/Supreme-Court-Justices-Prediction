justice
white
you
think
i
don't
know
them.
justice
white
you
say
they
are
facts
not
of
record?
justice
white
mr.
ripple,
what
if
he
hadn't
agreed
voluntarily
to
leave
michigan?
i
suppose
he
could
have
been
brought
against
his
will
over.
justice
white
well,
nevertheless,
he
could
have
been...
if
these
procedures...
if
they'd
gone
through
the
right
procedures,
he
could
have
been
extradited--
justice
white
--all
right.
suppose
that
had
happened,
and
then
the
same
thing
happened
at
trial.
do
you
think
the
governor
could
have
treated
that
later
second
paper
as
a
request
for
extradition?
justice
white
there's
a
lot
easier
way
of
clearing
the
books
than
getting
the
fellow
back
and
trying
him
and
sentencing
to
a
concurrent.
they
could
just
dismiss
the
charges,
if
his
likely
sentence
in
indiana
was
going
to
be
no
more
than
what
it
was
in
michigan.
justice
white
but
the
submission
is
that
he
was
brought
to
trial
by
a
court
that
didn't
have
any
jurisdiction
to
bring
him
to
trial.
justice
white
so
you
just
think
that
the
way
to
decide
this
case
is
just
follow
frisbie.
justice
white
and
that
indiana's
violation
will
just
have
to
be
left
to
history
to
cure.
justice
white
but
there's
just
no
remedy
otherwise.
justice
white
well,
what
do
you
do?
you
sue
them
for
having
convicted
me
illegally?
that's
a
very
strange
suggestion.
justice
white
what
does
the
1983
case...
what
does
it
allege?
justice
white
mr.
ripple,
what
would
really
be
the
purpose
of
setting
aside,
having
this
conviction
set
aside?
certainly
i
can't
see
how
it
is
going
to
help
your
client.
i
would
suppose
it
would
just
be
a
signal
to
the
states
to
turn
square
corners
in
the
future.
justice
white
there
are
other
ways
of
doing
that
besides
setting
aside
the
criminal
conviction,
i
suppose.
justice
white
the
indiana
officials
who
made
the
mistakes,
or
the
michigan
people
who
made
the
mistakes
could
be
fired
or
they
could
be...
they
will
learn
what
their
duties
are.
they'll
learn
how
to
do
their
job.
