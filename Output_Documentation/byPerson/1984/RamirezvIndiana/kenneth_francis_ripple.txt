mr.
kenneth
francis
ripple
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
is
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
of
the
state
of
indiana.
it
presents
a
single
question
with
respect
to
the
interpretation
of
the
interstate
agreement
on
detainers.
the
court
must
decide
whether
indiana
could
try
the
petitioner
on
a
charge
which
was
not
mentioned
in
the
detainer
used
to
obtain
his
temporary
and
limited
custody
from
the
penal
authorities
of
the
state
of
michigan.
the
facts
of
this
case
are
complicated,
and
i
would
like
to
state
very
succinctly
the
essence
of
our
position
on
that
question
before
i
spend
a
good
deal
of
time
on
the
facts,
which
i
think
are
difficult
to
grasp.
in
essence,
our
submission
is
that
this
question
can
be
answered
by
a
straightforward
of
the
iad.
the
trial
court
of
the
receiving
state...
in
this
case
indiana...
only
has
authority
to
try
a
prisoner
on
those
charges
mentioned
in
the
detainer
or
on
those
charges
which
arise
out
of
the
same
transaction
as
those
charges
mentioned
in
the
detainer.
for
all
other
purposes
the
sending
state...
in
this
case
the
state
of
michigan...
retains
both
custody
and
jurisdiction
of
the
prisoner.
mr.
kenneth
francis
ripple
my
client
at
the
present
time
is
in
westphil
correctional
institution
in
indiana.
mr.
kenneth
francis
ripple
no,
your
honor,
he
has
not.
and
this
might
be
a
good
time
for
me
to
inform
the
court
of
several
factors
i
was
going
to
bring
up
later,
probably
in
the--
mr.
kenneth
francis
ripple
--michigan...
if
i
may
give
you
these
facts
first,
i
think
they
will
partially--
mr.
kenneth
francis
ripple
--answer
your...
answer
your--
mr.
kenneth
francis
ripple
--well,
michigan
could...
michigan's
governor
had
a
right
to
make
a
determination
in
this
case
before
he
sent
the
petitioner
across
the
line
to
stand
charges,
to
stand
trial
on
the
diazepam
charges.
that
right
is
given
to
the
governor
of
michigan--
mr.
kenneth
francis
ripple
--michigan
is
not
complaining
here.
it
is...
and
one
would
not
expect
in
the
direct
appeal
of
the
criminal
case
that
michigan
could
be
the
complainant.
whether
michigan
has
complained
to
the
authorities
of
indiana
is
not
in
the
record,
and
we
don't
know
whether
they
have
or
have
not.
mr.
kenneth
francis
ripple
they
should
complain
because
the
interstate
agreement
in
fact
was
violated.
mr.
kenneth
francis
ripple
that's
correct.
mr.
kenneth
francis
ripple
but
michigan
and
the
other
states
of
the
union
must
in
fact
live
with
the
uncertainty
of
knowing
that
indiana
will
not
abide
by
this
agreement
as
it
was
set
up.
the
facts,
mr.
justice,
if
i
may
give
them
to
you
at
this
time,
because
i
think
they
are
not
of
record.
they
are
after
the--
mr.
kenneth
francis
ripple
--i
am
not
sure,
sir,
but
i
believe
it's
my
obligation
to
formally
inform
the
court
of--
mr.
kenneth
francis
ripple
--they
are
subsequent
to
trial,
but
i
think
pertinent
to
the
disposition
of
the
case,
and
i
think,
therefore,
i
have
an
obligation
to
inform
the
court
of
them.
after
trial
on
june
6,
1930...
1982,
the
petitioner
was
in
fact
paroled
into
the
custody
of
the
state
of
indiana
and
was
incarcerated
by
the
state
of
indiana.
on
the
second...
i'm
sorry...
on
february
19th,
1984,
michigan
in
fact
discharged
the
petitioner
from
his
sentence
to
incarceration
in
the
state
of
michigan.
he
therefore
continued
his
incarceration
in
the
state
of
indiana.
he
is
due
for
release
on
april
24th
of
the
current
year,
but
will
be
subject
to
probation
for
one
additional
year.
i
am
indebted
to
my
colleagues
from
the
state
for
helping
me
obtain
that
information,
and
i
thought
i
had
a
duty
to
the
court
to
mention
that
to
you.
again,
our
basic
position
is
that
for
all
purposes
other
than
the
charges
mentioned
in
the
detainer,
the
prisoner
remains
subject
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
sending
state;
that
therefore,
in
this
case
the
trial
court
in
indiana
was
without
authority
to
try
the
petitioner
on
the
diazepam
charges
and,
as
a
result,
its
judgment
of
conviction
is
void.
now,
the
facts
of
the
case
are
difficult
to
get
a
grasp
on
because
they
cover
a
long
period
of
time.
and
i
suggest
to
the
court
it
would
be
helpful
if
the
following
factors
were
kept
in
mind
as
i
go
through
them.
first
of
all,
indiana
has
incrementally
recognized
the
correctness
of
the
straightforward
approach
i
have
just
suggested.
indeed,
the
basic
error
in
this
proceeding,
now
admitted
by
indiana,
could
have
very
easily
been
corrected
at
an
earlier
stage
in
these
proceedings.
we
are
only
here
today
because
despite
its
confession
of
error,
the
state
of
indiana
refuses
to
give
up
the
product
of
its
earlier
overreaction:
the
void
conviction
of
the
petitioner.
we
submit
that
this
reluctance
of
the
state
of
indiana
is
indeed
contrary
to
their
own
best
interests
as
signatories
to
the
interstate
agreement
on
detainers.
now,
we
have
set
forth
the
operative
facts
in
summary
fashion
on
pages
2
and
3
of
our
brief
and
in
more
plenary
fashion
at
pages
3
through
8.
the
facts
involve
what
we
in
indiana
call
two
criminal
causes.
the
first
cause,
section
424,
involves
three
charges
of
dealing
with
a
controlled
substance
called
diazepam.
the
second
cause,
cause
470,
deals
with
delivery
of
marijuana.
now,
the
underlying
events
with
respect
to
the
first
of
those
causes,
the
diazepam
cause...
that's
the
cause
we
contend
he
should
not
have
been
tried
upon...
took
place
over
a
three-month
period
in
early
1979.
and
the
petitioner
was
arraigned
on
those
charges
in
april
of
1979.
now,
as
we've
noted
in
some
detail
in
our
brief
at
page
4,
he
initially
pleaded
guilty...
not
guilty
to
those
charges,
and
then
later
attempted
to
plead
guilty
pursuant
to
a
plea
agreement.
but
the
trial
judge
refused
to
accept
the
plea
agreement,
because
he
considered
the
plea
to
be
improvident.
the
trial
was
set
eventually
for
march
1980
but
later
continued.
before
trial
was
had
on
that
first
diazepam
cause,
the
one
which
is
in
question
here,
the
petitioner
was
arraigned
in
may
of
1980
on
the
second
cause,
the
marijuana
cause.
the
underlying
events
with
respect
to
that
cause
took
place
in
december
1979,
almost
12
months
after
the
underlying
events
for
the
first
cause,
and
therefore,
there
is
no
question
that
they
were
not
in
any
way
related
crimes,
and
no
one
has
contended
that.
in
november
1980,
after
he
had
been
arraigned
on
both
causes
but
not
tried
on
either,
the
petitioner
was
incarcerated
by
the
state
of
michigan
pursuant
to
an
unrelated
felony
charge.
in
march
1981,
after
he
had
been
in
michigan
incarceration
for
several
months,
the
prosecutor
from
howard
county,
indiana
mailed
to
the
warden
of
the
prison
in
jackson,
michigan
a
detainer
which
indicated
that
he
wished
to
bring
the
petitioner
to
trial
on
two
counts
of
dealing
in
marijuana.
now,
if
i
may
anticipate
a
question
at
this
point,
it
ought
to
be
noted
that
one
of
the
follow-up
documents
which
was
sent
to
michigan
to
obtain
temporary
custody
of
the
petitioner
several
months
after
the
actual
detainer
was
filed
erroneously
listed
the
cause
number
for
the
diazepam
counts,
and
said
the
petitioner
was
wanted
on
three
counts
of
dealing
in
marijuana.
now,
at
trial
the
state
of
indiana
contended
that
this
in
fact
was
an
independent
detainer
with
respect
to
the
diazepam
counts.
the
court
of
appeals
of
indiana
in
its
opinion...
and
you'll
note
this
at
the
joint
appendix
page
168...
said
that
no
reasonable
factfinder
could
reach
that
conclusion.
and
i
note
that
the
state
of
indiana
has
in
fact
dropped
that
contention
at
this
point.
so
in
short,
having
been
told
that
he
was
going
to
return
to
indiana
to
stand
trial
on
two
counts
of
delivery
of
marijuana,
the
petitioner
waived
his
rights
under
article
4
of
the
iad,
came
across
the
border
and...
in
the
custody
of
indiana
authorities.
he
came
across
on
july
21st,
1981
from
jackson
prison
in
indiana
over
to
howard
county,
city
of
kokomo
in
indiana.
that's
northcentral
indiana.
on
july
23rd
he
did
file
with
the
court
a
suggested
plea
bargain
with
respect
to
the
diazepam
cause
on
the
ground,
but
later
withdrew
it,
and
he
filed
a
motion
to
dismiss
on
the
ground
that
he
had
been
brought
across
the
border
unwittingly
with
respect
to
the
diazepam
charges.
mr.
kenneth
francis
ripple
under
article
4
of
the
interstate
agreement,
mr.
justice
white,
he
had
the
right
to
request
a
hearing
under
the
uniform
extradition
act,
and
he
also
had
a
right
to
request
that
the
governor
of
michigan
not
honor
the
extradition
request,
which--
mr.
kenneth
francis
ripple
--if
they
had
gone
through
the
correct
procedures.
mr.
kenneth
francis
ripple
on
the
diazepam
charges?
no,
your
honor,
i
do
not
believe
so
because,
as
the
court
of
appeals
of
indiana
stated,
it
simply
did
not
put
either
the
prisoner
or
the
governor
on
notice
that
in
fact
he
was
wanted
on
those
charges.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
if
i
may
invite
your
attention
to
defense
exhibits
4
and
5
in
the
record,
michigan
later
by
letter
verified
that
their
understanding
was...
the
michigan
authorities
were
under
the
understanding
that
only
the
delivery
of
marijuana
charges
were
at
issue,
that
they
did
not
know
anything
about
these
diazepam
causes.
i
believe--
mr.
kenneth
francis
ripple
--no.
justice
o'connor,
first
of
all,
your
question
really
has
two
parts
to
it.
it
is
our
submission
that
section...
that
sections
5(d)
and
5(g)
of
the
interstate
agreement
do
in
fact
indicate
exactly
what
the
remedy
ought
to
be,
and
that
is,
the
judgment
is
void
and
therefore
cannot
stand.
in
its
brief
in
the
court
of
appeals
of
indiana,
although
not
in
this
court,
the
state
of
indiana
did
note
the
lack
of
remedial
language
in
section
5(g).
but
i
submit
we
really
ought
not
to
expect
that
there
would
be
remedial
language
in
5(g).
the
drafters
of
the
iad,
like
the
drafters
of
any
statute,
do
their
work
against
a
general
jurisprudence.
when
you
say
that
a
court
has
no
jurisdiction,
it
is
well
understood
in
our
law
that
in
fact
its
handiwork
is
void;
it
has
no
effect.
mr.
kenneth
francis
ripple
i
think,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
that
an
entire
reading
of
the
interstate
agreement
on
detainers,
especially
article
i,
indicates
that
they
were
aware
of
ker
and
frisbie
and
in
fact
were
trying
to
establish
a
system
substantially
different
from
ker
and
frisbie
that
would
bring
a
certain
amount
of
certainty
and
comity
to
an
area
which
otherwise
would
not
be
governed
by
ker
and
frisbie.
mr.
kenneth
francis
ripple
i
think
there
are
two
points
that
need
to
be
made
on
this.
first
of
all,
that
remedy
is
not
unknown
in
our
law.
that's
standard
practice,
for
instance,
under
the
uniform
act
to
secure
the
attendance
of
witnesses.
if
a
person
has
immunity
to
be
in
a
jurisdiction
to
testify
at
a
criminal
trial
and
you
serve...
and
you
process
on
him
that
you
shouldn't,
that
process
is
void,
the
proceedings
are
void.
he
has
a
chance
to
return
to
the
state
from
whence
he
came,
and
you
extradite
him
again.
it's
wasted
judicial
energy,
but
it's
wasted
judicial
energy
because
of
the
error
of
the
state.
indeed,
in
this
case,
as
i
indicated
earlier,
the
state...
we
were
in
a
position
at
trial
to
remedy
this
in
a
very
easy
sort
of
way,
and
indeed,
if
our
position
here
is
upheld,
this
will
be
remedied
very
easily
in
the
future.
in
reading
through
the
entire
motion
to
dismiss
you
will
notice
that
both
counsel
for
the
accused
at
trial
and
counsel
for
the
state
at
trial
both
suggested
an
alternate
remedy
to
the
trial
judge
at
trial;
that
in
fact
he
could
have
severed
the
two
causes
at
trial,
proceeded
with
the
marijuana
cause,
and
permitted
both
the
petitioner
and
the
state
of
michigan
to
exercise
their
rights
under
the
iad.
it
would
have
amounted
to
at
most
a
31-day
lapse
of
time,
and
they
could
have
tried
the
man
on
this
second
charge
again.
now,
if
i
may
return
just
for
a
moment--
mr.
kenneth
francis
ripple
--we
have,
mr.
justice,
in
this
case
because
it
has
gone
on
for
so
long
and
because
the
facts
of
the
situation
have
changed,
we
have
a
rather
unusual
circumstance.
our
position
is,
number
one,
that
the
judgment
of
conviction
is
void
because
it
was
entered
by
a
court
which
had
no
authority
to
act
with
respect
to
that
cause.
if
this
had
happened,
for
instance,
at
the
court
of
appeals
of
indiana
level,
it
may
well
have
been
proper
to
reverse
the
conviction,
require
that
indiana
send
the
man
back
to
michigan,
and
that
the
interstate
agreement
on
detainers
in
fact
be
followed.
here
we
don't
have
that
option,
because
he's
been
discharged
in
michigan.
we
submit
that
under
those
circumstances,
at
the
very
least
michigan
needs
to...
or
rather
indiana
needs
to
retry
the
petitioner.
this
conviction
cannot
stand.
but
we
also
submit
since
this
is
in
fact
a...
the
situation
has
changed
not
at
our
hands...
we
timely
raised
this
at
trial...
but
at
the
hands
of
the
state
which
overreacted
at
trial,
that
indeed
this
ought
to
be
dismissed
with
prejudice
at
this
point.
mr.
kenneth
francis
ripple
yes,
your
honor,
in
this
particular
case.
mr.
kenneth
francis
ripple
we
submit
that
that
is
at
least
the
minimum
that
ought
to
occur.
the
conviction
cannot
stand.
the
judgment
must
be
reversed.
that
we
submit
there
are
two
alternatives
which
the
court
ought
to
consider
with
respect
to
what
happens
at
that
point.
assuming
that
that
question--
mr.
kenneth
francis
ripple
--well,
it
may
very
well
be
impossible
for
the
man
to
get
a
fair
trial
at
this
point,
to
defend
himself
at
this
point,
among
other
points,
justice
o'connor.
if
i
may
return
to
your
question
for
just
a
moment,
because
i
don't
think
i
completely
answered
it,
with
respect
to
why
there's
no
remedial
actual
remedy
spelled
out
here,
but
there
is
for
the
other...
in
other
areas
of
the
iad,
my
submission
is
we
would
not
expect
it
here,
because
the
general
jurisprudence
indicates
that
a
court
without
authority
has
a
void
judgment.
that's
not
true
in
the
other
areas
where
a
remedy
is
actually
spelled
out.
in
those
areas
we're
dealing
with
the
thou
shalt
nots
of
the
iad.
but
the
general
jurisprudence
really
gives
no
answer
and
where
one
would
expect
the
drafters
to
have
to
specify
exactly
what
they
did
mean.
mr.
kenneth
francis
ripple
he
was
also
prejudiced
by
being
charged...
by
being
tried
by
a
court
which
did
not
have
authority
to
enter
a
judgment
of
conviction
against
him
and
give
him
a
consecutive
sentence
with
respect
to
the
charge.
that
indeed
was
prejudice
as
well.
and
indeed,
in
other
areas
of
the
law
we
acknowledge
the
fact
that
a
party
can
be
prejudiced
that
way.
in
world-wide
volkswagen
against
woodson
the
court
indicated,
for
instance,
that
a
defendant
might
in
fact
not
be
subject
unwillingly
to
the
civil
jurisdiction,
even
it
it
was
not
fundamentally
unfair
to
that
defendant
if
indeed
interstate
federalism
concerns
had
been
violated
by
the
court's
exercise
of
jurisdiction.
we
all
at
times
depend
on
legal
process
which
perhaps
was
not
developed
exclusively
for
our
benefit.
here
this
was
clearly
developed
for
his
benefit,
as
well
as
for
the
state
of
michigan's
benefit,
and
for
the
benefit
of
the
interstate
system.
and
it
is
on
that
ground
that
this
particular
jurisdictional...
that
this
particular
really
immunity
existed
for
him
from
the
exercise
of
the
court's
jurisdiction
at
that
point.
mr.
kenneth
francis
ripple
it
had
jurisdiction
over
him
for
the
lesser
charge.
mr.
kenneth
francis
ripple
that's
correct.
and
as
we
pointed
out
in
our
brief...
i
believe
it's
at
page
23,
if
i'm
not
mistaken...
we
are
not
claiming
that
there
was
no
residual
jurisdiction
with
respect
to
the
diazepam
charge.
we
are
contending
that
at
the
time
this
court
attempted
to
exercise
this
jurisdiction,
it
was
prevented
from
doing
so
by
virtue
of
the
interstate
agreement
on
detainers
which
says
you
will
not
exercise
your
normal
criminal
jurisdiction
under
these
circumstances.
mr.
kenneth
francis
ripple
we
make
no
claim
that
there
was
purposeful
deception
by
the
state
of
indiana
ab
initio.
we
feel
that
indiana
is
more
at
fault
here
for
having
perpetuated
the
problem
at
trial
by
taking
what
we
suggest
was
an
unreasonable
position
during
the
motion
to
dismiss.
indeed,
if
the
trial...
if
the
state
had
acknowledged
in
the
trial
court
what
it
now
acknowledges,
that
there
was
a
violation
of
the
iad,
we
wouldn't
be
faced
with
the
delicate
task
of
talking
about
a
remedy
for
this
particular
accused
today.
the
trial
judge
could
have
severed
these
causes.
he
could
have
proceeded.
he
could
have
tried
the
marijuana
cause.
he
could
have
tried
the
diazepam
cause
about
a
month
later.
there
would
not
have
been
a
problem.
section
5(b)
and
section
5(g),
we
submit,
when
they
are
read
together
clearly
indicate
what
the
result
ought
to
be.
this
prisoner
in
effect
was
on
loan
from
the
state
of
michigan,
on
loan
for
a
very
temporary
and
specific
purpose,
and
the
jurisdiction
of
the
state
of
indiana
was
limited
by
the
terms
of
that
law.
in
fact,
we
know...
it's
our
reading
of
the
state's
brief
that
they
really
do
not
dispute
that
reading
of
the
statute;
thus,
in
effect,
narrowing
even
further
the
difference
between
us.
the
state's
concern
at
this
point
seems
to
be
in
maintaining
this
particular
conviction,
and
we
submit
that's
an
understandable
but
rather
shortsighted
goal.
the
state
of
indiana,
like
every
other
state
in
the
union,
has
an
overwhelming
interest
in
seeing
that
the
interstate
agreement
on
detainers
is
in
fact
observed
according
to
its
expressed
terms.
indiana
joined
this
compact
for
the
same
reason
the
other
47
states
did:
to
accommodate
the
daily
interreaction
of
state
governments
in
this
very
important
area
of
the
interstate
rendition
of
prisoners.
as
this
court
pointed
out
in
its
past
cases
in
this
area,
the
iad
protects
not
only
the
criminally
accused;
it
also
protects
the
federal
system.
it
protects
our
interstate
federalism.
whatever
the
long-term
vitality
of
the
ker-frisbie
rule
might
be
in
other
contexts...
and
in
a
footnote
in
our
brief
we
suggested
that
it's
not
entirely
compatible
with
some
of
the
later
holdings
of
this
court...
you
don't
need
to
reach
that
question
today.
it's
clear
that
here
in
this
area
the
states
intended
to
adopt
a
far
more
cooperative
approach.
the
states
don't
need
the
kind
of
flexibility
which
indiana
has
suggested.
it
is
indeed
unusual,
we
suggest,
that
the
state
of
indiana
stands
here
alone
today.
we
don't
see
an
amicus
brief
from
the
other
states
of
the
union
saying
this
is
how
we
want
this
interstate
compact
administered.
mr.
kenneth
francis
ripple
they
are
not,
and
i
don't
think
you
would
expect,
mr.
justice,
that
they
would
be
here
in
support
of
the
criminal--
mr.
kenneth
francis
ripple
--well,
we
would
respectfully,
i
think,
disagree
on
that
point.
for
that
reason,
your
honors,
we
submit
that
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
of
indiana
ought
to
be
reversed.
mr.
kenneth
francis
ripple
please,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court:
very
briefly,
we
believe
there's
a
single
theme
in
indiana's
approach
to
this
case:
a
lack
of
acknowledgement
of
its
federal
responsibility.
it
argues
to
the
empty
chair
of
michigan
in
this
direct
criminal
appeal
that
it
had
the
responsibility
towards
seeing...
was
indeed
conducted
in
accordance
with
the
interstate
agreement--
mr.
kenneth
francis
ripple
--i
think
he
would
at
least
have
the
opportunity
to
be
tried
by
a
court
which
had
jurisdiction,
and
that
might
be
very
important
to
him
if
indiana
elects
not
to
try
him
in
light
of
the
habitual
statute
in
indiana
should
he
ever
be
in
trouble
with
the
law
again.
and
as
you
suggest,
mr.
justice
white,
it
is
important
to
the
law
that
we
prevail
in
this
case
certainly.
there
is
one
message--
mr.
kenneth
francis
ripple
--and
you
could
permit
new
trial,
and
indiana
would
have
to
bear
that
responsibility.
mr.
kenneth
francis
ripple
although
we
submit
that's
impossible
in
the
context
of
this
case,
that
indeed
a
1983
remedy
would
not
be...
it
would
not
make
the
petitioner
whole.
uncertainty
is
what
indiana
argues
here
for,
uncertainty
for
the
sending
state.
it
will
never
again
know
why
it
is
sending
someone
across
the
border.
uncertainty
for
the
prisoner.
he
won't
know
whether
to
waive
his
rights
or
not,
because
he
doesn't
know
what's
going
to
happen
to
him
when
he
gets
across
the
line.
and
uncertainty
for
every
other
state
in
the
union
and
the
federal
government,
because
they
no
longer
will
know
whether
or
not
the
states
will
abide
by
the
agreement
they
freely
entered
into
here.
in
short,
indiana
argues
for
wax
teeth
for
this
agreement;
and
we
respectfully
submit
that
it
is
in
the
best
interests
of
the
state
of
indiana
that
our
position
on
the
law
prevail
here.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
