justice
white
mr.
wallace,
would
you
say
if
the
state
public
utility
commission
had
said,
we
will
only
accept
joint
filings,
that
that
would
be
enough?
justice
white
just
in
your
own
words,
the
private
carriers
are
not
making
the
choice.
justice
white
well,
if
the
public
utility
commissions
said
all
you
fellows
have
got
to
get
together
and
file
joint
rates,
that
is--
justice
white
--what
other
ground,
would
you
say?
justice
white
i
didn't
think
you...
what
is
your
position
in
the
hallie
case?
didn't
you
say
that
you
didn't
need
active
supervision
of
municipalities?
justice
white
but
you
think
you
have
to
have
active
supervision
by
rate
bureaus,
i
mean
by--
justice
white
--no,
public
utilities
commissions.
justice
white
but
anyway,
that
is
not
involved
here?
justice
white
it
bound
everybody.
justice
white
it
bound
everybody.
it
bound
100
percent.
justice
white
and
that
was
an
imposed
state
policy
at
that
point.
justice
white
but
here
there
would
be
no
state
policy
violated
if
no
one
files
joint
rates.
justice
white
and
the
public
utility
commission
doesn't
ask
them
to
file
joint
rates,
doesn't
penalize
them
if
they
don't.
justice
white
how
do
they
do
that?
justice
white
well,
is
that
covered
in
your
brief?
justice
white
are
there
regulations
that
say
that
you
have
to
file
joint
rates?
justice
white
well,
what
happens
to
the
fellow
who
doesn't
file
a
joint
rate?
is
he
violating
the
regulation?
justice
white
well,
neither
would
anybody
else.
