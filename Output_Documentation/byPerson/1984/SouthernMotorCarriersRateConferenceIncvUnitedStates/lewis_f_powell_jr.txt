--mr.
wallace,
i
am
sure
you
would
concede
that
the
public
utility
commissions
are
not
private,
would
you
not?
justice
jr.
and
they
certainly
have
the
final
authority
with
respect
to
the
rates,
do
they
not?
justice
jr.
yes.
justice
jr.
i
was
addressing
my
question
to
what
seemed
to
me
to
be
your
argument
that
you
had
a
wholly
private
antitrust
situation.
justice
jr.
my
recollection
of
cantor
is
that...
i
forget
now
who
made
this
suggestion.
it
may
have
been
the
dissent.
but
the
commission
actually
took
a
rather
neutral
position
with
respect
to
lightbulbs,
which
seems
quite
different
from
rates,
certainly
different
in
degrees.
may
i
ask
you
one
final
question,
perhaps
not
a
legal
one,
but
is
the
government,
the
united
states
troubled
at
all
by
the
fact
that
if
we
agree
with
you
that
a
policy
consistently
followed
by
most
states
for
30
to
40
years
would
be
declared
unlawful
and
individual
rates
would
have
to
be
filed?
justice
jr.
but
it
bound
everybody.
