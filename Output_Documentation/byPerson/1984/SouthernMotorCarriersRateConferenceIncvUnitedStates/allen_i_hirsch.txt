mr.
allen
i.
hirsch
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
while
there
are
many
directions
one
can
take
when
answering
the
question
posed
by
this
case
in
a
manner
which
would
be
favorable
to
the
petitioners,
the
question
itself,
we
believe,
is
rather
simply
put:
does
a
state's
clearly
articulated
and
affirmatively
expressed
policy
to
displace
competition
with
a
mandatory
and
pervasive
regulatory
system
which
it
actively
supervises
shield
from
antitrust
liability
the
private
regulated
parties
acting
in
a
manner
contemplated
and
authorized
but
not
literally
compelled
by
the
state
system?
in
order
to
answer
this
question,
it
is
useful
not
only
to
examine
the
state
action
doctrine
as
it
commenced
with
parker
v.
brown
and
as
it
has
been
discussed
by
this
court
in
subsequent
opinions,
but
to
look
closely
at
the
underlying
concept
of
federalism
upon
which
parker
v.
brown
was
based.
to
begin
this
examination,
we
should
look
briefly
at
the
state
regulatory
systems
as
well
as
the
pertinent
federal
statutes
in
this
area.
each
state
in
this
case
has
legislatively
mandated
regulation
of
motor
carriers
with
pervasive
regulatory
schemes
setting
forth
what
the
motor
carrier
operators
must
do
in
order
to
comply
with
the
state
schemes
and
in
order
to
be
motor
carriers
within
the
state
bounds.
each
state
has
established
a
public
service
commission
to
administer
that
regulation
in
order
to
achieve
these
legislatively
articulated
purposes
and
goals
for
the
benefit
of
the
public
and
the
citizens
of
those
states.
on
the
federal
level,
at
the
same
time,
the
congress
of
the
united
states
first
in
1935
specifically
reserved
to
the
states
the
right
to
regulate
motor
carriers
within
their
state
boundaries,
and
subsequently
in
1948
the
congress
of
the
united
states
specifically
exempted
activity
which
if
not
identical
is
very,
very
similar
when
engaged
in
by
interstate
motor
carriers
subject
to
the
regulation
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission.
the
unique
aspect
of
this
case
is
that
under
the
federal
scheme,
in
order
to
avail
oneself
of
the
exemption
from
the
federal
antitrust
laws,
carriers
had
to
petition
the
interstate
commerce
commission
for
a
collective
agreement,
and
in
order
to
receive
the
exemption
by
use
of
this
agreement,
they
had
to
reserve
the
right
to
independent
action
by
each
of
the
carriers
who
were
parties
to
the
agreement.
what
the
government
proposes
in
this
situation
is
that
contrary
to
the
federal
scheme
which
required
the
reservation
of
the
right
to
independent
action
in
order
to
obtain
relief
from
the
antitrust
laws,
that
the
states,
because
they
do
not
remove
that
right,
because
they
do
not
compel
collective
activity,
but
only
allow
and
authorize
collective
activity
while
still
allowing
this
independent
action,
have
lost
the
right
to
exemption
from
the
antitrust
laws.
we
submit
that
in
the
context
of
this
case,
pervasive
regulatory
schemes
coupled
with
this
federal
background
of
an
explicit
reservation
to
the
states
of
the
right
to
regulate
in
this
area,
and
congressional
action
in
the
same
arena
attempting
to
accomplish
the
same
goals,
and
not
to
allow
the
states
to
do
the
same,
is
to
stand
the
doctrine
of
federalism
on
its
head.
now,
under
the
doctrine
of
federalism
as
addressed
in
parker
v.
brown,
this
court
has
stated
in
the
oft
quoted
phrase
that
when
we
are
dealing
in
a
system
of
dual
sovereignty,
where
the
federal
government
is
a
sovereign
and
the
state
is
a
sovereign,
it
is
not
easily
to
be
implied
that
the
federal
government
has
intended
to
remove
the
state
right
to
act
and
to
subject
it
to
federal
law.
in
this
case
when
we
couple
this
proposition
of
the
parker
case
with
the
specific
reservation
of
the
right
to
the
states
to
regulate
in
this
area,
we
believe
that
this
substantiates
the
position
that
the
federal
congress
does
not
intend
to
apply
the
sherman
act
in
this
area.
in
parker
you
had
no
statement
of
a
reservation
of
rights
to
the
states
to
regulate
their
agricultural
crops.
they
went
ahead
and
regulated.
in
fact,
in
parker
there
was
federal
legislation
which
was
comparable
to
the
regulation
that
was
being
engaged
in
by
the
state
itself.
in
this
case,
we
don't
deal
with
just
the
silence
of
the
congress
of
the
united
states
in
the
sherman
act
with
respect
to
its
applicability
to
the
states.
we
deal
with
the
subsequent
explicit
statement
of
the
intent
of
the
congress
of
the
united
states
not
to
apply
the
federal
laws
to
the
states
when
it
comes
to
the
regulation
of
motor
carriers.
in
this
arena,
we
then
turn
to
the
state
action
doctrine,
and
see
if
the
doctrine
as
evolved
by
this
court
does
apply
in
fact
to
the
regulatory
schemes
of
the
states
we
have
before
you.
the
issue
has
evolved
over
the
term
compulsion,
that
the
activity
in
question
when
engaged
in
by
a
private
party
must
be
compelled
by
the
state.
we
believe
this
is
a
narrow
and
wooden
approach
to
the
state
action
doctrine.
we
believe
that
the
state
action
doctrine
means
exactly
what
it
says.
does
the
state
as
a
sovereign
intend
to
occupy
a
particular
field
and
regulate
that
field
to
the
extent
of
displacing
competition?
and
is
that
intention
clearly
stated,
clearly
articulated?
and
when
dealing
with
private
parties
who
are
necessary
to
the
realization
of
the
regulatory
goals
set
forth
by
the
regulatory
scheme,
whether
the
state
merely
says,
go
do
as
you
will,
or
whether
the
state
remains
actively
involved--
mr.
allen
i.
hirsch
--yes,
sir.
mr.
allen
i.
hirsch
no,
sir,
they
have
not.
mr.
allen
i.
hirsch
no,
what
they
have
said
to
the
carriers
is
this.
they
have
said,
you
must
submit
any
rate
that
you
intend
to
charge
or
wish
to
charge
to
the
public
service
commission
of
this
state
for
review
and
interpretation
and
examination,
and
unless
and
until
that
rate
or
a
modification
of
that
rate
is
issued
by
the
public
service
commission,
you
can't
do
anything.
under
that
scheme,
the
states
have
then
further
said,
we
wish
to
assist
the
public
service
commission
in
realizing
this
ratesetting
charge
that
we
have
given
them,
that
we
have
delegated
to
the
public
service
commission.
they
need
the
assistance
of
the
carriers
coupled
with
this
assistance.
each
of
the
states
has
expressed
a
desire
to
have
uniformity
with
respect
to
rates
charged.
each
of
the
five
states
appeared
in
the
district
court
at
the
invitation
of
the
court
and
supported
thoroughly
the
activity
in
question,
stating
not
only
was
the
activity
advantageous
to
their
carrying
out
their
legislative
goals,
but
was
necessary
to
the
carrying
out
of
the
legislative
goal.
now,
what
the
government
says
is
solely
because
the
states
also
at
the
same
time
intend
to
allow
a
carrier
who
is
dissident
or
disagrees
with
the
information
or
the
rate
that
results
from
the
collective
activity
can
come
forward
with
his
own
information
or
his
own
proposal
for
whatever
specific
reasons
as
may
have
and
underlying
these
reasons
are
certainly
those
areas
of
anticompetitive
conduct
that
the
states
don't
intend
to
authorize
or
approve,
such
as
coercion
refusal
to
interline.
these
dangers
which
do
not
enhance
the
public
policy
of
the
state
to
have
uniform
rates
and
to
have
competition
for
service
as
opposed
to
a
cost
plus
competition,
the
state
wants
to
engage
these
individuals
who
are
dissident
into
the
process,
much
as
the
congress
of
the
united
states
said
in
l948.
the
only
way
you
can
obtain
the
exemption
is
to
allow
the
individual
carriers
to
come
forward
and
speak
when
they
disagree
with
the
collective
proposal.
mr.
allen
i.
hirsch
i
don't
believe
it
is,
your
honor.
mr.
allen
i.
hirsch
i
believe
it
is
the
same
right.
the
way
both
of
the
rights
evolved
is
that
all
rates
under
the
conference
system
are
proposed
to
the
conference
rate
committee.
the
committee
then
reviews
the
information
and
makes
the
determination.
if
they
accept
it
on
a
majority
vote,
then
it
is
proposed
as
a
collective
rate.
if
they
reject
it,
or
if
any
member
who
participates
in
the
rate
that
is
involved
or
the
classification
that
is
involved
decides
that
he
doesn't
agree
with
it,
if
he
is
in
the
minority,
then
either
the
original
proposing
party
or
anyone
who
is
in
the
minority
has
the
right
once
the
committee
has
stated
what
it
intends
to
do
and
makes
a
public
announcement
of
that
has
the
right
to
come
to
the
commission
and
say,
we
want
a
different
treatment.
now,
the
commission
has
the
right
and
often
does
entertain
both
the
independent
proposal
and
the
collective
proposal
simultaneously
in
order
to
avail
itself
of
the
information
provided
by
the
collective
carriers
and
the
information
provided
by
the
independent
carrier--
they
go
through
all
the
evidence
presented,
the
cost
data,
and
they
come
out
with
a
rate,
not
always
the
rate
proposed
collectively
or
the
individual
rate.
mr.
allen
i.
hirsch
not
necessarily.
mr.
allen
i.
hirsch
they
can.
yes,
sir.
if
they
find
that
the
independent
has
stated
a
reason
why
in
its
particular
circumstances
it
should
have
a
special
rate--
mr.
allen
i.
hirsch
--that
is
true.
that
is
true.
mr.
allen
i.
hirsch
for
the
independent.
that
is
correct.
but
the
underlying
reasoning
and
the
underlying
purpose
of
this
case
is
that
this
is
specifically
what
the
states
intend.
what
is
going
on,
what
is
happening,
what
is
resulting,
it
is
coming
out
the
other
end
of
the
commission,
this
regulatory
scheme,
with
a
series
of
uniform
rates
accept
that
to...
only
to
the
extent
that
individuals
have
presented
specific
documentation
or
evidence
or
cost
data
to
except
themselves
from
the
general
rate,
this
is
what
the
commissions
and
the
states
have
intended
in
the
regulation
of
motor
carriers.
to
disallow
this
independent
action
renders
the
activity
as
designated
by
the
states
unavailable.
they
can't
regulate
in
the
manner
they
see
fit.
and
this
is
why
we
contend
that
the
parker
doctrine,
when
we
sift
under
the
verbiage
and
the
words
that
have
come
down
in
the
various
cases
as
applied
to
the
specific
fact
situation
in
each
case,
and
the
court
surely
recognizes,
as
the
chief
justice
pointed
out
in
his
concurring
opinion
in
city
of
lafayette,
this
area
is
evolving.
the
antitrust
laws
have
evolved.
the
commerce
clause
has
evolved.
the
state
action
doctrine
must
also
evolve.
and
while
the
term
v.
brown
was
a
recognition
that
if
we
demonstrate,
as
we
submit
we
have,
that
the
state
intends
the
activity
which
is
taking
place
to
take
place,
clearly
articulates
it,
and
definitely
intends
it
to
take
place,
and
then
actively
participates
in
that
activity
as
it
goes
forward,
then
that
is
state
action.
mr.
allen
i.
hirsch
yes,
your
honor,
absolutely.
i
saw,
all
i
address
the
feed
bullwinkle
act
for
is
to
add
one
more
rung
to
the
federalism
ladder,
because
if
federalism
in
total
congressional
silence
still
means
that
congress
does
not
intend
to
displace
the
right
of
the
state
as
sovereign
to
enact
laws
within
its
bounds,
then
surely
when
congress
later
speaks
in
the
same
area
and
does
that
which
the
states
do,
it
is
absurd
to
argue
that
under
a
federalism
doctrine
they
can
prohibit
the
states
from
doing
just
what
they
are
doing,
that
coupled
with
the
fact
that
they
have
already
said,
we
are
going
to
leave
you
alone.
now,
the
government
points
at
this
and
says,
it
was
congressional
intent
to
allow
the
antitrust
laws
to
continue
to
apply
to
states,
and
that
could
be
inferred
from
the
fact
that
they
did
not
give
the
exemption
stated
in
the
reed
bullwinkle
bill
to
the
states.
and
i
again
say,
much
as
the
silence
with
respect
to
the
sherman
act
is
not
to
be
inferred
to
apply
to
the
states
as
sovereign,
neither
is
the
silence
in
congress
in
giving
the
exemption
only
on
the
federal
level
to
be
implied
that
that
exemption
is
unavailable.
what
it
says
to
us
is
that
congress
had
already
reserved
the
right
to
the
state
to
regulate
this
area,
and
we
are
not
going
to
interfere
with
their
rates,
so
therefore
we
are
not
going
to
go
in
and
tell
them
whether
they
are
exempt
or
not.
that
is
within
the
right
of
the
state
as
a
sovereign.
and
the
states
responded
by
enacting
this
legislation.
the
most
recent...
not
the
most
recent
case,
but
the
most
recent
synthesis
of
the
state
action
doctrine,
of
course,
occurred
in
the
mid-cal
case.
this
case
came
up
while
this
case
was
in
the
appellate
courts.
in
mid-cal,
we
find
it
to
be
very
clear
that
this
court,
after
going
through
each
of
the
state
action
cases
which
preceded
it
and
discussing
the
specific
holdings
found
in
very
definite
language
that
the
result
of
all
the
state
action
cases
was
a
two-pronged
test,
clear
articulation
of
an
affirmative
intent
to
displace
competition
coupled
with
active
supervision.
nowhere
in
mid-cal
does
it
say
that
by
the
way
there
will
be
a
separate
test
for
private
regulated
parties
responding
to
the
regulatory
schemes
of
their
states,
and
they
must
be
compelled,
nor
does
it
say
that
there
are
private
or
different
tests
for
anyone
who
comes
before
this
court.
the
only
differentiation
that
has
been
reached
and
made
more
explicit
was
in
hoover
versus
ronwin,
in
which
this
court
said,
when
the
activity
is
in
fact
the
activity
of
the
state
itself,
and
the
state
is
the
very
actor,
that
is
the
end
of
the
inquiry.
we
will
not
attack
the
states.
but
if
the
actor
be
a
non-sovereign,
then
we
apply
the
mid-cal
test,
and
we
submit
that
the
mid-cal
test
has
been
met,
as
judge
hill
said
both
in
his
dissent
in
the
three-judge
court
of
appeals
and
in
his
dissenting
opinion
in
the
en
banc
hearing
in
this
case.
whether
he
agrees
with
the
majority's
feelings
that
the
activity
in
question
may
be
anticompetitive
is
irrelevant.
the
issue
is
what
this
court
has
said,
and
this
court
has
stated
a
two-pronged
standard,
and
the
carriers
in
this
situation,
the
regulatory
schemes
in
this
situation
meet
that
two-pronged
standard
thoroughly.
mr.
allen
i.
hirsch
in
georgia
versus
pennsylvania
railroad,
the
issue
that
came
before
this
court
actually
was
a
question
of
whether
the
state
of
georgia
could
bring
the
case.
it
was
on
a
motion
for
failure
to
state
a
claim,
and
whether
they
had
original
jurisdiction
in
this
court,
whether
they
had
in
fact
stated
a
cause
of
action.
in
reaching
only
that
conclusion,
this
court
stated
in
dicta
that
collective
activity
when
coupled
with
coercion
and
refusals
to
interline,
some
of
the
activities
that
i
have
previously
referred
to
as
the
reason
for
maintaining
independent
action,
that
there
may
be
violations
of
the
antitrust
laws.
nothing
in
that
case--
mr.
allen
i.
hirsch
--no,
not
at
all.
what
was
the
occurring
in
that
case,
the
reason
that
case
came
before
this
court
was
that
by
reason
of
coercion
and
reasons
of
refusing
to
interline
or
exchange
cargoes
with
railroads
in
the
south
and
railroads
in
the
north,
the
south
was
being
charged
a
discriminatory
rate.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
regulatory
schemes
as
they
now
exist
address
some
of
those
very
problems,
the
discrimination
that
was
resulting.
i
believe
georgia
versus
pennsylvania
railroad
emphasizes...
the
underlying
factual
background,
emphasizes
the
need
for
regulation,
both
on
the
inter
and
intrastate
level
in
this
area,
because
it
was
being
abused,
and
there
was
an
entire
section
of
the
country
which
was
being
discriminated
against
in
its
rates
because
of
abuse
of
the
process.
these
abuses
which
occurred
in
the
georgia
v.
pennsylvania
railroad
context
cannot
occur
because
of
the
second
prong
of
mid-cal,
which
is
the
active
state
supervision
of
the
activity
in
question.
it
will
be
argued,
i
am
sure,
that
the
reed
bullwinkle
bill
was
an
attempt
to
eliminate
this
court's
determination
that
collective
ratemaking
was
a
per
se
violation
of
the
antitrust
laws.
what
the
legislative
history
of
that
bill
specifically
says
is
that
it
is
designed
to
remove
the
questions
raised
by
georgia
versus
pennsylvania
railroad,
to
clear
the
air,
not
to
reverse
this
court,
not
to
change
this
court,
but
say
questions
have
been
raised,
and
therefore
under
this
context
if
you
have
an
agreement
approved
by
the
interstate
commerce
commission
and
you
reserve
the
right
to
independent
action,
then
you
are
entitled
to
an
exemption
from
the
antitrust
laws
because
you
are
a
regulated
industry.
the
states
who
had
engaged
in
this
same
type
of
practice
and
regulation
came
forward
and
have
subsequently
issued
their
own
state
regulatory
schemes
which
address
the
same
problems,
and
the
result
is
that
they
have
clearly
articulated
the
intent
to
allow
the
activity
in
question
as
long
as
the
independent
carrier
has
the
right
to
file
independently,
and
they
police
any
abuses
of
this
system
either
in
a
collective
nature
or
in
an
individual
nature
or
in
the
use
of
coercion
by
pervasively
regulating
and
actively
supervising.
the
bottom
line
is,
as
i
believe
justice
powell
said
in
hoover
versus
ronwin,
conspire
as
they
will,
the
carriers
in
this
case
can
do
nothing
without
the
subsequent
review
and
approval
of
the
state
commissions.
they
can
sit
around
and
agree
on
every
price,
every
rate,
everything
they
want
to
agree
on,
and
when
they
walk
away
from
that
room,
they
have
accomplished
nothing
other
than
reaching
an
agreement
to
present
to
the
public
service
commissions
for
hearing,
for
review,
for
requests
for
additional
information,
and
after
that
hearing
and
after
that
review,
the
public
service
commissions
meet
and
they
set
the
rate.
every
one
of
the
state
statutes
is
clear
in
that
instance
that
it
is
not
the
carriers
who
are
setting
the
rates.
it
is
the
public
service
commission.
that,
the
rate
itself,
is
the
act
of
the
state.
i
likewise
submit
for
those
same
reasons
that
were
the
party
before
this
court
today
the
public
service
commissions,
who
are
represented
in
an
intervenor
capacity
by
the
national
association
of
regulatory
utility
commissioners,
this
court
nor
the
lower
courts
could
have
found
them
to
be
in
violation
of
the
antitrust
laws.
so,
this
clearly
emphasizes
the
position
that
if
the
regulatory
commissions
are
not
violating
the
antitrust
laws,
that
merely
because
those
responding
to
the
regulation
and
subjecting
themselves
to
the
regulation
because
they
are
mandated
to
subject
themselves
to
the
regulation
can
be
violating
the
antitrust
laws
is
again
classifying
parker
v.
brown
as
a
case
standing
for
nothing
more,
as
justice
stewart
pointed
out
in
his
dissent
in
cantor,
nothing
more
than
the
proposition
that
porter
brown
sued
the
wrong
party.
mr.
allen
i.
hirsch
i
am
not
relying
on
the
dissenting
position
as
applied
in
cantor,
your
honor.
no,
sir,
i
believe
cantor--
mr.
allen
i.
hirsch
--the
difference
is
that
in
cantor,
the
state
regulatory
system
was
not
only
silent
with
respect
to
the
regulation
of
lightbulbs,
but
lightbulbs
had
absolutely
nothing
to
do
with
the
regulation
of
electric
utilities
in
the
state
of
michigan.
this
case
goes
to
the
very
heart--
mr.
allen
i.
hirsch
--their
approval
of
the
tariff
proved
two
factors
which
would
have
been
their
downfall
ever
under
the
mid-cal
test,
and
one
is,
there
wasn't
a
clear
articulation,
we
submit.
it
wasn't
there
with
regard
to
lightbulbs.
and
secondly,
there
was
no
active
supervision
with
respect
to
lightbulbs.
it
was
merely
a
rubber
stamp.
here
we
have
the
heart
of
the
regulatory
system,
the
rates
themselves,
clearly
articulated
to
be
regulated
and
actively
supervised
to
the
extent
that
the
commission
does
in
fact
make
the
rates.
i
will
reserve
five
minutes
to
respond.
mr.
allen
i.
hirsch
yes,
sir.
mr.
allen
i.
hirsch
to
briefly
address
a
few
of
the
questions
that
were
addressed
by
my
brother
counsel,
first,
to
expand
upon
justice
o'connor's
questioning,
not
only
in
parker
did
the
initiation
of
the
regulatory
program
require
the
activity
of
the
private
party
to
begin
at
the
choice
of
the
private
party,
but
once
the
growers
petitioned
the
board
for
a
pro-raisin
program,
it
then
had
to
be
submitted,
once
adopted,
back
to
the
growers
and
voted
on
with
a
65
percent
vote
in
order
to
be
enacted.
so
the
final
word
remained
with
the
raisin
growers
in
parker.
in
this
situation--
mr.
allen
i.
hirsch
--pardon?
mr.
allen
i.
hirsch
in
that
zone,
once
65
percent
of
them
approved
it,
but--
mr.
allen
i.
hirsch
--it
bound
100
percent,
but
they
did
have--
mr.
allen
i.
hirsch
--that
is
correct,
but
while
binding
all
of
them,
it
allowed
them
to
retain
30
percent
of
their
crop
for
pure
competition,
to
compete
purely
with
30
percent
of
their
crop,
so
therefore
they
had
a
blend
of
competitive
and
noncompetitive
activity,
but
it
is...
i
think
it
is
very
important
that
before
the
program
ever
became
effective
it
was
the
growers
who
eventually
had
to
vote
again,
not
the--
mr.
allen
i.
hirsch
--that
is
correct,
other
than
the
fact--
mr.
allen
i.
hirsch
--i
disagree.
they
ask
them,
they
persuade
them,
they
encourage
them
to
file
joint
rates.
mr.
allen
i.
hirsch
by
their
regulatory
schemes,
by
their
orders.
in
fact,
the
alabama
public
service
commission
in
1942--
mr.
allen
i.
hirsch
--yes.
mr.
allen
i.
hirsch
it
sets
forth
the
procedures
for
doing
so.
mr.
allen
i.
hirsch
well,
that
would
imply
that
they
are
requesting
them
to
file
this
way,
and
each...
what
is
in
the
briefs,
your
honor,
is
each
of
the
states--
mr.
allen
i.
hirsch
--no,
sir.
he
is
not
violating
the
regulation.
mr.
allen
i.
hirsch
that
is
correct,
but
the
states
have
said
that
absent
the
collective
activity,
they
could
not
regulate.
they
could
not
carry
out
their
mandate
from
the
state
if
they
did
not
have
the
collective
activity.
they
could
not
handle
the
individual
rates,
and
they
do
not
desire
to
have
the
individual
rates.
mr.
allen
i.
hirsch
that
is
a
very
close
question,
and
it
may
vary
with
regard
to
each
state.
i
would
say
that
in
general
the
mandate
of
the
state
for
the
regulatory
procedures
came
before
the
collective
activity.
of
course,
the
collective
activity
in
the
railroad
industry
predates
the
motor
carrier
industry,
but
the
motor
carrier
acts
themselves
in
the
states
began
anywhere
from
the
1920's
up
to
the
1940's,
and
it
is
a
very
close
parallel
as
to
on
a
state-by-state
basis
which
one
is
actually
the
first.
i
would
also
say
that
the...
in
response
to
the
cantor
question,
my
brother
stated
that
participation
of
the
state
is
not
enough,
and
i
concur
with
that.
the
fallacy
of
cantor
under
a
mid-cal
approach
is
that
there
is
not
a
clearly
articulated
state
policy
regarding
lightbulbs,
and
in
this
case
there
is
a
clearly
articulated
policy
regarding
rates,
and
it
is
pervasively
and
actively
supervised.
i
also
question
how
active
the
supervision
was
with
respect
to
the
lightbulbs.
the
other
interesting
point
my
brother
makes
is
that
at
the
time
this
case
was
filed,
no
state
had
statutes
regarding
the
specific
activity.
is
this
not
the
clearest
articulation
of
their
intent
to
have
a
combination
of
collective
activity
and
independent
activity
by
the
fact
that
they
came
forward
in
light
of
this
case
and
enacted
state
legislation
dealing
with
this
specific
area,
and
restating,
we
desire
both?
in
conclusion,
i
submit
to
the
court
that
no
one,
not
the
parties
or
the
courts
below,
question
this
clear
articulation
or
legislative
intent.
no
one,
not
the
courts
below
or
the
parties,
question
the
active
supervision.
the
only
question
here
is
whether
it
is
compelled.
thank
you.
