justice
o'connor
mr.
hirsch,
can
you
distinguish
the
rate
bureaus
in
this
case
from
those
the
court
was
considering
in
the
georgia
railroad
company
case?
justice
o'connor
well,
my
question
was
whether
the
rate
bureaus
operate
in
the
same
fashion
here
as
in
that
case.
justice
o'connor
well,
on
this
point,
then,
mr.
wallace,
assuming
that
we
have
active
supervision
by
the
public
utility
commission,
if
the
state
has
clearly
articulated
a
policy
of
desiring
to
have
joint
rate
proposals
as
part
of
the
scheme,
what
more
is
gained
by
saying
it
has
to
be
compelled?
justice
o'connor
well,
if
the
state
is
free
to
say
we
want
all
rates
made
as...
initiated
as
joint
rate
proposals,
why
can't
the
state
say,
we
would
like
to
have
you
do
that
but
we
aren't
going
to
compel
it
in
every
case,
we
will
leave
an
avenue
for
independent
application?
justice
o'connor
well,
didn't
parker
itself
leave
up
to
the
individual
raisin
producers
some
flexibility
in
deciding
whether--
justice
o'connor
okay,
but
here,
doesn't
the
state
leave
it
to
the
truckers
to
decide
whether
to
initiate
initially
this
joint
rate
proposal,
and
then
if
it
is,
the
state
carries
on
from
there
and
fixes
the
rate?
how
do
you
distinguish
that?
justice
o'connor
well,
mr.
wallace,
it
did
seem
to
me
that
in
cantor
it
didn't
make
a
bit
of
difference
to
the
state
whether
the
utility
wanted
to
supply
lightbulbs
or
not.
the
state
absolutely
didn't
care.
there
seems
to
be
an
element
here
of
the
state
wanting
to
encourage
the
utilization
of
these--
