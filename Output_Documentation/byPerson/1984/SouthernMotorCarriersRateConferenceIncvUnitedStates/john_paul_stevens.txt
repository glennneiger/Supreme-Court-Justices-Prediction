mr.
hirsch--
justice
stevens
--hasn't
the
state
said
to
every
single
independent
motor
carrier,
go
do
as
you
will?
justice
stevens
don't
they
all
have
an
independent
right
of
action?
justice
stevens
under
the
state
schemes,
is
the
right
of
independent
action
of
the
independent
carrier
different
from
what
it
is
under
the
federal
scheme,
in
your
view?
justice
stevens
it's
the
same
right?
justice
stevens
can
they
come
out
with
one
rate
for
the
majority
and
a
separate
rate
for
the
independent?
justice
stevens
but
can
they?
justice
stevens
well,
isn't
it
true
that
within
the
zone
of
reasonableness
there
can
be
more
than
one
rate?
justice
stevens
which
might
include
both
one
rate
for
the
majority
and
either
a
higher
or
lower
rate
for
the
independent.
justice
stevens
may
i
ask
just
one
other
question,
mr.
hirsch?
would
it
be
your
view
that
even
if
congress
had
not
passed
the
reed
bullwinkle
act
in
1948
that
your
argument
would
be
equally
strong?
justice
stevens
do
you
rely
on
the
dissenting
position
in
cantor?
your
argument
is
very
close
to
it.
justice
stevens
what
is
the
difference
between
this
case
and
cantor?
justice
stevens
the
commission
thought
it
had
something
to
do
with
it,
because
they
approved
the
tariff,
the
lightbulb--
justice
stevens
mr.
hirsch,
which
came
first,
the
collective
activity
or
the
mandate
from
the
states?
