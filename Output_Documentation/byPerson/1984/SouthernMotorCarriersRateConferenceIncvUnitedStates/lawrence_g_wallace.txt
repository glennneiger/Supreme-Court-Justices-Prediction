mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court...
forgive
my
cold...
one
of
the
concerns
manifested
in
the
legislative
history
of
the
sherman
act
and
that
prompted
the
act's
passage
was
concern
over
price
collusion
in
railroad
rates
that
was
then
prevalent,
and
railroads
were
at
that
time
the
predominant
form
of
freight
transportation
in
the
united
states.
the
very
first
sherman
act
cases
to
reach
this
court
were
two
suits
by
the
united
states
under
section
1
of
the
sherman
act
to
enjoin
railroad
cartel
practices.
these
were
united
states
against
trans-missouri
freight
association,
166
us
in
1897,
and
united
states
against
joint
traffic
association,
171
us
in
1898.
in
both
cases
the
court
ruled
that
the
united
states
was
entitled
to
an
injunction
against
these
practices.
in
the
trans-missouri
case
it
was
a
cartel
created
by
18
railroads
which
provided
service
west
of
the
mississippi,
and
joint
traffic
was
a
similar
cartel
among
lines
serving
between
chicago
and
the
east
coast.
and
they
had
through
the
cartel
promulgated
a
freight
rate
structure
to
which
they
would
all
adhere,
although
they
could
compete
among
themselves
by
means
other
than
rate
competition.
well,
there
are,
of
course,
differences
between
those
cases
and
this
one.
the
present
suit
by
the
government
to
enjoin
price
collusion
in
the
now
dominant
field
of
motor
carrier
freight
transportation
is
in
the
tradition
of
these
earlier
cases,
and
like
the
earlier
cases,
our
suit
reflects
not
just
concern
about
the
familiar
evils
of
price
collusion
among
competitors,
but
the
particular
economic
concern
about
the
ripple
effects
of
price
competition
in
a
service
industry
like
freight
transportation,
ripples
which
can
be
intensified
as
they
are
added
to
at
various
stages
of
the
process
of
manufacturing
and
distributing
goods,
if
the
price
is
increased
of
getting
supplies
to
the
manufacturer,
getting
the
manufactured
goods
to
the
wholesaler,
of
getting
the
goods
from
the
distributor
to
the
retailer,
and
so
forth.
now,
we
saw
a
very
dramatic
example
of
these
ripple
effects
in
a
comparable
situation
during
the
time
of
rapid
price
rises
in
the
cost
of
energy
imposed
by
the
opec
cartel.
here
we
are
dealing
with
a
much
more
limited
economic
effect.
it
is
what
this
court
recognized
in
georgia
against
the
pennsylvania
railroad
company.
it
is
price
collusion
within
the
zone
of
reasonableness
for
regulated
rates,
but
nonetheless
it
is
a
matter
of
considerable
economic
concern,
and
the
justice
department
has
investigations
in
other
geographic
areas,
and
the
federal
trade
commission
has
also
acted
in
this
field
now,
and
three
amicus
briefs
have
been
filed
in
our
support
in
this
court,
two
by
associations
of
shippers
and
one
by
a
group
of
state
attorneys
general.
and
we
are
talking
about
something
of
considerable
economic
effect,
and
the
point
of
my
introducing
the
subject
this
way
is
that
it
is
in
a
context
not
at
the
periphery,
but
at
the
very
heart
of
shermar
act
concerns
that
the
petitioners
here
who
can
claim
no
express
exemption
from
the
antitrust
laws
are
asking
this
court
to
take
a
more
generous
view
of
the
implied
exemption
for
state
action
than
has
heretofore
been
established
in
this
court's
decisions.
and
i
want
to
make
very
clear
that
they
are
not
claiming
and
cannot
claim
an
express
exemption.
reference
has
been
made
to
the
motor
carrier
act
of
1935,
which
was
the
first
federal
law
that
conferred
authority
on
the
interstate
commerce
commission
to
regulate
motor
carrier
rates
at
all.
by
that
time,
under
this
court's
shreveport
decision,
the
jurisdiction
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission
had
been
extended
to
intrastate
railroad
rates
that
could
affect
interstate
commerce,
and
congress
decided
in
1935
to
confine
the
newly
conferred
rate
regulation
authority
on
the
interstate
commerce
commission
to
the
field
of
interstate
rates,
and
to
leave
rate
regulation
over
intrastate
rates
to
state
public
utility
commissions.
there
was
no
mention
for
interstate
or
intrastate
rates
of
any
exemption
from
the
sherman
act.
there
was
no
delegation
to
the
states
comparable
to
the
mccarren-ferguson
act
that
would
have
exempted
expressly
any
practices
from
the
sherman
act,
and
indeed
ten
years
later
this
court
in
the
georgia
case
held
that
the
1935
act
did
not
confer
an
implied
immunity
even
with
respect
to
interstate
rates.
that
was
a
case
heard
on
motion
for
leave
to
file
a
bill
of
complaint,
and
one
of
the
grounds
on
which
that
motion
was
opposed
was
that
the
bill
of
complaint
did
not
state
a
cause
of
action.
because
of
rate
regulation
by
the
interstate
commerce
commission,
there
was
no
cause
of
action
left
under
the
sherman
act,
and
this
court
explicitly
in
a
section
devoted
to
the
cause
of
action
question
rejected
that
claim,
which
gave
rise
to
the
reed
bullwinkle
act,
which
again
had
no
express
provision
with
respect
to
state
rate
regulation.
now,
another
irony
of
the
claim
for
an
exemption
here
is
that
it
comes
just
at
a
time
when
congress
in
the
1980
motor
carrier
act,
which
we
have
described
in
some
detail
on
page
32
of
our
brief
and
in
the
footnote
there
has
eliminated
in
large
part
the
exemptions
for
rate
collusion
in
interstate
rates
that
existed
under
reed
bullwinkle
with
respect
to
interstate
motor
freight
transportation.
with
very
limited
exceptions,
the
interstate
commerce
commission
can
no
longer
confer
exemption
for
price
collusion
with
respect
to
single
line
rates.
much
of
the
discussion
about
the
previous
scheme
that
was
featured
in
the
courts
below
and
in
the
briefs
is
quite
outmoded
since
these
provisions
have
taken
effect
in
july
of
this
year.
and
indeed,
even
though
the
act
reserves
the
ability
of
two
carriers
to
agree
on
a
joint
rate
as
a
joint
venture
between
themselves,
it
even
eliminates
the
exemption
for
collusion
about
joint
rates
between
two
different
groups
of
carriers
offering
the
same
joint
rate
between
two
points
for
the
same
commodity.
so,
there
is
considerable
irony
in
the
plea
that
it
is
necessary
to
take
a
generous
view
of
the
exemption
in
order
to
have
something
commensurate
at
the
state
level
with
what
we
have
with
respect
to
interstate
motor
traffic.
the
motor
carrier
freight
industry
is
a
$150
billion
annual
industry
in
this
country,
and
it
is
a
matter
of
considerable
economic
concern.
this
is
what
our...
i
can't
give
you
a
breakdown
between
interstate
and
intrastate,
but
the
total,
according
to
our
most
recent
studies,
is
that
we
are
dealing
with
a
$150
billion
industry.
now,
with
this
background,
i
would
like
to
turn
to
the
question
of
the
legal
standard
under
parker
that
governs
here.
parker
is
based
on
dual
principles
of
federalism
stated
by
the
court
in
parker
itself
that
the
sherman
act
broadly
prohibits
restraints
of
trade
imposed
by
individuals
and
corporations
but
was
not
intended
to
prohibit
state
action
or
official
action
directed
by
a
state.
now,
in
the
court's
previous
decisions,
there
has
been
much
discussion
of
criteria,
and
we
have
rehearsed
that
in
some
detail
in
our
brief.
the
court
has
stated
that
the
action,
when
we
are
talking
about
action
of
private
individuals,
has
to
be
something
required
by
the
state.
it
has
talked
about
compulsion.
it
has
said
that
the
court
has
rejected
the
idea
that
state
authorization,
approval,
encouragement,
or
participation
or
prompting
of
the
privately
imposed
restraint
won't
suffice.
it
has
rejected
those
criteria.
and
this
has
given
rise,
in
accordance
with
the
tendency
in
this
country
for
an
elaborately
legalistic
federalism
that
sometimes
confuses
people
from
elsewhere,
it
has
given
rise
to
discussion
by
the
commentators
about
possible
refinements
of
the
meaning
of
all
these
terms,
including
compulsion,
which
in
our
view
tend
to
obscure
as
much
as
illuminate
what
is
the
basic
question
in
these
cases,
and
that
is
the
intensely
practical
question
that
the
court
addressed
in
cantor,
namely,
who
is
it
who
exercises
the
choice
under
the
state
scheme,
who
exercises
the
choice
between
competition
and
collusion?
is
that
choice
made
by
private
parties
acting
in
their
own
economic
self-interest,
or
is
that
choice
made
by
the
state
acting
in
the
public
interest
as
part
of
a
regulatory
program
that
it
is
imposing?
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
then
you
would
get
into
the
mid-cal
question
of
whether
there
is
adequate
supervision,
which
is
not
contested.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that's
correct.
that
is
what
seems
to
us
to
be
the
criterion
with
respect
this
so-called
compulsion
aspect.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
there
might
be
another
ground
for
contesting
whether
there
was
immunity,
but
the
compulsion
standard
would
be
satisfied.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
the
question
of
adequate
supervision,
which
was
the
ground
addressed
in
the
mid-cal
case,
because
the
state
can't
just
go
around
compelling
conduct
inconsistent
with
the
sherman
act--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--that
is
with
respect
to
municipalities.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
by
the--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--active
supervision
by
the
commission
of
private
conduct,
whatever
that
would
amount
to.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
not
involved
in
this
case.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
our
view,
our
understanding
of
the
entire
parker
line
of
decisions
is
that
it
is
only
state
action,
not
state
policy
that
is
exempted
from
the
sherman
act.
it
isn't
up
to
the
states
to
decide
that
they
would
rather
have
private
persons
acting
in
their
own
economic
self-interest
make
the
decision
whether
there
will
be
competition
or
collusion
rather
than
have
that
decision
made
by
congress.
congress
has
already
made
that
decision
in
the
exercise
of
its
constitutional
powers,
and
part
of
the
genius
of
our
constitution
is
that
congress
has
the
authority
to
legislate
directly
with
respect
to
individuals.
the
state
isn't
free
to
second
guess
the
congressional
policy
with
respect
to
that.
i
do
think--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--there
is
a
practical
answer
and
there
is
a
theoretical
answer.
the
practical
answer
is
that
the
states
have
hesitated
to
go
that
far
because
there
are
competing
economic
interests
being
asserted
in
these
states
as
they
are
being
asserted
in
this
court,
and
the
states
have
temporized
on
that
question.
it
is
not
essential
to
the
states'
view
of
the
public
interest
that
there
be
collusion
in
freight
rates,
although
they
have
permitted
it
within
the
zone
of
reasonableness
under
these
schemes,
and
it
by
no
means
will
automatically
follow
if
the
court
agrees
with
our
position
in
this
case
that
the
states
will
then
seriatim
in
any
large
numbers
require
rate
collusion
by
intrastate
carriers.
and
if
they
did,
then
congress
would
have
to
consider
whether
it
would
want
to
override
that
state
judgment,
just
as
it
has
overridden
what
it
had
previously
authorized
under
reed
bullwinkle
in
both
the
motor
carrier
act
of
1980
and
with
respect
to
railroads
in
the
harley
staggers
act.
the
other
answer
is
that
i
think
the
same
result
really
is
reached
whether
we
talk
about
it
as
compulsion
or
whether
we
talk
about
it
as
whether
there
is
a
clearly
articulated
state
policy.
it
is
a
alternative
way
of
reaching
the
result.
if
the
only
clearly
articulated
state
policy
is
that
they
would
rather
have
the
decision
whether
there
will
be
competition
or
collusion
made
by
private
persons
operating
in
their
economic
self-interest
rather
than
made
by
congress,
that
is
not
something
that
this
court
has
ever
said
is
protected
by
the
parker
doctrine.
and
it
would
be
quite
inconsistent
with
the
supremacy
of
federal
law
for
the
parker
doctrine
to
be
extended
to
that
point.
now,
of
course,
in
cases
like
city
of
lafayette--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--with
respect
to
whether
the
state
would
initiate
the
program.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
but
once
the
state
did
initiate
the
program,
it
was
a
state-compelled
program,
which
is
precisely
the
ground
on
which
this
court
in
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
cantor,
and
that
portion
of
cantor
distinguished
parker.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
the
same
way
the
court
distinguished
parker
and
cantor.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
i
beg
your...
there
was...
parts
1
and
3
were
court
opinions,
including
the
part
where
it
distinguished
parker,
and
we
distinguish
it
on
the
same
grounds.
the
decision
whether
to
take
collusive
action
was
being
made
by
private
persons,
and
all
they
did
was
ask
the
state
to
approve
or
acquiesce
in
their
private
initiative
by
having
to
get
approval
from
the
public
utility
commission,
exactly
what
cantor
did,
what
the
company
did
in
cantor.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
because
it
is
portrayed
that
way
by
our
opponents,
but
state
law
will
be
fully
satisfied
if
no
joint
rates
are
submitted
by
any
of
these
motor
carrier
rate
bureaus,
so
one
could
argue
about
whether
the
state
wishes
to
encourage
it,
but
this
court
has
said
that
encouragement
of
private
conduct
that
doesn't
meet
sherman
act
norms
is
not
sufficient
to
confer
parker
immunity.
it
still
always
comes
back
to
the
question
of
who
it
is
that
is
making
the
choice
between
competition
and
collusion,
whether
the
choice
is
made
by
the
state
or
whether
it
is
made
by
private
persons
acting
in
their
own
economic
self-interest.
now,
there
has
been
accommodation
in
the
parker
standards
in
cases
such
as
city
of
boulder
and
city
of
lafayette
in
recognition
of
the
need
to
accommodate
the
distribution
of
governmental
powers
between
a
state
and
its
geographic
and
other
subunits,
and
contentions
are
made
that
similar
accommodations
should
be
made
here.
we
disagree
with
this,
and
urge
the
court
to
maintain
the
distinctions
it
has
heretofore
observed.
what
comes
to
mind
in
responding
to
this
argument
is
my
student
days
studying
antitrust
at
columbia
with
milton
handler.
he
was
fond
of
saying
that
this
court's
trenton
potteries
decision
condemned
price
fixing
among
competitors
as
illegal
because
it
was
a
form
of
private
taxation
imposed
by
private
persons
for
private
purposes.
that
is
not
the
kind
of
distribution
of
governmental
powers
that
the
parker
doctrine
should
encourage.
it
is
exactly
the
kind
of
distribution
of
economic
power
through
collusion
that
congress
prohibited
in
the
basic
prohibition
of
the
sherman
act.
and
there
are
sound
reasons
to
observe
an
appropriate
distinction
between
the
cases
that
involve
distribution
of
powers
within
state
governments
and
the
cases
where
the
state
is
in
some
fashion
disagreeing
with
the
congressional
judgment
about
private
economic
conduct.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
correct,
mr.
justice.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
they
have
exactly
the
authority
that
the
commission
in
cantor
had--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--to
approve
or
disapprove
whether
the
tariff
filed
meets
the
standards
of
the
state
provision.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
i
don't
believe
it
was
wholly
private.
there
is
participation
by
the
state
of
exactly
the
kind
of
participation
that
was
involved
in
cantor,
where
this
court
in
the
court's
opinion
in
cantor
said
that
participation
by
the
state
is
not
enough
to
confer
antitrust
immunity.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
it
is
not
a
policy
that
has
uniformly
been
followed,
but
it
is,
so
far
as
we
are
able
to
ascertain,
and
has
been
the
predominant
policy,
although
not
one
that
we
were
by
any
means
fully
aware
of,
because
there
have
been
very
few
state
statutes
dealing
with
rate
bureau
practices.
in
this
case,
none
of
the
states
involved
in
this
case
had
statutes
dealing
with
this
subject
when
the
suit
was
instigated,
although
some
of
them
enacted
statutes
on
the
subject
since
that
time.
i
do
think
there
is
a
considerable
difference
between
questions
such
as
that
in
the
bankamerica
case,
where
the
question
was
whether
activity
violated
a
provision
of
the
antitrust
laws,
and
it
had
been
activity
that
had
gone
unquestioned
for
many
years,
and
the
question
in
this
case,
which
is
about
the
scope
of
an
exemption,
where
we
have
activity
that
is
clearly
price
collusion
within
the
scope
of
a
per
se
violation
of
section
1
of
the
sherman
act.
and
there
is
much
in
the
jurisprudence
to
indicate
that
the
exemption
does
not
extend
that
far,
even
though
there
may
not
have
been
heretofore
as
vigorous
an
enforcement
policy
as
is
now
being
pursued,
but
it
is
being
pursued
only
in
the
form
of
seeking
injunctive
relief
at
this
point.
that
basically
is
our
submission.
unless
there
are
further
questions,
we
are
prepared
to
submit
the
case.
