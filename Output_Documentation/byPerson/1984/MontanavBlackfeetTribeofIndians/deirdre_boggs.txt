ms.
deirdre
boggs
thank
you,
your
honor,
and
if
it
please
the
court:
the
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
the
express
tax
authorization
provision
in
the
1924
indian
mineral
leasing
act
which
would
allow
montana
to
tax
the
blackfeet
tribe's
mineral
royalties
has
been
eradicated.
the
1924
indian
mineral
leasing
act
allowed
the
secretary
of
the
interior
to
enter
into
long-term
leases
for
oil
and
gas
on
unallotted
lands
on
treaty
reservations
with
the
consent
of
the
affected
tribe.
that
act
also
allowed
for
the
taxation
of
all
minerals,
not
just
oil
and
gas,
produced
on
these
same
allotted
lands.
no
regulations
were
ever
drafted
to
implement
the
taxation
provision
of
this
act.
the
state
of
montana
has
taxed
oil
and
gas
production
on
the
blackfeet
indian
reservation
since
1936
when
this
court
held
in
british-american
oil
producing
company
that
the
1924
act
applied
to
the
blackfeet
oil
and
gas
leases.
in
1977
the
solicitor
held
that
the
1938
indian
mineral
leasing
act
replaced
completely
the
1924
indian
mineral
leasing
act,
so
that
the
tax
authorization
that
was
specifically
included
in
the
'24
act
was
limited
to
pre-1938
act
leases.
this
case
was
filed
by
the
blackfeet
tribe
shortly
afterwards.
the
blackfeet
tribe
alleged
and
insisted
that
some
of
the
state's
taxes
fell
under
royalties.
they
alleged
that
the
1938
act
completely
replaced
the
'24
act,
and
that
that
replacement
did
away
with
the
taxing
provisions
in
the
'24
act.
and
they
alleged
that
the
language
in
the
1924
act
which
refers
to
such
lands
that
can
be
taxed
is
limited
to
lands
that
are
leased
in
fact
under
the
1924
act.
in
montana
the
oil
and
gas
producers
file
all
the
tax
returns
with
the
state,
and
they
are
solely
responsible
for
all
tax
payments.
the
producers
are
not
parties
to
this
case,
and
the
tribe
doesn't
challenge
the
taxes
on
the
producers'
share.
the
predecessor
taxes
to
the
montana
taxes
challenged
here
were
challenged
in
1935
within
months
of
a
written
opinion
that
was
issued
by
the
department
of
interior
stating
that
montana's
taxes
could
not
be
imposed
on
the
production
of
oil
and
gas
on
the
blackfeet
reservation.
the
taxes
on
both
the
producers'
share
and
the
royalty
owner's
share
in
that
case
were
specifically
challenged
in
british-north
american
oil
producing
company.
the
only
difference
in
the
operation
of
the
taxes
in
that
case
and
this
case
is
that
the
net
proceeds
tax
in
that
case
had
a
mandatory
pass-on
provision
where
although
the
producers
paid
the
taxes
and
filled
out
the
forms,
there
was
a
mandatory
requirement
that
a
pro
rata
share
of
the
taxes
that
would
fall
on
the
tribal
royalties
would
be
collected
from
the
royalty
owners.
the
taxation
authority
of
the
state
was
upheld
on
all
taxes
in
that
case.
montana
has
collected
all
of
the
taxes
since
the
british-american
decision,
notwithstanding
the
passage
of
the
1938
indian
mineral
leasing
act.
the
purposes
of
the
1938
indian
mineral
leasing
act
were
set
forth
in
the
reports
that
accompanied
that
legislation.
the
purposes
were
to
cure
specific
defects
that
congress
had
observed
in
the
indian
mineral
leasing
statutes.
it
did
not
change
the
taxation
authority
that
was
granted
in
the
'24
act.
none
of
the
contemporary
commentators
of
the...
or
around
the
'38
act
suspected
that
the
taxation
authority
had
been
eliminated
by
the
passage
of
the
'38
act.
felix
cohen
in
his
1942
edition
of
328
talks
about
the
intent
of
the
1938
act.
he
refers
to
the
letter
from
the
department
of
interior
that
we've
included
in
the
petitioners'
appendix
where
the
defects
in
the
indian
mineral
leasing
scheme
are
itemized
in
detail.
and
he
says
that
"a
reading
of
that
letter
throws
considerable
light
on
the
problems
intended
to
be
met
by
the
act.
"
and
again,
the
letter
that's
in
the
report...
this
is
senate
report
985...
goes
into
the
most
specific
details
about
the
defects
that
congress
sought
to
cure.
ms.
deirdre
boggs
we've
referred
to
that...
of
course,
that's
no
longer
professor
cohen.
there
are
three
references
to
the
1977
solicitor's
opinion
acknowledging
that
opinion
and
accepting
it;
that
is,
that
the
'38
act
wiped
out
the
tax
authority.
that
was
not
the
position
in
any
of
the
previous
editions...
either
of
the
two
previous
editions
of
the
book.
ms.
deirdre
boggs
you're
referring
to
the
language
"such
lands"...
"provided
that
such
lands
shall
be
taxed?
"
and
it's
your
position,
then,
that
"such
lands"
refers
to
the
lands
that
are
leased--
ms.
deirdre
boggs
--justice
o'connor,
it
can't.
the
taxation
provision
can't,
i
think,
because
the
taxation
provision
allows
for
taxation
of
oil
and
gas
and
other
minerals
on
the
unallotted
treaty
reservation
lands.
the
leasing
part
of
that
act
only
permits
the
secretary
to
enter
into
long-term
leases
for
oil
and
gas
on
those
lands.
i
think
the
only
grammatical
and
logical
way
to
read
that
taxation
provision
is
that
it
applies
for
all
mineral
productions
on
those
unallotted
treaty
reservation
lands.
i
think
that
if
nothing
else,
the
inclusion
of
other
minerals
in
that
taxation
provision...
that
is,
minerals
other
than
the
ones
that
the
leasing
provision
allowed
for...
would
make
it
so
that
we
have
to
read
the
tax
provision
to
apply
to
more
than
just
lands
leased
under
the
act.
the
administrative
practice,
in
addition
to
the
solicitor's
opinions
up
till
1977,
was
to
allow
montana
to
levy
and
assess
the
taxes
on
the
leases
on
the
blackfeet
reservation.
we
and
the
tribe
both
refer
to
the
variety
of
solicitor's
opinions
and
the
opinions
from
the
department
of
interior
which
reaffirm
the
power
of
the
state
to
exercise
its
tax,
and
in
one
case
in
1954
talk
about
a
procedure
that
would
be
allowed
that
montana
statutes
implement;
that
is,
the
procedure
where
the
producers
themselves
pay
the
taxes,
fill
out
the
tax
forms,
and
then
subtract
the
tax
payments
from
the
royalty
payments
to
the
tribes.
then
in
the
montana
situation,
the
usgs
then
credited
those
tax
payments
to
the
royalty
payments.
in
1978,
shortly
after
the
solicitor
issued
its
opinion,
the
u.s.
geological
survey
issued
a
letter
to
the
producers
in
montana
warning
them
that
no
longer
would
the
tax
payments
that
they
were
making
and
deducting
from
the
tribal
royalties
be
credited
to
their
royalty
payments.
the
en
banc
opinion
of
the
ninth
circuit
held
that
if
you
impose
the
policy
of
congress
in
the
indian
reorganization
act
and
other
acts
on
a
reading
of
these
two
acts
together
that
the
taxation
provision
in
the
1924
act
has
disappeared.
congress
has
not
acted
since
1938
in
relation
to
this
issue.
the
state
urges
in
this
case
that
rather
than
overlay
a
policy
or
a
perceived
policy
of
congress
or
a
changed
policy
of
congress
on
the
interpretation
of
the
taxation
provision
or
whether
it
still
exists,
that
the
court
look
at
the
statutes
using
more
ordinary
analysis
for
statutory
construction.
we
would
urge
that
the
court
look
at
the
section
7
repealer
in
the
1938
act
which
repeals
acts
or
parts
of
acts
inconsistent
with
the
'38
act,
and
read
that
the
way
this
court
has
always
read
that,
which
means
that
those
provisions
of
previous
acts,
especially
specific
ones
specifying
certain
things
that
are
not
inconsistent
with
a
later
act,
remain.
ms.
deirdre
boggs
no,
your
honor.
they
said
it
had
been
replaced.
they
had
it
disappear
without
repeal.
they
didn't
apply
any
of
those
standards
of
construction
to
analyzing
the
statutes.
ms.
deirdre
boggs
i
feel
that
the
part
of
the
1924
act
that
provides
specifically
for
state
taxation
remains;
that
it's
never
been
eliminated
and
that
it
therefore
remains.
i
think
that
an
analysis
of
whether
or
not
there
has
been
a
repeal
has
to
be
made
when
you
have
a
specific
provision
in
an
earlier
statute,
and
there's
a
later
statute
that's
a
general
statute
dealing
with
the
same
subject.
ms.
deirdre
boggs
they...
they--
ms.
deirdre
boggs
--they
did
not
deal
with...
as
i
recall,
the
en
banc
panel
didn't
deal
at
all
with
the
section
7
provision
and
what
it
might
mean.
ms.
deirdre
boggs
it...
yes,
your
honor.
i
believe
that
the
only
reading
of
that
provision
as
far
as
the
meaning
of
"such
lands"
goes
is
that
those
are
lands
that
are
unallotted
lands
on
treaty
reservations;
that
is,
lands
that
are
bought
and
paid
for
by
indian
tribes
on
the
reservations.
ms.
deirdre
boggs
as
described
in
the
act
of
1891.
ms.
deirdre
boggs
yes,
your
honor.
in
british-american
oil
producing
this
court
had
to
struggle
with
what
"such
lands"
meant,
and
one
of
the
challenges
in
that
case
was
whether
or
not
these
were
unallotted
lands,
because
in
fact...
it's
rather
peculiar
situation...
in
fact,
the
surface
lands
that
we're
talking
about
here
were
allotted.
the
minerals
were
reserved.
and
the
position
taken
by
the
producer
in
british-american
oil
was
that
section
10
of
the
1919
mineral
leasing
act
had
to
apply
to
those
lands,
because
you're
not
dealing
really
with
unallotted
lands.
this
court
held
that
the
reserved
mineral
rights
beneath
the
surface
lands
were
on
allotted
lands.
that
was
a
specific...
one
of
the
specific
holdings
of
this
court
in
british-american.
most,
if
not
all,
of
the
surface
lands
in
dispute
here
were
allotted
lands
with
the
minerals
specifically
reserved
under
section
10
of
the
1919
act,
which
this
court
held
did
not
limit
the
application
of
the
'24
act
to
the
leases.
ms.
deirdre
boggs
unallotted.
ms.
deirdre
boggs
i'm
sorry.
ms.
deirdre
boggs
that's
right,
your
honor.
if...
if--
ms.
deirdre
boggs
--it
covers
the
lands
under
which--
ms.
deirdre
boggs
--okay.
not
even
referring
to
that
case,
though,
1891
act.
these
are
lands
bought
and
paid
for.
they're
unallotted
lands
that
are
bought
and
paid
for
on
the
indian
reservation.
in
addition
to
urging
an
analysis
of
these
statutes
under
standard
canons
of
statutory
construction,
and
specifically
referring
to
the
case
of
hess
v.
reynolds
as
it
applies
to
an
interpretation
of
the
repealer
language
that
we
have
here,
it's
our
position
that
even
if
the
court
were
to
overlay
indian
reorganization
act
policies
on
its
interpretation
of
what
the
1938
act
does
and
doesn't
do
in
relation
to
these
taxes
that
the
conclusion
does
not
have
to
be
that
these
taxes
were
wiped
out.
the
ira
policies
that
the
ninth
circuit
looked
at
were
the
policies
to
undo
the
allottment
act
policies.
they
were
concerned
there
with
the
land
losses
that
had
taken
place
under
those
policies,
and
that
was
what
they
wanted
to
reverse.
and
in
doing
that,
they
made
a
specific
provision
exempting
from
taxation
lands
that
were
purchased
under
the
ira.
that
is
the
only
tax
exemption
provision
in
the
indian
reorganization
act.
and
this
court
has
held
in
the
kescalero
v.
jones
case
that
even
when
you're
dealing
with
the
specific
lands
referred
to
that
were
to
be
tax
exempt
that
that
reference
doesn't
mean
that
any
income
received
from
those
lands
are
to
be
tax-exempt.
there's
absolutely
no
mention
in
any
of
the
materials
relating
to
the
indian
reorganization
act
in
any
of
the
reports
or
voluminous
hearings
related
to
that
act
where
congress
gave
any
suggestion
at
all
that
they
wanted
to
undo
the
previously
authorized
tax
provisions
in
any
of
these
mineral
leasing
acts.
the
result
and
the
conclusion
that
the
ninth
circuit
reached
here,
the
way
they
reached
it
i
think
is
quite
extraordinary;
that
is,
they
read
the
various
congressional
policies
as
they
say
them
to
eradicate
something
that
congress
had
never
eradicated.
in
hess
v.
reynolds
this
court
said
that
when
there's
a
repealer
such
as
the
one
in
the
1938
act
that
repeals
acts
or
parts
of
acts
inconsistent
with
the
act,
that
that
in
itself
means
that
there
remains...
there
remains
the
specific
provisions
in
previous
acts
so
long
as
they're
not
contrary
to
the
later
general
act.
and
it's
that
sort
of
analysis
that
i
think
this
issue
presents
to
the
court.
i
think
that
if
that
sort
of
analysis
is
given
to
these
statutes,
even
if
the
court
were
to
look
at
the
indian
reorganization
policy,
that
the
tax
provision
that
was
written
specifically
in
the
1924
act
would
be
found
to
stand.
ms.
deirdre
boggs
thank
you,
your
honor.
your
honor,
we
would
agree
with
mr.
kneedler
that
the
1942
edition
of
cohen
should
be
looked
at
here.
and
mr.
kneedler
cites
us
to
cohen
for
the
proposition
that
the
'38
act
superseded
the
'24
act
and
that
that
supersession
does
away
with
the
tax
authority.
mr.
cohen
on
another
page
that
none
of
us
have
cited
in
our
briefs,
page
257,
talks
about--
ms.
deirdre
boggs
--of
his
1942
edition
of
"federal
indian
law"...
excuse
me...
talks
about
the
authority
of
states
to
tax.
this
was
after
1938
that
he
put
out
this
edition.
and
there
in
that
section
he
refers
to
the
1924
act
as
the
example
of
states'
authority
to
tax
as
granted
by
congress.
it's
clear
that
in
the
earlier
page
that
mr.
kneedler
refers
to
that
felix
cohen
is
referring
to
the
leasing
provisions,
not
the
taxation
provision,
in
the
1924
act.
the
tribe
insists
that
this
is
a
case
involving
statutory
construction,
and
it
is.
and
the
tribe
went
through
the
fact
that
the
'38
act
incorporates
and
carries
forward
all
parts
of
the
'24
act
except
the
taxation
authority.
the
reason
for
this
is
that
congress
had
very
specific
defects
in
mind
with
the
indian
mineral
leasing
that
it
set
forth
to
cure;
and
it
has
told
us
what
those
defects
are.
one
is
that
on
some
reservations
no
leasing
was
permitted.
a
major
defect
is
that
in
many
cases
where
leasing
was
permitted...
for
example,
in
the
1919
act...
the
tribe
had
absolutely
nothing
to
say
about
whether
or
not
there
would
be
leases.
they
didn't
have
a
thing
to
say
about
it.
another
defect
was
that
in
many
cases
there
could
not
be
long-term
leases,
which,
of
course,
prohibited
production.
and,
in
general,
the
defects
inherent
in
the
1919
act
for
metals
where
the
public
land
laws
applied
to
minerals...
mineral
leasing
on
indian
reservations
were
seen
as
things
that
needed
to
be
cured.
they
do
not
see
taxation
as
a
problem
that
needs
to
be
cured.
the
replacement
theory
i
think
doesn't
work,
can't
work
in
this
case
where
you
have
a
repealer
that
repeals
only
things
inconsistent
with
the
act
stated,
especially
when
we
have
congress
telling
us
what
they're
doing
with
the
'38
act.
and
what
they're
doing
is
taking
care
of
specific
defects
which
do
not
include
taxation.
i'd
just
like
to
quickly
say
one
other
thing.
i
wasn't
clear
on
whether
mr.
kneedler
indicated
whether
or
not
the
u.s.
knew
or
didn't
know
about
the
taxation
in
the
state
of
montana.
part
of
the
evidence
submitted
to
the
district
court
by
the
tribe
included
sheets
where
the
u.s.
geological
survey
specifically
credited
to
the
tribal
royalty
the
amount
of
taxes
paid
by
the
producers.
there
are
sheets
and
sheets
of
this
where
the
united
states
has
given
credit
to
the
producers
on
the
royalty
payments.
and
the
other
thing
that
again
was
in
the
district
court
record...
it's
not
part
of
the
printed
record
here;
it's
attached
to
briefs
in
the
district
court...
is
a
letter,
1978,
from
the
geological
survey,
again
to
the
producers,
indicating
that
this
past
policy
of
crediting
to
the
royalty
payments
the
taxes
or
some
of
the
taxes
that
they
paid
will
no
longer
happen,
indicating
again
that
the
practice
had
been
to
do
that
pretty
consistently.
thank
you.
