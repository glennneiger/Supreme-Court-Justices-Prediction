justice
stevens
ms.
boggs,
i
may
have
misunderstood
you,
but
i
want
to
be
sure
what
you
just...
did
you...
i
think
you
used
the
word
"allotted"
when
you
meant
"unallotted".
justice
stevens
the
lands
on
which
the
'38
leases
are
located
are
lands
which
could
have
been
leased
in
1892
pursuant
to
the
1891
act,
is
that...
is
that
true?
justice
stevens
the
surface
land
on
which
the
leases
in
dispute,
the
1938
leases,
are
located
are
lands
which
could
have
given
rise
to
leases
pursuant
to
the
1891
act.
justice
stevens
so
you
say
"such
lands",
which
is
read
literally
under
that
provision,
govern
these
leases,
covers
these
leases,
covers
the
lands
on
which
these
leases
are
located.
justice
stevens
i
understand
the
problem
about
british-american,
but
forgetting
that
for
the
moment.
justice
stevens
may
i
follow
up
with
one
question?
again
focusing
on
the
language,
'24
act...
"subject
to
lease
under
the
1891
act.
"
apart
from
the
fact
that
the
leases
may
not
have
been
granted,
would
you
agree
that
the
lands
on
which
the
1938
and
thereafter
leases
are
located
would
have
given...
could
have
given
rise
to
leases
under
the
1891
act
if
they
had
been...
people
had
acted
promptly
in
1892
or
'93
as
a
matter
of
geography?
justice
stevens
well,
the...
the
leases
subject
to
the
1938
act
which
are
in
dispute
here
are
on
unallotted
lands.
justice
stevens
that
everybody
agrees
on.
is
it
also
true
that
they
are
located
on
such
lands...
that
is,
unallotted
lands...
that
could
have
been
leased
in
1892?
justice
stevens
or
in
1925.
but
in
fact
they
were
not.
justice
stevens
although
they
had
at
one
time
been
subject
to
lease
under
the
1891
act.
justice
stevens
on
that
last
point,
if
everybody
in
1939
had
understood
what
the
solicitor
in
1977
understood
the
statute
to
mean,
would
that
not
have
required
a
holding
that
even
the...
there
could
be
no
tax,
even
on
the
non-indian
interest
in
the
lease,
because
it
would
have
affected
the
bargaining
between
the
parties?
justice
stevens
well,
wouldn't...
i
mean
if
the
oil
companies
knew
they
had
to
bear
the
whole
burden
of
the
tax,
wouldn't
they
have
adjusted
the
indians'
royalty
rate
accordingly?
justice
stevens
may
i
interrupt,
because
you
made
this
argument
before.
i
don't
understand
the
uniformity
argument,
because
under
your
view,
the
'24
leases
are
taxable
and
the
'38
leases
are
not.
that's
not
uniform.
justice
stevens
but
it
seems
to
me
your
uniformity
argument,
it
seems
to
me,
would
support
like
treatment
for
all
the
leases,
and
that's
the
opposite
of
what
you're
contending.
justice
stevens
mr.
kneedler,
may
i
just
ask
another
question
about
the
kwapaw?
it
says
"except
as
said
immunity
is
expressly
waived.
"
it
doesn't
say
in
the
particular
act,
just
as
expressly
waived.
do
you
not
agree
that
there
was
an
express
waiver
in
the
1924
act?
justice
stevens
and...
and
what
repealed
that?
justice
stevens
but
there
was
at
one
time
an
express
waiver
covering
the
lands
at
issue
in
this
case.
justice
stevens
then
does
that
mean
it
repealed
those
even
not
inconsistent
with
the
new
law?
justice
stevens
i
mean
there
was
an
express
waiver
on
the
books.
was
it
repealed
or
was
it
not
repealed?
justice
stevens
so
it
isn't
limited
in
that
language,
if
it's
still
on
the
books
and
still
effective
then.
justice
stevens
well,
they
really
weren't
subject
to
leasing
under
the
1891
act
after
1924
either,
because
they
were
then
subject
to
leasing
under
the
1924
act.
justice
stevens
--isn't
it
also
true
that
the
secretary
of
the
interior
approved
all
these
leases?
justice
stevens
they
didn't
know
how
the
money...
they
didn't
know
how
the
tax
burden
was
going
to
be--
