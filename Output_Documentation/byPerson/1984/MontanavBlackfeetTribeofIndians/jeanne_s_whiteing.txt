ms.
jeanne
s.
whiteing
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
turns
on
a
question
of
statutory
construction:
the
meaning
of
the
1938
mineral
leasing
act.
it
is
our
position
that
the
'38
act
is
a
prospective
replacement
for
prior
leasing
laws,
and
that
it
is
a
comprehensive
statute
which
governs
all
terms
and
conditions
for
the
leasing
of
tribal
lands
for
mineral
purposes.
references
to
other
statutes
are
therefore
unnecessary
and
are
neither...
and
are
not
required.
nothing
in
the--
ms.
jeanne
s.
whiteing
--i
think...
yes,
we
are
saying
that.
and
in
fact,
the
sections
1
and
2
of
the
1938
act
essentially
track
the
language
in
the
1924
act.
in
effect,
they
incorporate
and
carry
forward
that
language;
but
significantly,
they
do
not...
or
sections
1
and
2
do
not,
and
nothing
else
in
the
1938
act
carries
forward
or
incorporates
the
tax.
ms.
jeanne
s.
whiteing
after
1938.
ms.
jeanne
s.
whiteing
we
do
recognize
that
that
act
continues
to
exist
to
govern
leases
which
were
made
before
the
1938
act...
before
the
1938
act,
and
that
is
our
position
in
this
case
here.
ms.
jeanne
s.
whiteing
our
position--
ms.
jeanne
s.
whiteing
--it
does
say
that
it
repeals--
ms.
jeanne
s.
whiteing
--i've
said
that
it...
i
didn't
say
that
it
repealed
the
'24
act.
i
said
it--
ms.
jeanne
s.
whiteing
--replaced
it
for
future
leasing
purposes.
and
even
under
the--
ms.
jeanne
s.
whiteing
--that's
correct.
ms.
jeanne
s.
whiteing
that's...
that
is
our
position.
ms.
jeanne
s.
whiteing
that's...
that
is
our
position
here.
ms.
jeanne
s.
whiteing
no.
we
don't
contend
that
it
repealed
it.
ms.
jeanne
s.
whiteing
it
is
still
on
the
books.
it
was
not
wiped
off
the
books
by
the
1938
act.
ms.
jeanne
s.
whiteing
'38
act
leases
you
mean,
your
honor.
ms.
jeanne
s.
whiteing
i
don't
think
so.
ms.
jeanne
s.
whiteing
we
are
saying
that
they
are
unallotted
lands,
but
they
are
not
subject
to
lease
under
the
1891
act,
and
that
is
the
full--
ms.
jeanne
s.
whiteing
--the
1938
act
does
not
say
anything--
ms.
jeanne
s.
whiteing
--it
is
silent
on
the
issue
of
taxation.
it
does
say
unallotted
lands
on
indian
reservations
are
subject
to
lease
for
mining
purposes
under
the
'38
act.
ms.
jeanne
s.
whiteing
it
says
leases
on
unallotted
lands
or
unallotted
lands
subject
to
lease
under
the
1891
act.
and
our
position
is
that
after
1938--
ms.
jeanne
s.
whiteing
--the
first
part
of
the
1924
act,
your
honor,
says
"unallotted
land
on
indian
reservations,
with
some
exceptions,
subject
to
lease
for
mining
purposes
for
a
period
of
ten
years
under
the
proviso
to
section
3
of
the
act
of
february
28,
1891.
"
ms.
jeanne
s.
whiteing
only
to
lands
leased
under
the
1891
act.
and
after
1938
our
position
is
that
unallotted
lands
are
not
subject
to
lease
under
the
1891
act
because
the
1938
act
completely
replaced
prior
leasing
laws
for
prospective
leases.
ms.
jeanne
s.
whiteing
they...
they
held
that
the
leases
that
were
executed
prior
to
1938
under
the
1891
act
were
taxable.
ms.
jeanne
s.
whiteing
we
don't
dispute
that
here.
ms.
jeanne
s.
whiteing
we
did
certainly
argue
differently
before
the
ninth
circuit.
they
did
not
agree
with
us.
ms.
jeanne
s.
whiteing
i'm
not
sure
i
understand
your
question.
ms.
jeanne
s.
whiteing
that's
correct.
ms.
jeanne
s.
whiteing
they
could
have
been
leased
in
1892
under
the
act
of
1891,
that's
correct.
ms.
jeanne
s.
whiteing
or
in
1925.
but
after
1938
we're
saying
that
they
are
not
subject
to
lease
under
the
1891
act.
ms.
jeanne
s.
whiteing
that's
correct.
now,
montana
makes
the
point
that
the
oil...
the
taxing
consent
in
the
1924
act
cannot
just
apply
to
1891
act
leases
because
it
authorizes
taxation
of
not
just
oil
and
gas
but
other
minerals
as
well.
but
the
1891
act
as
a
whole
certainly
authorized
leases
for
mining
purposes
and
not
just
oil
and
gas
mining.
and
after
all,
the
1924
act
is
an
amendment
to
the
1891
act,
so
the
tax
consent
is
consistent
with
those
lands
that
were
subject
or
those
purposes
for
which
the
1891
act
was
a
leasing
authorization.
basically,
it
is
our
position
that
the
terms
of
the
1924
act
in
themselves
make
clear
that
the
tax
consent
applies
only
to
lands
leased
under
the
1891
act,
and
that
these
lands
at
issue
here
or
the
leases
at
issue
were
not
subject
to
lease
under
the
1891
act
after
1938.
ms.
jeanne
s.
whiteing
well,
of
course
the
ninth
circuit
did
not
address
that
question,
and
it's
not
in
issue
here.
states
still
can
argue
and
do
argue
that
they
can
tax
producers'
interests
and
the--
ms.
jeanne
s.
whiteing
--well,
the
implication,
i
think,
is
that
certainly
there
would
be
no
specific
statute
to
which
a
state
could
point
that
authorizes
such
taxation,
but
they
still
could
argue
that
nevertheless
taxation
would
be
possible,
and
whether
that
taxation
would
be
upheld
depends
on
application
of
the
principles
and
tasks
set
out
in
cases...
in
opinions
of
this
court
such
as
white
mountain
apache
v.--
ms.
jeanne
s.
whiteing
--well,
if
those...
if
those
tests
were
applied,
i
think
that
it
certainly
is
possible
to
find
that
state
taxation
of
producers
is
invalid.
after
all,
this
is
a
tax
on
an
important
resource
of
the
tribe
that's
tied
to
the
land
and
is
intimately
related
to
their
ability
to
become
self-sufficient.
and
under
the
test
in
white
mountain
apache,
even
things
like
gasoline
taxes
and
other
more
minor
taxes
were
found
not
to
be
applicable.
so
i
think
it's
very
possible
for
a
court
to
find
that
these
taxes
are
not
applicable
either
under
that
test.
ms.
jeanne
s.
whiteing
no,
we
have
not.
that
is
not
an
issue
in
our
case.
ms.
jeanne
s.
whiteing
it's
possible
that
that
would
be
an
issue
in
a
future--
ms.
jeanne
s.
whiteing
--there
is
an
issue
yet
to
be
resolved,
and
that
is
the
case
of
tax
incidence;
whether
the
burden
of
the...
whether
the
incidence
of
the
tax
is
actually
on
the
tribe
or
on
the
producer.
ms.
jeanne
s.
whiteing
that's
correct.
so
our
argument
that
the
1938
act
is
a
prospective
replacement
for
prior
leasing
laws
rests
on
several
premises:
first,
the
wording
of
the
statute,
which
we've
talked
about;
second,
its
legislative
history
and
purposes;
historic
indian
policies
and
administrative
treatment
in
practice.
one
other
point
about
the
wording
of
this
1938
act
is
that
sections
1
and
2
do
essentially
incorporate
and
refer
to
the
words
of
the
1924
act.
congress
was
obviously
looking
at
that
act
when
it
enacted
the
1938
act,
and
it
chose
to
incorporate
the
most
important
provisions
of
that
act
governing
leasing,
but
significantly,
it
did
not
carry
forward
and
incorporate
the
tax
provision
of
the
'24
act.
montana
insists
that
the
tax
consent
is
ambulatory
and
that
it
attaches
to
other
provisions,
but...
unless
it
is
specifically
repealed.
but
our
argument
does
not
raise
any
specific
issue
of
repeal,
although
we
do
recognize
that
the
'24
act
may
still
continue
to
exist
to
govern
prior
leases.
the
second
premise
of
our
argument
is
that
the
legislative
history
and
purposes
make
clear
that
the
'38
act
is
a
replacement
statute.
the
legislative
history
is
clear
that
prior
laws
were
considered
inadequate;
that
the
'38
act
was
proposed
as
a
more
satisfactory
law
for
leasing
of
indian
lands
for
mining
purposes;
and
it
was
proposed
as
an
act
to
regulate
mining
on
indian
land
and
not
to
amend
prior
laws.
there
were
three
major
purposes
of
the
1938
act:
to
bring
uniformity
to
the
area
of
indian
law
or
indian
mining;
to
bring
mining
leases
into
harmony
with
the
indian
reorganization
act;
and
to
ensure
that
the
indians
received
the
greatest
economic
return
from
their
land.
each
of
these
purposes
would
be
thwarted--
ms.
jeanne
s.
whiteing
--i
think
it's
a
question
of
when
tax...
how
much
the
tax
may
impact,
and
it
may
be
that
under
that
policy
some
tax...
some
taxation
would
be
possible
but
not--
ms.
jeanne
s.
whiteing
--i
think
that's
right,
and
actually
that
is
our
point
in
referring
to
the
policy
of
both
the
ira
and
the
'38
act,
to
ensure
that
the
tribes
were
economically
revitalized.
but
the
1934
policy,
ira
policy,
and
the
1938
act
obviously
were
not
in
effect
in
1891
or
1924.
they
represent
a
significant
change
in
indian
policy,
and
the
1938
act
was
specifically
than
to
comport
with
that
significant
change
in
policy.
ms.
jeanne
s.
whiteing
well,
i...
i
don't
want
to
indicate
that
the
ira
had
so
much
force
in
the
overall
scheme
of
things.
it's
one--
ms.
jeanne
s.
whiteing
--i'm
saying
that
it
is
one
indication
that
congress
was
looking
to--
ms.
jeanne
s.
whiteing
--i
think
that
it...
i
think
that
it
would
have.
ms.
jeanne
s.
whiteing
no,
i'm
not
changing
my
mind.
i'm
just
saying
that
it's
only
one
indication
that--
ms.
jeanne
s.
whiteing
--well,
a
specific
policy
of
the
ira
was
state
tax
exemption.
ms.
jeanne
s.
whiteing
not
in
itself.
ms.
jeanne
s.
whiteing
i
don't
think
it
would
have
affected
it
specifically.
it
would
certainly
be--
ms.
jeanne
s.
whiteing
--something
to
look
to.
ms.
jeanne
s.
whiteing
it
was
a...
in
terms
of
trying
to
interpret
a
particular
act
that
may
have
purported
to
authorize
taxation,
it
is
a
policy
which
could
be
looked
to
to
determine
what
the
meaning
of
that
act
is;
and
that
is
essentially
the
way
we're
looking
at
it
here.
ms.
jeanne
s.
whiteing
i
don't
think
the
ira
in
itself
changes
any
tax
authority
that
may
have
existed
in
any--
ms.
jeanne
s.
whiteing
--i
did...
i
didn't
mean
to
indicate
that.
i
only
meant
that
it
is
certainly
a
policy
to
look
to
to
determine
whether
taxation
is
authorized
in
any
particular--
ms.
jeanne
s.
whiteing
--i
think
that--
ms.
jeanne
s.
whiteing
--well,
neither
is
there
support
for
the
opposite--
ms.
jeanne
s.
whiteing
--side
of
that
question.
ms.
jeanne
s.
whiteing
that
point
is
precisely...
the
fact
that
there
is
silence
of
the
act
i
think
cuts
in
favor
of
the
tribe.
ms.
jeanne
s.
whiteing
well,
i
think
it
depends
on
the
construction
of
the
1938
act
as
a
replacement
act,
if
that
in
fact
is
the
act
that
authorizes
leasing
on
indian
land.
ms.
jeanne
s.
whiteing
well,
i
think
section
7
of
the
'38
act
in
itself
is
an
express
repeal.
after
all,
it
does
say
that
all
acts
or
parts
of
acts
inconsistent
are
repealed.
ms.
jeanne
s.
whiteing
there
are
a
number
of
inconsistencies.
first
of
all,
the
uniformity
of
purpose
of
the
'38
act
would
be
thwarted
by
application
of
the
'24
act.
some
lands
would
be...
would
be
taxed
but
not
others
which
are
leased
under
the
1938
act.
ms.
jeanne
s.
whiteing
we
admit
that
there
is
some
lack
of
uniformity
to
that
particular--
ms.
jeanne
s.
whiteing
--well,
it
does
support
like
treatment,
and
this
is
our
point
for
'38...
from
1938
forward.
we
do
recognize
that
there
is
some
lack
of
uniformity
because
post-'38
leases
and
pre-'38
leases
would
be
treated
differently;
but
that
uniformity
i
think
is...
or
lack
of
uniformity
is
less...
is
more
acceptable
than
the
lack
of
uniformity
found
otherwise.
