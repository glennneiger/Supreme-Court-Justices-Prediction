justice
white
well,
doesn't
the
act
say
on
its
face
that
this
repeals
acts
that
are
inconsistent
with
the
'38
act?
justice
white
well,
doesn't
it?
isn't
that
what
it
says?
justice
white
and
yet
you
say
it
repeals
every
act
whether
it's
inconsistent
with
it
or
not?
justice
white
it
replaced
it.
justice
white
well,
may
i
see
if
i
fully
understand
it.
what
you're
saying,
i
gather,
is
the
1924
act
to
the
extent
necessary
still
applies
to
leases
before
1938;
is
that
it?
justice
white
well,
ms.
whiteing,
i
would
think
that
if
you
put
that
much
in
the
'34
act,
i
would
think
state
taxation
any
time
after
1934
would
have
been
bad,
and
if
you
say
the
'34
act
has
that
much
force,
that
it
would
have
implicitly
repealed
any
consent
to
taxation
before
that.
justice
white
well,
if
it
didn't
by
itself...
if
it
wouldn't
have
prevented
taxes
in
1935,
i
don't
know
why
if
would
have
in
1938.
justice
white
well,
not
much
of
a
one
if
it
wouldn't
have
affected
the
state's
tax
power
in
1935.
justice
white
so
you
change
your
mind.
justice
white
well,
if
the
'24
act
didn't
to
the
trick
and
you
must
rely
on
the
'38
act,
and
up
until
'38
there
was
an
express
policy
of
permitting
state
taxation,
i
would
think
that
there
would
have...
you
would
expect
to
find
some
mention
of
that
in
the
legislative
history
if
congress
intended
to
dispense
with
taxation.
justice
white
i
mean
even
if
you're
right
on
how
the
act
should
be
construed,
i
would
think
there'd
be
some
support
for
that
construction
in
the
legislative
history;
but
i
don't
see
that
you
cite
any
to
that
effect.
justice
white
well,
i
know.
justice
white
i
agree
with...
i
agree
with
that.
but
i
would
expect
to
find
something
about
it.
justice
white
well,
it
doesn't...
it
doesn't
unless
you
win
on
how
you
construe
the
1924
act.
justice
white
suppose
we
don't
agree
with
you
on
your
replacement
theory
and
that
all
the
'38
act
is
repeal
any
prior
act
that's
inconsistent
with
it.
suppose
that.
then
there
will
have
to
be
some...
something
pretty
express
to
repeal
the
'24
permission,
wouldn't
it?
justice
white
well,
what
would
be
inconsistent
with
the
'38
act?
justice
white
well,
i
gather
what
you're
saying,
mr.
kneedler,
is
that
if
we
want
to
know
what
congress
thought
about
the
policy,
it
was
that
the
indians,
while
restricted,
the
income
therefrom
was
free
from
state
taxation,
except
as
said
immunity
is
expressly
waived.
justice
white
well,
you
sound
as
though
it
were
awfully
clear,
and
it
took
about
50
years
to
discover
it,
i
gather.
justice
white
or
40,
40
years
to
discover
it,
because
didn't...
weren't
states
permitted
to
tax,
and
didn't
they
tax
for
40
years
after
'38?
justice
white
did
they
or
didn't
they?
justice
white
well,
don't
you
know
the
fact?
justice
white
well,
do
you
know
that
the
department
of
interior
thought
that
the
states
were
allowed
to
do
that
for
40
years?
justice
white
did
they
or
didn't
they?
justice
white
well,
reading
the
1977
opinion,
i...
i
would...
that
certainly
acknowledged
that
the
interior
department
had
a
different
view
before
that.
justice
white
well,
continuously
since
1938.
justice
white
well,
he's
not
a...
he's
not
charged
with
the
administration
of
the
statute,
is
he?
justice
white
well,
i
suppose
if
we...
i
suppose
we
could
take
judicial
notice
as
to
whether...
whether
states
were
collecting
taxes
like
this
in
the
interim.
i
don't
suppose
it'd
be
very
hard
to
find
out--
justice
white
--do
you
know
what
the
fact
is
or
not?
justice
white
well,
only
two.
well,
what
about...
what
about
the
two?
were
they
collecting
all
these
years
or
not?
justice
white
well,
that's
all
i
asked
you
really.
justice
white
isn't
it
also--
--so
you
do
know
that
there
are
two
states--
