mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
state
concedes
in
this
case
that
there's
nothing
in
the
language
or
the
legislative
history
of
the
1938
act
to
authorize
state
taxation
of
leases
issued
under
the
act,
and
that,
in
our
view,
is
a
sufficient
answer
to
the
state's
claim
in
this
case;
because
it
is
well
established
that
in
the
absence
of
an
express
authorization,
states
have
no
authority
to
tax
on
indian
reservations.
there
are
a
number
of
reasons
why
that
principle
is
particularly
forceful
here.
first
of
all,
in
1937,
just
a
year
earlier,
the
same
congress
that
passed
the
1938
act
revised
the
special
kwapaw
taxing
act
that
we
discuss
at
page
19
of
our
brief
in
which
congress,
in
response
to
this
very
concern
that
states
might
be
viewed
to
have
power
to
tax
absent
some
express
authorization
in
the
statute,
put
in
statutory
form
the
rule
that
it
understood
to
be
applied
in
such
cases;
and
that
is
that
indian
resources
are
held
without
being
subject
to
state
taxation
in
the
absence
of
a
waiver.
and
the
kwapaw
tax
statute
is
significant
for
another
reason:
because
that
tax,
even
though
it
applied
in
the
special
circumstances
of
oklahoma
that
we
describe
at
some
length
in
our
brief,
induced
congress
to
authorize
taxes.
congress
nevertheless
narrowed
that
particular
tax
to
limit
the
type
of
tax,
to
limit
the
amount
of
the
tax,
to
limit
the
minerals
that
it
applied
to.
and
in
our
view
it
seems
quite
unlikely
that
congress,
having
done
that
for
indians
that
congress
had
believed
were
appropriately
subject
to
state
taxation,
would
have
intended
to
preserve
by
mere
inference
the
much
broader
and
open-ended
tax
authority
that
had
been
enacted
in
1924.
and
this
is
especially
so
since
the
'24
act
was
specifically
patterned
after
the
kwapaw
taxing
statute
in
oklahoma.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
i
do
not,
justice
rehnquist.
what
i
am
suggesting
is
that
the...
is
the
tool
of
construction
for
construing
the
1938
act.
i'm
not
suggesting
that
the
indian
reorganization
act
or
this
kwapaw
statute
of
their
own
force
narrowed
the
prior
taxing
authority,
but
for
example,
when
congress
enacted
the
1938
act,
it
expressly
did
that
to
bring
the
'38
leasing
schemes
into
harmony
with
the
policies
of
the
indian
reorganization
act.
it's
that
fact
that
makes
the
indian
reorganization
act
relevant,
because
congress
decided
that
the
leasing
program
should
be
coordinated
with
the
ira,
and
for
that
reason
it
is
appropriate--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
the
kwapaw...
the
kwapaw
tax
act,
which
was
passed
in
1921,
was
the
model
for
the
1924
act.
congress
when
it
enacted,
the
floor
statement
says,
frankly,
the
only
legislative
history
explaining
the
origins
of
the
tax
provision
says
it
was
patterned
after
the
kwapaw
and
osage
taxes
in
oklahoma.
but
in
fact,
as
we
explain
in
our
brief,
the
circumstances
in
oklahoma
were
far
different.
the
reservations
had
been
abolished.
the
tribal
governments
had
been
abolished.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
i
did,
but
the
1921
kwapaw
statute
was
amended
in
1937
to
narrow
its
scope,
even
in
oklahoma
where--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--it
did,
but
it--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--they
were,
but...
but
it...
but
congress
put
in
statutory
form
in
the
act
itself,
in
the
kwapaw
statute,
the
rule
it
understood,
that
absent
an
express
authorization
of
the
taxing
statute--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--that's
correct.
that's
on
page
19.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
precisely.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
there
was...
but
the
rule
that's
stated
in
the
kwapaw
statute
is
that
there
has
to
be
an
express
waiver
in
the
act
that
it
was
passing,
and
that
since
the
1938
act
does
not
contain
any
reference
to
state
taxes--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--no,
but
it...
but
it...
but
it
does
indicate
congress'
view
of
the...
of
the...
of
the
rule
with
respect
to
state
taxes.
and
it's
reasonable
to
assume
that
the
same
congress
that
enacted
it
was
following
that
rule
in
the
'38
act
by
not
authorizing
taxes.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
there...
there
was
in
the
1924
act.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
again,
i...
i
view
it
not
as
a
question
of
repeal
as
such,
but--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--there
was,
but
what
happened
in
1938...
and
congress
did
this
rather
explicitly...
it
said
it
was
adopting
a
new
comprehensive
leasing
scheme.
and
in
1942
professor
cohen
described
this
in
the
most
contemporaneous
construction
of
it
as
superseding
prior
leasing
laws.
that's
his
description
at
page
87
of
the
1942
treatise.
so
what
congress
did
was
supersede
prior
leasing
laws.
and
if
you
look
at
the
1924
act--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--it...
well--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--it
was
not
repealed
because
it
still
applied
to
leases
issued
under
the
1924
act.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
the
1938
act
is
a
break
with
the
past.
section
1
of
the
act
says,
"hereafter,
unallotted
lands
on
indian
reservations
shall
be
leased
pursuant
to
the
terms
of
the
1938
act.
"
that
is
a
break
with
the
past
of
the
prior
leasing
laws,
including
the
1924
act.
and,
in
fact,
the
1924
act
itself
reinforces
that
because
it...
as
has
been
pointed
out,
the
taxing
proviso
mentioning
such
lands
refers
back
to
unallotted
lands
that
were
subject
to
leasing
under
the
1891
act.
after
1938,
no
such
lands
were
subject
to
leasing
under
the
1891
act.
and
i
don't
understand
montana
to
dispute
that
proposition.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
no.
they
were
subject
to
leasing
under
both.
this
court's
decision
in
british-american
viewed
the
1891
and
1924
acts
as
a
unit
and
said
that
there.
so
they
were...
they
were...
they
were
actually
subject
to
leasing
under
both
acts.
and
there's
another
reason
why
the
taxing
provision
can't
be
thought
to
be
carried
forward
here,
and
that's
that
it's
in
the
form
of
a
proviso.
and
this
court
has
established
a
presumption
that
a
proviso
is
ordinarily
thought
to
refer
simply
to
the
substantive
provision
to
which
it's
attached.
and
here,
as
has
been
pointed
out,
all
of
the
substantive
provisions
dealing
with
the
leasing...
the
term
of
the
lease,
et
cetera...
has
been
entirely
superseded
by
the
1938
act.
if
that's
the
case,
then
the
proviso
that
was
simply
appended
to
the
prior
substantive
leasing
authority--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
but--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
the
record
seems--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--the
record
seems
quite
unclear
in
this
case
exactly...
exactly--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--i
don't
know
any
more
than
is
in
the
record
in
this
case
and--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
they
did.
there
was
a--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--there
was
a
solicitor's
opinion
in
1956
which
is
the...
which
is
the...
which
is
the
earliest--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--in
1956.
but
as
i
mentioned,
the
earliest--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
but
from
1938
there's
no
indication
that
the
interior
department
focused
on
the
question
at
all.
in
fact,
as
i
mentioned,
the
most
contemporaneous
construction
of
the
statute
is
professor
cohen's
in
1942
saying
that
the
1938
act
superseded--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
no,
but
he
was
intimately
involved...
i
mean
not
in
a
formal
sense,
but
he's
generally
recognized
as
being
intimately
involved
in
a
manner
in
which--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
it
doesn't--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--i
do
not,
but
what
i
do
know
is
from
what
the
record
shows,
there
were
only
two
states
that
appear
to
have
done
it.
and
we
have
no
indication
that
this
is...
that
this
is
not--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--montana
appears
to
have
been
collecting
it
all
these
years.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
and...
well,
i'm
sorry.
and
new
mexico
was...
was...
was
also
collecting,
was
also
collecting.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
yes.
i'm
sorry.
i
thought...
i
thought
you
meant
was
there
a
general
pattern.
no.
the
record
certainly
shows
that
montana
and
new
mexico
were.
but
it's
also--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--yes.
but
the
leases
themselves
did
not,
to
my
knowledge--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--the
leases
themselves
do
not
reflect
the
taxing,
to
my
knowledge.
i
wanted
to
mention
one
other
thing
about
the
indian
reorganization
act,
and
that
is
that
the
taxing
authority
here
was
part
and
parcel
of
the
allotment
policy,
because
the
tax
applied
here
to
lands,
unallotted
lands
that
were
expected
to
find
their
way
into
the
full
jurisdiction
and
taxing
authority
of
the
states
when
they
passed
into
non-indian
hands.
and
the
1934
act
abandoned
the
allotment
policy.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
they
are
not...
they
are
not
binding,
but
this
court
has
indicated
that
the...
that
the
persuasive
force
of
the
views
of
an
administrative
department
depends
on
the
factors
or
various
factors,
including
whether
it
was
contemporaneous.
here
it
wasn't.
the
thoroughness
with
which
it
was
considered.
here
there's
just
a
paragraph
and
a
half
in
the
1956
opinion
on
the
subject.
so
all
of
the
factors
that
this
court
said
and
identified
in
skidmore
and
general
electric
v.
gilbert
point
against
deferring
to
the
administrative
interpretation.
