justice
o'connor
well,
ms.
boggs,
didn't
the
1924
act
by
its
own
terms,
isn't
it
limited
to
leases
issued
under
the
1891
act?
i
mean
the
taxation
authority,
along
with
everything
else
in
the
1924
act,
appears
at
least
to
be
limited
by
its
own
terms
to
leases
issued
under
the
1891
act.
justice
o'connor
i'm
referring
to
the
entire
1924
act
and
asking
you
if
it
doesn't
just
apply
to
leases
issued
pursuant
to
the
1891
act?
justice
o'connor
ms.
whiteing,
if...
if
the
ninth
circuit
is
correct
in
this
case,
what
are
the
implications
for
state
taxation
of
the
producers
of
the
oil
and
gas
leases,
the
non-indians?
justice
o'connor
well,
i'm
asking
what
you
think
the
implications
are
for
that
in
the
event
the
ninth
circuit
is
correct.
justice
o'connor
yes.
i'm
asking
what
you
think
the
implications
are,
not
what
somebody
else
might
argue.
justice
o'connor
is
it
an
issue
in
the
case
when
it
goes
back
to
the
court
below
in
this
case?
justice
o'connor
wasn't
that...
yes,
wasn't
the
remand
specifically
for
that
determination?
