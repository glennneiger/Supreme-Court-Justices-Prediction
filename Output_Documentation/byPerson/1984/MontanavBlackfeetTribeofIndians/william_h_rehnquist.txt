justice
rehnquist
of
course,
the
court
of
appeals
said
that
the
1924
provision
wasn't
repealed,
didn't
it?
i
mean
it
didn't
take
the
position
that
it
had
been
repealed.
justice
rehnquist
you
feel
that
the
1924
act
standing
by
its
terms
does
apply
to
the
leases
which
are
sought
to
be
taxed
here?
justice
rehnquist
but
i
don't
think
anyone
opposes
you
on
that
point
is
what
i'm
trying
to
get
at.
i
mean
the
ninth
circuit
didn't
say
it
was
repealed.
you
obviously
don't
feel
it's
been
repealed.
justice
rehnquist
they
left
it
in
limbo.
justice
rehnquist
well,
you
think
that
the
proviso
in
the
1924
act
that
the
production
of
oil
and
gas
and
other
minerals
on
such
lands
may
be
taxed
by
the
state
in
which
such
lands
are
located
includes
lands
that
are
leased
pursuant
to
the
1938
act.
justice
rehnquist
referring
back
to
the
first
sentence
of
the
act,
that
unallotted
land
on
indian
reservations
other
than
the
five
civilized
tribes.
justice
rehnquist
in
your
view,
the
lands
on
which
taxation
is...
the
leases
on
which
taxation
is
now
sought
to
be
imposed
are
unallotted
lands.
as
described
in
the
1891
act.
yes.
justice
rehnquist
well,
you
don't
contend,
do
you,
that
the
1938
act
repealed
the
1924
act?
justice
rehnquist
so
the
1924
act
is
then
still
on
the
books.
justice
rehnquist
okay.
now,
here's...
i
want
to
read
you
some
language
from
the
1924
act,
and
you
tell
me
what
it
means.
"unallotted
land
on
indian
reservations"
is
the
very
first
five
or
six
words
of
that.
it's
quoted
at
page
37
of
the
appendix
of
the
petitioners.
it's
the
ninth
circuit's
rendition.
it
starts
out
saying,
"unallotted
land
on
indian
reservations",
with
an
exception.
then
you
go
to
the
proviso:
"that
the
production
of
oil
and
gas
and
other
minerals
on
such
lands.
"
--parenthetically,
i
take
that
to
mean
unallotted
lands...
"may
be
taxed
by
the
state
in
which
said
lands
are
located.
"
now,
don't
you
think
that
literally
applies
to
the
leases
in
this
case?
justice
rehnquist
yes.
justice
rehnquist
you
say
that
those
leases
are
not
on
unallotted
lands?
justice
rehnquist
well,
but
where
does
the
1938
act
say
anything
about
lands
subject
to
lease
under
the
1891
act?
justice
rehnquist
it's
totally
silent
on
the
subject,
isn't
it?
justice
rehnquist
but
this
proviso
for
taxation
in
the
1924
act
doesn't
say
that
leases
executed
under
the
1891
act
shall
be
subject
to
taxation.
it
says
that
leases
on
unallotted
land
shall
be
subject
to
taxation.
justice
rehnquist
well,
where
does
it
say
subject
to
the
1891
act
in
the
1924
provision?
justice
rehnquist
and
you
say
that
makes...
makes
it
applicable
only
to
lands
under
those...
leased
under
that
particular
section?
justice
rehnquist
but,
no,
the
ninth
circuit
held
that
some
of
these
leases
are
taxable,
didn't
it?
justice
rehnquist
and
you
don't
dispute
that
holding.
justice
rehnquist
well,
do
you
dispute
it
anywhere?
justice
rehnquist
well,
how
would
it
have
affected
state
tax
power
in
1935,
as
you
just
said
it
would?
justice
rehnquist
do
you
think
that
if
congress
had
never
passed
the
1938
leasing
act
that
the
'24
proviso
authorizing
taxation
would
have
been
rendered
nugatory
by
the
1934
act
alone?
justice
rehnquist
well,
then
how...
but
you
said
that
act
would
affect
taxation
in
1935.
how
would
it?
justice
rehnquist
oh,
how
would
it
have
affected--
justice
rehnquist
--how
would
it
have
affected
it
generally?
justice
rehnquist
well,
then,
you
have
to
have
another
act
in
addition
to
the
'34
act
before
your--
justice
rehnquist
--well,
i
thought
a
moment
ago
you
said
it
did.
justice
rehnquist
well,
then,
you
feel
that
even
before
the
1938
act
there
was
some
limitation
on
the
state
power
to
tax
granted
by
the
'24
act?
justice
rehnquist
where
does
the
kwapaw
tax
act
fit
into
that?
justice
rehnquist
well,
i
thought
you
started
out
talking
about
a
1937
act.
justice
rehnquist
but
that
affected
the
only
kwapaws.
justice
rehnquist
the
other
indians
were
all
still
in
1937
subject
to
the
1924
act.
justice
rehnquist
well,
mr.
kneedler,
if...
if
congress
had
this
vision
in
1937
of
just
what
an
indian
taxing
scheme
should
look
like,
it's
strange
that
it
chose
to
put
it
only
in
the
kwapaw
act
and
not
in
the
1938
act.
justice
rehnquist
but
the
kwapaw
statute
is
not
a
statute
that
applies
beyond
the
kwapaws,
is
it?
