justice
jr.
well,
are
you
saying
that
the
'38
act
completely
replaced
the
'24
act?
justice
jr.
so
nothing
at
all
was
left
of
the
'24
act
provisions.
justice
jr.
that's
what
i
mean.
justice
jr.
but
the
1938
act
applies
to
leases
after
1938,
is
that--
justice
jr.
--and
the
1938
act
has
no
authority
to
the
state
tax.
justice
jr.
and
you're
saying
in
the
'38
act
there's
no
express
weight.
