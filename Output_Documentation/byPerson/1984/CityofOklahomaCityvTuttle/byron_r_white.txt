justice
white
did
the
trial
judge,
in
his
instructions,
define
what
a
policy
was?
justice
white
did
he
say
anything
about
negligence
or
gross...
or
recklessness?
justice
white
did
he
say
that
that
was
enough
to...
that
was
enough
to
amount
to
a
policy?
justice
white
and
did
he
say
that
a
single
instance,
or
did
he
imply
that
a
single
instance
of
gross
negligence
or
recklessness
or
disregard
could
amount
to
a
policy?
justice
white
there
were
no
objections
to
that?
justice
white
i
thought
part
of
your
argument
and
part
of
the
question
that
you
raised
in
your
cert
petition
was
that
a
single
instance
of
gross
negligence
or
of
careless
disregard,
reckless
disregard,
could
never
amount
to
a
policy.
justice
white
that
is
the
heart
of
your
case,
isn't
it?
justice
white
and
there
was
also
no
objection
to
the
trial
judge
saying
to
the
jury
that
the
issue
of
policy
is
a
question
of
fact
for
the
jury.
but
if
you
are
going
to
define
a
policy,
that
a
policy
can
be
made
out
by
a
single
act
of
gross
negligence,
that
is
a
legal
proposition.
justice
white
well--
justice
white
--and
the
court
of
appeals
seems
to
have
agreed
that
a
single
instance
of
gross
negligence
could
amount
to
a
policy.
justice
white
and
you
think
the
question
has
been
preserved
all
the
way?
justice
white
well,
that
may
be,
but
if
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed
on
some
ground
that
the
policy
was
negligent
training
or
deliberate
disregard
of
rights
in
training,
if
that's
the
policy
they
identified...
and
if
they
were
wrong
in
that,
i
don't
know
that
we
should
affirm
on
your
ground.
justice
white
do
you
agree
that
the
trial
court
instructed
the
jury
that
a
single
instance
of
gross
negligence,
or
however
you
want
to
describe
it,
that
you
may
infer
a
policy
from
that?
justice
white
do
you
agree
or
not?
yes
or
no?
justice
white
so
you
do
agree
with
that?
justice
white
so
that
it's
possible
that
the
jury
concluded
that
there
was
a
single
instance
of
gross
negligence,
and
that
was
a
policy,
was
enough
for
a
policy.
and
didn't
the
court
of
appeals
agree
to
that?
justice
white
yeah.
well,
didn't
the
court
of
appeals
agree
that
a
policy
could
be
made
out
from
a
single
instance
of
gross
negligence?
justice
white
is
that
a
question
of
law
or
of
fact?
justice
white
well,
certainly
the
trial
judge
seemed
to
think
so.
justice
white
although
he
did
instruct
the
jury,
as
a
matter
of
law,
that
it
could
be
made
out
from
a
single
instance.
