we
will
hear
arguments
first
this
morning
in
the
city
of
oklahoma
city
v.
tuttle.
mr.
bailey,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
burger
by
that,
do
you
mean
that
they
might
have
introduced
evidence
that
in
the
previous
calendar
year,
13
fleeing
persons
had
been
shot
with
no
further
explanation?
chief
justice
burger
is
that
the
kind
of
evidence
that
you
say
would
have
tended
to
support
their
case?
chief
justice
burger
is
it
not
true
that
many,
or
at
least
a
considerable
number
of
small
communities
elect,
by
popular
election,
some
of
their
police
people,
sheriffs,
and
constables?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
hughes.
chief
justice
burger
well,
the
jury's
verdict
would
suggest,
at
least
it
is
susceptible
of
a
meaning
that
the
jury
thought
that
the
police
officer
did
have
a
reasonable
basis
to
think
his
life
was
in
danger,
and
therefore
they
excused
him.
chief
justice
burger
how
it
was
portrayed
to
you
or
to
some
judge
is
not
as
important
as
how
the
jury
viewed
him.
now,
the
jury
returned
a
verdict
indicating
that
they
thought
he
was
justified.
at
least
that's
the
way
i
would
read
the
jury's
verdict;
that
he
was
justified
in
what
he
did.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
have
anything
further,
mr.
bailey?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
hear
none.
thank
you,
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
we'll
hear
arguments
next
in
burger
king
corporation
v.
rudzewicz.
