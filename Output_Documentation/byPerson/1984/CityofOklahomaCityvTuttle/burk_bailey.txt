mr.
burk
bailey
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court,
on
the
night
of
october
4,
1980,
an
oklahoma
city
police
officer
named
julian
rotramel
shot
and
killed
a
man
named
william
tuttle.
the
shooting
occurred
outside
a
bar
in
oklahoma
city
called
the
"we'll
do
club".
the
bar
was
located
in
what
plaintiff's
expert
called
an
interstitial
city
area,
what
he
described
as
a
rough
part
of
town.
the
events
leading
up
to
the
shooting
are
unusual.
the
evidence
was
that
mr.
tuttle
was
a
frequent
patron
of
the
bar,
and
that
day
he
had
been
in
and
out
of
it
several
different
times,
he
was
said
to
be
despondent
over
a
quarrel
he
had
had
with
his
wife,
and
his
despondency
had
caused
him
on
a
previous
occasion
following
a
quarrel
with
his
wife
to
slash
his
wrist
in
the
bar.
he
was...
he
called
the
oklahoma
city
police
department
and
reported
an
armed
robbery
in
progress
and
described
to
the
dispatcher
the
armed
robber
as
himself.
he
said,
"he's
a
white
male.
"
"he's
about
37
years
old.
"
"he
has
glasses,
brown
hair.
"
and
such
as
that.
the
dispatcher
put
out
an
all-points
bulletin
to
all
officers,
and
there
were
two
officers
patrolling
separately
in
the
general
vicinity
of
the
bar.
one
of
them
was
julian
rotramel,
a
rookie
police
officer
who
had
been
out
of
the
oklahoma
city
police
academy
about
ten
months
following
an
18-week
training
exercise
at
the
oklahoma
city
police
academy.
he
was
22
years
old
at
the
time.
another
officer
patrolling
in
the
general
vicinity
was
a
veteran
police
officer
named
lennox.
rotramel
arrived
on
the
scene
almost
within
one
minute
after
he
received
the
call.
he
was
within
eight
or
nine
blocks
of
the
club.
what
happened
after
he
went
into
the
club
is
in
sharp
dispute
in
the
testimony.
rotramel's
testimony
was
that
he
walked
into
the
darkened
bar...
it
was
a
so-called
"blind"
building,
concrete
blocks,
with
a
single
door
that
operated
on
a
trap
spring
that
closed
behind
you...
and
found
the
person
later
found
to
be
tuttle;
in
any
event,
the
person
who
matched
the
description
of
the
robber
at
the
bar,
and
that
tuttle
walked
toward
him
as
if
to
leave
through
the
door
behind
him.
rotramel
said
that
he
put
his
hand
on
his
shirt
or
arm
or
chest,
and
anyway
he
held
him,
and
that
tuttle
said
something
that's
in
dispute.
why
can't
i
leave,
or
something
like
that.
and
rotramel
replies,
"i've
got
a
call.
"
"stay
put.
"
it's
rotramel's
testimony
that
tuttle
tried
twice
to
reach
for
his
boot,
and
that
he
straightened
him
up.
the
two
bartenders,
female
bartenders
in
the
bar,
testified
they
saw
tuttle
make
no
such
action
to
retrieve
anything
from
his
boot.
rotramel
lighted
his
flashlight,
it
was
dark
in
there,
and
signaled
to
the
bartender
to
come
toward
him.
his
testimony
was
he
asked
if
there
was
a
robbery
in
progress,
and
that
she
uttered
only
one
word,
"robbery",
and
it
doesn't
indicate
whether
it
was
with
a
question
mark
like
"robbery"?
or
whether
it
was
"robbery".
it's
not
clear
in
the
record.
in
any
event,
it
does
seem
to
be
clear
that
tuttle
then
broke
loose
from
the
officer's
grasp
and
in
the
words
of
the
plaintiff's
witnesses,
darted
through
the
door
and
that
rotramel
spun
around
and
went
through
the
door
after
him,
in
pursuit.
and
whether
the
door
slammed
shut
or
was
propped
open
by
the
officer's
foot
is
also
disputed.
in
any
event,
at
some
point
in
whirling
after
him,
the
officer
drew
his
service
revolver.
outside
the
bar,
there
was
no
witness
other
than
rotramel.
he
said
that
he
saw
tuttle
down
in
a
crouched
position
with
his
hand
going
for
his
boot.
he
saw
no
weapon.
he
said
he
had
hollered
"halt"
when
the
man
went
out,
and
"halt"
when
he
saw
him
crouched
with
his
hand
in
his
boot,
and
that
tuttle
looked
over
his
shoulder
at
him
and
started
to
come
up,
and
he
fired.
it
was
plaintiff's
version
that
because
of
the
exit
wound
on
tuttle,
it
could
not
have
happened
the
way
rotramel
said
it
happened,
because
the
bullet
exited
higher
than
it
entered
in
the
back.
so
he
must
have
been
in
a
bent-over
position.
so,
in
any
event,
he
didn't
come
straight
up.
he
was
still
in
a
crouched
position.
mr.
burk
bailey
yes,
ma'am.
mr.
burk
bailey
both,
your
honor.
we
take
the
position
that
under
no
circumstance
was
the
evidence
sufficient
to
go
to
the
jury
because
there
was
no
proof
of
any
official
policy
or
customs
promulgated
by
the
city
of
oklahoma
city
under
the
monell
standard,
and
that
the
court's
instruction
on
a
single
incident
deemed
sufficient
to
let
the
tryers
of
fact
infer
an
official
policy
to
deprive
someone
of
their
constitutional
rights
was--
mr.
burk
bailey
--the
objection
was
made,
your
honor,
not
by...
i
was
not
at
the
trial,
but
the
objection
was
made
in
chambers,
i
am
advised,
and
then
following...
off
the
record...
and
then
following
the
giving
of
the
instructions,
the
trial
judge
summoned
the
counsel
to
the
bench,
at
which
point
there
is
an
objection
in
the
record
by
the
city
attorney,
the
assistant
city
attorney
trying
the
case,
which
is
ambiguous.
he
says,
"we
object
to
that
city
liability
instruction
that
contains
a
single
instant
language.
"
plaintiff
in
their
brief
take
the
position
that
that
is
an
insufficient
objection
and
doesn't
comport
with
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure
that
says
it
must
be
specific.
but
i
am
advised
the
trial
judge
well
knew
what
the
objection
was.
that
had
been
aired
in
considerable
detail
in
chambers,
and
that
it
was
just
to
preserve
the
record
at
the...
on
the
record,
as
it
were,
following
the
giving
of
the
instructions.
mr.
burk
bailey
yes,
your
honor,
there
is
because
this
was
also
raised
in
pretrial
briefs,
that
is,
the
single
incident
objection
of
the
city.
it
was
a
very
central
part
of
dispute
between
these
parties
from
the
beginning.
mr.
burk
bailey
i
think
there's
no
question
of
that,
your
honor.
mr.
burk
bailey
we
take
the
position
there
was
no
other
evidence
on
the
issue
of
policy
or
custom.
there
was
evidence
from
the
plaintiff's
expert
that
the
training
this
officer
received
was
grossly
inadequate
to
deal
with
an
armed
robbery
situation.
the
case
was
tried
on
that
basis,
as
i
see
it,
your
honor.
the
plaintiff's
case
was
predicated
on
a
contention
that
the
state...
that
the
city
was
grossly
negligent
in
the
training
that
it
gave
officer
rotramel,
and
that
that
constituted
a
deliberate
indifference
to
the
rights
of
the
citizens
of
oklahoma
city.
mr.
burk
bailey
well,
that
is
our
position,
your
honor,
that
that
in
and
of
itself
is
no
showing
of
an
official
policy.
to
state,
it
seems
to
me,
that
the
city
of
oklahoma
city
has
an
official
policy
of
inadequately
training
its
officers
is
preposterous.
and
there
was
no
proof
of
any
pattern
or
tradition
of
misbehavior
or
any
other
evidence
whatever
of
any
aberrant
police
behavior.
there
was...
this
record
is
barren
of
that.
mr.
burk
bailey
well,
i
think
that
that
would
be--
mr.
burk
bailey
--i'm
not
even
sure
if
i
would
say
that,
but
that
is
evidence
that
certainly
would
point
in
that
direction,
that
there
would
be
some
misbehavior
on
the
part
of
the
police,
not
necessarily
shootings.
i
don't
really
mean
it
has
to
rise
to
that
level
of
seriousness,
but
some
showing
of
an
insensitivity
to
constitutional
rights
that
the
city
council
would
be
able
to
infer
that
the
city's
training
was
not
adequate.
i
would
suggest,
your
honor,
that
it's
a
difficult
proposition,
logically,
to
say
that
the
city
can
be
held
to
any
negligence
standard
for
training
its
police
officers.
but
i
don't
need
to
say
that
in
this
case
because
there's
no
proof
of
any
other
instance,
other
than
this
single
event,
this
single
incident.
mr.
burk
bailey
i
don't
think
it
is
enough,
your
honor.
i
don't
think
so,
because
just
recently,
about
two
months
ago,
since
our
briefs
closed,
there's
a
fourth
circuit
opinion
that
i
think
speaks
to
your
honor's
point.
there,
an
automobile
accident
victim
sued
the
city
of
newport
news,
saying
that
the
city
had
grossly,
negligently
trained
its
police
officers
in
knowing
how
to
give
medical
treatment
to
an
automobile
victim,
and
that
she
had
been
injured,
her
spine
was
injured
as
a
result
of
them
putting
her
in
a
cab
instead
of
in
an
ambulance.
and
if
you...
there's
no
logical
stopping
point,
we
would
submit,
if
you
can
predicate
municipal
liability
solely
on
a
contention
that
they
negligently
trained
an
officer
or
a
fireman
or
a
meter
reader.
there
is...
it
opens
up
section
1983
to
simple
tort
actions.
mr.
burk
bailey
i've
thought
about
that,
your
honor,
and
frankly
i
doubt
that
there
is
a
constitutional
duty
on
the
part
of
a
city
to
train
police
officers
at
all.
i
expect
that
there
are
hundreds
of
municipalities
that
hire
police
officers
with
no
training
at
all.
and
indeed,
in
the
languirand
case
in
the
fifth
circuit,
recently
decided,
the
officer
who
shot
the
suspected
prowler
had
no
training
whatsoever.
mr.
burk
bailey
they
do
in
the
little
town
i
grew
up
in,
your
honor.
and
i
don't
know,
i
suspect
there
are
many
that
do
that.
mr.
burk
bailey
yes,
your
honor,--
mr.
burk
bailey
--tremendous
amount
of
testimony
about
that.
and
that,
in
fact,
was
the
central
part
of
the
case.
mr.
burk
bailey
i
think
that's
what
it
was
offered
for,
your
honor.
it
was
offered
to
show
he
was
negligently
trained.
he
went
to
the
oklahoma
city
police
academy,
which
the
former
oklahoma
city
police
chief
testified
was
rated
by
the
fbi
as
the
third
best
in
the
nation,
for
18
weeks,
700
hours
of
training.
the
plaintiff,
through
dr.
kirkham,
a
criminologist
from
florida,
testified
that
he
had
studied
the
curriculum
and
that
it
did
not
contain
more
than
24
minutes
of
time
devoted
to
the
response
to
an
armed
robbery
call,
and
that
that
was
grossly
deficient.
that
was
his
testimony.
the
testimony
from
the
police
side
was
different
from
that.
it
was
that
the
training
was
extremely
sophisticated
and
thorough
and
complete.
the
problem
i
see
with
that,
your
honor,
is
that
the
curriculum
was
extensive.
part
of
it
is
established
by
the
state
law
of
oklahoma,
what
a
police
officer
must
study.
it
would
be
difficult,
i
would
think
for
the
court
to
fashion
a
test
as
to
what
curriculum
needs
to
be
taught
in
every
city
police
department
in
the
country.
there
vast
differences
of
opinion
about
that,
i
think,
among
knowledgeable
professionals.
mr.
burk
bailey
i
doubt
that
you
would
have
to,
your
honor.
i
think
we
would
like
for
the
court
to
do
so.
it
just
strikes
us
that
a
contention
that
the
training
an
officer
receives
is
the
springboard
to
municipal
liability
is
a
hazardous
test.
mr.
burk
bailey
no.
not
at
all,
your
honor.
that
is,
we
think
that's
our
strongest
point,
and
we
are
urging
that
to
the
court.
but
we
think
that
there
was
insufficient--
mr.
burk
bailey
--your
honor,
i
think
that
points
up
an
interesting
distinction
in
this
case.
if
that
were
the
policy,
shoot
to
kill,
as
you
suggest,
or
shoot
on
mere
suspicion,
it
seems
to
me
that
policy
just
wouldn't
pass
constitutional
muster.
that
policy
would
not.
here,
the
policy
of
the
city
of
oklahoma
city
on
the
use
of
firearms
was,
by
plaintiff's
own
expert
witness,
ideal.
and
the
position
taken
in
the
trial
court
by
plaintiff
was
that
rotramel
departed
from
city
policy
which
said
an
officer
can
use
his
weapon
only
in
defense
of
life
when
the
suspect
is
armed
or
threatening
great
bodily
harm,
and
he
must
always
use
the
utmost
discretion
with
due
respect
for
the
sanctity
of
human
life,
that
sort
of
thing.
mr.
burk
bailey
your
honor,
there's
a
dichotomy
there.
the
city
policy
now,
in
plaintiff's
brief,
is
being
questioned.
at
the
trial,
it
never
was.
the
contention
was
that
the
officer
was
grossly
inadequately
trained,
not
that
the
city
policy
was
bad,
but
that
the
policy
in
the
sense
that
they
grossly
inadequately
trained
the
officer
was
flawed.
that
was
the
contention
at
trial.
mr.
burk
bailey
that's
correct,
your
honor,
not
that...
i
doubt
in
all...
i
doubt
in
all
truth
that
the
training
the
officer
received
had
anything
to
do
with
this
incident.
i've
thought
about
that.
i
think
if
they--
mr.
burk
bailey
--i'm
not...
the
jury
found
in
favor
of
the
officer,
your
honor,
as
you
will
recall.
they
found
in
favor
of
the
officer
and
against
the
plaintiff
on
the
plaintiff's
suit
against
the
officer,
presumably
on
the
good
faith
qualified
immunity
that
exists
for
the
benefit
of
city
employees,
but
we
don't
know
that
for
sure,
and
against
the
city.
and
that
has
been
the
pattern,
your
honor,
in
these
cases
that
are
cited...
some
are
not
cited.
in
very
recent
cases,
there's
an
awful
lot
of
litigation
in
this
area
going
on.
but
the
juries
return
verdicts
in
favor
of
the
officers
and
against
the
municipality.
and
they
are...
in
the
cases
we've
cited,
it's
astonishing
that
they
are
all
for
$1,500,000,
all
four
of
them.
mr.
burk
bailey
it's
not
the
same
at
all,
your
honor.
monell
was
a
specific,
express,
written,
official
policy
of
the
city
which
didn't
pass
constitutional
muster.
mr.
burk
bailey
that's
true.
yes,
your
honor,
i
agree
with
that.
and
this
query,
whether
there's
any
constitutional
right
that
the
body
has
to
a
certain
quality
of
training
by
city
employees.
i'm
not
certain
that's
true.
mr.
burk
bailey
i
don't
recall
that
he
did,
your
honor.
he
might
have.
mr.
burk
bailey
a
great
deal.
mr.
burk
bailey
i
think
he
did,
your
honor.
mr.
burk
bailey
specifically.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
burk
bailey
there
was
an
objection
to
that
language,
as
i
was
responding
to
justice
o'connor.
mr.
burk
bailey
well,
that's
true,
your
honor,
and
that
was
objected
to.
mr.
burk
bailey
yes.
mr.
burk
bailey
i
quite
agree,
your
honor.
mr.
burk
bailey
there
was
a
motion
for
directed
verdict
made
by
the
city
at
the
close
of
the
plaintiff's
proof,
which
was
denied
on
the
single
incident
basis.
there
was
a
motion
for
judgment
notwithstanding
the
verdict
made.
mr.
burk
bailey
well,
that's...
i
think
they
had
to
agree
with
that,
because
that's
the
only
proof
in
the
record.
mr.
burk
bailey
oh,
yes.
i
don't
think
there
is
any
serious
question
about
that,
your
honor.
mr.
burk
bailey
that's
correct.
mr.
burk
bailey
i'm
not
sure
there
is
anything
in
the
record
about
it.
rotramel
departed
the
police
force
shortly
thereafter
for
other
employment.
mr.
burk
bailey
and
he
went
to
work
for,
i
think,
an
oil
company
or
something.
mr.
burk
bailey
well,
that's
right.
mr.
burk
bailey
i
think
the
situation
was
this.
your
honor
has
asked
me
what
happened.
as
i
was
beginning
to
state
a
moment
ago
to
justice
stevens'
question,
i
doubt
that
if
they
had
given
this
officer
five
years
of
training
on
responding
to
armed
robbery,
it
would
have
had
a
thing
in
the
world
to
do
with
this
incident.
you've
got
an
armed
robbery
call
in
a
rough
area,
in
a
dark
bar.
the
person
matches
the
description
of
the
robber
precisely.
he
makes...
he
darts
out;
it's
dark.
i
think
the
officer
said,
"it
wasn't
a
question
of
apprehending
him;
i
thought
my
life
was
in
danger.
"
"i
thought
i
was
doing
what
i
had
to
do
to
save
myself.
"
and
i
suspect
that
training
really
didn't
have
anything
to
do
with
that;
that
he
was
acting...
you've
got
a
very
edgy
officer
going
into
that
situation.
it
was
the
plaintiff's
case
at
trial
that
the
officer
should
not
have
gone
in
that
bar
alone;
that
he
should
have
waited
for
a
back
up.
but
they
are
always
worried
about
hostage
situations.
we
had
a
horrible
situation
in
oklahoma
city.
well,
my
time
is
up,
your
honor,
and
i'll
complete
that.
mr.
burk
bailey
i
don't
know
whether
it's
printed
in
the
court
of
appeals
decision
or
not,
your
honor.
i
don't
remember.
i
think
it
was.
mr.
burk
bailey
well,
it's
this
instruction,
your
honor.
it's
on
page
44
of
the
appendix,
where
the
court
says
this:
"absent
more
evidence
of
supervisory
indifference,
such
as
acquiescence
in
a
prior
matter
of
conduct,
official
policy
such
as
to
impose
liability
on
the
city
of
oklahoma
city
under
the
federal
civil
rights
act,
cannot
ordinarily
be
inferred
from
a
single
incident
of
illegality
such
as
the
first
excessive
use
of
force
to
stop
a
suspect;
but
a
single,
unusually
excessive
use
of
force
may
be
sufficiently
out
of
the
ordinary
to
warrant
an
inference
that
it
was
attributable
to
inadequate
training
or
supervision
amounting
to
deliberate
indifference
or
gross
negligence
on
the
part
of
the
officials
in
charge.
"
mr.
burk
bailey
if
the
court
has
any
questions
i'll
respond.
if
not,
i'm
finished.
