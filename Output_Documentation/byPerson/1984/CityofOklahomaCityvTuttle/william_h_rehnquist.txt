justice
rehnquist
is
there
anything
in
the
record
that
would
enable
us
to
figure
out
for
ourselves
whether
the
trial
judge
full
well
knew
the
meaning
of
the
objection?
justice
rehnquist
so
you
say
the
term
"single
incident"
used
by
the
assistant
city
attorney
had
taken
on
a
nomenclature
that
meant
something
more
than
just
the
words
alone
might
mean
to
the
trial
judge?
justice
rehnquist
well,
juries
return
verdicts
in
favor
of
railroads,
or
against
railroads
and
in
favor
of
engineers,
too,
in
personal
injury
cases.
isn't
part
of
your
argument,
as
least
as
i
understood
you
to
have
been
previously
making
it,
that
no
matter
what
one
says
about
the
oklahoma
city
policy
of
training
officers,
that
isn't
the
same
kind
of
policy
as
the
new
york
city
policy
about
maternity
leaves
that
was
involved
in
monell.
justice
rehnquist
and
it
also
was
a
policy
that
directly
affected
constitutional
rights.
justice
rehnquist
mr.
hughes,
a
moment
ago
you
said
that
the
policy
that
was
relied
upon
by
you
as
plaintiff
was
a
policy
of
oklahoma
city
to
allow
shooting
on
suspicion.
i
am
looking
at
the
court
of
appeals'
opinion,
page
7a
and
8a
of
the
petition
for
certiorari.
and
it
seems
to
me
they
devote
one
paragraph
to
the
question
of
policy
there,
and
the
only
policy
they
talk
about
is
negligence
and
gross
negligence
and
supervising.
they
don't
mention
the
policy
that
you
refer
to.
are
you
saying
that
the
court
of
appeals
upheld
the
policy
contention
on
the
basis
that
you're
talking
about
of
a
policy
of
shooting
on
suspicion?
justice
rehnquist
i
think
you
can
answer
the
question
yes
or
no.
justice
rehnquist
the
court
of
appeals
mentioned
in
its
opinion
the
policy
which
you
refer
to
of
shooting
on
suspicion?
justice
rehnquist
did
the
court
of
appeals
mention
that
in
its
opinion?
justice
rehnquist
of
course,
what
we've
taken
is
the
court
of
appeals'
judgment.
it
might
be
that
if
we
were
versed
on
this
issue,
the
court
of
appeals
might
affirm
on
your
theory
on
remand.
but
all
we
have
before
us
is
the
court
of
appeals'
opinion.
that's
the
basis
that
they
have
said
was
sufficient.
and
that
just
talks
about
training.
justice
rehnquist
well,
i
don't
know
how
i
could
make
it
any
more
clear.
i
said
the
court
of
appeals'
opinion,
when
it
talks
about
policy,
speaks
only
of
training
and
grossly
negligent
training.
that's
all
we
have
before
us
in
this
case
as
a
matter
of
policy
from
the
court
of
appeals'
opinions.
you
may
be
absolutely
right
that
there
were
18
different
policies
offered
in
the
trial
court,
but
the
court
of
appeals
discussed
only
one.
justice
rehnquist
i
thought
a
minute
ago,
you
said
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
discuss
the
shoot
to
kill
policy.
the
court
of
appeals'
opinion
is
about
eight
pages
long.
it
devotes
about
one
page
to
policy.
did
it
or
did
it
not
discuss
the
shoot
to
kill
policy?
justice
rehnquist
well,
did
it
discuss
it
in
some
other
context?
justice
rehnquist
well,
where
did
it
discuss
the
shoot
to
kill
policy
in
the
context
of
the
overall
cases?
justice
rehnquist
but
you
are
confident
that
the
court
of
appeals
did
discuss
it?
