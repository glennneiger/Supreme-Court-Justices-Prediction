justice
o'connor
mr.
bailey?
justice
o'connor
are
you
objecting
to
the
jury
instructions
or
to
the
sufficiency
of
the
evidence
in
the
case?
it
isn't
clear
to
me.
justice
o'connor
did
you
make
your
objections
to
the
instructions
before
the
trial
court?
justice
o'connor
well,
mr.
bailey,
would
you
take
the
position
that
liability
could
be
imposed
under
monell,
based
on
a
single
incident
of
misconduct,
coupled
with
independent
evidence
of
inadequate
training
or
supervision?
is
that
enough?
justice
o'connor
what
if
the
city
or
town
adopted
a
policy
of
hiring
police
with
no
training
at
all?
can
that
amount
to
the
equivalent
of
knowledge,
constructive
knowledge?
justice
o'connor
mr.
hughes,
it
seemed
to
me
that
basically
the
theory
proceeded
on
by
the
plaintiffs
below
was
that
an
isolated
incident,
plus
evidence
of
the
training
that
was
given
police
officers,
was
enough
to
establish
the
liability
here.
and
what
that
argument
boils
down
to,
as
far
as
i
can
understand
it,
is
that
other
procedures
in
terms
of
training
a
police
officer
would
have
reduced
the
likelihood
that
officer
rotramel
would
have
used
excessive
force.
is
that
the
thrust
of
the
theory?
justice
o'connor
well,
didn't
rizzo
v.
goode
reject
that
very
approach
as
the
basis
for
liability
under
1983?
it
seemed
to
me
that
in
rizzo,
this
court
rejected
that.
justice
o'connor
well,
didn't
rizzo
deal
with
exactly
that
situation
for
purposes
of
1983
liability?
