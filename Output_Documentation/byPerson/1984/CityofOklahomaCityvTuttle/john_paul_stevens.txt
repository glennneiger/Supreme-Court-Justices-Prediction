justice
stevens
mr.
bailey,
it
seems
to
me
you
are
making
quite
a
different
argument
than
the
question
presented
in
the
cert
petition,
which
was
focused
on
the
single
incident
point,
rather
than
whether
training
can
ever
be...
kind
of
training
can
ever
be
a
policy.
are
you
abandoning
your
single
incident--
justice
stevens
--on
that
point,
is
it
your
position
that
the
single
incident
could
never
give
rise
to
1983?
i
was
thinking
about
a
hypothetical
case
where
you
might
have
a
policy
of
shoot
to
kill
traffic
offenders
or
something,
an
absurd
hypothetical,
i
recognize.
but
suppose
you
had
a
very
extreme,
very
dangerous
policy,
and
the
first
implementation
of
the
policy
resulted
in
a
tragic
death.
could
that
ever
constitute
a
violation?
justice
stevens
but
then
if
that's
your
theory,
you
are
really
saying
that
the
evidence
doesn't
show
an
invalid
policy.
and
that
would
be
true
if
there
were
three
incidents
or
nine
incidents
or
one
incident,
i
suppose.
justice
stevens
well,
and
yet
the
instructions
do
say
the
existence
of
such
a
policy
is
a
question
of
fact
for
you
to
determine,
and
that
was
the
question;
whether
there
was
a
policy
of
putting
unqualified
people
on
the
street.
justice
stevens
but
the
jury
seems
to
come
to
a
different
conclusion.
we
have
to
deal
with
what
the
jury
decided
on
the
basis
of
instructions.
justice
stevens
may
i
just
ask
one
quick
question,
if
i
may?
in
response
to
justice
white,
you
said
that
the
instructions
did
refer
to
the
single
incident
business.
are
you
referring
to
some
instruction
other
than
the
one
quoted
by
the
court
of
appeals,
or
is
it
supposedly
the
same--
justice
stevens
--i'd
be...
it
would
help
me
to
know
what
instruction
you
are
complaining
of.
maybe
you'll
do
it
on
your
rebuttal.
i
don't
want
to
use
up
all
your
time.
i,
frankly,
don't
find
what
you
describe
in
your
colloquy.
justice
stevens
i
see.
justice
stevens
may
i
ask
you
a
question?
i
didn't
realize
you
were
just
finishing
your
argument.
supposing
you
had
a
case
in
which
the
city
didn't
train
their
officers
how
to
drive,
and
they
put
an
officer
in
a
car,
he
went
out
and
got
in
an
automobile
accident
and
killed
somebody,
just
because
he
didn't
know
how
to
drive.
1983
liability
or
not
under
your
theory?
justice
stevens
just
total...
they
just
let
people
out
who
didn't
even
have
a
driver's
license.
justice
stevens
the
policy
was,
we
don't
train
people
to
drive.
we
hire
them
and
we
assume
they
can
drive.
we
don't
even
ask
them.
justice
stevens
but
there's
not
any
use
of
guns
or
anything.
it's
just
an
automobile
accident.
they

pedestrian.
