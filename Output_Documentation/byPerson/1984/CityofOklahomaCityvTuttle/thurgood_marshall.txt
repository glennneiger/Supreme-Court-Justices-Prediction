justice
marshall
counsel,
the
respondent
brought
out
the
policy
of
oklahoma,
which
was
not
to
shoot
in
a
circumstance
like
this.
justice
marshall
is
there
anything
in
the
evidence,
as
to
what,
if
anything,
was
done
by
the
city
to
the
police
officer?
justice
marshall
oh,
i
see.
justice
marshall
what
worries
me
is,
the
jury
couldn't
just
have
ignored
that
fact,
that
the
policy,
as
expressed
by
the
city,
was
not
to
do
what
this
man
did.
justice
marshall
and
then
the
man
innocently,
it
seems
to
me,
did
something
wrong.
what
happened?
justice
marshall
just
one
little
minor
point.
you
said
it
was
a
well-lit
bar.
why
did
he
need
to
turn
on
the
flashlight?
justice
marshall
in
a
brightly-lit
bar?
justice
marshall
well,
you
said
it
was
a
well-lit
bar.
justice
marshall
well-lit.
justice
marshall
and
you
still
need
a
searchlight.
justice
marshall
i'd
rather
not
emphasize
unimportant
points.
going
back
to
your
statement
about
whether
the
officer
thought
his
life
was
in
danger,
if
the
officer
in
a
given
situation,
an
officer
believes
that
his
life
is
in
danger,
you
are
saying
he
is
not
entitled
to
shoot?
