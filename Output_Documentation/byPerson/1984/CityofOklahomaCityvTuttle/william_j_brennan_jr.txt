justice

but,
mr.
bailey,
was
there
other
evidence
besides
the
single
incident
on
the
questions
of
policy
or
custom?
justice
jr.
but
did
not
bear
on
whether
there
was
a
policy
of
training
which
was
inadequate?
justice
jr.
mr.
bailey--
justice
jr.
--you
mentioned,
i
think,
that
this
officer
had
been
only
recently
graduated
from
a
police
training
academy.
was
there
any
evidence
of
the
kind
of
training
he
had
at
the
academy?
justice
jr.
was
that
offered
as
a
predicate
for
the
conclusion
that
there
was
a
practice,
and
that
the
practice
was
inadequate
to
train
this
officer?
justice
jr.
well,
independently
of
the
challenge
you
make
to
the
instruction,
suppose
we
were
to
agree
with
you
that
the
instruction
was
error.
would
we
then
have
to
address
whether
the
rest
of
the
evidence
sufficed
to
support
a
finding
of
policy
or
custom?
