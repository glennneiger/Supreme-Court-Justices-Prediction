mr.
carl
hughes
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
this
is
an
appeal
from
the
jury
verdict
rendered
in
the
western
district
of
oklahoma,
as
affirmed
by
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
tenth
circuit.
the
issue
before
this
court
is
not
whether
the
city
of
oklahoma
city
should
have
to
pay
damages
to
the
estate
of
william
adam
tuttle;
the
overall
question
of
liability
depends
on
a
number
of
issues
which
are
simply
not
before
this
court.
first,
liability
depends
in
large
part
upon
resolution
of
factual
issues
which
were
resolved
by
the
jury
in
the
case
and
are
subject
to
limited
review,
due
to
the
provisions
of
the
seventh
amendment.
second,
most
of
the
legal
issues
were
addressed
in
instructions
given
by
the
court
which
were
simply
either
unobjected
to
or
objected
to
in
such
a
way
as
to
be
insufficient
under
rule
51.
and,
third,
any
other
issues,
other
issues
that
have
been
discussed
here
this
morning
simply
aren't
raised
by
the
cert
petition.
in
this
case,
the
policy,
the
case
was
submitted
to
the
jury
in
the
court's
instructions
on
three
separate
theories;
one,
that
the
shooting
itself
was
justified
under
the
policies
of
the
city
of
oklahoma
city.
as
i
was
interested
in
mr.
bailey's
concession
that
if
they'd
a
shoot
to
kill,
shoot
on
suspicion
policy,
that
that
would
have
been...
would
not
have
passed
constitutional
muster
and
would
have
been
a
basis
for
liability,
and
that's
precisely
what
the
evidence
showed
at
the
trial.
the
chief
of
police
testified,
and
it
was
a
matter
of
evidence,
it
was
a
matter
of
factual
issue
that
was
resolved
against
the
city,
that
the
officer
was
entitled
to
shoot
on
the
basis
of
suspicion,
if
he
had
any
suspicion
that
his
life
was
in
danger.
very
briefly,
the
facts,
as
opposed
to
being
in
a
light
most
favorable
to
the
city,
in
a
light
most
favorable
to
mr.
tuttle,
who
prevailed
in
the
trial
court,
showed
that
mr.
rotramel
did
go
into
the
bar
and
was
advised...
was
not
a
dark
bar,
but
it
was
a
well-lit
bar...
that
he
was
advised
upon
entering
the
bar,
he
asked
about
an
armed
robbery,
the
bartender,
another
bartender
advised
him
that
there
was
no
armed
robbery
in
progress.
mr.
carl
hughes
he
used
it
merely
just
for
motion,
just
to
instruct--
mr.
carl
hughes
--i
don't
know
that
the
light
was
turned
on.
i
don't
recall
that
being
the
evidence.
mr.
carl
hughes
it
was
a
lit
bar.
mr.
carl
hughes
well,
i
took
it--
mr.
carl
hughes
--only
for
purposes
of
motion,
mr.
justice
marshall.
mr.
carl
hughes
of
course,
that
issue
is
not
preserved
and
presented
in
this
case.
i
say
that
there
has
to
be
more
than
just
a
totally
unfounded
belief
that
his
life
was
in
danger,
just
a
mere
suspicion.
and
there
was
no...
nothing
more
than
that
in
the
evidence
in
the
light
most
favorable
to
the--
mr.
carl
hughes
--that's
a
concern
that
i
have
about
an
appellate
court
reviewing
factual
determinations
that
were
made
at
the
trial.
this
court
in
the
record
doesn't
illustrate,
and
you
can't
see...
i
tried
the
case
and
i
did
see
the
timidity.
it
was
sort
of
like
mr.
creeper
leaves
the
marine
corps
and
goes
on
the
oklahoma
city
police
force
with
a
gun.
you
can't
see
the
attitude
of
rotramel.
i
mean
he
didn't,
to
me
at
least,
portray
the
attitude
of
a
clint
eastwood
dirty
harry.
mr.
carl
hughes
i
didn't...
i
respectfully
disagree...
read
that
it
went
that
far;
that
it
merely
held
that
he
was
in
good
faith
in
what
he
did.
in
other
words,
that
he
thought
he
was
complying
with
the
policy,
that
he
thought
he
was
passing
constitutional
muster,
but
that's
simply
not
what
the
facts
illustrated
and
what
the
jury
resolved.
mr.
carl
hughes
well,
that
issue,
in
terms
of--
mr.
carl
hughes
--well,
i
think
they
did;
yes.
mr.
carl
hughes
the
issue--
mr.
carl
hughes
--i
don't
recall
them
mentioning
it,
but
the
issue
wasn't
before
them
in
that
context
and
in
that
posture.
and
i
think
when
the
issues
are
resolved
in
the
trial
court,
we
take
less
up
to
the
next
level,
and
less
up
to
the
next,
and
it's
simply
a
matter
that
was
addressed
in
the
instructions,
in
unobjected
to
instructions
in
the
trial
court.
mr.
carl
hughes
well,
of
course,
that's,
in
my
view,
the
purpose
of
rule
51.
you
know,
we
have
to
object
to
the
instructions,
object
to
the
problems,
and
properly
preserve
the
error,
and
it's
simply
not
properly
preserved.
i
mean
the
only
objection
to
the
instructions
that's
in
the
record,
and
i
take
issue
with
the
statements
about
matters
that
occurred
outside
the
record,
the
only
instruction
that's
in...
the
only
objection
that's
in
the
instruction
is
quoted
in
full
at
footnote
62
at
page
45
of
our
brief.
we
make
a
second
objection,
your
honor,
particularly
to
the
one,
the
oklahoma
city
language,
the
language
in
the
light
of
the
city
of
oklahoma
city,
which
is
the
single
occurrence
language.
that
is
simply
the
only
matter
that
was
objected
to
in
the
trial
court
and
preserved
for
review,
and
i
don't
think
that
preserves
anything.
mr.
carl
hughes
well--
mr.
carl
hughes
--that
language
is
contained
in
the
instructions,
yes.
mr.
carl
hughes
yes.
mr.
carl
hughes
the
court
of
appeals
agreed
that
the
instructions
should
be
taken
as
a
whole.
mr.
carl
hughes
i
believe
that
they
did.
mr.
carl
hughes
in
the
light
of
this
case,
i
thought
it
was
a
question
of
fact.
mr.
carl
hughes
i
would
say
that's
a
fair
and
accurate
statement.
mr.
carl
hughes
he
did
say
that.
of
course,
i
don't
see
that
as
an
issue
that's...
there
were
more
issues
than
the
single...
there
were
more
theories
than
the
single
incident
theory,
than
the
shooting
itself,
that
were
presented.
training,
supervision,
as
well
as
the
policy
of
shoot
to
kill
and
shoot
to
center
mass
were
presented.
mr.
carl
hughes
i'm
sorry.
i
don't
think
i
follow
that.
mr.
carl
hughes
they
discussed
training,
supervision,
and
the
shoot
to
kill
policy,
as
i
recall.
mr.
carl
hughes
not
in
the
specific
context
that
you're
talking
about.
mr.
carl
hughes
it
discussed
it
in
the
context
of
the
overall
case
is
the
way
i--
mr.
carl
hughes
--i
don't
think
i
can
find
it
in
here.
mr.
carl
hughes
yes.
especially
in...
in
any
event,
yes.
and
the
issue
is
even
narrower.
the
issue
is
what
is
presented
by
the
cert
question,
and
the
issue
comes
down
to,
as
i
see
it,
whether
or
not...
whether
we
have
to
prove
the
one
free
bite
theory;
whether
a
single
incident,
taken
together
with
training,
an
independent
proof
of
a
policy
is
sufficient.
mr.
carl
hughes
i
would
say
so.
mr.
carl
hughes
well,
we
saw
it
as
just
a
straight
monell
issue.
policy
plus
causation.
and
that's
the
way
it
was
presented.
mr.
carl
hughes
i
don't
know.
in
any
event,
the
theory
presented
to
the
court
at
this
time
by
the
city
is
that
rotramel
departed
by
city
policy.
the
theory
presented
in
the
trial
court
was
that
rotramel's
actions
were
in
complete
compliance
with
city
policy.
they
have
changed
their
theory
as
they
proceeded
through
the
appellate
level.
the
long
and
short
of
it
is,
the
matter
was
properly
instructed
on
in
our
view,
the
evidence
was
submitted
to
the
jury,
the
jury
resolved
the
factual
issues
against
the
city
of
oklahoma
city,
properly
so.
there
is
just
nothing
before
the
court
at
the
present
time
to
properly
preserve
for
resolution.
mr.
carl
hughes
under
my
theory?
of
course,
under
my
theory,
it's
a
fact
question
as
to
whether
or
not
the
degree
and
nature
of
it,
under
my
theory--
mr.
carl
hughes
--if
they
had
a
policy.
mr.
carl
hughes
under
those
circumstances--
mr.
carl
hughes
--under
our
theory
and
our
reading,
that
would
create
liability.
