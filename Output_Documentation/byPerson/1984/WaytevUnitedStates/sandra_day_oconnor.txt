justice
o'connor
mr.
rosenbaum,
it
sounded
to
me
in
looking
at
the
record
as
though
in
the
court
below
you
had
proceeded
on
a
selective
prosecution
theory,
and
that
up
in
this
court
now
you
are
approaching
the
problem
much
as
you
would
in
attacking
a
statute
which
on
its
face
burdens
first
amendment
rights.
have
you
changed
your
theory
and
your
contentions?
justice
o'connor
have
you
abandoned
then--
justice
o'connor
--the
selective
prosecution
ground?
justice
o'connor
well,
you
don't
want
us
to
address
that,
then?
i
am
a
little
confused
by
your
response.
justice
o'connor
they
can't,
of
course,
raise
an
issue.
it
is
your
petition.
justice
o'connor
well,
on
that
point,
is
it
not
true
that
the
policy
of
the
government
also
incorporated
prosecution
of
those
reported
by
third
parties--
justice
o'connor
--to
be
violated?
justice
o'connor
so
it
isn't
quite
as
you
have
described
it.
justice
o'connor
but
not
necessarily.
for
example,
in
the
eklund
case
it
was
the
parents
of
some
young
man.
justice
o'connor
but
you
concede
that
the
stated
policy
would
have
admitted
that
prosecutions
would
be
based
also
on
third
party
reports.
justice
o'connor
well,
mr.
rosenbaum,
somebody
who
vocally
protests
the
draft
but
registers
is
not
prosecuted,
right?
justice
o'connor
someone
who
vocally
protests
the
draft
but
nevertheless
registers
is
not
prosecuted
under
this
policy.
justice
o'connor
and
so
it
does
appear
as
though
what
the
government
is
doing
is
prosecuting
those
who
don't
register
under
their
policy
of
giving
people
a
chance
to
register
and
not
be
prosecuted.
justice
o'connor
general
lee,
did
the
pool
also
include
those
reported
by
third
parties?
justice
o'connor
does
the
record
tell
us
how
many
people
would
be
included?
