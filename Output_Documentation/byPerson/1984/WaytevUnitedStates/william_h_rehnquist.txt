what
does
that
term
mean
in
the
sense
of
skewed
or
non-typical?
justice
rehnquist
but
you
are
going
to
single
out
by
some
method,
have
some
system
for
prosecution,
so
in
that
sense
any
system
is
"skewed"
in
your
terms,
isn't
it?
justice
rehnquist
mr.
rosenbaum,
what
was
the
occasion
for
your
questioning
mr.
klein?
justice
rehnquist
the
district
court
allowed
you
to
take
a
deposition
like
that?
justice
rehnquist
requested
by
you?
justice
rehnquist
but
isn't
that
a
perfectly
legitimate
position
for
the
government
to
take,
to
say
that
so
far
as
violators
of
the
law
are
concerned,
silence
is
golden,
that
it
is
more
important
for
the
government
as
a
law
enforcement
policy
to
prosecute
violators
who
publicly
proclaim
their
violation
then
violators
who
don't
publicly
proclaim
their
violation?
justice
rehnquist
but
you
know,
there
aren't
a
whole
bunch
of
drug
pusher
that
are
getting
up
and
saying,
i
oppose
the
drug
laws.
it
is
just
in
areas
like
this
that
you
get
people
publicly
proclaiming
their
opposition.
justice
rehnquist
so
you
say
if
the
government
applied
this
policy
in
all
other
areas,
is
there
any
evidence
that
it
doesn't
apply
it
in
other
areas?
justice
rehnquist
well,
you
say
there
is
no
evidence
that
it
is
applied
in
other
areas.
i
asked
you
if
there
is
any
evidence
that
it
isn't
applied
in
other
areas.
justice
rehnquist
in
other
words,
that
there
are
examples
of
other
kinds
of
law
violators
who
get
up
and
publicly
proclaim
they
are
violating
the
law,
and
the
government
nevertheless
does
not
apply
a
passive
policy?
justice
rehnquist
what
areas
are
these?
justice
rehnquist
that
was,
what,
20
years
ago?
i
mean,
i
am
talking
about
present
day
government
policies.
justice
rehnquist
you
say
might,
but
i
thought
you
said
a
minute
ago
that
you
affirmatively
stated
that
the
government
didn't
apply
the
same
policy
in
other
areas.
justice
rehnquist
what
are
other
areas,
mr.
rosenbaum,
in
prosecuting
a
federal
law
violation
other
than
selective
service
where
individuals
do
speak
up?
justice
rehnquist
but
surely
the
government
can
move
one
step
at
a
time,
and
feel
that
its
of
primary
importance
with
a
limited
budget
to
get
the
vocal
people,
and
then
if
they
successfully
prosecute
a
few
of
them,
undoubtedly
there
would
be
other
remedies
brought
to
bear.
justice
rehnquist
well,
surely
the
government
has
a
great
deal
of
discretion.
it
doesn't
have
to
pick
out
the
system
that
will
deter
most
people.
it
probably
can't
even
know
that
in
advance.
justice
rehnquist
what
you
are
saying
then
is
that
the
government
received
a
number
of
letters
complaining,
or
protesting
the
policy
of
the
draft
which
did
not
announce
that
the
writer
was
eligible
for
registration
and
refused
to
register,
and
the
government
did
not
investigate
whether
or
not
there
might
be
liability
for
registration
on
the
part
of
a
writer
who
did
not
state
that
he--
