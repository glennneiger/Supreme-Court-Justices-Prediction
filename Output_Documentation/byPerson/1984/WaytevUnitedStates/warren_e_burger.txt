chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
will
hear
arguments
first
this
morning
in
wayte
against
the
united
states.
mr.
rosenbaum,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
burger
wouldn't
it
be
fair
to
say
that
most
of
the
people
who
fail
to
register
are
opponents
of
the
registration
process?
chief
justice
burger
did
the
government
ever
do
anything
like
that?
chief
justice
burger
did
they
ever
do
anything
like
that?
chief
justice
burger
where
do
we
find
that
in
the
record?
chief
justice
burger
suppose
these
people
who
were
concerned
about...
started
a
campaign
and
said
that
everyone
who
is
opposed
to
this
draft
would
meet
down
at
the
memorial
where
the
vietnam
names
are
listed,
and
we
will
hold
a
demonstration,
and
so
10,000
young
people,
young
men
show
up
there.
and
the
department
of
justice
says,
get
indictments
out
on
500
of
the
people
who
are
in
this
area.
there
might
have
been
some
from
maryland,
and
some
from
virginia,
but
get
out
500
indictments
to
show
that
the
government
can't
be
intimidated,
and
they
put
that
in
a
memorandum.
what
would
your
view
be?
are
they
being
indicted
because
they
exercised
a
first
amendment
right
or
because
they
violated
the
law?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
mr.
solicitor
general.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
have
anything
further,
mr.
rosenbaum?
chief
justice
burger
i
think
you
have
answered
the
question.
i
think
you
have
answered
the
question
now,
mr.
rosenbaum,
but
i
have
one
more.
suppose
the
state
of
virginia
passes
a
statute
that
has
been
proposed
in
many
states
requiring
the
registration
of
all
handguns,
and
quite
a
number
of
people
who
are
active
in
the
nra
and
otherwise
think
that
there
is
a
constitutional
right,
so
they
make
speeches,
and
they
take
activities,
and
they
won't
register
because
they
have
moral
and
constitutional
objections
to
it.
prosecution?
chief
justice
burger
right,
and
a
lot
of
their
neighbors
who
think
handguns
ought
to
be
registered
write
a
letter
to
the
local
prosecutor
and
say,
why
aren't
you
going
after
this
fellow?
chief
justice
burger
and
so
they
indict
him.
chief
justice
burger
how
are
you
going
to
find
out
who
has
a
handgun
in
his
house
that
is
not
registered?
it
is
pretty
difficult,
isn't
it?
you
can't
have
a
general
warrant
to
locate
all
these
handguns
and
then
prosecute
the
people
who
haven't
registered
them.
so
they
go
after
the
people
who
are
identified
by
letters
coming
in
and
other
methods.
do
they
get
immunity
on
your
theory?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you.
thank
you,
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
