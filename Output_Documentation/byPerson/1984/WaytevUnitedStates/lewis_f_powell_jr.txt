justice
jr.
may
i
ask,
of
the
total
pool
i
think
you
mentioned
500,000
or
600,000.
justice
jr.
how
many
of
those
have
been
identified
by
the
government
as
nonregistrants
at
the
time
the
15
suits
were
filed?
justice
jr.
is
my
recollection
incorrect
that
the
government
had
explored
various
ways
of
ascertaining
the
identity
of
a
much
larger
number
of
a
pool?
justice
jr.
is
that
true?
