justice
stevens
mr.
rosenbaum,
can
i
ask
you
a
question
before
i
lose
the...
i
think
it
is
relevant
to
what
you
are
saying.
justice
powell
asked
you
about
the
size
of
the
universe.
you
said
there
were
about
500
or
600
people
that
were
identified
at
the
same
time.
is
that
correct?
justice
stevens
and
what
happened
to
the
other
987?
justice
stevens
you
don't...
it
won't
be
prosecuted.
now,
did
they
apply
that
policy
to
these
13
people?
justice
stevens
so
within
the
group
of
1,000,
was
there
discrimination
against
these
13
because
of
what
they
said?
justice
stevens
they
are
the
ones
who
refused
to
take
advantage
of
the
government's
offer.
justice
stevens
and
would
you
not
say
that
they
were
treated...
they
were
not
discriminated
against
as
contrasted
with
the
other
members
of
this...
if
we
limit
the
universe
for
a
moment
to
1,000
persons,
were
they
treated
differently
than
the
1,000?
justice
stevens
well,
they
are
the
ones
who
refused
to
register.
justice
stevens
it
doesn't
matter
what
words
they
used
in
stating...
they
said,
no,
we
won't
register.
that
is
the
speech
for
which
they
are
being
prosecuted.
justice
stevens
do
you
think
that
they
have
no
right
to
prosecute
somebody
for
saying
i
will
not
register?
justice
stevens
after
they
identify
1,000
people
who...
by
some
public
means
they
cannot
select
the
13
out
of
that
1,000
who
won't
register?
justice
stevens
were
1,000,
not
13.
justice
stevens
their
opposition,
or
their
unwillingness
to
register?
justice
stevens
do
you
know
that
as
to
all
1,000?
justice
stevens
were
there
no
people
called
to
the
attention
of
the
government
by
informers?
justice
stevens
somebody
might
get
up
at
a
meeting
and
say,
i'd
like
everybody
else
to
register,
but
they
are
never
going
to
catch
me.
nobody
like
that
was
ever
reported
to
the
government?
justice
stevens
well,
no,
i
am
saying
he
is
not...
he
is
just
opposed
to
being
registered
himself.
he
might
get
up
and
make
a
speech
and
say,
i
think
the
draft
is
great
for
everybody
else,
but
nobody
can
catch
me
because
they
don't
have
an
enforcement
policy.
justice
stevens
someone
might
be
offended
by
that
and
call
the--
justice
stevens
--do
we
know
about
most
of
these
1,000
people?
that
is
what
i
am
wondering
about.
justice
stevens
the
thing
that
puzzles
me...
i
don't
mean
to
debate
with
you.
the
thing
that
puzzles
me
is
about
90
some
percent
of
this
1,000,
who
were
not
all
that
morally
opposed
to
it,
when
the
chips
were
down,
they
decided
to
sign
up?
justice
stevens
you
are
assuming
that
these
other
900
all
made
precisely
the
same
kind
of
public
speeches
as
the
13,
and
if
that
is
true,
then
they
were
not
indicted
because
of
their
speech,
because
they
were
permitted
to
register,
so
the
speech
really
becomes
irrelevant.
justice
stevens
if
you
assume
they
all
said
the
same
thing
as
the
13.
justice
stevens
--i
thought
there
were
some
in
the
group
who
after
investigation
it
was
determined
they
were
over
age,
or
something
like
that.
justice
stevens
they
might
have
said
it
even
though
they
weren't
required,
is
what
you
are
saying.
justice
stevens
may
i
ask
just
while
you
are
right
on
that
point--
justice
stevens
--general
lee,
the
500
or
so
that
are
third
party
reported,
your
adversaries
say,
well,
they
really
are
not
different,
because
they
were
only
third
party
reported
because
they
were
vocal
in
the
first
instance,
so
they
really
should
be
treated
alike.
justice
stevens
may
i
ask
one
question
here?
justice
stevens
how
could
the
government
cure
its
mistake,
accepting
your
theory
of
the
whole
case?
if
they
were
then
willing
to
adopt
an
active
enforcement
policy
and
indict
700,000
people,
could
they
then
indict
your
clients?
justice
stevens
they
require
everybody
to
register
by
enforcing
the
beg
policy,
they
find
everybody,
and
your
people
still
refuse
to
register.
can
they
then
indict
your
people?
justice
stevens
well,
you
are
not
going
to
persuade
me
on
the
tax
case.
there
are
a
lot
of
different
things
about
that
case.
but
in
this
particular
case,
if
they
make
enough
people
register,
then
they
can
prosecute
your
clients?
is
that
your
point?
justice
stevens
you
would
apply
this...
it
is
not
the
fact
that
it
is
a
draft
case.
you
would
apply
it
if
it
was
smoking
in
the
elevators,
or
bootlegging,
the
same
thing
if
they
had
a
policy
that
we
only
prosecute
people
for
smoking
in
the
elevator
if
it
comes
to
our
attention.
that
is
equally
protected.
justice
stevens
there
are
people
who
feel
very
strongly
about
the
right
to
smoke.

justice
stevens
what
if
he
writes
a
letter
in
exactly
the
same
pattern,
but
it
is
a
different
violation?
