mr.
rex
e.
lee
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
i
want
to
correct
any
misimpression
that
might
exist
as
to
the
facts
of
this
case,
particularly
how
this
program
operated,
some
of
the
problems
that
the
government
raised,
and
how
it
went
about
solving
them.
i
do
so
against
the
background
of
the
well
established
principle
that
the
selection
of
prosecutorial
choices
lies
at
the
heart
of
the
executive
responsibility
to
see
that
the
laws
are
faithfully
executed.
the
issue
in
this
case
is
not
whether
someone
else
can
see
another
way
that
the
government
might
have
gone
about
its
responsibility
to
enforce
the
draft
registration
laws.
basically
there
were
three
options
that
were
available
to
the
government,
and
all
three
were
considered.
the
three
were,
first,
sometimes
called
the
active
method,
was
to
identify
the
entire
universe
of
persons
who
were
required
to
register,
match
those
against
those
who
had
registered,
and
then
make
a
random
selection
out
of
the
difference
between
those
two
groups,
who
would
be
the
nonregistrants,
and
prosecute
those
who
were
randomly
selected.
the
second
option,
which
is
sometimes
referred
to
as
the
passive
method,
was
narrower
in
scope
and
less
expensive,
would
have
been
simply
to
prosecute
those
who
the
government
knew
were
violators
from
information
that
had
been
supplied
either
by
them
or
by
someone
else.
what
the
government
in
fact
elected
was
to
develop
an
active
system,
knew
that
it
would
take
some
time
to
develop
the
active
system.
in
fact,
it
took
longer
than
the
government
anticipated
it
would
take
to
develop
it,
with
a
passive
program
in
effect
during
the
interim
while
the
active
method
was
being
developed.
mr.
rosenbaum
is
just
quite
wrong
when
he
says
that
the
active
system,
that
there
was
undue
delay
in
developing
it.
as
set
forth
at
page
7
of
our
brief,
there
was
a
computer
program
that
had
been
developed
and
was
ready
to
go
as
early
as
march
of
1982.
one
of
the
petitioner's
main
errors,
i
submit,
is
his
assertion
that
during
this
passive
phase
interim,
the
event
which
triggered
further
prosecution
was
criticism
or
dissent.
the
uncontradicted
evidence
in
this
record,
which
is
discussed
at
page
13
of
our
brief,
shows
that
in
fact
the
trigger
was
evidence
of
nonregistration.
no
matter
how
vehement
the
letter
of
protest,
no
matter
how
many
speeches
the
individual
gave,
that
activity
would
result
in
further
investigation
only
if
it
included
the
one
thing,
the
only
thing
that
the
government
was
looking
for,
and
that
was
some
evidence
of
the
sole
piece
of
information
which
the
government
was
interested
in.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
precisely.
that
kind
of
person
did
not
become
one
of
the
1,000
who
was
investigated
further.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
yes,
that
is
correct,
but
in
the
initial
letter,
they
might
have
said,
i
am
not
going
to
register
for
the
draft,
and
that
would
put
them
into
the
pool
of
1,000,
but
it
is
true
that--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--that
is
correct.
that
is
correct.
the
way
it
worked
was
that
the--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--it
did,
justice
o'connor.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
yes,
it
does,
and
that's
about
the
only
thing
that
the
record
tells
us
about
those
1,000
people,
is
that
a
little
over
half
of
them
were
third
party
reported.
and
it
also
tells
us,
of
course,
how
they
got
on
that
list,
and
as
i
say,
it
was
only
if
there
was
some
evidence
of
the
only
piece
of
information
that
the
government
was
looking
for,
which
was
evidence
of
nonregistration
by
a
male
of
draft
age.
now,
once
we
had
that
information,
that
put
them
into
the
pool,
and
eventually
that
pool
was
in
excess
of
1,000
people,
and
it
was
kept
by
selective
service.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
yes.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
that
would
shed
any
light
on
that
one
way
or
the
other.
now,
once
selective
service
got
its
pool
of
names,
the
first
thing
that
selective
service
did
was
to
send
one
of
these
registration
in
lieu
of
prosecution
letters,
and
from
that
initial
screening
process
the
number
was
narrowed
down
to
about
133.
those
were
then
sent
to
the
department
of
justice,
and
the
u.s.
attorney
would
send
at
least
one
letter
advising
once
again
of
the
registration
in
lieu
of
prosecution
alternative,
and
then
in
most
cases,
including
the
petitioner
wayte,
there
was
also
a
visit
from
an
fbi
agent
advising
him
finally
of
this
so-called
beg
policy.
now,
it
is
not
surprising
under
these
circumstances
that
the
only
person
who
would
be
prosecuted
as
a
result
of
this
process
would
be
protesters,
but
the
only
reason
that
it
is
not
surprising
is
because
the
government
went
the
extra
mile
to
attempt
to
implement
what
has
been
its
policy
throughout,
as
we
argued
last
april
in
the
selective
service
case,
and
that
is
not
to
put
people
in
jail,
but
to
get
them
registered.
it
would
be
the
ultimate
irony
if
the
fact
that
we
were
willing
to
go
that
extra
mile
to
get
people
registered
instead
of
put
in
jail
would
result
in
the
entire
process
being
held
unconstitutional,
and
yet
that
is
the
only
argument
that
the
petitioner
has,
is
this
kind
of
ultimate
effects
test.
i
submit
that
the
key
to
decision
in
this
case
is
to
make
a
clean
distinction
between
two
separate
activities,
criticism
of
the
draft
and
registration
for
the
draft.
criticism
is
constitutionally
protected
and
any
governmental
impingement
on
it
can
be
sustained
only
if
it
satisfies
the
requirements
that
this
court
has
identified.
nonregistration,
by
contrast,
enjoys
no
constitutional
protection.
governmental
burdens
on
a
person's
desire
not
to
register
are
irrelevant
to
the
first
amendment.
no
one
in
this
courtroom
disputes
that
david
wayte
has
violated
the
law.
he
is
legally
obligated
to
register
for
the
draft,
and
in
refusing
to
do
so
he
has
committed
a
crime.
so
that
the
only
question
is
whether
there
is
something
about
the
fact
that
the
government
has
prosecuted
only
him
and
a
few
others
like
him,
but
not
all,
that
precludes
the
government
from
calling
this
petitioner
to
account
for
his
acknowledged
violation.
now,
i
must
confess
that
i
am
confused
concerning
just
what
the
petitioner's
position
is
with
respect
to
selective
prosecution.
it
is
not
one
of
the
questions
presented.
i
do
not
find
it
argued
in
the
brief.
nevertheless,
in
our
view,
it
is
the
only
legitimate
constitutional
question
that
is
before
the
court.
we
think
this
is
not
a
legitimate
first
amendment
issue.
i
will
discuss
briefly
first
the
selective
prosecution
issue,
and
then
the
first
amendment
issue.
building
on
this
court's
statements
in
cyler
versus
boles
and
other
cases,
the
courts
of
appeals
have
adopted
a
two-part
test
with
which,
so
far
as
i
can
determine,
no
court
disagrees.
it
has
never
been
formally
adopted
by
this
court.
we
would
urge
its
adoption
by
this
court.
we
think
it
represents
just
the
right
balance
between,
on
the
one
hard,
wide
room
for
the
exercise
of
prosecutorial
discretion
that
this
court
has
frequently
said
the
government
must
have,
and
on
the
other
hand,
preserving
the
opportunity
for
a
legitimate
showing
of
improper
selection
in
a
particular
case.
it
is
a
two-part
test.
first,
the
defendant
must
show
that
he
was
chosen
for
prosecution,
although
others
similarly
situated
were
not,
and
second,
he
must
show
that
the
prosecutor
intentionally
discriminated
against
him
on
the
basis
of
some
impermissible
consideration
such
as
race,
religion,
or
the
exercise
of
a
constitutional
right.
it
is
that
second
prong
of
the
selective
prosecution
test
that
gives
adequate
opportunity,
adequate
protection
for
the
exercise
of
first
amendment
rights.
briefly,
with
respect
to
the
first
prong,
petitioner
simply
has
not
shown
that
others
similarly
situated
have
not
been
prosecuted.
this
case
is
different
insofar
as
similarly
situated
is
concerned.
justice
rehnquist
asked
the
question,
have
there
been
other
circumstances
where
people
have
announced
their
protest
and
then
been
prosecuted,
and
the
answer
is
yes,
there
have.
tax
protester
cases
are
such
cases.
the
air
traffic
control
strike
cases
were
such
cases.
we
have
universally
won
those
cases
in
the
lower
courts
except
where
the
government's
conduct
has
been
found
to
violate
the
rather
broad
discretionary
standards
that
are
given
by
this
test.
but
this
case
is
different.
this
is
simply
not
a
hard
selective
prosecution
case.
and
the
reason
this
case
is
different
from
the
tax
protester
case
and
the
air
traffic
controller
case
is
in
both
of
which
contexts
our
conduct
has
been
upheld
because
of
the
fact
that
we
get
the
most,
if
you
will,
bang
for
the
buck
out
of
prosecuting
the
most
vocal
protesters,
is
that
in
this
instance
we
prosecuted
everyone
similarly
situated.
now,
in
the
nature
of
things,
we
cannot
prosecute
those
who
we
do
not
know
have
violated
the
law.
and
at
the
end
of
this
screening
process,
there
were
only
eventually
17
people,
13
as
of
the
time
of
the
trial
in
this
case,
whom
we
knew
had
violated
the
law,
and
we
prosecuted
every
one
of
them.
there
was
absolutely
no
discrimination.
with
regard
to
the
second
prong,
i
simply
submit
that
there
was
no
violation,
that
the
court
of
appeals
finding
is
correct,
and
in
any
event,
that
there
has
not
been
any
violation
of
the
first
amendment
of
any
kind,
and
it
is
to
that
issue
that
i
now
turn.
the
petitioner's
contention
that
his
prosecution
violates
the
first
amendment
depends
totally
on
the
significance
that
he
ascribes
to
the
fact
that
all
of
the
men
who
have
been
prosecuted
had
one
thing
in
common.
they
had
all
expressed
opposition
to
the
draft.
in
fact,
however,
those
who
were
prosecuted
also
have
a
second
thing
in
common,
and
that
is
as
to
each
of
them
we
knew
who
they
were.
two
facts,
both
uncontroverted,
make
it
very
clear
that
it
was
the
second
of
these
common
denominators
and
not
the
first
that
constituted,
to
use
the
petitioner's
term,
the
trip
wire
for
prosecution.
the
first
is
that
during
the
passive
phase
interim,
which
incidentally
lasted
about
15
months,
the
event
which
placed
a
young
man
on
the
list
for
further
investigation
was
his
criticism.
no
matter
how
vehement
the
protest,
no
matter
how
extensive
the
protest,
it
was
only
if
he
included
that
one
magic
sentence
that
got
him
initially
into
the
pool
of
somewhat
over
1,000.
and
the
second
fact
is
that
he
could
quickly
get
himself
off
that
list
by
his
own
selection.
this
was
not,
if
you
will,
selective
prosecution.
this
was
elective
prosecution.
the
so-called
beg
policy
is
relevant
not
only
because
it
sheds
light
on
the
government's
objective.
it
also
draws
the
clean
distinction
between
the
two
factors
that
must
be
distinguished
in
this
case,
registration
on
the
one
hand
and
protest
on
the
other.
regardless
of
what
the
individual
might
have
done
in
the
past,
he
is
free
both
to
register
for
the
draft,
as
everyone
concedes
he
is
legally
obligated
to
do,
and
also
continue
to
protest,
so
long
as
he
registers.
late
registrants
who
spoke
against
the
draft
were
not
prosecuted,
and
prosecutions
were
brought
against
every
identified
nonregistrant
who
refused
to
comply.
just
one
final
point.
even
if
this
were
a
first
amendment
case,
even
if
you
could
get
by
the
first
amendment
threshold,
in
this
instance,
there
is
no
suppression
of
speech,
incidental
or
otherwise.
for
reasons
discussed
in
our
brief,
we
believe
that
the
relevant
first
amendment
inquiry
is
stated
by
this
court
in
united
states
versus
o'brien
16
years
ago,
and
reaffirmed
twice
just
last
term
in
the
jaycees
case
and
in
the
ccnv
sleeping
in
the
park
case,
that
incidental
restraints
on
first
amendment
interests
are
permissible
so
long
as
what
government
is
attempting
to
do
is,
and
i
am
quoting
from
both
roberts
and
the
sleeping
in
the
park
case,
"unrelated
to
the
suppression
of
expression.
"
in
this
case,
there
is
no
suppression
speech,
incidental
or
otherwise,
and
the
reason
is
that
these
two
activities,
registration
and
protest,
can
exist
side
by
side,
contrasted
in
that
respect
with
the
jaycees
case.
the
attainment
of
minnesota's
antidiscrimination
objective
as
expressed
in
its
statute
necessarily
affected
the
associational
interests
of
the
jaycees.
either
minnesota's
interest
in
combatting
discrimination
or
the
jaycees'
associational
interest
had
to
yield,
and
that
is
what
brings
about
a
first
amendment
problem,
when
one
of
them
necessarily
has
to
yield
to
the
other.
the
same
was
true
in
sleeping
in
the
park.
the
same
was
true
in
o'brien.
and
i
submit
that
the
same
is
true
in
every
other
legitimate
first
amendment
case.
the
feature
of
true
first
amendment
cases
that
brings
the
first
amendment
into
play
is
the
fact
that
the
very
act
of
accomplishing
the
governmental
objective
necessarily
affects
first
amendment
activity.
but
here,
so
long
as
the
protester
complies
with
the
legal
duty
which
even
he
does
not
dispute,
he
is
free
to
criticize,
and
even
if
he
does
not
register,
he
is
free
to
criticize.
he
will
be
prosecuted,
but
it
will
not
be
for
not
registering,
because
it
did
not
depend
on
the
substance
of
anything
that
was
said
other
than
the
reporting
of
a
violation.
so
that
the
only
incremental
risk,
the
only
component
of
his
speech
that
puts
him
at
all
at
risk
is
that
single
component
of
his
speech
that
identifies
commission
of
a
crime,
and
there
is
nothing
in
the
first
amendment,
nothing
in
the
fifth
amendment,
and
nothing
in
the
constitution
that
protects
against
the
government's
use
of
that
information.
unless
the
court
has
further
questions,
i
have
nothing
else.
