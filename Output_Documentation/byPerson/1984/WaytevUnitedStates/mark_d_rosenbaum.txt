mr.
mark
d.
rosenbaum
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
a
system
of
justice
must
of
course
take
advantage
of
confessions
and
eye
witness
reports
of
criminal
activity.
we
do
not
attack
that
proposition,
nor
do
we
seek
immunity
for
offenders
regardless
of
how
identified.
rather,
this
case
presents
the
issue
whether
the
government
violates
the
first
amendment
by
a
policy
of
enforcing
the
draft
registration
law
in
a
way
that
inherently
results
in
investigating
and
prosecuting
only
those
who
proclaim
their
noncompliance
with
registration,
a
group
that
would
inevitably
be
limited
to
political
opponents
of
draft
registration.
what
is
undisputed
here
may
be
briefly
stated.
of
the
700,000
who
violated
the
registration
law,
as
both
courts
below
found,
only
13,
all
of
them
political
or
religious
protestors
against
selective
service,
were
investigated
or
prosecuted.
mr.
mark
d.
rosenbaum
chief
justice
burger,
there
were
hearings
before
a
congressional
committee
as
to
the
causes
of
individuals
who
did
not
register.
those
hearings
before
a
senate
subcommittee
elicited
a
variety
of
reasons,
only
one
of
which
was
religious
or
political
objection
to
the
registration.
in
fact,
as
we
indicated
in
our
papers,
persons
felt
that
the
president
wasn't
serious
about
draft
registration,
persons
were
upset
that
their
peers
had
been
not
prosecuted.
six
separate
reasons
were
listed.
political
and
moral
objection
was
only
one
of
them.
so,
it
was
not
mere
statistical
happenstance
that
the
only
individuals
in
fact
prosecuted
were
political
or
religious
objectors.
from
the
inception
of
the
government's
policy,
the
justice
department
recognized
that
investigating
and
prosecuting
only
those
who
proclaimed
their
noncompliance
would
result
in
a
skewed
sample
of
nonregistrants,
what
the
government
itself
termed
a
not
typical
sample.
the
department
recognized--
mr.
mark
d.
rosenbaum
--it
meant
that
out
of
an
entire
pool
of
nonregistrants,
individuals
who
had
a
variety
of
reasons
for
not
registering,
the
only
individuals
who
in
fact
would
be
selected,
would
be
singled
out,
would
be
those
who
had
actively
protested,
either
by
writing
the
president
of
the
united
states
or
by
speaking
out
against
the
draft
itself.
mr.
mark
d.
rosenbaum
any
system
singles
out
certain
individuals
for
investigation
and
prosecution.
the
critical
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
the
government
can
rely
upon
a
policy
which
if
activated
only
through
the
exercise
of
political
petition
or
speech.
mr.
mark
d.
rosenbaum
yes,
sir.
mr.
mark
d.
rosenbaum
that
is
an
interesting
question
that
goes
to
the
nature
of
the
government's
enforcement
policy.
in
fact,
only
in
the
neighborhood
of
some
500
or
600
individuals
had
been
identified
by
the
government's
policy,
but
that
wasn't
because
the
government
had
sought
a
variety
of
methods
to
identify
individuals,
and
happened
only
as
a
matter
of
chance
to
elect
to
find
the
individuals
who
had
spoken
out
or
who
had
written
the
president.
the
very
premise
of
the
government's
enforcement
policy
was
that
it
was
not
interested,
that
it
showed
no
concern
whatsoever
for
nonregistrants
who
had
violated
the
law
in
any
other
way.
it
was
as
if
the
law
that
the
government
was
enforcing
was
a
law
that
made
it
a
crime
to
not
register
when
accompanied
by
protest
or
speech,
not
the
offense
itself.
mr.
mark
d.
rosenbaum
let
me
answer
that
in
two
respects,
justice--
mr.
mark
d.
rosenbaum
--it
is
not
true
that
the
government
at
the
time
that
these
individuals
had
been
prosecuted
had
in
fact
made
a
determination
to
investigate
or
prosecute
by
any
other
system
than
the
passive
enforcement
system.
for
first
amendment
purposes,
whether
in
fact
they
had
intended
another
enforcement
policy
is
irrelevant.
the
cases
from
this
court
from
the
very
beginning
of
analysis
of
the
first
amendment
have
consistently
held
that
a
first
amendment
violation
exists
by
virtue
of
whether
or
not
there
is
an
impact
on
the
first
amendment.
that
the
government
might
have
had
good
intentions,
might
some
day
have
wanted
to
investigate
other
individuals
has
no
bearing
as
to
whether
or
not
a
first
amendment
offense
had
in
fact
been
committed.
but
the
fact
of
the
case
is,
as
the
district
court
found,
and
it
was
not
reversed
by
the
ninth
circuit,
that
the
government
itself
had
not
pursued
available
alternative
methods,
that
in
february
of
1982,
the
government
in
a
volume
called
increasing
selective
service
compliance,
had
examined
other
alternatives
besides
the
passive
enforcement
system,
had
found
them
viable,
reasonable.
the
only
costs
it
had
been
concerned
about
were
political
costs.
in
march
of
1982,
eight
months
after
the
government
states
to
this
court
that
it
was
interested
in
another
policy,
a
memo
was
drafted
from
the
assistant
attorney
general
of
the
criminal
division
to
his
counterpart
in
the
selective
service
department
which
said,
the
purpose
of
this
memo
is
to
explore
whether
or
not
we
shall
address,
whether
or
not
we
shall
establish
an
active
enforcement
system.
that
is
at
page
294
of
the
memo.
and
when
i
questioned
david
klein,
the
justice
department
official
who
had
authored
that
memo,
i
said
to
mr.
klein,
why
did
you
write
it
in
march,
'82,
eight
months
after
you
say
that
the
government
was
intent
upon
a
system?
and
mr.
klein's
response,
at
798
and
at
803
of
the
record,
was
that
he
wanted
to
push
the
decisionmakers,
he
wanted
to
push
selective
service
to
the
maximum
extent
possible
to
establish
an
active
enforcement
system.
mr.
mark
d.
rosenbaum
it
was
in
the
course
of
a
hearing
before
the
district
court
on
the
question
of
the
propriety
of
the
prosecution
system
which
the
government
had
employed.
mr.
mark
d.
rosenbaum
it
was
in
open
hearing.
it
was
an
evidentiary
hearing
in
the
course
of
pretrial--
mr.
mark
d.
rosenbaum
--requested
by
us,
but
we
made
a
prima
facie
showing
which
the
district
court
found
that
individuals
had
been
singled
out
by
virtue
of
their
expression
of
political
rights.
mr.
mark
d.
rosenbaum
no.
justice
o'connor,
it
is
true,
as
you
point
out,
that
the
basis
of
the
argument
that
i
am
principally
making
to
the
court
this
morning
is
as
if
there
was
a
statute
that
established
this
enforcement
system,
because
in
fact--
mr.
mark
d.
rosenbaum
--no.
mr.
mark
d.
rosenbaum
we
have
not
abandoned
the
argument
that
there
was
intentional
discrimination,
that
judge
hatter
found
that
intentional
discrimination,
and
that
the
ninth
circuit
was
incorrect
in
reversing.
the
ninth
circuit
did
not
state
that
in
fact
there
wasn't
that
intent
present.
all
the
ninth
circuit
said
was,
there
are
other
justifications
that
exist,
stated
that
the
clearly
erroneous
standard
ought
to
be
applied,
but
never
indicated
why
upon
an
analysis
of
the
clearly
erroneous
standard
somehow
intent
would
not
be
there.
but
it
is
actually
the
government
that
has
shifted
its
argument
in
this
court.
at
the
ninth
circuit
level
and
at
the
district
court
level,
it
was
conceded
by
the
government
that
what
was
implicated
in
this
case
were
first
amendment
rights,
and
it
is
only
the
government
for
the
first
time
arguing
before
this
court
that
first
amendment
rights
are
not
involved
in
this
case.
and
of
course
the
nature
of
the
policy
itself
is
one
that
the
government
has
recognized.
mr.
mark
d.
rosenbaum
i
am
stating
to
the
court--
mr.
mark
d.
rosenbaum
--no.
and
we
continue
to
rely
upon
the
district
court's
findings,
and
state
that
that
is
an
independent
ground
for
which
the
district
court's
decision
could
be
sustained.
but
the
point
is
in
this
particular
matter
that
even
if
there
hadn't
been
a
finding
of
intent,
the
government
policy
here,
which
you
correctly
state
is
tantamount
to
a
statute,
a
statute
that
would
say
that
those
who
speak
out
will
be
prosecuted--
mr.
mark
d.
rosenbaum
--yes.
mr.
mark
d.
rosenbaum
yes,
and--
mr.
mark
d.
rosenbaum
--no,
justice
o'connor,
the
government's
argument
that
the
third
policy
reporting
provision
doesn't
save
the
first
amendment
matter
in
this
case
for
the
government.
the
government
argues,
for
example,
that
because
there
were
these
third
party
reports,
there
was
the
possibility,
the
possibility
that
individuals
could
be
identified
who
were
not
involved
in
exercise
of
speech.
but
the
government
itself
recognized
in
a
variety
of
memoranda
in
this
record
that
those
who
would
be
identified
by
third
party
reportings
would
be
the
vocal
proponents
of
nonregistration.
that's
the
government's
words.
and
they
didn't
have
to
call
in
a
social
behaviorist
to
find
that
out.
mr.
mark
d.
rosenbaum
yes,
but
the
high
probability
which
the
government
recognized
was
in
fact
the
case.
consider
the
nature
of
this
case.
consider
the
way
a
third
party
might
report...
might
report
a
violation
of
the
registration
law.
this
is
not
a
crime
that
admits
of
eye
witnesses.
jimmy
stewart
could
stare
out
his
rear
window
forever
and
he
would
never
sight
a
young
man
in
the
act
of
not
registering.
nor
is
this
the
sort
of
crime
that
an
individual
over
a
backyard
fence
would
discuss.
an
individual
is
not
going
to
come
up
and
say,
good
morning,
how
are
you,
nice
day
to
day,
how
are
the
redskins
doing,
by
the
way,
i
am
still
not
registered,
what
are
you
going
to
have
for
dinner
tomorrow?
there
is
not
a
single
piece
of
evidence
in
this
record,
either
in
the
course
of
the
trial
itself
or
in
the
hearings
which
the
government
cites
that
indicates
that
this
individual
was
anything
but
hypothetical,
the
individual
who
would
be
reporting
outside
protected
speech.
mr.
mark
d.
rosenbaum
i
would
concede
that
only
if
we
regard
this
case
in
a
most
abstract
sense,
and
not
look
in
the
real
world,
as
the
government
itself
understood,
how
in
fact
it
would
be
enforced,
that
the
possibility
of
a
significant
number
of
individuals
reported
by
methods
not
related
to
use
of
speech,
exercise
of
speech,
could
be
involved.
and,
justice
o'connor,
in
your
decision
in
the
minneapolis
case,
minneapolis
star
and
tribune,
the
ink
and
paper
tax
case,
the
court
there
stated
that
a
special
tax
that
singled
out
the
newspaper
for
a
unique
burden,
a
unique
disadvantage,
would
be
unconstitutional
because
of
the
special
disfavor
that
it
placed
the
first
amendment.
now,
imagine
in
that
case
if
minnesota
responded
to
that
decision
and
said,
we
will
enlarge
the
ink
and
paper
tax
to
include
a
paper
tax
on
small
butcher
shops.
that
mere
patch-on
of
an
insignificant
number
of
individuals
certainly
couldn't
rescue
the
statutory
system
that
was
implicated
there
in
terms
of
its
unique
disfavor
to
the
first
amendment.
mr.
mark
d.
rosenbaum
i
believe
the
first
group
was
around
130,
and
by
the
time
the
matter
was
completed,
it
may
have
been
somewhere
in
the
neighborhood
of
900
or
1,000.
mr.
mark
d.
rosenbaum
the
government
had
a
policy
which
is
colloquially
referred
to
as
the
beg
policy,
in
which
the
government
would
say
to
an
individual,
we
have
information
that
you
are
not
registered.
you
have
a
duty
to
register.
if
you
don't
register
within
three
weeks,
you
will
be
prosecuted.
mr.
mark
d.
rosenbaum
yes,
they
did.
mr.
mark
d.
rosenbaum
it
is
true
that
the
individuals
who
were
singled
out
for
the
actual
prosecution
were
those
that
were
most
adamant,
and
that
it
was
the
use
of
that
speech--
mr.
mark
d.
rosenbaum
--that's
correct,
but
the
beg
system
in
addition--
mr.
mark
d.
rosenbaum
--well,
in
the
sense,
justice
stevens,
that
the
actual
prosecutions
were
limited
to
persons
who
in
fact
stated
their
dissent
most
vigorously.
that
was
the
only
individuals
that
would
be--
mr.
mark
d.
rosenbaum
--that's
correct.
mr.
mark
d.
rosenbaum
that's
correct.
i
want
to
make
another
point.
mr.
mark
d.
rosenbaum
no,
i
think
the
government
has
an
absolute
right
to
prosecute
an
individual
who
says
i
will
not
register,
or
that...
admits
a
confession
of
any
kind.
mr.
mark
d.
rosenbaum
no,
no
objection
to
prosecuting
individuals
as
an
abstract
matter
who
say
that
they
will
not
register.
the
concern
here
is
that
the
only
individuals
that
the
enforcement
policy
was
activated
against--
mr.
mark
d.
rosenbaum
--yes,
but
that
1,000
was
a
sample
of
individuals
who
had
either
written
the
president
their
opposition
or
who
had
expressed
publicly
their
opposition.
mr.
mark
d.
rosenbaum
their
opposition,
justice
stevens.
mr.
mark
d.
rosenbaum
i
know
that
the
government
itself
recognized
from
the
outset
that
the
individuals
who
would
be
singled
out
for
the
application
of
the
beg
policy,
that
is,
the
individuals
who
would
be
investigated
and
prosecuted,
would
be
individuals
who
were
protesting,
not
registrants.
as
recently
as
the
brief
filed
by--
mr.
mark
d.
rosenbaum
--there
is
no--
mr.
mark
d.
rosenbaum
--if
an
individual
had
been
reported
in
that
method,
then
that
individual
would
have
been
reported
as
a
result
of
making
a
public
statement
expressing
a
particular
opposition.
mr.
mark
d.
rosenbaum
no.
mr.
mark
d.
rosenbaum
no
example
of
that
in
the
record.
in
fact,
the
record
is
to
the
contrary.
mr.
mark
d.
rosenbaum
we
know
that
the
government
understood
from
the
outset
that
these
would
be
the
individuals
who
would
be
either
writing
the
president
or
who
would
be
speaking
out
and
would
be
making
religious
or
moral
objection.
we
also
know
another
thing,
and
that
is--
mr.
mark
d.
rosenbaum
--well,
the
fact
that
they
may
have
changed
their
mind
when
the
chips
were
down,
the
fact
that
these
were
the
most
fervent
believers,
the
most
fervent
dissenters,
doesn't
mean
that
the
remainder
of
that
1,000
had
not
also
expressed
their
dissent.
it
indicates
just
as
you
state,
justice
stevens,
that
when
the
crunch
actually
came,
and
when
they
were
asked
whether
or
not
they
wanted
to
be
prosecuted,
that
they
said
that
they
would
rather
register
at
that
point
in
time,
but
that
doesn't
mean--
mr.
mark
d.
rosenbaum
--no.
mr.
mark
d.
rosenbaum
what
we
are
concerned
about,
justice
stevens,
is
an
enforcement
system.
the
fact
is
that
the
big
policy
that
we
are
discussing
right
now
was
not
applied
to
any
other
individual
who
had
not
exercised
speech.
the
government
says,
these
individuals
were
like
civil
contemners.
they
had
a
key
to
the
jail
that
they
could
always
unlock.
but
the
point
of
this
case,
the
constitutional
vice
is
that
we
have
a
speech-activated,
content-based
enforcement
system
for
which
nonprotesting
nonregistrants
never
had
any
doors
to
unlock.
what
the
government
said
by
virtue
of
this
enforcement
policy,
more
than
a
prosecutor
policy,
but
an
enforcement
policy,
was
to
give
what
had
to
be
understood
as
a
guarantee,
that
silence
would
be
golden,
that
failure
to
register
would
not
be
of
concern
to
this
government,
that
individuals
would
not
be
brought
into
the
sweep
of
either
the
beg
policy
or
the--
mr.
mark
d.
rosenbaum
--if
this
were
a
reasonable
enforcement
system,
indeed,
if
this
were
an
enforcement
system
as
for
every
other
law
in
the
united
states
that
i
am
aware
of,
your
argument
would
be
correct,
justice
rehnquist.
mr.
mark
d.
rosenbaum
yes,
and
that
is
precisely
the
point.
mr.
mark
d.
rosenbaum
yes,
there's
absolutely
no
evidence
that
it
is
applied
in
other
areas,
but
the--
mr.
mark
d.
rosenbaum
--i
would
affirmatively
state
that
it
is
not
applied
in
any
other
area,
and
the--
mr.
mark
d.
rosenbaum
--yes.
absolutely
not,
justice
rehnquist.
mr.
mark
d.
rosenbaum
there
are
a
variety
of
areas
for
individuals
such
as
the
o'brien
statute.
mr.
mark
d.
rosenbaum
there
would
be
other
areas
where
an
individual
might
state
a
difference,
but--
mr.
mark
d.
rosenbaum
--the
difference...
it
does
not...
the
government
applies
in
no
other
area,
justice
rehnquist,
in
the
way
of
answering
your
question,
an
enforcement
policy
that
absolutely
doesn't
apply
to
individuals
that
don't
speak
up.
the
crux
of
your
statement--
mr.
mark
d.
rosenbaum
--well,
there
may
be...
in
a
census
statute.
there
may
be
a
variety
of
other
areas
where
individuals
can
express
political
dissent,
but
it
is
that
difference
that
is
really
the
first
amendment
issue
here.
that
is,
what
was
implicit
in
the
deterrent
statement
that
you
indicate.
that
is,
it
makes
sense
to
prosecute
a
visible
individual
because
of
the
message
to
other
individuals.
certainly
isn't
that
an
appropriate
government
selection
process.
that
only
makes
sense
if
in
fact
all
other
individuals
know
that
there
is
a
possibility
that
they
may
be
investigated
or
prosecuted.
in
this
case,
what
was
deterred
was
not
noncompliance,
but
in
fact
what
was
invited
was
a
quiet
breaking
of
the
law.
as
i
indicated
to
chief
justice
burger,
the
government
itself
acknowledged
that
though
there
were
religious
and
political
objectors,
there
were
also
a
variety
of
other
reasons.
mr.
mark
d.
rosenbaum
no,
i
would
disagree
with
you,
justice
rehnquist.
in
the
area
of
the
first
amendment,
where
the
palpable
result,
the
predicted,
inevitable,
inherent
result
is
a
violation
of
the
special
burdening
of
first
amendment
rights,
the
government
cannot
go
one
step
at
a
time.
the
government
may
not
single
out
those
protesters.
moreover,
if
we
apply...
determine
whether
or
not
there
is
a
close
fit,
whether
or
not
in
fact
what
you
indicate
is
true,
which
is,
people
will
see
the
vocal
prosecutor,
vocal
persons
being
prosecuted.
they
will
then
come
into
line.
the
issue
before
the
court
is
whether
this
deterrent
system
will
result
in
more
deterrence
than
any
other
system.
obviously,
if
an
individual
is
prosecuted,
any
individual,
for
any
reason,
there
is
going
to
be
some
deterrent
effect,
but
where
the
government
is
moving--
mr.
mark
d.
rosenbaum
--the
government
can
pick
out
any
system
it
chooses,
as
long
as
it
does
not
select
a
content-based,
speech-activated
system
that
only
singles
out
for
investigation
and
prosecution
individuals
who
state
their
protests
to
the
government,
and
a
system
which
says
to
everyone
else,
if
you
are
silent,
if
you
do
not
exercise
your
first
amendment
rights,
you
will
be
absolutely
guaranteed
that
you
will
not
be
investigated
or
prosecuted.
mr.
mark
d.
rosenbaum
excuse
me?
mr.
mark
d.
rosenbaum
that
is
precisely
what
the
government
has
done
in
this
particular
case.
the
government
has
said--
mr.
mark
d.
rosenbaum
--the
government
acknowledged
in
the
record
that
the
only
individuals
that
in
fact
would
be
selected
would
be,
to
use
the
government's
words,
individuals
who
were
vocal
proponents
of
nonregistration--
mr.
mark
d.
rosenbaum
--first,
the
intent
of
the
government
is
not
what
is
critical.
it
is
the
effect
on
the
first
amendment
rights.
if
the
issue,
and
if
in
the
hypothetical
that
you
are
giving
the
individuals
are
being
singled
out
not
because
of
their
speech,
that
is,
there
is
not
a
brandenburg
type
problem,
but
they
are
being
singled
out
because
they
are
visible,
the
government
wants
to
make
an
example.
that
is
an
appropriate
exercise
of
prosecutorial
discretion,
but
only
if
there
is
a
general
deterrent
policy
that
says
to
all
other
individuals,
those
that
don't
go
down
to
the
memorial,
you
may
be
prosecuted,
too.
where
the
message
is,
if
you
go
down
to
the
memorial
you
will
be
prosecuted,
if
you
do
not,
you
will
not
be
investigated
or
prosecuted,
that
is
an
impermissible
violation
on
the
first
amendment.
that
is
a
violation
that
says
that
if
you
are
silent,
if
you
just
break
the
law
but
are
quiet
about
it,
you
will
not
be
prosecuted,
and
that
is
peculiarly
a
content-based,
speech-activated
system
that
would
be
impermissible
under
the
first
amendment.
mr.
mark
d.
rosenbaum
excuse
me?
mr.
mark
d.
rosenbaum
yes,
but
the
issue
in
the
case
is
not--
mr.
mark
d.
rosenbaum
--the
issue
in
this
case
is
not
whether
registrants
are
permitted
to
speak
out.
obviously,
registrants
can
speak
out.
the
constitutional
vice
here
is
that
among
the
pool,
among
the
body
of
nonregistrants,
those
individuals
who
are
not
registering,
whether
or
not
the
government
can
use
an
enforcement
system
that
singles
out
for
prosecution
only
those
that
exercise
their
petition
and
speech.
the
fact
that
there
may
be
700,000
people
out
there
who
register
and
then
speak
out
against
the
draft
is
not
the
concern.
it
is
whether
or
not
it
can
establish
a
first
amendment
trip
wire
so
that
everyone
else
who
doesn't
exercise
that
speech
in
fact
knows
that
they
will
be
guaranteed
from
prosecution.
if
the
court
has
no
further
questions,
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
mark
d.
rosenbaum
i
do,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
want
to
join
issue
with
general
lee
in
the
sense
that
what
is
in
fact
involved
in
this
case
is
the
relationship
between
criticism
and
the
registration
act
itself
with
respect
to
the
individuals
that
were
singled
out
by
this
system.
if
this
court
finds
that
there
is
no
relationship
that
exists
there,
that
in
fact
all
the
individuals
who
were
singled
out
for
investigation
or
prosecution
or
the
majority
of
them
were
individuals
who
were
not
at
the
same
time
expressing
a
political
opposition
to
the
draft
registration
and
in
fact
expressing
it
not
only
through
stating
their
objection
but
through
the
additional
statement
of
saying
that
they
were
not
registered.
what
general
lee
is
indicating
in
his
statement
is
that
that
statement
itself,
that
i
will
not
register,
is
both
not
protected
by
the
first
amendment
and
additionally
that
it
adds
nothing,
either
in
a
cognitive
sense
or
in
an
emotive
sense,
to
the
message
that
is
being
communicated.
it
is
as
if
the
government
wants
to
extract
that
statement
out
and
tell
david
wayte,
you
may
say
to
the
government,
you
may
say
to
the
government,
i
oppose
this
system
in
an
abstract
sort
of
way,
but
if
you
go
a
step
further,
and
if
you
want
to
communicate
the
additional
intimate
personal
message
that
i
believe
in
that
so
strongly
that
i
will
not
register,
i
will
not
register
for
the
draft,
then
an
enforcement
system
will
be
activated,
and
that
is
the
only
way
that
this
system
will
be
activated.
what
general
lee
has
not
denied
is
that
either
with
respect
to
the
individuals
who
were
prosecuted
or
the
individuals
against
whom
the
beg
policy
was
applied,
that
the
only
individuals
against
whom
it
was
applied
were
those
who
made
some
sort
of
expression
of
first
amendment
activity.
if
this
were
an
active
beg
policy--
mr.
mark
d.
rosenbaum
--sure.
mr.
mark
d.
rosenbaum
well,
they
don't
have
to
indict
as
many
as
700,000.
mr.
mark
d.
rosenbaum
yes,
as
long
as
we
look
at
that
policy
and
say
that
it
can
be
applied
to
both
those
who
speak
out
and
those
who
don't
speak
out,
the
policy
is
sound.
it
is
the
same
thing
as
in
the
minneapolis
case,
where
this
court
struck
down
a
tax
because
it
specially
disadvantaged
the
newspaper.
mr.
mark
d.
rosenbaum
that's
correct.
if
they
enforce
the
law
against
individuals
not
on
a
speech-activated,
content-based
rationale.
if
that
is
not
the
only
way
that
individuals
can
be
identified,
forced
to
register,
or
face
prosecution,
obviously
the
system
is
no
specially
disadvantaging
the
first
amendment.
mr.
mark
d.
rosenbaum
well,
i
don't
think
smoking
in
the
elevator--
mr.
mark
d.
rosenbaum
--if
this
court
held
that
that
was
an
exercise
of
first
amendment
rights,
certainly
that--
mr.
mark
d.
rosenbaum
--yes,
and
that
is
in
response
to
justice
rehnquist's
point
before.
that
is,
the
government
has
a
whole
variety
of
offenses,
not
only
tax
and
census
and
the
other
matters
that
were
mentioned,
but
in
every
crime
there
are
individuals
who
stand
up
and
confess,
and
they
are
prosecuted.
the
point
is
really
a
dual
one,
first,
that
they
are
prosecuted
because
their
speech...
their
speech
is
not
political
in
all
senses.
that
is,
there
are
people
who
confess
out
of
a
sense
of
contrition,
a
sense
of
guilt.
in
addition,
the
enforcement
system
in
those
instances
is
not
strictly
limited
to
those
who
get
up
like
roskolnokov
and
say,
i
confess
out
of
guilt.
it
is
an
across
the
board
policy--
mr.
mark
d.
rosenbaum
--i
assume
in
your
system
you
are
indicating
that
these
individuals
would
identify
themselves
by
writing
the
governor
of
the
state
of
virginia
or
speaking
out.
those
individuals--
mr.
mark
d.
rosenbaum
--yes.
mr.
mark
d.
rosenbaum
as
long
as
that
system
had,
as
justice
stevens
indicated,
a
component
that
would
say,
not
only
those
people
who
are
speaking
out
can
be
prosecuted.
the
government
may
not
only
prosecute
or
investigate
those
individuals.
it
may
make
them
a
priority
for
nonspeech
reasons.
mr.
mark
d.
rosenbaum
there
are
two
answers
to
that,
chief
justice
burger.
first,
with
respect
to
the
handgun
example
itself,
there
is
no
indication
that
eyewitnesses
couldn't
spot
an
individual
with
a
handgun.
there
would
be
no
situation,
as
in
this
case,
that
if
an
individual
decided
to
be
silent,
would
be
quiet,
that
that
individual
could
absolutely
guarantee
that
they
would
not
be
found
out.
but
the
second
point
is
actually
a
larger
point,
and
more
critical
here,
and
that
is
that
unlike
the
virginia
handgun
situation,
this
government
had
alternative
enforcement
systems,
alternative
enforcement
systems
that
were
available,
as
the
district
court
found,
from
the
very
beginning.
and
if
the
government
didn't
know
who
these
other
individuals
were
at
the
time
it
selected
david
wayte,
it
was
because
it
deliberately
elected
not
to
know.
it
deliberately
elected
not
to
go
after
anyone
except
those
individuals
who
exercised
their
first
amendment
rights.
