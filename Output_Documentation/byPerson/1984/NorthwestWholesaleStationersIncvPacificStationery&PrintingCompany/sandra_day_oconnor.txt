mr.
sweeney,
i
take
it
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
to
support
the
district
court's
observation
that
the
exclusion
of
pacific
didn't
affect
competition.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
i
know
that.
is
there
anything
in
the
record
that
would
support
it?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
would
there
be
enough
then
in
the
record
to
even
apply
the
kind
of
quick
look
analysis
the
sg
is
suggesting
should
be
applied?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
if
a
per
se
rule
is
applied,
that
burden
doesn't
exist,
i
suppose.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mrs.
o'sullivan,
when
does
the
so-called
quick
look
that
you
espouse
shade
into
the
closer
look
of
a
rule
of
reason?
it
seems
to
me
that
there
is
a
shading
there
that
is
a
little
difficult
to
understand
or
apply
for
courts.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
but
presumably
here
you
would
suggest
that
the
trial
court
has
to
have
certain
facts
before
it
before
it
can
determine
whether
a
per
se
rule
is
appropriate,
or
whether
a
trial
on
the
rule
of
reason
is
appropriate,
and
the
question
is,
how
much
does
it
have
to
have,
and
are
you
going
to
have
a
mini-rule
of
reason
trial
to
determine
whether
to
apply
the
rule
of
reason?
how
do
you
approach
it
in
a
case
like
this?
how
much
do
you
need
to
establish?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
if
summary
judgment
isn't
appropriate,
how
does
the
court
know
whether
to
go
to
trial
on
a
rule
of
reason
or
apply
a
per
se
rule?
i
mean,
you
are
just
looked
in
this
endless
cycle,
it
seems
to
me,
and
i
want
to
know
how
you
break
out
of
it,
and
what
a
poor
trial
court
judge
is
supposed
to
do
as
applied
to
a
case
like
this.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
i
suppose
you
don't
go
to
trial
if
you
apply
a
per
se
rule.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
is
there
enough
on
the
record
in
this
case,
in
the
cross
motions
for
summary
judgment,
for
a
court
to
have
applied
your
so-called
quick
look?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
had
thought
due
process
applied
to
state
action.
i
don't
understand
your
trying
to
import
it
into
purely
private
action.
that
seems
to
me
both
unnecessary
and
unwise
to
your
argument.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
oh,
but
that
was
the
securities
and
exchange
act,
which
had
certain
provisions
that
certainly
aren't
applicable
here,
and
i
can't
imagine
that
we
would
want
to
extend
that
on,
nor
do
i
think
it
is
necessary
to
your
sherman
act
argument.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
that
is
why
the
decision
may
be
one
that
relies
particularly
on
provisions
of
the
securities
and
exchange
act
and
isn't
really
relevant
to
this
situation.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
why
don't
we
return
to
whether
it
is
anticompetitive
conduct,
because
it
seems
to
me
that
is
the
fundamental
inquiry
that
is
at
issue
here,
whether
it
is
anticompetitive.
is
there
anything
in
the
way
of
harm
to
pacific
other
than
the
loss
of
rebates?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
what?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
just
spell
out
in
brief
form
what
harm
occurred
other
than
the
loss
of
rebates.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
let's
see.
pacific
was
a
much
larger
entity
in
terms
of
volume
of
business
than
all
of
northwest
co-op
combined?
is
that
right?
