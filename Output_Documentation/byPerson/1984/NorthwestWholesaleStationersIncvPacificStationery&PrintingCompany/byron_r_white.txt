justice
white
don't
you
think
the
court
of
appeals
said
that
there
was
a
competitive
impact,
adverse
competitive
impact
because
of
denial
of
a
rebate?
didn't
it
say
that?
justice
white
it
is
a
fact,
though,
that
they
were
denied
a
rebate.
justice
white
and
you
think
that
it
is
just
really
an
unsupported
inference
that
denial
of
a
rebate
that
competitors
are
getting
would
hurt
the
competitive
position?
justice
white
well,
you
may
argue
what
the
significance
of
the
evidence
is,
but
that
is
what
the
court
of
appeals
relied
on,
and
said
that
absent
the
robinson-patman
act
exemption,
there
would
be
a
per
se
liability.
that
is
what
it
held,
isn't
it?
justice
white
and
then
said
they
couldn't
take
advantage
of
this
so-called
exemption
because
of
procedural
default.
justice
white
you
mean
beyond
saying
that--
justice
white
--beyond
saying
that
there
was
a
denial
of
a
rebate
which
had
an
anticompetitive
impact.
justice
white
that
is
what
they
relied
on.
justice
white
how
much
more
analysis
do
you
want?
justice
white
you
just
think
the
look
was
a
little
too
quick?
justice
white
well,
the
court
of
appeals
purported
to
find
an
anticompetitive
effect.
you
just
disagree
with
that
conclusion
based
on
whatever
there
was
in
the
record.
justice
white
why
wouldn't
you
be
willing
to
say
that
if
there
really
are
good
faith
arguments
on
either
side
as
to
what
the
possible
effects
on
competition
might
be,
that
that
in
itself
is
enough
to
say
that
you
cannot
apply
a
per
se
rule?
it
just
isn't
so
plainly
anticompetitive
that
there
can't
be
any
argument
about
it.
justice
white
if
the
so-called
quick
look
review
is
that
there
really
are
good
faith
differences
of
opinion
about
it,
how
can
you
ever
say
that
this
conduct
is
so
plainly
anticompetitive
it
should
be
per
se
illegal?
justice
white
by
that
time
you
have
tried
it
out,
like
a
rule
of
reason
case.
justice
byron
r.
white
are
you
defending
the
court
of
appeals'
judgment,
i
take
it,
that
if
there
had
been
a
hearing,
and
it
had
come
out
exactly
the
same
way,
that
then
there
wouldn't
have
been
a
per
se...
it
wouldn't
be
a
per
se
case,
but
a
rule
of
reason
case,
because
of
the
robinson-patman
act?
do
you
agree
with
that
part
of
the
judgment?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
didn't
think...
you
are
not
defending
the
court
of
appeals
across
the
board.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it
also
sounds
to
me
as
though
you
are
saying
that
this
whole
cooperative,
this
joint
venture
of
competitors
is
itself
in
violation
of
the
sherman
act,
and
suppose
some
supplier
that
the
cooperative
refused
to
deal
with
because
it
could
get
a
cheaper
price
from
somebody
else,
suppose
some
supplier
sued
them
under
the
sherman
act.
this
is
a
joint
buying
effort
by
competitors
that
hurts
me.
isn't
that
what
you
are
saying?
justice
white
i
can't
imagine
why
you
would
make
a
serious
argument
that
the
per
se
rule
ought
to
apply
in
this
case.
justice
white
well,
that
just
sounds
like
that
on
the
facts
of
this
case,
there
ought
to
be
antitrust
liability
under
the
rule
of
reason.
justice
byron
r.
white
did
you
cross-appeal
here?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
want
more
relief
than
the
court
of
appeals
would
give
you.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
say
that
this
is
a
classic
refusal
to
deal
and
it
wouldn't
have
made
any
difference
whatsoever
whether
there
was
a
hearing
or
not.
justice
byron
r.
white
let's
go
back
to
the
court
of
appeals.
that
is
the
judgment
that
is
under
attack
here.
justice
white
do
you
want
us
just
to
affirm
the
court
of
appeals?
is
that
what
you
want?
justice
white
and
then
say
that
the
reason
that
the
per
se
rule
applies
here
is
that
there
was
not
due
process?
justice
white
well,
that
is
what
the
court
of
appeals
said.
justice
white
well,
that
is
giving
you
more
than
you
would
get
under
the
court
of
appeals
judgment.
justice
white
well,
yes,
but
if
it
goes
back
under
the
court
of
appeals
position,
with
a
hearing
they
could
keep
you
out.
justice
white
you
don't
want
that.
