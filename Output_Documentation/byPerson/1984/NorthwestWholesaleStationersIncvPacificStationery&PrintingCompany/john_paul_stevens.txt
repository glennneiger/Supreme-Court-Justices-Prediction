justice
stevens
mr.
sweeney,
do
you
agree
that
this
is
a
concerted
refusal
to
deal?
justice
stevens
do
you
think
you
could
answer
my
question
yes
or
no?
justice
stevens
you
think
it
is
a
concerted
refusal
to
deal?
justice
stevens
well,
if
it
is
not
a
concerted
refusal
to
deal,
isn't
that
the
end
of
the
case?
justice
stevens
maybe
it
is
really
a
very
easy
case.
justice
stevens
mrs.
o'sullivan,
do
you
think
it
covers
the
conduct
in
this
case?
justice
stevens
do
you
think
it
should
be?
justice
stevens
surely
it
is
possible
to
say
whether
it
is
a
concerted
refusal
to
deal
or
not.
you
know
what
they
did.
you
don't
know
the
consequences
of
what
they
did.
is
it
in
the
first
instance
a
concerted
refusal
to
deal?
justice
stevens
is
there
any
case
you
can
cite
in
which
this
court
has
called
something
like
this
a
concerted
refusal
to
deal?
justice
stevens
why
do
you
need
that
information
to
know
whether
it
is
a
concerted
refusal...
what
is
a
concerted
refusal?
isn't
it
an
agreement
among
competitors
not
to
do
business
with
a
certain
person?
justice
stevens
why?
they
did
agree
to
do
business
with
them.
they
will
sell
to
them.
justice
stevens
but
is
that
a
total
refusal
to
deal?
justice
stevens
they
have
also
only
used
it
in
cases
in
which
there
was
a
refusal
to
deal,
haven't
they,
which
isn't
true
here.
justice
stevens
that
was
a
total
refusal
to
deal,
wasn't
it?
all
the
members
agreed
they
wouldn't
do
business
with
people
who
didn't
belong
to
the
associated
press.
you
don't
have
that
here,
do
you?
justice
stevens
it
certainly
can't
be
a
per
se
refusal
to
deal
unless
it
is
a
refusal
to
deal.
justice
stevens
and
i
have
been
trying
to
figure
out
whether
it
is
a
refusal
to
deal
or
not,
and
everybody
is
kind
of
wishy-washy
on
that
point.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
say
classic.
what
is
the
closest
case
to
this
in
our
cases?
justice
john
paul
stevens
not
just
a
refusal
to
admit.
they
also
refused
to
sell
news
to
nonmembers,
didn't
they?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
this
co-op
does
not
refuse
to
sell
goods
to
your
client,
did
it?
justice
stevens
this
is
a
partial
refusal
to
deal
in
your
view
because
it
is
a
refusal
to
sell
at
the
same
price
that
they
sell
to
everyone
else,
in
effect?
the
net
price
is
not
the
same.
justice
stevens
refusal
to
deal,
but
what
did
they
refuse
to
sell
to
your
opponent?
not
warehouse
space.
not
pencils
and
paper.
what
did
they
refuse
to
sell?
justice
stevens
it
is
a
price
discrimination
case.
justice
stevens
is
it
your
view
that
such
a
group
has
a
duty
to
admit
anyone
who
applies?
justice
stevens
do
you
have
a
view
on
my
question?
justice
stevens
specifically,
could
they
have
had
a
rule
that
we
will
not
admit
combination
wholesalers
and
resalers,
we
will
just
admit
retailers?
would
that
have
been
unlawful?
justice
stevens
but
now
where
is
your
correlative
self-regulation
function
in
the
case
of
cooperatives?
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
think
that
would
have
violated
the
sherman
act
without
the
grandfather
clause?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
not
grandfathered,
so
this
of
course
means
that
you
have
to
get
out
because
you
have
a
dual
operation.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
that
is
the
anticompetitive
purpose
you
are
talking
about?
justice
john
paul
stevens
could
they
have
organized
in
the
first
instance
having
that
anticompetitive
rule
in
the
bylaws?
you
don't
want
to
answer
that,
i
guess.
justice
john
paul
stevens
even
though
it
is
the
heart
of
your
case
when
they
make
the
change.
justice
john
paul
stevens
even
though
it
is
the
heart
of
your
case
when
they
make
a
change
in
the
bylaws
to
impose
that
requirement.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
you
say
arbitrarily.
supposing
they
said,
we
will
have
one
member
from
each
market
area,
and
no
more
than
one
member
from
any
given
market
area.
would
that
be
per
se
illegal?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
are
getting
closer
to
a
concerted
refusal
to
deal.
justice
stevens
is
it
not
true
that
its
business
has
flourished?
justice
stevens
more
relatively
than
others.
justice
stevens
i
see.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
the
dollars
are
much
larger
than
the
dollar
amount
of
the
rebates,
aren't
they?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
if
you
make
that
argument,
isn't
justice
white
right
that
you
will
always
have
that
kind
of
competitive
impact,
and
if
that
is
enough,
why
then
that
is
a
per
se
rule?
justice
john
paul
stevens
that
is
what
you
are
arguing
for,
i
suppose.
justice
john
paul
stevens
let
me
stop
you
right
there
for
a
moment.
can
a
co-op...
could
a
co-op,
like
topco,
for
example,
say,
we
won't
let
a&b
in,
we
won't
let
his
companies
in
to
join
our
co-op?
justice
john
paul
stevens
let
me
just
ask,
could
a
co-op
put
a
size
limit
on
and
say,
we
won't
have
big
members
who
exceed
a
certain
sales
volume?
justice
john
paul
stevens
why
do
you
have
to
have
a
procompetitive
justification
for
that?
what
in
the
law
says
that...
say
they
just
want
to
have
people
whose
names
begin
with
x
as
members.
the
sherman
act
would
forbid
them
from
having
some
kind
of
an
arbitrary
limitation
on
membership.
is
that
what
you
are
saying?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
does
the
sherman
act
require
open
membership
in
co-ops?
i
think
you
said
no
to
that.
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
topco,
of
course,
there
were
agreements
restricting
where
the
members
could
sell,
the
territories
in
which
they
could
sell,
and
the
like,
which
you
don't
have
here,
and
that
is
why
you
don't
rely
heavily
on
it,
as
i
understand
it.
justice
stevens
well,
they
just
said
to
him,
we
will
sell
to
you
like
everybody
else
on
the
track,
but
we
are
just
not
going
to
invite
you
to
dinner.

[generallaughter.]
justice
stevens
sounds
like
a
price
discrimination
case.
justice
stevens
mr.
sweeney,
don't
you
think
the
record
does
raise
an
inference
that
the
reason
this
man
was
excluded
was
because
he
was
a
partial
wholesaler?
isn't
that
at
least
a
permissible
inference,
that
he
had
a
dual
operation?
justice
stevens
and
we
are
on
summary
judgment.
justice
stevens
so
conceivably
that...
but
it
seems
to
me
that
nobody
really
argues
about
it,
but
is
that
permissible
or
not,
to
exclude
somebody
for
that
reason?
your
opponent
says
it
clearly
is
not,
because
that
is
an
anticompetitive
purpose,
and
you
haven't
talked
much
about
it.
justice
stevens
well,
if
it
is
in
the
record,
and
there
is
an
inference
there
that
would
raise
a
question
of
fact
of
summary
judgment,
i
would
submit
it
is
in
the
case.
justice
stevens
yes,
but
are
you
asking...
what
are
you
asking
for?
are
you
asking
for
a
trial,
or
for
summary
judgment
in
your
favor?
justice
stevens
you
don't
take
the
same
position
the
government
does
as
i
read
it.
justice
stevens
you
would
rather
try
the
case
and
lose.
justice
stevens
what
about
an
admission
policy
excluding
dual
distributors?
do
you
think
that
is
lawful?
justice
stevens
in
this
case,
that
they
had
an
out
and
out...
this
very
bylaw
they
have
got
in
this
case.
do
you
think
that
is
permissible?
