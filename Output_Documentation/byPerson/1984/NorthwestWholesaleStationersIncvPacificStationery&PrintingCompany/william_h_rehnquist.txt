justice
rehnquist
mr.
sweeney,
procedurally,
there
are
motions
to
dismiss,
there
are
motions
for
summary
judgment,
there
are
motions
for
partial
summary
judgment,
there
are
trials,
there
are
judgments
after
trials.
where
does
this
threshold
analysis...
what
category
procedurally
does
it
fit
under?
is
it
a
motion
for
partial
summary
judgment?
justice
rehnquist
you
see
it
as
simply
a
motion
on
a
question
of
law
that
is
involved
in
the
case,
that
the
trial
judge
could
decide
that
question
of
law
at
any
stage
of
the
trial
just
like
he
might
decide
any
other
question
of
law.
justice
rehnquist
how
do
you
decide
that
on
summary
judgment
if
there
are
factual
disputes?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
does
the
absence
of
due
process,
as
you
put
it,
add
to
the
concerted
refusal
to
deal?
what
if
they
had
had
elaborate
hearings
and
all
sorts
of
evidence
had
been
admitted
before
the
board
of
governors,
and
they
had
reached
exactly
the
same
result?
would
that
make
it
any
less
a
concerted
refusal
to
deal
if
it
was
a
concerted
refusal
to
deal
to
start
out
with?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes,
but
my
question
was,
what
if
after
such
a
hearing
the
board
reached
exactly
the
result
that
it
reached
here
as
you
claim
without
due
process?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
does
the
silver
case
make
much
sense
in
this
context?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
do
you
think
it
makes
much
sense
in
this
context?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
go
ahead.
justice
rehnquist
that
is
a
matter
of
oregon
law,
isn't
it,
whether
they
are
entitled
to
throw
him
out
under
the
rules
of
the
cooperative?
justice
rehnquist
but
what
in
the
antitrust
laws,
the
sherman
act
or
the
robinson-patman
act
talks
about
applying
due
process
to
private
corporations
other
than
the
very
unusual
facts
of
the
silver
case?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
isn't
a
necessary
element
of
your
argument
there
that
they
threw
him
out
in
a
way
that
they
didn't
throw
other
people
out?
