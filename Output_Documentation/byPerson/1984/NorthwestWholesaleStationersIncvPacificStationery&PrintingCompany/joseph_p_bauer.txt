mr.
joseph
p.
bauer
good
morning,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
i
would
like
to
begin
with
a
brief
summary
of
our
position.
the
essence
of
our
argument
is
that
the
record
reveals
a
classic
concerted
refusal
to
deal,
the
classic
group
boycott,
characterized
by
anticompetitive
intent.
mr.
joseph
p.
bauer
mr.
justice
stevens,
there
are
a
number
of
cases
which
are
like
this
case.
the
associated
press
case,
for
example,
involved
a
group
of
competitors
who
had
combined
into
creating
a
joint
venture
there
in
the
newspaper
industry
and
who
refused
to
admit
potential
new
entrants,
and
this
court
held
that
considering--
mr.
joseph
p.
bauer
--precisely,
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
p.
bauer
i
was
listening
to
your
questions
to
petitioner,
your
honor.
i
was
struck
by
that,
and
we
recognize
in
our
brief
that
this
is
not
a
complete
refusal
to
deal.
the
refusal
to
deal
here
consists
of
a
denial
of
rebates,
but
there
is
a
willingness
to
sell.
there
are
several
responses
to
that.
one,
in
this
court's
opinion
in
silver,
and
we
mentioned
that
in
footnote
15
of
our
brief,
this
court
said,
and
if
i
might
just
read
very
briefly
from
the
court's
opinion,
"nor
does
any
excuse
derive
from
the
fact
that
the
collective
refusal
to
deal
is
only
with
reference
to
private
wires.
"
"the
members
remaining
are
willing
to
deal
with
petitioners
for
the
purchase
and
sale
of
securities.
"
that
is,
a
partial
concerted
refusal
to
deal
was
unlawful
just
as
a
complete
concerted
refusal
to
deal
was,
and
the
court
went
on
to
say,
"a
valuable
service
germane
to
petitioner's
business
and
important
to
their
effective
competition
with
others
was
withheld
from
them
by
collective
action.
"
that
was
enough
to
create
a
violation
of
the
sherman
act.
here
what
you
have
in
the
record
is--
mr.
joseph
p.
bauer
--no,
your
honor,
i
think
we
would
characterize
it
differently.
as
a
practical
matter,
this
is
a
refusal
to
deal.
the
purpose
of
forming
a
cooperative--
mr.
joseph
p.
bauer
--they
refused
to
sell
the
same
goods
that
they
were
selling
to
every
one
of
pacific's
competitors
at
the
same
price.
mr.
joseph
p.
bauer
no,
it
is
more
than
a
price
discrimination
case,
your
honor.
this
is
not
a
robinson-patman
case.
this
is
a
sherman
act
claim.
what
happened
in
this
case
was
that
a
group
of
competitors
created
a
cooperative
organization
to
allow
them
better
to
compete
with
their
larger
rivals.
the
function
of
a
cooperative
organization
is
to
use
joint
buying
power
of
individuals
to
obtain
goods
at
lower
prices,
to
confer
a
competitive
benefit
on
every
one
of
the
members.
mr.
joseph
p.
bauer
your
honor,
that
raises
different
problems.
this
case
does
not
raise
that
issue.
now,
in
fact,
in
both
the
associated
press
case--
mr.
joseph
p.
bauer
--i
would
think
in
this
case
there
might
be
reasons
that
the
defendant
cooperative
might
not
have
had
to
admit
the
plaintiff
in
1978.
when
the
cooperative
was
founded
in
1953
and
the
defendant
chose
not
to
apply--
mr.
joseph
p.
bauer
--i
am
not
prepared
to
answer
that
question,
your
honor.
that
is
not
the
question
presented
by
this
case.
it
seems
to
me
that
in
this
case
we
were
talking
about
an
organization
formed
to
confer
a
competitive
benefit
on
all
the
members
of
the
organization,
which
then
arbitrarily,
without
any
due
process,
without
any
notification,
without
any
hearing,
arbitrarily
expels
one
of
the
members
of
that
organization
for
anticompetitive
purposes,
that
that
is
a
classic
concerted
refusal
to
deal.
and
the
mere
fact
that
the
defendant
remained
prepared
to
sell
goods
to
pacific
at
elevated
prices,
at
a
different
price
than
every
other
member
of
the
cooperative
had
to
pay,
is
not
a
real
honest
willingness
to
sell.
mr.
joseph
p.
bauer
well,
justice
rehnquist,
one
response
might
be,
if
they
had
gone
through
that
elaborate
procedure,
and
if
in
fact
the
facts
which
are
suggested
in
the
record,
which
suggested
that
the
expulsion
of
the
plaintiff
pacific
was
inappropriate,
had
that
hearing
been
held,
our
suggestion
is
that
the
plaintiff
would
never
have
been
expelled
from
the
organization.
mr.
joseph
p.
bauer
well,
the
silver
case
talks
to
that.
mr.
joseph
p.
bauer
your
honor,
silver
addresses
two
very--
mr.
joseph
p.
bauer
--short
answer,
yes.
maybe
i
can--
mr.
joseph
p.
bauer
--so
into
a
little
more
detail,
justice
rehnquist.
silver
talks
to
a
particular
issue.
that
is,
the
antitrust
laws
made
the
conduct
of
the
new
york
stock
exchange
unlawful,
and
this
court
said
that
conduct
would
have
been
a
per
se
unlawful
concerted
refusal
to
deal
absent
the
possibility
that
the
self-regulation
duty
imposed
on
the
new
york
stock
exchange
by
the
securities
and
exchange
act
might
have
conferred
an
exemption.
mr.
joseph
p.
bauer
your
honor,
that
is
not
necessary,
because
i
am
going
to
suggest
that
silver
stands
for
two
very
separate
propositions.
the
first
proposition,
and
the
one
that
has
been
talked
to
before,
is
the
possibility
that
if
self-regulation
exists,
the
conduct
which
might
otherwise
be...
excuse
me,
the
conduct
which
might
otherwise
be
unlawful
might
in
fact
now
be
subject
to
a
rule
of
reason
analysis
instead.
that
is,
the
presence
of
a
self-regulation
duty,
in
that
case
imposed
by
the
securities
exchange
act,
might
have
converted
what
was
otherwise
unlawful
into
lawful
conduct.
this
case
involves
precisely
the
opposite,
and
so
self-regulation
is
not
an
issue.
in
fact,
what
is
involved
in
this
case
is
that
you
have
already
a
concerted
refusal
to
deal
which
is
arguably
ambiguous.
that
is,
it
may
be
difficult
to
characterize
the
conduct.
we
allege
that
this
conduct
is
characterized
clearly
by
anticompetitive
intent.
we
assert
that
this
conduct
was
done
with
anticompetitive
purposes.
but
arguably
that
is
ambiguous.
in
this
case,
where
there
is
a
complete
absence
of
due
process,
no
notice,
no
hearing,
no
explanation
offered,
in
that
case,
what
that
absence
of
due
process
does
is
help
us
to
characterize
the
conduct
and
make--
mr.
joseph
p.
bauer
--justice
o'connor,
in
fact,
in
the
silver
case,
where
the
court
suggested--
mr.
joseph
p.
bauer
--well,
i
was
merely
addressing
myself
to
your
state
action
question,
your
honor.
clearly
the
new
york
stock
exchange
is
not
a
state,
although
some
might
think
it
rises
to
that
level.
mr.
joseph
p.
bauer
but
in
the
silver
case,
what
the
court
recognized
was
the
importance
of
due
process
even
in
those
kinds
of
private
transactions
to
ensure
that
persons
did
not
engage
in
anticompetitive
conduct,
and
so
to
return
to
justice
rehnquist's
question,
our
suggestion
here
is--
mr.
joseph
p.
bauer
--well,
your
honor,
there
is
more,
and
i
would
like
to
amplify
on--
mr.
joseph
p.
bauer
--what
happened
was
that--
mr.
joseph
p.
bauer
--well,
in
addition
to
the
loss
of
rebates,
since
pacific
was
no
longer
a
member
of...
excuse
me,
was
no
longer
a
member
of
the
cooperative,
and
as
a
practical
matter
then
was
precluded
from
buying,
not
that
it
could
not,
but
that
as
a
practical
matter,
given
the
elevated
prices,
it
would
not
buy,
what
happened
was,
pacific
then
had
to
engage
in
greater
inventory,
had
to
expand
what
went
on
in
their
own
warehouses.
mr.
joseph
p.
bauer
no,
it
is
not
quite
right,
your
honor.
in
fact,
what
you
have
is
that
in
terms
of
total
sales,
as
the
brief
suggests,
northwest's
total
sales
were
somewhat
less
than
pacific's
total
sales.
on
the
other
hand,
when
you
compare
apples
and
apples,
that
is,
the
particular
supply
lines
that
northwest
engaged
in,
and
then
the
particular
supply
lines
that
pacific
engaged
in,
and
then
compared
them
at
the
wholesale
level,
my
recollection
was
that
pacific
was
of
the
order
of
$1.9
million
and
northwest
was
approximately
$5
million.
so
in
fact
on
a
comparable
apples
to
apples
level,
pacific
was
somewhat
smaller
than
northwest.
your
honors,
we
suggest
that
in
this
case
what
you
have
is
the
arbitrary
expulsion
of
a
member
of
the
cooperative
for
anticompetitive
purposes
with
an
anticompetitive
effect.
let
me
talk
for
a
moment
to
the
anticompetitive
purposes,
and
if
i
could
do
that,
i
would
like
briefly
to
talk
a
little
bit
about
the
facts
of
this
case.
what
happened
was
that
in
1972,
the
present
owner
of
pacific,
mr.
john
stirek,
began
purchasing
stock
in
pacific.
in
1974,
northwest
adopted
bylaws
which
did
two
things.
one,
it
made
membership
in
the
cooperative
by
so-called
dual
operators,
companies
which
were
both
wholesalers
and
retailers,
unavailable,
but
that
new
bylaw
contained
a
grandfather
clause
which
exempted
pacific.
mr.
joseph
p.
bauer
if
they
had
adopted
the
new
bylaw
in
1974,
your
honor,
and
then
because
of
the--
mr.
joseph
p.
bauer
--we
would
maintain
absolutely.
in
fact,
our
position,
justice
stevens,
is
that
that
in
fact
is
precisely
what
happened.
mr.
joseph
p.
bauer
absolutely.
in
fact,
our--
mr.
joseph
p.
bauer
--i
didn't
want
to
answer
you
before,
and
i
am
not
sure
i--
mr.
joseph
p.
bauer
--excuse
me?
mr.
joseph
p.
bauer
well,
our
proposition,
justice
stevens,
is
the
following,
that
what
you
have
here
is
an
organization
composed
of
members
designed
to
confer
competitive
advantages
on
one
another
by
coming
together
and
amalgamating
their
joint
buying
power.
and
what
they
have
done
is
arbitrarily
decided,
but
we
don't
like
one
of
our
members.
we
don't
like
him
because--
mr.
joseph
p.
bauer
--now
we
are
talking
about
a
concerted
refusal
to
deal,
and
we
are
getting
closer
to
the
topco
case,
and
i
guess
if
this
is
like
topco--
mr.
joseph
p.
bauer
--i
would
say
absolutely.
in
fact,
in
topco
you
will
recall,
justice
stevens,
this
court
said
one
of
the
things
that
was
unlawful
about
that
conduct
was
the
unwillingness
to
admit
perspective
members.
what
the
members
of
topco
did,
you
will
recall,
is,
they
got
together
because
they
wanted
to
confer
a
competitive
advantage
on
one
another,
the
so-called
private
brand
labels,
so
they
could
compete
better
with
a&p
and
kroeger
and
national.
and
they
were
leaving
all
the
mom
and
pops
out
of
the
organization,
and
they
applied
and
wouldn't
be
admitted.
the
district
court
said
that
is
okay
because
it
confers
a
competitive
benefit
on
the
members
of
topco,
allowing
them
better
to
compete
with
a&p,
and
this
court
reversed,
and
this
court
said,
it
is
not
for
those
members
to
make
that
decision
as
to
whether
or
not
to
benefit
themselves
to
the
disadvantages
of
prospective
members.
that
is
precisely
what
we
would
have
here
under
your
hypothetical.
now,
what
we
have
here,
however,
arguably
the
facts
are
more
ambiguous.
if
in
1974
they
had
simply
amended
the
bylaws
and
kicked
pacific
out,
it
seems
to
me
that
would
clearly
evidence
anticompetitive
intent.
what
you
have
here
is
arguably
more
ambiguous,
because
what
you
have
is
a
bylaw
adopted
which
is
designed
to
impact
only
on
pacific.
there
is
also
this
notification
provision,
but
they
go
along
without
any
problem.
in
1977,
the
sale
of
stock
from
the
former
owner
of
pacific
to
mr.
stirek
was
completed,
and
mr.
stirek
doesn't
notify
northwest,
and
one
of
the
reasons
he
may
not
have
notified
northwest
is
because
he
didn't
even
think
the
provision
applied
to
him.
he
started
buying
this
stock
in
1972.
he
was
already
a
shareholder.
this
goes
to
justice
rehnquist's
question.
the
reason
i
suggested
due
process
was
important
is,
if
that
hearing
had
been
held,
that
fact
would
have
come
out.
it
would
have
come
out
that
we
shouldn't
kick
this
guy
out
because
he
is
entitled
to
stay
in
here.
they
had
a
hearing...
excuse
me.
they
had
a
meeting
where
they
decided
to
throw
him
out,
and
never
gave
him
any
notice.
never
gave
him
any
warning.
mr.
joseph
p.
bauer
well,
it
is
clear
that
under
oregon
law
cooperatives
can
adopt
bylaws,
and
it
is
clear
that
under
oregon
law
a
coop
can
regulate
itself,
but
i
would
have
thought
that
the
antitrust
laws
supersede
the
oregon
laws
under
the
supremacy
clause.
mr.
joseph
p.
bauer
as
i
suggest,
we
do
not
assert
that
the
conduct
is
unlawful
because
of
the
absence
of
due
process,
and
so
i
want
to
make
that
clear.
our
assertion,
your
honor,
is
that
this
is
a
classic
concerted
refusal
to
deal.
the
reason
it
is
a
classic
concerted
refusal
to
deal
is
because
the
defendants
threw
the
plaintiff
out
of
the
cooperative
for
anticompetitive
intent
with
an
anticompetitive
effect.
how
do
we
know
that
they
had
an
anticompetitive
intent
in
an
arguably
ambiguous
record,
arguably
ambiguous?
i
would
suggest
the
facts
leave
absolutely
no
ambiguity.
but
one
of
the
ways
we
resolve
the
ambiguity
is
because
of
the
procedure,
so
it
is
not
that
due
process
is
necessary,
and
i
think
that
would
be
my
response
to
justice
o'connor's
question,
it
is
not
that
due
process
is
necessary,
it
is
that
due
process
is
relevant
to
characterization.
when
we
throw
him
out
of
the
cooperative
without
any
due
process,
we
have
a
better
handle
on
what
went
on,
we
have
a
better
way
of
knowing
that
it
was
with
anticompetitive
intent.
we
have
a
better
way
of
knowing
that
the
reason
they
didn't
want
him
in
there
is
because
he
was
a
more
efficient
competitor.
they
wanted
to
get
rid
of
him
because
he
was
maybe
working
a
little
bit
better,
and
that
is
precisely--
mr.
joseph
p.
bauer
--well,
in
fact,
justice
rehnquist,
they
did
not
throw
anybody
else
out.
now,
in
fact,
there
is
some
evidence
in
the
record
which
suggests
that
other
members
of
the
cooperative
may...
now,
i
say
may...
may
have
violated
some
bylaws,
just
as
i
say
we
may
have
violated
some
bylaws.
it
seems
to
me
that
an
examination
of
the
record
would
suggest
that
since
the
purchase
of
stock
began
in
1972,
and
the
bylaw
didn't
even
go
into
effect
until
1974,
the
plaintiff
itself
did
not
violate
the
bylaw,
and
had
that
come
forward,
the
plaintiff
would
not
have
been
thrown
out
of
the
organization.
mr.
joseph
p.
bauer
absolutely
not,
justice
white.
mr.
joseph
p.
bauer
no,
we
are
not.
that
is,
our
position
is
that
this
is--
mr.
joseph
p.
bauer
--no,
justice
white,
that
it
not
what
we
are
saying.
what
we
are
saying
is...
and
by
the
way,
the
argument
is
made
that
this
court
ought
to
be
reluctant
to
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
because
of
some
perceived
adverse
impact
that
this
might
have
on
cooperatives,
and
i
say
quite
the
opposite.
indeed,
not
only
do
we
agree
that
cooperatives
have
procompetitive
efficiency-enhancing
characteristics.
cooperatives
are
desirable.
that
is
why
we
want
to
be
back
in
the
cooperative.
so
we
are
not
challenging
the
cooperative
generally.
indeed,
we
are
not
even
challenging
the
possible
requirement
that
notification
has
to
be
given.
mr.
joseph
p.
bauer
because
what
we
are
challenging
is
very
limited
conduct.
what
we
are
challenging
is
the
arbitrary
expulsion--
mr.
joseph
p.
bauer
--no,
your
honor.
we
are
saying
that
this
is
a
classic
group
boycott,
a
classic
concerted
refusal
to
deal,
but
that
this
court
can
write
a
very
narrow
opinion
holding
that
we
are
only
talking
about
very
specific
conduct,
what
is
a
classic
concerted
refusal
to
deal--
mr.
joseph
p.
bauer
--no,
we
did
not,
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
p.
bauer
no,
in
fact,
the
court
of
appeals
decision...
let's--
mr.
joseph
p.
bauer
--let's
go
back
to
the
trial
court
for
a
moment,
justice
white.
mr.
joseph
p.
bauer
well,
the
reason
i
wanted
to
start
at
the
trial
court
was,
at
the
trial
court
level
there
are
cross
motions
for
summary
judgment,
but
in
the
district
court
all
that
the
plaintiff
sought,
all
that
we
sought
was
partial
summary
judgment
with
respect
to
liability
and
no
determination
with
respect
to
the
damages
or
injunctive
relief.
in
fact,
what
we
are
principally
asking
for
is
injunctive
relief.
now,
what
the
court
of
appeals
held
was
that
not
only
did
the
district
court
err
in
granting
summary
judgment
for
the
defendant,
but
it
should
have
granted
summary
judgment
for
the
plaintiff,
and
in
fact
entered
that
judgment.
now,
it
is
that
judgment
with
respect
to...
excuse
me,
that
partial
summary
judgment
with
respect
to
liability
that
we
are
asking
this
court
to
uphold,
but
our
position
is
that
what
we
have--
mr.
joseph
p.
bauer
--absolutely.
mr.
joseph
p.
bauer
no.
mr.
joseph
p.
bauer
i
would
ask
you
to
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
court
but
not
necessarily
its
reasoning.
mr.
joseph
p.
bauer
well,
i
think
the
relief
we
are
asking,
your
honor,
is
precisely
the
same.
that
is,
the
relief
we
are
asking
is
that
if
you
remand
it
to
the
district
court
for
a
determination
of
the
proper
remedy,
the
proper
remedy,
we
suggest,
is
principally
one
of
injunctive
relief,
that
the
plaintiff
be
readmitted
to
the
cooperative.
i
come
back
to
your
earlier
question,
justice
white--
mr.
joseph
p.
bauer
--no,
as
i
was
saying,
because--
mr.
joseph
p.
bauer
--i
don't
think
that
the
court
of
appeals
has...
i
don't
think
the
court
of
appeals
decision
is,
give
these
guys
a
hearing
and
try
over
again.
that
is
not
what
the
court
of
appeals
said.
what
the
court
of
appeals
said
is,
this
is
a
classic
concerted
refusal
to
deal.
then
the
court
of
appeals
went
on
to
examine
the
possibility
that
because
of
the
duty
of
self-regulation
imposed
under
the
silver
line
of
cases,
that
what
would
otherwise
be
a
classic
group
boycott
might
nonetheless
be
subject
to
rule
of
reason
analysis,
and
then
because
it
found
that
the
denver
rockets
exception
didn't
exist,
came
back
to
where
it
started
and
said,
yes,
this
is
a
classic
concerted
refusal
to
deal
subject
to
per
se
liability.
and
that
is
exactly
what
we
are
asking
this
court
to
hold,
that
what
you
have
here
is...
again,
i
think
it
is
important
to
focus
on
what
we
are
complaining
about
and
the
very
narrow
aspect
of
this
case
that
we
are
asking
this
court
to
look
at,
that
is,
the
arbitrary
expulsion
of
a
member
of
the
cooperative,
a
cooperative
which
was
formed
for
competitive
benefits,
designed
to
confer
competitive
benefits
on
all
the
members,
which
threw
one
member
of
the
cooperative
out
for
anticompetitive
purposes,
and
with
adverse
effects
not
only
on
a
competitor
but
on
competition.
maybe
it
would
be
useful
to
address
that
question.
what
kind
of
effect
was
there
on
competition?
the
plaintiff,
pacific,
was
denied
rebates.
the
rebates
were
the
very
reason
for
creating
this
cooperative.
if
there
were
no
rebates,
there
wouldn't
have
been
any
need
to
have
the
cooperative.
the
plaintiff
was
thrown
out
of
the
cooperative.
the
plaintiff
was
denied
the
rebates.
and
so
when
the
plaintiff
was
competing
with
all
of
the
other
members
of
the
cooperative
it
competed
at
a
price
disadvantage.
mr.
joseph
p.
bauer
it
is
true
that
its
business
has
prospered.
however--
mr.
joseph
p.
bauer
--we
have
no
evidence
whatsoever
in
the
record
about
the
others.
mr.
joseph
p.
bauer
there
is
evidence
in
the
record
as
to
the
percentage
increase
that
the
plaintiff's
business.
mr.
joseph
p.
bauer
the
actual
dollar
increase
of
sales
is
larger
than
the
amount
of
rebates.
we
have
no
information,
again,
on
the
profit
margin,
but
there
are
several
responses,
justice
stevens.
one,
even
if
it
is
true
that
the
plaintiff
has
prospered,
the
fact
of
the
matter
is,
it
may
have
prospered
even
more
had
that
conduct
not
taken
place.
this
court
addressed
that
question
in
the
standard
stations
case.
there
is
a
second
response,
and
it
seems
to
me
an
important
response.
mr.
joseph
p.
bauer
well,
in
fact--
mr.
joseph
p.
bauer
--that
may
well
be
a
part
of
our
argument,
justice
stevens,
but
i
would
make
a
different
argument
as
well.
what
you
have
here
is
conduct
which
is
characterized
clearly
by
anticompetitive
effect.
a
review
of
the
scenario
here
reveals
that
what
the
defendant
did
was
throw
the
plaintiff
out
of
the
cooperative
because
the
plaintiff
was
undesirable,
it
was
more
efficient,
it
was
bigger,
for
whatever
reason.
the
plaintiff...
excuse
me,
the
defendant
wanted
to
get
rid
of
the
plaintiff
for
those
anticompetitive
reasons.
perhaps
it
didn't
have
quite
the
anticompetitive
effect
that
they
desired.
mr.
joseph
p.
bauer
well,
but
this
case
perhaps
raises
a
different
kind
of
question.
what
if
30
years
ago--
mr.
joseph
p.
bauer
--the
answer,
your
honor,
yes,
if
there
is
a
reasonable
procompetitive
justification
for
doing
it.
mr.
joseph
p.
bauer
again,
you
are
asking
a
third
time
a
question
i
haven't
answered...
i
recognized
the
first
two...
which
is,
is
there
a
difference
between
admitting
members
and
expelling
members?
the
case
that
we
would
have
here
is,
if
they
impede--
mr.
joseph
p.
bauer
--i
think...
the
answer
is
that
they
do
not,
and
i
will
stand
by
that.
in
fact,
in
two
cases
in
this
court,
both
the
associated
press
case
and
the
terminal
railroad
case,
this
court
required
admission
to
membership
when
that
was
an
essential
function
of
competition.
no,
we
do
not
assert
that
this
is
an
essential
function.
that
is,
pacific
can
indeed
compete
even
if
it
is
not
a
member.
but
go
back
to
topco.
the
mom
and
pops--
mr.
joseph
p.
bauer
--that's
right.
that's
right.
but
i
would
like
to
give
another
illustration,
justice
stevens,
to
the
inquiry
to
what
extent
is
a
competitive
effect
necessary,
and
the
assertion
that
here
the
plaintiff
has
prospered,
so
no
foul,
no
harm.
let
me
give
an
analogy.
let's
assume
that
we
have
a
marathon
race,
and
one
member
of
that
group
that
is
going
to
be
in
the
race
is
a
little
bit
faster
or
a
little
bit
more
determined,
or
has
a
little
bit
more
stamina
than
all
the
rest,
and
so
they
all
get
together
with
the
exception
of
this
one
individual
and
say,
hey,
let's
push
him
off
the
track
somewhere
down
into
the
race.
and
they
do
that.
but
this
man
is
so
determined,
he
dusts
himself
off
and
gets
back
on
the
track
and
runs,
and
maybe
he
even
wins.
he
does
well.
now,
he
has
been
pushed
off
the
track
in
the
same
way
that
the
plaintiff
here
has
been
pushed
out
of
this
organization,
and
the
conduct--
mr.
joseph
p.
bauer
--i
would
suggest,
your
honor,
that
the
analogy
is
a
little
closer
to
saying,
we
will
let
you
run,
but
we
will
put
three-pound
weights
in
your
shoes,
because
what
they
are
doing
is,
they
are
saying,
we
will
sell
to
you,
but
we
will
sell
to
you
at
a
substantial
competitive
disadvantage,
and
we
are
selling
to
you
at
such
a
disadvantage
that
no
rational
business
person
would
do
that.
mr.
joseph
p.
bauer
if
it
were
not
for
the
exemption,
section
13b
of
the
robinson-patman
act,
it
would
be,
and
we
would
have
added
that
count,
too.
but
the
fact
that
it
nails
something
post-discrimination
does
not
make
it
nor
a
sherman
act
violation.
see,
in
my
example,
your
honor,
what
you
have
is
an
attempt
to
injure.
now,
they
may
not
have
succeeded,
but
they
sure
as
heck
intended
to
injure.
what
they
did
was
unfair.
what
they
did
was
unlawful.
and
the
fact
that
it
wasn't
successful
doesn't
make
it
any
the
less
unfair
or
unlawful.
what
you
have
here
is
an
attempt
by
members
of
an
organization
who
have
a
competitive
advantage
among
themselves,
and
they
finally
decide,
hey,
we
don't
like
one
of
our
members,
he
is
a
little
too
efficient,
he
is
a
little
bit
too
much
of
a
threat,
let's
get
rid
of
him
so
we
can
compete
more,
so
we
will
hobble
him.
and
that
is
precisely
what
the
sherman
act
prohibits.
it
prohibits
conduct
which
is
designed
to
injure
competition.
it
is,
as
i
suggest,
a
classic
concerted
refusal
to
deal.
and
even
though
it
may
be
true
that
they
have
not
absolutely
refused
to
deal
with
him,
they
have
refused
to
deal
with
him
in
any
meaningful
sense.
i
see
my
time
is
up,
your
honor.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
thank
you
very
much.
