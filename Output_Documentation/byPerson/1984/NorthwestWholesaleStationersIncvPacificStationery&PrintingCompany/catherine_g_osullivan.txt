ms.
catherine
g.
o'sullivan
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
the
fundamental
reason
for
concern
in
this
case
from
the
government's
perspective
is
that
an
overly
literal
application
of
the
per
se
group
boycott
label
to
conduct
of
joint
ventures
threatens
to
substantially
undercut
their
procompetitive
potential.
this
court
has
often
observed
that
group
boycotts
are
per
se
illegal,
but
is
has
only
characterized
conduct
as
a
group
boycott
in
cases
involving
an
attempt
to
eliminate
rivalry
in
the
sense
of
an
attempt
to
exclude
a
competitor
from
the
market
or
to
eliminate
a
form
of
competition
such
as
price
discounting.
the
group
boycott
or
concerted
refusal
to
deal
label,
however,
literally
covers
a
wide
variety
of
conduct,
and
that
conduct
can
range
from
the
seriously
anticompetitive
to
the
substantially
procompetitive.
ms.
catherine
g.
o'sullivan
i
think
that
is
a
question
of
characterization.
in
our
view,
the
essential
issue
in
the
case
is
whether
this
conduct
should
be
categorized
as
a
concerted
refusal
to
deal,
because
that
category--
ms.
catherine
g.
o'sullivan
--our
view
is
that
from
the
record
that
stands
before
the
court,
it
is
not
possible
to
say
whether
the
net
result
of
this
conduct
is
procompetitive
or
anticompetitive.
ms.
catherine
g.
o'sullivan
it
is
possible
to
characterize
it
that
way,
but
if
that
characterization--
ms.
catherine
g.
o'sullivan
--implies
per
se
illegality,
if
concerted
refusal
to
deal
is
understood
as
a
term
which
means
not
merely
concerted
action
by
competitors
but
concerted
action
by
competitors
ought
to
be
per
se
illegal,
then
we
say
it
is
not
possible
to
characterize
it
that
way
on
this
record.
ms.
catherine
g.
o'sullivan
no.
precisely,
or
at
least
as
we
understand
the
facts
on
this
record,
and
part
of
our
concern
is
that
we
don't
know
enough
about
what
was
actually
happening
here
in
terms
of
the
purpose
or
effect,
but
we
believe--
ms.
catherine
g.
o'sullivan
--if
one
characterizes
it
that
way,
then
yes,
this
would
be
a
concerted
refusal
to
deal.
ms.
catherine
g.
o'sullivan
they
agreed
not
to
do
business
on
a
particular
basis.
ms.
catherine
g.
o'sullivan
that
is
not
a
total
refusal
to
deal,
and
it
is
not
necessarily
anticompetitive,
but
that
is
precisely
our
point,
that
if
one
says
that
any
time
one
refuses
to
do
business
on
a
particular
basis,
that
that
is
necessarily
per
se
illegal,
that
leads
to
the
results
that
we
are
concerned
about,
and
this
court's
decisions
have
very
carefully
limited
that
characterization.
they
have
used
that
term,
which
implies
per
se
illegality,
only
in
cases
that
involved
some
effect
on
the
competitive
marketplace.
ms.
catherine
g.
o'sullivan
that
is,
i
think,
basically
accurate.
one
can
dispute
whether
in
cases
such
as
associated
press,
whether
the
restrictive
membership
requirements.
ms.
catherine
g.
o'sullivan
there
was
a
possibility
of
membership
on
very
restrictive
terms,
but
i
certainly
agree
with
your
point,
which
is
that
the
effect
in
those
cases
has
been
to
exclude
someone
from
the
market,
and
we
think
that
that
is
the
essential
characteristic.
we
think
that
it
is
important
that
before
characterizing
something
as
a
per
se
illegal
concerted
refusal
to
deal,
there
be
a
determination
that
it
is
the
kind
of
conduct
that--
ms.
catherine
g.
o'sullivan
--i
think
that
is
fair
enough.
ms.
catherine
g.
o'sullivan
that
is
fair
enough,
and
i
think
that
this
illustrates
precisely
the
problem,
that
there
has
been
a
tendency
to
use
per
se
labels
as
just
that,
a
label.
if
it
is
literally
possible
to
include
something
within
a
label,
then
the
courts
have
tended
to
assume
that
the
inquiry
was
ended.
and
i
think
as
your
questions
point
out,
that
is
simply
the
beginning
of
the
inquiry.
even
if
one
can
put
certain
words
on
the
conduct,
that
does
not
necessarily
tell
one
very
much
about
their
competitive
status
under
the
sherman
act.
ms.
catherine
g.
o'sullivan
as
the
court
noted
in
the
ncaa
opinion,
sometimes
the
distinction
between
the
rule
of
reason
and
the
per
se
approach
becomes
a
little
blurred.
in
our
view,
the
quick
look
is
a
method
of
analysis.
it
refers
to
the
questions
that
one
must
ask
before
deciding
what
evidence
one
needs
to
determine
that
something
is
anticompetitive
and
thus
a
violation
of
the
sherman
act.
it
is
an
analysis
that
could
be
applied,
i
think,
at
virtually
any
stage
of
the
proceedings.
it
could
well
be
used--
ms.
catherine
g.
o'sullivan
--in
this
case,
for
example,
where
there
were
summary
judgment
motions,
it
would
be
appropriate
for
a
court
that
was
confronted
with
a
motion
claiming
that
the
offense
was
per
se
illegal
to
apply
the
quick
look
and
determine
whether
the
offense...
whether
the
conduct
that
is
alleged
in
fact
meets
the
broadcast
music
standards,
that
it
is
plainly
anticompetitive,
it
is
the
kind
of
conduct
that
by
its
very
nature--
ms.
catherine
g.
o'sullivan
--if
there
are
factual
disputes,
then
summary
judgment
may
not
be
appropriate.
i
think
the
question
of
what
has
been
proven
is
not
necessarily
the
same
question
as
the
quick
look,
what
one
needs
to
know.
ms.
catherine
g.
o'sullivan
the
quick
look
is
a
tool
that
i
think
can
help
a
trial
court
faced
with
a
case
where
there
are
conflicts
in
the
facts,
and
therefore
summary
judgment
is
not
appropriate
to
shape
the
issues
for
trial.
it
can
help
to
determine
what
issues
would
be
relevant
at
trial
and
what--
ms.
catherine
g.
o'sullivan
--it
may
be
necessary
to
go
to
trial
even
if
one
applies
a
per
se
rule.
it
may
be
necessary
to
prove
that
what
is
alleged
was
in
fact
committed.
that
may
be
a
separate
issue.
but
it
would
help
the
court,
for
example,
if
there
were
a
dispute
of
fact
as
to
what
was
done,
it
would
help
the
court
to
narrow
the
issues
in
advance
to
say
that
if
it
is
proved
at
trial
that
this
conduct,
which
is
facially
anticompetitive
and
for
which
there
are
no
plausible
deficiency
defenses,
is
proven
at
trial,
then
that
will
be
per
se
illegal.
that
kind
of
analysis
could
be
done--
ms.
catherine
g.
o'sullivan
--in
our
view,
there
is
not
enough
to
determine...
there
is
not
enough
to
justify
a
conclusion
that
the
conduct
was
per
se
illegal.
we
took
the
position
that
it
was
inappropriate
to
grant
summary
judgment
to
the
defendant
because
we
think
that
the
plaintiff
did
place
in
issue
the
question
of
the
effect
on
its
ability
to
compete,
and
the
purpose,
the
competitive
effect
of
a
purpose
with
respect
to
excluding
dual
distributors.
we
think
that
there
was
enough
of
a
conflict
in
the
evidence
that
it
was
inappropriate
to
grant
summary
judgment.
ms.
catherine
g.
o'sullivan
we
think
the
district
court
was
certainly
justified
in
concluding
that
on
the
evidence
before
it
at
that
time,
plaintiff
was
not
entitled
to
judgment
or
a
per
se
theory.
we
think
it
was
therefore
for
the
same
reason
inappropriate
for
the
court
of
appeals
to--
ms.
catherine
g.
o'sullivan
--your
honor,
i
think
our
disagreement
with
the
court
of
appeals
goes
to
more
than
just
the
amount
of
evidence
in
the
record.
the
court
of
appeals
did
in
fact
talk
about
impairing
the
ability
to
compete,
but
their
reasoning
was
that
rebates
had
been
denied,
but
those
were
an
economic
benefit.
the
court
did
not
purport
to
determine
the
significance
of
that
economic
benefit,
did
not
purport
to
determine
that
denying
that
economic
benefit
would
have
the
effect
of
excluding
a
competitor
from
the
market
or
excluding
some
sort
of
competitive
practice.
it
simply
noted
the
obvious,
that
they
are
an
economic
benefit,
said
that
denying
an
economic
benefit
necessarily
impedes
to
some
degree,
necessarily
impairs
to
some
degree
the
ability
to
compete,
and
that
therefore
this
was
a
per
se
illegal
group
boycott.
in
our
view,
that
was
not
sufficient.
ms.
catherine
g.
o'sullivan
i
think
certainly
on
the
record
if
there
were
no
more
than
we
have
in
this
case,
it
would
be
accurate
to
say
that
there
is
no
way
one
could
determine--
ms.
catherine
g.
o'sullivan
--indeed,
if
one
could
not
get
to
the
point
where
the
record
showed
that
it
was
facially
anticompetitive
and
by
its
nature
would
tend
to--
ms.
catherine
g.
o'sullivan
--certainly,
your
honor,
that
is
a
possibility,
and
if
one
cannot
determine
at
any
earlier
stage,
such
as
summary
judgment,
that
the
conduct
is
or
is
not
facially
anticompetitive,
one
would
indeed
need
to
move
on
to
a
more
extensive
inquiry
at
trial.
thank
you.
