mr.
david
j.
sweeney
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
the
petitioner
northwest
wholesale
stationers
is
a
non-profit
purchasing
cooperative.
it
pools
the
collective
buying
ability
of
its
members
to
achieve
larger
aggregate
purchases,
thus
lowering
prices
to
its
members.
at
year
end,
what
would
be
profits
are
distributed
to
its
members
as
rebates,
which
are
exempt
from
being
categorized
as
price
discrimination
under
the
robinson-patman
act.
the
members
of
the
cooperative
are
retail
stationery
stores
located
throughout
the
five
western
states.
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
which
demonstrates
what
market
impact
or
power
the
cooperative
had
or
in
fact
the
definition
of
what
the
market
is.
the
respondent
pacific
stationery
is
a
wholesaler-retailer
combination,
and
used
its
cooperative
membership
for
purchases
of
odd
lot
and
round
out
items
when
it
could
not
stock
them
in
its
own
wholesale
inventory.
it
had
additional
sources
of
supply
from
manufacturers
and
other
suppliers.
after
pacific's
ownership
changed,
it
filed
another
membership
application.
that
application
was
denied,
although
they
were
informed
that
they
could
continue
to
purchase
from
the
cooperative.
pacific
then
filed
a
sherman
one
antitrust
lawsuit
alleging
that
a
group
boycott
had
occurred,
that
its
denial
of
cooperative
membership
in
the
absence
of
a
due
process
hearing
constituted
a
per
se
violation
under
liability
theory
based
on
silver
versus
the
new
york
stock
exchange.
at
the
district
court
level
on
cross
motions
for
summary
judgment,
the
district
court
dismissed
plaintiff's
claim,
reasoning
that
pacific
failed
to
submit
any
evidence
showing
a
restraint
on
competition
as
distinguished
from
alleged
unilateral
harm
to
itself.
the
ninth
circuit,
in
a
divided
opinion,
reversed,
finding
per
se
liability
for
the
cooperative's
actions.
it
stated
that
termination
in
the
absence
of
a
hearing
made
the
practice
so
likely
to
be
anticompetitive
that
it
was
per
se
unreasonable.
our
petition
followed.
the
recent
decisions
of
this
court
make
it
clear
that
under
either
a
rule
of
reason
or
a
per
se
analysis,
the
goal
is
to
form
a
judgment
about
the
competitive
significance
of
conduct,
that
courts
must
view
the
purpose
and
effect
on
competition.
the
ninth
circuit
should
be
reversed
because
it
found
per
se
liability
under
a
simplistic
analysis
which
simply
characterized
the
conduct
instead
of
viewing
what
actual
effect,
if
any,
the
conduct
had.
in
recent
cases,
this
court
has
authorized
the
use
of
an
analysis
of
competitive
impact:
what
is
the
economic
reality
which
occurred
as
a
result
of
the
conduct?
mr.
david
j.
sweeney
the
district
court
in
its
oral
opinion
made
no
specific
findings
of
fact
or--
mr.
david
j.
sweeney
--your
honor,
yes,
there
is.
the
only
factual
impact
in
the
record
is
the
loss
of
rebate,
which
amounted
to
approximately
$9,800.
that
was
the
$9,800
in
its
last
year
with
the
cooperative.
so
the
record
would
reflect
that
in
fact
a
rebate
had
been
lost.
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
that
would
indicate
what
effect
the
loss
of
that
rebate
had
on
pacific
unilaterally
as
a
competitor.
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
to
demonstrate--
mr.
david
j.
sweeney
--i
believe
that
there
would
be,
because
we
submit
that
it
must
be
the
plaintiff's
burden
to
show
in
fact
what
competitive
impact
has
occurred.
if
they
fail
to
set
forward
any
evidence
as
to
an
impact
on
competition
itself,
then
that
absence
of
material
from
the
record
would
allow
the
court,
faced
with
a
summary
judgment
motion,
to
conclude
that
there
had
been
no
meaning
of
the
burden
of
proof
on--
mr.
david
j.
sweeney
--i
would...
arguably,
although
i
would
submit
that
there
must
be
a
showing
of
an
impact
on
competition
to
act
as
a
predicate
for
any
antitrust
injury,
so
that
if
in
fact
there
was
no
showing
of
anticompetitive
injury,
then
antitrust
liability
would
not
follow
from
that.
facing
liability,
as
we
submit
the
ninth
circuit
did,
on
rank
characterization
ignores
the
competitive
impact,
and
in
terms
of
economic
policy
will
deter
pro-competitive
conduct
by
cooperatives.
here
the
plaintiff
made
no
showing
that
membership
in
the
cooperative
was
a
prerequisite
or
necessary
to
compete
in
the
marketplace.
the
plaintiff
was
not
foreclosed
from
any
supply...
it
had
multiple
sources
of
supply
from
manufacturers
and
other
wholesalers...
nor
was
it
foreclosed
from
any
markets
in
the
competition.
nothing
in
the
record
indicates
that
the
cooperative
northwest
possesses
any
significant
market
power
in
an
industry
which
in
fact
has
been
characterized
as
fragmented.
it
is
in
a
retail
industry.
because
there
was
no
showing
by
the
plaintiff
of
an
impact
on
competition
as
distinguished
from
an
impact
on
itself,
the
district
court
correctly
dismissed
the
suit
and
correctly,
we
submit,
utilized
the
rule
of
reason.
we
believe
it
is
now
appropriate
for
this
court
to
clarify
the
method
for
appropriately
analyzing
concerted
refusals
to
deal.
we
submit
that
lower
court
decisions
reflect
a
continuing
uncertainty
regarding
how
they
approach
a
group
boycott
case.
lower
courts
realize
that
when
they
engage
in
a
strict
characterization
of
conduct,
it
may
thrust
a
defendant
into
the
maw
of
a
per
se
violation
when
it
may
be
obvious
that
the
purpose
and
intent
of
the
conduct
was
not
a
naked
restraint.
mr.
david
j.
sweeney
i
believe
that
there
are
a
number
of
factors
which
would
take
it
at
least
out
of
the
traditional
paradigm
of
consorted
refusal
to
deal.
certainly
we
have
joint...
we
have
a
joint
grouping
of
competitors.
mr.
david
j.
sweeney
traditionally
yes.
i
think
the
answer
is
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
david
j.
sweeney
well,
i
guess...
let
me
back
up.
no,
your
honor.
i
will
change
my
mind,
because
there
are
a
number
of
factors
involved.
this
is
a
cooperative
that
has
membership
scattered
throughout
five
western
states.
i
believe...
it
is
hard
for
me
to
conceive
that--
mr.
david
j.
sweeney
--it
may
very
well
be.
our
point--
mr.
david
j.
sweeney
--i
hope
so.
we
believe
that
simply
because
you
have
an
aggregation
of
economic
units
that
may
be
classified
as
a
joint
grouping,
that
that
is
not
the
end
of
the
analysis,
and
in
fact
you
must
show
some
competitive
impact.
the
effect
of
the
cooperative
was
really
more
of
a
singular
acting
as
a
wholesaler.
it
was
really
in
essence
a
vertical
relationship
between
northwest
acting
in
its
capacity
as
a
wholesaler.
there
certainly
can
be
no
showing
that
a
small
retailer
in
montana
competed
with
pacific,
which
operated
in
downtown
portland.
so
we
would
in
essence,
your
honor,
characterize
the
basic
nature
of
the
case,
although
it
certainly
was
analyzed
as
a
concerted
refusal
to
deal,
although
the
district
court
stated
that
he
didn't
believe
it
was
appropriate
to
consider
it
as
a
group
boycott.
we
believe
the
lower
courts,
in
line
with
the
court's
recent
decision,
should
now
be
given
the
tools
of
analysis
for
a
joint
venture
or
joint
actions,
so
that
a
trial
court
can
deter
truly
anticompetitive
conduct
without
risking
harm
to
joint
conduct
which
is
procompetitive.
the
courts
already
recognize
that
boycotts
are
not
a
unitary
phenomenon.
as
a
starting
point,
this
court
could
confirm
that
not
all
conduct
which
definitionally
could
be
called
a
concerted
refusal
to
deal,
is
deserving
of
per
se
treatment.
this
will
free
lower
courts
from
the
shackles
of
characterization
so
that
they
can
roll
up
their
sleeves
and
really
get
down
to
the
job
at
hand,
and
that
is
seeing
what
conduct
is
truly
anticompetitive.
how
do
they
do
that?
we
would
submit
that
in
line
with
the
court's
opinion
in
gt
sylvania,
followed
up
last
term
by
jefferson
parish
and
ncaa,
the
trial
court
could
make
a
threshold
analysis
of
competitive
impact,
which
may
likely
require
a
market
definition
before
characterizing
the
conduct
as
rule
of
reason
or
that
which
would
merit
per
se
condemnation.
mr.
david
j.
sweeney
it
could
fit
nicely
there,
under
a
motion
for
partial
summary
judgment.
it
could
in
fact
be
utilized
as
a
tool
at
a
pretrial
level
for
narrowing
the
issues
that
the
trial
court
has
to
deal
with.
this
may
aid
the
district
court
or
the
trial
judge
in
focusing
on
whether
or
not
a
rule
of
reason
trial
is
appropriate.
it
could
be
done
on
a
partial
summary
judgment
basis.
conceivably,
a
motion
to
dismiss.
in
fact,
there
was
absolutely
no
showing
of
anticompetitive
impact.
the
trial
court
could
in
fact
call
a
conference
at
some
stage
and
request
that
the
issue
of
anticompetitive
impact
be
briefed.
mr.
david
j.
sweeney
i
see
it
can
be
utilized
in
that
function
and
at
that
level
so
that
he
could
funnel
down
this
important
issue.
it
could
also
be,
if
the
issues
were
not
focused,
if
the
litigants
for
some
reason
did
not
want
to
file
motions,
it
could
be
used...
the
trial
court
could
indicate
that
the
first
portion
of
the
trial
should
be
devoted
to
some
showing.
and
if
in
fact
there
was
a
showing
of
anticompetitive
impact,
the
burden
of
going
forward
would
then
shift
to
the
defendant
to
explain
what
his
reason
is,
if
there
is
some
plausible
efficiency-enhancing
argument
that
exists,
and
if
there
is,
then
it
would
be
appropriate
to
analyze
it
under
a
rule
of
reason
basis.
if
he
can't
come
forward
with
any
plausible
efficiency-enhancing
argument,
then
in
fact
per
se
condemnation
may
be
appropriate,
but
at
that
point
when
the
plaintiff
meets
his
burden
of
going
forward
and
showing
that
there
is
some
anticompetitive
impact,
then
the
defendant
should
be
given
the
opportunity
to
say
why
he
engaged
in
this
conduct,
and
if
in
fact
there
is
a
plausible
argument
for
it,
then
a
rule
of
reason
trial
should
ensue
so
that
whatever
restraint
exists
can
be
balanced
against
the
pro-competitive
arguments
that
the
defendant
may
have.
if
you
apply
that
test
here,
we
submit
that
the
only
evidence
in
the
record
is
a
nominal
loss
of
year-end
rebates
by
the
plaintiff
pacific.
a
threshold
analysis
would
demonstrate
that
no
pernicious
market
effects
did
or
were
likely
to
occur.
it
was
not
foreclosed
from
any
source
of
supply,
including
the
cooperative.
on
the
record,
the
loss
of
rebates
were
the
only
damage
element
the
president
of
pacific
knew
of,
and
stated
that
it
was
impossible
to
give
any
specific
examples
of
how
the
loss
of
those
rebates
would
affect
it
pricing
policy
or
damage
it.
all
this
was
in
the
context
of
a
fragmented
industry
spread
over
five
different
states,
where
there
has
been
no
showing
that
the
cooperative
possessed
any
market
power
or
leverage
to
enforce
its
will
or
to
preclude
the
plaintiff
from
any
markets.
we
submit
that
even
if
you
saw
anticompetitive
impact,
that
it
was
the
function
of
vital
self-regulation
by
cooperatives.
cooperatives
must
engage
in
some
self-regulation
in
order
to
become
more
efficient.
we
had
a
rule,
the
cooperative
had
a
rule
which
required
notification
of
change
of
ownership
within
15
days
after
that
ownership
changed.
now,
this
is
a
basic
and
an
important
rule
for
a
cooperative.
the
cooperative
simply
must
know
who
in
fact
its
owners
are.
a
change
in
ownership
could
signal
a
change
in
credit
history,
could
signal
a
change
in
buying
patterns.
the
cooperative's
efficiencies
would
be
sacrificed
if
its
credit
and
buying
policies
had
to
be
made
in
the
absence
of
actual
knowledge
of
who
was
doing
the
paying
and
who
was
doing
the
buying.
now,
the
ninth
circuit
applied
silver
versus
new
york
stock
exchange,
and
really
went
off
on
a
due
process
theory
that
held
that
it
required
self-regulation.
now,
silver
requires
self-regulation
as
a
result
of
the
securities
and
exchange
act.
the
robinson-patman
act
does
not
hint
that
the
cooperatives
of
this
country
should
engage
in
self-regulation.
absent
self-regulation,
there
is
absolutely
no
reason
even
under
silver
that
a
due
process
hearing
should
occur.
the
lower
court's
ruling
should
be
reversed,
and
this
court
can
now
make
it
clear
that
group
boycotts
or
any
joint
economic
action
should
be
analyzed
on
the
basis
of
its
competitive
impact
rather
than
its
label.
based
on
the
record
in
this
case,
no
impact
has
been
shown,
and
the
district
court's
order
of
dismissal
should
be
reinstated.
alternatively--
mr.
david
j.
sweeney
--they
said
that,
your
honor,
but
there
is
no
reasoning
behind
that
statement.
mr.
david
j.
sweeney
they
were
denied
the
ability--
mr.
david
j.
sweeney
--i
believe
it
is
an
unsupported
inference,
your
honor.
the
loss
of
a
rebate
is
something
that--
mr.
david
j.
sweeney
--they
held
that,
but--
mr.
david
j.
sweeney
--in
essence,
where
we
submit
the
ninth
circuit
went
afoul,
your
honor,
is
that
they
made
no
competitive
impact
analysis,
and
we
believe
it
is--
mr.
david
j.
sweeney
--beyond
simply--
mr.
david
j.
sweeney
--really,
beyond
saying
that
there
was
a
lack
of--
mr.
david
j.
sweeney
--well,
we
submit
that
they
also
relied
on--
mr.
david
j.
sweeney
--we
want
an
analysis,
your
honor,
of
what
in
fact
happened
on
competition,
how
the
loss
of
a
rebate
affected
pacific,
and
there
was
no
discussion
of
that.
we
believe
it
was
a
conclusory
opinion.
we
submit
that
the
decision
of
the
ninth
circuit
should
be
reversed.
mr.
david
j.
sweeney
briefly,
your
honor.
i
believe
that
the
respondent
is
trying
to
characterize
and
try
a
case
before
this
court
that
was
never
tried
below.
they
are
trying
to
attempt
to
argue
and
try
a
classic
group
boycott
case
when
it
was
clear
that
below
the
liability
theory
was
based
on
silver
versus
new
york
stock
exchange
and
a
due
process
theory.
the
record
simply
does
not
support
an
inference
of
increased
inventory,
of
expanded
warehousing,
anticompetitive
animus,
reasoning
for
the
action,
and
in
fact
if
there
is
any
inference
or
any
equivocation
on
the
record,
what
the
ninth
circuit
did
was
grant
summary
judgment
on
the
basis
of
liability
against
northwest,
so
before
this
court,
any--
mr.
david
j.
sweeney
--the
record
reflects
that
that
was
discussed.
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
david
j.
sweeney
we
are
on
summary
judgment.
mr.
david
j.
sweeney
no,
we
would...
it
is
not
on
this
case,
your
honor,
whether--
mr.
david
j.
sweeney
--well,
if
there
is
an
inference
there
on
a
summary
judgment
record,
those
inferences
at
this
court
have
to
be
weighed
most
favorably
with
northwest,
since
summary
judgment
was
rendered
against
northwest--
mr.
david
j.
sweeney
--what
we
are
saying
for--
mr.
david
j.
sweeney
--no.
what
we
take
is
a
fallback
position,
your
honor,
that
if
the
court--
mr.
david
j.
sweeney
--if
the
court
feels
that
the
record
is
equivocal
or
not
strong
enough,
we
submit
the
inferences,
if
there
are,
should
be
accorded
to
northwest,
and
that
the
case
should
be
reversed
and
remanded
for
decision
by
the
trial
judge.
we
submit
that
the
sherman
act,
if
there
is
no
showing
of
necessity,
would
not
require
a
blanket
open
admission
to
a
cooperative.
there
are
a
number
of
different
reasons.
a
cooperative,
just
in
terms
of
economic
size,
may
not
be
able
to
handle
an
open
admission
basis.
mr.
david
j.
sweeney
just
in
the
abstract,
your
honor?
mr.
david
j.
sweeney
the
exclusion
of
a
wholesaler-retailer
combination
i
think
can
be
justified
economically
on
a
number
of
different
grounds.
a
wholesaler
will
always
have
the
ability
to
purchase
because
of
its
wholesaling
ability
at
the
same
level
that
the
cooperative
would,
so
that
the
the
wholesaler-retailer
combination,
it
can
feed
that
retailer
through
its
wholesaling
arm,
whereas
going
through
the
cooperative
will
simply
increase
any
transaction's
cost.
what
that
does,
and
the
record
does
show
this,
that
the
wholesaler-retailer
combination
here
bought
in
odd
lot,
small
quantity
items.
now,
a
cooperative
really
lives
and
dies
by
getting
bulk
aggregate
purchases.
it
relies
on
its
members
who
traditionally
buy
through
the
cooperative,
day
in
and
day
out,
high
prices,
low
prices.
what
a
wholesaler-retailer
combination
will
do
is
simply
take
those
small
items
that
it
happens
to
run
out
of,
increasing
the
transaction
cost
from
the
cooperative,
because
they
have
to
engage
in
more
stocking
and
other
kinds
of
things,
and
not
improve
its
efficiencies.
thank
you.
