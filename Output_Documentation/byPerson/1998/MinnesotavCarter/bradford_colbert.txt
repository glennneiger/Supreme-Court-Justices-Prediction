mr.
bradford
colbert
right.
mr.
bradford
colbert
actually,
that
was
a
matter
of
much
discussion
during
the
hearing,
is
that
they
did
not
admit
that
that's
how
the
blinds
were.
mr.
bradford
colbert
there
has
been
no
findings
regarding
that--
mr.
bradford
colbert
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
bradford
colbert
if
you'll
look
at
exhibit
i
2--
mr.
bradford
colbert
--i
2...
excuse
me,
exhibit
9
on
page
i
2
of
the
joint
appendix,
you
can
see...
i
think
this
represents,
if
you
look
at
the
bottom
of
the
building,
there's
a
little
window
there,
and
then
there's
a
bicycle.
what
the
officer
looked
into
was
the
next
set
of
windows.
mr.
bradford
colbert
exactly
right,
your
honor,
under
the
balcony
behind
the
bushes.
the
bushes
are
approximately
3
to
4
feet
away,
which
answers
justice
souter's
question,
yes,
he
had
to
get
between
the
bushes
and
the
window.
mr.
bradford
colbert
i
think
the
bushes
will
protect
you
from
looking
into
these
windows.
mr.
bradford
colbert
but
in
this
case
these
officers
went
over
the
bushes,
which
is
what
the
minnesota
supreme
court
found,
crawled
over
the
bushes
to
get
to
these
windows,
and
so
i
think
it's
clear
that
these
bushes
were
protected...
were
put
there
so
you
would
not
walk
by
these
windows.
mr.
bradford
colbert
the
lawn
is
a
big
lawn
in
front,
but
these
bushes
are
protecting
this
particular
window,
and
i
think--
mr.
bradford
colbert
--right,
and
i
think
the
angle
depends
on
it,
if
you're
looking
at--
mr.
bradford
colbert
--that's
correct.
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
bradford
colbert
it's
not
clear
to
me,
and
this
picture
was
not
taken...
because
this
was
obviously
taken
during
the
day,
and
the
search
itself
took
place
at
night,
and
the
other
part
of
it--
mr.
bradford
colbert
--they're
horizontal--
mr.
bradford
colbert
--they're
horizontal
leveler
blinds,
and
they're
the
plastic
type,
and--
mr.
bradford
colbert
--yes.
mr.
bradford
colbert
yes,
and
if
you're
familiar
with
them,
as
they
get
old,
there
tends
to
be
gaps
in
them,
but
if
you
look
at
some
of
the
pictures
you
can
see
that
you
cannot
see
in
those
blinds
unless
you
are
12
inches
away.
it's
not
a
matter
of...
as
your
honor
was
pointing
out,
of
simply
walking
by.
you
have
to
be
very
close
to
look
in
there,
and
the
officer
didn't
simply
look
in
there.
he
looked
in
there
for
a
period
of
15
minutes.
he
was
constantly
changing
his
position
so
he
could
see,
and
look
in
there,
so
it's
a
completely
different
story
than
if
he
had
been
walking
by--
mr.
bradford
colbert
--i
think--
mr.
bradford
colbert
--no,
your
honor.
mr.
bradford
colbert
i
think
the
standard
should
be
if
it's
not
a
place
the
public--
mr.
bradford
colbert
--i
think
the
courts
have
held
that
if
the
officer
is
not
in
a
position
where
the
public
expects
him
to
be.
i
think
that's
what
this
decision
in
florida
v.
riley
held.
mr.
bradford
colbert
it
doesn't
matter.
if
the
public...
he's
not
in
a
position
where
the
public
expects
him
to
be.
mr.
bradford
colbert
that's
correct.
mr.
bradford
colbert
that's
correct,
your
honor.
i
think
one
of
the
big
differences
there
is
the
idea
that
it's
a
house,
not
a
barn,
and
this
court
has
clearly
emphasized
the
difference
in
privacy
between
looking
into
a
barn
and
looking
into
a
house.
mr.
bradford
colbert
if
the
officer
had
walked
across
open
fields
and
looked
into
a
house,
i
think
that
would
be
a
violation
of
the
fourth
amendment.
mr.
bradford
colbert
the...
florida
v.
riley
discusses
looking
into
curtilage,
and
in
florida
v.
riley
this
court
discusses
looking...
not
looking
into
the
house.
mr.
bradford
colbert
it
follows
from
florida
v.
riley.
distinguishing
between
looking
into
curtilage
and
looking
into
a
house.
the
cases
that
have
discussed
when
officers
have
looked
into
different
areas,
they
emphasize
that
this
is
not
looking
into
a
home,
so
i
think
they
follow--
mr.
bradford
colbert
--yes,
your
honor.
i
think
that...
excuse
me...
this
court
has--
mr.
bradford
colbert
--yes.
this
court
has
clearly
emphasized
the
protection
to
be
provided
by
the
home.
mr.
bradford
colbert
this
courts
have
held
that
you
have
to
exhibit
a
subjective
expectation
of
privacy.
if
the
blinds
are
a
third
up,
i
don't
think...
i...
then
you
would
have
not
exhibited
a
subjective--
mr.
bradford
colbert
--in
this
case,
where
defendants
closed
the
blinds
as
much
as
they
could,
that's...
they
clearly
evidenced
a
subjective
expectation
of
privacy.
mr.
bradford
colbert
then
your
expectation
of
privacy
would
not
be
reasonable.
mr.
bradford
colbert
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
bradford
colbert
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
bradford
colbert
no,
your
honor.
this
is
not
a
case
where--
mr.
bradford
colbert
--i
think
so,
your
honor.
the...
in
this
case
the
defendants
were
invited
guests
in
a
home.
in
rakas,
they
emphasized
the
lessened
expectation
of
privacy
in
a
car.
the
fact
that
they
were
in
a
home
increases
the
expectation
of
privacy.
they
also
took
measures
to
protect
their
privacy,
which
is
another
important
factor
in
consideration.
mr.
bradford
colbert
in
that
case,
your
honor,
the
police
have--
mr.
bradford
colbert
--yes,
your
honor.
in
that
case,
the
pizza
man
first
of
all
probably
would
not
have
taken
steps
to
preserve
their
privacy,
so
no,
in
that
case
the
pizza
man
would
not
have
an
expectation
of
privacy,
even
though
he
would
have
been
legitimately
on
the
premises.
mr.
bradford
colbert
no,
your
honor.
i
think
what
the
host
does
also
includes
you...
what
the
host
does
is
very
important,
because
what
evolves--
mr.
bradford
colbert
--there
is
no
distinction.
one
of
the
reasons
i
say
that
is
because
when
the
fourth
amendment
was
brought
about
there
was
no
distinction
between
your
business
and
home.
your
business
was
in
your
home,
and
the
fact
that
there
was
some
business
going
on
in
your
home
should
not
make
your
home
not
a
home.
in
these
days,
we're
using
our
homes
more
for
businesses.
we're
telecommuting
from
home.
to
lose
your
privacy
because
some
business
is
transacted
in
your
home
just
doesn't...
doesn't
follow
from
history,
and
it
isn't
the
way
it
should
be
headed.
mr.
bradford
colbert
in
this
case
because
invitees
were
with
the
resident
of
the
apartment.
in
some
places
it
may
not
be
that
way,
but
in
this
case
what
makes
a
difference
is
that
they
were
working
with
the
resident
of
the
apartment.
they
were
engaged
in
a
common
task
with
the
resident
of
the
apartment.
mr.
bradford
colbert
i
think
that's
answered
by
this
court's
decision
in
arizona
v.
hicks.
he
should
have
done
more
investigation.
mr.
bradford
colbert
but
without
violating
the
minnesota
statute,
without
violating
the
privacy.
he
could
have
tried
to
determine
if...
some
way
to
determine
the
informant's
veracity.
mr.
bradford
colbert
i
could
ask
how
he
knew
this
information.
mr.
bradford
colbert
and
then
he
could
have
staked
out
the
apartment,
which
is
what
they
did
after
the
officer
looked
into
the
apartment.
they
could
stake
out
the
apartment
to
see...
and
if
these
people
had
left
the
apartment,
the
informant
told
them
there
was
a
car,
so
there
would
be
some
basis
to
determine
the
veracity
of
the
informer's
information.
this
court
has
held
a
number
of
times
that
simply
anonymous
tips
do
not...
are
not
sufficient--
mr.
bradford
colbert
--that's
not
true,
and...
well,
i
think
it's...
an
example
would
be
if
the
informant
guessed
at
the
apartment.
so
under
the
circumstances
the
officer,
if
this
is
not
a
search
the
officer
could
have
looked
into
every
single
window
of
the
apartment
to
determine
which
apartment
the
informant
was
talking
about.
that's
the
problem
with
calling
this
not
a
search,
because
there
is
no
limit
upon
what
the
officer
could
have
done.
the
officer
could
have
looked
at
every
single
apartment
to
see
if
this
was
indeed
the
drug
dealing
apartment.
everyone's
privacy
in
that
apartment
building
would
have
been
invaded
by
the
officer.
this
court
has
drawn
a
firm
line--
mr.
bradford
colbert
--i'm
saying,
if
this
court
determines
that
this
is
not
a
search,
the
officer
could
have
walked
within
12
inches
of
every
apartment
here
and
looked
through
closed
blinds
to
determine
what
was
going
on
in
that
apartment,
whether...
whatever
intimate
activities
of
the
home--
mr.
bradford
colbert
--they
were
closed.
there
was
a
gap
in
the
blinds,
but
they
were
closed.
the
state
has
attempted
to
defeat
the
defendant's
standing
by
claiming
that
the
criminal
activity
somehow
defeats
the
idea
of
standing.
mr.
bradford
colbert
it's
a
two
step
analysis.
it's
substantive
fourth
amendment.
mr.
bradford
colbert
that's
correct.
mr.
bradford
colbert
that's
correct,
your
honor.
after
rakas
this
court
does
not
discuss
that
any
more.
they
have
said
that
he
has
no
expectation
of
privacy
because
of
the
criminal
activity
going
on
in
his
house.
mr.
bradford
colbert
the
bottom
line
is,
when
looking
into
a
home,
any
kind
of
intrusion
into
a
home,
unless
there
are
exigent
circumstances
there
should
be
a
warrant,
especially
when
you
have
to
go
through
the
contortions
that
this
officer
had
to
go
through
to
intrude
upon
the
privacy
of
the
home,
so
that
is
this
court's
bottom
line,
and
that
is
what
is
at
the
core
of
the
fourth
amendment.
mr.
bradford
colbert
unless
there
are
exigent
circumstances,
that
an
intrusion,
any
intrusion
to
the
home
should
be
accompanied
by
a
warrant.
mr.
bradford
colbert
there
is...
there
has
to
be
a
number
of
factors
that
need
to
be
considered,
and
the
factors
in
this
case
would
show
that
he
had
an
expectation
of
privacy
in
the
home.
the
defendants
had
an
expectation
of
privacy
because
they
were
invited
guests
into
the
home,
and
that
they
demonstrated
an
expectation
of
privacy
when
the
blinds
were
closed,
and
that
they
were
engaged.
and
finally--
mr.
bradford
colbert
--that's
correct.
mr.
bradford
colbert
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
bradford
colbert
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
bradford
colbert
when
they're
across
the
threshold
of
the
household,
that
is
a
factor.
and
i
think
it's
also--
mr.
bradford
colbert
--it's
not
necessarily
sufficient.
in
this
case,
one
important
factor
is
that
they
were
present
at
the
time
of
the
search.
mr.
bradford
colbert
there
is
some
indication
that--
mr.
bradford
colbert
--there
is
some
indication
in
that
one
of
the
defendants
had
slippers
on
at
the
time
the
officers
looked
into
the
window.
there's
an
affidavit
in
the
record
indicating
that
mr.
carter
had
a
key
to
the
apartment.
mr.
bradford
colbert
there
is
an
affidavit
in
the
record
indicating
that
mr.
carter,
one
of
the
defendants,
had
a
key
to
the
apartment.
the
officer
indicated
they
heard
them
discussing,
talking.
he
couldn't
say
what
he
heard
them
talking,
so...
and
the
fact
that
they
were
there
for
more
than
2
hours
indicates
that
this
may
have
been
more
than
a
business
invitee.
another
important
factor--
mr.
bradford
colbert
--that's
correct.
mr.
bradford
colbert
that's
a
factor,
and
consider
the
court
would
consider
that.
there
should
not
be
a
distinction,
as
i
said
before,
between
business
invitees
and
social
invitees.
you
invite
someone
into
your
house,
whatever
their
status,
and
that
goes
back
to
when
the
fourth
amendment
was
enacted.
their
are
differences
between
the
business
and
the
home,
there
just
were
no
differences,
so
to
make
that
distinction
would
be
contrary
to
history
of
the
fourth
amendment.
mr.
bradford
colbert
for
two
reasons.
mr.
bradford
colbert
first,
as
the
host,
i
want
to
share
my
privacy
with
my
guests.
if
i
invite
people
over
for
a
dinner
party,
be
it
for
2
hours,
i
want
to
share
my
privacy
with
them.
i...
my...
if
someone
were
to
intrude
upon
my
house
while
i'm
having
a
dinner
party,
it
would
not
just
be
offensive
to
me,
it
would
be
offensive
to
the
people
i
invited
over,
so
i
don't
think
it...
it's
not
necessary
that
it
be
an
overnight
to
be...
to
share
the
privacy.
as
a
guest,
i
want
to
have
an
expectation
of
privacy
when
i
go
to
someone's
house.
it's
different
than
meeting
someone
in
a
park.
if
you
plan
to
meet
someone
in
a
park,
there
is
no
expectation
of
privacy.
if
someone
were
to
invite
me
into
my
house,
that
carries
with
it
a
certain
expectation
of
privacy.
mr.
bradford
colbert
she...
if
they've
evidenced
no
subjective
expectation
of
privacy,
but
if
i'm
coming
over
to
discuss
life
insurance,
or
some
other
business
activity
that
may
be
an
intimate
activity,
that's
a
different
matter.
in
that
case
you
might
want
to
close
the
blinds.
you
might
want
to
have
privacy.
and
that's
why
it's
important
in
this
case
that
the
defendants
exhibited
an
expectation
of
privacy.
it
wasn't...
they
tried
to
shield
their
privacy
from
everyone.
mr.
bradford
colbert
correct,
it
was
not
in
the
supreme
court
opinion.
it's
a
part
of
the
district
court
record,
and
it's
attached
to
the
appendix.
i'm
not
sure
exactly
what
part
of
the
appendix.
mr.
bradford
colbert
no,
your
honor.
mr.
bradford
colbert
that
is
a
sound
reason,
your
honor,
and
it's,
i
think
because
they're
working
together
makes
it
even
more
sound.
mr.
bradford
colbert
no,
it
doesn't,
and
i
go
back
to
the
issue
of
having
exhibited
a
subjective
expectation
of
privacy.
there
may
be
some
circumstances
where
you
invite
the
pizza
man
in,
where
it's
important
that
you
have
some
private
interaction--
mr.
bradford
colbert
--no,
your
honor.
this
is...
in
this
case,
the
officers
intruded
upon
the
defendants'
privacy
because
when
they
looked
in
the
window
they
saw
the
defendants.
that's
what
makes
their
privacy
interest
at
stake.
thank
you.
