well,
given
the
reasoning
of
rakas,
would
it
be
fair
to
answer
justice
stevens
by
saying
this
isn't
a
standing
question
at
all,
it's
a
question
of
the
substantive
reach
of
the
fourth
amendment?
i
had
thought
that
the
chief,
then
justice
rehnquist,
in
writing
the
opinion
in
rakas,
went
into
this,
and
said
this
is
not
a
standing
question,
or
am
i
incorrect?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
yes,
but
that's
a
substantive
interpretation
of
the
fourth
amendment.
it
is
not
a
question
of
who
has
rights
to
raise
a
violation.
there's
a
slight
difference,
is
there
not?
i
thought
that
rakas
discussed
this.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
it
seems
to
me
that
what
you're
suggesting
is
what
we
might
call
a
multifactor
test,
and
it
may
be
almost
impossible
to
avoid
it,
but
that
the
government
tries
to
reach
a
higher
level
of
generality
and
say
that
there
is
just
no
legitimate
expectation
of
privacy
by
a
social
or
business
guest
in
a
home,
other
than
an
overnight
visitor.
i
guess
that's
it,
i
think
there's
a
difference
between
the
two
of
you
in
that
respect.
now,
maybe
on
analysis
we're
going
to
have
to
ask
the
government,
well,
how
do
you
know
it's
not
legitimate,
and
then
they'll
give
us
all
these
factors,
and
we'll
be
right
where
you
are.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
although
business
invitees
usually
are
entitled
to
a
higher
standard
of
care,
so...
even
in
the
law
of
torts,
so
we
would
be
reversing
it,
but
i
think
what
justice
o'connor
suggests
might
make
a
lot
of
sense
insofar
as
our
legitimate
expectations
of
privacy.
the
refrigerator
repairman
and
so
forth
are
limited
in
their
access
to
other
parts
of
the
premises,
and
it
seems
to
me
that
the
business
social
distinction
might
be
helpful
here,
as
justice
o'connor
suggests.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
how
would
you
answer
the
question
i
put
to
the
petitioner's
counsel?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what
is
the
difference
between
your
approach
and
the
state's
approach,
if
any,
in
your
briefs?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
does
frequency
of
visitation
enter
into
that
balance?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
related
status
between
the
party,
cousin
versus
friends?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--your
functional
equivalent
test
is
not
in
your
brief,
is
it?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is...
did--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--do
you
understand
justice
o'connor's
question
to
relate
to
the
window
to
the
immediate
left
of
the
door
and
to
the
right
of
the
bike,
or
to
the
double
windows
that
are
to
the
left
of
the
bike
and
under
the
balcony?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
2?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
the
windows
that
are
under
the
balcony.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
if
my
colleagues
are
ready
to
leave
the
bushes
and
the
blinds,
i
was
curious,
at
what
level
of
generality
do
you
say
we
should
evaluate
the
question
of
whether
there's
a
legitimate
claim
of
privacy?
are
you
suggesting...
you're
not
suggesting
that
we
repudiate
rakas,
or
are
you?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
are
we
propelled
necessarily
into
a
multifactor
case
no
matter
what
we
do?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
you
suggest
that
any
social
guest
has
that
expectation.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
excuse
me,
when
you
say
it's
a
factor.
i
don't--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--i'm
curious,
justice
o'connor
suggested
with
considerable
force,
it
seems
to
me,
that
we
might
draw
the
line
between
a
business
invitee
and
a
social
guest,
and
you
talk
about
social
guests
in
your
red
brief.
it's
not
clear
to
me
that
these
were
social
guests.
there's
nothing
in
the
record
to
indicate
that,
is
there,
other
than
the
fact
that
they
were
using
the
kitchen
to
chop
the
cocaine,
but--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--it
seems
to
me
these
were...
this
was
a
strictly
business
transaction.
there's
nothing
to
even
show
that
they
were
previously
acquainted.
they
might
have
been
introduced
by
intermediaries.
