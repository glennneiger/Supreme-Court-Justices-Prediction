justice
david
h.
souter
what
you're
saying,
aren't
you,
is
that
whenever
there
is
a
need
to
invoke
a
fourth
amendment
protection
this
factor
is
going
to
count
against
the
need?
i
mean,
the
only
time
people
raise
the
fourth
amendment
is
when
somebody
is
about
to
introduce
something
into
evidence
in
a
criminal
trial,
and
i
think
you're
saying
that
this
factor
always
counts
against
them
when
they
want
to
do
the
very
thing
that
the
law
allows
them
to
do
by
filing
a
suppression
motion.
justice
david
h.
souter
so
i
mean,
the
tendency
of
what
you're
saying
is
that
criminals
should
not
have
a
right
to
raise
fourth
amendment
issues
under
a
totality
test.
is
that--
justice
david
h.
souter
--then
tell
me
how
the
criminal
nature
of
the
activity
properly
counts
if
that
is
not
the
tendency
of
what
you're
arguing.
justice
david
h.
souter
oh,
i
thought
you
were
arguing
that
it
should
provide
a
burden,
as
it
were,
in
the
test.
you're
not
arguing
that
at
all.
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
justice
david
h.
souter
--mr.
backstrom,
you
said
a
moment
ago
at
the
beginning
of
your
argument
that
the
position
below
was
tantamount
to
the
readoption
of
the
automatic
standing
rule,
and
i'm
wondering
if
it
is.
isn't
there
a
distinction
to
be
drawn
between
this
notion
of
common
enterprise
that
there
would
be
standing
when
the
stranger,
when
the
guest
or
invitee
is
engaged
in
some
kind
of
a
common
activity
with
the
owner
of
the
dwelling
on
the
one
hand
and
on
the
other
hand
the
position
of
somebody
who
comes
in,
let's
say,
to
do
casual
labor,
fix
the
telephone,
the
burglar
who
happens
to
be
in
the
bedroom
when
the
police
arrive?
can't
a
line
be
drawn
there,
and
if
a
line
can
be
drawn,
isn't
the
rule
below
something
short
of
reestablishing
automatic
standing?
justice
david
h.
souter
what
about
a
line
i
suggested?
there's
something...
like
all
lines,
there
are
going
to
be
times
when
you're
going
to
have
difficulty
drawing
it,
but
there
is,
it
seems
to
me,
something
intuitively
different
about
three
people
sitting
around
a
table,
in
this
case
packaging
cocaine,
and
on
the
other
hand
the
individual
who
comes
in
to
fix
the
telephone,
who
really
is
simply
admitted
to
do
a
job
and
is
not
engaged
in
a
concerted
activity
with
the
homeowner.
isn't
that
a
line
that
could
be
drawn,
and
isn't
it
implicit
here?
justice
david
h.
souter
right.
justice
david
h.
souter
the
owner
of
the
apartment
was
engaging
in
the
business
activity
with
them.
i
think
the
three
of
them
were
engaged
in
sort
of
a
common
enterprise,
weren't
they?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
are
you
then
saying
the
reason
is
that
it
was
business,
whereas
if
it
had
been
a
criminal
enterprise
not
for
profit,
you
would
admit
the
distinction,
the
line
that
i
was
suggesting?
is
it
that
the
line
cannot
be
drawn,
or
that
you
shouldn't
draw
it
in
a
business
case
as
opposed
to
a
nonbusiness
enterprise,
or
a
nonbusiness
activity?
which
is
the
reason
for
your
answer?
justice
david
h.
souter
you
mean
if
they
play
five
times
a
week
they
get
standing,
if
they
play
once
a
week
they
don't?
justice
david
h.
souter
yes,
but
how
about
that
factor?
justice
david
h.
souter
i
understand
the
factual
difference,
but
i
don't
know
why
it
should
make
a
difference.
if
in
each
case
the
individual
is
invited
by
the
owner
to
engage...
i
guess
in
this
instance
i'm
sure
it's
a
lawful
activity.
justice
david
h.
souter
why
should
it--
justice
david
h.
souter
why
should
it
make
a
difference
whether
they
play
once
a
week,
or
three
or
four
or
five
times
a
week?
justice
david
h.
souter
i
know
you're
saying
i
have
to
look
at
it,
but
what
i'm
saying,
why
should
that
distinction
be
a
potential
source
of
difference?
justice
david
h.
souter
i
play
poker
once
a
week.
it
seems
to
me
i've
got
a
pretty
strong
personal
relationship
with
somebody.
justice
david
h.
souter
mr.
lamken,
your
argument
assumes
that
we
accept
the
conclusion
by
the...
i
guess
it
was
the
intermediate
appeals
court,
or
the
trial
court
in
minnesota
that
the
officer
was
not
within
the
curtilage.
as
i
understand
it,
the
supreme
court
of
minnesota
did
not
deal
with
that
issue,
is
that
correct?
justice
david
h.
souter
isn't
there
something
passing
strange
about
the
conclusion
that
the
officer
was
not
within
the
curtilage?
as
i
understand
the
facts,
although
you
speak
of
common
areas
and
areas
open
to
the
public,
the
officer
had
gone
up
next
to
the
building
between...
in
effect
between
the
building
and
the
shrubbery...
and
was
standing
there,
and
i
would
suppose
that
if
we
were
dealing
with
the
usual
one
family
house
we
would
say,
well,
of
course
that's
within
the
curtilage.
why
don't
we
say
it
in
the
case
of
an
apartment
building?
justice
david
h.
souter
yes,
but
he
wasn't...
as
i
understand
it,
he
wasn't
seeing
within
the
crack
of
the
blinds
as
he
crossed
the
lawn.
i
thought
as
the
briefs
described
the
facts
he
didn't
get
to
see
inside
until
he
had
positioned
himself
between
a
shrub
and
the
wall
of
the
building.
justice
david
h.
souter
was
he
between
the
shrubs
and
the
building
or
not?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
was
the
shrub--
justice
david
h.
souter
what
about--
justice
david
h.
souter
what
do
you
say
to
the
suggestion
of
great
significance
in
the
business
or
profit
making
versus
purely
social
distinction
here?
justice
david
h.
souter
you
haven't
given
it
yet,
and
it
may
not
be
sound,
but
i'd
be
interested
in
your
thoughts
on
it,
and
maybe
mr.
backstrom
could
comment
when
he
gets
back
up.
one
reason
you
might
want
to
afford
the
guests
the
standing
to
contest
here
is
not
merely
because...
and
as
a
reason
for
finding
that
reasonable,
is
not
merely
because
the
host
wants
to
share
the
host's
privacy,
but
because
the
host
wants
to
preserve
the
host's
own
privacy.
and
it's
quite
true
that
the
host
in
this
situation
will
have
standing
to
contest
the
search,
or
the
intrusion
if
there
is
one,
but
the
breach
of
privacy,
if
there
has
been
one,
will
have
been
complete,
whether
the
host
can
contest
it
later
or
not,
and
it
might
very
well
be
that
we
would
want
to
give
standing
to
the
guest
in
order
to
avoid,
as
it
were,
tempting
the
police
to
come
in
and
make
searches
which
will
necessarily
violate
the
privacy
of
the
owner.
is
that
a
sound
reason?
you
haven't
given
it,
and
maybe
there's
a
reason
for
not
getting
into
that.
justice
david
h.
souter
does
that
take
you
back
to
automatic
standing
of
jones?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
they
will
know,
as
they
did
here,
whether
there
are
persons
other
than
the
homeowner.
