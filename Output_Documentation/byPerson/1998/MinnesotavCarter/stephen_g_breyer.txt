what
are
we
driving
towards
with
these
tests?
in
my
own
mind,
perhaps
wrongly,
i've
used
the
spanish
expression,
mi
casa
es
su
casa...
my
house
is
yours...
and
insofar
as
that's
the
attitude,
there's
the
expectation
of
privacy,
and
insofar
as
it's
not,
there
isn't,
and
is
that
what
these
cases
seem
to
be
driving
towards?
when
we
invite
a
weekend
guest,
that's
what
we
say,
my
house
is
yours,
but
we
certainly
don't
say
that
with
a
business
visitor
normally,
and
perhaps
with
a
poker
player
it
depends
on
the
nature
of
the
game,
but
is
that
what
this
is
driving
towards?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
is
it,
if
it's
not
that?
that
is,
i'm
not
saying
who
has
the
intent.
i'm
saying,
do
the
circumstances
suggest
that's
what's
going
on,
my
house
is
yours.
now,
is
that
what
this
is
aiming
at,
yes
or
no?
it
is
or
it
isn't.
if
it
is,
fine.
if
it's
not,
what
are
these
tests
aiming
at.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why?
why
is
that?
i
mean,
i
thought
you
had
a
fairly
good
case
until
i
looked
at
two
exhibits.
once
i
looked
at
exhibit
10
which
is
the
same
as
exhibit
9,
i
take
it,
it
is
just
taken
from
a
different
angle,
and
then
i
looked
at
exhibit
8...
and
i'm
asking
you
this.
i'm
not...
i'm
going
to
sound
more
definite
than
i
am...
i
thought,
well,
this
is
just
a
basement
apartment.
i
mean...
i
lived
in
a
basement
apartment
once.
our
kitchen's
still
sort
of
underwater...
and
when
i'm
there,
i
know
that
if
you
don't
pull
the
blinds
the
right
way,
everybody
can
walk
in
and
look,
so
when
i'm
in
the
kitchen
when
i
used
to
live
in
that
basement
apartment,
i
assumed
i
had
to
pull
the
blinds.
now,
it's
true
that
in
my...
on
my
basement
apartment
was
about
2
feet
away
from
the
sidewalk,
but
i
thought
people
used
to
wander
by.
now,
i
look
at
this,
it
looks
about
the
same
to
me,
particularly
is
a
bicycle
behind
these
bushes.
what
bushes
did
he...
he
didn't
have
to
climb
over
any
bush,
just
walk
there,
and
it
sounds
as
if
bicycles
go
back
and
forth,
they
said.
so
why
wouldn't
you
expect,
if
you
live
in
that
apartment,
that
somebody
might
walk
by,
and
you'd
better
pull
the
blinds
the
right
way
because
if
you
pull
them
the
wrong
way
anybody
can
see
in.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
how
do
they
in
exhibit
10
protect
me?
suppose
i
start
here
on
the
left,
and
i
simply
walk
over
one
window,
two
windows,
three
windows,
there
i
am.
i
never
went
to
any
bushes.
i
mean,
i
grant
you
i
could
go
through
the
bushes,
or
i
might
not
go
through
the
bushes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why
did
the
officer...
just...
why
did
he
crawl
over
this
bush?
i
mean,
why
would
he
do
it?
i
mean,
the
bicycle's
right
there
between
the
path
and
the
wall.
why
did
he
crawl
over
a
bush?
why
didn't
he
just
walk?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
in
your
opinion
should
the
police
officer
have
done?
i
mean,
he's
standing
on
the
street,
i
take
it,
and
somebody
comes
up
to
him
and
he
says,
you
know,
i
was
just
looking
in
through
this
basement
window,
or
the
first
floor
window,
and
there
are
some
people
there
who
are
cutting
heroin
in
the
kitchen,
and
i
saw
them.
now,
what's
a
police
officer
supposed
to
do?
is
he--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
what
he
did.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
mean,
look,
the
person
walks
up
to
you,
say
you're
the
policeman.
he
says,
you
know,
i
was
just
walking
by
this
place,
and
there
are
some
people
downstairs,
and
they're
cutting
drugs.
i
just
saw
them.
all
right.
now...
now,
what
exactly
would
you
do
at
that
moment?
you're
the
perfect
policeman.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
he
says,
i
saw
it
in
the
window.
i
was
walking
by...
just
what
he
told
him.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--is
there
any
indication...
i
mean,
i...
if
we
go
back
to
a
man's
home
is
his
castle,
that's
the
saying
at
that
time,
right,
and
so
we
say
of
those
expectations
of
privacy
that
we
want
to
protect,
we
want
to
protect
that
person's
privacy,
the
one
who
owns
the
home
and
lives
there.
that's
his
castle.
but
why
do
we
want
to
protect
the
privacy
of
the
pizza
man
who
happens
to
be
delivering
the
pizza
to
the
kitchen,
any
more
than
we
want
to
protect
the
pizza
man
when
he's
in
his
cart
on
the
street,
or
when
he's
walking
door
to
door?
there's
no
doubt
we
want
to
protect
the
privacy
of
the
owner
of
the
house,
and
perhaps
his
guests,
to
whom
he
has
given...
now
i
get
a
little
lost.
that's
where
i
need
the
help.
why
is
it
that
we
want
to
protect
that
expectation
of
privacy
in
smith's
house
where
it's
not
smith
we're
protecting,
when
it's
jones,
the
pizza
man,
who's
come
inside?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
