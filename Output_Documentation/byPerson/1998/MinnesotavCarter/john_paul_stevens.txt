mr.
backstrom,
may
i
slow
you
down
a
minute
by
asking
you
a
question?
what
if
the
state
passed
a
statute...
i
remember
years
ago
there
was
a
debate
on
maybe
all
defendants
should
have
standing
to
challenge
fourth
amendment
violations,
and
what
if
a
state
passed
a
statute
and
said
that
the
defendant
shall
always
have
standing
to
object
to
an
unlawful
search
or
seizure?
do
you
think
such
a
statute
would
be
constitutional?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
know
the
fourth
amendment
was,
but
could
the
state
pass
a
statute
that
gave
additional
protection
to
a
defendant
without
violating
the
federal
constitution?
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
think
standing
is
always
a
federal
question?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
you
do
not
say
he
must
be
an
overnight
guest.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
also
it
could
be
a
commercial
arrangement.
suppose
it's
a
babysitter
who
comes
in,
never
spends
the
night
but
always
gets
paid
for
his
or
her
watching
of
the
children.
justice
john
paul
stevens
oh,
you
don't.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
the
drug
dealer
who
comes
once
a
week,
because
he
has
a
key
and
has
lunch
there,
is?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i'll
go
with
the
babysitter
over
the
drug
dealer.
justice
john
paul
stevens
now,
if
a
peeping
tom
looked
through
the
window
at
a
babysitter,
would
she
have
any...
could
she
be
classified
as
a
victim
in
terms
of
victim
impact
statements
and
all
the
rest?
would
she
be
a
victim
of
the
offense?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
she
would
not
be
a
victim
of
the
peeping
tom's
offense,
in
your
view?
justice
john
paul
stevens
a
rather
strange--
justice
john
paul
stevens
most
pizza
men
don't
get
past
the
front
door.
justice
john
paul
stevens
let
me
test
it
with
another
example.
under
your
view,
would
the
person
who's
been
in
the
house
often
enough
to
get
some
expectation
of
privacy,
but
never
visits
any
part
of
the
house
except
the
living
room,
have
standing
to
object
to
a
search
of
the
basement
or
the
attic?
justice
john
paul
stevens
going
back
to
the
facts
for
a
minute,
is
it
your
view
we
should
accept
the
facts
as
stated
in
the
minnesota
supreme
court's
opinion?
