justice

the
states
have
applied
various
standards
in
courts
to
determine
whether
there's
a
fourth
amendment
violation
with
regard
to
a
visitor
in
a
home
and,
as
i
look
at
the
cases,
they
seem
to
turn
quite
often
on
the
extent
to
which
the
visitor
has
control
over
the
premises.
a
visitor
who's
been
given
a
key
and
the
right
to
exclude
others
would
be
treated
much
like
the
homeowner,
but
someone
with
a
more
casual
contact
would
not.
i
find
the
totality
of
the
circumstances
test
pretty
vague.
do
you
place
any
reliance
on
the
control
test
that's
used
by
some
of
the
state
courts?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
maybe
the
line
should
be
business
versus
social.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
we're
dealing
with
a
business
transaction.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
the
apartment
occupant
was
to
get
a
certain
amount
of
the
cocaine
in
exchange
for
letting
them
use
the
premises.
justice
sandra

--mr.--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
lamken,
now
i'm
not
sure
we're
going
to
get
to
the
second
question,
but
if
we
did,
do
you
support
the
notion
that
a
police
officer
can
go
to
a
residence
with
a
closed
venetian
blind
and
stoop
down
to
peer
between
the
cracks,
8
inches
from
the
crack,
and
that's
perfectly
legitimate,
that's
okay?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
as
long...
your
position
is
that
as
long
as
it's
a
sidewalk
in
front
of
the
apartment
building
that
anyone
can
use,
then
they
can
squat
down,
peer
through
the
tiniest
crack
that
obviously
the
homeowner
has
hoped
to
exclude
prying
eyes
from.
that's
okay.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
isn't
it
rather
different
to
contemplate
a
police
officer
walking
by,
no
curtains
drawn,
and
you
can
see
in
the
open
window
and
see
what
you
see?
isn't
that
different
in
quality
and
nature
from
the
person
who,
faced
with
a
closed
blind,
scrunches
down
to
peer
through
the
crack?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
colbert,
as
long
as
we're
on
the
exhibits,
and
trying
to
ascertain
the
facts,
look
at
i
9--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--which
was
exhibit
39,
which
is
the
close
up
of
the
blind
in
question.
does
that
represent
how
it
was
on
the
occasion
at
issue?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
what
was
the
finding
of
the--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--so
we
don't
know
in
what
condition--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
if
you
look
at
exhibit
12,
i
5,
there's
no
obstruction
by
the
bushes
at
all.
i
mean,
anybody
could
walk
right
up.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
not
in
exhibit
12
they're
not.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
if
you
walked
up
from
that
side,
from
the
place
where
that
photo
was
taken,
there's
no
bush
in
between.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
one
other
question.
the
blinds.
was
it
a
venetian
blind,
or
one
of
those
bamboo
blinds
that
just
unrolls.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
what?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
plastic
venetian
style--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--blinds?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
do
you
say
that
any
enhancement
of
the
officer's
ability
to
observe
is
invalid?
for
instance,
the
officer
who,
in
order
to
see
in
a
yard,
gets
a
ladder
and
gets
up
on
it
to
look
in,
puts
the
ladder
on
the
sidewalk
and
looks
over
the
top?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
is
that
okay?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
no.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
maybe
that's
what
you
think
it
should
be.
what
do
you
think
in
fact
the
courts
have
held?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
he
puts
the
ladder
on
the
public
sidewalk.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
what
about
the
use
of
night
vision
glasses?
is
it
okay,
as
long
as
you
don't
train
them
on
the
house?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
in
your
view?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
do
you
think
the
pizza
delivery
man
has
an
expectation
of
privacy
when
he
walks
in
to
put
the
pizza
on
the
table?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
invited
in.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
just
can't
imagine
why
the
avon
lady
should
expect
something
different
when
she
sits
down
at
the
dining
table
to
show
the
products
and
the
catalogue
than
when
she's
out
on
the
front
step,
or
at
some
commercial
establishment.
i
just
don't
understand
why
that
should
change.
this
is
a
commercial
transaction.
there's
no
expectation
of
privacy
when
the
avon
lady
comes
in.
