justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--you
said
brief,
which
was
a
few
hours,
and
you
said
brief
time,
unlawful
purpose.
would
it
make
any
difference,
in
your
view
of
the
applicable
law,
if
they
had
gathered
to
play
a
game
of
poker
instead
of
to
put
together
coke,
or
whatever
they
were
doing?
would
that
have
made
a
difference?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you
wouldn't
know
about
whether
they
were
there
for
a
lawful
purpose
before
you
began
this
search,
so
it
can't
turn
on
the...
can
we
take
that
out
of
it,
whether
they're
there
to
play
poker
or
whether
they're
there
to
prepare
drugs?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
a
poker
player
that
doesn't
have
the
key
but
comes
every
week
to
play
the
game?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i've
given
you
the
case,
so
what
is
it?
the
poker
player
comes
for
the
game
but
doesn't
have
the
key,
can't
get
in
unless
the
occupant
of
the
premises
opens
the
door,
stays
for...
i
don't
know
how
long
these
sessions
run...
2
hours,
say.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
like
what?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--well,
there
wasn't--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
does
the
record
tell
us
that
it
was
that
they
were
careless
in
the
way
they
closed
the
blinds,
or
that
she
was
a
tenant
in
the
building,
that
they
did
the
best
they
could
with
the
blind
that
they
had?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
if
the
informer
had
violated
the
peeping
tom
statute...
leave
the
police
officer
out
of
it...
the
employer
who
scrunches
down,
as
justice
o'connor
just
described
it,
peers
through
that
crack,
would
that
have
been
a
violation
of
the
peeping
tom
statute?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--suppose
the
blind
were
one
third
of
the
way
up
instead
of
being
closed.
in
other
words,
from
what
you've
just
said
i
gather
you
would
include
even
when
the
blind
is
up
so
you
don't
have
to
go
through
contortions
to
see
what's
going
on.
that
would
still
be
an
unlawful
search.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
at
what
point
do
you?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
think
we've
backed
away
from
that,
making
it
depend
on
illegality
or
not
of
the
activity
inside,
but
police
officers,
as
justice
breyer
indicated,
have
to
have
some
kind
of
clear
lines
to
follow,
and
so
totality
of
the
circumstances
doesn't
work
very
well.
what
is
your
position
on
what
is
a
good,
legitimate
conduct
for
the
police
officer
who
wants
to
respect
the
fourth
amendment?
where
do
you
draw
the
line?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
what
about...
does
it
make
any
difference
whether
it's
somebody
who's
there
as
a
temporary
business
guest,
social
guest,
or...
what
you
just
described
doesn't
make
any
difference.
it
doesn't
make
any
difference...
you
just
say
that
home,
warrant,
unless
what?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
anyone
could...
anyone
in
the
home
could
claim
that
protection?
