mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court--
respondents
did
not
suffer
a
violation
of
their
fourth
amendment
rights
for
two
reasons.
first,
respondents'
status
as
mere
short
term
business
visitors
did
not
give
them
a
legitimate
expectation
of
privacy
in
the
home
that
they
were
visiting.
second,
the
police
officer's
observation
of
the
apartment
from
the
common
grassy
area
outside
the
window
did
not
constitute
a
search
within
the
meaning
of
the
fourth
amendment.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
i'm
sorry,
justice
kennedy.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
i
think
our
approach
is
similar.
ours
simply
has
a
higher
level
of
generality.
the
questions
we
ask
would
be
the
questions
this
court
asked
in
olson,
which
is,
is
this
person
effectively
the
functional
equivalent
of
a
member
of
the
household,
such
that
they
would
exercise
some
element
of
control,
perhaps
in
the
host's
absence?
is
this
person
someone
who's
expected
to
conduct
their
intimate
or
private
affairs
in
the
home
such
that
society
accords
them
a
privileged
sense
of
privacy
there?
does
this
person
fall
within
a
social
tradition
under
which
the
host
would
be
expected
to
defer
to
the
visitor's
privacy
interests?
for
an
overnight
guest,
those
factors
all
point
that
this
person
is
functionally
a
member
of
that
household.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
it
would
be
one
thing
that
a
trial
court
would
be
justified
in
looking
at,
but
i
don't
believe
it
would
be
dispositive.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
i
think
that
when
you
have
relatives,
that
might
tend
to
suggest
that
this
person's
more
likely
to
be
treated
as
a
member
of
the
household.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
no,
your
honor,
we
would
not
go
that
far.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
no,
your
honor.
the
cousin
who
comes
in
occasionally
is
a
mere
short
term
social
visitor.
however,
a
cousin
who
has
a
key
and
enters
on
his
own,
or
frequently
spent
the
night,
might
be
the
functional--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--well,
your
honor,
if
the
cousin
is
treated
as
a
temporary
member
of
the
household...
for
example,
he's
free
to
let
himself
in
or
admit
others...
i
think
the
cousin
might
well
have
a
legitimate
expectation--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--i
think
the
illegality
of
the
conduct
is
something
this
court
traditionally
sets
aside.
for
example,
in
olson
the
individual
was
spending
the
night
to
evade
the
police--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--because
he
engaged
in
armed
robbery,
but
the
court
didn't
look
at
specifically
the
illegal--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--he's
very
similar
to
the
defendant
in
jones,
except
for
the
fact
he
doesn't
spend
the
night,
in
that
he
exercises
control
over
the
premises
and
is
treated
as
a
member
of
the
household.
under
those
circumstances,
yes,
he
would
have
a
legitimate
expectation
of
privacy
like
any
other
member
of
the
household.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
no.
i
think
the
instances
in
which
one
is
not
an
overnight
guest
and
would
have--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--no,
i
don't
believe
a
babysitter
would
have
a
legitimate
expectation
of
privacy.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
although
there
is
some
element
of
control
in
the
fact
that
the
babysitter
stands
in
the
shoes
of
the
parents,
it's
a
very
limited
element,
and
the
babysitter
is
not
a
functional
equivalent
to
a
member
of
the
household.
the
babysitter's
not
free
to
enter
or
leave
as
she
pleases,
not
free
to
admit
others.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
if
the--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--i
think,
justice
scalia,
the
instinct
is
to
set
aside
the
illegal
nature
of
the
conduct.
if
the
drug
dealer
has
control
of
the
apartment,
admits
himself,
is
free
to
admit
others,
he's
functionally
equivalent
to
a
member
of
the
household,
and
even
though
he
is
a
drug
dealer.
on
the
other
hand,
the
babysitter
is
not
free
to
admit
others,
is
not
a
member
of
the
household.
it's
a
closer
case,
however,
your
honor,
than
what
we
have
here.
what
we
have
here
are
mere
short
term
business
invitees,
and
mere
short
term
business
invitees,
unlike--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--assuming
there
was
a
peeping
tom
offense
it's
possible,
although
it's
interesting
to
note
that
if
you
look
at
the
minnesota
statute
here
the
purpose
of
peeping
in
the
room
must
be
to
interfere
with
the
privacy
of
a
member
of
the
household,
which
strongly
suggests--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--not
under
the
minnesota
statute,
no.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
and
it's
interesting
to
note,
because
that
suggests
that
to
the
extent
state
statutes
are
relevant,
that
the
minnesota...
the
state
of
minnesota
has
determined
that
the
expectation
of
privacy
belongs
to
members
of
the
household,
or
their
functional
equivalents,
and
not
to
mere
short
term
social
or
business--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--pardon?
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
those
precise
terms
are
not,
but
i
believe
that
those
are
the
factors,
the
three
factors
we
identified
for
minnesota
v.
olson,
what
they
are
driving
at.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
yes.
it
says--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--exactly.
there
is
a
possessive--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--precisely.
there's
a
possessive
there.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
the
court
has
moved
away
from
traditional
notions
of
property
law
and
looks
at
shared
social
understandings,
as
indicated
in
katz,
but
there
is
definitely
a
possessive
in
the
text
of
the
fourth
amendment.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
if
the
officer
does
not
cross
onto
the
curtilage,
and
i
think
it's
important
to
note
the
nature
of
the
area
in
front
of
the
window
in
this
case.
if
you
look
at
joint
appendix
i
3,
it
is...
has
the
nature
of
an
open
field.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
yes,
your
honor.
this
court
has
established
that
police
officer
observation
from
open
fields
and
public
areas
is
not
a
search
within
the
meaning
of
fourth
amendment--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--your
honor,
i
don't
believe
that
the
open
fields
doctrine
or
the
public
place
doctrine
is
subject
to
fine
tuning
based
on
whether
the
officer
is
tall
and
happens
to
squat
down,
is
short,
stands
on
tiptoe,
stares
for
a
minute
or
an
hour.
those
things
that
are
exposed
to
the
open
fields
and
public
places
for
view
are
open
to
view,
and
viewing
them
does
not
constitute
a
search.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
yes.
the
record
indicates
there
were
a
gap
in
the
blind--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--i
think
the
best
reading
of
the
record,
if
you
look
at,
i
believe
it's
g
32
and
48
and
49
of
the
joint
appendix,
is
that
some
of
the
lathes
had
not
turned.
the
officer
specifically
testified
that
at
least
one
or
two
of
them
were
part
open.
i'm
saying
that
part
of
them
was
open,
yes,
and
those
are
quotes
from
the
record.
so
i
think
the
best
reading
of
the
record
is
that
parts
hadn't
turned,
but
we
don't
have
a
dispositive
finding.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
your
honor,
i'm
not
sure
that
it
would,
but
i
also
am
sure
that
it
would
not
matter,
because
state
law
cannot
convert
a
public
place
or
an
open
field
into
a
private
location
from
which
viewing
is
a
search.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
yes.
the
minnesota
supreme
court
assumed
for
the
sake
of
argument
that
the
officer
did
not
cross
into
the
curtilage.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
justice
souter,
i'm
going
to
ask
you
to
turn
to
joint
appendix
i
3
to
answer
that
question.
the
area
immediately
in
front
of
the
window
is...
i
3.
it's
towards
the
back.
if
you
look,
it's
an
open
grassy
area
leading
straight
up
to
the
window,
and
it
was
across
that
open
grassy
area
that
the
officer
walked.
there's
nothing
obscuring
the--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--i
see
that
i'm
out
of
time.
may
i
answer
the
question,
mr.
chief
justice?
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
may
i
answer
the
question?
i'm
out
of
time.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
the
record
reflects
that
he
stood
only
12
to
18
inches
away
from
the
window.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
no.
he
was
on
the
left
hand
side
of
the
window,
if
i
read
the
record
correctly,
your
honor.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
the
shrub
did
not
obscure
his
view,
and
he
approached
the
building
without
crossing
the
shrubs,
although
that
wouldn't
make
a
difference.
