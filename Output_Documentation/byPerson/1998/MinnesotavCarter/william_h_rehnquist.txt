chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
number
97-1147,
minnesota
v.
wayne
thomas
carter
and
melvin
jones.
mr.
backstrom.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
was
there
any
testimony
at
all
from
the
defendant
in
this
case
as
to
how
long
he
had
been
there?
as
i
recall,
the
record
is
simply
silent
on
that,
is
it
not?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes,
i
would
think
so,
that
if
he's
claiming
a
violation
of
the
fourth
amendment
he's
got
to
show
that
it
was
his
rights
that
were
infringed.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
backstrom,
what
happened
to
the
occupier,
the
resident
in
this
case?
was
she
charged,
or--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--convicted
as
a
result
of
trial,
or
a
guilty
plea,
or--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
know
of
many
nonprofit
criminal
enterprises?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we
do
need
to
have
something
that
we
can
hang
our
hat
on.
wouldn't
it
be
consistent
with
all
of
our
jurisprudence
to
say
that
the
expectation
of
privacy
is
limited
to
overnight
guests?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
certainly
when
you
say
guest
it
suggests
someone
who's
legitimately
on
the
premises,
not
there
by
some
sort
of
subterfuge.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
backstrom.
mr.
lamken,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
beg
your
pardon?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes.
i
was
just
looking
at
the
exhibit.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--thank
you,
mr.
lamken.
mr.
colbert,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--what
case
stands
for
that
proposition?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
are
you
saying
that
florida
v.
riley
stands
for
the
proposition
that
you
just
cited?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
you're
saying
the
police
have
to
replicate...
see
everything
that
the
informant
saw
in
order
to
verify
his
tip,
and
that
means
the
tip
doesn't
count
for
anything.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
you're
saying
even
though
the
blinds
were
up
in
all
these
apartments,
privacy
was
invaded
by
an
officer
looking
in
the
window?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
the
blinds
weren't
completely
closed.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
lamken,
justice
kennedy
asked
mr.
backstrom
while
he
was
arguing
whether
under
rakas
this
isn't
really
a
question
of
substantive
fourth
amendment
law
rather
than
"standing".
what's
your
answer
to
that?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
really
we
don't
have
to
talk
about
standing,
isn't
that
right?
what
we
have
to
talk
about
is
whether
your
client's
fourth
amendment
rights
were
violated
by
what
happened
here.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
we're
not
talking
really
about
standing.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
would
you
repeat
that?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
maybe
he
had
a
sore
foot.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
colbert,
i
was
just
glancing
through
the
opinion
of
the
supreme
court
of
minnesota,
and
i
don't
find
any
mention
in
there
of
the
fact
that
there
was
an
affidavit
somewhere
that
said
one
of
the
defendants
had
a
key.
have
i
missed
something
in
the
supreme
court's
opinion?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it
was
not
relied
on,
then,
by
the
supreme
court
of
minnesota?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
colbert.
mr.
backstrom,
you
have
1
minute
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
backstrom.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
have
the
opinion
of
the
court
to
announce
in
no.
97-1147,
minnesota
versus
carter
and
johns.
in
this
case
the
respondents
carter
and
johns
lived
in
chicago,
but
they
drove
to
eagan,
minnesota,
suburb
of
the
twin
cities
to
package
cocaine
powder.
they
went
to
the
apartment
of
a
woman
they
have
never
met
before
and
in
an
exchange
for
a
portion
of
the
cocaine,
the
woman
allowed
them
to
use
her
apartment
to
package
the
drugs
into
plastic
baggies.
acting
on
a
tip
a
police
officer
looked
through
the
apartment's
metal
window
blind
and
observed
the
three
people
sitting
around
the
kitchen
table
packaging
the
cocaine.
when
carter
and
johns
left
the
apartment
sometime
later
they
were
arrested.
after
their
indictment
on
several
drug
offences
they
argued
that
their
fourth
amendment
rights
have
been
violated
by
an
unreasonable
search
and
that
the
evidence
of
their
drug
activity
was
inadmissible.
the
state
trial
court
disagreed
and
they
were
convicted
of
various
drug
offences.
but
the
supreme
court
of
minnesota
reversed
their
convictions.
we
granted
certiorari
and
we
now
reverse
that
court
holding
that
the
fourth
amendment
did
not
protect
carter
and
johns
in
the
apartment.
the
minnsota
supreme
court
analyzed
the
case
in
terms
of
fourth
amendment
standing,
but
as
our
court
decided
20
years
ago
in
the
rakas
case,
the
proper
enquiry
under
the
fourth
amendment
is
not
whether
those
claiming
the
amendments
protection
have
standings,
but
rather
whether
they
can
say
that
their
own
fourth
amendment
rights
were
violated.
we
now
address
that
question
and
conclude
that
carter
and
johns
fourth
amendment
rights
were
not
violated.
the
fourth
amendment
protects
people
against
unreasonable
searches
of
their
houses.
we
held
in
rakas
that
the
defendants
in
that
case
could
not
claim
the
protection
of
the
fourth
amendment
over
a
weapons
seized
from
someone
else's
car
and
we
held
in
minnesota
versus
olson
that
an
overnight
houseguest
could
claim
the
fourth
amendment
protection
over
the
house
in
which
he
was
staying.
this
case
involving
short-term
business
visitors
obviously
falls
somewhere
in
between.
here
carter
and
johns
were
not
overnight
social
guests,
they
had
no
prior
relationship
with
the
owner
of
the
apartment.
there
was
no
other
purpose
to
their
visit,
but
the
business
purpose
of
packaging
drugs
and
we
have
held
that
the
fourth
amendment
does
not
protect
as
rigorously
in
the
commercial
context.
we
therefore
hold
that
carter
and
johns,
as
short-term
business
guests,
could
not
claim
the
protections
of
fourth
amendment
in
the
apartment.
and
therefore,
their
fourth
amendment
rights
were
not
violated
by
whatever
search
event
if
any
occurred.
