mr.
james
c.
backstrom
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court--
the
minnesota
supreme
court
has
ruled
that
a
person
who
is
present
in
another's
residence
for
a
brief
period
of
time
for
the
sole
purpose
of
engaging
in
an
unlawful
business
has
a
legitimate
expectation
of
privacy
in
the
premises.
this
decision,
if
allowed
to
stand,
would
reestablish
the
automatic
standing
rule
of
legitimately
on
the
premises
projected
by
this
court
20
years
ago
in
rakas
v.
illinois,
and
it
would
allow
visitors
to
vicariously
assert
the
privacy
interests
of
their
hosts.
furthermore,
the
minnesota
supreme
court's
determination
that
an
officer's
nonenhanced
observations
while
standing
in
a
public
area
outside
the
curtilage
of
a
residence
constitutes
an
unreasonable
search
is
inconsistent
with
this
court's
prior
decisions
and
will
expand
the
exclusionary
rule
to
the
detriment
of
justice.
the
defendants
here
presented
no
evidence
that
they
were
engaged
in
any
intimate
activity
normally
associated
with
the
privacy
of
a
dwelling.
they
had
no
ownership
or
property
interest
in
these
premises.
they
were
not
overnight
guests.
they
were
not
regular
visitors.
they
had
no
ability
to
control
access
to
these
premises.
mr.
james
c.
backstrom
well,
your
honor,
i
do
not
believe
that
it
would.
i
do
not
believe
that
the
fourth
amendment...
it
was
intended
to
provide
protections
to
everyone.
mr.
james
c.
backstrom
yes.
it
is
possible,
your
honor.
states
have
independent
state
constitutions
and
they
could
pass
different
provisions
that
relate
to
this,
but
this
particular
decision
the
minnesota
supreme
court
decided
based
upon
the
fourth
amendment
of
the
federal
constitution.
mr.
james
c.
backstrom
your
honor,
i
believe
it
is
an
important
federal
question,
and
when
a
decision
is
based
upon
the
federal
constitution,
as
it
was
in
this
case,
then
i
think
the
federal
standard
should
apply
and,
as
this
court
has
been
very
consistent
in
applying
its
standards,
in
essence
a
totality
of
the
circumstances
test,
which
we
would
argue
is
the
appropriate
analysis
to
be
used
in
determining
whether
someone
has
a
significant
enough
connection
to
the
premises
to
give
them
a
legitimate
expectation
of
privacy--
mr.
james
c.
backstrom
--well,
your
honor,
i
believe
mr.
chief
justice
rehnquist,
as
he
wrote
that
particular
opinion,
indicated
that
the
question
which
was
formally
referred
to
as
standing
is
a
subjective
issue
in
terms
of
having
to
analyze
the
issues,
but
there's
still...
it's
still
important
that
a
criminal
defendant
establish
a
significant
enough
connection
to
a
particular
premise
as
to
give
them
an
expectation
of
privacy
that
society
is
willing
to
accept
as
being
reasonable.
mr.
james
c.
backstrom
but...
your
honor,
i
believe
rakas
made
it
very
clear
that
the
appropriate
test
to
apply
in
these
particular
provisions
is
one
which
looks
at
an
individual's
first
subjective
expectation
of
privacy
and
then
whether
that's
the
type
of
expectation
that
society
is
willing
to
accept
as
being
reasonable.
here,
under
these
circumstances,
we
don't
believe
that
brief
transient
visitors
that
are
in
a
residence
solely
for--
mr.
james
c.
backstrom
--i
do
not
believe
it
would,
your
honor.
when
you
apply
a
totality
of
the
circumstances
analysis
to
these
types
of
issues,
you
have
to
look
at
a
wide
variety
of
factors
such
as
their
ability
to
control
access,
the
frequency
of
their
visits,
how
long
they
stayed
on
a
particular
occasion.
mr.
james
c.
backstrom
no,
i
do
not
believe
you
can,
your
honor.
it's
not
the...
you
know,
obviously
the
police
officer's
never
going
to
know
what
the
person's
connection
with
the
premises
is
at
the
time
he
conducts
his
observations,
but
the
nature
of
the
conduct
that's
involved
i
think
is
a
factor
to
be
considered.
it's
a
factor
to
be
considered
as
it
relates
back
to
their
connection
of
the
individual
to
the
premises
themselves,
but
we
believe
that
as
it
relates
back,
as
it
relates
to
the
type
of
activity
that's
normally
associated
with
the
privacy
of
a
dwelling,
then
that
nature
of
the...
the
nature
of
the
activity
may
be
a
factor
to
be
considered,
but
we
believe--
mr.
james
c.
backstrom
--well,
your
honor,
i
believe
what
i'm
saying
is
the
nature
of
the
activity
involved
is
a
factor
to
be
considered
under
a
totality
test.
mr.
james
c.
backstrom
no,
that
is
not
what
i'm
saying,
your
honor.
mr.
james
c.
backstrom
criminal
activity
is
obviously
not
the
type
of
conduct
that's
normally
associated
with
the
privacy
of
a
dwelling.
the
fact
that
the
activity
is
criminal
in
nature
should
provide
no
benefit,
is
what
we're
arguing,
to
the
totality
analysis,
whereas
if
there's--
mr.
james
c.
backstrom
--no,
we're
not,
your
honor.
mr.
james
c.
backstrom
the
record
is
silent,
your
honor.
there
was
no
testimony
offered
by
the
defendants
regarding
those
issues,
and
it
is
the
defendant's
burden
of
proof.
mr.
james
c.
backstrom
yes,
your
honor.
i
believe
that
the
ability
to
control
access
is
a
factor
to
be
considered,
and
again,
there
are...
these
different
factors
may
have
different
weight
in
the
analysis
under
the
totality
test,
but
this
court
has
used
a
totality
of
the
circumstances
test
a
long
time
for
purposes
of
fourth
amendment
analysis,
not
just
in
issues
relating
to
standing,
but
in
issues
relating
to
the
voluntariness
of
a
search,
whether
or
not
there's
enough
probable
cause
to
obtain
a
search
warrant--
mr.
james
c.
backstrom
--yes,
your
honor,
she
was
charged
and
convicted
as
well
of
the
same
charges
that
these
two
defendants
were.
mr.
james
c.
backstrom
she
was
convicted
after
a
trial
in
this
case,
your
honor.
mr.
james
c.
backstrom
well,
we
do
believe
the
rule
below,
your
honor,
would
establish
the
automatic
standing
legitimately
on
the
premises,
because
we
believe
that
the
near
engagement
in
a
common
task
with
a
resident
or
a
property
possessor
is
basically
tantamount
to
establishing
that.
it's
nothing
more
than--
mr.
james
c.
backstrom
--i
do
not
believe
it
is,
your
honor.
the
two
defendants
in
this
case
were
mere
business
invitees.
they
were
not
residents
of
this
apartment.
they
were
engaged
in--
mr.
james
c.
backstrom
--a
process.
they
were
just
like--
mr.
james
c.
backstrom
--well,
as
this
court
pointed
out
in
lewis
v.
united
states,
your
honor,
when
the
home
is
converted
for
business
purposes,
that
business
is
entitled
to
no
greater
sanctity
than
if
it
were
carried
on
in
a
store,
a
garage,
or
a
car.
this
court
has
addressed
similar
issues.
in
that
case
it
was
an
unlawful
business,
as
it
is
here,
and--
mr.
james
c.
backstrom
--well,
your
honor,
i
believe
what
we're
arguing
here
is
that
the
business
differential,
the
business
versus
a
social
guest
is
a
line
to
be
drawn,
and
an
important
one,
but
that's
not
to
say
that
business
visitors
don't
have
the
rights
of
privacy--
mr.
james
c.
backstrom
--no,
your
honor.
mr.
james
c.
backstrom
there
is
no
dramatic
difference
between
our
two
briefs,
your
honor.
we
would
agree
that
most
temporary
guests,
as
the
solicitor
has
put
forth
in
their
brief,
would
not
have
a
legitimate
expectation
of
privacy
in
the
premises.
however,
we
believe
that
under
certain
circumstances
a
short
term
guest
may
have
those
connections,
if
they've
been
a
frequent
visitor,
had
ability
to
control
access,
and
so
forth.
mr.
james
c.
backstrom
well,
again,
i
think
that
is
a
factor
to
be
considered,
your
honor,
the
frequency
of
visits,
what's
the
nature
of
their
connection--
mr.
james
c.
backstrom
--i
would...
your
honor,
i
would--
[laughter]
i
would...
i
do
not
believe
that
person
would
have
a
legitimate
expectation
of
privacy
in
the
premises
unless
there
were
other
factors
associated
with
their
connection
to
that
particular
residence.
mr.
james
c.
backstrom
like,
they've
been
frequent
visitors,
they're
frequently...
that
they
have
the
ability--
mr.
james
c.
backstrom
--well,
there
are
factors
to
be
considered.
there
are--
mr.
james
c.
backstrom
--well,
i...
that's
perhaps
enough
additional
information
that
might
render
their
connection
with
the
premises
more
significant
than
the
first
time
visitor
to
a
particular
premises.
mr.
james
c.
backstrom
well,
your
honor,
we're
just...
we're
suggesting
that
under
totality
of
the
circumstances
test
you
have
to
look
at
all
of
those
factors.
mr.
james
c.
backstrom
that
distinction
by
itself
may
not
be,
but
if
you
add
that
to
some
of
the
other
factors,
such
as
whether
they
have
an
ongoing
intimate
relationship
with
the
person
that
they're
involved
in
playing
this--
mr.
james
c.
backstrom
--well,
that
in
itself
may
not
be
enough
to
give
you
a
significant
enough
connection
to
a
residence
other
than
your
own
for
purposes
of
establishing
whether
you
have
an
expectation
of
privacy
that
society's
willing
to
accept
as
being
reasonable.
mr.
james
c.
backstrom
your
honor,
i
don't
believe
it's
the
intent
that's
in
the
mind
of
the
host
that's
inviting
someone
in.
mr.
james
c.
backstrom
well,
your
honor,
i
do
not
believe
that
the
test
hinges
on
the
intent
of
the
parties.
i
believe
the
test
requires
an
application
of
society's
expectations
under
a
totality
analysis.
mr.
james
c.
backstrom
yes,
i
believe...
this
court
has
obviously
indicated
that
in
minnesota
v.
olson,
and
we
believe
that's
the
outer
standard
for
purposes
of
establishing
a
legitimate
expectation
of
privacy.
on
the
other
hand,
one
certainly
has
to
be
legitimately
on
the
premises,
and
in
the
area
in
between
you
need
to
analyze
the
factors--
mr.
james
c.
backstrom
--yes.
mr.
james
c.
backstrom
i
believe
that
is
an
important
distinction.
it's
an
important
distinction
in
this
case,
your
honor,
because
that's
what
we're
dealing
with
here.
mr.
james
c.
backstrom
yes.
mr.
james
c.
backstrom
absolutely,
your
honor.
mr.
james
c.
backstrom
i
agree,
your
honor,
and
what
we're
asking
the
court
to
establish
in
this
case
under
these
facts
is
that
a
short
term
guest
in
another
person's
residence
for
business
purposes
does
not
have
a
legitimate
expectation
of
privacy.
if
i
have
any
further
time,
i'd
like
to
reserve
it,
your
honor.
mr.
james
c.
backstrom
thank
you,
your
honor.
just
quickly
to
clarify
a
few
facts,
in
reference
to
the
key,
that
was
an
affidavit
submitted
by
an
attorney
after
the
trial
court
record
was
closed.
we
do
not
believe
it
is
part
of
the
record
in
this
case,
and
it
was
not
considered
as
such
by
the
minnesota
supreme
court.
the
slippers
worn
by
mr.
johns
were
on
his
feet
at
the
time
he
was
arrested
outside
of
the
apartment,
so
that
does
not
indicate
any
connection
to
the
premises.
mr.
james
c.
backstrom
yes.
we
believe...
the
record's
not
clear
on
that,
but
he
had
them...
he
had
those
slippers
on
when
he
was
arrested
in
his
car
outside
of
the
apartment.
in
reference
to
justice
souter's
question,
we
do
not
believe
the...
there
would
be
any
tempting
of
the
police
in
reference
to
these
issues,
because
the
police
will
never
know
who
has
an
expectation
of
privacy
in
the
premises.
their
conduct
relates--
mr.
james
c.
backstrom
--yes,
we
believe
you
should,
your
honor.
and
in
reference...
finally,
in
reference
to
the
question
that
justice
breyer
had
regarding
the
officers'
viewing
through
the
window,
he
never
crossed
the
bushes,
and
it's
clear
if
you
look
at
g
44
to
45
in
the
record.
thank
you,
your
honor.
