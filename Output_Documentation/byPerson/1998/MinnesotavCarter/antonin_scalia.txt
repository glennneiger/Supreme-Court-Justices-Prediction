justice
antonin
scalia
even
if
he's
not
an
overnight
guest.
you're
acknowledging
that
if
it's
a
relative
who
visits
frequently,
a
cousin
who
often
comes
in
for
an
hour
to
have
lunch,
that
that
would
make--
justice
antonin
scalia
--you
have
an
absolute
rule
that
if
it's
not
overnight
it's
not
covered,
is
that
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
excluding
spending
the
night.
this
cousin
never
spends
the
night.
he
has
a
key,
and
he
comes
in
and
has
lunch
with
some
frequency,
once
a
week.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
if
he's
not
a
cousin.
he's
a
drug
dealer,
and
he
comes
in...
he's
given
a
key,
comes
in
every
week
for
lunch.
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
this
would
be...
he
would
have...
you're
saying
he
would
have
the
fourth
amendment
privilege
as
well,
just
like
the
cousin.
justice
antonin
scalia
--which
is
sort
of
the
way
the
fourth
amendment
reads,
too,
isn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
to
have
people
be
secure
in
their
homes,
not
in
somebody
else's
home.
justice
antonin
scalia
in
their
houses,
but--
justice
antonin
scalia
--but
we've
gotten
beyond
that,
haven't
we?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
guess
if
you're
so
careless
as
to
leave
a...
that's
what
i
found
extraordinary
about
this
case.
apparently
they
left...
the
blind
wasn't
closed
properly.
there
was
a
gap
in
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
they
were
standing
there
are
the
table
handing
out
the
white
powder.
i
don't
think
that's
a
reasonable
expectation
of
privacy.
if
you
don't
pull
your
blinds
down--
justice
antonin
scalia
--you
don't
have
a
reasonable
expectation.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
what
if
he
walks
across
a
large
field
that's
owned
by
a
farmer
and
looks
inside
the
barn.
we've
held
that's
okay.
justice
antonin
scalia
is
the
public
expected
to
do
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
if
he
had
walked
across
that
field
and
looked
into
the
house,
although
still
beyond
the
curtilage
of
the
house,
would
that
have
been
banned?
justice
antonin
scalia
really?
i
don't
think
so.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
if
you
closed
them
as
much
as
you
could
and
when
you
closed
them
as
much
as
you
could
they
were
a
third
of
the
way
up?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
just
doing
it
as
much
as
you
could
is
not...
is
not
the
touchstone.
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
so
what
you're
really
saying
is
here,
they
weren't
that
much
open.
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
justice
antonin
scalia
excuse
me.
it's
necessary
that
he
have
taken
steps
to...
so
if
i'm
an
overnight
guest
and
i
haven't
taken
any
steps,
i
just
said,
you
know,
thank
you
for
having
me,
the
blinds
are
down
already,
i
haven't
done
anything,
my
host
has
locked
the
door,
my
host
has
put
the
blinds
down,
and
i'm
just
there,
i
haven't
really
done
anything
to
preserve
my
privacy,
i
don't
have
an
expectation
of
privacy?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
with
the
pizza
man
the
host
has...
you
know,
the
pizza
man
comes
in,
he
says
lock
the
door
behind
you,
you
know,
this
is
a
dangerous
neighborhood,
and
he
has
all
the
blinds
down...
he
always
keeps
them
down
because
he's
right
next
to
the
street,
just
like
this.
he's
worried
about
people
looking
in.
justice
antonin
scalia
this
is
justice
o'connor's
pizza
man.
he's
not
my
pizza
man.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
isn't
a
question
of
whether
you
lose
your
privacy.
it's
a
question
of
whether
the
people
who
come
to
your
home
for
business
acquire
your
residential
privacy
when
they
come
there,
not
for
residence
but
for
business.
why
should
they
be
treated
differently
than
people
who
come
to
your
business
to
do
business?
justice
antonin
scalia
--he
should
have
arrested
this
guy
as
a
peeping
tom.
justice
antonin
scalia
is
that
the
crucial
issue,
whether
he
had
an
expectation
of
privacy,
or
is
it
rather
whether
it
is
the
sort
of
an
expectation
that
society
is
prepared
to
recognize
as
reasonable?
i
mean,
it
seems
to
me
you
always
have
an
expectation
of
privacy
when
you
come
into
somebody's
home.
even
the
pizza
man
who
walks
in,
you
know,
he
doesn't
expect
anybody
to
be
peeping
in
the
blinds.
if
you're
in
somebody's
home,
you
expect
it
to
be
private,
don't
you?
justice
antonin
scalia
no
matter
what
capacity
you're
there
in.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
really
what
we're
getting
at
is
not
whether
there's
an
expectation
of
privacy,
but
whether
it
is
the
sort
of
an
expectation
of
privacy
that
society
is
willing
to
recognize
as
reasonable,
which
leaves
it
up
to
us,
i
guess,
as
to
what
expectations
we
are
willing
to
recognize
as
reasonable.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
burden
is
that?
i
mean,
again,
if
you're
asserting
the
fourth
amendment
privilege
it's
up
to
you
to
establish
that
they
were
more
than
that,
not
up
to
the
state
to
prove
that
they
weren't.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
all
you
have
to
go
on
is
one
of
them
was
wearing
slippers.
do
we
know
that
he
didn't
always
wear
slippers?
justice
antonin
scalia
he
might
have
had
a
sore
foot.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
need
a
stronger
argument,
it
seems
to
me.
i
think
you're
going
to
have
a
hard
time
establishing--
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
if
that's
a
sound
reason,
then
you
pick
up
the
pizza
delivery
man
and
the
avon
lady...
you
pick
up
everybody.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
is
that
important?
if
your
object
is
what
justice
souter
says,
to
reinforce
the
privacy
expectations
of
the
owner,
you
ought
to
let
anybody
reinforce
it,
the
pizza
man,
the
avon
lady...
who
cares
whether
they
have
an
expectation
of
privacy.
you're
interested
in
the
homeowner,
and
you
want
to
vindicate
his
expectation.
on
that
theory
you
should
let
everybody
raise
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
do
you
mean,
he'd
worn
them
out...
he
was
walking
outside
the
apartment,
so
he
might
have
arrived
in
slippers?
