justice
clarence
thomas
this
case
comes
to
us
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
third
circuit.
respondent
and
his
cohorts
committed
a
crime
of
kidnapping
that
began
in
texas
and
was
carried
out
among
other
places
in
new
jersey,
new
york,
and
maryland.
at
one
point
while
in
maryland
respondent
used
a
357
magnum
revolver
to
threaten
the
hostagesâ€™
life.
he
was
arrested
and
tried
along
with
several
codefendants
in
united
states
district
court
for
the
district
of
new
jersey
on
charges
of
kidnapping
and
using
and
carrying
a
firearm
during
and
and
in
relation
to
the
kidnapping
in
violation
of
18
u.s.c.
924(c)(1).
respondent
moved
to
dismiss
the
firearm
charge
arguing
that
venue
for
the
charge
was
proper
solely
in
maryland.
the
only
place
where
the
government
can
prove
that
he
used
the
gun.
the
district
court
denied
the
motion
but
on
a
two
to
one
vote,
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
third
circuit
reversed.
it
held
that
the
924(c)(1)
charge
offense
is
committed
only
where
defendant
actually
uses
or
carries
a
gun
and
hence
could
only
be
prosecuted
in
that
place
and
for
our
purposes
that
would
be
maryland.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
we
reverse.
the
constitution
requires
that
crimes
be
tried
in
the
place
where
they
were
committed.
as
we
confirmed
just
last
term
in
united
states
versus
cabrales,
the
location
of
an
offense
must
be
determined
from
the
nature
of
the
crime
alleged
and
the
location
of
the
act
or
acts
constituting
it.
the
firearm
offebnse
at
issue
here
provides
that
whoever
during
and
in
relation
to
any
crime
of
violence
uses
or
carries
a
firearm,
shall
be
sentenced
to
imprisonment
for
five
years.
the
offense
contains
two
essential
conduct
elements:
using
or
carrying
a
firearm
and
committing
a
crime
of
violence,
in
this
case
kidnapping.
as
the
court
explains
the
united
states
vresus
lombardo,
where
crime
consist
of
distinct
parts
which
have
different
localities
the
whole
maybe
tried
where
any
part
can
be
proved
to
have
been
done.
here
respondent
used
the
gun
in
maryland
during
and
in
relation
to
a
kidnapping
offense
that
began
in
texas
and
continued
in
new
york,
new
jersey,
and
maryland.
kidnapping
was
committed
in
all
of
the
places
that
any
part
of
it
took
place
and
venue
for
the
kidnapping
charge
was
therefore
proper
in
new
jersey.
the
firearm
charge
was
incorporated
to
kidnapping
as
a
conduct
element
of
the
offense
could
be
tried
there
as
well.
justice
scalia
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
justice
stevens
has
joined.
