unknown
speaker
what's
the
english
meaning
of
actus
reus?
unknown
speaker
is
conduct
an
equally
satisfactory
word,
do
you
think,
as
actus
reus?
unknown
speaker
you
could
translate
it
as
the
criminal,
the
criminal
act.
unknown
speaker
you're
right.
when
you
use
a
word
like
conduct
it
sort
of
sucks
in
surrounding
circumstances
more
than...
you'd
better
stick
with
the
latin,
i
think.
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
is
that
the
criminal
act
that
is
being
punished
by
this
statute?
unknown
speaker
no,
the
use
during--
unknown
speaker
--what
do
you
think
that
those
who
revolted
against
king
george
would
have
thought
if...
you
know,
one
of
their
objections
was
that
he
would
transport
us
across
the
seas
to
be
tried
for
crimes.
what
if
king
george
had
enacted
a
statute
like
this
that
made
it
unlawful
to
use
a
firearm
in
connection
with
a
kidnapping
offense,
and
the
firearm
was
only
used
in
boston,
and
the
kidnapping...
i'm
sorry,
the...
yes,
the
firearm
was
only
used
in
boston,
and
some
of
the
kidnapping
during
which
the
firearm
was
used
occurred
in
england.
do
you
think
they
would
have
thought
it
was
fair
to
try
the
defendant--
unknown
speaker
--in
london
for
this
firearm
that
he
possessed
in
boston?
unknown
speaker
there's
another
statute
that
punishes
kidnapping,
isn't
there?
i
mean,
that's
a
separate
offense.
unknown
speaker
and
this
statute
says,
if
during
kidnapping
you
possess
a
firearm--
unknown
speaker
--you
get
an
additional
penalty,
right?
unknown
speaker
uh-huh.
unknown
speaker
let's
assume
he
gets
a
penalty
for
the
kidnapping,
all
right.
unknown
speaker
he
could
still
be
tried
for
using
a
firearm
during
that
kidnapping,
right?
unknown
speaker
because
that's
a
separate
offense.
there's
an
additional
element
involved.
unknown
speaker
using
the
firearm.
unknown
speaker
that's
the
only
thing
he's
being
punished
additionally
for,
and
you
say
even
if
he
used
that
firearm
only
in
one
state,
he
could
be
tried
in
another
state,
where
the
kidnapping
for
which
he's
been
separately
punishing...
punished
for,
happened
also
to
occur.
unknown
speaker
mr.
wolfson,
you
submitted
the
revision
of
924(c),
and
i
notice
that
in
this
respect
there's
no
relevant
change,
and
i
wondered
whether,
in
light
of
cabrales
last
term,
whether
the
government
had
urged
any
clarification
of
this
provision
to
avoid
the
problem
we're
dealing
with.
unknown
speaker
mr.
wolfson,
help
me
out,
because
it
bears
some
relevance
as
to
how
i
view
this
case.
i
think
i
may
have
been
wrong
when
i
suggested
earlier
that
you
could
have
tried
the
kidnapping
in
one
place
and
then
later
tried
the
gun
offense.
it
would
be
double
jeopardy,
wouldn't
it?
each
offense
has
to
contain
an
element
that
the
other
does
not.
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
garrett
is
the
name
of
it?
unknown
speaker
what
about
the
hobbs
act?
unknown
speaker
suppose
that
a
person
hijacks
a
truck
in
maryland,
and
the
contents
of
the
truck
were
intended
for
distribution
everywhere
from
puerto
rico
to
alaska,
does
that
mean
that
he...
and
it
affects
commerce
in
every
state
of
the
united
states
and
the
territories
thereof.
all
right,
now
can
this
person
who
hijacked
the
truck
in
maryland,
since
he's
affected
commerce
everywhere,
be
tried
anywhere?
unknown
speaker
so
what's
your...
your
view
is
that
under--
unknown
speaker
--and
there
is
no
such
thing
as
just
a
jurisdictional
requirement?
unknown
speaker
so
there's
nothing...
no
contrary
authority
on
that.
you
mean...
i'm
surprised--
unknown
speaker
--that
you
can't...
anywhere,
alaska...
i
mean,
most
commerce,
you
know,
affects...
it's...
we're
all
interrelated,
quite--
unknown
speaker
--oh,
it's
all
labeled
in
the
truck.
unknown
speaker
can
we
put
it
just
a
different
way?
if
you
win
this
case,
would
it
not
mean
that
in
the
hobbs
act
case
that
justice
breyer
posits,
the
prosecution
could
be
brought
anywhere
that
the
goods
might
have
been
destined?
unknown
speaker
why
does
it?
i
mean,
why
does
it
seem
strange
that
what...
that
effects
should
hinge
upon
what
you
say?
unknown
speaker
i
mean--
unknown
speaker
--right.
unknown
speaker
what
about
whoever...
suppose
they
say,
whoever,
knowing
that
a
gun
will
be
used
in
a
crime
of
violence,
carries
a
gun.
whoever
knowing.
see,
it
says
knowing,
rather
than
in
relation
to,
and
of
course
he
carries
the
gun
in
maryland
and
he
knows
that
the
crime
will
be
committed
in
california.
unknown
speaker
so
knowing,
the
reason
i
picked
knowing
is
because
i'm
thinking
of
the
laundering,
the
money
laundering.
unknown
speaker
whoever
knowing
that
this
came
from
a
crime
of
violence,
this
money,
deposits
it.
well,
we
know
that
the
fact
that
the
crime
is
in...
you
know,
that
the
crime
of
violence,
or
the
underlying
crime
was
in
some
other
state,
you
can't
try
it
there.
unknown
speaker
in
the
present
case,
the
only
difference
it
would
have
made
is,
how
many
months
in
the...
i
mean,
if
you
could
have
brought
the
whole
prosecution
where
the
gun
was
used...
i
forget
what
the
different
states
were.
where
was
it,
new
jersey
that
the
gun
was
used?
unknown
speaker
in
maryland.
unknown
speaker
it's
clear
you
could
have
prosecuted
the
whole
case
in
maryland.
unknown
speaker
why?
unknown
speaker
i
see.
unknown
speaker
i
see.
unknown
speaker
okay,
but
that's...
but
that's
just
sort
of
accidental
in
this
case.
i
mean,
let's
assume
the
kidnapping
of
just
one
person
and
the
use
of
the
gun,
never
mind
the
other
kidnapping.
it
was
a
separate
kidnapping.
this
kidnapping
could
have
been
prosecuted,
plus
the
use
of
the
gun,
the
separate
offense
for
use
of
the
gun,
in
maryland,
or
you
could
have
prosecuted
just
the
kidnapping
in
either
new
jersey
or
texas,
i
assume.
unknown
speaker
and
had
you
prosecuted
it
there,
you
would
have
gotten
a
sentencing
enhancement
for
the
use
of
the
gun.
unknown
speaker
so
what
difference
are
we
talking
about
between
getting
the
additional
sentence
for
use
of
the
gun,
convicting
of
a
separate
crime,
and
simply
getting
the
sentencing
enhancement
for
kidnapping
with
the
use
of--
unknown
speaker
--you
could
generalize
as
to
the
relative--
unknown
speaker
--insignificance
of
the
difference
in
this
case,
you
say.
unknown
speaker
mr.
wolfson,
you
said
that
the
majority
in
the
third
circuit
agreed
that
if
the
statute
had
been
reworded
as
judge
alito
proposed,
there
wouldn't
be
any
question
about
proper
venue
here.
was
that
implicit
in
his
decision?
i
didn't
see
an
expressed--
unknown
speaker
--agreement
to
that
effect.
unknown
speaker
--the
page
you're
reading?
unknown
speaker
okay.
unknown
speaker
very
well,
mr.
wolfson.
mr.
mcdonald,
we'll
hear
from
you.
unknown
speaker
it's
not
committed
either
until
there's
been
a
kidnapping.
unknown
speaker
what
about
a
kidnapping
that,
as
in
this
case,
simply
continued
from
one
state
to
another?
unknown
speaker
what's
your
authority
for
saying
that
this
is
not
a
continuing
offense?
the
kidnapping
surely
is
a
continuing
offense.
unknown
speaker
you
don't
deny
it
could
be
a
continuing
offense.
you
just
say
it
only
continues
as
long
as
the
firearm
is
being
used
during
the
other
crime.
unknown
speaker
and
if
you
continue
to
use
the
firearm
during
the
entire
kidnapping,
it's
a
continuing
offense.
unknown
speaker
your
position
is
that
the
duration
of
the
continuity
is
limited
by
the
use
of
the
firearm.
unknown
speaker
as
the
statute
says,
whoever
uses
a
firearm
during,
and
there's
only
one
point
in
time
here
that
the
firearm
was
used
during
the
kidnapping.
unknown
speaker
what
do
you
mean,
out
of
a
sense
of
desperation?
you'd
think
it
was
mr.
avendano
who'd
be
desperate.
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
i
think
everybody
understands
that
this...
where
the
kidnapping
took
place
and
where
the
gun
took
place.
the
real
question
for
me
anywhere...
anyway,
is,
under
this
statute
is
the
kidnapping
part
of
the
offense?
i
know
it
wasn't
completed
till
he
had
the
gun,
but
is
the
kidnapping
part
of
it?
unknown
speaker
and
you
cite
a
bunch
of
cases,
and
what
the,
i
take
it
the
solicitor
general
has
said
is,
i
can
look
far
and
wide
for
a
case.
i
may
find
one
that
has
a
clear
jurisdictional
element
where
they
said
that
isn't
part.
but
aside
from
those
cases,
all
the
other
cases
are
against
you,
so
i
want
to
know
which
is
the
example
that
you
would
pick
out
and
say,
no,
no,
here
is
a
statute,
it
refers
to
several
separate
things,
one
of
them
is
a
big
one,
the
others
seem
minor,
all
are
elements,
and
a
court
has
held
that
one
or
more
of
those
elements,
not
jurisdictional,
is
not,
for
purposes
of
venue,
part
of
the
offense.
unknown
speaker
which
one?
unknown
speaker
well,
that
was
a
case
involving
the
granting
or
the
receiving
of
rebates.
were
there
other
elements
of
the
crime?
unknown
speaker
and
those
other
elements
had
occurred
other
places?
unknown
speaker
it
seems
to
me
in
the
cabrales
case
the
court
was
actually
rather
careful
not
to
say
that
the
only
place
for
the
venue
is
where
all
of
the
elements
of
the
crimes
have
occurred,
all
of
the
active
conduct
necessary
to
commit
the
crimes
have...
it
seems
to
me
cabrales
is
very
important
for
what
it
did
not
say
in
that
respect,
as
we
look
at
this
case.
unknown
speaker
but
it
didn't
have
to
be
illegally
obtained
by
that
particular
defendant.
unknown
speaker
but
that
was
an
after-the-fact
crime.
in
cabrales
the
opinion
repeatedly
says,
this
is...
you
have
to
type
this
case.
it's
in
the
after-the-fact
category.
here
we
have
a
during
situation.
that's
quite
different.
unknown
speaker
no,
but
isn't
the
response
to
that
argument...
i
mean,
that's
a
fair
argument,
but
isn't
the
response
to
that
argument
a
very
practical
one,
that
we're
getting
at
a
problem
of
practical
unfairness
when
we
devise
venue
rules
and
congress
passes
them.
there
isn't
any
practical
unfairness
here,
for
the
simple
reason
that
in...
on
the
government's
theory
in
a
case
like
this,
your
client
can
be
prosecuted
in
any
one
of
those
other
jurisdictions
anyway,
so
that
your
client
is
not
being,
as
it
were,
transported
across
the
seas
in
the
sort
of
declaration
of
independence
sense,
and
isn't
that
sort
of
argument
for
fairness
the
response
to
the
argument
that
you
have
just
made?
unknown
speaker
mr.
mcdonald,
on
your
theory,
what
would
be
the
result
under
judge
alito's
suggested
revision
of
this
statute,
whoever
commits
any
crime
of
violence
or
drug
trafficking
crime
for
which
he
may
be
prosecuted
in
a
court
of
the
united
states
and
during
and
in
relation
to
that
crime
uses
or
carries
a
firearm.
would
that
be
a
different
result
under
your
theory
as
to
venue?
unknown
speaker
well,
but
if
under
the
dissent's
rewriting
the
venue
would
have
been
proper
even
under
your
view,
it
is
just
strictly,
then,
a
matter
almost
of
grammar
to
decide
where
venue
can
be.
unknown
speaker
maybe
that's
the
way
it
should
be,
but
it's
what
it
boils
down
to.
unknown
speaker
well,
but
that's...
that
would
be
the
language
in
the
rewritten
version
that
i
read
you,
and
during
and
in
relation
to
that
crime
uses
or
carries
a
firearm.
unknown
speaker
well
then,
that
isn't
the
same
answer,
though,
you
gave
me
a
couple
of
minutes
ago.
unknown
speaker
would
the
government
still
lose?
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
your
first
answer
was,
because
under
that
statute
it
becomes
a
sentencing
factor
rather
than
a
different
crime.
unknown
speaker
what
we've
got
before
us
is
two
separate
crimes.
unknown
speaker
i'd
like
you
to
go
back
to
what
you
said
just
before.
it
seems
to
me
that
this
case
was
held
for
cabrales
because
if
cabrales
had
come
out
the
other
way--
--it
would
have
been
cert
denied.
yes.
unknown
speaker
suppose
cabrales
had
come
out
the
other
way.
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
yes.
mr.
mcdonald,
are
you
defending
what
is
called
the
active
verb
theory?
i
haven't
heard
you
really
put
much
emphasis
on
that.
is--
unknown
speaker
--do
you
find
that
a
useful
mode
of
analysis?
unknown
speaker
i've
looked
at
the
case
you
cited,
the
united
states
v.
midstate
co.,
and
there
the
court
was
very
careful
to
say
that
the
transport
of
the
goods
through
pennsylvania
was
a
lawful
act,
and
that
congress
did
not
intend
that
subsequent
conduct
or
events
should
stamp
criminality
upon
an
act
that
was
lawful,
and
so
there's
no
continuing
event.
that's
quite
different
from
kidnapping,
which
was
unlawful
at
all
times.
unknown
speaker
i
think
the
case
is
just
not
so
helpful
for
your
position.
unknown
speaker
that
wasn't
the
distinction
the
court
made.
the
court
said,
if
you
have
a
continuous
offense,
then
it
must
be
an
offense
in
the
state
which
is...
where
the
case
is
being
tried,
and
it
found
that
that
was
just
not
that...
not
true.
unknown
speaker
that's
not
what...
i
just
got
that
to
look
at
it.
i
just
agree
with
justice
kennedy.
it
seemed
as
if
the
statute
said
it's
an
illegal
offense
to
give
or
receive
a
rebate,
and
what
it
seemed
to
say...
i
just
looked
at
it
quickly...
is
that
in
pennsylvania
the
transportation
continued,
it
went
through
pennsylvania,
but
it
wasn't
given
in
pennsylvania,
the
rebate,
nor
was
it
received
in
pennsylvania.
what
happened
is,
the
goods
passed
through
pennsylvania.
so
it
sounds
as
if
the
court's
saying,
pennsylvania
had
nothing
to
do
with
this
under
the
statute.
unknown
speaker
in
connection
with
is
a
preposition,
just
like
during.
i
mean,
it's
the
same
structure--
--it
sounds
like
it.
--that
you
have
in
front
of
us
here.
unknown
speaker
well,
is
there
a
case
where
i
could
look
at
it
and
find
the
following,
any
case
in
any
court.
what
i'd
look
at
is,
there'd
be
a
statute,
and
the
statute
would
have
several
elements,
and
i'd
leave
out
of
the
picture
any
element
that
the
defendant...
that
does
not
involve
the
defendant's
doing
something,
or
being
personally
involved.
for
example,
if
an
element
is
at
night,
the
defendant
doesn't
create
night,
so
leave
that
out
of
it.
also
leave
out
of
it
any
jurisdictional
part,
pure
jurisdiction,
like
the
gun
statute.
all
right,
now
are
you
thinking
of
a
set
of
elements?
give
me
a
case
which
said
that
venue
is
improper
in
any
one
of
those
elements.
unknown
speaker
or
any...
anything.
see,
what
they're
saying
is
that,
despite
perhaps
the
appeal
of
your
argument,
they
have
a
clear
test,
and
moreover
it's
one
that
the
courts
have
never...
never,
never,
never
departed
from.
i
think
that's
putting
their
argument
as
strongly
as
i
can,
perhaps
too
strongly
in
their
favor,
but
the...
a
clear
answer
that
would
be,
look,
here
are
three
cases
which
have
said
that
there
are
five
elements
to
this
crime,
and
four
of
those
elements
involve
the
defendant,
and
as
to
number
4,
you
can't
put
it
there.
it's
just
peripheral.
it's
too
irrelevant,
too
far
away.
unknown
speaker
okay.
suppose,
then,
we
said,
you're
right.
this
is
