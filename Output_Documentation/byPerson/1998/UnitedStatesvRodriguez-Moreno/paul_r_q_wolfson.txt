mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
under
the
constitution's
venue
provisions,
a
criminal
trial
shall
be
held
in
the
state
where
the
crime
shall
have
been
committed.
the
issue
in
this
case
is
how
that
principle
is
to
be
applied
in
a
case
where
the
offense
has
more
than
one
actus
reus
element
and
where
one
of
those
actus
reus
elements
was
carried
out
over
several
states.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
the
english...
it
can
be
the...
it
can
be
interpreted
as
the
act
of
the
crime,
or
the
act
of
the
thing,
and
it
does
not
have
a
universal
meaning,
but
generally
speaking
the
courts
have
looked
at...
have
isolated
actus
reus
as
the
conduct
that
must
be
performed
by
the
defendant
to
make
him
punishable
for
a
crime.
it
is
generally
distinguishable
from
two
other
aspects
of
the
crime,
the
mens
rea,
or
the
mental
state,
and
other
circumstances
surrounding
the
crime.
this
is
generally
the
approach
that
is
taken
by
the
model
penal
code,
which
does
not
use
the
term,
actus
reus,
but
which
uses
the
term...
but
which
distinguishes
among
conduct,
mental
state,
and
attendant
circumstances,
and
that
sort
of...
that
provision
of
the
various
aspects
of
the
crime
is
also
reflected
in
justice
holmes'
discussion
of
the
common
law.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
i
think
conduct
is
not
an
equally
satisfactory
term,
because
actus
reus
refers
specifically
to
conduct
undertaken
by
the
defendant
which
society
has
an
interest
in
punishing.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
the
criminal
act,
or
the
criminal
conduct.
i
use
conduct
because
one
has
to
take
into
account
certain
types
of
crimes
that
revolve
on
failure
to
perform
a
duty
in
which
i
think
one
would
have
to
acknowledge
that
the
criminal
conduct
was
the
failure
to
show
up
at
the
appointed
time
and
place,
as
opposed
to
undertaking
some
overt
act.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
well,
i'm...
i'll
do
my
best,
thank
you.
but
to
return,
our...
the
rule
that
we
propose
and
that
is
reflected
in
this
court's
decisions
is
that
in
any
state
where
any
of
the
actus
reus
elements
is
carried
out,
that
is
an
appropriate
place
for
the
defendant
to
be
prosecuted.
in
this
case,
that
means
that
respondent
was
properly
prosecuted
in
new
jersey,
because
one
of
the
elements
of
the
offense,
defined
by
section
924(c),
was
the
kidnapping,
which
in
this
case
was
a
continuing,
unitary,
undivided
crime
that
began
in
texas,
was
continued
into
new
jersey,
which
was
for
some
period
of
time
the
defendant's
base
of
operations,
and
then
was
continued
into
maryland.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
it
is
part
of
the
criminal
act
that
is
being
punished
by
this
statute.
the
statute...
where
the
court
of
appeals
went
wrong,
i
think,
was
to
say
that
the
statute
punishes
the
use
of
the
firearm
only,
and
they
didn't
look
at
the
fact
that--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--the
use
during,
that's
correct,
but
that
is...
that
is
our
point,
which
is
that
it's
not
just
during,
it
is
during
and
in
relation
to
the
underlying
crime
of
violence
for
which
this
defendant
may
be
prosecuted,
and
to
obtain
a
conviction
under
section
924(c),
the
government
must
prove
that
the
defendant
did
commit
that
underlying
crime
of
violence,
or
was
punishable
for
it
under
some
principle
such
as
pinkerton
liability,
or
aiding
and
abetting
liability.
it
is
equally
an
element
of
the
offense
as
the
use
of...
as
the
use
or
carrying
of
the
firearm.
in
its
application,
this
statute
essentially
is
no
different
from
a
statute
that
might
define
a
crime
of
aggravated
kidnapping.
i
mean,
suppose,
for
example...
kidnapping
is
defined
in
section
1201(a)
of
the
united
states
code,
of
title
18,
as
whoever
kidnaps
and
holds
for
ransom
any
person
shall
be
punishable
by
a
term
of
years.
what
924(c)...
it's
as
if
there
were
an
added
sentence
to
that
section
and
says,
and
whoever,
during
and
in
relation
to
that
kidnapping,
uses
or
carries
a
gun,
shall
also
be
punished
by
an
additional
5
years.
i
think
it
would
be
odd
in
that
situation
if
someone
were
prosecuted
for
aggravated
kidnapping
to
say
that
the
only
place
he
could
be
prosecuted
would
be
where
the
aggravation
took
place,
and
not
over
the
entirety
of...
and
not
anywhere
where
the
entirety
of
the
kidnapping
takes
place.
now,
what
congress
has
done
in
924(c)
is,
it
has
essentially
created
sort
of
an
off-the-shelf
aggravation
element
which
can
be
applied
to
a
variety
of
crimes
of
violence
or
drug-trafficking
crimes.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
well,
if
the--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--if
they
assoc...
if
the
people
who
used
the
firearm
associated
themselves
with
a
kidnapping
that
takes
place
in
a
variety
of
jurisdictions,
the
constitution's
venue
provisions
do
recognize
that
it
is
proper
to
bring
a
defendant
to
trial
in
the
place
where
he
has
committed
a
criminal
activity.
the
constitution
does
not
say
that
the
proper
venue
for
a
crime
shall
be
where
the
defendant,
in
the
state
of
which
a
defendant
is
a
citizen.
now...
or
where
the
defendant
has
resides.
now,
it
might
have
taken
that
approach
if
the
only
principle
behind
the
constitution's
venue
provisions
was
to
allow
the
defendant
to
be
tried
in
his
home
district,
which
one
may
assume
is
a
more
congenial
district.
it
balanced
that
with
the
other...
with
another
objective,
which
is
that
it
is
appropriate
to
bring
the
defendant
to
justice
in
the
place
where
he
has
conducted
his
criminal
activity,
and
if
a
defendant
undertakes,
voluntarily
undertakes
some
purposeful
activity
that
causes
harm
in
a
community
through
the
commission
of
a
criminal
conduct,
there's
nothing
in
the
venue
provisions
of
the
constitution
that
say
he
can't...
now...
he
can't
be--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--that
is
correct.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
use
and
carry.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
if
during
that...
if
during
your
kidnapping,
the
kidnapping
which
you
carry
out--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--you
use
and
possess
a
firearm,
uses
or...
use
or
carry
a
firearm,
you
get
an
additional
penalty,
but
the
penalty--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--correct.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
yes.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
the
separate
offense
is
using...
is...
you
must--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--right.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
let
me
say
on
that
point
that
it
is
almost
invariably
the
case
that
924(c)
charges
are
brought
in
conjunction
with
the
charges
for
the,
what
one
can
call
the
underlying
offense,
and
that
is
consistent
with
congress'
expectation
that
the
two
charges
would
be
brought
together,
because
it
viewed
924(c)
in
the
nature
of
an
enhanced
punishment
for
that
underlying
offense
that
was
aggravated
by
the
use
or
carrying
of
a
firearm
during
and
in
relation
to
it.
in
other
words,
congress
believed
that
when
someone
carries
out
this
crime
of
violence
or
drug
trafficking
crime,
that
is
more
deserving
of
punishment
because
it
was
accompanied
by
use
or
carrying
of
a
gun.
it
is
true
that
it
is
a
separate
offense.
the
element
has
to
be
proven
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
there
has
to
be
trial
by
jury
on
that
offense.
it's
not
a
sentencing
factor,
but
nonetheless,
it
is
so
closely
intertwined
with
the
underlying
offense
that
congress
really
saw
it
as
increased
punishment
for
the
nature
of
that
offense.
it's...
for
that
particular
offense.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
i'm
not
aware
of
any
discussion
about
cabrales
in
this
revision
of
924(c),
which
i
understand
was
more
directed
towards
the
bailey
issue
about
where
the
gun
is
possessed,
rather
than
the
more
active
type
of
uses
as
in
use
or
carry.
it's
not
that
uncommon
for
a...
for
one
of
the
underlying
crimes
which
924(c)
is
added
onto
to
be
carried
out
over
a
variety
of
states.
i
mean,
one
can
imagine
that
inter...
one
can
imagine
that
that
drug
conspiracy,
a
drug
distribution
conspiracy,
for
example,
that
was
based
in
boston,
and
as
part
of
that
conspiracy
someone
might
go
to
another
city,
miami
or
houston,
to
obtain
the
drugs
and
then
bring
them
back
to
boston.
he
might...
one
of
those
coconspirators
might
use
the
gun
while
obtaining
the
drugs,
and
i
think
it
would
be
strange
to
say
that
the...
that
if
congress
wanted
the
drug
conspiracy
and
the
924(c)
charge
to
be
tried
together,
i
think
it
would
be
odd
to
say
that
the
only
place
it
could
be
tried
was
in
the
city
where
the
drugs
had
been
obtained,
where
the
coconspirators
had
entered
for
just
a
moment,
when
the
base
of
operations
of
the
conspiracy
was,
say,
in
boston.
it's
that
conspiracy,
that
distribution
conspiracy
that
the
use
of
the
gun
made
worse,
and
that's
i
think
how
congress
really
looked
at
the
purpose
of
9...
looked
at
the
objective
which...
of
the
924(c)
offense
was
to
punish
that
aggravation.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
it
would...
the...
if...
it
is...
it's
not...
i
have
to
say,
under
this
court's
decisions,
it's
not
clear,
because
it's
true
that
they
satisfy
the
blockburger
test
that
the
kid...
the
924(c)
offense
contains
all
the
elements
of
the
kidnapping
offense
but
the
kidnapping
offense
doesn't
contain
any
that
the
924(c)--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--but
there
are
cases
of
this
court
which
have
said
that
in
certain
kinds
of
complex
type
crimes
like
this,
that
the
blockburger
test
may
not
be
fully
applicable.
i'm
not
aware
of
any
decided
case
law
in
the
lower
courts
in
this
subject,
but
i
believe
garrett
v.
united
states,
which
is
a
decision
of
this
court
that
talks
about
the
continuing
criminal
enterprise
statute,
suggests
that,
which
is
sort
of
similar
to
this
case
in
that
there
is
an
overall
statute
of
carrying
out
a
continuing
criminal
enterprise,
and
one
might
say
that
there
are
predicate
acts
of
that
that
are
the
commission
of
other
offenses,
and
there's
discussion
in
that
decision
that
says
that
the--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--i
believe
that's
the
case,
yes.
one
thing,
garrett
is
sort
of...
actually,
the
cce
type
crimes,
and
crimes
like
rico,
have
been
treated
by
the
lower
courts
roughly
similarly
to
the
approach
that
we've
suggested
in
this
case,
which
is
that...
take
rico,
for
example,
where
the
defendant
must
manage
the
affairs
of
an
enterprise
through
the
conduct
of
racketeering
activity.
the
approach
taken
by
the
lower
courts
is
that
the
defendant
can
be
brought
to
trial
wherever
any
of
those
predicate
acts
of
racketeering
activity
take
place,
and
though...
now,
though
there
may
be
situations
where
those
racketeering
acts
are
carried
out
in
more
than
one
state,
and
it's
viewed
as
appropriate
by
the
lower
courts
that
the
defendant
may
be
tried
on
the
overall
rico
statute
wherever
any
of
those...
any
of
those
racketeering
acts
were
committed.
similarly,
there
are
other
examples
where...
other
examples
of
offenses
with
multiple
elements.
another
example
is
the
travel
act,
which
prohibits
crossing
state
lines
with
an
intent
to
carry
out
certain
criminal
activity
and
thereafter
carrying
it
out
or
attempting
to
do
so,
and
the
courts
have
said...
the
lower
courts
have
said
that
the
defendant
may
be
prosecuted
either
where
he
leaves
or
where
he
arrives,
or
where
he
then
carries
out
the
criminal
act.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
the
hobbs
act?
the
hobbs
act
has
been
applied
to
allow
prosecution
wherever
the
obstructing
act
takes
place.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
the
lower
courts
have
said
that
a
hobbs
act
prosecution
may
be
brought
where
the
commerce
was
affected.
now,
the
government
would
have
to
prove--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--that's
correct.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
there
are...
no,
there
are
jurisdictional
requirements.
for
example,
the
possession
offenses
defined
by
922(g)
of
title
18,
which
prohibit
a
certain
number
of...
certain
classes
of
persons
from
possessing
a
gun
if
the
gun
has
traveled
in
interstate
commerce.
one
can't
prosecute
him
in
any
place
simply
because
the
gun
was
there.
that
is
a...
an
element
that
gives
the
federal
courts
jurisdiction.
it's
not
an
actus
reus
type
element
of
the
offense
on
which
venue
can
be
predicated.
but
the
hobbs
act
requires
that
one
obstruct...
one
commit
an
obstructive
act
and
thereby
affect
commerce,
and
the
courts
have
said...
the
lower
courts
have
said
that
the
effect
on
commerce
is
part
of
the
criminal
conduct
undertaken
by
the
defendant.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
i...
i--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--well,
one
does
have
to
prove...
i
mean,
the
government
does
have
to
prove
in
a
hobbs
act
prosecution
that
the
commerce
was
affected,
and
it's...
my
understanding
is
that--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--i'm
not
sure
that
the
courts
have
gone
so
far
as...
but
my
understanding
is
that
the
decisions
all
do
say
that
the...
it
may
be...
the
prosecution
may
be
brought
where
the
commerce
was
affected.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
i
think
that's
probably
correct,
yes.
the
court
of
appeals,
instead
of...
instead
of
looking
at
the
actual
nature
of
the
offense
laid
great
emphasis
on
the
fact
that
congress
had
only
used
the
active
verbs,
uses
and
carries,
in
defining
section
924(c),
and
that
approach,
what's
been
called
the
key
verb
test,
or
the
active
verb
test,
is
defective
because
it
makes
venue
turn
on
aspects
of
the
statute
that
are
really
immaterial,
do
not
go
to
the...
they
don't
capture
the
offense
that
congress
actually
defined
when
it
passed
924(c).
and
on
that
point,
as
judge
alito
pointed
out
in
the
dissent
below,
congress
could
have
easily
restated
the
offense
by
using
slightly
different
language,
but
if
to
have
reached
an
exactly
identical
result.
congress
could
have
said,
whoever
commits
a
crime
of
violence,
or...
commits
a
crime
of
violence
or
is
punishable...
and
is
punishable
therefor,
and
during
and
in
relation
to
that
crime
of
violence
uses
or
carries
a
firearm,
may
be
punished,
and
the
majority
in
the
court
of
appeals
agreed
that
the
defendant,
if
congress
had
stated
the
statute
that
way
that
the
defendant
could
be
prosecuted
in
new
jersey,
and
it
seems
odd
to
say
that
the
venue
decision
should
turn
on
just
certain
grammatical
aspects--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--no,
i--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--the
point
is
not
that
the
language
that
congress
chose
is
irrelevant.
i
mean,
clearly,
if
congress
chooses
one
verb
rather
than
another
it
may
be
getting
at
a
different
point.
i
mean,
there
are
cases,
for
example,
that
have
said,
if
congress
defines
an
offense
as
depositing
in
the
mails
rather
than
using
the
mails,
that
it
may
have...
it
may
have
been
aiming
at
a
particular--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--a
substantive
difference.
the
point
is,
where
everybody
agrees
what
the
offenses
are...
excuse
me,
what
the
actus
reus
elements
are
of
the
offense,
there's
not
really
any
disagreement
on
that,
i
don't
think,
it...
then
the
fact
that
congress
captured
it
with
one
active
verb
and
a
prepositional
phrase,
whereas
it
could
have
just
as
easily
been
restated
using
two
active
verbs,
should
not
affect
the
venue
outcome.
mr.
paul

wolfson
whoever--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--right.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
well,
in
that
case
it
would...
in
that
case,
if
i
understand
the
hypothetical
correctly,
there's
no
requirement
that
the
crime...
that
the
crime
actually
be
used
in
the
crime
of
violence.
it's
simply
carrying
a
gun,
you
know,
knowing...
having
some
evil
intent,
it
would
seem
that
the
crime
is
committed
where
the
gun
is
carried
and
the
knowledge
is
had.
if
it's
not
required
that
the
government
also
prove
that
the
gun
therefore
be
actually
used
by
the
defendant
in
the
commission
of
a
crime,
so
i
think
it
would
be
distinguishable
on
that,
on
that
point,
that--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--the
gun
was
used...
the
use
element
was
satis...
was
carried
out
in
maryland.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
the
kidnapping
began
in
texas,
continued
into
new
jersey,
and
was
completed
in
maryland.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
not
the
whole
case.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
we
couldn't
have
prosecuted
the
kidnapping
of
mrs.
avendano
in
maryland--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--because
she...
and
that's...
that
is...
and
she
was
not...
she
was
left
behind
in
new
jersey--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--when
the
kidnappers
went
on,
and
that
is
a...
there
is
an
independent
interest
that
the
government
has
in
punishing
that
offense.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
correct.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
that
is
correct.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
it
could
be
about
40
months'
difference.
it
could
be
from
12
to
40
months'
difference,
depending
on
where
the
district
court
chose
to
sentence
the
person
in...
within
the
guidelines
range.
that's
in
this
case.
i
do
also
want
to
say,
though,
that
this
defendant...
this
respondent
had
a
criminal
history
iii.
for
defendants
the
difference
grows
as
you
get
lower
down
in
the
criminal
history,
so
that
for
someone
with
less
criminal
history,
the
disparity
becomes
greater,
but
in
this
case
it's
between
12
and
40--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--right.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
right.
there
is
a
difference.
it's
12
to,
i
believe
it's
39...
12
would
be
12...
he
got
a
sentence
of
147
months,
and
under
the
situation
that
justice
scalia
posits
it
would
be
108
to
135
months,
but
the
disparity
grows
as
i
explained,
and
so
there
is...
i
mean,
there
is
a
substantial
difference,
and
that
reflects
the
fact
that
congress
imposed
what
is
a
rather
strict
penalty.
it's
a...
in
924(c).
it's
a
5-year
mandatory
add-on.
it
can't
be...
it
has
to
be
consecutive.
it
can't
be
paroled.
it
doesn't
matter
whether...
you
know,
it
applies
even
whether
the
defendant...
whether
the
offense
contains
its
own
enhancement
statutory
element
for
use
of
a
dangerous
weapon,
or
use
of
a
firearm,
but
it
is...
congress
did
view
it
as
a
very
serious
matter
when
an
offense
is
aggravated
through
the
use
of
a
firearm.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
right.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
on
page
18a
of
the
petition
appendix
the
court
said,
in
the
specific
context
of
section
924(c),
congress
could
have
drafted...
i'm
sorry.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
i'm
sorry.
it's
at
the
very
top
of
the
page.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
18a
of
the
petition
appendix.
congress
could
have
drafted
the
statute
to
allow
venue
to
lie
in
any
district
where
the
government
could
properly
bring
the
related
crime
of
violence
or
drug-trafficking
offense,
and
then
there's
a
footnote,
footnote
80(d),
the
defense
artfully
suggests
how
such
a
statute
might
be
written,
and
then
the
court
goes
on
to
say,
congress
did
not
do
so.
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
unless
there
are
any
questions,
i
have
nothing
further.
thank
you.
