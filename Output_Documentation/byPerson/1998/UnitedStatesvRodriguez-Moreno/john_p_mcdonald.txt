mr.
john
p.
mcdonald
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
there
is
no
escape
from
the
logic
that
a
924(c)(1)
violation
is
not
committed
unless
and
until
a
firearm
is
used
or
carried.
when
or
where
the
underlying
predicate
offense
began
is
simply
unimportant.
mr.
john
p.
mcdonald
that's
correct,
your
honor.
you
have
to
have...
924(c)
is
a
point-in-time
offense.
it
is
not
necessarily
a
continuing
offense.
it
occurs
only
when
and
only
where
the
weapon
is
used
during
and
in
relation
to
the
underlying
crime
of
violence.
venue,
in
our
opinion,
can
never
relate
back
to
the
anterior
or
predicate
offense.
mr.
john
p.
mcdonald
had
mr.
moreno
used
a
weapon
at
the
inception
of
the
kidnapping,
and
had
he
kept
it
with
him,
then
he
would...
924(c)
under
those
circumstances
would
be
a
continuing
offense,
and
he
could
simply
be
prosecuted--
mr.
john
p.
mcdonald
--the
underlying
crime
of
kidnapping
is
a
continuing
offense.
this
court's
analysis
of
the
statute
in
bailey
said,
and
these
other
cases
in
busic
and
simpson
a
number
of
years
ago,
clearly
said
that
this
not
a
sentencing
enhancement.
924(c)
is
a
separate
and
distinct
crime,
and
the--
mr.
john
p.
mcdonald
--that's
correct.
mr.
john
p.
mcdonald
under
those
set
of
facts
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
john
p.
mcdonald
it
is
limited
by
the
time
and
place
that
they
are
together
as
one.
mr.
john
p.
mcdonald
that's
correct,
your
honor.
under
the
facts
of
this
case,
the
924(c)
violation
probably
occurred
in
about
1
minute.
mr.
moreno,
out
of
a
sense
of
desperation,
threatened
a...
the...
mr.
avendano
with
the
gun.
shortly
thereafter,
at
the
same
time--
mr.
john
p.
mcdonald
--out
of
a
sense
of
frustration,
he
pulled
the
weapon
and
used
it,
your
honor.
immediately
thereafter,
one
of
his
codefendants
said,
don't
do
it,
this
is
not
the
way
we're
conducting
ourselves,
words
to
that
effect
which
are
on
page
27
of
the
joint
appendix.
mr.
john
p.
mcdonald
it--
mr.
john
p.
mcdonald
--there
is
a
case
on
point.
mr.
john
p.
mcdonald
midstate
horticultural.
it's
this
court's
opinion
in
1939,
and
if
i
may,
it
was
an
elkins
act
prosecution.
the
elkins
act
prohibited
the
illegal
payments
of
rebates
in
interstate
rail
shipping.
it
was
a
very
broad
venue
provision
under
that
statute,
and
it
said,
in
essence,
that
the
crime
could
be
charged
anywhere
where
either
the
payment
was
made
or
received,
or
anywhere
where
the
shipment
took
place
in
any
state,
similar
to
this
case.
when
the
court
of...
when
this
court
had
the
case
in
1939,
it
was
a
unique
set
of
facts.
the
facts
were,
your
honor,
that
the
shipment
had
been
made
in
1932
and
1933
from
california
to
new
jersey,
but
the
payment
was
only
made
in
1935
in
the
city
of
new
york,
and
the
case
was
tried
in
philadelphia,
and
this
court
said
no,
you
can't
do
that.
they
said
that
you
must
look
at
the
acts
of
the
accused,
where
they
were
committed,
and
that
is
where
venue
was
laid.
mr.
john
p.
mcdonald
there
were...
yes.
the--
mr.
john
p.
mcdonald
--that's
correct.
the
elements...
the
other
element
of
the
crime
was
the
interstate
shipment,
and
in
that
case,
that
part
of
the
crime
occurred
from
california
to
new
jersey,
and
in
every
state,
and
as
this
case
found
in
armour
packing,
30
years
before
that
in
1909,
that
had
the
payment
been
made
before,
and
the
shipping
continued,
it
could
be
tried
in
any
case
through
which
the
shipments
proceeded.
mr.
john
p.
mcdonald
well,
your
honor,
i
believe
that
cabrales
supports
our
position.
what
cabrales
said
was,
in
cabrales
the
money
laundering
had
to
be
the
result
of
an
illegal
crime.
that
was
part
of
the
statute,
that
it
had
to
be...
at
least
for
the
957,
that
there
had
to
be
shown
that
the
money
was
illegally
obtained.
mr.
john
p.
mcdonald
that's
correct,
your
honor,
but
what
this
court
said
was,
look
at
cabrales
and
what
she
did,
and
where
she
did
it,
and
what
happened
before
is
not
important.
it
is
not
necessary
for
the
conviction
of
the--
mr.
john
p.
mcdonald
--well,
it
was,
in
fact,
an
after-the-fact
crime.
that
was
set
forth
in
the
opinion.
here,
if
the
government's
theory
on
where
venue
can
be
laid
under...
where
either
the
kidnapping
took
place
or
either
the
gun
was
used,
and
takes
out
the
during
and
in
relation
to
argument,
then
venue
could
be
laid
in
any
number
of
states
all
over
the
country,
and
is
not
limited
by
the
words,
during
and
in
relation
to.
mr.
john
p.
mcdonald
no,
your
honor.
venue
must
be
determined
on
each
count
in
the
indictment
separately,
and
just
merely
because
three
or
four
counts
in
the
indictment
confer
venue
in
one
place
and
one
does
not,
there's
no
practical
application
that
permits
the
court
to
try
them
all
in
one
place.
that
is
simply
what
the
constitution
does
not
permit.
mr.
john
p.
mcdonald
i
believe
it
is.
that
is
nothing
more
than
a
sentencing
enhancement
at
that
point.
it
is
no
longer
a
separate
and
distinct
crime.
your
honor,
it
seems
that
everybody
wants
to
rewrite
this
statute.
the
dissent
wanted
to
rewrite
it,
the
government
wants
to
rewrite
it,
and
congress
has,
in
fact,
in
the
last
month
rewritten
the
statute,
but
that's
not
the
statute
under
which
mr.
moreno
was
tried
and
convicted.
mr.
john
p.
mcdonald
no,
your
honor,
because--
mr.
john
p.
mcdonald
--i
don't
believe
so,
your
honor,
because
no
matter
how
you
rewrite
the
statute,
you...
i
don't
believe
that
you
can
escape
the
clear
language
that
the
gun
must
be
used
during
and
in
relation
to
an
underlying
crime
of
violence.
mr.
john
p.
mcdonald
well,
your
honor,
it
would
be
our
position
that
that
would...
trial
would
still
have
to
be
held
in
the
place
where
the
gun
was
used
during
and
in
relation
to
the
underlying
felony.
mr.
john
p.
mcdonald
is
it
an
easier
case
for
the
government
under
the
statute
the
way
it
is...
would
be
rewritten?
yes.
i
think
that
the...
you
could
argue--
mr.
john
p.
mcdonald
--i
believe
they
would,
your
honor.
mr.
john
p.
mcdonald
that
is
part
of
it.
mr.
john
p.
mcdonald
that
is
right,
your
honor.
mr.
moreno
was
tried
and
convicted
and
punished
for
kidnapping.
that
was
a
continuing
offense,
and
it
could
have
been
tried
in
any
number
of
districts
in
this
united
states.
it
is
only
when
it
comes
together
with
the
gun,
when
he
begins
to
use
the
weapon,
as
this
court
said
in
bailey,
when
he
torques
up
the
stakes,
when
he
makes
it
more
dangerous,
when
he
commits
another
offense,
that
is
when
924(c)(1)
begins,
and
not
a
moment
before.
we
believe
that
the
cabrales
decision
warrants
rejection
of
the
government's
position
in
this
case.
the
government's
petition
for
certiorari
in
this
case
recognizes
the
cabrales
decision
would
be
dispositive
of
this
case,
and
they
ask
that
the
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari
be
held
pending
the
court's
disposition
in
u.s.
v.
cabrales,
and
disposed
of
as
appropriate
in
light
of
the
resolution
of
that
case.
now,
at
that
time
the
decision
had
not
been
written,
and
i
understand
that,
but
cabrales
simply
said,
it
reaffirmed
this
court's
rulings
for
the
last
90
years,
particularly
that
cite...
the
standard
cited
in
anderson,
and
it
said,
you
must
look
to
where
the
acts
of
the
accused,
what
acts
were
committed
and
violated
the
statute
in
question.
mr.
john
p.
mcdonald
if
cabrales
had--
mr.
john
p.
mcdonald
--in
favor
of
the
government.
mr.
john
p.
mcdonald
then
i
imagine
that
they
were
asking
that
it
be
remanded
to
the
third
circuit
court
of
appeals
in...
for
determination
and
resolution
in
recognition
of
that
holding,
because
we
prevailed
in
the
third
circuit.
mr.
john
p.
mcdonald
and
had
the
court
just
simply
denied
cert,
we
would
still
prevail.
am
i
answering
your
question,
your
honor?
mr.
john
p.
mcdonald
the
active--
mr.
john
p.
mcdonald
--i
think
the
active
verb
test
has
best
been
described
by
the
courts
of
appeals
and
the
authorities
as
a
very
good
first
cut
at
understanding
the
statute.
most
of
the
courts
of
appeals
have
not
held
that
it
is
an
exclusive
analysis
of
any
criminal
case,
but
they
have
held
that
it
is
something
that
they
utilize
in
their
examination
of
the
statute
as
to
where
venue
should
lie.
if
this
court
adopted
the
active
verb
test,
and
the
active
verbs
in
this
case
are
use
and
carry,
we
would
prevail
without
much
further
discussion.
it
dawned
on
us
that
there
are
a
number
of
circuits
that
have
adopted
this
test,
but
this
court...
that
test,
but
this
court
has
not.
if
this
court
adopts
that
test,
i
believe
that
we
would
prevail
under
that
test.
it
is
a
straightforward
test.
mr.
john
p.
mcdonald
in
that
respect,
it
is--
mr.
john
p.
mcdonald
--well,
if
you
consider
the
essential
elements,
it
is
true
that
in
midstate
horticultural
the
underlying
essential
element
was
not
criminal
in
and
of
itself,
but
it
was
still
an
essential
element
of
the
offense.
here,
the
kidnapping
is
an
essential
element
of
the
offense.
it
happens
to
be
criminal.
mr.
john
p.
mcdonald
well,
under
the
elkins
act,
most
of
those
offenses...
and
as
this
court
has
said
time
and
again
in
venue
cases,
they
are
fact-sensitive
and
we
must
look
closely
at
the
facts
of
the
case.
in
almost
all
the
elkins
act
prosecutions
it
was
a
continuing
offense.
it
was
an
offense
that
started
with
the
payment
or
receipt
of
an
illegal
gratuity,
or
a
kick-back,
and
then
that
offense
occurred
each
and
every
placed
that
the
goods
were
shipped,
so
for
that...
for
the
reasons
of
that
statute,
it
would
be
a
continuing
offense.
here--
mr.
john
p.
mcdonald
--well,
under
the
armour--
mr.
john
p.
mcdonald
--well,
your
honor,
if
you
read
the
armour
packing
case,
the
armour
packing
case
said
that
under
the
elkins
act
the...
it
could
well
be
a
continuing...
it
is
a
continuing
offense,
under...
through
each
and
every
state
that
the
transportation
occurred,
and
that
was
by
statute.
the
venue
provisions
there
were
very,
very
broad.
mr.
john
p.
mcdonald
i
don't
believe
that
there
is
a
case
one
way
or
the
other
for
a
point-in-time
case.
mr.
john
p.
mcdonald
well,
there
are
no
cases
that
i
know
of
that
have
held
that,
but
what
the
cases
have
said
is
that
you
must
look
at
the
acts
of
the
accused,
and
they
are
fact-specific,
and
i
don't
know
of...
i'm
trying
to
think
of
cases
where
the
defendant
where
it'd
be
as
fact-specific
as
this,
where
the
gun
and
the
kidnapping
came
together
only
in
one
place
and
only
at
one
time.
mr.
john
p.
mcdonald
that
if...
if
the
elements
all
must
come
together
under
that
particular
statute,
and
that
is
what
the
statute
says,
that
they
must
come
together
at
some
point
in
time,
then
it
is
only
in
that
place
where
they
came
together
at
a
point
in
time
where
venue
is
proper.
that
would
be
the
ruling
that
i
would
suggest.
if
there
are
no
further
questions--
mr.
john
p.
mcdonald
--thank
you.
