ms.
corbett
gordon
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
our
case
addresses
both
the
issue
of
disability
and
the
issue
of
qualification.
a
functional
analysis
is
required
by
a
plain
reading
of
the
statute
and
under
this
court's
decision
in
bragdon.
defining
the
impairment,
simply
naming
the
condition,
here
monocularity,
does
not
end
that
analysis.
a
functional
analysis
establishes
whether
the
impairment
substantially
limits
the
major
life
activity.
the
ninth
circuit
held
that
mr.
kirkingburg
is
disabled
because
he
sees
differently
from
other
people,
not
because
he
sees
substantially...
in
a
substantially
restricted
or
a
substantially
limited
manner.
mr.
kirkingburg
sees
with
one
eye
almost
everything
that
an
average
person
in
the
general
population
sees
with
two
eyes.
he
lacks
peripheral
vision
and
he
lacks
some
cues
for
depth
perception.
here
mr.
kirkingburg
claims
that
his
own
mind
has
compensated
and
helped
him
in
terms
of
depth
perception,
by
giving
him
an
enhanced
ability
to
use
monocular
cues.
viewing
mr.
kirkingburg's
seeing
functionally
then,
he's
not
substantially
limited
in
the
major
life
activity
of
seeing.
he
is
impaired
because
he
sees
differently.
ms.
corbett
gordon
that's
correct,
justice
o'connor.
ms.
corbett
gordon
that's
correct.
ms.
corbett
gordon
that's
correct.
ms.
corbett
gordon
that's
i
believe
appropriately
before
this
court
because
the
ninth
circuit
ruled
on
that
question
and
found
him
to
be
disabled.
ms.
corbett
gordon
that's
correct.
ms.
corbett
gordon
i
think
the
ninth
circuit
is
certainly
wrong
on
that
question,
and
this
court
has
before
it
other
issues
that
came
up
on
cert.--
ms.
corbett
gordon
--the
ninth...
i'm
sorry,
justice
ginsburg.
ms.
corbett
gordon
that's...
that's
correct,
and
the
ninth
circuit
remanded
on
regarded
as
and
on
the
qualification
issue--
ms.
corbett
gordon
--and
found
against
the
company
and
in
favor
of
mr.
kirkingburg
on
his
disability
question.
ms.
corbett
gordon
that's
correct.
ms.
corbett
gordon
well,
i
think
we're
entitled
to
more
than
that,
justice
ginsburg,
because
the
qualification
standard
is
the
standard
that
was
tried
to
the
district
court.
the
district
court
gave
summary
judgment
on
that.
it
can
be
decided
as
a
matter
of
law.
it
was
brought
before
this
court
on
a
petition,
and
we
believe
this
court
can
go
ahead
and
decide
that
as
well.
and
the...
and
the
fact
in
this
case
is
that
this
employer
had
a
qualification
standard,
which
the
statute
allows
it
to
have,
that
was
based
in
safety
and
it
was
applied
to
everyone,
but
you
had
to
have
20/40
vision
in
each
eye
independently
in
order
to
drive
a
truck
for
the
company.
that
standard
is
the
same
standard
that
the
department
of
transportation,
the
dot,
has
in
its
regulations
for
truck
drivers.
there's
nothing
arbitrary
or
capricious
about
that
standard.
ms.
corbett
gordon
yes,
mr.
chief
justice.
the
respondent
later
got
a
waiver.
at
the
time
that
he
was
let
go
by
the
company,
he
didn't
have
a
waiver.
and
the
waiver
is
only
a
license
to
drive
in
an
experimental
program
that
went
into
effect
that...
earlier
that
year
to
try
to
develop
empirical
data
by
which
the
federal
highway
association
was
trying
to
see
if
it
had
enough
evidence
to
lower
the
20/40
each
eye
standard.
it
never
got
that
evidence.
it
never
developed
that,
and
the
standard
has
never
been
lowered.
ms.
corbett
gordon
the
waiver
has
been
grandfathered
in
for
people
that
got
it
during
that
period
of
time
who
kept
up
their
reporting
procedures,
and
the
record
ends,
of
course,
at
the
point
when
discovery
closed.
so,
it--
ms.
corbett
gordon
--well,
if...
this
case
was
taken
on
the
petition
for
certiorari
which
questions
the
waiver
as
a
reasonable
accommodation.
i
don't
agree,
respectfully,
justice
o'connor,
that
you
can
say
that
this
waiver
was
valid
at
the
time.
that
validity
would
imply,
as
the
ninth
circuit
majority
said,
that
this
person
was
deemed
to
be
safe
in
some
way
when,
in
fact,
that's
not
what
the
waiver
program
did.
it
simply
gave
people
with
diminished
visual
abilities
an
opportunity
to
help
the
government
prove
whether
they
were
safe
or
not.
and
in
1994
in
the
advocates
case,
the
d.c.
circuit
found
that
that
waiver
program
was
invalid.
ms.
corbett
gordon
i
agree
that
the
waiver
gave
him
a
license
to
drive
recognized
by
the
federal
government.
ms.
corbett
gordon
i
think
that
is...
that
is
the
position
under
the
statute
itself.
a
qualification
standard
may
be
set
by
the
employer,
and
the
eeoc
has
applied
that
both
to
safety
type
standards,
such
as
this
one,
and
production
type
standards.
ms.
corbett
gordon
i
think
the
reasonableness
limitations
are
twofold
on
the
face
of
the
statute.
the
standard
must
be
job
related
and
consistent
with
business
necessity,
and
the
second
test
is
whether
it
meets
the
direct
threat
test
if
it's
a
safety
issue.
the
standard
in
this
case
meets
both
of
those
tests.
ms.
corbett
gordon
i
think--
ms.
corbett
gordon
--possibly
that
would
be
the
answer,
but
i
would
suggest
that
the
eeoc
itself
has
given
another
defense,
and
that
is
in
the
technical
assistance
manual
at
page
4-16,
they
say
that
if
you
have
a
government
regulation
that
requires
an
employer
to
have
a
certain
standard,
if
the
employer
is
following
that
standard,
which
this
employer
was
doing
at
that
time
and
continues
to
do,
that
that
operates
as
a
defense
and
you
don't
have
to
look
at
the
business...
the
job
related
and
business
necessity
test.
ms.
corbett
gordon
yes.
i--
ms.
corbett
gordon
--there
are
a
lot
of
regulations
on
the
ada
that
the
eeoc
has
promulgated,
but
i
haven't
found
that
example--
ms.
corbett
gordon
--i
don't
think
so
because
i
think
you
can
find,
as
a
matter
of
law,
that
when
safety
is
an
issue
and
an
agency
has
issued
a
mandatory
safety
requirement...
and
again,
the
waiver
program
was
not
deemed
safe.
when
you're
following
a
mandatory
safety
requirement,
i
think
the
employer
is...
is
entitled
to
an
absolute
defense.
if
this
employer
is
found
not
to
be
entitled
to
an
absolute
defense,
however,
it
can
easily
meet
both
the
job
related
and
business
necessity
test
and
the
direct
threat
test.
ms.
corbett
gordon
certainly
this
court
can
take
care
of
this
case
as
a
matter
of
law
if
you
go
with
the
mandatory
defense.
if
you
go
to
the
balancing
tests
basically
that
are
developed
under
the...
the
direct
threat
test,
for
instance,
the
record
before
this
court--
ms.
corbett
gordon
--i'm
sorry.
ms.
corbett
gordon
that's
correct.
ms.
corbett
gordon
our
position
on
that
is
that
it's
reasonably
included
in
the
first
question
presented.
ms.
corbett
gordon
disabled
per
se.
the
definition
of
disabled
has
three
prongs.
ms.
corbett
gordon
as
a
matter
of
law.
ms.
corbett
gordon
that's
a
direct--
ms.
corbett
gordon
--no.
they
were
thrown
in
there
because
of
the
ninth
circuit's
majority
opinion
and
the
manner
in
which
it
was
decided.
ms.
corbett
gordon
actually--
ms.
corbett
gordon
--that's
exactly
right.
we
would
have
to
show
both
prong
one
and
prong
three.
ms.
corbett
gordon
you
could
say
every
little
bit
helps,
and--
ms.
corbett
gordon
--the
qualified
portion
of
our
defense
certainly
would
take
care
of
either
one
of
those
first
two
questions.
ms.
corbett
gordon
that's
correct.
ms.
corbett
gordon
that's
right.
ms.
corbett
gordon
that's
right.
we
perhaps
didn't
state
it
as
artfully
as
we
could
have
in
our
petition,
and
we
clarified
it--
ms.
corbett
gordon
--the
ninth
circuit
made
a
per
se
decision
in
terms
of
prong
one.
the
manner
in
which
they
analyzed
it
was
a
per
se
analysis,
and
that's--
ms.
corbett
gordon
--yes.
they
basically
said...
they
defined
mr.
kirkingburg
as
monocular.
they
relied
on
secondary
sources,
and
then
they
said
people
with...
people
who
see
out
of
one
eye
rather
than
two
are
substantially
limited
because
they
see
differently.
so,
i
think
they
made
a,
what
i
consider,
per
se
or
matter
of
law
ruling
on
a
monocular
individual
without
doing
the
functional
analysis
on
this
individual
and
what
this
individual
is
able
or
unable
to
do.
how
can
we
find
someone
is
not
disabled
who
sees
with
only
one
eye
and
then
turn
around
and
say
that
that
same
person
is
not
qualified
to
drive
a
truck
for
a
company?
the
way
we
reach
that
analysis
is
this.
mr.
kirkingburg
sees
almost
everything
that
other
people
see.
the
very
things
that
he's
lacking
are
the
elements
that
are
so
important
in
driving
a
truck
for
the
company.
it's
the
peripheral
vision
and
it's
the
lack
of
some
cues
of
depth
perception
that
are
particular
to
this
job.
and
that's
how
we
get
out
of
the,
as
it's
sometimes
been
described,
as
a
catch-22
situation
of
saying
that
this
man
is
only
impaired
and
yet
impaired
enough
that
he
can't
do
this
job.
there
is
no
reasonable
accommodation
that
will
raise
mr.
kirkingburg's
vision
to
the
level
that
this
company
requires.
there
is
no
ramp.
there
is
no
wrist
rest.
there's
no
type
of
reasonable
accommodation
as
it
is
often
thought
of
that
will
increase
his
vision
in
his
left
eye.
ms.
corbett
gordon
the
company
isn't
regarding
him
as
disabled
for
two
reasons.
first,
they
offered
him
other
employment.
they
didn't
view
him
as
unemployable.
they
viewed
him
as
unqualified
for
this
particular
job
in
the
manner
i've
just
described
in
employing
the
qualification
standard.
also--
ms.
corbett
gordon
--they
offered
him
the
tire
mechanic
job
and
the
pay
differential
was
a
little
more
than
a
dollar
an
hour.
and
you
find
that
in
the
joint
appendix
at
page
396.
the
driver's
salary
was
$14.21
per
hour.
the
tire
mechanic's
salary,
$13.05
per
hour.
ms.
corbett
gordon
that's
any
driver.
ms.
corbett
gordon
yes.
the
company's
rule
is
the
same
for
any
driver.
okay.
so,
there
is
no
reasonable
accommodation
that
will
raise
this
man's
vision
with
or
without
correction
to
the
level
that
the
company
requires.
both
the
motor
carrier
safety
act
and
the
americans
with
disabilities
act
have
recognized
that
an
employer
has
the
right
to
set
a
qualification
standard,
and
the
eeoc
has
expressly
allowed
an
employer
to
follow
a
standard
that's
required
by
law.
ms.
corbett
gordon
tire
mechanic?
ms.
corbett
gordon
i
think
it
would
be
a
tougher--
ms.
corbett
gordon
--i'm
not
sure
that
that
isn't
correct,
justice
scalia.
and
the
reason
for
that
is
the
way
the
test
is
set
up,
that
if
they
don't
perceive
him
as
substantially
limited
in
the
major
life
activities
certainly
that
have
been
raised
in
this
case,
working
or
seeing,
then
they
necessarily
aren't
perceiving
him
as
disabled.
ms.
corbett
gordon
well,
there
are
subcategories
within
working.
i
would
submit
that
they're
not
as
narrow
as
driving
a
truck
for
this
one
company.
ms.
corbett
gordon
i
would
suggest
that
with
reference
to
driving
as
a
subcategory
of
the
major
life
activity
of
working,
that
it
may
be
helpful
to
look
at
all
driving,
someone
who
can't
do
leisure
driving,
someone
who
can't
drive
at
all,
so
would
be
completely
unemployable
in
any
category
of
driving.
in
this
case,
this
particular
man
had
a
steady
history
of
employment,
including
driving,
up
to
the
time
that
he
came
to
this
company
and
after
he
left.
ms.
corbett
gordon
the--
ms.
corbett
gordon
--the
eeoc
would
suggest
i
think
that
that
is
too
broad
if
you
look
at
the
entire
national
economy,
and
i
can't
say
that
i
would
disagree
with
that.
however,
looking
at
a
narrow
category
of
jobs
like
truck
driver
that
requires
visual
acuity
of
20/40
in
each
eye,
i
think
that
is
too
narrow
a
category
to
say
that
this
man
is
precluded
from
engaging
in
the
major
life
activity
of
working.
ms.
corbett
gordon
well,
the
median
seems
to...
as
it
percolates
up
through
the
courts
in
regards
to
driving
and
in
regard
to
working
as
a
major
life
activity,
most
of
the
courts
that
have
examined
it
are
looking
at
it
more
broadly
than
simply
saying
driving
in
one
job
category.
ms.
corbett
gordon
they're
doing
it
as
a
matter
of
law.
ms.
corbett
gordon
yes.
ms.
corbett
gordon
my
answer
to
seeing,
justice
o'connor,
is
that
i
think
this
record
is
clear
that
this
employer
didn't
perceive
this
individual
as
unable
to
see
or
substantially
restricted
in
seeing
because
the
other
jobs
offered
him
required
someone
can
see.
ms.
corbett
gordon
i
do
say
that
the
job
of
truck
driver
for
this
company
is
a
single,
particular
job,
and
there
are
lots
of
other
kinds,
van
driving--
ms.
corbett
gordon
--you
don't
get...
you
don't
get
to
the
is
he
qualified
question
if
he's
found
not
to
be
disabled
and
not
to
be
perceived
as
disabled.
that's
correct.
the
analysis
would
end
there.
ms.
corbett
gordon
well,
clearly
in
this
case,
this
employer
perceived
him
as
able
to
work
in
other
positions
for
this
employer,
so
it
didn't
perceive
him--
ms.
corbett
gordon
--well,
that's
one
of
the
criteria.
ms.
corbett
gordon
and
another
is
to
look
at
whether
this
person
is
employable
in
that
geographic
area,
which
is
one
of
the
things
the
eeoc
directs
us
to
look
at.
ms.
corbett
gordon
but--
ms.
corbett
gordon
--well,
the
guidelines--
ms.
corbett
gordon
--the
guidelines
would
say
that
we
look
at
his
training,
his
skills,
his
other
background
and
talents,
and
i...
i
would
suggest
that
in
that
case,
that
doctor
could
learn
to
operate
on
other
close
body
parts.
ms.
corbett
gordon
i
think
the
correct
analysis
is
to
look
at
the
mental
status
of
the
employer
and
whether...
and
what
the
perception
of
the
employer
was
when
you're
looking
at
the
regarded
as
prong.
that's
where
the
focus
should
be.
ms.
corbett
gordon
a
subjective
test
based
on
the
evidence
in
the
record
as
to
what
that
employer
was
doing
or
thinking,
yes.
ms.
corbett
gordon
well,
not...
i
don't
believe
entirely
because
how
you
treat
someone
is
indicative
of
how
you're
thinking
about
the
person.
ms.
corbett
gordon
they
treated
him
as
if
he
were
substantially
limited
in
a
major
life
activity.
ms.
corbett
gordon
therefore--
ms.
corbett
gordon
--i
think
it
has
to
come
back
to
intent
because
the...
because
of
the
use
of
the
word
regarded
in
the
statute.
ms.
corbett
gordon
on
the
facts
in
this
record,
that
statement
was
made
after
the
decision
was
made
to
terminate
mr.
kirkingburg's
employment,
and
so
the
statement
itself
is
not
causally
linked
to
the...
to
the
decision
of
the
act
that's
now
claimed
to
be
discriminatory.
ms.
corbett
gordon
i
think
the...
the
statement
is
better
understood
as
simply
defining
the...
the
impairment
that
this
individual
has.
he
is
legally
blind
in
one
eye.
ms.
corbett
gordon
the...
the
test
for
the
difference
between
an
impairment
up
to
some
level
and
then
above
it
is
20/200.
ms.
corbett
gordon
i
haven't
found
it
articulated
and
i--
ms.
corbett
gordon
--in
various
materials,
that
is
the
term
that's
applied.
ms.
corbett
gordon
secondary
studies.
i
can't
point
you
to
one
now,
but
it's
not
something
that
arose
for
the
first
time
in
this
case.
it's
a
term
that
has
been
generally
used
to
depict
someone
who...
as
a
level
of...
if
you're
uncorrected
at
that
level.
ms.
corbett
gordon
i...
i
agree
it
is.
ms.
corbett
gordon
i
think
it
may
be
the
benefits
and
the
tax
statutes,
but
i...
i
can't
cite
you
to
one
particularly
at
this
time.
thank
you.
ms.
corbett
gordon
yes,
thank
you.
ms.
corbett
gordon
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
just
have
two
brief
points
i'd
like
to
address
responding
to
points
made
by
mr.
hunt.
first,
he
was
talking
about
the
waiver
program
as
a
proxy
for
safety,
and
i
would
like
to
call
the
court's
attention
to
some
things
in
the
federal
register.
at
59
federal
register
59388,
the
federal
highway
administration
recognized
that
its
study
was
flawed
and
has
admitted
that
some
of
the
waiver
drivers
were
sub
par
performers
who
individually
may
represent
an
unacceptable
risk
to
safety.
that
federal
register
entry
was
in
november
of
1994
after
mr.
kirkingburg
got
his
waiver.
their
own
panel
of
doctors
that
advises
the
federal
highway
administration
and
other
studies
and
advisors
over
the
years,
as
recently
as
october
of
last
fall,
have
advised
the
federal
highway
administration
not
to
change
the
20/40
each
eye
acuity
standard.
in
fact,
that
standard
or
a
like
standard
has
been
in
place
since
1935,
starting
with
good
vision
is
important
to
safe
driving.
ms.
corbett
gordon
i
can't.
ms.
corbett
gordon
i
can't.
in
the
same
breath,
the
federal
highway
administration
declared
the
current
people
in
1996
to
be
sufficiently
safe
to
grandfather
them,
and...
and
i
can't
reconcile
that.
ms.
corbett
gordon
i
would
refer
the
court
to
pages
12
to
16
of
our
reply
brief
where
various
criticisms
are
taken
of
the
federal
highway
administration's
protocol
and
studies
that
were
in
effect
and
available
to
them
and
noted
in
their...
in
the
federal
register
that
they
ignored.
the
other
thing
i'd
like
to
address
very
quickly
is
the
fact
that
i
do
not
believe
that
the
comment,
he
is
legally
blind
or
blind
in
one
eye,
is
susceptible
to
construing
the
term
legally
blind
separate
from
the
phrase
or
blind
in
one
eye.
thank
you.
