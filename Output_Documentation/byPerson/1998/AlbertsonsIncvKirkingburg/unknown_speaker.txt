unknown
speaker
let...
let
me
talk
about
what
we
have
before
us
here
for
just
a
minute.
i
think
your
client
asked
for
summary
judgment
at
the
trial
court
level.
unknown
speaker
and
only
on
the
grounds
that
the
respondent
was
not
qualified
for
driving?
unknown
speaker
and
did
not
ask
for
summary
judgment
on
the
issue
of
whether
the
respondent
was
disabled.
unknown
speaker
and
yet,
on
cert,
we
are
to
address
whether
he
was
disabled.
unknown
speaker
how
could
the
ninth
circuit
have...
ninth
circuit
grants
a
summary
judgment
to
the
other
side
or
to...
grants...
says
that
the
other
side
should
get
summary
judgment
when
they
didn't
ask
for
it
and
you
didn't
ask
for
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
then
isn't
the
obvious
thing
to
do,
we
say
they're
wrong
on
that
and
just
send
it
back
and
try
it
out?
unknown
speaker
the
ninth
circuit
remanded.
it
didn't...
it
didn't
throw
it
out.
the
ninth
circuit
said--
unknown
speaker
--go
back
and...
and
do
something
more
on
the
qualified
issue.
you...
you
went
for
summary
judgment.
you
skipped
over
disability.
you
skipped
over
the
perceived
as
or--
--regarded
as.
--regarded
as.
you
went
directly
to
the
third
thing
that
the
plaintiff
has
to
show
and
said,
he
can't
show
it
but
he's
qualified.
right?
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
that...
that's
the
only
one
that
was
a
judgment,
not...
not
a
question
open
for
the
district
court.
it
was
only--
unknown
speaker
--and
the...
so,
if
we
were
to
say
the
ninth
circuit
was
wrong
on
that,
then
everything
else
should
go
back.
if
we
said
the
ninth
circuit
was
wrong
in
saying
disabled
means
does
it
differently,
if
we
just
said
that...
that,
why...
why
is
your...
are
you
entitled
to
anything
more
than
that?
unknown
speaker
but...
but
the
ninth...
the
ninth
circuit,
ms.
gordon,
said
that
the
dot
provided
waivers
under
certain
circumstances
and
the
respondent
got
a
waiver?
unknown
speaker
and...
so...
and
did
the
waiver
expire
or--
unknown
speaker
--but
we
take
this
case
on
the
basis
that
the
respondent
did
obtain
a
waiver
from
dot
and
a
valid
waiver
at
the
time.
right?
unknown
speaker
do
you
acknowledge
at...
at
the
time
the
employee
obtained
the
waiver,
albertsons
could
have
hired
him
to
drive
a
truck
if
it
had
chosen
to
do
so,
relying
on
the
waiver?
unknown
speaker
is
it
your
position
that
albertsons
has
a
right
to
set
a
safety
standard,
in
effect,
with
the
same
unreviewable
autonomy
that
the
regs
give
a...
a
manufacturer
the
right
to
set
production
standards?
is...
is
that
basically
your
point?
unknown
speaker
but
you
don't...
you
don't
concede
that
there
is,
in
effect,
any
reasonableness
limitation
on
the
standards
that
you
can
set?
unknown
speaker
but
doesn't
this
just
mean
there's
another
issue
for
trial?
i
mean,
if...
if
there
were
no
waiver,
your...
your
client
could
say,
well,
i
just
relied
on
the
dot
and
the
dot
says
they're
not
safe.
and...
but
if
there's
a
waiver,
what
the
waiver
means
is
dot
isn't
saying,
given
the
nature
of
this
program,
they
are
safe.
dot
is
saying
we're
not
sure.
unknown
speaker
so,
if
dot
says
you're
not
sure,
then
your
client
thinks
they're
not
safe,
the
other
side
thinks
they
are...
their
client
is
safe,
and...
and
therefore,
we
have
a
proceeding
in
a
court
and
work
out
who's
right.
i
mean,
would
that
be
the
answer
to
this?
unknown
speaker
but
is
that...
have
they
taken
into
account
the
very
unusual
situation
where
there
is
such
a
reg,
but
then
the
agency
itself
gets
a
subgroup
of
people
and
says,
we
don't
really
know
whether
it
should
or
should
not
apply
here?
unknown
speaker
i
mean,
i
would
imagine
the
eeoc
reg
is
silent
on
that
point.
unknown
speaker
exactly.
so
then,
don't
we
have
to
have
the
trial
or
the
further
proceeding?
unknown
speaker
ms.--
--well,
unless
unqualified
can
be
determined
as
a
matter
of
law,
this
case
would
have
to
go
back.
in
other
words,
unless
we
could
say,
you're
right.
this
person
is
unqualified
as
a
matter
of
law
because
we
ignore
the
waiver
bit.
we
take
as
mandatory
those
fixed
requirements,
and...
and
we
don't
take
that
position.
and
then
you
can
prevail
as
a
matter
of
summary
judgment.
unknown
speaker
that
wasn't
the
question.
unknown
speaker
whether
we
can
decide
it
as
a
matter
of
law.
the
question
was
if
we
don't...
if
we
don't,
then
it
has
to
go
back.
unknown
speaker
can
i
ask
another
thing
about...
about
the
status
of...
of
this
case?
in...
in
your
questions
presented
in
your
petition,
you...
you
only
ask
whether
a
monocular
individual
is
disabled
per
se.
you
did
not...
you
did
not
include
a
question
about
the
regarded
as
claim.
and
resolving
that
in
your
favor
would
do
you
no
good
since
the...
the
court
of
appeals
also
found
that
this
individual
was
regarded
as
disabled.
now,
i
note
that
in
your
petition,
you...
you
expand
on
question
number
1,
and--
--in
the
brief.
in
the
brief.
i'm
sorry.
in
the
brief,
you
expand
on
question
number
1
so
that
it
includes
not
only
disabled
per
se,
but
also
whether
he's
regarded
as...
as
disabled.
but
it
seems
to
me
that
comes
in
a
bit
late.
unknown
speaker
in
disabled
per
se?
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
what...
what
do
the
words
per
se
mean?
unknown
speaker
what
do
they
add
to
the
sentence
whether
a
monocular
individual
is
disabled
under
the
americans
with
disabilities
act?
unknown
speaker
just
sort
of
thrown
in
there
for
no
reason
at
all.
unknown
speaker
but
doesn't
per
se
mean
disabled,
not
regarded
as
disabled,
but
disabled?
that's...
that's
how
i
took
it.
but
you...
you
say...
but
you...
you
agree
that
it's
no
use
resolving
just
that
first
question
unless
the
second
one
is
also
before
us.
we
have
to
find
in
your
favor
on
both
of
those
questions
to
go
any
further.
unknown
speaker
on...
on
that
issue
i
mean.
of
course,
the...
you
know,
the
qualified
question
would
still
be
here.
unknown
speaker
but
it's...
it's
no
use
deciding
in...
in
your
petition...
to
take
the
questions
in
your
petition,
it's
no
use
deciding
1a
in
your
favor
unless
we're
also
prepared
to
decide
1b
in
your
favor.
right?
well,
i
suppose
you
could
say
every
little
bit
helps.
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
of
the
brief.
the
brief.
i'm
sorry.
unknown
speaker
is...
is
it
right,
if
i...
just
to
understand
it,
the
term
disability
in
the
statute
is
defined
in
terms
of
three
prongs.
so,
you
are
disabled
if
a
or
b
or
c.--
unknown
speaker
--and
so,
what
your
question
raised
is
whether
the
ninth
circuit
is
correct
in
saying
that
your
client...
that
their
client
was
disabled
under
either
a
or
c.--
unknown
speaker
--so,
you
say
you
raised
it
and
weren't
particularly
specific
as
to
which
prong
you
were
pointing
to
in
the
question.
unknown
speaker
did
the
ninth
circuit
use
per
se
in
reference
to
one
prong
but
not
the
other?
unknown
speaker
well,
per
se
is
a
rather...
you
mean
as
a
matter
of
law?
unknown
speaker
why
isn't
the
company
regarding
him
as
disabled?
unknown
speaker
what
was
the
pay
differential
on
the
job
that
they
did...
that
they
did
say
he
could
have?
unknown
speaker
that
was
driver
in
terms
of
the
driver
in
the
yard
as
opposed
to
the
driver
on
the
highway?
unknown
speaker
any
driver?
unknown
speaker
don't
you
think
truck
driver
is
one
category
of...
i
just
don't...
i
just
don't
know
how
to...
how
to
do
the
regarded
as
thing.
you
say
it's...
it's...
he's...
you
think
he
would
have
been
regarded
as
disabled
if
he
could
function
neither
as
a
truck
driver
nor
as
a...
what
is
it...
tire...
tire
mechanic?
unknown
speaker
that--
unknown
speaker
--what's
the
criterion?
the
company
would
have
had
to
not
employ
him?
what
if
the
company
offered
him
a
job
sweeping...
sweeping
the...
the
garage
floors
at
night
after...
after
the
day's
work
is
done?
would
that
be
enough
to
prove
that
they
don't
regard
him
as
disabled?
so
long
as
they
offer
him
some
job,
they're
not
regarding
him
as
disabled?
unknown
speaker
no,
but
the
category
can't
be
as
broad
as
working,
can
it?
unknown
speaker
yes.
i
don't
know
how
to
figure
those
subcategories.
i
honestly
don't.
how
do
we
decide
how
broad
or
narrow?
i
mean,
it's
crucial
to
applying
the
regarded
as
section,
and
how
do
you
decide
how
broad
or
how
narrow
the
category
is?
unknown
speaker
under
the
longshore
and
harbor
workers'
compensation
act,
determinations
are
made
as
to
what
work
is
available
in
the
economy
for
the
particular
individual.
is...
is
that
analysis
suited
to
the
ada?
unknown
speaker
it
doesn't
seem
to
me
to
quite
fit
with
its
language.
unknown
speaker
well,
how
are
we
supposed
to
work
it
out?
i
mean,
should
it...
should
we...
should
we
derive...
this
court
start
deriving
legal
categories?
should
the
eeoc
do
it?
should
juries
do
it?
i
mean,
working
is...
is
too
broad.
truck
driving
in
this
yard
is
too
narrow,
but
who
is
going
to
set
the...
the
median?
unknown
speaker
are
they
doing
it
as
a
matter
of
law
or
are
they...
are
they
doing
it
as
a
matter
of
reviewing
reasonable
jury
discretion?
unknown
speaker
well,
the
eeoc
has,
at
least,
offered
an
interpretive
guideline
i
assume
or
a
regulation
on
the
subject.
unknown
speaker
and
it
says,
the
inability
to
perform
a
single,
particular
job
does
not
constitute
a
substantial
limitation
in
the
major
life
activity
of
working.
but
then
what
do
you
do?
the
plaintiff
says,
well,
i'm
not
talking
about
that.
i'm
talking
about
seeing.
unknown
speaker
but
you
do
say
that
this
was
a
single,
particular
job.
unknown
speaker
and
therefore,
you
don't
get
to
the
is
he
qualified
question,
in
effect.
unknown
speaker
of
course,
all
of
these
cases
involve
a
single,
particular
job.
in...
in
that...
you
know,
in
that
respect,
it's
always
a
particular
job
that
he's
been
turned
down
for.
but
the
question
is,
for
purposes
of
the
regarded
as,
do
we
say
that
single,
particular
job
is
representative
of
all
truck
driving
jobs
or
all...
i
don't
know.
i
really
don't
know
how...
how
to
figure
it
out.
unknown
speaker
and
you'd
say
that's
the
criterion,
so
long
as
that
employer
will
give
him
another
job.
it
doesn't
matter
what
job.
unknown
speaker
wow.
unknown
speaker
is
it...
is
it
the
same
for
every
individual,
or
is...
does
the
individual
at
issue
somehow
determine
how
broad
you
define
the
category?
i
mean,
suppose
a
surgeon
has
spent
his
entire
life
studying
and...
and
learning
to...
to
perform
one
little
operation
and
he
has
a
disability
that
now
makes
it
impossible
for
him
to
perform
that
operation,
or
is
regarded
as
not
being
able
to
perform
that
single
operation--
unknown
speaker
--even
though
he
can
do
a
lot
of
other
surgery.
but
the
man's
whole
career
has
been
based
on
this
thing.
unknown
speaker
the
left
nostril
from...
from
the
time
he
went
to
medical
school.
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
but
you
acknowledge
that
the
regarded
as
decision
requires
you
to
look
at
the
individual,
not...
it's
not
the
same
test
for
everybody.
i
couldn't
say
for
everybody
trucking
is
the
proper
category...
truck
driving
is
the
proper
category.
it
may
be
the
proper
category
for
some.
it
may
not
be
for
others.
is
that...
is
that
right?
unknown
speaker
it's
a
purely
subjective
test.
unknown
speaker
what
do
you
make
of
the
regs
that...
that
speak
of...
of
regarding
in
terms
of
treating,
i.e.,
it
seems
to
be
a
functional
objective
test?
isn't...
isn't
your...
isn't
your
answer
inconsistent
with
the
eeoc's
regs
on
the
subject?
unknown
speaker
it
is
but
you
may
also...
i
mean,
you
may
also
apply
a
treatment
test
as
a
purely
functional
objective
test.
unknown
speaker
yes,
that's
the--
unknown
speaker
--it's...
you
know,
it's
a
bottom
line
kind
of
test
rather
than
an
intent
test.
unknown
speaker
well,
why
mustn't
it
then
go
back
to
the
district
court?
because
it
seems
to
me
somebody
could
extract
or
a
juror
could
find,
based
on
the
statements,
he's
legally
blind.
he's
blind
in
one
eye.
and
somebody
could
say,
what
did
you
mean
by
that?
did
you
mean
you
regarded
him
as
disabled?
the
answer
might
be
yes.
one
can't
say
on
this
record
that
that's
not
so,
that
we...
that
this
is
a
man
who's...
who
is
perceived
as
disabled,
that
in
the
mind
of
the
representative
of
the
employer,
legally
blind,
blind
in
one
eye
equates
to
disabled,
if
it's
a
subjective
test.
unknown
speaker
but
can't
it
explain
why
the
decision
was
made?
the
decision
was
made
because,
of
course,
he's
got
only
one
eye
he
can
see
out
of.
he's
disabled.
unknown
speaker
what
does
it
mean
to
be
legally
blind
in
one
eye?
unknown
speaker
well,
but
who
says
the
person
is
legally
blind?
i
mean,
that...
that
suggests
there's
some
law
been
passed
that
says
people
who
have
less
than
20/100
vision
are...
are
blind.
is
that
so?
unknown
speaker
then
why
do
you
use
the
term
legally...
or
perhaps
why
does
your
employer...
why
does
your
client
use
the
term
legally
blind?
unknown
speaker
well,
what
materials?
unknown
speaker
you
can't--
--well,
but
that's...
that's
a
very
circular
explanation.
it's
a
term
that's
been
used
to
denote
someone
who's
legally
blind.
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
so,
is
it
driving
statutes
or
benefit
statutes?
unknown
speaker
you
wish
to
reserve
your
time,
ms.
gordon?
unknown
speaker
mr.
hunt.
unknown
speaker
let
me
ask
this.
if
you
put
aside
all...
the
waiver
issue
for
just
a
moment,
would
you
not
agree
that
even
though
he
passed
all
those
tests,
if
he
did
not
comply
with
a
federal
standard,
they
would
be
justified
in
terminating
him?
unknown
speaker
yes.
and
then
if
the
waiver
program
is
not
necessarily
binding
on
every...
every
driver
who
doesn't
qualify
because
it
ultimately
was
set
aside,
why
does
the
waiver
program
change
the
situation?
unknown
speaker
so...
so,
it
did.
when
he
went
to
the...
did
your
client
go
to
his
employer?
his
employer
says,
i
don't
want
you
to
work
here
anymore.
and
did
your
client
then
say,
but
i
have
a
waiver?
unknown
speaker
who
had
given
him
the
waiver?
the
employer
or
dot?
unknown
speaker
so,
he
went
to
the
employer.
he
said,
here,
i
have
a
waiver,
and
then
he...
the
employer
said,
i
don't
care,
and
terminated
him.
that's
your
statement
of
the
facts.
unknown
speaker
but
then
did
he
ultimately
get
a
waiver?
unknown
speaker
all
right.
suppose
the
waiver
program
were
in
effect,
and
suppose
albertsons
accepted
him
as
a
driver
under
the
waiver
program.
there's
then
an
accident.
a
little
child
runs
out
the
curb
and
the
allegation
is
his
peripheral
vision
was
such
that
he
didn't
see
the
child
and
he
should
have.
can
albertsons
defend
a
negligence
action
for
negligent
hiring
of
the
monocular
driver
based
on
the
dot
waiver
program?
is
that
an
absolute
defense?
unknown
speaker
well,
this...
would
this
be
a
legitimate
concern
of
the
company,
tort
liability
for
hiring
a
driver
who
may
or
may
not
be
safe,
was
in
a
category
at
least
where
the
dot
was
going
to
experiment
with
him
for
a
while?
unknown
speaker
well,
the
tort
plaintiff
in
the
hypothetical
case
would...
would
allege
that
albertsons
was
guilty
of
negligence
in
hiring
somebody
that
had...
had
less
than
adequate
vision
because
of
the
peripheral
limitation.
unknown
speaker
but
could
the
employer
defend
the
employment
action?
could
the
employer
defend
under
the
ada
by
saying,
i
don't
want
to
have
to
put
this
question
to
the
jury?
unknown
speaker
i
don't...
we
don't
want
to
hire
the
driver
and
take
the
chance
of
having
to
defend
him
in...
in
court.
unknown
speaker
well,
what
if
they've
got
objective
scientific
evidence
that
shows
just
what
justice
kennedy's
hypothetical
assumed,
and
that
is
that,
in
fact,
there
is
a...
a
lack
of
a
certain
percentage
of
peripheral
vision?
is...
is
that
enough?
can
the
company
then
say,
all
right,
our
judgment
is
that
that
risk
posed
by
the...
the
deficient
peripheral
vision,
in
relation
to
the
consequences,
if
someone
driving
one
of
these
huge
trucks
has
an
accident,
justifies
our
imposition
as
a
safety
standard
or
as
a
job
qualification
a...
a
vision
standard
that
would
exclude
this
person?
there's
an
objective
basis,
i.e.,
peripheral
vision.
there's
also
a
judgment
about
what
is
an
acceptable
risk.
is
the
company
free
to
make
that
judgment?
i...
i
don't
mean
absolutely
free,
but
would
that
be
a
reasonable
judgment
for
the
company
to
make
and...
and
permitted
under
the
statute?
unknown
speaker
so,
their...
their
failure
in
your
view
was
simply
that
they...
they
were
too
blunt
about
going
about
what
they...
they
were
doing.
and
if...
if
this
goes
back
for
trial
and
the
company
does
something
along
the
lines
i've
described,
that
would
be
sufficient
to
pass
muster
under
the
statute.
unknown
speaker
you
mean
if...
if
new
objective
evidence
were
discovered
as
a
result
of
independent
scientific
inquiry
between
the
beginning
of
the
action
and
the
time
they
put
in
the
defense,
they
could
not
put
in
the
defense?
unknown
speaker
why
is...
why
is
your
answer
what
it
is?
why
couldn't
they
do
it
if
they...
in
the
case
in
which
they...
they
could
have
known
about
this
evidence,
but
that's
not
what
they
relied
on
at
the
time?
why
are
they
precluded
from
bringing
that
up
as
a
defense?
why?
unknown
speaker
well,
is
there
anything
in
the
statute?
unknown
speaker
mr.
gordon,
you--
unknown
speaker
--hunt.
--would
agree
i
take
it
that
this...
i'm
sorry.
mr.
hunt.
you
agree
that
this
statute
is
not
meant
to
protect
everybody
from
unreasonable
employment
decisions.
it's
only
meant
to
protect
the
disabled.
unknown
speaker
i...
i
worry
about...
about
the...
the
proposition
that
the
regarded
as
provision
can
eat
the
statute,
can
essentially
transform
it
into
a
statute
that
outlaws
all
unreasonable
employment
decisions.
can
you
give
me
an
example
of
a
case
in
which
an
employer
makes
an
unreasonable
qualification
for
the
job
which
is
found
not
to
be
a
justifiable
qualification
for
the
job
on
the
basis
of
some
physical
characteristic,
height,
vision,
whatever,
in
which
that
unreasonable
qualification
would
not
be
the
basis
for
a
regarded
as
disabled
claim?
unknown
speaker
i
am
worried
about
the
fact
that
whenever
an
employer
establishes
a
physical
characteristic
for
the
job,
which
turns
out
to
be
an
unreasonable
one
and
therefore
would
not
qualify
for
the...
for
the
bona
fide
qualification
defense
under
this
statute,
whenever
that's
the
case...
it's
an
unreasonable
qualification...
the
person
turned
down
for
employment
would
be
able
to
say,
you
used
a
physical
characteristic
that
was
not
proper,
and
therefore,
you
were
regarding
me
as
disabled,
and
therefore,
you
are
liable
to
me.
in
other
words,
i'm...
i'm
worried
that
this
is
transforming
the
statute
into
a
statute
that
says
everybody
in
the
country
is
protected
from
unreasonable
employment
decisions
based
on
physical
characteristics.
i
would
like
to
give...
you
to
give
me
a
case
in
which
under
your
theory
of
the...
of
the
regarded
as
clause,
there
is
an
unreasonable
physical
characteristic
qualification
imposed
by
the
employer,
one
that
would
not
satisfy
the
defense
which,
nonetheless,
will
not
qualify
as
the
employer's
regarding
the
individual
as
disabled.
i
can't
explain
it
any
clearer
than
that.
it's
a
very
complex
thought.
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
is
there
any
case
where
that...
where
it
wouldn't
work
out
that
way?
is
there
any
case
where
an
employer
makes,
in
good
faith
perhaps,
a
qualification
for
his
job
that
is
a
physical
characteristic
in
which
the
employee
will
not
be
able
to
say
by
establishing
a
physical
characteristic,
you
have
regarded
me
as
disabled.
and
therefore,
it's
your
burden
to
show
that
this
is
a
necessary
qualification.
well,
how
about
hooters
restaurant
and
it
says,
we
only
hire
women
with
size
40
or
more
bras?
i
mean,
is
that
one
that--
unknown
speaker
--on
regarded
as?
unknown
speaker
well,
the
ted
williams
example
would
be--
--i
would
like
quickly
to
return
to
this
case.
in...
in
this
case,
let's
assume...
everybody
admits
he's
blind
in
one
eye.
some
people
say
legally
blind.
let's
assume
that
in
asking
whether
he's
disabled,
we
find
that
he
is...
is
not
prevented...
substantially
limited
in
a
major
life
activity.
the
regarded
prong
doesn't
take
you
any
further,
does
it?
if
you
make
that
assumption.
but
let's
assume
he's...
he's
not
disabled
under
the
act.
then
in
this
case,
since
everybody
knows
that
he
was
blind
in
the
one
eye,
and
that
that's
what...
the
regarded
prong
doesn't
take
you
any
further,
does
it?
unknown
speaker
but...
but
if...
but
if
he's
not
under...
prevented
from
a...
limited
in
a
substantial
life
activity.
unknown
speaker
then...
then
i
don't
see
how
the
regarded
prong
helps
you.
this
is
in
part
in
answer
to
justice
scalia's
concern.
and
i
think
this
is
a
case
where
that
issue
comes
up,
and...
and
where
you
are
not
helped
by
the
regarded
as
prong.
unknown
speaker
you
tell
me
if
i'm...
i'm
wrong,
please.
unknown
speaker
well,
then,
why
don't
you
qualify
under
the
basic
definition
of
disability?
why
do
you
need
the
regarded
as
prong?
unknown
speaker
is...
is...
can
i
go
for
one
second
to
the
other
part
of
the
case,
which
is
the...
the
question
of
this
test?
will
you
assume,
for
the
sake
of
argument,
that
an
employer,
who
comes
in
and
points
to
a
dot
reg
saying
this
kind
of
person
is
not
safe,
wins
whether
that
reg
is
justified
or
not
justified.
it
can't
be
gone
into
in
a
million
different
cases.
if
you
don't
like
it,
go
to
dot
and
get
it
changed.
assume
that
for
the
sake
of
argument.
unknown
speaker
all
right.
assuming
that,
i
take
it
that
the
argument
that
there
is
no
need
for
a
further
proceeding
on
this
is
there
was
such
a
reg,
and
in
fact,
the
waiver
program
was
an
effort
to
see
if
it
should
be
changed.
so,
the
employer
says,
fine,
if
they
decide
the
answer
to
that
question
is
change
it,
i'll
change
my
position.
if
they
decide
the
answer
to
that
question
is
don't
change
it,
i
was
right
all
the
time.
but
i
don't
have
to
do
anything
as
long
as
the
reg
is
in
place
whether
they
have
an
experimental
program
to
decide
whether
to
change
it
or
not
to
change
it.
now,
what's
your
response
to
that?
unknown
speaker
well,
then
the
experimental
program
becomes...
becomes
a
mandatory
program.
any
employer
who
doesn't
want
to
get
sued
has
to
apply
for
a
waiver.
and
all
of
a
sudden
what
was
meant
to
become
an...
was
meant
to
be
an
experiment
becomes...
becomes
the
standard.
unknown
speaker
i
know,
but
it
was
meant
not
to
apply
to
all
drivers.
it
was
meant
to
be
a
small
segment
of
drivers,
but
you're
telling
me
that
any
employer
with
a
brain
in
his
head
ought
to...
ought
to
apply
to...
to
get
a
waiver.
and
that
means
that
everybody
would...
would
be
in
the
experimental
program.
unknown
speaker
maybe
we
should
have
an
experimental
program
for
people
who
don't
get
waivers.
there
were
very
tight
standards
for
who...
who
can
be
in
the
program.
didn't
they
have
to
have
a
very
good
safety
record
a
certain
number
of
years?
unknown
speaker
so,
a
lot
of
people
who
drive
a
lot
and
get
a
ticket
every
now
and
then
wouldn't
qualify
for
it.
unknown
speaker
mr.
hunt,
before
you
finish,
with
all
that's
unclear
about
this
case,
there's
one
i
think
that
we
could
at
least
focus
on
and
say
it's
wrong
or
right.
it's
the
ninth
circuit's
you
do
it
differently,
so
you're
disabled.
you
do
it
differently
from
a
person
who
has
two
eyes,
even
if
you
do
it
as
well,
if
you
do
it
differently.
are
you
supporting
that
position?
unknown
speaker
thank
you,
mr.
hunt.
mr.
dumont,
we'll
hear
from
you.
would
you
address
the
regarded
as
prong
and
offer
some
views
on
how
in
the
world
we're
supposed
to
view
the
requirements
under
that
and
cabin
it,
if
we
are?
unknown
speaker
wait.
i...
that
doesn't
seem
so
self
evident
to
me.
i
mean,
you
could
say
the
same
thing
about
airlines.
he
sees...
sees
so
badly
that,
you
know,
that
he's
disabled,
but...
i'm
sorry...
doesn't
see
so
badly
that
he's
disabled,
but
does
see
so
badly
that
he
can't
fly
a
plane.
unknown
speaker
why
is
that...
what
is
there
that's
absurd
about
that?
i
don't
understand
it.
unknown
speaker
it
depends
on
how
broad
you
think
the
category
of
disqualification
has
to
be
in
order
to
render
you
substantially
impaired.
i
can
certainly
say,
you
know,
this
person
doesn't
see
badly
enough
to
be
a...
or
this
person's
fingers
aren't
dexterous
enough
to
be...
to
be
disabled
or
he
doesn't
lack
enough
dexterity
to
be
disabled,
but
he...
but
he,
nonetheless,
is
disqualified
from
being
a
brain
surgeon.
there's
nothing
inconsistent
with
that
at
all.
unknown
speaker
it
depends
on
how
broad
the
category
of
the
job
is.
unknown
speaker
are
you...
are
you
saying,
mr.
dumont,
that
as
a
matter
of
law,
a
person
in
mr.
kirkingburg's
position
who
sees
only...
is
disabled?
unknown
speaker
but
that
doesn't
come
to
the
head
of...
that's
the
qualification,
isn't
it?
or
perhaps...
but
certainly
not
the
determination
of
whether
someone
is
disabled.
unknown
speaker
except
there's
a
defense
if
a
government
agency
requires
a
certain
standard,
as
the
dot
did
here
for
vision
for
drivers.
unknown
speaker
you
have
to
get
a
license,
and
there's
a
defense
if
the
person
doesn't
have
that
license.
isn't
that
right?
unknown
speaker
but
this
statute...
this
statute
wasn't
meant
to
apply
to
all
americans.
it
was
meant
to
allow
lawsuits
only
by
a
discrete
and
insular
category
of
people.
and
to
simply
say
letting
everybody
in
the
door
is
no
problem
because
they're
going
to
have
to
face
these
later
hurdles,
i
mean,
it
may
make
sense,
but
it's
not
the
way
the
act
was
written.
could
you
answer
the
question
that
i
asked
before
to
mr.
hunt?
give
me
an
example
of
a
physical
qualification
for
a
particular
job
that
is
unreasonable
which
would
not...
which
would,
nonetheless,
not
allow
the
person
who
is
denied
the
job
on
that
basis
to
claim
that,
under
your
theory,
he
was
regarded
as
disabled?
unknown
speaker
okay.
good.
unknown
speaker
blue
eyes.
unknown
speaker
blue
eyes.
but
i
say
people...
i
don't
think
people
with
blue
eyes
can
drive
trucks.
okay?
unknown
speaker
and,
therefore,
it's
a...
it's
a
job
qualification
and--
unknown
speaker
--but
you
say
under
your
theory,
i
would
not
be
regarding
you
as
disabled
because
you
have
blue
eyes.
unknown
speaker
well,
wait,
wait.
why
isn't
it
an
impairment?
if...
if
the
substantial
life
activity
is
driving
trucks,
i
suppose
it
would
be
an
impairment.
unknown
speaker
an
occasional
headache.
unknown
speaker
--is
right.
unknown
speaker
be
a
little
more
realistic.
what
about
a
person
who
gets
occasional
headaches?
and
he
occasionally
gets
a
headache,
and
the
employer
says,
i
don't
want
people
who
get
any
headaches.
we're...
we're
fit
and
healthy
in
this
firm.
he's
a
health
nut
of
some
sort--
[laughter]
--and
doesn't
want
anybody
with
occasional
headaches.
i'd
say
that's
somewhat
irrational.
does
he
fit
within
the
statute
in
your
opinion?
unknown
speaker
here's
the
example.
by
the
way,
is
there
a
need
to
get
into
any
of
this
here?
i
don't
understand.
it
seemed
as
if
at
the
beginning
this...
whether
it's
like
an
occasional
headache
or
whether
it's
like
some
other
more
serious
matter
was
a
matter
for
trial
or
for
further
proceedings.
i've
never
heard
of
giving
summary
judgment
or
granting
it
when
it
wasn't
asked
for,
and
i
guess
it
wasn't.
so,
are
we
just
debating
this
theoretically?
unknown
speaker
you
say
a
little
too
broadly.
i
mean,
ruled
as
a
matter
of
law
different
manner
equals
disabled.
unknown
speaker
suppose
we
say
that
under
section
(a)
of
the
statute
there
is
no
substantial
limitation
on
the
life...
life
activity.
you
lose...
the
employee
loses
under
section
(a).
is
the
regarded...
does
the
regarded
section
in
section
(c)
help
at
all?
unknown
speaker
that...
that
has
to
help.
i
mean,
to
say...
to
say
that
the
regarded
as
qualified
doesn't
help
once
you're
determined...
regarded
as
disabled
doesn't
help
once
you've
been
determined
not
actually
to
be
disabled
is
to
say
that
it
has
no
function
at
all.
it's
whole
function
is
to
cover
those
cases
where
the
individual
is
not
in
fact
disabled,
but
is
regarded
as
disabled.
so,
it
has
to
be
somebody
who
does
not
really
genuinely
qualify
and,
therefore,
perhaps
is
not
one
of
the...
the
median
group
that
you
say.
i
think
that's
a
criticism
rather
than
a
question,
mr.
dumont.
i
think
it
is.
[laughter]
thank
you,
mr.
dumont.
unknown
speaker
ms.
gordon,
you
have
2
minutes
remaining.
unknown
speaker
but
how
can
you
reconcile
that
with
the
decision
to
allow
all
existing
waivers
to
remain
in
effect?
unknown
speaker
oh,
okay.
unknown
speaker
close
enough
for
government
work.
i
think
that's--
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
the
honorable
court
is
now
adjourned
until
monday
next
at
ten
o'clock.
