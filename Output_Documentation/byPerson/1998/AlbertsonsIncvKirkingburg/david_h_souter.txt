justice
david
h.
souter
this
is
also
a
case
on
the
americans
with
disabilities
act.
it
comes
to
us
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit.
the
respondent,
hallie
kirkingburg
has
a
condition
known
as
amblyopia,
it
leaves
him
with
20/200
vision
in
his
left
eye
and
that's
effectively
leaves
him
with
monocular
vision.
before
beginning
a
truck
driver's
job
with
the
petitioner
albertsons,
kirkingburg
was
erroneously
certified
as
meeting
the
department
of
transportation's
basic
vision
standards
for
commercial
truck
drivers.
those
standards
require
corrected
distant
visual
acuity
of
at
least
20/40
in
each
eye
and
distant
binocular
acuity
of
at
least
20/40.
when
his
vision
was
later
correctly
accessed,
albertsons
fired
him
and
although
kirkingburg
obtained
a
waiver
of
the
vision
requirement
under
an
experimental
dot
program,
albertsons
refused
to
rehire
him.
kirkingburg
brought
this
suit
asserting
that
albertsons
had
violated
the
ada.
the
district
court
granted
summary
judgment
to
albertsons
but
the
ninth
circuit
reversed
concluding
that
kirkingburg
had
established
that
he
was
disabled
under
the
ada
by
demonstrating
a
significant
difference
in
the
manner
in
which
he
sees.
the
circuit
court
also
held
that
although
the
ada
generally
allows
employers
to
rely
on
government
regulations
in
setting
job
related
qualification
standards,
the
department
of
transportations'
waiver
program
precluded
albertsons
from
doing
so
in
this
case.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
of
court
today,
we
reverse
first
on
the
disability
determination.
the
ada
requires
monocular
individuals
like
others
claiming
the
act's
protection
to
offer
evidence
showing
that
their
impairment
caused
a
substantial
limitation
on
a
major
life
activity,
in
this
case
the
activity
of
seeing.
the
ninth
circuit,
however,
concluded
that
nearly
a
significant
difference
between
the
manner
in
which
kirkingburg
sees
and
the
manner
in
which
most
people
sees
sufficed.
the
court
also
suggested
that
it
need
not
take
account
of
an
individual's
ability
to
compensate
for
an
impairment.
but
we
hold
today
in
the
cases
to
be
announced
in
a
few
moments,
that
mitigating
measures
must
be
taken
into
account
in
judging
whether
an
individual
has
a
disability.
and
the
ninth
circuit
finally
did
not
pay
much
heed
to
the
statutory
obligation
to
determine
a
disability's
existence
on
a
case-by-case
basis.
some
impairments
may
invariably
cause
a
substantial
limitation
on
a
major
life
activity,
but
as
we
understand
it,
that
a
monocularity
does
not.
with
respect
to
albertsons'
insistence
that
kirkingburg
need
the
dot
basic
visual
acuity
standards,
which
would
ordinarily
be
binding
on
albertsons,
the
question
we
must
answer
is
what
effect
if
any
of
the
dots
waiver
program
had?
the
ninth
circuit
concluded
that
the
waiver
program
had
in
effect
modified
the
general
visual
acuity
standards
creating
a
different
safety
standard
made
applicable
by
granting
a
waiver,
which
an
employer
was
not
free
to
disregard.
by
its
own
terms,
however,
the
waiver
program
was
simply
an
experiment
proposed
by
the
angecy
as
it
means
for
obtaining
data
in
order
to
consider
relaxing
the
general
visual
acuity
standards.
those
standards
remain
unchanged
at
the
time
albertsons
made
its
employment
decision
and
the
regulatory
record
made
clear
that
the
waiver
program
did
not
stand
on
the
same
substantive
ground
as
the
basic
standards.
the
ada
does
not
require
an
employer
to
defend
its
decision
not
to
participate
in
such
an
experiment,
it
is
simply
not
credible
with
congress
enacted
the
ada
with
the
understanding
that
employers
choosing
to
respect
the
government's
sole
visual
acuity
regulation
in
the
face
of
an
experimental
waiver
might
be
burden
for
the
obligation
to
defend
the
regulations
application
according
to
its
own
terms.
we
therefore
hold
that
an
employer
who
requires
as
a
job
qualification,
that
an
employee
need
an
otherwise
applicable
federal
safety
regulation
is
not
required
by
the
ada
to
justify
enforcing
the
regulation
solely
because
it
may
be
waived
experimentally
in
an
individual
case.
justice
stevens
and
justice
breyer
have
joined
only
parts
one
and
three
of
this
opinion
and
justice
thomas
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion.
