mr.
scott
n.
hunt
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
hallie
kirkingburg
can
drive
a
commercial
motor
vehicle
safely
in
interstate
commerce.
he
did
it
for
11
years
before
he
was
hired
by
albertsons.
when
albertsons
tested
him
at
the
time
of
hiring,
they
gave
him
an
18-mile
road
test
and
certified
he
could
drive
safely.
during
the
16
months
that
mr.
kirkingburg
drove
for
albertsons,
his
supervisors
judged
him
to
be
a
good,
safe
driver.
it
was
only
after
mr.
kirkingburg's
vision
condition
became
known
to
albertsons,
through
his
need
for
a
vision
waiver,
that
albertsons
asserted
he
posed
a
safety
risk.
mr.
kirkingburg
is
able
to
drive
safely
despite
his
amblyopia
and
strabismus,
his
outward--
mr.
scott
n.
hunt
--putting
aside
the
waiver
program,
yes.
mr.
scott
n.
hunt
well,
to
begin
with,
it
wasn't
ultimately
set
aside.
the
advocates
court
did
set
it
aside...
find
it
to
be
invalid,
but
it
was
then,
when
remanded
to
the
agency,
reinserted
in
that
all
the
waivers
were
grandfathered
in.
they
were
revalidated.
and
in
fact,
since
then
the
program
has
continued
and
waivers
have
continued
to
be
granted.
in
fact,
the
eighth
circuit
in
rauenhorst
required
the
agency
to
consider
granting
that
plaintiff
an
individual
waiver
despite
the
fact
that
the
program's
cutoff
time
for
application
had
expired.
mr.
scott
n.
hunt
the
way
it
occurred
was
when
he
came
back
from
an
extended
period
of
time
off,
he
did
not
pass
the
dot
certification
exam,
was
informed
by
the
examining
doctor
that
he
needed
to
obtain
a
waiver.
he
then
went
to
the
employer
to
obtain
that
waiver
a
day
or
2
later.
the
employer
refused
to
accept
the
waiver,
and
2
weeks
later
terminated
him.
mr.
scott
n.
hunt
dot,
through
the
federal
highway
administration.
mr.
scott
n.
hunt
no.
he
went
to
the
employer
and
said,
i
need
a
waiver,
and
the
employer
said,
we
will
not
accept
a
waiver.
you
must
meet
the
minimum
standards,
and
terminated
him.
mr.
scott
n.
hunt
yes,
he
did.
mr.
scott
n.
hunt
i'm
not...
i'm
not
certain
that
it
would
be
an
absolute
defense.
it
certainly
would
be
a
defense
they
could
present.
and
yes,
i
believe
it
should
be
a
defense.
mr.
scott
n.
hunt
well,
i
don't
think
the
may
or
may
not
be
safe
is
sufficient.
under
the
regulations,
it
needs
to
be
a
significant
risk.
it
needs
to
be
an
immediate
risk.
mr.
scott
n.
hunt
and...
and
i
think
the
employer
could
defend
on
the
grounds
that
the...
the
agency
in
charge
of
determining
safety
standards
had
determined
that
the
individual
who
received
the
waiver,
through
an
individual
assessment,
was
safe
to
drive.
mr.
scott
n.
hunt
no.
mr.
scott
n.
hunt
i
believe
that
that
needs
to
be...
when
they
are
asserting
that
sort
of
safety
threat
defense
under
the
ada,
under
the
statutory
language,
they
must...
and
under
the
terms...
this
court's
ruling
last
term,
they
need
to
rely
on
objective
evidence,
objective
scientific
evidence
to
justify
that
safety
risk.
mr.
scott
n.
hunt
i
believe
in
that
case
it
would...
they
would
meet
the
necessity
of
supplying
objective
evidence
to
justify
their
direct
threat
defense.
that's
not
what
happened
in
this
case.
there's
no
evidence
in
this
case
that
they
justified
it
by
anything
other
than
safety
concerns,
generalized
safety
concerns.
mr.
scott
n.
hunt
well,
i
think
the
company
would
have
to
provide
evidence
that
they
had
considered
that
objective
evidence
that
your
honor
refers
to
at
the
time
that
it
refused
to
accept
the
waiver.
it
would
not
be
sufficient
to
after
the
fact
say,
well,
now
that
we're
in
litigation,
we've
examined
these
various
studies,
and
we
have
found
four
out
of
the
dozen
or
so
that
we've
looked
at,
and
those
support
our
position
that
we
took
several
years
ago.
mr.
scott
n.
hunt
if...
if
new...
if
it's
additional
information,
i
believe
they
could.
if
the
record
is
that,
as
it
appears
to
be
in
this
case,
that
there
was
no
consideration
of
objective
scientific
evidence,
then
i
don't
think
they
could
now
find
after
the
fact,
oh,
there
is
scientific
evidence.
if
they
did
have
objective
evidence
that
they
relied
upon
at
the
time
of
refusing
the
waiver,
then
i
believe
your...
your
hypothetical
would
be
appropriate
and
they
could
add
it.
mr.
scott
n.
hunt
i
believe
it
would
come
under
the...
the
sense
of
after
acquired
evidence,
that
sort
of
analogy,
that
you
can't
rely
upon--
mr.
scott
n.
hunt
--i
can't
think
of
anything
in
the
statute
that
would
prevent
them
from
adding
that
evidence.
mr.
scott
n.
hunt
it's
mr.--
mr.
scott
n.
hunt
--correct.
mr.
scott
n.
hunt
to
be
honest
with
you,
i
have
trouble
following
all
the
details
of
that
question...
of
that
hypothetical.
mr.
scott
n.
hunt
i...
i
believe
this
case
presents
that...
that
situation
where
they
regard
him
as
legally
blind
even
though
he's
not
legally
blind.
it's
not
appropriate...
it's
not
reasonable
for
them
to
make
that
assumption.
mr.
scott
n.
hunt
i...
i--
mr.
scott
n.
hunt
--i
think
the...
i
think
the...
excuse
me,
your
honor.
the...
i'm
having
trouble
thinking
of
an
example--
mr.
scott
n.
hunt
--i
believe
it
does
because
in
addition
to
the
blind
in
one
eye
perception,
there
is
the
legally
blind
perception.
and
the
legally
blind
perception,
under
rehabilitation
act
precedent,
would
be
substantially
limiting.
in
other
words--
mr.
scott
n.
hunt
--he
would
still
have
to
be.
i
mean,
rather,
he'd
have
to
be--
mr.
scott
n.
hunt
--well,
i
think--
mr.
scott
n.
hunt
--well,
i
think
legally
blind,
although
there
is
a
question
as
to
what
exactly
legally
blind
means,
but
i
think
the
perception
of
someone
being
legally
blind
and
then
treating
that
person
by...
by
eliminating
their
employment,
by
terminating
them
completely
from
employment
is
a
substantial
limitation.
they...
they
still
have
to...
the
way
they
treat
them
has
to
be
substantially
limiting.
the
way
they
perceive
them...
the
impairment
to
impact
them
has
to
be
substantially
limiting.
mr.
scott
n.
hunt
there's...
there's
a
potential
difference
in
monocular
vision
versus
legally
blind.
monocular
vision
is
the
one
eye
issue.
the
statement
that
the
ninth
circuit
relied
upon
that
we
offer
as
evidence
that
he's
perceived
to
be
disabled
includes
a
reference
to
legally
blind
which
is
not
reference
to
one
eye.
so...
so,
if
the
court
were
to
find
that
monocular
vision
is
not
an
actual
disability,
the
regarded
as
would
still
provide
a
means
to
find
that
he
was
disabled.
mr.
scott
n.
hunt
yes.
mr.
scott
n.
hunt
first
of
all,
it's
not
an
experimental...
the
waiver
program
is
not
experimental
as
to
the
safety
of
the
individuals
who
are
assessed
by
the
federal
highway
administration
and
granted
a
vision
waiver.
it's
experimental
only
in
that
it
is
hoping
to
gather
statistical
evidence
from
which
it
can
then
adjust
the
standard
minimum
requirements.
so,
there's
no...
there's
no...
the
basis
for
the...
albertsons
to
say,
well,
we
can
rely
on
these
basic
minimum
requirements
when
the
agency
itself
has
said,
no,
to
comply
with
the
ada,
as
we've
been
instructed
to
do
by
congress,
we
have
determined
that
this
set
of
individuals
who
meet
these
specific
criteria
are
safe
to
drive,
that
in
that
situation,
the
employer
cannot
simply
rely
on
the
standard
minimum
requirements
as
its
justification
for
a
safety
concern.
mr.
scott
n.
hunt
again,
it
was
not
meant
to
be
an
experiment
as
to
the...
allowing
those
particular
drivers
to
drive.
mr.
scott
n.
hunt
no,
and--
mr.
scott
n.
hunt
--indeed,
the
standards,
justice
ginsburg,
to
get
into
the
program
were
stricter
than
it
was
to
drive
in
general.
mr.
scott
n.
hunt
there
was
a
requirement
of
3
years
of
safe
driving
with
no
suspensions,
no
revocations,
no
disqualifying
traffic
violations.
so,
the
people...
it's
not
for
anybody
who
can
receive
a
waiver.
it's
only
for
people
that
established
that
they're
safe
drivers
through
an
individual
assessment
conducted
by
the
federal
highway
administration.
mr.
scott
n.
hunt
i
think
the...
i
think
that
statement
by
the
ninth
circuit
needs
to
be
read
in
context
of
the
entire
paragraph.
the
ninth
circuit
finds
that
mr.
kirkingburg's
sight,
his
seeing
is
restricted
due
to
the
loss
of
peripheral
vision
and
due
to
the
change
and
impact
on
depth
perception.
if
you
read...
and
then
it
cites
to
the
eeoc
regulations
regarding
how...
regarding
substantial
limitation
and
the
fact
that
it's
a
difference
in
manner,
condition,
or
duration.
and
if
you...
if
you
combine
all
of
that
in
context,
the
seeing
differently
statement
is
too
broad,
but
in
context
i
believe
means
that
you
still
have
to
be
substantially
limited
in
the...
in
a
major
life
activity,
as
the
court
found.
thank
you.
