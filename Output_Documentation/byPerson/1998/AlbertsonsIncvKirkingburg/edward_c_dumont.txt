mr.
edward
c.
dumont
well,
i
would
say
that
with
respect
to
this
case,
your
honor,
the
best
way
out
of
that
problem
for
this
case
is
to
say
that
what
happened
here
was
that
the
employer
clearly
viewed
respondent
as
substantially
limited
in
the
life
activity
of
seeing.
the
anomaly
that
is
presented
here
is
what
they
want
to
say
is
that
this
is
a
person
who
can
see
so
well
that
he's
not
even
disabled
within
the
cognizance
of
the
ada,
but
so
poorly
that
he
can't
drive
a
truck.
and
that,
with
respect
to
the
substantial
life
activity
of
seeing
is,
we
think,
a
fundamentally
logically
inconsistent
position.
now,
when
you
get
into
working--
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
--well,
and
i
think--
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
--i
think
within
some
limits
imposed
by
the
word
substantially,
that's
the
right
analysis;
that
if
a
company
is
going
to
take
an
employment
action
based
on...
based
on...
admittedly
based
on
a
physical
limitation
that
goes
to
one
of
your
major
life
activities...
in
this
case
it's
seeing...
then
they
are
in
a
poor
position
to
turn
around
and
say
that,
nonetheless,
your
vision
is
so
good
that
you
are
not
even
substantially
limited
enough
to
be
within
the
coverage
of
the
act.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
i
think
you're--
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
--with
respect,
i
think
you're
focusing
on
jobs,
and
that's
the
wrong
focus
here.
what
i'm
suggesting
is
that
if
you
focus
on
the
life
activity
which
here
is
seeing,
not
working,
then
i
agree
with
you
that
the
statute
requires
us
to
say
is
there
a
substantial
limitation
on
seeing.
but
both
with
respect
to
somebody
who
has
20/200
vision
without
her
glasses
and
with
respect
to
somebody
who,
because
of
a
physical
difference
in
the
way
his
eye
is
constructed,
in
effect
sees
only
out
of
one
eye,
we
think
that
it's
fairly
clear
that
those
people
are...
are
substantially
limited
with
respect
to
seeing.
and
not
only
that,
but
if
an
employer
adopts
an
employment
standard
which
is
based
on
precisely
that
physical
characteristic,
the
inability
to
see
better
than
this,
what
they
are
doing
is
to
treat
that
person
as
substantially
limited
in
his
seeing.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
not
as
a
matter
of
law
that
he's
disabled.
i
would
say
that
it
comes
close
to
being
that
when
you
have
an
employer
who
has
a
qualification
standard
that
is
based
on
a...
a
minimum
vision
requirement
and
takes
action
against
an
individual--
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
--i
think
the
two
are
very
closely
related,
and
let
me
address
that
point
this
way.
under
the
act,
under
the
definition
of
discrimination
in
the
act,
it
is
discrimination
to
use
a
qualification
test
that
has
a
disparate
impact
on
a
person
with
a
disability,
which
in
this
case
is
certainly
true
about
mr.
kirkingburg
if
you
believe
that
his
limitation
comes
within
the
definition
of
disability.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
there's
that
defense--
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
--absolutely.
there
is
that
defense
and
there
is
also
the
defense
that,
although
you
are
in
fact
taking
action
on
this
characteristic,
it's
legitimately
related
to
the
job,
it's...
it's
necessary
for
safety.
and
you
can
win
that
way.
my
point
is
that
there
is
no
reason
to...
and
in
fact,
a
good
reason
not
to...
interpret
the
definition
of
disability
so
narrowly
that
in
these
cases
you
stop
the
person
from
getting
in
the
door
to
the
court.
because
what
you're
going
to
do
when
you're
through
that
door
is
have
exactly
the
kind
of
a
debate
you
ought
to
be
having
which
is
this
requirement--
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
--yes,
absolutely.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
blue
eyes.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
blue
eyes,
which
is
not
an
impairment.
i
think
actually
the
example
of
the
quarterback
who's
a
little
too
short--
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
--right,
which--
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
--that's
right.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
because
it's
not
an
impairment
which
the
statute
requires.
here's
another
example
of
something
that
is
an
impairment.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
no,
because
we
look
to
the
language
of
the
statute
and
some
language...
some
language
is
open
to
interpretation
and,
in
fact,
requires
interpretation
like
substantially
limit.
some
language
is
pretty
precise
like
impairment.
and
impairment
implies
some
deviation
from
the
norm,
and
i
think
it
would
be
improper
to
call
having
blue
eyes
an
impairment.
here's
another
example.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
here's
another
example.
suppose
there's
somebody
who's
missing
the
third
toe
from
the
left
on
his
left
foot,
and
in
fact
you
can
demonstrate...
now,
i
don't
know
whether
this
is
true,
but
in
fact
you
can
demonstrate
that
it
has
absolutely
no
effect
on
his
ability
to
do
anything.
now,
that
person
is
impaired.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
that
person
is
impaired,
but
it
would
be
unreasonable
i
think
for
any
employer
to
base
a
job
qualification
on
that--
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
--i
think
it's
a...
probably
not
because
you
have--
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
--i
think
we
are
and
i
think
that's
all
we
want
is
to
go...
all
the
respondent
wants
is
to
go
back
for
trial
here.
now,
i
do
think
you
can
say
that
the
ninth
circuit
may
have
spoken
a
little
too
broadly,
exactly
as
my
colleague
said.
but
i...
i
would
actually
not
agree--
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
--if
it's
different
manner
equals,
but
i
wouldn't
say
it's
entirely
the
wrong
inquiry.
i
mean,
i
think
the
regulatory
inquiry...
and
that's
where
that
comes
from
is
the
eeoc's
regulations...
the
inquiry
is
perfectly
valid.
to
say
that
because
a
person
who's
right
handed
performs
the
same
task
as
someone
who's
left
handed
in
a
different
manner,
that
makes
him
disabled,
i
think
that
is...
that
might
be
within
the
ninth
circuit's
definition
broadly
read.
that
would
be
improper.
but
i
think
it
is
true
to
say
that
simply
because
somebody
has
what
anyone
would
recognize
as
an
impairment...
i
mean,
suppose
you
started
off
with
a...
well,
many
people
who
lose
an
eye
midway
through
life,
for
instance,
will
go
through
a
transition
period
where
they
have
very
poor
depth
perception,
very
poor
vision
in
the
very
beginning
because
they're
adjusting,
and
then
they'll
get
better
and
better
as
time
goes
by.
now,
i
think
it...
it
would
be
wrong
to
pretermit
the
inquiry
into
the
fact
that
when
they
get
to
the
end,
they
may
see
pretty
much
functionally
the
same
way
for
some...
for
many
purposes.
but
it's
wrong
to
pretermit
an
inquiry
into
whether
the
fact
that
they
have
to
do
it
through
a
different
purpose...
through
a
different
manner
is...
is
substantially
limiting.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
i
certainly
think
it
is
helpful
to
the
extent
that...
i
would
say
as
i
said
before.
if...
if
the
employer
is
in
fact
taking
job
related
action
based
on
its
perception
of
the
fact
that
you
need
to
have
a
certain
kind
of
vision
or
certain
other
kind
of
physical
qualification
to
meet
a
safety
standard,
then
it's
precisely
the
right
inquiry
whether
that's
true
or
not,
whether
you
really
need
that
qualification,
that
physical
qualification,
or
not
to
do
this
job.
but
that
is
an
inquiry
that
you
get
to
when
you
get
into
the
guts
of
the
statute
under--
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
--thank
you,
your
honor.
