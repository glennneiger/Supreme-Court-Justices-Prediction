mr.
eric
w.
bloom
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i'd
like
to
turn
immediately
to
a
couple
of
issues
raised
in
the
questioning
of
the
appellant.
justice
ginsburg,
you
asked
the
question:
how
did
these
instructions
come
to
be?
and
i
think
it's
very
important
to
go
through
the
procedural
posture.
in
this
case,
sun-diamond
filed
a
motion
to
dismiss
the
indictment.
the
government
opposed
that
motion
and,
in
very
explicit
terms,
said
that
courts
have
made
clear
that
for
a
gratuity
to
be
established,
it
is
not
necessary
to
allege
a
direct
nexus
between
the
value
conferred
and
an
official
act
by
the
public
official.
that's
page
5
in
the
government's
opposition.
indeed,
after--
mr.
eric
w.
bloom
--yes.
that
was--
mr.
eric
w.
bloom
--i'm
sorry?
mr.
eric
w.
bloom
yes,
your
honor,
we
do.
mr.
eric
w.
bloom
i
understand
that.
and
i
literally
want
to
walk
you
through
it.
because
the
next
step
was--
mr.
eric
w.
bloom
--i
understand.
i
walk
very
quickly.
[laughter]
then
we
go
to
trial.
and
at
trial,
in
opening
statements,
the
independent
counsel...
when
i
refer
to
the
independent
counsel,
i
mean
the
office
of
independent
counsel...
told
the
jury,
quote,
what
this
is
and
what
the
law
prohibits
is
giving
a
thing
of
value
to
a
public
official
because
the
person
is
a
public
official,
when
there's
some
business
that
you
have
before
the
public
official.
that's
pages
3
and
4
of
the
transcript.
then,
at
a
sidebar,
the
independent
counsel
reaffirmed
this
view.
mr.
eric
w.
bloom
i'm
sorry...
after
4
years...
the
united
states.
the
prosecutor
then
reaffirmed
this
view
to
the
court,
and
said,
essentially,
the
court
did
not
require
the
showing
of
a
nexus
between
the
thing
of
value
and
the
particular
acts
the
secretary
may
have
taken.
it
is
not
necessary
under
the
law.
and
that's
page
734
of
the
transcript.
this
case
was
being
tried
under
the
"for
or
because
of
an
official
position.
"
standard.
so,
when
the
parties
filed
our
respective
proposed
jury
instructions,
it
is
not
surprising
that
the
jury
instructions
do
not
come
close
to
one
another.
with
respect
to
the
jury
instructions
themselves,
we
believe
that,
effectively,
it
stripped
the
factfinder
of
finding
the
one
question...
essential
question...
in
this
case.
specifically,
whether
in
fact
sun-diamond's
gifts
were
for
or
because
of
any
official
act.
now,
as
i
understand
mr.
ray--
mr.
eric
w.
bloom
--ultimately,
that's
not
sun-diamond's
battle,
but
we
do
believe
that...
that
the
statute
calls
for
a
link
between
a
gift
on
one
hand
and
some
specific
or
identifiable
official
act.
mr.
eric
w.
bloom
well--
mr.
eric
w.
bloom
--well,
two
answers--
mr.
eric
w.
bloom
--two
answers--
mr.
eric
w.
bloom
--i
strongly
suspect
that
if
i
had
matters
before
the
fcc
or
before
any
department,
it's
not
going
to
be
terribly
difficult
for
the
prosecutor,
especially
with
the
resources
of
the
grand
jury,
to
be
able
to
identify
matters.
the
second
point--
mr.
eric
w.
bloom
--well,
i
strongly
suspect
that
a
jury
could
find
that
it
was
for
an
act,
if
one
were
identified.
but
using
your
hypothetical--
mr.
eric
w.
bloom
--i
understand,
sir.
using
your
hypothetical,
i
would
suspect
that
that
person
could
be
charged
under
one
of
the
other
statutes...
the
salary
supplementation
statute.
it
sounds
like
he's
giving
the
money
because
of
the
job
and
because
of
his
acts
as...
pursuant--
mr.
eric
w.
bloom
--right.
and
our
answer
is
no.
mr.
eric
w.
bloom
is
no.
mr.
eric
w.
bloom
under
bribery,
you
need
a
quid
pro
quo,
there's
clearly
strings
attached.
mr.
eric
w.
bloom
right,
i
understand.
mr.
eric
w.
bloom
right.
mr.
eric
w.
bloom
let
us
hypothesize
that
i'm
giving
a
lot
of
gifts,
not
in
exchange
for,
not
with
any
implicit
or
explicit
agreement
that
the
government
official
is
going
to
do
me
a
favor
in
return.
there
are
no
strings
attached.
i'm
plying
this
guy
with
gifts,
hoping
that
it
may
influence
him.
hoping
that
when
the
time
comes,
that
he's
going
to
rule
on
mpp
or
methyl
bromide,
that
he's
going
to
think
twice
about
me.
mr.
eric
w.
bloom
no.
our
view
is
that
the
prosecutor
has
to
identify
one
or
more
acts
for
which
the
gifts
are
given.
mr.
eric
w.
bloom
under
the
bribery
statute,
there's
a
quid
pro
quo.
mr.
eric
w.
bloom
that
is
correct.
mr.
eric
w.
bloom
there
is
no
agreement.
mr.
eric
w.
bloom
right.
essentially,
there
is
no
agreement
in
the
case
of
a
gratuity.
the...
the
typical
or
classical
or
traditional
gratuity
is
the
reward.
a
reward
for
not
taking...
or
one
where
the
government
official
has
committed
themselves
to
performing
that
act.
mr.
eric
w.
bloom
well,
not
even
articulation.
there
is
no
agreement.
mr.
eric
w.
bloom
because
we
believe
that
the
statute
almost
cries
out
for
it.
the
words
of
the
statute--
mr.
eric
w.
bloom
--in
the
appendix,
the
court
of
appeals
decision
is
attached
and...
at
page
8...
and
whatever
degree
of
intent
to
influence
may
be
necessary
for
a
bribe.
a
gift
looking
to
future
acts
can
be
an
unlawful
gratuity,
where
the
giver
is
motivated
simply
by
the
desire
to
increase
the
likelihood
of
one
or
more
specific
favorable
acts.
mr.
eric
w.
bloom
no,
we
say
that's
correct.
mr.
eric
w.
bloom
well--
mr.
eric
w.
bloom
--no.
you
are
absolutely,
perfectly
correct.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
what
you
articulated
is
very
recently
what
the
fourth
circuit
adopted
in
united
states
v.
jennings.
and
perhaps
it's
best
to
kind
of
set
up
a
hierarchy
of
conduct.
clearly,
the
top
tier
would
be
bribery.
and
there
you
have
a
quid
pro
quo,
this
for
that,
there
are
strings
attached.
there
is
a
tier...
gratuities...
clearly
covering...
and
i
believe
what
congress,
in
the
legislative
history,
suggested
it
was
intending
to
cover...
were
rewards,
a
tip,
a
thank
you.
the
question
is
whether
a
gratuity
can
also
cover
instances
with
respect
to
influence.
and
i
kind
of
like
the
court
of
appeals--
mr.
eric
w.
bloom
--well,
what
the
courts
have
done
that
interpret
the
gratuity
statute
as
merely
a
reward...
in
fact,
there
was
an
eighth
circuit
case
that
affirmed
an
instruction.
and
the
instruction
said
this:
find
the
defendant
guilty
if
you
find
that
the
gift
was
intended
as
a
reward
for
any
acts
the
government
official
committed
or
committed
to
perform.
mr.
eric
w.
bloom
no,
because--
mr.
eric
w.
bloom
--well,
let
me
give
you
the
hypothetical.
what
about
a--
mr.
eric
w.
bloom
--let
me
give
you
an
example
of
what
it
is
i'm
talking
about,
mr.
chief
justice.
[laughter]
and
that
is,
i,
as
a
senator,
make
out
a
very
public
statement:
i
am
going
to
vote
for
this
piece
of
legislation.
i
am
committed
to
performing
it.
i
haven't
acted
on
it
yet.
in
fact,
that
legislation
may
not
even
be
pending.
i'm
thrilled
that
he's
taking
this
stance.
it
is
an
act
to
be
performed.
i
give
him
the
reward.
mr.
eric
w.
bloom
and
certainly
it's
a
legitimate
question--
mr.
eric
w.
bloom
--whether
or
not--
mr.
eric
w.
bloom
--that...
that's
exactly
right.
and
one
of
the
things
that
we
try
to
grapple
with
is--
mr.
eric
w.
bloom
--well,
we
believe
that
the
statute
does
call
for
that,
that's
right.
and
one
of
the
questions
here
that
i
think
it's
a
difficult--
mr.
eric
w.
bloom
--and,
ironically,
we
actually
agree
with
this.
it's
still
a
multitude
of
specific
acts.
you
can
tell
us
what
those...
what
the
group
of
specific
acts
are.
mr.
eric
w.
bloom
well,
i
think
the
answer
is
probably
yes.
and
i
think
that
the
answer
to
why
it's
probably
yes--
mr.
eric
w.
bloom
--well,
i
was
going
to
just
say,
provided
the
government
can
identify
the
myriad
of
specific
acts.
in
other
words,
clearly,
if
i've
got
10
matters
pending,
and
i
could
literally
give
all
that
money--
mr.
eric
w.
bloom
--what
we're
trying
to--
mr.
eric
w.
bloom
--what
we're
trying
to
protect
against
is
a
jury
just
saying,
wait
a
minute,
these
guys
gave
money;
it
must
have
been
to
influence.
influence
what?
the
act
requires
a
gift
on
the
one
hand,
act
or
acts
on
the
other
hand,
and
some
nexus
for
or
because
of
an
official
act
in
the
middle.
and--
mr.
eric
w.
bloom
--well,
i...
i--
mr.
eric
w.
bloom
--well,
i
think
that's
correct.
mr.
eric
w.
bloom
well,
certainly,
i
think
what
the
jury
would
infer
there
is
i'm
giving
the
money
so
that
he
will
act
favorably
with
respect
to
us,
with
respect
to
these
10
matters
we
have
pending.
mr.
eric
w.
bloom
if
it's
a
quid
pro
quo--
mr.
eric
w.
bloom
--right.
if
there's
an
implicit
agreement,
i
mean,
that's
going
to
be
a
question
in
fact
for
the
jury.
mr.
eric
w.
bloom
if
that's
all
there
is...
if
that's
all
there
is--
mr.
eric
w.
bloom
--then
it
may
well
be
a
gratuity.
and
all
we
would
say
is,
in
the
indictment,
identify
what
those
acts
are
that
are
pending.
mr.
eric
w.
bloom
to
make
acts
more
likely.
mr.
eric
w.
bloom
yes.
mr.
eric
w.
bloom
well--
mr.
eric
w.
bloom
--well,
i
was
going
to
say,
several
courts
have.
the
reason
why
we
haven't
is
because
the
words
"for
or
because
of"
we
think
are
probably
broad
enough
to
capture
not
only
a
reward,
but
it
probably
embraces
improper
attempts
to
influence,
where
it
does
not
rise
to
the
level
of
bribery.
mr.
eric
w.
bloom
well,
i...
i
disagree.
oh,
no,
i
don't
disagree,
because
it's
actually
close,
but
it's...
it's
still
a
long
way
from...
from
home.
in
fact,
this
is
really,
i
think,
the
key,
as
i
understand
it,
to
the
independent
counsel's
argument.
the
independent
counsel
says,
in
this
case--
mr.
eric
w.
bloom
--i'm
sorry.
the
government.
thank
you.
in
this
case,
sun-diamond
is
a
regulated
entity.
therefore,
we
don't
have
to
prove
it's
for
or
because
of
any
official
act.
we
merely
have
to
prove
it
was
for
or
because
of
an
official
position.
essentially,
as
i
understand
what
the
government
is
doing
here,
is
they
are
saying
that
there
are
two
classes
of
potential
defendants.
and
the
matter
of
proof
is
different,
depending
on
whether
or
not
you
are
within
one
class
or
the
other.
mr.
eric
w.
bloom
yes,
i
do.
and
i
think...
and
i
don't
think
we
should
presume
that
because
they
like
to
be
around
cabinet
officers,
that
because
it
happens
to
be
the
secretary
of
agriculture,
that
it
must
have
been
for
or
because
of
an
official
act.
mr.
eric
w.
bloom
yes.
and
that's
obviously
our
concern
here.
the
jury
did
not
get
that
question.
and,
look,
the
jury
can
take
a
look
at
a
lot
of
factors
to
determine
whether
or
not
it
should
make
the
inference
that
indeed
the
gift
is
for
or
because
of
an
official
act.
the
jury
may
take
a
look
at
the
fact
that
the
entity
giving
the
gifts
has
matters
pending.
mr.
eric
w.
bloom
i
think
it
could
be
a
factor,
yes.
i
mean,
clearly,
what
i
would
think
are
the
most--
mr.
eric
w.
bloom
--i
tend
to
be
partial
to
the
plain
vanilla
circumstantial
evidence
that
we
get
in
all
the
jury
instructions.
what
i
do
believe--
mr.
eric
w.
bloom
--i
don't
believe
so.
i
don't
believe
so.
mr.
eric
w.
bloom
well,
we
certainly
agree
a
lot
with
the
department
of
justice,
in
that
it's
generally
a
jury
matter
to
determine
the
issue
of
intent.
we
probably
disagree
with
the
solicitor
general,
i
could
think
of,
in
three
ways.
first,
the
solicitor
general
says
that
based
on
the
regulatory
relationship
only,
a
jury
should
be
able
to
infer
guilt
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
we
agree
that
the
substantiality
of
the
gifts
and
the
fact
that
there
are
matters
pending
are
in
fact
factors
for
the...
for
the
jury
to
consider.
and
i
think
we
can't
decide
in
a
vacuum
whether
or
not
that
would
be
sufficient
from
which
a
reasonable
jury
can
find
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
that
gifts
were
given
for
or
because
of
an
official
act.
second--
mr.
eric
w.
bloom
--i
would
prefer--
mr.
eric
w.
bloom
--i
would
prefer
a
broader
charge,
that...
that
instructs
the
jury--
mr.
eric
w.
bloom
--it...
it
may
be.
i,
frankly,
think
it
may
be
a
bit
prejudicial.
the
charge,
if
i
may,
that
i
would
suggest
to
the
jury
is
that
the
jury
may
consider
the
substantiality
of
the
gifts,
both
to
the
donor
and
to
the
donee,
the
substantiality
of
the
interests
to
the
donor,
the
timing
of
the
gifts
vis-a-vis
acts.
mr.
eric
w.
bloom
sure.
the
second
place
where
we
disagree
with
the
solicitor
general
is
that
at
one
point
it
seems
to
us
that
he
equates
capacity
to
act
with
act.
and
i
believe
that
capacity
to
act
is
an
awful
lot
like
position,
and
suggests
status.
for
example,
i
may
want
to
hobnob
with
someone
who
has
the
capacity
to
act
because
it
will
enhance
my
prestige.
the
third
place
where
we
disagree
is
specifically
on
the...
whether
or
not
the
statute
requires
a
nexus
to
a
particular
act
or
just
a
general
act.
aside
from
that,
i
think--
mr.
eric
w.
bloom
--absolutely
not,
your
honor.
mr.
eric
w.
bloom
i
suspect
that
the
answer
is
yes.
but,
to
be
candid,
the
converse
of
that
question
says,
could
i,
as
a
defendant,
prevail
on
a
rule
29
motion?
and
i
will
tell
you
that
i,
as
a
defense
counsel,
would
make
a
very
strong
rule
29
motion,
based
on
the
facts
in
this
case,
that
no
rational
trier
of
fact
could
find
sun-diamond
guilty
on
this
record.
mr.
eric
w.
bloom
certainly.
there
were
two
matters
that
the
government
proved
were
pending.
one
was
the
mpp,
the
grant
program.
mr.
eric
w.
bloom
the
evidence
was
that
sun-diamond
wanted...
wanted
the
secretary...
this
is...
i'm
sorry,
this
is
the...
the
indictment...
alleged
that
sun-diamond
wanted
the
secretary
to
adopt
a
definition
of
a
small
entity
to
cover
its
member
cooperatives.
yet
the
evidence
at
trial
was
that
richard
douglas
told
the
secretary
this
is
probably
something
that
is
better
left
for
congress.
that's
one.
there's
no
effort
and
there's
no
evidence
to
reflect
an
effort
to
influence
the
secretary
of
agriculture
in
any
way
to
assist
sun-diamond.
the
second
matter
that
was
pending
dealt
with
the
issue
of
methyl
bromide.
methyl
bromide
is
a
fumigant
that
the
epa
was
proposing
to
phase
out.
the
history,
i
would
argue,
of
the
usda
was
opposing
the
phaseout.
indeed,
the
evidence
in
the
record
demonstrates
that
the
usda
was
the
largest
user
of
methyl
bromide.
mr.
eric
w.
bloom
that
is
correct.
mr.
eric
w.
bloom
what
i
was
going
to
go
back
to
is
the
issue
of
these
two
classes,
and
the
fact
that
because
sun-diamond
is
a
regulated
entity,
somehow
we
deserve
a
different
standard.
i
think,
effectively,
what
that
does
is
create
an
impermissible
irrebuttable
presumption.
that
is,
if
the
jury
were
to
find...
and
if
the
jury
did
find...
that
sun-diamond
gave
gifts
for
or
because
of
any
official
position,
then
the
court,
as
a
matter
of
law,
was
saying,
then
sun-diamond
must
have
given
it
for
or
because
of
any
official
act.
and
under
in
re
winship,
of
course,
it
is
the
government's
burden
to
prove
each
and
every
element
of
the
offense
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
i
wanted
to
go
back,
also
to
the
issue
of
this
hierarchy
of
conduct.
clearly,
at
the
top
of
the
hierarchy
is
bribery.
clearly,
below
that
we
have
the
gratuity
as
a
reward.
in
our
view,
at
the
bottom
is
for
or
because
of
an
official
position,
which
is
governed,
we
believe,
administratively.
there
is
a
question
as
to
whether
or
not
there
is
a
gap
between
bribery
and
the
gratuity.
does
bribery...
clearly,
bribery
covers
improper
attempts
to
influence.
clearly,
gratuity
covers
the
issue
of
rewards.
the
difficult
issue
is
whether
or
not
there
is
a
gap
that
is
filled
by
the
gratuity
statute.
and
that's
why
i'm
partial
to
the
language
of
the
court
of
appeals
that
says,
essentially,
we
don't
have
to
decide
what
the
bribery
statute
line
is.
but
wherever
we
draw
that
line,
the
gap
will
be
filled
by
the
gratuity
statute.
to
conclude,
we
believe
that
the
district
court,
by
instructing
the
jury
that
the
government
did
not
have
to
prove
that
sun-diamond
gave
gifts
for
any
act
at
all
stripped
the
jury
of
its
fact-finding
mission.
it
simply
did
not
have
an
opportunity
to
decide
the
one
question
that
was
crucial
to
this
case.
that
question
was
purposefully
kept
away
from
the
jury
because
the
government
argued,
and
the
district
court
agreed,
that
no
connection
needed
to
be
shown.
that
relieved
the
government
of
its
constitutional
obligation
to
prove
every
element
of
the
offense
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
that
was
error.
and
for
that
reason,
we
therefore
ask
for
this
court
to
affirm
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals.
