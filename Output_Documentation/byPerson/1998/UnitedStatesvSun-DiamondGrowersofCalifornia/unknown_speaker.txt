unknown
speaker
well,
counsel,
i
thought
that
the
section
we're
looking
at,
(c)(1)(a),
says
that
it
covers
the
situation
where
the
defendant
directly
or
indirectly
gives
anything
of
value
to
a
public
official
for
or
because
of
any
official
act
performed
or
to
be
performed
by
that
official.
unknown
speaker
there
is
a
link
there
between
an
act
performed
or
to
be
performed.
it
isn't
baking
brownies
for
the
senator
or
knitting
a
pair
of
socks
for
some
public
official,
is
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
but
that's
quite
different
from
linking
it
to
an
act
performed
or
to
be
performed.
and
you
want
to
say
that
anything
given
because
the
official
is
an
official
is
enough.
unknown
speaker
but
isn't...
isn't
the
difficulty,
or
one
of
the
difficulties,
for
your
position,
at
least
with
respect
to
these
instructions,
that
the
judge,
in
giving
the
instructions,
went
so
far
as
to
say
that
there...
literally,
there
need
be
no
link
with
any
act
at
all?
and
at
that
point,
even
assuming
there's
some...
there's
some
merit
to
your
argument,
it
seems
to
me,
at
that
point,
the
judge
just
totally
untethered
the...
the...
if
you
will,
the
position
from
the...
from
the
capacity
to
act
or
the
anticipation
of
action.
and...
and
even
if
we
were
to
accept
your
position,
we...
wouldn't
we
have
to
find
error
in...
in
that
instruction?
unknown
speaker
well,
he
sure
did
that.
[laughter]
but,
i
mean,
he
went
a
lot
further
than
that,
didn't
he?
i
mean,
the
bribery...
the
bribery
offense,
as...
as
we've
described
it,
requires
a...
a
fairly
specific
quid
pro
quo
kind
of
link,
specific
act,
specific
gift.
this
went
far
beyond
anything
that
would
be
appropriate
to
distinguish
this
from
the
bribery
statute.
unknown
speaker
but
that
isn't
what
he
said.
he
said
it
doesn't
have
to
be
linked
to
any
act.
unknown
speaker
which...
which
seems
to
go
much
further.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
know
that's
your
position,
but
why
does
it
make
sense?
that
is
to
say,
why
should
we
read
a
criminal
statute
to
suddenly
make
a
group
of
old-age
home
residents
decide
to...
to
send
a
little
present
because
they
think
the
senator
has
been
generally
in
favor
of
old-age
homes?
or...
i
mean,
why
should
you
have
such
an
expansive
reading
of
a
criminal
statute
when
there
are
a
large
number
of
ethics
rules
and
other
noncriminal
matters
that
adequately,
at
least
arguably,
control
conduct
like
this
when
it
is
unethical?
why
should
we
give
prosecutors
such
broad
discretion
to
prosecute
people
who
may
have
done
things
that
are
not
even
immoral?
that...
that's
the
general
kind
of
question
that
i'd
like
you
to
address.
unknown
speaker
mr....
mr.
ray,
my...
my...
my
problem
is
just
the
opposite
of...
of
justice
breyer's.
i...
i
don't
find
it
at
all
amazing
that
congress
should
seek
to
write
a
statute
of
the
sort
that
you
say
this
is.
and
the
reason
i
don't
find
it
amazing
is
that
they
already
have,
but
in
a
different
section
of
the
united
states
code.
and
the
problem
is
that
we
normally
interpret
a
statute
in
such
fashion
as
not
to
duplicate
something
else
that
is
already
on
the
books.
how
does
this
statute,
as
you
interpret
it,
differ
from
5
u.s.c.,
section
7353,
which
prohibits
federal
employees
from
accepting
anything
of
value
from
persons,
quote,
whose
interests
may
be
substantially
affected
by
the
performance
or
nonperformance
of
the
individual's
official
duties?
that
sounds
like
your...
your
very
argument.
unknown
speaker
what's
the
difference
between
those
two,
then?
unknown
speaker
well,
this
one
is
included
within
the
other
one,
you
mean?
the
other
one
requires
even
less.
unknown
speaker
to
the
employee.
unknown
speaker
i
see.
unknown
speaker
well,
but
it
still
duplicates
the
other.
i
mean,
the
one
is
a
lesser
included
of
the
other,
it
seems
to
me.
the
one
statute
says,
if
you
accept
it
from
someone
who
can
be
affected
by
your
decisions,
knowing
that
he
is
giving
it
to
you
because
you...
he...
he
is
affected
by
your
decisions,
you're
guilty.
that's
your...
that's
your
statute.
this
statute
says,
if
you
accept
it
from
somebody
who
may
be
substantially
affected
by
your...
your
decisions,
even
if
he
doesn't
know
that
he
may
be
substantially
affected
by
your
decisions,
you're
guilty.
unknown
speaker
it
doesn't
make
sense
to
have
two
statutes
overlapping
like
that.
unknown
speaker
this
is
not
a
regulation.
i...
i
can
understand
how
a
regulation
may
go
further
than
a
statute,
and
render
any
violation
of
the
regulation
automatically
a
violation
of
the
statute.
but
this
is
another
statute.
and
it...
it...
since
there
is
another
way
to
read
the
statute
that...
that
you're
prosecuting
under
here,
i'm...
i'm
inclined
to
read
it
in
such
fashion
that
it
will
do
something
different,
insofar
as
the
employee
is
concerned,
than
7353
does.
unknown
speaker
well,
the
other
statute
doesn't
purport
to
deal
with
donors,
does
it?
unknown
speaker
but...
but
the
point
still
remains,
if
there's
more
than
one
plausible
reading
of...
of
the
statute,
why
should
we
adopt
that
reading
that
creates
such
a
large
gap
between
the
law
and
everyday
practice?
unknown
speaker
i
mean,
the
cookie
hypothetical
and...
and
any
number
of
such
ones.
unless
we're
just
going
to
rely
on
prosecutorial--
unknown
speaker
--but
that's
exactly
the
problem.
unknown
speaker
that's...
i
mean,
my
position
was,
when
i
asked
you
the
question,
was
the
same,
i
think,
as
justice
scalia's:
5
u.s.c.,
7353
is
not
a
criminal
statute,
is
it?
unknown
speaker
all
right.
so,
this
kind
of
area,
i
gathered
from
what
you
prosecute,
sometimes
every
public
official
is
sometimes
invited
to
go
on
a
trip,
to
speak
to
people.
they...
they
might
give
him
dinner.
they...
they
might...
and
evidently,
some
of
those
things
are
sometimes
actually
prosecuted.
well,
why
not,
given
the
difficulties
in
this
area,
assume
that
congress
intended
this
general
kind
of
present-giving;
i.e.,
we
invite
you
on
a
trip
to
speak
to
a
trade
association,
or
give...
that
kind
of
thing
should
be
handled
by
civil
regulations
rather
than
somebody
bringing
the
blunderbuss
of
the
criminal
law
in...
into
the
prosecutor's
arsenal,
where
they
could
prosecute
trivial
things?
unknown
speaker
but
the
congress
didn't
say
position;
and
that's
the
problem.
you
were
about
to
give
us
a
safe
harbor,
but
the
charge
to
the
jury
was
that
the
gratuity
statute
makes
it
a
crime
to
give
a
public
official
a
thing
of
value
because
of
his
official
position,
now,
whether
or
not
the
giver
or
receiver
intended
that
particular
official's
acts
to
be
influenced.
so,
that
seems
to
say
it's
because
of
the
official
position,
whether
or
not
there
was
any
intent
that...
that
the...
that
the
official's
acts...
the
official's
acts,
very
broadly...
not
particular
acts,
but
the
particular
official's
acts,
be
influenced.
first,
i
had
a
question
of
how
this
charge
came
to
be.
was
this
a
result
of
a
request
to
charge
by
the
prosecution?
unknown
speaker
but
this
particular
charge
was
proposed
by--
unknown
speaker
--was--
--by
whom?
unknown
speaker
but
you
made
it...
you
could
have
done
the
same
thing
using
the
words
of
the
act
instead
of
you
inserting
the
word
"position".
unknown
speaker
but...
but
it
may
be
that
no
specific
act
is
required,
but
it
still
would...
the
language
would
suggest
that
perhaps
a
somewhat
more
amorphous
future
possible
acts
on
the
part
of
the
official.
unknown
speaker
but
there
is
a
difference,
don't
you
think?
i
mean,
one
could
give
a
gratuity
to
somebody
because
he
just
likes...
you
know,
who
had
no
connection
with
ag...
agriculture
at
all,
just
because
he
likes
to
sit
next
to
the
secretary
at
a
football
game
or
something
like
that.
and
i
don't
think
that
would
come
within
the
language
of
the
statute.
and
yet
that's
given
to
him
because
of
his
official
position.
unknown
speaker
well,
but
i
think
you've--
--but
it's
at
least...
at
least
confusing
if...
if
the
jury...
you've
just
isolated
this
sentence:
thing
of
value,
because
of
official
position,
whether
or
not
there
was
an
intent
to
influence
acts.
if
you
just
took
that
out
and...
i
mean,
it...
it
just
says:
official
position.
unknown
speaker
well,
may
i
ask
you
about
your...
the
distinction
that
you
are
drawing
on
201,
will
vary
greatly
depending
on
whether
we
use
the
word
"acts"
as
our
focus
or
"position"
as
our
focus.
what
i'm
getting
at
is
the...
the
phrase...
what
is
it...
for...
for
or
because
of...
if
we
say
that
a...
a
gift
violates
the
statute
if
it's
given
for
or
because
of
the
position,
then
i
think
it
follows
quite
readily
from
what...
as
you
have
been
saying...
that
the
notion
of
intent
to
influence
is
outside
the
statute;
it's
not
the
focus
of
the
statute.
unknown
speaker
but
if...
if
we...
if
we
go
back
to
the
original
language,
and
we
speak
of
for
or
because
of
acts,
then
it
becomes
quite
implausible,
in...
in
a
way,
i...
i
suppose,
suggested
by
judge
wald's
remark,
to
think
of
a
gift
that
might
plausibly
be
given
for
or
because
of
acts
which
wasn't
intended
to
influence
the
way
those
acts
were
performed.
would
you
comment
on
that?
so,
i
guess
my
point
is,
if
we...
if
we
accept
the
equation
of
position
and
acts,
then
the
notion
of
intending
to
influence
really
does
seem
to
drop
out.
but
if
we
stick
to
the
text,
and
we
say
"for
or
because
of
acts,
then
the
notion
of
intending
to
influence,
it
seems
to
me,
is
rather
hard
to
get
out
of
the
statute.
"
unknown
speaker
well,
would
you...
would
you...
would
you
request...
would
it
be
appropriate
for
a
judge
to
say,
in
charging
under
this
statute,
whether
or
not
there
was
any,
even
general
intent,
on
the
part
of
the
donor
to
influence
the
official
in
the
manner
in
which
the
official
performed
his
acts
is
totally
irrelevant;
would
that
be
a
correct
instruction?
unknown
speaker
well,
let's
just
talk
as
lawyers
now
for
a
minute.
as
a
technical
statement
of
law,
would
that
instruction
have
been
right
or
wrong
on
your
view?
unknown
speaker
that's...
that's
right.
unknown
speaker
was...
was
the
instruction
right
or
wrong?
unknown
speaker
no,
i'm...
i'm
talking
about
my
hypothetical
instruction.
unknown
speaker
would
that
have
been
right
or
wrong?
unknown
speaker
it
doesn't
seem
to
me
that...
that
the
choice
is...
is
between
reading
this
statute
as...
as
one
that...
that
requires
an
intent
to
influence
and
reading
it
as
one
that
requires
merely
giving
a
gift
because
of
a
person's
office.
it
seems
to
me
this
statute
covers
a
situation
in
which
you
reward
someone
for
an
act
already
performed.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
think
that's...
that's
a
part
of
it
that
doesn't
trouble
me,
but
it's
a
good
deal
short
of
saying
that
any
gift
because
of
a
person's
office
comes
within
the
statute.
i
mean,
let's
assume
that
the...
the
person
has...
has
come
out
with
a
ruling
that...
that
greatly
favors
a
particular
company.
and
then
the...
then
the
company
gives
him
$10,000.
now,
you
couldn't
get
that
under
the
bribery
statute
because
the
decision
was
already
made.
unknown
speaker
but
you
could
get
it
under
this
statute,
right?
unknown
speaker
well,
why
isn't
that
enough?
why
do
we
have
to
go
further,
and
say,
whenever
you
give
a
gift
to
a...
to
a
public
official,
you're
covered?
unknown
speaker
well,
suppose...
suppose
the...
the
official
has
announced
that
he
will
perform
an
act,
and
then...
but
he
hasn't
performed
it
yet...
he
then
gets
the
gratuity
or
the
reward
justice
scalia
describes.
unknown
speaker
i...
i
think...
i
think
that
would
be
covered
by
the
statute.
and
that
also
explains
the
"to
be
performed"
language.
unknown
speaker
but
if...
if
he
has
under...
if
the
official
has
under
advisement
a
proposed
regulation,
i
think
the...
your
view
is
it
would
be
covered--
unknown
speaker
--because
it's
an
act
to
be
performed.
unknown
speaker
well,
where
are
we
lacking?
unknown
speaker
well,
mr.
ray,
it
could
well
be
that
the
evidence
in
this
case
could
support
a
conviction
by
a
properly
instructed
jury.
and
i
think
the
question
is
whether
the
jury
is
properly
instructed
here.
let
me
ask
you
this.
the...
you
have
filed
this
petition
on
behalf
of
the
independent
counsel.
unknown
speaker
and
the
solicitor
general
has
filed
a
separate
brief
on
behalf,
i
guess,
of
the
department
of
justice.
unknown
speaker
how
does
the
solicitor
general's
position
differ
from
yours,
would
you
say?
unknown
speaker
did
you...
i
really
didn't
read
the
solicitor
general's
brief
as
being
identical
to
yours.
you
really
think
it's
the
exact
same
position
you
maintain?
unknown
speaker
so,
we
can
rely
entirely
on
his
brief,
and
you'll
be
satisfied?
unknown
speaker
well,
why
not?
why
not?
unknown
speaker
what
are
the
obvious
reasons?
they're
not
obvious
to
me.
unknown
speaker
what
are
the
obvious
reasons?
unknown
speaker
how...
how
does
it
work,
in
your
opinion?
suppose
a...
a
group
of
farmers
asks
the
secretary
of
agriculture
to
come
and
talk
to
us.
they
say,
we'd
like
you
to
tell
us
about
the
department's
policies
that
affect
us.
here
is
the
ticket,
or
we'll
buy
you
lunch.
it's
a
banquet.
bring
your
wife
to
the
banquet.
in
your
view,
is
that
a
federal
crime?
unknown
speaker
and
if
not,
why
not?
unknown
speaker
no,
no.
what
they
want
is
they
definitely
want
him
to
come
out,
indeed,
what
they
want
him
to
do
is
talk
about
price
supports.
they're
in
favor
of
price
supports.
they
want
him
to
talk
at
lunch.
unknown
speaker
what
do
you
mean
"untethered"?
they
want
him
to
talk
about
official
action.
they
want
him
to
talk
about
his
policies
as
secretary
of
agriculture.
i
give
you
the
example,
and
i
want
to
know,
in
your
opinion,
how
does
this
statute
apply?
unknown
speaker
it's
a
federal
crime,
in
your
opinion?
unknown
speaker
yes,
yes.
of
course,
farmers
do.
they
all
do.
that's
what
the
secretary
of
agriculture
does.
he
decides
things
that
affect
farmers.
unknown
speaker
and,
therefore,
if
farmers
who
ask
the
secretary
to
speak,
to
come
to
lunch,
to
talk
about
his
policies,
are
all
committing
federal
crimes.
i
would
have
thought
that
was
fairly
common.
i
may
not
understand--
unknown
speaker
--business.
unknown
speaker
in
any
case,
you're
saying--
--do
you
think
any
public
officials
in
washington
will
be
surprised
by
your
interpretation?
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
i'm
serious
about
that.
there's
a
huge
gap
between
the
general
understanding
and
your
interpretation.
and
if...
and
if
the
statute
is
open
to
two
plausible
interpretations,
it
seems
to
me
that
we
shouldn't
adopt
yours
for
that
reason.
unknown
speaker
they
don't
go...
i
would
have
thought
it
was
good
for
secretaries
of
agriculture
to
explain
to
farmers
what
their
policies
will
be
in
the
future.
i
mean,
is
it
now
the...
the
general
understanding
that
they
don't?
unknown
speaker
you
may
answer
the
question.
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
i
think
you've
answered
the
question,
mr.
ray.
unknown
speaker
thank
you.
we'll
hear
from
you,
mr.
bloom.
unknown
speaker
but
do
you...
do
you--
--in
the
district
court?
unknown
speaker
do
you
contend
that
was
erroneous?
unknown
speaker
do
you
contend
that
that
statement
was
erroneous,
about
the
direct
nexus?
unknown
speaker
well,
that's
way,
way
back
in
time
in...
in
the
proceedings.
i
mean,
it's
something
the
government
said
in
opposition
or
a
motion
to
dismiss
in
the
district
court.
how
does
that
bear
on
what
we
have
here?
the
government
may
have
changed
its
position.
unknown
speaker
we've
got
half
an
hour.
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
--it's
the
united
states
that's
the
petitioner
here.
unknown
speaker
do
you
say
it
has
to
be
because
of
some
particular
official
act?
unknown
speaker
specific
or
identifiable.
well,
i
mean...
i
mean,
let's
say
i'm...
i'm
at&t,
and
i
just
give
enormous
quantities
of
money
to
the
chairman
of
the
federal
communications
commission.
unknown
speaker
that
doesn't
violate
this
act?
unknown
speaker
saying,
you
know,
i'm
not
asking
you
to
do
anything
in
particular.
i
have
no
particular
case
in
mind.
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
i
just...
i
just
want
you...
just...
i
just
want
you
to
be
a
friend;
that's
all.
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
no,
no.
wait.
you
have
to
take
my
hypothetical.
there
is
no
particular
matter
that
at&t
mentioned
to
the
chairman.
it
just
said,
you
know,
i
just
love
chairmen
of
the
fcc.
they
are
wonderful
people.
they're...
you
know,
they
could
make
a
lot
more
money
elsewhere.
i...
this
is
in
appreciation
of
your
taking
all
this
time
out
to
serve
the
people.
and
i...
you
know,
here's
a
couple
of
million
dollars.
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
no
particular
act.
unknown
speaker
my
question
was...
was
not
whether
he
could
be
charged
under
one
of
the
other
statutes.
it's
whether
he
can
be
charged
under
this
statute.
unknown
speaker
is
no?
unknown
speaker
now,
in
your
view,
what's
the...
tell
me
what
the
distinction
is
between
the
requirement
of...
the
specificity
requirement
of
this
statute
and
the
specificity
requirement
of
the
bribery
statute.
unknown
speaker
well,
the
quid
pro
quo
is
the
agreement
that
connects
the...
the
thing
given
with
a
specific
act.
unknown
speaker
it
doesn't
have
to...
the
act
doesn't
have
to
be
completed
to
violate
the
bribery
statute--
unknown
speaker
--we
agree
on
that.
so...
so,
there's...
there's
a
specific
gift,
specific
act.
now,
you've
been
talking
about...
i
think...
about
specific
acts
under
the
gratuity
statute.
so,
what's...
how
do
we
distinguish
between
the
two?
unknown
speaker
well,
then
there
is
no...
then
i...
maybe
i
misunderstood
your
position.
there
is
no
specificity
requirement
under
the...
specificity
as
to
the
act
requirement
under
the
gratuity
statute
on
your
view;
is
that
correct?
unknown
speaker
okay,
we're
back
to
the
specific.
what's
the
difference
between
the
one
or
more
acts
that
he's
got
to
identify
for
the
gratuity
statute
and
the
identification
of
one
or
more
acts
under
the
bribery
statute?
unknown
speaker
well,
the
quid
pro
quo...
and
correct
me
here...
i
thought
quid
pro
quo
meant
that
there
was
an
agreement
that
the...
that
the
gift
would
be
in
exchange
for
action
in
this
particular
instance.
unknown
speaker
all
right.
and
i
think
what
you're
saying
is,
if
you
have
to...
the
only
difference,
then,
is
you
don't
get
too
explicit
about
the
agreement
under
the
gratuity
statute.
unknown
speaker
you've
got
an...
you've
got
an
explicit...
you've
got
a...
you've
got
a
particular
gift,
and
you've
got
a
specific
act
in
mind,
and
the
prosecutor
has
got
to
show
it
and
prove
it,
but
we
just
don't
get
down
to
so
many
words
in
identifying...
when...
when
we're
giving
the
gift,
we
don't
get
down
to
so
many
words
in
identifying
the
connection
between
this
gift
and
this
act;
that's
the
difference?
unknown
speaker
okay.
but...
but
the
distinction
is
simply
one
of...
of
explicitness,
of
a
lack
of
articulation
of
the
connection;
is
that
your
position?
unknown
speaker
then
why
does
the
prosecutor
have
to
prove
specific
acts?
unknown
speaker
when
you
were
asking...
if
you're
arguing
this,
then
you're
going
beyond
where
the
court
of
appeals
went,
because
the
court
of
appeals
didn't
say
it
had
to
be
this
act
or
that
act.
it...
didn't
the
court
of
appeals
contemplate
a
multitude
of
acts
that
might
be
in
the
agency's
bailiwick?
unknown
speaker
and
you
say
that's...
that's
wrong?
unknown
speaker
well,
why?
why
is
it...
i...
i
am
confused
by
the
two.
i
thought
the
classical
bribe
is
i
want
the
public
official
to
do
something
for
me.
and,
moreover,
i
go
to
him
and
say,
i'll
pay
you
$1,000
if
you
do
x.
and
it's
a
fairly
specific
thing.
i
thought
the
classical
gratuity
is
what
it
says;
it's
a
tip.
the
person
did
it
anyway.
i
say,
thank
you;
thank
you
for
giving
me
48
million
acres.
thank
you.
and
here's
your
tip,
$1,000.
now,
normally,
that
would
be
in
the
past.
he
would
have
done
it.
but
sometimes,
i
guess,
it
could
be
in
the
future.
he
just
doesn't
know
i
want
him
to
do
it,
but
he
does
it--
unknown
speaker
--independently,
and
i
give
him
a
tip.
and
i
give
him
a
tip
for
what...
i
mean,
i
don't
understand
how
the
future
works.
but
if
that's
the
distinction,
you
don't
need
any
agreement
whatsoever
in
the
gratuity
case.
none.
nor
does
it
matter
that
you're
trying
to
influence
him.
it
couldn't
matter
less
that
you're
trying
to
influence
him.
influence
has
nothing
to
do
with
it.
now,
am
i
right?
explain...
i'm
not
at
all
sure
i'm
right.
unknown
speaker
well,
how...
how
about
the
"to
be
performed"
part
of
the
statute?
unknown
speaker
well,
but
committed
to
perform
is
bribery.
unknown
speaker
that's
simply
reading
out
the
part
of
the
statute
that
says
"to
be
performed".
unknown
speaker
well,
don't
ask
me
questions.
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
but
then
the
dif...
the
difficult...
why
this
case
isn't
so
totally
obvious,
is
because...
take
a
gratuity
statute...
you'd
say
that
that...
that,
okay,
i
understand
perfectly
well
you're
giving
a
person
a
tip.
that's
what
you're
not
supposed
to
do.
well,
you
don't
give
a
person
a
tip
for
being
who
he
is;
that's
clear...
i
don't
think...
that's
not
a
tip.
so,
being
in
a
position,
no,
that's
not
in
the
statute.
but
it
isn't
so
clear
that
it
has
to
be
an
absolutely
precise
act.
you
could
give...
you
could
be
giving
a
person
a
tip
because
of
a
whole
series
of
things
that
he
did
or
a
whole
series
of
things
that
he
now
has
promised
to
do.
what
a
good
guy
he
is.
he
says:
i
promise
to
buy
this
piece
of
property
next
year.
that's
to
be
performed.
you
say:
that's
wonderful.
now,
he
doesn't
say
to
buy
this
piece
of
property,
he
says
to
buy
some
property.
now,
he
doesn't
say
to
buy
some
property,
he
says
to
take
a
certain
course
of
action.
and
then
it
becomes
vaguer
and
vaguer.
and
that
doesn't
necessarily
stop
it
from
being
a
tip.
and
that's
why
i
think
this
case
isn't
obvious,
one
way
or
the
other.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
what's
your
response?
unknown
speaker
yeah,
but
you've
got
to
argue
that
this
general
course
of
conduct
is
not
something
that
falls
within
the
statute.
rather,
you
want
it
to
be
more
specific
acts.
unknown
speaker
but...
but
judge
williams
didn't
say
that.
indeed,
i
think
he
rejected
your
position.
you
called
our
attention
to
page
8
in
the
appendix.
if
you
look
at
page
13
and
14,
where
judge
williams
said:
at
the
same
time,
we
reject
sun-diamond's
broader
tack
on
the
indictment--
--where
are
you
reading
from?
appendix
page
13.
the...
the
paragraph--
--okay,
thank
you.
--at
the
end
of
the
page.
okay.
where
the
d.c.
circuit
said
that
it
isn't
necessary
to
tie
the
particular
free
service
provided
to
particular
ticket
or
tickets.
leniency
in
a
multitude
of
specific
acts
was
enough.
that
an
official
has
an
abundance
of
relative...
relevant
matters
on
his
plate
should
not
in...
insulate
him
from
the
gratuity
statute.
unknown
speaker
i...
okay,
let's
use
a
hypothetical.
i...
the
new
chairman
of
the
fcc,
and
at&t
comes
in
and
says:
you're
going
to
have
a
multitude
of
acts
in
your
office.
and,
you
know,
no
specific
one,
but
here's
$2
million;
think
well
of
us
in
all
of
these...
in
everything
you
do
in
this
office.
[laughter]
okay.
is
that
a
violation?
unknown
speaker
what
specific
acts
are
involved?
unknown
speaker
it's
just
everything
he
does.
it's
just
everything
he
does
in
his
office.
which
is
why
it's
not
a
very...
a
very
far
stretch
to
say
that
i'm
giving
him
the
money
because
of
his
office.
because
everything
that
he
does
as
chairman
of
the
fcc--
unknown
speaker
--or
at
least
everything
that
affects
point-to-point
telecommunications.
unknown
speaker
to
influence...
in...
in
the
hypothetical,
here
is
the
money,
now
think
well
of
us.
i'm
giving
you
some
money.
please,
think
well
of
us.
that's
bribery,
not
a
gratuity,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
it's
not...
if...
if
i'm
giving
you
the
money
because
you
will
think
well
of
us,
it's
a
gratuity.
unknown
speaker
if
i'm
giving
you
the
money
in
order
to,
is
it
bribery?
or
may...
maybe
i'm
not
right
about
that.
unknown
speaker
well,
that's...
that's...
you
don't
think
it's
a...
it's
a
violation
of
the
bribery
statute,
do
you?
unknown
speaker
but
i
haven't
asked
for
any
commitment
on
his
part.
you...
you've
been
telling
us
that
there
has
to
be
an
agreement.
unknown
speaker
how
is
it
an
implicit
agreement
when
i
say,
here,
please,
think
well
of
us?
unknown
speaker
that...
that
was
my
hypothetical.
unknown
speaker
well,
but
then,
also,
if
he
rules
against
the
giver
in
every
case,
it
would
pretty
clearly
not
be
a
bribery,
but
it
would
clearly
still
be
a
gratuity
if
the
gift
was
given
in
order
to
motivate
him
to...
to
act
favorably.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
and
is
it
possible
to
interpret
the
statute
so
that
it
has
a
retroactive
reach?
there
has
to
be
a
commitment
to
take
an
act
or
an
act
has
to
be
taken?
unknown
speaker
you
apparently
don't
take
that
position.
unknown
speaker
the
problem,
once
you
do
that,
and
couple
the
analysis
with
the
possibility
of
being
multiple,
specific
acts,
or
at
least
more
than
one,
you're
very
close
to
"official
position".
unknown
speaker
the
government.
unknown
speaker
well,
but
at
least
it
was
permissible...
it
would
be
permissible
for
the
jury
to
find
that,
in
that
case.
unknown
speaker
is
one
of
those
factors
whether
or
not
the
receiving
official
could
reasonably
interpret,
or
should
reasonably
interpret,
the
action
as
being
designed
to
reward
a
particular
official
act?
unknown
speaker
should
you
instruct
the
jury
to
that
effect
in
every
case?
unknown
speaker
you
keep
saying
"specific
act".
you
keep
using
that
term.
but...
but
the
kind
of
hypotheticals
you're
accepting
do
not
have
"specific
act".
why
isn't
it
enough
that
the
person
gave
the
money
to
obtain
favorable
action
in
the
abstract?
i
gave
him
money
just
because,
you
know,
you
have
been
a
friend
to
at&t
over
the
years,
in...
in
your
position
as
chairman.
i'm
not
referring
to
any
particular
decisions.
and
if
the
government
had
to
come
up
with
the
particular
ones
that
it
was
given
for,
you
couldn't
identify
any
particular
ones.
but
i
think
you'd
be
under
the
statute
if
you
said,
i'm
just
giving
you
this
because
you
have
been
a
good
friend
to
our
company
over
the
years.
wouldn't
that
be
a
violation
of
the
statute?
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask--
--well,
it
would
be
if--
--may
i
just...
one
question,
if
i
may.
would
you
tell
me
the
difference
between
your
position
and
the
position
of
the
department
of
justice
in
their
separate
brief?
unknown
speaker
could
you
clarify
that
in
terms
of
an
instruction?
suppose
the
judge
said:
you
may,
but
are
not
required,
to
infer
from
the
fact
that
this
corporation
has
matters,
or
this
entity,
has
matters
pending
before
the
agency
that
this
gift
was
given
to
influence
official
acts.
unknown
speaker
would
that
be
a
proper
charge?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
didn't
ask
whether
you
preferred
it;
i
asked
if
that
would
be
a
legally
correct
charge?
unknown
speaker
would
you
finish
your
answer
to
my
question,
please?
unknown
speaker
on
that
point,
we
don't
have
to
agree
with
you
on
that
position
to
affirm
the
judgment
below,
do
we?
unknown
speaker
but
let
me
get
back
to
your...
what
you
mean
by
"the
nexus
to
the
particular
act.
"
and
i
guess
i'm
going
back
to
justice
ginsburg's
hypothetical.
if
the...
if
the
jury
charge...
if
the
judge
charged
the
following,
would
it
be
legally
sufficient?
in
order
to
show
that
the
gift
was
given
for
or
because
of
an
official
act,
the
government
must
prove
that
the
gift
was
given
with
an
intent
to
influence
the
performance
of
an
official
act.
you
may...
you
need
not
necessarily,
but
you
may
find,
on
this
evidence,
that
the
gift
was
so
given
because,
at
the
time
it
was
given,
there
were
two
matters
pending
before
the
secretary
in
which
the
donor,
sun-diamond,
had
an
interest.
one
was
the
insecticide
interest
and
the
other
was
the...
the
grants
to
subsidiaries
interest.
would
that
have
been
a
legally
sufficient
instruction?
unknown
speaker
why?
make
your
argument.
unknown
speaker
yeah.
unknown
speaker
so,
you're
saying
they
were
doing
it
anyway.
that's
your
argument.
okay.
unknown
speaker
i
understand.
