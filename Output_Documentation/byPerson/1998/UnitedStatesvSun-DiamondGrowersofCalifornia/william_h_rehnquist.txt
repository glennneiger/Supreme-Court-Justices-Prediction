rehnquist
well,
the...
the
hypothetical
that
might
distinguish
the
situation
is
where
someone
who
just
likes
to
be
around
high...
high-ranking
government
officials,
if
sun-diamond
gave
the
money
to
the
secretary
of
energy,
and...
or
gave
a
gift...
and
they
had
nothing
in
the
world
the
secretary
of
energy
could
do
to
affect
sun-diamond...
that
would
be
because
of
official
position,
but
not
because
of
acts
to
be
performed,
don't
you
think?

justice
