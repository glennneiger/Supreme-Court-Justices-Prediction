justice
antonin
scalia
this
case
comes
to
us
on
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
circuit.
the
united
states
through
an
independent
counsel
indicted
respondent
sun-diamond
growers
for
giving
gifts
to
former
secretary
of
agriculture,
michael
espy,
in
violation
of
the
illegal
gratuity
statute
18
u.s.c
section
201(c)(1)(a).
that
statute
prohibits
giving
or
receiving
gifts
"for
or
because
of
any
official
act
performed
or
to
be
performed"
by
a
public
official.
at
trial
the
jury
was
instructed
that
respondent
violated
the
statute
as
he
gave
gifts
to
espy
because
of
his
official
position.
furthermore,
the
jury
was
explicitly
told
that
the
government
need
not
prove
a
link
between
the
gifts
and
any
particular
official
act.
the
court
of
appeals
reversed
this
conviction
and
remanded
for
a
new
trial.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
we
affirm.
the
illegal
gratuity
statute
section
201(c)
is
part
of
that
section
the
united
states
code
that
also
contains
the
bribery
statute
section
201(b).
the
latter
requires
proof
that
something
of
value
was
given
or
received
"to
influence"
any
official
act.
it
requires
a
quid
pro
quo,
the
act
in
exchange
for
the
gift.
the
illegal
gratuity
statute
before
us
here
on
the
other
hand
requires
a
showing
only
that
something
of
value
was
given
for
or
because
of
any
official
act.
it
does
not
require
a
quid
pro
quo,
but
prohibits
rewards
for
acts
already
taken
or
for
future
acts
which
an
official
has
already
committed
to
take.
both
statutes
however
require
a
connection
between
the
gift
and
an
official
act.
the
language
that
section
201(c)
uses
for
or
because
of
any
official
act
is
certainly
susceptible
of
the
indeterminate
meaning
urged
here
by
the
independent
counsel
and
by
justice
department
as
amicus.
so
that
it
would
apply
to
a
gift
given
for
any
unspecified
official
act,
or
more
generally
because
of
the
recipient's
official
position.
one
can
ask,
for
example,
do
you
like
any
composer?
meaning,
do
you
like
all
composers,
no
matter
what
their
identity,
or
one
can
ask
do
you
like
any
composer?
meaning,
do
you
like
any
particular
composer?
the
latter
more
specifying
meaning
of
any
seems
to
us
the
more
normal
one.
moreover,
the
consequences
of
the
government's
interpretation
are
quite
extreme.
it
would
criminalize,
for
example,
a
high
school
principal's
gift
of
a
school
baseball
cap
to
the
secretary
of
education
by
reason
of
his
office
on
the
occasion
of
the
latter's
visit
to
the
school.
when
congress
has
wanted
to
adopt
such
a
broad
prohibition
on
gift
giving
it
has
done
so
explicitly.
for
example,
other
provisions
of
chapter
11
of
title
18,
the
chapter
entitled
bribery
graft
and
conflicts
of
interest,
make
it
a
crime
to
give
or
receive
any
supplementation
of
an
executive
official's
salary
without
regard
to
the
purpose
of
the
payment,
or
for
a
bank
employee
to
give
a
bank
examiner,
or
for
a
bank
examiner
to
receive
from
a
bank
employee
any
longer
gratuity
without
regard
to
the
purpose.
these
provisions
make
their
broad
and
categorical
suite
quite
clear.
we
think
it
unlikely
that
the
phrase
for
or
because
of
any
official
act
was
meant
to
achieve
the
same
goal.
finally,
and
perhaps
most
important,
a
narrow
rather
than
a
sweeping
prohibition
is
more
compatible
with
the
fact
that
section
201(c)(1)(a)
is
merely
one
strand
of
an
intricate
web
of
regulations;
both
administrative
and
criminal,
governing
the
acceptance
of
gifts
and
other
self
enriching
actions
by
public
officials.
various
provisions
of
the
united
states
court,
for
example,
make
it
a
crime
to
give
or
receive
compensation
in
consideration
for
a
federal
employee's
representational
assistance
to
any
one
involved
in
the
proceeding
in
which
the
united
states
has
a
direct
and
substantial
interest.
or
a
federal
employee
to
act
as
agent
or
attorney
for
any
one
appearing
before
virtually
any
government
tribunal
in
connection
with
the
matter
in
which
the
united
states
has
a
direct
and
substantial
interest.
or
various
types
of
federal
employees
to
engage
in
various
activities
after
completion
of
their
federal
service,
etcetera.
the
criminal
statutes
are
just
the
tip
of
the
iceberg.
each
branch
of
the
federal
government
has
detailed
rules
and
regulations
governing
its
employees'
receipts
of
gratuities.
all
of
these
regulations
and
some
of
the
statutes
contain
exceptions
for
various
kinds
of
gratuities
given
by
various
donors
for
various
purposes.
many
of
those
exceptions
would
be
snares
for
the
unwary,
given
that
there
are
no
exceptions
to
the
broad
prohibitions
that
the
government
claims
is
imposed
by
section
201(c)(1)(a).
this
is
in
short
an
area
where
precisely
targeted
prohibitions
are
common
place,
and
where
more
general
prohibitions
are
qualified
by
numerous
exceptions.
given
that
reality,
a
statute
in
this
field
that
can
linguistically
be
interpreted
to
be
either
a
meat
axe
or
a
scalpel
should
reasonably
be
taken
to
be
the
latter.
absent
the
text
that
clearly
requires
it,
we
ought
not
to
expand
this
one
piece
of
the
regulatory
puzzle
so
dramatically
as
to
make
many
other
pieces
misfits.
thus,
the
district
court's
instructions
in
this
case
were
erroneous.
they
allowed
the
jury
to
convict
on
a
showing
that
gifts
were
motivated
by
secretary
espy's
capacity
to
act
in
any
unspecified
matters
affecting
respondent.
the
jury
did
not
have
to
find
a
connection
between
any
particular
gift
and
any
particular
official
act,
which
is
what
the
law
requires.
that
error,
moreover,
was
not
harmless.
accordingly,
we
affirm
the
dc
circuit's
decision,
remanding
the
case
for
a
new
trial.
the
decision
of
the
court
is
unanimous.
