mr.
robert
w.
ray
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
respondent,
sun-diamond
growers,
was
extensively
regulated
by
the
united
states
department
of
agriculture.
in
the
first
14
months
of
secretary
of
agriculture
mike
espy's
tenure,
sun-diamond
lavished
on
its
chief
regulator
thousands
of
dollars
in
gifts,
while
it
had
millions
of
dollars
at
stake
in
usda
programs.
the
jury
convicted
respondent
of
giving
unlawful
gratuities
under
section
201(c)
by
finding
that
sun-diamond
gave
the
gratuities
for
or
because
of
the
secretary's
official
position.
under
the
plain
language
of
the
statute,
an
official
act...
section
201(a)(3)...
means
any
decision
or
action
on
any
matter
which
may
be
pending
before
the
public
official
in
his
official
capacity.
here,
the
statute
reaches
$6,000
in
gifts
given
by
a
regulated
entity
for
or
because
of
the
official's
position,
his
capacity
to
act,
on
matters
pending
or
on
matters
which
could
be
brought
before
usda.
the
district
court--
mr.
robert
w.
ray
--justice
o'connor--
mr.
robert
w.
ray
--justice
o'connor,
you
are
correct.
the
element
is
for
or
because
of
an
official
act.
that
element
was
provided
by
the
district
judge
to
the
jury
in
this
case.
the
issue,
however,
is
whether
or
not
the
district
judge's
explanation
of
what
would
be
sufficient
proof
of
the
requisite
motivation
was
satisfied
by
a
jury
finding
that
the
motivation
behind
the
gift
was
for
or
because
of
the
official's
position.
in
this
case,
involving
a
regulated
entity,
our
position
is
that
the
position
of
the
official
is
coextensive
with
his
capacity
to
act
on
any
number
of
acts
coming
before
him.
mr.
robert
w.
ray
only,
your
honor...
and
that
was
why
we
answered
the
question
presented
by
the
court
in...
in
a
qualified
way:
only
when
it
is
the
official's
position,
understood
as
the
capacity
to
act,
do
we
believe
that
there
is
an
equivalence,
that
they
are
coextensive
with
one
another.
mr.
robert
w.
ray
no,
justice
souter,
for
the
following
reason.
the
link
that
your
honor
is
referring
to
is
a
link
that
came
during
the
portion
of
the
instruction
where
the
judge
was
making
clear
to
the
jury
that
this
was
not
a
bribery
offense.
the
link
being--
mr.
robert
w.
ray
--your
honor,
but
it
was
in
the
portion
of
the
charge
where
the
judge
was
trying
to
explain
to
the
jury
that
no
such
link
was
required.
that
is,
that
the
jury
did
not
have
to
find
that
there
was
a
particular
official
act
or
a
matter
in
mind
at
the
time
of
the
gift.
mr.
robert
w.
ray
your
honor,
our...
our
position--
mr.
robert
w.
ray
--our
position
is
that
if
it
is
the
prospect
of
official
conduct
that
motivates
the
gift,
it's
enough
to
find
that
to
satisfy
this
offense.
to
hold
otherwise...
that
is,
to
distinguish
between
gifts
given
for
official
acts
in
general--
mr.
robert
w.
ray
--let
me
answer
the
"why"
question
first.
the
"why"
question
is
that
it
shouldn't
be
any
less
offensive
to
integrity
in
government
that
gratuities
were
given
with
a
particular
matter
in
mind,
a
whole
multitude
of
matters
in
mind,
or
no
specific
or
any
official
act
in
mind
at
the
time
of
the
gift,
as
long
as
there
is
sufficient
proof
of
motivation
of
the
prospect
of
official
action;
in
other
words,
the
prospect
of
official
conduct.
to
answer
your
hypothetical,
in
that
hypothetical
circumstance,
it
is
our
position
that
our
logic...
the
logic
to
the
"for
or
because
of"
official
position
argument
would
be
sufficient
to
encompass
your
hypothetical
if
the
motivation
behind
that
gift
was
the
senior
citizen
offering
a
gift
to
a
public
official,
in...
in
that
circumstance,
because
of
the
official's
position
or,
indeed,
because
of
official
action...
action
with
respect
to
legislation
that
was
of
interest
to
that
senior
citizen.
mr.
robert
w.
ray
it
is
not,
justice
scalia.
because
that--
mr.
robert
w.
ray
--the
difference
under
7353
(a)
is
that
the
statute
is
simply
asking
there,
as
a
fact,
whether
or
not
those
interests
were
ones
before
the
public
official.
it
is
not
asking
what
the
motivation
was
behind
the
gift.
our...
our
position
absolutely
depends--
mr.
robert
w.
ray
--no,
your
honor.
the
federal
gratuities
statute
requires
proof
of
intent,
criminal
intent,
a
motivation,
the
motivation
for
or
because
of
official
position
or
for
or
because
of
official
acts,
the
prospect
of
official
conduct.
7353
(a),
first
of
all,
only
applies--
mr.
robert
w.
ray
--to
the
employee.
so,
it
does
not...
it
would
not
encompass
sun-diamond's
conduct
in
this
case,
clearly.
but,
even
apart
from
that,
it
doesn't
require
any
proof
of
intent.
it
simply
says:
if
you
shall
solicit
or
accept
anything
of
value
from
a
person--
mr.
robert
w.
ray
--whose
interests
may
be
substantially
affected.
that
is
what
is
encompassed
by
that
provision.
mr.
robert
w.
ray
your
honor--
mr.
robert
w.
ray
--your
honor,
we
believe
it
does
make
some
sense.
first
of
all,
there
is,
necessarily,
some
overlap
from
what
7353
invites,
which
is
the
passage
of
regulations
that
deal
in
an
administrative
matter
with
conduct
of
federal
employees.
and
clearly
there
may
be
circumstances
where
the
conduct
of
a
federal
employee
would
violate
a
regulation,
leading
to
dismissal
or
other
sanction,
and
also...
might
also,
on
the
same
conduct,
include
criminal
prosecution.
mr.
robert
w.
ray
your
honor,
this
statute,
5
u.s.c.,
7353,
first
of
all,
does
not
do
anything
other
than
authorize
the
enactment
or
passage
of
federal
regulations
to
deal
with
its...
its
general
conduct.
but,
again,
to
return
to
the
answer
to
your
question,
why
this
is
different
than
section
201,
it
is
significantly
different
because
there
is
no
criminal
intent;
there
is
no
knowledge
requirement
in
this
proscription,
7353.
which
is...
we
believe,
is
the
substantial
difference
between
what
congress
had
in
mind
in
1962,
when
it
passed
18
u.s.c.,
section
201(c),
which
covers
the
situation
of
a
gratuities
offense.
mr.
robert
w.
ray
it
does
not,
your
honor.
it
is
limited
by
its
express
terms
to
gifts
to
federal
employees,
covering
only
federal
employees.
mr.
robert
w.
ray
your
honor,
justice
kennedy,
we...
we--
mr.
robert
w.
ray
--your
honor,
the
only
safe
harbor
that
is
apparent
with
respect
to
prosecution
under
the
federal
gratuity
statute,
under
our
theory,
again,
is
this
question
of
whether
or
not
there's
a
gift
given
to
a
public
official
solely
because
of
that
public
official's
status,
completely
untethered
from
official
acts.
in
other
words,
the
department
of
justice's
hypothetical,
which
deals
with
the...
the
general
question
of
a
status
gift,
unconnected
to
the
capacity
for
official
action.
mr.
robert
w.
ray
that's
different--
mr.
robert
w.
ray
--correct,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
w.
ray
justice
breyer,
but
that's
not
what
congress
intended.
and
it
became
apparent
in
1989,
with
the
passage
of
5
u.s.c.,
7353.
at
the
time
the
congress
passed
this
statute,
it
recognized
the
department
of
justice's
broad
sweep
in
interpretation
to
the
201
gratuity
statute,
consistent
with
the
intent
of
congress,
going
back
to
the
beginning,
which
was
when
it
was
passed
in
1962.
it
recognized
that
there
was
in
fact
overlap
between
the
scheme
that
it
was
going
to
further,
post-1989,
in
connection
with
federal
regulations
that
would
be
applicable
to
all
federal
employees.
it
recognized,
further,
that
the
intent,
sufficient
to
satisfy
a
201
(c)
offense,
was
motivated
for
or
because
of
an
official's
position.
that
was
the
sweep--
mr.
robert
w.
ray
--justice
ginsburg,
it
was.
but
it...
it
included,
as
part
of
that
charge,
both
requests
by
the
government,
as
well
as
requests
by
the
defendant.
mr.
robert
w.
ray
correct,
your
honor,
the
part
that
you
just
read,
yes.
mr.
robert
w.
ray
by
the
government.
and
with
respect
to
that
portion
of
the
charge,
the
reason
the
government
included
it,
your
honor,
is
because
intent
to
influence
is
not
an
element
of
a
bribery...
of
a
gratuity
offense.
it
is,
by
contrast,
an
element
of
a
bribery
offense,
which
is
section
201
(b).
we
believe
the--
mr.
robert
w.
ray
--that's
correct,
we
could
have
done
that.
and
the
district
court
certainly
could
have
instructed
in
that
fashion.
we're...
we're
here
simply
to
say,
your
honor,
that
a...
an
additional
requirement
which,
if
you
instruct
in
a
fashion
such
as
official
acts,
begs
the
question
about
whether
or
not
you're
requiring,
for
example,
a
specific
official
act
to
be
shown.
we
believe
no
such
requirement
exists
in
the
federal
gratuities
statute.
mr.
robert
w.
ray
you
are
correct,
mr.
chief
justice.
that's
right.
and
it
could
have
been...
we...
the
government
could
have
talked
in
terms,
and
the
district
judge
could
have
talked
in
terms
of
acts
rather
than
position.
mr.
robert
w.
ray
you
are
correct,
your
honor,
it
is
not
within
the
language
of
the
statute.
it
is
not
our
position
or
the
department
of
justice's
position
that
that
would
be
included
under
our
theory
of
the
case
under
"for
or
because
of
official
position.
"
that,
however,
was
not
presented
by
the
facts
of
this
case.
and
it
was
not
left
to
the
jury
to
simply
speculate
about
what
type
of
official
action
they
were
to
be
concerned
about.
in
this
case,
the
judge
further
instructed
the
jury
that
the
jury
had
to
find
official
acts...
the
portion
of
the
charge
which
is
in
the
appendix,
at
page
88,
said:
with
respect
to
official
acts...
i'm
reading
from
the
second
full
paragraph...
the
government
has
to
prove
that
sun-diamond
growers
gave
knowingly
and
willingly
secretary
espy
things
of
value
while
it
had
issues
before
the
united
states
department
of
agriculture.
i
mean,
our
position
is
that,
ultimately,
what
the
gratuity
statute
is
about
is
the
prospect
of
official
action...
in
justice
ginsburg's
hypothetical...
ultimately,
the
prospect
of...
of
intending
to
have
some
influence
on
official
action.
the
issue
in
this
case
is
what
is
the
element
of
the
offense
that
congress
required?
mr.
robert
w.
ray
and
our
difficulty
with
that,
your
honor,
to
answer
your
question,
is
that
the
element
of
the
offense,
intent
to
influence,
is
a
bribery
concept.
much
of
what
a
district
judge
does...
and
this
has
been
proven
by
experience
since
this...
this
statute
has
been
enacted
in
1962...
is
a...
a
large
effort
to
make
sure
that
the
jury
understands
the
difference
between
a
bribery
offense
and
a
gratuities
offense.
a
bribery
offense
has
essentially
three
important
components
different
than
a
gratuity
offense.
one
of
them
is
an...
an
intent
to
influence.
another
is
a
corrupt
intent.
the
third
is
a
quid
pro
quo
or
an
agreement.
mr.
robert
w.
ray
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
w.
ray
we
believe
judge
wald
correctly
recognized
the
point,
that
inherent
in
a
gift
given
in
a
regulated
context
is
ultimately
the
prospect
of
official
action.
and
to
talk...
to
start
to
talk
about
intent
to
influence
as
an...
as
a
required
element
of
the
offense
we
believe
leads
the
jury
astray.
mr.
robert
w.
ray
i
would
think
that
would
be
as
misleading
as...
as
instructing
with
intent
to
influence.
we
have
to
be
careful
about,
obviously,
how
to
instruct
a
jury.
mr.
robert
w.
ray
with
respect
to
a...
sort
of
a
generalized
intent?
mr.
robert
w.
ray
i
think
wherever
you
talk
about...
and
a
generalized
intent
to
influence
seems
to
me
to
be
no
different
than
saying
you're
going
to
require
some
sort
of
a
specific
intent
to
influence.
mr.
robert
w.
ray
we
believe
the...
the
instruction,
read
as
a
whole,
in
its
entirety--
mr.
robert
w.
ray
--oh,
your
hypothetical.
mr.
robert
w.
ray
in
isolation,
i
mean,
i...
i
think,
in
isolation,
it's
not
wrong.
we
think
it
would
require
some
further
explanation
to
be
clear
about
what
is
meant.
i
mean,
certainly
you
can
envision
other
ways
to
explain
this
to
a
jury.
mr.
robert
w.
ray
that's
half
of
it,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
w.
ray
that's
correct,
justice
scalia.
and
that
would--
mr.
robert
w.
ray
--that's
correct.
and
the...
and
the
reason--
mr.
robert
w.
ray
--that's
only
half
of
the
statute.
the
statute
also
deals
with
prospective
activity,
to
be
performed.
your
hypothetical
deals
simply
with
the
first
half,
which
is
what
has
already
been
performed,
the
reward
for
past
official
action.
and--
mr.
robert
w.
ray
--justice
kennedy,
that's
three--
mr.
robert
w.
ray
--it
does,
your
honor.
and
our
position
is
that's
three-quarters
of
the
way
there.
mr.
robert
w.
ray
yes.
mr.
robert
w.
ray
that's
correct.
and
that
would
get
us
even
further
the
way
there,
but
not
all
of
the
way
there.
mr.
robert
w.
ray
where
we're
lacking--
[laughter]
we'll
get
there
eventually.
mr.
chief
justice,
where
we're
lacking
is,
again,
the
prospect
of
future
conduct,
where
it
is
not
speculative,
but
there's
a
likelihood
that
it
will
be
there.
clearly
presented
by
the
facts
of
this
case,
absolutely
no
question,
in
a
regulated
context,
where
sun-diamond
is
a
large
agricultural
cooperate...
cooperative,
regulated
on
a
day-to-day
basis
by
the
secretary
of
agriculture,
in
a
situation
where
the
jury
is
also
required
to
find
that
there
were
matters
pending
before
the
department
of
agriculture
of
interest
to
sun-diamond,
that
it
is
sufficient,
under
the
statute,
to
embrace
and
encompass
within
its
scope
the
prospect
of
official
actions
by
that
official.
mr.
robert
w.
ray
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
w.
ray
yes.
mr.
robert
w.
ray
we
believe
that
the
positions
are
the
same.
both
deal
with
the
question
of
whether
or
not
"for
or
because
of
official
position.
"
is
sufficient
to
satisfy
the
statute.
the
department
of
justice
explains
that
that's
an
appropriate
shorthand,
a
shorthand
used
by
the
fifth
circuit
in
evans
and
bustamante
and
by
the
third
circuit
in
standefer
for
a
showing
for
or
because
of
official
acts
so
long
as
official
position
is
understood
to
mean
the
prospect
of
official
action,
the
capacity
to
act,
consistent
with
the
definition
under
201(a)(3).
as
long
as
it
is
properly
understood,
our
position
and
the
department
of
justice's
position
is
the
same.
we
don't
believe
there's
any
discrepancy.
your
honor's
question
goes
toward,
ultimately,
whether
or
not
this
was
a
properly
instructed
jury.
we
believe
that
it
was.
if
there
was
any
error
in
the
instruction,
we
believe
that
it
was
harmless
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
and
that
the
jury's
verdict
should
be
reinstated.
that's
our
position.
also,
every--
mr.
robert
w.
ray
--ultimately,
we
believe
the
positions
are
the
same,
yes,
your
honor.
it
is
the
capacity
to
act.
mr.
robert
w.
ray
well,
i
wouldn't
go
that
far.
[laughter]
mr.
robert
w.
ray
obviously,
we
have
an
interest
in
defending
the
instruction
that
was
given
by
the
district
court
in
this
case.
that
is
not
a
position
that
the
solicitor
general
rendered
any
opinion
on,
for
obvious
reasons.
i
mean,
every
lawsuit
is
a...
a
dispute
between
the
parties.
we
believe,
in
this
lawsuit--
mr.
robert
w.
ray
--i'm
sorry?
mr.
robert
w.
ray
well,
we
have
an
interest
in
defending
the...
the...
the
instruction
and
the
jury's
verdict.
the
department
of
justice's
position
in
this
case
as
an
amicus
is
in
making
sure
there's
a
proper
understanding
and
interpretation
of
the
language
of
the
federal
gratuity
statute.
so,
in
that
sense,
they
are
different.
mr.
robert
w.
ray
we
don't
believe--
mr.
robert
w.
ray
--we
don't
believe
there's
a
sufficient
showing
of
motivation,
based
on
the
facts.
mr.
robert
w.
ray
if
it's
completely
untethered
to
the
prospect
of
official
action,
that
would
not
be
a
sufficient
showing.
mr.
robert
w.
ray
on
those
facts
as
you've
just
added
them,
that
would
appear
to
suggest
a
motivation
involving
some
capacity
to
act.
mr.
robert
w.
ray
there
would
have
to
be
additional
facts
that
were
not
present
in
your
hypothetical
that
were
present
here.
did
they
have
any
matters
before
that
official?
mr.
robert
w.
ray
and...
and
under
those
circumstances,
if
that
motivation
were
shown
that
it
was
for
or
because
of
that
position,
we
believe
that
would
be
within
the
four
corners
of
this
statute,
yes.
mr.
robert
w.
ray
well,
unless...
remember
that
there
were
also
defenses
presented
in
this
case.
in
this
particular
case,
as
in
your
case
potentially,
the
defense
of
friendship
might
apply,
social
purpose,
or
other
innocent
reason.
mr.
robert
w.
ray
and...
and
that...
if
those
defenses
were
shown,
then
that
would
be
sufficient...
if
that
was
the
motivation
for
the
gift,
to
defeat
liability.
mr.
robert
w.
ray
well,
public
officials--
mr.
robert
w.
ray
--your
honor,
we
don't
think
so.
because
already
there's
a
scheme
in
place,
under
the
federal
regulations,
that
deal
with
precisely
the
issue
that
you
describe.
public
officials
are
already
on
notice
about--
mr.
robert
w.
ray
--your
honor,
i
see
that
my
time
has
expired.
may
i
respond?
mr.
robert
w.
ray
we're
not
saying
that
we're
trying
to
bar
access.
there's
no
question
that
farmers
have
a
right
to
appear
before
these
individuals,
these
officials,
and...
and
advance
their
position.
the
question
is
buying
access.
i
mean,
the
official
can
appear
as
long
as
the
official
pays
his
own
way.
the
problem
is
when
the
official
is
in
a
relationship
with
someone
who
prospectively
has
action
before
them
and
takes
these
gifts
and
takes
them
on
the
nickel
of
the...
the
person
who
has
an
interest.
mr.
robert
w.
ray
thank
you,
your
honor.
