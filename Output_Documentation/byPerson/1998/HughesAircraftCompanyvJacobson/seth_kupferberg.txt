mr.
seth
kupferberg
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court--
the
nub
of
this
case,
as
mr.
cappuccio
put
it,
is
hughes'
use
of
the
billion
dollar
surplus
in
the
contributory
plan,
which
was
funded
in
very
large
part
by
the
contributions
of
the
employee
participants,
in
order
to
pay
hughes'
separate
obligations
to
a
new
plan
as
it
initially
announced
that
it
was
establishing
for
a
virtually
completely
different
group
of
employees
without
hardly
any
overlap,
paying
completely
different
benefits.
mr.
cappuccio
in
his
remarks
this
morning
again
referred
to
it
as
two
plans,
hughes'
announcement
referred
to
it
as
two
plans,
and
announced
that
a
new
noncontributory
plan
would
be
funded
entirely
by
hughes.
there
was
nothing
wrong
with
creating
a
new
noncontributory
plan
for
new
employees
and
nonparticipants
in
the
old
contributory
plan,
but
that
was
a
separate
plan,
as
hughes
itself
said,
to
be
funded
by
hughes,
and
not
to
be
funded
out
of
contributory
plan
assets.
mr.
seth
kupferberg
well,
they
said
that
in
their
brief,
but
contrary
to
what
was
argued
this
morning,
i
don't
believe
that
there's
any
regulation
that
says
that.
on
the
contrary,
the
treasury
regulation
to
which
ms.
blatt
referred
is
a
regulation
that
by
its
own
terms...
it
can
be
found
on
page
128a
of
the
petition
for
cert...
by
its
own
terms
it
refers
solely
in
the
context
of
a
merger
of
two
plans.
indeed,
it
says
specifically
that
it
does
not
apply
unless
more
than
a
single
plan
is
involved.
mr.
seth
kupferberg
it
is
certainly
of
great
significance
to
this
case
and,
indeed,
while
mr.
cappuccio--
mr.
seth
kupferberg
--the
legal
test
is...
it's
a
common
sense
test.
the
plan
is
not
a
define...
the
definition
in
erisa
is
a
circular
definition.
it
says
a
plan
is
either
a
welfare
plan
or
a
pension
plan.
beyond
that
there
is
no
definition.
it
is
essentially
a
common
sense
test,
and
all
the
circuits--
mr.
seth
kupferberg
--the
criteria
that
has
been
recognized
for...
to
determine
whether
a
plan
exists
by
virtually
all
the
circuits,
beginning
with
the
donovan
v.
dillingham
decision
of
the
eleventh
circuit,
are...
look
at
what
the
benefits
are,
look
at
who
the
participants
are,
look
at
the
funding
source,
look
at
the
mechanism
for
paying
benefits.
mr.
seth
kupferberg
if
those
are
completely
different,
we
would
contend
that
there
are
obviously
two
plans.
mr.
seth
kupferberg
it
is
a
determination
that
must
be
made
in
every
case.
in
this
case--
mr.
seth
kupferberg
--i'm
not
sure
what
you
mean
by
after
the
fact,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
seth
kupferberg
yes.
mr.
seth
kupferberg
you
can
tell...
you
can
tell
right
from
the
terms
of
these
two
plans
that
none
of
these
four
variables
are
the
same.
mr.
seth
kupferberg
the
noncontributory
plan--
mr.
seth
kupferberg
--yes,
sure.
mr.
seth
kupferberg
yes.
mr.
seth
kupferberg
there
can
be
multiple
benefit
structures
in
one
plan,
but
those
are...
normally
all
the
participants
are
free
to
choose
which
benefit
structure
they
wish
to
take
advantage
of.
here,
what
hughes
did
was
to
close
participation
in
the
contributory
plan,
say
nobody
can
join
after
december
1991,
and
we
will
take
the
billion
dollar
surplus
generated
from
the
participant
contributions
and
use
it
to
pay
the
benefits
of
what
is
defined
in
the
new
plan...
the
new
nonparticipatory--
mr.
seth
kupferberg
--plan
by
its
own
terms
defines
participants
as
all
those
except
those
in
the
contributory--
mr.
seth
kupferberg
--if
it
was
entirely
funded
by
the
employer,
i
think
that--
mr.
seth
kupferberg
--that
would
be
one
plan,
or
at
least--
mr.
seth
kupferberg
--if
it's
entirely
funded
by
employee
contributions,
we
would
contend
that
the
anti
inurement
provision
of
erisa,
section
403,
which
says
that
the
assets
of
a
plan
shall
never
inure
to
the
benefit
of
the
employer,
and
that
even
on
plan
termination
those
assets
must
be
distributed
if
there
is
a
surplus
to
the
employees
who
contributed
for
them,
would
prevent
the
employer
from
taking
the
money,
paid
in
by
one
group
of--
mr.
seth
kupferberg
--i
think
that
certainly
on
a
motion
to
dismiss,
which
this
was,
it
would
be
two
plans--
mr.
seth
kupferberg
--if
it's
a
factual
question--
mr.
seth
kupferberg
--i
think
on
those
facts
it
would
be
two
plans.
our
facts
are
much
clearer
than--
mr.
seth
kupferberg
--differing
sets
of
benefits
and
different
participants,
yes.
mr.
seth
kupferberg
yes.
mr.
seth
kupferberg
yes.
mr.
seth
kupferberg
that's
correct,
justice
breyer,
but...
but--
mr.
seth
kupferberg
--well--
mr.
seth
kupferberg
--for
purposes
of
this
section
that
is
the
definition.
mr.
seth
kupferberg
for
purposes
of
that
section,
yes.
mr.
seth
kupferberg
not
for
purposes
of
this
case.
mr.
seth
kupferberg
for
this
case.
mr.
seth
kupferberg
because
that
regulation
says,
for
purposes
of
this
section,
which
deals
solely
with
mergers
of
plans.
mr.
seth
kupferberg
there
was
no
contention
in
this
case
that
there
was
a
merger
of
a
plan.
mr.
seth
kupferberg
okay.
mr.
seth
kupferberg
hughes
is
using
them
for
that
purpose--
mr.
seth
kupferberg
--no.
we
say
that
they
are
not
available--
mr.
seth
kupferberg
--we
say--
mr.
seth
kupferberg
--that
is
correct.
mr.
seth
kupferberg
i--
mr.
seth
kupferberg
--section
6.5
of
the
contributory
plan
said
that
there
shall
never
be
an
amendment
under
which
assets
of
the
plan
are
used
for
any
purpose,
other
than
to
pay
benefits
to
participants
in
this
plan.
that
contributory
plan
also
defines
participants--
mr.
seth
kupferberg
--justice
breyer,
i'm
not
sure
i
understand
the
question.
mr.
seth
kupferberg
yes.
mr.
seth
kupferberg
right.
mr.
seth
kupferberg
that
sentence--
mr.
seth
kupferberg
--that
sentence
would
be
satisfied
if
there
had
been
a
merger
here,
but
that
definition
applies
only--
mr.
seth
kupferberg
--i'm
sorry,
justice
breyer.
i'm--
mr.
seth
kupferberg
--on
the--
mr.
seth
kupferberg
--the
complaint
alleges
that
hughes
created
a
new
noncontributory
plan
and
is
improperly
using
surplus
assets
of
the
contributory
plan
to
fund
benefits
of
participants
in
the
new
noncontributory
plan.
that's
on...
in
the
joint
appendix
on
page
26.
it's
paragraphs
27
and
30
of
the
complaint.
the
nub
of
the
complaint
here
is
that
hughes
created
a
new
noncontributory
plan,
announced
that
it
would
be
funded
by
hughes
and
then,
instead
of
doing
that,
took
money
out
of
the
contributory
plan,
which
under
section
403,
the
anti
inurement
provision
of
erisa,
must
be
used
solely
for
the
purpose
of
paying
benefits
to
participants
in
the
contributory
plan,
and
is
using
it
to
pay
a
separate
obligation
to
nonparticipants
in
the
plan.
mr.
seth
kupferberg
yes.
mr.
seth
kupferberg
even
if
that
had
all
been
said
at
the
outset,
justice
ginsburg,
we
believe
it
would
have
been
prohibited
by
the
anti
inurement
clause,
which
both
mr.
cappuccio
today
and
the
solicitor
general
in
its
brief
acknowledge
is
a
substantive
provision
of
erisa,
but
in
this
case,
in
fact,
the
contributory
plan
said
just
the
opposite.
section
6.5
of
the
contributory
plan
said
that
hughes
has
the
right
to
amend
the
plan
provided,
however,
that
there
shall
never
be
an
amendment
under
which
assets
of
the
plan
are
used
for
any
purpose
other
than
paying
benefits
to
participants
in
this
plan
as
defined
in
this
plan,
and
the
plan,
the
contributory
plan
defined
participants
as
those
paying
contributions.
the
participants
in
the
new
noncontributory
plan
are
completely
different
people,
and--
mr.
seth
kupferberg
--right.
mr.
seth
kupferberg
my
answer,
justice
ginsburg,
is,
even
if
the
plan
had
said
that,
we
would
still
see
a
violation
of
section
403,
because
an
amendment
cannot...
or
an
original
plan
cannot
be
in
contravention
of
any
provision
of
erisa,
including
the
anti
inurement
clause,
which
protects--
mr.
seth
kupferberg
--well,
it
would
be
being
used
for...
in
your
hypothetical,
i
think
only
for
people
who
were
hired
after
a
certain
date,
or...
unless
participation
in
both,
what
would
then
genuinely
be
too
benefit
structures,
if
participation
in
both
benefit
structures
remained
open
to
everybody,
that
might
be
a
different
question,
but
i'm
not
sure
if
you
were--
mr.
seth
kupferberg
--because
under
erisa,
under
this
court's
decision
in
lockheed,
it's
proper
for
a
plan
to
pay
benefits
to
participants
in
that
plan.
that
is
not
a
violation
of
erisa.
but
to
take
money
from
the
plan
for
a
separate--
mr.
seth
kupferberg
--much
of
the
argument
does
hinge
on--
mr.
seth
kupferberg
--our
adversary's
argument
depends
on
the
proposition
that
there
is
just
one
plan.
over
and
over
i
counted
14
times
in
their
brief
they
said,
it's
proper
for
us
to
pay
a
new
benefit
to
participants
in
the
plan.
our
contention
here
is
that
this
is
not
participants
in
the
plan.
this
is
no
different
from
if
hughes
used--
mr.
seth
kupferberg
--if--
mr.
seth
kupferberg
--we
think
there
could
be
a
potential
anti
inurement
claim
if
the
reversionary
interest
of
employees
even
in
one
plan
was
completely
wiped
out,
but
the
case
is
much
clearer
in
that
there
are,
we
believe,
clearly
two
plans.
mr.
seth
kupferberg
sec--
mr.
seth
kupferberg
--yes.
sec...
erisa
does
not
solely
protect
defined
benefits.
that's
obviously
one
important
purpose
of
erisa,
but
erisa
had
other
purposes
as
well.
one
of
them,
which
is
recognized
in
section
403,
the
anti
inurement
clause,
and
in
section
1344,
is
that
employees
who
contribute
to
a
plan
in
addition
to
their
right
to
the
defined
benefit
have
a
reversionary
interest
if
the
plan
ever
terminates
in
the
surplus
that
was
generated
by
their
contributions.
when
erisa
was
passed,
one
of
the
abuses
that
was
on
congress'
mind--
mr.
seth
kupferberg
--in
erisa?
it's
contained
in
section
403,
which
refers
as
an
exception
to
section
1344.
the...
section
1344
is
part
of
title
iv,
dealing
with
termination
provisions,
with
termination
of
plans.
when
erisa
was
passed--
mr.
seth
kupferberg
--what
creates
the
reversionary
interest
is
section
1344(d).
in
section
1103
the
anti
inurement
claims...
i'm
sorry,
the
anti
inurement
provision,
says
that
except...
with
the
following
exceptions
the
assets
of
a
plan
shall
never
inure
to
the
benefit
of
the
employer.
there
are
two
exceptions
that
are
mentioned
that
i
think
are
relevant
here.
one
is,
it
refers
to
a
transfer
of
benefits,
a
transfer
of
the
assets
under
section
420
of
the
internal
revenue
code.
mr.
seth
kupferberg
1103,
403.
mr.
seth
kupferberg
403
mentions
a
transfer
of
assets
under
section
420
of
the
internal
revenue
code.
what
that
refers
to
is
the
use
of
pension
plan
assets
to
pay
health
benefits.
the
fact
that
there's
an
exception
here
indicates
that
had
there
not
been
this
exception
payment
of
health
benefits
would
have
been
inurement
to
the
employer.
section
403
also
says
there's
another
exception,
that
inurement
to
the
employer
is
permitted
pursuant
to
section
1344,
which
refers
to
distribution
on
plan
termination,
and
under
certain
circumstances
under
1344
an
employer
on
termination
can
take
the
assets
that
were
generated
from
its
contributions.
it
can
never
take
the
assets
generated
from
the
employee
contributions.
mr.
seth
kupferberg
no,
not
every
time
that
happens.
mr.
seth
kupferberg
not
every
time
that
happens.
mr.
seth
kupferberg
we
would
say
that
if
it
could
be
alleged
and
shown
that
there
was
a
sufficiently
drastic
effect
on
the
plan
as
it
previously
existed--
mr.
seth
kupferberg
--that's
correct.
mr.
seth
kupferberg
$20
billion
probably
would
be.
mr.
seth
kupferberg
i
think
that
in
difficult
cases
there
might
be
problems
drawing
the
line.
because
there
are
clearly
two
plans
here,
i
don't--
mr.
seth
kupferberg
--this--
mr.
seth
kupferberg
--we--
mr.
seth
kupferberg
--i
think
that
with
respect,
justice
breyer,
i
think
we
can
say
there
are
two
plans
here
at
the
moment,
because
here
the
participants,
there
is
virtually
no
overlap,
the
benefits
are
totally
different,
hughes
itself
announced
that
this
was
a
new
plan
to
be
funded
entirely
by
hughes.
while
i
agree
that
there
could
be
difficult
problems
drawing
lines
in
other
cases...
and
this
is
the
same
kind
of
argument
that
is
raised
in
every
erisa
case
and
maybe
in
every
other
case.
in
the
varity
corps
case
it
was
argued
that
if
the
intentional
misrepresentations
here
are
permitted,
then
every
time
a
prediction
turns
out
to
be
false,
this
will
wind
up
in
court.
mr.
seth
kupferberg
what...
there's
nothing
wrong
with
that.
what
is
wrong
is
for
the
employer
to
take
surplus
assets
out
of
the
contributory
plan
and
use
it
to
pay
a
separate
debt
to
a
different
employee.
mr.
seth
kupferberg
i
think
a
$2
example
would
be
de
minimis.
if--
mr.
seth
kupferberg
--the
employer...
if
it's
taking
money
out
of
one
plan
to
pay
benefits
under
a
different
plan,
my
answer
would
be
the
same,
yes.
mr.
seth
kupferberg
yes.
mr.
seth
kupferberg
section
403
is
found
at
page
90a
of
the
petition
for
cert,
it
can
be
found.
mr.
seth
kupferberg
i...
it's
not
in
the
appendix.
it
is
quoted
in--
mr.
seth
kupferberg
--i
believe
the
pertinent
statutory
provisions
are
in
the
petition
for
cert.
i
don't
think
they
were
repeated
in
the
joint
appendix.
at
any
rate,
i
didn't
write
the
page
number
down.
it's
also,
i
believe,
quoted
a
number
of
times
in
the
briefs.
it
says
there--
mr.
seth
kupferberg
--it
has
much
more
absolute
language
than
drastic.
it
says,
shall
never
inure
to
the
benefit
of
the
employer.
mr.
seth
kupferberg
that's
correct--
mr.
seth
kupferberg
--and
that's
the
way
it's
defined
in
the
plan.
mr.
seth
kupferberg
is
it
defined
in
the
contributory
plan?
yes,
it
is,
your
honor.
mr.
seth
kupferberg
yes.
it's...
we
quote
it
in
our
brief
on
page--
mr.
seth
kupferberg
--it's
section
1.45
of...
i'm
sorry,
your
honor.
it's
quoted
on
pages
4
to
5
of
our
brief,
i
believe.
mr.
seth
kupferberg
of
the
red
brief,
that's
correct.
mr.
seth
kupferberg
right.
mr.
seth
kupferberg
i
think
that's
correct.
mr.
seth
kupferberg
i
think
on
both
sides
much
of
the
case
depends
on
that,
yes.
mr.
seth
kupferberg
probably
not,
certainly
not
as
clearly
as
what
we
allege
happened
here.
mr.
seth
kupferberg
because
the
employer
here
is
taking
money
out
of
the
plan--
mr.
seth
kupferberg
--yes.
mr.
seth
kupferberg
but
this
was
money
that
the
employer
had
promised
to
pay
out
of
its
own
assets.
mr.
seth

it
has
not
contributed
anything
to
either
plan
since
1986.
it
announced
in
1990
we're
creating
this
plan
to
be
funded
entirely
by
hughes.
mr.
seth
kupferberg
it
didn't
say
entirely
by
your--
mr.
seth
kupferberg
--probably
not,
however,
if
it
added
instead
of
1,000
employees
1
million
employees,
so
that
the
whole
nature
of
the
plan
was
being
changed,
possibly--
mr.
seth
kupferberg
--we
think
there's
a
fiduciary
obligation
to
consider
the
reversionary
interest
recognized
by
section
1344.
this
case
is
much
easier
than
that
hypothetical
precisely
because
hughes
is
not
simply
making
a
change
of...
in
some
minor
aspect
of
the
plan.
it
announced
that
was
creating
a
new
benefit
plan
for
different
employees
to
be
funded
by
hughes,
and
it
took
money
out
of
the
surplus
of
the
contributory
plan
paid
for
by
the
participants
in
the
contributory
plan--
mr.
seth
kupferberg
--no,
justice
ginsburg.
it's
a
defined
benefit
plan,
but
employees
have
rights
beyond
simply
getting
their
defined
benefit.
again,
when
erisa
was
passed
congress
was
concerned
not
only
that
promises
be
kept,
but
the
elgin
watch
company,
which
had
pocketed
a
surplus
that
was
paid
for
by
employees,
that
was
one
of
the
abuses
that
congress
was
concerned
with.
in
the
varity
corps
case
last
term
it
was
argued
employees
got
everything
they
were
entitled
to
under
the
terms
of
the
plan.
employees...
one
important
purpose
of
erisa
is
that
defined
benefits
be
paid,
but
it
is
also
an
important
purpose
of
erisa,
stated
in
section
403,
that
money
not
be
taken
out
of
a
plan
in
order
to
pay
an
employer's
separate
obligations,
and
that
is
exactly
what
happened
here.
hughes
took
money--
mr.
seth
kupferberg
--for
purposes
of
the
two
plan
versus
one
distinction,
that's
correct,
justice
souter.
in
conclusion,
again,
an
employer
cannot
take
money
out
of
a
plan
meant
for,
defined
as
for
one
group
of
participants,
paid
for
by
those
participants--
mr.
seth
kupferberg
--yes.
mr.
seth
kupferberg
yes.

section
403.
mr.
seth
kupferberg
the
donovan
v.
dillingham
criteria
for
when
a
plan
exists
are
common
sense
criteria.
donovan
v.--
mr.
seth
kupferberg
--right.
mr.
seth
kupferberg
the
donovan
v.
dillingham,
and
there's
a
line
of
cases
springing
from
that,
recognize
the
criteria
for
when
a
plan
exists.
if
all
those
criteria
are
different,
just
as
if
you
said
the
criteria
for
a
piece
of
music
are
harmony,
melody,
and
rhythm,
if
the
harmony
is
different,
the
melody
is
different,
and
the
rhythm
is
different,
it's
two
different
pieces
of
music,
and
potentially
if
there
was
a
question
of
degree
that
could
be
decided
by
the
fact
finder
in
a
copyright
case.
here,
this
is
a
motion
to
dismiss.
it
is
up
to
the
district
court
to
hear
and
determine
whether
there
are
two
plans,
as
we
contend,
and
we
think
the
facts
will
clearly
demonstrate
that.
the
department
of
labor
in
an
interpretive
letter,
i...
although
the
solicitor
general
obviously
has
backed
away
from
that,
itself
recognized
that
this
is
a
question
of
fact,
whether
there's
one
plan
or
two.
mr.
cappuccio
in
his
brief
says,
well,
that
was...
that's
different,
because
here
it's
all
out
of
one
funding
source.
that
was
a
welfare
plan.
welfare
plans
are
paid
out
of
corporate
assets.
there
was
one
funding
source
there.
the
plan
is
a
common
sense
term,
there's...
it's
not
a
term
of
art,
and
the
donovan
v.
dillingham
criteria
are
sensible
criteria.
if
you
apply
them
here,
it's
clear
that
there
are
two
plans,
and
hughes
is
taking
money
out
of
the
contributory
plan
that
was
generated
by
the
employees'
own
hard
earned
after
tax
money
and
is
using
that
to
pay
it's
separate
obligations
to
the
noncontributory
plan.

termination
is
not

no.
mr.
seth
kupferberg
term...
i'm
sorry,
termination
is
a
term
that
erisa
does
define.
what
we
say
on
termination
is
that
the
court
can
order
hughes
to
use
the
means
for
termination
provided
in
title
iv.
our
complaint
could
have
been
clearer
in
alleging
that.
this
complaint
was
dismissed
without
leave
to
amend.
if
there's
any
doubt
about
what
we're
saying,
although
we
think
we've
made
it
clear
in
briefs
in
the
ninth
circuit
as
well
as
here--
mr.
seth
kupferberg
--we
did
not,
because
we
believe
our...
even
the
original
complaint,
what
was
always
intended
was--
mr.
seth
kupferberg
--thank
you,
chief
justice
rehnquist.
