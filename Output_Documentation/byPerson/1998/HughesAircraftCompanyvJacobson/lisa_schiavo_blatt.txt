ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court--
i
would
first
like
to
address
the
contention
in
this
case
that
hughes
created
a
new
benefit
structure
that
constitutes
a
different
plan
under
erisa.
we
disagree
with
that
contention
for
two
reasons.
first,
as
reflected
in
a
department
of
treasury
regulation,
it
is
the
position
of
all
three
agencies
responsible
for
enforcing
and
administering
erisa
that
a
single
plan
may
contain
multiple
benefit
structures
as
long
as
all
plan
assets
are
available
to
pay
benefits
to
all
plan
participants.
that
principle
furthers
erisa's
fundamental
goal
that
there
is
a
restricted
asset
pool
that
is
sufficient
and
available
to
satisfy
the
employer's
promise
to
pay
benefits.
the
principle
also
reflects
the
employer's
general
discretion
over
plan
design
decisions.
second,
the
factual
circumstances
test
advanced
by
respondents
would
be
unworkable,
because
it
would
call
into
question
any
plan
amendment
that
either
raises
benefits
for
some
but
not
all
of
plan
participants,
or
adds
a
new
category
of
plan
participants.
i
would
also
like
to
address
the
issue
of
plan
termination.
as
participants
in
a
defined
benefit
plan,
respondents
are
entitled
to
receive
both
their
promised
and
vested
benefits,
and
there
is
no
allegation
in
this
case
that
hughes
has
deprived
any
employee
of
those
benefits.
moreover,
hughes
bears
the
entire
investment
risk
under
the
plan
and
must
comply
with
erisa's
minimum
funding
provisions.
the
security
of
respondents'
benefits
is
also
protected
by
title
iv's
insurance
program,
but
unless
and
until
the
plan
terminates
under
the
exclusive
means
of
title
iv,
erisa
does
not
grant
participants
in
a
defined
benefit
plan
a
right
to
a
distribution
of
plan
assets,
and
because
it's
clear
in
this
case
that
hughes
has
not
terminated
its
plan,
the
plan
is
ongoing--
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
--well,
we
don't
think
that
there's
any
basis
for
implying
either
the
right
or
the
remedy.
there's...
it's
also
our
position
that
even
if
there
was
such
a
basis
for
reading
this
common
law
doctrine
into
a
heavily
regulated
statute,
this
is
clearly
not
a
common
law
wasting
trust.
under
both
benefit
structures
you've
got
tens
of
thousands
of
employees
accruing
benefits,
and
that
unquestionably
furthers
the
plan's
express
purpose
to
provide
pension
benefits
to
eligible
employees
to
stimulate
their
interest
in
the
company
and
also
to
attract
them,
and
far
from...
what
termination
would
do
is
cease
those
accruals,
and
all
those
employees
would
be
without
benefits
and
future
accruals,
and
that
would
be
not
only
inconsistent
with
the
purpose
of
the
plan,
it
would
be
very
bad
for
the
purpose
of
erisa.
erisa
obviously
wants
to...
one
of
the
important
purposes
is
to
encourage
the
growth
and
maintenance
of
these
plans,
and
there
are
very,
very
specific
provisions
in
title
iv
when
a
plan
can
be
terminated,
and
the
involuntary
termination
provisions
of
section
1342
set
forth
the
criteria
for
the
government
to
come
in
and
terminate
a
plan,
and
the
whole
point
of
even
the
voluntary
termination
provisions
in
section
1341
are
to
make
it
more
difficult
for
employers
to
terminate.
either
the
plan
assets
have
to
be
sufficient
to
pay
benefits
and
all
the
plan
liabilities,
or
they
have
to
demonstrate
economic
distress
criteria,
so
it's
a
quite
comprehensive
provision
and
even
if
there
was
some...
and
there's
certainly
nothing
in
the
statute
that
says...
excuse
me.
there's
no
violation
that's
alleged
of
the
statute
that
respondents
would
be
trying
to
get
a
remedy
for,
but
even
if
assuming
they
had
an
alleged
violation,
there's
no
remedy,
and
so
we
just
don't...
and
even
if
there
was
a
remedy,
this
wouldn't
meet
the
criteria
of
a
wasting
trust.
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
not
that
comes
to
mind.
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
so
basically
our
point
is,
it's
a
good
thing
that
this
plan
is
ongoing,
and
as
long
as
it's
ongoing,
the
plan
assets
are
available
to
pay
participants,
and
if...
justice
souter,
if
i
could
just
go
back
to
one
of
your
points
on,
if
there's
been
a
transfer
here,
i
mean,
because
this
is
one
plan
there
never
was
a
transfer
of
assets.
the
assets
just
remain
available
under
the
plan,
and
the
employer
can
use
them
to
pay
benefits
and
make
amendments.
in
fact,
the
employer
could
raise
benefits
or
create
an
early
retirement
program
like
the
employer
did
in
spink
and
like
the
employer
did
here.
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
no.
the
restrictions
on
amendments
are
similar
to
what
mr.
cappuccio
said.
they
can't
throw
the
plan
into
a
significant
underfunding,
they
can't
violate
the
anti
inurement
provision,
and
then
the
key
one
that's
under
the
regulation
is,
you
have
to
have
a
single
pool
of
assets
that's
available
to
pay
all
the
benefits,
so
you
can't
set
up
segregated
asset
pools,
but
i'm
not
aware
of
any
amendment
that
attempted
to
do
that
and
call
it
one
plan.
and
that
would
be
just...
for
all,
almost
all
of
the
provisions
of
erisa,
for
minimum
funding,
for
reporting,
for
tax
qualification,
for
fiduciary
duty
provisions,
the
government
has
got
to
know
what
a
plan
is
to
have
a
starting
point
for
what
a
plan
is,
and
what
they
look
to
is
whether
there's
a...
what
the
pool
of
assets
is
and
what
the
corresponding
liabilities
are,
and
that's
the
way
the
statute's
been
administered,
and
that's
reflected
in
the
department
of
treasury's
regulation.
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
certainly
you'd
have
a
case...
if
you've
set
up
a
separate
plan
and
then
merged
them,
you
would
have
that
result.
if
there's
a
spin
off
it
gets
a
little
more
complicated,
because
there
are
provisions
in
the
tax
code
that
govern
how
that
has
to
be
done.
but
the
point
is--
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
--for
purposes
of
1058,
there...
i'm
not
sure
what
the
question
is,
but
you
first
have
to
start
out,
figure
out
what
you're
starting
with,
and
all
we
have
here
is
one
plan.
if
you
had...
it
might
be
a
different
question
if
you
had
completely
separate
plan
to
begin
with,
but
here
we
just
have
an
amendment.
there's
always
been
one
asset
pool,
and
all
that
hughes
did
was
amend
its
plan
to
make
plan
assets
available
to
pay
benefits
to
plan
participants,
so--
if
there
are
no
further
questions--
