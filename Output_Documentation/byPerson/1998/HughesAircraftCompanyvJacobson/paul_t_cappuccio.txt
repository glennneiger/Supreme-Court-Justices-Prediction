mr.
paul
t.
cappuccio
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court--
the
nub
of
this
case,
i
believe,
is
that
the
post
termination
surplus
asset
allocation
rules
buried
in
section
1344(d)
of
erisa
cannot
become
the
tail
that
wags
the
rest
of
the
statute.
those
rules
do
not
create
an
entitlement
that
restricts
the
legitimate
uses
to
which
surplus
plan
assets,
or
any
plan
assets,
can
be
put,
but
that
is
how
the
respondents
would
have
it
in
this
case.
the
respondents
do
not
contend
that
they
have
not
received
every
benefit
that
they
were
ever
promised
under
the
hughes
pension
plan.
mr.
paul
t.
cappuccio
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
paul
t.
cappuccio
that's
correct,
your
honor.
in
a
defined
benefit
plan,
the
employee
takes
no
risk
that
the
plan
will
not
perform
well.
rather,
the
employee
is
guaranteed
from
day
1,
justice
o'connor,
that
he
or
she
will
receive
fixed
benefits
that
are
at
least
equal
to
all
of
his
or
her
contributions.
mr.
paul
t.
cappuccio
there
certainly
may
well
be,
your
honor.
that's
absolutely
right.
mr.
paul
t.
cappuccio
i
think
the
theory
of
the
court
below
would
be
that
the
employer
would
have
to
make
up
the
difference,
which
is,
in
fact,
how
a
defined
benefits
plan
works,
so
i
think
what
your
question
points
out,
your
honor,
is
the
theory
of
the
court
below
in
a
sense
creates
a
defined
contribution
plan
with
a
defined
benefits
floor,
which
as
judge
easterbrook--
mr.
paul
t.
cappuccio
--i
think
they're
still
very
much
around,
your
honor.
i
think
the
general
trend
is
to
move
towards
defined
contribution
plans,
and
also
to
move
away
from
contributions
to
defined
benefit
plans,
and
i
think
the
reason
for
that
is
as
a
general
sense
today
that
employees
want
to
invest
their
own
money.
for
example,
in
this
case
hughes
has
a
401k
plan,
so
if
they're
not
contributing
they
can
take
that
extra
money
and
put
it
into
the
401k
plan,
and--
mr.
paul
t.
cappuccio
--there
is
a
provision
in
section
1054
of
erisa
that
provides
if
you
are
allowed
to
make
voluntary
contributions
over
and
above
the
mandatory
contributions,
that
you
vest
in
those
also,
but
here
the
contributions
are
mandatory.
the
mere
fact
that
at--
mr.
paul
t.
cappuccio
--i
would
disagree,
justice
kennedy.
the
mere
fact
that
on
one
day
you
have
a
choice
whether
or
not...
which
plan
to
be
in
doesn't
then
make
the
contributions
voluntary
once
you
select
that
plan.
i
mean,
it's
voluntary
only
in
the
distant
sense
that
you
could
decide
to
be
an
employee
or
not
an
employee.
that
doesn't--
mr.
paul
t.
cappuccio
--i
believe
that's
correct,
your
honor.
i
believe
it
was
a
one
time
election,
and
it
certainly--
mr.
paul
t.
cappuccio
--i'm
sorry.
i
meant
to
say
which
benefit
structure--
mr.
paul
t.
cappuccio
--let
me
take
that
one
on--
[laughter]
--directly,
and
that
is
that
it's
alleged
in
this
case
that
somehow
a
factual
issue
has
been
raised
because
one
of
our
employees
at
one
point
referred
to
this
as
the
new
plan,
okay.
people
speak
in
colloquial
terms
all
the
time,
i
think
that's
a
good
thing,
and
people
use
the
word
new
when
they
mean
amended.
i
had
that...
not
only
have
i
had
the
slip
here
at
the
podium,
justice
stevens,
but
when
i
was
preparing
for
this
case
i
wanted
to
see
what
erisa
said
before
and
after
the
1986
amendments,
and
i
said
to
my
associate,
can
you
get
me
the
statute,
and
he
said
to
me,
well,
here's
the
old
statute,
here's
the
new
statute,
and
i
said,
well,
it's
a
good
thing
we're
not
in
the
ninth
circuit.
you
would
have
just
created
a
question
of
fact.
but
i
think
the
point
is
is
that
1)
we're
not
bound
by
colloquialisms
like
that,
and
second,
people
say
new
when
they
mean
amended
all
the
time,
and
the
case
can't
turn
on
that.
mr.
paul
t.
cappuccio
no,
your
honor,
i
don't
think
the
fact
that
you
could
even...
which
is
not
this
case,
that
you
could
switch
back
and
forth,
would
make
the
contributions
any
less
mandatory.
i
would
still,
if
you're
going
to
participate
in
this
plan,
they
would
be
mandatory
contributions,
and
therefore
under
section
1053
and
1054
you
would
only
vest
in
your
contributions
plus
the
statutory
interest
rate
and
not
in
all
the
upside,
and
anything
else,
your
honor,
transforms
this
plan
and
any
other
defined
benefits
plan
into
exactly
what
justice
o'connor
pointed
to,
which
is
a
defined
benefits,
defined
contribution
floor,
a
benefits
floor
with
a
defined
contribution
upside,
and
that
really
i
think
wrecks
the
basic
dichotomy
that
is
in
the
statute.
mr.
paul
t.
cappuccio
justice
ginsburg,
i
think
it's
quite
common.
in
fact,
i
think
it's
the
usual
amendment
these
days.
i
know
in
this
case
it's
the
same
way
that
the
union
plan
went,
that
the
employer
and
the
union
in
the
bargaining
plan...
remember,
we
have
the
nonbargaining
plan
here.
in
the
other
plan,
the
union
and
the
employer
agreed
to
go
from
a
contributory
structure
to
a
noncontributory
structure,
and
again,
i
think
it's
because
it's
a
sense
by
employers
that
they
want
to
give
employees
some
choice
in
how
to
invest
their
money,
and
at
least
when
the
stock
market
was
doing
well,
that
employees
had
a
lot
of
other
options
that
they
wanted
to
avail
themselves
of.
whether
in
light
of
the
last,
you
know,
6
months,
people
are
still
going
to
be
doing
that,
is
another
question,
but
that
just
shows
you
that
there
could
have
well
been
a
downside
here.
mr.
paul
t.
cappuccio
justice
ginsburg,
there's...
certainly
to
say
that
the...
the
answer
is
yes.
the...
to
say
that
the
employer
is
not
a
fiduciary
in
amending
the
plan
is
not
to
say
that
the
employer
has
discretion
to
do
whatever
he
wants,
whatever
it
wants.
the
employer
is
still
bound
by
the
substantive
provisions
of
erisa
that
apply
whether
or
not
one
is
a
fiduciary,
which
we
would
concede
include
the
anti
inurement
provision
here,
and
also
the
vesting
and
nonforfeitures,
forfeiture
provisions
and
the
asset
distribution
provisions,
so
to
say
that
one
is
not
a
fiduciary
here
just
means
to
say
that
the
amendment
must
comply
with
the
rest
of
erisa,
but...
and
to
say
but
there's
no
broader
duty
that
exists
out
there.
and
of
course,
if
there
were
a
broader
duty
to
plan
participants
it
would
be
a
sort
of,
a
hopelessly
conflicting
situation,
right,
because
the
employer
would
be
under
conflicting
fiduciary
duties.
when
we're
deciding
how
to
structure
the
benefit
program
for
active
employees
and
retired
employees,
to
whom
do
we
owe
the
fiduciary
duty.
is
it
to
the
active
employees,
to
the
retired
employees,
is
it
also
to
our
shareholders?
you
can't
have
that
sort
of
conflicting
fiduciary
duty,
which
is
one
of
the
reasons
why
this
court
held
in
spink
that
in
designing
a
plan
or
amending
the
design
of
a
plan
the
employer
is
acting
as
a
plan
sponsor.
mr.
paul
t.
cappuccio
i'm
sorry.
spink
v.
lockheed,
which
was
decided
2
years
by
this
court,
reversed
in
the
ninth
circuit.
mr.
paul
t.
cappuccio
that's
right,
your
honor,
there's
no
such
finding.
mr.
paul
t.
cappuccio
my
position,
your
honor,
would
not
be
any
different,
because
my
position
is
that
this
is
a
defined
benefits
plan,
and
even
if
the
employees
had
made
all
the
contributions,
okay,
the
deal
would
still
be
the
same.
they
would
be
guaranteed
that
they
would
get
back
at
least
those
contributions
plus
a
statutory
interest
rate
as
a
floor.
in
fact,
the
defined
benefits
were
set
significantly
higher--
mr.
paul
t.
cappuccio
--okay.
but
having
been
guaranteed
that
rate
of
return,
they
would
not
be
entitled
to
the
surplus.
in
my
world,
justice
souter--
mr.
paul
t.
cappuccio
--that's
exactly
right,
your
honor.
i
said
that...
i
misspoke,
that
the
floor
is
their
contributions
plus
their
rate
of
return,
but--
mr.
paul
t.
cappuccio
--the
floor
of
what
must
be
guaranteed,
but
in
fact
the
defined
benefits
are...
although
i
don't
have
the
particulars
here
are
regularly
significantly
above
that.
justice
scalia,
the
way
i
like
to
think
about
it
is,
these
people
are
promised,
like,
one
or
two
standard
deviations
off
performance,
or
good
performance,
and
what
they
give
up
for
that
is
the
possibility
of
bad
performance,
or
three
or
four
standard
deviations,
and
that's
a
perfectly
fine
deal
and,
frankly,
it's
one
i
wish
i
had
over
the
last
6
months.
mr.
paul
t.
cappuccio
well,
i
guess
i'd
be
somewhat
hesitant
to
say
it's
exactly
the
same,
justice
souter,
because,
of
course,
an
insurance
policy
is
not
backed
up
by
the
government,
as
this
is
here,
and
there
are
other
restrictions
that
erisa
places
on
the
use
of
funds
that
i
believe
are
not
on
an
insurance
company,
but
with
those
qualifications
it
would
be
similar,
that's
right.
let
me
address
just
briefly
the
nonfiduciary
claims
brought
by
the
respondents,
the
claims
that
do
not
depend
on
a
fiduciary
duty,
the
anti
inurement
vesting
and
post
termination
asset
distribution
claims.
we
go
over
in
the
briefs
that
these
fail
for
a
variety
of
reasons,
but
i'd
like
to
focus
the
court
today
on
i
think
what
the
one
silver
bullet
is
that
will
kill
every
one
of
those
claims
without
having
to
decide
anything
else,
and
that
is
the
one
plan,
two
plan
issue,
for
unless
the
respondents
can
defend
the
holding
by
the
court
of
appeals
that
it's
an
open
question
of
fact
whether
there
is
one
plan
or
two
plans
here,
then
all
of
their
claims
implode.
because,
of
course,
if
there's
one
plan
here
there
can't
be
any
anti
inurement
violation,
if
there's
one
plan
here,
even
if
you
let
them
prevail
on
their
ambitious
duty
to
terminate
claim,
there
can't
be
a
wasting
trust,
because
people
are
still
coming
into
the
plan,
and
they're
vesting
and
forfeiture
claim
would
also
fail.
now,
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
it
was
a
disputed
issue
of
fact
whether
it
was
one
plan
or
two.
it
is
not.
that
is,
as
judge
norris
pointed
out
in
his
dissent,
an
erroneous
conclusion
of
law
disguised
as
a
question
of
fact.
the
relevant
facts
in
this
case
are
undisputed.
they
are,
what
are
the
particular
changes
that
hughes
made
to
the
plan,
and
the
fact
that
at
least
on
the
face
of
the
documents
those
changes
are
structured
as
an
amendment
rather
than
as
a
second,
separate
plan.
framed
correctly,
the
relevant
legal
question
becomes,
is
there
anything
in
the
law
that
prevents
hughes
from
structuring
the
transaction
the
way
they
did,
and
deems
what
hughes
did
two
plans
as
a
matter
of
law,
and
the
answer
to
that
is
plainly
no.
respondents
have
not
pointed
to
anything
in
erisa
or
anywhere
else
that
would
limit...
that
would
prevent
hughes
from
doing
this
as
an
amendment.
by
the
way,
these
are
always
done
as
amendments.
all
one
has
to
do
is
look
at
the
plan
in
this
case
to
see
that
it's
a
series
of
about
six
amendments.
and
to
the
contrary
the
government
has
at
least
two
regulations
on
point
that
specifically
allow
a
single
plan
to
have
multiple
benefit
structures.
the
department
of
labor
has
a
regulation
to
that
effect,
and
the
irs
has
a
regulation
to
that
effect,
both
of
which
are
cited
in
our
briefs.
indeed,
the
same
irs
regulation
that
allows
multiple
benefit
structures
says
that
a
plan
is
a
single
plan
when
on
an
ongoing
basis
all
of
the
plan
assets
are
available
to
pay
benefits
to
employees
who
are
covered
by
the
plan.
in
other
words,
is
there
a
single
pool
of
assets?
i
will
defer
to
the
solicitor
general's
office
on
the
reasons
for
the
single
asset
test,
but
i
believe
them
to
be
that
the
government
thinks
it's
important
to
focus
on
a
single
pool
of
assets
for
purposes
of
determining
whether
the
minimum
funding
requirements,
which
are
the
real
protection
in
erisa,
are
met
in
any
case
and
also,
i
would
suppose,
that
the
single
pool
of
asset
test
furthers
the
important
government
interest
by
encouraging
employers
to
do
just
what
we
did
here,
which
is
to
have
multiple
benefit
structures
with
one
single
pool
of
assets
and
thereby
pool
and
reduce
risk.
but
in
any
event,
whatever
the
reasons
for
that,
it's
a
government
regulation
and
under
that
government
regulation
we
clearly
have
one
plan
here.
now,
the
rule
advanced
by
the
respondents
as
to
whether
there's
one
plan
or
two
plans,
that
some
lay
fact
finder
from
california,
i
suppose,
years
after
the
fact
is
going
to
determine
whether
the
changes
to
the
plan
exceeded
some
unspecified
level
of
significance,
is,
i
would
submit,
the
worst
and
most
destabilizing
possible
rules.
it
is
not
only
inherently
arbitrary,
but
it's
wildly
destabilizing
of
our
pension
system.
it
would
call
into
question
as
a
possible
anti
inurement
violation
any
routine
amendment
that
the
employer
made
either
increasing
or
changing
benefits
for
some
group
of
employees,
or
adding
a
new
category
of
participants.
it
would
thus
deprive
both
employers
and
employees
alike
of
the
very
security
that
erisa
is
intended
to
encourage
and
promote
and,
of
course,
it
would
become
doubly
destabilizing
when
combined
with
petitioner's
termination
claim,
since
it
could
turn
out
that
years
after
the
fact
there
was
an
unwitting
termination
and
suddenly
people
who
thought
they
were
accruing
benefits
find
out
that
they
were
not
accruing
benefits.
let
me
just
very
briefly,
as
i'm
cutting
into
my
rebuttal
time,
address
the
termination
claim.
respondents
have
completely
abandoned
the
only
termination
claim
that
they
brought
in
their
complaint.
count
iv
of
their
complaint
alleged
that
hughes
was
in
violation
of
erisa's
post
termination
asset
distribution
provision,
section
1344,
because
hughes
had
in
fact
1,
1991>
["]
terminated
the
plan.
the
court
of
appeals
reversed
the
district
court's
dismissal
of
that
count
on
the
ground
that
there
was
a
disputed
issue
of
fact
as
to
whether
in
fact
the
plan
had
terminated
in
1991.
in
this
court...
i
think
it's
very
significant,
in
this
court
the
respondents
do
not
even
attempt
to
defend
either
the
holding
of
the
court
of
appeals,
or
the
count
they
brought
in
their
complaint.
they
now
concede
that
the
only
way
to
have
a
termination,
at
least
the
only
means
to
have
a
termination,
is
through
the
procedures
of
section
1341
and
1342
of
the
statute,
and
they
concede
that
no
such
termination
has
occurred
here.
they
now
contend
that,
quote,
the
relevant
issue
for
this
court
is
whether
hughes
can
be
ordered
on
a
going
forward
basis
to
use
those
procedures
to
terminate
the
plan,
but
the
respondents
never
brought
any
such
duty
to
terminate
claim.
nowhere
in
their
complaint
is
any
duty
to
terminate
alleged,
and
nowhere
in
their
complaint
is
any
cause
of
action
to
enforce
that
duty
identified.
rather,
the
only
claim
that
they
brought
was
a
claim
for
a
violation
of
the
asset
distribution
provisions.
that
requires
that
there
had
been
a
determination.
they
now
concede
that
there's
not.
there
is
nothing
more
for
this
court
to
do
than
to
affirm
the
district
court's
dismissal
of
the
complaint.
thank
you,
and
if
i
could,
i'll
save
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
paul
t.

very
briefly,
justice
breyer,
our
position
of
the
donovan
line
of
cases
is
that
first
of
all
it's
a
court
of
appeals
case,
and
it
only
speaks
to
the
issue
as
to
when
a
promise
is
sufficiently
definite
so
that
it
becomes
a
plan
and
is
covered
by
erisa.
that's
not
particularly
helpful
in
determining
whether
there's
one
plan.
mr.
paul
t.
cappuccio
the
statutory
cite
for
403
is--
mr.
paul
t.
cappuccio
--it's
1103(c)
on
page--
mr.
paul
t.
cappuccio
--yes.
it's
on
page--
mr.
paul
t.
cappuccio
--92a
of
the...
in
the
petition.
mr.
paul
t.
cappuccio
justice
scalia,
or
maybe
justice
stevens,
i
forget,
i
forget
who
raised
it,
on
the
question
of
who's
a
participant,
for
purposes
of
the
anti
inurement
provision,
at
the
very
least
that
would
have
to
be
governed
by
the
statutory
definition
of
participant,
not
the
definition
in
the
plan.
i'm
going
beyond
the
briefs,
because
this
claim
hasn't
been
raised,
but
erisa
defines
participant
as
any
employee
or
former
employee
who
is
or
may
become
eligible,
so
they
are
the
same
participants
in
this
case,
because
the
nonbargaining
employees,
whether
or
not
they
ever
contributed,
were
always
able
to
become
eligible
by
contributing,
so
for
purposes
of
the
statute
it's
the
same
group
of
participants.
now,
i
heard
today
yet
another
new
claim
for
the
first
time,
which
is
that
somehow
this
is
a
breach
of
section
6.5(b)
of
the
plan.
that
was
a
claim
not
raised
in
the
court
of
appeals,
not
addressed
in
the
court
of
appeals,
not
in
the
op,
not
even
in
the
respondent's
brief,
so
that
claim
is
not
here,
but
it
would
fail
anyway.
mr.
paul
t.
cappuccio
that's
right,
and
of
course
nothing
would...
6.5(b)
doesn't
say
we
won't
make
any
amendments
that
affect
who's
a
participant.
in
fact,
anything
we
do,
since
the
eligibility
requirements
are
incorporated,
would
affect
who's
a
participant.
that's...
the
sort
of
ultimate
irony
on
the
6.5(b)
claim
would
be
that
if
it
prevailed
we
couldn't
pay
the
respondents'
benefits,
because
section
2.4
of
the
plan
excludes
retired
employees
from
the
definition
of
participant.
it
would
just
be
absurd.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i'll
submit.
