unknown
speaker
this
is
a
defined
benefit
plan,
mr.
cappuccio?
unknown
speaker
and
your
point
is
that
they
have
received
the
benefits
defined
under
the
plan?
unknown
speaker
and
i
suppose
under
that
plan
there
might
be
a
deficit
instead
of
a
surplus.
unknown
speaker
and
the
theory
of
the
court
below,
if
there
were
a
deficit,
would
be
what?
unknown
speaker
are
these
defined
benefit
plans
becoming
used
less
often
in
today's
world?
is
this...
are
they
almost
extinct
as
a
species,
or
still
exist?
unknown
speaker
if
this
were
a
voluntary
plan,
then
would
the
employees
be
entitled
to
all
the
benefits?
unknown
speaker
they're
man...
after
the
amendment
they
were
not
mandatory
because
you
could
go
to
the
other
side.
you
could
go
to
the
other
side
of
the
plan.
unknown
speaker
you
had
to
make
the
election
at
one
time
and
then
you
were...
you
couldn't
reelect
to
go
under
the
noncontributory--
unknown
speaker
--mr.
cappuccio,
did
you
mean
to
say,
which
plan
you
choose
to
be
in?
unknown
speaker
i
see.
unknown
speaker
well,
if
you
could
change
from
the
contributory
to
the
noncontributory
at
any
time,
then
it
would
look
more
like
a
voluntary
plan.
unknown
speaker
mr.
cappuccio,
is
this
kind
of
amendment
commonplace,
or
is
it
extraordinary,
that
you
go
from
a
contributory
plan
to
one
in
which
there
are
no
contributions?
unknown
speaker
you
make
the
point
that
in
amending
the
plan
you
are
not
acting
as
a
fiduciary
and
that
what
spink
held,
but
is
there
any...
any
control
over
what
legitimately
constitutes
an
amendment
to
the
plan?
unknown
speaker
what
was
the
case
you
just
referred
to?
unknown
speaker
mr.
cappuccio,
am
i
right
in
my
understanding
that
there
is
no
finding
here
that
the
assets
transferred
for
the
benefit
of
the
new
noncontributory
option
are
themselves
attributable
to
contributions
by
the
employees
under
the
plan
as
originally
drafted?
unknown
speaker
what
if
there
were?
would
your
position
be
different?
unknown
speaker
uh
huh.
unknown
speaker
they're
guaranteed
more
than
the
right
of
return.
they're
also
guaranteed
the
promised
benefits,
which
are
a
good
deal
higher
than
that.
unknown
speaker
the
floor
of
what
must
be
guaranteed.
unknown
speaker
so
basically,
to
use
a
term
that
has
come
up
in
the
briefs,
i
guess
the
only
real
difference
between
this
and
an
insurance
policy
is
the
consequence
on
dissolution,
on
termination.
unknown
speaker
thank
you,
mr.
cappuccio.
ms.
blatt,
we'll
hear
from
you.
unknown
speaker
well,
ms.
blatt,
what
do
you
make
of
the
apparently
new
claim
asserted
now
that
the
court
should
order
a
termination?
unknown
speaker
i
take
it
that
your...
the
position
of
the
solicitor
general
is
not
significantly
different
from
that
of
the
dissent,
is
it,
judge
norris'
dissent.
is
there
any
difference?
unknown
speaker
no.
thank
you.
unknown
speaker
have
there
been
any
cases...
have
there
been
any
cases
in
which
amendments
have
been
so
extensive
that
the
government
has
determined
there
are
really
two
plans?
are
there
any
regulations
or
cases
on
that
point?
unknown
speaker
ms.
blatt,
i
was
just
going
to
say,
my...
i
guess
my
use
of
the
word
transfer
was
not
the
right
term,
but
even
if
there
had
been
a
transfer
under
1050...
section
1058,
the
result
would
be
the
same
so
long
as
the
benefits
for
the
beneficiaries
of
the
plan
for
which
the
transfer
had
been
made
were
covered.
unknown
speaker
so
far
as
erisa
itself
was
concerned,
it
would
be
the
same
result,
wouldn't
it?
unknown
speaker
thank
you,
ms.
blatt.
mr.
kupferberg,
we'll
hear
from
you.
unknown
speaker
now,
mr.
kupferberg,
the
solicitor
general
says
all
three
agencies
of
government
responsible
for
this
say
this
was
not
a
new
plan.
unknown
speaker
what
do
you
believe
the
legal
test
for
deciding
whether
there's
a
new
plan...
obviously,
it's
of
considerable
significance.
unknown
speaker
i
asked
you--
unknown
speaker
--well,
where
does
it
stem
from?
what
body
of
law?
unknown
speaker
and
after
you've
done
all
that,
then--
unknown
speaker
--so
it's
an
ex
post
determination
in
every
case,
i
take
it.
unknown
speaker
but...
and
it
has
to
be
made
after
the
fact,
i
suppose.
unknown
speaker
well,
if
you
have
those
four
variables--
unknown
speaker
--nobody
is
going
to
be
able
to
tell
until
some,
you
know,
judge
or
jury--
unknown
speaker
--yes,
but--
unknown
speaker
--may
i
just
interrupt?
unknown
speaker
but
suppose
you
have,
as
you
do
in
this
case,
a
common
pool
of
assets.
unknown
speaker
are
there
any
examples
you
can
give
us
of
a
common
pool
of
assets
with
multiple
benefit
structures
which
would
be
more
than
one
plan?
unknown
speaker
well,
but
suppose--
unknown
speaker
--supposing
from
the
outset
of
the
plan
they
had
two
classes
of
employees,
one
of
whom
would
get
one
set
of
benefits
and
another...
the
truck
drivers
are
one,
and
manufacturing
employees
another.
they
get
entirely
separate
benefits,
but
they...
and
the
plan
is
entirely
funded
by
the
employer,
but...
and
there's
one
pool
of
assets
that
covers
both
sets
of
benefits.
there
would
be
one
plan
or
two,
under
your
view?
unknown
speaker
be
one--
unknown
speaker
--supposing
it's
entirely
funded
by
employee
contributions,
10
percent
of
their
wages,
say.
unknown
speaker
well,
but
that's
a
long
answer.
are
you
saying
that
makes
it
two
plans,
or
is
it
one
plan?
unknown
speaker
well...
no,
i...
you--
unknown
speaker
--i've
given
you
the
facts.
i've
given
you
the
facts.
there's
an
original
plan
set
up,
and
say
there's
a
joint
contribution,
some
by
the
employer
and
some
by
the
employee,
and
there...
one
class
of
employees
gets
one
set
of
benefits,
which
is
entirely
different
from
the
benefits
paid
to
another
set.
now,
is
it
one
plan
or
two?
unknown
speaker
so
the
test
is
whether
there
are
differing
sets
of
benefits.
unknown
speaker
i
don't
understand
the
regulation
you
quoted.
you
quoted
a
regulation--
unknown
speaker
--on
page
128a.
unknown
speaker
but
then
you
didn't
seem
to
read
or
refer
to
its
definition.
in
my
copy
it
says,
a
plan
is
a
single
plan
if
and
only
if
on
an
ongoing
basis
all
of
the
plan
assets
are
available
to
pay
benefits
to
employees
who
are
covered
by
the
plan
and
their
beneficiaries.
unknown
speaker
that's
what
it
says.
now,
you
agree
with
that
definition.
unknown
speaker
do
you
agree
with
the
definition,
or
do
you
not?
unknown
speaker
i'm
sorry,
i'm
asking
you
if
you
agree
with
that
definition.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
oh.
in
other
words,
you're
saying
that
this
definition
is
not
a
correct
definition
for
your...
for
what?
unknown
speaker
why
not?
unknown
speaker
all
right.
now
can
i
ask
you
a
different--
unknown
speaker
--all
right.
i
have
the
answer
to
the
question.
now
i'll
ask
you
a
different
question.
unknown
speaker
the
different
question
is,
is
it
conceded
that
all
of
the
plan
assets
are
available
to
pay
benefits
to
employees
who
are
covered
by
the
plan?
unknown
speaker
are
you
conceding
that,
yes
or
no?
unknown
speaker
you
are
not
conceding
that.
all
right.
fine.
so
you
say,
in
other
words,
that
all
of
the
assets
of
this
plan
are
not
available
to
pay
benefits
to
employees
who
are
covered.
unknown
speaker
okay.
unknown
speaker
could
you
refer
me
to
the
document
in
which
that...
i
guess
that
may
be
a
disputed
issue
of
fact.
will
you
refer
me
to
the
document
in
the
record
that
says
you
do
not
agree
with
that,
that
says,
in
our
plan
it
is
not
the
case
that
all
the
plan
assets
are
available
to
pay
benefits
to
employees,
because
i
missed
that.
i
didn't
see--
unknown
speaker
--i
thought
that
was
conceded.
unknown
speaker
no,
no,
what
i'm
asking
for,
because
i
won't
be
able
to
take
it
in
orally,
could
you
refer
me
to
the
page
in
the
record
where
it
says
with,
i
hope,
clarity,
that
you
dispute
the
factual
proposition,
or
the
legal
proposition
that
all
of
the
plan
assets
are
available
to
pay
benefits
to
the
employees?
unknown
speaker
i'm
saying...
i'm
trying
to
find
out...
i
read
you
this.
unknown
speaker
i
read
all
of
the
plan
assets
are
available
to
pay
benefits
to
employees.
that's
what
seems
to
be
the
definition
in
the
section
to
which
you
referred,
for
purposes
of
that
section.
unknown
speaker
so
i
said,
is
there
a
factual
dispute,
yes
or
no,
as
to
whether
that
sentence
is
satisfied
here.
you
said
yes,
there
is
a
factual
dispute.
unknown
speaker
so
now
i'm
asking
where
in
the
record
i
can
find
out
that
there
is
that
factual
dispute.
unknown
speaker
no,
i'm
asking
a
different...
i
won't
ask
it
any
more.
i--
unknown
speaker
--well,
let
me
try.
what
he
wants
to
know
is,
where
in
the
record
does
it
appear
that
you
joined
issue
with
your
opponents
on
that
point?
unknown
speaker
where
did
you
say
no,
that
provision
in
fact
is
not
satisfied?
where
in
your
pleadings,
for
example?
unknown
speaker
mr.
kupferberg,
suppose
at
the
outset
hughes
had
written,
we
now
have
a
contributory
plan.
unknown
speaker
we
reserve
the
right
to
amend
that
plan
to
make
it
noncontributory,
at
which
time
all
of
the
people
who
are
then
covered
would
have
the
choice
of
one
plan
or
the
other,
and
the
new
employees
would
have
only
the
noncontributory
plan.
suppose
that
had
all
been
said
at
the
outset,
here
we
have
a
contributory
plan,
but
we
reserve
the
right
to
make
it
noncontributory.
unknown
speaker
i'm
not
sure
that
i
understand
what
is
your
answer
to
my
question.
same
plant
employees,
same
category
of
employees.
unknown
speaker
the
plant
says
at
the
outset,
employees,
we
have
this
plan.
we
reserve
the
right
to
change
it,
at
which
time
those
of
you
who
were
here--
unknown
speaker
--but
these
benefits...
this
is
only
being
used
for
benefits
for
people
who
are
in
this
category
of
employment,
so
how
does
that
violate
the
anti
inurement
provision?
unknown
speaker
why
does
it
inure
to
the
benefit
of
the
employer
if
it
goes
to
a
separate
group
of
employees,
but
does
not
inure
to
the
benefit
of
the
employer
if
it
goes
to
the
current
group
of
employees?
unknown
speaker
so
the
whole
argument
hinges
on
your
assertion
that
there
are
two
plans.
unknown
speaker
the
entire
argument,
because
it's
clear
that
money
that
is
given
to
employees
does
not
inure
to
the
benefit
of
the
employer
for
purposes
of
erisa.
that's
the
whole
theory
of
it.
unknown
speaker
i
think
that's
right.
i
think
they
would
accept
that,
that
their
case
hinges
on
the
fact
that
there's
one
plan,
and
yours
hinges
on
the
fact
that
there's
two.
unknown
speaker
do
you
acknowledge
that
if
there's...
if
there
are
not
two
plans,
you
have
no
case?
unknown
speaker
excuse
me.
i
don't
know
what
you
mean,
if
the
reversionary
were
completely
wiped
out--
unknown
speaker
--even
if
they
got
the
defined
benefits?
unknown
speaker
where
is
that
contained?
unknown
speaker
but
i
don't
see
that
the
anti
inurement
provision,
which
says
that
the
assets
of
a
plan
shall
never
inure
to
the
benefit
of
any
employer,
and
held
for
exclusive...
creates
what
you
call
a
reversionary
interest.
unknown
speaker
which
section
are
you
now
referring
to,
mr.
kupferberg?
unknown
speaker
1103,
yes.
unknown
speaker
so
in
your
opinion,
then,
if
a
typical
company
has,
let's
say,
50
or
100,000
employees,
and
there
are
all
kinds
of
different
classes
of
benefit,
and
one
day
the
employer
says,
well,
i'm
going
to
create
another
new
class
of
benefit,
as
it's
his
right,
and
it
turns
out
that
this
new
class
of
benefit,
when
you
work
it
out
actuarially,
will
be
funded
in
part
by
money
that
were
he
not
to
create
this
new
class
of
benefit
might
have
been
used
by
other
classes
of
employees
to
pay
those
pensions
at
some
time,
or
at
least
they're
attributable
to
those.
every
time
that
happens,
which
could
be,
let's
say,
on
the
average
of
10,000
times
a
week
across
an
economy
with
240
million
people,
every
time
that
happens,
what
has
happened
is
there
are
new
plans
created,
and
all
the
provisions
of
erisa
that
come
into
play--
unknown
speaker
--all
these
anti
inurement
things--
unknown
speaker
--no.
well
then,
what's...
when?
unknown
speaker
all
right.
so
then,
what's
the
definition
of
these
words,
drastic
effect?
in
other
words,
you're
saying
if,
in
fact,
there
is
an
attributable
surplus
at
this
moment
in
time...
the
stock
market
changes,
of
course,
but
at
this
moment
in
time
there's
a
$2
surplus,
and
so
in
fact
those
$2
might
help
to
fund
this
new
class
of
benefits.
that,
i
take
it,
is
not
drastic.
unknown
speaker
all
right.
but
$20
billion
would
be.
unknown
speaker
all
right.
so
what
we're
going
to
do
is
involve
the
federal
courts
in
deciding
what
is
or
is
not
drastic,
and
do
we
just
use
the
word
drastic,
or
is
there
something
else
we
might
use?
unknown
speaker
what's
an
easy
case?
wait,
when
you
say
there
are
two
plans--
unknown
speaker
--you
can't
say
there
are
two
plans
at
the
moment.
what
we're
looking
for
is
the
defining
legal
characteristic
that
tells
us
whether
there
are
two
plans,
and
right
now
it
seems
to
me
to
hinge
on
the
word
drastic.
unknown
speaker
so
what
i'm
asking
you
is,
what's
the
definition
of
drastic?
how
do
we
deal
with
that?
unknown
speaker
of
course,
there
is
here
another
way.
you
say
it's
up
to
the
employer.
he
can
do
what
he
wants.
he
pays
the
employees
the
benefits
he
promised
them.
if
he
wants
to
terminate
the
plan
he
can.
if
he
doesn't
want
to,
he
doesn't
have
to.
now,
what's
wrong
with
that?
unknown
speaker
then
why
isn't
your
answer
the
same
with
the
$2
example?
unknown
speaker
okay,
but
in
principle.
in
principle,
your
answer
would
be
the
same.
unknown
speaker
mr.
kupferberg,
i'm
trying
to
find
some
statutory
language
that
we
can
talk
about
here,
as
opposed
to
drastic.
you
rely
a
lot
on
section
403.
unknown
speaker
where
is
that
contained
in
the
materials?
i
don't
find
it
in
the
appendix.
unknown
speaker
90a,
but
it's
not
in
the
appendix--
unknown
speaker
--which
is
entitled,
pertinent
statutory
provisions?
unknown
speaker
may--
unknown
speaker
--may
i
just
ask,
your
case
really
boils
down
to
a
claim
that
the
word
participants
in
6.5(b)
does
not
include
the
people
who
would
benefit
from
what
we've
described
as
a
second
plan?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
and
is
the
term
participant
defined
in
the
trust
instrument?
unknown
speaker
in
the
definitions
section,
is
it
or
it
isn't?
unknown
speaker
it's
not
in
the--
unknown
speaker
--page
4
to
5
of
the
red
brief?
unknown
speaker
a
participant
is
any
person
included
in
the
plan
as
provided,
and
so
forth.
unknown
speaker
so
it
really
boils
down
to
the
question
of
whether
it's
one
or
two
plans,
because
if
it's
one
plan,
then
participant
does
pick
up
the
new
people.
unknown
speaker
so
your
whole
case
really
depends
on
whether
it's
one
or
two
plans.
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
also
on
your
anti
inurement
argument,
supposing
the
plan,
jointly
funded
plan,
both
employers
and
employees
contribute,
has
a
big
surplus,
as
is
alleged
this
one
was,
and
the
sponsor
adopted
an
amendment
saying,
there'll
be
no
contributions
for
the
next
3
years
because
there's
plenty
of...
the
actuaries
have
told
us
there's
plenty
of
money
in
the
fund.
would
that
violate
the
statute?
unknown
speaker
why
would
that
provide
any
greater
benefit
for
the
employer
than
this
does?
unknown
speaker
no,
it's
having...
the
plan
pays
these
people.
that's
the
taking
out
you're
talking
about.
unknown
speaker
no
money
ever
goes
into
the
employer's
general
funds.
unknown
speaker
well,
but
there
is...
it
has
used
its
own
assets
to
create
a
fund
that's
adequate
to
pay
off
all
the
defined
benefits.
unknown
speaker
well,
supposing
they--
unknown
speaker
--supposing
then
in
my
example,
in
addition
to
saying
there'll
be
no
contributions
for
the
next
3
years,
they
also
had
a
second
amendment
at
the
same
time,
an
additional
group
of
employees
shall
now
become
eligible
for
benefits.
you
just
add
another
1,000
employees.
would
that
make
a
second
plan?
unknown
speaker
but
there's
enough...
even
if
there's
enough
money
to
pay
the
million,
to
pay
the
benefits
for
the
million?
why
is
1
million
different
from
1,000?
i
don't
understand.
unknown
speaker
mr.
kupferberg,
what
you
described,
then,
was
characterized
by
hughes...
it
seems
quite
accurate.
you
say
the
fiduciary
obligation
to
protect
the
reversionary
interest,
that
what
you
are
saying
is
that
this
is
not
a
defined
benefit
program,
it
is
indeed
a
defined
contribution
program
with
a
defined
benefit
floor,
this
kind
of
hybrid.
unknown
speaker
well
then,
in
answer
to
justice
stevens'
hypothetical
there
is
no
difference
between
the
1,000
beneficiaries
and
the
million
beneficiaries.
unknown
speaker
but...
because
i
know
your
basic
argument,
but
if
i
said,
i
think
a
plan
is
just
using
the
common
assets
for
all
the
employees,
you
would
say,
no,
no,
that's
wrong.
unknown
speaker
for
these
purposes.
unknown
speaker
and
your
best
authority
that
you
would
cite
in
support
of
your
statement,
that's
wrong,
is
what?
unknown
speaker
but
is
there
any
case
or
anything?
section
403,
and
what
else?
unknown
speaker
wait...
section
403--
unknown
speaker
--okay,
and
what
else?
unknown
speaker
termination,
do
you
think
termination
is
a
term
of
art?
unknown
speaker
that
is
not,
either.
unknown
speaker
did
you
argue
to
the
ninth
circuit
that
you
should
have
been
granted
leave
to
amend?
unknown
speaker
i
think
you've
answered
the
question.
thank
you,
mr.
kupferberg.
unknown
speaker
mr.
cappuccio,
you
have
3
minutes
remaining.
unknown
speaker
and
the
statutory
cite
for
403
is
what?
unknown
speaker
1103.
it's
1103.
unknown
speaker
i
wish
counsel
would
stick
to
using
either
the--
unknown
speaker
--u.s.c.--
unknown
speaker
--right.
unknown
speaker
except
i
really
think
that
claim
is
just
another
way
of
stating
the
basic
position
there
are
two
plans.
that's
his
argument.
