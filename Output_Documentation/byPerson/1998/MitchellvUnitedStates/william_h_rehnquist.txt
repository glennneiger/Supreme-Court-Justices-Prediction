we'll
hear
argument
next
in
number
97-7541,
amanda
mitchell
v.
the
united
states.
mr.
morley.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
dreeben.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
have
the
opinions
of
the
court
to
announce
in
three
cases.
the
first
is
97-7541,
amanda
mitchell
versus
united
states.
now,
the
petitioner
amanda
mitchell
pleaded
guilty
to
conspiracy
to
distribute
cocaine,
but
reserve
the
right
to
contest
the
amount
of
drugs
attributable
to
her
at
sentencing.
the
sentencing
hearing
witnesses
for
the
government
testified
that
the
amounts
of
drugs
were
substantial
and
mitchell
distributed
this
without
taking
the
stand
to
testify.
the
district
court
ruled
that
is
a
consequence
of
her
guilty
plea.
mitchell
had
no
rights
to
remain
silent
with
respect
to
the
details
of
her
crimes.
in
imposing
a
10-year
sentence
the
judge
told
mitchell
that
he
held
it
against
her
but
she
did
not
come
forward
and
explained
her
side
of
the
dispute.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
third
circuit
affirmed
the
sentence
and
held
it
by
pleading
guilty
to
the
offense
mitchell
have
waived
her
fifth
amendment
privilege.
in
an
opinion
authored
by
justice
kennedy
we
hold
that
a
guilty
plea
is
not
a
waiver
of
the
fifth
amendment
privilege
at
the
sentencing.
it
is
well-established
that
a
witness
in
a
single
proceeding
may
not
testify
voluntarily
about
a
subject
and
then
invoke
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination
when
questioned
about
the
details.
that
is
because
a
witness
cannot
pick
and
choose
what
aspects
of
a
particular
subject
to
discuss
without
casting
doubt
on
the
trustworthiness
of
the
statement.
the
concerns
which
justify
requiring
the
defendant
to
undergo
cross-examination
when
he
or
she
testifies
are
absent
at
a
plea
colloquy,
however.
instead
of
presenting
testimony
that
puts
facts
into
dispute
the
defendant
who
pleads
guilty
takes
matters
out
of
dispute
often
by
confirming
the
prosecutions
version
of
the
facts.
under
these
circumstances
there
is
little
danger
that
the
court
will
be
misled
by
selective
disclosure,
nor
does
the
federal
rule
of
criminal
procedure
11
which
governs
pleas
contemplate
the
broad
waiver
of
the
privilege.
treating
a
guilty
plea
as
a
waiver
of
the
privilege
at
sentencing
would
encroach
on
the
rights
of
defendants.
were
we
to
accept
the
government’s
position
prosecutors
could
indict
without
specifying
the
quantity
of
drugs
involved,
obtain
a
guilty
plea,
and
then
put
the
defendant
on
the
stand
of
sentencing
to
fill
in
the
drug
quantity.
we
also
hold
that
the
district
court
was
not
entitled
based
on
mitchell’s
silence
to
draw
an
adverse
inference
with
regard
to
the
amount
of
drugs
attributable
to
her.
justice
scalia
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
which
has
been
joined
by
justice
o’connor,
justice
thomas,
and
me;
justice
thomas
has
also
filed
a
dissenting
opinion.
