mr.
steven
a.
morley
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
fifth
amendment
is
clear
in
its
language.
no
person
shall
be
compelled
in
any
criminal
case
to
be
a
witness
against
himself,
and
yet
in
this
criminal
case
the
district
court
used
the
defendant's
silence,
invoked
to
protect
her
from
risking
an
increase
in
her
own
sentence,
as
a
basis
to
fashion
a
sentence.
in
doing
so,
the
court
fundamentally
altered
the
sentencing
proceedings
from
that
which
had
been
specifically
promised
to
this
defendant
at
the
time
of
her
colloquy,
and
from
that
which
is
generally
applicable
in
criminal
process.
mr.
steven
a.
morley
the
trial
judge
has
discretion
to
make
certain
that
there's
a
foundation
for
the
guilty
plea,
and
certainly
the
trial
judge
can
say
to
the
defendant,
i'm
not
going
to
take
your
plea
unless
you
tell
me
everything,
but
then
the
trial
judge
has
the
opportunity
to
say,
i'm
not
going
to
take
your
plea,
and
the
defendant
would
also
be
given
the
opportunity
to
say,
judge,
i'm
willing
to
tell
you
enough
that
admits
to
the
essential
elements
of
this
offense,
but
i'm
not
getting
into
any
sentencing
factors.
mr.
steven
a.
morley
i
think
the
judge
has
a...
i'm
not
sure
the
cases
say
that
he
can't
accept
the
plea.
i
think
the...
the
cases
seem
to
say
that
the
trial
judge
has
the
authority
to
make
sure
that
there's
a
factual
foundation,
a
factual
statement,
and
that--
mr.
steven
a.
morley
--yes,
it
does,
and
i
think
under--
mr.
steven
a.
morley
--i
haven't
seen
cases
on
that,
but
think
libretti--
mr.
steven
a.
morley
--typically
that's
true.
mr.
steven
a.
morley
well,
your
honor,
actually
what
judge
cahn
said...
and
i
refer
to
page
45
of
the
joint
appendix
toward
the
top...
judge
cahn
said,
you
have
the
right
at
trial
to
remain
silent
under
the
fifth
amendment
or
at
your
option
you
can
take
the
stand
and
tell
the
jury
your
side
of
the
controversy,
so
judge
cahn
specifically
limited
the
waiver
of
the
fifth
amendment
to
the
right
at
trial.
mr.
steven
a.
morley
but
even
beyond
that,
i
still
believe
that
the
cases
point
to
the
fact
that
one
does
have
a
fifth
amendment
right
at
sentencing.
this
comes
really
from
two
sources.
mr.
steven
a.
morley
yes,
there
would
be
a
difference
in
that
way.
mr.
steven
a.
morley
in
a
plea
colloquy
the
defendant
is
really
giving
his
or
her
admission
to
the
essential
elements
of
the
offense
so
that
a
legal
conclusion
can
be
drawn
right
at
that
time
to
the
effect
that
individual
is
guilty.
that
is
all
that
it's
involved
in.
at
a
trial,
when
a
defendant
takes
the
witness
stand--
mr.
steven
a.
morley
--precisely,
and--
mr.
steven
a.
morley
--well,
this
court
in
libretti
made
clear
that
forfeiture
is
a
sentencing
issue,
and
therefore
need
not
be
part
of
the
factual
understanding,
the
factual
statement
under
rule
11.
mr.
steven
a.
morley
this
was
a
drug
statute,
8...
it
was
the
conspiracy
statute.
it
was
the
846
statute
in
which
drug
quantities
are
not
part
of
the...
not
an
element
of
the
offense,
but
they
are
part
of
the
sentencing.
mr.
steven
a.
morley
absolutely,
it
is
not
an
element
of
the
offense.
mr.
steven
a.
morley
i
would
be
willing
to
give
a
judge
that
discretion.
i'm
not
sure
that
it's
an
abuse
of
discretion.
i
think
our
district
court
judges
are
by
and
large
well-founded
in
the--
mr.
steven
a.
morley
--well,
i...
perhaps
i've
conceded
too
much,
justice
kennedy,
but
at
any
rate--
mr.
steven
a.
morley
--no.
mr.
steven
a.
morley
right.
the
judge,
as
far
as...
i
mean,
the
judge
can
always
say,
i
won't
take
this
plea,
the
defendant
must
go
to
trial.
mr.
steven
a.
morley
that's
as...
exactly,
that's
as
far
as
the
waiver
goes,
and--
mr.
steven
a.
morley
--yes,
precisely.
but
if
i
could
get
back
to
mr.
justice
souter's
question
about
the
difference
at
a
trial,
at
a
trial,
the
waiver
concept
there
is
where
a
defendant
would
testify,
and
in
that
sense
would
be
giving
up
his
entire
right
because
he
is
testifying,
and
that
the...
and
the
government
would
have
the
opportunity
to
cross-examine
him
on
that
testimony,
and
really
what
underlies
that
waiver
is
a
rule
of
fairness.
we're
not
going
to
let
a
defendant
get
up
in
front
of
a
jury,
testify
as
to
facts,
and
then
cut
off
cross-examination
to
matters
that
are
relevant
at
trial.
in
the
guilty
plea
context
the
sentencing
issue
is
simply
not
relevant.
sentencing
factors
are
not
relevant
to
the
waiver
of
the--
mr.
steven
a.
morley
--of
that...
of
the
rights
that...
for
the...
because
they
do
not
relate
to
the
essential
elements
of
the
offense.
mr.
steven
a.
morley
i
don't
believe
so,
your
honor.
i
think
what's
important
at
the
plea
hearing--
mr.
steven
a.
morley
--yes.
i
would--
mr.
steven
a.
morley
--i
would
say
it
would
be
an
abuse
of
discretion
in
that
sense.
what
i
think
happens...
what's
important
at
the
plea
hearing
is
that
the
defendant
understand
the
consequences.
that's
what
the
cases
say,
and
in
that
sense
what
the
judge
can
do
is
say--
mr.
steven
a.
morley
--except
the
judge
can
achieve
that,
as
judge
cahn
did
in
this
case,
by
engaging
in
a
colloquy
that
lays
out,
you've
reserved
for
sentencing
the
drug
quantity
analysis
which
will
drive
your
sentence.
the
government
says
it's
more
than
5
kilograms,
and
if
they
are
able
to
prove
it
you'll
be
subject
to
this
kind
of
sentence.
mr.
steven
a.
morley
on
the
other
hand,
you've
saying--
mr.
steven
a.
morley
--i
would
say
two
things.
well,
first...
first,
it's
subject
to
the
rules
of
the
constitutional
privilege
of
self-incrimination
because
of
the
language
of
the
constitution
itself.
no
person
shall
be
compelled
in
any
criminal
case
to
be
a
witness
against
himself.
sentencing
is
part
of
the
criminal
case,
and
it
is
an
accusatorial,
adversarial
proceeding
in
which
the
government
has
the
burden
of
proof.
what
we're
saying
here
is
that
the
government
can
come
into
a
court
armed
with
a
lower
standard
of
proof.
they
can
take
hearsay,
they
can
take
all
sort
and
manner
of
evidence,
but
the
one
place
they
cannot
take
it
is
from
the
mouth
of
the
defendant.
mr.
steven
a.
morley
as
to
this...
as
to
that
individual,
incriminatory...
exactly.
mr.
steven
a.
morley
yes.
mr.
steven
a.
morley
those
cases
really
derive
from
a
factual
setting,
a
hearing,
an
evidentiary
hearing
of
some
manner
or
form.
they
are
really...
what's
grounded
behind
those
rules
of,
once
you
start
talking
you
cannot
stop,
is
a
sense
of
fairness.
we're
not
going
to
let
a
witness
cut
off
inquiry,
at
a
guilty
plea
colloquy
defendant
is
frequently
a
monosyllabic
response,
yes
i
agree
that
that--
mr.
steven
a.
morley
--no,
it
doesn't,
but
it's
what
under
underlies
blau.
mr.
steven
a.
morley
no,
your
honor.
mr.
steven
a.
morley
i
think
that
that's
what...
well,
that's
the
way
i
read
blau
and
read
brown
v.
walker.
mr.
steven
a.
morley
no,
your
honor.
that
was
a...
that...
that
statement--
mr.
steven
a.
morley
--that
statement
is--
mr.
steven
a.
morley
--judge,
that
statement
that
ms.
mitchell
made
was
her
right
of
allocution,
which
the
judge
specifically
granted
to
her.
it
was
just
a
final
statement
to
the
court
not
meant
to...
not
meant
to
be
testimonial
in
that
sense.
mr.
steven
a.
morley
she
was
sworn
at
the
plea
colloquy.
i
believe
she
was
sworn
at
the
sentencing.
mr.
steven
a.
morley
no.
that
was
at...
when
she
said
i
did
some
drugs--
mr.
steven
a.
morley
--but
i
couldn't
do
everything
they
said
i
did,
that
was
her
right
of
allocution
at
the
conclusion
of
the
sentencing
hearing.
mr.
steven
a.
morley
that
might
be
true
if
there
were
a
plea
agreement,
but
in
this
case
this
is
a...
this
was
an
open...
open
plea.
mr.
steven
a.
morley
there
was
no
plea
agreement.
my
client
pled
guilty,
open
to
the
court,
specifically
reserving
for
sentence
purpose
the
drug
quantity
analysis,
and
that
was
a
condition
of
a...
it
was
a
conditional
guilty
plea,
in
that
sense.
mr.
steven
a.
morley
that
certainly
would
be
simpler.
the
problem
is,
we
have
an
accusatorial
system
of
justice,
not
an
inquisitional
one.
that's
what
our
fifth
amendment
cases
tell
us.
mr.
steven
a.
morley
and
given
that,
what
happens
at
a
sentencing
hearing,
where
the
government
has
the
burden
of
proof,
is
that
they
will
start
calling
defendants
as
witnesses
to
extract
from
them
what
it
is,
in
fact,
they
did,
if
this
court
deems
a
guilty
plea
to
be
a
waiver.
mr.
steven
a.
morley
i
think
it's
a
case-by-case
basis.
i
think--
mr.
steven
a.
morley
--i
think--
mr.
steven
a.
morley
--well,
i
think
that--
mr.
steven
a.
morley
--i
think
that...
i
think
that
there--
mr.
steven
a.
morley
--i
think
in
cases,
in
drug
cases
particularly,
where
the
government
is
relying
heavily
upon
the
testimony
of
cooperating
individuals
whose
credibility
is
suspect,
as
it
was
in
this
case,
it
is
very...
it
is
not
unusual
for
a
defendant
to
say,
i'm
not
going
to
testify.
i'm
going
to
rely
upon
whether
or
not
the
government
has
established,
by
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence,
extrapolating
the
drug
quantities
from
the
testimony
as
to
whether
or
not
he's...
that
they've
established
sufficient
drug
quantities
to
meet
the
various
sentencing
guidelines
and
mandatory
minimums.
mr.
steven
a.
morley
i
think
this
happens
quite
frequently
because
of
the
nature
of
drug...
particularly
in
drug
prosecutions.
because
of
the
nature
of
the
drug
prosecution,
with
its
extrapolation,
with
its
reliance
upon
informants,
and
witnesses
who
are
subject
to
questionable
credibility,
it's
not
at
all
unusual
for
defendant
to
take--
mr.
steven
a.
morley
--those
statements,
taken
at
face
value,
certainly
support
the
government's
position,
but
if
you
look
behind
those
statements
a
little
bit
more
and
look
more
closely,
they
really
go
to
the
elements
of
the
offense,
the
fact
of
incrimination
of
an
offense.
in
estelle,
this
court...
in
estelle
v.
smith,
this
court
ruled--
mr.
steven
a.
morley
--that
was
a
death
penalty
case.
mr.
steven
a.
morley
frequently
this
court
has
done
so.
however--
mr.
steven
a.
morley
--well,
estelle
first
of
all--
mr.
steven
a.
morley
--there
was
no
guilty
plea
in
estelle.
if
i
might
address
the
capital
sentencing
aspect,
your
honor,
because
i
think
it's
important,
while
estelle
was
a
capital
sentencing
case,
it
did
not
ground
itself
on
the
fact
that
it
was
a
capital
case.
it
rose
out
of
that
factual
setting
in
the
same
way
one
might
say
miranda
rose
out
of
a
death
penalty
case.
mr.
steven
a.
morley
i
don't
read
the
subsequent
cases
as
limiting
estelle
in
that
way
and,
in
fact,
estelle's
based
upon
the
broad
principles
of
the
fifth
amendment,
gault,
which
is
a
juvenile
case.
and
if
you
look
closely
at
some
of
the
death
penalty
cases,
this
court
is
looking
at...
when
it
says
death
is
different,
looking
at
the
sense
of...
searching
for
more
reliability
in
those
cases,
permitting
a
more
flexible
sense
of
due
process,
saying
we're
going
to
have
a
higher
standard
of
due
process
in
a
death
penalty
case.
we
want
to
be
more
reliable.
we
want
to
be
more
sure,
because
of
the
different
nature
of
the
death
penalty.
the
fifth
amendment
compulsion
against
self-incrimination
does
not
go
to
issues
of
reliability.
it
goes
to
issues
of...
that...
it
goes
to
issues
that
ensure
a
particular
form
of
justice,
an
accusatorial
versus
an
inquisitional
form
of
justice.
mr.
steven
a.
morley
no,
judge,
i
think...
no,
your
honor.
i
don't
think
that
that
can
be
done.
mr.
steven
a.
morley
the
negative
inference
language
is...
is
a
way
that
this
court
has
given
voice
to
violations
of
the
self-incrimination
clause
of
the
fifth
amendment.
mr.
steven
a.
morley
well,
griffin
is
a
1967
decision,
so
it's
about
30
years.
mr.
steven
a.
morley
the
cases
that
address...
i
don't
think
it's
so
much
a
matter
of
extension,
but
i
think
if
you
want
to
look
at
it
that
way,
yes,
you
do,
because
this
court's
cases
that
have
looked
at
the
right
of
a
judge
or
prosecutor
to
take
a
negative
inference
from
the
invocation
of
the
fifth
amendment
have
done
so
along
a
particular
divide,
and
that
divide
is
a
civil-criminal
divide.
one
looks
at
ward,
u.s.
v.
ward.
that's
a
civil
penalty
case,
a
negative
inference
is
permitted
there.
mr.
steven
a.
morley
your
honors--
mr.
steven
a.
morley
--one
could
do
that,
except
here,
to
do
that
would
do
violence
to
the
basic
principle
here
of,
in
any
criminal
case,
and
we
still
have--
mr.
steven
a.
morley
--the--
mr.
steven
a.
morley
--the
problem
with
doing
that,
your
honor,
is
that
it
burdens
the
fifth
amendment
right,
and
griffin
and
its
line
of
cases
don't
rest
upon
the
fact
that
there
are
jury
trials.
they
rest
upon
the
fact
that
it's
an
impermissible
burden
on
the
fifth
amendment.
mr.
steven
a.
morley
in
that
case,
your
honor--
mr.
steven
a.
morley
--as
nontestifying.
that
would
be
an
impermissible
burden
on
the
defendant.
mr.
steven
a.
morley
it
would
be
an
impermissible
burden
on
the
fifth
amendment
for
him
to
increase
the
sentence.
mr.
steven
a.
morley
certainly.
mr.
steven
a.
morley
i
think
a
judge
could
deny
acceptance
of
responsibility
in
those
terms
because
of
the
breadth
of
the
sentencing
guideline
on
acceptance
of
responsibility,
which
includes
all
the
conduct
within
the
offense.
mr.
steven
a.
morley
that's
a
burden
on
the
fifth
amendment,
but
it's
not
in
the
same
sense,
because
the
defendant
in
that
case
is
required
to
make
an
affirmative
choice.
he
is
to
come
forward
and
say,
i
want
something
from
this
court.
i
want
acceptance
of
responsibility.
mr.
steven
a.
morley
yes.
mr.
steven
a.
morley
yes.
mr.
steven
a.
morley
he's
supposed
to
take
the
evidence.
mr.
steven
a.
morley
well,
the
pre-sentence
report
is
done
subsequent
to
the--
mr.
steven
a.
morley
--he's
supposed
to
evaluate
the
evidence
that
comes
before
him.
mr.
steven
a.
morley
it
can.
mr.
steven
a.
morley
it
can
include
that.
mr.
steven
a.
morley
i
think
he
has
the
discretion
to
do
that.
mr.
steven
a.
morley
can
i
retract
my
answer?
mr.
steven
a.
morley
i
think
the
true
answer
is,
at
a
sentencing
hearing
is
a
separate
stand-apart
hearing,
and
the
sentencing--
mr.
steven
a.
morley
--he
should
not
take
into
account
what
he
heard
at
the
plea.
he
should
take
into
account
the
evidence
that's
presented
to
him
as
a
separate
stand-apart
sentencing
hearing.
mr.
steven
a.
morley
yes,
a
judge
can
take
that
into
consideration.
mr.
steven
a.
morley
well,
in
that
sense
we
are
taking...
we
are
taking
that
differently.
in
that
sense
that
in
this
case
what
the
judge
said
is,
i'm
taking
this
against
you,
i'm
drawing
a
negative
inference,
and
if
i'm
wrong,
the
appellate
courts
will
send
it
back
to
me
and
i'll
take
another
look
at
the
credibility
of
the
witnesses
who
testified
against
you.
mr.
steven
a.
morley
he
could
certainly
have
done
that,
and
said
based
on
what's
before
me,
the
government
has
met
its
burden
of
proof.
mr.
steven
a.
morley
it
is
a
fine
line,
but
in
this
case,
what
the
court
did
was,
take
a
negative
inference
against
my
client,
use
that
and
fashion
it
as
part
of
her
sentence,
and
expressly
say,
i'll
reevaluate
the
credibility
of
those
witnesses
if
i'm
wrong.
mr.
steven
a.
morley
if
the
waiver
was--
mr.
steven
a.
morley
--it's
complete...
yes,
it
is
complete
at
that
point.
