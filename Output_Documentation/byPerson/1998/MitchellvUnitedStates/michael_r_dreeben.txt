mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
a
plea
of
guilty
is
an
admission
of
a
crime,
and
therefore
inherently
constitutes
self-incrimination.
the
effect
of
a
guilty
plea
that
has
been
entered
by
a
court
is
therefore
to
waive
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination
with
respect
to
the
conduct
underlying
the
charge
to
which
the
defendant
has
admitted,
and
it
follows
from
that
that
a
court
may
at
sentencing
draw
an
adverse
inference
from
the
defendant's
failure
to
amplify
and
explain
the
conduct
in
which
she
engaged
that
underlies
the
crime.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
yes,
justice
kennedy,
under
the
principle--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--i
think
that
under
the
waiver
analysis
of
a
guilty
plea
the
judge
could
do
that
at
least
as
to
the
events
that
underlie
the
very
count
of
conviction
to
which
the
defendant
has
admitted
guilt.
that--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--that's
the
majority
rule.
there
is
at
least
one
decision
of
this--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--that's
right.
the
petitioner
is
attempting
to
construct
two
wholly
separate
proceedings
and
apply
a
rule
that
has
developed
in
the
lower
courts
that
says
that
a
waiver
of
the
fifth
amendment
is
applicable
only
for
one
proceeding.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
she
did.
and
that--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--that's
true,
but
that's
not--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--no,
i
don't
think
that
it
changes
it,
justice
o'connor.
she
didn't
reserve
any
privilege
against
self-incrimination
with
respect
to
the
conduct
that
she
admitted
to
committing
in
the
charged
conspiracy.
what
she
reserved
was
the
right
to
challenge
the
government's
proof
at
sentencing.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
our
position
is
that
she
inherently
waives
it
when
she
stands
before
the
court
and
says,
i
am
guilty
of
this
charged
offense.
i
admit
that
what
the
government
has
alleged
is
a
violation
of
the
law
that
i
committed.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
she
did
not.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
they
are
not
exactly
parallel,
justice
scalia,
and
i'm
not
suggesting
to
the
court
that
they
are
exactly
parallel.
what
occurs
when
this
court
has
examined
the
question
of
what
is
the
scope
of
a
waiver
when
a
defendant
takes
the
stand
is,
the
court
asks,
what
is
reasonably
going
to
be
furthered
as
a
policy
matter
by
saying
the
privilege
either
goes
this
far
or
it
ends,
and
it's
concluded
that
in
a
criminal
trial,
or
in
any
trial,
when
a
witness
testifies,
the
fairness
of
the
proceeding
requires
that
all
matters
that
are
relevant
to
cross-examination
be
deemed
to
be
waived.
in
this
context,
there
are
also
very
strong
reasons
to
consider
the
scope
of
the
waiver
to
be
at
the
minimum
all
of
the
conduct
that
is
bound
up
in
the
offense
to
which
the
defendant
pleads
guilty.
let
me
highlight
two
of
the
reasons,
apart
from
the
generic
reason
that
the
plea
of
guilty
itself
is
an
admission
that
the
defendant
has
engaged
in
conduct
that
violates
the
law.
the
first
is
that,
at
the
rule
11
colloquy,
the
judge
does
have
a
obligation
to
make
sure
that
the
defendant
is
fully
aware
of
the
facts
that
are
alleged
to
constitute
a
violation
of
the
law,
and
agrees
that
his
conduct
constitutes
that
violation.
to
perform
that
responsibility
adequately,
the
judge
must
have
the
authority
to
say,
look,
you
know,
i've
heard
what
this
charge
is,
it's,
for
example,
murder,
but
i
want
to
hear
you
tell
me
in
your
own
words
what
you
did.
now,
the
defendant
may
have
killed
a
person
with
a
gun,
and
the
defendant
may
also
be
a
felon,
and
thereby
admitting
that
the
defendant
had
a
gun
would
also
implicate
the
defendant
in
an
independent
crime,
a
section
922
violation.
now,
the
defendant
can't
realistically
say,
i'm
going
to
tell
you,
judge--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--well,
i
think
that--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--yes,
and
the
judge
at
that
point
could
say,
thank
you,
but
the
rule
11
colloquy
is
over.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
that's
right.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
and
that's
why
our
position
is,
it's
the
entry
and
acceptance
of
the
plea
that
effectuates
the
waiver
with
respect
to
the
conduct
underlying
the
plea.
the
defendant
who
wants
to
plead
guilty
and
spare
society
the
burden
of
a
trial,
and
perhaps
obtain
whatever
sentencing
benefits
flow
from
it,
must
be
prepared
to
come
and
tell
the
court
exactly
what
he
did
with
respect
to
the
charged
offense.
now,
the
first
distortion
is
therefore...
it's
going
to
undercut
the
judge's
ability
to
carry
out
the
rule
11
colloquy.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
i
think
the
question
that
the
court
has
to
answer
is,
what
are
the
necessary
and
inherent
consequences
of
the
guilty
plea,
and
i
think
that
in
answering
that
question,
the
court
ought
to
look
at
the
consequences
of
going
with
either
petitioner's
rule
or
with
our
rule.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
it
is.
that's
right.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
that's
right,
because
it
has
the
effect
of
prescribing
to
a
rule
that
all
the
defendant
has
to
do
is
come
up
and
to
say,
bare
bones,
i'm
going
to
say
each
element,
yes,
i
agree
to
that.
i
did
a
minimal
act
that
amounts--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--i
doubt
it,
justice
stevens.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
but
the
judge
also
doesn't
explain
to
the
defendant
that
upon
entry
of
a
final
judgment
of
conviction
you
may
be
subpoenaed
to
testify
at
a
grand
jury
with
respect
to
all
of
the
facts
and
details
surrounding
the
offense
to
which
you
pleaded
guilty.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
it
does
not,
because
the
purpose
of
the
colloquy
is
to
determine
whether
the
defendant
is
pleading
guilty
voluntarily.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
he
knows...
he
knows
certain
of
the
rights
that
he's
waiving,
and
certain
of
the
consequences
of
the
plea--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--justice
kennedy,
we
have
not
taken
the
position
that
the
defendant
can
be
required
to
testify
in
some
other
case.
there...
that
is
not
a
question--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--well--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--well,
the
normal
rule
that
has
been
evolving
in
the
lower
courts...
this
court
has
never
squarely
addressed
it...
is
that
waivers
of
fifth
amendment
rights
are
specific
to
the
case
in
which
they're
entered.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
that's
right,
and
i
don't
think
that
that's
inconsistent
with
the
rule
that
in
your
own
criminal
case,
when
you
have
come
forward
and
stood
before
the
court
and
said,
i'm
guilty,
you've
effectuated
a
full
waiver
of
the
conduct
underlying
that
transaction
in
your
own
case.
now,
the
other
distortion
that
can
occur
besides
the
distortion
of
the
rule
11
colloquy
is
that
it
gives
the
defendant
who
is
supposed
to
be
coming
forward
into
court
and
admitting
his
guilt
a
tremendous
incentive
to
minimize
his
culpability,
to
conceal
facts,
and
otherwise
to
hope
to
skate
by
during
the
rule
11
colloquy
with
an
absolutely
bare
bones
admission
of
what
he
has
done,
and
that
consequence
will
similarly
undermine
one
of
the
societal
functions
of
a
guilty
plea,
which
is
to
get
somebody
who's
willing
to
come
into
court
and
acknowledge
what
they
did
to--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--justice
ginsburg,
there
is
a
potentially
separate
concern
that
i
think
your
question
goes
to
about
adequacy
of
notice,
and
whether
you
were
required
to
legally
be
given
notice
of
every
right
that
would
be
waived
by
your
guilty
plea
before
the
waiver
can
be
complete.
i
don't
think
that
this
court's
cases
have
ever
said
that
any
right
that
might
be
waived
or
affected
by
a
guilty
plea
beyond
those
rights
that
are
specified
in
rule
11
needs
to
be
spelled
out.
if
there
were
a
case-specific
claim
of
entrapment,
as
your
honor
put
it,
that
would
be
a
separate
kind
of
due
process
claim.
it
does
not
go
to
the
fundamental
question
of
what
the
legal
effect
and
consequence
of
the
guilty
plea
is
with
respect
to
fifth
amendment
rights.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
i
think
that
that's
right.
i
think
that
what
she
reserved
was
the
right
to
say,
there
weren't
so
many
drugs.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
i
think
that
that
is
a
sufficiently--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--i
think
there
are
really
three.
one...
and
i
have
tried
to
cover
them,
justice
breyer,
so
i'm
not
suggesting
i
have
a
new
one.
one
is
that
i
think
it's
inherently
inconsistent
with
what
society
expects
in
a
guilty
plea,
that
a
defendant
will
come
forward,
acknowledge
the
conduct
that
they
did,
and
admit
that
it's
a
violation
of
the
law,
and
society
can
accept
that
as
a
method
of
resolution
of
a
criminal
case
rather
than
a
trial
because
there
is
a
value
to
having
somebody
acknowledge
it.
second
is
that
it
will
distort
rule
11
proceedings
by
limiting
the
judge's
ability
to
find
out
what
the
defendant
exactly
did.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
a
defendant--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--well,
if
the
defendant
had
the--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--justice
breyer,
if
the
defendant
has
a
fifth
amendment
right,
as
petitioner
contends,
then
the
defendant
will
say,
well,
i
don't
have
to
tell
you
those
kinds
of
details.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
it's
not
clear
to
me
on
what
basis
he
would
have
to
reject
it.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
yes.
that...
the
waiver
analysis
that
we
have
put
forward
suggests
that
at
least
as
to
the
facts
surrounding
the
conspiracy
to
which
she
admitted,
the
government
could
do
that,
or...
and
the
court
could
ask
her
to
testify.
there
is,
of
course,
a
narrower
basis
for
looking
at
this
particular
case,
because
that
did
not
happen
here.
what
happened
here
is
that
the
judge
had
a
substantial
amount
of
very
credible
evidence
before
him,
and
he
concluded,
the
government
has
given
me
this
much,
you
have
given
me
nothing.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
that's
right.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
that's
true.
i...
the
government
came
to
this
sentencing
prepared
to
prove
up
the
facts
that
supported
the
sentence.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
i
think,
chief
justice
rehnquist,
that
he
perceived
accurately
that
this
would
be
a
novel
question
of
law.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
it
gives
the
defendant
an
incentive
to
conceal
and
minimize
his
own
criminal
conduct,
so
instead
of
the
defendant
coming
into
court
and
being
willing
to
make
a
fair
statement
of
what
he
actually
did,
you
can
envision
a
defendant
thinking
quite
carefully
with
counsel
about
what
to
admit
and
what
to
attempt
to
get
by.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
no.
no,
it
does
not,
justice
breyer,
but
i
think
that
that's
consistent
with
our
view
that--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--well,
if
this
court
holds
that
there's
a
fifth
amendment
right
with
respect
to
sentencing
facts
that
do
not
relate
strictly
to
the
elements
of
the
offense
in
the
closest
way,
i
think
a
great
many
defendants
may--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--seek
to
exploit
that.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--well,
simply
because
it
will
deprive
the
sentencing
court
and
the
government
of
just
that
particular
piece
of
evidence
that
may
be
relevant
both
to
the
crime
and
sentencing.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
i
don't
have
any
objection,
justice
souter,
to
a
judge
accurately
informing
a
defendant
of
more
consequences
of
a
guilty
plea
than
are
required
by
the
current
version
of
rule
11.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
justice
souter,
that
amendment
of
rule
11,
or
the
rule
11
colloquy,
is
consistent
with
our
position
that
that's
the
effect
of
the
guilty
plea.
the
rule
11
in
its...
colloquy
in
its
current
form
should
not
drive
the
constitutional
conclusion
that
this
court
reaches.
if
the
guilty
plea
constitutes
a
waiver
of
the
privilege
with
respect
to
at
least
the
conduct
that
is
subsumed
in
the
count
of
conviction,
then
there's
nothing
wrong--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--that
is
true--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--that's
true,
justice
o'connor,
and
a
defendant
could
similarly
say,
i
want
to
enter
a
plea
of
guilty,
but
i
want
the
government
to
agree
that
it
will
shoulder
the
load
at
sentencing.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
that's
right.
this
then
will
establish--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--a
baseline
from
which
parties
can
enter
into
plea
agreements.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
chief
justice
rehnquist,
the
claim
would
be
made...
my
response
would
be
that
a
prosecutor
can
exert
considerable
pressure
on
a
defendant
to
waive
all
sorts
of
constitutional
rights
in
the
course
of
a
guilty
plea,
and
to
give
up
statutory
rights
as
well,
and
there's
nothing
inherently
unconstitutional
in
a
procedure
in
which
there
is
that
kind
of
give-and-take,
so
i
don't
think
that
affirming
the
view
that
petitioner
has
put
forward
would
preclude
the
government
from
trying
to
vary
it
by
contract.
but
by
the
same
token,
if
i
am
correct
that
the
plea
does
constitute
a
waiver,
nothing
would
prohibit
a
defendant
from
coming
in
to
the
prosecutor
and
saying,
i
am
willing
to
plead
guilty
and
spare
you
a
trial.
i
do
have
a
contest
about
the
sentencing
facts,
and
i
think
that
if
you've
got
the
evidence
you
ought
to
put
it
on.
i
don't
want
to
have
my
client
testify.
and
at
that
point
the
government
can
decide,
is
that
an
advantageous
plea,
or
a
disadvantageous
plea
agreement,
and
the
parties
can
set
that
ground
rule.
this
case
will
not
preclude
parties
from
achieving
legitimate
goals
that
they
might
wish
to
achieve
through
plea
agreements.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
justice
scalia--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--he
can
certainly
agree
that
he
is
not
going
to
call
witnesses,
or
put
on
certain
evidence.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
you
can't,
but
it
could
be
written
into
the
plea
agreement
that
if
the
court
doesn't
accept
that
plea
agreement
term,
it
will
reject
the
plea
agreement,
and
at
which
point
the
defendant
has
the
option
of
withdrawing
the
guilty
plea
and
can
go
back
to
ground
zero
with
the
prosecution
and
determine
what
the
most
advantageous
arrangement
really
is.
i
agree
with
you
that
a
federal
court
would
not
necessarily
and
inherently
be
bound
to
live
within
the
terms
of
the
parties'
arrangement,
but
the
federal
rules
of
criminal
procedure
provide
the
outcome
when
the
federal
court
concludes
that
it
will
not
do
that.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
justice
stevens,
presupposing
that
some
of
the
aggravating
factors
were
bound
up
in
the
very
conduct.
not
all
aggravating
factors
are.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
but
i...
yes.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
yes.
i...
that
would
ultimately
depend
on
whether
this
court
wanted
to
create
a
special
rule
for
capital
cases
that
would
be
distinct.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
yes.
the
logic
of
my
position
is
uniform
as
to
the
scope
of
the
waiver
that
is
achieved
at
sentencing.
there
are
various--
mr.

mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
it
would.
hardly
any...
none
to
my
knowledge...
capital
prosecutions
are
resolved
by
a
plea
of
guilty
to
the
offense
and
trial
on
sentencing.
it
is
theoretically
possible,
but
most
jurisdictions
put
the
question
to
the
trier
of
fact,
and
most
capital
defendants
will
take
their
chance
at
acquittal
or
conviction
of
a
lesser
offense
rather
than
plead
guilty
and
place
all
of
their
bets
in
the
sentencing
hearing.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
yes.
no,
that's
true,
and
at
that
point
they've
avoided
the
possibility
of
a
capital
hearing
altogether,
but
if
they
plead
guilty
to
a
capital
offense
and
then
stand
capital
sentencing,
that
would
be
quite
an
extraordinary
situation
in
my
experience.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
that
would
depend,
justice
ginsburg,
on
how
this
court
ultimately
resolved
the
question
of
what
an
alford
plea
really
is.
in
the
federal
system,
alford
pleas
are
extraordinarily
rare.
they
are
susceptible
of
being
characterized
as
a
plea
of
guilty,
which
the
court
seems
to
have
done
in
the
alford
case
itself,
but
they
are
also
susceptible
as
being
characterized
as
pleas
of
no
contest
in
which
the
defendant
is
admitting
that
these
charges
have
been
made,
the
facts
have
been
put
before
the
court,
and
i
believe
that
i'm
innocent,
but
i'm
going
to
allow
the
court
to
enter
judgment
against
me.
if
the
court
categorized
the
alford
plea
into
the
basket
of
guilty
pleas,
then
my
position
would
be
the
same.
it
is
the
legal
effect
of
the
guilty
plea
to
accomplish
a
waiver
of
the
privilege
within
the
zone
of
facts
encompassed
by
the
plea.
if
the
court
instead
viewed
this
as
no...
it's
really
more
like
a
plea
of
nolo
contendere
in
the
historical
sense,
then
i
don't
think
that
it
would
necessarily
amount
to
an
admission
of
commission
of
a
crime.
it's
really
consent
to
the
imposition
of
criminal
punishment.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
i
think
that
it's
possible
to
conclude
that
it
would
have
been
retained,
at
least
on
the
theory
that
we
have
articulated
before
the
court
today.
alford
pleas
are
so
anomalous
in
the
standard
run
of
guilty
pleas
that
it's
tricky
to
say
exactly
what
they
are,
but
the
normal
guilty
plea
unquestionably
is
a
full-fledged
waiver
of
the
privilege
against
compelled
self-incrimination.
indeed,
it
is
self-incrimination,
and
we
simply
take
the
view
that
once
one
comes
forward
to
the
court
to
do
that,
you
cannot
withhold
the
details
of
the
offense
to
which
you
have
pleaded
guilty.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
i
think,
justice
ginsburg,
that
the
third
circuit
went
back
and
forth
between
two
different
rationales.
one
rationale
begins
with
the
guilty
plea
analysis
that
we
have
stretched
out
in
this
court
to
articulate
more
factors.
the
other
part
of
the
third
circuit's
rationale
seems
to
be
the
notion
that
there
is
no
privilege
against
self-incrimination
with
respect
to
facts
that
can
serve
to
enhance
your
sentence.
the
logical
implication
of
that
position
is
broader
than
the
position
that
we've
taken
in
this
court.
the
logical
implication
of
that
position
is
that
a
defendant
who
goes
to
trial
and
does
not
take
the
stand
and
is
convicted
would
then
forfeit
any
fifth
amendment
privilege
with
respect
to
the
criminal
sentencing.
the
third
circuit
didn't
have
to
confront
that
situation,
and
i
do
not
know
what
the
third
circuit
would
have
answered
to
that
question,
but
there
are
enough
elements
in
the
third
circuit
decision
that
are
consistent
with
our
position,
so
i
think
it's
fair
to
say
that
this
was
and
is
a
guilty
plea
case.
the
essence...
thank
you.
