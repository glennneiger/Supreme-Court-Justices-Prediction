unknown
speaker
are
there
cases
that
tell
us
what
the
authority
and
discretion
of
the
trial
court
is
in
inquiring
as
to
the
basis
for
the...
the
factual
basis
for
the
plea?
at
the
plea
stage,
can
the
trial
judge
say,
now,
i
want
you
to
tell
me...
i'm
not
going
to
accept
your
plea.
i
want
you
to
tell
me
everything
that
you
did,
all
of
the
transactions,
and
if
you
don't
i'm
not
going
to
accept
your
plea.
can
the
trial
judge
say
that?
unknown
speaker
i'm
surprised
you
can
say...
suppose
you
have
three
police
officers,
uncontradicted
testimony,
overwhelming
proof
of
the
guilt,
and
they
testified,
and
the
criminal
defendant
says,
based
on
what
you've
heard
i
plead
guilty.
does
the
trial
judge
still
have
the
discretion
to
say,
i
want
you
to
tell
me
everything
that
happened
or
i
won't
accept
the
plea?
does
he
have
that...
i
would--
unknown
speaker
--but
once
he
does
that,
doesn't
his
discretion
end?
unknown
speaker
because
if
it
does,
it
seems
to
me
to
make
your
case
easier,
although
i
haven't
seen
cases
on
this.
unknown
speaker
in
a
plea
colloquy
you're
typically
told
you're
waiving
a
privilege
against
self-incrimination.
unknown
speaker
in
this
case,
judge
cahn
told
the
defendant
that,
i
think.
unknown
speaker
well,
you
know,
i
don't
know
that
one
would
parse
it
quite
that
strictly,
but
i...
that's
a
permissible
point
of
view,
certainly.
unknown
speaker
may
i...
i'm
sorry,
i
want
to
go
back
to
the
plea
colloquy
before
we
get
to
the
sentence.
would
you
explain
to
me
your
understanding
of
the
difference
between
the
waiver
that
is
involved
in
speaking
to
the
judge
during
the
plea
colloquy
and
the
waiver,
if
there
is
a
difference
in
the
waiver
that
a
defendant
makes
on
taking
the
stand
at
trial?
is
there
any
difference?
unknown
speaker
what
is
it?
unknown
speaker
well
now,
just
a
minute.
i
think
you
have
to
ask
enough
at
the
plea
colloquy
to
satisfy
yourself
as
the
trial
judge
that
the
facts
that
occurred
amount
to
a
commission
of
the
alleged
offense.
unknown
speaker
and
presumably
the
judge
could
have
asked
about
the
quantity
of
drugs.
unknown
speaker
what
was
the
statute
under
which
the
petitioner
was
charged
here?
unknown
speaker
and
you
conceive
that
the
quantity
of
the
drugs
is
not
an
element
of
the
offense
here.
unknown
speaker
and
would
it
be
an
abuse
of
discretion
for
the
judge
to
say,
i'm
not
going
to
take
the
guilty
plea
if
i
have
to
go
through
all
this
thing
on
sentencing.
you
have
to
tell
me
how
much
drugs
were
involved.
unknown
speaker
well
then,
the
privilege
you're
talking
about
is
not
as
important
as
i
thought
it
was
from
your
brief.
unknown
speaker
but
then
you're
just
making
it
a
later--
--well,
let
me--
--you
just
said
you
can
make
the
person
tell
sooner
but
you
can't
make
them
tell
later,
and
that
doesn't
make
a
whole
lot
of
sense.
well,
you
haven't
agreed
that
he
could
make
him
tell.
unknown
speaker
you're
just
saying
he
may
not
enter
the
plea
unless
you--
unknown
speaker
--well,
are
you
taking
the...
going
back
to
the
question
that
i
started
with
or,
it
seems
to
me
what
you're
saying
is
that
the
essential
difference
between
the
waiver
and
when
the
individual
stands
up
at
the
boykin
hearing
and
the
waiver
when
the
individual
takes
the
stand
is
that
the
only
waiver
that's
being
given
in
the
boykin
hearing
is
the
waiver
that
in
fact
is
made
with
each
individual
representation
of
fact
by
the
defendant
for
purposes
of
entering
the
plea,
and
that's
as
far
as
the
waiver
goes.
unknown
speaker
and
you're
saying
that
the
judge
can
condition
his
acceptance
of
the
plea
upon
the
defendant's
yielding
a
constitutional
right
that
the
judge
has
no
power
to
demand
that
he
yield.
doesn't
this
violate
the
doctrine
of
unconstitutional
conditions?
i'll
accept
this
plea,
but
only
if
you
give
up
your
constitutional
right
not
to
tell
me
this.
well,
you
give
up
the
constitutional
right
to
trial,
the
constitutional
right
to...
you
give
up
a
lot
of
constitutional
rights
when
you
plead
guilty,
don't
you?
unknown
speaker
well,
suppose...
suppose
the--
--well--
unknown
speaker
--no,
but
they
can.
it
seems
to
me
that
it...
and
i...
this
doesn't
happen
in
every
case,
of
course,
but
it
seems
to
me
that
it
may
very
well
be
open
to
a
judge
to
say
the
following
at
the
boykin
hearing.
number
1,
this
is
not
an
alford
plea.
you're
not
standing
here
saying,
look,
i
really
didn't
do
it,
but
you
know,
there's
a
reason
for
pleading
and
so
on,
so
your...
the
premise
of
your
plea
is
that
you
really
did
do
the
things
that
were
charged.
i,
the
judge,
sort
of
believe
that
truth
inheres
in
the
details,
and
i'm
not
going
to
be
satisfied
that
the
basis
is
being
given
for
this
upon
which
i'm
going
to
premise
a
knowing
and
voluntary
waiver
unless
you
go
beyond
conclusory
details
saying
yes,
i
had
drugs,
or
what-not.
i
want
the
details
to
assure
me
that
you're
really
telling
me
the
truth,
something
that's
worthy
of
my
belief.
certainly
that
is
within
a
judge's
discretion
at
the
plea
hearing.
unknown
speaker
then
it
would
be
a...
i
don't
want
to
cut
you
off,
but
you
then
say,
it
would
be
an
abuse
of
discretion
for
him--
unknown
speaker
--to
refuse
to
accept
the
plea
under
those
circumstances?
unknown
speaker
well,
but
he's
got
to
understand
the
consequences
to
which
he
is
legitimately
open
by
virtue
of
his
conduct,
and
that
involves
an
appreciation
not
only
of
theoretical
legal
consequences
but
of
the
actual
conduct,
too,
so
that's
the
justification
for
the
judge's
inquiry.
unknown
speaker
but--
unknown
speaker
--if
you
say,
mr.
morley,
that
what
happens
at
sentencing
is
not
really
an
element
of
the
offense
at
all,
then
why
is
it
subject
to
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination?
unknown
speaker
but
when
the
defendant
has
pleaded
guilty
in
a
case
and
actually
been
sentenced,
there's
no
question
that
particular
defendant
could
not
again
invoke
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination.
unknown
speaker
that
particular
element.
unknown
speaker
and
what
do
you
do
in
your
analysis,
if
you
say
this
is
subject
to
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination,
with
cases
like
brown
v.
walker
and
blau
v.
united
states,
which
says,
once
you've
started
to
say
something,
once
you've
started
to
tell
your
story
that
would
incriminate
you,
you
can't
stop
wherever
you
want
to?
unknown
speaker
i
don't
think
blau,
the
language
in
blau
doesn't
say
sense
of
fairness.
unknown
speaker
well,
how
do
you
know
that?
are
you
doing
some
mind-reading?
unknown
speaker
well
then,
how
do
you
know
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
let's
assume
there's
a
general
principle
that
you
can't
testify
as
to
part
of
a
subject
and
then
refuse
to
answer
further
questions
on
that
subject.
let's
assume
that's
a
general
rule,
which
i
thought
it
was
under
rogers
and
cases
that
the
chief
justice
cited.
suppose
at
the
sentencing
hearing
the
defendant
said,
well,
i
did
some
drugs,
or
whatever
this
statement
was,
would
that
be
a
waiver?
unknown
speaker
so
you
can
make
a
self-serving
statement?
unknown
speaker
and
then
rely
on
the
fifth
amendment
to
refuse
to
answer
questions
to
explore
the
accuracy
of
that
statement?
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask,
was
the
defendant
sworn
either
at
the
sentencing...
at
the
plea
colloquy
or
at
the
sentencing
hearing,
either
one?
unknown
speaker
and
at
the
plea
colloquy
was
when
she
said,
i
did
some
of
those
things?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
at
the
conclusion
of
the
sentencing.
you
were
appealing
a
little
earlier
to
what
you
saw
as
a
kind
of
a
judicial
fairness
rationale.
i
would
suppose
that
would
work
against
your
position
here,
because
when
someone
accepts...
makes
a
plea
agreement
the
defendant
is
making
the
agreement
because
it's
a
good
deal.
the...
supposedly
the
sentencing
risk
is
at
least
reduced
to
something
that
the
individual
can
accept,
and
the
individual
avoids,
in
fact,
the
very
messy
details
of
trial
which
can
affect
a
judge
a
great
deal
in
the
discretionary
sentence.
if
the
defendant
is
going
to
get
what
we
presume
is
a
comparatively
good
deal
by
making
the...
by
entering
the
plea
on
the
fairness
criterion
and
i
suppose
the
person
ought
to
be
forthcoming
about
the
specific
facts
that
might
bear
on
sentence
when
you
get
to
the
sentencing
hearing.
unknown
speaker
oh,
was
this
a...
this
was
an
open
plea--
unknown
speaker
--in
a
typical
case,
not
necessarily
yours,
where
there
was
a
specific
reservation,
but
in
a
typical
case
the
judge
has
to
satisfy
himself
that
there
is
a
factual
basis
for
the
plea
and,
in
doing
that,
i
guess
the
defendant
either
might
specifically
or
through
an
admission
to
someone
else's
recitation
of
the
facts
either
state
or
imply
that
it
was
a
small
amount
of
drugs
and,
in
fact,
when
we
get
to
the
sentencing
hearing
there's...
the
pre-sentence
report
says,
no,
no,
it
was
a
large
amount.
now,
the
defendant
there
would
have
really
made
a
suggestion
of
the
sort
that
in
a
trial
you
would
permit
cross-examination
about
and
i
guess
the
government's
concern
here
is
that
it
would
present
one
side
of
the
argument
in
any
such
case,
and
there
may
be
quite
a
few
such
cases,
and
so
it's
simpler
and
clearer
to
just
say,
a
waiver
is
a
waiver.
now,
i
want--
unknown
speaker
--right,
i--
unknown
speaker
--do
you
think
defendants,
by
and
large,
would
be
ill-advised
to
go
in
and
testify
if
the
judge
suggests
i
would
like
to
know
what
happened
here?
unknown
speaker
i
mean,
i'd
just
be
surprised--
unknown
speaker
--that
this
would
be
invoked
very
often.
unknown
speaker
it
might
be.
unknown
speaker
what
happens,
in
fact?
you
probably
know.
i
don't.
what...
are
there
many
cases
where,
when
we're
trying
to
sentence,
the
defendant
says,
by
the
way,
judge,
i'm
not
going
to
tell
you
my
side
of
the
story.
unknown
speaker
mr.
morley,
how
often
would
there
be
a
reservation
such
as
occurred
here
concerning
the
testimony
of
the
defendant
at
sentencing.
unknown
speaker
well,
there
are
any
number
of
statements
in
cases
from
this
court
to
the
effect
that
if
someone
enters
a
plea
of
guilty
they've
waived
any
fifth
amendment
protections.
unknown
speaker
but
that
was
a
death
penalty
case.
unknown
speaker
and
we
have
distinguished
the
sentencing
proceedings
in
death
penalty
cases.
unknown
speaker
we
have,
and
i...
and
we
held
it
to
that,
i
think.
unknown
speaker
there
was
no
guilty
plea
in
estelle,
was
there?
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
i
think
this
court
in
subsequent
cases
has
made
a
point
of
that.
unknown
speaker
are
you
saying
that--
--mr.
morley,
can
i
agree
with
you
that
there's
no
right
to
compel
a
person
who's
made
a
guilty
plea
to
testify
concerning
the
details
of
the
crime,
but
yet
not
agree
with
you
that
if
the
person
does
not
testify
about
the
details
at
sentencing,
the
judge
can
draw
a
negative
inference
from
failure
to
testify?
unknown
speaker
why?
unknown
speaker
how
recent
is
that
line
of
our
jurisprudence?
does
that
go
way
back,
or
is
that
relatively
new?
unknown
speaker
do
i
have
to
extend
that
demand
that
the
jury
do
what
it
is
very
difficult
for
any
reasonable
person
to
do,
do
i
have
to
extend
that
to
the
sentencing
proceeding
as
well?
unknown
speaker
but
we
have...
certainly
in
analogous
situations
we
have
drawn
a
different
kind
of
line.
in
callandra,
for
example,
we
said
we're
not
going
to
apply
some
of
the
exclusionary
rules
to
grand
jury
proceedings,
even
though
they
would
be
applied
to
court
proceedings.
unknown
speaker
one
could
draw
a
dichotomy
between
the
actual
trial,
where
the
elements
are
proved,
and
the
sentencing
proceeding.
unknown
speaker
only
if
you
think
it's
so
much
of
a
coercion
that
it
violates
the
fifth
amendment,
and
it
really
doesn't
seem
to
be
that
much
of
a
coercion.
it's
certainly
reasonable
for
the
sentencing
judge
to
say,
my
goodness,
i
don't
know
how
much
of
the
drug
she
had,
but
she's
unwilling
to
tell
me
how
much
she
had.
you
know,
that
makes
me
think
she
had
the
maximum
amount
that
they
assert
she
had.
that's
perfectly
reasonable--
unknown
speaker
--and
i
find
it
frankly
quite
fanciful
to
think
that
this
is
a
coercion
of
her...
drawing
this
rational
inference
is
a
coercion
of
her
fifth
amendment
right.
unknown
speaker
well,
can
the
judge
say,
i'm
not
going
to
draw
the
inference,
but
i
am
going
to
increase
the
sentence
for
noncooperation?
unknown
speaker
noncooperation
being
defined
as
nontestifying.
unknown
speaker
same
question
as
justice
scalia's.
unknown
speaker
how
about
acceptance
of
responsibility?
a
judge
can
give
credit,
as
i
understand
it,
at
sentencing
for
a
person--
unknown
speaker
--who
says,
your
honor,
i
did
it,
and
i
was
really
bad,
boy,
am
i
sorry,
and
this
is
what
i'm
going
to
do.
the
person
who
stands
silent
is
not
accepting
responsibility.
so
my
question
is
very
similar
to
justice
kennedy's,
but
putting
it
in
terms
of
something
affirmative
that
a
defendant
must
do
to
get
acceptance
of
responsibility
for--
unknown
speaker
--well,
that's
a
burden
on--
unknown
speaker
--that's
a
hard
issue--
unknown
speaker
--but
can
i
ask
a
practical
question
i'm
not
clear
on
yet?
you're
now
at
the
sentencing
stage.
unknown
speaker
and
the
judge
is
reading
the
pre-sentence
report,
and
it
gives
an
account
of
the
amount
of
the
drugs,
et
cetera,
it
really
is
at
variance
with
what
the
plea
colloquy
suggested,
implied,
said,
et
cetera.
all
right.
now...
so
the
judge
now...
is
the...
what's
the
judge
supposed
to
do
about
what
the
judge
has
learned
previously
in
the
plea
colloquy?
is
he
supposed
to
just
put
that
out
of
his
mind?
what's
he
supposed
to
do
about
that?
unknown
speaker
well,
does
that
count
as
part
of
the
evidence
or
not?
after
all,
that's
the
factual
basis
for
the
plea.
unknown
speaker
i
know
that,
but
he's
sitting
there,
and
he's
also
heard
what
is
called
the
factual
basis
for
the
plea,
and
so
my
question
is,
what
is
the
judge
supposed
to
do
about
that
set
of
facts
which
he
heard
earlier
during
the
rule
11
proceeding,
and
it
was
called
the
factual
basis
for
the
plea,
and
it
may
well
be
that
the
defendant
had
a
little
bit
to
contribute
there.
what's
the
judge
supposed
to
do
about
that
when
he's
considering
what
happened?
he
has
the
pre-sentence
report,
and
it's
different
in
respect
to
drugs
than
what
was
earlier
implied.
what's
he
supposed
to
do?
unknown
speaker
does
that
include
the
rule
11
part,
or
not?
unknown
speaker
fine.
unknown
speaker
i
thought
so,
too.
unknown
speaker
and
as
soon
as
you
say
that...
as
soon
as
you
say
that,
you
suddenly
realize
that
he
may
be
hearing
one
side
of
the
story
from
the
defendant
during
that
rule
11
colloquy,
when
it
was
just
barely
relevant,
so
we
didn't
go
into
it,
and
now
it
becomes
relevant,
and
he's
not
going
to
be
able
to
get
the
other
side
out
of
the
defendant,
or
he's
not
going
to
be
able
to
look
into
it
in
any
depth
because
the
defendant
won't
testify.
unknown
speaker
yes.
[laughter]
you
know
what
is
the
true--
unknown
speaker
--all
right,
so
your
answer
is,
he
should
not
take
into
account--
unknown
speaker
--okay,
but
it
seems
to
me--
--a
judge
can
certainly
at
a
sentencing
hearing
decide
on
the
basis
of
a
defendant's
conduct
and
testimony
at
the
trial
that
he
has
perjured
himself,
can't
he,
or
that
he's
lied?
unknown
speaker
and
can't
the
judge
also
say,
look,
i've
heard
from
these
people
at
the
sentencing
hearing
who
say
that
the
quantity
was
so
much.
you
haven't
taken
the
stand,
and
i
therefore
am
forced
to
decide
on
the
basis
of
the
only
evidence
that
i
have,
and
naturally
i
find
the
evidence
of
the
people
who
have
testified
more
persuasive
than
silence.
i
mean,
that's...
i
can't
help
that.
that
would
have
been
permissible.
so
that
if
that's
permissible,
then
the
only
thing
that
we're
dealing
with
here
is
the
judge's
form
of
words
when
he
said,
well,
i'm
going
to
hold
that
against
you.
unknown
speaker
but
he
could
have
said,
i'm
simply
going
to
draw
a
positive
inference
from
the
testimony
that
i
did
receive.
unknown
speaker
pretty
fine
line.
unknown
speaker
let
me
ask
you
one
question
that
may
or
may
not
go
to
something
peculiar
in
this
case.
you
pointed
out
that
at
the
rule
11
colloquy
the
judge
referred
to
the
waiver
of
the
fifth
amendment
right
as
being
the
waiver
of
the
right
to
silence
at
trial.
i
think
the
word,
at
trial,
was
used.
is
it
fair
to
say
that
once,
then,
the
defendant
says
yes,
is
it
fair
to
say
that
once
the
plea
is
taken,
the
waiver
is
as
complete
as
the
waiver
would
have
been
if
the
individual
had,
in
fact,
waived
at
trial?
unknown
speaker
he
says,
look,
your
waiving
the
same
right
you
would
have
to
waive
at
trial.
defendant
says
yes,
i
know
that.
judge
finishes
the
question,
says,
you
know,
i
make
the
appropriate
findings,
i
accept
the
plea.
at
that
point,
isn't
the
waiver
as
complete
as
it
would
have
been
if
the
individual
had,
in
fact,
taken
the
stand
at
trial?
it
wasn't
earlier
in
the
plea
colloquy,
but
once
the
plea
is
taken,
isn't
it
complete
then?
unknown
speaker
thank
you,
mr.
morley.
mr.
dreeben,
we'll
hear
from
you.
unknown
speaker
could
the
court
at
sentencing
say,
i'm
calling
the
defendant
to
the
stand,
and
then
just
examine
the
defendant?
unknown
speaker
i
think
you'd
have
to
say
that.
unknown
speaker
i
take
it
that...
and
this
is
just
to
explore
the
separate
proceeding,
stand-alone
proceeding
effort.
i
take
it
that
i'm
right...
correct
me
if
i'm
wrong...
if
the
target
of
the
investigation
testifies
at
the
grand
jury,
that's
not
a
waiver
if
there's
a
subsequent
indictment
and
a
trial.
unknown
speaker
and
i
take
it
what
the
petitioner
is
doing
here
is
to
say
that
same
sort
of
analogy
applies
between
the
plea
stage
rule
11
proceeding
and
the
sentencing.
unknown
speaker
well,
mr.
dreeben,
here
we
have
a
special
circumstance,
because
in
addition
to
the
guilty
plea
this
defendant
expressly
reserved
the
right
to
contest
the
amount
of
cocaine
that
she
was
responsible
for.
unknown
speaker
and
the
judge
said,
fine,
i'll
take
your
plea,
and
that's
the
deal
we're
going
to
make.
unknown
speaker
does
that
change
the
situation,
then,
on
the
waiver,
because
there
was
an
express
reservation
that
the
judge
apparently
went
along
with.
unknown
speaker
the
question
is
not
whether
she
reserved
it,
but
whether
she
waived
it.
unknown
speaker
that's
all
she
admitted.
she
didn't
admit,
you
know,
how
much
of
the
drug
she
had.
she
violated
this
statute,
but
she
didn't
admit
all
of
the
sentencing
elements.
unknown
speaker
so
why
must
she
admit
it
now?
i
do
not
see
the
parallel
that
you
seek
to
draw
between
taking
the
stand
in
a
criminal
trial
at
the
guilt
stage,
and
whereupon
you
can
be
examined
about
anything
related
to
the
crime,
and
this
situation,
because
where
a
person
takes
a
stand
in
a
criminal
trial,
that
person
is
using
his
or
her
testimony
as
a
sword,
attacking
the
government
with
it.
whereas,
where
the
person
has
pleaded
guilty,
the
person
is
not
using
his
testimony...
in
fact,
he's
using...
not
only
is
it
a
shield,
he's
using
it
as
a
sword
against
himself,
and
you're
saying
he
has
to
push
the
sword
in
further
than
he
has
agreed
to.
it
seems
to
me
they're
totally
different
situations,
and
i
do
understand
why
when
a
person
takes
the
stand
the
prosecution
ought
to
be
able
to
get
everything
out
of
them,
but
where
the
person
has
pleaded
guilty,
i
don't
know
why
the
prosecution
must
have
a
right
to
insist
that
that
person
plunge
the
sword
in
still
further.
the
two
situations
are
not
parallel.
unknown
speaker
oh,
he
can't
realistically,
but
legally
he
has
the
right
to
say
to
the
judge,
the
reason
i'm
not
going
to
tell
you
more
is,
it
may
incriminate
me
in
another
offense.
he
could
legally
do
that.
unknown
speaker
could
he
not?
unknown
speaker
i'm
going
to
take...
accept
your
plea.
unknown
speaker
that's
right.
unknown
speaker
wait.
i
haven't
followed
you
this
far.
you
want
to
go
further.
i
understand
why
the
judge
can
insist
that
the
defendant
say
this
or
else
not
enter
the
rule
11
order,
but
i
don't
understand
why,
if
he
hasn't
asked
the
defendant
to
come
out
with
it
and
enters
the
rule
11
order,
it
amounts
to
a
voluntary
agreement
to
give
up
this
information
by
the
defendant.
unknown
speaker
and
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
rule
11
situation,
it
seems
to
me.
all
we
have
to
ask
ourselves
are,
what
are
the
necessary
consequences
of
the
guilty
plea,
and
it
seems
to
be
perfectly
reasonable
to
say,
i
agree
that
i'm
guilty
of
the
crime,
and
i
say
nothing
about
what
the
various
sentencing
factors
happen
to
be.
and
your
position,
mr.
dreeben,
would
be
exactly
the
same
no
matter
what
happened
at
the
rule
11
proceeding--
unknown
speaker
--as
i
understand
it.
you'd
say
it's
inherent
in
the
guilty
plea.
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
in
that
connection,
mr....
either
in
this
rule
11
colloquy
where
the
judge
is
very
careful
on
page
45
to
state
the
nature
of
the
waiver...
you
give
up
your
right
at
trial
to
remain
silent.
he
did
not
go
on
and
say,
you
also
will
not
have
a
right
to
remain
silent
if
there's
a
controversy
about
amount
at
the
sentencing
hearing.
in
your
experience,
has
there
ever
been
a
rule
11
colloquy
when
the
judge
explained
to
him
the
theory
the
government
is
now
espousing?
unknown
speaker
i
do,
too.
unknown
speaker
no,
but
this
is
a
routine
sequence.
you
first
have
the
rule
11,
and
later
you
have
a
sentencing
hearing,
and
if
your
position
is
correct,
it
would
seem
to
me
that
the
ordinary
colloquy
ought
to
include
an
explanation
of
this
consequence,
which
it
doesn't.
unknown
speaker
and
knows
what
rights
he's
waiving,
because
that's
why
you
have
this
paragraph
in
here.
unknown
speaker
well,
suppose
you
have
this
sequence,
rule
11
hearing,
guilty
plea.
then
the
defendant
is
subpoenaed
by
the
government
to
testify
in
another
related
criminal
case.
his
sentencing
hasn't
occurred
yet,
and
at
sentencing
there's
going
to
be
a
big
problem
with
contesting
the
amount
of
drugs.
under
your
view,
i
take
it
the
government
can
require
the
defendant
to
testify
about
everything
relating
to
the
transaction,
even
though
his
sentencing
is
pending.
unknown
speaker
well,
if
there...
if
he
has
no
fifth
amendment
right--
unknown
speaker
--and
if
it's
waived,
what's
the
basis
for
his
declining?
unknown
speaker
ah,
so
now
this
is
just
a
limited
waiver
we're
talking
about
that's
implied
from
your
guilty
plea.
unknown
speaker
but
mr.
dreeben,
that's
so
far
from
this
case,
where
she
said,
i
don't...
i
do
want
to
contest
the
amount
of
drugs,
and
the
judge
said,
fine,
we'll
leave
that
over.
i
think
from
what
she
was
told,
one
is,
you
are
waiving
any
right
that
you
would
have
had
if
you
stood
trial,
and
fine,
you
can
contest
at
sentencing
the
amount.
there
seems
to
be
close
to
an
element
of
a
trap
for
the
unwary
there,
and
if
the
purpose
of
the
rule
11
colloquy...
i
thought
the
purpose
of
it
was
to
make
sure
the
defendant
is
informed
and
uncoerced.
here,
she
is
certainly
not
informed,
because
from
what
was
told
to
her
the
reasonable
inference
is,
okay,
the
judge
told
me
i
can
contest
the
amount
of
drugs
at
sentencing,
and
all
he
said
about
the
fifth
amendment
was,
trial.
unknown
speaker
well,
frankly,
if
i
were
the
trial
judge
and
i
heard
her
say,
i
reserve
the
right
to
contest
the
amount
of
the
drugs,
i
would
have
thought
she
intended
to
come
up
and
testify
at
the
sentencing
proceeding
and
say,
no,
i
only
had,
you
know,
the
lesser
amount
of
the
drugs.
i
don't
know
that
he
was
put
on
notice
that
she
reserved
the
right
not
to
say
anything.
to
the
contrary.
unknown
speaker
but
as
long
as
she
reserved
it,
as
long
as...
we're
talking
about
something,
a
fact
that
she
says
is
in
dispute,
and
she...
it's
not
an
element
of
the
crime,
so
it
really
doesn't
have
to
do
with
the
factual
basis
for
the
plea,
and
i
take
it
it's
also
the
case
that
in
the
later
sentencing
hearing
what
she
said
about
this
at
the
plea,
since
it
didn't
concern
an
element
of
the
crime,
is
really
beside
the
point.
i
mean...
all
right.
so
given
that,
you
were
about
to
list,
and
maybe
you
were
doing
it,
the
bad
consequences
that
would
flow
from
accepting
petitioner's
view,
what
are
they?
so
far
i've
heard
you
say,
well,
we
couldn't
go
into
the
sentence
in
great
detail,
we
wouldn't
find
out
all
the
facts,
and
that's
true.
of
course
that's
true.
that's
also
true
when
he
goes
to
trial
and
doesn't
waive
anything.
i
mean,
it's
always
true
if
you
have
a
fifth
amendment
right,
so
is
there
any
other
bad
consequence
that
would
flow
from
accepting
his
view?
i
mean,
i
absolutely
agree
with
you
that
a
judge
couldn't
go
into...
by
definition
couldn't
go
and
find
out
from
the
person
who's
asserting
the
right
what
happened,
but
i
think
that's
true
whether
they
plead
guilty
or
not.
unknown
speaker
is
there
any
other...
is
there
any
other
bad
thing
that
would
flow
from
accepting
his
view
of
the
case?
unknown
speaker
right.
he
says,
you
know,
you'd
better
tell
me
what
you
did.
i
don't
know
that
there's
a
factual
basis
for
this
plea.
please
tell
me.
well,
i
can't
imagine
a
defendant
under
those
circumstances
who
wants
to
plead
guilty
not
telling
him.
unknown
speaker
i
mean,
the
defendant
might
say,
okay,
forget
it,
i'll
go
to
trial,
but--
unknown
speaker
--if
the
judge
says
please
tell
me,
i
mean,
she's
going
to
tell
him.
unknown
speaker
fine,
he
says,
and
i
don't
have
to
accept
your...
i
don't
have
to
accept
your
guilty
plea.
unknown
speaker
i
don't
have
the
adequate
factual
basis
here
under
(f),
11(f)
or
whatever,
11...
you
know.
11(f),
is
it,
whatever.
may
i
ask
you,
on
the
facts
of
this
case,
where
the
woman
said,
i
want
to
contest
the
amount,
and
that
implied
to
the
judge
she
probably
would
be
going
to
get
on
the
stand
and
testify,
supposing
at
the
sentencing
hearing
the
probation...
the
pre-sentence
report
said,
we've
looked
at
the
evidence
as
best
we
can,
we
thought
we
had
some
reliable
witnesses
who
would
testify
to
x
amount
of
drugs,
but
our
witnesses
don't
stand
up,
we
don't
know
what
the
amount
was.
now,
is
it
your
view
that
the
prosecutor
could
say,
well,
we
can't
prove
it,
but
we'd
like
to
put
her
on
the
stand
and
cross-examine
her
and
see
if
we
can't
get
her
to
admit
it?
i
think
that's
your
view.
unknown
speaker
and
of
course,
as
justice
souter
said,
it's
a
very
fine
line.
the
judge
could
very
well
have
said,
the
evidence
is
uncontradicted,
i'll
accept
it,
and
i'll
enter
a
sentence
accordingly.
unknown
speaker
so
the
government...
you
don't
lose
a
lot
if
you
don't...
if
you
are
not
able
to
draw
the
negative
inference,
because
you
still
have
the
affirmative
evidence
of
amount
on
which
you
can
still
rely.
unknown
speaker
well,
one
senses
that
judge
cahn
actually
wanted
to
raise
an
issue
that
would
go
up
to
the
third
circuit
and
perhaps
here.
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
you
had
a
third...
you
said,
number
1,
it
distorts
the
societal
expectations,
number
2
it
distorts
the
rule
11
hearing,
and
number
3--
unknown
speaker
--all
right,
you
know...
you
may
or
may
not
know
this.
it's
just
a
factual,
empirical
matter,
but
it
still
comes
as
a
little
bit
of
a
surprise
to
me
that
many
defendants,
when
asked
by
the
judge
at
the
sentencing
hearing
as
to
a
contested
matter
what
their
side
of
the
story
was,
would
say,
i'm
not
going
to
tell
you.
i
mean,
does
that
happen
very
often?
unknown
speaker
all
right.
so
this
might
be
a
tempest
in
a
teapot.
unknown
speaker
why?
unknown
speaker
you
know,
but
the...
exploit
it.
they
would
be
losing
the
opportunity,
as
here,
the
woman
seemed
to
say,
which
i
think
justice
scalia
said,
that
maybe
she's
going
to
present
some
evidence
later
on.
unknown
speaker
she
wants
to
deny
what
the
pre-sentence
report's
saying.
do
you
think
they
will?
why
do
you
think
that?
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
why
isn't
the
answer
to
that
and
the
answer
to
the
distortion
of
the
rule
11
argument
that
the
judge
simply
has
to
make
it
clear
at
the
time
that
the
plea
is
taken
that
if
the
plea
is
accepted
the
right
is
being
waived
not
only
with
respect
to
testimony
at
trial,
which
was
the
term
he
used
here,
i
guess,
but
at
sentencing?
all
he's
got
to
do
is
add
a
couple
of
words,
and
there
will
then
be
no
question
about
the
scope
of
the
waiver.
it's
true
we
might
have
a
question
later
whether,
when
the
person
said,
well,
i
won't
waive
it
as
to
sentencing,
whether
the
judge
can
then
refuse
to
take
the
plea,
but
that's
unlikely,
too,
so
why
isn't
that
fairly
simple
answer
dispositive
of
your
concerns?
unknown
speaker
well,
he's
simply
making
explicit
to
a
lay
person
what
in
fact
is
being
done.
i
mean,
the
reason
for
the
boykin
hearing
is
to
make
sure
the
defendant
who
is
not
a
lawyer
knows
what
the
consequences
will
be,
and
all
you're
doing
if
you
add
the
reference
to
waiver
as
to
sentencing
hearing
is
just
being
complete,
whereas
under
the
colloquy
that
took
place
in
this
case
it
was
not
totally
complete
on
your
view.
unknown
speaker
well,
but
if
we
take
the
view
that
all
the
guilty
plea
does
under
a
colloquy
like
this
is
deal
with
the
elements
of
the
crime,
not
something
that's
purely
a
sentencing
factor,
i
can
envision
a
statute
where
the
quantity
is
an
element.
but
that
wasn't
this
one,
apparently,
and
under
those
circumstances,
i
guess
a
prosecutor
could
say
to
the
defendant,
we're
not
going
to
take
a
plea
unless
the
plea
makes
clear
that
at
sentencing
it's
a
waiver
of
any
fifth
amendment
privilege
that
you
might
want
to
assert
at
sentencing
as
well.
unknown
speaker
i
mean,
a
prosecutor
could
do
that.
unknown
speaker
well--
--yes,
but
you
could
say,
fine,
then
we
won't
agree.
unknown
speaker
end
of
story.
unknown
speaker
is
it
entirely
consensual?
i
mean,
if
the
petitioner
is
right
that
where
you
deal
separately
with
the
elements
of
a
crime,
you've
pleaded
guilty,
you
waive
the
plea
there,
but
you
don't
with
respect
to
sentencing,
then
can...
could
either
the
prosecutor
or
the
judge
simply
condition
their
acceptance
of
a
plea
on
a
further
waiver
without
being
charged
with
burdening
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination
such
as
we've
said
in
some
other
cases?
unknown
speaker
a
prosecutor
can
agree
that
a
certain
witness
will
not
appear
before
a
federal
judge?
unknown
speaker
a
prosecutor
can
sort
of
arrange
the
witness
list
for
a
federal
court,
then?
unknown
speaker
if
i
were
the
judge,
i
would
call
that
witness
myself,
the
witness
most
knowledgeable.
if
that
witness
has
no
constitutional
right
not
to
testify
on
the
point,
i
just
don't
see
how
you
could
guarantee
him
that
he
wouldn't
be
called.
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
one
other
question?
supposing
this
was
a
capital
case,
rather
than
this
kind
of
case,
and
the
defendant
wanted
to
make
exactly
the
same
arrangement.
he
would
plead
guilty
to
the
murder,
but
he
wanted
to
contest
the
aggravating
factors
at
sentencing,
and
the
same
colloquy
you
had
here.
you
take
it
he
would
not
have
a...
he
could
be
called
to
the
stand
and
cross-examined
about
aggravating
factors
because
he
pleaded
guilty
to
the
crime?
unknown
speaker
no.
unknown
speaker
you
would
draw
a
distinction
between
those
that
were
and
those
that
were
just
prior
criminal
record,
or
something
like
that?
unknown
speaker
the
logic
of
your
position
would
apply
to
that.
unknown
speaker
the
waiver
would
just
flow
from
the
plea
of
guilty.
unknown
speaker
but
not
the
nature
of
the
colloquy,
or
anything
like--
unknown
speaker
--oh,
we've
seen
a
fair
number
of
capital
cases
where
they
plead
guilty
and
hope
to
get
a
life
sentence.
unknown
speaker
what
would
be
the
result
if
this
had
been
an
alford
plea?
unknown
speaker
so
then
the
fifth
amendment
privilege
would
have
been
retained
at
the
sentencing.
unknown
speaker
are
you...
is
your
position
different
from
judge
slovener,
because
as
i
recall
she
didn't
put
rule
11
into
her
analysis
at
all.
