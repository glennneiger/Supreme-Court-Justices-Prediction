this
case
concerns
the
order
in
which
federal
courts
may
take
up
jurisdictional
issues
in
keeping
with
article
iii
of
the
constitution.
the
backsaw
for
today’s
decision
is
a
case
resolved
last
term,
steel
company
against
citizens
for
better
environment.
we
held
in
steel
company
that
a
federal
court
generally
must
satisfy
itself
of
its
jurisdiction
over
the
subject-matter
before
it
considers
the
merits
of
the
case.
we
now
address
this
question,
if
the
steel
company
instructs
jurisdiction
in
generally
proceeds
merits
in
the
dispositional
order
must
subject-matter
jurisdiction
similarly
proceed
personal
jurisdiction
on
the
decisional
line?
the
controversy
stems
from
a
norwegian
north
sea
gas
production
venture
respondents
are
three-related
companies.
i
will
call
them
collectively
marathon.
in
the
1980s
a
marathon
affiliate
contracted
to
sell
gas
from
a
certain
north
sea
field
to
a
group
of
european
buyers
including
petitioner
ruhrgas,
a
german
company.
in
1995,
marathon
filed
suit
in
texas
state
court
alleging
among
other
things
that
ruhrgas
had
defrauded
it
into
investing
money
in
the
norwegian
gas
production
venture.
ruhrgas
moved
the
case
from
the
texas
court
to
a
federal
district
court
and
then
moved
to
dismiss
the
complaint
asserting
that
it
has
no
ties
with
and
was
not
amenable
to
personal
jurisdiction
in
texas.
marathon
moved
to
remand
the
case
to
the
state
court
for
lack
of
federal
subject-matter
jurisdiction
urging
that
personal
jurisdiction
over
ruhrgas
to
be
left
open
for
the
texas
court
to
resolve.
the
district
court
concluding
that
marathon’s
complaint
did
not
present
circumstances
adequately
affiliating
ruhrgas
or
the
north
sea
gas
venture
with
texas
dismiss
the
case
for
lack
of
personal
jurisdiction.
the
court
of
appeals
from
the
fifth
circuit
sitting
en
banc
vacated
the
dismissal
order
and
removed
cases
the
court
held.
district
courts
must
be
satisfied
that
they
posses
subject-matter
jurisdiction
before
they
reach
challenges
to
personal
jurisdiction.
steel
company,
the
court
of
appeals
said,
counseled
against
skipping
over
subject-matter
jurisdiction
and
proceeding
directly
to
personal
jurisdiction.
we
reverse
and
cases
removed
from
state
court
to
federal
court
as
in
cases
originating
in
federal
court
there
is
no
unyielding
jurisdictional
hierarchy
requiring
the
federal
court
to
decide
whether
it
has
subject-matter
jurisdiction
before
taking
up
a
challenge,
the
personal
jurisdiction.
subject-matter
jurisdiction
should
come
first
to
fifth
circuit
region
because
it
is
nonwaivable
and
delimits
federal-court
power,
while
restrictions
on
a
court’s
jurisdiction
over
the
person
are
waivable
and
protect
not
state
prerogatives
but
private
rights.
that
was
the
argument
that
fifth
circuit
rejected.
the
two
jurisdictional
bedrocks,
subject-matter
jurisdiction
and
personal
jurisdiction
unquestionably
differ
in
character,
but
the
differences
do
not
mean
that
subject-matter
jurisdiction
is
ever
and
always
the
more
fundamental.
personal
jurisdiction
too
is
essential
for

that

is

marathon
urges
that
the
dignity
of
state
courts
is
at
stake
particularly
in
removed
cases
because

ruling
may
preclude
the
party
from
relitigating
that
issue
in
state
court.
our
opinion
notes
first
that

in
state
court
may
also
attend
a
federal
court’s
ruling
regarding
subject-matter
jurisdiction,
but
of
prime
importance
the
opinion
emphasizes
federal
and
state
courts
are
complimentary,
not
opposing
systems
for
administering
justice
a
state’s
dignitary
interest
as
consideration
when
a
district
court
exercises
discretion
in
the
case
of
this
order,
but
district
courts
may
also
consider
potentially
countervailing
concerns
of
judicial
economy
and
restraint.
in
this

straightforward
and

of
state
law
while
the
alleged
subject-matter
jurisdiction
raised

questions.
the
district
court
therefore
did
not
abuse
its
discretion
by
turning
directly
to
personal
jurisdiction.
the
opinion
of
the
court
is
unanimous.
