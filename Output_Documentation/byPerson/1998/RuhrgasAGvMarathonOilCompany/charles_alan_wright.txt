mr.
charles
alan
wright
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
presents
a
single
technical
jurisdictional
procedural
issue.
it
is
a
case
clearly
of
first
impression
here,
it
would
not
be
here
if
you
had
ruled
on
it
before,
but
despite
all
those
negatives,
i
submit
that
the
case
raises
important
issues
both
about
the
efficient
functioning
of
the
district
courts
and
about
the
proper
relation
between
courts
of
the
states
and
courts
of
the
united
states.
although
i
view
it
as
a
case
of
first
impression,
i
believe
that
a
line
of
cases
from
this
court
has
established
a
rule
of
law,
and
that
from
that
rule
of
law
we
can
find
the
answer
to
this
particular
issue,
and
the
rule
of
law
that
i
believe
your
cases
support
is
that
a
federal
court
may
make
a
wide
variety
of
decisions
prior
to
determining
whether
or
not
it
has
subject
matter
jurisdiction
of
the
case,
but
that
it
may
not
decide
any
issue
that
relates
to
the
merits
of
the
case.
we
believe
that
that
is
the
line
that
was
clearly
drawn
in
steel
co.
and
a
line
that
has
been
drawn
in
many
of
the
other
cases.
your
cases
say
that
the...
that
a
court
can
pass
on
the
issue
of
class
certification
without
deciding
whether
or
not
it
has
subject
matter
jurisdiction,
that
was
amchem,
of
course,
that
a
court
can
hold
that
a
lower
court
properly
exercised
its
discretion
in
declining
to
use
pendent
jurisdiction
without
deciding
whether
pendent
jurisdiction
existed
under
the
circumstances
of
the
case;
that
a
court
can
order
younger
abstention,
though
it
hasn't
decided
whether
it
has
subject
matter
jurisdiction,
that
was
ellis
v.
dyson;
that
a
court
can
rule
on
a
tag
bar
to
habeas
corpus
without
deciding
whether
there
was
a
prisoner
in
custody,
whether
there
is
a
final...
an
independent
adequate
judgment
reason
that
would
bar
review
by
any
federal
court.
we
believe
that
there
is
a
line
of
cases
that
provide
the
rule
by
which
this
case
is
to
be
measured.
then,
immediately
i
ask
myself,
should
there
be
an
exception
to
that
rule
of
law
where,
as
here,
the
issue
that
the
federal
court
decided,
without
deciding
whether
it
had
subject
matter
jurisdiction,
is
one
that
would
have
preclusive
effect
so
that
it
would
bar
a
state
court
from
making
an
independent
judgment
on
that?
i
submit
that
there
should
not
be
an
exception
to
the
usual
rule
on
those
grounds.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
yes,
sir.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
that
is
correct,
justice...
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
i...
justice
o'connor,
i'm
not
arguing
that
at
all.
my
submission
is
that
district
courts
ought
to
have
discretion
on
these
matters
and
decide
what
is
the
most
efficient
and
expeditious
way
to
dispose
of
the
case
so
long
only
as
they
do
not
get
into
the
merits
of
the
case
without
having
first
decided
that
they
have
subject
matter
jurisdiction
to
determine
the
merits.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
it
seems
to
me
you
could
well
write
the
opinion
that
way.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
if
i
were
writing
it
i
would
not
write
it
that
way.
i
would
write
it
simply
as
a
general
grant
of
discretion
to
the
district
courts
to
decide
which
issue
they
are
going
to
resolve
first.
i
would
not
impose
on
them
any
rigid
ordering,
but
as
long
as
the
ordering
is
simply
a
presumptive
priority
for
subject
matter
jurisdiction
i
think
that
could
be
perfectly--
mr.
charles
alan
wright
--i
wonder
if
i
could
answer
that
by
putting
to
you
a
hypothetical.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
i'm
surely
going
to
answer
the
hypothetical.
in
fact,
i
think
it's
self
answering.
i
hope
so.
let
us
suppose
that
in
this
case
our
only
argument
for
federal
jurisdiction
was
fraudulent
joinder
and
therefore
diversity,
an
argument
that
norge
should
not
have
been
a
party
and
then
there
would
have
been
complete
diversity,
and
that
the
basis
of
the
argument
for
fraudulent
joinder
is
that
even
if
there
was
personal
jurisdiction
with
regard
to
the
claims
of
marathon
there
was
not
personal
jurisdiction
with
regard
to
the
claims
of
norge.
and
let
us
suppose
that
the
federal
court
says
no,
you
were
wrong,
there
is
personal
jurisdiction
over
norge's
claim,
therefore
norge
is
properly
a
party,
therefore
there
is
no
diversity,
and
remands
the
case
to
the
state
court.
in
my
submission
we
could
not
then
come
in
and
seek
to
relitigate
the
issue
in
state
court
of
whether
there
was
personal
jurisdiction
of
the
claims
of
norge
against
us.
that
would
have
been
an
issue
determined
by
a
federal
court
and,
under
baldwin
v.
iowa
traveling
men,
we
would
be
barred
from
ever
raising
that
again.
that
would
mean
that
the
state
court
would
never
have
had
an
opportunity
to
pass
on
that
issue
of
personal
jurisdiction.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
of
course,
there's
always
a
federalism.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
well,
i
think
that
an
important
determinant
in
guiding
the
discretion
would
be
the
extent
to
which
this
would
require
the
federal
court
to
pass
on
difficult
issues
of
state
law,
the
extent
to
which
the
questions
of
personal
jurisdiction
are
intertwined
with
the
question
of
subject
matter
jurisdiction,
as,
indeed,
we
think
they
are
here,
that
all
those
would
be
relevant
considerations
in
deciding
which
issue
you
would
address
first.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
as
the
lawyer
for
ruhrgas,
i
would
say
we
are
very
happy
with
the
rule
announced
by
judge
higginbotham
and
the
dissenters
in
the
fifth
circuit.
if
i
were
sitting
in
my
office
writing
an
article,
i
would
say
that
there
ought
to
be
a
general
discretion.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
justice
ginsburg,
i
would
say
that
i
would
not
agree
with
them,
that
i
would
agree
on
the
great
importance
of
subject
matter
jurisdiction.
my
friends
do
me
the
honor
of
quoting
from
one
of
my
books
in
which
i
in
turn
quoted
ex
justice
curtis,
the
questions
of
jurisdiction
are
questions
of
power
as
between
the
central
government
and
the
states.
i
believe
that
deeply,
but
i
do
not
think
that
personal
jurisdiction
is
some
sort
of
second
class
issue.
it
is
an
issue
that
stems
from
the
constitution,
from
the
due
process
clause,
and
i
do
not
think
that
you
can
say
that
article
iii
takes
priority
over
the
fifth
amendment.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
i
imagined
that
i
recognized
the
words.
[laughter]
mr.
charles
alan
wright
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
that
is
exactly
my
submission.
i
could
give
another
example.
suppose
a
suit
in
state
court
asking
$50,000
in
damages
for
breach
of
contract
and
$1
million
in
punitive
damages.
the
case
goes
to
the
federal
court,
diversity
being
present.
the
federal
judge
says,
in
this
state,
the
state
law
does
not
allow
punitive
damages
in
a
breach
of
contract
action,
therefore
the
amount
in
controversy
is
not
satisfied,
therefore
i
am
remanding.
i
think
that
the
plaintiff
in
that
case
would
not
be
allowed
to
claim
in
state
court
that
it
could
get
punitive
damages.
obviously,
that
would
not
be
a
binding
declaration
as
to
what
the
law
of
that
state
was
to
be
for
the
future,
but
as
between
the
parties
to
that
litigation,
that
it
would
have
issue
preclusive
effect.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
justice
ginsburg,
i
don't
believe
that
the
party
would
be
allowed
in
state
court
to
challenge
the
preclusive
effect
of
the
judgment
by
saying
that
the
federal
court
lacked
jurisdiction
to
issue
that
judgment.
i
think
of
chico
county
as
a
case
that
you
can't
challenge
in
a
second
proceeding
whether
there
was
jurisdiction
in
the
first
proceeding.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
it
did,
yes.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
i'm
sorry,
justice
rehnquist,
i'm
not
prepared
on
that
case.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
well,
i
go
back,
justice
scalia,
to
i
think
it's
1803,
mccormick
v.
sullivan,
that
after
a
judgment
in
a
federal
court
you
cannot
resist
enforcement
on
the
grounds
that
in
fact
there
was
no
diversity.
diversity
was...
existence
of
diversity
was
not
challenged
in
the
first
proceeding,
but
your
court
held
that
a
final
judgment
is
not
to
be
attacked
for
lack
of
subject
matter
jurisdiction.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
it
was--
mr.
charles
alan
wright
--well,
i
don't
think
i
do.
[laughter]
i
like
judgments
of
federal
courts
to
stand
and
not
be
challenged
on
lack,
ground
of
lack
of
subject
matter
jurisdiction.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
well,
i'd,
as
i
suggested
a
moment
ago,
be
perfectly
content
with
saying
that
mostly
you
consider
it
first,
but
look
at
a
case
such
as
caterpillar--
mr.
charles
alan
wright
--why
is--
mr.
charles
alan
wright
--it
is
a
threshold
issue,
but
threshold
issues
not
always
have
to
be
considered
first.
that
is
what
specifically
was
said
in
lambrix
v.
singletary.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
yes.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
i
think
it
comes,
justice
breyer,
from
article
iii,
that
the
judicial
power
of
the
united
states
extends
only
to
certain
kinds
of
cases,
and
that
therefore
you
have
to
find
out
whether
this
is
a
case
that
is
within
your
jurisdiction,
but
you
have
to
do
that
before
you
decide
the
merits.
you
don't
have
to
do
that
before
you
decide
whether
to
refuse
class
certification,
and
you
don't
have
to
have
subject
matter
jurisdiction
from
the
beginning.
this
is
caterpillar
v.
lewis,
in
which
not
only
was
there
no
subject
matter
jurisdiction
at
the
time
the
case
was
commenced,
but
when
the
nondiverse
defendant
lane
was
dismissed,
it
would
have
been
too
late
to
remove
the
case
to
federal
court
if
the--
mr.
charles
alan
wright
--you
did,
exactly
right,
all
nine
of
you.
[laughter]
mr.
charles
alan
wright
i
agree
completely.
i'd
be
a
tenth
vote
for
that
proposition,
justice
ginsburg.
that
was
a
very
compelling
case,
but
i
think
that
the
considerations
of
efficiency
and
economy
on
which
you
expressly
relied
in
your
opinion
in
that
case
are
always
considerations
that
courts
have
to
take
into
account.
they
will
be
most
compelling,
as
in
your
case,
where
there
had
been
a
finished
trial,
but
that
doesn't
mean
that
they
do
not
exist
at
an
earlier
stage
in
the
litigation.
my
friends
undertake
to
dismiss
caterpillar
in
a
footnote
on
page
13
of
their
brief
by
saying
it
really
didn't
amount
to
anything;
it's
not
at
all
like
this
case,
where
there
is
a
continuing
lack
of
jurisdiction.
i
submit
that's
not
an
accurate
description
of
this
case.
there
is
no
lack
of
jurisdiction
in
this
case.
the
issue
simply
has
not
been
decided.
the
en
banc
court
expressly
vacated
so
much
of
the
panel
decision
as
it
passed
on
subject
matter
jurisdiction
and
remanded
the
case
for
the
district
court
to
decide
whether
it
had
subject
matter
jurisdiction.
that
decision
has
not
yet
been
made,
so
it
can't
be
looked
at
as
a
case
with
continuing
lack
of
subject
matter
jurisdiction
but
as
a
case
in
which
the
issue
of
subject
matter
jurisdiction
has
not
yet
been
determined.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
i
agree
entirely
with
that,
and
i
think
the
same
thing
is
true
in
amchem,
that
subject
matter
jurisdiction
never
has
to
be
decided
because
you
hold
that
the
class
should
not
have
been
certified,
and
so
you
don't
pass
on
the
both
constitutional
and
statutory
objections
to
subject
matter
jurisdiction
that
were
present
in
that
case.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i
will
reserve
my
time.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
let
me
first
speak
to
the
issue
that
was
just
discussed
about
burden
of
proof.
we
did
not
discuss
that
in
our
briefs.
we
didn't
think
it
important
enough.
the
fifth
circuit
in
fact
has
held
that
the
texas
burden
rule
is,
quote,
exactly
the
sort
of
state
procedural
accessory
that
federal
courts
are
not
bound
to
don
whenever
they
enter
the
diversity
courtroom.
that's
product
promotions
495
f.
2d
483.
the
texas
supreme
court
has
held
that
if
a
plaintiff
does
not
allege
that
defendant
has
performed
a
specific
act
in
texas,
then
the
mere
finding
or
allegation
that
defendant
is
a
nonresident
is
enough
to
carry
his
burden
of
proof,
so
i
really
think
the
burden
of
proof
issue
here
is
not
significant.
i
go
back
to
justice
kennedy's
question
to
my
friend:
suppose
that
pleading,
the
summons
and
complaint
are
served
on
norge...
as
i
pronounce
it,
and
others
have
different
pronunciations...
in
germany,
and
they
say,
well,
we've
not
been
in
texas,
we're
not
subject
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
courts
in
texas.
let
us
suppose
that
the
case
had
been
brought
in
federal
court.
if
the
position
for
which
marathon
has
been
arguing
here
is
right,
it
would
be
necessary
for
norge
to
come
in,
litigate
complicated
and
novel
matters
of
federal
subject
matter
jurisdiction,
when
it
says
we
have
an
easy
personal
jurisdiction
objection,
an
objection
that
is
constitutionally
raised.
and
what
i
think
highlights
the
illogicality
of
that
is
that,
as
we
know,
if
you
are
served
and
you
believe
that
you
are
not
subject
to
personal
jurisdiction
to
the
court
of
the
state,
you
can
simply
refuse
to
go
there,
do
nothing,
and
collaterally
attack
the
judgment.
if
you
go
there
as
in
baldwin
and
litigate
the
personal
jurisdiction
issue,
you
cannot
then
raise
it
in
an
enforcement
action,
but
if
you
simply
ignore
the
first
action,
you
can
then
challenge
any
judgment.
i
don't
think
that's
what
we
want
to
encourage
people
to
do.
we
don't
want
them
deciding
for
themselves
what
the
law
is
and
gambling
that
they
will
later
be
held
to
be
right.
we
want
them
to
go
into
court
and
present
their
objection
in
an
orderly
way.
but
if
my
defendant
comes
in
and
says,
i'm
not
subject
to
your
personal
jurisdiction,
madam
federal
judge,
it
seems
to
me
that
it
is
wrong
to
say
that
that
defendant
must
litigate
issues
of
federal
subject
matter
jurisdiction
rather
than
having
the
case
dismissed
because
there
is
no
in
personam
jurisdiction.
that,
of
course,
i'm
there
positing,
because
my
friend
mr.
hutchinson
says
his
rule
applies
across
the
board
to
all
cases,
original
and
removed,
and
in
an
original
jurisdiction
case
i
think
that
would
simply
be
an
intolerable
rule,
and
i
don't
think
that
it
has
much
more
logic
to
commend
it
when
it
is
in
a
case
that
is
in
the
federal
court
by
virtue
of
removal.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
well...
excuse
me.
justice
scalia,
i
think
that
the
federalism
component
becomes
more
significant
when
it
is
a
removed
case,
that
here
is
an
issue
that...
here
is
a
case
that
if
it
had
not
been
wrongly
taken
to
federal
court,
as
we
presuppose
a
federal
lack
of
subject
matter
jurisdiction,
that
the
state
court
would
get
to
decide
the
matter,
that
there
would
be
a
dignitary
interest
in
the
state
court
there.
so
i
think
yes,
that
is
an
element
that
has
to
be
taken
into
the
scales.
but
i
quoted,
at
page
23
of
my
opening
brief,
a
sentence
from
justice
black's
opinion
in
younger
v.
harris
that
has
for
years
been
my
mantra
with
regard
to
federalism,
that
it
means
neither
strict
obeisance
to
state's
rights,
nor
regarding
the
federal
government
as
in
control
of
everything.
it
regards...
it
requires
a
sensitive
recognition
of
the
interests
of
each
of
the
systems.
and
i
think
that
in
the
removal
cases
such
as
this
one,
that
the
efficiency
considerations
for
the
federal
court
outweigh
the
dignitary
interest
of
the
state
court
in
retaining
the
power
to
decide
the
issue.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i
thank
the
court.
