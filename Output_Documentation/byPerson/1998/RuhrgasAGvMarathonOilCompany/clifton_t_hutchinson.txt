mr.
clifton
t.
hutchinson
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
may
it
please
the
court:
what
petitioner
proposes
here
is
to
ignore
a
first
principle.
the
carefully
defined
and
limited
power
of
federal
courts.
efficiency
jurisdiction
is
wrong
for
three
reasons.
first,
it
violates
fundamental
constitutional
principles
allocating
judicial
power
between
the
states
and
the
federal
government;
second,
it
negates
congressional
policy
favoring
remand;
and
third,
and
ironically,
it's
inefficient.
federal
courts
can't
act
without
power.
that's--
mr.
clifton
t.
hutchinson
--in
amchem.
mr.
clifton
t.
hutchinson
the
abstention
cases,
justice
o'connor,
involve
situations
where
the
federalism
issues
aren't
raised.
there,
the
court
is
declining
jurisdiction
when
it
has
jurisdiction.
in
the
lambrix
case--
mr.
clifton
t.
hutchinson
--class
certification
is
a
different
issue,
justice
o'connor.
in
the
amchem
case,
what
the
court
said
is
that
the
certification
issue
was
a
logical
antecedent
to
a
determination
of
subject
matter
jurisdiction.
before
justiciability
could
be
analyzed
in
the
amchem
case,
which
was
the
issue
that
was
being
raised
by
one
segment
of
the
class,
the
court
had
to
determine
exactly
what
is
this
class
so
that
it
can
then
address
subject
matter
jurisdiction.
and
in
fact
i
think
amchem
is
a
very
good
illustration
of
efficiency
jurisdiction.
as
judge
becker
pointed
out,
that
was
a
wonderfully
efficient
case.
judge
becker
called
it
a
humongous
class
of
asbestos
cases,
but,
he
said,
the
court
can't
go
beyond
its
power,
and
that's
what
it
did
when
it
certified
these
cases.
he
said--
mr.
clifton
t.
hutchinson
--the
court
doesn't
have
the
power,
justice
o'connor,
to
decide
that
issue
until
it
determines
that
it
has
the
capacity
to
decide
the
case,
and
that
comes
from
the
fundamental
difference
between
subject
matter
jurisdiction--
mr.
clifton
t.
hutchinson
--justice
o'connor,
you
can...
i
think
there
are
hypotheticals
that
you
can
come
up
with
that
make
it
difficult
for
a
court
to
determine
subject
matter
jurisdiction.
i
think
that
is
rare.
i
think
professor
wright
himself
has
indicated
those
are
rare
situations.
mr.
clifton
t.
hutchinson
in
the
rare
case
the
court
has
to
undertake
whatever
procedures
it
has
to
to
resolve
whatever
antecedent
issues
it
has
to
in
order
to
get
to
that
nub
issue
of
subject
matter
jurisdiction,
and
i--
mr.
clifton
t.
hutchinson
--the
exceptions,
justice
o'connor,
are
those
which
have
been
established
in
the
cases,
for
example,
the
inherent
power
cases,
which
deal
with
the
court's
authority
to
manage
its
docket
and
to
manage
proceedings
before
it.
but
when
a
court
goes
beyond
that,
beyond
that
inherent
power
to
maintain
the
status
quo,
then
it
is
exceeding
its
power
under
article
iii,
and
if--
mr.
clifton
t.
hutchinson
--justice
scalia,
i
think
it
applies...
from
a
constitutional
standpoint
it
would
apply
across
the
board.
mr.
clifton
t.
hutchinson
yes,
justice
scalia,
i
would.
now,
in
the
removal
cases
there
are
some
factors
that
are
particularly
aggravating.
there
is
more
potential
for
abuse.
there
is
the
situation,
kind
of
an
anomalous
situation
that
a
defendant
has
removed
to
federal
court
claiming
subject
matter
jurisdiction
and
then,
as
in
this
case,
tells
the
district
judge,
i
have
removed
it
to
you
asserting
subject
matter
jurisdiction,
but
you
don't
even
have
to
address
it.
you
can
circumvent
it.
mr.
clifton
t.
hutchinson
insubstantiality
and
statutory
standing,
or
constitutional
standing.
mr.
clifton
t.
hutchinson
justice
stevens,
i
think
that
was
part
of
the
questions
that
were
discussed
at
some
length
in
the
steel
co.
case,
which
is
whether
you
can--
mr.
clifton
t.
hutchinson
--the
issue
of
what
type--
mr.
clifton
t.
hutchinson
--constitutional
versus
statutory
standing.
and
i
would
submit
to
the
court
in
one
sense
that's
two
sides
of
the
same
subject
matter
jurisdictional
coin,
and
that's
very
different
from
the
situation
we
have
here,
subject
matter
jurisdiction
and
the
power
of
the
court
and
the--
mr.
clifton
t.
hutchinson
--and
the
defense
of
the
party.
mr.
clifton
t.
hutchinson
what
is
to
be
said
to
that,
justice
scalia,
to
distinguish
it,
is
that
the
court
is
looking
at
subject
matter
jurisdiction.
it
may
be
applying
an
efficiency
factor.
mr.
clifton
t.
hutchinson
it
may
be.
mr.
clifton
t.
hutchinson
i
don't
quite
follow
that,
justice
souter.
the...
it
seems
to
me
the...
when
you're
saying
it's
insubstantial
you're
saying
it's
not
a
case
or
controversy
under
article
iii,
otherwise
you--
mr.
clifton
t.
hutchinson
--but
what
the
court
did
there
was
address
its
capacity
to
act,
its
power
to
act
over
the
case,
and
that's
very
different
from
the
individual
right--
mr.
clifton
t.
hutchinson
--the
court
has
to
have
power
before
it
can
act.
i
would
not.
mr.
clifton
t.
hutchinson
but
it
has
been
treated
hierarchically.
mr.
clifton
t.
hutchinson
in
the
rule
itself.
mr.
clifton
t.
hutchinson
some
of
the
defenses
are
waivable,
some
are
not.
some
must
be
decided
first.
mr.
clifton
t.
hutchinson
justice
scalia,
i
was
actually
referring
to
professor
wright's
treatise,
that
is
correct.
[laughter]
mr.
clifton
t.
hutchinson
it
is
not.
it
is
not,
justice
scalia,
but
i
thought
the...
some
of
the
language--
mr.
clifton
t.
hutchinson
--well,
what
i
was
referring
to,
justice
ginsburg,
was
rule
12(h),
which
indicates
that
a
defense
of
lack
of
jurisdiction
over
the
person,
improper
venue,
insufficiency
of
process,
all
those
things
can
be
waived,
but...
but
jurisdiction,
subject
matter
jurisdiction--
mr.
clifton
t.
hutchinson
--that
suggests,
though,
justice
ginsburg,
that...
that
a
court
has...
may
re...
pre
try
a
case
in
determining
remand,
and
that
would
be
against
congressional
policy,
that
if
all
doubts
are
to
be
resolved--
mr.
clifton
t.
hutchinson
--but
in
this
case
the
only
evidence
in
the
case
was
that
norge
owned
the
license,
and
that
that
license
was
damaged
by
the
acts
of
ruhrgas.
that
was
the
only
evidence
before
the
court.
it
was,
indeed,
a
simple
question.
the...
and
that's
the
irony
of
this
case,
is
that
the
subject
matter
jurisdiction
questions
were
easy.
mr.
clifton
t.
hutchinson
i
can't
speak
to
the
dissenters,
or
why
they
didn't
allow
the
panel--
mr.
clifton
t.
hutchinson
--yes,
justice
ginsburg,
the
majority
could
have
done
that,
but
they
decided
to
return
it
to
the
district
court,
and
i
don't
know
why.
mr.
clifton
t.
hutchinson
in
my
view,
yes,
justice
stevens,
that
the
court
first
must
satisfy
itself
it
has
article
iii
power
over
the
case
before
it
can
address
subject
matter
jurisdiction.
mr.
clifton
t.
hutchinson
courts
can
get
it
wrong,
justice
breyer,
but
the
fact
is
they
have
to
get
it;
they
have
to
determine--
mr.
clifton
t.
hutchinson
--they
have
to
make
that
determination--
mr.
clifton
t.
hutchinson
--because
of
article
iii
and
the
limited
power
of
the
federal
courts.
if
you
allow
the
court
to
exercise
power
before
it
determines
that
it
has
power,
then
it
has
exceeded--
mr.
clifton
t.
hutchinson
--because
congress
has
spoken
to
that
in
a
removal
case,
and
they've
said
if...
in
remand,
it
cannot
be
appealed,
and
i
think
that--
mr.
clifton
t.
hutchinson
--no,
justice
breyer.
efficiency
can
never
trump
constitutional
principles.
mr.
clifton
t.
hutchinson
it
is
an
individual
right,
and
that's
what
distinguishes
it
from
the
institutional
integrity
of
subject
matter
jurisdiction.
but
there's
a
practical
side
to
this
as
well,
because
in
this
context
it
is
the
defendant
who
makes
that
selection.
here,
defendant
has
said,
i
have
an
easy
question--
mr.
clifton
t.
hutchinson
--every
defendant
is
going
to
be
inconvenienced,
but
the
sanctity
of
the
federalism
system
must
take
priority
over
that
determination,
and
we're
not,
in
our
situation,
saying
that
personal
jurisdiction
is
not
important,
it
shouldn't
be
decided.
it
will
be.
but
in
the--
mr.
clifton
t.
hutchinson
--over
the
right
of
the
individual?
mr.
clifton
t.
hutchinson
i
would--
mr.
clifton
t.
hutchinson
--i
would
cite
those
cases
that
define
what
is
a
jurisdictional
prerequisite
for
the
case...
for
the
court
to
act.
the
zipes
case,
which
said
it
is
a
jurisdictional
prerequisite
if
it
can't
be
waived,
if
it
can't
be
established
by
estoppel.
i
would
cite
republic
national
bank
and
landgraf
for
the
principle
that
a
jurisdictional
prerequisite
speaks
to
the
power
of
the
court,
not
to
the
rights
of
the
parties.
i
would
cite
the
caspari
case
for
the
principle
that
a
jurisdictional
prerequisite
must
be
raised
by
the
court
sua
sponte.
none
of
those
apply
to
personal
jurisdiction.
some
of
the
points,
justice
o'connor,
you
raise
in
some
of
the
cases
that
you
mention,
the
lambrix
case,
for
example,
the
lambrix
case
dealt
with
the
teague
rule.
in
the
caspari
case,
that
very
issue
was
raised
by
this
court,
is
the
teague
rule
a
threshold
jurisdictional
issue,
and
the
court
said
no.
it's
waivable,
and
therefore
it
doesn't
rise
to
the
level
of
a
prerequisite
that
has
to
be
considered
by
the
court.
in
the
amchem
case,
the
class
certification
was
logically
antecedent
to
a
finding
of
subject
matter
jurisdiction.
in
the
inherent
power
cases,
such
as...
or
willy
actually
wasn't
an
inherent
power
case.
it
was
a
sanctions
case.
that
was
the
court's
power
to
manage
that
was
being
invoked,
and
there
are
limits
to
that
power,
as
this
court
found
in
the
catholic
conference
case.
in
the
catholic
conference
case
the
district
court
had
ordered
discovery,
and
it
was
a
contempt
motion
in
connection
with
that
discovery,
and
the
catholic
conference
case
said
the
discovery
sought
in
that
case
was
not
for
the
purpose
of
determining
subject
matter
jurisdiction.
therefore,
it
exceeded
the
court's
power.
mr.
clifton
t.
hutchinson
i'm
familiar
with
that
line
of
cases,
justice
stevens,
but
again
i
don't
think
that
rule
can
be
taken
this
far,
and
to
say
that
you...
the
court
goes
into
a
balancing--
mr.
clifton
t.
hutchinson
--you
have...
my...
yes,
justice
stevens.
mr.
clifton
t.
hutchinson
you
must
decide
it
first.
and
what
is
proposed
here--
mr.
clifton
t.
hutchinson
--justice
ginsburg,
in
a
removed
case,
the
courts
are
uniform
in
saying
that
doubts
should
be
resolved
in
favor
of
remand
in
order
to
follow
the
dictates
of
congress
in
the
removal
statutes,
and
as
this
court
recognized
in
the
international
primate,
these
are
mandatory
statutes,
and
that's
what
we
meant
in
our
brief,
that
when
there
are
doubts,
those
doubts
should
be
resolved
in
favor
of
remand.
mr.
clifton
t.
hutchinson
no,
justice
ginsburg,
but
there
are
different
types
of
cases
in
which
this
could
be
resolved.
for
example,
the
case
cited,
the
american
national
red
cross
case,
where
there
is
a
question
of
the
interpretation
of
a
1900
federal
charter
that
was
a
purely
legal
issue
that
had
been
resolved
differently
by
different
circuits.
there
it
may
be
a
difficult
question,
but
it's
not
a
question
of
resolving
factual
doubts
or
state
law
doubts,
it's
a
question
of
looking
at
the
language
of
a
charter
and
interpreting
it.
in
this
case,
there
were
questions
of
state
law
intertwined
with
the
factual
situation,
intertwined
with
questions
of
the
constitutional
due
process,
so
the
court
had
to
address
factual
issues,
and
those
factual
issues
should
be
resolved
in
favor
of
remand.
mr.
clifton
t.
hutchinson
the
fifth
circuit
deferred
to
the
district
judge
to
make
that
decision
in
the
first
instance.
mr.
clifton
t.
hutchinson
but
they
could
have
decided
at
the
fifth
circuit.
they
sent
it
back
down.
i
don't
think
that
goes
against
what
we're
arguing
here
today.
mr.
clifton
t.
hutchinson
doubt
should
be
resolved
in
favor
of
remand.
mr.
clifton
t.
hutchinson
that's
not
what
it
means.
it
depends
on
the
question.
mr.
clifton
t.
hutchinson
she
should
have
remanded.
mr.
clifton
t.
hutchinson
after
deciding
subject
matter
jurisdiction,
because--
mr.
clifton
t.
hutchinson
--complicated
issues,
and
arbitration
where
there
was
no
arbitration
agreement,
and
the
very
first
filing
by
ruhrgas
was
that
there
was
no
such
agreement.
mr.
clifton
t.
hutchinson
the
fifth
circuit
dissenters
didn't
treat
it
that
way.
the
panel
did.
mr.
clifton
t.
hutchinson
they
sent
it
back
to
the
district
court
for
resolution.
and
i
don't
know
their
rationale
for
doing
that
rather
than
deciding
it
immediately,
but
it
is,
i
think,
an
easy
issue.
mr.
clifton
t.
hutchinson
no,
not
precisely
that
point,
justice
souter.
what
i'm
saying
is
that
they
may
decide
it
differently,
and--
mr.
clifton
t.
hutchinson
--yes.
yes.
mr.
clifton
t.
hutchinson
it
is
in
part,
but--
mr.
clifton
t.
hutchinson
--no,
but
the
burden
of
proof
is
different.
mr.
clifton
t.
hutchinson
the
burden
of
proof
is,
under
the
kawasaki
case
in
the
texas
supreme
court,
the
burden
of
proof
is
on
the
defendant
to
disprove
every
ground
of
personal
jurisdiction,
whereas
the
burden
of
proof
applied
in
federal
court
is,
the
burden
of
proof
is
on
the
plaintiff,
so
that's
one
difference.
mr.
clifton
t.
hutchinson
justice
ginsburg,
what
i
think
the
point
here
in
this
particular
case
is
that
the
issues
of
due
process
are
intertwined
with
state
law
and
with
the
factual
situation,
because
one
of
the
issues
in
the
due
process
argument
was,
under
the
texas
long
arm
statute
was,
was
there
a
tort
in
texas?
i
think
the
court
got
this
wrong,
but
the
issue
that
the
court
addressed
was,
was
there
a
completed
tortious
act
within
the
state
which
involved
an
analysis
of
tort
law
as
well
as
the
facts,
so
that--
mr.
clifton
t.
hutchinson
--thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
