unknown
speaker
mr.
wright,
the
majority
in
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case
reversed
the
district
court,
did
it
not?
unknown
speaker
and
the
dissenters
said
that
they
would
uphold...
that
they
would
affirm
the
district
court.
unknown
speaker
so
it
would
have
come
out
differently
in
the
district
court
if
the
dissenters'
views
had
prevailed.
unknown
speaker
mr.
wright,
you're
not
arguing
that
the
constitution
requires
one
approach
or
another,
are
you?
unknown
speaker
when
we
write
the
opinion,
should
we
say
that
that
discretion
should
be
exercised
in
a
way
so
that
personal
jurisdiction
is
usually
decided
after
subject
matter
jurisdiction,
all
other
things
being
equal?
unknown
speaker
well,
should
we?
unknown
speaker
well,
is
there
not
a
value
to
federalism
in
deciding
subject
matter
jurisdiction
first
in
an
instance
like
this,
so
that
in
the
event
it
does
not
exist,
the
state
can
address
its
own
long
arm
statute?
unknown
speaker
so
long
as
you
answer
the
hypothetical
for
me.
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
well,
my
question
is
directed
to
this.
it
seems
that
you
give
no
weight
at
all
to
subject
matter
jurisdiction
as
having
some
sort
of
a
priority
over
personal
jurisdiction,
assuming
both
are
of
equivalent
difficulty.
and
isn't
there
a
federal
interest
in
allowing
the
state
in
an
instance
somewhat
like
this
to
have
the
first
opportunity
to
address
its
own
long
arm
statute...
assuming
there's
subject
matter
jurisdiction,
personal
jurisdiction...
in
the
district
court
or
questions
of
equal
difficulty?
unknown
speaker
because
you
indicate
there
is
some
discretion,
and
i
want
to
know
what
are
the
determinants
in
guiding
that
discretion?
unknown
speaker
you
go
further,
i
take
it,
than
the
dissenters
in
the
court
of
appeals.
as
i
understand
their
position,
it
was
the
presumptively
you
decide
the
subject
matter
jurisdiction
first,
but
it's
not
an
iron
clad
rule.
the
majority
said
it's
an
iron
clad
rule.
you
would
say
basically
just
leave
the
whole
thing
up
to
the
district
court.
unknown
speaker
and
yet
there
are
many
authors
who
have
distinguished
subject
matter
jurisdiction
as
being
the
most
basic
from
personal
jurisdiction,
which
those
authors
have
ranked
along
with,
say,
venue,
as
a
merely
dilatory
defense,
suggesting
that
there
is
a
hierarchy
here,
and
that
subject
matter
jurisdiction
is
the
more
basic.
unknown
speaker
i
was
quoting
your
text
when
i
used
the
word
dilatory.
unknown
speaker
i
take
it
the
point
of
your
hypothetical
was
that
sometimes
in
deciding
the
subject
matter
case,
whether
removal
was
proper,
a
district
judge
would
decide
a
host
of
state
law
questions,
personal
jurisdiction
questions,
all
kinds
of
other
questions.
unknown
speaker
all
right.
so
who's
to
say?
in
other
words,
if
your
interest
is
in
protecting
the
state,
who's
to
say?
it
depends
on
the
case.
is
that
the--
unknown
speaker
--mr.
wright,
as
to
the
preclusive
effect,
imagine
that
this
case
had
been
dismissed
for
want
of
personal
jurisdiction.
plaintiffs
begin
all
over
again
in
state
court,
and
they
say,
state
court,
the
first
thing
we
want
you
to
do
is
to
give
us
a
declaration
that
there
is
personal
jurisdiction,
and
the
reason
that
you're
not
bound
by
that
federal
court
is,
they
lacked
subject
matter
jurisdiction,
and
that
is
open
to
collateral
attack,
so
that
your
premise
about
the
preclusive
effect
is
wrong.
the
federal
court
would
be
accomplishing
nothing,
because
it
wouldn't
bind
the
state
court.
unknown
speaker
but
how
about
trinese
v.
sunshine
mining.
didn't
that
say
you
could
challenge
basis
of
jurisdiction?
unknown
speaker
that
you
could
relitigate
the
issue
of
jurisdiction
if
the
first
court
had
not
had
jurisdiction.
unknown
speaker
well,
i'm
not
sure
that's
right,
either.
the--
--but
all
of
those
cases,
in
any
event,
involved
a
court
that
reached
the
merits,
which
assumes
that
it
has
jurisdiction.
here
you
have
a
court
which
never
even
assumed
that
it
has
jurisdiction.
even
if
your
ordinary
rule
is
that
it
can't
be
attacked
collaterally
where
it
has
proceeded
with
an
affirmance
of
its
jurisdiction,
it's
proceeded
to
the
merits.
here
you
have
a
case
that
doesn't
fall
into
that
pattern.
you
have
a
case
where
even
the
court
issuing
it
says,
you
know,
i
don't
really
know
if
we
have
jurisdiction.
why
should
any
subject...
why
should
any
later
court...
it
decided
the
case
on
a
different
jurisdictional
issue,
and
therefore
never
spoke
to
its
own
subject
matter
jurisdiction.
unknown
speaker
but
here,
it
is
attacked
in
the
first
proceeding,
and
the
court
says,
well,
i
can
pick
and
choose.
i'm
not
going
to
deal
with
subject
matter
jurisdiction,
just
personal
jurisdiction.
the
state
then
says,
fine,
it's
never
been
litigated,
so
we
will
litigate
it
and
we
will
decide
for
the
first
time
that
there
was
no
subject
matter
jurisdiction
and
therefore
nothing
else
that
was
done
in
that
action
counts.
unknown
speaker
so
you
would
have
a
delightful,
quite
parallel
situation.
the
federal
court
will
have
decided
the
personal
jurisdiction
question
for
the
state
courts,
and
the
state
courts
will
have
decided
the
subject
matter
jurisdiction
question
for
the
federal
courts.
i
like
it.
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
but
why
isn't
that
exactly
the
respondents'
point?
they
say
this
does
show
the
intrusive
effect
on
the
state
court
system,
which
is
why
you
have
to
reach
subject
matter
jurisdiction,
they
say
always
first.
other
people
might
say
most
of
the
time
first.
you
seem
to
think
that
it
doesn't
make
much
difference.
unknown
speaker
but
why?
why
is
that?
unknown
speaker
why
should
we
usually
consider
subject
matter
jurisdiction
first?
unknown
speaker
what
is
the
source...
are
you
finished
answering
him?
unknown
speaker
what
is
the
source,
which
i've
often
wondered,
of
rules
of
law
that
say
you
always
have
to
decide
some
question
of
a
certain
kind
first,
for
example,
jurisdiction
before
merits?
i
mean,
i've
never
seen
anything
in
the
constitution
that
says
that.
i
don't
think
madison
wrote
about
it.
i
haven't
seen
a
statute
that
says
it.
is
it
from
the
brooding
omnipresence
in
the
sky?
[laughter]
i
mean,
where
does
it
come
from?
unknown
speaker
did
we
get
that
one
right,
in
your
view?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
wasn't
sure.
[laughter]
there
was
some
compelling
practical
consideration
in
that
case,
though,
was
there
not?
there
had
been
an
entire
trial,
and
after
the
trial
there
was
perfect
diversity.
it
would
have
been
i
think
strange
to
send
that
thing
back
to
start
from
square
1.
unknown
speaker
but
in
your
view
it
need
never
be
determined,
because
if
the
district
court
is
right
that
she
could
dismiss
for
personal
jurisdiction
and
that
binds
the
state
court,
then
subject
matter
jurisdiction
is
never
determined,
and
properly
so.
unknown
speaker
thank
you,
mr.
wright.
mr.
hutchinson,
we'll
hear
from
you.
unknown
speaker
well,
he...
mr.
wright
gave
several
examples
of
situations
where
courts,
apparently
properly
and
with
our
approval
in
some
instances,
have
decided
certain
things
other
than
subject
matter
jurisdiction
before
reaching
the
merits,
and
that
have
disposed
of
the
case
insofar
as
the
federal
court
is
concerned.
for
instance,
class
certification--
unknown
speaker
--as
we've
just
heard.
now,
what
about
those
cases?
and
he
recited
several
others,
pendent
jurisdiction,
younger
abstention
and
so
on.
unknown
speaker
well,
without
deciding,
in
some
instances,
like
class
certification,
without
even
deciding
whether
there's
subject
matter
jurisdiction.
unknown
speaker
what
if
the
subject
matter
jurisdiction
issue
turned
on
some
fact
finding
that
would
take
place
at
trial?
what's
the
court
going
to
do
then,
and
yet
here's
a
personal
jurisdiction
issue
just
sitting
there,
right
there,
that
the
court
could
decide.
what's
it
going
to
do?
unknown
speaker
so
you
say
it
would
have
to
go
to
trial
and
determine
these
factual
questions
despite
the
lack
of
personal
jurisdiction.
unknown
speaker
well,
what
if
we
have
the
rare
case?
unknown
speaker
in
other
words,
you
want
to
support
a
per
se
rule
no
matter
what.
you
have
no
exceptions,
in
your
view.
unknown
speaker
do
you
subscribe
to
that
even
when
it
is
not
a
removal
case,
even
when
the
alternative
is
not
the
same
case
proceeding
in
state
court,
or
is
it
just
in
these
removal
situations?
unknown
speaker
so
in
all
cases,
even
if
it's
not
a
removal
case,
where
there
is
a
personal
jurisdiction
issue
and
a
subject
matter
jurisdictional
issue,
you
would
say
that
the
federal
court
has
to
decide
the
subject
matter
jurisdiction
first,
or
else
it
has
no
authority
to
pronounce
on
personal
jurisdiction?
unknown
speaker
mr.
hutchinson--
--may
i
ask
you
this
question
about,
there
are
two
possible
bases
for
challenging
subject
matter
jurisdiction.
one
would
be
that
the
plaintiff
does
not
have
standing,
and
the
other
would
be
that
the
question
is
so
frivolous
that
it
doesn't
merit
review
at
all.
which
must
be
decided
first,
as
between
those
two?
unknown
speaker
constitutional
standing
and
insubstantiality.
unknown
speaker
no...
well,
okay.
unknown
speaker
there
the
court
would
have
a
choice,
you'd
say.
unknown
speaker
no,
the--
unknown
speaker
--but
justice
stevens
is
correct
that
we
do
use
what
you
might
call
an
efficiency
model
whenever
we
allow
a
dismissal
on
jurisdictional
grounds
because
the
federal
claim
is
frivolous.
i
mean,
you're...
without
looking
into
whether
there
is
subject
matter
jurisdiction
for...
you
know,
for
other
reasons,
we
just
say
the
federal
claim
is
frivolous,
and
as
steel
co.
makes
clear,
that
is
regarded
as
a
jurisdictional
dismissal.
what
is
there
to
be
said
for
that
except
efficiency?
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
it's
not
looking
to
article
iii
jurisdiction,
is
it?
it's
looking
to
the
statute,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
and
if
it
does
that,
and
if
that
is
proper,
then
in
effect
we've
already
decided
the
issue
as
to
whether
the
article
iii
point
always
and
under
all
circumstances
must
take
precedence.
unknown
speaker
well,
we
are
saying
in
the
first
instance
that
it's
a
frivolous
claim
in
relation
to
the
statute
under
which
it
is
brought.
that
may
be
a
basis
for
that
kind
of
an
efficiency
dismissal.
you're
not
saying...
excuse
me.
you're
not
saying
it's
not
a
case
or
controversy.
you're
saying
the
federal
basis
for
the
controversy
is
so
frivolous
there
was
merit
to
it.
the
example,
of
course,
is
the
census
case
we
just
decided.
there's
clearly
a
controversy
there,
but
avoiding
the
standing
issue
the
court
said,
well,
there's
no
merit
to
the
federal
claim,
so
it
dismissed
for
want
of
jurisdiction
without
reaching
a
jurisdictional
standing
question.
unknown
speaker
but
it
clearly
had
power
to
act
over
the
case.
it
could
have
decided
that
case
ahead
of
the
other
one.
it
surely
had
power
before
it
decided
the
first
case
to
decide
the
second
case.
you
wouldn't
deny
that.
unknown
speaker
well,
how
about
rule
12(b),
the
way
it
lists
the
various
defenses.
and
number
1,
of
course,
is
lack
of
jurisdiction
over
the
subject
matter;
number
2,
lack
of
jurisdiction
over
the
person,
and
it
goes
on,
and
that
has
not
been
treated
necessarily
as
a
hierarchical
thing.
it
seems
to
me
that
gives
the
courts
considerable
discretion
as
to
which
of
those
defenses
to
take
up
first.
unknown
speaker
has
it?
unknown
speaker
well--
unknown
speaker
--is
there
authority
in
case
law
to
that
effect?
unknown
speaker
is
that
res
judicata
here,
too?
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
mr.
hutchinson,
subject
matter
jurisdiction
is
preserved
and
it
can
be
raised
later
and
later,
so
it's
the
most
holy
one
in
that
respect.
but
there
is
no...
in
rule
12(b)
it
says,
the
only
economy
thing
in
the
rule
is,
if
you've
got
one,
try
to
bring
them
all
at
the
same
time,
except
if
you
leave
out
subject
matter
jurisdiction
and
one
or
two
others,
that
you
could
bring
those
up
later,
but
that's
all
that
rule
12(b)
says.
it
says,
here
are
these
pre
answer
defenses.
you
can
bring
these
up
by
motion
pre
answer,
and
you
should
if
you
bring
one,
bring
all
the
others
that
you
have
at
the
same
time,
except
there
are
certain
ones
that
you
don't...
that
are
saved
out
even
if
you
don't
bring
them.
that's
all
that
rule
12
says.
it
doesn't
say
that
you
must
bring
subject
matter
jurisdiction,
and
if
you
bring...
you
can't
bring
personal
jurisdiction.
it
doesn't
have
any
of
that
kind
of
ranking.
unknown
speaker
yes,
because
there's
always
jurisdiction
over
the
person
by
consent,
so
there's
that
difference,
but
how
does
it
relate
to
the
issue
that's
before
us,
and
you
have
been
talking
largely
in
the
abstract.
one
response
that
i
give
to
your
floodgates,
oh,
this
is
going
to
be
deceptive,
you're
predicating
rather
dumb
district
judges.
i
mean,
if
subject
matter
jurisdiction
is
phony,
the
district
judge
is
going
to
say,
get
rid
of
it.
send
it
back.
i
mean,
diversity,
is
there
diversity,
is
there
a
federal
question
on
the
face
of
the
complaint?
every...
i
thought
everybody
agreed
that
in
most
cases
the
lack
of
subject
matter
jurisdiction
is
clear,
so
you
don't
get
this
floodgate.
on
the
other
hand,
there
is
what
justice
o'connor
referred
to
as
a
rare
case,
which
i
looked
at
this
case
and
said,
well,
maybe
this
is
it,
in
that
this
party,
norge,
that's
alleged
to
be
fraudulently
joined
as
a
plaintiff,
that's
all
bound
up
with
the
merits
of
this
case,
so
you
may
not
be
able
to
sort
out
whether
there
was
a
sham
party
there
inserted
simply
to
block
diversity
until
you
get
to
the
merits
and
to
see
whether
this
norge
has
any
real
substance.
unknown
speaker
well,
let's
not
talk
about
policy,
about
specifics.
the
district
judge
said,
gee,
you
can't
create
an
absence
of
diversity
in
a
phony
way
any
more
than
you
can
create
with...
so
i
have
to
see
whether
there
is
really
diversity,
and
there
is
really
diversity
if
norge
doesn't
belong
in
this
litigation,
but
i
can't
tell
that
in
this
complicated
picture
till
we
get
some
kind
of
evidentiary
hearing.
unknown
speaker
well,
why
was
it
so
easy
when
the
fifth
circuit
itself,
the
majority
said,
gee,
we're
a
little
uncertain
about
that
panel
that
held
there
was
no
subject
matter
jurisdiction,
so
we
think
it
better
go
back
to
the
district
court
to
decide?
if
it
was
all
that
easy,
then
the
majority
of
the
court
of
appeals
surely
would
have
said,
yeah,
the
panel
got
it
right,
there's
no
subject
matter
jurisdiction.
but
they
took
the
extraordinary
step
of
saying,
we're
not
going
to
go
back
to
that
panel
decision.
we
want
the
district
judge
to
explore
all
these
questions,
so
if
you
were
right
about
it
was
easy,
then
why
didn't
the
panel
decision
stand?
unknown
speaker
i'm
talking
about
the
court,
the
majority,
not
the
dissenters.
the
court
could
have
said,
subject
matter
jurisdiction
has
to
be
handled
first,
and
the
panel
had
it
right,
there
was
no
subject
matter
jurisdiction.
isn't
that
what
the
three
judge
panel
decided,
that
there
was
no--
unknown
speaker
--may
i
ask,
just
to
understand
the
purity
of
your
position,
if
the
attack
on
personal
jurisdiction
had
been
insufficient
service
of
process
that
challenged
the
way
in
which
the
process...
would
you
still
say
that
could
not
be
decided
before
the
subject
matter
jurisdiction
issue?
in
other
words,
take
this
example.
supposing
you
have
attack
on
the
line
item
veto
case,
and
you
want
to
challenge
the
standing
of
the
plaintiff,
and
the
motion
to
dismiss
has
two
grounds,
one
he
doesn't
have
standing,
all
sorts
of...
secondly,
they
didn't
leave
the
summons
at
the
right
person
at
the...
wherever
it
should
have
been
left.
must
the
judge
decide
the
standing
issue
before
deciding
whether
service
was
proper,
in
your
view?
unknown
speaker
why,
just...
i've
always
wondered
this,
and
i'm
not
saying
there's
no
answer
to
it,
but
if
all
these
cases,
indeed,
where
it's
article
iii
power
versus
the
merits,
they
all
are
cases
in
which
it's
arguable
both
ways
whether
there
is
or
there
isn't
the
article
iii
power.
we're
only
talking
about
cases
in
which
a
district
judge
could
be
reasonably
uncertain.
so
if
this
is
so
holy
that
you
have
to
decide
the
question
of
power
first,
why
don't
you
have
to
have
an
immediate
appeal?
i
mean,
suppose
the
district
judge
were
to
get
it
wrong?
suppose,
horror
of
horrors,
he
were
to
think
there
is
article
iii
power
to
hear
this
case,
and
he's
wrong,
there
isn't;
why
is
he
permitted
to
go
ahead
with
the
merits
before
all
that's
finally
resolved
on
appeal,
perhaps
by
certiorari?
unknown
speaker
why?
unknown
speaker
why?
in
other
words,
why
is
it
that
it's
absolutely
incumbent
upon
the
district
judge
to
decide
every
difficult,
no
matter
how
difficult
question
of
article
iii
power
first,
including
yours
here,
before
going
on
to
another
easy
question,
that
it
isn't
incumbent
upon
the
system
to
decide
that
question
definitively
first?
unknown
speaker
exactly.
so
why
don't
we
have
to
have
appeals
and
certiorari,
and
really
get
it
solved
before
we
can
go
ahead
to
the
merits?
it's
a
constitutional
matter,
after
all.
why
don't
you
have
to
have
a
full
range
of
appeals
first?
unknown
speaker
of
course,
you're
not
giving
me
the
answer
correctly
that
i'm
looking
for,
which
is
it
would
be
totally
impractical.
now,
is
that
relevant?
unknown
speaker
but
there's
a
constitutional
principle
that
the
defendant's
asserting
with
reference
to
personal
jurisdiction
as
well.
suppose
you
have
somebody
who's
sued
in
texas,
who
says
i've
never
been
in
texas,
and
they
say,
oh,
you
negotiated
a
deal
there.
no,
i
did
that
in
san
francisco,
just
a
factual
determination.
was
he
ever
in
the
state
of
texas,
was
it
in
san
francisco
or
houston
where
he
had
the
one
deal
that
he
negotiated
in
the
united
states.
he's
from
overseas.
he
says,
you
have
no
constitutional
power
over
me.
but
you
would
say,
well,
we
want
you
to
go
to
houston
and
spend
hundreds
of
thousands
of
dollars
on
attorneys
litigating
subject
matter
jurisdiction
first.
that,
it
seems
to
me,
is
a
serious
abridgement
of
his
personal
right
not
to
be
subject
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court,
and
you
just
sweep
that
under
the
rug.
unknown
speaker
well,
but
of
course,
you
apply
your
rule
across
the
board,
even
to
nonremovable
cases,
so
in
my
hypothetical
you
were
sued
in
the
district
court
originally
and
you
still
say
he
has
to
submit
himself
to
the
subject
matter
jurisdiction
argument
by
hiring
attorneys
and
making
special
appearances
and
so
forth.
that's
not
the
rationale
of
the
statutes
that...
of
the
constitutional
provision
that
gives
you
protection
against
a
court
asserting
jurisdiction
over
you
if
it
has
no
personal
jurisdiction
under
the
fourteenth
amendment.
unknown
speaker
what
authority
do
you
have
for
the
standpoint
that
federalism
takes
precedence
over
personal
freedom?
unknown
speaker
what
case
do
i
cite
when
i
write
the
opinion
that
has
that--
unknown
speaker
--statement
in
it?
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
you
to
comment
on
another
consideration
that
occurs
to
me
as
i
think
about
the
problem.
sometimes
the
jurisdictional
issue,
like
the
standing
question,
will
raise
a
serious
constitutional
question,
whereas
the
personal
jurisdiction
may
merely
be
a
matter
of
fact,
or
interpreting
the
provision
of
state
law.
what
about
commenting
on
our
policy
of
trying
to
avoid
constitutional,
difficult
constitutional
questions
when
there's
another
principal
basis
for
decision
available?
unknown
speaker
you'd
say
that
even
though
there's
no
personal
jurisdiction
we
have
an
obligation
to
address
the
difficult
constitutional
question.
unknown
speaker
you
must
decide
it
before
you--
unknown
speaker
--then
you're
withdrawing
from
one
thing
you
said
in
your
brief,
which
i...
you
said,
if
the
subject
matter
jurisdiction
question
is
real
tough...
this
is
on
page
18,
19
of
your
brief,
if
it's
real
tough,
there's
a
simple
solution.
remand.
don't
decide
it.
so
you
said
i
think
twice
in
your
brief
that
subject
matter
jurisdiction
doesn't
have
to
be
decided
by
the
federal
court.
if
they
find
it
a
tough
question,
they
should
just
send
the
whole
thing
back
to
the
state
court.
i
think
you're...
are
you
modifying
that,
because
here
you
seem
to
say
they
must
decide
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
what
does
that
mean--
--i
don't
understand
what
you
just
said.
--specifically?
does
it
mean
that,
as
you
seem
to
imply
here,
the
court
says,
subject
matter
jurisdiction
case,
messy
here,
we
maybe
have
it,
maybe
we
don't,
but
resolve
that
doubts
in
favor
of
remand,
remand.
we
decide
nothing.
would
that
be
a
proper
way
for
a
federal
court
to
behave?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
don't
understand
what
you're
answering
me,
because
i
thought
from
your
brief
you
say
that
when
the
question
is
tough,
accordingly
where
the
subject
matter
jurisdiction
question
is
difficult,
the
federal
judiciary
already
has
devised
a
simple
but
effective
means
of
resolving
the
issue,
remand.
now,
that's
not
what
the
fifth
circuit
did.
it
sent
it
back
to
the
district
judge
and
they
said,
you
figure
out
the
subject
matter
jurisdiction
question.
but
according
to
what
you've
just
said,
if
the
principle
is
resolve
doubts
in
favor
of
remand,
then
the
fifth
circuit
en
banc
was
wrong
to
burden
the
district
judge
with
deciding
the
issue.
unknown
speaker
instructed
her
to
make
it.
it
didn't
defer
to
it.
she
said,
i
don't
want
to
make
it.
i
want
to
decide
personal
jurisdiction.
unknown
speaker
well,
what
you
just
argued
is
that
the
district
judge
should
have
resolved
the
doubts
in
favor
of
no
jurisdiction
and
just
remanded
without
any
decision,
saying
it's
a
tough
question,
a
tough
question,
we're
going
to
remand.
unknown
speaker
is
that
what
that
means?
does
doubt,
resolving
doubts
mean
it's
a
tough
question,
we
don't
have
to
decide
it,
we
resolve
the
doubt
in
favor
of
remand,
and
never
decide
subject
matter
jurisdiction?
unknown
speaker
well,
let's
take
this
question.
let's
take
the
three
bases
on
which
federal
jurisdiction
was
asserted
in
this
case.
what
should
the
district
judge
have
done?
unknown
speaker
after
deciding
what?
unknown
speaker
grappling
with
each
one
of
those
three
complicated--
unknown
speaker
--well,
you're
saying
it's
all
that
easy,
but
certainly
the
fifth
circuit
didn't
treat
it
that
way.
unknown
speaker
but
no...
the
fifth
circuit
en
banc
wiped
out
the
panel
decision,
which
held
there
was
no...
if
it
had
been
all
that
easy,
they
should
have
let
the
panel
decision
stand,
but
they
didn't.
the
majority
didn't
let
a
panel
decision
stand
that
said
there
is
no
subject
matter
jurisdiction.
they
said,
this
issue
needs
a
thorough
airing,
and
sent
it
back
to
the
district
court.
unknown
speaker
mr.
hutchinson,
to
me,
at
least,
your
position
is
a
little
stronger
when
you
confine
it
to
the
removal
situation.
i
want
to
be
clear
on
one
thing.
do
you
base
your
federalism
argument
simply
on
the
dignitary
interest
of
the
state
in
being
able
to
take,
in
effect,
first
crack
at
subject
matter
jurisdiction
if
that's
possible,
or
does
your
argument
rest
on
a
further
suggestion
that
there
is
likely
to
be
a
different...
difference
in
result
depending
on
where
the
state
courts
or
federal
courts
decide
the
personal
jurisdiction?
do
you
suggest
that
the
state
courts
are
more
likely
to
find
the
personal
jurisdictional
prerequisites
present?
unknown
speaker
you're
just
saying
in
a
close
case
in
which
courts
could
reasonably
go
either
way,
it's
better
to
let
the
state
court
have
the
first
chance
if
that's
possible.
unknown
speaker
so
that's
essentially
a
dignitary
kind
of
argument.
unknown
speaker
is
there
any
sense
among
the
practicing
bar
in
texas
that
the
state
courts
are
more
likely
to
find
personal
jurisdiction
than
the
federal
courts
are?
unknown
speaker
what
is
the
difference?
unknown
speaker
well,
that
seems
odd
for
some
reason.
mr.
hutchinson,
isn't
that
a
federal,
the
whole
thing
a
federal
question?
here,
the
assertion
is
there
is
no
power
over
me
compatible
with
due
process,
and
since
the
texas
statute
goes
the
length
of
due
process,
we
don't
have
to
worry
about
it,
we
stop
short
of
that.
it's
a
question
of
due
process,
and
yet
you're
suggesting
that
the
state
court
could
have
a
burden
of
proof
that
makes
it
easier
for
a
plaintiff
to
assert
jurisdiction
over
a
defendant
than
in
the
federal
court.
i
would
think
that
that,
since
it's
a
federal
constitutional
question,
would
have
to
come
out
the
same
way
with
the
same
burdens
in
both
courts,
and
if
the
texas
courts
have
said
something
different,
the
defendant
has
to
negate
jurisdiction,
that's--
unknown
speaker
--i
think
you've
answered
the
question,
mr.
hutchinson.
thank
you.
unknown
speaker
mr.
wright,
you
have
10
minutes
remaining.
unknown
speaker
do
you
acknowledge,
mr.
wright,
that
there's
a
stronger
case
for
what
mr.
hutchinson
proposes
in
the
removal
situation,
or
does
it
really
come
down
to
the
same
thing
anyway,
just
a
federal
court
acting
beyond
its...
allegedly
acting
beyond
its
subject
matter
jurisdiction?
unknown
speaker
the
honorable
court
is
now
adjourned
until
tomorrow
at
ten
o'clock.
unknown
speaker
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
98-470,
