mr.
michael
a.
carvin
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i'd
like
to
pick
up
with
the
point
that
ms.
mahoney
was
just
addressing,
because
i
want
to
make
sure
that
the
factual
premise
for
our
standing
is
clear.
i
think
the
key
point
for
the
court
to
understand
is
that
there
will
be
no
100-percent
actual
enumeration
in
2001.
there
will
be
no
100-percent
head
count.
what
the
census
bureau
will
do
is
enumerate
90
percent
of
the
households,
and
then
will
do
two
statistical
estimations--
mr.
michael
a.
carvin
--both,
your
honor.
they
will
try
and
achieve,
mr.
chief
justice,
90-percent
in
each
census
tract
and,
of
course,
in
the
aggregate
that
will
be
90-percent
of
the
households--
mr.
michael
a.
carvin
--yes,
that's
correct,
your
honor,
and
they--
mr.
michael
a.
carvin
--precisely,
justice
o'connor.
they
anticipate
that
about
67
percent
of
the
people
who
they
mail
out
to
will
mail
back
to
them,
and
then
so
assume
you'll
have
30
percent
of
the
people
in
a
census
tract
will
not
have
responded,
to
make
it
simple.
what
they
will
do
is
then
go
send
an
enumerator
to
20
percent
of
the
households,
in
other
words,
to
get
to
90
percent.
mr.
michael
a.
carvin
i...
no--
mr.
michael
a.
carvin
--yes.
mr.
michael
a.
carvin
right.
mr.
michael
a.
carvin
as
to
the
icm,
that
is
true.
mr.
michael
a.
carvin
we
object
to
both--
mr.
michael
a.
carvin
--it's
significant
for
standing
purposes,
justice
stevens,
for
this
reason.
we
need...
we
argue
that
the
100-percent
head
count
is
the
only
permissible
means
of
apportioning
the
population
in
2001.
mr.
michael
a.
carvin
yes.
i
have
to
answer
that
on
two
levels,
justice
ginsburg.
there's
always
been
a
100-percent
head
count
of
those
people
who
could
reasonably
be
found
through
traditional
enumeration
techniques.
no
one
has
ever
thought
that
that
included
every
person
residing
in
the
continental
united
states,
but
clearly
it
was
always...
every
census
has
made
a
good
faith
effort
to
count
100
percent
of
the
households
that
they
know
are
occupied.
this
is
the
first
time
that
the
census
bureau
has
decided
it
will
cost
too
money...
too
much
money
to
do
that,
so
what
we're
going
to
do
is
estimate
10
percent
of
the
population,
roughly
27
million
people.
mr.
michael
a.
carvin
as...
on
the
summary
judgment
on
the
merits
we
do
not
contest
that
it
is
more
accurate,
because
that's
a
disputed
issue
of
fact,
so
no,
we
are
saying
regardless
of
its
relative
accuracy
it
is
nonetheless
illegal
and
unconstitutional.
for
standing
purposes,
my
point
is
that
you
can't
have
an
apportionment
if
you
accept
our
allegations
as
true
in
2001,
because
you
won't
have
the
100
percent
apportionment
number.
so
this
is
no
different
than
the
census
bureau
saying
tomorrow
we'll
enumerate
50
percent
of
the
houses,
or
not
conduct
any
census
at
all,
and
that
hurts
two
kinds
of
people.
it
hurts
people
who
will
benefit
from
the
apportionment
in
2001,
like,
it
is
undisputed,
the
state
of
georgia,
which
will
gain
an
additional
seat.
they
would
be
in
a
better
position
if
the
census
bureau
had
done
its
constitutional
duty.
it
will
also
hurt,
to
return
to
your
question,
justice
stevens,
in
indiana
people
who
are
likely
to
have
more
congressmen
under
the
100-percent
head
count
than
they
will
retain
under
defendant's
sampling.
mr.
michael
a.
carvin
well,
under
lujan,
remember,
they
are
moving
for
summary
judgment
on
standing.
we
are
the
respondents,
and
under
lujan
you
must
accept
the
allegations
in
our
affidavits
as
true.
mr.
michael
a.
carvin
this
procedural
posture
is
identical
to
the
city
of
new
york
line
item
veto
case
from
last
year.
plaintiffs
were
moving
for
summary
judgment
on
the
merits,
the
government
was
in
essence
moving
for
summary
judgment
on
standing,
and
what
the
court
did
in
that
case
was
look
at
the
affidavits
and
see
if
they
had
alleged
facts
that,
if
true,
would
show
likely
injury,
and
that
is
exactly
what
indiana
has
done
here.
but
the
other
important
point,
i
think,
to
focus
on
here
is
that
we
are
like,
the
indiana
plaintiffs
are
like
the
people
in
lujan
who
had
lived
next
to
a
federally
licensed
dam.
as
the
court
held
in
lujan,
they
would
have
standing
to
insist
upon
an
environmental
impact
statement
to
be
built...
to
be
done
before
the
dam
was
built.
mr.
michael
a.
carvin
uh
huh.
mr.
michael
a.
carvin
uh
huh.
mr.
michael
a.
carvin
no.
i
think
all
the
court
need
do
is
read
our
affidavits
from
our
expert,
as
the
district
court
had
done.
mr.
michael
a.
carvin
well,
actually,
your
honor,
in
terms
of
intrastate
redistricting,
they
were
not
disputed
in
any
way,
shape,
or
form.
mr.
michael
a.
carvin
our
point
is
that--
mr.
michael
a.
carvin
--intra,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
what
i
mean
by
that
is
that
we
have
three
counties,
delaware
county,
cumberland
county,
and
bergen
county,
who,
it
is
undisputed,
are
likely
to
have
less
population
under
the
government's
sampling
plan
than
they
would
have
under
the
100-percent
enumeration
and,
as
i
say,
please
read
their
affidavits,
read
their
briefs.
the
government
nowhere
alleges
that
it
is
remotely
conceivable
that
it
is
possible
that
those
three
counties
will
do
as
well
under
their
plan
as--
mr.
michael
a.
carvin
--it
is
not
yet
in
issue
because
they've
never
come
up
with
such
a
plan.
in
other
words,
there's
no
dispute
that
this
plan,
where
they
will
use
one
population
number
for
apportionment,
redistricting,
and
funding,
will
hurt
us
because
it
will
cost
us
money.
mr.
michael
a.
carvin
no.
we
are
alleging
injury
intrastate.
the
reason
it
is
unlawful
is
because
you
cannot
use
a
sampling
population
number
for
apportionment.
mr.
michael
a.
carvin
right.
mr.
michael
a.
carvin
justice
scalia--
mr.
michael
a.
carvin
--right,
and
the
only
way
the
solicitor
general
can
avoid
that,
justice
ginsburg,
is
hypothesizing
that
for
the
first
time
in
american
history
the
census
is
going
to
come
up
with
two
population
numbers.
it
will
use
the
head
count
number
for
apportionment,
and
then
it
will
use
the
sampling
number
for
redistricting
and
funding,
but
there's
no
administrative
decision
to
do
that.
we
have
no
idea
if
the
states
will
use
the
sampling
number
for
redistricting--
mr.
michael
a.
carvin
--i'm
sorry,
they're...
we
are
now
talking...
the
solicitor
general's
point
is
that
our
injury
will
not
be
redressed
by
the
district
court's
injunction,
and
the
reason
it
won't
be
addressed
is
because
they
could
come
up
with
a
different
plan,
this
two
number
census
plan,
but
it
is
certainly
conceded
that,
absent
judicial
intervention
now,
there
will
only
be
one
population
total
and
that
will,
of
course,
injure
us.
mr.
michael
a.
carvin
precisely,
and
obviously
the
new
jersey
statute
has
always
been
interpreted
as
the
number
produced
by
the
census--
mr.
michael
a.
carvin
--well,
actually,
of
course,
congressional
districts
are
within
a
state.
mr.
michael
a.
carvin
i'm
mainly
focusing
on
state
legislatures.
mr.
michael
a.
carvin
yes.
mr.
michael
a.
carvin
right,
but--
mr.
michael
a.
carvin
--i
may
not
have
been
clear
initially.
state
legislators
do
congressional
redistricting.
it
is
the
state
legislatures
that
draw
congressional
districts--
mr.
michael
a.
carvin
--and
so
obviously,
if
our
population
is
reduced
within
a
state,
we
will
have
a
smaller
share
of
both
congressional
districts
and--
mr.
michael
a.
carvin
--again,
justice
breyer,
it
is
not
in
dispute.
it
is...
and
please,
ask
solicitor
general
waxman
when
he
returns
if
he
can
argue,
and
if...
if
there's
any
affidavit
in
the
record
which
suggests
that
cumberland
county,
delaware
county,
or
bergen
county
is
just
as
likely
to
have
the
same
amount
of
relative
share
of
population
under
defendant's
sampling
plan
as
it
is
under
our
plan.
mr.
michael
a.
carvin
yes,
justice
souter.
the
affidavit
says
that
the
diminution
in
indiana
state's
population
may
not
result...
may
not
be
severe
enough
for
indiana
to
lose
a
congressional
seat.
there
is
no
affidavit
or
similar
argument
that
these
counties
in
the
state
of
pennsylvania
will
lose
population,
and
if
you
lose
population,
even
if
it's
not
enough
to
cost
you
a
congressman,
nonetheless
your
funding
goes
down
and
your
intrastate
representation
goes
down,
and
the
census
bureau
has
made
an
administrative
finding
that
the
adjustment
that
occurred
in
1990
is
predictive
of
the
results
that
will
occur
under
the
adjustment
that
they
will
use
in
2000.
when
they
argued
that
sampling
was
more
accurate
than
a
head
count,
they
had
to
figure
out
what
results
we
could
anticipate
under
a
head
count
and
they
looked
solely
at
the
results
of
the
1990
census
and
assumed
that
those
results
would
be
replicated
down
to
the
census
tract
level.
so
since
they
have
found
that
the
results
of
the
'90
statistical
adjustment
are
predictive
of
the
2000
statistical
adjustment,
they
can
now
not
turn
around
and
for
standing
purposes
deny
that
the
'90
statistical
adjustment
that
we
have
set
out
in
our
facts
will
again
be
replicated
in
the
2000
statistical
adjustment.
mr.
michael
a.
carvin
again,
they--
mr.
michael
a.
carvin
--this...
well,
but
again,
it
says
you
can't
infer
from
the
'90's
figures
that
you
will
lose
enough
population
to
cost
you
a
congressman
because--
mr.
michael
a.
carvin
--because
the
method
of
equal
proportions
turns
on
such
small--
mr.
michael
a.
carvin
--changes
in
populations.
but
at
the
general
level
of
saying,
you
will
lose
population,
yes,
these
people
who
were
adjusted
downward
in
1990,
they
actually
had
populations
subtracted
from
these
counties
while
everyone
else
was,
of
course,
having
population
added
to
them.
mr.
michael
a.
carvin
precisely.
mr.
michael
a.
carvin
and
that
was
the
reason
i
conceded
below
that
you
don't
need
to
focus
on
indiana.
i
would
like
to
make
the
additional
point
that
indiana--
mr.
michael
a.
carvin
--well--
mr.
michael
a.
carvin
--your
honor,
we've
never
filed--
mr.
michael
a.
carvin
--your
honor,
we
had
page
limitations,
and
we
only
focused
on
disputed
facts.
mr.
michael
a.
carvin
right,
your
honor,
but
it
wasn't
contested.
it
wasn't
contested
below,
it's
not
contested--
mr.
michael
a.
carvin
--and
if
i
haven't
made
it
clear,
i
hope
i
have
clarified
in
argument
that
this
is
in
accepted
facts,
that
the
states
will
use
the
census
number
for
apportionment
absent
judicial
intervention
for
intrastate
redistricting,
and
that
will
cost
us
voting
power.
federal
agencies
will
use
the
census
number
to
distribute
funds,
and
that
will
cost
us
money.
so
i
don't
think
that
this
is
a
situation,
the
additional
point
i
guess
i'd
make,
is
where
we
need
to
prove
it
was
scientific--
mr.
michael
a.
carvin
--oh,
no.
it
would
only
happen
to
us
if
the
census
bureau
makes
an
entirely
different
decision
than
is
already
made.
for
example,
last
year
in
akins
they
could
have
denied
plaintiff
in
that
case,
mr.
akins,
apac's
membership
numbers
if
they'd
used
a
different
rationale
to
withhold
apac's
membership
information,
but
this
court
held
quite
clearly
that
it
doesn't
matter
if
the
agency
can
make
the
same
decision
pursuant
to
a
different
legal
rationale,
because
plaintiffs
have
ability
to
challenge
the
legal
rationale
that
is
motivating
this
plan,
and
no
one
argues
that
they
can
implement
this
plan,
that
they've
got
to
come
up
with
a
different
plan.
but
just
as
speculation
about
what
the
government
will
do
doesn't
give
plaintiff
standing,
the
government
can't
defeat
standing
by
speculating
about
some
other
plan
that
it
might
come
up
with
for
the
first
time
in
american
history,
so
in
terms
of
what
they
are
going
to
do,
it
will
injure
us,
and
it
is
irrelevant
that
they
could
legally
injure
us
if
they
came
up
with
a
different
plan,
just
as
it
was
irrelevant
in
akins.
mr.
michael
a.
carvin
well,
but
as
you
pointed
out
earlier
justice
breyer,
all
141
does
is
authorize
sampling
as
specified
in
the
subsequent
statutory
provisions
that
deal
directly
with
sampling.
the
solicitor
general
argues
that
the
word
sampling
in
141
is
therefore
somewhat
redundant,
but
the
presumption
against
redundancy
has
been
incredibly
rebutted
in
this
statute,
because
the
solicitor
general
simultaneously
concedes
that
the
solicitor
general's
authority
for
nonapportionment
sampling
under
141
is
controlled
by
section
195,
that
you
need
to
read
section
195
into
141
for
nonapportionment
sampling.
also,
of
course,
it's
inherent
in
the
statutory
scheme.
they
use
the
word
sampling
four
times.
every
time
they
gave
the
secretary
authority
in
1976
they
threw
in,
including
sampling.
now,
we
know
that
wasn't
intended
to
mean
anything,
because
in
14(d),
which
deals
strictly
with
mid
decade
apportionment
and
therefore
deals...
mid
decade
census,
and
therefore
has
nothing
to
do
with
apportionment
sampling,
it
deals
strictly
with
nonapportionment
sampling,
they
have
the
same
language,
and
they
say
the
secretary
can
do
nonapportionment
sampling.
that
is
entirely
meaningless,
because
everyone
agrees
that
under
section
195
the
secretary
already
had
authority
to
do
nonapportionment
sampling,
so
the
reference
to
sampling
in
the
mid
decade
sentencing
provision
was
entirely
meaningless,
showing
conclusively
that
congress
didn't
intend
for
this
language
to
have
any
substantial
import.
my
final
point
is,
even
if
the
grant
to
the
secretary
is
ambiguous,
the
defendant's
plan
is
still
unlawful,
because
clearly,
if
you
are
making
a
major
change
in
policy
after
190
years,
this
court
has
ruled
in
seven
different
cases
cited
throughout
our
briefs
that
that
change
in
policy
needs
to
be
done
through
a
plain
statement
rule.
it
needs
to
be
done
clearly
and
unambiguously,
and
that
has
certainly
not
been
accomplished
here.
moreover,
of
course--
mr.
michael
a.
carvin
--sure.
mr.
michael
a.
carvin
my
position
is
that
all
of
them
have
a
realistic
possibility
of
losing
a
seat,
and
since
this
is
a
case,
like
an
environmental
impact
statement,
where
the
alleged
refusal
of
the
government
to
provide
information
is
what
is
at
issue,
they
need
not
show
that
providing
them
the
information
will
definitely
benefit
them.
mr.
michael
a.
carvin
both
are
true,
perhaps
two
or
three,
but
again,
we're
not
relying
on
that
part
of
our
affidavit.
the
uncontested
part
of
our
affidavit
goes
to
the
counties
losing
funds
and
intrastate
redistricting
power.
that's
uncontested.
what
is
contested
is
that
one
or
two
or
three
of
those
six
states
might
lose
a
congressman,
but
as
again,
under
lujan,
we
need
not
show
that
if
they
gave
us
100
percent
actual
enumeration
number,
we
will
definitely
benefit.
we
need
only
show
that
it
might
benefit
us
realistically,
just
like
an
environmental
impact
statement
might
realistically
benefit
you.
you
need
not
be
caught
in
a
catch
22,
where
you
challenge
the
government's
refusal
to
provide
information,
and
the
standing
requirement
is,
you
must
show
that
the
information
will
definitely
benefit
you,
if
the
reason
you
don't
have
the
information
is
because
the
government
has
unlawfully
refused
to
provide
you
with
that
information.
so
under
any
theory
of
standing,
we
have
it
both
on
an
interstate
basis,
and
on
an
intrastate
basis,
and
as
the
chief
justice
pointed
out
earlier,
this
court
will
be
in
no
better
position
to
resolve
this
factual
question
in
2001,
because
in
2001,
as
today,
there
will
not
be
a
100-percent
actual
enumeration
number.
so
if
you
insist
the
plaintiffs
show
you
that
we
will
have
10
congressmen
under
the
100-percent
head
count
number
and
we
will
only
have
9
under
the
defendant's
sampling
plan,
no
plaintiff
will
ever
be
able
to
make
that
showing,
because
there
will
never
be
a
100-percent
actual
enumeration
number,
since
they
have
decided
to
stop
at
90
percent
in
counting
people,
and
they
have
decided
to
statistically
estimate
the
rest
of
those
people
up
to
100
percent.
and
to
return
very
briefly
to
the
constitution,
if
actual
enumeration
is
a
process,
then
clearly,
the
only
process
it
contemplates
is
counting.
