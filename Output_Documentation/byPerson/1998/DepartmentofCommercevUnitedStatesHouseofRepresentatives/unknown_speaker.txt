unknown
speaker
general
waxman,
i
understand
there
are...
there
are
two
kinds
of
statistical
sampling
involved
here.
and
i
want
to
ask
you
about
the
first
one...
rather
the
second
one...
which
i...
i
gather
is
a
series
of
750,000
housing
units,
selected
randomly.
and
they
will
then
be
used
to
adjust
the
figures
from
census
tracts?
unknown
speaker
well,
that
initial
enumeration
is
first
based
on
responses
and
then
based
on
follow
up
interviews?
unknown
speaker
but
when
you
say
up
to
90
percent,
there...
there
is
going
to
be
an
intentional
effort
not
to
do
100
percent?
unknown
speaker
let...
let's...
let's
stay
on
the
question
of
describing
this...
this
procedure.
unknown
speaker
so...
so
you
will
get
the
initial
returns
from
the
census.
and
then
you
send...
send
out
follow
up
people
to
try
to
contact
those
who
were
not
contacted.
but
then
you
use
this
to
kind
of
change
the
results
from
that,
as
i
understand
it?
unknown
speaker
how
can
you
know
in
advance
that
there
are
inaccuracies?
unknown
speaker
but
how
can
you
know...
but
if...
if
you
have
this
census,
which
is
a
very...
and
it's
inaccurate,
it
doesn't
reflect
the,
quote,
true
number,
how...
how
do
you
know
what
the,
quote,
true
number,
close
quote,
is?
unknown
speaker
well,
why
do
we
need...
why
do
we
need
a
census
then?
unknown
speaker
well,
most
people
would
think
that
actual
enumeration
meant
a
count.
i
mean
that...
that's
what
immediately
springs
to
mind.
and
how
do
you
get
around
that?
unknown
speaker
and
you
would
call
that
an
actual
enumeration;
you
sort
of
scan
camden
yards
and
say,
it's
the
best
i
can
do,
it's
25,000,
you
would
call
that
an
actual
enumeration?
unknown
speaker
what...
what--
unknown
speaker
--what,
in
your
judgment,
is
excluded
by
the
adjective
"actual"?
i
mean
they
could
have
said
"enumeration".
it
seems
to
me
they
went
out
of
their
way
to
say
an
actual
enumeration.
unknown
speaker
if...
if...
if
estimation
by
statistics
or
anything
else
is
not
excluded,
what
is
excluded,
rolling
the
dice
or...
or
what?
unknown
speaker
it
says
"actual
enumeration".
what
is
the
adjective
there...
what
does
it
bring
to
our...
to
our
decision
here?
unknown
speaker
you
say
it
means
not
a
phony
enumeration,
not
a
false
enumeration;
is
that...
is
that
all
it
means?
unknown
speaker
it
has
to
be
a
real
enumeration?
unknown
speaker
but
for
that
we
would
have
thought
a
phony
enumeration
would
do,
had
they
not
put
in
"actual"?
unknown
speaker
all
right.
isn't...
isn't
that
sort
of
the
clue
that...
that
the
word
"actual"
is
not
so
much
excluding
as
contrasting
with
what
follows
it?
and
what
follows
it
is
not
so
much
an
arbitrary
assignment
of
representatives,
but
an
assignment
which
i
suppose
was
based,
just
as
you
said,
on
state
records
and
what
everybody
more
or
less
guessed.
unknown
speaker
isn't
that
a
plausible
explanation
for
why
the
word
"actual"
is
not
redundant
here?
unknown
speaker
general
waxman,
do
you
mean
actual
enumeration
is
to
be
contrasted
with
what
the
article
says,
that
is,
actual
enumeration
in
comparison
to
three
from
mass...
three
from
new
hampshire...
was
it...
eight
from
massachusetts,
10
from
virginia...
that's
the
comparison
for
the
actual
enumeration
in
place
of
what
was
going...
the
enumeration
going
in?
unknown
speaker
well,
was
there
much...
much
in
the
way
of
an
option
or
alternatives
in
1787
to
conducting
a
door
to
door
census?
unknown
speaker
do
we
know
how
the
early
censuses
were
taken?
unknown
speaker
they
had...
they
had
estimation
techniques
then--
unknown
speaker
--as
we
have
it
now.
now
you
may
say
they
were
cruder,
but
they
certainly
had
estima...
they
must
have
used
estimation
techniques
for
the
initial
allocation
among
the
states,
right?
unknown
speaker
but
you
began...
you
began
with
some
estimation,
right?
unknown
speaker
and
the
difference
now
is
that
we're
better
at
estimating
than
we
were
then,
and
that
makes
estimation
okay?
unknown
speaker
i
would
think
just
the
opposite,
frankly.
i
would
think
that
the
difficulty
of
finding
people
in
the
early
frontier
days
was
much
greater
than
the
difficulty
of...
of
actually
finding
the
people
today.
you...
you'd
have
to
send
somebody
out
into
the
wilderness
to
see
how
many
mountain
men
are
out
there.
why
not...
you
know,
why
not
estimate
how
many...
how
many
went
through
st.
louis,
or
whatever?
it
seems
to
me
an
estimation
would
have
been
much...
much
more
likely
to
be
used
then
than
it
is
now.
unknown
speaker
is
that...
is
that
what
we're
interested
in
for
purposes
of
apportionment?
i
mean
i
take
it
that
there
is
no
objection
to
sampling
for...
nobody
objects,
everybody
uses
sampling
for
purposes
of
giving
money
out--
unknown
speaker
--yeah--
unknown
speaker
--no.
but
i...
i
mean
here,
there
is
no
argument
among
anybody.
everybody
agrees,
nobody
disagrees
with
you,
you
can
use
sampling
for
giving
out
money.
we're
only
concerned
with
allocating
435
representatives
among
the
states?
unknown
speaker
all
right.
as
long
as
that's
the
case,
i
take
it,
even
if
we
were
more
accurate
in
five
of
the
states
and
a
little
more
accurate
in
two
of
the
states,
in
terms
of
getting
to
what
you
call
the
real
number,
that
would
still
be
worse
for
purposes
of
apportionment.
because
if
we're
off
by
50
percent
across
the
board,
it
works
perfectly.
if
we're
off
by
80
percent
across
the
board,
it
works
perfectly.
it's
the
same
division
of
representatives.
unknown
speaker
it's...
it's
only
if...
it's
only
if
you...
you
get
differences
in
the
errors
that
it
begins
to
make
a
difference.
unknown
speaker
yeah.
unknown
speaker
all
right.
so
now
you're
saying
there...
there...
all
these
scientific
groups
agree
that
if
you're
allowed
to
go
ahead
with
this
sampling
there
will
be
greater
distributional
accuracy;
that
is
to
say,
the
relationship
of
indiana
and
california
will
be,
compared
one
to
the
other,
closer
in
terms
of
accuracy?
unknown
speaker
yeah.
unknown
speaker
then
can
i
go
back
to
the
chief
justice's
question?
my...
my
understanding
of
this
is
that
on
method
one
you
will
get
some
mail
surveys
back...
think
of
a
particular
census
block,
i
guess
if...
maybe
there
are
30
housing
units...
i
don't
know
if
i
have
the
right
terminology.
unknown
speaker
all
right.
so
you'll
get,
like,
questionnaires
back.
and
you'll
count
people
in
terms
of
the
answer
to
the
questionnaire.
and
then
where
you
don't
get
a
questionnaire
back,
you
send
somebody
to
the
house.
and
then
when
you
don't
get
either,
you
do
a
little
estimating.
that's
the
first
method.
unknown
speaker
is
that
right,
basically?
unknown
speaker
crudely?
unknown
speaker
all
right.
yeah,
but
this...
no,
this
is...
so
that...
let's
think
of
census
block
a.
and
census
block
a
roughly
we
counted
in
the
way
we
did.
and
then
there
are
certain
hundreds
of
thousands
of
those
census
blocks
all
over
the
country...
or
maybe
millions.
now,
in
method
two,
we're
going
to
take
census
block
b,
which
is
one
of
our
750,000
sample
blocks.
unknown
speaker
or
25,000
sample
units.
it's
one
of
the
cells
that
we're
really
going
to
look
at.
and
there,
i
take
it,
we
physically
go
out
with
people
and
literally
dig
up
everybody.
i
mean
we
go
not
just
door
to
door,
we
really...
we
really
do
this
thoroughly.
is
that
what
happens?
unknown
speaker
yes,
right.
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
we've
tried
to
get
away
from
that,
yes.
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
all
right.
unknown
speaker
so,
but
in
any
case,
as
to
that--
unknown
speaker
--yes.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
now--
unknown
speaker
--in
the
second...
we're
at
the
second
one...
and
the
second
one,
in
our
750,000
sample
blocks,
we
really
are
thorough.
we
do
real,
actual
enumeration
beyond
belief.
is...
is
that
right?
i
mean
it's
really
very,
very
actual
enumeration.
it's
certainly
the
most
complete
actual
enumeration.
unknown
speaker
and
then
we
extrapolate
from
those
750,000
to
the
x
million
that
we
didn't
have
time
to
do
that
thorough
on...
to
do
that
thorough
a
count
on?
unknown
speaker
so
my
question
was
the
same
as
the
beginning.
if
you
were
going
to
do
this
with
the
second
phase,
what...
what
at
that
point
does
the
first
phase
have
to
do
with
your
final
answer?
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask--
unknown
speaker
--general
waxman--
--may
i
ask
an
elementary
and
rather
stupid
question?
as
of
what
date
during
the
year
is
the
census
supposed
to
determine
the
number
of
people?
unknown
speaker
so
you
don't
count
people
born
after
april
1st?
unknown
speaker
general
waxman,
may
i...
may
i
ask
you
something
that
relates
to
the
questions
you
were
asked
by
justice
breyer?
and
your
answers
confused
me.
you
said,
of
course,
for
other
purposes,
you
can
use
the
method
that
you
say
is
the...
the
one
that
the
scientists
agree
on.
would
you...
suppose
you
were
to
lose
this
case,
would
you
indeed
conduct
two
census...
censuses?
i
thought
one
of
your
positions
were
that,
practically,
the
answer
to
this
question
drives
what
you
would
do
for
the
other
purposes.
or
would
you
conduct
two
censuses?
unknown
speaker
but
if
the
decision
went
the
other
way,
couldn't
you
say,
well,
it's
not
feasible
to
use
it
for
the
other
purposes,
because
it
would
cost
so
much
to
run
it
two
ways?
unknown
speaker
they'd
do
it
like
they
always
have
done
it.
unknown
speaker
yeah.
unknown
speaker
are
there
any
other
purposes...
the
other
purposes...
the
briefs
mention
redistricting,
intrastate
redistricting
and
distribution
of
federal
funds...
are
there
any
other
purposes,
or
are
those
three--
unknown
speaker
--general,
are
you
going
to
get
to
standing?
unknown
speaker
i...
yes.
just
before
you
do,
may
i
ask
about
the
posture
of
this
case?
it
was
decided
on
summary
judgment.
so
i
thought
we
must
therefore
assume
everything
that
you
say
about
this
leading
to
a
more
accurate
count
is
so.
of
course
that
was
never
tested
in
an
adversarial
way.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
thought...
now
wait
a
minute...
i
thought
there
was
evidence
in
the
record
from
indiana
that
it
was
virtually
certain
that
indiana
will
lose
a
seat
under
the
new
plan.
at
least
that's
the
expert
witness's
affidavit.
unknown
speaker
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
for
indiana?
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
well,
let's...
let's
think
for
a
moment,
general
waxman.
i
mean
the...
the
census
has
to
be
taken,
one
way
or
another,
i
guess,
next
spring.
now
if
the
court
were
to
reverse
the
district
court
here,
not
on
a
question
of
law
or
not
on
a
question
of
written
law,
but
on
the
grounds
that
it
shouldn't
have
granted
summary
judgment,
it
should
have
itself
decided
factual
issues
in
dispute,
i
daresay
we
would
have
no
definitive
pronouncement
on
the
legal
questions
involved
here
probably
before...
we
would
do
well
to
get
one
in
june.
unknown
speaker
because
that
seems
to
me
to
contradict
your
argument
on
the
merits.
the
first
half
hour
you
were
saying
how
important
it
is
to
do
this.
and
now
you're
saying
it
doesn't
make
any
difference.
unknown
speaker
who...
who
could
challenge
a
disputed
census
procedure
then?
unknown
speaker
well,
but...
well,
what
good
does
that
do
anybody
to...
you
mean
to
say
do
a
census
over
again
in
1993
because
it
wasn't
done
correctly
in
1990?
unknown
speaker
how
would
you
challenge
it
after
the
fact?
you...
you
would
compare
the
figures
that...
that
you
came
up
with
under
this
new
system
with
what?
since
you
haven't
done
it
under
the
old
system--
unknown
speaker
--how
can
you
show
that
you've
been
injured?
unknown
speaker
no,
but
your
experts
would
come
in,
just
as
they
came
in
below,
and
say
well,
you
were
using
the
1990
census...
census
figures,
that...
that's--
unknown
speaker
--that's
what
was
used
in
rebuttal
to
the
indiana
argument,
that,
well,
you
were
using
the
1990
figures;
things
have
changed
since
1990.
unknown
speaker
but
you
will--
--some...
some
court
would
decide
what
the
population
of
the
united
states
was
in
19...
in
2000?
unknown
speaker
well,
but
you
have
to
read
section
195,
too,
don't
you?
you...
you
have
to--
unknown
speaker
--apply
both.
unknown
speaker
and
certainly
195
was
thought
for
many
years
to
preclude
the
use
of
sampling
for
purposes
of
apportionment.
unknown
speaker
well,
don't
you
think
that
before
it
was
amended
in
'76,
that
everyone
thought
it
precluded
using
sampling?
unknown
speaker
but
didn't
they?
didn't
they
think
that?
unknown
speaker
i
mean
the
obvious
thing
which
i
think
they'll
say
as
soon
as
they
begin
to
talk,
your
opponents,
is...
is
that
141
is
an
introductory
section;
141
says
take
a
census
of
population.
then
143
says
take
a
census
of
agriculture.
and
161
says
take
a
census
of
government.
and
then,
when
you
get
to
193,
at
the
end,
it
begins
to
tell
you
more
detail.
and
so
they'll
say
that's...
that's
what
they
say
in
their
briefs...
but
what...
what
is
your
response
to
that,
that
these
introductory
sections
give
the
basic
authorization,
and
of
course
they
give
it
broadly,
and
then
the
later
sections
limit
how
you
do
it?
that's
their...
i
think
that's,
as
i
understand
it,
a
basic
argument
that
they
make.
unknown
speaker
yes,
you
may,
general
waxman.
ms.
mahoney,
we'll
hear
from
you.
unknown
speaker
ms.
mahoney,
what
is
your
response
to
the...
i
guess
to
the
objection
that
if
this
is
a
sufficient
basis
for
standing
here,
the
congress,
as
a
practical
matter,
can
place
any
obligation
on
some
agency
of
the
executive
branch
to
provide
it
with
information
on
a
concrete
subject;
and
if
it
ends
up
not
liking
the...
the
information
that
it
gets,
in
effect,
can
sue
the
executive
branch
on
matters
that
certainly
impinge
on
the
respective
policy
responsibilities
of
the
two
branches?
are
we
opening
up
a
very
large
door
if
we
accept
your
argument?
unknown
speaker
by
whom?
unknown
speaker
yeah,
but
in
this
case,
there
is
no
tradition
of
challenge
by
the
house
of
representatives.
unknown
speaker
well,
but
the
answer
is
going
to
be
no
across
the
board
here,
isn't
it?
i
mean
this
is...
this
a
the
first
time
thing.
unknown
speaker
there's
no
tradition
of
challenge...
as
i
understand
it,
there's
no
tradition
of
challenge
either
by
the
house
or
by
private
parties.
unknown
speaker
did...
have
we
done
it
before
this
past
census?
unknown
speaker
before
this
past
census.
unknown
speaker
how
far
back
does
it
go?
unknown
speaker
it's
not
much
of
a
tradition.
[laughter]
what--
--of
course,
they
were
all
after
the
census
figures
were
available.
unknown
speaker
ms.
mahoney,
in...
in
what
other
areas
have
we
stepped
in
to
resolve
a
dispute
between
the
two
political
branches
rather
than
letting
them
duke
it
out?
unknown
speaker
well...
well,
the
president
thinks
that
you've
succeeded
in
duking
it
out.
unknown
speaker
yeah,
it
was
the
executive
branch
against
itself.
give
me
a
case
where
it
is
the
congress
against
the
president.
or
one
house
of
the
congress
against
the
president.
unknown
speaker
give
me
a
case
without
a
private
party.
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
when
was
this
decided?
unknown
speaker
oh,
during
the
period
when
the
d.c.
circuit
was
notorious
for
its
expansive
view
of
standing.
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
i
don't
like
injecting
us
into...
into
a
battle
between
the
two
political
branches.
i...
i
think
they
may
survive.
i'm
not
sure
we
will.
unknown
speaker
well,
they...
they
haven't
reached
an
impasse,
because
congress
basically
has
enacted
a
statute,
and
then
gives
its
own
separate
houses
the
standing
to
challenge
it.
that...
that...
it
seems
to
me
that
destroys
all
discipline
that's
required
for
a
separation
of
powers
system.
and
i...
i
don't
know
how...
how
would
you
confine
this?
well,
it's...
it's
a
census.
it's
important
because
of
how
the
house
of
representatives
itself
is
composed.
i
mean
is
that...
is
that
the
limiting
principle?
unknown
speaker
but
the
national
separation
of
powers
was
not
involved
in
that
case?
unknown
speaker
does
it
matter
at
all
that
that
language,
"actual
enumeration",
was
just
put
in
there
by
the
committee
on
style,
when
the
drafting
history
shows
that
what
was
used
in
the
constitution
was
"numbers"?
then
it
goes
to
the
committee
on
style,
and
it
comes
back
"actual
enumeration".
does
that
matter?
unknown
speaker
ms.
mahoney,
can
i
ask
you
a
question
that's
sort
of
the
converse
of
the
question
justice
scalia
asked
about
what
does
"actual"
mean
if
it
doesn't
mean,
you
know,
the
very
narrow
confinement?
what...
what,
in
your
view,
would
be
permissible
if
a
census
taker
got
no
response
from
a
particular
address,
went
to...
say
it's
a
large
apartment
complex
and
everybody
in
the
neighborhood
knows
it's...
they
have
lots
of
undocumented
aliens
that
live
in
there,
but
nobody
is
going
to
tell
you
how
many
because
they
just
don't
want
to
reveal
the
information?
what
does...
what
does
the
constitution
permit
the
census
taker
to
do
to
find
out
how
many
people
live
in
that
apartment
complex
and
other
similar
apartment
complexes?
unknown
speaker
and
say
no...
they
say,
we're
not
going
to
talk.
we--
unknown
speaker
--we
don't
want
to
tell
you
about
what's
going
on.
unknown
speaker
so
they...
what
do...
do
they
put
down
zero
then?
unknown
speaker
okay.
unknown
speaker
but
they
would
know
that
there
were
a
lot
of
people
in
there.
they
couldn't
find
out
how
many.
so
the
objective
standard
would
require
you
list
it
as
zero?
unknown
speaker
even
if
the
lights
go
on
and
off
in
the
evening?
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
ms.
mahoney,
i
know
we're
going
over
to
the
merits
now,
but
i
would
like
you
just
to
stay
with
the
standing
a
moment
longer.
because
i
don't
see
a
stopping
point,
other
than
congress
says,
gee,
this
is
really
important;
we
want
you
to
resolve
it,
court.
and
i
also
don't
catch
what
you
said
about
the
legislature
exhausted
its
legislative
remedies.
well,
it
would
have...
it
didn't...
it
didn't
pass
the
first
bill
over
the
president's
veto.
so
it's
not
a
question
that...
it
failed
in
that
endeavor.
could
the
legislature
even
now
say,
well,
we
don't
like
what
the
president
and
the
bureau
of
census
is
doing,
so
we're
going
to
say
no
funds
for
the
census;
what
about
that
remedy?
unknown
speaker
sure
it
can.
but
it
could
if
they
had
enough
votes.
it
can...
it
can
refuse
to
appropriate
money
for
the
white
house
staff.
it
can
say,
we're
not
going
to
give
you
any
money.
there...
there
are
900
ways
that
the
house
can...
can
stymie
the
president
if
it
has
the
political
will
to
do
it.
and
you're
telling
me
it
doesn't
have
the
political
will,
so
we
should
solve
the
problem
for
the
house.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
wouldn't
do
that.
i
wouldn't
do
that.
i'm
withholding
money
for
the
white
house.
[laughter]
the
white
house
staff.
unknown
speaker
i'll
go
with
justice
scalia's,
withhold
money
from
whatever.
unknown
speaker
the
wonderful
thing
about
not
appropriating
money
is
that
you
don't
have
to
pass
legislation.
all
you
have
to
do
is
not
pass
legislation.
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
you
see.
and
that's
the
way
congress
usually
makes
its
will
felt
in
these
disputes
with
the
president,
who
has
the
veto
power.
it
says,
okay,
you
can't
veto
non
legislation.
we
are
not
going
to
appropriate
money
for
the
white
house.
why
can't
the
house
do
that?
unknown
speaker
when
you
say
it's
intractable,
you
mean
the
president
has
won
and
the
house
is
unwilling
to
do
whatever
further
is
necessary
to...
to
bring
the
president
to
heel
on
the
point.
unknown
speaker
but
that's
a
political
dispute.
we
don't
get
into
that
kind
of
stuff.
well,
ms.
mahoney,
i
suppose
if
the
glavin
plaintiffs
have
standing,
we
don't
have
to
worry
about
whether
the
house
does,
do
we?
unknown
speaker
but
what
do
we
do
about
the...
it's
a
summary
judgment
and
so
forth
on
the
indiana
plaintiff
then?
unknown
speaker
i
mean
who
has
that--
unknown
speaker
--who...
who...
which
individual
has
been
hurt,
and
how
has
that
been
demonstrated?
unknown
speaker
oh,
okay.
unknown
speaker
all
right.
when
you...
when
you
looked
this
up...
this
is
meant
to
be
somewhat
supportive,
but...
because
this
is
a
case
in
which
congress
and
the
president
have
asked
this
court
to
decide
this
question;
it's
not
a
case
of
we're
doing
it
without
their
permission.
they
passed
a
statute
saying
to
decide
it.
now,
if
we
were
in
fact...
if
we
were
in
fact
to
say
there
is
no
standing
in
this
case
for
the
house,
then
i
take
it
your
argument
is
that
then
the
house
and
the
senate
couldn't
subpoena
witnesses
from
the
executive
branch?
unknown
speaker
i
mean
it's
the
same
kind
of
issue.
how
often...
how
often
in
the
past
has
that
occurred?
you've
probably
looked
into
this.
my
impression
is
it's
fairly
common,
but
it
may
not
be
common
at
all
that
they
subpoena
witnesses.
unknown
speaker
many
times?
a
few?
unknown
speaker
and
of
course,
if
the
executive
is
willing
to
flout
the
congress,
the
executive
might
well
be
willing
to
flout
this
court
if
it
felt
that...
that
its
assertion
of
executive
privilege
was
important
enough.
i
mean
i...
i
don't
see
how
you
solve
these
inter
branch
disputes
by
dragging
in
the
third
branch.
unknown
speaker
but
you
agree,
do
you
not,
that
for
intrastate
redistricting
and
for
federal
funding
purposes
this
is
lawful,
it
is
not
only
lawful
but
required
by
the
act
if
feasible,
or
do
you
take
issue
with
that?
unknown
speaker
so
you
think
for
any
purpose,
it
can't
be
used
for
redistricting
intrastate
or
for
distribution
of
federal
funds.
unknown
speaker
that
seems
to
leave
nothing
for
141
under
the
statute.
unknown
speaker
thank
you,
ms.
mahoney.
mr.
carvin,
we'll
hear
from
you.
unknown
speaker
you
say
90
percent
of
the
households.
does
that
mean
90
percent
of
the
households
in
each
tract,
or
90
percent
en
masse?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
guess
they'll
give
the
forms
to
every
household.
unknown
speaker
so
they're
not
trying
to
get
90
percent.
they're
trying
to
get
them
all,
but
they
know
that
judged
on
past
experience
they're
not
going
to
get
a
return
over
about
67
percent.
unknown
speaker
let
me
just
clarify
one
thing.
supposing
they'd
sent...
they
tried
to
send
them
to
the
remaining
30
instead
of
just
the
20.
your
case
would
still
be
the
same,
wouldn't
it,
because
they
won't
get
answers
from
all
of
them.
unknown
speaker
i
mean,
say
they...
in
other
words
they...
on
the
first
go
around
they
tried
to
get
the
100
percent
instead
of
the
90.
unknown
speaker
but
they
failed
to
get
it,
and
they
only
got
half
of
what
they
try.
unknown
speaker
and
then...
could
they
then
use
sampling?
you'd
say
no.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
so
i
don't
understand
the
significance
of
the
90-percent
argument,
is
what
i'm
trying
to
say.
unknown
speaker
has
there
ever
been
a
100-percent
head
count?
hasn't
there
always
been
people
missed,
as
ms.
mahoney
responded?
unknown
speaker
but
you
must
agree,
because
of
the
summary
judgment
posture
of
this
case,
that
the
scientific
evidence
is
all
in
favor
of
the
government
to
the
effect
that
you
will
get
a
more
accurate
count
of
the
population
their
way.
unknown
speaker
how
can
that
matter
be
resolved
at
the
summary
judgment
stage?
i
mean,
i
didn't
dwell
too
long
on
the
counter
affidavits,
but
among
other
things
it
was
clear
that
the
counter
affidavits
challenge
the
very
factual
basis
of
the
selection
figures
on
which
you
base
your
claim,
so
how
can
that
be
resolved
at
the
summary
judgment
stage?
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
then
there's
something
between
dismissal
and
summary
judgment,
and
even
if
we
say
yes,
under
lujan
you
got
past
the
12(b)(6)
stage,
how
do
you
go
automatically,
as,
frankly,
the
district
court
seems
to
have
done,
said,
well,
we
must
assume
in
favor
of
the
plaintiffs
so
they
get
their
foot
in
the
door,
and
then
that
foot
in
the
door,
it
seems
to
me
they've
gone
all
the
way
into
the
house,
and
then
we
judge
the
merits.
unknown
speaker
yes,
well,
mr.
carvin,
let's
stick
with
this
point
for
just
a
minute.
the
district
court
in
the
glavin
case
said
that
general
factual
allegations
of
injury
may
suffice
to
establish
the
article
iii
standing.
unknown
speaker
now,
let's
just
suppose
that
we
disagree
with
the
district
court
and
think
that
while
that
might
work
for
a
motion
to
dismiss--
unknown
speaker
--that
it
won't
work
for
summary
judgment,
that
there
you
have
to
show
standing.
so
what
do
we
do
here?
do
we
have
to
go
through
the
record
and
try
to
figure
out
whether
there
was
enough
standing,
then,
for
a
summary
judgment
in
connection
with
the
glavin
claimants?
unknown
speaker
well,
they
were
disputed,
of
course,
by
the
other
side.
unknown
speaker
let's
talk
about
intrastate
redistricting.
what
is
your
point?
what
is
your
point
on
that?
unknown
speaker
intrastate?
unknown
speaker
but
i
thought
the
issue
here
was
only
apportionment
among
the
states,
and
you're
getting
into...
there
is
a
dispute
on
it,
but
it
hasn't
been
resolved
by
any
district
court.
general
waxman
told
us
that
for
other
purposes
intrastate,
what
the
census
wants
to
do
is
okay,
and
ms.
mahoney
says,
well,
we
don't
think
it's
okay,
but
it's
not
yet
in
issue.
unknown
speaker
but
i
didn't
think
you
could
allege
in
this
case
that's
before
us
now
anything
other
than
the
interstate
apportionment.
unknown
speaker
you
have
a
new
jersey
statute
which
requires
the
intrastate
apportionment
to
be
done
pursuant
to
the
census.
unknown
speaker
just
as
in
the
new
york
state
case
last
term,
the
line
item
veto
case,
there
was
a
new
york
state
statute
that
required
the
money
to
go
a
certain
way,
and
we
said,
close
enough
for
government
work.
unknown
speaker
now...
so
when
the
new
jersey
state
statute
refers
to
the
census,
it
obviously
refers
to
whatever
census
is
going
to
be
taken.
unknown
speaker
excuse
me.
i
thought
that
it
was
conceded
here
that
they
are
not
going
to
do
a
head
count
number.
unknown
speaker
but
that
certainly
depends
on
what
the
new
jersey
statute
means
by
census,
doesn't
it?
unknown
speaker
by
intrastate,
are
you
talking
about
state
legislators
or
congressmen?
unknown
speaker
is
that
what
you're
talking
about?
unknown
speaker
state
legislatures?
unknown
speaker
the
problem
is,
the
act
talks
about,
it
gives
you
standing
to
any
resident
of
a
state
whose
congressional
representation
or
a
district
could
be
changed.
unknown
speaker
i
take
it
if
we
take
state
legislatures,
then
we're
going
to
have
to
get
to
what
i'd
call
the
prudential
question
of
what
this
act
means.
i
mean--
unknown
speaker
--well,
that's
true,
but
so
what?
unknown
speaker
but
you
have
no
problem
if
you
can
show
that
your
population
is
reduced
significantly
compared
to
others,
because
then
you
fit
around...
but
justice
o'connor
was
pointing
out
that
that
seems
in
dispute,
and
so
if
that's
in
dispute,
and
we
don't
know
what's
going
to
happen
to
indiana's
population,
how
does
it
help
us
to
say
that
the
legislature
may
change
its
makeup?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
don't
think
there's
any
question
about
there
being
an
affidavit
that
makes
those
specific
references,
but
i
think
what's
bothering
a
number
of
us
is
that
there
is
an
affidavit
which
basically
goes
to
the
assumptions
upon
which
all
your
calculations
are
based,
and
i
may
be
missing
something,
but
assuming
there
is
an
affidavit
of
that
sort,
why
is
it
significance
for
intrastate
redistricting
different
from
its
significance
interstate?
there
may
be
a
reason.
i
just
don't
know
what
it
is.
unknown
speaker
but
the
have
done
that
in
an
affidavit.
they
have
done
that.
unknown
speaker
their
affidavit
does
that.
it
says
you
can't
use
the
1990
figures,
doesn't
it?
unknown
speaker
in
indiana.
okay.
unknown
speaker
i
see.
unknown
speaker
so
you're
saying
that
affidavit
doesn't
affect
the
new
jersey
intrastate--
unknown
speaker
--even
though
it
affects
the
indiana.
unknown
speaker
why
did
you
raise
new
jersey,
then,
just
in
a
footnote?
what
is
it,
footnote
11
of
your
brief?
i
mean--
unknown
speaker
--this
is
a
major
part
of
your
argument,
and
it
is
all
contained
in--
unknown
speaker
--appellees
have
satisfied
this
standard
with
respect
to
their
claim
of
interstate
vote...
well,
wait,
that's...
contrary...
well,
i'm
sorry.
unknown
speaker
footnote
25,
it
was.
i
mean...
and
this
is
your
whole
case.
unknown
speaker
all
the
more
reason
to
devote
your
brief
to
it--
[laughter]
--rather
than
footnote
25.
unknown
speaker
but
the
answer
to
your
question
was
that
this
is
going
to
happen
to
you
anyway,
because
we
are
permitted
to
have
the
two
census
things.
unknown
speaker
can
i
ask
you,
what
about
their
main
point?
they
say
that
there's
a
statute
which
says,
except
for
population...
except
for
apportionment
purposes
the
secretary
shall
if
feasible
use
sampling,
and
then
they
say,
a
few
paragraphs
earlier
it
does
say
that
the
secretary
shall
take
a
population
census
in
any
form
he
wants,
including
sampling,
and
unless
that
thing
i
last
said
was
meant
to
allow
him
to
do
what
you
don't
like,
it
would
be
meaningless.
unknown
speaker
mr.
carvin,
may
i
just
ask
one--
unknown
speaker
--clarification?
on
your
position
about
that
string
of
six
states,
are
you
saying...
is
your
position
that
all
of
those
states
would
lose
seats,
or
at
least
one
of
the
six?

no,
but
is
the
possibility
realistic
because
one
of
them
will,
or
because
there
is
a
realistic
possibility
that
more
than
one
of
them
will?

thank
you,
mr.
carvin.

general
waxman,
you
have
3
minutes
remaining.

that
is
not
a
challenge
here,
is
it?
unknown
speaker
i
mean,
that
may
well
be,
but
it's
not
under
challenge
here,
is
it?

since
1940.
unknown
speaker
not
much
of
a
tradition,
either.
unknown
speaker
now,
but
you're
not
using
it
to
increase
the
accuracy.
i
mean,
you
can
say
that
if
you
do
a
100-percent
head
count
and
then
use
statistics
to
try
to
get
the
people
you
didn't
get
in
the
100-percent
head
count.
but
as
described,
and
i
think
it's
an
accurate
description,
you
don't
do
100
percent.
you
don't
even
try
to
do
100
percent
head
count.
you
just
count
90
percent.
