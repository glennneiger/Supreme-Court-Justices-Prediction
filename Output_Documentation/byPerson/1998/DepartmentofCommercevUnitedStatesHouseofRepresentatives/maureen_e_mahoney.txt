ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i'd
like
to
turn
first
to
the
issue
of
justiciability.
congress
passed
the
'98
appropriations
act
to
authorize
this
litigation
to
proceed
in
this
court
before
the
census
was
taken.
because
it
found
it
was
absolutely
critical
to
protect
the
concrete
interests
of
the
house
of
representatives
and
also
to
authorize
private
parties,
who
may
be
injured
as
well,
to
bring
this
controversy
to
the
court
so
it
could
be
resolved
in
time
to
provide
meaningful
relief.
the
house
does
not
expect
this
court
to
find
that
it
has
standing
to
resolve
the
issue
of
standing
if
the
private
parties
have...
have
established
standing
and
if
that
judgment
is
affirmed.
it
would
be
perfectly
appropriate,
and
we
would
agree
that
the
court
should
simply
not
reach
the
issue
of
the
house's
standing
in
those
circumstances.
but
if
for
any
reason
this
court
finds
that
the
private
parties
do
not
have
standing,
it
should
find
that
the
house
does;
that
the
district
court
properly
determined
that
in
these
rare
and
unusual
circumstances
that
congress
acted
well
within
its
constitutional
authority
to
provide
a
cause
of
action
for
the
house
to
come
to
court
to
resolve
this...
this
legal
issue,
this
legal
dispute
which
has
created
an
impasse
between
the
branches,
and
to
provide
relief
so
that
the
house
will
receive
the
information
that
it
has
requested
and
needs
to
perform
its
legislative
functions
and
so
that
its
own
composition
will
not
be
unconstitutionally
and
unlawfully
altered.
these
are
concrete
interests.
these
are
interests
which
are
cognizable.
and...
and
there
is
no
bar
to
the
resolution
of
inter
branch
or
inter
governmental
disputes
under
this
court's
precedence.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
i
don't
think
so,
your
honor,
for
several
reasons.
first
of
all,
there
has
to
be
a
substantial
nexus
between
the
challenge
to
the
executive
branch
conduct
and
the
request
for
information.
and
that
of
course
is
satisfied
here
because,
since
the
beginning
of
our
history,
congress
has
always
relied
upon
the
executive
branch
to
provide
it
with
a
report
of
the
population
numbers,
determined
in
accordance
with
the
constitutional
requirement
for
an
actual
enumeration,
and
the
census
act
requirements
that
it
be
based
on
an
actual
count.
and
so
i...
i
think
that
that
nexus
is
clearly
satisfied
here.
second,
i
think
this
court
could,
and
should,
find
that
the
only
kinds
of
actions
that
should
be
challenged...
subject
to
challenge...
would
be
those
executive
branch
actions
which
have
traditionally
been
subject
to
challenge.
and
again,
here
that
is
clearly
satisfied--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--by
parties
who
have
concrete
injuries.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
your
honor,
there's
no
tradition
of
challenge
by
the
house.
but
in
united
states
v.
nixon,
this
court
said
that
what
you
look
to
is
not...
not
the...
not
the
caption.
you
look
to
see
whether
the...
the
issues,
whether
the...
the
challenge
to
the
conduct
is
one
which
has
traditionally
been
reviewed
or
not.
and
there
the
issue
was
whether
the
president
had
properly
invoked
ex...
executive
privilege--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--well--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--there
is
a
tradition
of
challenging
the
census,
your
honor...
census
decisions
that
have
been
made.
this
court,
in
franklin
and
montana
and
in
wisconsin,
entertained
challenges
by
private
parties
to
the
decisions
that
had
been
made
by
the
executive
with
respect
to
the
conduct
of
the
census.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
have
you
done
it...
excuse
me?
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
well,
your
honor,
the--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--those
three
cases
all
came,
i
think...
i
believe
since
1990.
but
they
specifically
rejected
the
executive's
claim
that
those
were
non
justiciable--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--yes,
your
honor.
but
the...
the
really...
i
think
the
district
court
fully
considered
the
issue
of
ripeness,
and
found
that
here
there
is
really
no
dispute
that
the
use
of
sampling
in
this
case
is
likely...
is...
is...
is
going
to
lead
to
an...
an
alteration
in
the
apportionment
of
the
house
of
representatives.
and...
and
therefore,
to
present
it
with
a
prospect
where
not
only
has
its
composition
been
unlawfully
altered,
but
it's
also
been
deprived
of
the
information
that
it
would
need
in
order
to
correct
that
problem.
and
that's
the...
that
really
is
the
purpose
of
the
report.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
yes.
and
of
course
we
did
try
to
duke
it
out,
your
honor.
that...
those
efforts
were
exhausted.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
the
president
signed
this
legislation.
we
came
to
court
because
this
was
a...
a
reasonable
way
to
resolve
this.
the
two
cases,
your
honor,
where
i
believe
that
are
most
germane
would
be
united
states
v.
nixon,
where
of
course
the
controversy
there...
there
were
only
two
parties
in
that
case
before
this
court...
it
was
a
subordinate
executive
branch
official
and
the...
the
president
himself--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--there
are
two
cases.
chadha
was
a
case.
it
did
have
a
private
party.
but
the...
but
the--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--senate
select
committee
v.
nixon.
it
was
not
heard
by
this
court,
but
it
was
a
statute,
in
1974,
that
authorized
the
senate
committee
to
bring
the
action
in
court
to
challenge
the
assertion
of
executive
privilege.
there
were
no
private
parties.
the...
the
d.c.
circuit
did
exercise
jurisdiction
in
that
case.
and--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--i
believe
it
was
1974.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
well,
your
honor,
in
that
case,
the
statute
specifically
authorized
review.
the
executive
branch
has...
has
long,
i
think,
acknowledged
their
view
that
in
fact
the
congress
does
have
the
power
to
come
to
court
in
order
to
enforce
subpoenas.
the...
an
opinion
of
the
office
of
legal
counsel
has
taken
that
view.
and
really,
this
position
is...
is
firmly
rooted
in
this
court's
precedence
throughout
this
century
that
says
the
constitution
does
afford
congress
with
the
means
necessary
to
take
the...
to
use
compulsory
process
to
make
sure
that
it
gets
the
information
that
it
needs
for
its
legislative
functions.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
your
honor,
i
think
that
in
these
circumstances
where
it
is
a
narrow
cause
of
action,
it
is
one
that
is
expressly
created
for
this
precise
purpose,
where
the
branches
have
reached
an
impasse,
have
tried
to
work
it
out,
and
it
is--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--your
honor,
the
fact
that
it
is
the
composition
of
the
house
itself
is
very
important
here.
because
that
is
a
concrete
interest
under
this
court's
decision
in
67th
minnesota
senate,
where
it
found
that
a
state
legislative
body
that
was
directly
affected
by
orders
pertaining
to
its
own
composition
did
have
standing,
did
have
cognizable
interests--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--no,
your
honor,
it
wasn't.
but
it
did
go
to
the
issue...
i
think
we
have
to
separate
the
issues
here.
and...
and
one
is
whether
these
are
cognizable
at
all
within
an
article
iii
sense.
and
i
think
certainly
this
court's
decision
in...
in
beans
establishes
that
the
compositional
interests,
a
legislative
body's
compositional
interest,
is
cognizable.
and
it
is
firmly
rooted
in
the
text.
it
is
something
that
cong...
that
the
house
has
guarded
throughout
its
history
and
has
made
every
effort
to
make
sure
that
the
size
of
the
delegation
conformed
to
the
constitutional
requirements.
and
of
course
here
that
constitutional
requirement
is
that
the
numbers
be
determined
in
accordance
with
an
actual
enumeration.
and--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--well,
your
honor,
i
think
in...
in
the
nixon
case,
this
court...
the
judge
nixon
case...
this
court
said
that
of
course
the
version
that
was
ultimately
adopted
by
the
convention
is
the
one
that
is
entitled
to
the
most
weight.
and
i
think
if
we
look
at
the...
at
the
way
this
proceeded,
it
was
first
that
a
census
be
taken.
it
was
then
that
the
numbers
be
taken.
and
it
was
then
that
an
actual
enumeration
be
taken.
and
that
it...
the
best
reading,
of
course,
is
that
the
actual
enumeration
was
most
consistent
with
what
was
intended
from
the
outset.
and
if
we
look
to
what
the
1790
congress
thought
those
words
meant...
i'd
like
to
expand
on
what
the
solicitor
general
said
here,
because
i...
i
think
perhaps
he
left
the
impression
that
there
was
authority
to
use
estimates.
and
in
fact
it's
quite
the
contrary.
that
even
though
at
the
time
the...
the
states
were
very
familiar
with
how
to
do
estimations...
and
thomas
jefferson
himself
had
done
an
estimation
of
the
population
of
virginia
in
1792
that
is
thought
to
have
been
very
accurate...
the
1790
act
specifically
requires
that
the
marshals
only
prepare
schedules
that
list
every
household
in
the
nation,
identify
the
number
of
people
in
the
household,
the
sex
and
the
age,
and
provides
that
the...
the...
they
can
only
report
the
aggregate
amount
of
each
description
of
persons
within
their
respective
districts.
in
other
words,
they
can
only
report
the
people
who
have
been
described.
and
madison,
at
the
time
that
this
was
adopted,
referred
to
the
fact
in
the
debates
that...
of
the
difficulty
of
taking
the
census
in,
quote,
the
way
required
by
the
constitution.
and
i
think
there
really
is
not
much
doubt,
from
the
1790
practice,
which
of
course
has
been
followed
all
throughout
history--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--i
think
they
can
ask
the
neighbors.
they
can
ask
the
postman.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
they--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--your
honor,
they
can't
guess.
when
it's
all
said
and
done--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--that's
right.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
it
is
an
objective
standard.
the
whole
point
here
was
that
the
framers
said,
we
want
an
objective
standard.
we
do
not
want
something
that
will
invite
subjective--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--i
think
so,
your
honor.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
your
honor,
it
certainly...
maybe
in
some
sense
you
could
say
it
would
be
more
accurate
to
put
one
than
zero.
but
we
know
that
in
1790,
i
mean
if
a
bridge
went
out
and
they
couldn't
get
to
a
town,
they
couldn't
put...
put
it
down
on
their
schedule
unless
they
had
the
name
and
could
identify
the
people.
and
they
were
subject
to
fines
if
they
included--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--your
honor,
then...
then
the
house
will
suffer
the
injury.
the
problem
here,
unlike
most
circumstances,
is
the
house's
injury
cannot
be
solved
through
its
own
unilateral
action.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
your
honor,
if
i
could
go
first
to
the
example
of
withholding
money
for
the
census.
if...
if
the
house
withholds
money
for
the
census--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--if
i
could...
if
i
could
answer
justice
ginsburg's
question.
withholding
money
for
the
census
of
course
will
cause
the
harm.
because
the
house
will
be
un...
unlawfully
composed
in
2...
in
2002.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
withholding...
well,
what
we
can
say,
your
honor,
is
that
they
tried
to
pass
legislation
which
would
reaffirm
the
prohibition
in
section
195.
in
fact,
it
said
195
prohibits
the
use
of
sampling
for
purposes
of
apportionment.
it
did
that
in
disaster
relief
legislation.
and
the
president,
nevertheless,
vetoed
it.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
your
honor--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--your
honor,
i
think
that
this
has
become
an
intractable
controversy.
it
is
one
where
there
really
is
no
reasonable
solution.
the
parties
determined
that
there
were
concrete
injuries
here
and
that
this
was
a
reasonable
solution.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
your
honor--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--that's
absolutely
correct.
if
they
have
standing,
this
court
need
not...
not
reach
the
issue--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--in...
in
the
other
case?
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
i'm
sorry.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
in...
in
that
case,
i
think
mr.
carvin
will
be
speaking
to
the...
to
the
issue
of
standing
in
the...
in
the
private
plaintiff
case.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
but
i
do
think
that
there
are...
there
certainly
is
substantial
evidence
to
indicate
that
there
will
be
harm
to
the
individuals.
and
it
doesn't
have
to
be
proven
with
any
degree
of
certainty.
we
are
talking
here
about
a
procedure
that
was
established
by
the
framers
and
also
by
the
congress
to
prevent
the
use
of
sampling.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
that's--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--the
house
subpoena
witnesses
on
a
regular
basis
i
believe,
your
honor.
and
the
house
has
come
to
court...
i
mean,
excuse
me...
the
senate
has
come
to
court
in
order
to
enforce
its
subpoenas.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
i
think
approximately
six
or
seven
times.
and
i
believe
only
once
against
the
executive
branch.
and
that
was
when--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--your
honor,
i
really
believe
that
was
rejected
in
united
states
v.
nixon.
there,
this
court
was
confronted
with
a
situation
where
the
president
said,
this
is
not
a
case
or
controversy
because
i
have
invoked
executive
privilege,
my
subordinate
disagrees
with
me,
he
cannot
come
to
court
to
challenge
my
decision
invoking
executive
privilege,
this
is
not
a
case
or
controversy,
and
this
court
unanimously
held
that
the
fact
that
both
parties
are
members,
officials
of
the
executive
branch
cannot
be
viewed
as
a
barrier
to
suit,
because
we
have
to
look
behind
the
captions.
and
one
of
the
things
that
this
court
stressed
is
that
there
was
a
regulation
in
place
at
the
time,
of
the
department
of
justice,
which
authorized
the
executive
branch
official
to
come
to
court
in
order
to
get
issues
of
executive
privilege
resolved,
and
this
court
said,
we
must
respect
and
enforce
that
regulation.
and
i
submit,
your
honor,
that
if
there
is
reason
to
decide
that
controversy
based
upon
the
fact
that
there
was
a
regulation
in
place,
that
certainly
when
the
president
has
signed
legislation
that
authorizes
us
to
come
and
have
this
controversy
resolved,
that
provides
an
even
greater
basis
to
respect
and
enforce
the
judgment
of
the
united
states
government
that
it
is
appropriate
to
resolve
this
controversy,
especially
where
the
issue
here
is
not
one
that
is
of
the
type
that
raises
special
sensitivities
of
prosecutorial
discretion,
or
even
executive
privilege.
it
just
how
to
interpret
the
constitution
in
the
census
act.
and
those
issues
have
been
subject
to
review
in
this
court
several
times
in
the
last
decade,
so
i
think
that
this
really
was
a
very
appropriate
response,
especially
where
here
the
house
itself
is
essentially
captive
to
the
executive
branch's
decision
to
proceed
with
an
unlawful
plan
that's
going
to
alter
its
composition
and
deprive
it
of
the
information
that
it
needs
in
order
to
take
corrective
action
or
pass
new
apportionment
legislation.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
your
honor,
we
have
not
made
that
part
of
our
case
because
our
standing
derives
from
the
interest
in
protecting
the
house's
composition,
which
pertains
to
the
size
of
the
delegations
in
the
states,
but
i
do
not...
so
we
haven't
briefed
the
issue,
but
i
do
not
think
that
it
is
at
all
clear
that
that
is
the
correct
answer
to
the
question.
i
think
when
you
read
the
census
act
it
certainly
indicates
that
the
tabulation
of
population
that
is
done
in
the
decennial
census
is
supposed
to
be
made
without
the
use
of
sampling,
and
that
it
does
not
authorize
the
secretary
to
go
and
make
some
different
tabulation
of
population.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
i
think
that's
correct,
the
population
numbers,
unless
congress
steps
in
and
authorizes
it,
and--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--actually,
your
honor,
i
think
141
clearly
is
a
general
reference
to
the
secretary's
authority
to
use
sampling.
of
course,
the
decennial
census
covers,
it's
not
so
much
funding
and
that
sort
of
thing,
it's
the
myriad
of
information
that
has
to
be
collected.
the
decennial
census
is
the
census
of
population
and
housing
and
matters
pertaining
to
population
and
housing.
that's
probably
30-some
subjects
that
gets
addressed,
and
really
the
point
of
195,
and
the
point
of
141,
is
to
allow
the
secretary
the
authority
to
use
sampling
to
make
inquiries
with
respect
to
all
of
that
kind
of
information,
but
not
to
determine
the
population
for
the
decennial
census.
certainly
to
determine
the
population
for
the
mid
decade
census.
195
would
allow
the
secretary
to
do
that,
but
i
don't
think
that
the
census
act
could
readily
be
read
to
support
the
view
that
the
secretary
is
required
to
go
out
and
conduct
an
actual
enumeration
of
everyone
in
the
united
states
by
household
under
the
decennial
census
and
then
go
back
and
do
it
over
using
sampling
for
other
purposes.
i
think
that
the
distinction
is
between
the
determination
of
the
population
in
the
decennial
and
the
gathering
of
all
the
other
information,
and
that
that
is
the
best
reading
of
the
act,
but
that
is
not...
it
is
not
actually
squarely
presented
by
our
case,
because
we
are
here
challenging
the
methods
that
are
being
used
to
determine
the
size
of
the
state
delegations.
i'd
also
like
to
just
make
it
clear
in
terms
of
what
actually
is
being
done
here
in
terms
of
sampling.
for
nonresponse
follow
up
there
will
basically
be
the
judgment
that
what
the
plan
provides
is
that
the
census
bureau
will
deliberately
not
try
to
go
and
find
out
who
lives
in
10
percent
of
the
households
in
the
country,
deliberately.
they
will
send
the
mailing,
and
that
will
be
that.
thank
you,
your
honor.
