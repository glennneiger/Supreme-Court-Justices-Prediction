mr.
seth
p.
waxman
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
article
i,
section
2,
clause
3
of
the
constitution
requires
that
representatives
be
apportioned
based
on
the
number
of
persons
in
each
state.
and
to
effectuate
that
requirement,
congress
is
directed
to
provide
for,
quote,
the
actual
enumeration,
to
occur
every
10
years,
in
such
manner
as
congress
shall
by
law
direct.
in
modern
times,
as
the
census
has
faced
increasing
challenges,
congress
has
delegated
authority
to
the
secretary
of
commerce
to
conduct
a
census
in
such
form
and
content
as
he
may
determine.
following
exhaustive
study
and
the
unanimous
recommendation
of
the
census
bureau,
the
national
academy
of
sciences,
and
other
professional
groups,
the
secretary
has
determined
that
for
the
2000
census,
employing
statistical
sampling,
in
addition
to
other
means
of
enumeration,
will
best
achieve
the
constitutional
goal
of
determining
the
number
of
persons
in
each
state.
the
important--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--that's
correct,
mr.
chief
justice.
if...
just
a
small
correction
in
the
premise
of
the
question.
there
are
three
methods
of
sampling
that
the
census
bureau
proposes
to
conduct.
one
is
not
challenged
by...
at
least
directly...
by
any
of
the
plaintiffs
in
this
case.
but
the
third
one,
the
integrated
cover
ment
measurement
portion
of
the
survey,
is
actually
quite
similar
in...
in
the
means
by
which
it
will
done...
is
going
to
be
done...
as
in
1990,
the
post
enumeration
survey
that
the
court
discussed
in
wisconsin
v.
city
of
new
york.
that
is,
after
the
first
two
phases
of
the
census
are
completed
and
there
is
an
initial
enumeration
roster
with
respect
to
every
census
block
and
tract,
the--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--that's
correct.
there
are...
there
are
three
phases,
mr.
chief
justice,
to
the
2000
census.
the
first
phase
will
be
a...
a
series
of
mailings
to
every
individual
household,
an
800
number
for
people
who
don't
want
to
respond
by
mail
to
call
in
their
answers,
the
distribution
of
questionnaires
in
malls
and
public
libraries
and
other
places.
that's
the
first
phase.
the
second
phase
involves
what's
called
non
response
follow
up.
and
that
includes
both
an
effort
to
physically
visit
a
certain
number...
up
to
90
percent
of
the
houses
in
each
census
tract,
and
the
use
of
statistical
sampling
to
impute
the
population
characteristics
with
respect
to
those
homes
which
did
not
send
in...
mail
in
their
census
information
and
were
not
located
personally.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
no,
there...
justice
scalia,
there
is
an
intentional
effort
in
this
census
to
obtain
census
information
from
every
household
that
is
known
to
exist
by
mailings,
by
a
be
counted
program,
by
telephone,
by
the
internet.
the
census
bureau
has
determined
that
in
order
to
make
the
population
totals
for
apportionment
purposes
more
accurate,
it
will
not
have
enumerators
physically
go
to
every
single
house
that
did
not
respond
to
those
initial
requests
for
information,
but
rather
will
go
to
enough
houses
so
that
90
percent
of
every
household
in
each
census
tract
has
been
the
subject
of
a,
quote,
physical
count.
and
it
will
then
use
statistical
sampling
on
a
completely
random
basis...
and
i
think
this
is
key,
because
none
of
the
plaintiffs
have
alleged,
nor
could
they,
that
they
have
been
injured
in
any
way
by
the
effort...
by
the
attempt
to
use
sampling--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--yes,
sir.
the...
once
the
initial
enumeration
roster
is
completed
by
means
of
the
mail
in,
the
non
response
follow
up,
which
is
both
physical
and
sampling,
the
national
vacancy
check,
which
uses
sampling
to
impute
population,
there
will
be
what's
called
an
initial
enumeration
roster.
the
bureau
will
then
conduct,
much
as
it
did
in
1990,
but
on
a
much
larger,
more
sophisticated
scale,
using
a
completely
separate
cadre
of
individuals,
it
will,
on
25,000
blocks
of
the
country,
selected
in
advance
according
to
methodologies
that
have
been
specified,
survey
intensively
every
single
one
of
those
households
to
determine
the
extent
to
which
the
people
show
up
the
second
time
that
weren't
identified
the
first
time
or
were
identified
the
first
time
and
weren't
identified
the
second
time.
and
any
discrepancy
in
information
that
any
person
gives
will
be
the
subject
of
a
follow
up
visit.
the
results
of
that
procedure,
the
inter...
integrated
coverage
measurement,
it
is
in
effect
a
quality
check
on
the
initial
enumeration
roster.
and
using
the
system
of
dual
system
estimation
that
the
court
described
better
in
wisconsin
v.
city
of
new
york
than
i
could
standing
here,
it
will
adjust
the
results
of
the
initial
enumeration
roster
to
more
accurately
reflect
the
total
number
of
persons
in
each
state,
district--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--yes.
the
in...
integrated
coverage
measurement
is
a
means,
a
highly
reliable
statistical
means,
of
correcting
for
inaccuracies.
that
is,
improving
the
quality
of
the...
the
results
of
the
initial
enumeration
roster.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
justice...
chief
justice
rehnquist,
there...
every
effort
to
enumerate
the
population,
from
the
1790
census
until
now,
has
produced
only
an
estimate
of
the
true
population
totals
in
each
state.
that's
agreed.
that's
understood.
we
now
have
the
means...
the...
the
census
bureau
and
statisticians
have
developed
the
means,
really
beginning
in
the
1940's
and
on,
to
be
able
to
ascertain
just
how
far
from
the
true
number
the
enumeration
efforts
are...
are--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--well,
the...
i
recall
that
was
the...
that
was
the
question
that
was
asked
of
my
predecessor
in
city
of
new
york
v.
wisconsin,
as
the
subject
of
an
explanation
in
the
court's
opinion
in
that
case.
and
i
don't
think
i
can
improve
upon
it.
but
the
demographers
and
statisticians
have
means
for
very
accurately
estimating
both
what
the
national
population
is
in
the
country,
using
something
called
demographic
analysis,
and
sub
national
population
totals,
using
a
combination
of
demographic
data
and
the
results
of
prior
censuses.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
well,
because
there...
there
is
a
requirement
in
the
constitution
that
every
10
years
the
respective
number
of
persons
in
each
state
be
determined.
that
is
the
constitutional
goal.
and
the
actualization
of
that
goal
is
the
actual
enumeration,
which
is
done
every
10
years
and
which
must
be
done
in
the
means...
manner
by
which
congress
directs.
now--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--well,
i
think
it
depends
how
you
define...
actual
enumer...
most
people
would
think
actual
enumeration
means
a
count
in
the
sense
of
determining
the
number
of
persons.
if...
if
i
am
told
to
conduct
an
actual
enumeration
of
the
people
in
camden
yards
during
an
oriole...
orioles
game
that
i'm
at,
and
i'm
given
30
minutes,
the
best
means
that
i
may
have
to
do
that
is
by
a
statistical
sampling
of
some
sort,
rather
than
trying
to
count
people
one
by
one.
i--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--well,
the
words
"the
actual
enumeration"
i
don't
think
would
come
up
very
likely
in
the
context
of
camden
yards.
but
if
one
is
talking
about
what
the
constitutional
phrase
means,
justice
scalia,
i
think
it's
very,
very
important
to
look
at
the
actual
wording
of
the
constitution...
this
constitutional
clause,
which
is
included
on
page
1a
of
each
of
our
opening
briefs.
the
first
sentence
states
the
constitutional
goal.
that
is,
that
you
base
apportionment
on
the
total
number
of
persons
in
each
state.
the
second
sentence
actualizes
that
goal.
the
very
first
words
of
the
second
sentence
says:
the
actual
enumeration.
that
is
the...
the...
the
determination
of
the
number
of
persons
in
each
state.
and
by
what
manner
shall
it
be
conducted?
every
10
years
and
in
the
manner
by
which
they
shall
choose.
those
are
the
words
of
the
constitution.
and
in
fact--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--they
very...
i'm
sorry.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
well,
the...
the--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--well,
we
know
for--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--"actual"
was
defined
then
as
it
is
now
as
that
which
comprises
action.
that
is,
it
is...
the
enumeration
will
really
be
done.
the
data
will
be
collected
by
the
federal
government
every
10
years
and
tabulated
to
determine
the
number
of
persons
in
each
state.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
well--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--you
see,
that
is
our
understanding
of
what
it
means.
it...
it
is
an
emphatic
adjective.
they
could
have
said
"the
enumeration".
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
i
don't
think
so.
i
think
if
they
had
said
"the
enumeration
shall
be
conducted
every
10
years.
"
it
would
have
been
clear
in
light
of
the
goal,
and
particularly
in
light
of
the
concerns
that
were
expressed
during
the
proceedings
of
the
constitutional
convention,
that
reliance
not
be
had
on
existing
state
records,
or
efforts
by
individual
states
to
produce--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--that's--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--yes.
in
fact,
it...
it...
the
records
of
the...
in
the
records
of
the
proceedings,
the...
the
phrase
is
actually
used
"actual
census",
in
contradistinction
to,
quote,
conjectural
ratio,
which
is
what
the
framers
understood
they
were
doing
in
the
first
apportionment.
that
is--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--that's
right.
the...
the
actual
enumeration
refers
to
the...
a
good
faith,
empirical
effort
to
determine
the
number
of
persons
within
each
state.
which
is
the
goal
of
the
first
sentence
of
article
i,
section
2,
clause
3.
and
the
record
of
the
proceedings,
the...
the
various
debates
and
the...
and
the
successive
drafts
of
what
became
the
census
clause,
are
all
focused
on
determining
the
number
of
persons.
edmund
randolph's
original
suggestion
and
the
draft
constitution
that
was
approved
by
the
convention
spoke
of
determining
the
number
of
persons.
and
none
of
the
drafts
that
occurred
in
between
and
none
of
the
debates
that
occurred
in
between
differed
materially
from
that
or
evidenced
any
concern
whatsoever
about
the
means
by
which
that
number
would
be
determined
except
in
two
respects:
one,
that
it
be
conducted
at
preset
regular
intervules...
intervals,
which
eventually
became
10
years;
and,
two,
that
it
be
conducted
in
a
manner
in
which
they...
that
is,
congress...
shall
determine.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
there
certainly
were
not
the
options
that
are
available
now
in
many,
many
respects.
they
didn't
have
available
to
them,
as
we
have
had
since
1940,
imputation
techniques.
they
didn't
have--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--we...
we
have
a
very
good
record
of
how
the
early
censuses
were
taken.
and
there
is
a...
a
scholarly
text
that
is
cited
in
our
brief...
i
think
it's
called
200
years
of
census
taking>
["]...
that
goes
quite
methodically
through.
but
if
you
look
at
the
first
census
act,
the
census
act
of
1790,
the
very
first
sentence
in
that
act...
it's
chapter
2,
section
1...
essentially
equates
enumeration
with,
quote,
cause
the
number
of
inhabitants
to
be
taken.
and
when
it
then
goes
ahead
and
talks
about
the
oath
that
the
marshals
who
would
be
collecting
this
information
from
each
household
had
to
take,
that
they
would
make
a
just
and
perfect
enumeration
and
transfer
the
enumeration
to
washington,
it
then
goes
on,
in
section
3,
to
make
clear
that
what
it
is
that
they
were
transferring
was,
quote,
the
aggregate
amount
of
persons.
and
so
we
think
those
two
sources,
plus
the
capitation
clause
of
the
constitution,
which
equates
the
actual
enumeration
with
census--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--they--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--that...
well,
it
prob...
apparently,
according
to
the
records
of
the
convention,
was
somewhat
cruder
than
that.
because
when
they
actually
did
the
initial
allocation,
some
states
were
given
additional
members
based
on
the
representation
that
their
population
would
grow
or
was
likely
to
grow.
that's
why
it
was
a
conjectural
ratio.
but,
justice--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--justice
scalia--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--the...
the
point
here...
i
think
that
there
is...
it's
easy
to
say,
you
know,
they
talked
about
an
actual
enumeration,
not
an
actual
estimate.
but
if
one
understands
the
words
"the
actual
enumeration"
as
an
empirical,
good
faith
process
to
come
up
with
the
best
approximation
of
the
number
of
persons.
it
may
very
well
have
been...
indeed,
i
think
it
was
true,
as
justice
o'connor
suggested...
that
the
best
means
for
doing
that
in
1787
and
1790
and
in
successive
decades
was
to
get
federal
employees
to
go
visit
ho...
as
many
homes
as
possible,
and
ask
them
how
many
people
are
in...
in
those
houses.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
well,
i...
with
all
respect,
i
don't
know
how
likely
it
would
have
been
to
have
been
used
then,
justice
scalia.
it's
a
long,
long
time
before
i
have
any
empirical,
firsthand
knowledge.
but
i
do
know
that
there
is...
that
the
secretary
has
determined,
with
the
su...
overwhelming
support
of
the
scientific
statistical
community,
that
the
actual
number
of
persons
in
each
state
will
be
determined
with
a
significantly
higher
degree
of
accuracy
by
the
use
of
the
science
of
statistical
probability
than
the
estimate
that
will
be
produced
relying
on
methods
that
have
been--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--the...
the...
under
section
141(a)
of
the--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--the
constitution
doesn't
speak
to--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--correct.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
your...
your--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--if
i
understand
your
point--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--it's
precisely
the
same
basis
for
secretary
mosbacher's
determination
in
not...
in
1991,
not
to
adjust
the
physical
enumeration
with
the
results
of
a
post
enumeration
survey.
and
we
were
here
just
a
few
years
ago
defending
the
reasonable...
the
lawfulness
of
that
determination
as
a
reasonable
determination,
based
on
the
fact
that
the
secretary
was
unable
to
conclude
that
although
the...
the
total
popu...
there
would
be
greater
total
accuracy
if
the
physical
enumeration
results
were
adjusted,
he
could
not
conclude
that
there
would
be
greater
distributional
accuracy.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
that...
that
is
precisely
the
point.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
and
not
only
has
the
census
bureau
and
three
national
academy
of
sciences
panels,
that
congress
directed
the
census
bureau
to
work
with
and
refer
to,
concluded
that,
but
we've...
we've
cited
in
our
reply
brief
the
general
accounting
office
has
cited
that
particular
strength
of
this
as
a
principal
benefit
of
conducting
the
19...
the
2000
census
in
the
manner
in
which
the
secretary
proposes
he
do
it.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
approximately.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
well--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--it's--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--it's
right
to
the
extent
that
the...
the
census
bureau
has
determined,
for
a
variety
of
reasons...
that
i
can
explain
to
the
court
if
it
wishes...
the
census
bureau
has
determined
that,
unlike
in
1990,
when
it
conducts
the
non
response
follow
up
portion...
that
is,
who
didn't
mail
in
anything
from
their
home
or
from
a
mall,
or
who
didn't
call
us
or
send
us
their
information
by

they
are
not
going
to
attempt
to
have
a
physical
follow
up
visit
with
every
home
in
every
block.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
there's
25,000
census
blocks.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
i
don't
know
that
we'll
be
going
to
the
extent
of
digging
up
everybody,
but--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--but
i
think...
i
have...
i--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--when
we
talk...
when
we
talk
about
actual
residents,
we're
generally
referring
to
people
who
have--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--the
ability
to
be
vertical.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
but
can
i...
can
i
just--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--can
i
just
correct
one--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--i
want
to
make
sure
that
the
court
is
not
under
a
misapprehension
as
to
how
the
icm
is
going
to
work.
for
the
25,000
blocks
that
are
chosen
for
retest
during
the
second...
in
the
icm
phase,
the
initial
enumeration
will
have
a
physical
visit
in
the
non
response
follow
up
phase
to
every
home.
that
is,
there
will
be
no
sampling
for
non
response
follow
up
in
the
25,000
blocks
that
are
going
to
be
the
subject
of
the
icm.
because
the
purpose
of
the
icm
is
to
determine
the
accuracy
or
determine
the
quality
of
the
initial
enumeration
effort.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
now
i'm
ready
for
your
question.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
it--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--well,
what
will
happen
as
a
result
of...
in
the
icm
process,
the...
the
results
of
the
icm
and
the
results
of
the
initial
enumeration
phases
will
be
very
carefully
compared.
the
differences
will
be
reconciled,
and...
according
to
different
categories
of
persons,
according
to
demographic
characteristics,
according
to
post
strata.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
well,
the
first
phase...
one
cannot
arrive
at
the...
under
the...
under
the
census
2000
plan,
one
cannot
arrive
at
the
number
of
persons
in
each
state
without
both
phases.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
it...
you...
you
just
couldn't
do
it...
we're
not
proposing
to
do
what
sometimes
has
been
referred
to
as
a
sample
census.
that
is,
we
have
a
phase
at
which
we
are
attempting
to
obtain
information
from
every
household
in
the
united
states,
and
a
phase...
and
this
is
what
aggrieves
the
plaintiffs...
a
phase
at
which
we
will
use
a
sample
to
adjust
for
errors
that
inevitably
occur
in
the
initial
traditional
physical
means
of
enumeration.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
april
1st
is
census
day.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
no.
although
one
of
the
great
sources
of
error
is
that
people
fill
out
their
questionnaires
later
or,
in
non
response
follow
up,
somebody
may
come
to
the
household
in
july
or
september
and
they
count
somebody
who
was
born
after
that
day,
or
somebody
who
had
died
the
day
before.
or
they
show
up
to
do
the
post
enumeration...
the...
the
non
response
follow
up
in
south
florida
in
july
and
discover
that
all
the
residences
are
apparently
vacant.
i
mean
one
of
the
things
that
i
think
it's
important
for
the
court
to
recognize,
because
what
the
census
bureau
is
proposing
to
do
now
is
something
that
is
significantly
different
than
what
has
been
done
before.
but
it's
not
as
sharply
different
as
the
other
side,
i
think,
would
suggest.
since
19--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--practically,
the
answer
to
this
question...
if
the
court
agrees
with
us,
will
make
conducting
the
decennial
census
much
easier,
cheaper
and
more
efficient
for
the
bureau.
but
if
this
court
were
to
determine
that
sampling,
neither
sampling
in
the
non
response
follow
up
stage
or
in
the
national
vacancy
check
stage
or...
or
icm,
could
permissibly
be
used
under
the...
under
the
statute
or
the
constitution
for
determ...
for
apportionment
purposes,
the
secretary
would
be...
is
required
under
section
195
to
use
sampling
in
census
taking
for
all
other
purposes;
that
is,
intrastate,
district--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--i
think,
justice...
justice
ginsburg,
it's
clear
that
if
we
lost
this
case
on
the
merits,
the
census
bureau
would
proceed
and
conduct
the
census
for...
for
apportionment
purposes
without
the
use
of
any
sampling
in
the
non
response
follow
up
stage.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
they
would...
they
would
do
that
the
way
they
did
it
in
1990.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
they
would
then...
the
secretary
would
then
need
to
determine
whether
it
is
feasible...
and
it
certainly
does
not
seem
infeasible...
to
go
ahead
and
conduct
the
icm...
that
is,
the
integrated
coverage
measurement
survey,
and
adjust
all
other
state...
all
other
population
totals...
that
is,
for
federal
funding
purposes
or
districting
purposes...
and
produce--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--those
are
the...
those
are
the
principal
purposes
of
the
decennial
census
that
the
secretary
is
required
and
authorized
to
conduct
under
section
141(a).
there
are
other
provisions
of
the
census
act
that
authorize
the
secretary
and
the
bureau
to
conduct
empirical
surveys
and
censuses
for
other
persons.
for
example,
upon
request
by
any
state
or
local
government.
but
the
point
is
that...
and
this
actually
goes
to
the...
directly
to
the
standing
of
the
glavin
plaintiffs...
the
point
is
that
no
matter
what
this
court
decides
with
respect
to
the
issue
presented
in
this
case,
the
secretary
will
be
required,
if
he
considers
it
feasible,
to
use
sampling
in
determining
all
population
totals
for
all
purposes
other
than
the
apportionment
of
representatives
among
the
states.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
i
was
just
waiting
to
be
asked.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
that
is
absolutely
correct.
with
respect
to
standing,
let
me
just
say
the
following
few
things.
the
house
of
representatives
is
attempting
to
direct,
through
litigation,
the
execution
of
the
census
laws.
but
under
our
system
of
separated
powers,
legislation,
not
litigation,
is
the
means
by
which
congress
gets
this
done.
the
constitution
provides
that
the
census
shall
be
conducted
in
such
manner
as
congress
shall,
by
law,
direct,
not
by
lawsuit.
with
respect
to
the
glavin
plaintiffs,
they
have
virtually
abandoned
the
claim
that
they
will
suffer
injury
in
any
manner
protected
by
the
constitution
or
the
act.
none
of
them
has
established
that
it
is
imminent,
or
certainly
impending,
that
the
secretary's
plan
will
cause
his
or
her
state
to
lose
a
seat.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
justice
o'connor--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--that
is
what
the
ex...
that
is
what
dr.
webber--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--for
indiana,
he
concluded
that
it
was
virtually
certain.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
it
is
sig...
very...
we
controverted
that,
both
in
terms
of
challenging
the
methodology
that
he
used
and
his
specific
conclusion
about
indiana.
and
it
is
perhaps
for
that
reason
that
the
district
court
did
not
find
that
it
was
likely
or
imminent
that
indiana
would
lose
a
seat.
and
here
is
what
mr.
glavin's
counsel
told
the
court
about
indiana
in
the
court
below,
at
page
85
of
the
transcript.
he
said:
the
government
spent
all
its
time
disputing
whether
or
not
indiana
was
going
to
lose
a
congressional
seat
on
the
basis
of
dr.
webber's
data.
to
simplify
this
case,
we'll
concede
it;
indiana
is
not
going
to
lose
a
house
seat.
i
don't
care.
it
doesn't
matter.
because
there's
intrastate
vote
dilution.
we
don't
think
that
for
purposes
of
summary
judgment
against
the
government
the
district
court
could
conclude,
or
this
court
could
conclude,
that
it
was
imminent
or
certainly
impending
that
indiana
would
likely
lose
a
seat.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
well,
i...
that
is
true
as
far
as
you've
taken
it,
mr.
chief
justice.
our
position
is,
leaving
aside...
even
if
one
accepts
the
facts
as
alleged
below
and
not
conceded
below,
the
district
court
made
findings
of
fact.
it
did
not
find
that
indiana
was
likely
to
lose
a
seat.
and
there
simply
is
not
a
cause
to
conclude
that
any
other
state
is
either
imminent
or
actually
impending
in
loss
of
a
seat
under
the
method
of
equal
proportion.
and
the
reason
is--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--no,
not
at
all.
it's
very
important
to
do
it.
i
am
just...
we
are
suggesting...
and
i
will
at
this
point
be
the
first
to
say
that
i
may
be
wrong
on
this.
this
court,
over
the
last
term,
has
disagreed
with
the
government's
position
on
standing
in
many
cases.
but
it
seems
to
us
that
the
plaintiffs
in
this
case
are
seeking
an
advisory
opinion.
the
glavin
plaintiffs,
none
of
them
have
shown
the...
what
this
court
considers
injury
in
fact,
that--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--well,
i
think,
certainly
after
the
census
is
taken,
it
could
be
challenged
in
the
way
that...
that--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--no,
i
don't
think
a
remedy
would
be
to
require
that
the
census
be
done
over
again.
and
this
court
has...
has...
has
considered
challenges
to
the
means
by
which
the
census
has
been
conducted
after
the
fact
on
several
occasions.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
well--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--the...
you
have...
you
have
to
prove
that
you
likely...
that
your
state
like--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--not...
not--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--not
at
all.
not
at
all.
the
census
bureau
will
publish,
as
it's
required
to
by
law
after
the
census
is
conducted,
the
results
of
the
mail
in
procedures,
the
results
of
the
non
response
follow
up
results;
that
is,
both
the
physical
efforts
at
non
response
follow
up
and
the
100
percent
non
response
follow
up,
using
ran...
sampling
on
a
random
basis.
all
of
those
numbers
will
be
available
to
plaintiffs
after
the
fact--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--mr.
chief
justice,
courts
use
imperfect
census
data
all
the
time,
particularly
in
districting...
redistricting
cases
that
occur
long
after
the
census
is
conducted.
and
i
acknow...
we
acknowledge
that
devising
remedies
for
a
violation
is
frequently
a
difficult
task.
what
the
court
probably
should
do
is
re...
would
do
in
that
instance
is
remand
to
the
secretary
for
a
determination
of
the
likely
consequences,
if
any,
under
the
method
of
equal
proportions.
it
may
very
well
be...
we
don't
have
to
reach
it
in
this
case...
that
the
90
percent
number
that
is,
quote,
the
way
it's
always
been
done
in
the
past,
is
sufficient
to
constitute
an
actual
enumeration.
i'd
just
like
to
say
a
few
words
about
the...
the
statute,
where...
which
i
haven't
had
the
opportunity
to
address
today.
but
it's
our
view
that
section
141(a)
of
the
census
act
has...
it
could
not
possibly
be
clearer.
it
is
the
only
command
in
the
code
for
the
secretary
to
conduct
the
decennial
census
and
the
apportionment
census.
and
the
language
has
an
entirely--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--exactly.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
you...
you--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--we
think
that
the
only
way
to
harmonize
the
reading
of
the
two
statutes
is
to
read
the
except
proviso
of
195
as
meaning
what
it
says.
which
means
this
isn't
saying
anything
about
the
apportionment
census.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
before
it
was
amended
in
'76,
justice
o'connor,
everybody
thought--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--i'm
answering
your...
i'm
trying
to
answer
your
question.
everybody
thought
that
sampling
in
the
apportionment
census...
at
least
sampling
in
lieu
of
an
effort
to
reach
everybody...
was
prohibited.
what
we
submit
to
the
court
is
that
it
was
not
that
clause...
sampling
was
prohibited
before
195
was
enacted
because...
for
two
reasons.
there
was
a
provision,
section...
old
section
25(c)
of
the
census
act...
that
required
that
an
enumerator
visit
every
house
and
record
the
number
of
persons
present.
and
a
sample
in
lieu
of
that
would
have
been
impermissible.
there
was
also
a...
a
determin...
i
don't
know
about
a
determination...
but
both
the
congress,
in
'57,
and
the
bureau,
in
'57,
indicated
that
a
sample
census
or
a
sample
survey
would
not
be
consistent
with
the
statutory
term
"census".
and
in
1976...
well
25(c)
was
repealed
in
1964.
and
with
respect
to
the
implicit
meaning
of
the
word
1976,
congress
said
in
the
most
direct
way
it
could
that
the
census
should
be
conducted
in
such
form
and
content
as
the
secretary
may
determine,
including
the
use
of
sampling
procedures.
now,
the
reading
that
the
other
side
wants
to
give
this
would...
that
is,
that
section
195
prohibits
sampling
for
apportionment
purposes
and
requires
it
where
feasible
for
all
other
purposes,
deprives
that
amendment
of
section
141(a)
of
any
meaning
at
all.
there's
nothing
left
for
those
words
to
do.
and
what's
most
significant
to
us
is
that
by
the
time
congress
enacted
this
amendment
in
1976,
the
census
bureau
had
been
using
imputation
techniques...
in
1940,
in
1950,
in
1960,
in
1970,
and
in
1970...
and
this
was
known...
this
was
published
by
the
census
bureau
and
the
subject
of
discussions
in
mentions
in
house
reports
and
in
hearings...
the
census
bureau
had
used
statistical
sampling
in
two
different
respects
in
the
1970
census
to
correct
the
state
population
totals
by
one
and
a
half
million
people.
there
was
a
sampling
used
in
the
national
vacancy
check
and
sampling
used
in
something...
in
the
southern
states...
in
something
called
peapock.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
our
first
argument
is
that
whichever
provision
is
more
specific
or
more
general,
the
first
principle
of
statutory
construction
is
to
read
the
two
provisions
to
the
extent...
in
a
manner
in
which
harmonizes
them
if
that
can
be
done.
but
if
this
comes
down
to
specific
versus
general,
section
141(a)
is
much
more
specific.
it
is
the
only
provision
that
directs
or
allows
the
census
bureau
to
conduct
the
apportionment
census.
in
fact,
141(b)
makes
it
clear
that's
what's
being
required
in
141(a)
is
the
apportionment
census.
section
195,
which
talks
about
sampling,
refers
not
just
to
the
decennial
census
or
censuses
in
general,
it
refers
to
anything
that
the
secretary
will
do
under
this
chapter.
may
i
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time,
please?
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
justice
stevens,
you
were
asking
about
what
happens...
asking
ms.
mahoney
what
happens
if
no
one's
home,
and
the
implications
of
her
answer
is
that
what
the
census
bureau
has
done
consistently
since
1940
is
unconstitutional
in
their
view,
because
since
1940
the
census
bureau
has
been
using
imputation
techniques
to
assign
population
figures
to
residences
or
locations
that
are
known
to
exist
but
where
it
is
not
known
whether
anybody
lives
there
or
not.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
excuse
me?
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
it's
not
under
challenge
here,
but
it's
highly
relevant,
justice
scalia,
to
the
question
of
whether
what
has
been
going
on
and
what
the
constitution
requires
is
a
"head
count".
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
since
1940.
similarly--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--similarly,
it's
also
highly
relevant
to
the
meaning
of
the
1976
amendment
that
gave
the
secretary
the
authority
under
141(a)
to
use
whatever
means
he
thought
desirable,
including
sampling,
that
in
1970
there
was
not
just
imputation
but
statistical
sampling
in
two
different
instances
that
added
1.5
million
people
to
the
initial
enumeration
total.
now,
the
plaintiffs
in
the
case
have
made
much
of
the
fact
that
there
is
little
legislative
history
to
support
the
notion
that
congress
in
1976
affirmatively
wanted
to
permit
sampling,
but
the
legislative
history
on
their
side
both
on
1976
and
in
1957
is
deafening.
there
were
hearings
all
the
time
in
the
1970's
about
what
the
census
bureau
was
doing,
and
the
undercount,
and
talked
about
what
they
had
done.
the
census
bureau
had
published
reports
about
what
it
had
done
in
1970
to
use
sampling
to
correct
for
the
undercount.
in
1976
they
had
a
hearing
about
using
dual
system
estimation
to
correct
the
1980
undercounts,
and
there
is
not
one
word
in
the
reports
that
accompanied
the
1976
amendments
or
any
of
the
debates
that
suggested
that
anybody
thought
there
was
anything
wrong
with
using
statistical
sampling
to
increase
the
accuracy
of
the
effort
to
count
to
get
information
from
every
person.
on
the
issue
of
house
standing,
as
anybody--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--justice
scalia,
the
census
bureau
and
the
national
academy
of
science
panels
and
the
gao
all
agree
that
the
bureau's
method
for
conducting
the
nonresponse
follow
up,
which
uses
some
statistical
sampling,
will
be
at
least
as
accurate
as
if
they
had
done
physical
nonresponse
follow
up,
and
it
will
increase
the
overall
accuracy
of
the
census
because
it
will
be
conducted
in
5
weeks
rather
than
14
weeks
and
permit
the
icm
part
of
the
process
to
be
conducted
with
more...
better
trained
people,
and
at
a
time
that
is
closer
to
census
day.
it
has
been
recognized...
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
