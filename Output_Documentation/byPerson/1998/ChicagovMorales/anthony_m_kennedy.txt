justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
just
one
question.
do
the
police
have
special
training
and
instructions
to
know
who
members
of
the
gangs
are?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
it
takes
some
experience
and
expertise
to
know
this?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well
then,
how
does
the
person
who's
not
a
member
of
the
gang
know
that
he
is
doing
something
unlawful?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
does
the
police
tell
the
person
who
is
not
a
gang
member,
this
is
a
gang
member
and
therefore
you
must
disperse?
does
he
say
that?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
how
does
the
person
know?
how
does
the
nongang
member
know
that
the
other
person's
a
gang
member?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
you
were
going
to
mention
kolender,
and
that's
on
this
same
point
as
justice
ginsburg
made.
i
think
the
court
was
very
careful
to
say
that
what
we're
really
concerned
about
in
kolender
was
that
the
police
have...
there
are
no
standards
to
guide
the
police
for
when
it's
going
to
enforce
the
order.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
the
opinion
says
the
important
thing
is
that
there
be
minimal
guidelines
to
those
who
enforce
the
ordinance.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
it
seems
to
me
we
can't
affirm,
or
rule
in
your
favor
unless
we
modify
that,
or
somehow
confine
it.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
that...
so
then
your
argument
has
very
little
to
do
with
the
fact
that
nongang
members
are
subject
to
this
ordinance.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
then
you're
arguing
it
has
very
little
to
do
with
the
fact
that
nongang
member
are
subject
to
this
ordinance,
then.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
if
it's
a
de
facto
obstruction
of
the
street
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
gang
membership,
then
your
ordinance
would
say,
any
group
of
10
or
more,
no
matter,
without
referencing...
justice
stevens
was
asking
you
about
gang
members.
