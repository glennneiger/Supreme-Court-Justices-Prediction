mr.
lawrence
rosenthal
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court--
as
the
record
before
the
chicago
city
council
makes
plain,
gang
crime
is
different
from
most
other
forms
of
criminal
activity.
most
criminals,
of
course,
do
not
commit
their
crimes
in
broad
daylight,
in
full
view
of
law
abiding
citizens,
and
on
the
public
way.
not
so
with
gang
crime.
street
gangs
rely
on
their
ability
to
so
terrorize
their
neighborhoods
that
they
may
commit
crimes
with
impunity
while
law
abiding
persons
are
afraid
to
cooperate
with
the
police,
indeed,
afraid
to
even
use
the
public
spaces
in
their
own
neighborhoods.
when
police
are
present,
however,
all
they
see
is
gang
members
pretending
to
innocently
loiter.
on
that
record,
the
city
council
enacted
the
gang
loitering
ordinance.
it
provides
that
whenever
a
police
officer
sees
a
group
of
loiterers
in
a
public
place
and
reasonably
believes
a
member
of
a
criminal
street
gang
to
be
present,
he
may
order
the
group
to
disperse.
this
morning,
i
will
discuss
the
two
holdings
below
and
explain
why
this
ordinance
is
neither
impermissibly
vague
nor
inconsistent
with
principles
of
substantive
due
process.
mr.
lawrence
rosenthal
the
general
order
that
govern
enforcement,
92
4...
it
is
in
the
petition
appendix...
contains
quite
explicit
instructions
and
demanding
standards
for
making
determinations
of
gang
membership
and,
of
course,
even
respondents
do
not
challenge--
mr.
lawrence
rosenthal
--it
does.
for
example,
under
the
order,
not
all
police
officers
are
permitted
to
enforce
this
ordinance,
only
gang
specialists,
tactical
officers,
and
other
specially
designated
personnel
familiar
with
the
gang
files
of
the
chicago
police
department
are
permitted
to
make
arrests
under
the
ordinance.
mr.
lawrence
rosenthal
well,
interestingly,
justice
kennedy,
the
critical
point
here
is
that,
on
the
question
of
fair
notice,
as
your
honor's
question
points
out,
it
is
not
unlawful
to
loiter
in
the
city
of
chicago.
when
one
loiters
with
a
gang
member
one
is
not
breaking
the
law.
under
this
ordinance,
it
is
a
crime
only,
after
having
received
an
order
to
disperse,
to
fail
to
obey
that
order,
order--
mr.
lawrence
rosenthal
--the
ordinance
does
not
provide
for
that?
mr.
lawrence
rosenthal
well,
what
the
person
has...
what
the
police
are
told,
what
the
police
do
is,
they
give
an
order
in
terms
of
common
parlance
to
disperse.
that
provides
fair
notice
of
what
the
constitution
requires,
how
to
conform
one's
conduct
with
the
requirement
of
the
law.
of
course,
individuals
ordinarily
ought
to
presume
that
when
police
issue
orders
they
do
so
for
appropriate
police
power
reasons.
presumably--
mr.
lawrence
rosenthal
--of
course,
the
way
to
test
the
order
is
in
court,
and
it
is
a
defense--
mr.
lawrence
rosenthal
--well,
the
traffic
laws
provide
a
good
example.
when
a
police
officer
refuses
to
let
cars
go
down
a
street,
we
know
of
no
principle
of
constitutional
law
that
says
the
police
officer
must
explain
why
that
street
has
been
closed
and
that
there
is
sufficient
ordinance
authority.
mr.
lawrence
rosenthal
justice
ginsburg,
we
think
that
that
is
what
this
law
reads
for
purposes
of
fair
notice.
the--
mr.
lawrence
rosenthal
--we
think
it
would
supply
fair
notice.
there
might
be
other
problems
with
an
ordinance.
mr.
lawrence
rosenthal
well,
that
ordinance
is
so
broad
it
might
reach
picketing
demonstrations,
activity
protected
by
the
first
amendment.
what
people
are
told
on
a
point
of
fair
notice
is
what
they
must
do,
disperse.
now,
there
are
other
standards
for
enforcement
under
the
ordinance.
mr.
lawrence
rosenthal
well,
again,
i...
we
think
that
that
would
be--
mr.
lawrence
rosenthal
--that...
and
we
think
this
case
is
no
different,
justice--
mr.
lawrence
rosenthal
--we
do,
at
least
on
the
question
of
fair
notice.
there
might
be
other
issues
about
whether
their
enforcement
discretion
has
been
circumscribed
or
not.
mr.
lawrence
rosenthal
if
those
guide--
mr.
lawrence
rosenthal
--well--
mr.
lawrence
rosenthal
--i
think
on
a
facial
challenge,
one
could
bring
a
facial
challenge
to
such
an
ordinance
and
if
the
police
refused
to
disclose
the
guidelines,
the
court
obviously
could
compel
disclosure
of
the
guidelines
and
if
the
guidelines
were
not
on
principle
then
there
might
be
a
basis.
the
fbi,
for
example,
has
all
kinds
of
rules
that
they
don't
necessarily
disclose
to
the
public.
our
point
is,
it
is
important
not
to
conflate
the
issue
of
fair
notice
and
standards
for
enforcement.
when
people
are
told
to
move
on,
they
are
given
notice
of
what
the
law
requires
them
to
do.
that--
mr.
lawrence
rosenthal
--we
know
of
no
principle
of
constitutional
law--
mr.
lawrence
rosenthal
--the
city...
we
start
with
the
ordinance.
the
city
council
passed
an
ordinance,
it's
public
record
which
grants
to
the
police
the
authority
under
these
specified
circumstances
when
a
member
of
a
criminal
street
gang
is
present,
to
issue
the
order.
the
public,
of
course,
has
notice
of
the
authority
that
is
conferred
on
the
police.
mr.
lawrence
rosenthal
under
the
ordinance,
people
are
only
told
to
disperse,
and
again,
we
know
of
no
principle
of
constitutional
law
that
entitles
one
to
be
given
a
reason.
if
the
police
are
clearing
the
street
in
washington
because
the
president
is
about
to
walk
by,
we
know
of
no
rule
that
says
they
have
to
explain
to
people
the
reason
you
need
to
move
is
that
the
president
is
coming.
mr.
lawrence
rosenthal
well,
justice
souter,
as
the
illinois
supreme
court
acknowledged,
as
a
matter
of
ordinance
construction,
the
term
loiter
has
a
common
and
accepted
meaning.
that
court
embraced
dictionary
definitions
of
the
term
loiter,
and
it
acknowledged--
mr.
lawrence
rosenthal
--that
is
the
definition
of
the
term,
loiter.
in
addition--
mr.
lawrence
rosenthal
--well,
the
ordinance...
what
is
critical
under
the
ordinance
is
if
an
individual's
purpose
for
remaining
in
any
one
place
is
apparent.
if
the
officer
cannot
tell--
mr.
lawrence
rosenthal
--if
the
person's
purpose
for
remaining
in
any
one
place
is
apparent,
if
the
officer
does
not
know
if
the
reason
the
individual
is
standing
still,
the
group
are
standing
still,
is
they're
enjoying
the
night
air,
or
they're
going
to
resume
dealing
drugs
from
their
specified
location
as
soon
as
the
officer
leaves,
the
purpose
for
remaining
still,
for
standing
still
is
not
purpose,
is
not
apparent.
but
justice
souter,
i
think
what's
even
more
critical
is,
is
to
consider
the
premise
whether
people
are
doing
anything
wrong
when
they're
loitering
under
this
ordinance.
one
of
the
premises
for
this
regulation
is
that
the
nongang
member
is
at
risk
when
he
is
standing
still
at
public.
when
people
know
they're
with
gang
members,
at
least
you
can
say
that
they're
assuming
the
risks
that
adhere
in
standing
still
with
someone
who
is--
mr.
lawrence
rosenthal
--well--
mr.
lawrence
rosenthal
--justice
o'connor--
mr.
lawrence
rosenthal
--justice
o'connor--
mr.
lawrence
rosenthal
--justice
o'connor,
illinois
has
an
intimidation
statute.
one
should
not
underestimate,
however,
the
difficulty
of
enforcing
laws
when
a
neighborhood
is
so
terrorized
by
gang
crime
they
are
afraid.
the
only
way
to
bring
an
intimidation
case
when
the
police
are
not
present
is
to
put
oneself
in
harm's
way
by
offering
to
be
a
witness.
the
great
virtue
of
this
ordinance
is
that
people
call
the
police
and,
instead
of
being
told,
sorry,
unless
you're
willing
to
testify
there's
nothing
i
can
do
for
you,
they
see
visible
results.
the
loiterers
are
dispersed,
and
not
only
does
that
inhibit
crime
and
violence,
but
it
also
energizes
the
community
in
a
host
of
ways
when
they
see
a
visible
pay
off
for
cooperating
with
the
police
in
a
host
of--
mr.
lawrence
rosenthal
--well,
and
i
don't--
mr.
lawrence
rosenthal
--well,
and
on
the
question
of
vagueness,
i
don't
mean
to
say
the
end
justifies
the
means.
what
i
do
mean
to
say
is,
even
putting
loitering
aside,
there
is
one
unquestionably
objective
standard
for
enforcement.
first,
people
need
to
be
standing
still.
no
question
that's
objective.
even
if
one
doesn't
know
what
loitering
is,
enforcement
is
delimited
to
people
who
aren't
walking.
second,
enforcement
is
limited
when
there
is
a
reasonable
belief
that
a
member
of
a
criminal
street
gang
is
present,
and
always
there,
even
if
another
individual
doesn't
realize
he's
next
to
a
gang
member.
mr.
lawrence
rosenthal
that's
correct.
there
is--
mr.
lawrence
rosenthal
--we
do...
we
find
nothing
in
the
constitution
that
protects
the
right
to
loiter.
mr.
lawrence
rosenthal
we
see
no
constitutional
protection
in
the
right
to
loiter.
mr.
lawrence
rosenthal
and
absolutely
no
right
to
join
a
criminal
street
gang
under
our
constitution
and
not
to
stand
next
to
a
criminal
street
gang
with
no...
with
or
without
an
apparent
purpose.
kolender,
the--
mr.
lawrence
rosenthal
--well,
and
of
course
papachristou
was
a
drag
net.
there
was
no
order
to
disperse
given,
and
anyone
outdoors
at
night
could
be
arrested.
mr.
lawrence
rosenthal
what
i
think
is
so
interesting
about
justice
o'connor's
opinion
in
kolender
is,
loitering
was
an
element
of
that
offense.
not
a
single
member
of
the
court
identified
any
problem
with
using
loitering
as
a
member
of
the
offense.
justice
brennan
even
wrote
separately,
because
he
thought
there
was
an
additional
constitutional
infirmity.
mr.
lawrence
rosenthal
yes.
that's
correct,
and--
mr.
lawrence
rosenthal
--i
quite
agree
there
must
be
minimal
guidelines,
although
kolender
hypothesized
a
law
with
loitering
as
an
element
that
would
be
constitutional
and
didn't
identify
loitering
as
the
invalid
element
in
that
statute.
but
here,
even
if
loitering
alone
would
be
fatally
imprecise,
enforcement
is
delimited
only
to
a
particular
class
of
potentially
dangerous
people
when
a
member
of
a
criminal
street
gang
is
present.
that
is
a
limit
on
enforcement
discretion,
limits
enforcement
only
when
the
potential
danger
identified
by
the
legislature
is
present.
no
question
this
law
is,
like
most
prophylactic
laws,
tough.
it
will
occasionally
be
applied
to
individuals
who
in
fact...
whose
hearts
are
in
fact
pure.
that
does
not
create
a
problem
of
vagueness,
however.
people
are
told
precisely
what
they
must
do,
and
there
are
standards
for
who
can
receive
the
order.
the
problem
that
creates,
like
any
prophylactic
law,
is
at
most
a
problem
of
substantive
due
process,
and
it
is
to
that
question
that
i
will
now
turn.
on
the
question--
mr.
lawrence
rosenthal
--well,
the
officer
is
in
many
ways
like
a
camera.
when
he
goes
to
court
and
testifies
to
support
his
order,
all
he
does
is
describe
what
he
saw.
if
the
judge
saw
a
picture
and
could
tell
why
people
are
remaining
in
one
place...
they're
playing
basketball
on
a
court,
they're
looking
at
christmas
windows
at
a
department
store...
there
is
an
objective
basis.
mr.
lawrence
rosenthal
well,
but
in--
mr.
lawrence
rosenthal
--well,
justice
souter
in
these--
mr.
lawrence
rosenthal
--it
would
not,
justice
souter,
and
the
reason
is
in
these
neighborhoods
police
can't
tell
if
one's
standing
still
to
watch
the
cars
go
by
or
because
that's
where
you
deal
drugs
as
soon
as
the
police
leave,
but
if
you
are
so--
mr.
lawrence
rosenthal
--with...
there
is
a
judgment,
but
i
think
it
is
actually
the
reverse.
when
the
police
officer
cannot
tell,
that's
when
he
can't
make
a
judgment.
the
ordinance
is
rigid
in
that
respect.
but
assume
with
me,
justice
souter,
loitering
alone
would
be
fatally
imprecise.
nevertheless,
a
law
that
says,
one
cannot
stand
still
in
the
city
of
chicago
when
ordered
to
move
on
by
a
police
officer,
is
not
vague.
whatever
else
it
is,
it
is
not
vague.
the
most
you
can
say--
mr.
lawrence
rosenthal
--well,
because
the
law
does
require
minimal
standards,
and
even
if
apparent
purpose
alone
is
not
enough,
kolender
does
not
say
every
loitering
law
in
the
country
is
unconstitutional.
if
there
are
other
criteria--
mr.
lawrence
rosenthal
--well,
that
is
what
this
court
said
in
the
kolender
case.
mr.
lawrence
rosenthal
no.
that
part
of
the
kolender
opinion,
justice
scalia,
addressed
the
danger
of
arbitrary
and
discriminatory
enforcement.
justice
o'connor
did
not
have
a
problem,
and
the
court
did
not
identify
a
problem
in
that
opinion
with
fair
notice.
there
was
plenty
of
notice
in
kolender.
it
was
the
second
prong
of
the
due
process
inquiry
that
the
court
centered
on
in
kolender.
mr.
lawrence
rosenthal
it
is,
and
that
simply
shows--
mr.
lawrence
rosenthal
--that...
and
that
shows
that
there
are
hypotheticals
where
this
ordinance
can...
there's
certainly
a
standard,
but
it
nevertheless
can
be
applied.
what
is
critical,
though,
it's
so
interesting
that
after
tens
of
thousands
of
applications
respondents
can't
identify
a
single
case
where
that
actually
happened,
and
the
legislative
findings
explain
why.
in
these
communities,
law
abiding
people
are
afraid
to
use
their
public
spaces.
people
are
afraid
to
stand
with
gang
members
because
gang
members
do
not
want
law
abiding
people
in
their
midst.
the
legislature
could
rationally
conclude
that
since
the
burden
under
this
ordinance
is
so
minimal,
usually
just
a
minor
inconvenience,
moving
on,
and
these
hypotheticals
are
so
unlikely
to
occur,
that
the
benefits
of
creating
this
prophylactic
law
to
deal
with
enormous
evils
associated
with
gang
loitering
make
this
ordinance
amply
rational
and
hence
constitutional.
mr.
lawrence
rosenthal
as
the
amicus
briefs
describe,
i
think
there
are
a
great
variety
of
loitering
laws.
some
are
much
more
general.
loitering
with
intent,
for
example,
was
quite...
the
model
penal
code
recommends
a
loitering
law
that
is
entirely
general.
some
are
specific.
would
the
chief
justice--
mr.
lawrence
rosenthal
--and
the
general
order
here
does
provide
that
the
ordinance
will
only
be
enforced
where
a
district
commander
has
determined
that
gang
loitering
has
a
demonstrable
effect
on
the
activities
of
law--
mr.
lawrence
rosenthal
--well,
the
general
order
is
public.
it
is
also
in
the
record,
and
this
court
has
over
and
over
again
said,
from
hoffman
estates
on,
facial
attacks
should
be
considered
in
light
of
these
kind
of
administrative
practices.
mr.
lawrence
rosenthal
that's
correct.
the
general
order,
the
standard
for
designation
is
in
the
record,
in
the
general
order.
the
general
order
itself
is
public.
which
areas
are
designated,
that
was
not
made
public.
mr.
lawrence
rosenthal
we
are,
one
that--
mr.
lawrence
rosenthal
--we
are.
it's
a
facial--
mr.
lawrence
rosenthal
--i
think
not.
all
the
court
requires
is
fair
notice
of
what
to
do
in
order
to
conform
one's
conduct
in
the
law.
here,
the
order
to
disperse
gives
fair
notice
in
terms
of--
mr.
lawrence
rosenthal
--well,
they
can
stand
there
until
a
police
order
is
given,
when--
mr.
lawrence
rosenthal
--and
under
those
circumstances
the
legislature
could
rationally
conclude
that
hypothetical
is
unlikely,
because
they
heard
from
the
citizens,
who
are
scared
to
use
the
public--
mr.
lawrence
rosenthal
--there
is
certainly
ample
testimony
that
law
abiding
people
are
afraid
to
stand
with
gang
members,
who
are
going
to
be
dealing
drugs
and
don't--
mr.
lawrence
rosenthal
--certainly,
nothing
vague
about
that
law--
mr.
lawrence
rosenthal
--if
rational,
given
the
legislative
record,
and
here,
we
of
course
confine
our
argument
to
the
evidence
and
the
findings
of
the
city
council.
we
do
think
that
would
be
rational.
i'd
like
to
reserve--
mr.
lawrence
rosenthal
--in
our
view,
rational
basis,
we
find
no
fundamental
constitutional
right
to
stand
still.
mr.
lawrence
rosenthal
i...
sure,
i've
met
such--
mr.
lawrence
rosenthal
--and
of
course,
one
can
walk
wherever
one
wants,
and
one
can
stand
alone
whenever
one
wants.
i
would
like,
mr.
chief
justice,
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
lawrence
rosenthal
the
kind
of
terror
to
the
point
where
law
abiding
people
won't
even
be
able
to
use
their
streets
and
are
at
risk
of
drive
by
shootings
and
other
things
where
they're
near
gang
members,
that
kind
of
terror
doesn't
exist,
i
think,
justice
ginsburg,
in
your
hypotheticals.
i
doubt
that
ordinance
would
be
rational,
and
i
doubt
that
anyone...
any
legislature
would
pass
that
ordinance.
mr.
lawrence
rosenthal
united
states
attorney's
office
for
the
northern
district
of
illinois
estimates
there
are
100,000
gang
members
in
the
city
of
chicago.
mr.
grossman
says
we
must
use
laws
that
require
individualized
determinations.
well,
it
was
the
failure
of
those
laws
to
satisfactorily
address
the
problem
that
led
to
the
enactment
of
this
ordinance
and,
indeed,
gang
crime
has
been
rising
since
the
ordinance
was
no
longer
in
effect
in
'97.
more
people
got
shot
as
a
result
of
gang
related
shootings.
the
fatality
rate
went
down.
more
people
have
gotten
shot
again
this
year.
in
fact,
drive
bys
are
up
40
percent
this
year
in
the
city
of
chicago
without
this
ordinance.
what
does
that
tell
us?
well,
on
the
vagueness
prong...
there
are
two
prongs,
of
course,
to
vagueness
inquiry.
fair
notice.
mr.
grossman
doesn't
really
address
that,
because
no
criminal
sanctions
are
available
under
this
ordinance
for
loitering
alone.
criminal
sanctions
come
into
play
only
after
an
officer
specifically
informs
an
individual
that
he
has
loitered
in
that
officer's...
the
officer's
determined
he's
loitered
with
a
gang
member
in
a
public
place
and
is
subject
to
an
order
to
disperse.
mr.
grossman
therefore
focuses
on
the
second
prong.
the
second
prong
the
court
describes
as
minimal
standards.
there
is
not
some
manual
for
how
to
write
statutes
lurking
in
the
due
process
clause
and
here,
whatever
the
imprecisions
in
loitering,
even
if
this
ordinance
can
be
potentially
applied
to
all
people
standing
still,
remaining
in
any
one
place,
in
the
city
of
chicago
there
remains
an
enforcement
standard.
there
must
be
a
reasonable
belief
that
a
member
of
a
criminal
street
gang
is
present
and
that
has
dangers
associated
with
it,
as
the
legislature
found,
not
only
dangers
to
the
gang
member,
dangers
to
the
innocent
bystanders
that
are
nearby.
when
innocent
bystanders
are
ordered
to
move
on,
it
is
not
because
they've
done
anything
wrong.
it
is
to
protect
them
from
the
dangers
of
drive
by
shooting,
as
well
as
the
dangers
of
gang
recruitment,
and
of
the--
mr.
lawrence
rosenthal
--by
ordering
everyone
to
move
on,
it
is
far
simpler,
rather
than
sorting
through
a
crowd
and
telling
each
individual
who
must
stay
and
who...
who
may
stay
and
who
must
go.
it
is
far
more
effective
to
issue
these
dispersal
orders
generally
and,
of
course
narrow
tailoring
is
not
required
in
rational
basis
analysis
under
the
substantive
due
process
clause.
the
efficacy
of
the
order
to
move
on
is
greater
if
the
police
do
not
have
to,
while
they
are
on
there,
in
a
potentially
dangerous
situation,
trying
to
sort
through
a
crowd
and
make
again
what
mr.
grossman
calls
individualized
determination.
mr.
lawrence
rosenthal
absolutely,
justice
scalia.
mr.
lawrence
rosenthal
justice
scalia,
it
is
so
interesting
that
the
respondents
have
chosen
to
dwell
in
the
realm
of
hypotheticals
on
a
facial
challenge,
after
there
were
tens
of
thousands
of
applications
of
this
ordinance.
the
legislative
findings
do
tell
us
that
law
abiding
people
are
afraid
to
use
these
public
spaces,
and
that's
what
makes
the
legislative
judgment
here
rational,
that
these
hypothetical
law
abiding
people
get
sweeped
up.
at
most,
it
is
a
minimal
inconvenience.
maybe--
mr.
lawrence
rosenthal
--the
police
did
not
have...
were
not
able
to
establish
a
reasonable
belief
that
they
were
gang
members.
nevertheless,
those
individuals
are
at
risk
of
being
recruited
into
the
gang,
are
at
risk
of
drive
by
shootings...
there
are
a
variety
of
reasons
why
the
legislature
can
discourage
this
association.
the
constitution
does
not
protect
the
right
to
stand
next
to
a
gang
member.
that
is
not
a
protected
form
of
associational
activity.
here,
the
legislative
findings
amply
explain
why
the
legislature
could
reasonably
conclude...
at
most,
people
will
have
to
stand
on
private
property,
on
somebody's
lawn,
since
the
ordinance
is
limited
to
public
places.
that
modest
inconvenience,
if
you
will,
by
having
to
obey
the
order,
is
amply
justified
by...
taking...
in...
when
the
legislature
instead
is
able
to
create
a
law
that
does
not
depend
on
individualized
determinations,
that
will
in
turn
depend
on
civilian
witnesses,
since
the
police
cannot
be
everywhere--
mr.
lawrence
rosenthal
--and
for
that
reason,
we
ask
that
judgment
be
reversed.
thank
you.
