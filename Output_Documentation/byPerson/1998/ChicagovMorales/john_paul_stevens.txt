justice
john
paul
stevens
i
suppose
the
city's
answer
to
that
is
that
it's
unenforceable
because
we
have
to
have
a
nongang
member
neighborhood
resident
testify,
and
they
won't
testify,
and
the
police
come
by
and
the
police
see
nothing.
i
assume
that's
their
answer.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
if...
you
suggested
earlier
that
it
would
be
the
same
problem
if
there
were...
nongang
members
were
not
included
in
the
ordinance.
would
it
change
your
view
of
the
case
if
the
number
of
persons
that
had
to
congregate
were
increased
to
say,
10...
what
if
the
ordinance
said,
if
the
police
find
10
or
more
people
whom
they
have
probable
cause
to
believe
are
gang
members,
they
can
order
them
to
disperse--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--if
they
loiter
without
apparent
purpose.
justice
john
paul
stevens
would
that
be
valid?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
i'm
assuming
that
the...
you
still
have
the
same
loitering
condition,
and
the
same
definition
of
loitering,
no
apparent
purpose,
but
you're...
you
have
two
major
changes.
you
take
out
the
nongang
members,
and
you
increase
the
number
of
gang
members,
so
if
there
are,
say,
five
or
more
gang
members
loitering
in
an
area,
they
can
be
ordered
to
disperse
by
the
officer,
and
if
they
don't
obey,
it
would
be
a
violation
of
the
ordinance.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
what
would
be
the
defect,
the
principal
defect
in
that
ordinance?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
grossman,
could
i
ask
you
a
question
about
a
fact
of
life?
the
amicus
briefs
are
a
little
confusing
to
me
in
describing
the
extent
to
which
the...
this
ordinance
was
supported
by
the
african
american
aldermen
in
chicago.
do
you
know
what
the
answer
is
to
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
second
case
that
i
have
to
announce
is
chicago
against
morales
and
it
comes
to
us
from
the
supreme
court
of
illinois.
in
1992,
the
chicago
city
council
enacted
a
gang
congregation
ordinance.
the
ordinance
contains
a
series
of
findings
that
explain
the
reasons
for
its
enactment.
the
council
has
found
that
a
continuing
increase
in
criminal
street
gang
activity
was
largely
responsible
for
the
city's
rising
murder
rate,
as
well
as,
an
escalation
of
violent
and
drug
related
crimes.
it
noted
that
in
many
neighborhoods
through
out
the
city,
"the
burgeoning
presence
of
street
gang
members
in
public
places
has
intimidated
many
law
abiding
citizens".
furthermore,
the
council
stated,
the
gang
members
establish
control
over
identifiable
areas
by
loitering
in
those
areas
and
intimidating
others
from
entering
those
areas.
members
of
criminal
streets
gang
avoid
arrest
by
committing
no
offence
punishable
under
existing
laws
when
they
know
the
police
are
present.
it
further
found
that
loitering
in
public
places
like
criminal
street
gang
members
creates
a
justifiable
fear
for
the
safety
of
persons
and
property
in
the
area
and
aggressive
action
is
necessary
to
preserve
the
city
streets
and
public
places
so
that
the
public
may
use
such
places
without
fear.
the
text
of
the
ordinance
covers
a
great
deal
of
conduct
that
is
not
described
in
those
findings.
under
the
ordinance
"if
a
police
officers
observes
a
person
whom
he
reasonably
believes
could
be
a
gang
member,
loitering
in
a
public
place
with
one
or
more
other
people,
the
officer
shall
order
the
group
to
disperse,
any
person
who
does
not
obey
the
dispersal
order
has
violated
the
ordinance."
the
ordinance
defines
the
term
loitering,
"as
to
remain
in
one
place
with
no
apparent
purpose".
it
creates
a
criminal
offence
punishable
by
a
fine
of
up
to
$500,
imprisonment
for
not
more
than
six
months
and
requirement
to
perform
up
to
120
hours
of
community
service.
in
the
three
years
after
the
enactment
of
the
ordinance,
the
chicago
police
issued
approximately
89,000
dispersal
orders
and
arrested
over
42,000
people.
they
acted
pursuant
to
a
police
department
general
order
that
limited
the
areas
of
the
city
in
which
the
ordinance
would
apply,
but
the
police
did
not
release
this
information
to
the
public.
a
number
of
chicago
citizens
who
were
arrested
under
the
ordinance
contended
that
the
law
violated
the
federal
and
illinois
constitutions.
two
state
trial
judges
rejected
this
contention
and
upheld
the
ordinance.
11
others
how
ever
held
the
law
unconstitutional,
several
appeals
were
consolidated
in
the
illinois
appellate
court
and
that
court
also
found
the
ordinance
unconstitutional.
it
held
that
the
ordinance
violated
the
freedom
of
assembly
guaranteed
by
the
first
amendment
of
the
federal
constitution,
that
it
was
unconstitutionally
vague
that
a
criminal
like
status
rather
than
conduct
and
it
jeopardized
the
rights
protected
by
the
forth
amendment.
the
illinois
supreme
court
unanimously
affirmed,
finding
the
ordinance
unconstitutionally
vague
in
violation
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
of
the
federal
constitution.
we
granted
certiorari
and
now
affirm.
we
agree
with
the
illinois
supreme
court
that
the
ordinance
is
unconstitutionally
vague
because
it
allows
and
perhaps
encourages
the
police
to
enforce
it
in
an
arbitrary
and
discriminatory
way.
the
ordinance
defines
loitering
as
having
"no
apparent
purpose".
the
illinois
supreme
court
concluded
that
this
definition
provides
absolute
discretion
to
police
officers
to
determine
what
activities
constitute
loitering.
we
accept
their
construction
of
this
phrase
and
we
agree
that
it
gives
police
officers
too
much
discretion
in
determining
whom
they
should
order
to
disperse.
all
parties
agree
that
a
person's
actual
purpose
in
standing
in
a
public
place
is
irrelevant
under
the
ordinance.
it
does
not
matter,
for
example,
whether
the
reason
that
a
gang
member
and
his
father
might
loiter
near
wrigley
field
is
to
rob
an
unsuspecting
fan
or
just
to
get
a
glimpse
of
sammy
sosa
leaving
the
ballpark.
if
their
purpose
is
not
apparent
to
a
near
by
police
officer,
the
officer
has
the
authority
to
order
them
to
disperse,
unless
of
course
the
police
department
has
decided
not
to
enforce
the
ordinance
in
that
part
of
the
city.
any
chicagoan
who
stands
on
a
public
street
with
a
gang
member,
for
any
reason,
runs
the
risk
that
a
police
officer
may
not
believe
she
has
an
apparent
purpose,
even
if
she
is
standing
with
her
son
in
front
of
their
apartment
building.
in
addition,
to
my
opinion
supporting
the
averments,
opinions
supporting
the
judgment
have
been,
authored
by
justice
o'connor,
justice
kennedy
and
justice
breyer.
justice
thomas,
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
the
chief
justice
joins
and
justice
scalia
has
also
filed
a
dissent.
