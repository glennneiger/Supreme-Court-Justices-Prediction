mr.
harvey
grossman
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court--
the
city
of
chicago
has
enacted
a
statute
which
is
inherently
vague
and
overbroad.
at
its
core,
it
defines
no
conduct
that--
mr.
harvey
grossman
--it
did
not,
your
honor,
but
we
have
preserved
that
issue.
the
illinois
appellate
court
did
rule
that
the
statute...
the
ordinance
was
overbroad.
mr.
harvey
grossman
yes,
we
have,
your
honor.
this
law
requires
a
police
officer
to
engage
in
a
surreal
exercise
of
seeking
to
determine
whether
or
not
someone
has
a
purpose
that
qualifies
for
exclusion
or
exclusion
under
this
vaguely
worded
law.
nothing
has
changed
linguistically
in
our
culture
over
the
last
100
years.
at
the
turn
of
the
century
the
supreme
court
of
missouri
struck
down
the
first
loitering
law
that
a
court
held
unconstitutional
in
this
country,
and
the
progression
has
been
continuous.
there
is
no
debate
about
the
issue
amongst
a
overwhelming
majority
of
modern
courts.
mr.
harvey
grossman
whether
a
police
officer
will
have
sufficient
guidance
under
a
law
that
prohibits
nothing
more
than
mere
loitering,
in
this
case
defined
as
having
no
apparent
purpose,
when
that
officer
seeks
to
apply
it
in
the
field.
there
is
a
surreal
construct.
most
of
the
time
we
ask
police
officers
to
gauge
behavior
within
a
construct
of
wrongful
purpose
or
wrongful
behavior.
in
fact,
although
mr.
rosenthal
suggested
that
kolender
was
a
case
in
which
this
court
was
only
upset
about
the
question
of
arbitrary
enforcement,
in
fact
loitering
there
had
been
construed
by
the
california
court
to
require
reasonable
suspicion
of
commission
of
another
crime.
it
had
transposed
the
terry
standard
into
kolender,
so
when
this
court
looked--
mr.
harvey
grossman
--well--
mr.
harvey
grossman
--well--
mr.
harvey
grossman
--no,
i
think
that
it
matters
if
it
is
a
regul...
if
it
is
regulatory
in
nature.
i
think
that
there
is
a
safety
interest
in
regulatory
stops
to
check
license
or
check
sobriety,
and
that
this
court
has
limited
discretion,
and
what
kind
of
road
block--
mr.
harvey
grossman
--i
think
the
situs--
mr.
harvey
grossman
--if
i
could
go
on,
i
don't
think--
mr.
harvey
grossman
--no.
it
is
a
different
kind
of
interest.
one
has
to
look
at
what
the
person
is
doing
when
they're
exercising
their
right
of
free
movement.
in
this
instance
we're
talking
about
limiting,
indeed
banishing
from
the
public
place
people
who
are
involved
in
free
movement
on
the
most
basic
site
that
our
country
recognizes
as
a
place
for
both
the
presence
of
people,
their
streets
and
sidewalks.
mr.
harvey
grossman
your
honor,
i
respectfully
disagree.
the
issue
about
whether
or
not
move
on
cures,
a
move
on
order
cures
the
question
of
notice
i
think
is
a
high
level
of
sophistry
that
the
city
is
engaging
in.
what
this
court
is
dealing
with
is
not
a
dispersal
ordinance.
a
dispersal
ordinance
is
the
one
that
i
think
was
described
by
justice
souter.
this
is
a
ordinance
which
prohibits
loitering
and
association.
an
element
of
the
offense
here
is
loitering.
when
you
go
to
court,
you
are
not
charged
with
failing
to
disperse.
you
are
charged
first
with
loitering,
having
no
apparent
purpose
and,
in
fact,
when
the
city
argues
that
we
should
deal
with
this
on
an
as
applied
basis,
the
city
is--
mr.
harvey
grossman
--the
court
can
freely
examine
the
charging
documents
in
this
case
that
are
of
record.
that
is
not
the
nature
of
the
charge.
the
charge
is
that
you
were
loitering.
you
were
found
on
the
street
with
no
apparent
purpose
with
a
person
reasonably
suspected
of
being
a
gang
member,
and
that
you
failed
to
disperse,
and
that
is--
mr.
harvey
grossman
--well,
your
honor,
i
respectfully
disagree
with
you.
i
not
only
understand--
mr.
harvey
grossman
--i
disagree
with
how
you're
parsing
the
statute,
and
i
also
disagree
with
how
it
is
that
the
city
views
this
statute
in
reality,
because
whenever
the
city
talks
about
whether
or
not
this
ordinance
inappropriately
sweeps
within
its
prosecution
scope
persons
who
it
thinks
shouldn't
be
prosecuted
or
is
embarrassed
to
say
should
be
prosecuted,
or
fears
that
if
it
does
agree
that
they
would
be
subject
to
prosecution
that
it
would
violate
even
minimal
notions
of
rationality,
it
says
they
are
free
to
go
to
court
and
prove
they
weren't
loitering.
mr.
harvey
grossman
in
fact,
mr.
rosenthal
did
it
as
he
stood
up
here.
he
said,
they'll
tell
the
judge
they
were
window
shopping.
they'll
tell
the
judge--
mr.
harvey
grossman
--no,
it
is
not.
in
fact,
the
only
affirmative
defense
in
this
ordinance
is
that
you
weren't...
that
somebody
wasn't
a
gang
member.
the
burden
is
on
you
to
prove
that
the
person
that
you
were
standing
with
was
not
a
gang
member,
an
impossible
burden.
mr.
harvey
grossman
absolutely.
mr.
harvey
grossman
and
the
charging
documents
do
do
that.
mr.
harvey
grossman
absolutely.
mr.
harvey
grossman
they
do,
and
they
make
a
distinction.
34
of
the
defen...
34
of
the
66
defendants
here
were
charged
in
a
document
that
only
accused
them
of
being
in
the
presence
of
a
gang
member.
the
remaining
members
of
the
66
defendants
were
charged
with
being
gang
members,
and
i'd
like
to
stress
to
the
court
that
there
is
nothing
in
the
evidentiary
record
before
the
city
council
that
speaks
to
nongang
members,
nothing
whatsoever.
mr.
harvey
grossman
there
is
no
one--
mr.
harvey
grossman
--there
is
no
one
of
the
66
defendants
who
has
a
charging
document
that
does
not
recite
verbatim--
mr.
harvey
grossman
--yes--
mr.
harvey
grossman
--your
honor,
i
am
answering
your
question
within
my
capability.
i
cannot
speak
to
anyone
other
than
the
66
defendants.
90,000
people
have
been
swept
up
by
this
ordinance.
mr.
harvey
grossman
mr.
morales
testifies...
excuse
me,
your
honor.
i
do
not
mean
to
be
evasive.
mr.
morales
testifies
that
he
was
not
ordered
to
disperse.
that
is
the
only...
there
are
only
6
of
the
66--
mr.
harvey
grossman
--he
was
charged
that
way,
yes,
sir.
mr.
harvey
grossman
all
66
of
the
defendants
before
the
court
have
been
so
charged.
mr.
harvey
grossman
i
do
not,
your
honor.
mr.
harvey
grossman
i'd
like
to
reiterate
that
there
is
nothing
in
this
record,
the
evidentiary
record
before
the
city
council,
that
spoke
to
nongang
members
at
all.
the
city
can't
have
it
both
ways.
in
one
breath
they
stand
before
this
court
and
they
say
that
the
streets
are
so
dangerous,
that
these
gang
members
are
so
threatening,
that
no
one
stands
around
them,
and
then
in
the
next
minute
they
try
to
justify
an
ordinance
that
broadly
and
without
an
evidentiary
basis,
certainly
no
substantial--
mr.
harvey
grossman
--i
think
that
the
illinois
supreme
court,
as
many
other
courts...
in
fact,
we
cite
people
v.
caswell,
which
is
a
california
supreme
court,
which
reviews
in
some
detail
the
way
that
the
states
have
treated
this
matter.
they
all,
as
illinois...
the
illinois
supreme
court
stated,
have
dealt
with
the
issue
of
whether
a
loitering
type
ordinance
can
be
made
constitutional
by
adding
a
scienter
requirement.
this
court
has
recognized
that
as
both
assisting
and
providing
notice
and
also
in
helping
to
limit
discretion
of
police
officers
to
put
a
construct
of
wrongful
purpose
or
behavior
on
a
police
officer
and
on
the
citizen.
they
make
a
distinction
between
innocent
loitering
and
criminal
loitering.
i
think
that
if
we
give
people
that
kind
of
notice,
it
will
look
different.
the
person
who's
window
shopping
doesn't
look
like
a...
doesn't
loiter
the
way
that
a
person--
mr.
harvey
grossman
--well,
but
the
other
states
have
been
living
with
intent
to...
loitering
with
intent
to
deal
drugs,
loitering
with
intent
to
engage
in
prostitution,
and
there
are--
mr.
harvey
grossman
--massive
numbers
of
prosecutions
under
those
laws.
you
can
read
the
appellate
decisions
affirming
that.
what
it
looks
like
when
you
watch
somebody
is
that
they
aren't
looking
in
a
window.
they're
moving
furtively
across,
they're
talking
to
people
in
cars,
they're
engaging
in
the
kind
of
behavior
that's
probative
of
wrongful
conduct,
and
that's
something
that
a
police
officer
can
do.
a
police
officer
can,
within
those
boundaries,
make
appropriate
judgments.
we
ask
them
to
do
that
all
day
long
when
we
ask
them
to--
mr.
harvey
grossman
--no,
i
think
that
people
have
to...
i
think
that
there
are
different...
well,
first
of
all
they
do
do
that.
mr.
harvey
grossman
well,
they
do--
mr.
harvey
grossman
--well,
they
do
in
some
places
and
they
don't
in
some
places.
in
the
places
that
are
hot,
on
corners
where
there's
open
air
drug
market,
policemen
should
and
do
do
surveillance.
they
don't
drive
up
in
a
police
car.
they
do
surveillance
and
they
identify
people
and
they
make
arrests,
every
single
day
in
the
city
of
chicago,
of
people
who
are
engaged
in
selling
drugs
on
the
street.
mr.
harvey
grossman
they
have
a
right
to
try
to
stop
that
activity
through
various
means,
not
necessarily
a
broadly
worded
loitering
ordinance
that
includes
within
its
sweep
nongang
members.
mr.
harvey
grossman
apparent
purpose,
no
apparent
purpose
is
still
too
vague
for
a
police
officer
to
operate
under.
the
only
thing
that
you're
doing
is
taking
the
same
law
that
people
for
100
years
have
recognized
as
being
too
vague
to
provide
notice
and
saying
that
we're
going
to
impose
that
on
a
subset
of
the
population,
and
i'd
like
to
stress
that
this
ordinance--
mr.
harvey
grossman
--excuse
me?
mr.
harvey
grossman
no,
it...
i
think
that
those
are
both
vices
of
this
ordinance.
i
don't
think
that
they're
mutually
exclusive,
and
i
wouldn't
accept
the
ordinance
if
no
apparent
purpose
was
the
standard.
i
think
that
there
are
limits
with
what
we
can
do
in
trying
to
balance
what
is
the
right
of
people
to
move
on
the
street
and
to
communicate
on
the
street.
i
want
to
stress
that
there
are
people
who
are
nongang
members
who
associate
with
persons
who
are
reasonably
suspected
of
being
gang
members
on
the
street,
that
those
people
are
involved
in
all
sorts
of
forms
of
communication
and
protected
activity,
that
all
of
the
neighborhoods
don't
look
the
same,
that
places,
in
some
places
it
is
very
hot
on
a
corner
and
a
very
dangerous
place
to
be,
and
in
that
place
you'll
find
no
nongang
members,
but
in
the
broad
remainder
of
the
community
you
will
find
interaction,
because
suspected
gang
members--
mr.
harvey
grossman
--well,
first
of
all--
mr.
harvey
grossman
--i
am--
mr.
harvey
grossman
--i
am,
your
honor.
i
am
bound
by
this
ordinance.
this
ordinance
on
its
face
is
not
limited
to
any
particular
place.
the
police
department
has
created
general
orders
which
this
court
should
look
at,
in
which
it
says
it
will
designate
them,
but
it
is
not
limited
in
the
number
that
it
can
designate.
of
the
66
defendants
before
this
court,
they
were
arrested
in
28
different
locations.
90,000
people
have
been
swept
from
the
streets
of
the
city
of
chicago.
there
are
thousands
and
thousands
and
thousands
of
areas
that
have
been
designated,
street
corners,
city
blocks,
parks...
there
is
no
limitation
to
what
the
city
can
designate.
the
discretion
of
the
police
to
designate
those
areas
are
unreviewable.
this
isn't
for
example,
a
tightly
worded
injunction
like
the
acuna
case
out
of
california.
it
doesn't
bound
a
significant...
a
small
area
that's
been
shown
to
a
court
under
a
discrete
evidentiary
record
to
impact
in
the
way
that
we're
discussing.
mr.
harvey
grossman
it
does--
mr.
harvey
grossman
--thousands
and
thousands
have
been
designated.
mr.
harvey
grossman
if
there
are
thousands
and
thousands
of
hot
spots,
your
honor,
then
what
we're
talking
about
is
a
broad
omnibus
ordinance
that
stretches
across
the
entire
city,
and
we're
no
longer
talking
about
a
place,
an
ordinance
that's
focused,
and
limited,
and
applied
with
surgical
precision.
mr.
harvey
grossman
it
has
not
been
enforced
for
3
years
because
of
the
illinois
appellate
court
decision.
it
was
at
that
point
in
time,
december
of
'95,
that
the
city
chose
to
stop
enforcement
of
the
ordinance.
mr.
harvey
grossman
no,
although
the
city
continues
to
do
sweeps,
and
we
have
in
our
brief
before
the
court
indicated--
mr.
harvey
grossman
--i
think
that
they
continue
to
use
a
disorderly
conduct
ordinance
which
requires,
of
course,
a
threat
to...
an
imminent
breach
of
peace,
a
threat
to...
an
immediate
threat
to
the
public
safety,
and
that's
an
individualized
determination
that's
made
about
a
particular
person
on
the
street.
mr.
harvey
grossman
i
think
that--
mr.
harvey
grossman
--i
think--
mr.
harvey
grossman
--i
think
that
at
some
point
a
city
could
make
a
judgment
that
a
congregation
of
a
certain
size
posed
a
de
facto
obstruction
of
the
street,
for
example.
i
think
that
one
could
begin
to
approach
it
based
on
numbers.
i
think
that
one
could
begin
to
approach
it
on
the
basis
of
specific
locales.
loitering--
mr.
harvey
grossman
--i...
the
way
this
ordinance
is
phrased
is
suspected
gang
members.
i
suppose
that
if
you
tailored
it
more
closely
to
gang
members,
and
if
you
presented
a
construct
of
wrongful
purpose,
or
wrongful
behavior,
it
would
be
permissible.
mr.
harvey
grossman
no,
i
would
still
have
problems
with
the
vagueness
of
the
ordinance.
mr.
harvey
grossman
the
principal
defect
would
still
be
unbounded
discretion
of
a
police
officer,
because
he
has
to
make
the
judgment,
or
she
has
to
make
the
judgment
about
no
apparent
purpose.
but
this
court
did
do
something
in
boos
that
is
very
close
to
what
you're
talking
about,
your
honor.
you
approved
a
congregation
ordinance
in
boos
v.
berry
that
prohibited
congregations
near
an
embassy.
you
found
it
in
the
first
instance
problematic,
because
it
was
in
effect
phrased
in
the
manner
that
you're
describing.
it
simply
allowed
a...
once
there
was
a
congregation,
it
was
within
500
feet,
it
could
be
disbanded.
but
once
the
court
of
appeals
construed
it
as
being
a
congregation
which
posed
a
threat
to
safety,
at
that
point
in
time
it
required
an
individualized
determination
on
the
street,
and
if
that
kind
of
an
ordinance
were
phrased,
an
anticongregation
ordinance
that
complied
with
the
provisions
of
boos,
which
this
court
said
would
be
problematic
in
the
absence
of
those
qualifiers--
mr.
harvey
grossman
--the
boos...
the
boos
ordinance
did
not
speak
at
all
about
first
amendment
activity.
it
was
500
feet
away,
and
it
spoke
of
all
congregations.
mr.
harvey
grossman
well,
i
can't
agree
or
disagree
with
you
about
the
legislative
intent
on
that
particular
ordinance.
mr.
harvey
grossman
i
agree
that
the
court
considered
it
problematic
without
too
much
definition,
and
that
it
must
have
been
concerned
about
first
amendment
rights,
but
i
don't
think
that
first
amendment
rights
are
not
present
in
this
case.
the
city
itself
has
indicated
that
there
is
a
range
of
communications
which
it
will
permit
and
will
not
permit
under
this
ordinance.
it
will
allow
formal
demonstrations,
but
something
less
than
a
formal
demonstration,
people
talking
to
each
other,
it's
used...
it
has
offered
its
own
examples,
people
debating
the
constitutionality
of
the
ordinance,
people
engaged
in
common
discussion,
those
people
who
the
city
recognizes
are
involved
in
communicative
activities
the
city
says
will
be
swept
off
the
street
under
this
ordinance,
so
there--
mr.
harvey
grossman
--well,
your
honor,
this
is
a
regulation
of
the
public
street
and
in
kolender,
the
last
time
this
court
saw
a
pure
loitering
ordinance,
it
said
that
it
implicated
freedom
of
movement,
and
that
it
had
the
potential
to
arbitrarily
suppress
first
amendment
freedom.
the
same
is
true
of
shuttlesworth,
the
same
was
true
in
thornhill,
and
there
isn't
a
case
that
this
court
has
looked
at
in
the
last
60
years
which
deals
with
street
regulation
that
has
this
broad
a
scope
that
it
has
not
recognized
that
implicit
in
that
law
is
the
ability
to
sweep
from
the
street
people
involved
in
communicative
activity.
mr.
harvey
grossman
excuse
me?
mr.
harvey
grossman
because
when
you
are
attempting
to
regulate
the
street
there
are
a
multitude
of
interests
and
activities
which
the
citizen
possesses.
there
are
a
multitude
of
activities
in
which
that
person
can
engage
in.
and
so
when
this
court
has
approved
efforts
to
regulate
the
sidewalk,
and
notwithstanding
concerns
that
hanging
out
is
not
communicative
activity,
this
definition
of
no
apparent
purpose
embraces
and
includes
communicative
activity,
the
court
has
required
individualized
determinations
of
wrongdoing.
for
example,
in
grayned,
when
this
court
looked
at
an
antinoise
ordinance
in
close
proximity
to
a
school,
it
approved
it
as
opposed
to
a
general
breach
of
the
peace
statute
because
it
said
it
made
an
individualized...
it
required
an
individualized
determination
that
that
person
continuing
to
make
noise
presented
a
direct
threat
to
the
interest
the
city
sought
to
protect.
mr.
harvey
grossman
no,
i
think
that
it
is
not,
your
honor.
i
think
it's
still--
mr.
harvey
grossman
--because--
mr.
harvey
grossman
--we
have
always
allowed
people
to
continue
to
assemble
on
the
streets
in
public
fora
so
long
as
their
immediate
behavior
does
not
threaten
public
safety.
we
have
not,
for
example--
mr.
harvey
grossman
--there
is
not,
your
honor.
mr.
harvey
grossman
we
are.
we're
also
into
an
overbroad
ordinance
which
potentially
sweeps
within
it
protected
expression.
mr.
harvey
grossman
no,
i
do
not.
i
say--
mr.
harvey
grossman
--excuse
me,
your
honor.
i
did
not
mean
to
say
that,
if
that's
how
i
was
understood.
what
i
intended
to
say
is
that
we've
looked
at
ordinances...
for
example,
coates
talks
about
conduct...
assembly...
assembling
on
a
sidewalk
and
engaging
in
conduct
annoying
to
other
people.
i
mean,
clearly
that
can
be
any
kind
of
nonverbal,
noncommunicative
conduct.
mr.
harvey
grossman
well,
i
do
believe
that
that's
true,
and
that
you
can't
prophylactically
ban
that
activity
under
a
criminal
statute.
what
i
think
that
one
needs
to
do
is
to
try
to
break
down
the
interests
and
not
simply
say
that
they
are
substantive
due
process.
if
you
try
to
regulate
conduct
in
a
public
forum
on
the
streets,
on
the
sidewalks,
in
our
parks...
for
example,
the
city
has
identified
that
two
people
sitting
on
a
park
bench
are
subject
to
arrest
under
this
ordinance.
if
you
make
that
broad
and
that
sweeping
a
declaration
of
the
type
of
conduct
which
you
are
going
to
penalize...
dispersal
on
pain
of
arrest...
i
think
that
you
have
to
understand
that
you
will
sweep
within
it
not
simply
hanging
out,
but
a
multitude
of
human
activity
that
this
court
would
give
protection
to.
if
i
have
a
right
to
stand
on
the
street--
mr.
harvey
grossman
--yes.
i
do
believe...
and
i
don't
think
that
it's
low
grade
speech
necessarily.
like
it
or
not,
political
street...
street
gangs
in
the
city
of
chicago
engage
in
all
sorts
of
political
processes.
mr.
harvey
grossman
they
are
probably
doing
that.
there's
a
substantial
movement
on
the
west
side
of
chicago
right
now
challenging
police
behavior,
and
congressman
rush
has
it
as
a
major
agenda
item
on
his
run
in
the
mayoral
election
in
february,
and
i
have
no
question
that
members
of
street
gangs
are
active
in
that
dialogue,
and
that
they
have
a
right
to
engage
in
that
dialogue.
they
also
have
a
right
to
work
for
precinct
captains,
which
they
have
historically
done.
we
have
cited
spergel's
historic
work
on
gangs
in
our
brief
before
this
court.
you
will
find
that
quite
upright
aldermen
in
the
city
of
chicago
retain
street
gang
members
to
organize,
that
the
urban
league
in
the
city
of
chicago
has
given
a
subcontract
to
organizations
identified
as
having
substantial
gang
support
and
membership,
and
it
is
a
fact
of
life.
mr.
harvey
grossman
the
answer
to
that,
your
honor...
and
we
have
not
gotten
into
that
fray,
but
the
answer
to
that,
your
honor,
is
that
eight
african
american
aldermen
opposed
the
ordinance,
and
six
voted
in
favor.
mr.
harvey
grossman
i
would
agree
with
those
figures,
and
then
i
would
add
one
for
clarity,
and
that
is,
in
1997,
after
the
ordinance
was
no
longer
in
effect
for
2
years,
that
gang
related
homicides
dropped
19
percent
to
a
figure
of
183,
and
while
those
are
significant,
each
and
every
murder,
of
course,
is
significant,
that
in
1993,
when
this
whole
process
started,
there
were
223
gang
related
homicides
so
gang
related
homicides
have
decreased
over
the
last
5
years,
and
they
are
down
to
183
in
the
city.
