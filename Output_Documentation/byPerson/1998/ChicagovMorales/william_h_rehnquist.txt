rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
number
97-1121,
the
city
of
chicago
v.
jesus
morales.
mr.
rosenthal.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--to
what
extent
must
a
member
of
the
general
public
under
our
jurisprudence
know
precisely
what
a
criminal
statute
means?
i
mean,
take
the
screws
case.
do
you
think
that
the
people
who
have
been
prosecuted
under
that
statute
know
precisely
the
state
of
mind
that
is
required
by
the
court?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
rosenthal.
mr.
grossman,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
grossman,
the
question
of
overbreadth
isn't
before
us,
is
it?
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
didn't
rest
on
that
basis.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
you've
preserved
it
what,
as
an
alternate
ground
for
affirmance?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that's
not
a
question
of
vagueness.
there's
nothing
vague
about
being
told
by
a
police
officer
to
move
on.
perhaps
your
argument
is
really
overbreadth,
but
i
don't
think
you
should
call
it
vagueness.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
do
you
know
that?
i
mean,
certainly
i
would
not
read
the
ordinance
that
way.
i
would
think
that
the
charge
would
be
failing
to
obey
the
order
of
a
police
officer
to
move
on.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--that's
in
the
ordinance
as
an
affirmative
defense,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--he
asked
a
question,
mr.
grossman.
answer
the
question,
then
explain.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
grossman.
mr.
rosenthal,
you
have
4
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
rosenthal.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
case
is
submitted.
