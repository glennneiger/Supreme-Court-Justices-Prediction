justice
david
h.
souter
well,
maybe
they
should
and
maybe
not.
i
mean,
i
suppose
that
if
the
police
are
without
the
predicate
to
issue
the
order,
an
individual
is
within
his
rights
to
say
no,
i'm
not
going
to
move.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
regardless
of
whether
one
wants
to
test
it
or
not,
if
the
police
do
not
have
the
predicate
for
the
order
the
individual
doesn't
have
to
move.
justice
david
h.
souter
i
think
that
comes
back
to
the
point
we
keep
raising.
they
are
given
notice
of
the
fact
that
the
police
officer
has
concluded
that,
but
the
question
that
is
bothering
some
of
us
is,
on
what
basis
can
they
come
to
a
conclusion
that
they
have,
in
fact,
violated
the
ordinance.
justice
david
h.
souter
strike
that.
i've
misspoken.
on
what
basis
can
they
come
to
a
conclusion
that
the
police
officer
has
the
necessary
predicate
to
give
them
the
order?
that's
what's
bothering
us.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
i
can
accept
that,
but
it
seems
to
me
that's
not
the
problem.
the
problem
is
whether
the
individual
has
notice
of
the
standard
of
conduct
to
which
he
must
conform,
or
to
which
he
can
refer
when
he
decides
whether
the
police
officer
is
worthy
of
obedience
legally
in
making
the
order
that
he
makes,
and
that's...
that's...
you
know,
it
seems
that
was
behind
justice
kennedy's
question,
i
think
it's
behind
a
lot
of
our
questions.
gang...
identification
of
the
gang
member
is
one
thing.
identification
of
the
conduct
of
loitering,
so
defined,
is
another.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
the
meaning
here
involves
the
absence
of
an
apparent
purpose,
right?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
don't
most...
i
mean,
it...
i
have
difficulty
with
that,
because
it
seems
to
me
that
there
usually
is
an
apparent
purpose
for
most
of
what
we
call
loitering.
some
people,
for
example,
with
nothing
better
to
do
like
to
sit
and...
or
stand
and
watch
the
cars
go
by.
that's
a
purpose,
it
seems
to
me
that
under
this
ordinance,
the
problem
is
not
that
there
is
no
apparent
purpose
but
that
the
ordinance
necessarily
is
making
some
silent
assumptions
that
some
purposes
are
worthy
and
some
are
not,
and
it's
difficult,
i
would
think,
for
a
person,
particularly
for
a
non
gang
member,
to
stick
with
justice
kennedy's
first
question,
to
know
in
advance
what
purpose
is,
in
fact,
going
to
be
an
acceptable
one
under
the
ordinance
or
to
the
police.
justice
david
h.
souter
before
you
turn
to
it,
i'm
still
bothered
by
the
seemingly
open
ended
possibilities
of
determining
what
is...
what
is
or
is
not
an
apparent
purpose.
how
do
you
address
the
vagueness
of
that
and
the
discretion
of
the
officer
to
decide
whether
he
will
accept
the
appearance
of
a
purpose
or
not?
justice
david
h.
souter
they
want
to
watch
the
cars
go
by.
i
mean,
people...
there
are
communities
in
florida
in
which
people
apparently
spend
most
of
their
time
sitting
on
park
benches
watching
this.
their
purpose
is
perfectly
obvious.
justice
david
h.
souter
i
suppose
people
standing
on
a
street
corner
can
have
that
purpose.
there
is
an
apparent
purpose,
but
i
would
suppose
that
under
this
ordinance
it
would
not
be
accepted
as
an
apparent
purpose.
justice
david
h.
souter
would
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
they
can't
tell,
so
that
in
order
to
make
the
ordinance
work
they
have
to
make
a
judgment
about
what
they
will
accept
as
a
sufficient,
or
a
sufficiently
obvious
purpose,
or
a
sufficiently
legitimate
purpose.
i
mean,
they
do
have
to
make
that
judgment,
don't
they?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
that's
not
the
basis
upon
which
you're
basing
your
ordinance
here,
and
your
ordinance
is
based
upon
a
judgment,
and
it
seems
to
me
that
either
that
judgment
can
always
be
made...
i
mean,
you
know,
benjamin
franklin
said,
we
can
always
find
a
purpose
for
everything
that
is
done,
or
it's
a
judgment
which
is
left
entirely
to
the
discretion
of
the
officer
to
decide
on
a
normative
basis
whether
the
apparent
purpose
is,
in
fact,
a
legitimate
one,
and
i
don't
see
how
you
get
around
that
problem.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
mr.--
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
mr.
grossman,
wouldn't
you
take
the
position
if
you
were
defending
someone
that
the
complaint
certainly
should
charge
the
predicate
of
the
order,
that
is,
loitering
in
the
company
of
a
gang
member?
justice
david
h.
souter
all
right.
justice
david
h.
souter
that's
what
they
do,
so--
justice
david
h.
souter
--so
in
fact
they
charge
both
the
loitering,
the
identity
of
the
gang
member,
and
the
refusal
to
disperse.
justice
david
h.
souter
all
right.
what
about
an
ordinance
that
does
not
have
the
feature
of
no
apparent
purpose,
but
simply
provides
that
whenever,
let's
say,
five
or
more
individuals
reasonably
suspected
of
being
gang
members
are
seen
standing
and
not
moving
on
a
public
street,
they
may
be
ordered
to
disperse,
the
justification
legislatively
being
that
we
can
simply...
we
can
simply
prove,
based
on
experience,
that
whenever
you
have
a
congregation
of
gang
members
trouble
is
soon
to
follow.
constitutional?
justice
david
h.
souter
why?
justice
david
h.
souter
we
don't
have
the
purpose
problem
here.
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
there's
no
vagueness
problem,
and
there's
no
discretion
problem--
justice
david
h.
souter
--so
we're
into
substantive
due
process.
justice
david
h.
souter
sure,
but
it's
also
extraordinarily
vague.
here,
we
don't
have
that
kind
of
vagueness
problem.
we've
got
gang
membership.
we've
got
a
legislative
predicate
that
congregations
of
individuals
with
gang
memberships
tends
to
lead
to
the
effectuation
of
the
gang's
purposes.
we're
not
affecting
anybody
else.
the
nongang
members
are
not
involved,
so
none
of
those
problems.
aren't
you
really
forced
to
say
that
gang
members,
too,
have
a
right
to
congregate
on
the
street,
and
that
is
a
substantive
right?
wouldn't
that
have
to
be
the
basis
for
your
objection?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
what
is
specifically
the
activity
that
you're
concerned
about
in
the
congregation
of
the
five
gang
members,
speech?
i
mean,
is
that
it?
they
want
to
talk
to
each
other.
