justice
antonin
scalia
--you
think
that
would
be
okay.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
it
isn't
really
loitering.
it's
prohibited...
it's
loitering
with
a
member
of
a
street
gang.
justice
antonin
scalia
let's
just
take
loitering.
i
guess,
what
i
gather
from
your
response
to
justice
ginsburg,
that
you
concede
that
loitering
is
a
constitutionally
protected
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
is
it
better
than
smoking
cigarettes,
for
example,
which,
you
know,
people
used
to
have
a
right
to
do--
justice
antonin
scalia
--and
the
state
decides
it's
a
bad
idea,
so
it
prohibits
it.
why
is
loitering
above
smoking
cigarettes,
for
example?
justice
antonin
scalia
much
less
loitering
with
a
member
of
a
gang.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
does
the
law
require
minimal
standards?
justice
antonin
scalia
to
give...
but
to
give
adequate
notice,
i
assume.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
this
is
a
facial
attack,
so
that
if
there
is...
i
guess
theoretically
if
there
is
any
direction
to
the
police
which
would
render
it
constitutional
it
would
be
okay,
but
you're
appealing
to
one
that
is
actually
extant.
justice
antonin
scalia
you're
going
to
say
that
if
that
is
followed
at
least
it's
okay,
so
a
facial
attack--
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
grossman,
do
you
know
anybody
who
would
rather
smoke
a
cigarette
in
a
bar
than
stand
on
the
street?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
know
several
people
like
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
they're
disabled
from
doing
it,
and
nobody
thinks
it's
a
problem.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
what
issue,
whether
you
can
prohibit
loitering?
justice
antonin
scalia
this
is
admittedly
a
prophylactic
measure,
and
maybe
sometimes
it
will
pick
up
situations
that
were
not
dangerous,
but
how
do
you
distinguish
it
from,
as
far
as
police
discretion
is
concerned,
nighttime
road
blockades
to
check
for
drunken
drivers?
justice
antonin
scalia
now,
that's
a
situation
where
you're
stopping
somebody's
freedom
to
move
instead
of
somebody's
freedom
to
stand
still,
but
it's
entirely
up
to
the
policeman
at
the
blockade
which
car
he's
going
to
stop
and
which
car
he
isn't
going
to
stop.
is
the
constitutional
right
to
move
any
greater
than
this
constitutional
right
to
stand
still?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
isn't
that
entirely
up
to
the
discretion
of
the
police
officer
to
say
it's
okay?
justice
antonin
scalia
regulatory
in
nature?
that
makes
the
difference
for
the
constitution?
here
you're--
justice
antonin
scalia
--wow.
justice
antonin
scalia
protecting
against
drunken
drivers
is
better
than
protecting
against
criminals?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
grossman,
the
section
reads
this
way.
i
don't
see
how
you
can
say
that.
it
reads,
whenever
a
police
officer
believes
a
person
he
reasonably...
observes
a
person
he
reasonably
believes
to
be
a
criminal
street
gang
member
loitering
in
any
public
place
with
one
or
more
other
persons,
he
shall
order
all
such
persons
to
disperse
and
remove
themselves
from
the
area.
any
person
who
does
not
promptly
obey
such
an
order
is
in
violation
of
this
section.
it
doesn't
say
that
anybody
else
is
in
violation
of
the
section.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
disagree
with
the
words
of
the
statute?
justice
antonin
scalia
has
anybody
been
charged
who
did
not
disobey
a
police
order
to
disperse?
justice
antonin
scalia
is
there
anybody
who
has
been
charged
at
all
in
chicago
who
did
not
disobey
a
police
order
to
disperse?
justice
antonin
scalia
are
you
answering
my
question--
justice
antonin
scalia
--or
some
other
question?
justice
antonin
scalia
do
you
know
of
any--
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
asking
whether
he
was
charged.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
as
far
as
you
know,
everyone
who
has
been
charged
has
been
charged
with
disobeying
the
order
to
disperse?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
you
don't
know
of
anybody
else
who
has
been
charged
who
hasn't
been
charged
with
failing
to
disobey
the
order?
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
other--
justice
antonin
scalia
--if
they
will
accommodate
by
engaging
in
criminal
conduct
while
the
police
officer
is
looking
at
them.
justice
antonin
scalia
as
soon
as
they
see
a
police
car
in
the
area
they
just
hang
out,
and
that's
the
problem.
justice
antonin
scalia
their
mere
presence
hanging
out
terrorizes
the
neighborhood
and
prevents
the
people
of
the
neighborhood
from
using
the
streets.
justice
antonin
scalia
some
of
the
problem
is
not
just
dealing
drugs.
some
of
the
problem
is
simply
the
maintenance
of
gangs.
gangs
perpetuate
themselves
by
showing
themselves
publicly,
by
showing
off
being
on
the
street
with
a
bunch
of
other
members
of
the
gang,
whether
they're
dealing
drugs
or
not,
and
that's
how
gang
violence
occurs.
one
gang
comes
and
shoots
up
the
other
one
and
so
forth.
don't
they
have
a
right
to
stop
that
kind
of
activity?
justice
antonin
scalia
don't
the
police
rules
handle
that?
don't
the
police
rules
say,
only
certain
neighborhoods
will
be
targeted
where,
indeed,
there
is
this
gang
activity?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
you're
making
a
facial
challenge
here.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
seems
to
me
chicago
has
tried
to
implement
it
in
a
way
that
will
only
identify
what
you
call
the
hot
spots.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
if
you
say
you
can
designate
thousands
of
areas
under
it,
you're
denying
the
fact
that
the
ordinance
can
reasonably
be
limited
in
our
review
of
it
by
what
has
been
in
fact
provided
in
the
police
regulation
implementing
the
ordinance.
justice
antonin
scalia
in
theory,
you
could
designate
millions
of
places,
but
they
say,
we
will
only
designate
those
places
that
are
hot
spots.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
don't
care,
maybe
there
are
thousands...
do
you
know
that
there
are
not
thousands
and
thousands
of
hot
spots?
justice
antonin
scalia
protesting
in
front
of
an
embassy
is
a
first
amendment
activity.
i
mean,
to
compare
this
hanging
out
on
a
street
corner
with
a
desire
to
make
first
amendment
statements
of
protest
seems
to
me
entirely
unrealistic.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
was
obviously
directed
at
protests
in
front
of
embassies
that
were
intending
to
make
first
amendment
points.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
disagree
that
it
was
treated
as
a
first
amendment
case,
as
a
first
amendment
problem
by
the
court,
and
is
this
case
a
first
amendment
case?
justice
antonin
scalia
the
issue
as
to
whether
it's
a
first
amendment
case
is
whether
the
ordinance
is
directed
at
first
amendment
activities.
any
law
can
affect
first
amendment
activities.
the
law
prohibiting
smoking
in
bars
stops
some
people
from
going
in
bars,
wherefore
they
cannot
converse
with
the
bartender.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
you
say
there
is
a
constitutional
right
to
loiter.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
thought
that's
what
your
point
was.
justice
antonin
scalia
they're
probably
complaining
about
the
police,
which
is--
justice
antonin
scalia
which
is,
you
know,
the
height
of
first
amendment
protest
activity.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
about
the
assertion
in
the
petitioner's
brief
that
in
the
last
year
in
which
the
ordinance
was
enforced,
gang
related
homicides
dropped
26
percent,
a
considerable...
considerably
steeper
decline
than
the
9
percent
drop
in
the
overall
homicide
rate,
and
that
in
the
first
year
in
which
the
ordinance
was
not
enforced
because
it
was
enjoined,
although
the
overall
homicide
rate
fell
another
4
percent,
the
level
of
gang
related
homicide
increased
7
percent.
do
you
contest
those
figures?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
i
thought
you
also
assumed
that
in
the
ordinary
case
there
wouldn't
be
terrorized
local
residents
of
the
housing
projects
hanging
out
on
the
corner
with
the
gang
members.
justice
antonin
scalia
sort
of
a
birds
of
a
feather
flock
together
principle.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
think,
this
is
a
very
important
case
and
so
we
would
like
to
state
briefly,
some
of
the
reasons
for
my
dissent.
i
think
today's
judgment
is
regrettable,
encouraging
upon
the
peoples
right
to
govern
themselves.
all
human
society
is
based
on
an
agreement
by
human
beings
to
give
up
certain
rights
they
would
otherwise
have
in
order
to
obtain
certain
benefits.
right
to
drive
a
car
at
whatever
speed
is
safe
under
the
circumstances,
a
perfectly
innocent
act,
is
yielded
in
favor
of
rigid
speed
limits,
in
order
to
gain
the
benefit
of
greater
safety.
the
constitution
makes
exceptions
for
certain
right
that
cannot
be
abridged,
freedom
of
speech
for
example.
none
of
the
justices
today
contends
that
the
activity
regulated
by
the
chicago's
ordinance
is
such
a
specially
protected
right.
it
can
best
be
described
as
"loitering"
which
justice
thomas's
opinion
shows
has
been
regulated
throughout
our
history.
it
is
a
constitutionally
protected
activity
only
in
the
sense
that
all
activity
is
constitutionally
protected,
riding
a
bike,
driving
a
car,
building
a
house
or
selling
a
product,
the
equal
protection
clause
guarantees
that
no
activity
can
be
prohibited
without
a
reason.
the
reason
here
however
was
quite
clear.
street
gangs
held
the
citizens
of
inner
city
chicago,
hostage
in
their
own
homes.
they
terrorized
residents
by
visibly
occupying
street
corners
and
parks,
dealing
in
drugs,
intimidating
passers
by,
recruiting
new
members
and
perhaps
most
important
of
all,
demonstrating
their
control
over
the
neighborhood.
the
fact
that
the
ordinance
wasn't
enforced
by
the
police
in
all
neighborhoods
as
justice
steven's
described
was
an
indication
of
how
reasonable
the
police
were
being,
not
how
unreasonable
they
were
being.
there
were
certain
neighborhoods
that
were
threatened
and
other
neighborhoods
that
weren't.
normal
criminal
laws
had
proved
ineffective
to
solve
the
problem,
whenever
the
police
came
by,
any
unlawful
activity
would
usually
seize
and
there
was
no
law
against
dominating
a
neighborhood.
so
the
citizens
of
chicago
decided
that
to
eliminate
this
scourge,
they
would
limit
their
freedom
to
loiter,
not
much
of
limitation.
you
could
not
be
seeing
to
be
loitering
in
the
company
of
a
gang
member;
if
you
were,
you
were
not
punished
but
were
just
asked
to
move
on,
if
you
disobey
that
order
that
order
to
move
on
you
were
guilty
of
a
misdemeanor.
the
majority
today
in
various
opinions
gives
various
explanations
of
why
this
is
any
different
from
the
laws
that
exist
in
many
communities,
in
my
opinion,
i
called
one
from
new
york
which
permit
policemen
to
tell
innocent
citizens
to
move
along
on
pain
of
arrest
when
the
public
interest
requires
it.
when
for
example,
that
are
standing
around
walking
at
the
scene
of
an
accident
or
obstructing
a
medical
emergency
scene,
or
any
other
of
a
million
unpredictable
situations.
before
i
discuss,
why
the
majority
says
this
law
is
different,
i
must
note
one
peculiar
feature
about
the
approach,
the
majority
takes.
when
a
policeman
tells
you
to
move
along
without
a
good
reason,
or
indeed
for
a
positively
bad
reason
just
likely
your
free
speech
activity
for
example,
you
of
course
have
the
ability
to
challenge
that
application
of
the
ordinance
to
you
in
the
circumstances.
that
is
called
an
"as
applied
challenge",
you
are
asserting
not
that
law
is
a
way
unconstitutional
but
that
is
unconstitutional
as
it
has
been
employed.
the
challenge
in
this
case
is
not
an
as
applied
challenge.
the
respondents
here
contended
that
this
chicago
ordinance
was
invalid
in
all
its
applications.
ordinarily,
to
sustain
such
a
challenge
you
must
show
that
there
is
no
conceivable
set
of
action,
which
the
ordinance
could
not
be
constitutionally
applied.
today's
opinions
simply
do
not
sustain
that
burden.
some
of
the
justices
contend
the
law
is
too
vague,
to
give
the
citizens
notice
of
the
prohibited
conduct,
but
the
only
prohibited
conduct,
the
only
conduct
punished
is
the
failure
to
obey
a
police
order
to
move
on
and
that
is
as
clear
as
can
be.
the
justices
in
majority
also
say
that
the
ordinance
does
not
give
the
police
officer
clear
enough
instruction
so
that
he
will
be
able
to
hassle,
just
about
anybody
at
will,
but
that
is
not
so.
he
must
first
of
all
identify
a
non-gang
member
and
the
police
regulations
which
implement
this
ordinance
require
serious
identification,
he
must
then
conclude
that
the
group
is
remaining
in
one
place
with
no
apparent
purpose.
not
that
the
group
has
no
purpose,
they
may
be
talking,
rollerblading,
singing
gang
songs,
or
rapping
gang
rap,
but
that
the
group
has
no
apparent
purpose
for
remaining
in
one
place.
if
that
were
not
easy
enough
to
discern,
there
would
be
no
english
word
loiter.
this
ordinance
is
infinitely,
more
specific
in
its
directive
to
the
police,
than
many
general
ordinances
that
allow
the
police
to
order
crowds
to
disperse
whenever
the
public
interest
demands
it,
anything
from
a
bomb
scare
to
a
medical
emergency.
although,
the
majority
opinions
talk
constantly
of
vague
notice
to
the
citizens
and
vague
instruction
to
the
police,
i
doubt
that
that
is
what
is
driving
today's
judgment.
for
the
majority's
opinions
suggest
that
the
ordinance
might
have
been
okay,
if
it
had
applied
only
to
gang
members,
but
how
could
that
render
it
any
less
vague?
what
that
suggests
and
indicates
i
think
is
that
what
underlies
today's
judgment
is
simply
the
feeling
which
is
indeed
expressed
in
several
of
the
opinions
that
the
ordinance
covers
too
much
innocent
conduct,
but
that
is
not
a
judgment
for
this
court,
it
is
a
judgment
for
the
citizens
of
chicago.
so
long
as
a
specially
protected
constitutional
right
is
not
at
issue
such
as
freedom
of
speech,
it
is
up
to
them
whether
to
prate
their
right
to
hang
out
in
the
company
of
a
gang
member,
in
exchange
for
liberation
from
gang
dominance
of
their
neighborhoods.
just
as
it
is
up
to
them
whether
to
exchange
their
freedom
to
make
a
right
turn
on
red
in
exchange
for
greater
pedestrian
safety.
i
feel
although
worst
about
the
court's
interference
with
the
democratic
decisions
made
here
because
the
decision
seems
to
be
such
a
eminently
reasonable
one.
i
would
trade
my
right
to
loiter
in
the
company
of
a
gang
member
in
exchange
for
the
liberation
of
my
neighborhood
in
an
instant.
it
is
wrong
not
to
permit
to
believer
citizens
of
chicago
to
do
so.
