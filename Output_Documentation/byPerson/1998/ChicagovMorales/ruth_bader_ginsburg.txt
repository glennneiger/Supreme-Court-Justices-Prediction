mr.
rosenthal,
are
you
saying,
then,
that
if
the
law...
simply
read,
it
would
be
much
easier
if
a
police
officer
gives
you
a
command
to
disperse
and
you
don't
obey
you've
committed
an
offense.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
you
think
that
that's...
if
the
chicago
ordinance
said
nothing
but
that,
you
think
it
would
be
constitutional?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
other
problems?
if
it
simply
said,
the
police
ordered
you
to
disperse,
you
disperse,
otherwise
you've
committed
an
offense--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
suppose,
mr.
rosenthal,
the
streets
would
be
cleaner
and
clearer
if
the
city
just
said,
anyone
who
loiters
in
a
public
place
and
doesn't
move
when
told
to
move
on
commits
an
offense.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
would
you
defend
the
constitutionality
of
such
a
statute
that
said,
anyone
who
loiters
and
is
told
to
move
on
commits
an
offense?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
this
isn't
the
court's
first
encounter
with
a
loitering
statute,
and
there
are
cases
like
papachristou,
where
the
court
found,
at
least
those
statutes
were
problematic
because
of
the
discretion
given
to
the
officers.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
thought
the
designated
areas
were
not
known
to
the
public.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
may
i
just
ask
if
you
would
apply
that
same
reasoning
to...
if
the
statute
said,
instead
of
gang
member,
reasonably
suspected
of
being
a
prostitute,
reasonably
suspected
of
being
a
beggar?
they
would
all
be
equally
effective.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
how
about
if
they
just
cut
out
the
nongang
members?
everything
else
is
the
same,
but
the
only
one
that
the
police
can
arrest
is
someone
reasonably
suspected
to
be
a
gang
member.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
this
order
is
not
currently
enforced
because
of
the
illinois
supreme
court
decision,
is
that
right?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
has
there
been
a
substitute?
has
there
been
some
alternate
technique
used?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
sweeps
under
what
statute,
if
this
ordinance
is
no
good?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
rosenthal,
would
you
explain
why
their
purpose
wouldn't
be
accomplished
as
well
if
the
only
target
of
the
arrest
and
the
crime
were
the
suspected
gang
member?
