justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--suppose
the
hypothetical
were
changed
so
that
it
says,
the
police
give
you
a
lawful
order
to
disperse.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
which
means
that
they
would
have
to
have
good
reason.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
suppose--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
when
he
tells
them
to
disperse,
does
he
tell
them
why?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
assume
that
there's
fair
notice
for
purposes
of
my
question.
i
want
you
to
get
back
to
where
you
were
going,
what
you
call
substantive,
or
maybe
it's
procedural.
i'm
not
sure
what
kind
of
due
process,
but
think
of
not
the
category
of
gang
members...
gangs
mean
people
who
engage
in
very
serious
crimes...
but
people
who
are
not
members
of
the
gang.
the
ordinance
seems
to
say
on
its
face
that
all
the
people
who
are
not
members
of
the
gangs
in
this
ordinance
can't
use
the
public
streets
to
stand
in
when
a
gang
member
is
present.
now,
that
i
have
to
say,
to
me
anyway,
is
of
some
concern.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
it
says
the
police
shall
order
them
to
disperse,
so
if
you
read
this
statute
it
says
that
the
people
who
are
not
gang
members
who
are
standing
on
a
public
street
and
want
to
talk
to
a
member
of
the
gang,
or
he's
one
of
the
group,
that
they
can't
stand
on
that
street
because
if
a
policeman
comes
along
he
shall
order
them
to
disperse.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
oh,
no,
no,
there
are
some
gang
members
and
some
nongang
members.
i
take
it
a
lot
of
people
stand
around
on
the
street.
i
doubt
that
there's
evidence
here
that
says
the
only
people
who
stand
on
the
street,
even
in
the
worst
neighborhood
problem
areas,
are
just
gang
members.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
can
a
city
council
pass
an
ordinance
that
says,
we've
had
some
gang
problems
in
a
certain
area.
therefore,
no
one
can
stand
on
the
street.
no
one.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
nothing
vague
about
it.
i'm
asking
you
if--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
agree.
that's
right.
so
can
they
do
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
as
long
as
it's...
is
that...
but
i
don't
want
you
to
stop
now.
if
i...
if...
is
that
the
standard
for
people
being
able
to
stand
on
the
street?
i
mean,
all
they
want
to
do,
innocent,
not
members
of
the
gang,
i
want
to
stand
on
the
street
today.
that's...
i...
my
house
isn't
very
big,
and
it's
unpleasant
there,
and
it's
hot,
and
i
want
to
go
and
stand
on
the
street
and
talk
to
people.
some
of
my
friends
are
gang
members,
i
agree.
now,
the
city
council
says,
you
can't,
all
right.
what's
the
standard
that
we're
supposed
to
judge
under
the
constitution
whether
they
can
do
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
what,
in
your
opinion,
could...
look,
what
could
chicago
do?
what
they're
saying,
and
they
have
something
in
the
record
to
support
them,
is
that
in
these
neighborhoods
the
choice
is
who
will
stand
on
the
sidewalk.
either
poor
people,
who
are
not
members
of
groups
that
murder,
sell
drugs...
you
know,
it's
defined,
a
gang
is
defined
as
a
group
of
people
who
have
substantial
activities
are
murder,
drugs,
et
cetera.
they
say
that
the
terrible
choice
is,
either
they
stand
on
the
sidewalk,
or
people
who
are
poor
and
honest
stand
on
the
sidewalk.
you
can't
do
both.
and
they
have
drafted
an
ordinance
that
you
think
has
many
flaws
in
it.
is
it
your
view
that
the
constitution
says,
if
that
factual
predicate
is
true
the
poor
people
have
to
stay
in
their
houses,
or
is
it
your
view
that
it
is
possible
to
draft
an
ordinance
that
would
satisfy
this...
their
need
and,
if
so,
what?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
we
do
give...
i'm
thinking
of
justice
stevens'
hypothetical
statute.
three
or
more
members
of
an
organization
that
has
a
substantial
activity,
murdering
people
et
cetera,
they
can't
use
the
street
to
stand
around
in.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
they,
the
statute
says,
can't
use
the
street
to
stand
around
in.
not
some
other
people,
but
they
can't
use
the
street
to
stand
around
in.
now,
if
the
constitution
permits
quite
a
lot
of
authority
to
be
given
to
traffic
policemen
to
control
the
streets
because
driving
risks
death,
why
doesn't
it
give
the
police
a
similar
kind
of
discretion
to
control
the
movements
of
gang
members
on
the
street,
because
after
all
there's
also
that
kind
of
a
risk.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
thought
he
said
that
about
33
out
of
the
100
or
something,
a
lot
of
them
are
not
gang
members
who
are
being--
