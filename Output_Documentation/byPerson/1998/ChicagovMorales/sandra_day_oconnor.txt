well,
i
think
you
have
to
assume
that
the
ordinance
is
broad
enough
that
some
people
would
not
know
they
happen
to
have
a
gang
member
present.
i
mean,
maybe
some
would,
maybe
some
wouldn't.
has
any
attempt
been
made
in
any
other
city
ordinance
to
focus
on
some
action
by
the
so
called
gang,
intimidation
of
people,
or
seeking
to
obtain
physical
control
of
an
area
for
some
illicit
purpose?
i
mean,
if
it
were
something
like
that
in
the
ordinance,
then
it
seems
to
me
people
would
understand
if
they
engaged
in
activity
like
that--

sandra

--that
it's--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--suspect.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
there
is
a
concern
here,
of
course,
as
well
with
the
potential
for
arbitrariness
by
the
police
in
interpreting
it.
you
could
have
a
situation
as,
i
assume,
in
many
poor
neighborhoods
of
the
country
where
some
person
might
be
trying
to
persuade
gang
members
to
change
their
ways,
and
be
out
on
the
streets
where
they're
gathered
to
talk
to
them.
now,
the
officer
wouldn't
be
able
to
detect
an
apparent
purpose.
it's
just
a
bunch
of
people
including
a
gang
member
or
two
standing
around
on
the
street,
so
it's
open
to
the
officer
to
say,
outta
here.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
that's
the
concern.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
do
most
loitering
laws
refer
to
specific
places
where
you
can't
loiter,
in
public
rest
rooms,
or
around
schoolyards,
or
something
like
that?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--i
can
understand
a
zoning
approach
where
you
concluded
in
certain
areas,
public
areas
it's
sufficiently
dangerous
that
it
ought
to
be
prohibited
altogether.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
oh,
but
that's
not
on
the
face
of
the
statute.
the
public
doesn't
know
that,
presumably.
