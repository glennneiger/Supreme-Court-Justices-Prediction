this
is
a
case
about
the
character
and
growth
capacity
of
the
equitable
remedial
authority
of
federal
court.
in
my
view,
the
court
relies
on
an
unjustifiably
static
conception
of
that
authority
and
thereby
exposes
us
lenders
to
risks
lessened
for
lenders
in
other
systems.
we
have
priced
since
our
earliest
decisions,
the
adaptable
quality
of
federal
equitable
authority.
the
remedy
granted
by
the
district
court
in
this
case
and
approved
by
the
court
of
appeals,
i
am
persuaded
was
not
beyond
equity’s
capacity.
the
district
court
faced
uncontested
evidence
that
the
debtor
gmd
had
defaulted
on
its
contractual
obligation
to
the
creditor
alliance
and
had
no
plausible
defense
to
the
lawsuit.
gmd
had
agreed
to
treat
its
debt
to
alliance
on
a
par
with
all
other
unsecured,
unsubordinated
debt
but
gmd
was
in
fact,
disposing
of
its
sold
assets
to
mexican
creditors
to
the
exclusion
of
alliance.
gmd
was
disbursing
that
asset
so
rapidly
that
as
since
the
interim
relief
granted
by
the
district
court,
alliance
could
not
have
collected
a
penny
on
the
multimillion
dollar
judgment
it
eventually
obtained.
the
district
court
acted
moderately
it
sought
only
to
preserve
the
status
quo
for
a
span
of
less
than
four
months,
until
the
case
could
be
fully
and
fairly
adjudicated
in
a
busy,
but
efficiently
operated
court.
the
court
is
still
ready
to
modify
its
preliminary
injunction
if
necessary
to
keep
gmd
in
business.
the
court
correctly
reports
that
equity
courts
traditionally
did
not
stop
parties
sued
for
an
unsecured
debt
from
disposing
of
assets,
pending
the
litigation.
but,
some
24
years
ago
the
place
where
the
tradition
originated,
inaugurated
a
new
tradition
one
responsive
to
current
conditions
in
the
society
that
equity
exists
to
serve.
other
common
law
jurisdictions
have
followed
the
lead
of
the
english
courts,
but
for
the
united
states
this
court
declares
“old
ways
hold
sway”.
the
court
made
tradition
on,
which
this
court
relies,
may
have
suited
an
age
of
slow
moving
capital
and
comparatively
immobile
wealth.
but,
today’s
the
technology
facilitates
the
near
instantaneous
transfer
of
assets
here
and
abroad,
enabling
borrowers
to
escape
meritorious
claims
in
ways
unimaginable
to
an
18th
century
chancellor.
an
equity
power
capable
of
implementing
the
desegregation
mandate
of
brown
v.
board
of
education
or
superintending
intricate
programs
of
corporate
divestiture
is
surely
simple
enough
to
encompass
the
modest
interim
remedy
at
state
here.
unless
we
disarm
the
district
courts,
because
authority
to
grant
a
provisional
remedy
could
be
abused,
because
district
judges
have
different
shoe
sizes.
abuse
in
my
judgment
is
unlikely,
if
we
hold
to
the
standards
that
ordinarily
govern
preliminary
injunctive
relief.
those
standards
are
that
the
plaintiff
must
show
unlikelihood
of
success
on
the
merits
and
irreparable
injury
absent
in
interim
remedy.
both
of
those
showings
were
well
made
here.
taking
account
of
the
office
of
equity,
the
facts
of
this
case,
and
the
moderate
status
quo
preserving
quality
of
the
remedy,
denial
of
interim
relief,
essential
to
an
effective
final
judgment
seems
to
me
remarkably
inequitable.
