unknown
speaker
mr.
mescon,
do
you
mind
giving
us
a
little
preliminary
information
here?
i'm
concerned
basically
with
a
potential
mootness
problem.
your
suit,
your
petition
rests,
i
take
it,
on...
on
an...
an
allegation
that
your
client
is
entitled
to
damages
by
virtue
of
an
improper
preliminary
injunction.
unknown
speaker
and
there's
a
bond
outstanding--
unknown
speaker
--which
could
be...
the
damages
could
be
secured
from
the
bond.
but
as
i
understand
it,
the
preliminary
injunction
has
become
a
final
injunction.
is
that
right?
unknown
speaker
and
no
appeal
was
taken
from
that.
unknown
speaker
is
that
right?
unknown
speaker
okay.
so,
tell
me
what's
left
and
why
we
should
be
deciding
it.
unknown
speaker
and
on
that,
you
rest
on
new
york
law
basically.
unknown
speaker
what
are
your
damages
from...
what...
what
would
you
receive
if
you
showed
that
the
preliminary
injunction
was
wrong
even
though
the...
the
final
injunction
is
okay?
unknown
speaker
well,
but
it
shouldn't
have
been
doing
that
anyway.
i
mean,
doesn't
the
preliminary
injunction
say
that,
in
effect,
it
would
have
been
wrongful
to
do
that?
unknown
speaker
not
the
preliminary.
the
final
injunction.
unknown
speaker
you're
talking
about
a
period
then
just
between
the
issuance
of
the
preliminary
injunction
and
the
final
injunction.
unknown
speaker
and
you
say
that
that
caused
discrete,
demonstrable
damages
to
your
client.
unknown
speaker
that's
the
theory
of
your
case.
unknown
speaker
the
theory
behind
that
is
that
it
may
entirely
be
proper
now
to
enjoin
a
certain
use
of
those
assets,
but
it
would
not
have
been
wrong
to
use
those
assets
for
the
other
purposes,
for
want
of
which
you
have
sustained
damages.
unknown
speaker
mr.
mescon,
i
thought
judge
martin
said,
look,
i
basically
want
to
make
sure
that
if
there
is,
as
i
think
there
will
be,
a
judgment
for
the
plaintiff,
there's
something
to
realize
it
against,
but
i
don't
want
to
be
rigid
about
this.
didn't
he
say
that
you
could
come
back?
he
said,
grupo
may
seek
modification
on
a
showing
of
some
need
in
order
to
keep
the
company
going.
given...
given
that
opportunity
that
he
gave
you,
he
didn't
say
you're
immobile.
he
said,
if
you
have
a
good
reason
to
relax
the
injunction,
come
tell
me
and
we'll
talk
about
it.
unknown
speaker
for
parties
other
than
this
plaintiff.
unknown
speaker
for
parties
other
than
this
plaintiff.
unknown
speaker
so,
the...
what
you...
you
are
arguing
essentially,
if
i
understand
you,
that
you
wanted
to
be
able
to
deal
with
your
other
creditors
so
that
there
would
not
be...
the
consequence
of
that
would...
there
would
not
be
these
assets
against
which
the
final
decision
could
be
realized.
unknown
speaker
so...
but
the
judges...
we're
talking
about
a
3
and
a
half
month
period?
unknown
speaker
and
you
said
something
about
the
court
hasn't
power
to
do
this
preliminarily,
and
one
of
the
reasons
was,
you
said,
in
new
york
they
wouldn't
do
it.
suppose
new
york
law
were
otherwise.
suppose
new
york
law
says,
if
you
make
out
a
very
strong
case
on
the
merits
and
also
a
very
strong
case
that
unless
there's
an
injunction
during
the
pendency
of
the
suit,
the
assets
will
be
gone.
we
will
give
you
that
freeze
worldwide.
suppose
that
were
the
new
york
law.
what
does
the
federal
court
do?
unknown
speaker
but
now
we're
in
the
erie
days.
unknown
speaker
but
you
say
we
don't
have
to
decide
that
as...
as
things
are
in
this
case.
unknown
speaker
you're
fortunately
spared
the--
unknown
speaker
--well,
does...
does
it
work
the
other
way
around?
does
the
absence
of
a
state
mechanism
to
do
this
mean
that
under
erie
the
federal
court
may
not
do
it?
unknown
speaker
even
if
the
rules
explicitly
gave
the
court
authority?
unknown
speaker
you
should
make
that
clear.
unknown
speaker
you're
saying
neither...
neither
rule
64
nor
65
authorize
what
was
done
here.
unknown
speaker
what
do
you
do...
suppose
a
sues
b
in
new
york,
a
damage
action,
and
a
learns
that
b
is
about
to
transfer
property
in
new
jersey
to
a
relative,
a
fraudulent
conveyance,
and
there
won't
be
enough
money
around
otherwise
to
satisfy
the
judgment.
that
must
be
somewhat
common.
i
mean,
it's
occurred
before.
is
he
without
a
remedy,
the
plaintiff
in
new
york?
unknown
speaker
yes,
yes.
unknown
speaker
yes,
of
course.
you'd
attach
it
and
get
an
attachment
action
in
new
york.
you
get
one
in
new
jersey.
unknown
speaker
so,
what
we
have
is
a...
is
a
different
route
in
new
york
of
accomplishing
the
exactly
precise
same
objective.
unknown
speaker
no,
indeed.
i
guess
since
fraudulent
conveyance
is
a
legal
action
in
fact...
it's
not
an
action
in
equity...
the...
we
have
an
instance
where
a
new
york
court
would,
indeed,
permit
an
injunction
to
protect
a
judgment
that's
all
legal.
all
legal.
unknown
speaker
no,
no,
but
what
they
do
is
get
to
the
same
result
in
a
different
way.
unknown
speaker
all
right.
so,
in
fact,
why
can't
the
federal
court,
although
it
doesn't
have
exactly
the
same
legal
mechanisms
because
they're
not
involved
in
exactly
the
same
thing,
get
to
precisely
the
same
result,
which
is
in
fact
to
attach
property
abroad
to
satisfy
a
likely
judgment
in
a
legal
action?
unknown
speaker
don't
call
it
attachment.
unknown
speaker
but,
of
course,
they
do
in
fact
have
that
very
power
if
the
underlying
action
is
equitable.
unknown
speaker
and
do
they--
--mr.
mescon,
i
suppose
that
hanging
a
guilty
person
without
a
trial
achieves
the
same
result
in
a
different
way,
doesn't
it?
unknown
speaker
i
wasn't
talking
about
that.
it's
not
permissible,
is
it?
unknown
speaker
right,
and
what
happens--
unknown
speaker
--we
accept
that.
suppose
it
was
just...
because
this
is
an
odd
example,
but
i
think
it
makes
the
point.
suppose
it
were
an
action
for
a
fraudulent
conveyance?
unknown
speaker
mr.
mescon,
i...
i
thought
that
the
reason
for
new
york's...
i
mean,
new
york
lets
you
put
your
hands
on
anything
that's
in
new
york...
that
what
was
behind
new
york's
limitation
is
the
notion
that
new
york
lacks
the
power
until
there's
a
final
judgment
to
put
a
freeze
on
assets
outside.
and
if
that's
so,
if
it
isn't
a
question
of
new
york's
policy
of
protecting
this
debtor
from
having
its
assets
touched,
but
new
york's
notion
of
its
own
powerlessness
that's
at
work,
why
should
that
be
applicable
in
the
federal
court
which
doesn't
have
that
powerlessness?
unknown
speaker
and...
and
i
don't
want
to
interrupt
your
extended
answer
to
the
question,
but
these
are...
are
these
intangibles?
are
promissory
notes
intangibles?
unknown
speaker
the
promissory
notes
in...
in
question
here.
unknown
speaker
the
notes
they
received
from
the
mexican
government.
unknown
speaker
right.
if...
would
the
case
be
different
if
those
notes
physically
had
been
in
some
safe
deposit
box
of
a
chase
manhattan
bank
in...
in
new
york?
unknown
speaker
so
the...
the
location
of
the
security
itself
is
significant.
unknown
speaker
it
depends
on
the
choice
of
law
theory,
of
which
there
are
millions.
right?
unknown
speaker
i
mean,
you
can't
give
a
sure--
--well,
i...
i
might
have
intervened
with
your
answer
to
justice
ginsburg.
yes.
i
would
like
to
get
back
to
that.
it...
it
is
an
erie
question
that
i'm
asking.
unknown
speaker
i...
i
thought
that
the
erie
assessment
isn't
just
automatic.
well,
we
have
no
rule
on
point,
so
we
look
to
see
whatever
the
state
does.
i
thought
that
there
was
then
an
examination
to
determine
whether
the
state
has
any
relevant
policy.
and
it
may
be
that
the
state
has
a
policy.
in
fact,
most
cases
it
does.
but
if...
and
i
may
not
be
right
about
this.
if
the
state
is
not
putting
on
this
kind
of
freeze
because
it
thinks
it
can't
rather
than
because
it
has
made
a
judgment
that
is
not
a
sound
thing
to
do,
then
why
should
that
apply
in
the
federal
court?
unknown
speaker
let's
take
attachment
out
of
it
and
sequestration--
unknown
speaker
--well,
some
courts
have
had
a
notion
that
they
can't
act
extraterritorially.
unknown
speaker
well,
this...
now
you...
you
seem
to
be
cut
loose
from
what
you
said
earlier.
that
is,
you
said
new
york
could
have
such
a
preliminary
injunction.
if
new
york
has
a
preliminary
injunction,
it
would
apply
in
the
federal
courts.
unknown
speaker
so,
it
isn't
a
question
of
equity
would
not
permit
this
kind
of
thing.
it's
simply
a
question,
did
the
state
do
it,
and
you
say--
unknown
speaker
--suppose...
suppose
that
this...
that
this
court
thought
that
the
old
rule
should
be
changed,
that
we
have
a
global
economy
and
debtors
are
too
quickly
depriving
the
courts
of
real
jurisdiction.
it's
wrong
to
know
that
the
defendant
in
front
of
you
is
secreting
assets,
and
so
we
want
to
change
the
rule,
as
the
english
did
in...
was
it
mareva?
unknown
speaker
and
assume
the
court
wanted
to
do
that.
would
we
have
the
authority
to
do
that?
unknown
speaker
well,
you
say
guided
by
what
courts
of
equity
can
do.
suppose
we
think
the
old
equitable
rule
is
wrong
and
should
be
adjusted
to
the
new
dynamics
of
an
economy
and
so
forth.
unknown
speaker
you
may
disagree.
we're
just
making
the
assumption.
unknown
speaker
well,
just...
just
because
of
the
extant
equity
precedents?
unknown
speaker
or
because
of
any
other
proper
constraints
on
our
authority?
unknown
speaker
could
one
go
into
a
new
york
court,
the
supreme
court
of
new
york,
and
get
an
injunction
of
the
sort
that
was
issued
here?
unknown
speaker
and
why
is
that?
unknown
speaker
is
that
because
it's
covered
by
the
attachment
and
you...
you...
if
the
attachment
statute
sets
out
certain
requirements,
you
can't
beat...
you
can't
kind
of
go
on
the
side
door
and
get
an
injunction?
unknown
speaker
mr.
mescon,
you
did
say
that
new
york
would
give
this
injunction,
a
permanent
injunction.
we
have
a
permanent
injunction
which
you're
not
challenging.
unknown
speaker
and
apparently
new
york,
just
like
the
federal
court,
would
give
such
a
permanent
injunction
after
the
plaintiff
has
won
the
lawsuit.
going
back
to
justice
o'connor's
question,
have
courts
of
appeals
ever
ruled
on
the
validity
of
a
preliminary
injunction
once
the
final
injunction
has
been
entered?
unknown
speaker
well,
i...
i
don't
see
why
your
response
is...
is
that
narrow.
it
seems
to
me
that
you
might
have
a
perfectly
good
case
if
the
preliminary
injunction
was
improvidently
issued,
but
after
a
full
hearing,
a
permanent
injunction
issues,
and
you
don't
challenge
that.
there
was
enough
evidence
developed
on
the
permanent
injunction
hearing
that
you
don't
challenge
it.
but
it
seems
to
me
you're
still
entitled
to
challenge
the
preliminary
injunction
if
you
suffered
damages
and
there's
a
bond.
unknown
speaker
what
is
the--
unknown
speaker
--but
he
guessed...
but
he
guessed
right.
unknown
speaker
but
i
thought...
i
thought
your...
your
position...
correct
me
if
i'm
wrong...
is
that
there's
a
great
difference
from
an
injunction
before
we
have
adjudicated
that
there
is
a
debtor
and
an
injunction
after
there
has
been
adjudication
that
the
debt
is
owed.
unknown
speaker
did
you
actually
look
up
the...
and
the
reason
i'm
harping
on
this
odd
thing,
i
had
to
look
it
up
once
and
fraudulent
conveyances
are
legal
actions.
they're
not
actions
in
equity.
a
typical
case
is
a
case
where
a
sues
b
in
a
normal
damages
action,
and
then
he
thinks
that
b
is
going
to
convey
to
a
friend
some
property
and
b
is
likely
to
become
insolvent.
i'd
be
surprised
if
injunctions
weren't
issued
in
that
kind
of
case
to
prevent
a...
a...
maybe
rarely,
but
to
prevent
a
real
danger.
unknown
speaker
they're
not?
unknown
speaker
yes,
it
is.
it
is.
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask...
oh,
excuse
me.
you're
not
suggesting
that
new
jersey
is
more
unpleasant
than
new
york,
are
you?
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
mr.
mescon,
can
i
ask
you
a
practical...
how
long
did
the
trial
take
in
this...
trial
on
the
merits
in
this
case
take?
unknown
speaker
and
how
long
did
it
take
the
judge
to
decide
it?
unknown
speaker
i
was
just
wondering
if
the
judge...
if
you
win
and
the
judge
had
the
same
problem
all
over
again,
it
seemed
to
me
what
the
trial
judge
might
do
is
say
let's
go
to
trial
tomorrow,
put
your
evidence
in,
we'll
have
a
decision
on
the
merits
in
15
days.
so,
we
would...
and
then
you
would...
and
if
you
lost
on
the
merits
then,
you
would
have
no...
no
redress.
unknown
speaker
but
if
he
had
truncated
it
by
saying...
say,
he
did
have
the
power,
and
if
he
truncated
the
trial,
the
preliminary
injunction
hearing,
by
saying
i'm
going
to
rely
on
this
affidavit
as
enough
evidence
because
i'm
convinced
what
i'm
going
to
do
after
all
the
evidence
comes
in,
he
could
get
away
with
that.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
but
how
would
that
have
helped
in
a
world
where
you
can
transfer
money
in
5
minutes?
unknown
speaker
no,
but
i
mean,
if
it's
a
practical
thing
we're
looking
for,
if
you...
if
you
win
this,
then
in...
in
future
cases,
as
long
a
there's
5
minutes'
time
between
the
complaint
being
filed
and
the
trial
on
the
merits,
that's
the
same
as
if
there
were
10
years'
time.
unknown
speaker
very
well,
mr.
mescon.
mr.
days,
we'll
hear
from
you.
unknown
speaker
but...
but
here
the
theory
of
the
petitioner
is...
is
that
the
reason
any
mischief
happened
was
because
it
was
at
the
initial
injunction
stage.
unknown
speaker
it's
the
difference
between
the
preliminary
and
the
permanent
injunction
that
is
the
very
theory
of
his
case,
and
that
just
wasn't
involved
in
the
case
that
you
cite.
unknown
speaker
but
that
may
be
true,
mr.
days,
but
if...
if
the
petitioner
is
right,
that
the
authority
to
issue
the
preliminary
injunction
is...
is
nonexistent,
whereas
the
authority
to
issue
the
permanent
injunction
is
clear,
i
would
think
that
would
be
enough
to
at
least
give
the
structure
of
a
claim
for
damages
on
the
bond.
unknown
speaker
but
if...
if...
maybe
you
need
a
separate
suit
on
the
bond.
i
don't
mean
to
decide
that,
but
certainly
if
it
were
decided
by
this
court
that
the
issue
of
the
preliminary
injunction
in
this
case
were
improvident
or
unauthorized,
that
could
be
used
in
the
suit
on
the
bond,
could
it
not?
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
if
we
decide
he
was
laboring
under
a
misapprehension
as
to
what
his
authority
was
to
issue
a
preliminary
injunction,
then...
you
know,
that...
that
goes
to
the
merits
of
this
case
certainly
to
a
certain
extent.
then
that
would
certainly
be
binding
on
the
parties
in
a
suit
on
the
bond,
would
it
not?
unknown
speaker
well,
but,
mr.
days,
it
wouldn't
really...
it
wouldn't
really
open
up
that
pandora's
box
if
it
only
applied
to
cases
in
which
it
was
contended
that
there
was
an
absence
of
power
during
the
interval
between
the
time
of
the
preliminary
injunction
entered
and
the
judgment
in
the
case
was
entered
on
the
merits.
unknown
speaker
and
i
think
he
agrees
it
would
be
limited
to
that.
unknown
speaker
well,
that...
that
would
certainly
perhaps
be
a
defense
to
a
damage...
a
partial
defense
to
a
damages
action,
that
you
had
it
within
your
power
to
correct
this
situation
without
enduring
it.
but
i...
i
don't
think
that
dispenses
with
the
entire
case.
unknown
speaker
mr.
days,
do
you
think
that
the
merger
of
law
and
equity
enlarged
the...
the
kind
of
remedies
that
were
available?
unknown
speaker
but
do
you
think
that
if
a
court
of
equity
couldn't
have
given
it
before
there
was
a
judgment
and
then
you
merge
law
and
equity,
wouldn't
the
rules
still
be
the
same?
you
have
to...
you
know,
you
can
get
it
in
the
same
proceeding.
you
get
a
judgment,
then
you
get
an
injunction.
but
you
don't
get
an
injunction
before
that.
unknown
speaker
do
you
have
any
cases
to
the
contrary?
do
you
have
any
cases
where,
indeed,
an
injunction
of
this
sort
was
issued?
unknown
speaker
there
have
been
deadbeat
creditors...
deadbeat
debtors
who...
who
were
going
to
try
to
get
rid
of
their
property
forever.
and
now,
maybe
the
rule
that
we
have
is
not
a
good
rule,
and
henry
iv
notwithstanding.
but
the
issue
is
not
whether
we
can
change
it
really.
the
issue
is
whether
this
court
ought
to
be
the...
the
instrument
of
change
or
whether,
you
know,
it's
such
a
fundamental
departure
from
what...
what
courts
have
done
in
the
past,
that
if
indeed
we
want
to
give
creditors
more
rights
against
debtors
in
this
respect,
it
ought
to
be
a
congressional
determination.
i
mean,
that's...
that's
really
the
only
argument
here.
unknown
speaker
but
you
don't
have
a
single
case
that--
unknown
speaker
--are
you
saying
that
we're
doing
this
to
supplement
the
void
in
the
bankruptcy
laws?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
would
have
thought
that
would
have
been...
it's
your
argument,
not
mine...
not
a
bad
argument
because--
unknown
speaker
--assuming
the
assets
were,
say,
in
the
state
of
california--
unknown
speaker
--in
this
case,
gmd
had
its
assets,
i
take
it
you
could
have
initiated
an
involuntary
bankruptcy
proceeding?
unknown
speaker
all
right.
so,
then
why
aren't
i
correct
in
suggesting
that
what
you're
doing
is
simply
trying
to
cure
a
gap
or
a
void
in
the
bankruptcy
laws?
unknown
speaker
equity
simply
fills
in
any
gap
that
may
result
from
an
absence
of
a
bankruptcy
law
in
mexico?
unknown
speaker
but
it
seems
to
me--
unknown
speaker
--that's...
that's
the
minimum
of
what
you're
doing,
and
you
may
be
even
doing
more.
you
may
be
saying
even
if
they
can't
go
into
bankruptcy,
you
ought
to
be
able
to
attach
a
putative
debtor's
assets.
and
that's
a...
that's
a
sweeping
change
in
the
law.
unknown
speaker
i
take
it
you
say
that
the
reason
this
isn't
coming
up
a
lot
is
obvious.
there
are
attachment
statutes.
there
are
lots
of
other
remedies,
including
bankruptcy,
et
cetera.
and
so,
obviously...
but
why
isn't
it...
and
you're
going
to
agree
with
this.
what's
the
objection
to
it
is
what
i'm
looking
for.
the
best
evidence
of
what
i'm
about
to
say.
unknown
speaker
no.
of
what
i'm
about
to
say,
that
the
best
evidence
of
what
would
happen
after
the
merger
of
law
and
equity
is
what
did
happen
after
the
law...
merger
of
law
and
equity,
namely,
britain.
unknown
speaker
no.
but
there
must
be
some
objection
to
it
because,
i
mean,
at
the
moment
i
am
tempted,
which
you
will
say,
well,
let's
see
what
happens
after
law
and
equity.
what
did
they
do?
but...
but
are...
are
there
problems
with
it
carrying
that
over
here?
unknown
speaker
and
you
think
we
have
the
same
freedom
in
developing
new
rules
of
equity
as
the...
as
the
house
of
lords
does?
i
mean,
don't
forget
the
supreme
court
of
england
is
the
house
of
lords.
unknown
speaker
and
we
have
the
same...
we
have
the
same
authority
to...
to
revise
equitable--
unknown
speaker
--i
just
found
an
old
treatise
somewhere.
so,
this
is
why...
i'll
have
to
look
it
up,
but
i...
that
said
that
basically
you
could
get
an
injunction
to
prevent
a
fraudulent
conveyance.
and
probably
when
i
look
that
up,
i'll
discover,
because
you
would
have
had
it
otherwise,
that
it
isn't
really
in
point
or
something.
but...
but
i'm
not
sure.
what
was
the
reason
that
the...
the
courts
of
equity
wouldn't
enjoin,
say,
a
fraudulent
conveyance
where
the...
the
petitioner
in
equity
said,
i...
i
need
that
injunction
in
order
to
protect
my
sure-to-come
judgment
in
a
lawsuit.
unknown
speaker
what
was
the
reason?
was
it
anything
other
than--
unknown
speaker
--may
i
ask
you
to
comment
on
an
aspect
of
the
case
that
i
am
just
kind
of
puzzled
about?
if
i
understand
you
correctly,
it
is
unlikely
that
many
of
these
cases
would
arise
except
when
a
foreign
debtor
is...
is
in
the
picture.
and
if
it
were
true
that
under
the
laws
of
the...
of
mexico,
say,
where
you
have
certain
transactions
would
be
permitted
that
would
be
contrary
to
our
bankruptcy
rules
and
fraudulent
conveyances
under
our
rules,
is
it
clear
in
your
mind
that
a
district
court
should
be
able
to
enjoin
the
performance
of
action...
of
transactions
that
would
be
lawful
under
the
law
of
mexico
although
unlawful
here?
unknown
speaker
mr.
days,
i'm
a
little
concerned
about
your
taking
erie
out
of
the
picture
because
you
say
they
didn't
mention
it.
but
in
the
next
case,
i
mean,
we
sit
not
for
this
case
alone,
do
you
agree
that
the
way
the
game
would
be
played
is
you
look
to
see
if
rule
64
or
65
covers
it,
and
if
not,
then
you
look
to
see
what
new
york
does
and
then...
and
that
would
be
the
end
of
it?
unknown
speaker
but
rule
64
says
you
can...
you
can...
it's
a
permissive
rule.
you
could
do
what
the
state
makes
available.
unknown
speaker
rule
65,
at
least
mr.
mescon
tells
us,
is
a
how-to
rule.
it
doesn't
say
circumstances
in
which
you
can
get
injunctive
relief.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
thought
judge
mclaughlin,
who
knows
something
about
new
york
law,
said
new
york
law...
you
couldn't
get
this
in
new
york.
unknown
speaker
what
particular
provision
of
rule
65
is
it
that
you
think
is
substantive
rather
than
procedural?
unknown
speaker
i...
i
take
it
then--
unknown
speaker
--i
take
it
then
there
isn't
anything
in
the
rule
that--
unknown
speaker
--i
thought
none
of
the
rules
could
be--
unknown
speaker
--i
thought
none
of
the
rules
could
be
substantive,
because
didn't
congress
say
in
the
rules
enabling
act,
you
can't
do
things
that
affect
substantive
rights?
unknown
speaker
well,
you
would
probably
be
willing
to
hazard
this
far
at
least,
that
if...
if
the
state
in
question
under...
under
rule
64
did
not
permit
injunctions
at
all,
you
could
still
get
an
injunction
in
federal
court
by
reason
of
rule
65.
unknown
speaker
i'm...
yes.
unknown
speaker
no.
but
i'm
saying
suppose
a
state
did
not...
did
not
permit
injunction
at
all.
unknown
speaker
would
you
be
able
to
get
an
injunction
in
federal
court
by
reason
of
rule
65?
unknown
speaker
what...
what
do
you
think
rule
65
says
substantively
that
is
in
conflict
with
the
new
york
rule?
unknown
speaker
is
this...
you're
not
reading
from
the
rule.
unknown
speaker
well,
but
i
mean,
is
there
some
sentence
in
rule
65
you
can
point
to
that--
unknown
speaker
--well,
yes,
that
may
be,
but
i
think
it
would
have
to
be
derived
from
somewhere
other
than
rule
65.
it
wouldn't
include
whatever,
i
mean,
like,
you
know,
taking
his
mother
hostage
or
something
like
that.
equity
will
come
to
his
assistance
within...
within
the
bounds
of
what
equity
has
traditionally
done.
you're
not
saying
whatever
it
takes,
equity
can
do
it.
unknown
speaker
well,
but
that's
the
issue
before
us.
equity
hasn't
done
this
before.
so,
is...
is
this...
is
this
like
taking
your...
your
mother
hostage?
unknown
speaker
no,
probably
not.
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
this
wasn't,
you
know,
catch
me
if
you
can.
there's
no
contention
here
that...
that
there
was
fraud
going
on.
they...
they
just
wanted
to
do
something
that
was
convenient
for
the
sake
of
their
business.
i
mean--
unknown
speaker
--they
didn't
want
to
do
it
simply
in
order
to
avoid
paying
the
judgment
that
might
ensue
from
this.
they...
they
would
have
wanted
to
do
it
whether
this...
whether
this
case
was
pending
or
not,
wouldn't
they?
unknown
speaker
i
thought
that's
the
agreed
upon
state
of
matters.
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
just
a
technical
question
about
this,
what's...
what's
left
here.
unknown
speaker
we
have
a
permanent
injunction--
unknown
speaker
--and
the
possibility
of
a
suit
for
damages
against
the
bond.
is...
is
there
an
appeal
bond
still
in
existence?
unknown
speaker
thank
you,
mr.
days.
unknown
speaker
mr.
mescon,
you
have
3
minutes
remaining.
unknown
speaker
i
suppose
the
state
legislature
could
make
that
decision.
unknown
speaker
that
is,
you
don't
have--
unknown
speaker
--you
did...
i
got...
picked
that
up
from
what
you
said.
unknown
speaker
you
did
answer
the
question,
and
it
was
helpful.
unknown
speaker
if
we
ruled
for
you,
would
we
necessarily
be
disavowing
the
marcos
case,
or
are
there
distinctions
between
the
two
so
that
marcos
could
stand
and
you
could
still
prevail?
unknown
speaker
the
honorable
court
is
now
adjourned
until
monday
next
at
ten
o'clock.
