mr.
richard
a.
mescon
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
court
is
being
asked
today
to
ratify
a
significant
expansion
in
the
powers
of
the
federal
district
courts
to
issue
preliminary
injunctions.
this
it
should
not
do
for
two
reasons.
first,
there
is
no
historical
or
statutory
predicate
for
the
issuance
of
a
preliminary
injunction
to
restrain
the
disposition
of
the
assets
of
a
defendant
which
assets
are
unrelated
to
the
underlying
cause
of
action
and
are
located
outside
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court.
mr.
richard
a.
mescon
that
is
correct,
justice
o'connor.
mr.
richard
a.
mescon
that
is
correct.
mr.
richard
a.
mescon
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
a.
mescon
the--
mr.
richard
a.
mescon
--that
is
correct,
justice
o'connor.
mr.
richard
a.
mescon
the
issues
that
would...
that
your
honor
has
suggested
would
render
this
appeal
moot
arise
in
cases
where
the
issue
to
be
decided
on
the
merits
is
the
same
as
the
issue
to
be
decided
in
the
preliminary
injunction.
for
example,
in
camenisch,
which
is
the
case
relied
on
primarily
by
the
respondents,
the
claim
was
that
the
student
was
entitled
to
an
interpreter
under
section
504
of
the
rehabilitation
act.
the
injunction
was
granted.
the
case
came
to
this
court
before
the
case
had
been
decided
on
the
merits.
but
let's
assume
that
the
case
had
come
to
this
court
after
the
case
had
been
decided
on
the
merits.
clearly
if
the...
if
the
injunction
had
been
vacated,
the
state
would
have
had
a
remedy,
namely,
the
remedy
of
recouping
the
amount
of
money
it
had
paid
for
the
interpreter.
that
is
not
so
here
because
there
is
no
claim
in
this
case
that
the
permanent
injunction
was
improper.
there
is
no
claim
in
this
case
that
the
plaintiffs
did
not
have
a
probability
of
success
on
the
merits.
the
claim
in
this
case
is
as
to
the
power
of
the
court
to
issue
the
preliminary
injunction.
mr.
richard
a.
mescon
right,
that
under...
no.
the...
the
power
of
the
court...
the
absence
of
the
power
of
the
court
to
issue
a
preliminary
injunction
is
true
both
under
traditional
principles
of
equity
and
also
under
new
york
law.
mr.
richard
a.
mescon
justice
scalia,
if
i
could
prevail
on
proving
that
and
establishing
damages,
my
damages
would
be
the
loss
to
gmd
for
the
inability
to
restructure
its
debt,
conduct
its
business,
and
organize
its
affairs
during
the
4
months
of
the
pendency
of
the
preliminary
injunction,
which
damages--
mr.
richard
a.
mescon
--no.
if
absent
the
preliminary
injunction--
mr.
richard
a.
mescon
--no.
the
final
injunction
says
that
when
one
has
a
judgment,
one
can
restrain
the
assets
of
the
debtor.
the
very
point
in
this
case
is
that
before
there
is
a
final
judgment,
before
there
is
a
permanent
injunction,
there
is
no
power
in
the
court
to
restrain
the
assets
of
the
debtor
unrelated
to
the
underlying--
mr.
richard
a.
mescon
--that
is
correct,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
richard
a.
mescon
we
would...
we
have
not
yet
proved
that.
mr.
richard
a.
mescon
yes,
justice
kennedy.
mr.
richard
a.
mescon
that
is
correct.
at
any
moment
until
april
17th,
197...
1998,
when
judge
martin
issued
that
permanent
injunction,
gmd
was
free
to
do
with
its
assets
whatever
it
wished
to
do.
mr.
richard
a.
mescon
justice
ginsburg,
you're
correct.
he
did
give
us
an
opportunity
to
come
and
make
an
application
for
leave
to
make
expenses,
if
you
will,
in
the
ordinary
course
of
business.
but
what
the
company,
which
was
clearly
in
significant
financial
straights,
where
it
remains
today,
wanted
to
do
is
effect
a
restructuring
of
its
debts,
not
merely
to
pay
its
current
obligations
as
they
were
due,
wanted
to
make,
if
you
will,
preferential
payments
perhaps,
preferential
under
our
bankruptcy
code.
mr.
richard
a.
mescon
pardon
me?
mr.
richard
a.
mescon
parties
other
than
this
plaintiff.
mr.
richard
a.
mescon
i
would
only
quibble
with
one
part
of
your
comment,
justice
ginsburg.
we
wanted
to
deal
with
these...
these
assets
not
so
there
would
be
nothing
available,
but
rather
with
the
effect
that
there
would
be
nothing
available.
the
purpose
was
not
to
eliminate
assets
available
for
these
plaintiffs,
but
that
would
have
been
the
effect
of
the
action.
with
that
qualification,
i
agree
with
your
honor's
observation.
mr.
richard
a.
mescon
it's
a
week
less
than
4
months,
justice
ginsburg.
mr.
richard
a.
mescon
right.
there
actually
have
been
statutes
like
that
at
different
times
in...
in
our
country.
there
was
a
statute
in
mississippi
in
the
late
19th
century
that...
that
had
something
of
that
same
content
that
was
before
this
court
in
scott
v.
neely.
in
those
swift
v.
tyson
days,
this
court
said
we're
not
going
to
apply
the
mississippi
state
rule.
we're
going
to
apply
the
basic
federal
equitable
rule
which
is
no
injunction
shall...
shall
be
issued.
mr.
richard
a.
mescon
but
nowadays,
after
erie
against
tompkins,
my
answer
to
your
question
would
be
if
a
new
york
statute
afforded
this
right
to
the
plaintiffs
in
a
diversity
action
in
new
york,
they
would
have
this
right.
mr.
richard
a.
mescon
that
is
correct.
first
of
all--
mr.
richard
a.
mescon
--yes.
we
have
the...
we
have
the
benefit
of...
of
judge
mclaughlin's
insights
into
what
new
york
law
provides.
we
have
an
explicit
finding
by
the
court
of
appeals
as
to
what
new
york
law
is
and
new
york
law
does
not
permit
such
an
injunction.
mr.
richard
a.
mescon
yes.
yes,
justice
kennedy.
i
would
say
that
this
case
and
a
diversity
case
is
governed
by
erie,
and
for
that
reason,
we
must
look
to
new
york
state
law.
new
york
state
law
provides
that
such
an
injunction
cannot
be
issued
in
the
new
york
state
courts,
and
the
old
across-the-street
argument
applies.
we
shouldn't
be
able
to
do
it--
mr.
richard
a.
mescon
--not
so.
if
the
rule--
mr.
richard
a.
mescon
--if
under
hanna...
if
we...
if
rule
65
were
amended
so
as
to
give
the
federal
courts
this
authority,
then
in
my
view
this
would
be
within
the
rules
enabling
act.
it
would
be
a
proper
exercise
of
congressional
or
court
rulemaking
authority,
and
therefore
that
would
also,
if
you
will,
trump
state
law
as...
as
in
hanna,
the
service
requirement--
mr.
richard
a.
mescon
--that
is
correct.
rule
65
does
not
authorize
what
was
done
here
because
rule
65
is...
is
a...
is
a
mechanism,
is
a
cookbook,
is
a
recipe
of
how
to
get
one.
it
doesn't...
it
doesn't
talk
about
substantive
bases
for
a
preliminary
injunction.
cases
like
sims
snowboard
in
the
ninth
circuit
and
the
decision
by
justice...
by
judge
clark
in
frankie
v.
wilchek
in
the
second
circuit
suggest,
though
this
court
hasn't
decided
it,
that
the
question
for...
of
whether
a
preliminary
injunction
is
procedural
or
substantive
under
erie
is
that
it
is
substantive.
mr.
richard
a.
mescon
a
and
b
are
both
in
new
york
and
the
property
is
in
new
jersey?
mr.
richard
a.
mescon
an
action
could
be
commenced
in
new
jersey
and
assuming
the
new
jersey
attachment
statute--
mr.
richard
a.
mescon
--right.
or
in
mexico.
mr.
richard
a.
mescon
yes,
justice
breyer,
but
a
route
that
is
not
sanctioned
by
the
traditional
equity
jurisprudence--
mr.
richard
a.
mescon
--i
don't
think
that
the
new
york
courts
would
issue
such
an
injunction.
mr.
richard
a.
mescon
yes,
by
going
to
new
jersey
and
getting
an
attachment.
mr.
richard
a.
mescon
well,
with
regard
to
attachment
certainly--
mr.
richard
a.
mescon
--because
rule
64
says
that
you
look
to
state
for
attachment.
for
rule
65,
you
don't
do
it
because
the
court
can't
do
it.
it
doesn't
have
the...
the
courts
don't
have
the
power
to
exercise...
to
issue
injunctions
with
regard
to
restraining
assets...
restraining
assets
and
actions
for
money
damages.
mr.
richard
a.
mescon
of
course.
mr.
richard
a.
mescon
yes,
justice
scalia.
mr.
richard
a.
mescon
but...
but
certainly
in
an
equitable
action,
they
do
have
that
power.
mr.
richard
a.
mescon
and
that's
what
the...
the
decisions
in
this
court
in
deckert
and
first
national
city
bank
have
said.
mr.
richard
a.
mescon
if
this
were
an
action
for
a
fraudulent
conveyance,
it
would
depend
on
an
analysis
of
the
equitable
principle
of
whether
or
not
the
plaintiff
had
a
sufficiently
connected
interest
in
the
object,
in
the
subject
of
the
claim
to
justify
the...
the
issuance
of
an
injunction,
very
fact-specific.
there
are
cases...
a
good
example
really
is...
even
in
first
national
city
bank,
the
question
is
how
attenuated,
how
close
is
the
relationship
between
plaintiff's
claim
and
the
object
in
question
i
could
conceive
of
a
case
where
that
relationship
was
significantly
close,
that
the
plaintiff's
interest
in
the
thing
to
be
enjoined
would
justify
the
issuance
of
an
injunction.
i
can
think
of
many
cases,
routine
money
damages
cases,
like
actions
on
a
note,
for
example,
as
was
here,
where
that
connection
would
not
be
so
close.
and
so,
i--
mr.
richard
a.
mescon
--it
is
clear
from
this
court's
holding
that
a
state's
power
to
attach
assets
is
limited
to
assets
within
its
own
jurisdiction.
so,
with
regard
to
attachment,
new
york
could
not
attach
assets
outside
of
the
state.
mr.
richard
a.
mescon
well,
which
notes
are
we
talking
about?
mr.
richard
a.
mescon
well,
there
are
the
notes
that
were
issued
by
the
defendant
to
the
plaintiff,
and
there
are
also
those
notes
that
the
mexican--
mr.
richard
a.
mescon
--they
have...
they
are
to
receive.
they
have
not
yet
been
received.
mr.
richard
a.
mescon
the
case
would
have
been
very
different
if
they
had
been
encased
in
a
safe
deposit
box--
mr.
richard
a.
mescon
--well,
it
might
be.
where
the...
it
depends
i
suppose
on
the
nature
of
where
it
is
located.
if
they
were
negotiable
instruments
and
they
were
located
in
new
york,
i
think
under
the
attachment--
mr.
richard
a.
mescon
--yes,
justice
scalia.
mr.
richard
a.
mescon
right.
i'm
with
you.
mr.
richard
a.
mescon
with
regard
to
attachment,
the
power
of
the
new
york
state
courts
is
limited.
they
cannot--
mr.
richard
a.
mescon
--but
in
personam,
the
authority
of
the
new
york
state
courts
is
just
as
broad
as
the
authority
of
the
federal
district
court.
mr.
richard
a.
mescon
with
regard
to
assets
outside
their
jurisdiction,
but
the...
the
basis
of
judge
martin's
ruling
was
that
he
had
in
personam
jurisdiction...
and
this
is
indeed
the
basis
in
part
of
the
first
national
city
bank
holding...
in
personam
jurisdiction
over
the
defendant,
and
therefore,
based
on
that
in
personam
jurisdiction,
could
enjoin
conduct
worldwide.
and
the
federal
district
court
is
no
more
powerful
than
the
new
york
state
supreme
court
with
respect
to
that
power.
the...
this
principle
in
new
york
state
law
goes
back
very,
very
far.
the
legislative
history
is...
is
not
clear
as
to
the
origins,
except
that
it
stems
back
from
traditional
pre-1789
notions
of
what
were
the
powers
of
the
court
in
equity
that
were
adopted
as
part
of
our...
the
first
judiciary
act
when
we
adopted
the
equitable
power
and
when
we
gave
to
the
federal
district
courts
only
those
powers
in
equity
which
the
english
courts
in
chancery
had
in
1789.
mr.
richard
a.
mescon
that's
correct.
mr.
richard
a.
mescon
right.
no.
i
was...
i'm
sorry.
i
was
just
answering
why
i
thought
new
york
had
the
policy.
i
don't
know
what
the
policy
of
new
york
state
was.
i
was
surmising
that
it
might
have
flowed
from
this
traditional
equitable
notion
that
would
have
been
as
obvious
to
the
new
york
state
legislature
as
to
anyone
else
that
courts
don't
have
powers
to
issue
preliminary
injunctions
to
restrain
assets
to
satisfy
a
money
judgment
before
judgment.
mr.
richard
a.
mescon
mareva,
justice
kennedy.
mr.
richard
a.
mescon
with
the
greatest
respect
and
with
some
trepidation,
this
court
would
not
have
the
power
to
do
that
except
perhaps
by
exercising
its
authority
under
the
rules
enabling
act
to
promulgate
rules
of
civil
procedure.
but
acting
as
a
court,
bound
by
the
precedents
about
what
the...
what
courts
of
equity
can
do,
and
guided
by
the
principles
of
erie
and
with
reference
to
new
york
state
law,
this
court
could
not
do
that.
mr.
richard
a.
mescon
well,
first--
mr.
richard
a.
mescon
--assets
out
of
state
are...
are
not
something
new
that's
a
function
of
the
new
global
economy.
in
the
sense,
of
course,
of
power,
i
suppose
the
answer
to
your
honor's
question
is
yes,
the
court
could
do
that.
no
one
could
tell
the
court
not
to
do
it,
but
i
don't
think
it
would
be
appropriate
exercise
of
the
court's
power
for
the
court
to
do
it
perhaps
would
be
a
better
way
to
say
it.
mr.
richard
a.
mescon
because
of--
mr.
richard
a.
mescon
--that
and
the
erie
doctrine.
mr.
richard
a.
mescon
no,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
richard
a.
mescon
it
is
because
the
law
of
new
york
state
makes
plain,
as
judge
mclaughlin
described
in
his
opinion
below,
that
injunctions
to
secure
funds
for
payments
of
money
damages
not
in
an
equitable
claim
are
not
permitted
by
the
courts
of
the
state
of
new
york.
mr.
richard
a.
mescon
that
could
be
one
reason.
it
is
clear
that
attachments
apply
to
property
in
state.
it
really
goes
back
to
justice
ginsburg's
question,
why
new
york
state
doesn't
afford
this
remedy.
perhaps
because
they
think
attachment
is
enough,
perhaps
because
their
guided
by
the
same
principles
of
the
chancery
court
that
have
guided
the
federal
courts
up
until
1986
when
the
first
of
these
decisions
was
made.
mr.
richard
a.
mescon
that's
correct.
mr.
richard
a.
mescon
in
a
case
in
which
the...
i
do
not
know
the
answer
to
that
question.
but
the...
in
a
case
in
which
the
issue
raised
by
the
preliminary
injunction
goes
to
the
power
of
the
court
and
is
not
at
all
dependent
upon
the
merits
of
the
case,
then
the
entire
rationale,
which
is
a
sensible
rationale,
for
not
deciding
the
preliminary
injunction,
after
it's
merged
with
a
permanent
injunction,
does
not
apply.
mr.
richard
a.
mescon
i...
i
would
like
to
adopt
your
position,
mr.
chief
justice,
but
i
think
some
of
the
authorities
cited
by
the
respondent
would
limit
our
ability
to...
to
recover
in
such
a
case
if
the
issue,
for
example,
in...
if
the
issue
were
the
same
as
the
issue
decided
at
the
preliminary
injunction.
mr.
richard
a.
mescon
the
judge,
for
example,
deciding
the
preliminary
injunction...
there
wasn't
enough
evidence
in
the
record
for
him
to
make
an
appropriate
finding
of--
mr.
richard
a.
mescon
--but
he
guessed
right,
yes,
justice
scalia.
then
he's
validated,
if
you
will,
by
the
final
decision.
and
i
think
that's
what
the
cases
cited
by
respondent
stand
for
and
we
don't
dispute
that--
mr.
richard
a.
mescon
--yes.
under
new
york
law
5222
of
the
cplr,
which
rule
69
makes
applicable
in
the
federal
courts,
there
is
an
absolute
right
in
the
court
to
enjoin
a
debtor
from
parting
with
any
asset
of
any
kind
after
there's
a
judgment
until
the
judgment
is
satisfied.
and
we...
while
initial
notice
of
appeal
from
the
final
judgment
did
contest
that,
because
the
notice
of
appeal
was
filed
within
a
couple
of
days
of
the
final
judgment,
when
we
drafted
our
brief
on
the
merits
for
that
second
appeal
from
the
final
judgment,
we
withdrew
that
claim
because
that
injunction
was
proper
and
was
permitted
under
new
york
law,
which
under
rule
69
is
applied
in
the
district
court.
mr.
richard
a.
mescon
i
believe
they
are
not
issued--
mr.
richard
a.
mescon
--justice
breyer,
because...
because
if
the
action
between
a
and
b
is
unrelated
to
the
asset--
mr.
richard
a.
mescon
--then
i
believe
that...
that
is
exactly,
you
know,
lister
v.
stubbs
was
just
such
a
case.
you
know,
the...
the
classic
situation
in
which...
with
the
exception
of
mississippi
in
the
late
19th
century,
we
don't
enjoin
fraudulent
conveyances.
the
federal
rule
up
till
1986
was
that
in
that
case,
as...
as
unpleasant
as
it
may
have
been,
you
have
to
go
to
new
jersey
to
get
your
injunction
where
there
can
be
an
attachment
of
the
assets.
mr.
richard
a.
mescon
no,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
richard
a.
mescon
the
trial...
there
was
a
motion
for
summary
judgment.
there
was--
mr.
richard
a.
mescon
--the...
the...
there
was
a
period
of
several
weeks
of
briefing,
and
i
think
the
matter
was
sub
judice
for
something
on
the
order
of
a
week.
but
i--
mr.
richard
a.
mescon
--right,
justice
stevens.
and
that...
that
point
is
really
i
think
what
motivated
the
trial
judge.
he
said
to
me
could
i
do
this
after
judgment,
and
i
said,
yes,
judge
martin,
you
could
do
it
after
judgment.
and
he
said,
well,
i
am
sure
that
the
plaintiffs
are
going
to
win
this
case,
and
if
i
could
do
it
after
judgment,
i
can
do
it
now.
and
that
tests
the
principle
that
we're
raising.
that
really
is
where
the
rubber
meets
the
road.
but
the
point
is,
within
the
limits
of
due
process,
he
could
have
truncated
it
as
far
as
he
wanted
to,
but
for
whatever
period--
mr.
richard
a.
mescon
--if...
if
he...
within
the
limits
of
due
process--
mr.
richard
a.
mescon
--if
he
had
accelerated
the
trial
and
had
somehow
a
finding
on
the
merits
within
a
day
or
2
of
the...
of
the
original
ex
parte
application,
then...
then
the
answer
is
yes.
mr.
richard
a.
mescon
but
that
was
always...
there's
nothing
new
about
that,
justice
breyer.
mr.
richard
a.
mescon
that's
correct.
mr.
chief
justice,
if
there
are
no
other
questions,
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
balance--
mr.
richard
a.
mescon
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
several
short
points.
on
the
question
of
whether
mareva
injunctions
are
a
good
idea
or
a
bad
idea,
there's
been
a
lot
written.
it's
referred
to
in
the
briefs.
the
question
of
how
it
would
implicate
our
bankruptcy
statutes,
the
question
of
how
it
would
implicate
the
relationships
between
debtors
and
creditors,
the
question
of
how
it
would
implicate
our
relations
with
other
nations
are
all
important,
interesting
questions
that
suggest
that
mareva
injunctions
would
not
be
a
good
idea.
but
in
any
event,
whether
they
are
or
whether
they
are
not,
it
is
for
the
congress
to
decide
whether
or
not
that
is
an
appropriate
extension
of
the
judicial
power
in
the
united
states
because
the
lower
federal
courts
in
this
country--
mr.
richard
a.
mescon
--and
the
state
legislatures
could
do
that
as
well,
yes,
justice
stevens.
second,
the
complaint
in
this
case
did
not
request
any
kind
of
establishment
of
a
trust.
there
was
a
motion
made,
a
preliminary
injunction
motion,
that
called
for
the
creation
of
a
trust,
but
that
was
not
part
of
the
permanent
relief.
and
finally,
justice
breyer,
if
i
could
turn
to
your
question
and
make
my
third
attempt
to
try
to
answer
it.
i
hope
this
will
be
helpful.
first,
in
this
case
there
was
no
allegation
of
a
fraudulent
conveyance.
i
start
by
saying
that.
all
of
the
transfers
were
made
in
consideration
of
valid
debts,
frequently
at
a
discount
and
so
on.
but
i
think
the
cases
that
your
honor
may
be
thinking
of
relate
to
those
in
which
the
plaintiff
had
some
interest,
some
traceable
interest.
i
think
the
phrase
in
the
old
cases
sometimes--
mr.
richard
a.
mescon
--is
follow
the
money.
mr.
richard
a.
mescon
okay,
fine.
mr.
richard
a.
mescon
and
finally,
with
regard
to
the
question
of
the
merger
of
law
and
equity,
it
is
correct
cases
like
stainback
and
gordon
made
clear
that
the
merger
of
law
and
equity
have
made
no
fundamental
difference
on
the
powers
of
this
court
acting
as
a
court--
mr.
richard
a.
mescon
--i
cannot
find
the
principal
distinction
between
our
case
and...
the
marcos
case
cries
out
for
something
because
the
facts
are
very
bad
and
the
facts
here
are
much
more
favorable
to...
to
our
client,
which
makes
this
a...
a
better
case
from
our
side
of
the
table.
but
it's
hard
to
think
of
a
principled
reason
why
the
courts
could
do
that.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
thank
you
very
much.
