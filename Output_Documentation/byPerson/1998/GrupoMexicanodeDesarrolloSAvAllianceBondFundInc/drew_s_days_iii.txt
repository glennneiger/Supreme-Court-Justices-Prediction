mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
wanted
to
address
some
of
the
issues
that
were
just
raised
with
my
opposing
counsel
on
the
mootness
issue
and
with
respect
to
the
erie
issue
as
well.
first
of
all,
on
the
question
of
the
applicability
of
camenisch,
we
believe
that
camenisch
makes
very
clear
that
the
issue
of
the
ability
to
sue
for
damages
on
the
bond
is
not
a
matter
that
can
be
resolved
on
an
interlocutory
appeal
of
a
preliminary
injunction.
of
course,
there
is
no
preliminary
injunction
in
existence
at
this
point.
it
ceased
to
exist
when
it
was
converted
to
a
permanent
injunction
by
the
district
judge.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
i
understand
that,
justice
kennedy,
but
i
think
that
what--
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
--that
is
correct.
it's
not
directly
on
point
in
that
regard,
but
i
think
it
can
be
used
for
this
purpose.
in
camenisch,
it
is
true
that
there
was
the
question
of
the
ability
to
recover
on
the...
on
the
injunction
bond,
and
what
this
court
said
was
that
issue
can
be
resolved
after
a
trial
on
the
merits
and
final
judgment.
there
was
a...
a
nexus
between
those
two.
what
gmd
argues
here
is
that
there
is
no
nexus.
there's
no
nexus
between
the
preliminary
injunction
and
the
merit
issue
in
this
case,
and
we
disagree
with
that.
we
think
that
the
permanent
injunction
was
in
fact
just
an
extension
of
the
preliminary
injunction.
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
that
suggests
that
the
judge
relied
on
any
different
authority
for
the
permanent
injunction
than
he
invoked
when
he
entered
the
preliminary
injunction.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
mr.
chief
justice,
with...
with
respect,
this
court
has
said
that
where
one
wants
to
have
those
types
of
issues
resolved,
they
have
to
be
resolved
after
trial
on
the
merits
and
judgment.
any...
any
person
who's
been--
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
--well,
i
think,
mr.
chief
justice,
but
what
the
district
judge,
in
essence,
found
was
that
the
activities
of
gmd
that
were
preliminarily
enjoined
were
correctly
enjoined,
and
that's
what
the
permanent
injunction
is
all
about.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
yes,
i
think
that
is
certainly
possible,
mr.
chief
justice,
but
what
it
opens
up
is
the
ability
of
any
party
who's
been
dissatisfied
with
a
ruling
on
a
preliminary
injunction
to
raise
not
just
the
basic
propriety
of
the
issuance
of
the
preliminary
injunction,
namely,
whether
it
met
the
basic
requirements
of
rule
65,
but
larger
issues,
or
even
issues
as
to
do
with
whether
there
was
irreparable
harm.
but
i
think
this
court
has
said
that
those
issues
simply
are
inappropriately
raised
with
respect
to
a
preliminary
injunction.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
yes.
i...
i
understand
that
to
be
the
argument.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
yes.
let
me
just
mention
one
other
factor
with
respect
to
the
bond
damage
action,
and
that
is,
as
was
pointed
out
i
think
by
justice
ginsburg,
the
district
judge
here
allowed
gmd
to
come
in
and
seek
modifications
from
the
preliminary
injunction.
gmd
initially
filed
such
a
petition
for...
or
motion
for
modification
and
withdrew
it.
so,
i
think
that
one
of
the
things
that's
presented
here
is
the
highly
hypothetical
nature
of
the
claim
on...
on
the
bond.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
yes,
mr.
chief
justice.
let
me
turn,
if
i
may,
to
the
erie
question.
as
we've
indicated
in
our
brief,
we
think
that
the
erie
issue
is
not
properly
before
this
court.
it
was
not
fairly
included
in
the
question
presented,
nor
was
it
pressed
or
passed
on
in
the
lower
courts.
i
think
the
colloquy
between
the
court
and
mr.
mescon
reflect
the
fact
that
what
gmd
is
asking
this
court
to
do
is
the
work
of
the
lower
court
judges,
that
is,
the
trial
judge
and
the
court
of
appeals.
now,
they
have
pointed
to
a
decision
by
the
second
circuit
in
this
case
in
which
the
court
says
all
parties
agree
that
this
type
of
relief
would
not
be
available
under
rule
64
or
new
york
injunction
law.
first
of
all,
that
entire
discussion
in
the
lower
courts
was
about
the
relationship
between
rule
64
and
65.
erie
never
came
up,
and
i
think
one
would
search
in
vain
to
find
even
the
word
erie
mentioned
in
any
of
the
filings
in
this
court
below
until
this
court
got
the
merits
brief
from
gmd
in
this
case.
and
secondly...
and
i
know
it's
somewhat
curious
that
the
court
says
rule
64
and
the
injunction
statute,
but
what
it
was
saying
was
that
under
new
york
law,
if
one
brings
an
attachment
action
pursuant
to
rule
64,
one
can
also
get
an
injunction
in
aid
of
that
attachment
process.
so,
i
think
that
it
is
unfair
to
look
at
that
decision
as
a
pronouncement
on
what
new
york
law
would,
in
fact,
hold
if
those
courts
had
been
invited
to
consider
erie
and
go
through
the
process
that
you
were
discussing
with
mr.
mescon.
let
me
turn
to
the
basic
issue
here,
though.
i
think
mr.
mescon
has
been
very
direct
and
very
candid
in
saying
that
there's
no
historical
or
statutory
predicate
for
what
the
district
judge
did
here,
and
indeed,
that
this
court
has
no
power
to
authorize
a
federal
judge
to
do
what
judge
martin
did
here.
i
am
reminded
of
a
quotation
from
justice
holmes
in
which
he
said
that
it
is
revolting
to
have
no
better
reason
for
a
rule
of
law
than
that's
what
was
laid
down
in
the
time
of
henry
iv.
it
is
still
more
revolting
if
the
grounds
upon
which
it
was
laid
down
have
vanished
long
since,
and
the
rule
simply
persists
from
blind
imitation
of
the
past.
now,
i
don't
necessarily
want
to
embrace
the
revolting
part
of
that
statement
by
mr.
justice
holmes,
but
i
think
it
does
get
to
the
heart
of
this.
what
basically
gmd
is
saying
is
that
there
were
cases
in
the
19th
century
where
parties
sought
to
get
freeze
orders
and
were
told
that
they
were
unable
to
do
that,
that
the
court
simply
could
not
provide
that
type
of
relief.
scott
v.
neely,
the
hollins
case,
and
there
are
other
cases
that
go
to
the
same
point.
but
those
were
pre-merger
cases,
and
i
think
that
if
one
thinks
about
them
in
terms
of
their
being
pre-merger,
when
courts
were
faced
first,
as
was
true
in
those
cases,
with
a
request
for
a
final
judgment
that
included
the
freeze
order,
that
is,
a
freeze
order
that
would
take
the
defendants
property
and
convert
it
in
a
way
that
would
satisfy
a
money
judgment
that
the
plaintiffs
were
seeking--
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
--i
think,
mr.
chief
justice,
what
the
merger
did
was
allow
a
court,
sitting
on
both
law
and
equity
cases,
to
use
remedies
that
previously
would
have
been
available
only
in
a
court
of
equity
after
there
had
been
some
satisfaction
of
a
judgment
in...
on
the
law
side
of
the
court.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
well,
i
think...
i
think
that
certainly
if
the
law
had
been
clear
in
that
respect,
the
courts
had
been
very
clear
that
no
matter
what
the
circumstances,
no
matter
what
the
merger,
no
matter
what
happened
to
the
seventh
amendment
rights
that
were
always
implicated
in
that
type
of
situation,
then
we'd
have
a
different...
different
problem.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
we
do
not
have
a
case
that
deals
specifically
with
this
question,
but
i
think
the...
this
court
in...
in
dairy
queen
v.
wood
pointed
out
the
kind
of
time-bound
nature
of
decisions
like
scott
v.
neely.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
justice
scalia,
i
think
that
what
rule
65
does
is
embody
all
of
the
principles
of
equity
power,
and
i
don't
think
those
decisions
that
have
been
cited
by...
by
gmd
stand
for
the
proposition
that
they
would
absolutely
have
been
foreclosed
after
a
merger
of
law
and
equity.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
well,
i
think
that
the
fact
that
there
haven't
been
many
of
these
cases
arising
is
reflective
of
the
fact
that
in
most
instances
we
don't
have
the
unique
circumstances
presented
in
this
case.
we
have
a
situation
where
there
is
a
party
that
admitted
that
it
was
subject
to
the
personal
jurisdiction
of
the
court
and
to
the
laws
of
not
only
new
york
state,
but
of
the
federal
court's
laws,
whatever
they
might
apply.
it
was
a
situation
where
there
were
no
assets
in
the
jurisdiction.
therefore,
attachment
was
unavailable.
bankruptcy
was
not
available
because
it's
a
foreign
corporation
and
would
not
be
subject
to
the
bankruptcy
laws.
and
one
can
go
down
the
list.
under
those
circumstances,
what
we
believe
is
the
case,
that
if
one
looks
at
the
nature
of
equity,
the
flexibility
and
the
adapting
to
new
circumstances
that
has
always
characterized
the
equity
power
of
federal
courts,
that
it
is
not
inappropriate
for
the
equity
court
in
1999
to
try
to
deal
with
this
situation.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
no.
i'm
simply
saying
that
it
goes
to
the
whole
question
of
whether,
for
example,
there's
an
adequate
remedy
at
law,
whether
there's
irreparable
harm.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
i'll
accept
it
then,
mr.
justice
kennedy.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
yes.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
yes,
that
is
correct.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
i
think
it's
a
very
persuasive
argument.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
well,
i...
i
won't...
i
don't
want
to
go
to
the
point
of
seeing
this
as
merely
a
gap-filling
procedure.
it
is
a
procedure
in
which
a
federal
court
is
presented
with
a
party
and
it
is
told,
as
mr.
mescon
has
told
this
court,
you
are
completely
powerless,
no
matter
what
the
circumstance
is,
no
matter
what
can
be
shown
about
irreparable
harm,
the
inadequacy
of
legal
remedies,
the
unavailability
of
attachment,
the
unavailability
of
bankruptcy,
you
have--
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
--nothing
that
can
be
done.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
well,
i
don't
think
it's
a
sweeping
change.
i
think
it
merely
is
a
situation
where,
as
this
case
reflects,
all
of
the
tools
that
would
ordinarily
be
available
to
a
litigant
in
the
courts
of
this
country
are
not
available
to
the
investors
in
this
case
because
of
the
circumstances
that
i've
just
described.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
what
is
the
objection
to...
to
this
approach?
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
yes,
that
is
correct.
i
think
in
mareva--
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
--i'm
not
prepared
to
say
that
there
would
be
a
wholesale
transporting
of
the
mareva
injunction
approach
to
the
united
states,
but
i
think
it
does
say
two
important
things.
one
is
that
the
english
courts
are
drawing
from
the
same
historical
base
that
our
courts
are
drawing
from
in
terms
of
the
nature
of
equity
court
power.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
i
understand
that,
justice
scalia.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
i
think
what
it
says
is
that
to
the
extent
that
this
court
has
held
and
it's
held
for
a
number
of
years
that,
as
long
as
federal
courts
are
applying
principles
of
equity
that
were
handed
to
the
courts
in
1789
in
the
first
judiciary
act,
then
they
can
continue
to
do
that
and
they
can
determine--
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
--yes.
justice
breyer--
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
--i...
i
think
the
reasons
aren't
given.
they
simply
were
pronounced.
if
one
looks
at
those
cases,
first
of
all,
there's
no
discussion
of
irreparable
harm.
there
is
a
clear
concern
about
the
problem
of
depriving
a
litigant
of
a
jury
trial
right
under
the
seventh
amendment.
and
as
dairy
queen
v.
wood
says,
those
issues
have
been
done
away
with.
they're
no
longer
problematic.
now,
the
court
doesn't
go
on
to
say
what
follows
from
that,
but
we
think
what
follows
naturally
from
this
is
the
power
that
the
district
court
exercised
in
this
particular
case.
the
second
point
i
want
to
make
about
mareva,
however,
is
that
the...
the
courts
have
been
able
to
apply
that
principle
in
a
way
that
has
not
caused
a
floodgate
to
open
up.
they
have
used
it
very
carefully
and
cautiously,
and
we
think
that
under
rule
65
and
the
demanding
standards
under
rule
65,
there's
no
reason
why
federal
courts
shouldn't
do
the
same.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
justice
stevens,
that's
obviously
an
issue
that
a
trial
judge,
a
federal
trial
judge,
would
have
to
consider
very
carefully.
i
think
that
if
that
judge
had
power...
personal
jurisdiction
over
the
defendants
before
it,
that
judge
could
issue
an
order
that
would
have
extraterritorial
effect
requiring
those
defendants
to
do
one
thing
or
another.
that's
been
part
of
our
law
for
many,
many
years.
but
i
think
what
the
judge
did
here
is
an
example
of
caution
under
such
circumstances.
for
one
thing,
he
did
not
try
to
affect
anything
in
mexico
as
such
with
respect
to
insolvency
proceedings.
what
he
said
was,
you
may
take
advantage
of
whatever
insolvency
proceedings
or
rights
are
available
to
you
in
mexico.
gmd
simply
never
availed...
insofar
as
i'm
aware,
availed
itself
of
that
possibility.
it
also
made
clear
that
it
went
directly
against
the
defendants
and
their
privies
not
third
parties,
and
that's
been
true
under
the
mareva
injunctions
as
well.
there's
something
called
a
babanaft
proviso
which
makes
very
clear
that
when
a...
a
worldwide
mareva
injunction
is
issued
by
an
english
court,
it's
very
limited
so
that
it
does
not
unwittingly
or,
indeed,
intentionally
affect
proceedings
in
a
foreign
country.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
well,
that's
correct,
justice
ginsburg.
but
i...
the
point
i
was
making
or
should
have
made
is
that
if
one
looks
at
this
case
and
looks
at
every
other
case
on
this
particular
question
of
the
power
of
federal
judges
to
issue
a
freeze
order,
one
will
look
in
vain
in
those
cases
as
well
for
a
discussion
of
erie.
the
debate
has
been
over
rule
65
versus
rule
64.
that
doesn't
mean
that
this
court
shouldn't
get
to
the
erie
issue,
but
we
thought
it
was
incumbent
us
to
point
out
that
there
were
some,
shall
we
say,
missing
of
compliance
with
the
rules
of
this
court
on
that...
in
that
regard.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
yes.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
yes.
well,
mr.
mescon
would...
would
have
rule
65
be
viewed
as
an
empty
vessel,
but
as
we've
indicated,
it
is
really
the
embodiment
of
the
principles
of
equity
that
have
been
in
effect
for
over
200
years.
and
in
the
erie
analysis,
we
would
say
several
things.
first,
as
we've
indicated
in
our
brief,
there
is
no
conflict
between
federal
law
and
new
york
law.
now,
once
again,
this
court
is
going
to
have
to
resolve
that
issue
because
there's
no
guidance
in
the
opinions
of
the
lower
court,
but--
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
--well,
justice
ginsburg,
as
i
indicated
earlier,
i
don't
think
that
that
particular
comment
can
be
read
for
the
proposition
that
gmd
invokes
it
for.
it
simply
does
not
go
to
that
lengths.
it's
about
rule
64.
it
says
nothing
about
what
would
happen
under
rule
65.
and,
indeed,
we've
mentioned
the
zonghetti
case,
for
example,
under
new
york
law,
and
it
depends
upon
what
level
one
wants
to
look
at
in
interpreting
new
york
law.
and
we
have
no
definitive
decision
in
that
respect
in
this
case.
but
let
me
go
beyond
that
and
say
that
we
think
that
rule
65
does
control
here,
that
there
is...
if
it's
contrary
to
new
york
law,
there's
a
direct
collision.
and
hanna
v.
plumer
says
that
under
those
circumstances--
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
--well,
your
honor,
i...
it
is
not
a
question
of
whether
it
says
explicitly
that
the
rules
of
equity
must
apply,
but
what...
as
we've
indicated
in
our
brief,
rule
65
is
a
result
of
a
development
from--
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
--1789.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
that
is
correct.
this
court
has
not
decided
whether
rule
65
is
procedural
or
substantive
for
erie
analysis.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
well,
that
is...
that
is
correct,
certainly,
justice
ginsburg.
but
i
think
that
what
this
court
has
held
is
that
when
a
matter
is
procedural,
then...
and
it's
expressed
in
federal
law
and
there's
a
direct
collision
between
this
federal
procedural
rule
and
whatever
the
state
rule
may
be,
then
the
federal
rule
controls.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
well,
in
fact,
rule...
under
64--
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
--yes.
new
york
does
permit
injunctions
is
what
i'm
saying.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
yes.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
i
would
say
yes,
your
honor,
because
as
this
court
has
indicated,
it
tries
to
get...
and
justice
ginsburg's
questions
i
think
got
to
this
point.
what
is
the
state
interest?
well,
we
don't
know
what
the
state
interest
here
assuming
that
the...
the
defendants
are
right,
gmd
is
right,
about
new
york
law.
but
i
think
that
we've
set
out
in
our
brief
an
indication
that
there
are
several
layers
of
new
york
law,
and
for
example,
where
there's
a
showing
of
irreparable
harm
or
possibility
of
insolvency,
new
york's
courts
do
allow
for
this
type
of
injunctive
relief.
but
we
think
that
rule
65
is
directly
in
conflict
with
what
gmd
asserts
is
the
new
york
rule,
and
we
think
under
those
circumstances,
it
could
be
described
as--
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
--what
new
york...
what...
what
rule
65
says...
and
it
has
always
been
part
of
equity...
is
when
a
party
faces
irreparable
harm
and
has
no
adequate
remedy
at
law,
federal
courts
remain
open
and
available--
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
--no,
i'm
not.
i
just
happened
to
write
some
notes
here,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
i
cannot
point
to
some
sentence,
but
i
repeat,
mr.
chief
justice,
that
it
has
always
been
understand...
understood
to
be
a
bedrock
principle
of
federal
equity,
that
when
a
party
is
experiencing
irreparable
harm
and
has
no
adequate
remedy
at
law,
that
equity
will
come
to
the...
the
support
of
that
particular
litigant.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
no,
i'm
not
saying
that,
but
i
am
saying--
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
--i
certainly
hope
that's
not
the
situation.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
but...
but
even
if
rule
65
were
not
directly
on
point,
we
think
that
this
court's
decisions
in
byrd
v.
blue
ridge
electric
and,
indeed,
the
discussion
in
gasperini
points
to
the
fact
that
there
are
essential
characteristics
of
federal
courts
that
need
to
be
protected
even
where
the
erie
analysis
comes
into
play.
and
we
think
what
we
have
here
is
not
merely
a
response
of
a
judge
to
the
claim
of
a
plaintiff
who
has
no
other
alternatives,
it
is
a
response
to
the
fact
that
what
gmd
basically
said
to
the
court
was,
you
can
do
nothing.
catch
me
if
you
can,
but
you
have
no
power
to
do
that.
so,
what
we're
talking
about
is
a
federal
court's
ability
to
be
able
to
issue
an
effectual
judgment.
now,
this
is
a
case
where
there
was
no
defense
on
the
merits,
where
the...
the
defendant
simply
had
no
reason
to
challenge
what
was
going
on.
it
filed
counterclaims
and
then
basically
did
not
oppose
the
dismissal
of
the
counterclaims.
and
we
think
that--
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
--there
was
no--
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
--well--
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
--justice
scalia,
there
is
no
explicit
finding
of
fraud
here.
but
i
think
that,
as
the
court
of
appeals
pointed
out,
the
district
judge
thought
that
what
was
going
on
was
less
than
benign.
it
has
used
in
this
opinion
various
characterizations,
but
it
does
talk
about
the
duplicity
of
gmd
and
describes
some
of
its
conduct
and
arguments
as
particularly
disingenuous.
now,
we're
not
arguing
that
there
has
to
be
a
showing
of
fraud.
there
are
many
ways
in
which
a
party
which
as
the
investors
here
can
be
injured,
injured
in
a
way
that
means
that
they
will
never,
in
a
real
world,
recover
anything
from
a
just
claim
where
there
is
no
defense
to
a
breach
of
contract
claim.
and
that's
the
situation
that
we
have
here.
and
so,
the
question
really...
really
becomes
one
of
whether
federal
courts
can
come
to
the
rescue.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
yes.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
yes.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
the
appeal
bond
is
still
in
existence.
we
have
basically
a
final
order
on
the
underlying
merits,
namely,
the
breach
of
contract
claim.
we
have
the
permanent
injunction
which
was
not
appealed
by
gmd.
and
we
have
something
called
a
turnover
order
in
which
the
district
judge
basically
said,
the
assets
that
you've
been
required
to
hold,
now
turn
them
over
to
the
defendants.
i
might
point
out
that
because
gmd
has
made
many
efforts
to
distinguish
your
three
cases
in
deckert,
debeers,
and
first
national
city,
i
see
them
as
prismatic
cases
because
apparently
courts
and
litigants
have
held
them
up
in
all
kinds
of
ways
and
found
different
sources
of
light
coming
from
them.
but...
but
basically
this
was
a
suit
seeking
damages,
but
it
was
also
a
suit
that
sought
the
establishment
of
a
trust.
so,
if
one
wants
to
make
connections
between
this
case
and
some
of
the...
some
of
the
earlier
cases
that
have
been
at
the
center
of
this...
this
debate,
certainly
the
fact
that
a
trust
was
requested...
it
was
denied
by
the
district
judge
and
perhaps
properly
so...
then
we
have
an
equitable
claim.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
