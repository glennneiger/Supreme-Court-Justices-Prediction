justice
antonin
scalia
this
case
is
here
on
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit.
the
respondents
are
investment
funds,
who
purchase
unsecured
notes
from
the
petitioner
grupo
mexicano
de
desarrollo.
four
of,
what
we
call
the
gmd,
four
of
gmd
subsidiaries
who
are
also
petitioners
guaranteed
the
notes.
after
gmd
fell
into
financial
trouble
and
missed
an
interest
payment,
respondents
accelerated
the
principle
of
the
notes
and
filed
suit
for
the
amount
due
in
the
federal
district
court
in
new
york.
alleging
that
gmd
was
at
risk
of
insolvency,
or
indeed
was
already
insolvent,
that
it
was
preferring
its
mexican
creditors
by
its
planned
allocation
to
them
of
its
most
valuable
assets,
and
that
these
actions
would
frustrate
any
judgment,
respondents
might
ultimately
obtain,
respondents
requested
a
preliminary
injunction
restraining
petitioners
from
transferring
the
assets.
the
district
court
issued
the
preliminary
injunction
and
ordered
respondents
to
post
a
$50,000
bond.
the
second
circuit
affirmed
that
action.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
we
reverse
the
second
circuit.
there
is
a
threshold
issue
of
mootness.
after
gmd’s
petition
for
certiorari
was
filed,
the
district
court
granted
summary
judgment
to
respondents
on
their
contract
claim
and
converted
the
preliminary
injunction
into
a
final
injunction.
as
a
general
rule,
“the
appeal
of
a
preliminary
injunction
becomes
moot,
when
the
trial
court
enters
a
permanent
injunction”,
it
is
said
as
a
sort
of
legal
shorthand
that
the
former
merges
into
the
latter.
in
the
ordinary
case,
however,
the
basis
for
objecting
to
the
preliminary
injunction
is
essentially
the
same
as
the
basis
for
objecting
to
the
permanent
one
and
that
is
the
defendant
is
not
liable
and
therefore
should
not
be
enjoined.
here,
however,
the
basis
of
attack
is
different,
petitioners
assert
that
even
if
it
appeared
likely
that
they
owed
the
debt,
the
court
had
no
power
to
enjoin
their
use
of
their
own
property
until
a
money
judgment
was
actually
rendered
and
for
that
reason
they
assert,
they
were
wrongfully
deprived
of
their
ability
to
use
their
property,
which
cause
them
harm,
that
can
be
assessed
against
the
injunction
part.
we
think
that
argument
is
correct
and
that
the
case
is
therefore
not
moot.
on
the
merits
of
the
matter
we
hold
that
the
district
court
lacked
the
authority
to
issue
a
preliminary
injunction
preventing
petitioners
from
disposing
of
their
assets,
pending
adjudication
of
respondents’
contract
claim
for
money
damages
because
such
a
remedy
was
historically
unavailable
from
a
court
of
equity.
we
have
long
held
that
federal
courts
have
the
equity
jurisdiction
it
was
exercised
by
the
english
court
of
chancery
at
the
time
the
constitution
was
adopted
and
the
judiciary
act
of
1789
was
enacted.
it
is
well-established
and
uncontested
here
that
a
judgment
fixing
the
debt
was
ordinarily
necessary,
before
a
court
in
equity
would
interfere
with
an
alleged
debtor’s
use
of
its
property.
that
was
the
rule
in
the
states
and
remained
the
rule
in
england
until
the
court
of
chancery
made
what
was
regarded
as
a
dramatic
departure
from
prior
practice
in
1975.
the
merger
of
law
and
equity
did
not
change
the
rule,
since
the
merger
did
not
alter
substantive
rights
and
this
a
substantive
matter,
since
the
rule
was
regarded
as
serving
not
merely
the
procedural
end
of
assuring
exhaustion
of
legal
remedies,
but
also
the
substantive
end
of
giving
the
creditor
an
interest
in
the
property
which
equity
could
act
upon.
the
postmerger
cases
cited
in
support
of
the
injunction
are
entirely
consistent
with
the
view
that
the
preliminary
injunction
in
this
case
was
beyond
the
district
court’s
equitable
power.
enjoining
the
debtor’s
disposition
of
his
property
at
the
instance
of
a
nonjudgment
creditor
is
incompatible
with
this
court’s
traditionally
cautious
approach
to
equitable
powers,
which
leaves
any
substantial
expansion
of
past
practice
to
congress.
accepting
the
argument
of
respondents
and
the
dissent
that
equity's
flexibility
should
be
extended
to
recognize
this
remedy,
which
has
been
consistently
rejected
by
federal
courts
would
leave
us
open
to
seldon’s
famous
criticism
of
equity,
which
went
like
this;
“for
law
we
have
a
measure,
and
know
what
to
trust
to.
equity
is
according
to
the
conscience
of
him
that
is
chancellor,
and
as
that
is
larger
or
narrower,
so
is
equity.
't
is
all
one,
as
if
they
should
make
the
standard
for
the
measure
the
chancellor's
foot.
what
an
uncertain
measure
would
this
be?
one
chancellor
has
a
long
foot;
another
a
short
foot;
a
third
an
indifferent
foot.
it
is
the
same
thing
with
the
chancellor's
conscience."
the
opinion
of
the
court
is
unanimous
as
to
part
ii
the
mootness
point,
the
chief
justice
and
justices
is
o’conner,
kennedy,
and
thomas
have
joined
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
full.
justice
ginsburg
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
as
to
the
proportions
other
than
mootness
in
which
justices
stevens,
souter,
and
breyer
have
joined.
