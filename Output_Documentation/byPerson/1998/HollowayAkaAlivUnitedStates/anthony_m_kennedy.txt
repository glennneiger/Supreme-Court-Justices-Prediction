it
seems
to
me
that
your
answer
to
justice
o'connor
should
have
been
that
the
government
must
have
proof
of
a
fixed
intent
to
injure,
no
matter,
and
that
given
her
hypothetical
there
was
just
not
enough.
and
if
that's
the
answer...
i
think
that
has
to
be
your
answer.
maybe,
maybe
not.
if
that's
your
answer,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
rejoinder
is,
well,
this
is
very
difficult
to
do.
this
makes
it
a
statute
which
is
difficult
to
prosecute,
difficult
to
implement,
and
we
shouldn't
attribute
to
congress
the
objective
of
having
a
statute
which
is
really
difficult
to
obtain
convictions
under.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i'm
not
too
sure
i've
seen
many
statutes
in
which
the
conditional
intent
is
expressly
eliminated
in
favor
of
a
fixed
intent.
i
suppose
you'd
say
in
this
statute
whoever
hijacks
a
car
and
intends
in
all
events
to
cause
injury
or
death,
in
order
to
incorporate
your
view.
i've
just
never
seen
a
statute
like
that.
i'm
not
sure
which
way
that
cuts.
i
don't
know
if
that
helps
you
or
hurts
you.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
have
you
ever
seen
a
statute
like
that?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--when
you
say
10
states,
you
suggest
that
perhaps
40
have
gone
the
other
way,
but
i
gather
that
it's
10
states
who
have
weighed
in,
a
total.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i
don't
see
how
the
government
would
prosecute
the
person
with
the
water
pistol.
am
i
wrong
about
that?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
justice
ginsburg
gave
you
the
idea
of
the
toy
pistol,
or
the
water
pistol.
under
the
present
statute
that
doesn't--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--that
doesn't
meet
even
the
government's
standard,
does
it?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
no.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is
the
word
conditional
intent
something
we
have
to
be
stuck
with?
it
seems
to
me
that
specific
intent
is
difficult
enough
to
do...
how
specific.
the
hijacker
intends
to
hijack
the
car
and
rape
the
woman
because
he
saw
the
woman
in
the
store.
it
turns
out
to
be
a
different
woman,
but
he
rapes
her
anyway.
well,
in
a
way
that's
not
quite
specific
enough.
in
a
way
it
meets
the
usual
standard
of
specific
intent.
it
seems
to
me
it's
a
question
of
how
specific,
not
whether
or
not
conditional
or
not.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
if
the
petitioner
were
correct
and
we
were
to
adopt
the
conditional
intent
rule,
and
you
have
a
case
where
the
person...
or,
the
case
that
justice
o'connor
put
at
the
very
outset
of
the
argument...
points
a
gun
and
say,
give
me
your
car
or
i'll
shoot,
and
the
person
gives
the
car,
could
you
go
to
the
jury
on
that
under
a
conditional
intent
theory,
or
would
you
have
to
have
something
more?
