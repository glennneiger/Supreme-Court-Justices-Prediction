mr.
kevin
j.
keating
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
presents
an
issue
of
fundamental
importance
to
the
administration
of
criminal
justice
in
our
nation,
whether
judicial
expansion
of
an
unambiguous
statute
based
ostensibly
on
legislative
purpose
should
be
permitted.
the
second
circuit's
holding
that
the
federal
carjacking
statute
encompasses
the
unstated
and
expansive
mens
rea
element
of
conditional
intent
must
be
reversed,
as
it
contravenes
the
plain
and
unequivocal
language
of
the
statute
and
thus
violates
this
court's
longstanding
canons
of
statutory
construction.
this
alone
forecloses
the
issue.
moreover,
if
legislative
history
is
relevant,
and
we
think
it
is
not,
the
legislative
history
does
not
support
a
finding
of
conditional
intent
in
the
statute.
in
fact,
a
clear
reading
of
the
legislative
history
reveals
that
congress
could
not
have
intended
this
statute
to
be
a
conditional
intent
statute.
finally,
the
government's
assertion
that
the
concept
of
conditional
intent
can
simply
be
read
into
the
specific
intent
element,
as
there
is
a
traditional
recognition
of
the
concept
in
our
country
in
statutes
analogous
to
the
carjacking
statute
is
a
complete
fiction.
mr.
kevin
j.
keating
no,
your--
mr.
kevin
j.
keating
--no,
your
honor.
mr.
kevin
j.
keating
the
answer
is
no,
your
honor,
and
that's
precisely
why
the
district
court
improperly
instructed
the
jury
on
conditional
intent,
because
the
district
court
realized
that
that
would
not
satisfy
the
intent
element.
intent
is
generally
defined--
mr.
kevin
j.
keating
--your
honor,
if
we
define
intent
as
one's
conscious
objective,
which
is
generally
in
charges
how
the
concept
is
defined,
the
conscious
objective
of
the
man
who
points
a
gun
at
somebody
and
says,
give
me
your
keys,
is
not,
not
to
cause
the
death
or
serious
physical
harm.
in
fact,
it's
mutually
exclusive.
the
conscious
objective--
mr.
kevin
j.
keating
--your
honor,
could
they
infer
a
conditional
intent?
they
could,
clearly,
from
the
facts
presented
to
the
jury.
that
inference
could
be
drawn.
our
argument
here
is
not
that
the
concept
of
conditional
intent
is
an
unconstitutional
one.
our
argument
is
relatively
straightforward.
it's
not
here.
this
statute
doesn't
express
the
concept.
the
legislative
history
never
mentions
the
concept,
and
there
is--
mr.
kevin
j.
keating
--well,
your
honor,
the
statute
perhaps
is
difficult
to
prosecute
if
conditional
intent
is
read
into
it,
if
i'm
understanding
the
court's
question.
if
conditional
intent
is
not
somehow
magically
read
into
the
specific
intent
element,
then
the
statute
is
not
difficult
to
prosecute.
it's
not
unlike
any
other
criminal
statute
that
has
an
actus
reis,
the
taking
of
a
motor
vehicle
from
another
by
force,
violence--
mr.
kevin
j.
keating
--the
government
would
have
to
prove
that
the
defendant
intended
to
cause
the
death
or
serious
physical
harm.
mr.
kevin
j.
keating
no
matter
what.
that--
mr.
kevin
j.
keating
--certainly.
if
intent
is
to
find
his
conscious
objective--
mr.
kevin
j.
keating
--yes,
i
do.
mr.
kevin
j.
keating
i
do,
your
honor,
and--
mr.
kevin
j.
keating
--yes.
mr.
kevin
j.
keating
yes.
mr.
kevin
j.
keating
well,
the...
i...
your
honor--
mr.
kevin
j.
keating
--your
honor,
i
allow
for
the
possibility
that
this
statute
doesn't
have
the
reach
that
congress
intended.
i
allow
for
that
possibility,
and
i
allow
for
the
possibility
that
possibly
congress
didn't
think
it
all
the
way
through
when
they
enacted
the
amendment,
but
your
honor,
if
you
look
at--
mr.
kevin
j.
keating
--yes.
mr.
kevin
j.
keating
that
is
so,
your
honor,
but
at
the
same
time
cries
were
voiced
by
a
number
of
members
of
congress
that
by
doing
that
they
would
be
further
diluting
the
already-attenuated
federal
nexus
of
the
carjacking
statute.
if
you
simply
strike
the
word
firearm
virtually
every
carjacking
committed
in
our
country,
some
35,000
at
the
time
of
this
offense,
would
be
a
state
crime.
and
the
concern
was
raised
regarding
the
principles
of
federalism,
and
this
is
important--
mr.
kevin
j.
keating
--your
honor,
i
don't
think
that
very
few
would
end
up
in
federal
prosecutions.
if
a
carjacker
approaches
an
individual
on
the
street,
points
a
gun
at
them,
and
fires
at
him
and
misses,
that's
a
federal
prosecution.
mr.
kevin
j.
keating
well--
mr.
kevin
j.
keating
--no,
i
don't
believe
so,
your
honor.
and
if
you
look
at
what
congress
did
when
they
amended
this
statute,
when
they
amended
the
statute,
the
word
firearm
was
stricken.
a
version
of
the
amended
statute
came
out
of
the
house,
a
version
came
out
of
the
senate.
neither
of
those
versions
had
the
specific
intent
element.
they
were
identical.
they
simply
said,
whoever
takes
a
motor
vehicle
from
another
by
force,
violence,
or
intimidation--
mr.
kevin
j.
keating
--sure.
mr.
kevin
j.
keating
yes.
that's
precisely
what
they
wanted
to
do.
those
versions
of
the
amended
statute
go
into
committee.
there's
no
record
of
what
transpired
in
committee.
out
of
committee
comes
the
statute
with
the
specific
intent
element.
if
the
government's
interpretation
is
adopted
that
the
specific
intent
element
must
be
read
as
including
a
conditional
intent,
there
would
have
been
no
purpose
whatsoever
in
adding
the
specific
intent
clause,
because
the
statute
already
said,
whoever
takes
a
motor
vehicle
from
another
by
force,
violence,
or
intimidation.
it's
difficult
to
imagine
a
case
where
that
statute,
left
standing
alone,
where
the
government
would
not
also
be
able
to
establish
that
the
perpetrator
harbored
a
conditional
intent
to
harm,
so
why
add
the
language?
mr.
kevin
j.
keating
the
death
penalty
provision
was
added
to
the
statute,
but
if
the
court
is
asking,
is
that
why
the
intent
language
was
put
into
the
statute--
mr.
kevin
j.
keating
--to
constitutionalize
the
imposition
of
the
death
penalty,
i
believe
not,
your
honor,
for
this
reason.
as
the
court
is
aware
in
its
tison
decision
it
is
not
necessary
to
establish,
in
order
to
constitutionalize
the
death
penalty,
that
one
intends
to
cause
the
death
of
the
victim.
mr.
kevin
j.
keating
that
also
would
not
be
necessary
under
the
tison
decision.
mr.
kevin
j.
keating
well,
we
would
presume
that
congress...
and
i'll
add
to
it,
your
honor,
that
there's
another
section
of
the
amended
statute
which
deals
with
the
constitutionality
of
the
death
penalty
provisions.
mr.
kevin
j.
keating
your
honor--
mr.
kevin
j.
keating
--that's
right.
and
i'll
begin
by
saying,
your
honor,
that
it
only
depends
on
this
lengthy
history
if,
in
fact,
the
statute
is
deemed
to
be
ambiguous.
and
we
argue
that
the
statute,
the
language
of
the
statute
is
not
ambiguous,
and
rubin
instructs
that
if
the
language
of
a
statute
is
unambiguous,
the
first
canon
of
statutory
construction,
that
being
that
you
look
at
the
text--
mr.
kevin
j.
keating
--in--
mr.
kevin
j.
keating
--in
support
of
their
assertion
that
there
is
a
longstanding
recognition
of
conditional
intent,
the
government
cites
to
not
a
single
federal
statute
which
expresses
the
concept.
they
cite
to
not
a
single
decision
of
this
court
which
embraces
the
concept.
they
cite
to
a
handful
of
state--
mr.
kevin
j.
keating
--a
handful
of
state
court
precedents
which
seem
to
embrace
the
concept
in
varying
contexts.
some
of
these
citations
were
to
attempts.
attempts
is
a
different
animal
altogether
than
a
completed
crime
in
the
context
of
a
conditional
intent.
mr.
kevin
j.
keating
well,
i
suppose
it
cuts
both
ways,
but
it
would
have
been
very
simple,
your
honor,
to
do
this.
with
intent
to
cause
death
or
serious
physical
harm
if
necessary.
if
necessary.
that's--
mr.
kevin
j.
keating
--no,
and
your
honor,
that
proves
the
point.
if
conditional
intent
can
simply
be
read
into
the
specific
intent
element,
we
would
expect
to
see
pages
upon
pages
of
citations
from
the
government
expressing
that
concept.
mr.
kevin
j.
keating
because
it's
never
been
applied,
your
honor.
mr.
kevin
j.
keating
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
kevin
j.
keating
the
government
cites
10
cases,
10
state
cases
that
stand
for
the
proposition;
10,
of
course,
out
of
50,
hardly
a
traditional
recognition
of
the
concept.
with
regard
to
the
model
penal
code,
your
honor,
while
the
model
penal
code
embraces
the
concept
of
conditional
intent,
it
then
greatly
limits
its
application,
and
the
government
provides
half
a
definition
of
the
code's
concept
of
conditional
intent
in
the
brief.
conditional
intent
will
always
depend
on
the
attendant
circumstances.
i
will
take
your
car
unless
you
give...
or,
i
will
shoot
you
unless
you
give
me
the
keys.
the
giving
of
the
keys
are
the
attendant
circumstances.
the
code
states
that
where
attendant
circumstances
is
an
element,
the
element
can
be
satisfied
if
the
actor
is
aware
of
the
attendant
circumstances
or
hopes
or
believes
in
its
existence.
as
awareness
of
the
attendant
circumstance
can
never
be
guaranteed,
the
code
allows
for
conviction
if
the
actor
is
aware
of
a
high
probability.
therefore,
under
the
model
penal
code
they
allow
for
the
recognition
of
conditional
intent,
but
only
if
the
actor
is
aware
of
a
high
probability
of
the
condition
occurring,
or
is
aware
or
hopes
in
its
existence.
and
that
interpretation
of
the
code
has
been
adopted
by
at
least
one
circuit,
the
first
circuit,
in
recognizing
conditional
intent.
mr.
kevin
j.
keating
it
would
apply
here,
your
honor,
at
a
minimum
to
the
fact
that
the
district
court
improperly
charged
the
jury
on
the
notion
of
conditional
intent.
mr.
kevin
j.
keating
that
is
one
of
our
points
in
the
opinion,
your
honor.
mr.
kevin
j.
keating
your
honor,
at
bottom
the
statute
doesn't
express
the
concept
of
conditional
intent.
in
support
of
their
position
that
there's
a
general
recognition
of
it,
there's
10
states
that
seem
to
embrace
the
concept
out
of
50.
mr.
kevin
j.
keating
some
have
rejected
it,
as
cited
in
our
brief.
they
cite
for
approximately...
i
think
it
was
12
states.
we
cite
to
five
states
who
have
rejected
the
concept
altogether.
and
if,
in
fact,
there
are
only...
if
it
is
10
states,
again,
we
would
expect
to
see
some
statutory
construction.
there
aren't
any
which
embrace
the
concept
of
conditional
intent.
your
honor,
the
second
circuit's
decision
here
was
in
part
based
upon
the
view
that
congressional
inadvertence
had
led
to
this
statute
that
has
unintended
consequences.
if
that's
the
case,
if
this
court
feels
that
that's
the
case,
the
court
has
already
passed
on
that
issue.
the
casey
case
in
1991,
where
that
exact
claim
was
made
that
a
congressional
omission
had
led
to
a
statute
with
unintended
consequences,
the
court
held
that
so
long
as
the
text
is
unambiguous,
the
text
is
the
text.
in
1926,
the
court
held
the
same
in
the
iselin
case.
there,
the
claim
was--
mr.
kevin
j.
keating
--casey
was
in
1991,
your
honor.
mr.
kevin
j.
keating
i
think
it's
cited
in
the
amicus
brief.
mr.
kevin
j.
keating
yes.
mr.
kevin
j.
keating
i
don't
recall,
your
honor,
candidly.
mr.
kevin
j.
keating
i
will.
mr.
kevin
j.
keating
your
honor,
the
principle
is
applied
with
equal
force
to
claims
of
congressional
forgetfulness.
in
iselin,
the
very
claim
was
made
that
again
an
omission
by
congress
led
to
a
statute
with
unintended
consequences,
and
once
more,
this
court
held
that
to
rewrite
the
statute
transcends
the
function
of
the
court.
it's
important
to
note
the
government's
retreat
on
this
issue.
earlier,
in
the
second
circuit,
the
government
argued,
indeed,
that
this
statute
resulted
from
congressional
inadvertence.
they
now--
mr.
kevin
j.
keating
--could
you
repeat
that,
your
honor,
please?
mr.
kevin
j.
keating
yes,
that
is
our
view,
and
our
view
is
also
that
congress
did
not
intend
it
to
be
a
conditional
intent
statute.
they
couldn't
have,
for
the
reasons
i've
already
argued,
because
it
would
read
the
specific
intent
element
right
out
of
the
statute.
there
would
be
no
purpose
at
all
in
putting
the
specific
intent
element
in.
mr.
kevin
j.
keating
maybe
that's
one
hypothetical
that
fits,
your
honor.
i
can't
imagine
that
congress
decided
to
enact
this
statute
for
the
purposes
of
that
hypothetical.
the--
mr.
kevin
j.
keating
--well,
under
the
government's
reading,
though,
with
conditional
intent,
of
course,
they
all
qualify,
and
they
all
would
have
qualified,
your
honor,
under
the
prior
statute,
without
the
specific
intent
element.
mr.
kevin
j.
keating
under
which
version,
your
honor?
mr.
kevin
j.
keating
under
the
present
statute--
mr.
kevin
j.
keating
--no.
mr.
kevin
j.
keating
it
would
be
difficult
to
prove
a
conditional
intent
to--
mr.
kevin
j.
keating
--your
honor,
i
don't
agree.
i
don't
think
it's
a
matter
of
specificity.
they
are
different
terms
altogether.
one
is
a
conscious
intention.
if
somebody
points
a
gun
at
another
person,
their
intent
to
cause
their
death
or
serious
physical
harm
is
evidenced
by
one
thing,
pulling
that
trigger.
they
have
a
conscious
design,
a
conscious
intention
to
cause
death
or
serious
physical
harm.
mr.
kevin
j.
keating
yes,
but
there's
no
conditionality
of
purpose--
mr.
kevin
j.
keating
--right,
i
understand.
[laughter]
i
understand.
i'm
just...
i'm
expanding
on
that
thought,
your
honor.
mr.
kevin
j.
keating
i
agree,
your
honor,
and
it's
evidenced
by
one
thing,
one's
conscious
design.
mr.
kevin
j.
keating
not
at
the
time
of
the
commission
of
the
crime,
your
honor.
at
the
time
this
crime
was
committed,
the
taking
of
the
motor
vehicle,
there
was
not
an
intention
to
kill.
mr.
kevin
j.
keating
no,
which
is
precisely
why
the
district
court
charged
on
conditional
intent.
mr.
kevin
j.
keating
there
was
no
conduct
at
all
which
evidenced
an
intention
to
kill.
there
was
conduct
which
evidenced
the
fact
that
the
defendants
prepared,
perhaps,
or
anticipated
forming
an
intention
to
kill
in
the
future,
but
there
was
nothing
the
jury
can
rest
on
to
conclude
that
they
intended
to
kill
these
people.
mr.
kevin
j.
keating
that
they
could
have
concluded
that,
and
that
fits
the
conditional
intent--
mr.
kevin
j.
keating
--requirement,
of
course.
mr.
kevin
j.
keating
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
kevin
j.
keating
that
was
one
of
the
three
carjackings,
yes.
mr.
kevin
j.
keating
in
the
other
two
carjackings,
in
one
of
them
the
gun
never
came
out
of
the
pocket,
which
was
possessed
by
a
codefendant.
in
one
of
the
others,
the
gun
was
brandished
but
a
threat
was
not
uttered.
mr.
kevin
j.
keating
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
kevin
j.
keating
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i'll
reserve
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
kevin
j.
keating
thank
you,
your
honor.
the
burglary
example.
when
the
burglar
enters
the
dwelling
in
an
unauthorized
fashion,
at
that
time
he
has
an
intention
to
commit
a
crime
therein.
that
is
why
the
burglary
cases
don't
stand
for
the
proposition,
or
don't
stand
for
a
recognition
of
conditional
intent,
absent
a
hypothetical
involving--
mr.
kevin
j.
keating
--but
your
honor,
at
the
time
of
the
commission
of
the
crime--
mr.
kevin
j.
keating
--entering
the
building,
that
intention
he
has.
he
had--
mr.
kevin
j.
keating
--well,
he
may
have
alternative
intentions
at
that
time,
but
he
has
the
presently-held
intention
to
do
future
harm.
mr.
kevin
j.
keating
your
honor,
i
would
disagree
under
the
facts
of
this
case.
at
the
time
of--
mr.
kevin
j.
keating
--well,
i
think
there
is
a
distinction
between
a
conditional
intent
and
alternative
intentions.
the
carjacker
at
the
time
he
took
the
car,
the
jury
found
that
had
certain
future
acts
occurred,
which
they
didn't,
they
would
have
done
something,
different
from,
at
the
time
of
the
commission
of
the
crime
he
has
the
presently-held
intention
to
cause
harm.
that's--
mr.
kevin
j.
keating
--in
the
future,
not
at
the
time
of
the
commission
of
the
crime,
unlike
the
burglar
who
enters
the
dwelling.
conditional
intent
was
not
expressed
in
the
statute.
the
concept
was
never
discussed
in
the
legislative
history.
10
states
recognize
it
in
various
forms.
five
don't,
as
cited
in
our
brief.
the
model
penal
code,
of
course,
has
never
been
adopted.
the
model
penal
code
doesn't
stand
for
the
concept
of
conditional
intent
endorsed
by
the
government.
our
argument
is
simple.
what
happened
here
is
that
the
court
below
was
unhappy
with
the
reach
of
this
statute.
it
didn't
reach
out
to
where
it
thought
it
should,
and
the
court
below
twisted
the
statute
to
get
the
bad
guy.
that's
what
happened
here,
and
for
that
reason,
this
conviction
should
be
reversed.
thank
you.
