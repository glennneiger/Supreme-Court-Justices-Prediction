justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
have
a
little
trouble
with
understanding
the
concept
of
intent
and
conditional
intent.
i
don't
find
many
cases
dealing
with
the
so-called
conditional
intent,
but
intent
is
very
broad,
and
is
it
possible
that
someone
who
stops
a
motorist
with
a
gun,
saying,
give
me
your
keys,
and
pointing
the
gun
at
him,
could
be
said...
could
the
fact-finder
find
intent
to
cause
death
or
serious
bodily
injury
from
that--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--happening?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
if
not,
why
not?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
why?
that's
up
to
the
jury,
and
they
can
determine
it
from
circumstantial
evidence.
and
if
the
circumstances
are
the
use
of
a
deadly
weapon
and
the
demand
for
the
keys
and
the
vehicle
and
the
use
of
the
weapon
in
hand,
i
would
think
the
jury
could
find
intent
to
cause
serious
injury.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
wait
a
minute.
i
don't
think
you've
answered
justice
kennedy's
question.
what
do
you
think
the
government
has
to
prove
under
subsection
1
to
permit
the
15-year
penalty
because
there
is
in
fact
no
serious
injury?
what
do
you
think
the
government
has
to
prove
to
get
a
conviction,
as
this
statute
is
now
written
under
1?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
no
matter
what.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
whether
or
not
he
got
the
car.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
if
that
was
what
congress
intended,
they
sure
made
a
hash
of
this
statute,
didn't
they,
with
their
amendment.
you
think
that's
what
congress
thought
they
were
doing
here?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
don't
you
think
there
are
many
carjackings
that
occur
all
the
time
without
the
resulting
serious
injury?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
with
somebody
who
says,
well,
i'll
do
it
if
i
have
to.
i'll
hurt
them
if
i
have
to,
but
i'm
going
to
get
the
car.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
congress
didn't
intend
to
cover
those
cases,
in
your
view.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
mean,
that's
kind
of
a...
i
think
congress
might
be
surprised
with
your
view
of
what
it
had
done.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
you
think--
--yes,
but--
--we
should
give
it
your
interpretation
in
the
interests
of
federalism
and
leave
these
things
to
the
states,
because
under
your
reading
of
it
very
few
are
going
to
end
up
in
federal
prosecutions.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
i
thought
here
the
perpetrators
had
a
weapon
and
told
a
victim,
i
have
a
gun,
i'm
going
to
shoot,
let
me
have
the
car,
in
effect,
or
the
keys,
and
that
was
the
evidence.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
right.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
one
was,
get
out
of
the
car
or
i'll
shoot,
and
so
forth.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
uh-huh.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
aren't
those--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--aren't
those
examples
of
cases
where
the
evidence
could
show
the
necessary
intent?
the
jury
could
determine
it
from
the
evidence.
i
don't
see
how
it
necessarily
invokes
the
conditional
intent
doctrine.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
you
go
into
a
house,
break
and
enter
with
the
intent
to
steal
a
television
and
it
turns
out
there
isn't
a
television.
if
there's
evidence
introduced
that
can
establish
that
that
was
the
intent,
that
would
suffice.
i
don't
think
you'd
speak
in
terms
of
conditional
intent,
would
you?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
that
gets
us
to
how
clear
that
background
is,
and
is
there
more
than
just
a
handful
of
state
cases?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
how
do
we
know
that's
the
background?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--now,
these...
the
people
before
us
here,
were
they
prosecuted
under
the
first
subsection,
because
no
serious
bodily
injury
occurred?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
thank
you.
