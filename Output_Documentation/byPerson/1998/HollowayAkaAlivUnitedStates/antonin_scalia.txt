justice
antonin
scalia
well,
it
says
or
serious
bodily
harm
anyway,
which
wouldn't
suffice
to
comply
with
our
constitutional
requirements.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
look--
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
keating,
your
case
ultimately
hangs,
it
seems
to
me,
on
the
text.
whatever
congress
meant,
whatever
they
intended,
you
come
up
here
and
you
say,
this
is
what
they
wrote.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
the
guts
of
your
case
is
whether,
indeed,
that
language,
with
intent
to
cause
death
or
serious
bodily
harm,
is
susceptible
of
a
conditional
interpretation.
and
that,
in
turn,
depends
upon
whether
there
is
this
lengthy
history
of
interpreting
provisions
that
way.
you
started
to
say
that
there
was
no
such
history.
i'd
like
to
hear
you
say
more
about
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
government
says
that
there...
you
know,
this
is...
we
do
this
all
the
time.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
it's
ambiguous
if
language
like
this
has,
for
hundreds
of
years,
been
interpreted
to
be
satisfied
by
conditional
intent,
okay.
justice
antonin
scalia
can
we
get
to
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
cite
a
handful?
they
cited
two
things.
justice
antonin
scalia
how
many
states
do
you--
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
the
difference
between
first
degree
murder
and
manslaughter,
or
at
least
second
degree
murder.
you
intend
the
death,
and
that's
a
traditional
distinction
in
the
common
law,
isn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
i'm...
i'm
not
attacking
you.
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
a
fairly
well-known
distinction
in
the
common
law,
to
require
a
specific
intent
to
kill.
i
mean,
that's
what
first
degree
murder
statutes
are
based
on.
justice
antonin
scalia
is
there
anything
that
would
not
be
covered
by
your
interpretation
of
the
statute,
short
of
the
water
pistol
or
the
index
finger
in
the
pocket?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
suppose
they
hadn't
put
in,
with
intend
to
cause
death
or
serious
bodily
harm,
would
there
be
any
difference
between
a
statute
without
that
phrase,
and
your
interpretation
of
the
statute
with
that
phrase--
justice
antonin
scalia
--except
the
instance
of
the
water
gun
and
the,
you
know,
the
phony
pistol?
justice
antonin
scalia
why
didn't
congress
just
say
what
it
meant,
if
it
meant
what
you
say
it
meant?
it
could
have
said,
by
threat
of
force
or
violence,
which
the...
which
the
individual
was
prepared
to
follow
through
on.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
the
language,
with
intent
to
cause
death
or
serious
bodily
harm,
i
mean,
you
know,
whatever
congress
meant,
i
don't
think
that
if
i
threaten
someone
with
a
gun
hoping
that
the
person
will
turn
over
the
car,
i
don't
want
to
kill
the
person.
why
do
i
want
to
be
running
from
a
murder
rap
instead
of
a
carjacking?
i
definitely
hope
not
to
have
to
kill
the
person.
i
just
don't
describe
that
by
the
intent
to
cause
death
or
serious
bodily
harm.
it's
a
very
unreasonable
interpretation
of
that
language,
it
seems
to
me.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
doesn't
that
require
the
actual
assault
intending
to
hurt
the
person?
justice
antonin
scalia
not
in
my
lexicon.
i
mean...
you
mean
if
someone...
you
think
it's
assault
with
intent
to
do
serious
bodily
harm
if
you
tell
someone,
get
out
of
the
way
or
i'll
punch
you
in
the
nose.
that
is
assault
with
intent
to
do
serious
bodily
harm.
justice
antonin
scalia
i'll
break
your
nose,
okay.
justice
antonin
scalia
let's
keep
guns
out
of
it.
i
mean,
this
is
an
assault
statute,
serious
bodily
harm.
it
seems
to
me...
it
seems
to
me
you
have
to
intend
to
hurt
the
person,
not
just
intend
to
get
the
person
out
of
the
way.
maybe
you
have
a
case
or
two
that
interprets
it
the
other
way,
but
that's
not
how
i
read
the
language,
anyway.
it
just
doesn't
mean
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
no.
you
don't
in
that
case
because
you
hope
that
there
will
be
a
television
set
there,
and
the
difference
here
is
that
you
don't
hope
that
the
person
will
resist
and
cause
you
to
kill
him.
your
hope
is
just
the
opposite.
justice
antonin
scalia
in
the
television
set
case,
i
agree
with
you,
that
kind
of
statute
covers
the
person
breaking
in
and
there's
no
television
set,
but
he
hoped
that
there
would
be
a
television
set,
and
the
whole
intent
in
breaking
in
was
to
take
it.
whereas
here,
he
doesn't
hope
to
kill
the
person.
he
had
no
intent
to
kill
the
person.
i
mean--
justice
antonin
scalia
--no
intent
in
the
normal...
in
the
way
i
normally
use
intent,
anyway.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
but--
justice
antonin
scalia
--i
can...
i
mean,
i
can
accept
the
model
penal
code
thing
if
you're
hoping
for
something
that
is
very
unlikely
to
occur.
you
break
into
a
house
of
a
woman
you
don't
know
from
adam,
and
you
hope
she'll
consent
to
have
sex
with
you,
but
you
know,
the
chances
are
99...
999
to
1,000
that
she
won't,
and
now
i'm
perfectly
willing
to
put
that
person
away
for
breaking
with
intent
to
commit
rape,
because
he
knew
that
what
he
was
hoping
for,
you
know,
would
virtually
be
impossible
to
happen.
but
it's
not
virtually
impossible
to
happen
when
you
point
a
gun
at
somebody
and
say,
your
car
or
your
life,
it's
very
unlikely
the...
you
know,
the
old
jack
benny
bit,
he's
not
going
to
say,
well,
you
know,
i'm
thinking.
i'm
thinking.
[laughter]
take
the
car.
justice
antonin
scalia
excuse
me,
what
would
they
have
been
prosecuted
for
if
subsection
(1)
was
not
applicable?
would
they
have
gotten
off
scott
free,
or
is
there
some
other
offense
they
could
have
been
convicted
of?
justice
antonin
scalia
no
other
federal--
justice
antonin
scalia
--state
robbery--
justice
antonin
scalia
but
it
wouldn't
be
attempted
murder.
they
didn't
try
to
kill
anybody.
they
stole
a
car.
it's
not
totally
irrational
to
say
that
if
you
steal
a
car
with
the
intent
to
do
serious
personal
injury
or
murder
you're
going
to
get
a
higher
offense,
a
higher
federal
crime.
i
mean,
they...
this
isn't
attempted
murder.
you
couldn't
have
gotten
them
on
attempted
murder.
i
mean,
assuming
somebody
had
the
intent.
justice
antonin
scalia
don't
you
have
to
go
further
along
the
line?
i
mean,
to
intend
to
murder
somebody
is
not
attempted
murder.
justice
antonin
scalia
don't
you
have
to
have...
taken
a
certain
number
of
steps
along
the
line
to
be
guilty
of
an
attempt?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
there's
no
federal
attempted
murder
statute.
there's
no
federal
general
murder
statute.
it's
not
irrational
for
congress
to
say,
you
know,
we're
going
to
expand
federal
criminal
law,
but
we're
not
going
to
expand
it
to
all
carjackings.
we're
going
to
expand
it
to
a
carjacking
where
there's
attempted
murder
involved,
if--
justice
antonin
scalia
they
knew
all
this
background
that
you're
telling
us
now.
