the
carjacking
statute
makes
it
a
federal
crime
to
take
a
car
from
a
person
by
force
or
intimidation
with
intent
to
cause
death
or
serious
bodily
harm.
petitioner
suggests
that
the
statute
only
punishes
carjackers
who
intend
to
cause
death
or
serious
bodily
harm
whether
or
not
their
victims
resist,
but
that
interpretation
makes
no
sense.
the
way
this
phrase
came
into
the
statute,
the
traditional
meaning
of
the
phrase
used
in
this
way
in
penal
codes
and
at
common
law,
and
the
structure
of
the
statute,
all
show
that
congress
could
not
have
used
the
word
intent
with
that
limited
meaning.
i'd
like
to
talk
about
the
way
the
phrase
came
into
the
statute.
in
1992,
congress
made
it
a
crime
to
take
a
car
by
force
and
violence
or
intimidation
from
a
person
while
possessing
a
firearm.
in
1994,
congress
took
out
the
firearm
and
substituted
the
requirement
of
intent
to
cause
death
or
serious
bodily
harm.
when
they
took
out
the
firearm
requirement,
as
several
justices
have
noticed,
they
thought
they
were
broadening
the
statute,
not
narrowing
it.
the
supporters
of
the
amendment
wanted
to
reach
the
carjacker
who
drags
the
victim
along
behind
the
car,
or
who
uses
a
knife
or
a
pipe
or
some
other
instrument
rather
than
a
gun.
the
original
proposal
was
to
take
out
the
firearm
requirement
without
putting
anything
new
in,
but
congress
eventually
decided
to
replace
one
limitation
with
another.
it
substituted
a
dangerous
state
of
mind
for
a
dangerous
weapon,
so
that
federal
carjackings
would
continue
to
be
those
that
present
a
serious
risk
of
death
or
serious
bodily
harm.
and
precisely
what
that
condition
rules
out
is
the
extremely
common,
not
at
all
uncommon
practice
of
committing
a
robbery
with
an
unloaded
gun
or
a
water
pistol
or
a
toy
gun,
or
a
finger
in
a
pocket
purporting
to
be
a
gun,
a
frightening
experience
but
not
one
that
risks
killing
someone
the
way
committing
a
robbery
with
a
weapon,
under
the
old
statute,
or
with
intent
to
kill,
under
the
new
statute
does.
both
of
those,
those
are
alternative
ways
of
restricting
federal
carjacking
to
the
most
dangerous
sorts
of
carjacking.
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
its
intent
to
scare,
essentially,
and
it
is
just
what
this
defendant
argued
to
the
jury.
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
yes.
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
well,
it's
the
water
gun,
the
phony
pistol,
or
even
a
loaded
gun
if
the
jury
is
convinced,
or
is
not
convinced
that
he
intended
to
use
it.
that
is,
this
defendant
argued
to
the
jury
when
he
lost
on
the
construction
of
the
statute
that
nevertheless
i
never
intended
that
this
gun
be
fired.
i
never
intended...
i
was
only
intending
to
scare.
he
didn't
testify
to
this
effect.
it
was
his
lawyer's
argument
that
the
government
had
not
proved
that
he
had
any
intent
that
his
threat
would
materialize,
and
that
was
a
fair...
that
argument
was
allowed
to
go
to
the
jury,
and
if
they
had
failed
to
find
intent
actually
to
deliver
on
the
threat,
he
should
have
been
acquitted.
that's
what
the
jury
was
charged.
there
was
additional
evidence
beyond
the
loaded
gun
in
this
case.
there
was
the
evidence
that
he
and
his
accomplice
had
discussed
the
use
of
the
gun,
and
there
was
the
evidence
that
he
had
actually
used
physical
force,
not
deadly
force,
that
he
had
punched
one
of
the
victims,
so
it
was
a
case
in
which
the
claim
that
he
didn't
actually
intend
to
deliver
on
the
threat
was
less
likely
to
be
well
received.
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
that's
correct.
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
well,
sometimes
it's--
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
--i
think
the
evidence
is
to
the
contrary,
though,
for
two
reasons.
one
is
that
congress
in
this
omnibus
crime
bill
added
the
death
penalty
to
a
great
many
crimes
and
didn't
adjust
the
intent
requirements
for
those
crimes.
it
took
care
of
that
problem
in
a
separate
statute,
in
separate
provisions
that
were
also
part
of
this
omnibus
crime
bill
where
it
said,
established
the
procedures
for
the
death
penalty
and
found
that
in
addition
to
finding
the
defendant
guilty
of
whatever
crime
it
was,
the
appropriate
intent
requirements
had
to
be
satisfied,
so
there
was
no
need
to
adjust
the
particular
crime,
the
carjacking
crime
and,
indeed,
no
other
of
the
crimes
that
were
made
capital
were
adjusted
in
that
way
in
their
intent
requirements.
the
other--
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
--well--
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
--well,
except
for
the
fact
that
there
is
a
long
tradition
of
using
it
precisely
that
way
where
the
phrase
is
being
used
as
an
aggrevator,
as
it
is
here.
that
is
to
say,
the
more
usual
place
for
such
a
phrase
is
in
an
assault
statute,
assault,
and
then
assault
is
made
more
serious
when
it's
committed
with
intent
to
kill,
or
with
intent
to
do
bodily
injury.
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
no.
what
that
requires,
it's
just
those
cases...
many
of
the
cases
that
we've
cited
for
this
conditional
intent
proposition
are
cases
of
assault
with
intent
to
injure
or
do
serious
bodily
harm.
and
there's
a
federal
case
involving
some
because
the
federal
assault
statute,
the
one
about
assault
on
special
maritime
or
special
federal
territorial
jurisdiction,
has
such
a
provision.
and
in
the
shaffer
case
cited
in
the
brief
somebody
escapes
from
a
military
stockade,
points
a
gun
at
the
guards
and
says,
wait
in
the
latrine
or
i'll
shoot.
and
he
then
escapes,
doesn't
shoot,
and
he
is
convicted,
and
the
conviction
is
sustained
over
just
such
an
attack,
on
the
grounds
that
his
intent
was
to
injure
if
the
threat
wasn't
enough,
and
that
that
satisfies
the
requirement
of
this
statute.
it's
a
particular
way
of
structuring
statutes
where
there's
a
base
crime
and
then
they're
made
more
serious--
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
--with
the
qualification
that
i'm
not
sure
punching
you
in
the
nose
qualifies
as
seriously
bodily
harm,
but
with
intent
to--
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
--at
the
point...
well,
serious
bodily
harm...
how
about,
i'll
shoot,
or
i'll...
you
know.
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
well,
i
think,
1)
the
words
bear
that
meaning;
2)
this
kind
of
statute,
this...
not
just
the
phrase
intent
sitting
by
itself,
but
intent
to
cause
death
or
serious
bodily
harm
is
a
standard
phrase
that
is
used
to
escalate
a
statute.
the
other
place
it
appears
is
in
burglary
statutes.
burglary
is
commonly
defined
as
entering
a
premises,
sometimes
entering
it
unlawfully,
and
then
there's
a
further
intent,
an
intent
to
do
a
crime
therein,
sometimes
there's
a
list
of
specified
crimes,
and
the
intent
need
not
be
carried
out,
and
it
need
not
be
unconditional.
one
example
that
is
given
is
assault
with...
i
mean,
burglary,
entering
a
house
with
intent
to
have
consensual
sexual
relations
with
the
person
inside,
but
if
not
successful
in
accomplishing
that,
then
to
rape.
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
that's
another
example
of
an
intent
that--
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
--those
various
condition--
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
--well,
i
agree
that
you
don't
need
to
use
the
word,
conditional
intent,
if
you
adopt
an
appropriate
notion
of
intent,
but
if
we...
but
on
these
instructions,
this
defendant
was
found--
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
--you
don't
need
to
speak
in
terms
of
conditional
intent.
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
that's
correct.
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
he
did
have
intent--
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
--he
had
intent
to
kill
the
person
in
precisely
the
way
that
intent
has
commonly
been
understood
in
statutes
of
this
general
form.
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
that's
correct,
and
that's--
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
--burglary,
entering
a
house
with
intent
to
rape,
even
though
it
isn't
necessary
to
use
force,
then
the
rape
won't
happen,
and
he
undoubtedly
hopes
he
won't
have
to.
i'd
like
to--
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
--another
common
circumstance
for
finding
burglary,
entry
with
intent
to
commit
a
crime,
is
when
a
person
breaks...
you
have
essentially
domestic
violence,
when
a
person
breaks...
goes
into
either
the
house
of
his
ex-wife
or
his
girlfriend
and
hopes
that
they
will
reconcile,
but
if
they...
but
has
the
plan
that
if
he
can't
persuade
her
to
reconcile
he
will
shoot
her,
and
that's
been
found
to
be
burglary,
entering
the
house
with
intent
to
commit
a
crime,
even
though
he
hopes
he
won't
have
to
commit
the
crime.
i
don't
say
that...
the
point
is,
congress
used
these
words
against
a
background
in
which
that
kind
of
phrase,
as
an
aggrevator
to
an
underlying--
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
--there's--
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
--well,
we
have...
we
have
the
state
cases
that
we've
cited.
we
have
some
federal
cases
that
we've
also
cited.
the
one
i've
just
described
is
one
of
them.
we
have
the
universal
view,
universal
view
of
the
treatise
writers,
and
if
i
might
just
address
the
suggestion
that
the
model
penal
code
is
awash
because
of
this
provision
about
attendant
circumstances,
that
provision
has
absolutely
nothing
to
do
with
what
we
have
here.
that's
a
provision...
an
attendant
circumstance
is
an
element
of
the
crime
in
the
model
penal
code's
terminology,
other
than
what
he
does
or
what
he
thinks.
for
example,
in
this
case,
the
fact
that
the
car
had
to
travel
in
interstate
commerce
is
an
attendant
circumstance,
and
what
the
model
penal
code
is
talking
about
is,
what
kind
of
intent...
when
the
statute
requires
the
defendant
to
intend
or
know
about
attendant
circumstances,
what
does
that
mean,
and
since
you
don't
intend,
it
doesn't
make
sense
linguistically
to
talk
about
intending
something
you
don't
do.
they
say
what
it
means
is,
you
have
to
know
about
it,
or
believe
it's
true,
or
hope
it's
true,
or
something
like
that.
this
is
not
a
case
involving
an
attendant
circumstance.
this
is
a
case
involving
the
defendant's
intent
to
kill,
or
to
inflict
serious
bodily
injury.
that
provision
simply
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
matter.
we're
simply
construing
intent,
and
we're
construing
it
against
the
background
of
the
use
of
the
phrase,
and
we're...
and
the
fact,
i
would
say,
that
there
are
not
more
cases,
that
might
be
said
to
be
awash.
it
is
so
traditionally
understood
that
this
is
so,
you
only
get
an
appellate
case
when
somebody
raises
the
suggestion
that
the
evidence
is
insufficient,
or
the
charge
was
wrong,
and
there's
litigation
about
it.
this
is
an
accepted
and
traditional
use.
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
that
he
had
the
intent
to...
that
he
ex...
that
he
had
the
plan
to
do
so,
that
it
was
his
purpose
to
do
so
if
necessary
to
effectuate
the
objective
here
if
necessary
to
get
the
car,
or
if
the
car
wasn't
turned
over.
that's
exactly
what
this
jury
was
charged,
and
this
defendant
took
issue
with
that,
and
put
his
case
to
the
jury
that
he
didn't
have
that
intent,
and
the
jury
found
that
he
did.
and
so
the
question
now
is
only
whether...
whether
that's
enough,
whether
that
satisfies
congress'
purpose
here,
and
it
did.
i
think
the
structure
of
the
statute
makes
that
plain.
the
statute
provides
for
taking
a
car
either
by
force
or
by
intimidation.
it's
pretty
hard
to
injure
or
kill
somebody
by
intimidation
alone,
so
it's
hard
to
see
how
someone
with
unconditional
intent
to
injure
or
kill
could
commit
a
carjacking
by
intimidation.
and
the
statute
provides
three
penalty
levels,
one
of
them
involving
no
serious
injury.
and
again,
it
would
be
an
unusual
case
where
a
person
took
a
car
by
force
from
a
person
right
up
close,
intending
to
injure
him
no
matter
what,
and
didn't
succeed
in
injuring
him.
petitioner
says
that
the
provision--
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
--yes.
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
yes,
they
were.
petitioner
says
that
these
provisions,
the
intimidation
provisions--
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
--some
federal
offense?
i
don't
think
there--
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
--i
don't
believe
there...
there
would
be
a
state
robbery
prosecution.
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
well,
i'm
sorry.
there
were
chop
shop
offenses
here.
i
mean,
this
was...
the
reason,
or
a
reason
why
this
was
prosecuted
federally
is
that
this
is
a
group
of
people
who
are
stealing
cars
to
order,
and
the
indictment
also
charges
the
conspiracy
and
charges
the
chop
shop
offenses.
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
i
don't...
these
are
cars
which
could
be
proved
to
have
traveled
interstate.
i'm
not
sure
there
was
proof--
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
--that
these
defendants--
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
--right.
i
don't
believe
there's
proof
of
that
in
this
case.
on
petitioner's
interpretation,
the
statute
punishes
simply
a
combination
of
two
unrelated
crimes,
robbery
of
a
car,
and
murder
or
attempted
murder
or
serious
assault.
people
who
set
out
to
steal
a
car
don't
usually
have
the
independent
intent
to
kill
or
injure
no
matter
what,
and
if
they
do
we
call
the
crime
murder
or
attempted
murder.
we
don't
call
it
robbery
of
a
motor
vehicle
resulting
in
death.
congress
put
this
crime
in
the
robbery
chapter
of
title
18,
along
with
all
the
other
robberies,
and
captioned
it
motor
vehicles,
showing
that
the
heart
of
this
offense
was
forcibly
stealing
a
car.
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
no,
but
the
intent
that
petitioner
would
like
to
read
into
the
statute
turns
it
into
attempted
murder.
you
have
to
actually...
you
intend
to
kill
somebody
and
rob
and
take
his
car,
and
you
take
some
steps
toward
that
end.
namely,
you
take
the
car
and
stick...
and
point
a
gun
at
him.
if
you
have
that
state
of
mind,
you
are
engaging,
i
would
say,
in
attempted
murder,
and
that
is
not
what
congress
was
driving
at
here.
what
congress
was
driving
at,
dangerous...
or,
dangerous
robberies.
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
no.
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
you
do,
but
i
would
suggest
that
taking
a
gun
and
pointing
it
at
him
and
saying...
and
taking
his
car
could
well
qualify
as
getting
to
the
point
of
attempted
murder.
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
yes,
it
does.
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
no,
i
mean,
there
are
cases
about
when
mere
preparation
becomes
attempt,
but
it
seems
to
me
when
you've
come
into
direct
confrontation
with
him
and
taken
out
the
gun
with
an...
with,
contrary
to
what
we
believe
the
statute
requires,
or
perhaps
what
the
evidence
proved,
you
have
an
unconditional
intent
to
kill
him.
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
they
might
have
done
that,
but
what
they
had...
remember
that
where
this
came
from
is,
it
was
a
statute
that
punished
carjackings
with
weapons.
the
weapon
was
removed
to
reach
analogous
crimes
that
happened
without...
excuse
me,
without
firearms
but
with
something
else,
and
then
there
was
a
concern
that
that
expanded
the
statute
too
far,
so
the
idea
was
to
bring
it
back
to
close
to
where
it
was
before,
but
put
in
a
dangerous
intent
instead
of
a
dangerous...
instead
of
a
dangerous
weapon.
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
no.
there's
no...
what
we
have
in
this
case
is
no
expressed
statement
about
what
that
was...
what
was
happening
when
that
provision
came
in.
we
have
that
it
was...
it
resolved
a
compromise
between
the
senate,
which
had
taken
out
the
weapon
and
not
put
anything
in,
and
the
house,
which
did
not
take
out
the
weapon.
that's
how
matters
stood
when
this
went
to
conference.
they
both
were
adding
the
death
penalty
to
fatal
carjackings,
but...
actually,
another
indication--
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
--well,
i
would
say
you
could
go
to
the
jury
on
an
unconditional
intent
theory,
but
it
would
be
somewhat
unlikely
that
you
could
persuade
a
jury
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
that
the
person
had
an
unconditional
intent
to
kill
in
circumstances
in
which
it's...
which
he
didn't
in
fact
shoot
and
in
which
he
got
his...
in
which
he
got
the
car.
so
i
think
you
could
go
to
the
jury
on
that,
but
might
not
prevail.
what
we
went
to
the
jury
on
in
this...
the
government
went
to
the
jury
on
in
this
case
was
an
instruction
that
said,
if
you
find
that
he
intended
to
kill
or
inflict
serious
bodily
injury
if
necessary
to
effectuate
his
objectives,
that's
sufficient.
that's
what
we've
been
describing,
is
conditional
intent,
but
you
could
as
well
simply
describe
it
as
embraced
within
the
concept
of
intent,
and
that's
how
this
conviction
was
obtained.
i
want
to
say
something
about
the...
another
piece
of
evidence
about
what
congress
was
thinking
about,
since
that
question
was
asked,
is
that
originally
senator
lieberman
introduced
in
may
of
'93
a
provision
that
clearly
was
designed
to
do
two
separate
things...
this
was
before
the
omnibus
crime
bill...
to
add
the
death
penalty
to
fatal
carjackings,
and
to
remove
the
weapons
requirement
from
all
carjackings,
and
there
isn't
the
little
problem
about
which
section
number
is
being
modified
in
that
proposal.
a
few
months
later,
when
the
omnibus
crime
bill
was
in
the
congress,
in
the
senate,
and
there
was
a
long
list
of
crimes
to
which
the
death
penalty
was
to
be
added,
he
added
to
the
provision
that
said,
add
the
death
penalty
to
carjackings,
his
old
proposal
to
also
remove
the
weapons
requirement.
and
it
was
that
amendment
that
was
adopted
by
the
senate
and
ultimately
went
to
a
compromise.
the
house
simply
adopted
the...
didn't
have
that.
the
house
added
the
death
penalty
to
carjackings
but
didn't
fool
around
with
this
other
element.
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
i'm
not
suggesting
that
the
house
knew
all
that
background.
i
am
describing
where
it
came
from,
and
to
the
extent
we're
looking
for
an
indication
about
what
it
was
doing,
what
is
clear...
forget
intent
about
all
this
background...
is
that
the
intent
requirement
comes
in
as
a
substitute
for
the
weapons
requirement.
and
that,
i
think,
without
reading
anybody's
mind,
shows
that
it
was
designed
to
do
what
the
weapons
requirement
had
previously
done,
and
not
to
fix...
to
adapt
this
statute
for
death
penalty
purposes,
which
was
a
separate
project.
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
put
them
all
in.
i
mean,
made
them
all
criminal,
that's
right.
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
that's
right.
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
probably
not
a
water
pistol,
though.
i
guess
i'm
not
sure--
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
--perhaps.
i'm
not
sure.
in
new
york
state
law
a
firearm
has
to
be
loaded
to
qualify
as
a
firearm
in
a--
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
--that's
right.
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
that's
right.
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
quite
likely,
but
the
carjacking
with
a
pipe
or
with
a
knife
weren't,
and
so
that's
why
the
weapons
requirement
came
out,
and
then
there
was
the
search
for
some
compromise,
because
the
house
hadn't
removed
the
weapons
requirement
and
the
compromise
was
this
new
intent
requirement.
if
there
are
no
further
questions--
