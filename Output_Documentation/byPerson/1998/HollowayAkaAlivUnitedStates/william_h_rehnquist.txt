chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
number
97-7164,
francois
holloway
v.
the
united
states.
we'll
wait
just
a
minute,
mr.
keating.
mr.
keating.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
if--
--i
think
there's...
i
think
justice
o'connor's
question
is,
could
a
jury
find,
from
the
kind
of
evidence
she
referred
to,
could
they
infer
a
conditional
intent,
and
i
think
it's
very
difficult
to
say
they
couldn't.
they
might
well
choose
not
to.
it
seems
to
me
what
the
case
here
turns
on
is
what
is
the
meaning
of
the
statutory
intent,
not
what
a
jury
could
find
from
a
proper
charge.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
wasn't
part
of
it
so
as
to
make
someone
who
would
violate
this
eligible
for
the
death
penalty?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--we're
talking
about
what
congress
thought,
not
what
the
law
was.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
would
that
apply
here?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
we're
reviewing
the
court
of
appeals'
opinion.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
or
have
some
states
rejected
the
idea
of
conditional
intent?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
don't
you
file
it
later?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
here
the
debate
really
isn't
over
whether
there
was
a
specific
intent
to
kill,
because
there
was,
on
a
condition.
i
mean,
it
isn't
that
we're
talking
about
a
broader
intent,
but
a
specific
intent
to
kill,
but
it
was
not
unconditional.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
say
a
jury
could
not
find
the
intent
to
kill
from
the
facts
presented
here?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but...
oh,
you're
saying
after
the
vehicle
was
turned
over,
there
was
no
intent
to
kill.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you're
saying
they
couldn't
even...
they
couldn't
conclude
that
they
intended
to
kill
them
if
the
car
was
not
turned
over?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
we're
talking
not
about
kind
of
a
very
specific
intent
to
kill,
as
opposed
to
a
more
general
type
of
intent
to...
but
we're
talking
about
a
conditional
intent
of
a
very
specific
kind.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
keating.
ms.
underwood,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what
about,
you
enter
a
house
to
steal
a
tv
and
you
find
there's
no
tv
in
the
house.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
a
less
likely
one,
perhaps.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--how
about
the
dyer
act?
was
it
transported
interstate?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
it
has
to
be--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it
would
have
be
stolen,
then.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
ms.
underwood.
mr.
keating,
you
have
3
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
keating.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
97-7164,
holloway
against
united
states
will
be
announced
by
justice
stevens.
