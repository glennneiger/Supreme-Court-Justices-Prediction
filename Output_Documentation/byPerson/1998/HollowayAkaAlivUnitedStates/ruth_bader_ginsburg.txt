isn't
it,
mr.
keating,
more
than
that,
because
before
the
amendment,
when
the
statute
just
said,
in
possession
of
a
gun,
this
conduct
would
have
been
covered,
right?
justice
ruth
bader

so...
and
my
understanding
was
that
congress
was
responding
to
carjackings
that
involved
weapons
other
than
guns
and
wanted
to
take
out
the
gun
part
in
order
to
broaden,
not
narrow
the
reach
of
the
statute.
is
that
not
so?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it's
not
just
a
hypothetical.
i
mean,
it's
bluffing,
and
there
certainly
is
a
difference
between
somebody
who
says,
your
car
or
i'll
shoot,
and
has
a
loaded
gun,
and
somebody
who
has
a
toy
pistol.
in
the
latter
case
they're
intending
to
hijack
the
car
but
they're
not
going
to
shoot,
so
that
seems
to
me
is
a
line
that
comes
out
of
this
statute,
that
the
bluffer
doesn't
qualify,
but
the
one
who
says,
i
don't
want
to
do
it,
but
if
i
have
to
i
will,
does.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--the
example
that
the
chief
gave
i
think
is
more
in
line
with
the
distinction
you're
trying
to
draw,
and
it
is
the
explanation
in
the
model
penal
code
commentary.
that
is,
he
hopes
that
she
will
submit,
but
if
she
doesn't,
he
will
rape
her.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
government
would
have
to
prove
that
if
the
car
wasn't
turned
over,
that
the
defendant
in
fact
would
use--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--yes.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--but
there's
nothing
that
shows
that
congress
was
homing
in
on
the
difference
between
the
bluffer
and
the
one
who
says,
well,
if
i
have
to
do
it,
i
will.
