well,
yes,
but
that's
not
the
way
you
engage
in
carjacking.
anyone
who
did
that
would
not
only
be
a
carjacker
but
insane.
if
you
want
to
carjack,
you
point
a
gun
at
somebody
not
because
you
want
to
cause
him
death
or
a
serious
bodily
injury
but
because
you
want
the
car,
and
your
interpretation
would
reduce
the
ambit
of
this
statute
to
screwballs,
not
carjackers.
justice
david
h.
souter
wouldn't
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
you
may
not
even
have
to
go
that...
i
mean,
doesn't
the
model
penal
code
use
substantial
steps?
justice
david
h.
souter
and
i
suppose
if
you
take
the
gun
and
you
set
out
in
the
direction,
i
suppose
you've
taken
a
substantial
step,
haven't
you?
