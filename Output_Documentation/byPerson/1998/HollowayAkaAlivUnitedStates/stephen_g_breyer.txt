justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
you
say
never,
but
i
mean,
i
had
my
law
clerk
look
up
all
those
cites
in
the
government's
brief,
and
she
came
back
that
not
only
do
you
have
lafave,
you
have
such
conservative
things,
amjur,
you
have
about
15
state
cases,
and
the
model
penal
code
couldn't
be
more
explicit.
i
mean,
you
know,
when
a
particular
purpose
is
an
element
of
an
offense,
the
element
is
established,
although
such
purpose
is
conditional,
unless
the
condition
negatives
the
harm
or
evil.
i
mean,
so
cong...
i
agree
with
you
this
is
a
total
error
that
they
put
this
language
in
this
place.
i
think
they
did
want
to...
they
wanted
to
amend
section
3
on
the
death
penalty.
but
nonetheless
we
have
the
statute
in
front
of
us,
and
there
is
this
history,
so
what...
i
mean,
if
i've
looked
up
these
sources,
which
my
law
clerk
did,
lafave,
other
treatises,
the
model
penal
code,
10
cases,
all
of
which,
or
more,
which
read
it
that
way
is...
you've
done
a
heroic
job,
but
is
there
something
to
say
about
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
thought
that
you're
referring
now
to
2.02(2)(a)
small
(ii),
and
small
(ii)
refers
to
the
instance
well-known,
i
blow
up
the
coach
to
kill
the
king,
and
in
fact
the
footman
is
also
killed.
i
think,
you
know,
i
didn't
want
the
footman
to
be
killed,
but
i
knew
it
was
likely
to
happen.
i
think
that's
(2).
i
don't...
i
mean,
i
think
it's
as
easy
to
put
this
within
(1),
where
it's...
the
intent,
the
element
of
the
intent
is
part
of
the
nature
of
the
person's
conduct.
i
mean,
i
don't
think
it
fits...
i
thought
maybe
you
were
awash
on
that.
it's
a
wash.
it
could
go
in
(1),
it
could
go
in
(2),
and
then
they
have
the
very
explicit
thing
i
read.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
there
would,
actually.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--you
can
intimidate
somebody
by
saying,
your
money
or
your
life,
all
right,
and
you
point
the
gun
at
them,
but
you
know
the
gun
is
empty,
all
right.
that
person
would
have
satisfied
the
intimidation
element,
but
that
person
would
not
have...
you
know,
the
specific
intent
would
have
been
different.
that
person
wouldn't
satisfy
that.
they
wouldn't
satisfy
it
under
the
government's
reading.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
one
possibility
is
that
this
language
was
put
in
to
remove
from
the
statute
any
instance
in
which
the
offender
either
could
not
or
did
not
intend
to
carry
out
the
threat.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
the
other
possibility
is
that
this
language
appears
in
the
statute
because
congress,
in
committee,
thought
it
was
doing
what
it
says
up
here.
it
was
amending
21193,
namely
the
death
penalty
provision,
and
it
thought
that
it
had
to
put
this
intent
language
in
there
about
death,
anyway,
in
order
to
make
their
death
penalty
constitutional,
and
then
they
thought
for
good
measure
they'd
put
in
an
intent
to
do
a
seriously
bodily
harm,
and
then
they
wrote
language
that
amended
the
wrong
words
in
the
statute,
and
i
mean--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--there's
certainly
a
good
case
that
that's
what
happened.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
about
if
you
intend
to
go
to
the
super
bowl
if
the
patriots
are
in
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
can
you
say
anything--
