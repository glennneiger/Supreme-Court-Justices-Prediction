paul

may
i
just
interrupt
with
one
brief
question?
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
it
not
fairly
clear
that
they
took
the
word
firearm
out
because
they
wanted
to
include
additional
weapons?
justice
john
paul
stevens
why?
i
think
maybe
the
opposite,
because
if
this
had
been
a
problem,
it
would
have
come
up
in
hundreds
of
criminal
statutes,
and
it's
never
been
a
problem.
justice
john
paul
stevens
could
you
just
help
me?
which
is
the
casey
case
again?
i
don't
remember
that
one.
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
it
cited
in
your
brief?
justice
john
paul
stevens
oh.
do
you
have
the
citation?
justice
john
paul
stevens
was
it
a
criminal
case?
do
you
know
if
it
was
a
criminal
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
file
it
later,
then.
justice
john
paul
stevens
--may
i
just
follow...
your
position
is
that
even
if
we're
totally
convinced
that
congress
meant
the
statute
to
read
the
way
the
government
would
have
us
read
it,
we
should
nevertheless
reject
that
reading
because
the
plain
language
counsels
a
different
result.
justice
john
paul
stevens
your
view
is
that
even
if
each
of
us
is
totally
convinced
that
congress
intended
to
enact
the
statute
that
the...
reading
the
way
the
government
reads
it,
we
should
nevertheless
reject
that
construction
because
the
text
is
controlling.
justice
john
paul
stevens
of
course,
removing
the
weapons
requirement
removed
the
unloaded
gun
case
from
the
statute,
the
unloaded
gun,
water
pistol,
finger--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--it--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--well,
before,
they
would
have
been
criminal.
a
firearm...
you
can
have
an
unloaded
firearm.
you
would
have
been
guilty
of
carjacking
in
the
original--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--no,
but
an
unloaded
firearm.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
it's...
firearm
as
defined
in
section
921
of
a
federal
statute.
justice
john
paul
stevens
not
the
new
york
statute.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
i
would
think
such
a
firearm
would
make
it
a
carjacking
even
if
unloaded,
under
the
old
statute.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
why
isn't
it
a
conditional
intent,
intent
to
commit
rape
if
necessary?
justice
john
paul

entering
the
building.
justice
john
paul
stevens
if.
if
necessary.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
the
carjacker
has
a
presently-held
intention
to
do
future
harm
if
necessary.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
that's
what
the
jury
found.
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
necessary.
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
1994
the
congress
amended
the
federal
carjacking
statute
to
provide
that
“whoever
with
the
intent
to
cause
death
or
serious
bodily
harm,
takes
a
motor
vehicle”
from
another
person
by
force
and
violence
or
by
intimidation
shall
be
guilty
of
the
federal
crime.
the
question
in
this
case
is
one
of
the
concerns
the
meaning
of
that
definition
of
intent,
does
it
require
the
government
to
prove
that
the
defendant
had
an
unconditional
intent
to
kill
or
harm
in
all
events
or
does
it
just
require
proof
of
an
intent
to
kill
or
harm,
if
necessary
to
complete
the
carjacking?
the
petitioner
françois
holloway
and
an
accomplice
committed
three
carjackings.
they
approached
each
driver
produced
a
gun
and
threatened
to
shoot
unless
the
driver
handed
over
the
keys.
the
plan
was
to
steal
the
cars
without
harming
the
victims,
but
the
accomplice
testified
that
he
would
have
used
the
gun
if
any
of
the
drivers
had
given
him
a
hard
time.
at
trial
the
district
judge
instructed
the
jury
that
merely
using
a
gun
to
frighten
a
victim
was
insufficient
to
establish
an
attempt
to
cause
death
or
bodily
harm,
but
the
judge
continued
that
the
government
could
satisfy
this
element
if
it
established
that
the
defendant
intended
to
use
the
gun
to
cause
death
or
serious
harm
in
the
event
the
alleged
victim
refused
to
turnover
their
cars.
the
jury
convicted
petitioner
of
all
three
carjacking
counts.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit
affirmed.
we
granted
certiorari
to
resolve
an
apparent
conflict
between
that
decision
and
the
decision
of
the
ninth
circuit.
we
now
affirm.
congress
enacted
the
carjacking
statute
essentially
to
provide
a
federal
penalty
for
a
particular
type
of
robbery.
the
intended
element
of
that
statute
thus
modifies
the
act
of
taking
the
motor
vehicle.
we
think
that
when
a
person
points
a
gun
at
the
driver,
having
decided
to
pull
the
trigger
if
the
driver
does
not
comply
with
the
demands
of
the
car
keys,
the
person
posses
at
that
moment,
an
intent
to
seriously
harm
or
kill
the
driver
as
congress
intended
that
term
to
be
understood.
two
considerations
strongly
support
this
conclusion:
first
excluding
conditional
attempt
from
the
ambit
of
the
statute,
would
exclude
from
its
coverage
most
of
the
conduct
that
congress
obviously
intended
to
prohibit.
only
in
the
highly
unusual
carjacking
does
the
offender
intend
to
harm
or
kill
the
driver
regardless
of
whether
the
driver
resists.
second,
it
is
reasonable
to
presume
that
congress
was
familiar
with
the
cases
and
scholarly
writing
that
have
recognized
that
specific
intent
to
commit
a
wrongful
act
maybe
conditional.
justice
scalia
and
justice
thomas
have
filed
dissenting
opinions.
