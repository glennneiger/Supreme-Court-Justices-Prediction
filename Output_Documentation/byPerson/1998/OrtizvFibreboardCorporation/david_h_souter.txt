justice
david
h.
souter
this
case
comes
to
us
on
writ
of
certiorari
the
united
states
court
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit.
at
a
time
when
plaintiffs
were
filling
asbestos-related
personal
injury
claims
against
the
respondent
fibreboard.
fibreboard
was
suing
its
insurers
the
respondents
continental
casualty
company
and
pacific
indemnity
company
to
pay
the
claims.
in
1990,
fibreboard
won
the
suits
against
the
insurers
and
the
insurers
appealed.
while
the
appeal
was
pending
fibreboard
approached
to
group
of
asbestos
plaintiffs’
lawyers
and
eventually
settled
all
the
fibreboard’s
futures
asbestos
liability
in
an
agreement
called
a
global
settlement
agreement.
they
created
a
$1.535
billion
trust
to
pay
claimants
all
but
a
tiny
fraction
which
was
to
come
from
the
insurers.
as
agreed
a
group
of
named
plaintiffs’
then
filed
a
class
action
in
district
court
seeking
certification
of
the
settlement
only
non-opt-out
class
comprising
asbestos-related
tort
claimants
who
had
not
yet
sued
fibreboard,
claimants
who
had
settled
while
retaining
the
right
to
sue
in
the
future
for
an
asbestos-related
malignancy,
and
relegates
of
claimants.
the
district
court
certified
the
class
under
federal
rule
of
civil
procedure
23(b)(1)(b)
concluding
that
the
disputed
insurance
asset
liquidated
by
the
global
settlement
and
alternatively
fibreboard’s
equity
plus
the
value
of
its
insurance
coverage,
were
limited
funds.
over
petitioner's
objection,
the
district
court
approved
the
settlement
as
fair.
the
fifth
circuit
affirmed
approving
the
settlement,
the
certification
on
a
limited
fund
rationale.
we
vacated
that
judgment
in
light
of
our
decision
in
amchem
products
incorporated
v.
windsor,
when
on
remand
the
fifth
circuit
again
affirmed.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
a
clerk
of
court
today,
we
reverse.
rule
23(b)(1)(b)
provides
the
certification
of
a
class
whose
members
have
no
right
to
withdraw,
when
the
prosecution
of
separate
actions
would
create
a
risk
of
adjudications
with
respect
to
individual
class
members
which
would
as
a
practical
matter
be
dispositive
of
the
interests
of
absent
members
was
substantially
impair
or
impede
their
ability
to
protect
their
interests.
the
risk
that
the
rule
refers
to
is
understood
to
the
present
in
cases
where
there
is
only
a
so-called
limited
fund.
where
limited
fund
class
actions
have
traditionally
been
recognized
there
has
been
a
fund
inadequate
to
pay
all
claims
against
it.
all
persons
would
claims
based
on
common
theory
of
liability
have
been
included
within
the
class
and
all
of
the
fund
has
been
distributed
to
satisfy
all
those
claims
on
an
equitable
pro
rata
basis.
these
historical
characteristics
we
hold
are
presumptively
necessary
to
justify
mandatory
class
treatment
on
the
limited
fund
theory
relied
upon
by
the
court
of
appeals.
this
view
finds
support
and
the
understanding
by
the
advisory
committee
that
propose
rule
23,
it
minimizes
conflict
with
the
rules
enabling
act
and
it
avoids
constitutional
concerns.
the
record
here
did
not
show
that
the
three
essential
conditions
for
a
mandatory
limited
fund
class
action
were
satisfied.
firstly,
was
no
adequate
demonstration
of
the
funds
limit,
hence
instead
of
the
independently
evaluating
the
disputed
insurance
coverage
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
simply
accepted
the
parties
agreed
upon
figure.
it
may
well
be,
the
settlement
figure
is
never
sufficient
alone
to
demonstrate
a
limited
fund
but
it
clearly
is
insufficient
here,
due
to
conflicts
on
the
part
of
some
counsel
in
this
case.
some
of
the
same
lawyers
representing
the
class
also
negotiated
a
separate
settlement
agreement
covering
45000
pending
claims,
full
payment
of
which
depended
impart
on
a
successful
global
settlement.
class
counsel
thus
had
great
incentive
to
reach
any
global
settlement
that
might
survive
a
rule
23(e)
fairness
hearing
rather
than
the
best
arrangement
for
their
class
clients.
next,
the
settlement
certification
fell
short
with
respect
to
the
inclusiveness
of
the
class
and
fairness
of
distribution
within
it.
the
class
excluded
myriad
claimants
with
causes
of
action,
or
foreseeable
causes
of
action
arising
from
exposure
to
fibreboard
asbestos,
and
the
district
court
failed
to
insure
fairness
of
the
funds
distribution
among
class
members
as
it
could
only
have
done
by
certifying
sub-classes
as
required
by
our
decision
in
amchem.
at
the
least
there
should
have
been
separate
representation
for
holders
of
present
claims
and
future
claims,
as
well
as
for
those
exposed
to
fibreboard’s
asbestos
products
before
and
after
the
expiration
of
the
bulk
of
fibreboard’s
insurance
coverage.
finally,
this
class
action
departs
markedly
from
the
limited
fund
antecedents
in
its
provision
for
a
fund
smaller
than
the
assets
understood
to
be
available
for
payment
of
the
class
members
claims.
fibreboard
listed
its
entire
net
worth
as
a
component
of
the
total
and
allegedly
inadequate
assets
available,
yet
it
retained
all
but
a
half
a
million
dollars
of
that
equity
for
itself.
it
hardly
appeared
that
such
a
regime
was
the
best
that
could
be
provided
for
class
members.
the
chief
justice
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion
which
justice
scalia
and
justice
kennedy

joined;
justice
breyer

dissenting
opinion
