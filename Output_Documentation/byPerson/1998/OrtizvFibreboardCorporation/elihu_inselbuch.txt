mr.
elihu
inselbuch
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
no
matter
how
he
protests,
this
is
not
the
amchem
case.
though
he
says
all
of
the
facts
are
imaginary,
they're
not
imaginary.
the
principle
issue,
the
one
common
issue
that
needed
to
be
resolved
here,
was
whether
or
not
there
would
be
any
insurance
proceeds
at
all.
mr.
elihu
inselbuch
they
certainly
would
have
standing
to
find
out
whether
or
not
there
would
be
coverage
if,
but
for
their
presence,
the
coverage
issue
would
be
decided
without
them.
that's
the
teaching
of
the
shapiro
case
in
california.
now,
it
would
be
ironic,
i
submit,
that
if
the
very
trigger
issue--
mr.
elihu
inselbuch
--i
think
that
if
you
are
a
potential
claimant
against
an
insurance
company
and
if
there
is
an
ongoing
issue
about
whether
or
not
there
will
be
coverage
and
if
but
for
that
coverage
there
is
no
other
alternative
for
your
recovery,
and
if
that
issue
is
going
to
be
decided
in
any
event,
with
you
or
without
you,
it
would
turn
standing
on
its
head
and
it
would
turn
due
process
on
its
head
to
say,
you
cannot
come
here
and
participate
in
that
resolution.
mr.
elihu
inselbuch
but
that's
why
you
have
rule
23(b)(1)(b)
when
there
is
a
risk
as
a
practical
matter
that
they
will
be
or
their
interests
will
no
longer
be
available
to
them
to
protect.
think
of
the
duke
power
case,
where
all
you
had
at
duke
power
was
exposure
to
radiation,
but
you
let
people
still
challenge,
challenge
whether
or
not
their
rights
to
collect
if
they
got
sick
later
would
be
available.
mr.
elihu
inselbuch
with
all
due
respect,
this
is
not
a
mass
tort
case.
it
is
a
resolution
of
the
issue
of
whether
or
not
these
people
will
ever
get
paid
under
one
policy,
with
one
set
of
facts
and
one
body
of
law
applicable
equally
to
all
of
them.
and
that's
what
the
rule
is
there
designed,
because
sooner
or
later
that
issue
would
be
litigated
by...
either
in
the
insurance
case
in
part
in
california
or
by
individual
members
of
this
class
who
would
test
whether
or
not
there
was
coverage
notwithstanding
the
claim
by
the
insurance
company
that
the
assignment
program
fibreboard
entered
into
vitiated
coverage.
sooner
or
later.
mr.
elihu
inselbuch
the
class
members
all
had
claims,
potential
claims
for
personal
injuries
against
fibreboard.
fibreboard
and
its
insurance
company
were
in
a
death
struggle
over
whether
there
was
coverage.
if
there
was
no
coverage,
these
class
members
would
recover
nothing
at
all.
mr.
elihu
inselbuch
the
class
members'
pleading
was
against
fibreboard.
simultaneous
with
the
filing
of
that
pleading,
the
insurers
intervened
on
the
coverage
issues,
so
that
all
the
pleadings
presented
all
of
the
issues.
my
learned
opponent--
mr.
elihu
inselbuch
--there
was
pending
litigation
over
coverage
in
the
same
district
court
between
fibreboard
and
a
group
of
prior
settled
asbestos
claimants
and
its
insurance
companies.
there
were
two
cases
pending
that
were
testing
both
whether
there
was
ability
by
fibreboard
to
assign
coverage
and
whether
or
not
it
could
obtain
coverage
from
one
of
the
insurance
companies
and
free
another
insurer
from
a
claim
over
for
equitable
contribution.
but
all
of
those
coverage
cases
did
not
really
plead
yet,
did
not
really
bring
the
last
issue
before
any
court,
which
some
class
member
would
sooner
or
later
bring
when
it
brought
a
judgment,
as
justice
scalia
says,
to
the
insurer,
of
whether
or
not
the
conduct
engaged
in
by
fibreboard
vitiated
the
coverage.
sooner
or
later,
sooner
or
later,
one
or
another
of
these
cases
would
have
decided
all
of
these
insurance
coverage
issues,
and
if
the
class
members
weren't
there
they
would
have
been
at
some
risk
that
as
a
practical
matter,
as
the
rule
says,
the
issues
would
be
decided,
they
would
not
be
able
to
protect
their
interests.
that's
what
this
case
is
about.
this
is
not
a
mass
tort
case,
this
is
not
an
end
run
around
amchem,
and
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
amchem.
now,
to
get
there--
mr.
elihu
inselbuch
--this
case
could
not
have
been
brought
as
a
(b)(3)
action.
there
was
a
common
issue
that
required
a
unitary
resolution,
the
very
reason
why
(b)(1)(a),
(b)(2),
(b)(1)(b),
and
(b)(2)
came
out
of
the
common
law,
out
of
equity
pleading.
mr.
elihu
inselbuch
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
defendant's
desires
or
the
insurer's
desires.
it
has
to
do
with
the
position
the
class
was
in.
if
you
have
a
situation
as
unique
as
this
is,
where
without
coverage,
there
is
no
opportunity
for
coverage
and
there
is
a
real--
mr.
elihu
inselbuch
--fibreboard
was
in
litigation
since
1979
over
this
insurance
issue
with
its
insurers.
until
approximately
1989
or
1990,
that
dispute
didn't
reach
the
radar
screen
of
the
plaintiffs
because
fibreboard
had
other
insurance
and
was
paying
its
claims.
once
that
issue
reached
the
radar
screen,
the
discussions
began
of
how
to
get
this
matter
resolved.
mr.
elihu
inselbuch
plaintiffs'
claims
in
asbestos
are
like
an
unrolling
carpet.
at
any
moment
in
time
some
are
filed,
some
are
resolved,
and
some
are
yet
to
come.
it's
an
accident
of
history
where
you
happen
to
be
when
you
make
a
resolution.
in
fact,
when
you
got
to
august
27th
of
1993,
when
this
settlement
was
reached,
the
prior
claims
had
already
been
settled
as
between
fibreboard
and
the
insurer
and
the
plaintiffs
on
the
basis
where
they
would
be
paid,
they
were
paid
50
percent
in
advance,
and
they
would
get
the
rest
if
there
was
a
coverage
case
success,
if
there
was
a
bilateral
resolution
between
fibreboard
and
its
insurers,
or
if
there
was
a
global
like
this.
that
was
gone.
but
there
is
no
artificial
way
you
can
talk
about
the
past
and
the
present
and
the
future
plaintiffs.
there
is
no
fine
line
to
divide
that.
as
judge
higginbotham
advised
the
counsel
who
were
trying
to
negotiate
this:
do
the
best
you
can.
you're
trying
to
resolve
too
difficult
a
problem.
carve
it
up
into
pieces.
settle
the
present
ones
first
because
they
involve
present
people
with
existing
lawyers
in
existing
tort
cases.
mr.
elihu
inselbuch
the
reason
why
the
settlement
was
entered
into
was
to
resolve
the
insurance
dispute.
no
matter
how
many
times
mr.
tribe
will
tell
you
that
this
is
the
amchem
case
and
no
matter
how
many
times
i
am
asked
about
it--
mr.
elihu
inselbuch
--i
beg
your
pardon.
then
i
don't
understand
the
question.
mr.
elihu
inselbuch
let
me
try
it
this
way.
but
for
this
settlement,
but
for
any
settlement
here,
each
one
of
these
class
members
as
his
case
or
her
case
unfolded
would
bring
a
tort
case,
a
tort
case
for
personal
injuries
against
fibreboard.
and
if
they
were
successful
in
that
case,
then
they
would
be
entitled
under
the
theories
presented
to
pursue
the
insurance
litigation
individually
to
see
whether
or
not
there
would
be
any
payment
for
the
tort
judgment
that
they
received.
now,
yes,
they
would
have
a
right
to
do
that.
but
sooner
or
later
that
insurance
case
would
be
decided
one
way
or
the
other.
now,
if
they
were
successful
that
would
be
fine.
then
there
would
be
effectively,
within
the
limits
of
the
policy
itself,
coverage
over
the
years
for
all
of
these
tort
victims.
but
if
it
were
decided
against
them
and
that
decision
ultimately
were
decided
by
the
supreme
court
of
california,
the
rest
of
these
tort
victims,
while
they
might
still
have
retained
their
entitlement
to
bring
these
individual
tort
cases
in
the
system,
would
have
had
a
futile
act
to
bring.
because
there
would
have
had
no
coverage,
that
interest
they
would
have
had
in
securing
coverage
in
the
insurance
dispute
would
have
been
taken
from
them.
that
would
have
been
decided.
their
interest
would
be
gone.
and
that's
what
this
case
is
about.
this
case
is
about
whether
or
not
a
class
of
people
facing
a
common
risk,
a
common
interest
in
an
insurance
dispute,
can
bind
together
in
order
to
assert
their
interests
in
the
resolution
of
that
dispute.
mr.
elihu
inselbuch
i
think
you've
asked
me
several
questions.
mr.
elihu
inselbuch
let
me
try
them
one
at
a
time.
first,
yes,
members
of
this
class
may
yet
be
unborn,
but
if
i
am
correct,
if
i
am
correct
that
there
was
a
need
to
resolve
a
common
issue
on
a
unitary
basis,
that
doesn't
preclude
the
inclusion
in
the
class
and
binding
through
the
class
action
mechanism
of
futures.
this
court
has
on
a
number
of
occasions
approved
such
certifications.
the
murray
case
in
1989,
the
class
was
all
present
and
future
virginia
death
row
inmates
who
cannot
afford
lawyers.
well,
some
of
those
inmates
haven't
even
committed
their
crimes
yet.
yet
they
were
going
to
be
included
in
the
class
and
bound.
mr.
elihu
inselbuch
i
submit
that
they
come
from
the
same
evolution
of
the
bill
of
peace.
and
if
you
want
to
think
of
tort
damage
claims
resolved
unilaterally
against
the
whole
class,
although
it
doesn't
meet
justice
o'connor's
point
of
unborns
or
futures,
think
of
the
mullane
case.
the
mullane
case
was
a
case,
was
a
classic
bill
of
peace,
where
a
bank
that
ran
common
trust
funds
sought
in
one
court
to
stay
or
stop
or
cut
off
any
claims
for
negligence,
fraud,
waste,
against
all
beneficiaries
of
these
trusts
based
on
the
same
set
of
facts
and
the
same
operative
law.
in
mullane
there
were
no
opt-outs.
mr.
elihu
inselbuch
yes.
mr.
elihu
inselbuch
well,
first
of
all,
the
issue
in
mullane
was
not
whether
i
have
an
interest
in
collecting
a
small
amount
from
a
common
fund.
it
was
a
test
of
whether
or
not
the
people
who
managed
the
fund
had
committed
negligent
torts.
mr.
elihu
inselbuch
yes.
mr.
elihu
inselbuch
right.
and
if
you
don't
have
a
decision
under
one
insurance
policy
about
whether
there's
coverage,
you
won't
have
any
payment
for
any
of
these
claims.
now,
how
can
that
be
any
different?
surely
when
there
are
common
claims
involved
there
has
to
be
some
nexus
for
there
to
be
common
claims.
mr.
elihu
inselbuch
well,
i
was
there
and
i
think,
as
the
record
reflects,
surely
fibreboard
had
an
interest
in
getting
the
case
resolved.
the
genesis
of
the
discussions
were
here
in
washington
at
the
dolly
madison
house,
as
the
record
reflects,
where
were
gathered
plaintiffs'
lawyers,
defendants'
lawyers,
insurance
company
lawyers,
to
discuss
what
to
do
about
asbestos
litigation.
those
lawyers
met
together
and
out
of
that
discussion
the
lawyers
for
fibreboard
picked
up
the
phone
and
called
some
of
the
plaintiffs'
lawyers
that
they
had
talked
to
at
that
meeting
and
said:
let's
talk
about
this
problem.
does
it
really
matter
who
made
the
first
phone
call?
we
struggled
with
this
problem
on
behalf
of
the
victims
on
the
one
side,
fibreboard's
lawyers
on
the
other
side,
the
insurance
companies'
lawyers
finally
on
the
third
side.
i'd
like
to
respond
to
what
i
regard
to
be
an
unfair
comment
that
mr.
tribe
has
made
about
how
the
plaintiffs'
lawyers
were
willing
to
go
to
a
(b)(1)(b)
class
when
there
was
more
money
on
the
table.
when
we
were
negotiating
with
just
fibreboard,
with
just
fibreboard
and
before
amchem
had
been
decided,
what
we
contemplated
was
a
settlement,
a
mass
tort
settlement
on
an
assignment
basis,
with
just
fibreboard.
mr.
elihu
inselbuch
the
plaintiffs,
the
plaintiffs...
no,
the
plaintiffs
and
fibreboard.
the
two
years
of
negotiations
before
the
insurance
companies
came
to
the
table
were
all
premised
on
the
notion
that
we
would
have
a
mass
tort
(b)(3)
settlement
assigning
fibreboard's
interest
in
the
policy
from
the
insurance
company.
the
insurance
company
wasn't
at
the
table.
there
was
no
unitary
issue
to
resolve.
we
weren't
resolving
or
discussing
resolving
the
insurance
issues.
but
once
the
insurance
company
came
to
the
table,
as
my
colleague
mr.
kazan
said,
and
brought
their
checkbook,
yes.
now
we
were
there
to
resolve
a
unitary
issue,
whether
or
not
there
was
coverage,
whether
we
could
settle
that
question.
mr.
elihu
inselbuch
well,
getting
paid
seems
to
be
the
most
important
overriding
issue
to
any
plaintiff.
mr.
elihu
inselbuch
the
rule,
the
language
of
the
rule,
the
text
of
the
rule,
talks
about
a
common
interest
where
you're
going
to
put
at
risk
as
a
practical
matter
the
individuals'
ability
to
protect
their
interests.
i
submit,
justice
scalia,
that
the
most
important
interest
that
these
class
members
had
was
whether
or
not
they
would
get
paid.
mr.
elihu
inselbuch
it
doesn't
even...
the
rule
doesn't
even
require
that,
you're
quite
correct.
it
just
says
where
there
is
a
risk
as
a
practical
matter
that
the
prosecution
of
separate
actions
will
be
dispositive
of
the
interests
of
the
class
members
or
substantially
impair
or
impede
their
ability
to
protect
their
interests.
that's
what
the
rule
says,
and
that
certainly
was
the
fact
here,
because
if
the
litigation
had
continued
and
the
insurance
issues
were
decided
then
the
remainder
of
the
class
members
would
not
have
been
able
to
protect
what
had
to
have
been
their
most
important
interest,
their
interest
in
getting
paid.
surely
there
were
differences
among,
among
their
claims,
and
we
did
our
best
once
we
resolved
the
insurance
issue
in
crafting
a
settlement
that
left
each
of
the
individual
class
members
with
the
ability
to
resolve
those
on
an
individual
basis.
mr.
elihu
inselbuch
yes.
yes,
the
manville
case
for
example,
in
the
second
circuit.
you
wouldn't
be
cutting
off
the
claims.
mr.
elihu
inselbuch
you
would
require
that
they
all
take
an
equal
hair
cut.
mr.
elihu
inselbuch
i
think
where
you
have
a
true
limited
fund
you
have
in
rem
jurisdiction
and
you
have
a
res
to
deal
with,
i
don't
think
these
issues
would
arise.
i
think...
but
this
is...
of
course,
we
don't
argue
that
this
is
a
limited
fund.
we
argue
that
we
are
quite
within
the
rule
because
of
the
risk
of
the
individual
litigations
or
the
risk
that
they
would
bring
to
bear
to
the
rest
of
the
class.
mr.
elihu
inselbuch
well,
the
history
of
the
bill
of
peace,
of
the
representative
lawsuits
that
grew
out
of
the
bill
of
peace,
was
that
you
have
to
balance,
that
the
courts
have
to
balance
different
interests.
certainly
at
common
law
and
in
the
jurisprudence
of
this
country,
there
is
an
interest
that
only
those
before
the
court
and
properly
before
the
court,
where
the
court
has
jurisdiction
over
them,
can
be
bound
by
the
decree
of
the
court.
but
what
we
learned
in
the
eighteenth
century
and
what
justice
story
reports
in
his
treatise
and
what
professor
chaffee
recounts
is
that
where
there
was
the
fact
that
either
through
numerocity
or
because
people
were
not
subject
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court,
you
couldn't
bring
all
the
parties
before
the
court,
but
yet
if
you
didn't
resolve
the
issue
you
would
create
difficulties
or
burdens
or
problems
or
penalties
or
unfairness,
then
in
a
proper
case
where
a
court
would
balance
those
issues,
then
you
would
have
a
class
action
or
what
they
called
a
bill
of
peace
or
a
common
action
or
whatever
the
names
were
for
it
then,
and
in
fact
if
you
had
adequate
representatives
they
would
bind
all
of
the
members
of
the
class
irrespective
of
where
they
were.
mr.
elihu
inselbuch
it's
not
a
question
of
how
good
the
deal
is.
it's
a
question
of
whether
or
not...
which
is
the
dog
and
which
is
the
tail.
the
dog
here
was
the
issue
of
whether
or
not
there
was
insurance
coverage.
now,
in
any...
even
in
the
common
fund
case,
the
individual
shares
may
differ
or
the
rights
to
individual
shares
might
differ.
but
the
need
to
create
the
haircut
in
the
common
fund
case
for
every
claimant
is
needed.
here
there
was
a
need
to
resolve
whether
or
not
there
would
be
any
money
for
these
people,
and
they
were
all
interested
in
having
that
resolved.
mr.
elihu
inselbuch
no,
they
did
not.
they
did
not
settle
it.
it
was
only
when
the
class
stepped
and
there
was
a
three-way
settlement
that
any
settlement
ever
eventuated,
this
settlement.
there
was
never
a
settlement
first
between
fibreboard
and
its
insurers.
mr.
elihu
inselbuch
the
class.
mr.
elihu
inselbuch
no.
that
litigation
wasn't
stayed
as
with
respect
to
the
fibreboard
issues
until
this
settlement
was
reached
and
was
spread
on
the
record
in
the
district
court
in
texas,
at
which
point
the
parties
wrote
to
the
court
in
california.
mr.
elihu
inselbuch
ultimately,
the
decisions
on
trigger
and
scope,
which
we
were
terrified
would
be
reversed
by
the
supreme
court
of
california,
were
affirmed
by
the
california
appellate
court.
mr.
elihu
inselbuch
no,
not
necessarily,
because
there
was
still
a
very
important
question
that
the
insurance
companies
raise
about
whether
fibreboard's
practice
of
settling
cases
with
plaintiffs,
billions
of
dollars
worth
of
settlements
with
plaintiffs,
on
an
assignment
basis
under
the
policy
was
in
breach
of
the
policy,
which
an
intermediate
court
in
california,
incidentally,
after
the
settlement
was
reached,
held
that
it
was.
what
were
the
consequences
of
that?
the
insurer
would
argue
next
that
vitiated
the
very
coverage
that
the
court
of
appeals
approved.
and
those
issues
were
yet
to
be
litigated
and
were
percolating
along,
and
if
all
of
these
insurance
issues
had
not
been
resolved
in
this
unitary
way
sooner
or
later
they
would
have
been
resolved
in
one
case
or
another
on
a
litigated
basis.
an
that
litigated
basis,
as
the
testimony
showed
in
the
district
court,
put
these
people
at
an
enormous
risk
that
it
would
be
resolved
against
them
in
some
substantive
way
and
the
result
then
would
have
been
that,
yes,
they
would
have
had
their
individual
tort
claims,
but
they
never
would
have
been
able
to
recover
any
damages.
in
my
remaining
minutes,
let
me
talk
just
a
bit
about
the
common
law,
because
professor
tribe
suggests
that
under
the
old
cases
you
had
to
have
an
in
rem,
a
res
of
some
kind,
and
that
is
not
what
those
cases
stand
for.
if
you
go
back
and
look
at
cases
like
lee
against
thomas
in
1751,
chancey
against
may
in
1722,
where
there
was
a
bill
of
peace,
a
representative
bill
of
peace
to
recover
for
embezzlement
damages,
the
adair
case,
whether
a
rent
charge
on
the
profits
would
bear
an
assessment
or
would
not
bear
an
assessment,
these
were
not
cases
where
the
litigants
were
seeking
an
interest
in
a
res
or
in
a
common
property.
what
developed
in
equity
was
not
just
related
to
equitable
claims,
but
people
came
to
the
court
in
equity
and
said:
we
have
all
of
these
cases,
some
of
them
may
be
at
law,
some
of
them
may
be
in
equity,
but
we
don't
need
to
proliferate
all
of
these
cases.
we're
being
buried
by
them.
let's
resolve
them
all
in
one
place.
the
bill
of
peace
started
not
on
a
representative
basis,
but
to
bind
all
the
members
of
the
so-called,
according
to
professor
chaffee,
the
multitude.
mr.
elihu
inselbuch
in
our
case?
mr.
elihu
inselbuch
in
the
older
cases--
mr.
elihu
inselbuch
--that
i've
read,
i
don't
see
descriptions
of
settlements.
they're
litigated
solutions
and
reported
in
the
law
books.
i
have
not...
i
don't
recall
anyone
that
discusses
a
settlement.
