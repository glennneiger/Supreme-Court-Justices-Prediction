unknown
speaker
mr.
tribe,
i
thought
that
the
fifth
circuit
on
remand
said
the
big
difference
was
that
amchem
was
certified
under
(b)(3),
and
this
was
a
nonopt-out
(b)(1)(b).
unknown
speaker
well,
mr.
tribe,
you
talk
about
how
badly
these
people
are
going
to
fare
under
the...
but
how
well
are
they
going
to
fare
if
they
just
keep
fighting
their
individual
lawsuits?
unknown
speaker
well,
but
you
pointed
out
that
the
people
are
left...
even
when
they
finally
go
to
court
it's
a
cap
on
damages
and
that
sort
of
thing,
but
don't
you
have
to
compare
that
with
what
their
fate
would
be
if
they
simply
keep
suing
fiberboard
and
it
ends
up
in
bankruptcy?
unknown
speaker
mr.
tribe,
would
you
help
me
out
on
one
thing?
i
couldn't
tell
from
your
brief
whom
you
actually
represent.
who
are
your
clients,
and
where
do
they
fit
in
the
whole
picture?
unknown
speaker
and
how
many
of
them
are
there?
unknown
speaker
they
are
all
people
who
were
exposed?
unknown
speaker
so
they're
not
members
of
those
who
are
not
exposed--
unknown
speaker
--how
many
of
them
are
there?
how
many
intervened?
unknown
speaker
five
intervenors,
and
are
they
people
who
question
the
jurisdiction,
also,
or
are
they--
unknown
speaker
--where
are
they
from?
unknown
speaker
mr.
tribe,
you
indicated
that
assuming
there
was
adequate
representation
you
thought
that
a
class
action
might
well
be
possible
here.
unknown
speaker
under
(b)(1)(b),
then
i'm
confused,
because
i
thought
it
was
your
position,
no
matter
how
fair
the
settlement,
no
matter
how
good
it
is
for
the
greatest
number,
(b)(1)(b)
simply
is
not
available
for
a
mass
tort
action
which
consolidates
or,
in
your
words,
collectivizes
many
injured
and
potentially
injured
people.
i
thought
your
position
was
that's
not
the
office
of
(b)(1)(b).
unknown
speaker
i
want
to
ask
you
on
the
first
question,
you're
basically
saying
that
the
lawyers
shouldn't
have
represented
their
own
existing
clients
and
also
the
class
of
futures.
unknown
speaker
so
in
respect
to
both,
i
take
it
judge
parker,
who's
a
pretty
experienced
trial
judge,
looked
at
it
and
said,
we
have
to
act
fairly
quickly.
these
lawyers
are
very
experienced.
we
have
to
get
this
particular
group
of
lawyers
or
we
won't
be
able
to
do
the
job,
and
i
look
at
both
sides
of
this
and
i
make
a
balance
here,
and
my
balance
is
that
they
ought
to
go
ahead
with
this.
unknown
speaker
now,
what
are
we
supposed
to
do?
unknown
speaker
are
we
supposed
to
go
and
read
the
whole
record
in
this
and--
unknown
speaker
--say
judge
parker
was
wrong,
or
what?
unknown
speaker
my
problem
is,
not
having
read
your
briefs
on
this
and
the
other
side,
i
don't
see
how
i
could
make
a
judgment
as
to
whether
judge
parker
was
right
or
wrong
in
his
weighing
of
several
factors
to
come
to
the
conclusion
that
the
representation
was
okay,
without
familiarizing
myself
in
great
depth
with
the
details
of
this
case.
unknown
speaker
if
you
see
an
easier
way...
maybe
i'm
supposed
to
do
that.
unknown
speaker
yes.
maybe
i'm
supposed--
unknown
speaker
--are
you
talking
about
representation
in
terms
of
attorneys,
or
in
terms
of
class
members?
unknown
speaker
the
rule--
unknown
speaker
--rule
23
says
nothing
about
attorneys.
unknown
speaker
mr.
tribe,
i
would,
because
your
time
is
running,
like
you
to
get
to
the
point
of--
unknown
speaker
--yes,
because--
unknown
speaker
--if
you
can't
certify
under
(b)(1)(b),
all
the
rest
of
it
is
beside
the
point.
unknown
speaker
well,
what
if
the
corporate
assets,
the
bulk
of
them
were
put
into
the
mix,
and
there
it
is.
that's
all
there
is,
folks.
unknown
speaker
could
that
not
meet
the
rather
loose
language
of
(b)(1)(b)?
unknown
speaker
i
know.
i'm
just
asking
you
whether
you
can
envision
a
situation
where
substantially
all
the
assets
of
the
company
are
put
into
it
and
here
it
is.
that's
all
there
is.
unknown
speaker
not
yet
in
bankruptcy.
no.
unknown
speaker
maybe
there's--
unknown
speaker
--the
will
that
remains
so
that
the
company
could
somehow
string
it
out
and
stay
in
business.
unknown
speaker
but
the
language
of
the
rule
doesn't
seem
to
foreclose
that
notion.
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
that--
unknown
speaker
--would
you
recognize
the
possibility
that
in
personam
rights
could
be
determined
under
a
(b)(1)(b)
settlement?
unknown
speaker
you
could
use
it
for
beneficiaries
of
a
trust
fund,
i
take
it.
unknown
speaker
mr.
tribe,
may
i--
unknown
speaker
--may
i...
do
i
understand
correctly
that
your
position
on
(b)(1)(b)
is
that
you
simply
cannot
have
in
any
case
where
the
stand-alone
claim
would
be
for
tort
damages,
you
cannot
have
a
(b)(1)(b)
action,
maybe
(b)(3),
but
are
there
any
circumstances
in
which
tortfeasors...
a
tortfeasor
could
gather
together
injured
and
potentially
injured
people
whose
stand-alone
claims
would
be
for
tort
damages
and
place
them
in
a
(b)(1)(b)?
is
there
any
such
claim?
unknown
speaker
suppose
an
insurance
company
paid
the
full
amounts
of
its
policy
and
say,
we're
paying
the
full
amount
in,
we'll
walk
away,
could
that
be
subject
to
a
(b)(1)(b)?
unknown
speaker
the
insurance
company
pays
the
full
limits
of
the
policy.
they
say,
we
want
out
of
this,
and
we
paid
into
a
fund,
and
subject
to
class
action
disposition
under
(b)(1)(b).
unknown
speaker
no,
i'm
just
testing
the
limits
of
(b)(1)(b).
could...
suppose
the
insurance
company
pays
the
full
limits.
that's
all
there
is.
the
money's
there.
unknown
speaker
but
in
my
hypothetical
that's
all
the
money
there
is.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
because
there
are
individual
tort
rights
that
are
in
personam,
not
in
rem?
unknown
speaker
we
wouldn't
have
to
go
that
far
for
you
to
win,
though--
unknown
speaker
--i
take
it,
in
this
case.
unknown
speaker
you
pointed
out
that
it's
not
against
the
insurance
company.
fibreboard
is
the
defendant.
well,
suppose
there
should
be
a
bankruptcy.
how
do
these
claims
play
out
in
bankruptcy.
you
said
that
there's
legislation
on...
what
would
happen
to
these
future
claims
that
don't
yet
exist,
or--
unknown
speaker
--is
that
like
the
johns-manville--
unknown
speaker
--why
equitable?
i
mean,
from
that
perspective
you
have...
if
you
have
thousands
and
thousands
of
people
who
are
hurt,
and
the
only
apparent
way
to
get
those
people
compensated
is
to
have
a
system
where
you
get
a
fund
so
that
it's
equitably
distributed
across
everyone
who's
hurt,
rather
than
a
few
people
running
off
with
most
of
it,
why
do
you
have
to
force
a
company
into
bankruptcy
in
order
to
get
that
result?
unknown
speaker
well,
you're
saying
the
only
way
that
could
happen
is
bankruptcy,
but
in
fact,
it
wouldn't
have
to
happen
in
bankruptcy
if
what
we
were
going
against
was
a
trust,
or
what
we
were
going
against
was
a
ship,
and
so
why,
if
we
can
go
against
a
ship
and
we
can
go
against
a
trust
and
get
this
equitable
result,
why
can't
we
go
against
this
fund
as
long
as
it
complies
with
the
literal
words
of
the
rule?
unknown
speaker
i
agree
with
you
that
this
is
not
your
normal
situation.
it's
an
unusual
one.
i
agree
with
you
about
that.
but
is
there
some
basic
or
fundamental
principle
of
fairness
or
underlying
law
that
this
violates
because
of
its
unusual
nature
when
it
complies
with
the
words?
unknown
speaker
mr.
tribe--
--assume--
--i
thought
the
fundamental
principle
of
fairness
it
violated
was
first
come,
first
served.
why
do
you
accept
that
that's
not
fair?
that's
the
general
rule
we've
always
applied
in
the
common
law.
unknown
speaker
whoever
sues
first
and
gets
his
judgment
first
gets
his
money,
and
someone
who
sues
later
doesn't
get
money,
and
you
accept
that
that
is
unfair?
unknown
speaker
it's
the
way
we've
always
done
things,
and
unless
these
rules
allow
us
to
do
it
differently
i
don't
know
that
we
can--
unknown
speaker
--pronounce
that
that
is
unfair
and
can
therefore
be
avoided.
unknown
speaker
but
there's
one
part
of
it
that
you
seem
to
agree
can
be
done,
and
i
believe
that
justice
breyer
wrote
an
opinion
in
metro
north
sometime
ago
that
said
that
people
who
are
merely
exposed
do
not
have
a
claim
under
the
fela,
and
cited
in
support
of
that
the
common
law
of
many
states.
well,
if
that's
right,
then
these
future
people
who
have
been
exposed
but
not
yet
afflicted
in
any
way,
simply
don't
have
any
claim
yet.
unknown
speaker
but
you
didn't
object,
then...
yes,
well--
unknown
speaker
--i
thought
they
do
have
a
claim
under
california
law.
first
they
may
have
a
claim
that
they
could
sue
the
insurance
company
directly
because
of
their
exposure--
unknown
speaker
--and,
second,
they
may
have
a
claim
because
of
their
exposure
alone
under
california
law.
unknown
speaker
very
well,
mr.
tribe.
mr.
inselbuch,
we'll
hear
from
you.
unknown
speaker
i
can
understand,
mr.
inselbuch,
fibreboard
being
very
concerned
about
having
insurance
coverage.
but
i'd
first
like
you
to
help
me
over
my
first
part
where,
at
least
according
to
this
court's
decision,
there
are
many
states
that
say
people
who
are
merely
exposed,
having
suffered
any
physical,
any
affliction
yet,
simply
do
not
have
a
claim.
unknown
speaker
you
mean
if
i
say
i
may
some
day
be
ill
and
it
may
be
caused
by
x,
so
i
can
sue
x's
insurer
to
say
that
if
i
should
become
ill
i
would
be
covered?
unknown
speaker
mr.
inselbuch,
maybe...
and
i
don't
know
of
any
case
of
that
allows
somebody
who
is
not
yet
but
may
be
and
maybe
not
be
to
do
what
you
say.
but
even--
--i
think
that
the
way
we
normally
handle
the
problem...
it
is
a
problem...
is
simply
to
say
you
cannot
affect
the
rights
of
such
a
person.
you're
absolutely
right,
it
would
be
terribly
unfair.
but
the
normal
way
we've
handled
it
is
not
to
allow
a
person
to
come
in
when
he
hasn't
been
injured
at
all,
you
don't
know
he's
ever
going
to
be
a
claimant
at
all.
we've
simply
said
such
a
person's
rights
cannot
now
be
affected.
unknown
speaker
mr.
inselbuch,
when
you
say
that's
why
we
have
it,
it's
true
that
there
are
many
people
who
today
will
take
words
and
say,
oh,
this
fits
the
words.
but
if
we
go
back
to
when
rule
23
was
on
the
books
and
we
go
back
to
the
'66
amendments,
which
is
when
all
this
came
in,
nobody
had
even
the
wildest
dream
that
you
could
bring
a
mass
tort
action
even
under
(b)(3),
no
less
(b)(1).
and
then
kaplan
was
very
clear
to
calm
the
people
who
were
worried.
he
said,
no,
you
can't
use
this
statute
that
way.
this
thing
is,
he
said,
"redolent
of
a
preexisting
fund".
so
it
wasn't
what
(b)(1)(b)
was
meant
to
be.
i
think
the
best
you
can
say
is,
well,
maybe
it
wasn't
meant
to
be
that,
but
the
words
fit
it.
unknown
speaker
i
thought
the
insurance
litigation
was
in
california
and
this
is...
these
are
personal
injury
claims
against
fibreboard
in
texas.
unknown
speaker
are
these
class
members
suing
the
insurance
company?
unknown
speaker
i
thought
there
were
no
coverage
issues
in
texas;
the
coverage
issues
were
in
california.
what
was
presented
to
the
court
in
texas
was,
this
is
what
we're
willing
to
do.
but
there
was
no
litigation
over
coverage
in
texas,
was
there?
unknown
speaker
if
this
case
had
been
brought
as
a
(b)(3)
action,
then
it
would
have
been
out
the
window
under
amchem.
unknown
speaker
so
a
defendant
could
always
in
this
situation,
facing
massive
tort
liability,
it's
really
a
defendant's
option
to
say:
i
want
to
get
this
cleaned
up
under
(b)(1)(b),
i
don't
want
to
give
anybody
an
opportunity
to
opt
out.
is
there
any
mass
toxic
tort
that
could
not
be
handled
this
way
at
the
option
of
defendant
and
defendant's
insurers?
unknown
speaker
but
you
must
reconstruct
it
for
me,
because
i
thought
that
the
driving
force
for
this
litigation
was
fibreboard
and
its
insurers,
and
not
some
preexisting...
there
were
the
plaintiffs
who
had
what
they
called
the
inventory
claims,
but
didn't
this
all
get
started,
this
idea
of
a
global
settlement...
wasn't
the
global
settlement
the
idea
of
the
insurers
and
fibreboard,
and
then
we
had
the
plaintiffs?
unknown
speaker
and
of
the
live
plaintiffs
at
that
time,
all
of
their
claims
were
settled
outside
this.
unknown
speaker
suppose
i'm
an
asbestos
person
who
didn't
file
suit
before
the
cutoff
and
i
say:
well,
i
have
a
claim
for
tort
damages
against
fibreboard.
i
thought
that
the
common
law,
the
state
tort
law,
gave
me
this
claim.
why
don't
i
have
it?
unknown
speaker
i
don't
think
that's
answering
my
question.
i'm
talking
about--
unknown
speaker
--i
have
a
plain...
all
these
claims
are
in
their
essential
nature
personal
injury
damage
claims.
they
get...
they
become
something
else
in
the
course
of
this
global
settlement.
so
i
am
trying
to
understand
how
what
is
an
ordinary
garden
variety
tort
claim
in
an
individual's
hand
becomes
this
fair,
equitable...
and
i'll
accept
that
all
this
was
a
wonderful
settlement.
how
does
that
happen
under
the
heading
of
a
federal
rule,
not
even
an
act
of
congress?
that's
what
i--
unknown
speaker
--but
this
is
including
people
who
are
as
yet
unborn
and
people
who
have
not
yet
been
injured,
as
others
have
pointed
out,
and
who
may
well
not
have
been
represented
or
represented
adequately
within
the
meaning
of
the
rule.
and
it
also
appears
that
the
whole
effort
to
create
the
class,
the
mandatory
class,
was
an
effort
made
by
fibreboard
and
the
insurance
companies
rather
than
by
the
class
itself.
it
was
fibreboard
that
went
out
and
got
some
lawyers
together
to
bring
them
in
and
say:
gee,
let's
solve
this
problem.
and
maybe
it's
ultimately
a
good
solution,
but
it's
hard
to
shoehorn
it
in
under
rule
23,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
was
that
a
class
for
monetary
relief?
sure
there's
all
kinds
of
injunction
relief
where
the
court
says,
defendant,
you
do
this,
and
the
defendant
has
to
act
the
same
way
to
everybody
in
the
class,
like
the
warden
has
to
act
the
same
way.
those
injunctive
relief
claims
are
a
horse
of
an
entirely
different
color.
unknown
speaker
mullane
was
a
common
trust
fund.
it
was
a
kind
of
an
animal
that
all
these
small
investors
could
come
together.
of
necessity
there
had
to
be
periodic
accounting
so
the
trustee
could
get
a
clean
bill
of
health.
unknown
speaker
i
think
justice
jackson
made
it
perfectly
plain
that
there
was
in
that
case
kind
of
a
jurisdiction
by
necessity,
plus
that
most
of
these
people
were
going
to
get
at
least
mail
notice,
they
all
had
the
same
kind
of
small
little
claims,
and
there
would
be
a
few
that
were
left
out.
but
here
most
of
the
people
who
will
be
affected
don't
even
know
that
they're
going
to
be
affected
and
may
not
yet
be
persons
in
being.
unknown
speaker
yes,
and
there
had
to
be
periodic
accountings.
unknown
speaker
and
if
you
didn't
have
periodic
accountings,
you
couldn't
have
this.
unknown
speaker
mr.
inselbuch,
what
is
your
response
to
the
remainder
of
justice
o'connor's
question,
particularly
her
asking
you
about
the
fact
that
the
case
was
generated
from
the
defense
side
rather
than
the
plaintiff
side?
unknown
speaker
who
is
the
"we"
now,
the
insurers
for
fibreboard?
unknown
speaker
but
that
wasn't
the
only
issue
in
the
case.
i
mean,
you
describe
the
case
as
involving
only
that.
if
it
involved
only
that,
it'd
be,
yes,
a
classic
case
for
a
class
action.
but
that's
not
the
only
issue
that
all
of
these
claims
involve.
it
may
have
been
the
most
crucial
issue
financially
to
your
clients,
but
to
say
that
each
of
these
cases
centers
around
that
issue
it
seems
to
me
is
to
misdescribe
it.
unknown
speaker
sure
it
is.
but
each
plaintiff
is
going
to
have
to
make
a
separate
showing
about
exposure
and
about
the
amount
of
injury,
and
to
lump
them
all
together
in
one
class
just
because
they're
all
interested
in
getting
money
from
the
insurance
company
seems
to
me
to
go
beyond
what
the
rule
provides.
unknown
speaker
that's
not
how
the
rule
reads.
if
the
most
important
question
is
in
common.
unknown
speaker
is
there
authority...
if
we
think
of
a
classic
limited
fund,
not
this
case
but
say
a
trust
which
for
some
reason
says
it
has
allegedly
engaged
in
some
kind
of
securities
fraud
and
generated
hundreds
of
millions
of
dollars
of
claims
and
they
only
have
10
million
left
in
the
trust.
the
claims
differ
a
little
bit
among
different
plaintiffs.
or
a
ship
sinks
or
has
toxic
fumes
and
tens
of
thousands
of
different
plaintiffs,
or
thousands
from
different
states.
they
have
somewhat
similar,
somewhat
different
claims,
but
a
classic
limited
fund.
is
there
authority
that
you
can
proceed
under
this
rule
and
cut
off
claims
by
those
plaintiffs,
say,
all
your
claims,
even
though
you're
from
different
states
and
even
though
some
of
you
don't
know
yet
that
you'll
actually
suffer
injury,
still
in
the
classic
limited
fund
you
must
be--
unknown
speaker
--no,
no.
unknown
speaker
in
other
words,
you
can
compel
a
person
who's
from
california
to
come
to
new
york
and
assert
his
claim
in
this
single
proceeding
against
a
single
trust,
even
though
he
may
just
be
an
exposure
person
or
he
may
just
have
a
slightly
different
claim?
unknown
speaker
so
your
exact
response
to
the
claim,
since
this
isn't
quite
the
same
thing,
that
in
bringing
the
person
from
california
and
saying
you
have
to
assert
the
claim,
let's
say,
in
new
york
and
that
you
overcome
the
due
process
objection
and
the
fact
that
that
person
doesn't
want
to
bring
her
claim
yet,
you
overcome
it
by--
unknown
speaker
--mr.
inselbuch,
chaffee,
who
you
quote,
said:
"it
is
a
cardinal
principle
of
such
class
suits
that
the
omitted
members
must
be
interested
in
the
subject
matter
of
the
controversy
in
the
same
way
as
their
representatives.
"
"if
the
unjoined
persons
have
special
claims
or
liabilities,
their
rights
are
personal
and
cannot
be
concluded
in
their
absence.
"
so
i'm
still
left
with
the
question
of
how
a
personal
right
without
one's
consent,
no
matter
how
good
a
deal
it
may
be,
gets
taken
away.
unknown
speaker
as
far
as
the
insurance,
do
i
understand
the
fact
background
that
the
fibreboard
had
won
in
the
first
instance
in
california,
it
was
on
appeal
when
they
decided
that
they
would
settle
it,
fibreboard
and
the
insurance
company...
companies--
unknown
speaker
--no,
that's
not
what
i
meant
to
say.
i
meant
to
say,
wasn't
it
fibreboard
had
won
against
its
insurer
that
case
without
any
plaintiffs
in
it,
injured,
was
going
to
the
court
of
appeals.
it
got
stayed
when
fibreboard,
the
insurers,
and
i
don't
know
who--
unknown
speaker
--sat
down
at
the
dolly
madison,
right?
unknown
speaker
do
i
understand
that
with
the
other
insurers
who
were
in
the
same,
that
fibreboard...
that
most
of
the
rulings,
final
rulings,
were
in
favor
of
fibreboard
in
the
insurance
litigation?
unknown
speaker
so
if
everything
had
played
out
with
the
insurance
company,
then
fibreboard
would
have
had
its
coverage
against
the
insurers?
unknown
speaker
well,
in
order
to
do
that
in
the
eighteenth
century
cases
was
there
any
finding
necessary
that
in
effect
the
fund
that
was
created
was
the
best
possible
deal?
was
there
a
kind
of
fairness
hearing,
if
you
will?
unknown
speaker
no,
no.
in
the
eighteenth
century
cases
that
you're
relying
on.
in
other
words,
i
am
guessing
that
those
cases
did
not
proceed
on
the
premise
that
the
individuals
who
wanted
peace
could
simply
come
up
with
any
figure
and
say,
let's
settle,
as
it
were,
everything
on
this
figure
and
bind
everybody
else.
i
presume,
i'm
guessing,
and
i
want
to
know
if
my
guess
is
right,
that
there
was
some
kind
of
a
finding
that
the
fund
created,
the
settlement
amount,
if
you
will,
was
the
best
deal
for
the
global
class.
is
that
so?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
well,
you
still
wouldn't
know
how
much
money
the
company
is
going
to
have,
would
you?
unknown
speaker
unless
and
until
the
company
is
bankrupt
and
goes
out
of
business,
you
have
no
idea
how
much
money
the
company's
going
to
have
when
these
later
suits
are
brought.
that's
right.
unknown
speaker
and
certainly
the
company
would
not
be
discharged.
but
didn't
they
hire
an
expert
in
this
case
to
figure
out
how
much
money
was
available
from
the
company?
unknown
speaker
didn't
they
hire
an
expert
in
this
case
to
make
the
very
calculation
that
justice
scalia
says
could
not
have
been
made?
unknown
speaker
but
they
were
calculating
what
the
company
was
worth
today.
but
some
of
these
cases
were
going
to
come
up
years
from
now,
people
who
are
not
yet
even
born.
you
have
know
idea
how
much,
how
rich
the
company
was
going
to
be
at
that
point.
unknown
speaker
but
do
you
really
challenge
the
fact
that
they
would
have
gone
bankrupt
if
this
whole
thing
had
fallen
apart?
unknown
speaker
but
suppose
it
was
limited.
suppose
all
those
objections
are
gone.
suppose
we
knew
for
sure
it's
absolutely
limited.
are
you
still
saying
still
you
couldn't
settle,
still
you
couldn't
do
it,
because
there's
a
woman
in
massachusetts
or
california
or
someplace
whose
personal
claim
would
be
determined
by
this
settlement,
who
doesn't
want
to
join?
unknown
speaker
no,
no.
i'm
just
taking
you
back
where
you
just
were
a
second
ago
in
your
argument.
you
kept
saying
but
it's
unlimited,
you
know.
suppose
it
was
limited.
i'm
thinking
of
the--
unknown
speaker
--yes,
suppose--
unknown
speaker
--whatever
it
is,
total
no
more
than.
unknown
speaker
so
your
argument
basically
is
that
you
can't
bring
any
of
these
classes
period
if
there's
one
person
who
objects?
unknown
speaker
what
i'm
driving
at,
though,
is
taking
those
special
features
out
of
it,
is
your
argument
that
if
we
have
an
insurance
fund
that's
absolutely
limited,
no
trilateral
agreement,
but
we're
trying
to
set
up
a
process
to
bring
in
everyone
who
has
similar
claims,
if
there
is
even
one
person
from
a
different
state
who
objects
it's
no
good?
