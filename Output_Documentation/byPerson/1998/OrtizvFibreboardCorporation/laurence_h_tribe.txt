mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
fifth
circuit
does
not
deny
that
this
class
is
just
as
noncohesive
and
riven
with
conflict
as
the
one
in
amchem,
and
it
even
admits,
in
its
words,
that
a
class
action...
i'm
reading
from
footnote
8
of
the
opinion...
class
action
requesting
individual
damages
for
a
global
class
of
asbestos
claimants
would
not
satisfy
the
typicality
requirements.
now,
since
that
is
this
case,
the
first
mystery,
i
think,
to
be
addressed
is
how
the
fifth
circuit
and
the
respondents
imagine
that
they
can
get
past
rule
23(a)
here.
i
think
a
fair
version
of
their
answer
is
that
one
should
focus
on
how
the
settlements
would
operate
and
not
on
what
the
complaints
sought,
and
if
you
do
that,
you're
told
you
will
see
that
the
settlement
in
amchem
would
have
ended
up,
in
their
words,
awarding
damages
to
class
members
based
on
the
severity
of
their
injuries,
while
this
settlement,
according
to
them,
just
sets
up
an
equitable
distribution
process
that
leaves
intact
each
claimants,
and
i
now
quote
them
again,
absolute
right
to
exit
into
the
tort
system
to
litigate
his
claims
in
court.
now,
that
answer
is
fallacious
from
top
to
bottom.
amchem
held,
among
other
things,
that
one
cannot
rely
entirely
on
the
operation
of
the
settlement
to
dissolve
divisions
that
preclude
class
certification,
and
their
description,
both
of
the
settlement
in
amchem
and
of
the
settlement
in
this
case,
are
flatly
wrong.
the
amchem
settlement,
as
this
court
noted,
did
not
preordain
the
amounts
to
be
awarded
to
each
claimant,
just
as
this
settlement
doesn't,
and
this
settlement
certainly
does
not
simply
add
a
fund
from
which
damages
can
be
paid
to
plaintiffs.
it
does
not
preserve
the
absolute
right
to
exit,
as
i'll
explain
in
just
a
moment.
it
extinguishes
individual
rights
to
sue
and
substitutes
access
to
a
trust
distribution
process
rather
akin
to
worker's
compensation.
the
reason
i
say
that
it
does
not
preserve
a
right
to
exit
is
that
first
of
all
no
exit
is
possible
till
one
has
exhausted
mediation,
arbitration,
and
other
adr
mechanisms,
and
even
then
the
plaintiff
who
does
exit
remains
subject
to
all
of
the
settlement's
strict
limits,
[$]
1/2
million
as
a
cap
on
compensatory
damages,
no
punitive
damages,
no
prejudgment
interest,
no
post
judgment
interest,
no
joint
and
several
liability.
and
finally,
anyone
who
does
exit
is
penalized
for
exercising
the
right
recognized
i
guess
most
recently
in
wright
v.
universal
maritime
service
corporation,
right
of
going
to
court,
penalized
because
payments
can
then
be
deferred
for
up
to
10
years
without
interest
as
compared
with
3
years
if
someone
opts
not
to
exit
and
remains
within
the
trust
system.
now--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--yes,
justice
ginsburg,
they
certainly
did,
and
what
i
would
like
to
show
in
a
moment
is
that,
if
that's
the
difference,
it
cuts
very
much
against
class
certification
here.
it
cuts
against
class
certification
partly
because,
as
i'll
try
to
show,
it's
impossible
to
squeeze
this
into
that
category
of
a
mandatory
class,
but
in
any
event,
that
can't
solve
the
problems
under
(a),
the
problems
of
cohesion
and
of
the
absence
of
conflict.
and
in
particular,
if
you
focus
on
the
absence
of
conflict,
what's
crucial
to
note
is
that
the
equitable
distribution
process
in
this
case
embodies
allocational
decisions,
decisions
to
limit
damage
payments
from
the
trust.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
well,
mr.
chief
justice,
i'm
not
talking
about
how
good
or
bad
in
terms
of
ultimate
fairness
the
settlement
is,
only
the
question
of
whether
it
was
proper
to
certify
it
in
the
first
instance.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
well,
mr.
chief
justice,
if
we
were
talking
about
whether
it's
a
good
settlement,
if
that's
the
reason
i
was
mentioning
the
caps,
i
guess
we
would.
i'm
mentioning
them
only
to
make
clear
that
as
in
amchem
this
is
not
simply
a
favor
that
they
are
doing
to
the
people
who
have
been
victimized
by
asbestos.
it
is
a
substitution
of
their
old
rights
with
a
set
of
equitable
rights,
and
it's
a
substitution
that
makes
some
allocational
decisions
with
respect
to
which
there's
a
deep
division,
a
conflict.
those
who
are
presently
injured
have,
as
in
amchem,
an
interest
in
maximizing
payments
early.
those
who
are
merely
exposed
have
an
interest
in
preserving
money
for
the
future,
and
there
was
no
attempt
to
create
subclasses
here.
if
subclasses
with
separate
representation
had
been
created,
no
one
can
really
guess
exactly
how
the
ultimate
settlement
would
look.
there's
no
reason
to
suppose
that
it
couldn't
have
been
done,
and
no
reason,
therefore,
to
suppose
that
the
only
alternative
is
an
endless
stream
of
individual
lawsuits.
in
fact,
99
percent
of
asbestos
litigation
settles
in
any
event.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
they
are
objectors--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--they
are
individual
objectors
who
were
exposed
to
asbestos,
and
who
do
not
want
to
be
members
of
this
class,
and
who
were
allowed--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--yes.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
that's
correct.
they
were
exposed,
and
they
were
allowed
to
intervene
for
purposes
of
expressing
objection
both
to
the
nonopt-out
nature
of
the
class,
and
to
the
certification
as
a
unitary
class.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
i
think
there
are
five.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
well,
three
of
them
do.
the
ones
that
are
not
from
texas
also
under
shutts
question
personal
jurisdiction.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
i
believe
alabama...
i
guess
they're
all
from
alabama.
i
thought
one
had
been
from
missouri.
the
others
are
from
alabama.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
well...
no.
i
think
ultimately,
because
of
the
justiciability
problems
and
the
notice
problems,
it
would
have
to
be
cut
down
to
a
manageable
size.
those
who
are
merely
exposed,
some
of
whom
don't
even
exist
yet,
who
haven't
been
born,
who
are
future
spouses
of
people
exposed,
we
think
couldn't
possibly
be
included
in
a
class,
but
at
least
it's
not
inconceivable
that
a
somewhat
more
modest
effort
could
work,
as
long
as
there
were
subclasses
so
that
subgroups
with
distinct
interests
were
separately
represented.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
that's
right.
justice
ginsburg,
we
think
that
if
this
could
have
been
certified
at
all,
it
would
have
been
under
(b)(3)
with
subclasses
and
with
a
more
modest
scope.
maybe
i
should
turn
to
why
i
think
(b)(1)(b)
is
of
really
no
help.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
that's
separate,
justice
breyer.
there
are
two
huge
conflicts.
one
is,
as
you
say,
that
they
represented
their
own
45,000,
but
they
opted
out
en
masse
from
this
nonopt-out
class.
the
other
is
that
within
the
class
itself,
the
gerrymandered
class,
within
that
class
they
should
not
simultaneously
have
represented
the
presently
injured
and
the
merely
exposed,
and
also
the
pre
and
post--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--well--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--justice
breyer--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--i
don't...
i
don't
think--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--as
a
matter
of
law,
i
think
he
was
wrong.
it's
not
that
we're
asking
you
to
review
some
factual
determination
about
how
capable
and
ethical
these
lawyers
are,
but
with
respect
to
the
idea
that
because
there
was
so
little
time
between
august
9,
1993
and
august
27,
18
days,
that
it
therefore
follows
that,
since
subclassing
might,
in
his
view,
throw
a
monkey
wrench
into
a
well-oiled
machine,
that
therefore
he
had
no
choice,
that's
wrong
as
a
matter
of
law.
for
one
thing,
the
relevant
time
is
not
august
1993.
it's
1990,
when
fiberboard
approached
counsel
to
arrive
at
a
global
settlement.
that's
when
these
various
conflicts
were--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--well--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--i
do.
i--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--if
one
takes
amchem
as
binding
precedent,
then
the
fact
that
one
might
have
regarded
the
whole
thing
as
a
much
more
nuanced
balance
is
no
longer
on
the
table.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
principle
of
amchem
is
that
unconflicted
representation
as
a
matter
of
law
can
be
judged
de
novo
by
this
court.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
both,
primarily--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--we
know
that--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--well,
it...
the
focus
on
adequacy
of
representation
has
been
interpreted
by
this
court
to
mean
that
not
only
must
the
class
representatives
meaningfully
speak
for
the
groups
in
question,
but
that
the
attorneys
must
have
the
ability
meaningfully
to
represent
them,
since,
as
this
court
knows,
it's
the
attorneys
that
are
making
this
deal.
here,
the
class
representatives
were
added
as
an
afterthought,
after
the
deal
was
structured.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
(b)(1)(b).
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
i'd
love
to.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
it
seems
to
me
that
the
reason
you
can't
certify
under
(b)(1)(b)
is
primarily
that
there
is
nothing
in
this
case
that
remotely
resembles
a
limited
fund.
that
is,
a
preexisting,
finite
asset
or
res
that
would
be
more
than
exhausted
by
competing
claims.
the
limit
here
of--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--well,
here--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--several
points,
justice
o'connor.
first
of
all,
in
this
case
2/10ths
of
1
percent
of
the
corporate
assets
were
put
in,
not
quite
the
whole
thing.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
well,
if
it's
in
bankruptcy,
and
then
you
have
a
res--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--right.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
well,
no
court--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--well,
if
there
were
not,
as
there
is
in
this
case,
a
potentially
unlimited
insurance
fund,
which
i
do
want
to
turn
to,
and
if,
therefore,
when
we're
in
that
category
of
cases
where
you
can
predict
insolvency
from
a
stream
of
liability
judgments
arising
from
a
mass
tort,
then,
if
you
look
at
the
position
that
the
author
of
the
rule,
benjamin
kaplan,
took,
and
we
quote
him
in
the
brief,
and
the
advisory
committee,
it
appears...
and
no
court
has
yet
disagreed
with
this...
that
that
is
not
the
office
of
this
rule.
that
is,
it
is
not
the
purpose
of
this
rule
to
provide
a
kind
of
jump
start
on
bankruptcy
without
all
of
the
protections
of
bankruptcy
for
treating
creditors
equally.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
well,
the
language
in
fact
is
broader
than
anything
about
a
limited
fund.
it
talks
about
the
question
of
whether
separate
adjudic...
separate
lawsuits
would
create
a
risk.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
but
you
can't
squeeze
that
within
this
language,
because
in
this
case
what
creates
the
risk
is
the
chance
of
a
lawsuit
involving
insurers
in
california
coming
out
the
wrong
way,
not
separate
suits
by
individuals.
given
parklane
hosiery,
those
suits
are
not
a
threat.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
well,
i'm
dubious.
it
seems
to
me
that
unless...
unless
you
have
something
which
is
already
essentially
reduced
to
equitable
rights
in
an
in
rem
situation,
using
(b)(1)(b)
is
already
dubious,
but
the
most
important
point
i
want
to
make
about
(b)(1)(b)--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--yes.
but
the
most
important
point
of
(b)(1)(b)
is
the
question
of
causality
and
the
direction
of
timed
error,
basically.
keep
in
mind
how,
in
this
case,
when
you
put
in
some
part
of
the
assets
of
the
corporation
and
put
in
also
the
money
from
the
insurance
companies,
you
get
to
this
limit
of
[$]
1.53
billion.
that
limit
did
not
come
from
some
pre-existing
exogenous
variable.
the
testimony
in
this
case,
when
mr.
inselbuch,
for
example,
specifically
asked
counsel
for
the
insurance
company,
continental,
whether
there
was
any
limit,
the
counsel
responded,
no,
it
is
not...
it
is
not
a
capped
amount
of
money.
that's
at
page
281a
of
the
joint
appendix...
and
the
ethics
expert
on
their
side,
professor
hazard,
said
that
for
practical
purposes
this
amount
is
without
limit.
the
limit
is
the
amount
they
were
willing
to
pay
in
order
to
move
class
counsel
from
a
(b)(3)
class,
which
was
their
initial
preference,
with
opt-outs,
to
a
(b)(1)(b)
class,
and
it
would
be
the
height
of
inversion
and
irony
to
say
that
an
amount
of
money
that
grew
in
order
for
it
to
squeeze
into
(b)(1)(b)
is
now
somehow
limited.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
that
is,
the
limit
has
to
come--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--prior
to
bankruptcy
or
receivership
i
can
think
of
no
such
case,
because
the
rule
that
bothers
them,
first
come,
first
served,
is
part
and
parcel
of
the
legal
right
that
these
individuals
claim
when
they
want
to
sue.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
i'm
sorry,
justice
kennedy,
i
don't
see
how--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--well,
i
can
imagine
a
different
kind
of
suit,
the
one
that
they
would
like
to
think
this
is,
against
the
insurance
companies
in
which
one
seeks--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--but
the
insurance
company
isn't
the
defendant.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
and
they're
perhaps
interpleaded?
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
it
still
seems
to
me
that
making
a
(b)(1)(b)
class
out
of
is
problematic.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
that's
right,
and
because
of
the
rules
enabling
act,
which
in
effect
says
that
you
can't
take
one
of
these
rules
like
(b)(1)(b)
and
use
it
to
create
a
limit
that
was
not
independently
there.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
no,
that's
right.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
that's
right.
that
is,
in
this
case
one
needn't
go
that
far,
but
i
thought
that
justice
ginsburg
wanted
to
press
the
theory,
and--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--well,
under
the
1994
amendments
to
the
bankruptcy
law
which
codified
a
preexisting
practice,
a
trust
would
be
set
up,
and
its
details
would
be
negotiated,
and
that
trust
would
be
used
to
distribute
over
time
the
remaining
proceeds,
whatever
they
were,
among
all
creditor
classes,
including
the
asbestos
plaintiffs
for
whom
the
amendments
were
particularly
designed,
and--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--very
much
like
that,
and
in
particular
the
national
commission
which
looked
at
all
of
this
concluded
that
the
protection
in
that
context
for
plaintiffs
who
have
been
exposed
but
not
yet
injured
is
greater
than
what
they
imagined
would
exist
in
class
actions.
here,
notice
what
happens
when
you
allow
the
circumvention
of
the
federal
bankruptcy
procedure.
by
telling
fibreboard
that
if
it
prefers
not
to
put
its
assets
on
the
line
and
go
into
bankruptcy,
and
can
just
put
really
pennies
on
the
line,
[$]
1/2
million
to
get
rid
of
billions
of
dollars
of
liability,
it's
not
only
that
fibreboard
is
getting
away
with
a
great
deal.
it's
also
that
all
of
the
other
creditors,
real
prop...
people
who
were
injured
in
real
property
terms
with
respect
to
asbestos,
and
trade
creditors,
none
of
them
are
crammed
down
in
the
way
that
this
one
group
of
victims
is,
and
to
allow
that
where
the
bankruptcy
laws
would
be
far
more
equitable
as
a
kind
of
home-made
version
of
bankruptcy--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--well,
for
one
thing
it's
not
clear
to
me
that
you
have
to
force
them
into
bankruptcy.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
but
it's
not
a
fund.
the
fund
was
created.
it's
not
as
though
you
had
a
fund,
and
people
are
now
fighting
over
it.
it
would
not
comply
with
the
literal
words
of
the
rule.
it
turns
it
upside
down
to
say
that
in
the
settlement
you
can
create
a
fund.
it
could
have
been
[$]
3
billion
or
[$]
4
billion,
but
because
the
bargaining
posture
caps
it
at
[$]
1.5
billion,
that
is
all
that
people
can
fight
over.
in
a
situation
of
this
sort,
if
i'm
right
that
(b)(1)(b)
is
unavailable,
(b)(3),
with
opt-outs,
is
an
option
if
you
have
subclasses.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
i
think
the
fundamental
principle
that
it
violates
is
that
the
parties
who
are
at
the
bargaining
table
ought
not
to
be
able,
by
mutual
contrivance,
to
create
a
situation
in
which
others
who
are
not
represented,
some
of
whom
are
sick
and
others
who
will
get
sick,
are
simply
told,
fait
accompli,
because
they
weren't
willing
to
put
more
money
on
the
table
you'll
have
to
take
a
pro
rata
share
as
though
you
were
a
kind
of
equity
stakeholder
when
the
state
law
under
which
you
claim
gives
you
a
legal
right.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
right.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
no.
i
think
it's
a
function
of
the
state
law,
and
i
agree
with
you,
under
the
way
the
states
define
these
rights--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--right.
i
think--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--i
think,
though,
without
having
some
metatheory
of
fairness,
one
looks
at
the
state
law.
the
state
law
defines
that
as
part
and
parcel
of
the
right.
one
can't
use
these
rules
to
simply
transmogrify
by
some
alchemy
the
content
of
these
rights,
and
so
i
very
much--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--and
maybe
not
even
an
article
iii
case
or
controversy
yet.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
we
do
maintain
that,
but
the
court
needn't
reach
that.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
no--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--justice
breyer,
under
california
law,
and
we
point
this
out
in
our
a
footnote
in
our
reply
brief,
they
do
not
have
the
ability
to
bring
the
kind
of
imaginary
suit
that
they're
now
talking
about,
because
it
is
only
those
who
are
already
injured
under
california
law
who
can
sue
to
establish
status
as
third
party
beneficiaries
of
an
insurance
contract.
so
what
they're
really
asking,
they're
really,
i
think...
when
push
comes
to
shove
they're
saying,
well,
this
doesn't
really,
if
you
look
at
the
formalities,
look
like
a
lawsuit
that
could
fit
(b)(1)(b)
or
that
can
comply
with
23(a),
but
let's
rewrite
it.
let's
do
what
this
court
didn't
let
the
sierra
club
do
when
it
came
to
hiking
and
biking.
rewrite
the
complaint.
imagine
that
we
sued
not
fibreboard,
but
the
insurance
companies.
imagine
that
we
claimed,
not
asbestos
torts,
but
insurance
coverage.
imagine
that
this
were
a
different
kind
of
case.
imagine
that
we
have
the
right
set
of
plaintiffs,
including
the
45,000
who
would
logically
be
included
if
that
were
the
lawsuit.
if
you
can
imagine
all
of
that,
including
the
inclusion
of
these
nonripe
claims
that
don't
satisfy
california
law
or
article
iii,
then
maybe
we
can
prevail.
but
it
seems
to
me
that
that
is
not
even
remotely
this
case,
and
that
to
try
to
sort
of
transform
this
class
action
into
a
suit
about
insurance
coverage,
because
that's
the
big
disaster
that
they
face,
that
the
insurance
coverage
is
gone.
everyone
recognizes
there's
a
problem.
in
effect,
they
accuse
us
of
worrying
about
arranging
the
deck
chairs
on
the
titanic.
they
say
that
the
ship
is
going
to
hit
an
iceberg,
and
you
guys
are
playing
around
worrying
about
what
they
call
trivial
sideshows,
special
interests,
like
i
guess
the
people
who
are
very,
very
sick.
well,
the
fact
is,
it's
when
you're
about
to
hit
an
iceberg
that
you
should
worry
about
who
gets
access
to
the
lifeboats,
and
the
fact
that
you've
got
to
have
various
safeguards
to
try
to
prevent
a
collision
doesn't
mean
that
you
can
forget
safeguards
for
the
separate
subclasses
of
passengers
that
are
affected.
i'd
like
to
save
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
when
mr.
inselbuch
says
that
they
do
not
argue
that
this
is
a
limited
fund,
i
understand
that's
now
their
position.
but
just
to
get
the
history
straight,
throughout
the
history
of
this
case
and
in
the
fifth
circuit
that
was
apparently
the
theory
on
which
(b)(1)(b)
was
applicable.
i
do
want
to
say
a
word
about
bills
of
peace
because
i
think
that
has
caused
some
confusion
here.
they
did
not
bind
absent
class
members.
we
discussed
that
in
footnote
20
of
our
reply
brief.
they
were
really
like
permissive
joinders
and
they
don't
provide
any
precedent
for
what's
happening
here.
i
think
if
you
ask
what
is
happening
here,
it's
most
dramatically
put
in
a
question
that
i
think
both
in
one
way
or
another
justice
ginsburg
and
justice
o'connor
were
asking,
and
that
is
just
take
the
ordinary
garden
variety
tort
claim
by
somebody
who
in
fact
has
been
injured,
not
just
exposed
but
is
experiencing
injury,
who
didn't
happen
to
file
by
the
magic
turn
into
a
pumpkin
date
of
august
27,
1993.
by
what
alchemy
is
it,
by
what
edict
of
congress,
or
by
what
inherent
judicial
authority
without
congress,
is
it
that
that
ordinary
claim
gets
transmuted
into
not
a
first
come,
first
served
right
to
be
paid,
but
some
intangible
chunk
of
a
fund
whose
limits
are
established
from
the
defense
side.
i
mean,
i
don't
think
there
has
really
been
an
answer
to
that
question.
this
is
not,
after
all,
a
case
where,
for
example,
the
insurance
policies
have
relevant
ceilings
on
coverage.
here
the
aggregate
is
unlimited,
which
is
why
there
was
no
limit
to
the
fund.
but
if
there
were
a
ceiling
on
coverage
of
the
relevant
policy,
i
can
imagine
that
creating
a
preexisting
limited
fund,
so
that
under
(b)(1)(b)
you
might
have
direct
claims
against
the
insurance
company,
but
it
wouldn't
discharge
the
defendant.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
no.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
it
may
discover
a
gold
mine
or
something.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
i'm
sorry?
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
but
they
may
not
have
been
right.
they
were
bought
for
over
half
a
billion
dollars
by
ocs.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
the
crystal
ball
is
clouded.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
if
there
had
been
no
insurance
money
available,
i
think
that
it
would
be
unrealistic
of
me
to
say
they
wouldn't
have
gone
into
chapter
11.
i
think
they
would
have
gone.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
well,
still
you
couldn't
do
a
mandatory
class
that
resolves
it
against
the
company,
as
opposed
to
a
specific--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--suppose
the
insurance
had
an
aggregate
limit--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--of
[$]
10
million.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
you
still
would
have
to...
you
could
not
in
my
view--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--well,
but
that
overstates
it.
you
can't
bring
a
(b)(1)(b)
class
when
normal
legal
rights
are
at
stake.
and
i
don't
think
that
the
respondents
are
really
disagreeing.
if
you
listen
to
what
mr.
inselbuch
says,
he
says
that
this
case
is
unique,
which
i
doubt
because
there
are
others
around
the
country
waiting
in
the
wings,
i
know
about
a
number
of
them,
to
see
if
this
limited
fund
theory
will
fly.
what
makes
it,
he
says,
unique
is
that
it
had
to
be
done.
there
was
a
death
struggle
over
insurance.
it
had
to
be
done
this
way
in
order
to
resolve
insurance
coverage.
that
is
demonstrably
false.
what
he
has
simply
forgotten
about,
i
guess,
is
the
trilateral
agreement
which
was
negotiated
between
the
two
insurers
and
fibreboard,
putting
[$]
3.35
billion
on
the
table,
and
it's
there
right
now
without
taking
any
rights
away
from
any
of
the
plaintiffs.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
well,
you
have
to
go
from
the
dolly
madison
to
congress
to
get
a
solution
to
that
one,
it
seems
to
me.
