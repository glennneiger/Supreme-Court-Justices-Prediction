unknown
speaker
that's
1441(b)?
unknown
speaker
and
in
what
part
of...
it's
a
short
section,
but
i
didn't
immediately
follow
where
you
were
getting
the
language
from.
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
that's
a
definition
of
defendant?
unknown
speaker
i
don't
see
why
it's
being
used
in
a
narrow
sense.
it
would
have
been
used
in
a
narrow
sense
if
1441(b)
had
just
said,
persons
who
are
defendants,
and
the
very
word
defendants
would
embrace
the
terms,
have
been
properly
joined
and
served.
unknown
speaker
it
didn't...
congress
didn't
think
that
the
word
defendant
automatically
embraced
those
terms,
and
therefore
it
said,
who...
people
who
have
been
joined
and
served
as
defendants.
i'm
not
sure
that
it
helps
your
case
more
than
hurts
it.
unknown
speaker
but
your
argument
has
to
be
based
on
the
proposition
that
congress
was
using
the
term,
defendant,
in
1441(b)
in
the
same
way
it
was
using
it
in
1446(b).
unknown
speaker
but
then
why
didn't...
if
you're
right,
why
didn't
the
congress
use
all
the
qualifying
language
from
1441(b)
in
1446(b)?
unknown
speaker
even
if
i...
i'm
not
sure
i
agree
with
you,
i
think
for
the
same
reason
that
justice
scalia's
question
suggested,
but
assuming
that
i
do
agree
with
you
for
the
sake
of
argument,
i
still
have
a
serious
problem
with
your
position,
and
it's
because
of
the
usage
of
defendant
in
1448.
1448
clearly
contemplates
that
some
individuals
who
are
defendants
in
a
case
that
has
been
removed
may
not
yet
have
been
served,
and
therefore,
in
1448,
it
seems
clearly
to
be
using
defendant
in
the
sense
of
somebody
who
is
simply
called
that
in
the
pleadings,
whether
or
not
served,
and
that's
the
sticking
point
that
i
have.
how
do
you
explain
how
i
could
accept
your
position
for
1446,
given
the
language
of
1448?
unknown
speaker
or
had
not
been
served
at
all.
unknown
speaker
or
had
not
been
served
at
all.
unknown
speaker
well,
assuming
that
is
the
case,
doesn't
it
also
demonstrate
that
in
1446
congress
could
not
have
been
using
defendant
in
the
narrow
sense,
i.e.,
that
which...
sense
that
requires
service,
as
part
of
the
meaning
of
the
term?
unknown
speaker
but
it
does
use
the
word,
the
bare
word
defendant,
and
there's
every
indication
in
our
pullman
case
that
we
understand
1448
to
apply
to
someone
who
is
named
as
a
defendant
but
not
yet
served,
as
it
states
on
its
face.
unknown
speaker
how
do
you
relate
federal
rule
of
civil
procedure
81(c)?
that
rule
deals
with
removed
actions,
and
when
a
defendant
has
to
file
his
answer.
unknown
speaker
it
uses
the
same
language.
unknown
speaker
receipt
through
service
or
otherwise
of
a
copy,
and
says
that
in
a
removed
action
in
which
the
defendant
has
not
answered,
the
defendant
has
20
days
to
file
a
response,
basically.
unknown
speaker
if
you're
right,
ms.
smith,
that
there
is
an
ambiguity,
then
how
do
you
interpret
the
meaning
of
the
word,
or
otherwise,
after
the
word,
through
service,
in
1446(b)?
unknown
speaker
the
situation
that
obtained
in
new
york
at
that
time?
unknown
speaker
i'm--
--i
had--
--let
me
ask
just
one...
the
second
clause
in
1446(b)
seems
to
deal
with
that
situation,
that
says
it
should
then
run
from
the
date
of
service.
unknown
speaker
and
if
that's
true,
there's
nothing
left
for
the
other
one.
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
or
otherwise
took
care
of
the
new
york-type
states.
unknown
speaker
but
you
needed
the
further
one
to
deal
with
this
kentucky
state--
unknown
speaker
--now,
how
does
new
york
and
kentucky...
what's
the
difference
between
those
two?
unknown
speaker
that's
like--
unknown
speaker
--but
wouldn't
the
second
clause
cover
there
rather
than
the
first,
even
in
new
york,
because
if
the...
oh,
you're
saying
the
complaint
need
not
be
served
for
a
long
period
of
time
but
must
ultimately
be
served,
but
it
would
have
been
filed
at
the
time
the
suit
was
filed,
wouldn't
it?
unknown
speaker
you
mean
you
can
file
suit
without
ever
filing
a
complaint?
unknown
speaker
it
wasn't
even
filed
in
the
clerk's
office?
unknown
speaker
in
trying
to
give
some
meaning
to
or
otherwise,
which
i
find
difficult
to
do,
does
it
help
to
construe
it
as
covering
cases
by
publication?
you
can
either
be
served--
unknown
speaker
--well,
but
i
was
wondering
if
the
or
otherwise
covers
that
situation.
i'm
trying
to
give
some
narrow
meaning
to
or
otherwise,
other
than
just
any
other
means
other
than
service,
and
i'm
having
difficulty
doing
that.
i
was
wondering
if--
unknown
speaker
--if
you
can
find
it
if
you
said
that
it
was
to
take
care
of
publication.
unknown
speaker
there's
not
much
disagreement,
is
there,
that
the
or
otherwise
was
inserted
particularly
to
take
care
of
the
new
york
situation,
where
you
start
an
action
by
filing...
by
serving
the
summons
and
unlike
the
federal
pattern,
where
they're
served
together,
so
they
put
receipt
of
the
complaint
or
otherwise,
not
by
process,
but
that
you
actually
receive
the
complaint,
and
i
think
it's
agreed
that
you
have
to
actually
receive
the
complaint
to
trigger,
under
anybody's
interpretation.
unknown
speaker
so--
--well,
that's
because
of
the
word
receipt.
right.
unknown
speaker
i
mean--
--can
i
ask
a
technical,
minor
thing,
following
up
justice
stevens?
is
this
right?
my
understanding
was
in
the
last
clause
they're
talking
about
a
case
where
the
initial
pleading,
i.e.
the
complaint,
has
been
filed
in
court
and
is
not
required
to
be
served
on
the
defendant.
unknown
speaker
that's
kentucky.
unknown
speaker
and
in
new
york,
those
words
do
not
apply,
because
in
new
york
a
complaint
is
required
to
be
served
on
the
defendant,
but
at
a
later
time.
unknown
speaker
is
that
right?
unknown
speaker
all
right.
well,
you're...
let
me
be
sure
i
have
your
position
correct.
a
case
is
filed,
and
the...
but
the
party...
i
see,
but
the
party
is
not
served,
and
you're
mailing
a
copy
of
the
complaint
that's
actually
been
filed.
you
don't
consider
that
otherwise,
because
there's
no
service
yet.
unknown
speaker
but
if
there
were
service...
i
mean,
i
suppose
the
hypothetical
case
that
this
applies
to
is
one
where
the
service
of
the
summons
comes
at
a
different
time
from
service
of
the
complaint,
but
i
don't
think
there
are
any...
they
don't
do
that
any
place,
do
they?
if
they
require
service
of
the
complaint,
it
always
accompanies
the
summons,
doesn't
it?
unknown
speaker
because
it
didn't
require
any
service.
unknown
speaker
so--
unknown
speaker
--so
the
otherwise
covers
the
new
york
practice
of
mailing
the
complaint
or--
unknown
speaker
--having
a
private
processor
delivering
it.
unknown
speaker
well
then,
how...
if
we
think
that's
the
congressional
intent,
how
do
we
then
define
otherwise?
what's
the
general
definition
of
otherwise
that
is
narrow
enough
to
address
just
this
circumstance?
unknown
speaker
what
you're
saying
is,
there
must
be
a
preliminary.
you
must
have--
--it
must--
--your
bottom
line
is,
whatever
else,
you
must
have
service
of
a
summons,
so
if
you
have
the
complaint
served
together
with
the
summons,
that's
fine,
that's
the
federal
pattern.
or
if
you
receive
the
complaint
apart
from
service
of
the
summons,
but
after
service
of
the
summons,
so
i
think
your
ground
position
is,
you
must
have
service.
the
complaint
can
be
served
simultaneously,
or
it
can
be
served
later,
but
at
a
minimum,
you
must
have
service.
unknown
speaker
it's
very
difficult
to
reconcile
with
the
language
of
the
statute,
which
doesn't
say...
it
says
receipt
by
service
or
otherwise,
so
to
say
that
you
must
have
service
to
get
the
thing
rolling,
it
seems
quite
contrary
to
the
language
of
the
statute.
unknown
speaker
let
me
ask
you
a
practical
consequence
of
the
eleventh
circuit's
formulation,
which
is
different
than
what
you
urge.
if
the
defendant
has
not
been
served
with
a
summons,
but
has
received
a
copy
of
the
complaint,
and
if
we
interpret
the
statute
as
requiring
removal
to
be
made
within
the
requisite
time
from
receipt
of
the
complaint,
does
the
defendant
waive
the
right
to
assert
lack
of
personal
jurisdiction
for
failure
to
be
served?
i
guess
no
one
disputes
that.
unknown
speaker
but
at
least
you
acknowledge
that
even
if
he
is
required
to
remove
he
can
say,
but
i've
never
been
served
and
i...
he
can
reserve
that,
of
course.
unknown
speaker
may
i
just
make
this
additional
observation?
it
wouldn't
necessarily
have
to
be
service.
i
suppose
the
defendant
could
enter
an
appearance,
and...
without
being
served,
and
then
the
time
would
start
to
run
if
he
got
a
copy
of
the
complaint.
say
they
mailed
him
a
copy
of
the
complaint
and
said,
this
was
filed,
we've
sent
the
marshal
off,
we
can't
find
you,
the
defendant
could
enter
an
appearance
when...
and
then
the
copy
would
be
enough.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
well,
maybe
they
should
have
written
it
that
way.
i
mean,
to...
you're
saying,
to
achieve
what
they
wanted
to
achieve,
they
should
have
written
it
differently.
but
if,
in
fact,
they
didn't
write
it
differently
and
went
further
than
they
should
have
gone,
i
don't
know
that
we
have
the
authority
to
cut
it
back.
you're
giving
this
a
very
artificial
definition
of
defendant.
defendant
means...
i
mean,
there
are
a
lot
of
conditions
for
being
a
proper
defendant.
surely
service
isn't
one
of
them.
i
mean,
service
isn't
the
only
one.
i
mean,
you
could
be
an
improper
defendant,
improperly
joined,
right?
unknown
speaker
a
misjoined
defendant.
unknown
speaker
but
you
would
still
be
a
defendant.
unknown
speaker
for
your
purposes.
well,
why
pick
out
the
one
qualification
that
you
have
to
have
been
served?
unknown
speaker
well,
what
if
a
defendant,
several
defendants
have
been
named,
diversity
of
citizenship
alleged,
and
one
defendant
is,
in
fact,
served,
the
others
are
not,
and
that
defendant
comes
in
and
says,
i
want
this
dismissed
because
by
the
allegations
of
the
complaint
itself
it
shows
there's
no
diversity
here.
now,
aren't
those
other
defendants
defendants
in
any
normal
sense
of
the
word?
unknown
speaker
so--
unknown
speaker
--yes.
unknown
speaker
well,
is
that
100
percent
true?
what
if
a
motion
to
dismiss
on
jurisdictional
grounds
was
made
before
the
wrong
defendants
had
been
served?
couldn't
the
plaintiff
at
that
time
say
i've
decided
to
dismiss
those,
never
serve
them,
just
say
that
i'll
just
abandon
my
claim
against
those?
unknown
speaker
well,
isn't...
a
plaintiff
can
always
drop
a
party
when
all
there
has
been
is
a
complaint.
the
com--
unknown
speaker
--you're
not
forced
to
sue
anyone.
unknown
speaker
and
that's
the
easy
answer.
unknown
speaker
but
your
point
is
the
defendant
who
isn't
served
doesn't
have
to
do
anything.
unknown
speaker
doesn't
have
to
answer
the
complaint,
doesn't
have
to
make
a
motion,
can
just
sit
back
and
until
he's
served
with
process
he
doesn't
have
to
act
affirmatively.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
mean,
that's
nice
until
they
passed
this
statute.
what
this
statute
says
is,
and
once
you
have
a
copy
of
the
complaint
if
you
want
to
remove
to
federal
court,
remove
to
federal
court.
i
mean,
the
world
won't
stop
if
you
set
up
that
thing,
it's
true,
that
prior
to
this
statute
we
had
this
different
system,
but
what
the
statute
says
is
that
once
you
get
the
complaint,
through
service
or
otherwise,
you
have
30
days.
unknown
speaker
well,
it's
a
question,
is
that
what
they
said
in
1949.
unknown
speaker
ms.
smith,
may
i
ask
you
another
question?
do
you
think
the
word
defendant
is
a
term
that
is
governed
by
federal
law
or
state
law?
supposing
the
state
had
a
statute
that
said,
a
person
becomes
a
defendant
as
soon
as
he...
one
state
has
a
statute
that
says
a
person
is
a
defendant
when
the
complaint
is
filed.
another
state
has
a
statute
that
says
a
person
is
not
a
defendant
until
he's
served
with
process.
unknown
speaker
so
that
even
if
a
state
had
a
statute
that
said,
you
are
a
defendant
when
the
complaint
is
filed,
that
would
not
be
controlling--
unknown
speaker
--and
i
suppose
your
opponent
would
make
the
same
answer
with
respect
to
the
other
statute.
unknown
speaker
is
it
clear
under
this
statute
that
the
complaint
has
to
be
filed
in
court,
or
can
it
just
be
something
drafted
in
the
lawyer's
office?
unknown
speaker
thank
you,
ms.
smith.
mr.
pugh,
we'll
hear
from
you.
mr.
pugh,
do
you
think
the
complaint
has
to
be
filed,
in
any
event,
under
this
statute?
unknown
speaker
what
if
the
complaint
in
this
case
had
been
obtained
not
by
the
intentional
act
of
faxing
it,
but
by
a
different
means?
what
if
the
lawyer
for
the
defendant
had
simply
been
in
the
plaintiff's
lawyer's
office,
had
seen
a
copy
of
the
complaint
on
the
desk
of
his
opposing
counsel,
and
had
just
walked
away
with
it.
would
the
period
of
time
start
running
then?
unknown
speaker
okay.
it's--
unknown
speaker
--okay.
i'll
add
that
to
my
hypo.
it
has
been
filed,
but
it
has
not
been
served
and,
in
fact,
without
any
invitation
or
authority
defense
counsel
simply
picked
it
up
off
plaintiff's
counsel's
desk
and
said,
we'll
have
an
early
look,
and
walked
away
with
it.
would
the
period
start
running
then?
unknown
speaker
want
some
more--
unknown
speaker
--okay.
you
complete
my
hypothetical
for
me,
and
then
you
can
answer
it.
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
well,
i--
unknown
speaker
--okay,
but
how...
let's
get
back
to
my
hypothetical.
picks
it
up
off
the
desk--
unknown
speaker
--why
does
it
have
to
be
file-stamped?
unknown
speaker
so
in
other
words,
what
you're
getting
at
is,
there's
got
to
be
some
affirmative
indication
on
the
plaintiff's
part
that
the
plaintiff
is
going
ahead
with
this,
that
it's
a
real
lawsuit,
and
not
just
some
preliminary
pleadings
that
may
be...
may
or
may
not
be
used.
unknown
speaker
well,
also
some
evidence
of
authenticity,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
are
you
sure--
--well,
where
does
all
this
come
from
in
the
statute?
why
does
it...
the
statute
just
says
a
copy.
supposing
that
instead
of
mailing
a
file-stamped
copy
you
had
mailed
a...
just
an
office
copy
with
a
note
on
it,
this
is
a
copy
of
what
we
filed
today,
wouldn't
that
be
receipt
of
a
copy,
or
would
it,
in
your
view?
unknown
speaker
my
question
is
the
word
copy.
if
you
mail
a
verbatim
copy
of
the
paper
you
filed
in
there,
but
one
that
is
not
a
photostat
of
the
file-stamped
copy,
is
that
a
copy
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute?
unknown
speaker
yes,
the
copy...
it
is
pending.
unknown
speaker
well,
the
indicia
is
that
one
lawyer
trusts
another
lawyer
and
he
writes
a
letter
to
the
lawyer
saying,
this
is
what
i
filed
today.
that
generally
is
acceptable
among
reputable
counsel.
unknown
speaker
okay.
there
is--
--now,
my
second
question...
let
me
just...
please,
may
i
finish
with
this
one
thought.
the
usual
situation
that
i
was
familiar
with
in
practice
is,
before
you
file
the
complaint
you
will...
as
a
courtesy
you
will
sometimes
fill
out
and
mail
a
copy
to
the
intended
defendant
saying,
this
is
a
copy
of
what
i
propose
to
file.
it's
word
for
word
what
you
do
file
5
days
later.
then,
has
he
received...
and
then
5
days
later
he
becomes
a
defendant,
the
defendant.
has
the
defendant
received
a
copy
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute?
unknown
speaker
okay,
but
in--
--why
not?
literally
it
does.
why
wouldn't
it?
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
i'm
talking
about
what
he
has
in
his
possession
after
he
becomes
the
defendant.
he
has
a
copy
of
the
complaint.
he
has
received
a
copy
of
the
complaint,
and
he
is
a
defendant,
but
you
say
the
statute
doesn't
apply.
unknown
speaker
wait,
you
say
it
would
apply
once
it's
filed.
so
we
don't
follow
the
plain
language
in
all
cases.
i
thought
your
position
was,
it
would
apply
once
it's
filed,
when
he
receives
it.
5
days
before
the
complaint
is
filed
the
statute
is
not
complied
with,
but
if
he
gets
it
5
days
before,
and
then
later,
justice
stevens
goes
and
files
the
complaint,
as
he
said
he
would.
wouldn't,
at
that
point,
the
statute
be
complied
with?
he
would
have
received,
been
in
receipt
of
a
copy
of
the
initial
pleading.
unknown
speaker
then
look
at
what
happens
in
your
two
examples,
the
way
you
have
it.
example
one,
in
new
york,
somebody
serves,
the
plaintiff
serves
the
defendant.
8
days
later...
without
a
copy.
8
days
later,
he
sends
to
the
defendant,
who
receives
it,
a
copy
of
the
complaint,
but
not
file-stamped.
he
just
sent
it
from
his
office.
in
new
york,
under
your
theory,
the
period
doesn't
run.
i
mean,
we're
all
mixed
up,
aren't
we.
case
number
2...
maybe
it's
the
null
case.
the
null
case
may
be,
there
may
be
a
state
somewhere
where
you
can
actually
serve
someone
before
you
actually
begin
the
case.
is
there
such
a...
do
we
know
if
there
is
such
a
state?
unknown
speaker
we
don't
know.
so
all
we
have
to
have
is
a
state
where
it's
possible
to
serve
the
defendant
before
you
file
the
case.
then
what
happens?
what
you've
produced
is
an
interpretation
of
the
statute
which
will
get
people
very
mixed
up,
i
think.
and
indeed,
her
basic
claim,
your
opponent's,
is
the
only
way
that
we
won't
get
people
mixed
up,
finding
out,
you
know,
somebody
happened
to
get
a
copy
sent
by
a
paper
airplane,
and
it
went
in
the
office,
and
there
had
been
no
such
case
filed.
the
only
way
not
to
get
them
mixed
up
is
if
we
simply
read
the
word
otherwise
to
say,
otherwise
after
service.
that's
all.
otherwise
after
service,
and
then
nobody
gets
mixed
up,
it's
clear,
everybody
understands
it.
now,
i'm--
--the
difficulty
with
that
is,
it
doesn't
say
that.
no,
it
doesn't.
it
also
doesn't
say
otherwise
not
by
paper
airplane.
it
also
doesn't
say,
otherwise
and
we're
talking
in
the
united
states.
it
also
doesn't--
--and
it
also
isn't
her
position.
i
think
her
position
is
after
summons.
she
does
not
require
that
the
complaint
have
been
given.
what?
all
she
would
require
is
that
there
have
been
a
summons.
whether
or
not
the
person...
these
same
problems
arise
under
the
interpretation
that
the
other
side
would
give,
because
the
other
side
does
not
require
the
complaint
to
have
been
served.
no,
no,
the--
--the
other
side
only
requires
a
summons
to
have
been
issued,
with
or
without
a
complaint.
that's
true--
--but
with
the
copy
of
the
complaint
having
been
delivered.
other--
--and
the
ambiguity
is,
what
is
a
copy
of
the
complaint?
this
side
says
it's
got
to
file-stamped,
and
filed.
the
other
side
might
say
it
is
a
copy
if
it
has
the
same
language
in
it
word
for
word,
even
though
it's
delivered
ahead
of
time.
would
you
like
to
participate
in
the
court's
argument?
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
let
me
ask
you
this
question,
mr.
pugh.
you
agree
that
we
can't
read
the
statute
in
its
plainest
plain
meaning,
that
there
has
got
to
be
some
act
on
the
part
of
the
plaintiff
to
indicate
that
in
fact
a
real
lawsuit
is
being
filed,
rather
than
merely
drafted
pleadings
being
circulated.
i
mean,
that's
your
file-stamp
example.
we've
got
to
have
something
more.
assuming
that
to
be
a
sensible
position,
why
isn't
the
best
way
to
serve
that
end
to
say
that
there's
got...
as
your
opposing
counsel
says,
there's
got
to
be
a
service
officially
of
something
upon
the
defendant
so
the
defendant
knows
beyond
any
peradventure
of
doubt
that
a
real
lawsuit
has
been
commenced,
and
knows
that
at
that
point
he
better
look
at
the
rules
and
find
out
when
the
time
starts
running.
why
isn't
that
the
easiest
way
to
satisfy
what
she
claims
and
what
you
yourself
admit
has
got
to
be
something
more
than
merely
awareness
of
drafted
pleadings?
unknown
speaker
neither
does
stamping
of
the
complaint
appear.
in
other
words,
you're
importing
things,
too.
and
if
you're
going
to
import
things
for
the
very
sensible
purpose
of
saying,
we've
got
to
know
that
this
is
a
real
lawsuit
and
not
a
preliminary
drafting
exercise,
then
i'm
not
sure
why
we
should
stop
at
your
point
rather
than
her
point,
because
her
point
puts
somebody
definitively
on
notice,
and
yours
doesn't.
yours
has
the
problems
that
justice
breyer's
question
raises.
unknown
speaker
would
you
concede
it
was
triggered
by
that?
because
new
york,
with
serving
the
summons
but
not
the
complaint,
just
didn't
fit
into
this
scheme.
so
i
think
that
even
if
you
don't
even
look
at
legislative
history,
that's
conceded
that
congress
was
moved
by
people,
states
that
had
new
york's
pattern.
i
don't
know
of
any
other
one
that
did
at
the
time,
but--
unknown
speaker
--is
there
any
other...
to
decide
whether
congress
really
did
that,
i
wondered
whether
there's
any
other
instance
in
all
of
federal
procedure
where
a
defendant
is
required
to
do
something
on
pain
of
forfeiture,
because
if
you
don't
do
the
30
days,
then
you
can't
remove,
on
pain
of
forfeiture,
without
being
served
with
a
summons,
without
having
a
substitute
for
that
sheriff
seizing
you.
unknown
speaker
what
else?
unknown
speaker
not
improper.
it
didn't
happen.
unknown
speaker
but
that,
rule
12(b)(4)
or
(5)
is
a
responsive
pleading.
and
you're
not
required
to
respond
to
a
pleading
until
you're
made
a
defendant,
right?
unknown
speaker
i
thought
the
federal
rules
had
done
away
with
limited
and
special
appearances.
unknown
speaker
well,
suppose...
and
the
term
initial
pleading
may
help
your
case.
if
you
define
an
initial
pleading
as
a
paper
that
has
been
filed
in
the
court,
you
couldn't
have
a
copy
of
an
initial
pleading
unless
the
initial
pleading
had
been...
a
pleading
means
something
that's
been
filed
in
court.
unknown
speaker
does
it
always
mean
in
the
rules
a
piece
of
paper
that
has
on
it
a
time
stamp
or
the
equivalent?
unknown
speaker
i
mean,
one
could
have
a
copy
of
that
pleading
which
has
been
filed,
but
that
doesn't
indicate
on
it
that
it
has
been
filed.
unknown
speaker
perfect.
then
the--
unknown
speaker
--then
the
objective
indication
is
that
there
was
a
service.
unknown
speaker
no,
but
mr.
pugh,
you
said
they
totally
abandoned
service,
but
the
second
half
of
1446(b)
does
depend
on
time
of
service.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
they...
i'm
saying,
but
they
did
keep
it
for
that
case,
so
you
can't
say
they
abandoned
it.
unknown
speaker
so
do
i
understand
from
what
you've
said,
then...
you
get
the
fax
copy,
a
fax
copy
of
what
was
actually
filed
in
court,
so
what
the
chief
suggested
has
been
satisfied.
however,
30
days
go
by,
and
you
never
have
been
served
with
process.
on
day
40
you
are
served
with
process.
do
i
take
it
that
you
can't
remove
under
your
reading?
unknown
speaker
you've
got
this
fax,
this
courtesy
thing
that
was
sent
to
you.
then
there's
the
30
days
to
remove,
but
you
sit
there,
and
you
have
never
actually
gotten
any
kind
of
summons
at
all,
and
then
you
get
a
summons
on
day
40.
unknown
speaker
right.
your
point...
is
this
your
point?
i'm
beginning
to
see
what
i
think
i
missed
before.
you
say
that
the
case
has
to
have
begun,
so
that
if,
in
fact,
the
defendant
gets
a
copy
of
the
complaint,
but
gets
it
before
there's
been
any
filing
in
court,
that
nothing
happens,
it's
void,
it
doesn't
have
an
effect,
but
there
has
to
be
a
case
that's
begun.
now,
once
that
case
has
begun,
in
your
opinion,
the
copy
that
he
has
has
to
be
a
copy
that
he
knows
is
official,
and
if
he's
received
through
service
of
process
an
indication
the
case
has
begun,
that
will
probably
be
enough.
if
he
hasn't
received
that,
then
if
the
complaint
is
time-stamped
by
the
court,
that
will
give
him
the
necessary
notice
that
it's
official.
unknown
speaker
that's
your
point.
unknown
speaker
now,
i
come
from
a
state
that
justice
breyer
alluded
to
in
an
earlier
question
in
which
the
theory
is
that
the
suit
begins
not
upon
filing
in
court,
but
upon
service
on
the
defendants,
so
that
when,
in
fact,
the
copy
of
the
complaint
is
served
upon
the
defendant,
there
can't
be
any
date
stamp
because
you
don't
file
anything
in
court
until
you've
completed
your
service.
under
your
interpretation,
the
time
period
does
not
run
in
my
state,
i
take
it,
even
upon
service,
is
that
correct?
unknown
speaker
there's
no
stamp
on
it.
nothing's
been
filed
in
court.
does
the...
when
the
first
defendant
is
served,
does
the
30-day
period
start
running
as
to
that
defendant,
in
the
state
of
new
hampshire?
unknown
speaker
but
we
don't
know
if
any
state
allows
such
a
thing,
do
we?
well,
yeah.
i
come
from
one.
unknown
speaker
was
new
hampshire
admitted
yet?
[laughter]
if
you
have
a
state,
and
there
are
many
such
states,
where
the
statute
of
limitations
is
tolled
only
upon
service,
and
in
your
case,
if
the
defendant
gets
a...
in
many
cases
they're
filed
right
up
near
the
deadline.
in
your
case,
i
take
it,
you
would
require
the
defendant
to
remove
even
before
he's
served,
and
the
statute
of
limitations
may
later
run.
i
suppose
he
has
waived
the
statute
of
limitations
by
removing.
unknown
speaker
isn't
that
an
appearance
in
the
case?
is
the
removal
an
appearance,
is
it
not?
unknown
speaker
all
right.
i
mean,
i
don't
know...
what
you've
done,
which
is
very
interesting,
which
i
hadn't
quite
taken
in,
is
you've
worked
out
a
way
both
to
win
your
case
and
also
deal
with
most
of
the
practical
problem
that
they...
your
opponents
have
raised.
unknown
speaker
because
in
your
opinion,
it
can't
happen
that
you'd
file
these
informal
copies,
throw
them
through
the
window,
whatever.
i
understand
that.
but
now
i'm
sort
of
at
a
loss
to
decide
this
case.
that
is
to
say,
what...
either
way,
we
have
to
read
quite
a
lot
into
this
statute,
don't
we,
either
way.
and
then
i
guess
what
they
have
going
for
them
is
that
their
way
seems
more
commonly
accepted
than
the
way
you've
come
up
with.
unknown
speaker
what
they're
thinking
of,
imagine
a
big
office
with
about
100
people
in
it,
and
they
have
to
run
these
offices,
you
know.
it's
a
business.
it's
a
big
business
and
so
forth.
and
so
once
that
process
has
been
filed
people
are
on
notice,
and
if
they
start
getting
copies
of
complaints
after
that,
they'd
better
take
it
seriously,
but
the
fourth
assistant
may
not
know
the
significance
of
this
time
stamp.
unknown
speaker
so
in
the
case
of
the
government,
that
was
concerned
because
of
the
special
service
requirements
when
you're
suing
the
united
states,
would
you
say
the
complaint
then
would
have
to
be
actually
received
by
all
of
the
people
who
are
entitled
by
statute
to
be
served?
unknown
speaker
it's
consistent
with
your
position,
but
you
recognize
that
you're
doing
a
little
construing
of
the
meaning
of
the
word
copy.
it's
got
to
be
file-stamped.
and
you're
also
construing
the
word
receipt.
it's
got
to
be
received
by
a
person
authorized
to
take
service.
but
you
don't
think
there's
any
room
for
leeway
in
defining
the
term
defendant
to
include
someone
to
say
you're
not
a
defendant
until
you're
served
with
process.
unknown
speaker
so
your
literal...
your...
you
do
a
little
construing
for
two
words,
but
not
the
third.
unknown
speaker
no,
that's
true,
but
in
order...
one
might
say
that
in
order
to
make
sense
out
of
this
statute
and
solve
all
the
problems,
all
you
have
to
do
is
construe
the
word
defendant
for
purposes
of
this
statute
to
mean,
a
person
who
is
both
named
in
the
complaint
and
has
been
served
with
process.
if
you
construe
it
that
way,
all
the
problems
are
gone.
unknown
speaker
i
understand
that,
but
if
we
construed
it
that
way,
just
as
we
construe
copy
to
include
the
file
stamp
and
receipt
to
be
receipt
by
an
officer,
if
we
did
construe
it
that
way,
there'd
be
no
problem.
unknown
speaker
but
that's
not
true.
you
would
still
have
to
construe...
i
mean,
it's
not
whether
you
construe
defendant
instead
of
construing
the
other
two.
it's
whether
you
construe
defendant
in
addition
to
construing
the
other
two,
because
the
problems
as
to
whether
this
is
the
genuine
complaint
or
not
would
still
exist
even
if
the...
even
if
summons
without
a
copy
of
the
complaint
has
been
received,
and
the
problem
whether
you
can
serve
it
on
agents
of
the
federal
government,
set
forth
in
the
federal
statute,
whether
that
would
constitute
receipt,
those
problems
would
still
exist
even
if
a
summons
has
issued
without
the
complaint,
isn't
that
right?
unknown
speaker
so--
--but
they're
not
very
difficult
problems.
unknown
speaker
before
we
go
to
the
unfairness,
i'm
thinking
back
to
1949
and
what
lawyers
and
judges
understood
about
the
state
asserting
its
power
over
an
individual.
that
required
something
official,
like
service,
so
why
shouldn't
we
think
that
that's
implicit?
it
was
set
so
strongly
in
the
common
law
tradition
that
the
state
must
assert
its
authority
over
you,
otherwise
you're
not
subject
to
the
state's
power,
and
it
wasn't
left
to
your
adversary
to
assert
that
power.
that
was,
i
think,
the
general
understanding
of
lawyers
and
judges
in
1949,
and
isn't
that
part
of
what
we
should
take
into
account?
unknown
speaker
and
he
would
be
able
to
challenge
the
service
immediately
in
federal
court,
instead
of
having
to
challenge
it
in
state
court.
unknown
speaker
may
i
just
confirm
one
other...
you
agree
the
word
defendant
is
a
matter
of
federal
definition,
not
state,
so
that
even
if
there
are
state
statutes
that
said,
you
don't
become
a
defendant
until
you're
served,
we
would
ignore
that
state
statute.
unknown
speaker
if
a
lawyer
for
a
prospective
defendant
finds
out
a
complaint's
been
filed
and
gets
it
for
his
own
client
and
sends
it
to
him,
i
suppose
he
could
be
in
big
trouble
under
your
interpretation.
unknown
speaker
so
if
you
go
down
yourself,
the
client
defending
himself,
to
the
courthouse
and
gets
a
certified
copy
of
the
complaint,
that's
not
enough.
unknown
speaker
maybe
they
did
that.
unknown
speaker
well,
it's
not
resolved
if
the
defendant's
lawyer
goes...
as
justice
kennedy's
example.
it's
not
resolved
for
my
case
of
a
copy
mailed
before
the
case
is
filed
at
all.
they're
still
open.
unknown
speaker
thank
you,
mr.
pugh.
ms.
smith,
you
have
3
minutes
remaining.
how
would
you
revise
this
statute
if
you
were
rewriting
it
so
that...
and
incorporate
your
client's
position?
i
mean,
that's
in
effect
what
you
want
us
to
do.
unknown
speaker
you
want
to
say,
after
receipt
by
the
defendant,
comma,
after
due
service,
comma--
unknown
speaker
the
honorable
court
is
now
adjourned
until
tomorrow
at
ten
o'clock.
