justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
this
case
concerned
a
time
limit.
the
time
allowed
a
defendant
named
in
a
state
court
lawsuit
to
remove
the
action
to
a
federal
court.
the
governing
measure
is
28
u.s.c.
ยง1446(b),
which
provides
that
the
removal
notice
shall
be
filed
within
30
days
after
the
receipt
by
the
defendant
through
service
or
otherwise
of
a
copy
of
the
complaint.
the
question
presented,
must
the
named
defendant
be
officially
summoned
to
court
before
the
time
to
remove
begins
or
does
the
removal
clock
starts
even
before
service
of
process
when
the
named
defendant
receives
a
faxed
copy
of
the
filed
complaint?
respondent
michetti
pipe
filed
a
complaint
against
petitioner
murphy
brothers
in
an
alabama
state
court.
three
days
later
michetti
faxed
a
courtesy
copy
of
the
filed
stamped
complaint
to
one
of
murphy's
vice
president,
nearly
two
weeks
after
that
michetti
officially
served
murphy.
30-days
after
service
but
44-days
after
receiving
the
faxed
copy
of
the
complaint,
murphy
removed
the
case
to
a
federal
district
court.
the
district
court
denied
michetti's
motion
to
remand
the
case
to
the
state
court,
but
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
eleventh
circuit
reversed
and
held
the
case
should
go
back
to
the
alabama
court.
defendant's
time
to
remove,
the
eleventh
circuit
held,
ran
from
murphy
brothers'
receipt
of
the
faxed
copy
of
the
filed
complaint
not
on
the
later
day
of
official
service.
we
reverse
the
court
of
appeals'
decision
and
hold
that
a
named
defendant's
time
to
remove
is
triggered
by
simultaneous
service
of
the
summons
and
complaint
or
receipt
of
the
complaint
after
service
of
the
summons,
but
not
by
mere
receipt
of
the
complaint
unattended
by
any
formal
service.
we
read
the
removal
prescription
in
light
of
a
bedrock
principle:
an
individual
or
entity
named
as
a
defendant
is
not
obliged
to
engage
in
litigation,
unless
notified
of
the
action
and
brought
under
a
court's
authority,
by
a
formal
process.
the
summons
continue
to
function
today
as
it
did
historically
as
the
courts
command
directing
an
individual
or
entity
to
participate
in
a
civil
action
or
forgo
procedural
or
substantive
rights.
when
congress
enacted
1446(b),
the
legislators
did
not
endeavor
to
break
away
from
that
traditional
understanding.
the
original
version
of
1446(b)
provided
that
the
petition
for
removal
maybe
filed
within
20
days
after
commencement
of
the
action
or
service
of
process,
whichever
is
later.
congress
soon
recognized
that
this
provision
created
problems
in
states
like
new
york,
where
service
of
the
summons
commences
the
action
and
that
service
could
precede
the
filing
of
the
complaint.
under
1446(b),
as
originally
enacted,
the
removal
time
in
new
york
could
have
expired
before
the
defendant
obtained
access
to
the
complaint.
to
prevent
this
from
happening
congress,
in
1949,
enacted
the
current
version
of
1446(b).
nothing
in
the
legislative
history
of
the
current
version
suggest
that
congress,
in
making
changes
to
accommodate
atypical
state
commencement
and
complaint
filing
procedures,
meant
to
dispense
with
the
historic
function
of
service
of
process
as
the
official
trigger
for
responsive
action
by
a
named
defender.
the
chief
justice
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion,
which
justice
scalia
and
justice
thomas
have
joined.
