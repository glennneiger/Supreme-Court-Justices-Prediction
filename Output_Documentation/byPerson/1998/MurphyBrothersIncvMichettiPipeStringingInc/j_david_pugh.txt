mr.
j.
david
pugh
justice
o'connor,
yes,
and
i
do
agree
that
the
requirement
for
filing
the
complaint
is
implicit
in
the
terms
and
initial
pleadings
setting
forth
a
removable
cause
of
action.
mr.
j.
david
pugh
justice
souter,
the
position
that
the
respondent
would
take
would
require
more
information.
for
example,
we
agree
that
by
initial
pleading
it
would
have
to
be
a
complaint
that
had
been
filed.
there
would
have
to
be
some
indicia
on
the
complaint
that
that
is
in
fact
the
case.
mr.
j.
david
pugh
so
there
would
need
to
be
a
file
stamp.
mr.
j.
david
pugh
again,
justice
souter,
a
few
more
facts--
mr.
j.
david
pugh
--might
be
necessary.
mr.
j.
david
pugh
well,
the
facts
in
the
case
before
the
court
are
the
ideal
situation
for
one
reason,
primarily.
mr.
j.
david
pugh
there's
nothing...
other
than
the
means
of
conveyance.
other
than
the
means
of
conveyance,
there
is
nothing
left
to
be
done
in
the
facts
before
the
case.
mr.
j.
david
pugh
it
would
need
to
be
file-stamped.
we
believe
rule
11
would
require--
mr.
j.
david
pugh
--that's
an
indicia
that
the
action
is
actually
pending
against
the
defendant.
mr.
j.
david
pugh
yes.
mr.
j.
david
pugh
yes,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
j.
david
pugh
the
extent
to
which
courts
may
have
to
go
in
interpreting
receipt
does
present
some
problems--
mr.
j.
david
pugh
--if,
in
fact,
there
is...
if,
in
fact,
the
action
is
pending
against
the--
mr.
j.
david
pugh
--and
there
is
some
indicia
on
the
face
of
the
complaint--
mr.
j.
david
pugh
--a
court
could
find
that
that
is
enough.
mr.
j.
david
pugh
we
do
not
think
that
on
those
facts,
that
the
language
in
the
statute
would
extend
to
those
facts.
mr.
j.
david
pugh
there's
no
action
pending.
it's
not
an
initial
pleading.
he
is
not
a
defendant.
he
might
become
one
at
some
point.
mr.
j.
david
pugh
the
language
of
the
statute--
mr.
j.
david
pugh
--justice
scalia,
the
action...
i'm
going
to
create
some
language
of
my
own...
would
be
inchoate.
there's
no
safeguard
against
further
editing
of
the
complaint.
there's
no
assurance,
the
defendant
would
have
no
assurance
that
what
he
had,
which
was
a
conception
of
an
action,
of
an
initial
pleading,
to
use
the
language
of
the
statute,
was,
in
fact,
or
did
evolve
into
an
initial
pleading
or
an
action.
mr.
j.
david
pugh
i
don't
know
of
such
a--
mr.
j.
david
pugh
--i'm
enjoying...
i'm
enjoying
the
discussion.
mr.
j.
david
pugh
justice
souter,
i
think
this
will
answer
both
yours
and
justice
breyer's
question.
in
the
words
of
mr.
chief
justice,
quite
simply,
the
petitioner
asks
this
court
to
import
the
phrase,
not
service,
but
service
of
process
into
this
statute.
the
words,
service
of
process,
do
not
appear
in
the
statute.
they
were
there
in
'48.
mr.
j.
david
pugh
in
1948,
prior
to
the
1949
amendment,
the
removal
statute
expressly
adopted
a
service
of
process
methodology
to
commence
the
running
of
the
time.
congress
very
quickly
recognized
the
same
difficult
situations
with
hypotheticals.
they
had
some
real
examples
before
them.
but
we
think
it's
improper
to
conclude,
and
the
legislative
history
certainly
doesn't
indicate
that
the
conclusion
is
well-founded,
that
the
change
in
'49
was
limited
solely
to
new
york
and
kentucky.
mr.
j.
david
pugh
yes,
those
were
the
immediate
problems.
but
to
solve
the
problem,
what
congress
did
was
abandon,
abandon
service
of
process,
and
opt
instead
for
what
they
hoped
would
be
a
uniform
federal
standard,
and
that's
the
receipt--
mr.
j.
david
pugh
--justice
ginsburg,
we
believe
the
answer
is
yes.
in
fact
that's--
mr.
j.
david
pugh
--that's
the
answer
to
the
rule
81(c)
problem.
if
a
defendant
believes
he
has
been
improperly
served,
or
that
process
was
improper--
mr.
j.
david
pugh
--it
didn't
happen,
but
nonetheless,
he's
received
the
complaint.
the
proper
procedure,
and
in
fact
it's
been
the
policy
of
the
courts
consistently,
is
to
resolve
that
issue
quickly
by
exercising
a
rule
12(b)(4)
or
(b)(5)
right.
in
fact,
the
eleventh
circuit
has
a
case
where--
mr.
j.
david
pugh
--just
by
way
of
one
example,
the
eleventh
circuit
has
held
to
the
contrary,
and
moore's
echoes
that
as
a
general
policy,
that
in
those
limited
instances,
and
it's
a
limited
appearance,
you
go...
the
proper
procedure
is
to
go
and
challenge
that.
if
the
defendant
is
correct--
mr.
j.
david
pugh
--i
use
an
archaic
term,
but
that
in
effect
is
what
it
is.
you
go
and
challenge
the
sufficiency
of
the
service.
if
service
was
improper,
that
defendant
is
done.
mr.
j.
david
pugh
mr.
chief
justice,
that's
precisely
the
definition
we
would
opt
for.
mr.
j.
david
pugh
it
would
need
to
have--
mr.
j.
david
pugh
--even
if
it
did
not,
but
the
defendant
had
some
other
objective
indicia
that
an
action
was
pending,
such
as
the
summons
that
was
date-stamped,
and
an
undate-stamped--
mr.
j.
david
pugh
--those
two
together,
then
it's
got--
mr.
j.
david
pugh
--in
that
limited
example.
but
what
congress
wanted
to
do
in
'49
is
move
away
from
that
problem
and
opt
for
a
receipt,
a
uniform
receipt.
mr.
j.
david
pugh
the
second
phrase,
which
speaks
of
service
of
a
summons?
mr.
j.
david
pugh
and
that,
in
fact,
is
where...
the
only
place
that
a
service
of
process
requirement
is
imposed.
mr.
j.
david
pugh
which,
when
contrasted
with
the
first
part
of
the
statute,
affirms
the
respondent's
position
that
in
those
cases
when
a
summons
has
not
been
served,
which
expressly
contemplates
that
the
situation
could
arise,
then
all
that's
needed,
and
what
congress
thought
was
most
important,
was
receipt
of
a
pleading
that
gave
that
defendant
notice
that
a
removable
cause
of
action
was
pending.
now,
often--
mr.
j.
david
pugh
--if
you've
received
the
complaint,
it
was...
an
action
had--
mr.
j.
david
pugh
--under
the
plain
meaning
of
the
present
version
of
section
1446,
that
defendant
would
have
waived
the
right
of
removal.
now,
it's
always
been
recognized
that
it
was
a
limited
and
waivable
right.
it
hasn't
lost
any
due
process.
it
can
still
appear
in
court.
it
still
has
a
right
to
trial
by
jury,
a
right
to
be
represented
by
counsel,
the
rules
of
evidence,
rules
of
civil
procedure,
the
appellate
rights
that
it
would
have.
it's
just
lost
that
limited,
waivable
right
to
an
alternative
form.
now,
the
assertion
that
the
1949
amendment
was
a
major
change,
and
in
fact
the
senate
report
refers
to
it
as
a
major
change,
is
consistent
with
a
longer
view
of
the
legislative
history
of
the
removal
right.
in
the
earliest
years,
a
defendant
could
exercise
that
right
all
the
way
up
until
the
time
of
trial.
it
was
there
because
of
the
perception
of
local
prejudice.
down
through
the
years,
as
the
perception,
hopefully
reality
of
local
prejudice
abated,
congress
has
consistently
drawn
back
the
time
in
which
that
right
must
be
exercised.
mr.
j.
david
pugh
yes,
justice
breyer.
mr.
j.
david
pugh
precisely.
mr.
j.
david
pugh
the
action--
mr.
j.
david
pugh
--in
your
hypothetical
case,
i
think
not.
an
action
had
not
been
commenced.
now,
again,
the
facts
of
the
case--
mr.
j.
david
pugh
--justice
souter's
example
suggested
that
it
did.
mr.
j.
david
pugh
i
don't
know
of
a
case
to
cite
for
the
proposition,
but
i
think
that
would
be
an
incorrect
proposition,
justice
kennedy,
to
the
same
extent
that
one
does
not
waive
rule
12
defenses.
the
mere...
the
act
of
removing--
mr.
j.
david
pugh
--yes,
for
a
limited
purpose.
in
essence,
if
i
could
use
a
colloquialism,
it's
reserving
a
seat
at
the
opera.
it's
saying,
if
i
do...
if
i
do
have
to
proceed
with
a
full
defense
on
the
merits
in
this
case,
i
am
now
asserting
my
right
to
proceed
in
the
federal
forum
as
opposed
to
the
state
forum.
that's
all
that's
taking
place.
if
service
has
not
been
achieved,
the
proper
procedure
is
to
pursue...
file
a
motion
under
rule
12.
mr.
j.
david
pugh
yes.
mr.
j.
david
pugh
to
the
extent
that
a
court
is
interpreting
receipt,
or
initial
pleading,
the
importation
of
some
meaning
is
a
proper
inquiry,
we
would
suggest.
the
importation
of
the
phrase,
service
of
process,
which
was
there
expressly,
and
just
as
expressly
abandoned
in
1949,
is
a
much
longer
leap,
if
you
will,
farther
leap.
mr.
j.
david
pugh
well,
in
the
facts
of
our
case,
the
person
who
actually
received
it,
whether
under
the
alabama
rules
or
the
federal
rules,
is
a
person
upon
whom
service
could
be
effected.
we
agree,
as
the
sixth
circuit,
the
first
circuit
to
address
this,
pronounced
in
its
opinion,
that
recognizing
that
a
corporation
is
a
legal
entity
that
must
act
through
its
human
agents,
they
had
to
decide
upon
whom
this
receipt
determination
could
be
evaluated,
and
they
suggested,
it
ought
to
be
a
person
upon
whom
service
could
be
effected.
that's
not
offensive
to
our
position,
it's
consistent
with
our
position,
but
that's
an
interpretation
of
the
word
receipt,
which
is
in
the
statute.
mr.
j.
david
pugh
we
think
so,
and
that's
consistent
with
our
position.
mr.
j.
david
pugh
well--
mr.
j.
david
pugh
--we
think,
in
fact,
the
defendant,
the
use
of
the
word
defendant
in
1446
is
consistent
with
the
broader
meaning.
as
it
was
observed,
defendant
without
the
qualifying
language
does
appear
in
several
other
instances,
the
removal
act.
mr.
j.
david
pugh
but
justice
stevens,
those
words
aren't
there.
mr.
j.
david
pugh
and
congress
could
have
opted
for
that.
mr.
j.
david
pugh
that's
correct.
mr.
j.
david
pugh
and
it
hits
upon
what
we
believe
congress
thought
was
the
primary
reason
for
the
changes.
their
inquiry
was
directed
at
communicating,
conveying,
transferring
to
the
defendant
the
notice
that
a
removable
cause
of
action
was
pending
against
it,
and
that's
when
they
opted
for
this,
as
the
senate
report
said,
a
major
change
in
the
previous
methodology
from
the
service
of
process.
there
has
been
much
discussed
with
respect
to
the
perceived
unfairness
in
some
of
the
extreme
hypotheticals.
the
eleventh
circuit
recognized
that
the
unfairness,
to
the
extent
it
was
present,
was--
mr.
j.
david
pugh
--that
is
a
proper
analysis
of
the
need
for
the
mandate,
in
fact,
for
the
service
of
process,
but
that
is
not
implicated
in
the
removal
scenario.
all
one
is
doing
is
preserving,
taking
out
that
ticket,
preserving
the
right
to
proceed
if
in
fact
service
is
properly
effected
subsequent
to
the
actual
removal,
reserving
the
right
to
proceed
in
the
federal
forum.
the
only
thing
that
that
defendant
must
do,
and
there
are
cases
holding
this,
that
it
can
be
waived
if
this
is
not
exercised,
is
going
and
challenging
the
service
or
the
process
under
rule
12
(b)(4)
or
(5).
if
that
defendant
is
right
that
he
was
not
served
or
was
improperly
served,
that
action
is
concluded
in
all
instances,
and
we
can
assume
it
would
be
without
prejudice,
and
it
might
be
effected
later.
if
he's
wrong,
that
action
would
then
proceed,
but
he's
preserved
his
right
to
remove,
and
all
is
well.
mr.
j.
david
pugh
that's
correct.
mr.
j.
david
pugh
my
inclination,
without
thinking
about
all
the
possible
ramifications,
is
that
we
are
talking
about
the
federal
right
of
removal,
a
limited,
waivable
right,
and
if
we
have
to
construe
that
word
for
purposes
of
determining
whether
a
receipt
has
occurred,
i
would
be
inclined
to
go
with
the
federal
definition.
mr.
j.
david
pugh
it
would
depend
upon
how
far
the
district
courts
would
go
in
interpreting
receipt.
we
suggested
in
our
brief
that
that
implies
an
affirmative
act.
we
had
to
address
the
hypotheticals.
the
facts
in
our
case
do
not
involve
that,
but
we
suggest
it
implies
an
affirmative
act
on
the
part
of
the
plaintiff,
not
unlike
an
attempt
at
service,
but
it's
not
necessary
to
reach
that.
mr.
j.
david
pugh
in
fact,
that's
what
happens
in
a
state
like
kentucky.
the...
it's
incumbent
upon
the
defendant
to
go
and
see
if
the
pleading
states
a
removable
cause
of
action
so
that
he
may
then
exercise
his
removal
rights
if
they're
proper.
again,
the
import...
what
congress
recognized
in
1949
and
has
echoed
in
both
the
senate
and
the
house
report,
is
that
we've
got
a
parade
of
horribles
with
the
service
of
process
hypotheticals
just
as
you
can
imagine
under
the
receive
analysis,
but
we're
going
to
abandon
that
service
of
process
methodology,
because
that
is
clearly
tied
to
50
different
states'
rules.
we're
going
to
adopt
a
new
methodology,
and
that's
going
to
be
based
upon
receipt
of
an
initial
pleading
that
sets
forth
a
removable
cause
of
action,
because
our
intent
in
1446(b)
is
to
get
notice
to
that
defendant
that
it
had
better
do
something
or
risk
waiving
its
removal
rights,
and
that,
at
least
the
1949
congress
thought
was
best
achieved
by
requiring
receipt,
and
moving
away
from
the
service
of
process,
a
phrase
that
it
dropped
entirely.
it
had
been
the
sole
methodology
in
the
statute
the
year
before,
and
it
moved
away.
in
fact,
if
all
congress
intended
to
do
was
to
solve
the
new
york/kentucky
problem,
a
semicolon
provided
comma
however
clause
at
the
end
of
the
1948
statute
would
have
been
the
best
manner,
saying
provided,
however,
that
in
those
states
in
which
a
complaint,
an
initial
pleading
setting
forth
the
removable
cause
of
action,
is
not
required
to
be
filed
or
served
until
later.
then
the
time
will
run
when
that
is
received,
or
served,
or
whatever
methodology
they
chose.
mr.
j.
david
pugh
there's
no
indication
in
the
legislative
history.
it's
just...
it's
erased,
and
they
started
from
scratch.
i
was
about
to
address
the
unfairness
issue.
we
think
the
eleventh
circuit
correctly
pointed
out
that
the
unfairness
concerns
are
largely
if
not
completely
addressed
when
the
state
of
the
law
is
settled.
all
it
will
take
is
for
this
court
to
adopt
and
enunciate
the
receipt
rule
and
the
uncertainty
that
litigants
have
as
to
what
to
do
is
then
resolved.
mr.
j.
david
pugh
again,
we
think
the
initial
pleading,
justice
stevens,
the
initial
pleading
only
would
require
that
the
action
actually
be
commenced.
