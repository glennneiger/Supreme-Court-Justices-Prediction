ms.
deborah
a.
smith
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
the
30-day
time
period
for
removal
begins
to
run
when
a
named
defendant
receives
a
copy
of
the
complaint
if
service
of
process
has
not
yet
been
perfected.
28
u.s.c.
section
1446(b)
requires
that
notice
of
removal
be
filed
within
30
days
after
the
receipt
by
the
defendant,
through
service
or
otherwise,
of
a
copy
of
the
initial
pleading.
relying
upon
the
plain
meaning
of
the
words,
receipt
through
service
or
otherwise,
the
eleventh
circuit
held
that
the
removal
period
commences
when
a
named
party
comes
into
possession
of
a
copy
of
the
complaint,
even
if
service
has
not
been
made.
we
submit
to
the
court
that,
when
read
as
a
whole
and
in
conjunction
with
the
other
removal
statutes,
section
1446(b)
is
ambiguous.
the
ambiguity
arises
from
the
use
of
the
term,
defendant.
a
defendant
can
mean
either
a
named
party,
a
party
who
is
named
as
the
defendant
in
the
complaint,
or
it
can
mean,
in
more
proper
sense,
one
who
has
been
made
a
party
defendant
through
service
of
process.
in
section
1441(b),
congress
used
the
term
defendant
in
the
narrower
sense.
1441(b)
states
that
parties
in
interest...
or
uses
the
phrase,
parties
in
interest
who
have
been
properly
joined
and
served
as
defendants.
ms.
deborah
a.
smith
yes,
sir.
ms.
deborah
a.
smith
in
1441(b),
the
second
sentence
states
that
any
such
action,
any
other
such
action
shall
be
removable
only
if
none
of
the
parties
in
interest
properly
joined
and
served
as
defendants
is
a
citizen
of
the
state
in
which
such
action
is
brought.
ms.
deborah
a.
smith
i
think
it
is...
i
don't
think
it
is...
was
intended
as
a
definitional
provision.
i
think
it
is
a
demonstration
that
congress
was
using
the
term
there
in
a
narrow
sense,
and
suggests
that
perhaps
congress
was
using
that
term
in
a
narrow
sense
in
section
1446(b)
as
well.
ms.
deborah
a.
smith
well,
i--
ms.
deborah
a.
smith
--well,
i
think
it...
i
disagree
with
you.
i
think
it
does
help,
because
i
think
it
demonstrates
that
congress
felt
a
need
to
articulate
in
what
sense
it
was
using
the
term,
defendant,
in
recognition
that
a
defendant
as...
in
common
usage
a
defendant
can
mean,
anybody
who
is
named
as
a
defendant
in
a
complaint,
and
doesn't
necessarily
infer
only
a
defendant
who
has
been
properly
joined.
ms.
deborah
a.
smith
well,
our
argument
is
that
it
suggests,
by
the
use
of
the
term
defendant
in
1441(b),
it
suggests
that
congress
was
using
the
narrow
term
defendant
in
1446(b)
as
well.
i
think
it
demonstrates
the
ambiguity
in
the
term.
ms.
deborah
a.
smith
well,
in
1441(b)
we're
dealing
with
more
than
just
parties
who
are
named
as
defendants,
because
we're
talking
about
parties
in
interest,
and
that
could
possibly
be
someone
other
than
someone
who
has
actually
been
named
as
a
defendant
in
the
complaint.
ms.
deborah
a.
smith
well,
i
think
you're
correct.
i
think
in
1448
congress
was
using
the
term
in
the
broader
sense,
in
recognition
that
there
would
be
cases
where
a
case
had
been
removed
and
either
the
defendant
who
removed
it
had
not
been
properly
served,
or
where
there
were
other
defendants--
ms.
deborah
a.
smith
--who
hadn't
been
served
at
all.
ms.
deborah
a.
smith
i
think
it
is
a
recognition
that
that
can
happen,
but
it
just...
it
further
demonstrates
to
me
the
ambiguity
of
the
term
defendant.
ms.
deborah
a.
smith
i
don't
think
so,
because
even
if
we
assume
that
a
defendant
can
only
remove,
that
there
couldn't
be
an
early
removal
by
a
defendant
who
received
a
copy
of
the
complaint,
decided
to
go
ahead
and
remove
it
even
though
his
time
had
not
begun
to
run
under
a
service
interpretation.
aside...
taking
that
instance
aside,
there
are
cases
where
a
defendant's
time
begins
to
run
because
he
has
been
served
with
process,
and
there
are
other
defendants
in
the
suit
that
haven't
been
served,
so
1448
deals
with
those
other
defendants
who
have
not
been
served.
ms.
deborah
a.
smith
i
think
1448
does
apply
to
someone
who
has
been
named
but
not
served,
but--
ms.
deborah
a.
smith
--your
honor,
81(c)
is
a...
poses
a
real
significant
problem
if
the
language,
receipt
through
service
or
otherwise,
means
receipt
without
service.
ms.
deborah
a.
smith
yes,
it
does.
ms.
deborah
a.
smith
correct.
if...
and
that
language
was
added
to
rule
81(c)
contemporaneously
with
the
amendment
of
1446(b)
for
the
purpose
of
consistency,
so
it
certainly
should
be
interpreted
to
mean
the
same
thing.
if
it
means
only
receipt
in
the
absence
of
service,
then
it
puts
the
defendant
in
the
position
of
having
to
respond,
not
just
remove
the
case
without
service
but
respond
to
the
complaint
without
service.
ms.
deborah
a.
smith
i
believe
that
the
idea
that
congress
was
trying
to
set
forth
was
that
in
a
state
where
the
complaint
is
served
with
the
summons
your
time
runs
from
receipt
through
service.
in
other
states,
where
you
do
not
receive
the
complaint
with
the
summons,
then
it
runs
from
receipt
by
some
other
means.
ms.
deborah
a.
smith
correct.
ms.
deborah
a.
smith
well--
ms.
deborah
a.
smith
--well,
the
second
clause
in
1446(b)
was
added
to
deal
with
a
peculiarity
in
kentucky
where
the
complaint
is
filed
in
court,
but
it
never
has
to
be
served
on
the
defendant.
ms.
deborah
a.
smith
so
if
they
didn't
put
in
a
specific
provision,
the
defendant's
time
in
kentucky
would
never
begin
to
run,
because
he
never
would
receive
a
copy
of
the
complaint
or
it
could,
that
situation
could
occur,
and
that
is
the
purpose
of
adding
that
language
to
the
second
phrase.
ms.
deborah
a.
smith
correct.
ms.
deborah
a.
smith
the
kentucky
situation,
correct.
ms.
deborah
a.
smith
in
new
york,
the
defendant...
the
complaint
was
filed
and
the...
and
service
of
process
was
perfected
without
filing
or
serving
a
complaint--
ms.
deborah
a.
smith
--but
ultimately
a
complaint
had
to
be
filed
and
served.
the
defendant
ultimately
did
receive
a
copy
of
the
complaint.
ms.
deborah
a.
smith
no.
in--
ms.
deborah
a.
smith
--that's
right.
you
institute
a
suit
by
filing
a
summons,
and
i
think
the
procedure
has
changed
now,
but
at
that
time
you
instituted
a
suit
by
filing
a
summons
and
serving
it
on
the
defendant,
without
any
requirement
that
the
complaint
be
filed
or
served,
so
the
difference
is,
in
kentucky
a
defendant
could
go
to
the
courthouse
and
get
a
copy
of
the
complaint.
in
new
york,
the
complaint
wasn't
necessarily
there
for
the
defendant
to
go
get
it.
ms.
deborah
a.
smith
it
did
not
have
to
be
filed
in
the
clerk's
office
when
the
case
was
commenced,
that's
correct.
ms.
deborah
a.
smith
well,
i
think
that
the
problems
in
interpreting
the
or
otherwise
language
are
much
less
significant
if
service
of
process
has
already
been
perfected,
because
then
you
don't
have
the
same
kinds
of
concerns
about
whether
the
defendant
has
actually
gotten
notice
that
there
is
a
formal
proceeding
against
him.
ms.
deborah
a.
smith
i--
ms.
deborah
a.
smith
--i
have
not
been
able
to
come
up
with
any
narrow
meaning
of
the
phrase,
or
otherwise.
ms.
deborah
a.
smith
i
believe
that's
correct.
ms.
deborah
a.
smith
correct.
ms.
deborah
a.
smith
that's
correct.
ms.
deborah
a.
smith
that's
correct.
ms.
deborah
a.
smith
correct.
ms.
deborah
a.
smith
that's
correct.
ms.
deborah
a.
smith
that...
i
believe
that's
correct.
i
think
that's
a
proper
interpretation
by
reason
of,
who
is
a
defendant.
ms.
deborah
a.
smith
no.
it
didn't
in
new
york,
and
that
was
the
very
problem
that
they
were
addressing.
now--
ms.
deborah
a.
smith
--no.
the...
a
summons
had
to
be
served
in
new
york.
a
summons
was
served
when
the
case
was
commenced,
but
it
did
not
require
that
the
complaint
be
attached
to
it.
ms.
deborah
a.
smith
nor
did
the
complaint
have
to
be
filed
in
court.
ms.
deborah
a.
smith
serving
it--
ms.
deborah
a.
smith
--serving
the
complaint
at
some
other
time
after
service
of
process.
ms.
deborah
a.
smith
i
think
or
otherwise
can
mean
any
other...
other
way,
and
if
service
of
process
has
been
perfected
to
deal
with
the
new
york
rule.
ms.
deborah
a.
smith
right.
you
must
have
service,
and
if
you
do
have
service,
the
problems
with
notice
aren't
there.
the
defendant
is
on
notice
once
service
has
been
made.
he
has
been
properly--
ms.
deborah
a.
smith
--i
disagree,
because
i
think
defendant
was
intended
to
mean
only
a
defendant
who
had
been
made
a
defendant
through
service
of
process.
ms.
deborah
a.
smith
no.
no,
i
don't
think
that
anybody
has
asserted
that
you
waive
personal
jurisdiction.
the
problem
with
rule
81(c),
though,
is
that
our
history
and
our
federal
procedures
and
our
understanding
of
the
law
is
that
a
defendant
doesn't
have
to
do
anything
until
he's
been
properly
served
with
process.
ms.
deborah
a.
smith
well,
he
has
to
file
a
responsive
pleading,
and
he
may
say
in
his
responsive
pleading,
rule
12(b),
i
haven't
been
properly
served,
yes.
ms.
deborah
a.
smith
could
waive
service,
in
other
words.
ms.
deborah
a.
smith
yes,
i
think
that's
correct,
but
a...
an
interpretation
that
requires
service
and
receipt
i
think
is
the
most
consistent
with
the
legislative
history
and
it
also
avoids
the
problems
with
rule
81(c),
and
it
also
comports
with
fundamental
fairness.
ms.
deborah
a.
smith
no...
well,
certainly
you
could
be
an
improperly
joined,
misjoined--
ms.
deborah
a.
smith
--defendant,
but
i
don't--
ms.
deborah
a.
smith
--i...
yes,
absolutely.
ms.
deborah
a.
smith
because
that's
what
gives
the
court
jurisdiction
over
you.
i
mean,
that
is
what,
in
our
history,
the...
has
told
the
defendant
that
he
had
to
take
action.
before
service
of
process
was
made,
a
defendant
didn't
have
to
do
anything.
it
didn't
matter
if
he
knew
that
that
suit
was
sitting
out
there
against
him.
until
he
had
been
served
with
process
he
didn't
have
to
do
anything,
and
i
think
congress
was
acting
with
that
understanding
in
amending
in
1949.
they
understood
that
a
defendant
doesn't
have
to
do
anything.
a
defendant
is
truly
a
defendant
only
when
he
has
been
served
with
process.
ms.
deborah
a.
smith
they
are
defendants
for
determining
diversity
jurisdiction--
ms.
deborah
a.
smith
--whether
diversity
jurisdiction,
because
you
have
to
look
at
everybody--
ms.
deborah
a.
smith
--in
the...
named
in
the
complaint.
ms.
deborah
a.
smith
well,
i
can't
answer
that.
ms.
deborah
a.
smith
correct.
ms.
deborah
a.
smith
correct.
ms.
deborah
a.
smith
so
if...
certainly
if
a
lawsuit
is
filed
in
federal
court
the...
on
diversity
grounds,
and
they
have
named
a
nondiverse
defendant,
they
can
drop
that
defendant,
correct.
ms.
deborah
a.
smith
correct.
ms.
deborah
a.
smith
that's
correct.
ms.
deborah
a.
smith
well,
i
don't
disagree
that
congress
could
do
that.
they
could
say
that
yes,
you
have
to
remove
before
you
have
been
served
with
process.
i
think
the
question,
though,
is
that
what
they
intended
in
1949.
ms.
deborah
a.
smith
well,
correct,
but
if
we
get
past
the
ambiguity
issue,
then
we
do
need
to
look
at
what
they
intended
by
their
language.
and
i
think
in
1949,
when
they
amended
this
statute,
all
they
were
trying
to
do
was
correct
a
very
narrow
problem.
and
in
1948,
when
the
statutes
were...
title
28
was
reconfiled
and
revised
in
1928...
in
1948,
excuse
me,
they
specifically
tied
the
removal
time
to
state
rules
of
service
and
commencement,
so
i
think
any
suggestion
that
they
were
trying
to
divorce
the
removal
statutes,
or
the
removal
procedure
from
the
state
rules
of
service
is
incorrect.
they
specifically
tied
it
to
that
in
1948.
in
1949,
they
were
trying
to
only
correct
this
very
specific
problem
of
a
defendant
who
had
been
served,
the
suit
had
been
commenced,
but
he
didn't
have
any
means
of
determining
whether
his
suit
was
removable,
and
that
is
the
problem
that
they
were
trying
to
correct.
ms.
deborah
a.
smith
i
think
it
is
an
issue...
for
1446
purposes
and
for
removal
purposes
it
is
an
issue
of
federal
law,
who
is
a
defendant
under
federal
law.
ms.
deborah
a.
smith
i
think
that's--
ms.
deborah
a.
smith
--well,
i
mean,
what
we
have
to
look
at
is
who
is
a
defendant
under
1446(b),
and
that
has
got
to
be
an
issue
of
federal
law.
requiring
both
service
and
receipt
is
consistent
with
fundamental
fairness.
it
is...
it
voids
a
lot
of
difficult
interpretive
problems
that
result
from
solely
a
receipt
rule.
the
lower
courts
have
begun
superimposing
the
service-type
ideas
on
top
of
the
term
receipt
in
order
to
deal
with
the
concerns
about
whether
the
defendant
has
notice,
the
proper
notice
in
order
to
put
him
on
notice
that
he
needs
to
do
something
in
respond
to
the...
in
response
to
the
complaint
when
he
just
receives
it
by
fax
or
by
mail
without
the
formal
procedures
attendant
to
service
of
process.
we
submit
to
you
that
that
approach
makes
no
sense,
because
if
congress
did,
indeed,
intend
receipt
to
mean
any
receipt,
then
superimposing
service
rules
on
top
of
what
receipt
is
is
contrary
to
congressional
intent,
so--
ms.
deborah
a.
smith
--i
think
that
that
is
tied
to
the
use
of
the
term
initial
pleading.
and
while
i
think
that
ordinarily
an
initial
pleading
would
have
to
be
filed
in
court,
i
don't
know
if
there
were
some
quirky
states...
i
mean,
what
we
were
dealing
with
was
quirky
service
and
receipt
rules,
i
hesitate
to
use
that
term,
but
in
the
state
courts,
and
i
do
not
know
if
there
was
some
state
where
you
did
not
have
to
file
your
initial
pleading,
but
i
think
ordinarily
the
initial
pleading
would
be
a
complaint
that
had
been
filed,
already
filed
in
state
court.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i'll
reserve
my
time.
ms.
deborah
a.
smith
well,
i
certainly
would
not
suggest
that
i
am
a
drafter
of
statutes.
i
think
there
certainly
are
ways
that
this
statute
could
have
been
better
worded.
ms.
deborah
a.
smith
i
would
have
said,
receipt
or
service,
whichever
is
later.
that
still
wouldn't
deal
with
the
kentucky
problem.
the
second
phrase
would
still
have
to
be
put
in,
but
i
think
that
would
be
better
language.
but
i
don't
think
that
congress
always
uses
what
we
think
to
be
the
best
language,
and
i
don't
think
that
indicates
that
is
necessarily
not
what
they
intended.
i
think
the
respondent's
suggestion
that
the
1949
amendment
was
intended
to
make
a
major
change...
and
he's
correct,
there
is
a
sentence
in
the
legislative
history
that
says
this
makes
a
major
change,
but
it
made
a
major
change
in
the
context
of
the
bill
in
which
the
statute
was
amended.
there
were
174
changes
made
to
the
1948
statutes,
and
in
that
context
it
was
a
major
change
because
about
170
of
those
were
typographical
errors
and
clerical
errors
that
were
being
corrected.
there's
nothing...
what
the
legislative
history
indicates
is
that
congress'
concern
was
dealing
with
this
new
york
problem,
dealing
with
the
question
of
what
happens
if
the
defendant
doesn't
have
a
copy
of
the
complaint
from
which
to
determine
that
his
case
is
removable.
there's
nothing
to
indicate
that
they
wanted
to
completely
divorce
the
removal
provisions
from
state
service
of
process
rules.
i
think
in
addressing
the
fundamental
fairness
question,
i
think
there
are
circumstances
where
the
process
would
be
fundamentally
unfair
even
under
mr.
pugh's
interpretation
of
the
other
terms
within
the
statute.
for
example,
a
foreign
corporation,
a
defendant
receives...
a
foreign
defendant
corporation
receives
a
faxed
copy
of
a
file-stamped
complaint.
well,
they
don't
necessarily...
they
can't
even
necessarily
read
it.
there
certainly
is
no
reason
that
they
should
understand
the
significance
of
it
and
know
that
they
have
to
act
immediately
to
protect
their
interests.
under
the
service
rules,
those
kinds
of
issues
are
taken
care
of.
a
foreign
defendant
is
normally
served
under
the
hague
convention,
or
most
of
them
are,
and
it
requires
that
the
allegations
of
the
complaint
be
translated
into
their
language,
and
that
the
complaint
be...
summons
and
complaint
be
sent
to
a
central
location,
which
is
usually
the
consulate,
from
which
formal
service
is
made.
