justice
clarence
thomas
this
case
comes
to
us
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
arizona
court
of
appeals.
respondent
is
a
construction
company
incorporated
under
the
laws
of
blackfeet
tribe
of
montana.
bureau
of
indian
affairs
contracted
with
respondent
to
perform
work
on
several
indian
reservation
roads
in
arizona.
because
none
of
the
work
occurred
on
it’s
own
reservation,
respondent
is
treated
as
a
non-indian
private
company
for
purposes
of
this
case.
arizona
imposes
a
tax
on
the
gross
receipts
of
the
companies
doing
business
in
that
state.
respondent
failed
to
pay
this
tax
on
the
proceeds
from
its
contract
with
the
bureau.
arizona
issued
a
tax
deficiency
assessment
and
respondent
protested,
arguing
that
the
federal
law
preempted
arizona’s
tax
and
hence
it
owed
no
taxes
to
arizona.
the
arizona
tax
court
rejected
the
protest,
but
the
arizona
court
of
appeals
reversed.
employing
a
test
which
balanced
the
federal,
state
and
tribal
interest
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
a
congressional
intent
to
preempt
arizona’s
tax
could
be
inferred
from
the
federal
laws
regulating
the
welfare
of
indian
tribes.
the
arizona’s
supreme
court
denied
a
petition
for
review.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
we
reverse.
a
state
generally
may
impose
a
nondiscriminatory
tax
on
a
private
company’s
proceeds
from
its
contracts
with
the
federal
government.
congress
may
displace
its
authority
by
expressly
exempting
the
contracts
from
such
taxation.
in
this
case
congress
has
not
expressly
exempted
respondent’s
contract
from
arizona’s
gross
receipt
tax.
and
the
incidence
of
that
tax
falls
on
respondent
not
the
united
states.
the
court
of
appeals
was
mistaken
in
its
efforts
to
balance
the
federal,
state
and
tribal
interest
while
that
balancing
test
has
been
applied
to
state
taxation
of
on
reservation
transactions
between
tribes
and
private
parties.
it
does
not
apply
to
taxation
of
transactions
between
federal
government
and
its
private
contractors
even
when
those
transactions
happen
to
take
place
on
indian
reservations.
the
opinion
of
the
court
is
unanimous.
