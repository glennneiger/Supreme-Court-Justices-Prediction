unknown
speaker
let
me
ask
you
a
question.
there's
something,
legislation,
called
the
self-determination
act
under
which,
if
i
understand
it
correctly,
an
indian
tribe
could
opt
to
accept
federal
money
to
build
roads
and
projects
like
this
using
that
money
but
itself
administering
the
program.
now,
if
the
tribe
had
done
so
and
had
awarded
the
contract
in
question
here,
could...
could
the
state
have
been
able
to
impose
the
tax
then,
do
you
think?
unknown
speaker
so,
it
was
open
to
the
tribe
to
protect
itself
had
it
wanted
to
do
so--
unknown
speaker
--and
its...
and
its
contractors.
unknown
speaker
thank
you.
unknown
speaker
the...
the
tax
here
amounts
to
quite
a
bit
of
money
all
told,
doesn't
it?
how
much
is
at
stake?
unknown
speaker
and
yet,
in
fact,
the
state
has
provided
very
little
in
the
nature
of
services,
i
guess,
in
connection
with
this
contractor.
unknown
speaker
well,
but
i
thought
that
we
had
made
a
special
inquiry
into
the
extent
the
state
has
provided
services
when
indian
sovereignty
is
at
stake,
as
opposed
to
whether
or
not
the
state
can
just
tax
a
federal
contractor
without
added
complication
of
an
indian
reservation.
unknown
speaker
in
other
words,
the
cotton
petroleum
case
requires
us
to
make
this
sort
of
inquiry.
unknown
speaker
and...
and
you
would
say
the
cotton
petroleum
inquiry
then
is...
is
not
necessary
when
there's
a
federal
contractor
involved?
unknown
speaker
what
about
the
argument
that
it
will
reduce
the
total
amount
available
for
road
building
if
some
money
has
to
be
spent
in
paying
state
taxes,
that
that
money
that
could
be
spared
would
otherwise
be
available
to
build
more
roads
inside
the
reservation?
unknown
speaker
are
these
contracts
subject
to
federal
wage
laws?
unknown
speaker
so,
there
may
be
no
economic
impact
at
all
if
indeed
the
wages
are...
happen
to
be
set
according
to
what
the
rest
of
the
industry
is
doing
in
that
area
no
matter...
and
the
rest
of
the...
and
the
rest
of
the
industry
is
paying
taxes
if
the
market
is
operating
properly
anyway.
this
contract
wouldn't
necessarily
be
reduced
by
the
amount
of
the
tax.
unknown
speaker
what
about
the
argument
that
sovereignty
is
implicated
because
you're
steering...
the
state
by
taxing
the
contractor,
when
the
contract
is
with
the
united
states,
is
steering
the
tribe's
decision
not
to
do
the...
be
the
contracting
party
itself?
unknown
speaker
very
well,
mr.
irvine.
ms.
brinkmann,
we'll
hear
from
you.
unknown
speaker
ms.
brinkmann,
what
if
the
tribe
had
elected
under
the
self-determination
act
to
take
the
money
and...
and
award
the
contracts?
unknown
speaker
may
i
just
ask
something
out
of
curiosity?
i'm
not
familiar
with
the
statute
that
justice
o'connor
cited.
does
that
statute
provide
for
waiver
of
tribal
sovereign
immunity?
unknown
speaker
so
that
a
contractor
conceivably
might
say,
well,
i
don't
want
to
do
business
with
you
because
i
might
not
be
able
to
collect.
unknown
speaker
how
do
we
describe
the
state's
interest
in
taxing?
simply
because
the
reservation
is
within
the
sovereign
borders
of
the
state?
unknown
speaker
and--
--well,
ms.
brinkmann,
you
say
that
it
would
have
interest
in
taxing
that
land.
actually
they're
taxing
a
transaction--
unknown
speaker
--that
took
place
on
the
land.
unknown
speaker
and
is
this
against
the
background
of
the
fact
that
the
state
always
provides
certain
services
or,
again,
is
it
just
this
geographic
location
within
the
sovereign
borders
of
the
state?
unknown
speaker
well,
certainly
it
wouldn't
be
open
to
me,
say,
if
i
live
in
arlington,
virginia,
to
refuse
to
pay
my
property
tax
because
they're
not
fixing
a
pothole
in
my
road,
would
it?
unknown
speaker
thank
you,
ms.
brinkmann.
mr.
smith,
we'll
hear
from
you.
unknown
speaker
mr.
smith,
i...
i
suppose
that
the
government
is
speaking
here
for...
for
the
bia,
don't
you
think?
unknown
speaker
what
was
mr.
ward's
position
in
the
bureau
of
indian
affairs?
unknown
speaker
and
he
himself
is
a
federal
employee,
i
take
it.
unknown
speaker
of
the
bureau
of
indian
affairs?
unknown
speaker
well,
certainly
in
white
mountain
apache
tribe,
it
was
the
tribe
that
entered
into
the
contract
with
the
logging
company,
was
it
not?
unknown
speaker
and
that
isn't
the
case
here.
this
comes
much
closer
to
the
new
mexico
case,
does
it
not?
unknown
speaker
well,
the
tribe
could
have
opted
under
the
act
to
ask
for
the
money
and
do
its
own
contracting.
unknown
speaker
but
unlike
those
two
cases,
it's
a
u.s.
contractor
contract,
and
is
there
any
precedent,
other
than
this
arizona
appeals
court,
that
says
that
the
state
can
tax
when
the
contract
is
between
the
united
states
and
the
contractor
as
distinguished
from
the
two
cases
on
which
you
rely
where
the
contract
was
with
the
tribe
itself?
unknown
speaker
well,
why...
why
couldn't
one
take
the
positions...
your
big
point
is
that
there
are
three
sovereigns
in
this
picture...
that
the
tribe,
whenever
it
chooses
to
act
as
sovereign,
that
is,
make
the
contract
itself,
its
tribal
sovereignty
is
respected,
but
when
it
chooses
to
let
the
united
states
act
as
kind
of
patriarch
for
it,
then
it
isn't
exercising
its
sovereign
capacity?
it's
more
in
the
position
of...
of
the
ward
of
the
united
states
who
is
acting
for
its
benefit.
unknown
speaker
well,
what
if
the
indian
tribe
were
to
lease
property
to
a
non-indian
business
entity?
the
business
entity
sets
up
operation
and
does
business
on
the
reservation
on
the...
from
the
leased
premises
with
non-indians.
the
state
wants
to
tax.
you
could
make
the
same
argument,
that
to
allow
the
state
to
tax
would
interfere
with
tribal
sovereignty.
unknown
speaker
do
you
say
there
the
state
is
free
to
impose
its
taxes?
unknown
speaker
and
it
makes
it
very
difficult
to
apply
any
general
principle.
it's
a
case-by-case
analysis
every
time
so
that
people
really
don't
know
what
the
outcome
is
going
to
be
until
perhaps
it
gets
to
this
court.
unknown
speaker
but
it's
certainly
more
difficult
than
the
united
states
v.
new
mexico
doctrine.
i
mean,
i
don't
think
we've
had
a
case
on
state
taxation
of
federal
entities
since
our
decision
in
united
states
against
new
mexico,
which
is
a
signal
that
it's
a
readily
understood
and
applicable
doctrine
in
the
lower
courts.
unknown
speaker
well,
certainly
the
federal
government
here
is
saying
it
does
take
into
consideration
the
federal
interest.
unknown
speaker
well,
the
idea
that
we
should
be
concerned
about
a
bia
employee
when
the
bia
itself
isn't
concerned
strikes
me
as...
as...
as
rather
unusual,
to
say
the
least.
unknown
speaker
what
do
we
do
with...
with
contractors
with
the
federal
government
itself?
we
don't
apply
this
case-by-case
weighing
as
to...
to
what
extent
the...
the
state's
imposition
of
a
tax
upon
this
contract
with
the
federal
government
will
affect
the
sovereignty
interests
of
the
federal
government,
blah,
blah,
blah.
i
mean,
you
know,
we...
there
would
be
no
end
to
litigation
if
we
did
that.
we
simply
have
a
flat
rule.
you
can
do
it.
unknown
speaker
and
why
should
we
have
a
different
rule
for
the
indian
tribes?
unknown
speaker
but
you
can't
demand
more
of
a
person
than
that
he
treats
someone
as
well
as
he
would
treat
himself,
and
if
the
federal
government
doesn't...
doesn't
deem
it
a...
too
much
of
an
imposition
upon
its
own
sovereignty
to
have...
to
have
its
contracts
taxed
by
the
states,
why
should
it
deem
it
an
excessive
imposition
upon
the
tribes'
sovereignty
to
have
their
contracts
taxed
by
the
states?
unknown
speaker
well,
sure,
but
any
tax
is...
is
going
to
affect
how
the
tribe
decides
to
do
business
to
some
degree.
and...
and
we're
supposed
to
sit
here
and
decide
whether
the
degree
is
too
much
contract
by
contract?
you'd
have
to
do
it
contract
by
contract,
wouldn't
you?
unknown
speaker
well,
if
it's
clear
that
the
taxes
can
be
imposed,
then
in
the
federal
budgeting
and
appropriation
process,
that
amount
can
be
taken
into
consideration.
i
think
it's
very
helpful
to
have
a
clear
rule
and
not
monkey
around
with
some
case-by-case
analysis,
and
certainly
the
budgeting
and
appropriation
processes
can
take
into
account
all
the
expenditures
that
will
be
required
and
the
costs,
including
applicable
state
taxes.
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask,
mr.
smith?
your
rule
isn't
limited
to
road
building,
is
it,
the
rule
you
advocate?
unknown
speaker
no
matter
what...
if
they
build
houses
or
ski
resorts
or
casinos,
anybody
contracting
with
the
tribe
would
have
a
tax
exemption.
unknown
speaker
the
federal
government.
with
the
federal
government
doing
anything
for
the
tribe.
of
course,
a
fortiori,
if
it's
a
contract
directly
with
the
tribe,
of
course,
it
would
be
totally
exempt
under
your
view.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
mr.
smith,
i
gather
that...
you
said
the
contractor,
but
at
least
according
to
the
petitioner's
brief,
the...
there
are
a
number
of
contracts
all
over
the
state
with
different...
different
tribes.
is
that
correct?
unknown
speaker
and
so,
your
client
did
work
not
just
on
the
navajo
reservation
but
on
a
number
of
other
indian
properties,
if
one
may
call
it
that,
in
the
state.
unknown
speaker
thank
you,
mr.
smith.
mr.
irvine,
you
have
7
minutes
remaining.
unknown
speaker
the
honorable
court
is
now
adjourned
until
tomorrow
at
ten
o'clock.
