mr.
bruce
c.
smith
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
1980,
the
state
of
arizona
came
to
this
court
and
admitted
that
it
wanted
to
tax
a
nonmember
use
of
bia
roads,
and
this
court
in
white
mountain
v.
bracker
told
the
state
of
arizona,
you
cannot
tax
when
a
nonmember
uses
those
same
bia
roads.
now
the
state
is
here
to
say
when
a
nonmember
is
building
those
same
bia
roads,
we
are
entitled
to
tax
it.
under
the
implied
preemption
analysis
for
indian
cases,
this
court
should
affirm
the
decision
of
the
arizona
court
of
appeals
and
hold
that
this
tax
is
preempted.
the
central
issue
in
this
case
is,
i
believe,
what
test
should
this
court
apply.
should
it
apply
the
united
states
v.
new
mexico
rule,
or
should
it
apply
indian
preemption
analysis?
there
are
several
reasons
why
united
states
v.
new
mexico
simply
does
not
work
here.
united
states
v.
new
mexico
is
a
decision
of
this
court
based
on
the
clash
of
only
two
sovereigns,
that
is,
state
authority
and
federal
authority,
and
whether
states
can
tax
contractors
with
the
federal
government.
that
two-sovereign
dispute
is
not
at
issue
when
you
are
dealing
with
indian
tribes.
this
court
has
recognized
on
a
number
of
occasions
that
indian
tribes
and
their
relationship
to
states
and
the
federal
government
is
a
unique
one
in
our
constitutional
system.
and
the
other
thing
that
is
important
to
consider
is
that
the
agency
here
that
is
dealing
with
these
indian
tribes
is
the
bia.
it's
not
the
department
of
energy
or
the
old
atomic
energy
commission
in
united
states
v.
new
mexico.
we
are
dealing
here
with
the
bureau
of
indian
affairs,
an
agency
whose
sole
obligation
is
to
satisfy
a
trust
obligation
that
it
has
toward
indian
tribes.
the
other
important
consideration
here
that
is
not
present
in
united
states
v.
new
mexico
analysis--
mr.
bruce
c.
smith
--i
would
submit,
your
honor,
that
the
government
is
speaking
on
behalf
of
the
bia
at
the
highest
levels,
but
i
think
if
you
carefully
read
the
government's
brief
and
you
look
at
the
record
in
this
case,
most
notably
the
testimony
of
mr.
ward
that
is
in
the
joint
appendix
and
the
full
transcript
that
is
an
appendix
to
our
appellate
brief,
you'll
see
that
there
are
differences
between
what
the
government
says
and
what
mr.
ward
said
in
his
testimony.
mr.
ward
recognized
that
one
of
my
obligations
is
to
do
the
most
that
we
can
on
behalf
of
these
tribes.
the
government
says,
we...
there...
excuse
me...
there
is
no
interest
that
the
tribes
have
once
we
have
them
contracted.
that
is
simply
not
true
in
this
case.
mr.
bruce
c.
smith
mr.
ward
was
the
contracting
officer
for
all
of
the
navajo
contracts
that
are
at
issue
in
this
case.
mr.
ward
put
the
contracts
out
for
bid.
he
reviewed
the
contracts.
he
went
to
the
federal
government
and
got
a
comparison
bid
to
make
sure
that
the
bids
were
in
line,
and
he
ultimately
awarded
the
contracts.
the
record
shows
that
he
signed
all
of
these
contracts.
mr.
bruce
c.
smith
he
himself
is
a
federal
employee.
mr.--
mr.
bruce
c.
smith
--yes,
that's
true.
and
now,
the
government's
position
here
is,
well,
this
is
not
going
to
interfere
in
tribal
sovereignty.
i
believe
that
it
will
interfere
in
tribal
sovereignty
because
if
this
court
upholds
arizona's
taxes,
what
it's
going
to
do
is
it's
going
to
send
a
message
maybe
not
to
the
people
down
the
street
who
are
making
broad
policy
statements,
but
it
is
going
to
interfere
with
the
way
mr.
ward
will
do
his
job
tomorrow
and
the
way
in
which
the
navajos,
the
gila
river
reservations,
and
the
other
tribes
interact
with
mr.
ward.
mr.
ward
will
now
have
to
go
to
these
tribes
and
say,
if
you
want
a
hundred
percent
of
your
federal
dollars
under
these
contracts,
you
should
do
the
contracts
yourself,
but
if
you
can
get
by
with
95
percent
of
the
budget
for
your
contracts,
then
we
can
do
that.
that
is
fulfilling
the
trust
obligation,
and...
and
under
the
contracts
that
were
at
issue
in
this
case,
that
was
his
regulatory
obligation,
to
tell
the
tribes
the
financial
impacts
of
these
tribal
self-determination
decisions.
this
court
has
repeatedly
said--
mr.
bruce
c.
smith
--yes,
it
was,
your
honor.
mr.
bruce
c.
smith
i
don't
believe
that
it
comes
closer
to
the
new
mexico
case,
justice
o'connor,
for
this
reason.
congress
has
given
to
tribes
the
right
to
make
these
what
are
called
638
decisions,
the
self-determination
contract
decision.
congress
has
said,
when
you
decide
to
contract
or
when
you
decide
not
to
contract,
those
are
both
equal
self-determination
decisions.
you
are...
we
are
not
going
to--
mr.
bruce
c.
smith
--yes,
it
could
have,
your
honor.
but
you
must
recognize
the
realities
of
our
indian
tribes
and
their
particular
situations.
some
tribes
like
the
navajo
nation
may
have
expertise
in
an
area,
for
example,
road
construction,
and
they
may
have
the
ability
to
contract.
but
the
policy
of
congress
here
is
we're
not
going
to
prejudice
you
if
there's
a
decision
about
perhaps
building
a...
a
jail
for
the
tribe
or
building
a
clinic
if
you
don't
have
the
expertise
in
that
area.
you
should
get
the
same
amount
of
money.
we're
not
going
to
interfere,
and
congress
has
specifically
told
the
government
in
1994
when
it
amended
the
tribal
self-determination
act,
we
don't
want
the
bia
to
interfere
when
indian
tribes
make
these
decisions.
now,
if
we
have
a
situation
where
congress
is
responding
to
indian
tribes
about
interference
with
tribal
self-determination
decisions,
congress
has
responded,
clarified
its
intent,
has
mandated
that
the
bia
promulgate
self-determination
act
regulations,
and
those
regulations
say,
we
are
not
going
to
interfere
with
tribal
sovereignty,
then
you
have
a
situation
where
the
decision
process
itself,
whether
or
not
to
contract,
is
heavily
regulated
by
statutes
and
regulations.
you
have
that
preemptive
effect.
you
have
those...
you
have
the
situation
like
ramah
navajo
and
the
bracker
case
where
the
congressional
policies
are
preempted
by
state
law.
and
like
the
ramah
navajo
case
and
like
the
bracker
decision,
we
have
a
case
here
in
which
arizona
does
not
have
any
interest
in
the
construction
activity
at
issue.
mr.
bruce
c.
smith
no,
justice
ginsburg.
i
am
not
aware
of
any
such
case.
but
what
i
am
aware
of
is
prior
decisions
of
this
court
like
in
the
colville
case
where
it
addressed
a...
an
argument
of
tribal
self-determination
and
the
court
applied
the
same
preemption
balancing
test
to
determine
whether
the
state
tax
was
preempted
by
federal
law.
now,
in
the
colville
case,
the
court
applied
that
balancing
test
and
upheld
the
state
tax
because
what
was
at
issue
there
was
they...
as
the
court
characterized
it,
they're
simply
marketing
a
tax
exemption
and
making
cheaper
cigarettes
available
to
non-indians.
that's
not--
mr.
bruce
c.
smith
--if
we
were
dealing
with
a
clean
slate
and
simply
as
a
matter
of
federal
common
law,
i
might
agree
with
you,
justice
ginburg...
ginsburg,
but
what
we
have
here
is
the
court
looks
to
congress
to
tell
it
what
is...
how
congress
is
exercising
its
plenary
authority.
and
in
this
instance,
congress
has
told
the
united
states
that
self-determination
decisions
whether
or
not
to
contract
are
both
equal
self-determination
decisions.
so,
you
can't
simply
presume
that
it's
not
exercising
its
sovereign
decision
making
process.
one
of
the
issues
that
has
come
up
in
this
case
is
whether
there's
going
to
be
any
interference
with
the
tribal
decision
making
process,
and
it
will
have
a
direct
impact
on
that
decision
making
process.
mr.
bruce
c.
smith
the...
those
kinds
of
commercial
relationships,
justice
o'connor,
have
been
dealt
with
by
the
court
in
the
past.
if
you
look
at
the
cases
that
were
cited
by
one
of
the
amici,
those
kinds
of
commercial
relationships--
mr.
bruce
c.
smith
--i
think
that
what
the
court
should
do
is
apply
its
implied
preemption
analysis,
look
at
the
situation,
and
see
whether
there's
an
overriding
federal
and
tribal
interest
that
should
preempt
this
kind
of
tax.
the
beauty
of
this
court's
implied
preemption
analysis
is
that
it
takes
into
consideration
the
interests
of
all
three
parties
who
are
being
affected
by--
mr.
bruce
c.
smith
--this
court
in
many
factual
situations
does
not
apply
a
bright
line
rule.
this
court
in
free
speech
cases,
religion
cases,
and
discrimination
cases
applies
tests.
it
applies
factors.
and
if
you
look
at
state
taxation
of
interstate
cases
or
state
taxation
of
foreign
commerce
clause
cases,
this
court
still
applies
factors,
determines
whether
those
factors
are
satisfied,
and
then
determines
whether
the
state
nondiscriminatory
tax
will
be
upheld.
i
submit
that
the
federal
preemption
analysis
that
this
court
has
adopted,
while
it
does
require
case-by-case
analysis,
is
not
a
difficult
and
is
not
an
unduly
burdensome
test.
mr.
bruce
c.
smith
i
agree,
your
honor.
it
is
a
readily
understood
test.
however,
that
test
does
not
take
into
consideration
the
federal
and
tribal
interests
that
are
at
issue
in
cases
like
this.
mr.
bruce
c.
smith
i
would
disagree
with...
with
the
united
states'
position
on
whether
it's
going
to
interfere
with
their
relationships
with
indian
tribes.
i
think
when
you
get
down
to
the
mr.
wards
of
this
world
in
the
bia,
it
is
going
to
have
a
direct
and
it
is
going
to
have
a
substantial
impact
on
the
way
in
which
they
are
interacting
with
these
indian
tribes.
the
court
must
keep--
mr.
bruce
c.
smith
--this
court
in
many
of
its
criminal
procedure
cases
takes
into
consideration
what
the
effect
of
its
rulings
will
be
for
the
police
officers
on
the
street.
will
this
rule
be
difficult
to
apply?
how
easy
will
this
rule
be
to
apply?
that
is
the
same
consideration
that
the
court
should
take
into
consideration
for
mr.
ward
because
it
is
not
the
solicitor
general's
office
that
on
a
day-to-day
basis
carries
into
effect
the
united
states'
trust
responsibilities
to
this
nation's
indian
tribes.
mr.
bruce
c.
smith
i
agree
but--
mr.
bruce
c.
smith
--the
reason
why
we
have
a
different
rule
and
the
court
should
adopt
a
different
rule
for
indian
tribes
is
because
of
that
unique
trust
relationship
because
in
these
situations
the
government
doesn't
deal
with
indian
tribes
as
a
mere
recipient
of
federal
money.
it
deals
with
them
on
a
government-to-government
basis.
mr.
bruce
c.
smith
because
congress
has
said
that
self-determination
decisions
are
equal
expressions,
and
what
this
does
is
it
adds
an
additional
factor
into
the
tribal
calculus
of
whether
or
not
to
make
a
self-determination
decision.
mr.
bruce
c.
smith
in
some
situations,
justice
scalia,
you
may
have
to
do
that,
but
when
you...
i
think
when
you
look
at
the
broader
issues
that
are
involved
here,
i
think
that
decisions
by
this
court
or
the
lower
courts
can
help
clarify
the
issue.
i
think
that
decisions
by
the
ninth
circuit
have
clarified
sales
tax
issues
in
arizona
law.
i
think
that
decisions
by
this
court
have
clarified
the...
the
smoke
shop
line
of
cases.
however,
in
the
contracting
situation,
if
this
court
adopts
our
rule,
it
will
send
a
message
and
it
will
provide
clarity
to
this
situation.
we
are
talking
about
something
that
is
crystal
clear.
it's
the
tax.
it's
the
percentage
of
tax.
and
the
court,
probably
for
the
first
time,
has
before
it
an
actual
record
of
the...
of
the
impact
of
this
tax.
mr.
ward
provided
that
testimony,
and
he
said
that
a
5
percent
tax
will
mean
a
5
percent
reduction
in
the
amount
of
roads
that
are
built.
that
is
what
is
a
very,
very
important
and
a
very,
very
crucial
decision
for
this
court
to
consider.
the
tax
itself
affects
tribal
procurement
processes.
how
much
money
are
we
going
to
have?
if
we
decide
after
the
planning
stage
to
determine
the
scope
of
the
road
contract,
well,
what's
going
to
be
left?
is
the...
is
the
federal
government
going
to
budget
enough
money
for
this
project?
we've
designed
it,
and
in
many
situations
tribes
have
the
right
to
take
money
from
the
government
and
plan
their
own
roads.
will
there
be
enough
money
to
build
the
road
that
we
have
planned?
how
much
is
going
to
be
there?
that
is
an
important--
mr.
bruce
c.
smith
--if
the
court
were
to
adopt
that
standard
and
send
the
message
to
congress,
i
do
not
believe
that
it
will
still
in...
in
the
future
have
the
effect
that...
that
you
desire,
justice
o'connor,
because
what
is
going
to
happen
under
the
transportation
equity
act
for
the
21st
century
is
that
congress
is
going
to
authorize
money
to
indian
tribes
on
a
tribe-by-tribe
basis.
those
indian
tribes
are
then
going
to
be
left
with
the
position
of
knowing
what
money
has
been
budgeted
for
them.
they're
going
to
be
in
the
position
of,
as
in
this
case,
setting
the
priorities,
working
on
the
planning
with
the
bia,
and
then
they
have
to
decide
whether
or
not
to
enter
into
the
self-determination
act
decision.
it's
much
like
the
decision
that
state
legislatures
and
congress
make
every
year
when
they
do
tax
projections.
how
much
money
are
we
going
to
have
in
our
budget
for
us
this
year?
what
kind
of
projects--
mr.
bruce
c.
smith
--no.
mr.
bruce
c.
smith
a
contract
with
the
tribe,
justice
stevens?
mr.
bruce
c.
smith
yes.
mr.
bruce
c.
smith
i
think
in
those
situations,
for
example,
looking
at...
at
gaming
casinos,
you'd
have
to
look
at
the
federal,
state,
and
tribal
interests
involved.
that's
a
balancing
test
that...
that
other
folks
have
engaged
in
and
we
know
how
to
apply
it.
i
believe
that
it's
very
simple.
you
simply
look
at
the
state
involvement
with
the
on-reservation
activity.
you
look
at
the
federal
and
tribal
interests
that
are
involved
and
you
do
the
balancing
test
and
you
make
the
decision
as
to
where
it
comes
out.
now,
in
some
of
the
cases
that
have
been
cited
in
the
briefs
like
the
gila
river
case,
you
had
a
situation
in
which
the
state
or
state
agencies
were
actively
involved
in
the
on...
on-reservation
activity.
policemen
were
provided
for
certain
events.
in
that
case,
the
court
was
able
to
determine
this
is
how
the
balancing
test
comes
out.
going
back
to
the
contracting
situation,
you
would
look
at
situations
involving
perhaps
under
the
indian
health
service
a
clinic
or
a
medical
facility
and
the
other
applicable
federal
statutes
to
determine
what
kind
of...
of
balancing
and
how
that
test
comes
out.
the
petitioners
and
the
united
states
have
argued
that,
you
know,
we...
we
don't
have
to
necessarily
consider
each
and
every
factor.
and
this
is
just
one
factor
and
it's
almost
like
a
slippery
slope
here.
but
what
is
important
to
consider
is
this
court's
decisions
in
the
new
mexico
v.
mescalero
apache
tribe
and
in
the
white
mountain/bracker
case
itself.
in
both
of
those
decisions,
this
court
said,
we
need
to
consider
whether
this
tax
would
affect
the
full
objectives
of
the
federal
legislation.
similarly
in
the
new
mexico/mescalero
apache
case,
the
court
said,
how
is
this
going
to
affect
the
legislation?
and
that's
what
we
have
here.
we
have
a
tax.
it's
a
set
percentage
of
a
tax.
and
the
court
has
to
ask
itself,
is
this
going
to
interfere
with
congress'
stated
objective,
interfering
with
decisions
on
whether
or
not
to
enter
into
these
self-determination
act
decisions?
it
clearly
will.
like
in
bracker
where
the
court
condemned
the
imposition
of
the
tax,
even
though
it
was
only
5,000
or
6,000
dollars
in
annual
taxes,
this
court
said
that
that
tax
will
add
an
additional
factor
for
the
parties
to
consider,
and
that
is
sufficient
for
us
to
find
that
the
tax
is
preempted.
this
road
construction
contract
is
no
different
than
the
construction
contract
at
issue
in
the
white
mountain/bracker
case.
we
believe
that
that
case
is
on
all
fours
with
this
case
but
for
the
issue
of
whether
or
not
the
court
should
apply
preemption
analysis
to
indian
roads.
mr.
bruce
c.
smith
yes,
your
honor,
that
is
correct.
what
happened
in
this
situation
is
mr.
ward...
he
is
a
navajo
representative
of
the
bia.
given
the
size
of
the
navajo
tribe,
they
have
their
own
special
bia
office.
there's
also
evidence
in
the
record
that's
alluded
to
regarding
the
phoenix
office.
that
is
another
bia
office
and
they
administer
federal
programs
and
interact
with
federal
tribes
in
the
phoenix
office.
there
are
a
number
of
bia
offices
and
they
deal
with
the
tribes
in
their
jurisdiction.
mr.
bruce
c.
smith
that's
correct,
your
honor.
blaze
built
roads
on
the
navajo
reservation.
it
built
roads
on
the
hopi
reservation,
the
papago...
now
it's
called
the
tohono
o'odham...
reservation,
the
gila
reservation,
and
the
colorado
river
indian
reservation.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
thank
you.
