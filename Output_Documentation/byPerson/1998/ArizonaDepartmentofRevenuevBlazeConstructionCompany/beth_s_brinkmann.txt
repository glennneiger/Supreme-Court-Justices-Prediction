ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
we
believe
that
under
united
states
v.
new
mexico,
respondent
blaze
as
the
federal
contractor
is
subject
to
the
nondiscriminatory
state
tax
at
issue
here
because
congress
has
not
expressly
acted
to
provide
otherwise.
the
fact
that
the
contracts
involved
building
and
maintenance
of
roads
on
indian
reservations
should
not
alter
that
analysis.
the
blaze
company's
invocation
of
the
indian
preemption
doctrine
is
misplaced.
that
doctrine
has
been
applied
by
this
court
in
cases
where
nontribal
members
engage
in
direct
commercial
dealings
with
indian
tribes
or
members
of
tribes.
but
here,
the
nontribal
members
engaged
in
direct
dealings
with
a
federal
agency.
thus,
the
three
primary
concerns
that
trigger
application
of
the
indian
preemption
doctrine
are
not
present.
first,
state
taxes
on
federal
contractors
will
not
unduly
interfere
with
tribal
sovereignty
because
the
united
states
is
the
contracting
party,
not
the
tribe.
the
tribe's
involvement
in
the
making
and
performance
of
the
contract
is
far
less
significant
than
if
the
tribe
was
a
party
to
the
contract.
second,
state
taxes
on
federal
contractors
have
only
an
uncertain
and
indirect
effect
on
a
tribe's
economic
self-sufficiency
because
that
effect
depends
on
the
united
states'
response
to
the
state
tax.
the
tribal
treasury
is
not
directly
involved.
the
united
states
may
choose
not
to
pass
the
state
tax
on
to
the
tribal
entity.
the
united
states
may
increase
appropriations,
or
the
united
states
may
change
the
allocation
of
the
funds.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
we
believe
that
the
indian
preemption
doctrine
then
would
be
applied,
and
there
would
be
a
balancing
analysis
under
that
because
in
that
situation,
your
honor,
these
concerns
about
direct
relations
with
the
tribe,
tribal
sovereignty,
and
economic
self-sufficiency
of
the
tribe
would
be
at
issue
because
the
tribe
would
be
a
party
to
the
contract.
with
regard
to
the
third
major
reason
we
think
that
the
state
taxes
on
federal
contracts
don't
call
for
the
application
of
that
doctrine,
though,
is
because
the
core
concerns
about
the
regulation
of
direct
relations
with
indians
is
not
present
because
the
tribe
is
not
a...
a
member
to
the
contract.
those
kinds
of
federal
concerns
are
found
in
the
indian
commerce
clause,
the
federal
government's
ability
to
regulate
commerce
directly
with
indian
tribes,
and
in
statutes
such
as
the
indian
trader
statutes
and
the
self-determination
act
statute,
which
justice
o'connor
asked
about.
the
interests
underlying
those
statutes
would
come
into
play
if
the
indian
tribe
were
a
direct
party
to
the
contract.
also,
regarding
the
economic
self-sufficiency,
as
united
states
v.
new
mexico
makes
clear,
in
a
case
where
the
united
states
is
the
contracting
party,
the
united
states
has
the
authority
to
alter
the
imposition
of
that
state
tax
by
legislation.
here,
of
course,
the
tribe
would
not
have
that
authority
if
they
were
the
direct
party
to
the
contract.
and
as
the
court
made
clear
in
the
montana
v.
crow
case
and
the
cotton
petroleum
case,
the
indian
preemption
doctrine
in
those
situations
protects
against
extraordinarily
high
taxes,
protects
the
tribe.
respondent,
nonetheless,
invokes
the
indian
preemption
doctrine
based
on
purported
interference
with
federal
interests,
particularly
the
self-determination
act,
which
we
were
just
discussing.
as
we
discussed,
that
statute
authorizes
tribes
to
make
the
choice
whether
to
take
over
federal
government
projects,
enter
into
their
own
relationships
with
contractors.
but
in
response
to
your
question,
justice
ginsburg,
to
my
co-counsel,
we
believe
there's
nothing
in
that
statute
that
suggests
that
it
was
intended
to
preempt
all
aspects
of
a
state
law
that
could
somehow
indirectly
affect
a
tribe's
decision
whether
to
enter
into
a
self-determination
act
contract.
rather,
that
statute
reinforces
the
fact
that
there
is
a
distinction
between
a
contract
with
the
federal
government
and
a
contract
with
a
tribe,
reinforcing
the
fact
that
when
there's
a
tribal
contract
and
the
contract
is
directly
with
the
tribe,
questions
of
tribal
sovereignty
and
self-determination
are
at
issue.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
no,
it
does
not,
your
honor.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
that
may
be,
your
honor.
there
were
some
provisions
on...
in
regulations
also
concerning
requirements
for
liability
insurance,
for
example,
in
some
instances.
also
though,
you
would
have
to
take
into
other
concerns
about
whether
or
not
the
contractor
would
engage
in
a
relationship
with
the
tribe
and
that
way
perhaps
the
tax
instance
that's
at
issue
here
would
make
a
significant
difference
in--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--yes,
your
honor.
the
court
has
made
clear
that
that
land
is
within
the
state
and
that
the
state
would
still
have
interest
in
taxing
the
land
within
its
geographic
boundaries,
and
we
think
under
united
states
v.
new
mexico
as
a
federal
contractor,
the
court
has
made
clear
that
there
is
no
bar
to
that
tax
unless
congress
provides
otherwise
expressly.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
yes.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
i'm
sorry.
i
misspoke.
certainly,
your
honor,
it's
that
transaction
privilege
tax.
it's
that
relationship,
that
contract
between
the
contractor
and
the
united
states.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
i
think
it's
both,
your
honor.
i
mean,
i
think
that
the
idea
that
it's
within
the
geographic
boundaries
of
the
state
calls
into
fact
the
question
that
a
state
provides
services
to
the
entire
geographic
entity.
i
think
it's
what
the
court
talked
about
in
cotton
petroleum,
the
general
services
that
are...
anyone
is
entitled
to
in
an
organized
community.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
no,
your
honor.
it
certainly
would
not.
if
there's
nothing
further,
your
honor,
we
believe
that
the
decision
of
the
arizona
court
of
appeals
should
be
reversed.
thank
you.
