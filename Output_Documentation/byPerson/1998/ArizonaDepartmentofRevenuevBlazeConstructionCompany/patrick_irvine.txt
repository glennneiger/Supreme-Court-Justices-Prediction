mr.
patrick
irvine
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
court
should
adopt
a
categorical
bright
line
rule
that
nontribal
members
who
work
as
federal
contractors
on
indian
reservations
are
subject
to
nondiscriminatory
state
taxes
unless
congress
expressly
provides
otherwise.
this
rule
will
clarify
existing
law,
recognize
a
uniform
rule
that
applies
throughout
the
country,
and
provide
certainty
and
predictability
to
contractors,
the
federal
government,
and
to
states.
this
rule
is
consistent
with
this
court's
precedents
regarding
federal
contractors
and
will
not
require
the
court
to
rule...
overrule
any
of
its
decisions
concerning
taxation
of
persons
doing
business
with
indian
tribes
or
tribal
members.
this
is
the
rule
that
the
united
states
itself
argues
here
should
apply.
if--
mr.
patrick
irvine
--no,
your
honor.
under
the
authority
of
the
ramah
navajo
school
board
case,
if
a
contractor...
a
nontribal
member
contractor
deals
directly
with
a
tribal
entity,
then
there
is
no
state
tax.
mr.
patrick
irvine
that's
correct,
your
honor.
none
of
the--
mr.
patrick
irvine
--none
of
the
contracts
at
issue
were...
were
taken
over
by
tribes
pursuant
to
self-determination,
but
each
and
every
one
of
them
could
have
been.
mr.
patrick
irvine
in
fact,
if
congress
decides
that
a
different
rule,
a
different
preemption
rule,
should
apply,
it
can
certainly
enact
one.
it
has
the
authority
to
provide
that
there
is
no
state
tax
in
almost
any
circumstance
and
certainly
in...
in
circumstances
dealing
with
indian
reservations.
mr.
patrick
irvine
the
assessment,
including
interest,
was
approximately
1.2
million
dollars.
the
tax,
as
a
percentage
of
the
gross
receipts
for
every
contract,
is
3.5
percent
of
the
gross
receipts.
mr.
patrick
irvine
we
don't
argue
that
there
are
any
direct
services
directly
to
these
contracts
or
the
particular
geographic
location.
as
we
cite
in
the
brief,
the
state
has
not
ignored
these
reservations
and
does
provide
numerous
general
services
to
the
reservations
and,
indeed,
to
blaze
both
on
and
off
the
reservation.
we
have
not
argued
that
there
have
to
be
direct
services.
and
that's
consistent
with
the
rule
that
applies
to
any
federal
contractor.
almost
any
federal
contract,
whether
it
be
on
a
military
base
or
in
a
national
forest,
may
involve
little
in
the
way
of
state
services,
and
the
state
may
have
very
little
authority
to
regulate
the
contract.
but
congress--
mr.
patrick
irvine
--that's
correct,
justice
kennedy.
mr.
patrick
irvine
that's
correct,
your
honor,
but
this
issue
of
federal
contractors
has
never
been
addressed
by
the
court.
the
existence
of
the
federal
government
as
a
party
to
the
contract
really
changes
the
nature
of
the
analysis
because
the
federal
sovereign
is
such
an
overwhelming
presence.
the
federal
government
does
not
need
the
courts
to
protect
it
from
states.
it
hasn't
hesitated
to...
to
sue
states
when
it
felt
that
the
taxes
were
not...
not
supported
by
the
law.
the
categorical
test
that
we
argue
for
would
apply
just
to
federal
contractors
as
it
does
with
any
federal
contractor
throughout
the
country.
mr.
patrick
irvine
that's
correct,
your
honor.
and
if
it...
if
a
contract
still
involved
a
contract
with
someone
other
than
the
federal
government,
the
court's
analysis,
the
balancing
test,
the
particularized
inquiry
would
still
be
effective,
though
as
we
argue
in
our
brief,
the
lower
court
misapplied
that
analysis
as
well
just
because
it
didn't
take
into
account
that
tribal
sovereignty,
tribal
interests
are
not
really
affected
in
any
significant
way
when
it's
a
contract
between
a
nontribal
member
and
a
nonmember
such
as
the
united
states
itself.
mr.
patrick
irvine
your
honor,
i
think
the...
this
court
has
consistently
held,
both
in
the
context
of
federal
contractors
and
even
contracts
on
reservations,
that
the
very
fact
that
there
may
be
economic
effects
are
not
sufficient
to
preempt
the
tax.
in
the
case
involving
a
federal
contractor,
that's
even
more
applicable.
as
this
court
held
in
the
united
states
v.
new
mexico,
even
if
the
cost
is
directly
passed
on
to
the
federal
government,
that's
not
ground
for
preemption.
in
u.s.
v.
new
mexico,
i
believe
it
was
a
cost-plus
contract,
so
there
was
no
doubt
that
the
cost
was
passed
on
to
the
federal
government.
economic
effects
themselves
are
not
sufficient
to...
to
preempt
the
tax.
as
the
united
states
points
out
in
its
brief,
merely
because
there's
a
tax
on
the
federal
contractor
does
not
necessarily
mean
that
there
will
be
an
impact
on
the...
the
number...
the
amount
of
roads
built
or
the
amount
of
work
done
because
it
will
hinge
on
what
the
agency
does,
what
congress
does
in
their
appropriations.
there's
no
evidence
that
congress
hasn't
appropriated
funds
taking
into
account
the
full
amount
of
the
taxes
and
equally
could
reduce
the
appropriation
if
there's
a
less...
5
percent
less
because
of
the
tax.
so,
the
economic
effects
are
a
difficult
standard
to
apply
and
this
court
has
generally
rejected
it
in
the
federal...
federal
contractor
context,
as
well
as
tribal...
reservation
transactions.
mr.
patrick
irvine
i
believe
they
would
be.
they
are
direct
contracts
with
the
federal
government.
mr.
patrick
irvine
that's
correct,
justice
scalia.
and,
indeed,
by
looking
at
economic
effects,
that's
always
a
difficult
test
to
apply
because
it's
very
unpredictable.
this
is
a
tax
which
means
that
both
the
contractors
and
the
federal
government
benefit
by
having
certainty
and
predictability
knowing
when
the
contract
is
issued
whether
it's
subject
to
tax,
which
is
why
we
focus
on
who
the
contracting
parties
are
as
opposed
to
a
more
amorphous
standard,
which
may
very
well
apply
in
the
context
when
tribal
interests
are
affected
but
where
the
federal
sovereign
is
a
party
to
the
contract
and
can
certainly
protect
itself
from
overreaching
state
taxes.
those
considerations
just
aren't
an
issue.
there
really
is
no
reason
to
apply
a
different
rule
than
the
categorical
bright
line
test
for
reservation
transactions
because
the
cases
this
court
has...
has
decided
involving
reservation
transactions
that
apply
a
different
test
have
all
involved
effects
on
tribes
and
tribal
members,
contracts
with
tribes
or
tribal
members,
costs
that
are
directly
passed
on
to
tribal
treasuries.
the
court
has
repeatedly
drawn
the
line,
saying
that
protecting
tribal
sovereignty,
tribal
interest
is
really
what
the
key
is
in...
in
applying
a
different
test.
indian
sovereignty,
as
the
court
has
described,
provides
the
backdrop
against
which
the
applicable
treaties
must
be
read.
here
tribal
sovereignty
is
not
endangered
by
a
tax
on
a
federal
contractor
because
if
there
is
any
danger,
it's
to
the
federal
government
which,
as
i've
stated,
can
protect
itself.
merely
because
the
cost
is
passed
on
to
the
federal
government
or
even
to
a
tribe
is
not
sufficient
in
and
of
itself.
there
must
be
essentially
the
state
reaching
into
the
reservation
and
trying
to
regulate
a
transaction
with
a
tribe.
applying
state
laws
to
tribal
members
on
the
reservation
is
what
this
court
has
consistently
sought
to
protect.
it
has
not
sought
to
protect
nonmembers
or
the
federal
government
from
the
reach
of
state
laws
anywhere
within
the
state.
the
court
has,
over
the
past
150
years
or
so,
tried
to
develop
different
analysis,
the
intergovernmental
tax
immunity
doctrine
that
the
court
discussed
in
detail
in
cotton
petroleum,
but
the
court
has
come
around
to
the
idea
that
that
is
just
too
difficult.
the
standard
should
be
is
the
legal
incidence
of
the
tax
on
the
federal
government.
if
it
is
not,
the
tax
should
be
sustained.
if
you
try
to
look
through
the
transaction,
you
do
end
up
with
a
fairly
free-wheeling
balancing
test
which
is
difficult
to
apply
certainly
in
advance,
sometimes
even
at
all.
even
if
the
court
doesn't
apply
a
categorical
test,
as
we've
argued
under
the
implied
preemption
analysis,
the
lower
court
erred
because
it
didn't
give
sufficient
weight
to
the
state's
interest
in
regulating
activities
throughout
the
state,
including
on
reservations.
in
this
case,
state
law
does
not...
is
not
imposed
on
any
transaction
involving
a
tribal
member
or
a
tribe.
there's
no
impact
on
tribal
sovereignty.
cotton
petroleum
certainly
held
that
state
taxes
are
permissible
if
they
do
not
directly
and
substantially
affect
tribal
interests.
other
cases
of
this
court
hold
the
same,
particularly
the
tobacco
cases...
excuse
me...
where
the
court
has
consistently
found
that
the
state
has
an
interest
in
taxing
sales
to
nonmembers
of
cigarette
products
and
other
products
even
though
it
has
economic
impact
on
the
tribe,
even
though
the
tribe,
indeed,
is
the
seller.
so,
in
those
cases,
the
tribe
or
the
tribal
member
is
actually
a
party
to
the
transaction,
but
the
court
has
said
that
the
state
has
an
interest
in
taxing
them.
the
state
has
not
looked
at
any
specific
services
that
are
required
in
those
tobacco
cases.
it
sort
of
accepted
the
fact
that
nonmembers
receive
services.
it
hasn't
required
a
direct
connection
with
those...
with
the
taxed
activities,
and
consistently
applying
those
precedents
leads
to
the
line
again
that
the
court
will
seek
to
protect
taxes
that
directly
impact
on
tribes
but
will
not
seek
to
protect
nonmembers
merely
because
they
do
business
on
reservations.
these
transactions
do
take
place
within
the
state
of
arizona,
and
that's
the
key
element
here.
and
just
because
they're
on
a
reservation
does
not
mean
different
rules
should
apply
if
tribal
sovereignty
is
not
implicated,
and
the
court
has
required
that
that
really
be
the
test.
mr.
patrick
irvine
that's
a
very
indirect
impact,
your
honor,
and
i
think
if...
every
tax
will
have
an
effect
on
decision
making.
the
absence
of
a
tax
will
have
an
effect
on
decision
making.
and
if
the
change...
the
effect
on
decision
making
is
the
test,
it
becomes
almost
impossible
to
apply.
in
this
case,
the
decisions
are
made
by
the
federal
government
which
has
accepted
tribal
input,
but
ultimately
the
burden
of
the
tax
rests
on
the
contractor
which
does
business
with
the
federal
government
which,
under
its
own
sovereign
powers,
has
the
right
to
make
the
decisions
that
it
chooses
to
make.
and
so,
there
really
is
no
direct
or
substantial
effect
on
tribal
decision
making
because
the
state
is
taxing
parties
that
the
tribe
does
not...
or
that
the
contractor
does
not
even
do...
do
business
with.
and
the
federal
government
in
this
case,
because
of
its
own
sovereignty,
is
not...
is
the
major
party
here.
to
the...
even
under
the
implied
preemption
analysis,
if
there
is
a
passing
on
of
the
tax
to
anyone,
it's
to
the
federal
government.
it's
not
the
tribe.
this
court's
decisions
upholding
the
tax...
the
taxes
on
nonmembers
would
really
govern
here,
and
as
i
mentioned,
the
lower
court
just
gave
too
little
weight
to
the
very
fact
that
the
state
does
have
sovereign
interests
throughout
the
state,
including
on
indian
reservations.
the
only
limitation
is
when
there
is
an
impact
on
tribal
sovereignty.
in
this
case,
the
contract
takes
place
on
a
reservation,
but
the
direct
impact
of
the
tax
is
on
that
contract
between
blaze
and
the
federal
government.
any
effects
on
tribal
sovereignty
are
very
indirect,
and
therefore,
even
under
the
implied
preemption
analysis,
there
should
be
no...
there
should
be
no
preemption
here.
if
the
court
has
no
further
questions,
i
will
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time.
mr.
patrick
irvine
thank
you,
your
honor.
i
met
mr.
ward
at
the
hearing.
i
think
i've
met
a
lot
of
mr.
wards
in
different
capacities.
and
i
think
officials
at
that
level
want
a
clear
rule.
mr.
ward,
i'm
sure,
wants
to
be
able
to
tell
the
people,
the
contractors,
whether
it's
taxable
or
not.
if
the
test
is
we
don't
know
because
it
depends
on
whether
the
state
provides
services,
we
don't
know
because
it
depends
on
which
statute
authorizes
the
funding
and
what
may
apply,
that's
no
help
to
mr.
ward.
it's
no
help
to
blaze
construction.
it's
no
help
to
the
state
of
arizona
in
deciding
whether
the
tax
is
permissible.
so,
in
terms
of...
of
the
interest
of...
of
lower
levels
of
the
bia,
i
would
think
a...
a
clear
bright
line
rule,
as
the
united
states
itself
argues
here,
should
be
the
answer.
in
terms
of
multiple
sovereignties,
here
there
is
a
clash
between
only
two
sovereigns,
the
state
and
the
federal
government.
the
tribe
is
not
a
party
to
the
transaction.
the
transactions
take
place
on
the
reservation,
but
the
tribe
is...
is
not
affected
except
indirectly
through
the
federal
sovereignty.
the
agency
certainly
is
the
bureau
of
indian
affairs
which
does
have
trust
responsibilities
to
the
tribes,
but
that's
a
function
which
is...
is
between
the
tribes
and
the
federal
government.
it's
not
something
that
the
state
is
involved
in.
there's
nothing
in
the
record
that
shows
that
congress
expects
the
state
of
arizona
to
help
the
bia
pay
its
bills
by
not
imposing
its
taxes.
and
certainly
there
can
be
interference
with
tribal
decision
making
because
of
a
state
tax,
but
if
there
is
no
tax
on
federal
contractors,
there
can
equally
be
interference
with
bureau
of
indian
affairs
decision
making.
would
the
bureau
then
have
to
decide
whether
to
construct
projects
on
the
reservation
or
off
the
reservation
because
there
might
be
some
tax
effect?
the
indian
health
service
has
a
hospital
in
phoenix,
good
transportation,
good
other
health
care.
if
there's
a
tax
savings,
should
they
be
enticed
to
move
20
or
30
miles
to
a
reservation
just
because
of
the
tax
effects?
as
i
mentioned
earlier,
there's
always
an
effect
of...
on...
there's
always
an
effect
on
decision
making
whether
there
is
or
isn't
a
tax.
finally,
as
far
as
the
self-determination
act
goes,
that
doesn't
even
apply
to
the
contracts
at
issue.
these
contracts
were
not
between
the
tribe
and
the
contractor.
each
of
the
tribes
chose
not
to
exercise
their
option
under
the
self-determination
act.
this
court
has
never
preempted
a
tax
on
a
reservation
based
on
a
statutory
scheme
that
doesn't
even
apply
to
the
regulated
activity,
and
i
suggest
it
shouldn't
here
either.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i'll
conclude
with
that.
