william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
now
in
number
97-6203,
nathaniel
jones
v.
the
united
states.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
so
far
as
the
increase
in
sentencing
is
concerned
as
a
result
of
finding
these
factors,
this
isn't
as
great
as
almendarez-torres.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes,
but
that
were
not...
that
wasn't
the
case
here.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
we've
come
a
long
way
from
mullaney
v.
wilbur.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
patterson...
yes.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
would
our
system
be
any
better
off
if
we
went...
if
we
repealed
the
sentencing
guidelines
and
went
back
to
the
situation
where
the
judges
didn't
say
what
they
were
taking
into
consideration,
but
two
people
would
end
up
in
leavenworth
convicted
of
the
same
crime,
one
was
committed
for
2
years
and
the
other
was
committed
for
20
years?
when
congress
tried
to
regularize
that,
have
they
made
it
subject
to
a
lot
of
constitutional
objections
that,
as
justice
breyer
says,
the
process
wasn't
subject
to
before
because
no
one
explained
their
reasons?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
don't
you
think
the
defendant
could
suffer
by
having
the
fact
of
serious
bodily
injury
or
death
being
brought
before
the
jury?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
if
that's
true
with
respect
to
bodily
injury
it's
also
true
of
a
prior
conviction.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
in
the
old
chief
case
it
was
disputed
as
just
what
should
be
the
form
of
presenting
the
prior
conviction
to
the
jury.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
denvir.
mr.
dumont,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it's
the
piling
on
of,
you
know,
on
top
of
a
1-year
sentence
a
20-year
sentence.
the...
it...
to
me
it's
the
disproportion
between
the
sentence
that
is
piled
on
and
the
initial
sentence.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
which
i
don't
think
you
have
here.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
in
mcmillan,
didn't
we
say
a
preponderance
was
enough
on
the
facts
of
that
case?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
defendant's
attorney
certainly
has
notice
that
this
is
going
to
be
a
factor
considered
at
sentencing
in
a
way
that
he
might
not
at
the
other...
in
the
old
type
of
hearing.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mm-hmm,
thanks.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
dumont.
mr.
denvir,
you
have
3
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
denvir.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
now
in
no.
97-9361,
louis
jones
v.
united
states.
mr.
crooks.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
crooks.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
97-6203,
jones
against
united
states
will
be
announced
by
justice
souter.
