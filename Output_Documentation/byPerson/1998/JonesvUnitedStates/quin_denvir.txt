mr.
quin
denvir
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
issues
presented
by
mr.
jones'
case
are,
first,
whether
in
selecting
certain
factors
to
increase
the
sentence
from
carjacking
from
15
years
maximum
to
25
to
life,
congress
intended
those
factors
be
considered
only
at
the
time
of
sentencing
under
a
reduced
standard
of
proof,
or
did
they...
congress
intend
that
they
be
elements
of
an
offense
which
would
have
to
be
pled
and
proved
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
to
a
jury.
we
believe
that
the
proper
interpretation
is
that
these
are
offense
elements.
if
the
court
should
decide
otherwise,
then
the
court
would
have
to
face
the
constitutionality
of
treating
these
types
of
factors
only
as
sentencing
factors.
mr.
quin
denvir
i
don't
think
it
is...
has
been
defined.
it
may
have
been
defined
in
winship,
when
the
court
held
that
the
prosecution
had
to
prove
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
all
the
facts
that
constituted
the
offense
with
which...
of
which
the
defendant
is
charged.
that
may
have
been
the
closest
to
a
definition,
but
i
don't
think
there's
any
definitive
definition,
at
least
that
i'm
aware
of.
mr.
quin
denvir
that
may
be
correct,
your
honor.
i
think
what...
as
i
say,
the
court
talked
about
facts
necessary
to
constitute
the
offense
with
which
someone
is
charged.
on
the
other
hand,
in
mcmillan
for
the
first
time
the
court
did
use
the
term
sentencing
factors,
and
that
appears
to
be
a
term
that
the
court
has
said
can
be
proved
at...
to
the
judge
only
under
reduced
standard
of
proof
and
perhaps
by
a
lesser
form
of
evidence
that--
mr.
quin
denvir
--it's
almost...
i
think
it's
the
reverse
of
the
sentencing
factor.
we've
argued
it's
either
an
element
of
the
offense,
an
element
of
an
aggravated
offense,
should
be
deemed
an
element
of
the
offense,
but
i
think
the
major
point
we
believe
is
that
it
has
to
be
alleged
in
the
indictment
and
it
has
to
be
proved
to
a
jury
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
mr.
quin
denvir
it
does,
your
honor,
and--
mr.
quin
denvir
--well,
your
honor,
i
think
our
position
is
that
you
have
to
look
to
the
statute
and
see
whether
congress
has
identified
a
particular
factor
of
any
kind,
and
has
used
that
or
made
that
the
basis
for
an
increased
sentencing
range.
i
think
a
separate
question
which
we
don't--
mr.
quin
denvir
--well,
your
honor,
i
think
the
question
that
the
court
posed
in
almendarez-torres
was,
what
was
congress'
intent?
was
it
intended
to
be
merely
a
sentencing
factor
or
not?
mr.
quin
denvir
on
the
statutory
question,
your
honor,
i
think
we
have
a
much
different
statute
and
we
have
a
much
stronger
argument
that
these
were
not
meant
to
be
sentencing
factors.
on
the
constitutional
question,
we
don't
believe
that
almendarez-torres
resolves
that,
because
we
believe
that
the
court
stressed
so
strongly
in
almendarez-torres
the
fact
that
what
congress
had
selected
to
trigger
the
increase
in
sentence
was
recidivism,
and
the
court
said
in
both
the
constitutional
and
statutory
parts
of
it
that
recidivism
has
been
as
traditional
a
sentencing
factor
as
ever,
and
has
been--
mr.
quin
denvir
--i
think
the--
mr.
quin
denvir
--it
has
been
that,
but
it
has
not
been
limited
to
sentencing.
i
think
that
was
the
point
that
the
court
seemed
to
make
in
almendarez-torres.
mr.
quin
denvir
you
mean
the
amount
of
the
increase?
mr.
quin
denvir
well,
it
would
be
if
the
death
had
resulted
as
a
serious
bodily
injury.
mr.
quin
denvir
no,
that's
correct,
but
the
actual
increase
is
not
as
great.
but
i
think,
if
i
could
go
back
to
justice
o'connor's
question,
i
think--
mr.
quin
denvir
--well,
we
believe,
and
i
believe--
mr.
quin
denvir
--that's
correct.
mr.
quin
denvir
i
don't
believe
that
the
gov...
i
think
the
government
and
we
agree
that
there's
no
distinction
between
serious
bodily
injury
resulting,
and
death
resulting,
at
least
in
terms
of
interpreting
the
statute,
that
they're
either
both
elements
of
the
offense
or
something
of
that
nature,
the
opposite
of
a
sentencing
factor,
or
they
are
sentencing
factors.
but
i
think
that
the
key
point
in
almendarez-torres,
at
least
it
appeared
from
what
the
court
wrote,
was
that
the
recidivism
factor
of
prior
convictions
had
always
been
limited
to
sentencing.
it
had
never
been
used
as
an
element
of
the
offense.
mr.
quin
denvir
yes,
your
honor.
i
was
going
to
say
that.
that's
the
only
occasion,
and
i
think
that
what
the
opinion--
mr.
quin
denvir
--well,
i
think
that's
the
only
time
it
was
used,
your
honor,
and
as
i
read
the
opinion,
and
the
court
made
a
point
that
it
had
never
been
used
as
an
element
of
an
offense
where
the
conduct
was
already
illegal.
the
court
said
that
twice,
made
that
point,
acknowledged
the
unusual
situation
of--
mr.
quin
denvir
--i'm
sorry,
your
honor.
mr.
quin
denvir
this
was
the
point
that
the
court
made,
that
congress
had
not
done
that.
mr.
quin
denvir
congress
had
not
made
recidivism
a...
that
was
the
point
the
majority
made
twice,
so
we
think
that
that's
quite
different
here,
because
what
you
find
is
that
congress
clearly
has
made
serious
bodily
injury
an
element
of
several
offenses
which
we
have
cited,
and
in
fact
that
the
states,
who
have
traditionally
dealt
with
robbery,
have
almost
invariably
treated
serious
bodily
injury
as
an
element
of
the
offense,
or
at
least
something
that
must
be
pled
and
proved
to
the
jury
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
mr.
quin
denvir
i
think--
mr.
quin
denvir
--no,
your
honor.
i
think
if
you
look
at
in
re
winship
and
you
look
at
mullaney
v.
wilbur
you
have
the
basic
idea
that
a
fact
which
is
an
element
of
the
crime,
which
is
necessary
to
constitute
the
crime,
must
be
proved
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
mr.
quin
denvir
i
think
that's--
mr.
quin
denvir
--i
think
it
has,
your
honor,
and
as
i
understand
it
the
court
in
mcmillan
has
said
if
it
is
merely
a
fact
which
restrains
the
sentencer's
discretion
within
the
statutory
range,
that
it
need
not
go
to
a
jury,
and
then
in
almendarez-torres
the
court
said,
if
it
is
a
recidivist
factor
which
increases
the
statutory
range,
it
need
not
go
to
the
jury.
but--
mr.
quin
denvir
--well,
your
honor--
mr.
quin
denvir
--i
understand
that,
your
honor,
and
i
think
it
partly
goes
to
what
is
the
definition
of
a
criminal
offense
and
what
conduct
is
ascribed
to
a
violation
of
that,
and
i'd
like
to
give
you
a
example
of,
if
what
you
say
is
correct,
what
could
happen,
and
i
don't...
this
was
really...
was
envisioned
by
the
dissenting
justices
in
the
monge
case.
but
we
have
18
u.s.
code
section
247.
it
says
that
someone
who
intentionally
defaces
real
property,
or
intentionally
obstructs
a
person
in
the
enjoyment
of
their
religious
freedom,
is...
shall
be
punished
as
in
subsection
(d).
subsection
(d)
says
that
if
death
results,
or
if
the
acts
include
kidnapping
or
intent
to
kidnap,
you
can
receive
life
or
death.
if
bodily
injury
results,
or...
and
other
things,
it
can
be
40
years.
if
it's
bodily
injury
under
other
circumstances
it
can
be
20
years,
and
in
any
other
case,
it
is
1
year
or
a
fine.
now,
the
solicitor
general's
position
is,
and
i
think
the
position
that
would
follow
from
what
you've
said
is
that
the
jury
would
only
determine
whether
there
was
this
intentional
defacing
real
property,
or
interference
with
religious
rights,
and
then...
which
would
only
trigger
a
fine
or
a
1-year
sentence,
but
the
judge
then
would
make
all
of
these
critical
findings
which
would
really
determine
this
person's
deprivation
of
liberty--
mr.
quin
denvir
--certainly,
your
honor,
and--
mr.
quin
denvir
--it
certainly
did.
mr.
quin
denvir
that's
correct.
mr.
quin
denvir
no,
it
isn't
at
all,
and
it
raises
the
possibility
in
this
case,
for
instance,
if
mr.
jones
had
pled
guilty
to
the
carjacking
as
charged,
and
during
the
time
between
his
guilty
plea
and
sentencing
the
person
had
died,
he
would
have
just
gone
from
15
years
to
in
this
case
a
potential
sentence
of
life
imprisonment.
but
i
think
the
other
thing
in
response
to
justice
breyer's
question
is,
i
don't
think
you
can...
you
can
really
quantify
what
judges
have
done
in
the
past,
because
judges
sometimes
don't
express
all
that.
but
i
think
the
key
point
is,
we've
always
thought,
at
least
in
re
winship
says
that,
that
a
jury
is
the
most
reliable
determiner
of
these
basic
facts
as
to
what
a
person
did
that
was
wrong,
and
what
exactly
will
trigger
the
potential
deprivation
of
liberty
that
he
or
she
faces,
and
in
this
particular
case,
the
serious
bodily
injury
resulting
factor,
a
factor
that
only
arose
at
the
time
of
sentencing,
in
effect
increased
the
sentence
that
mr.
jones
was
facing
by
two-thirds.
mr.
quin
denvir
well,
your
honor,
i
think
that
once
again
we
are
not
challenging
the
fact
that
congress
can
pick
out
particular
factors
that
will
restrict
the
sentencing
authority's
discretion
within
the
statutory
range.
what
we
have
here,
and
which
we
think
is
critical,
is,
you
have
the
definition
of
a
criminal
offense
and
the
attaching
of
potential
penalties
by
congress,
and
we
think
at
that
point
those
facts
that
trigger
that
increase,
all
the
way
up
to
death
or
life,
are
facts
that
should
be
determined
by
a
jury,
because
that's
the
most
reliable
way
it
should
be
done.
mr.
quin
denvir
your
honor--
mr.
quin
denvir
--they
are
facts
of
that
nature,
but
i
think
what
was
pointed
out
in
almendarez-torres
is
that
the
fact
of
a
prior
conviction
first
of
all
is
not
often
disputed.
number
2,
it
has
been
the
subject
of
a
prior
proceeding
where
you
had
the
kind
of
reliable
fact-finding--
mr.
quin
denvir
--well--
mr.
quin
denvir
--well,
it
may
be
as
to
whether
that
death
resulted
from
this
crime,
and
certainly
in
a
case
like
we
have
here
there
is
certainly
a
substantial
question
as
to
whether
this
was
serious
bodily
injury
as
defined
by
the
statute.
but
these
are
traditional
components
of
the
prohibited
transaction
that
juries
make
factual
findings
on
under
a
higher
standard
because
we
want
that
reliability,
we
want
that
public
confidence
in
the
soundness
of
the
decision.
that's
why
the
elements
of
the
crime
are
ascribed
to
the
jury--
mr.
quin
denvir
--and
your
honor,
we
have
no
quarrel
with
that,
whether
it's
done
under
a
sentencing
guideline-type
scheme,
as
we
have
in
the
federal
courts,
or
under
another
scheme,
but
the
fact
of
the
matter
is,
we're
talking
about
the
definition
of
the
range
of
potential
penalties.
we're
not
talking
about
what
determines
the
penalty
within
that
range,
and
i
think--
mr.
quin
denvir
--they
don't
have
to,
and
they--
mr.
quin
denvir
--right,
and
they
can
determine--
mr.
quin
denvir
--they
are
bound
to
look
at
an
increased
range
of
25
years,
based
on
that
finding.
mr.
quin
denvir
again,
your
honor,
i
think
that's
the
mcmillan
case,
and
the
court
has
said
that
if
congress
or
the
legislator
singles
out
a
factor
which
will
either
control
or
guide
the
discretion
of
the
sentencing
authority
within
the
statutory
range
of
punishment,
that
that
does
not
raise
these
concerns,
but
this
is
a
different
matter.
mr.
quin
denvir
it
does
not
fix
it
at
20,
but
it
exposes
him.
mr.
quin
denvir
based
on
a
factual
finding
that
was
not
made
by
a
jury,
it
was
not
made
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
and
it
was
not
subject
to
the
traditional
safeguards.
mr.
quin
denvir
that's
correct,
your
honor,
and
the
only
case
that
the
court
has
decided
in
that
range
is
the
recidivism
question,
and
the
court
selected
certain
factors
about
that
that
apparently
were
critical.
one
was
that
traditionally
recidivism
prior
convictions
had
been
limited
to
sentencing,
had
not
been
used
as
elements.
the
second
was,
they
were
very
seldom
disputed.
the
third
thing
was
that
they
were
easily
verifiable.
the
fourth
thing
was
that
the
prior
conviction
had
been
the
subject
of
reliable
fact-finding
either
by
a
jury
trial
or
an
informed
waiver
of
that
trial,
and
all
those
factors
are
really
important.
the
other
thing
that
the
court
cited
was
the
fact
that
the
defendant
could
suffer
from
having
that
prior
conviction
brought
before
the
trier
of
fact
jury,
and
that...
as
another
reason.
none
of
those
apply
when
you're
talking
about
a
particular
part
of
the
criminal
conduct
that
has
been
singled
out.
mr.
quin
denvir
your
honor,
first
of
all,
in
the
carjacking
statute
it
is
likely
that
will
come
in
anyway,
because
the
government
will
try
to
use
it
to
show
that
the
taking
was
by
force
or...
force
and
violence
or
by
intimidation,
so
it's
already
going
to
go
before
the
jury.
if
a
particular
defendant
wants
to
keep
that
out,
he
always
has
the
opportunity
to
seek
a
bifurcation
on
that
issue,
or
to
stipulate
to
the
issue,
but
we
think
the
defendant
should
be
able
to
make
the
choice
as
to
whether
they
will
have
the
jury
hear
these
and
make
a
reliable
fact-finding--
mr.
quin
denvir
--it
is,
your
honor,
except
for
the
fact
that
that's
seldom
disputed,
and
generally
it
has
been
found
reliably
in
the
past,
where
serious
bodily
injury
is
a
brand-new
issue
and
should
be
found
under
this
higher
standard
by
a
more
reliable
fact-finder.
mr.
quin
denvir
that's
correct,
and
there
would
be
ways,
perhaps
under
old
chief
or
by
seeking
bifurcation,
that
a
defendant
who
did
not
want
this
information
to
go
before
the
jury
could
keep
it
out,
if
the
government
was
not
already
seeking
to
bring
it
in
to
show
force
and
violence
or
intimidation,
which
are
elements
of
the
statute.
mr.
quin
denvir
i'm
not
sure
that
the
constitution
require,
but
i
think
a
court
would
have
that...
the
discretion
to
bifurcate
it
in
the
proper
case.
mr.
quin
denvir
with
the
prior
convictions.
in
the
states
at
least
they
used
to
routinely
bifurcate--
mr.
quin
denvir
--your
honor,
i
don't
believe
it
would
require
it.
i
think
all
it
would
require
that
the
fact
of
serious
bodily
injury
resulting
would
be
added
as
to
one
of
the
elements
that
the
jury
must
find
in
order
to
convict
the
defendant
of
that
particular
crime,
just
like
possession
of
a
weapon.
mr.
quin
denvir
it
may
be
possible
on
any
given
case
that
you
could
have
a
lesser-included
offense,
which
would
be
the
simple
case
of
carjacking,
which
happens
in
bank
robbery
statutes.
we
have
armed
bank
robbery.
we
have
bank
robbery.
those
are
sometimes
both
submitted
to
the
jury,
and
that
could
happen,
i
would
think,
in
this
case.
mr.
quin
denvir
--it
has
been
done--
mr.
quin
denvir
--with
prior
convictions
where--
mr.
quin
denvir
--that's
correct.
mr.
quin
denvir
that--
mr.
quin
denvir
--certainly
it
does.
mr.
quin
denvir
it's
an
indeterminate
sentencing
law.
mr.
quin
denvir
i
think--
mr.
quin
denvir
--i
think...
i
think
if
a
statute
was
passed
which
provided
that
carjacking
would
control
up
to
life,
and
if
the
statute
also
said
that
there
was
a
determining,
unless
there
was
serious
bodily
injury,
it
couldn't
be
more
than
15
years,
and
something
of
that
nature,
that
would
raise
different
questions
than
are
presented
here.
the
court
in
almendarez-torres
reserved
the
question,
the
question
presented
there,
whether
the
role
of
a
particular
factor
within
the
statutory
authority,
could
be
so
great
that
it
would
require
greater
constitutional
safeguards.
mr.
quin
denvir
i
think,
as
i
say,
i...
to
accomplish
what
you
wanted,
but
it
raises
different
questions
in
here,
than
the
statute
we
have
here,
it
could
be
provided
that
carjacking
carries
up
to
a
life
sentence,
and
that...
but
you
cannot
sentence
for
more
than
15
years
unless
there's
serious
bodily
injury,
and
you
can't
go
for
more
than
25
years
unless
there
is
death
resulting.
that
would
be
a
way
to
write--
mr.
quin
denvir
--no,
i
don't
think
that
would
be
okay.
the
question
was--
mr.
quin
denvir
--i
don't
think
they
can,
your
honor.
mr.
quin
denvir
that's
our
basic
position,
your
honor.
mr.
quin
denvir
i
was
trying
to
respond
to
the
california--
mr.
quin
denvir
--that--
mr.
quin
denvir
--well,
our
position
is,
the
statute
that's
before
this
court,
which
parallels,
as
i
say,
this
section
247,
takes
this...
takes
certain
factors
and
says
to
a
defendant,
if
those
factors
are
found
to
be
true,
then
you
will
look
at
an
additional
10
years,
or
perhaps
all
the
way
to
life,
or
now,
under
the
amendments,
to
death.
we
believe
that
those
factors
which
are
components
of
the
crime,
the
prohibited
transaction,
must
be
alleged
in
the
indictment,
must
be
submitted
to
a
jury,
and
must
be
proved
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
mr.
quin
denvir
no,
your
honor.
what
we
want
is,
we
want
the
elements
of
the
offense
that
have
to
be
proved
in
order
to
deprive
our
clients
of
liberty,
that
they
should
be
set
forth...
presented
to
a
grand
jury,
set
forth
in
an
indictment,
submitted
to
a
jury
under
a
general
instruction
as
to
elements,
and
proved
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
before
our
clients
face
that
additional
penalty.
that's
what
we
want.
mr.
quin
denvir
i
really
don't
think
special
verdicts
are
required.
i
think
it's
just
a
question
of
including
it
in
the
elements
of
the
offense.
it
may
also
then
have
a
lesser
included
in
any
given
case.
but
that's
done
all
the
time
in
federal
court.
the
bank
robbery
statutes
are
done
that
way.
in
fact,
the
court
has
a
case
along
those
lines
coming
up
about
lesser
includeds.
if
i
could
reserve
my
time.
mr.
quin
denvir
thank
you,
your
honor.
i
would
like
to
address
quickly,
if
i
could,
the
statutory
question,
which
we
believe
this
statute
should
be
construed
as
not
setting
forth
sentencing
factors.
the
government's
position
is
that,
to
identify
three
offenses
in
the
text
of
the
section,
the
statute's
three
penalty
clauses
would
have
to
be
read
as
alternative
completions
for
the
offense
definition
begun
in
the
initial
paragraph,
and
each
completed
alternative,
taken
as
a
whole,
would
then
be
read
to
define
a
separate
criminal
offense.
we
believe
that's
exactly
what
happened
there,
that
if
you
take
everything
before
the
dash,
you
do
not
have
a
criminal
offense.
it
does
not
say
it's
unlawful,
it
does
not
say
it
is
prohibited,
it
does
not
say
it
will
be
punished
in
a
certain
way.
it
is
only
when
you
go
past
the
dash
to
1,
2,
and
3
that
you
get
alternative
completions
to
that...
to
the
introductory
part,
alternative
offenses.
but
if
the
court
should
not
rule
in
our
favor
on
the
statutory
construction
question,
on
the
constitutional
question,
i'd
like
to
make
one
more
try,
if
i
could,
on
what
i...
what
we
believe
is
required.
it
appears
that
what
the
legislature
does
in
enacting
a
criminal
offense
is,
it
tells
the
citizenry
that
if
you
engage
in
particular
conduct,
then
you
will
be
sentenced...
you
will
potentially
face
a
particular
sentence,
a
certain
loss
of
liberty,
and
then
we
know
that
behind
that,
behind
the
constitution
is
the
idea
that
those
facts,
that
to
establish
that
conduct
which
leads
to
that
loss
of
liberty
is
something
that
goes
to
a
jury
and
is
proved
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
we
think
that
what
the
court
should
hold
is,
if
there's
any
fact
that
the
legislature
singles
out
from
a
transaction,
from
the
citizen's
conduct,
whether
it
is
an
action,
whether
it
is
a
mental
state,
or
whether
it's
a
result,
that
should
be
treated
as
an
element
of
the
offense,
and
it
ought
to
go
to
a
jury.
a
jury
trial
is
not
something
that
has
to
be
avoided.
a
jury
is...
under
our
jurisprudence
is
supposed
to
be
the
most
reliable
determiner
of
that,
and
we
would
have
a
higher...
this...
the
whole
idea
is
kind
of,
if
we
can
hide
these
as
sentencing
factors,
we
won't
let
a
jury
deal
with
them.
that
seems
to
me
contrary
to
our
constitution,
to
the
values
that
we
have
in
proof
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
and
jury
trials,
and
i
think
what
i've
suggested
to
you
would
fit
very
easy.
all
it
means
is
that
there
would
be
a
different
definition
given
to
the
jury
and
they
would
play
their
traditional
role
of
making
factual
findings
about
the
defendant
that
subjects
that
defendant
to
a
particular
punishment.
i
think
that
that
is...
that
seems
to
me
that's
consonant
with
our
constitution
and
with
those
valued
principles,
and
this
trying
to
somehow
say
we
can
treat
it
differently,
we
can
call
it
a
sentencing
factor,
we
can
go
over
the
standard,
we
can
get
the
jury
out
of
it,
just
is
contrary
to
what
we
think
criminal
offenses
are
and
what
they
mean
to
our
citizens.
they
should
know,
if
you
do
this,
you
will
have
a
right
to
have
a
jury
determine
it,
and
if
you...
and
if
they
find
that
you've
engaged
in
that
conduct,
then
you
could
be
sentenced
in
this
particular
way.
