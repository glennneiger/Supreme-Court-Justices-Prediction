mr.
edward
c.
dumont
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
our
view,
congress
intended
serious
bodily
injury
to
be
a
sentencing
factor,
statutory
sentencing
factor
under
section
2119,
and
nothing
in
the
constitution
requires
that
it
be
treated
as
an
element
of
the
offense.
let
me
pause
for
a
moment
in
the
language
and
structure
of
the
statute.
the
initial
paragraph,
section
2119,
as
it
applies
here,
sets
out
exactly
what
you
would
expect
from
a
federal
carjacking
offense,
taking
a
car
that
is
moved
in
commerce,
in
the
person
or
presence
of
another,
possessing
a
firearm,
force
and
violence...
it's
a
very
standard
robbery
offense.
that
initial
paragraph
ends
with
the
word
shall,
followed
by
a
dash,
leaving
the
reader
to
think,
all
right,
now
i'm
going
to
find
out
about
penalties,
and
then
you
have
three
numbered
clauses
that
follow
that
that
do
deal
with
penalties.
one
is
for
a
default
penalty
of
up
to
15
years,
and
then
two
progressively
higher
sentences
that
are
authorized
maximum
sentences
that
are
authorized
if
certain
findings
are
made.
in
our
view,
the
natural
and
plain
construction
of
that
language
is
that
these
are
statutory
sentencing
factors,
and
that's
what
the
courts
below
have
held.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
the
court
has
always
suggested
that
there
are
such
limits,
and
we
don't
oppose
that.
i'm
not
aware
of
any
statute
that
has
been
struck
down
on
that
ground.
i
think
one
reason
for
that
is
suggested,
in
fact,
by
justice
stevens'
dissent
in
mcmillan,
which
is
that
there
are
some
real-world
constraints
here.
legislatures
don't
pass
statutes
that
would
come
very
close
to
the
line
of
allowing,
as
the
metaphor
goes,
the
tail
of
sentencing
to
wag
the
dog
of
the
substantive
offense.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
well,
i--
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
--i
think
that--
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
--well,
i
think
first
of
all
that's
in
the
civil
rights
sections
of
the
statutes,
the
statutes
intended
to
address
defacement
of
religious
property
for
the
reasons
of
race
or
creed.
it's
a
very
serious
offense.
congress
was
responding
simply
to
some
known
problems.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
so--
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
--well,
that's
right,
but
i
think
the
fundamental
question,
then...
and
there
are...
one
can
multiply
the
examples
here.
the
assault
statute,
for
instance,
that
is
a
simple
assault,
but
if
someone
dies
there
could
be
life
imprisonment.
the
examples
are
there.
i
think
what
troubles
us
about
those
examples
when
we
hear
them
is
a
notion
of
proportionality,
that
it
would
be
disproportionate
to
send
someone
to
jail
for
life,
for
instance,
when
the
offense
of
conviction
is
merely
a
defacement
of
property
or
a
simple
assault.
i
think
that
would
be
an
interesting
and,
perhaps,
difficult
sentencing--
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
--well--
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
--we
certainly
don't
have
it
here,
and
i
think
the
question
in
those
cases
is
always
going
to
be,
well,
under
a
sort
of
proportionality
analysis,
could
congress
pass
this
statute
and
simply
say--
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
--it's
defacement
of
property
and
the
penalty
is
life,
and
as
justice
breyer
was
suggesting,
leave
it
up
to
the
judge.
would
we
have
a
problem
with
that?
in
individual
cases,
we
might.
if
a
death
was
found
we
might
not
have
a
problem
with
the
proportionality
there,
and
i
think
it
really
is
the
same
constitutional
analysis.
what
it
is
not
is
a
due
process
problem,
with
congress'
being
able
to
define
what
it
intends
to
be
elements
and
what
it
intends
to
be--
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
--that's
right.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
i
think
that's
absolutely
right,
and
i
think
it's
important
to
point
out
that
that's
exactly
what
the
result
would
be
if
this
statute
said,
as
it
might
very
well,
here
are
the
elements,
the
penalty
is
life,
now
go
to
the
guidelines,
and
congress
has,
of
course,
mandated
that
district
judges
obey
the
guidelines.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
well,
i
think
that
is
the
interesting
argument,
and
our
answer
to
that
is
no.
congress
can
do
it
either
way.
to
us
it
does
not
make
sense
to
say
that
there
are
many
options
congress
has.
it
can
set
a
determinate
sentence.
it
could
have
said,
for
every
carjacking,
the
sentence
is
40
years,
period.
we
know
from
chapman
and
other
cases
that
would
be
fine.
it
could
say...
no
discretion
to
anybody.
it
could
say,
apparently,
carjacking
is
this,
and
the
penalty
is
up
to
life.
the
judge
can
do
whatever
he
wants
to
and,
subject
to
some
very
lax
appellate
check,
there
is
no...
there's
plenary
discretion.
we
also
know
from
any
number
of
recent
cases
that
congress
can
commit
this
issue
to
the
sentencing
commission.
it
can
say,
all
right,
the
penalty
is
life.
the
sentencing
commission
now
may
exercise
its
discretion
to
actually
impose
quite
narrow
bounds
on
the
discretion
of
the
trial
judge,
and
that
is
perfectly
constitutional,
even
if
the
same
conduct,
for
instance,
was
not
charged,
or
was
charged
and
the
defendant
was
acquitted.
it
seems
to
us
quite
anomalous
to
say
that
as
a
constitutional
matter
congress
may
do
any
of
those
things,
but
what
it
may
not
do
is
direct
the
exercise
of
that
discretion,
the
sentencing
discretion
itself,
in
the
statute.
that
would
seem
to
us
a
very
strange
world,
where
it
can
delegate
this
authority
to
the
sentencing
commission,
but
it
can't
exercise
the
authority
itself.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
that's
absolutely
right.
this
statute
sets
some
statutory
maxima.
it
says
nothing
about...
it's
as
though
you
had
the
guidelines
but
with
the
possibility
of
downward
departure
but
not
the
possibility
of
upward
departure.
all
congress
has
done
here,
as
opposed
to
a
guidelines
system,
is
to
give
defendants
an
absolute
maximum
under
certain
circumstances,
whereas
under
the
guidelines
actually
they
wouldn't
have
that.
they
would
have
always
the
possibility
the
judge
would
choose
to
upward
depart,
and
they
could
go
up
to
life,
so
if
we're
talking
about
fundamental
fairness
to
the
defendants
here,
it
seems
to
us
this
scheme
is
much
more
protective
of
the
defendant's
rights
than
is
a
scheme
that
leaves
everything
up
to
the
sentencing
commission
or
to
the
sentencing
judge,
and
it
would
be
surpassingly
odd
for
there
to
be
a
due
process
problem.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
it's
a
finding
at
sentencing,
but
by
some
very
low
standard.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
i've
two
answers.
i
think
it
might
be
a
pretty
accurate
reflection
of
some
things
that
happened
under
an
indeterminate
system,
but
as
to
whether,
if
we
knew
that
was
what
was
happening
if
that
would
be
a
problem--
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
--well,
i
think
the
standard
of
proof
at
sentencing
can
raise
a
due
process
question,
yes.
i
think--
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
--all
the
court
has
ever
said
is--
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
--i
think
it
would
raise
some
concerns
if
you
were
allowed
to
sentence
on
the
basis
of
suspicion,
but
on
the
other
hand--
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
--well,
and
there
are
cases
that
say
that
clear
and
convincing
evidence
is
a
good
place
to
stop
in
between.
i
agree
that
it's
a
very
difficult
place
to
draw
lines.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
that
is
an
open
question.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
this
court
has
specifically
reserved
the
question.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
it
could
be
any.
i
mean,
accepted
practice
under
the
guidelines
is
that
preponderance
is
not
only
enough,
but
required.
it
could
be
a
constitutional
question.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
yes,
absolutely,
and
that's
always
been
the
standard,
and
that
is
sufficient,
and
no
one
has
tried
to
go
below
that,
so--
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
--well--
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
--i
think
that
is
the
logic
of
many
of
the
sentencing
cases.
i
mean,
that
argument
has
been
played
out
in
the
context
of
the
sentencing
guidelines,
and
the
argument
has
been
made
that
now
that
we
know
what
judges
are
doing
under
the
sentencing
guidelines
there
should
be
constitutional
consequences,
but
the
court
has
rejected
that
in
watts
and
witte,
so
in
our
view
that
question
is
settled.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
our
formulation
is
that...
and
this
is
going
to
be
a
little
unsatisfactory,
but
our
formulation
is
that
the
elements
of
proof
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
of
each
of
the
elements
of
the
offense,
as
defined
by
the
legislature,
must
be
submitted
to
the
jury.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
well,
i
think
not,
because
what
the
court
has
said...
and
the
case
i
would
point
you
to
in
response
to,
i
believe
it
was
your
first
question
of
the
afternoon,
is
perhaps
patterson
v.
new
york,
which
does
talk
in
these
terms.
it
was
talking
about
a
background
where
the
argument
had
been
made
much
like
the
argument
here,
that
anything
that...
any
factor
that
we
know
is
going
to
substantially
increase
the
sentence
must
be
an
element,
or
must
be
proved
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
and
the
court
says
no,
the
state
here
has
defined
these
to
be
the
elements
of
murder,
i
think
it
was,
and
that
is
all
that
has
to
be
proved
to
the
jury
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
and
that
is
our
working
definition
is,
what
the
legislature
defines
as
an
element
of
the
offense
necessary
to
conviction
is
an
element.
now,
the
court
has
reserved
whether
there
are
situations
in
which
the
legislature
might
go
so
far,
either
in
attempting
to
presume
guilt
of
an
element
or
in
attempting
to
design
a
system--
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
--in
the
first
instance
you
know
it
by
looking
at
the
statute
and
seeing
what
congress
or
the
state
legislature
has
defined
as
an
element,
and
in
congress'
case
that's
particularly
true,
because
of
course
there's
no
common
law
background
to
fall
back
on.
we
have
only
the
statutory--
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
--well,
it
is
done
against
a
long
practice,
so
i
think
what
you
have
in
the
elements
of
offense
is
something
like
you
have
here.
you
have
a
statute
that
says,
whoever.
it
lists
certain
actions
or,
and
usually
a
state
of
mind,
then
it
says
shall,
and
gives
you
a
set
of
punishments.
i
think
that's
a
very
good
indication
that
what
comes
in
between
the
whoever
and
the
shall
is
an
element
that
has
to
be
proved
to
the
jury
in
order
to
establish
guilt
of
the
crime.
our
submission
on
that
fundamentally
is,
it
is
whatever...
the
elements
of
a
crime
are
what
the
legislature
says
they
are,
subject
to
some--
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
--well,
i
think
there
has
been
something
of
a
paradigm
shift
over
the
last
40
years
if
you
want
to
look
at
the
way
statutes
have
developed,
and
i
think
we
think
slightly
differently
and
more
clearly
now
about
some
of
these
issues.
we
are
now--
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
--we're
working
on
that.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
we're
working
on
that.
what
you
have
now,
19...
2119
was
passed
in
1992,
well
into
the
guidelines
era,
so
it
seems
to
us
very
likely,
in
fact
it
seems
to
us
clear
that
congress
was
thinking
in
terms
of
elements
of
an
offense,
and
then
sentencing
factors,
jury,
judge.
the
analysis
was
somewhat
less
clear,
say,
40
or
50
years
ago,
and
i
think
when
you
look
at
something
like
the
bank
robbery
statute,
all
of
the
cases
under
those
statutes
have
always
proceeded
on
the
assumption
that
the
question
is,
lesser
included
offense,
greater
offense,
separate
offenses
in
the
double
jeopardy
sense,
or
one
offense
in
the
double
jeopardy
sense.
and
the
conclusion
there
has
been
that
congress,
when
they
set
out
three
separately
subdivided
offenses,
each
starting
with
the
whoever
language,
each
having
elements,
each
having
a
shall,
each
having
a
separate
penalty,
that
congress
intended
to
create
three
different
penalty...
three
different
substantive
offenses,
in
the
sense
that
we
are
now
talking
about,
and
we--
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
--i
think
it
might
be
written
differently,
that's
all,
or
we
would
have
a
different
indication.
if
it
were
written
the
way
it
is
written
now,
we
would
submit
it
should
still
be
interpreted
the
way
we
would
say
it
is.
there
are
three
separate
statutory
offenses
and
the
additional
elements
and
aggravated
offenses
under
the
bank
robbery
statute,
we've
never
argued
that
they
don't
have
to
be
proved
to
the
jury.
we
think
they
do.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
i--
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
--well,
i
can
appreciate
that
effort,
but
we
would
be
trying
to
come
up...
if
we
went
the
other
way,
if
we
went
back
to
a
mullaney
system,
then
it
seems
to
me
we
would
be
trying
to
come
up
in
a
long
series
of
cases
with
some
limits
on
this
theory
of,
well
then,
what
is
going
to
be
an
element?
what
increases
punishment
sufficiently
so
we're
now
going
to
call
it
an
element?
whereas,
it
is
not
only
consonant
with
tradition
but
much
simpler
and
clearer
to
say,
congress
defines
the
elements
of
the
offense,
there
are
certain,
perhaps
a
number
of
checks
on
that,
but
if
congress
has
defined
an
offense
and
then
provided
for
a
maximum
sentence,
as
in
this
case
of
life,
there's
nothing
wrong
with
it
then
saying,
here
are
some
intermediate
stopping
points
as
a
matter
of
sentencing,
and
we
are
directing
sentencing
judges,
in
applying
this
statute,
to
stop
at
those
points.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
well,
you
know,
there
are
always...
again,
there
are
other
constitutional
principles
that
may
supervene
here.
there
is
a
vagueness
principle,
which
has
usually
served
to
protect
us
from
crimes
that
either
don't
give
notice
of
what
they
prohibit,
or
are
invitations
to
arbitrary
enforcement.
so
if
i
understand
the
question,
that
it's
like
justice
scalia's
hypothetical
in
his
dissent
in
monge,
that
we're
talking
about
a...
it
is
unlawful
to
willfully
cause
injury,
knowingly
cause
injury
to
another,
and
everything
else
is
a
sentencing
factor,
it
seems
to
me
that
would
be
quite
vulnerable
to
challenge
on
vagueness
grounds.
it's
not,
it
seems
to
me,
very
vulnerable
to
challenge
on
the
ground
that
the
legislature
doesn't
have
the
right
to
make
knowingly
causing
injury
to
another
a
criminal
offense.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
well,
i
think
the
jury
trial
guarantee
is
a
central
guarantee
which
ensures
that
once
congress
has
defined
an
offense,
you
may
not
be
punished
for
that
offense
until
a
jury
of
your
peers
has
found
that
you
have
in
fact
engaged
in
conduct
which
satisfies
each
of
the
elements
of
that
offense.
i
know
that
may
not
be
satisfactory.
i
don't
know
any
other
way,
any
other
terminology
to--
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
--well,
that's
right,
and
that's
exactly
what
would
be
true...
i--
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
--hate
to
keep
coming
back
to
this,
but
it
is
exactly
what
would
be
true
if
congress
had
instead
given
less
guidance
in
the
statute,
and
had
simply
set
a
high
maximum,
which
would
have
been
perfectly
appropriate
for
a
very
serious,
violent
crime
like
this,
and
then
you'd
have
a
lot
of
guidelines,
mandatory
guidelines
under
the
sentencing
commission's
rules--
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
--well,
i
think
fair
notice...
fair
notice
of
what
you've
been
charged
with
and
what
the
government
has
to
prove
to
convict
you
is
certainly
mandated,
but
here
they--
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
--no,
nor
do
you
have
to
give
notice
of
any
other
sentencing
factor
in
any
normal
case.
i
mean,
if
you
have
a
kidnapping
statute,
and
the
range
on
the
statute
is
zero
to
life,
the
government
is
under
no
obligation
to
give
notice
about
particular
things
that
might
urge
the
judge
at
sentencing.
it's
never
been
part
of
our
traditions
that
that
is
a
right
that
you
can
invoke
at
the
indictment
stage,
so
i
don't
know
what
the
difference
is
here
simply
because
congress
has
made
certain
sentencing
factors
more
obvious
on
the
face
of
the
statute.
in
fact,
you've
given
more
notice
to
the
defendant,
because
the
defendant
was
there
at
the
crime
and
presumably
knows
whether
there
was
a
question
of
bodily
injury
or
death,
and
therefore
has
more
notice
on
the
face
of
the
statute
of
what
the
possible
intermediate
sentence
is.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
that's
absolutely
right,
and
there
was
no
question
here
of
any
lack
of
notice
at
any
stage
of
the--
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
--well,
at
sentencing--
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
--at
sentencing
the
whole
principle
is
that
you
know
in
advance
if...
under
the
current
system
you
actually
know
in
advance,
much
more
than
you
traditionally
did,
what
the
factors
that
are
relevant
are
going
to
be
and,
in
this
instance,
a
question
of
serious
bodily
injury
did
arise
between
indictment
and
the
sentencing,
and
the
defendant
had
notice
of
that
at
sentencing,
there
was
a
sentencing
proceeding
in
which
the
defendant
was
free
to
contest
that,
and
the
judge
made
a
finding.
so
in
terms
of
whether
there
has
been
due
process
here
in
any
normal
sense,
i
think
there
has
been.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
i
believe
that's
correct.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
that's
true,
and
i
misspoke.
there
was
that
notice
issue.
it
seems
to
me
that's
a
notice
issue
that
went
out
of
the
case
at
the
time
the
defendant
decided
to
go
to
trial.
if
there
had
been
a
guilty
plea,
for
instance,
based
in
important
part
on
that
misinformation,
that
would
have
been
a
good
ground,
perhaps,
for
vacating
the
plea
if
it
later
turned
out
to
have
been
wrong,
but
i
don't
know
under
what
principle
a
defendant
who
was
misinformed
at
the
arraignment
but
then
had
counsel
and
was
presumably
aware
of
the
contents
of
the
statute,
and
went
to
trial
and
got
a
jury
trial
on
all
the
elements
of
the
offense,
i
don't...
i
think
that
notice
issue
simply
washes
out
of
the
case.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
that's
right.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
correct.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
well,
the
court
has
given
a
variety
of
clues
along
the
way.
it
certainly
has
clearly
stated
that
a
state
or
a
legislature
cannot
define
something
as
an
element
of
the
offense
and
then
presume
that
it
exists.
if
you
are
going
to
define
something
as
an
element
of
the
offense,
then
you
have
to
send
it
to
the
jury.
that's
one
thing
the
court
has
said.
there
is
a
question
of
fundamental
fairness.
there
might
be
circumstances
under
which
fundamental
fairness
would
require,
says
the
court,
that
something
be
treated
as
an
element.
that
is
what
the
court
has
said,
and
i
cannot
give
you
a
good
answer
on
how
to
give
more
content
to
that,
except
that
we
will
probably
know
that
we
have
a
serious
issue
when
one
arises.
i
don't
think
that
any
such
issue
arises
under
this
statute,
because
here
we
have
a
very
serious,
very
violent
offense,
defined
in
wholly
conventional
terms.
if
you
look
at
this,
it
is
a
robbery
offense
all
the
way
up
until
the
word
shall.
there
is
nothing
unconventional
about
that
offense,
except
perhaps
that
congress
added
the
element
of
possessing
a
firearm,
which
is
an
additional
protection,
and
what
you
have
below
the
shall
are
extremely
conventional
sentencing
factors.
here's
a
basic
sentence
we
think
is
appropriate.
if,
however,
there's
victim
harm
that
rises
to
a
serious
bodily
injury,
then
it's
more
serious.
if
there's
victim
harm
that
goes
to
death,
it's
very
serious.
there's
nothing
in
that
whole
structure
that
we
think
remotely
challenges
whatever
constitutional
limits
there
may
be
on
how
congress
can
define
offenses,
and
that's,
i'm
afraid,
the
best
i
can
do
for
you.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
if
the
court
has
no
further
questions,
thank
you.
