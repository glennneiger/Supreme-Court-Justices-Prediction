justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
the
federal
sentencing
scheme
has
a
whole
array
of
factors
that
the
sentencer
takes
into
consideration
after
the
conviction
for
the
crime,
doesn't
it?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
quantity
of
drugs
being
one
of
them,
and
i
guess
if
we
were
to
adopt
your
position
that
would
be
unconstitutional.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
if
congress
has
spoken
to
the
issue,
then
we
have
to
treat
it
as
an
element
of
the
crime?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i'm
glad
you
brought
up
the
case,
because
i
would
have
thought
that
might
govern
the
resolution
of
this
case.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
so
has
injury
to
a
victim.
my
goodness,
talk
about
traditional.
i
was
a
trial
judge
at
one
time,
and
gee,
i
thought
presentence
reports
frequently
talked
about
the
extent
of
the
injury
to
the
victim--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--and
that
that
was
a
sentencing
factor,
very
traditionally.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
that
was
almendarez-torres.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
mean,
those
were
facts
that
were
not
proven
in
the
crime-in-chief,
and
it
increased
the
potential
maximum
sentence.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
neither
is
it
often
disputed
whether
the
victim
died
or
didn't
die.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
mean,
he
did
or
he
didn't.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
not
in
a
state,
for
example,
where
the
sentencing
is
done
by
the
judge,
not
the
jury.
it
is
typical
that
a
judge
is
going
to
be
considering
such
things
as
the
prior
bad
acts
of
the
defendant,
and
the
extent
of
injury
to
the
victim.
i
mean,
those
are
traditional.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
under
this
statute...
under
this
statute
if
serious
bodily
injury
results
then
the
defendant
will
be
sentenced
to
not
more
than
25
years.
it
doesn't
fix
it
at--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--it
just
exposes
him
to
a
broader
range
of
discretion
by
the
judge.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
the
same
thing
can
in
essence
be
true
of
a
judge
who
says,
well,
i'm
going
to
give
a
higher
sentence
because
i
happen
to
have
determined
on
a
preponderance
that
you've
been
previously
convicted,
or
because
the
victim
suffered
serious
injury,
or
because
there
was
a
very
large
quantity
of
drugs
involved
here.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
are
there
due
process
limits
at
all
on
what
congress
can
treat
as
a
sentencing
factor
as
opposed
to
an
element?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--how
does
this
statute--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
how
does
this
statute
require
it?
i'm
confused.
i
thought
it
just
said,
may
give
up
to
25
years.
