other
than
in
the
death
penalty
context,
are
you
aware
of
any
case
where
elements
of
the
crime
are
bifurcated,
and
where
the
constitution
requires
two
trials?
justice
john
paul
stevens
would
you
have
special
verdicts
in
this--
--they
used
to
do
it
with
some
regularity
with
respect
to
recidivism,
didn't
they?
justice
john
paul
stevens
would
you
have
special
verdicts
under
this
statute
under
your
reading?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
then
you
submit
alternate
counts
to
the
jury?
justice
john
paul
stevens
--all
you
have
to
do
is
say,
if
you
have
an
aggravating
circumstance
of
that
significance,
you
have
to
have
it
found
by
the
jury.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it's
a
very
simple
statute
to
write.
it's
a
question
of
whether
you
want
that
kind
of
a
statute
that
the
judge
has
a
rein
to
make
all
these
findings
that
normally
are
made
by
juries.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
and
you
can
commit
it
by
just
throwing
a
bucket
of
paint
on
a
wall.
that
would
do
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it's
really
an
eighth
amendment
issue,
i
guess.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask,
if
the
statute
said
it
may
increase...
now
it
says
if
the
judge
makes
such
finding.
if
some
third
party
suggests
that
this
person
may
have
done
this,
then
the
statute,
the
maximum
should
go
up.
i
mean,
you
don't
even
have
proof
beyond
a
reasonable...
by
a
preponderance,
but
just
a
suspicion
of...
would
that
be
constitutional
to
allow
that
to
increase
the
maximum?
would
that
raise
a
due
process
question?
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
judge
does
the
sentencing.
he
says,
if
someone
reports
to
the
judge
that
he
thinks
this
person
has
injured
someone
very
seriously,
the
maximum
may
be
increased
to
25...
a
certain
amount.
would
that
be
permissible?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
it's
not
an
indeterminate
system.
it
increases
the
maximum.
he
may
do
it
if
certain
facts
come
to
his
attention
by
an
ex
parte
submission,
or
something
like
that.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
think
the
standard
of
preponderance
of
evidence
is
mandated
by
the
due
process
clause?
in
other
words,
is...
they
now
require
the
judge
to
make
findings.
what
if
they
didn't
require
the
finding
and
just
said,
suspicion
is
enough?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
know
we
have...
what
do
you
think
about
that?
do
you
think
it
would
raise
a
due
process
concern?
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
difference
between
suspicion
and
preponderance
raises
concerns,
but
the
difference
between
preponderance
and
proof
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
does
not?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
see,
my
point
is
that
when
you
use
these
indeterminate
sentencing
examples
where
the
judge
had
total
discretion,
the
judge
then
could
act
on
ex
parte
submissions
that
were
purely
suspicion,
and
you're
saying
that
because
that
was
permissible
in
indeterminate
sentencing,
when
you
have
a
regular
system
with
statutorily
required
increases,
you
can
still
follow
the
same
basic
principle.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
seems
to
me
it
doesn't
follow
at
all.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
you're
opponent
is
arguing--
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
you
made
the
point,
and
your
opponent
made
the
same
point,
that
one
of
the
things
at
stake
here
is
the
notice.
your
notice
in
the
indictment
need
not
specify
that
which
will
subject
him
to
the
much
longer
penalty,
the
bodily
injury,
for
example.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
seems
to
me
that
you--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--but,
see,
there
are
three
things
at
issue.
there's
the
fair
notice
issue,
which
is
very
important,
there's
who
shall
make
the
decision
if
the
person
normally
wants
a
jury,
and
by
what
standard
of
proof,
and
in
your
view,
none
of
those
is
constitutionally
mandated.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
but
all
you
have
to
be...
you
don't
have
to
be...
give
notice
that
they
claim
you
caused
serious
bodily
harm.
you
don't
have
to
give
that
notice.
justice
john
paul
stevens
how
can
you
assume
the
defendant
always
knows
what
the
government
thinks
happened?
maybe
it
didn't
happen
the
way
the
government
thought
it
did.
maybe
there
wasn't
in
fact
serious
bodily
injury,
he
was
injured
by
somebody
else.
i
mean,
the
whole
system
is
that
you
give
the
defendant
notice
of
what
the
charges
are
so
he
can
decide
what
to
defend.
you're
saying
he
committed
the
crime,
therefore
he
knows
what
the
government's
going
to
charge.
justice
john
paul
stevens
that's
what
you
said.
justice
stevens
justice
thomas
has
an
opinion
to
announce.
