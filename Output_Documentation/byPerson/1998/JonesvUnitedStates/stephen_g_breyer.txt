justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it
has.
it's
been...
it
was
an
element
of
the
offense
in
the
possession
with...
you
know,
felon
in
possession.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
pretty
important.
sometimes
it
was
used
the
one
way,
sometimes
used
the
other
way,
felon
in
possession.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
mean,
i
think
you're
absolutely
right.
i
think
that
the
recidivism
is,
if
you
like,
the
extreme.
it's
at
the
extreme.
but
now
the
question
is,
all
right,
do
you
have
a
rule
that
just
governs
the
extreme,
or
is
it
a
rule
that
governs...
maybe
in
the
statutory
interpretation
this
is
a
fortiori
against
you
from
almendarez-torres,
that
if
you
reach
the
constitutional
question,
then
i
guess
you
have
to
say,
well,
is
it
an
extreme
that
only
recidivism
or
is
it
somewhat
less?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
which
is
asking
us
to
narrow
almendarez-torres
away
and
make
it
disappear.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
let
me
ask
you
the
question,
i
think
in
my
own
mind
only...
i'm
only
speaking
for
myself,
but
i
would
say
that
at
the
heart
of
this
was...
at
least
the
thought
in
my
own
mind
that
since,
let's
say
1,000
years...
that's
an
exaggeration...
a
couple
of
hundred
years,
we
have
statutes
that
define
crimes,
and
we
have
judges
that
assert
punishment
under
the
statute.
and
when
they
assert
punishment,
sometimes
it's
a
little
punishment
and
sometimes
a
bigger
punishment,
and
you
can
look
into
it
scientifically
with
the
aid
of
search
and
find
out
what
in
general
bigger
or
littler
turns
on,
and
when
we
find
that
out
we
find
certain
factors,
like
how
much
drug
there
was,
like
whether
a
person
was
hurt,
like
whether
there
was
a
recidivist,
and
that
turns
out
to
be
true
regardless
of
what
the
judge
says.
now,
suddenly,
if
you
decide
to
write
some
of
that
into
law,
either
in
the
form
of
statutory...
of
guidelines
or
statutes,
does
that
suddenly
become
unconstitutional,
the
effort
to
regularize
what
happened
in
the
past
by
saying
explicitly
that
those
factors
that
did,
in
fact,
govern
punishment
in
the
past
now
will
be
presumptively,
or
sometimes
in
statutes
more
than
presumptively,
grounds
for
increasing
or
diminishing
a
sentence?
what
is
it
about
that
effort
to
regularize
that
should
suddenly
constitutionalize
procedural
requirements
that
were
not
there
when
this
very
same
thing
went
on
under
the
cloak
of
darkness
because
the
judge
didn't
say
what
was
going
on?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
what
in
my
mind
is
lying
at
the
heart
of
this
and,
of
course,
my
answer
in
almendarez-torres
is,
except
in
extreme
cases
the
constitution
does
permit
congress
and
the
commission
to
regularize
what
previously
happened
silently,
or
without
understanding,
or...
et
cetera.
that,
to
be
honest,
was
what
my
thought
was.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
mean,
i've
never
heard
of
bifurcating
a
trial...
maybe
it
exists...
where
it's
an
element
of
the
offense,
the
injury.
i
mean--
well--
--you've
heard
of
that?
maybe...
all
right,
it
might
be
rare,
but
that--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--okay.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
prior
convictions,
yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--obviously,
if
this
is
an
element
of
the
offense,
i
don't
know
how
you'd
bifurcate
it,
but--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--maybe
you
would.
my
question,
which
is
related
to
that,
is,
imagine...
i
might
be
misremembering,
but
it
seems
in
my
youth
in
california
there
was
something
called
the
california
adult
authority,
and
it
was
fairly
common
to
write
a
criminal
statute
somewhat
analogous
to
the
one
we
have
here
that
would
have
said
the
following.
the
penalty
for
possessing
a
firearm,
blah,
blah,
blah...
you
know,
possessing
a
firearm
presence,
is
life,
period,
up
to
life,
and
then
it
would
be
up
to
some
prison
authorities
to
decide
whether
it
was
1
year,
5
years,
10
years...
does
that
ring
a
bell--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--that
there
were
systems
like
that?
okay.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now...
now...
an
indeterminate
sentencing.
now,
congress
in
its
wisdom
afterwards
thinks
that's
a
bad
system.
it's
too
subjective.
so
what
we
want
to
do
is
regularize
it.
now,
you've
said,
suppose
i'm
in
congress
trying
to
write
this.
i
think,
i
want
to
do
the
following.
i
want
to
put
the
person
away
for
life,
okay,
if
he
kills
somebody,
but
if
he
doesn't,
he
just
has
bodily
injury,
i
think
he
should
only
go
away
for
not
more
than
25
years,
and
if
he
doesn't
do
that
i
think
not
more
than
10.
now,
you've
suggested
there's
a
way
of
writing
that
statute
where
you
don't
have
to
prove
all
those
as
elements
of
the
offense,
although
here
you
think
you
do.
what's
that
way
of
getting
my
legislative
result
where
i
just
want
to
direct
the
sentencing
authority?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
how
would
i
write
that
statute,
in
your
opinion,
that
would
be
different
from
the
way
this
one
was
written?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'm...
but
what
i
didn't
get,
i'm
not
thinking
of
almendarez-torres.
i'm
not
thinking
of
any
case.
i
only
want
your
opinion.
i
am
a
legislator.
i
want
to
control
sentencing
by
statute,
as
i
just
said.
now,
how
do
i
write
that
statute
so
i'm
instructing
the
sentencer,
not
so
i'm
creating
three
new
offenses?
how,
in
your
opinion,
do
i
write
it?
you
know
how
i'd
write
it?
i'd
write
it
the
way
this
one's
written,
but
you
have
a
different
opinion
of
that,
and
so
i
want
to
know
how
to
do
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
that
an
open
question?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
mean,
it's
an
open
question
whether
this...
whether
you
have
to
have,
in
the
sentencing
factor,
a
preponderance,
clear
and
convincing,
beyond
reasonable
doubt.
this
court's
never
decided
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right,
and
so
is
that
a
matter
of
constitutional
law,
a
matter
of
guideline
law,
a
matter
of
the
statutes
under
the
guideline...
what
is
it
a
matter
of?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
ultimately
there's
no
notice.
i
mean,
notice
isn't
the
problem.
the
defendant
always
gets
notice
either
before
the
trial
or
before
the
sentencing.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
so
if
we
call
it
a
sentencing
factor,
the
defendant
gains
one
thing
and
loses
two.
he
gains
the
right
not
to
have
it
proved
in
the
middle
of
his
trial.
he
loses
the
ability
to
have
it...
the
right
to
have
it
proved
before
a
jury
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
i
think
that's
the
practicalities
of
it,
and
if
that's
so,
the
question
becomes,
does
congress
have
authority
to
pick
and
choose
which
things
it
wants
to
make
elements,
and
which
things
it
wants
to
make
sentencing
factors.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
everybody
seems
to
think
there's
some
limit
on
that,
and
i
take
it
you
don't
have
a
clear
idea
of
how
to
phrase
what
that
limit
is.
if
you
did,
that's
what
i'm
driving
towards.
