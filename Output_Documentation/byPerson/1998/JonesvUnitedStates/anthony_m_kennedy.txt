justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
has
the
term
elements
been
used
or
defined
by
this
court
in
a
decision,
or
a
series
of
decisions,
or
is
it...
is
the
term
we
get
from
the
common
law
which
is
a
summary
of
what
the
actus
reis
is?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
i
don't
recall
that
that
used
the
term
elements,
although
it
might
have.
it's
a
term
that's
been
around
since
the
ancient
common
law,
i
suppose.
i'm
just
not
sure
that
we
have
ever
used
it
as
the
pivotal
point
for
decisions
or
for
formulating
rules.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
in
that
sense
it's
almost
conclusory.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
so
is
your
position
that
any
time
a
judge
is
bound
to
make
a
particular
minimum
sentence,
that
the
constitution
requires
that
to
be
shown
as
an
element
of
the
crime?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
correct
me
if
i'm
wrong,
and
i
may
be
wrong.
i
thought
it
was
more
or
less
an
article
of
faith
for
the
criminal
defense
bar
that
they
want
general
verdicts
so
that
the
jury
can
consider
all
of
the
circumstances
of
the
crime
in
one
verdict
before
it
makes
its
conclusion.
now,
you
seem
to
be
going
contrary
to
that.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it
seems
to
me
necessarily
you're
going
to
want
special
verdicts
and/or
bifurcated
trials.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
can
you
tell
me,
what
is
your
formulation
for
what
must
be
submitted
to
the
jury
in
a
criminal
case?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
you
use
the
term
elements,
which
is
what
your
adversary
uses,
and
it's
just
a
question
of
our
parsing
the
meaning
of
the
term,
elements?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
how
do
i
know
what's
an
element
and
what
isn't
an
element?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
only
because
congress
has
never
used
the
term
element.
maybe
i'm
wrong.
maybe
it
has,
but--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
you
have
a
constitutional
right
to
a
jury
trial
to
be...
where
the
jury,
not
the
judge,
determines
if
a
person
is
a
bad
man,
but
if
the
question
is
whether
he's
a
very
bad
man,
that
goes
to
the
judge?
i
mean,
is
that
where
we
are?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--i
guess
we're
trying
to
ask
for
the
rationale
of
the
jury
trial
or
guarantee,
and
then
to
square
it
with
the
results
that
we're
asked
to
reach
here.
