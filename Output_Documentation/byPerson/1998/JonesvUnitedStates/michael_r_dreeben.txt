mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
will
begin
with
the
issue
of
whether
there
were
invalid
non-statutory
aggravating
factors--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--and
we
are
not
required
to,
justice
o'connor,
in
order
to
defend
the
judgment
below
on
a
ground
that
we
properly
raised.
it
is
true,
as
justice
stevens
pointed
out--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--that's
correct.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
that
was
the
question
that
petitioner
presented
in
this
case
in
attacking
the
ruling
of
the
court
below
that
there
were...
there
was
harmful
error
resulting
from
the
submission
of
these
non-statutory
factors.
we
argued
that
certiorari
was
not
warranted
to
review
that
claim.
in
briefing
the
issue
on
the
merits
in
this
court,
as
in
briefing
the
issue
on
the
merits
in
the
court
of
appeals,
we
developed
a
substantial
amount
of
argumentation
to
showing
that
these
factors
were
not
invalid
to
begin
with.
and
i
think
that,
although
the
court
has
discretion
not
to
reach
that
question,
it
should
reach
that
question
for
two
different
reasons.
first,
it
should
not
review
in
the
abstract
a
holding
that
certain
errors
occurred
and
whether
they
are
harmful.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
we
did
slightly
reword
them,
but
we--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--correct.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
i
think
that
that's
a
fair
reading
of
what
we
wrote
at
the
brief
in
opposition
stage.
the
question
now
for
the
court
on
the
merits
is
how
it
wants
to
resolve
the
harmless
error
holding
that
the
court
of
appeals
made
below.
it's
very
difficult
to
intelligently
consider
whether
the
court
of
appeals
got
that
issue
right
or
wrong
unless
you
have
an
idea
of
what,
if
anything,
is
wrong
with
these
factors
because
these
factors
address,
as
petitioner
has
conceded,
legitimate
areas
for
a
sentencing
jury
to
consider.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
justice
o'connor,
i'd
like
to
answer
that
question
on
two
levels.
first,
i'd
like
to
address
what
the
court
of
appeals
actually
did,
and
then
i'd
like
to
address
what
we
think
would
be
the
sounder
resolution
of
this
particular
issue.
the
court
of
appeals
gave
an
explanation
of
why
it
believed
that
the
submission
of
these
two
factors
was
harmless
error
by
adopting
a
methodology
that
says
we're
going
to
redact
the
factors
and
consider
whether,
with
the
valid
remaining
factors,
this
jury
would
have,
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
reached
the
same
result.
this
is
a
court
of
appeals
that
is
under
a
statutory
obligation
to
review
the
entire
record
in
the
case,
and
its
opinion
makes
clear
that
it
did
that
because
its
statement
of
the
facts
reviews
in
some
detail
the
procedural
history
of
the
case,
the
evidence
surrounding
the
crime,
the
mitigating
factors
that
the
jury
actually
found,
and
the
application
that
the
jury
reached
based
on
those
factors.
after
the
court
of
appeals
declared,
wrongly
in
our
view,
that
two
of
the
non-statutory
factors
were
invalid,
it
went
on
to
examine
then
whether
that
was
harmless.
it
recalled
in
its
opinion
that
there
were
mitigating
factors,
and
it
said
it
was
considering
those
mitigating
factors.
it
noted
that
the
government
had
placed
primary
stress
on
the
statutory
aggravating
factors
that
the
jury
found
and
that
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
invalidate,
and
it
said
that,
reviewing
that
material,
its
conclusion
was
that
the
error
in
this
case
was
harmless.
now,
this
court
has
reversed
several
state
court
determinations
of
harmless
error
upon
consideration
of
the
invalid
aggravating
factors
when
the
court
of
appeals
either
summarily
announced
with
nothing
more
that
it
found
the
error
to
be
harmless
or
when
the
court
of
appeals...
the
state
court
in
those
cases
did
not,
indeed,
make
clear
that
it
either
acknowledged
that
mitigating
evidence
existed
or
that
it
was
conducting
harmless
error
analysis.
those
things
are
clearly
inadequate.
what
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case
did
is
not
in
our
view
constitutionally
inadequate
under
the
standards
that
this
court
has
announced
in
its
review
of
state
court
decisions.
now,
if
one
steps
back
from
what
the
court
of
appeals
actually
did
and
asks
whether
these
factors
were
invalid
and
if
they
were
invalid
what
influence,
if
any,
did
that
have
on
the
jury,
i
think
it's
vital
to
understand
that
the
two
factors
in
question
related
to
evidence
that
was
properly
before
the
jury.
they
related
to
factors
that
the
jury
was
entitled
to
consider
as
petitioner
concedes,
and
the
error,
if
any,
in
them
is
in
loose
drafting.
the
first
factor
refers
to
the
victim's
young
age,
slight
stature,
background,
and
unfamiliarity
with
the
area.
and
these
were
things
that
the
prosecution
had
argued
to
the
jury
made
the
victim
more
vulnerable,
made
her
an
ideal
victim
for
petitioner,
and
thereby
exacerbated
the
culpability
of
the
crime.
and
if
the
factor
itself
didn't
spell
out
that
that
is
the
reason
why
it
was
an
aggravating
factor,
the
argument
to
the
jury,
which
we
have
reproduced
in
appendix
to
our
brief,
surely
made
that
clear.
now,
the
second
factor
that
petitioner
has
challenged
adverts
to
the
personal
characteristics
of
the
victim
and
the
effect
of
the
crime
on
her
family.
and
that
is
language
which
is
virtually
verbatim
out
of
this
court's
decision
in
payne
v.
tennessee,
which
makes
clear
that
the
specific
harm
that
a
crime
causes
is
a
cognizable
feature
of
the
sentencing
jury's
consideration.
now,
this
factor
too
could
have
been
made
more
explicit.
it
could
have
said,
indeed,
this
crime
caused
exceptional
harm
because
of
the
victim's
personal
characteristics
and
the
effect
of
the
crime
on
her
family,
but
the
argument
in
this
case,
which
was
very
briefly
devoted
to
this
point,
made
that
clear.
and
i--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--justice
ginsburg,
although
the
federal
jurisdiction
is
a
weighing
statute,
the
jury
in
this
case
was
specifically
given
an
instruction
that
it
is
not
simply
to
count
up
the
number
of
aggravating
factors
and
treat
the
numerical
significance
of
that
number
in
comparison
to
the
mitigating
factors.
it
is
a
qualitative
assessment,
and
the
judge
specifically
instructed
the
jury,
don't
simply
count.
now,
there
is
an
argument,
which
i
don't
agree
with,
but
there
is
an
argument
that
there
is
some
duplication
between
the
factor
of
personal
characteristics
and
background
and
the
other
things.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
they
are
personal
characteristics,
justice
ginsburg,
but
the
argument
made
clear
to
the
jury
that
those
were
personal
characteristics
relevant
to
the
culpability
of
this
defendant
in
this
particular
crime.
he
was
an
army
airborne
ranger
with
over
20
years
of
experience,
and
he
has
in
his
power
a
very
vulnerable
victim
who
was
very
inexperienced,
very
young,
very
small,
and
it
was
that...
that
vulnerability
to
the
crime
that
the
prosecution
argued
exacerbated
his
culpability
and
constituted
an
aggravating
factor.
now,
in
the
area
of
personal
characteristics
and
effect
of
the
offense
on
the
family,
the
evidence
was
brief,
but
it
made
clear
that
tracie
joy
mcbride
was
the
specific
person
who
she
was,
who
had
the
specific
life
that
she
had
until
it
was
taken
by
this
defendant,
and
there
was
an
effect
on
her
family
as
a
result
of
this
crime.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
congress
interpreted
this
court's
decision
in
payne
v.
tennessee
as
permitting
the
consideration
of
this
kind
of
victim
impact
evidence.
and
as
you
have
observed,
in
a
weighing
state
things
to
be
alleged
as
an
aggravating
factor
in
order
to
be
taken
into
account
by
the
jury.
surely
when
this
court
decided
payne
v.
tennessee,
it
did
not
think
that
the
victim
impact
evidence
and
the
evidence
of
the
effect
on
the
family
was
mitigating
to
the
defendant.
it
surely
must
have
understood
that
these
were
things
that,
when
the
jury
took
it
into
account,
may
well
tip
it
over
from
a
life
sentence
to
a
death
sentence.
and
congress
implemented
that
holding
by
providing
that
if
the
government
wishes
to
offer
victim
impact
evidence,
it
must
allege
it
as
a
nonstatutory
aggravating
factor,
give
the
defendant
notice,
and
put
it
forward.
and
i
think
that
although
it
could
have
been
made
more
explicit
in
the
aggravating
factor
itself,
it's
hard
to
understand
how
that
would
have
benefitted
petitioner
in
any
way
if
the
jury
were
told
you
may
find
that
this
crime
is
particularly
exacerbated
because
of
the
exceptional
harm
that
it
inflicted
in
taking
this
victim's
life
and
causing
these
effects
on
her
family.
as
it
is,
it
presents
to
the
jury
the
opportunity
of
taking
the
evidence,
which
it
heard
and
which
petitioner
concedes
that
it
legitimately
heard,
and
factoring
that
into
its
weighing
analysis
once
it
has
crossed
the
threshold
and
determined
that
this
defendant
is
eligible
for
a
capital
sentence
because
a
statutory
aggravating
factor
has
been
found.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
i
think
the
factors
would
be
better
phrased,
justice
souter,
if
they
were
phrased
as
you
described,
but
i
think
that
one
significant
point
on
which
i
would
disagree
with
your
formulation
is
that
the
fact
that
every
crime,
every
murder
has
a
victim,
and
every
family
of
a
murder
victim
suffers
harm
has
to
be
unique
or
exaggerated
in
some
way
beyond
the
norm
in
order
to
be
taken
into
account
is
not
consistent
with
this
court's
reading...
this
court's
reading
of
the
constitution
in
payne
v.
tennessee.
every--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--yes,
it
is.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
i
think
that
that's
absolutely
correct.
the
narrowing
that
this
court
has
required
to
occur
before
a
defendant
may
be
eligible
for
a
death
sentence
occurs
in
the
federal
system
when
the
jury
considers
the
statutory
aggravating
factor.
if
no
statutory
aggravating
factor
is
found,
that
defendant
is
not
eligible
for
a
death
sentence.
once
a
statutory
aggravating
factor
is
found,
the
jury
considers
all
of
the
mitigating
evidence
and
all
of
the
mitigating
factors
that
the
defendant
submits,
and
it
can
consider
all
of
the
circumstances
of
the
crime
formulated
as
aggravating
factors
by
the
prosecution
in
a
non-statutory
setting.
and
although
this
court
has
made
clear
that
even
at
the
selection
stage,
these
factors
have
to
be
specific
enough
so
that
they
are
not
basically
masks
for
the
consideration
of
arbitrary
or
invidious
or
capricious
things,
these
factors,
even
if
they
are
imperfect
in
their
formulation,
relate
to
legitimate
characteristics
that
the
sentencing
jury
may
consider
and,
taken
in
context
with
the
argument,
were
not
vague
as
to
this
jury.
the
jury
must
have
understood
that
it
was
her
vulnerability
that
was
being
targeted
in
the
first
factor
and
that
the
victim
impact
evidence
related
to
the
testimony
of
the
mother
that
the
jury
heard.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
the
victim
impact
evidence
i
think
is
probably
better
understood
as
something
other
than
purely
aggravating.
but
again,
when
the
prosecution
introduced
it
to
show
that
this
defendant
you
have
heard
has
a
very
particular
life
and
he
has
a
particular
set
of
experiences,
so
did
the
victim.
and
his
crime
caused
harm.
this
is
the
harm
that
it
caused.
those
things
are
not
going
to
be
taken
into
account
by
the
jury
generally
as
things
that
argue
in
favor
of
leniency.
they
will
balance
the
defendant's
mitigating
evidence
by
allowing
it
to
understand
this
crime
in
its
particular
detail,
and
that
is
what
the
court
seems
to
have
had
in
mind
in
payne
v.
tennessee.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
in
a
weighing
state,
the
jury's
deliberations
are
more
channeled
and
focused
by
the
necessity
for
finding
that
there
is
an
aggravating
factor
before
it
may
consider
it.
but
that,
if
anything,
would
seem
to
provide
more
protection
for
the
defendant
because
it
focuses
the
jury's
deliberations
on
what
the
prosecution
alleges
is
aggravating.
it
doesn't
detract
from
the
fact
that
the
jury
must
find
that
and
determine,
as
the
judge
instructed,
that
an
aggravating
factor
is
a
specified
fact
or
circumstances
which
might
indicate
or
tend
or
indicate
that
the
defendant
should
be
sentenced
to
death.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
the
court
has
made
clear
that
once
a
jurisdiction
engages
in
the
narrowing
that
is
required
under
the
post-furman
line
of
cases,
at
the
selection
stage,
he
decision
maker
can
be
given
as
much
information
as
the
jurisdiction
chooses
to
do
so,
and
as
to
mitigating
evidence,
it
must
be
given
the
opportunity
to
hear
all
that
the
defendant
chooses
to
put
before
it.
in
jurisdictions
like
georgia,
for
example,
once
the
eligibility
phase
has
been
crossed,
there
is
no
structured
weighing
and
the
jury
doesn't
have
to
enumerate
what
findings
it
makes.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
i
think
that
that's
correct,
justice
kennedy.
and
this
system
that
congress
has
devised
was
an
attempt
to
implement
in
a
fair
manner
this
court's
holdings
under
the
eighth
amendment
and
provide
a
structured
method
of
decision
making
that
would
permit
that
to
happen.
now--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--justice
ginsburg,
this
court
has
made
clear
that
a
reviewing
court
may
conduct
harmless
error
review
if
a
non-statutory...
if
an
aggravating
factor
that
is
improperly
defined
goes
to
the
jury.
it
has
not
elaborated
precisely
how
a
reviewing
court
goes
about
that
exercise.
what
a
reviewing
court
does
have
before
it
is
the
evidence
that
was
offered
to
the
jury
and
the
amount
of
time
that
the
parties
spent
on
that
evidence,
the
arguments
that
the
parties
made
to
the
jury--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case
chose
what
i
think
is
the
hardest
method
of
harmless
error
analysis.
it
chose
to
redact
the
factors
altogether
and
to
determine
whether
the
result
would
have
been
the
same
if
the
non-statutory
factors
had
never
been
submitted.
this
court
has
made
clear
in
clemons
v.
mississippi
that
there
is
an
alternative
method
of
harmless
error
analysis
which
asks
whether
it
would
have
made
a
difference
if
the
factors
had
been
constitutionally
defined
in
an
adequate
manner.
here
the
distance,
if
any,
between
a
constitutionally
adequate
aggravating
factor
and
the
imprecisely
formulated
aggravating
factor
that
was
submitted
is
not
great,
and
whatever
distance
there
is
was
crossed
by
the
argumentation
of
the
prosecution
explaining
exactly
what
was
meant
by
those
factors.
the
jury
furthermore
certified...
and
this
is
in
response
to
a
question
justice
stevens
asked
earlier...
that
it
did
not
take
into
account
the
race
or
gender
of
the
victim
or
of
the
defendant
in
formulating
its
verdict.
and
it
was
instructed
by
the
judge
that
it
may
not
take
those
things
into
account.
and
petitioner
concedes
that
no
evidence
in
this
case
reached
the
jury
that
the
jury
would
not
have
heard
absent
these
factors.
under
that
form
of
analysis,
i
think
the
court
can
be
confident
that
this
jury
verdict
would
not
have
been
different
if
the
factors
had
been
formulated
in
the
specific
manner
that
petitioner
now
appears
to
concede
would
have
been
appropriate.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
our
position
is
that
if
the
prosecution
requests
impaneling
of
a
second
sentencing
jury,
the
judge
should
do
that.
if
the
prosecution
concludes,
after
the
first
sentencing
hearing,
that
this
has
been
sufficient
to
us...
for
us
to
attempt
to
have
a
jury
reach
a
unanimous
determination
on
a
death
sentence,
then
the
prosecution
can
so
state,
and
the
sentencing
process
will
go
over
to
the
judge.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
correct.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
there's
nothing
explicit
in
the
statute
that
addresses
that
issue,
but
i
think
that
it
follows--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--justice
o'connor,
that
language,
as
petitioner
reads
it,
would
encompass
every
situation
in
which
the
jury
for
any
reason
did
not
recommend
life
or
death.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
and
it
would
thereby
totally
override
the
provision
that
allows
a
judge
to
impanel
a
new
sentencing
jury
when
he
has
cause
to
dismiss
the
prior
jury.
if
the
prior
jury
is--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--well,
it's
significantly
different
in
one
respect,
and
it
hasn't
been
interpreted
very
much.
there
is
no
actual
holding
in
which
a
jury
hung
and
the
government
sought
to
impanel
a
new
sentencing
jury
and
the
judge
said,
i'm
not
going
to
do
that.
there
is
dictum
in
a
couple
of
cases
that
are
cited
by
petitioner
in
which
those
court
said,
you
can't
impanel
a
new
jury.
the
significant
difference
between
the
drug
kingpin
statute
and
the
federal
death
penalty
act
is
that
the
drug
kingpin
statute
required
unanimity
for
a
death
sentence,
and
that
was
the
only
sentencing
recommendation
that
the
jury
was
given
to
make.
it
had
no
sentencing
authority
in
any
other
respect.
under
the
federal
death
penalty
act,
the
sentencing
jury
should
be
told,
when
these
options
are
available
under
substantive
law,
that
it
can
unanimously
recommend
a
capital
sentence,
it
can
unanimously
recommend
life
without
the
possibility
of
release,
or
it
can
unanimously
recommend
a
lesser
sentence.
and
congress
wished
to
get
unanimity
as
to
any
of
those
three
recommendations
by
so
emphasizing
that
the
role
of
the
jury
under
the
federal
death
penalty
act
is
not
simply
to
determine
up
or
down
whether
the
defendant
gets
a
capital
sentence,
but
to
reach
a
unanimous
verdict
as
to
what
sentence
he
should
get.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
you
would,
justice
breyer,
if
you
believed
all
of
those
things,
but
i
think
that
one
of
them
in
the
list
that
you...
that
you
mentioned
is
absolutely
inaccurate.
the
statute
does
not
say
that
if
there's
a
hung
jury,
the
judge
becomes
the
sentencer.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
that's
right.
if
it
had
used
explicit
language,
as
does
appear
in
the
committee
report,
that
says,
if
the
jury
hangs,
then
the
judge
becomes
the
sentencer,
we
would
not
be
here
arguing
today
that
the
statute
has
another
meaning.
this
is
what
the
states
that
have
provided
for
that
result
have
put
explicitly
in
their
statutes.
if
the
jury
is
unable
to
reach
a
unanimous
verdict,
then
the
judge
becomes
the
sentencer.
congress
did
not
do
that.
what
congress
did
was
adopt
a
statute
that
focuses
far
more
on
the
jury's
reaching
a
unanimous
verdict
as
to
any
of
its
three
sentencing
options.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
i
think,
justice
kennedy--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--well,
the
statute
seems
to
presuppose
that
the
prosecution
will
be
the
moving
party
in
seeking
a
death
sentence.
the
government
has
to
file
the
notice
the
triggers
the
process,
and
presumably
if
at
any
point
the
government
wishes
to
withdraw
the
notice,
that
is
the
end
of
the
capital
sentencing
process
under
that
statute.
so--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--well,
i
don't
think
it
does
make
any
sense
if
read
that
way,
and
we
don't
read
it
that
way.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
we
read
it
as
providing
for
a
separate
sentencing
jury
to
be
reimpaneled
and
to
allow
that
jury
to
attempt
to
reach
unanimity.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
if
that
one
doesn't
reach
unanimity,
then
the
judge
does
become
the
sentencer.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
no.
he
doesn't
have
to
because
the
section
3594
goes
on
to
say
that
notwithstanding
any
other
provision
of
law,
if
a
sentence
of
imprisonment
is
authorized
up
to
life,
he
can
make
the
sentence
life
without
the
possibility
of
release.
so,
he
can
go
all
the
way
up
to
the
top.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
he
can
give
life
and
he
can
make
it
without
the
possibility
of
release.
it's
contradictory
in
its
language
because
it
says
he
must
impose
a
lesser
sentence,
but
then
it
goes
on
to
make
clear
that
he
doesn't
really
have
to
impose
a
lesser
sentence.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
lesser
than
death.
that's
correct.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
the
judge
can
if
the
prosecution
decides
that
at
that
point--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--it
doesn't,
but
implicit
in
the
entire
scheme
is
that
there
is
prosecutorial
discretion
for
the
prosecutor
to
seek
the
death
penalty
or
not.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
you
could,
justice
breyer,
but
our
fundamental
point
here
is
that
it
would
not
entitle
petitioner
to
a
jury
instruction
to
that
effect
even
if
he
were
right--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--within
the
meaning
of
the
statute.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
most
fundamentally
because
it
is
information
that
is
an
open
invitation
to
any
individual
member
of
the
jury
to
hang
the
jury.
it
goes
far
beyond
simply
the
duty
to
deliberate
instruction,
which
this
jury
was
actually
given,
which
informed
each
individual
juror
that
he's
not
obligated
to
give
up--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--yes.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
this
court's
decision
in
california
v.
ramos
makes
clear
that
when
it
comes
to
providing
accurate
information
to
the
sentencing
jury,
states
have
a
substantial
amount
of
discretion--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--well,
that
is
true,
but
congress
is
quite
clear
when
it
requires
jury
instructions
as
to
particular
matters
to
go
to
juries.
in
this
very
statute,
congress
instructed
that
the
jury
shall
be
told
that
it
may
not
take
into
account
the
race
or
the
sex
of
the
victim.
it
has
no
information
in
it
that
says
that
the
jury
shall
be
told
about
the
effects
of
hung
juries,
which
is
a
topic
that's
not
even
addressed
in
the
statute.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
no,
justice
stevens,
we
don't,
and
i
have
to
be
brief
on
this.
but
the
jury
was
instructed
at
the
outset
of
the
weighing
instructions
that...
may
i
conclude?
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
that
the
jury
had
three
sentencing
options
and
that
it
had
to
be
unanimous
on
any
of
those
options.
and
the
succeeding
instructions
that
the
judge
gave
it
informed
the
jury
about
what
specific
consequences
ensued
from
any
of
its
recommendations.
there
is
nothing
in
the
instructions
that
says
this
is
what
will
happen
if
you
hang,
and
the
judge
made
it
clear
at
the
conclusion
of
this
instructions
that
that
was
a
possibility
by
telling
them
that
if
they
sent
a
note
out,
do
not
reveal
your
numerical
division
at
the
time.
