but
death,
it
would
be
appropriate
to
take
account
of
death
in
determining
whether
it's
a
sentencing
factor
or
an
element.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
for
purposes
of
interpreting
the
statute--
justice
antonin
scalia
--death
would
be
relevant.
justice
antonin
scalia
in
federal
statutes?
justice
antonin
scalia
talking
about
in
the
federal
criminal
code,
or--
justice
antonin
scalia
--that
congress
hadn't
done
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
denvir,
why
do
you
accept
justice
breyer's
hypothesis
that
this
has
been
uniformly
the
practice
in
the
past?
have
you
ever
heard
of
a
hanging
judge?
justice
antonin
scalia
which
was
a
judge
which
would
give
the
maximum.
if
you
came
up
before
him,
you
would
get
the
max,
period,
and
that
happened
sometimes,
didn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
when
you
committed
a
particular
crime,
you
knew
that
you
ran
a
risk
of
getting
the
max.
justice
antonin
scalia
absolutely,
depending
on
who...
what
judge
happened
to
get
your
case,
and
that's
not
the
case
under
these
statutes,
is
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
optional
for
those
judges,
isn't
it?
i
mean,
they
may,
and
may
perhaps
ordinarily
do,
impose
a
significantly
higher
penalty
because
of
bodily
injury,
but
they
don't
have
to,
do
they?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
they
can
still
impose
the
minimum.
justice
antonin
scalia
whereas
under
this
law
they
have
no
option.
they
are
bound
to
impose
the
greater
penalty,
aren't
they?
justice
antonin
scalia
that
would
be
okay?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
thought
your
answer
was
going
to
be
that
the
legislature
can't
do
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
legislature,
if
it
wants
to
leave
it
up
to
the
judges,
i
mean,
that's
the
price
of
having
indeterminate
sentences
and
allowing
somebody
to
be
sentenced
anywhere
from
1
year
to
life.
the
price
is,
you
have
to
leave
it
up
to
the
judge,
but
if
you
want
to
exercise
control
over
it,
i
thought
it
was
your
position,
you
have
to
make
it
an
element
of
the
crime.
justice
antonin
scalia
all
you
have
to
do--
justice
antonin
scalia
this
one
reads
pretty
much
like
that
to
me,
and
what
about
the
defacing
of
property
statute
that
your
colleague
suggested?
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
an
offense
of
defacing
property.
justice
antonin
scalia
if
nothing
else
happens,
punished
by
1
year.
if
there's
physical
injury,
30
years.
if
there's
a
death,
life,
and
whether
there's
physical
injury,
or
whether
there's
death,
is
taken
away
from
the
jury
and
your
right
to
jury
trial
does
not
exist
for
those.
is
that
a
problem?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
serious
you
get
1
year
for
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
unless
somebody
dies,
in
which
case
you
get
life,
and
you
don't
get
a
jury
trial
as
to
whether
anybody
has
died.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
wouldn't
necessarily
be
that.
it
would
depend
on
what
the
sentencing
authority
decided
to
do.
if
you
left
it
entirely
to
the
judge,
he
might
tack
on
10
years,
but
he
wouldn't
have
to.
if
you
leave
it
up
to
the
sentencing
commission,
they
might
tack
on
10
years,
but
they
don't
have
to.
there's
a
big
difference
between
congress
prescribing
that
you
must
do
it
this
way,
and
congress
taking
a
chance
that
somebody,
whether
it
be
the
individual
judge
or
the
sentencing
commission,
will
do
it
that
way.
isn't
that
the
difference
between
an
element
and
something
that
isn't
an
element?
justice
antonin
scalia
can
you
tell
us--
--there's
a
world
of
difference
between--
--can
you
tell
us
what
congress...
go
ahead.
--world
of
difference
between
letting
somebody
else
do
something
and
requiring
that
somebody
else
do
something.
the
latter
is
lawmaking,
and
that's
prescribing
the
elements
of
the
crime.
i
mean,
at
least
that
that--
justice
antonin
scalia
--that
is
open
to
discussion
that
that's
prescribing
the
elements
of
the
crime,
but
where
you
just
leave
it
to
the
judge
you
have
no
control
over
it,
or
the
sentencing.
justice
antonin
scalia
no
jury
trial
now,
right--
justice
antonin
scalia
--as
opposed
to
40
years
ago?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
dumont,
i
assume
if
you
have
a...
you
know,
a
crime
that
has
a
10-year
penalty,
10
years
in
prison,
now,
that's
serious
enough
that
you
need
a
jury
trial,
i
assume.
that's
all
it
says,
just,
you
know,
burglary,
10
years.
but
if
you
define
a
crime
as
defacing
a
religious
building,
or
something
like
that,
and
provide
10
years
for
that,
and
then
20
years,
another
10
years
for
some
other
sentencing
factor
that's
put
into
that,
you
don't
need
a
jury,
and
maybe
even
20
years.
that's
not
disproportionate
yet,
is
it?
i
don't
know
at
what
point
you
say
it
becomes
disproportionate.
is
increasing
it
from
10
to
20
disproportionate
yet?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
don't
know.
and
then
from
20
to
30
for
some
other
sentencing
factor.
why
would
the
people
who
cared
so
much
about
the
right
to
trial
by
jury,
why
would
they
think
it
unimportant
that
in
the
one
context
you
should
have
a
jury
determine
that
you
deserve
that
10
years,
but
so
long
as
congress
phrases
it
as
a
sentencing
factor,
we
don't
care
about
a
jury?
i
mean,
i'm
trying
to
come
up
with
some
interpretation
of
the
jury
guarantee
that
makes
sense,
and
that
doesn't
make
any
sense
to
me.
