versus
united
states,
no.
97-9361.
this
case
comes
to
us
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit.
petitioner
was
sentenced
to
death
for
committing
a
kidnapping
that
resulted
in
the
death
of
the
victim.
this
sentence
was
imposed
under
the
federal
death
penalty
act
of
1994.
the
district
court
for
the
northern
district
of
texas
imposed
sentence
in
accordance
with
the
juries
recommendation
and
the
fifth
circuit
affirmed.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
we
affirm.
we
are
presented
with
three
questions:
whether
petitioner
was
entitled
to
an
instruction
as
to
the
effect
of
jury
deadlocked;
whether
there
is
a
reasonable
likelihood
that
the
jury
was
led
to
believe
that
petitioner
would
receive
a
court
impose
sentence
less
than
life
imprisonment,
in
the
event
that
they
could
not
reach
unanimous
sentence
recommendation;
and
whether
the
submission
to
the
jury
of
two
allegedly
vague,
duplicative
and
overbroad
non-statutory
aggravating
factors
was
harmless
error?
as
for
the
first
question,
we
conclude
that
petitioner
was
not
entitled
to
an
instruction
as
to
the
consequence
of
jury
deadkick,
neither
the
death
penalty
act
nor
the
eighth
amendment
of
the
constitution
requires
such
an
instruction
be
given.
such
an
instruction
concerns
a
purely
procedural
matter
and
also
would
tend
to
encourage
the
jury
to
disregard
its
responsibility
to
reach
agreement.
we
also
are
of
the
view
that
there
was
no
reasonable
likelihood
that
the
jury
was
led
by
the
instructions
and
decision
forms
to
believe
that
petitioner
would
receive
a
court
imposed
sentence
less
than
life-imprisonment
in
the
event
that
they
could
not
reach
a
unanimous
sentence
recommendation.
the
scope
of
our
review
in
this
case
is
shaped
by
the
fact
that
petitioner
did
not
raise
the
objections
to
the
district
court's
instructions
and
decisions
form
that
he
now
impresses.
in
such
circumstances,
we
review
for
plain
error.
even
assuming
arguendo
that
there
was
a
reasonable
likelihood
of
jury
confusion
and
that
error
thus
occurred
petitioners
cannot
show
that
the
error
affected
his
substantial
rights
as
plain
error
review
requires.
finally,
assuming
arguendo
again
that
there
was
error
in
the
non-statutory
aggravating
factors
considered
by
the
jury,
the
error
rests
in
loose
drafting
and
it
is
claimed
that
the
error
was
harmless.
the
government's
argument
that
the
jury
cured
the
non-statutory
aggravating
factors
of
any
infirmity
as
written,
we
are
satisfied
that
the
jury
in
this
case
actually
understood
that
each
non-statutory
factor
was
designed
to
put
before
it
and
therefore
have
no
doubt
that
the
jury
would
have
reached
the
same
conclusion
that
had
factors
been
more
precisely
defined
in
writing.
the
chief
justice,
justice
o'connor
and
justice
kennedy
joined
the
opinion
in
full;
justice
scalia
joins
all
of
the
opinion
but
part
iii-a,
where
we
concluded
there
was
no
error
at
all
in
the
submission
of
the
non-statutory
aggravating
factors
of
the
jury.
justice
ginsburg
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion,
in
which
justice
stevens
and
justice
souter
have
joined
and
in
which
justice
breyer
has
joined
in
part.
