justice
david
h.
souter
this
case
comes
to
us
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit.
in
1992
the
petitioner
jones
was
indicted
under
the
federal
carjacking
statute
18
u.s.
code
2119.
at
that
time
the
statute,
which
includes
three
numbered
subsections,
provided
in
the
first
subsection
that
whoever
possessing
a
firearm
takes
a
motor
vehicle
from
the
person
or
presence
of
another
by
force
and
violence
or
by
intimidation,
shall
be
imprisoned
not
more
than
15
years.
in
the
second
and
third
subsections,
the
statute
increased
the
possible
penalties
to
25
years
in
prison
if
a
victim
suffered
seriously
bodily
injury
and
life
imprisoned,
if
a
victim
die.
petitioner’s
indictment
made
no
mention
of
the
subsections
providing
hiding
penalties
and
that
his
arrangement
the
magistrate
judge
informed
petitioner
that
he
faced
the
maximum
sentence
of
15
years.
upon
conviction
however,
the
district
court
imposed
the
25
years
sentence
under
the
statute
second
subsection,
based
on
its
finding
by
preponderance
that
one
of
the
victims
had
suffered
serious
bodily
injury.
the
petitioner
challenged
that
finding
contending
that
serious
bodily
injury
was
an
element
of
the
offence
defined
in
part
by
the
second
subsection
of
2119,
the
subsection
referring
to
facts,
which
had
been
neither
pleaded
in
the
indictment
nor
proven
to
the
jury.
the
district
court
rejected
the
argument
finding
that
the
second
subsection
defined
a
sentencing
factor,
not
an
element
of
the
offence
and
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed.
in
an
opinion
filed
today
with
the
clerk
the
court
we
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
ninth
circuit
and
hold
that
the
federal
carjacking
statute
sets
out
three
separate
offences
by
the
specification
of
distinct
element,
each
of
which
must
be
charged
by
indictment,
proved
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
and
submitted
to
a
jury
for
its
verdict.
the
structure
and
wording
of
the
statute
admittedly
offer
mixed
clues
about
congress’
intent.
but
the
fact
that
the
carjacking
statute
was
modeled
on
several
other
federal
robbery
statutes
and
that
those
statutes
treat
serious
bodily
injury
or
similar
facts
about
violence
as
offence
elements
convinced
us
that
congress
intended
serious
bodily
injury
to
be
an
offence
element
in
the
carjacking
statute
as
well.
our
interpretation
is
also
informed
by
the
principle
that
when
a
statute
is
susceptible
more
than
one
plausible
interpretation.
we
should
avoid
the
reading
that
would
raise
serious
doubt
about
the
statutes
constitutionality.
the
government’s
treatment
of
the
statutes
numbered
subsections
as
sentencing
considerations
would
do
just
that
because
as
a
line
of
our
case
is
beginning
with
in
re
winship
more
than
a
quarter
centaury
ago
may
clear.
it
is
doubtful
whether
under
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fifth
amendment
and
the
notice
injury
trial
guarantees
of
the
sixth
amendment,
a
fact,
other
than
prior
convictions
that
raises
the
maximum
penalty
for
an
offence
maybe
exempted
from
the
requirements
of
indictment
submission
to
a
jury
and
proved
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
justice
stevens
and
justice
scalia
have
each
filed
concurring
opinions;
justice
kennedy
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
the
chief
justice
and
the
justices
o’connor
and
breyer
join.
