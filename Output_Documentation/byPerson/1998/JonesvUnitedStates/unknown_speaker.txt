unknown

the
honorable
court
is
now
adjourned
until
tomorrow
at
ten
o'clock.
unknown
speaker
were
the
objections
that...
the
instructions,
rather,
that
you're
talking
about
now,
mr.
crooks...
were
those
objected
to
by
the
respondent...
by
the
petitioner?
unknown
speaker
on
the
express
grounds
of
overlap
or
being
duplicative?
unknown
speaker
those
are
certainly
the
kinds
of
things
that
the
prosecution
could
argue
to
the
jury,
and
so
this
had
the
effect
of
focusing
the
jury's
attention
on
a
certain
area.
i
would...
i
would
think
they
would
be
too
imprecise
for
eligibility,
but...
but
this
is
the
second
stage,
selection.
unknown
speaker
does
the
government
concede
that
the
court
of
appeals
was
right
in
saying
those
two
factors
were
invalid?
unknown
speaker
it
doesn't
now,
but
it
did
in
its
brief
in
opposition
to
the
cert
petition,
didn't
it?
it
didn't
raise
any
question
about
the
aggravating
circumstances.
well,
that's
not
the
same
thing
as--
unknown
speaker
--yes.
so,
we...
we
take
the
case
on
the
assumption
that
they
were...
they
were
properly
found
to...
to...
to
have
been
erroneously
submitted
to
the
jury.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
well,
supposing
that
we...
we
don't
agree
with
the
fifth
circuit,
that
those...
those
factors
were
invalid,
are
you
prepared
to
argue
that
they
were?
unknown
speaker
but
if...
if...
if
you
can...
if
payne
says
you
can
put
in
victim
evidence,
in
a
sense
that's
true,
every
victim
is
going
to
have
some
sort
of
background,
but
isn't
that
exactly
what
payne
means?
unknown
speaker
it
would
seem
to
me
to
be
very
difficult
to
design
mitigating
factors
for
submission
to
the
jury
that
had
no
overlap.
unknown
speaker
are
you
suggesting
that
perhaps
the
statutory
aggravators
are
models
because
they
certainly
are
discrete,
the
statutory
aggravators?
unknown
speaker
the
statutory
aggravators
are
discrete,
one
from
another.
they're
not
overlapping
as
these
two.
so,
if
those
are
the
models
for
what
additional
aggravators
are,
models
of
the
extent
of
precision
and
clarity,
i
suppose
that
that
would
support
the
eleventh
circuit's
view.
fifth
circuit.
unknown
speaker
how
is
that?
that
is,
what
i'm
having
trouble
in
my
own
mind...
i
take
it
it's
constitutional.
it's
perfectly
okay
to
have
a
statutory
aggravator
as
heinous...
what
is
the
words,
you
know...
heinous,
cruel,
and
depraved,
which
is
a
little
vague,
but
i
see
the
point.
but
then
why
can't
it
be
a
statutory
factor
where
you'd
think
of
whether
the...
the
victim
is
vulnerable?
and
here
what
makes
her
vulnerable
is
her
young
age
or...
you
know,
they
go
through.
they
say
young
age,
slight
stature,
her
background,
and
unfamiliarity
with
the
region.
that
seems
more
precise,
not
less
precise.
i
mean,
i...
i'm
not
taking
a
view
one
way
or
the
other,
but
i'd
like...
just
looking
at
it
directly,
i
read
those
three
words,
heinous,
depraved,
et
cetera,
and
then
i
compare
it
to
the
four
rather
precise
things
that
have
to
do
with
the
victim.
why
is
the...
what's
your
argument
that
that's
vaguer
rather
than
more
precise?
unknown
speaker
would
it
have
been
all
right,
in
your
opinion,
then
if
it
added
the
words
tracie
mcbride's
young
age,
slight
stature,
her
background,
and
her
unfamiliarity
with
san
angelo,
texas
made
her
more
vulnerable
and
therefore?
or
it
therefore
made
her
more
vulnerable,
then
it
would
have
been
okay?
unknown
speaker
mr.
crooks,
can
i
ask
just...
i'm
trying
to
clarify
my...
about
the
facts
here?
the
defendant
in
this
case
was
an
african
american?
unknown
speaker
and
the
victim?
unknown
speaker
and
did
this
aggravating
circumstance
sort
of
highlight
that
relationship,
that
contrast,
do
you
think?
unknown
speaker
the
vulnerability
point
and
the
young
white
girl
who
was
killed
by
this
black
defendant.
unknown
speaker
well,
correct
me
if...
if
i'm
wrong.
i
thought
the
law
specifically
required
the
jury
to
say
that...
that
the
race
of
the
victim
or
the
perpetrator
were
irrelevant
to
their
considerations.
am
i
wrong
about
that?
unknown
speaker
and
the
redrafting
that
you
said
could
have...
could
have
made
this
okay,
that...
would
that
any
less
have
pointed
out
the
fact
that
this
was
a
white
woman?
unknown
speaker
i
mean,
is
this
a
new
argument?
are
you
saying
that
this
is
invalid
because...
because
it
invited
the
jury
to
consider
race?
unknown
speaker
is
that
your
argument
here?
unknown
speaker
do
we
have
to
agree
with
you
in
order
to
find
for
you
on
this
point?
because
i
thought
one
of
your
arguments
was
that
regardless
of
how
ultimately
you
should
assess
these
particular
factors,
it
was
the
failure
of
the
circuit,
in
effect,
to...
to
discuss
the
issue
in
a...
in
a
comprehensive
way
to
flesh
out
its
analysis,
which...
which
made
its
treatment
as
a
matter
of
process
inadequate.
is
that
also
an
argument
of
yours?
unknown
speaker
well,
those
are
really
two
different
points.
i
think
justice
souter's
question
is
asking
you,
do
you
think
the
court
of
appeals
should
have
had
a
longer
part
of
its
opinion
dealing
with
this
part
of
its
analysis?
and
you're
saying
that
regardless
of
how
long
an
opinion
it
might
have
been,
it
could
not
have
rationally
reached
that
conclusion.
now,
on...
on
the
process
point,
do
you
think
that
the...
there's
a
certain
minimum
amount
of
space
that
a
court
ought
to
devote
to
a
harmless
error
analysis?
unknown
speaker
what
would
that
minimum
be?
unknown
speaker
well,
but
supposing
you
go
a
little
further
than
that
and
agree
that
you
can't
simply
say
we
find
the
error
is
harmless.
but
is
there
any
fixed
amount
of
greater
explanation
beyond
that
that
you
think
the
law
requires?
unknown
speaker
and
you...
what
opinion
is
it
of...
of
this
court
that
you
say
supports
that?
unknown
speaker
what...
what
does
this...
i
mean,
is
this
some
special
rule
for...
for
mitigating
and
aggravating
factors?
i
mean,
appellate
courts
often
just
reject
an
argument
saying,
you
know,
we
have
considered
this
argument
and
find
it
insubstantial.
period.
that...
that
is
not
enough?
unknown
speaker
why?
what...
what
special
rule
governs
this
context?
unknown
speaker
so,
the
court
could
say,
we...
you
know,
we
have
considered...
and
i
think
it's
clear
from
this
opinion
that
the
court
considered...
aggravating
and
mitigating
factors
and
found
that...
that
the
determination
the
jury
made
was...
was
okay.
does
it
have
to
say
anything
more
than
that?
unknown
speaker
why?
where
do
you
get
that
from,
it
has
to
discuss
the
evidence?
unknown
speaker
what's
the
best
court
opinion
that
supports
the
statement
you
just
made?
unknown
speaker
mr.
crooks,
do
i
understand
that
your
principal
argument,
however,
is
that
an
aggravator
of
personal
characteristics,
effect
on
family
is
too
vague
and
it
fits
every
case,
rather
than
this
process
argument
that
you're
now
making?
in
other
words,
are
any
number
of
words...
any
number
of
words
could
satisfy
your
objection
that
personal
characteristics,
effect
on
family
wouldn't...
wouldn't
pass
muster.
unknown
speaker
mr.
crooks,
our
own
questions
have
kept
you
on
this
point,
but
are
you
going
to
go
to
the
instructions?
unknown
speaker
let
me,
if
i
may.
i
have
a
question
that
i
want
to
ask
you
and
maybe
that
can
get
the
ball
rolling.
on
page
29
of
the
government's
brief,
the
government
quotes
section
3593(b)(2),
and
the
portion
that
the
government
quotes
is
this.
it...
the
lead
in
is
that
the...
the
court
may
impanel
a
second
sentencing
jury.
and
the
particular
text
that
refers
to
the...
the
further
sentencing
hearing
points
out
that
it
may
be
conducted,
quote,
before
a
jury
impaneled
for
the
purpose
of
the
hearing
if
the
jury
that
determined
the
defendant's
guilt
was
discharged
for
good
cause.
and
that's
the
end
of
the
quote.
do
you
take
the
position
that
the
inability
of
the
jury
to
disagree...
to
agree,
rather,
unanimously
on
a
penalty
would
be
good
cause
for
discharging
that
jury
after
it
had
had
an
opportunity
to
consider
sentence?
in
other
words,
can
you
have
a
hung...
is
it
proper
for
the
court,
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute,
to
discharge
a
jury
which
hangs
up
on...
on
sentence?
unknown
speaker
well,
why...
and
i
presume
that's
because
that
reason
does
not
amount
to
good
cause
within
the
statute.
is
that
your
argument?
unknown
speaker
i...
i
don't
want
to
cut
off
that
argument,
but
i
want
to
stick
to
my
point
for
a
minute.
do
you
take
the
position
that
the
inability
of
the
trial
jury
to
agree
unanimously
on
a
sentencing
recommendation
is
good
cause
or
is
not
good
cause
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute
for
discharging
it--
unknown
speaker
--and
why
not?
unknown
speaker
well,
but
that
can
also
be
read,
it
seems
to
me,
consistently
with
the
text
of
this
provision
because
this
provision
refers
to
the...
the
court's
capacity
to
impanel
a
successive
jury
by...
by
using
the...
the
permissive
term
that
he...
he
may
impanel
one.
and
so,
i
suppose
you
could
read
the
two
statutes
together
by...
by
saying
that
if
the...
if
the
judge
chooses
to
do
so,
the
judge
may
impanel
a...
a
further
sentencing
jury
and
may
submit
the
sentencing
question
to
them.
if
the
judge
does
not
choose
to
do
so,
then
the
judge
is
in
a...
in
a
position
to
make
the
determination
by
default.
why
can't
you
read
the
statutes
together
in
that
fashion?
unknown
speaker
well,
it...
it...
i
agree
with
you
part
way.
i...
i
guess
it
can
properly
be
read
to...
to
refer
to
a
case
in
which
it
simply
proves
impossible
to
get
a
jury
that
can
agree
on
sentencing.
i
think
i
would
agree
with
you.
let's
say
if
the...
if
the
judge
had...
had
impaneled
two
further
sentencing
juries,
had
discharged
the
trial
jury,
and
then
had
discharged
the
second
sentencing
jury,
and
had
put
on
a
third,
and
it
couldn't
agree.
at
some
point
you
got
to
stop.
but
i'm
not
sure
that...
that
the
otherwise
has
to
be
read
in
such
a
way
as
to
exclude
the
possibility
of
impaneling,
let's
say,
at
least
one
further
sentencing
jury.
unknown
speaker
did
the
other
statute
have
a
provision
in
it
which
on
its
face
seems
to
permit
the
impaneling
of
a
successive
sentencing
jury
as
this
statute
does?
unknown
speaker
can
i
ask
you
a
question
on...
on
this
part
of
your
argument?
imagine
that
you're
right,
and
i
think
you
may
be
right
on...
on
the
interpretation
of
the...
a
statute,
you
know,
that
there
isn't
hung
juries,
et
cetera.
imagine
too
that
you
can
raise
this
because
of
the
fact
that
you
submitted
an
instruction.
it's
prejudicial
in
your
case
for
the
reasons
that
you
state,
but
would
you
state,
but
would
you
say
ordinarily,
if
we
followed
your
rule,
it
would
be
harmful
to
death
penalty
defendants
for
the
reason
that
most
statutes
will
permit
a
judge
to
sentence
to
less
than
life?
and
indeed,
to
require
the
jury
to
know
of
that
fact
is
more
likely
to
produce
deadlocks
and
bargaining
that
will
end
up
with
the
imposition
of
the
death
penalty
rather
than
the
jury
doesn't
know
it
and
finally
the
jury
gives
up
and
it
goes
to
the
judge.
in
other
words,
i'm
asking
you
to
think
in
your
mind
of
comparing
your
case,
which
i
know
you
have
to
argue
for,
with
the
impact
of
the
rule
for
which
you
argue.
unknown
speaker
well,
why
was
it...
why
was
it
prejudicial?
i
mean,
let's
assume
you
have
a
jury
deadlock
six
for...
six
for
death
and
six
for
life
imprisonment,
and
you
say
that
if
the
jurors
know
that
failure
to
agree
will
produce
a
sentence
that
is
lower
than
both,
okay,
it's
going
to...
going
to
hurt
your
client.
i
don't
know.
i...
i
would
think
that...
that
what
would
probably
happen
is
that
the
six
who
were
voting
for
the
death
penalty,
if
they
know
that
if
the
jury
is
deadlocked,
the
person
won't
even
be
put
to
prison
for
life...
he'll
get
something
less
than
life...
i
think
they're
more
likely
to
switch
from
the
death
penalty
to
life
than
the
life
people
are
likely
to
switch
to
the
death
penalty.
your
argument
is
that
this
will
induce
the
people
voting
for
life
imprisonment
to
switch
to
the
death
penalty.
it
seems
to
me
it's
more
likely
to
go
the
other
way,
that
the
sword
of
damocles,
that
unless
we
come
to
an
agreement,
he'll
get
less
than
life
is
more
likely
to
induce
the
people
who
would
like
the
death
penalty
to
vote
for
life.
unknown
speaker
you're...
you're
the
one
who
has
to
show
it
was
prejudicial.
the
burden
is
on
you
to
show
that
it
was
prejudicial.
and
i...
i
certainly
don't
know
which
way
it
cuts.
if
anything,
i'm
inclined
to
think
it
cuts
against
the
death
penalty,
not
in
favor
of
the
death
penalty.
i...
i
don't
know
why...
the
most
you
can
say
is
that
it's
a
game
of
chicken.
we
don't
know
which
way
it's
going
to
come
out.
unknown
speaker
but
you
haven't
said
it's
going
to
make
that
sentencing
decision
that
way.
you
just
say
you
don't
know.
unknown
speaker
but
that
sort
of
randomness
happens
in
all
sorts
of
jury
deliberations.
the...
you
know,
we
want
to
come
up
with
a
unanimous
jury
if
we
can.
some
people
have
to
give
in.
there's
nothing
wrong
with
that,
is
there?
unknown
speaker
very
well.
we'll
hear
from
you,
mr.
dreeben.
unknown
speaker
on
this
point,
the
government
did
not
file
a
cross
appeal
on
the
holding
below
that
two
of
the
non-statutory
aggravating
factors
were
invalid.
unknown
speaker
it
wasn't
mentioned
in
the--
unknown
speaker
--brief
in
response.
not
only
was
it
not
mentioned,
we
adopted
your
phrasing
of
the
question
we
granted
certiorari
to
decide,
which
is
whether
the
court
of
appeals
correctly
held
that
the
submission
of
invalid,
non-statutory
aggravating
factors
was
harmless
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
unknown
speaker
well,
but
didn't...
didn't
the
solicitor
general's
office
in
its
response
suggest
a
rewording
of
the
questions
on
certiorari?
unknown
speaker
and
the
court
adopted
it.
unknown
speaker
and
in
the
third
question,
the
question
is
whether
the
court
of
appeals
correctly
held
that
the
submission
of
invalid,
non-statutory
aggravating
factors
was
harmless
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
certainly
we
would
have
focused
our
attention
on
the
assumption
that
they
were
invalid
and
did
they
perform
the
right
harmless
error
analysis.
unknown
speaker
i
guess
if
you
take
it
on
the
assumption
that
there
were
two
invalids...
we
don't
deal
with
it,
we
just
assume
it...
was
their
analysis
adequate?
i
mean,
that's
what
basically
the
petitioner
is
arguing
based
on
clemons,
that
it
just
wasn't
a
sufficient
analysis.
unknown
speaker
mr.
dreeben,
this
is,
as
they
said,
a...
a
weighing
state.
even
if
you're
right
about
the
first
factor,
the
second
factor
it
seems...
personal
characteristics.
well,
what
else
is
young
age,
slight
stature?
it
seems
as
though
the
jury
is
given
the
chance
to
double
count,
one,
two,
three,
four,
or
one,
two
three.
that
might
make
a
difference.
unknown
speaker
well,
if
you
don't
agree
with
it,
explain
to
me
why
young
age,
slight
stature...
those
are
not
personal
characteristics.
unknown
speaker
but
the
problem
with
that
is
true
in
almost
every
case.
i
mean,
there
may
be
some
instances
of
an
orphan
without
relatives,
but
every
victim
is
going
to
have
a
family.
every
victim
is
going
to
have
a
personal
life.
and
so,
to
list
that
as
an
aggravator,
i
mean,
it
just
jumps
out
as
being
inappropriate.
unknown
speaker
but
isn't
it
the
case
that
in
order
to
be
an
aggravating
factor,
the...
the
evidence
with
respect
to
the
victim's
personal
characteristics
or
the
effect
of
the
family
or
whatever
has
got
to
show
that
there
was
something
unusually
bad,
unusually
harmful
in
this
case?
because
the
whole
point
of
the
exercise,
in
effect,
is...
is
to
determine
whether...
whether
in
the
final
analysis
the...
the
individual
should...
should
be
in
the
death
category
or
the
life
category.
so
that
in...
i
guess
what
i'm
getting
at
is
in
order
to
phrase
a
proper
aggravating
factor,
the
factor
has
got
to
be
phrased
in
a
way
not
merely
that
it
says,
look
to...
look
to
individual
characteristics
or
look
to
family
effect,
it
has
got
to
be
phrased
in
a
way
that
says,
look
to
what
is
unusually
vulnerable
about
this
victim
or
unusually
grievous
about
the
effect
on
the
family.
and
if
that
is
correct,
then...
then
these
factors
didn't
do
it.
unknown
speaker
it's
necessary
for
death
eligibility
certainly.
unknown
speaker
but
once
there's
death
eligibility,
in...
in
weighing
the
factors,
you
can
take
into
account
routine
factors,
as
well
as
extraordinary
ones,
i
assume.
unknown
speaker
it
is
sort
of
a
misnomer...
and
you
would
acknowledge
that...
to
call
them
aggravating.
unknown
speaker
but
there's
this
kind
of
a
converse
problem,
if
you
analyze
it
that
way,
and
i...
i
see
the
sense
of...
of
what
you're
saying.
and
the
converse
problem
is
that
when,
as
justice
scalia
pointed
out,
these
non-statutory
factors
are
really
not
aggravating
factors
in
the
sense
of
the
statutory
ones
that
go
to
eligibility.
if
you
continue
to
call
them
aggravating
factors,
you
are
really
putting
a
thumb
on
the
scale
because
aggravating
factor
in
the
paradigm
of
what
it...
of
what
goes
to
eligibility
is
a
factor
which
really
does
differentiate
this
defendant
from
other
defendants,
says
this
is
worse
than
other
cases.
and
if
you
go
on
calling
what
are
really
not
aggravating
factors
aggravating
factors,
you're
giving
an
extra
weight
to
those
findings
which
in
a
non-weighing
state
they
wouldn't
have.
unknown
speaker
i
guess
these
words
are
relevant,
that
anything
is
aggravating
which
tends
to
offset
a
mitigating
factor.
and
of
course,
many
of
the
mitigating
factors
are
not
distinctive
at
all.
you...
you
can
introduce
the...
the
life
history
of
this
defendant
just
to...
to
personalize
the
defendant.
you
can
introduce
whatever
you
like.
many
of
those
things
are
not
at
all
extraordinary
in
the
sense
that
they
set
him
apart
from
the...
the
vast
bulk
of
mankind.
unknown
speaker
and
i
suppose
the
alternative
would
have
been
for
congress
to
say
nothing
at
all
and
just
say
the
prosecution
can
argue
such
aggravating
circumstances
as
it
deems
appropriate,
and
then
there
would
be
no
notice,
no
way
to
focus
the
jury
at
all.
unknown
speaker
mr.
dreeben,
one
part
of
your
earlier
argument
that
went
by
quickly
was
we
know
that
the
jury
really
emphasized
the
other
factors.
how
do
we
know
that?
i
mean,
maybe
the
jury
said,
yes,
to
the
statutory
factors,
but
boy,
we're
giving
him
the
death
penalty
because
of
her
young
age,
whatever.
unknown
speaker
but
if
it's
harmless
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
it's
very
hard
to
say
we
can
make
this
assumption
and
that
assumption,
and
if
we
were
the
trier,
this
is
what
we
would
have
come
up
with.
we
have
to
say
that
this
jury,
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
would
have
come
out
the
same
way.
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
you--
--can
i
ask
you--
--a
question
on
the
hung
jury
that
i
wasn't
sure
of
the
government's
position
from
its
brief?
is
your
position
that
the...
the
judge
has
the
option
to
have
a
new
sentencing
jury,
or
that
when
the
jury
is
hung,
the
judge
must?
is
it
optional
for
each
particular
district
judge,
or
when
a
hung
jury
is
present,
it's
mandatory
to
have
a
second
jury?
unknown
speaker
so,
the
discretion
is
to
prosecutors,
not
to
judges.
unknown
speaker
where
does
that
come
from?
the...
the--
--i
don't
read
that.
unknown
speaker
well,
it
says,
otherwise,
and
otherwise
could...
it
says,
otherwise
the
judge
will
impose
the
sentence.
and
i
would
have
thought
that
could
encompass
hung
juries,
as
well
as
anything
else.
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
how
is
the
drug
kingpin
statute
interpreted?
it's
very...
it's
kind
of
the
same
language
and
scheme,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
but
that's
what
you're...
you're
reading
it,
that
they
say,
which...
one,
the
kingpin
statute
says,
if
you
have
a
hung
jury
on
the
sentencing,
judge,
you
sentence.
25
out
of
29
states
that
have...
say
if
there's
a
hung
jury
as...
as
to
punishment,
judge,
you
sentence.
the
house
report
says,
if
there's
a
hung
jury
as
to
punishment,
judge,
you
sentence.
the
next
paragraph
of
the
statute
says,
if
there's
a
hung
jury
as
to...
you
know,
judge,
you
sentence.
and
in
addition
to
that,
they
asked
the
judge
to
tell
the
jury
that.
the
judge
said,
no,
i
won't
tell
the
jury
that
and
then
tells
the
judge
some
things
that
suggest...
then
tells
the
jury
some
things
suggest
the
opposite.
all
right.
so,
unless
we
take
the
one
sentence
that
favors
you...
and
it
does...
which
is
somewhat
ambiguous
language
in
the
main
statute,
if
i
don't
agree
that
that's
enough
to
overcome
these
other
four
things,
then
i
have
to
reverse.
right?
unknown
speaker
no.
it
says,
otherwise
the
court
shall
impose
any
lesser
sentence
that
is
required
of
it.
unknown
speaker
but
what
it
didn't
put
in
was
what
happens
if
there
are
successive
hung
juries,
and
that's
where
you're
trying
to
split
the
difference.
and
i
don't
see
where
you
get
that
from
the
statute.
unknown
speaker
it
seems
to
me
that
the
easier
course
is
to
choose
between
having
the
judge
sentence
at
the
end
of
the
first
sentence,
or
having
the
juries
go
on
and
on
and
on
until
they're
unanimous.
under
the
statute,
it
seems
to
me
the
hardest
is
the
one
you're
suggesting,
that
the
judge
has
some...
some
sort
of
option.
that
makes
a
lot
of
sense,
but
it's
difficult
to
find
under
the
statute.
unknown
speaker
mr.
dreeben,
i...
i
really...
please
help
me
with
the
statute.
i,
honest
to
goodness,
don't
understand
how
it
makes
any
sense.
if
the
jury
is
split
over
whether
to
give
life
or
the
death
penalty,
then
the
judge
may
impose
something
that
is
less
than
either
of
those?
why
does
that
make
any
sense?
i...
i
don't
understand
that.
unknown
speaker
well,
how...
how
do
you
read
it?
unknown
speaker
but
if
that
one
doesn't
reach
unanimity.
unknown
speaker
and...
but
he
must
sentence
below
either
the
death
penalty
or...
or
life
imprisonment.
unknown
speaker
but
he
can't
give...
he
can't
give
life.
unknown
speaker
well,
lesser
than
death.
unknown
speaker
how
do
you
get
the
statute
so
that
the
second
time
the
jury
did
this,
the
judge
can
sentence,
but
the
first
time
that
the
jury
does
it,
the
judge
can't?
unknown
speaker
where
does
it
say
the
prosecution
has
the
choice?
unknown
speaker
well,
why...
rather
than
read
all
that
into
it,
why
don't
we
just
say,
let's
interpret
it
in
light
of
what
25
of
29
states
do
and
what
the
drug...
drug
kingpin
statute
does?
isn't
that
a
little
simpler?
unless
there's
some
reason
for
thinking
that
the
congress
wanted
to
do
something
different,
but
the
house
report
suggests
there
isn't.
unknown
speaker
why
not?
unknown
speaker
why
not?
that's...
why
not?
unknown
speaker
so,
i...
i
want
you
to...
is
there
any...
suppose
i
were
to
say,
look,
the
reason
we
want
to
tell
the
jury
this
is
because
it's
true,
because
that's
what
the
law
is,
therefore
tell
them.
now,
is
there
some
authority--
unknown
speaker
--and...
good.
that's
what?
unknown
speaker
yes.
this
isn't
a
state.
this
is
a
federal
statute,
and
we're
interpreting
the
statute,
not
the
constitution.
unknown
speaker
but,
mr.
dreeben,
in
this
case--
--let
me
ask
you
one
question
before
you...
before
you
sit
down
very
quickly.
do
you
agree
with
the
proposition
that
roman
numeral
i
of
their
brief...
that
there's
a
reasonable
likelihood
that
on
the
record
in
this
case
that
this
jury
thought
that
there
was
a
possibility
that
the
defendant
might
get
his
sentence
less
than
life
without
parole?
unknown
speaker
you
may
finish
your
answer,
yes.
unknown
speaker
you've
finished
your
answer
i
think.
thank
you,
mr.
dreeben.
mr.
crooks,
you
have
3
minutes
remaining.
unknown
speaker
well,
i--
--may
i
ask
you
a
question
about
the...
the
hung
jury
aspect
of
it?
suppose
this
judge
has...
had
told
the
jury
correctly
there
are
only
two
penalties
for
this
crime:
death,
life
without
release.
you
must
be
unanimous
for
either
of
them.
why
would
he
have
had
to
say
one
word
about
what
happens
if
the
jury
hung?
why
wouldn't
that
been...
have
been
a
totally
correct
and
complete
instruction?
there
are
two
and
only
two
sentences
for
this
crime.
for
you
to
impose
either
one,
you
must
be
unanimous.
unknown
speaker
if
he
said
there
are
only
two
sentences
possible
for
this
offense,
that's
a
truthful
statement
of
what
it
was
in
this
case.
unknown
speaker
i
understand
that,
but
my
question
is
in
terms
of
the
cure.
the
cure
doesn't...
in
cases
where
there
are
only
two
sentences,
doesn't
involve
telling
the
jury
hung
what
happens
if
they're
hung.
