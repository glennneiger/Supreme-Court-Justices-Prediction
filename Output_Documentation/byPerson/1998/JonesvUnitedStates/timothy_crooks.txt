mr.
timothy
crooks
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
arises
on
direct
review
of
the
first
federal
death
sentence
imposed
under
the
federal
death
penalty
act
of
1994.
of
critical
importance
in
this
case
is
the
fact
that
the
fdpa
is
a
weighing
statute
in
which
jurors
are
required
to
weigh
any
statutory
and
non-statutory
aggravating
factors
they
find
against
any
mitigating
factors.
in
this
case,
the
court
of
appeals
found
that
two
of
the
four
aggravating
factors
found
by
the
jury
were
constitutionally
invalid,
but
then
held
that
that
error
was
harmless
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
the
court
of
appeals
erred
in
concluding
that
this
error
was
harmless
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
because
if
the
two
invalid
aggravating
circumstances
are
removed
from
the
mix
altogether
in
this
weighing
jurisdiction,
this
record
simply
cannot
support
a
finding
of
harmless
error
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
there
are
several
reasons
why
this
is
so.
first
and
foremost,
there
was
an
unusually
powerful
case
in
mitigation
presented
here.
this
petitioner
had
a
stellar
military
record,
including
22
years
of
service
in
the
united
states
army
as
an
army
airborne
ranger.
he
served
in
two
foreign
conflicts
and
was
decorated
extensively.
furthermore,
jurors
in
this
case
found
that
this
petitioner,
unlike
many
or
most
capital
defendants,
had
no
significant
prior
criminal
record.
jurors
also
found
that
at
the
time
of
the
offense
the
petitioner
was
laboring
under
severe
mental
or
emotional
disturbance,
duress
and
stress,
and
impaired
capacity.
and
the
jurors
also
took
the
extraordinary
step
of
writing
in
as
a
mitigating
factor
the
name,
sandy
lane,
who
was
petitioner's
ex-wife,
thereby
indicating
they
believed
that
the
break-up
of
petitioner's
marriage
with
ms.
lane
was
in
some
degree
a
mitigating
factor
for
this
offense.
it
is
also
significant
to
look
at
the
aggravating
factors
in
this
case
which
the
jury
did
not
find.
the
jury
rejected
fully
three
of
the
seven
aggravating
factors
submitted
by
the
government.
the
jury
did
not
find
that
this
offense
was
committed
as
the
result
of
substantial
planning
and
premeditation.
the
jury
did
not
find
that
the
petitioner
had
created
a
grave
risk
of
death
to
someone
else
besides
the
victim,
and
significantly
the
jury
did
not
find
that
the
petitioner
would
be
a
future
danger.
mr.
timothy
crooks
yes,
they
were,
your
honor.
it
is
also
significant
to
look
at--
mr.
timothy
crooks
--i
don't
recall
whether
there
was
an
express
objection
at
trial
on
the
grounds
of
duplication,
but
definitely
there
was
an
objection
on
the
grounds
of
vagueness
and
overbreadth.
mr.
timothy
crooks
this
evidence
is,
indeed,
admissible,
your
honor,
as
the
court
pointed
out
in
payne,
but
the
problem
here
is
that
this
is
a
weighing
jurisdiction.
and
as
the
court
pointed
out
in
stringer,
it's
especially
important
that
aggravating
factors
in
a
weighing
jurisdiction
be
defined
with
some
degree
of
precision.
and
as
the
court
of
appeals
correctly
held,
these
factors
were
too
vague
and
overbroad
for
use
in
a
weighing
jurisdiction.
mr.
timothy
crooks
it
does
not,
your
honor.
mr.
timothy
crooks
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
timothy
crooks
that
is
certainly
our
position,
your
honor.
mr.
timothy
crooks
as
the
court
of
appeals
noted,
these
factors
failed
to
distinguish
this
homicide
from
any
other
because
every
victim
has
a
background
and
every
victim
has
personal
characteristics.
therefore,
by
submitting
these
factors
to
the
jury,
the
government
stacked
the
deck
because
the
jury
could
not
help
but
find
these
factors
as
they
were
worded,
and
once
the
jury
found
those
factors,
in
this
weighing
jurisdiction
it
was
required
to
weigh
those
factors
on
death's
side
of
the
scale.
as
the
court
of
appeals
also
noted,
the
mere
use
of
terms
like
background
and
personal
characteristics,
without
any
further
instruction,
which
there
was
not
in
this
case,
leave
the
jury
with
precisely
the
type
of
open-ended
discretion
this
court
condemned
in
furman
v.
georgia.
in
fact,
the
two
invalid
aggravating
circumstances
had
they
been
removed,
it
cannot
be
said
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
that
the
result
would
have
been
the
same
in
this
case.
mr.
timothy
crooks
we
are
prepared
to
argue
that
they
are
invalid,
your
honor.
the
fifth
circuit
did
correctly
hold
that
they
were
both
vague
and
overbroad
and
also
duplicative
because
these
factors
are
present
in
every
homicide.
mr.
timothy
crooks
payne
does
mean
that
the
jury
may
hear
about
evidence
of
the
victim's
characteristics
and
the
effect
on
the
survivors,
but
we're
not
arguing
that
payne
should
be
overruled.
what
we're
arguing
is
that
in
a
weighing
jurisdiction,
the
factors
must
be
defined
with
some
degree
of
precision
and
they
can't
be
vague
and
overbroad,
and
the
jury's
discretion
must
be
channeled
in
an
appropriate
way
for
a
weighing
jurisdiction.
mr.
timothy
crooks
i
don't
believe
that's
true,
your
honor.
i
think
that
the
government
could
and,
in
fact,
did
in
its
brief,
make
an
attempt
to
draft...
redraft
factors
3(b)
and
3(c)
in
a
fashion
that
would
not
be
vague,
overbroad,
or
duplicative,
but
the
very
extent
to
which
the
government
had
to
rewrite
those
factors
in
order
to
make
them
even
attempt
to
pass
constitutional
muster
highlights
the
problems
with
the
factors
which
were
actually
submitted
to
this
jury.
mr.
timothy
crooks
i'm
sorry,
your
honor.
mr.
timothy
crooks
that
would
be
correct,
your
honor.
the
statutory
aggravators
certainly
highlight
the
problem
that
are
present
in
these
non-statutory
gravators
because
the
statutory
aggravators
are
worded
a
good
bit
more
clearly
and
give
much
more
direction
to
the
jury
than
these
factors
3(b)
and
3(c)
that
the
government
drafted.
mr.
timothy
crooks
first,
your
honor,
i
think
it's
significant
that
the
statutory
aggravator,
heinous,
cruel,
and
depraved,
doesn't
just
stop
at
the
words
heinous,
cruel,
and
depraved,
but
goes
on
to
tie
that
definition
to
torture
and
makes
it
more
specific
than
just
the
words
heinous,
cruel,
and
depraved,
which
under
this
court's
decisions
in
godfrey
and
maynard
v.
cartwright
might,
indeed,
pose
a
problem.
but
what
was
problematic
with
the
non-statutory
aggravators
is
that
whether
or
not
it
might
have
been
permissible
to
tie
the
petitioner's
culpability
to
the
special
vulnerability
of
the
victim,
the
aggravators
as
submitted,
the
non-statutory
aggravators,
did
not
do
that.
they
simply
required
the
jury
to
find
her
age,
her
background,
her
slight
stature,
and
her
youth
and,
once
having
found
them,
to
treat
that
factor
as
aggravating,
making
the
petitioner
more
death-worthy.
as
written,
the
factor
didn't
require
the
jury
to
find
that
she
was
more
vulnerable
and
therefore
that
he
was
more
culpable.
mr.
timothy
crooks
that
might
indeed
pass
muster,
your
honor,
and
that
shows
the
very
probably
with
this
nonstatutory
aggravator,
is
the
extent
to
which
it
has
to
be
written
in
order
to
create
that
sort
of
nexus
between
the
particular
characteristic
and
the
petitioner's
culpability
and
death-worthiness.
mr.
timothy
crooks
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
timothy
crooks
was
white.
mr.
timothy
crooks
it
certainly
could
have
invited
the
victim
to
think...
or
invited
the
jury
to
think
about
the
respective
races.
mr.
timothy
crooks
and
especially
the
words
background
and
personal
characteristics
are
so
open-ended,
they
certainly
could
have
invited
consideration
of
things
like
race
or
other--
mr.
timothy
crooks
--no,
your
honor.
you're
correct
about
that,
but--
mr.
timothy
crooks
--it
would
not,
your
honor.
mr.
timothy
crooks
no,
your
honor.
mr.
timothy
crooks
no,
it's
not,
your
honor.
we
contend
that
these
non-statutory
aggravating
factors
are
invalid
because
they
were
overbroad
in
the
sense
that,
as
worded,
the
jury
could
not
help
but
find
them
because
those
factors
are
present
in
every
homicide,
and
thereby
the
government
stacked
the
deck
because
the
government
had
two
factors
the
jury
could
not
help
but
find,
and
then
the
jury
was
told
you
must
treat
these
as
aggravating
and
you
must
find
that
the
petitioner
is
more
death-worthy
as
a
result
of
these
non-statutory
aggravating
factors
by
definition.
mr.
timothy
crooks
that
is
an
argument,
your
honor,
and
we
do
contend
that
the
fifth
circuit
on
this
record
simply
could
not
have
found
that
the
error
in
the
submission
of
these
aggravators
was
harmless
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
mr.
timothy
crooks
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
timothy
crooks
at
a
minimum
there
should
be,
as
the
court
pointed
out
in
clemons,
a
detailed
explanation
based
on
the
record,
and
as
justice
o'connor
noted
in
her
concurrence
in
the
sochor
case,
there
should
be
a
principled
explanation
of
how
the
court
reached
the
conclusion
of
harmless
error
and
that
a
bald
assertion
of
harmlessness
cannot
substitute
for
that
sort
of
principled
explanation.
mr.
timothy
crooks
yes,
your
honor.
at
a
minimum,
the
court
should
discuss
the
evidence
underlying
the
aggravating
factors
and
particularly
the
mitigating
factors.
the
court--
mr.
timothy
crooks
--both
clemons
and
parker
v.
dugger
stress
the
importance
of
courts
in
conducting
harmless
error
analysis
in
discussing
the
mitigating
evidence
particularly.
mr.
timothy
crooks
in
this
context
it
is
not
enough,
your
honor.
mr.
timothy
crooks
the
special
rule
is
the
constitutional
requirement
of
individualized
sentencing
which
requires
a
new
comparison
of
the
aggravating
and
mitigating
factors
once--
mr.
timothy
crooks
--yes,
it
does,
your
honor.
it
should
discuss
the
evidence
which
underlies
the
aggravating
and
mitigating
factors.
mr.
timothy
crooks
because
otherwise
it's
impossible
to
know
whether
this
petitioner
or
any
other
defendant
who
has
been
the
subject
of
invalid
aggravating
circumstances
is,
indeed,
receiving
the
individualized--
mr.
timothy
crooks
--clemons
v.
mississippi
in
this
particular
context
is
the
best
opinion,
your
honor.
mr.
timothy
crooks
that's
correct,
your
honor.
and
we
do
argue
not
only
that
they
were
vague
and
overbroad,
but
also
that
a
court
conducting
harmless
error
analysis
simply
could
not
have
found
on
this
record
that
the
particular
error
was
harmless
in
this
case.
mr.
timothy
crooks
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
timothy
crooks
the
jury
would
have
to
be
discharged,
but
there
would
not
be
a
further
sentencing
proceeding
or
a
new
sentencing
proceeding
following
from
that.
mr.
timothy
crooks
our
argument
is
that
the
statute
must
be
read
as
a
whole,
and
looking
at
section
35--
mr.
timothy
crooks
--we
take
the
position
that
that
does
not
fall
within
the
discharge
for
good
cause
provision
your
honor
is
discussing.
mr.
timothy
crooks
because
the
situation
of
a
deadlock
on
a
penalty
recommendation
is
covered
more
specifically
in
section
3594
which
provides
that
in
the
case
of
the
jury's
failure
to
reach
agreement
on
the
penalty
recommendation,
the
court
shall
impose
any
lesser
sentence
which
is
authorized
by
law.
mr.
timothy
crooks
the
statutes
cannot
be
read
together
in
that
fashion
because
the
plain
meaning
of
the
term
otherwise
in
section
3594
encompasses
the
possibility
of
a
jury
that
is
deadlocked
between
particular
sentencing
recommendations,
and
that
sentence
clearly
provides
that
the
court
shall
impose
sentence.
mr.
timothy
crooks
in
that
regard,
it's
important
to
look
at
the
background
to
the
fdpa,
which
is
that
the
fdpa,
in
adopting
this
otherwise
language,
took
it
from
a
previous
federal
death
penalty
statute,
the
anti-drug
abuse
act
of
1988,
which
contained
an
identical
otherwise
sentence
and
a
penalty
provision
like
section
3594
which
the
courts
had
universally
interpreted
to
mean
that
if
the
jury
could
not
reach
unanimity
after
one
try,
then
there
would
be
a
default
court
sentencing.
and
it
must
be
assumed
that
congress,
in
adopting
the
identical
sort
of
otherwise
language,
intended
to
import
that
understanding
into
the
fdpa.
mr.
timothy
crooks
i
don't
know
that,
your
honor.
mr.
timothy
crooks
and
our
answer
would
have
to
be,
your
honor,
i
think
that
probably
full
disclosure
of
accurate
information
cannot
be
a
bad
thing
in
sentencing
hearings.
and
in
fact,
the
court
has
drawn
that
distinction
in
several
cases
between
the
giving
of
accurate
and
inaccurate
information.
but
in
this
case,
as
your
honor
pointed
out,
it
was
extremely
prejudicial
and,
in
fact,
was
likely
to
produce
the
sort
of
unreliability
that
the
eighth
amendment
forbids.
mr.
timothy
crooks
first,
your
honor,
as
was
pointed
out
in
the
plurality
opinion
in
simmons,
the
fact
is
that
juror
willingness
to
invoke...
to
vote
for
death
increases
as
the
possibility
of
a
less
than
life
sentence
also
increases.
but
even
if
it
could
go
both
ways,
imagine,
for
example,
the
scenario
your
honor
just
described
where
jurors
are
deadlocked,
six
for
life,
six
for
death,
but
no
one
wants
the
lesser
sentence.
what's
going
to
happen
is
if
there
are
people
who
are
just
adamant
about
death,
it's
going
to
just
turn
into
a
game
of
chicken
where
the
people
who
are
the
most
stubborn
are
going
to
be
the
ones
that
prevail.
and
it's
that
sort
of
randomness
that
this
court
has
said
cannot
be
tolerated
in
a
capital--
mr.
timothy
crooks
--and
that
is
sufficient
to
show
prejudice,
your
honor,
if
the
jury
is
going
to
make
a
sentencing
decision
based
on
erroneous
information.
mr.
timothy
crooks
if
there
are
jurors
who
are
deadlocked
between
death
and
life
but
no
one
wants
a
lesser
sentence,
their
belief
that
they
will
produce
a
lesser
sentence
if
they
don't
agree
is
going
to
drive
one
or
the
other
over
to
the
other
side.
and
it's
precisely
that
randomness
that
is
the
error.
mr.
timothy
crooks
there
is
a
lot
of
give
and
take
in
jury
deliberations,
your
honor,
but
that
give
and
take
should
not
be
based
on
erroneous
information.
if
i
could,
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
timothy
crooks
first,
i
would
like
to
return
to
justice
ginsburg's
question
about
the
question
of
harmlessness
in
this
particular
case.
this
was
an
extremely
close
and
difficult
decision
for
this
jury
because
they
took
a
day
and
a
half
to
reach
a
penalty
decision.
and
it's
also
significant
to
remember
that
if
even
one
juror
had
weighed
the
balance
between
aggravating
factors
and
mitigating
factors
differently,
no
death
sentence
would
have
resulted.
and
on
this
record
particularly,
it
simply
can't
be
said
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
that
the
error
was
harmless.
with
respect
to
the
validity
of
the
aggravating
factors
at
issue,
again
we
stress
that
we
do
not
dispute
the
admissibility
of
victim
characteristic
and
survivor
impact
evidence
in
capital
sentencing
hearings.
the
problem
here
is
the
use
in
this
weighing
jurisdiction
of
vague
and
overbroad
aggravating
factors.
and
as
the
factors
were
drafted
and
submitted
to
the
jury,
they
allowed
the
jury
to
consider
not
only
the
things
which
the
government
highlighted
in
its
argument,
but
many
other
impermissible
considerations
that
were
very
vaguely
and
broadly
worded.
and
the
jury,
because
this
was
a
weighing
jurisdiction,
once
having
found
them,
was
required
to
weigh
them
on
death's
side
of
the
scale.
mr.
timothy
crooks
even
that
instruction
might
still
invite
the
type
of
speculation
that
there
might
be
a
lesser
sentence,
but
what
happened
in
this
case
was--
mr.
timothy
crooks
--if
the
jury
were
told
that
those
were
the
only
two
possible
sentences,
that
might
have
obviated
the
prejudice
in
this
case.
but
the
instruction
which
was
proposed
by
the
defense
in
this
case
would
likewise
have
taken
care
of
the
problem
because
the
jury
would
have
been
told
that
no
lesser
sentence
would
result
unless
they
unanimously
voted
for
it
and
that
the
effect
of
a
deadlock
would
not
be
the
lesser
sentence
but
would
be
life
without
parole.
mr.
timothy
crooks
that
is
one
cure,
your
honor,
but
another
cure
where,
in
fact,
the
lesser
sentence
option
is,
albeit
erroneously
introduced,
is
also
to
tell
the
jury
that
it
will
not
be
the
result
of
a
deadlock.
