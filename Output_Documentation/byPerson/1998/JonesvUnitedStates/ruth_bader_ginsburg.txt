justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
dumont--
--well,
in
your--
--in
the
context
of
this
case,
let's
take
the
rivera
situation,
where
congress
said
to
the
first
circuit,
you
got
it
wrong,
and
rape
is
included
in
serious
bodily
injuries,
so
as
you
read
this
statute
carjacking,
and
there's
an
allegation
that
a
rape
took
place,
and
that's
disputed,
and
yet
the
person
could
be
tried
by
the
jury
for
the
carjacking
part,
the
judge
decides
whether
the
rape
occurred
or
not,
and
that
would
be...
that's
the
way
the
statute
would
work.
do
i
understand
you
correctly?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
you
would
have
by
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence
10
years
added
on
for
the
rape
by
the
judge.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--is
there
any
indication
that
congress
knew
when
it
was
drafting,
say,
the
robbery
statute
as
opposed
to
the
carjacking,
that
in
the
one
case
it
was
robbery,
the
serious
bodily
injury
would
go
to
the
jury,
and
the
other,
it
would
go
to
the
judge?
you
say
it's
a
matter
of
what
congress
intended.
i
read
your
brief
and
you
say,
well,
the
way
the
robbery
statute
is
written,
serious
bodily
injury
would
go
to
the
jury,
right,
but
the
way
the
carjacking
statute
is,
it
would
go
to
the
judge.
is
there
any
indication
that
congress...
it
seems
to
me
it
doesn't
make
a
whole
lot
of
sense
to
distinguish
those
two.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
there's
the
question
of
the
age
of
the
statute,
and
you're
saying,
maybe
if
the
bank
robbery
statute
were
passed
today
it
would
be
just
like
the
carjacking
statute.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
in
the
facts
of
this
very
case,
the
magistrate
judge
told
him
he
was
facing
15
years,
and
it
was
a
little
confused
because,
do
i
understand
correctly
he
was
not
the
one
who
actually
administered
the
blow,
it
was
his
codefendant?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
here
was
a
magistrate
judge
who
didn't
accurately
notify
the
defendant
of
what
he
faced.
the
magistrate
judge
says,
it's
15
years.
