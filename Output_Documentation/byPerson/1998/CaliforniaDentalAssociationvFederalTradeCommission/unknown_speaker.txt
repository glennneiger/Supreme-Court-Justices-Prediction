unknown
speaker
would
you
just
remind
me,
counsel?
was
the
organization
in
the
blood
bank
case...
was
that
a
501(c)(3)
or
(c)(6)?
unknown
speaker
do
you
recognize
that
there
might
be
some
501(c)(6)
organizations
that
would
fit
the
definition
of
carries
on
business
for
the
profit
of
its
members?
unknown
speaker
so,
you're
distinguishing
among
501(c)...
you're
not
saying
all
nonprofits
are
out.
unknown
speaker
and
so,
now
you're
going
to
tell
us
why,
say,
the
dental
association
is
different
from
the
real
estate
board.
unknown
speaker
well,
how
about
a
trade
organization
that's
there
to
promote,
say,
eggs?
it
wouldn't
fit
the
definition
of
profit
that
you
just
gave
us,
would
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
guess
there
are
some
benefits,
though,
for
the
dentists
to
belong
to
the
dental
association:
better
insurance
vehicles
and
other
benefits
that
the
organization
may
provide
to
its
members.
unknown
speaker
do
you
say
that
the
organization
provides
no
benefits
to
its
members?
unknown
speaker
wasn't
there
a
finding
someplace
that
the
value
of
the
membership
to
each
dentist
was
worth...
i
don't
know
20,000
dollars
or
something?
unknown
speaker
but
i
read
section
44
to
say
an
organization
which
is
organized
to
carry
on
business
for
its
own
profit
or
for
the
profit
of
its
members.
and...
and
in
some
sense
the
dental
association
does
exist
for
the
benefit
of
the
profit
of
its
members.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
no,
but
it
says,
or
the
profit
of
its
members.
it's
true
that
the
association
isn't
paying
out
money,
but
it
is
in
existence
to
help
its
dentists
make
money
and
profit
and
be
qualified
professionals
and...
and
succeed--
unknown
speaker
--in
the
business
of...
the
profession
of
dentistry.
unknown
speaker
well,
those
are
lower
court
cases,
and
i
don't
know
that
we've
decided
that.
so,
as
i
approached
this
initially,
i
would
have
thought
it
was
designed
to
distinguish
trade
associations
from
charities.
this
is...
yours
is
a
trade
association
and
the
blood
bank
is
a
charity.
unknown
speaker
but
i'm
not...
i'm
not
speaking
of
a
particular
case.
i
mean,
if
i
looked
at
this
and
said,
look,
it
tries
to
distinguish
trade
associations
from
charities,
why
am
i
wrong?
am
i
wrong?
and...
i...
granted,
there
are
some
tough
distinctions
somewhere
along
the
line,
but
this
wouldn't
be
one
of
them,
i
guess.
unknown
speaker
well,
let's
take
a
trade
organization
that
unquestionably
is
a
trade...
now,
maybe
milliners...
i
don't
know
what
it
would
be...
that
wants
to
improve
the
image
of
milliners
or
hatters
in
the
public
view.
it
doesn't
make
profit
in
the
sense
that
you
are
describing,
but
it
does
say,
for
example,
if
you
join
our
organization,
then
you
will
likely
have
6,000
dollars
in
additional
revenues,
in
other
words,
a
20
percent
return
on
the
investment
that
you've
made
in
paying
us
dues.
suppose
that
was
what
the
trade
association
said.
and
it
did
public
things
and
it
did
things
for
the...
for
the
prestige
of
hatters
and
also
was
designed
to
help
them
make
money.
would
you
say
that
the
ftc
had
no
authority
over
such
a
trade
organization?
unknown
speaker
but
that
wouldn't...
i
gave
you
something
that
deliberately
does
not
have
the
narrow
definition
of
profit
that
you
have
been
pressing.
unknown
speaker
it
doesn't
say,
and.
it
says,
business
for
profit.
unknown
speaker
business
for
the
profit.
unknown
speaker
i
don't
know.
were
organizations
like
the
cement
institute,
the
sugar
institute,
the
maple
flooring
association...
were
they
themselves
making
profit?
i
doubt
it.
i
had
always
thought
they
were
there
to
make
profit
for
their
members.
unknown
speaker
their
members
were.
unknown
speaker
all
right,
okay.
so...
so...
but
if
i--
unknown
speaker
--what
i'm
asking--
unknown
speaker
--well,
you'd
also
say
they
fall...
they
fall
in
a
different
category
if
the
dentists
agreed
on
a
recommended
fee
schedule
that
was
higher
than
the
market
would
otherwise
provide.
then
it
would
clearly
be
covered
because
that
would
be
for
the
profit
of
the
members.
i
mean,
a
lot
of
trade
associations
have
in
the
past
engaged
in
price
fixing.
raise
the
prices,
we
all
make
more
money.
and
if
that
were
alleged
by
your
association,
you
would
agree
that
it
would
be
covered.
unknown
speaker
maybe
if
just
one
of
the
subsidiary
purposes.
they
mainly
are
interested
in
ethics
of
the
industry
and
the
reputation
of
the
dentists,
but
incidentally,
we
also
get
the
price
level
up
about
10
percent
higher
than
otherwise
would
be.
unknown
speaker
if
that
were
the
case,
i
think
you'd
say
it
would
be
covered.
unknown
speaker
well,
except
on
that
point,
one
of
the
peculiar
interests
of
the
federal
trade
commission
is
advertising
practices.
and
so,
once...
insofar
as
you're
in
advertising,
you
seem
to
me
to
be
perhaps
more
in
the
realm
that
is
normally
an
ftc
area
of
jurisdiction
than
just
the
sherman
act.
unknown
speaker
are
you
going
to
answer
justice
stevens'
question?
besides
saying
that...
that
such
an
organization
for
that
price
fixing
would
be
subject
to
the
sherman
act,
will
you
answer
his
question
of
whether
the
federal
trade
commission
would
have
jurisdiction--
unknown
speaker
--the
very
simple
fact
that
the
trade
association,
as
some
in
our
sorry
history
of
antitrust
laws
have
in
the
past
done,
are
engaged
in
price
fixing.
they
raise
the
level
of
the...
the
fees
that
the
dentists
charge
generally
by
restricting
advertising,
recommending
fee
rates,
and
doing
a
lot
of
things
like
that,
which
i'm
not
suggesting
your
organization
does.
but
a
hypothetical
dental
association
doing
that,
would
it
be
covered?
unknown
speaker
subject
to
the
federal
trade
commission
act.
unknown
speaker
why
isn't
the
same
thing
true
when
one
of
its
objects
is...
is
to
make
insurance
cheaper?
that
increases
the
profit.
pay
less
for
insurance,
get
more
for
fees.
the
result
is
the
same
to
the
members.
unknown
speaker
well,
the...
the...
in
each
case,
the
profit
i
understand
is
to
be
defined
by
an
increase
in
what
the
dentists
have
at
the
end
of
the
day.
and
in
justice
stevens'
example,
they
get
the
increase
by
putting
the
fee
up.
in...
in
the
example,
i
think,
of
your
client,
they
get
it,
if
the
association
is
doing
its
work,
by
paying
less
for
overhead.
what's
the
difference?
unknown
speaker
but
i...
i
take
it
at
the
end
of...
at
the
end
of
the
day
here,
you're
saying
profit
is...
is
that
increase
in
income
which
results
from
raising
fees
but
not
from
lowering
overhead,
and
that
has...
that
is
of
jurisdictional
significance.
is
that
the
line
you
draw?
unknown
speaker
i
was
referring
to
my
hypothetical--
unknown
speaker
--in...
in
which
they...
they
don't
get
together
to
raise
the
fees.
they
get
together
to
lower
the
overhead,
in
this
particular
case,
by
negotiating
lower
insurance
rates
for
their
members.
at
the...
at
the...
at
the...
the
bottom
line,
as
people
like
to
say,
is
the
dentists
take
home
more
money.
in
justice
stevens'
example,
they
do
it
by
charging
more
for
the
filling.
in
my
example,
they
pay
less
for
the
insurance.
why
in
my
example
doesn't
the...
doesn't
the
profit
criterion
get
satisfied
as
well
as
in
his?
unknown
speaker
in
justice
stevens'
example,
the
association
isn't
paying
any
money
to
the
members.
the
association,
as
i
understand
his
example,
has
simply
agreed
that
all
of
its
members
will
charge
more
money
for
the
work
that
they
do
and,
hence,
will
bring
in
more
money
into
their
own
coffers.
the
association
isn't
paying
them
anything.
unknown
speaker
what
i'm
driving
at
with
my...
i
gave
a
number
of
classic
cases.
imagine
in
each
of
those
cases
i
change
one
fact,
and
i
don't
know
if
i'm
changing
it.
but
the
trade
association
in
those
cases
was
not
itself
making
a
profit.
all
right,
now
i
want
to
be...
that's
what
i'm
imagining.
unknown
speaker
now,
i
want
to
say
if
i
imagine
that--
unknown
speaker
--they're
not
making
a
profit.
unknown
speaker
i...
that's
correct.
unknown
speaker
because
they're
only
income
is
dues.
unknown
speaker
and
they
spend
all
the
dues.
unknown
speaker
i'm
imagining
that.
unknown
speaker
all
right.
is
there
any
other
difference
between
your
association
and
those?
unknown
speaker
what?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
believe
maple
flooring
would
have
promoted
the
art
and
science
of
maple
flooring.
it's
beautiful,
you
know,
aesthetically
attractive,
and
so
forth.
unknown
speaker
is
there
any
other
purpose...
any
other
difference?
unknown
speaker
may
i
say
at
this
point,
i
notice
your
brief
quoted
that
several
times,
and
you
did
not
quote
the
fact
that
that
was
a
quotation
of
what
professor
knox
had
concluded.
you
treated
it
as
though
it
was
a
finding
by
the
alj.
unknown
speaker
the
finding
is,
of
course--
--it's
just
a
finding
of
fact
that
professor
knox
concluded
that,
not
that
the
alj
concluded
it,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
i
must
say
i
really
was
a
little
troubled
reading
your
brief,
that
you
quoted
it
as
though
it
were
an
independent
finding
of
fact
without
referring
to
the
fact
that
professor
knox
had
so
concluded.
and
i
don't
see
anything
in
the
findings
that
say,
in
so
many
words,
i
believe
everything
that
professor
knox
said.
unknown
speaker
and
what
in
that
says
he
believed
professor
knox?
unknown
speaker
yes.
what
found
to
be
the
fact
was
that
professor
knox
reached
this
conclusion.
unknown
speaker
well,
where?
where
did
he
come
to
the
same
conclusion
other
than
by
quoting
professor
knox?
unknown
speaker
if
that's
so...
let's
assume
he
did
accept
that.
are
you...
are
you
saying
that
the
commission
could
not
conclude
the
following
words?
it
says,
in
practice,
california
dental
prohibits
all
quality
claims.
now,
is
it
your
point
that
that...
those
six
words
i
just...
eight
words
i
just
read
are
not
supported
in
the
record?
in
practice,
california
dental
prohibits
all
quality
claims.
is
it
your
point
that
that
isn't
supported?
unknown
speaker
all
right.
so,
what
you
want
us
to
do
is
to
look
to
see
whether
the
commission
could
reasonably
conclude
in
practice
california
dental
prohibits
all
quality
claims.
unknown
speaker
and
if
i
conclude
that
there
is
enough
evidence,
then
you
lose.
unknown
speaker
counsel,
may
i
ask
you
just
to
back
up
on
something
that
was
puzzling
me
because
you
speak
of
a
full
rule
of
reason
examination.
these
cases
come
from
the
ftc
directly
to
the
court.
so,
you're
not
suggesting...
well,
maybe
you
are...
that
the
court
of
appeals
is
the
appropriate
tribunal
to
engage
in
this
extensive...
you're
saying
that's
what
the
commission
should
have
done.
is
that--
unknown
speaker
--what
more
would
you
have
had
the
commission
do?
unknown
speaker
is
painless
parker
still
there?
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
that's
a
different...
that's
a
different
matter.
whether
prices
have
gone
up
or
not,
i
take
it,
is
not
something
the
ftc
has
to
prove.
what
they
have
to
prove
is
that
there's
a
restriction
on
competition
and
a
determination
that
california
dental
prohibits
all
quality
claims
is
the
restriction
on
competition.
that
is
a
determination
that
the
members
of
the
association
have
agreed
not
to
compete
in
respect
of
making
quality
claims.
what
else
do
you
want?
that
is
the
restriction
on
competition?
why
do
you
have
to
have
some
big
market
investigation?
i
mean,
maybe
it's
justified,
as
you
first
said.
that
would
be
a
different
matter.
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
counsel,
you
must
concede
that
sometimes
more
means
nothing
because
it...
you
have
to
disclose
so
much
that
it
becomes
impossible.
unknown
speaker
so,
but
something
that
on
its
face
can
look
like
full
disclosure
can
mean,
in
effect,
you
can't
do
it.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
think
that
the
commission
said
it
was,
at
least
with
respect
to
the--
unknown
speaker
--across-the-board
discount.
unknown
speaker
do
we
owe
any
deference
to
the
commission
saying
that
would
be
such
a
cluttered
ad,
nobody
would...
nobody
would
read
it?
unknown
speaker
um-hum.
unknown
speaker
well,
then
you're
conceding
that
the
additional
disclosure
isn't
a
fact
of
prohibition.
unknown
speaker
you
conceded
that's
the
purpose
of
advertising.
unknown
speaker
i
was
just
saying
that--
unknown
speaker
--an
ad
that
met
all
of
these
requirements
because
your
code
i
think
doesn't
prohibit
them.
it
just
says
you
have
to
do
all
this.
unknown
speaker
if
the
fcc...
ftc
concludes
an
ad
that
cluttered
simply
wouldn't
be
run,
nobody
would
do
it--
unknown
speaker
--don't
we
owe
some
deference
to
that
judgment?
unknown
speaker
well,
it
shows
that
advertising
has
been
restricted.
it
may
not,
in
and
of
itself,
show
that
competition
has
been
affected,
but
advertising
has
certainly
been
restricted.
you
can't
make
that
kind
of
an
advertising
claim.
you
can't
say
10
percent
off
all
fees.
that's
a
restriction,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
don't
we
have
to
assume
that
it
is.
if...
if
the
commission
tells
me
that,
as
a
member,
i
cannot
run
an
advertisement
that
says
10
percent
off
all
charges,
isn't
that
by
definition
a
restriction
on
my
advertising?
unknown
speaker
that's
right.
unknown
speaker
well,
isn't
that
a
restriction?
unknown
speaker
well,
is
it
or
isn't
it?
is
it
or
isn't?
unknown
speaker
well,
then
why
did
you
agree
with
me
when
i
said
that
is
the
restriction
on
competition?
the
marketplace
effects
are
the
effects
of
the
restriction,
not
the
restriction.
i
thought
you
were
agreeing
with
me
on
that,
and
certainly
there
are
dozens
of
cases,
paramount,
famous
laske,
first
national
theaters.
so,
you
don't
have
to
make
a
big
market
investigation.
just
look
to
see
if
there's
a
restriction.
then
see
if
it's
counterbalanced.
very
well.
what
the
ftc
says
is,
we've
looked
into
that.
we
agree
with
you.
there
is
something
to
be
said
for
your
position.
we
agree
that
this
is
misleading
sometimes,
but
on
balance,
we
think
it's
not
worth
it.
okay?
on
balance,
we
think
that
the
restriction
is
worse
than
the
justification.
now,
what
are
we
supposed
to
do
about
that?
you
mean
when
i
read
through
the
record,
i'm
going...
supposed
to
find
out
that
they're
completely
off
base?
is
that
what
you
want
me
to
do?
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
you
on
your
reference
to
quick
look,
whether
you
think
our
opinion
in
the
national
society
of
professional
engineers
case
was
a
quick
look
case
or
not?
unknown
speaker
well,
they
made
an
effort
to
make
a
pro-competitive
justification.
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
you
one
question,
though?
unknown
speaker
when...
when
you
say
they
didn't
go
to
the
second
prong
and
do
the
pro-competitive
analysis,
is...
is
it
your
claim
that
they
did
not...
they
refused
to
receive
evidence
that...
that
indicated
a
pro-competitive
effect
or
their...
their
analytical
treatment
at
the
end
of
the
case
simply
did
not
deal
specifically
with
such
evidence
as
there
was?
unknown
speaker
very
well,
mr.
sfikas.
mr.
wallace,
we'll
hear
from
you.
unknown
speaker
really,
it
says
carrying
on
business.
unknown
speaker
and
you
think
carrying
on
business
embraces
carrying
on
any
activities.
unknown
speaker
if
you
had
a...
a
not-for-profit
corporation
of
doctors
that
does
nothing
but
meet
once
a
month
to
discuss
innovations
in
surgery,
that
association
would
be
carrying
on
business
in
your
definition
of
the
term
here.
unknown
speaker
well,
one
of
the
things
they
point
to
is
that
the
clayton
act...
the
trade...
any
trade
association.
so,
they
have
to
fit
at
least
that.
but
here
they
say
there's
this
formula
that
they
don't
fit
under.
can
you
tell
us
what
is
excluded
from
the
ftc
jurisdiction?
unknown
speaker
but
you
say
pecuniary
benefit
is
all
that's
necessary.
i...
i
think
most...
most
fraternal
organizations,
knights
of
columbus,
the
elk,
and
so
forth,
provide
insurance
for
their
members
at...
at
reduced
rates
because
they
negotiate
good
contracts.
that's
certainly
for
the
pecuniary
benefits
of
all
of
the
members,
and
i
think
it's
a
substantial
incentive
to
join
if
that
is...
if
that
correlates
with
a
substantial
part
of
the
activities
of
the
corporation.
do
you
think
they're
covered?
unknown
speaker
well,
let's
assume
they
don't
use
it
for
business
insurance.
i'm
just
assuming
they
use
it
for...
for
personal...
life
insurance,
personal
life
insurance.
it's
certainly
a
pecuniary
benefit
to
me
that
i
get
life
insurance
at
a
lower
rate.
unknown
speaker
just
out
of
its
general
benevolence
it
has
decided
not
to
move
against
them,
although
it
could.
unknown
speaker
but
you
think...
you
think
they're
subject
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the...
i
really
find
it
hard
to
see
what...
what
the
exemption
was
put
in
for
if
the
knights
of
columbus
and
the
elk
are
covered.
unknown
speaker
when
you
use
the
word
profit,
don't
you
think
the
word
profit
means
not
just
pecuniary
benefit,
but
pecuniary
benefit
that
comes
from
some
commercial
enterprise,
either
investing
or
an
actual
business?
unknown
speaker
so
that
the...
so
that
pecuniary
benefit
to
individuals,
like
the
individual
members
of
the
knights
of
columbus,
wouldn't
count?
unknown
speaker
whereas
business
insurance
for...
for
dentists
might
count.
unknown
speaker
well,
you
had--
unknown
speaker
--mr.
wallace,
may
i
seek
this
clarification?
you
are
trying
to
get
some
kind
of
a
handle
on
pecuniary
benefits
by
using
the
word
substantiality.
unknown
speaker
but
you've
used
that
to
modify
activities.
perhaps
what
it
should
modify
is
the
business
benefits
not...
you
said
it
shouldn't
be
incidental.
it
should
be
substantial.
so,
maybe
the
substantiality
belongs
with
what
is
the
benefit
to
the
business
of
the
dentists
rather
than
the
activity.
or
doesn't
it
matter?
unknown
speaker
a
problem
counsel
is
often
faced
with,
yes.
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
mr.
wallace,
am
i
right
that
in
1917
and
1918,
congress
for
the
people
generally
were
not
thinking
about
the
professions
as
trades
or
businesses--
unknown
speaker
--mr.
wallace,
if
i...
if
i
assume
the
jurisdictional
question
and
say,
yes,
at
one
time
we
didn't
think
of
these
things
as
trades,
now
we
do.
but
still
it's
also
a
professional
organization,
and
this
is
its
ethics
guide.
does
the
commission
and
the
court
owe
any
respect
to
the
medical
association,
the
dental
association
when
they
say
this
is
a
matter
of
ethics,
not
business
and
profit?
unknown
speaker
you're
speaking
generally.
unknown
speaker
i'm
asking
you
specifically
about
professions.
are
they
different
from
people
who
make...
what
was
it...
maple
floors
or
hats
or...
does
that
professional...
is
there
that
much
carryover
from
the
days
when
weren't
considered
commerce
at
all?
unknown
speaker
well,
is
it
up
to
us
or
is
it
up
to
congress
to...
to
declare
when
things
have
become
an
anachronism?
i
mean,
if
congress...
you
think
congress
clearly
thought,
when
this
statute
was
enacted,
that
dentists
associations
and
doctors
associations
and
lawyers
associations
were
not
covered
by
it.
unknown
speaker
i
know.
well--
unknown
speaker
--i
understand.
i
understand
that.
unknown
speaker
but
you
acknowledge
that
congress
did
not
think
that
this
applied
to
the
professions
when
it
was
enacted,
but
it...
but
you
say
it
does
today,
without
congress
having
changed
its
mind.
unknown
speaker
well,
the
language
they
adopted
was
language
which
was
understood
not
to
include
the
professions
at
the
time.
unknown
speaker
but
it
covers
the
professions
today
because
what?
because
we
say
it
covers
the
professions.
unknown
speaker
but,
mr.
wallace--
unknown
speaker
--but
was
the
assumption
of
congress
that
the
statute
might
not
apply
because
they
were
professions
or
because
there
was
doubt
as
to
whether
they
were
insurance?
you
make
the
same
argument
about
the
insurance
industry.
whether
they
were
in
commerce
i
mean.
you
make
the
same
point
about
the
insurance
industry.
it's
pretty
clear
from
national...
southeastern
underwriters
they
didn't
think
it
was
covered,
but
nevertheless
it
is
now.
why
is
this
any
different?
unknown
speaker
cosmetologists.
unknown
speaker
isn't
that
consistent
with
the
petitioner's
argument
that
the
way
we
can
tell
that
an
abbreviated
analysis
is
necessary
is
by
looking
at
the
kind
of
restraint
and
that
is
very
close
to
a
per
se
rule?
isn't
he
right
about
that?
unknown
speaker
well,
so
this
is
sort
of
a
quasi
per
se
category
i
suppose.
unknown
speaker
well,
then
how...
how
are
we
supposed
to
know
then
when
the
abbreviated
rule
of
reason
analysis
is
appropriate?
if
we
don't
have
categories,
what
else
do
we
have?
unknown
speaker
what
were
the
exact
findings?
i'm
just
not
clear
on
that.
the...
the
restriction
i
don't
have
any
problem
with.
i...
i
mean,
i
understand
the
restrictions
that
they
found.
what
were
the
findings
about
the
effects?
unknown
speaker
right.
that's
the
restriction,
but
what...
what
do
we
have
for
effect?
unknown
speaker
i
mean,
i
have
no
question
about
the
restriction,
e.g.,
the
across-the-board
advertising.
i
will
assume
the
commission
is
absolutely
right.
across-the-board
discount
advertising
is
prohibited.
you
can't
run
ads
saying
the
waiting
room
is
comfortable
and
i'm
progressive
and
so
on.
what
do
we
know
about
the
effects
of
that
restriction?
unknown
speaker
do...
do
we
have
specific
commission
findings
to
that
effect?
i
have
not
been
through
the
commission
findings.
unknown
speaker
well,
let
me...
while
you're
looking
for
that--
unknown
speaker
--my
problem
i
think
is
just
this.
i...
i'm...
i'm
aware
of
summaries,
but
i'm
not
aware
of
anything
very
specific.
do
we
have
anything
more
specific
than
this
kind
of
summary,
conclusory--
unknown
speaker
--i
mean,
that's
just
conclusion.
that...
that
to
me
is...
that...
the
existence
of
that
kind
of
conclusion
is...
is
the
basis
for...
for
the
commission's
determination
here
is
what
seems
to
me
to
give
edge
to
justice
kennedy's
question.
we
are
so
close
to
a
per
se
analysis,
that
unless
i'm
going
to
accept
it
as
per
se,
there's
nothing
intuitively
persuasive
about
what
the
commission
says
it
is
so
conclusory.
unknown
speaker
well,
if
those
conclusions
are...
if
those
conclusory
statements
are
sound,
i
don't
have
any
problem
with
the
ultimate
result.
unknown
speaker
they're
not
intuitively
sound.
that's
my
problem.
unknown
speaker
what
the
commission
significantly
didn't
find
and
what
the
court
of
appeals
didn't
find
was
that
dentists
are
more...
are...
are
willing
to...
to
be
constrained
in
their
advertising
rather
than
resign
from
the
association.
all
the
court
of
appeals
said
is...
it
puts
the
burden
on
the
other
side.
the
record
does
not
show
that
dentists
are
willing
to
forego
cda
membership
rather
than
give
up
their
advertisements.
it
seems
to
me
that
if
you
want
to
establish
that
something
is
happening
in
the
market
to
restrain
competition,
it
is
the
opposite
that
has
to
be
proved
by
the
government,
namely
that
dentists
would
rather
forego
advertising
than
be
bounced
out
of
this
association.
and
that's
never
established
anywhere.
the
court
of
appeals
acknowledges
it.
it's
sort
of
an
intermediate
per
se
rule
where
we
don't
say
it's
per
se,
but
we're
going
to
shift
the
burden
to
the
other
side
to
show
that
it
isn't
okay,
you
know.
unknown
speaker
you
say
there
is
such
a
finding,
and...
and
it's
supported
by
the
record?
unknown
speaker
the
court
of
appeals
didn't
find
that
anyway.
unknown
speaker
are
you
aware--
unknown
speaker
--i
don't
see
why...
why
would
that...
have
you
come
across
something
in
writing
that
goes
into
a
question
i've
never
seen
answered?
i
have
no
problem
this
was
a
rule
of
reason.
they
applied,
of
course,
justification
before
deciding
it
was
illegal.
it's
not
a
per
se
rule,
but
when
you
look
to
see
whether
you're
going
to
do
a
thorough
market
effects
test
in
trying
to
figure
out
whether
something
is
competitive
or
not
competitive,
there
can
be
an
infinite
number
of
situations.
sometimes
you
have
to
do
it
in
order
to
see
if
you
have
any
anti-competitive
agreement;
sometimes
you
don't.
sometimes
you
have
to
do
it
to
see
how
serious
the
agreement
is;
sometimes
you
don't.
you're
using
the
rule
of
reason
in
any
case.
but
have
you
come
across
something
that
tries
to
categorize
when
you'd
have
to
do
a
thorough
economic
analysis
to
see
if
you
have
an
anti-competitive
effect,
when
you'd
have
to
do
it
to
see
how
serious
the
anti-competitive
effect
that
appears
from
the
face
agreement
is,
when
you'd
have
to
do
neither?
i've
never
seen
such
a
thing,
but
maybe
there
is--
unknown
speaker
--you
might
have
to
go
into
the
details
in
order
to
decide
whether
it's
serious
enough
in
its
effect
to
overcome
a
justification.
unknown
speaker
excuse
me.
i
do
not
understand
this.
unknown
speaker
could
you
give
me...
just
take
one
pause
between
sentences.
i
don't
understand
how
there
can
be
an
anti-competitive
effect
when
there
is
no
market
power.
do
you
assert
that
that
can
be
the
case?
