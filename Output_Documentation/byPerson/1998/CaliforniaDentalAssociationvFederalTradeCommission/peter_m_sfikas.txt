mr.
peter
m.
sfikas
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
there
are
two
issues
in
this
case.
the
first
is
the
question
of
whether
or
not
the
ftc
act
has
jurisdiction
over
a
nonprofit
professional
association,
and
the
second
issue
is
whether
or
not
the
commission
and
the
ninth
circuit
appropriately
applied
a
quick
look
rule
of
reason
analysis
to
the
facts
in
this
case.
the
jurisdictional
dispute
in
this
case
is
over
the
interpretation
of...
of
the
phrase
in
section
4
of
the
ftc
act,
which
reads
in
its
relevant
part...
and
this
may
be
found
in
the
petitioner's
brief
at
pages
1
and
2...
a
company,
trust,
or
association
without
shares
of
capital
or
capital
stock
which
is
organized
to
carry
on
business
for
its
own
profit
or
that
of
its
members.
there
is
no
disagreement
on
the
record
before
your
honors
that
the
cda
is
a
bona
fide,
not-for-profit
organized
under
california
law,
with
a
501(c)(6)
federal
tax
exemption.
there
are
two
major
cases
that
discuss
this
jurisdictional.
the
first
is
the
community
blood
bank
case
and
the
second
is
the
ama
case.
in
the
blood
bank
case,
both
of
the
respondents
were
not-for-profit
associations.
after
a
full
trial,
the
ftc
and
the
hearing
officer
found
that
they
had
violated
the
antitrust
laws
by
hindering
the
development
of
two
commercial
blood
banks.
on
the
jurisdictional
issue,
the
hearing
officer
who
heard
the
case
and
the
commission
made
specific
findings
that
there
were
benefits
to
members
in
these
cases,
and
that's
how
they
rested
their
jurisdiction.
mr.
peter
m.
sfikas
if
the
court
please,
i've
searched
the
record
and
i
come
to
the
conclusion
that
the
kansas
city
area
hospital
association
was
not
a
501(c)(3).
mr.
peter
m.
sfikas
oh,
yes,
your
honor.
yes.
mr.
peter
m.
sfikas
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
i
am
not.
mr.
peter
m.
sfikas
yes.
if
you...
well,
i
don't
know
that
i'm
going
to
tell
you
that
difference
because
i'm
not
sure
i
know
that
much
about
the
real
estate
board,
your
honor.
but
in
connection
with
the
california
dental
association,
its
primary
purpose
is
for
the
public
interest.
it's
to
promote
the
art
and
science
of
dentistry.
i
think
the
critical
language
in
the
statute
requires,
however,
that
there
be
a
profit,
and
profit
was
defined
in
the
community
blood
bank
case
to
be
the
excess
of
revenue
over
expenses,
with
a
contemplation
that
it
is
to
be
paid
to
the
members.
that
was
not
done
in
the
california
dental
association,
and
that's
clear
in
this
record.
so,
if...
i
don't
know
the
real
estate
board
well
enough
to--
mr.
peter
m.
sfikas
--well,
your
honor,
in
the
seventh
circuit
case
involving
egg
nutrition,
they
made
a...
the
trial
court...
and
it
was
affirmed
in
the
seventh
circuit...
made
a
specific
finding
that
they
were
organized
for
the
profit
of
the
egg
commission.
so
that...
and
that's
not
a
finding
in
this
case,
your
honor.
no
such
finding--
mr.
peter
m.
sfikas
--well--
mr.
peter
m.
sfikas
--oh,
no,
i
wouldn't...
i
wouldn't
say
that
because
the...
the
membership
dues
for
the
tripartite
membership
in
dentistry
is
over
1,000
dollars,
and
i
think
they
get
their...
their
membership
benefits.
but,
your
honor,
as
far
as
the
california
dental
association
is
concerned,
nonmembers
can
get
those
same
services
by
paying
a
little
more
in
the
way
of
a
fee.
there's
nothing
that
the
california
dental
association
does
for
dentists
in
the
state
of
california
that
dentists
can't
get
elsewhere,
and
in
fact,
only
75
percent
of
the
dentists
in
the
state
are
members
of
the
california
dental
association.
mr.
peter
m.
sfikas
that
was...
that
was
not
a
finding,
your
honor.
i
think
what
that
was,
was...
was
a
looking
at
the
way
in
which
the
books
showed
the...
the
amount
of
money
that...
that
the
california
dental
association
gets
largely
from
dues
and
how
it
was
paid
out.
there
was
7
percent
for
public
service,
and
then
there
was
65
percent
for
membership.
but
that
membership
includes
the
promotion
of
the
art
and
science
of
dentistry
and
high
professional
standards,
so
it's
not
mutually
exclusive.
in
other
words,
in
that
65
percent,
there
is
the
promotion
of
the
public
interest.
it's
not
mutually
exclusive.
mr.
peter
m.
sfikas
well,
if
the
court
please,
that
turns
on
the
definition
of
profit.
mr.
peter
m.
sfikas
and
the
community
blood
bank
case
said
that
that's
the
excess
of
revenue
over
expenses,
either
paid
or
contemplated
to
be
paid.
and
clear...
clearly
here
there
has
been
no
dividend
paid,
no
contemplation.
mr.
peter
m.
sfikas
well--
mr.
peter
m.
sfikas
--if
the
court...
well,
no,
your
honor,
not
in
the...
not
in
the
sense
of
the
profit,
the
way
that
term
is
defined
in
the
blood
bank
case
and
in
a
legion
of
cases
that
define
the
term
profit,
your
honor.
mr.
peter
m.
sfikas
well,
if
the
court
please,
the
other
respondent
in
the
community
blood
bank
case
was
not
a
charity.
that
was
the
kansas
city
area
hospital
association.
mr.
peter
m.
sfikas
with
all
due
respect,
your
honor,
i
would
say
that...
that
you
are
wrong,
that
this
is
not
a
trade
association,
that
this
is
different
than
the
egg
nutrition,
for
example,
situation
where
clearly
there
was
a
finding
there
with
reference
to
the
organization
for
its
profits.
that
was
not
a
finding
here.
what
the
ftc
argues
in
this
case,
as
it
did
in
the
blood
bank
case
and
as
it
did
in
the
ama
case,
is--
mr.
peter
m.
sfikas
--no,
i
would
not,
your
honor,
because
i
think
even
though
i
think
the
statute
is
clear
on
its
face
and
you
need
not
go
to
the
legislative
history,
if
you
go
to
the--
mr.
peter
m.
sfikas
--yes,
but
it
is
a
commercial
organization,
and
i
think
the
phrase
that
we're
talking
about
says,
organized
to
conduct
business
and
to
gain
a
profit.
i
think
that
is
doing
business
and--
mr.
peter
m.
sfikas
--correct.
mr.
peter
m.
sfikas
correct.
mr.
peter
m.
sfikas
well,
your
honor,
i
think
if
you
look
at
the
line
of
cases
that
the
ftc
relies
on,
in
many
of
those
cases,
the
sole
purpose
of
the
organization
was
to
evade
the
antitrust
laws.
so,
i...
i
think
it's
very
clear
that
in
those
cases
they
were
making
a
profit,
and
in
some
of
these
other
cases,
i
think
it's
clear
to
say--
mr.
peter
m.
sfikas
--no.
i
think
the
organization--
mr.
peter
m.
sfikas
--indiana
federation
of
dentists,
let's
say.
in
that
case,
that
was
a
guild.
that
guild
was
set
up
to
avoid
the
antitrust
laws--
mr.
peter
m.
sfikas
--and
try
to
get
the
labor
exemption.
i
think
those
cases
fall
in
a
different
category,
your
honor.
mr.
peter
m.
sfikas
your
honor,
that
would
certainly
be
the
case
if
that
were
the
primary,
dominant--
mr.
peter
m.
sfikas
--okay.
your
honor--
mr.
peter
m.
sfikas
--well,
your
honor,
you
make
another
point
that
i
think
is...
is
very
valuable,
and
that
point
is
that
we're
not
asking
for
an
exemption
from
the
antitrust
laws.
clearly
we're
subject
to
the
sherman
act
and
the
clayton
act.
all
we're
saying
here
is
that
congress
intended
to
have
a
limited
statute
for
purposes
of
the
ftc--
mr.
peter
m.
sfikas
--well,
i'm...
i'm
not
sure
how
you
come
to
that,
and
i
respectfully
disagree.
mr.
peter
m.
sfikas
are
you
saying...
i...
forgot
all
the
facts
of
your
hypothetical.
mr.
peter
m.
sfikas
i
would
say
there
that
there
would
be
a
finding
that
it's
organized
for
the
profit
of
its
members
and
that...
that
it
would
then
probably
be
subject
to
the
antitrust
laws.
mr.
peter
m.
sfikas
and
the
federal
trade
commission,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
peter
m.
sfikas
well,
i...
i
think
what
we're
quarreling
about
here
is
the
definition
of
profit.
that
does
not
meet
the
definition
of
profit.
mr.
peter
m.
sfikas
the
difference
is
that
congress
spoke
a
certain
way
in
framing
this
legislation.
this
is
the
same
congress
that
also
enacted
the
clayton
act.
the
clayton
act
and
the
sherman
act
have
very
broad
definitions
of
who
persons
are,
who
corporations
are.
here
clearly
congress
meant
something
else.
what
was
going
on
at
this
time
when
this
act
was
passed
was
the
concern
over
the
big
trusts.
congress
was
not
happy
with
the
way
in
which
the
sherman
act
was
being
prosecuted,
your
honor,
and
as
a
result,
it
wanted
to
establish
an
agency,
such
as
the
federal
trade
commission,
which
would
have
expertise
with
reference
to
industrial
and
commercial
enterprises,
not
nonprofit
professional--
mr.
peter
m.
sfikas
--no,
i...
because...
no.
the
difference
is,
if
what
you're
referring
to
is
justice
stevens'
hypothetical--
mr.
peter
m.
sfikas
--i'm
sorry.
mr.
peter
m.
sfikas
because
of
the
language
in
the
statute,
your
honor.
that's
not
profit.
that's
not
what
is...
what
was
contemplated
by
congress
when
it
used
the
word
profit.
clearly
it
meant
the
excess
of
revenue
over
expense
contemplated
to
be
paid
to
the
members,
your
honor.
mr.
peter
m.
sfikas
no.
what
i
was
saying
was,
as
a
practical
matter,
if
that
case
came
before
a
court,
i
think
the
court
would
make
the
finding
that
they're
organized
to
conduct
business
to
make
a
profit,
your
honor.
mr.
peter
m.
sfikas
are
we
talking
about--
mr.
peter
m.
sfikas
--that
they're
not
making
a
profit--
mr.
peter
m.
sfikas
--as
that
term
is
defined
in
community
blood
bank,
your
honor.
mr.
peter
m.
sfikas
okay.
mr.
peter
m.
sfikas
okay.
mr.
peter
m.
sfikas
okay.
mr.
peter
m.
sfikas
okay.
mr.
peter
m.
sfikas
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
peter
m.
sfikas
we
have
a
public
purpose.
we
promote
the
art
and
science
of
dentistry.
mr.
peter
m.
sfikas
i
do...
i...
i...
that--
mr.
peter
m.
sfikas
--that...
that
is
the
major
difference,
your
honor.
may
i
switch
quickly
to
the...
the
application
of
the...
the
antitrust
laws
to
this
case?
and
may
i
refer
you
to
the
cert,
appendix
246a,
number
326.
the
administrative
law
judge
heard
this
case,
saw
the
witnesses,
reviewed
the
testimony,
came
to
this
conclusion
after
the
trial.
the
activities
of
the
cda
with
respect
to
their
enforcement
of
their
code
of
ethics
relative
to
advertising
has
no
impact
on
competition
in
any
market
in
the
state
of
california,
particularly
with
respect
to
price
and
output.
mr.
peter
m.
sfikas
your
honor,
that
is
a
finding
of
the
alj.
if
you
will
look
at
the
beginning
of
the
alj's
opinion,
he
indicates
that
those
are
findings,
that
everything
in...
that
everything
that
he's
adopted
are
in
his
findings
of
fact,
your
honor.
mr.
peter
m.
sfikas
no,
your
honor,
that's
not
how
i
read
it.
i
read
that...
if
you
look
at
the
analysis
of
the
alj,
he
came
to
the
conclusion
that
the
complaint
counsel
did
not
prove
the
elements
of
a
rule
of
reason
case.
he
held
that
they
did
not
define
a
geographic
market.
he
held--
mr.
peter
m.
sfikas
--well,
your
honor,
what
we
went
on...
and
there's
a
footnote
in
our
brief
that
actually
makes
reference
to
that
where
he
makes
reference
to
the
following.
and
it's
161a
of
the
cert
petition
appendix.
this
decision
is
based
on
the
transcript
of
testimony,
the
exhibits
which
i
received
in
evidence,
and
the
proposed
findings
of
fact
and
conclusions
of
law
and
answers
thereto
filed
by
the
parties.
i
have
adopted
several
proposed
findings
verbatim.
others
have
been
adopted
in
substance.
all
other
findings
are
rejected
either
because
they
are
not
supported
by
the
record
or
because
they
are
irrelevant.
mr.
peter
m.
sfikas
i
think
the...
the
clear
reference
here
is
that
what
is
in
his
findings
of
fact
are
what
he
found
to
be
the
facts
in
this
case,
your
honor.
mr.
peter
m.
sfikas
but
he
came
to
the
same
conclusion
in
his
conclusions.
mr.
peter
m.
sfikas
he
came
to
the
same
conclusion
that
they
did
not
prove
up
the
elements
of
a
rule
of
reason
case,
your
honor.
mr.
peter
m.
sfikas
i
think
it's...
that
not
only
is...
is
my
point,
your
honor,
but
i
believe
that
that's
a
conclusion
that
the
commission
came
to,
which
is
one
that
can
be
reviewed
here.
there's
also
authority
for
the
fact
that
when
there
is
an
inconsistency
in
the
findings
of
the
alj
and
the
commission,
you
may
scrutinize
the
findings.
mr.
peter
m.
sfikas
yes,
your
honor.
we--
mr.
peter
m.
sfikas
--well,
no,
your
honor.
i
think
at
that
point
in
time,
you
look
at
our
pro-competitive
justifications,
and
that's
why
you
need
the
traditional
rule
of
reason
to
balance
here
if
there
is
anything
that's
anti-competitive
with
the
pro-competitive.
and
let
me
tell
you
what
those
pro-competitives
are.
it
is
to
remove
the...
the
untruthful
aspects
of
someone's
advertising.
it
is
to
give
consumers
more
information
so
that
they
may
be
better
shoppers
for
dental
services,
and
it
reduces
search
costs.
if
you...
if
you
provide--
mr.
peter
m.
sfikas
--that's...
that's
what
the
commission
should
have
done,
and
because
they
did
not
do
it,
we
believe
that
you
should
reverse
the
ninth
circuit
court
of
appeals,
your
honor.
mr.
peter
m.
sfikas
i
would
have
had
the
commission
look
to
see
whether
there
are
any
anti-competitive
effects
in
this
case.
all
they...
they
concluded...
they
didn't...
there's...
there's
nothing
in
this
record
to
indicate
whether
advertising
of
dentists
has
been
restrained,
your
honor.
if
you
look
at
the
telephone
books
in
the
state
of
california,
you'll
know
that
that...
that
conclusion
could
not
be
come
to
by
this...
by
this
commission.
mr.
peter
m.
sfikas
no,
your
honor.
no.
he's
gone
on,
your
honor.
he's
gone
on
to
meet
his
just
rewards,
i
think.
[laughter]
but...
but
as
a
matter
of
fact,
your
honor,
you
have
25
percent
of
the...
of
the
dentists
who
don't
belong
to
the
association.
if
the
commission
were
right,
if...
if
what
has
occurred
here
is
the...
cda
has
voluntarily
tied
its
own
hands,
why
wouldn't
the
other
25
percent
use
advertising
and
build
up
their
practice
and
become
extremely
successful,
and
in
becoming
successful,
why
wouldn't
there
be
droves
of
dentists
moving
into...
into
california
to
do
just
that?
there
are
five
dental
schools
in
the
state
of
california.
they
produce
individuals
all
the
time
who
add
to
the
output.
there
has
been
no
restraint.
there
has
been
no
restriction
of
output
and
no
increase
in
prices
here
as
was
the
case
in
the
two
cases
where
you
did
apply
the
quick
look:
the
ncaa
and
the--
mr.
peter
m.
sfikas
--well,
if
the
court
please,
first
of
all,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
all
we
ask
for
is
verification
in
the
ads.
the
ads
are
not
banned.
there
are
no
banning
of
ads
in
this
case.
this
is
not
a
banning
of
ads
case.
this
is
requesting
more
disclosure,
more
information.
this--
mr.
peter
m.
sfikas
--the...
well--
mr.
peter
m.
sfikas
--your
honor,
that...
i
will
agree
that
that
can
happen.
that's
not
this
case,
however.
mr.
peter
m.
sfikas
across-the-board?
mr.
peter
m.
sfikas
well,
with
the
across-the-board
discounts,
the
ftc's
own
witness
testified
that
across-the-board
doesn't
work
because
it
may
fool
customers.
pac
bell
doesn't
permit
across-the-board
in
telephone
books.
so,
if
the
court
please,
the
facts
don't
sustain
the
across-the-board.
but
in
any
event,
all
we
were
requiring...
let's...
let's
take
the
non-across-the-board.
all
we're
saying
is
that
if
a
dentist
wants
to
advertise
a
reduction
in
price,
for
example,
and
you...
you
have
to
include
in
that
ad
the
old
price,
the
reduced
price,
who
it
applies
to,
and
the
length
of
time
that
it
applies.
those
are
very
reasonable,
your
honor.
with
the
across-the-board,
there's
also
evidence
that
all
dentists...
although
dentists
may
do
100
different
treatments,
they
only
do--
mr.
peter
m.
sfikas
--you
mean
the
across-the-board?
mr.
peter
m.
sfikas
well,
i
think
that's
true
too,
your
honor.
mr.
peter
m.
sfikas
no,
no,
no.
mr.
peter
m.
sfikas
oh,
oh.
you're...
i
see.
i
thought
you
were
talking
about
an
across-the-board...
simply
an
across-the-board
ad.
you're
saying--
mr.
peter
m.
sfikas
--with
the
verification.
mr.
peter
m.
sfikas
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
peter
m.
sfikas
well,
but
if
the
court
please--
mr.
peter
m.
sfikas
--well,
if
the
court
please,
let's
pay
deference
to
that
judgment,
but
that's
just
the
beginning
of
the
rule
of
reason
analysis.
that
doesn't
show
that
advertising
has
been
restricted
or
that
output
has
been
reduced
or
prices
have
been
increased,
your
honor.
mr.
peter
m.
sfikas
well,
even
if
we
assumed
that
it
is,
your
honor,
we
have
pro-competitive
justification.
mr.
peter
m.
sfikas
that's
the
across-the-board
that
you're
talking
about.
mr.
peter
m.
sfikas
well,
suppose--
mr.
peter
m.
sfikas
--even
if
it
is,
that's
the
beginning
of
the
rule
of
reason
analysis,
your
honor.
mr.
peter
m.
sfikas
is
a
restriction
if
people
actually
do
advertise
that
way.
i'm
not
sure
that
dentists
advertise
that
way--
mr.
peter
m.
sfikas
--i
think
if
you
read
the
record,
you'd
find
that
to
be
the
case,
your
honor.
but,
no,
i
didn't
believe
that
i
was
being
inconsistent
when
i
answered
the
two
questions.
i
believe
that
even
if
you
assume
that
there
is
something
here
which
is
anti-competitive,
that
you
look
at
the
pro-competitive
justifications
and
you
balance
and
you
don't
do
this
on
a
quick
look.
a
quick
look
is
nothing
more
than
an
expansion
of
the
per
se
rule.
this
court
has
been
moving
away
from
the
per
se
rule.
mr.
peter
m.
sfikas
no,
because
there,
there
was
no...
no
pro-competitive
justification.
mr.
peter
m.
sfikas
no.
it
was
outside
competition,
your
honor.
as
you...
as
your
honor
had
said,
it
was
a
frontal
attack
on
competition.
what
i'd
like
to
do,
if
i
can,
is
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
peter
m.
sfikas
yes.
mr.
peter
m.
sfikas
the
analytical
treatment,
your
honor.
they
simply
dismissed
the
pro-competitive
aspect
of
this
case.
