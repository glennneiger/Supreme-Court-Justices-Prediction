justice
david
h.
souter
this
case
comes
to
us
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
state
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit.
the
california
dental
association
(cda)
is
a
nonprofit
organization
of
dentists
that
gives
it
members'advantageous
access
to
insurance
and
financing
and
lobbies
and
litigates
for
its
members'
interests.
dentist
who
belong
to
the
cda
agree
to
follow
the
cda's
guidelines
and
rulings
regulating
members'
advertising.
the
federal
trade
commission
brought
a
complaint
against
the
cda
alleging
that
the
cda
unfairly
restricts
competition
by
applying
its
advertising
guidelines,
so
as
to
ban
some
truthful
nondeceptive
advertising.
an
administrative
law
judge
held
that
the
commission
had
jurisdiction
and
he
found
that
the
cda
had
restricted
competition
in
two
ways.
first,
by
banning
advertisements
that
state
an
across-the-board
discount
without
giving
exact
prices,
for
example,
10%
off
for
all
senior
citizens;
and
second
by
banning
advertisements
about
quality
of
services
such
as
highest
quality,
most
gentle
service.
the
commission
agreed
with
the
alj
in
the
ninth
circuit
affirmed.
it
found
that
the
commission
had
jurisdiction
and
then
performed
what
is
known
antitrust
law
as
a
"quick
look"
in
which
it
said
that
it
could
easily
conclude
that
the
cda
restrictions
illegally
restrained
competition,
because
the
restrictions
on
price-advertising
or
a
naked
restraint
on
price
competition
and
the
restrictions
on
quality
advertising
were
a
form
of
output
limitation.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
we
vacate
and
remand.
there
are
two
issues:
as
to
the
first,
we
affirm
that
the
commission
had
jurisdiction
over
a
nonprofit
like
the
cda,
which
provides
substantial
economic
benefit
to
its
for-profit
members.
the
federal
trade
commission
act
gives
the
commission
jurisdiction
over
an
entity
that
carries
on
business
for
its
own
profit
or
that
of
its
members.
the
cda
produces
more
than
de
minimis
profit
for
its
members
through
its
insurance
and
financing
arrangements
and
its
litigation
and
lobbying.
the
purpose
of
the
act
is
to
prevent
unfair
competition
and
nonprofit
entities
organized
on
behalf
of
for-profit
members
can
be
as
unfair
as
for-profits.
it
is
on
the
second
issue
that
we
vacate
the
judgment
of
the
ninth
circuit.
we
hold
that
the
"quick-look"
that
the
ninth
circuit
applied
to
the
advertising
restrictions
was
inadequate
in
this
case.
both
types
of
restrictions
appear
designed
to
avoid
false
and
deceptive
advertising
in
a
market
where
the
dentist
knows
much
more
than
the
patient
does.
the
price
advertising
restrictions
might
affect
price
competition
by
limiting
information
available
to
customers
but
they
also
might
help
competition
by
protecting
customers
from
misleading
and
unverifiable
claims
of
across-the-board
discounts.
the
quality
advertisements
restrictions
might
hurt
competition
by
keeping
useful
information
about
the
quality
or
care
away
from
customers,
but
they
might
also
enhance
competition
by
avoiding
false
and
unverifiable
quality
claims.
we
do
not
hold
that
a
full-market
analysis
which
required
only
that
a
"quick-look"
is
not
appropriate
where
such
plausible,
procompetitive
justifications
exist.
what
the
case
calls
for
is
a
closer
look.
aaccordingly,
we
vacate
the
judgment
and
remand
the
ninth
circuit
for
fuller
consideration.
justice
breyer
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
part
and
dissenting
in
part
in
which
justices
stevens,
kennedy
and
ginsburg
join.
