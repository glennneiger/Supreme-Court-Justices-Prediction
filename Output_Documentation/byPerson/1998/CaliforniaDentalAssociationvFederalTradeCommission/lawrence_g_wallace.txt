mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
provision
conferring
jurisdiction
on
the
commission,
section
4
of
the
federal
trade
commission
act,
is
set
forth
in
full
in
the
commission's
opinion
which
is
on
page
48a
of
the
petition
appendix,
the
light
covered
document.
it's...
it's
the
latter
part
of
this
definition
that
is
pertinent
here.
section
4
uses
expansive
language
in
conferring
jurisdiction.
it
extends
the
ordinary
meaning
of
corporation
to
include
any
organization
associated...
organized
to
carry
on
business
for
its
own
profit
or...
or
that
of
its
members,
even
if
it
is
unincorporated
and
even
if
it
lacks
hallmarks
of
a
profit-making
enterprise,
such
as
shares
of
capital
or
capital
stock
or
certificates
of
interest.
so
long
as
it
is
carrying
on
its
activities
for
the
profit
of
its
members,
it
comes
within
the
definition.
and
under
any--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--carrying
on
business,
that
is
correct.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
certainly
in
one
sense,
the
activities
of
an
organization
are
its
business.
those
are
the
purposes
for
which
it
is
organized
and
what
it
is
authorized
to
do
under
its
certificate
of
incorporation.
it
is
hard
to
see
what
else
is
involved
there.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
if...
if
it
were
an
organization
organized
within
the
meaning
of
this
act
and...
and
i
wouldn't
hesitate
to
say
that
it
would
come
within
the
jurisdiction
of
the
commission,
although
as
you
posed
the
hypothetical,
there
would
be
no
reason
to
think
that
there's
any
violation
of
law.
but
if
they
should
add
to
that
some
deceptive
misrepresentations
to
the
public
in
the
form
of
paid
advertising,
it's
only
section
5
of
the
federal
trade
commission
act
that
protects
the
public
against
that
kind
of
activity
which
is
just
as
a
small
organization
that
broke
away
from
the
indiana
dental
association,
the
indiana
federation
of
dentists,
might
have,
in
the
three
communities
in
which
their
membership
was
concentrated,
engaged
in
deceptive
practices
that...
that
should
have
been
of
concern
to
the
commission.
the
mere
fact
that
they're
within
the
jurisdiction
of
the
agency
doesn't
mean
that
the
agency
is
going
to
prevent
them
from
carrying
on
lawful
activities,
but
while
petitioner
says
they're
not
exempt
from
the
antitrust
laws,
they
are
seeking
an
exemption
from
the...
the
federal
statute
that
protects
the
public
against
deceptive
practices.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
i...
i...
the
commission's
own
interpretation
explains
that
in
some
detail
as
they
have
formulated
their
interpretation,
which
is
a
reasonable
interpretation
of...
of
the
language.
as
long
as
the
pecuniary
benefit
that
they're
engendering
for
their
members
is
a
substantial
part
of
the
organization's
total
activities
rather
than
incidental
to
some
noncommercial
activity,
so
they're
not
trying
to
reach
purely
charitable
organizations.
and
in
the
commission's
own
holding
in
the
college
football
association
case,
which
we
cite
on
page
26
of
our
brief,
they
determined
that
they
lacked
jurisdiction
over
a
nonprofit
organization
engaged
in
commercial
activity
for
its
members'
benefits
because
its
members
were
themselves
not-for-profit
organizations.
so--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--and
some
of...
and
some
of
the
members
might
use
that
insurance
for
business
insurance.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
in
that
sense,
it
would
be
for
the
profit
of
the
members.
i
don't
know
of
a
case
in
which
the
commission
has
concerned
itself
with
such
an
organization.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
your
hypothetical
doesn't
suggest
any
violation
of
law--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--well,
the
commission
has...
has
not
quarreled
with
what
we
always
thought
to
be
the
holding
in
community
blood
bank,
that
purely
charitable
organizations
are
not
covered,
and
that
might
include
other
eleemosynary
organizations.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
in
1977,
they
sought
a
change
in
the
law
for
that
purpose.
but
what--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--well,
that...
that
is
certainly--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--that
may--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--well,
that
is
all
we
would
need
to
cover
this
case,
and
so
the
court
doesn't
really
have
to
address
that
issue.
and
it's
certainly--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--a
plausible
way
of
looking
at
profit--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--yes.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
i...
i
did
not
choose
the
35
formulation
that
i
used.
i
was
quoting
the
commission's
formulation
and--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--and...
and...
i
think
the
commission
was
concerned
principally
with
trying
to
avoid
charitable
organizations
which
might
incidentally
engender
something
of
pecuniary
benefit
to
member
organizations
that
use
the
blood
and
are
charging
for
surgery
and
might,
for
example,
be
said
to
be
deriving
some
pecuniary
benefit.
but...
but
i
don't
think
this
case
is
close
to
the
borderline
of
those
definitional
questions
because
these
are
entrepreneurs
engaged
in
profit-making
business.
and
it's
quite
clear
from
the
legislative
history
that
the
conference
committee
deliberately
changed
the
statutory
text
because
they
were
warned
that
a
trade
association
could
become
the
vehicle,
as
it
was
put
in
the
legislative
history,
for
the
imposition
of
horizontal
trade
restraints
among
the
competing
members,
which
is
exactly
the
problem
we're
faced
with
here.
and
the
enforcement
history
of
the
federal
trade
commission
act
is
replete
with
examples
of
the
commission's
exercise
of
jurisdiction
over
trade
associations
of
various
kinds,
all
on
the
assumption
that
the
jurisdiction
extends
that
far.
in...
in...
in
a
very
early
court
of
appeals
decision,
quoted
on
page
20
of
our
brief,
the
national
harness
manufacturers
against
ftc
case,
the
sixth
circuit
in
1920
picked
up
on
the
very
point
made
in
the
legislative
history
in
saying
that
the
language
of
the
act
affords
no
support
for
the
thought
that
individuals,
partnerships,
and
corporations
can
escape
restraint
under
the
act
from
combining
together
in
the
use
of
unfair
methods
of
competition
merely
because
they
employ
as
a
medium
an
unincorporated,
voluntary
association
without
capital
and
not
itself
engaged
in
commercial
business.
and
in
footnote
12
of
our
brief,
we
cite
three
examples
from
volume
1
of
the
federal
trade
commission
reports
in
1917
and
1918
of
trade
associations
that
the
federal
trade
commission
took
action
against--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--that
certainly
is
the
case,
and
what
i
was
leading
up
to
is
that
then
some
of
this
court's
leading
decisions
also
involved
trade
associations
not
involving
the...
the
learned
professions,
ftc
against
cement
institute,
fashion
originators'
guild
against
the
federal
trade
commission.
but
then
more
recently,
there
have
been
at
least
two
cases
on
the
merits
in
this
court
that...
that
did
involve
associations
and
the
learned
professions
where
it
was
just
assumed
that
they
too
fell
within
the
jurisdiction:
ftc
against
indiana
federation
of
dentists,
and
ftc
against
the
superior
court
trial
lawyers
association.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
they
certainly
owe
respect
to
any
litigant
before
the
commission
to
take
seriously
a
pro-competitive
or
other
legitimate
business
justification
that
the
organization
puts
forward
for
a
restraint
that
it
is
imposing
and
to
see
whether
that
justifies
a
restraint
that
otherwise
would
be
a
violation--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--an
unfair
method
of
competition.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
i
think
that
this
court's
decisions
in
goldfarb
and
bates
say
that,
for
the
most
part,
this
distinction
has
become
an
anachronism.
there
are
many
industries
that
affect
the
public
where
people
have
a
high
degree
of
training
in...
in
supplying
foodstuffs
for
the
consumption
of
the
public
and
the
like.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
that
is
precisely
the
argument
that
this
court
unanimously
rejected
in
goldfarb--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--with
respect
to
the
application
of
the
antitrust
laws
themselves--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--and...
and
rejected
in
bates.
and--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--well,
congress
didn't
focus
on
that
question
in...
in
enacting
this
jurisdictional
provision.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
i
think--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--well,
this...
this
court's
decisions.
since
congress
did
not
exclude
their
coverage
and
congress
was
adopting
a
generally
applicable
principle--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--this
court's
decisions
say
that
unanticipated
applications
are
within...
that
are
within
the
language
congress
adopted--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--of
course,
that
was
the
basis
for
doubt
that
the...
the
learned
professions,
so-called,
would
be
covered
because
of
doubt
that
the
scope
of
the
commerce
clause
extended
that
far.
but
if
anything,
the
situation
today
is
even
more
pronounced
in
trying
to
make
a
meaningful
distinction
between
the
learned
professions
than
it
was
at
the
time
goldfarb
and
bates
were
decided.
we
have
so
much
of
the
economy
devoted
to
high
tech
industry
and
sophisticated
service
industries
that
involve
persons
with
high
degrees
of
training
and
skills,
other
professions
are
including
paralegals,
medical
technicians--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--it...
it
becomes
quite
difficult
to
think
that
there
is
a
meaningful
line
to
be
drawn
between
the
sorts
of
enterprises
we're
talking
about
here
in
our
modern
society.
and...
and
it...
there
was
no
hint
in
this
court's
opinions
in
the
superior
trial
court
lawyers
case
or
in
california
federation
of
dentists
of
any
concern
about
that.
of
course,
it
wasn't
an
issue
that
was
raised,
but
that's
because
the
general
assumption
has
been
that
trade
associations
that
operate
for
the
benefit,
the
pecuniary
benefit,
the
profit,
of
their
members
are
covered
by
the
federal
trade
commission
act.
now,
if
i
may
turn
to
the
merits.
the
court
of
appeals
correctly
applied...
and
the
commission
here...
the
rule
of
reason
in
accordance
with
this
court's
modern
jurisprudence
which
approves
a
flexible
inquiry
under
the
rule
of
reasons
that
is
appropriate
to
the
circumstances
of
each
case.
as
i
said
in
connection
with
jurisdiction,
but
it's
very
important
to
the
merits,
this
court
recognized
in
the
professional
engineers
case
that
agreements
among
members
of
a
professional
association
that
govern
the
way
those
members
compete
with
one
another
are
horizontal
restraints
of
trade.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
the
restraints
involved
in
this
case
are
very
close
to
the
kind
of
horizontal
restraints
that
have
been
found
to
be
per
se
violations,
and
that
is
one--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--well,
i...
i...
we...
we've
gotten
away
from
proliferation
of
categories
in
modern
antitrust
thinking.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
in
this...
in
this
instance,
we
have
findings
by
the
commission,
which
addressed
the
pertinent
considerations
and
which
sufficed
for
the
purpose.
and
the
most
important
part
of
the
commission's
inquiry
was
to
find
that
there
were
actual
substantial
anti-competitive
effects
of
these
restraints.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
i
think
they're
summarized
quite
well
by
the
court
of
appeals,
which
reviewed
the
substantiality
of
the
evidence,
and
summarizes
them
on...
if
i
may
turn
to
that,
on
page...
pages
22a
and
23a
of
the
joint
appendix,
that
as
the
commission
found,
petitioner
was
at
the
hub
of
this
agreement
among
the
competitors
that
involved
75
percent
of
the
dentists
in
california.
and
vast
categories
of
advertising
were
totally
banned.
the
court
of
appeals
recognized
that
there
was
some
confusion
in
the
way
this
was
applied.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
i'm
sorry?
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
we
know
that
when
individual
dentists
engaged
in
advertising
of
this
sort,
it
attracted
a
large
number
of
new
patients
and
then
they
refrained
from
engaging
in
it.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
yes.
we
do--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--well,
i'm
referred
to
page
78a
of
the
petition
appendix.
the...
and
we
refer
to
this
on
page
37
of
our
brief
in
the
latter
part
of
the
page.
what
the
commission
found,
in
summary,
was
that
advertising
of
this
kind
was
of
value
to
consumers
who
rely
on
advertising
in
helping--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--well,
that
is
the
most
specific
point
about
consumer
response
to
the
particular
ads.
the
commission
did
say
it
interfered
with
healthy
competition
for
their
patronage.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
the
court
of
appeals
accepted
it
as
a
valid
application
of
the
rule
of
reason,
did
not
think
it
should
reach
the
per
se
issue
or
approve
of
a
per
se--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--well,
all--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--all
of
the
findings
by
the
commission
in
this
case...
and
they
are...
are
numerous...
are...
are
based
on
a
detailed
record
that
was
compiled
through
extensive
discovery,
followed
by
a
2-week
trial.
and
the
central
thing
in
the
record
is
an
analysis
of
petitioner's
challenges
to
advertisements
by
393
dentists
from
1982
to
1993
that
showed
the
nature
of
the
restraints
being
imposed.
then
there
was
testimony,
both--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--as
a
matter
of
fact,
members
of
the
associations
and
of
the
local
associations
testified,
quote,
no
one
gives
up
membership,
unquote,
in
petitioner
to
avoid
its
restrictions
on
advertising.
that
is
on
page
84a
of
the
appendix
to
the
petition.
there
was...
and
they--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--well,
there...
there
is,
yes.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
there
is...
there
is
evidence
to
that
effect,
and...
and
the
commission
did
rely
on...
on
testimony
and
on
the
fact
that
in
many
of
these
case
studies
that
were
followed,
the
applicant
for
membership
or
the
member
gave
up
the
ad
rather
than
risk
his
membership.
this
was--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--a
survey
of
393
examples
in
which
the
commission
imposed
discipline
on
advertising...
which
the...
the
petitioner
imposed
discipline
on
advertising.
and
in
no
instance
of
all
of
those
case
studies
did
the
dentists
choose
to
stay
with
the
ads
and
give
up
membership
because
membership
has
many
values
that
the
petitioner
has
touted
and
that
we
summarize
on
pages
2
and
3
of
our
brief,
including
a
finding
that
justice
kennedy
referred
to
earlier
by
the
commission
that
petitioner...
the
petitioner...
represented
the
value
to
be
anywhere
from
22,000
dollars
to
65,000
dollars
a
year
to
members,
depending
on
the
array
of
services
that
they
chose
to
call
upon.
so,
we
do
have
findings
of
harm
to
competition
from
the
particular
restraints,
and
the
fact
that
they
didn't
result
from
a
more
detailed
inquiry
i
think
is
justified
by
the
fact
that
the
restraints
themselves
are
in
such
a
sensitive
area
of
horizontal
restraint
with
respect
to
advertising
discounts,
they
come...
at
least
they're
akin
to
tampering
with
price
competition
itself.
when
the
competitors
agree
not
to
advertise
discounts,
that
rather
takes
the
incentive
out
of
giving
them
discounts.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
one...
one
source
of
this
is
the
court's
opinion
in
indiana
federation
of
dentists
which
approvingly
quotes
professor
areeda
as
saying
that
market
power
is
but
a
surrogate
for
actual
anti-competitive
effects.
so,
if...
if
a
finding
is
made
of
actual
anti-competitive
effects,
it
isn't
necessary
to
have
a
detailed
inquiry
into
whether
there's
market
power.
the
fact
that
the
anti-competitive
effects
were...
were
effectuated
is
itself
a
showing
of
market
power.
market
power
is
not
what
the
antitrust
law
prohibits.
what
the
antitrust
law
prohibits
is
anti-competitive
effects.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
that's
right.
and...
and
in
this
case,
the
particular
kinds
of
restraints
and
the
anti-competitive
effects
were
ones
at
the
most
sensitive
area
of
the
sherman
act,
the
other
being
an
agreement
to
refrain
from
the
kinds
of
advertising
that
were
bringing
in
large
numbers
of
new
customers,
such
as
quality
claims.
this
is
like
restricting
one's--

mr.
lawrence

well,
the
commission
recognized
that
the
market
was...
that
the
market
was
for
dental
services
and
that
it's
a
localized
market.
but
it
isn't...
the
court
itself
has
said
that
it
isn't
necessary
to
define
and
inquire
into
market
power
when
you
have
evidence
and...
and
justified
findings
of
actual
anti-competitive
effects
because
the
inquiry
into
market
power
is
but
a
surrogate
for
whether
there
were
anti-competitive
effects
of
the
restraints.
