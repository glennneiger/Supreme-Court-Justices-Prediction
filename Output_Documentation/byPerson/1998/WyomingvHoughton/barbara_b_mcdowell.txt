ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
united
states
v.
ross,
the
court
articulated
a
clear,
logical,
and
easily
applied
rule
that
probable
cause
to
search
a
car
gives
the
police
the
authority
to
search
any
container
in
the
car
that
might
contain
the
object
of
the
search.
the
container
should
not
be
exempt
from
that
rule
simply
because
it's
owned
by
a
passenger
whom
the
police
do
not
have
probable
cause
to
arrest.
in
many
such
cases,
like
this
one,
a
police
officer
still
could
reasonably
conclude
that
the
object
of
the
search
may
be
found
in
the
passenger's
purse
or
other
container.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
certainly
the
logic
of
our
position
would
tend
to
extend
to
a
search
of
the
passenger
as
well.
there
might
be--
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
--pardon
me?
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
we
would
conclude
that
the
rationale
of
dire
may
be
incorrect
to
the
extent
that
it
suggests
that
there's
no
probable
cause
to
believe
that
there's
contraband
on
the
passenger.
however,
there
would
be
another
rationale
to
preserve
dire
but
to
allow
the
search
here,
and
that
would
be
to
recognize
that
a
search
of
the
person
is
more
intrusive
for
fourth
amendment
purposes
than
a
search
merely
of
someone's
belongings.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
that's
correct,
but
the
fourth
amendment
also
incorporates
the
concept
of
what
is
a
reasonable
search
and
one
might
be
able
to
say
that
what's
reasonable
in
the
context
of
property
is
not
reasonable
in
the
context
of
a
personal
search.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
perhaps
one
could
say
that
there
needs
to
be
somewhat
more
individualized
suspicion
directed
at
the
person
in
order
to
conduct
a
personal
search.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
perhaps.
also,
we
have
raised
the
possibility
that
in
many
circumstances,
a
driver
of
the
car
who
is
clearly
involved
in
illegal
activity
would
have
an
opportunity
to
store
contraband
in
an
innocent's
passenger's
purse.
it
seems
somewhat
less
likely
that
a
guilty
party
could
reach
into
the
pocket
of
a
purely
innocent
party
and...
and,
totally
unawares,
deposit
contraband
there.
it's
somewhat
easier
to
conceive
of
that
happening
with
respect
to
a
purse
or
other
container
that's
not
on
the
person.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
no.
we
would
say
that
you
cannot--
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
--search
the
person
under
dire.
whether
you
can
search
the
passenger's
belongings
or
not--
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
--pardon
me?
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
oh,
if
you
believe--
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
--i'm
sorry.
i
didn't
understand
your
question.
you
believe
that
it's
in
the
passenger's
pocket?
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
yes.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
in
that
circumstance,
you
would
have
individualized
probable
cause
presumably.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
the
model
code
of
pre-arraignment
procedure
adopted
by
the
american
law
institute
would
suggest
that
you
can.
that
code
adopts
the
rule
that
once
you
have
searched
everywhere
else
in
the
car
and
you
have
reason
to
suspect
that
it
may
be
on
a
passenger's
person--
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
--you
can
search
them.
the
model
code
recognizes
that
that
position
is
somewhat
inconsistent
with
dire,
however.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
well,
there...
there
certainly
is
a
lot
of
logic
to
that
position.
there
are
not
cases--
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
--they
may
not
always
be
the
same
concept.
in
this
case
that
might
be
true
and
then
you
can
conduct
a...
a
search
incident
to
arrest.
we're
not
aware
of
circumstances
where
the
automobile
exception
allowing
a
warrantless
search
of
a
car
has
been
extended
to
persons
in
the
car.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
probably
so,
yes,
your
honor,
depending
on
the
degree
to
which
one
has
suspicion
focused
on
the
individual
at
the
point
that
you
conduct
the
arrest
or
the
search.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
no,
your
honor.
the
question
here
is
a
relatively
simple
one
involving
a...
a
purse
that
was
left
in
the
car
when
the
passengers
got
out.
so,
there
are
possibly
difficult
line-drawing
problems
involving
searches
of
persons
or
purses
attached
to
persons
that
would
not
need
to
be
reached
in
this
case.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
no,
we
wouldn't,
just
as
when
the
police
are
executing
a
search
of
a
residence,
somebody
couldn't
walk
out
with
a
box
containing
the
contraband
and
be
allowed
to
walk
away
free.
we
would
say
that
because
the
purse
was
in
the
car
at
the
time
that
probable
cause
arose--
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
--yes.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
yes.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
yes,
the
d.c.
circuit,
among
others,
pennsylvania,
michigan,
and
wisconsin
supreme
courts
have
reasonably--
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
--other
courts
have
adopted
a
somewhat
different
standard
that
looks
at
the
relationship
between
the
owner
of
the
purse
and
the
residence.
they
have
said
that
a
mere
guest
or
passer-by's
objects
cannot
be
searched,
but
they
have
said
somebody
in
the
nature
of
an
overnight
guest,
somebody
who
is
found
there
late
at
night,
a
business
associate,
a
brother-in-law,
yes.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
no,
that
distinction
hasn't
been
drawn.
so,
conceivably
a
person
who
would
not
have
standing
to
challenge
the
search
of
the
whole
house
could
nonetheless
have
her
own
property
searched.
obviously,
she
would
have
standing
with
respect
to
her
own
purse.
we
further
suggest
that
the
test
that
was
suggested
by
the
wyoming
supreme
court
would
be
very
difficult
for
the
police
to
apply
in
the
often
difficult,
even
dangerous
conditions
of
a
traffic
stop.
it
would
require
many
factual
inquiries
that
might
be
exceedingly
unworkable
to
conduct.
in
addition,
that
test
provides
no
really
principled
protection
of
a
passenger's
privacy.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
well,
for
one
thing,
justice
ginsburg,
the
police
shouldn't
have
to
accept
a
person's
word
that
a
particular
purse
is
hers.
a
person
who
would
want
to
conceal--
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
--could
i
answer
the
question,
your
honor?
there
are
additional
inquiries
that
would
have
to
be
conducted,
inquiries
as
to
exactly
how
much
particularized
suspicion
there
is
as
to
the
passenger,
questions
about
whether
an
opportunity
existed
to
hide
contraband
in
the
passenger's
purse
immediately
before
the
stop,
which
the
wyoming
supreme
court
would
allow.
