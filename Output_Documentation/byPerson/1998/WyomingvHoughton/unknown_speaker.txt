unknown
speaker
am
i
right
that
in...
in
ross
the
reason
that...
the
source,
if
you
will,
of
the
probable
cause
was...
was
information
about...
i
guess
it
was
the
driver
of
the
car,
one
person
anyway?
unknown
speaker
so,
ross
did
not
have
the
issue
in
it
that
we
have
here.
unknown
speaker
could...
could
he
then
go
on
to
search
the
person?
unknown
speaker
if
dire
is
a
given,
if
it's
the
law
that
you
can't
search
the
person,
then
why
is
that
we
can
search
the
purse?
unknown
speaker
well,
do
you
take
the
position
that
probable
cause
extends
to
every
container
in
the
car?
unknown
speaker
how...
how
would
your
test
extend
in
fixed...
a
fixed
premises,
a
building,
as
opposed
to
a
car?
unknown
speaker
not
search
of
a
person.
we're
talking
about
containers--
unknown
speaker
--and
if
there
is
no
warrant
but
there's
probable
cause
to
believe
contraband
is
present?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
i'm
having--
--and
the
automobile
you
say
once
there's
probable
cause
to
believe
contraband
was
present
for
the
driver,
that
it
extends...
probable
cause
extends
to
allow
search
of
any
container
that
could
contain
it
that's
in
the
car.
unknown
speaker
could
i
ask
you
this
question?
because
as
you
pointed
out
earlier,
this
is
the
first
time
we've
gotten
into
the
passenger
problem
with
the
ross/acevedo
line
of
cases.
and
i
was
wondering
what
your
view
would
be
of
this...
this
question.
supposing
the
officer
thought
he
had
probable
cause,
but
in
fact
the
court
would
later
on
decide
he
didn't.
he
just...
it
was
an
illegal
search
of
a
car
that
was
improperly
stopped.
would
the
passenger
in
that
car
have
standing
to
challenge
the
seizure
of
something
in
the
front
seat.
say
a
back-seat
passenger.
could...
would
the
passenger
have
standing
to...
to
challenge
the
search,
do
you
think?
unknown
speaker
he's
not.
unknown
speaker
so
the...
so
the...
the
passenger
would
not
have
standing
to
challenge
the
search
of
the
entire
car,
but
the
right
to
search
the
entire
car
would
include
a
right
to
search
and
invade
the
passenger's
privacy
interest
in
her
own
purse.
it
seems
kind
of
having
it
having
heads
i
win,
tails
you
lose.
unknown
speaker
well,
see,
i'm
trying
to
identify
what
the...
how
you...
how
you
cabin
the
various
interests
in
privacy
which
both
determine
whether
there's
a
violation
on
the
one
hand,
and
also
where
there's
standing
on
the
other.
it
seems
to
me
somewhat
inconsistent
to
say
that
the
privacy
interest
is
insufficient
to
justify
standing
and...
but
nevertheless
can
be...
can
be
invaded
just
because
you
happen
to
be
in
the
car.
that's
the
question.
unknown
speaker
but
mr....
do
i
misunderstand
you
+/?
i...
surely
she
would
have
basis
for
challenging
the
search
of
her
purse--
unknown
speaker
--if
there
were
no
probable
cause
for
the
whole
car.
isn't
that
right?
unknown
speaker
so,
to
the
extent
she
has
a
personal
interest
involved,
she
can
challenge.
unknown
speaker
in
trying
to
decide
how
broad...
broadly
ross
should
be
read,
i'm
thinking
of...
of
a
possible
distinction,
and
i'd
like
you
to
comment
on
it.
one
case
in
which
probable
cause
would
be
established
generally
to
search
the
car
would
be
the
case
that...
that
ross,
read
in...
in
its
most
narrow
sense,
exemplified.
the
driver
of
the
car
is
exhibiting
a
certain
behavior
which
indicates
that
the
driver
of
the
car
is
a
drug
user
and
from
that
it
follows
to
the
requisite
extent
that
there...
there
are
probably
drugs
or
paraphernalia
in
the
car.
the
second
situation
in
which
it
would
be
fair
to
say
that
there
was
probable
cause
to
search
the
car
would
be
the
situation
in
which
a...
a
witness,
whom
we
will
assume
to
be
credible
and
reliable,
goes
to
the
police
officer
and
says,
there
are
three
people
sitting
over
in
that
car
and,
you
know,
they're...
they're
shooting
heroin
or
whatnot.
they're
having
a
high
old
time
on...
on
drugs
over
there.
in
the
second
situation,
i
would
suppose
there's
no
question.
the...
the
probable
cause
relates
to
the
car
and
to
everybody
in
it,
so
that
every
container
in
the
car,
whether
it
belonged
to
a
driver,
passenger,
or
whatnot,
would
be
subject
to
the...
to
the
probable
cause
conclusion.
in
the
first
instance,
however,
in
which
it
is
only
the
behavior
of
the
driver
and
the
driver
alone
which
furnishes
what
we
speak
of
as
probable
cause
to
search
the
car,
that
in
fact
is...
is
not
so.
why
shouldn't
we,
in
effect,
read
ross
as...
as
consistent
with
that
distinction
and
say
that
in
a
case
in
which
probable
cause
relates
to
the
car
and
everybody
in
it,
every
container,
in
effect,
is...
is...
is
open
to
search,
but
when
probable
cause
depends
upon
the
activity
of
only
one
person
in
the
car,
then
although
you
can
generally
search
the
car,
you
cannot
search
containers
which
reasonably
appear
to
belong
to
somebody
else?
why
shouldn't
we
draw
that
line?
unknown
speaker
well,
that's
right,
but
if
that
reasoning
is
going
to
be
carried,
i
suppose,
to
its
conclusion,
then
the
officer
ought
to
be
able
to
search
the
persons
of
the
passengers,
which
dire
tells
us
he
may
not
do.
unknown
speaker
why?
i
mean,
the
standard
is
probable
cause
whether
you're
searching
a
person
or
searching
a...
a
box.
unknown
speaker
well,
are
you
saying
that
there
need
be
no
particularity
requirement
when
you're
searching
something
other
than
a
person?
unknown
speaker
what's...
what's
your
authority
for
that?
unknown
speaker
well,
but
ross...
ross
was
not...
yes,
but
the
question
is
should...
should
ross
be
read
to
cover
my
second
situation
when,
in
fact,
the
facts
in
ross
go
no
further
than
the
first
situation?
unknown
speaker
oh,
broad
language.
no
question.
the...
but
the
question...
i
mean,
as
i
understand
it,
the
question
in
this
case
is,
is
the
language
to
be
read
as
broadly
as
it
was
stated?
is
it
to
be
read
broadly
enough
to
cover
the
second
situation?
and
if...
if
your
answer
is,
that
was
the
language
and
i'm
going
to
go
on
the
answer,
then
i
think
we
still
have
a
question
of...
of
principle
to...
to
wrestle
with,
and
that
is
whether
we
really
ought
to
read
the...
whether
we
ought
to
accept
the
language
as
being
as...
as
broad
as
it
was.
unknown
speaker
in
the
pocket.
that's
very
true,
but
exactly.
it...
it
could
be
concealed
in
the
pocket
just
as
well
as
the
purse,
and
if
we
accept
that
reasoning,
i
don't
know
how
dire
is
going
to
stand
except
we
say,
stare
decisis,
we
won't
look
back.
but
as
a
matter
of
principle,
i
don't
see
how
dire
can
stand.
unknown
speaker
well,
it
will
be
if
we
accept
your
reasoning
i
think--
unknown
speaker
--because
there
will
be
an
implication,
i
think,
that...
that
would...
would
tend
to
undercut
it.
unknown
speaker
one
of
the
problems
with
the
line
you
draw
is...
is
that
this
particular
item,
a
lady's
purse,
contains
things
that
many
gentlemen
carry
in
their...
in
their
pockets.
so,
that's
why
i
raise
the...
if
the...
if
the
lady's
purse,
why
not
the
gentleman's
pocket?
is
that
a
rational
line
to
draw?
what
you're
saying
is
the
key
is
where
might
one
find
contraband.
unknown
speaker
are
you
sure
that
a
search
of
a
purse
is
not
a
search
of
a
person?
suppose
a
woman
is
walking
down
the
street.
is
there
a
difference
between
the
officer
grabbing
her
purse?
he
needs
less...
less
probable
cause
to
just
grab
her
purse
and
look
at
it
than
he
does
to...
to
conduct
a
search
of
her
pockets
or
a
frisk
search?
unknown
speaker
well,
what
are
the
alternatives
for
the
officer
in
a
situation
like
this?
could
he
order
everyone
out
of
the
car
and,
by
the
way,
leave
your
purse
or
any
other
article
in
the
car?
don't
take
it
with
you.
is
that--
unknown
speaker
--authorized--
unknown
speaker
--for
law
enforcement
officers?
unknown
speaker
and
then
what
would
he
have
to
do
if
we
were
not
to
adopt
your
view
here
and
he
wanted
to
search
the
purse
and
there
was
no
particularized
suspicion
with
regard
to
this
woman's
purse?
get
a
search
warrant?
unknown
speaker
i
presume
then
the
same
reasoning
would
extend
to
a
wallet
in
a
man's
pocket.
and
if...
if
the
officer
is
entitled
to...
to
make
the
order
that...
that
you
say
he
is
in
response
to
justice
o'connor,
i
suppose
the
officer
could
say,
everybody
out
of
the
car,
leave
your
purses
and
wallets
on
the
seat.
unknown
speaker
if
she
had
her
purse
in
her
pocket,
it
would
be
a
different
question.
unknown
speaker
but
not
if
she
was
just
holding
the
handle
of
the
purse.
unknown
speaker
it
is
a
little
thin.
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
very
well,
mr.
rehurek.
ms.
mcdowell,
we'll
hear
from
you.
unknown
speaker
we're
probing
why
this
rule
doesn't
extend
to
the
search
of
a
passenger
in
the
car.
it
would
seem
to
me
almost
easier
for
the
driver
to
say,
here,
quick,
take
the
drugs,
to
the
passenger
than
to
stop
and
put
it
in
the
passenger's
purse.
why
can't
we
search
the
passenger
too?
let's
say
dire
is
not
on
the
books.
certainly
under
your...
the
logic
of
your
position,
it
would
clearly
extend
to
the
passenger.
unknown
speaker
is
dire
wrong
then?
unknown
speaker
is
dire
wrong
then?
unknown
speaker
but
the
standard
to
justify
than
search
is
the
same
whether
we're
talking
about
a
search
of
the
person
or...
or
a
search
of
a
receptacle.
i
mean,
it's
still
the
probable
cause
standard.
unknown
speaker
so,
probable
cause...
to
search
the
person,
you're
saying
perhaps
we
would
have
to
say
there
would
be
probable...
required
probable
cause
plus
something
more.
unknown
speaker
i'm
not
sure
why
that
is.
i'd
much
prefer
that
a
police
officer
search
my
pockets
than
my
briefcase.
maybe
that's
just
idiosyncratic
with
me,
but
i--
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
what
is
the
basic
rule?
i
find
it
hard
to
keep
all
these
complicated
rules
in
mind,
so
i
think
maybe
the
police
may
also
find
it
difficult
and
others.
but...
but
suppose
you
have
really
probable
cause,
not
some
artificial
rule,
that
you
really
have
probable
cause
to
think
that
there's
a
pound
of
heroin
in
a
car.
let's
say
the
police
saw
the
pound
of
heroin
and
they
tested
it.
somebody
put
it
in
a
car
and
there
it
was.
the
car
has
been
moving.
there's
been
no
chance.
they've
been
watching
it
the
whole
time.
there's
no
chance
it
could
have
been
disposed
of.
now,
they
stop
the
car.
they
know
it's
in
the
car.
it's
not
on
the
driver.
there
is
one
passenger.
can
you
search
the
passenger,
including
his
billfold?
unknown
speaker
you
cannot?
unknown
speaker
even
if
you
really
have
probable
cause.
unknown
speaker
even
if
you
really
have
probable
cause
to
believe
that
there
is
a
pound
of
heroin
in
the
passenger's
pocket
because
there's
nowhere
else
it
could
possibly
be
and
you
know
it's
there.
unknown
speaker
even
under
those
circumstances,
you
cannot
search
the
passenger?
that's
the
law?
unknown
speaker
look,
i'm
saying
you
know
for
sure
there's
heroin
in
the
car.
you
know
it
for
sure.
you
know
for
sure
it's
not
on
the
driver.
there's
only
one
place
it
could
be:
the
passenger.
can
you
search
the
passenger?
he'd
have
a
bulge
in
his
pocket.
he
has
a
bulge.
right.
[laughter]
exactly.
he
has
a
bulge
and
you
sniff
it.
it's
there.
unknown
speaker
all
right?
unknown
speaker
i
don't
know
what
this
means,
individualized.
i
mean,
you
have
probable
cause
to
believe
it's
in
the
car.
you
can't
find
it
anywhere.
there's
only
one
place
left:
the
passenger.
can
you
search
the
passenger?
unknown
speaker
in
that
hypothetical,
you
could
arrest
him.
unknown
speaker
why
is
it
inconsistent
with
dire?
i
mean,
in...
in
justice
breyer's
example,
at
the
point
the
police
would
conduct
the
search
of
the
passenger's
pocket,
all
the...
all
the
facts
known
to
them
establish
the
probability,
in
quite
a
literal
sense,
that
the
heroin
is
in
the
passenger's
pocket.
why
isn't
that
a
simple
garden
variety
example
of
having
probable
cause
that
points
directly
to
a
given
person
and
nothing
more
than
that?
unknown
speaker
which
is
good
for
starters.
i
mean,
why
isn't
the--
[laughter]
why
doesn't
the
logic...
why
doesn't
logic
win
here?
of
course,
the...
the...
the
next
question
is
what
if...
what
if
you
just
have
probable
cause
to
believe
that
there
is...
that
there's
contraband
in
the
car?
yes.
thank
you.
you're
not
certain
there's
contraband
in
the
car
and
you
search
everywhere
else
and...
and
you
don't
find
it.
and
then
there's
the
passenger
left.
now,
is
probable
cause
plus
probable
cause
enough?
that's...
that's
what's
confusing
me,
of
course.
i
didn't
know
there's
more
of
a
standard
than
probable
cause.
well,
the
thing
that
puzzles
me,
why
don't
you
just
arrest
him
in
that
hypothetical?
you
have
probable
cause
to
arrest
if
you've
got
probable
cause
to
believe
he's
got
heroin
in
his
pocket.
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
you
have
an
exigent
circumstances
exception,
don't
you?
if
you
don't...
well,
you
can
do
one
of
two
things
i
suppose,
and...
and
either
of
two
rules
would
cover
it.
you
can
either
arrest,
as
justice
stevens
says,
in
which
case
you
can
then
conduct
a
search
incident
to
an
arrest,
or
if
you
don't
arrest,
i
suppose
the
exigent
circumstances
exception
would
apply.
i
mean,
you're...
you're...
one
or
the
other
is
going
to
apply,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
do
we
have
to
decide
all
this
stuff
today?
unknown
speaker
well,
would
you
say
that...
the
same
question
i...
i
asked
the
first
counsel.
if
she
left
the
car
clutching
the
bag,
would
you
treat
that
any
differently
than
if
it's
a
container
in
the
car?
unknown
speaker
what
is
your
answer
to
the
warrant
to
search
a
house
and
a
woman
is
in
the
house
with
her
purse.
she
doesn't
live
there.
she's
just
a
guest.
can
you
search
her
purse
then?
unknown
speaker
you
can.
unknown
speaker
has
any
court
held
that?
unknown
speaker
are
there
any
contrary
holdings?
unknown
speaker
and
did
they
more
or
less
correlate
it
to
the
kind
of
person
who
would
have
standing
to
object
to
the...
the
search
of
the
whole
house,
the
overnight
guest
on
the
one
hand
and
a
transient
on
the
other?
unknown
speaker
why
is
it
so
hard
to
apply?
because,
at
least
as
i
read
the
decision,
it
says
when
they
find
out,
they
say,
is
this
your
purse?
she
says,
yes.
she's
a
passenger
they
stopped.
i
don't
see
why
it's
hard
to
apply.
unknown
speaker
well,
when
they...
let's...
i
don't...
the...
as
i
understood
the
wyoming
supreme
court,
they
said
they...
the
police
found
what
was
it?
her
driver's
license.
so,
they
know
that
it's
her
purse.
so,
if...
if
that's
the
line,
they
know
that
it
belongs
to
the
passenger,
that's
not
a
hard
line
to
administer.
there
may
be
other
reasons
to
reject
it.
unknown
speaker
thank
you,
ms.
mcdowell.
ms.
domonkos.
unknown
speaker
well,
ms.
domonkos,
the
wyoming
supreme
court
certainly
did
not
follow
the
language
in
ross
here,
did
it,
in
our
ross
decision?
unknown
speaker
i...
i
thought
ross
said
probable
cause
extends
to
any
container
in
the
car.
unknown
speaker
i
didn't
say--
unknown
speaker
--yes,
go...
go
ahead.
go
ahead.
unknown
speaker
well,
but
didn't
it
say...
it
extended
to
any
container
in
the
automobile?
unknown
speaker
and
the
reason
it
introduced
a
bright
line
rule
was
because
lawyers
and
courts
have
been
hopelessly
confused
by
some
of
our
earlier
decisions
which
parsed
this
thing
to
a
fare-thee-well:
chadwick,
about
whether
the
trunk
was
in
the
car
and
who
saw
it
when;
sanders,
the
same
thing.
ross
straightened
out
a
lot
of
those
things,
and
i'm
concerned
if
we
follow
the
wyoming
supreme
court,
we're
just
going
to
get
right
back
into
that
same
case-by-case
thing
where
people
never
knew
what
the
answer
was.
unknown
speaker
unless
the
suspect
had
immediate
access
to
that
object
before
the
search.
isn't
that
another
exception?
unknown
speaker
well,
so
that
it's
not
as
straightforward
even
as
you've
just
stated
it.
unknown
speaker
would
the
case
have
come
out
differently
if
the
prosecutor
hadn't
made
a
point
of
saying,
now,
we
kept
our
eye
on
that
car
and
we...
we
know
that
there
was
no
opportunity
to
just
slip
this
into
her
purse,
so
she's
responsible?
unknown
speaker
that
isn't
actually
what
they
said.
i
thought
that
the...
what
they
said
on
the
facts
is
that
after
the
officer
shined
the
lights,
nobody
slipped
anything
into
the
purse.
but
they
had
been
driving
together
for
we
know...
we
don't
know
how
long.
i
mean,
that's
what
i
don't
understand
about
this
case.
why
isn't
there
probable
cause
to
believe
it
was
in
the
purse?
you
have
a
person
with
a
syringe
in
his
pocket.
he
says
he's
a
drug
user.
he's
driving
along.
if
you
think
he
has
drugs,
why
wouldn't
you
think
there
would
be
drugs
in
the
car?
and
an
obvious
place
to
put
them
would
be
in
a
purse.
if
you
were
a
drug
user,
you
don't
have
people
driving
in
the
car
when
your
syringe
is
exposed
unless
you
trust
them.
i
mean,
why
doesn't
that
at
least
give
probable
cause
to
search
the
purse,
if
that
makes
a
difference?
unknown
speaker
didn't
she
give
a
false
name
to
the
officers?
unknown
speaker
doesn't...
doesn't
that
suggest
that
the
idea
of
identifying
who's
who
in
a
car
is...
is
not
going
to
be
all
that
straightforward?
i
mean,
to
say...
you
know,
she
says
it's
her
purse.
well,
if
she...
if
she
can
give
a
false
name,
she
can
probably
make
a
false
statement
that
it's
her
purse
too.
unknown
speaker
suppose
he
did.
would
that...
would
you
then
lose
or
not?
unknown
speaker
suppose
after
reading
sorrano
and
so
forth,
i
thought,
well,
to
me
anyway,
he
does
have
probable
cause
to
search
the
purse.
it
makes
a
lot
of
sense.
suppose
i
thought
that.
i'm
just
saying
this
hypothetically.
then
you
lose
or
not?
i'm
not
sure.
i'm
asking
because
i'm
not
sure.
if
he
had
probable
cause
to
search
the
purse,
what's
the
right
analysis?
unknown
speaker
then
that's
it.
unknown
speaker
but
if...
if
he
had
probable
cause
to
search
her,
he
couldn't
do
it,
according
to
the
government.
unknown
speaker
but
he
couldn't
have
searched
her
without
arresting
her
or
something?
forget
it.
[laughter]
as...
as
i
understand
your...
i
think
i'm
right
about
this.
suppose
in
the
back
seat
the
officer
sees
a
tote
bag,
a
gym
bag,
a
man's
lunch
box,
a
brown
paper
sack,
a
gucci
bag,
and
a
purse.
as
i
understand
it,
your
position
is
he
can
search
everything
but
the
purse.
unknown
speaker
and,
of
course,
if
that's
the
rule
that
we
make,
then
probably
the
best
place
for
this
man
to
put
it
would
be
in
the
purse.
unknown
speaker
it's
unlikely
that
a
man
who
is
driving
around
with
a
syringe
sticking
out
of
his
pocket
is
going
to
be
conscious
of
hiding
things.
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
the
question
was
maybe
he
transferred
it
before
the
lights
were
on
the
vehicle.
at
least
in
this
scenario,
this
was
a
terribly
careless
man.
unknown
speaker
suppose
i
wanted
the
simplest
rule
on
the
ground
that
this
a
borderline
case.
it
is
borderline
i
think
and
it's
quite
complex.
what's
the
simplest
rule?
i
mean,
what
they're
arguing
is
that
a
container
is
a
container.
that's
the
end
of
it.
that's
simple.
now,
what
would
you
say?
unknown
speaker
that
would
go
for
trunks,
large
cardboard
boxes,
valises,
chicken
coups,
whatever
the...
the
passenger
says,
oh,
this
all
belongs
to
me.
he
says,
well,
this
is
all
mine.
it's
not
the
driver's,
and
then
that's
it.
you
can't
search
it.
unknown
speaker
well,
are
you
saying
that
the
passenger's
say-so
is
enough?
i
mean,
the
reason
this
purse
was
identified
was
that
there
was
an
id
card
with
her
name
and
her
picture
on
it.
so,
as
i
understood
the
wyoming
supreme
court,
it's
not
enough
that
the
passenger
says,
yes,
that
gym
bag
is
mine
or
whatever.
unknown
speaker
so,
the
presumption
is
that
a
container
in
the
car
belongs
to
the
driver
unless
there
is
affirmative
evidence
to
show
the
contrary.
that
would
be
your
rule.
unknown
speaker
well,
that...
that
kind
of
discriminates
in
favor
of
rich
people
in
a
way,
doesn't
it?
[laughter]
if
you
can
afford
to
have
initials
put
on
your
briefcase,
you
can
avoid
search,
but
if
you
just
have
a...
something
that
doesn't
have
your
initials
on
it,
you
can't?
unknown
speaker
even
i
have
initials
on
my
briefcase,
mr.
chief
justice.
[laughter]
but
the...
the...
the
statement
of
the
passenger
that
this
belongs
to
me
would
not
be
sufficient?
unknown
speaker
well,
what
instances
would
it
be?
you
say
in
most
instances
it
wouldn't
be.
unknown
speaker
well,
if
you've
got
a
male
driver
and
two
female
passengers,
i
suppose
you'd
think
the
purse
didn't
belong
to
the
driver.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
the...
suppose
this
police
officer,
instead
of
just
saying,
is
this
your
purse,
he
said,
is
this
your
purse?
she
says,
yes.
he
says,
mind
if
i
search
it?
that's
a
familiar
scenario.
unknown
speaker
and...
and
the
answer
is
often
yes.
unknown
speaker
she
left
the
bag
too.
i
mean,
most...
most
people,
when
they
have
a
bag...
i
think
a
woman
who
has
a
bag
normally
just
takes
it
with
her,
and
she
left
it
in
the
car.
so,
the
officer
is
thinking,
look,
here
he
has
a
syringe
hanging
out,
he
says
he's
a
drug
user,
she's
been
driving
with
him
i
don't
know
how
long,
there's
a
bag
right
in
the
back
seat,
and
she
leaves
it
in
the
car.
now,
does
that
amount
to
probable
cause
to
search
the
bag?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
had
thought
it
was
a
fairly
straightforward
application
of
ross,
but
you
don't
agree
with
that.
unknown
speaker
well,
but
i
think
it's
you
who
are
wanting
to
carve...
carve
out
the
exception
from
the
language
of
ross
which
says
that
any
container
in
the
car
can
be
searched
when
there's
probable
cause.
you're
saying
no
in
the
case...
case
of
a
passenger.
so,
i
think
the
exception
carving
is
the
wyoming
supreme
court
and
not
your
opponent.
unknown
speaker
well,
but
that's
the
inquiry
that
was
superseded
under
ross.
i
mean,
you
no
longer
had
to
make
that
sort
of
an
inquiry.
when
there
was
probable
cause
to
search
the
car,
you
could
search
any
container
in
the
car.
and
then
so,
what
the
wyoming
supreme
court
here
said
is,
no,
that's
not...
that's
not
quite
true
when
you
have
a
passenger.
unknown
speaker
one
of
the
problems
with
the
ross
opinion
is
it
also
said
the
search
of
the
car
should
be
coextensive
with
the
search
that
would
be
authorized
if
they
had
a
warrant
with
probable
cause.
but
the
problem
is
i
don't
think
the
court
has
ever
decided
whether
even
if
you
had
a
warrant
for
a
house
or
whatever
it
is,
you
could
search
an
individual's
purse
who
happens
to
be
within
the
place
described
in
the
warrant.
i
think
that's
an
open
question,
and
that's
why
ross
doesn't
completely
answer
it.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
well,
the
question
isn't
whether
the
warrant
would
be
issued.
the
question
is
whether...
if
the
warrant
is
issued
describing
the
car,
whether
that
warrant
would
authorize
the
search
of
a
particular
person
who
happens
to
be
in
the
car,
a
person's
purse,
or
whatever
it
is.
and
the
same
question
with...
for
a
house.
and
part
of
the
problem
is
we've
never
decided
it.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
but
that...
that
was...
that
was
a
search
of
a
person,
was
it
not?
ybarra?
unknown
speaker
and
it
was...
it
had
nothing
to
do
with
an
automobile.
unknown
speaker
of
course,
the
bright...
bright
line
rule
in
ross
didn't...
didn't
really
last
all
that
long
because
it
was
changed
in
acevedo.
there
was
a
dramatic
change
in
the
rule
in
that
case.
unknown
speaker
why
isn't
that
true
here...
the
purse?
i
mean,
it's...
i
can't
get
over
the
fact
it's...
perhaps
it's
just
my
own
odd
way
of
looking
at
the
world,
but...
that
it
would
be
an
obvious
thing
for
a
drug
addict
driver
to
put
the
drugs
in
this
purse
which
is
right
next
to
him
or
nearby.
now,
you're
saying
there's
no
way
in
that
situation
that
the
law
permits
a
search
of
the
purse.
i'm
not
saying
ms.
houghton
was
involved,
but
it
just
seems
logical
that
he
could
have
put
it
there.
so,
don't
we
have
probable
cause
for
the
purse,
though
not
necessarily
for
the
person?
unknown
speaker
and
is
it
not...
but...
i
see.
all
right,
we're
back--
unknown
speaker
--why
was
there
not
reason
to
believe
that
it
might
have
been
secreted
in
the
purse?
unknown
speaker
well,
but
would
he
necessarily
see
a
movement
while
he
was
following
the
thing?
i
mean,
it
doesn't
take
much
to
simply
hand
something
from
the
front
seat
to
the
back
seat.
unknown
speaker
but
what
about
putting
it
there
before
he
saw?
i
mean,
we're
back
in
circles,
but
your
answer
to
that
was
simply
there's
a
supreme
court
case
that
says
it
isn't
probable
cause.
right?
unknown
speaker
this
just
doesn't
quite
conform
to
common
sense
in...
in
my
view.
i
think
that's
what
justice
breyer
was
saying.
you
know,
this...
going...
if
i
may
be
forgiven
the
expression,
going
around
robin
hood's
barn
to
figure
out
what
was
going
on
when
it
seems
perfectly
common
sense
to
say
this
guy
was
spotted
for
a...
for
an
offense.
he
was
being
followed
by
the
police.
he
had
a
syringe
in
his
pocket.
if
he
was
going
to
put
his
drugs
somewhere,
he's
going
to
put
them
in
some
container
in
the
car.
what's
wrong
with
that
just
as
a
matter
of
common
sense?
that's
where
i
started.
well,
what's
wrong
is
that
they
didn't
find
him
guilty
of
possessing
drugs.
he
had
an
empty
syringe.
so,
he
didn't
have
any
drugs.
unknown
speaker
well,
but
couldn't
he
have
grabbed
her
purse
perhaps
without
her
knowledge?
unknown
speaker
well,
why
did
he
need
to
have
a...
any
more
reason
to
believe?
the
guy
had
a
syringe.
presumably
he
had
drugs
somewhere,
and
there
were
containers
in
the
car.
why
didn't
that
give
him
probable
cause
to
search
the
containers?
unknown
speaker
she
turned
out...
there
were
drugs
in
her
purse,
were
there
not?
unknown
speaker
but
they
were
her
drugs
not
his,
weren't
they?
[laughter]
but
i
mean,
they're
not...
there's
no
indication
they
were
placed
in
the
purse
by
the
driver.
they
just...
she
happened
to
have
drugs,
and
it's
just
that,
you
know,
they
just
stumbled
on
this
really.
in
fact,
she
probably
planted
the
pipe
on
him.
unknown
speaker
is
that...
is
that
the
case?
i
hadn't
taken
that
in,
that
they...
they
weren't
his
drugs?
unknown
speaker
she
said
they
weren't
mine.
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
the
jury
didn't
believe
that.
she
also
gave
a
false
name.
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
the
driver
and
the
other
passenger
were
clean
as
far
as
the
police
were
concerned.
she
was
the
only
one
prosecuted.
is
that--
unknown
speaker
--did
they
search
her
purse?
and
actually
the
other
passenger
was
in
the
middle,
wasn't
she?
unknown
speaker
and...
and
she...
her...
was
her
purse
searched
too?
unknown
speaker
the
record
doesn't
tell
us
because
you
would
think
if
he
was
going
to
put
them
on...
in
the
purse,
he'd
put
them
in
the
woman
next
to
him
rather
than
the
one
over
by
the
door.
unknown
speaker
what
happened
in
respect...
there
was
something
in...
there's
some
reference
to
her
trying
to
give
the
impression
it
wasn't
her
purse,
isn't
there?
what
was
that
about?
unknown
speaker
can
i
ask
you
one
other
detail?
i'm
sorry.
on
the
fact
are
we
objecting...
are
you
objecting
to
the
search
of
the
purse
or
the
wallet
in
the
purse?
unknown
speaker
but
only
from
the
point
when
they
knew
that
it
was
hers
and
not
young's.
unknown
speaker
thank
you,
mrs.
domonkos.
mr.
rehurek,
you
have
a
minute
remaining.
unknown
speaker
the
honorable
court
is
now
adjourned
until
tomorrow
at
ten
o'clock.
