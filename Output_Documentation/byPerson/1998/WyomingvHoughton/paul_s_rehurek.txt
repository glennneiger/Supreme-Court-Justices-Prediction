mr.
paul
s.
rehurek
rehurek,
your
honor.
mr.
paul
s.
rehurek
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
question
presented
in
this
case
is
whether
the
scope
of
a
search
under
the
automobile
exception
extends
to
the
personal
belongings
of
a
passenger
when
police
have
developed
probable
cause
to
search
a
private
vehicle
generally,
but
have
no
probable
cause
specific
to
the
passenger
or
her
belongings.
under
united
states
v.
ross,
a
search
of
an
automobile
based
on
probable
cause
extends
to
every
part
of
the
vehicle
and
its
contents
that
may
conceal
the
object
of
the
search.
the
officer
here
had
probable
cause
to
search
the
entire
vehicle
and
its
contents
because
he
had
reason
to
believe
that
the
vehicle
was
transporting
contraband
and
that
it
could
be
concealed
anywhere
inside
the
vehicle.
once
probable
cause
is
established
to
search
the
entire
vehicle,
that
probable
cause
extends
to
every
plausible
repository
of
the
object
of
the
search.
mr.
paul
s.
rehurek
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
paul
s.
rehurek
that's
true,
neither
ross
nor
carroll
nor
acevedo
nor
other
cases
from
this
court
on
the
automobile
exception.
the
precise
question
involved
here,
of
course,
involves
the
passenger's
personal
belongings
when
there
isn't
specific
probable
cause.
however,
i
feel
that
ross
still
controls
the
outcome
of
this
case
because
the
rule
announced
in
ross
covers
this
kind
of
situation
and
many,
many
other
kinds
of
situations.
mr.
paul
s.
rehurek
it
absolutely
was,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
it
was
also
a
way
to
allow
officers
to
know
what
the
extent
of
their
legal
authority
was.
and
in
that
regard,
it
was
also
a
way
to
let
citizens
know
what
the
extent
of
their
rights
were.
mr.
paul
s.
rehurek
justice
ginsburg,
there's
two
responses
to
that.
first,
that
item,
the
purse,
is
a
plausible
repository
of
the
contraband
that
was
being
searched
for
here,
and
it
was
inside
the
place
where
the
probable
cause
attached.
in
view
of
that,
i
think
yes,
even
if
the
passenger
had
picked
up
her
purse
and
taken
it
outside
with
her,
the
officer
would
have
been
within
his
authority
to
have
her
put
it
back
in
the
car
or,
alternatively,
to
tell
her
not
to
take...
pick
it
up
and
take
it
out
of
the
car--
mr.
paul
s.
rehurek
--no,
your
honor.
dire
teaches
us
that
a
search
of
a
person
is
going
to
require
the
individualized
probable
cause
that
respondent
wants
to
see
attached
to
the
purse.
mr.
paul
s.
rehurek
your
honor,
i
think
there's
a
dividing
line
here
that...
that's
probably
based
more
on
actual
practice
and
common
sense
than
anything
else.
but
i
would
argue
that
a
line
should
be
drawn
at
articles
of
clothing
that
are
actually
being
worn
by
the
person
getting
out
of
the
car.
if
there's
a
search
of
an
item
of
clothing,
that
amounts
to
a
search
of
the
person.
however,
any
other
object
that
might
be
inside
the
car
when
probable
cause
is
established,
picked
up
and
taken
out
of
the
car,
even
if
it's
an
item
of
clothing,
ought
to
be
subject
to
search
by
the
officer
because
again
it's
at
the
place
when
probable
cause
is
established
and
it's
a
plausible
repository.
mr.
paul
s.
rehurek
only,
justice
o'connor,
with
one
qualification,
and
that
is
that
the
container
has
to
be
capable
of
holding
the
object
of
the
search.
this
court
has
given
an
example
of
illegal
aliens
in
a
van
does
not
give
authority
to
police
to
search
their
suitcase
or
a
lawn
mower
in
a
briefcase
type
of
affair
where
it's
just
physically
impossible
or
for
other
reasons
it's
absolutely
known
that
the
object
of
the
search
won't
be
there.
mr.
paul
s.
rehurek
i
think
the
nature
of
a
search
of
the
person
is
going
to
be
the
same
either--
mr.
paul
s.
rehurek
--oh,
i'm
sorry,
your
honor.
certainly
there's
a
large
body
of
case
law
that
says
when
a
warrant
issues
to
search
a
premises,
that
the...
the...
the
officer
may
execute
that
warrant
by
going
to
every
container
on
the
premises
that's
capable
of
holding
the
object
of
the
search.
mr.
paul
s.
rehurek
on
a
premises?
mr.
paul
s.
rehurek
he
must
get
a
warrant.
mr.
paul
s.
rehurek
i
would
not
personally
characterize
it
that
way,
justice
o'connor.
i
think
the
officer
always
had
probable
cause
to
search
the
entire
car
in
this
particular
situation.
it's
just
that
it
was
mr.
young,
the
driver,
that
furnished
that
probable
cause.
it
didn't...
the
probable
cause
didn't
exactly
start
there
with
mr.
young
and
then
emanate
outwards
through
the
rest
of
the
car.
justice
stevens?
mr.
paul
s.
rehurek
well,
that's
a
rakas
sort
of
situation
by
and
large,
but
if
that
passenger
was
not
the
owner
of
that
property--
mr.
paul
s.
rehurek
--okay.
rakas
tells
us
that
a
passenger
who
is
not
the
owner
of
the
car
has
no
legitimate
expectation
of
privacy
in
places
such
as
under
the
seat
or
in
the
glove
box
or,
for
this
example,
on
the
front
seat
either.
so,
without
that
legitimate
expectation
of
privacy
and
without
knowing
more
about
the
situation,
i
would
say
probably
not,
he
wouldn't
be
able
to
challenge
that.
mr.
paul
s.
rehurek
well,
your
hypothetical
is
premised
on
him
actually
doing
something
he
had
no
legal
authority
to
do.
mr.
paul
s.
rehurek
well,
the
reason
for
the
invasion,
of
course,
is...
and
this
won't
always
be
the
case,
but
the
reason
for
the
invasion
is
that
the
officer
had
probable
cause
for
the
entire
vehicle.
mr.
paul
s.
rehurek
yes.
mr.
paul
s.
rehurek
certainly.
mr.
paul
s.
rehurek
certainly,
certainly.
mr.
paul
s.
rehurek
because,
justice
souter,
you
need
to
take
the
perspective
of
the
officer
involved,
first
of
all.
he
has
established
probable
cause
that
contraband
is
to
be
found
on
the
premises,
whether
it's
a
car,
residence,
whatever.
he
has
established
probable
cause
to
believe
there's...
there's
contraband
on
that
premises.
what
he
doesn't
know
is
that...
is
where
it
is.
it
can
be
in
more
than
one
place.
just
the
fact
that
there
are
several
people
in
a
car
and
only
one
is
actually
observed
using
drugs
doesn't
mean
that
the
others
aren't
involved.
mr.
paul
s.
rehurek
but
i
think
the
fourth
amendment
draws
a
distinct
line
on
search
of
the
person,
and
dire--
mr.
paul
s.
rehurek
--the
standard
isn't
just
probable
cause
for
the
search
of
a
person.
it's
probable
cause
particularized
to
that
person.
now,
here
mr.
young,
the
driver
of
the
car--
mr.
paul
s.
rehurek
--yes.
what
i'm
saying--
mr.
paul
s.
rehurek
--well,
i
think
ross
says
that.
mr.
paul
s.
rehurek
it's
true
the
facts
go
no
further
than
that,
justice
souter,
but
the
rule
announced
in
ross--
mr.
paul
s.
rehurek
--your
honor,
it's
not
just
the
fact
that
the
officer
knows
a
particular
individual
in
that
car
has
drugs.
it's...
it's
that...
that
coupled
with
the
fact
that
contraband
could
be
concealed
anywhere
inside--
mr.
paul
s.
rehurek
--well,
of
course,
dire
really
isn't
involved
in
this
case,
but--
mr.
paul
s.
rehurek
--well--
mr.
paul
s.
rehurek
--well,
i'm
not
trying
to
say
that
the
search
of
the
person
can
occur
without
individualized
probable
cause,
but
i
am
saying
that
when
a
container
is
located
in
a
place
where
there
is
generalized
probable
cause
to
search,
then
that
container
is
subject
to
search
unlike
a
person.
mr.
paul
s.
rehurek
i
recognize
that
situation,
justice
ginsburg.
it
seems
to
me
the
ultimate
criteria,
though,
under
any
hypothetical
or
any
scenario
is
going
to
have
to
be
whether
or
not
the
search
of
the
person
occurred.
mr.
paul
s.
rehurek
i
think
the
search
of
a
purse
that's
being
held
by
somebody
is
not
the
equivalent
of
a
search
of
the
purse
in
the
way
the
search
of
perhaps
the
woman's
coat
that
is
being
worn
at
that
time
would
be.
the
purse
can
be
picked
up
and
put
down.
it
can
be
left.
it
can
be
carried
with.
it's
not
an
article
of
clothing
being
worn.
i
would
draw
the
line,
justice
scalia,
at
that
point
regarding
the
purse.
and
again,
of
course,
the
officer...
officer
can't
just
approach
and
decide
to
search
the
purse
because
it's
not
a
search
of
the
person
and
he
can
get
away
with
it.
he'll
need
probable
cause
for
that
too.
mr.
paul
s.
rehurek
i
believe
he
could--
mr.
paul
s.
rehurek
--i
believe
he
could,
justice--
mr.
paul
s.
rehurek
--i
believe
he
could,
justice
o'connor.
mr.
paul
s.
rehurek
well,
the
search
warrant
apparently
wouldn't
cover
it
either
because
under
ross,
the
scope
of
the
automobile
search
is
going
to
be
the
same
as
the
scope
of
the
search
pursuant
to
a
warrant,
and
neither
one
would
cover,
if
respondent's
rule
was
adopted.
however,
in
my
view
it
certainly
would
have
been
covered
by
a
warrant
had
a
warrant
issued,
but
not
because
the
officer
had
particularized
probable
cause
to
the
purse,
but
because
the
purse
was
located
in
a
place
where
the
officer
did
have
probable
cause
to
search
and
that
there
was
a
likelihood
that
the
contraband
could
have
been
found
anywhere.
mr.
paul
s.
rehurek
your
honor,
i
would
draw
this
rather
thin
but
i
think
distinct
line
at
that
point
and
say
pulling
an
item
out
of
your
pocket
is
going
to
be
a
functional
equivalent
of
a
search
of
the
person.
mr.
paul
s.
rehurek
i
believe
it
would.
mr.
paul
s.
rehurek
that's
correct.
it's
a
very
thin
line.
mr.
paul
s.
rehurek
if
i
may,
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
paul
s.
rehurek
thank
you,
your
honor.
i
would
just
ask
the
court,
unless
it
has
questions,
to
envision
a
group
of
officers
in
the
middle
of
the
night
in
wyoming
standing
around
for
60
minutes,
as
just
happened
here,
trying
to
figure
out
whether
they
can
search
the
purse
in
the
back
of
the
car
and
ask
that
this
court
overrule
the
wyoming
supreme
court
and
apply
ross
to
this
situation.
thank
you.
