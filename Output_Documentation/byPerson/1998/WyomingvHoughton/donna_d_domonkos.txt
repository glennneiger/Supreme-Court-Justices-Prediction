ms.
donna
d.
domonkos
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court:
wherever
a
man
may
be,
he
is
entitled
to
know
he
will
be
free
from
unreasonable
searches
and
seizures.
that
is
the
language
from
katz
v.
the
united
states
where
this
court
said
the
fourth
amendment
protects
people
not
places.
this
court
has
also
said
that
it
is
the
owner
of
the
container
who
is
protected
under
the
fourth
amendment.
the
wyoming
supreme
court
recognized
these
rulings
when
it
adopted
the
notice
test.
in
the
first
instance
of
the
notice
test,
if
the
officer
knows
or
reasonably
knows
that
the
container
to
be
searched
does
not
belong
to
the
person
whom
they
have
probable
cause
to
search,
they
cannot
search
it.
ms.
donna
d.
domonkos
it
did
follow
the
language
in
ross.
ms.
donna
d.
domonkos
the...
the
scope
of
the
ross
holding
was
that--
ms.
donna
d.
domonkos
--the
scope
of
the
search.
ms.
donna
d.
domonkos
the
scope
of
the
search
is
that
where...
wherever
the
officer
has
probable
cause
to
believe
that
contraband
may
be
concealed.
and
there
was
no
reason
to
believe
the
officer
in
this
case
had
probable
cause--
ms.
donna
d.
domonkos
--yes.
ross
introduced
a
bright
line
rule.
ms.
donna
d.
domonkos
ross...
the
bright
line
rule
in
ross
was...
was
that
all
containers
could
be
searched.
the
wyoming
supreme
court
notice
test
still
carries
the
presumption
that
all
containers
within
a
vehicle
where
there's
probable
cause
to
believe
contraband
may
be
concealed
can
be
searched,
unless
they
know
or
have
reason
to
know
that
the
container
they
want
to
search
belongs
to
someone
they
do
not
have
probable
cause
to
search.
ms.
donna
d.
domonkos
that's
another
exception--
ms.
donna
d.
domonkos
--but
it's
still
in
compliance
with
this
court's
holdings.
in
zurcher
v.
stanford
daily,
they
said
that
if
the
cop...
or
the
officer
has
reason
to
believe
that
evidence
is
concealed,
they
may
still
search
a
third
party.
so,
once
again
it's
in
compliance
with
this
court's
precedent
that
there
has
to
be
some
kind
of
probable
cause,
some
reason
to
believe
that
this
container
contains
evidence.
in
this
case,
the
officer
was
searching
for
evidence
of
mr.
david
young's
drug
usage.
there
was
no
indication
that
that
drug
usage
evidence
was
going
to
be
in
sandra
houghton's
purse.
ms.
donna
d.
domonkos
yes,
it's
possible
the
outcome
would
have
been
different,
but
since
we
have
evidence
in
this
case
that
says,
from
the
officer
who
testified,
that
the
car
was
under
surveillance
the
entire
time
and
there
was
no
chance
for
david
young
to
slip
any
evidence
into
sandra
houghton's
purse,
there
was
no
reason
to
believe
that
his
possession
crime
would
be...
evidence
of
this
crime
would
be
in
her
purse.
ms.
donna
d.
domonkos
this
court
has
already
rejected
a
similar
argument
in
sibron
v.
new
york
where
they
said
that
the
mere
association
with
a
drug
addict...
and
this
was
a
person...
or
a
case
where
the
person
was
associating
with
these
drug
addicts
for
approximately
8
hours
throughout
a
day.
and
this
court
said
that
was
not
enough
to
presume
that
this
person
was
also
involved
with
drugs.
the
fact
that
sandra
houghton
was
in
this
vehicle
with
someone
that
is
possibly
a
known
drug
addict
cannot
rise
to
that
level
of
probable
cause
unless
the
officer
sees
something.
ms.
donna
d.
domonkos
yes,
she
did,
but
the
officer
didn't
know
this
until
he
did
breach--
ms.
donna
d.
domonkos
--yes,
she
could
make
a
false
statement,
but
in
this
case
we
have
an
officer
who
made
the
determination.
he
made
the
determination
that
he
had
probable
cause
to
search
the
vehicle
because
of
probable
cause
on
david
young.
he
also
said
that
he
knew
the
purse
did
not
belong
to
david
young
and
that
he
did
not
have
probable
cause
on
sandra
houghton--
ms.
donna
d.
domonkos
--i'm
sorry.
ms.
donna
d.
domonkos
yes,
if
he
had
probable
cause
to
search
the
purse,
then--
ms.
donna
d.
domonkos
--then
he
had
probable
cause
to
search
the
purse
and
the
actions
of
the
officer
would
have
been
in
compliance
with
this
court's--
ms.
donna
d.
domonkos
--no,
i
believe
if
he
had
probable
cause
to
search
her,
he
would
have
had
probable
cause
to
search
her
purse,
all
effects.
ms.
donna
d.
domonkos
yes,
your
honor,
if
the
facts
are
the
same
as
in
this
case
where
you
have
a
male
driver,
two
female
passengers,
and
there's
no
reason
to
believe
that
he
has
secreted
something
within
the
purse
because
the
indication
there
at
that
point
is
that
the
purse
does
not
belong
to
david
young.
it
would
be
the
same
as
if
there
is
a
briefcase--
ms.
donna
d.
domonkos
--it
is
possible
that
that
is
the
way
that
he
could
have
done
it,
but
there
would
have
to
be
some
reason
to
believe
that
he
did
before
this...
before
he
would
be
allowed
to--
ms.
donna
d.
domonkos
--yes.
i'm
not
sure
i
understand
the...
if
there
was
a
question.
ms.
donna
d.
domonkos
yes.
but
once
again,
if
he
had
transferred
something
before
the
officer
had
shined
the
light
or
before
he
started
observing,
then
he
would
have
no
reason
to
believe
that
the
evidence
had
been
secreted
within
this
purse.
ms.
donna
d.
domonkos
the...
the
rule
would
be
that
where
there
is
only
one
person
within
a
vehicle,
if
you
have
probable
cause
to
search
the
vehicle,
you
may
search
all
containers
within
the
vehicle.
if
there
is
a
passenger
present
and
you
know
the
item
you
want
to
search
belongs
to
the
passenger,
then
you
cannot
search
unless
you
have
probable
cause
to
search
the
passenger.
ms.
donna
d.
domonkos
yes,
because
there
would
be
no
probable
cause,
and
this
court
has
required
probable
cause.
ms.
donna
d.
domonkos
there
has
to
be
objective
criteria
that
indicates
that
it
belongs
to
the
passenger.
in
this
case,
the
officer
said
he
didn't
believe
it
belonged
to
david
young
because
he
was
male
and
this
was
a
purse,
and
so
it
would
belong
to
one
of
the
passengers
who
were
female.
ms.
donna
d.
domonkos
that's
correct.
and
that
evidence
can
come
in
many
ways:
initials
on
a
briefcase,
so
if
you
have
someone
asserting
ownership
over
the
briefcase,
and
the
initials
on
the
briefcase
do
not--
ms.
donna
d.
domonkos
--i'm
just
saying
there's
objective
criteria
to
look
for
and
that
could
be
one
of
them.
ms.
donna
d.
domonkos
in
most
instances,
not.
ms.
donna
d.
domonkos
in
instances
like
in
this
case
where
we
have
the
belief
of
the
officer
that
it
did
not
belong
to
the
driver.
he
had
some
criteria
that
he
looked
at
and
he
said
it
did
not
belong
to
the
driver.
ms.
donna
d.
domonkos
that's
correct.
ms.
donna
d.
domonkos
and
so
that,
with
claiming
ownership
from
sandra
houghton,
is
enough
to...
to
say,
okay,
this
item
does
not
belong
to
the
driver.
it
belongs
to
the
passenger.
now
you
must
have
probable
cause
to
search
the
passenger
before...
you
have
to
have
the
probable
cause
before
the
search
can
commence.
ms.
donna
d.
domonkos
yes,
it
is.
ms.
donna
d.
domonkos
and
if
there
is
a
yes
answer
that
he
can
search
it,
then
he
has
consent
to
search,
and
there
would
be
no...
no
problem
with
the
validity
of
the
search.
ms.
donna
d.
domonkos
no,
your
honor,
and
the
reason
for
that
is
because
there's
no
indication
that
this
was
a
voluntary
leaving
the
bag
in
the
car.
we
also
don't
want
to
encourage
them
to
be
grabbing
for
these
kind
of
items
while
they're
getting
out
of
the
car
because
then
that's
going
to
pose
a...
a
safety
problem
for
the
officer.
and
so,
it
is...
like
i
said...
and
the
record
does
not
disclose
that
this
was
an
actual
voluntary
leaving
of
the...
the
bag
within
there.
she
was
ordered
out
of
the
car.
the
state's
argument
and
what
they
are
asking
this
court
to
do
is
to
carve
out
an
exception
to
the
probable
cause
requirement
that
this
court
has
held
is
always
necessary
before
a
search
can
happen,
whether
it
be
under
the
automobile
exception
where
all
that
has
been...
all
that
has
changed
with
the
automobile
exception--
ms.
donna
d.
domonkos
--no,
i
do
agree
with
that.
i
do
agree
that
because
there's
probable
cause
required
before
the
officer
may
search,
this
is
the
application
of
ross.
ms.
donna
d.
domonkos
your
honor,
i
would
disagree
because
of
the
fact
that
just
like
you
said
with
the
ross
holding,
probable
cause
is
required,
and
in
this
holding,
the
wyoming
supreme
court
said
there
was
no
probable
cause
to
believe
the
evidence
was
going
to
be
found
in
her
personal
effects.
ms.
donna
d.
domonkos
ross
did
not
have
any
passengers,
so
we
really...
we
don't
really
know
what
would
have
happened
had
ross
had
a
passenger,
but
the
fact
remains
that
ross
requires
probable
cause
to
search.
and
also,
ross
also
identified
the
fact
that
it's
the
owner
of
the
container
who
is
protected,
and
the
owner
of
this
container
was
sandra
houghton.
she
is
the
one
protected
by
the
fourth
amendment,
and
that
protection
is
that
unless
there's
probable
cause,
the
search
is
unreasonable.
ms.
donna
d.
domonkos
that
is
correct.
ms.
donna
d.
domonkos
and
we
have
to
take
a
look
at
what
would
have
happened
if
this
officer
had
sought
a
warrant.
i
believe
david
young
possesses
drugs
because
he
had
a
syringe
and
he
admits
to
taking
drugs.
i
also
know
that
in
this
vehicle
was
a
passenger,
sandra
houghton,
and
she
has
a
purse.
i
have
no
reason
to
believe
he
hid
this...
any
evidence
of
his
drug
usage
in
her
purse,
and
i
have
no
probable
cause
to
believe
she
is
involved
with
any
illegal
activity.
would
a
warrant
be
issued
in
that
circumstance?
and
i
don't
believe
it
would
be.
and
so,
under
ross--
ms.
donna
d.
domonkos
--and
that...
that
is
true.
ms.
donna
d.
domonkos
i
guess
we
can
look
to
ybarra,
which
is
the
same
thing
that
the
wyoming
supreme
court
did,
and
they
said,
here
is
a
warrant
that
was
issued,
but
there
was
no
reason
to
believe
that
ybarra
was
involved
with
criminal
activity.
and
so,
the
warrant
would
not
extend--
ms.
donna
d.
domonkos
--yes,
it
was
a
search
of
a
person.
ms.
donna
d.
domonkos
no,
it
did
not.
it's
just
looking
at
the
analogy
of
what
a
warrant
that
was
issued
would
allow,
and
in
ybarra,
it
would
not
allow
this
search
because
the
officer
didn't
have
any
reason
to
believe...
no
probable
cause
to
believe
this
person
was
involved
with
criminal
activity.
ms.
donna
d.
domonkos
yes.
in
that
case
we
then
had
the
probable
cause
just
on
the
container
that
was
in
place
within...
in
the
vehicle.
ms.
donna
d.
domonkos
and
that
is
the
second
part
of
the
notice
test.
if
you
have
reason
to
believe
that
the
evidence
has
been
secreted
within
this
purse,
you
can
search
it.
ms.
donna
d.
domonkos
i'm
sorry.
i
didn't
mean
to
interrupt.
ms.
donna
d.
domonkos
the
officer
said
he
kept
the
vehicle
under
surveillance
from
the
time
that
he
observed
the
speeding
and
the
taillight.
he
kept
it
under
observance
from
that
time
period
till
he
stopped.
once
he
stopped,
he
placed
the
light
on
the
interior
of
the
vehicle
and
he
said
he
saw
no
movement.
ms.
donna
d.
domonkos
he
testified
he
saw
no
movement.
ms.
donna
d.
domonkos
just
that
he
associated
with
drug
addicts,
and
that's
all
that
you
would
have
at
that
point.
and
any
time
prior
to
his
observance--
ms.
donna
d.
domonkos
--the
other
thing
too
is
that
we
have
no
indication
that
sandra
houghton
did
know
about
the
syringe.
the
officer
who
approached
his
vehicle
had
a
better
vantage
point
to
see
within
the
pocket
of
the
driver.
ms.
donna
d.
domonkos
it
is
possible
that
it
could
have
happened,
yes.
but
the
officer
did
not
have
any
reason
to
believe
that
happened.
ms.
donna
d.
domonkos
absent
any
actual
knowledge
that
this
happened,
it
is
just
a
presumption
that
it
could
have
happened,
and
since
the
owner
is
the
one
that
is
protected,
we
have
to
look
at
how
we
are
going
to
protect
sandra
houghton.
and
there
was
no
probable
cause
to
search
her
and
there
was
no--
ms.
donna
d.
domonkos
--that
is
correct.
that
is
correct.
there
were.
ms.
donna
d.
domonkos
always
possible,
yes.
ms.
donna
d.
domonkos
she
actually
disclaimed
ownership
of--
ms.
donna
d.
domonkos
--yes,
of
some
of
the
drugs
that
were
within
her
purse,
but
she
did
claim
ownership
of
some.
ms.
donna
d.
domonkos
yes,
she
did.
ms.
donna
d.
domonkos
that
is
correct.
they
let
mr.
young
and
the
other
passenger
go
that
evening
and
they
did
not
place
him
under
arrest
or
the
other
passenger.
she
was
the
only
one
placed
under
arrest
that
evening.
ms.
donna
d.
domonkos
that
is
correct.
ms.
donna
d.
domonkos
i'm
not
aware
it
if
it
was
or
whether
she
even
had
a
purse.
ms.
donna
d.
domonkos
that
is
correct.
ms.
donna
d.
domonkos
no.
there
were
three
wallet
type
containers
within
the
purse,
and
those
were
where
the
contraband
was
found.
now,
the
first
one
that
was
pulled
out,
she
said
that
is
not
mine,
and
then
another
one
was
pulled
out
and
she
said
that
one
is
mine.
so,
she
did
claim
ownership
even
of
the
contraband
that
was
pulled
out
of
the
purse,
but
she
disclaimed
ownership
of
part
of
the
contraband
that
was
pulled
out
of
the
purse.
the
fourth
amendment
requires
probable
cause,
and
in
this
case
there
was
no
probable
cause
to
search
the
passenger.
the
wyoming
supreme
court
ruling
is
consistent
with
this
court's
holdings
in
ross
and
acevedo
which
require
probable
cause
before
a
container
can
be
searched.
the
state
is
asking
this
court
to
carve
out
an
exception
to
the
probable
cause
requirement
and
say,
your
mere
presence
in
a
vehicle
is
enough
to
search
your
personal
effects
as
long
as
there's
probable
cause
for
the
vehicle
generally.
ms.
donna
d.
domonkos
we
are
objecting
to
the
search
of
the...
of
the
purse.
it
would
also
be
an
objection
to
searching
anything
within
the
purse
as
well.
ms.
donna
d.
domonkos
that
is
correct.
without
probable
cause,
this...
this
search
should
never
have
happened,
and
we're
asking
this
court
to
affirm
the
ruling
of
the
wyoming
supreme
court
when
they
adopted
the
notice
test
that
required
probable
cause
before
a
passenger
could
be
searched
or,
in
the
alternative,
if
they
have
reason
to
believe
that
a
container
is
still
concealing
the
contraband,
that
they
can
search
it.
both
of
these
ideologies
are
consistent
with
this
court's
rulings.
thank
you.
