well,
ross
was
an
effort
to
get...
get
over,
in

sanders

chadwick

some
of
those
cases
that
just
parsed
the
thing
down
to
a
fare-thee-well,
wasn't
it?

thank
you,
mr.

the
case
is

the
second
case
is
wyoming
against
houghton
98-184.
during
a
routine
traffic
stop,
a
wyoming
highway
patrol
officer
noticed
a
hypodermic
syringe
in
the
driver's
shirt
pocket.
with
refreshing
candor,
the
driver
admitted
that
he
used
the
syringe
to
take
drugs.
on
the
basis
of
that
statement
the
officer
ordered
the
driver
and
his
two
women
passengers
including
respondent
out
of
the
car,
while
he
searched
the
vehicle
for
contraband.
one
of
the
items
he
searched
was
respondent's
purse
sitting
on
the
backseat.
inside
the
purse
he
found
drugs
and
drug
paraphernalia.
respondent
was
convicted
on
drug
possession
charges,
but
the
wyoming
supreme
court
reversed
her
conviction,
holding
that
the
search
of
the
purse
violated
the
fourth
amendment
because
the
officer
didn't
have
probable
cause
to
believe
the
respondent
or
a
person
particular
was
concealing
contraband.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
of
the
court
today
and
authored
by
justice
scalia,
we
reverse
the
decision
of
the
supreme
court
of
wyoming.
probable
cause
to
search
a
car
extends
all
containers
in
the
car
capable
of
concealing
the
object
of
the
search.
in
previous
cases
we
have
held
it
is
reasonable
to
conduct
a
warrant
less
search
of
a
car
that
police
have
probable
cause
to
believe
contains
contraband
and
that
search
may
extend
all
containers
within
the
car
capable
of
holding
the
contraband.
the
historical
understanding
of
the
fourth
amendment
of
those
cases
rely
on
does
not
admit
of
the
distinction
based
upon
ownership
of
the
contraband.
justice
breyer
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion
and
justice
stevens
joined
by
justices
ginsburg
and
souter
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion.
