justice
sandra
day
o'connor
the
first
of
these
is
another
americans
with
disabilities
act
case;
sutton
versus
united
airlines.
the
case
comes
to
us
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
tenth
circuit.
in
1990,
congress
passed
the
americans
with
disabilities
act
which
several
others
have
been
referring
to
this
morning
as
the
ada.
it
prohibits
certain
employers
from
discriminating
against
individuals
on
the
basis
of
their
disabilities.
this
case
concerns
the
meaning
of
the
term
disability
as
it
has
used
in
the
act.
the
ada
defines
the
term
to
me
among
other
things
"a
physical
or
mental
impairment
that
substantially
limits
one
or
more
major
life
activities,
or
being
regarded
as
having
such
an
impairment".
consequently,
individuals
have
disabilities
within
the
meaning
of
the
ada
if
they
have
actual
substantially
limiting
impairments
or
are
regarded
as
having
such.
the
petitioners
here
are
twin
sisters,
both
of
whom
have
severe
myopia.
with
the
use
of
corrective
measures
such
as
glasses
or
contact
lenses,
both
have
20-20
vision.
in
1992,
they
applied
to
the
respondent,
a
major
commercial
airline,
for
employment,
as
commercial
airline
pilots.
the
respondent
invited
them
to
an
interview,
but
during
their
interviews
both
petitioners
were
told
they
could
not
work
as
pilots
with
united
airlines
because
they
could
not
meet
the
respondent's
minimum
vision
requirement,
which
is
uncorrected
visual
acuity
of
20/100
or
better.
subsequently,
the
petitioners
filed
a
complaint
claiming
that
the
respondent
discriminated
against
them
on
the
basis
of
their
actual
disability,
their
poor
eye
sight.
alternatively,
the
petitioners
claim
they
were
discriminated
against
on
the
basis
of
a
disability
they
didn't
have,
but
were
regarded
as
having.
the
district
court
dismissed
the
complaint
for
failure
to
state
a
claim
on
which
relief
could
be
granted.
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
tenth
circuit
affirmed,
and
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
we
also
affirm.
we
hold
that
whether
an
individual
is
actually
disabled
should
be
made
with
reference
to
any
measures
that
the
individual
uses
to
mitigate
the
impairment.
three
separate
provisions
of
the
ada,
read
in
concert,
lead
us
to
this
conclusion:
first,
because
the
ada's
definition
of
disability
as
phrased
in
the
present
indicative;
the
definition
should
be
read
as
requiring
that
a
person
be
presently,
not
potentially
or
hypothetically,
substantially
limited
in
order
to
demonstrate
a
disability;
second,
the
ada
by
its
terms
requires
the
disabilities
be
evaluated
with
respect
to
an
individual.
if
individuals
were
evaluated
in
some
hypothetical
uncorrected
state
however
they
would
be
evaluated
as
members
of
a
group.
finally,
and
most
importantly,
congress
included
in
the
act
its
finding
that
43
million
americans
have
one
or
more
physical
or
mental
disabilities
but
if
the
disabilities
were
determined
without
reference
to
corrective
measures
there
would
be
over
a
160
million
disabled
individuals.
consequently,
we
hold
that
plaintiffs
under
the
ada
must
be
evaluated
in
their
corrected
state,
that
is
in
this
case
with
their
corrective
lenses
to
determine
whether
they
are
disabled,
because
with
corrective
lenses
petitioners
have
20-20
vision,
they
are
not
substantially
limited
in
any
major
life
activity,
and
are
not
actually
disabled.
that's
not
the
end
of
the
case
however,
because
if
the
petitioners
can
show
that
they
are
regarded
as
having
a
disability
that
they
do
not
have,
they
are
disabled
within
the
meaning
of
the
ada.
petitioners
alleged
that
respondent's
vision
requirement
itself
demonstrates
they
are
regarded
as
having
substantially
limiting
impairments,
but
physical
requirements
do
not
by
themselves
violate
the
ada.
employers
are
free
to
prefer
some
physical
attributes
over
others
so
long
as
those
attributes
do
not
rise
to
the
level
of
substantially
limiting
impairments.
an
employer
is
free
to
decide
that
some
physical
characteristics
that
are
not
impairments
are
preferable
to
others.
just
as
the
employer
is
free
to
decide
that
some
limiting
but
not
substantially
limiting
impairments
make
individuals
less
than
ideally
suited
for
a
job.
similarly,
the
petitioner's
allegation
that
the
respondent
mistakenly
believes
their
eyesight
substantially
limits
their
ability
to
work
as
global
airline
pilots
is
insufficient
to
state
a
claim
that
the
respondent
regards
and
is
disabled.
assuming
without
deciding
that
work
is
a
major
life
activity
to
be
substantially
limited
in
this
activity
one
must
be
significantly
restricted
in
the
ability
to
work.
petitioners
cannot
claim
to
be
so
limited
because
they
alleged
only
that
they
are
regarded
as
unable
to
work
as
global
airline
pilot,
which
is
a
single
job,
not
a
class
of
jobs.
