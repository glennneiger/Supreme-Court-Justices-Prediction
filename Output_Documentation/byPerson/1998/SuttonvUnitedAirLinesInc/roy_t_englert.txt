mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
26
years
of
interpretation
of
the
rehabilitation
act
and
the
ada,
no
appellate
court
has
ever
held
that
any
person
with
fully
corrected
nearsightedness
is
disabled
or
handicapped.
several
appellate
courts
have
reached
a
contrary
conclusion
and
so
has
the
eeoc
itself
in
a
decision
rendered
the
very
same
year
the
ada
was
passed.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
on
the
corrected
versus
uncorrected--
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
--absolutely
not.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
for
a
number
of
reasons.
one
is
the
eeoc's
own
reversal
of
position,
180
degree
reversal
of
position
from
the
position
taken
contemporaneously
with
the
passage
of
the
act.
another
reason
is
that
this
position
is
taken
only
in
interpretative
guidance,
not
in
a
regulation,
which
under
this
court's
cases
is
treated
quite
differently.
a
third
reason
is
that
the
particular
language
on
which
the
eeoc
and
petitioners
rely
was
added
after
the
comment
period.
now,
that
doesn't
invalidate
it
under
the
apa
and
we've
never
argued
that
it's
invalid
under
the
apa,
but
it
does
affect
the
level
of
deference
under
the
skidmore
test.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
no.
the
kienast
case,
as
far
as
i
know,
has
been
completely
ignored
by
the
eeoc
up
to
and
including
today.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
garret
f.--
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
--yes.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
i
think
not
on
corrected
versus
uncorrected,
justice
breyer,
because
i
think
the
statute
is
clear.
the
phrase...
the
phrase
substantially
limits...
substantially
limits
one
or
more
major
life
activities
of
such
individual--
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
--it
says
none
of
those
things
because
that's
not
the
concepts
of
the
statute.
the
concept
of
the
statute
is,
does
it
or
doesn't
it
substantially
limit?
present
indicative
tense.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
of
course,
justice
breyer.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
of
course.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
no,
that's...
that's
not
correct,
respectfully,
justice
breyer.
all
it
takes
to
be
actually
disabled
under
the
americans
with
disabilities
act
is
a
limitation
of
one
or
more
major
life
activity...
a
substantial
limitation...
excuse
me...
of
one
or
more
major
life
activity.
it
is
virtually
inconceivable
to
me
that
those
people
would
not
have
even
a
single
limitation
on
even
a
single...
single
substantial
limitation
on
even
a
single
major
life
activity.
one
doesn't
need
to--
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
--well,
the
key
words--
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
--the
key
words...
excuse
me.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
the
key
words
are
member
of
the
protected
class.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
this
statute
is
not
like
title
vii
which
protects
black
people,
white
people,
men
and
women,
and
people
who
are
neither
black
nor
white.
it
protects
everybody
in
other
words.
this
statute
defines
a
protected
class
and
in
that
regard
it's
exactly
like
the
age
discrimination
in
employment
act,
not
title
vii,
in
limiting
its
protection
to
a
particular
class.
if
we
have
a
39-year-old
who
is
replaced
by
a
22-year-old
with
very
strong
evidence
that
age
was
a
motivating
factor,
he
has
no
cause
of
action
under
the
age
discrimination
in
employment
act
because
the
statute
was
drawn
not
to
solve
the
entire
societal
problem
of
age
discrimination,
but
to
define
a
protected
class
and
say,
once
you
get
through
that
threshold,
then
we
will
make
the
employer
justify
its
decisions.
here
we
have
the
same
thing.
this
statute
was
absolutely
not
designed
to
make
every
employer
disregard
every
physical
criterion.
it
was
designed
to
protect
the
disabled
from
being
the
victims
of
physical
criteria
that
can't
be
justified.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
yes.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
no,
justice
breyer.
i--
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
--i--
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
--i
must
respectfully
disagree
with
you
with
respect
to
both
the
text
of
the
statute
and
the
legislative
history.
with
respect
to
the
text
of
the
statute,
the
finding
of
43
million
people
is
that
there
are
43
million
disabled
americans,
not
that
there
are
43
million
disabled
americans
who
have
been
or
are
likely
to
be
discriminated
against,
but
that
there
are
43
million
disabled
americans.
having
been
discriminated
against
or
being
likely
to
be
discriminated
against
is
not
a
criterion
by
which
that
number
was
derived.
with
respect
to
the
legislative
history,
the
number
can
be
traced
back
through
representative
coelho's
comment
to
the
report
of
the
national
council
on
the
handicapped,
on
the
threshold
of
independence.
and
this
is
a
very
interesting
study
that
in
turn
draws
on
a
census
study,
disability,
functional
limitation,
and
health
insurance
coverage
1984-'85,
which
asks
functional
questions,
and
the
functional
question
it
asks
about
vision
is
do
you
have
trouble
reading
ordinary
newsprint
even
with
glasses?
we
have...
for
those
who
are
inclined
to
consider
legislative
history,
we
have
a
very
powerful
indication
that
congress
had
a
view
on
this
subject.
congress
relied
on
census
bureau
studies,
the
recommendations
of
the
national
council
on
the
handicapped,
which
actually
drafted
the
ada.
in
fact,
a
draft
of
the
bill
is
in
here
and
it
closely
resembles
what
was
in
fact
first
introduced
in
congress
in
1988.
so,
i
think
both
the
text
and
the
legislative
history
don't
allow
that
distinction,
justice
breyer.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
well,
but...
but
first
of
all,
it
has
to
be
an
ambiguous
statute.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
second--
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
--second,
you
referred
to
chevron
deference.
this
is
not
a
case
calling
for
chevron
deference.
this
is
a
case
calling
for
skidmore
deference,
which
is
a
much
lower
standard.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
because
it's
interpretive
guidance.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
because
it's
interpretive
guidance
and
not
regulation,
and
in
general
electric
company
v.
gilbert,
this
court
said,
eeoc
interpretive
guidance
gets--
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
--it
predated
chevron.
i
don't
know
the
exact
date.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
justice
scalia,
i...
i
would
suggest
that
there
are
different
levels
of
deference.
whether
one
refers
to
them
as
skidmore
deference
and
chevron
deference
or
not,
there
are
different
levels
of
deference
for
agency
pronouncements
of
different
formality.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
because--
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
--you
can
give
some--
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
--consistently.
consistently.
there
are
levels
of
deference.
there
are
gradations
of
deference.
consistency
is
one
of
the
factors
to
consider.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
formality.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
no.
i
think
the
case
law
pretty
firmly
supports--
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
--yes.
and...
and
the
court's
opinion,
as
i
read
it,
said
we
need
not
resolve
any
of
these
vexing
deference
questions
because
here
everything
points
in
the
same
direction.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
those
words
were
used
but
there
is
no
allegation
sufficient
to
withstand
a
motion
to
dismiss
on
regarded
as.
no.
the...
the
allegations
of
the
complaint
are
actually
quite
interesting.
the
petitioners--
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
--pages
24
and
25
of
the
joint
appendix.
in
paragraph
38a,
which
i'll
proceed
to
read,
they...
they
assert,
united
asserts
that
its
requirement
for
uncorrected
vision
is
a
rational,
job-related,
safety
requirement.
united
thus
believes
that
plaintiffs'
physical
condition
limits
their
ability
to
perform
the
type
of
work
at
issue
here.
well,
that's
a
very
interesting
allegation,
the
type
of
work
at
issue
here,
and
they
admit
in
their
own
complaint
that
united
thinks
it's
a
rational,
job-related
safety
requirement.
in
paragraph...
subparagraph
e
on
page
25,
on
information
and
belief,
united's
policy
originally
was
modeled
on
military
requirements
for
pilot
training,
without
independent
supporting
basis.
well,
they
want
to
get
into
the
absence
of
an
independent
supporting
basis,
but
they
admit
where
our
standard
came
from.
it
didn't
come
from
myth
and
stereotype.
it
came
from
lots
of
other
standards
for
uncorrected
vision
for
pilots.
the
navy
requires
to
this
day
20/30
uncorrected
vision
for
pilots.
the
air
force
requires
20/50.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
well--
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
--it's
also
alleged,
but
intoning
the
words,
myth,
stereotype,
and
unsubstantiated
fears,
isn't
enough
when
we
have--
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
--no,
but--
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
--the
court
does
not
require
that
much.
but
these
plaintiffs
put
in,
to
their
credit,
some
very
honest
allegations
about
where
united's
standard
came
from.
they
want
to
say...
their
key
allegation
is
united
cannot
substantiate
its
20/100
standard.
but
that's
quite
a
different
allegation
from
saying
that
united's
standard
amounts
to
regarding
everyone
who
doesn't
have
20/100
or
better
uncorrected
vision
as
disabled.
being
regarded
as
not
suitable
for
employment
as
a
pilot
for
united
air
lines
is
quite
different
from
being
regarded
as
disabled.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
well--
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
--justice
breyer,
to
some
extent
this
gets
back
to
our
earlier
colloquy
about
defining
a
protected
class
and...
and
then
invoking
the
protections
of
the
statute.
just
as
not
all
age
discrimination
is
outlawed
by
the
adea,
not
every
irrational
discrimination
involving
a
physical
impairment
is
outlawed
by
this
statute.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
well,
they
were...
they
were--
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
--because
they
were
even
more
specific.
they...
the
class
of
employment
that
they
allege
was
global
airline
pilot,
and
even
they
concede
now
that
that's
not
a
class
of
employment.
so,
that's
one
of
the
facial
defects
in
their
complaint.
another
facial
defect
in
their
complaint
is
that
although
they
talk
about
myth,
fear,
and
stereotype,
their
own
complaint
makes
it
very
clear,
justice
o'connor,
that
what
they
are
complaining
about
is
that
united
has
not
substantiated
standards
that
it
derived
from
somewhere
else.
the
faa
had
a
20/100
standard
until
1990...
20/100
uncorrected
standard
until
1996,
and
the
briefs,
by
the
way
are
slightly
in
error.
they
say
1994
but
it
was
1996.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
there
are
many
examples.
one
of
them
would
be,
mr.
chief
justice,
if...
if
it
is
rumored
that
someone
is
hiv
positive
but
that
person
is
not
in
fact
hiv
positive
and
the
employer
takes
adverse
action
on
that
basis.
the
employer
is
regarding
that
person
as
disabled.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
he
may
be.
the
first
question
is,
is
that
person
actually
disabled?
because
all
that
person
has
to
show
is
any
one
major
life
activity
that
is
impaired...
that
is
substantially
limited
by
his
impairment.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
in
the
hypothetical
situation
where
a
person
with
a
prosthetic
limb
actually
has
no
substantial
limitation
in
any
major
life
activity,
none
at
all,
i
would--
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
--well--
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
--that
does
sound
like
a
case
for
regarded
as.
but...
but
let
me...
let
me
suggest
why
this
is
not
a
case
for
regarded
as.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
well,
the
question
is
whether
it
regarded
them
as
having
an
impairment
that
substantially
limits
one
or
more
major
life
activity.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
no.
i
think
it's
sort
of
a
metaphysical
statement.
united--
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
--but...
but
until
1996,
justice
kennedy,
no
government
authority
had...
that
i'm
aware
of
had
ever
said
don't
look
at
people
in
both
their
corrected
and
their
uncorrected
state.
if
these
people...
if
the
plaintiffs
had
corrected
to
20/30
but
were
20/50
uncorrected,
they
would
be
ineligible
to
be
pilots
for
united
or
even
to
get
an
faa
certificate.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
for
just
the
reason
that
some
of
your
own
earlier
questions
suggested,
justice
o'connor,
which
is
that
eliminating
someone
from
a
single
job
is
not
regarded
as.
everyone
agrees
on
that.
now,
the
question
is
how
much
do
you
have
to
go
beyond
a
single
job
to
make
out
a
regarded
as
claim,
and
we...
we
get
into
questions
about
the
level
of
generality
of
class
of
jobs.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
i
believe
the
grant
of
cert
in
this
case
was
unrestricted,
justice
o'connor.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
no,
not
if
it's
limited
to
major
airlines
and...
and
not
if
it's
limited
to
pilot
positions.
those
are
two
things
that--
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
--not
if
it's
limited
to
just
the
blue
ribbons,
no.
justice--
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
--no.
they
have
to
be
substantially...
if
they're
relying
on
substantial
limitation
of
the
major
life
activity
of
working--
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
--they...
they
must
be
excluded
at...
at
the
minimum
from
a
class
of
jobs.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
the
eeoc's
own--
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
--no.
your
honor,
the
eeoc's
own
interpretive
guidance
actually
addresses--
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
--in
my
view,
being
disqualified
from
a
position
with
every
major
airline
is
not
enough,
and
the
eeoc--
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
--no.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
well,
you...
you
shouldn't
defer
to
it,
but
i
think
it
is
probative,
for
purposes
of
argument,
to
note
that
the
eeoc
does
give
as
an
example
of
something
that
is
too
narrow
to
be
a
class
of
jobs,
commercial
airline
pilot.
let
me
ask
the
court...
the
court's
indulgence
to
think
about
this
example.
doug
flutie
is
a
football
player
who
is
short,
and
he
has
been
a
controversial
football
player
throughout
his
career
because
a
lot
of
people
don't
think
you
should
have
short
quarterbacks
in
the
nfl.
now,
if
these
plaintiffs
were
regarded
as
disabled
because
united
wouldn't
hire
them
as
pilots,
then
i
would
respectfully
suggest
we
have
to
hold
that
doug
flutie
is
regarded
as
disabled
if
the
washington
redskins
and
every
other
team
in
the
nfl
won't
hire
him
as
a
quarterback.
he
does
not
have
an
impairment,
in
fact,
because
being
short,
especially
short
compared
to
pro
football
players,
is
not
an
impairment.
but
he
is
regarded
as
not
suited
for
employment
with
that
particular
employer
because
of
his
impairment
or
because...
because
of
his
height,
because
of
his
physical
characteristic.
not
having
an
impairment
is
a
classic
example
of
not
being
disabled
and
yet
being
regarded
as
being
disabled.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
well,
in
the
example,
doug
flutie
played
in
the
canadian
football
league
for
many
years,
and
i
would
suggest
that
in
and
of
itself,
that
is
enough
to
defeat
a
regarded
as
claim.
but...
but,
justice
scalia,
my
position
is
broader
than
that.
mr.
roy

then
he
could
be
a
coach.
[laughter]
and
coach
is
a
position
for
which
he
is
suited
by
ability,
skill,
and
training,
which
is
the
language
in
the
eeoc's
regulation--
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
--its
interpretive
guidance.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
it
is
something
that
is
suited
to
their
experience,
skills,
and
abilities
which
is
the
language--
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
--they
probably
do,
but
even
that's
not
crystal
clear,
justice
ginsburg,
for
this
reason.
one
has
to
compare
them
functionally
and
not
just
on
the
basis
of
numbers,
like
20/400
or
20/100,
to
the
average
member
of
the
general
population.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
no.
no,
that's...
that's
quite
the
wrong
way
to
look
at
it
i
would
respectfully
suggest,
justice
ginsburg.
you
cannot
make
the
actual
disability
prong
turn
on
the
employer's
perception.
you
can
get
into
the
employer's
perception
in
regarded
as,
as
we
have
been
discussing,
but
in
the
actual
disability--
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
--but...
but
that's...
if
i
may,
justice
ginsburg,
that's
not
correct
either.
the...
the
vision
standard,
which
is
derived
from
a
longstanding
faa
standard,
from
the
international
civil
aviation
organization
standard,
even
from
an
ama
recommendation
that
the
faa
rejected
when
it
changed
the
rule...
the
vision
standard
requires
that
both
corrected
and
uncorrected
be
certain
levels,
20/20
corrected,
20/100
uncorrected.
so,
it's
not
a
matter
of
the
employer
rejecting
the
corrected
measure
and
saying
we
have
no
interest
in
that.
it's
a
matter
of
the
employer
saying,
our
view
of
what
it
takes
to
be
as
safe
a
pilot
as
we
believe
we
should
have
on
this
airline
is
both
of
these
things.
so,
to
conceive
of
it
as
rejecting
the
correction
i
think
is
neither
factually
accurate
nor
to
me
consistent
with
the
way
the
statute
operates.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
i
would
hope
so,
justice
souter,
but
i
can't
have
a
lot
of
confidence
that
we
would
win
that
because
the
eeoc
takes
the
position
that
you
have
to
show
a
direct
threat
to
safety.
i
disagree
with
that
position.
but
having--
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
--and
we
should
win,
justice
souter,
but...
but
the
confidence
that
we
will
win
is
what
i'm
lacking.
reasonable
people
disagree
about
the
right
standard
for
pilots.
i...
i
mentioned
that
the
ama
suggested
20/200,
and
the
faa
rejected
that
suggestion
in
favor
of
looking
just
at
corrected.
are
we
going
to
have
a
battle
of
the
experts
at
which
united's...
united's
view
is
put
into
question
because
it
won't
hire
nearsighted
pilots?
this...
this
ultimately
is
a
safety
issue.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
uncorrected.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
yes.
our
position
is
that
the
verb
substantially
limits
is
meant
to
make
an
actual
and
not
a
hypothetical--
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
--you
take
into
account
the
state
you
find
the
person
in.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
in
general,
according
to
the
eeoc,
personal
use
items
are
not
reasonable
accommodations.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
no,
justice
stevens.
the...
the
uniform
interpretation
of
the
statute
is
that
the
impairment
must
be
of
long
duration
and
not
temporary
for
it
to
qualify
as...
as
a
disability.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
justice
breyer,
i
think
you
do
have
to
accept
that
position
but
i...
i
certainly
would
not
dismiss
out
of
hand
the
possibility
that
the
court
might
think
otherwise
and
that
the
court
might--
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
--the
best
intermediate
position
would
be
that
corrected
versus
uncorrected
would
be
based
on
the
legislative
history
and
that
such
conditions
as
it
appears
were
meant
to
be
considered
in
their
uncorrected
state
according
to
the
legislative
history
should
be
considered
in
their
uncorrected
state.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
the
same
sources
and
they
do
point
in
both
directions.
and
i...
i
agree
with
what
justice
scalia
i
believe
suggested
yesterday,
which
is
it's
all
or
nothing.
but
if
one
were
to
draw
an
intermediate
position,
one
could
derive
some
of
that
from
the
legislative
history.
thank
you.
