unknown
speaker
is
that
raised
in
your
petition
for
certiorari,
whether
they
were
regarded
as
disabled?
unknown
speaker
whereabouts?
unknown
speaker
as
far
as
actual
disability
is
concerned,
let
me
ask
the
same
question
that...
that
we
put
to
counsel
yesterday.
if
myopia,
correctable
myopia,
which
requires
nothing
more
than
eyeglasses,
is
included
within
the
definition
of
disability,
how
do
you
account
for
the
fact
that
the
act
itself
estimates
there
are
some
43
million
disabled
people
in
america?
unknown
speaker
there
would
be
many,
many,
many
more
than
that
if...
if
you
are
counting
people
who
have
to
wear
eyeglasses.
unknown
speaker
how
do
you
find
in
the
text
of
the
statute?
where
do
you
get
that
in
the
statute?
unknown
speaker
it's
a
nice
idea.
maybe
they
could
have
done
that.
how
did
they
do
it
here?
unknown
speaker
i'm
not
following
you.
you're
saying
it's
not
substantially
limiting
if
you
use
some
eyeglasses,
but
it
is...
if
it
can
be
corrected
with
some
eyeglasses,
but
it...
it
is
substantially
limiting
if
it
can
be
corrected
with
other
eyeglasses?
unknown
speaker
i
mean,
the
only
limitation
of
putting
on
eyeglasses
is
putting
on
the
eyeglasses.
i
mean,
you
know,
whatever
the...
the
corrective
prescription
is,
the
only
limitation
involved
is
putting
on
the
eyeglasses,
whereupon
you
see
as
well
as
anybody
else.
but
you're
saying
some
eyeglasses
are
different
from
others.
unknown
speaker
what's...
what's
the
difference
between
someone,
say,
with
20/40
vision
who
puts
on
eyeglasses
and
is
corrected
to
20/20
and
someone
who
has
20...
20/200
vision
and
puts
on
eyeglasses
and
it's
corrected
to
20/20?
so
far
as
their
corrected
state,
they're
both
the
same.
unknown
speaker
could
you
address
the
question
of
why
you
should
look
to
the
uncorrected
state
rather
than
the
corrected
state
in
order
to
determine
whether
the
person
is
disabled?
at
some
point,
would
you...
are
you
going
to
get
to
that?
unknown
speaker
mr.
hughes--
--i--
--this
seems
to
be
a
rather
abstract
categorization.
we
have,
as
i
understand
it,
a
test
that's...
what
is
it?
20
over
120.
that's
how
the
airline
draws
the
line
for
the...
so--
unknown
speaker
--oh,
100,
yes.
would
you
put
all
people
who,
without
the
correction...
go
from
100
to
400...
all
those
people
would
fit
within
the
disabled
category?
because
there's
something
different
between
a
mere
impairment
and
a
substantially
limiting
one.
unknown
speaker
i
would...
i'd
like
you
to
address
what
the
standard
is
in
this
case.
it's
20
over
100.
everyone
who
flunks
that
test
would
meet
your
definition
of
substantially--
unknown
speaker
--but
what
difference
does
that
make
in
terms
of
who
is
being
protected?
here's
a
standard.
a
number
of
people,
all
of
whom
are
visually
impaired,
can't
make
it.
why
would...
and
they're
equally
correctable.
why
would
congress
want
to
say
for
the
ones
who
are,
say,
200,
they
are
protected
by
this
act,
but
the
ones
who
are
only
100
are
not?
unknown
speaker
does
substantial
limitation
take
into
account
the
job
market,
or
is
it
substantial
limitation
in
the
abstract
because
this
definition
covers
all
the
titles
in...
in
the
ada?
unknown
speaker
in
other
words,
what
i'm
getting
at
is
it
might
make...
i
don't...
i'm
not...
i
don't
think
we've
got
this,
but
it
might
make
sense
to
say
your
limitation
is
substantial
if
you
can't
do
the
job
without
putting
the
glasses
on
even
though
your
eyesight
is
imperfect.
and...
and
so,
we
draw
a
pragmatic
line.
but
i'm
guessing
that...
that
even
on
your
theory,
that
is
not
how
we
would
judge
what
is
substantial
because
i
think
we're
dealing
with
a
general
definition
here
which
is
not
limited
simply
to
the
employment
category.
unknown
speaker
so...
so,
that
leaves
us
then
at
sea
as
to...
as
to
what
the
criterion
for
substantial
should
be,
and
i
take
it
you're
not
saying
that
substantial
is
anything
which
is
different
from
the
uncorrected
average
in
the
population.
and
substantial,
we've
just
said,
cannot
be
determined
in
relation
to
what
is
necessary
to
do
the
job.
so,
what
does
it
mean?
where
are
we?
unknown
speaker
no,
but
that...
that
doesn't
take--
--how
do
you
judge
severity?
you
say
you
don't
judge
severity
by
ability
to
do
the
job.
then
what
do
you
judge
it
by?
you
pick
a
number?
100,
200,
300?
unknown
speaker
i
thought
you
said
no.
i
thought
you
said
it's
not
judged
by
the
ability
to
perform
the
job.
unknown
speaker
well,
but...
there
again,
i
don't
know
where
that
gets
us
to
draw
the
line.
i
have
difficulty
reading
restaurant
checks
in
dim
light.
[laughter]
does...
you
know,
there
is...
there
is
an
activity...
a
life
activity
of
reading
in
which
in
some
circumstances
i
have
difficulty.
substantial?
unknown
speaker
why
not?
unknown
speaker
the
waiter
thinks
so.
[laughter]
but
why
not?
seriously.
unknown
speaker
oh,
but...
but
being...
not
being
able
to
read
at
all...
i
mean,
i
cannot
read
without
reading
glasses,
and
i
would
not
be
able
to
function
in
this
job
or
in
any
job
i've
ever
had.
you
know,
i've
been
a
teacher.
i've
been...
all
jobs
that
required
reading.
now,
there
are
a
lot
of
americans
like
that
whose
job
requires
reading,
maybe
100
million.
100
million
anyway.
are
they
all
covered
by
the
americans
with
disabilities
act?
unknown
speaker
if
you
have
substantial
limitation--
--what's
your
answer
to
the
question?
--that's
on
a...
on
a
case-by-case
basis,
that
seems
to
contradict
the
finding
of
and
the
purpose
of
congress
which
is
to
say
there
is
a
discrete
and
insular
minority
here
who
are
subjected
to
stigmatizing
treatment
in
society.
that
whole
concept
seems
to
drop
out
of
your
reading
of...
of
the
statute.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
think
one
of
the
things
that's
bothering
the
court
is
that
we
assume
that
a
significant
number
of
legislators
and
congressmen
had
severe
myopia
and
we
can't
imagine
that
they
thought
they
were
disabled
when
they
enacted
this
law.
i
think
that's
something
that's
in
the
back
of...
of
our
minds
as
we're
asking
these...
these
questions
today
and
yesterday.
unknown
speaker
well,
were
they
regarded
as
limited
in
their
ability
to
do
a
single
job,
to
wit,
as
a
pilot
for
united?
unknown
speaker
well,
a
class
of
jobs
for
united?
they...
they
were
working
as
regional
airline
pilots,
were
they
not?
unknown
speaker
are
they
still?
unknown
speaker
so,
what
we're
dealing
with
here
is
a
specific
job
as
pilot
for
united,
are
we
not?
unknown
speaker
well,
i'm
looking
at
eeoc's
regulation
which
attempts
to
define
whether
one
is
substantially
limited
in
the
major
life
activity
of
working,
and
it
says,
the
inability
to
perform
a
single,
particular
job
does
not
constitute
a
substantial
limitation
in
the
major
life
activity
of
working.
is
that
what
we
have
here?
unknown
speaker
so,
that's
not
your
claim
and
that's
not
the...
the
complaint.
unknown
speaker
it...
it
is
instead
a
substantial
limitation
on
the
ability
to
see?
is
that...
or
what
is
it?
would
you
explain?
unknown
speaker
well,
but
on
the
regarded
as
prong,
it
again
is
related
to
a
single,
particular
job,
pilot
for
united.
unknown
speaker
well,
the
only
job
applied
for
was
pilot
for
united.
now,
is
that
a...
a
single
job
within
the
meaning
of
the
eeoc
reg?
unknown
speaker
well,
the
question
isn't
what
united
barred
them
from.
the
question
is
how
did
united
regard
them.
unknown
speaker
did
united
regard
them
as
unemployable
by
any
major
airline?
it
certainly
didn't.
united
acknowledged
all
through
this
that
we
have
set
higher
standards.
how
can
you
say
that
united
regarded
them
as
disabled
in
that
meaning?
unknown
speaker
oh,
sure.
sure,
it
could.
i
mean,
somebody
would...
would
turn
someone
down
who
has
hiv,
for
example,
and...
and
because
of
the...
what...
what
is
the
phrase
that's
used
in
connection
with
the
regarded
as
clause?
because
of
myths
and
shibboleths?
no,
it
isn't
shibboleths.
what...
there's--
--stereotypes.
stereotypes
is
the
word.
[laughter]
because
of
myths
and
stereotypes,
united
thinks
that
a...
that
a
person
with
hiv
can't
function
either
at
united
or
anywhere
else,
and
then
bang,
you
have
them
for
regarding
you
as
being
disabled
even
though
you're
not
disabled.
but
this
is
not
that
case.
united
says,
you
know,
you're
welcome
to
go
to
other
airlines,
but
we're
a
cut
above
other
airlines.
we
hire
people
only
with
really
good
vision.
unknown
speaker
well,
if
they
could,
it'd
be
hard
to
convince
a
jury
of
that,
but...
but
if
they
did
have
that
view,
they
wouldn't
be
regarding
you
as
disabled.
they'd
be
regarding
you
as
just
not
good
enough
for
united.
unknown
speaker
wasn't
there--
--you...
you
told
me
before,
though,
that
you
were
not
relying
on
the
major
life
activity
of
working.
are
you
or
aren't
you?
i'm
confused.
unknown
speaker
for
positions
that
united--
unknown
speaker
--well,
they
have
other
jobs
too
presumably.
unknown
speaker
what
do
you--
--your...
your
opponents
claim
that...
that
below,
and
until
you
got
to
this
court,
your
claim
of
regarding
the
job
category
was
not
all
airline
pilots,
but
only
pilots
for
global
airlines.
unknown
speaker
is
that...
that
is
correct.
unknown
speaker
suppose
the
employer's
point
of
view
is
the
reason
i
don't
accept
this
corrective
is
this
is
a
risky
business.
glasses
can
be
broken.
contact
lenses
can
be
lost.
glasses
can
become
foggy
at
an
urgent
moment.
under
which
notch
would
that
defense
fit?
unknown
speaker
that's
for
the
employer
to
show;
whereas,
basic
qualification
is
for
the
would-be
employee
to
show?
unknown
speaker
thank
you,
mr.
hughes.
mr.
kneedler,
we'll
hear
from
you.
unknown
speaker
say
again
what
you
conceive
the
anomaly
to
be,
mr.
kneedler.
unknown
speaker
speak
kind
of
a
little
bit
slower.
unknown
speaker
do
you
think...
do
you
think
that
the
statute
should
be
interpreted
so
that
it
depends
on
how
the
particular
employer
looks
at
the
applicant?
in
case
one,
if
the
employer
looks
at
the
applicant
in
the
uncorrected
state,
the
act
applies
there?
if
it
looks
at
it
in
the
corrected
state,
the
act
applies
there?
unknown
speaker
all
right.
then...
then
united
can't
really
be
chastised
for
creating
an
anomaly.
all...
all
it's
saying
is
that
the
act
means
one
thing
or
the
other.
unknown
speaker
how
about
the
43
million
figure?
unknown
speaker
well,
but
43
million
is
in
there
as
a
fact.
unknown
speaker
but
where
do
you
get
that
out
of
the
statute,
that--
unknown
speaker
--yes,
but
it
doesn't
answer
whether
you
view
it
corrected
or
uncorrected.
i
mean--
unknown
speaker
--it
just
is
not
apparent
from
the
face
of
the
statute--
unknown
speaker
--that
we
wouldn't
look
at
the
corrected--
unknown
speaker
--vision.
unknown
speaker
if
you
use...
what's
worrying
is
if
you
say
it
should
be
uncorrected.
unknown
speaker
and
then
you
read
out
of
the
statute
people
who
have
glasses
like
this.
i
borrowed
them
from
justice
scalia.
[laughter]
but
i
need
them
too.
that's
not
true.
i
need
them
too.
and
i
couldn't
function
without
them.
all
right.
now,
are
you
reading
all
people
like
me
out
of
the
statute?
well,
what's
the
answer?
unknown
speaker
all
right.
now--
unknown
speaker
--now
take
a
person
just
like
me
except
that
person
has
the
same
vision
i
have
without
glasses
with
glasses.
that
person
is
now
read
out
of
the
statute
too.
unknown
speaker
he
can't
wear
glasses.
unknown
speaker
he
has
a
defect
because
he
can't
wear
glasses.
there
are
a
lot
of
people
who
could
be
like
that.
unknown
speaker
and
wouldn't
those
people
be
handicapped?
unknown
speaker
disabled.
unknown
speaker
but
i
don't
know
all
the
disabilities
in
the
world,
and
it
might
be
that
people
are
disabled
in
ways
where
most
people
can
correct,
but
they
can't.
unknown
speaker
and
now
i'm
concerned
about
what
your
definition
will
do
to
those
people.
unknown
speaker
why
doesn't
the
regarded
as
prong
serve
as
the
backdrop
and
so
you...
you
have
no
problem
looking
at
the
corrected
condition
of
the
person?
unknown
speaker
what's
the
difference
between
treated
as
and
regarded
as?
unknown
speaker
well,
that's
not
true
for
that
entire
class.
the
example
given
in
one
of
the
briefs
in
these...
in
these
cases
of,
you
know,
ted
williams
had...
had
20/10
vision
in
both
eyes
and
a...
you
know,
a
ball
club
manager
has
a
perfectly
good
outfielder
whom...
whom
he
could
have
played
instead
of
ted
williams,
but
he
chooses
ted
williams.
unknown
speaker
and
this
other...
this
other
person
is
very
good
and
could
well
be
fine
in
another
team.
now,
because
he
chooses
ted
williams
and
rejects
the
other
fellow
because
he
has
only
20/30,
does
that
mean
he's
treating
the
other...
the
other
fellow
as
disabled?
i
think
that's
ridiculous.
unknown
speaker
no.
this
is
a
manner...
this
is
a
manager
who
plays
the
odds.
it's
when
ted
was
on
the
way
up.
[laughter]
ted
was
on
the
way
up.
nobody
knew
how
great
he
was
at
the
time.
unknown
speaker
you
know
the
way
managers
play
the
odds.
unknown
speaker
they'll
put
in
a
left-hand
batter
and
all
of
that.
unknown
speaker
he's
not.
he's...
that's
just
absurd.
it's
just
simply
not
true.
i
want
ted
williams.
i'm
not
saying
this
other...
this
other
fellow
isn't
a
perfectly
good
ball
player,
but
if
i
have
an
opportunity
to
get
ted,
i'm
going
to
take
ted.
i'm
going
to
turn
this
guy
down.
unknown
speaker
just
certain
airplanes,
global--
unknown
speaker
--piloting
positions.
unknown
speaker
any...
any
airplane.
unknown
speaker
even
though
they
were,
in
fact,
at
the
time
pilots
of
a
regional--
unknown
speaker
--and
that
was
the
allegation.
unknown
speaker
so,
you
say
a
motion
to
dismiss
should
not
have
been
granted.
unknown
speaker
and
the
regulation
says
the
inability
to
perform
a
single,
particular
job,
to
wit,
a
pilot
for
united--
unknown
speaker
--is
not--
unknown
speaker
--a
substantial
limitation
on
work.
unknown
speaker
so,
for
purposes
of...
of
the
reg,
you
assume
that
every
other
airline
will
do
exactly
what
this
airline
is
doing
for
determining
whether
you
meet
the
class
criterion.
is
that--
unknown
speaker
--what
happens
to
myths
and
stereotypes?
what
happens
to
myths
and
stereotypes,
which
was
supposed
to
be
the
whole
purpose
of
this
provision?
unknown
speaker
it
isn't
the
driving
force
at
all.
united
knows
very
well
that
other
airlines
don't
apply
this
standard.
they're
not
following
any
myth.
they're
just
saying,
we
want
to
higher
standard.
unknown
speaker
that's
not
a
stereotype
to
say
that
i
don't
like
this
particular
type
of
thing.
a
stereotype
is...
is
a
view
that,
you
know,
a
lot
of
people
have,
and
if...
if
united
had
said,
you
know,
all
airlines
regard
you
that
way,
it
would
be
something
else.
thank
you,
mr.
kneedler.
mr.
englert,
we'll
hear
from
you.
unknown
speaker
do
we
owe
deference
to
the
eeoc
on
this
point
of
how
you
view
it?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
and
why
not?
unknown
speaker
what
was
the
status
of
that
prior
case,
the
kienast
case,
in
1990?
was
that...
did
the
eeoc
ever
explain
why
it
was
rejecting
the
position
that
it
took
in
that
early
case?
unknown
speaker
would
it
make
sense...
earlier
this
term
we
decided
a
case
involving
a
handicapped
child.
you
know
the
one
i'm
thinking
of.
unknown
speaker
cedar
rapids.
unknown
speaker
and
i
think
in
there
we
had
some
language
in
respect
to
the
agency
might
want
to
deal
with
this
and
fully
consider
it
and
so
forth.
would
that
make
sense
here
on
the
question
of
when
or
whether
you
take
corrected
or
uncorrected
into
account?
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
it
doesn't
say
whether
corrected
or
uncorrected
or
whether
corrected
always
or
some
circumstances.
unknown
speaker
all
right.
if
we
get
by
the
present
indicative
problem,
you
see,
i
would
be
concerned
in
terms
of
the
statute
of
many
people
who
might
have
prosthetic
limbs,
who
might
be
taking
enormous
amounts
of
medicine,
who
might...
you
know--
unknown
speaker
--be
the
very
victims
of
the
prejudice
and
myth
that
the
statute
is
aimed
at.
unknown
speaker
and...
and
they
wouldn't
even
get
in
the
door.
unknown
speaker
it
would
produce
enormous
litigation
on
that
point,
and
this
is
an
unusual
statute
i
take
it;
whereas,
our
other
discrimination
statutes
are
open
to
everyone
to
come
in
and
say
i'm
discriminated...
i
am
a
member
of
the
protected
class
discriminated
against,
and
you
know,
i'm
black,
i'm
a
woman.
i'm
discriminated
against
unjustifiably.
unknown
speaker
here
you
don't
get
in
the
door.
unknown
speaker
you
go
ahead.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
this...
this
is
what
i'm...
this
is
the
question
i'm
trying
to
get
to,
which
is
think
of
the
44
million.
if
i
say
44
or
43
million,
that
calls
a
whole
argument
to
mind.
unknown
speaker
the
following
occurred
to
me,
that
if
you
open
the
door
to
the
myopic
people
by
looking
only
at
uncorrected
state,
100
million
people
will
not
walk
through
that
door.
hardly
anyone
will
walk
through
that
door,
and
the
reason
that
hardly
anyone
will
walk
through
that
door
is
that
discrimination
against
people
who
are
easily
correctable
rarely
exists.
a
handful
of
employers
take
things
like
that
into
account.
so,
it
isn't
opening
the
statute
to
150
million
people.
it
is
opening
the
statute
to
43
million
people,
plus
10,000--
unknown
speaker
--or
a
few
thousand,
or
at
most
a
million.
and
therefore,
it
is
totally
consistent--
unknown
speaker
--with
the
legislative
history
to
look
at
uncorrected
state.
all
right.
that's
my
question.
unknown
speaker
mr.
englert,
can
i
get
back
to
deference
to
eeoc?
i'm...
i'm
not
persuaded
by
the
two
reasons
you
gave
for
not
giving
deference.
one
is
that
they've
changed
their
position.
so
what.
i
mean,
in
the
old
days,
you
know,
before
chevron
we
used
to
put
great
weight
upon
a
change
in
position,
but
i
thought
that
we
said
in
a
number
of
cases
the...
i
mean,
that's...
that's
why
you
elect
different
presidents
because
there's
a
lot
of
wiggle
room
in
the
statutes
and
each
administration
is...
is
entitled
to
wiggle
the
way
it
wants
to
wiggle
so
long
as
it's
within
the
scope
of
the
ambiguity
contained
in
the
statute.
unknown
speaker
that's
true.
unknown
speaker
that's
a
different
argument.
unknown
speaker
why?
why...
why
not--
unknown
speaker
--why
not
chevron
deference?
unknown
speaker
what
was
the
date
of
general
electric?
unknown
speaker
yes.
i
mean,
that's
old,
old
stuff.
i
don't
even
know
skidmore
deference
anymore.
it's
not
that
old.
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
why?
unknown
speaker
we
give
deference
to
agencies
who
have...
who...
whose
position
is
not
enunciated
except
in
litigation
so
long
as
it
wasn't
made
up
for
this
particular
case.
unknown
speaker
if
an
agency
has...
has
consistently
taken
a
certain
position
in...
in
legislation,
we've
given
deference
to
it.
unknown
speaker
what
a
wonderful
world
this
is.
unknown
speaker
there
are
all
sorts
of
gradations?
i
mean,
if
i
accept
that
argument
from
you,
i'm
going
to
accept
the
argument
about,
you
know,
all
different
levels
of
myopia
that...
that
your
opponent
makes.
it's
about
just
as
imaginative.
unknown
speaker
bragdon
certainly
suggests...
last
term
talks
both
about
skidmore
deference
and
about
chevron
deference,
does
it
not?
unknown
speaker
mr.
englert,
even
if
we
were
to
agree
with
you,
that
you
look
at
vision
in
its
corrected
state
under
the
statute,
there
is
a
regarded
as
feature
of
the
statute.
and
this
case
was
resolved
on
a
motion
to
dismiss,
and
was
there
no
allegation
that
the
respondent
regarded
the
petitioners
as
disabled?
unknown
speaker
where...
where
do
you
want
us
to
look?
unknown
speaker
well,
but
in
d,
they
allege
that
united...
its
position
is
based
on
stereotype,
myth,
or
unsubstantiated
fears,
that
they
have
no
data
or
evidence
indicating
that
the
plaintiffs'
visual
acuity
and
use
of
corrective
lenses
presents
safety
concerns.
unknown
speaker
i
mean,
that's...
that's
also
alleged,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
we
don't
require
that
much
on
a
motion
to
dismiss--
unknown
speaker
--on
the
face
of
a
complaint.
unknown
speaker
that's
exactly
what's
bothering
me,
that
if...
you
might
be
right.
if
you
are
right,
then
the
regarded
as
prong
is
not
really
going
to
be
a
way
to
get
a
lot
of
disabled
people
in
the
door,
and
if
you
are
right
on
that,
then
when
you
look
to
the
first
prong,
there
might
be
a
lot
of
deaf
people,
for
example,
deaf
people
with
hearing
aids,
who
just
can't
even
get
through
the
door
because
they
will
be
said,
well,
you're
not
disabled
because
that
hearing
aid
works
well
enough.
and
then
met
with
totally
irrational,
say,
reaction
on
the
part
of
some
other
employer,
they
will
then
lose
because
that
employer
just
regarded
them
as
not
good
enough
to
work
here,
but
perfectly
good
enough
to
work
somewhere
else.
unknown
speaker
and
it's
that
kind
of
interpretation
possibly
that's
worrying
the
eeoc.
unknown
speaker
well,
how...
how
do
you
read
this
regarded
as
prong?
i
mean,
they've
alleged
that
united's
position
is
based
on
stereotype,
myth,
or
unsubstantiated
fears,
and
that
it
blocks
plaintiffs
from
an
entire
class
of
employment
and
so
on.
now,
how
could
they
have
been
more
specific
in
their
allegations?
this
is
a
motion
to
dismiss.
unknown
speaker
why
is
this
not
sufficient
under
the
regarded
as?
unknown
speaker
mr.
englert,
what
in
your
opinion
would
qualify?
what
would
be
an
example
of
something
that
would
be...
someone
who
would
be
regarded
as
disabled
by
an
employer?
unknown
speaker
well,
what
about
someone,
say,
who
has
an
artificial
leg
and...
but,
nonetheless,
is
perfectly
able
to
drive
and
can
drive
as
well
as...
meet
any
driving
test?
yet,
the...
the
employer
says,
you
know,
i
just
don't
want
to
take
a
chance
with
you.
is...
is
he
regarding
that
person
as
disabled?
unknown
speaker
well,
but
this...
this
thing
works
great
for
him.
i
mean,
he
can
do...
he
can
do...
he
passes
all
those
tests.
and
yet,
this
particular
employer
says,
well,
you
know,
i
know
you
do,
but
i...
i
just
want
really
grade
a
people,
not
meaning
any
disrespect
to
the
guy,
but
i
just
don't
want
to
take
a
chance.
unknown
speaker
supposing
i
have
an
artificial
finger
and
he's
afraid
i
can't
honk
the
horn.
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
so
that
there
wouldn't...
wouldn't
be
any
obvious
major
disability.
unknown
speaker
yes,
and
particularly
in...
in
this
case,
one
of
the
stumbling
blocks
is
that
united
did
treat
the
applicant
in
its
uncorrected
condition
for
the
regarded
as
prong.
it
regarded
these
people
as
being
uncorrected.
unknown
speaker
that's...
that's
the
next
question,
but
you...
you
admit
that
it,
of
course,
regarded
them
in
their
uncorrected
state.
unknown
speaker
well,
this
whole
act
is
metaphysical.
we've
been
here
for
2
days.
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
okay,
but
let's
take
this
case.
they...
they
are
corrected...
in
their
uncorrected,
they're
20
over
100.
with
glasses,
they're
20/20.
and
united
says
you
aren't
disabled
because
when
you
wear
glasses,
you're
20/20,
and
then
they
say
we
don't...
but
when
we
regard
you
as
eligible
for
the
job,
we're
not
going
to
take
you
because
you're
actually
20
over
100.
why
isn't
that
regarding
them
as
disabled?
i
think
that's
the
problem
we're
having
with
your
position.
unknown
speaker
well,
we
didn't
take
that
question
here
in
this
case,
did
we?
the
single
job
issue
or
not?
unknown
speaker
may...
may
i
ask
in
that
connection
if
the...
if
the
evidence
or
the
allegation
was
that
united
is
just
like
10
different...
all
10
major
airlines
have
the
same
rule.
would...
would
then
it
satisfy
the
regarded
as
job
classification
for
you?
unknown
speaker
you
don't
think
being
ineligible
for...
an
otherwise
qualified
pilot
being
denied
the
opportunity
to
work
as
a
pilot
for
the...
all
the
blue
ribbon
airlines
would
be
a...
disabling
in
a
major
life
activity?
unknown
speaker
didn't
you
quote
a
reg
more
or
less
supporting
your
position?
what
is
it...
can
i
just
finish
this
for
a
second?
no.
i'm
sorry.
what
is
it?
they
have
to
be...
no
airline
at
all
would
hire
them?
is
that
your
view?
unknown
speaker
it's
sort
of
a
market
share
antitrust
test?
is
this
what
it
is?
or
how...
how
do
you
define
the...
when
it's
enough
in
your
view?
i
just
want
to
get
your
position.
unknown
speaker
well,
the
class
of
jobs--
unknown
speaker
--is
being
a
pilot
for
all
major
airlines.
unknown
speaker
i'm
not...
i'm
interested
in
your
view.
i'm
trying
to
understand
your
position.
unknown
speaker
but
you
want
us--
--so,
it
has
to
be
every
airline.
you
want
us
to
defer
to
eeoc
interpretive
guidelines
on
this--
unknown
speaker
--but
not
on
the
other.
it
comes
from
the
same
interpretive
guideline.
unknown
speaker
mr.
englert,
are
these--
--how
much
broader
would
it
have
to
be?
you
say
at
some
point
just
everybody
thinking
he's
too
short
does...
does
constitute
regarded
as.
it's
just
not
hiring
in
the
nfl.
what
else
is
it?
i
mean--
unknown
speaker
--but
what
if
all...
all
professional
football...
all
professional
football
leagues
though
he
was
too
short?
unknown
speaker
well--
unknown
speaker
--like
saying
putative
pilots
could
gas
planes.
they
could
but
that's
not
what
they're
trained
for.
unknown
speaker
can
we
go
back
to
eyesight
and
this
simpleminded
view
of
it,
without
getting
into
categories
of
jobs?
do
you
agree
that
these
plaintiffs
without
their
glasses
would
fit
the
definition
substantially...
what
is
it...
restricted
or
limited
with
regard
to
sight?
they
can't
see
in
front
of
them
without
their
glasses.
would...
just
let's
take
them
in
their
uncorrected
state.
are
they...
do
they
fit
the
definition
of
being
disabled?
unknown
speaker
yes,
well,
it
is
functionally.
they
can't
do
anything.
they
can't
see
in
front
of
them.
it
isn't
safe
for
them
to
go
out
on
the
street.
let's...
but
this...
this
is
my
basic
problem
and
it's
been
brought
up
in...
in
the
briefs.
you
take
this
person
in
their
corrected
state
on
your
analysis,
but
then
the
employer
says,
i
don't
accept
the
correction.
in
other
words,
the
question
i
asked
mr.
kilberg
yesterday
i
think,
if
these
women
had
had
laser
surgery
so
that
they
could
be
20/20,
that
would
be
a
corrective
that
united
air
lines
would
accept.
but
isn't
it
the
case
that
what's
really
going
on
here
is
they
are
disabled
if
their
correction
is
not
accepted
and
united
is
not
accepting
the
correction?
unknown
speaker
that's
why
i
mean
to
get
into
it.
i
say,
as
they
are...
from
the
employer's
point
of
view,
people
who
don't
have
glasses
to
correct
their
vision--
unknown
speaker
--all
right,
but...
what...
it
seems
to...
what
your
argument
is
driven
by
and
what
your
answer
to
justice
ginsburg
is
driven
by
is
you
want
to
make
sure
that,
at
the
end
of
the
day,
united
is
in
a
position
to
hold
out,
for
very
good
reason,
for
what
it
believes
is
the
very
safest
pilot
regardless
of
what
these
definitions
may
be.
you
want
the
airline
to
be
in
the
position
of
saying
if
there's
a
400
hitter
out
there,
i
don't
have
to
hire
the
200
hitter.
but
isn't
it
the
case
that
the
airline
would
be
in
the
position
to
hold
out
for
the
best,
just
as
you
want
it
to
do,
even
if
we
take
your...
your
opponent's
view
of
regarded
and
get
these
people
in
under
the
statute,
because
if
holding
out
for
the
very
safest,
the
400
hitter
of
airline
pilots,
is
in
fact
a...
a
reasonable
qualification
for
an
airline
or
if
it
is
a
reasonable
approach
to
the...
to
the
safety
and
health
circuit
breaker
in
the
statute,
you'd
still
be
able
to
do
that
even
though
these
people
were
regarded
in
the
first
instance
for
getting
into
court
as...
as
being
disabled?
unknown
speaker
well,
it's...
you're
right.
the...
the
regs
refer...
i
think
they
finally
get
down
to
substantial
risk.
and...
and
you're
quite
right.
my
question
is
assuming
that
what
is
a
substantial
risk
is
a
function
not
only
of
the
likelihood
of
something
going
wrong,
but
the...
the
extent
of
disaster
if
something
does
go
wrong.
so,
you're
right.
i'm
assuming
that
on
that
criterion,
you...
you
would
have
a
reasonable
argument
for
holding
out
for
the...
for
the
400
hitter--
unknown
speaker
--may
i
ask
a
question
going
back
to
the
first
issue,
the
disability?
i
know
it's
not
an
eyeglass
hypothetical,
but
i've
been
thinking
about
it.
supposing
a
person
needs
a
drug
in
order
to...
to
avoid
whatever
the
uncorrected
condition
is.
he
has
to
take
a
pill
of
some
kind,
and
he
wants
to
be
a
truck
driver.
but
he
can't
afford
to
buy
the
pill.
do
you
look
at
him
as
uncorrected
or
corrected?
unknown
speaker
you
look
at
an
uncorrected
even
though
if
he
got
the
job,
he
then
would
be
able
to
pay
for
the
pill.
unknown
speaker
and
you
can
take
into
account
the
economics
of
the
particular
applicant
then.
unknown
speaker
does
a
reasonable
accommodation
require
that
you
buy
the
pills
or
by
the
eyeglasses?
unknown
speaker
if
these
pilots
don't...
didn't
have
their
glasses
at
the
time
they
applied
for
a
job...
they
had
just
been
broken.
they
couldn't
have...
they
hadn't
had
a
chance
to
make
an
appointment
with
the
eye
doctor.
they'd
be

is...
is
it...
do
we
have
the
only
choice?
if
we
accept
your
view
on
eyeglasses
corrected,
do
we
then
have
to
say
in
the
case
of
every
other
condition,
you
also
look
corrected,
or
is
there
an
intermediate
position?
unknown
speaker
what
would
be
the
best
intermediate
position?
unknown
speaker
what
in
particular
in
the
legislative
history
do
you
point
to?
because
i
said
yesterday
in
an
argument...
and
i
thought
i
was
right...
that
the
legislative
history
seems
to
point
in
each
direction.
the...
the
house
and
senate
judiciary
reports
don't
seem
to
be
very
clear
one
way
or
the
other.
my
recollection
is
that
the...
of
the
two
labor
reports,
one
favored
the
corrected
view,
one
favored
the
uncorrected
view.
what
do
you
point
to?
unknown
speaker
thank
you,
mr.
englert.
mr.
hughes,
you
have
a
minute
remaining.
unknown
speaker
why
does
that...
where...
how
do
you
get
that?
when
one
could
just...
there
wasn't
any
trial
here.
one
could
think
it
could
be.
they
think
glasses
fog
up.
they
get
lost.
contact
lenses
get
lost
all
the
time.
people
forget
to
take
pills.
that's
not
stereotype,
is
it?
unknown
speaker
thank
you,
mr.
hughes.
