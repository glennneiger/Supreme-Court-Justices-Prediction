mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
respondent
argues
that
although
it
made
its
employment
decision
precisely
on
the
basis
of
the
limitations
imposed
by
petitioners'
impairment
without
mitigating
measures,
the
ada
requires
a
court
to
ignore
those
very
same
limitations
and
look
only
to
petitioners'
ability
to
perform
with
corrective
measures.
we
submit
that
the
ada
does
not
require
that
anomalous
result.
the
agencies
charged
by
congress
with
implementing
and
interpreting
the
ada--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--the...
the
anomaly
in
this
case
is--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--i'm
sorry.
the
anomaly
is
that
respondent
united
made
its
decision
not
to
hire
the
petitioners
precisely
on
the
basis
of
their
uncorrected
vision,
but
they
are
claiming
that
the
ada
requires
a
court
to
look
only
at
their
vision
in
its
corrected
state.
and
we
believe
that...
that
is--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--no.
i'm
not...
i'm
not
submitting
that.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
no.
my...
my
only
point
is,
to
use
this
case
as
an
illustration
why
the...
why
it
makes
sense
for
the
act
to
look
to
the...
to
the
impairment
in
its
uncorrected
state,
that
has
been
the
interpretation
of
the
agencies
which
is
entitled
to
chevron
deference
under
this
court's
decision
in
bragdon.
and
that's
also
supported
by
the
text
of
the
act
which
only
mentions
the
impairment
and
the
substantial
limitations
that
flow
from
that
impairment.
there's
no
mention
of
mitigating
measures
and--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--the
43
million
figure,
your
honor...
there's
no
indication
what
congress
was
referring
to
when
it
looked
at
that.
when
one
traces
it
back...
and
the...
the
respondents...
or
petitioners'
reply
brief
addresses
this
in
some
detail.
you
trace
it
back
to
reports
of
the
national
council
on
disabilities,
pages
9
and
12
and
13--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--right,
right.
as
to
that
point,
we
are
certainly
not
saying
that
everyone
who
is
nearsighted
as
a
disability
under
the
act.
and
let
me
explain
why.
the...
the
statutory
phrase
is
whether
someone
is
substantially
limited,
and
the
way
that
the
implementing
regulation
sensibly
defines
substantially
limited
is
whether
the
individual
is
significantly
restricted
with
respect
to
that
major
life
activity
as
compared
to
the
average
person.
so,
it
is
necessary...
substantially
limited
is...
is
a
relative
point.
you
have
to
be
substantially
restricted
as
to
the
average
person.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
from...
from
the
phrase
substantially
limited.
in
order
to--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--no,
no.
i'm--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--i...
i
was
responding--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--no.
i
was
simply--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--responding
to
the
chief
justice's
point
that
43
million
speaks
to
that
question,
and
i
think
it
does...
does
not.
here
we
have
people
who
so
far
depart
from
the
norm
that
they
are
alleged
to
be
legally
blind.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
yes.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
and
our...
yes.
and
our--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--position--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
it...
it
depends.
that
person
might
have--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--that
person
may
have--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--that
person--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--that
person
may
have...
have
a--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--in...
in
that
particular
case,
but
that...
but
in
the
ordinary
case,
a
person
whose
vision
is
not
fully
corrected
to
20/20
may
have
a
very,
very
severe
uncorrected
impairment.
in
fact,
that
may...
that
may
well
be
the
more
common
situation.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
as
to
those
people,
certainly
if
an
employer
acts
on
the
basis
or...
or
anyone
else
covered
by
the
act
acts
on
the
basis...
treats
that
person
as
disabled,
then
the
regarded
as
prong
would...
would
protect
that
person
just
as...
as
it
alternatively
protects
that
person
here.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
the
regarded
as
prong,
properly
construed,
does
afford
a
great
deal
of
protection.
we're
not...
we're
not
disputing
that,
although
we
are
quite
concerned
about
the
manner
in
which
it
has
been
construed
by
the
lower
courts
and
the
way
it's
suggested
here.
and
if
i
could
just
address
that
for
a
moment,
just
to
make
sure
our
position
is
understood.
when
someone...
the
allegation
here
is
that
united...
and
the
regulatory
definition,
i
should
make
clear,
as
to
the
regarded
as
is
whether
the
person
is
treated
as
disabled
by
a
covered
entity,
treated
as
being
substantially
limited.
in
this
case
the
allegation
is--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
let
me
explain
perhaps
by
illustrating
in
this
very
case.
the
allegation
is
that
united
said
that
these
petitioners
are
not
qualified
for
any
piloting
position
with
united,
and
it
further
alleges
that
there
is
no
difference
between
united's
piloting
jobs
and
other
commercial
piloting
jobs.
so,
if
one
looks
at
the
class
of
piloting
jobs,
united
says,
as
to
those
people
within
that
class
who
we
employ,
you
are
not...
you
are
not
qualified.
therefore,
united
is
treating
them
as
disabled
for...
for
that
entire
class
of
piloting
jobs.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
first
of
all,
in
that
example,
i
think
the
manager
is
going
to
choose
the
person
who
hits
the
best
and
not
who
has
the
best
eyesight.
[laughter]
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
no,
but...
but--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--no,
but...
but--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--i'm...
i'm...
our
position
isn't...
isn't
that
it's
automatically
so,
but...
but
our
position
is
that
when
you
have
an
employer
who
has
jobs
that
we
have
to
take
as
a
given,
according
to
the
allegations
in
the
complaint,
are
the
same
as
piloting
jobs
elsewhere,
the
employer
is
essentially
necessarily
making
a
judgment
about
the
class
when
he's
making
a
judgment
about
the
particular
employees--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--this
came...
this
case
comes
up
on
a
motion
to
dismiss,
and...
and
certainly
it
is...
it
is
relevant
if
the
employer
is
making
a
judgment
about
what
is
safe
to
drive
an...
or
pilot
an
airplane,
which
is
what
this
employer
is
doing--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--no.
the
allegation
in
the
complaint--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--the
allegation
in
the
complaint
is
united
regarded
them
as
unable
to
drive
any...
pilot
any
airplane.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
any
airplane.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
the
regarded
as
looks
at
how
the...
what
particular
employer
treats
the
employee.
and
that
is
consistent
with--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--yes.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
yes.
no,
we're
certainly
not
saying
that
the...
that
the
record...
there
is
no
record...
establishes
that
the
plaintiffs
prevail
here.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
right.
it's--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--no.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
a
single
job
doesn't
mean
pilot
with
united.
what...
that's...
that's
elaborated
upon
in
the
explanatory
guidance
of
the
eeoc
which
serves
to
distinguish
between
a
specialized,
particular
job
and
a...
and
a
class
of
jobs.
and
it
doesn't
look
to
whether
it's
one...
a
job
with
one
employer
or
a
number
of
employers.
you
look
at
the
job
content.
you
may
have...
if
united
had
a
concorde
and
said,
you
can't
fly
the
concorde,
that
might...
that
would
be
the
sort
of
particular,
specialized
job
that
the
regulation
is
referring
to.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
in
general,
yes.
that's--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
that
is...
that
is
the
driving
force
behind
it,
but
that--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--it
is
following
a...
a
stereotype
in...
in
the
sense
that
united
is
saying
we
don't
regard
you,
treat
you
as
qualified
to
fly
our
airplanes
safely.
that
is...
or...
or
as
safely
as
we
would
like.
