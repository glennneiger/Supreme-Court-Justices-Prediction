mr.
van
aaron
hughes
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
because
this
matter
was
decided
by
the
lower
court
on
a
motion
to
dismiss,
for
purposes
of
today's
argument,
united
cannot
dispute
the
nature
of
the
discrimination
that
occurred
here.
petitioners
have
gone
to
great
lengths
to
make
themselves
eminently
qualified
to
fill
the
piloting
positions
at
issue
here,
but
were
excluded
from
those
positions
by
united
based
not
upon
their
actual
abilities,
but
based
only
upon
its
preconceived
notion
of
what
a
person
who
shares
their
impairment
can
and
cannot
do.
now,
united
contends
that
even
if
it
discriminated
in
just
this
manner,
it
cannot
be
liable
under
the
americans
with
disabilities
act
because,
as
a
matter
of
law,
the
ada
can
never
protect
one
with
severe
but
correctable
myopia.
united's
intuition
that
myopia
is
somehow
distinct
from
other
correctable
impairments
does
not
withstand
serious
scrutiny.
petitioners
here
are
actually
disabled
within
the
meaning
of
the
ada
or,
at
a
minimum,
they
were
regarded
as
disabled
with
respect
to
the
ability
to
work
by
united.
mr.
van
aaron
hughes
yes,
your
honor,
it
is.
mr.
van
aaron
hughes
the...
i
believe
it
was
the
third
question
presented
in
our
petition,
read
as
followed:
is
a
commercial
pilot
regarded
as
disabled
by
a
major
airline
that
refuses
to
employ
her
as
a
pilot
for
that
airline
due
to
her
poor
vision?
mr.
van
aaron
hughes
justice--
mr.
van
aaron
hughes
--i
agree,
justice
scalia,
that
there
are
more
than
43
million
americans
who
wear
glasses.
it
has
never
been
our
position
that
the
mere
fact
of
wearing
glasses
or,
indeed,
the
mere
use
of
any
corrective
measure
is
in
itself
a
disability.
our
position
is
that
congress
intended
not
to
identify
bright
line
categories
of
what
are
and
are
not
disabilities,
but
rather
to
require
courts
to
evaluate
the
severity
of
each
person's
impairment
on
a
case-by-case
basis.
mr.
van
aaron
hughes
the
statute--
mr.
van
aaron
hughes
--the
statute
requires
that...
that
each
impairment
be
substantially
limiting
with
respect
to
a
major
life
activity,
and
moreover,
the
definition
requires
a
substantial
limitation
of
the
major
life
activities
of
such
individual.
i
read
that
as
not
requiring
the
court
to
define
each
impairment
and
state
each
impairment
in
every
case
is
a
disability
or
is
not
a
disability.
that's
a
different
approach
that
congress
could
have
followed,
but
congress
didn't
follow
that...
that
approach.
congress
required
each
person's
impairment
to...
to
be
evaluated.
there
is
no
dispute
in
this
case--
mr.
van
aaron
hughes
--that's
correct.
the
substantial
limitation--
mr.
van
aaron
hughes
--that's
correct.
i
don't...
i
respectfully
disagree
that
putting
on
the
eyeglasses
as
the
substantial
limitation
is
identical
for
each
person
who
wears
eyeglasses.
the
substantial
limitation
is
that
some
persons
cannot
see
without
eyeglasses.
mr.
van
aaron
hughes
in
the
corrected
state,
that's
true.
they're
both
the
same,
just
as
any
person
who...
who
swallows
a
pill
once
a
day
and
is
able
to
function
by
taking
that
medication
is
in
the
same
boat.
but
it
does
make
a
difference
whether
you're
swallowing
the
pill
to
avoid
mild
headaches
in
the
afternoon
as
opposed
to
swallowing
the
pill
because
you
might
have
an
epileptic
seizure.
mr.
van
aaron
hughes
yes,
your
honor,
and
i'll
address
that
right
now.
our
reading
of
the
statute
is
that
the
inability
to
perform
a
major
life
activity
without
the
use
of
corrective
measures
is
itself
a
substantial
limitation.
now,
respondent
united
reads
the
statute
differently
and
says,
if
you
can
perform
the
major
life
activity
by
the
use
of
a
corrective
measure,
then
by
definition
you're
not
substantially
limited.
now,
those
are
two
alternative
readings
of
the
statute.
i
believe
this
court
has
already
gone
a
great
distance
toward
answering
that
question
in
bragdon
v.
abbott
when
this
court
instructed
that
the
act
deals
not
with
utter
inabilities
to
perform
a
major
life
activity,
but
substantial
limitations
on
that.
mr.
van
aaron
hughes
20...
20
over
100,
justice
ginsburg.
mr.
van
aaron
hughes
that's
correct.
and
some
persons
who
don't
have
perfect
vision,
20/20
vision,
may
not
even
be
impaired
if
they're
within
the
norm.
some
persons
will
be
impaired.
some
persons
will
be
impaired
but
not
substantially
limited.
mr.
van
aaron
hughes
i...
i
can't
say
that
as
a
matter
of
fact.
it
will
require
a
case-by-case
determination.
i
know
that
in
this
case
the
allegations
are
that
these
particular
plaintiffs
cannot
see
without
glasses.
united
has
conceded--
mr.
van
aaron
hughes
--congress
clearly
did
intend
to
draw
a
line
where
not
everyone
would
be
covered,
and
i
believe
substantial
limitation
requires
that
we
analyze
the
severity
of
each
person's
impairment.
i
know--
mr.
van
aaron
hughes
--as
far
as
whether
substantial
limitation
covers
the
job
market--
mr.
van
aaron
hughes
--that's
correct.
substantial--
mr.
van
aaron
hughes
--we're
at
the
point
of
having
to
analyze
on
a
case-by-case
basis
the
severity
of
each
person's
impairment
which
certainly
doesn't
create
the...
a
bright
line
test
that--
mr.
van
aaron
hughes
--you
judge
it
by
the
person's
ability
to
perform
that
life
activity.
here
we're...
we're
looking
at
seeing.
so--
mr.
van
aaron
hughes
--it's
not
judge
by
the
ability
to
perform
a
job,
unless
we're
talking
about
the
major
life
activity
of
working.
if
we're
talking
about
the
major
life
activity
of
seeing,
it's
judged
by
can
you
see,
can
you
do
the
things
that
a
person
with
normal
eyesight
can
do.
mr.
van
aaron
hughes
that
is
a
limitation.
it's
certainly
not
a
substantial
limitation.
mr.
van
aaron
hughes
well,
on
a
case-by-case--
mr.
van
aaron
hughes
--well,
because
i
believe
if
you
can
see
for
most
contexts,
if
there's
one
particular,
isolated
context
where
you
have
some
difficulty,
like
reading
a
menu
in
dim
light,
i
would
anticipate
that
a
court
would
not
find
that
to
be
a
substantial
limitation
on
your
ability
to
see.
mr.
van
aaron
hughes
the
inability
to
read
without
glasses
would
be
one
example
of
a
limitation
of
your
ability
to
see.
whether
that's
a
substantial
limitation
is
open
to
question.
mr.
van
aaron
hughes
i
don't...
i
don't
believe
so,
your
honor,
because
i
believe
that
the
number
of
people
who
honestly
can't
perform
life
activities
without
corrective
measures...
i
don't
assume
that
that's
a
staggering
number.
we'll
never
know
because
most
of
those
people
never
experience
discrimination.
and
certainly
this
case
does
not
violate
congress'
intentions
with
respect
to
the
ada.
mr.
van
aaron
hughes
i
don't
agree
with
that
for
two
reasons.
one
is
what
i've
attempted
to
articulate,
which
that...
is
i
think
the
severity
of
a
person's
impairment
is
critical
under
the
statute.
secondly,
this
is
a...
a
case
where
at
a
minimum
petitioners
were
regarded
as
being
limited
in
the
ability
to
work,
and
so
it's
difficult
for
me
to
conceive
that
this
isn't--
mr.
van
aaron
hughes
--i
don't
believe
so.
i
believe
they
were
limited
in
the
ability
to
perform
a
class
of
jobs,
all
of
the
jobs
requiring
the
same
skills,
training,
and
ability.
mr.
van
aaron
hughes
that's
correct,
justice
o'connor.
mr.
van
aaron
hughes
one
of
the
two
is
still
working
for
a
regional
airline,
yes.
mr.
van
aaron
hughes
no,
i
don't
believe
that's
the
case.
what
we're
dealing
with
is
specifically
united's
perceptions.
united's
perception
was
that
these
petitioners
were
unfit--
mr.
van
aaron
hughes
--your
honor,
with
respect
to
the
actually
disabled
prong,
which
is
what
that...
that
language
goes
to,
yes,
it
is
the
case
that
petitioners
are
not
actually
disabled
with
respect
to
the
ability
to
work
because
they're
able
to
work
in
other
positions
in
the
same
class
of
jobs.
mr.
van
aaron
hughes
that's
correct.
mr.
van
aaron
hughes
yes.
we
have...
we
have
two
independent
arguments.
one
is
that
we
were
actually...
that
my
clients
were
actually
substantially
limited
in
the
ability
to
see.
the
second
is
that
they
were
regarded
by
united
as
being
substantially
limited
in
the
ability
to
work.
and
in
the
regarded
as
prong,
it's
the
employer's
perceptions
that
are
at
issue.
that's--
mr.
van
aaron
hughes
--your
honor,
we're
not...
i
don't
believe
we're
talking
about
a
single
job.
if
united
had
said
you
can't
fill
this
position
or
these
particular
positions,
but
you
can
fill
these
other
positions,
that
would
be
a
different
example.
or
if--
mr.
van
aaron
hughes
--let's
not
misunderstand,
justice
o'connor.
we're
talking
about
thousands
of
jobs
at
united
within
the
entire
spectrum
of
the
relevant
class
of
jobs.
so,
united
barred
us...
barred
my
clients
from
all
such
jobs,
and
there's
no
distinction
between
united's
jobs
and
piloting
positions
with
any
other
airline.
mr.
van
aaron
hughes
that's
correct.
mr.
van
aaron
hughes
i
don't
believe
that
that's
the
appropriate
inquiry,
whether
united
recognized
that
there
might
be
other
employers
who
didn't
share
its
perceptions.
if
that
were
a
defense,
one
could
never
bring
a
claim
for
being
regarded
as
disabled--
mr.
van
aaron
hughes
--i
have
a
hard
time
understanding
why
united
couldn't
make
the
same
argument
in
that
case
and
simply
say,
we
have
a
high
physical
standard.
it
doesn't
include
people
who
are
hiv
positive,
but
other
airlines
will
hire
you.
so,
therefore,
we
aren't
regarding
you
as
disabled.
mr.
van
aaron
hughes
i
think
you're
right,
and
i
think
you've
put
your
finger
on
it,
that
you've
got
to
convince
a
jury
of
that.
this
is
a
factual
question
whether...
what
united's
perceptions
were,
how
united
applied
its
perceptions.
we've
alleged
that...
my
clients
have
alleged
that
they
are
not
limited
in
their
ability
to
perform
the
relevant
work,
but
that
united
believes
that
they
are,
that
there's
a
legitimate,
job-related
safety
requirement
that
prevents
them
from
being
airline
pilots,
not
just--
mr.
van
aaron
hughes
--we
are
relying
on
the
major
life
activity
of
working
with
respect
to
the
regarded
as
disabled
prong
of
the
disability
definition.
our
claim
and
our
allegations
are
that
united
perceived
these
two
people
to
be
unsuited
for
the
positions
of
flying
and
not
just
particular--
mr.
van
aaron
hughes
--well,
that's
all
that
united
could
do.
united
doesn't
have
the
power--
mr.
van
aaron
hughes
--certainly
united
has
administrative
positions
or
teaching
positions,
and
at
a
minimum
it's
an
issue
of
fact
whether
those
types
of
positions
involve
the
same
training,
skills,
and
abilities
as
piloting
positions.
and
i
don't
believe
one
could
say
that
a
person
who's
been
trained
to
be
a
pilot
is
limited...
is
not
limited
in
the
ability
to
work
if
they're
told
they
can't
be
a
pilot
any
more
than
one
who's
been
trained
to...
to
be
a
lawyer
is
not
limited
in
the
ability
to
work
if
they're
told
they
can't
practice
law.
mr.
van
aaron
hughes
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
van
aaron
hughes
we
stated
a
more
narrow
definition
of
the
relevant
class.
the
tenth
circuit
disagreed
and
defined
the
class
more
broadly.
we
accept
the
tenth
circuit's
definition
because
our
allegations
still
satisfy
that
definition.
with
the
court's--
mr.
van
aaron
hughes
--that
will
either
be
a
demonstration
of
a
job-related
requirement
or
a
direct
threat
to
safety.
either
of
those
would
be
a
factual
showing.
it's
contrary
to
our
allegations.
mr.
van
aaron
hughes
basic
qualifications
are
for
the
employee
to
show,
but
the...
the
employer
can
still
show
that
it
has
a
job-related
physical
standard.
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
van
aaron
hughes
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court:
mr.
englert's
statement
that
this
ultimately
is
a
safety
issue
speaks
volumes
about
what
is
at
issue
in
this
case.
this
court
held
in
arline
and
again
in
bragdon
that...
that
parties
must
produce
objective
evidence
as
to
whether
there
is
a
basis
for
a
safety
concern.
we've
alleged
that
united
perceives
my
clients
to
be
limited
in
the
ability
to
fly
any
aircraft,
whether
it's
piloting,
co-piloting,
passenger
routes,
courier
routes.
they
can't
do
any
of
it
under
united's
views.
many
other
employers
share
the
same
view.
not
all
employers.
if
they
all
shared
the
view,
we'd
have
a
good
claim
under
actually
disabled,
but
united
regards
as...
as
disabled
for
that
reason,
and
we've
alleged
that
there
is
no
basis
for
this
belief,
that
it's
based
purely
on
stereotype,
that
there
is
no
limitation
between...
there
is
no
relationship
between
uncorrected
vision
and
a
pilot's
safety.
the
faa
has
always
taken
the
same
view.
even
when
it
had
a
20/100
requirement,
one
could
obtain
a
waiver
if...
if
one's
vision
were
correctable.
and
it's
only
stereotype
that
states
otherwise,
and
whether
there's
a
basis--
mr.
van
aaron
hughes
--your
honor,
we've
alleged
that
it
is
and
we
believe
that's
so
because
the
objective
evidence
is
that
there
has
never
been
a
problem
associated
with
pilots
with
correctable
vision.
united
apparently
believes
the
same.
our
understanding
is
they
have
pilots
in
their
own
fleet
with
the
same
vision.
mr.
van
aaron
hughes
thank
you
very
much.
