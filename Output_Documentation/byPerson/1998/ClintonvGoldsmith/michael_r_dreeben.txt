mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
armed
forces,
in
this
case,
declared
unconstitutional
the
president's
power
to
drop
from
the
rolls
of
the
military
an
officer
who
had
been
convicted
in
a
court-martial
proceeding,
sentenced
to
more
than
6
months
of
confinement,
and
who
had
served
more
than
6
months
of
confinement.
our
submission
is
that
this
judgment
should
be
reversed
for
two
reasons:
first,
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
armed
forces
lacked
jurisdiction
to
use
power
under
the
all
writs
act
to
reach
the
action
to
drop
him,
major
goldsmith,
from
the
rolls
and
to
declare
the
statute
under
which
he
was
dropped
unconstitutional.
and,
second,
the
statutory
power
of
the
president
to
drop
an
officer
from
the
rolls
is
not
a
punitive
criminal
measure
that
implicates
the
protections
of
the
double
jeopardy
clause
or
of
the
ex
post
facto
clause.
now,
the
jurisdictional
question
involves
a
consideration
of
what
powers
congress
gave
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
armed
forces
in
reviewing
court-martial
judgments
which
consist
of
findings
and
sentences.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
armed
forces
is
given
a
specifically
defined
jurisdiction
to
review
the
results
in
court-martial
cases
when
particular
sentences
have
been
entered
and
the
judgment
below
has
been
reviewed
by
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
for
the
relevant
service.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
armed
forces
is
not
given
free-ranging
jurisdiction
over
all
matters
that
might
have
something
to
do
with
military
justice
or
that
might
implicate
matters
affecting
service
members
who
have
been
sentenced
under
the
uniform
code
for
military
justice,
the
ucmj.
rather,
congress
has
specially
allocated
powers
elsewhere
within
the
military
to
consider
personnel
actions
that
might
be
viewed
as
collateral
consequences--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--justice
o'connor,
major
goldsmith
had
three
avenues
essen...
essentially,
in
which
he
could
raise
his
claim.
the
first,
which
he
availed
himself
of,
would
be
to
raise
it
before
the
military
itself,
the
secretary
of
the
air
force,
in
response
to
the
notice
that
he
received
that
action
was
being
considered
to
drop
him
from
the
rolls.
so
he
could
present
that
claim
to
the
agency,
which
in
this
case
he
in
fact
did,
along
with
a
myriad
of
other
reasons,
both
equitable
and
statutory,
why
he
claimed
he
should
not
be
dropped
from
the
rolls.
if
the
secretary
of
the
air
force
does
indeed
finalize
an
action
to
drop
him
from
the
rolls...
which
has
not
happened
in
this
case...
he
can
present
a
claim
to
the
board
of
correction
of
military
records,
which
is
a
civilian
body
within
the
military
service,
and
has
the
power
to
correct
military
records
or
to
relieve
injustice.
and
he
can,
before
that
body,
make
a
claim
that
his
action...
to
drop
him
from
the
rolls...
is
constitutionally
barred
or
otherwise
improper.
and
most
importantly
here,
he
has
recourse
to
the
federal
district
courts
to
make
a
claim
that
the
action
to
drop
him
from
the
rolls
would
violate
the
constitution.
there
are
two
different
avenues
that
he
could
avail
himself
of.
one
would
be
an
action
under
the
administrative
procedure
act
in
a
court
that
had
proper
venue
and
jurisdiction
to
hear
that
claim,
and
he
could
challenge
the
action...
dropping
him
from
the
rolls...
claiming
that
it
violated
his
constitutional
rights.
he
could
even,
if
he
had
a
claim
that
he
might
suffer
some
irreparable
injury
from
the
action,
seek
injunctive
relief
that
would
bar
the
finalization
of
the
action,
provided
he
could
make
the
normal
equitable
showings
that
go
along
with
that.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
yes,
chief
justice
rehnquist.
after
the
conviction
has
been
finally
reviewed
within
the
military
system,
and
the
servicemember
has
exhausted
other
avenues
that
are
provided
under
the
ucmj
to
attempt
to
get
relief
from
the
conviction,
he
can
then
bring
a
habeas
corpus
action
under
the
standard
section
governing
habeas
corpus,
section
2241
of
title
28,
and
argue
that
his
conviction
is
affected
by
a
fundamental
defect
that
requires
that
it
be
set
aside.
in
this
case,
of
course,
major
goldsmith
is
not
challenging
his
underlying
conviction.
he
is
raising
a
claim
that
the
action
to
drop
him
from
the
rolls
is,
in
effect,
another
criminal
punishment,
because
it
was
enacted
after
the
time
that
he
committed
his
offenses,
violates
the
ex
post
facto
clause,
and
because
it
is
being
imposed,
or
might
be
imposed,
after
his
conviction
has
become
final,
violates
the
double
jeopardy
clause.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
justice
ginsburg,
we
don't
dispute
that
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
armed
forces
has,
in
appropriate
circumstances,
the
power
to
rely
on
the
all
writs
act.
but
the
all
writs
act
itself
is
not
generally
available
to
do
service
when
there
are
other
provided
statutory
means
of
accomplishing
the
end
in
question.
here,
the
standard,
typical
means
of
raising
any
kind
of
a
double
jeopardy
defense
is
to
set
up
that
defense
as
against
the
action
that
is
brought
against
you.
and
so
long
as
there
are
adequate
means
of
raising
that
claim,
there
can
be
no
warrant
for
using
the
all
writs
act
to
circumvent
the
specifically
provided
means
that
congress
has
allowed
for
the
raising
of
this
claim.
the
all
writs
act
is
an
equitable
power.
if
there
is
an
adequate
remedy
at
law,
there
can
be
no
resort
to
equity.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
the
bcmr,
the
board
of
correction
for
military
records,
is
an
optional
administrative
procedure.
it's
significant
here
because
it
signifies
that
that
is
where
congress
intended
that
servicemembers
go,
within
the
military,
to
obtain
relief
from
adverse
personnel
actions.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
i'm
not
entirely
sure,
chief
justice
rehnquist.
it
does
have
broad-ranging
authority
to
consider
claims
that
servicemembers
might
make,
arising
from
any
aspect
of
their
military
record.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
apa--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--that's
right.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
you
do
not
have
to,
justice
kennedy.
you
can
go
to
court
under
the
apa
and
challenge
the
final
agency
action
that
consists
of
dropping
the
officer
from
the
rolls.
you
can
also
go
to
the
board
of
correction
of
military
records
and
challenge
that
action
under
the
apa,
saying
that
the
bcmr
should
have
granted
relief.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
yes.
yes,
you
do.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
yes.
the
board's
action
itself
is
a
reviewable
agency
action.
there's
another
avenue
of
relief
here--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--yes.
bcmr
actions
are
often
reviewed
in
the
courts.
they're
most
typically
reviewed
under
the
guise
of
tucker
act
proceedings,
because
the
ultimate
challenge
here
is
that
the
servicemember
should
not
have
been
terminated
from
the
military,
which
causes
him
to
lose
military
pay
and
other
benefits.
and
those
claims
can
be
framed,
and
typically
are
framed,
as
claims
for
monetary
relief.
they're
brought
before
the
court
of
federal
claims.
they're
appealed
to
the
federal
circuit,
and
thereby
judicial
review
is
obtained
of
any
of
the
statutory,
regulatory,
or
constitutional
objections
that
the
servicemember
has.
now,
in
this--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--it
is
fairly
well-established,
justice
scalia,
for
two
different
reasons.
one
is
that,
under
the
tucker
act,
the
action
that
the
individual
is
challenging
is
being
fired.
and
if
he
is
dropped
from
the
rolls
or
otherwise
discharged
from
the
service,
that's
a
final
action.
it's
going
to
be
implemented.
it
is
not
going
to
be
stayed
or
delayed
in
any
respect
while
he
goes
to
the
board
of
corrections
of
military
records.
frequently,
service--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--that's
correct.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
that's
correct.
and
i
think
that
under
this
court's
decision
in
darby
v.
cisneros,
unless
there
is
a
specific
statutory
or
regulatory
requirement
of
exhaustion,
the
servicemember
need
not,
before
bringing
an
apa
action,
exhaust
a...
the
provided
administrative
remedy,
such
as
the
bcmr.
he
can
do
it,
but
he
can
also
make
a
challenge
to
the
actual
decision
to
drop
him
from
the
rolls.
if
he
is
going
to
sustain
such
an
action
under
the
apa,
he
has
to
be
able
to
show
that
something
more
is
at
stake
than
simply
the
money
that
he
would
have
been
received
if
he
had
not
been
dropped
from
the
rolls.
but
the
courts
have
generally
recognized
that,
through
one
avenue
or
another,
the
federal
courts
are
going
to
be
able
to
hear
and
adjudicate
the
very
constitutional
claim
that
major
goldsmith
presented
to
the
caaf.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
i
don't
think
you
do,
justice
breyer.
because
i
think
that
the
jurisdictional
question
is
fundamentally
an
allocation
of
power
within
the
military.
the
caaf
is
given
specific
designated
jurisdiction
to
review
court-martial
findings
and
sentences.
the
particular
challenged
action
at
issue
here...
dropping
from
the
rolls...
is
not
a
findings
or
sentence
that
can
be
imposed
in
a
court-martial
proceeding.
the
court-martial
is
in
fact
specifically
barred
from
dismissing
or
discharging
an
officer
except
as
in
accordance
with
the
ucmj.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
it
does
not
have
power
to
consider
dfr,
dropping
from
the
rolls,
actions.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
that...
that's
absolutely
correct.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
so--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--no.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
because
this
court's
jurisdiction
is
defined
to
review
certain
kinds
of
actions
that
are
taken
under
the
ucmj
by
the
court-martial
proceedings
itself.
an
officer
who
faces
the
kind
of
sanction
that
you've
described
has
another
method
of
recourse,
specifically
defined
by
statute.
within
the
military,
he
can
present
his
claim
to
the
secretary
of
the
air
force
or
the
relevant
service
secretary.
he
can
go
to
the
bcmr.
and
he
can
go
to
federal
district
court.
and
i
think
that
it's
important
that
in
thinking
of
the
jurisdictional
question
that
one
keep
in
mind
that
congress
set
up
the
caaf
and
the
subordinate,
intermediate
military
tribunals
for
very
important
but
specific
and
limited
purposes...
to
review
the
court-martial
sentences
that
have
been
presented
to
them
in
accordance
with
the
jurisdictional
statute.
there
is
no
free-ranging
power
given
to
these
bodies
to
review,
essentially,
personnel
actions
that
may
occur
as
a
collateral
consequence
of
the
conviction
or
other
consequences
that
may
occur
of
the
conviction.
and--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--no.
no
more
than
the
jurisdiction
of
a
criminal
sentencing
court
is
impaired
if
the
government
initiates
a
second
action
that
could
be
described
of...
as
violative
of
double
jeopardy.
the
original
judgment
stands.
and,
indeed,
it
still
has--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--yes.
and
there
would
be
a...
a
separate
question
raised
if
what
the
military
did
was
take
the
actual
court-martial
findings
and
sentence
and
specifically
revise
it,
and
increase
the
punishment,
contrary
to
the
specific
provisions
of
the
ucmj,
and
contrary
to
the
affirmed
judgment
of
the
appellate
court.
a
traditional
use
of
the
all
writs
act
power
would
be
to
compel
that
the
judgment
that
has
been
affirmed
and
adjudicated
in
a
particular
manner
be
adhered
to.
but
this
action
in
this
case
reached
beyond
the
judgment
and
beyond
the
terms
of
the
authorized
sentence,
and
enjoins
other
parties,
who
were
not
part
of
the
court-martial
proceeding,
per
se,
and
who
are
not
acting
under
the
ucmj,
and
who
are
not
acting
in
pursuance
of
the
judgment
of
conviction,
but,
rather,
are
exercising
separate
authority
altogether
to
take
an
officer
who
has
been
convicted
in
a
court-martial
and
get
him
out
of
the
air
force
as
a
result
of
that.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
there...
there
are
a
number
of
legal
and
practical
differences,
justice
ginsburg.
the
first
and
central
one
here
is
that
the
action
of
a
court-martial
in
dismissing
an
officer
is
considered
to
be
about
the
worst
punishment
that
a
court-martial
can
impose,
about
the
worst
punishment
that
can
be
experienced
by
an
officer.
it
carries
the
stigma
of
having
been
taken
out
of
the
military
service
as
a
punishment.
and
so
it
is
a
punitive
measure,
and
designed
to
be
perceived
as
such.
the
action
of
dropping
from
the
rolls,
in
contrast,
grew
up
from
the
history
of
a
law
in
the
18...
enacted
in
1870,
that
permitted
the
president
to
simply
recognize
that
if
an
officer
were
awol,
absent
without
leave,
and
not
serving
any
services
for
the
military,
not
performing
any
work
for
the
military,
he
could
be
simply
dropped
from
the
rolls
without
characterization
of
how
he
left
the
military.
a
dismissal
is
roughly
equivalent
to
a
dishonorable
discharge.
dropping
from
the
rolls
is
simply
a
removal
from
the
military
without
characterization
of
the
service
experience
at
all.
the
intermediate
form
of
administrative
remedy,
which
is
a
proceeding
under
section
1181,
is
more
broadly
available
for
misconduct
or
dereliction
of
duty
or
conduct
that
is
inconsistent
with
the
national
security.
and
it
entails
a
full-blown
due
process
hearing,
at
which
the
servicemember
can
present
to
the
armed
forces
reasons
why
he
should
not
be
dropped...
why
he
should
not
be
dismissed
from
the...
the
military
or
discharged
from
the
military.
and
it
can
carry
adverse
consequences,
adverse
characterizations,
for
the
servicemember
who
is
discharged.
so,
it
has
both
more
due
process,
more
potential
for
adverse
characterization,
than
dropping
from
the
rolls.
dropping
from
the
rolls
really
targets
a
very
narrow
category
of
servicemembers
who
have
been
convicted
of
serious
crimes
or
who
are
awol.
and
in
those
situations,
congress
has
deemed
it
to
be
a
sufficient
basis,
alone,
for
removing
that
person
as
a
serving
member
of
the
military.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
that
would
be
impossible,
because
the
sentencing
body
at
the
court-martial
level
would
not
know
whether
any
administrative
action
would
be
taken
later,
because--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--as
a...
as
a
practical
matter,
i
can't
say
that
the
court-martial
body
might
not
think
that.
but
it
would
have
no
more
relevance
to
the
legal
issues
here
than
it
would
have
if
a
sentencing
court
said
that
i'm
not
going
to
impose
a
certain
fine
on
you
because
i
anticipate
that
you're
going
to
be
fired
by
your
civilian
employer
once
this
criminal
conviction
is
made
final.
the
sentencing
judgment
that
is
imposed
by
the
court-martial,
and
ultimately
affirmed
or...
on
review,
is
simply
that
body's
sentence.
but
it
doesn't
give
the
courts
that
reviewed
that
sentence
the
power
to
enjoin
later
authorities
that
may
impose
collateral
consequences
as
a
result
of
the
sentence.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
no,
justice
souter.
i
may
have
misspoken.
but
i
meant
to
say
only
that
if
the
military
authorities
themselves
attempt
to
alter
the
judgment,
the
written
document
that
reflects
the
judgment,
and
attempt
to
impose
greater
punishment
than
has
been
affirmed
by
the
reviewing
court,
that
court
would
have
power
to
order
its
own
judgment
corrected.
post-sentence
administration
of
any
form
is
not
a
matter
that
is
given
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
armed
forces
to
have
jurisdiction
over.
it--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--it
depends
what
the
claim
is.
if
the
claim
is
that
the
servicemember
is
being
held
contrary
to
the
judgment,
the
servicemember
can
bring
a
habeas
corpus
action.
if
the
servicemember
claims
that
he
is
being
given
unconstitutional
punishment
in
violation
of
his
eighth
amendment
rights,
he
could
go
to
federal
district
court
and
bring
either
an
apa
action
or,
in
appropriate
circumstances,
maybe
a
bivens
action.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
he
would
probably
have
to
bring
a
tucker
act
action,
that's
right.
and,
again,
this
is
not
a
question
of...
of
unavailability
of
remedy.
it
is
a
question
of
allocation
of
remedy
over
who...
who
has
power
to
determine
how
the
military
acts
once
the
court-martial
sentence
has
been
finally
reviewed.
the
caaf
is
a
court
that
was
set
up
to
review
only
issues
of
law
arising
out
of
court-martial
proceedings
itself.
that
is
what
its
statutory
restriction
says
it
may
do.
and
its
judgments
are
then
reviewable
here
by
the
government
or
by
the
servicemember.
but
the
caaf
was
not
given
authority
to
become
an
all-powerful
administrator
of
criminal
judgments
that
it
has
once
affirmed.
those
actions
are
reviewable
under
other
forms
of
proceedings
entirely.
justice
breyer,
to
come
back
to
your
question,
i...
i
think
that
if
the
court
held
clearly,
as...
as
it
should,
that
the
dropping
from
the
rolls
procedure
is
a
civil
and
administrative
remedy,
that
would
reinforce
the
conclusion
that
it
could
not
possibly
be
a
matter
that
could
ever
come
before
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
armed
forces.
but
even
if
the
court
did
not
decide
that
question,
and
addressed
first
the
jurisdictional
question,
the
issue
here
is
fundamentally
who
has
authority
to
decide
whether
the
administrative
action
of
dropping
from
the
rolls
does
implicate
criminal
punishment.
in
our
view,
that
responsibility
falls
to
the
military
bodies
assigned
for
that
responsibility
and
to
the
federal
district
courts.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
yes,
he
is.
he
has
been,
as
a
result
of
the
order
of
the
caaf,
not
discharged
from
the
military.
and
because
his
sentence
has
expired,
he
has
returned
to
active
duty.
the
manner
in
which
the
case
came
to
the
caaf
is
significant
because
it
reveals
that
the
caaf
entertained
not
only
the
action
to
drop
major
goldsmith
from
the
rolls,
but
it
also
entertained
an
action
that
he
was
not
being
given
appropriate
medical
treatment
while
in
military
confinement.
and
the
issue
of
what
kind
of
medical
treatment
a
prisoner
is
being
given
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
findings
and
sentence
of
the
court-martial
that
confined
him
to
custody.
normally,
challenges
to
the
way
in
which
someone
is
being
held
under
a
judgment
are
brought
in
a
federal
court
or
through
administrative
procedures...
proceedings
that
are
made
available
for
that.
it
is
not
a
continuing
source
of
jurisdiction
for
the
caaf
over
all
actions
administering
sentence
simply
because
it
once
had
power,
which
in
this
case
it
never
even
exercised,
to
review
the
sentence
in
question.
and
a
further
indication
of
how
far
the
caaf
has
gone
from
reviewing
court-martial
sentences
is
that
it
issued
an
injunction
not
only
against
the
secretary
of
the
air
force
and
subordinate
officials
not
even
to
proceed
with
the
duty...
the
dropping
from
the
rolls
procedure...
its
injunction
actually
issued
to
the
president
of
the
united
states.
and
it
is
clearly
something
that
is
rather
extraordinary
to
suppose
that
an
article
i
court,
which
has
no
specific
jurisdiction
at
all
to
review
this
kind
of
personnel
action,
could
issue
an
injunction
against
the
president
that
would
prevent
him
from
removing
from
military
service
an
officer
who
has
been
convicted
of
disobeying
orders
and
committing
assaults
that
were
likely
to
re...
lead
to
grievous
or
serious
injury.
if
the
court
has
no
further
questions,
i
would
save
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
if
the
court
has
no
further
questions,
i
would
waive
rebuttal.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
justice
breyer,
the
question
of...
of
the
meaning
and
interpretation
of
all
writs
act
jurisdiction
is
not
a
question
of
expertise
in
military
law.
the
fundamental
issue
here
is,
what
does
the
all
writs
act
allow
a
sentencing
court
or,
in
this
case,
an
appellate
court
that
might
have,
but
did
not,
actually
review
an
underlying
criminal
judgment
if
somebody
else
threatens
actions
that
conceivably
would
implicate
double
jeopardy
rights.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
i
think
the
answer
comes
from
justice
stevens'
hypothetical,
which
is
that,
if
that
kind
of
unauthorized
punishment
is
being
meted
out,
whether
it
be
with
a
prior
court-martial--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--or
without
it,
your
remedy
is
federal
habeas
corpus.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
i...
i
think
i
conceded
earlier
that
if
there
were
a
formal
modification
of
the
actual
judgment
that
had
been
before
a
reviewing
court,
traditional
all
writ...
writs
act
authority
would
permit
it
to
rectify
the--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--to
correct
the
sentence,
yes,
but
not
to
adjudge
the
lawfulness
of
the
administration
of
a
sentence.
there--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--if
i
understand
your
hypothetical
correctly,
they
would
have
authority
to
say
that
you
cannot
modify
the
judgment
in
the
fashion
that
you
thought
you
had
authority
to
do.
i
don't
want
to
speak
too
broadly
on
that,
because
there
is
actually
authority
of
the
jag
to
reduce
a
sentence
even
after
it
has
been
affirmed.
and
so,
to
a
large
extent,
you
really
have
to
understand
that
the
caaf's
authority
is
limited
to
ensuring
fair
rights
under
the
ucmj
for
the
court-martial
sentences
that
are
brought
before
it
for
review.
and
thereafter,
other
bodies
in
the
military
and
other
bodies
in
the
federal
court
system
have
responsibility
for
adjudicating
the
constitutional
and
statutory
claims
that
servicemembers
might
render.
and
i
don't
think
that
that's
terribly
different
from
the
civilian
courts,
but
it
should
be
reinforced
by
an
additional
principle
here.
the
purpose
of
military
justice
is
to
reinforce
discipline
and
order
within
the
military
system.
and
there
are
a
whole
host
of
jurisdictional
and
statutory
bases
within
the
military
for
maintaining
discipline,
of
which
the
caaf
and
the
ucmj
are
just
one.
congress
divided
up
the
world
in
the
way
that
it
did
and
assigned
responsibilities
to
various
bodies
within
the
military
and
to
the
federal
courts
outside
the
military.
and
the...
the
caaf,
in
this
case,
has
not
adhered
to
the
firewalls
that
were
put
on
its
jurisdiction,
but
has
reached
out
to
review
actions
by
other
parties
under
the
military
that
are
really
to
be
reviewed
elsewhere.
thank
you.
