unknown
speaker
mr.
dreeben,
exactly
how
could
the
respondent
have
proceeded
to
raise
his
issue
of
double
jeopardy,
and...
and
before
what
agency
or
agencies?
unknown
speaker
well,
what
if,
in
the
case
of
an
ordinary
criminal
conviction
within
the
armed
services
that's
been
upheld
by
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
armed
forces,
does
a
defendant
in
a
situation
like
that
have
resort
to
federal
courts
under
habeas
corpus
or
something
else,
or
not
at
all?
unknown
speaker
mr.
dreeben,
what
about
the
argument
that
this
relief
was
necessary
to
protect
or
effectuate
the
result
of
the
court-martial,
which
was
specifically
that
he
not
be
dismissed
from
service?
that
was
an
option
that
they
had
and
that
they
didn't
impose.
so,
why
isn't
this
a
legitimate
means
of
protecting
the
judgment
that
there
be
no
dismissal?
unknown
speaker
and
you...
you
say
the
remedy
is
ask
the
secretary,
then
ask
the
board
of
corrections
of
military
records,
and--
unknown
speaker
--is
that
the
one
that's
been
spending
its
time
deciding
whether
samuel
mudd
was
properly
convicted?
unknown
speaker
in
this
case,
but...
but
not
the
samuel
mudd
case...
in
this
case,
does-the
apa
review
come
from
the
board
of
corrections?
unknown
speaker
you
indicated
in
your
answer
to
justice
o'connor
there
is
apa
review.
unknown
speaker
do
you
exhaust
your
remedies
before
the
board
of
correction
of
military
records
and
then
go
to
a
court
under
the
apa?
unknown
speaker
my
question
is,
if
you
did
that
with
the
board,
do
you
then
have
any
judicial
review
of
what
the
board
did?
unknown
speaker
under
the
apa?
unknown
speaker
and...
and
are
these
rev...
are...
are
its
actions
often
reviewed
in
the
courts?
unknown
speaker
i'm
surprised
to
hear
you
say
that...
that
in
order
to
pursue
these
judicial
remedies,
you
don't
have
to
go
before
the
board
of
corrections.
is
that...
is
that
well-established?
i
would
have
thought
that
there's
an
exhaustion
requirement.
unknown
speaker
but
that...
but
that's
not
an
apa
action;
that's
a
tucker
act
action.
unknown
speaker
you...
you
said
that
there
was
an...
an
action
under
the
administrative
procedure
act.
unknown
speaker
is...
is
it
the
case
that
the
merits
in
the
jurisdictional
question
are
tied
together?
that
is,
if
you
see
this
action
as
a
punishment,
it
would
make
sense
to
say
that
the...
the
criminal
court
has
jurisdiction,
through
the
all
writs
act,
to
stop
some
other
part
of
the
army
from...
let's
say
they
explicitly
said,
and
we're
going
to
punish
you
some
more
by
making
you
do
extra
duty,
making
you
do
this,
making
you
do
that,
dropping
you
from
the
rolls...
i
guess
they
might
have
jurisdiction
there.
but
if
you
don't
see
it
as
a
punishment,
you
rather
see
it
is
as
a
consequence
or
some
kind
of
other
general
action,
then,
of
course,
they
wouldn't
have
jurisdiction.
but,
i
mean,
looked
at
that
way,
you
have
to
decide
the
merits
in
order
to
decide
if
they
have
the
jurisdiction.
unknown
speaker
well--
unknown
speaker
--well,
even...
even
if...
even
if...
even
if
this
were
something
other
than
you're
saying
it
is,
certainly
the
way
a
double
jeopardy
is
ordinarily
administered
is
not
for
the
court
where
the
first
sentence
was
imposed
to
start
proceedings
to
enjoin
another
court.
you
raise
it
in
the
second
court,
do
you
not?
unknown
speaker
that's
true.
that's...
that's
exactly
the
question
i'm...
i'm...
i
don't
know
the
answer
to.
unknown
speaker
so,
imagine,
though,
that
the...
the...
the
different
part
of
the
army
had
said
this...
they...
they
write
out
the
following.
they
say:
we
don't
think
that
that
court-martial
board
did
enough
by
way
of
punishment.
we
want
to
punish
this
person
further.
and
so,
by
way
of
punishment,
what
we
shall
do...
and
we
promise
it's
punishment...
is
we
shall
throw
him
out
of
the
army
in
order
to
really
punish
him.
and
they
write
as
many
of
the
words
50
times.
all
right,
now
suppose
all
that
had
really
happened.
then
would
this
court
have
jurisdiction?
unknown
speaker
because?
unknown
speaker
do
you
agree
that
the...
that
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
armed
forces
is
being
impaired
when
additional
punishment
is
added?
unknown
speaker
i
see.
right.
i
assume
if
they
tried
to
impose
the
second
punishment
instead
of
the
first,
and...
and
undo
the
first,
then...
then
there
would
be
an
impairment?
unknown
speaker
mr.
dreeben,
is
there
any
practical
difference
in
these
three
ways
of
removing
an
officer?
one
is
if
the
court-martial
itself
had
imposed
discharge.
one
is
an
administrative
separation.
and
the
third
is
what
we're
dealing
with
here;
you
refer
to
it
by
three
initials.
they
all
get
the
person
out,
and
that
person
doesn't
get
any
pay
or
allowances.
is
there
any
practical
difference
among
the
three?
unknown
speaker
does
the
court
of
military...
or
does
the
military
court,
the
sentencing
court,
take
dropping
from
the
rolls
into
consideration
in
the
sentencing,
and
say,
this
is
a
serious
felony,
we
know
you're
going
to
be
dropped
from
the
rolls,
therefore
we
will
reduce
our
punishment
somewhat
to
the
following?
unknown
speaker
well...
well,
it
might
know
it
judicially.
they
say,
in
these
cases,
you're
usually
dropped
from
the
rolls,
and
we
presume
that
you
will
be,
and
therefore
we
will
tailor
our
sentence
accordingly.
unknown
speaker
mr.
dreeben,
you...
you
said,
i
think,
a
minute
ago
that
if...
if
the
executive...
if
the
military,
in
purporting
to
enforce
the
sentence,
went
beyond
its
term...
say,
there
was
to
be
loss
of
half
pay
and
the
military
said,
well,
we're
going
to...
we're
going
to
see
that
he
loses
three-quarters
pay...
that
in
those
circumstances
the
all
writs
act
could
be
used,
in
effect,
to
bring
the
matter
back
to
the
court
of
appeals,
in
effect,
for
enforcement
of
sentence;
is
that
right?
unknown
speaker
how
would...
how
would
a
claim
for...
for
a...
a
failure
to
follow
the
judgment
after
the
review
be
brought
and
enforced?
unknown
speaker
in
my
example,
he
would
bring
a
tucker
act?
unknown
speaker
mr.
dreeben,
there
was...
the
reason
given
for
going
the
caaf
route
rather
than
the
more
lengthy
military
district
court
or
claims
court
was
the
illness
of
goldsmith.
is
he
still
alive?
unknown
speaker
thank
you,
mr.
dreeben.
mr....
is
it
economidy?
unknown
speaker
say
it
again,
will
you.
unknown
speaker
economidy.
unknown
speaker
very
well,
we'll
hear
from
you.
unknown
speaker
was
it...
was
it
automatic?
i
thought
it
had
to
be...
i...
i
thought
it's
up
to
the
president.
unknown
speaker
well,
yes,
i
was
referring
to
the
dfr.
unknown
speaker
what
are
you
referring
to?
unknown
speaker
is
that
what
justice
kennedy
was
asking
about?
no,
i...
i--
unknown
speaker
--well,
does...
does
that--
--is
that
being
done
now?
--does
the
instruction
address
itself
to
being
dropped
from
the
rolls?
unknown
speaker
yes.
but
i...
i
take
it
you
could
get
relief
if
it
were
an
issue
of
confinement
by
habeas
and
if
it
were
an
issue
of
money
under
the
tucker
act.
is
that
correct?
unknown
speaker
what
court
of
appeals
are
you
talking
about?
unknown
speaker
okay.
unknown
speaker
well,
but
what...
what
about
my
question?
my
question
was,
if
there...
if
there
were
an...
an
issue
of
confinement,
he
would
have
a
habeas
remedy,
and
if
there
were
an
issue
of...
of
money,
he
would
have
a
tucker
act
remedy.
are
those
two
statements
correct?
unknown
speaker
well,
are...
are
you
saying
that
someone
imprisoned
out
of
this
country,
in
the
custody
of
an
american
custodian,
cannot
bring
habeas
corpus?
unknown
speaker
well,
are
you
saying...
or
perhaps
you're
not
expressing
any
opinion
on...
whether
someone
held
in
custody
in
the
military,
outside
of
this
country
but
by
an
american
custodian,
could...
could
sue
for
habeas
corpus
in
the...
in
a
federal
district
court?
unknown
speaker
i...
i
don't
have
the
same
recollection
you
do
of
those
cases.
unknown
speaker
well,
but
one...
your
argument,
as
i
understand
it,
for
this
being
a
court-martial-type
case,
is
that
he
can
only
get
his
remedy
in
the
court...
in
the...
in
the
court
of
appeals
because
habeas
isn't
available.
unknown
speaker
well,
but
a
specialty
court
that
is,
by
statute,
given
the
authority
to
review
sentences
that
are
brought
before
it.
this
is
something
quite
different.
unknown
speaker
there...
there
is
no
precedent
at
all
in...
in
civil
law
for
saying
that
a
court
which
imposes
the
first
sentence
that's
the
basis
of
the...
should
then
go
about
scurrying
about
and
enjoin
the
second
court.
you
raise
that
question
in
the
second
court
or
the
second
agency
and
proceed
through
review
channels
there.
you
don't
go
back
to
the
first
court
and
get
an
injunction.
i've
never
heard
of
that.
unknown
speaker
we
know...
i
know
that
they'll
take
it.
that's
why
this
case
is
here.
the
question
is--
--that's
why...
that's
why
this
case
is
here.
the
question
is
whether
they
took
it
properly.
unknown
speaker
the
sentence
hasn't
been
changed.
the
sentence
stood.
another...
another
forum
has
imposed
an
additional
sentence.
now,
do
they
have
authority
to
prevent
other
forums
from
imposing
additional
sentences?
unknown
speaker
where...
where
do
you
find
that
within
their
jurisdictional
statute?
unknown
speaker
just
give
me
the
text
of
it.
unknown
speaker
their
sentence
hasn't
been
touched.
their
sentence
stood.
if
somebody
tried
to
reduce
their
sentence,
and...
and
let
him
out
of
the
stockade,
i
suppose
they...
they...
they
would
have
jurisdiction
to
protect
their
own...
their
own
jurisdiction.
unknown
speaker
that
sentence
isn't
being
increased.
an
additional
sentence
is
being
imposed
by
another
forum.
unknown
speaker
well,
assuming
that
to
be
true,
do
you...
you
don't
dispute
that...
that
your
client
could
have...
could
have
raised
every
issue
that
he
is
now
trying
to
raise
by
going
to
that
board
for
correction
of...
whatever
it
is--
unknown
speaker
--yeah.
unknown
speaker
i'm
not
sure
that
i'm
following
your
answer.
unknown
speaker
but
i
take
it
your
bottom-line
answer
is
no,
he
could
not
have
gone
to
the
board
for
correction
in
this
case?
unknown
speaker
what,
because
of
the
constitutional
claim
that
you're
raising;
is
that
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
the...
i...
i
don't
think
we're...
we're
following
each
other.
i...
i
am
assuming
that
the
only
thing
that
your
client
would
seek
review
of
before
this
board
would
have
been
the
order
to
drop
him
from
the
rolls.
are
you
saying
that
the
board
does
not
have
jurisdiction
to
review
that
particular
action
of
the
military?
unknown
speaker
well,
let...
let
me
ask
you
this.
let's
assume
that
your
client
had
been
convicted
not
by
a
court-martial
but
by
a
civilian
criminal
court,
and
then
had
been
dropped
from
the
rolls.
would
the
board
for
correction
have
jurisdiction
to
review
a
challenge
to
the
action
of
dropping
him
under
those
circumstances?
unknown
speaker
now,
if
we
should
decide
that
in
fact
the
board
for
correction
would
have
jurisdiction
here,
would
that
be
the
end
of
your
case?
unknown
speaker
what
if
corrections
said
that
it
doesn't
have
jurisdiction
in
these
matters?
is
there
a
case
of
theirs
that
says,
"we
do
not
have
jurisdiction"?
i
mean,
you
tell
me
that
they--
unknown
speaker
--well,
you...
you
say
they
have
no
jurisdiction
to
make
these
corrections.
do
you
have
cases--
unknown
speaker
--where
someone
has
tried
to
get
a
correction,
and
they
say,
"gee,
you
know,
i'm
sorry,
we'd
like
to
give
it
to
you,
but
we
have
no
jurisdiction?
"
unknown
speaker
i'm
not
talking
about
the
federal
court.
i'm
talking
about
the
board
of
corrections.
i
mean,
you...
you're...
you're
saying
that
the
board
of
corrections
has
no
jurisdiction
over
these
matters.
unknown
speaker
well,
maybe
you
don't
think
so.
do
they
think
so?
unknown
speaker
has
the
board
ever
said
so?
has
the
board
ever
responded
to
a
request
for
review
by
saying,
"we
do
not
have
jurisdiction",
on
the
grounds
that
you
have
just
been...
been
stating
to
us?
unknown
speaker
well,
the
board
has
a
fairly--
unknown
speaker
--the
board
has
a
fairly
generous
idea
of
its
jurisdiction,
if
it
can
renew
the
court-martial
of
samuel
mudd,
which
took
place
in
1865.
unknown
speaker
what--
unknown
speaker
--is...
is
there
a
citation
you
can
give
us
for
that,
the
modification?
the...
you
say
congress--
unknown
speaker
--no,
but
i
mean
just...
just
the--
unknown
speaker
--thank
you.
is
that...
is
that
in
the
materials?
you've
been
referring
to
it
repeatedly,
and
i've
been
looking
for
it.
is
it...
is
it...
is
it
in
the
appendix
to
the
cert
petition,
or
is
it
anywhere
that
i
can
read
it?
unknown
speaker
this...
i
mean,
i
think
everyone...
or
at
least
i
would
have
the
same
question,
but
i'd
focus
this
way...
say
soldier
mudd
or
some
other
soldier
is
walking
along
the
street
one
day
and
he
gets
a
letter.
mudd
wasn't
even--
--it
says,
"dear
soldier,
you
are
dropped
from
the
rolls.
"
well,
the
soldier
says,
"this
is
certainly
an
error".
and
is
there
some
place
he
can
go?
unknown
speaker
now...
now...
now
what
soldier
mudd
says,
or
the
other
soldier--
unknown
speaker
--well...
well,
no,
he's
not.
he's...
he's
in
his
barracks
when
he
gets
the
letter.
he's
not
awol
or
anything.
he
thinks
an
error
has
been
made.
some
person
by
the
same
name
is
doing
something
bad,
but
not
him.
i
guess
there's
a
place
he
could
go,
right?
unknown
speaker
well,
here
he
is
in
his
barracks.
he's
got
the
letter.
it's
a
big
mistake.
where
does
he
go?
unknown
speaker
fine.
the
commander
says,
fine,
i'm
not
a
lawyer.
i...
i
see
this
letter;
it's
written
by
a
general.
where
do
i
go?
where
does
he
go?
unknown
speaker
fine.
all
that
fails.
now,
where
does
he
go?
unknown
speaker
fine.
now,
it
happens
that
his
claim
of
this
gross
error
is
that
it's
an
added
punishment
for
a
court-martial
i
previously
had.
can't
he
take
the
same
route?
why
not?
what's
the
legal
authority
that
says
he
can't?
unknown
speaker
what...
what's
the
name
of
that
case?
unknown
speaker
well,
you
have
the
cite
for
that?
isn't
that
inconsistent
with
southy?
i
mean,
the
argument
that
you
are
making,
that
you
made
in
your
brief,
was
that
if
the
administrator
can't
give
you
the
constitutional
judgment
that
you
want,
you
can
skip
over
it
and
go
directly
to
court.
and
this
court,
in
weinberger
against
southy,
said
no,
even
though
the
administrative
agency
doesn't
have
authority
to
hold
the
law
it
administers
unconstitutional,
still,
you
can't
skip
over
that
route.
because
there
are
other
questions
to
be
resolved,
you
have
to
go
that
route.
and
then
you
get
to
a
court
that
can
deal
with
the
constitutional
question.
so,
why
is
this
any
different?
unknown
speaker
that's
what
you
said
in
your
brief.
unknown
speaker
but
you've
been
changing
the
argument
here.
and
you're
saying
the
reason
that
you
went...
one
of
the
reasons...
was
that
the
board
of
corrections
didn't...
could
not
take
such
a
case.
in
your
brief,
you
said
you
needed
fast
relief.
unknown
speaker
all
right.
suppose
i
don't
view
it
that
way.
suppose
i
view
the
later
action
as
having
nothing
to
do
with
the
court-martial
order.
then
surely
you
could
have
gotten
it
corrected
in
the
board
of
corrections,
right?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
don't
care
about
"probably".
i
don't
want
to
know
what
they'll
do.
you
can
always
get
what
they'll
do--
unknown
speaker
--reviewed
in
a
federal
court,
which
will
tell
them
they're
wrong.
but
would
they
have
jurisdiction
to
act
upon
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
of
course,
you
can
bring
most
anything
before
any
court--
unknown
speaker
--and
they'll
throw
it
out.
but
would
this
court
have
jurisdiction
to
take
it?
unknown
speaker
the
board
of
corrections--
unknown
speaker
--assuming
it
had
nothing--
unknown
speaker
--assuming
i
do
not
agree
with
you--
unknown
speaker
--that...
that
this
is
related
to
the
court-martial
sentence.
okay.
i
mean,
that's
your
premise.
unknown
speaker
assuming
i
don't
agree
with
that
premise,
would
the
board
of
corrections
have
had
jurisdiction
over
the
administrative
action,
severing
your
client
from
the
military?
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
they
would.
okay.
may
i
ask
you
a
question
running
through
my
mind?
supposing
a
serviceman
gets
convicted
of
an
offense
and
he
gets
sentenced
to
6
months
in
the
brig.
he
serves
his
6
months
and
he...
he
gets
out.
and
he
goes
back
on
active
duty.
he
goes
on
a
ship,
say.
and
his
commanding
officer
says,
"i
know
what
you
did;
6
months
wasn't
a
fair
punishment
for
that.
"
"i
think
you
should
have
had
9
months.
"
"i'm
going
to
lock
you
up
in
the
brig
for
90
days
more.
"
what
is
his
remedy?
can
he
get
an
all
writs
act
proceeding
before
the
caaf?
unknown
speaker
well,
just
in
my
hypothetical,
you
say
that...
that
the
all
writs
act
would
cover
that
case,
as
well
as
yours?
unknown
speaker
well,
his
sentence
has
already
been
served.
the
other
judgment
is
final.
and
no
tampering
with
that
judgment.
but
the
new
commanding
officer
just
thinks
the
punishment
was
insufficient
and
he's
decided
to
give
him
an
extra
90
days.
he
could
go
directly
to
the
caaf,
in
your
view?
unknown
speaker
well,
how
does
he...
does
he
satisfy
the
statutory
jurisdiction
requirement
on
my
facts?
that's
what
i'm
asking.
unknown
speaker
but
why
couldn't
he...
why
couldn't
he
go
there
on
the
same
theory
that
you
advocate
here?
that's
what
i'm
not...
i'm
a
little
puzzled
by.
unknown
speaker
well,
i'm
assuming
that
in
my
case
the
original
sentence
might
have
been
9
months
instead
of
6.
unknown
speaker
well,
make
it
a
year
and
18
months,
then,
because
i
don't
want
to
get--
unknown
speaker
--well,
can...
can...
do
they
still
have
company
punishment,
or
captain's
mast,
where...
can...
can
you
get
a
review
of...
of
those
kind
of
courts'
decisions
in...
in
the
court
of
appeals,
armed
forces?
unknown
speaker
yeah.
unknown
speaker
well...
well,
what
if,
under
justice
stevens'
hypothesis,
the...
the
commander
just
says,
you're
going
to
be...
i
don't...
i
don't
think
you
got
a
tough
enough
sentence
in
your
court-martial,
so
i'm
going
to
restrict
you...
i'm
going
to
restrict
you
to
the
ship
for
3
months
or
i'm
going
to
restrict
you
to
base
3
months,
and
i
intend
this
as
further
punishment?
now,
can
the
caaf
step
in,
in
that
case,
and
say,
look,
it's
double
jeopardy?
unknown
speaker
that...
that's
the
question
exactly.
what
gives
them
the
authority
to
do
that?
is
it
effect...
there
is
no
judgment
that
they're
effectuating.
what...
what...
how...
what
is
the
authority
that
the...
in
that
case,
that
the
caaf
can
step
in?
unknown
speaker
not
the
court
of
criminal
appeals,
it's
the
caaf,
right?
right.
yeah.
unknown
speaker
well,
it
isn't
their
sentence,
it's
the
sentence
of
the
court-martial.
unknown
speaker
but
their
only
jurisdiction
is
to
review
the
court-martial
judgment.
they
have
done
that.
the
further
imposition
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
court-martial.
so,
i
don't
see
how
they
would
have
jurisdiction
to
review
anything,
and
i
don't
see
how
they
would
have
jurisdiction
under
the
all
writs
act
in
aid
of...
of...
of
their...
of
some
independent
jurisdiction.
unknown
speaker
i'm...
i'm
just
missing
the
connection.
unknown
speaker
well,
you're...
you're
setting
up
a
parade
of
horribles,
but
you're
not
responding
to...
to
my
attempt
to
analyze
the
terms
in
the
all
writs
act
in
relation
to
the
jurisdictional
statute
here.
and...
and
i...
i
still
am
having
trouble
making
the
leap
that
you
want
me
to...
to
make.
unknown
speaker
yeah,
but
we're
playing
with
words.
in
the
hypothetical--
unknown
speaker
--no
one
is
changing
the
judgment.
the...
the
officer
is
saying:
you
didn't
get
enough
and
i'm
going
to...
i'm
going
to
engage
in
a
little
justice
of
my
own
here.
he's
not
changing
anything.
he's
saying,
i'm
going
to
do
this.
unknown
speaker
my
impression
is
justice
souter's
point
is
there
is
no...
if
the...
if
there
is
a
judgment
somewhere,
it's
not
in
the
caaf.
the
judgment
is
in
either
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
or
back
in
the
original
court-martial.
so,
if
you
have
some
right
to
protect
something
called
a
judgment,
it
isn't
the
caaf
you'd
go
to,
it
would
be
to
the
court
that
has
it.
unknown
speaker
well,
then...
then
what
about
the
court
of
criminal
appeals?
unknown
speaker
what
would
be
the
theory
of
going
to
a
court
that
doesn't
have
a
judgment,
that
has
no
appeal?
in
other
words,
what's
the
theory
of
going
to
the
caaf,
as
opposed
to,
let's
say,
going
to
the
court
of
claims
or
going
to
the
ninth
circuit,
or
any
other
place?
unknown
speaker
may
i
change
my
hypothetical
just
a
little.
supposing
you've
got
a
captain
queeg
here.
and
he's
got
two
servicemen
he
wants
to
discipline.
and
one
of
them
has
served
a
year's
sentence
for
something
or
other
and
it's
over.
as
to
him,
he
says,
i'm
going
to
give
you
another
90
days
because
you
didn't
get
enough
punishment.
the
second
person
has
never
been
disciplined
for
anything,
but
he
just
doesn't
like
him.
and
he
puts
him
in
the
brig
for
90
days
because
he
didn't
salute,
or
something
like
that.
and
both
of
them
are
in
the
brig
for
90
days.
one
of
the
could
go
to
the
court
of
the
armed
forces,
the
other
could
not?
unknown
speaker
yeah.
is
there
any
other
situation
where
a
court
of
ultimate
review
in
the
hierarchy
can
act
as
the
court
of
first
view?
that's
what
makes
this
picture
really
anomalous,
because
the
caaf
is
stepping
in
to
correct
whatever
it
perceives
as
an
error.
but
it's
taking
a
first
view,
when
it's
set
up
by
the
statute
to
be
a
court
of
review.
and
it's
not
reviewing
anything
that
has
been
said
lower
down
in
the
hierarchy.
is
there
any
counterpart
to
that
notion
that--
unknown
speaker
--and
you
say
that
congress
set
up
this
hierarchy,
distinct
from
all
others,
so
that
the
court
of
last
resort
in
that
hierarchy
can
also
take
a
first
view.
is
there
anything
that
suggests
that
congress
had
that
in
mind?
unknown
speaker
but
the
d...
the
dfr
is
not
a
court-martial
proceeding,
is
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
then,
you're
really
saying
that
the
caaf
has
rather
broad
authority
just
to
see
to
it
that
the
army
doesn't
get
out
of
line
when
it's
treating
individuals,
or
the
navy--
unknown
speaker
--well,
but
that
doesn't
make
it
so,
as
anyone
who's
written
an
opinion
before
knows.
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
thank
you,
mr.
economidy.
mr.
dreeben,
you
have
5
minutes
remaining.
unknown
speaker
well,
actually,
i
do.
i
mean,
what...
what
do
you
say
to
his
point,
that...
as
i
take
it,
he
says
that
the...
that
the
caaf
has
very
broad
jurisdiction,
that...
that
if
a
commander
decides
to
put
somebody
in
prison
for
3
extra
months
or
extra
duty
or
any
of
these
things
intended
as
a
punishment,
yes,
you
can
go
to
the
caaf,
because
that's
the
most
practical
route,
it's
somehow
related
to
the
basic
sentence,
and
that's
all
you
need?
so...
so,
if
you
were
to
say
there's
authority
here
that
says
to
the
contrary...
and
this
is
all
military
law,
i...
i
don't
know
what
the
military...
we
have
an
expert
military
court
saying
he's
right.
so...
so,
what
authority
do
you
have
to
say
he's
not
right?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
suppose
he'd
say
that
the...
in
the
military,
perhaps
though
not
in
the
civil
system,
what...
there...
there
is
some
kind
of
a
remedy,
where
a
commander
takes
a
person
and
subjects
him
to
punishment
growing
out
of
a
conviction,
and
that
conviction
specified
you
shouldn't
have
that
punishment.
and
maybe
you
have
to
go
back
to
the
original
court-martial
and
attack
it
first.
but
if
you
do
do
that,
there
might
be
an
appeal,
so
they're
preserving
their
appellate
jurisdiction.
unknown
speaker
meted
out.
unknown
speaker
let
me
change
the
hypothetical
to
say
that,
in
doing
this
the
extra
90
days,
the...
the
body
that
does
this
says,
to
the
extent
necessary,
this
shall
constitute
a
modification
of
the
criminal
judgment
entered
on
such
and
such
a
date.
unknown
speaker
what
if
it
purported
to
be
a
modification
but
there
was
no
actual
power
to
modify;
the
wrong
tribunal
did
it,
but
they
thought
they
had
the
power
to
modify
the
earlier
judgment,
but
they
didn't?
they
said,
instead
of...
we're
going
to
modify
the
judgment
by
changing
it
in
this
respect.
then
would
they
have
jurisdiction?
unknown
speaker
would
they
have
jurisdiction
to
correct
the
attempted
modification
of
the
judgment?
unknown
speaker
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
98-347,
clinton
versus
goldsmith
will
be
announced
by
justice
souter.
this
case
comes
to
us
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
armed
forces.
respondent
goldsmith
is
a
major
in
the
united
states
air
force
who
disobeyed
an
order
to
tell
his
sex
partners
that
he
was
infected
with
hiv
and
to
take
precautions
in
having
sexual
relations.
he
was
convicted
by
general
court-martial
of
lawful
disobedience
and
sentenced
to
six
years
confinement
and
partial
forfeiture
of
his
salary.
the
air
force
court
of
criminal
appeals
affirmed
and
when
goldsmith
did
not
seek
review
of
that
decision
his
conviction
became
final.
subsequently,
the
air
force
invoked
a
newly
enacted
statute
authorizing
the
president
to
drop
from
the
rolls
of
the
armed
forces.
any
officer
who
had
both
been
sentenced
by
court-martial
more
than
six
months
confinement
and
had
served
at
least
six
months
time
and
the
air
force
notified
goldsmith
that
it
was
taking
action
to
drop
him
from
the
rolls.
goldsmith
did
not
contest
the
air
forces'
plan
immediately,
but
instead
petitioned
to
court
of
criminal
appeals
for
extraordinary
release
to
redress
the
unrelated
alleged
interruption
of
his
hiv
medication
while
in
confinement.
the
court
ruled
that
it
lacked
jurisdiction
to
act
and
it
was
in
goldsmith's
appeal
from
that
decision
that
he
first
asserted
a
claim
that
the
air
forces'
decision
to
drop
him
violated
the
ex
post
facto
and
double
jeopardy
clauses
of
the
constitution.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
armed
forces
responded
favorably
to
these
claims
and
relied
on
the
all
writs
act
to
enjoin
the
president
and
other
officials
from
dropping
goldsmiths
from
air
force
rolls.
we
granted
certiorari
and
now
reverse.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
armed
forces
is
an
article
i
court
with
strictly
circumscribes
statutory
authority
to
review
findings
and
sentences
imposed
by
courts-martial.
the
all
writs
act
authorizes
the
court
only
to
issue
all
writs
necessary
or
appropriate
in
aid
of
its
jurisdiction.
since
the
air
force's
action
to
drop
goldsmiths
in
the
rolls
was
not
a
finding
or
a
sentence
that
was
or
could
have
been
imposed
in
a
court-marshal
proceeding.
it
was
beyond
the
court's
jurisdiction
to
review
and
hence
beyond
the
aid
of
the
all
writs
act
in
reviewing
it.
even
if
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
armed
forces
had
some
arguable
bases
for
jurisdiction,
resort
to
the
all
writs
act
would
still
be
out
of
bounds,
it
is
not
a
necessary
or
appropriate
in
light
of
the
alternative
remedies
available
to
a
service
member
demanding
to
be
kept
on
the
rolls.
in
this
case
goldsmith
could
present
his
claim
to
the
air
force
board
of
correction
for
military
records.
a
civilian
body
with
broad
ranging
authority
to
consider
service
members
claims.
he
may
also
have
recourse
to
the
federal
trial
courts
by
bringing
either
a
challenge
under
the
administrative
procedure
act
or
else
a
claim
for
monetary
relief
under
the
tucker
act.
the
opinion
of
the
court
is
unanimous.
