mr.
john
m.
economidy
economidy,
just
like
america's
economy,
except
it's
"omidy".
mr.
john
m.
economidy
economidy.
mr.
john
m.
economidy
i'm
used
to
"ec",
though,
however.
mr.
john
m.
economidy
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i'd
like
to
correct
two
incorrect
responses,
first,
to
justice
kennedy
and
then
to
justice
souter.
you
had
asked
about
an
instruction
in
this
particular
case,
if
this
statute
on
dropped
from
the
rolls
had
existed
at
the
time
respondent,
major
goldsmith,
would
have
been
entitled
to
an
instruction.
the
case
is
united
states
v.
powell,
30
c.m.r.--
we
have
a
provision
in
the
uniform
code
of
military
justice,
which
you
may
opt
out
by
regulation.
the
air
force
has.
and
it's
an
automatic
reduction
in
grade
if
you
get
confinement.
in
that
particular
case,
congress
had
passed
the
law,
but
the
individual
did
not
receive
an
instruction
on
the
automatic
effect
of
this
reduction
in
rank,
which
is
sort
of
what
the
dfr
is.
within
the
military
judges
bench
book,
their
book...
book
of
instructions,
you
have
in
there
an
instruction
that
if
you
give
a
particular
sentence,
then
you're
going
to
have
an
automatic
reduction.
so,
if
you
asked,
justice
kennedy,
would
he
be
entitled
to
an
instruction,
the
answer
would
be
yes,
i--
mr.
john
m.
economidy
--you
have
to
meet
certain
criteria,
justice
scalia,
to
have
that
automatic
reduction
in
rank,
unless
you're
referring
to
the
dfr.
mr.
john
m.
economidy
okay.
mr.
john
m.
economidy
i
was
referring
to
article
58(a).
article
58(a)
has
an
automatic
reduction
in
rank,
down
to
e-1.
mr.
john
m.
economidy
he
had
asked
about
instructions.
and
i
am
taking
this
by
an
analogy,
that
if
you
have
a
certain
result
in
a
court,
could
they
be
entitled
to
an
instruction
that
would
educate
the
members
of
the
court-martial?
and
the
answer
is
yes.
and
the
powell
case
would
do
that.
mr.
john
m.
economidy
it
hasn't
yet,
because
the
statute
occurred.
there
has
not
been
a
dfr
in
the
air
force
involving
this
statute,
to
my
knowledge,
except
for
major
goldsmith's
case,
because
we
have
a
state
proceeding.
justice
souter,
you
had
asked,
and
the
response
was,
well,
he
could
bring
a
bivens
action.
that
is
incorrect.
we
have
the
ferius
defense
that
an
active
duty
member
cannot
sue
incident
to
military
service.
and
that
has
been
extended
over
to
civil
rights.
the
case
is
chappell
v.
wallace.
mr.
john
m.
economidy
the
place
to
go
in
this
particular
case
would
be
the
court
of
appeals.
because
the
court
of
appeals,
by
their
statute,
article
67,
can
act
on
findings
and
on
sentence.
and
when
you
look
at
the
court
of
appeals
opinion
in
goldsmith,
particularly
paragraph
1,
page--
mr.
john
m.
economidy
--the
court
of
appeals
for
the
armed
forces.
mr.
john
m.
economidy
caaf.
mr.
john
m.
economidy
those
statements
are
correct.
but
if
you're
in
the
military
and
you're
imprisoned
in
turkey,
or
you're
imprisoned
in
japan,
or
germany,
you've
got
one
place
to
go,
and
that
is
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
armed
forces,
because
the
code
applies
worldwide,
under
article
v.
in
this
particular
case--
mr.
john
m.
economidy
--i
would
have
habeas
corpus
in
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
armed
forces.
mr.
john
m.
economidy
i
think
this
court
has
given
opinions
like
the
gusic
case
versus
shoder,
schlesinger
v.
councilman,
that
says
if
you
go
into
federal
courts,
you
should
have
comity,
and
they
should
go
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
armed
forces
or
to
the
other
military
appellate
courts.
that's
why
we
went
to
the
military
courts
in
this
case.
i--
mr.
john
m.
economidy
--what
they're
saying
there
is
that
if
you
have
a
court-martial-type
case,
you
should
go
to
the
military
court,
is
how
i
read
the
cases.
mr.
john
m.
economidy
i'm
not
saying
habeas
is
not
available
in
the
federal
courts.
i'm
saying
we
have
a
specialty
court,
and
that's
where
we
should
go
first.
mr.
john
m.
economidy
i
would
suggest
to
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
that
what
we
have
here
is
an
increased
sentence;
and
therefore,
under
article
67,
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
armed
forces
can
act
to
protect
and
effectuate
that
sentence.
mr.
john
m.
economidy
mr.
chief
justice,
if
we
had
the
situation
where
the
individual
was
kept
in
confinement
past
his
confinement
date,
we
can
still
go
into
the
military
appellate
courts.
we
have
done
that
in
the
mccray
case.
we
had
a
very
similar
factual
situation
in
the
u.s.
v.
mahoney,
in--
mr.
john
m.
economidy
--i
think
that
they
did,
justice
scalia,
because
they
can
act
on
the
sentence,
under
article
67.
and
if
they
want
to
protect--
mr.
john
m.
economidy
--i
believe--
mr.
john
m.
economidy
--i
find
it--
mr.
john
m.
economidy
--and
the
text
of
it
is
where
they
can
act
upon
the
sentence.
if
the
sentence
is
increased,
they
have
a--
mr.
john
m.
economidy
--i
believe
they
have
the
right
to
protect
the
sentence
from
being
increased
by
an
unconstitutional
act--
mr.
john
m.
economidy
--the
forum
here
was
a
dropped
from
the
roll
action.
a
dropped
from
the
roll
action,
if
you
go
to
winthrop's
treatise...
and
he
cites
the
army
regulation
of
1890:
when
a
person
who
is
dropped
from
the
rolls
leaves
in
a
dishonorable
status.
you
also
had
that
same
situation,
in
the
statutory
definition
today,
of
a
veteran,
under
title
38,
u.s.
code,
section
101(2).
mr.
john
m.
economidy
the
board
for
correction
of
military
records--
mr.
john
m.
economidy
--would
not
help
my
client
in
this
particular
case
for
the
following
two
reasons.
first,
the
stat...
statute,
which
is
10
u.s.c.,
1522,
says
you
can
only
go
in
on
military
justice
matters
in
two
cases:
number
one,
a
correction
of
the
court-martial
order;
or,
number
two,
the
situation
where
there
was
insufficient
clemency
granted
by
the
convening
authority
in
the
first
place.
in
this
particular--
mr.
john
m.
economidy
--all
right.
mr.
john
m.
economidy
you
can
always
go,
but
he
would
not
be
able
to
get
relief.
they
would
find
the
matter
non-cognizable.
mr.
john
m.
economidy
no.
because
it
involves
a
military
court-martial
sentence.
mr.
john
m.
economidy
i
don't
believe
it
is,
because
they
would
view
it
as
a
military
justice
matter.
and
this
particular
authorization
act,
104-106,
there
was
a
section,
551,
which
required
the
section
551
study.
and
one
of
the
findings
in
that
particular
thing
was
that
37
percent
of
all
air
force
cases
that
have
been
in
litigation
in
the
past
year
could
not
receive
relief
in
the
board
of
corrections
for
military
records.
the
facts
on
the
army
was
one-third
of
the
cases
that
they
could
not--
mr.
john
m.
economidy
--they
could
hear
the
case
then
because
it
would
not
involve
the
statutory
restrictions
in
section
1522.
mr.
john
m.
economidy
it
means
we
would
take
an
alternative
course
of
action.
we
may
be
going
back
in
to
the
board
of
corrections.
he
is
due
to
retire
on
the
1st
of
july,
which
would
be
my
first
concern.
mr.
john
m.
economidy
we
really
don't
have
cases
in
the
board
of
corrections,
sir.
if
you're
talking
about
like
a
federal
appeals
decision
or
something.
mr.
john
m.
economidy
no,
sir.
mr.
john
m.
economidy
i
have
been
in
cases,
particularly
woodrick
v.
divich,
which
is
somewhat
like
this.
it
was
an
all
writs
case.
we
went
into
federal
court.
the
government
argued,
"no,
you
have
to
go
into
the
court
of
appeals.
"
we
get
into
the
court
of
appeals,
we
get
the
argument,
"no,
you
have
to
go
into
federal
court.
"
it's
sort
of
a
catch--
mr.
john
m.
economidy
--i
do
not
think
that
they
do.
it
involves
the
sentence--
mr.
john
m.
economidy
--i
think
their
statutory
charter
would
preclude
it,
because--
mr.
john
m.
economidy
--i
have
had
cases
before
the
board
of
corrections
where
they
have
stated
that,
yes,
sir.
mr.
john
m.
economidy
but
not
in
this
case.
mr.
john
m.
economidy
i
would
suggest
to
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
what
they're
doing
is
going
on
the
old
board
of
corrections
statute.
mr.
john
m.
economidy
the
statute
was
modified
in
recent
years
to
preclude
that.
because
they
used
to
review
court-martial
proceeding
altogether.
and
then
congress
came
in
and
modified
the
statute.
mr.
john
m.
economidy
the...
i
can't
give
you
the
year;
it
would
be
section--
mr.
john
m.
economidy
--10
u.s.c.,
1522
is
the
statute.
mr.
john
m.
economidy
no,
it
is
not
in
the
cert
petition
or
the
appendix,
no,
sir.
mr.
john
m.
economidy
he
could
probably
go
to
the
board
of
corrections
for
a
drop
from
the
roll
action--
mr.
john
m.
economidy
--but
he's
awol
at
that
point.
mr.
john
m.
economidy
there's
a
place
he
could
go.
it
would
not
be
a
good
place
to
start.
mr.
john
m.
economidy
i'd
go
to
my
commander
first
or
to
whoever
the
source
is.
mr.
john
m.
economidy
i'd
go
to
personnel,
try
to
work
it
through
the
personnel
channels
after
that.
mr.
john
m.
economidy
you
can
say
ultimately
he
could
possibly
go
to
the
board
for
corrections
of
military
records.
mr.
john
m.
economidy
the
board
of
corrections
does
not
have
the
power
to
find
these
statutes
unconstitutional.
your
case
of
mccarthy
v.
madigan
says
you
do
not
have
to
go
through
the
administrative
route
to
exhaust
your
administrative
remedies
if
they
cannot
provide
that
particular
remedy.
mr.
john
m.
economidy
mccarthy
v.
madigan.
mr.
john
m.
economidy
my
client
at
the
time
was
dying.
i
had
to
go
somewhere
pretty
fast.
and
that
was
the
motivating
factor.
your
average
trips
to
the
board
of
corrections
run--
mr.
john
m.
economidy
--yes.
mr.
john
m.
economidy
i
don't
think
that
they
can
provide
the
remedy
under
the
two
statutory
exceptions
for
military
justice
matters
that
exist,
which
is
they
can
only
act
with
regard
to
clemency
or
technical
errors
in
the
court-martial
order,
like
they
misspell
a
name
or
they
misstate
the
sentence.
i
do
not
think
that
they
can
go
into
this
particular
case.
because,
as
we
have
viewed
this
case,
it
has
always
involved
the
sentence,
which
is
how
the
court
of
appeals
acted
under
article
67.
and--
mr.
john
m.
economidy
--the
board
of
corrections
probably
would
not
correct
this,
because
they
will
say
this
is
a
commander's
matter--
mr.
john
m.
economidy
--i
misunderstood.
mr.
john
m.
economidy
you
can
bring
most
anything
before
the
court.
they
might--
mr.
john
m.
economidy
--yes.
mr.
john
m.
economidy
the
board
of
corrections?
mr.
john
m.
economidy
it...
it--
mr.
john
m.
economidy
--it's
not
a
court.
mr.
john
m.
economidy
yes,
sir.
mr.
john
m.
economidy
mmm-hmm.
yes.
mr.
john
m.
economidy
if
they
agree
with
your
position
that
they...
that
it
is
not
a
military
justice
action--
mr.
john
m.
economidy
--then
they
probably
could,
yes,
sir.
mr.
john
m.
economidy
i
think
that
he
can,
because
it
is
an
increase
in
the
sentence
that
was
judged.
you
basically
have
the
situation
here,
because
the
convening
authority
in
goldsmith,
general
griffith,
is
the
same
person
who
brought
the
dfr
action,
after
he'd
been
promoted
and
moved
to
a
different
office.
mr.
john
m.
economidy
if
he
meets
the
statutory
criteria
for
review--
mr.
john
m.
economidy
--if
he
satisfies
the
statutory
jurisdiction,
the
answer
would
be
yes.
mr.
john
m.
economidy
on
your
facts
of
just
6
months,
no
punitive
discharge,
he
would
not
be
able
to
go
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
armed
forces.
he
could
only
go
to
the
judge
advocate
general,
perhaps,
or
through
an
article
138.
mr.
john
m.
economidy
major
goldsmith
was
sentenced
to
1
year
of
confinement.
therefore,
there
was
direct
jurisdiction
for
the
service
court,
under
article
66,
potential
jurisdiction
under
article
66.
mr.
john
m.
economidy
it
would...
it
would
have
to
be
at
least
1
year
to
get
service
court
review.
mr.
john
m.
economidy
all
right.
if
it's
a
year,
then
he
would
be
able
to
go
in...
either
to
the
service
court
or
to
caaf,
to
seek
habeas
corpus.
mr.
john
m.
economidy
the...
your
question
was
twofold.
mr.
john
m.
economidy
do
they
still
have
captain's
mast?
yes,
that's
nonjudicial
punishment
under
article
xv,
only
in
the
navy.
the
answer
is
caaf
does
not
have
jurisdiction.
the
service
courts
do
not
have
jurisdiction
for
review
of
article
xvs.
mr.
john
m.
economidy
i
think
they
can
act
on
their
sentence
under
article
67.
i
think
it
would
be
double
jeopardy
in
the
sense
of
an
increased
or
multiple
punishment,
and
that
they
could
step
in,
in
that
hypothetical.
mr.
john
m.
economidy
i
would
suggest
to
you--
mr.
john
m.
economidy
--the
caaf
would
have
to
satisfy
article
67,
to
protect
and
effectuate
the
sentence.
when
the
sentence
is
increased,
i
feel
that
they
have
a
right
to
protect
the
original
sentence
from
being
increased.
mr.
john
m.
economidy
it's
the
sentence
of
the
court-martial.
it
is
the
adjudged
and
the
affirmed
sentence.
mr.
john
m.
economidy
if
that
is--
mr.
john
m.
economidy
--well,
justice
souter,
if
that
is
the
case,
then
a
commander
can
go
out
and
increase
punishment
substantially.
you
had
that
in
the
case
that
we
cited,
u.s.
v.
maroney,
which
is
exactly
what
happened.
it
also
happened
the
same
way
in
united
states/mc...
mccray.
mr.
john
m.
economidy
i
believe
that
if
the
judgment
is
changed,
the
adjudged
and
approved
sentence,
or
the
above
adjudged
and
affirmed
judgments
in
a
civil
case--
mr.
john
m.
economidy
--well,
if
they...
if
they
change--
mr.
john
m.
economidy
--i
think
that
when
you
change
the
court
orders,
then
you
have
a
right
to
protect
it.
this
court
did
that
in
will
v.
calvert
insurance
company...
calvert
fire
insurance.
mr.
john
m.
economidy
the
court-martial
loses
judgment
as
soon
as
the
action
is
taken.
it
lose...
it
loses
jurisdiction
at
that
particular
point
in--
mr.
john
m.
economidy
--you
could
go
there
as
a
first
step,
if
you
satisfy
their
statutory
criteria.
mr.
john
m.
economidy
we
have
viewed
all
along
that
the
dfr
action
equates
to
a
dishonorable
discharge,
which
is
the
same
as
a
dismissal.
that
is
the
same
punishment
which
he
avoided
in
his
court-martial
and
in...
in
his
case.
it
also
increased
his...
his
forfeitures.
he
had
partial
forfeitures.
the
dfr
action
now
takes
it
from
partial
forfeitures
to
total
forfeitures,
not
only
of
pay,
but
also
of
allowances.
that
increases
the
sentence.
we
believe
that
the
caaf
has
the
right
to
protect
the
original
sentence.
mr.
john
m.
economidy
that's
correct,
under
your
hypothetical.
mr.
john
m.
economidy
not
that
i
know
of,
justice
ginsburg.
mr.
john
m.
economidy
i
think
the...
you
know,
as
we
have
viewed
this
all
along,
they
have
a
right
to
protect
the
serviceman
for
unconstitutional
acts
within
the
court-martial
systems.
they
did
that
in
goldsmith,
where
they
saw
the
increase
of
sentence.
they
also
did
that
in
woodrick
v.
divich,
where
they
basically
stopped
the
court-martial.
mr.
john
m.
economidy
it
is
not
a
court-martial
proceeding
as
such,
but
it's
not
necessarily
a
personnel
action.
i
would
call
it
a
military
justice
action.
mr.
john
m.
economidy
i
think
it
can
only
act
under
article
67
with
regard
to
findings
and
sentence
of
a
specific
court-martial
within
its
jurisdiction,
which
is
what
they
did
in
this
particular
case.
they
specifically
talked
in
their
opinion,
in
goldsmith,
particularly
paragraph
1(b),
about
the
sentence.
they
talk
about
acting
on
the
sentence
four
times
in
the
opinion.
mr.
john
m.
economidy
i
guess
not,
sir.
we
have
believed
all
along
that
the
drop
from
the
rolls
action
basically
equates
to
a
dishonorable
discharge
under
38
u.s.c.,
101(2),
the
definition
of
a
veteran.
also,
the
old
1891
reg
that
says
a
person
who
has
a
dfr
leaves
in
a
dishonorable
status.
that's
the
very
sentence
which
we
avoided
in
the
court-martial,
was
the
dismissal,
which
is
basically
a
dishonorable
discharge.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
