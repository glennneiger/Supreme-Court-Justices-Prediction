mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
for
well
over
a
century,
it
has
been
settled
law
that
no
plaintiff
may
obtain
money
from
the
united
states
treasury
absent
an
act
of
congress
entitling
the
plaintiff
to
the
money
or
creating
the...
or
authorizing
the
creation
of
a
right
to
that
money.
that
rule
has
been
repeatedly
recognized
in
this
court's
cases,
including
buchanan
v.
alexander,
united
states
v.
nordic
village,
united
states
v.
testan,
opm
v.
richmond,
and
republic
national
bank.
probably
nowhere
has
that
rule
been
more
often
repeated
than
in
the
context
of
subcontractor
efforts
to
obtain
payment
from
the
united
states
under
an
equitable
lien
theory
when
the
prime
contractor
that
should
have
paid
this
prime
contract...
the
subcontractor
does
not.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
well,
your
honor,
i
would
say
that
in
that
case
the
court
was
construing
the
statute
in
a
manner
to
save
its
constitutionality
consistent
with
congress'
purpose.
if
congress'
express
purpose
was
to
exclude
somebody
that
the
court
thought
was
constitutionally
included...
constitutionally
had
to
be
included
in
the
category,
then
the
answer
would
be
that
the
statute
could
not
be
enforced
at
all.
the
court
could
not
blue
pencil
in
against
congress'
intent
a
category
of
people
or
an
entitlement
to
money
that
congress
did
not
want
to
be
entitled.
so,
that
would
have
to
be
categorized
as
a
case
where
the
court
construed
the
statute
in
order
to
make
it
constitutional
and
therefore
it
read
the
statute
as
providing
for
a
payment
to
those
individuals.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
yes.
it's
possible,
your
honor,
that
the
court
stretched
quite
a
bit
to
save
the
constitutionality
of
that
statute.
but
that
does
not
change
the
underlying
principle
that
absent
a
statute,
nobody
may
obtain
money
from
the...
from
the
public
treasury,
and
the
courts
are
not
entitled
under
principles
of
common
law
or
equity
to
create
entitlements.
the
other
difference--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--i'm
sorry.
could
you
repeat
the
question?
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
i
think
it
would,
but
there's
another
point
to
it,
which
is
when
we
say
that
absent
a
statute,
we
include
in
statutes
all
positive
sources
of
law
that
are
above
common
law
and
court-made
law
and
we
would
include
the
constitution.
so,
if
the
constitution
required
a
payment
from
the
united
states
treasury...
and
i
think
it
would
be
rare
that
it
would.
if
the
constitution
required
a
payment
from
the
united
states
treasury,
then
the
court
might
have
it
within
its
power
to
order
that
payment
be
made.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
no,
i
don't
believe
that
there
is
any
constitutional
question
in
this
case.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
the...
the
army
could
not
have
done
that
without
declaring
the
prime
contractor
in
default.
so
long
as
the
contract
was
in
force,
it
was
contractually
obligated
to
pay
the
prime
contractor.
if
it
had
decided
that
the
prime
contractor
was
in
default
because
it
had
failed
to
pay
blue
fox,
then
it
could
proceed
with
the
contract.
it
would
hire
a
replacement
prime
contractor,
and
if
at
the
end
of
the
day
there
was
money
left
over
on
the
contract
that
was
owed
to
the
prime
contractor,
it
could
satisfy
the
contractual
obligation
to
pay
the
original
prime
contractor
for
the
work
it
did
by
filing
interpleader.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
pardon?
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
that's
an
interesting
theory.
because
the
contract
itself
did
not
require
a
miller
act
bond...
in
fact,
the
requirement
of
a
bond
had
been
deleted...
it
would
have
been
i
think
another
stretch
to
suggest
that
the
contractor
had
breached
a
condition
of
the
contract--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--i...
i
think--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--the
district
court
specifically
found
that
there
was
no
bond
required.
however,
in
the
ninth
circuit,
and
i
think
for
purposes
of
this
court
decision,
it's
fair
to
assume
that
there
was
a
bond
requirement
and
that
it
was
improper
to
have
deleted
it.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
that
is
a
possibility
that
verdan
was
in
default
for
the...
of
the
contract
conditions
by
not
paying
by...
blue
fox
in
a
timely
fashion.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
that's
correct.
the
contract...
the
government
has
the...
the
ability
and
oftentimes
the
duty
to
overlook
minor
defaults
in
the
contract
to
make
sure
that
the
contract
is
completed
in
a
timely
fashion.
so,
it
has
the
option
sometimes
of
declaring
a
default,
replacing
the
prime
contractor,
oftentimes
at
greater
expense,
or
it
may
overlook
minor
defaults,
complete
the
contract
to
the
best
of
its
ability.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
no,
i
don't
believe
that
the
united
states
has
discretion.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
no.
the
united
states
could
not
have
paid
blue
fox.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
no.
the
difference
is
that
the
only
way
the
united
states
could
pay
out
money
would
be
if
it
were
contractually
obligated
to
do
so.
so
long
as
it's
contractually
obligated
to
pay
the
prime
contractor--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--under
one
condition
and
that
condition
is
that
the
money
is
actually
still
owed
to
the
prime
contractor.
if
it's
owed
to
the
prime
contractor--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
+,86,000
dollars
in
total
in
two
payments,
and
i
think
there's
another
one
for
1,000
dollars--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--but
the...
the
contract
had
not
yet
been
completed.
at
that
point
in
time,
at
the
time
verdan
potentially
defaulted
by
failing
to
pay
blue
fox
on
time,
the
contract
had
not
been
completed.
so,
the
united
states
was
under
an
obligation
to
use
that
money
to
complete
the
contract,
to
hire
a
replacement
contractor
and
to
complete
it,
which
is
what
it
did.
at
the
end
of
the
day,
there
was
no
money
left
over.
so,
there
was
no
money
owed
to
the
prime
contractor
verdan.
accordingly,
it
couldn't
pay
that
money
out.
it
wasn't
owed
under
contract.
i
think
even
under
equitable
lien
principles,
the
requirement
is
that
before
a
subcontractor
can
claim
money,
that
money
has
to
be
owed
to
the
prime
contractor
for
which
it
worked.
and
even
the
gao
would
not
allow
the
army
to
pay
out
money
to
a
subcontractor
unless
that
money
was
actually
earned
and
owed
to
the
prime
contractor
for
which
it
worked.
i
should
also
point
out
that
in...
we...
in
our
view
the
position
of
the
gao
in
the
federal
circuit
which
have
suggested
the
united
states
may
voluntarily
pay
out
that
money
is
incorrect.
the
united
states
is
under
an
obligation
to
pay
the
money
to
the
prime
contractor
that
earned
it.
if
it's
not
earned
under
the
contract,
it
may
not
be
paid
out.
does
that
answer
your
question?
i'm
sorry.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
okay.
because
respondent
seeks
a
payment
of
money
from
the
united
states
treasury,
respondent
has
the
obligation
of
pointing
to
a
statute
that
entitles
it
to
recover
that
money
from
the
united
states
or
authorizes
the--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--your
honor--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--in
our
view
it
would
be
an
action
for
money
damages.
it
would
not
constitute
specific
relief.
we
believe
that
there's
three
reasons
for
that.
the
first
and
the
most
simple,
in
the
facts
of
this
case,
the
actual
res,
the
actual
fund
to
which
the
lien
supposedly
attached,
has
been
dissipated.
it's
gone.
it
no
longer
exists.
even
at
common
law
it
was
recognized
that
once
the
funds
to
which
the
lien
allegedly
attached,
what
was
left
to
the
complainant
was
not
a
claim
for
specific
relief,
but
a
claim
for
damages,
a
claim...
a
general
claim
against
the
assets
of
the
debtor.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
even
if
you
had
notice
before
you
disbursed
the
fund.
what
was
left
was
a
general
claim.
you
would
lose...
for
example,
you
would
lose
your
priority
over
other
creditors.
all
that
was
left
was
a
claim
for
damages.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
that
is
correct.
it
would
be
a
very
simple
and
very
narrow
case
for
deciding
this
particular
case.
but
the
lower
courts
are
currently
struggling
with
very
broad
issues
that
come
out
of
the
court's
decision
in
bowen
and
section
702.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
pardon?
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
yes,
your
honor.
i
think
that
the
reason
we
asked
the
court
to
take
the
case
was
not
because
of
the
specific
narrow
problem
with
the
decision
below.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
whether
or
not
that...
yes,
whether
or
not
anyone
could
recover--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--i...
bowen
itself
wasn't
an
equitable
lien
case,
and
i
don't
believe
that
there
are
any
cases
from
this
court--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--not
that
i
know
of,
no.
not...
not
against
property
in
the
possession
of
the
government
that
the
government
itself
owned
in
advance.
the
only
possible
cases
i
could
think
of
that
would
be
contrary
are
cases
where
the
united
states
acquired
property
after
a
lien
had
been
imposed
on
it,
and
the
question
was,
did
the
united
states
acquire
greater
rights
than
the
transferor
that
transferred
the
property
to
it.
and
the
court
in
a
case
armstrong
v.
georgia,
i
believe
it
was...
the
name
was
armstrong...
held
that
the
united
states
cannot
get
greater
rights
than
the
transferor
itself
had.
but
in
no
case
has
this
court
ever
held
that
a
plaintiff
may
obtain
a
lien
on
united
states
funds
held
by
the
treasury.
in
fact,
in
case
after
case
it
has
held
that
the
united
states'
property
and
funds
are
not
subject
to
liens
and
are
not
subject
to
the
imposition
of
money
payment
obligations--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--no,
i
think
bowen
is
actually
quite
a
narrow
decision.
bowen--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--i
do
not
recall
a
statement
from
the
court
indicating
that
any
cause
of
action,
no
matter
what
basis,
was
now
viable
against
the
united
states
so
long
as
it
could
be
enforced
by
specific
means.
we
believe
that
was
the
basic
mistake
the
ninth
circuit
made
below.
it
read
the
1976
amendment
to
the
apa
as
in
effect
saying
that
any
cause
of
action
or
the
courts
could
impose
payment
obligations
on
the
treasury
so
long
as,
at
the
end
of
the
day,
the
mechanism
for
enforcing
that
payment
obligation
would
be
specific
relief
rather
than
money
damages.
this
court
has
made
clear
that
any
plaintiff
that
seeks
to
obtain
money
from
the
government
must
overcome
two
inherent
aspects
of
sovereignty.
one
is
the
immunity
of
the
united
states
to
suit,
due
to
the
fact
that
the
united
states
cannot
be
called
into
court
without
its
consent.
and
the
second
is
the
immunity
of
the
united
states'
property
and
funds
to
seizure,
liens,
and
encumbrances
without
congress'
express
consent.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
we
don't
believe
that
there
is
a
difference.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
and
in
fact,
it's...
if
this
very
claim
had
been
brought...
for
example,
if
verdan
had
asked
for
this
money
from
the
united
states
under
its
contract,
that
claim
itself
would
clearly
have
been
one
for
money
damages
under
the
contract.
if
respondent
had
sought
the
money
from
verdan
under
its
contract,
again
it
would
have
been
money
damages.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
we
believe
that
that
claim
also
would
not
be
viable
against
the
united
states,
that
it
too
would
have
been
a
claim
for
money
damages.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
it
would
be
surprising
to
surety
companies.
under
a...
under
the
federal...
well,
under
the
apa
they
would
not...
we
don't
believe
they'd
be
able
to...
they
would
not
be
able
to
prevail.
in
the
federal
circuit,
in
cases
that
we
believe
are
mistaken,
the
federal
circuit
has
described
that
action
that
the
surety
brings
as
a
contract
action
and
therefore
within
the
scope
of
the
waiver
of
immunity
of
the
tucker
act.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
excuse
me?
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
not
against
the
united
states.
pearlman
was
a
suit
between
a
surety
and
a
trustee
of
the
contractor,
and
the
united
states
had
already
parted
with
the
funds.
nowhere
in
pearlman
does
it
state
that
the...
that
the
surety
has
a
right
of
action
against
the
united
states.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
i
think
it's
very
important,
if
you
look
very
closely
at
the
court's
opinion,
the
basis
on
which
the
surety
is
able
to
prevail
over
the
contractor
is
that
it
is
asserting
the
rights
of
the
united
states.
it
is,
through
the
doctrine
of
subrogation,
stepping
into
the
shoes
of
the
united
states
and
asserting
the
right
to
the
funds
that
the
united
states
would
have
been
able
to
assert
against
the
contractor.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
no,
it
does
not.
it
specifically
excludes
contracts
implied
in
law.
only
contracts
implied
in
fact
may
be
brought
under
the
tucker
act.
in
fact,
that
this
court's
decision
i
think--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--i
think
that
is
correct.
that
is
our
position.
now,
the--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--the
court
actually
does
not
have
to
go
that
far.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
potentially
but
i
think
that
the...
this
particular
theory
that
the
court
of
federal
claims
has
proceeded
on
is
not
implicated
in
this
case.
the
court
of
federal
claims
has
said
that
the
surety
steps
into
the
shoes
of
the
prime
contractor
and
can
assert
the
prime
contractor's
contract
rights
against
the
united
states.
since
the
tucker
act
does
express
the
united...
waive
the
united
states
immunity
to
suit
and
allow
for
damages
for
breach
of
contract,
those
decisions
wouldn't
necessarily
be
called
into
question
by
this
court's
decision.
we
believe
that
they
are
incorrect.
as
a
matter
of
surety
law,
they're
upside
down,
but
they
are
not
necessarily
implicated
by
what
the
court
would
do
today.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
i
think
that
that...
the
legislative
history
quoted
there
can't
be
taken
literally
because
the
statute
itself
is
directly
to
the
contrary.
for
example,
the
statute
goes
on
and
says,
nothing
herein
affects
other
limitations
on
judicial
review
or
the
power
or
duty
of
the
court
to
dismiss
or
deny
relief
on
any
other
appropriate
legal
ground
or
confers
authority,
so
that--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--i...
i
would
disagree
with
that,
justice
souter,
for
two
reasons.
the
first
is
in
bowen
the
court
had
no
reason
to
consider
whether
or
not
section
702,
in
effect,
licensed
courts
to
create
rights
to
money
from
the
treasury
under
common
law
or
equitable
principles
because
in
that
case
there
was
a
statute
that
entitled
the
plaintiff
to
the
money.
and
it's
clear
that
congress
has
the
authority
to
create
that
right
to
the
money.
the
question
and
what
the
ninth
circuit
read
section
702
as
doing
is
creating
an
implied
authorization
for
the
courts
under
common
law
or
under
equitable
principles
to
create
a
right
to
the
money
where
congress
had
not
using
equitable
principles.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
justice
souter,
no,
i
don't
think
so.
i
think
that
it's
improper
given
the
fact
that
waivers
of
immunity
are
strictly
construed
and
especially
those
that
are
a
claim
to
create
money
payment
obligations
against
the
united
states,
i
think
it's
improper
to
read--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--no,
no.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
that's
correct,
but
what...
i
think
what
your
question
implies
is
that
the
exclusion
of
money
damages
implies
in
the
courts
the
power
to
create,
as
a
substantive
matter,
new
rights
to
money
so
long
as
in...
in
the
end
you
can
collect
the
money
without
it
being
money
damages.
and
that
is
a
leap
that
you
cannot
make.
and
i
think,
for
example,
united
states
v.
testan
is
a
very
good
example
of
that.
in
testan,
the
statute
specifically
stated
that
the
court
of
claims
would
have
jurisdiction
to
enter
judgments
on
claims
against
the
united
states
based
on,
among
other
things,
statutes.
this
court
held
that
as
a
matter
of
sovereign
immunity,
the
government's
immunity
to
suit,
the
ability
to
haul
the
united
states
into
court,
had
been
waived,
but
if
the
statute
did
not
take
the
further
step
of
creating
a
right
to
money
from
the
united
states
based
on
any
particular
statute.
and
so,
based
on...
if
there
was
a
simple
statutory
violation,
the
court
of
federal
claims
could
not
give
damages
for
that...
the
violation
of
the
statute.
it
could
only
give
money
for
the
violation
of
the
statute
if
the
statute
itself
provided
that
right.
the
same
thing
happened
again
in
nordic
village.
the
statute
waived
immunity,
saying
that
the
judgments
of
the
courts
would
bind
the
united
states,
but
since
the
statute
itself
did
not
expressly
state
that
the
court
could
create
new
money
payment
obligations
against
the
united
states,
this
court
held
that
it
applied
only
to
non-monetary
relief.
in
other
words,
what
the
courts
cannot
do
is
create
substantive
new
rights
to
money.
section
702
is
not
a
license
for
them
to
step
out
and
say,
well,
this
previous
right,
equitable
liens,
was
not
enforceable.
it
never
applied
to
the
united
states.
it
now
applies
as
a
substantive
matter.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
i
think,
your
honor,
that
section
702
does
not
authorize
the
courts
to
create
any
substantive
rights
at
all.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
that's
correct.
traditional
equity
principles
do
not
operate
against
the
united
states,
and
section
702
does
not
make
them
operate
against
the
united
states.
what
it
simply
says
is
where
you
have
a
right
to
relief
under
a
statute
or
some
other
force
of
law...
or
some
other
source
of
law
that
applies
to
the
united
states,
you
may
get
that
relief
so
long
as
the
relief
doesn't
constitute
money
damages.
if
it
does
constitute
money
damages,
you
should
go
to
the
tucker...
go
to
the
court
of
claims
under
the
tucker
act.
and
therefore...
so,
that...
that
is
the
very
mistake
we
believe
the
ninth
circuit
made.
it
read
section
702
as
an
implied
authorization,
and
it
doesn't
have
any
language
that
would
suggest
it's
an
implied
authorization
to
create
new
substantive
rights
to
money.
it
stands
in
contrast
to
example...
to
the
federal
tort
claims
act
which
has
express
language
both
waiving
the
united
states
immunity
to
suit
and
authorizing
courts
to
create
new
substantive
rights
to
money.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
there
is...
under
a
federal
circuit--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--the
contract
right--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--the
court
of
claims
says
that
contracts
create
that
right.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
that's
correct.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
i
don't
think
you
need
to
get
into
a
metaphysical
debate
as
to
whether
or
not
the
right
is
somehow
out
there
but
not
enforceable.
we
all
have
to
just...
the
only
thing
that
has
to
be
accepted
is
absent
the
express
statement
of
congress
that
equitable
rights
should
be
applying
to
the
united
states,
as
a
matter
of
law
they
don't.
section...
the
tucker
act...
under
the
tucker
act,
the
court
of
federal
claims
has
basically
read
the
ability
to
enforce
contract
claims
as
making
certain
rights
enforceable,
one
of
them
being
the
right
to
assert
the
rights
of
the
united
states
against
the
united
states
in
subrogation.
and
they
have
read
the
tucker
act
as
making
that
right
enforceable.
the
question
is
whether
702
actually
also
reaches
out
and
takes--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--well,
no,
i
understand
the
argument,
but
i
don't
think
that
702
says
that
substantive
rights
to
money
that
are
otherwise
not
enforceable
against
the
united
states
become
enforceable
simply
because
that
nature
of
that
right
would
be
specific
relief.
the...
the
only
thing
it
says
is
that
the
suit
shall
not
be
dismissed
on
the
grounds
that
it's
against
the
united
states.
it
overcomes
the
united
states'
immunity
to
suit,
but
it
does
not
take
the
further
and
necessary
step
of
making
the
united
states
substantively
liable
for
the
payment
of
money.
i
think
i
wanted
to
turn
very--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--absolutely,
your
honor.
we
would
disagree
with
that
emphatically,
and
we
believe
that
the
court's
cases,
including
martin
surety
and
pearlman,
support
our
view
that
the--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--the
usual
rule
is
what
the
surety
does
is
when
it
sees
a
breach,
it
goes
to
the
united
states
and
enters
into
what's
called
a
takeover
agreement.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
pardon?
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
well,
even
under
surety
law,
the...
it
cannot
assert
a
right
to
subrogation
unless
it
notifies
the
united
states
that
there
has
been
a
breach.
that...
that
obligation
exists
no
matter
what.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
there
was
no
performance
bond
in
this
case
either.
the
united
states
took
a
loss
on
this
contract.
to
quick...
to
turn
quickly,
the
last
point.
we
believe
that
because
this
is
a
lump
sum
payment
of
money
for
the
remedy
of
retroactive
past
harms,
it
is
by
definition
money
damages.
bowen
is
very
different
because
the
judgment
in
that
case
was
going
to
cover
ongoing
relationships
between
the
state
and
the
federal
government.
when
the
payment
is
a
simple,
naked
money
judgment
covering
past
wrongs,
we
believe
it
was
by
definition
money...
a
money
judgment--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--excuse
me...
money
damages.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
that
was
her
position,
and
she's...
and
her
specific
statement
was
there's
no
duty
here
which
may
be
specifically
enforced.
in
other
words,
the
united
states
has
no
duty
to
pay
the
subcontractor
which
may
be
specifically
enforced.
and
what
they've
attempted
to
do
is
plead
around
the
claim
which
was
basically
based...
and
if
you
look
at
the
complaint,
paragraph
19...
on
the
united
states'
failure
to
post
a
miller
act
bond.
if
there
are
no
further
questions
at
this
time,
i'll
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
the
basic
principle
that
we
believe
should
control
this
case
is
that
anybody
seeking
money
from
the
united
states
must
show
a
waiver
of
immunity
and
a
substantive
source
of
law
applicable
to
the
united
states
giving
them
a
right
to
the
money.
in
our
view,
neither
section
702
nor
pearlman
make
equity
a
source
of
substantive
law
applicable
to
the
united
states
that
gives
rise
to
the
right
to
money
from
the
treasury.
in
pearlman,
the
united
states
was
not
a
party
and
the
rights
that
were
recognized
were
rights
to
money
that
operated
against
only
other
private
parties.
in
fact,
in
opm
v.
richmond,
there
existed
in
that
very
case
a
waiver
of
immunity,
but
the
court
rejected
the
notion
that
the...
that
the
lower
federal
courts
could
create
a
right
to
money
under
the
theory
of
equitable
estoppel.
we
think
the
same
rule
applies
to
creating
rights
to
money
under
a
theory
of
equitable
liens.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
i
think
it
squarely
raises
that
question
for
two
reasons.
first,
the...
the
way
we
read
the
ninth
circuit
decision...
i
think
the
proper
way
to
read
it...
is
that
section
702
renders
certain
sources
of
law
applicable
to
the
united
states
and
create
the
liens,
so
that
section
702
in
a
real
sense
permits
people
to
assert--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--permits
or...
permits--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--that's
correct,
but
i
think
that
the
second
answer
is
that
that
in
fact
is
a
sovereign
immunity
issue
and
the
court
consistently
has
treated
the
creation
of
substantive
monetary
rights
against
the
united
states
as
an
issue
of
sovereign
immunity.
it
treated
it...
that
as
an
issue
of
sovereign
immunity
in
the
united
states
v.
testan.
it
created...
treated
it
as
an
issue
in
the
united
states
v.
nordic
village,
and
it
treated
it
again
as
an
issue
of
sovereign
immunity
in
united
states
v.
idaho
because
sovereign
immunity
has
two
inherent
components.
one
is
an
immunity
to
suit,
and
the
other
is
an
immunity
of
the
united
states'
property
and
its
funds
to
seizure
and
encumbrances.
and
any
plaintiff
seeking
to
get
money
from
the
treasury
must
overcome
both.
it
must
show
both
jurisdiction
in
the
federal
court
and
that
congress
has
affirmatively
intended
money
to
be
leaving
the
treasury
based
on
this
source
of
law.
and
i...
thank
you.
