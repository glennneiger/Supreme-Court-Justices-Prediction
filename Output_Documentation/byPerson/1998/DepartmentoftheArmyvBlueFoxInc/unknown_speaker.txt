unknown
speaker
mr.
lamken,
i
note
you're
getting
down
to
this
specific
case,
but
for
the
broad,
sweeping
proposition
you
announced
originally,
i'm
thinking
of
cases
like
westcott
v.
califano
where
congress
said
benefits
go
to
fathers
not
mothers,
and
this
court
said
that
such
a
statute...
its
constitutionality
could
be
saved
by
including
mothers
for
benefits,
for
unemployment
compensation
benefits.
how
does
that
fit
with
your
theory
that
unless
there's
a
specific
act
that
covers
this,
no
money
will
be
paid
from
the
treasury?
unknown
speaker
that's
something
maybe
a
lawyer
could
follow,
but
the
statute
said
unemployed
father
and
the
court
said
unemployed
mothers
will
be
paid
under
this
statute
as
well.
unknown
speaker
but
you
could
have
that
kind
of
loose
interpretation
of
a
statute
that
would
accommodate
the
kind
of
case
i
just
described.
unknown
speaker
you
could...
you
said
absent
a
statute,
but
you
just
described
a
statute
that
on
its
face
doesn't
cover
something,
but
will
be
construed
by
a
court
to
cover
something
and
that
fits
within
your
theory.
unknown
speaker
no
such
problem
is
raised...
involved
here,
is
it?
unknown
speaker
in
this...
in
this
case
before
the
army
paid
verdan
in
1994,
could
it
have
said,
you
know,
we
have
86,000
dollars
we're
going
to
pay
verdan,
but
we
have
notice
that
blue
fox
hasn't
been
paid?
we're
going
to
put
this
money
into
a...
a
court
escrow
account
and...
and
allow
blue
fox
to
make
its
claim
in
court.
could
you
have
done
that?
unknown
speaker
but
couldn't
they
have
said
the
contractor
was
in
default
because
it
didn't
post
a
bond?
unknown
speaker
could
not
the
contractor
have
been
in
default
for
failure
to
post
a
bond
under
the
miller
act?
unknown
speaker
not
as
much
as
the
stretch
as
that
case
was,
though.
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
because
it's
clear
they...
oh,
you
did
dispute
at
one
time
whether
there
was
a
bond
obligation,
didn't
you?
unknown
speaker
well,
wasn't
verdan
in
default
for
not
having
paid
blue
fox?
unknown
speaker
but,
i
mean,
it
all
depends
on
whether
you
declare
there's
a
default?
unknown
speaker
well,
if
you...
if
you
have
the...
the
discretion...
let's
assume
there
were
facts
here
that
would
have
allowed
you
to
declare
a
default...
to
pay
the
money
into...
into
a
fund
where
interpleader
is
allowed,
which
is
ultimately
going
to
allow
blue
fox
to...
to
obtain
the
money,
then
there's
no
really
appropriations
problem,
is
there?
unknown
speaker
so,
you...
could
you
have
paid
blue
fox
directly?
unknown
speaker
simply
because
you
need
a
court
order?
there's
a
difference
in
your
doing
it
voluntarily
and
having
a
court
order?
unknown
speaker
but
i
thought
you
just
said
it
could
be
paid
into
an
interpleader
fund
if
you
declared
default.
unknown
speaker
well,
that
was
true
here.
you
paid
verdan
twice,
86,000
dollars
once
and
84,000
dollars
later.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
what's
the
nature
of
a
recovery
in
a
suit
to
enforce
an
equitable
lien?
unknown
speaker
is
it
specific
relief
or...
or
what?
unknown
speaker
even
if
you
had
notice
before
you
disbursed
the
fund?
unknown
speaker
if
that
is
correct,
that
would
be
a
simple
basis
for
deciding
the
case.
so,
you
don't
have
to
get
into
all
this
appropriations
clause
business,
do
you?
unknown
speaker
which
you'd
like
us
to
decide
even
if
not
necessary
to
dispose
of
this
case.
unknown
speaker
which
you
would
like
us
to
decide
even
though
not
necessary
to
dispose
of
this
case
if
you're
right
on
the
point
you
just
made.
unknown
speaker
that
was
the
question
presented
in
the
petition
for
certiorari,
the
more
general
one,
was
it
not?
unknown
speaker
--respondents
to
bring
an
action
in
federal
district
court
for
an
equitable...
is
bowen
the
only
authority
for
an
equitable
lien
against
the
government?
unknown
speaker
are
there
any
cases
from
this
court
authorizing
an
equitable
lien
against
the
government?
unknown
speaker
but
bowen
did
say,
didn't
it,
although
it
wasn't
dealing
specifically
with
equitable
liens,
that
the...
that
the
time
had
come
to
stop
recognizing
sovereign
immunity
with
respect
to...
to
equitable
claims?
i
mean,
that's
in
bowen,
isn't
it?
whether...
whether
it
was
too
broad
a
statement,
we
can
argue
about,
but
isn't
that
what
the
court
said?
unknown
speaker
i'm
talking
about
what
the
court
said.
didn't
the
court
say
something
in
substance
like
what
i...
i
just
said
to
you?
unknown
speaker
well,
in
this
case
what's
the
difference
between
a
recovery
of
damages
and
a
recovery
of
the
kind
of
specific
relief
that
the
ninth
circuit
said
you
could
recover?
unknown
speaker
there
isn't
much,
is
there?
unknown
speaker
suppose
a
surety
had
paid
the
subcontractor
and
then
tried
to
get
the
money.
unknown
speaker
would
that
position
be
surprising
to
the
surety
companies?
unknown
speaker
but
isn't...
doesn't
our
pearlman
case
establish
that
the
sureties
can
recover?
unknown
speaker
the
pearlman
case
that
came
from
this
court,
justice
black's
decision?
unknown
speaker
why
isn't
that
an
implied
contract?
when
it
says
implied
contract
in
the
tucker
act,
does
that
include
restitution
of
contracts
implied
by
law?
unknown
speaker
so,
that's
actually
what
you're
after
in
this
case.
your...
your
theory
in
this
case
is
there
is
no...
there
is...
you
cannot
assert
a
claim,
an
equitable
claim,
against
some
money.
nobody
can
without
a
statute
specifically
saying
it.
you
can't
do
it
under
restitution
law,
and
therefore
sureties
simply
can't
recover
against
the
united
states
unless
congress
takes
some
action.
unknown
speaker
that's
pretty--
unknown
speaker
--no,
no.
but
i
mean,
the
next
thing,
as
soon
as
we
decide
this,
you'll
go
back
to
the
court
of
claims
and
say
their
court...
their
cases
are
wrong
and
get
that
up
here,
and
that's
part
two
and
then
it's
over.
is
that--
unknown
speaker
--well,
following
justice
breyer's
question,
going
back
to
my
earlier
colloquy
with
you,
what
i
was
trying
to
get
at
and
not
remembering
very
precisely
was
this.
i've
got
bowen
in
front
of
me.
at...
at
899,
justice
stevens
quoted
from
judge
bork
in
the
court
of
appeals
there
in...
in
characterizing
the
legislative
history.
the
quotation
includes
this.
both
reports
go
on
to
say
that
the
time
has
now
come
to
eliminate
the
sovereign
immunity
defense
in
all
equitable
actions
for
specific
performance
against
a
federal
agency
or
officer
acting
in
an
official
capacity.
and
this
court
then,
at
the
end
of...
of
that
quotation
and...
and
much
more,
said
thus
the
combined
effect
of
the
1970
hearing
and
the
1976
legislative
material
is
to
demonstrate
conclusively
that
the
exception
for
an
action
seeking
money
damages
should
not
be
broadened
beyond
the
meaning
of
the
plain
language.
if
we
follow
that
rationale,
it
seems
to
me
that
we
would
have
difficulty
in
accepting
your...
your
very
starchy
position
that
if
there
is
otherwise
an
accepted
equitable
basis
for
going
after
the
res,
that
would
still
be
impossible
under
this
statute.
it
seems
to
me
if
we
accept
that
rationale,
it...
it
would
be
perfectly
possible,
in
fact,
the
only
thing
that
we
could
do.
you
might
still
win,
by
the
way,
because
the
res
was
gone.
i'm
not
saying...
casting
any
doubt
on
that
point.
but
on
the
legal
theory
or
the
equitable
theory,
it
seems
to
me
you...
you
would
have
a
tough
row
to
hoe
if
we
accept
what...
what
we
wrote
in
bowen.
unknown
speaker
well,
that's...
that's...
that's
right,
but...
but
that
leaves
open
the
question
what
grounds
would
be
considered
binding
or
legitimate
after
this...
this
act
is...
is
passed.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
in...
in
bowen
at
least,
this
court
thought
that
the
kind
of
equitable
claim
that
is
being
made
here,
leaving
aside
the
problem
of
exhaustion
of
the
res,
would
be
a
claim
that
was
no
longer
precluded.
unknown
speaker
well,
of
course,
that's...
that's
very
true,
but
the...
the
fact
is
that
the
only
language
that...
that
congress
used
in...
in...
in
the
section
702
amendment
was
the
money
damages
language,
and
the
money
damages
language,
if
it
is
read
in
a
straightforward
and
plain
fashion,
would
certainly
authorize
what
the
court
was
doing
here,
assuming
there
was
anything
for
equity
to
attach.
unknown
speaker
then
the
court
should
simply...
then
the
congress
should
simply
have
said
money.
unknown
speaker
it
said
money
damages.
unknown
speaker
702
can't
do--
--just...
just
one
last
question.
is
it
your
position
that...
that
under
the
702
language
as
amended,
no
equitable
right
could
be
recognized
which
is
not
otherwise
authorized
by
statute
or
only
an
equitable
right
which
would
require
the
payment
of
money?
unknown
speaker
so,
the
answer
would
be
no
equitable
right
could
be
recognized
regardless
of
traditional
equity
principles.
unknown
speaker
now,
that's...
that's
going
to
be
a
hard
theory,
isn't
it?
the...
i
take
it
that
here
there
is
an
ongoing
right,
whether
mistaken
or
not,
for
the
surety
of
an
unpaid
sub
to
assert
a
claim
against
a
fund
held
by
the
united
states
insofar
as
that
fund
represents
money
earned
by
but
not
yet
paid
to
the
general
contractor.
unknown
speaker
yes,
all
right.
unknown
speaker
there
is
that
kind
of
right.
so,
it
isn't
702
that
anyone
says
created
that
right.
it's
there
in
the
law,
and
it
wouldn't...
i
mean,
the
court
of
claims
says
there
is
such
a
right.
unknown
speaker
fine.
unknown
speaker
so...
so,
now
how
could
we
say,
unless...
we'd
either
have
to
say
although
the
surety
has
that
right,
the
principal
doesn't,
or
we'd
have
to
decide
whether
that
right
really
exists
or
not
before
we
could
say
that
you
haven't
created
one
out
of
702
because,
you
see,
there
is
one
out
there
independently
of
702.
unknown
speaker
no.
you
would
say
the
question
under
702
is
whether
this
right,
which
the
court
of
claims
says
exists
in
respect
to
sureties...
and
let's
imagine
exists
there
in
respect
to
subs...
can
be
enforced
in
a
federal
district
court
because
to
enforce
it
in
a
federal
district
court
is
not
to
assert
a
claim
for
money
damages,
but
is
rather
to
assert
a
claim
for
the
thing
itself,
namely
the
payment
out
of
the
pre-existing
fund.
i
mean,
that...
that
would
be
the
logic
of
it,
wouldn't
it?
nobody
is
saying
702
creates
the
substantive
right.
702
permits
you
to
enforce
in
a
district
court
that
right
which
has
been...
that...
well,
i
don't--
unknown
speaker
--one
thing.
i
thought
you
disagreed
with
the...
in
this
court
you
would
disagree
that
the
surety
would
have
a
right
against
a
fund
that
the
government
is
holding
and
has
not
paid
to
the
prime
contractor.
unknown
speaker
how
does
the...
if
that
view
prevails,
how
does
the
surety
protect
itself
as
a
practical
matter
against
just
what
happened
here?
unknown
speaker
in
other
words,
it
just
has
to
audit
performance
on
a
constant
basis.
unknown
speaker
it
has
to
audit
performance
on
a
constant
basis.
unknown
speaker
i
know
there
was
no
miller
act
bond.
was
there
a
performance
bond?
unknown
speaker
that
was
judge--
unknown
speaker
--judge
rymer's
position,
wasn't
it,
that
this
is
a...
this
is
a
claim
for
money
damages?
it's
been
artfully
pled.
unknown
speaker
very
well,
mr.
lamken.
mr.
spaulding,
we'll
hear
from
you.
unknown
speaker
which...
which
funds
are
we
talking
about?
the
first
payment?
because
there
was
a
takeover
contractor
that
the
funds
were
paid
to
in
the
end.
unknown
speaker
so,
which...
which
money
are
we
talking
about?
unknown
speaker
they
would
be
making
the
same
argument,
but...
but
in
these
circumstances,
they
don't
have
to.
they...
they
have
an
additional
argument,
which
is
that
there
just
ain't
no
fund
there.
there
might
have
been
a
fund
when
you
wrote
the
initial
letter,
but
by
the
time
you
brought
the
lawsuit,
what
was
the
fund
that
you
were
seeking
to...
to
obtain?
unknown
speaker
where
does
this
fund
exist?
i
mean,
it...
it
didn't
exist
in
the...
all
the
authorized
money
had
been
spent.
unknown
speaker
where...
where
is
this
fund
other
than
in
the
general
treasury?
i
mean,
is
the
whole
general
treasury
is
an
equitable
fund
for
your
attachment?
unknown
speaker
it
had
been
spent.
all
of
the
authorized
money
had
been
spent,
hadn't
it?
unknown
speaker
no,
it
is
not.
it's...
i
mean,
no.
your...
your
lien
theory
is
that
there
is
an
object
to
which
your
lien
attaches,
and
that
object
was
gone
when
the
money
was
paid
out.
it
seems
to
me
you're
making
two
arguments.
you're
saying
there
was
an
equitable
lien
against
the
res,
the
money,
and
there
was
also
an
equitable
obligation
on
the
part
of
the
government
not
to
do...
not
to
dispose
of
that
thing
the
minute
we
put
the
government
on
notice.
it
seems
to
me
you're
making
two
separate
claims,
aren't
you?
and...
and
your...
your...
they're
independent
claims.
you
may
well
be
right
on...
on
the
lien
theory.
i
don't
see
the
basis
on
which
you
are
necessarily
right
against
the
government
prior
to
getting
a
court
order
to
enforce
it
on
your
second
theory.
unknown
speaker
what
would
be
the
authority
for
doing
that,
to
run
into
federal
court
and
file
a...
an
action
for
a
tro
against
the
government?
unknown
speaker
i
don't
see
that.
but
i
don't
see
that
having
made
that
assumption.
i
mean,
there's
the
contract
and
the
contract
is
with
the
prime
contractor.
it
seems
to
me
that
you're...
you're
trying
to
create
a
contract
running
between
the
united
states
and
the
subcontractor
that
doesn't
exist
and
then
saying,
and
even
better,
not
only
do
we
have
a
contract,
but
it's
secured.
now,
of
course,
we
have
to
wait
to
see
that
the...
that
the
prime
contractor
is
going
to
default,
but
we
have
created
a
contract
between
the
subcontractor
and
the
united
states.
that's
what
it
seems
to
me
you've
done,
and
i
don't
see
how
you
get
to
that.
unknown
speaker
i
mean,
what
law?
you're
talking...
you
could
talk
about
tort
law,
contract
law,
by
operation
of
law.
it
seems
to
me
this
is
government
contract.
so,
contract
is
the
most
natural
body
of
law
at
which
to
look,
but
what
other
law
if
not
contract
law?
unknown
speaker
but
common
law
is
also
contract
law,
tort
law,
property
law.
so,
what--
--are
you
talking
about
cases
like
pearlman
and--
unknown
speaker
--certainly
the
government
wasn't
involved
in
either
of
those
cases.
i
mean,
the
government
was
not
a
party
in
either
of
them,
was
it?
unknown
speaker
and
isn't
that
true
of
henningsen
too?
the
government
was
not
a
party?
unknown
speaker
well,
but
the
government...
you
know,
when
you're
dealing
with
a...
with
a
body
that
has
sovereign
immunity,
you
just
don't
likely
say
they
were
a
stakeholder
unless
there
is
some
authority.
you
would
have
been
entirely
protected
if
there
had
been
a
miller
act
bond
here,
would
you
not?
unknown
speaker
and...
and
i
take
it
your
client
knew
that
there
was
no
miller
act
bond
when
you
came
in?
unknown
speaker
there's
no
bond.
unknown
speaker
why
not?
hadn't
there
been
a
dispute
and
the
government
finally
said,
well,
we're
going
to
classify
this
as
a
service
contract
and
therefore
service
contracts
don't
come
under
the
miller
act?
wasn't
that
known
that
this...
that
this
contractor
had
been
classified
as
a
service
contract?
unknown
speaker
well,
how
would
you
find
out
whether
this
was
typed
a
construction
contract
or
a
service
contract?
unknown
speaker
but
that's
not...
i'm
asking
you
the
question.
i...
i
want
to
know
whether
a
particular
contract
has
been
typed
by
the
government
a
service
contract
and
therefore
not
under
the
miller
act
or
a
contract
that
is
subject
to
the
miller
act.
how
would
i
find
that
out
if
i
wanted
just
that
information?
unknown
speaker
so,
just
by
looking
at
the
number
on
the
contract,
if
i
were
in
this
business,
i
would
know
that.
unknown
speaker
yes,
and
i
could
understand
if
you
say
we
have...
the
united
states
committed
a
tort.
it
didn't
insist
on
a
miller
act
bond
when
it
should
have
and
my
client
was
hurt.
and
then
my
question
is,
yes,
but
there's
the
federal
tort
claims
act
and
this
doesn't
seem
to
come
under
it.
unknown
speaker
but
where
does
that
come
from?
let...
let
me
make
an
heroic
assumption.
go
back
to
june
15th,
all
right,
and
at
that
point
you've
written
your
letter.
and
let's
imagine
that
there
is
a
fund
at
that
time,
which
fund
represents
money
that
the
government
has
set
aside
to
pay
the
contractor
for
work
already
performed,
but
it
has
not
yet
been
paid.
and
your
client
is
not
paid,
the
sub.
and
i
will
assume
heroically
that
if
that
fund
existed,
the
later
disbursement
of
the
fund
doesn't
matter
because
equity
presumes
to
have
been
done
what
should
have
been
done,
and
therefore
it
reconstitutes
the
fund.
now,
on
that
heroic
assumption,
what
is
the
source
of
law
that
says
that
you
are
entitled
to
assert
your
equitable
lien?
for
i
take
it
that
the
government
argues,
well,
702
may
waive
sovereign
immunity
for
whatever...
i
don't
know...
i
won't
put
this
argument
in
their
mouths.
i'll
make
it.
that...
but
nonetheless,
there
has
to
be
a
source
of
law
somewhere.
there
has
to
be
a
statute
or
something
because
702
can't
make
up
an
equitable
right
where
none
exists,
and
the
fact
that
private
contractors
or
subs
have
such
a
right
is
beside
the
point
when
you
deal
with
the
government
because
there
is
no
general
statute
that
says
equitable
principles
automatically
apply
to
the
government.
and
we
have
to
find
a
source
of
law.
so,
since
702
can't
be
that
source
of
law,
what
is?
unknown
speaker
pearlman.
unknown
speaker
oh,
my
goodness,
you
know,
what
they've
done
in
the
court
of
claims
on
that
is
that
they've
said
that
the
surety,
rather
than
being
subrogated
to
the
rights
of
the
sub,
which
is
what
normal
subrogation
is
about,
somehow
falls
into
the
shoes
of
the
contractor
prime
and
can
sue
on
the
basis
of
the
contract
with
the
government.
that's
my
understanding
of
it.
now,
if
i'm
right
on
that
understanding,
that
wouldn't
even
help
you
aside
from
the
fact
that...
aside
from
the
fact
that
that's
a
rather
dubious
theory.
i
mean,
how
did
they
get
from
the
rights
of
the
sub
to
put
him
in
the
shoes
of
the
prime.
i
don't
know
how
they
did
that.
i'm
not
sure
i'm
right
on
that,
but
i'm
not
sure,
even
if
that's
right,
how
that
would
help
you
because
you
don't
have
a
contract
with
any
government
on
any
theory.
unknown
speaker
where
did
pearlman
find
the...
the
source
of
the
equitable
right
against
the
government?
you
just
made
it
up?
unknown
speaker
so,
your
answer
to
what
they're
saying
about
the
source
of
law
is
pearlman
is
the
source
of
law.
all
we're
concerned
about
is
whether
702
permits
you
to
enforce
that
law
in
a
federal
district
court.
unknown
speaker
you
can't
really
rely
on
pearlman
or
henningsen
except
perhaps
by
analogy
because
the
government
was
not
a
party
to
either
of
those
cases.
unknown
speaker
we're
not
bound
by
court
of
claims
cases
here.
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
there
are
lots
of
rights
that
can't
be
enforced
because
of
sovereign
immunity.
unknown
speaker
could
you
just
put
a
regular
materialman's
lien
on...
on
the
government's
building?
unknown
speaker
well,
why?
unknown
speaker
that
was
the
whole
reason
for
the
miller
act,
wasn't
it,
was
that
you
couldn't
get
a
lien
against
government
property
of
a
materialman?
and
so,
the
idea
was
to
have
a
surety
come
in
and
guarantee
the
payments.
unknown
speaker
what
is
the...
what
is
the
source
of
the
lien
that
you're
claiming?
is
it
a
state
law
source?
unknown
speaker
it's
a
pearlman
source.
unknown
speaker
and
that...
that
has
its
origin
in...
in
federal
equity
law?
unknown
speaker
well,
although
we
haven't
done...
recognized
it
for
decades,
could
we
by
a
like
authority
recognize
a
federal
materialman's
lien?
unknown
speaker
in
other
words,
what
i'm
getting
at
is...
is
your
answer
to
justice
kennedy,
an
answer
which
really
divides
this
case
from...
from
the
others,
from
the
materialman's
case.
unknown
speaker
where
did
the
federal
equitable
lien
come
from?
some
judge
thought
it
up.
why
can't
some
judge
think
up
a
materialman's
lien?
unknown
speaker
so
then
wouldn't
it
make
sense,
if
you
accept
pearlman...
now,
i
don't
know
the...
say,
okay,
maybe
pearlman
gives
you
this
equitable
right.
let's
assume
heroic
assumption
number
two,
we're
not
so
heroic.
all
right,
assume
that.
then
say,
but
all
right,
when
somebody
asserts
that
right
against
a
fund,
they're
really
asking
for
money,
and
because
they're
asking
for
money,
they
better
go
to
the
court
of
claims
because
this
is
a
kind
of
government
contracting
matter
that
the
court
of
claims
is
good
at.
then
your
contrary
authority
is
bowen,
and
then
i
think
what
the
government
says
is,
no,
bowen
was
a
special
situation,
a
situation
in
which
you
had
an
ongoing
financial
relationship
over
a
long
period
of
time
between
a
state
and
the
federal
government
with
money
passing
back
and
forth
nonstop
every
minute,
and
that's
different.
what
do
you
think
of
that?
unknown
speaker
so,
the
pearlman
claim
is
not
contract-based.
unknown
speaker
by
operation
of
what
law?
unknown
speaker
if
i
were
going
to
type
that,
would
i
say,
well,
it...
it
belongs
in
the
realm
of
secured
contract
law
as
opposed
to
some
other
kind
of
law?
unknown
speaker
and
i
hear
all
of
these
descriptions
of
this
case,
but...
as
equitable,
but
as
i
see
it,
at
its
core
what's
happening
is
the
subcontractor
says
when
the
contractor
defaults
and
doesn't
pay
us,
at
that
point
we
have
a
direct
right
of
action
against
the
united
states
for
the
money
that
the
contractor
should
have
paid
us.
that's
really
what
it
is,
and
then
you
can
put
all
kinds
of
labels
on
it,
but
isn't
that
what
it
is,
that
you
have
a
right
to
money
from
the
united
states
when
the
contractor
defaults?
unknown
speaker
this
happens
all
the
time
when
people
are
confronted
with
the
defense
of
sovereign
immunity.
that's
the
whole
beauty
of
the
defense.
it
lets
the
government
get
off
when
the
government
ought
to
pay.
that's
what
it's
all
about.
i
mean,
the
fact
that...
that...
you
know.
it's
just
not
persuasive
as
to
the
issue
that's
before
us.
it's
whether
the
government
can
get
away
with
not
paying
what
it
ought
to
pay.
that's
the
whole
issue.
unknown
speaker
well,
but
you've
already
conceded
that
702
doesn't
give
you
the
underlying
right.
so,
we're
back
to
that
old
question
again.
unknown
speaker
but
that's
under
a
post
office
statute
that
has
a
sue-or-be-sued
provision,
and
it's
just
not
the
same
as
the
united
states,
eo
nomine,
as
we
say.
the
post
office
has
a
special
statute
governing
its...
its
immunity.
unknown
speaker
mr.
spaulding,
i
may
be
a
little
rusty
in
my
memory
of
702,
but
i
thought
the
prime
thing
that
motivated
that
provision
was
that
the
united
states
should
not
have
sovereign
immunity
available
to
it
in
non-monetary
claims.
now,
they
did
use
the
word
money
damages,
but
i
thought
that
the
whole
thrust
of
that
act
was
when
you're
seeking
relief
other
than
money
from
the
government,
the
government
shouldn't
have
the
defense
of
sovereign
immunity,
that
it
waived
immunity
for
non-monetary
claims.
i
don't
see
anything
in
the
history
of
702
that
indicates
congress
was
thinking
about,
yes,
this
waiver
applies
when
money
is
involved.
unknown
speaker
i...
yes,
i
know
what...
what
bowen
said,
but
as
far
as
what
drove
702,
wasn't
it
that
the
united
states
should
not
have
sovereign
immunity
for
non-monetary
relief?
in
the...
in
the
congressional
history
of...
of
what
led
to
702,
it
was
the
united
states
using
sovereign
immunity
when
there
was
no
pocketbook
claim
at
stake.
unknown
speaker
is...
is
there
something
in
the
legislative
history
of
702
that
indicates
they
were
thinking
in
terms
of
monetary
relief
that
could
be
characterized
as
equitable
rather
than
legal?
unknown
speaker
if...
ordinarily,
you
know,
you
get
a
judgment
for
money
damages.
then
the
damages
are
transferred
from
the
defendant
to
the
plaintiff.
how
is
this
any
different
from
money
damages?
unknown
speaker
yes.
i
didn't
agree
with
bowen
at
the
time.
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
but
if
bowen
applies
here,
then
bowen
applies
in
702,
et
cetera,
applies
whenever
there's
a
specified
fund
of
money
that
the
government
has.
but
if
that's
so,
then
many
court
of
claims
cases...
many,
perhaps
most...
will
suddenly
be
dissipated
throughout
the
9
or
10
or
12
or
13
circuits,
and
there
goes
the
exclusive
jurisdiction
of
the
court
of
claims,
which
seems
counterproductive.
all
right.
now,
i've
just
made
a
statement.
it's
really
a
question.
what
do
you
think?
well,
it's
even
worse
than
that.
well,
i
mean,
what
i
want
to
know
is
that...
what's
his
response
to
that.
unknown
speaker
but
you
have
to
argue
to
the
contrary
on
that.
so,
what...
what
is
your
contrary?
unknown
speaker
i
know
but,
you
see--
unknown
speaker
--bowen
seems...
if
bowen
doesn't
apply
here
and
we
treat
this
as
money
damages,
you've
had
it.
right?
unknown
speaker
okay.
but
i
say
if
bowen
does
apply
here,
then
we've
suddenly
got
bowen
applied
to
any
fund
of
money
held
by
the
government,
and
if
we
have
that,
then
suddenly
the
court
of
claims
jurisdiction
that
seems
to
be
exclusive
dissipates.
and
that's
a
bad
result
of
agreeing
with
you.
so,
i
want
you
to
comment
on
why,
nonetheless,
we
should
agree
with
you.
why
am
i
wrong
in
other
words?
unknown
speaker
restitution.
unknown
speaker
thank
you,
mr.
spaulding.
unknown
speaker
mr.
lamken,
you
have
2
minutes
remaining.
unknown
speaker
may
i
just
ask
one
question
about
the
phrasing
of
the
question
presented
in
your
cert
petition?
it
asks
whether
section
702
permits
respondent
to
bring
an
action,
so
forth
and
so
on,
which
seems
to
me
to
raise
squarely
the
sovereign
immunity
question
whether
this
is
a
money
damage
case
or
not.
i
don't
see
that
it
raises
the
question
whether
there's
any
other
source
of...
of
law
that
would
support
the
claim.
unknown
speaker
well,
it
should
have
been
permits
or
authorizes.
unknown
speaker
but
you're
saying
that
they
read
it
as
an
authorization
statute,
not
merely
as
a
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity.
