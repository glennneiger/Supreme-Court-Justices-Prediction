mr.
thomas
f.
spaulding
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
my
client
was
in
a
dilemma.
it
was
under
contract
to
continue
to
perform
the
work.
it
had
no
choice
but
to
keep
working.
on
the
other
hand,
verdan
wasn't
paying
it.
it
had...
it
did
the
only
thing
it
could
do
which
was
write
to
the
government
and
say,
please
either
pay
us
or
withhold
or
suspend
the
payments
to
verdan.
i
think
it's
important
to
recognize
here
that
the
government's
position
mixes
the
merits
and
the
jurisdiction
up.
the...
for
purposes
of
the
jurisdictional
issue,
we
should
look
at
the
funds'
still
being
there
as
of
the
date
blue
fox
wrote
the
letter
because--
mr.
thomas
f.
spaulding
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
f.
spaulding
we're
talking
about
the
first
one.
if
none
of
these
[$]
86,000
had
gone
to
verdan,
if
it
was...
if
that
money
was
all
still
there,
assume
it
had
been
enjoined
or
the
government
had
stopped...
the
government
would
be
making
the
same
argument
here,
that
what
we're
asking
for
is
money
damages.
so,
i
don't
really
think
it's
the...
it's
the
point
that,
well,
the
money
is
all
gone
now,
and
so
therefore,
you
know,
getting
money
from
a
different
source
would
be
money
damages.
mr.
thomas
f.
spaulding
well,
i...
i
would
disagree,
your
honor.
the...
the
money
is...
is
there
until
the
comptroller
general
balances
the
books,
and
they
have
5
years
within
which
to
do
that,
to...
for
example,
the
reason...
the
government
says
the
fund
is
depleted,
but
it
paid
out
well
over
[$]
100,000
to
verdan
for
the
construction
part
of
this
contract.
those
were
unauthorized
payments,
but
yet
it
relies
on
those,
bootstraps
its
argument
on
those
unauthorized
payments--
mr.
thomas
f.
spaulding
--well--
mr.
thomas
f.
spaulding
--no,
your
honor.
it's...
congress
appropriates
money
for
these...
obviously
for
these
projects
after
passing
an
authorizing
statute.
so,
the
money
is
there.
it's...
it's...
it's
been--
mr.
thomas
f.
spaulding
--your
honor,
the
money
here
is
a
form
of
bookkeeping
entries
in
terms
of...
the
monies...
the
money--
mr.
thomas
f.
spaulding
--well,
your
honor,
assuming
for
the
sake
of
argument,
if
that's
the
court's
holding,
i
think
what
would
happen,
if
the
only
reason
this
is
money
damages
is
that
would
send
a
signal
to
every
construction
lawyer
to
run
into
federal
district
court
to
file
a
tro
as
soon
as
a
payment
is
missed,
or
even
if
the...
your
client--
mr.
thomas
f.
spaulding
--well,
your
honor,
assuming,
as
we
have
to
for
the
sake
of
the
argument
here,
is
that
the
subcontractor
has
rights
to
the
funds,
as
we
were
discussing
earlier,
that
if
the
surety
has
these
rights,
the
subcontractor
himself
has--
mr.
thomas
f.
spaulding
--well,
your
honor,
there's
a
premise
to
your
question
which
is
at
the
basis
of
our
rights
are
in
contract,
and
that's
not
correct.
the
basis
of
our
rights
arise
by
operation
of
law.
we
have
the
right
to
the
fund
for
the
very
reason
that...
that
the
sureties
have
that
right.
i
mean,
the
sureties'
rights
to
subrogation--
mr.
thomas
f.
spaulding
--this
is
federal
common
law,
your
honor,
which
has
been
recognized
by
this
court--
mr.
thomas
f.
spaulding
--yes,
your
honor.
we're
talking
about
pearlman
and
henningsen
where
they...
they
recognized
that
there
are
equitable
obligations
of
the
government
or
of
the
owner.
mr.
thomas
f.
spaulding
no.
in...
in
the
pearlman
case,
the...
the
money
was
actually
in
the
hands
of
the
trustee
in
bankruptcy.
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
f.
spaulding
the
government
was
not
a
party,
but
there...
these
cases
are
important
for
purposes
of...
i
mean,
i
think
they
shed
light
on
the
appropriations
issue
here
to,
is
that
the
money
was
available.
and...
and
in
this
case,
i
would
submit
that
the
government
was
a
stakeholder
in
this
case.
and
certainly
in
all
the
suretyship
cases,
that's
the
rule
that
the...
this
money
doesn't
belong
to
the
government
anymore.
mr.
thomas
f.
spaulding
in
this
case,
yes,
your
honor,
we
would
have
been.
mr.
thomas
f.
spaulding
no.
no,
he
did
not,
your
honor.
he
did
what
most
construction
contractors
do.
my
client
is
an
experienced
federal
construction
contractor,
and
he
assumed
that
the
law
was
complied
with,
and
i
think
he's
entitled
to
that
presumption.
and
then
when
he
didn't
get
paid,
he
started
calling
around
and...
and
found
out,
you
know,
who's
this
guy's
bonding
company,
and
he
found
out
right
around
june
15th
that
there
was
no
bond
here.
mr.
thomas
f.
spaulding
of
course,
nobody
from
the
sba
or
the
army
ever
told
him
about
that,
notwithstanding--
mr.
thomas
f.
spaulding
--well,
no
one
told
my
client
that,
your
honor,
and
it
was...
obviously,
if...
if
he
would
have
obtained
the
whole
contract
and
read
the
whole
thing,
that
would
have
been
said
there,
but...
i
mean,
the--
mr.
thomas
f.
spaulding
--well,
it...
in
order
to
come
up
with
the
bonding
requirement,
one
needs
to...
to...
at
least
what
the
thinking
was
in
the
army
and
the
sba
at
the
time,
what
we
need
to
do
is
first
classify
either
services
or
construction.
we
only
need
to
get
the
bond
if
it's
a
construction.
now,
what
the
ninth
circuit
characterized
as
conscious
avoidance
of
the
miller
act
was
going
on
here
because
the...
they
didn't
want--
mr.
thomas
f.
spaulding
--i
think
probably,
your
honor,
somewhere
there's
the
standard
industrial
classification,
sic,
codes
and
1731
is
construction.
if
it's
the
4833,
it's...
it's
for
services.
but
the
point
here
is--
mr.
thomas
f.
spaulding
--i...
i
believe
so,
your
honor,
that...
that
somewhere
in
the...
if
not
in
the
contract
itself,
certainly
in
the...
in
the...
the
documents
that
the
contracting
agency
generates,
they
have
to
assign
a
sic
code
to
this.
but
that...
that
isn't
determinative
as
far
as
a...
whether
a
miller
act
bond
is
required.
i
mean,
miller
act...
the
statute
says
that
a
bond
is
required
for
any
contract.
mr.
thomas
f.
spaulding
no.
and...
and
that's
not
our
claim
at
all,
your
honor.
we're
not
saying
that...
that
please
remedy
our
loss
because
of
the
government's
misconduct
in
not
getting
a
miller
act
bond.
that's
not
our
claim.
nor
is
our
claim
a
contract
based
claim
that...
that
we're...
we're
entitled
to
the
monies
that
verdan
was
supposed
to
pay
us
but
did
not.
i
think
that
that's...
that's
what
judge
rymer
viewed
it
as,
but
under
that
view,
we
would
be
entitled
to
be
made
whole
irrespective
of
the
fund.
all
we're
seeking...
and
this
what
distinguishes
this
from
a
contract
case...
is
we're
seeking
if
there
is
money
in
the
fund,
that
we're
entitled
to
that.
mr.
thomas
f.
spaulding
pearlman,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
f.
spaulding
the
pearlman
doctrine
allows
the
sureties
to
recover
these
monies.
it's...
the
whole...
that
whole
concept
is
structured
on
the...
on
the
notion--
mr.
thomas
f.
spaulding
--and
i
think
that's
a
different
question,
your
honor,
but...
but...
but
the
notion
of...
which
is
squarely
within
the
holding
of
pearlman,
that
the
subcontractors
have
equitable
rights
which
arise
under
federal
common
law,
and
the
surety
steps
into
those
rights
by
paying
the
subcontractor--
mr.
thomas
f.
spaulding
--your
honor,
the...
justice
black's,
you
know,
words
were
that,
you
know,
we're
not
going
to
set
aside
these
principles
that
are...
are
so
embedded
in
our
commercial
practices,
our
economy,
this
court's
decisions.
they
cited
henningsen,
prairie
state
bank,
and
then
they
cited
19th
century
decisions
of
this
court
dealing
with
subrogation
in
order
to
do
that.
but--
mr.
thomas
f.
spaulding
--that's
correct.
and...
and
i
would
agree
with
what
mr.
lamken
said,
that
we're
not
relying
on
702
itself
to
give
us
the
rights.
mr.
thomas
f.
spaulding
your
honor,
they...
they
form
the
source
of
our
rights.
i
think
there's
really
two
components
of
what
we're
talking
here:
and
what
are
we
suing
for;
what
is
our
right?
and
we
look
at
pearlman
because
it
says
that
there
is
this
right
that
the
subcontractor
has.
and
the
court
of
claims
in
all
the
other
cases
have
discussed
this
in
the
past--
mr.
thomas
f.
spaulding
--no,
you're
not.
of
course
not,
your
honor.
but
what
i'm
saying
is...
is
that
this
right
is
there.
it
belongs
to
the
subcontractor
and...
and
i
think
that's
a
given
so
long
as
one
accepts
the
pearlman
doctrine.
mr.
thomas
f.
spaulding
that...
that's
correct,
your
honor.
and
then
we
go
over
to
the
bowen
situation
and
i
think
it's...
it's
quite
clear
in
this
situation
that
we're
not
dealing
with
money
damages.
and
we
talked
in
our
brief
at
some
length
about
the
origins
of
equitable
liens
and
how
they're
distinct
from
a
compensatory
device,
and
the
government
doesn't
disagree
with
that.
i
mean,
they
put
all
of
their...
of
their
eggs
in
the
appropriations
clause
basket
as
far
as
that,
but
they
don't
really
seem
to
continue
to
argue
that
an
equitable
lien
is
money
damages.
mr.
thomas
f.
spaulding
no,
you
could
not,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
f.
spaulding
a
materialman's
lien
would
arise
under
state
law.
i
think
that
would
have
supremacy
clause
implications
and
it's...
and
certainly
goes
far
beyond
what
the
limited
circumstance
of
this
case--
mr.
thomas
f.
spaulding
--that's
true,
your
honor,
and...
and
that
wasn't
done.
the
miller
act
certainly
was...
was
passed
against
a
backdrop
of
immunity.
but
this
is
a
very
narrow
case.
a
situation
like
this
only
comes
up
when
there
is
no
miller
act
bond,
and
so
it's...
it's
really
a
very
narrow
situation.
it's
not
at
all
going
to
take
the...
take
the
place
of
the
miller
act
remedy,
and...
and
it's...
it's
quite
a
narrow
situation.
mr.
thomas
f.
spaulding
no,
your
honor.
it's
what
we
were
discussing.
mr.
thomas
f.
spaulding
it's
the
pearlman
right
of
unpaid
laborers
and
materialmen
to
be
paid
out
of
the
remaining
fund.
mr.
thomas
f.
spaulding
yes,
that
has
its...
its
origin
in
this
court's
earlier
cases
which
we
were
discussing
earlier.
that
is
the
source
of
our
rights,
and
that
these
rights
have
been
recognized
for
decades,
albeit
unenforceable
by
a
subcontractor
itself.
now,
generally
most--
mr.
thomas
f.
spaulding
--well--
mr.
thomas
f.
spaulding
--no,
i
don't
think
there's
a
federal
materialman's
lien
itself,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
f.
spaulding
this
is
limited
to
the
situation
where
we're
talking
about
the
unpaid
laborers
and
materialmen
as
in
pearlman,
your
honor.
you
know,
beyond
that,
conceptually
speaking,
someone
could
say
that...
that,
well,
anybody
down
the
chain
might
have
some
kind
of
a
claim,
but
the
origins
of
this
in
this
court's
opinions
are
based
upon
people
who
contribute
to
federal
construction
projects.
and
that
was
the
situation
in
prairie
state
bank
and
henningsen
and
so
forth.
the
pearlman
doctrine
itself
is...
has
got...
has
got
to
the
point
of
being
a
bedrock
principle,
and
millions
of
dollars
a
year
are
disbursed
based
upon
the
settled
set
of
rules
we
have
as
the
result
of
pearlman.
mr.
thomas
f.
spaulding
your
honor,
we
would
love
to
go
to
the
court
of
claims
if
we
could.
i
mean,
that's...
there's
no
question
that
we
can't.
the
court
of
claims
has
said
we
don't
have
standing,
and
that's...
to
bring
a
contract
kind
of...
contract-based
claim
for
the
money.
mr.
thomas
f.
spaulding
no.
and
pearlman
itself
makes
clear
in
a
footnote
that
the...
this
right
arises
by
operation
of
law.
it
does
not
arise
out
of
a
contract.
so--
mr.
thomas
f.
spaulding
--it
arises
out
of
the
subrogation
laws
we
were
talking
about
earlier,
your
honor,
is
that,
you
know,
when
a
surety
pays
off
the
debt
of
someone
else--
mr.
thomas
f.
spaulding
--well,
i
think
it's...
it's
the
suretyship
law
or
the
law
of
subrogation,
your
honor,
that
it...
and
pearlman
cites
the
19th
century
cases
of
this
court
as
support
of
that,
that
in
order
to
prevent
unjust
enrichment,
it's
only
fair
that
when
a
surety--
mr.
thomas
f.
spaulding
--i
would
disagree
with
that
characterization,
your
honor.
one...
one
could
assert
a
contract-based
claim
because
certainly
we
have
a
loss
and
we
would
want
to
be
compensated
for
that
loss,
but
that's
not
our
claim.
that
misreads
our
claim.
what
we're
asking
for
is
to
be
paid
out
from
the
remaining
fund
if
any.
now,
if
we
were
asking
to
be
compensated
for
the
loss
we
suffered
because
verdan
didn't
pay
us,
conceivably
we
would
be
entitled
to
our
full
loss,
irrespective
of
the
content
of
the
fund.
and
that's
what
distinguishes
this...
this
claim
from
a
breach
of
contract
case.
one
doesn't
necessarily
have
to...
to
even
use
the
same
amount.
i
mean,
we're
not
relying
on
the...
on
the
verdan
contract
in
order
to
quantify
it.
we're
saying
that
prevent
unjust
enrichment,
we
should
be
entitled
to
that
money.
my
client
used
its
labor,
its
resources,
borrowed
money
to
build
this
building.
the
government
uses
it
every
day.
mr.
thomas
f.
spaulding
well,
your
honor...
and
i
would
suggest
that
that's
what
congress
was
reacting
to
when
it
passed
the
1976
amendment
to
section
702,
is
that
there
was
this
outcry
that
this
just
isn't
fair,
that
otherwise
meritorious
suits
are
being
thrown
out
of
court--
mr.
thomas
f.
spaulding
--your
honor,
a
right
isn't
based
upon
702,
but
the
waiver
of
immunity
is.
and...
and
what
they
said
in
702
is,
is
that
we
can
come
into
court
and
that
immunity
is
not
a
barrier
in
order
to
proceed.
but
we
have
these
rights
otherwise,
and
for
decades
they've
been
tried...
subcontractors
have
tried
to
enforce
them
and
couldn't
because
of
the
bar
of
sovereign
immunity.
and
that's
why
these
postal
service
cases
are
important
where
three
circuits,
in
a
case
of...
of
the
post
office
where
there's
a
clear
waiver
of
immunity
in
the
postal
reform
act,
have
said
that
the
subcontractor
lien
cases,
based
upon
pearlman
rights,
can
go
forward
where
immunity
is
waived.
and
the
source
of
those
is...
is
what
we
were
talking
about
earlier
under
pearlman--
mr.
thomas
f.
spaulding
--and,
your
honor,
section
702
is
a
statute
which
waives
immunity.
it's
a
broad
waiver
of
immunity.
what
this
court
said
is
an
important
part
of
a...
of
a...
of
a
special
piece
of
legislation
which
waives
immunity
in
all
cases--
mr.
thomas
f.
spaulding
--well,
that
was
the
whole
point
in
bowen,
your
honor,
is
that...
is
that
the
court
said
that
congress
used
the
more
limiting
words,
money
damages,
as
opposed
to
monetary
relief
in
702.
mr.
thomas
f.
spaulding
i...
i
would
disagree,
your
honor.
i
think
what
congress
was
looking
at
is
a...
especially
if
you
look
at
the--
mr.
thomas
f.
spaulding
--what...
what
they
talk
about,
your
honor,
is
the
1970
hearing,
which
is
quite
extensive,
and
they
were
talking
about
all...
all
the
cases
of...
of
sovereign
immunity
where,
in
particular,
cases
would
be
thrown
out
if
they
would
expend
themselves
on
the
public
treasury
or
somehow
result
in
the
disposition
of
unquestionably
sovereign
property.
and
there's
a
lot
of
discussion
there
about
the...
the
two
major
waivers
for
money
damages,
the
tort
claims
and
the
tucker
act.
and...
and
i
think
one
could
look
at
those...
look
at
the
legislative
history
and
say
what...
what
congress
had
in
mind
was
simply
we're
not
going
to
tread
upon
either
of
those.
so,
i
mean,
nothing
here
is
going
to
give
something
that
the
tort
claims
act
forbids,
for
example,
misrepresentation
claims,
or
nothing
gives
what...
what
the
court
of
claims
could
give
under
the
tucker
act,
for
example.
but
by
using
the
term
money
damages
rather
than
monetary
relief,
congress
made
very
clear
that
there
can
be
kinds
of
what
judge
bork
called
in
the
maryland
case
specific
monetary
relief,
which
is
transfers
of
money
from
one
side
to
the
other
without...
just
transfers
of
the
money
without
being...
without
it
being
money
damages.
mr.
thomas
f.
spaulding
well,
your
honor,
in
bowen
this
court
defined
damages.
mr.
thomas
f.
spaulding
i...
i
know,
but
your
honor,
it's
interesting
because
even
in
the
view
of
the
dissenting
judges
in
bowen
and
justice
white's
separate
opinion,
everybody
agreed
that
the
court
would
have
jurisdiction
as
to
prospective
economic
relief.
all
nine
of
the
justices
involved
were
in
agreement
as
to
that
point.
so...
so,
as
to
the
point...
specific
point,
here,
if
we
go
back
to
when
my
client
wrote
the
letter
as
to
a
request
to
enjoin
enforcement
or
dissipation
of
those
monies,
i
think
even
under
the
dissenting
opinion
in
bowen,
we
wouldn't
have
that
problem
because
we're
talking
about
prospective
monetary
relief,
and
that's
not
damages
under
any
of
the
justice's
versions
of...
in
bowen.
mr.
thomas
f.
spaulding
well,
i...
i
think
that's
the
point
justice
scalia
made
in
his
dissent,
that
carried
to
its
logical
conclusion
the
claims
court
would
be--
mr.
thomas
f.
spaulding
--well,
we're
not...
we
don't
have
a
claim
that
could
be
brought
into
the...
in
the
court
of
federal
claims.
mr.
thomas
f.
spaulding
this
is
an--
mr.
thomas
f.
spaulding
--that's
correct.
mr.
thomas
f.
spaulding
your
honor,
i
think
what
the
court
should
do
if
they
agree
with
me
is
limit
this
to
cases
arising
through
operation
of
law,
which
is
a...
a
right
arising
out
of
federal
common
law,
which
is
a
very,
very
narrow
kind
of
case.
all
those
other
cases--
mr.
thomas
f.
spaulding
--yes,
restitution,
specific
relief
in
restitution.
so,
we
wouldn't
get...
any
other...
any
other
case
where
somebody
is
evading
the...
the
claims
court
avenue
by
going
into
federal
district
court.
and
as
i
said,
we
would
love
to
be
in
claims
court
if
we
could,
but
unfortunately,
as...
as
the
dissenting
judge
said,
the
hapless
subcontractor
ends
up
holding
the
bag.
i
mean,
obviously
that's
not
fair.
but
the
question
here
is
that
we're
just
asking
for
our
day
in
court.
and...
and
what
the
government
is
saying
is
that...
is
that
even...
even
freezing
this
as
of
june
15th,
we're
still
dealing
with
money
damages.
and...
and...
as
i
mentioned
it,
under
all
nine
justices'
views
in
bowen,
a
claim
for
prospective
monetary
relief
is
not
money
damages.
and...
and
that's
really
the
issue
here
on
the
jurisdictional
like
he...
mr.
lamken
talked
about,
well,
you
know,
maybe
the
fund
has
been
dissipated
as
a
matter
of...
of
substantive...
of
lien
law,
i'm
going
to
lose,
but
that
goes
to
the
merits.
i
mean,
we
can
get
into,
you
know,
whether
the
money
is
still
there.
perhaps...
perhaps
these...
some
of
these
payments
to
verdan
were
unauthorized.
i
mean,
verdan
has
to
submit
certifications
with
its
request
for
progress
payment
saying
that
we're
going
to
pay
the
subcontractor.
perhaps
there's...
there's
a--
mr.
thomas
f.
spaulding
--thank
you,
your
honor.
