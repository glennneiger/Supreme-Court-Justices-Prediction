unknown
speaker
but
we've
also
said
that
it
can
be...
it
can
indirectly
be
a
recipient.
unknown
speaker
does
paralyzed
veterans
modify
the
regulation
that's
involved
in
this
case,
34
c.f.r....
what
106.h?
unknown
speaker
well,
it
said
directly
or
through
another
recipient.
unknown
speaker
how
do
you
smuggle
in
intended
recipient?
i
mean,
sometimes
you
say
recipient,
and
then...
and
then
you
say
intended
recipient.
do
our
opinions
say
intended
recipient?
unknown
speaker
well,
if
we
didn't
have
paralyzed
veterans
or
grove...
the
grove
case,
would
you
read
the
regulation
naturally
your
way
so
that
there
has
to
be
an
intent?
unknown
speaker
i
don't
see
where
you
get
that
from
the
face
of
the
regulation
if
we
talk
just
about
that.
i
recognize
you
have
the
gloss
of
the
case.
unknown
speaker
i
don't
understand
that.
you're...
you're
not
a
recipient
unless
you're
an
intended
recipient.
a
direct
recipient
is
a
recipient,
but
an
indirect
recipient
is
not
a
recipient
unless
he's
an
intended
recipient.
unknown
speaker
does
the
word
recipient
has...
have
some...
some
connotation
of
intent
in
it?
unknown
speaker
suppose
i'm
giving...
i'm
given
money.
i'm
given
food
stamps.
and
i
can
spend
them
anywhere
i
want
and
i
spend
them
at
a
particular
grocery
store.
wouldn't
it
be
proper
english
to
say
the
grocery
store
was
an
indirect
recipient
of
the...
of
the
food
stamps?
unknown
speaker
well,
was
there
a
contract
in
grove
city?
unknown
speaker
with
the
institution?
unknown
speaker
i
thought
it
was
simply
the...
i
thought...
i
guess
i
stand
corrected.
i
thought
grove
city
rested
on
the
fact
that
the
government
intended
the
institution
to
get
the
money,
and
it
was,
in
effect,
the...
the
specific
intent
to
have
the
money
end
up
with
x
that
made
x
liable--
unknown
speaker
--it's
basically
the
intent
in
appropriating
the
money
that's
the
criterion.
unknown
speaker
mr.
roberts,
what
there
is
is
a
significant
difference
between
the
relationship
of
the
airport
in
paralyzed
veterans.
the
airport
was
not
made
up
of
the
recipients
in
the
way
that
the
ncaa's
membership
is
largely
recipients.
so,
whatever
paralyzed
veterans
said,
it
didn't
have
that
picture
in
view,
that
is,
an
entity
composed
largely
of
constituents
that
are...
are
subject
to
title
ix
as
direct
recipients.
unknown
speaker
suppose...
suppose
you
had
a
federal
program
that
grants
monies
to
colleges
and
for...
for
a
specific
program,
the
study
of
science
in
a
particular
area.
and
a
hundred
percent
of
the
colleges
that
receive
the
money
put
a
hundred
percent
of
the
money
into
an
association
that's
somewhat
like
the
ncaa.
would
that
association
be
covered?
unknown
speaker
mr.
roberts,
there
is
some
argument
on
the
other
side
that,
well,
all
this
doesn't
matter
anyway
because
the
ncaa
gets
money
from
the
national
youth
sports
program
fund
as
a
direct
recipient.
now,
do
we
deal
with
that
question
here
or
what?
unknown
speaker
and
is
that...
is
that
a
federally
constituted
fund?
unknown
speaker
what
do
you
mean
it
wasn't
raised?
was
evidence
concerning
it--
unknown
speaker
--in
the
record?
unknown
speaker
the
evidence
was
also
that
it
was
once
the
ncaa
directly
and
then
it
was
set
up
as
a
separate
fund,
but
when
the
program
was
new,
the
money
went
directly
to
the
ncaa,
didn't
it?
unknown
speaker
was
there
evidence
that
this
organization
does
receive
federal...
federal
funding?
unknown
speaker
i
know
it
does.
was
there
evidence...
i'm
trying
to
see
whether--
unknown
speaker
--there
was
evidence
in
the
record.
unknown
speaker
anyway,
that
was
not
explored
below.
unknown
speaker
well,
there's
a...
more
of
a
question
of
the
separateness
of
the
two
when
it's
just
the
ncaa
and
the
nysp
than
when
you
have--
unknown
speaker
--hundreds
of
colleges
and
universities.
unknown
speaker
and
the...
and
the
court
below
didn't
test
either
the
theory
that
there
was
a
joint
venture
among
the
colleges
and
universities
to...
to
confer
on
the
ncaa
the
authority
for
operating
the
schools'
intercollegiate
programs.
unknown
speaker
mr.
roberts,
there's
one
aspect
of
this
case.
is
the
ncaa
a
501(c)(3)
organization?
unknown
speaker
well,
my
question
is...
is
whether,
independent
of
title
ix...
under
the
fifth
and
fourteenth
amendment
and
the
bob
jones
decision,
isn't
the
ncaa
under
an
obligation
not
to
discriminate
in
order
to
retain
its
tax
exempt
status?
unknown
speaker
but
here
it
was
just
title...
that
title
ix
was
the
only--
unknown
speaker
--and
the
allegation
is
that
somehow
the
waivers
were
granted
on
a...
on
the
basis
of
gender
discrimination?
unknown
speaker
is
that...
is
that
the
nub
of
the
allegation?
unknown
speaker
i
can
understand--
--your
view
is
that--
--excuse
me.
i
can
understand
that
position
on
the
merits
if
it's
a
rule
that's
being
challenged,
but
here
it's
the
enforcement
of
a
rule
of
discriminatory
policy
in
granting
or
refusing
waivers.
what
can
a
school
do
about
it
in
order
to
avoid
a
charge
of
discrimination?
unknown
speaker
well,
except
there
was
a
rule
that
on
its
face
said
only
women...
only
men
can
play
volleyball
or
something
like
that.
the
rule
would
clearly
know
it
should
not
follow
such...
the
school
would
clearly
know
it
should
not
follow
that
rule.
but
if
the
rule
is
facially
neutral
and
the
claim
is
that
somebody
over
whom
the
school
has
no
control
is...
is
operating
in
a
discriminatory
way,
what
is
the
school
supposed
to
do?
unknown
speaker
was
that
theory
the
one
relied
on
by
the
third
circuit?
unknown
speaker
to
specify
the
case
i'm
thinking
of,
imagine
a
university
that
has
lots
of
different
rules,
teaching
rules,
tenure
rules,
curriculum
rules,
dozens
of
them,
many
of
which
they
think
are
important.
five
universities
have
such
rules.
the
five
get
together
and
they
say,
well,
what
we'll
do
is
have
a
modern
languages
association
and
they
will
be
the
enforcer
of
the
rules
and
the
creator.
now,
your
view
is
that
even
though
the
modern
language
association,
say,
is
doing
just
what
the
universities
used
to
do,
it
can't
be
sued.
unknown
speaker
but...
but
how...
but
there
is
a
remedy
nonetheless.
you
sue
the
university.
unknown
speaker
and
in
any
case
in
which
you
could
have
sued
the
university,
had
the
modern
languages
association
not
been
in
existence,
but
the
university
would
have
done
that,
you
still
can
sue
them.
and
you
just
order
them
to
make
certain
that...
not
follow
the...
the...
the
association
rule.
is
that
the
idea?
unknown
speaker
all
right.
so,
it's...
that
means
it's
not
a
defense.
that
means
you
have
to
pretend
that
it's
the
school's
rule,
and
the
fact
that
it's
very
tough
for
the
school
to
get
everybody
together
and
make
these
changes,
et
cetera,
is
totally
beside
the
point.
is
that
your
view?
unknown
speaker
and
then
policing
them.
unknown
speaker
i
don't
quite
see
how
the
university
gets...
gets
stuck
here.
as
far
as
the
university
is
concerned,
it
pursuant
to
the
rules
has
denied
a
waiver
in
circumstances
where
denial
would
be
perfectly
appropriate.
as
far
as
what
the
university
has
done,
the
university
hasn't
discriminated
at
all.
unknown
speaker
the
only
thing
that
makes
the
waiver...
the
denial
of
the
waiver
bad
is
that
this
other
organization
has
granted
waivers
in
other
universities
in
other
contexts.
how...
how
do
you
pin
this
on
the...
on
the
university?
unknown
speaker
but
it
hasn't
done
anything
except
deny
a
waiver
under
circumstances
that
are
totally
reasonable,
and
it...
it
hasn't
granted
any
waivers
to
any
of
its
students
under
any
of
its
programs.
it's
only
the
granting
of
waivers
by
the
ncaa
to
other
students
in
other
programs
that
makes
the
thing
look
discriminatory.
unknown
speaker
but
the
university
is
not
applying
the
rule
in
a
discriminatory
manner.
it's
the
non-recipient
that
is
applying
the
rule
in
a
discriminatory
manner.
unknown
speaker
but...
no.
i'm
sorry.
finish
the
sentence.
unknown
speaker
i
was
going
to
say,
isn't
the
theory,
though...
as
justice
scalia's
question
points
out,
the
theory
is
not
merely,
i
guess,
that
the
university
has...
has
sort
of
voluntarily
ceded
authority
to
administer
the
rule.
it
has
sort
of
ceded
authority
or,
rather,
it
in
effect
has
made
itself
part
of
a
larger
scheme,
and
if
it
has
voluntarily
made
itself
part
of
the
larger
scheme
that
discriminates,
you
tag
the
university
with
the
discrimination.
isn't...
isn't
that
the
theory?
unknown
speaker
right,
but
when...
when
it
does
that,
it's
doing
something
more
than
saying
we
will
cede
the
decision
to
apply
our
rules
to
this
other
body.
it
is
really
saying
we
are
joining
a...
that
body's
regime
of
law
in
place
of
our
rules.
that's
what
it's
really
doing.
unknown
speaker
it
does
so
because
it
can
always
defy
the
organization.
unknown
speaker
but
until
it
defies
it,
it
in
effect
is
placing
itself
in
a
different
regime.
unknown
speaker
it
sounds
like
it
would
produce
a
bigger
mess
for
these
organizations
than
if
you
sued
them
directly.
you'd
have
universities
all
over
the
place
just
not
carrying
out
the
rules
lest
they
be
sued.
unknown
speaker
are
we
supposed
to
reach
this
argument
in
your
view
in
this
case,
this...
this
issue
of
ceding
authority
and
that
they're
covered
because
it's
the
ceding
of
authority,
et
cetera?
unknown
speaker
no,
no,
no.
i
mean,
it's
a
defense
of
the
third
circuit's
decision.
unknown
speaker
mr.
roberts,
apart
from
that...
that
rather
glancing
statement
that...
that
you
quoted
from
the
third
circuit
opinion,
was
this
issue
really
explored
in
front
of
the
third
circuit?
unknown
speaker
mr.
roberts,
what
do
you
think
we
should
do
with
the
case
if
we
agree
with
you
that
the
third
circuit
reasoning
was
wrong,
but
we're
not
sure
about
whether
they
should
have
been
allowed
to
file
an
amended
complaint?
unknown
speaker
did
you
argue
before
the
third
circuit
that
the
amendment
to
the
pleading
was
inadequate?
unknown
speaker
thank
you,
mr.
roberts.
mr.
phillips,
we'll
hear
from
you.
unknown
speaker
was
the
pro
se
litigant
a
lawyer?
unknown
speaker
she'd
been
to
law
school?
unknown
speaker
did
the
court
of
appeals
consider
it?
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
our
practice
is
that
we...
we
simply
don't
deal
with
issues
that
haven't
been
dealt
with
by
the
court
of
appeals,
as
you
know
from
recent
experience.
unknown
speaker
is
it
clear--
unknown
speaker
--is
it
clear
or
is
it
sort
of
unclear
from
the
record
whether
the
theory
of
coverage
under
the
proposed
amendment
of
the
complaint
is
sort
of
a
veil-piercing
theory
that
a
subsidiary
should
be
treated
like
the
parent,
or
on
the
other
hand,
that
it's
a
theory
similar
to
the
one
of
the
third
circuit
here
that
they
manage
the
program...
or
they
control
the
program--
unknown
speaker
--it
is
not.
unknown
speaker
both.
unknown
speaker
it
isn't
just
a
question
of
whether...
whether
the
rationale
is
available.
it's
a
question
of
whether
she
had
any
factual
allegations
that
would
support
all
of
the
rationales.
what...
what
factual
allegations
were
there?
or...
or...
or
is
the...
is
the
pro
se
litigant
to
be
excused
from
the
necessity
of
supporting
the
allegations
with
some
factual
allegations?
unknown
speaker
that's
a
conclusion.
that's
conclusory.
that's
no
facts
at
all
that
would
support
any
theory
that...
that
you're
asserting
here.
unknown
speaker
you
can
make
as
many
claims
as
you'd
like,
but
when
there's
a
motion
to
dismiss,
it
seems
to
me
you
have
to
come
up
with
factual
allegations
that
will
support
the
theory
that's...
that's
in
your
complaint--
unknown
speaker
--and
not
just
a
conclusory
statement
that,
for
whatever
of
various
reasons,
this
entity
is
a
recipient.
unknown
speaker
well,
it...
do
we
do
that
when
there's
been
a
motion
for
summary
judgment
and
the
motion
has
been
granted?
do
we
say,
well,
they
didn't
come
forward
with
the
facts,
but
we
all
know
that
the
facts
are
there,
so
we'll
send
it
back
and
let
them
come
forward
with
the
facts?
unknown
speaker
how
many
swings
do
you
get
at
this
thing?
unknown
speaker
was
it...
was
it
a
12(b)(6)
or...
did
the
district
court
go
on
12(b)(6)
or
56?
was
it
summary
judgment?
unknown
speaker
all
right.
so,
there
is
no
motion
for
summary
judgment,
so
she
needn't
have
come
forth.
unknown
speaker
there
is
no
need
to
come--
unknown
speaker
--well,
it's
not
really
quite
that
easy.
i
sympathize
with
your
position,
but
if
we
should
conclude...
i'm
not
saying
we
would...
that
the
reason
that
they
gave
for
sending
it
back
is
erroneous,
then
we're
asked
is
there
another
reason
which
would
justify
the
same
judgment,
that
it
was
not
an...
that
it
was
an
abuse
of
discretion
to
deny
leave
to
amend.
then
the
question,
it
seems
to
me,
arises
is
that
decision
to
be
made
on
the
basis
of
what
she
alleged
in
her
amended
pleading
or
can
she
also
rely
on
an
affidavit
that's
filed
later
before
the
court
of
appeals
that
the
district
court
never
had
a
chance
to--
unknown
speaker
--oh,
was
it?
oh,
i
misunderstood.
okay.
unknown
speaker
if...
if
it's
a
motion
to
dismiss,
why
was
there
an
affidavit
in
there
anyway?
you
think
of
that
as
appearing
at
the
summary
judgment
stage
rather
than
on
a
motion
to
dismiss.
unknown
speaker
the
affidavit
was
filed
by
the
defendant.
unknown
speaker
well,
it
says
under
any...
any
education
program
or
activity
receiving
federal
financial
assistance.
unknown
speaker
and
the
argument
is
that
ncaa
doesn't
receive
federal
financial
assistance.
unknown
speaker
and
they
certainly
don't
directly.
unknown
speaker
they
don't.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
mean
by
virtue
of
the
membership
dues--
unknown
speaker
--so,
if
i'm
a
parent
and...
and
i
don't
want
my
daughter
to
participate
in...
in
gym...
i
for
some
reason
don't
think
girls
should
play
athletics.
that's
my...
my
parental
view.
i'm
guilty
of
violating
this
provision
if
i...
if
i
stop
the...
the
child
from
going
to
gym
in
school.
right?
unknown
speaker
why
not?
unknown
speaker
you're
talking
about
a
program.
a
person
has
been
discriminated
against
under
the
program,
prevented
from
participating
in...
in
one
of
the
school
functions.
unknown
speaker
so,
you're
limiting
your
principle
then.
you're...
you're
no
longer
relying
on
the
plain
language
of
the
statute.
you're
saying
there
have
to
be
some
conditions
made
to--
unknown
speaker
--only
parents.
only
parents.
it
permits
them
to
limit
it.
what
about
a
schoolyard
bully?
unknown
speaker
what
about
a
schoolyard
bully
who
prevents
the
program
from
really
operating?
unknown
speaker
under
the
blackstone
theory
that
you...
that
you
cite,
i...
i
take
it
other
students
could
sue
the
bully.
unknown
speaker
well--
unknown
speaker
--our
decision
in
paralyzed
veterans
construed
the
statutory
language,
and
you
know,
perhaps
a
broader
construction
might
have
been
permissible,
but
it
put
a
definitive
construction
on
the
language.
unknown
speaker
mr.
phillips,
i
understand
your
plain-language
argument,
and
i
think
it's
quite
persuasive.
but...
but
this...
this
problem
concerns
me.
under
your
construction
of
the
statute,
if
i
understand
it
correctly,
the
scope
of
the
private
remedy
is
broader
than
the
scope
of
the
remedy
available
to
the
united
states.
unknown
speaker
but
within
this
very
case.
unknown
speaker
because
they
can't
cut
off
funds
to
the
ncaa
if
the
ncaa
doesn't
get
any
funds.
unknown
speaker
but
it
does
seem
anomalous
to
say
that
a...
a...
an
implicit
remedy,
a
private
cause
of
action,
is
broader
than
the...
than
the
statutory
express
remedy.
unknown
speaker
could
i
ask
before
you
get
to
one
other
rationale?
unknown
speaker
as
i
understand
it,
this...
this
means
that...
that
even
though
the
implementing
agency
issues
regulations
which
the
university
complies
with,
the
university
may,
nonetheless,
be
liable
to
private
suits
because
private
individuals
are
not
governed
by
these
regulations.
unknown
speaker
oh,
i
can
imagine
lots
of
situations.
unknown
speaker
in
the...
in
the
earlier
situation
where...
where
the
agency
was
not
taking
the
position
that
the
ncaa
was
covered
but
was
taking
the
opposite
position,
that
would
have
been
exactly
that
case.
despite
the
fact
that
the
agency
takes
one
position,
a
private
individual
gets
the
law
interpreted
by
a
court
in
a...
in
a...
in
a
different
fashion
insofar
as
it
applies
to
private
individuals.
unknown
speaker
i
missed
your...
i
missed--
unknown
speaker
--i
missed
your
basic
distinction.
you
were
saying
that
people
can
be
liable
under
the
act
who
don't
receive
federal
funds
if
those
people
themselves
deprive
a
person
of
a
right
to
participate
in
a
program
by
an
institution
that
does.
unknown
speaker
all
right.
now,
what
circumstances?
you
seem
to
me
to
be
saying
that
it
was
not
the
case
that
an
individual
could,
that
it
was
the
case
an
entity
could.
unknown
speaker
well,
if
that's
so,
it...
i
mean,
that
doesn't
seem...
i
can't
figure
that
one
out.
i
mean,
a
thief
who
stole
books
from
the
women's
dormitory
couldn't
because
it's
a
thief,
but
the
electricity
company
that
cut
off
the
electricity
to
the
women's
dormitory
so
they
couldn't
participate
would?
i
mean,
there
must
be
some
limiting
principle
in
that.
unknown
speaker
it
can't
be
that
one.
unknown
speaker
that's
what...
it's
a
kind
of
control
theory.
it's
a
kind
of--
unknown
speaker
--it's
a
kind
of
delegation
of
control
theory.
unknown
speaker
and
is
that...
to
what
extent
was
that
delegation
of
control
theory,
which
is
i
think
a
very
interesting
theory...
to
what
extent
has
that
been
explored
below
or
in
other
courts?
unknown
speaker
mr.
phillips,
as
far
as
organizations
are
concerned
and
the
conceding
control
for
the
operation,
the
petitioner's
brief
included
an...
an
appendix
with
lots
of
academic
type
organizations.
and
what
is
your
counsel
with
respect
to
that
list?
are
they
all
like
the
naac...
ncaa?
are
some
of
them
like
it?
how
many
of
those
dozens
of
organizations
would
be
covered?
unknown
speaker
but
on
the
third
circuit's
theory,
they're...
they're
all
covered
now
because
they
all...
all
get
dues
from
recipients.
unknown
speaker
i
had
one
question
about
bringing
in
the
schools
themselves.
there's
no
limitation
problem
because
they
were...
that
was
proposed
at
an
earlier
stage
at
the
time--
unknown
speaker
--thank
you,
mr.
phillips.
mr.
kneedler,
we'll
hear
from
you.
unknown
speaker
but,
mr.
kneedler,
it
is
true,
isn't
it,
i
think
that
the
briefs
have
adequately
argued
out
the
question
whether
the
nc...
the
association's
control
over
the
program
is
sufficient
to
subject
it
to
liability.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
understand
we
don't
have
to.
unknown
speaker
but
don't
you
think
we
should?
unknown
speaker
i
mean,
that's
really
the
issue
in
the
case
right
now.
unknown
speaker
do
we
have
record...
do
we
have
anything
in
the
record
that
would
answer
that
question?
for
example,
i...
maybe
i
wasn't
paying
attention
because
i
didn't
think
it
was
important
to
me,
but
do
i...
do
i
know
from
the
record...
should
i
know
from
the
record
exactly
what
would
happen
if
either
of
these
colleges
defy
the
ncaa?
can
i
tell
that
from
the
record?
unknown
speaker
then
i
guess--
unknown
speaker
--that
would
go
to
the
question
of
what...
what
degree
of
control
there
was.
unknown
speaker
well,
except...
may
i
just
ask
one?
sure.
except
we
have
a
regulation
in
front
of
us
under
which
presumably
there
shouldn't
be
any
discrimination,
but
the
claim
is
that
the
regulation
is
not
being
administered
according
to...
to
a...
by
a
neutral
application
of
its
terms.
and
i
suppose
there...
there
may,
indeed,
be
rules
governing
the
relationship
between
a
college
and
the...
the
ncaa
and
they
not
be
administered
according
to
their...
neutrally
according
to
their
terms.
and
so,
it
seems
to
me
that
it
would
be
wise
to...
to
have
an
opportunity
to
find
that
out
and
have
a
record
so
indicating...
indicating
that
opportunity
before
we
get
into
it.
unknown
speaker
before
you
do
that,
i
don't
agree
with
it,
and...
and
explain
to
me
how
knowing
the
facts
which
establish
the
ceding
of
control
will
help
us
decide
the
question
whether
the
ceding
of
control
violates
title
ix
or
not.
unknown
speaker
i
mean,
all
of
these
facts
to
go
to
whether
in
fact
control
has
been
ceded.
let's
stipulate
total
control
has
been
ceded.
unknown
speaker
what
it
means
is
that
total
control
has
been
ceded.
what...
what
could
it
mean
beyond
that?
unknown
speaker
i
really
don't
see
how
we...
how
we
need
more
facts
to
decide
that...
that
quite
clear
question
of
law.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
mean,
it
would
depend
on
whether
you
address
it
what
your
answer
is.
i
guess
in
those
circumstances,
no
matter
what
i
guess
you
could
address
it,
but
if
it's
a
more
complicated
question
than
that,
maybe
you
should
get
the
facts.
unknown
speaker
exactly.
they're
arguing
the
absolute
rule.
unknown
speaker
well,
but
that...
that
produces
difficulties
of
its
own,
mr.
kneedler,
since
this
is
a
spending
clause
program.
and
the
commitments
of
the
states
and
so
forth
are
supposed
to
be
clearly
spelled
out.
and
if
we
have
this
kind
of
amorphous
thing,
it
might
be,
but
it
might
not
be,
that
itself
tends
to
run
afoul
of
spending
clause
decisions.
unknown
speaker
it
seems
to
me,
mr.
kneedler,
no...
no
total
answer
to
the
point
the
chief
justice
was
making
to
the
point
that
the
rule
you
urge
will
create
confusion.
it
seems
to
me
no
answer
to
say,
well,
its
application
will
be
clear
in
the
present
case.
i
mean,
we're
adopting
a
rule
that
will
apply
to
hundreds
of
thousands
of
other
cases,
and
it
doesn't
give
me
great
comfort
to
know
that,
well,
it's
easy
to
say
how
it
applies
here.
unknown
speaker
but
if...
if
you're
right
that
that
would
impose
liability
on
the
superior
governing
authority,
would
the
school
itself
still
be
liable?
unknown
speaker
thank
you.
thank
you,
mr.
kneedler.
mr.
roberts,
you
have
3
minutes
remaining.
unknown
speaker
but,
mr.
roberts,
given
the
pro
se
litigant,
given
the
large
discretion
that
the
district
judge
has
on
complaint
amendments,
should
we
be
the
one
to
decide
whether
the
amendment
of
the
complaint
is
too
late
and
given
cases
like
conley
against
gibson
where
this
court
has
said...
instructed
lower
courts,
be
generous
to
pro
se
litigants
as
far
as
amendment
is
concerned?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
don't
know.
if
you
look
at
the
forms
at
the
end
of
the
federal
rules,
is
negligently
drove
a
fact?
is
money
having
received
a
fact?
i
mean,
those
forms
are
very
skimpy.
unknown
speaker
you
could
ask
for
a
more
definite
statement.
they...
they
alleged
ncaa
is
a
federal
fund
recipient.
okay.
usually
before
you
cut
off
a
plaintiff's
head,
you
give
them
a
chance
to
flesh
out
an
allegation.
unknown
speaker
mr.
roberts,
may
i
ask
you
what
your
view
is
on
the
question
whether
we
should
decide
the
delegation
of
a
control
over
a
program
issue?
unknown
speaker
my...
my...
the
question
is
whether
you
think
we
ought
to
decide
this
other
theory,
you
know--
unknown
speaker
--how
do
we
get
that
in
the
question?
the
question
says
because
it
receives
payments
from
entities
that
do
so.
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
receiving
payments.
control
or
not
control
or
delegation
would
be
identical
whether
they
happen
to
charge
dues
or
whether
they
don't
charge
dues.
unknown
speaker
that's
the
end
of
that.
you
have...
i'm--
--thank
you,
mr.
roberts.
