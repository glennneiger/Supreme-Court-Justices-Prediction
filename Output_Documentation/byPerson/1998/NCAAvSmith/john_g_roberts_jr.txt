chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
is
here
from
the
third
circuit
which
held
that
the
ncaa
would
be
covered
by
title
ix
if
it
received
dues
from
member
institutions
which
receive
federal
financial
assistance.
that
decision
is
wrong
and
should
be
reversed.
it's
wrong
because
court
has
held
that
for
an
entity
to
be
covered
by
title
ix,
or
any
of
the
other
statutes
with
the
same
federal
funding
trigger,
the
entity
must
itself
be
a
recipient
of
federal
financial
assistance.
the
court
said
just
that
in
the
paralyzed
veterans
case.
quote,
congress
limited
the
scope
of
the
law
to
those
who
actually
receive
federal
financial
assistance.
end
quote.
later
in
the
same
opinion,
the
court
said
that
these
laws,
quoting
again,
require
us
to
identify
the
recipient
of
the
federal
assistance.
and
it
also
explained
why
that
is
so.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
in
the
grove
city
case,
your
honor,
but
the
test
is
the
same.
whether
a
direct
recipient
or
an
indirect
recipient,
the
entity
must
be
the
intended
recipient
under
the
grant
statute
or
program.
and
the
reason
for
that
is
clear,
the
condition...
the
prohibition
on
discrimination
is
imposed
as
a
condition
on
the
receipt
of
funds.
so,
it
is
limited
to
those
who
accept
the
funds
and
thereby
agree
to
the
condition.
that
is
consistent
with
the
court's
decision
last
term
in
gebser
which
reaffirmed
that
construction
and
the
rationale.
the
discriminatory
acts
of
the
school
employee
in
that
case
did
not
automatically
trigger
a
damage
action
under
title
ix
because
title
ix's
coverage
is
limited
to
recipients.
the
recipient
was
the
school
district,
not
the
employee,
and
therefore
the
question
was
what
did
the
school
district
know
and
what
did
the
school
district
do
or
not
do.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
106.2(h).
i
think
it
can
be
read...
the
regulation
could
be
read...
consistent
with
paralyze
veterans.
as
even
the
solicitor
general
acknowledges,
all
of
the
regulations
impose
obligations
only
on
recipients.
and
the
regulation
doesn't
say,
as
the
third
circuit
thought,
that
it
was
enough
that
you
operate
an
educational
program
or
activity.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
directly
or
through,
a
reference
to
the
holding
in
grove
city
that
you
can
be
an
indirect
recipient.
but
the
test
is
still
the
same.
whether
indirect
or
direct,
are
you
the
intended
recipient?
what
the
court
said
in
paralyzed
veterans
is
to
find
the
recipient,
you
have
to
look
to
the--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--well,
grove
city
is
the
case
that
i'm...
i'm
thinking
of,
and
there
what
the
court...
the
checks
were
made
out
to
the
students.
but
the
statute
that
gave
the
money
said
this
is
to
provide
assistance
to
institutions
of
higher
education.
the
money
could
only
be
spent
on
tuition
at
those
institutions
of
higher
education.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
i
think--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--yes.
the
regulation
says
that
the
receipt
can
be
indirect,
but
it
is
still...
you
still
have
to
be
a
recipient.
and
it
is
not
enough
simply
to
trace
the
money.
and
because
you
are
paid
by
a
recipient
of
federal
funds,
that
doesn't
mean
that
you
are
also
a
recipient
of
federal
funds.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
what
the...
what
the
court--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--well,
you
have
to...
you'd
be
the
recipient
of
the
federal
grant.
what
the
court
said
in
paralyzed
veterans
in
the
easy
case,
if
the
grant
statute
extends
money,
quote,
then
the
recipient
is
the
entity
that
receives
the
money.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
the
key
is
whether
there
is
a
spending
clause
contract
between
the
recipient
and
the
federal
government
whereby
the
recipient
agrees
to
accept
the
conditions,
the
prohibitions
on
discrimination,
in
exchange
for
accepting
the
federal
funds.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
there
was,
yes.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
with
the
institution.
that's
what
the
case
was
about.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
the...
what
was
the
issue
in
the
case
was
whether
the
university
had
to
execute
the...
the
contract
that
the
government
gave
it.
that's
what...
what
the
litigation
was
over,
and
the
court
said
yes.
and
it
said
yes
because
in
deciding
who
the
recipient
is,
you
look
to
what
the
statute
says,
and
here
it
said
this
is
for
institutions
of
higher
education.
this
is
all
the
money
could
be
spent
on.
so,
the
fact--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--in
the
underlying
grant
statute,
as
the
court
said
in
paralyzed
veterans,
and
in
all
of
the
briefs
filed
on
the
respondent's
side
of
this
case,
you
will
not
find
analysis
of
an
underlying
grant
statute
that
says,
this
is
to
extend
financial
assistance
to
the
ncaa.
that's
the
key
element
that
is
called
for
by
this
court's
decision
and
it's
missing
from
all
the
arguments
on
the
other
side
because
there
is
no
grant
statute
that
extends
federal
financial
assistance
to
the
ncaa.
now,
the--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--the...
the
ncaa
is
an
association
of
its
members,
and
most
of
its
members,
as
your
honor
points
out,
do
receive
federal
financial
assistance.
but
the
association
does
not,
and
the...
the
colleges
as
a
collective
group,
with
respect
to
their
intercollegiate
athletic
activities,
does
not
receive
federal
financial
assistance.
the
individual
colleges
do
and
they
remain
responsible
and
covered
under
title
ix.
but
the
ncaa
does
not.
and
the
third
circuit's
reasoning
that
they're
somehow
covered
simply
because
the
members
pay
dues
presents
the
exact
problem
the
court
was
concerned
about
in
paralyzed
veterans,
that
if
you
depart
from
the
spending
clause
contract,
the
entity
that
has
accepted
the
condition
because
it
has
accepted
the
funds,
then
you...
once
you
sever
title
ix
from
those
moorings
in
the
spending
clause,
it
has
almost
limitless
coverage
because
you--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--no,
because
again
that's
the...
the
lesson
of
paralyzed
veterans.
you
don't
just
follow
the
money
or
follow
the
federal
financial
assistance
to
an
ultimate
beneficiary.
the
colleges
would
remain
liable
for
any
discriminatory
acts
of
theirs,
but
the
separate
entity
that
they
formed
would
only
be
covered
if
that
entity
accepted
federal
financial
assistance
and
thereby
accepted
the
spending
clause
condition
that
goes
along
with
the
assistance.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it
was--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--the
issue
of
the
national
youth
sports
program
was
not
addressed
either
by
the
district
court
or
by
the
third
circuit
below,
and
i
don't
think
that
this
court
should
address
it,
at
least
not
in
the...
in
the
first
instance.
it
wasn't...
presumably
wasn't
addressed
by
the
third
circuit
because
it
wasn't
raised
before
the
district
court.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
the
only
evidence--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--the
only
evidence
in
the
record
concerning
the
national
youth
sports
program
was
an
affidavit
filed
by
an
ncaa
officer
that
establishes
that
it's
a
separate
missouri
corporation.
it's
not
the
ncaa,
and
that
the
ncaa
receives
no
money
from
the
nysp.
that's
the
only
evidence
of
record
in
this
case
concerning
that...
that
fund.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
yes,
and
then...
then
a
separate
corporation
was
established
to
administer
the
grant,
not
the
ncaa,
which
makes
perfect
sense
because
what
the
national
youth
sports
program
does
is
not...
doesn't
concern
intercollegiate
athletics.
it's
not
something
that's
part
of...
central
to
the
ncaa's
mission.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
the
national
youth
sports
program
receives
federal
funding,
yes.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
yes.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
in...
yes,
i
believe
in
the
affidavit
they
explained
that
this
was
a
federal
funding
recipient.
but
it's
not
the
ncaa
and
the
ncaa
does
not
receive
any
of
the
money
from
the
national
youth
sports
program.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it
was
never
addressed
by
either
court
below,
and
the
fact
that
it
wasn't
has
led
to
some
confusion
as
to
exactly
what
the
claim
is.
it's
not
clear
whether
the
claim
is
sort
of
a
veil-piercing
claim
that
somehow
the
nysp
is
the
ncaa,
which
the
allegations
certainly
don't
support
because
that
issue
goes
to
observance
of
corporate
formalities
and
the
like,
and
there's
no
suggestion
that
that
hasn't
occurred.
or
is
the
allegation
simply
that
the
ncaa
is
an
indirect
recipient
through
the
nysp,
which
would
raise
the
same
issues
as
the
dues.
there's
no
suggestion
that
the
money
that's
extended
to
the
nysp
is
intended
to
be
received
or
extended
to
the
ncaa.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
those
claims--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--and
those...
as
i
say,
those
claims
have
never
been
tested
in
either
court
below
because
they
weren't
raised.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
the
third
circuit
referred
to
the
ncaa
as
something
of
a
surrogate
for
the
schools
in...
in
this
regard.
but
here
again...
and
the
government's
own
regulation
establishes
that...
it's
not
enough
that
you're
involved
somehow
in
operating
an
educational
program
or
activity.
countless
non-recipients
do
that
in
schools
across
the
country.
you
must
also
be...
and
the
regulation
says
this...
an
entity
to
whom
federal
financial
assistance
is
extended.
so,
the
fact
that
the
ncaa
may
play
some
role
in
intercollegiate
athletics
and
that
intercollegiate
athletics
may
be
a
program
or
activity
of
the
colleges
and
universities,
not
of
the
ncaa,
because
to
be
a
program
or
activity
under
the
statute,
you
must
receive
federal
financial
assistance--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--it
is
tax
exempt,
yes.
i'm
not
quite
sure
whether
it's--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--oh,
well,
first
of
all,
it's
important
to
appreciate
the
ncaa
firmly
endorses
and
embraces
the
principles
of
title
ix,
believes
it
does
not
violate
that
in
any
way,
and
conducts
its
activities
to
promote
gender
equity.
now,
the
position...
the
question
of
whether
the
tax
exempt
status
is...
is...
can
be
brought
into
question
because
of
its
activities
is...
is
a
separate
one
and
it's
distinct.
but
under
the
bob
jones
case,
yes,
that
to
the
extent
the...
the
organization,
any
tax
exempt
organization,
engages
in
these
sorts
of
discriminatory
activities,
that
can
be
called
into
question,
but--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--title
ix
was
the
only...
the
only
issue
that
the
third
circuit
addressed--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--well,
the--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--the
allegation
is
that
waivers
were
given
disproportionately
to
one
gender
as
opposed
to
another,
which
we
of
course
dispute
on
the
merits,
but
the
merits
are
not
before
the
court
because
the
ncaa
is
not
a
federal
funding
recipient.
this,
by
the
way,
used
to
be
the
position
of
the
government.
when
the
hew
issued
regulations
in
1975,
it
told
the
colleges
in
the
area
of
intercollegiate
athletics
that
you
have
the
obligation
not
to
discriminate,
and
they
issued
a
regulation
that
said,
and
you're
not...
that
obligation
isn't
obviated
or
alleviated
by
any
athletic
association
rule.
and
the
colleges
squawked
about
that
and
they
said,
well,
you
know,
what...
if
there's
an
association
rule
that
says
one
thing
and
title
ix
says
the
other,
that
doesn't
seem
right.
and
hew
stuck
to
its
guns
and
it
said,
look,
you
are
the
members
of
this
association.
if
they
have
a
rule
that
causes
you
problems
complying
with
title
ix,
change
the
rule.
and
then
when
the
ncaa
challenged
these
regulations,
the
agency
and
the
justice
department
alleged
that
we
had
no
standing
because
title
ix
did
not
apply
to
us,
the
regulations
didn't
apply
to
us,
because
they
didn't
apply,
as
their
brief
put
it,
to
a
private
athletic
association.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
first
of
all,
it
shouldn't
make
a
difference
what
the...
what
type
of
rule
it
is.
i
mean,
the
ncaa
is--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--well,
first
of
all,
whether
the
ncaa
is
covered
to
not
shouldn't
depend
on
what
type
of
rule
it
is.
but
in
that
situation,
it's
really
just
an
evidentiary
matter.
if
the
allegation
is
everybody
else
gets
waivers
from
this
rule,
that's
something
that
can
be
investigated
by
the
school.
it's
the
school's
responsibility
because
the
school
is
engaging
in
the...
in
the
activity
that's
covered
by
title
ix.
the
one
thing,
of
course,
that
hew
would
have
said
in
response
to
the
school's
objection
if
it
were
true
is,
well,
don't
worry.
the
association
is
covered
too
and
it
will
be...
and
it
will
be
sued.
it
did
not
say
that.
and
the
justice
department
and
the
agency
sued
because
we
were
not
covered
when
we
tried
to
challenge
the
regulations.
now,
20
years
later,
they
come
in
with
a
new
theory
that
says,
don't...
don't
look
at
recipient,
which
has
been
the
cornerstone
of
the
court's
title
ix
jurisprudence.
don't
look
at
who
the
recipient
is.
just
ask
yourself
whether
this
entity
has
ceded
authority
or
effective
control,
a
much
more
amorphous
inquiry
that
departs
from
the
bright
line
recipient
test
and
also
rips
title
ix--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--no,
i
don't
believe
so,
your
honor.
the
third
circuit
said
that
the
ncaa
was
covered
because
the
dues...
the
members
were
covered
and
they
paid
dues
and
it
sort
of
followed
the
money
chain
and
that
was
sufficient.
the
ceded
authority
or
effective
control
theory
is
a...
is
a
new
theory,
and
it's
one
that
shouldn't
be
adopted,
particularly
with
respect
to
a
threshold
determination
of
coverage.
that
should
be
a
bright
line
rule,
as
it
is
under
this
court's
decision,
are
you
a
recipient,
instead
of
an
amorphous,
multi-factored
test
that
would
ask
who's
in
control
and
who's
not
in
control.
and
that
test
also
does
not
limit
the
universe
of
those
covered
in
the
way
that
this
court
in
paralyzed
veterans
indicated
was
necessary
because
any
time
you
have
an
intercollegiate
athletic
event,
there
are
lots
of
different
entities
in
charge
of
different
aspects,
some
connected
with
the
college,
some
not
connected
with
the
college,
some
that
are
a
federal
funds
recipient,
and
some...
some
that
are
not:
the
entity
that...
that
might
rent
out
the
auditorium,
vendors
who
might
provide
services,
in
some
cases
other
organizations
that
are
setting
rules,
like
the
united
states
golf
association
would
be
setting
the
rules
for
a
golf
tournament.
all
of
those
entities
have
some
sort
of
authority
or
effective
control
over
the
activity,
but
that
shouldn't
make
them
covered
by
title
ix
when
they
are
not
recipients
of
the
federal
financial
assistance.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it
cannot
be
sued
unless--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--of
course.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
just...
just
what
hew
said
when
it
issued
its
regulations.
it's
no
defense
that
an
athletic
association,
or
in
your
case
the
modern
languages
association,
has
a
rule
and
you're
just
obeying
that
rule.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
whoever
is
implementing
the...
the
discrimination
and
is
the
recipient,
in
your
hypothetical
the
colleges
and
universities,
can
be
sued
for
that
discrimination.
the
entity
that
is
in
your
hypothetical
setting
the...
the
rules
unless--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--unless
it
is
itself
a
recipient
of
federal
financial
assistance,
it's
not
covered
by
title
ix.
now,
this
is...
it's
not--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--well,
if
the
university
is--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--because
the
university
is
the
entity
that
is
operating
the
covered
program
or
activity
and
the
fact
that
it
may
be...
is
complying
with
a
discriminatory
rule
is
no
defense
and
the
fact
that
it
is
complying
with...
and
applying
a
rule--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--well,
and
it's
just
an
evidentiary
question
to
know
that.
if
you
have
a
rule
that's
being
applied
in
a
discriminatory
manner,
you're
not
free
to
say,
well,
i'm
just
going
to
apply
the
rule
regardless
of
the
fact
that
others
are
not
applying
the
rule.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
by
not...
if
everyone
else
is
granting
waivers
and
this
is
something
the
university
knows,
its
decision
not
to
grant
a
waiver
would
be
applying
the
rule
in
a
discriminatory
manner.
it's...
it's
an
evidentiary
question
to
find
out
how
it's
been
applied
before.
the
fact
that
it
may
be--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--i
was
just
going
to
say
the
fact
that
it
may
be
easier
to
get
the
information
from
one
entity
as
opposed
to
another
doesn't
mean
that
title
ix
coverage
extends
to
an
entity
that
has
not
accepted
federal
funds.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
the
university
is
covered
by...
if
it
makes
a
decision
that
we're
going
to
apply
the
rules
of
the
xyz
organization
and
the
xyz
organization
is
known
to
always
apply
discriminatory
rules,
it
can't
insulate
itself
from
that.
it
is...
it
is
responsible
for
its
own
actions.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but...
but...
but
the
important
thing
is
that
the
university
retains
control
over
the
ultimate
decision.
this
court
addressed
that
in
the...
in
the
context
of
state
action
in
the
tarkanian
case.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
yes.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
yes,
and...
and
it's
no
defense
to
whatever
discrimination
is
alleged
to
say,
well,
we're
just
following
somebody
else's
rule.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
and
what
tends...
tends
to
happen
is
exactly
what
hew
said
should
happen
back
in
1975,
which
is
you
or
the...
you're
covered.
you're
the
members.
if
this
rule
is
causing
you
problems,
change
the
rule.
that's
what
tends
to
happen
as
a
matter
of
practice.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
i
don't
think
it's
necessary
to
reach
it
to
reverse
the
third
circuit's
decision
because
that
was
based
on
the
payment
of
dues.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but...
but
if
the
court
reaches
it,
it
seems
to
me
that
it
ought
to
be
clear
that
this
is
a
departure
from
what
has
been
the
unifying
thread
in
this
court's
title
ix
decisions,
which
is
that
coverage
is
limited
to
a
recipient,
not
to
someone
who
has
ceded
authority,
effective
control,
something
like
that,
but
the
recipient
itself.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no,
not
the
effective
control
or
ceded
authority.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
in
that
case,
your
honor,
i
think
the
decision...
judgment
should
be
reversed
and
the
case
should
be
remanded
for
further
proceedings,
including
to
allow
the
third
circuit
in
the
first
instance
to
decide
which
arguments
have
been
preserved,
which
arguments
have
been
waived.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
the
amendment
to
the
pleading
was...
was
really
beside
the
point
because
the
district
court,
at
page
31a
of
the
petition
appendix,
treated
the
claim
as
if
it
had
been
made,
that
the
ncaa
was
an
indirect
recipient.
it
posed
the
question
that
the
district
court
and
the
third
circuit
addressed
which
is
what's...
what
do
you
have
to
show
to
establish
that.
so,
that
it
seems
to
me
is
a...
is
a
red
herring
because
the
district
court
treated
her
original
complaint
as
if
it
had
alleged
the
ncaa
was
a
recipient
because
of
these
connections.
thank
you,
your
honor.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
your
honor.
first,
i'd
like
to
agree
with
both
of
my
brothers
that
the
third
circuit
decision
was
wrong.
it
was
wrong
because
title
ix,
as
spending
clause
legislation,
is
limited
to
recipients,
and
the
effort
to
rely
on
the
dues
or
some
surrogate
relationship
severs
title
ix
from
its
rooting
in
the
spending
clause
and
the
limitation
to
recipients.
the
argument
that
was
raised
that
the
statutory
language
doesn't
carry
any
such
limitation
was
the
precise
argument
that
was
raised
last
term
in
gebser,
and
it
was
rejected
in
gebser.
if
it's
enough
to
be
subject
to
discrimination
under
a
program,
the
student
in
gebser
certainly
was,
but
that
was
not
enough
because
title
ix
is
limited
to
recipients.
and
so,
the
question
is
what
does
a
recipient
know
about
what
was
going
on
and
what
did
the
recipient
do
or
not
do.
now,
so
far
as
the
new
alternative
arguments
are
made,
it
is
important
to
recognize
that...
that
in
our
view
they
have
not
been
properly
preserved.
the
nysp
argument,
for
example,
was
not
mentioned
before
the
district
court
by
the
plaintiff.
the
court
said,
assuming
your
complaint
is
amended--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--but
they
have
to
allege
facts.
the
way
it
works
is
you
allege
facts
and
then
you
test
those
against
the
legal
standard--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--and
what
happened
is
the
district
court
said
on
this
motion
to
dismiss,
we
have
to
test
and
see
what
the
standards
are
to
establish
that
someone
is
an
indirect
recipient.
what...
what
do
you
have
in
mind?
what
are
you
talking
about--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--well,
and
she
was
afforded
that
opportunity.
the
district
court
basically
said
what
is
it
that
you're
talking
about
when
you
say,
and
if
the
answer
is
dues,
which
is
what
the
answer
that
was
given,
then
that's
not
enough
and
the
complaint
should
be
dismissed.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
think
the
reason
the
third
circuit
is
wrong
is
because
the
ncaa
is
not
a
recipient.
that
is
an
argument
that
would
rely
on
extending
title
ix
to
non-recipients.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
think
the
court
should
decide
the
question
whether
having
so-called
effective
control
or
ceded
authority
is
enough
to
subject
you
to
coverage
under
title
ix
when
you're
not
a
recipient.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
because
the
reason
the
dues
are
not
sufficient
is
because
you
have
to
be
a
recipient
which
was
the
argument
we
raised,
and
their
answer
was,
no,
you
don't.
it's
enough--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--thank
you.
