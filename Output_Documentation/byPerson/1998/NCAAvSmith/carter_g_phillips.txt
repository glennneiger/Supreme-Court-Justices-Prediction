mr.
carter
g.
phillips
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
guess
i'd
like
to
start
essentially
where
mr.
roberts
ended
which
is
an
examination
of
what
is
at
a
minimum
the
appropriate
course
for
this
court
to
follow
with
respect
to
the
unusual
posture
of
this
case.
this
case,
as
you
know,
was
brought
by
a
pro
se
litigant
to
file
the
complaint.
the
complaint
was
immediately
dismissed
on
the
grounds
that
the
ncaa
is
in
some
sense
not
subject
to
title
ix
or
at
least
not
on
the
basis
of
the
allegations
in
that
complaint.
and
she
amended
her
complaint,
and
in
the
amended
complaint,
she
alleges
quite
plainly
at
paragraph
65,
which
since
the
amended
complaint
was
only
added
to
the
record
afterwards,
it's
unfortunately
not
in
the
joint
appendix,
but
it
has
been
lodged,
the
ncaa
is
a
recipient
of
federal
funds
because
it
is
an
entity
which
receives
federal
financial
assistance
through
another
recipient
and
operates
an
educational
program
or
activity
which
receives
or
benefits
from
such
assistance.
and
it
seems
quite
plain
to
me
that
if
you
give
any
kind
of
a
liberal
interpretation
to
the
pleadings
of
a
pro
se
litigant
in
the
context
of
that
case,
that
that
allegation
has
raised
a
whole
slew
of
theories
as
to
why
the
ncaa
ought
to
be
regarded
at
a
minimum
as
a
recipient,
either
direct
or
indirect.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
at
the
time
of
the
complaint,
no,
your
honor.
she
was
not.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
she
was
in
law
school
at
the
time.
and
as
a
consequence
of
that,
then
it
seems
to
me
that
we
look
at
the...
at
the
national
youth
sports
program
issue
that's
been
posed
in
this
case.
and
the
suggestion
that
somehow
there
is
anything
that
this
court
should
do
other
than
allow
that
matter
to
go
back
to
the
third
circuit
seems
to
me
largely
fanciful
because
it
is
clear
that
ms.
smith
raised
that
argument
explicitly
in
her
brief
in
the
third
circuit,
contrary
to
the
argument
made
by
petitioner
in
its
opening
brief.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
i
don't
know
whether
it
considered
it.
it
didn't
address
it
explicitly,
mr.
chief
justice.
on
the
other
hand,
it
had
an
alternative
theory
in
mind
that
was
perfectly
sufficient
on
which
to
send
the
matter
back.
and
remember,
we're
talking
about
sending
it
back
to
allow
her
to
amend
the
complaint
and
then
to
proceed
with
discovery
into
a
wide
range
of
issues,
including
the
nature
of
the
national
youth
sports
program
and
the
nature
of
the
relationship
between
the
ncaa
and
all
of
its
member
institutions.
so,
it's
not
surprising
that
the
third
circuit
wouldn't
reach
out
for
alternative
grounds
for
reaching
essentially
a
result
that
just
moves
this
litigation
from
square
one
to
a
baby
step--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--as
i
know
all
too
well,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
appreciate
that.
[laughter]
on
the
other
hand,
it
is...
but
the
one
thing
that's
absolutely
important
in
the
process
is
to
recognize
that
the
issue,
as
it
appears
on
the
record
before
this
court
at
this
time,
was
squarely
presented
below.
it
is
squarely
accepted
as
a
legitimate
basis
for
going
forward
at
the...
at
the
complaint
stage,
remembering
that
there
are
two
federal
district
courts
that
not
only
have
upheld
this
theory
at
the
complaint
stage,
but
have
held
that
if
you
get
into
the
evidence
and
you
find
out
the
nature
of
the
relationship
between
the
ncaa
and
this
source
of
federal
funding,
you'll
ultimately
think
that
there
is
an
ultimate
question
of
fact
that
must
go
to
a
trier
of
fact
with
respect
to
the
coverage
of
the
ncaa
as
an...
as
a
recipient
under
the
statute.
so--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--it's
preserved.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
it
is
not
clear
from
the
complaint--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--exactly
which
way,
but
i
think
it
could
be
read,
frankly,
to
embrace
both--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--of
those
theories
as...
in
terms
of
how
it
was
developed
and
certainly
in
terms
of
how
it's
been
argued
from
henceforth.
and
if
the
theory
is
you
go
back
and
amend
the
complaint,
it
seems
quite
clear
that
both
of
those
alternative
rationales
should
be
available
to
her
and
we
should
be
allowed
to
engage
in
discovery
along
those
lines.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
there
are
two
answers
to
that.
first
of
all,
there
is
a
statement
and
an
affidavit
in
response
to
the
initial
complaint
that
does,
in
fact,
identify
this
program
as
an
entity
that
receives
federal
funds.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
right.
well,
my
alternative
argument
is
that
even
a
pro
se
plaintiff
is
allowed
to
make
the
basic
claim
that
somebody
is
a
recipient
because
they
received
money
from
some
other
entity.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--but,
justice
scalia,
the
issue
now
comes
to
the
court
on
a
remand
for...
for
leave
to
file
an
amended
complaint
and
which
we
all
know,
to
a
moral
certainty,
the
facts
that
will
support
the
amendment
of
the
complaint
and
allow
this
case
to
go
forward
at
this
stage
in
the
litigation.
that's
all.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
you
might--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--you...
well,
you
get
at
least
one
more
swing
i
hope.
but
basically,
justice
scalia,
that's
not
the
posture
of
the
case.
the
third
circuit
has
already
set
aside
the
district
court's
dismissal
and
did
so
on
the
grounds
that
the...
that
the
district
court
abused
its
discretion
under
rule
15.
and
let's
be
clear
about
that.
that
issue
was
not
presented
by
the
ncaa.
they
didn't
raise
that
issue.
they
didn't
have
any
quarrel
with
the
idea
of
rule
15.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
12(b)(6).
it
was
a
motion--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--exactly.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
that...
that...
my
view
is
that
the
allegations
are
sufficient
to...
to
get
past
the
rule
12(b)(6)
motion,
justice
scalia.
but...
but
certainly
in
the
posture
of
a
case
where
it's
been
sent
back
for
allowing
an
amendment
to
the
complaint
at
this
stage--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--well,
no,
the
affidavit
was
before
the
district
court.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
so,
i
mean,
that's...
that's
part
of
the
overall
record
that
was
before
the
court
of
appeal,
and
the
issue
was
clearly
raised.
and
it
seems
to
me
at
the
very
outset
of
the
litigation,
you--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--mr.
chief
justice,
you're
going
to
have
to
ask
mr.
roberts
the
rationale
for
the
ncaa
putting
the...
putting
the
affidavit
before.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
yes,
your
honor.
so...
but
the
basic
point
here
is...
remains,
at
least
in
my
judgment
at
this
stage
as
the
case
comes
to
this
court,
the
proper
course
at
a
minimum
to
follow
is
to
send
it
back
to
allow
the
proceedings
to
go
on
with
respect
to
the
relationship
between
the
ncaa
and
the
national
youth
sports
program.
now
i'd
like
to
address
what
i
think
is
the
more
central
legal
issue
in
this
case,
at
least
in
my
judgment.
and
you
will
notice
that
in
mr.
roberts'
analysis
of
this
case,
he
spends
very
little
time
focusing
on
the
statutory
language,
jumping
ahead
instead
to...
to
decisions
of
this
court.
i'd
like
to
go
back
to
the
statutory
language
because
i
don't
believe,
frankly,
that
you
need
to
be
an
actual
federal
fund
recipient
under
section
901(a)
in
an
action
brought
as
a
private
right
of
action
against
a
defendant
who
is
clearly
a
wrongdoer
in
the
context
of
the
allegations
of
this
complaint.
this
court
held
in
gwinnett
that...
the
rule
has
been
around
for
at
least
a
hundred
years,
and
perhaps
even
longer,
going
back
to
blackstone...
that
all
wrongdoers
can
be
held
liable
on
damages
for
the
wrongs
that
they
do.
and
they
should
be...
and
they
should
realize
that
they're
put
on
notice,
that
when
they
engage
in
actions
that
violate
statutes,
that
the
person
who's
been
injured
by
that,
and
particularly
the
person
who
was
in
the
special
class
of
people
to
be
protected,
is
allowed
to
come
forward
and
seek
damages
for
that
particular
injury.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
the
language
of
901(a),
which
says
that
no
one
shall
be
excluded
from
participation
in
a
federally
funded
activity
on
the
basis
of
sex,
specifically,
explicitly,
and
completely
covers
the
situation
posed
by--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--that's
correct,
justice
o'connor.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
that's
correct,
but--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--well,
depending--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--depending
on
how
you
view
the...
the
sports
program.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
right,
not
through
the
membership
dues.
on
the
other
hand,
justice
o'connor,
recognize
that
the
language
does
not
define
the
class
of
defendants.
it
says
you
can't
be
excluded
from
a
program
or
activity,
and
there's
no
question
that
playing
volleyball
at
the
intercollegiate
level
is
a
program
or
activity
that
is
federally
funded
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
no,
of
course,
not.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
because
at
a
minimum
it
seems
to
me--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--it
doesn't
work
so
that
if
you
open
the
door
to...
to
an
entity
that
has
been
ceded
control
and
authority
over
the
operation
of
the
program
as
opposed
to
over
the
operation
of
the
participants
in
the
program--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--no.
what
i
am
saying
is,
is
that
the
plain
language
of
the
statute
doesn't
permit
the
ncaa
or
this
court
to
limit
the
scope
of
901(a)'s
protections
solely
to
those
who
actually
receive
federal
funds.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
i'm
sure
there
will
be
others
as
well.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
i
think--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--i
think
that
the
genius
of
this
court's
decision
last
term
in
gebser
is
in
its
holding
that
once
the
court
determines
that
basic
liability
coverage
applies...
and
gebser
was
clearly
a
federal
fund
recipient
and
it
did
apply...
and
it
found
right
that
the
ncaa
ought
to
be
subject
to
901(a)
liability
in
the
first
instance,
the
question
then
becomes
how
do
you
structure
the
rules
of
liability
in
a
way
that
is
consistent
with
congress'
overall
intent.
and
my
feeling
about
the
bully
and
the
problem
that
he
poses,
one,
the
regulations
focus
very
much
more
on
entity
and
controlling
operations.
and
the
court
can
certainly
limit
liability
consistent
with
that.
second
of
all,
the
legislative
history
of
title
vi
and
the
legislative
history
of
the
civil
rights
restoration
act
spends
a
great
deal
of
time
focusing
on
concerns
about
extending
liability
to
individuals.
that's
why
they
didn't
have
ultimate
beneficiaries
be
subject
to
liability
under
that...
under
those
statutes.
and
therefore,
it's
reasonable
to
confine
the
scope
of
the
901
remedy
to
people
who...
to
things
that
are
not
individuals.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
but,
of
course,
that's
not
posed
by
this
case,
but
clearly
that's...
that's
the
way--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--i...
i
would
argue,
mr.
chief
justice,
that
paralyzed
veterans
construed
the
language
in
section
902(1)
which
is
targeted
specifically
at
federal
fund
recipients.
and
that's
a
very
important
distinction
between
these
two
provisions.
the
private
right
of
action
case...
cases
come
out
of
901(a).
the
federal
regulatory
cases
and...
and
paralyzed
veterans
on
at
least
two
separate
occasions
specifically
identifies
the
scope
of
what
it's
aimed
at
at
the
federal
regulatory
authority,
and
that
comes
from
902(1).
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
it
could
potentially
be
broader.
there
is--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--well,
it
may
not...
yes,
in
the
sense
that--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--clearly
the
10-point
fund
termination
provision
would
not
be
available.
whether
it's
possible
that
the
other
enforcement
mechanisms
of
902(2)
could
be
brought
to
bear
it
seems
to
me
an
open
question
that's
not
really
posed
here.
so,
it
may
be
that
you
could
eventually
bring
them
in
sync.
in
the
short
run,
absent
regulations,
you're
right--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--i
think
the
answer
to
that
has
to
be
that
the
purpose
of
adopting
and
why
congress
did
adopt
an
explicit...
or
not
an
explicit...
an
implicit
private
right
of
action
was
to
ensure
enforcement,
recognizing
that
there
would
be
situations
where
the
most
effective
enforcement
would
come
at
the
hands
of
the
person
who
was
directly
affected.
and
if
that
requires
going
beyond
the
immediate
federal
fund
recipients,
that's
fine.
and
there's
one
other
rationale
for
that.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
okay.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
i...
i...
it's
hard
for
me
to
imagine
a
situation
in
which
you
comply
with
those...
with
those
and
that
that
interpretation
is
consistent
with
chevron--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--where
you
could
then
construe
the
statute
in
a
way
that
would
be
different
from
that.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
no,
but
that's
because...
justice
scalia,
that's
the
distinction
between
901
and
902,
and
what
you're
saying
is
that
when
we...
when
we
use
the
entire
regulatory
enforcement
powers
of
902...
and
let's
be
clear,
that
was
the
second
point
i
was
trying
to
make,
justice
stevens.
it's
one
thing
to
say
we're
not
going
allow
you
to
intentionally
intrude
into
the
operation
and
program
and
to
exclude
someone
on
the
basis
of
their
sex
and...
and
we're
going
to
provide
a
direct
remedy
to
that
problem.
but
it's
a
vastly
different
thing
to
say
that
we're
going
to
impose
the
entire
regulatory
regime
of
the
federal
government
on
you
in
circumstances
where
you
didn't
voluntarily
accept
the
federal
funding
under
a
particular
set
of
circumstances.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
that's
why...
that's
to
me
why
they
shouldn't
necessarily
be
congruent.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
in
some
circumstances.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
right.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
no,
no,
and
there
is...
there
are
two
principles.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
no,
no.
i'm
sorry
about
that,
justice
breyer.
there
are
two
principles
at
stake
here.
one
deals
with
the
question
of
whether
individuals
necessarily
go
along
if
you
bring
organizations
in,
and
i
was
suggesting
that
i
think
you
can
make
distinctions
there.
the
second
one
is
that...
the
basic
theory
of
the
brief,
which
is
that
it's
only
in
situations
in
which
the
defendant
has
been
ceded
control
and
authority
to
make
the
final
exclusionary
decision.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
i
didn't
mean
to
exclude
that.
i
was--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--it's
a
delegation
of
control
theory.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
below
not
at
all,
but
i
think
it's
important
to
realize
that
this
is
an
invited
answer
by
the
respondents
in
this
case.
if
you
look
at
the
question
presented
in
the
cert
petition,
it's...
it
was
initially
a
fairly
narrow
question.
if
you
look
at
the
ncaa's
first
five
pages
of
its
argument,
the
argument
says,
this
statute
is
strictly
limited
to
federal
fund
recipients
and
no
one
else.
and...
and
therefore
we
responded
to
the
ncaa's
effort
to
expand
the
scope
of
the
argument.
i
think
it's
subsumed
within
the
question
presented,
to
be
sure,
and
we
joined
issue
with
them,
and
they've
joined
issue
with
us
back.
so,
i
think
the
issue
is
squarely
presented
by
the
circumstances
of
this
particular
case.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
this
brings
us
back
to
the
same
basic
problem
that
i
had
at
the
outset,
which
is
let's
remember
the
posture
of
this
case.
this
is
on
a
motion
to
dismiss
at
the
very
earliest
stages
of
the
litigation.
what
we're
saying
is
that
as
a
legal
theory,
you
can't
stop
at
the
federal
fund
recipient.
you
have
to
go
beyond
that,
and
in
order
to
figure
out,
one,
where
you
go
beyond
that
and
whether
that's
a
legitimate
basis
for
imposing
liability
in
this
circumstance
and
how
it
would
apply
elsewhere,
we
need
the
discovery
to
understand
the
relationship
between
these...
between
the
members
and
their
organization.
and
then
i'll
be
in
a
position
frankly
to
be
able
to
answer
the
question
about
how
other
organizations--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--right,
and
we
don't...
and
we
do
not
embrace
the
broadest
view
inside
the
third
circuit's
analysis.
i
don't
think...
and
i
don't
think
the
court
needs
to
go
there
in
order
to
allow
what
i
think
is
ultimately
the
right
answer
here,
which
is
to
permit
this
case
to
go
beyond
the
complaint
stage
to
allow
us
the
opportunity
to
engage
in
the
kind
of
discovery
and
to
flush
out
the
legal
theories
that
have
been
presented
to
this
court.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
we
have...
we
have...
the
complaint
does
add
the
schools.
i
think
the
schools
have
raised
a
statute
of
limitations
issue,
but
obviously
it
hasn't
gone
anywhere
given
the
posture
of
the
case.
if
there
are
no
other
questions,
i
urge
affirmance
and
cede
the
podium
to
mr.
kneedler.
