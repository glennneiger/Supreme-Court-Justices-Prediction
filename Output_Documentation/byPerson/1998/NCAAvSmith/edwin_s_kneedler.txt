mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
third
circuit
decided
this
case,
at
least
as
petitioner
understands
it,
on
a
theory
that
someone
in
the
position
of
the
ncaa
can
be
subject
to
suit
under
title
ix
solely
on
the
ground
that
it
is
a
mere
beneficiary
of
the
program
and
on
that
ground
alone.
we
agree
with
petitioner
that
that
reading...
if
that
is
what
the
third
circuit
meant
to
hold,
that
that
is
incorrect,
and
that
that
is
inconsistent
with
the
decision
in
paralyzed
veterans.
all
that
this
court
needs
to
decide
is
that
that
particular
theory
was
incorrect
and
it
could
remand
for
consideration
of
alternative
theories.
for
example,
the
petition
in
this
case
presents
the
question
on
the
assumption
that
petitioner
is
not
a
recipient,
but
is...
does
its
receipt
of
payments...
does
the
receipt
of
payments
by
a
non-recipient
essentially
on
the
benefit
theory
subject
it
to
liability?
the
question...
the
question
of,
however,
of
whether
the
ncaa
is
a
recipient,
either
because
the
colleges
operate
programs
and
pay
dues
which
pass
on
some
of
the
federal
financial
assistance,
or
alternatively,
because
of
the
health
and
human
services
grant
that
is...
that
is
made
to
the
national
youth
sports
program,
operated
and
administered
according
to
the
ncaa's
own
constitution
by
a
committee
of
the
ncaa,
whether
either
of
those
theories
of
being
a
recipient
subjects
it
to
coverage
is
not,
i
think,
within
the
question
presented
and
could
properly
be
considered
on
remand.
the
other
question
of
whether
the
ncaa
is
subject
to
suit
under
title
ix,
because
it
has
been
ceded
controlling
authority
over
the
operation
of
the
program
in
certain
particulars,
was
i
think
fairly
raised
in
the
court
of
appeals
on
pages
5,
9,
and
22
of
the
respondent's
brief,
but
that
too
was
not
addressed
by
the
court
of
appeals
and
could
be
considered
on
remand.
i
think
it's
important,
though,
in
leaving
these
questions
open
for
the
court
of
appeals,
for
this
court
not
to
rule
out
the
possibility
or
not
to
foreclose
as
a
matter
of
law
any
of
these
various
theories
because
this
case
is
at
a
very
preliminary
stage,
and
the
court...
the
district
court--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--yes.
there's
no
doubt...
there's
no
doubt
that
that
has
been
briefed.
my...
my
only...
my
only
point
was
this
court
does
not
need
to
resolve
that
question
because
it
was
not
addressed
by
the
third
circuit.
my
only
point
was
that--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--right.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
i
think
it
might
be...
the--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
the...
the...
the
only
legal
issue
in
the
case
would
be
are...
is
it...
is
there
a
categorical
rule
that
can
a
non-recipient
never
be
held
liable
under
title
ix.
if
that...
if
that...
only
that
question
i
think
is
presented,
but
i
do
think...
on
this
record
because
this
comes
up
in
a
motion
to
dismiss,
but
i
think
that
may
be
a
question
in
which
the
court
might
be
informed
by
a
fully
developed
record
when
that
situation
comes
up
in
terms
of
knowing
the...
more
facts
about
the
relationship
between
the
ncaa
and
the...
and
the
member
institutions.
in
fact--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--i...
not
definitively
because--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--the
member
institutions--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--right.
the
member...
the
member
institutions,
as
this
court
pointed
out
in...
in
both
of
its
prior
cases
involving
the
ncaa,
are
bound
to
implement
that
the...
follow
the
rules
of
the
ncaa
and
to
implement
the
determinations
of
eligibility
in
particular
cases.
and
there's
no
reason
to
think
that
the
member
institutions
wouldn't
be
required
to
do
that,
which
is
precisely
why
we
believe
that
they...
that
the
ncaa
has
been
ceded
controlling
authority
over
particular
participation--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--right.
no,
i...
i
agree
with
that.
i...
i...
i
would
like
to
address,
though,
the...
the
argument
to
the
extent
this
court
is--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
i...
i
think
knowing--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
i
think...
i
think
knowing
exactly
what
that
means,
that's
descriptive,
but
knowing
exactly
how
that
operates--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
it...
looked
at
in
that
way--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
there...
there
are
two
questions
here.
one
is...
one
is
the
prudential
consideration
with
respect
to
the
development
of
facts,
and
another
is
the
fact
that
this
issue
was
not
addressed
by
the
court
of
appeals
on...
on
the
law.
and
this
court
doesn't...
as
the
chief
justice
pointed
out,
does
not
normally
address
legal
issues
that
were
not
resolved
below.
but
let
me...
let
me
address
the...
the
legal
issue
on
the
premise
that
the
court
might
choose
to
address
it.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
right.
no,
i
agree
with
that.
but...
but
on...
if...
if
the
court
is
disposed
to
consider
whether
the
absolute
rule
that...
that
the
ncaa
seems
to
be
arguing
for
here,
i
think
it's
important
to--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--right.
and
i
think
it's
important...
i
think
it's
important
to
consider,
as
mr.
phillips
pointed
out,
that...
that
the
operative
provision
under
which
this
court
found
the
private
right
of
action
identifies
the
class
of
protected
persons,
but
does
not
identify
a
class
of
defendants.
so,
i...
i
think
the
categorical
rule
is
not
supported
by
the
very
provision
under
which
the
right
of
action
has
been
implied.
that
is
not
to
say,
however,
that
everybody
who
may
have
some
effect...
discriminatory
impact
on...
on
the
program
is
covered,
and
it's
important
to
look--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
it...
i
think
in
this...
in
this
case
in
particular
it
does
not
because
what
section
901
says
is
that
there
shall
be
no
discrimination
in
a
program
receiving
federal
assistance,
not
a
program
operated
by
a
recipient,
but
a
program
that
receives
federal
financial
assistance.
there's
no
doubt
that
the
intercollegiate
athletic
programs
of
all...
of
probably
the
vast
majority
of
the
ncaa's
member
institutions
receive
federal
financial
assistance.
the...
and
ordinarily,
if
you
look
at
1687,
it
refers
to
the
operations
of
a...
of
a
program
or
activity.
the
question
then
i
think
is
who
operates
it.
ordinarily
it's
the
recipient,
but
where
the
recipient
has
basically
ceded
control
to
what
is,
in
effect,
a
super
board
of
trustees
for
purposes
of
establishing
rules
or
making
individual
determinations
for
the
college
that
are
binding
on
the
college,
it
seems
to
me
a
straightforward
application
of...
of
section
901
and
looking
at
1687
in
terms
of
who
operates
the
program.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
i...
our...
our
position
here
is
solely
where
the...
where,
in
effect,
the
board
of
trustees,
which
would
otherwise
have
final
decision
making
authority
for
the
recipient,
turns
that
final
decision
making
authority
over
to
what
is,
in
effect,
a
superior
governing
authority.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
yes,
and
under
the
title
ix
regulations,
that
makes
that
clear.
i'd
like
to
just
for
a
moment
address
another
point
that...
that
mr.
roberts
made
with
respect
to
the
recipient
theory
and
whether
the
ncaa
is
an
intended
recipient.
the
question
is
not
whether
congress
intended
the
ncaa
as
an
entity
to
receive
federal
funds.
the
question...
the...
and
i
think,
justice
scalia,
you're
right.
intent
is
really
not
the
right
question.
the
question
is
whether
the
program
being
operated
is
of
the
type
that
the
federal
grant
program
was
intended
to
fund.
and...
and
the
question
then
is
whether
the...
whether
the
program
is
the
sort
of
thing
that
was
intended
to
be
funded.
as
the
court
said,
the
college
program
in
grove
city
was
what
was
intended
to
be
funded.
there's
no
doubt
here
that
intercollegiate
athletics
are
part
of
a
college
program.
the
question
would
be
whether
the
various
federal
programs
that
might
or
might
not
be
involved
in
this
case...
and
again,
there's
been
no
exploration
on
that...
extend
funding
to
the
whole
college,
including
its
athletic
department,
and
then
whether
the
payment
of
dues
is
essentially
the
transmittal
of
that
federal
financial
assistance.
but
the
question
is
not
whether
a
particular
entity
was
intended
to
have
that...
to
receive
that.
the
regulation
that
we
cite
in
our
brief
with
respect
to
transferees
and
successors...
and
there's
another
regulation
in
the
title
ix
regulations
that
refers
to
contractors...
shows
that
aid
can
be
passed
on.
