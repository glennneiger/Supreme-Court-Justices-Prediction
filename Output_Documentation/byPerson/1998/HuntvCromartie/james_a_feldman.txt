mr.
james
a.
feldman
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
summary
judgment
record
in
this
case
was
inefficient
to...
was
insufficient
to
establish,
as
a
matter
of
undisputed
fact,
that
the
state's
predominant
motive
in
drawing
district
12
was
race.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
i
think
the--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--i
think
that
that...
i
think
the...
the
fact
that
there
were
substantial
parts
of
the
district
that
may
have
been
put
there
for
racial
reasons
would
be
evidentiarily
very
significant,
but
i
don't
think
the
fact
that
there
were
a
few
isolated
pockets
would
be
sufficient
to
establish
a
predominant
motive.
in
shaw
against
hunt,
the
court
explained
a
predominant
motive
as
being
that
that
couldn't
be
compromised
in
drawing
the
district.
it
was
really
the
basis
of
the
district,
the
one
thing
that
couldn't
be...
couldn't
be
eliminated.
once...
and
i
think
that
that's
what
you
have
to
show.
now,
the--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--i
agree
with
you.
in
that...
that
area,
the
court
wouldn't
and
i
think
it
would
be
correct.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
no,
i
don't
think
so.
the
court
has--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--it
can
be
in
how
you
drew
a--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--it
can...
it
can
be
a...
it
can
be
a
determinative
factor
in
how
some
isolated
portion
of
a
district
was
drawn,
along
with
many
other
factors,
like
going
to
putting
a
plan
together.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
i'm
not
sure
that
the
hypothetical...
i'm
not
sure
it's
sketched
out
enough
for
me
to
give
a
yes
or
no
answer,
but
i
think
the
main
point
is--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--i...
i
take...
first
of
all,
i--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--i
take
the
court's
decisions
where
it's
repeatedly
talked
about
the
predominant
motive,
not
just
any
motive
or
not
just
something
that
was
a
factor--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--i
think
that
in
the
miller
case
the
court
talked
about
a
predominant
motive
for
a
substantial
number
of
people.
so,
already
there,
that
i
think
excludes
the
case
where
there
was
some
small
portion
of
the
district
that...
that
may
have
had
race
as
a
factor
in
considering
a
community
of
interests
or
what
ties
together
people
in
a
particular
area.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
well,
i...
i
think
the
rationale
would
be
that
the
court
has...
when
it's
discussed
the
issue,
has
talked...
has
mentioned
the
fact
that
race...
legislators
commonly
are
aware
of
race
when
they
draw
a
district,
as
they
are
aware
of
many
of
the
other
demographic
factors
of
the
district
they're
drawing.
and
the
court
has--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--right,
but
i
think
given
that
awareness,
the
court
has
also
said,
or
at
least
the
plurality
said,
in
bush
that
the
mere
desire
to
draw
even
a
majority-minority
district,
which
this
isn't,
that
even
that
doesn't...
doesn't
render
it
automatically
subject
to
strict
scrutiny.
i
think
you
have
to
look
and
see
what
was
the...
i
think
you
have
to
go
back
to
the
shaw
line
of
cases
and
the
kinds
of
harms
that
the
court
identified
as
underlying
the
shaw
doctrine,
and
those
harms
don't
necessarily
occur,
the
kinds
of
beliefs
that
one...
people...
a
congressperson
may
believe
that
he
or
she
is
only
there
to
represent
one
race
or
the
balkanization
of
the
electorate.
i
don't
think
those
harms
are
necessarily
there
if
they're
some
small
part
of
a
district
where
a
state
has
taken
race
into
account
in
saying
that
in
order
to
have...
there's
a
community
of
interest
here
that
isn't--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--for...
for
a
small...
i
believe
that's
the
position
that
the
court
has
taken
when
it
has
talked
about
the
predominant
motive
of
drawing
districts.
i
want
to
add
one
other--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--you
know,
i...
i'm
not
sure
i'm
saying
that
because
it
may
be
that
the
question
of
avoiding
a
section
2
or
section
5
violation
may
be
relevant.
it
may
or
may
not
be.
it
may
be
relevant
at
the
later
stage
of
determining
whether
something
is
subject
to
strict
scrutiny.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
no,
i
don't--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--i
think
that
what
you're
describing
is
a
case
where
someone
is
trying
to
dilute
either
the
white,
black,
or
the
black
vote.
i
don't
really...
i'm
not
sure
which,
but
i
don't
think
that
would
be
okay.
but
i
do
think
when
the
court
has
recognized
repeatedly
that...
that
a
legislature
can
take
race
into
consideration
and
even
can
determine
that
it
wants
to
draw
a
majority-minority
district--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--but...
but--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--and
i...
i
think
that...
as
i
said
before,
where
that
would
be...
it
may
be
very
powerful
evidence
that
the
predominant
motive
in
drawing
the
district
is
race,
but
i
don't
think
that
it's...
as
the
case--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--when
the
court
has
said
that
a
motive
for
drawing
a
district
can
be
race,
i
think
it
necessarily
means
that
there
can
be
some
portion
of
a
district
where
that
is
a
motive
in
drawing
one
part
of
a
district
line.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
that...
that's
correct.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
that...
that's
correct.
i
was
going
to
get
to
that
point.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
but
i
don't
think
on
this
point,
on
a
summary
judgment
record,
you
can
conclude
that
any
line
in
this
district
was
drawn
in
order...
was
drawn
predominantly
or
even
motivated
by
race.
all
you
have
in
the
record--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--right.
i
don't
think
you
could
even...
yes,
i
don't
think
you
could
conclude
that
on
the
summary
judgment
motion
in
this
case.
all
you
have
is
the
legislators
admitting
that
they
took
racial
fairness
into
account,
which
means...
may
well
mean
that
they
drew
the
districts
as
they
said,
in
accordance
with
partisan
political
considerations,
looking
at
the
actual
voting
of
the
people
on...
of
various
precincts
on
election
day--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--and
the
after
that--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--i...
i
take
that
to
mean,
if
you
read
the
affidavit,
to
mean
they
were
conscious
of
their
obligations
under
sections
2
and
5--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--and...
no,
i
don't
think
so.
and
under
this
court's
decision
in
shaw,
that
they
drew
the
districts,
as
they
said,
in
order
to
achieve
certain
partisan
goals
to
get
those
election-day
democrats
in
the
district.
having
done
that,
they
looked
at
their
results
as
federal...
as
federal
law
requires
and
to
see
whether
it
complies
with
sections
2
and
5.
it's
completely
consistent
with
this
record
that
every
line
in
this
district
was
drawn
for
partisan
political
reasons,
and
there
was
no
line
that
was
motivated
for
race.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
that's
right,
and...
and
yes,
that's
correct.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
that's
correct,
and
i...
i
think
that
was
where
the
district
court
went
wrong,
because
it
was
completely
consistent
with
the
state's
evidence
to
say,
well,
there
are
some
registered
democrats
who
are
left
out,
to
say
what
the
legislature
claimed
it
did
was
not
trying
to
draw
districts
that
had
a
lot
of
registered
democrats,
it
was
trying
to
draw
a
district
that
had
precincts
that
include
those
who
would
reliably
vote
democratic
on
election
day.
and
i
think
the
experts'
evidence
and
the
maps
and,
indeed,
even
the
maps
that
the
plaintiffs
put
in
make
quite
clear
that
at
least
that
explanation
is
very
consistent
with
all
of
the
facts.
therefore,
summary
judgment
couldn't
have
been
granted
on
this
record.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
i--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--no.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
no.
i
don't...
i
don't
think
the
district
court
has
to...
has
to...
has
to
do
that,
but
there's
no
reason
to
think
that
the
district
court
in
this
case
did
do
that.
and
once
the
legislature
draws
a
new
district
that
is
substantially
different,
as
this
one
was,
from
the
old
district,
i
think
any
causal
connection
between
the
old
one
and
the
new
one
is
broken
and--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--thank
you.
