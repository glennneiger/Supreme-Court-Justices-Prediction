thomas
first
case
i
have
to
announce
is
hunt
versus
cromartie,
number
98-85.
this
case
comes
to
us
on
appeal
from
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
eastern
district
of
north
carolina.
in
shaw
versus
hunt,
we
held
that
the
north
carolina’s
district
12,
was
a
product
of
an
unconstitutional
racial
gerrymander.
in
response
to
our
decision,
the
state
enacted
a
new
districting
plan.
appellees,
however
believed
that
the
(inaudible)
also
was
unconstitutionally
informed
and
brought
suit
against
several
state
officials
seeking
to
enjoin
elections
from
being
held
pursuant
to
this
new
plan.
before
discovery
and
without
an
evidentiary
hearing,
the
district
court
granted
summary
judgment
in
appellee's
favor
and
entered
in
an
injunction.
in
the
district
court’s
view,
the
uncontroverted
material
facts
showed
that
the
state
used
racial
criteria
in
drawing
district
12.
in
our
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
we
reverse.
districting
legislation
ordinarily,
is
race
neutral
on
its
face.
it
classifies
tracts
of
land,
precincts
or
census
blocks.
the
task
of
assessing
a
jurisdiction’s
motive
therefore
is
an
inherently
complex
endeavor.
one
requiring
careful
inquiry
into
such
circumstantial
and
direct
evidence
as
may
be
available.
appellees
presented
evidence
showing
district
12,
size,
shape
and
alleged
lack
of
continuity.
they
also
presented
statistical
and
demographic
evidence
reporting
to
show
that
at
several
points
along
district
12’s
boundary,
heavily
black
districts
were
included
within
district
12,
while
precincts
that
were
equally
democratic
in
terms
of
voter
registration
were
excluded.
on
the
whole
and
viewed
in
light
of
our
prior
cases
appellee's
evidence
tends
to
support
an
inference
that
the
state
drew
its
district
lines
with
an
impressible
racial
motivation.
but
summary
judgment
is
appropriate
only
where
there
is
no
genuine
issue
of
material
fact.
the
state’s
motivation
is
a
factual
question
and
was
sufficiently
put
in
dispute
by
appellants.
appellants
argue
that
the
state’s
districting
plan
was
drawn
with
the
intent
to
make
district
12,
a
strong
democratic
district.
they
supported
their
contention
with
affidavits
from
two
state
legislatives.
more
important
they
offered
affidavit
testimony
from
an
expert
witness,
who
analyze
voting
results
in
addition
to
party
registration
figures
and
who
examined
district
12’s
entire
border
as
oppose
to
select
points
along
that
border.
in
the
expert’s
view
the
underlying
data
supported
a
political
motivation
at
least
as
well
as
and
somewhat
better
than
a
racial
explanation.
accepting
appellants
political
motivation
explanation
as
true
as
is
required
at
the
summary
judgment
stage,
the
fact
of
the
legislature’s
motivation
was
in
dispute
and
appellees
were
not
entitled
to
judgment
as
matter
of
law.
a
jurisdiction
may
engage
in
constitutional
political
gerrymandering,
even
if
it
so
happens
that
the
most
loyal
democrats
are
black
democrats,
and
even
if
the
state’s
legislature
was
conscious
of
that
fact.
we
do
not
hold
that
summary
judgment
may
be
never
be
held
in
the
plaintiff’s
favor
in
a
racial
gerrymandering
case
like
this
one,
sought
to
be
proved
exclusively
by
circumstantial
evidence.
we
can’t
imagine
an
instance
where
the
reasonable
inference
is
to
be
drawn
in
the
non
moving
party’s
favor
would
not
be
significantly
probative
so
as
to
create
a
genuine
issue
of
material
fact.
but
appellant’s
evidence
is
not
of
that
character.
we
also
do
not
express
position
on
the
merits.
the
district
court
is
more
familiar
with
the
evidence
than
we
are,
and
it
may
turn
out,
that
the
appellees
prove
their
claim
to
the
state
acted
with
an
impermissible
motivation.
summary
judgment
however
is
inappropriate
when
the
evidence
is
susceptible
of
different
interpretations
or
inferences
by
the
prior
fact.
justice
stevens
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
the
judgment
which
justices
souter,
ginsberg
and
breyer
have
joined.
