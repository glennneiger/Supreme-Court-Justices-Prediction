unknown
speaker
was
there
any
allegation
that
the...
the
precinct
numbers
were
used
as
a
surrogate
for
race;
that
is
to
say,
precinct
numbers
were
used
in
order
to
include
people
of
a
certain
race
in
the
district?
was
there
any
allegation
of
that
here?
unknown
speaker
mr.
dellinger,
you
say
that
there's
no
evidence,
but
i...
some
of
the
districts
that...
that
were
carved
up
in
order
to
create
this
unusually
shaped
district
or
some
of
the...
some
of
the
counties
were
indeed
overwhelmingly
democratic,
and
it
would
have
been
easy
to
put
in
more
democrats
without
putting
in
more
black
democrats.
and...
and
part
of
the
allegation
is
that
the...
what
was
done
shows
that
there
was
an
intentional
effort
not
only
to
get
in
democrats,
but
to
get
in
black
democrats.
and
that...
and
that
circumstantial
evidence
is...
is
affirmed
by
the...
the
affidavits
put
in
by
your
side
which
say
that
one
of
the
purposes
of
the
legislature
was
to...
was
to
retain
the
election
of
incumbents.
and
here
you
had
an
incumbent
who
had
been
elected
by
a
district
that
had
been
unconstitutionally
established
on
a
racial
basis,
and
to
simply
come
in
and
say,
well,
we
want
to
make
sure
that
he'll
get
reelected
is,
it
seems
to
me,
more
circumstantial
evidence.
i
mean--
unknown
speaker
--there
may
not
be
enough
evidence,
but
it
seems
to
me
to
go
too
far
to
say
that
there's
no
evidence
that...
that
there
was
any
racial
gerrymander
here.
unknown
speaker
mr.
dellinger,
may
i
just
interrupt
for
a
second?
unknown
speaker
let's
assume,
for
the
sake
of
argument,
that
there's
a...
there's
a
question
whether
the
chain
of
causation
is
broken
or
not.
isn't
it
your
position
that
you
still
win
here?
i
mean,
you're
arguing
summary
judgment.
and
the
question
is
whether
there
is
a
genuine
issue,
not
who
ultimately
wins.
am
i
right?
i
mean,
that's...
that's
really
the
structure
of
your
argument.
unknown
speaker
okay,
but--
unknown
speaker
--the
only
thing
we've
got
from...
in...
in
front
of
us
is...
is
an
appeal
from
a
grant
of
summary
judgment.
unknown
speaker
well,
that...
that's
true,
but--
--did
you
move
for
summary
judgment?
did
you
move
for
summary
judgment
below?
unknown
speaker
did
you
cross-appeal?
did
you-cross
appeal?
unknown
speaker
well,
we...
we--
unknown
speaker
--can't
give
you
a
judgment
here
that
is...
that
goes
beyond
what...
what
you've
asked
for.
unknown
speaker
well,
it
may
be
a
fully
explanatory
answer
if
we
assume
there
is
nothing
else
in
the
world
that
might
come
in
as
an
evidentiary
matter
here.
can
we
assume
that?
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
it
sounds
to
me
very
much
like
a
cross-appeal.
i
mean,
it's...
it's
one
thing
to
say
that
they
have
not
put
in
sufficient
evidence,
given
this
total
record,
upon
which
one
could
say
there
was
no
genuine
issue
and
they
were
entitled
to
judgment
as
a
matter
of
law.
but
i...
it
sounds
to
me
as
though
what
you're
arguing
is...
is
something
that
strikes
me
like...
like
a
cross-appeal,
which
you
didn't
take.
unknown
speaker
or
the
state
didn't
take.
unknown
speaker
well,
if
the
summary
judgment
case
wasn't
right,
you
could
have
the
injunction
vacated,
and
then
it
goes
back
presumably
for
further
development.
and
on
that
score,
i
wanted
to
ask,
having
had
a
preview
of
what's
going
on
in
the
summary
judgment
submissions,
what
would
the
state...
what
additional,
if
anything,
would
the
state
put
in
were
this
case
to
go
to
trial?
unknown
speaker
it's
the
other
side.
unknown
speaker
it's
the
other
side
that...
the
other
side,
if
they're
denied
summary
judgment,
that
i
guess
would
have
a
right
to
put
in
some
evidence.
i
mean,
if
we
deny...
if
we
said
you're
wrong
to
give
them
summary
judgment,
you're
wrong--
unknown
speaker
--wouldn't
that
automatically
say
to
you,
well,
if
the
law
doesn't
permit
them
to
win,
if
this
evidence
doesn't
permit
them
as
a
matter
to
law...
of
law
to
win,
it
must
permit
somebody
to
win?
so,
i
guess
they'd
have
to...
they'd
have
to
put
in
some
more
evidence
if
they
should
have
that
opportunity.
unknown
speaker
well,
that's
their
problem.
unknown
speaker
what
evidence...
what
evidence
do
you
have?
i
mean,
i
don't
think
we're
about
to
send
it
back
and
give
summary
judgment
in
the
other
direction
when
you
haven't
asked
for
it.
let's
talk
about
the
summary
judgment
that
you're
seeking
to
overturn.
unknown
speaker
and
now,
it...
it
has
to
be
evidence
showing
that
there
is
a
controverted
issue
of
fact.
suppose
the
evidence
showing
the
controversion
is
so
weak
in
light
of
the
evidence
on
the
other
side,
that
no
rational
person
would
believe
it.
is...
is
that
enough?
can
you
bring
in
a
10-times
felon
who
has
perjured
himself
in
so
many
cases
testifying
to
a
fact
that
is
inherently
incredible,
and
so
long
as
you
get
on
the
record
somebody
controverting
that
fact,
is
that
enough
to
get
you
by
summary
judgment?
unknown
speaker
so,
despite
these
statements
by
the
legislatures...
legislators
that,
oh,
no--
unknown
speaker
--this
was
just
politics,
it
is
conceivable
that
the
district
court
looked
at
those
statements,
looked
at
the...
looked
at
the
district
that
had
been
drawn,
looked
at
other
statements,
and
said
these
things
are
inherently
incredible.
that...
that's
at
least
up
for
grabs,
that
argument.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
didn't
mean
to
imply
that.
unknown
speaker
it
was
what
is
known
as
a
hypothetical
felon.
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
you
don't
contend
that
the
shaw
line
of
cases
and
miller
apply
only
to
majority-minority
districts,
do
you?
unknown
speaker
well,
it
seems
to
me
that
it
was
somewhat
troubling
for
some
of
those
who
drew
the
district
to
say,
good
news,
this
isn't
majority-minority.
that
seems
to
me
that's
a
misunderstanding--
unknown
speaker
--of
shaw
v.
miller.
unknown
speaker
--in
itself
circumstantial
evidence
that
impermissible
fact--
unknown
speaker
--very
well,
mr.
dellinger.
mr.
feldman,
we'll
hear
from
you.
unknown
speaker
what
does
a
predominant
motive
mean?
i'm...
i'm
a
little
unclear
about
that.
unknown
speaker
suppose...
suppose
the
district
would
have
been
drawn
almost
this
way,
but...
but
a
few
curves
in
it
were
put
there
just
for
racial
reasons.
does
that
make
it
not...
not
a
predominant
motive?
unknown
speaker
why
is...
why
is
that
the
test?
i
don't...
is
that
the
test
in
any...
any
other
civil
rights
areas
that
we
know
of?
i
mean,
do
we
say
if
somebody
fires
somebody
and,
you
know,
well,
yes,
race
was
what
finally
tipped
the
scales,
but
i
can't
say
it
was
the
predominant
factor?
this
was
a
person
who
didn't
really
work
very
well.
race
was
just
the
last
factor.
that...
that
was
the
straw
that
broke
the
camel's
back,
but
it
wasn't
the
predominant
factor.
we
certainly
wouldn't
say,
well,
that's
okay,
would
we?
unknown
speaker
so,
don't...
don't
you
think
predominant
maybe
just...
just
means
ultimately
determinative?
unknown
speaker
it
can
be
the
ultimately
determinative
factor
in
how
you
drew
this...
this
district.
unknown
speaker
but
if
it's
not
the
predominant
one,
it's
okay.
unknown
speaker
well,
do
you
have
to
look
at
the
whole
district?
are
you
saying
that
it's
lawful
for
us
to
say
we
know
the
basic
lines
of
the
district;
now
we're
going
to
add
10
percent
more
just
to
come
up
with
our...
and
we'll
put
all
of
one
racial
minority
in
that
just
to
help
them
out.
is...
is
that
lawful?
unknown
speaker
the
hypothetical,
as
i
understand
it,
can
you...
can
you
ever
use
race
specifically
in
designing
part
of
a
district?
unknown
speaker
if
your
only
motive
is
to
use
race
for
part
of
a
district,
can
you
do
that?
unknown
speaker
but
it
didn't
say
as
to
the
whole
district.
unknown
speaker
well,
what
would
be
the
rationale
which
would
allow
you
to
use...
to
use
race
only
as
the
sole
factor
in...
in
comprising
part
of
a
district?
what...
what
conceivable
rationale
would
allow
that
under
the
equal
protection
clause?
unknown
speaker
i'm
not
talking
about
awareness.
i'm
talking
about
specific
purpose.
unknown
speaker
so,
the
position
of
the
justice
department
is
that
in
drawing
districts,
race
and
race
only
can
be
taken
into
account
for
some
neighborhoods.
that's
your
position.
unknown
speaker
aren't
you
saying,
mr.
feldman,
that
the...
that
whatever
predominant
means,
it
at
least
does
not
include
cases
in
which
the
governing
motive
is
to
avoid
a
section
2
or
a
section
5
violation?
you're
saying
that
at
least,
aren't
you?
unknown
speaker
let
me
get
the
justice
department's
position
correct.
if...
if
you
have
some
legislators
who
want
to...
want
to
exclude
some
blacks
from
a
district
that
has
been,
for
many
years,
represented
by
a
white
congressman,
and
they're
worried
that
too
many
blacks
in
that
district
might
make
it
difficult
for
him
to
get
reelected
because
his
policies
have
generally
not
been
favored
by
blacks,
it
can
take
those
blacks
and
chop
them
out
of
his
district
and
put
them
into
this
new
gerrymandered
district
so
long
as
that's
not
a
big
part
of
that
district.
unknown
speaker
so
long
as
it's
only
a...
less
than
half?
unknown
speaker
but
they're
not
going
to
say
we
did
it
for
dilution.
they're...
we're
protecting
incumbents,
the
same
argument
that's
being
made
here.
we're
protecting
incumbents.
that's
why
we
drew
the
district.
unknown
speaker
to
protect
the
incumbents,
we
took
race
into
account
for
a
little...
for
a
little
bit
of
the
district.
unknown
speaker
so,
it
can
be
the
predominant
motive
for
just
a
little
part
of
the
district.
that
will
be
enough.
unknown
speaker
when
you
say
a
motive,
i
thought
this
was
a
case
in
which,
in
respect
to
all
groups
of
minority
voters,
the
state
was
saying,
look,
we
put
all
of
them
in
there
because
they're
democrats.
so,
our
predominant
motive
is
to
every
significant
group
was
that
they
were
democrats.
unknown
speaker
we
may
have
also
thought,
well,
fine.
they're
minorities
too.
we
like
that
idea
in
this
case.
but
i
mean,
that's
not
the
only
motive
for
even
those
people.
unknown
speaker
all
right.
then
i
don't
know
why
we're
going
into
this.
unknown
speaker
dominantly
it
was
never
only
motivated
by
race.
unknown
speaker
what
in
the
world
does
that
mean?
unknown
speaker
what
does...
they
took
racial
fairness
into
account.
what
in
the
world
does
that
mean?
unknown
speaker
to
use
race
in
drawing
the
districts.
unknown
speaker
you
had
a
statistician
who
said
that
it
was...
if
you
had
to
pick
between
the
two,
was
more
likely
political.
unknown
speaker
the
district
court
didn't
seem
to
do
anything
but
say,
well,
we're
talking
about
registered
democrats
here.
unknown
speaker
mr.
feldman,
don't
you
think
it's
appropriate
for
the
district
court
to
take
into
account
that
this
is
not
some
brand-new
legislature
that's
walked
up
here
creating
a
brand-new
district,
but
it's
a
legislature
that
has
been
told
to
redistrict
precisely
this
district
because
the
last
time
they
clearly
did
it
on...
on
a
racial
basis,
which
was
invalidated
by
the
courts
and
upheld
up
here?
unknown
speaker
do...
do
they
have
to
pretend
that
this
is
not
a
legislature
that
has
been
pulled
kicking
and
dragging
into...
into
drawing
a
fair
district?
unknown
speaker
and
then
when
they're
given
another
district
that
looks
pretty
much
like
the...
like
the
old
one,
they
cannot
take
that
into
account?
unknown
speaker
thank
you,
mr.
feldman.
unknown
speaker
mr.
everett,
we'll
hear
from
you.
unknown
speaker
well,
certainly
they
are,
but
i
think,
at
least
speaking
for
myself,
my
concern
is
that
there
may
well
have
been
sufficient
evidence
here
to
preclude
the
court
from
granting
summary
judgment
on
this
question.
so,
i
would
be
most
interested
in
how
you
justify
that.
unknown
speaker
do
we
have
it
in
front
of
us?
it's
not
the
one
at
61a?
unknown
speaker
this
is
61a
of
the
petition...
or
the
jurisdictional
statement.
unknown
speaker
well,
is
it
because
they're
taking
the
wrong
point
in
time
to
determine
the
incumbency
to
protect?
in
other
words,
are
you
saying
they
had
to
go
back,
say,
to
1989...
and
i
don't
know
what
the
situation
was
in
'89...
and...
and
they
might
consider
trying
to
preserve
something
close
to
the
incumbency
at
that
time,
but
they
can't
look
at
it
at
the...
at
the
most
recent
period?
unknown
speaker
but
they
are
entitled
to
say,
we're
going
to
have
six
democratic
districts,
all
six
of
which
are
democratically
constructed.
unknown
speaker
the
problem
that
i
have
and
i
think
the
problem
that
justice
o'connor
tried
to
raise
is...
is
this.
i...
i
see
the
maps
and
i...
i
don't...
i
don't
mean
by
my
question
to
discount
the
evidentiary
value
of
the
map
for
you--
unknown
speaker
--because
i
can
see
that
it
has
some.
but
the
summary
judgment
record
upon
which
you
rely
is
a
record,
in
fact,
in
which
the...
the
district
is
no
longer
majority-minority,
the
building
blocks
of
it
are
no
longer
the...
the
tiny
little
census
blocks.
they're...
i
forget
whether
they're
precincts
or
census
tracts,
but
they're...
they're
larger
units.
the
district,
as
i
understand
it,
is
at
least
consistent
with
the
goal
of
incumbency
protection,
and
you've
got
at
least
a
couple
of
affidavits
on
the
record
against
you
to
the
effect
that
that
was
the
motive.
and
the
problem
that
i
have,
even
giving...
giving
the
sort
of
evidentiary
consideration
to
your
map,
is
i
don't
see
how
on
that
record
it
could
be
found
that
you
were
entitled
to
judgment
as
a
matter
of
law
because
there
was
no
dispute
as
to
a
genuine
fact,
the
genuine
fact
being
the
predominant
motive.
that's
my
problem.
unknown
speaker
but
let's
take
one
thing
about--
--may
i
ask
you
a
question
please?
may
i
just
ask
this?
justice
souter
didn't
mention
the
thing
i
find
most
troubling
about
the
whole
case.
as
i
understand
it,
your
affirmative
case
relied
entirely
on
registration
rather
than
on
actual
voting
results.
and
if
i...
if
i
understand
the
situation
in
north
carolina
correctly,
there
are
many,
many
more
registered
democrats
who
vote
republican.
there
are
a
lot
of
registered
democrats
who
regularly
vote
republican.
and
how...
if
that
is
the
truth...
and
i
assume
you
don't
deny
that
that's
true...
how
can
evidence
about
registration
possibly
prove
that...
how
the
elections
will
turn
out?
unknown
speaker
but...
but
explain
why
the
registration
of
white
democrats
is
probative
of
how
they'll
vote.
unknown
speaker
is
it
not
true
that
there...
that
maybe
a
third
of
the
registered
democrats
vote
republican
in
federal
elections?
unknown
speaker
and
is
it
also
true...
just
i
want
to
ask
you...
that
your
case
relied
entirely
on
registration
rather
than
voting
results?
unknown
speaker
it
was
66.49
percent
and
the
other
two
were
62.8
percent
and
61.5
percent.
unknown
speaker
that's
right?
unknown
speaker
but
each
of
the
three
you
described
won
by
over
60
percent.
unknown
speaker
but
regardless
of
what
might
have
been
in
the
evidence,
as
i
read
the
district
court's
decision,
they
are
relying
exclusively
on
registered
voters.
it
comes
up
again
and
again
and
again.
and
in
fact,
the
peterson
affidavit
is
written
off
with
one
sentence,
and
we
are
given
a
whole
page
with
the
registration.
if
we
think
that's
wrong,
if
we
think
that
the
legislature
could
legitimately
use
actual
results...
i
mean,
that's
what
the
affidavits
of
the
legislators
said.
we
didn't
use
registration.
we
thought
actual
results
were
reliable.
was
that
wrong
to
use
actual
results?
unknown
speaker
but
the
question
of
the
districts
that
were
excluded
and
what
their
composition
was...
for
that
you
used,
and
the
district
court
accepted,
registration
figures
to
determine
how
democratic
they
were
and
whether
they
were
excluded
because
they
had
white
voters
but
who
were
democratic.
and
that's
what
was
criticized
by
the
legislators
who
said,
no,
you
can't
tell
that
those
white
voters
are,
in
fact,
going
to
vote
democratic.
unknown
speaker
so,
are
you
telling
us
essentially
it
doesn't
matter,
that
maybe
the
district
court
was
wrong
to
use
the
registration
instead
of
the
actual
results,
but
it
doesn't
matter,
we
should
win
anyway?
unknown
speaker
but
the
district
judge
relied...
the
district...
two
of
the
district
judges
relied
on...
on
the
registration
figures.
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
we're
not
going
to
reconstruct
the
record
and
we're
not...
another
question
was
about
looking
at
only
32
precincts
when
there
are
120
surrounding
that
might
have
given
a
different
picture.
you're
not
asking
us
to
say,
well,
if
the
district...
the
district
court
could
have
found
that
and
therefore
summary
judgment
is
appropriate
even
though
they
didn't
find
it.
unknown
speaker
mr.
everett,
can...
can
one
say
that
on
summary
judgment,
that
it's
a
post
hoc
rationalization?
you
know,
if
you're...
if
you're
sitting
as
a
finder
of
fact,
you
could
decide
that
about
an
affidavit,
but
on
a
summary
judgment
motion,
i
question
whether
you
can
characterize
it
that
way.
unknown
speaker
what
do
you
do
with
the
conclusion
of
the
state
statistician?
i
mean,
i
presume
he
was
not--
unknown
speaker
--what...
what
do
you
do
with
the
evidence
of
the
state
statistician
that
says
that
the...
the
facts
statistically
analyzed
are
just
as
consistent
with
the
incumbency
protection
as
with
the
predominant
racial
motive?
unknown
speaker
so,
do
you
think
as
a
matter
of
law
then...
i
take...
is
it
your
position
that
as
a
matter
of
law,
his
conclusion
should
be
discounted
to...
to
nothing
for
summary
judgment
purposes?
unknown
speaker
but
isn't...
isn't
that
what
we...
i
mean,
isn't
that
what
we
do
at
trials,
if
we
do
it
at
all,
is...
is...
i...
i'm...
i'm
just
having
difficulty
in
seeing
what
the
theory
is
on...
on
which
you
discount
it
to
nothing
as
a
matter
of
law
for
summary
judgment
purposes.
unknown
speaker
well,
but
this
is
not
conclusory.
this
is...
this
is
an
affidavit
that
says
either
of
two
conclusions
is
possible,
and
it's
very
relevant
at
the
summary
judgment
stage
because
the
question
is,
as
a
matter
of
law,
is...
is
only
one
conclusion
possible?
so...
so,
sure,
it's
conclusory
but
it's
a
conclusion
about
a
conclusion,
and
i
assume
that
the
expert
is
competent
to
offer
it.
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
how
about
the
statistician's
conclusion?
why
isn't
that
a
good
reason
for
saying...
not
the
only
reason,
but
a
good
reason
for
saying
that
there
certainly
may
indeed
be
a
genuine
issue
here?
unknown
speaker
so...
so,
you're
saying
his
conclusion
is
really
beside
the
point,
and
the
reason
it's
beside
the
point
is
you
can...
if
i
understand
you
correctly,
that
you
cannot
justify
by
incumbency
protection
the
preservation
of
an
incumbency
which
itself
resulted
from...
from
the
scheme
which
has
been
knocked
out
on
constitutional
grounds.
unknown
speaker
well--
--mr.
everett,
before
you
get...
i
had
thought
that
the
statistician
was
not
testifying
as
to
any
facts
to
establish
facts
that
are
controverted.
i
thought
that
he
was
just
drawing
different
conclusions
from
the
agreed-upon
facts
than
other
people.
now,
is...
is
that
enough
to
establish
the
existence
of
controverted
facts?
unknown
speaker
there's
no
doubt
that
there's
controversion
as
to
what
the
conclusions
might
be
here.
unknown
speaker
what
fact
did
the...
did
the
statistician
controvert
that
hadn't
been
controverted
before?
i
don't--
unknown
speaker
--is
racial
motivation
a
fact?
is
racial
motivation
a
fact?
unknown
speaker
well,
it's...
isn't
it
the
nub
of
what
we're...
we're
litigating
now?
unknown
speaker
and
doesn't
the
statistician's
conclusion
bear
on
that?
unknown
speaker
mr.
everett,
the
original
plan
that
this
court
looked
at
in
shaw
v.
reno
is
reflected
in
your
1992
base
plan
map.
is
that
correct?
unknown
speaker
and
the
plan
with
which
we
are
now
concerned
is
represented
by
the
'97
plan?
unknown
speaker
and...
and
how
long
are
the
terms
of
legislators
in
north
carolina?
unknown
speaker
so,
we
are
not
dealing
with
the
same
legislature
in--
unknown
speaker
--1997
plan.
it's
a
different
legislature.
unknown
speaker
but
different
people.
unknown
speaker
different
legislature.
unknown
speaker
that
gets
back
to
the...
your
original
statement.
i
think
you
were
establishing
a
hypothetical
something
like
this.
a
plan
is
invalidated
by
the
courts
as
being
based
on
a
racial
gerrymander.
race
was
the
predominant
motive
in
drawing
the
whole
district,
let's
say.
unknown
speaker
then
legislators
get
together
and
say,
you
know,
that
plan
was
really
a
pretty
good
plan
because
it
had
a
partisan
balance.
we
don't
care
about
race,
but
we
want
to
keep
it
for
a
partisan
balance.
and
you
said
something
to
the
effect,
oh,
that's
ridiculous
or
absurd
or
wrong.
why
is
that
so?
if...
if
it
is
ridiculous
or
absurd
or
wrong,
does
that
just
show
that
the
predominant
motive
test
is...
is
not
adequate?
unknown
speaker
no,
no.
this
is
a...
we're...
we're
assuming
that
the
legislators
say
their
new
motive...
and
they're
in
good
faith
about
this...
is
to
keep
partisan
balance,
so
they
just
keep
the
old
district.
is
that
permissible?
unknown
speaker
why?
unknown
speaker
but
if
what
were
driving
at
is...
is
preventing
districting
based
on
an
impermissible
motive,
how
is
that
furthered
by
your...
by
your
conclusion
here?
unknown
speaker
but
isn't
that
just
a
show
of
perhaps
a
flaw
in...
in
the
reasoning
of
our
cases,
that
you
can't
use
race
at
all
is...
i
guess
is
what
you're
saying.
unknown
speaker
what
in
your
basic
view,
to
go
back
to
basics
for
a
second,
in
your
own
mind...
what
is
it
in
the
fourteenth
amendment?
why
do
you
think
it's
somehow
basically
fair
to
gerrymander
a
district
to
have
more
democratic
faces
in
the
legislature,
but
you
couldn't
democrat
a
district...
gerrymander
a
district
because
in
part
you
were
pleased
if
there
were
more
elections
of,
say,
african-americans
who
haven't
been
overly
represented
in
the
legislature?
why,
in
other
words,
is
the
one
somehow
basically
fair
and
the
other
is
somehow
fundamentally
unfair
in
your
opinion?
unknown
speaker
suppose
race
is
just
a
surrogate
for
something
else,
mr.
everett.
suppose,
given
the
facts
that
nationwide
blacks
vote...
i
don't
know...
90...
90-some
percent
democratic,
suppose
the
legislature
just
says,
ah,
we're
not
going
to
look
at
all
these
statistics.
we're...
we're
going
to
put
all
these
blacks
into
this
one
district
because
we
think
they're
going
to
vote
democratic.
is
that
okay?
unknown
speaker
and...
and
i
suppose
it's
also
use
of
race
as
a
proxy
if
you
say,
well,
there
are
democrats
and
there
are
democrats,
but
black
democrats
are
really
strong
democrats.
so,
since
we
want
really
strong
democrats
in
this
district,
we're
going
to
put
more
black
democrats
in
this
district.
that's
also
a
proxy,
i
assume.
unknown
speaker
would
it
be
a
proxy
if
you
looked
at
those
who
had
regularly
voted
democratic
without
knowing
their
race
but
just
look
at
what
happened
in
the
ballots
and
use
that
as
a
proxy?
unknown
speaker
then
let
me
ask
you
this
question.
if
you
were
in
the
legislature
and
had
to
start
out
fresh
without
trying
to
be
bothered
by
what
happened
in
the
past,
would
you
think
it
more
appropriate
to
look
at
election
results
or
registration
as
the
best
basis
for
deciding
how
people
will
vote?
unknown
speaker
which
do
you
think
would
be
the...
which
do
you
think
would
be
the
more
reliable?
unknown
speaker
why
would
their
registration
be...
be
the
better
choice?
unknown
speaker
but
if
you're
trying
to
avoid
a
choice.
that's
what
i
was
trying
to
suggest.
if
you're
trying
to
avoid
a
choice
predicated
on
race,
would
it
not
be
better
to
look
at
election
results
rather
than
registration?
unknown
speaker
well,
if
you
were
trying
to
district
on
a
basis
of
race,
i
guess
registration...
i
guess
voting
patterns
would
be
better
then
too.
unknown
speaker
in
some...
in
some
instances
and
under
some
hypotheses.
unknown
speaker
mr.
everett,
in
terms
of
summary
judgment,
one
procedural
feature
of
this
case
is...
is
disconcerting.
that
is,
you
keep
talking
about
they
haven't
remedied
the
wrong
or...
as
though
this
were
the
original
shaw
v.
reno
case,
but
it's
not.
that
case,
for
whatever
reason,
was
dismissed.
one
of
the
things
that
was
said
was
that
the
plaintiffs
are
no
longer
in
the
district,
but
now
it
turns
up
two
of
those
very
same
people
start
a
brand-new
lawsuit.
and
in
a
brand-new
lawsuit,
usually
the
plaintiff
carries
the
burden,
and
it
is
extraordinary
to
give
summary
judgment
to
the
party
who
has
the
proof
burden.
unknown
speaker
well,
on
burden...
on
burden
of
proof,
after
a
district
has
been
invalidated
as
a
racial
gerrymander,
perhaps
the
burden
of
proof
should
shift
to
the
state
to
show
that
the
district
was
not
dominated
by
race.
unknown
speaker
was
there
a
reason
for
starting
over
when
you
had
two
plaintiffs
who
qualified
so
that
you
could
have
carried
on
the
old?
was
there
reason
for
bringing
a...
a
whole
new
lawsuit?
unknown
speaker
so,
there
are
none...
none
of
the
people
who
are
now
in
the...
in
the
plaintiffs'
lineup
from
the
12th
district
were
plaintiffs
in
shaw
v.
reno.
unknown
speaker
but
not
in
the
original.
unknown
speaker
what
is
the
status
of
the
1st
district?
that
one
didn't
go
up
on
summary
judgment.
unknown
speaker
no,
but
where...
what
is
the
posture
of
that
litigation
right
now?
unknown
speaker
thank
you,
mr.
everett.
mr.
dellinger,
you
have
about
4
minutes.
unknown
speaker
in...
in
the
hypothetical
that
we
were
working
with
where
they
keep
exactly
the
same
districts,
would
the
voters
still
have
that
same
heavy
burden
after
a
district
had
been
previously
declared
invalid?
unknown
speaker
mr....
mr.
dellinger--
unknown
speaker
--i'm
not
sure
from
your...
from
your
prior
presentation
what
your
answer
to
these
questions
are.
would...
would
you
think
it
is
okay
to
use
race
as
a
determinant
of
what
voters
are
likely
to
vote
for
the
incumbent
representative?
unknown
speaker
could
you
race
as
a
determinant
of
who
are
yellow-dog
democrats,
so-called?
unknown
speaker
those
who
will
vote
for
a
yellow
dog
that's
a
democrat.
unknown
speaker
right?
unknown
speaker
the
honorable
court
is
now
adjourned
until
monday
next
at
ten
o'clock.
unknown
speaker
the
opinions
of
the
court
in
two
cases
will
be
announced
by
justice
thomas.
