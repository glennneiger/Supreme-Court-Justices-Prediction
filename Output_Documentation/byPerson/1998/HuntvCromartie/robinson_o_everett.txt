mr.
robinson
o.
everett
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
am
back
again
with
a
map
show
and
that's
because
the
maps
are
a
very
important
part
of
the
history.
there
are
two
maps
that
we're
going
to
show--
mr.
robinson
o.
everett
--your
honor,
we...
i
think
the
maps
are
a
key
to
that.
starting
first
with
the
1992
map,
which
is
over
here,
which
is
part
of
the
history
and
which
was
part
of
the
court's
opinion
in
shaw
v.
reno--
mr.
robinson
o.
everett
--they...
this
is
the
one
i
believe
on
61a,
the
1992--
mr.
robinson
o.
everett
--jurisdictional
statement.
and
the
other
one,
the
'97
plan,
is
i
believe
on
59a.
in
any
event,
they
are
juxtaposed.
they
are
in
the
jurisdictional
statement.
and
i
think
the...
the
reason
why
there's...
why
there's
a
basis
for
summary
judgment
is
this.
this
particular
map
was
used
in
three
elections.
this
is
the
'92
map.
it
gave
a
result
in
1996
which
was
six
democratic
congressmen
and
six
republicans,
six
democratic
members,
of
whom
two
were
african-americans,
one
elected
from
the
12th
district,
the
other
from
the
1st
district,
the
other
four
were...
were
white.
then,
on
the
other
hand,
there
were
six
republicans.
now,
at
that
point,
there
was
a
balance.
it
was
perfectly
proper,
according
to
the
state's
logic,
to
simply
say,
we
are
now
going
to
reenact
this
for
political
purposes.
we
like
the
result.
it
is
a
perfect
balance.
we
have
a
legislature
in
which
the
house
is
republican,
the
senate
is
democratic,
and
we'll
just
balance
it
off.
therefore,
we
will
reenact
exactly
what
we
had
before.
now,
that
would
be
perfectly
consistent
with
their
logic
because
they
could
say
this
is
for
partisan
reasons.
there's
not
a
predominant
racial
motive.
we
like
the
results.
we
think
on
its
face
that
seems
ridiculous.
mr.
robinson
o.
everett
your
honor,
i'm
saying
they're
perfectly
free
to
say,
yes,
we
like
this
balance,
but
they're
not...
they're
not
free
to
say
we
like
this
balance
and
we're
going
to
replicate
it
by
having
six
democratic
districts
of
whom
two
will
be
racially
constructed,
and
particularly--
mr.
robinson
o.
everett
--they...
that
would
be--
mr.
robinson
o.
everett
--sure.
mr.
robinson
o.
everett
your
honor,
we...
we
would
maintain
this,
that
their
statements
as
to
predominant
motive
are
purely
legally...
legal
conclusions
in
the
present
context,
that
as
far
as
the
material
issues
of
fact,
there
are
none
that
are
in
dispute.
mr.
robinson
o.
everett
well,
your
honor,
there
a
couple
of
things
that
seem
very
important
in
that
context.
one
is
to
recall
that,
according
to
undisputed
evidence,
95
to
97
percent
of
the
african-americans
in
north
carolina
register
as
democrat
and
they
tend
to
vote
democrat.
so,
therefore,
you
start
with
that
premise.
if
you
want
a
partisan
core--
mr.
robinson
o.
everett
--well,
certainly
a
registration
indicates
a
preference.
and
one
of
the
problems--
mr.
robinson
o.
everett
--certainly,
that
is
quite
true,
your
honor.
on
the
other
hand--
mr.
robinson
o.
everett
--no,
your
honor,
that
is
not
the
fact.
it
relies
on
other
things
as
well.
it
relies
in
part
on
voting
results,
as
for
example,
there
were
three
different
races
that
they
relied
on
that
they
had
in
the
computer
base.
there
were
two
1998...
two
1988
elections,
one
for
the
court
of
appeals,
one
for
lieutenant
governor,
and
there
was
a
senate
race
in
which
an
african-american,
harvey
gantt,
ran
against
an
incumbent,
jesse
helms.
if
you
will
note
the
margin
of
victory
with
respect
to
gantt
over
helms
in
this
particular
district,
it's
significantly
above
that--
mr.
robinson
o.
everett
--it
was...
it
was
about
a--
mr.
robinson
o.
everett
--4
and
a
half
percent
in
one
instance
and
a--
mr.
robinson
o.
everett
--each...
that's
correct,
your
honor.
but
on
the
other
hand,
there
was
a
spread.
mr.
robinson
o.
everett
it
certainly
was
permissible
to
look
at
the
actual
results.
the
actual
results
we
think
corroborate
the
point
that
we
make,
that
it
were
racially...
it
was
racially
based.
but
the
significant
thing,
your
honor,
is
the
way
in
which
this
is
constructed.
it
winds
up
with
two
large
concentrations
of
african-americans
in
the
triad
area...
that's
greensboro,
high
point,
winston-salem,
approximately
110,000...
and
another
concentration
in
mecklenburg
county,
110,000.
this
is
the
partisan
core.
90
percent
of
the
african-americans
who
are
in
the
district,
as
it
was
reconstituted,
had
been
in
the
old
12th
district.
the...
the
manner
of
structure
was
such
as
to
keep
a
partisan
core.
mr.
robinson
o.
everett
well,
the
thing
that
was
significant
was
that
they
wanted
to
put
the
african-american
voters
there
because
they
could
tell
that
would
be
a
firm
partisan
core.
they
also
in
the...
the
section
5
submission
pointed
out
the
possible
effect
on
congressman
watt
of
removing
african-americans
from
the
district.
they
made
it
perfectly
clear
there
they
were
concerned
with
him
not
only
as
an
incumbent
democrat,
but
as
an
incumbent
african-american
democrat.
so,
all
of
that
goes
into
the...
into
the--
mr.
robinson
o.
everett
--i
would
say
in
this
particular
instance
it
doesn't
matter,
that
you--
mr.
robinson
o.
everett
--but
in
addition,
the
actual
result
figures
point
out
the
same
thing.
for
example,
if
you
look
at
guilford
county,
you'll
find
districts
which
were
excluded
which
gave
victories
to
the
democrats,
but
they
were
predominantly
white.
mr.
dellinger...
general
dellinger
points
to
elm
street--
mr.
robinson
o.
everett
--what
i'm
asking
you
to
find,
your
honor,
is
this,
that
these
judges,
who
were
very
familiar
with
the
situation,
particularly
judge
voorhees
who
had
been
on
the
shaw
panel,
looked
at
this
evidence,
considered
it
in
the
context,
and
realized
there
was
nothing
in
the
post
hoc
affidavits
of
the
legislators...
of
cooper
and
mcmahan.
they
were
not
felons,
but
they
were
giving
ex
post
facto
rationalizations,
designed
cleverly
to...
to
cover
the...
the
true
motive,
the
predominant
motive.
now--
mr.
robinson
o.
everett
--well,
your
honor,
we...
we
would...
we
point
out
in
our
brief
that
there
are
some
decisions
of
this
court
which
would
certainly
suggest
that
post
hoc
affidavits
by
legislators
are
not
competent
to
show
what
the
intent
was
at
the
time.
we
think
in
this
instance
they
actually
confirm
that
which
we
have
suggested,
as
for
example,
there's
a
portion
of
senator
cooper's
affidavit
which
makes
it
clear
they
were
concerned
about...
and
this
is
specifically
in
there...
concerned
about
whether
the
removal
of
some
of
the
african-american
voters,
particularly
those
in
durham
and
that
area,
and
gastonia,
from
the
district
would
place
him
at
a
disadvantage
because
of
race.
and
therefore,
they
make
it
clear
that
they
have
concentrations
of
voters
in
charlotte,
winston-salem,
and
greensboro.
now,
those
concentrations
of
voters,
if
you
look
at
the
statistics,
are
overwhelmingly
african-american.
so,
the...
they
use
code
in
that
situation.
they
say
democratic.
democratic.
but
these
are
particular
democrats.
they
are
democrats
who
are
democrats
who
are
african-americans.
mr.
robinson
o.
everett
i'm
sorry,
your
honor.
mr.
robinson
o.
everett
well,
it's
a
little
hard
for
me,
your
honor,
to
see
how
incumbent
protection
of
someone
who
has
been
elected
pursuant
to
a
race-skewed,
race-based
plan
is
permissible
in
this
particular
context.
i
recall--
mr.
robinson
o.
everett
--i
think...
i
think
basically
that
it
could
be
discounted.
i
think
in
a
situation
where
there's
a
reliance--
mr.
robinson
o.
everett
--well,
your
honor,
my
impression
is
that
when
affidavits
are
conclusory
and
do
not
bear
on--
mr.
robinson
o.
everett
--well,
the...
what
you
have
here
is
a
situation
where
the
legislators
are
saying
that,
yes,
we
had
this
desire
to
create
six
and
six.
that
doesn't
bear
on
whether
in
this
particular--
mr.
robinson
o.
everett
--well,
the...
the
use
of
that
which
was
impermissible,
used
as
a
base...
as
a
benchmark
of
a
plan
which
was
determined
to
be
unconstitutional,
creates
a
situation
where
reliance
on
that...
on
that
plan,
even
an
indirect
reliance
as
here--
mr.
robinson
o.
everett
--i...
i
am
saying
that
you
can't
justify
by
use,
continuing
use,
of
a
plan
that's...
which
is
race-based.
now,
19--
mr.
robinson
o.
everett
--no,
your
honor.
mr.
robinson
o.
everett
no,
your
honor.
we--
mr.
robinson
o.
everett
--we
are
unaware
of
any,
your
honor.
as
a
matter,
all
of
the
data
was
furnished
by
the
state.
mr.
robinson
o.
everett
racial
motivation
was
a
fact
originally.
it's...
it's
very
apparent
in
this
particular--
mr.
robinson
o.
everett
--well--
mr.
robinson
o.
everett
--well,
the
racial
motivation
is
apparent
from
all
the
circumstances
here.
there's
nothing
that
undercuts
that.
mr.
robinson
o.
everett
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
robinson
o.
everett
yes,
your
honor.
that...
this--
mr.
robinson
o.
everett
--well,
the
legislative
term
is
a
2-year
term.
mr.
robinson
o.
everett
you're
dealing
with
a
different
legislature,
but
they're--
mr.
robinson
o.
everett
--they're
acting
with
the
same
advice
from
the
attorney
general's
office.
mr.
robinson
o.
everett
there
are
some--
mr.
robinson
o.
everett
--some
different
people.
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
robinson
o.
everett
correct.
mr.
robinson
o.
everett
well,
we
would
say
that
where
you're
dealing
with
something
which
is
remedial,
there's
a
special
consideration
of
showing
that
the
original
predominant
motive
has
been
eliminated.
mr.
robinson
o.
everett
we
think
that
is
not
permissible.
mr.
robinson
o.
everett
we
believe
that
in
that
situation
it
is
tainted
by
the
past,
that
it
still
carries
forward
the
message.
if
you
say--
mr.
robinson
o.
everett
--well,
in
a
situation
where
the
boundaries
are
so
similar
to
those
of
a
clearly
unconstitutional
plan,
even
though
it's
no
longer
majority-minority,
we
would
submit
to
the
court
that
the
same
message
is
being
conveyed
that
was
found
impermissible
in
shaw
v.
reno.
indeed,
it
is
almost
a
reinforcement
of
that
message
to
say,
well,
they've
done
virtually
the
same
thing,
or
even
in
your
hypothetical,
your
honor,
done
the
same
thing.
mr.
robinson
o.
everett
we're
saying
that
you
cannot
use
race
to
the
extent
where
it
is
clearly
determinative,
where
as,
for
example,
in
shaw
v.
reno
there
is
a
reference
to...
to
persons
in
disparate
areas
who
are
placed
in
the
same
district
because
of
the
stereotype
of
race.
clearly
that
stereotype
governed
in
the
composition
of
these...
of
this
particular--
mr.
robinson
o.
everett
--well,
we
think,
again,
it's
a
matter
of
the
purpose,
that
if
it
is
done
to...
if
it's
targeted
to
elect
an
african-american
as
such,
whether
democrat
or
republican,
that
is
a
violation
of
the
fourteenth
amendment--
mr.
robinson
o.
everett
--we
would
say
no,
your
honor.
we'd
say
that
is
the
use
of
race
as
a
proxy.
we'd
say
that--
mr.
robinson
o.
everett
--that
would
be
a
proxy
and
that
is
again
a
use
of
racial
statistics.
mr.
robinson
o.
everett
if
that
were
a
starting
point,
your
honor,
without
any
prior
history,
where
it
was
not
a
treatment
of
race
as
a
proxy,
where
a
voter
was
not
just
a
statistic
because
of
race.
mr.
robinson
o.
everett
well,
i
think
it
would
be...
either
would
be
very
helpful.
mr.
robinson
o.
everett
i
think
in
a
situation
where
it
was...
in
north
carolina
i
think
the...
the
registration
insofar
as
it
revealed
race
would
be
the
more
important.
the
voting
results
would
be
more
important
in
other
contexts.
but--
mr.
robinson
o.
everett
--the...
why
would
the...
in
that
particular
instance,
where
it
is
identified
and
you're
knowing
whom
you
are
targeting
on
the
grounds
of
race,
that
would
be
a
better
choice
if
you
were
trying
to
get
a
particular
result
predicated
on
race,
which
in--
mr.
robinson
o.
everett
--if
you
were
trying...
if
you
were
totally
trying
to
avoid
any...
any
use
of
race,
certainly
you
could
say
i
will
forget
all
about
it.
you
will
do
as
was--
mr.
robinson
o.
everett
--well,
what
they...
what
they
did
here--
mr.
robinson
o.
everett
--right.
what
they
did
here
in
some
of
these
instances,
they
took
the
racial
hypothesis
and
verified
it
from
the
results
where
the
districts
were
voting
in
a
certain
way.
but
on
the
other
hand,
in
some
of
the
instances,
even
though
the
results
would
have
been
favorable,
they
did
not
include
them,
so
that
you
have
a...
you
have
a
clear
use
of
race
as
such
in
this
particular
district.
and
it
is
a
carryover.
it's
a
pretty
clear
carryover.
it's
a
carryover
that
was
predicated
on
a
misunderstanding
that's
reflected
in
one
of
the
comments
by
senator
cooper
on
the
floor
to
the
effect,
guess
what,
this
is
no
longer
a
majority-minority
district.
therefore,
it's
our
opinion...
we've
been
informed...
that
shape
is
not
important.
in
effect,
we've
got
a
magna
carta
to
do
whatever
we
want
to
so
long
as
it
is
not
a
majority-minority
district.
and
i
think
the...
neither
the
state
appellants
nor
the...
the
solicitor
general
at
this
point
have
argued
for
any
position
of
that
sort.
we
think
it's
clearly
wrong.
mr.
robinson
o.
everett
well,
in
a
situation
like
this,
your
honor,
where
the
statistics
are
forthcoming
from
the
state
itself...
there's
no
controversy
about
it...
we
would
say
that
the
granting
of
a
summary
judgment
was
entirely
appropriate.
there's
no
new
evidence--
mr.
robinson
o.
everett
--we
have
argued
that.
we've
argued
that
the...
that
the
burden
of
proof
should
be
on
the
state
to
show
that.
we've
argued
also
that
a
sort
of
litmus
test
would
be
the
adoption
of
some
of
the
traditional
districting
principles
to
show
there
had
been
a...
a
departure
from...
from
that
which
preceded
it.
so,
we
think
a
remedial
district
like
this,
regardless
of
who
the
parties
are,
is
still
subject
to
some
special
responsibility
on
the
state's
part
with
respect
to
showing
the...
the
vestiges
of
the
past
no
longer
exist.
so,
we
think
there
is
a
continuation
of
motive--
mr.
robinson
o.
everett
--well,
your
honor,
there
was
a
suit
that
they
had
filed.
they
were
added
as
additional
plaintiffs.
they
were
from
the
1st
district.
none
of
the
parties
in
the
12th
district,
which
had
been
declared
unconstitutional,
had
any
standing
at
that
point.
so,
there
had
to
be
some
additional
action,
and
that
was
handled
by
an
amendment
which
added
some
additional
1st
district
plaintiffs
and
also
brought
in
persons
from
the
reconstituted
12th
district.
mr.
robinson
o.
everett
there
are
two
that
were
amended
plaintiffs.
they
were
in
at
the
time
of
the...
after
the--
mr.
robinson
o.
everett
--not
in
the
original.
those
were
five
people
from
durham,
and
none
of
them
had
any
standing
after
the...
after
the
redrafting
of
the
districts.
mr.
robinson
o.
everett
that
one
didn't
go
up.
we
would
maintain
the
defendants
were
fortunate
in
that
regard
because
it
seemed
it
was
pretty
clearly
a
racial
purpose.
but
in
that
one,
there
would
have
been
issues,
to
be
sure,
of
strict
scrutiny
which
we
would
maintain
are
not
involved--
mr.
robinson
o.
everett
--the
posture
of
that
litigation
is
that
it's
in
a
holding
pattern
awaiting
the
disposition
of
this
case.
interestingly
enough,
if
in
this
case
the
decision
of
the
court
is
to
overturn
the
lower
court,
this
plan
will
then
supersede
the
plan
that
was
used
for
the
elections
in
1998.
there's
a
plan
under
which
members
of
congress
have
been
elected
and
which
is,
incidentally,
substantially
less
race-based
than
this.
we
would
still
contend
not
free
of
the
taint,
but
it's
about
35
percent
instead
of
45
percent
or
47
percent.
and
there
again,
the
partisan
results
of
maintaining
incumbency
and
so
forth
were
maintained,
which
is
a
pretty
good
indication
that
there
were
alternatives
available
to
the
state
which
they
didn't
use,
that
instead,
as
exhibited
by
their
own...
the
submission
under
section
5,
by
portions
of
the
affidavits
when
strictly...
when
properly
construed,
they
had
a
racial
motive.
they
were
concerned
that
because
of
the
removal
of
the
african-americans
in
durham
and
gastonia
from
congressman
watt's
district,
there
would
be
a
problem.
and
so
they
tried
to
assure
that
this
would
be
racially
of
a
sort
that
would
assure
his
reelection,
which
of
course
occurred
under
the
1998
plan,
but...
even
a
less
race-based
plan.
but
there
was
a
specific
purpose
which
is
revealed
even
in
the
affidavit
of...
of
senator
cooper--
so,
they
had
a
purpose
and
they
had
a
purpose
which
is
reflected
in
their
own
documents
and
it's
reflected
throughout.
and
it's
reflected
in
results.
it's
reflected
in
the
circumstances
that
the
experienced
judges
sitting
there
in
charlotte,
or
sitting
in
north
carolina,
that
they
found
and
looked
at.
they
understood
quite
well
that
even
though
there
was
a
recital
of
a...
of
maintaining
a
partisan
balance,
a
recital
of
racial
fairness,
that
as
far
as
the
12th
district
was
concerned,
there
was
a
target,
and
that
was
to
assure
that
there
would
be
an
african-american
reelected
and
stated
in
terms
of
reelecting
an
incumbent.
but
in
this
particular
instance,
we
would
say
that
it
was
significant
that
that
incumbent
was
an
african-american.
now,
it's
perfectly
fine
to
have
him
reelected,
but
our
contention
is
that
it
should
be
done
from
districts
which
are
not
predicated
primarily
on
race,
where
race
is
not
the
predominant
motive.
and
we
would
suggest,
your
honors,
that
if
you
look
at
these
two
maps
together,
you
come
only
to
the
conclusion
that
there
is
such
a
violation
of
the
ordinary
precepts
of
traditional
districting
that
this
has
to
be
viewed
as
based
on
race.
and
that
is
unconstitutional.
mr.
robinson
o.
everett
no.
mr.
robinson
o.
everett
race
can
not
only
be
used
not
only
for
its
own
sake,
but
as
this
court
has
taught,
it
shouldn't
be
used
as
a
proxy
or
a
surrogate
for
other
things.
i'm
quite
clear
on
that.
this
is
a
case
where
we
used
the
thing
itself,
and
it's
really
turning
washington
against
davis
upside
down
to
say
that
because
the
thing
itself,
political
affiliation,
happens
to
correlate,
that
now
we
have
to
treat
it
as
if
it
were
suspect.
it
was
stated
most
precisely
i
think
in...
in
an
opinion
by
justice
o'connor
that
you
joined
in...
in
hernandez
where
two
hispanics
were
struck
from
a
jury
because
of
their
difficulty
relying
on
the
translation.
and
the
court
said
that
was
appropriate.
and...
and
the
strongest
statement
was
in
the
concurring
opinion
that
said,
no
matter
how
closely
tied
or
significantly
correlated
to
race
the
explanation
may
be,
the
strike
does
not
implicate
the
equal
protection
clause
unless
it
is
based
on
race.
that
is
the
distinction
between
disproportionate
effect
and
intentional
discrimination.
that
is
the
heart
of
our
jurisprudence
which
we
turned
upside
down.
i
don't
think
the
state
can
be
forever
barred
from
putting
a
democratic
district
in
the
piedmont
crescent
that
makes
as
much
sense
as
this
one
does
as
if
it
were
some
convicted
felon
or...
or
bungling
constable
that
had
to
be
held
under
scrutiny.
the
'98
plan
may
look
better,
but
i
would
just
close
by
saying
it's
significantly
less
desirable
from
legitimate
political
purposes.
it
includes
an
entire
rural
county
and
takes
out
greensboro,
which
has
much
more
in
common
with
the
banking
and
commercial
and
urban
centers.
thank
you.
