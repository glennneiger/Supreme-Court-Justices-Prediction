mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
when
the
north
carolina
general
assembly
enacted
its
1997
congressional
districting
plan,
compliance
with
this
court's
decision
in
shaw
v.
hunt
was
its
number
one
goal.
it
met
that
goal.
the
line-drawing
decisions
contested
here
were
not
driven
predominantly
by
race
either
for
its
own
sake
or
as
a
proxy,
but
they
were
made
on
the
basis
of
actual
election
data.
they
were
designed
to
accomplish
the
constitutionally
legitimate
goal
of
maintaining
partisan
balance
in
the
state's
congressional
delegation.
we
had
a
republican-led
house
and
a
democratic
senate
who
determined
not
to
gridlock
and
leave
this
vital
function
to
federal
courts.
they
came
together
on
a
bipartisan,
bicameral
agreement
that
retained
six
districts
leaning
to
each
party,
a
goal
that
was
accomplished
by
having
a
democratic-leaning
district
created
in
the
midst
of
the
republican
sea
that
is
the
piedmont
carolina.
let
me
put
on
the
table
a
half
dozen
ways
this
plan
differs
from
those
that
this
court
invalidated
in
miller
and
shaw
and
bush
v.
vera.
this
plan
was
not
adopted
under
federal
pressure
for
maximization
of
black
districts.
it
was
not
adopted
by
a
process
that
manipulated
district
lines
to
exploit
unprecedentedly
detailed
racial
data.
there
was
no
use
of
computer
programs
more
sophisticated
with
respect
to
race
than
to
other
democratic
districts'
precincts.
existing
political
units
that
are
about
a
hundred
times
larger
than
the...
than
the
racially
encoded
census
blocks
used
in
texas,
precincts
with
the
building
blocks
of
the
districts
in
this
plan...
they
were
not
adopted
for
the
express
purpose
of
creating
a
majority-minority
district.
they
did
not,
in
fact,
create
a
majority-minority
district.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
i
take
it,
justice
kennedy,
that
is
the...
the
heart
of
the
case,
that
there
is
this...
this
overlap,
and
so
given
the
fact
that
this...
that
the
precincts
included
in
district
12
are
more
democratic
and
that
there
is
a
correlation...
it's
more
african-americans
adhere
to
the
democratic
party
and
registration
at
the
present
time...
that
one
could
have
done
that
as
a
pretext.
but
i
believe
and
i
think
that
mr.
everett
would
concur
that
there's
simply
no
evidence
that
that
was
the
case.
i
mean,
i
think
what
you
have
here
is
the
precise
question
that
the
court
answered
in
bush
v.
vera.
in
the
plurality
opinion
by
justice
o'connor,
the
court
said
that
if
a
state's
goal
is
the
otherwise
constitutional
political
gerrymandering,
it
is
free
to
use
precinct
general
elections,
voting
patterns,
precinct
primary
voting
patterns
to
achieve
that
goal
regardless
of
its
awareness
of
its
racial
implication
and
that
if
district
lines
merely
correlate
with
race,
because
they're
drawn
on
the
basis
of
political
affiliation
which
correlates
with
race,
there
is
no
racial
classification
to
justify.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
well,
you
make--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--well,
to
be
precise,
justice
kennedy's
question
was
whether
there
was
any
evidence
that
they...
that
they
made
a
pretextual
use
of
creating
a
democratic
district,
of
using
democratic
precincts
in
order
to
create
a
district
that
was
more
african-american.
and
one
could
imagine
counter-examples.
first
of
all,
the
state
has
direct
evidence
of
the...
senator
cooper
and
representative
mcmahan
that...
that
partisan
election
results
were
what...
were
the
building
blocks
for
the
creation
of
this
district.
that
was
their
predominant
concern.
the
examples
that
are
given
that
there
are
democratic
registration
precincts
adjacent
to
but
outside
district
12,
representative
watt's
district,
is
virtually
a
non
sequitur
because
there's
a
very
simple
answer.
the
precincts
that
adjoin
district
12
that
are
not
included
aren't
less
democratic
by
any
measure
than
the
included
precincts.
89
percent
of
the
precincts
outside
the
boundary
but
adjacent
to,
that
have
a
majority
democratic
registration
actually
voted
republican
on
election
day
in
either
one
or
two
or
all
three
of
the
elections
that
the
legislature
has
been
consulting
this
decade
in
doing
districting.
you
have
to
understand
that
north
carolina
is
basically
democratic
in
registration.
there's
not
a
single
one
of
the
12
congressional
districts
that
has
a
majority
of
registered
republicans.
so
their
only
suggestion
is,
but
the
state
had
some
districts
outside
district
12
that
were
majority
democratic,
to
which
our
answer
is,
they
were
not
excluded.
we
were
already
at
the
equal
population
limit
with
this
district,
and
they
were
less
democratic
either
in
terms
of
voting
registration.
there
are
in
the
entire
12th
district
only
2
precincts...
they're
both
in
guilford
county;
they're
noted
in
red
on
one
of
the
maps...
only
2
precincts
that
are
inside
the
district
that
have
a
democratic
registration
that
is
less
than
one
or
more
of
the
neighboring
precincts
outside
the
district.
and
in
that
case,
if
the
court...
the
legislature
followed
the
basic
township
line,
elm
street,
then
lee
street
that
has
traditionally
divided
greensboro.
so
that
i...
i
think
what
the
question
leads
to
in
terms
of
the
incumbency,
i
don't
think
you
can
have
a
bill
of
attainder
that...
that
congressmen
want,
the
interest
in
preserving
someone
of
rising
seniority
may
never
be
a...
may
never
be
at
interest
because
of
what
this
court
held
about
the
original
plan.
the
state
gains
a
great
deal
by
having
from
charlotte
a
member
of
each
political
party,
each
of
whom
is
rising
in
influence
within
their
respective
political
districts.
this
is
not...
the
chain
of
causation
from
the
prior
district
i
think
is
broken
in
a
number
of
ways.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
sure.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
well,
we're
making
two
points.
one,
we
believe
that
it
is
obvious
that
the
court
below
erred
in
granting--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--in
granting
summary
judgment.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
well,
we
would
hope
that
the
court,
having
before
it
the
permanent
injunction
against
the
legislature's
'97
plan,
would
clearly
indicate
that
the
state
on
facts
like
these
was
entitled
to
prevail,
it's
entitled
to
summary
judgment,
because
what
the
state
puts
on
is
both
direct
and
supporting
evidence
demonstrating
that
the
shape
of
the
district
reflected
a--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--yes.
the
state
moved
for
summary
judgment
and
it
was
denied.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
no.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
i
understand
that--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--in
the
course...
it
would
not
be
beyond
the
course
of
an
opinion
of
the
court
holding
that
the
district
court
was,
of
course,
wrong
in
granting
summary
judgment
against
the
direct
evidence
of
the...
of
the
state
that
politics
was
used,
to
make
it
clear
to
the
district
court
that
the
state's
explanation,
both
direct
and
supported,
that
it
created
a
democratic
leading
district
in
a
sea
of
republicans,
and
that
that
is
a
fully
explanatory
answer
and
which
was
contradicted--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--no,
you
can't
assume
that,
but...
but...
but
i
think
the
state
would
be...
the
state
would
feel
vindicated
if
it
were
known
that
on
this
kind
of
record
where
there
are
really
just
three
things
that
were
said
to
impeach
the
state's
direct
case.
one
was
the
shape
of
the
district,
to
which
i
will
come.
the
other
is
that
the...
that
there
are
some
democrats
outside
the
district
in
precincts
that
are
less
democratic
that...
that
are
not
included.
and
the
third
is
basically
a
racial
imbalance
argument,
that
if
you
look
at
the
districts,
the
heavily
republican...
southeastern
mecklenburg
and
otherwise
heavily
republican
district
of
representative
sue
myrick
as
more
proportionate
whites
than
the
heavily
democratic
leading
district
of...
of...
of
congressman
watt,
that
is
evidence
only
that
it
does
not
in
any
way
contradict
the
state's
assertion
that
it
was
the
desire
to...
and
the
difficulty
of
creating
a
political
district.
what
you
have
here
is
the
complete
absence
of
counter-examples.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
i...
i
understand--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--that
the...
the...
what
the
state
is...
wishes
to
establish
is
that
the
preliminary
injunction...
the
permanent
injunction
was
in
error.
they
clearly
did
not
make
their
case
for
summary
judgment.
but
moreover--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--i
do
not
believe
that
the
state...
i
am
not
aware...
we
haven't
thought
through
to
that
point,
justice
ginsburg.
but
i'm
not
aware
that
the
state
has
or
indeed
would
need
any
other
information.
the...
the
challengers
have
appropriately
a
very
heavy
burden
under
this
court's
decisions
in
miller
and
others,
and
here
the
state
puts
on
the
only
evidence
it
has,
that...
that--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--that
it
needs
to
put
on.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
i
think
that's
right.
i
don't--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--well,
it
would
be
interesting
to
me
to
know
what
other
evidence
they
could
have.
you
have--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--that's
right.
you
have
the
statement,
and
i
think
the
court--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--well,
anyway,
we
have
both
direct
and
circumstantial
evidence.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
no,
i
certainly
wouldn't
think
so.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
i
believe
the
record
doesn't
need--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--yes.
now,
unlike
the
hypothetical
you
gave,
neither
representative
mcmahan
or
senator
cooper
is
a
convicted
felon,
not
even--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--i
understand
that.
[laughter]
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--someone
who
is
a
10-times
convicted
felon.
representative
mcmahan
said
under
oath
in
a
sworn
statement
that
in
negotiating
the
eventually
enacted
plan,
partisan
election
data,
not
race,
was
the
predominant
basis.
and
indeed,
that...
there's
no
reason
to
go
beyond
that.
the
court
understood
in
bush
v.
vera
that
if
you're
going
to
create
a
democratic
district...
and
here
the...
to
get
a
partisan
balance,
you
need
a
democratic
district
in
this
part
of
the
carolinas.
and
to
anticipate
the
map
show
that
my
colleague
will
put
on,
what
you
will
see
is
i
think
a...
a
very
sensible
district,
by
no
means
inexplicably
bizarre.
it
is
the
third
shortest
district
of
the
12
in
north
carolina,
and
it's
thin
only
because
it's
a
densely
populated
area.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
we...
we
do
not.
it
is
not,
as
judge
ervin
said
below,
justice
kennedy,
a
dispositive
factor,
but
it
certainly
makes
the
plaintiffs'
burden,
which
was
already
quite
high,
even
more
onerous
to
prove,
justice
kennedy.
and--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--right.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
it...
it--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--it
is
circumstantial
evidence
in
the
sense
that
it
doesn't
communicate
the
message
that
this
is
a
district
whose
representative
is
supposed
to
only
care
about
the
interest
of
one
racial
group.
i'll
reserve
my
time
to
discuss
judge
everett's
maps.
thank
you.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
justice
scalia
said
in
the
first
argument
this
morning
that
the
court
has
a
responsibility
not
just
to
look
at
the
particular
case
but
to
look
to
the
future,
and
what
we're
most
concerned
with
when
you
do
that
is
to
think
how
important
it
is
to
make
clear
that
there's
a
heavy
burden
on
those
who
would
challenge
a
state
legislature
in
the
exercise
of
one
of
its
most
sovereign
functions
of...
of
state
self-definition
as
a
political
entity.
here--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--i
think
that
the...
that
the
same
district
would
mean
that
you
had
not,
nearly
to
this
extent,
eradicated
the
message
harms
of
the...
of
the
1st
district,
justice
kennedy.
the
changed
process
might
make
a
difference.
but
here,
if
you
look
at
this
map,
what
is
clear
is
that
three-fifths
of
the
district
is
different.
the
lint
is
reduced
in
half.
the
whole
hundred-mile
corridor
to
pick
up
durham
is
gone.
there's
only
one
split
precinct,
no
use
of
crossovers,
double
crossovers,
continuity.
it
is
a
democratic
district
that...
that
makes
sense,
and
its
stated
purpose
was
to
do
so.
this
is--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--yes.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
no.
we
do
not
believe
that
race--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--no.
