mr.
jonathan
e.
nuechtherlein
the
grammatical
structure
of
article
17
is
very
similar
in
the
french
as
in
the
english.
i
think
justice
stevens'
question
turns
on
the
interpretation
of
the
introductory
clause
of
article
24
which,
as
justice
ginsburg
points
out,
is
the
focus
of
the
exclusivity
analysis
here.
and
justice
stevens
was
concerned
that
because
the
language
in
the
cases
covered
by
article
17
doesn't
explicitly
say
in
all
personal
injury
cases,
the
convention
is
not
exclusive
as
to
some.
mr.
jonathan
e.
nuechtherlein
as
an
initial
matter,
i
should
point
out
the
house
of
lords
also
thought
that
that
was
in
fact
the
appropriate
language
to
focus
on
in...
in
this
circumstance
and
determined,
as
we
believe
is
correct,
that
the
framers
of
the
convention
intended
that
introductory
clause
as
a
shorthand
to
denote
the
class
of
personal
injury
cases
generally
as
opposed
to
the
class
of
cases
involving
damages--
mr.
jonathan
e.
nuechtherlein
--for
article
24.
but
i
think
the
more
important
point--
mr.
jonathan
e.
nuechtherlein
--i
think
the
introductory
clause
of
article
24,
even
in
its
original
form,
was
a
shorthand
denoting
all
personal
injury
cases.
but
from
the
government's
perspective,
the
more
important
point
is
this.
last
week
the
united
states
ratified
montreal
protocol
no.
4.
mr.
jonathan
e.
nuechtherlein
that
means
in
the
class
of
cases
to
which
article
17
is
addressed,
which
is
personal
injury
cases.
mr.
jonathan
e.
nuechtherlein
exactly.
mr.
jonathan
e.
nuechtherlein
the
premise
of
this
is
that
if
the...
if
a
passenger
cannot
satisfy
the
conditions
of
liability
under
article
17,
that
passenger
should
not,
for
that
very
reason
alone,
be
able
to
disqualify
the
carrier
from
invoking
the
limits
of
the...
of
the
convention.
mr.
jonathan
e.
nuechtherlein
well--
mr.
jonathan
e.
nuechtherlein
--again,
i
think
it's
very
relevant
that
in
montreal
protocol
no.
4,
smart
people
from
a
lot
of
countries
got
together
and
decided
to
clarify
the
language
that
is
in
article
24.
as
amended
by
montreal
protocol
no.
4,
which
is
about
to
go
into
effect
in
the
united
states,
the
introductory
clause
that
we've
all
been
focusing
on
in
article
24
no
longer
says,
in
the
cases
covered
by
article
17.
it
now
says,
in
the...
in
the
carriage
of
passengers
and
baggage.
mr.
jonathan
e.
nuechtherlein
well,
the...
there...
there
is
no
indication
in
the
proceedings
that
led
up
to
the
change
in
language
that
anyone
contemplated
that
this
would
make
any
difference
in
the
exclusivity
analysis.
and
as
we
point
out,
even
under
the
original
language
of
article
24,
the
house
of
lords
was
correct
in
interpreting
the
introductory
clause
as
meaning
precisely
what...
the
significance
that
we
give
it,
which
is
that
in
personal
injury
cases,
if
you
cannot
satisfy
the
important
conditions
for
liability
set
out
in
article
17,
then
you
may
not
use
your
very
failure
to
satisfy
those
conditions
as
a
basis
for
seeking
unlimited
liability
under
local
law
without
regard
to
the
convention.
mr.
jonathan
e.
nuechtherlein
under
the
convention
there
is
not
a
fault
requirement.
mr.
jonathan
e.
nuechtherlein
if
there
was
an
accident,
and
that
is
also
an
important
requirement.
in
saks,
this
point...
this
court
pointed
out
that
the
framers
of
the
convention
deemed
it
essential
to
confine
the
class
of
cases
in
which
passengers
can
recover
for
injuries
incurred
within
the
scope
of
the
convention
to
cases
in
which
there
was
an...
there
was
an
unexpected
or
unusual
event
that
was
external
to
the
passenger.
the
framers
did
not
want
to
create
a
liability
for
cases
where,
for
example,
someone
has
a
peculiar
medical
reaction
to
the
ordinary
circumstances
of
air
travel.
under
the
court
of
appeals'
reading
of
this
convention,
it
is
precisely
a
passenger's
failure
to
satisfy
that
important
threshold
requirement
for
recovery
under
the
convention
that
entitles
the
passenger
to
escape
the
convention
scheme
of
limited
liability
and
sue
for
potentially
unlimited
liability
under
local
law
without
regards
to
the
convention.
in
our
view,
that
would
be
very
anomalous.
the...
the
court
of
appeals'
reasoning
would
also
appear
to
apply
in
cases
where
a
passenger
suffered
purely
psychological
injuries
as
opposed
to
physical
injuries.
again,
in
floyd,
this
court
determined
that
the
framers
of
the
convention
meant
to...
to
withhold
liability
in
cases
where
a
passenger
could
claim
only
psychological
injury.
to
hold,
as
the
court
of
appeals
did,
that
a
failure
to
satisfy
article
17's
liability
conditions
takes
you
outside
the
scope
of
the
convention
creates
the
following
anomaly.
it
would
mean
that
if
you
were
a
passenger
on
an
airplane
who
was
merely
traumatized
when
the
airplane
drops
suddenly
2,000
feet
in
altitude,
you
could
sue
potentially
for
unlimited
liability
without
regard
to
the
convention.
whereas,
another
passenger
on
the
same
airplane
could...
if
that
passenger
also
bumped
her
head,
in
addition
to
being
traumatized,
would
be
confined
by...
by
the
convention's
liability
caps,
and
that
result
we
suggest
would
make
very
little
sense.
mr.
jonathan
e.
nuechtherlein
well,
the
treaty
as
a
whole
is
reproduced
in
the
united
states
code,
and
petitioner
has
reproduced
the
most
important
provisions--
mr.
jonathan
e.
nuechtherlein
--i--
mr.
jonathan
e.
nuechtherlein
--to
begin
with,
justice
breyer,
i
do
not
think
the
house
of
lords
viewed
the
text
as
going
the
other
way.
i
think
the
house
of
lords
viewed
that
particular
phrase
as
ambiguous,
and
that
ambiguity
we
would
point
out
is
resolved,
at
least
prospectively,
by
montreal
protocol
no.
4,
which
again
i
believe
establishes
the
sense
of
the
international
community
as
to
what
the
original
language
meant.
the
framers--
mr.
jonathan
e.
nuechtherlein
--i
think
the
house
of
lords
recognized
that
it
would,
in
fact,
be
anomalous
to
allow
passengers
to
disqualify
carriers
from
invoking
the--
mr.
jonathan
e.
nuechtherlein
--yes.
mr.
jonathan
e.
nuechtherlein
and
i
think
the
house
of
lords
also
recognized
that
that
language
was
not
dispositive
because
it
was
ambiguous
and
you
do,
in
fact,
need
to
look
at
the
drafting
history
and
the
convention
as
a
whole.
but
i
do
not
think
the
house
of
lords
viewed
that
language
as
pointing
in
the
opposite
direction--
mr.
jonathan
e.
nuechtherlein
--to
my
knowledge,
abnett
is
the
only
decision
of
the
highest
court
of
a
sister
signatory.
mr.
jonathan
e.
nuechtherlein
i
do
not
think
that
the
convention
read
as
a
whole
is
ambiguous.
i
think
the
introductory
clause
of
article
24,
which
was
amended
by
montreal
protocol
no.
4
to
reveal
its
original
intent,
could
be
construed
as
ambiguous.
