justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
mean
in
lockerbie
they
were
found
to
have
willfully
defaulted
in
taking
security
measures?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
they
said
we...
we
want
no
security.
we
want
the
risk
of
bombs.
i
mean,
is
that
the
sort
of
finding
that
had
to
be
made?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
they
were
doing
nothing
for
their
$5,
in
effect.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
do
you
have
any...
i
couldn't
find
anywhere...
i'll
get
it,
but
i
haven't
read
it
yet.
the
house
of
lords
says
that
if
you
look
at
the
language
of
this,
there...
you
just
can't
apply
it
literally.
i
mean,
you
lose
if
you
apply
it
literally.
you
have
to
really
look
beyond
that
language
and
say
does
it
forbid
an
interpretation
that
is
required,
says
the
house
of
lords,
by
looking
at
the
treaty
as
a
whole.
so,
i
don't
find
in
one
of
these
briefs,
anywhere
in
an
appendix,
the
treaty
as
a
whole,
which
isn't
that
long.
so,
i
don't
know
yet.
i'll
have
to
get
it.
it
would
have
been
simpler,
since
that's
their
reasoning,
if
i
could
have
somewhere
looked
at
the
treaty
as
a
whole.
am
i
right?
maybe
hidden--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--but
if
you
look
at
just
provision
by
provision,
you
lose,
don't
you?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
mean,
17
says...
we're
talking
about
instances
where
the
carrier
is
liable
for
a...
for
physical
injury.
and
then
24
says,
in
cases
that
are
foreseen
by...
if
you
want
to
be
loose
about
it,
that's
fair
enough...
in
cases
foreseen
by
article
17,
et
cetera.
and
in
cases
foreseen,
well,
or
covered,
however
you
want
to
put
it,
those
seem
to
be
cases
of
injury,
physical
injury.
now...
now,
to
get
out
of
that,
there
must
be
some
flavor
for
the
statute
as
a
whole
or
something,
or
the
treatise
as
a...
the
treaty
as
a
whole.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
thought...
what
i
was
thinking
of
is
the
exact
words.
he
says,
in
my
opinion,
says
the
judge,
the
answer
to
this
question
is
to
be
found
not
by
an
exact
analysis
of
the
particular
words
used,
but
by
a
consideration
of
the
whole
purpose
of
the
article.
and
then
he
spent
three
pages
trying
to
set
out
the
treaty
and
how
you
look
at
the
whole
thing
and
then
you
understand
that
what
17
is
talking
about
is
personal
injury
cases.
period.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it
would
be.
that's
right.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
we
have
some
language.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so,
do
you
lose
if
i
think
there
was
an
accident?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
know
that's
your
opinion,
and...
and
this
is
disputed.
but
if
i
thought
that
there...
this
is
an
accident,
that
accidents
refer
to
intentional
torts
as
well,
then
do
i
have
to
decide
against
you
in
your
opinion?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
know
you
don't
agree
with
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
but--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--let
me
ask
you
about...
because
i've
now
seen
the
whole
treaty,
as
justice
thomas
had
the...
if
you
look
at
the
treaty
as
a
whole...
and
i
think
this
is
what
the
english
court
was
doing...
it's
saying,
look,
there's
one
section
here,
section
3,
which
says,
airlines,
you
cannot
limit
your
liability
in
a
contract
and
you
give
that
up.
and
then
section
4
says,
but
in
return
for
that,
you're
going
to
be
liable
in
the
following
ways,
and
then
it
lists
a
whole
bunch
of
them
with
qualifications.
and
in
that
context,
all
that
article
24
meant
was
it
meant
to
refer
to
the
three
kinds
of
liabilities
or
situations
you
may
have,
to
people,
to
luggage,
and
for
delay.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
that's
all
it
meant.
and
if
you
don't
read
it
that
way,
you
get
into
a
terrible
mess.
you
get
into
the
mess,
for
example,
that
a
flight
attendant
who
hits
somebody
in
the
face
and
she
says
it
was
an
accident
or
the...
the
passenger
says,
no,
no,
she
did
it
on
purpose,
or...
or
you
have
somebody
suing
in
a
state
court
because
the
air
that's
recirculated
has
germs
in
it
and
they
know
that
the
germs
will,
in
fact,
give
colds
to
a
certain
percentage
of
people,
or
they
serve
coffee
that's
too
hot
and
they
know
that
a
certain
percentage
of
people
are
going
to
get
sore
throats
because
the
coffee
is
too
hot.
i
mean,
there
could
be
millions
of
cases,
and
you're
very...
you
know,
the
bar
is
very
imaginative,
and
they'll
find
terrific
cases.
[laughter]
and
so
our
choice
is
you
either
read
it
vaguely
to
just
refer
to
passengers,
luggage,
and
delay,
or
you
read
it
precisely
by
the
language
and
we
get
into
the
situation
with
your
case
and
many
such
others
are
allowed.
but
the
english
court
says,
that's
the
choice.
we
think
really
the
language
isn't
perfect,
but
you...
they
took
that
choice.
so,
now,
what
is
your...
your...
your
response?
