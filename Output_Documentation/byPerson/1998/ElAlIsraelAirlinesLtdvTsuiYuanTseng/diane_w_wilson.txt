ms.
diane
w.
wilson
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
we
are
here
today
requesting
the
court
to
hold
that
a
multilateral
treaty
of
the
united
states,
commonly
known
as
the
warsaw
convention,
exclusively
governs
recovery
for
passenger
injury
sustained
in
the
course
of
international
air
carriage.
we
are
not
contending
for
a
broad
right
to
avoid
liability.
we
are
requesting
the
court
to
uphold
the
faithful
reading
of
the
convention.
ms.
tseng
is
seeking
purely
emotional
distress
damages
as
a
result
of
being
subjected
to
a
security
search,
an
integral
and
vital
part
of
maintaining
the
safety
and
security
of
international
air
transportation.
the
legal
issue
before
the
court,
however,
is
not
confined
to
the
issue
presented
in
her
case.
it
is
a
global
issue
because
there
are
over
120
nations
adhering
to
the
warsaw
convention.
ms.
diane
w.
wilson
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
diane
w.
wilson
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
diane
w.
wilson
i
would
submit,
justice
o'connor,
you
do
not
because
the
trial
court
found
that
there
was
no
willful
misconduct
in
the
facts
of
this
case,
and
that
finding
was
not
disturbed
by
the
court
of
appeals,
and
therefore
i
do
not
believe
it
is
before
the
court.
ms.
diane
w.
wilson
justice
o'connor,
we
would
submit
that
you
do
not
reach
the
issue
of
willful
misconduct
if
you
do
not
reach
the
threshold
issue
of
meeting
the
conditions
under
article
17.
willful
misconduct
wasn't
intended
to
be
read
outside
of
the
convention.
if
you
were
to
do
so,
then
you
would
be
not
reading
into
the
convention
the
fact
that
articles
17,
18,
and
19
state
the
instances
when
the
carrier
shall
be
held
liable.
article
25...
excuse
me...
article
22
limits
that
liability,
and
article
25,
you
lose
the
limit
if
you
have
willful
misconduct.
but
if
you
read
that
there's
a
recovery
outside
of
the
convention
that
your
holding
is
that
you
have
an
instance
where
you
have
passengers
attempting
to
prove
that
there
isn't
an
accident
so
that
they
are
unable
to
seek
damages
without
limit.
ms.
diane
w.
wilson
yes,
your
honor.
there's
no
reason
to
address
that
in
this
case.
ms.
diane
w.
wilson
well,
it--
ms.
diane
w.
wilson
--yes,
your
honor.
if
you
don't
satisfy
both
conditions,
bodily
injury
and
an
accident,
you're
not
entitled
to
recover
under
the
convention.
ms.
diane
w.
wilson
well,
at
the
time
that
the
convention
was
drafted,
it
was
1929.
the
carriers
were
free
to
disclaim
any
and
all
liability,
and
it
was
a
compromise
to
have
the
liability
that
was
created
under
the
convention
to
be
limited
except
for
in
the
circumstances
provided
for.
so,
if
you
allow
the
passengers
to
seek
unlimited
recovery
outside
the
convention,
you're
creating
an
incentive
for
them
to
try
and
prove
there
isn't
an
accident
so
that
when
they
don't
have
bodily
injury,
they
can
seek
unlimited
damages.
ms.
diane
w.
wilson
well,
they...
i
don't
believe
the
drafters
thought
they
were
doing
that
because
when
they
drafted
the
convention,
they
also
had
article
20
which
was
the
all
necessary
measures
defense.
although
carriers
that
fly
into
and
out
of
the
united
states
are
not
entitled
to
avail
themselves
of
the
all
necessary
measures
defense,
that's
where
the
fault
issue
really
came
into
play.
it
was
the
unusual,
unexpected
occurrence
as
defined
by
saks
which
would
determine
whether
you
have
the
accident
requirement,
and
even
if
you
did,
if
the
carrier
was
able
to
establish
that
it
had
taken
all
reasonable
measures
that
it
could
take,
it
wouldn't
be
liable.
and
if...
it
was
only
if
you
weren't
able
to
establish
that
burden
as
the
carrier,
then
you
would
have
limited
liability.
ms.
diane
w.
wilson
to
do
that,
i
believe
you
have
to
ignore
the
scheme
as
to
how
the
articles
under
the
liability
chapter
were
set
forth.
ms.
diane
w.
wilson
well,
there
are
the
willful
misconduct
instances
with
respect
to,
for
example,
the
pan
am
lockerbie
bombing.
the
terrorist
attack
of
placing
the
bomb
on
board
the
aircraft
wasn't
what
was
found
to
be
the
willful
misconduct,
although
it
clearly
was
intentional
conduct.
the
willful
misconduct
on
the
part
of
the
carrier
had
to
do
with
their
security
measures
and
their
program
or
the
lack
thereof.
and
there
are
other
instances
in
which
the...
there
have
been
terrorist
attacks
or
hijackings
in
which
the
carriers
are
found
to
be
responsible
in
damages,
but
they're
not
held
to
the
level
of
willful
misconduct.
and,
therefore,
the
limit
of
the
passengers
is
the
limit
that
is
applicable.
ms.
diane
w.
wilson
well,
the
court
didn't
address
on
point,
when
they
reached
the
lockerbie
decision,
the
issue
of
whether
the
security
measures
was
what
triggered
the
accident
requirement.
ms.
diane
w.
wilson
well,
my
view
is
that
the--
ms.
diane
w.
wilson
--well,
yes,
but...
but
it
also
would
have...
the
accident
also
could
be
the
unusual
and
unexpected
event
of
having
the
bomb
placed
on
the
aircraft,
but
the
conduct
of
the
carrier
that
rose
to
the
level
of
intentional,
the
willful
misconduct
on
the
part
of
the
carrier,
was
their
security
program.
ms.
diane
w.
wilson
yes,
i
believe
that
would...
could
constitute
an
accident.
i
just
don't
think
that
was
what
the
court--
ms.
diane
w.
wilson
--was
driving
at
in
that
case,
your
honor.
ms.
diane
w.
wilson
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
diane
w.
wilson
no.
i
believe,
your
honor,
that
the
lockerbie
decision
rested
more
on
the
fact
that
pan
am
was
charging
a
$5
surcharge
per
passenger
for
the
heightened
security
that
they
claimed
that
they
were
providing
when,
in
fact,
it
turned
out
that
the
trial
showed
that
they
had
done
such
things
as
taken
dogs
from
the
local
pound
and
pretended
like
they
were
trained
as
dog--
ms.
diane
w.
wilson
--right.
in
fact,
you
could
say
they
were
misrepresenting
the
nature
of
the
security
they
were
providing.
ms.
diane
w.
wilson
well,
broadly
speaking,
that's
true,
but
in
the
context
of
international
security,
to
hold
that
the
provision
of
security
services
is
an
unusual
and
unexpected
event,
i
do
not
think
would
be
borne
out.
the...
we
didn't
need
to
reach
that
issue
in
this
case
because
you
need
to
meet
both
conditions
in
order
to
recover
under
the
convention,
and
it
was
undisputed
by
the
respondent
that
plaintiff
did
not
sustain
a
bodily
injury
and
that
she
was
in
the
course
of
embarkation.
so,
the
only
issue
that
ended
up
going
up
insofar
as
the
respondent
was
concerned
when
he
appealed
or,
i
should
say,
ms.
tseng
appealed
to
the
second
circuit
was
whether
the
court
was
incorrect
in
finding
that
the
search
constituted
an
accident.
but
for
us
to
bring
it
up
to
this
level,
it's
the...
it's
the
broader
issue
of
whether
or
not
the
treaty
is
exclusive,
and
if
you
don't
meet
both
conditions,
you
don't
have
a
right
to
recovery.
and
in
this
particular
case,
you
didn't
have
to
reach
the
accident
issue
because
she
didn't
have
bodily
injury.
ms.
diane
w.
wilson
thank
you.
the...
the
court
did
not
have
squarely
before
it,
until
this
case,
the
question
of
exclusivity,
but
we
believe
that
the
franklin
mint,
saks,
chan,
floyd,
and
zicherman
decisions
nevertheless
issued
a...
a
line
of
cases
which
should
have
directed
the
lower
court
to
find
that
the
convention
is
exclusive.
in
franklin
mint,
the
court
recognized
the
dual
purposes
of
the
convention,
which
were
to
create
a
uniform
body
of
aviation
law
and
to
limit
the
carrier's
presumptive
liability.
in
saks,
the
court
broadly
defined
what
constitutes
an
accident
contemplated
by
article
17
and
held
that
the
carrier
is
liable
to
a
passenger
only
if
the
passenger
proves
there
was
an
accident
that
was
the
cause
of
the
injury.
then
in
chan,
the
court
enforced
the
limited
liability
created
by
the
drafters
and
looked
to
the
parallel
notice
provisions
with
respect
to
baggage
and
cargo
to
interpret
the
notice
provision
for
the
passenger
tickets.
in
floyd,
the
court
enforced
the
article
17
bodily
injury
requirement
holding
that
the
carrier
cannot
be
held
liable
under
17
unless
the
accident
has
caused
bodily
injury.
in
zicherman,
the
court
gave
the
most
natural
reading
of
article
24
and
held
that
in
an
action
brought
under
article
17,
article
24
directs
the
lower
court
to
look
to
local
law
to
determine
the
measure
of
the
passenger's
recovery
and
who
may
bring
a
suit.
we
contend
that
in
this
case
that
the
court
once
again
needs
to
interpret
the
convention
as
a
whole
and
not
attempt
to
divine
what
article
17
or
article
24
means
read
standing
alone.
the
carrier
has
created
a
clear
scheme
of
liability
to...
to
govern
international
transportation,
and
if
you
read
the
scheme
in
terms
of
the
chapter
3
liability,
the
only
sensible
reading
is
that
the
convention
was
intended
to
be
exclusive,
the
passenger
was
entitled
to
limited...
to
limited
recovery
if
the
passenger
met
the
conditions
under
article
17.
ms.
diane
w.
wilson
justice
stevens,
i
wouldn't
agree
with
that
position
because
i
do
not
view
article
17
as
determining
the
scope
of
the
convention.
article
1
determines
the
scope.
article
17
tells
when
you're
going
to
be
liable--
ms.
diane
w.
wilson
--well,
i...
i
don't
in
the
sense
that
i
say
covered
by
17
means
that
they
concern
passenger
injury
or
death
cases,
not
that
it
concerns
whether
or
not
you
have
a
recoverable
claim
under
article
17.
ms.
diane
w.
wilson
it
is
a
passenger
injury
case,
and
therefore
it
falls
under
article
17,
but
the
passenger
in
this
instance
does
not
state
a
recoverable
claim
under
17.
ms.
diane
w.
wilson
this
passenger's
claim?
ms.
diane
w.
wilson
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
diane
w.
wilson
yes.
ms.
diane
w.
wilson
it's
covered
by
17
because
it's
a
passenger
claim.
ms.
diane
w.
wilson
yes,
i
do,
your
honor.
ms.
diane
w.
wilson
i...
i
would
not
agree
that
it's
inapplicable.
i
would
say
the
passenger
simply
cannot
meet
the
conditions
that
article
17
stipulates.
ms.
diane
w.
wilson
i
do
suggest
that,
your
honor,
because
i
suggest
that
article
1
is
intended
to
provide
for
all
of
international
air
transportation
for
passengers
for
hire,
and
article
17
i
do
not
believe
should
have
to
have
a
subparagraph
2
saying
that
unless
you
meet
these
conditions...
if
you
don't
meet
these
conditions,
you're
entitled
to
sue
outside
the
convention.
i
believe
that
if
you
read
the
language
fairly,
that...
and
you
read
that
in
relation
to
all
the
other
provisions
under
article...
excuse
me...
chapter
3--
ms.
diane
w.
wilson
--i...
i
believe
that
it
does
when
you
read
the...
the
articles
in
succession,
and
i
believe
that
if
you...
although
i...
i
don't
believe
you
need
to
refer
to
the
drafting
history,
if
you
do
refer
to
the
drafting
history,
i
don't...
i
don't
think
that
you
can
sensibly
read
the
articles
to
mean
that
the...
the
drafters
thought
they
were
leaving
a
category
of
cases
with
respect
to
passenger
injury
outside
of
the
convention.
ms.
diane
w.
wilson
i
believe
that
because
treaties
should
be
faithfully
upheld,
that
it
is
appropriate
to
look
to
the
drafting
history
in
respect
of
the
warsaw
convention,
in
particular
the
warsaw
minutes
which
were
transcribed
by
horner
and
legrez,
and
if
you
read
them
in
total,
including
the
comments
of
sir
alfred
dennis
and
the
reporter
and
various
other
delegates,
it's
clear
that
they
were
intending
it
to
be
all
encompassing
with
respect
to
passenger
claims.
but
i...
i
do
believe
that
you'd
be
doing
so
to
confirm
the
reading,
which
is
that
if
you
read
the
articles
and
read
the
structure
in
the
scheme
of
the
convention,
the
conclusion
should
be
that
the
convention
is
exclusive.
ms.
diane
w.
wilson
justice
ginsburg,
i...
i
do
take
the
position
that
article
24
is
telling
the
courts
that
you
are
not
permitted
to
look
outside
the
convention
for
causes
of
action.
i...
i
believe
that
24
has
to
be
read
in
conjunction
with
17
and
with
1,
and...
and
the
articles
all
interrelate
under
chapter
3,
including
articles
17
and
24,
to
reach
the
conclusion
that
you
cannot
have
a
recovery
outside
the
convention.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i
would
like
to
reserve
rebuttal.
ms.
diane
w.
wilson
your
honors,
i
would
just
like
to
make
two
brief
points.
one
is
that
the
court
below
specifically
found
that
there
was
no
willful
misconduct
in
this
case,
and
that's
referenced
at
page
27
of
the
appendix
to
the
petition.
and
also
that
accident
can
encompass
intentional
torts.
that's
what
article
25
can
look
to.
it
is
only
if
you
have
willful
misconduct
that
you
get
an
unlimited
recovery.
accident
wasn't
ever
meant
to
mean
unintended.
i
also
would
note
that
you
should
meet
the
terms
and
conditions
of
article
25.
you
have
to
meet
the
terms
and
conditions
of
article
24.
there
is
a
symmetry
there.
and
with
respect
to
the
issue
of
article
18,
i
believe
that
the
fact
that
the
liability
is
broader
in
scope
with
respect
to
baggage
and
cargo
should
not
mean
that
if...
where
you
have
a
narrower
scope
of
liability
under
the
convention,
you
then
get
to
get
recovery
outside
of
the
convention.
thank
you.
