anthony
m.
kennedy
are
you
saying
it's
covered
by
17
because
17
embraces
the
universe
of
personal
hurt,
excluding
baggage
and
delay?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--it
covers
the
universe
and...
and
in
this
case
it
is
inapplicable,
but
it
has
sufficient
breadth
so
that
24
kicks
in.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
do
you
read
article
17
as
saying...
for
purposes
of
article
24,
as
saying
something
like
in
all
cases
covered
by
article
17,
excluding
or
including
liability,
the
provisions
of
the
preceding
paragraph
apply?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
we're
aware
of
that,
but
just
i
want
to
be
quite
sure
of
your
interpretation
of
the
first
phrase
of
paragraph...
subparagraph
2
of
article
24.
in
the
cases
covered
by
article
17,
what...
what
does
that
mean?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
whether
or
not
liability--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--exists.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--because
there
was
no
physical
injury.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--you
agree
that
an
important
class
of...
of
injuries,
of
torts,
are
excluded
by
this
treaty
and
that
there
can
be
no
state
cause
of
action.
what
would
be
the
purpose
of
a
treaty
under
your
interpretation
if
this
really
relatively
less
consequential
kind
of
tort
was...
was
not
also
excluded?
how
do
you
respond,
in
other
words,
to
lord
hope's
opinion
that
the
whole
structure
of
the
treaty
dictates
a
holding
against
you?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well...
well,
but
as
the
case
comes
to
us,
willful
misconduct
is
definitely
excluded
by
the
treaty.
serious
accidents
are
sometimes
limited
because
of
17
and...
and
saks
and
floyd.
but
you
have
this
narrow
class
of
cases
which
you
say
is
not...
is
not
covered
by
the
treaty.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
it
seems
to
me
that
that's
inconsistent
with
the
whole
design
of
the
treaty
to
limit
the
liability.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
that
isn't
this
case.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
it
does
but
the
difference
in
17
and
18
is
18
doesn't
refer
to
an
accident.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
yes.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
which,
it
seems
to
me,
helps
you.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
right.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
which
is
what
helps
you.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
did
i
understand
that
your--
[laughter]
did
i
understand
you
to
suggest
that
the
government's
position
in
its
brief
in
saks
is
inconsistent
or
at
least
in
tension
with
what
it's
arguing
here?
