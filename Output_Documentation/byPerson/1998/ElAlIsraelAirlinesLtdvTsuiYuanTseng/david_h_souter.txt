justice
david
h.
souter
--i
suppose
we
ought
to
let
you
address
this
case.
[laughter]
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
to
make
that
clear,
don't
we
really
look
outside
the
text?
i
mean,
you
can...
you
can
go
back
to
the
introductory
sentence
of
article
1.1
and
i
suppose
still
theoretically
have
a
question
open
as
to
whether,
given
the
applicability
of
the
convention
to...
to
all
possible
instances
here,
the
convention
may
still
allow,
in
effect,
by
reference
to
outside
law,
the
possibility
of...
of
a
claim
under
domestic
law.
and
to
answer
that
question
definitively,
don't
we
have
to
look
outside
the
text
of
the
convention
and...
and
consider
the...
the
intentions
that
were
expressed
at
the
time
this
language
was...
was
proposed
and
adopted?
for
example,
the...
the
statement
of
the
british
representative
to
the
warsaw
convention,
that
there's
no
more
common
law.
don't
we
have
to
look
to
things
like
the
no
more
common
law
statement
in
order
to
get
to
a
definitive
answer
to
the
question
that
we
have?
justice
david
h.
souter
i
take
it
then
you...
you
disagree
with
your
fellow
counsel
here
that
the
language
of
the...
of
the
convention
requires
your
result.
i
take
it
your
position
is
that
the
language
of
the
convention
is
ambiguous,
but
if
you
take
into
consideration
anomaly,
drafting
history,
and
so
on,
your
result
is
the...
is
the...
is
the
reasonable
result.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
on
the
other
hand,
you
benefit
somewhat--
justice
david
h.
souter
i
thought
judge...
the...
i'm
not
sure
of
this
factual
thing.
that's
what
i
want.
el
al
says,
look,
she
didn't
object
to
the
search
and
she
never
asked
to
leave
the
room,
and
anybody
would
know
that
if
you
want
to
go
home,
you
go
home.
it's
only
if
you
want
to
go
on
the
flight
that
you
have
to
be
searched.
so,
that's
their
position.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
i
take
it
your
position
was
that
they
had
a
legal
duty
to
say
to
her,
now,
if
you
object
to
the
search,
you
can
go
and
leave
the
room.
justice
david
h.
souter
is
that...
was
that--
justice
david
h.
souter
--and
is
there
a
finding
on
whether...
i
guess
that's
a
legal
question.
justice
david
h.
souter
there's
no
finding.
justice
david
h.
souter
so,
is
that
relevant
at
all
to
us?
i
mean,
what
are
we
supposed
to
take?
i...
i...
we
have
to
take
that
she
never
objected
to
the
search.
we
have
to
take
that
she
never
asked
to
leave
the
room.
we
have
to
take
that
they
didn't
tell
her
she
could
object
to
the
search,
and
then
where
are
we?
what
are
we
supposed
to
do?
justice
david
h.
souter
i
agree
with
you.
i
agree
with
you
on
that.
justice
david
h.
souter
it's
irrelevant.
