justice
sandra
day
o'connor
may
i
ask
you
a
preliminary
question
that
is
a
little
confusing?
the
court
below
found
that
this
was
not
an
accident.
is
that
right?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
we
take
the
case
on
that
assumption.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
there
is
an
article
in
the
convention
setting
aside
limits
of
liability
in
the
case
of
willful
misconduct,
but
we
don't
have
that
issue
before
us
in
this
case?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
if
there
were
a
case
of
willful
misconduct,
then
there...
there
would
be
no
limit
on
the
liability,
or
you
would
look
to
the
law
of
the
nation
trying
the
case
to
determine
that
liability?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so,
in
any
event
in
this
case,
we
simply
don't
address
the
issue
of
article
25
and
how
that
would
bear
on
it.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
are
there
any
other
cases
from
other
jurisdictions
of
member
nations
to
the
warsaw
convention
that
we
can
look
to
besides
abnett
from
the
house
of
lords?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--but
i
thought,
as
the
case
came
to
us,
we
had
to
assume
that
article
25
isn't
before
us,
that
we
take
the
case
as
though
it
isn't
willful
misconduct
under
article
25.
am
i
wrong?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
and
there
was
a
finding
below
that
it
wasn't
willful
misconduct?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
okay,
but
there
was
no
cross
petition
on
that.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
oh,
but
there's
no
doubt
at
all
in
reading
that
opinion
that,
faced
with
this
case,
they
would
have
come
out
the
same
way.
there's...
i
mean,
that's
how
they
construed
the
treaty
is
to
be
an
overall...
overarching
purpose
to
govern
exclusively
liability
of
international
air.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
there
was
a
new
zealand
case--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--was
there
not,
but
it
involved
goods
not
a
passenger,
and
the
new
zealand
case
took
the
same
position
as
the
house
of
lords?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
think
so.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
no,
but
the
question
was
the
exclusivity
of
the
treaty.
and
i
think
there
was
also
a
case
from
singapore.
