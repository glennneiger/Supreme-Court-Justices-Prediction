mr.
robert
h.
silk
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court:
montreal
no.
4
was
enacted
5
or
6
years
after
this
incident
occurred.
montreal
no.
4
is
prospective,
as
the
solicitor
general
pointed
out
in
his
brief.
montreal
number--
mr.
robert
h.
silk
--well,
the
senate
report
may
have
said
that,
but
the
senate
report
was
not
in
effect
at
the
time
this
particular
incident
occurred.
mr.
robert
h.
silk
my
position--
mr.
robert
h.
silk
--exactly.
mr.
robert
h.
silk
my...
my
contention
is
that
the
treaty
says...
means
what
it
says,
and
what
it
means
is
that
article
1,
which
defines
the
scope
and
the
breadth
of
the
convention
as
dealing
with
international
air
transportation,
does
not
preclude
or
preempt
anything,
that
article
20...
if
it
did
preempt
everything,
then
article
24
would
be
unnecessary.
article
24
is
the
only
preemption
or
the
only
exclusive
provision
for
convention
exclusivity
that
there
is,
and
article
24,
as
applicable
in
this
situation,
refers
only...
in
personal
injury
cases,
refers
only
to
cases
covered
by
article
17.
mr.
robert
h.
silk
article
24
preempts
only
accident
cases.
this
was
not
an
accident
case.
this
was
not
a
case
in
which--
mr.
robert
h.
silk
--i
think
the
cases
in
which
article
17
addresses.
and
the
cases
which
article
17
addresses
are
cases
which
are
resulting
from
accidents.
it's
so
stated
very
explicitly
in
article
17.
counsel,
i
believe,
has
admitted
in
response
to
your
honor's
question
that
she
is...
agrees
that
this
case
does
not
involve
an
accident.
this
case
does
not
involve
an
accident.
that's
also
assumed
by
the
questions
presented
for
review.
mr.
robert
h.
silk
except
that's
only
true
if
the
accident
that
caused
the
damage
took
place
on
board
an
aircraft
in
the
course
and
so
on.
mr.
robert
h.
silk
but
that's...
that's...
that's...
that
modifies
the
entire
first
sentence
and
first
clause
of
article
17
because
the
first
clause
says
that
it
shall
be
liable
for
damages
sustained
for
bodily
injury
if
the
accident
which
caused
the
damage.
so,
the
existence
of
an
accident
is
critical
under
the
saks
case,
and
under...
under...
under
all
of
these
cases,
it's
a
critical
element.
mr.
robert
h.
silk
there
was
no
accident.
mr.
robert
h.
silk
i...
i
believe
that
if
this
was
an
accident,
if
this
was
an
accident,
which
would
be
contrary
to
all--
mr.
robert
h.
silk
--to
the
meaning
of
an
accident,
if
this
was
an
accident,
that's
true.
we
would
not...
would
not
be
in
court.
mr.
robert
h.
silk
yes,
there
was
no
physical
injury.
that's
correct.
mr.
robert
h.
silk
well,
i
would
agree
that
if
this
was
an
accident
and
not
an
intentional
tort,
that
the
article
17
would
apply
and
article
24
would
apply,
and
it
would
preclude
the
accident...
anything
from
happening
because
of
floyd
because
the
fact
that
the
injuries
were
psychic
and
were
not
bodily
injuries,
if
this
was
an
accident.
mr.
robert
h.
silk
yes.
mr.
robert
h.
silk
oh,
yes.
mr.
robert
h.
silk
oh,
yes,
i
would
certainly
agree
with
that.
but
the
critical
question
is
the
one
that
was
decided
by
the
second
circuit
that
this
was
not
an
accident.
and
the
second
circuit
based
its
decision
on...
on
the...
on
the
saks
case
principally
and
on
all
of
the
cases--
mr.
robert
h.
silk
--it's
only
a
condition
if
it's
an
accident
caused
it.
mr.
robert
h.
silk
and
that's
what
it
says
in
article
17.
mr.
robert
h.
silk
well,
if
that
was
intended
to
be
the
case,
then
the
convention
would
have
been
written
in
a
different
way.
article
17
was
not
written
that
way.
article
17
predicated
liability
for
death
or
wounding
or
bodily
injury
only
if
there
was
an
accident.
mr.
robert
h.
silk
well,
i
believe
that
the
convention
intended
to
include
only
accidents
in
article
17
and
intended
to
include
everything
else
under
article
18,
which
is
exactly
what
the
saks
case
said,
and
it's
exactly
what
the
solicitor
general
argued
in
the
saks
case
in
the
solicitor
general's
brief
amicus.
and
the
brief
amicus
of
the
solicitor
general,
which
i
would
recommend
to
this
court
as
a
good
text
for
this
subject
matter...
in
the
solicitor
general's
brief
they
emphasized
the
importance
and
the
critical
necessity
that
there
first
be
an
accident,
and
an
accident
is
defined
as
something
which
is
unforeseen,
which
is--
mr.
robert
h.
silk
--accident...
accident
is
not
defined
in
the
treaty,
but
accident
is
defined
in
the
treaty,
if
you
look
at
the
french,
which
means...
which
is
the
original
language
of
the
treaty,
and
they
use
the
word
l'accident
or...
i
don't
know
if
i'm
pronouncing
it
right.
mr.
robert
h.
silk
and...
and
i'll
give
you
another
one.
they...
they
use
the
word
l'evenement,
which
means
an...
an
incident
or
an
occurrence,
in
article
18.
an
incident
or
occurrence
could
include
an
intentional
wrong,
but
an
accident
excludes
an
intentional
wrong.
and
therefore
intentional
wrongs
were
not
intended
to
be
covered
by
article
17,
and
therefore--
mr.
robert
h.
silk
--well,
i...
i--
mr.
robert
h.
silk
--article
17
is
in...
is
in
the
petitioner's
supplemental
brief.
article...
article
24
is
in
the
petitioner's
supplemental
brief.
mr.
robert
h.
silk
right.
mr.
robert
h.
silk
because
i
see
nothing
in
the
structure
of
the
treaty
that
says
that
the...
that
a...
that
would
indicate
that
a
willful
tort,
an
assault
and
battery
and
a
false
imprisonment,
committed
by
an
airline
against
a
passenger
is
something
which
is
inconsequential
or
which
could
be
included
or
excluded.
it
doesn't
even
touch
the
subject.
there
is
not
a
word
in
the
convention
that
i
know
of
which
speaks
of
the
type
of
tort
and
the
type
of
willful
wrongdoing
which
occurred
in
this
case.
now,
article
1
says
that
the
convention
covers
the
whole
area
of
space,
but
it...
it
preempts
nothing.
mr.
robert
h.
silk
article
25,
but
article
25
is
good
for
the
respondent
in
this
case.
mr.
robert
h.
silk
i
will
withdraw.
you're
right,
your
honor.
the
only
place
in
the
convention
where
willful
wrongs
are...
such
as
the
kind
which
occurred
in
this
case
is
mentioned
is
article
25.
article
25
doesn't
give
a
right
to
a
cause
of
action
but
it
says
nothing
in
the
convention
shall
restrict
and
prevent
a
cause
of
action.
mr.
robert
h.
silk
as
the
case
came
before
this
court,
the
petitioner
did
not
mention
article
25
in
the
petition.
that's
correct.
and
in
opposition
to
the
petition,
there
was
particularly
no
reason
to
address
article
25--
mr.
robert
h.
silk
--no.
the
finding
below
was
that
it
was
not
such
willful
misconduct...
such
willful
misconduct
as
to
come
in
under
article
25,
which
is
a
conclusion
of
law.
this
is
not
a
statement
of
fact,
and
this
is
not
a
fact
finding--
mr.
robert
h.
silk
--we
weren't
aggrieved.
the...
the
respondent
was
not
aggrieved
at
all
by
the
final
ruling,
and
there
was
really
no
need
to...
to
burden
this
court
with
a
cross
petition
on
an
academic
subject.
mr.
robert
h.
silk
well,
willful
misconduct--
mr.
robert
h.
silk
--willful
misconduct
is
covered
by
the
convention
only
to
the
extent
that
nothing
in
the
convention
shall
limit
or
exclude...
exclude
such
a
case.
mr.
robert
h.
silk
well,
we're
talking
about
excluding
such
a
case,
and
if
there's
nothing
in
the
convention
to
exclude
my
case,
then
i
go
ahead.
mr.
robert
h.
silk
article
25
is
fine.
mr.
robert
h.
silk
yes.
mr.
robert
h.
silk
my
view
on
the
abnett
case,
or
the
english
case,
the
house
of
lords
case,
is
that
the
house
of
lords
case
did
not
deal
with
the
kind
of
willful
problem
that
we
have
in
my
case.
the
house
of
lords
was
dealing
with
a
situation
which
was
completely
accidental
to
the
airline
and
it
was...
it
was
a
breach
of
contract
of
passage
or
negligence
in
landing
in
kuwait
at
the
time
that
the
plane
did
land
in
kuwait,
but
it
did
not
deal
at
all
with
the
kind
of
common
law
tort...
willful
torts,
that
we
have
in
this
case.
it
just
wasn't
dealing
with
it.
so,
the
english
court
can
go
ahead
and
say
whatever
it
wants
with
respect
to
the
kind
of
cases
that
they
were
dealing
with,
but
the
fact
problem
before
that
court
is
totally
different
from
the
fact
problem
before
this
court.
mr.
robert
h.
silk
my
only
answer
to
that
would
be
that
the
treaty
governs
what
it
governs,
and
the
treaty...
the
language
of
the
treaty
spells
out
what
it
does
govern.
it's
true
that
the
treaty
could
govern
an
intentional
wrongdoing
such
as
we
have
in
my
case,
but
it
doesn't.
it
uses
the
word
accident
deliberately
and
it
uses
the
word
event
or
occurrence
in
article
18
in
a
deliberate
way
as
this
court
pointed
out
in
the
saks
case.
i
do
not
see
anything
in
the
treaty
which
anywhere
near...
comes
near
to
governing
this
case.
it's
certainly
not
an
accident.
the
very
question
before
this
court
right
now,
which...
upon
which
the
court
granted
certiorari,
the
very
question
is
assuming
this
is
not
an
accident,
if
it's
not
an
accident,
then
is
it
covered?
so,
we
can't
assume
that
it's
covered
in
any
way
by
article
17.
mr.
robert
h.
silk
but
this
procedure
in
my
case
did
not
misfire.
the
procedure
in
my
case
went
precisely
the
way
it
was
intended.
it
was
a
routine.
it
was
intended.
it
was
a
security
check.
and
i
will
say
that
the
airline
had
a
right
to
conduct
the
security
check.
they
had
a
right
to
do
it,
but
they
didn't
have
a
right
to
do
it
without
the
consent
of
my
client.
and
without
the
consent
of
my
client,
just
as
a
doctor
has
a
right
to
perform
surgery,
he
doesn't
have
a
right
to
do
it
without
the
consent
of
his
patient,
the
airline
here
did
not
have
a
right
to
conduct
a
security
check
without
the
consent
of
my
client.
if
my
client
didn't
want
to
consent,
then
my
client
would
have
been
barred
from
boarding
the
plane
by
the
federal
regulations.
mr.
robert
h.
silk
no.
the
airline
does
not
dispute
anything
at
all.
the
issues
in
this
case
are
free
of
factual
problems
or
factual
complications.
the
airline
does
not
dispute
it.
the...
in...
in
my...
in
the
respondent's
brief,
in
the
statement
of
the
case,
it
was
pointed
out...
the
testimony
was
even
gone
through,
i
believe,
verbatim
as
part
of
the...
of
the
statement
of...
of
the
case.
and
it
pointed
out
that
my
client
didn't
consent.
she
wasn't
asked
to
consent.
she
was
overwhelmed
and
so
on
by
the
authority
which
was
exhibited
by
the
security
people,
and
they
didn't
ask
her
consent.
the
federal
regulation
says
that
if
she
doesn't
consent,
then
she
cannot
board
the
plane.
all
the
security
problems
are
taken
care
of.
mr.
robert
h.
silk
they
didn't.
they
had
factual
testimony
and
their
factual
testimony
was
to
the
effect
that
what
they
did
in
her
case
was
part
of
their
routine
and--
mr.
robert
h.
silk
--was
there
what?
mr.
robert
h.
silk
yes,
there
was
a
trial
in
this
case.
there
was
a
trial
in
this
case
before
judge
stanton
in
the
federal
district
court
in
the
southern
district
of
new
york.
and
in
that
trial,
the
liability
issues
were
proved
and
part
of
the
damage
issues
were
proved,
that
is,
to
the
extent
that
my
client
testified
to
the
suffering
and
to
the--
mr.
robert
h.
silk
--no,
no.
when
i
say
proved,
i
mean
prima
facie
proof.
there
was
testimony.
there
was
testimony
concerning
all
of
these
things,
cross
examination,
testimony,
cross
examination.
el
al
put
on
witnesses,
and...
and
the
judge
said...
i
think
he
said,
do
you
have
anything
else,
and
i
said,
yes,
i
have
psychiatric
testimony
to
put
on
to
show
psychiatric
injury
and
causal
relationship
and
so
on
and
so
forth.
and
the
trial
judge
said,
you
don't
need
to
do
it
because
if
the
only
problem
is
psychic,
it's
being
dismissed
under
floyd.
and
i
said,
but...
and
i
argued
there
that...
that
this
was
not
an
accident
and
floyd
applies
only
to
accidents
under
article
17,
and
the
judge
said,
yes,
it
was
an
accident
because
she
turned
out
not
to
be
a
terrorist.
so,
what
the
judge
did
was
saying
because
she
was
innocent,
she
therefore
cannot
prevail
because
that
was
an
accident
that
she
was
examined
like
that.
mr.
robert
h.
silk
yes.
mr.
robert
h.
silk
yes.
mr.
robert
h.
silk
yes.
mr.
robert
h.
silk
there
was
no
finding.
mr.
robert
h.
silk
there
was
no
finding
at
all.
mr.
robert
h.
silk
well,
i
think
that
that
is
not
the
question
before
this
court.
i
think
that
that
is
not
the
question
before
this
court.
and
i
just
want
to
say
that
that
question
was
not
raised
really
in
the
petition
for
certiorari
and
is
not
a
question
before
this
court.
in
the
phillips
case,
which
this
court
recently
decided,
i
believe
the
phillips
court
said
that...
this
court
said
that
only
questions
set
forth
in
the
petition--
mr.
robert
h.
silk
--may
properly
be
used.
mr.
robert
h.
silk
it's
only
relevant
when...
when
i
think
they
raised
the
red
flag
that
this
involves
a
security
problem
and...
and
they
have
to
be
able
to
protect
their
security,
which
i
think
is...
is
sham
argument
because
they
could
easily
have
protected
their
security
by
giving
her
a
choice.
mr.
robert
h.
silk
justice
ginsburg,
i
have
tried
to
find
any
other
precedents.
i
don't
think
the
house
of
lords
precedent
is
a
precedent
because
i
don't
believe
that
it
deals
with--
mr.
robert
h.
silk
--i
know
of
none
which
involve
this
kind
of
situation.
and
i...
i...
in
security
checks
or
in
any
other...
in
any
other
context
where
an
assault
and
battery
or
a
false
imprisonment
was
the
subject
of
the
action,
of
a
common
law
action,
and
the
question
of
the
convention
arose.
mr.
robert
h.
silk
i
just
didn't
know--
mr.
robert
h.
silk
--i
don't
know.
mr.
robert
h.
silk
i
just
don't
know.
incidentally,
if
the
new
zealand
case
would...
would
involve
baggage
and
not
passengers,
security,
then
24(1)
and
not
24(2)
would
apply,
and
24(1)
does
not
refer
to...
under
article
17.
it
refers
to
article
18--
mr.
robert
h.
silk
--but
article--
mr.
robert
h.
silk
--right,
but
by
article
18
and
19.
mr.
robert
h.
silk
i...
i
would
like
to
suggest,
if
i
may,
that
article
17
is
a
liability
provision.
it
is
dealing
with
liability.
its
whole
focus
is
liability.
its
focus
is
not
just
passengers.
its
focus
is
liability.
mr.

mr.
robert
h.
silk
--article
18--
mr.
robert
h.
silk
--i
believe
it
does
then,
overhearing
counsel
here
saying
yes,
so
it
probably
does.
mr.
robert
h.
silk
it
refers
to
an
occurrence.
mr.
robert
h.
silk
and
it's
much
broader,
and
it
would
include...
if
that
word
were
used
in
article
17--
mr.
robert
h.
silk
--if
that
word
were
included
in
article
17,
it
would...
it
would
hurt
me
because
article
17
would
be...
would...
would
say
that...
that...
if
it
was
an
occurrence,
it
would
fall
under
article
17,
and
if
it
fell
under
article...
if
article
17
used
the
word
occurrence,
this
event
would
have
fallen
under
article
17.
and
therefore
it
would
have
been
precluded
by
article
24
too.
it
would
have
been
precluded.
but
article
17
does--
mr.
robert
h.
silk
--not
say
occurrence,
and
that
is
very
helpful--
mr.
robert
h.
silk
--that
helps
me,
right.
and
the
saks
case
points
out
the
very
important
difference
of
language
between
article
17
and
article
18,
and
in
saks
and
also...
not
only
in
saks,
but
the
solicitor
general
and
the
solicitor
general's
brief
amicus
in
the
saks
case.
it
writes
practically
a
textbook
on
this
subject
in
which
he
points
out
the
difference
between
the
usage
of...
of
the
word
for
occurrence
in
article
18,
the
french
word
for
occurrence
in
article
18,
and
the
french
word
for
accident
in
article
17.
they
make
a
world
of
difference.
mr.
robert
h.
silk
yes.
mr.
robert
h.
silk
well,
it
would
change
it
if
my
case
had
occurred
6
years
after
it
occurred
and
montreal
protocol
no.
4
was
in
effect
at
the
time.
mr.
robert
h.
silk
well,
if
it
happened
after
montreal
4
became
effective--
mr.
robert
h.
silk
--which
would
be
in
a
few
months,
i
think--
mr.
robert
h.
silk
--i
mean,
if
that's
what
your
honor
means.
mr.
robert
h.
silk
okay.
my
case
would
be
out
the
window,
i
think.
mr.
robert
h.
silk
but
my
case
cannot
be
out
the
window
because
montreal
4
is
prospective
and
it's
not
retroactive,
and
has
practically
been
conceded
by
everybody,
nobody
has
really
claimed
that
it's
retroactive.
mr.
robert
h.
silk
well,
it's
clearly
new
because
in
article
24
as
it
was,
it
says,
in
cases
covered
by
article
17.
now,
article
24
under
the
montreal
protocol
says,
in
the
carriage
of
passengers
and
baggage,
any
action
for
damage,
however
founded,
can
only
be
brought
subject
to
the
conditions
of
this...
of
this
convention.
and
the
words
under
article...
covered
by
article
17
are
completely
out.
mr.
robert
h.
silk
i
don't
know
of
any
of
them.
mr.
robert
h.
silk
i...
i
believe
so
because
the
government
in
this
case
has
been
arguing
that
this
is
some
kind
of
an
accident,
and
accident
can
be
broadly
interpreted.
they
have
done
so
in
their
brief.
the
word
accident
can
be
very
broadly
interpreted
to
include
a
multitude
of
sins,
whereas
in
the...
in
the
brief
in
the...
in
the
saks
case,
they
very...
they
say
accident
is
very
narrow.
and
i'm
answering
your
question,
but--
mr.
robert
h.
silk
--all
right.
mr.
robert
h.
silk
thank
you,
your
honor.
thank
you.
