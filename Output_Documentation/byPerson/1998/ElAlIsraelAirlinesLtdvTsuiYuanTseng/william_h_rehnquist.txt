--but
that
still
doesn't
seem
to
me
a
good
explanation
for
why
the
convention
would
cover
accidents
that
really
were
no
fault
of
the
carrier
and
exclude
liability
for
something
that's
intentional
wrongdoing
on
the
part
of
the
carrier.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
isn't
it
just
as
fair
a
reading...
and
granted,
article
25
is
not
before
us
in
this
case,
but
when
we're
construing
the
convention
as
a
whole,
we
have
to
have
some
mind
for
the
type
of
thing
article
25
covers...
just
as
fair
a
reading
of
article
25
to
say
that
the
convention
does
permit
recovery,
but
the
limits
are
off?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
ms.
wilson.
mr.

rehnquist
the
introductory
clause
for
which
article?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
nuechtherlein.
mr.
silk,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
where
is
accident
defined
in...
in
the
treaty,
mr.
silk?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
neither
do
i.--

article
25.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
said
that
nothing
in
the
convention
covered--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes,
but
i
think
you've...
you've
answered
it.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
silk.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
ms.
wilson,
you
have
a
little
more
than
a
minute
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
ms.
wilson.
the
case
is
submitted.
