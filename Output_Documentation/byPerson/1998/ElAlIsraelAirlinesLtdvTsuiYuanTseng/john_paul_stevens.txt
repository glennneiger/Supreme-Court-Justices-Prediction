justice
john
paul
stevens
but
is...
do
i
correctly
understand
that
your
position
is
that
it
does
not
matter
whether
this
is
a
case
covered
by
article
17
or
not?
all
you
have
to
say
is
something
happened
during
the
course
of
international
travel,
and
that's
the
end
of
the
ball
game
unless
there's
recovery
under
article
17.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
but
article
17
surely
is
relevant
to
deciding
whether
article
24
applies,
or
do
you
think
it's
not
relevant?
because
article
24(2)
says,
in...
starts
out
that
in
the
cases
covered
by
article
17
and
so
forth.
and
i...
when
i
see
something
like
that,
i
think,
well,
the
first
thing
i've
got
to
decide
is
whether
or
not
it's
covered
by
article
17,
and
i
think
you're
saying
it
doesn't
really
make
any
difference
whether
it's
covered
by
17.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i
still...
i'm
still
not
sure.
do
you
think
it
makes
any
difference
in...
to
your
case
whether
the
case
is
covered
by
article
17
or
not?
and
if
so,
is
it
or
is
it
not?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
you
haven't
answered
my
question.
is
it
covered
by
article
17
within
the
meaning
of
the
treaty?
justice
john
paul
stevens
this
case.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
is
covered
by
17.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
see.
justice
john
paul
stevens
see,
the
problem
i
have,
this
is...
i
want
to
get
it
on
the
table
so
you
have
an
opportunity
to...
is
that
if
you
say
the
universe
covered
by
article
17
is
all
cases,
it's
a
little
tension
with
the
language
of
article
17
which
describes
the
universe
of
cases
in
which
the
carrier
shall
be
liable.
but
you're
suggesting
article
17
also
covers
cases
in
which
the...
the
carrier
shall
not
be
liable.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
the
mere
fact
that
article
1
says
the
convention
shall
apply
doesn't
necessarily
mean...
maybe
it
did...
doesn't
necessarily
mean
it
shall
preempt
every
other
source
of
recovery.
it
just
doesn't...
in
plain
language,
it
doesn't
say
that.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
is
it
correct
that
the
conditions
for
liability
under
17,
as
you
view
the
treaty,
are
simply
physical
harm
and
being
in
the
course
of
international
travel?
there's
no
fault
requirement,
or
is
there
a
fault
requirement?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so,
the
only
conditions
you're
talking
about
is
somebody
got
hurt
while
he
was
on
an
airplane...
in
international
travel.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
silk,
does
that
mean
that
your...
your...
i'm
just
trying
to
think
this
thing
through...
response
to
justice
scalia
about
the
anomaly
is
that
there
is
total
preemption
of
state
law
causes
of
action
in
accident
cases
that
do
not
result
in
physical
harm?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so,
there
would
be...
a
category
of
common
law
causes
of
action
would
be...
would
be
preempted
by
the
treaty.
justice
john
paul
stevens
even
though
there's
no
recovery
in
those
cases.
