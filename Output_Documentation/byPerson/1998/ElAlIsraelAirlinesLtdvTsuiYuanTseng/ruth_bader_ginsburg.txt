justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
ms.
wilson,
it
might
help
if
you
gave
examples
of
what
has
been
considered
willful
misconduct.
a
very
recent
example
is
the
kal
case;
that
is,
it
is
an
accident,
but
the
conduct
was
found
by
a
jury
to
be...
to
amount
to
willful
misconduct.
so,
as
far
as
i
know,
the
cases
that
have
come
up
under
the
convention
involving
willful
misconduct
have
been
categorized
as
accidents,
and
then
the
question
is,
if
the
conduct
was
so
egregious,
the
limits
on
liability
are
off.
is
there
any
case
of
willful
misconduct
other
than
the
kal
pattern?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
do
i
understand
that
from
your
point
of
view
it
doesn't
matter?
if
this
were
an
accident,
then
the
district
court
said,
yes,
it's
an
accident,
but
there
was
no
bodily
injury.
end
of
case.
so,
you're
here
contesting
the
second
circuit
decision,
but
as
far
as
your
client
is
concerned,
categorization
of
an
accident...
as
an
accident
would
be
fine.
is
that--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
in
other
words,
you're
saying--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i'm
surprised
that
you
don't
put
weight
on
article
24
because
i
thought
it
was
that
article
that
clarifies
that
the
convention
is
meant
to
be
exclusive
for
these
categories,
personal
injury,
baggage
delay,
exclusive
of
any
other
actions
of
tort...
whatever
it
may
be.
and
you
don't
get
it
just
from
article
17
in
the
gestalt
of
the
convention,
but
you
have
an
exclusivity
article
written
right
into
the
convention.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
mr.
silk,
in
the
senate
report
on
what
the...
what
our
senate
voted
on,
it
says
in
the...
in
the
article
by
article
explanation
of
montreal
4,
it
says,
article
24
clarifies
that
any
action
for
damages,
whether
based
on
the
convention
or
in
contract
or
in
tort
or
otherwise,
can
only
be
brought
subject
to
the
conditions
and
limits
set
out
in
the
convention.
that's
this
august,
a
senate
report
saying
that
this
change
is
merely
clarifying.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so,
you
would
not
be
arguing--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
because
the...
article
17
requires
accident
plus
bodily
injury.
so,
you're
not
making
the
argument...
you
wouldn't
be
making
the
argument
that
even
if
this
were
an
accident,
it's
still
subject
to
state
law
because
there's
no
bodily
injury.
bodily
injury
is
all
that
the
convention
covers.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that
was
the
same
assumption
that
the
house
of
lords
made,
and
i
think
that
they
felt
a
certain
discomfort
in
that
too
because
they
said,
we
have
to
take
this
case
on
the
basis
that
it
was
no
accident.
it
wasn't
an
accident,
and
so
then
what
follows?
you
keep
characterizing
this
as
an
intentional
tort
and
clearly
not
an
accident,
and
yet
not
only...
was
it
judge
gleason?
there
was
another
earlier
case
involving
a
misfired
security
check,
and
district
judges
said,
yes,
that
sounds
like
an
accident
to
us.
they
went
through
their
routine
security
procedure.
they...
it
misfired
in
this
case.
the
profile
indicated
the
wrong
person.
why
is
it
so
clear
that
that
isn't
an
accident,
that
picking...
going
through
the
normal
procedures
but
having
the
procedure
misfire
isn't
an
accident?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
is
that
a
fact
question?
does
the
airline
dispute
that?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
thought
that
would
be
kind
of
something
to
which
the
airline
would
demur
in
the
district
court
because
the
airline's
case
in
the
district
court
was,
no
bodily
injury,
end
of
case.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
was
there
a
trial
in
this
case?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
a
trial.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
when
you
said
proved,
were
there
findings
of
fact?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
silk,
on
the
question
justice
o'connor
asked
earlier
in
the
argument,
is
there
any
precedent
from
other...
another
court
other
than
the
house
of
lords
that
interprets
article
17
in
context
of
article
24
in
context
of
the
whole
treaty?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
just
let
me
amend
the
word
to
be
decisions,
court
decisions.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
silk,
you
started
your
argument
by
saying
the
montreal
protocol
is
prospective.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
do
you
think
it
changes
anything
with
respect
to
a
case
like
yours?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
suppose
we
had
a
case
identical
to
yours
that
happens
today.
what
is
the
result?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
thank
you.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
question
is
whether
it's
something
new
or
whether
it's
clarifying.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so,
for
the
future,
there's
no
problem.
so,
you're...
you're
saying
that
your
case
is
one
of
these
prior
law
cases
and
there
are
too
many
of
them.
is
that
your
view?
