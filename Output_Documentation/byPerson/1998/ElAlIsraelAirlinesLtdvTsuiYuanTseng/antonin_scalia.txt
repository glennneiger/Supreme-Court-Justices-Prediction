justice
antonin
scalia
except
that
under
your
interpretation,
we
are
left
with
the...
with
the
surely
unusual
situation
in
which
if
there
is
a
willful
tort
committed
by
a
carrier,
so
long
as
it
is
not
an
accident,
there
is
no
recovery.
that's...
extraordinary.
justice
antonin
scalia
isn't
that
right?
i
mean,
isn't
that
the
consequence
of...
of
the
interpretation
you're
giving
to
the...
to
the
treaty?
justice
antonin
scalia
why
would
anyone
write
a
treaty
like
that?
i
mean--
justice
antonin
scalia
in
the
lockerbie
situation,
would
the...
would
the
carrier's...
let's
say
it
is
willful...
failure
to...
to
have
adequate
security
measures...
would
that
be
considered
an
accident
so
that
you
could
come
under
the
treaty?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
just
tell
me
your
view.
justice
antonin
scalia
would
that
be
an
accident?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
would
that
be...
was
that
an
accident
in
your
view?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
see.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
nuechtherlein,
do
you
know,
going
to
justice
stevens'
question,
i
think
we
would
have
less
trouble
with
article
17
if
instead
of
beginning,
the
carrier
shall
be
liable
for
damage
sustained
in
the
event
of
the
death
or
wounding
of
a
passenger
or
any
other
bodily
injury
suffered
by
a
passenger,
if
the
accident,
blah,
blah,
blah...
i
think
it
would
be
easier
to
sustain
your
case
if
it
read
instead,
in
the
event,
if
it
began
with
in
the
event
of
the
death
or
wounding
of
a
passenger
or
any
other
bodily
injury,
the
carrier
shall
be
liable
if.
because
then,
you
know,
the
introduction
says,
in
the
event
of
that's
the
situation
covered,
in
the
event
of
the
death
or
wounding.
do
you
happen
to
know
whether
the
french
version
of
the
treaty
is
structured
the
same
way?
does
it
begin,
the
carrier
shall
be
liable?
or
does
it
begin,
in
the
event
of
the
death
or
wounding
of
a
passenger?
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
the
core.
justice
antonin
scalia
how
many
smart
people
from
how
many
countries
came
up
with
this...
with
this
formulation?
[laughter]
you
think
they--
justice
antonin
scalia
--could
have
said
it
more
clearly.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
makes
perfect
sense.
now
the
question
is
whether
they
did
that
in
order
to
change
what
the
original
treaty
said
or
in
order
to
correct
or
to
make
more
clear
what
the
original
treaty
said.
how
do
we
know
that
it
was
in
order
to
make
it
more
clear?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
guess
your
position
is
the
treaty
meant
what
it
meant,
and
the
senate--
justice
antonin
scalia
--cannot,
by
later
saying
it
meant
something
else,
cause
it
to
have
meant
something
else.
it
either
meant
that
or
it
didn't
mean
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
seems
reasonable
to
me.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
you
must
admit
it
produces
results
that
make
the
whole
treaty
seem
quite
pointless.
i
mean,
the
whole
purpose
of
the
treaty
was
to
come
to
some
common
agreement
as
to
the
liability
of
carriers,
and
the...
and
the
agreement
that
you
say
they
signed
says
that
in
the
event
of
personal
injuries
in
the
narrow
situation
where
it's
caused
by
an
accident
and
there
is
physical
injury,
you
can
sue
under
the
convention
and
you're
limited,
and
in
all
other
situations,
you're
remanded
to
whatever
the
local
law
is
so
that
there
will
be
innumerable
divergent
judgments
in
all
sorts
of
different
jurisdictions.
justice
antonin
scalia
so,
your
answer
is
yes,
that's...
that's
a
result
and
too
bad.
but,
you
know,
i'm
not
inclined
to
interpret
it
that
way
if
i'm
dealing
with...
with
a
phrase
that
is...
is
merely
ambiguous,
in
the
cases
covered
by
article
17.
does
that
mean
in
the
cases
in
which
article
17
gives
relief,
or
does
it
mean
in...
in
the
cases...
in
the
cases
in
which...
which
article
17
addresses?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
sure,
but
why
can't
i
say
that
article
17...
what
it
addresses
is
damage
sustained
in
the
event
of
death
or
wounding
of
a
passenger
or
any
other
bodily
injury
suffered
by
a
passenger?
that,
it
seems
to
me,
is
the
general
subject
of
17.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
necessary
for
liability,
to
be
sure.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
do
you...
why
do
you
insist
that
only
the
necessity
of
an
accident
is
part
of
the...
of
the
limitation
in
17?
why
not
also
death,
wounding,
or
other
bodily
injury?
i
mean,
isn't
that
a
condition
just
as
much
as
the
existence
of
an...
of
an
accident?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
can--
justice
antonin
scalia
--i
can
also
say
the...
the...
the
accident
is
only
a
condition
if...
if
there's
death
or...
death
or
wounding
or
any
other
bodily
injury.
i
mean,
they're...
they're
parallel
conditions,
it
seems
to
me.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
right,
but
it
also...
it
also
only
predicated
liability
for
death
or
wounding
or
other
bodily
injury.
so,
you
could
say
it's
only
limited
to
that
too.
so,
if
it
isn't
death,
wounding,
or
bodily
injury,
if
it's
just...
just
psychic
injury,
even
in
the
event
of
an
accident,
you
can
sue
under
state
law.
justice
antonin
scalia
close
enough.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
know,
i...
i
wish...
i...
i
want
to
join...
was
it
justice
breyer
who
complained
about
the
fact
that
both
sides
are
arguing
all
different
sections
of
the
treaty,
and
the
only
ones
that
are
reproduced
in
the
materials
we
have
in
front
of
us
are
1,
17,
and
24.
i
don't
know
why
they...
it's
not
that
long
a
treaty.
the
whole
thing
could
have
been
reproduced
so
that
we
could
have
seen
it
in
its...
in
its
entirety.
i
really...
sure,
it's
in
the
united
states
code.
i
don't
have
the
united
states
code
at
home
when
i'm
reading
the
briefs.
i
assume
that
all
of
the
essential
materials
are
going
to
be
in
front
of
us.
justice
antonin
scalia
we're
talking
about
18.
we're
talking
about
a
lot
of
other
provisions,
and
i...
you
know,
that's
very
interesting.
where
do
i
look
them
up?
justice
antonin
scalia
--oh.
1,
17,
and
24
are
in
the
petitioner's
brief.
justice
antonin
scalia
at
the
beginning,
and
18
is
somewhere.
i'm
not
sure
where
it
is,
but--
justice
antonin
scalia
24(1)
uses
the
same
critical
phrase,
in
the
cases
covered
by,
in
the
english
version.
justice
antonin
scalia
right,
but
the
same
issue
would
arise.
does
in
the
cases
covered
by
mean
in
those
cases
where
there
is
liability
under
or
does
it
mean
in
the
universe
of
situations
envisioned
by?
and
these
cases,
as
justice
o'connor
suggests,
say
that
it
means
the
latter.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
about
18?
does
18
begin
the
same
way,
the
carrier
shall
be
liable
for
damage,
or
does
it
begin
differently?
we
don't
know.
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
in
the
united
states
code,
i
guess,
somewhere.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
we
should
just
leave
them
alone
and
stop
worrying
about
it
all.
right?
