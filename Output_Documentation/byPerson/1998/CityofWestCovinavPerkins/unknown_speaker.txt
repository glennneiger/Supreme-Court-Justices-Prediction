unknown
speaker
because
he
didn't
have
the
warrant
number.
and
i
was
wondering
why,
since
you...
as
you
stated,
you
provided
notice
that
there
had
been
the
seizure,
why
it
wouldn't
be
a
good
idea
simply
to
have
the
warrant
number
on
the
notice
that's
left
and
then
we
would
have
avoided
this
great
federal
case.
unknown
speaker
but
whether
that's
so
or
not,
it
would
make
it
easier
if
you
had
the
warrant
number
to
look
up.
unknown
speaker
well,
mr.
lawrence,
i...
that's
all
well
and
good
and
it
may
not
violate
the
constitution
to
do
what
the
city
did,
but
like
justice
ginsburg,
i
wonder
why
the
city
doesn't
want
to
help
its
citizens
by
giving
them
the
information
that
would
be
useful,
like
a
correct
warrant
number.
i
mean,
that's
very
easy
to
do,
and
the
city's
position
seems
very
peculiar.
oh,
go
bring
a
mandamus
action.
well,
that
takes
legal
help
and
all
kinds
of
stuff.
now,
why
doesn't
the
city
want
to
just
supply
some
simple
information?
unknown
speaker
but
if
you
have
the
number,
as
i
understand
it,
it's
the
federal
practice
they
leave
you
a
copy
of
the
warrant
so
you
have
it,
just
a
copy
of
the
warrant,
right
there.
unknown
speaker
all
it
takes
is
a
piece
of
carbon
paper
and
it
seems
so
simple
and
would
avoid
snafus
like
this.
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
that
the
ninth
circuit
in
this
case
erred
in
a
principle
of
law
that
it
stated
or
was
its
error
simply
an
improper
application
of
a
correct
principle
of
law?
unknown
speaker
and
what
was
that
error
of
law?
unknown
speaker
well,
is
notice
required
that
there
has
been
a
seizure?
unknown
speaker
does
the
state
have
to
give
notice
that
a
seizure
has
occurred?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
guess
we
could
turn
this
into
a
fourth
amendment
case.
it
would
seem
to
me
that
if
the
state
has
taken
your
property
for
any
reason,
in
circumstances
where
you
might
not
otherwise
know...
know
who
did
it,
that
the
state,
as
a...
as
a
minimum
requirement,
ought
to
say
that
we
took
your
property.
we
seized
your
bank
account.
we
entered
your
house.
we
bulldozed
your
tree
over.
unknown
speaker
but
even...
you
know,
even
where
you
realize
your
property
has
been
taken,
if
you
come
home
and
find
your
house
has
been
ransacked,
you
still
want
to
know
who
did
it.
unknown
speaker
well,
what
if
the
city...
if
it...
if
we
were
in
a
predeprivation
situation
and
the
city
wanted
to
take
property
of
the...
the
person,
the
citizen,
now
you
agree
that
due
process
would
require
giving
some
notice
to
the
person
of
the
state's
or
the
city's
intention
to
take
their
property.
unknown
speaker
well,
at
a
minimum,
the
state--
--now...
and...
and...
if
that's
the
case,
then
what
changes
in
the
postdeprivation
context?
unknown
speaker
but
maybe
some
notice
is
still
required
that
the
property
was
taken
and
who
took
it
and
when.
unknown
speaker
so,
then
the
principle
is
there
must
be
some
notice
which
gives
the
citizen
the
basis
for
proceeding
to
claim
the
property
that's
been
taken.
unknown
speaker
would
you
agree
with
that?
unknown
speaker
well,
whether
or
not
a
search,
it
would
be
unreasonable
to
take
it
under
any
context,
and
then
we're
back
in
the
fourteenth
amendment
not
to
search.
you
want
to
make
this
a
search
case.
your
certiorari
petition
talks
about
due
process,
and
that's
what
the...
the
ninth
circuit
talked
about.
and
i...
i
think
there's
a
substantial
likelihood
we're
going
to
write
the
opinion...
or
at
least
i
would
make
my
judgement...
based
on
the
due
process
clause.
unknown
speaker
and
i
want
to
know
what
the
minimum
principle
is.
the
minimum
principle
is,
it
seems
to
me,
you
have
to
give
notice
sufficient
to
the
citizen
so
that
the
citizen
can
ask
for
the
return
of
the
property.
and
if
that's
so,
then
the
only
error
the
ninth
circuit
made
was,
in
your
view,
an
over
application
or
an
improper
application
of
the
principle.
unknown
speaker
all
right.
why
do
you
draw
the
line
there?
you've
conceded
that
it
is
reasonable
for
due
process
purposes
to
require
at
least
an
identification
of
the
person
who
took
the
property
so
that
the
property
owner
doesn't
have
to
start,
in
effect,
searching
the
world
for...
for
the...
for
the
perpetrator.
why
isn't
it
equally
sensible
to
narrow
down
things
one
step
more
and
say
the
way
to
get
it
back
is
to
apply
to
the
judge
for
property
seized
under
warrant
number
x?
that
prevents
the
citizen
from
having
to
do
what
this
one
does
and
that
was
perhaps
not
very
efficiently,
but
basically
sort
of
go
from
pillar
to
post
and
saying
go
to
the
judge.
you
go
to
the
judge.
somebody
says,
well,
the
judge
isn't
there
and
you
can't
get
it
back
this
way.
nobody
ever
seems,
until
sort
of
the
final
act
here,
to
tell
him
just
how
to...
how
to
do
it.
why
not
then...
going
back
to
my
question,
why
not
then
say
fairness
requires
for
due
process
purposes
not
only
an
identification
of
the
perpetrator,
but
at
least
this
simple
bit
of
information
which
would
make
it
clerically
easy
to
do
what
you
have
a
right
to
do?
unknown
speaker
what
difference
does...
does
that
make?
they
can't...
they
can't
give
notice
to
someone
who
is
unidentified
to
them,
but
they
can
give
notice,
as
you
have
conceded
it
is...
it
is
fundamentally
reasonable
for
them
to
do,
to
the
person
from
whose
premises
the
property
is
taken.
if
therefore
that
is
a
sensible
due
process
result,
why
not
take
it
a
baby
step
further
and
say,
if
you
want
to
get
it
back,
use
this
number
and
ask
x?
unknown
speaker
i
was
talking
about
the
warrant
number
which
justice
ginsburg
and
justice
o'connor
spoke
of.
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
it's
up
to
you,
it
seems
to
me.
it's
up
to
the
government
to
decide
what
the
method
for
getting
the
property
back
is.
once
you've
decided
what
that
method
is,
go
to
the
judge,
go
to
the
police
department,
go
somewhere
else...
that's
your...
that's
your
choice,
but
once
you've
decided
it,
why
don't
you
give
the...
why
isn't
it
reasonable
to
expect
you
to
give
the
information
that
will
allow
the
person
to
take
an
efficient
first
step
as
opposed
to
running
the
risk
of
getting
this
kind
of
runaround?
unknown
speaker
mr.
lawrence,
may
i
ask
if
you
agree
with
the
proposition
that
appears
in
the
brief
filed
by
30
states?
and
it
says,
upon
seizing
respondent's
property
in
the
course
of
a
criminal
investigation,
due
process
required
the
city
to
provide
notice
reasonably
calculated
to
inform
the
residents
where
the
property
was
and
how
to
get
it
back.
would
you
say...
would
you
agree
that
that
is
the
proposition
of
law
and
the
question
in
this
case
is
how
to
apply
it,
or
do
you
disagree?
unknown
speaker
well,
it
depends
on
what
you
mean
by
notice,
doesn't
it?
i
mean,
you've...
if
the
way
to
get
it
back
is
mandamus
and
you
have
statutes
which
give
notice
to
the
entire
public
at
large,
you're
given
notice
of
how
to
get
it
back,
haven't
you?
unknown
speaker
the
public
statute
provides
the
notice.
does
the
state
have
any
obligation
to
provide
a
means
of
getting
it
back
short
of
suing
the
state
for
it?
unknown
speaker
so...
so,
what
we're
arguing
about
is
whether
the
state
has
to
leave
a
note
that
says,
sue
me--
unknown
speaker
--instead
of
having
public
statutes
that
provide
for
mandamus
actions.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
take
it
that
would
be
fairly
difficult
because
there
were
several...
there
was
not
just
one
remedy
under
california
law,
but
there
were
several
different
avenues
that
could
have
been
preferred.
so,
it
wasn't
just
a
question
of
you
could
pick
out
one
sentence
and
say...
if
you...
you're
certainly
not
going
to
decide
to
choose
yourself
among
the
remedies
that
the
state
has
provided.
unknown
speaker
mr.
lawrence,
can
i
ask?
because
i
think
when
one
responds
to
a
lot
of
different
questions
from
the
court,
you
sometimes
take
positions
that
are
not
entirely
consistent
with
one
another.
at
one
time
i
thought
you
had
conceded
to
the
chief
justice
the
constitution
did
require
some
notice,
but
that
this
notice
was
adequate,
and
other
times
you
seem
to
be
saying
the
constitution
does
not
require
any
notice.
which
is
your
position?
unknown
speaker
so,
your
position
is
no
notice
is
required
by
the
constitution.
unknown
speaker
well,
by...
excuse
me.
could
i
just
finish?
or
by
the
fourth
amendment?
is
there
any
constitutional
requirement
of
any
notice
in
your
view?
unknown
speaker
can
we
be
more
precise?
are
we
talking
about
notice
of
the
taking
of
the
property
or
notice
of
how
to
get
the
property
back?
unknown
speaker
are
we
talking
about
both?
unknown
speaker
that
was
my
question
to
you.
notice
as
to
who
had
taken
property
in
the
home
of
an
absent
property
owner.
unknown
speaker
reasonable
or
required?
unknown
speaker
because
i
think
you...
you
answered
me
before
that
it
would
be
reasonable
to
provide
the
warrant
notice,
but
not--
unknown
speaker
--well,
give
the
devil
its
due
here.
you...
you
concede
that
it
would
be
unreasonable
not
to
let
somebody
know
that
the
state
has
taken
his
property,
and
therefore
it
would
be
an
unreasonable
search
and
seizure
and
would
violate
the
first
amendment.
unknown
speaker
fourth
amendment.
unknown
speaker
if
you
did
not
let
them
know.
unknown
speaker
and
the
reason
for
drawing
the
line
between
that
fourth
amendment
position
and
the
due
process
position
that
you
take
i
assume
is
this,
but
correct
me
if
i'm
wrong.
it's
reasonable
under
the
fourth
amendment...
it
is
a
requirement
of
reasonableness
under
the
fourth
amendment
to
identify
the
perpetrator,
otherwise
the...
the
individual
has
no
idea
where
to
look,
whereas
it
is
not
a
requirement
of
reasonability
to
reveal
the
process
necessary
to
get
it
back
because
anyone
who
has
been
deprived
of
property
and
knows
the
state
deprived
him
of
it
can
look
up
the
law
and
find
out
how
to
do
it.
is
that
the
reason
you
draw
the
line?
unknown
speaker
very
well,
mr.
lawrence.
mr.
sutton,
we'll
hear
from
you.
unknown
speaker
excuse
me.
don't
the
officers
have
to
have
a
search
warrant
in
order
to
make
the
search?
unknown
speaker
in
order
to
have
the
search
warrant,
wouldn't
it
be
apparent
on
the
face
of
it
what
the
number
is?
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
it
would
be
easy
to
prepare
forms
that
have
numbers
on
them.
that
can't
be
the
that
can't
be
a
very
significant
due
process
fact.
well,
the
point,
justice
souter...
and
i
want
to
answer
your
question,
the
suggestion,
why
not
just
let
the
city
figure
out
a
procedure
and
then
align
all
of
its
notice
with
that
procedure
so
you
know
every
single
item
in
it.
and
the
point
i
would
like
to
make
is
that
in
a
criminal
investigation,
here
a
murder
investigation,
it's
not
that
easy.
in
order
to
do
it
correctly,
you
need
several
pages
of
forms
to
spell
out
each
of
the
different
rights
for
each
of
the
different
types
of
people
searched
and
the
different
types
of
remedies
they
might
have.
for
example,
there's
a
very...
very
big
difference
as
to
whether
an
indictment
has
been
charged.
the
city
of
west
covina,
the
record
shows
in
this
case,
tried
itself
to
get
the
property
back,
filed
a
1540
motion,
went
to
the
wrong
court.
they
went
to
judge
oki.
why
was
that
the
wrong
court?
by
then
an
indictment
had
been
filed,
a
murder
charge
against
mr.
marsh.
they
had
to
refile
it
again
in
the
california
superior
court
which
has
jurisdiction--
--mr.
sutton,
you're
making
this
seem
so
terribly
complex,
and
i
was
thinking,
well,
it
isn't...
whether
constitutionally
required,
it's
standard
operating
procedure
for
agencies,
say,
federal
agencies,
to
have
appeal
instructions.
so,
you
lost
and
they
give
you
a
little
statement,
about
five
lines,
that
tells
you
if
you
want
to
appeal
this,
this
is
what
you
do.
and
that...
that
is
done
routinely
without
having
these
horrendous
complications.
so,
i...
i...
you
could
make
it
so,
but
it
doesn't
have
to
be
that
way.
unknown
speaker
what
do
you
think
is
the...
is
the
basic
applicable
rule
here,
and
is
it
under
the
fourth
or
the
fourteenth
amendment?
unknown
speaker
all
right.
so,
under
the
fourteenth
amendment,
what
is
the
base
principle?
unknown
speaker
no
requirement
as
to
who
obtained
it?
unknown
speaker
i
still
would
like
to
know
what
the
basic
principle
is,
like
justice
kennedy.
unknown
speaker
well,
what
if
there
were
some
procedural
requirement
of
the
city
for
return
of
property
that
is
not
generally
known
because
it
isn't
a
matter
of
public
law?
the
city
requires
some
little
requirement
for
somebody
to
get
the
property
back,
but
you...
you
wouldn't
know
it
by
looking
at
the
law.
unknown
speaker
do
they
have
to
include
that
item?
unknown
speaker
well,
is
the
warrant
number
in
that
category,
do
you
think,
here?
unknown
speaker
do
you
think,
mr.
sutton,
that
it's
just
surplusage
or
worse,
pampering,
or...
to
have
these
standard
notices
that
tell
people
what
is
the
next
step
in
a
procedure
if
they
lose
at
one
stage?
that's
what
it...
that's
what
your
argument
sounds
like.
unknown
speaker
i
know
we
have
to
separate
those
two
things,
but
it
sounded
from
your
argument
like
you
were
going
way
beyond
that.
you
were
talking
about
good
citizens
should
read
the
statute
books
and
therefore
shouldn't
be
pampered,
indulged
by
telling
them
what
their
appeal
rights
are.
unknown
speaker
of
course,
it
didn't
work
out
in
this
case.
unknown
speaker
you're
not
retreating
in
any
way,
or
are
you,
from
this
brief
that
you
signed
that...
that
says
that
there
are
two
things
required
and
one
is
that
notice
and
the
other...
a
notice
reasonably
calculated
to
apprise
the
residents,
one,
where
the
property
was
and,
two,
whom
to
contact
about
its
return?
you're
not--
unknown
speaker
--but
that
is
the
minimum
constitutional
requirement.
unknown
speaker
why...
why
do
you...
why
do
you
concede
that
the
notice
of
the
person
whom
to
contact
is
required?
i
mean,
if...
if
you
give
them
notice
that
the
state
has
taken
their
property
on
the
reasoning
that
you
were
espousing
a
few
moments
ago,
why
isn't
it
enough
to
say
the
perkins
as
good
americans
should
be
able
to
figure
out
how
to
get
it
back?
unknown
speaker
thank
you,
mr.
sutton.
mr.
smith,
we'll
hear
from
you.
unknown
speaker
well,
now,
just
a
minute.
you...
you
make
that
assertion.
however,
the
trial
court
found
i
believe
that
there
is
no
evidence
either
way
about
whether
one
must
have
the
warrant
number
in
order
to
obtain
a
court
order
releasing
seized
property.
unknown
speaker
now,
the
court
specifically
made
that
finding.
unknown
speaker
well,
the
trial
court
said
that
perkins
was
given
all
the
information
he
needed
to
submit
an
informal
request
to
the
court
for
the
return
of
his
property,
and
that
having
the
address
of
where
the
property
was
taken
would
have
done
it.
now,
that
was
the
finding
of
the
court.
unknown
speaker
are
you
saying
the
district
court's
finding
was
wrong?
unknown
speaker
why
shouldn't
we
accept
it
whether
it's
binding
on
us
or
not?
there's...
certainly
a
district
judge
is
what
we
might
call
a
neutral
arbitrator
rather
than
either
of
the
parties
to
the
case.
unknown
speaker
the
family
all
went...
are
you
suggesting
the
family
all
went
together?
unknown
speaker
i
just
can't
believe
that
the
california
courts
would
say
no
ticket,
no
laundry.
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
they...
they...
they
would...
there
are
procedures
where
if
the
man
has
lost
the
search
warrant,
if
he
doesn't
know
the
number,
the
court
is
going
to
give
it
back
to
him.
unknown
speaker
everybody
knows
that.
unknown
speaker
well,
of
course,
in
many
cases
you
can't
get
the
property
back.
unknown
speaker
this
vicious
little
doctrine
of
custodia
legis
means
the
police
can
hold
onto
it
for
years,
if
they
need
it.
unknown
speaker
what
if
they
left
the
wrong...
the
wrong
warrant
number?
you
wouldn't
be
here.
you'd
say,
well--
unknown
speaker
--it
was
a
good
try.
unknown
speaker
at
least
they
tried
to
give
proper
notice
and
just
made
a
mistake.
unknown
speaker
if
they
did
and
gave
the
wrong
number--
unknown
speaker
--that
would
be
okay.
unknown
speaker
and...
but
isn't
there
a
procedure
in
place
here?
they...
they
went
down
to
the...
to
the
police
station
and
were
given
the
wrong
number
at
the
police
station
instead
of
being
given
the
wrong
number
at
their
house
when
the...
when
the
seizure
was
taken.
unknown
speaker
does
that
make
a
constitutional
difference?
unknown
speaker
but
so
what?
what
sent
this
case
awry
was
that
when
they
went
down
to
the
police
station,
they
were
given
the
wrong
number.
unknown
speaker
was
their
policy
to
give...
was
there
a
policy
to
give
people
the
wrong
number
when
they
went
to
the
police
station?
then
i
could
understand
how
you
might
have
some
problem.
but
it
seems
to
me
your
case
boils
down
to,
i
insist
upon
being
given
the
wrong
number
at
the
time
the
property
is
taken
rather
than
being
given
the
wrong
number
when
i
go
to
the
police
station.
unknown
speaker
mr.
smith,
just
to
narrow
this
controversy,
you
pointed
twice
in
your
brief
to
the
federal
rule
41(d)
as
a
model.
that
being
the
case,
then
you
must
also
agree
that
the
ninth
circuit
went
too
far.
unknown
speaker
the
ninth
circuit
went
considerably
beyond
rule
41(d)
in
what
it
required.
unknown
speaker
i'm
not
talking
about
the
standard.
i'm
talking
about
the
precise
instructions
that
the
ninth
circuit
gave.
they
said
everything
that
you
gave
him
on
the
form
that
was
left
and
in
addition...
and
that
was
not
talking
about
balancing
this,
that,
or
the
other
thing...
specific
items
that
were
supposed
to
be
included.
the
ninth
circuit
said
this
notice
is
deficient
because
specific
things
have
to
be
added
to
it,
and
i
don't
see
any
of
those
specific
things
in
rule
41(d).
unknown
speaker
i
don't
see
why
mullane
should
be
the
standard
here,
mr.
smith.
it
seems
to
me
that
mullane
is
a
predeprivation
situation,
what
kind
of
notice
you
have
to
give
prior
to
deprivation,
not
a
postdeprivation
at
all.
unknown
speaker
do
you
agree
with
that
or
not?
unknown
speaker
predeprivation.
unknown
speaker
then
why...
why
should
it
be
applicable
here?
unknown
speaker
so,
you
say
there
really
is
no
difference
between
predeprivation
and
postdeprivation.
unknown
speaker
well,
let
me
just
question
that
this...
with
this
example.
supposing
you're
parked
in
a
no
parking
zone,
and
the
police
come
along
and
haul
your
car
away
to
the...
to
some
lot.
do
they
have
to
give
you
notice
that
they've
done
it?
unknown
speaker
what's
the
difference?
unknown
speaker
and
you
call
the
police
and
ask
what
happened
to
the
car,
and
they'll
tell
you.
why
isn't
that
the
same
remedy
if
somebody
breaks
into
your
house
and
a
lot
of
stuff
is
rummaged
around?
why
don't
you
just
call
the
police
and
they'll
tell
you
they
were
the
ones
who
did
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
but
he
had
his
address.
he
had
his
address.
and
is
it
the
case
that
the
clerk
could
have
found
the
search
warrant
based
on
the
home
address?
unknown
speaker
there's
something
in
the
record
to
the
effect
that
that's
the--
unknown
speaker
--well,
but
the
district
court
was
very
clear.
it
said
perkins...
the
plaintiffs
want
the
court
simply
to
assume...
this
is
at
e6
of
the
petition
for
the
writ
of
certiorari.
plaintiffs
want
the
court
simply
to
assume
that
if
perkins
had
filed
a
request
with
the
court,
it
would
have
been
denied
because
he
did
not
have
the
warrant
number.
there
is
no
evidence
to
support
that
speculation.
unknown
speaker
they
knew
where
the
court
was.
they
went
to
the
courthouse.
unknown
speaker
suppose
mr.
perkins
was...
was
driving
his
car
and
he
was
struck
by
a...
by
a
vehicle
belonging
to
the
city
of
west
covina.
and
he
jumps
out
of
the
car
and
goes
to
the
driver
and
he
says,
you've
struck
my
car
and...
and
damaged
my
property.
you
owe
me
compensation.
the
driver
says,
you
know,
i'm...
i'm
the
city
of
west
covina.
we're
self
insurers.
we
don't
have
an
insurance
company.
what...
what
other
information
does
the
driver
have
to
provide?
unknown
speaker
other
than...
other
than
sue
me.
unknown
speaker
well,
why
is
that
different?
unknown
speaker
you
know...
you
know
who's...
who's
harmed
you,
who's
taken
your
property.
you
know
there's
a
system
of
law
for...
for
getting
compensated.
does
the
city
have
to
provide
you
with...
with
legal
advice?
unknown
speaker
that's
what
we're
talking
about.
unknown
speaker
that...
that
can
all
be
determined
in
court
just
the
way
the
extent
of
the
damage
to
his
vehicle--
unknown
speaker
--and
who
did
it
can
be
determined
in
court.
i
don't
see
that
there's
any
difference
between
the
two
cases.
unknown
speaker
but
the
district
court
said
he
didn't
need
it.
unknown
speaker
you
keep
asserting
that,
and
yet
several
of
us
have
pointed
out
from
the
bench
the
district
court
said
that
he
had
not
proved
that
he
needed
it.
unknown
speaker
what
do
you
mean
he
couldn't
get
into
court?
i
cannot
believe
it.
he
could
not
bring
a
lawsuit?
unknown
speaker
you're
thrown
out
of
court
because
you
don't
have
a
number?
unknown
speaker
well,
that's
your
denial
of
due
process
then.
you
can't...
you
can't
bring
a
suit
to
get
your
money
back
without
a
magic
number.
that's
clearly
a
denial
of
due
process.
now,
if
you
had
come
here
with
that
complaint,
i'd
be
more
sympathetic.
unknown
speaker
what
is
your
principle?
that
whenever
the
state
takes
property,
it
must...
it
must
do
all
those
things
that
are
reasonable
to
make
it
easy
to
get
the
property
back.
unknown
speaker
is
that
the
constitutional
principle?
unknown
speaker
an
otherwise
adequate
state
remedy
could...
could
be
limited
to
suing
in
court.
is
that
right?
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
if
that...
is
it
your
position
that
if
that
procedure
has
been
frustrated
by,
for
example,
the
failure
to
provide
the
warrant
number,
there
is
no
other
procedure
under
california
law
whereby
this...
this
property
could
have
been
recovered?
unknown
speaker
and
that's
a
constitutional
violation
even
though
there
is
another
way
to
get
your
property
back.
unknown
speaker
well,
but
mr.--
--may
i
ask
about
those
keys?
because
maybe
i'm
misunderstanding
the
facts
but
i
thought
that
on
the
side
of
the
police,
if
they
gave
the
warrant
number,
that
would
do.
on
the
side
of
mr.
perkins,
if
he
had
just
said,
here's
my
address,
that
that
would
have
done.
so,
we're
talking
about
just
one
further
step
on
either
side,
and
the
key...
the
door
would
have
been
unlocked.
unknown
speaker
but
he
knows
his
address.
unknown
speaker
and
so,
you're
saying
we...
there's
something
wrong
about
my
understanding
of
this
case,
that
if
he
had
provided
his
address,
then
the
warrant
would
have
been
found?
unknown
speaker
but
you
are
arguing
about
the
ineffectiveness
of
a
procedure
which
you
didn't
invoke.
unknown
speaker
you
did
not
go
to
the
court.
you
went
to
the
courthouse,
but
not
to
the
court.
unknown
speaker
and
it
seems
to
me
that
ends
your
case.
unknown
speaker
mr.
smith,
may
i
ask
perhaps
an
unfair
question,
but
supposing
instead
of
trying
to
do
all
this
himself,
he'd
come
to
you
and
said,
they
took
my
property.
how
long
do
you
think
it
would
have
taken
you
to
get
the
property
back?
unknown
speaker
really?
unknown
speaker
you
think
he
was
just
as
effective
in
getting
his
property
back
as
you
would
have
been
in
the
same
circumstances.
unknown
speaker
no,
but
i
thought
you
just
conceded
in
the
earlier
part
of
your
answer
to
justice
stevens
that
if
you
had
been
doing
it,
i
think
the
way
you
put
it,
i
might
have
filed
a
writ
of
mandate.
i
might
have
filed...
i
take
it
you
mean
by
that...
a
document
with
the
court
saying,
look,
i
need
a
number
in
order
to
get
my
client's
property
back.
they
haven't
given
me
the
number.
i
presume
you
would
have
gotten
some
relief
if
you
had
filed
that.
and
if
that
is
so,
why
really
isn't
that
the
end
of
your
case?
unknown
speaker
well,
we
don't
know
whether
you
would
have
gotten
the
number
or
not,
but
i
think
aren't
we
entitled
to
assume,
in
the
absence
of
a
demonstration
to
the
contrary,
that
the
court
would
have
done
something
other
than
throw
you
out
and
say
i'm
not
going
to
help
you.
too
bad.
unknown
speaker
well,
the
document
i
presume...
and
you
correct
me
if
i'm
wrong...
is
under
the
control
of
the
court,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
okay.
so,
if
you...
you
admit
that...
that
there
is
a
procedure
whereby
you
could
have
gone...
you
could
have
addressed
the
court
with
a
pleading
and
said,
i
need
this
number
that
you
have
in
order
to
get
back
property
that
they
took
from
me
that
they're
not
entitled
to
keep.
and
in
the
absence
of
some
demonstration
that
you
would
have
been
turned
away
arbitrarily,
we
have
to
assume,
i
think,
that
there
is
a
process
by
which
you
could
have
gotten
what
you
wanted,
and
ultimately
you
would
have...
your
client
would
have
gotten
the
property
back.
and
if
that
is
so,
i
don't
understand
what
the
premise
would
be
for
constructing
a
due
process
right
to
an
alternative
to
that.
unknown
speaker
well,
that's
one...
that's
one
way
of...
of
stating
the
conclusion,
but
i
would
have
thought
that
what
you
have
to
demonstrated
to
get
the
due
process
right
that
you
claim
is
that
it
is
fundamentally
unfair
for
the
state
to
take
the
property,
telling
you
that
it
is
they,
the
state,
that
have
taken
it,
and
then
leave
it
to
you
to
figure
out
what
the
procedure
under
state
law
is
for
its
return.
is
that
fundamentally
unfair?
unknown
speaker
it's
fundamentally
unfair
in
a
case
in
which
there
has
been
perhaps
a...
a...
a
negligent
runaround,
as
occurred
here.
it's
fundamentally
unfair
in
your
view
to
require
the...
the
property
owner
to
address
the
court
with
a
mandamus
petition
saying
give
me
what
i
need
to
know
in
order
to
get
the
property
back?
that
is
fundamentally
unfair?
unknown
speaker
but
we
don't
see
any
kind
of
abuse
of
that
discretion,
if
it
was
that,
because
the...
the
police
officer
did
say
the
property
is
in...
in
the
court's
custody,
so
you
have
to
go
there
to
get
it.
so,
it
wasn't
any
misleading
by
the
police
except
with
respect
to
this
number.
unknown
speaker
would
we...
would
it
have
been
okay
if
they
gave
him
the
warrant
number
and
it
was
the
city's
policy
to
give
him
the
warrant
number
not
at
the
time
a
warrant
is
left,
but
rather
at
the
police
station
when
he
comes
to
the
police
station?
unknown
speaker
that
would
be
fine.
unknown
speaker
well,
but
that
was
done
here,
only
they
gave
him
the
wrong
warrant
number.
unknown
speaker
but
mr.
perkins
thought
he
got
a
number.
and
he
thought
he
got
a
number
and
he
said
it
was
the
wrong
one.
unknown
speaker
if
you
have
given
us
such
a...
you
know,
examples
often
work
more
forcibly
on
the
mind
than
precepts,
and
you
have
given
us
the
example
of
41(d).
so,
why
are
we
talking
nebulously
about
not
using
balancing
and
all
that
when
we
have
a
concrete
example
of
what
you
say
here's
what
does
it,
here's
adequate
notice?
unknown
speaker
and
it's
a
very
simple.
it's
a
copy
of
the
warrant.
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
some
of
these
search
warrants
are
sealed.
certainly
the
affidavits
are.
it
may
well
have
been
that
if
this
murder
investigation
is
still
underway,
he's
not
entitled
to
the
property
back.
unknown
speaker
i
mean,
we
don't
know--
unknown
speaker
--thank
you
very
much,
mr.
smith.
mr.
lawrence,
you
have
2
minutes
remaining.
