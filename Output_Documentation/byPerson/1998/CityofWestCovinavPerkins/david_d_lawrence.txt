mr.
david
d.
lawrence
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court--
this
case
involves
the
valid
service
of
a
search
warrant
and
murder
investigation
in
which
the
west
covina
police
department
lawfully
seized
17
items
of
property
which
they
believed
were
evidence
in
that
investigation.
the
residents
of
the
home,
the
respondents
in
this
case,
were
not
at
home
when
the
home
was
searched.
the
officers
left
a
notification
of
the
search
which
provided
a
great
deal
of
information.
it
stated
that
the
home
had
been
searched.
it
set
forth
the
date
of
the
search.
it
provided
that
the
search
warrant
was
issued
pursuant
to
the
authority
of
the
citrus
municipal
court.
it
identified
the
judge,
judge
oki,
who
had
signed
the
search
warrant.
it
identified
two
west
covina
police
officers
and
their
telephone
numbers
who
could
be
contacted
if
the
owners
of
the
property
had
inquiries,
and
it
set
forth
a
specific
list
of
the
17
items
of
property
which
had
been
seized.
under
california
law,
these
police
officers
did
not
have
the
discretion
to
release
that
property
once
it
had
been
seized.
penal
code
section
1536
required
that
they
maintain
custody
of
that
property
subject
to
an
order
of
the
court.
shortly
after
seizure
of
this
property,
one
of
the
respondents,
mr.
perkins,
contacted
the
west
covina
police
department
and
advised
that
he
was
interested
in
obtaining
return
of
some
of
that
property.
the
record
is
undisputed
that
when
he
made
that
call
and
when
he
contacted
those
officers,
that
he
was
advised
that
he
would
need
to
get
a
court
order
to
get
that
property
back.
the
record
is
also
undisputed
that
he
was
advised
that
he
would
have
to
contact
judge
oki
in
order
to
do
so.
the
record
is
also
undisputed
that
at
most
the
respondent,
mr.
perkins,
went
to
the
citrus
municipal
court
on
one
occasion,
approximately
1
month
after
the
seizure
of
the
property.
the
record
shows
that
he
asked
for
judge
oki.
he
was
advised
that
judge
oki
was
on
vacation
and
might
be
back
in
a
week,
and
he
said
that
he
attempted
to
find
another
judge
who
could
release
his
property.
he
was
told
that
there
was
no
file
in
his
name
and
that
another
judge
could
not
do
that.
the
record
is
also
undisputed
that
he
took
no
further
actions
to
obtain
return
of
that
property.
mr.
david
d.
lawrence
justice
ginsburg,
i
don't
believe
the
record
is
clear
that
the
warrant
number
or
the
absence
of
it
really
prevented
the
respondents
from
obtaining
the
return
of
the
property.
mr.
david
d.
lawrence
it
might.
it
might,
but
the
record
is
really
bare
as
to
what
those
procedures
were
at
the
municipal
court
in
terms
of
locating
a
file
or
something
of
that
nature.
and
in
fact,
as
we
submitted,
one
of
the
postdeprivation
remedies
the
ninth
circuit
found
to
be
adequate
in
this
case
is
the
procedure
of
mandamus.
certainly
a
search
warrant
is
not
necessary
for
that.
mandamus
is
a
proceeding
that
compels
a
public
officer
like
a
judge
to
do
their
duty.
penal
code
section
1540
imposes
upon
judges
who
issue
search
warrants
the
obligation
of
returning
property
to
those
people
if
it
has
been
taken
without
probable
cause
or
is
not
the
property
identified
in
the
warrant.
a
mandamus
proceeding
provided
all
the
process
that
was
due
to
the
respondents
in
this
case
because
they
knew
the
name
of
the
judge.
they
knew
the
courthouse.
they
knew
the
property
that...
that--
mr.
david
d.
lawrence
--your
honor,
the
record
does
not
show
that
it
is
a
policy
of
the
city
not
to
provide
a
search
warrant
number.
the
record
in
this
case
is
unclear.
detective
ferrari
in
one
part
of
the
record
said
that
he
believed
he
did
not
give
the
warrant
number.
in
another
part
of
the
record,
he
said
that
he
did.
in
fact,
mr.
perkins
in
his
deposition
testified
that
he
was
given
a
number,
but
he
felt
that
it
was
the
wrong
number.
the
record
is
really
unclear
as
to
what
number
was
given
to
mr.
perkins
and
whether
he
received
it
or
not.
mr.
david
d.
lawrence
that's
correct.
the--
mr.
david
d.
lawrence
--but,
your
honor,
the
record
also
shows
that
the
warrant
number
was
not
the
only
way
to
access
that
information
at
the
courthouse.
the
record
shows
that
the
information
was
listed
not
only
by
the
warrant
number,
but
by
the
address
where
the
search
took
place
and
by
the
date
of
the
return.
and
the
respondents
had
both
of
those
pieces
of
information.
so,
maybe
the
warrant
number
would
have
assisted
the
respondents
in
getting
their
property
back,
but
the
record
also
shows
that
even
after
they
were
provided
with
that
information
as
early
as
january
of
1994,
they
did
nothing
to
get
their
property
back.
mr.
david
d.
lawrence
i
believe
it
was
an
error
of
law.
mr.
david
d.
lawrence
the
error
of
law
is
that
notice
is
required
in
the
postdeprivation
parratt
hudson
context.
there
is
no
authority
for
that
proposition.
the
ninth
circuit--
mr.
david
d.
lawrence
--pardon
me?
mr.
david
d.
lawrence
that's
one
of
the
issues
in
our
brief.
i
believe
that
the
fourth
amendment,
in
order
for
the
search
to
be
reasonable,
that
there
has
to
be
notice
of
a
search.
and
i
think--
mr.
david
d.
lawrence
--i
agree
that
there
are...
there
are
cases
where
a
person
might
be
unaware
that
a
property
right
has
been
affected
and
that
some
sort
of
notice
in
that
context
might
be
appropriate.
i
submit
that
that
is
not
the
kind
of
notice
that
this
court
has
spoken
of.
mr.
david
d.
lawrence
absolutely.
i
agree
with
that.
and
that--
mr.
david
d.
lawrence
--generally
i
would
agree.
it
would
depend
on
the
circumstances.
due
process
is
a
flexible
concept.
but
if
it's
not
impracticable,
yes.
then
the
state
does
need
to
give
notice
and
an
opportunity
to
be
heard
before--
mr.
david
d.
lawrence
--in
the
postdeprivation
context,
the
mathews
v.
eldridge
balancing
test
has
already
taken
place.
in
the
search
warrant
context,
the
predeprivation
process
is
not
practicable.
for
one--
mr.
david
d.
lawrence
--and
there
was
that
notice
provided
in
this
case.
mr.
david
d.
lawrence
i
think--
mr.
david
d.
lawrence
--i
think
in
a
case
like
our
case
where
they
weren't
home,
that
it
would
be
unreasonable
to
go
into
the
home
to
search,
to
take
items
of
property,
and
to
leave--
mr.
david
d.
lawrence
--i
understand.
mr.
david
d.
lawrence
if
this
court
views
that
sort
of
notice,
that
factual
notice,
that
a
search
has
taken
place
and
that
the
property
has
been
seized
as
due
process
notice,
then
i
agree,
and
i
submit
that
the
notice
that
was
provided
in
this
case
is
certainly
adequate.
mr.
david
d.
lawrence
because,
justice
souter,
that...
that
analysis
looks
at
the
facts
of
the
case
in
a
post
hoc
basis.
in
this
case
we
know...
or
at
least
we
assumed
that
the
owner
of
the
property
was
mr.
perkins,
but
when
the
search
occurs,
like
in
this
case,
the
officers
don't
know
who
owns
that
property.
they
don't
know--
mr.
david
d.
lawrence
--well,
if...
if
you're
talking
about
simply
providing
a
telephone
number
to
call
somebody--
mr.
david
d.
lawrence
--the
reason
is
that
there
are
a
variety
of
methods
for
getting
that
property
back,
and
whether
one
can
get
it
back
in
the
method
that
one
follows
depends
on--
mr.
david
d.
lawrence
--for
example,
if
there
is
a
prosecution,
there
is
a
penal
code
section
1538.5,
and
if
the
court
looked
at
that,
it
is
a
tremendously
lengthy
statute
and
whether
one
can
get
the
property
back--
mr.
david
d.
lawrence
--i
disagree.
on
the
portion
of
how
to
get
it
back,
that
is
legal
advice
that
this
court
has
never
required.
this
court--
mr.
david
d.
lawrence
--the
public
statute
provides
for
notice,
yes.
mr.
david
d.
lawrence
i
don't
believe
it
does.
mr.
david
d.
lawrence
exactly.
mr.
david
d.
lawrence
a
suit
that
says,
sue
me
and
here's
how
to
do
it.
mr.
david
d.
lawrence
that's
correct,
your
honor.
there
were
a
variety
of
remedies
that
these
respondents
could
have
used,
and
there
were
a
variety
of
other
remedies
that
persons
in
situations
slightly
different
than
those
in
which
the
respondents
were
in--
mr.
david
d.
lawrence
--what
i'm
saying
is
that
the
fourteenth
amendment
due
process
clause
does
not
provide
a
requirement
of
notice
in
this
postdeprivation
context.
mr.
david
d.
lawrence
not...
not
by
the
fourteenth
amendment--
mr.
david
d.
lawrence
--i
believe
the
fourth
amendment,
in
the
context
of
a
surreptitious
search,
requires
that
some
sort
of
notice
be
provided,
and
that
would...
that
makes
the...
the
seizure
and
the
search
reasonable.
mr.
david
d.
lawrence
notice--
mr.
david
d.
lawrence
--notice
that
the
search
has
been
taken
and
what
has
been
taken.
mr.
david
d.
lawrence
right,
and
i
think...
i
think
it...
it
is
reasonable
under
the
fourth
amendment
for
the
police
to
at
least
advise
the
absent
homeowner
that
they
have
been
there,
searched--
mr.
david
d.
lawrence
--i
believe
it's
required--
mr.
david
d.
lawrence
--there
are
situations
in
which
it
would
not
be
required
because
there
are
things
such
as
sneak
and
peak
warrants.
so,
i
cannot
say
in
all
cases
that
the
fourth
amendment
requires
that
notice.
mr.
david
d.
lawrence
the
fourth
amendment,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
david
d.
lawrence
correct.
mr.
david
d.
lawrence
yes.
mr.
david
d.
lawrence
yes,
justice
souter,
i
agree
with
that.
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
david
d.
lawrence
if
i
could
make
a
couple
of
points.
one,
my
opposing
counsel
states
that
all
of
us
agree
that
mullane
is
the
proper
test
here.
we
do
not
agree
that
mullane
is
the
proper
test.
mullane
is
a
predeprivation
case.
that's
a
test
that's
applied
to
determine
whether
or
not
notice
is
sufficient
in
the
predeprivation
context.
further,
in
that
case,
the
court
stated
that
notice
is
a
necessary
element
of
due
process
when
there
is
a
final
adjudication,
and
the
notice
is
to
give
the
person
whose
property
rights
are
at
issue
an
opportunity
to
appear
and
to
contest
that
hearing
or
to
choose
not
to
appear.
that
is
not
the
case
here
because
we
did
not
have
a
final
adjudication
or
a
hearing
that
notice
could
be
given
up.
my
opposing
counsel
states
that
they
did
not
get
the
property
back
or
they
could
not
get
the
property
because
they
did
not
get
it,
and
the
record
shows
that
even
after
receiving
the
search
warrant
number
and
even
after
getting
advice
of
counsel,
myself,
as
to
how
to
get
it
back,
they
did
nothing
to
get
it
back.
so,
i
submit
that
that's
not
a
very
good
test
to
determine
whether
or
not
it
was
possible
for
counsel
or
the
respondents
to
obtain
the
return
of
their
property.
thank
you.
