mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court--
i'd...
like
to
ask...
answer
the
hardest
question
first
raised
by
justice
o'connor
and
justice
souter
and
justice
ginsburg.
why
not
just
do
it?
why
not
just
put
the
darned
search
warrant
number
on
the
search?
it
would
have
solved
their
problems.
well,
first
of
all,
that's
not
an
answer
that
would
solve
the
problems
throughout
this
country
in
every
city,
county,
and
state.
ohio
is
a
good
example.
they
don't
even
know
the
search
warrant
number
at
the
time
they
do
the
search.
the
reason
is
they
figure
out
the
search
warrant
when
they
come
back
and
file
the
return
of
service.
secondly,
it
wouldn't
even
have
made
a
difference
in
this
case.
the
problem
is--
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
--absolutely,
your
honor,
and
i
hope
i
didn't
misspeak.
what
i'm
saying
is
that
the
search
warrant
number
was
the
missing
piece
of
information
here,
and
i'm
saying
in
many--
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
--no,
that's
what
i'm
saying.
many
states,
ohio
being
one,
don't
even
have
a
search
warrant
number
at
the
time
of
the
search.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
justice
ginsburg,
i
would
submit
that
the
process
and
the
policy
that
is
under
attack
here
would
have
worked
fine,
but
in
this
case
the
problem
that
west
covina
had
and
the
perkins
had
was
not
the
policy.
the
problem
was
misadvice
by
employees
of
the
west
covina
municipal
court
and
the
police
department.
no
policy
is
going
to
anticipate
every
blunder
by
a
city
employee
in
every
city
and
county
and
state
in
this
country.
the
policy
would
have
worked
fine--
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
--if
i
could
answer
the
second
question
first.
i
would
submit
it
is
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
due
process,
and
one
hypothetical
i
think
proves
it.
if
you
look
at
the
facts
of
parratt,
you've
got
a
prisoner.
fourth
amendment
rights
don't
always
apply
in
the
prison
setting.
let's
assume
it
doesn't
apply.
let's
say
the
prison
warden
comes
into
the
individual's...
the
chambers,
takes
something
for
some
legitimate
reason,
doesn't
leave
any
notice
as
to
what
has
been
done.
that
inmate
has
no
fourth
amendment
right,
let's
assume
for
the
purposes
of
this
hypothetical,
but
yet
the
state
would
have
a
burden
to
let
the
individual
know
they'd
taken
something.
and
that's
why
i
think
it
really
does
have
to
be
procedural
due
process.
it
may
be
both.
as
sodall
indicates,
that
they're
not
always
mutually
exclusive.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
the
principle
is
this,
your
honor.
one,
you
have
got
to
give
notice
under
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fact
of
injury,
and
here
there
was
actual
notice
of
the
fact
of
injury.
that's
exactly
what
the
search
warrant
notice
told
them.
at
that
point
in
time,
we've
got
two
relevant
traditions
that
i
think
inform
the
answer
to
this
case.
the
first
tradition.
since
1868--
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
--oh,
i'm
sorry.
i...
i
spoke
too
quickly,
your
honor.
you're
right.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
the...
the
basic
principle
is
that
you've
got
to
tell
them
the
fact
of
the
search,
what
was
taken,
and
who
took
it.
i
would
submit
west
covina
went
further
here
by
giving
information
about
courts
and
all
the
detectives.
i
would
say
at
a
bare
minimum,
the
rule
is
you
need
to
let
them
know
there's
been
a
deprivation,
who
was
responsible,
and
i
think
the
inventory
does
have
to
identify
each
piece
of
property
taken.
at
that
point
i
would
submit
there's
inquiry
notice,
which
would
trust
every
citizen
in
this
country
to
figure
out
for
themselves
as
to
what
rights
or
remedies
they
may
have.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
your
honor,
that's--
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
--that's
memphis
light,
and
yes,
you
would
be
under
that
burden.
memphis
light
was
a
great
example
of
that
point
where
the
internal
dispute
resolution
procedure
provided
by
the
utility
was
only
known
by
the
utility,
not
the
public
or
not
the
customers
of
the
utility.
that's
like
the
roman
emperor
that
printed
the
laws
in
such
fine
type
and
so
high
on
the
wall
that
no
one
could
figure
them
out.
there
you
would
have
to
give
notice.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
no,
your
honor,
because
that's
not
all
you
need.
you
also
need
to
know
the
property
address
which
surely
the
residents,
the
perkinses,
knew.
it
was
their
property.
i
would
submit
all
you
needed
in
this
case
was
a
written
motion
filed
at
the
court.
and
that
goes
to
another
problem
with
this
case
fundamentally,
and
that's
not
the
notice.
it's
the
type
of
procedure
required
in
order
to
get
the
property
back.
california
law
required
a
court
order.
it
makes
sense
to
require
a
court
order.
we
want
to
make
sure
that
the
property
gets
back
to
its
rightful
owners,
and
we
want
to
make
sure
that
a
legitimate
criminal
investigation
is
not
interrupted.
it
makes
good
sense
to
give
an
awful
lot
of
process
in
that
setting,
and
i
think
that...
that
justifies
this.
it
also
seems
paradoxical
in
the
1990's
to
abandon
a
long
tradition
in
this
country
that
when
people
know
they
have
been
injured,
they've
got
the
good
sense
to
figure
out
what
their
rights
and
remedies
are.
rich
or
poor,
meek
or
brazen,
smart
or
not
so
smart,
we
americans
are
finding
ways
to
get
to
the
courthouse
and
certainly
doing
it
in
the
1990's
in
droves.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
well,
your
honor,
i'm
not
here
to
say
that
if
it
takes
too
much
work,
the
government
doesn't
want
to
do
it.
i'll
be
fired
the
next
day
if
i
ever
made
that
statement
in
public.
that's
not
the
point.
i
think
the
question
is
what
the
constitution
requires.
i...
i
think
democracy
requires
some
leap
of
faith
here
and--
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
--well,
west
covina
is
certainly
entitled
to
do
that.
i
just...
i
think
what
this
court's
cases
suggest
is
that
it's
condescending
to
require
it.
there...
there...
we...
i
don't
think
we
need
to
make
the
assumption
that
the
perkinses
can't
figure
out
what
their
legal
rights
and
remedies
are.
they
knew
they
had
been
injured.
it
doesn't
take
intelligence
or
money
to
get
a
remedy.
it
just
takes
an
interest
in
self
protection,
and
if
someone
doesn't
have
that,
i
think
the
rule
of
due
process
i
propose
is
going
to
be
the
least
of
their
worries.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
it
didn't
work
out
in
this
case,
and
justice
stevens,
the
reason
it
didn't
work
out
in
this
case
was
the
alleged
misfeasance
and
negligence
of
certain
court
employees
and
the
bad
luck
that
judge
oki
happened
to
be
on
vacation
the
day
they
went
down
to
the
courthouse.
but
i
would
submit
each
time
a
judge
takes
a
vacation,
each
time
an
employee
gives
poor
advice...
and
poor
advice
was
given
here...
that
doesn't
state
a
due
process
claim
and
certainly
doesn't
state
a
1983
claim.
that
strikes
me
as
the
heart
of
this
matter,
and
i
don't
think
there's
any
policy
for
monell
purposes
that
a
city,
state,
or
county
could
put
together
that
would
anticipate
each
of
the
problems
that
led
to
the
perkinses'
plight.
and
i
think
the
tradition
here
is
relevant.
i
mean,
we've
been
having
searches
and
seizures
since
long
before
1868.
there's
no
custom
nor
any
statute
that
i'm
aware
of
from
then
to
the
present,
at
least
prior
to
this
decision,
in
which
a
city,
county,
or
state
has
required
the
police
not
only
to
inform
them
of
the
fact
of
the
seizure,
but
them
to
inform
them
of
their
rights,
for
example,
a
right
under
the
fourth
amendment
or
a
right
to
get
the
property
back.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
i'm
not
because
that's
what...
that
happened
here.
i
mean,
if...
it's
true--
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
--absolutely,
absolutely.
and
that
was--
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
--well,
i
may
not
have
spoke
as
clearly
as
i
should
have,
and
i
think
i
made
the
same
mistake
in
responding
to
a
question
by
justice
o'connor.
but
the
question
is
you've
got
to...
you've
got
to
make
sure
that
the
notice
is
enough
to
let
them
know
the
fact
of
the
property
seizure
and
who
did
it.
if
you
know
who
did
it,
you
know
how
to
get...
get
it
back.
thank
you.
