mr.
patrick
s.
smith
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court--
with
regard
to
this
fundamental
question,
what
is
the
proper
standard
by
which
this
court
should
judge
this
case,
i
think
it's
important
to
understand
two
things.
the
first
is,
is
that
in
this
case
the
search
warrant
number
was
an
absolute
essential
piece
of
information
that
the
perkins
family
needed
in
order
to
get
their
property
back.
that
is
the
first
requirement
that
they
needed
in
order
to
access
what
is
an
otherwise
state
remedy.
mr.
patrick
s.
smith
i
believe--
mr.
patrick
s.
smith
--i
don't
believe
that
the
court
was
making
a
finding
there,
your
honor.
i
believe
what
the
court
was
doing
at
that
point
was
indicating
that
the
statutes
in
question,
1536,
1540,
did
not
indicate
that
a
search
warrant
number
was
needed
in
this
case.
however,
the
record
is
clear
that
mr.
perkins
went
to
the
courthouse
in
an
attempt
to
get
the
property
back.
he
was
told
that
he
needed
some
identifying
information
in
order
to
get
the
property
back.
he
went
back
to
the
detective
to
get
that
information.
they
gave
him
maybe
misinformation,
but
he
couldn't
get
that
essential
information.
mr.
patrick
s.
smith
your
honor,
justice
o'connor,
i
respectfully
submit
to
the
court
that
the
record
does
not
reveal
that,
and
the
record
reveals
that
mr.
perkins
went
to
the
courthouse
to
get
the
property,
that
he
couldn't
get
the
property
back,
that
the
clerk
would
not--
mr.
patrick
s.
smith
--i
don't
believe,
your
honor,
that
that
was
a
finding.
i
believe
that...
i
believe
that
what
we
have
here
is
a
circumstance
where
the
district
court
has
indicated
that
it
doesn't
appear
that
he
needed
the
search
warrant
number.
however,
i
don't
believe
that
that
is
a
finding
that
is
set
in...
in
such
a
way
that
it
is
binding
on
this
court,
number
one,
because
i
don't
believe
it's
a
finding.
i
think
it's
a
reference.
mr.
patrick
s.
smith
because
the
record,
your
honor,
that
is
before
this
court
clearly
indicates
that
what
we
have
in
this
case
is...
is
a
family
that
went
down,
was...
was
thwarted
on
two
occasions--
mr.
patrick
s.
smith
--mr.
and
mrs.
perkins
went
on
one
occasion,
and
mr.
perkins
and
his
daughter
on
another
occasion.
that's
correct.
mr.
patrick
s.
smith
well--
mr.
patrick
s.
smith
--in
order
to--
mr.
patrick
s.
smith
--yes.
in
order
to
answer
that
question,
justice
kennedy,
i
think
what
we
need
to
look
at
here
is
the
notice
that
was
provided.
the
note
that
was
left
at
the
residence
merely
gave
the
identity
of
the
officers
who
served
the
warrant,
who
got...
procured
the
warrant,
and
the
court
who
signed
it.
then
the
policy
of
the
city
of
west
covina
at
that
point
was
to
leave
it
up
to
the
discretion
of
the
police
officer
to
decide
what
information
to
give
to
mr.
perkins.
mr.
patrick
s.
smith
well--
mr.
patrick
s.
smith
--well,
that's
correct,
but
in
this
case
what
we
have
is
everybody
admits
that
it
was
the
perkinses'
property,
that
it
should
be
returned
to
them.
and
consequently,
the
issue
is
not
whether
the
perkinses
would
get
their
property
back
but
whether
they
can
access
the
otherwise
adequate
state
remedy.
mr.
patrick
s.
smith
no,
i
wouldn't
be
here.
mr.
patrick
s.
smith
justice--
mr.
patrick
s.
smith
--right.
but
there's
two
answers
to
that
question,
justice
scalia,
because
mr.
sutton
indicated
that
this
was
a
case
where
they
got
wrong
information.
i
don't
agree
with
that.
if
in
fact
the
police
officers
had
a
policy
or
the...
west
covina
had
a
policy
of
providing
the
search
warrant
number,
which
they
clearly
didn't...
it
was
to
leave
it
to
the
discretion--
mr.
patrick
s.
smith
--then--
mr.
patrick
s.
smith
--that
would
be
okay
because
there
was
a
procedure
in
place.
mr.
patrick
s.
smith
well--
mr.
patrick
s.
smith
--what
makes
the
constitutional
difference,
justice
scalia,
is
that
the
city
of
west
covina
did...
had
a
policy
of
leaving
it
up
to
the
discretion
of
the
police
officer.
the
police
officer
doesn't
remember.
at
one
point
he
says,
i
may
have
gave...
given
the
number;
at
another
point,
he
didn't.
mr.
patrick
s.
smith
no.
mr.
patrick
s.
smith
your
honor,
what
the
record
reveals
i
think
is
that
the
policy
of
the
city
of
west
covina
was,
one,
to
leave
it
to
the
discretion
of
the
police
officers
to
give
them
what
information
they
think
the
person
needed.
the
second
thing
was,
was
that
it's
clear
from
the
record
that
detective
who
gave
him
that
information
at
one
point
indicated
i
didn't
give
them
the
search
warrant
number.
at
another
point
he
indicates
i
may
have
given
it.
so,
it's
clear
that
the
policy
is
to
leave
it
to
the
discretion
of
the
police
officer
and
that--
mr.
patrick
s.
smith
--well--
mr.
patrick
s.
smith
--what
the
ninth
circuit...
i
will
submit
that
that
is
certainly
something
that
this
court
could
hold
obviously,
but
what
i
will
tell
you,
justice
ginburg...
ginsburg,
is
that
what
the
ninth
circuit
did
was
they
found
a
situation
where
the
due
process
rights
of
the
perkinses
was...
were
violated
because
they
weren't
given
the
information
under
mullane
which
was
reasonably
calculated
to
allow
them
for
an
opportunity
for
a
hearing.
now,
what
the
ninth
circuit
then
did
is
decide
what
standard
should
we
apply
to
decide
what
notice
is
appropriate,
the
questions
that
were
asked
before.
and
the
question
then
is
what
standard.
the
ninth
circuit
chose
the
mathews
v.
eldridge
standard,
and
why
did
they?
i
think--
mr.
patrick
s.
smith
--no,
you
don't
see
them
in
rule
41(d),
your
honor,
but
what
you
do
see
is
you
see
that
rule
41(d)
requires
that
search
warrant
be
left
at
the
location.
and
if
the
court
would
look
at
joint
appendix
92
through
99,
it's
a
copy
of
the
search
warrant,
and
the
search
warrant
says
at
the
bottom,
it
gives
the
information.
it
is
now
in
the
custody
of
the
court.
you
need
to
seek
the
court
who
has
the
property.
the
most
difficult
thing
about
this
case...
and
i
believe
that
in
this
case
is
that
maybe
the
ninth
circuit,
in
requiring
that
information,
maybe
went
too
far,
but
what
the
court
was
doing
was
using
the
mathews
balancing
test
to
determine
what
notice
should
be
given.
and
i
think
that
even
if
the
court
believes
that
the
ninth
circuit
went
too
far
in
giving
all
of
this
information,
still
the
affirmance
of
the
judgment
in
this
case
is
appropriate
because
under
mullane,
which
everybody
admits
would
be
the
standard,
it
was...
the
information
lacked
the
search
warrant
number.
mr.
patrick
s.
smith
the
problem,
mr.--
mr.
patrick
s.
smith
--i
agree
it's
a...
it's
a--
mr.
patrick
s.
smith
--predeprivation
case,
absolutely.
mr.
patrick
s.
smith
because
we
don't
have,
or
at
least
this
court
has
not
expounded,
a
principle
that
would
be
directly
applicable
to
this
case
i
believe,
and
i
believe
that
under
mullane,
it
talks
about
notice.
memphis
light
talked
about
notice,
and
if
you
can
extrapolate
the
discussion
by
this
court
on
notice,
it
provides
a
standard
of
what
is
reasonably
calculated
to
give
adequate
information
to
the
person
to
access
their
otherwise
adequate--
mr.
patrick
s.
smith
--no,
there
is,
your
honor.
the
difference...
however,
with
regard
to
notice,
when
you're
dealing
with
a
circumstance
of
what
is
the
quintessential
governmental
intrusion
into
an
unoccupied
residence
and
seizing
of
property,
i
believe
that
this
case
where
the
government
seizes
it,
clearly
minimally
they
have
to
give
notice
that
the
property
was
seized
or
that...
that
the
police
were
in
the
house.
i
don't
think
anybody
disagrees
with
that.
mr.
patrick
s.
smith
no.
you
have--
mr.
patrick
s.
smith
--you
have
your
driver's...
you
have
the
license
plate
number
of
your
car,
your
honor.
mr.
patrick
s.
smith
mr.
perkins
did
not
have
the
license
plate
to
his
search
warrant.
he
didn't
have
a
search
warrant
number.
mr.
patrick
s.
smith
no,
it's
not--
mr.
patrick
s.
smith
--it
is,
your
honor,
that
there
is
testimony
by
detective
ferrari
who
indicates
that
there's
a
record
or
a
registry
at
the
court.
however,
what
detective...
what
that
evidence
fails
to
mention,
which
is
clear
at
joint
appendix
76
and
77,
is
the
declaration
submitted
by
the
plaintiffs
that
if...
if
the
search
warrant
was
sealed,
you
couldn't
get
the
information
out
of
the
registry.
so,
clearly
there
is
perhaps
a
registry
there.
we
don't
dispute
that
there
may
be.
however,
when
it's
sealed,
the
evidence
is
overwhelming
and
clear
i
believe
that
you
can't
get
the
search
warrant
number
even
with
your
address,
and
that
is
the
difficulty
in
this
case.
mr.
patrick
s.
smith
what...
what
i
think
the
court
is
saying
there,
justice
kennedy,
is
that
there...
there...
that
the
perkins
perhaps
could
have
filed
a
motion
with
the
court.
however,
the
evidence
is
clear
i
think
from
the
record
that
the
perkins
family
did
not
have
the
adequate
information.
now,
what
the
perkinses
could
have
done
with
regard
to
filing
a
motion--
mr.
patrick
s.
smith
--and
they
went
to
the
courthouse
on
two
occasions
and
the
clerk
would
not
allow
them
into
the
courthouse.
now,
perhaps
mr.
perkins
could
have
just
filed
the
written
motion
with
the
court.
but
the
question
then
really
becomes
is
what
does
due
process
or
what
does
the
notice
require.
should
mr.
perkins
have
gone
ahead
and
filed
a
writ
of
mandate
in
the
court?
i
don't
think
so.
the
statute...
the
legislative
enactments
by
california
specifically
set
a
procedure
for
doing
exactly
what
mr.
perkins
did.
mr.
patrick
s.
smith
well,
i
don't
think
the
driver
has--
mr.
patrick
s.
smith
--i
don't
think
the
driver
even
has
to
tell
him
to
sue
me
in
that
circumstance.
mr.
patrick
s.
smith
that
case
is
different
for
a
couple
reasons.
mr.
patrick
s.
smith
i
don't...
no.
mr.
patrick
s.
smith
the
city
does
not.
but
there's
two
distinctions,
justice
scalia.
the
first
one
is,
is
that
mr.
perkins
can
identify
the
problem
that
he
is
facing
when
he's
hit
by
another
car.
he
can
get
the
license
plate
number,
the
description
of
the
person
or
the
car.
he
can't
get
the...
the
number
of
the
warrant.
he
can't
get
a
description
sufficient
to
allow
the
clerk
or
even
judge
oki
or
any
judge
on
a
writ
of
mandate
to
identify
the
property
as
being
seized
under
which
warrant
so
it
can
make
a
determination
as
to
whether
or
not
it
was
appropriately
seized
or
not.
mr.
patrick
s.
smith
well--
mr.
patrick
s.
smith
--except
that
mr.
perkins
could
not
get
into
court.
he
didn't
have
the
search
warrant
number.
mr.
patrick
s.
smith
well--
mr.
patrick
s.
smith
--well--
mr.
patrick
s.
smith
--well,
he
could,
your
honor,
get
in--
mr.
patrick
s.
smith
--no.
he
couldn't
get
into
court
under
the
procedures
enacted
by
the
california
legislature,
1536,
1540,
a
specific
procedure
designed
for
a
person
to
get
their
property
back.
he
goes
to
court.
we
need
the
number.
the
record
is
clear.
he
goes
back
to
the
detective.
the
detective
tells
him
he's
not
sure
if
he
told
him
a
number
or
not.
perkins
goes
back.
he
still
can't
get
into
court.
mr.
patrick
s.
smith
well,
what
happens,
though,
is...
is
the
issue
in
this
case
really
comes
down
to
whether
or
not
the
policy
of
the
city
of
west
covina...
i
think
that,
if
i
can
backtrack
for
a
moment,
why...
if
the
question
is
asked,
why
should
the
city
of
west
covina
provide
this
information?
now,
the
question
really
is,
is
if
you
answer
that
they
should,
the
city
of
west
covina
doesn't
want
to
admit
it.
the
question
is
whether
due
process
requires
it.
and
if
you
had
analyzed
this
case
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
or
the
fourth
amendment,
they're
both
reasonableness
standards,
and
so
if
the
city
of
west
covina
could
provide
that
and
they
already
leave
a
notice
at
the
location
and
you
do
a
balancing
test
that
is
it
a
burden
on
the
city
of
west
covina
to
do
that?
no,
it's
not.
and
in
fact,
the
los
angeles
county
sheriff's
department
in
the
motion
for
judicial
notice
of
their
document
shows
this
court
that
it
in
it
shows...
it
has
a
receipt
for
seized
property
and
a
notice
for
retrieving
property.
it
shows
a
line
for
the
search
warrant
number,
for
a
urn
file
number
by
the
police
department.
then
what
has
been
characterized
as
legal
advice
is...
essentially
comes
to
about
20
words,
that
they
can--
mr.
patrick
s.
smith
--no.
mr.
patrick
s.
smith
my
principle
is
in
the
context
of
a
search
warrant,
a
seizure
from
someone's
home,
that
when...
there
has
to
be
basic
notice,
and
the
basic
notice
has
to
be
reasonably
calculated
to
give
the
information
to
the
perkinses
sufficient...
or
anyone...
to
get
a
reasonable
access
to
an
otherwise
adequate
state
remedy.
that
would
include
not
only
the
search
warrant
number,
but
who
they...
they
proceed
before
because
the
police--
mr.
patrick
s.
smith
--it
could
be,
but
the
california
legislature
has
not
done
that.
they've
enacted
a
specific
procedure
under
1536.
mr.
patrick
s.
smith
no.
it...
certainly
it's
under
a
writ
of
mandate,
and
i
don't
dispute
that
a
writ
of
mandate
is
another
procedure
which
potentially
could
have
been
employed.
the
question
is,
however,
if
the
state
provides
a
number
of
remedies
and
there's
a
more
specific
remedy,
a
remedy
for
1536
specifically
to
get
your
property
back,
and
that's
the
avenue
that
the
perkins
took,
that's
the
universe
of
this
case.
mr.
patrick
s.
smith
if...
if
the
city
has
a
policy
of
leaving
it
to
the
discretion
of
the
officers
to
give
what
information
is
necessary
to
access
that
adequate
state
remedy,
then
yes.
the
essential
thing
is,
justice
scalia,
is
this,
is
that
what
amici
and...
and
the
petitioner
are
arguing
in
this
case
is
that
there's
this
beautiful
car
that
you
have,
this
beautiful
vehicle
with
which
they
could
have
gotten
their
property
back,
and
there
it
is
sitting
in
the
driveway.
the
problem
is,
is
they
didn't
give
them
the
keys
to
engage
the
vehicle.
mr.
patrick
s.
smith
that's
correct,
except
he
couldn't
provide
the
address
to
the
clerk
because
the
warrant
was
sealed
and
he
couldn't
get
that
information.
mr.
patrick
s.
smith
he
does.
mr.
patrick
s.
smith
no.
my
position,
your
honor,
is
that
even
if
he
had
provided
the
address,
which
i
believe
he
did...
he
provided
the
notice
of
search
warrant
that
was
left
by
the
city
of
west
covina,
that
the
clerk's
office
would
not
allow
him
because...
to
get
the
search
warrant
number,
the
key
to
the
vehicle,
because
the
search
warrant
was
sealed.
mr.
patrick
s.
smith
except--
mr.
patrick
s.
smith
--and--
mr.
patrick
s.
smith
--except,
justice
kennedy,
this,
that
what
is
it
that
a
person
has
to
do?
and
i'll
admit
that's
what
the
district
court
found,
but
the
question
is,
he
goes
to
the
court.
what
is
a
citizen
to
do?
you
can't
go
into
the
courtroom
and
stand
up,
your
honor,
i
want
my
property
back.
you
have
to
go
through
a
procedure.
he
goes
to
the
clerk's
office.
in
order
to
get
on
calendar,
in
order
to
be
heard
in
that
court,
in
order
to
engage
this
vehicle,
he
needs
to
have
this
number
to
get
the
search
warrant,
and
that's
my
position.
mr.
patrick
s.
smith
well,
i
probably
could
not
have
gotten
the
property
back.
mr.
patrick
s.
smith
because
the
search
warrant
was
sealed
and
you
couldn't
get
the
number.
now,
maybe
we
could
have
filed
a
writ
of
mandate
with
the
court,
but
unfortunately,
there's
been
no...
i
would
believe
that
there
has
been
no
indication
that
the
court
would
deny
him
the
return
of
the
property.
mr.
patrick
s.
smith
i
think
the
information
that
was
relayed...
obviously,
a
lawyer
would
perhaps
use
a
little
more
ingenuity.
maybe
he
would
know
somebody
at
the
court.
maybe
he
could
just
file
a
lawsuit
at
the
court
or
something
to
that
effect.
but
that's
not...
that
doesn't...
the
question
is
appropriate,
but
i
don't
think
it
helps
in
this
case
because
of
the
fact
that
there
was
a
procedure
by
california.
and
when
he
goes
into
court
to
implement
this
procedure,
he's
elected
a
procedure
that
the
state
of
california
has
provided,
but
the
city
of
west
covina's
policy
was
inadequate
to
give
him
that
information
and
he
couldn't
get
into
court.
mr.
patrick
s.
smith
because
i
don't
believe
i
necessarily
would
have
gotten
the
number.
mr.
patrick
s.
smith
well,
the
information
is
in
the
record,
is
that
the
document
was
sealed,
and
the
clerk's
office,
the
declaration
of
the
joint
appendix,
76
77,
is
that
you
couldn't
get
the
warrant
number
because
the
document
was
sealed.
now--
mr.
patrick
s.
smith
--yes.
mr.
patrick
s.
smith
the
question
is,
your
honor,
is
does
it
require
essentially...
and
i
don't
mean
to
be
facetious...
some
herculean
effort
by
a
citizen
to
get
the
property
back.
does
the
citizen
have
to
invoke
the
services
of
a
lawyer
who
could
be
creative
in
terms
of
getting
that
property
back?
does
the
due
process
clause
require
that?
i
don't
believe
the
due
process
clause
requires
that.
in
fact,
i
believe
that
what
the
due
process
clause
requires
or
the
fourth
amendment
is
information
which
would
reasonably
calculated
to
give
the
person--
mr.
patrick
s.
smith
--no,
i
don't
believe
that
that
necessarily...
this
court
does
not
have
to
find
that
as
fundamentally
unfair.
what
is
fundamentally
unfair
is
not
giving
him
the
information
that
is
needed
in
order
to
access
this
remedy.
now,
the
ninth
circuit
did
find
it's
fundamentally
unfair--
mr.
patrick
s.
smith
--i
believe
what
is
fundamentally
unfair
about
it...
yes,
your
honor...
is
that
it
is
fundamentally
unfair
not
to
allow...
not
to
give
the
perkinses
the
necessary
information.
what
we
have
here
is
a
policy
by
the
city
of
west
covina
to
leave
it
to
the
discretion
of
the
officer,
and
that
is
what's
unfair.
what
needs
to
be...
what
has
to
happen
here
is
that
the
court
i
think
needs
to
indicate
that
the
city...
that
due
process
requires
a
policy
where
information
is
imparted
to
a
person
to
allow
him
to
access
the
remedy.
mr.
patrick
s.
smith
that's
correct,
and
the
police
was...
the
police
were
right.
he
did
have
to
go
to
court
because
if
you
got
this
note
left
at
your
residence,
you
would
think
you
would
have
to
go
to
the
police
department.
so,
i
think
it
would
be
incumbent
upon
the
city
to
tell
them
what
court
you
have
to
go
to.
they
did
that,
and
i
think
that
that's
required.
the
question
is
did
they
give
them
the
information
that
was
necessary
to
access
the
remedy.
and
i
understand
what
justice
kennedy
is
asking,
but
i
don't
believe
that
it
is
fundamental
for
the
due
process
clause
to
require
the
person,
in
order
to
not
waive
his
rights,
to
get
in
and...
and
talk
actually
to
the
judge
in
the
courtroom.
mr.
patrick
s.
smith
that
would
be
fine,
your
honor.
mr.
patrick
s.
smith
because
of
the
fact--
mr.
patrick
s.
smith
--no.
well,
that's
a
disputed...
that's
an
issue
that
isn't...
he
says
that...
that
same
detective
who
says
he
may
have
given
them
a
number
isn't
sure
he
gave
them
the
number.
he
indicated
at
one
point
i
did
not
give
them
a
number.
at
another
point
he
says
i
may
have.
mr.
patrick
s.
smith
he
said
he
got
a...
i
think
the
word
he
used
was
a
case
number.
he
got
some
sort
of
a
number
from
ferrari,
but
went
there
and
they
said
that
was
no
number
at
all.
what
the
problem
is,
is
that
it's
an
arbitrary...
it's
a
policy
that
leaves
it
to
the
discretion
of
the
police
officer.
if
there's
a
policy
by
the
city
of
west
covina
to
leave...
not
to
leave
it,
but
they
have
to
give
them
that
information,
then
i
wouldn't
be
here
because
there
would
be
a
policy
which
implicates
or
somehow
allows
the
person
to
go
and
access
the
otherwise
adequate
state
remedy.
that's
not
what
happened
here.
what
happened
is
they
left
it
to
the
discretion
of
the
police
officer.
but
i
think
even
under
a
fourth
amendment
standard
or
a
fourteenth
amendment
standard
here,
the
policy
of
the
city
of
west
covina
is
deficient,
and
it's
deficient
because,
number
one,
if
the
court
looks
at
mullane...
and
i
think
the
court
is
looking
for
a
standard
on
how
to
decide
this
case.
we
can't
just
stand
here
and
say,
well,
if
he
had
gotten
the
number,
if
he
hadn't
gotten
the
number,
that's
sufficient.
the
court
has
given
us
a...
a
formula
by
which
to
look
at
this
case
and
judge
what
notice
is
required.
that's
i
believe
under...
under
a
mullane
type
of
standard,
reasonableness.
and
i
think
that
the
mathews
v.
eldridge
balancing
is
appropriate.
if
you
look
at
that--
mr.
patrick
s.
smith
--i...
i
agree
that
that's
a
concrete
standard,
that
i
believe
that
probably
when
the...
the
enactors
of
federal
rule
of
criminal
procedure
41
probably
went
through
what
notice
is
required
in
order
to
adequately
inform
the
person
or
give
them
the
information
to
access
the
remedy.
41--
mr.
patrick
s.
smith
--exactly.
that's
our
position,
that
the
city
of
west
covina
should
come
into
line
with
what
the
federal
government
does
and
what
the
rest
of
the
country...
most
of
the
country
does,
is
leave
a
copy
of
the
warrant
at
the
location.
if
he
had
the
copy
of
the
warrant,
we
wouldn't
be
here
today
because
it
does
have
the
search
warrant
number
on
it,
and
it
has
who
to
contact,
who
signed--
mr.
patrick
s.
smith
--well,
in
this
case--
mr.
patrick
s.
smith
--in
this...
that
may
be
the
case,
but
i'm
not
asserting
in
this
case,
justice
kennedy,
that
mr.
perkins
had
to
get
his
property
back.
he
only
needed
to
get
into
court
in
order
to
address
the
issue.
in
this
case
it's
undisputed
that
it
wasn't
evidence
of
the
crime
and
they
were
going
to
give
it
back
to
him,
and
i
think
that's
what's
critical.
but
i
think
that
this
court
has
indicated,
albeit
it
in...
in...
in...
by
justice
of
the
court,
by
justice
o'connor,
and
i
believe
also
by
justice
souter,
that
the
mathews
analysis
is
an
analysis
that
can
be
used
in
this
case.
the
burden
on
the
city--
