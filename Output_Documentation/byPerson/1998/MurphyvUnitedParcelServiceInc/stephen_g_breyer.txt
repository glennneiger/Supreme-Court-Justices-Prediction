i
don't
see
how
that
works.
i
mean,
is...
imagine
a
person
who
has
justice
scalia's
vision
without
the
glasses,
but
that
person
for
some
reason
can't
wear
glasses.
i
mean,
do
we
really
want
to
say
that
that
person
is
not
disabled?
imagine
a
person
who
can't
wear
false
teeth
for
some
reason,
and
has
none.
is
that
person
not
disabled?
i
would
think
so,
but
do
you
want
to
say
everyone
with
false
teeth
is
disabled?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
mean,
i
don't
see
how
to
get
the
statute
to
work,
and
therefore
i
want
to
know
your
answer
to
this
question
that
you
started
with.
if
you
were
to
say
you're
right,
your
client
in
fact
is
disabled,
is
it
then
necessary
to
say
everyone
who
wears
false
teeth
or
eye
glasses
is
also
disabled,
or
can
you
find
a
line
that
separates
out
those
two
instances?
you
started
down
that
track.
you
used
the
word,
permanent.
i've
seen
the
word,
easy,
i've
seen
the
word,
easily
correctable,
i've
seen
a
lot
of
words
floating
around.
i
want
to
know,
in
your
opinion,
is
there
a
way
of
drawing
the
line.
what
is
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
if
you
look
through
there,
would
you
discover,
for
example,
that
people
who
have,
let's
say
prosthetic
limbs,
or
the
people
who
have
high
blood
pressure
of
an
unusual
nature...
i
mean,
really
quite
high...
that
they
were
counted
or
not
counted?
i
mean,
could
that
be
used
as
a
basis--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--for
going
through
and
deciding
where
and
under
what
circumstances
a
corrective
device
would
or
would
not
be
counted
in
deciding
whether
a
person
was
disabled?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why
not?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
if
it
can't,
does
it
nonetheless
take
an
approach,
so
that
an
agency,
seeing
a
silence
in
the
statute
as
to
the
counting
of
corrective
devices,
or
mitigating
devices,
that
an
agency,
with
that
as
a
guide,
could
create
lists
as
to
when
you
do
count
a
corrective
device,
when
you
don't
count
one,
always
with
the
notion
of
combatting
prejudice
as
the
guiding
goal?
is
that
possible?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it
doesn't
say
anything
about
corrective
device.
i
thought
in
respect
to
whether
you
looked
at
substantial...
you
know,
substantial
impairment
with
corrective
device,
or
without,
was
a
matter
on
which
the
statute
itself
was
silent,
though
the
history
may
make
a
suggestion.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
what
does
it
say?
is,
because
of
is
versus
would?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
if
i
accept
that
you're
right.
if
i
don't
accept
that,
i'm
still
interested
in
your
reaction
to
the
idea
that
it's
up
to
the
agency
case
by
case,
or
kind
by
kind,
et
cetera.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
what
i
want,
exactly
the
question
i--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--put
it,
because
the--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--the
way
i...
what
i
wanted
you
to
focus
on,
just
that
question,
is
that
isn't
it
very
frequently
you
find
a
statute
which
is
silent
on
the
subject,
and
rather
than
reading
it
either-or,
it
becomes
up
to
the
agency
to
say
where,
looking
at
the
purpose
of
the
statute,
you
would
do
it
this
way,
and
where
you'd
do
it
the
other
way.
indeed,
i
gather
in
most
cases
in
the
government
they
do
look
at
the
person's
condition
without
corrective
devices,
but
in
the
case
of
glasses,
the
social
security
administration
looks
at
them
with
corrective
devices,
so
why
do
we
have
to
say
either-or?
why
couldn't
it
be
up
to
the
agency
to
say
where
and
when
and
under
what
circumstances?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'm
not
giving
up
yet.
that
is
to
say,
is...
there's
a
lot
of
unfounded
prejudice,
perhaps,
against
people
with
artificial
limbs,
or
perhaps
hearing
aids,
even,
or
where
you
take
medicine,
i.e.,
i
don't
mean
prejudice.
i
mean,
people
just
don't
understand
it,
and
that's
not
true
of
glasses,
and
therefore
you
focus
the
statute
on
those
people
who
congress
was
worried
about,
those
kind...
and
you
leave
out
of
the
statute
those
kinds
of
ordinary
sorts
of
things
that
really
are
not
part
of
the
problem.
that
would
be
the
rough
outline
of
an
approach
that
tries
to
leave
some
of
this
up
to
the
agency.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
if
we're
looking
at
what
they
actually
thought
about
that,
those
reports
do
talk
about
hearing
aids,
and
they
talk
about
artificial
limbs,
as
if
they
meant
it
to
come
under
1,
don't
they?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
they
don't.
