justice

but
mr.
mcallister,
that
appears
in
the
same
paragraph
that
uses
the
classic
suspect
category
language,
discrete
and
insular
minority,
politically
powerless.
i
think
that
there
must
be
many
hypertense
people
among
the
politically
powerful.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
if
we
take
the--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
if
we
take
the
rather
vague
definition
of
disability,
and
if
we're
trying
to
find
out
what
congress
meant
by
impairment,
well,
all
these
things
are
impairments,
but
substantially
limit
one
or
more
activity,
then
why
isn't
it
proper
to
go
back
to
the
findings
and
purpose
and
say,
well,
there's
a
number
here,
and
that
number
would
be
just
multiplied
if
we
took
your
view
of
what
is
a
disability,
and
the
group...
one
thinks
of
the
children
that
were
once
herded
off
into
a
room
for
special
education
as
belonging
in
that
discrete
and
insular
minority
category,
but
not
someone
who
may
have
poor
vision
but
be
the
brightest
student
in
the
class.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
maybe
we
could
deal
with
hypertense,
because
that's--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--mr.
mcallister,
may
i
just
ask
you
why
you...
you
made
a
concession.
maybe
you
didn't.
i
thought
your
position
was
that
this
man,
even
with
the
medication,
can't
get
himself
down
to
normal
because
then
he'd
have
all
these
horrible
side
effects.
the
court
of
appeals
seemed
to
have
that
drop
from
view,
and
your
argument
this
morning
seems
to
say
you're
ready
to
let
it
drop
from
view.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
wouldn't
you
want
at
least
that
issue
to
be
open
on
remand?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well
now,
what--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
feldman,
i
thought
that
mr.
murphy's
work
activity
was
a
mechanic,
and
nothing
involved
in
this
case
touches
mechanic.
it's
only
driving,
as
i
understand,
so
his
major
life
activity,
his
major
work
activity
was
fixing
cars?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes,
and...
which
he
could
do
at
a
location,
so
i
don't
understand
why
this
case
as
opposed
to
some
others
maybe
the
one
tomorrow
where
they
couldn't
be
pilots,
but
this,
his
major
work,
he
can
do.
he
just
can't
drive--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
if...
mr.
kilberg,
if
what
we're
thinking
about
is
the
correction,
and...
it
was
brought
up,
well,
what
about
a
permanent
correction
through
surgery
as
opposed
to
a
pill
every
day.
justice
o'connor
focused
on
the
regarded-as.
isn't
the
argument
for
the
petitioner
here
that
whether
i'm
disabled
or
not,
my
employer,
or
would-be
employer,
would
not
accept
the
correction,
that
the
correction
was
unacceptable
so
is
treating
me
in
my
uncorrected
state,
so
maybe
corrected
state
says
i'm
not
disabled,
but
the
employer
is
treating
me
in
my
uncorrected
state,
therefore
is
rejecting
the
correction,
therefore
is
regarding
me
as
disabled?
that's
what
i
thought
was
the
argument
that
the
petitioner
was
attempting
to
advance.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that
you
could
get
a
waiver
from
the
dot,
and
that's
hotly
contested,
and
the...
i
think
the
other
side,
in
all
fairness,
is
taking
the
position
that
the...
this
person
was
qualified,
indeed
got
a
certificate
from
the
dot
saying
he
could
drive.
there's
one
issue
that
seems
to
be
blended,
blurred,
and
frankly
i'm
confused.
it's
come
up
in
a
lot
of
the
questions.
once
you're
in
the
category
as
regarded
as,
then
there's
still
the
further
question,
are
you
qualified
to
do
the
job?
what
is
the
difference
between
those
two
standards?
one
is,
does
the
employer
regard
you
as
disabled?
if
the
answer
to
that
question
is
yes,
we
go
to
the
next
step.
the
next
step
is,
are
you
qualified
for
the
job?
now,
how
are
those
two
different?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
kilberg,
do
i
understand
your
argument
correctly
to
say
that
people
who
have
diseases
with
dread
names
but
are
very
well
controlled
by
a
pill
a
day,
like
an
epileptic,
like
a
diabetic,
that
they
would
be
the
same,
they
would
not
be
disabled
for
purposes
of
this
statute?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
that
hypertension
could
be
in
that
category.
