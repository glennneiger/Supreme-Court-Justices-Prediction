chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
number
97-1992,
vaughn
murphy
v.
united
parcel
service.
mr.
mcallister.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
say
that
your
first
point
is
that
he's
covered
by
the
ada
because
his
hypertension
limited
major
life
activity.
are
you
talking
about
his
hypertension
as
medically
corrected,
or
in
its
original
state?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
now,
explain
that,
because
i...
it's
not
immediately
apparent
to
me.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
a
lot
more
than
43--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--if
you...
if
you're
not
challenging
it
here,
and
the
court
of
appeals
took
a
particular
position
on
it,
i
don't
see
how
it
could
be
open
on
remand.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes,
that's
pretty
much
your
position,
yes.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
mcallister.
mr.
feldman,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what's
your
answer
to
the
43
million
finding
of
congress?
you
know,
it's
a
rather
specific
number,
43
million.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
that
isn't
a
complete
answer.
if
someone
had
said
100
million,
you
know,
there's
a
lot
of
room
for
hyperbole,
but
43
million,
that
suggests
that
you've
got
some
figure
in
mind
that
must
have
been
derived
from
somewhere.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
don't
see
43
million
people
can't
be
wrong.
you
say
100
million
people
can't--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--the
test
isn't
substantially
limited
in
employment,
is
it?
i
thought
substantially
limited
in
a
major
life
activity.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
does
unemployment...
an
unemployed
person
have
no
major
life
activity?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
feldman.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
kilberg,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes,
i
think,
mr.
kilberg,
that
the
petitioner
has
said
that
is
the
way
the
case
should
be
accepted
here,
so
i
don't
think
that
point
is
in
contention.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
if
actually
dot
didn't
require
what
ups
thought
it
required?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you
very
much,
mr.
kilberg.
mr.
mcallister,
you
have
2
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
mcallister.
the
case
is
submitted.
