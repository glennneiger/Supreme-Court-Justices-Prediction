mr.
stephen
r.
mcallister
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
vaughn
murphy's
extraordinary
hypertension
is
permanent
and
incurable.
it
places
a
constant
stress
on
his
cardiovascular
system
and
on
major
organs
such
as
his
heart,
his
kidneys,
and
his
eyes.
there's
no
dispute
in
this
case
that
without
medication
vaughn
murphy's
hypertension
limits
virtually
all
of
his
life
activities,
and
substantially
so.
the
fundamental
question
in
this
case
is
whether
the
americans
with
disabilities
act
applies
to
vaughn
murphy
at
all.
with
all
due
respect
to
the
lower
courts,
the
ada
applies
to
vaughn
murphy
for
two
reasons.
first,
he
has
an
actual
disability,
because
his
hypertension
substantially
limits
his
major
life
activities.
second,
ups
regarded
him
as
disabled
when
it
fired
him.
satisfying
either
of
those
two
statutory
alternatives
establishes
only
that
the
ada
applies
to
vaughn
murphy
and
that
his
suit
against
ups
should
proceed
to
the
additional
inquiries
that
the
statute
contemplates.
mr.
stephen
r.
mcallister
in
its
unmedicated
states,
chief
justice.
mr.
stephen
r.
mcallister
that's
correct,
justice
o'connor.
the
lower
courts
both
concluded
that
with
medication
he
had
no
limitations
whatsoever.
we
respectfully
disagree
with
that,
but
for
purposes
of
your
decision,
we--
mr.
stephen
r.
mcallister
--yes.
mr.
stephen
r.
mcallister
they
make
that
assumption,
yes.
mr.
stephen
r.
mcallister
yes,
it
is.
mr.
stephen
r.
mcallister
justice
scalia,
two
points
in
response
to
that.
there
may
be
certain
corrections
that,
because
they
are
permanent
and,
in
essence,
perfect,
basically
eliminate
the
underlying
impairment,
so
then
the
person
would
not
be
under
the
first
prong.
mr.
stephen
r.
mcallister
with
all
due
respect,
justice
scalia,
we
believe
there
is
a
difference
between
those
two
things.
one,
the
corrective
measurement
is
permanent,
and
although
vaughn
murphy
has
to
take
his
medicine
every
day
he
has
to
have
variations
at
times
in
how
much
he
takes,
which
medication--
mr.
stephen
r.
mcallister
--justice
scalia,
it
would...
the
question
seems
to
be
premised
on
the
notion
that
there
is
a
perfect
correction
in
a
case
like
vaughn
murphy.
in
many
of
these
cases
there's
not
a
perfect
correction.
mr.
stephen
r.
mcallister
justice
o'connor,
fundamentally,
to
serve
what
we
believe
are
the
purposes
of
the
statute,
the
critical
question
here,
first
of
all,
is
whether
this
person
is
disabled.
if
they
are
not
disabled,
because
we
look
at
the
mitigating
measures,
we
never
get
onto
any
of
the
rest
of
the
statutory
inquiry.
mr.
stephen
r.
mcallister
i
agree
with
that,
justice
o'connor.
the
regarded
as
prong
is
very
important,
and
it's
particularly
important
in
this
case.
it
is
not...
was
not
in
our
view
properly
interpreted
by
the
lower
courts,
so
that
you
could
take
the
view
that
if
you
look
at
mitigating
measures,
vaughn
murphy
can
do
lots
of
things,
but
the
fact
remains
that
ups
fired
him
solely
because
of
his
high
blood
pressure.
they
regarded
him
as
disabled,
and
yet
he
got
nowhere
in
the
lower
courts
because
the
lower
courts
said...
they
relied
on
a
dot
regulation.
somehow
that's
separate
from
his
high
blood
pressure,
and
they
didn't
really
think
that
he
couldn't
do
all
these
sorts
of
life
activities.
mr.
stephen
r.
mcallister
yes,
it
is
used
in
the
findings.
mr.
stephen
r.
mcallister
justice
scalia,
what
congress
was
talking
about
was
a
large
group,
i
think,
rather
than
whether
or
not
it's
a
discrete
and
insular
majority.
mr.
stephen
r.
mcallister
is
a
large
group.
mr.
stephen
r.
mcallister
more
than
43
million.
that
certainly
is
not
some
sort
of
a
scientific
finding.
in
our
view
it
suggested
that
they
expected
the
statute
would
apply
relatively
broadly.
there
may
be
some
other
ways--
mr.
stephen
r.
mcallister
--yes,
it
does.
mr.
stephen
r.
mcallister
on
our
theory,
it
may
still
work
out,
43
million.
that
is
another
explanation.
mr.
stephen
r.
mcallister
the
notion
would
be
certainly
widely
shared,
relatively
common
impairments.
the
eeoc
has
taken
the
position
that
the
substantially
limits
language
means,
compared
to
an
average
person,
so
if
there
are
lots
of
americans
who
share
this
impairment
on
an
average
sense,
the
average
eyesight
is
not
20/20,
it's
something
worse
than
20/20,
so
in
an
average
sense,
someone
who...
i
don't
know
what
numbers
it
would
be,
but
say
20/40
might
not
be
substantially
limited
under
the
statute.
mr.
stephen
r.
mcallister
we
don't
get
that
out
of
the
statute--
mr.
stephen
r.
mcallister
--but
the
43
million--
mr.
stephen
r.
mcallister
--that's
correct,
justice
stevens.
mr.
stephen
r.
mcallister
the--
mr.
stephen
r.
mcallister
--there
is
a
line
that
can
be
drawn,
justice
breyer,
and
the
line
would
be
between
what
would
be
considered
minor
or
trivial
impairments
and
serious
impairments.
it's
effectively
the
line
the
fifth
circuit
drew.
mr.
stephen
r.
mcallister
in
the--
mr.
stephen
r.
mcallister
--in
the
findings,
justice
scalia,
the
finding
that
ups
talks
about
in
its
brief
to
some
extent,
congress
speaks
to
people
who
have
characteristics
beyond
their
control,
and
there's
a
lot
of
legislative
history
that
makes
clear
they
were
not
concerned
about
minor,
trivial
impairments.
mr.
stephen
r.
mcallister
with
all
due
respect,
justice
ginsburg,
congress
did
not
intend...
and
this
is
replete
throughout
the
legislative
history,
i
mean,
just
the
way
the
statute
works
as
well...
did
not
intend
this
statute
to
apply
only
to
sort
of
traditional
stereotypes
about
who
is
or
is
not
disabled.
now,
there
are
lines
that
can
be
drawn
so
that
it
may
be
not
all
100
million
or
however
many
people
have
myopia
are
covered,
and
justice
souter
has
suggested
one
of
those.
it
is,
substantially
limits
can
be
made
based
on
an
average
assessment,
which
means
not
everyone
with
near-sightedness
is
necessarily
disabled.
mr.
stephen
r.
mcallister
hypertension
is
the
same
way.
hypertension
begins
medically
at
140
over
90.
vaughn
murphy
unmedicated
is
250
over
160,
the
most
severe
stage
that
the
doctors
recognize.
it
may
well
be
that
a
lot
of
the
people
around
140
over
90,
or
150
over
100,
are
not
substantially
limited,
whether
or
not
you
consider
mitigating
measures
like
medication.
vaughn
murphy--
mr.
stephen
r.
mcallister
--justice
ginsburg,
we
disagree
with
the
court
of
appeals'
conclusion.
it
did
conclude
that
on
medication
he
functions
completely
normally.
we
disagree
with
that,
but
for
purposes
of
this
issue,
we're
willing
to
accept
some--
mr.
stephen
r.
mcallister
--we
would
love
to
have
that
issue
open
on
remand.
mr.
stephen
r.
mcallister
that's
why
i
said
this
morning
we're
willing
to
accept
and
have
this
decided
on
the
grounds
that
he
is
functional--
mr.
stephen
r.
mcallister
--yes,
we
did.
yes,
we
did.
mr.
stephen
r.
mcallister
yes,
justice
o'connor,
that
would
be
precisely
our
position.
mr.
stephen
r.
mcallister
i'd
love
to
justice
scalia.
mr.
stephen
r.
mcallister
the
regarded-as
prong
is
a
very
important
part
of
the
definition
for
precisely
the
reasons
this
case
demonstrates.
if
you
take
into
account
the
mitigating
measures,
people
like
vaughn
murphy
may
not
be
covered
under
the
first
prong,
but
it's
clear
congress
intended
to
cover,
for
example,
diabetics,
epileptics,
people
who
have
mitigating
measures
one
way
or
the
other,
and
in
our
view
he
is
covered
either
under
the
first
prong
or
he's
covered
under
the
regarded-as
prong.
ups
is
arguing
on
the
regarded-as
prong
is
basically
he
failed
to
meet
a
qualification
standard
that
we
think
was
set
basically
by
the
department
of
transportation,
but
in
our
view
that's
wrong.
that
is
a
later
issue
in
the
statute.
that
should
not
have
been
imported
into
the
regarded-as
prong,
otherwise
an
employer
would
always
be
able
to
at
least
assert
that
we
didn't
fire
or
not
hire
this
person
because
of
their
impairment,
we
fired
them
because
they
failed
to
meet
a
job
qualification,
and
then
the
only
way
around
that
would
be
to
try
to
prove
that's
a
pretext,
but
in
our
view
that's
not
how
the
statute
works.
the
qualification
issues,
murphy's
ability
to
do
the
job,
whether
or
not
he
can
qualify
under
dot
regulations,
which
the
solicitor
general
asserts
that
he
may
be
able
to
as
do
we,
is
all
later.
we
never
got
to
those
later
inquiries,
so
we
never
had
a
chance
to
actually
litigate
whether
or
not
he
could
meet
the
department
of
transportation
requirements.
that's
what
we'd
like
to
get
back
to
the
lower
courts
and
do.
with
the
court's
permission,
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time.
mr.
stephen
r.
mcallister
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i'd
like
to
make
just
one
point
about
the
regarded-as
prong,
and
that
is
the
difference
and
the
importance
between
the
disability
determination
and
the
qualification
standards
question.
the
problem
for
vaughn
murphy
is
ups
raises
the
qualification
standard
as...
the
reason
they
did
not
regard
him
as
disabled,
they
simply,
in
their
view,
regarded
him
as
unqualified.
that
should
not
be
part
of
the
disability
determination.
that's
what
the
next
step
is
about,
does
he
meet
the
dot
regulation,
or
does
he
not,
but
that
is
not
a
question
of
whether
or
not
vaughn
murphy
was
regarded
as
disabled.
unless
there
are
further
questions,
thank
you.
