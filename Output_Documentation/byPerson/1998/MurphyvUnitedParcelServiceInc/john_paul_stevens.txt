justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
but
everybody
who
wears
glasses
is
not
close
to
blind.
there
are
a
lot
of
people
who
will
wear
glasses
to
get
to
20/20,
but
maybe
20/30,
20/40,
and
without
glasses
they're
not
substantially
impaired
in
their
life
activities,
even
though
they're
better
off
with
glasses.
justice
john
paul
stevens
--i'm
not
sure.
justice
john
paul
stevens
didn't
it
come
out
of
a
speech
on
the
house
floor
by
just
one
of
the
legislators?
justice
john
paul
stevens
turning
to
the
regarded
as
for
just
a
second,
supposing
a
company
like
this
one
has
a
flat
rule
on
blood
pressure,
that
over
a
certain
figure,
you're
ineligible
for
the
job.
would
that
mean,
within
your
understanding
of
regarded
as,
that
they
regard
everybody
who
doesn't
pass
that
test
as
disabled?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
that
would
mean--
justice
john
paul
stevens
that
would
mean,
then,
that
any
physical,
flat
rule
for
job
qualification
would
violate
the
statute.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
but
in
this
case,
is
the
limit
is
a
limit
on
blood
pressure
at
a
certain
pair
of
figures,
it
seems
to
me
that
if...
everybody
who
flunks
that
test
is
in
the
view
of
the
company
is
regarded
as
disabled
because
they
don't
have
the
required
physical
characteristic.
justice
john
paul
stevens
which
would
mean...
i
mean,
maybe
this
is
right.
i'm
just
trying
to
think
it
through.
it
would
mean,
it
seems
to
me,
that
every
physical
requirement,
at
least
with
regard
to
blood
pressure,
would
fall,
and
the
company
would
have
to
be
able
to
prove
that
there's
an
independent
reason
for
not
hiring
the
person.
justice
john
paul
stevens
why
not?
that's
what
i
need
help
with.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask,
before
you
leave
the
43
million,
could
you
tell
me,
identify
what
you
think
are
the
components
of
that
class
of
43
million?
how
do
they...
how--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--yes,
but
there's
no...
well,
go
ahead.
i'm
sorry.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
seems
to
me...
you
mean,
that
survey
was
prepared
by
the
census
bureau?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
is
that
census
bureau
survey
identified
somewhere
by
name
so
i
could
read
it
if
i
wanted
to?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
you
cite
on
that
page
is
something
called
bureau
of
the
census
disability
functional
limitation
of
health
insurance
coverage,
1984-1985,
p-70,
that's
what
you're
talking
about?
justice
john
paul
stevens
okay.
justice
john
paul
stevens
then
my
next
question
is,
it
says
there's
37,
3
million
people
with
a
functional
limitation.
justice
john
paul
stevens
can
you
give
me
some
examples
of
the
functional
limitation
that
made
up
that
figure,
or
it's
just
a
ball
park
figure?
justice
john
paul
stevens
for
example,
would
i
be
able
to
tell
from
that
document
whether
someone
who
had...
say,
was
legally
blind,
without
glasses,
had
2200
vision
but
who
could
wear
glasses
and
be
corrected
to
20/20,
whether
that
person
would
be
in
the
figure
or
out?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
could
tell?
justice
john
paul
stevens
even
if
that
person
was
legally
blind?
justice
john
paul
stevens
are
you
saying
that
if
they
had
a
special
rule,
a
very
strict
rule
on
blood
pressure
that
nobody
else
in
the
industry
had,
because
they
thought
that's
a
health
requirement
relating
to
safety
and
all
the
rest,
wouldn't
one
say
that
whether...
regardless
of
what
all
the
rest
of
the
industry
regarded
as
disability,
that
ups
regarded
anyone
who
did
not
meet
that
standard
as
being
disabled?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
it's
a
perception
of
every
individual
who
fails
the...
who
doesn't
meet
the
standard.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
isn't
this--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--does
it
answer
the
evidentiary
issue
itself?
i
mean,
what
would
be
your
response
to
the
evidence
which
i
think
is
in
this
record
that
they
did
have
that
standard,
he
didn't
meet
it,
ergo,
he
was
regarded
by
ups
as
being
disabled
at
least
with
respect
to
this
line
of
work?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
mean,
the
availability
of
jobs
in
other
companies
always
is
a
defense
to
your
saying,
we
won't
hire
people
with
this
characteristic?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
this
question,
just
for
your
comment?
given
the
uncertainty,
particularly
on
the
regarded
as
point,
and
the
possible
ambiguity
on
the
other,
would
you
comment
on
your
view
as
to
whether
it
would
be
appropriate
to
look
at
legislative
history
in
this
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
you
won't
comment?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
why
not,
other
than
offending
justice
scalia?
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
regarded
as
is
perfectly
clear,
too.
