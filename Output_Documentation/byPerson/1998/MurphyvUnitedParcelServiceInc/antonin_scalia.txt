mr.
mcallister--
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
mcallister,
your
client
can
be
rendered
better,
and
you
say
we
should
assume
not
disabled,
by
regularly
taking
medicine.
what
about
those
whose
disability
is
eliminated
by
some
more
permanent
physical
method,
for
example,
getting
a
replacement
hip?
you
know,
without
that
replacement
hip,
i
would
be
totally
unable
to
function,
but
i
have
the
replacement
hip,
or
i
have
a
heart
bypass.
now,
should
we...
what
should
we
regard
the
criterion
as
to
whether
the
person
is
disabled
or
not?
justice
antonin
scalia
why
should
that
make
a
difference,
then?
i
don't
see
why
it
should
make
a
difference
if
you
can
be...
let's
assume
you
can
be
rendered
perfect
by
just
taking
a
pill
every
day.
your
assertion
is
that
in
the
one
hand
taking
a
pill
every
day
does
not
cause
you
to
be
no
longer
disabled,
but
getting
a
replacement
heart
valve
or
something
like
that
does.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
what?
the
fact
is,
every
day...
my
hypothetical
is,
you
render
it
perfectly
normal.
i
mean,
we're
leaving
aside
the
question
of
whether
he's
still
disabled
after
taking
the
pill.
i
assume
he's
perfectly
normal
just
by
taking
the
pill
every
day.
i
can't
see
why
it
makes
any
sense
to
call
one
person
continuing...
to
be
continuingly
disabled
and
the
other
person
not,
just
because
the
one
remedy
is
by
some
physical
means
and
the
other
one
is
by
taking
a
pill
every
day.
in
terms
of
the
purposes
of
the
act,
why
should
it
make
any
difference?
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
the
theory
we're
arguing
the
case.
in
response
to
justice
o'connor's
question,
we're
setting
aside
the
question
of
whether
he's
not,
you
know,
continuingly
disabled.
i
mean--
justice
antonin
scalia
before
we
get
to
the
regarded
as,
though,
let's
talk
a
little
more
about,
you
know,
whether
he's
disabled
or
not,
never
mind
the
regarded
as.
what
do
you
do
with
the
very
first
words
of
the
statute,
which
says,
the
congress
finds
that
some
43
million
americans
have
one
or
more
physical
or
mental
disabilities?
now,
if,
you
know,
corrective
measures
are
not
counted,
i
am
disabled
in
a
major
life
function.
i
mean,
i
could
not
do
my
current
job,
i
could
not
do
quite
a
few
other
jobs
without
glasses,
and
if
corrective
measures
are
eliminated,
many
more
than
43
million
americans...
i
mean,
i
guess
it's
sort
of
nice
to
think
that
this
is...
you
know,
that
a
majority
of
americans
can
claim
the
benefits
of
the
disabilities
act.
that's
very
comforting.
but
congress
did
say
that...
i
think
they
used
in
this
prologue,
too,
the
famous
words,
discrete
and
insular
minority.
isn't
that
used
in
the
prologue?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
how
can
you
possibly
say
it's
a
discrete
and
insular
minority
if
people
who,
you
know,
wear
glasses
and
have
all
sorts
of
corrective
measures
for
what
would
otherwise
be
disabilities?
it
just
doesn't
square
with
what
congress
seems
to
be
talking
about
here.
justice
antonin
scalia
they
said
some
43
million
americans.
i
mean,
that's
a--
justice
antonin
scalia
--i
mean,
a
lot
of
americans
wear
glasses
and
couldn't
function
without
them.
many
more--
justice
antonin
scalia
--no,
i
thought...
discrete
and
insular
minority,
they
said.
justice
antonin
scalia
--ask
justice
souter
how
long
his
arms
are.
justice
antonin
scalia
where
do
you
get
that
out
of
the
statute?
what
words
in
the
statute--
justice
antonin
scalia
--i
mean,
a
disability
is
a
disability,
and
without
correction,
i'm,
you
know,
close
to
blind.
justice
antonin
scalia
that
doesn't
count
because
a
lot
of
other
people
are
the
same
way?
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
but
a
lot
more
than
43
million.
justice
antonin
scalia
we're
not
here
to
draw
lines.
i
mean,
i'm
looking
for
a
line
that's
in
the
statute.
i
am
sure
you
can
draft
a
statute
that
would
solve
that
problem,
but
the
issue
is,
does
this
statute
have
any
such
condition
in
it,
and
if
so,
what
language
do
you
rely
upon
that
allows
us
to
make
this
distinction.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
could
write
it
in.
i
mean,
that's
very
nice.
it's
not
the
business
i'm
in.
justice
antonin
scalia
--myopics
of
the
world
unite.
justice
antonin
scalia
it--
--it's
not
in
your
questions
presented
here.
justice
antonin
scalia
maybe
you
should
say
a
few
words
about
the
regarded--
justice
antonin
scalia
--i've
stopped
you.
i'm
sorry.
justice
antonin
scalia
do
you
know
how
the
43
million
figure
was
developed.
i
don't
use
legislative
history,
but
i
understand
that
you
do.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
i
understand
that
it
came
from
census--
justice
antonin
scalia
--from
census
reports
which
contain
the
question,
you
know,
is
your
eyesight
bad,
and
the
follow-up
question,
is
it
still
bad
with
corrective
glasses,
and
that
was
not
counted
among
the
43
million,
if
that
was
the
answer.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
would
they
not
be
included
in
respondent's
count?
i
think
they
surely
would
be.
you
mean
that
someone
who
can
only
walk
with
a
walker
is
not
impaired,
even
with
the
walker,
in
major
life
activities?
justice
antonin
scalia
he
can't
play
tennis.
justice
antonin
scalia
he
can't
play
a
lot
of
sport...
i
mean,
they
may
argue
that.
i'm
not
sure
they're
going
to
win.
justice
antonin
scalia
are
you
willing
to
concede
that
if
we
come
out...
if
we
come
out
the
way
you
don't
want
us
to
come
out,
that
someone
who
has
a
prosthetic
leg
is
not
disabled?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
wouldn't
think
so.
justice
antonin
scalia
--it
just
means
they
can't
do
this
job...
i'm
sorry.
justice
antonin
scalia
being
a
truck
driver
is
a
major
life
activity?
justice
antonin
scalia
--being
a
truck
driver
is
a
major
life
activity?
what
about
being
one
of
these
people
that
put
up
skyscrapers
and
run
along
beams,
and
the
company
has
a
rule,
you
know,
if
you
have
a
mild
agoraphobia
you
can't
do
it,
and
you're
saying
he's
excluded
from
a
major
life
activity.
he
can't...
i
don't
know.
there's
a
name
for
those
people,
whatever
they
are.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
a
class
of
jobs.
justice
antonin
scalia
you're
saying
any
class--
justice
antonin
scalia
--being
excluded
from
any
class
of
jobs
is
being
excluded
from
a
major
life
activity.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
can't
be
an
accountant.
justice
antonin
scalia
--a
lot
of
trouble,
mr.
kilberg.
i
was
really
troubled
by
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
kilberg,
i
assume
that
if
we
reject
your
is
argument,
i
mean,
even
if
one
assumes
that
your
is
versus
would
argument
is
wrong,
it
is
still
your
position
that
the
statute
requires
an
either-or.
i
mean,
either
corrective
measures
are
included,
that's
a
plausible
interpretation
of
the
statue,
or
corrective
measures
are
not
included,
which
may
be
a
plausible
interpretation
of
the
statute,
but
i
don't
see
any
way
to
interpret
it
to
say
that
corrective
measures
are
included
sometimes,
frequently
used
corrective
measures
are
included,
but
corrective
measures
are
not
included
sometimes.
justice
antonin
scalia
is
there
any
way
to
get
that
out
of
the
language?
justice
antonin
scalia
how
come
he
worked
for
the
prior
23
years
without
it?
i
mean,
what
had
changed?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
this
wasn't
ups's
regulation
anyway.
it
isn't--
justice
antonin
scalia
--it
isn't
that
ups
deemed
him
unqualified
because
of
blood
pressure.
it's
that
ups
could
not
hire
him
because
of
a
dot
regulation,
wasn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
would
ups
have
been
in
violation
of
the
law
if
it
hired
him?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
it's
hard
to
see,
then,
that
it's...
ups'
mere
compliance
with
the
law
is
any
indication
of
what
ups
deemed.
they
were
just
obeying
the
law.
is
that
conceded
by
petitioner?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
let's--
--well,
what
you've
said
about
the
standard,
i
can't
believe
that
the
standard
for
deemed
disabled
is,
you
have
to
regard
him
as
disabled
for
all
work
of
this
sort
in
the
industry.
that
would
enable
a
company
to
say,
we
have
special
standards.
i
don't
care,
the
rest...
everybody
else
in
the
industry
will
hire
asthmatics.
we
don't
like
asthmatics.
we're
not
saying...
we're
not
deeming
you
to
be
disabled,
because
we
acknowledge
you
can
get
a
job
in
a
lot
of
other
places.
that
would
be
okay.
justice
antonin
scalia
that
would
be
okay.
justice
antonin
scalia
wow.
that
seems
very
counterintuitive.
people
don't--
justice
antonin
scalia
and
good
reason.
