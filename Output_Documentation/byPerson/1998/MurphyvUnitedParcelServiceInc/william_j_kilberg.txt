mr.
william
j.
kilberg
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
before
i
go
any
further
with
my
remarks,
let
me
provide
the
court
with
some
information
that
i
believe
was
requested
in
both
mr.
mcallister
and
mr.
feldman's
argument.
at
page
13
of
our
brief
and
at
page
21
of
respondent's
brief
in
the
united
case
is
the
legislative
history,
the
background
of
the
43
million
number.
i
would
also
point
out
that
in
our
brief
the
citation
is
given
as
135
congressional
record
8901.
it
should
be
8601.
this
is...
i
apologize
to
the
court.
this
is
the
result
of
my
impairment--
mr.
william
j.
kilberg
--well--
[laughter]
i
mention
it,
justice
scalia,
only
because
i
was
pointing
out
my
own
impairment,
which
i
deny
is
a
disability.
i
would
also
note,
again
with
regard
to
the
43
million
figure,
that
there
is
a
substantial
number
of
persons
who
are,
as
a
result
of
myopia
or
other
correctable
vision
impairments,
unable
to
drive,
and
a
number
of
courts
of
appeals
have
held
that
driving
is,
in
fact,
a
major
life
activity,
so
that
number
would
exceed
43
million
in
any
event.
unlike
petitioner
and
his
amici,
who
rely
almost
exclusively
on
legislative
history
and
deference
arguments--
mr.
william
j.
kilberg
--certainly.
this
was
a...
the
43
million
figure
was
derived
from
census
data.
congressman
coelho
explained
the
43
million
in
a
speech
on
the
floor
of
the
house,
and
he
explained
that
census
data,
which
i
think
he
said
projected
some
36
million
people...
the
actual
number
happened
to
have
been
37
million,
but
he
said
some
36
million
people
are
disabled.
that
census
data
in
turn
relied--
mr.
william
j.
kilberg
--it
relied
on
a
survey
of
americans
which
actually
looked
to
functional
limitations,
and
took
into
account
mitigation
or
ameliorations.
mr.
william
j.
kilberg
that
survey
was
prepared...
yes.
that
was
a
census
bureau
survey.
mr.
william
j.
kilberg
it
is
identified
in
the
legislative
history
which
is
cited
in
our
brief
and
in
united's
brief.
i
believe
it's
the...
it
was
a
study
that
was
called
the
threshold
of
something.
i
can't
remember
the
full
name
at
the
moment.
mr.
william
j.
kilberg
that's
what
i'm
talking
about.
mr.
william
j.
kilberg
that
data,
and
then
the
way
they
got
to
the
43
million--
mr.
william
j.
kilberg
--yes.
mr.
william
j.
kilberg
it's
a...
i
suspect
it's
a
bit
of
a
ball
park
figure,
and
then
congressman
coelho
then
added
to
it
by
saying
that
the
number
has
been
growing,
and
so
he
then
estimated
it
to
be
43
million
as
of
the
time
of
the
act,
because
this
was
19...
i
believe
1980,
or
maybe
it
was
1990
census...
no,
it
must
have
been
1980
census
data,
and
he
was
estimating--
mr.
william
j.
kilberg
--yes,
you
would.
mr.
william
j.
kilberg
yes,
and
you
would
find
that
that
person
was
not
counted.
mr.
william
j.
kilberg
that's
correct,
so
long
as
the
person
had
correctable
vision
to
normal.
unlike--
mr.
william
j.
kilberg
--that
would--
mr.
william
j.
kilberg
--no,
justice
breyer,
not
with
that--
mr.
william
j.
kilberg
--not
with
that
degree
of
specificity,
but
what
you--
mr.
william
j.
kilberg
--but
the
statute
here
provides
a
definition,
and--
mr.
william
j.
kilberg
--no,
i
disagree.
i
believe
the
statute--
mr.
william
j.
kilberg
--well,
we
believe
that
this
case
begins
and
ends
with
the
language
and
structure
of
the
statute.
mr.
william
j.
kilberg
well,
the...
we
believe
here
that
prong
1
of
the
statutory
definition
defines
disability
as
an
impairment
that
substantially
limits
the
major
life
activities
of
a
particular
individual.
brought
down
to
this
case,
it
simply
cannot
be
said
that
mr.
murphy's
impairment
substantially
limited
his
major
life
activities,
because
as
a
result
of
his
medication
he
does
not
suffer
any
limitations,
and
his
personal
physician
so
testified,
and
that's...
in
terms
of
the
joint
appendix,
i
would
refer
the
court
to
63a
of
the
joint
appendix.
dr.
doubek,
who
is
physician
to
mr.
murphy,
said
in
deposition,
he
functions
normally
doing
every
day
activity
that
an
every
day
person
does.
mr.
william
j.
kilberg
i
agree
there
is--
mr.
william
j.
kilberg
--no,
there
is
no
way
to
get
that
out
of
the
language,
justice
scalia.
mr.
william
j.
kilberg
i'm
sorry,
no.
mr.
william
j.
kilberg
i
did
not
understand--
mr.
william
j.
kilberg
--because
in
this
case,
justice
breyer,
the
statute
is
clear.
i
believe
the
language
of
the
statute
is
subject
to
only
one
interpretation.
the
term
disability
means,
with
respect
to
an
individual,
a
physical
or
mental
impairment
that
substantially
limits
one
or
more
of
the
major
life
activities
of
such
individual.
mr.
william
j.
kilberg
it
is
difficult,
justice
kennedy.
i
suggest
it
is
more
than
difficult,
it's
impossible.
mr.
william
j.
kilberg
that's
correct.
mr.
william
j.
kilberg
that's
correct.
mr.
william
j.
kilberg
that
is
correct.
mr.
william
j.
kilberg
that
is
correct,
justice
o'connor,
and
indeed,
one
of
the
major
inconsistencies
in
petitioner's
argument,
or
the
eeoc's
argument,
is
that
throughout
the
eeoc's
regulations
and
their
compliance
manual
and
so
on,
they
talk
in
terms
of
actual
effect,
actual
impact,
the
results
on
an
individual,
which
is
inconsistent
with
this
notion
that
you
don't
take
mitigating
measures
into
account.
mr.
william
j.
kilberg
and
i
believe,
justice
breyer,
that
the
star...
the
congress
came
to
a
similar
conclusion
to
yours,
but
they
did
it
with
prongs
2
and
3.
they
said
that
you
cannot
discriminate
against
someone
because
they
have
a
record
of
a
substantial
limitation
on
a
major
life
activity,
nor
can
you
discriminate
against
someone
because
you
perceive
them
as
having
a
substantial
limitation
on
a
major
life
activity.
mr.
william
j.
kilberg
no.
mr.
william
j.
kilberg
i
don't
believe
so,
no.
mr.
william
j.
kilberg
in
the
record
here,
however,
there's
simply
no
evidence
that
ups
perceived
mr.
murphy
as
being
substantially
limited
in
the
major
life
activity
of
working.
mr.
william
j.
kilberg
i
don't
believe
so.
the--
mr.
william
j.
kilberg
--i
don't
believe
that
that's
the
correct
reading
of--
mr.
william
j.
kilberg
--yes,
and
i--
mr.
william
j.
kilberg
--the...
i
believe
the
case
law
under
the
rehabilitation
act
and
under
the
americans
with
disability
act
is
quite
consistent
on
the
point
that
it
is
the
subjective
view.
the
question
is,
how
did
the
employer
perceive
the--
mr.
william
j.
kilberg
--in
this
instance,
mr.
murphy
had
been
employed
for
22
years
as
a
mechanic.
he
had
worked
all
that
time
without
ever
needing
a
dot
health
card.
within
2
to
3
weeks
of
his
having
left
employment
with
ups,
he
obtained
another
job
as
a
mechanic
without
any
need
for
dot
health
card.
i
don't
think
there's
any
question
that
he's
not
substantially
limited
in
working.
the
question
then
becomes,
did
ups
have
a
different
perception.
there
was
no
evidence
put
into
the
record
with
regard
to
the
number
of
employers
like
ups
who
require
mechanics
to
have
a
dot
health
card
to
be
able
to
drive
in
interstate
commerce.
the
only
evidence
in
the
record
is
evidence
that
ups
put
in
of
its
own
expert
which
showed
the
number
of
jobs
that
mr.
murphy
is
perfectly
qualified
to
handle.
ups
perceived
mr.
murphy
as
being
unable
to
work
for
it
as
a
mechanic,
a
very
particular
job,
because
he
did
not
have
a
valid
dot
health
card,
and
therefore
could
not
engage
in
road
tests
and
road
calls.
mr.
william
j.
kilberg
it
suggests...
he
had
not
worked
for
ups.
he
had
worked
for
other
employers.
it
suggests
that
other
employers
employing
individuals
as
mechanics
did
not
require
them
to
drive
large
vehicles
in
interstate
commerce
to
test--
mr.
william
j.
kilberg
--the
issue
would
still
be
ups's
perception.
it
may
well
be
evidence
of
that
perception,
but
as
to
what
dot
did
or
did
not
require,
but
the
underlying
question
always
remains,
did
the
employer
regard
the
individual
as
being
substantially
limited
in
a
major
life
activity,
here
the
life
activity
of
work?
did
they
perceive--
mr.
william
j.
kilberg
--they
may
be
regarding
that
criteria
as
a
necessary
criteria
for
their
job.
that's
more
a
perception
of
the
job
than
it
is
a
perception
of
the
individual.
mr.
william
j.
kilberg
and
in
those
circumstances
it
would
be
evidence
that
the
plaintiff
could
put
in
to
show
what
the
employer's
perception
might
be.
mr.
william
j.
kilberg
--but
in
this
case
there
is
no
such
evidence.
mr.
william
j.
kilberg
because
again
there
is...
the
only
line
of
work
that
we
would
be
talking
about
here
if
we
got
to
that
point,
the
only
class
of
job
are
mechanic's
jobs,
which
require
someone
to
drive
in
interstate
commerce.
we
have
no
evidence
in
the
record,
there's
no
evidence
on
which
a
reasonable
jury
could
determine
that
that
is
a
substantial
limitation
on
the
life
activity
of
working.
that
merely
suggests
that
this
individual
is
not
qualified--
mr.
william
j.
kilberg
--indeed,
even
the
eeoc
in
its
regulations
looks
to
not
only
the
number
of
jobs,
but
the
number
of
jobs
in
the
geographic
area.
you
have
to
show
that
he
was
perceived
as
being
substantially
limited
in
a
number
of
jobs
in
that
geographic
area,
jobs
for
which
his
skills
and
training
would
permit
him.
here,
we
have
nothing
in
the
record
like
this.
mr.
william
j.
kilberg
no.
this
is--
mr.
william
j.
kilberg
--that's
correct.
if
ups--
mr.
william
j.
kilberg
--yes,
justice
scalia.
he
would...
they
would
have
been
in
violation
of
the
law,
and
they
would
have
been
subject
to
both
civil
and
criminal
sanctions.
mr.
william
j.
kilberg
it
is...
the
petitioner
takes
the
view
that
there
was
an
opportunity
to
depart
from
the
dot
guidelines.
mr.
william
j.
kilberg
they
really
are
separated.
there's
some
confusion
because
the
court
of
appeals
was
responding
to
an
argument
that
petitioner
had
made
below
that
ups
had
acted
based
upon
myth
and
stereotype.
the
court
of
appeals
was
seeking
to
make
the
point
that
justice
scalia
just
made,
which
is
that
the...
that
ups
was
not
acting
on
myth
and
stereotype,
they
were
acting
on
a
government
standard.
but
the
issue,
and
the
issue
i
think
is
clearly
dealt
with
in
the
district
court
decision,
the
issue
is
what
ups
perceived
mr.
murphy
to
be
substantially
limited
in,
if
anything,
and
here
all
ups
did
was
perceive
mr.
murphy
quite
accurately
as
being
unable
to
meet
the
dot
criteria.
mr.
william
j.
kilberg
well,
indeed--
mr.
william
j.
kilberg
--that
would
be
okay.
mr.
william
j.
kilberg
yes.
mr.
william
j.
kilberg
yes.
mr.
william
j.
kilberg
that's
correct.
mr.
william
j.
kilberg
yes.
mr.
william
j.
kilberg
fail
the
regarded
prong
and
win
on
the
qualification.
mr.
william
j.
kilberg
you
would
have
to
have
a
situation
where
the
employer
perceived
the
individual
as
being
substantially
limited
in
a
major
life
activity,
and
the...
presuming
that
the
individual
was
not,
but
the
individual...
hiv
might
be
a
good
case
of
that,
where
the
individual...
the
employer
assumes,
regards
the
individual
as
being
unable
to
function.
the
tuberculosis
case,
the
arline
case
that
this
court
dealt
with
some
years
ago,
might
be
an
even
better
example,
because
that
was,
as
i
recall,
a
regarded-as
case,
where
the
school
district
regarded
the
individual
as
being
unable
to
function
because
she
had
a
contagious
disease,
tuberculosis.
the
court
dealt
with
the
qualification
issue
separately
in
that
case,
as
i
recall,
by
remanding
to
the
lower
court
to
determine
whether
in
fact
there
was
a
direct
threat.
mr.
william
j.
kilberg
well,
but
certainly
employers
can
set
physical
standards.
numbers
of
employers
have
set
physical
standards
with
regard
to
lifting,
for
example,
and
the
courts
have
accepted
those
as
not
being
indicative
of
disability
and
said
those
are
perfectly
legitimate
standards.
you
may
need
25
pounds
to
lift,
to
be
able
to
lift
25
or
more
pounds,
and
have
done
that
at
the
initial
stage,
and
individuals
who
cannot
lift
more
than
25
pounds
have
not
been
regarded
as
being
disabled,
because
that's
not
viewed
as
a
substantial
limitation
on
a
major
life
activity.
mr.
william
j.
kilberg
to
the
extent
that
the
ameliorative
measure...
in
this
case,
we're
talking
about
pills...
in
fact
put
them
on
the
other
side
of
the
line.
that
is
to
say,
with
their
medication
they
were
not
substantially
limited
in
a
major
life
activity.
some
of
those
conditions
you
name
can
be
very
severe,
so
that
even
with
medication--
mr.
william
j.
kilberg
--it
could
be
in
that
category.
it
is
not
with
regard
to
mr.
murphy.
mr.
william
j.
kilberg
no.
[laughter]
mr.
william
j.
kilberg
the
answer
is
yes,
i
would
comment,
and
no,
i
don't
believe
that
we
need
to
look
at
the
legislative
history.
mr.
william
j.
kilberg
well--
[laughter]
the...
for
a...
first--
mr.
william
j.
kilberg
--first,
because
the
statute
is
clear.
the
plain
meaning
of
the
statute
is
clear.
mr.
william
j.
kilberg
and
i
believe
it's
clear
on
regarded
as.
if
you
turn
to
the
legislative
history,
what
you're
going
to
see
is
a
mixed
record,
with
the
senate
reports
supporting
respondent's
position,
ups'
position,
and
with
the
house
reports
being
somewhat
mixed,
but
at
least
having
language
that
petitioners
can
use
to
argue
their
case.
we
don't
think
that
it's
necessary
in
this
case
to
go
beyond
the
plain
meaning
of
the
statutory
language.
mr.
william
j.
kilberg
the...
frankly,
because
the
agency's
interpretation
itself
doesn't
have
the
power
to
persuade.
it's
internally
inconsistent,
it's
inconsistent
with
their
own
regulations.
mr.
william
j.
kilberg
in
fact,
even
there,
justice
souter,
you
have
to
say
that
the
agency
is
taking
diametrically
opposed
positions.
the
agency
takes
the
position
that
mitigating
measures
may
be
taken
into
account
if
they're
harmful.
petitioner
and
the
solicitor
general
take
the
opposite
position
on
that.
the
agency
took
a
different
position
in
a
case
it
ruled
upon
3
months
before
the
ada
was
passed,
the
kienast
v.
frank
case,
which
is
cited
in
our
brief,
where
the
agency
said,
in
ruling
upon
a
case
coming
to
it
from
the
postal
service,
that
mitigating
measures
were
to
be
taken
into
account,
so
the
agency
frankly
is
all
over
the
place.
i
don't
see--
mr.
william
j.
kilberg
--no.
the
mitigating
measure
in
kienast
v.
frank
was
eye
glasses.
mr.
william
j.
kilberg
and
the
position
that
the
eeoc
took
was
that...
i
forget
whether
it...
it
was
ms.
kienast,
because
frank
was
the
postmaster
general,
that
ms.
kienast
was
not
disabled
because
she
was
able
to
wear
glasses.
