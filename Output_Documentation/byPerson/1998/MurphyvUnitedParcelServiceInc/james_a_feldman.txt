mr.
james
a.
feldman
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
when
congress
enacted
the
ada,
it
intended
to
cover
people
who
have
epilepsy
or
diabetes,
people
who
can
only
walk
with
the
assistance
of
prosthetic
devices,
and
people
like
mr.
murphy,
who
has
a
very
severe
case
of
hypertension,
intended
to
cover
those
individuals
even
if
they
can
take
mitigating
measures
that
alleviate
some
of
the
hardships
that
are
caused
by
their
conditions.
it
is,
in
fact,
precisely
because
their
conditions
cause
those
hardships
that
they
take
the
mitigating
measures.
now,
that
doesn't
mean
that
those
individuals
are
going
to
win
every
claim
that
they
bring.
it
still
has
to
be
shown
that
they
can
perform
the
essential
functions
of
their
job.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
right,
and
i
think
that
under
respondent's
view
of
the
statute
there
would
be
a
lot
fewer
than
43
million.
i'm
not
sure
how
many
exactly
there
are
going
to
be,
because
i
don't
know
any
way
to
count
all
of
the
claims
that
might
come
up
under
our
view
of
the
statute.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
it
came
from--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--i'm
not
aware
that
actually
the
43
million
figure
itself
came
from
any
specific
source,
or
at
least
i'm
not
sure
exactly
what
it
is.
there
are...
there
were
a
number
of...
there
was
a
number
of
different
studies
that
preceded
congressional
action,
and
it's
clear
congress
did
just
take
that
number.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
i
think
maybe
that...
that
may
well
be.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
right.
i
think
the--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--i...
mr.
chief
justice,
i'm
not
able
to
enlighten
you
any
further
as
to
the
precise
sources
of
that
particular
number,
but
what
i
can
say
is
that
there...
that
our
view
doesn't
necessarily
lead
to
any
larger
number
than
that
being
disabled,
and
that
respondent's
view
clearly
leads
to
a
smaller
number,
i
think,
a
smaller
number
than
that,
people
who
can
only
walk
with
prosthetic
devices,
who
have
epilepsy
or
diabetes,
the
kinds
of
serious
conditions
that
congress
intended
the
ada--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--no,
but
to
take,
for
example,
one
of
the
examples
that's
given
in
the
eeoc's
regulations,
if
you
take
someone
who
can
only
walk
with
an
artificial
leg,
who
has
only
a
partial
leg
and
needs
a
prosthetic
device
in
order
to
walk,
i
think
respondents
would
be
arguing
that
person
is
not
disabled,
because
if
he
straps
on
the
artificial
leg
he
can
actually
walk
pretty
well.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
well--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--right,
but
i
think--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--but...
no,
but
i...
no,
i'm
not,
but
i--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--no,
i'm
not,
but
i
think
the
lower
courts,
some
lower
courts,
since
the
enactment
but
not
before
the
enactment
of
the
ada,
have
held
that
conditions
such
as
epilepsy
and
diabetes
are
not
disabilities
because
individuals
can
take
medication
for
those
illnesses,
and
i
do
think
that,
as
prostheses
are
getting
better,
and
there
will
definitely
be
arguments,
and
i
think
respondents--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--that's--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--well,
with...
if
the
court
were
to
adopt
a
reasonable
interpretation
of
the
regarded-as
prong,
which
i
don't
think
is
the
interpretation
that
in
my
view
respondent
has
advanced,
it
would
take
some
of
the
pressure
off
of
the
first
prong,
so
insofar
as
that's
true,
i'd
agree
with
you.
nonetheless,
it
still
is
true
that
i
think
congress,
when
it
enacted
the
statute,
used
language
about
substantially
limiting
a
major
life
activity
which
i
think
is
open
to
either
interpretation.
the
committee
reports,
three
different
committee
reports
made
quite
clear
that
that
meant
that
mitigating
measures
were
not
supposed
to
be
included
when
you're
considering
whether
someone
has
a
disability.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
yes.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
there...
no.
there
is
a
qualification,
and
the
qualification
is,
it
has
to
be
a
class
of
jobs
or
a
range
of
jobs
in
a
variety
of
classes.
if
it's
just
a
particular
job,
if
there
is
someone
who...
i
mean,
one
of
the
examples
in
the
pre-ada
case
is
an
accountant
who
has
agoraphobia.
if
an
employer
has
a
job
only
on
the
37th
floor
and
says,
i'm
not
going
to
give
you
that
job
because
you
have
agoraphobia,
that
could
reasonably
be
seen
as
saying
you're
excluded
from
only
a
particular
job,
and
we're
not
viewing
you
as
disabled
in
the
major
life
activity--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--but
i
think
that
the
company
is
viewing
those
individuals
as
unable
to...
if
they're
otherwise
the
type
of
people
they
would
be
employing
for
truck
driver...
for
a
broad
range...
a
broad
job
category
like
truck
drivers
or
something--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--i
don't
think
that
that's
true.
i
don't
think
that
that's
true.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
the
reason
it's
not
true,
because
i
think
that
companies
would
have
to
prove
that
those
kinds
of
qualifications
for
jobs,
if
they
affect
a
broad
category
of
jobs,
are
things
that
can
be
justified
under
the
statute.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
james
a.
feldman
i
think
you
look
at
the...
at
whether
there's
a
class
of
jobs
involved.
you
don't
look--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--right.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
no.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
no,
i...
yes.
i
think
being
excluded
from--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--yes.
being
excluded
from
a
class
of
jobs
which
are
the
natural
jobs
that
you
have
the
training,
skills
and
experience
to
do,
i
think
that
is
substantially
limiting
in
the
major
life
activity
of
working.
as
the
court
said
in
bragdon,
the
act
doesn't
deal
with
utter
inabilities,
but
just
substantial
limitations.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
fixing
trucks.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
let
me
make...
let
me
distinguish
between
two
things.
what
the
lower
court
held
is
that
because
ups
viewed
murphy
as
unable
to
satisfy
the
dot
safety
regulations,
it
therefore
did
not
regard
him
as
substantially
limited
in
employment.
that's
the
holding
of
both
of
the
lower
courts
below,
and
that's
the
only
holding
that
either
of
them--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--a
major
life
activity.
working
is
a
major
life
activity.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
well,
not
every
individual
may
have
each
of
the
listed
major
life
activities.
it...
but
certainly
for
murphy
working,
and
certainly
for
most
of
us
working
is
a
major
life
activity,
but
what
i'd
like
to
distinguish
is
between
that
holding,
which
is
wrong,
the
holding
that
because
he
can't
satisfy
the
dot
regulation,
he
therefore
was
not
regarded
as
a
major...
as
a
limited
in
the
major
life
activity
of
working,
with
a
second
point
which
ups
has
made
in
its
briefs
in
this
court
but
which
wasn't
reached
in
the
courts
below,
and
that's
the
question
of
whether
the
class
of
jobs
involved
in
this
particular
case
that
ups
viewed
murphy
as
unable
to
do,
whether
that
was
sufficiently
broad.
that's
an
issue
that
hasn't...
that
it
seems
to
me
to
be
in
dispute
at
this
point,
and
neither
court
below
looked
at
the
summary
judgment
record
and
made
any
analysis
on
that
point,
and
so
therefore
i
think
an
appropriate
course
with
respect
to
that
would
be
to
remand
the
case
to
the
lower
courts.
i
mean,
to
be
a
little
bit
more
specific,
what
murphy--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--thank
you.
