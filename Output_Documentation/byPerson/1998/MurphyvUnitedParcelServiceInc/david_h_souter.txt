justice
david
h.
souter
but
mr.
mcallister,
the
concept
of
disability
requires
some
reference
to
the
average.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
i
presume
that
by
means
of
that
referenced
you
would
exclude
from
the
class
of
the
disabled
myopic
people
like
justice
scalia.
[laughter]
i
refer
to
his
glasses.
and
if
you--
justice
david
h.
souter
i'll
do
even
better
than
that.
if
you
exclude
such
people
as
justice
scalia
and
me,
by
reference
to
that...
to
the
criterion
of
average,
is
there
any
reason
to
think
that
the
43
million
doesn't
work
out
even
on
your
theory?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
isn't
the
question
not
whether
they
perceived
him
in
a
subjective
sense,
but
how
they
treated
him?
isn't
that
what
regarded
means,
did
they
treat
him
as
if
he
were
disabled?
justice
david
h.
souter
don't
believe
they
did
treat
him,
or
don't
believe
that
that's
the--
justice
david
h.
souter
--so
that
you
believe
the
reading
for
regarded
is
in
effect
subjective
state
of
mind?
justice
david
h.
souter
then
the
results
are
going
to
be
extraordinarily
disparate,
i
suppose,
because
in
the
one...
i
mean,
take
this
case.
take
this
case.
if,
on
your
view
in
their
heart
of
hearts
they
said,
oh,
this
guy's
just
as
disabled
as
he
ever
was,
the
statute
covers.
if,
on
the
other
hand,
they
say,
look,
we're
going
to
treat
him
as
disabled
and
we're
going
to
do
it
because
we
have
a
view,
perhaps
erroneous,
perhaps
correct,
of
what
dot
requires,
then
you're
going
to
get
a
different
result,
and
it
seems
to
me
you
would
get
kind
of
an
odd
patchwork
of
application
if
you
take
your
subjective
view.
justice
david
h.
souter
could
we
go
back
to
justice--
justice
david
h.
souter
--i'm...
are
you
done?
justice
david
h.
souter
could
we
go
back
to
justice
ginsburg's
question?
let's
assume
we
had
a
case
in
which
there...
we
did
not
have
the
feature
of
the
dot
regulation,
and
the
question
was,
number
1,
did
they
regard
the
person
as
disabled,
and
the
answer
was
yes,
was
the
person
qualified.
don't
the
two
questions
in
effect
merge,
because
if
they
regard
the
person
as
disabled,
i
assume
they
are
doing
it
for
an
illegitimate
reason.
if
the
person
is
qualified,
that
in
effect
is
another
way
of
saying
the
reason
was
illegitimate,
so
could
you
give
me
an
example
of
a
case
in
which
the
employer
would
fail
the
deemed...
the
regarded
prong
and
win
on
the
qualification
prong?
justice
david
h.
souter
in
other
words,
it
was...
you
regarded
the
person
as
disabled,
but
it
was
perfectly...
given
the
definitions
of
disabled,
but
the
person
was
nonetheless
not
qualified.
well,
that
might
be
this
very
case,
if
the
statute
contemplates
that
an
employer
can
rely
on
other
government
regulations
or
employment
requirements
such
as
the
requirement
of
dot
that
no
driver
can
have
hypertension
above
a
certain
level.
but
the
assumption
of
the
question
was
that
we
get
dot
out
of
here.
how
do
the
two...
how
do
those
two
standards
work
if
we
don't
have
a
government
regulation
superimposed
on
this,
that
the
employer
can
say,
well,
i'm
not
doing
the
deeming,
dot
is
doing
the
deeming.
assume
no
dot.
how
does
it
work?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
i
would
think
that
in
every
case
in
which
the
court
ultimately
said
yes,
the
person
is
qualified,
the
court
would
in
effect
be
saying,
your
basis
for
deeming
the
person
unqualified
was
an
illegitimate
basis.
that's
why
i...
the
two
seemed
to
me
to
be
virtually
inseparable
unless
you
get,
as
justice
o'connor
said,
a
kind
of
a
third
party
criterion
working
as
your
reason
for
defending
against
the
regarded.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
if
we
do
go
beyond
it,
and
i
agree
with
you,
i
looked
at
the
legislative
history,
and
i
think
it
takes
you
in
each
direction.
i
can't
get
any
help
from
it.
if
we
agree
with
you
on
the
legislative
history,
we
don't
agree
with
you
on
plain
meaning,
why
don't
we
defer?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
we
may
say
that...
i'm
not
saying
this,
but
we
may
say
they
have
done
a
far
less
than
perfect
job
in
the
consistency
of
their
regs,
and
i...
you
know,
i
understand
your
argument
there,
but
there
isn't
any
question
the
position
that
the
agency
is
taking
in
relation,
not
only
to
this
case,
but
to
cases
of
a
class
like
this,
and
isn't
that
enough
for
some
degree
of
deference
if
we're
looking
for
a
tie-breaker?
justice
david
h.
souter
and
in
that
case
there
were
no
side
effects
from
the
mitigating
measure
that
would
have
justified
it
on
their
theory.
justice
david
h.
souter
i
see.
