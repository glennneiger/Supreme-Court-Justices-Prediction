well,
if
we
were
to
decide
that
the
statute
contemplates
looking
at
it
in
the
medicated
state,
is
he
still
limited
in
his
major
life
activities
even
medicated,
because
as
i
understand
it,
it
doesn't
fully
correct
his
condition.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
you
would
suggest
that
we
make
the
assumption--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--then
that
in
his
fully
medicated
state
he
can
function.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--but
you
say
that
even
if
that's...
even
if
we
look
at
it
from
the
standpoint
of
his
medicated
state,
if
he's
regarded
by
the
employer
as
being
disabled,
that's
enough,
of
course,
under
the
statute.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--it's
an
easier
case
to
think
about,
perhaps,
in
thinking
about
one
that
will
be
argued
later
this
week,
20/20
vision
if
you
wear
glasses,
but
without
them,
terrible,
terrible
handicap.
why
shouldn't
we
look
at
it
as
though
the
person
were
wearing
glasses
to
determine
whether
there's
a
disability?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
but
i
think
the
regarded
as
feature
protects
the
person
who
alleges
the
disability,
notwithstanding
the
corrective
measures.
is
the
employer
regarding
the
person
as
disabled
nonetheless?
i
mean,
that
really
hits
at
the
heart
of
what
the
statute
was
aimed
at.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
you
did
raise,
i
take
it,
and
we
granted
cert
on
the
question
whether
there
was
a
genuine
factual
dispute
about
whether
respondent
regarded
the
petitioner
as
disabled--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--and
fired
him
for
that
reason,
so
if
we
disagree
with
you
on
the
first
question
and
think
you
do
consider
it
in
the
medicated
state,
we
might
conclude
that
the
court
below
erred
on
the
regarded
as
prong.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
but
you
still
have
the
regarded-as
prong,
mr.
feldman,
to
protect
against
mistaken
beliefs
as
to
the
person's
ability,
and
i
would
think
that
that
would
make
the
scheme
work
pretty
well,
and
then
if
he's
regarded
as
disabled,
despite
the
corrective
measures,
you
have
a
question
of
whether
he's
qualified,
nonetheless,
and
the
scheme
works.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
don't
see
why
it's
either
necessary
or
desirable
to
adopt
your
view
of
the
meaning
of
the
first
question.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
of
course
the
statute--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
don't
know
why
you'd
want
to
get
into
anything
like
that.
the
statute
either
is
all
or
not.
i
mean,
you
either
correct
it
or
you
don't,
and
if
you
look
at
it
in
its
corrected
state,
you
still
have
to
make
an
individualized
determination,
don't
you--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--under
the
statute?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
it
could
be
that
someone
takes
medication,
but
it
doesn't
totally
cure
the
problem
and
the
person
is
still
disabled,
and
you
would
look
at
the
individual
circumstance,
would
you
not--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--under
the
statute?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
i
would
think
the
employer's
treatment
of
mr.
murphy
itself
is
some
evidence
of
their
attitude
that
he
wasn't
qualified,
and
i
don't
understand
how
a
summary
judgment
could
have
been
rendered
on
that
issue
on
these
facts.
i
would
think
that
would
be
open
to
litigation,
and
then
you
would
have
to
ultimately
determine
whether
he
was
qualified
or
not.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--that
depends
on
how
you
interpret
the
statutory
requirement,
a
class
of
jobs.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
we
have
a
case
coming
up
that
gets
us
into
that
i
think--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--in
a
day
or
so.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
the
second
case,
another
ada
case,
is
murphy
versus
united
parcel
service,
no.
97-1992.
this
case
comes
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
tenth
circuit.
the
respondent,
united
parcel
service,
dismissed
the
petitioner
vaughn
murphy
from
his
job
as
a
mechanic
because
of
his
hypertension.
the
petitioner
filed
suit
under
title
i
of
the
ada
in
federal
district
court.
the
district
court
granted
summary
judgment
to
the
respondent
and
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
tenth
circuit
affirmed.
it
held
that
the
petitioner's
hypertension
is
not
a
disability,
because
he
functions
normally
when
he
is
medicated.
the
court
also
held
the
petitioner
is
not
regarded
as
disabled
under
the
ada.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
we
affirm.
the
first
question
is
whether
the
determination
of
petitioner's
disability
is
made
with
reference
to
the
mitigating
measures
he
employs.
we
have
answered
that
question
in
the
sutton
case
just
announced
in
the
affirmative.
given
that
holding
the
result
in
this
case
is
clear.
the
court
of
appeals
concluded
that
when
medicated
petitioner's
hypertension
does
not
substantially
limit
him
in
any
major
life
activity.
petitioner
did
not
seek
certiorari
on
whether
that
conclusion
was
correct.
so,
we
conclude
the
court
of
appeals
correctly
affirmed
the
grant
of
summary
judgment
in
respondent's
favor.
petitioner
also
argues
that
he
was
regarded
as
disabled
by
respondent
because
of
his
hypertension.
to
support
that
claim
he
points
to
testimony
from
respondent's
resource
manager
that
respondent
fired
petitioner
due
to
his
hypertension,
which
he
claims
evidences
respondent's
belief
that
the
hypertension
and
consequent
inability
to
obtain
certification
from
the
department
of
transportation
to
drive
commercial
motor
vehicles
substantially
limits
his
ability
to
work.
as
we
held
in
sutton
a
person
is
regarded
as
disabled
within
the
meaning
of
the
ada,
if
a
covered
entity
mistakenly
believes
that
person's
actual,
nonlimiting
impairment
substantially
limits
one
or
more
major
life
activities.
assuming
arguendo,
that
unchallenged
regulations
issued
by
the
equal
employment
opportunity
commission
are
correct,
to
be
regarded
as
substantially
limited
in
the
major
life
activity
of
working,
one
must
be
regarded
as
precluded
from
a
class
of
jobs.
here
the
evidence
that
petitioner
is
regarded
as
unable
to
meet
the
department
of
transportation
regulations
is
not
sufficient
to
create
a
genuine
issue
of
material
fact
as
to
whether
he
is
regarded
as
unable
to
perform
a
class
of
jobs
utilizing
his
skills.
there
is
no
evidence
that
petitioner
is
unable
to
perform
mechanics
jobs
that
do
not
call
for
driving
a
commercial
vehicle.
we
conclude
that
petitioner
has
failed
to
show
he
is
regarded
as
disabled.
justice
stevens
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
which
justice
breyer
has
joined.
