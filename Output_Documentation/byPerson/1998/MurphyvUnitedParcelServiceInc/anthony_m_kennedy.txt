well,
could
the
agency
say
that
substantially
limits
is
very
easily
complied
with,
you
just
put
your
glasses
on
and
off,
but
in
other
cases,
medication
has
to
be
taken
in
a
certain
dosage,
and
you
have
to
be
very,
very
careful
about
it,
and
so
that
there's
a
distinction
in
the
two?
i'm
just...
i
suppose
they
could
try
to
tease
that
meaning
out
of
the
text.
i
think
it's
difficult,
but--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--yes.
