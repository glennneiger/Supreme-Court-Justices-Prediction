mr.
michael
j.
lightfoot
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
pleased
the
court:
our
contention
has
been,
from
the
time
that
we
filed
the
complaint
in
this
matter,
throughout
the
course
of
the
litigation,
that
the
prosecutor's
action
here
was
to
intentionally
time
the
execution
of
the
search
warrant
so
as
to
prevent
mr.
gabbert
from
giving
counsel
to
his
client
outside
the
grand
jury,
and
specifically
with
respect
to
her
potential
invocation
of
the
fifth
amendment.
and
ultimately,
it
was
the
purpose
of
the
prosecutors
to
get
her,
the
client,
to
reveal
information
to
the
grand
jury
that
she
was
otherwise
reluctant
to
do.
mr.
michael
j.
lightfoot
our
allega...
the
answer
is
no,
your
honor.
our
allegations
in
the
complaint
reflect
that
their
actions
deprived
him
of
being
available,
to
be
of
assistance
to
her,
at
the
times
when
she
was
allowed
to
leave
the
grand
jury.
mr.
michael
j.
lightfoot
there...
there
were,
your
honor.
there
were
depositions
of
mr.
gabbert,
the...
the
two
defendants.
in
fact,
all
the
parties
who
were
involved
in
the
search,
as
well
as
miss
baker,
the
grand
jury
witness
and
the
client
of
mr.
gabbert.
mr.
gabbert
testified
that
he
was
taken
approximately
40
feet
away
from
the
grand
jury
room,
and
that
the
process
of
the
execution
took
a
period
of
time.
it
was,
as...
as
the
court
may
know,
we've
indicated
in
the
briefs,
the--
mr.
michael
j.
lightfoot
--he
did,
your
honor,
that's
correct.
and
then
he
was
taken
away
from
the
entrance
to
the
grand
jury
room,
where
he
was
standing
with
his
client,
and
taken
to
an
available
room
in
the
environs
of
the
grand
jury,
which
was,
according
to
her
testimony,
three
to
five
car
lengths'
away
from
mr.
gabbert.
mr.
michael
j.
lightfoot
with
all
due
respect,
justice
ginsburg,
that's
not
what
the
evidence
indicates.
when
she
first
walked
into
the
grand
jury
while
he
was...
he
was
being
searched
down
the
hall,
she
was
asked
a
question
about
her
relationship
with
lyle
menendez.
her
response
was:
my
lawyer
is
in
the
process
of
being
searched.
i
have
had
not
had
an
opportunity
to...
to
seek
his
counsel.
may
i
leave
and
seek
his
counsel?
she
was
allowed
by
the
foreperson
to
leave.
when
she
left
the
room,
she
couldn't
find
him.
an
employee
of
the
district
attorney's
office
went
down
to
mr.
gabbert,
told
mr.
gabbert
that
his
client
was
looking
for
him.
they
never...
he...
mr.
gabbert
never
conversed
with
his
client.
he
called
out:
i'm
in
the
process
of
being
searched.
they're
going
to
have
to
wait.
she
then--
mr.
michael
j.
lightfoot
--well,
you
know,
your
honor,
she
was
a
24-year-old
young
waitress,
very
unsophisticated.
he
was
in
the
process--
mr.
michael
j.
lightfoot
--your
honor,
what--
mr.
michael
j.
lightfoot
--twenty
minutes
to
a
half
an
hour.
he
had
with
him,
your
honor,
he
had
the
file
in
this
case
which
included
his
interview
notes
of
his
interview
with
the
client,
which
the...
despite
the
objections
of
mr.
gabbert,
were
read
in
their
entirety
by
the
special
master.
he--
mr.
michael
j.
lightfoot
--no,
your
honor.
but
mr.
gabbert
consistently
made
the
claim
that
under
california
law,
section
1524,
the
statute
under
which
the
search
was
being
conducted,
that
once
he
invoked
the
privilege,
under
that
law,
the
search
has
to
stop.
and
the
master
continued
to
read...
as
a
matter
of
fact,
one
of
the
reasons,
as
indicated
in
the
complaint,
that
did
not
allow
mr.
gabbert
to
leave
the
room
was
that
the
special
master,
who
was
in
possession
of
the
documents,
insisted
on
copying
the
interview
notes
that
mr.
gabbert
had
made
during
his
interview
with
the
client.
mr.
michael
j.
lightfoot
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
j.
lightfoot
we...
we
pled
it
under
the
independent
jurisdiction
of
the
federal
court.
and
it
was
dismissed
by
the
trial
court
as
being
a
novel
claim
that
had
not
yet
been
recognized
in
the
california
courts.
mr.
michael
j.
lightfoot
we
did,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
j.
lightfoot
we
did,
your
honor,
but
not
on
the
basis
of
the
timing
of
the
search,
so
as
to
prevent
him
from
giving
counsel
to
his
client.
mr.
michael
j.
lightfoot
well,
your
honor,
we
didn't...
we
don't
see
this
as
a...
as
a...
as
particularly
a
fourth
amendment
problem.
mr.
michael
j.
lightfoot
your
honor,
i...
i
assume
that
your
honor
is
referring
to
the
albright
v.
oliver
and
graham
v.
connor.
and
my
understanding
of
the
holdings
in
those
cases
is
that
where
there
is
a
textual
source
in
the
bill
of
rights
for
the
particular
behavior
that
we
raise
as
being
violative
of
our
client's
constitutional
rights,
then
we
should
pursue
that
particular
violation.
mr.
michael
j.
lightfoot
because
our
claim,
your
honor,
does
not
have
to
do
with
the
manner
in
which
they
seized
the
evidence.
mr.
michael
j.
lightfoot
because,
your
honor,
it's
my
understanding
that
the
fourth
amendment
guards
against
unreasonable
activity
in
the
procuring
of
evidence.
we
are
concentrating
on
the
behavior
of
the
prosecutors
in
separating
mr.
gabbert
from
his
client.
it's...
it's
the
same
as
if
they
had
locked
them
on
an
elevator
or
told
him,
as
he
was
standing
outside
the
grand
jury
room,
that
there
was
a
death
in
his
family
to
get
him
out
of
the
building
so
that--
mr.
michael
j.
lightfoot
--well,
we
haven't,
your
honor.
we...
i...
i'm
saying
honestly
to
the
court
that
we
filed
fourth
amendment
claims
with
respect
to
the
search
that
took
place
40
feet--
mr.
michael
j.
lightfoot
--and
we
did
not
pursue
that
as
one
of
the
bases,
because
we
thought
that
it
more
properly
fell
within
the
due
process
clause.
mr.
michael
j.
lightfoot
it
is,
justice
o'connor.
mr.
michael
j.
lightfoot
if
i
were
bound
to...
to
identify
one
case,
it
would
be
meyer
v.
nebraska,
decided
in
1923,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
j.
lightfoot
well,
your
honor,
you
know,
respectfully,
i
don't
think
it
is
a
far
cry.
what
we're
talking
about
is
we're...
we
know,
going
back
into
the
last
century,
that
everyone
has
a
due
process
right
to
practice
a
profession
or
to
engage
in
the
calling
of
one's
choice.
mr.
michael
j.
lightfoot
going
back
to
the
dent
case,
in
the
1890's,
the
1915
case
of
truax
v.
raich--
mr.
michael
j.
lightfoot
--your
honor,
the...
the
case
that
was
decided
in
1923,
the
meyer
v.
nebraska,
was
a
case
that
was
a
direct
appeal
of
a
man
who
was
the
teacher
and
convicted
of
the
crime
of
teaching
in
german
during
a
small
portion
of
his
teaching
day,
approximately
a
half
an
hour.
mr.
michael
j.
lightfoot
well,
that's
the...
that's
the
closest
case
in
the
supreme
court.
there...
there's
a
case
in
the
eighth
circuit,
decided
in...
in
1974;
wounded
knee
v.
fbi,
a
1983
case,
where
the
court
held
that
there
was
a
constitutional
right
to
practice
law
that
was
interfered
with.
mr.
michael
j.
lightfoot
not
at
all,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
j.
lightfoot
we...
for
purposes
of
this
argument,
we
do,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
j.
lightfoot
but...
but,
your
honor,
we're
not...
we
don't
claim
that
every
time
an
attorney
is
searched
that
there's
a
due
process
violation.
this
search
occurred
at
the
precise...
and
this
is
what
the
ninth
circuit
held...
at
the
precise
moment
in
time
when
the
lawyer
was
retained
to
represent
the
witness--
mr.
michael
j.
lightfoot
--but,
your
honor,
it
was
made
clear
to
the
prosecutors
as
early
as
the
day
the...
the
subpoena
was
served
on
the
lawyer
that
she
had
a
fifth
amendment
right
to
refuse
production.
which
was
ultimately...
that
was
the
ruling
of
the
california
court.
it
was...
it
was
a
clear
example
of
her...
her
exercising
her
fifth
amendment
right.
and
so,
when
he...
when
mr.
gabbert
came
to
court
with
his
client
on
the
morning...
the
following
monday
morning,
of
course
she
intended
to
exercise
her
fifth
amendment
right,
if
he
had
been
allowed
to
counsel
her,
and
refuse
to
produce
it.
mr.
michael
j.
lightfoot
that's
correct.
mr.
michael
j.
lightfoot
she
didn't.
and
it
was
fortuitous,
your
honor.
but
she
never
had
the
opportunities
to
get
the
counsel,
the
advice
from
her
lawyer,
that
she
had...
had
retained
him
for
and
for
which
he
was
there
to
give
her.
mr.
michael
j.
lightfoot
well,
it
depends,
your
honor,
on
what...
i
mean,
the
reason
that
the
lawyer
is
there...
you...
a
lawyer,
to
act
professionally,
must
understand
what
the
question
is
before
he
can
legitimately
counsel
his
client
to
invoke
the
fifth
amendment.
if
she
was
asked
questions
that
did
not...
did
not
call
for
answers
that
might
tend
to
incriminate
her,
she
was
duty
bound
to
answer
those
questions
truthfully.
mr.
michael
j.
lightfoot
well--
mr.
michael
j.
lightfoot
--well,
it's
fortuitous
that
it
happened
that
way,
your
honor.
but
when
he
went
to
the
grand
jury,
she
had
no
idea
what
questions
would
be
asked,
nor
did
he.
and
it
was
his
right
to
be
there,
to
counsel
her,
as
she
came
out.
she
had
a
right
to
leave
the
grand
jury
and
seek
his
advice.
he
was
protecting
her--
mr.
michael
j.
lightfoot
--well,
your
honor,
this...
in--
mr.
michael
j.
lightfoot
--in
1976,
in
the
mondujano
case,
this
court
said,
with
regard
to
the
prosecutor's
admonition
to
a
target
before
a
federal
grand
jury:
you
have
the
right
to
leave
the
room
and
seek
the
advice
and
consult
with
counsel.
and
this
court
said
that
is
a
correct
recital
of
the
law.
and
every
circuit
since
that
time
has
pointed
to
that
language--
mr.
michael
j.
lightfoot
--well,
it
didn't
say
a
constitutional
right,
your
honor.
but
i
can't...
but
we
know--
mr.
michael
j.
lightfoot
--well,
justice
breyer,
i
would...
i
would
respectfully
disagree.
when...
when
the
lawyer
went
to
the
grand
jury
with
his
client
at
that
moment
in
time,
he
had
a
right.
we
know,
going
back
to
the
jurisprudence
of
this
court,
going
back
to
the
1950's,
in
annis
v.
myers,
that
this
court
found
that
the
fifth
amendment
is
drained
of
any
significance
at
all
if
the
lawyer
isn't
there
to
assist
the
client
in
how
to
decide
whether
or
not
to
invoke
it.
it's
not
self-executing.
mr.
michael
j.
lightfoot
well,
justice
ginsburg,
the
only
opportunity
he
had
was
when
the
district
attorney's
employee...
and
i...
i've
indicated
this
to
the
court
already...
told
him
that
his...
his
client
wanted
to
talk
to
him.
he
said
to
the
d...
district
attorney's
employee,
they're
going
to
have
to
wait...
obviously
referring
to
the
course
of
the
grand
jury
proceedings...
until
the
master
finishes
with
his
search
of
me,
because
i'm...
i'm
being
occupied
here.
and
as
we
indicate
in
our
brief,
if
you're
the
subject
of
process,
you
don't
have
the
right
to
walk
away,
to
take--
mr.
michael
j.
lightfoot
--well,
in
hindsight,
your
honor,
maybe
that
would
have
been
the
best
course.
but
at...
at
the
moment
in
time,
as
he
indicated
in
his
deposition,
he
was...
his...
his
attention
was
to
the...
the
search
that
was
taking
place,
which
involved
not
only
attorney-client
documents
that
related
to
miss
baker,
but
to
two
other
clients,
as
well.
and
the
master
insisted
on
reading
all
the
documents
in
those
files.
mr.
michael
j.
lightfoot
because,
your
honor,
the
actions
of
the
prosecutors
amount
to
a
serious,
serious
subversion
of
the
adversary
system
here.
when
mr.
gabbert--
mr.
michael
j.
lightfoot
--because
my
answer,
your
honor,
is
that
the
core
of
the
behavior
that
we
claim
amounts
to
the
constitutional
violation
is
the
action
of
the
prosecutors
in
stepping
in
and
subverting
the
right
of
the
lawyer
to
give
advice
as
to
the
invocation
or
non-invocation
of
the
fifth
amendment
by
his
client.
that...
the
prosecutors
know
from
the
moment
they
take
an
oath,
in
california,
that
they
are
to
support
the
state
and
federal
constitution.
the
defense
lawyer's
role,
in
california
and
elsewhere
in
this
country,
is
to
protect
the
client.
the
client
has
a
constitutional
right,
before
a
grand
jury,
to
invoke
the
fifth
amendment.
if
you
take
the
lawyer
away,
then
you
subvert
the
process.
it's
egregious
behavior
because,
as
the
ninth
circuit
indicated
in
this
case,
your
honor--
mr.
michael
j.
lightfoot
--your
honor,
our
claim
doesn't
rest
on
whether
or
not
ms.
baker
had
a
sixth
amendment
right
to
counsel.
she
was...
she
was
afforded
the
right,
under
practice
and
procedure
in
california,
to
leave
the
grand
jury.
you
can't
give
a
right
and
then--
mr.
michael
j.
lightfoot
--she
did,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
j.
lightfoot
if
the
production
itself
would
incriminate
you--
mr.
michael
j.
lightfoot
--if
the
act
of
production
would
tend...
you're
virtually
saying,
"these
are
my
documents",
that
verbal
conduct
is
incriminating.
and
that's
what
mr.
gabbert
had
indicated
to
the
prosecutors
beforehand;
asked
for
a
period
of
time
so
that
he
could
make
the
motion...
pursue
a
motion
to
quash
before
the
court,
which
was
denied.
when
he
did
attempt
to
file
the
motion
on...
on
the
friday
before
the
monday
appearance,
the
first
thing
the
prosecutors
did
was
to
get
a
search
warrant
and
go
out
themselves
and
search
through
her
apartment,
to
see
if
they
could
find
the
documents.
it
was
their
intent,
when
they
took
him
aside,
not
to
get
the
documents
from
him,
but
to
bring
her
in,
unrepresented,
and
get
her
to
waive
her
fifth
amendment
right,
and
give
them
the
opportunity
to
explore
her
relationship
with
lyle
menendez.
that's
what
our
theory
is.
they
could
have
done
that
a
number
of
ways.
the
way
they
chose
to
do
it
was
to
use
the
search
warrant
to
separate
them.
and
that's
what
we--
mr.
michael
j.
lightfoot
--i
believe
for
approximately
15
to
20
minutes.
she
was
allowed
to
leave
on
two
occasions,
and
remained
outside
the
grand
jury
before
she
was
ordered
to
come
back
in
and...
and
answer
questions.
mr.
michael
j.
lightfoot
it
does.
no,
it
includes...
she
was...
she
was
only
asked
four
questions,
your
honor,
during
the
course
of
her
appearance.
she
was
not
asked
about
the
documents.
and
as
the
court
knows,
the
search
warrant
that
the
prosecutors
got
on
the
morning
in
question
was
a
search
warrant
not
only
to
search
mr.
gabbert,
through
the
special
master,
but
to
search
miss
baker,
as
well,
for
the
documents.
they
had
the
special
master
there,
and
they
had
a
police
officer,
who
could
have
searched.
if
they
were
intent
on
finding
the
documents
on
the
person
of
miss
baker,
they
could
have
searched
her
outside
the
grand
jury
room.
they
didn't
do
that.
they
brought
her
in
and,
before
asking
her
to
produce
the
documents,
they
asked
her
questions
that
would
have
obviously
invoked
her...
her
right
not
to
give
testimony
that
would
intend
to
incriminate
her.
mr.
michael
j.
lightfoot
well,
there...
there
is,
your
honor.
because,
as
i
indicated
before,
they
put
this
search
in
motion
when
she
first
came
in
and
was
asked
a
question
about
her
relationship
with...
with
lyle
menendez.
he...
she
indicated,
my
client...
my
lawyer
is
not
available;
he
is
being
searched--
mr.
michael
j.
lightfoot
--she
went
out--
mr.
michael
j.
lightfoot
--well,
the
record
indicates,
your
honor,
that,
after
she
left
the
grand
jury
the
first
time,
that
the
two
prosecutors
left
the
grand
jury
room,
as
well.
so,
they
would
have
seen
her
out
in
the
hallway.
and
as
we
know,
it
was
one
of
the
employees
of
the
district
attorney's
office,
during
that
break,
who
actually
spoke
to
mr.
gabbert.
and
the
other
indication
is
that
mr.
oppenheim,
who
was
there,
having
been
picked
by
the
district
attorney's
office
as
the
special
master
to
perform
this
search,
he
never
came
back
and
reported
his
findings
until
after
her
appearances
before
the
grand
jury.
so--
mr.
michael
j.
lightfoot
--no,
he
would
report
to
the
prosecutors,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
j.
lightfoot
no,
your
honor.
there's
no
provision
in
the
statute
who
he
reports
to.
but
he
was
picked
by
the
district
attorney,
brought
to
the
building,
and
accompanied
the
district
attorneys
and
introduced
to
mr.
gabbert.
and
when
they...
when
he
ultimately
did
report
to
anybody,
he
reported
back
to
the
prosecutors
what
the
results
of
his
search
were.
mr.
michael
j.
lightfoot
well,
not...
not
all
of
that,
your
honor.
the
california
law
requires
that
when
the
master
first
approaches
the
lawyer
who
is
the
subject
of
the
warrant,
that
the
lawyer
be
given
the
opportunity
to
essentially
turn
it
into
a
subpoena
and
voluntarily
turn
the
documents
over.
which
is
exactly
what
mr.
gabbert
did
here.
he
had
copies
of
two
of
the
three
pages.
and
as
the
ninth
circuit
indicated,
his
first
act
was
to
turn
those
over
to
the
special
master.
but
the...
despite
the
mandate
of
the
california
statute,
the...
the
search
continued.
the
mandate
of
the
statute
is
that
if
at
any
point
the
lawyer
invokes
the
attorney-client
privilege
with
respect
to
any
of
the
materials,
then
it's
the
duty
of
the
master
to
seal
the
documents
and
take
them
to
a
court
for
that
court
to
resolve
the
disputes
with
respect
to
the
privilege.
and
as
we
know,
mr....
from
the
record...
mr.
gabbert
invoked
the
privilege
consistently
during
the
20
minutes
to
a
half
an
hour
that
the
search
took
place.
and
according
to
mr.
oppenheim,
the
master's
testimony,
because
the
documents
didn't
have
the
words
"attorney-client
privilege"
on
them,
he
didn't
view
them
as
privileged.
and
so,
when
he
went
back
to
the
prosecutors,
he
told
them
there
was
nothing
in
the
files
that
was
privileged.
and
that's
when
the
second
search
took
place
outside
the
grand
jury
room.
your
honor,
with
respect
to
the...
to
the
question
of
qualified
immunity,
the
petitioners
in
this
case
ask
this
court
to
set
down
a
rule
that
there
must
be
some
factual
correspondence
between
a
previous
case
of
this
court
and
the
facts
of
this
case.
that
suggestion
was
rejected,
explicitly...
explicitly
rejected...
by
this
court
in
1997,
in
the
lanier
case.
and
as
this
court
said
in...
in
lanier,
that
it
is...
it
is
not
unusual
for
the...
a
general
proposition
appearing
in
a
prior
supreme
court
case
to
be
sufficient
to
give
a
clear
or
fair
warning
of
what
the
constitutional
right
is.
and
as
this
court
remembers
in
lanier,
the...
the
right
that
was
involved
was
the
right
of
victims
not
to
be
subjected
to
sexual
abuse
by
a
state
judge.
and
the
authority
for
the...
the
previous
supreme
court
opinion
for...
that
set
out
that
right
was
rochen,
which,
as
the
court
knows,
was
a...
a
serious
physical
violation
of
the
person
of...
of
the
defendant
in
that
case.
but--
mr.
michael
j.
lightfoot
--i'm
sorry,
your
honor?
mr.
michael
j.
lightfoot
well,
we're...
we're
relying
on
meyer.
we're
relying
on
the
schware
case,
back
in
the
19...
v.
the
board
of
examiners
for
the
state
of
new
mexico,
which
held
that
a
person
has
a
right
to
practice
law.
that
was
a
procedural
due
process
case,
but
the
right
itself
was
the
right
to
practice
law.
we
rely
on
the
eighth
circuit
case
of--
mr.
michael
j.
lightfoot
--it
identified...
it
identified
a
right
that
mr.
schware
had
to
practice
law.
mr.
michael
j.
lightfoot
well,
he...
he
was...
he
was
pursuing
a
right
under
the...
the
liberty
clause
in
the
14th
amendment,
your
honor.
that's...
that's
exactly
what
we're...
what
we're
doing
here.
mr.
michael
j.
lightfoot
no,
your
honor.
but
this
court
has
never
held
that
there
has
to
be
a
total
ban
on
the
exercise
of
somebody's
right
before
it
gives
rise
to--
mr.
michael
j.
lightfoot
--may
i
respond
to
your
question,
justice
ginsburg?
mr.
michael
j.
lightfoot
your
honor,
that
may
be.
but
this
is
the
most
significant
moment
in
this
representation,
where
her
answer
to
a
question
may
be
irreversible
if
she
doesn't
get
the
right
advice
from
the
client.
and
that's
what
this...
that's
what
the
ninth
circuit
case
said
was
so
egregious
about
the
conduct
in...
in
this
case.
mr.
michael
j.
lightfoot
thank
you,
your
honor.
