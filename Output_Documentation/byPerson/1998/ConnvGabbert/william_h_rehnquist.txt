the
third
case
is
no.
97-1802,
conn
versus
gabbert.
this
case
arises
out
of
a
high
profile
california
murder
trials
of
the
menendez
brothers.
the
petitioners
david
conn
and
carol
najera
were
los
angeles
district
attorneys
working
on
the
case
and
the
respondent
paul
gabbert
is
a
criminal
defense
attorney.
the
prosecutors
believe
that
tracy
baker
one
of
gabbert’s
clients
had
perjured
herself
at
the
first
menendez’s
trial.
it
came
to
their
attention
that
baker
might
have
in
her
possession
a
letter
from
one
of
the
brothers
relevant
to
the
perjury
investigation.
so
baker
was
ordered
to
bring
the
letter
with
her
when
she
appeared
before
the
grand
jury.
on
that
day
the
prosecutors
executed
a
search
warrant
upon
gabbert
at
the
same
time
his
client
baker
was
testifying
before
the
grand
jury.
this
had
the
effect
of
preventing
baker
from
conferring
with
gabbert
during
her
testimony.
gabbert
believes
that
the
timing
and
execution
of
the
search
warrant
interfered
with
his
liberty
right
to
practice
law
protected
by
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
he
sued
the
prosecutors.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
held
that
gabbert
had
a
clearly
established
right
to
practice
his
profession
without
undue
and
unreasonable
government
interference
and
that
the
prosecutors
were
not
entitled
to
qualified
immunity.
we
disagree.
although
we
have
recognized
that
fourteenth
amendment
liberty
right
to
choose
and
follow
ones
calling,
we
find
no
support
in
our
cases
for
the
ninth
circuit’s
conclusion
that
the
fourteenth
amendment
right
asserted
by
gabbert
was
violated
in
this
case.
the
cases
which
do
establish
this
general
right
to
practice
ones
callings,
cases
like
truax
against
raich,
meyer
against
nebraska
dealt
with
complete
prohibitions
on
the
right
not
the
sort
of
brief
interruption
as
a
result
of
legal
process
which
occurred
here.
to
the
extent
that
gabbert
argued
that
the
use
of
a
search
warrant
interfered
with
his
clients
purported
right
to
have
him
present
outside
the
jury
room.
the
court
has
never
recognized
such
a
right
and
even
if
it
had
gabbert
would
have
no
standing
to
raise
any
alleged
violation
of
the
rights
of
his
client.
we
held
in
graham
against
conner
that
one
of
the
explicit
textural
provision
that
constitution
protects
the
right,
a
court
must
assess
a
plaintiff’s
claims
under
that
provision
and
not
under
the
generalized
substantive
due
process
protections
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
here
if
you
have
a
complaint
about
the
search
warrant,
early
comes
on
to
have
the
fourth
amendment
and
not
the
fourteenth
amendment,
and
we
did
not
grant
certiorari
on
the
fourth
amendment
claim.
so
the
judgment
on
ninth
circuit
is
reversed.
justice
stevens
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
the
judgment.
