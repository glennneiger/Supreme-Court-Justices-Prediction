mr.
kevin
c.
brazile
mr
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
to
answer
the
first
question
of
certiorari
raised
in
this
case,
there
has
to
be
a
determination
made
as
to
whether
or
not
petitioners
in
this
case
engaged
in
egregious
or
outrageous
conscience-shocking
conduct.
this
case,
and
the
case
of
county
of
sacramento
v
lewis,
as
well
as
the
case
of
washington
v
glucksberg,
has
set
forth
the
test
that
should
be
used
in...
in
making
the
analysis
in
a
substantive
due
process
case
such
as
this,
which
involves
executive
action.
what
the
court
has
told
us
is
that
we
look
to
the
historical
precedent,
we
look
to
the
case
precedent,
and
we
look
at
the
traditions
of
our
nation.
in
this
case,
the
liberty
interest
at
stake
is
the
question
of
whether
or
not
an
attorney
has
a
right
not
to
be
subject
to
a
search
at
the
time
his
client
is
testifying
before
the
grand
jury.
in
this
case,
the
ninth
circuit
found
that
the
search
warrant
was
in
fact
a
valid
warrant.
also,
at
this
juncture
of
the
proceeding,
this
was
a
grand
jury
proceeding;
there
had
been
no
charges
filed
against
miss
baker,
so
the
sixth
amendment
right
to
counsel
did
not
apply.
what
tradition
normally
requires
to
do
a
search
of
a
person,
whether
it
be
an
attorney
or
anyone
else,
is
in
fact
a
valid
search
warrant.
that's
what
occurred
in
this
case.
mr.
kevin
c.
brazile
justice
ginsburg,
no,
we...
justice
ginsburg,
no,
we
do
not.
in
this
case,
the
search
warrant
was
served
between
the
hours
that
the
warrant
authorized.
the
warrant
authorized
a
search
any
time
between
7:00
a.m.
and
10:
00
p.m.
in
the
evening.
the
warrant
was
executed
at
that
time.
it
was
a
valid
warrant.
and
when
miss
baker
was
before
the
grand
jury,
each
time
she
made
a
request
to
consult
with
her
attorney,
the
district
attorneys
and
the
grand
jury
foreperson
allowed
her
to
leave
the
grand
jury
in
order
to
consult
with
her
lawyer.
now,
according
to
this
court's
decision
in
u.s.
v.
williams,
she
had
no
right
to
have
that
lawyer
in
the
grand
jury
room
with
her.
and
it's
not
even
established
that
she
had
a
right
to
consult
with
him
outside
of
the
grand
jury
under
this
court's
case
law.
but
there
are
other
case
law
from
the
federal
circuits
that
do
allow
that...
that
the
witness
has
a
right
to
consult
with
her
lawyer.
mr.
kevin
c.
brazile
well,
there
is
a
sanction
for
this
type
of
conduct
if...
under
california
laws
and
many
others
states,
there
is
the
tort
of
abuse
of
process.
if
they
felt
that
the
warrant
was
used
for
the...
for
an
ulterior
motive,
in
an
abusive
way,
they
could
have
brought
a
tort
action
for
abuse
of
process.
so,
there
is
a
state
law
remedy
here.
mr.
kevin
c.
brazile
no,
your--
mr.
kevin
c.
brazile
--no,
your
honor,
we
do
not
concede
that
the
warrant
was
somehow
calculated
to
interfere
or
to
interrupt
with
mr.
gabbert's
practice
of
his
profession.
what
in
fact
happened
is,
earlier
in
the
morning,
when
they
were
up
in
the
district
attorney's
office,
mr.
gabbert
indicated
that
the
documents
that
were
requested
in
the
subpoena,
that
he
had
the
documents.
he
indicated
that
to
mr.
conn.
and
it
was
at
that
point
he
decided
to
go
and
to
get
the
warrant.
mr.
kevin
c.
brazile
justice
breyer--
mr.
kevin
c.
brazile
--well--
mr.
kevin
c.
brazile
--well,
justice--
mr.
kevin
c.
brazile
--just...
justice
stevens,
there
is
a
penal
code
section
that
applied
here,
that
requires,
when
you
serve
a
search
warrant
on
a...
on
a
lawyer,
there
are
certain
formalities
you
have
to
comply
with,
one
of
which
is...
is
getting
a
special
master
appointed.
so,
in
terms
of
getting
the
documents
from
mr.
gabbert,
they
did
get
a
special
master,
and
they
did
obtain
a
search
warrant
from
the
court.
that's
the
procedure
that's--
mr.
kevin
c.
brazile
--i
do
have--
mr.
kevin
c.
brazile
--well,
i
think,
yes,
it
is,
your
honor.
mr.
kevin
c.
brazile
well...
well,
your
honor,
justice
breyer,
what
had
occurred
is
they
served
a
subpoena
on
the
witness,
traci
baker.
and
part
of
that
subpoena
required
her
to
produce
the
documents,
not
the
lawyer.
mr.
kevin
c.
brazile
pardon?
mr.
kevin
c.
brazile
well,
they
chose
to
get
a
warrant.
he
was
there.
he
indicated
that
he
had
the
documents.
they
obtained
the
warrant.
if
they
had
waited
any
longer,
possibly
to
get
a
subpoena,
he
could
have
transferred
the
documents
to
someone
else.
mr.
kevin
c.
brazile
exactly.
mr.
kevin
c.
brazile
well,
the
problem
that
the
prosecutors
were
confronted
with...
days
before
the
appearance
of
the
witness
before
the
grand
jury,
the
subpoena,
which
required
the
documents,
had
been
served
on
mr.
gabbert
at
his
office.
he
had
been
in
communication
with
mr.
conn
days
and
a
couple
of
weeks
before
the
incident
occurred.
so,
he
knew
exactly
what
documents
they
were
after,
and
he
never
at
one
time
volunteered,
oh,
by
the
way,
here
they
are;
i'll
give
them
to
you,
you
don't
need
to
subpoena
anyone.
in
their
minds,
the
witness
was
giving
the
documents
to
her
lawyer.
she
was
not
producing
the
documents
as
required
by
the
subpoena.
to
search
mr.
gabbert,
if
the
documents
are
in
fact
in
his
briefcase,
they
wanted
to
get
a
warrant--
mr.
kevin
c.
brazile
--pardon?
mr.
kevin
c.
brazile
the
subpoena
required
the
production
of
the
documents
on
march
21st,
1994,
the
day
of
her
grand
jury
testimony.
mr.
kevin
c.
brazile
she
had
to
produce
it
with...
with
her
at
her
grand
jury
testimony.
mr.
kevin
c.
brazile
correct.
mr.
kevin
c.
brazile
well,
she
hadn't
gone
before
the
grand
jury
at
that
point
in
time.
mr.
kevin
c.
brazile
but
she
had
also
earlier
indicated
that
the
documents
that...
when
her
apartment
was
searched...
i
believe
it
was
on
march
the
18th...
she
told
them
during
that
search
that
all
the
documents
that
you
want,
i've
turned
over
to
my
lawyer.
mr.
kevin
c.
brazile
yes,
mr.
chief
justice
rehnquist,
the
subpoena
was
valid
under
california
law.
there
has
never
been
any
challenge
to
the
warrant...
i
mean
to
the
subpoena.
mr.
kevin
c.
brazile
that's...
that's
correct,
justice
scalia.
mr.
kevin
c.
brazile
and,
essentially,
that's
what
happened.
and--
mr.
kevin
c.
brazile
--to
the
lawyer?
mr.
kevin
c.
brazile
no,
they
did
not.
mr.
kevin
c.
brazile
no.
mr.
kevin
c.
brazile
no,
they
did
not.
mr.
kevin
c.
brazile
there
was
a
discussion
upstairs,
before
they
went
down
to
the
grand
jury
room.
and
mr.
gabbert
indicated
that
he
had
the
documents
and
that
the
documents
were
in
his
briefcase.
at
that--
mr.
kevin
c.
brazile
--mr.
conn
did
not
say
that,
but
mr.
gabbert
knew
full
well
that
the
documents
were
subject
to
a
subpoena,
because
a
subpoena
was
served
on
his
office.
mr.
kevin
c.
brazile
i...
i
don't
believe
so,
your
honor.
no.
mr.
kevin
c.
brazile
justice
kennedy,
that's
correct.
even
if
it
was
timed
in
that
fashion,
there
still
would
not
be
a
substantive
due
process
right
violation
here.
mr.
kevin
c.
brazile
i
don't
concede
that
there
was
a
fourth
amendment
violation
because--
mr.
kevin
c.
brazile
--well,
as
to
the
second
search
that
occurred
after
the
grand
jury
testimony,
that
is
still
an
open
question.
and
that
issue
will
have
to
be
resolved--
mr.
kevin
c.
brazile
--there
were
two
searches,
your
honor.
the--
mr.
kevin
c.
brazile
--that...
that's
correct.
but--
mr.
kevin
c.
brazile
--correct.
and
the
ninth
circuit
has
held
that
that
search
was
a
valid...
that
warrant
was
a
valid
warrant.
so,
there
really
is
no
fourth
amendment
question.
mr.
kevin
c.
brazile
no.
mr.
kevin
c.
brazile
that's
correct--
mr.
kevin
c.
brazile
--justice
ginsburg.
mr.
kevin
c.
brazile
that's
correct.
mr.
kevin
c.
brazile
in
this
case,
i
think
the...
the
way
the
complaint
was
pled,
yes,
they
would
have
to
amend
the
complaint
to
state
such
a
cause
of
action.
but
it
would
be
our
position
that
under
these
facts,
the
execution
of
that
warrant
was
not
unreasonable.
mr.
kevin
c.
brazile
not
as
to
the
first
search.
as...
they
could
amend
the
complaint
as
to
the
second
search.
mr.
kevin
c.
brazile
that's
correct.
mr.
kevin
c.
brazile
that's
correct.
mr.
kevin
c.
brazile
it's...
it's...
justice
ginsburg,
yes,
the
complaint
probably
could
be
amended.
mr.
kevin
c.
brazile
no,
it's
not
before
this
court,
but--
mr.
kevin
c.
brazile
--there
would
be
a
state
law--
mr.
kevin
c.
brazile
--justice
kennedy,
there
would
be
a
cause
of
action
for
abuse
of
process.
there
could
also
be
a
cause
of
action
for
intentional
infliction
of
emotional
distress.
there
could
be
a
cause
of
action
for
breach
of
mandatory
duty
under
california
law.
there's
a
government
code
section...
i
believe
it's
815.6...
that
allows
for
such
a
cause
of
action.
mr.
kevin
c.
brazile
those
cause
of
actions,
no.
mr.
kevin
c.
brazile
yes,
it
could
be.
because
if...
if
we
allow
for
any
and
every
alleged
governmental
tort
to
be
a
14th
amendment
violation,
then
the
14th
amendment
essentially
becomes
a
font
of
tort
law.
that's
why
what
we're
saying
in
our...
our
position
is
that,
in
order
to
have
a
14th
amendment
violation,
you
need
a
complete
ban
or
exclusion
from
the
practice
of
the
profession,
not
this
temporary
delay
or
interruption
in
the
practice
of
the
profession.
which,
in
this
case,
your
honor,
was...
was
a
period
of
less
than
20
minutes.
and
once
this
interruption
was
over,
he
then
continued
to
represent
his
client
at
the
contempt
hearing.
mr.
kevin
c.
brazile
the
cases
from
this
court,
your
honor,
don't...
in
my
opinion,
don't
go
that
far.
and
i
haven't
seen
a
case.
there's
the
case
of
board
of
regents
v.
roth.
there's
also
the
case
of
cafeteria
workers
v.
mcelroy.
those
cases
deal
with
someone
losing
their
job.
but,
by
analogy,
those
cases
would
suggest,
and
it's
our
position,
that
you
have
to
have
a
ban
or
exclusion
or
foreclosure
of
the
employment
in
order
to
state
a
14th
amendment
right.
mr.
kevin
c.
brazile
that's
correct.
and
in
those
situations,
i
think
it's...
the...
the
right
is
even
more
important
or
more
significant,
because
they're
totally
out
of
a
job.
mr.
gabbert
was
not
put
out
of
work.
mr.
gabbert
continued
to
represent
miss
baker
immediately
after
the
search.
mr.
kevin
c.
brazile
he...
he
did.
in
fact,
he
did,
your
honor,
yes.
mr.
kevin
c.
brazile
there...
there's...
you
have
a
right
to
practice
your
chosen
profession...
profession,
justice
ginsburg.
but
that
right
does
not
extend
so
far
that
any
interruption
or
delay
in
your
practice
of
your
profession
states
a
substantive
due
process
14th
amendment
claim.
and...
and
the
crux
of
our
argument
here
is
that
where
you
have
this
temporary
delay
or
interruption
in...
in
the
practice
of
someone's
profession,
that
doesn't
rise
to
the
level
of
a
14th
amendment
claim.
there
are
other
remedies
available.
again,
the
state
tort
remedies,
an
action
for
abuse
of
process,
an
action
for
intentional
infliction
of
emotional
distress,
of
a
negligence
tort.
there
are...
there
are
several
other
remedies.
what
we
don't
want
to
see
is
the
floodgates
opened
here,
that
any
interruption
of
a
profession...
and
this
case
is
not
limited
just
to
lawyers;
this
case
would
apply
to
any
profession,
whether
it
be
an
accountant,
a
secretary,
anyone
who
is
practicing
their
profession--
mr.
kevin
c.
brazile
--well,
any...
any--
mr.
kevin
c.
brazile
--i
think,
under
the
ninth
circuit's
decision
in
this
case,
if
you're
a
plumber
and
we
execute
a--
mr.
kevin
c.
brazile
--a
valid
warrant
on
you
when
you're
fixing
a...
a
pipe
in
someone's
home--
mr.
kevin
c.
brazile
--potentially
you
could
sue
the
government
for
a
14th
amendment
claim,
by
saying,
well,
the
search
interrupted
or
delayed
my
fixing
of
the
pipe,
and
i
couldn't
practice
my
plumbing
profession
to
the
highest
standards.
it
goes
that
far.
it
would
apply
to
any
profession,
not
just
lawyers.
mr.
kevin
c.
brazile
the...
the
client
potentially
had
a
sixth
amendment
cause
of
action.
however,
because
this
was
a
grand
jury
proceeding,
no
formal
charges
had
been
initiated.
it's
questionable
whether
or
not
the
sixth
amendment
would
actually
be
triggered.
this
court
has
opinions
that--
mr.
kevin
c.
brazile
--for...
for...
on
behalf
of--
mr.
kevin
c.
brazile
--yes,
oh,
absolutely,
under
this
court's
decision
in
warth
v.
seldin,
the
court
has
held
that
you
cannot
assert,
under
section
1983,
the
rights
of
a
third
party.
and
that's
essentially
what
the
lawyer
would
be
doing
if
he
was
suing
based
upon
the
client's
sixth
amendment
rights.
and
this
court
has
criticized
that,
and
condemned
that
practice,
in
u.s.
v.
williams,
which
was
a
grand
jury
case
that
the
court
decided
a
few
years
ago.
mr.
kevin
c.
brazile
i
believe
there
were
a
couple
of
pages
of
the
letters,
justice
kennedy,
that
were
provided.
i
believe
that's
correct.
mr.
kevin
c.
brazile
well,
what
they
did
here--
mr.
kevin
c.
brazile
--well,
justice
breyer,
what
they
did
here
is
they
got
a
warrant
not
only
for
mr.
gabbert,
they
also
got
a
warrant
for...
for
traci
baker.
because
the
plan
was...
or
the
idea
was
you
would
search
mr.
gabbert
for
the
documents.
and
then,
if
he
somehow
passed
the
documents
to
someone,
you
could
also
search
miss
baker.
so,
when
you're
looking
for
these
kind
of
documents,
the
appropriate
procedure
is
to
get
a
warrant,
present
an
affidavit
of
probable
cause
to...
to
an
independent
judge,
and
let
him
make
a
determination
whether
or
not
we
can
do
a
search.
the
prosecutors
in
this
case
were
trying
the
best
they
knew
how
to
follow
the
book
here,
by
getting
a
warrant
and...
which...
a
warrant
that's
been
upheld
to
be
a
valid
search
warrant
in
this
case.
mr.
kevin
c.
brazile
he
was
there.
they
didn't
know
for
certain
whether
or
not
he
had
the
documents.
he
indicated
that
he
had
the
documents
in
his
briefcase.
mr.
kevin
c.
brazile
pardon?
mr.
kevin
c.
brazile
no.
during...
during
the
search,
i
don't
believe
they
got
the
two
pages,
justice
ginsburg.
mr.
kevin
c.
brazile
i...
i...
justice
ginsburg,
i
don't
believe
that's
an
accurate
reflection
of
the
record.
it
was
my
recollection
that...
that
the
search
by
the
special
master
didn't
uncover
any
of
the
documents
that
were
being
sought.
mr.
kevin
c.
brazile
i
don't
believe
mr.
gabbert
turned
over
those
documents.
i
believe
that's
what
the
record
will
show.
what
i'd
like
to
do
now
is
to
address
the
issue
of
the
second
question
of
certiorari,
which
is
the
question
of...
of
qualified
immunity.
it's
our
position
that
this
right
that's
being
alleged
here,
this
right
to
practice
the
profession,
really
is
the
right
as
to
whether
or
not
a
lawyer
has
a
right
not
to
be
subject
to
being
searched
at
a
grand
jury
proceeding
when
his
client
is
testifying.
and
based
upon
the
clearly
established
case
law,
there
is
no
such
right
that
was
recognized
under
the
case
law
in
1994.
the
case
law
talks
about--
mr.
kevin
c.
brazile
--that...
that's
correct,
your
honor.
but
this...
what
i
was--
mr.
kevin
c.
brazile
--that...
that's
correct.
mr.
kevin
c.
brazile
yes,
justice.
mr.
kevin
c.
brazile
that's
correct,
your
honor.
i
stand
corrected.
chief
justice
rehnquist,
as
you
indicated,
the
qualified
immunity
issue,
if
the
court
determines
that
there
was
no
egregious
or
conscience
shocking...
conscience
shocking
conduct
in
this
case,
or
that
there
is
no
substantive
due
process
right
involved
here,
we
don't
even
get
to
the...
to
the
qualified
immunity
issue.
and
there's
even
a
suggestion,
i
believe,
in
a
concurring
opinion
by
justice
stevens,
in
the
case
of
county
of
sacramento
v.
lewis,
that
the
court
could
even
go
directly,
first,
to
the
issue
of
qualified
immunity.
here,
when
one
looks
at
the...
the
case
law,
the
question
is,
what
is
the
relevant
case
law?
it's
our
position
that
the
relevant
case
law
for
the
purposes
of
deciding
what
is
or
what
is
not
qualified
immunity
is
a
decision
of
this
court
or
a
decision
of
the
federal
district
courts,
and
not
something
that's
based
purely
upon
a
district
court
opinion.
there's
a
few
circuits...
or,
actually,
many
of
the
circuits...
the
second,
the
fourth,
the
sixth,
the
seventh,
the
10th
and
11th...
that
do
not
allow
district
court
opinions
to
establish
clearly
established
law.
and
what
we're
urging
that
this
court
do
in
this
case
is
to
use
or
adopt
the
bright
line
standard
for
establishing
whether
or
not
there's
been
a
violation
of
clearly
established
law.
in
a
case
of...
of
this
nature
where
you
have
very
unique
circumstances,
you
need
a
high
degree
of
factual
correspondence
or
similarity
from
the
prior
case
law.
no
case
has
been
cited
that
involves
a
situation
such
as
this,
where
you're
involved
with
a
grand
jury,
there's
an
issue
of
where
there's
no...
the
sixth
amendment
right
is
not
in...
in
play.
and
here
also,
you
have
a
valid
warrant.
inherent
in
any
execution
of
the
warrant
is
going
to
be
some
kind
of
delay
or
disruption.
prosecutors
in
this
case,
the
petitioners,
had
no
way
of
knowing
that
the
conduct
they
engaged
in
would
violate
the
14th
amendment
rights
of
mr.
gabbert.
there's
no
case
that
would
have
put
them
on
notice
or
made
it
very
obvious
or
apparent
to
them
that
they
were
in
violation
of
such
a
right.
and
this
right
of
undue
interference,
or
unreasonable
interference,
with
the
right
to
practice
a
profession
is
very
vague
and
abstract.
there
needs
to
be
some
clear-cut
guidelines.
there
are
no
clear-cut
guidelines
under
the
case
law
as
of
1994.
therefore,
the
issue
of
qualified
immunity
should
have
applied
in
this
case,
because
the
law
was
not
clearly
established.
they
were
not
knowingly
in
violation
of
the
law
based
upon
the
facts
and
circumstances
confronting
them.
mr.
kevin
c.
brazile
correct,
justice
kennedy.
if
there
is
a
right
here,
it
would
arise
under
the
fourth
amendment,
not
the
14th.
and...
and
the
qualified
immunity
defense
is...
is
right-specific.
if
they
have--
mr.
kevin
c.
brazile
--it
would
be
our
position...
i
don't
believe
that
the
fourth
amendment
would
give
a
cause
of
action
based
upon
the
state
of
the
case
law.
but
if
there
is
a
possibility...
and
it's
our
position
that
there
is
not
a
fourth
amendment
violation
here,
based
upon
when
the
warrant
was
served...
but
if
there
is
a
possibility
of
a
cognizable
claim
under
the
constitution,
it's
under
the
fourth
amendment
and
not
the
14th
amendment.
and
because
the
issue
of
qualified
immunity
is
right-specific,
that
insofar
as
there
are
14th
amendment
claim
concerns
here,
that
the
qualified
immunity
defense
should
apply
and
preclude
a
14th
amendment
claim
in
this
particular
action.
mr.
kevin
c.
brazile
the
district
attorney's
office
does
have
a
manual
that
governs
grand
jury
proceedings.
but
i
don't
believe
it's
specific
as
to
the
situation
that
arose
here.
and
i
can't
think
of
any
ethical
rules
that
would
have
governed
this
situation
that
they
were
faced
with.
because
these
were
some
rather
unique
circumstances
that
they
were
confronted
with.
so,
i
think
the
remedy,
if
there
is
one,
is
through
the
state
tort
law.
and
i
think,
clearly,
as
i
indicated
earlier,
justice
ginsburg,
the
tort
of
abuse
of
process
is
what
would
remedy
a
situation
like
this,
where
they're
alleging
that
we
used
the
warrant
in
a
deliberate
fashion
to
somehow
deprive
someone
of...
of
a
right
or
to
harm
a
particular
person.
so...
but
it's
not
the
14th.
that's
not
the
vehicle.
because
we
don't
want
to
have
the
14th
amendment
as
a
vehicle
or
a
mode
for
setting
rules
that
are
going
to
govern
criminal
procedure
or
rules
that...
or
we
don't
want
the
14th
amendment
to
somehow
supervise
how
the
grand
jury
proceedings
are
run.
leave
that
to
the
states.
and
if
there's
a
harm
that's
caused,
let
the
state
tort
remedy
be
involved.
this
is
not
the
kind
of
egregious,
outrageous
conduct
that's
shocking
of
the
conscience.
