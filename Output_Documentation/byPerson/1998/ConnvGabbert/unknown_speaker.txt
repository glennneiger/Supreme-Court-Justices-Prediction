mr.
brazile,
if
you...
you
say
the
conduct
wasn't
egregious
enough
to
meet
what
you
say
is
the
standard.
but
do
you
concede
that
it...
it
was
subject
to
some
kind
of
sanction
at
all,
to
deliberately
time
the
search...
the
search
with
a
warrant...
of
the
lawyer
at
the
very
moment
when
his
client
was
being...
was
testifying?
unknown
speaker
but
apart
from
what...
your...
your
argument
about
constitutional
violation
is
my
question
to
you
was,
is
there
any
sanction
for
this?
if
the
warrant
could
have
been...
it
could
have
been
executed
before
the
witness
appeared
before
the
grand
jury
or
after,
but
it
wasn't
a
coincidence
that
they
occurred
simultaneously.
and
my
question
to
you,
just...
is...
is
whether
there
is
any
sanction
for
this?
or
if
it
doesn't
meet
the
constitutional
standard,
that's
it?
unknown
speaker
is
it
correct
that
the
service
was
not
coincidental,
the
time
of
the
service?
i
mean,
do
you
acknowledge
that?
unknown
speaker
that
it
was
calculated
to--
unknown
speaker
--well,
how
does
this...
i
don't...
i'm
just
not
familiar
with
this
procedure.
i
mean,
i
would
have
thought
that
a
client
has
an
instrument
of
a
crime,
gives
it
to
her
lawyer.
the
government,
i
take
it,
has
a
right
to
it.
i've
just
never
heard
of...
if
the
lawyer,
who
is
an
officer
of
the
court,
has
an
instrument
of
the
crime
that
the
government
has
a
right
to,
why
wouldn't
the
government
just
ask
him
for
it,
or
subpoena
it?
i
mean,
i've
never
heard
of
a
search
warrant
for...
for...
is
this
a
normal
procedure?
i...
i
don't
understand.
unknown
speaker
justice
breyer
hasn't
practiced
in
california.
[laughter]
well,
i
haven't
either,
but
it
is
a
rather
unusual
practice
out
there,
i
guess.
unknown
speaker
is
this
typical
out
there?
unknown
speaker
is
this
the
way
you
normally
get
documents
from
lawyers?
unknown
speaker
so,
that's
the
normal
way
you
get
documents
from
lawyers
out
in
your...
your
esteemed
bar,
you
serve...
you
serve
warrants--
unknown
speaker
--rather
than
call
them
up
and
ask
them
or
serve
a
subpoena?
is
this
typical?
i
mean--
unknown
speaker
--wow.
my
brother
is
out
in
california.
it's
a
jungle
out
there.
my
family
has
lawyers
out
in
california
and
never
heard
of
this.
[laughter]
what?
this
is
a
normal
thing;
they
don't
just
ask
the
lawyer,
please,
give
me
the
document?
if
the
lawyer
is
uncertain
about
it,
they
need
protection
legally,
and
say,
bring...
get
a
subpoena,
or--
unknown
speaker
--so,
why
didn't
they
have
a
subpoena
for
the
lawyer?
unknown
speaker
why
didn't
they
have
a
subpoena
for
the
lawyer?
if
he
wants
that
protection,
i
would
have
thought
that
the
lawyer
would
just
say,
here
it
is,
if
it's
undisputed.
and
if
it
is
disputed,
why
wouldn't
they
get
a
subpoena
or
some
other
court
procedure?
unknown
speaker
but
he's
an
officer
of
the
court.
unknown
speaker
i
would
assume
that
he
would
not
take
a...
a...
is
there
some
reason
not
to
go
on
the
normal
presumption
that
people
try
to
follow
the
law,
who
are
lawyers?
unknown
speaker
when
did
the
subpoena
require
the
production
of
the
documents?
unknown
speaker
the
subpoena
required
the
production
of
the
document
where
and
when?
unknown
speaker
well,
she
didn't
have
a
duty
to
produce
it
before
she
showed
up
before
the
grand
jury,
did
she?
unknown
speaker
at
the
time
of
her
testimony?
unknown
speaker
so,
at
the
time
you
served
the...
the
search
warrant,
she
was
not
in
default
on
the
subpoena,
was
she?
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
and
i
presume--
--but
there's...
there's
no
doubt,
i
take
it,
that
the
subpoena
was
valid
under
california
law?
unknown
speaker
and
i
assume
that
the
reason
it
was
served
that
morning
was
that
she
said
she
wasn't
bringing
the
documents
with
her,
because
her
lawyer
had
them,
and
that
they
wanted
the
documents
in
order
to
examine
her
before
the
grand
jury
when
she
appeared?
unknown
speaker
so,
if
you
didn't
get
the
doc...
the
documents
from
the
lawyer,
and
she
showed
up
without
them,
she'd
have
to
go
ahead
with
her
grand
jury
testimony
without
the
documents
to
cross-examine
her
with?
unknown
speaker
well,
did
you...
when...
when
your
client
got
to
that
point,
did...
did
your
client
say
to
the...
to
the
lawyer,
we...
we
are
told
that
you
have
the
documents
subject
to
the
subpoena;
will
you
give
them
to
us
or
do
we
have
to
subpoena
you
or
get
a
search
warrant;
did
they
say
that?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
did
they
say,
please
give
them
to
us?
unknown
speaker
they
didn't
do
that?
unknown
speaker
why
didn't
they
do
that?
unknown
speaker
but
nobody
said,
may
we
have
them;
they're
subject
to
subpoena?
unknown
speaker
no,
i'm
sure
he
did.
i
just
wanted
to
know
whether
anybody
asked
for
them.
unknown
speaker
nobody
did.
but
this
case
comes
to
us
on
summary
judgment.
i
take
it
you
can
argue
the
case...
that
you
do
argue
the
case
on
the
assumption
that
it
might
be
proved
that
this
warrant
was
timed
so
as
to
deliberately
interfere
with
the
representation
of
the
client
before
the
grand
jury.
and
you
say
that
even
if
that
is
so,
there
is
no
substantive
due
process
violation.
is...
is
that
your
position?
unknown
speaker
do
you
concede
that
there
may
well
be
a
fourth
amendment
violation...
that's
not
before
us;
and
i
take
it
that
will
be
inquired
into
on
remand
to
the
district
court...
but
do
you
concede,
for
the
sake
of
argument,
that
there
may
be
a
fourth
amendment
violation?
unknown
speaker
but
there
may
be,
that
that's
an
open
question?
unknown
speaker
i'm
sorry,
you...
you've
got
the
better
of
me.
the
second
search?
unknown
speaker
i
thought
we
were
talking
about
the
search
that
was
going
on
during
the
grand
jury
testimony.
unknown
speaker
that...
i
thought
that
was...
that...
that
was
the
search
which
he
says
interfered
with
his
right
to
represent
his
client.
unknown
speaker
well,
it
may
be
a
valid
warrant,
but
an
unreasonable
search.
is...
is
the
question
of
the
reasonableness
of
that
search
still
an
open
question?
unknown
speaker
okay.
and--
--because
that
was
put
under
the
fifth
amendment.
the
other
part
of
the
case
that
is
still
alive
in
the
district
court,
as
i
understand
it,
was
put
under
the
fourth
amendment,
because
there
was
no
warrant
for
the
second
search.
unknown
speaker
i
see.
unknown
speaker
and
in...
in...
in
that
light,
since
there
is
this
piece
of
the
case
that
unquestionably
remains
alive--
unknown
speaker
--the
second,
unwarranted
search,
why
wouldn't
it
be
open
to
the
plaintiff
to
amend
the
complaint
to
assert
that
the
first
search
violated
the
fourth
amendment,
because,
although
there
was
a
warrant,
it
was...
the
timing
of
it
was
unreasonable?
unknown
speaker
but
it
would
still
be
as...
there's
nothing
that
is
before
us
now
that
would
foreclose
the
plaintiff
from,
in
the
district
court,
moving
to
amend
the
complaint
to
add
to
the
fourth
amendment
claim
that's
already
there,
this
further
fourth
amendment
claim?
unknown
speaker
no.
the
second
search
is
not
before
us,
as
i
understand
it.
unknown
speaker
that's
in
the
district
court.
unknown
speaker
you
have
made
an
argument
that
this
is
not
a
violation
of
the
fifth
amendment
due
process
clause.
my
question
to
you
is,
it
was
never
asserted
that
it's
a
violation
of
the
fourth
amendment.
but
one
of
the
amici...
amici
briefs
made
that
suggestion,
that
if
there's
anything
wrong
here,
it
has
to
do
with
the
fourth
amendment,
not
the
fifth
amendment.
so,
could
the
complaint
be
amended
to
so
assert?
unknown
speaker
well,
that
issue
isn't
before
this
court
at
all,
is
it?
unknown
speaker
getting
to
the
issue
that...
that
is
before
this
court.
assuming
the
warrant
was
issued
and...
and
was
executed
in
a
way
deliberately
to
interfere
with
the
representation
of
the
client,
is...
is
the
only
state
law
cause
of
action
to...
to
remedy
that,
an
abuse
of
process?
unknown
speaker
or
there's
some
other
remedies?
unknown
speaker
does
the
existence
of
those
cause
of
actions
bear
on
the
question
of
whether
there
is
a
federal
substantive
due
process
right?
unknown
speaker
that...
that
is
to
say,
if
there
is
adequate
remedies
under
the
state...
an
adequate
remedy
under
state
law,
is
that
a
ground
for
saying
that
there
is
no
substantive
due
process
right
under
the
14th
amendment?
unknown
speaker
well,
is
there
any
case
from
our
court
that
says
there's
a
substantive
due
process
right
to
practice
law?
unknown
speaker
and
roth
and
cafeteria
workers
also
were
an
employer-employee
situation,
were
they
not?
unknown
speaker
and
he
represented
her
during
the
search.
unknown
speaker
but
is
there
a
right
to
practice
law,
to
get
a
license,
if
you
qualify,
a
right
that
the
state
cannot
arbitrarily
deny
you?
there
is
such
a
right,
is
there
not?
unknown
speaker
a
secretary
is
not
a
profession.
is
it
only
professions
it's
limited
to?
i
mean--
unknown
speaker
--what
if
i'm
a
plumber
and
the
government
unreasonably
interferes
with
my--
unknown
speaker
--right.
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
if
there
had
been
a
real
interference
with
representation
before
the
grand
jury,
i
take
it
the
client
would
have
had
a
sixth
amendment
cause
of
action...
the
client?
unknown
speaker
is
there
any...
is
there
any
indication
that
that
wrong
could...
could
be
alleged
by
the
attorney?
unknown
speaker
there's
a...
well,
there's
a
standing
problem,
isn't
there?
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask,
just
because
i'm
curious,
did
you
ever
get
the
document?
[laughter]
justice
stevens,
i...
i
believe,
later,
there
was
a
search
of
mr.
gabbert's
office,
i
believe
that
same
day.
and,
quite
frankly,
i
don't
recall
if
we
got
the
actual
documents
we
were
looking
for.
there
was
the...
the
first
letter,
which
essentially
was
a
script
for
her
testimony,
when
she
testified
at
the
first
trial.
but
i
don't
believe
we
got
any
other
documents.
well,
the
two
pages
that
were...
there
was
two
pages
of
the...
there
were
two
pages
of
the
letter
that
were
delivered
at...
at
the
search.
was
that
not
true?
didn't...
didn't
he
give
two
pages
of
the
letter?
unknown
speaker
is
this...
is
this...
i'm
still...
i
know
this
isn't
directly
on
the
point,
but
i'm
somewhat
concerned
about
going
into
the
lawyer's
office,
searching
the
office,
as
if
that's
a
normal
procedure.
what
is
the
normal
procedure?
wouldn't
you
ask
the
witness
for
the
letter?
you
subpoenaed
the
letter.
you...
you
subpoenaed
the
letter.
she
says,
i
don't
have
it;
i
won't
give
it
to
you.
now,
if
she's
given
it
to
her
lawyer,
can't
she
ask
it
back.
wouldn't
you
hold
her
in
contempt?
if
a
state's
entitled
to
it--
unknown
speaker
--wouldn't
the
judge
say,
put
her
in
prison
until
she
gives
him
the
letter?
and
if
he's
not
entitled
to
it,
she
shouldn't...
they
shouldn't
have
it.
i
mean,
what's
the
normal
procedure?
unknown
speaker
but
the
one
thing
they
couldn't
do,
based
on
the
time
they
executed
this,
was
to
have
that
document
when
she
appeared
in
the
grand
jury
room,
because
the
document,
she
said,
was
with
her
lawyer.
her
lawyer
was
in
another
room
being
searched.
so,
if
the
purpose
was
to
get
her
in
the
grand
jury
room
with
the
letter,
then...
then
why
didn't
they
wait...
what
did
you
say,
the
whole
thing
took
20
minutes...
wait
to
start
her
testimony
for
20
minutes?
unknown
speaker
i
thought
he
took
the
two
pages
out
first
thing.
unknown
speaker
i
thought
the
two
pages
were
turned
over
by
the
lawyer
himself,
not...
they
were
not
the
result
of...
of
searching
his
briefcase.
unknown
speaker
well,
then
maybe
my
memory
is...
is
faulty.
i
thought
that...
that
the
master
turned
up
nothing,
but
the
lawyer
himself
had
produced,
once
the
search
started,
the
two
pages.
unknown
speaker
yes.
but...
but
what
is
your
recollection
about
when
those
two
pages
were
turned
over,
and
in
what
manner?
unknown
speaker
you've
been
arguing
up
to
now
that
there's
no
such
right
as
of
the
case
law
right
now,
have
you
not?
unknown
speaker
afore
certiorari,
then?
unknown
speaker
mr.
brazile,
may
i
just
interrupt
you
to
read
from
the
ninth
circuit's
decision?
unknown
speaker
it
says:
at
gabbert's
request,
the
search
took
place
in
a
private
room.
before
he
was
actually
searched,
gabbert
gave
oppenheim,
who
was
the
special
master,
two
photocopied
pages
of
a
three-page
letter
from
lyle
menendez
to
baker.
so,
i
think
that
my
recollection
was
correct
in
that
respect,
that
the
lawyer
voluntarily,
at
the
very
beginning
of
the
search
which
turned
up
nothing,
turned
over
two
pages
of
a
three-page
letter.
unknown
speaker
is
it
your
position
that
if
there
is...
going
back
to
this
substantive
question
of
whether
or
not...
if
there
is
a
right,
it's
under
the
fourth
amendment?
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
there
is
a
right
not
to
have
a
warrant
that's
timed
so
as
to
unreasonably
interfere
with
your
occupation?
unknown
speaker
mr.
brazile,
you
mentioned
possible
state
tort
remedies.
is
there
anything...
is
there
any
kind
of
ethical
guide
for
district
attorneys
that...
that
would
address
how
you
deal
with
witnesses
and
lawyers
in...
in
the
grand
jury
setting?
unknown
speaker
thank
you,
mr.
brazile.
mr.
lightfoot,
we'll
hear
from
you.
unknown
speaker
am
i
right
in
thinking
that
mr.
gabbert
was
available
every
time
she
wanted
to
consult
while
she
was
in
the
grand
jury
room?
unknown
speaker
and
did
the...
did
the
case
get
any
more
developed
than
just
on
the
basis
of
a
complaint
and
answer?
were
there
any
depositions
or
affidavits
or
summary
judgment
proceedings?
unknown
speaker
well,
you
just
said
something,
"he
was
taken".
didn't
he
ask
to
have
the
search
done
in
a
private
room?
unknown
speaker
but
every
time
she
asked
if
she
could
go
to
that
room,
she
was
told,
yes,
you
can.
unknown
speaker
why
couldn't
he
have
just
said,
client,
tell
them
to
wait,
instead
of
giving
his...
giving...
if
he
had
said
that,
then
maybe
all
of
this
could
have
been
avoided.
unknown
speaker
well,
he
wasn't.
why
couldn't
he
just
have
said,
can
you
interrupt
the
search
for
a
moment
while
i
talk
to
my
client?
unknown
speaker
could
he...
did
he
ask
to
do
that?
did
he
ask
to
have
the
search
stopped?
incidentally,
how
long
did
this
search
take,
for
pete's
sake?
i
mean,
it...
it...
the
way
it's
described,
"i
am
in
the
process
of
being
searched.
"
i
mean,
what
did
it
take,
20
minutes?
unknown
speaker
who
did
nothing
with
them.
i
mean,
nothing...
none
of
that
was
turned
over
to
the
prosecutor.
unknown
speaker
may...
may
i
interrupt
you
just
to
ask
this
question?
unknown
speaker
you
said
that
under
the
california
statute
that
governs
this,
once
he
invoked
the
privilege,
the
search
should
have
stopped.
and
you
say
it
did
not.
does
he
have
a
cause
of
action
under
the
california
statute?
unknown
speaker
well,
could
we--
--so,
are
you
taking...
i'm
sorry.
i'm
sorry.
are
you
taking
that
question
up?
did
you
raise
that
before
the
circuit?
unknown
speaker
okay.
now,
may
i...
one
related
question.
i
take
it,
based
on
the
representations
of...
of
counsel
on
the
other
side,
that
you
did
not,
or
have
not,
raised
a
claim
that
this
search,
under
the
warrant,
was
an
unreasonable
search
within
the
meaning
of
the
fourth
amendment;
is
that
correct?
unknown
speaker
is
there
any
reason
that
you
could
not
raise
that
claim?
unknown
speaker
well,
you're...
you're
saying
you
want
us
to
see
it
as
a
14th
amendment
problem,
but
my
question
is,
why
shouldn't
you
raise
it
as
a
fourth
amendment
problem?
we
have
said
a
number
of
times
that
if
a
claim
for
relief
can
be
raised
under
a
specific
constitutional
guarantee,
that's
the
guarantee
to
invoke,
and
not
the
broad
generality
of
substantive
due
process
under
the
14th
amendment.
so,
i...
i...
i
think
you
have
a
burden
to
indicate
why
you
have
not
raised
the
timing
of
the
search
as
an
issue
of
reasonableness
under
the
fourth
amendment.
unknown
speaker
well,
the
textual
source
here
is
the
reasonableness
requirement
of
the
14th...
of
the
fourth
amendment.
and
is...
is
there
some
reason
that
you
cannot
raise
this
issue...
it
may,
you
know,
be
a...
a
new
issue...
but
is
there
some
reason
you
can't
raise
the
issue
there?
it's
a
new
issue
under
the...
under
the
14th
amendment,
too.
so,
why
not
raise
it
under
the
fourth?
unknown
speaker
it
has
the
manner...
it
has
to
do
with
the
manner
in
which
the
search
was
conducted.
your
claim,
as
i
understand
it,
is
that
the
search
was
conducted
deliberately
in
a
way
to
interfere
with
the
right
of
your
client
to...
the
right
of
your
client
to
advise
his
client
when
called
to
testify
before
a
grand
jury.
why
is
that
not,
at
least
on
the
face
of
it,
an
issue
of
reasonableness
that
could
be
raised
under
the
fourth
amendment?
unknown
speaker
in
any
case,
you
don't
want
to...
you
don't
want
to
pursue
that
avenue
of
relief?
unknown
speaker
the
second...
yeah--
unknown
speaker
--my
questions
are
much
the
same.
i
want
to
know
exactly
what
your
claim
is
in
its
narrowest
sense.
is
it
a
substantive
due
process
violation
that
you
allege?
unknown
speaker
and
what
holding
of
this
court
do
you
think
comes
closest
to
supporting
recognition
of
a
substantive
due
process
violation
here?
unknown
speaker
well,
that's
not
teaching
german
in
a
school.
that
seems
a
rather
far
cry.
unknown
speaker
well,
what...
what
case
supports
that
proposition?
unknown
speaker
well,
those
cases
were
all
overruled
in
the
thirties
and
forties.
unknown
speaker
well,
if
that
is
the
case
you
relied
on,
surely
you
lose
on
the
qualified
immunity
ground.
because
it's...
it's
a
great
leap,
wouldn't
you
agree,
from
that
to
supporting
your
present
claim?
unknown
speaker
well,
but
now,
wait
a
minute.
do
you...
do
you
say
that
an
attorney
cannot
be
searched,
pursuant
to
a
valid
warrant?
unknown
speaker
and
that's
what
happened
here.
there
was
a
valid
warrant;
you
concede
that?
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
well,
of
course
there
was
a
reason;
they
wanted
to
get
a
letter
to
use
to
examine
the
client,
the
lawyer's
client,
about
her
communications
with
the
menendez
defendants.
unknown
speaker
isn't
that
what
happened,
though,
mr.
lightfoot?
you...
you
said
that
this
was
a
device
to
get
that
witness
to
talk
despite
her
fifth
amendment
privilege.
but
as
i
understand
what
went
on,
she
never
did.
she
just...
she
said,
can
i
talk
to
my
lawyer,
and
when
it
didn't
work
out,
she
came
back
and
read
from
her
card,
her
fifth
amendment
rights.
and
she
did
that
twice.
unknown
speaker
but
she
didn't...
she
didn't
give
any
testimony?
unknown
speaker
well,
what
would
he
have
told
her
different
from
"read
the
card
i
gave
you?
"
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
we
know
now
what
the
questions
were.
and
it
seems
that
she
did
precisely
what
he
would
have
counseled
her
to
do.
unknown
speaker
maybe...
go
ahead,
answer
that,
please,
sir.
unknown
speaker
did
she...
have
we
said
there's
a
right
to
have
counsel
in
grand
juries?
no.
a
constitutional
right?
unknown
speaker
that's
new
to
me.
unknown
speaker
constitutional
right,
did
we
say?
unknown
speaker
either
it
is
or
it
isn't.
and
what
is
bothering
me,
i
guess,
like
perhaps
others,
is
it's
you're
not
even
close.
either
she
does
have
the
right
or
she
doesn't.
if
in
fact
she
does,
then
maybe
her
sixth
amendment
right
was
violated.
and
if
she
doesn't,
no
right
was
violated.
he's
entitled
not
to
be
searched
unreasonably.
either
you
had
an
unreasonable
search
or
you
didn't.
if
you
did,
then
in
fact
the
fourth
amendment
is
violated.
if
you
didn't,
nothing
is
violated.
either
way,
no
matter
how
you
parse
it,
there's
no
14th
amendment
right
of
due
process
substantive
at
issue
in
this
case.
this
case
is
about
reasonable
searches
and
seizures.
this
case
is
about
right
to
a
lawyer
before
a
grand
jury.
that's
the
end
of
it.
there's
nothing
else.
all
right.
what's
your
response
to
that?
unknown
speaker
even
if...
mr.
lightfoot,
even
if
we
took
your
best
argument,
didn't
your
client
have
some
kind
of
obligation
to
mitig...
something
akin
to
mitigation
of
damages,
both
for
himself
and
for
the
client?
and
as
has
been
suggested
before,
he
could
have
said,
when
he
knew
his
client
was
looking
for
him,
please
tell
her,
or,
please,
on
my
behalf,
ask
them
to
hold
up
until
this
search
is
finished.
i
mean,
he...
he
had
a
couple
of
opportunities,
and
he
didn't...
didn't
do
anything
to
lessen
whatever
the
trauma
might
have
been
for
his
client.
unknown
speaker
could
not
he
not
have
said...
you
said
this
was
a
representative
of
the
d.a....
would
you
please
tell
your
boss
to
hold
up
until
this
search
is
completed?
he
didn't
say
that.
he
just
said,
they're
going
to
have
to
wait,
as
though
they
would...
they
would
execute
his
non-request
just
because
he
said
that.
unknown
speaker
mr.
lightfoot,
let
me
ask
you
a
question
which
i
think
is
basically
justice
breyer's
question.
but
let
me
go
about
it
in
a
slightly
different
way.
we
have
said
that
we
are
not
going
to
engage
in...
in
recognition
of
a
proliferation
of
due...
substantive
due
process
rights
if
there
is
relief
available
under
more
specific
guarantees
of
the
constitution.
there
are
at
least
two
possible
ways
of
approaching
this
case.
one
of
them
you
have
done,
you
have
followed,
by
saying:
i
claim
the
due
process
right.
another
way
of
approaching
it,
in
which
there's
no
standing
problem
at
least,
is
by
claiming
that
there
was
a
violation
of
the
fourth
amendment
because
the
timing
of
the
search
and
the
reasons
for...
for
that
timing
amount...
make
it...
make
it
an
unreasonable
search.
if...
if
ultimately
this
court
would
not
recognize
the
unreasonability...
the
unreasonableness,
rather...
of
the
search
under
the
fourth
amendment,
what
good
reason
would
there
be
for
us
to
recognize
a
substantive
due
process
right
to
redress
the
same
claim?
unknown
speaker
but
you
recognize...
you've
already
conceded,
and
quite
rightly,
that
there's
no
per
se
rule
against
searching
lawyers.
and,
therefore,
it
would
seem
to
me
that
the
simplest
way
to
approach
the
case
would
be
by
asking,
is
there
something
in
particular
about
this
search
of
the
lawyer
that
somehow
allows
for
relief,
despite
the
fact
that
lawyers
themselves
are
open
to
fourth
amendment
searches,
in...
in
much
the
way
that
other
people
are?
that's
a
simple
way
of
going
about
the
case.
why
don't
we
go
about
it
in
the
simple
way.
and
if
we
don't
find
a
simple
reason
for
recognizing
the
right,
why
go
to
a
more
complicated
level?
unknown
speaker
my
understanding
is
that
there
is
no
constitutional
right
to
a
lawyer
before
a
grand
jury.
so
that
the
argument
you're
now
making
is
just
totally
wrong.
unknown
speaker
you
also
said
earlier
in
your
argument
that...
that
she
refused
to...
she
had
a
right
not
to
turn...
a
fifth
amendment
right
not
to
turn
over
the
documents.
unknown
speaker
what
is
that?
you
have
a
right
not
to
turn
over
a
document
that
would
incriminate
you?
unknown
speaker
my,
it's
wondrous
things
happen
to
the...
to
the
bill
of
rights
out
there
in
california
apparently.
[laughter]
there...
there
is
a
fifth
amendment
right
not
to
turn
over
evidence
which
you
have
if...
if
the
evidence
would
incriminate
you?
unknown
speaker
how...
how
long
was
she
before
the
grand
jury?
does
that
appear
from
the
record?
unknown
speaker
the
20
minutes
includes
the
time
she
was
outside,
or
was
she--
unknown
speaker
--there's
nothing
here
that
shows
that,
on
the
two
occasions
when
she
left
and
came
back,
that
the
prosecutors
inside
the
grand
jury
room
knew
that
she
hadn't
been
able
to
find
her
lawyer.
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
she
went
out
in
search
of
her
lawyer.
unknown
speaker
she
said,
can
i
see
my
lawyer?
they
said,
yes.
she
went
out
to
look
for
her
lawyer.
she
came
back.
they
knew
that
she
went
out
to
look
for
her
lawyer.
did
they
know,
when
she
came
back
into
the
room,
that
she
hadn't
found
him?
unknown
speaker
well,
would
he
report...
under
california
law,
would
the
special
master
report
to
the
grand
jury?
unknown
speaker
that's
who
the
special
master
reports
to
under
that
california
law?
unknown
speaker
and
that...
that
was
all
as
contemplated
by
california
law?
unknown
speaker
in
this
case,
you're
relying
on
meyer?
unknown
speaker
in
this
case,
as
i
understand
it,
you're
relying
on
meyer
and
nebraska?
unknown
speaker
the
schware
didn't
hold
that
there
was
a
substantive
due
process
right
to
practice
law.
unknown
speaker
but
wasn't
that
given
to
him
by
the
state
of
new
mexico?
unknown
speaker
but
the...
the
right,
in
any
case,
was...
was
a
right,
as
it
were,
in
gross.
in
other
words,
a
right
to
choose
a
profession
and,
generally,
to
practice
it.
schware
did
not
deal,
as
i
understand
it,
with
specific
interferences
on
a
sort
of
a
client-based
or
case-based
rationale.
unknown
speaker
but
this
is
much...
i
mean,
this
is
a
tiny
slice.
if
you...
if
you
think
of
the
right
to
practice
law.
we'll
take
the
griffith
case.
i
have
a
right
to
practice
law
if
i'm
qualified,
even
if
i'm
not
a
citizen.
that
general
right.
and
then,
to
take
20
minutes
out
of
lawyer's
life
and
say
that
that
involves
the
right
to
practice
law,
it's
rather
overblown,
it
seems
to
me.
unknown
speaker
go
ahead.
