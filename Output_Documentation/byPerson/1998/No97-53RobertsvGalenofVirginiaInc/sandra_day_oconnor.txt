mr.
mattingly,
do
you
contend
that
this
statute,
this
emergency
medical
care
statute,
incorporates
some
kind
of
substantive
standard
of
medical
care?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
it
says...
it
doesn't
really
talk
about
deterioration.
it
says
that
the
hospital
can't
transfer
until
there's
been...
until
the
condition
has
been
stabilized.
is
that
it?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
now,
in...
in...
in
this
situation,
if
ms.
johnson
had
been
stabilized
at
the
time
she
was
initially
admitted
to
the
emergency
room,
could
she
then
have
been
transferred?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
mean,
is...
doesn't
this
statute
really
focus
on
what
happens
in
the
emergency
room
and
the
stabilization
there?
could
she
at
that
point
have
been
admitted
to
general
admission
in
the
hospital
or
sent
elsewhere?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
no.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
just
wondered
what
your
view
of
it
was
because
on
the
surface
it
would
appear
that
this
statute
just
addresses
itself
to
emergency
room
care.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
presumably
this
argument
would
be
open
in
any
event
on
remand
if...
if
we
agree
with
you
that
there's
no
improper
motive
requirement.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
know
that
this
doesn't
enter
into
our
decision
at
all,
but
where
is
ms.
johnson
today?
is
she
still
hospitalized?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
now,
the
theories,
though,
that
you
do
put
forward
were
not
ones
that
were
aired
in
the
court
below
i
take
it.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
that
makes
it
awfully
hard
for
us
to
deal
with
because
they
aren't
even
well
briefed
here
i
think.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
maybe
one
side.
[laughter]
but
certainly
not
the
other.
we
just
have
to...
by
that
i
mean
the
petitioner
certainly
didn't
address
it
in
the
first
instance,
and
you
brought
something
up.
but
then
they
have
a
reply
brief
and
that's
about
all.
and
the
lower
court
didn't
address
them.
so,
it
makes
it
awfully
hard
for
this
court
to
deal
with.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
let
me
ask
you
how
you
read
subsection
(b)
as
opposed
to
(a)
of
section
1395.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i'm
looking
at
42
u.s.
code,
section
1395d(b),
which
is
examination
and
treatment
for
emergency
medical
conditions
and
women
in
labor.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
subsection
(a)
refers
to
a
medical
screening
requirement
in
the
case
of
a
hospital
that
has
an
emergency
department.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
(b)
says
in
general
if
any
individual
comes
to
a
hospital
and
the
hospital
determines
the
individual
has
an
emergency
medical
condition,
the
hospital
must
do
blah,
blah,
blah.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
now,
does
that
kick
in
in
the
situation
of
a
patient
who's
already
in
the
hospital
and
develops
an
emergency
condition?
what
is
(b)
for?
or
is
it
addressed
to
hospitals
that
don't
have
emergency
departments?
how
do
you
read
this?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
the
statute
doesn't
apply
at
all.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
that
may
not
be
the
focus
of
congress'
intent
in
this
act.
it
may
well
have
been
enacted
to
focus
at
the
front
end
of
the
emergency,
the
woman
in
labor
who's
turned
away--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--that
sort
of
thing.
that's
the
indication
anyway.
