jane

of

mr.

section
what?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
8?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
(a)?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
mattingly.
mr.
feldman,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
when
you
say
raised
for
the
first
time
in
respondent's
brief
on
the
merits,
mr.
feldman,
you
mean
they
were
not
raised
in
the
lower
courts
or
that
they
were...
that
was
the
first
time
they
were
raised
in
this
court?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you're
referring
to
section
(b).
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
the
case
that
the
court
of
appeals
relied
on
came
up
under
section
(a),
did
it
not?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
there's
no
requirement
in
subsection
(b)
that
there
be
an
appropriate
medical
screening.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what
was
the
basis
of
congress'
legislative
jurisdiction
here...
legislative
authority?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so...
so,
it
isn't...
it
doesn't
apply
to
a
hospital
just
by
virtue
of
the
fact
that
the
hospital
might
be
dealing
in
interstate
commerce.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
feldman.
mr.
phillips,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i...
i
thought
hospitals
just
didn't
provide
2
and
a
half
months
of
treatment
anymore,
that
the
idea
was
a
hospital
was
a
place
where
you
went
for,
you
know,
some
sort
of
serious
surgery,
and
you
know,
they
got
you
out
of
there
in
about
3
days.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
phillips.
mr.
mattingly,
you
have
5
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
congress
would
have
said
determines
or
should
have
determined,
wouldn't
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes.
what
you're
saying
is
should
have...
is
congress
meant
should
have
determined
as
well
as
determined.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
would
that
fit
under
determine?
i
mean,
determine
sounds
like
a
decision
made
by
the
person
to
whom
the
verb
is
directed.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
mattingly.
the
case
is
submitted.
