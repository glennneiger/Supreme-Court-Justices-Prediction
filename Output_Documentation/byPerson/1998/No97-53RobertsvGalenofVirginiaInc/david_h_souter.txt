justice
david
h.
souter
is
it
a
cert
worthy
question
of
law
at
this
point?
i
mean,
is
there...
is
there
a
split
on...
on
the...
the
issue
that
you've
raised?
justice
david
h.
souter
can
you...
can
you
maybe
try
it
once?
can
you...
can
you
give
me
an
example?
suppose
the
woman
has
been
in
a
serious
accident,
near
death,
and
she's
in
the
hospital,
admitted,
and
each
day
the
doctors
look
at
her
and
examine
her
and
treat
her
for
3
or
4
months.
and
each
day
they
say,
could
we
move
her
to
a
different
hospital,
and
each
day
the
doctors
say,
i
think
she's
in
too
bad
condition
to
trust
taking
her
in
the
car
over
to
the
other
hospital.
now,
in
that
situation,
imagine
that
situation
and
then
suppose,
you
know,
after
4
months
somebody
transfers
her
anyway
and
she's
hurt.
has
the
statute
been
violated?
justice
david
h.
souter
all
right.
now,
what
are
the
words
in
the
statute
that
have
to
be
interpreted
so
there
would
be
no
violation
in
that
instance
because
it
sounds,
reading
it,
as
if
she's
never
been
stabilized
in...
as
the
way
the
statute
defines
it.
justice
david
h.
souter
what
it
does
say
is
that
stabilized
means
that
no
material
deterioration
of
the
condition
is
likely
to
result
from
or
during
the
transfer.
and
so,
each
day
we've
had
a
doctor
there
saying
that
there
is
some
risk
that
the
transfer
will
hurt
the
woman,
and...
and
therefore
that
definition
wouldn't
seem
to
have
been
satisfied.
and
that
could,
i
guess
in
principle,
extend
for
years.
but...
but
if
it
does
extend
for
years,
isn't
it
true
that
each
day
that
definition
of
stabilize
was
not
satisfied
and
therefore
the
hospital
cannot
transfer
the
woman?
