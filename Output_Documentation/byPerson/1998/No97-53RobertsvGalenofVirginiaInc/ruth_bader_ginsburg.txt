justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
with
respect
to
the
response
you
just
gave
that
it
would
be
your
position
that
these
points
were
waived,
but
going
in,
there
was
a
solid
precedent
of
the
sixth
circuit
that
the
district
court
was
obliged
to
follow.
so,
why
would
there
be
any
occasion
as
long
as
that
precedent
stood--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--to...
to
bring
up
things?
but
looking
down
the
road,
maybe
the
supreme
court
will
overturn
the
sixth
circuit's
precedent,
and
then
do
you
have
an
alternate
argument?
i
think
that
you'd
have
to...
you
have
a...
quite
an
uphill
argument
to
make
for
waiver.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
she
was
there
for
some
weeks.
and
what
is
the
point...
does
it
go
on
for
months?
in
her
case
she
was
hospitalized
for
months.
when
does...
when
does
this
obligation
end?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
does
the
secretary
currently
have
no
position
on
a
case
like
this
where
the
stabilization,
according
to
the
plaintiff,
takes
weeks,
even
months
to
occur?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but,
mr.
phillips,
there's
one
question
of
what
you
could
do
on
remand
and
the
other,
what
you
can
do
here.
and
i
was
struck
by
your
position
that
your
new
arguments
could
be
responded
to
in
a
reply
brief,
but
then
the
government,
whose
views
are
of
interest
to
this
court,
is
only
an
amicus
and
has
no
right
to
file
a
reply
brief.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but,
mr.
phillips,
we're
told...
we
were
told
this
morning
that
the
secretary
is
planning
to
have
a
rule
making,
and
doesn't
prudence
dictate
that
we...
we
await
that
full
development
at
the
agency
level
before
attempting
to...
i
mean,
it's
extraordinary
for
this
court
to
take
a
first
view
of
an
issue
rather
than
to
serve
as
a
court
of
review.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
in
your
view,
mr.
phillips,
is
the
office
of
(c)
which
says
that
there
are
two
conditions
under
which
you
could
transfer?
one
is
on
the...
on
consent
and
the
other
on
the
physician
certifying
that
the
risk
of
staying
where
she
is
is
greater
than
the
risk
of
sending
her
someplace
else.
