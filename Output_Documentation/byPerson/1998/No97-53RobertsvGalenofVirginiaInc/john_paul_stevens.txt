mr.
phillips,
as
i
understand,
mr.
feldman's
point
is
that
this
area
is
under
review
by
the
secretary
who's
contemplating
regulations
and
so
forth.
would
you
comment
on
whether
you
agree
that
those
regulations
might
be
helpful
in
addressing
the
issues
that
you
have
raised?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
but
isn't
it
true--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--isn't
it
true,
mr.
phillips,
that
the...
there
is
an
issue
of
fact
as
to
whether
the
patient
had
ever
stabilized?
isn't
there?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
maybe
that's
part
of
the
problem.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
is
there
an
issue
of
fact
as
to
whether
she
continued
to
be
in
an
emergency
medical
condition?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
are
you
suggesting--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--is
it
your
legal
position
that
even
if
she
was
not
stabilized
at
the
time,
she
could
have
been
transferred
because
she
was
not
in
an
emergency
medical
condition?
is
that
what
you're
saying?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
stabilized
has
a
meaning
other
than
the
termination
of
the
emergency
medical
condition.
