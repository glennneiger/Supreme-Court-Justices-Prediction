mr.
joseph
h.
mattingly,
iii
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
comes
to
this
court
on
the
claim
of
wanda
johnson,
a
kentucky
resident,
who
claims
that
the
respondent
hospital
violated
the
antidumping
provisions
of
the
emergency
medical
treatment
and
active
labor
act
passed
by
congress
in
1986.
ms.
johnson's
claim
was
dismissed
by
the
district
court
on
summary
judgment.
that
dismissal
was
upheld
by
the
court
of
appeals
on
the
sole
issue
of
whether
or
not
the
statute
requires
proof
of
an
improper
motive
on
the
part
of
the
offending
hospital
as
a
prerequisite
for
recovery.
this
court
granted
certiorari
on
that
specific
issue
and
that
specific
issue
only.
the
respondent
in
this
case
has
conceded
that
it
can
no
longer
defend
the
rationale
of
the
lower
courts,
that
the
statute
cannot
be
read
as
requiring
proof
of
an
improper
motive.
therefore,
this
case
is
ripe
for
reversal
and
remand
to
the
trial
court.
this
court
could
make
that
decision
and
say
very
little
more.
mr.
joseph
h.
mattingly,
iii
justice
o'connor,
the
statute
provides,
number
one,
a
duty
on
the
part
of
the
hospital
to
provide
an
appropriate
medical
screening
examination,
and
it
does,
by
definition
of
some
of
the
key
terms,
refer
to
an
obligation
on
the
hospitals
not
to
transfer
patients
if
that
transfer
would
cause
a
substantial
deterioration
in
a
patient's
condition.
so,
arguably,
yes,
it
does
create
a
minimum
standard.
however,
if
we
think
about
what
that
standard
is...
hospital,
you
cannot
transfer
a
patient
if
that
transfer
is
going
to
be
the
cause
of
material
deterioration
in
a
substantial
condition
of
that
patient...
i
can't
imagine
that
any
state
standard
would
be
lower
than
that.
you
can't
transfer
if
that
transfer
is
going
to
be
the
cause
of
deterioration.
mr.
joseph
h.
mattingly,
iii
that's
correct,
your
honor.
however,
the...
the
definition
of...
of
stabilized
and
to
stabilize
indicate
that,
within
reasonable
medical
probability,
no
deterioration
would
occur
to...
to
a
condition
that
the
patient
had
at
the
time
of
transfer.
mr.
joseph
h.
mattingly,
iii
your
honor,
again,
if...
if--
mr.
joseph
h.
mattingly,
iii
--justice
o'connor,
in
my
opinion
no.
unfortunately,
that's
not
an
issue
that--
mr.
joseph
h.
mattingly,
iii
--that
the
parties
have
had
an
opportunity
to
fully
brief--
mr.
joseph
h.
mattingly,
iii
--i
would
disagree
with
that
analysis
for
a
couple
of
reasons,
your
honor.
first
of
all,
there
is...
there...
there
are
several
places
in
the
statute
that
restrictions
are
imposed
upon
hospitals
and
those
restrictions
are
not
confined
to
emergency
rooms.
for
example,
if
you
review
the
transfer
provisions
of
the
statute,
those
provisions
refer
to
transfer
from
a
facility,
which
in
my
view
is
a
much
broader
term
than
simply
transfer
from
an
emergency
room.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
subsection
(a)
of
the
statute
refers
to
the
obligation
to
provide
an
emergency
medical...
excuse
me...
an
appropriate
medical
screening
examination
in
the
emergency
room
or
in
other--
mr.
joseph
h.
mattingly,
iii
--honestly,
justice
o'connor,
it
would
be
our
argument
at
the
district
court
that
that
entire
argument
was
waived.
it
was...
it...
there
was
no
cross
appeal
filed
in
this
case,
and
those
issues
were
never
raised.
the
time
for
filing
dispositive
motions
in
the
trial
court
had
already
passed,
and
so
it
would
be
our
argument
to
the
district
court
that
any
of
those
types
of
arguments
were
waived
by
the
hospital
at
the
district
court
level.
mr.
joseph
h.
mattingly,
iii
no,
justice
o'connor.
ms.
johnson
resides
in
bardstown.
she
is
disabled.
she
lives
in
an
apartment
in
that
city
and...
and
has...
has
substantial
disabilities.
mr.
joseph
h.
mattingly,
iii
justice--
mr.
joseph
h.
mattingly,
iii
--justice
ginsburg,
i
think
that
you
are
correct,
that
there
is
sixth
circuit
precedent
that
would
support
an
argument
that...
that
the
obligations
of
this
statute
apply
outside
of
an
emergency
room,
and
that
i
believe
is
the
reason
that
the
hospital
didn't
raise
this
issue
from
the
very
beginning
of
the
case
because
it
was
pretty
clear
that...
that
the
precedent
in
our
circuit
is
that
it's
not
limited
to...
to
emergency
room
treatment.
the
thorton
case
is
a
case
that's
not
cited
by
the
respondent
hospital,
but
clearly
says
in
that
case...
that
involved
a
patient
who
was
transferred
from
an
emergency
room
first
to
intensive
care
and
then
actually
to
a
regular
hospital
bed.
that's
not
the
case
in
wanda
johnson's
situation.
she
was...
she
never
left
critical
care.
mr.
joseph
h.
mattingly,
iii
again,
justice
ginsburg,
that
is...
that
is
an
issue
that
unfortunately
didn't
get
fully
briefed.
but
my
opinion
would
be
that
there
is
a
very
sound
reading
of
the
statute
that
would
impose
actually
three
separate
and
distinct
obligations
on
hospitals,
not
a...
an
obligation
that
begins
and
somehow
stops
once
the
patient
arrives
in
the
hospital
and
leaves
the
emergency
room.
if
you
look
at
section
(a),
there
is
a
clear
obligation--
mr.
joseph
h.
mattingly,
iii
--section
(a)
of
the
statute.
mr.
joseph
h.
mattingly,
iii
(a).
mr.
joseph
h.
mattingly,
iii
yes.
the
first
section
of
the
statute
provides
a
duty
on
hospitals
that
have
emergency
rooms
or
that
provide
emergency
services
to
undertake
to
provide
this
appropriate
medical
screening
examination
when
an
individual,
any
individual,
comes
to
the
emergency
room.
if
you
then
look
at
section
(b)
of
that
same
statute
where
obligations
are...
are
imposed
on
hospitals,
if
they
determine
that
such
a
condition
exists,
it
does
not
refer
anyplace
in
section
(b)
to
the
patient
having
come
to
the
emergency
room.
then
you
look
at
section
(c)
and
the
introductory
sentence
of
section
(c)
is
also
different.
and
that
section,
the
section
that
specifically
prohibits
transfers
where
a
patient
is
not
stabilized,
refers
to
a
patient
at
a
hospital.
it
doesn't
say
that
when
a
patient
comes
to
a
hospital
and
the
hospital
has
determined
that
this
condition
exists.
it
simply
says
if
you
are
at
a
hospital
and
you
have
an
emergency
medical
condition,
as
defined
in
the
statute,
and
that
condition
has
not
been
stabilized,
then
you
can't
transfer
that
patient.
so--
mr.
joseph
h.
mattingly,
iii
--no,
i
would
not
agree
with
that,
justice
scalia.
i
think--
mr.
joseph
h.
mattingly,
iii
--i
would
welcome
your
help.
mr.
joseph
h.
mattingly,
iii
i
believe
that
section
(a),
the
requirement
that...
that
a
hospital
conduct
an
appropriate
medical
screening
examination,
would
apply
to
any
hospital
that
holds
itself
out
as
providing
emergency
services
whether
they
have
a
departmentalized
emergency
room,
whether
it's
a...
for
example,
a
psychiatric
hospital
that--
mr.
joseph
h.
mattingly,
iii
--i'm
not
familiar
with
a
hospital
in
kentucky
who
does
not.
mr.
joseph
h.
mattingly,
iii
section
(a)?
mr.
joseph
h.
mattingly,
iii
no.
mr.
joseph
h.
mattingly,
iii
correct.
mr.
joseph
h.
mattingly,
iii
section
(b),
it
would
appear
to
me,
is
a
much
broader
scope.
it
would
include
hospitals
that
have
emergency
services.
it
would
also...
it
would
also
include
hospitals
that
perhaps
don't
provide
emergency
services,
if
there
are
such
hospitals.
mr.
joseph
h.
mattingly,
iii
mm
hmm.
and--
mr.
joseph
h.
mattingly,
iii
--absolutely,
your
honor,
and
that's
why
section
(b)
in
my
view
is
a
broader...
a
broader
section
of
the
statute
than
section
(a)
because
if
there
are
hospitals
that
don't
provide
emergency
services
or
close
their
emergency
departments,
section
(b)
still
provides
some
obligation
on
that
hospital.
if,
within
the
capacity
or
the
capabilities
of
that
hospital,
they
recognize
the
existence
of
this
emergency
medical
condition,
then
they
still
have
obligations.
to
the
extent
that
they
can
provide
treatment,
they
are
obligated
to
do
so.
their
further
obligation
is
to
try
to
arrange
a
transfer
of
that
patient
to
a
hospital
that
possibly
can
provide
more
care
or
better
care
for
that
particular
condition.
section
(c)
simply
states
that
if
a
patient
is
at
a
hospital,
and
in
section
(c)
there
is
no...
there
is
no
obligation
that
you
can
read
from
that
section
(c),
if
you
interpret
(a),
(b),
and
(c)
as
being
separate
and
distinct,
that
the
patient
enter
through
the
emergency
room
or
that
the
hospital
provide
emergency
services
at
all.
so,
it
would
be
our
view
that...
that
there
is
a
very
viable
reading
of
the
statute
that
would
impose
three
separate
and
distinct
duties
under
sections
(a),
(b),
and
(c)
of
that
statute.
mr.
joseph
h.
mattingly,
iii
not
all
of
the
state
causes
of
action.
in
this
case
the
sixth
circuit
and
the
district
court
determined
that
the
surgical
resident,
the
medical...
medical
school
student
who
signed
the
discharge
of
wanda
johnson,
was
not
the
agent
of
the
hospital.
therefore,
under
kentucky
law
where
the
hospital
would
normally
be
held
liable
vicariously,
the
hospital
could
not
be
held
liable
for
that
medical
student's
negligence.
emtala,
on
the
other
hand,
imposes
direct
liability
on
hospitals
and
would
provide
a
cause
of
action
against
the
hospital
whether
the...
the
medical
student
who
signed
the
discharge
was
the
hospital's
agent
or
not.
mr.
joseph
h.
mattingly,
iii
it
would
appear
that
the
statute
imposes
direct
liability.
now,
kentucky
does
recognize--
mr.
joseph
h.
mattingly,
iii
--anyone's
acts
who
have
a
substantial
impact
on
the
decisions
that
the
hospital
is
required
to
make
under
the
statute.
for
example,
if...
because
the
statute
does
not
impose
these
obligations
on,
for
example,
physicians
to
impose
liability
on
hospitals,
a
private
citizen
does
not
have
a
cause
of
action
under
the
statute
against
a
physician
who
makes...
who
may
violate
the
statute.
that...
that
remedy
is
available
only
to
the
department
for
health
and
human
services.
so,
even
though
kentucky
does,
in
some
circumstances,
recognize
a
hospital's
liability
vicariously
for
the
acts
of...
of
certain
physicians,
in
this
particular
case
the
sixth
circuit
determined
that
these
medical
students
were
not
the
hospital's
agents,
and
therefore
emtala
would
actually
provide
a
broader
remedy
than
state
law
would
against
hospitals
for
that
conduct.
the...
the
statute
would
not...
would
not
create
a
situation
where
every...
every
possible
medical
malpractice
claim
that
occurs
in
a
hospital
setting
turns
into
a
federal
emtala
claim
like
the
hospital
claims
in
this
case
that
it
does,
and
the
reason
for
that
is
that
emtala
is...
is
not
focused
on
the
entire
spectrum
of
hospital
care.
emtala
looks
to
the
beginning
of
that
care
where
it
requires
these
hospitals
to
provide
an
appropriate
medical
screening
examination
and
then
focuses
at
the
end
of
that
hospital
care
toward
the
transfer
of
that
patient
and
making
sure
that
the
transfer
is
not
the
cause
of
a
material
deterioration
in
the
condition.
now,
in
the
middle
of
that
spectrum,
there
is
going
to
be
very
much
medical
care
that's
provided
and
many
medical
procedures
that
may
be
provided.
and
some
of
those
procedures
and
some
of
that
care
may
be
negligent,
may
cause
damage,
and
may
create
causes
of
action
under
states'
medical
malpractice
laws,
but
those
are
not
going
to
create
federal
emtala
violations
because
emtala
is
not
focused
on
that
interim
care.
emtala
is
focused
on
the
requirement
that
the
hospitals
conduct
the
medical
screening
examination
and
focused
at
the
end
of
that
hospitalization
at...
at
whether
the
transfer
itself
is
a
cause
of
a
material
deterioration.
if
there
are
no
other
questions,
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
joseph
h.
mattingly,
iii
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
i
would
like
to
point
out
just
a
few
things.
first
of
all,
the
interpretation
of
the
statute
that
is
proposed
by
the
hospital
is
focused
strictly
at...
at
patient
dumping
from
the
front
end
of
the
hospital,
basically
the
stories
where
hospitals
turn
patients
away.
its
interpretation
totally
ignores
situations
that
are
equally
reprehensible,
and
that
is
the
dumping
of
patients
at
the
other
end
of
the
spectrum,
patients
that
are
hospitalized
and
for
whatever
reason
the
hospital
makes
a
decision
that
this
patient
is
going
to
be
transferred.
mr.
joseph
h.
mattingly,
iii
that
may--
mr.
joseph
h.
mattingly,
iii
--yes,
that...
that
may
be
true,
justice
o'connor,
that
that
was
the
primary
focus
of
congress.
wanda
johnson's
situation
is...
is
a
perfect
example
of
why
federal
law
was
needed
in
this
circumstance.
as
we...
as
we
discussed
earlier,
the
sixth
circuit
decided
that
under
state
law
wanda
johnson
had
no
cause
of
action
against
the
hospital
because
this
medical
student
who
made
this
decision,
even
if
that
decision
was
negligent
and
the
subject
of...
of
state
malpractice
law,
did
not
create
a
cause
of
action
against
the
hospital.
so,
if
in
fact
wanda
johnson
was
dumped
from
the
transfer
end,
without
this
statute
wanda
johnson
has
no
cause
of
action
against
the
hospital,
only
against
a
medical
student
who
made
a
decision
to
invoke
a
transfer
of
this
patient.
i
would
point
out
also
that
even
if
the
court
were
to
accept
any
of
the
arguments
that
are
made
by
the
hospital
in
this
case,
there
still
exists
substantial
factual
issues
that
would...
would
compel
this
court
to
reverse
the
case
and
send
it
back
down
for
review
by
the
lower
courts.
contrary
to
what
the
hospital
argues,
there
is
a
clear
factual
issue
as
to
whether
or
not
an
emergency
medical
condition
existed
with
wanda
johnson
when
she
was
transferred.
the
only
evidence
that
the
hospital
cites
is
the
testimony
of
dr.
miller
who
is
the
only
physician
who
speaks
in
terms
of
an
emergency
medical
condition,
and
dr.
miller
quite
candidly
admits
in
his
deposition
that
he
was
on
vacation
during
the
entire
month
when
wanda
johnson
was
transferred
and
that
his
decision
was
based
on
his
review
of
the
medical
records.
on
the
other
hand,
dr.
john
stuy,
who
was
wanda
johnson's
treating
physician
in
indianapolis,
testified
at
length
in
this
case,
and
his
testimony
can
be
read
to
the
effect
that
wanda
johnson
did
suffer
an
emergency
medical
condition.
now,
he
doesn't
come
right
out
and
say,
i've
read
the
statute
and
she
suffered
an
emergency
medical
condition.
but
he
says
she
needed
the
availability
of
treatment
that
hospitals
provide
and
because
she
was
outside
of
the
confines
of
those
people
who
could
provide
that
treatment,
her
condition
got
substantially
worse.
so,
there...
there
are
factual
issues
that
would
have
to
be
resolved
even
if
any
of
the
arguments
that
the
hospital
makes
in
this
case
were
adopted
and
accepted
by
the
court.
finally,
i
would
point
out
to
the
court
that
there
is
at
least
one
other...
that
one
other
interpretation
of
the...
the
definition
of
a
determination
by
a
hospital.
the
section
(b)
of
the
statute
does
say
if
a
hospital
determines
that
this
condition
exists,
and
the
hospital
would
argue
that
that
is
synonymous
with
actual
knowledge,
and
i'm
not
sure
that
that
is
necessarily
the
interpretation
that
could
be
placed
upon
that...
that
section
of
the
statute.
i
think
it
would
be
very
reasonable
to
assume,
considering
the
context
that
it's
placed
in,
that
that
would
also
include
situations
where
the
hospital
was
intentionally
ignorant
of
important
facts
that
would
have
borne
on
that
determination.
mr.
joseph
h.
mattingly,
iii
if
congress
meant
determines
or...
or
should
have
determined--
mr.
joseph
h.
mattingly,
iii
--well,
mr.
chief
justice,
actually
what
i
mean
is...
is
if...
if
the
plaintiff
can
prove
even
a
higher
standard
than
that.
maybe
the...
maybe
congress
didn't
mean
should...
only
should
have
determined,
but
if
the...
if
the
hospital
was
reckless
in
its
determination.
mr.
joseph
h.
mattingly,
iii
mr.
chief
justice,
i
agree
that
there
are
several
interpretations
of
that
section
of
the
statute,
and
i
point
that
out
only
to...
to
again
argue
to
the
court
that
those
kinds
of
issues
that
are
raised
for
the
first
time
now
have
not
been
adequately
briefed
by
anybody.
thank
you.
