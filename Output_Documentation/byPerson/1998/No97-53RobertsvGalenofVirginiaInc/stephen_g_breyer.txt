justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what...
what
is
it
exactly
that
you...
as
i
read
the
statute...
let's
see
if
i'm
right...
that
a
person
comes
to
a
hospital
and
the
hospital...
that
person
has
an
emergency
medical
condition.
it's
a
very
bad
condition
let's
say.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now,
what
you
have
to
do
as
a
hospital
is
you
have
to
keep
that
person
there
until
the
person
stabilizes.
is
that
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
it
says
you
have
to
give
such
treatment
as
may
be
required
to
stabilize
the
medical
condition--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--or--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--or...
or
transfer
to
another
facility
in
accordance
with
(c).
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
(c)
says
unless
the
person
agrees
or
unless
the
doctor
says
it's
going
to...
she's
going
to
be
better
off
in
that
other
place,
in
the
absence
of
those
two
things,
the
person
has
to
be
stabilized.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it
says...
so...
so,
i
take
it
here
you
haven't
got
a
doctor
who's
going
to
say
she's
better
off,
and
the
person
hasn't
agreed,
and
so
you
have
to
keep
her
unless
she's
stabilized.
and
the
definition
of
stabilized
and
to
stabilize
means
basically
that
you
have
to
certify
that
moving
her
or
discharging
her
isn't
going
to
make
her
significantly
worse.
so,
it
sounds...
the
literal
language
is
that
you
have
to
keep
this
person
who
had
an
emergency
condition
until
you're
certain
or
reasonably
certain,
absent
consent,
absent
better
place
elsewhere,
but
until
you're
reasonably
certain
that
the
transfer
won't
make
her
significantly
worse
off.
now,
if
i'm
right...
and
tell
me
if
i'm
not...
i
want
to
know
what
precisely
you
think
this
court
should
hold
about
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well...
no,
then
fine.
i'm
trying
to
get
at
what
exactly...
which
is
the
part
i'm
not
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
right.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
now,
what
is
it
you
want
us--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--no,
no.
what
is
it
now?
i've
got
that.
i...
i've
adjusted
my
statement
of
it
accordingly.
now,
given
that,
what
is
it
you
want
us
to
hold
precisely?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
how
could
we--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--how
could
we
hold
that
if
the
statute
says
you
have
to
give
her
treatment
to
stabilize
the
condition
or
she
has
to
have
been
stabilized
before
you
can
transfer
her
without
her
consent?
how
could
we
hold
that
if
she
hasn't
stabilized?
