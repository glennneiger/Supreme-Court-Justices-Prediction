i
guess
(a)
certainly
envisions
hospitals
that
don't
have
emergency
departments.
right?
because
it
begins
in
the
case
of
a
hospital
that
has
a
hospital
emergency
department.
so,
it
envisions
hospitals
without
emergency
departments.
and
if
(b)
only
applies
to
emergency
departments,
hospitals
without
emergency
departments,
they're
simply
off
the
hook
entirely.
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
trying
to
help
you.
i
thought
that
that
would
strengthen
your--
[laughter]
i
thought
that
that
would
strengthen
your
case.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
you're
free
to
disagree.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
hospital
doesn't
provide
emergency
services?
is
there...
is
there
a
hospital
that
doesn't
provide
emergency
services?
justice
antonin
scalia
i'd
hate
to
think
there
is
one.
[laughter]
in
which
case,
(a)
doesn't
make
any
sense
when
it
says
in
the
case
of
a
hospital
that
has
a
hospital
emergency
department.
i
mean,
it
obviously
envisions
hospitals
that
don't
have
emergency
departments,
whatever
that
is.
and
you
say
that
that
means
just
treating
emergency
conditions.
so,
you
think
it
envisions
a
hospital
that
doesn't
treat
emergency
conditions.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes.
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
then
it...
then
it
must
envision
hospitals
that
have
emergency
departments.
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
very
point
i
was
making.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
without
that,
all
you
had
to
do
to...
to
evade
the
apparent
intention
of
the
statute
is
simply
not
to
open
an
emergency
department.
justice
antonin
scalia
because...
because
(b)a
in
particular,
when
it
says
that
the
hospital
must
provide
either
within
the
staff
and
facilities
for
such
further
medical
examination
and
such
treatment
as
may
be
required
to
stabilize
the
medical
condition,
the
word
stabilize
there
has
a
very
technical
meaning,
doesn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
as
defined,
it
means
to
assure
no
deterioration
during
transfer.
justice
antonin
scalia
so,
it's
not
the
normal
meaning
that
you'd...
you'd
attribute
to
stabilize.
