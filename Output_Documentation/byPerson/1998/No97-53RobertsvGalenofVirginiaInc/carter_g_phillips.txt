mr.
carter
g.
phillips
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
it
seems
to
me
that
this
is
a
classic
illustration
of
a
case
that...
where
the
result
is
in
search
of
the
appropriate
legal
theory.
as
we
made
plain
in
our...
in
our
brief
in...
before
this
court,
we
do
not
defend
the
actual
motive
test
adopted
by
the
sixth
circuit
because
it's
reasonably
clear
to
us
that
there
is
no
basis
in
the
text
or
the
context
of
this
particular
statute
to
justify
that
particular
analysis.
and
we
do
think
as
hospitals
that
there
are
certainly
certain
situations
where
there
are
absolute
obligations
that
are
imposed
upon
us,
for
instance,
in
providing
some
form
of
a
screening
examination
where
an
inquiry
into
the
hospital's
motive
is
simply
not
an
appropriate
inquiry,
and
on
that
basis
alone,
it's
easy
for
us
to
set
aside
the
actual
motive
test.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
that's
correct,
justice
o'connor,
although--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--well,
i
hope
at
least
in
part
they're
well
briefed.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
to
be
sure,
and...
and...
and
the
question
really
is,
is
this
a
proper
instance
in
which
the
court
ought
to
exercise
its
discretion
to
resolve
a...
a
pure
question
of
law.
and
i
do
think
the
question
of
when
emtala
ends
is
a
pure
question
of
law
that
the
court
can
address
pretty
readily
by
looking
at
the
statute.
i
guess
what
i'd...
you
know,
in
terms
of
why
the
issue
wasn't
raised
previously,
if
the
court
were
to
adopt
a
categorical
rule
that
says
the
failure
to
bring
this
up
in
the
sixth
circuit
somehow
prohibits
us
or
should
preclude
us
from
being
allowed
to
bring
it
forward,
here
would
have
had
us
be
required
to
make
arguments
in
support
of
a
judgment
below
in
a
case
where
it
seemed
quite
clear
that
the
sixth
circuit
law
was
categorically
in
our
favor
as
justice--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--well,
there's
no
question
about
that,
justice
ginsburg.
on
the
other
hand,
it
is
reasonably
clear
to
me
that
had
the
government
filed
a
motion
for
leave
to
file
a
reply
brief
in
the
circumstances
of
this
case,
that
that
motion
would
most
likely
have
been
granted.
i
have
as
a
private
litigant
on
occasion
filed
at
the...
an
amicus
brief
at
that
stage
in
the
process
or
at
the
respondent
stage
even
though
i
was
supporting
the
petitioner,
and
the
court
has
authorized
it
in
circumstances
in
which
new
issues
have
been
put
forward
in
a
particular
case.
so,
i
don't
doubt
that
if
the
solicitor...
and
we
certainly
would
not
have
opposed
the
solicitor
general
briefing
the
issue
if
he
had
chosen
to
do
so.
and
i
assume
the
reason
he
chose
not
to
do
so
is
that
he
can't
seem
to
categorically
decide
what
he
thinks
the
term
stabilize
means
within--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--i...
i
think
on...
on
the
two
particular
questions
that
we're
talking
about,
we
would
almost
certainly
be
in
what
i
would
regard
as
a
chevron
one
world
where
congress
has
spoken
quite
specifically
to
the
particular
problems,
the
two
questions
being,
does
emtala
end
when
a
hospital
admits
the
patient
for...
for
treatment
of...
of
the
emergency
medical
condition?
it
seems
to
me
quite
clear
that
the
definition
of
stabilized
at...
at
the
appendix
to
the
petitioner's
brief
at
a8
which
talks
about
significant
deterioration
from
or
during
the
transfer
clearly
has
in
mind
the
discussion
of
a
transfer
arising
at
the
time
of
the
entry
into
the
emergency
medical
setting
and
not
just
any
transfer
that
might
take
place
down
the
road.
and
so,
i
would
argue
that
if
the
secretary
were
to
enact
a
regulation
that
extends
a
generalized
duty
along
the
lines
that
is
obliquely
referred
to
in
the
solicitor
general's
brief,
that
extends
months
later
after
care
is
being
given,
that
that
would
violate
congress'
clear
command.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
subsection--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--right.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
correct.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
yes.
i
don't--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--no.
i
read
this
all
as
a...
as
a
single...
as
a
seamless
web,
and
i
think
it's
the
way
the
solicitor
general's
brief
describes
it,
which
is
that
the
statute
(c)
doesn't
deal
with
independent
sets
of
duties,
it
deals
with
sequential
sets
of
duties.
and
so,
the
first
question
is,
do
you
have...
do
you
have
an
emergency
room?
if
you
don't
have
an
emergency
room,
then
the
does
statute
does
not
apply.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
correct.
there's
no...
yes.
congress
did
not
mean
to
require
very
small
institutions
in
rural
communities
to
create
emergency
rooms
if
they
didn't
have
the
resources
to
do
that
as
a
condition
to
the
acceptance
of
medicare
funds.
so...
and
there
are
such
facilities,
justice
scalia.
i
know
you
asked
that
question.
so,
you
don't
have
that
obligation.
but
then
the
question
is
if
you
do
have
an
emergency
room
and
an
individual
is
presented
to
you,
you
have,
one,
an
immediate
obligation
to
provide
an
appropriate
screening
examination,
and
then
two,
if
at
the
end
of
the
appropriate
screening
examination
you
conclude
that
the
individual
has
an
emergency
medical
condition,
then
one
of
three
courses
follow
from
that.
either
you
admit
the
patient,
and
i
would
submit,
given
the
statutory
scheme,
we're
done
at
that
point.
or,
two,
you
decide
you're
going
to
transfer
the
patient
to
somewhere
else
and
you're
going
to
provide
that
patient
with
stabilizing
treatment,
realizing
that
that's
designed
simply
to
get
the
patient
from
facility
a
to
facility
b
without
a
significant
deterioration
in
the...
in
the
patient's
condition
during
that...
just
during
that
period.
and
that's
all
the
statute
is
designed
to
get
at.
or
three,
if
you
cannot
provide
stabilizing
care
for
whatever
reason
and
you
still
believe
that
the
transfer
has
to
be
done,
then
you
have
to
go
through
the
sequence
of
events
under
subsection
(c),
and
that's
what
i
think
this
statute
is
designed
to
get
at.
that's
why
it's
called
emergency...
the
emergency
treatment
act,
and
that
is
precisely
the
limitation
of
why
it
ought
to
be
resolved.
and
so,
that's
the
first
element,
and
i
think
that's...
that's
a
clear
question
of
law,
justice
stevens.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
every
court
of
appeals
that
has
addressed
this
issue
to
date
has
embraced
our...
well,
no,
that's
true.
there
is
a
split
actually.
there
is
dicta.
it's
not
a
holding
of
the
sixth
circuit,
but
there
is
some
considered
dicta
in
the
thorton
case
that
petitioner's
counsel
referred
to
that
says
that
the
obligations
of
emtala
go
on
beyond
the
emergency
room
setting.
but
every
other
court
that
has
analyzed
the
question
since
then,
the
fourth
circuit,
the
tenth
circuit
specifically,
have
concluded
that
this
is
a
question
that
emtala's
obligations
end
when
you're
admitted
and
that
that
issue
and
if
the
court
of
appeals
had
rendered
a
decision
precisely
on
that
question
in
this
case,
we
would
still
be
here
today
arguing
about
this.
and
so
then
the
only
real
issue
is,
does
the
briefing
of
the
case
in
some
sense
make
the
court
reluctant
to
resolve
the
issue?
and
i
think
it's
a
reasonably
clear
legal
question
that
the
court
can
resolve--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--well,
obviously
the
announcement
this
morning
was
as
much
a
surprise
to
me
as
it
presumably
was
to
the
court.
i
don't
disagree
that
an
act
of...
that
prudence
might
suggest
that...
with
respect
to
this
particular
issue,
the...
the
court
may
want
to
hold
off.
i
did
not
hear
mr.
feldman
make
any
reference,
however,
to
the
question
of
what
determines
means
within
the...
within
the
statute,
and
that's
a
separate
issue
that
has
been
fully
briefed
as
well.
there's
not
even
a
question
as
to
whether
that
has
been
preserved
in
the
courts
below.
we
certainly
referenced
that
argument.
and
there
is
no
question
here
that...
that
the
hospital
at
the
time
of
this...
of
this
transfer,
even
though
i
don't
think
it's
subject
to
the
act,
nevertheless,
the
hospital
clearly
did
not
determine
that
she
had
a...
an
emergency
medical
condition
at
the
time
of
that
transfer.
so,
i
would
at
least--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--ask
the
court
to
resolve
that
question.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
i
don't
know
what
stabilized
means
in
that
context.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
but
that's
not
the
statutory
language
that's
relevant
here.
the
question
is
whether
she
was
in
an
emergency
medical
condition
at
that
point,
not
whether
she's
stabilized.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
i
don't
know
that
there
is
a...
no,
there's
not
a
shred
of
evidence
in
this
record...
and
it
would
be
the
plaintiff's
burden
to
bring
forward
the
evidence...
that
demonstrated
that
she
was
in
an
emergency
medical
condition
at
the
time
of
this
transfer.
there
is
a
factual
question...
and
i
don't
dispute
this
and
we
conceded
it
in
the
courts
below...
that,
quotes,
whether
she
was
stabilized
at
the
time
is...
is
an
open
issue.
i
don't
know
what
the...
what
the
parties
or
the
court--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--thought
stabilized
meant
in
that
context.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
yes,
because
i
believe
that
it
being
an
emergency
medical
condition
is
a
precondition
to
any
of
the
other
obligations
with
respect
to
a
transfer.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
that's
correct,
justice
stevens.
if
you
look
at
the
appendix
to
the
petitioner's
brief
at
a8
and
you
analyze
the
definition
of
stabilizing
treatment
and
to
stabilize,
it
talks
very
precisely
about
assuring
that
the
emergency
medical
condition
does
not
deteriorate
from
or
during
the
time
of
the
transfer.
it
is
a
remarkably
narrow
and
focused
definition,
very
unlike
what
you
might
ordinarily
expect,
and
particularly
unlike
what
you
would
expect
if
congress
had
intended
to
impose
a
much
broader
set
of...
of
obligations
on
a
hospital
arising
anytime
there
happens
to
be
a
transfer.
in
that
regard,
it's
worth
noting,
of
course,
that
the...
that
the...
you
know,
transfer
includes
discharge.
so,
you're
talking
about
every
patient
who
comes
into
the
emergency
room
is
eventually
going
to
leave
the
hospital...
god
willing...
and
in
that
situation,
you
are
going
to
have
an
emtala...
an
emtala
claim
arising
potentially
because
you've
released
the
patient.
and
they'll
have
a
fight
over
whether
they're,
quote,
stabilized
or
what
the
condition
of
the
patient
was.
and
you
would
expect
for
that
kind
of
a...
of
an
enormous
sea
change
in
the
relationship
between
federal
and
state
law
in
an
area
that's
traditionally
been
regulated
by
the
states,
medical
malpractice,
to
be
something
that
congress
would
at
least
have
made
some
kind
of
specific
references
to.
and
yet,
you
know,
the
legislative
history
talks
in
terms
of
a...
of
filling
the
gap,
providing
duties
that
otherwise
wouldn't
exist
as
a
matter
of
state
law.
and
here
you're
talking
about
discharging
a
patient
after
providing
2
and
a
half
month...
months
of
treatment.
clearly,
state
law
provides
duties
that
would
arise
in
that
setting.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
to
be
sure,
mr.
chief
justice,
that...
is
the...
the
effort
that's
usually
put
in.
obviously,
ms.
johnson
was
in
horrible
condition
as
she
came
into
the...
into
the
emergency
room,
and
i
think
the
university
of
louisville
did
what
its
mission
has
been
to
do
for
hundreds
of...
for
a
hundred
years,
which
is
it
took
the
patient
into
the
emergency
room.
it
immediately
admitted
her,
and
it
immediately
provided
her
with
extraordinary
and
extensive
care
and
then
continued
to
care
for
her
in
an
intensive
care
setting
and
then
in
a
step
down
intensive
care
setting.
realize,
this
hospital
has
17
intensive
care
beds,
and
this
is
one
of
the
largest
hospitals
in
the
state
of
kentucky.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
okay,
justice
breyer.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
no.
i
don't...
i
don't
read
the
statute--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--the
only...
my
only
objection--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--the
next
subsection
also
says--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--right.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
right.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
you're
not
right.
so,
i
don't
know
what
to
say
about
the
second
question.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
what
the
statute
says
is
that
if...
if
you
don't
make
a
decision
to
admit
her--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--you
decide
you're
going
to
transfer
her,
you
have
to
follow
one
of
two
courses.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
you
have
to
provide
her
stabilizing
care,
that
is,
care
that
within
a
reasonable
medical
probability
is
designed
to
ensure
that
her
emergency
medical
condition
will
not
deteriorate
during
or
from
the
transfer.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
that's
the
care
you
provide,
and
then
you
transfer
her.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
if,
on
the
other
hand,
you
decide
you
can't
do
that
for
whatever
reason
and
you
transfer
her
anyway,
then
you
have
to
go
through
(c)
which
requires
consent
and
the
certification
and
all
the
rest
of
the
process
that
follows
from
that.
so,
i
don't...
i
don't--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--was
that
i
have
to
keep
her
in
some
sense.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
okay.
first
i
would
like
for
the
court
to
hold
that
when
the
hospital
admitted
her
at
that
point
to
provide
her
with
the
treatment
for
her
emergency
medical
condition,
that
satisfied
any
obligations
it...
it
had
under
emtala,
and
emtala
is
not
a
statute
that
rises--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--from
the
ashes
after
it's
been
satisfied.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
because
the...
the
question
is
what
are
the
three...
what
are
the
options
that
are
available
under
this
statute
to
the
hospital:
to
transfer
her
and
what
you
have
to
do
in
order
to
do
that...
and
there
are
two
different
ways
you
can
proceed
with
respect
to
transfer...
or
you
can
admit
her.
if
you
admit
her
and
provide
her
with
care,
state
law
kicks
in
and
all
of
the
obligations
of
state
law
are
then
applied.
and
there
is
no
need
for
the
federal
statute
at
that
point
and
the
statute
ends
at
that
point.
that's...
and...
and
you
know,
you
can
read
the
words
out
of
context
to
say
that
you
have
some
overarching
duty
to
stabilize
any
medical
condition
during
the
time
of
a...
of
hospitalization
that
kicks
in
at
the
point
of
discharge
or
transfer.
but
i
don't
think
that's
the
fair
reading
of
this
statute
in
context.
what
it's
talking
about
is
what
you
do
in
the
emergency
medical--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--that's
correct,
justice
scalia.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
specifically
during
the
period
of
transfer.
that's
correct.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
right.
it's
not
the
term
we
hear
in
the...
in
the
evening
news
that
the
patient
is
in
stable
condition.
i
don't
think
that
term
and
this
term
have
any
resemblance
to
each
other,
although
there's
a
tendency
i
think,
because
it's
a
term
we...
we
hear
a
lot,
to
assume
that
it
has,
you
know,
an
ordinary
meaning.
but
it
doesn't
have
an
ordinary
meaning,
and
that's...
that's
the
very
point
of
our
argument
in
this--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--i...
i
don't
believe,
justice
kennedy,
that
this
statute
would
come
back
in
under
those
circumstances
because
you're
in
the
hospital,
you're
not
being...
you're
not...
because
it
talks
about
coming
to
the
hospital.
that's
the
triggering
event.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
right.
well,
if
she's
in
the
hospital,
she's
not
coming
to
a
hospital.
so,
i
would
assume
that
the
statute
is
not
meant
to
deal
with
that
problem.
it
clearly
is
not
aimed
at
that
situation,
and
there
would
be
no
need
for
federal
law
to
impose
duties
on
a...
on
a
hospital
to
respond
to
a
patient
in
an
emergency
condition
who
has
been
admitted
and
is
under
care
at
the
hospital
whether
she
fell
out
of
bed
or
for
whatever
reason.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
absolutely,
justice
kennedy,
i
believe
state
law
does
provide
remedies.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
right.
justice
ginsburg,
(c)
arises
in
the
situation
where
the
condition
has
not
been
stabilized,
and
presumably
that's
because
the...
the
hospital
has
made
a
basic
determination
that
it's
simply
not
capable
of
providing
whatever
care
is
necessary
within
reasonable
medical
probability
to
ensure
against
the
potential
deterioration.
and
in
that
situation,
you
have
to
go
to
these
additional
procedures.
and
it
makes
sense
because
let's
think
about
the
situation
we're
dealing
with
here.
we're
talking
about
a
situation
where
a
patient
comes
to
the
hospital,
is
determined
to
have
an
emergency
medical
condition,
and
you
are
shipping
that
person
out
without
providing
him
or
her
with
any
care.
that...
that
is
the
classic
situation
that
ought
to...
ought
to
raise
red
flags,
and
so
congress
protected
against
that
precise
situation
by
saying,
we're
going
to
expect
you
to
go
through
some
additional
hurdles
if
you...
if
you
decide
to
go
down
that
particular
path.
and
that's...
that
is
i
think
what
subsection
(c)
is
designed--
indeed,
i
think
if...
if
you
accept
the
narrow
interpretation
of
the
term
stabilized
as...
as...
as
it's
written
in
the
statute
and
understand
it
in
that
context,
the
statute
actually
begins
to
make
a
whole
lot
more
sense.
a
lot
of
the
difficulties
in
trying
to
make
any
kind
of
sense
out
of
this...
out
of
this
provision
comes
from
the
fact
that
you
have
these
ongoing
duties
that
i
don't
think
congress
ever
intended
to
apply.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
no,
i
don't
believe
the
statute
has
been
violated.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
except
that
the...
well,
i
suppose
that
you're
right
in
the
sense
that
the
stabilized
with
respect
to
the
car
ride
would
itself
cause
her
a
particular
problem.
i
mean,
the...
the...
the...
you
know,
the
truth
is
there...
the
statute
doesn't
specifically
say
that
the
obligations
of
emtala
end
at
this
particular
point
in
time.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
i
don't
dispute
that...
that
there
is
a
technical
reading
of
the
statute
that
would
support
that
particular
outcome,
but
it
is...
but
the...
but
it
is
so
counter
both
to
state
law
and
to...
to
intuitive
judgment
about
what
a
hospital
would
do
that
i
don't
think
it's
within
intendment
of
this
particular
statute.
i
mean,
i
don't
disagree
that
you
can
interpret
the
definition
of
stabilize.
but
i
think
the...
the
more
natural
reading
of
that
term
in
context
is
designed
to
say
what
we're
going
to
focus
on
is
that
immediate
transfer
out
of
the
emergency
medical
condition,
and
that
this
is
not
a
statute
that
remotely
suggests
what
you
do
once
you...
you
place
the
entire
arm
of
state
tort
law
and
malpractice
law
around
the
patient
by
admitting
the
patient
into
the
hospital.
and
that's
where
i
think
this
statute
clearly
is
intended
to
draw
the
line,
which
is
why
even
though
you
could
read
the
language
of
stabilized
out
of
context
to
apply
to
that
situation,
it's
clear
to
me
congress
didn't
mean
it
and
congress
wouldn't
have
needed
it
because
if
you
have
a
patient
who's
getting
hospital
orders
to
stay
in
the
hospital,
i
mean,
there
are
more
state
law
violations
arising
out
of
the
transfer
of
that
patient
than
you
can
shake
a
stick
at.
and...
and
it's
clear
to
me
that
federal
law
doesn't
need...
the
department
of
hhs
and...
and
two
different
private
cause
of
action
in
order
to
deal
with
that
kind
of
a
problem.
that's...
you
know,
there's
nothing
in
this
statute
that
remotely
suggests
that
congress
meant
to
significantly
alter
the
relationship
between
federal
and
state
law
in
this
setting.
and
it's
not
a
provision,
as
i
said,
that
goes
away
at
some
point
and
then
resurfaces.
there's
nothing
in
the
language
that...
that
justifies
that
kind
of...
of
an
interpretation.
i
think
i've
exhausted
the
court's
questions,
if
not
the
court.
[laughter]
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i
urge
the
court
to
affirm.
