mr.
james
a.
feldman
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i'd
like
to
address
two
points.
first,
i'd
like
to
address
the
question
on
which
the
court
granted
certiorari
which
is
whether
an
improper
motive
must
be
shown
in
an
emtala
subsection
(b)
case.
second,
i'd
like
to
address
the
reasons
why,
given
the
respondent
has
conceded
the
question
presented...
the
reasons
why
this
court
should
not
reach
the
additional
issues
that
respondent
has
raised
for
the
first
time
in
respondent's
brief
on
the
merits.
now,
with
respect
to
the
question
of--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--they...
it
was
certainly
the
first
time
they
were
raised
in
this
court.
whether
they
were
raised
in
the
court
of
appeals
or
the
district
court
is
a...
probably
a
more
complicated
question.
it
depends
on
certain
specific
references
to
the
briefs.
actually
i
think
it's
doubtful
that
at
least
the
second
question
was
raised
at
all
in
the
litigation
given
what
respondent
stated
in
its
brief
where
it
claimed
that
it
raised
that
question.
it
doesn't
seem
to
have
done
so
to
me.
but
in
any
event,
at
least
for
the
first
time
in
this
court.
with
respect
to
the
question
of
bad
motive,
there's
nothing
in
the
language
of
the
statute
that
suggests
or
permits
an
inference
that
bad
motive
must
be
shown.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
right.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
that's
correct.
and
in
fact,
we...
in
our
view,
even
subsection
(a)
doesn't...
doesn't
suggest
that
bad
motive
is
required,
but
certainly
there's
nothing
in
subsection
(b)
that
would--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--they
don't...
it
doesn't
use
the
word
appropriate.
in
fact,
that
was
my
other
point,
that
in
a
subsection
(b)
case
the
standard,
the
substantive
standard
of
care,
is
fairly
clearly
written
right
in
the
terms
of
the
statute.
the
hospital's
basic
obligation
is
to
stabilize
the
patient
under
subsection
(b).
stabilization
is
defined
as
assuring,
within
reasonable
medical
probability,
that
the
patient's
condition
will
not
deteriorate
during
or
because
of
a
transfer.
now,
it
seems
to
us
that
that
reasonable
medical
probability
standard
is
a
familiar
one
and
essentially
answers
the
question
of
the
standard
of
care.
it's
not
a
motive
based,
subjective
standard.
it's
an
objective
standard,
a
reasonable
medical
standard,
that's
not
unfamiliar
from
other
areas
of
law
and
that
congress
adopted
as
a
minimum
floor
that
hospitals
must
satisfy
under
subsection
(b).
that
conclusion
is
supported
by
several
other
operative
sections
of
the...
of
the
statute
that
also
embody
reasonable
medical
type
standards,
both
in
the
definition
of
what
an
emergency
medical
condition
is,
in
the...
in
the
doctor's
obligations
of
what
the
doctor
must
do
if
the
doctor
wants
to--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--the
constitutional
basis?
mr.
james
a.
feldman
i
think
it
was
both
the
spending
clause
and
the
commerce
clause.
it's
important
that
emtala
is
not
a
law
that
operates
per
se
on
all
hospitals
in
the
country.
it's
a
part
of
the
medicare
act,
and
what
congress
said
is,
if
hospitals
want
to
participate
in
the
medicare
act,
which
they
generally
find
it
beneficial
to
do,
they
have
to
undertake
this
obligation
under
emtala.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
that's
correct.
it's
only
as
a
part
of
the
medicare.
and
actually
that
was
the
other
point
i
wanted
to
get
to
which
was
in
addition
to
the
language
of
the
statute,
the
secretary
has...
of
hhs,
who
has
authority
to
issue
regulations
under
the
medicare
act
and
who
administers
part
of
the
medicare
act
generally
and
emtala
in
particular...
the
secretary
has
also
stated
that
no
improper
motive
be
found.
and
it's
our
view
that
that
statement
is
entitled
to
deference,
and
that
should
settle
the
question,
if
there
were
any
doubt,
about
the
statutory
language
on
that
point.
now,
the
lack
of
any...
of
a
motive
requirement
in
emtala
is
sufficiently
clear
that
respondent's
in
its
brief
on
the
merits
conceded
it.
in
our
view,
the
court
should
not
reach
any
question
in
the
case,
especially
the
two...
in
particular
the
two
questions
that
respondent
raised.
i
am
authorized
to
inform
the
court
this
morning
that
the
secretary
of
hhs
intends
to
institute
a
rule
making,
in
part
as
a
result
of
this
case
and
in
part
as
a
result
of
generally
looking
at
the
situation
under
the
statute,
to
try
to
work
out
some
of
the
other
issues
under
the
statute.
and
i...
i
think
it
would
be...
the
secretary
would
like
to
be
able
to
do
that,
to
apply
her
expertise
in
the
area,
and
look
at
the
question,
in
particular
some
of
the
questions
that
have
been
raised
regarding
how
far
a
hospital's
obligation
extends
and
how
long
it
extends
under
emtala.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
the...
there
is
no
position.
i
would...
maybe
it
might
help,
though,
because
you
used
the
term
stabilized,
to
point
out
that
under
the
statute,
there
really
are
two
kind
of
polar
ways
of
looking
at
it.
one
is
if
you
look
at
the
definition
of
stabilization,
it's
defined
in
terms
of
assuring
that
there's
no
deterioration
of
the...
of
the
patient's
condition
during
the
transfer.
and
that
suggests
that
the
term
stabilization
is
not...
and
the
secretary
has
said
this...
is
not
a
medical
term
under
the
statute.
it's
a
defined
statutory
term
and
it
doesn't
really
make
sense
necessarily
to
talk
about
somebody
being
stabilized
outside
of
the
context
of
a
particular
transfer
that's
contemplated.
so,
under
that
view,
which
i
think
is
probably
petitioner's
view,
that
duty
operates
at
the
end
of
the
hospital
stay
pretty
much
no
matter
how
long
it
was.
there
would
be
another
view
i
think
that...
that
in
order
for
the
stabilization
requirement
to
apply,
the
hospital
must
determine
that
there's
an
emergency
medical
condition.
and
i
think
another
possible
reading
of
the
statute
would
be
that
if
the
hospital
at
some
point
determines
that
there's
no
longer
an
emergency
medical
condition,
that
that
would
terminate
the
hospital's
obligations.
so,
i
think
there's
at
least
those
two
polar
ways
of
looking
at
the
statute
and
there's
probably
some
in
between
cases
too,
and
the
secretary
would
like
the
opportunity
to
institute
a
rule
making
and
look
at
the
question
thoroughly
and
develop
a
view
on
the
statute.
so,
for
that
reason,
as
well
as
the
belated
nature
of
respondent's
presentation
of
the
issues
and
the
fact
that
there
probably
are
some
unresolved
factual
disputes
on
which
the...
these
other
two
issues
are
premised,
the
government
believes
that
the
court
shouldn't
reach
those
issues
in
this
case.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
that
completes
my
argument.
