mr.
james
r.
young
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
explaining
why
the
second
circuit
was
wrong,
i'd
like
to
focus
on
two
legal
principles.
the
first
is
that
an
antitrust
case
brought
by
a
disappointed
supplier
must
contain
adequate
allegations
of
harm
to
competition
and
not
just
harm
to
the
competitor,
and
the
second
is
that
that
harm-to-competition
requirement
is
not
met
simply
by
an
allegation
that
the
supplier
was
terminated
for
a
bad
reason,
even
if
that
reason
is
in
violation
of
laws
other
than
the
antitrust
laws.
the
lower
courts
have
repeatedly
used
these
principles
to
deal
efficiently
and
appropriately
with
meritless
but
tempting
treble
damage
antitrust
suits
brought
by
suppliers
and
distributors
in
the
lower
courts
and,
in
doing
so,
they
have
been
consistent
with
the
principles
of
gte
sylvania
and
sharp,
because
the
very
cost
of
this
litigation
alone...
these
cases
go
on
for
years.
the
expenses
are
tremendous.
these
costs
are
a
tremendous
chill
on
the
right
to,
a
purchaser's
right
to
change
suppliers
freely,
which
is
the
essence
of
the
competitive
process.
the
second
circuit
made
a
substantive
error.
it
extended
group
boycott
law
to
cover
a
vertical
nonprice
agreement
despite
the
clear
requirement
that
a
group
boycott
requires
a
horizontal
agreement.
now,
the
second
circuit
made
this
error
apparently
because
it
confused
an
alleged
regulatory
fraud
in
the
telephone
services
market,
the
aim
of
which
was
to
raise
local
telephone
rates,
for
a
competitive
problem,
but
this
case
has
nothing
to
do
with
rivalry
among
providers
of
local
telephone
service.
discon
in
its
brief
acknowledges
that.
now,
apparently,
because
of
this
confusion
the
second
circuit
did
not
even
examine
whether
there
were
concrete
allegations
of
market-wide
harm
to
competition
in
the
removal
services
market,
which
is
the
only
relevant
market
here.
mr.
james
r.
young
it's
very
relevant
for
regulatory
purposes,
but
the
question
in
a
rule
of
reason
analysis
in
the
removal
services
market
is
whether
or
not
a
price
now
put
in
the
conditions
of
competition
in
that
market
were
changed,
where...
mr.
james
r.
young
the...
i
think
the
important
portion
that
is
relevant
under
the
rule
of
reason,
as
i
say,
it's
not
whether
local
telephone
rates
were
raised.
there
are
regulatory
commissions
to
examine
those
issues.
the
question
is,
what
were
the
terms
of
rivalry
in
the
removal
services
market,
and
that's
really
where
the
second
circuit
i
think
missed
the
boat.
it
did
not
even
examine
whether
or
not
there
was
harm
to
competition
in
that
market.
now,
one
of
the
most...
mr.
james
r.
young
in
a
rule
of
reason
case,
justice
kennedy,
i
think
that
fact,
the
fact
that
costs
were
passed
on,
is
irrelevant
to
the
rule
of
reason
antitrust
analysis.
mr.
james
r.
young
that's
the
core
of
the
case,
your
honor.
mr.
james
r.
young
just...
mr.
james
r.
young
no,
i
don't
believe
they
have,
and
i'd
like
to
explain
why.
what
happened...
mr.
james
r.
young
the
complaint
alleges
at
least
four
people,
four
companies
in
the
business.
there
was
discon,
there
was
at&t,
there
was
a
company
called
lisn,
which
i
believe
is
pronounced
lisn,
and
there
was
an
individual
named
mcgee.
all
are
alleged
in
the
complaint
as
being
in
the
business.
actually,
the
new
york
public
service
commission,
which
conducted
a
detailed
inquiry
into
this,
in
the
public
record
of
that
proceeding
is
the
fact
that
there
were,
in
fact,
a
very
large
number
of
people
competing
in
this
business.
to
the
question
about
price
and
output,
though,
price
and
output,
that
is,
in
the
removal
services
market,
that
is
the
critical
factor,
but
the
allegation
here
is
that
new
york
telephone
voluntarily
paid
more
than
the
market
price.
it's
the
same
sort
of
situation
as
if
the
procurement
officer
at
nynex
had
decided
to
give
the
money
to
his...
to
give
the
business
to
his
brother-in-law
and
pay
his
brother-in-law
an
extra
20
percent.
that
doesn't
change
the
market
price.
mr.
james
r.
young
i
think...
mr.
james
r.
young
i
think
what
matters
about
it
is
that
if
there
is
no
change
in
the
terms
of
rivalry
in
the
removal
services
market,
and
i'd
like
to
get
to
that
in
a
minute,
why
i
think
that's
true,
then
the
fact
that
a
buyer
voluntarily
pays
more
doesn't
change
the
market
price,
doesn't
change
the
market
output.
that
is
unchanged.
the
question
is,
if
new
york
telephone
decided
at
one
point
that
it
didn't
want
to
be
a
part
of
this
alleged
scheme
any
more,
could
it
go
into
the
market
and
get
the
competitive
price
for
removal
services,
and
it
could,
for
i
think
a
very
fundamental
reason.
this
court
in
mitsushita,
in
talking
about
what
market
power
means
and
the
elements
of
market
power,
has
indicated
that
barriers
to
entry
are
critical,
that
you
can't
maintain
supracompetitive
prices
without
market
power
without
barriers
to
entry.
mr.
james
r.
young
i
think
the
reason
that
it
would
return
to
the
competitive
price
is
the
fact
in
this
industry,
where
there
are
no
barriers
to
entry,
the
complaint
alleges
not
just
that
these
people
were
in
the
market,
but
that
this
business
can
and
was
performed
by
telephone
companies
for
themselves.
mr.
james
r.
young
right.
mr.
james
r.
young
no,
i
don't
agree,
and
the
reason
i
don't
agree
is
the
point
i'm
coming
back
to
with
barriers
to
entry.
the
original
complaint,
and
this
is
the
joint
appendix
at
page
15
to
17,
indicates
how
easy
and
quick
it
was
for
somebody
to
get
into
this
business,
which
is
really
just
the
first
cousin
of
the
salvage
business.
discon
got
into
business
in
june
of
1984.
within
30
days
it
had
$500,000
worth
of
business.
it
had
plans
to
ramp
up
its
operation
here
fairly
dramatically.
so
i
think
the
important
point
is
that
if
there
are
no
barriers
to
entry,
then
there
is
absolutely
no
reason
to
suspect,
and
a
district
court
faced
with
this
kind
of
complaint
can
reasonably
conclude
that
there
is
no
adequate
allegation
here
of
harm
to
competition.
there
is
only
an
allegation
that
a
purchaser
voluntarily
agreed
to
pay
more
than
the
market
price.
mr.
james
r.
young
well,
it
is
true...
mr.
james
r.
young
i'm
sorry,
justice
scalia.
mr.
james
r.
young
you
could
certainly
analyze
it...
mr.
james
r.
young
but
it
was...
mr.
james
r.
young
excuse
me,
your
honor.
mr.
james
r.
young
i
agree
that
the
allegation
is
that
they
were
exercising
monopoly
power
in
the
telephone
services
market,
but
the
important
point
is,
that's
not
the
relevant
market
for
the
analysis
here.
the
relevant
market
is
the
removal
services
market.
there's
understandably
some
confusion
because
the...
of
course,
the
theory
of
the
harm
in
this
case
has
been
very
much
a
moving
target
throughout
the
history
of
this
litigation,
but
stripped
to
its
essentials
you
can
put
the
monopoly,
the
allegation
about
telephone
services
aside,
because
that's
not
the
relevant
market
for
this
case.
what
is
critical
is
the
removal
services
market,
where
there
were
no
barriers
to
entry,
where
entry
was
easy,
and
so
there
was
no
reason
to
think
that
the
terms
of
competition
were
altered
at
all.
mr.
james
r.
young
in
the
purchase
of
removal
services?
mr.
james
r.
young
well,
certainly
i
think
you
have
to
say
the
complaint
fairly
alleges
that
there
were
two
principal
buyers
of
removal
services,
but
the
allegations
of
the
complaint
are
focused
on
the
provider's
side
of
the
equation
and,
of
course,
here,
since
this
is...
we're
considering
a
motion
to
dismiss,
we
have
to
take
the
allegations
in
the
complaint.
mr.
james
r.
young
that's
correct.
mr.
james
r.
young
only
if
there
were
adequate
allegations
that
the
terms
of
market-wide
competition
in
the
removal
services
market
had
changed,
and
here...
here
i
come
back
to
what
i
tried
to
explain
before.
because
of
the
barriers
to
entry
point,
then
there
shouldn't
be
any
concern.
mr.
james
r.
young
that
was
one
of
the
allegations
pressed
below,
that
you
could
say
that,
if
i
understand
the
question
correctly,
that
there
was
a
conspiracy
between
two
separate
subsidiaries
of
nynex.
mr.
james
r.
young
right.
mr.
james
r.
young
yes.
yes,
there
was
an
allegation
that
there
was
a
conspiracy
between
those
two.
the
allegation
in
the
trial
court...
i
think
this
is
clear
from
the
complaint,
the
amended
complaint,
paragraphs
100
and
104.
i'm
sorry.
let
me
get
directly
to
the
point.
the
point
is
that
the
allegation
below
was
that
there
was
a
conspiracy
to
make
nynex
the
monopolist
in
that
market.
now,
the
reason
that
is
faulty,
the
reason
that
doesn't
even
meet
the
conspiracy
test,
is
that
nynex
was
not
in
the
removal
services
market
and
had
no
intent
to
be.
mr.
james
r.
young
i
think
the
complaint
is
fairly
read,
and
now
i
refer
to
paragraphs
100
and
104
of
the
amended
complaint,
where
the
allegation
is
that
the
power
over
price
was
to
be
in
nynex's
hands,
and
also
if
you
look
at
the
briefs
they're
filed
in
the
court
of
appeals.
i
think
it's
clear
that
what
they
were
alleging
below...
it's
not
the
theory
that
the
second
circuit
went
off
on,
but
their
theory
below
was
that
it
was
nynex
to
be
the
monopolist,
and
that's
why
there's
a
fundamental
problem
in
that
theory,
because
nynex
wasn't
even
in
the
business.
that's
what
i
meant...
this
is
one
of
the
things
i
meant
when
i
was
referring
to
sort
of
the
moving
target
that
this
case
has
been
as
it
moved
through
the...
moved
through
the...
mr.
james
r.
young
that's
paragraph
100
and
104.
mr.
james
r.
young
well,
the...
one
thing,
though,
i
think
is
clear,
and
that
is,
we
have
the
final
theory
before
us.
we
have
the
allegations
of
the
complaint
before
us,
the
allegations
have
the
problem
that
i
think
i've
described,
so
this
is
a
case
that
is
very
appropriate
for
dismissal,
just
as
so
many
of
the
lower
courts
have
dealt
with
antitrust
claims
that
really
don't
allege
harm
to
market-wide...
mr.
james
r.
young
i
guess
i'd
answer
that
question
this
way.
it
is
certainly
true
that
harm
to
market-wide
competition
is
not
adequately
alleged.
it
is
very
difficult
for
me
to
see
how
it
could
have
been
adequately
alleged
in
this
kind
of
a
business
precisely
because
there
are
no
barriers
to
entry.
that's
not
to
say
that
there...
a
plaintiff
with
a
well-pleaded
complaint
might
not
have
another
cause
of
action.
there
might
have
been
a
breach
of
contract
action,
or
a
fraud,
or
a
tortious
interference.
there
could
be
other
legal
remedies
for
someone
in
discon's
position,
but
antitrust
law
is
really
the
wrong
legal
lens
to
look
at
this
problem
through.
mr.
james
r.
young
no,
i
don't
believe
so,
because
the
question
presented
did
not
use
the
words
per
se,
it
said,
group
boycott.
the
second
circuit,
when
it
used
that
phrase,
encompassed
both...
included
both
alternatives,
either
a
rule
of
reason
or
a
per
se
analysis,
so
i
think
the
rule
of
reason
analysis
is
fairly
included
in
the
question
presented
and,
as
i
said
before,
i
think
this
court
has
everything
before
it
that
it
needs
to
resolve
the
case.
the
principles
here
i
think
are
relatively
straightforward.
there
is
no
further
need,
i
would
respectfully
suggest,
for
further...
mr.
james
r.
young
yes.
mr.
james
r.
young
the...
justice
stevens,
i
think
the
right
answer
to
that
question
is,
as
long
as
what
we're
talking
about
is
a
vertical
nonprice
agreement,
then
the
appropriate
analysis
is
the
rule
of
reason
analysis,
and
it
is...
as
long
as
there
genuinely
are
no
barriers
to
entry,
it
may
well
be
that
the
allegation
is
that
people
have
acted
for
a
bad
reason
in
terminating
the
supplier,
but
that's
not...
mr.
james
r.
young
because...
mr.
james
r.
young
because
the
relevant
question
is,
what
is
the
state
of
rivalry
in
the
market,
not
whether
a
particular
supplier
goes
out
of
business.
mr.
james
r.
young
the
best
authorities
that
i
would
point
to...
i
could
not
point
to
any
authority
of
this
court.
there
are
several
lower
court
opinions.
there's
a
judge
posner
decision
that's
cited
in
the
briefs.
there's
the
blue
cross
marshfield
decision,
and
there's
a
first
circuit
decision
that
justice
breyer
wrote
when
he
was
on
the
first
circuit
that
explains
the
same
point.
i
think
that's
the
case
with
the
unlikely
plaintiff's
name
of
kartell.
[laughter]
mr.
james
r.
young
but
those
two
cases...
i'm
sure
that
there
are
others,
but
those
two
cases
have
a
particularly
good
explanation
of
why
it
is
that
a
monopolist
who
raises
his
rates
is,
that
is
not
an
antitrust
problem.
it
is,
in
fact,
as
judge
posner
explains...
mr.
james
r.
young
regulated
monopolist,
excuse
me,
yes,
why
that
is
not
an
antitrust
problem.
let
me
just
talk...
mr.
james
r.
young
well,
i
think
this
court
in
northwest
stationers
certainly
suggested
that
there
could
be
group
boycotts
that
are
not
analyzed
under
a
per
se
approach,
but
in
terms
of
the
question
presented,
plainly
the
second
circuit
indicated
meant
group
boycott
to
subsume
both
per
se
and
rule
of
reason.
mr.
james
r.
young
because...
two
reasons.
first,
the
court
has
everything
in
front
of
it
it
needs
to
dispose
of
the
case.
it
has
the
theory...
mr.
james
r.
young
the
second
reason,
which
i
think
is
probably
the
most...
mr.
james
r.
young
important
is...
[laughter]
it
inevitably
is.
the
second
reason
is
that
if
this
court
sends
this
back
it
is
implicitly
saying,
i
think,
that
this
complaint
was
good
enough,
as
we've
indicated
in
the
briefs.
the
lower
courts
have
developed
quite
a
practice
in
dealing
with
these
disappointed
supplier
cases.
the
12(b)(6)
motion
is
used,
and
one
difficulty
about
remanding
this
case
is,
i
think
it
would
tend
to
undercut
that,
and...
mr.
james
r.
young
if
i
might...
mr.
james
r.
young
one
more...
if
i
could
say
one
more
thing
before
i
close,
i
haven't
really
talked
about
the
section
2
conspiracy
claim
at
any
great
length.
i
think
this
is
covered
in
the
briefs.
the
basic
point
is,
if
there's
no
rule
of
reason
claim
there
can
be
no
conspiracy
claim.
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
james
r.
young
mr.
chief
justice,
i
don't
want
to
impose
on
the
court.
i
think
i've
made
the
points
i...
mr.
james
r.
young
certainly.
[laughter]
mr.
james
r.
young
at...
mr.
james
r.
young
i
believe
that's
correct.
mr.
james
r.
young
at
one
point
i
think
when
he
was
talking
about
purchasers
he
referred
to
at&t
communications
as
a
purchaser...
mr.
james
r.
young
that's
correct.
mr.
james
r.
young
there
are
actually,
i
think,
two
markets
alleged.
one
is
a
new
york
state-wide
market,
and
one
is
new
york
telephone
market,
but
again,
