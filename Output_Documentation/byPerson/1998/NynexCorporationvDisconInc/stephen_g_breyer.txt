justice
stephen
g.
breyer
sorry,
i
thought
he
didn't.
i
thought...
i'm
mixed
up,
perhaps,
but
i
thought
that
if
we
call...
let's
call
nytel
that
whole
series
of
buyers,
and
we'll
call
at&t
tech
the
seller.
i
thought
they
did
pay
a
competitive
price.
they
paid
a
low
price
disguised
as
a
high
price,
so
they
not
only
got
the
low
price,
they
got
an
extra
term,
the
extra
term
was
called,
the
term
to
help
you
chisel.
so
they
paid
some
money,
which
was
cheap,
and
that
money,
plus
the
extra
benefit,
the
help
you
chisel
term.
there's
no
reason
to
think
that's
any
lower,
or
higher,
no
higher
than
discon's
price,
is
it...
is
it?
they
paid
a
competitive
price.
it
just
happened
they
paid
about
the
same
amount
of
money,
and
they
also
got
a
little
kick
in
there.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
there's
no
doubt
about
that,
is
there?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
right,
a
little
higher...
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
there's
no
doubt
about
that,
but
there's
also
no
doubt,
i
take
it,
that
the
consumer
paid
more.
i
mean,
they
went
and
chiseled,
according
to
the
complaint,
all
right,
so...
and
were
they
exercising
monopoly
power?
of
course.
so
i
mean
i
don't
see
there's
any...
your...
nytel,
certainly
exercising
monopoly
power.
that's
how
it
was
able
to
charge
a
higher
price
to
the
consumer,
because
it's
a
monopoly,
all
right,
so...
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
go
ahead.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
all
right,
assume...
i'm
having
trouble
understanding,
and
the
part
i
don't
understand
is,
i'll
assume
any
facts
you
want.
now,
how
could
it
be
a
violation
of
the
antitrust
law?
that
is
to
say,
i'm
not
saying
it
is
or
isn't.
i
am
a
buyer.
i
buy
from
a.
when
i
buy
from
a,
i
haven't
bought
from
b.
i'll
assume
there
are
only
two
firms,
a
and
b,
so
if
i
buy
everything
from
a,
i've
bought
nothing
from
b.
goodbye
b.
now,
suppose
that
i
have
a
terrible
motive,
like
trying
to
chisel
consumers.
that's
what
they're
saying
here.
all
right.
now,
either
they
win
on
that
terrible
motive,
or
they
lose.
suppose
they
lose,
because
that's
a
regulatory
problem,
not
an
antitrust
problem.
at
that
point,
what
facts
could
make
out
a
rule
of
reason
antitrust
case?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
no,
those
are
conclusions.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'm
asking
you
about
facts.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
a
conclusion,
a
legal
conclusion.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
want
to
know
what
facts
there
are
that,
if
we
assume
this
motive,
is
a
regulatory
problem
and
not
an
antitrust
problem,
and
if
we
assume
giant
entry
barriers,
only
two
firms...
as
tall
as
the
empire
state
building
those
entry
barriers.
now,
assume
all
that,
and
tell
me
what
are
the
facts
that
would
then
make
out
a
violation
of
either
section
1
or
section
2.
facts,
not
legal
conclusions.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
does
that
mean
something
other
than
what
i
said
i
would
assume...
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that
what
they
did...
i
assume
they
bought
from
a
for
this
bad
reason.
now,
have
you
added
anything
to
that,
my
assumption,
in
what
you
just
said?
i'm
willing
to
assume
that
they
bought
from
a,
never
bought
from
b...
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
they
did
it
for
this
bad
reason,
to
chisel
the
consumer.
now,
once
i've
assumed
that,
have
you
added
a
fact
to
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
if
so,
what?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
can
i
ask
you
the
same
question
that
i
asked
the
solicitor
general?
if
through
some
miracle
you
remember
it,
i
won't
repeat
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
right.
i'm
not
doubting
for
present
purposes
your
client
should
have
a
remedy.
i
mean,
the
only
issue,
i
think,
is
whether
it's
an
antitrust
remedy
or
a
regulatory
remedy,
so
assume
that.
also,
i'm
not
going
to
doubt
for
present
purposes
that
you
have
a
big
buyer...
you
know,
put
them
all
together
all
three
of
them.
i'm
counting
them
as
one
buyer,
and
we
have
two
sellers,
a
and
b.
you're
b.
a
is
at&t,
all
right.
and
i'm
also
not
doubting
that
what
happened
is,
the
buyer
went
to
the
seller,
your
competitor,
and
said,
i'm
going
to
buy
at
a
low
price
disguised
as
a
high
price,
for
terrible
reasons,
to
hurt
the
consumer.
i'm
assuming
all
that.
as
a
result,
your
client
lost
the
business,
all
right.
i've
got
those
facts.
i'm
assuming
all
that
in
your
favor.
i'm
assuming
that
your
client's
never
going
to
get
the
business
unless
you
can
complain
to
the
regulator
and
get
this
set
aside.
now,
is
there...
i
can
understand
the
legal
issue.
we
have
to
characterize
this
bad
reason
as,
is
it
a
regulatory
problem
or
an
antitrust
problem?
any
additional
fact,
is
there
any
additional
fact
that
you
want
to
show,
other
than
what
i
just
summarized,
because
if
not,
i
guess
we
could
decide,
yes
or
no,
but
if
so,
what
are
they?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
additional
facts,
and
as
far
as
entry
barriers
are
concerned,
i'll
assume
whatever
entry
barriers
you
want,
whatever
you
think
you
plausibly
can
prove
as
to
lack
thereof,
or
not
lack
thereof.
is
there
any
additional
fact?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
evil
motive...
now...
in
other
words,
there
is
a
human
being
called
a
manager,
and
we're
looking
into
his
mind,
and
i
can
see
that
that
manager
might
want
to
cheat
the
consumer,
on
your
theory,
i've
got
that
one,
by
raising
the
price
above
what
he
really
paid
when
he
tells
the
regulator.
now,
is
there
some
additional
factual
set
of
things
floating
around
in
that
person's
brain?
what?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
mm-hmm.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
i've
got
that.
haven't
i
assumed
that?
i've
assumed
that
what
happened
was
that
the
buyers
went
to
your
competitor
and
said,
charge
us
a
high
price,
heh,
heh,
give
us
a
rebate,
heh,
heh,
that
way
we
will,
in
fact,
cheat
the
consumer.
i'm
assuming
all
that
in
your
favor,
and
what
i'm
looking
for
is
some
additional
fact.
is
there
some
additional
fact
in
this
case
that
you
would
like
to
try
to
prove,
because
i
can
deal
with
the
legal
issue
as
the
facts
as
i
assume
them.
i
decide
one
way
or
the
other.
but
what
i'm
looking
for
is,
are
there
some
additional
facts
that
you
might
prove
which,
i
don't
know
what
they
are.
that's
why
i'm
asking
the
question.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
are
you
going...
what
do
you
intend
to
show,
any,
again,
facts...
i'm
back
to
facts.
what
do
you
intend
to
show,
if
you
want
to...
you're
going
to
show
that
the
buyer
bought
only
from
the
seller,
who
had
imposed
this
unfair
condition.
i
understand
you're
going
to
show
that.
once
you've
shown
that,
what
do
you
intend
to
show
extra
to
demonstrate
what
justice
scalia
just
said?
i
mean,
does
your
claim
that,
well,
really
what
the
buyer
was
doing
here
is,
it
wanted
to
exclude
all
the
other
competitors
of
the
sellers.
does
that
come
down
to
a
claim
that,
yes,
he
just
bought
from
a
all
the
time?
is
there
something
extra?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
what
do...
i
mean,
do
you
have
any
fact
at
all
that's
going
to
show
that,
other
than
the
fact
that
what
the
buyer
did
was
always
buy
from
a?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what,
for
example?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
like
what?
