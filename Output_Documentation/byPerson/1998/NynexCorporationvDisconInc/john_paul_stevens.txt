justice
john
paul
stevens
but
may
i
just
interrupt
with,
what
about
the
costs
of
removal
services?
what
if
the
alleged
conspiracy,
which
may
or
may
not
have
existed,
result
in
higher
costs
of
removal
services?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
don't
they
allege
that
they
did,
that
technologies
bid
$998,000,
and
the
plaintiff
was
bidding
about
half
that
amount
any
they
mark
it
up
to
amounts
still
less
than...
justice
john
paul
stevens
haven't
they
alleged
that
the
costs
of
removal
services
were
artificially
enhanced?
justice
john
paul
stevens
oh,
but
why
doesn't
it,
if
that's
a
main
purchaser
in
the
market,
and
if
the
people
who
made
the
agreement...
the
whole
thing
is
kind
of
strange,
but
anyway,
if
the
people
who
made
the
agreement
had
for
its
purpose
higher
prices
for
removal
services,
why
does
it
matter
that
they
were
willing
to
pay
the
higher
prices?
justice
john
paul
stevens
because
those
prices
then,
as
justice
kennedy
pointed
out,
are
passed
on
to
the
ultimate
consumer
of
telephone
services.
justice
john
paul
stevens
actually,
as
i
understand
it
there's...
there
were
two
purchasers,
the
exchange
sub
of
at&t
as
well
as
the
nynex
sub,
and
the
allegation
is,
they
agreed
to
create
a
monopoly
in
the
purchase
of
removal
services.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
no,
between
the
nynex
meco,
or
whatever
it
is...
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
the
at&t
subsidiary
that
consumed
removal
services
in
its
exchange
business,
in
the...
justice
john
paul
stevens
isn't
the
complaint
fairly
read
as
indicated,
they
wanted
at&t
technologies
to
have
all
the
removal
business?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
paragraph
again
is
that,
just
so
i
know?
justice
john
paul
stevens
okay,
thank
you.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
this
question,
mr.
young.
you
place
great
emphasis
on
the
fact
there
are
no
barriers
to
entry...
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
the
market
and,
assuming
that's
correct,
is
it
your
position
that
even
if
the
people
in
the
business
do
engage
in
a
conspiracy
to
exclude
somebody
entirely
and
drive
them
out
of
business
for
all
sorts
of
improper
purposes,
that
could
never
be
an
antitrust
violation
as
long
as
there
are
no
barriers
to
entry,
because
always
somebody
will
come
back
later
because
they
can't
succeed?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
the
bad
reason
in
this
case
is,
to
exclude
this
company
from
the
market
permanently
and
entirely
no
matter
what
it
takes,
that's
perfectly
all
right,
because
other
people
can
always
get
back
in
and
replace
them?
justice
john
paul
stevens
that
would
never
be
an
antitrust
violation.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
brown,
may
i
ask
a
rather
fundamental
question
that
cuts
across
the
whole
case?
you
say,
from
that
market.
justice
john
paul
stevens
now,
it
seems
to
me
there
are
at
least
two
different
ways
one
might
describe
that
market,
and
i
want
to
know
which
one
you
say.
as
your
opponent
said,
at
104
you
say
the
market
is
purchases
by
nynex.
that's
one
way
to
define
it.
there
also,
however,
are
two
other
purchasers
of
removal
services
in
new
york.
there's
at&tc,
which
you
describe
in
paragraph
26,
and
there's
also
the
buffalo,
or
rochester
telephone
company.
now,
are
rochester
and
at&tc
in
or
out
of
the
market
you
say
was
monopolized?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
you
do
not
contend
that
the...
that
the
market
which
included
rochester
telephone
was
monopolized
or
restrained?
you're
not
saying
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
how
do
you
read
it?
you're
the
author
of
the
complaint.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
understand
that,
and
i'm
asking
you
how
do
you
define
the
market?
what
is
the
market?
does
it
include
or
does
it
not
include
rochester
telephone?
justice
john
paul
stevens
does
it
include
or
not
include
at&tc?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it's
the
interexchange
network
in
the
state
for
at&t.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
they
use
removal
services,
too.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
it
does
not
include
that
entity,
either.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
the
market
we're
talking
about
is
the
single
purchaser
of
nynex.
justice
john
paul
stevens
okay.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
seems
to
me
it's
a
strange...
justice
john
paul
stevens
could
you
explain
one
allegation?
a
couple
of
places
in
the
complaint
you
say
they
had
threatened
to
discredit
discon
with
the
regulatory
agencies.
i
don't
quite
understand
that,
because
i
didn't
understand
that
you
were
subject
to
regulation.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
it
wouldn't
impose
on
the
court
if
you
answered
one
question
for
me.
justice
john
paul
stevens
when
your
opponent
kept
referring
to
at&t
communications,
was
he
really
referring
to
at&t
technologies?
i
get
a
little
mixed
up
with
the
subsidiaries
here.
justice
john
paul
stevens
at&t
technologies
is
the
one,
the
at&t
sub,
that
was
the...
that
actually
provided
the
removal
services,
was
it
not?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
so
when
he
said
communications
he
meant
technologies.
justice
john
paul
stevens
that
would
have
been
this
at&tc
that
i
was
referring
to
earlier.
justice
john
paul
stevens
right.
do
you
also
read
the
complaint
the
way
he
does,
just...
i
guess
you
do,
because
you
pointed
out
that
paragraph
of
the
complaint.
the
only
market
we're
concerned
about
is
the
market,
purchases
by
new
york
telephone.
justice
john
paul
stevens
right.
