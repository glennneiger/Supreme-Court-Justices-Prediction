justice
antonin
scalia
it's
a
different
product
they
were
selling.
they
were
making
an
extraordinary
offer.
justice
antonin
scalia
they're
selling
a
different
product,
so
the
price
could
be
higher.
justice
antonin
scalia
they're
selling
removal
services
plus
a
kickback,
so
the
price
for
the
removal
service
is
quite
low.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
might
have
been
the
best
price
in
the
market,
actually.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
about
the
purchase
of
removal
services,
as
opposed
to
the
sale
of
removal
services?
does...
was
there
monopoly
power
there?
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
alleging
a
conspiracy
between
the
provider
and
the
purchaser,
right,
and...
justice
antonin
scalia
when
such
a
conspiracy
is
alleged,
wouldn't
the
monopoly
power
on
the
part
of
the
purchaser
be
relevant?
justice
antonin
scalia
could
i
ask...
i
frankly
tend
to
agree
with
you
about
what
result
you
get
when
you
apply
the
rule
of
reason,
but
i'm
not
sure
that...
i
certainly
didn't
understand
when
i
voted
to
grant
the
petition
that
we
were
talking
about
anything
except
a
group
boycott
in
violation
of
section
1,
and
that's
a
term
of
art,
and
the
term
of
art
means
the
kind
of
thing
that
is
a
per
se
violation.
have
you
ever
heard
of
a
group
boycott
that...
would
you
have
to
call
it
a
group
boycott
in
order
to
use
the
rule
of
reason?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
we
wouldn't
be
saying
the
complaint
is
good
enough.
we
would
be
saying
the
issue
of
whether
the
complaint
is
good
enough
on
this
other
theory
was
not
before
us.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
that's
what
we
would
be
saying
if
we
sent
it
back.
now,
maybe
we
shouldn't
say
that,
but...
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
that's
true
when
you
have
identified
a
restraint
on
competition.
you
ask
yourself,
you
know,
is
it
worth
the
benefits
on
the
other
side.
but
what
is
the
restraint
on
competition
here?
the
argument
being
made
is
that
there
is
no
restraint
on
competition,
period,
that
any
time
nynex
itself
wanted
to
terminate
this
sweetheart
deal
it
could,
and
it
would
have
in
front
of
it
a
totally
competitive
industry,
because
it
takes
nothing
to
get
into
it.
it's
like
demolition.
as
i
understand
it,
some
telephone
companies
don't
even
use
outside
people
to
do
it.
they
use
their
employees.
they
say,
come
on,
rip
out
this
switchboard.
we
don't
need
it
any
more.
justice
antonin
scalia
without
selling
to
nynex.
i
mean,
you
could
not
sell
to
nynex
without
getting
the
approval
of
nynex's
purchasing
agent.
justice
antonin
scalia
which
is
nynex.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
is
this
case
any
different...
let
me
put
it
another
way.
is
it
your
position
that
you
can
avoid
a
motion
for
summary
judgment
whenever
you
allege
a
sole
purchaser...
i'm
the
only
purchaser
in
the
industry
of
widgets.
nobody
else
uses
widgets,
and
i
enter
into
a
requirements
contract
with
one
seller.
i
totally
eliminate
all
other
competitors
selling
widgets.
now,
is
that
enough
for
you
to
allege?
justice
antonin
scalia
why
have
you
gone
beyond
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
i'll
change
my
hypothetical,
then.
there
used
to
be
three
people
selling
to
this
sole
purchaser
of
widgets.
i'm
the
only
company
in
the
country
that
purchases
widgets.
i
used
to
buy
it
from
three
people.
i
decide
i
am
going
to
enter
into
a
requirements
contract
with
one
of
these
three,
which
means
that
i
won't
be
buying
from
the
other
two.
is
that...
does
that
allege
an
antitrust
violation?
justice
antonin
scalia
now,
what
have
you
added
to
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
i'll
add
to
my
hypothetical
that
the
reason
we
entered
into
the
requirements
contract
with
this
one
supplier
is
that
that
supplier
is
owned
by
my
son-in-law,
okay.
i
don't
consider
that
a
terribly
good
competitive
justification,
right?
would
that
make
it
an
antitrust
violation?
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
it's
not
unilateral.
i
mean,
you
can't
make
a
requirement...
it
takes
two
to
make
a
contract.
i
mean,
i
enter
the
requirements
contract
with
the
supplier.
i
conspired
with
the
supplier
to
make
a
requirements
contract.
you
know,
i
said,
what
if
i
bought
all
my
requirements
from
you,
and
he
said,
yes,
that's
a
good
idea.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
i
have.
i'm
eliminating
everybody
else
from
the
widget-selling
industry.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
how
have
i
effected
a...
i
mean,
i
haven't
harmed...
that
may
give
you
a
cause
of
action
against
me,
where
you
add
to
my
hypothetical
not
just
that
i
want
to
help
my
son-in-law,
but
i...
these
other
two
companies
that
i'm
driving
out
are
owned
by
enemies
of
mine,
and
i
really
want
to
hurt
them.
i
guess
there's
a
cause
of
action
for,
i
don't
know,
malicious
interference
with
business
relationships
or
something
like
that,
but
in
order
for
it
to
be
an
antitrust
cause
of
action
you
have
to
show
that
there
has
been
harm
to
competitiveness
within
that
industry.
how
is
there
any
harm
to
competitiveness?
justice
antonin
scalia
as
soon
as
my
son-in-law
leaves
that
company,
i
can
immediately
open
it
up
for
bids
and
people
will
come
in
and,
since
there
are
no
entry
barriers
to
this
particular
industry,
i
can
ask
for
as
low
a
price
as
i
want.
justice
antonin
scalia
that
was
my
question.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
reason...
but
the
reason
the
consumers
are
subject
to
the
whims
of
a
monopolist
is
not
anything
that's
been
done
in
this
contract.
they're
subject
to
monopoly
power
because
the
state
has
made
them
subject
to
monopoly
power
by
awarding
monopoly
to
the
provider
of
telephone
services.
how
can
you
blame
the
fact
that
they're
harmed
by
monopoly
power
upon
this
deal?
this
deal
hasn't
created
that
monopoly
power.
it's
a
creation
of
the
state.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
i
thought
the
purpose
of
the
antitrust
laws
was
to
stop
individuals
from
creating
monopoly
power,
and
the
monopoly
power
that
is
hurting
these
consumers
is
not
a
creation
of
this
deal,
it's
a
creation
of
the
state.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
there
are
regulatory...
i
mean,
in
awarding
monopoly
the
state
also
supervises
it,
so
there
are
punishments
that
can
be
meted
out
by
the
appropriate
regulatory
authority,
but
i
find
it
hard
to
see
how
you
can
blame
that
monopoly
power
upon
this
transaction.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
brown,
may
i
suggest
something
that
maybe
you
are
adding
to
the
hypothetical
that
justice
stevens...
that
justice
breyer
proposes?
it
seems
to
me
it
is
a
part
of
your
case
that
not
only
was
there
this
scam
in
which
i
was
going
to
give
all
of
my
business
to
you
and
get
a
kick-back,
but
you
allege
it
was
an
essential
part
of
the
scam
that
everybody
else
be
driven
out
of
the
industry.
justice
antonin
scalia
if
you
are
unsuccessful
in
driving
everybody
else
out,
the
scam
would
be
disclosed.
it
would
be
apparent
that
you're
paying
much
more
to
the
person
that's
giving
you
the
kick-back
than
you
have
to
pay
for
these
services.
i
guess
that's
an
additional
allegation
that
you
make
here.
