we'll
hear
argument
now
in
number
96-1570,
nynex
corporation
v.
discon,
inc....
mr.
young.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
cases
that
come
up
on
a
motion
to
dismiss
are
more
apt
to
be
moving
targets
than
if
you'd
gone
through
and
litigated
the
thing
and
there
was
some
sort
of
a
factual
record,
i
think.
that
may
not
be
your
fault.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
young.
mr.
wallace,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
wallace.
mr.
brown,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that
was
quite
a
different
fact
situation,
was
it
not,
mr.
brown?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
mean,
could
you
answer
the
question?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
don't
you
think
that
was
quite
different,
with
a
number
of
different
parties
involved?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
you
need
a
group
to
make
a
group
boycott,
don't
you?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
meco
is
really
an
agent
for
nynex,
was
it
not?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
is
that
any
different
from
saying
that
nynex's
purchasing
agent
had
to
approve
every
vendor?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
your
client
can
certainly...
but
nynex
can
certainly
be
punished
by
the
regulatory
authority,
can
it
not?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
no,
but
for
passing
on
these
phony
prices
to
consumers,
certainly
the
new
york
regulatory
authority
could
get
after
it.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
is
that
any
different
from
the
hypothesis
of
a
requirements
contract?
it
has
the
same
effect
on
your
client,
whether
we
say...
whether
nynex
says,
i'm
going
to
have
a
requirements
contract
and
buy
my
stuff
from
x,
or
if
they
say,
i
won't
have
you
bidding
any
more.
the
result
in
each
case
is,
you
get
nothing.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
i
asked
you,
what's
the
difference
between
a
requirements
contract
and
the
statement
to
your
client,
we
won't
even
have
you
bid?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
brown.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
young,
you
have
2
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
young.
the
case
is
submitted.
