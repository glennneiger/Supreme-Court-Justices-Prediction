mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
courts
have
not
had
experience
with
the
kind
of
antitrust
claim
alleged
in
this
case.
it
involves
a
regulatory
evasion
scheme
to
harm
consumers
by
recovering
inflated
costs
under
a
rate
regulation
system
allowing
recovery
of
costs
by
the
regulated
utility,
the
kind
of
system
of
rate
regulation
now
rapidly
being
superseded
by
competitive
deregulation
or
by
systems
of
rate
regulation
such
as
price
caps
that
are
designed
to
provide
greater
incentives
for
efficiency
on
the
part
of
the
regulated
utility.
and
the
allegation
is
of
a
conspiracy
not
just,
for
example,
with
an
accountant
to
cook
the
books
of
the
regulated
utility,
but
with
a
supplier
in
an
unregulated,
what
the
antitrust
lawyers
call
upstream
market,
the
market
for
these
removal
services,
and
the
conspiracy
alleged
is
to
monopolize
that
market
and
to
exclude
a
competitor
of
that
supplier
of
removal
services
from
that
unregulated
market
because
competition
in
that
market
would
threaten
the
success
of
the
scheme
that
allegedly
involves
inflated
payments
to
that
supplier,
followed
by
secret
rebates.
now,
we
agree
with
petitioners
that
this
is
not
properly
regarded
as
a
per
se...
an
allegation
of
a
per
se
violation
of
the
antitrust
laws,
for
reasons
explained
in
our
brief.
basically,
we
think
the
court
of
appeals
got
off
track
on
that
particular
point
by
not
recognizing
that
it
has
to
be
a
type
of
restraint
that
almost
always
tends
to
restrict
competition
and
reduce
output,
rather
than
that
on
the
facts
of
a
particular
case
it
might
be
shown
that
the
restraint
has
only
anticompetitive
effects.
so
we
agree
that
it's
a
case
for
rule
of
reason
analysis
under
section
1,
but
we
do
think
that
petitioner's
argument
in,
particularly
in
their
brief,
is
too
facile
in
trying
to
make
almost
a
virtue
for
purposes
of
this
case
out
of
the
regulatory
evasion
allegations.
they
say
that
these
allegations
sufficiently
show
the
motive,
a
motive
for
the
conduct
that's
alleged,
but
that
the
effects
on
consumers
in
the
utility's
own
market
for
telephone
services
have
to
be
ignored
entirely
because
the
restraint
alleged
is
in
this
upstream
market
for
removal
services.
but
the
very
authority
they
cite,
correctly,
describing
the
rule
of
reason,
this
court's
decision
in
business
electronics
v.
sharp
electronics,
quoting
its
decision
in
gte
sylvania,
says
that
under
the
rule
of
reason...
and
this
is
the
quote
from
both
cases...
the
factfinder
weighs
all
the
circumstances
of
a
case
in
deciding
whether
a
restrictive
practice
should
be
prohibited
as
imposing
an
unreasonable
restraint
on
competition.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
this
argument
may
turn
out
to
be
one
that
could
be
substantiated
even
in
summary
judgment
proceedings
factually,
but
it
seems
to
me
to
rest
on
drawing
too
much
out
of
some
passing
references
in
some
of
the
allegations
of
the
complaint...
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
at
this
stage
of
the
case.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
we
certainly
would
file
a
complaint,
i
hope,
that
would
be
clearer
in
its
theories
of
what
the
violation
is.
the
second
circuit
has
read
the
complaint
generously,
although
we
think
that
is
not
improper
at
the
motion
to
dismiss
stage,
the
logic
of
the
complaint,
putting
the
regulatory
evasion
scheme
together
with
the
allegations
of
an
attempt
to
achieve
monopoly
power
logically
from
the
complaint
to
mask
those
regulatory
evasions,
because
the
existence
of
competition
by
a
participant
such
as
discon
would
threaten
to
unmask
it.
it...
i
mean,
the
petitioners
like
to
say
that
this
is
just
an
allegation
of
harm
to
a
competitor,
but
it
was
the
fact
of
the
competition
in
that
market
that
was
the
threat
to
the
scheme.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
in...
i
think
under
these
allegations
the
facts
that
could
make
it
out
would
be
that
they
could
substantiate
that
this
was
a
conspiracy
to
monopolize
that
market...
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
and
show
some...
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
mm-hmm.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
yes.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
the
facts
are
that,
as
alleged,
that
they
discriminated
against
this
participant
in
the
market
in
order
to
exclude
him
from
the
market
even
when
he
was
offering
fully
adequate
competitive
services
at
a
more
favorable
price,
and
that
there
were
no
legitimate
business
reasons
for
the
decision,
but
it
was
designed
to
mask
the
regulatory
violation.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
other
than
just...
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
but...
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that...
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
they...
it's
also
alleged
that
they
conspired
together
to
take
steps
to
see
to
it
that
the
plaintiff
here,
the
respondent,
was
excluded
from
that
market
because
of
the
threat
that
his
competitive
offers
would
unmask
the
conspiracy,
the
regulatory
evasion
conspiracy.
the
point
i
want
to
make
is
that
once
the
domain
of
the
antitrust
laws
has
been
entered
because
a
restraint
has
been
alleged
in
the
unregulated,
upstream
market,
it
seems
to
us
that
the
purpose
and
effect
of
the
alleged
restraint
should
be
looked
at
in
total,
just
as
the
purpose
and
effect
occurs
in
the
real
world,
and
that
includes
the
effect
on
consumers
in
the
utilities
market.
