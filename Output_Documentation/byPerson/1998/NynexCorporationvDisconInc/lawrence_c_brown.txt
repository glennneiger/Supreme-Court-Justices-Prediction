mr.
lawrence
c.
brown
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
we're
here
in
a
situation
that
is
like
the
klor's
case.
this
is
a
12(b)(6)
motion.
in
klor's
there
was
an
application
for
summary
judgment.
in
klor's,
absolutely
no
procompetitive
justification
was
given
in
a
group
boycott
context
by
the
defendants.
rather,
they
said
they
had
the
right
to
contract
with
whoever
they
pleased...
mr.
lawrence
c.
brown
well,
mr.
chief
justice,
as
i
understand
klor's...
mr.
lawrence
c.
brown
yes.
mr.
lawrence
c.
brown
i
think
that
is
true,
your
honor,
in
terms
of
the
number
of
parties
involved,
but
in
terms
of
the
structure,
the
violation
that
was
being
addressed,
i
don't
believe
it
differs.
mr.
lawrence
c.
brown
well,
your
honor,
as
i
read
northwest
stationers,
in
terms
of
its
description
of
what
a
per
se
approach
generally
involving,
a
joint
effort
by
a
firm
or
firms
to
disadvantage
a
competitor
of
one
of
the
participants
in
the
boycott
to
keep
them
from
access
to
a
market,
or
from
certain
critical
components
that
they
need
to
compete.
in
the
present
case,
your
honor,
we
have
a
situation
where,
at
the
time
of
the
at&t
breakup,
meco
is
created.
meco
is
a
gatekeeper,
your
honor.
we've
heard
about
entry
barriers
here
this
morning.
the
only
way
that
you
could
sell
nynex,
and
i
will
use
that
in
the
plural,
is
if
meco
approved
you
as
a
vendor.
mr.
lawrence
c.
brown
i
don't
disagree
with
that,
your
honor,
but
to
sell
to
new
york
telephone,
who
was
actually
the
ultimate
purchaser...
meco
was
just
a
reseller...
meco
had
to
approve
every
vendor
and
qualify
it.
mr.
lawrence
c.
brown
well,
your
honor,
i
don't
think
it
is
different.
i
don't
think
it
is
different,
but
it
has
to...
i'm
addressing
myself
to
barriers
to
entry.
in
terms
of
barriers
to
entry,
your
honor,
we're
dealing
with
a
situation
that
you
could
not
sell
to
nynex,
read
nytel...
mr.
lawrence
c.
brown
that's
true,
your
honor.
mr.
lawrence
c.
brown
and
in
this
case
we
did...
mr.
lawrence
c.
brown
no,
your
honor,
and
i
think
we've
gone
beyond
that.
mr.
lawrence
c.
brown
first
of
all,
your
honor,
discon,
my
client,
and
at&t
communications,
in
addition
to
some
minor
vendors
who
i
will
deal
with
if
your
honor
would
want
me
to,
were
approved
by
meco
to
sell
to
nytel.
we
were
both
selling
to
nytel.
the
analogy
to
an
exclusive...
mr.
lawrence
c.
brown
as
you
put
it,
your
honor,
no,
i
don't
think
it
does.
mr.
lawrence
c.
brown
all
right,
your
honor,
these
things.
my
client,
discon,
and
at&t
communications
were
supplying
services,
and
these
services
were
often
bid.
my
client
was
often
winning
these
bids.
at&t
communications,
not
the
parent,
would
speak
with
at&t
the
parent,
and
nynex
and
nytel,
draw
those
awarded
contracts
back.
that's
one
example.
a
second
example...
and
that,
your
honor,
would
be
ignoring
your
bidding
practices
and
taking
a
higher
price
with
absolutely
no
procompetitive
or
economic
justification.
there
has
never
been
an
issue
raised
as
the
quality
of
my
client's
services
or
its
ability
to
perform
and
deliver
for
the
price
bid.
mr.
lawrence
c.
brown
i
don't
think
that
would
make
it
an
antitrust
violation
if
that
was
the
sole,
unilateral
act,
your
honor,
but
if
we're
dealing
in
a
colgate
context,
and
we're
going
to
say...
mr.
lawrence
c.
brown
you
haven't
stated
a
conspiracy
to
do
anything
to
any
third
party
as
to
that
point
in
time,
your
honor.
mr.
lawrence
c.
brown
no,
you're
not,
your
honor,
not
within
the
context
of
the
antitrust
laws,
and
why
i
say
what
i
say
is,
and
why
i
use
the
term
unilateral,
if
you're
to
go
forward
without
any
intent
to
damage
a
competitor
of
the
person
with
whom
you're
dealing,
with
whom
you,
as
the
widget
purchaser,
is
dealing,
that's
one
thing.
but
if
you
enter
into
that
agreement,
your
honor,
with
the
intent
to
make
sure
that
that
competitor
or
the
person
you
deal
with
is
excluded
from
that
market
never
to
return,
and
by
that
you
have
effected
a
harm
on
competition
because
you
have
restriction
on
output,
you
have
restriction
on
price...
mr.
lawrence
c.
brown
all
right,
your
honor...
mr.
lawrence
c.
brown
your
honor,
my
response
to
that
would
be
twofold.
first,
the
conduct
in
this
particular
case
concerned
the
manner
in
which
a
regulatory
evasion
was
effected.
that's
where
the
anticompetitive
harm
came.
in
the
supplier
market,
the
supplier
market
had
to
be
fixed
and
supercompetitive
prices
had
to
be
enabled
by
the
elimination
of
competition
in
the
supplier
market,
which
is
unregulated,
and
what
occurred
here,
your
honor,
was
a
series
of
events
which,
when
put
into
operation,
eliminated
my
client
from
that
market,
and
i
will
go
further
and
say
this.
mr.
lawrence
c.
brown
yes.
mr.
lawrence
c.
brown
the
answer
to
that,
your
honor,
is
very
simply,
is
that
rochester
telephone
is
not
characterizable
as
being
in
the
same
market
if
we
deal
with
sales
to
nynex.
this...
mr.
lawrence
c.
brown
i
am
saying
it
can
be
read,
your
honor,
at
both
levels.
mr.
lawrence
c.
brown
how
i
read
it,
your
honor,
is
that
this
is
an
attempt
to
monopolize
a
market
for
the
provision
of
removal
services...
mr.
lawrence
c.
brown
it
would
not
include
rochester
telephone.
mr.
lawrence
c.
brown
at&tc
is
atc
communications,
your
honor,
is
the...
mr.
lawrence
c.
brown
yes.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
lawrence
c.
brown
that's
right.
we
treated
that
as
a
separate
market
as
well.
mr.
lawrence
c.
brown
that's
correct.
they're
separately
regulated,
your
honor.
mr.
lawrence
c.
brown
yes.
mr.
lawrence
c.
brown
yes.
mr.
lawrence
c.
brown
your
honor,
if
the...
mr.
lawrence
c.
brown
if
the
purchaser's
a
monopsonist,
has
control...
your
honor,
i
think
that
that's
a
more
difficult
question.
the
market
power...
mr.
lawrence
c.
brown
i
misunderstood
you,
then,
justice
scalia.
i'm
sorry?
mr.
lawrence
c.
brown
yes.
well,
i
think
we
did
assume,
and
i
assumed
in
my
brief
in
this
court
we
were
dealing
with
a
monopsonist
for
the
purchase
of
services
in
that
market,
which
is
why
i
was
saying,
in
response
to
justice
stevens
when
he
asked,
that
i
was
eliminating
purchases
by
nynex
for
that
purpose,
because
it
would
be
the
monopsonist
in
that
market.
mr.
lawrence
c.
brown
that's
absolutely
correct,
your
honor.
that
was...
mr.
lawrence
c.
brown
i
believe
so,
your
honor,
because
the
purpose
there,
even
though
the
effect
may
be
on
ratepayers,
you
can
only
affect
that
purpose
by
eliminating
competition
in
the
supplier
services
market.
that
is
the
only
way
you
can
make
that
work
under
the
facts
of
this
case
as
we
pled
them.
mr.
lawrence
c.
brown
well,
your
honor,
that
brings
about
who
really
has
the
authority
as
between
the
antitrust
laws...
mr.
lawrence
c.
brown
that
monopoly
power,
my
response
would
be,
your
honor,
cannot
be
abused
in
this
case
unless
they
fix
the
supplier
markets
in
a
manner
violative
of
the
antitrust
laws.
mr.
lawrence
c.
brown
we're
not
attacking...
we're
not
attacking
the
purchaser
for
being
a
monopsonist.
we're
attacking
the
purchaser
for
being
engaged
in
activity
upstream
beyond
those
areas
in
which
he
can
operate
as
a
natural
monopolist
to
fix
and
destroy
competition
in
supplier
markets.
mr.
lawrence
c.
brown
no,
if
you
would,
please.
[laughter]
mr.
lawrence
c.
brown
all
right.
mr.
lawrence
c.
brown
i
think,
your
honor,
in
response,
there
are
probably
a
couple.
first
of
all,
there
was
just
not
a
change
of
suppliers
for
economic
purposes
at
all.
you've
assumed
evil
motives,
but
i
don't
know
if
you're
assuming
the
evil
motive
that
creates
an
antitrust
injury.
mr.
lawrence
c.
brown
right.
your
honor,
there
was
a
two-step
approach
in
this
case
which
is
specifically
pled
in
the
amended
complaint.
the
first
was
that
prices
would
be
charged
by
the
competitors
and
they
would
be
marked
up
by
the
manager,
as
you've
called
the
manager.
mr.
lawrence
c.
brown
however,
in
1985,
new
york
telephone
said,
we
can't
tolerate
these
markups
any
more.
you
better
find
another
way
to
go
about
this.
so
instead...
instead,
meco,
materials
enterprises,
the
manager,
if
you
will,
starts
to
mandate
that
the
competitors
come
in
with
supracompetitive
prices.
my
client
would
not
do
that.
my...
mr.
lawrence
c.
brown
right.
i
think,
your
honor,
the
one
thing...
the
things
i
would
like
to
prove
is,
first
of
all,
to
compete
in
this
market
i
will
not
have
to
exercise
those
efficiencies
that
would
ordinarily
be
exercised
for
me
to
compete
in
this
market
and
to
bid.
in
other
words,
competition
is
being
suppressed.
price
is
being
increased,
output
is
being
reduced,
you
cannot
enter
this
market
unless
you
enter
into
the
scheme.
now,
if
the
issue
we're
talking
about,
your
honor,
is
the
regulatory,
as
professor
areeda
calls
it,
the
regulatory
remedy
as
opposed
to
an
antitrust
remedy,
i
only
suggest
this,
that
when
the
public
service
commission
of
the
state
of
new
york
and
the
federal
regulators
kept
pressing
the
utilities
in
this
case
they
told
them...
they
told
them
to
take
the
procurement
inside
the
regulated
businesses,
and
i
say
that
because
the
regulators
were
acknowledging
that
they
could
not
regulate
the
supplier
market,
that
that's
within
the
realm
of
antitrust.
if
we're
talking
about
the
remedy
for
my
client
as
a
competitor,
the
public
service
commission,
your
honor,
and
the
fcc
cannot
give
my
client,
discon,
incorporated,
any
remedy
for
anticompetitive
injury
at
all.
mr.
lawrence
c.
brown
yes,
but
not
for
antitrust
violations.
not
for
suppression
of
competition
in
the
supplier
market,
your
honor.
mr.
lawrence
c.
brown
i
think
that's
accurate,
your
honor,
and
i
think
they
did
adjust
the
rate
basis,
and
they
fined
them,
and
so
did
the
federal
communications
commission,
but
that
again
doesn't
address
the
antitrust
issues
and,
in
fact,
in
this
industry
the
fcc
has
acknowledged
that
this
industry
in
terms
of
antitrust,
from
the
times
of
the
at&t
breakup
case
forward.
and
there
are
a
number
of
circuit
court
of
appeals
cases
on
this
acknowledging
that
the
existence
of
regulation
in
and
of
itself
is
not
an
excuse
for
not
applying
the
antitrust
laws,
because
the
regulation
does
not
address
antitrust
violations.
they're
dealing
with
natural
monopolists,
as
i
think
i
had
said
in
my
brief,
and
acknowledged
that
point.
mr.
lawrence
c.
brown
ultimately,
every...
mr.
lawrence
c.
brown
yes.
yes,
it
is,
your
honor.
mr.
lawrence
c.
brown
no,
your
honor,
what...
where
this
was
occurring
is,
my
client
was
an
intervenor
in
hearings
before
the
new
york
state
public
service
commission,
and
new
york
tells
internal
security...
and
there's
a
mention
of
it,
to
try
to
establish
that
my
client
was
involved
in
payment
of
certain
personnel
within
the
nynex
group
to
ensure
it
would
get
business.
how
that
ties
in
in
terms
of
the
allegation
is,
there
is
a
later
allegation
in
the
complaint,
your
honor,
that
later
meco
personnel
came
to
the
principal
of
my
client
and
said,
if
you
will
return
all
evidence
of
discrimination,
and
you
will
agree
to
cooperate
with
this
scam,
we'll
let
you
provide
services
again
to
nynex.
i
realize
they're
located
in
separate
parts
of
the
complaint,
but
that
is
more
a
function
of
chronology
in
time
than
it
is
a
lack
of
a
tie.
mr.
lawrence
c.
brown
yes.
the
purpose...
mr.
lawrence
c.
brown
the
purpose
is
to
buy
from
a
only
to
discipline
b.
mr.
lawrence
c.
brown
oh,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
lawrence
c.
brown
they're
pled
in
the
complaint?
mr.
lawrence
c.
brown
winning
on
bids
which
then,
when
at&t
communications
went
in
with
a
higher
bid,
it
would...
the
bid
would
be
retracted
and
awarded
to
at
communications
without
any
further
notice
to
my
client.
that's
only
one
example.
mr.
lawrence
c.
brown
they...
mr.
lawrence
c.
brown
your
honor,
i
believe
that's
another
additional
fact.
i
believe
it
would
show
that
they
did
not
intend
to
comply
with
their
own
bidding
procedures,
that
they
in
fact
were
acting
against
their
own
best
interest.
mr.
lawrence
c.
brown
well,
your
honor,
i
think...
i
think
i
can
answer
that
two
ways.
first
of
all,
the
reason
they
entered
into
the
agreements
with
at
communications
was
because
at
communications
would
assist
them
in
the
regulatory
evasion
scheme
in
the
administratively
controlled
area,
the
natural
monopoly.
they
could
pass
through
the
cost
and
damage
consumers
by
controlling
the
unregulated
supplier
market.
that
was
the
motive
for
entering
into
that
exclusive
requirements
contract,
if
we
call
it
that,
at
that
point
in
time.
mr.
lawrence
c.
brown
all
right.
your
honor,
the
reason
my
client
was
forbidden...
assuming
i'm
not
limited
by
the
hypothetical
precisely,
the
reason
my
client
was
forbidden
to
bid
further
was
because
it
would
not
charge
supracompetitive
prices
and
wanted
to
compete,
and
was
in
direct
communication
with
nytel,
which
was
found
out,
it
was
forbidden,
and
then
they
decertified
my
client
from
bidding.
mr.
lawrence
c.
brown
thank
you,
your
honor.
