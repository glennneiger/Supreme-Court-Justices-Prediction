on
that
question...
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
may
i
ask
just
preliminarily
before
you
make
that
explanation,
who
was
in
the
removal
business,
other
than
att
technology
and
discon?
one
picture
that
i
have
is
an
agreement
that
would
leave
only
one
supplier
standing,
and
in
that
case,
if
there
were
only
the
two
in
the
business,
it
would
be
quite
a
different
situation
than
if
it
were
just
a
single
supplier
eliminated
and
many
still
standing,
so
what
was
it?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
young,
you're
not
treating
this
as
a
pleading...
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
young,
that's
the
part
that
i
don't
understand,
because
it's
not
clear
to
me
whether
your
position
is,
there
is
no
claim
to
state,
or
no
claim
was
adequately
stated,
the
insufficient
statement
versus,
given
this
situation,
there
is
no
possible
claim
to
be
stated.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
on
that,
you
gave
us
a
precise
question
about
the
second
circuit's
theory
about
group
boycott.
the
second
circuit
didn't
give
any
alternate
ruling
in
case
that
was
wrong,
and
yet
you're
asking
us
to
dispose
of
the
entire
case,
and
that
i
don't
understand
either.
if
we
answer
your
question
yes,
the
second
circuit
was
wrong,
shouldn't
we
then
say,
and
now
let
it
go
back
there?
