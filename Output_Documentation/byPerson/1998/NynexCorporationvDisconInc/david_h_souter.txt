but
isn't
there
going
to
be,
even
as
you
describe
it,
a
tendency
to
inflate
price
even
in
the
event
that
nynex
tomorrow
morning,
or
tomorrow
morning
after
the
complaint
was
filed,
decided
that
it
didn't
want
to
pay
that
much,
because
it
had
already
demonstrated
that
in
fact
it
would
pay
an
inflated
price,
the
competitors...
i
will
assume
for
the
sake
of
argument
there
were
three...
knew
that
it
would
pay
the
inflated
price,
and
therefore
i
assume
there
would
be
a
tendency
on
their
part
to
say,
let's
hold
them
to
their
inflated
price,
or
something
like
it.
so
the
very
fact
that
nynex
may
change
its
mind
tomorrow
morning
doesn't
necessarily
suggest
that
it
will
return
to
the
competitive
market
that
it
had
before
it
showed
its
willingness
to
pay
the
inflated
price.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
you
may...
and
i
realize
that,
so
in
fact
there's
a
fifth
player
here...
justice
david
h.
souter
i
know,
but
isn't
the
point
at
this
stage
that
that
is
a
matter
for
litigation
under
a
rule
of
reason
analysis?
in
other
words,
the
only
point
that
i
think
i'm
making
is
that
it
does
not
seem
to
be
implausible
as
a
matter
of
law,
on
the
allegations
of
the
complaint,
that
if
nynex
changed
its
mind
tomorrow
morning,
the
price
would
necessarily
return
to
the
pre-inflation
competitive
price.
it
seems
to
me
a
matter
for...
at
least
for
litigation,
isn't
that
so?
justice
david
h.
souter
a
regulated
monopolist.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
even
on
that
reading,
and
you're
probably
right
on
that,
why
still
don't
we
send
it
back
and
see...
let
them
have
a
crack
at
whether
there
is
a
different
rule
of
reason
and
conceptualization
that
might
apply?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
but
we'll
be
disposing
it
if
we
do
what
you
invite
us
to
do
and,
in
fact,
in
the
first
instance
we
won't
be
acting
as
a
reviewing
court.
justice
david
h.
souter
the
better
reason.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
i
think
he's
making
a
further
argument...
justice
david
h.
souter
mr.
wallace.
i
think
he's
making
the
argument
that
the
allegations
in
the
complaint
are
simply
insufficient,
that
they
have
not,
in
fact,
alleged
sufficiently
barriers
to
entry.
what's
the
government's
response
to
that?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
is
the
fact
that
they
disqualified
your
client
from
bidding,
perhaps,
an
answer
to
the
question?
justice
david
h.
souter
in
other
words,
they
didn't
just
say,
i'm
going
to
buy
from
a.
they
said,
b,
you
cannot
even
bid
any
more.
we
are
excluding
you
from
that
possibility.
is
that
enough
as
an
additional
fact?
