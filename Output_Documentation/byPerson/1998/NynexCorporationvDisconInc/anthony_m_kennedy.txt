so
if
costs
were
passed
on
to
the
consumer,
that's
just
irrelevant?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it
seems
to
me
if
you
have
a
monopolist
that's
the
buyer
and
the
agreement
is
to
eliminate
all
but
one
supplier,
and
if
you
assume
that
those
costs
are
going
to
be
passed
on
to
the
consumer,
i
don't
know
why
that
isn't
part
of
the
competitive
analysis,
at
least
under
the
rule
of
reason.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
suppose
we
could
show
the
costs
were
passed
on
to
the
consumers,
and
that
that
was
the
necessary
effect
of
this,
and
it's
a
rule
of
reason
analysis.
in
a
rule
of
reason
case,
the
court
would
not
admit
the
testimony
if
the
costs
were
passed
on
to
the
consumers,
unnecessarily?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
just
getting
back
to
the
relevant
market
one
more
time,
let's
assume
a
universe
in
which,
because
of
the
regulatory
scheme...
let's
assume
this.
100
percent
of
the
removal
costs
are
passed
on
to
the
consumer,
and
then
you
have
an
allegation
of
a
conspiracy
to
raise
those
costs
at
the
level
that
we're
discussing
here
of
the
suppliers
of
the
removal
services.
what
authority
do
i
cite
for
your
proposition
that
the
consumer
price
is
not
part
of
the
relevant
market?
when
i
write
that
down,
what
do
i
cite
for
that,
just
what
i
know
about
economics?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
thank
you.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
in
responding
to
justice
scalia's
hypothetical,
the
exclusive
requirements
contract
and
the
son-in-law,
is
your
answer
that
there
is
no
actionable
antitrust
violation
even
if
the
supplier
is
a
monopolist?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
the
purchaser
is
a
monopolist?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
that's
not
what...
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
think
to
make
your
hypothetical
work
you
have
to
assume
that
justice
scalia's
purchaser
of
the
services
is
a
monopolist
who
then
passes
on
the
cost
to
the
consumer.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
part
of
the
agreement
with
the
son-in-law
and
the
purchaser
is,
and
we'll
pass
this
cost
on
to
the
consumer?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
then
is
there
an
antitrust
violation?
