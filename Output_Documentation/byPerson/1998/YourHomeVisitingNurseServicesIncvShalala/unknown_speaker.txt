unknown
speaker
well,
but
you
had
one
round
of
judicial...
of
administrative
review
here,
didn't
you,
with
the
right
to
appeal
to
the
district
court?
unknown
speaker
ms.
gustin,
you
know,
there
has
to
be
an
end
to
litigation
at
some
point,
and
i
thought
the
normal
rule
is,
when
there's
a
final
judgment,
you
can
come
back
and
say,
you
know,
there
are
new
circumstances,
but
whether
to
open
for
that
reason
is
discretionary.
the
administrative
procedure
act
has
an
exception
for
judicial
review
for
matters
committed
to
agency
discretion
by
law,
and
i
have
always
thought
that
it's
committed
to
agency
discretion
whether
to
reopen
a
closed
case.
they
always
can,
but
i
don't
think
anybody
has
a
right
to
it.
unknown
speaker
and
if
they
decide
not
to,
that's
the
end
of
the
matter.
unknown
speaker
ms.
gustin,
the
statute
in
that
case
provided
for
removal.
i
mean,
for
reopening.
unknown
speaker
here,
as
i
understand
it,
the
statute
says
nothing.
the
statute
says,
get
your
act
together
in
180
days.
the
secretary
then
said,
yeah,
i'll
provide
for
reopening,
but
it's
going
to
be
just
this
one
shot,
no
review.
unknown
speaker
so
how
can
you
compare
a
case
where
congress
said,
you
have
a
right
to
reopen,
to
a
case
where
congress
made
no
such
provision.
unknown
speaker
and
which
one
is
that?
unknown
speaker
but
that
refers
to
reopening
when
the
year's
books
have
finally
been
closed
so
that
you
could
tell
what
the
actual
charges
were,
and
the
secretary
gave
you
that
opportunity,
didn't
she?
unknown
speaker
but
if
we
read
the
statute
to
say
what
it
does,
it
provides
for
the
year-end
adjustment,
and
that's
all
it
provides
for,
then
you
don't
have
any
such
argument.
unknown
speaker
the
reopening
process.
what
justice
ginsburg's
suggesting
is
that
there
are
two
reopening
processes.
one
is
the
statutory
requirement
for
reopening,
and
the
other
is
the
normal
discretion
that
any
agency
has,
but
a
nonreviewable
discretion,
to
reopen
a
closed
matter
if
it
thinks
it
to
be
a
good
idea.
unknown
speaker
but
you
can
come
back
10
years
later,
even
after
you've
gotten
this
review.
let's
assume
we
find
for
you
here.
then
you
find
something
else,
10
years
later,
and
you
come
back
again
and
you
ask
the
secretary
to
reopen.
she
says,
get
out
of
here,
it's
10
years
later.
you
have
judicial
review
of
that
again,
right?
unknown
speaker
well--
unknown
speaker
--life
is
too
short
for
this
kind
of
thing.
unknown
speaker
suppose
the
secretary
said,
i'm
going
to
withdraw
that
regulation.
forget
it.
i'll
stick
with
what
congress
wrote,
there
is
no
right
to
reopen,
period.
you
do
it
within
80
days,
and
if
you
don't
have
your
act
together
by
then,
it's
tough
luck.
unknown
speaker
so
perhaps
congress
was
mistaken
in
making
the
period
180
days.
but
that
was
congress'
period.
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
we
already
understand
that
if
that
is...
has
the
narrow
meaning
that
seems
to
have
been
given
to
it
by
this
court
it
isn't
across-the-board
reopening.
unknown
speaker
no,
i'm
focusing
on
what
can
be
covered,
not
the
time,
what
can
be
covered
by
that
explicit
statutory
provision,
and
i
thought
that
provision
was
confined
to
the
annual
overlook
of
the
month-by-month.
unknown
speaker
who
reopened
in
that
case?
unknown
speaker
yes,
and
i
gather
that's
essentially
what
your
position
is.
the
intermediary
can
reopen.
unknown
speaker
the
secretary
can
reopen.
unknown
speaker
it's
only
fair
that
you
should
be
allowed
to.
unknown
speaker
that's
an
argument
in
fairness
and
in
equity,
but
you
have
a
statute
to
deal
with.
unknown
speaker
and
regulations
to
deal
with,
and--
unknown
speaker
--my
notion
of
a
final
determination
is
a
final
decision
on
the
merits
of
the
claim.
a
final
decision
was
entered.
it
doesn't
become
unfinal
because
you've
moved
to
reopen
it.
you
know,
after
a
certain
amount
of
time
a
judgment
becomes
a
final
judgment.
thinking
of
civil
litigation,
you
can
move,
say
under
60(b),
but
you
still
have
a
final
judgment.
unknown
speaker
yeah,
and
it
could
be
reviewed
here,
too,
if
congress...
congress
had
provided
for
reopening
and
said,
and
it's
reviewable.
unknown
speaker
but
you
have
the
right
to
review
these
decisions
before
it
becomes
final,
do
you
not?
unknown
speaker
but
think...
you
know,
this
is
a
tremendously
complicated
and
extensive
system,
and
these
matters
have
to
come
to
an
end
sooner
or
later.
unknown
speaker
what
if
somebody
else
thinks
3
years
is
not
enough,
and
petitions
the
secretary
to
make
it
a
6-year
reopening
period,
and
the
secretary
says
no?
unknown
speaker
i
assume
that
would
be
appealable
on
your
theory
of
the
world.
the
secretary
has
made
a
final
determination
that
she
will
not
extend
the
3-year
period
to
6
years.
unknown
speaker
that's
the
argument.
unknown
speaker
this
person
is
in
good
faith
and
really
thinks
3
years
is
unreasonable,
wants
6
years,
so
that
person
should
have
a
right
to
appeal
the
secretary's--
unknown
speaker
--final
determination--
unknown
speaker
--not
to
make
it
6
years.
unknown
speaker
i
know
it's
a
different
question,
but--
unknown
speaker
--no,
that's
not
the
point
of
law.
the
point
of
law
is
whether
it's
a
final
determination.
that's
the
point
of
law
at
issue
here.
that's
a
final
determination
just
as
this
is.
unknown
speaker
i
will
not
extend
it
to
6
years.
unknown
speaker
no,
it
isn't.
no.
unknown
speaker
the
final
determination
at
issue
here
is
whether
she
will
reopen
the
determination
she's
already
made.
that's
the
final
determination.
she
says
no.
unknown
speaker
she
says
no,
i
will
not
reopen.
unknown
speaker
no
more
so
than
in
my
hypothetical.
this
person
who
wants
6
years
has
found
something
else
beyond
the
3-year
period
which
will
affect
the
total
amount
of
reimbursement
to
which
he
was
entitled.
unknown
speaker
of
course
you
know
how
to
answer
it.
you
have
to
answer
it
that
yes,
it's
reviewable
because
it's
a
final
determination.
unknown
speaker
but
then
that
again,
i
mean,
that
was
a
case
where
the
secretary
came
back
within
3
years.
unknown
speaker
and
i...
as
far
as
i
can
see,
you
are
basically
complaining
about
an
asymmetrical
statute
where
the
secretary
can
reopen
in
3
years
and
you
can't,
and--
unknown
speaker
--i
can
understand
that
you
think
that
that's
not
fair.
what
i
have
a
hard
time
seeing
is
how
you
make...
turn
everything
into
a
final
determination,
never
mind
that
we
have
had
a
final,
the
equivalent
of
a
final
adjudication
on
the
merits
of
the
claim.
unknown
speaker
maybe
it
could
be,
but
the
secretary
says
it
isn't,
right?
unknown
speaker
all
right.
so
that's
the...
if
it's
not
a
final
determination
within
the
meaning
of
1395oo--
unknown
speaker
--you're
out
of
luck.
unknown
speaker
unless
you're
going
to
go
under
mandamus.
is
that
basically--
unknown
speaker
--federal
question
jurisdiction,
you
have
a
statute
that
specifically
says,
no
action
shall
fall
under
federal
question
jurisdiction
unless
you
go
through
1395oo.
unknown
speaker
doesn't
it
say
that
specifically?
unknown
speaker
all
right.
so
if
we
follow
that,
you're
out
of
luck,
unless
it's
1395oo,
and
you're
not
in
1395oo
unless
it's
a
final
determination.
am
i
right?
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
but
what
do
we
do
about
the
statement,
no
action
against
the
united
states
commissioner
of
social
security
or
any
officer
or
employee
shall
be
brought
under
section
1331?
unknown
speaker
to
cover
on
any
claim
arising
under
this
title.
do
you
have
a
claim
arising
under
this
title?
unknown
speaker
i
have
to
decide,
do
you
have
a
claim,
or
are
you
trying
to
bring
a
claim
under
the
title?
if
i
answer
that
question,
i
think
you
are,
suppose
hypothetically...
yeah,
you
are.
you're
trying
to
bring
a
claim.
you're
trying
to
get
some
money
from
them.
that's
what
it
means.
if
i
believe
that--
unknown
speaker
--then
are
you
out
of
luck?
unknown
speaker
unless
you
have
a
final
determination,
and
they
say
you
don't,
but
you
say
you
do.
unknown
speaker
and
so
for
you
to
win
on
that,
you
have
to
show
not
only
are
they
wrong,
they're
just
really
unreasonable.
is
that
right?
unknown
speaker
alright.
now...
now,
to
focus
on
that,
what
is
unreasonable
about
saying,
these
things
have
to
come
to
an
end?
unknown
speaker
i
have
trouble
with
your
description
of
that
as
a
collateral
claim.
your
claim...
you
have
one
claim.
that
is,
you're
entitled
to
more
reimbursement.
you
have
a
number
of
reasons
why
the
procedure
should
allow
you
to
do
this.
unknown
speaker
but
to
slice
up
pieces
of
your
argument
in
support
of
your
claim
for
reimbursement
and
call
each
one
of
those
a
separate
claim
doesn't
make
a
whole
lot
of
sense.
unknown
speaker
i
think...
i
think
that's
what
perhaps
bothers
some
of
us,
is
that
in
your
view
any
time
you
come
in,
whether
it's,
you
know,
6
months
after
the
final
order
or
2
years
after
the
final
order,
and
say
i
want
a
reopening,
that
becomes
a
new
final
order,
and
i
really
don't
think
the
presumption
of
review
that
you're
talking
about
extends
that
far.
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
there--
unknown
speaker
--there
congress
has
said,
you
have
to
have
10,000
or
whatever
it
is,
but
congress
has
not
provided
any
period
for
reopening.
unknown
speaker
what
was
the
nature
of
the
reimbursement
that
you
say
you
were
entitled
to
and
didn't
get?
it
was
a
little
fuzzy
to
me.
unknown
speaker
and
you
made
that
claim
initially
and
were
turned
down.
unknown
speaker
you
made
a
claim
for
the
owner's
compensation
originally.
unknown
speaker
yes,
and
it
was
denied,
and
you
didn't
appeal
it.
unknown
speaker
it
was
not...
it
wasn't
denied
in
full,
denied
in
part.
they
gave
you
lower
compensation.
unknown
speaker
you
just
claimed
that
the
rate
should
have
been
higher.
unknown
speaker
well,
you
had...
you
knew
that
there
were
chain
operations--
unknown
speaker
--and
individual
operations.
why,
when
you
were
reduced
in
the
amount
you
claim,
didn't
you
make
that
argument,
we're
like
the
chains?
unknown
speaker
maybe
you
have
a
cause
of
action
against
the
intermediary.
unknown
speaker
that's
the
agency
here.
unknown
speaker
how
did
you
find
this
out
later
rather
than
earlier?
why
couldn't
you
have
found
it
out
sooner?
unknown
speaker
but
you
didn't
do
it.
you
didn't
do
it,
so--
unknown
speaker
--you're
saying,
we
could
have
done
it,
but
we
didn't
do
it,
and
now,
later
on,
we
want
to
do
it.
unknown
speaker
that's
essentially--
unknown
speaker
--but
you
could
have
gotten...
if
you
appealed
to
the
prr,
whatever--
unknown
speaker
--you
could
have
then
had
discovery,
and
so--
unknown
speaker
--but
you
said
we're
not
going
to
bother
using
the
remedy
that
congress
did
provide.
that
is,
in
180
days
you
can
pursue
this.
you
didn't...
because
you
said,
well,
maybe
you
would
have
failed.
i
don't--
unknown
speaker
--but
you
haven't
given
a
reason
why
you
didn't
have
a
perfectly
adequate
remedy
for
your
case
within
the
180
days.
you
said,
well,
before
you
got
to
the
board
you
would
not
have
had
discovery,
but
then
you
would
have
had
discovery.
unknown
speaker
in
other
words,
she's
saying,
that
is
not
this
case,
the
hypothetical
that
you--
unknown
speaker
--i'm
turning
the
tables
for
once,
you
know.
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
you
have
to
consider
perhaps
we
should
have
not
take
your
case
and
waited
for
such
a
case.
unknown
speaker
it's
not
a
perfect
world.
unknown
speaker
there
has
to
be
an
end
of
litigation.
you
could
say
in
any
case
that
new
evidence
comes
up
later
and
we
can
start
relitigating
all
over
again.
unknown
speaker
thank
you,
ms.
gustin.
unknown
speaker
ms.
blatt,
we'll
hear
from
you.
unknown
speaker
so
this
perhaps
presumably
happens
about
once
a
year?
unknown
speaker
now,
the
statutes
don't
refer
to
any
reopening
right.
unknown
speaker
but
the
secretary
has
nonetheless
promulgated
a
regulation
allowing
an
application
for
reopening.
unknown
speaker
within
3
years.
unknown
speaker
and
what
provision
of
the
statute
does
the
secretary
look
to
for
authority
to
even
have
such
a
regulation?
unknown
speaker
--reopening
were
granted
within
the
discretion
referred
to
by
the
secretary,
would
there
be
an
appeal
right
from
that--
unknown
speaker
--decision?
if
it's
reopened
and
a
decision
is
made,
then
that
would
trigger
some
new
appeal
right?
unknown
speaker
uh-huh.
unknown
speaker
what
if
there's
no
correction?
what
if,
in
one
of
those
rare
cases
where
the
secretary
reopens
in
order
not
to...
not
for
her
benefit,
but
for
the
benefit
of
a
claimant,
she
finds
nonetheless
against
the
claimant,
then
would
that
determination
be
appealable?
unknown
speaker
sort
of
a
one-way
appeal,
where
she
loses...
well,
let's
see.
where
there's
an
adjustment...
where
there
is
an
adjustment...
if
there's
an
adjustment
upward,
no
one
would
have
an
interest
in
appealing,
right?
if
there's
an
adjustment
downward,
the
claimant
can
appeal.
unknown
speaker
a
partial,
i
suppose.
unknown
speaker
that
way
the
claimant
doesn't
get
everything
that
he
or
she
wants.
would
that
be
a
final
order?
unknown
speaker
i
know
you
say
they
can
challenge
it,
but
is
it
in
your
view
a
final
order?
unknown
speaker
it's
under
oo?
you
think
it
comes
under--
unknown
speaker
--so
that
if
there
is
a
reopening,
a
discretionary
reopening,
and
there's
an
adjustment,
the
order
providing
for
the
adjustment
is
a
final
determination,
but
if
there's
no
adjustment,
it's
not
a
final
determination.
unknown
speaker
no,
but
we're
assuming...
i'm
assuming
there
has
been
a
3-week
evidentiary
hearing,
a
lot
of
findings
of
fact,
and
everything
else,
but
the
net
result
is,
no
adjustment.
unknown
speaker
that's
not
a
final
determination.
unknown
speaker
right.
okay.
yes.
unknown
speaker
of
course,
that
is
not
this
case,
you
would--
--no.
--have
to
say,
right.
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
the
secretary
could
issue
a
regulation
authorizing
review
in
that
situation?
unknown
speaker
well,
either
the
no-adjustment
case
or
this
case,
either
one.
unknown
speaker
would
it
be
consistent
with
the
statute?
unknown
speaker
ms.
blatt,
what
would
happen
under
the
current
regulations
if
the
secretary
reopens
and
says,
we
reimbursed
them
too
much
and
we
want
to
recoup
part
of
it,
and
then
the
provider
says,
well,
you
also
underpaid
us,
so
we
want
to
offset
the
underpayment
against
the
excess
payment.
did
the
secretary
allow
that
kind
of
a
defensive
set-off
if
the
secretary
initiates
the
reopening?
unknown
speaker
but
if
it's
on
a
discrete
issue--
unknown
speaker
--and
if
it
says
no--
unknown
speaker
--how
do
you
respond
to
the
essential
fairness
argument
that's
made
that
the
secretary
has
given
herself
3
years
to
reopen
and
if
she
loses
she
can
get
review,
but
the
providers
get
this
nonreviewable
order
that
they're
stuck
with.
unknown
speaker
they
reopen
only
the
issue
there
and
not
the
whole
determination?
i
mean,
i...
it's
bad
enough
as
justice
ginsburg
describes
it,
but
it
really
gets
unfair
when
you
say
the
secretary
does
reopen,
but
only
reopens
for
this
one
issue,
and
even
though
you
may
have
things
on
the
other
side,
you
can't
bring
them
in.
that
is
really
unfair.
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
she--
unknown
speaker
--but
she
can
say
no,
and
there's
no
review
for
it.
unknown
speaker
that's
also
an
issue-by-issue
thing.
unknown
speaker
and
as
i
recall
you
also
make
the
fairness
argument
that
the
secretary
gives
herself
3
years,
but
the
secretary
needs
3
years--
[laughter]
--more
than
an
individual
applicant
does
because
she
has
a
few
more
things
to
do.
unknown
speaker
you're
talking
about
the
brief
before
the
board,
or
the
brief
here.
unknown
speaker
in
this
court.
unknown
speaker
the
honorable
court
is
now
adjourned
until
monday
next
at
ten
o'clock.
