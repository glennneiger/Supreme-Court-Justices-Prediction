mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
secretary
has
reasonably
construed
the
medicare
act
not
to
require
administrative
review
of
an
intermediary's
decision
refusing
to
reopen
under
the
secretary's
regulations.
the
text
of
section
1395oo(a)
gives
providers
a
right
to
an
evidentiary
hearing
before
the
board
if
they
are
dissatisfied
with
the
final
determination
as
to
the
amount
of
their
total
program
reimbursement.
that
language
refers
to
the
intermediary's
annual
substantive
reimbursement
determination--
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
--yes.
for
each
cost
period
there
is
an
np...
a
notice
of
amount
of
program
reimbursement,
which
is
referred
to
as
the
npr,
and
it's
clear
that
the
language...
both
sides
concede
this,
petitioner
concedes
this,
that
that
is
a
final
determination
as
to
the
amount
of--
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
--that's
correct.
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
that's
correct.
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
that's
correct.
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
the
secretary
has
relied
on
her
general
rule-making
authority
to
promulgate
that,
which
is
in
section
1302
and
1395hh,
and
at
least
the
d.c.
circuit
and
the
ninth
circuit
have
held
that
the
secretary's
general
rule-making
authority
is
the
statutory
basis
for
the
reopening
regulation.
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
if
there's
a--
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
--yes,
with
respect
to
the
matters
revised,
so
if
there's
a
correction--
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
--and
obviously
if
the...
what
happened
in
the
regions
case,
if
there
was
a
request
for
recoupment,
then
there's
180
days
to
challenge
the
actual
change.
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
the
secretary's
position,
as
reflected
in
the
manual,
and
as
in
the
regulation,
is
that
there
has
to
be
an
actual
correction
or
an
adjustment
to
the
cost
report.
it's
rare,
but
it
does
happen,
where
there'll
be
a
notice
of
reopening
issued,
a
reconsideration,
and
yet
no
change.
it's
been
the
secretary's--
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
--that's
correct,
although
if
there's
just
a
partial
adjustment
upward,
the
secretary
has
construed
or
has
permitted
an
appeal
in
that
situation.
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
a
partial
adjustment.
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
the
regulations
give
the
providers
a
right
to
challenge
that
as
a
new
substantive
reimbursement
determination,
and
it's
actually
a
revised
npr
that's
issued,
and
they
can
challenge
the
matters
that
got
revised,
or
that
were
revised.
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
it's
consistent
with
the
language
of
a
final
determination
as
to
the
amount
of
total
program
reimbursement.
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
yes.
it's
under
oo(a)(1)(a)(i).
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
that's
correct.
there's...
the
secretary
has
rationally
distinguished
and
said,
if
there's
just
a
mere
refusal
to
alter
or
reconsider
a
prior
determination
there's
no
right
to
an
evidentiary
hearing
before
the
board.
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
right.
it's--
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
--it
wouldn't
be
an
evidentiary
hearing.
it's
just
before
the
intermediary.
the
intermediary
would
review
it,
and
then
not
make--
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
--that
has
been
the
secretary's
position
thus
far.
i
mean,
that's
not
what
happened
in
this
case.
there's
no--
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
--there's
no
question
that
there
is
not
a...
that
there
was
no
reopening
here.
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
in
this
case,
or--
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
--i
think
it's
possible.
i
don't
think
the
most--
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
--yes.
i
think
it's
not
the
most
natural
reading,
to
read
a
mere
refusal
to
reconsider
a
prior
determination
a
new
final
determination
as
to
the
total
amount,
but
i
think
the
statute's
ambiguous,
and
the
secretary
could
articulate
a
reasonable
rationale
to
justify
that
result.
the
question
here,
of
course,
is
whether
the
secretary
reasonably
construed
the
statute
not
to
require
a
full-blown
evidentiary
hearing,
and
we
think
that
language
supports
that
for
two...
basically
two
reasons,
and
that
is
because
it
is
the
secretary's
regulations,
not
the
medicare
act
itself,
that
provides
the
opportunity
to
seek
reopening,
and
we
think
it
does
further
the
interest
of
administrative
finality.
and
this
court
reached
a
quite
similar
conclusion
in
the
califano
v.
sanders
case,
when
the
court
held
that
there
was
no
judicial
review
for
refusals
to
reopen
social
security
benefit
determinations,
and
the
court
said
that
for
two
reasons.
one
was
the
opportunity
to
reopen
was
afforded
solely
by
the
secretary's
regulations
and
not
the
social
security
act,
and
a
contrary
reading
would
frustrate
congress'
intent
to
impose
a
specific
time
limit
on
the
review
of
the
initial
decision.
and
this
complaint
about
an
anomaly
with
reopening
under
the
medicare
act
is
no
different
under
the
social
security
act.
the
claimants
are
permitted
the
opportunity
to
seek
reopening,
and
it
may
or
may
not
get
granted
but
there's
no
right
of
review
and,
of
course,
the
commissioner
of
social
security
can
institute
reopening,
and
if
there's
a
change
in
the
benefits,
then
only
the
claimant
will
get
review.
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
reopening
is
what's
known
in
the...
it's
issue-specific,
and
so
if
it's
on
that
issue,
i
imagine...
i'm
not
positive
of
this...
that
there
is
that
kind
of
give-and-take.
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
if
it's
not
on
the
same
issue,
then
they
need
to
formally
request
a
reopening
on
that
issue,
and
then
the
intermediary
would
consider
it
based
on
the
criteria.
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
if
it
says
no,
it's
not
reviewable,
no,
and
the
review
process
would
be
issue-specific,
and
only
if
there
was
an
adjustment
would
that
be
subject
to--
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
--right.
in
addition
to
this
being
no
different
than
the
social
security
act,
which,
by
the
way,
i
think
is
quite
significant
and
governs
all
medicare
beneficiaries
on
whose
behalf
these
hospitals
are
providing
the
services
as
well
as
physicians
who
provide
services,
they're
governed
by
the
same
regime--
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
--they
can
bring
them
in,
and
they
can
request
reopening--
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
--as
3
years--
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
--that's
right,
and
i
don't
think
there
would
be
any
difference
under
the
social
security
act.
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
yes.
it's...
the
way
the...
the
way
the
process
works,
you're
only
entitled
to
an
administrative
hearing
before
an
alj
if
there's
an
actual
change
in
the
benefits,
and
there's
no
review
if
there's
simply
a
denial.
the
other
reason
why,
that
there's
not
an
irrational
balance
is
that
this
is
a
120
billion
dollar
program,
and
there
are,
as
we
said
in
our
acquiescence
to
the
petition
in
this
case,
a
backlog
of
10,000
cases
before
the
board,
and
it
takes
over
3
years
just
to
get
a
hearing
on
initial
challenges
to...
on
challenges
to
the
initial
npr's,
and
it's
just...
it
would
be
an
enormous
administrative
as
well
as
financial
burden
on
the
system
to
open
this
up
to
any
refusal
to
reconsider
a
prior
determination.
presumably
the
petitioner's
argument
would
extend
to
refusals
to
reconsider,
refusals
to
reopen,
and
so
forth
and
so
on.
you'd
have
3
years
after
any
kind
of
decision,
and
that
would
be
a
new
final
determination
under
that
reading,
and
the
secretary
has
rationally
cut
it
off.
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
the
simple
truth
of
the
matter
is,
the
secretary
administers
this
program...
there
are
38
intermediaries...
and
has
no
access
to
the
hospital's
records.
the
hospital,
on
the
other
hand,
are
by
and
large
very
sophisticated
entities,
and
they're
actually
very
good
about
appealing
within
the
180
days.
they
have
6
months
to
appeal.
this
case
is
particularly
instructive,
because
here
the
petitioner
protested
the
50,000
dollars
that's
at
issue
here
on
the
cost
report.
this
was
a
red
flag
that
the
provider
was
going
to
appeal,
and
as
far
as
we
could
tell,
there
is
no
reason
why
the
provider
did
not
appeal.
as
far
as
the
way
the
petitioner's
brief
was
structured
is,
the
petitioner
did
appeal
cost
years
prior
to
1989--
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
--i
think
it's
the
brief...
the
blue
brief
on
the
merits
in
this
court--
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
--says
the
petitioner
discovered
the
salary
survey
in
the
course
of
appealing
prior
years,
and
in
all
events
the
petitioner
appealed
in
1987,
it
appealed
4
or
5
years
after
1989,
and
could
have
sought
discovery.
there's
no
reason
to
presume
bad
faith
on
the
intermediary
with
respect
to
production.
and
again,
like
i
said,
there's
just
no
reason
that
the
provider
didn't
appeal
in
this
case.
if
i
could
also
turn
to
clause
(ii),
if
i
could
refer
to
it
that
way,
and
that's
1395x(v)(1)(a)(ii),
which
this
court
referred
to
as
clause
(ii)
in
the
good
samaritan
case,
we
think
that
that...
that
this
decision
squarely
forecloses
any
argument
that
clause
(ii)
is
the
basis
for
reopening
and
requires
a
reopening
procedure.
what
the
court
held
in
good
samaritan
was
that
clause
(ii)
is
ambiguous,
and
it
upheld
the
secretary's
narrow
reading
as
a
year-end,
and
the
court
several
times
referred
to
it
as
a
year-end
book-balancing
accounting
reconciliation,
and
that's...
that
would
reconcile
the
amounts
paid
to
the
provider
during
the
year
that
were
simply
estimates,
pre-audit,
periodic
payments
with
the
amount
that
the
npr
determined
to
be
allowable.
and
that's...
actually,
if
you
look
at
the
npr
in
this
case,
it
shows
that
reconciliation,
and
i
think
it's
on
page...
i
think
it's...
it's
page
36
of
the
joint
appendix,
so
this
is
how
the
secretary
administers
the
program.
this
is
how
the
regulations
work.
a
reopening
procedure
is
something
entirely
distinct
from
that.
it's
a
substantive
redetermination,
or
at
least
a
request
to
redetermine
what
had
been
reimbursable.
if
i
could
also
address
the
issue
that
these
are
private
insurance
companies,
these
are
intermediaries
making
the
decision,
these
are
the
secretary's
agents
and
they
do
act
under
her
close
oversight
and
supervision,
and
we
think
it's
also
significant
that
intermediaries
are
nominated
by
the
providers
themselves,
and
if
there's
some
suspicion
that
the
intermediary
is
biased
or
unfair
the
provider
is
always
free
to
request
a
change
in
the
intermediary,
or
not
nominate
the
intermediary.
there's
simply
no
allegation
in
this
case
that
intermediaries
act
distinctively
with
bad
faith
with
respect
to
reopening
as
opposed
to
any
other
initial
decision
and,
of
course,
the
provider
and
all
hospitals
have
the
opportunity
to
challenge
the
initial
underlying
determination
within
the
6-month
time
period.
then
if
i
could
also
address
the
question
of
section
1331
jurisdiction,
in
addition
to
the
plain
language
of
section
405(h),
the
third
sentence,
which
forecloses
any
action
arising
under
the
medicare
act,
this
court
in
heckler
v.
ringer
and
again
in
weinberger
v.
salfi
made
clear
that
the
court
was
not
going
to
look
at
procedural
labels
or
substantive
labels,
but
would
look
at
whether
the
standing
and
substantive
basis
for
the
claim
arises
under
the
medicare
act.
and
so
i'm
not
sure
the
provider...
the
provider
in
this
case
talks
about
a
collateral
challenge.
that's
not
from
any
decision...
that
doesn't
come
from
any
decision
of
this
court.
the
only
exception,
of
course,
is
the
michigan
academy
decision
and
that
was
dealing...
a
far
cry
from
this
situation.
there
was
no
review
whatsoever
of
the
secretary's
regulations
under
part
b,
and
part
a,
which
involves
this
case
as
well,
now,
as
part
b,
providers
are
free
to
raise
any
kind
of
challenge
before
the
board
and
under
the
part
a
and
part
b
beneficiary
side,
the
administrative
law
judge,
and
in
the
courts.
they
can
bring
both
amount
challenges
to
their
benefits,
as
well
as
any
kind
of
facial
challenge
to
a
regulation,
and
so
we
just
don't
think
the
michigan
academy
exception
or
distinction
has
any
relevance
to
this
case,
when
there
was
a
full
right
of
review.
and
again,
i
would
also
remind
the
court
about
the
sanders
decision
where,
under
the
social
security
act,
there
is
no
right
of
review,
and
the
court
made
clear
in
that
case
that
1331
was...
excuse
me,
that
section
405(h)
barred
jurisdiction,
federal
question
jurisdiction
under
section
1331.
then
if
i
could
just
finally
address
mandamus,
the
mandamus
aspect
of
this,
which
the
petitioner
also
relies
on,
we
think
mandamus
is
barred
by
the
second
sentence
of
section
405(h),
but
in
all
events
there
is
no
basis
for
seeking
mandamus
relief
in
this
case.
the
two
challenges
are,
of
course,
the
refusal
to
reopen,
and
then
the
underlying
complaint
about
the
owner's
compensation.
both
of
those
require
discretion
on
the
part
of
the
intermediary.
the
regulations
are
in
the
manual.
it's
plain
on
its
face
that
the
decision
whether
to
reopen
is
discretionary,
and
certainly
the
question
about
whether
costs
are
reasonable
and
allowable
under
the
statute
also
requires
the
exercise
of
discretion.
and
as
to
the
underlying
claim
about
entitlement
to
reimbursement,
certainly
there's
no
question
that
the
petitioner
failed
to
exhaust
its
administrative
remedies
by
not
appealing
within
the
time
frame.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
that
completes
my
argument.
