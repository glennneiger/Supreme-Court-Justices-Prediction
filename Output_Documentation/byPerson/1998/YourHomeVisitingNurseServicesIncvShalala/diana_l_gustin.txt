ms.
diana
l.
gustin
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
petitioner
is
here
today
to
complain
about
an
insurance
company.
in
this
case
the
insurance
company
is
a
fiscal
intermediary
serving
as
the
agent
for
the
government,
reviewing
medicare
cost
reports,
making
determinations
about
allowable
cost,
and
also
making
decisions
about
whether
or
not
the
cost
report
may
be
reopened.
in
this
case,
the
petitioner,
a
home
health
agency,
discovered
new
and
material
evidence
after
the
initial
period
for
requesting
appeal,
and
therefore
made
a
request
for
a
reopening
of
the
cost
report.
the
intermediary,
the
insurance
company,
denied
the
request
to
reopen,
considered
this
a
final
determination,
and
then
we
filed
an
appeal
for
review
of
that
final
agency
action
at
the
provider
reimbursement
review
board.
the
review
board
declined
to
accept
the
case,
stating
it
did
not
have
jurisdiction
to
review
the
refusal
to
reopen.
the
district
court
upheld
the
jurisdictional
decision
of
the
board
and
the
sixth
circuit
also
upheld
the
district
court,
which
brings
us
here
today.
we
would
like
to
begin
with
the
statement
that
there
is
a
presumption
that
there
will
be
judicial
review
of
final
agency
action,
and
this
presumption
is
noted
in
the
court's
decision
of
bowen
v.
michigan
academy
of
family
physicians,
where
the
court's
opinion
started
with
saying,
we
begin
with
a
strong
presumption
that
congress
intends
judicial
review
of
administrative
action.
ms.
diana
l.
gustin
we
had
an
opportunity,
a
chance
to
make
a
request
for
an
appeal,
but
based
upon
the
information
that
we
had
at
that
time,
an
appeal
was
not
sought,
but
when
we
discovered
new
and
material
evidence
which
we
believe
shows
that
the
intermediary
violated
its
own
regulations,
upon
discovery
of
the
new
and
material
evidence,
we
believe
that
gives
us
the
right
to
request
the
reopening,
and
if
that
reopening
is
unlawfully
withheld,
we
sought
review,
and
so
it's
the
review
of
the
refusal,
which
is
final
agency
action,
which
we
are
seeking.
ms.
diana
l.
gustin
well--
ms.
diana
l.
gustin
--your
honor,
in
this
court's
decision
in
icc
v.
brotherhood
of
locomotive
engineers,
which
was
decided
in
1977,
this
court
held
that
a
refusal
to
reopen
which
was
based
upon
new
and
material
evidence
should
have
some
sort
of
review,
because
otherwise--
ms.
diana
l.
gustin
--that
is--
ms.
diana
l.
gustin
--well--
ms.
diana
l.
gustin
--well,
first
of
all,
i
think
that
there
is
a
statutory
provision
within
the
medicare
statute
which
requires
reopening.
ms.
diana
l.
gustin
and
that
would
be
section
1395x(v)(1)(a),
clause
(ii).
ms.
diana
l.
gustin
well,
whether
or
not
that
refers
to
just
a
year-end
book-balancing
i
think
has
not
been
decided
by
this
court,
but
in
fact
the
secretary
uses
that
reopening
process
for
more
than
simply
a
year-end
book-balancing
to
compare
estimated
cost
with
actual
cost,
and
so
we
would
say
first
of
all
to
justice
ginsburg's
question,
there
is
statutory
authority
for
a
reopening
within
that.
secondly--
ms.
diana
l.
gustin
--if
you
read
the
statute
that
way,
but
i
would
impress
upon
the
court
that
in
this
case
in
particular
the
secretary
used
the
reopening
process
beyond
that
year-end
book-balancing
period,
and
the
secretary
routinely
uses
the
reopening
process
beyond
that
simple
year-end--
ms.
diana
l.
gustin
--well,
i
don't
think
that
there...
that
it's
clearly
stated
that
congress
wanted
a...
an
unreviewable,
completely
insulated
final
agency
action,
and
i
think
that
the
decision
in
michigan
academy
talks
at
great
length
about
the
fact
that
the
presumption
to
judicial
review
is
so
important
that
we
cannot
just
think
that
congress
meant
something
not
to
be
reopened
that
it
requires--
ms.
diana
l.
gustin
--i
believe
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
ms.
diana
l.
gustin
as
the
ninth
circuit
held--
ms.
diana
l.
gustin
--first
of
all,
in
regard
to
the
10-year
time
frame
that
you
put
on
that,
i
think
that
that
would
only
apply
in
cases
where
there
was
fraud
or
abuse
alleged,
because
there's
normally
a
3-year
time
period
to
request
a
reopening,
and
the
secretary--
ms.
diana
l.
gustin
--well,
i
think
that
having
your
act
together
is
really
the
problem
here,
because
it
wasn't
a
matter
of
whether
or
not
we
had
our
act
together.
it
was
a
matter
of
information
that
the
intermediary
had
or
had
access
to
that
we
did
not
have
access
to,
and
this--
ms.
diana
l.
gustin
--i
think
congress
was
not
mistaken,
but
i
think
that
congress
had
the
section
that
i
referenced
earlier,
1395x(v)(1)(a),
clause
(ii),
which
allows
for
corrective
retroactive
adjustments
when
a
provider
is
either
underpaid
or
overpaid,
and
that's
been
a
part
of
the
act
from
the
beginning,
but
i
think
that
the--
ms.
diana
l.
gustin
--well,
in
the
court's
decision
that
discussed
that
provision
of
the
statute,
whether
or
not
the
book-balancing
occurred
at...
within
the
180
days,
which
would
be
the
narrow
meaning,
was
not
really
discussed
in
terms
of
the
time
period
for
the
retroactive
corrective
adjustments,
and
to
the
contrary--
ms.
diana
l.
gustin
--well,
i
don't
believe
that
that
provision
should
be
confined
to
that
and,
indeed,
it's
not
in
practicality.
as
i
stated
in
this
case,
beyond
that
180-day
time
period,
this
cost
report
was
reopened,
because
we
had
discovered
that
a
nurse
did
not
have
an
appropriate
license,
so
we
reported
that
to
the
intermediary,
and
then
the
costs
for
the
visits
had
to
be
reduced,
and
so
the
narrow
view
of
the
year-end
book-balancing
happening
only
to
do
that
balancing
between
interim
payments
and
final
payments--
ms.
diana
l.
gustin
--the
intermediary
reopened.
ms.
diana
l.
gustin
yes.
ms.
diana
l.
gustin
yes.
ms.
diana
l.
gustin
yes,
because
if
we
discover
wrongful
acts
that
unfairly
deprived
us
of
reimbursement
to
which
we
were
entitled
under
the
act,
then
we
should
also
be
allowed
to
claim
the
recovery.
ms.
diana
l.
gustin
yes.
ms.
diana
l.
gustin
and
we
believe
that
the
statute
itself
at
1395oo
clearly
states
that
congress
intended
that
we
have
an
appeal
process
after
a
final
determination,
and
that
that
language
is
clear,
a
final
determination,
and
it
is
only
through
the
secretary's
interpretation
of
that
phrase
to
mean
one,
and
only
one
kind
of
a
final
determination,
that
she
prohibits
or
restricts
our
ability
to
obtain
review.
and
so
we
believe
under
the
chevron
test
the
plain
meaning
of
the
statute
must
govern
first
of
all.
a
final
determination
is
what
congress
said,
and
we
have
a
final
determination,
and
indeed
it
makes
sense
that
final
determinations
of
this
nature
should
proceed--
ms.
diana
l.
gustin
--that's
correct,
your
honor,
but
under
60(b)
courts
have
held
in
the
sixth
circuit
that
a
refusal
to
grant
the
relief
sought
under
60(b)
when
there
is
no
new
and
material
evidence
can
be
reviewed,
but
only
as
to
whether
or
not
there
was
an
abuse
of
discretion,
because
otherwise--
ms.
diana
l.
gustin
--well,
i
believe
that
congress
provided
for
review
by
stating
that
a
final
determination
as
to
total
program
reimbursement
can
be
reviewed
if
you
take
the
appropriate
steps,
and
the
refusal
to
reopen
is
a
final
determination
as
to
program
reimbursement,
so
i
believe
that
we
meet
the
definition
under
the
statute
itself,
and
i
believe
that
that's
also
where
the
presumption
to
judicial
review
comes
back,
because
the
statutory
language
i
believe
is
clear.
but
if
you
believe
you
must
interpret
the
language
in
the
statute,
then
the
burden
is
upon
the
secretary
by
clear
and
convincing
proof
to
show
that
congress
did
not
want
judicial
review,
and
there
is
no
language
in
the
congressional
history
which
states
that
they
considered
whether
or
not
there
would
be
a
reopening
process
and
that
that
should
be
totally
and
completely
up
to
the
discretion
of
the
insurance
company
employee.
we
don't
even
have
a
governmental
entity
reviewing
the
request
to
reopen.
we
have
private
insurance
companies
that
contract
with
the
government,
and
we
don't
know
anything
about
the
individuals
who
are
making
these
decisions,
so
we
would
be
leaving
within
the
discretion
of
one
person
decisions
that
could
be
worth
millions
of
dollars
to
hospitals.
i
don't
think
there's
anything
in
the
congressional
record
to
indicate
that
they
wanted
that
to
be
the
case,
and--
ms.
diana
l.
gustin
--you...
based
upon
what
you
know
at
that
time,
and
i
think
it's
important
to
understand
that
my
client
and
other
providers
should
surely
have
the
right
to
rely
upon
the
intermediary
to
act
lawfully
and
to
give
us
the
information
that
they
are
making
the
decision
upon,
but
when
they
don't
give
us
the
information,
or
give
us
the
wrong
information,
whether
it
is
intentional
or
by
mistake,
and
we
discover
it
later,
that
we
should
have
a
right
to
request
a
reopening.
ms.
diana
l.
gustin
exactly,
and
i
think
the
3-year
period
within
which
you
can
request
a
reopening
is
an
appropriate
time
period
to
expect
the
provider
to
act,
unless,
for
example,
there
is
fraud
or
intentional
wrongdoing,
which
i
mentioned,
and
there's
no
time
period
under
the
regulation
for
requesting
reopening
in
that
case.
ms.
diana
l.
gustin
well--
ms.
diana
l.
gustin
--i
think
the
secretary
has
the
right
to
make
rules
that
are
considered
reasonable,
and
whether
or
not
someone
could
make
the
argument
that
a
6-year
period
was
not
a
reasonable--
ms.
diana
l.
gustin
--interpretation
of
the
statute.
ms.
diana
l.
gustin
that
would
be--
ms.
diana
l.
gustin
--i
think
that
would
be--
ms.
diana
l.
gustin
--a
different
question
than
what
we're
dealing
with
here--
ms.
diana
l.
gustin
--and
i
think
different
points
of
law
apply
to
that,
and
that
would
be
whether
or
not
the
6-year
period
was
a
reasonable
interpretation
of
the
statute,
as
well--
ms.
diana
l.
gustin
--but
a
final
determination--
ms.
diana
l.
gustin
--but
the
final
determination
we're
referring
to
here
is
the
one
that's
laid
out
in
the
statute,
which
is
as
to
the
amount
of
total
program
reimbursement
covered
by
the
cost
report.
ms.
diana
l.
gustin
the
6-year--
ms.
diana
l.
gustin
--the
final--
ms.
diana
l.
gustin
--yes,
and
we
say
that
the
final
determination
when
she
says
she
will
not
reopen
is
one
which
goes
to
the
total
amount
of
program
reimbursement,
which
is
what
the
statute
defines--
ms.
diana
l.
gustin
--well,
that
case
is
not
before
the
court,
your
honor--
[laughter]
--and
i
really
don't
know
how
to
answer
that
in
terms
of
how
it
applies
to
this
argument.
ms.
diana
l.
gustin
well
then
it's
reviewable
because
it's
a
final
determination
as
to
the
total
amount
of
program
reimbursement,
but
we
have
a
regulation
here.
this
regulation
concerning
the
3-year
time
period
was
before
this
court
most
recently
with
regard
to
the
graduate
medical
education
reaudit
regulation,
and
there
the
secretary
argued
successfully
and
very
strongly
that
the
3-year
period
was
what
was
important,
but
with
regard--
ms.
diana
l.
gustin
--yes.
ms.
diana
l.
gustin
well,
we're
complaining--
ms.
diana
l.
gustin
--i
think
it's
important,
your
honor,
to
focus
upon
the
abuse
of
discretion
that
is
possible
in
deciding
whether
or
not
a
final
determination
can
be
more
than
simply
the
first
notice
of
program
reimbursement
letter
that
you
receive.
ms.
diana
l.
gustin
the
secretary--
ms.
diana
l.
gustin
--yes.
ms.
diana
l.
gustin
if
the
secretary--
ms.
diana
l.
gustin
--well,
federal
question
jurisdiction.
ms.
diana
l.
gustin
i
believe
that--
ms.
diana
l.
gustin
--it
says
that
specifically,
your
honor,
but--
ms.
diana
l.
gustin
--well,
there
are
alternative
arguments,
which
were
presented,
and
i
think
that
under
federal
question
jurisdiction
as
an
alternative,
if
you're
not
allowed
to
use
the
1395oo
administrative
procedure--
ms.
diana
l.
gustin
--in
the
normal
route,
and
if
you
have
raised
a
claim
that
is
collateral
to
the
underlying
amounts
of
the
benefit
claim,
then
federal
question
jurisdiction
is
appropriate,
as
it
was
in
bowen
v.
michigan
academy.
ms.
diana
l.
gustin
on
any
claim.
ms.
diana
l.
gustin
well,
we
believe
that
on
any
claim
is
like
a
term
of
art,
and
that
means
a
claim
of
benefits,
but
if
we
claim
that
there
is
an
abuse
of
discretion,
if
we
claim
that
the
intermediary
acted
unlawfully,
violated
its
own
regulations,
that
that
is
a
collateral
issue,
just
like
in
bowen
v.
michigan
academy.
the
statute
or
the
regulation,
i
mean,
which--
ms.
diana
l.
gustin
--uh-huh.
ms.
diana
l.
gustin
no.
ms.
diana
l.
gustin
yes.
ms.
diana
l.
gustin
i...
that
they're
wrong,
they're
unreasonable,
and
they're
violating
their
own...
their
own
regulations,
and--
ms.
diana
l.
gustin
--well,
there
are
two
collateral
claims
that
were
raised.
one
was
the
collateral
claim
that
their
refusal
to
reopen
and
no
judicial
review
is
unreasonable,
all
right.
then
the
second
collateral
issue
that
was
raised
was
the
fact
that
the
owner's
compensation
is
required
to
be
in
accordance
with
comparable
institutions,
and
that
they
had,
or
had
access
to
a
salary
survey
which
had
a
salary
range
which
was
much
higher
than
what
they
were
applying
to
the
petitioner,
and
therefore
they
were
not
applying
owner's
compensation
in
accordance
with
their
own
regulation,
and
so
that
was
a
violation
of
that
regulation.
a
collateral
claim,
too,
asking
for
additional
owner's
compensation,
a
claim
that
they
didn't
do
it
right,
and
if
they
violated
that
regulation
or
other
regulations,
or
a
regulation
is
found
invalid,
then
we
believe
that's
a
collateral
claim,
not
about
the--
ms.
diana
l.
gustin
--uh-huh.
ms.
diana
l.
gustin
well,
there
are
arguments
in
the
alternative,
your
honor,
because
first
and
foremost
we
believe
that
the
statute
itself
allows
us
judicial
review,
or
some
type
of
review
process
for
abuse
of
discretion,
and
we
only
turn
to
section
1331
for
federal
question
jurisdiction
and
then
posit
the
claim
itself
as
collateral
to
that
normal
appeals
process
as
an
alternative
view,
an
alternative
way
of
looking
at
this,
because
we
believe
there
must
be
some
kind
of
review,
because
congress
did
not
prohibit
review
of
this
final
agency
action
and,
indeed,
when--
ms.
diana
l.
gustin
--i
don't
think
that
the
broader
reading
of
any
time
you
come
in
is
applicable
here,
and
i
don't
think
it's
necessary
to
view
this
case
in
those
terms.
i
think
it's
appropriate
to
have
a
reasonable
time
period
to
limit
the
reopening,
just
like
it's
appropriate
for
congress
to
say,
the
dollar
amount
in
controversy
for
your
claim
must
be
10,000.
ms.
diana
l.
gustin
i
think
there's
a
procedural--
ms.
diana
l.
gustin
--no,
but
i
think
the
secretary
has
filled
that
gap
with
her
regulation,
and
i
think
that's
an
appropriate
time
period,
and
the
secretary
uses
that
time
period
and
has
relied
upon
it
and
convinced
this
court
that
millions
of
dollars
can
be
recovered
from
hospitals
within
that
3-year
time
period
under

graduate

education
regulation

hospital.
and
i
think
that
congress
wanted
the
providers
to
stand
on
an
even
footing
with
the
secretary
in
regard
to
these
corrective
retroactive
adjustments,
and
that's
why
the
language
in
the
statue
says
that
providers
or
the
secretary
may
have
corrective
retroactive
adjustments
when
the
provider's
payments
have
been
excessive
or
when
they
have
been
underpaid.
congress
gave
us
either
situation,
but
the
secretary's
reading
turns
that
system
upside
down
and
makes
it
so
that
the
secretary
only
has
that
right,
because
we
have
no
right
to
correct
the
secretary's
action
if
we
cannot
have
review
of
a
refusal,
and
therefore
the
most
abusive
situations
may
go
uncorrected
if
the
secretary's
system
is
allowed
to
stand.
intermediary
insurance
company
employees
could
intentionally
decide
not
to
reopen
because
they
don't
like
the
particular
provider.
they
could
have
a
system
of
covering
up
information,
and
as
long
as
they
kept
that
information
hidden
for
180
days,
we'd
have
no
recourse.
we
talk
about
final--

--the
nature
of
the
reimbursement
was
owner's
compensation.
the
owners
who
operate
the
home
health
agency
are
entitled
to
compensation,
and
the
regulation
says
that
the
compensation
should
be
in
accordance
with
comparable
institutions.
ms.
diana

i
beg
your
pardon?

it
was
on

it
was
claimed
on
the
cost
report.

and

was
made,

was
taken.

lower
compensation.
ms.
diana
l.
gustin
yes,
because
it
should
have
been
based
upon
the
salary
survey
for
chain
operations,
because
this
was
a
chain
operation.
the
salary
survey
that
they
used
was
for
one
individual
agency,
and
that
range
was,
like,
28
xx
58--
ms.
diana
l.
gustin
--yes.
ms.
diana
l.
gustin
well,
we
had
reported
as
a
chain.
we
did
not
know
that
the
intermediary
had
the
salary
survey
for
chain
operations
which
established
a
salary
range
between
71,000
and
98,000
dollars.
that
salary
range
was
not
applied
to
these
petitioners.
instead,
a
much
lower
salary
range
for
an
individual
agency
was
applied.
this
information
about
the
salary
survey
was
within
the
intermediary's
knowledge.
it
was
not
within
our
knowledge.
they
did
not
tell
us
that
they
had
this
other
salary
survey
and
that
it
was
being
used
against
us,
and
we
believe
that
they
should
have,
and
that
that
was
a
violation
of
the
law
because
they
should
have
told
us
everything
that
they
were
basing
their
adjustment
on,
and
we
have
a
right
to
rely
upon
the
intermediary
doing
the
right
thing,
doing
the--
ms.
diana
l.
gustin
--well,
we
don't
have
a--
ms.
diana
l.
gustin
--i
don't
think
we
have
a
cause
of
action
against
the
intermediary
because
they're
the
agent
for
the
government,
and
the
cause
of
action
is
supposed
to
be
brought
against
the
principal,
because
they're
responsible
for
what
their
agent
does
and,
indeed,
it's
the
government
and
their
position
that
they
don't
have
to
allow
any
type
of
review
of
the
intermediary's
action,
which
keeps
us
from
getting
the
appropriate
amount
of
compensation,
and
if
we
could
prove
this
unlawful
action,
then
failing
to
reopen
would
be
an
abuse
of
discretion,
and
then
we
would
have
the--
ms.
diana
l.
gustin
--well,
the
discovery
process
that
would
be
available
would
only
happen
if
you
filed
a
normal
appeal
process
and
started
down
the
normal
route
with
provider
reimbursement
review
board,
and
then,
even
if
we
had
done
that
and
asked
the
question,
there's
no
guarantee
that
they
would
have
then
told
the
truth,
and--
ms.
diana
l.
gustin
--no,
we
didn't
do
it.
ms.
diana
l.
gustin
no--
ms.
diana
l.
gustin
--we're
saying,
based
upon
the
information
that
we
had,
we--
ms.
diana
l.
gustin
--prrb.
ms.
diana
l.
gustin
and
we
may
or
may
not
have
found
out
the
information
then,
because
they
may
have
said,
no,
we
don't
have
the
survey--
ms.
diana
l.
gustin
--i
think
that
your
concern
actually
shifts
the
whole
question
of
finality
into
the
other
realm
in
which
all
providers
who
were
denied
reimbursement
for
any
reason
would
have
to
file
an
appeal
within
180
days,
or
know
that
even
if
they
discovered
wrongful
action
on
the
part
of
intermediary
there's
no
recourse.
even
if
the
law
was
changed
and
if
regulations
were
determined
invalid
after
the
180
days,
there
would
have
been
no
recourse.
ms.
diana
l.
gustin
we
would
have
had
discovery,
but--
ms.
diana
l.
gustin
--oh.
but
this
case--
ms.
diana
l.
gustin
--yes.
that
is
not
this
case,
but
this
case
stands
for
more
than
just
this
case,
because
every
provider
will
be
bound
by
the
ruling
that
comes
out
of
this
court,
and
so
i
think
it's
important
to
understand
the
ramifications
of
the
decision
that
you
make,
and
the
situation
might
not
be
like
this
case,
and
it
might
be
that
the
intermediary
has
intentionally
covered
up
evidence,
and
then
on
the
181st
day
comes
out
and
announces
we
hid
this
from
you.
ms.
diana
l.
gustin
well,
i
believe
that
the
facts
in
our
case
are
sufficient
for
this
court
to
decide,
because
i
think
it
is
wrong
for
the
intermediary
to
have
a
salary
survey
that
they
know
about
that
we
do
not
know
about
and
not
use
it
when
they're
required
to
do
so
under
law.
i
think
that's
certainly
a
strong
enough
case
for
this
court,
and
the
only
way
that
we
discovered
this
is
when
we
hired
a
cpa
who
had
represented
other
clients
and
had
seen
the
salary
survey
used
for
those
other
clients,
so
by
independent
means
we
discovered
this.
the
intermediary
may
never
have
told
us.
we
may
never
have
been
able
to
find
out
that
they
were
doing
this,
and
i
think
that's
the
problem
with
the
situation
here.
the
intermediary
and
its
employees
can
do
anything,
and
as
long
as
we
don't
know
about
it
for
180
days,
they
can
violate
any
law,
and
if
they
refuse
to
reopen,
there
is
no
recourse
for
the--
ms.
diana
l.
gustin
--it's
not
a
perfect
world.
ms.
diana
l.
gustin
but
we're...
we're
satisfied
to
do
this
within
the
confines
of
the
secretary's
regulation
on
reopening,
the
3-year
period.
ms.
diana
l.
gustin
thank
you.
