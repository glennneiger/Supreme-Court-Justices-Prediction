in
any
of
those
cases,
was
the
new
argument
that
we
rejected
an
argument
to
the
effect
that
we
have
no
jurisdiction?
justice
antonin
scalia
is
that
because
that
may
not
be
a
jurisdictional
argument?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
think
you
have
to
make
that
point
because...
i
think
you
have
to
make
that
point
because
if
it
is
strictly
speaking
a
jurisdictional--
justice

--point,
not
only
do
we
have
to
entertain
it
if...
if
the
respondent
raises
it
here
for
the
first
time
or
the
petitioner,
indeed
we
have
to
entertain
it
on
our
own,
even
if
he
doesn't
raise
it

it

objection
based
upon

a
reflection
of
sovereign
immunity,
sovereign
immunity
is
normally
waivable,
isn't
it,
by
the
sovereign?
so,
i
mean,
it
may
be
jurisdictional,
but...
but
maybe
it's
a
peculiar...
it
has
to
be
a
peculiar
kind
of
jurisdiction.
