mr.

chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--mr.
evans,
do
you
think
the...
the
congress
could
cut
off
this
court's
appellate
jurisdiction,
say,
just
in
commerce
clause
cases?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
there's
some
earlier
eleventh
amendment
cases,
aren't
there,
reed
detective
and
that
indiana
case,
that
say
it
can
be
raised
here
for
the
first
time?
chief

william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
evans.
mr.
cooper?
chief

h.
rehnquist
you
don't
challenge
the
cohens
case
itself,
i
take
it.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
would
be
the
authority
for
the
united
states
to
bring
an
action
in
a
case
like
this
where
you're
talking
about
the
negative
commerce
clause?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
do
you
think
the
united
states
can
just
go
around
and
sue
a
state
whenever
it
feels
like
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
does
your...
does
your
doctrine
that
you're
espousing
now
have
a
ex
parte
young
exception
to
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
that
you
could
sue...
you
could
sue
the
alabama
revenue
commissioner
in...
in...
in
state
court
and
bring
that
suit
here
if
it
was
decided
against
you
on
a
federal
ground.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--thank
you,
mr.
cooper.
mr.
evans,
you
