you
don't
think
you
can
just
lay
back--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--from
the
standpoint
of
good
practice
and
not
tell
us
about
jurisdictional
issues.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
of
course,
those...
those
who
agreed
with
the
majority
position
did
so
on
the
assumption
that
the
supreme
court
had
jurisdiction.
if
that
assumption
were
to
change,
then
those
who
were
in
the
majority
in
mckesson
might
rethink
the
correctness
of
the
position
advanced
in
the
dissent.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
if
we're
going
to
be
fastidious
about
the
language
of
the
eleventh
amendment,
we'd
have
to
redo
a
lot
of
our
jurisprudence,
wouldn't
we?
