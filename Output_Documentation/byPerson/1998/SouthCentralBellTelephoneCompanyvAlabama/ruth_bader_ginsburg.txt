mr.
evans,
may
i
just--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--ask
to...
i...
i
take
it,
from
what
you've
said
so
far,
that...
that
justice
see
on
the
alabama
supreme
court
who
spoke
before
on
the
nine...
that
his
position
is
essentially
right.
is
that--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
that's
why
we
have
it
in
our
rules,
that
if
you
want
to
bring
it
up,
put
it
in
the
brief
in
opposition
and
not
for
the
first
time
in
the
respondents'
brief.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
cooper,
may
i
interrupt
you
with
this
point
to
read
from
a
unanimous
opinion
9
years
ago
with
which
you
are
no
doubt
familiar.
it
says,
the
eleventh
amendment
does
not
constrain
the
appellate
jurisdiction
of
the
supreme
court
over
cases
arising
from
state
courts.
period.
now,
that...
you
are
asking
us
to
overrule
a
unanimous
9-year-old
decision.
is
that
correct?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
may
i
ask
you
also
as
an
anterior
question,
do
we
take
it
that
you
are
not
pursuing
any
of
the...
the
questions
that
were
in...
raised
originally?
you
are...
you
are
not
defending
the
res
judicata
point
that
the
alabama
court
relied
on
and
you're
not
defending
their
analysis
of
the
discriminatory
tax.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
so,
if
we
don't...
if
we
don't
accept
these
new
arguments
you're
presenting
today,
then
you
agree
that
we
must
reverse
the...
the
judgment.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
cooper,
this
is...
this
is
the
problem,
as
i
see
it,
with
fair
notice.
one
could
hardly
anticipate
such
a
question
given
that
there
was
a
unanimous
decision
9
years
ago
addressing
precisely
that
question
and
rejecting
your
position.
so,
the
petitioner
could
hardly
expect
that
that
would
be
an
issue
in
this
case,
and
that's
why
this
is
so
troublesome,
that
you're
bringing
up
something
that
one
really
could
not
have
anticipated.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
not
this
particular
situation
of...
of
appellate
review
by
the
supreme
court.
this
was
not
just
a
offhand
statement.
this
is
a
very
heavily
footnoted,
5-page
discussion
of
the
issue,
citing
cases
going
back
to
martin
against
hunters
lessee.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
why
isn't
it
within
the
language
if
it's...
if
it's...
the
state
brings
the
proceeding,
but
the
person
who's
bringing
it
to
the
supreme
court
on
writ
of
error,
or
whatever
it
is,
is
going
against
the
state
at
that
point.
i
don't
understand
why
that
wouldn't--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--you
say,
oh,
and
the
language
in
one
case...
in
the
cohen
case,
the
language
covers
it.
in
the
case
where
the
parties
are
on
opposite
sides,
it
doesn't?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
they're
trying
to
get
it
back.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you're
saying
that
they
have
nothing...
nothing...
no
way
of
getting
back...
getting
a
refund.
this
is
a
suit
for
a
refund.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes,
but
whatever
alabama
says,
this
court
has
no...
and
it's
a
federal
question
that
we're
dealing
with.
alabama
will
be
the
final
word
on
that
federal
question
with
respect
to
outsiders.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
all
taxpayers
from
out-of-state.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
how...
how
many
years
was,
mr.
cooper,
this
case
in
litigation,
this
refund
claim?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes,
and
all
that
time
the
corporation
must
pay
the
tax,
and
on
your
ex
parte
young
theory,
maybe
there
could
be
a
prospective
relief,
but
for
all
those
10
years,
the
federal
court,
this
court,
is
unable
to
say
that
the
state
law
was
unconstitutional.
and
there's
no
remedy
at
all
for
10
years
of
unconstitutional
behavior
on
the
part
of
the
state.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
that
would
certainly
run
counter
to
justice
breyer's
reference
to
holmes
saying
it
wouldn't
matter
so
much
if
this
court
didn't
have
the
authority
to
declare
an
act
of
congress
unconstitutional,
but
if
it
lost
that
power
with
respect
to
state
laws,
the
union
would
be
something
quite
different
from
what
it
is.
