mr.
charles
j.
cooper
mr.
chief
justice...
excuse
me...
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
argument
that
has
preceded
me
has
crystallized,
i
think,
two
issues:
one
with
respect
to
our
eleventh
amendment
argument,
one
whether
or
not
it
is
appropriate
for
it
to
be
taken
up
and
considered
by
the
court
in
light
of
the
fact
that
it
was
not
mentioned
in
the
opposition
to
the
certiorari;
and
second,
if
it
is,
whether
it
has
merit.
this
court's
rule
15.2
says
that
we
may
waive
an
objection
based
upon
what
occurred
in
the
proceedings
below
if
the
objection
does
not
go
to
jurisdiction.
go
to
jurisdiction.
we
submit
to
the
court
that
the
eleventh
amendment
goes
to
the
jurisdiction
of
this
court.
just
a
little
over
2
years
ago,
this
court
in
seminole
tribe
said
that
the
eleventh
amendment
stands
for
the
constitutional
principle
that
state
sovereign
immunity
limited
the
federal
courts'
jurisdiction
under
article
ii.
the
court
has
repeatedly
stated
that
the
eleventh
amendment,
for
example,
in
the
ford
case
which
really
is
on
all
fours
with
our
circumstance
here,
the
ford
motor
case--
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
--that
is
accurate,
justice
ginsburg.
i
have
many
reasons
for
that
request
that
i...
that
i
will...
that
i
will
address,
but--
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
--justice
ginsburg,
that
is
accurate.
we
are
saying
that
the
commerce
clause
merits
argument
is
that
we...
we're
entitled
to
prevail
on
that
but
not
because
of
the
alabama
supreme
court's
correct
application
of
the
commerce
clause
precedents,
but
rather
because,
as
three
members
of
this
court
argued
not
long
ago,
the
dormant
commerce
clause
cases
are
not
well
considered,
and
the
court
should
carefully
reexamine
those
arguments
that
were
advanced
by
those--
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
--unless
some
member
of
this
court
can
think
of
a
different
argument,
justice
ginsburg,
for
upholding
the
alabama
supreme
court's
decision,
that
is
accurate.
our
premise
argument
however,
justice
ginsburg,
is
that
this
court
cannot
reach
the
merits
of
this
issue
because
of
the
eleventh
amendment.
and
again,
ford
motor
company,
which
i
think
the
chief
justice
was
referring
to
earlier,
the
indiana
case,
your
honor,
is
on,
we
believe,
all
fours
in
terms
of
the
ability
of
the
court
to
take
the
case
up.
there
the...
the
state
of
indiana
did
not
raise
the
eleventh
amendment
in
the
district
court.
it
didn't
raise
it
in
the
seventh
circuit.
it
didn't
raise
it
in
its
op
cert.
in
fact,
it
raised
it
in
its
merits
brief
because--
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
--if...
if
the...
if
this
is
not
a
jurisdictional
point,
if
this
issue
doesn't
go
to
jurisdiction,
then
the
court
could
certainly
exercise
its
discretion
not
to
reach
the
issue.
it's
our
submission,
justice
stevens,
that
the
eleventh
amendment
and
this
court's
consistent
understanding
and
application
of
it--
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
--not
at
all,
justice
breyer.
in
fact--
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
--well,
this...
this...
the
element--
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
--oh,
it's...
it
is
absolutely
our
argument,
justice
breyer.
our...
our
contention
is
not
that
the
alabama
supreme
court
was
barred
by
the
eleventh
amendment.
we
don't
have
a
problem
with
what...
what
took
place
below.
it
is
that
what
took
place
below,
the
adjudication
of
the
merits
of
the
issue,
can't
take
place
here.
that...
that
is
our
argument.
and
the
reason
it
can't
take
place...
so,
we
have
a
double
argument
under
the...
under
rule
15.2,
justice
breyer.
that's
point
number
one.
but
point
number
two
is
in
any
event,
the
eleventh
amendment
goes
to
jurisdiction.
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
no,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
no,
your
honor.
we
regret
that
this
point
was
not
mentioned
in
the
opposition
to
certiorari.
it
would
have
been
better
practice
if
it
had
been.
the
part
of
the
rule,
however,
that
goes
to
and
alerts
counsel
to
the
possibility
of
waiving
an
argument
speaks
to
jurisdiction
and
it
speaks
to
objections
based
upon
what
occurred
below.
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
and
with
all
due
respect,
we
maintain
that
this
court
actually
doesn't
have
discretion
in
a
jurisdictional
argument
that
is
waived...
that
is
asserted
to
the
court
to...
to
not
reach
the
issue.
again--
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
--your
honor,
all
i
can
say
is
that
the
issue,
again,
goes
to
jurisdiction.
the
question
is
whether
or
not...
i
think
there
are
two
different
questions,
whether
it
would
have
been
better
practice,
and
certainly
it
would
have,
to
have
mentioned
this
in
the
opposition
to
certiorari.
the
issue
had
been
spotted
that
in
fact
what
we
have
in
this
case
is
a
suit
in
which...
that
was
commenced
by
the
petitioners,
none
of
whom
are
citizens
of
alabama,
against
the
state
of
alabama
and
its
department
of
revenue,
state
defendants.
and
if
this
court
exercises...
does
reach
the
merits,
it
will
be
exercising
the
judicial
power
of
the
united
states.
the
case
is
squarely
within
the
very
letter
of
the
eleventh
amendment,
and
it
is
our
respectful
submission
to
the
court
that
the
mckesson
case,
for
a
number
of
reasons,
was
simply
wrong.
in
fact--
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
--your
honor,
sovereign
immunity
can
be
waived,
but
this
court's
decisions
have
clearly
stated
that
sovereign
immunity
must
be
waived
in
the
most
unequivocal
way,
that--
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
--you're
referring
to
mckesson?
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
well,
justice
ginsburg,
since
that
case
was
decided,
the
seminole
tribe
case
has
been
decided,
and
four
members
of
this
court
characterized
the
reasoning
in
mckesson
as
being
specious,
particularly
in
light
of
the
seminole
tribe
case.
and
i
would--
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
--yes,
your
honor,
but
if
there
is
federal
question
jurisdiction,
if...
if...
if
the
eleventh
amendment
does,
indeed,
bar
a
federal
question
case,
that
is,
a
case
as
in
seminole
brought
by
a
citizen
of
the
state
against
the
state,
then
the
court's
analysis...
or
the
dissenting
justices'
analysis
in
seminole
tribe,
it
seems
to
us,
is
precisely
correct.
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
might
as
well,
your
honor,
and
it
may
well
be
that
here
my
argument
is
focused
more
specifically
on
the
five
members
of
the
court
in
the...
in
the
majority
in
seminole
tribe.
but
mckesson,
justice
ginsburg,
while
it
was
a
unanimous
decision,
was
premised
upon...
its
central
linchpin
was
the
cohens
case,
and
it...
it
is
simply
based,
we
respectfully
submit,
on
a
serious
misreading
of
the
cohens
case.
that
case
involved--
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
--no,
not
at
all,
your
honor.
it
seems
that
the
cohens
case,
your
honor,
is...
is
quite
correct.
it
simply
stands
for
the
proposition
that
a...
when
a
state
commences
a
suit
against
an
individual,
that
is
not
a...
an
individual
commencing
a
suit
against
the
state.
and
so,
it's
not
within
the
language
of
the
eleventh
amendment,
number
one.
it's
not
within
the
purpose
of
the
eleventh
amendment.
a
state
doesn't
need
immunity
to--
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
--your
honor--
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
--your
honor,
chief
justice
marshall
examined
that
very
issue
at
length.
in
fact,
we've
excerpted
on
page
19
of
our
briefing
the
analysis
of...
of
the
court
in
cohens
that
went
to
that
issue.
and
the...
the
central
point
is
that
a
suit
for
purposes
of
the
eleventh
amendment
is
a
judicial
proceeding
instituted
by
an
individual
that
seeks
some
demand
upon
the
state,
some
demand
upon
the
state.
and
that
character
doesn't
change
when
a
writ
of
error
is
taken
to
this
court
to
review
a
decision.
the...
the
individual
is
still
seeking
a
demand
upon
the
state.
so--
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
--if...
if
the
state
itself
is
the
party
defendant--
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
--as
opposed
to
an
officer
of
the
state.
and,
your
honor,
in
this
very
case,
the
commissioner
of
revenue
was
a
party
until
the
case
went
to
the
alabama
supreme
court.
he
was
dropped
out
at
that
stage,
and
this
court
could
have
considered
this
very
decision...
this
very
case
had
the
commissioner
remained
in
under
this
court's
decisions
in
the
ex
parte
young.
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
i
do
not
think
it
would
be,
justice
stevens.
i
think
whether
or
not
the
commissioner
is
a
party
to
this
suit
as
a
defendant
depends
upon
whether
he
was
a
party
in
the
alabama
supreme
court
under
this
court's
rules.
and
it
is
clear
from
a
case
called
sperau,
which
we
cite
and
discuss
in
footnote
1
of
our
briefing,
that...
that
when
the
commissioner
was
not
named
in
the
notice
of
appeal
from
the
circuit
court
of
montgomery
county
to
the
appellate
courts,
that
the
commissioner
was
no
longer
a
party.
the
court
there
said
it
is
settled
law
that
a
notice
of
appeal
from
a
judgment
in
favor
of
two
or
more
parties
must
specifically
name
each
party
whose
judgment
the
appellant
wishes
to
overturn.
and
this--
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
--yes.
yes,
your
honor,
under
ex
parte
young.
and--
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
--no.
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
no,
justice
scalia,
but
they
can
certainly
prevent
it
from
going
forward,
and
that's
the
purpose
of
ex
parte
young.
the
question
here
i
guess
would
be--
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
--oh,
i'm
obviously
trying
to
prevent
its
payment,
your
honor.
i
represent
the
state.
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
well
but,
your
honor,
they...
they--
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
--not
just
to
get
it
back.
they
also
sought
injunctive
relief
to
prevent
the
collection
in
the
future
of
this
tax,
and
that,
justice
stevens,
would
be
a
case
that
if
the
commissioner
were
still
in
this--
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
--well,
they...
they...
they
have
the
alabama
court
system
for
getting
back
a
refund.
the
question
is
whether
or
not--
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
--with
respect
to
this
suit,
yes,
justice
ginsburg.
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
well,
but
i...
i
want
to
hasten
to
note,
as
the
court
pointed
out
in
seminole
tribe,
that
there
are...
there
are
several
methods
where
ongoing
violations
of
the...
of
the
constitution,
if
that's
what
this
is,
can
be
prevented.
the
united
states
can
bring
an
action.
an
ex
parte
young
action
can
be
brought.
the
congress
can
decide
to
abrogate
the
state's
sovereign
immunity.
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
well,
your
honor,
i...
i
think
that...
i
don't
have
a
case
to
cite
the
court
that
the
united
states
would
have
authority
on
that
score,
but
at
least
broadly
considered,
the
united
states
can
sue
a
state
and
there's
no...
there's
no
eleventh
amendment
problem
to
this
court's
jurisdiction
over
that.
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
oh,
no.
no,
your
honor.
that's...
that
is
not
my
submission.
but...
but
i
think
the
key
point
here
is
that
ex
parte
young
would...
would
provide
the
taxpayers
relief
with
respect
to
going
forward.
but--
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
--your
honor,
i
think...
i
think
that
the
court
need
not...
if
you're
speaking
about
rule
15.2,
i
believe
the
court
can
apply
its
rule
and...
and
reach
the
eleventh
amendment.
that
is
our
submission.
i
do
also
believe,
however,
that
yes,
it
is
true
that
mckesson
was
wrongly
decided.
the
court
should
reexamine
it,
and...
and
it
should
overrule
it.
your
honor,
sovereign
immunity...
inherent,
justice
ginsburg--
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
--once
again,
justice
o'connor,
the
eleventh
amendment
argument
is
a
constitutional
one.
it
is
a
jurisdictional
one,
and
it
is
our
respectful
submission
to
the
court
that
the
state
can
raise
this
in
its...
in
its
merits
briefs.
by
no
means
did
it
waive
its
sovereign
immunity
in
this...
in
this
case.
and,
justice
ginsburg,
with
respect
to
the
notion
that...
that
the
petitioners
here
would
have
no
federal
avenue
of
appellate
review,
inherent
in
the
notion
of
sovereign
immunity
is...
and
inherent
in
the
notion
of
the
eleventh
amendment
is
that
the
federal
courts
are
precluded
from
taking
jurisdiction
over
a
case
brought
against
non-citizens
against
the
state
itself.
and
this
is
a
case
against
the
state
itself.
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
well,
that's
the
hans
case,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
well,
justice
breyer,
i
think
that
the
point
i
would
make
to
you
is
that
if
chisolm,
in
chisolm
against
georgia,
had
advanced
a
federal
cause
of
action,
i
don't
think
that
the
state's
reaction
would
have
been
any
different.
it
would
have...
the
general
alarm
that
swept
the...
the
country
when
the
supreme
court
took
jurisdiction
over
that
state
law
claim
against
the
state
would
not
have...
i
would
submit
to
you
would
not
have
been
different
if
a
federal
constitutional
claim
had
been
included
in
it.
and,
in
fact,
the...
the
congress
and
the
ratifiers
of
the
eleventh
amendment
would
have
used
exactly
the
same
words
in
order
to
reach
what
happened
there.
this...
this
court's--
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
--well--
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
--two
points,
your
honor.
first,
that
the...
this
court
has
recognized
that
a...
a
state's
waiver
of
its
own
state
sovereign
immunity
in
its
own
courts
doesn't...
in
atascadero,
the
court
made
clear
that
the
waiver
of
sovereign...
of
the
eleventh
amendment
must
be
specifically
worded.
so,
alabama's
waiver
here
does
not
include
a
waiver
of
its
eleventh
amendment
because
it
doesn't
mention
the
federal...
the
federal
court.
and
the...
as
i
say,
in
the
chisolm
case,
the...
if...
if
there
had
been
a
contract
clause
or...
and
that
was
an
original
action.
but,
your
honor--
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
--that's...
that's...
that's
essentially
it,
your
honor.
but...
but
i
think
the
court's
focus
on...
on...
on
chisolm
is...
or
at
least
on
the
origins
of
the
eleventh
amendment
is...
is...
is
well
taken.
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
your
honor--
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
no.
thank
you,
justice
stevens.
i
think
that's
an
important
amendment.
i
think
ex
parte
young
only
goes
as
far
as
ex
parte
young,
but
i
think
it's
available
to
the
petitioners
in
this
case
and
it
would...
and
it
would
allow
the
case
to
be
brought
to
this
court
as
an
at
least--
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
--your
honor,
the...
the
refund
claim
i
think
was
in
the
alabama
court
somewhere
on
the
order
of
a
decade.
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
your
honor,
i
think
that's...
i
think
that
is
the
consequence,
the
unavoidable
consequence,
of
sovereign
immunity.
i
think
that
is
inherent
in
the
notion
of
sovereign
immunity.
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
your
honor,
the...
the
language
of
the
eleventh
amendment,
its...
its
very
letter,
does
not
contemplate
this
exception.
it
says
the
judicial
power
of
the
united
states.
when
this
court
reaches
the
merits
of
this
case,
it
will
be
exercising
the
judicial
power
of
the
united
states.
the
eleventh
amendment
specifically
and
precisely
enjoins
this
court
from
construing
the
judicial
power
of
the
united
states
to
extend
to
a
suit
commenced
by
these
petitioners,
non-citizens
of
alabama,
against
alabama.
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
well,
your
honor,
i
think
that...
my
answer,
justice
kennedy,
is
this.
never
has
this
court
cut
back
on
the
eleventh
amendment.
in
fact,
every
time
it
has
recognized
that
the
letter
of
the
eleventh
amendment
doesn't
exhaust
the
protections
of
the
eleventh
amendment,
it
has
extended
it,
such
as
in
hans,
to
citizens
of
a
state,
such
as
in
monaco,
to
foreign
nations.
how
is
it...
how
can
it
be
that
in
seminole
tribe
that
a
case
that
is
not
within
the
letter
of
the
eleventh
amendment,
brought
by
citizens
of
the
state
of
florida,
and
despite--
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
--your
honor,
i
think
cohen
is
a
very
difficult
road
for
that
argument.
a
writ
of
error
in
that
case
wasn't
a
suit
because
it
was...
because
the
suit
had
been
commenced
by
the
state
against
the
individual.
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
and...
and--
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
--oh,
yes.
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
your
honor,
i
think
chief
justice
marshall
in
cohens
made
clear
that
the...
that...
and
that
was
a
case
that
came
up
out
of
the
state--
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
--appellate
system.
and...
and...
and
if
it
was
as
easy
as
nothing
that
happens
in
the
state
constitutes
a
suit,
then--
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
--within
the
meaning
of
the
eleventh
amendment,
then
a
very
short
opinion.
but
justice...
but
chief
justice
marshall
analyzed
at
great
length
what
a
suit
is,
and
he
said
it's
any
proceeding
brought
in
a
court
of
law,
court
of
justice,
which
included,
presumably,
the
courts
of
virginia,
by
a
non-citizen.
so,
your
honor,
i
think...
i
think
it
would
be
a
very
strange,
with
all
due
respect,
interpretation
of
the
word
suit
to
suggest
that
the
framers
and
the
ratifiers
of
the
eleventh
amendment
didn't
contemplate
at
all
a
suit
coming
to
the
courts
through
the
appellate
route
as
opposed
to
initially
instituted
in
the
federal
court
route.
in
fact,
presumably,
the
federal
courts
of
appeals
could
be
authorized
to
review
state
supreme
court
decisions
if...
if...
if
that
view
is
correct.
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
well,
this--
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
--but
surely
not
when
the
state
is--
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
--when
the
state
itself
is
a
defendant.
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
yes.
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
your
honor,
i...
my
time
is
about
expired
and
obviously
i
have
little
time
left
to
devote
to
our...
our
respectful
request
that
the
court
reexamine
this
court's
negative
commerce
clause
jurisprudence.
we
have
nothing
to
add
to
the
treatment
that
was
provided
by
justice
thomas
in
his
dissenting
opinion
not...
not
long
ago
in
the...
in
the
camps
newfound
case
on
the
merits
of
that
point.
but
i
would
like
very
briefly
to
address
the
issue
of
stare
decisis
and
the...
thank
you,
your
honor.
