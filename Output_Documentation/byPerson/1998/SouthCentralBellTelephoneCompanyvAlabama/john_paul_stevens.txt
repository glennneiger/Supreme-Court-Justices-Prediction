mr.
evans,
what
are
the
two
cases
you
were
saying
where
we
had
done
this
before?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
also
to
give
notice
to
the
amicus.
justice
john
paul
stevens
of
course,
we've
changed
our
rules
on
what
the
brief
in
opposition
has
to
include
since
the
city
of
tuttle...
oklahoma
city
against
tuttle
i
think.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
a
better
practice
under
rule
15
under
the
previous
part
of
the
rule,
two
sentences
previous
as
to
what
justice
breyer
quoted,
is
for
you
to
notify
the
court
what
issues
are
properly
before
us,
including
jurisdictional
issues.
justice
john
paul
stevens
your
view
of...
just
to
kind
of...
your
view
is
that
any
proceeding
in
a
state
court
brought
against
the
state
by
a
citizen
of
another
state
could
never
be
reviewed
by
this
court.
justice
john
paul
stevens
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
would
the
respondent
have...
would
it
be
within
the
judicial
power
of
this
court
to
grant
a
motion
by
the
respondent
at
this
stage
of
the
proceedings
to
add
that
individual
as
a
defendant
in
order
to
preserve
the
jurisdiction
and
review?
justice
john
paul
stevens
let
me
go
back
a
second.
i
understand
your
response
to
that
and
i
think
it's
probably
correct.
but
does
it...
what
is
your
view
of
suing
individuals
in
their
official
capacity,
with
the
eleventh
amendment
as
usually
taken,
to
bar
such
a
suit?
can
they...
could...
could
under
your
view
an
out-of-state
plaintiff
avoid
the
eleventh
amendment
problem,
when
it's
thinking
it
may
need
review
in
this
court
ultimately,
by
suing
state
officials
in
their
official
capacity?
justice
john
paul
stevens
for
refund?
for
refund,
is
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
cooper,
the
issue
i
suppose,
even
on
the
letter,
is
whether
this
is
a
suit
within
the
meaning
of
the
eleventh
amendment,
and
that's
the
answer
justice
marshall
gave.
the
writ
of
error
was
not
a
suit.
and
you
could
similarly,
it
would
seem
to
me,
say
that
a
proceeding
in
state
court
is
not
a
suit
within
the
meaning
of
that
provision
because
that's
dealing
primarily
with
original
federal
actions.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
understand.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
it's
still
a
key
to
your
argument
that
we
read
the
word
suit
to
refer
to
the
state
proceeding
because--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--the
petition
for
cert
isn't
a
suit.
so...
and...
and
it
seems
to
me
one
could
conceivably
say
they
were
thinking
about
actions
originated
in
a
federal
court,
and
that's
the
kind
of
suit
that
is
referred
to
in
that...
in
that
provision.
that's
consistent
with
what
chief
justice
marshall
said.
and
incidentally,
we
don't
just
have
to
overrule
mckesson.
we've
got
overrule
all
the
cases
in
the
footnote
he
cited
too.
there
are
about
30
of
them
there.
justice
john
paul
stevens
correct.
justice
john
paul
stevens
within
the
meaning
of
the
eleventh
amendment.
