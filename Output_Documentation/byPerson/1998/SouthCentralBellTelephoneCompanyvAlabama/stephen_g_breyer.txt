justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
i
don't
see
why...
why
is
it
inappropriate
to
raise
this?
what
he's
raised
in
the
commerce
clause
is
an
argument
he
couldn't
really
raise
before
this
court.
i
mean,
the
argument
previously
was
whether
or
not
the
commerce
clause
jurisprudence
was
properly
applied,
and...
and
now
he
agrees
that
alabama
was
wrong.
they
didn't
apply
it
properly.
but
he's
saying
that
the
cases
of
this
court
which
set
it
forth
are
wrong
and
we
should
overturn
them.
well,
i
don't
it's
fair
to
ask
him
to
have
raised
that
before
the
lower
court--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
don't
understand
your
rule
actually.
i
mean,
this
is...
can
you
explain?
the
copy
i
have,
which
may
be...
it
says,
any
objection...
any
objection
to
consideration
of
a
question
presented,
based
on
what
occurred
in
the
proceeding
below,
if
the
objection
does
not
go
to
jurisdiction,
may
be
deemed
waived.
i
take
it
yours
is
not
an
objection
based
on
what
occurred
in
the
proceeding
below.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
then
this
rule
doesn't
cover
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
that
an
argument?
i
don't
know.
i
haven't
focused
on
this
rule.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
understand.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
once
you
hold
that...
once
you
say
that,
you
know...
once
you
treat
the
eleventh
amendment
as
including
citizens
of
a
state
against
a
state,
which
i
take
it
we
have
to
read
into
it...
right?
isn't
that
so?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
all
right.
so...
so
then
could...
is
it
reasonable
that
the
thing...
if
we
accepted
your
view
of
the
statute
that
this
applies
to
the
supreme
court,
cases
coming
out
of
the
state
courts,
then
wouldn't
there
have
been
a
large
subset
of
cases
where
it
would
have
been
impossible
or
difficult
to
enforce
a
uniform
federal
law
striking
down
unconstitutional
state
statutes,
that
power
that
holmes
thought
was
absolutely
essential
to
create
a
federal
nation?
i...
i
think
if
your...
if
your
view
had
been
adopted
back
then
and
we
had
hans,
there
would
have
been
a
whole
subset
of
potential
unconstitutional
state
laws
that
it
would
have
been
impossible
for
the...
or
state
laws
that
conflict
with
the
federal
statute,
that
it
would
have
been
impossible
or
difficult
for
the
supreme
court
ever
to
reach.
so,
you
would
have
had
that.
now,
is...
now,
you're
going
to
deny
that,
and
i'm
very
interested
in
your
reasoning.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
only
way
it
could
have
reached
the
supreme
court
would
be
if
the
states
basically
had
waived
their
sovereign
immunity
within
their
own
courts.
right?
otherwise,
the
issue
couldn't
have
come
up.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
if
it
had
come
up
in
that
form,
what
would
have
been
the
objection
to
the
supreme
court
hearing
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so,
your
answer
to
me
is,
well,
the
eleventh
amendment
does
create
such
a
subset
of
cases.
all
the
state
has
to
do
is
keep
out
of
the
courts.
and...
and
this
doesn't
make
matters
that
much
worse.
that's
the
answer.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
they
are
actually
in
some
instances.
in
the
fdic
area--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--there
were
some.
in
the
fdic
area,
there...
when...
a
federal
takeover
of
a
bank,
there
is
appellate
jurisdiction.
i've
had
them.
we
had
those
cases.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
it
was
tried
in
the
state
court,
tried
in
the
state
court,
and
they
got
their
appeal
over
to
the
federal
appeals
court.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
in
that
case.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i...
it
didn't--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
second
case
which
is
not
about
tires
is
the
south
central
bell
telephone
company
versus
the
state
of
alabama.
that
case
has
to
do
with
a
franchise
tax
on
corporations.
alabama
calculates
its
state
tax
differently
depending
on
whether
the
corporation
at
issue
is
a
foreign
i.e.
a
non-alabama
corporation
or
domestic
alabama
corporation
and
the
basic
question
before
us
in
that
case
is
whether
in
light
of
the
difference
the
franchise
tax
on
the
foreign
corporation
violates
the
commerce
clause.
our
holding
is
it
does
violate
the
commerce
clause.
before
we
reach
that
question
on
the
merit,
however,
we
have
to
decide
whether
the
eleventh
amendment
bars
our
consideration
of
the
case
because
the
eleventh
amendment
says
that
the
federal
judicial
powers
doesn't
extend
to
a
suit
brought
against
the
state
by
citizens
of
another
state.
now,
alabama
points
out
that
this
case
is
a
suit
brought
by
citizens
of
another
state
against
this
state
and
it
before
this
got
to
this
court
it
was
only
in
the
state
courts.
nonetheless
this
court
has
previously
held
that
the
eleventh
amendment
does
not
prevent
this
court
from
reviewing
state
court
lawsuits
where
the
state
is
a
party
whether
it
is
the
plaintiff
or
it
is
the
defendant
and
we
reject
alabama's
eleventh
amendment
claim
primarily
on
the
basis
of
that
precedent.
we
also
have
to
decide
a
preliminary
matter
whether
alabama's
courts
could
have
ruled
in
favor
of
the
state
mistakes
for
a
special
reason.
there
have
been
an
earlier
case,
state
courts
might
have
said
it
was
somewhat
ambivalent
on
this,
rather
elliptical
that
the
eason
that
stated
one
because
of
the
principles
of
res
judicator,
and
we
have
to
decide
is
that
a
proper
ground.
there
is
an
earlier
case
decided
by
this
court
that
goes
into
that
matter
in
some
detail
and
basically
we
reject
that
the
claim
on
the
basis
of
that
earlier
cases.
the
parties
in
the
second
case
were
strangers
to
the
earlier
law
suit
and
the
fourteenth
amendment
prevents
a
state
from
stop
a
firm
from
using
rec
judicator
to
bar
the
estrangers.
so,
we
finally
get
to
the
merits
and
we
note
that
alabama
measures
its
tax
on
domestic
corporations
by
the
power
value
of
the
corporation
stock.
a
number
that
the
corporation
can
easily
reduce
if
it
wants,
well
below
any
actual
market
value.
but
when
it
measure
the
tax
on
foreign
corporations,
it
does
so
by
the
value
of
the
capital
the
foreign
corporation
actually
implies
in
alabama
as
determined
by
certain
balance
sheet
numbers
that
the
corporation
cannot
easily
reduce.
now,
that
difference
significantly
discriminates
against
non
alabama
corporations.
in
our
view
it
is
not
justified
and
under
our
case
law
the
resulting
discrimination
makes
the
tax
unconstitutional.
the
state
argued
that
we
should
reconsider
and
abandoned
our
earlier
case
law
in
particular
our
long
standing
negatives
commerce
clause
jurisprudents.
but
the
state
did
not
make
clear
it
intended
to
make
any
such
sweeping
arguments
when
it
filed
it
opposition
to
the
petitions
for
certiorari
and
therefore
we
do
not
consider
that
far
reaching
claim.
for
those
reasons
we
reverse
the
decision
of
the
alabama
supreme
court.
we
remand
the
case
for
further
proceedings.
justice
o'connor
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion
and
justice
thomas
has
also
filed
a
different
concurring
opinion.
