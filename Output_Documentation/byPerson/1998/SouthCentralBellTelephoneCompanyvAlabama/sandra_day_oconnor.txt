but
in
any
event,
for...
for
you
to
prevail
here,
i
guess
we
would
have
to
overturn
mckesson
and
ignore
our
own
rule
as
a
minimum.

o'connor
this
is
the
kind
of
argument
that
one
would
certainly
hope
that
amici
would
focus
on
and
be
interested
in.
nobody
had
a
clue
it
was
going
to
be
raised
until
your
remarkable
brief
appeared
here
in
this
court.
