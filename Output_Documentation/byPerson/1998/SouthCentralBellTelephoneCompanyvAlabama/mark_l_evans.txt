mr.
mark
l.
evans
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
after
this
court
granted
certiorari
in
this
case,
respondents
adopted
a
surprising
strategy.
in
their
brief
on
the
merits,
they
refused
to
address
the
two
issues
on
which
the
court
granted
review
and
instead
offered
up
lengthy
arguments
on
issues
that
the
court
had
not
agreed
to
review
and,
in
fact,
arguments
that
respondents
had
not
made
or
mentioned
in
their
brief
in
opposition.
and
then
in
yet
another
surprise
about
2
weeks
ago,
respondents
later
withdrew
one
of
those
three
arguments
in
their...
in
their
merits
brief.
barring
another
surprise
today,
therefore,
what
we
are
left
with
are
two
arguments,
neither
of
which
can
succeed
unless
the
court
is
prepared
to
overrule
a
very
large
number
of
its
eleventh
amendment
and
commerce
clause
precedents.
to
bring
the
case
rather
briefly
back
to
where
it
started,
the
court
granted
certiorari
to
consider
two
questions:
one
involving
alabama's
use
of
res
judicata
as
a
bar
against
a
constitutional
challenge
to
an
alabama
state
tax
brought
by
taxpayers
who
were
complete
strangers
to
the
prior
judgment
that
was
asserted
as
a
bar,
and
the
second
involving
the
lawfulness
of
alabama's
franchise
tax
under
this
court's
commerce
clause
precedents.
now,
although
respondents
put
up
a
defense
on
both
of
these
issues
in
their
brief
in
opposition,
they
obviously
chose
not
to
do
so
again
in
their
merits
brief.
and
i
think
i
can
understand
why.
it's
because
both
issues
are
controlled
by
this
court's
recent
and
frequently
unanimous
precedents.
the
due
process
in
our
case
is
a
near...
in
our...
in
our
judgment
is
a
near
clone
of
richards
against
jefferson
county,
which
was
decided
less
than
3
years
ago
by
a
unanimous
court
in
another
case
that
came
from
alabama.
and
the
commerce
clause
question
is
controlled
by
fulton
against
faulkner
and
in
another
recent
commerce
clause
decisions
of
this
court
that
have
condemned
facially
discriminatory
taxes
and
that
have
narrowed
the
complementary
tax
doctrine.
i
don't
think
i
will
belabor
these
points
because
they
are
not
contested
at
this
point,
but
as
we
explained
in
our
brief,
the
alabama
franchise
tax
is
unlawfully
discriminatory
because
it
taxes
alabama
corporations
based
on
the
par
value
of
their
capital
stock,
a
figure
that
they
are
utterly
free
to
set
and
adjust
as
they
wish
without
any
effect
on
their
business
operations.
but
it
taxes
out-of-state
corporations
based
on
the
capital
actually
employed
in
the
state,
in
other
words,
based
on
their
business
operations
in
alabama.
in
our
view
there's
no...
no
need
to
look
any
further
because
any
tax
that
allows
in-state
corporations
to,
in
effect,
determine
their
own
tax
liability
and
not
out-of-state
corporations
is
facially
discriminatory.
in
their
merits
brief
in
this
court,
respondents
obviously
have
abandoned
their
defense
on
both
of
these
issues,
and
they've
raised
three
new
issues,
one
involving
the
jurisdiction
of
the
alabama
state
courts,
one
challenging
this
court's
appellate
authority
under
the
eleventh
amendment,
and
one
attacking
the
entire
body
of
this
court's
negative
commerce
clause
jurisprudence.
the
first
of
these
issues
need
not
concern
the
court
any
longer
because
2
weeks
ago
mr.
cooper
wrote
a
letter
to
the
clerk
withdrawing
his
jurisdiction
argument
and
acknowledging
that
it
was
in
error.
and
in
our
view--
mr.
mark
l.
evans
--yes.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
yes,
exactly
right.
justice
see
actually...
just...
just
one
minor
correction...
spoke
for
three
with
another
who
did
not
join
the
opinion
but...
but
also
dissented.
in
our
view,
the
court
need
not
reach
any
of
the
other
issues
that...
either
of
the
other
issues
that
respondents
raise
here
because
they've
waived
those
arguments
by
not
presenting
them
in
their
brief
in
opposition.
but
if
the
court
does
reach
the
issues,
we
believe
the
court
should
reject
both
of
these
arguments.
both
ask
the
court
to
overrule
rafts
of
its
own
precedents
without
any
serious
justification
in
our
view.
the
eleventh
amendment
theory
is
that
in
actions
brought
against
the
state
in
state
court
with
the
state's
consent,
this
court
has
no
constitutional
power
at
the
end
of
the...
the
end
of
the
process
to
review
a
resulting
state
court
judgment
raising
federal
questions
and...
and
deciding
them
in
the
favor
of...
in
favor
of
the
state.
but
that
issue
was
unanimously
resolved
against
respondents'
position
just
9
years
ago
in
mckesson,
and
respondents
have
provided
no
good
reason
to
revisit
it.
and
in
their
negative
commerce
clause
argument,
the
respondents
ask
the
court
to
nullify
a
principle
the
court
has
embraced
for
at
least
a
century
and
a
half
and
that
has
engendered
enormous
reliance
throughout
the
nation's
economy.
and
moreover,
they
ask
the
court
to
do
this
in
the
least
controversial
aspect
of
the
negative
commerce
clause,
one
that
invalidates
state
laws
that...
that
facially
discriminate
against
interstate
commerce.
as
we
explain
in
our
reply
brief,
there
is
simply
no
reason
to
do
either
of
these
things.
neither
of
the
doctrines
that
we're
talking
about
were
announced
and
splintered
or
badly
reasoned
opinions
that
reflected
departure
from
established
precedent.
neither
has
proved
unworkable.
some
members
of
the
court
have
questioned
what
they
view
as
excesses
in
the
application
of
the
negative
commerce
clause,
but
even
those
members
have
regularly
expressed
a
willingness
to
continue
to
apply
the
core
principle
of
anti-discrimination.
and
finally,
it's
not
insignificant
that
congress
has
power
to
alter
the
effects
of
both
of
these
jurisprudential
principles.
under
the
negative
commerce
clause,
they
can
exercise
authority
to
permit
the
states
to
do
what
respondents
here
would
like
to
be
able
to
do,
and
even
under
article
iii,
congress
could
restrict
this
court's
appellate
authority
if
it
felt
it
was
appropriate
to
do
so.
and
the
court's
precedents
have
repeatedly
made
clear
that
stare
decisis
has
extra
force
where
congress
can
itself
make
changes
in
the
court's
decisions.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
i...
i
don't
know
the
answer
to
that,
and
it's
clearly
not
something
we
need
to
worry
about
at
the
moment.
but
i
think
it
would
raise
an
interesting
question,
and
it
may
well
be
able
to
do
that
under...
under
its
commerce
clause
authority.
it
would
be
an
interesting
question
i
think
constitutionally
whether
that
is
appropriate
or
not.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
that's
for
sure.
this...
one
of
the
things
that
i've
noticed
recently,
in
this
term
even,
is
that
the
court
has
repeatedly
refused
to
consider
arguments
raised
by
respondents
as
alternative
grounds
for
affirmance
that
have
not
been
preserved,
sometimes
invoking
rule
15.2,
sometimes
not.
and
the
most
recent
was
in
el
al
airlines
just
last
week
where
the
court
declined
to
consider
an
argument
that
was
not
presented
in
the
brief
in
opposition.
earlier
this
term,
there
was
a
case
called
knowles.
so,
from
the
point
of
view
of
petitioners,
the
court
should
not
address
either
of
these
new
arguments
that
have
been
made
by
respondents,
but
should
simply
decide
the
questions
on
which
it
granted
certiorari,
reject
the
arguments
that
respondents
made
in
their
brief
in
opposition
on
those
grounds,
reverse
the
judgment,
and
remand
it
for
provision
of
appropriate
relief
consistent
with
the
court's
precedents.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
there
are
cases,
justice
scalia,
in
which...
at
least
two
cases
in
which
the
court
has
recently
said
that
if
a
state
does
not
raise
an
eleventh
amendment
argument,
it
need
not
be
considered.
and
in
one
case,
patsy--
mr.
mark
l.
evans
--well,
that's
right.
it
has...
it
has...
as
the
court
has
put
it,
it
partakes
of
jurisdiction
in
the
sense
that
it
can
be
raised
later
in
the
process
than
at
the
first
instance,
but
it
is
not
jurisdictional
in
the
sense
that
the
court
must
consider
it
on
its
own
motion.
and
in...
in
fact,
in
patsy,
where
the
argument
was
raised
in
a
brief
in
opposition
but
not
pursued
in
the
merits
brief,
the
court
felt
no
obligation
to
consider
it.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
yes.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
i...
i
fully
agree.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
it
can
be
raised
here
for
the
first
time,
and
i'm
not
suggesting
anything
to
the
contrary,
but
it
needs
to
be
raised
properly.
and
here,
where
in...
in
these
more...
in
patsy
where
it
was
not
raised
properly
in
the
merits
brief,
even
though
it
had
been
raised
here,
the
court
felt
no
obligation
to
consider
it.
here,
what
i
think
is
even
worse,
it
was
not
signaled
to
the
court
in
the
brief
in
opposition,
but
showed
up
for
the
first
time
in
the
merits
brief.
certainly
a
respondent
could
not
come
here
and
make
an
argument
for
the
first
time
in
oral
argument.
there's
some
requirement
of
propriety
about
when
something
must
be
presented,
and
this
court
has
every
reason
to
disregard
an
argument
that
shows
up
for
the
very
first
time
in
the
brief
on
the
merits.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
the
case
called
knowles,
k-n-o-w-l-e-s,
which
was
decided
earlier
this
term,
footnote
2,
which
refused
to
consider
an
alternative
argument
presented
for
the
first
time
in
the
merits
brief
and
not
in
the
brief
in
opposition,
and
el
al
airlines,
which
again
was
not
preserved
in
the...
where
the
argument
was
not
preserved
in
the
merits
brief,
and
that
was
in
footnote
10
of
that
decision.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
and
i'm
not...
justice
breyer,
i'm
not
asking
that
they
do...
that
the
respondents
have
any
obligation
to
do
that.
if
they
want
to
present
that
argument
here--
mr.
mark
l.
evans
--they
can.
but
they
do
have
an
obligation
to
present
it
in
their
brief
in
opposition,
in
part,
to
give
notice
to
petitioners
so
that
we
can
consider
briefing
the
issue
in
the
opening
brief,
but
more
importantly,
for
this
court's
control
of
its
own
docket,
to
know
what
it
is
buying
into
when
it
grants
certiorari.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
and
to
the
amici,
absolutely.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
that's
right,
justice
ginsburg.
unless
the
court
has
further
questions,
at
this
point
i
will
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
just
three
very
quick
points.
mr.
cooper
has
referred
to
seminole's...
the
opinion
in
seminole
as
suggesting
that
there
are
other
routes
to
raise
federal
issues.
the
footnote
i
believe
he
is
referring
to
is
footnote
14,
and
the
three
items
that
are
mentioned
are
a
suit
by
the
united
states,
an
ex
parte
young
action,
and
then
i'd
like
to
just
quote
this
language.
and
this
court
is
empowered
to
review
a
question
of
federal
law
arising
from
a
state
court
decision
where
a
state
has
consented
to
suit.
that
is
this
case,
just
to
underscore
justice
kennedy's
point
that
the
assumption
underlying
seminole
may
well
have
included
this
court's
appellate
authority
over
a
case
like
this.
second,
mr.
cooper
mentioned
the
ford
motor
case
as
an
example
of
one
that
held
that
a...
a
waiver
of
state
sovereign
immunity
does
not
necessarily
translate
into
a
waiver
of
eleventh
amendment
immunity.
true,
but
only
with
respect
to
actions
in
the
district
court.
that
very
case,
which
is
typically
cited
for
this
proposition,
says
the
following
at
page
470
at
323
u.s.--
as
we
indicated
in
the
reed
case,
the
construction
given
the
indiana
statute
leaves
open
the
road
to
review
in
this
court
on
constitutional
grounds
after
the
issues
have
been
passed
on
by
state
courts.
so,
the
very
decision
in
which
the
court
held
that
a...
a
state
sovereign
immunity
waiver
does
not
convert
to
an
eleventh
amendment
waiver
also
assumes
that
there's
review
available
in
this
court.
and
finally,
a
lot
of
this
we
believe
is
entirely
hypothetical
because
the...
for
purposes
of
alabama
law...
this
is
a
case
cited
at
page
6
of
our
reply
brief...
in
a
case
called
state
against
norman
tobacco,
which
was
basically
the
reason
the
jurisdictional
argument
that
mr.
cooper
had
made
as
his
first
argument
did
not
work.
the
alabama
supreme
court
said
that
a...
an
action
of
the
sort
we
have
here...
and
i'm
quoting
again...
is
not
a
suit
against
the
state.
now,
that
doesn't
necessarily
bind
this
court
in
its
interpretation
of
the
eleventh
amendment,
but
that
bears
some
relevance
to
the
question.
unless
the
court
has
further
questions.
