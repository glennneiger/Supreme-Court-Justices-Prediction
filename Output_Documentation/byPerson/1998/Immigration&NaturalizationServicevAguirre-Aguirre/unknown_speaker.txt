unknown
speaker
what,
by
the
way,
if
you
have
a
chance,
are
we
supposed
to
do
about
the
fact
that
the
individual
now
says
that
isn't
a
correct
translation;
he
didn't
stone
any
individuals.
what
he
said
was,
he
threw
stones
against
the
side
of
the
bus
or
something
to
stop
the
bus,
but
they
didn't
actually
throw
stones
at
individuals,
which
might
be
important.
what
should
we
do
about
that?
unknown
speaker
well,
this
tape
question
is
a
very
late-in-the-day
thing,
is
it
not?
unknown
speaker
it
wasn't
presented
to
the
ninth
circuit
at
all.
unknown
speaker
now,
it
is
suggested
by
the
respondent
that
somehow
the
board's
and
the
government's
interpretation
of
the
statutory
standard
differs
in
some
way
from
that
recommended
pursuant
to
the
convention
and
the
protocol
that
bind
other
nations
generally.
unknown
speaker
the
language
in
the
convention
and
protocol
looks
about
the
same,
but
they
say
the
handbook
somehow
establishes
a
more
egregious
standard.
how
have
other
countries
interpreted
the
protocol
and
the
convention,
do
we
know?
unknown
speaker
uh-huh,
yes.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
is
that
question,
whether
there
are
serious
reasons
for
considering
that
a
particular
offense
qualifies
as
serious
and
nonpolitical,
is
that
a
question
of
fact
or
law,
do
you
think?
unknown
speaker
is
the
u.n.
convention
binding
on
the
united
states?
unknown
speaker
is
the
handbook
incorporated
in
the
protocol?
unknown
speaker
nor
in
our
statute.
is
that
protocol
self-executing?
unknown
speaker
we
need
a
statute
that
implements
it.
if
we
don't
have
a
statute
that
says
you
take
into
account
the
degree
of
persecution
that
will
be
received
at
home,
then
there
just
isn't
a
statute
that
does
that.
unknown
speaker
the
protocol
doesn't
do
that
either,
does
it?
it's
just
the
handbook
that
sets
up
this
balancing
test,
so
there's
no
inconsistency.
in
fact,
our
statute
seems
to
be
very
close
to
the
protocol.
there
isn't
a
significant
difference
between
those
two.
unknown
speaker
why
is
that
a
question
at
all?
unknown
speaker
oh.
unknown
speaker
well--
unknown
speaker
--well,
now,
as
i
understand
the--
--go
on.
as
i
understand
the
respondent,
they
say,
well,
you
can't
really
talk
about
mcmullen
proportionality,
the
seriousness
of
the
crime
in
light
of
the
political
objectives,
if
you
don't
also
talk
about
persecution,
which
i
take
it
you're
going
to
tell
us
is
a
non
sequitur,
or--
unknown
speaker
--why
not?
that
is
to
say,
why...
you
might
think...
normally
words
in
statutes
have
a
context,
and
suppose
a
person...
your
idea
is
you're
just
going
to
list
every
crime
in
the
u.
s.
code
and
put
it
on
two
lists,
it's
serious
or
not
serious.
well,
i...
why
wouldn't
you
in
this
kind
of
situation,
where
you
say
a
person,
let's
say,
has
a
minor
drug
offense
that
you
might
consider
serious.
well,
doesn't
it
make
a
difference
whether
we
consider
it
serious
for
the
purpose
of
the
statute,
whether
that's
seriousness
because
you
called
it
that,
it's
so
serious
that
it
means
the
person
will
be
sent
back
to
the
same
country
where
he'll
be
killed
immediately,
as
compared
with,
he'll
be
sent
back
to
the
same
country
rather
than
a
different
country,
where
he
will
serve
1
day's
imprisonment?
i
mean,
i
might
think...
you
tell
me...
if
this
person's
going
to
be
killed
because
i
have
to
send
him
back
to
the
same
country,
i
don't
think
that
that
previous
marijuana
crime
is
such
a
big
deal.
if
you
tell
me,
well,
we're
going
to
send
him
back
to
the
same
country
rather
than
a
different
country,
and
all
that
will
happen,
he'll
spend
7
hours
in
a
cell,
i'll
say,
well,
okay,
i'll
give
it
to
you.
i
mean,
why
not
make
that
kind
of
all-factors
considered?
you're
doing
that
with
nonpolitical.
unknown
speaker
ms.
millet,
may
i
clarify...
ask
you
to
clarify
one
thing,
because
i
think
when
justice
breyer
said,
it's
just
you
list
everything
in
the
u.s.
code
as
serious
or
not
serious,
do
i
understand
correctly
that
in
defining
what
is
a
nonpolitical
crime,
that
the
attorney
general
is
in
sync
with
the
handbook,
that
the
dissonance
comes
up
only
at
the
tail
end
on
the
question
of,
do
you
then
balance
against
the
risk
of
persecution.
but
i
thought
in
defining
what
is
a
nonpolitical
crime
it
isn't
simply
a
matter
of
going
through
the
u.s.
code
and
saying
this
is
serious
and
this
is
less
serious.
unknown
speaker
but
the
attorney
general
rejects
the
gross
disproportionality
test,
as
i
understand
it.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
which
i
take
it
is
what
the
ninth
circuit
was
getting
at
on
the
second
reason
that
it--
unknown
speaker
--ms.
millett,
do
i
have
to
give
the
attorney
general's
interpretation
deference
if
i
think
the
attorney
general's
interpretation
may
be
wrong
for
a
reason
quite
different
from
the
reason
that
respondent
here
says?
specifically,
i
don't
care
what
the
handbook
says.
i
care
what
congress
passed
and
what
the
fair
meaning
of
our
statute
is.
and,
frankly,
when
i...
i
find
it
quite
incredible
that
we
are
adopting
an
interpretation
that
takes
into
this
country
people
who
commit
any
crime
at
all,
even
murder,
so
long
as
it's
for
a
political
reason,
and
so
long
as
it's
not
disproportionate.
now,
there's
a
totally
different
reading
of
political...
non...
i
mean,
i've
never
heard
nonpolitical
crime.
it's
the
opposite
of
a
political
crime.
and
my
normal
understanding
of
a
political
crime
is
a
crime
whose
definition...
it's
not
the
motivation
of
the
criminal
in
committing
a
murder.
it's
rather,
the
very
definition
of
the
crime
is
a
political
crime,
such
as
the
law
in
cuba
under
which
some
journalists
have
just
gone
to
jail
because
they
criticized
the
government
in
the
press,
a
law
that
prohibits
criticism
of
the
government,
perhaps
a
law
that
prohibits...
even
a
law
that
prohibits
treason.
but
when
you're
committing
a
crime
that
is
independently
criminal...
murder,
rape,
whatever...
the
fact
that
you're
doing
it
for
a
political
motive,
why
should
that
make
any
difference
as
to
whether
we
want
those
people
in
this
country?
we
don't
allow
those
things
to
be
done
for
political
motives
in
this
country.
do
we
want
to
admit
immigrants
who
have
that
philosophy?
unknown
speaker
well,
all
congress
said
was,
nonpolitical
crime,
and
that's
a
perfectly
reasonable
interpretation
of
what
a
political
crime
consists
of.
in
fact,
i
think
it's
the
more
normal
one.
it's
not,
you
know,
well,
i
murdered
somebody,
but
it
was
proportionate.
it
was
really
sort
of
necessary
for
my
political
goal.
we're
admitting
people
on
those
bases?
unknown
speaker
what
about
lee
harvey
oswald,
who
succeeded
in
killing
president
kennedy?
is
that
a
political
crime?
unknown
speaker
well,
no,
but
i
mean--
[laughter]
--backing
off
and
looking
at
it--
unknown
speaker
--as
an
act
of
someone...
an
assassin,
but
who
disagreed
with
the
president
and
wanted
him
out
of
the
way.
could
that
be
a
political
crime?
unknown
speaker
to
assassinate
queen
elizabeth,
to
take
a
current
and
quite
likely--
[laughter]
--scenario,
that,
we'd
have...
we'd
just
weigh
it,
was
it
proportionate,
you
know.
could
he
have
achieved
his
end
by
some
lesser
means,
maybe
assassinating
somebody
else?
i
find
it
extraordinary
that
that's
what
we're
going
to
go
through
in
deciding
whether
to
admit
people.
unknown
speaker
no.
no,
it
isn't.
if
it's
extraordinary,
you
shouldn't
interpret
the
statute
that
way.
unknown
speaker
all
right,
but
ms.
millett,
has
the
attorney
general
ever,
let's
say,
given
a
favorable
interpretation
to
an
allegedly
political
crime
when
the
political
objective
was
at
least
not
an
acceptable
political
objective
to
the
government
of
the
united
states?
unknown
speaker
have
we
rewarded
the
enemies
of
our
side,
for
example,
during
the
cold
war...
when
the
attorney
general
looks
to
what
is,
let's
say,
the
political
motivation,
the
political
side
of
the
equation,
does
the
attorney
general
simply
count
as
political
those
political
objectives
which
are
acceptable
to
the
government
of
the
united
states
at
the
time?
unknown
speaker
so
that
somebody
who
tries
to
assassinate
saddam
hussein,
with
whom
we're
having
a
current
disagreement,
and
who
fails,
and
then
wants
to
come
here
and
get
refugee
status,
we
would
take
the
position,
the
attorney
general
would
take
the
position
possibly
that
that's...
that
that
person
is
admissible,
because
we're
having
a
disagreement
with
the
regime?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
just
want
to
know
if
that's
possible--
unknown
speaker
--under
your
view.
unknown
speaker
so--
unknown
speaker
--so
the
answer
is
yes,
that
person
would
be
admissible,
given
refugee
status,
possibly?
unknown
speaker
i
mean,
you
like
kennedy,
you
don't
like
hitler.
it's
a
question
of
where
saddam
falls
in...
you
know,
in
that--
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
--on
that
graph.
unknown
speaker
i
was
going
to
suggest
that
this
line
of
inquiry
takes
us
somewhat
far
afield
from
the
issues
in
this
case,
but
maybe
it
doesn't.
must
we
confront
in
this
case
the
issue
whether
or
not
the
political
motivation
of
the
crime
bears
on
its
political
character,
as
opposed
to,
on
the
other
hand,
defining
a
category
of
crimes,
speech,
protest,
that
are
political?
must
we
do
that
in
this
case?
unknown
speaker
but
it
seems
to
me
that
as
soon
as
you
agree
to
that,
and
i...
certainly
that's
the
attorney
general's
position,
the
question
is
not
how
political
it
was,
but
whether
it
was
nonpolitical,
and
as
soon
as
you've
got
any
political
ingredient
in
the
incident
involved,
it
cannot
be
described
as
totally
nonpolitical.
unknown
speaker
are
you
telling
me
that
every
case,
every
crime
involving
the
burning
of
a
couple
of
buses
would
always
be
nonpolitical?
unknown
speaker
let
me
be
sure
i
understand
your
position.
the
motivation,
is
it
the
motivation
required
to
satisfy
a
statutory
element
of
what
the
crime...
how
the
crime
is
defined,
or
is
it
the
motivation
of
the
particular
person
who
seeks
withholding
or
deportation?
unknown
speaker
but
it's
the
motivation
of
the
individual,
not
necessarily
the
term
motive
as
used
in
the
statutory
definition
of
the
crime,
is
that
right?
unknown
speaker
well,
whatever
the...
whatever
the
term,
mens
rea,
or
intent,
or
malice,
whatever.
it's
not
that
term
that
you're
talking
about.
you're
talking
about
the
subjective
intent
of
the
defendant
in
the
particular
case.
unknown
speaker
okay.
unknown
speaker
ms.
millett--
--but
i--
--let
me
go
back
to
justice
kennedy's
question,
because
i
am
frankly
getting
lost.
i
thought
that
it
was
the
position
of
both
the
attorney
general
and
even
the
ninth
circuit
that
we
are
dealing
with
a
nonpolitical
crime,
and
that
the
only
question
is,
given
that
nonpolitical
status
of
the
crime,
for
whatever
reason...
i
think
justice
scalia
has
suggested
maybe
it
was
the
wrong
reason
for
typing
it
a
nonpolitical,
but
anyway,
i
thought
that
the
attorney
general's
position
and
the
ninth
circuit
was,
this
falls
in
that
category,
but
you
still
have
to
weigh
the
persecution.
i
thought
that's
what
this
case
was
about.
unknown
speaker
but
you're
already
willing
to
make
the,
it
seems
to
me,
more
difficult
determination
of
how
necessary
it
was
for
the
political
objective.
i
mean,
that
requires
a
knowledge
of
the
political
situation
in
the
country
and
so
forth
and
so
on.
that
seems
to
me
even
harder
than
these
other
factors.
unknown
speaker
is
it
right--
--may
i
ask
you--
--no,
please
go
ahead.
may
i
ask
you
this
question
about
the
bia's
application
of
what
it
at
least
understood
was
the
attorney
general's
test?
the
bia
stated
in
a
rather
conclusory
way
that
here
the,
let's
say
the
political
character
of
the
crime
was
outweighed
by
its
seriousness,
which
it
described
as
being
great
enough
to
come
to
the
attention
of
the
warring
or
the
contending
parties
in
guatemala,
which
sounds
to
me
as
though
it's
saying,
whenever
the
crime,
given
its
political
motivation,
is
effective
in
getting
the
attention
of
the
political
contenders,
they've
gone
too
far,
that
the
criminality
by
definition
at
that
point
outweighs
whatever
political
character
they
might
have...
it
might
have.
so
it
sounds
as
though,
to
put
it
crudely,
nothing
fails
like
success,
seems
to
be
the
reasoning
of
the
bia
here.
would
it
be
appropriate,
even
if
we
do
not
accept
the
ninth
circuit's
opinion,
to
send
it
back
to
the
circuit,
presumably
to
be
sent
back
to
the
bia
to
explain
its
reasons
for
concluding,
as
it
did
here,
a
little
better
than
that
conclusory
reasoning
that
i've
just
characterized
as
if
you're
successful
enough
you
necessarily
fail
under
the
statute?
would
that
be
appropriate?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
thought...
did
i
mischaracterize
the
board?
i
didn't
mean
to.
unknown
speaker
so
you're
saying
it
was
emphasizing
the
violence
rather
than
the
merely
criminal
character
of
what
was
being
done.
unknown
speaker
may
i
just
ask
one...
i
know
that
you
want
to
reserve
some
time
for
rebuttal.
are
you
saying
that
the
crime
is
grossly
out
of
proportional
to
the
political
objectives?
unknown
speaker
and
that's
the
test?
unknown
speaker
and
that's
the
test?
unknown
speaker
thank
you,
ms.
millett.
ms.
wettstein,
we'll
hear
from
you.
unknown
speaker
well,
the
issue
before
us
is
whether
the
court
of
appeals
correctly
decided
this
case,
isn't
it,
and
there
are...
the
question
presented
is
whether
the
court
of
appeals
erred
in
reversing
the
decision
of
the
bia.
maybe
you
see
it
as
the
same
thing,
but
it
isn't
quite
the
same.
unknown
speaker
if
the
ninth
circuit
was
wrong,
even
if
the
bia
was
wrong,
that
does
not
mean
that
we
would
simply
say,
go
back
to
the
bia.
unknown
speaker
i
really
find
that
difficult
to
follow,
because
the
mcmullen
test
was
a
test
that
was
said
on
the
way
to
saying
that
the
applicant
there
did
not
qualify
for
any
dispensation.
so
to
take
a
test
that
picks
somebody
who
doesn't
qualify,
and
then
you
say,
but
now
somebody
else
who
wasn't
a
terrorist,
isn't
a
terrorist
and
therefore
didn't
satisfy
those
factors.
i
just
don't
think
that
you
can
get
very
far
from
taking
a
case
that
says,
this
person
has
these
five
characteristics
and
he's
out,
then
say
that
means
well,
when
you
don't
have
those
five
characteristics
you're
in.
i
really
don't
think
that
mcmullen
can
be
worked
that
way
in
reverse.
unknown
speaker
i
thought
the
board
has
always
said,
up
until
the
other
case,
that
it
isn't
taking
any
position
on
this
balancing.
it
notes
that
that's
the
position
that
the
handbook
takes,
but
as
far
as
i
know,
there
has
never
been
a
time
when
the
board
said,
we
embrace
that
test.
unknown
speaker
isn't
it
agreed
that
the
attorney
general
and
the
united
states
are
not
bound
by
the
handbook?
unknown
speaker
that
balancing
is
a
balancing
of
what?
unknown
speaker
do
you
mean,
it's
out
of
proportion
to
the
political
objections--
unknown
speaker
--objectives,
or
out
of
proportion
to
the
common
law
character
of
the
crime?
unknown
speaker
is
there
in
the
handbook
or,
more
particularly,
are
there
in
previous
board
opinions...
think
of
previous
board
opinions.
is
there
anything
in
those
opinions
that
either
says
directly,
or
says
by
incorporating
the
handbook,
that
in
deciding
whether
a
particular
crime
is
political
or
not
political,
one
will
look
to
see...
and
these
are
the...
whether
or
not
the
nonpolitical
part
is
a)
disproportionate,
b)
grossly
disproportionate,
or
c)
some
other
set
of
words.
what
in
the
previous
board's
opinion
either
says
directly,
or
through
incorporating
the
handbook,
whether
that
standard
should
be
proportionate,
grossly
disproportionate,
or
some
other
set
of
words.
and,
if
so,
what
does
it
say?
unknown
speaker
why
isn't
the
test
not
whether
the
board
has
followed
an
earlier
precedent
of
its
own,
but
whether
the
board's
action
conforms
to
the
statute?
why
does
the
ninth
circuit
say
the
board
is
wrong
for
not
following
mcmullen
if,
in
fact,
the
board's
decision
is
consistent
with
the
statute?
mcmullen
isn't
part
of
the
statute.
unknown
speaker
well,
to
whom
do
we
owe
deference
here,
to
the
attorney
general,
or
to
board
precedent,
or
what?
unknown
speaker
well,
is
there
any
room
for
interpretation
of
the
statute
here,
and
if
so,
do
we
look
to
the
attorney
general's
interpretation
and
give
it
deference,
or
what
do
we
do?
unknown
speaker
the
board
is
a
creature
of
the
attorney
general,
is
it
not?
unknown
speaker
i
mean,
she
can
overrule
anything
it
does.
unknown
speaker
well,
doesn't
it
apply
here...
to
go
back
to
the
chief
justice's
question,
is
there
some
reason
that
the
most
basic
rule
of
administrative
law
wouldn't
apply,
namely,
an
agency
cannot
change
its
decision
without
focusing
on
it?
you
have
to
follow
your
own
rules.
an
agency
has
to
follow
its
own
rules.
if
that
really
hornbook
rule
applies,
then
i
would
have
thought,
since
there's
certainly
nothing
in
this
one
paragraph--
unknown
speaker
--of
the
bia's
decision
that
purports
to
change
anything,
i
would
have
thought
the
question
would
be
whether
it's
consistent
with
its
prior
rules.
of
course
it
can
change
those
rules,
if
it
wants,
but
it
hasn't.
unknown
speaker
and
that's
why
i
asked
you,
what
is
the
prior
rule.
is
the
prior
rule
adopt
the
handbook?
is
the
prior
rule
the
word
grossly
disproportionate,
or
is
the
prior
rule
something
else,
because
whatever
that
prior
rule
is,
i
guess
they
should
have
applied
it
here
in
the
one
paragraph,
so
what
is
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
are...
do
you
agree
with
justice
breyer
that
an
agency
could
not
come
out
differently
in
a
particular
case
from
the
way
it
had
before
without
some
sort
of
an
elaborate
procedure?
unknown
speaker
well,
supposing
this
were
just
the
attorney
general,
you
know,
not
a
bia
or
something
like
that,
the
attorney
general
under
the...
and
last
year
she
says,
well,
i
think
mcmullen
is
right,
then
this
year
she
says,
well,
no,
i'm
not...
i'm
going
to
back
away
from
mcmullen
some.
unknown
speaker
is
there
some
administrative
law
rule
that
says
she
can't
do
that?
unknown
speaker
aren't
you
going
to
answer
yes
to
that,
that
an
agency
does
have
to
focus
on
it?
unknown
speaker
without
focusing
on
it,
even.
without
focusing
on
it.
that's
what
justice
breyer--
unknown
speaker
--does
arizona
grocery
apply--
--yes.
justice
breyer
wants
you
to
adopt
the
position
that
an
agency
cannot
alter
its
course
from
a
prior
adjudication
without
focusing
specifically
on
that
adjudication.
unknown
speaker
now,
if
you
say
that
you
agree
with
justice
breyer,
i'm
going
to
ask
you
what
case
you
have
in
mind
that
says--
--arizona
grocery.
you
say
arizona
grocery
is
the
hornbook--
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
it's,
an
agency
has
to
follow
its
own
rules.
unknown
speaker
the
agency
does
have
to
follow
its
own
rules--
--right.
unknown
speaker
--in
the
sense
of
regulations.
arizona
grocery
had
no
regulations.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
thought
here
the
board
had
taken
the
position
in
mcmullen
and
in
this
case
that
the
question
of
whether
a
crime
is
a
political
offense
is
primarily
one
of
fact.
i
mean,
that
is
primarily
a
fact
issue,
and
the
board
here
determined
as
a
matter
of
fact
that
it
was
one
that
followed
the
language
of
the
statute.
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
well,
have
we
applied
some
special
rule
in
the
area
of
fact
determination
that
says
they
have
to
explain
it,
or
can
they
just
determine
the
facts,
and
do
we
owe
some
deference
to
that
factual
determination?
unknown
speaker
well,
advert
if
you
will
for
a
minute
to
what
the
ninth
circuit
said.
you...
in
the
first
place,
i
guess
the
third
reason
for
which
the
ninth
circuit
thought
there
had
been
error
was
the
failure
to
consider
the
seriousness
of
the
persecution.
and
i
think
you
mentioned
earlier
that
mcmullen
didn't
involve
that,
so
that's
an
open
question
so
far
as
mcmullen
goes.
unknown
speaker
and
quite
obviously
the
board
did
not
in
this
case
think
that
whatever
the
relevance
of
that
factor
might
be,
if
relevant
at
all,
would
have
been
in
favor
of
your
client.
go
to
the
second...
i
think
it
was
the
second
reason
that
the
ninth
circuit
gave,
and
that
was
that
the
board
had
failed
to
consider
the
possibility
of
a
gross
disproportionality,
or
the
significance
of
gross
disproportionality
between
the
political
and
the
common
law
character.
in
mcmullen,
did
the
board
adopt
a
gross
disproportionality?
unknown
speaker
did
they
use
that
term?
unknown
speaker
they
used
that
term?
unknown
speaker
did
they
say
that
that
was
a
condition,
that
that
condition
always
had
to
exist
in
order
for
the
crime
to
be
nonpolitical?
unknown
speaker
they
considered
it
a
relevant
factor,
is
that...
would
that
be
a
fair
way
to--
unknown
speaker
--in
mcmullen
did
they
say,
look,
it's
just
one
of
the
things
that
ought
to
be
considered,
is
there
gross
disproportionality
or
isn't
there?
unknown
speaker
without
saying
that
if
you
satisfy
that
test
a
particular
result
necessarily
follows.
unknown
speaker
okay.
unknown
speaker
but
they
found
it
nonpolitical
here
even
without
finding
it
to
be
atrocious.
why
should
they
then
move
on
to
consider
the
atrociousness
factor?
having
found
that
the
other
factors
have
already
rendered
it
nonpolitical,
if
the
atrociousness
factor
is
not
essential,
as
you
say
it
isn't,
then
what's
the
harm
that's
been
done?
they
looked
at
the
other
factors
and
they
said,
i
look
at
these
other...
it's
nonpolitical.
unknown
speaker
i
don't
even
have
to
consider
whether
it's
atrocious.
maybe
it
is,
maybe
it
isn't.
who
cares?
unknown
speaker
it's
nonpolitical
because
of
these
other
reasons.
unknown
speaker
well,
then--
unknown
speaker
--but
then
it
seems
to
me
the
agency
could
have
done
just
exactly
what
i've
said,
and
certainly
we
give
the
agency
the
benefit
of
the
doubt.
what...
i
mean,
i
assume
we
apply
a
substantial
evidence
test
on
all
those
factual
matters,
right,
so
there's
some
evidence
that
could
support
the
agency's
determination,
is
that
right?
although
i'm
not
sure
the
ninth
circuit
did
that.
it
seems
to
me
they
reviewed
all
the
factual
determinations
de
novo.
unknown
speaker
i...
let's
concentrate
on
what
the
bia
did,
because
it
seems
to
me
that
in
characterizing
what
went
on
here,
it
did
even
what
the
handbook
says,
and
it
says,
in
determining
whether
this
is
political
or
nonpolitical,
its
closest
to
the
political
camp
when
you're
acting
against
the
government
or
government
personnel,
much
more
iffy
if
your
target,
the
person
you're
actually
hitting
on,
is
a
private
individual,
or
a
private
company,
and
then
weakest
of
all
when
you're
hitting
on
private
individuals
and
you're
trying
to
produce
general
chaos.
now,
here
the
people
who
were
hurt,
even
if
just
temporarily,
because
they
were
lassoed
and
hit...
we'll
leave
out
the
stones...
were
private
individuals.
the
shopkeepers
whose
merchandize
was
trashed
were
private
individuals.
so
it
seems
to
me
that
that
falls
in
a
category
where
to
call
it
political
is
highly
questionable
even
on
the...
all
the
u.n.
standards.
unknown
speaker
do
you
agree
with
the
statement
that's
made
in
that
u.n.
brief
that
the
political
link
is
strongest
when
the
target
of
the
activity
is
government
personnel
and
property,
or
is
that
wrong?
unknown
speaker
but
we're
talking
about
what
the
applicant's
acts
were.
and
the
next
thing
i
read
from
the
u.n.
brief
is,
the
link
is
weakest
when
the
politically
motivated
act...
nobody
disputes
that
these
acts
were
politically
motivated...
when
the
politically
motivated
act
is
principally
directed
against
private
interests.
unknown
speaker
and
the...
whatever...
the
bus
was
privately
owned,
was
it
not?
unknown
speaker
the
individuals
who
were
on
the
bus
were
just
ordinary
individuals.
they
weren't--
unknown
speaker
--government
servants.
unknown
speaker
so
that's
why
they
burned
them?
unknown
speaker
that's
why
they
burned
them,
the
buses?
unknown
speaker
what
about
the
shopkeepers
whose
merchandise
was
just
trashed?
did
the
government...
has
no...
you
describe
the
bus
transportation
that's
in
close
with
the
government,
but
these
private
shopkeepers
who
had
their
merchandise
trashed,
for
what
reason?
unknown
speaker
suppose
i
agreed
with
you,
purely
for
the
sake
of
argument,
on
three
points...
two
anyway.
suppose
i
disagree...
suppose
i
thought
the
law
prior
to
this
case
in
the
board
is
really
murky.
there
isn't
a
clear
rule.
assume
that
with
me.
i'm
not
saying
whether
that's
so,
so
assuming.
assume,
second,
that
this
administrative
law
judge
really
went
into
this
in
the
greatest
depth.
and
after
really
going
into
it
he
says,
you
know,
on
balance
this
is
a
political
crime.
there
are
some
things
for,
some
against,
but
i
think
it
is
basically.
then
he
gets
reversed
by
the
appellate,
the
bia,
and
they
do
it
with
one
sentence,
just
saying,
well,
we
think
it
outweighs,
nobody
focusing
on
the
right
test,
nobody
doing
anything.
that's
disturbing
to
me,
if
those
assumptions
are
true.
what
principle
of
law
would
justify
my
sending
the
case
back
for
further
work
by
the
board?
unknown
speaker
no.
i've
assumed
that
out
of
it,
because
i've
said
that
the
previous...
i'm
assuming...
i'm
going
to
read
all
that
stuff,
but
i'm
now
assuming
against
you
that
the
previous
state
of
the
art
in
the
board
is
all
murky.
they
don't
have
a
clear
rule,
and
there's
nothing
that
says
you
have
to
follow
a
rule
that
isn't
there,
so
if
it's
murky,
you
see...
let's
assume
that's
all
murky.
and
now
let's
also
assume,
which
i
think
is
true,
that
the
alj
here
really
went
into
this
factually,
and
then
what
i
think
is
also
true
is,
he
gets
reversed
by
the
board
with
a
simple
sentence
which
doesn't
analyze
anything,
which
doesn't
purport
to
say
what's
the
right
test,
it's
nothing.
it's
just
somebody
saying,
oh,
you're
wrong.
unknown
speaker
okay.
now,
if
all
that's
true,
what
principle
of
law
will
justify
your
victory,
which
is
victory
in
the
sense
of
getting
it
sent
back?
unknown
speaker
i
didn't
understand
that
this
was
your
appeal,
that
what
you
were
complaining
about
here
is
the
procedural
failure
of
the
board
to
have
an
adequate
opinion
explaining
its
overruling
of
the
administrative
law
judge.
is
that
in
your...
i
don't
recall
reading
that
portion
of
your
brief.
unknown
speaker
was
any...
please,
let
me...
was
any
of
the
reasons
the
failure
of
the
board
to
explain
itself
in
adequate
detail?
unknown
speaker
yes,
i'd...
i'd--
unknown
speaker
--i
mean,
i
know
they
said
the
board
was
wrong,
but
i
don't
think
that
they...
i
don't
recall
just
a
procedural
objection.
even
if
the
board
was
right,
they
didn't
have
an
adequate
opinion,
which
is--
unknown
speaker
--of
the--
unknown
speaker
--29
of
what?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
was
justice
scalia
asking
about
your
brief,
or
about
the
ninth
circuit?
unknown
speaker
well,
both.
i--
unknown
speaker
--no,
no.
that
is
different.
that
isn't
the
point.
justice
breyer
was
making
a
purely
procedural...
and
you
know,
i
like
procedure.
i
used
to
teach
administrative
procedure.
[laughter]
and
he
was
making
a
purely
procedural
point,
that
even
if
the
board
was
right,
it
didn't
explain
itself.
and
i
don't
recall
that
being
in
this
case,
either
at
the
ninth
circuit
level
or
in
your
submissions
to
the
court.
now,
if
it's
there
i--
unknown
speaker
--if
you
can't
find
it,
maybe
you
can
just
file
it
with--
unknown
speaker
--do
you
have
it
there?
unknown
speaker
whereabouts
on
the
page
are
you
going
to
reading
from?
unknown
speaker
that's
saying
that
they
didn't
apply
the
proper
tests,
which
i
understand
that
to
be
in
the
case.
you're
saying
they
didn't
apply
the
rule
that
the
board
had
before
it.
but
i'm
not
talking
about
whether
they
didn't
apply
the
proper
rule.
i'm
just
talking
about
the
fact
that
they
didn't
explain
themselves.
it
was
simply
unexplained,
and
i
don't
recall
that
being
in
the
case.
unknown
speaker
well,
but
that's
in...
you
say
the
question
here
is
if
they
didn't
explain
themselves,
but
i
simply
don't
see
that
in
the
part
of
the
ninth
circuit
opinion
you
just
quoted,
that
they
are...
that
the
ninth
circuit
is
saying
that,
that...
they're
saying
several
reasons
why
the
board
was
wrong,
but
as
i
read
it,
one
of
them
was
not
that
it
didn't
fully...
that
it
didn't
explain
itself
in
its
opinion
reversing
the
immigration
judge.
unknown
speaker
but
they're
still
reversing
the
immigration
judge,
and
i
understood
part
of
justice
breyer's
question
to
be,
you
know,
was
the
board
wrong
for
reversing
the
immigration
judge
without
giving
any
explanation
for
doing
it,
and
i
don't
see
that
as
being
in
the
case.
do
you
think
it
is?
unknown
speaker
you
can
answer
that
yes
or
no.
unknown
speaker
there's
one
issue
of
at
least,
it
seems
to
me
clear,
and
i
think
we
have
to
decide
it
one
way
or
another,
whatever
else
we
decide.
the
ninth
circuit
said,
the
board
erred
as
a
matter
of
law
in
failing
to
consider
the
persecution
that
the
applicant
might
suffer
if
he
returned
to
guatemala.
we
have,
as
was
noted,
a
square
conflict.
the
house
of
lords
goes
one
way
on
that,
a
lower
court
in
canada
goes
the
other
way
on
that.
we
are
being
asked
to
decide
that
question
of
law.
the
house
of
lords
decided
as
crisply
as
it
could
the
crime
either
is
or
is
not
political
when
committed.
its
character
cannot
depend
on
consequences
the
offender
may...
actually
would
suffer
if
he
returned.
mustn't
we
decide
at
least
that
question,
either
the
canada
court
is
right,
or
the
house
of
lords
is
right?
you
said
we
don't
have
to--
unknown
speaker
--well,
i'll
ask
for
clarification
whether
indeed
it's
true
that
the
attorney
general
has
not
resolved
that
issue.
unknown
speaker
it's
never
been
rejected,
and
it's
a
flat-out
statement,
right
in
the
thing,
we
reject
the
balancing
test.
unknown
speaker
well,
you
point
to
the
ambiguity
in
a
statement
that
we
reject
any
interpretation
of
the
phrase,
particularly
serious
crime,
serious
nonpolitical
crime,
which
would
vary
with
the
nature
of
the...
of
evidence
of
persecution.
unknown
speaker
well,
am
i
wrong
in
getting
the
picture
that
the
board
has
twice
said,
it's
an
open
question
with
us?
one
said,
in
dicta,
it's
closed,
we're
rejecting
it.
unknown
speaker
thank
you,
ms.
wettstein.
ms.
millett,
you
have
4
minutes
remaining.
is
it
true
that
the
government
has
no
position
on
the
balancing
test,
the
third
ground
of
the
ninth
circuit's
decision?
unknown
speaker
17a
of
the
petition?
unknown
speaker
with
all
that,
suppose
it
were
established
crystal
clear
that
if
this
person
is
sent
back
to
guatemala
he
will
be
horribly
tortured,
the
answer
would
still
be
the
same?
unknown
speaker
convention
on
torture,
you
mean.
unknown
speaker
there
are
those
of
us
who
think
that
there
should
be
torture
for
a
convention,
maybe--
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
what's
bothering
me,
and
i
can't
quite
get
my
hands
on
it,
is
this...
is
purports
to
be,
as
it's
presented,
an
argument
about
what
standard
to
apply.
but
looking
at
the
paragraph
that
you
just
read,
and
the
ninth
circuit,
it
may
be
that
everybody
agreed
on
what
the
standard
was,
and
it's
that
mcmullen
standard,
and
this
is
really
a
case
about
whether
or
not
that
bia
board
applied
the
standard
that
they
purported
to
apply.
unknown
speaker
and
if
i
read
through
this
record
and
come
to
that
conclusion,
i'm
not
sure
what
to
do.
that's
why
i
ask
the
question.
if
this
isn't
really
a
case
where
people
are
disagreeing
about
standards,
at
least
in
the
political...
they
may
be
on
the
serious
word,
the
word
serious,
but
they
may
not
be
on
the
word
political.
it
may
be
grossly
disproportional
is
what
they
mean.
unknown
speaker
which
are?
unknown
speaker
justice
kennedy
has
an
opinion
to
announce.
