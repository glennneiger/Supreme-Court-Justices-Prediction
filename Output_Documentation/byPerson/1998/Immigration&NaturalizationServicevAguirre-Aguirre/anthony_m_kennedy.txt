the
opinion
of
the
court
to
announce
in
no.
97-1754,
immigration
and
naturalization
service
versus
aguirre-aguirre.
one
and
above
aguirre-aguirre
is
a
native
and
citizen
of
guatemala.
he
is
the
respondent
here.
he
was
charged
with
deportability
by
the
immigration
and
naturalization
service
for
illegal
entry
into
this
country.
aguirre-aguirre
conceded
that
he
was
deportable
but
he
applied
for
withholding
of
the
deportation
based
on
his
expressed
fear
as
prosecution
for
earlier
political
activities
in
guatemala.
as
if
relevant
here
withholding
will
not
apply
and
deportation
is
authorized
where
there
are
serious
reasons
for
considering
that
the
alien
has
committed
a
“serious
nonpolitical
crime”
--
and
that's
the
statutory
phrase
--
outside
the
united
states
prior
to
arrival
in
this
country.
the
board
of
immigration
appeals
ordered
the
respondent
deported,
it
determine
that
to
protest
certain
government
policies
in
guatemala
that
he
and
a
group
of
which
he
was
a
member
had
burned
the
buses,
assaulted
passengers,
and
vandalized
and
destroyed
property
in
private
shops.
applying
the
test,
it
had
developed
in
a
prior
decision.
now,
the
board
of
immigration
appeals
concluded
that
these
were
“serious
nonpolitical
crimes”
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute
because
their
common
law
or
criminal
character
outweighed
their
political
nature.
on
appeal
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
concluded
that
the
bia
had
applied
an
incorrect
interpretation
of
the
serious
nonpolitical
crime
exception
and
it
remanded
for
further
proceedings.
according
to
the
court
of
appeals,
the
board
erred
in
failing
to
consider
the
prosecution
respondent
might
suffer
upon
return
to
guatemala,
whether
his
acts
were
grossly
out
of
proportion
to
their
objectives
or
were
atrocious,
and
the
political
necessity
and
success
of
his
methods.
we
disagree
with
the
court
of
appeals.
the
court
of
appeals
failed
to
accord
the
required
level
of
deference
to
the
interpretation
adapted
by
the
bia.
as
we
have
recognized
before
the
board
should
be
accorded
judicial
deference
as
it
gives
ambiguous
statutory
terms,
concrete
meaning
through
a
process
of
case-by-case
adjudication.
the
court
of
appeals
error
is
clear
with
respect
to
its
holding
that
the
board
was
required
to
balance
respondent’s
criminal
acts
against
the
risk
of
persecution
he
would
face
if
returned
to
guatemala.
for
an
alien
to
eligible
for
withholding
at
all,
the
statute
requires
a
finding
that
he
is
at
risk
of
persecution.
it
is
reasonable
to
decide
that
this
factor
can
be
considered
on
its
own
and
not
also
as
a
factor
in
determining
whether
the
crime
itself
is
a
serious
nonpolitical
crime.
the
other
reasons
given
by
the
court
for
reversing
bia
also
do
not
withstand
scrutiny.
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
reversed
and
the
case
is
remanded
for
further
proceedings
consistent
with
out
opinion,
and
the
opinion
is
unanimous.
