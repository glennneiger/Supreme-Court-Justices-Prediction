ms.
petitioner
patricia
a
millett
yes.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
the
immigration
and
nationality
act,
congress
expressly
invested
in
the
attorney
general
the
authority
to
determine
whether
an
alien
who
has
committed
a
serious,
nonpolitical
crime
should
be
denied
withholding
of
deportation.
congress
further
made
clear
that
once
the
attorney
general
has
serious
reasons
for
considering
that
such
a
crime
occurred,
the
bar
on
withholding
is
mandatory.
the
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
the
attorney
general,
through
the
board
of
immigration
appeals,
had
serious
reasons
for
considering
that
respondent's
acts
of
burning
buses,
destroying
private
stores,
and
hitting,
binding,
and
stoning
innocent
civilians
constituted
serious
nonpolitical
crimes.
ms.
petitioner
patricia
a
millett
first
of
all,
we
disagree
it
is
important,
but
even
if
the
court
considered
that
it
was,
the
respondent
has
filed
a
motion
to
remand
with
the
board
of
immigration
appeals
and,
i
think
consistent
with
this
court's
decision
in
stone
v.
ins,
this
court
can
go
ahead
and
proceed
to
review
the
judgment
that's
before
it
and
allow
that
motion
to
proceed
on
its
own
track.
ms.
petitioner
patricia
a
millett
it
most
certainly
is.
it
didn't
appear
until
the
brief
in
opposition
in
this
court,
and
that
was--
ms.
petitioner
patricia
a
millett
--not
at
all,
even
though
the
same
counsel
represented
mr.
aguirre
there,
but
that...
again,
the
motion
is
pending
before
the
board
of
immigration
appeals.
we
believe
it
should
have
no
impact
on
this
court's
resolution
of
this
case,
or
ability
to
proceed
and
decide
this
case.
ms.
petitioner
patricia
a
millett
uh-huh.
ms.
petitioner
patricia
a
millett
in
this
particular
regard,
on
the
question
of
balancing
the
risk
of
persecution
there
are
a
couple
of
other
things--
ms.
petitioner
patricia
a
millett
--the
ninth
circuit
required
that
haven't,
as
far
as
we
know,
been
addressed
by
other
countries.
but
on
the
question
of
balancing
the
risk
of
persecution--
ms.
petitioner
patricia
a
millett
--there
are
two
courts
that
have
directly
ruled
on
it,
and
they
are
split.
the
canadian
court
applied
the
balancing
test
that
is
recommended
in
the
handbook,
without
saying
that
it
was
compelled,
but
choosing
to
apply
it.
the
british
house
of
lords
has
held
that
the
balancing
test
does
not
apply,
so
we
have
a
one-one
split.
the
respondent...
or,
i'm
sorry,
the
united
nations
high
commissioner
in
his
amicus
brief
also
cites
a
decision
from
the
french
commissioner
of
refugees
in
a
case
called
pham,
p-h-a-m.
that
case,
however,
did
not...
first
of
all,
has
been
vacated,
and
secondly
did
not
address
the
serious
nonpolitical
crime
exception.
it
addressed
article
33's
particularly
serious
crime
of
sexual--
ms.
petitioner
patricia
a
millett
--well,
it
has
two
tiers.
whether
the
test
the
attorney
general
has
adopted
for
identifying
serious
nonpolitical
crimes
could,
of
course,
be
reviewed
for
whether...
its
consistency
with
the
statute,
but
because
of
the
language
that
the
attorney
general
may
determine,
and
because
of
the
serious
reasons
for
considering
language,
that
would
be
an
extremely
deferential
review.
if
the
test
is
legally
correct,
then
the
application
of
any
facts
in
the
record
in
a
given
case
would
be...
against
that
test
would
be
reviewed
for
substantial
evidence.
ms.
petitioner
patricia
a
millett
the
convention
is
not.
the
proto...
the
united
states
is
a
party
to
the
protocol
relating
to
the
status
of
refugees,
and
that
has
incorporated
virtually
all
of
the
provisions
of
the
convention,
including
this
definition
of
refugee,
which
includes...
this
portion
of
its
definition
of
refugee,
which
includes
a
serious
nonpolitical
crime
exception.
the
only
thing
that
is
not
carried
over
is
the
original
limitations,
original
european
limitations
on
the
definition
of
refugee.
ms.
petitioner
patricia
a
millett
no,
it
is
not.
in
fact,
we...
nothing...
nothing
in
the
text
of
the
protocol
or
the
convention
mentions,
let
alone
compels,
balancing
the
risk
of
persecution.
ms.
petitioner
patricia
a
millett
no,
it
is
not,
and
so
even...
i
guess
even
if
it
did,
if
the
attorney
general's
reasonable
interpretation
was
that
that
had
not
been
effectuated
via
united
states
law,
again
that
would
not
become--
ms.
petitioner
patricia
a
millett
--absolutely,
although
again--
ms.
petitioner
patricia
a
millett
--no,
there
is
absolutely
no,
as
we
see,
tension
between
the
protocol
or
the
convention
and
the
united
states
law
and
the
attorney
general's
interpretation
of
that.
the
only
question
is
whether
we
are
inconsistent
with
a
recommendation
in
a
handbook
written
by
the
united
nations
high
commissioner
of
refugees.
ms.
petitioner
patricia
a
millett
because
that's
what
the
ninth
circuit
relied
on.
ms.
petitioner
patricia
a
millett
it's
not
our
question.
[laughter]
ms.
petitioner
patricia
a
millett
we,
in
fact,
agree
and
think
it
should
not
be
a
question.
the
attorney
general
was,
of
course,
entitled
to
give
that
document
weight
if
she
chooses
in
interpreting
the
statute,
but
is
not
bound
by
it.
ms.
petitioner
patricia
a
millett
yes,
that
would
be
our
position.
the
test
for
a
serious
nonpolitical
crime
and
the
proportionality
test
that
that
applies
are
tests
that
focus
on
the
character
of
the
crime
itself.
whether
someone
later
faces
a
risk
of
persecution
for
protected
status
or
protected
conduct
has
no
bearing
on
whether
an
earlier
committed
crime
had
a
serious
nonpolitical
character.
it
either
was
or
was
not
a
serious
nonpolitical
crime
when
it
was
committed,
and
the
fact
that
a
risk
of
persecution
materializes
doesn't
change
that.
ms.
petitioner
patricia
a
millett
the
first
thing
to
keep
in
mind
is,
the
question
in
this
case
is
whether
the
attorney
general
is
compelled
by
the
statute
or
the
convention
to
adopt
that
approach.
whether
or
not
one
thinks
it
would
be
a
good
approach
to
adopt,
she
most
definitely
is
not,
in
our
opinion,
by
the
text,
legislative
history,
drafting
history
of
either
the
statute
or
the
convention
and
protocol.
the
second
thing
to
keep
in
your
mind
is,
you
mentioned
the
history
of
terms.
the
term
nonpolitical
crime
does
have
a
history.
it's
a
term
with
meaning
in
immigration...
i'm
sorry,
in
international
law
and
in
extradition
law,
and
the
balancing
that
the
attorney
general
has
used
to
identify
whether
something
is
political
or
nonpolitical
draws
upon
that
history,
but
it
is
still...
both
of
them
are
describing
the
crime
itself.
the
risk
of
persecution
doesn't
change
the
crime.
the
question
is
whether
it's
a
serious
nonpolitical
crime--
ms.
petitioner
patricia
a
millett
--no,
that
is
correct.
that
is
correct,
and
sometimes
the
analysis
of
serious
and
nonpolitical
can
overlap,
but
it's...
as
i
explained,
the
term
nonpolitical
and
the
definition
that
the
attorney
general
has
adopted
is
consistent
with
the
handbook,
is
consistent
with
the
ninth
circuit's
at
least
prior
articulation--
ms.
petitioner
patricia
a
millett
--the
attorney
general
rejects
the
notion
that
things
have
to
be
tantamount
to
atrocious
conduct.
ms.
petitioner
patricia
a
millett
how--
ms.
petitioner
patricia
a
millett
--yes.
that
is
how
we
interpreted
that.
ms.
petitioner
patricia
a
millett
well,
that
is
a
choice
again
for
congress
and
the
executive
branch,
particularly
congress
to
make.
ms.
petitioner
patricia
a
millett
the
question
would
be
if...
the
way
in
which
that
would
come
up,
and
sometimes
there
are
things
that
are
so...
how
serious
it
is
can
be
factored
into
whether
or
not
it
can
even
be
accepted
as
nonpolitical.
again,
the
history
of
the
term
political
or
nonpolitical
is
a
contextual
inquiry,
and
the
more
drastic
means
that
are
employed
is
often
a
factor.
on
the
other
hand,
someone
who
attempted
to
kill
hitler
during
world
war
ii,
or
if
they'd
even,
in
fact,
succeeded,
would
not
necessarily
have
to
be
excluded
from
a
country
under
this
definition.
and
there
are--
ms.
petitioner
patricia
a
millett
--i
don't
think
that
would
be
the
position
of
the
united
states,
and
i
don't
know
whether
it
was
a
political
motive--
ms.
petitioner
patricia
a
millett
--right.
right.
ms.
petitioner
patricia
a
millett
could
the
acts
of
an
assassin
ever
be
considered
a
political
crime?
i
think
yes,
the
attorney
general
would
have
the
discretion
to
do
that
under
this
statute.
ms.
petitioner
patricia
a
millett
well,
again,
justice
scalia,
even
if
this
court
finds
it
extraordinary,
the
question
is
what
congress
and
the
executive
branch
have
determined.
this
is
a
question
of--
ms.
petitioner
patricia
a
millett
--if
it's
permitted
by
the
plain
language...
it
is
not
foreclosed.
it
is
not
foreclosed
by
the
plain
language
of
the
statute
or
the
plain
language
of
the
convention.
in
fact,
we
believe
that
that
is
the
type
of
deference
that
the
attorney
general
was
granted
under--
ms.
petitioner
patricia
a
millett
--i'm
having
a
little--
ms.
petitioner
patricia
a
millett
--it's
a
larger
inquiry
than
that,
and
for
example,
with
the
hypothetical
about
queen
elizabeth,
the
attorney
general
will
also
consider
the
structure
of
the
country
in
which...
first
of
all,
we
think
it's
perfectly...
the
attorney
general
is
free
to
consider
political
relations
in
this
aspect
of
the
test.
ms.
petitioner
patricia
a
millett
i
hesitate
to
identify
any
particular
leader
or
country
or
anything
in
a
way
that
would
suggest
we
would
open
the
doors
for
killing
or
not,
and
in
fact
often
an
assassination--
ms.
petitioner
patricia
a
millett
--but
whether--
ms.
petitioner
patricia
a
millett
--i
mean,
actually,
historically
in
the
late
1800s
and
early
1900s,
the
political
offense
exception
to
extradition
often
had
in
mind
the
lone
assassin
who
would
go
and
shoot
a
head
of
state,
but
the--
ms.
petitioner
patricia
a
millett
--the
attorney
general
would
not--
ms.
petitioner
patricia
a
millett
--the...
given...
the
question
is
withholding
of
deportation,
not
refugee
status.
possibly,
yes,
but
what
would
the
attorney
general
consider--
ms.
petitioner
patricia
a
millett
--what's
more
important...
what
is
important--
ms.
petitioner
patricia
a
millett
--in
the...
what
is
important
for
the
attorney
general
to
consider
and
has
considered,
in
fact
in
the
doherty
case
that
came
before
this
court
a
few
years
ago,
is
whether
there
is
a...
how
there's...
the
means
chosen
relates
to
the
ability
to
express
and
obtain...
express
political
views
and
obtain
political
change
in
a
given
country.
in
the
united
kingdom,
which
was
at
issue
in
doherty,
the
attorney
general
concluded
that
it
was
a
critical
or
an
important
factor
that
there
are
peaceful
means
for
changing
government
and
expressing
views
in
that
country.
there
may
be
countries
and
there
may
be
times
in
this
world
when
there
will
be
a
country
and
there
is
no
way
of
safely
protesting,
expressing
your
view,
or
changing
the
government,
except
through
violence.
now,
that
does
not
mean
that
all
violence
will
be
proper,
or
will
be
acceptable.
ms.
petitioner
patricia
a
millett
i
don't
think
there's
any
question
that
political
motive
is
one
factor,
but
it
is
not
the
exclusive
or
driving
factor.
the
question
is
whether
it's
a
serious
nonpolitical
crime,
not
a
serious
nonpolitical
criminal,
and
so
the
inquiry--
ms.
petitioner
patricia
a
millett
--that
is
not
something
we
agree
with
at
all,
justice
stevens.
the
term
nonpolitical
crime,
as
interpreted
by
the
attorney
general,
is
a
term
with
a
history,
and
we're
focusing
on
the
crime,
not
the
criminal.
and
the
history
in
international
law,
and
in
particular
in
extradition
law,
is
a
contextual
inquiry.
it's
quite
clear
that
countries...
in
fact,
the
french
test
is
an
objective
test
that
doesn't
look
at
motivation
at
all.
ms.
petitioner
patricia
a
millett
no,
but
there's
not
a
bright
line
of
yes
it
would
be,
or
no
it
would
not
be
for
political...
but
what
is
clear
is
that
the
fact
that
they
have
a
political
motivation
alone
is
not
going
to
make
that
a
political
crime,
any
more
than
blowing
up
a
federal
day
care
center
in
oklahoma
city
is
going
to
be
considered
political.
ms.
petitioner
patricia
a
millett
motivation
is
one
factor
in
deciding
what
that...
if
what
the
person
did
qualifies
as
a
nonpolitical
crime.
it
is
only
one
factor.
ms.
petitioner
patricia
a
millett
yes.
oh,
it's...
for
mens
rea,
you
mean,
or--
ms.
petitioner
patricia
a
millett
--the
subjective
political
motive
is...
yes--
ms.
petitioner
patricia
a
millett
--is
one
factor,
although
again,
in
this
contextual
inquiry
on
the
nature,
of
whether
something
is
a
political
or
nonpolitical
crime,
we
look
not
only,
again,
at
the
motivation,
but
at
the
nature
of
the
crime,
and
one
factor
that
has
been
critically
important
in
that
analysis
historically,
and
is
now
for
the
attorney
general,
is
whether
civilians
have
been
the
target.
and
a
political
motivation
that
takes...
that
vents
its
political
anger
on
innocent
civilians,
as
occurred
here,
is...
carries
a
heavy
presumption
in
international
law
and
in
the
eyes
of
the
attorney
general
that
it
is
non--
ms.
petitioner
patricia
a
millett
--well,
there
were
a
couple
of
other...
it's
not
absolutely
clear
to
me
where
the
other
two
factors
of
the
ninth
circuit
mentioned
the
atrociousness
and
the
necessity
and
success,
where
they
come
into
this
calculus.
but
certainly
on
a
question
of
balancing
the
risk
of
persecution,
it's
only
been
argued
about
deciding
whether
or
not
it's
serious.
and
again,
our
position
is
not
only
that
it
is
not
compelled
in
any
means
by
the
statutory
language,
indeed
it's
a
strained
one,
but
also
to
keep
in
mind
that
adopting
such
a
balancing
test
would
result
in
a
complicated
matrix
of
withholding
judgments
under
which
you're
going
to
be
having
varying
degrees
of
seriousness
of
the
crime
weighed
against
varying
gradations
of
actual
threats
to
life
and
liberty,
and
the
nature
of
those
judgments
reviewed
by
courts
all
over
the
country.
and
the
attorney
general
has
determined
that
not...
because
it's
not
compelled
by
the
language,
she
elects
not
to
impose
that
interpretive
and
administrative
thicket
on
the
withholding
provision.
i
would
like
to--
ms.
petitioner
patricia
a
millett
--and
so
the
attorney
general
is
here
opposing
the
adoption
of
a
necessity
test.
ms.
petitioner
patricia
a
millett
no,
it
would
not,
for
two
reasons.
first
of
all,
it's
the
ninth
circuit
that
wants
to
look
at
necessity
and
success,
not
the
board.
the
board's
reference
to
the
fact--
ms.
petitioner
patricia
a
millett
--well,
i...
the
board's
reference...
the
board's
reference
to
the
level,
attracting
the
attention
of
the
governments
was
not
to
say
you're
disqualified
because
of
that,
but
to
use
that
to
describe
how
much
violence
was
involved
against
civilians
here.
there
was
sufficient
violence
against
civilians
that
it
would
attract
this
atten...
this
level
of
attention,
so
that
is
again
evidence
this
was
not,
as
the
ninth
circuit
characterized,
minimal
or
harmless
violence--
ms.
petitioner
patricia
a
millett
--the
level
of
violence
targeted
at
civilians
is
what
was
done.
i
would
like
to
reserve
the--
ms.
petitioner
patricia
a
millett
--violence
against
civilians,
in
this
case,
yes,
the
board--
ms.
petitioner
patricia
a
millett
--i'm
sorry.
is...
i'm
sorry.
ms.
petitioner
patricia
a
millett
the
test
is
either
proportion...
a
proportionality
between
the
objective
and
the
means
used,
or...
or
atrociousness.
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
ms.
petitioner
patricia
a
millett
absolutely
not.
the
position
was
taken
in
rodriguez-coto,
it
needed
to
be
taken
there
because
he
had
committed
crimes
in
cuba
and
in
the
united
states;
those
had
to
be
addressed
and,
if
nothing
else,
the
attorney
general's
position
is
clearly
reflected
in
our
brief
in
this
case.
now,
the
reason
it
was
not
mentioned
specifically
in
the
board's
decision
is...
i
would
like
this
court
to
keep
in
mind
that
the
respondent
didn't
file
a
brief
before
the
board
of
immigration
appeals,
so
before
this
court
sends
it
back
for
the
board
to
do
it
again,
please
keep
that
in
mind.
secondly,
on
the
question
of
the
test,
and
was
it
correctly
applied,
and
consistently,
i'd
like
to
refer
the
court
to
petition
appendix
17a,
18a,
where
the
test
is
quoted.
the
carry-over
paragraph
at
the
top
of
17a,
right
near
the
end,
in
evaluating
the
political
nature
of
a
crime,
we
consider
it
important
that
the--
ms.
petitioner
patricia
a
millett
--petition
appendix.
we
consider
it
important
that
the
political
aspect
of
the
offense
outweigh
its
common
law
character.
where
the
phrase
grossly
out
of
proportion
comes
in
is
simply
in
the
next
sentence
as
an
example
of
something
that
would
be
outweighed.
grossly
out
of
proportion
is
not
the
test.
it
is
proportionality
or
atrociousness.
the
ninth
circuit
made
it,
and,
and
we
believe
that
they
should
not
have
done
that.
second,
the
discussion
in
the
following
paragraph,
right
under
analysis
and
conclusions,
and
then
on
the
next
page,
18a,
there's
an
entire
paragraph
saying
why
that
balancing
was
struck
against
the
respondent
in
this
case.
now,
not
only
did
they
not
file
a
brief,
but...
it
is
our
position
that
some
crimes
don't
require
a
lot
of
explanation,
and
that
masked
men
wielding
sticks,
lobbing
stones,
forcing
people
out
of
stores,
destroying
stores,
and
splashing
gasoline
on
buses
and
setting
them
on
fire
doesn't
require
a
lot
more
than
what
the
board
said
here.
ms.
petitioner
patricia
a
millett
the
answer
under
the
withholding
of
deportation
provision
would
be
the
same.
however,
as
we
reference
in
our
reply
brief,
there
is
now
a
torture
on
convention
that
the
united
states
is
a
party
to,
and
that
the
immigration
and
naturalization
service
has
recently
issued
regulations
on,
and
that
sets
up
a
procedure--

petitioner
patricia

--convention
on
torture.
ms.

and
that
sets
up
the
regulations,
which
i
would
be
happy
to
lodge
with
the
court
if
it's
interested,

up
a
procedure
called

of

for

who
is

from

of

but

and
meet
the
convention's
definition
of
torture.
ms.
petitioner
patricia
a
millett
the
problem
is
that--
ms.
petitioner
patricia
a
millett
--the
problem
is
that
in
addition
to
balancing
the
risk
of
persecution
the
ninth
circuit
added
two
new
factors,
and
it
is
not
at
all
clear
to
us
that
those
are
not
intended
to
weigh
upon
this
political
analysis.
two
new
factors
to
add
on
top
of
this
disproportionate
analysis.
ms.
petitioner
patricia
a
millett
one
is
changing
the
or
atrocious
to
and
atrocious,
or
and
approaching
atrociousness.
secondly
is
necessity
and
success.
now,
maybe
they
would
come
under
both
factors,
but
it's...
i
think
it's
critically
important
that
this
court
hold
that
the
attorney
general
is
not
compelled
to
adopt
those
standards.
thank
you.
