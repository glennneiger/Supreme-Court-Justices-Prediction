ms.
nadine
k.
wettstein
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i'd
like
to
pick
up
on
the
point
we
just
left
off
with
ms.
millett,
that
in
answer
to
justice
kennedy's
question
the
court
does
not
have
to
grapple
or
decide
on
the
difficult,
what
is
a
political
crime,
what
is
not
a
political
crime.
the
issue
really
facing
the
court
is
whether
or
not
the
board
of
immigration
appeals
properly
reversed
the
decision
of
the
immigration
judge.
ms.
nadine
k.
wettstein
well,
your
honor--
ms.
nadine
k.
wettstein
--your
honor,
the
bia...
rather,
the
court
of
appeals
gave
three
reasons
for
reversing
the
bia,
and
two
of
those
three
reasons
were
that
the
board
did
not
correctly
apply
its
own
test
set
out
in
the
matter
of
mcmullen,
which
is
a
bia
decision
setting
forth
the
standards
for
determining
serious
nonpolitical
crime.
and
to
just
clarify
with
justice
ginsburg
for
a
moment,
nobody
says
that
this
is
a
political
crime.
everyone
said
that
this
was
a...
rather,
no
one
said
it's
a
nonpolitical
crime.
everyone
said
it's
a
political
crime.
the
board...
the
immigration
judge
held
that
it
was
a
political
crime.
the
board
of
immigration
appeals
did
not
say
that
it
was
on
balance.
it
said
on
balance
that
it
was
too
serious
to
be
political,
but
it
didn't
say
that
the
motives
were
unpolitical,
or
nonpolitical.
in
other
words,
the
board
misapplied
its
own...
well,
the
board
purported
to
apply
the
mcmullen
test,
and
it
did
not
apply
the
five
factors
of
the
mcmullen
test,
it
only
concluded
as
to
one
factor.
ms.
nadine
k.
wettstein
your
honor,
mcmullen
mirrors
and
incorporates
the
handbook
standard,
paragraph
152
of
the
handbook,
which
sets
out
five
tests,
and
when
you
apply
those
tests
in
this
case--
ms.
nadine
k.
wettstein
--well,
your
honor,
there
are
two
different
kinds
of
balancing
here.
perhaps
if
we
separate
them,
that
might
be
clearer.
there's
a
balancing,
the
so-called
balancing
in
paragraph
152
of
the
handbook,
if
we
may
call
it
that,
and
that
really
is...
provides
five
tests
for
the
political-nonpolitical
question.
and
then
there's
the
separate
question
in
paragraph
156
of
the
handbook,
which
is
whether
or
not
you
consider
the
risk
of
persecution
once
you
have
already
determined
that
the
crime
is--
ms.
nadine
k.
wettstein
--yes,
your
honor,
that's
certainly
agreed,
but
the
board
has
adopted
the
paragraph
152
in
the
matter
of
mcmullen,
so
it
wouldn't
necessarily
be
bound
otherwise,
but--
ms.
nadine
k.
wettstein
--it's
a
balancing
of
the
political-nonpolitical
question,
your
honor.
it
includes
the
motivation
of
the
actor,
whether
or
not
the
crime
was
out
of
proportion,
whether
or
not
there's
a
causal
link
between
the
acts
and
the
goals,
whether
or
not
the
crime
was
atrocious.
so
in
answer
to
some
of
the
court's
questions
earlier--
ms.
nadine
k.
wettstein
--that's
right.
ms.
nadine
k.
wettstein
whether
the
act
is
out
of
proportion
to
the
goals.
the
question
in
15...
in
the
152
handbook
is
whether
or
not
this
is
a
political
crime,
so
if
it's
out
of
proportion,
i
think
that
was
some
of
what...
an
answer
to
some
of
your
questions
earlier
about
killing
someone
that,
you
may
have
a
valid
political
goal,
but
if
you
overstep
your
bounds,
if
you
did
too
much
to
meet
that
goal,
then
the
crime
loses
its
political
character.
it
becomes
a
nonpolitical
crime.
ms.
nadine
k.
wettstein
well,
mcmullen,
your
honor,
is
the
chief
board
decision
about
this.
this
has
not...
this
issue
has
not
come
up
very
often
in
the
board.
there
are
some
early
cases
in
the
early
eighties
with
marielito
cubans.
this
issue
did
not
really
come
up
with
those,
in
those
cases.
there
have
been...
this
issue
has
come
up
in
the
extradition
context,
and
there
are
some
district
court
cases
in
a
case
called
doherty
and
also
in
mcmullen,
where
extradition
was
refused
because
they
were
political
crimes,
and--
ms.
nadine
k.
wettstein
--no,
your
honor,
but
mcmullen
is
the
board's
own
decision
deciding
what
the
statute
means,
and--
ms.
nadine
k.
wettstein
--well,
your
honor,
to
return
to
the
chief
justice's
question
earlier,
the
question
is,
was
the
court
of
appeals
correct.
and
the
court
of
appeals
said,
here
are
the
tests
that
you
have
laid
out,
and
here
is
circuit
law,
and
here
is
how
these
tests
are
supposed
to
be
applied,
and
you
did
not
correctly
apply
them
in
this
case.
ms.
nadine
k.
wettstein
well,
you
certainly
can
do
that,
your
honor.
the
statute
itself
only
says,
serious
nonpolitical
crimes.
so
the
court
could
say
you
don't
like
the
mcmullen
test,
and
you
think
some
other
test
should
apply.
but,
of
course,
no
one
was
able
to
apply
that
new
test
in
this
case,
so
then
a
remand
would
be
appropriate
if
you--
ms.
nadine
k.
wettstein
--that's
correct.
ms.
nadine
k.
wettstein
right,
but
she
has
not
done
that
here.
the
attorney
general,
neither
on
the
156
political
crime
balancing
nor
on
the
risk
of
persecution
balancing,
the
attorney
general
has
not
issued
any
precedent
decisions
on
either
of
these
questions.
her
decision
is
limited
to
mcmullen,
and
in
the
mcmullen
decision
the
risk
of
persecution
balancing
did
not
come
up.
ms.
nadine
k.
wettstein
right.
ms.
nadine
k.
wettstein
that's
correct.
ms.
nadine
k.
wettstein
well,
yes,
your
honor,
i
think
the
government
would
agree
that
the
prior
rule
is
matter
of
mcmullen,
and
there
has
been
no
other
decision
by
the
attorney
general.
ms.
nadine
k.
wettstein
well,
your
honor,
since
mcmullen
is...
was
the
precedent
decision
here,
i
think
if
the
board--
ms.
nadine
k.
wettstein
--she
certainly
could
do
that.
ms.
nadine
k.
wettstein
well,
your
honor,
she
has,
in
fact,
done
that
in
a
case
where--
ms.
nadine
k.
wettstein
--well,
the
attorney
general,
your
honor,
is...
has
authority
over
the
board
of
immigration
appeals.
as
you've
noted,
the
board
is
a
creature
of
the
attorney
general,
so
at
least
under
the
statute
she
can
overrule
a
decision
the
board
of
immigration
appeals
has
made.
ms.
nadine
k.
wettstein
without
focusing
on
it.
ms.
nadine
k.
wettstein
well--
ms.
nadine
k.
wettstein
--arizona
grocery.
[laughter]
arizona
grocery.
ms.
nadine
k.
wettstein
well,
we
don't
even
have
to
reach
that
here,
of
course.
ms.
nadine
k.
wettstein
right.
ms.
nadine
k.
wettstein
well,
i
don't
think
we
even
have
to
reach
that
here,
because
the
board
did
not
purport
to
change
its
policy.
ms.
nadine
k.
wettstein
uh-huh,
that
it
was...
the
criminal
nature
outweighed
the
political
nature.
ms.
nadine
k.
wettstein
but
your
honor,
that's
all
they
said.
they
just
simply
announced
it,
and
they
violated
another
cardinal
principle
of
administrative
law
that
the
agency
is
supposed
to
show
that
it
reasoned
and
not
merely
reacted,
and
here
the
agency
just
simply
concluded,
so
it
isn't
as
if
they
overturned
mcmullen,
or...
they
purported
to
apply
mcmullen,
but
they
did
not
adequately
apply...
they
did
not--
ms.
nadine
k.
wettstein
--well,
your
honor,
in
this
case,
certainly
if
they
had
properly
applied
the
tests
they
would
have
reached
a
separate...
a
different
result.
they
simply
concluded
that
the
political
element
outweighed
the
criminal
element,
but
if
they
had
considered
whether
mr.
aguirre
had
political
motivation,
whether
there
was
a
link
between
his
acts
and
the
goals,
they
would
have
reached
a
separate
decision.
so
yes,
i
think
the
facts...
if
it
were...
was
just
a
fact
determination,
if
they
had
properly
applied
their
tests,
they
would
have
reached
a
different
determination.
ms.
nadine
k.
wettstein
that's
right.
ms.
nadine
k.
wettstein
yes,
it
did,
your
honor.
ms.
nadine
k.
wettstein
that's
right.
ms.
nadine
k.
wettstein
it
applied
the
gross,
and
it
also
applied
the
atrociousness
test.
so
it
applied
both
of
those
tests
and
found
that
mcmullen's
actions,
contrary
to
mr.
aguirre's
actions,
were
in
fact
grossly
disproportionate
and
were
atrocious,
and--
ms.
nadine
k.
wettstein
--no,
your
honor,
they
didn't
say
it
was
a
condition,
but
it
does...
those
were
the
tests
that
they
applied,
and
that
again
mirrors--
ms.
nadine
k.
wettstein
--i'm
sorry,
your
honor.
ms.
nadine
k.
wettstein
yes.
ms.
nadine
k.
wettstein
that's
right.
ms.
nadine
k.
wettstein
they
did
not
say,
this
is
an
absolute
condition,
but
they
said,
here
is
what
we
consider,
and
what
they
consider
mirrors
the
handbook--
ms.
nadine
k.
wettstein
--well,
your
honor--
ms.
nadine
k.
wettstein
--uh-huh.
ms.
nadine
k.
wettstein
your
honor,
i
don't
want
to
mischaracterize
what
i
said.
it
isn't
that
the
board
in
mcmullen
said
it
isn't
a
necessary
factor.
those
are
the
factors
they
considered.
they
didn't
say
which
ones
of
those
are
necessary
and
which
ones
are
not--
ms.
nadine
k.
wettstein
--so
it
may
be
that's
a
necessary
factor.
ms.
nadine
k.
wettstein
well,
your
honor,
it
isn't
so
much
a
factual
determination
here
as
a
procedural
determination.
the
ninth
circuit
did
not
reach
its
own
substantive
conclusion.
it
simply
remanded
to
the
board
for
it
to
apply
its
test,
so
it's
really
more
procedural
errors.
ms.
nadine
k.
wettstein
well,
your
honor,
the
statute
does
not
say,
and
the
government
seems
to
be
trying
to
read
into
the
statute,
the
word
civilians,
or
noncivilians.
the
statute
doesn't
exempt
political
actions
taken
that
happen
to
affect
civilians.
ms.
nadine
k.
wettstein
i
would
agree
with
that,
your
honor,
but
that
does
not
mean
that
actions
that
by
necessity
are
diffused,
and
not
as
they
were
in
guatemala...
it
wasn't
as
if
you
had
an
armed
insurrection
against--
ms.
nadine
k.
wettstein
--mm-hmm.
ms.
nadine
k.
wettstein
yes,
your
honor,
but
as
in
one
of
the
other
amicus
briefs,
the
buses
were
not
just
simply
privately
owned.
the
government
had
enormous
involvement
in
the
bus--
ms.
nadine
k.
wettstein
--that's
true,
your
honor,
but
of
course--
ms.
nadine
k.
wettstein
--the
goal
here
was
to
prevent
harm
to
the
passengers,
not
to
hurt
the
passengers.
the
passengers
were
not
targeted.
ms.
nadine
k.
wettstein
i'm
sorry?
ms.
nadine
k.
wettstein
well,
no,
the
buses...
the
people
were
moved
off
the
buses
before
the
buses
were
moved,
your
honor.
that
was
the
goal
of
moving
the
passengers,
so
they
would
not
be
harmed.
the
goal
was
to
prevent
greater
harm
to
the
passengers.
the
buses
were
burned
as
a
protest
of
the
100-percent
bus
fare
increases,
which
the
government
approved.
the
government
in
guatemala
approves
the
bus
fare
increases.
it
regulates
the
bus
routes,
it
regulates
the--
ms.
nadine
k.
wettstein
--well,
your
honor,
obviously
in
this
country
in
this
day
and
age
we
don't
like
these
acts.
these
acts
are
offensive
to
us,
but
that's
not
really
the
test.
the
test
is,
under
the
conditions
that
mr.
aguirre
found
himself
in
guatemala,
was
this
out
of
proportion
to
his
political
goals?
ms.
nadine
k.
wettstein
your
honor,
the
principle
that
you
mentioned
earlier,
which
is--
ms.
nadine
k.
wettstein
--uh-huh.
ms.
nadine
k.
wettstein
right.
well,
your
honor,
the
board
itself
has
said
on
numerous
occasions
that
the
immigration
judge's
decision
is
itself
entitled
to
deference,
because
the
immigration
judge
is
the
one
who
observes
the
witness,
and
that's
certainly
what
happened
here,
and
heard
the
testimony,
including
the
mistakes
in
the
testimony.
ms.
nadine
k.
wettstein
yes,
it
is,
your
honor,
because
after
all
the
court
of
appeals
gave
three
reasons
for
reversing
the
board.
and
two
of
those
reasons,
the
first
two
of
those
reasons
were
the
failure
to
apply
its
previous
precedent
and
the
ninth
circuit
precedent.
the
third
reason
was
the
persecution
balancing,
and
that's
what's
the
balance
of
the
government's
brief
and,
of
course,
the
balance--
ms.
nadine
k.
wettstein
--yes,
your
honor,
it
certainly
was.
if
you'd
like
me
to
point
to
that
section
of
the
brief--
ms.
nadine
k.
wettstein
--okay.
ms.
nadine
k.
wettstein
beginning
on
page
29
of
our
brief--
ms.
nadine
k.
wettstein
--your
honor,
there's
a
correct
standard
for--
ms.
nadine
k.
wettstein
--of...
sorry,
of
our
brief.
ms.
nadine
k.
wettstein
of
the
respondent's
brief,
and--
ms.
nadine
k.
wettstein
--well,
i
thought
he
was
asking
about--
ms.
nadine
k.
wettstein
--the
issue
was
whether
the
case
concerned...
in
other
words...
we're
arguing
that
the
court
of
appeals
did
not...
that
the
board's
failure
to
apply
properly
the...
it's
own
test
was--
ms.
nadine
k.
wettstein
--i
think
it
certainly
was
in
the
court
of
appeals
decision
too,
your
honor.
if
we
look
at--
ms.
nadine
k.
wettstein
--no,
i
have
it
here.
ms.
nadine
k.
wettstein
yes.
it's...
this
is
in
the
petition
for
certiorari,
page
5a,
4a
and
5a.
the
court
said--
ms.
nadine
k.
wettstein
--let's
see,
4a
on
the
second
full
paragraph.
first,
the
board
looked
only
at
the
offenses
of
aguirre,
et
cetera.
under
the
protocol,
the
board
should
have
first
determined
the
nature
and
purpose
of
aguirre's
acts,
that
is,
whether
they
were
committed
out
of
genuine
political
motives...
this
is
in
the
mcmullen--
ms.
nadine
k.
wettstein
--well,
i
think
that's
putting
it
generously,
your
honor.
if
you
say
that
the
board
did
not
apply
the
proper
rule,
that's
actually
what
the
court
accused
them
of
having
done,
and
that's
what
we
accuse
them
of
having
done,
too,
but
i
think
the
question
here
is,
if
they
applied
the
proper
rule
but
didn't
explain
themselves
correctly.
ms.
nadine
k.
wettstein
well,
i
think,
your
honor,
because
the
ninth
circuit
assumed
that
there
were
tests
in
place.
now,
justice
breyer's
question
was
that,
let's
assume
there
are
no
tests
in
place,
but
the
court
had
a
test
to
work
with,
so
it
was
not
dealing
with
the
situation
you
suggested,
which
is
where
there's
no
test.
and
then
you
say,
well,
you
just
didn't
explain
yourself
correctly,
but
in
fact
this
is
worse--
ms.
nadine
k.
wettstein
--well--
ms.
nadine
k.
wettstein
--no,
your
honor,
because
the
court
had
more
to
work
with.
the
court
had
the
test
that
the
board
did
not
apply,
that
justice
breyer
wrote
out
of
our
hypothetical.
so
therefore
the
court
didn't
have
to
say,
there's
no
test
here
but
you
just
didn't
explain
yourself,
because
the
court
had
something
more
concrete
to
use,
which
was,
here's
this
test,
you
have
adopted
the
test,
you
didn't
apply
the
test,
go
back
and
do
it.
that's
really
what
the
court
said.
ms.
nadine
k.
wettstein
no,
your
honor.
in
fact,
the
attorney
general
has
not
determined
that
question,
so
it
may
be
appropriate
to
remand
to
the
attorney
general
to
determine
that
question
in
the
first
instance,
whether,
in
fact,
the
risk
of
persecution
needs
to
be
considered
when
you're
applying
this
exclusion
ground,
so
this
court
certainly
does
not
have
to
reach
that
question.
ms.
nadine
k.
wettstein
right.
the
only
precedential
decision
that
the
government
cites
for
that
position
is
matter
of
rodriguez-coto,
your
honor,
which
is
a
1985
decision,
has
never
been
cited
again
for
that
principle,
and
in
fact--
ms.
nadine
k.
wettstein
--well,
your
honor,
the
case
did
not...
rejected
the
balancing
test
for
two
different
exclusion
grounds,
and
it
did
not...
the
case
itself
did
not
deal
with
this
exclusion
ground,
and
it
has
never
come
up
subsequently.
and
the
attorney...
so
there
has
never
been
an
opportunity,
in
fact,
the
board
here
in
this
case
didn't
decide
it,
either,
so
there's
never
been
an
opportunity
for
the
attorney
general
to
make
a
decision.
now,
the
attorney
general
could
have
drafted
regulations
adopting
one
position
or
another,
but
that
has
not
happened,
so
there
actually
is
no
precedent.
ms.
nadine
k.
wettstein
right.
no,
your
honor,
i'm
not
saying
the
language
itself
they
use
there
is
ambiguous.
i'm
simply
saying
that
the
board...
that
was...
this
was
not
the
issue
in
that
case,
and
so
it's
dictum
for
that
reason.
it's
also
dictum
for
the
other
reason
that
the
board
had
three
other
reasons
for
its
decision
in
that
case
before
it
got
to
this.
that
case
dealt
with--
ms.
nadine
k.
wettstein
--that's
correct,
your
honor,
and
i
think
the
board
would
say
it
was
not
bound
by
rodriguez-coto
if
it
wanted
to
reach
the
opposite
decision.
thank
you.
