ms.
pamela
a.
rumpz
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
to
be
clear,
strickler
never
raised
a
freestanding
brady
violation
in
the
state
court.
to
be
clear,
he
never
sought
discovery
of
any
sort
of
brady
materials
in
the
state
post
conviction
court.
ms.
pamela
a.
rumpz
if
you
accept
that
what
the
state
did
was
misrepresentation,
and
if
you
accept--
ms.
pamela
a.
rumpz
--all
right.
if
you
accept
that
that's
what
the
state's
representations
were,
and
if
you
accept
that
this
is
indeed
brady
material,
then
that's
a
different
question,
but
that's
not
what
we
have
here.
we
have
a
prosecutor
who
asserted
at
trial
that
he
had
an
open
file
and
nothing
else.
we
proceed
to
state
post
conviction
court.
he
is
appointed
state
post
conviction
lawyers
11
months
before
he
files
a
state
habeas
petition,
and
he
files
the
state
habeas
petition
2-1/2
months
before
the
state
ever
makes
any
sort
of
representation
in
its
motion
to
dismiss
that
brady
material
was
turned
over.
ms.
pamela
a.
rumpz
in
my
view
at
the
time
of
the
representation
in
state
habeas?
ms.
pamela
a.
rumpz
absolutely.
at
the
time
he
filed
his
petition
in
the
state
habeas--
ms.
pamela
a.
rumpz
--first
of
all,
as
someone
here
pointed
out
earlier
this
morning,
an
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel
claim
for
failure
to
seek
brady
motion
was
made
in
the
state
habeas
petition,
thereby
alerting
the
state
post
conviction
counsel,
or
giving
rise
to
an
inference
that
this
ought
to
be
something
that
should
have
been
looked
into.
but
more
important--
ms.
pamela
a.
rumpz
--you
have--
ms.
pamela
a.
rumpz
--no.
no.
the
virginia
rule
for
discovery
in
state
post
conviction
is
almost
identical
to
rule
6a
in
the
federal
court.
you
have
to
do
it
with
leave
of
the
court,
and
you
have
to
establish
some
sort
of
good
cause.
so
it's
always
been
the
commonwealth's
position
that
whatever
was
asserted
in
the
federal
district
court
after
the
statement
had
been
made
certainly
could
have
been
asserted
at
the
inception
of
state
post
conviction--
ms.
pamela
a.
rumpz
--as
the
fourth
circuit
noted
in
its
opinion,
the
fact
that
ann
stoltzfus
had
testified
during
cross
examination
that
she
had
spoken
with
detective
claytor
a
number
of
times
certainly
should
have
alerted
a
reasonable,
diligent
state
habeas
lawyer
that
they
needed
to
investigate
further
into
what
she
might
have
said.
ms.
pamela
a.
rumpz
yes,
and
that
that
representation,
coupled
with
the
fact
that
prior
to
trial,
the
sunday
before
trial
began,
ms.
stoltzfus
gave
a
detailed
interview
to
the
roanoke
times
newspaper.
and
in
that
interview
she...
there
are
statements
attributable
to
her
which
do
not...
which
are
different
from
what
she
testified
to
at
trial.
so
we
do
have
differing
statements
in
the
public
record
which
strickler
knew
about
attributable
to
ann
stoltzfus.
in
addition,
shortly
after
the
conclusion
of
trial,
ms.
stoltzfus
wrote
a
letter
to
another
newspaper,
and
she
talked
about
her
sometimes
muddled
memories
and
how
the
police
had
helped
her
get
a
big,
whole
picture
of
what
she
had
witnessed
there
at
the
mall.
so
when
you
are--
ms.
pamela
a.
rumpz
--the
position
is...
well,
that
is
the
statement
that
was
made.
ms.
pamela
a.
rumpz
i
don't
think
that
can
be
taken,
first
of
all,
as
an
unequivocal
statement
for
a
number
of
reasons.
first
of
all--
ms.
pamela
a.
rumpz
--it
may
be
a
natural
reading,
but
interestingly
enough
it
was
not
the
reading
by
either
of
the
parties
in
this
case.
it
wasn't
intended
that
way
by
the
warden
and,
as
strickler
acknowledged--
ms.
pamela
a.
rumpz
--well,
all
right,
assuming
that
this
is...
that
is
exactly
how
counsel
could
have
understood
it,
as
an
unequivocal
admission
that
there
were
no
further
brady
motion,
the
reason
why
it
can't
operate
as
cause
in
this
case
is
very
simple.
the
timing
of
the
statement
was
made
2-1/2
months
after
strickler
filed
his
state
habeas
petition,
which
contained
no
claim
of
brady
error.
ms.
pamela
a.
rumpz
well,
i
have
to
disagree.
i
don't
believe
that
a
separate
and
distinct
allegation
of
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel
for
failing
or
not
doing
something
raises--
ms.
pamela
a.
rumpz
--a
distinct
claim.
ms.
pamela
a.
rumpz
i
guess
i'm
not
following
you.
ms.
pamela
a.
rumpz
well,
i
think
that's
true.
ms.
pamela
a.
rumpz
and
if
they
had
made
the
required
good
cause
threshold
showing
in
state
court
they
would
have
or
could
have
been
entitled
to
have
their
claim
decided
in
the
federal
courts.
ms.
pamela
a.
rumpz
but
they
didn't.
ms.
pamela
a.
rumpz
in
the
state
post
conviction
proceedings?
ms.
pamela
a.
rumpz
yes,
i
do.
he
filed
his
state
habeas
corpus
petition
in
the
augusta
county
circuit
court
in
september
of
1992.
we
filed
our
motion
to
dismiss
2-1/2
months
later
in
november
of
1992.
ms.
pamela
a.
rumpz
i
think
i
do.
ms.
pamela
a.
rumpz
the
state
took
the
position
that
everything
they
were
entitled
to...
i
guess
the
question
assumes
that--
ms.
pamela
a.
rumpz
--well,
i'd
like
to
take
that
position.
ms.
pamela
a.
rumpz
in
this
case,
no,
it
definitely
would
not.
but
i
guess
your
question,
justice
stevens,
assumes
that
the
evidence
is
brady
material.
and
the
commonwealth's
position
has
always
been
that
this
evidence
is
not
brady
material.
now,
the
statement
by
the
warden
could
have
been
a
reflection
that
there
was
nothing
to
be
disclosed
because
none
of
this
is
brady
material,
and
that--
ms.
pamela
a.
rumpz
--did
the
state
habeas
lawyers--
ms.
pamela
a.
rumpz
--representing
the
commonwealth
know?
actually,
i'm
not
clear
whether
they
did
or
didn't.
i
think
no.
ms.
pamela
a.
rumpz
the
prosecutor
didn't
know
of
the
five
documents
at
the
time
of
trial.
he
had
interrogatories
where
he
says
that
he's
never
seen
those
five
documents
before.
ms.
pamela
a.
rumpz
absolutely
not.
ms.
pamela
a.
rumpz
no.
virginia
law
does
not
require
the
disclosure
of
mere
witness
statements.
ms.
pamela
a.
rumpz
brady,
of
course,
virginia
is
required
to
with...
to
disclose--
ms.
pamela
a.
rumpz
--i'll
assume
that.
i
won't
agree
with
that,
but
i
will
assume
that.
ms.
pamela
a.
rumpz
well,
in
this
case
especially,
i
mean,
the
lawyers...
of
course,
under
virginia
law
he
wasn't
absolutely
entitled
to
these
statements.
ms.
pamela
a.
rumpz
well,
sure.
if--
ms.
pamela
a.
rumpz
--he
certainly
could
have
asked
the
judge
to
review
them
in
camera.
he
certainly
could
have
probed
ann
stoltzfus'
testimony
more
when
she
said,
hey,
every
time
i
spoke
to
the
police
it
was
detective
claytor.
he
could
have
talked
to
detective
claytor
about
it--
ms.
pamela
a.
rumpz
--no.
ms.
pamela
a.
rumpz
no.
ms.
pamela
a.
rumpz
i'll
be
happy
to
do
that
right
now.
ms.
pamela
a.
rumpz
there
is,
for
the
same
reasons
that
the
fourth
circuit
found
that
there
was
no
prejudice
is
also
why
there
is
no
merit
to
the
brady
claim.
first
of
all,
it's...
the
district
court
accepted
as
true,
as
true,
the
affidavit
of
thomas
roberts,
which
said
that
strickler
was
aware,
or
the
defense
team
was
aware
at
the
time
of
trial
that
stoltzfus'
testimony
had
evolved
over
time
and
that
he
was
aware
of
the
information
contained
in
the
stoltzfus
materials.
now,
contrary
to
what
counsel
said
here
this
morning,
mr.
roberts'
affidavit
didn't
say,
i
don't
recall
seeing
these
documents.
he
said,
i
don't
know
whether
i've
seen
them.
i
don't
remember
whether
i've
seen
them,
but
i
know
that
i
knew
what
was
in
them,
and
i
know
that
we
were
aware
at
the
time
of
trial
that
her
testimony
had
apparently
evolved.
ms.
pamela
a.
rumpz
and
i
stand
corrected.
the
fourth
circuit
did
not
mention
the
affidavit
of
thomas
roberts.
ms.
pamela
a.
rumpz
first
of
all,
under
virginia
law
it
doesn't
matter
who
dropped
the
rock.
ms.
pamela
a.
rumpz
stoltzfus'--
ms.
pamela
a.
rumpz
--in
virginia--
ms.
pamela
a.
rumpz
--in
virginia
there's
what's
called
the
joint
triggerman
rule.
if
both
participants
participate
equally
in
inflicting
the
fatal
blows,
they
are
both
guilty
of
capital
murder.
ms.
pamela
a.
rumpz
it
certainly
would.
ms.
pamela
a.
rumpz
but
ann
stoltzfus'
testimony
certainly
doesn't
establish
that
once
they
reached
that
field--
ms.
pamela
a.
rumpz
--well,
it--
ms.
pamela
a.
rumpz
--it
was
the--
ms.
pamela
a.
rumpz
--it
was
the
commonwealth's
position
at
trial,
and
perhaps
you
have
to
see
the
rock
to
understand,
but
it
was
the
commonwealth's
position
at
trial
that
both
parties
would
have
had
to
participate
in
this
killing.
the
rock
was
a
large,
69-pound-plus
boulder
that
was
long
and
narrow
and
required
a
substantial
effort--
ms.
pamela
a.
rumpz
--yes,
required
two
arms
at
least
to
hold
the
rock,
and
then
to
actually--
ms.
pamela
a.
rumpz
--and
actually
somebody
would
have
had
to
hold
her
down
to--
ms.
pamela
a.
rumpz
--i
guess
it's
possible,
but
i
think...
i,
of
course,
stand
to
be
corrected,
but
i
believe
that
there's
testimony
in...
from
the
medical
examiner
that
indicates
that
probably
the
first
blow
with
the
rock
rendered
her
unconscious
and
she
didn't
feel
the
other
blows.
now,
whether
the
medical
examiner
was
asked
whether
she
was
unconscious
at
the
time
of
that
first
blow,
i
can't
recollect.
i'm
sorry.
ms.
pamela
a.
rumpz
i
don't
think
so
for
a
couple
of
reasons.
first
of
all,
we
know
that
strickler
was
the
one
driving
the
car
when
he
entered
the
field
where
whitlock
was
eventually
murdered.
and
second
of
all,
we
know
that
strickler's
hairs
appeared,
or
hairs
microscopically
identical
in
all
respects
to
mr.
strickler's
appeared
on
whitlock's
discarded
clothing,
and
those
hairs--
ms.
pamela
a.
rumpz
--no.
ms.
pamela
a.
rumpz
i
don't
believe
that
there
was.
ms.
pamela
a.
rumpz
my
strongest
case
is
that
strickler
was
placed
at
the
mall
by
two
other
independent
witnesses
at
the
time
that
leanne
whitlock
was
due
to
return
her
boyfriend's
car
to
that
very
same
mall.
strickler
was
seen
heading
towards
the
exit
of
that
mall
at
the
same
time
that
whitlock
was
due
to
return
that
car
to
the
mall.
now,
if
you
take
out
everything
that
ann
stoltzfus
saw
after
that--
ms.
pamela
a.
rumpz
--they
were
the
mall
security
guard,
virginia
smith,
who
had
received
a
report
that
two
white
males
had
been
earlier
trying
to
steal
a
lincoln
continental
from
the
mall
parking
lot.
she
identified
those
males
as
strickler
and
henderson,
and
then
she
proceeded
to
watch
them
for
the
remainder
of
the
afternoon.
ms.
pamela
a.
rumpz
well--
ms.
pamela
a.
rumpz
--well,
strickler
has
never
claimed
that
stoltzfus'
testimony
was
in
any
way
material
to
the
sentencing.
ms.
pamela
a.
rumpz
i
guess
my
response
is,
as
i
said
earlier
to
another
question,
that
under
virginia
law
both
participants
were
equally
culpable
and
equally
guilty
of
capital
murder.
ms.
pamela
a.
rumpz
uh
huh.
ms.
pamela
a.
rumpz
well,
i
guess
i
do
disagree
with
that
for
a
number
of
reasons.
first
of
all,
ann
stoltzfus
still
would
have
testified,
and
she
still
would
have
testified
that
that's
what
she
saw.
now,
assuming
that
this...
she
would
have
been
impeached
with
this
material,
her
testimony
is
still
there,
and
the
jury
still
knows
what
she
saw.
ms.
pamela
a.
rumpz
second
of
all--
ms.
pamela
a.
rumpz
--strickler
was
found
eligible
for
the
death
penalty
because
he
was
future
dangerousness...
he
was
future
dangerous.
he
had
12
prior
crimes
that
were
used
to
prove
his
future
dangerous,
and
because
his
crime
was--
ms.
pamela
a.
rumpz
--and
because
his
crime
was
vile.
and
i
think
that
when
you...
whoever
dropped
the
rock,
when
you
kidnap
a
woman,
when
you
take
her
out
into
a
remote
field,
you
drop
a
rock
on
her
head
four
times
so
badly
that
her
skull
is
embedded
in
her
brain,
and
there
are
indentations
inches
deep
on
the
ground
full
of
blood,
that
the
fact
that
an
earlier
witness
is
impeached
may
affect
the
jury's
ultimate
sentencing
decision
is
quite
a
stretch.
ms.
pamela
a.
rumpz
because
henderson
got
the
benefit
of
an
improper
jury
instruction
in
his
trial.
ms.
pamela
a.
rumpz
the...
he
did
not
receive
the
joint
triggerman
instruction,
the
instruction
in
virginia
that
says,
if
both
parties
are
joint
participants
in
inflicting
the
fatal
blows,
each
is
eligible
for
the
death
penalty.
ms.
pamela
a.
rumpz
so--
ms.
pamela
a.
rumpz
--yes.
henderson,
if
he
had
been,
if
his
jury
had
been
instructed
as
strickler's
jury
was
instructed,
then
the
results
of
henderson's
trial
may
have
been
the
same
as
strickler's.
ms.
pamela
a.
rumpz
and...
thank
you,
justice
scalia,
there
is.
there's
a
wealth
of
other
evidence
that
shows
that
he
is
the
one
that
dropped
the
rock
and
that
he
was
the
instigator
and
the
leader.
ms.
pamela
a.
rumpz
tudor.
that's
the
evidence.
ms.
pamela
a.
rumpz
tudor
is
the
evidence,
and--
ms.
pamela
a.
rumpz
--none
that
i
know
of.
i
mean,
there...
the
theory
has
always
been
that
donna
tudor
was
trying
to
protect
herself.
well,
she
could
have
protected
herself
equally
by
ratting
out
henderson
as
opposed
to
strickler,
but
the
fact
of
the
matter
is,
she
testified
that
she
was
riding
around
in
a
car
with
him--
ms.
pamela
a.
rumpz
--her
week
long
boyfriend,
yeah.
ms.
pamela
a.
rumpz
yes,
and
she
did
not
testify
at
henderson's
trial.
she
testified
at
strickler's
trial.
henderson
had
made
a
confession
to
another
gentleman
who
ultimately
was
called
at
strickler's
trial
in
defense
of
strickler,
but
the
commonwealth
called
this
gentleman
to
prove
strick...
to
prove
henderson's
involvement
in
leanne
whitlock's
killing.
tudor
wasn't
needed
in
that
regard.
and
in
strickler's
trial
tudor
was
needed
because
she
was
the
one
that
overhead
him
talk
about
using
a
rock
crusher
on
a
nigger,
and
whitlock,
of
course,
was
black,
so
that
definitely
is
additional
evidence
besides--
ms.
pamela
a.
rumpz
--ann
stoltzfus'
testimony
that
she
was
the...
he
was
the
leader
in
this
crime.
ms.
pamela
a.
rumpz
she
was...
i
believe
she
was
indicted
for
some
sort
of
car
theft.
now,
whether
she
was
ever
convicted
or
tried,
or
those
were
dismissed
is
not
clear
from
this
record.
ms.
pamela
a.
rumpz
she
had
the
victim's
earrings,
and
that's
another,
i
guess,
factor
that
tends
to
show
that
strickler
was
actively
involved
in
what
went
on
in

field,
because
he
had
whitlock's
pearl
earrings
that
she
was
wearing
and--

that's
true,
but--

but
interestingly
enough,
stoltzfus'
testimony
is
enhanced,
or
not
enhanced
but
is
supported
by
strickler's
own
post
verdict
admissions
to
the
trial
judge.
he
admits
that
he
was
at
the
mall.
he
admits
that
he

in

with

at

admits
he
went

scene.

no.
it
definitely
goes
to
the
materiality
of
stoltzfus'
testimony,
because
strickler...
and
in
closing
argument,
additionally,
never
contested
that
any
of
what
stoltzfus
saw
at
the
trial
was
correct,
and
he
couldn't
have.
even
if
he
had--
ms.
pamela

rumpz
--even
if
he
had
impeached
stoltzfus,
even
if
he
had
impeached
stoltzfus
with
his
testimony
he
still
would
have
had
to
explain
why
he
was
at
that
mall,
because
two
other
people
put
him
at
that
mall.
he
still
would
have
had
to
explain
his
possession
of
the
car
not
an
hour
later,
after
what
happened
at
the
mall.
so
her
testimony
becomes
less
critical.

and
he
would
have
had
to
discredit
donna
tudor's
testimony,
and
he
tried
at

he
tried
to
discredit
donna
tudor's
testimony
that--

tudor
wasn't?
ms.
pamela
a.
rumpz
well,
i
see
that
i'm
out
of
time
and
i
guess
i
regret
that
i
can't
answer
that,
but
i
think
they
both
were
important
parts
of
the
commonwealth's
case.
