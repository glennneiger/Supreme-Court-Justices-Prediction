mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
my
client
was
found
guilty
of
abduction,
robbery,
and
capital
murder
on
the
basis
of
testimony
by
a
purported
eye
witness
who
claimed
at
trial
that
he
had
seen
him
forcibly
abduct
the
murder
victim
in
the
parking
lot
of
a
busy
shopping
mall.
that
testimony
went
largely
unimpeached,
because
the
commonwealth
of
virginia
withheld
evidence
that
cast
significant
doubt
on
the
reliability
and
truthfulness
of
the
purported
eye
witness.
my
submission
here
is
twofold.
first,
that
virginia
clearly
violated
the
rule
of
brady
v.
maryland,
by
withhold
material
exculpatory
evidence;
and,
second,
that
there
is
nothing
in
this
court's
habeas
case
law
that
authorizes
the
withholding
of
a
remedy
for
that
clear
violation.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
yes,
it
would.
it
would
cover
the
issues
that
were
framed
as
issues
2
and
3
in
the
court's
order
granting
cert,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
we...
yes,
in
this
case,
justice
scalia,
and
what
i
mean
by
that
is
this.
the
standard
that
applies
to
the
prejudice
issue
under
wainwright
v.
sykes
is
the
same
standard
that
the
court
recognized
in
schlup
v.
delo
that
would
apply
to
the
materiality
issue
under
brady.
there
would
still
remain
the
issue
of
cause.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
it
was
discovered,
justice
scalia,
by
sheer
happenstance.
in
connection
with
a
contemplated
filing
of
federal
habeas,
but
before
any
papers
were
actually
filed
for
federal
habeas,
the
district
court,
under
this
court's
ruling
in
mcfarland
v.
coz,
named
counsel
for
petitioner
so
that
he
could
help
him
with
the
federal
habeas
papers.
the
record
discloses
that
the
district
court
also
issued
an
order
that
was
not
directed
at
any
particular
claim
but
that
did
authorize
new
counsel
to
secure
pretty
much
anything
in
the
world
that
would
have
my
client's
name
on
it,
including
the
files
ultimately
found
to
contain
the
evidence
at
issue
here.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
well--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--no,
justice
scalia.
whether
in
federal
court
or
in
state
court
we
would
have
had
to
make
a
showing
directed
to
the
claim
that
we
were
seeking
to
pursue.
what
the
record
indicates
here
is
that
the
court
issued
an
order
that
was
not
based
on
any
showing,
or
that
was
not...
and
that
did
not
have
in
mind
any
actual
claim.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
no,
justice
scalia,
with
all
due
respect,
that
is
not
actually
correct.
it
was
a
claim--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--well--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--justice
kennedy,
no.
in
fact,
the
factual
bases
for
the
ineffective
assistance
claim
that
was
pled
in
the
state
habeas
is
a
basis
that
would
not
give
us
a
freestanding
brady
claim.
if
you
look
at
what
we
claim
in
state
habeas
is
in
effect
that
counsel
failed
to
do
so
many
things
that
he
was
in
effect
absent,
he
might
as
well
have
been
a
bump
in
the
log,
and
it
was
based
on
a
legal
theory
that
was
wholly
directed
to
the
first
prong
of
the
strickland
test.
in
other
words,
counsel
for
the
state
habeas
case
sat
down
with
the
trial
record
and
in
25
pages
listed
96
instances
of
things
that
the
lawyer
did
not,
that
seemed
from
the
record
were
not
done,
that
tended
to
indicate
that
for
all
intents
and
purposes
he
might
as
well
have
been
not
there.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
yes,
justice
scalia.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
no.
he
was
on
notice
that
counsel
had
failed
to
file
a
motion.
that
is,
i
think,
the
fair
reading
of
the
ineffective
assistance--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--mr.
chief
justice,
that
is
the
legal
theory
under
which
one
would
usually
plead
an
ineffective
assistance
claim.
it
is
possible,
and
it
is
certainly
open
under
this
court's
cases,
to
say
that
someone
who
at
every
turn
failed
to
do
everything
you
would
expect
of
a
lawyer
in
a
criminal
trial
might
as
well
not
have
been
there,
such
that
if
he
was,
indeed,
absent
from
the
trial,
you
don't
need
to
show
any
actual
harm
with
respect
to
any
individual
ruling.
now,
one
may
not
agree
with
the
legal
theory,
but
all
i
need
to
show
here
is
that
the
legal
theory
is
not
one
that
would
give
notice
of
the
actual
existence
of
a
brady
claim.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
yes,
justice
souter,
and
in
addition
there
is
an
additional
factor
that
bears
on
the
issue
that
was
raised
by
justice
scalia
here.
not
only
did
they
say
at
page
212
and
page
213
of
the
j.a....
that's
at
the
outset
of
volume
2...
that
from
the
outset
of
litigation,
i.e.,
from
the
trial,
we
have
been
in
compliance
with
brady
through
the
open
file
so
that
it
was
a
representation
that
they
had
always
been
in
compliance.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
that
is
actually
not
accurate,
justice
kennedy.
if
you
look
at
page--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--once--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--once
the
state
had
made
a
judgment
that
they
were
not
covered
by
brady,
we
could
not
go
into
a
court
because
it
would
be
deemed
privileged.
if
you
look
at
page
368
of
the
j.a.,
when
counsel
for
the
state,
who
was
the
trial
lawyer
for
the
state,
was
asked,
how
did
you
comply
with
brady,
his
response
was,
my
open
file
contained
everything
that
was
discoverable
under
brady,
including
any
reports
that
were
discoverable
under
brady.
to...
in
fact--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--justice
kennedy,
given
that
this
court
held
in
the
amadeo
case
that
concealment
is
always
cause
if
it
is
established,
and
given
that
it
is
an
element
of
the
brady
claim
that
there
would
be
withholding
of
the
evidence,
it
would
ordinarily
be
the
case
that
if
you
have
a
brady
claim
in
which
you
are
able
to
make
out
the
elements
of
the
claim,
you
would
almost
be
there
on
the
issue
of
cause.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
concealment
suggests,
indeed,
something
affirmative,
and--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--well,
it
is
a
failure
to
disclose
and
at
least
coupled
with
a
representation
that
everything
had
been
turned
over.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
yes,
we
do,
justice
o'connor.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
no,
but--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--justice
scalia,
that
is
not
so
for
two
reasons.
the
representation
that
we
got
at
the
trial
was
that
there
was
something
called
an
open
file,
and
the
open...
and
the
issue
then
is,
is
that
a
representation
that
that
is
how
they
are
complying
with
brady,
because
if
the
words
open
file
mean,
this
is
in
discharge
of
my
brady
duties,
the
representation
was
unquestionably
made
at
the
trial
level,
and
we--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--well,
justice
kennedy,
two
points.
i
do
have
the
amadeo
case
for
the
proposition
that
concealment
by
the
state
is
actually
a
showing
of
cause,
and
the
other
point
that
i
think
is
significant
for
further
purposes,
for
these
purposes
is
that
this
is
the
type
of
evidence
that
is
uniquely
in
the
possession
of
law
enforcement.
these
are
not
matters
that
might
conceivably
be
in
the
public
record,
and
that
the
lawyer
for
the
government
somehow
also
has.
these
are
matters
that
are
the
by
products
of
the
investigation
itself,
so
if
we're
talking
about
a
class
of
evidence
as
to
which
the
rule
that
i'm
urging
and
that
i
think
is
warranted
by
the
amadeo
case
makes
perfect
sense,
it
is
in
this
very
context.
to
get
back
to
the
point
that
i
was
just
about
to
make
to
justice
scalia,
the
state
did
represent
at
trial
that
there
was
an
open
file,
and
it
seems
clear
from
the
record
that
we
have
now...
that
the
words
open
file
were
an
affirmative
representation
that
this
was
in
compliance
with
brady
for
at
least
two
reasons.
number
1,
at
page
368
of
the
joint
appendix,
when
the
trial
lawyer
for
the
state
was
asked,
in
federal
habeas,
when
his
interests
to
say
that
it
meant
something
else
would
have
been
strongest,
he
said,
i
comply
with
brady
through
my
open
file.
that's
what
i
was
giving
the
other
side.
it
was
brady
that
was
the
open
file.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
justice
scalia,
i
think
it
is
not
quite
the
same
thing,
because
failure
to
disclose
the
exculpatory
evidence
under
the
brady
case
law
without
a
request
and
without
a
representation
of
any
sort,
implied
or
expressed,
is
a
completed
brady
violation
if
the
materials
are
exculpatory
and
material,
if
they're
important
enough.
in
other
words,
there
need
not
be
a
representation
by
defense
counsel
or
by
the
prosecutor
for
a
brady
claim
to
arise,
so
i
am
saying
something
that
is
not
quite
what
you
adverted
to,
because
i
am
saying
that
here
we
could
have
a
brady
violation
that
flows
from
the
withholding
of
the
information
alone,
and
we
have
more.
we
have
the
prosecutor
in
effect
quelling
any
doubts
that
reasonable
defense
counsel
might
have
had
by
saying--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--two...
two
issues,
justice
ginsburg.
i
think
that
first,
for
all
intents
and
purposes,
we
did.
in
the
state
habeas,
when
the
state
moved
to
dismiss
the
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel
point,
they
did
so
on
the
legal
theory
that
was
earlier
outlined
by
the
chief
justice.
they
said
in
effect,
you
have
no
basis
for
thinking
that
any
of
these
failures
by
counsel
caused
you
actual
harm.
and
we
replied
by
saying,
you're
absolutely
correct,
we
do
not.
that's
why
we
want
an
investigator,
and
we
want
to
have
funds
so
that
we
may
investigate
further.
the
state
said,
once
you've
conceded
that
you
have
no
current
basis
for
thinking
that
any
of
these
rulings
caused
you
harm,
there
is
no
need
for
further
investigation.
there
is
no
need
for
anything
further
to
be
done.
your
case
should
be
dismissed.
it
seems
to
me
that
once
the
state
came
back
and
said
that
we
had
no
actual
basis
for
the
assertion
of
any
harm
from
any
of
the
many
items
that
added
up
to
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel,
and
we
asked
for
the
court's
help
so
that
we
could
investigate
it
further
and
were
successfully
opposed
by
the
state,
it
would
have
been...
it
is
really
the
functional
equivalent
of
asking
for
the
information.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
no.
the
principle
is
that--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--well--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--well,
that's...
but
this
is
highly
germane
to
the
questions
that
justice
ginsburg
asked,
because
that
was
exactly
the
motion
if...
if
one
was
made
in
federal
court.
if
you
look
at
the
order
that
issued
from
federal
court,
and
by
the
way,
we
have
been
working
on
the
assumption
that
it
was
a
result
of
a
motion,
though
i
can't
find
any
such
motion
in
the
record.
the
order
is,
you
may
take
this
order,
new
counsel,
and
go
to
anyone
who
conceivably
may
have
a
document
with
your
client's
name
on
it
and
see
if
you
can
get
it.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
yes.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
and
as
it
happens
the
fourth
circuit
since
then
has
ruled
that
this
sort
of
ex
parte
discovery
may
not
be
conducted,
so
this
is
something
that
could
not
arise
in
the
fourth
circuit
in
the
present
day.
that
is
why
i
said
at
the
outset
that
it
is
important
to
note
that
the
documents
came
up
as...
by
sheer
happenstance.
this
is
exactly
like
the
amadeo
case.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
one
of
their
claims.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
and
they
have
several
variants
of
that.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
mm
hmm,
and
we
did
not
have
those
statements.
the
trial
lawyer--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--it
is
conceded
for
present
purposes
in
this
court,
and
because
of
the
posture
of
the
case
at
summary
judgment,
that
we
will
assume
we
had
three
of
them.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
and
you
take
the
case
on
that
assumption,
at
least
for
ruling--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--i...
their
claim
is
based
on
a
one
paragraph
affidavit
by
one
of
the
counsel
for
mr.
strickler,
mr.
roberts,
who
asserts
in
fact
that
he
does
not
recall
ever
seeing
any
of
these
documents,
but
that
he
does
recall
some
unspecified
information
that
is
reflected
in
them
that
led
him
to
think
that
her
story
had
gotten
better
over
time.
the
district
court
was
faced
with
that
affidavit
and
concluded
that
weighed
against
the
affidavit
from
the
very
same
trial
prosecutor
that
he
could
not
recall
ever
seeing
any
of
these
five
documents,
it
was
insufficient
to
give
rise
to
an
issue
of
fact
on
whether,
on
the
five
documents
that
the
case
is
here
on,
we
in
fact
ever
had
those
documents.
the
evidence
that
is
reflected
in
those
five
documents
is
qualitatively
and
quantitatively
different
from
what
we
may
have
had
from
other
sources
at
the
time
of
the
trial.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
justice
scalia,
there
are
two
answers
to
that.
you
know,
the
first
one
is
that
a
trial
lawyer
may
have
reason
to
think
that,
as
roberts
put
it,
this
is
too
good
to
be
true.
but
for
brady
purposes
there
is
a
vast
difference
between
saying
this
can't
be
right
and
being
able
to
take
the
documents
and
confront
the
witness
with
them.
and
unless
we
had
the--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--justice
scalia,
the
answer
to
that
is
no,
because
if
all
you
thought
was
that
she
had
had
interviews
with
the
detective,
or
she
had
met
with
the
prosecutor,
that
did
not
give
you
any
notice
that
she
had
made
inconsistent
statement,
much
less,
did
she
give
you
notice.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
that's
correct,
and
i
will
point
out
that
we
sent
an
investigator
to
talk
with
ms.
stoltzfus
in
advance
of
the
trial,
and
his
affidavit
is
in
the
record,
and
she
inquired
on
whose
behalf
he
was
there
for,
was
told
that
it
was
on
behalf
of
strickler,
and
she
said,
have
a
good
day,
goodbye.
so
it
is
not
as
though
we
did
nothing
in
the
trial
court
and
at
all
times,
whatever
doubts
we
had
we
had
to
weigh
against
the
representations
by
the
state
of
virginia--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--that
everything
was
all
right.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
that
is
correct,
justice
souter.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
uh
huh.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
that's
why
we
want
expert
assistance.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
that
is
right,
and
in
fact--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--they
were
worse
than
being
mute.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
by
that
time,
they
had
already
made
the
representation
in
the
motion
to
dismiss
that
is
at
page
212
and
213
of
the
joint
appendix,
which
is--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--you
know,
from
the
outset
of
the
trial
we
complied
with
brady
through
the
open
file.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
and
after
we
pointed
out
that
we
in
effect
did
not
have
a
basis
for
claiming
harm
from
the
various
items
that
we
claimed,
and
that
is
at
page
234
of
the
j.a.,
paragraphs
2
and
3,
the
state
did
better
than
standing
mute.
at
page
242
they
came
back,
and
this
is
paragraph
number
9.
they
say,
strickler,
and
i'm
quoting,
is
implicitly
conceding
that
he
is
not
aware
of
factual
support
for
the
claim
he
has
already
made.
respondent
agrees.
so
they
didn't--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--that
we
had
no
factual
support
for
the
claims
that
we
had
made,
for
the
claims
of
harm.
this
was
in
the
context
of
they're
moving
to
dismiss
our
state
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel
claim
on
the
theory
that
it
was
not
good
enough
to
plead
it
on
the
first
prong
of
strickland,
and
that
we
have
to
show
some
harm
from
each
of
the
individual
rulings.
in
response
to
that,
we
in
effect
conceded
that
we
were
not
on
notice
of
any
basis
on
which
we
could
think
that
we
were
harmed
by
any
one
of
the
rulings
and
asked
for
an
investigator.
the
reaction
by
the
state--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--uh
huh.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
let
me
take
the
last
question
first,
justice
ginsburg,
because
under
the
brady
doctrine
the
good
faith
and
the
bad
faith
of
the
prosecutor
is
irrelevant,
and
under
kyles,
they
had
an
affirmative
duty
to
seek
out
law
enforcement
agents
who
may
have
had
involvement
in
the
investigation
to
ensure
that
they
had
discharged
their
constitutional
duties,
so
it
is
not
as
though
the
fact
that
if
in
good
faith
they
did
not
have
the
documents
answers
the
question
of
whether
there
was
a
brady
violation.
to
take
your--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--well,
that
is
not,
in
fact,
our
theory,
justice
ginsburg.
our...
he
pleaded
not
guilty,
and
he
has
always
maintained
that
he
is
not
guilty
of
these
crimes.
our
theory
is
that
the
state
went
to
the
jury
on
the
basis
of
an
eye
witness
whose
testimony,
coming
from
somebody
who
has
no
apparent
stake
in
the
controversy,
must
have
weighed
heavily
with
the
jury,
and
they
played
on
that
jury
in
their
closing
and
in
the
sentencing,
and--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--that
is
right,
mr.
chief
justice,
but
this
was
a
general
verdict.
and
if
the
jury
chose
to
sentence
him
to
capital
murder
because
they
found
him
guilty
of
the
abduction,
we
don't
know,
and
it
is
no
answer
to
say,
as
the
state
does,
that
there
was
in
addition
something
else
wrong
with
the
abduction
predicate.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
we
have--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--well,
i
do
not
think
that
that
is
correct,
mr.
chief
justice,
because
i
think
you
are
implicitly
giving
way
to
the
testimony
of
donna
tudor,
who
a
jury
would
be
entitled
to
find
is
entitled
to
no
credence.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
that
is
not
a...
that
is
not
the
same
question
you
asked
earlier,
because
in
asking
the
question
you
just
asked,
i
must
assume
that
the
evidence
is
truthful.
if
it's
all
right
with
the
court,
i
would
like
to--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--the
prejudice,
as--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--we
were--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--we
were--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--the
prejudice
is
that
a
jury
of
12
citizens
can
sleep
very
soundly
at
night
thinking
that
they
sent
somebody
to
death
on
the
word
of
a
perfectly
reliable
witness.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
we
would
have--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--that
is
not
true,
justice
breyer,
because
there
were
in
effect
two
other
witnesses,
one
of
them
is
donna
tudor,
and
she
has
terribly
incriminating
things
to
say,
which,
for
the
reasons
i
pointed
out
in
the
brief,
should
be
discounted.
the
other
one
was
curt
massey,
who
all
he
could
say
was
that
he
saw
my
client
on
the
road,
it
was
night,
she
had
the
number
of
people
in
the
car
wrong,
and
the
race
of
the
people
in
the
car
wrong,
if
one
were
to
credit--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--that
is
not
true.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
because
under
kyles
the
prejudice
test,
which
is
the
same
as
the
bagley
materiality
test,
is
not
a
sufficiency
of
the
evidence
test.
that
is
my
first
point.
and
my
second
point
is
that
the
whole
harm
of
what
happened
here
is
that
the
evidence
that
the
state
put
forth,
which
was
one
and
a
half
hairs
that
could
have
come
from
any
white
person
and
two
witnesses
who
could
be
heavily
impeached
but
were
not--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--the
prejudice
comes
from--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--the
fact
that
once
the
jury
heard
that
he
was
at
point
1
in
the
state's
time
line,
it
could
not
but
find
that
he
was
everywhere
else.
