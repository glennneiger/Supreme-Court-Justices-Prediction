unknown
speaker
your
second
point
would
cover
both
default
and
prejudice,
then,
i
take
it.
unknown
speaker
i'm
not
sure
what
you
mean
by
your
second
point.
you
mean
if
there's
a
brady
violation,
that's
the
end
of
it,
you
don't
have
to
show
cause
and
prejudice?
unknown
speaker
of
cause,
well,
let
me
ask
you
about
cause
here.
how
was
this
brady
violation
discovered,
and
why
could
it
not
have
been
discovered
prior
to
the
filing
of
the
state
habeas
petition?
unknown
speaker
couldn't
that
have
been
obtained
before
the
filing
of
the
state
habeas?
unknown
speaker
the
same
thing?
unknown
speaker
wasn't
one
of
the
claims
in
the
state
habeas
precisely
a
brady
violation?
wasn't
that
one
of
them?
unknown
speaker
with
respect,
i'm
asking
a
question.
i--
unknown
speaker
--wasn't
it
part
of
the
inadequate
assistance
of
counsel
claim
that
was
made
at
one
time
in
state
habeas?
they
said
one
of
the
reasons
for
inadequate
assistance
of
counsel
was,
he
didn't
make
a
brady
motion,
so
isn't
the
brady...
the
allegation
that
there
was
no
brady
motion
subsumed
in
the
inadequate
assistance
of
counsel?
unknown
speaker
and
one
of
those
things
you
say
was
that
he
did
not
pursue
a
brady
violation.
unknown
speaker
so
he
was
on
notice
at
that
point
that
the
brady
violation
issue
should
have
been
pursued,
and
yet
he
did
not
pursue
it.
unknown
speaker
okay,
but
if
he
had
failed--
--but
that's
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel,
certainly
it
must
be
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel
because
the
brady
violation
at
least
theoretically
would
have
turned
up
something.
unknown
speaker
but
in
any
case,
i
think
it's
also
your
argument
that,
even
assuming
that
they
would
sensibly
have
thought
at
least
of
a
brady
claim,
there
would
still
have
been
cause
here,
because,
consistently
throughout
the
litigation,
the
commonwealth
of
virginia
had
taken
the
position
that
in
fact
they
had
an
open
file
and
therefore
that,
after
all,
would
be
cause
not
to
pursue
the
claim
any
further
than
you
went.
unknown
speaker
well,
leaving
brady
aside,
and
correct
me
if
i'm
wrong,
leaving
brady
aside,
my
understanding
is
that
virginia
does
not
have
in
its
open
file
or
in
its
prosecutor's
file
investigative
reports
such
as
claytor's,
correct?
unknown
speaker
well,
but
i
had
thought
part
of
your
submission
was
that
you
couldn't
get
these
reports
under
virginia
rule
because
they're
investigative
reports
that
are
not
disclosable.
unknown
speaker
absent
brady.
unknown
speaker
well,
but
then
you're
making
brady
more
or
less
self
executing.
if
you
don't
produce
under
brady,
it's
automatically
cause.
unknown
speaker
concealment
suggests
something
affirmative
though,
does
it
not?
unknown
speaker
not
just
a
failure
to
disclose,
but
an
effort
to
actually
hide.
unknown
speaker
and
i
take
it
that's--
--and
you
do...
you
do
assert
here
that
there
was
a
representation
by
counsel
for
the
state,
both
at
the
trial
level
and
then
again
by
the
attorney
general
on
post
conviction.
unknown
speaker
you
do
not
at
the
trial.
you
do
not
at
the
trial
level
assert
that
he
said
there
were...
you
had
the
open
files,
and
everything
relevant
was
in
the
open
files.
unknown
speaker
you...
that
statement
is
only
made
in
the
middle
of
the
state
habeas
proceeding
and
therefore
cannot
explain
your
failure
to
do
anything
at
the
commencement
of
the
state
habeas
proceedings.
you
were
deceived
after
you
had
already
been
in
default
of
your
obligation.
unknown
speaker
but
prosecutors
always
say
they
comply
with
brady.
and
you're
in
effect
saying,
once
there's
a
representation
we've
complied
with
brady,
you
have
no
independent
obligation
to
pursue
a
brady
violation,
and
i
just
don't
think
you
have
any
law
for
that
play.
unknown
speaker
that
says
nothing
more
than
what
justice
kennedy
says.
there's
always
an
implicit
representation,
and
sometimes
an
explicit
representation
by
the
prosecution
that
it
has
turned
over
the
files
that
the
law
requires
it
to
turn
over.
that's
always
an
implicit...
every
brady
violation
constitutes
that,
and
therefore
you're
in
effect
saying
you
don't
have
to
show
cause
as
well
as
not
having
to
show
prejudice
once
there's
a
brady
violation.
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
you
something
about
a
procedural
course,
even
before
you
get
into
all
of
this?
i
understand
there's
a
notion
of
exhaustion.
that's
why
we
require
you
go
through
the
state
habeas,
first.
nothing
more
was
known
at
the
federal
level
than
was
known
at
the
state
level.
the
motion
for
discovery,
for
sweeping
discovery
that
was
made
successfully
in
the
federal
court,
was
not
made
in
the
state
court.
so
a
remedy
that
was
availed
of
in
the
federal
court
was
not
even
sought.
now,
if
they
had
asked
and
the
state
said
no,
you
can't
discover,
and
then
you
came
to
federal
court
and
asked
for
the
same
thing,
that
would
be
one
thing,
but
what
excuses
the
failure
to
make
in
the
state
court
the
procedural
move
that
you
made
in
the
federal
court?
unknown
speaker
whenever
you
ask
for
the
court's
help,
you
implicitly
ask
for
whatever
you
should
have
asked
for,
is
that
the
principle
you
want
us
to
accept?
unknown
speaker
you
should
have
asked
for
these...
for
the
documents
that
related
to
your
client
that
were
the
documents
of
the
investigation.
and
i
don't
see
how
a
general
throwing
yourself
upon
the
assistance
of
the
court
complies
with
that.
the
court
has
some
basis
to
know
more
precisely
what
it
is
you're
seeking
from
the
state.
unknown
speaker
not
just
say,
give
us
help
for
whatever
we
need.
unknown
speaker
and
it
had
nothing
to
do
with
brady
or
not
specifically
to
do
with...
it
was
just
a
total,
sweeping,
discover
anything
about
this
case--
unknown
speaker
--psychiatric
evidence--
unknown
speaker
--mr.
estrada,
the
state
seems
to
suggest
that
the
petitioner's
lawyers
knew
of
the
witness
stoltzfus'
materials
at
the
time
of
the
trial.
how
do
you
respond
to
that?
i
understand
that
to
be--
unknown
speaker
--one
of
their
claims.
unknown
speaker
what
we're
really
talking
about
here
are
a
series
of
statements
made
over
a
period
of
time
by
the
witness
stoltzfus,
right?
unknown
speaker
you
had
some
of
them,
three
of
them?
unknown
speaker
and
we
take
the
case
on
that
assumption.
unknown
speaker
and
so
how
do
you
respond
to
their
assertion
that
you
had
them
all?
unknown
speaker
but
that
isn't
the
point,
whether
you
had
the
other
five
documents.
yeah,
they
said
you
didn't
have
the
other
five
documents,
but
the
point
is
whether
you
had
reason
to
believe
during
the
trial
that
in
fact
this
witness's
testimony
had
been
considerably
elaborated
over
the
course
of
her
interviews
with
the
prosecution
and
with
the
boyfriend
of
the
deceased.
unknown
speaker
true,
but
that
isn't
the
issue,
whether
he
could
have
confronted
the
witness.
the
issue
is
whether
he
should
have
at
that
point
pursued
a
brady
claim.
unknown
speaker
in
other
words,
you
have
three
documents
that
you're
conceding
for
the
sake
of
argument
here
would
have
put
you
on
notice,
in
effect,
of
just
what
you
would
have
suspected
at
the
trial,
and
that
is
should
she
talked
with
the--
unknown
speaker
--well,
i--
unknown
speaker
--well,
may
i
take
you
back
to
one
other
representation,
because
we
were
on
the
state
habeas,
and
then
we
got
off
it,
and
there's
just
one
thing
i
want
to
make
sure
i'm
clear
on.
in
the
state
habeas
the
ineffective
assistance
claim,
or
one
ineffective
assistance
claim
referred
to
the
failure
to
file
a
brady
motion.
unknown
speaker
you
were
asked...
i
don't
remember
whether
it
was
by
the
court
or
put
on
as,
it
were,
on
the
spot
by
the
state
in
saying,
do
you
have
any
specific
reason
to
believe,
or
any
evidence
that
you
were
in
fact
prejudiced.
unknown
speaker
and
your
response
to
the
court
was,
no,
that's
why
we
want
discovery.
unknown
speaker
okay,
expert
assistance.
i
take
it
at
that
point
that
the
state
in
effect
was
mute
in
the
sense
that
the
state
obviously
did
not
say
at
that
point,
well,
you
know,
there
may
be
some
material
that's
exculpatory
that
we
haven't
provided.
unknown
speaker
do
you--
unknown
speaker
--what
did
they
say?
unknown
speaker
the
open
file
representation?
unknown
speaker
okay.
unknown
speaker
respondent
agrees
with
what,
that
strickler
concedes
something?
unknown
speaker
well,
can
we
get
down
to
the
harm?
i
mean,
you
said
it
was
no
question
that
this
woman
had
been
several
times
interviewed
by
claytor.
that
was
clear
when
she
was
on
the
stand.
that
was
tipped
off
in
the
three
letters
that
we
assume...
documents
that
you
had.
so
that
was
known,
that
she
had
several
times
met
with
the
state's
investigator.
it
was
also
known
in
one
of
those
letters
that
she
said
my
memory
is
sometimes
muddled,
one
of
the
letters
that
we
assume--
unknown
speaker
--and
as
i
understand
it,
although
you've
used
the
word
concealment,
there's
no
suggestion
here
that
it
was
anything
but
some
kind
of
negligence
involved
that
these
weren't
turned
over.
unknown
speaker
i
didn't
think
that,
but
i'd
really
like
you
to
concentrate
on
the
prejudice
for
this
reason.
kyles
was
a
case
where
the
argument
was
that
the
brady
materials
really
made
a
case
for
actual
innocence.
here,
as
i
understand,
it's
not...
that's
not
the
claim.
you
are
not
claiming,
or
are
you,
that
strickler
would
be
a
nonparticipant?
i
thought
that
the
only
thing
that
you
thought
you
could
do
with
this
is
to
say,
the
chief
man
was
henderson
and
not
strickler.
unknown
speaker
but
they
went
on
abduction
as
well
as
armed
robbery,
did
they
not?
unknown
speaker
but
clearly
you're
not
contending
your
client
was
not
implicated
in
this
killing.
unknown
speaker
you
would
be
on
very
shaky
ground,
i
would
think,
in
view
of
the
evidence,
if
you
did.
unknown
speaker
well,
if
stoltzfus
had
not
testified,
are
you
saying
there
wouldn't
have
been
enough
evidence
to
go
to
the
jury?
unknown
speaker
i
have
one
question,
just
on
this
line.
the
one
question
i
have
is,
i'd
like
you
to
state
precisely
what
the
prejudice
in
your
opinion
is,
assuming
that
you're
right
on
every
other
matter.
unknown
speaker
you
have
to
show
cause
and
prejudice.
unknown
speaker
it's
the
same
question
you
began
to
answer
to
the
chief.
unknown
speaker
and
i'd
like
to
know
precisely
what,
in
your
opinion,
does
the
prejudice...
because
the
circuit
said
there
is
no
prejudice.
there
was
loads
of
other
evidence,
and
i
agree
that
donna
tudor
is
a
little
shaky.
that's
one
point
in
your
favor,
but
what
precisely
is
the
prejudice?
unknown
speaker
no,
look,
she...
i
want
to
be
more
precise
than
that.
i
take
it
mrs.
stoltzfus,
assuming
she
didn't
know
what
she
was
talking
about
and
hadn't
even
appeared,
what
would
have
happened
is
you
wouldn't
have
established
that
your
client
kidnapped
this
woman.
unknown
speaker
fine.
you
wouldn't
have
established
what
happened
at
the
parking...
with
the
car
at
the
beginning,
in
the
shopping
mall.
but
this
murder
didn't
take
place
then,
it
took
place
much
later,
there
were
other
witnesses,
et
cetera,
and
so
that's
what
i
want
you
to
address.
unknown
speaker
so
what
i
should
do
to
satisfy
myself
is
read
through
the
record,
and
if
i
think
there
is
sufficient
evidence,
leaving
ms.
stoltzfus
aside,
and
discounting
ms.
tudor,
if
i
think
nonetheless
there
is
sufficient
evidence
so
i
have
no
doubt,
or
virtually
no
doubt
that
your
client
was
at
the
place
where
this
woman
was
killed,
and
participated
in
a
kidnapping,
i
should
then
reject
your
argument?
unknown
speaker
okay.
good.
why
not?
unknown
speaker
you
left
out
virginia
smith.
what
i'm
trying
to
drive
at
is,
is
it
that
you're
saying
the
prejudice
comes
from
your
client
being
there,
or
is
it
that
you're
saying
it's
from
what
he
did
there?
unknown
speaker
or
both.
unknown
speaker
thank
you,
mr.
estrada.
ms.
rumpz,
we'll
hear
from
you.
unknown
speaker
well
now,
if
we
accept
the
argument
that
the
state
represented
all
along
that
everything
that
complied
with
brady
was
in
the
open
file,
then
does
it
matter
that
he
didn't
seek
discovery?
unknown
speaker
no,
representation
that
everything
complying
with
brady
was
in
the
open
file.
unknown
speaker
but
it
seems
to
me--
--in
your
view,
at
that
time
was
there
grounds
for
a
brady
motion?
unknown
speaker
no,
when
he
filed
the
state
collateral...
the
habeas
in
the
state
collateral
proceeding.
unknown
speaker
what
was
the
ground
for
the
brady
motion
at
that
time?
unknown
speaker
well,
to...
to
succeed
on
the
brady,
on
a
motion
to
have
brady
discovery
in
the
state
collateral
proceeding,
do
you
not
have
to
show
some
reason
to
believe
that
brady
material
was
withheld?
unknown
speaker
or
am
i
wrong
about
that?
unknown
speaker
no,
but
as
i
under--
--but
i
need
to
know
what
was
the
good
cause?
that's
all
i
need
to...
what
was
the
cause
for
a...
to
grant
a
brady
motion
at
the
state
collateral
proceeding?
unknown
speaker
well,
but
don't
you
have
to
show
that
there's
cause
for
a
brady
viol...
don't
you
have
to
show
that
there's
reason
to
know
that
she
might
have
changed
her
story?
unknown
speaker
but
may
i
just
ask
on
that
point,
at
the...
in
your
motion
to
dismiss
at
the
commencement
of
the
state
collateral
proceeding,
you
represented,
or
the
state
did,
given
that
counsel
were
voluntarily
given
full
disclosure
of
everything
known
to
the
government,
there
was
no
need
for
a
formal
motion.
so
your
position
many
months
later
was
that
everything
you
knew
had
been
turned
over;
is
that
right?
unknown
speaker
so
that
was
the
position
of
the
state
of
virginia
at
that
time.
unknown
speaker
well,
you
said
known
to
the
government.
doesn't
that
mean
any
agency
of
the
government
for
purposes
of
brady?
i
mean,
brady...
it's
very
clear
at
this
point
that
the
brady
obligation
does
not
depend
on
the
prosecutor's
particular
knowledge
of
an
item
of
evidence.
if
anyone
representing
the
government
in
that
investigation
had
the
evidence,
the
government
has
an
obligation
to
turn
it
over.
so
that
when
you
make
a...
or
when
someone
made
a
statement
that
everything
known
to
the
government
had
been
disclosed,
and
it's
in
connection
with,
among
other
things,
a
brady
issue
that
arises
because
of
the
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel
motion,
isn't
the
only
natural
reading
of
that
response
to
be,
yes,
for
brady
purposes
everything
known
to
the
government
has
been
disclosed?
isn't
that
the
fair
reading?
unknown
speaker
well,
it
may
not
have
been
intended
by
the
warden,
but
isn't
that
a
proper
basis
upon
which
defense
counsel
could
have
understood
it
and,
if
so,
why
in
the
world
is
that
not
adequate
cause
for
going
no
further?
unknown
speaker
well,
it
raised
a
claim
of
ineffective
assistance
predicated
upon
the
failure
to
make
a
brady
motion.
the
only
way
that
claim
of
ineffective
assistance
could
have
succeeded
would
ultimately
have
been
with
a
showing
of
prejudice.
assuming
you
get
over
the
prong
of
reasonable
competence,
you
then
have
to
show
prejudice.
in
order
to
show
prejudice
you
at
least
would
have
to
have
shown
brady
prejudice,
and
therefore
the...
it
seems
to
me
the
filing
of
that
motion
raised
the
entire
brady
issue
right
then
and
there.
and
the
response
of
the
state
was,
there's
no
reason
to
go
into
this
court
because
the
state,
the
government
has
turned
over
all
the
evidence
that
it's
gotten.
unknown
speaker
all
right,
then
let
me
ask
you
this.
unknown
speaker
let
me
ask
you
this.
let's
assume
that
motion
had
been
pursued.
and
let's
assume
that
the...
that
counsel
for
the
petitioner
here
had
demonstrated
to
everyone's
satisfaction,
including
the
court's,
and
the
court
had
said
so,
that
in
fact
the
lawyer's
failure
to
file
a
brady
motion
during
trial,
or
at
the
trial
stage,
had
in
fact
been
an
inadequacy.
it
had
been
a
failure
of
reasonable
representation.
would
the
state
at
that
point
then
have
said,
okay,
we
concede
that
there
should
be
a
new
trial
for
failure
of
assistance
of
counsel?
unknown
speaker
my
question
is,
would
you
have
conceded
error.
and
i
think
the
answer
is,
of
course
you
wouldn't
have
conceded
error.
unknown
speaker
you
would
have
said,
look,
they've
only
gone
half
way
on
the
ineffective
assistance
point.
they've
got
to
prove
prejudice,
and
in
order
to
prove
prejudice
they
would
have
to
have
shown
that
if
the
brady
motion
had
been
filed
there
would
have
been
material
forthcoming.
and
if
that
material
had
been
forthcoming,
there
is
a
reasonable
probability
within
the
meaning
of
that
term
in
brady
that
the
result
would
have
been
different.
you
would
have
required
them
to
show
prejudice.
and
the
reason
i
make
this
argument
is
that
you're
saying,
oh
well,
that's...
filing
an
inassistance
motion
is
not
like
filing
a
brady
motion.
and
my
point
is,
of
course
it's
like
filing
a
brady
motion,
because
you
would
not
have
conceded
that
they
were
able
to
succeed
on
the
ineffective
assistance
unless
they
had
proved
what
in
effect
would
have
been
a
brady
violation.
unknown
speaker
well,
sure.
ms.
rumpz--
unknown
speaker
--i
notice
that
the
opinion
of
the
supreme
court
of
virginia
in
the
state
habeas
proceeding
came
down
in
january
1995,
which
i
think
was
somewhat
before
our
decision
in
the
kyles
case.
when
were
the...
do
you
know
when
the
actual
proceedings
in
the
augusta
county
trial
court
were
conducted
in
that
case?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
thank
you.
what
is...
may
i
just
finish
up,
because
my
reason
for
calling
your
attention
to
the
statement
in
the...
your
motion
to
dismiss
was
not
as
profound
as
what
you've
discussed
with
justice
souter.
it
was
to
ask
you
whether,
given
the
fact
that
the
state
at
that
time,
which
presumably
would
have
read
the
newspapers
at
the
time
of
trial
and
all
the
rest,
was
still
able
to
say
they
thought
everything
had
been
turned
over
to
the
defendant.
why
is
it
that
you
can
say
the
defendant
should
have
read
the
newspapers
and
figured
out
otherwise
a
long
time
earlier?
do
you
understand
my
question?
unknown
speaker
you
earlier
said
to
me,
well,
they
were
on
notice
that
there
was...
might
well
have
been
a
brady
claim
because
the
newspaper
stories
indicated
that
this
wouldn't
have...
may
not
have
been
reliable,
a
lot
of
other
stuff.
but
then
2
years
later
you're
saying
the
state
is
still
taking
the
position
that
everything
relevant
had
already
been
turned
over,
so
it
seems
to
me
you
can't
have
it
both
ways.
unknown
speaker
maybe
the
state
was
lying.
you
don't
have
to
take
the
position
that
the
state
wasn't
lying,
do
you?
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
i
mean,
i
know
you'd
like
to,
but
is
that
essential
to
your
case?
let's
assume
it
was
a
misrepresentation
by
the
state.
would
that
make
any
difference?
unknown
speaker
but
is
said--
--it
said,
counsel,
we're
voluntarily
giving
full
disclosure
of
everything
known
to
the
government,
which
suggests
that
they
knew
about
the
police
files...
which
suggests
that
they
didn't
know
about
the
police
files.
i
think
that's
your
view.
let
me
ask
you
this,
did
the
lawyers
at
this
time
know
about
the
police
files?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
and
don't
you
also
think,
no,
that
the
prosecutor
didn't
know
at
the
time
of
trial?
unknown
speaker
and
do
you
also
agree
that
if
he
had
known
of
them,
he
would
have
had
a
duty
to
turn
them
over?
unknown
speaker
you
don't
agree
with
that?
unknown
speaker
what
about
brady?
unknown
speaker
this
is
dynamite
impeachment
material.
let's
just
assume
that.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
think
it
is.
but
in
all
events,
one
of
the
things
that
puzzles
me
in
this
case,
and
i
don't
know
which
way
it
cuts,
is
it
seems
to
me
that
any
attorney,
trial,
habeas,
prosecutor,
defense,
ought
to
know
that
there's
witness
notes
taken
by
the
officer,
and
nobody
seems
to
ask
for
them,
and
i'm
baffled
by
that.
unknown
speaker
that's
my
next
point.
as
trial
counsel
it's
not
completely
clear,
assuming
they're
not
brady
material,
that
he
could
get
these
notes
anyway,
is
it?
he'd
have
to
call
claytor
to
the
stand,
he,
the
defense
counsel,
and
ask
claytor,
did
you
take
any
notes?
unknown
speaker
that's
about
the
only
way
you
could
do
it,
i
suppose.
unknown
speaker
under
virginia
law,
once
she
says
she
talked
to
detective
claytor,
can
the
defense
counsel
say
to
the
prosecution,
i'd
like
claytor's
notes,
please,
and
be
assured
that
he'll
get
them?
unknown
speaker
pardon
me?
unknown
speaker
that's
what
i
thought.
is--
--ms.
rumpz,
are
you
going
to
get
to
the
prejudice
half
of
the
case?
unknown
speaker
thank
you.
unknown
speaker
that
isn't
the
argument
given
by
the
fourth
circuit.
the
fourth
circuit
says,
let's
assume
that
stoltzfus
never
testified.
there
was
no
prejudice,
because
even
if
she
hadn't
testified,
strickler
never
contested
that
he
abducted
and
robbed
whitlock.
in
fact,
counsel
for
strickler
argued
to
the
jury
during
the
guilt
phase
they
should
convict
strickler
of
first
degree
murder
rather
than
capital
murder
because
henderson
rather
than
strickler
actually
killed
whitlock.
thus,
stoltzfus'
testimony
was
not
critical
to
the
commonwealth's
case,
especially
in
view
of
the
overwhelming
evidence
in
the
record
independent
of
stoltzfus'
testimony.
that's
the
fourth
circuit's
argument.
unknown
speaker
no,
no,
but
i
want
to
know
what
you
think
of
that
argument,
because
when
i
read
this
sentence,
in
fact,
counsel
for
strickler
argued
to
the
jury
during
the
guilt
phase
that
they
should
convict
strickler
of
first
degree
murder
rather
than
capital
murder
because
henderson
rather
than
strickler
actually
killed
whitlock.
when
i
focused
on
that
i
wondered,
i'm
not
sure
about
stoltzfus'
testimony.
maybe
it
is
critical,
because
maybe
it
was
stoltzfus
who
said
that
because
strickler
was
the
gang
leader,
that
put
the
idea
in
the
jury's
mind
that
indeed
strickler
was
the
one
who
threw
the
rock,
or
helped
throw
the
rock,
or
directed
the
throwing
of
the
rock,
and
without
that
testimony
the
jury
would
have
thought
no
such
thing.
now,
why
isn't
that
prejudice?
unknown
speaker
no,
i'm
not
talking
about
that.
it
certainly
matters
whether
the
jury
thought
strickler
was
somewhere
on
the
edge
of
the
area
in
a
car
looking
the
other
way,
or
whether
strickler
participated
in
the
throwing
of
the
rock
and
killing
the
victim.
that's--
--at
least
for
purposes
of
the
sentence
it
matters.
yes,
that's
what
i'm
talking
about,
just
for
purposes
of
the
sentence.
so
i
would
think
it
would
matter
a
lot
whether
the
jury
did
or
did
not
think
that
strickler
was
involved
and
participated
in
the
actual
killing.
unknown
speaker
doesn't
it?
does
that
not
matter
whether
he
participated
or
not?
you're
free
to
please
disagree
with
me
if
you
do.
i
mean--
unknown
speaker
--don't...
yes.
unknown
speaker
no,
no,
but
suppose
strickler
was
in
the
car
looking
the
other
way.
would
that
make
a
difference
under
virginia
law?
unknown
speaker
all
right.
unknown
speaker
no.
what
stoltzfus'
testimony
establishes
is
that
strickler
was
the
leader
of
the
group,
and
that
makes
it
more
likely
that
strickler
would
have
participated
in
the
killing
itself,
rather
than
been
looking
the
other
way.
that's
the
chain
of
reasoning.
unknown
speaker
now,
i
want
you
to
address
that
chain
of
reasoning.
unknown
speaker
you
can
pick
it
apart,
or
say
it's
irrelevant,
whatever
you
like.
unknown
speaker
required
two
people.
unknown
speaker
somebody
else
to
hold
the
victim.
unknown
speaker
why
is
that?
i
never
did
follow...
if
she
had
just
been
raped
and
brutally
attacked,
isn't
it
possible
that
she
was
immobile
at
that
time?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
think
your
response
that
you
gave
to
justice
breyer
is
rational
and
responsive,
but
it's
very
thin
evidence.
and
if
you
couple
it
with
stoltzfus'
testimony
that
what...
a
mountain
guy
or
mountain
man,
who
was
strickler,
was
really
the
agitator,
the
prime
actor
the
whole
time
she
observed
them
at
the
shopping
center,
and
this
was
the
prosecution's
case,
it
would
seem
to
me
fairly
clear
that
he
was
the
one
that
killed
her.
and
without
that
testimony
you
have
something...
a
very,
very
different
case.
unknown
speaker
were
they
discounted
as
being
just
microscopically
also
similar
to
henderson's?
was
there
any
test
of
henderson's
hair
so
we
could
know?
i
mean--
unknown
speaker
--this...
this--
unknown
speaker
--you
said
that
there
was
overwhelming
evidence,
apart
from
stoltzfus'
testimony,
that
strickler
was
the
one,
the
prime
mover
in
the
abduction
and
the
robbery
of
whitlock.
so
i
notice
there
was
one
witness
that
mr.
estrada
didn't
mention,
and
that
was
virginia
smith.
tell
us
what
is
your
strongest
case
for
saying
there
was
overwhelming
evidence
without
this
witness.
unknown
speaker
who
were
those
two
people?
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
i
don't
think
the
argument
is
the
implication
of
strickler
in
the
murder.
i
think
the
question
that
arises,
at
least
it's
my
question
that
arises
on
the
prejudice
issue,
is
this.
stoltzfus'
testimony
was
not
only,
as
has
been
pointed
out,
that
strickler
seemed
to
be
the
lead
person
in
this
group,
but
the
testimony
also
was
that
strickler
was
slightly
crazy.
and
when
we
get
to
the
point
of
trying
to
assess
the
probability
that
strickler
and
not
henderson
was
the
person
who
smashed
the
skull
with
the
rock,
the
fact
that
the
person
is
agitated
to
the
point
of
being
strange
and
weird
and
crazy
is
certainly
evidence
which
i
think
the
jury
would
have
considered
in
saying,
yes,
the
probability
is
that
he
was
the
one
who
used
the
rock
and
for
that
reason
our
discretionary
decision
at
the
sentencing
phase
is
going
to
be
to
recommend
death.
without
her
testimony
it
seems
to
me
the
state's
case,
as
it
were,
for
that
train
of
reasoning
would
have
been
weaker--
unknown
speaker
--and
for
that
reason
it
seems
to
me
that
there
may
be
materiality
as
to
the
discretionary
sentencing
decision.
unknown
speaker
well,
regardless
of
what
he's
claimed,
the
question
is
whether
the
jury
would
have
come
to
the
same
discretionary
decision
if,
as...
and
let's
say
on
the
reasoning
of
the
fourth
circuit,
if
her
testimony
had
been
excluded,
was
subject
to
very
substantial
impeachment
on
cross
examination.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
the
answer
is
quite
possibly
not.
and
that,
it
seems
to
me,
is
the
strongest
argument
for
materiality
here,
and
i
want
to
know
what
your
response
is
to
that.
unknown
speaker
oh,
and
that
goes
to
their
guilt?
that
goes
to
their
eligibility,
i
presume
under
virginia
law--
unknown
speaker
--for
the
death
penalty.
but
my
question
is
directed
to
the
jury's
ultimately
discretionary
decision.
the
jury
says,
okay,
we
understand
that
each
one
of
them
is
subject
to
the
death
penalty.
we
understand
the
joint
triggerman
rule.
our
question
is...
will,
either,
i
guess,
if
they
weren't
joint
trials,
our
question
is,
will
strickler
get
the
death
penalty.
and
the
suggestion
is
that
this
woman's
testimony
in
showing
him
as
the
leader
and
a
bit
of
a
nut
is
testimony
that
would
have
probably
had
an
influence
on
the
jury,
without
which
the
jury
might
well
have
come
to
a
different
discretionary
decision.
unknown
speaker
but
the
jury
might
have
said,
this
witness
is
unreliable.
unknown
speaker
mightn't
it?
unknown
speaker
that's
death
eligibility,
and
that's
conceded.
there's
no
question
about
that.
unknown
speaker
why
didn't
henderson
get
the
death
penalty?
unknown
speaker
what
was
the
instruction?
unknown
speaker
so
they
could
have
found
him
ineligible--
unknown
speaker
--under
the
henderson
instruction.
unknown
speaker
wasn't
there
other
direct
evidence
of...
that
he
was
the
one
that
dropped
the
rock?
unknown
speaker
what
other
than
tudor?
what
was
the
evidence
other
than
tudor?
unknown
speaker
anything
else?
just
tudor.
unknown
speaker
is
there
any
reason
why
tudor
would
have
wanted
to
put
it
on
him
rather
than
on
henderson?
unknown
speaker
strickler
was
her
boyfriend
as
opposed
to
henderson--
unknown
speaker
--did
she
testify
at
the
henderson
trial,
too,
and
was
the
prosecution's
theory
there
that
henderson
was
the
second
man?
unknown
speaker
was
she
ever
indicted
for
anything?
unknown
speaker
was
she
ever
indicted
for
anything?
unknown
speaker
of
course,
she
had
all
the
jewelry
from
the
victim
and
all
and
so
forth,
didn't
she?
unknown
speaker
but
henderson
had
the
watch,
as
i
recall,
and--
unknown
speaker
--henderson
gave
the
watch
to
his
girlfriend.
unknown
speaker
that's
a
wash.
unknown
speaker
none
of
that
goes
to
the
sentencing
factor,
however.
unknown
speaker
no,
because
she
was
an
extremely
credible
witness.
everybody
thought
she
was
telling
the
truth.
unknown
speaker
yes,
in
order
to
prove
his
innocence
he
would
have
had
to
do
that,
but
in
order
to
disprove
the
notion
that
he
was
the
ringleader
and
all,
he
wouldn't
have
had
to
do
that.
unknown
speaker
but
you
have
to
acknowledge
that
she
was
not
as
credible
a
witness
as
stoltzfus
was.
unknown
speaker
yes.
i
mean,
she
had
all
sorts
of
reasons
why
one
could
be
skeptical
of
her.
maybe
she
told
the
truth
100
percent
and
stoltzfus
apparently
did
not,
but
nevertheless,
the
way
they
appear
to
the
jury
you
can't
be
sure
which
one
seemed
the
more
credible.
unknown
speaker
the
honorable
court
is
now
adjourned
until
monday
next
at
ten
o'clock.
