justice
john
paul
stevens
the
second
case
i
have
to
announce
comes
from
the
untied
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
fourth
circuit.
it
is
strickler
versus
greene
the
warden.
in
1990
tommy
strickler
was
tried
on
various
charges,
including
capital
murder
and
kidnapping
in
connection
with
the
abduction
and
death
of
a
young
college
student.
one
of
the
principal
witnesses
of
strickler’s
trial
was
a
woman
named
anne
stoltzfus
who
claimed
to
be
an
eyewitness
to
the
kidnapping.
at
strickler
trial
she
testified
to
the
abduction
in
killing
in
vivid
detail.
strickler
was
then
convicted
and
sentenced
to
death.
when
preparing
for
federal
habeas
corpus,
strickler’s
lawyers
discover
several
documents
in
the
police
department
files
that
cast
serious
doubt
on
the
voracity
of
stoltzfus
trial
testimony.
it
is
undisputed
that
strickler’s
lawyer
had
never
seen
at
least
five
of
those
documents.
in
his
petition
for
federal
habeas
corpus
strickler,
alleged
that
his
trial
had
been
fundamentally
unfair
and
had
violated
the
rule
announced
by
our
decision
in
brady
against.
maryland
because
of
the
prosecutor’s
failure
to
disclose
these
documents.
the
district
court
agreed
in
granted
the
writ
of
the
habeas
corpus.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fourth
circuit
reversed
finding
that
strickler
could
have
but
did
not
raises
his
brady
claim
earlier
and
therefore
the
claim
was
procedurally
defaulted.
in
technical
terms
the
fourth
circuit
concluded
that
strickler
could
not
demonstrate
cause
and
prejudice
sufficient
to
overcome
a
procedural
default.
the
fourth
circuit
also
commented
that
strickler’s
brady
claim
wasn’t
any
of
that
without
maryland.
we
granted
certiorari
and
we
now
affirm,
although
our
reasoning
differs
significantly
from
that
use
by
the
fourth
circuit.
unlike
the
fourth
circuit
we
find
the
strickler
has
demonstrated
three
reasons
sufficient
to
show
cause
for
failing
to
raise
his
brady
claim
earlier.
first
the
prosecution
withheld
the
materials
and
teaching
stoltzfus
testimony
from
strickler.
second
strickler
reasonably
relied
on
the
prosecutor’s
open
file
policy
contained
all
of
the
materials
that
prosecution
needed
to
disclose
under
brady.
third
the
prosecutor
had
assured
strickler’s
lawyer
that
strickler
had
received
“everything
known
to
government”
therefore
strickler
did
demonstrate
cause.
in
addition
we
find
that
strickler
established
two
of
the
three
elements
necessary
to
show
a
violation
of
brady
against
maryland.
the
evidence
related
to
stoltzfus
was
favorable
to
strickler’s
case
and
the
prosecution
failed
to
disclose
those
materials
to
strickler.
nevertheless
and
although
the
question
is
closed,
so
we
ultimately
conclude
that
strickler
cannot
make
out
the
third
element
of
the
brady
claim
namely
that
he
suffered
sufficient
prejudice
from
the
prosecution’s
failure
to
disclose
the
evidence
to
undermine
our
confidence
in
the
jury’s
verdict.
accordingly
we
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals.
justice
thomas
concurs
in
part
and
concurs
in
the
judgment;
justice
souter
joined
in
part
by
justice
kennedy
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
part
and
dissenting
in
part.
