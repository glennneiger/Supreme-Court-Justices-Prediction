justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
in
view
of
the
importance
of
the
case
it
seems
appropriate
to
read
some
portions
of
rather
lengthily
dissent.
a
vital
safeguard
for
the
federal
balance
is
the
requirement
that
when
congress
imposes
a
condition
on
the
states'
receipt
of
federal
funds
it
must
do
so
unambiguously.
only
if
states
receive
clear
notice
of
the
conditions
attached
to
federal
funds
can
they
guard
against
excessive
federal
intrusion
into
state
affairs
and
be
vigilant
in
policing
the
boundaries
of
federal
power.
while
the
majority
opinion
purports
to
give
effect
to
these
principles,
in
fact
it
eviscerates
the
clear-notice
safeguard
of
our
spending
clause
jurisprudence.
the
majority's
opinion
purports
to
be
narrow,
but
the
limiting
principle
it
proposes
are
illusory.
the
fence
the
court
has
built
has
made
of
little
sticks,
and
it
cannot
contain
the
avalanche
of
liability
now
set
in
motion.
the
potential
costs
to
our
schools
of
today's
decision
are
difficult
to
estimate.
but
it
is
clear,
they
are
so
great
that
it
is
most
unlikely
congress
intended
to
inflict
them
on
the
states.
rather
than
beginning
with
a
language
of
title
ix
itself,
the
majority
begins
with
our
last
term's
decision
in
gebser.
it
appears
to
discover
there
are
sweeping
legal
duty-divorced
from
agency
principles
for
schools
to
remedy
third-party
discrimination
against
students.
it
should
surprise
no
one,
however,
the
schools,
which
are
the
primary
locus
of
most
children's
social
development
are
rife
with
inappropriate
behavior
by
children
who
are
just
learning
to
interact
with
their
peers.
it
is
doubtless
the
case
moreover
that
much
of
this
inappropriate
behavior
is
directed
toward
members
of
the
opposite
sex,
as
children
in
the
throes
of
adolescence
struggle
to
express
their
emerging
sexual
identities.
it
is
a
far
different
question,
however,
whether
it
is
either
proper
or
useful
to
label
this
immature
or
childish
behavior
as
gender
discrimination.
nothing
in
title
ix
suggests
that
congress
even
contemplated
this
question,
much
less
answered
it
in
the
affirmative
and
in
unambiguous
terms.
there
is
no
established
body
of
federal
or
state
law,
in
which
courts
may
draw
in
defining
the
student
conduct
that
qualifies
that's
title
ix
gender
discrimination.
analogies
to
title
vii
hostile
environment
harassment,
precedents
are
inapposite
because
schools
are
not
workplaces
and
children
are
not
adults.
analogies
to
title
ix
teacher
sexual
harassments
of
students
are
similarly
flawed.
a
teacher's
sexual
overtures
towards
a
student
are
always
inappropriate.
a
teenager's
romantic
overtures
to
a
classmate,
even
when
persistent
and
unwelcome,
are
an
inescapable
part
of
adolescence.
the
difficulties
schools
will
encounter
in
identifying
peer
sexual
harassment
are
already
evident
in
teacher's
manuals
designed
to
give
guidance
on
the
subject.
for
example,
one
manual
suggests
that
one
student
saying
to
another,
you
look
nice,
could
be
sexual
harassment
depending
on
the
tone
of
voice,
how
the
student
looks
at
the
other,
and
who
else
is
around.
this
conclusion
will
likely
be
compounded
once
the
sexual
harassment
label
is
invested
with
the
force
of
federal
law
backed
up
by
the
private
damage
suits.
the
majority's
inability
to
provide
any
workable
definition
of
actionable
peer
harassment,
simply
underscores
the
myriad
ways,
in
which
an
opinion
that
purports
to
be
narrow
is
in
fact
so
broad
that
it
will
support
untold
members
of
lawyers,
who
will
prove
adept
at
presenting
cases
that
will
withstand
the
defendant
school
district's
pretrial
motions.
each
of
the
barriers
to
run-away
litigation,
the
majority
offers
us
crumbles
under
the
weight
of
even
casual
scrutiny.
for
example,
there
is
a
string
of
adjectives
the
majority
attaches
to
the
world
"harassment"
and
"severe,
pervasive,
and
objectively
offensive".
but
these
fail
to
narrow
the
class
of
conduct
that
can
trigger
liability,
since
the
touchtone
for
determining
whether
title
ix
viability
exists
is
the
effect
on
the
child's
ability
to
get
an
education.
the
majority
seems
oblivious
to
the
fact
with
almost
every
child
at
some
point
had
trouble
in
school
because
he
or
she
is
being
teased
by
his
or
her
peers.
most
children
responded
teasing
in
ways
that
detract
from
their
ability
to
learn.
the
prospect
of
unlimited
title
ix
liability
in
all
likelihood
will
breed
a
climate
of
fear
that
encourages
school
administrators
to
label
even
the
most
innocuous
of
child
conduct
sexual
harassment.
disregarding
state-law
remedies
for
student
misbehavior
and
incentives
that
our
schools
already
have
to
provide
the
best
possible
education
to
all
of
their
students,
the
majority
seeks
in
effective
put
an
end
student
misbehavior
by
transforming
title
ix
into
a
federal
student
civility
code.
in
the
final
analysis
this
case
is
about
federalism.
yet
the
majority's
decision
says
not
one
world
about
the
federal
balance.
preserving
our
federal
system
is
a
legitimate
end
in
itself.
it
is
to
the
means
to
other
ends.
it
ensures
that
essential
choices
can
be
made
by
a
government
more
approximate
to
the
people
than
the
vast
apparatus
of
federal
power.
defining
the
appropriate
role
of
schools
in
teaching
and
supervising
children,
who
are
beginning
to
explore
their
own
sexuality
and
learning
how
to
express
it
to
others,
is
one
of
the
most
complex
and
sensitive
issues
our
schools
face.
heedless
of
these
considerations,
the
court
rushes
forward
finding
that
the
cause
of
action
it
creates
is
necessary
to
affect
the
congressional
design.
it
is
not.
nothing
in
title
ix
suggest
that
congress
intended
the
result
the
court
reaches
today
much
less
dictated
it,
in
unambiguous
terms.
today's
decision
cannot
be
laid
at
the
feet
of
congress;
it
is
the
responsibility
of
the
court.
trusted
principles
of
federalism
are
superseded
by
a
more
contemporary
imperatives,
perhaps
the
most
grave
and
surely
the
more
lasting
disservice
of
today's
decision,
is
that
it
that
ensures
the
court's
own
disregard
for
the
federal
balance
soon
will
be
imparted
to
our
youngest
citizens.
the
court
clears
the
way
for
the
federal
government
to
claim
center
stage
in
america's
classrooms.
today's
decision
mandates
to
teachers
instructing
and
supervising
their
students
that
dubious
assistance
of
federal
court
plaintiffs
and
their
lawyers
and
makes
the
federal
courts
the
final
arbiters
of
school
policy
and
have
many
disagreements
between
students.
after
today,
johnny
will
find
that
routine
problems
of
adolescence
are
to
be
resolved
by
invoking
the
federal
right
to
demand
assignment
to
a
desk
two
rows
away.
if
there
will
be
any
doubt
of
the
futility
of
the
court's
attempt
to
hedge
its
holding
about
with
words
of
limitation
for
future
cases,
the
result
in
this
case
provides
the
answer.
the
complaint
of
this
fifth
grader
survives
and
the
school
will
be
compelled
to
answer
in
federal
court.
we
can
be
assured
that
like
suits
will
follow,
suits
which
in
cost
and
number
will
impose
serious
financial
burdens
on
local
school
districts,
the
taxpayers
who
support
them
and
the
children
they
serve.
federalism
and
our
struggling
school
systems
deserve
better
from
this
court.
as
justice
o'connor
has
already
indicated,
the
dissenting
opinion
has
been
joined
by
the
chief
justice
and
justices
scalia
and
thomas.
