unknown
speaker
may
i
ask,
ms.
williams,
how
you
would
propose
to
cabin
this
cause
of
action
were
we
to
agree
with
you?
i'm
sure
that
school
children
nationwide
tease
each
other,
and
little
boys
tease
little
girls,
and
so
forth
throughout
their
years
in
school.
and
is
every
one
of
those
incidents
going
to
lead
to
some
kind
of
a
lawsuit?
unknown
speaker
what
standards
would
you
think
would
govern
to
cabin
this
kind
of
a
cause
of
action?
unknown
speaker
gee,
but
little
girls
always
tease
little
boys
and
little
boys
always
tease
little
girls.
that's
pervasive.
unknown
speaker
in
my
experience,
it's...
it's
severe.
unknown
speaker
are
you
going
to
apply
a
reasonable...
a
reasonable
teenager
standard?
is
that...
is
that
the
criteria?
unknown
speaker
the
concern...
the
concern
is
i
think
that
if
you
simply
take
the
same
standards
of
title
vii,
i.e.,
anything
that
would
be
sexual
harassment
in
the
work
place,
when
done
by
a
co
worker
or
a
supervisor
to
a
subordinate
or
a
co
worker,
that
which
is
sexual
harassment
there
is
also
sexual
harassment
for
which
the
school
district
is
liable
when
a
7-year-old
does
it
to
a
6-year-old
or
a
13-year-old
to
a
12-year-old.
the
concern
is,
as
you've
said,
you
take
the
same
standards.
you
would
remove
what
is
a
pervasive
problem
in
the
schools
from
the
hands
of
educators
and
psychologists
and
give
that
problem
to
lawyers
and
judges.
now,
i
don't
think
the
latter
is
the
right
group
of
people
to
solve
it.
perhaps
it
is,
perhaps
it
isn't.
but
i
want
to
bring
out
into
the
open
what
i
think
is
the
problem
or
a
problem,
and
i
want
to
know
how
you...
anything
you
could
say
that
would
reassure
me
or
others
that...
how...
that
this
would...
what
i've
just
said
may
not
be
the
case.
unknown
speaker
i
think
then
that
every
school
district
in
the
nation
should
adopt
guidelines
and
codes,
as
we've
suggested
for
employers.
do
you
think
there
was
a
suggestion
in
the
congressional
debates
and
in
the
text
of
this
statute
that
there
would
be
federal
standards
for
school
behavior
in
every
classroom
in
this
country?
unknown
speaker
i
thought
this
was
a
federal
statute
we're
talking
about.
unknown
speaker
now,
let's...
let's...
let's
be
very
careful
here.
if
you're
going
to
have
standards,
they're
federal
standards,
are
they
not?
unknown
speaker
thank
you.
do
you
really
think
it...
it...
it
imposes
an
obligation
on
these
educational
institutions
to
prevent
anyone
being
denied
the
benefits
of
or
excluded
from
participation
in,
that's
what
it
requires
every
school
district
to
do?
unknown
speaker
well,
what
if...
what
if
parents,
benighted
as
they
may
be,
decide
that
they
don't
want
their
daughter
to
study
science
because
they
think
girls
shouldn't
study
science?
title
ix
makes
it
the
responsibility
of
the
school
district
to
prevent
that?
unknown
speaker
i...
i
suppose
the...
the
parents
are
under
the
control
of
the
institution
to
the
extent
that
the
institution
decides
what
course
ultimately
the
student
will
take.
and
if
the
institution
knows
that
the
parent
is...
is
depriving
this
child
from
taking
science,
because
the
parents
feel
that
the
girl
shouldn't
have
science,
surely
the
institution
can
prevent
that.
unknown
speaker
so,
you
think
the
language
cannot
be
read
literally,
that
it...
it
in
fact
does
not
mean
that
no
one...
when
it
says
no
one
shall
be
deprived
of
the
benefits
of
or
subjected
to
discrimination
under,
it
doesn't
mean
that
it's
the
responsibility
of
the
school
to
assure
absolutely
that
that
will
be
the
result.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
so,
it's
just
a
question
of
where
we
draw
the
line.
it's
just
a
question
of
where
we
draw
the
line.
you
acknowledge
that
they're
not
responsible
for
eliminating
the
effects
of
the
parental
discrimination
or
the
parental
desires,
and
the
question
before
us
is
whether
they
are
responsible
for
eliminating
the
effects
of
the...
of
the
children's
desires.
and
i
don't...
i
don't
know
why
it's
absolutely
clear
that...
that
there's
a
line
between
those
two.
unknown
speaker
so
is
the
parents'--
unknown
speaker
--so
is
the
parents'
determination
that...
that
the
child
shouldn't
take
science.
unknown
speaker
the...
the
parent...
the
school
has
control
over
what
courses
the
child
takes.
unknown
speaker
well,
in...
in
the
case
of
sexual
harassment,
i
take
it
the
school
has
the
duty
to
call
the
parent
in
and...
and
tell
the
parent
to
control
the
child.
correct?
unknown
speaker
all
right.
why
in
justice
scalia's
hypothetical
doesn't
the
school
have
the
duty
to
call
the
parent
in
to
say
not
to
impose
racial...
or
sexual
gender
stereotypes
on
the...
on
the
child?
i
don't
think
you're
answering
the
question.
unknown
speaker
well,
neither
is
the
student
in
every
situation.
is
it
possible
that
title
ix
liability
requires
that
the
action
of
harassment
be
done
by
an
agent
of
the
school
district?
unknown
speaker
in
gebser,
of
course,
it
was
a
teacher
and
the
teacher
was
an
agent
of
the
district.
so,
certainly
it's
possible
then
that
liability
would
be
focused
on
those
who
are
agents
of
the
district.
liability
of
the
district
would
depend
upon
actions
of
an
agent.
unknown
speaker
no.
it...
it
required
the
intentional
action
of
the
school
district,
but
it
also
happened
to
involve
action
by
an
agent.
and
so
i'm
asking
you
whether
both
are
required,
the
knowledge
and...
and...
and
neglect
of
the
school
district
to
control
behavior
that
it
knows
was
improper
by
an
agent,
or
can
it
be
anyone?
could
it
be
a
stranger
coming
in
and
doing
this
or
a
parent
who
frequently
comes
to
school
and
says
insulting
things
to
other
children?
would
the
school
district
be
liable
for
that?
unknown
speaker
that's
right,
but
it
was
carried
out
by
an
agent
of
the
school,
to
wit,
a
teacher.
unknown
speaker
ms.
williams,
i
thought
your
position
was
not
that
there's
responsibility
for
what
the
child
does,
the
way
there
might
be
for
a
teacher,
but
that
there
were
repeated
notice.
it
was
the
school's
nonresponse.
it
was
the
school's
conduct
and
not
the
fifth
grade
harasser's
conduct--
unknown
speaker
--that
renders
the...
the
district
liable.
but--
unknown
speaker
--but
that
response
is
blameworthy
only
if
the
school
has
an
obligation
to
act.
if
it
has
no
obligation
to
act,
its
failure
to
respond
shouldn't
subject
it
to
liability.
why
does
it
have
an
obligation
to
act
with
respect
to
two
little
kids
teasing
each
other
when
it
does
not
with
respect
to
a
parent
who...
who
decides
the
child
shall
take
particular
courses?
the
statute
requires
discrimination
under...
under...
a
program.
it
prohibits
discrimination
under
any
education
program.
i
always
thought
under
the
program
meant
that
the
program
itself
discriminated--
unknown
speaker
--not
that
the
program
stopped,
you
know,
contractors
or
the
students
themselves
or
the
parents
of
the
students
from
discriminating.
i
wouldn't
consider
that
discrimination
under
the
program.
unknown
speaker
any
failure
of
the
program
to
prevent
discrimination
which
it
has
the
power
to
prevent
constitutes
discrimination
under
the
program.
unknown
speaker
whether...
whether
its
their
agents
that
are
doing
it
or
not,
whatever
discrimination
by
the
public
at
large
the
school
can
prevent,
it
must
prevent.
unknown
speaker
i
understand.
unknown
speaker
but
if
it
knows
about
it,
it
must
prevent
it.
unknown
speaker
and
you
think
that
that
is
conveyed
by
the
language
discrimination
under
the
program.
unknown
speaker
the
students
themselves
are
not
committing
a
legal
wrong,
are
they,
in...
in
the
usual
sexual
harassment
case?
there
was
a
battery
here,
but
in...
in
most
cases
that
you
have
in
mind,
the
students
aren't
committing
a
legal
wrong,
are
they?
unknown
speaker
they
are
not
committing
a
legal
wrong
under
federal
law.
they
are
not...
they
have
no
liability,
do
they?
unknown
speaker
johnny
harasses
mary.
that
is
not
a
legal
wrong
on
the
part
of
johnny.
unknown
speaker
all
right.
it's...
it's
an
odd,
unusual,
not
unknown
scheme
that
we
impute
liability
to
the
principal
for
an
act
that
is
not
wrong
when
done
by
the
actor.
unknown
speaker
but
he
has
no...
he
has
no
legal
liability
under
the
statute.
unknown
speaker
and
that...
that
applies
to
the
parents
as
well.
unknown
speaker
i
mean,
if
the
parents
don't
want
their
daughters
to
take
science
or
don't
their...
their
sons
to
take
ballet,
the...
the...
that's
okay.
but
the
school
which
has
the
power
to
determine
whether
the
children
will
take
ballet
or
science
can,
in
effect,
stop
the
parents
from
that...
from
that...
i
don't
know...
wicked
action
or
whatever
the
action
is
considered.
unknown
speaker
let
me
ask
you
a
definitional
question.
let's
assume
we
get
to
the
point
of
saying
that
student
to
student
behavior
can
be
a
predicate
for
the
school's
obligation
here.
how
does
the...
how
does
the
school
define
in
its
guidelines,
be
they
formal
or
informal,
the...
the
concept
of
the
harassment
that
amounts
to
discrimination,
as
you
put
it,
as
distinguished
simply
from...
from
teasing
which
may
be
pervasive.
i
mean,
in
the
first
grade,
boys
tease
girls
because
they
are
girls
and
vice
versa.
i
presume
that
all
of
that
is
not
supposed
to
be
subject
to
a...
in
effect,
an
enforceable
federal
standard.
but
how
would...
a,
am
i
correct
in
assuming
that
on
your
view
it
would
not
be,
and--
unknown
speaker
--b,
if
i
am
correct,
could
you
give
me
an
idea
of
how
you
would
state
the
definitional
line
that
divides
one
from
the
other?
unknown
speaker
but
it...
it
is
on
the
basis
of
sex,
though.
unknown
speaker
i
mean,
it's
because
they're
girls
and
because
they're
boys.
unknown
speaker
well,
but
it
can
be.
i
mean,
you
know,
little
gangs
form
in
schools
and
it
can
be
very
pervasive
and
very
distressing
to
kids.
and
it's
done
on
a
sexual
basis.
it's
done
because
the...
the
receivers
are
girls
or
boys
and
the
givers
are
vice...
boys
or...
or
girls.
so...
so,
it
can
be
pervasive.
unknown
speaker
and
it
certainly
is
on
the
basis
of
sex.
but
i
presume
that
still
you
would
draw
a
line.
unknown
speaker
right,
but...
and
how--
unknown
speaker
--how...
what's
the...
how
do
you
state
the
line
because
your
time
is
getting
short.
unknown
speaker
but
that's
part
of
the
problem
because
under
the
title
vii
standards
in
the
work
place,
i'm
sure
the
kind
of
behavior
that
occurs
at
schools
between
children
would
be
actionable.
so,
how
do
we
apply
it
in
the
student
context?
unknown
speaker
thank
you,
ms.
williams.
ms.
underwood,
we'll
hear
from
you.
unknown
speaker
excuse
me.
the
what
question?
unknown
speaker
oh,
cabining
principle.
unknown
speaker
but
i
take
it
if...
if
it
is
pervasive,
you
know,
if
the
kids
gang
up
and
the
one...
the...
the
object
of
the
teasing
really
is...
is...
is
left
incapable
of
getting
the
benefit
of
the
education,
i
take
it
your
answer
is...
implicit
in
your
answer
is
there's...
there's
no
principle
line
between
harassment
and
what
we
call
teasing
by...
by
primary
grade
children.
unknown
speaker
excuse
me.
why...
why
does
it
have
to
deprive
someone
of
the
ability
to
get
an
education?
that's
not
what
the
statute
says.
that's
a
separate
basis
for
violation;
that
is,
be
denied
the
benefits
of.
all
it
says
is,
be
subjected
to
discrimination
under.
why...
why...
i
don't
know
why
you
insist
that
it
be
so
severe
that
the
person
can't
even
learn.
unknown
speaker
this
is
true...
i
can't
believe
that
you're...
i
mean,
i...
i
doubt...
you
seem
to
be
saying
that
if...
if
x
is
sexual
harassment
when
a
teacher
does
it
to
a
student,
it
is
sexual
harassment
when
a
student
does
it
to
a
student,
when
an
employer
does
it
to
an
employee,
and
the
concern...
i'll
take
that
as
a
given.
maybe
you'll
deny
that.
i
hope...
maybe
you
should.
but...
but...
but
if
that's
the
given,
what's
the
concern
i
think
is
that
whereas
one
might
have
no
hesitance
about
insisting
in
the
work
place
that
if
they
don't
shape
up,
they
can
be
sued,
at
a
school
there
are
many,
many
incidents
where
the
proper
response
seems
to
be
a
kind
of
discussion,
mediation,
getting
together
with
a
family,
bringing
in
psychologists,
all
kinds
of
things
that
don't
seem
appropriate
in
the
work
place.
and
i
guess
my
concern
anyway
is...
is
there
some
way
for
the
law
to
be
sensitive
to
that
other
than
opening
up
a
can
of
worms
so
that
when,
as
happened,
in
school
x
which
had
a
group
of
girls
that
were
bigger
than
the
boys
and
they
used
to
beat
them
up
after
class,
all
right,
the
way
the
school
responds
is
not
with
lawsuits?
the
way
the
school
responds
is
through
discussion
and
mediation
and
so
forth,
all
kinds
of
ways
of
response.
what's
worrying
is
the
gearing
up
of
the
great
legal
mechanism
to
supersede
that.
unknown
speaker
well,
but
if
it
continues
again,
there's
another
incidence
of
it,
it
fails,
then
there
you
go.
you're
marching
off
to
court
to
resolve
these
issues.
unknown
speaker
well,
that's
very
true,
but
i
think
our
concern
is...
is
a
slightly
different
concern,
and
that
is,
if
there
is,
as...
as...
as
seems
to
be
developing,
no
principle
line
between
sexual
harassment
at
the...
at
the...
in
effect,
at
the
high
end
of
the
scale
in
high
school
and...
and
teasing
in
the
first
grade,
then
in
every
case
in
which
there
is
pervasive
teasing,
which
we
all
know
goes
on,
there
is
a
potential
federal
case
here
whenever
the
parents
are
dissatisfied
with
the
actions,
which
you
quite
rightly
describe
any
reasonable
school
should
take.
and
i
think
the
concern
is
that
there
is
no
way
really
in
principle
to
draw
a
line
between
every
act
of
teasing
and...
and
a
subject
of
federal
litigation.
unknown
speaker
well,
that
goes
to
the...
that
goes
to
the
school's
response
when
it
gets
into
court.
unknown
speaker
but
it
still
remains
the
case
that
the
school
is
going
to
be
subject
to...
to
a
federal
court
action,
and
it
is
going
to
be
federal
guidelines
which
will
be
implicated
by
the
claim
for
every
first
grade
pervasive
teasing
incident.
that's
the
concern.
unknown
speaker
well,
is
it
possible
that
under
title
ix
the
harasser
must
be
an
agent
of
the
school
district
and
the
district
must
have
actual
knowledge
and
act
with
deliberate
indifference?
is
that
a
possible
interpretation
of
that
statute?
unknown
speaker
you...
you
keep
saying
that.
i
don't
know
why
you
can
say
that.
if...
if
you
are
correct
about
what
title
ix
provides,
you
don't
have
to...
it
doesn't
have
to
be
so
severe
as
to
deny
the
person
the
benefits
of
the
program.
unknown
speaker
i
suppose
that's
right,
but...
but--
--i
agree
with
justice
scalia.
--all
it
has
to
be
is
discrimination
on
the
basis
of
sex
which
the
school
is
aware
of.
unknown
speaker
and
fails
to
respond
to.
unknown
speaker
but
the
point...
but
the
point
is
you
do
not
have
to
show,
under
the
statute,
as
justice
scalia
suggests
and
as
i
understand
it,
that
the
students
cannot
learn
as
well.
suppose
the
student
comes
home
in
tears...
most
students
do
one...
one
or
more
times...
and
decides
that
what
that
student
will
do
is
to
really
study
hard
and
to
excel.
is
there
discrimination
there?
unknown
speaker
but
not...
ms.
underwood,
i
think
the
point
is
are
you
distinguishing
between
the
student
who
can't
learn
she's
so
upset
or
the
one
who
says,
this
is
horrible.
i'm
being
exposed
to
this
horrible
thing
every
day,
but
i'm
going
stand
up
against
it.
the
same
thing
that
came
up
in
harris
against
forklift.
unknown
speaker
thank
you,
ms.
underwood.
mr.
plowden,
we'll
hear
from
you.
unknown
speaker
mr.
plowden,
can
i
give
you
a
hypothetical
that
occurred
to
me
as
i
listened
to
the
dialogue
in
the
last
argument?
unknown
speaker
just
let's
get
away
from
the
sexual
harassment
scenario
for
just
a
moment.
suppose
you
had
a...
a
baseball
field
and
the
rules
of
the
school
said,
after
school
there
will
be
an
hour
for
women...
or
the
female
students
and
an
hour
for
the
male
students.
and
that's
the
rule.
it's
perfectly
clear.
that's
the
rule
policy.
but,
in
fact,
the
boys
decide
they
want
the...
the
field
for
2
hours,
and
they're
just
not
going
to
let
the
girls
on.
and
they
do
that
over
and
over
and
over
again,
and
the
athletic
director
knows
about
it
but
does
nothing
about
it.
and
he
says,
well,
our
rule
is
it's
equal
time
for
both.
is
there
a
cause
of
action?
is
that
discrimination
in
violation
of
the
statute?
unknown
speaker
misconduct
for
the
adult
in
my
hypothetical
is
that
the
adult
did
nothing
about
it
when
fully
informed
as
to
what
happened.
unknown
speaker
correct.
unknown
speaker
and
as
a
result
of
their
conduct,
week
after
week
after
week,
they
have
exclusive
use
of
the
athletic
facility,
and
that
would
not,
in
your
view,
violate
the
statute.
unknown
speaker
what
is
your
view
on
my
hypothetical?
unknown
speaker
that
wouldn't...
that
would
not
violate
title
ix.
unknown
speaker
well,
you've
given
me
two
answers.
is
it
a
violation
of
title
ix?
unknown
speaker
no
you
state.
unknown
speaker
not
even
for
purposes
of
injunctive
relief
to
say
to
the
school,
you
put
a
teacher
on
that
field
to
make
sure
the
girls
have
their
equal
time.
unknown
speaker
i
don't
follow
that.
i
mean,
if
it's
a
violation
of
the
statute,
then
ocr
can
enforce
it.
if
it's
not
a
violation
of
the
statute,
then
they
can't
enforce
it.
unknown
speaker
no,
but
they
can't
enforce
anything
given
your
answer
to
justice
stevens
because
there
has
been
no
violation.
so,
if...
if
i
understand
your
answer
to
justice
stevens,
there
could
never
be
injunctive
action.
is
that
correct?
unknown
speaker
and
that
would
be
true
even
if...
if
the
action
of
the
boy
students
were
to
block
admission
of
the
girls
to
a
science
class,
a
group
of
students
who
said,
we're
not
going
to
let
girls
in
here.
out
of
here.
and
the
teacher
knows
that,
the
principal
knows
it,
and
the
girls
don't
get
to
take
a
class
they
want
to
take.
no...
no
violation
of
title
ix
and
no
injunctive
relief
possible
at
the
instance
of
the
federal
officials.
unknown
speaker
how
could
they
get
relief
if
there
is
no
violation
of
the
statute?
unknown
speaker
oh,
a
raised
eyebrow.
you
mean
you...
you
can...
you
can
muscle
them.
even
though
it's
not
really
a
violation,
they...
they
will--
unknown
speaker
--snap
to
attention
if...
well--
unknown
speaker
--you
don't
want
us
to
sanction
that
sort
of
thing,
do
you?
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
is
it
possible--
--what
gebser
focused
on,
of
course,
was
the
concept
that
if
the
school
district
has
actual
knowledge
of
the
problem
and
is
deliberately
indifferent
to
it,
then
there
can
be
liability.
unknown
speaker
now,
that
does
offer
some
kind
of
standard.
it
isn't
a
negligence
standard.
unknown
speaker
well,
what's
wrong--
--i
understand
what
the...
what
the...
exactly...
i
assume
if
the
situation
in
justice
stevens'
hypothetical
were
that
the...
the
male
students
were
making
use
of
a...
of
a...
a
school
facility,
for
example,
holding
the
gates
shut
or
something
of
that
sort,
i
assume
you
could
say
that
it
is
the
responsibility
of
the
coach
or
whoever
has
authority
over
the
field
to
keep
that
gate
open
regardless
of...
regardless
of
what
the
male
students
are
doing.
i
mean,
in
some...
in
some
situations
at
least,
you
would
be
able
to
find
affirmative
action
on
the
part
of
an
agent
of
the
school
which
is
causing
these...
these
young
women
to
be
excluded
from
the
athletic
facilities.
unknown
speaker
and
you'd
have
no
problem
with
finding
liability
there.
unknown
speaker
something
more
than
merely...
merely
refusing
to
punish
these
boys
for
something
that
they
do
off
of
the
school
grounds.
unknown
speaker
no.
my
hypothetical
is
that
the--
unknown
speaker
--what
the
adult
member
of
the
school
staff
does
is
nothing.
he
does
nothing
with
full
knowledge.
he
doesn't
do
anything
affirmatively,
and
you
say
there's
no
liability
in
that
case.
unknown
speaker
even
if
not
only
they...
not
only
do
they
exclude
them
from
the...
from
the
field,
but
they
also
happen
to
beat
them
up
or
something
like
that
because
they
really
want
to
teach
them
a
lesson,
there's
still
no
liability.
unknown
speaker
no
federal
liability.
unknown
speaker
i
think
we
need
a
federal
law
to
solve
that
problem--
--well,
that's
the
question.
--of...
of
young...
young
men
beating
up
young
women.
before
you
leave
that,
could...
could--
unknown
speaker
--i
mean,
what
justice
o'connor
i
think
was
suggesting
possibly
is
the
possibility
of
creating
a
standard
that's
strict
enough
to
stop
the
administrative
problem
that
you're
worried
about.
now,
suppose
you
did
combine
what
she
suggested,
which
is
that
the
school
district
needs
actual
knowledge
and
virtually
doesn't
respond
at
all,
with
what
i
think
was
implicit
in
your
opponent's
suggestion
that
maybe
the
harassment
would
have
to
rise
to
the
level
of
a
significant
denial
of
the
program's
benefit.
now,
if
you
put
those
two
things
together,
the
significant
denial
of
the
program's
benefit
so
it
isn't
just
teasing
or
things
that
the
kids
can
get
over,
together
with
a
very
strict
standard
of
liability
such
that
the
school
district
has
to
actually
know
and
its
response
has
to
be
nonexistent
or
grossly
inadequate...
if
you
put
those
two
things
together,
would
you
leave
the
kind
of
leeway
for
the
school
district
that
i
think
i
suggested
might
be
desirable
and
that
you
apparently
think
is
desirable?
unknown
speaker
under
the
standard
proposed
by
justice
breyer,
are
you
confident
how
the
case
at
bar
would
come
out?
unknown
speaker
under
the
standard
proposed
by
justice
breyer,
are
you
confident
in
knowing
how
this
case
would
come
out?
unknown
speaker
i
was
simply
taking
justice
o'connor's
idea
that
the
school
district
has
to
know
exactly
and
they
have
to
have
no
response
or
a
grossly
inadequate
response,
virtually
no
response,
and
in
addition,
the
harassment
has
to
rise
to
the
level
of
denying
the
significant
benefit
of
the
program,
which
i
think
was
discussed
on
the
other
side.
so,
it
can't
those
are
the
ideas
of
keeping
the
teasing
out,
of
keeping
anything,
even
ordinary,
you
know...
well,
i
won't
repeat
it.
unknown
speaker
very
high.
quite
high.
unknown
speaker
and
you
would
say
the
same
thing
under
title
vi
for
race
then?
let's
say
that
there's
a
racial
minority
in
the
school,
and
the
racial
majority
on
the
playing
field
during
recess
is
beating
up
on
the
minority,
and
the
teachers
stand
by.
they're
not
affirmatively
encouraging
anything.
they're
just
not
stopping
it.
there
would
also
be
no
liability
under
title
vi?
unknown
speaker
do
we...
do
we
have
to
be
concerned
at
all
with
the
fact
that
in
public
schools,
in
any
event,
the
children
are
compelled
by
law
to
attend
and
the
school
does
act
as
a
sort
of
in
loco
parentis
situation
during
the
school
day?
does
that
impose
responsibility
on
a
school
as
a
result
that
we
have
to
be
concerned
about
here
that
might
be
part
and
parcel
of
the
background
of
title
ix?
unknown
speaker
mr.
plowden,
i
may
have
missed
it
in
your
description.
is
there
a
remedy
under
state
law
against
the
school
board
if
it
totally
ignores
a
serious
problem?
unknown
speaker
no,
no.
what
is
the
authority
of
the
schools
in...
in...
in
your...
in
your
state?
do
the
schools
have
authority
to
expel
students
or
discipline
them
for
things
that
they
do
off
the
school
grounds?
i
mean,
suppose
this
harassment
is
going
on
before
the
students
get
to
school?
can...
can...
is
there
authority--
unknown
speaker
--what
is...
what
is
the
extent?
unknown
speaker
so,
if
it's
sort
of
generalized
harassment
that
occurs
off
the
school
grounds,
you'd
say
that
they
have
no...
probably
have
no
authority,
but
if
it
is
harassment
that
relates
specifically
to
what
goes
on
at
school,
even
if
it
occurs
off
the
school
grounds,
you
think
they
would
have
authority.
unknown
speaker
of
course,
the
text
of
title
ix
here
is...
i
mean,
it
speaks
very
broadly.
it
says,
no
person
shall,
on
the
basis
of
sex,
be
excluded
from...
be
excluded...
it's
in
the
passive...
be
excluded
from
participation
in,
be
denied
the
benefits
of,
or
be
subjected
to
discrimination.
it
doesn't
say
who
has
to
do
this
act
which
results
in
the
being.
unknown
speaker
so,
technically
under
the
words
of
the
statute,
why
couldn't
we
say
that
the
individual
students
are
in
violation
of
section
ix?
unknown
speaker
in
justice
stevens'
example,
why
couldn't
we
say
that
the
students
who
prevent
the
girls
from
entering
the
field
violates
section
ix
themselves?
unknown
speaker
well,
that's
one
way
to
read
it,
to
read
as...
as
implicitly
saying
shall
not
be
excluded
by
the
person
who
runs
the
program,
but
that's
not
really
in
there.
and
certainly
another
way
to
read
it
is
that
anyone
who
excludes
someone
from
participation
in
a...
in
a
school
program
that's
federally
funded
violates
title
ix.
unknown
speaker
you
could
read
it
that
way,
couldn't
you?
unknown
speaker
how
has
it
been
read
by
the
agency
that
administers
it?
title
ix
has
been
around
now
for
over
a
quarter
of
a
century.
and
a
basic
question
like
that,
who
does
the
statute...
who
is
the
object
of
the
statute...
hasn't
there
been
something--
unknown
speaker
--but
not
just...
justice
scalia's
question
didn't
go
to
sexual
harassment.
it's
who
is
responsible
under
title
ix.
you
answered
it
is
the
recipient
of
federal
funds.
unknown
speaker
it
is
not
the...
the
student
in
the
school.
unknown
speaker
well,
one
thing...
one
thing
is
what
the
recipient
is
responsible
for,
but
where
do
you
get
the
limitation
of
title
ix
to
the
recipient
of
federal
funds?
i
think--
unknown
speaker
--but
we
don't
know
from
that
whether...
what
the
definition
of
harassment
was.
everyone
agrees
it's
got
to
be
pervasive.
it's
got
to
be
repeated,
and
the
school
has
to
be
deliberately
indifferent.
in
the
survey
that
you're
referring
to,
anybody
who
had
been...
had
one
exposure
could
answer
yes.
unknown
speaker
and
that
certainly
is
not
what
anyone
says
would
be...
would
trigger
liability
under
title
ix.
unknown
speaker
well,
it's
only
money.
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
it's
not...
it's
not
only
money.
isn't
it...
isn't
it
a
necessary
consequence
of
the
position
the
petitioners
argued
that
there
will
be
a
federal
code
of
conduct
in
every
classroom
in
the
country?
unknown
speaker
mr.
plowden,
i
understand
the...
the
problem
that
people
have
been
wrestling
with,
that
is,
how
do
you
draw
the
line
between
rough
stuff
teasing
and
harassment
that's
covered.
but
on
the
other
hand,
i
don't
understand
why
it's
so
hard
to
separate
negligence
from
deliberate
indifference,
that
it
means
you
have
to
know
and
you
have
to
deliberately
not
do
anything
about
it.
it
seems
to
me
that
that's
not
a
hard
standard
to
define
and
apply.
unknown
speaker
would
your
answer
be
the
same
if
it
were
racial
harassment?
unknown
speaker
i
mean,
suppose...
you
know,
imagine
very,
very
severe
racial
harassment
by
students
against
someone
who
was
different
racially
and...
and
they
can't
use
the
program.
unknown
speaker
to
the
point
where
they
can't
benefit
from
the
educational
program.
is
it
likely
that
the
congress
wanted
that
to
be
ignored?
unknown
speaker
no,
but
you
still
have...
it
seems
to
me
you
have
the
same
hypothetical
in
the
black/white
situation.
the
white
boys
say,
this
field
is
for
whites
only,
and
the...
and
the...
and
the
school
does
nothing.
you
still
say
that...
there's
no
liability
there.
unknown
speaker
you
have
to
say
that.
unknown
speaker
well,
does
title
ix
cover
racial
discrimination?
no,
i'm
talking
about
title
vi.
unknown
speaker
and
they
work
the
same
way,
the
two,
with
respect
to
the...
to
the
mechanism,
the
private
right
of
action
and
the
ocr
authority.
unknown
speaker
the
statute
in
front
of
us
is
written
in
the...
i
guess
the
passive
voice.
no
person
shall
be
subjected.
it
seems
to
me
that...
that
aids
somewhat
the
construction
that
the
petitioner
is
urging
on
us.
schools
simply
have
a
duty
to
ensure
that
the
prohibited
conduct
doesn't
happen
no
matter
who
causes
it.
unknown
speaker
that's
a
permissible
reading
it--
unknown
speaker
--well,
if
you
give
it
that
reading,
you
don't
have
to
sue
the
school.
you
could...
you
could
sue
the
individual
kids
who...
who
are
doing
the
sexual
taunting--
unknown
speaker
--or
the...
the
individual
students
who
are
excluding
people
from
the
playing
field.
unknown
speaker
no.
i
mean,
if
you
accept
justice
kennedy's
position
that
the
passive
voice
is
the
passive
voice.
unknown
speaker
has
any
court
ever
done
that?
unknown
speaker
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
98-843,
davis
vresus
the
monroe
county
board
of
education
will
be
announced
by
justice
o'connor.
this
case
is
here
on
appeal
from
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
eleventh
circuit.
title
ix
of
the
education
amendments
of
1972
provides
that
no
person
in
the
united
states
shall,
on
the
basis
of
sex,
be
excluded
from
participation
and
be
denied
the
benefits
of,
or
be
subjected
to
discrimination
under
any
educational
program
or
activity
receiving
federal
financial
assistance.
in
this
case,
the
petitioner
filed
suit
seeking
damages
and
other
relief
under
title
ix
against
the
respondent
school
board.
the
petitioner
alleged
that
her
fifth
grade
daughter,
lashonda
had
repeatedly
been
the
victim
of
a
fellow
student's
sexually
offensive
comments
and
actions
over
a
five
month
period.
not
withstanding
notice
of
the
misconduct,
the
teachers
and
that
the
school
principal,
petitioner
alleged
that
no
disciplinary
action
was
taken
against
the
offending
student.
although
the
school
failed
for
many
months
even
to
change
lashonda's
assigned
seat
next
to
the
student,
who
was
harassing
her,
the
student's
misconduct
was
sufficiently
severe
to
warrant
criminal
charges
and
he
ultimately
pleaded
guilty
to
sexual
battery.
the
district
court
dismissed
petitioner's
title
ix
claim
and
the
en
banc
court
of
appeals
for
eleventh
circuit
affirmed
the
dismissal,
concluding
that
title
ix
does
not
create
a
private
damages
action
for
a
school's
failure
to
respond
the
reports
of
student-on-student
sexual
harassment.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
of
the
court
today,
we
reverse
the
court
of
appeals
decision
and
remand
for
further
proceedings.
in
our
decision
last
term
in
gebser
versus
lago
vista
independent
school
district,
we
concluded
that
title
ix
supports
a
private
damages
action
against
the
school
district,
which
receives
federal
funds
in
cases
of
sexual
harassment
of
a
student
by
a
teacher,
where
the
recipient
school
district
remained
deliberately
indifferent
to
known
acts
of
sexual
harassment.
in
the
opinion
filed
today,
we
conclude
that
school
boards,
which
are
federal
funding
recipients
may
likewise
be
liable
where
they
remain
deliberately
indifferent
to
known
acts
of
sufficiently
severe
peer
harassment
in
their
schools.
remindful
that
as
legislation
enacted
pursuant
to
congress'
authority
under
the
constitution's
spending
clause
that
title
ix
must
provide
the
putative
recipients,
the
schools
accepting
the
money,
with
notice
of
the
scope
of
their
potential
liability
should
they
choose
to
accept
federal
funds.
reading
the
statute
with
this
notice
requirement
in
mind,
we
conclude
that
student-on-student
harassment
must
be
so
severe,
pervasive,
and
objectively
offensive
that
it
can
be
said
to
deprive
its
victims
of
access
to
a
school's
educational
programs
or
activities.
recognizing
the
practical
and
legal
constraints
facing
school
administrators,
we
also
make
clear
that
funding
recipient
school
board
can
be
liable
in
damages
only
where
its
response
to
the
harassment,
is
clearly
unreasonable.
in
various
ways
federal
law
affects
the
ability
of
school
administrators
to
discipline
their
students
and
the
law
sometimes
works
to
deter
disciplinary
action.
title
ix
cuts
in
the
opposite
direction;
it
encourages
schools
to
fulfill
their
obligation
to
protect
students
from
extreme
misconduct
by
their
peers.
the
dissent
urges
that
the
court's
holding
today
will
teach
little
johnny
a
perverse
lessons
in
federalism.
in
fact,
title
ix
works
to
ensure
that
little
mary
may
attend
class
unhindered
by
severe
and
pervasive
acts
of
the
sexual
harassment
by
her
classmate.

kennedy

oinion

justice,

thomas
