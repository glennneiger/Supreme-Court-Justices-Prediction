mr.
w.
warren
plowden,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
petitioner
is
asking
this
court
to
create
a
private
claim
for
damages
under
title
ix
by
applying
adult
standards
of
hostile
environment
sex
harassment
to
children.
like
other
school
districts,
monroe
county's
has
the
obligation
to
educate
all
of
the
students,
all
of
the
children,
as
they
go
through
various
developmental
stages
from
k-5
through
12th
grade.
throughout
these
years,
45
million
children,
grades
k-12,
struggle
to
sort
out
the
differences
between
boys
and
girls,
acting
out
these
relationships,
flirting,
repeating
newly
learned
vulgarities--
mr.
w.
warren
plowden,
jr.
--certainly,
your
honor.
mr.
w.
warren
plowden,
jr.
your
honor,
we
draw
a
bright
line
here
between
acts
of
misconduct
of
adults
on
the
one
hand,
as
you
had
in
gebser,
and
the
acts
of
misconduct
of
children.
mr.
w.
warren
plowden,
jr.
yes,
sir,
but
the
underlying
predicate
for
that,
presumably
the
intent
to
discriminate,
is
the
group
of
boys
that
are--
mr.
w.
warren
plowden,
jr.
--that
are
shuffling
the
girls
off--
mr.
w.
warren
plowden,
jr.
--if
your
honor
please,
i--
mr.
w.
warren
plowden,
jr.
--i
still
would
not
agree
that
that's
a
violation
of
title
ix--
mr.
w.
warren
plowden,
jr.
--for...
for
which
someone
could
take
my
client
into
court
and
sue
them
for
damages.
no,
sir.
mr.
w.
warren
plowden,
jr.
no,
sir.
mr.
w.
warren
plowden,
jr.
no.
mr.
w.
warren
plowden,
jr.
if
your
honor
please,
i
believe
that...
that
ocr
can
enforce
title
ix,
as
it
does
every
day,
against
schools
with...
there's
no
requirement.
this...
this
is
in
gebser.
ocr
can
enforce
the
mandate
of...
of
the
requirement
even
if
it
doesn't
purport
to
represent
a
definition
of
discrimination.
mr.
w.
warren
plowden,
jr.
well,
you...
if
your
honor
please,
the
opinion
for
the
court
in
gebser
says
that
they
can
enforce
the
nondiscrimination
mandate
even
if
the
requirement
they
impose
does
not
purport
to
represent
a
definition
of
discrimination.
mr.
w.
warren
plowden,
jr.
that's
correct.
mr.
w.
warren
plowden,
jr.
no,
your
honor.
no
injunctive
relief
in
federal
court,
but
parents
can
get
relief
by
complaining
to
ocr
and
going
through
the
express
statutory
remedy
that
is
set
out
in
title
ix.
mr.
w.
warren
plowden,
jr.
ocr
frequently,
many
times,
comes
down,
investigates,
finds
a
potential
violation,
and
then
enters
into
negotiations
with--
mr.
w.
warren
plowden,
jr.
--that's--
mr.
w.
warren
plowden,
jr.
--your
honor,
that's
exactly--
mr.
w.
warren
plowden,
jr.
--well,
i'd
a
whole
lot
rather
you
sanction
that
than
open
up
the
courthouse
door
to
all
of
these
kinds
of
lawsuits
that
we're
liable
to
face
here.
and...
and
gebser
says
exactly
that,
your
honor
please.
mr.
w.
warren
plowden,
jr.
yes,
deliberate
indifference.
mr.
w.
warren
plowden,
jr.
oh,
no,
ma'am.
and...
and...
and
you
defined...
the
opinion
of
the
court
defined
that
to
mean
a
refusal
to
act
as...
as
being
deliberate
indifference.
mr.
w.
warren
plowden,
jr.
i
think--
mr.
w.
warren
plowden,
jr.
--if
your
honor
please,
i
think
that's
correct.
you
can
pose
a
hypothetical
question
to
the
point
that
the...
the
involvement
of
the
teacher
or
the
coach
or
whoever
it
might
be,
is
such
that
he
is...
he
or
she
has
become
complicit
or
co
conspiratory--
mr.
w.
warren
plowden,
jr.
--to
the
extent
that...
that
you
could
draw
the
conclusion
that
that
person
had
formed
an
intent
to
discriminate--
mr.
w.
warren
plowden,
jr.
--and
that's
gebser.
mr.
w.
warren
plowden,
jr.
yes.
mr.
w.
warren
plowden,
jr.
well,
if
they
beat
them
up
and
there's...
and
there's
assault--
mr.
w.
warren
plowden,
jr.
--and
that
sort
of
thing
involved,
then
there's
mandatory
reporting
laws
that
that
teacher
or
person--
mr.
w.
warren
plowden,
jr.
--yes,
sir.
mr.
w.
warren
plowden,
jr.
if
your
honor
please,
no
matter
what
the
standard,
how
high
the
test
or
where
you
set
the
bar,
once
you
have
opened
the
door
to
the
courthouse
to
these
lawsuits,
it
means
that
a
federal
district
judge
at
some...
some
stage
of
the
procedure
here,
a
motion
to
dismiss,
summary
judgment,
or...
or
perhaps
even
a
trial,
is
going
to
have
to
make
a
determination,
was
the
response
of
the
school
officials
enough.
mr.
w.
warren
plowden,
jr.
i'm
sorry.
i
didn't--
mr.
w.
warren
plowden,
jr.
--i'm
not
sure,
your
honor.
i
haven't
thought
about
that,
and
i'm
not...
to
be
perfectly
honest
with
you,
not
entirely
sure
i
understood
his
standard.
mr.
w.
warren
plowden,
jr.
we're
creating
a
higher
standard
here
to--
mr.
w.
warren
plowden,
jr.
--i
would
still
draw
the
line
at
no
sex
harassment
here
if
no...
no...
excuse
me...
no
private
right
of
action
here
if
the
predicate
conduct
is
the
student.
i
make
that
distinction,
and
i
would
suggest
to
the
court
that
there
is
a
difference
between
the
relationship
of
a
school
district
to
teachers
and
students
that
should
inform
the
rule
that
you
adopt.
mr.
w.
warren
plowden,
jr.
yes,
your
honor,
that's
what
i'm
saying.
most
of
those
racial
harassment
cases,
the
older
ones
anyway,
invariably
involve
situations
in
which
there
was
an
affirmative
injunction
in
force
to
desegregate
the
school
district
and,
as
part
of
it,
were
provisions
about
harassment.
mr.
w.
warren
plowden,
jr.
no,
ma'am.
and
i...
and
i...
you
don't
have
to
be
in
terms
of
whether
or
not
there's
going
to
be
a
damage
action
in
federal
district
court
for
this.
but
let
me
hasten
to
add
that
refusing
to
create
such
a
remedy
is
not
going
to
be
any
green
light
for
children
to
misbehave
at
will.
every
school
in
my
state
is
required
by
law...
it's
mandatory
to
have
a
school
behavior,
school
discipline
code,
and
these
are
on
file
with
the
state.
every
state
has
mandatory
reporting
of
sex
abuse
by
children
laws
and
makes
it
a
misdemeanor
to
fail
to
do
that
on
the
part
of
a
teacher.
because
of
the
educational
efforts
of
doe,
as
well
as
the
associations
that
boards
of
education
belong
to,
sex
harassment
policies
and
procedures
and
grievance
mechanisms
have
been
widely
adopted
throughout
my
state
and
throughout
the
country.
in
georgia
a
school
board
is...
is
a
local
tribunal.
it
is
set
up
under
state
law
as
a
local
tribunal
to
hear
and
decide
any
action
that
arises
under
the
school
law,
and
under
that
statute,
parents
who
are
dissatisfied
with
the
response
they
get
from
a
principal,
or
indeed
even
a
superintendent,
can
appeal
that
matter
to
the
board
of
education.
i've
had
those
cases
happen
in
my
county
where
i
live
involving
this
very
issue.
in
addition
to
those
mechanisms
that
are
within
the
school
context,
there's
the
possibility
of
a
tort
action
against
students
if...
if
it
arises
to
the
level
of
a
battery
or
an
assault.
there's
juvenile
court
if
they
are
underage,
and
for
the
students
who
have
reached
the
age
of
majority,
there's
adult
criminal
court.
all
of
these
mechanisms
are
there
to
help
the
parent
and
the
school--
mr.
w.
warren
plowden,
jr.
--not
in
my
state,
your
honor.
mr.
w.
warren
plowden,
jr.
there
is
an
extent
to
which
schools
can
assert
jurisdiction
for
misbehavior
that
occurs
off
the
school
grounds,
yes,
sir.
mr.
w.
warren
plowden,
jr.
it
has
to
relate
to
something
at
the
school.
for
example,
students
are
harassing
somebody
at
the
mall
or
the
problem
begins
at
school
and
it
ends
after
they
get
to
the
bus
stop
and
they're
on
their
way
home
from
there.
those
kinds
of
things
are
routinely
dealt
with
as
school
discipline
matters
under
these
discipline
codes
that
i
was
referring
to.
now,
that's
not
statutory
in
georgia,
but
most
districts
assert
that
right
to
do
that.
mr.
w.
warren
plowden,
jr.
yes,
sir.
in
georgia,
there's
a
body
of
law
developed
by
the
state
board.
that's
where
these
things
get
appealed,
and
they
hold
that
there
must
be
some
connection
there.
you
can't
just
willy
nilly
apply
disciplinary
action
at
school
for
totally
unrelated
activity
off
campus.
mr.
w.
warren
plowden,
jr.
it
says--
mr.
w.
warren
plowden,
jr.
--it
says--
mr.
w.
warren
plowden,
jr.
--if
your
honor
please,
it
says
that
that...
those
kinds
of
things
shall
not
happen
under
any
program
or
activity
which
receive
federal
funds,
which
is
then
further
defined
to
mean
all
of
the
operations
of
a
local
school
district.
so,
i
think
the
statute
clearly
focuses
in
the
first
clause,
if
you
will,
on
the
participant
in
the
program,
but
it
also
says
who
is
not
going
to...
who
is
going
to
be
responsible
if
any
of
these
things
occur--
mr.
w.
warren
plowden,
jr.
--i
suppose--
mr.
w.
warren
plowden,
jr.
--it
is
a
possible
reading
of
the
statute
and--
mr.
w.
warren
plowden,
jr.
--well,
the
agency
that
administers
this
statute
in
my
case
is
the
department
of
education
through
the
office
of
civil
rights.
and
long
after
this...
the
conduct
at
issue
here
and
the
lawsuit
was
filed
in...
in
fact,
it
came...
became
final
in
1997,
they
issued
some
guidance
on
this
subject.
mr.
w.
warren
plowden,
jr.
they--
mr.
w.
warren
plowden,
jr.
--they
adopt
what
i
call
the
occurs
in
theory,
which
is
a
possible...
although
not
one
we
would
urge,
but
a
possible
broad
reading
of
the
statute
to
mean,
in
effect,
anything
that
happens
anywhere
in
the
school
community
by
anybody.
mr.
w.
warren
plowden,
jr.
in
this
case
i
get
it
in
this
fashion,
your
honor.
as
the
opinion
of
the
court
says
in
gebser,
what
we're
doing
here
is
crafting
the
contours
of
an
implied
private
right
of
action.
it's
not
in
a
statute
anywhere.
it's
a
creation
of
this
court
in
the
cannon
case.
and...
and
gebser
goes
on
to
say
that
you
have
the
leeway
in...
in
fashioning
this
remedial
scheme
to
come
out
with
a
rule
that
is
consistent
with
the
purpose
of
the
statute
but
which
at
the
same
time
ensures
that
the
federal
funds
in
question
are
going
to
wind
up
going
to
support
education
programs
rather
than
being
diverted
to
support
litigation.
so,
although...
albeit
that
is
a
possible
reading,
the
occurs
in...
you
could
read
it
that
way.
we
would
strongly
urge
the
court
not
to.
you
don't
have
to
under
your
jurisprudence
as
set
out
in
gebser,
and
you
can
read
it
in
a
more
sensible
fashion
that
avoids
all
of
the
problems
that
would
arise...
will
arise
if
they
are
correct
and...
and
there
is
this
private
right
of
action
because
once...
once
you
step
over
that
line,
once
you
cross
my
bright
line
test
that
i'm
suggesting
to
you
here
today,
then
not
only
do
parents
have
all
of
the
kinds
of
formal
and
informal
adjustment
mechanisms
that
i...
that
i
described
a
while
ago,
but
now
the
door
to
the
federal
courthouse
is
open.
a
january
9
op
ed
piece
indicates
that
according
to
a
study
by
the
american
association
of
university
women,
over
three
quarters
of
all
girls
and
over
two
thirds
of
all
boys
report
being
harassed
somewhere
in
grades
8
through
11.
the
potential
here
for
litigation
is
enormous.
mr.
w.
warren
plowden,
jr.
yes.
mr.
w.
warren
plowden,
jr.
well,
i'm
not
suggesting
here
that
all
two
thirds
of
the
45
million
boys
would
have
a
claim.
i'm
just
suggesting
to
you
that
once
you
open
the
door,
two
things...
well,
three
things
really
have
occurred
here.
no
matter
where
the
bar
is,
we're
now
in
federal
court
litigating
over
the
response
of
the
school
district
to
these
reports,
after
the
fact
reports
like
you
have
in
this
case,
of
sex
harassment.
mr.
w.
warren
plowden,
jr.
i
would
respectfully
suggest,
your
honor,
that
you
could
be
talking
about
a
lot
of
money
here.
creating
this
cause
of
action
could
turn
out
to
be
self
defeating
in
terms
of
the
use
of
federal
funds
to
enhance
these
programs.
mr.
w.
warren
plowden,
jr.
exactly,
your
honor.
precisely
my
point.
what
will
happen
here
is...
and
it's
a
backward
looking
and
a
forward
looking
situation,
if
you
will.
for
the
case
that's
made
it
into
court,
the
federal
district
judge
has
got
to
deal
with
the
issue.
regardless
of
how
high
the
bar
is
set,
what
the
test
is,
there's
got
to
be
a
review
on
some
basis
looking
back
at
the
action
or
alleged
inaction,
whatever
you
call
it,
of
the
school
officials
and
response
to
the
reports
of
harassment
by
the
student.
on
a
going
forward
basis,
school
administrators,
school
board
attorneys
are
going
to
have
to
constantly
refine
and
fine
tune
the
punishment
provisions
in
their
discipline
codes
in
order
to
make
sure
that
they...
they're
protected
for
the
next
case
that
comes
along.
when
the...
when
the
district
court
somewhere
decides,
well,
this
was
not
enough,
then
we
may
need
to
adjust
our
punishment,
and
as
the
principal
in
this
case
said,
get
down
on
them
a
little
harder.
so,
you've...
you've
got
both
of
those
problems.
you've
also,
in...
in
the
course
of
doing
this,
focused
the
attention
of
the
administrators,
teachers,
school
officials
into
the
courthouse
into
the
litigation
process
and
away
from
the
school
function,
the
school
program
which,
after
all,
is
the
object
of
these
various
federal
grants
that
we're
talking
about
here.
mr.
w.
warren
plowden,
jr.
i'm
not
suggesting
so
much
that
the
difference
there
is
hard
to
apply
as
i
am
saying
that
it
has
to
be
applied
at
all
because
once
you
get
into
the
courthouse,
whatever
that
standard
might
be
that
you
would
adopt,
it's
got
to
be
applied
in
court
with
children
testifying
about
the
pervasiveness
or
lack
of
it
here
or
perhaps
even
the
welcomeness
of
it.
that's
another
concept
here
that
goes
into
this
adult
notion
of
sex
harassment
that
you'll
now
be
applying
to
the
children.
mr.
w.
warren
plowden,
jr.
under
this
scheme,
yes,
your
honor,
it
would.
i--
mr.
w.
warren
plowden,
jr.
--they
can't
benefit.
mr.
w.
warren
plowden,
jr.
not
if
the
adult
involvement
in
that
situation
in
terms
of
ignoring
it,
looking
the
other
way,
to
the
point
perhaps
of
covering
it
up,
if
you
get
to
that
stage,
then
under
those
circumstances
you...
you've
perhaps
crossed
over
my
bright
line.
mr.
w.
warren
plowden,
jr.
i
do,
your
honor.
mr.
w.
warren
plowden,
jr.
i
do,
your
honor,
and
i--
mr.
w.
warren
plowden,
jr.
--title
vi
does.
mr.
w.
warren
plowden,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
you
have
probably
inferred
a
private
right
of
action
in
guardians
if
you
put
together
all
the...
the
opinions
and
add
up
the...
the
positions
of
the
court
in
that
case.
mr.
w.
warren
plowden,
jr.
again,
your
honor--
mr.
w.
warren
plowden,
jr.
--i
would
agree
that
you
can
read
that
statute
and
the
definitions
if
you
follow
them
through
to
the
end,
that
there
is
this
occurs
in
theory
out
there.
i
would
strongly
urge
the
court
to
reject
that
reading.
you
don't
have
to
read
it
that
way.
mr.
w.
warren
plowden,
jr.
well,
the--
mr.
w.
warren
plowden,
jr.
--well,
if
your
honor
please,
jurisprudence
thus
far...
and
of
course,
you
haven't
addressed
this
issue--
mr.
w.
warren
plowden,
jr.
--you
could
perhaps
extend
the
private
right
of
action
that
far
to
reach
the
conduct
of
nonrecipients
in
your
example.
mr.
w.
warren
plowden,
jr.
not
that
i'm
aware
of,
your
honor.
we
urge
the
court
in
this
case
to
adopt
a
rule
which
is
informed
not
by
the
exception,
not
by
these
hypotheticals,
but
which
recognizes
that
a
school
district...
school
districts
in
this
country
are
making
concerted
efforts
to
deal
with
the
problem
of
student
misbehavior
whether
it
has
a
sexual
connotation
or
not
and
that
federal
funds
should
be...
should
be
used
to
support
educational
programs
rather
than
litigation.
refusing
to
adopt
the
rule
petitioner
urges
does
not
condone
that
conduct,
but
it
does
recognize
that
all
violence
and
all
harassment
from
whatever
source
and
whatever
direction
is
objectionable.
but
it
leaves
the
responsibility
of
dealing
with
that
to
parents
and
schools
operating
under
state
law.
we
urge
you
not
to
apply
a
rule
which
federalizes
school
discipline
process
by
applying
adult
concepts
to
children.
thank
you.
