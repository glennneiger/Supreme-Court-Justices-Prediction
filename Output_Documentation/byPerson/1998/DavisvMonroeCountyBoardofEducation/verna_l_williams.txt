ms.
verna
l.
williams
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
at
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
title
ix's
broad
prohibition
against
sex
discrimination
requires
schools
to
remedy
and
address
student
to
student
sexual
harassment.
the
eleventh
circuit
has
decided
that
title
ix
imposes
no
obligations
on
schools
to
remedy
this
type
of
discrimination,
no
matter
how
severe
or
pervasive
the
harassment,
no
matter
how
cognizant
school
officials
are...
are
of
it,
no
matter
how
capable
officials
were
of
remedying
the
harassment.
under
this
blanket
rule,
schools
simply
cannot
be
held
accountable
under
title
ix
either
in
court
or
in
the
administrative
enforcement
context
for...
for
refusing
to
address
this
discrimination.
this
result
cannot
be
squared
with
title
ix
and
with
this
court's
interpretations
of
the
statute.
ms.
verna
l.
williams
no,
your
honor.
the
legal
framework
that
has
developed
in
this
area
provides
standards
for
determining
what
constitutes
sexual
harassment
and
what
isn't
sexual
harassment.
ms.
verna
l.
williams
first,
i
would
recommend
looking
at
the
title
vii
standards.
the
court
said
in
gebser
that
title
vii
standards
inform
whether
sex...
sexual
harassment
is
sex
discrimination
under
title
ix.
and
under
those
standards,
a
particular
instance
isn't
sexual
harassment
unless
it
is
severe,
it's
pervasive,
unless
it
is
sufficiently...
unless
it
is
objectively
offensive
to
a
reasonable
person,
unless
it
is
offensive
to
the
person
who
has
experienced
the
sexual
harassment.
ms.
verna
l.
williams
it's
pervasive,
but
it
is
not
severe.
ms.
verna
l.
williams
but
it
doesn't
always--
ms.
verna
l.
williams
--well,
the
department
of
education
has
applied
the
title
vii
standards
and
given
consideration
as
to
how
they
would
apply
to
the
education
context.
so,
they
do
recommend
that
school
officials
use
age
appropriate
measures.
but
the
important--
ms.
verna
l.
williams
--we
understand
the
concern
and
we
think
that,
first
of
all,
the
title
vii
standards
wouldn't
apply
wholesale
in
the
education
context.
they
would
have
to...
they
would
inform
the
analysis
of
sexual
harassment
in
the
first
instance.
and
the
second
thing
is
that
title
ix
doesn't
require
schools
to
be
successful
in
addressing
student
to
student
sexual
harassment.
in
other
words,
to
avoid
being
held
out
of
compliance
with
title
ix,
the
school
would
need
to
take
reasonable
steps
to
remedy
and
address
the
sexual
harassment.
ms.
verna
l.
williams
we're
not
suggesting
that
there
are
federal
standards
for
school
behavior.
we
are
suggesting--
ms.
verna
l.
williams
--well,
we
are
talking
about
a
federal
statute,
but
the
federal
statute
imposes
the
obligation
on
educational
institutions
to
ensure
that
no
person
is
excluded
from
participation
in,
denied
the
benefits
of,
or
subjected
to
discrimination
under
the
education
program
or
activity.
ms.
verna
l.
williams
yes.
ms.
verna
l.
williams
the...
the...
the
prohibition
is
broad.
ms.
verna
l.
williams
the
parents
wouldn't
be
persons
that
are
under
control
of
the
institution.
and
so,
in
that
instance,
title
ix
wouldn't
have...
wouldn't
require
schools
to
step
in
to...
to
deal
with
that
situation.
ms.
verna
l.
williams
title
ix
doesn't
impose
an
obligation
on
the
school
to
act
in
that
instance
any
more
than
title
vii
would
require
an
institution
to
step
in
if
a
husband
didn't
want
his
wife
to
work
in
a
nontraditional
occupation
in
the
public
employment
sector.
ms.
verna
l.
williams
it
would
be
difficult
to
say
that
absolutely
everything,
and
certainly--
ms.
verna
l.
williams
--in
the
instance
that--
ms.
verna
l.
williams
--well,
in
the
student
to
student
sexual
harassment
context,
the
kind
of
conduct
that
would
be
actionable
or
the
kind
of
conduct
under
which
a
school
would
be...
be
found
out
of
compliance
is
the
type
of
conduct
that
interferes
with
the
student's
ability
to
gain
an
education
and
it...
and
otherwise
to
fulfill
the
other--
ms.
verna
l.
williams
--requirements
of
the--
ms.
verna
l.
williams
--but
the
parent
is
not
someone
that
the
school
has
ultimate
control
over.
ms.
verna
l.
williams
well,
we
would
submit
that
the...
under
the
hypothetical
under
the
situation
that
you
have
articulated,
that
title
ix
would
not
impose
an
obligation
on
schools.
and
moreover,
that's--
ms.
verna
l.
williams
--yes,
that
would
be
part
of--
ms.
verna
l.
williams
--in
the...
getting
back
to
my...
my...
i
would
like
to
modify
my
answer
to
your
question.
title
ix
doesn't
require
the
schools
to
take
any
specific
steps.
it
requires
the
schools
to
ensure
that
students
and
other
persons
are
not
subjected
to
discrimination
under
the
program
or
activity.
and
under
this
particular
hypothetical,
again
the
parents
are
not
persons
that
are
within
the
control
of
the
institution,
and
so,
as
i
said,
under--
ms.
verna
l.
williams
--no.
no,
your
honor.
ms.
verna
l.
williams
we
submit
that
gebser
rejected
holdings...
holding
schools
liable
for
the
independent
actions
of
teachers,
and
in
that
case
the
court
was
asked
to
adopt
a
theory
of
vicarious
liability
that
would
be
dependent
upon
the
agents--
ms.
verna
l.
williams
--if
a
school
district...
if
school
officials,
the
appropriate
school
officials,
had
actual
notice
of
that
type
of
misconduct
and
they
responded
to
it
with
deliberate
indifference,
they
would
be
accountable.
they
would
be
held
accountable
under
title
ix.
i
think
that
the...
the
seventh
circuit's
opinion
in
doe
v.
university
of
illinois
does
provide
a
cabining
concept
that
you
were
asking
about,
your
honor,
in
that
the
liability
would...
would
attach
to
those
situations
that
are
happening
in
school
or
in
school
activities
or
school
sponsored
activities.
and
that
would
help
to,
i
think,
address
in
part
justice
scalia's
question.
but
the
important
thing
to
remember
is
that
the
statute
does
require
that
institutions
not
subject
persons
to
discrimination,
and
the
court's
decision
in
gebser
shows
that
the
appropriate
analysis
in
large
part
is
an
examination
of
how
the
school
responded
to
the
discrimination
when
it
was
made
aware
of
it.
ms.
verna
l.
williams
yes,
it
was.
that
is
true.
but
the...
the
court's
analysis
did
not
focus
on
the
harasser's
relationship
to
the
institution
to
make
the
ultimate
determination
of
whether
damages
liability
would
attach.
ms.
verna
l.
williams
yes.
yes,
that's
exactly
right,
your
honor.
ms.
verna
l.
williams
that
in
response
to
the...
the
underlying
discriminatory
conduct
of
the
student.
ms.
verna
l.
williams
well--
ms.
verna
l.
williams
--well,
we
submit
that
that
would
be,
the...
in
the
peer
situation,
that
that
is
discrimination
under
the...
the
program
or
activity.
ms.
verna
l.
williams
any
discrimination
in
the
sexual
harassment
context,
if
the
conduct
rises
to
the
level
of
discriminatory
sexual
harassment,
the...
the
title
ix
imposes
an
obligation
on
schools
to
address
that.
ms.
verna
l.
williams
if...
remember
that
in...
in
order
to...
under
the
gebser
standard,
what
limits
the
liability
is
the
situation
in
which
the
school
has
actual
notice
of
it
and
responds
with
it
to
deliberate
indifference.
ms.
verna
l.
williams
so,
the
statute--
ms.
verna
l.
williams
--if
it
knows
about
it,
it
must
take
reasonable
steps
to
address
and
remedy.
and
as
i
emphasized
before,
the
statute
doesn't
require
schools
to
address
it
perfectly.
it
merely
requires
them
to
take
reasonable
steps
in
order
to--
ms.
verna
l.
williams
--yes.
yes,
we--
ms.
verna
l.
williams
--they
are
part
of
the
legal
wrong.
ms.
verna
l.
williams
i'm
sorry.
i'm
not
understanding
your
question.
they
don't
have
any
legal
liability.
in
other
words,
we
wouldn't
file
an--
ms.
verna
l.
williams
--right.
but
the
schools--
ms.
verna
l.
williams
--well,
the
acts...
if
the
act...
if
johnny
harasses
susie
and
john's
action
is
based
on
sex
and
it's
severe
and
it's
pervasive
and
it
is
offensive
to
mary
and
it's
offensive
to
a
reasonable
person
looking
at
the
situation
and
if
it
interferes
with
mary's
ability
to
get
an
education,
he
has
engaged
in
sexual
harassment
that
violates
the
law.
and
if
the
school
fails
to
respond
to
that,
upon
getting
notice
by
mary,
then
the
school
has
violated
title
ix
as
well.
and
in
fact,
under
the
gebser--
ms.
verna
l.
williams
--the
statute
doesn't
allow
a
plaintiff
to
go
after
that
person,
but
certainly
the
cases
that...
that
this
court
has
decided
counsel
that
we
look
at
the
underlying
discrimination
and
look
at
the...
the
actions
of
the
person
who
has...
is
alleged
to
have
done
the
harassment.
ms.
verna
l.
williams
if
in
a--
ms.
verna
l.
williams
--i
wouldn't
say
in
every
circumstance.
i
think
the
way...
in
this
hypothetical
i
would
say
the
answer
is
no,
but
if
parents,
on
the
other
hand,
were
standing
outside
of
the
doors
of
the
computer
lab
saying
that
no
female
students
shall
enter
and
they
were
doing
this
in...
in
plain
view
of
school
officials,
then
the
school
might
be
liable
for
that
because
they
would
be
denying
female
students
the
ability
to
benefit
from
the
education
program
or
activity
and,
moreover,
subjecting
them
to
discrimination.
so,
it
is
no
answer...
you're
right...
for
me
to
say
the
parents...
the
actions
of
parents
can
never
be
the
basis
of
liability
under
title
ix,
but
there
are
circumstances
in
which
they
can
be.
ms.
verna
l.
williams
yes.
ms.
verna
l.
williams
a,
you
are
correct.
we
don't
think
that
teasing,
simple
teasing,
between
students
would
constitute
sexual
harassment.
b--
ms.
verna
l.
williams
--it's
on
the
basis
of
sex
but--
ms.
verna
l.
williams
--it's
not
severe.
it's
not
pervasive.
it's
not--
ms.
verna
l.
williams
--it
can
be.
ms.
verna
l.
williams
it
wouldn't
always
be
sexual
harassment,
and
indeed
there
are
many
policies--
ms.
verna
l.
williams
--and
procedures
at
schools--
ms.
verna
l.
williams
--yes,
it
is.
well,
we
would
say,
as
a
starting
point,
the
legal
framework
that
has
developed
can
provide
a
way
of...
of
analyzing
and
articulating
what
constitutes
sexual
harassment.
ms.
verna
l.
williams
the
department
of
education
has
used
those
standards
and
has
said,
take
a
look...
use
them
in
an
age
appropriate
way.
and...
and
they
have
articulated,
for
example,
severe
to...
in
determining
whether
behavior
is
severe,
schools
should
look
at
the...
the
number
of
instances,
where
they
occurred,
who's
doing
the
harassing.
in
that
context,
there
may
be
a
difference
in
the
analysis
based
on
whether
a
teacher
is
doing
the
harassing
or
whether
it's
another
student
doing
the
harassing.
