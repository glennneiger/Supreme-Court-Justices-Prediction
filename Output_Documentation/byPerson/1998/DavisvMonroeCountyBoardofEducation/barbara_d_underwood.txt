ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
when
the
principal
of
a
school
learns
that
a
fifth
grade
girl
is
being
sexually
harassed
by
a
classmate
so
severely
that
she
can't
learn
and
the
principal
responds
with
deliberate
indifference,
the
student
is
subjected
to
discrimination
on
the
basis
of
sex
under
the
school's
educational
program.
and
if
the
school
receives
financial
assistance,
federal
financial
assistance,
it
may
be
liable
in
damages
and
equitable
relief
may
be
available
even
where
damages
are
not.
i'd
like
to
address
the
cabining
principle
question
that
has
been
on
the
table.
it
seems
to
me
the...
the
important
thing
to--
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
--the
question
of
cabining
principles.
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
cabining
principles.
unless
the
behavior
in
question
is
so
severe
as
to
exclude,
deny
benefits,
educational
benefits,
or
discriminate
under
the
education
program,
ordinary
teasing
would
not
rise
to
the
level
of
an
actionable
wrong
under
the
program.
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
well,
when
it's
sufficiently
severe
as
to
deprive
somebody
of
the
ability
to
get
an
education
and
it's
done
on
the
basis
of
sex
and
the
school
fails
to
respond
in
a
reasonable
fashion,
it
seems
to
me
that's--
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
--i
think
the
key
here
is
that
ordinarily
there...
there
will
be
deference
to
the
reasonable
judgment
of
school
officials.
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
but
there's
no
reason
why
those
discussions,
counseling
sessions,
training,
conciliation
wouldn't
be
precisely
the
sort
of
response
that
would
avoid
deliberate
indifference
and
would
avoid
liability.
that
is
to
say,
the
appropriate
response
in
the
school
setting
could
be
very
different,
would
be
very
different
from--
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
--there's
no...
there's
no
requirement
that
a
school
guarantee
that
this
not
happen.
the
rule
is
that
a
school...
for
a
school
to
subject
a
student
to
discrimination
isn't
the
same
thing
as
for
this
behavior
to
happen.
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
well,
i
think
the
principle
where
to
draw
the
line
is
in
recognizing
that
the
appropriate
response
of
the
school
is
different
from
the
appropriate
response
of
an
employer--
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
--no,
it
doesn't.
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
well,
of
course,
it's
always
possible
to
bring
a
lawsuit,
but
the
cases
that
have
developed
so
far
and
presumably,
should
this
court
adopt
this
rule,
the
courts
could
quickly
establish
what
would
be
a
basis
for
summary
judgment,
that
is,
what
sort
of
that...
that
it
would
only
be
a
failure
of...
of
the...
that
rises
to
the
level
of
deliberate
indifference
that
would
be
a
basis
for--
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
--i
don't
think
it's...
it's
true
to
the
purpose
of
the
statute.
title
ix,
like
title
vi
before
it,
was
designed
to
provide
students
with
equal
access
on
the
basis
of
sex
in
the
one
case
and
race
on
the
other
to
an
education.
title
vi,
after
all,
was
concerned,
among
other
things,
with
the
racial
hostility
of
students
to
each
other
in
newly
integrated
schools,
as
well
as
the
racial
hostility
of
teachers.
so,
when
the...
when
a
gang
prevents
a
student
from
essentially
participating
in
the
school
program
on
the
basis
of
race
or
on
the
basis
of
sex,
that's
right
at
the
heart
of
what
title
ix
means.
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
the
more
severe
it
is,
the
clearer
it
is
that
the
school
has
to
respond.
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
and
fails
to
respond
appropriately
to.
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
and
ordinarily...
as
amici
for...
for
the
schools
here
point
out,
ordinarily
schools
do
respond.
that's
the...
that's
the
other
cabining
principle
here.
presumably
it
would
be
the
unusual
case
where
a
school
was
in
fact
deliberately
indifferent,
and
you
would
have
ordinarily
to
make
that
out,
egregious
behavior
and
no
response
or...
or--
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
--it
depends
on
whether
the
school
has
failed
to
respond
reasonably
or
not.
you
don't
have
an
answer
to
the
question
on
the
basis
of
the
student's
action.
it
is,
as
i
think
gebser
said,
the
school's
response
that's
in
question
here,
and--
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
--no.
i
don't...
i
don't...
i'm
not
suggesting
that
there's
only
discrimination
if
the
student
is
demolished,
but
i
am
suggesting
that
the
student's
reaction
is
relevant
to
the
appropriate
response
on
the
part
of
the
school,
and
that
that's
where
the...
the
limitation
comes
in.
i'd
like
to
point
out
that
it's
not
unusual
in
the
law,
or
at
least
it's
not
unheard
of,
in
discrimination
law
for
the
entity
to
be
liable
for
an
act
when
the...
when
the
first
line
actor
is
not.
under
title
vii,
it
may
well
be
that
the
employer
is
liable
but
the
mid
level
supervisor
who's
doing
the
discrimination...
it's
not
clear
whether
that
supervisor
could
also
be
liable
under
title
vii
or
not.
there
are
simply
different
questions
at
stake
when
you're
asking
whether
the
individual
is
liable
and
whether
the
institution
is
liable.
one
of
the
reasons
the
individual
is
not
liable
here
is
that
the
individual...
there
are
many
reasons,
but
one
of
them
is
that
the
individual
is
a
child
and
the
idea
of
liability
on
the
part
of
that
child
brings
into
question
quite
different
considerations
from
the
liability
on
the
part
of
the
school
which
has
authority
over
the
situation
to
do
something
about
it
and
to
respond.
the--
