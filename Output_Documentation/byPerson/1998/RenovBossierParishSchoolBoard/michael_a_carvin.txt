mr.
michael
a.
carvin
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
to
answer
the
statutory
question
of
when
a
voting
change
has
a
purpose
to
abridge
voting
rights,
you
need
to
answer
the
question,
abridge
compared
to
what?
abridged
is
a
relative
term.
you
don't
know
what
an
abridged
vote
is
unless
you
know
what
an
unabridged
vote
is
and,
as
justice
scalia
pointed
out,
this
court
has
answered
that
question
repeatedly.
in
a
voting
rights
case
under
section
5,
you
compare
the
change
to
the
status
quo
ante,
and
if
the
change
is
no
worse
than
the
old
status
quo,
then
it
hasn't
abridged
the
right
to
vote.
mr.
michael
a.
carvin
abridging,
but
the
relevant
point,
i
would
submit,
justice
stevens,
is
that
they've
interpreted
the
term,
abridging,
and
all
of
those
cases
say,
if
you
maintain
the
status
quo,
you
do
not
abridge,
you
do
not
commit
the--
mr.
michael
a.
carvin
--right.
mr.
michael
a.
carvin
precisely.
mr.
michael
a.
carvin
only
in
circumstances
where
you
intended
to
make
the
status
quo
worse.
it's
stipulated
here
that
they
intended
to
maintain
the
status
quo,
and
maintaining
the
status
quo,
as
we
have
agreed,
does
not
have
the
effect
of
abridging,
so
if
you
intend
to
maintain
the
status
quo,
you
do
not
intend
to
abridge.
you
do
not
intend
to
commit
the
injury
that
is
prohibited
by
section
5.
mr.
michael
a.
carvin
no,
i'd
have
to
disagree
with
that
hypothetical
for
two
reasons.
first
of
all,
if
you're
talking
about
litigation,
of
course,
you're
not
talking
about
section
5
preclearance.
mr.
michael
a.
carvin
the
court...
okay.
mr.
michael
a.
carvin
okay,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
a.
carvin
right.
mr.
michael
a.
carvin
right,
but
if
they
had
a
law
that
said
no
one
could
vote,
that
would
violate
the
voting
rights
act
because
it
would
be
a
test
or
device,
wholly
apart
from
section
5.
it
would
also
violate
section
5,
because
it
denied
the
right
to
vote,
regardless
of
whether
abridge
means
retrogression
or
not.
but
let's
play
out
your
hypothetical.
a
mississippi
jurisdiction
has
a
law
that
says
no
one
can
vote.
all
section
5
said
under
south
carolina
v.
katzenbach
was,
look,
don't
make
your
other
voting
procedures
worse
to
replace
the
law
we
have
just
gotten
rid
of.
if
those
procedures
stay
the
same,
if
the
registration
hours
and
all
of
the
registration
qualification
stayed
the
same,
and
after
all,
they
were
designed
for
an
all-white
electorate,
then
you
haven't
filled
the
discriminatory
gap
that's
left
when
the
voting
rights
act
itself
eliminates
the
law
that
says
blacks
can't
vote,
so
that's
a
perfect
example
of
what
i'm
talking
about.
you've
got
a
law
that
says,
blacks
can't
vote.
then
the
jurisdiction
comes
along
and
says,
look,
we're
going
to
increase
filing
fees
for
candidates,
because
now
blacks
can
vote,
we
want
to
make
sure
they
don't
get
to
run
for
office.
now,
let's
assume
they
reduce
the
filing
fee,
so
it
was
retrogressive,
from
$100
to
$75,
but
the
naacp
says,
you
should
have
reduced
it
to
$50,
and
you
find
that
the
failure
to
reduce
the
filing
fee
to
$50
was
motivated
by
a
discriminatory
purpose,
what
would
you
do
under
section
5?
you
would
deny
the
reduction
of
the
filing
fee
to
$75.
you
would
put
back
in
place
the
filing
fee
of
$100,
the
fee
that
was
worse
for
black
candidates.
and
congress
understood
that
since
the
remedy
under
section
5
is
to
deny
the
change
and
restore
the
status
quo,
you
only
want
to
deny
the
change
when
it's
worse
than
the
status
quo.
you
never
want
to
deny
the
change
when
it's
better
than
the
status
quo,
i.e.,
nonretrogressive,
because
then
you'd
go
back
to
the
discriminatory
status
quo.
mr.
michael
a.
carvin
the
justice
department
has
misinterpreted
the
retrogression
standard
both
in
bossier
i
and
in
beer
and
in
this
case
as
well,
and
this
court
has
not
given
deference
to
the
justice
department's
misinterpretation
of
the
retrogression
standard
in
any
of
those
cases,
nor
should
it
in
this
one
as
well,
and
that's
because
it
does
raise
the
very
substantial
federalism
concerns
that
were
addressed
in
the
prior
argument.
mr.
michael
a.
carvin
thank
you,
your
honor.
[laughter]
mr.
michael
a.
carvin
exactly.
that
was
the
whole
point.
no
one
expected
section
5
to
undo
the
discriminatory
status
quo
in
the
south.
they
knew
they
were
dealing
with
recalcitrant
southern
jurisdictions.
section
5
is
only
triggered
if
they
change.
well,
the
last
thing
they're
going
to
do
is
change
a
discriminatory
system
and
subject
themselves
to
federal
review.
section
2
was
the
answer.
this
is
how
it
worked.
the
literacy
test--
mr.
michael
a.
carvin
--well,
but
the
only
way
you
can
get
at
a
discriminatory
status
quo.
that's
the
essential
point.
see,
if
the
status
quo
is
discriminatory,
section
5
can't
get
at
it,
because
section
5
is
triggered
only
when
there's
a
change
to
the
status
quo,
and
this
remedy
again
is
to
restore
the
status
quo,
so
if
you
have
a
discriminatory
status
quo,
section
5
is
powerless
to
change
that,
and
that's
what
congress
realized.
mr.
michael
a.
carvin
no,
i
must
respectfully
disagree,
justice
stevens.
the
only
question
in
this
case
is
whether
abridge
means
the
same
thing
in
the
same
sentence.
abridge
modifies
both
purpose
and
effect,
and
abridge
means
retrogress,
so
if
you
don't
have
a
purpose
to
retrogress,
you
do
not
have
a
purpose
to
abridge.
that
is
the
essential
thrust
of
our
statutory
argument.
if
you
are
intending
to
maintain
the
status
quo,
you
are
not
intending
to
abridge.
now,
the
appellants
argue
that
that
renders
the
purpose
prong
relatively
meaningless.
well,
it
does
have
some
meaning
in
the
richmond
annexation
context,
as
mr.
wolfson
pointed
out,
but
i
think
the
additional
point,
purpose
prong
of
section
2
and
title
7
don't
carry
much
independent
baggage.
section
2
prohibits
purposefully
discriminatory
voting
changes,
but
you
rarely
even
get
to
that
in
section
2
litigation
because
it's
got
a
broader
prohibition,
which
is
a
prohibition
on
result,
and
obviously
strict
liability
statutes
are
broader
than
one
that
requires
some
kind
of
bad
intent.
it
is
the
appellants
who
are
making
the
extraordinarily
anomalous
argument
that--
mr.
michael
a.
carvin
--right,
but
what
do
you
look
at?
do
you
look
at
whether
or
not
they
intended
to
cause
the
injury,
to
go
back
to
justice
scalia's
analogy.
if
you
have...
for
example,
under
the
law,
if
you
defame
somebody
negligently,
you
cannot
be
held
liable,
but
if
you
intentionally
defame
them,
you
can
be
held
liable,
because
we
agree
that
intentionally
inflicting
an
injury
is
worse
than
negligently
doing
so,
but
in
both
instances
you
must
defame
the
other
person.
there
must
be
a
defamatory
statement.
and
in
this
case,
there
must
be
retrogression
to
come
within
the
legally
cognizable
injury
addressed
by
section
5.
otherwise,
you
open
up
the
very
narrow
section
5
proceeding
to
encompass
all
sorts
of
the
free-floating
purpose
inquiry
that
was
referenced
before
and
dramatically
increase
the
burden
on
the
covered
jurisdiction
in
three
ways.
first
of
all,
you
subject
the
covered
jurisdiction
to
duplicative
litigation
and
inconsistent
judgments.
under
appellants'
theory
of
section
5,
the
small
louisiana
parish
comes
up
to
the
district
court
in
d.c.,
proves
itself
innocent
of
any
potential
constitutional
violation,
and
it
means
nothing,
because
the
next
day
they
can
be
sued
in
louisiana
district
court
under
section
2
and
the
fifteenth
amendment,
and
section
5
strips
them
of
any
res
judicata
defense.
well,
obviously,
when
section
5
said
you
can
have
a
follow-on
proceeding
in
the
local
district
court,
it
was
not
intending
that
you
have
precisely
the
same
trial
in
the
district
of
columbia
one
day
and
in
louisiana
the
next.
it
intended
that
the
section
5
court
would
deal
with
section
5
issues,
and
it
intended
that
the
district
court
would
deal
with
the
constitutional
issues,
the
fourteenth
and
fifteenth
amendment
violations
that
they
address
every
day.
the
second
problem
for
the
covered
jurisdictions
is,
you
create
an
insoluble
dilemma
for
them,
as
this
court
noted
in
miller
and
shaw.
if
the
covered
jurisdiction
fails
to
subordinate
traditional
districting
principles
to
create
a
majority-minority
district,
the
justice
department
will
find
that
they
have
a
"discriminatory
purpose",
as
they
did
in
this
case
because
the
parish
refused
to
violate
state
law.
on
the
other
hand,
if
they
do
subordinate
traditional
districting
principles
to
create
majority-minority
districts,
then
they
will
have
violated
the
fourteenth
amendment
under
shaw
and
the
gerrymandering
cases,
and
this
court
has
noted
that
the
jurisdictions
need
some
breathing
space
to
reconcile
the
competing
interests
under
those
two
laws.
they
need
to
have
some
ability
not
to
violate
the
voting
rights
act
and
to
comply
with
the
constitution.
i
submit
that
that
breathing
space
will
be
gone
under
this
regime.
mr.
michael
a.
carvin
well,
i
would
agree
with
half
of
what
you
said.
the--
mr.
michael
a.
carvin
--you've...
where
i
agree
with
you,
justice
souter,
is
that
you've
precisely
identified
the
dilemma
that
would
be
confronting
us
if
we
injected
these
purpose,
unconstitutional
dilution
issues
into
the
section
5
proceeding.
even
at
the
benchmark
level,
it's
tough
to
figure
out
what
is
dilutive.
as
the
court
pointed
out
in
johnson
v.
de
grandy
and
the
voinivich
case,
it's
hard
to
even
know
whether
or
not
a
black
majority
district
is
less
or
more
dilutive
than
a
45-percent,
so
you
have
to
litigate
all
of
those
issues.
you
have
to
introduce
all
of
the
section
2
evidence
that...
into
the
section
5
proceeding
to
figure
that
out.
then
you
would
have
to
get
into
the
question
of
whether
this
multimember
body
believed
that
it
was
dilutive,
and
if
they
did
believe
it,
that
they
have
a...
i
think
the
phrase
is,
verifiable
reason
for
not
doing
so.
you've
turned--
mr.
michael
a.
carvin
--well,
remember,
in
bossier
i
we
said
that
the
district
court
simply
assumed
dilutive
impact,
but
this
court
found
that
that
was
not
at
all
clear,
so
if...
now
in
future
cases
to
eliminate
the
question
of
whether
or
not
a
black
minority
district
does
have
a
dilutive
impact,
to
avoid
the
ambiguity
that
led
to
the
first
remand,
you
do
have
to
litigate
that,
and--
mr.
michael
a.
carvin
--in
this
case,
there
is
no
question
but
that
white
majority
districts
are
not
dilutive.
they
have
elected
3
blacks
out
of
12
on
the
school
board
under
white
majority
districts.
i--
mr.
michael
a.
carvin
--well,
unfortunately
the
record
closed
before
the
1998
election.
mr.
michael
a.
carvin
--so
the
court
has--
mr.
michael
a.
carvin
--no.
there
is
the
allegation
that
it's
dilutive,
and
the
board
didn't
want
to
bring
in
their
own
voting
rights
expert
to
disagree
with
that,
because
they
said,
we'll
stipulate
that
it's
dilutive,
because
we've
got
a
superb
reason
for
not
taking
the
nondilutive
plan,
which
is
it
violates--
mr.
michael
a.
carvin
--well--
mr.
michael
a.
carvin
--actually--
[laughter]
mr.
michael
a.
carvin
i
have
to
answer
that
on
three
levels,
justice
breyer.
first
of
all,
i
agree
with
you
that
the
real
problem
here
is
not
who
has
the
burden
of
persuasion.
the
real
problem
is
injecting
us
into
this
amorphous
constitutional
purpose
inquiry
in
the
narrow
section
5
proceeding.
i
think
that
generally
the
cases
in
the
2000
redistricting
cycle
are
going
to
be
close
cases,
with
very
difficult,
if
you
go
too
far,
do
you
violate
shaw,
so
maybe
the
burden
of
persuasion
will
be
outcome-determinative
in
those
cases
more
typically
than
they
would
in
other
kinds
of
circumstances,
because
we
all
recognize
that
in
redistricting
you
are
considering
race
at
some
level
of
abstraction.
whether
that's
a
discriminatory
consideration
or
not
is
a
question
that's
bedeviled
this
court
in
the
gerrymandering
cases,
and
i
think
would
bedevil
the
lower
courts
as
well.
my
third
point
is,
if
they
are
close
cases,
of
course,
that
is
the
kind
of
burden
that
you
particularly
don't
want
to
put
on
the
covered
jurisdiction,
because
if
it's
a
close
case
where
a
trial
judge
could
go
one
way
or
another,
the
justice
department
and
the
minority
plaintiffs
have
all
the
more
incentives
to
bring
the
follow-on
case
in
louisiana
that
i
described
earlier.
because
they
say,
look,
it
was
a
coin
toss,
we
might
as
well
get
a
free
second
bite
at
the
apple,
leading
to
even
more
litigation
than
you
have
typically
involved
in
redistricting
and,
of
course,
the
follow-on
lawsuit
by
the
nonminorities
in
the
jurisdiction
we
said
that
remedy
that
the
justice
department
was
trying
to
force
on
you
violated
our
rights.
so
we're
contemplating
literally
four
different
proceedings
every
time
we
want
to
get
a
voting
change
precleared.
mr.
michael
a.
carvin
again,
the
presumption
that
i'm
talking
about
comes
from
this
court's
precedent
in
will
and
gregory
v.
ashcroft,
that
if
you
are
going
to
redefine
the
traditional
balance
between
the
federal
government
and
the
states,
you
need
to
do
so
on
the
basis
of
unmistakably
clear
statutory
language
here,
we're
not
only--
mr.
michael
a.
carvin
--well,
but
of
course,
that
was
true
in
bossier
i
and
the
reasoning
in
bossier
i
was,
we're
not
going
to
add
to
the
federalism
burdens
inherent
in
the
covered
jurisdiction.
we're
not
going
to
inject
section
2
into
the
section
5
proceeding
either.
mr.
michael
a.
carvin
but--
mr.
michael
a.
carvin
--oh,
i
don't--
mr.
michael
a.
carvin
--but
if
we're
talking
about
the
1960's,
again,
we
did
not...
congress
did
not
anticipate
that
the
southern
jurisdictions
would
be
submitting
these
redistricting
plans
because
obviously
section
5
in
1965
was
only
supposed
to
exist
for
5
years.
that's
why
they
had
to
renew
it
in
1970,
so
they
didn't--
mr.
michael
a.
carvin
--well,
true
enough,
but
in
1982
when
it
was
renewed
the
court
had
just
ruled
that
the
fifteenth
amendment
doesn't
apply
to
redistricting
cases,
so
the
last
thing
congress
wanted
to
do
in
1982
was
embrace
the
fifteenth
amendment
standard
that
appellants
were
arguing
for,
because
that
would
create
the
very
real
possibility
that
section
5
wouldn't
even
reach
redistricting.
on
the
more
realistic
level--
mr.
michael
a.
carvin
--actually,
the
mobile
plurality
opinion.
mr.
michael
a.
carvin
yes,
which
it
ruled
that
the
fifteenth
amendment
only
deals
with
the--
mr.
michael
a.
carvin
--no,
i'm
sorry,
the
right
to
vote,
the
right...
that
it
only
reached
the
right
to
cast
an
individual
ballot,
that
vote
dilution
mechanisms
were
not
within
the
scope
of
the
fifteenth
amendment.
mr.
michael
a.
carvin
those
need
to
be
dealt
with
under
the
fourteenth
amendment.
mr.
michael
a.
carvin
yes.
mr.
michael
a.
carvin
and
obviously
they
didn't
change
the
language
of
section
5
to
in
any
way
undo
that
problem,
but
again,
we're
talking
about
2000,
and
i
think
that's
the
important
point
to
understand.
unlike
the
hypotheticals
that
they
keep
bringing
up
from
the
1960's,
the
status
quo
is
no
longer
discriminatory
in
1999.
we
know
that
for
three
reasons.
they
have
precleared
these
redistricting
plans
three
times.
mr.
michael
a.
carvin
no,
no,
i
think
that
the
covered
jurisdiction
has
the
burden
to
disprove
retrogression,
but
i
don't
think
if
we're
talking
about
the
reality
confronting
covered
jurisdictions--
mr.
michael
a.
carvin
--well,
actually,
no,
the
court
found
that
we're
not,
that
they
didn't
have
a
discriminatory
purpose.
mr.
michael
a.
carvin
oh,
there
may
be
nonpersuasive
evidence.
i
don't
dispute
that.
my
only
point
is
that
the
school
board's
plan
was
precleared
in
the
1980's
as
free
of
any
discriminatory
purpose
and
effect.
that
was
the--
mr.
michael
a.
carvin
--as
i
understand
it,
all
of
the
evidence
produced
by
the
black
community
was
communicated
to
the
justice
department
when
they
precleared
the
police
jury
plan
in
1991,
that
they
were
not
in
any
way
misled,
or
had
a
mistake
made,
and
i
think
the
best
evidence
of
that,
your
honor,
is
nobody's
ever
sued
the
1991
police
jury
plan.
if
it
was
such
an
obvious
violation
of
the
discriminatory
purpose
standard,
presumably
somebody
would
have
brought
a
case
against
the
identical
police
jury
plan,
but
nobody's
done
that.
mr.
michael
a.
carvin
only
if
the
people
in
those
pairs
were
going
to
run
against
each
other,
and
the
undisputed
evidence
is
that
they
were
not,
and--
mr.
michael
a.
carvin
--no,
actually,
the
evidence
in
the
record
is
that
they
knew
at
the
time
that
these
people
in
the
pairs
were
not
going
to
run
against
each
other,
but
indeed
the
school
board
was
in
a
worse
position
than
the
police
jury,
because
the
school
board
was
prohibited
by
law
from
splitting
precincts,
whereas--
mr.
michael
a.
carvin
--only
in
response
to
a
justice
department
objection,
or
where
you
did
joint
redistricting
with
the
police
jury
and
the
school
board.
the
school
board
tried
to
do
that
in
this
case
and
was
unsuccessful
in
doing
so.
there
was
no
ambiguity
under
state
law
that
says,
the
precincts
that
were
created
in
1991
must
be
the
building
blocks
for
the
school
board's
district.
they
have
tried
to
obfuscate
that
issue,
but
it
is
a
very
straightforward
violation
of
state
law,
which
gives
particular
point
to
the
point
i
was
trying
to
make
earlier,
which
is,
here,
they
failed
to
subordinate
state
law.
they
failed
to
do
something
that
was
admittedly
irrational
because
it
was
more
costly
and
created
voter
confusion,
which
was
splitting
precincts,
and
they
think
this
is
a
very
clear
case
of
discriminatory
purpose.
that
will
give
you
an
idea
of
the
dilemma
that
covered
jurisdictions
will
face
in
2000
when
they
have
to
create
yet
another
minority-majority
district
or
the
justice
department
will
say,
you
didn't
have
a
compelling
government
interest
for
not
doing
so,
ergo
you've
got
to
do
it,
which
will
lead
to
a
shaw
lawsuit
in
the
wake
of
that.
if
this
is
a
close
case,
or
if
this
is
a
clear
case
of
discriminatory
purpose,
then
no
covered
jurisdiction
can
get
through
the
justice
department
without
committing
a
shaw
violation.
mr.
michael
a.
carvin
i
think
it's
been
their
practice.
i
think...
these
are
not
regulations.
these
are
guidelines
on
how
they
will
enforce
the
law,
and--
mr.
michael
a.
carvin
--and
i
think
you
should
give
that
the
same
deference
that
was
given
to
it
in
bossier
i
and
presley,
which
is
none,
because,
as
in
bossier
i,
their
practice
is
contrary
to
both
the
beer
retrogression
principle
and
to
the
statutory
language.
i
would
also
point
out
that,
if
you
adopt
the
justice
department
position,
you
will
be
overturning
the
learned
opinion
of
the
section
5
district
court
in
the
district
of
columbia,
and
they
were
the
ones,
as
this
court
made
clear
in
city
of
port
arthur,
who
were
given
primary
responsibility
for
interpreting
a
violation
of
section
5,
so
if
there's
a
choice
between
deferring
to
the
section
5
court
and
the
justice
department,
i
think
any
chevron
deference
should
be
given
to
the
section
5
court
in
those
circumstances.
unless
there
are
further
questions,
i
have
nothing
else.
