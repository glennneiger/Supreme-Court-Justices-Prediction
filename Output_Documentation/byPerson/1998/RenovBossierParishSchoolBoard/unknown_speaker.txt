unknown
speaker
well
now,
of
course,
if
you
relied
on
section
2
instead,
and
the
government
brought
some
challenge
or
some
private
citizen,
it
would
be...
the
burden
of
proof
would
be
on
the
plaintiff,
i
suppose,
to
prove
a
discriminatory
purpose.
unknown
speaker
well,
it
would
for
all
practical
purposes
in
a
section
5
jurisdiction.
unknown
speaker
i
don't
see
that
you
ever
resort
to
it,
probably.
unknown
speaker
mr.
wolfson,
before
you
go
on
with
that,
i
just
wanted
to
make
sure
that
i
understood
you
correctly
to
say
that
section
2
often
works
when
there
is
a
dilutive
effect,
even
though
you
can't
prove
any
malevolent
purpose.
unknown
speaker
and
under
the
section
5
interpretation
that
you're
urging,
a
dilutive
effect
would
not
suffice.
unknown
speaker
you
would
have
to
have
this
malevolent
purpose,
so
that
would
leave
a
great
office
for
section
2
in
dilutive
effect
cases.
unknown
speaker
well,
mr.
wolfson,
how
far
can
congress
go
in
this
area--
unknown
speaker
--pursuant
to
the
constitution?
unknown
speaker
but
how
far
can
the
congress
go
in
directing
the
attorney
general
to
supervise
those
states
which
are
under
the
voting
rights
act,
under
preclearance
orders?
i...
the
chief
justice
can
explain
his
own
question,
but
i
was...
it
seems
to
me
that
if
you
depart
from
retrogression
as
the
baseline
that
the
attorney
general
must
follow,
then
the
attorney
general
has
vastly
greater
discretion
and
vastly
greater
responsibilities
in
preclearance
procedures,
and
that
may
put
the
constitutionality
of
the
intervention
in
state
voting
rights
acts
in
an
entirely
new
light.
unknown
speaker
that--
--if
it
meant
what
you
say
it
means.
if
it
meant
what
you
say
it
means.
if
it
doesn't
say
what
you
say
it
means,
congress
didn't
make
that
judgment,
and
in
coming
to
that
decision,
i
was
going
to
ask
you
when
you
said
this
case
involves
core
purposeful
discrimination,
well,
that
may
well
be
true,
but
in
deciding
what
the
statute
means,
what
it
means
as
applied
to
all
situations,
we
have
to
take
into
account
the
fact
that
it
would
apply
to
noncore
purposive
discrimination
as
well,
so
i
don't
think
you
can
just
dismiss
these
problems
on
the
ground,
well,
after
all,
this
is
a
particularly
bad
case.
it
may
well
be--
unknown
speaker
--but
we're
talking
about,
you
know,
how
should
you
reasonably
interpret
the
statute.
unknown
speaker
well,
you
know,
you're
talking
now
quite
properly
in
response
to
questions
about
the
substantive
extent
of
section...
but
the
preclearance
requirements
and
that
sort
of
thing
are
quite
different.
i
mean,
those
are
procedural
things
that
are
highly
unusual,
regardless
of
the
substantive
extent.
unknown
speaker
but
it's
awfully
hard
to
prove
the
absence
of
an
intent.
i
mean,
that
is
a
very
difficult
thing
for
anybody
to
do,
and
what's
the
practical
effect
of
your
interpretation?
does
it
mean
that
any
proposed
change
by
a
covered
jurisdiction
of
any
kind
is
going
to
require
that
jurisdiction
to
come
in
and
show
the
negative
somehow,
this
isn't
what
we
intended,
we
didn't
intend
to
discriminate,
or
have
a
purpose
to
do
so,
and
it
is
not
retrogressive?
unknown
speaker
i
guess
that
would
become
the
requirement
in
every
section
5
application.
unknown
speaker
is
that
right?
unknown
speaker
why?
unknown
speaker
but
i
would
think
under
your
view
that
wouldn't
be
necessary,
that
the
trial
court
could
just
discount
the
covered
jurisdiction's
proof.
if
they
have
the
burden
of
proof,
it's
very...
as
justice
o'connor
says,
it's
very,
very
difficult
to
prove
a
negative.
unknown
speaker
how
do
we
know
how
this
statute
has
been
applied
as
a
practical
matter
by
the
attorney
general
in
the
past?
i
don't...
it
isn't
clear
to
me
that
the
attorney
general
has
done
more
in
the
past
than
look
at
retrogression--
unknown
speaker
--in
most
instances.
unknown
speaker
is
that
the
statistic,
in
all
the
years
that
it's
been
in
effect,
that
the
attorney
general
has
objected
in
only
1
percent
of
the
cases?
unknown
speaker
mr.
wolfson,
i
certainly
agree
with
you
that
the
attorney
general's
regulations
couldn't
be
clearer,
when
they
say
discriminatory
purpose
or
retrogressive
effect.
that
is
absolutely
clear.
unfortunately,
that
is
not
what
the
statute
says.
the
statue
says,
whether
the
proposed
change
does
not
have
the
purpose,
and
will
not
have
the
effect
of
denying
or
abridging
the
right
to
vote
on
account
of
race
or
color,
and
we
have
clearly
held,
and
you
do
not
contest
that
the
effect
of
denying
or
abridging
the
right
to
vote
on
account
of
race
or
color
means
the
effect
of
being
retrogressive.
i
just
find
it
impossible
to
know
how
you
can
use
the
english
language
to
say
that
it
will
not
have
this
purpose
or
effect,
or
the
purpose
or
effect
of
burning
the
house
down.
burning
the
house
down
means
one
thing
with
regard
to
purpose,
and
something
else
with
regard
to
effect.
that
is
just
not...
that
language
just
cannot
be
used...
in
your
brief,
your
only
response
to
that
is
that
it
is
not
at
all
unusual
in
our
laws
for
a
purpose
to
be
treated
more
harshly
and
to
be
subjected
to
greater
sanctions
than
an
effect.
that's
certainly
true,
but
we're
not
talking
about
what's
possible
for
the
law
to
do.
we're
talking
about
just
the
plain
language.
i
don't
see
how
you
can
say
that
it
will
not
have
this
purpose
or
effect,
and
this
means
one
thing
for
purpose
and
another
for
effect.
it--
unknown
speaker
--and
the
same
for
effect.
unknown
speaker
but
we've
held
that,
and
you
don't
contest
that
holding.
unknown
speaker
that's
certainly
true,
and
therefore
congress
should
have
perhaps
written
it
differently.
unknown
speaker
it
should
have
written
it
the
way
your
attorney
general
wrote
the
regulations.
unknown
speaker
shall
not
have
a
discriminatory
purpose
or
a
retrogressive
effect.
i
don't
deny
that
makes
a
whole
lot
of
sense,
but
that
happens
not
to
be
what
the
statute
says.
unknown
speaker
i
would
like
to
ask
you,
though,
the
attorney
general
can
proceed
under
section
2
and
achieve
exactly
what
could
be
achieved
by
your
interpretation
of
section
5,
presumably.
unknown
speaker
thank
you,
mr.
wolfson.
ms.
brannan,
we'll
hear
from
you.
unknown
speaker
no,
but
there
are
two
situations,
number
1
where
you...
where
in
fact
the
jurisdiction
has
a
retrogressive
purpose,
but
the
plan
it
adopts
in
fact
doesn't
achieve
that.
that
may
be
fluky
enough,
but
the
other
situation,
it
seems
to
me,
is
quite
substantial.
it
would
not
be
necessary
for
the
attorney
general
to
show
a
retrogressive
effect
so
long
as
the
attorney
general
shows
that
the
purpose...
in
fact,
rather
the
jurisdiction
has
to
show
that
the
purpose
wasn't
retrogressive,
and
if
the
jurisdiction
cannot
show
that
the
purpose
was
not
retrogressive,
the
game's
over.
the
attorney
general
doesn't
have
to
go
into
the
further
difficulty,
or
the
d.c.
circuit...
the
district
of
columbia
court
doesn't
have
to
go
through
the
further
difficulty
of
figuring
out
whether
in
fact
the
functioning
of
the
matter
is
retrogressive.
i
think
that's
a
great
advantage.
unknown
speaker
it's
pretty
small.
i
agree
with
that.
unknown
speaker
but
that
doesn't
meet
my
point.
that
just
shows
that
it
does
not
go
as
far
as
you
would
like
it
to
go,
but
my
point
is
that
there
is
a
great
advantage
to
having
retrogressive
purpose
in
the
statute,
and
that
advantage
is,
once
you
show
a
bad
purpose,
you
don't
have
to
go
into
the
calculation
of
the
effect.
unknown
speaker
what
do
you
mean
by
verifiable,
ms.
brannan.
unknown
speaker
but--
unknown
speaker
--but
you
haven't
told
me
why
that's
verifiable,
in
your
words,
and
something
else
perhaps
is
not.
unknown
speaker
you've
never...
were
you
finished?
sorry.
i
want
you
to
finish
what--
unknown
speaker
--well,
wait,
you
say
they
have
the
burden...
just
the
burden
of
production,
or
do
they
have
the
burden
of
persuasion
as
well?
unknown
speaker
but
the
burden--
unknown
speaker
--is
it
the
case
that
your...
the
words
here
is,
if
the
evidence
is
equally
convincing.
unknown
speaker
all
right.
unknown
speaker
in
other
words,
all
this
rigmarole
that
often
accompanies
words
like
burden
of
proof
doesn't
exist
here.
all
you're
talking
about
is,
if
the
evidence
is
equally
convincing--
unknown
speaker
--a
matter
which
i
have
never
found
as
a
judge
in
15
years
in
any
case.
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
but
if
it
were
to
happen--
unknown
speaker
--then,
all
it
means
is,
if
it's
equally
convincing,
then
the
board
loses
as
opposed
to
winning.
unknown
speaker
i
guess
the
burden
of
proof
is
not
very
important
at
all,
is
it?
unknown
speaker
all
these
years
i
thought--
--often
it's
not.
i
thought
it
made
a
big
difference.
[laughter]
often
not.
unknown
speaker
well,
but
why--
--but
would
the
burden
of
production
shift?
unknown
speaker
would
the
burden
shift
to
the
government--
unknown
speaker
--once
the
jurisdiction
said,
look,
we
didn't
want
to
split
precincts.
unknown
speaker
at
that
point,
the
burden
of
production
moves
to
the
government
and
say,
that
was
pretext.
unknown
speaker
that
was
the
reason
why
they
did
it.
unknown
speaker
so
they
don't...
the
burden
of
persuasion
may
remain
constant,
but
the
burden
of
production
would
shift
once
they
come
up
with
a
good
reason
for
why
they
did
what
they
did.
unknown
speaker
so
you
have
some
statements
by
some
members
of
the
city
council
that
are
clearly
racist,
and
clearly
indicate
that
these
members
at
least
were
going
to
do
it
for
that
reason.
on
the
other
hand,
there
are
other
members
whose
statements
indicate
the
opposite.
who
knows
what
the
majority
was
on
the
city
council,
whether
the
reason...
in
that
kind
of
uncertitude,
where
you
really
don't
know
what
the
answer
is,
the
jurisdiction
loses.
unknown
speaker
and
if
you
have
to
throw
up
your
hands
at
the
end,
which
frankly
in
most
of
these
cases
i
have
to
do...
i
can't
really
tell
what
the
intent
of
the
body
was.
if
you
have
to
throw
up
your
hands,
the
jurisdiction
loses.
unknown
speaker
thank
you,
ms.
brannan.
mr.
carvin,
we'll
hear
from
you.
unknown
speaker
it
hasn't
had
the
effect
of
abridging
the
right.
unknown
speaker
you
do
have
the
effect
of
abridging.
unknown
speaker
that's
what
they
all
say,
you
don't
have
the
effect
of
abridging.
unknown
speaker
the
new
york--
--is
it
not
possible
that
you
would
not
have
the
effect
of
abridging,
but
you
would
nevertheless
have
the
intent
to
abridge?
unknown
speaker
so
if
a
county
in
mississippi
in
1966
had
never
had
one
black
voter,
never
one
in
their
history,
and
they
come
up
with
a
great
plan
under
pressure
from
the
department
and
87
lawsuits,
they
say,
i
have
an
idea,
we'll
change
it
so
now
one
black
person
votes,
one.
why
are
you
doing
it?
well,
don't
you
see,
if
we
don't
do
that...
by
the
way,
we
have
a
very
complicated
plan.
one
votes.
if
we
don't
do
that,
we'll
be
forced
to
allow
thousands
to
vote.
and
in
your
opinion,
that
evidence,
right
on
the
record,
there
would
be
no
violation
of
this
statute.
unknown
speaker
no,
i'm
talking
about--
unknown
speaker
--i
wasn't
clear,
then.
unknown
speaker
what
i
meant
was,
mississippi
has
never
allowed
a
person
to
vote.
they
now
have
a
new
plan
so
one
black
person
can
vote.
unknown
speaker
and
on
the
record,
it's
clear
the
reason
they
adopted
it
is,
they
were
afraid
that
if
they
didn't
they
would
soon
have
to
allow
thousands
to
vote.
unknown
speaker
is
that
how
the
justice
department
has
administered
this
statute
in
those
hundreds
of
cases?
unknown
speaker
let
me
just
suggest...
that's
a
great
hypothetical.
it
really
was
clever.
unknown
speaker
but
isn't
the
response
to
that,
if
the
evidence
was
all
that
clear
they'd
bring
a
section
2
case?
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
there's
nothing
in
the
statute
that
section
2
is
the
only
answer.
unknown
speaker
well,
you
say
it's
powerless.
that
depends
on
whether
one
reads
the
retrogressive
modifier
to
apply
to
the
effect
in
the
statute
or
to
apply
to
the
word
abridge,
as
you
do.
unknown
speaker
of
course,
here
the
strict
liability
only
attaches
if
the
effect
is
obvious
because
it's
retrogressive,
but
if
you
don't
have
a
retrogressive
effect,
then
you
have
to
look
further.
that's
all
that
means.
your
strict
liability
attaches
when
there
is
a
retrogressive
effect.
unknown
speaker
counsel,
as
i
understand,
part
of
your
argument
is
that,
as
a
matter
of
textual
analysis
and
as
a
matter
simply
of
common
sense
analysis,
there
would
be
something
very
strange
in
saying
that
abridgement
with
respect
to
its
effects
can
refer
only
as
this
court
has
said,
to
retrogression,
whereas
a
purpose
to
abridge
might
be
broader
to
include,
among
other
things,
dilution.
it
seems
to
me
that
in
part
of
your
argument
this
morning
you've
given
a
response
to
that,
and
i
want
to
know
whether
i've
understood
you.
you
pointed
out
that
one
of
the
difficulties
with
the
concept
of
dilution
is
that
there
really
isn't
any
benchmark
ready-made.
we
know
what
the
benchmark
is
on
retrogression
simply
by
definition.
it's
the
status
quo
you
start
from,
and
you
do
have
your
benchmark.
when
you're
talking
about
dilution,
you
don't
have
a
ready-made
bench
mark.
you
have
to,
in
effect,
choose
one
somewhere,
and
it
seems
to
me
that...
i
mean,
i
think
there's
a
lot
of
force
in
your
point
there,
but
that
also
seems
to
lead
to
this,
that
if
we
don't
know
whether
a
non...
or
if
it's
very
difficult,
conceptually,
to
decide
how
to
determine
whether
a
nonretrogressive
change
is
dilutive
or
not,
the
way
we
do
it
is
to
look
to
purpose.
was
the
purpose
in
effect
to
dilute,
to
in
effect
to
mean
that
the
vote
will
be
less
effective
than
the
vote
of
the
majority.
and
simply
because
purpose
is
so
important
in
determining
dilution,
whereas
effect
may
not,
in
fact,
be
a
basis
for
finding
dilution
at
all,
or
at
least
it
may
be
conceptually
difficult,
it
seems
to
me
that
it
makes
perfect
sense
to
say
that
a
statute
would
want
to
proscribe
an
abridgement
effect
limited
only
to
retrogression,
but
would
want
to
proscribe
an
intent
that
includes
both
retrogressive
and
dilutive.
have
i
misunderstood
your
point,
and
if
i
haven't,
is
that
suggestion
unsound?
unknown
speaker
well,
that's
a
good
start.
unknown
speaker
of
course,
that
would
be
easy
in
this
case.
it
would
be
easy
in
this
case,
because
the
witnesses
on
behalf
of
the
board,
as
i
recall,
testified
that
they
understood
that
the
police
jury
plan
was
dilutive,
so
that
would
not
be
a
difficult
hurdle
in
this
case.
unknown
speaker
but
in
this
case...
in
this
case,
it
would
be
easy.
unknown
speaker
you're
going
beyond
the
record,
as
i
understand
it.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
there
is
testimony
on
the
record,
as
i
understand
it,
that
the
police
jury
plan
is
dilutive,
and
that
the
board
knew
that.
unknown
speaker
well,
the
stipulation
that
it's
dilutive--
unknown
speaker
--is
pretty
good
evidence,
actually.
unknown
speaker
--i
was
using
stipulated
in
the
sense
that
they
assumed
it
arguendo.
they
didn't
contest
it.
but
my
point
is
that
we
are,
i
think,
structuring
a
rule
for
future
section
5
litigation,
and
every
section
5
jurisdiction,
in
light
of
what
happened
in
bossier
i,
is
going
to
litigate
that.
they
are
going
to
introduce
precisely
the
same
evidence
that
you
would
have
had
to
produce
if
you
injected
section
2
into
section
5,
so
all
of
the
federalism
concerns
that
animated
the
court
to
reject
the
injection
of
section
2
evidence
into
the
section
5
proceeding
apply
with
equal
force
here.
indeed,
congress
was
quite
clear
in
1982
in
saying
that
they
thought
constitutional
purpose
inquiries
were
more
invasive
of
state
sovereignty
than
the
result
test
under
section
2,
so
you
don't
avoid
any
of
these
federalism
problems.
what
is
your
opinion...
and
you're
free
to
sound
them.
what
is
your
opinion
on
something
i
don't
really
know
the
answer
to.
i
haven't
sat
as
a
trial
judge,
but
my
impression
is
when
a
trial
judge
sits
on
deciding
a
question
of
fact,
it's
pretty
unusual
that
the
trial
judge
thinks
the
evidence
is
really
equally
convincing.
normally,
he
thinks,
well,
you
know,
if
i'm
forced
to
choose,
i
think
the
evidence
is
a
little
more
one
way,
or
a
little
more
the
other
way,
and
i
raise
that
because
i
want
to
know
what,
in
your
opinion,
that
would
make
as
a
practical
difference
on
factual
questions
heard
by
a
trial
judge
if
you
said,
the
board
has
the
burden
of
proving
it,
or
the
other
side
has
the
burden?
unknown
speaker
may
i--
--mr.
carvin,
you
have
said
in
answer
to
justice
breyer,
and
i
think
you
said
earlier,
that
we
don't
want
to
put
such
a
difficult
burden,
particularly
in
close
cases,
on
the
covered
jurisdiction,
and
i
don't
know
why
we
should
assume
that.
i
would
have
assumed
just
the
opposite.
the
reason
section
5
was
enacted
was
that
there
was
a
game
going
on
in
the
south
in
which
every
time
there
was
an
adjudication
there
was
an
immediate
change
in
the
law
which
in
effect
put
the
jurisdiction
one
step
ahead
of
the
courts,
and
the
litigation
had
to
start
all
over
again,
and
i
would
have
supposed
that
the
very
point
of
section
5,
whether
the
issue
might
be
close
in
litigation
or
not
close
in
litigation,
was
to
put
the
burden
precisely
on
the
covered
districts,
and
i
don't
know
why
it
is
sound
for
you
to
stand
here
and
argue
that,
in
fact,
this
is
somehow
an
offense
against
federalism.
it
seems
to
me
that
it
was
precisely
what
was
intended,
and
there
was
a
justification
for
it.
unknown
speaker
and
we're
talking
about
a
voting
context
in
which,
in
fact,
the
political
and
the
constitutional
context
is
fundamentally
different
from
that
of
any
other
category
of
case,
isn't
that
true?
unknown
speaker
but
that
begs
the
question
here.
unknown
speaker
whether
we
are
adding
or
not
is,
in
fact,
the
issue
before
us.
unknown
speaker
your
argument
is,
well,
you
don't
want
to
come
out
to
the...
with
a
ruling
that
a
nonretrogressive
intent
is
covered,
because
these
can
be
very
close
cases,
and
that
somehow
would
be
offensive
to
federalism,
but
if
you
look
at
the
broader
context
in
which
section
5
was
enacted,
it
seems
to
me
that
is
probably
precisely
what
congress
intended.
unknown
speaker
but
it
has
been
renewed,
and
if
there's
supposed
to
be
a
fundamental
conceptual
difference,
i
think
it's
congress
that
ought
to
make
it.
unknown
speaker
you
say
we'd
ruled
that
section...
the
fifteenth
amendment
doesn't
apply
to
redistricting.
are
you
talking
about
rogers
v.
lodge?
unknown
speaker
mobile,
or
the
mobile--
unknown
speaker
--it
had
an
intent
element,
yes.
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
and
the
1982
amendment
was
a
response
to
that
decision.
unknown
speaker
okay.
unknown
speaker
but
we
don't
know
it
in
this
case.
there's
a
record
indication
in
this
case
that
the
so-called
police
jury
is
dilutive.
you're...
it
seems
to
me
you're
asking
us
to
start
with
an
assumption
which
is
contrary
to
the
record
in
this
case.
unknown
speaker
no,
but
you
said
a
moment
ago,
as
a
premise
for
your
argument,
that
this
is
1999
or
2000,
and
we're
not
dealing
with
discrimination
in
the
jurisdictions.
in
this
case,
we
are.
unknown
speaker
we
are
dealing
with
a
police
jury
system
as
to
which
there
is
evidence
in
the
record
that
it
was
dilutive.
unknown
speaker
wasn't
the
department
of
justice
at
that
time
ignorant
that
there
had
been
a
plan,
that
there
had
been
the
very
real
possibility
of
creating
at
least
one,
perhaps
more,
majority-minority
districts?
unknown
speaker
maybe
it
didn't
matter
as
much
for
the
police
jury
as
it
did
for
the
school
districts,
and
then
you
have
a
plan
that
has
districts
with
no
schools
in
them,
two
districts
where
incumbents
are
paired
against
each
other.
sounds
passing
strange
that
one
would
want
to
arrange
a
school
district
that
way.
unknown
speaker
but
that
decision
was
made
later.
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
they
could
get
permission
to
do
that,
and
there
had
been
permission
given
in
the
past.
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
you
one
sort
of
basic
question?
do
you
agree
with
justice
scalia's
comment
that
the
intent,
that
the
meaning
of
the
department
of
justice
regulations
that
distinguish
between
effect
and
purpose
have
been
perfectly
clear
ever
since
the
beginning?
unknown
speaker
so
we're
really
deciding
whether
or
not
the
practice
that
they've
been
following
for
35
years
may
continue
or
not.
unknown
speaker
thank
you,
mr.
carvin.
mr.
wolfson,
you
have
a
minute
remaining.
