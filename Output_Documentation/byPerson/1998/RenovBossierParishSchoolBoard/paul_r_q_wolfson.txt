mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
section
5
of
the
voting
rights
act
of
1965
prevents
a
covered
jurisdiction
from
implementing
any
new
voting
practice
that
has
the
purpose
to
discriminate
against
racial
minorities
even
if
that
purpose
is
not
retrogressive.
section
5's
purpose
prong
is
not
limited
to
an
intent
to
make
matters
worse
for
minorities,
and
section
5
also
places
the
burden
of
proof
on
the
covered
jurisdiction
to
show
that
its
new
voting
practice
does
not
have
the
purpose
to
discriminate.
the
text
and
the
court's
decisions
and
the
background
of
section
5
all
support
those
points.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
that's
correct,
but
i
think
it's
important
to
understand
section
5
does
not
render
section
2...
does
not...
useless.
i
mean,
this
is
an
issue
that's
come--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--i
don't
agree
with
that--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--i
must
disagree
with
that,
justice
o'connor.
first
of
all,
after
all,
section
5
has
been
applied
by
the
attorney
general
and
by
the
preclearance
courts
this
way
for
30
years,
not
limited
to
a
retrogressive
purpose,
and
yet
there
are
many
section
2
cases
brought
in
the
covered
jurisdictions.
this
court
has
had
several.
mobile
v.
bolden
was
a
section
2
case.
rogers
v.
lodge
was
a
section
2
case.
thornburgh
v.
gingles
was
a
section
2
case,
even
though
parts
of
north
carolina
are
covered.
there
are
at
least
two
very
important
areas
where
section
2
remains
vital.
first,
of
course,
is
where
the
challenged
practice
predates
the
voting
rights
act,
and
in
many
covered
jurisdictions
in
that
area
there
are
at-large
voting
practices
and
multimember
voting
practices
and
what-have-you
that
predate
1965.
section
2
also
remains
very
important
for
fact
patterns
like
beer
and
like
thornburgh
v.
gingles,
that
is,
where
there
was
not
a
retrogressive
effect,
and
the
evidence
does
not
indicate
anything
to
show
that
the
jurisdiction
had
a
discriminatory
purpose
but
nonetheless
the
plan
has
a
very
serious,
relatively
adverse
impact
on
minorities.
there
are
many
reported
section
2
cases
in
covered
jurisdictions
on
the
books,
and
i
think
it,
given
the
history...
this
is
not
a
new
interpretation
of
section
5
that
we
are
advancing
here.
it's
the
one
that
has
been
applied,
and
it's
consistent
with
arlington
heights.
ever
since
this
court
decided
arlington
heights
in
1976,
almost...
just
after
it
decided
beer,
the
attorney
general
has
followed
the
arlington
heights
factors
to
determine
whether
an
enactment
has
a
retro...
has
a
discriminatory
purpose.
the
preclearance
court
in
the
district
of
columbia,
as
far
as
we
know,
other
than
this
case,
has
never
limited
its
search
to
a
retrogressive
purpose.
in
addition,
there
are
at
least
two
cases
in
this
court
where
we
submit,
where
the
court
has
rendered
decisions
that
are
fundamentally
irreconcilable
with
the
construction
of
section
5
that
the
board
advances
today.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
correct.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
that's--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--that's
exactly
the
point
i
was
trying
to
make.
in
addition,
the
court's
precedents
really
foreclose
the
proposition
that
is
relied
on
today.
city
of
pleasant
grove
in
particular
is
irreconcilable
with
the
submission
that
section
5
is
limited
to
a
retrogressive
purpose,
as
opposed
to
a
discriminatory
purpose
more
broadly
conceived.
that
case
involved
an
all-white
town
that
annexed
an
all-white
enclave
and
a...
an
all-white
parcel,
rather,
and
a
vacant
parcel,
and
refused
to
annex
a
parcel
in
which
black
residents
were
living,
and
the
argument
that
was
made
by
the
city
of
pleasant
grove
in
this
case
was
exactly
the
one
that
is
made
today,
which
is,
we
know
there
is
no
retrogressive
effect,
so
the
effect
is
not
bad
under
section
5.
we
know
that
there
could
not
have
been
a
retrogressive
effect
because
the
city
officials
were
not
aware
of
any
black
residents
of
the
town
at
the
time,
so
how
can
it
possibly
be
said
that
there
is
a
discriminatory
purpose.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
well,
congress
can--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--well,
first
of
all,
mr.
chief
justice,
let
me
say
the
question
about
how
far
the
congress
can
go
beyond
the
fourteenth
and
fifteenth
amendment
really
is
not
implicated
in
this
case,
because
this
case
involves
a
core
discriminatory
purpose,
or
at
least
that
is
what
is
in
contention.
now,
whatever...
however
far
congress
can
go,
the
question
about
whether...
the
issue
about
a
core
discriminatory
purpose
against
racial
minorities
is
fundamentally
what
the
fourteenth
and
fifteenth
amendment
is
about,
so
we're
not
talking
about
going--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--well,
there's
certainly
no
question
that
section
5
is
an
an
unusual
statute,
and
it
has,
without
doubt,
federalism
costs,
as
the
court
has
said.
however,
the
court
has
three
times
examined
the
constitutionality
of
section
5
and
has
upheld
it.
many
of
these
arguments
were
the
arguments
that
were
raised
in
south
carolina
v.
katzenbach.
the
question
was
raised,
how
is
that
the
congress
can
require
the
states
to
come
to
washington
to
prove
that
the...
that
their
enactments
do
not
have
a
discriminatory
purpose,
and
the
court
said,
it
is
unusual,
but,
given
the
sensitivity
of
the
interest
that
is
at
stake,
which
is
the
right
to
vote,
and
given
the
importance
of
protecting
that
right
against
discrimination
on
the
basis
of
race,
that
this
is
an
acceptable
cost,
and
it
is
within
congress'
power
to
enact.
now,
in
south
carolina
v.
katzenbach,
there
was
certainly
no
suggestion
that
the
kind
of
purpose
that
was
at
issue
there
was
limited
to
a
retrogressive
purpose,
and
each
time
congress
has
looked
at
this
act
again,
and
it's
reenacted
it
three
times,
it
has
considered
these
constitutional
questions
very
carefully...
they
are
serious
ones...
and
it
has
said,
the
interests
at
stake
are
serious
enough
that
the
preclearance
remedy
is
still
necessary.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
well,
the--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--understood,
and
section
5
has
been
understood
to
have
two
independent
prongs
or
protections.
the
purpose
prong
addresses
those
enactments
that
violate
the
constitution
itself,
and
the
effect
prong
does
go
beyond
it,
and
it
inhibits
the
enforcement
of
those
enactments
which,
although
not
animated
by
a
discriminatory
purpose,
nonetheless
present
the
risk
of
eroding
those
gains
that
have
been
made,
and
that
was
the
issue
before
the
court
in
city
of
rome.
in
city
of
rome,
the
court
said,
section
5
has
two
functions.
one
is
to
ameliorate
discrimination,
and
the
other
is
to
prevent
against
further
erosion.
many
of
these
arguments,
many
of
these
serious
concerns
about
section
5
have
been
aired
in
city
of
rome
and
in
katzenbach,
and
there's
no
doubt,
as
i've
said,
that
section
5
is
unusual,
but...
but
the
question
about
whether
it
reaches
what
the
constitution
itself
prohibits
is
not
a
question...
it
does
not
implicate
the
concerns
about
whether
the
outer
reaches
of
section
5
might
present
some
constitutional
difficulties.
what
congress
intended
above
all
was
to
enforce
what
it
called
the
explicit
commands
of
the
fifteenth
amendment,
and
to
make
sure
that
new
enactments
did
not
violate
the
constitution,
and
that's
what
this
is
about.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
they
are
unusual,
and
they're
unusual
in
a
number
of
ways,
one
of
which
is
that
the
burden
of
proof
is
placed
on
the
covered
jurisdiction,
as
we've
argued,
to
show
that
the
enactment
does
not
have
a
discriminatory
purpose,
but
the
procedural
requirements
are
not...
they're
not...
it's
important
not
to
exaggerate
their
onerousness.
the
evidence
is
put
in,
and
the
trier
of
fact
in
the
preclearance
court
in
this
case
makes
a
judgment
as
to
whether...
as
to
where
the
risk
of
nonpersuasion
should
lie.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
right.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
well,
the
preclearance,
the
district
court
in
this
case--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--not
exactly,
which
is
to
say
that--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--which
is
to
say,
really
what
the
jurisdiction
does
is,
it
says,
here
is
our
intent.
here
is
what
we...
here
is
why
we
enacted
this
particular
legislation.
for
example,
it
could
be
that
as
in
lopez
last
term,
that
there's
a
state
policy
of
court
consolidation
because
it's
inefficient
to
have
all
of
these
various
courts,
and
so
we're
doing
this
for
efficiency
purposes.
and
that
may,
as
the
preclearance
court
said
in
this
case,
establish
its
prima
facie
reason,
a
legitimate
nondiscriminatory
reason,
and
then
it's
up
to
the
attorney
general
to
show
that
there's
some
evidence
that
cast
doubt
on
that
reasoning,
or
some
evidence
that
rebuts
it.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
well,
unless
the
covered
jurisdiction's
reason,
proffered
reason
is
totally
implausible
on
its
face,
mr.
chief
justice,
it
would
seem
to
me
that
if
they
come
forward
with
what
seems
to
be
a
facially
credible
reason,
and
it's
supported
by
some
evidence,
then...
and
the
attorney
general
simply
stands
mute,
then
perhaps
the
preclearance
court
would
enter
judgment.
i
mean,
after
all,
under
the
court's
decisions
like
st.
mary's
honor
center
v.
hicks,
it's
recognized
that
the
other
side
generally
doesn't
stand
mute
in
response
to
what
the
suggested
reason
is,
and
the
general
rules
of
summary
judgment
do
apply
to
preclearance
cases,
just
as
they
do
to
other
civil
litigation,
so--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--well--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--right.
of
course,
the
one
thing
i
can
point
to
is,
the
attorney
general's
published
regulations
on
the
matter
don't...
certainly
don't
refer
to
retrogression
as
a
purpose.
they
say,
discriminatory
purpose
and
retrogressive
effect,
and
it's
difficult
to
point
to
anything
that's
published.
but
the
attorney
general
has
reviewed
many,
many
cases,
over
300,000
submissions
in
the
entire
history
of
the
voting
rights
act.
about...
fewer
than
1
percent
of...
in
1
percent
of
the
admissions
has
an
objection
been
lodged.
the--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--3,071
times,
and
a
majority
of
those
are
purpose
cases,
and
as
far
as
we
are
able
to
tell
from
reviewing,
they
certainly
do
not
distinguish
between
discriminatory
purpose
and
retrogressive
purpose,
and
we
have
cases
like
city
of
pleasant
grove,
where
one
can
easily
look
to
it
and
say
well,
there's
no...
it
couldn't
have
been
a
retrogressive
purpose,
and
busbee
v.
smith
is
another
example.
an
objection
was
lodged
there
by
the
attorney
general.
it
went
to
the
preclearance
court,
there
was
no
retrogression
in
that
case,
but
the
process
of
redistricting
in
the
georgia
delegation
to
the
house
of
representatives
was
filled
with
racial
epithets
being
hurled,
you
know,
in
meetings
and
so
forth,
and
the
preclearance
court
said,
it's
a
discriminatory
intent.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
well,
certainly
if
one
were
to
look
at
the
language
for
the
first
time
and
see
that
it
prohibits
a
purpose
of
denying
or
abridging
the
right
to
vote
on
account
of
race,
one
would
not
find
any
language
in
there
that
would
suggest
retrogression.
i
understand
what...
i
understand
your
point,
but--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--but--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--but
the
concept
of
effect
was
construed
by
the
court
in
beer
in
light
of
the
particular
constitutional
considerations
similar
to
the
ones
that
were
discussed
earlier,
which
is...
and
concern,
uncertainty
about
how
far
congress
intended
to
go
beyond
the
core
requirements
of
the
fourteenth
and
fifteenth
amendment.
those
considerations
do
not
apply
to
the
purpose
prong.
i
mean,
to
the
contrary,
the
purpose
prong
essentially
restates
the
constitution--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--well--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--well,
those
regulations--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--well,
the
statute
has
been
construed,
of
course,
not
just
in
beer
but
in
city
of
richmond
and
in
city
of
pleasant
grove,
and
in
city
of
richmond
the
effect
was
held
good,
but
nonetheless
the
court
remanded
for
a
question
of
the
purpose
and
the
court
said,
it
may
be
asked,
how
is
it
that
the
purpose
to
accomplish
a
certain
result
may
be
bad
if
that
result
if
not
bad
under
the
effect
prong,
and
the
answer
is
that
under
our
constitution
and
the
statute...
and
the
statute...
that
a
purpose
to
discriminate
has
no
legitimacy
at
all.
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
a
section
2
suit
could
be
brought,
but
one
of
the
principal
advantages
that
congress
saw
in
section
5,
and
one
of
the
reasons
why
it
enacted
it,
was
to
prevent
the
necessity
of
the
attorney
general
going
forward
like
that.
that's
why,
as
the
court
said
in
katzenbach,
the
burden
of
time
and
inertia
was
placed
on
the
covered
jurisdictions,
and
that
was...
it
is
unquestionably
an
unusual
statute,
but
that
is...
and
one
of
the
chief
functions
of
section
5,
and
congress
has
reexamined
that
three
times,
and
each
time
ratified
that
rationale.
thank
you.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
want
to
address
a
few
points.
first,
the
filing
fees
hypothetical,
which
has
come
up
in
various
guises.
it
does
portray
a
somewhat
inaccurate
way
of
how
election
laws
operate
and
how
they
are
changed.
i
mean,
jurisdictions
don't
change
election
laws
for
fun.
they
usually
do
it
in
response
to
some
change
in
circumstance,
or
some
change
in
policy
that
requires
it.
redistricting
presents
the
most
obvious
example.
every
10
years,
most
jurisdictions
that
have
single-member
districts
are
under
a
constitutional
obligation
to
reapportion.
section
5
says
essentially
you
can
respond
to
that
constitutional
obligation
in
a
discriminatory
way,
or
you
can
respond
to
it
in
a
nondiscriminatory
way.
section
5
forces
you
to
chose
the
nondiscriminatory
way.
lopez
last
term
was
another
example.
the
state
voters
changed
the
state
constitution
to
say,
we
want
consolidated
courts.
there
are
many
ways
that
could
have
been
carried
out.
the
effect
of
section
5
is
to
say,
it
must
be
carried
out
without
discrimination,
without
discrimination
on
the
basis
of
race.
thank
you.
