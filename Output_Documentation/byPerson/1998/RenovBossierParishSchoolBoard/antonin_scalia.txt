and

versus

paris
school,
98-406.
these
cases
come
to
us
on
appeal
from
a
three
judge
panel
of
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
district
of
colombia
and
they
are
here
before
us
for
the
second
time.
bossier
parish,
louisiana
is
a
jurisdiction
covered
by
section
5
of
the
voting
rights
act
of
1965,
which
prohibits
jurisdictions
in
certain
parts
of
the
country
from
enacting
any
change
in
a
voting
procedure
without
first
obtaining
pre-clearance
from
either
the
attorney
general
or
the
district
court
for
the
district
of
columbia.
following
the
1990
census,
the
bossier
parish
school
board
sought
pre-clearance
for
a
proposed
redistricting
plan
from
the
attorney
general.
after
she
refused
to
grant
it,
the
board
turned
to
the
district
court.
section
5
authorizes
pre-clearance
of
a
proposed
voting
change
that
"does
not
have
the
purpose
and
will
not
have
the
effect
of
denying
or
abridging
the
right
to
vote
on
account
of
race
or
color."
that's
the
critical
language
here.
before
the
district
court,
the
government
conceded
that
the
board’s
plan
did
not
have
a
prohibited
effect
under
this
definition,
but
claimed
that
it
violated
section
5
because
it
was
enacted
for
a
discriminatory
purpose
namely
diluting
the
voting
strength
of
the
votes
of
black
voters.
the
district
court
granted
pre-clearance.
on
appeal
the
first
time
around
we
vacated
and
remanded
for
further
proceedings
as
to
the
board’s
purpose
in
adopting
its
plan.
on
remand,
the
district
court
again
granted
pre-clearance
concluding
that
there
was
no
evidence
of
discriminatory
but
non-retrogressive
purpose.
i
will
explain
shortly
what
a
retrogressive
purpose
consist
of.
the
district
court
left
open
the
question
whether
section
5
prohibits
pre-clearance
of
a
plan
enacted
with
a
non-retrogressive
purpose.
we
affirm.
section
5
is
an
unusual
provision.
in
that
it
places
the
burden
of
proof
on
the
party
seeking
to
avoid
a
legal
prohibition,
rather
than
on
the
party
seeking
to
assert.
that
is
to
say
the
burden
is
on
the
covered
jurisdiction
to
show
that
the
proposed
change,
the
critical
language,
does
not
have
the
purpose
and
will
not
have
the
effect
of
denying
or
abridging
the
right
to
vote
on
account
of
race
or
color.
in
a
case
called
beer
versus
united
states,
we
held
that
a
proposed
change
to
a
districting
scheme
which
allegedly
diluted
the
minority
vote,
that
has
made
it
difficult
for
the
minority
to
elect
the
candidate
of
its
choice,
could
be
denied
preclearance
under
section
5
only
if
it
was
retrogressive.
that
is
to
say
if
it
was
worse
in
so
far
as
the
minority’s
ability
to
elect
their
candidates
was
concerned
than
the
districting
scheme
already
in
effect.
we
gave
various
reasons
for
that
result
including
the
fact
that
the
consequence
of
rejecting
section
5
preclearance
is
simply
to
leave
the
preexisting
apportionment
scheme
in
place,
which
may
well
be
more
diluted
in
its
effect
than
the
new
one.
we
say
that
the
remedy
for
a
vote
dilution
simpliciter
as
opposed
to
vote
dilution
which
places
minority
voters
in
a
worst
position
than
they
currently
occupy
is
a
suit
under
section
2
of
the
voting
rights
act,
which
will
permit
the
court
not
only
to
disallow
the
new
apportionment,
but
to
invalidate
the
existing
one
but
in
which
it
will
be
the
burden
of
the
plaintiff
to
establish
the
dilution.
the
beer
case
which
i
have
just
described,
dealt
with
the
effect
prong
of
section
5.
in
the
present
case,
the
government
contends
that
in
qualifying
the
term,
‘purpose’
the
same
phrase
denying
or
abridging
the
right
to
vote
on
account
of
race
or
color
is
not
limited
to
retrogression
but
means
vote
dilution
more
generally,
so
that
a
voting
change
which
has
the
effect
of
diluting
minority
votes,
though
diluting
them
less
than
the
existing
system
would
be
entitled
to
preclearance
whereas
a
voting
change
which
has
that
very
same
purpose
would
not.
we
reject
that
contention.
the
government’s
primary
argument
is
that
subjecting
both
prongs
to
the
same
limitation
produces
a
purpose
prong
with
a
trivial
reach
covering
only
what
the
government
calls
incompetent
retrogressions.
if
this
were
true
and
if
it
were
adequate
to
justify
giving
the
very
same
words
different
meanings
when
qualifying
purpose
and
when
qualifying
effect.
there
would
be
cases
in
which
we
have
applied
such
a
construction
to
the
innumerable
statute
barring
conduct
with
a
particular
purpose
or
effect,
yet
we
are
aware
of
no
such
case.
moreover,
the
purpose
prong
has
value
and
effect
even
when
it
does
not
cover
conduct
additional
to
that
of
a
so-called
incompetent
retrogressive.
the
government
need
only
refute
a
jurisdiction's
prima
facie
showing
that
a
proposed
voting
change
does
not
have
a
retrogressive
purpose,
and
need
not
counter
the
jurisdiction's
evidence
regarding
actual
retrogressive
effect.
although
almost
identical
language
in
section
2
of
the
voting
rights
act
and
in
the
fifteenth
amendment
has
been
read
to
refer
not
only
to
retrogression
but
to
discrimination
more
generally,
giving
the
language
different
meaning
in
section
5
is
faithful
to
the
different
context
in
which
the
term
"abridging"
is
used.
we
decided
that
question
in
beer.
a
contrary
reading
would
exacerbate
the
substantial
federalism
costs
that
preclearance
already
exacts
and
would
perhaps
raise
concerns
about
section
5
constitutionality.
