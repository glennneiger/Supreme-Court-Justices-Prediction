ms.
patricia
a.
brannan
thank
you.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
if
the
goal
of
the
voting
rights
act
to
eliminate
discrimination
in
voting
is
to
be
fulfilled,
the
purpose
clause
of
section
5
should
not
be
restricted
to
a
meaning
more
narrow
than
the
basic
fundamental
constitutional
framework
for
assessing
discriminatory
intent.
if
i
might
begin
on
the
point
justice
scalia
asked
toward
the
end
of
mr.
wolfson's
argument
with
respect
to
the
plain
language
of
section
5,
there's
an
important
countervailing
principle
of
statutory
interpretation
that
would
be
violated
by
reading
effect
in
the
statute
to
mean
only
retrogression
and
purpose
to
mean
only
retrogression,
and
that
is
that
the
purpose
prong
would
become
virtually
meaningless
in
practical
impact.
the
only
voting
changes
that
would
be
reached
by
section
5
and
could
be
touched
by
section
5,
no
matter
how
outrageously
flagrant
the
racism
that
underlie
them,
would
be
retrogressive
ones.
ms.
patricia
a.
brannan
justice
scalia,
with
respect
to
that
first
category,
we
think
the
incompetent
retrogressive
category
will
indeed
be
so
small--
ms.
patricia
a.
brannan
--that
it
really
doesn't
underlie
the
congressional
purpose
in
a
meaningful
way,
and
with
respect
to
the
second,
and
a
jurisdiction
like
bossier
parish
is
a
perfect
example,
it
has
never
had
a
majority
black
election
district,
so
when
they
come
in
with
any
redistricting
plan
that
still
doesn't
have
a
majority
black
election
district,
it
by
definition
is
not
going
to
be
retrogressive,
and
for
the
attorney
general
or
a
court
to
be
looking
for
a
purpose
to
do
something
other
than
what
they've
done
we
would
submit
is
not
a
meaningful--
ms.
patricia
a.
brannan
--your
honor,
i...
we
think
that
once
there
is
a
discriminatory
purpose
in
some
kinds
of
voting
changes
it's
very
useful
to
not
go
into
the
effect,
because
some
voting
changes,
unlike
redistricting,
the
effect
analysis
is
probably
not
very
telling.
there
are
some
voting
changes
clearly
covered
by
section
5
that
don't
lend
themselves
to
numerical
analysis
like
districting
plans
do,
but
they
also
don't
lend
themselves,
we
would
submit,
to
retrogression
analysis.
for
example,
the
court
has
said
that
when
a
covered
jurisdiction
changes
its
leave
policies
for
employees
to
campaign
for
candidates
for
election,
that
must
be
precleared.
it
really
defies
understanding
to
see
how
that
could
be
retrogressive,
but
we
could
certainly
imagine
how
that
could
be
flagrantly
discriminatory
if
a
jurisdiction
always
let
employees
off
taking
leave
time
to
campaign,
but
the
first
black
candidate
appeared
on
the
scene
and
suddenly
the
leave
policy
was
cancelled,
and
people
said
you'll
never
go
out
and
campaign
for
that
guy.
i
don't
know
how
we
would
analyze
it
as
retrogressive,
but
certainly
we
could
analyze
it
as
discriminatory
under
the
arlington
heights
test.
in
essence,
the
point
we're
making
is
that
the
school
board's
test
simply
goes
too
far
toward
making
the
first
prong
of
the
arlington
heights
analysis
the
only
prong
that
will
be
analyzed
in
reasonable
common
sense
cases
that
we
can
imagine.
effect
clearly
is
one
important
indicia
of
what
the
purpose
of
an
act
or
a
governmental
actor
is.
but
in
bossier
i,
by
commending
arlington
heights
to
the
district
court
that
does
this
analysis,
we
think
that
the
court
was
saying
that
obviously
the
history,
the
contemporary
statements,
the
course
of
events
in
adopting
the
change
are
all
highly
relevant
and
telling.
they're
highly
relevant
and
telling
on
these
facts.
we
think
these
facts
are
not
only
not
unique,
but
that
there
will
be
many
voting
changes
and
have
been
many
voting
changes
considered
over
the
years
by
the
courts
that
have
a
comparable
situation.
if
i
might
turn
to
justice
o'connor's
question
about
whether
the
proof
of
the
negative,
especially
in
a
situation
where
there
isn't
objective
evidence
that
this
is
getting
worse,
is
really
an
unfair
burden
on
the
jurisdiction.
i
would
comment
to
the
court
judge
silberman's
two-page
discussion
of
this
in
the
first
panel
opinion
in
this
case.
it
appears
at
pages
104
and
105
of
the
appendix
to
the
jurisdictional
statement.
he
undertook
to
explain
in
a
very
straightforward
way
how
this
works
in
the
court
that
is
an
expert,
after
all,
in
applying
this
in
an
evidentiary
context.
judge
kessler,
the
dissenting
judge,
agreed.
her
agreement
with
this
is
on
page
116
of
the
appendix
to
the
jurisdictional
statement.
and
what
he
really
did
was,
he
harmonized
it
with
the
court's
cases
in
the
city
of
richmond.
what
the
jurisdiction
must
do
is
stand
up
and
give
a
verifiable
nonracial
reason
for
what
it
did.
after
all,
it
knows
why
it
did
what
it
did.
ms.
patricia
a.
brannan
your
honor,
if
the
jurisdiction,
for
example,
here
got
up
and
said,
we
were
trying
not
to
split
precincts,
and
here
we
have
precinct
splits,
we
were
trying
to
get
preclearance.
we
did
not
file
a
motion
for
judgment,
neither
did
the
united
states
at
the
close
of
their
evidence.
we
recognized
that
there
were
contested
facts,
and
that
that--
ms.
patricia
a.
brannan
--was
something
that
should
be
judged
on
the
facts.
ms.
patricia
a.
brannan
your
honor,
it's
simply
the
arlington
heights
test,
whether
the
facts
and
circumstances...
whether
it's
standing
up
and
saying
something
that
makes
sense.
it
said
one
thing
that
didn't
make
sense,
and
we
know
what
the
other
side
of
the
coin
looks
like.
it
said
the--
ms.
patricia
a.
brannan
--yes.
i
just
wanted
to
give
the
one
further
example
that's
actually
present
in
this
case.
the
jurisdiction
stood
up
in
the
d.c.
district
court
and
said,
we
were
trying
to
comply
with
shaw.
well,
shaw
hadn't
been
decided
by
this
court
at
the
time
that
the
school
board
acted.
we
know
that
that
isn't
a
good
reason.
if
that's
all
they
had
ever
said,
frankly
we
probably
would
have
moved
for
judgment
at
the
close
of
their
evidence.
but
what
i
want
to
be
very
clear
about
is,
we
do
not
think
the
covered
jurisdiction
has
to
stand
up
and
negate
the
arlington
heights
factors.
that
is
a
burden
of
going
forward
that
the
defendant
has,
and
that's
what
judge
silberman
said,
and
we
think
that
makes
sense.
the
proof
of
racial
intent
has
to
come
from
the
defendants
either
in
cross-examining
the
plaintiff's
case,
or
in
their
case-in-chief,
and
if
it
never
comes,
the
jurisdiction
is
entitled
to
preclear.
ms.
patricia
a.
brannan
the
burden
of
production,
and
we
think
the
risk
of
nonpersuasion
never
leaves
the
covered
jurisdiction--
ms.
patricia
a.
brannan
--in
accordance
with
this
court's
decision
in--
ms.
patricia
a.
brannan
--yes.
ms.
patricia
a.
brannan
yes.
ms.
patricia
a.
brannan
yes.
ms.
patricia
a.
brannan
yes.
ms.
patricia
a.
brannan
yes.
ms.
patricia
a.
brannan
yes.
yes,
and
we
think
this--
ms.
patricia
a.
brannan
--well--
ms.
patricia
a.
brannan
--well,
your
honor,
we
think
the
court
has
made
very
clear
in
mccain
v.
lybrand
and
georgia
v.
united
states
that
the
burden
is
there.
congress
rejected
efforts
to
shift
the
burden
of
proof
from
the
covered
jurisdiction.
ms.
patricia
a.
brannan
yes.
ms.
patricia
a.
brannan
yes.
ms.
patricia
a.
brannan
yes.
ms.
patricia
a.
brannan
that's
right.
ms.
patricia
a.
brannan
that's
exactly
right.
ms.
patricia
a.
brannan
yes.
ms.
patricia
a.
brannan
your
honor,
yes
is
the
answer,
but
the
court
wrestled
and
justice
powell's
opinion
in
arlington
heights
wrestled
with
exactly
this
issue,
how
do
you
get
at
the
intent
of
a
multimember
governmental
body,
and
what
the
court
said
is,
yes,
they'll
tell
you
what
they
said,
but
you
look
at
what
they
did.
you
look
at
what
information
they
had
in
front
of
them
when
they
made
the
decisions
that
they
made,
whether
the
public
was
participating
and
what
they
said
to
the
public
at
the
time.
that's
what
these
cases
are
made
of.
that's
what
this
trial
was
about.
ms.
patricia
a.
brannan
it
does,
your
honor,
but
again
in
arlington
heights
we
think
the
court
made
the
decision
that,
rather
than
effect
alone,
that
was
the
exercise
fact-finders
should
go
through.
