justice
john
paul
stevens
on
the
others.
most
important
mark
claimed
that
petitioner
had
instigated
the
carjacking
and
had
committed
the
homicide.
the
commonwealth
elected
to
try
petitioner
first,
when
mark
invoked
his
right
to
remain
silent
and
refused
to
take
the
stand.
the
commonwealth
sought
to
introduce
his
custodial
confession
into
evidence
against
petitioner.
petitioner
objected
on
the
ground
that
since
mark
was
refusing
to
testify,
admitting
the
confession
would
violate
his
sixth
amendment
right
to
be
confronted
with
the
witnesses
against
him.
the
trial
judge
overruled
the
objection
and
admitted
the
entire
confession.
petitioner
was
convicted
of
several
crimes
including
capital
murder
and
sentenced
to
death.
the
supreme
court
of
virginia
affirmed
the
convictions
and
the
sentence.
the
court
applied
our
long
standing
confrontation
clause
test
to
review
the
admissibility
of
mark’s
confession.
that
test
allows
the
admission
of
non-testifying
witnesses’
statements
against
criminal
defendants
when
one
of
two
circumstances
is
present.
first,
when
the
statement
at
issue
falls
within
a
firmly
rooted
exception
to
the
hearsay
rule;
or
second
when
it
bears
other
particularized
guarantees
of
trustworthiness.
when
either
one
of
these
standards
is
met
the
constitution
permits
the
admission
of
the
statement
on
the
theory
that
it
is
sufficiently
reliable,
but
denying
the
defendant
his
usual
right
to
cross-examine
the
declaring
does
not
impaired
his
ability
to
mount
a
defense.
the
supreme
court
of
virginia
concluded
that
mark’s
confession
fell
within
a
firmly
rooted
hearsay
exception
in
that
the
statements
were
against
his
penal
interest.
the
court
also
held
that
mark’s
statements
were
reliable
under
the
facts
and
circumstances
in
which
they
were
given,
because
it
is
unlikely
that
a
person
would
fabricate
a
statement
that
inculpated
himself
in
such
serious
crimes
and
because
elements
of
mark’s
statements
were
corroborated
by
other
evidence
at
trial.
our
concern
that
this
decision
represented
a
significant
departure
from
our
confrontation
clause
jurisprudence
prompted
us
to
grant
certiorari.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
we
reverse
this
judgment
and
remand
for
further
proceedings.
we
unanimously
hold
that
the
introduction
of
mark’s
confession
which
was
partly
exculpatory
and
partly
incriminating
cannot
be
supported
as
falling
within
a
firmly
rooted
hearsay
exception.
a
majority
of
the
court
for
somewhat
different
reasons
also
holds
more
categorically
that
the
admission
of
the
confession
violated
petitioner’s
sixth
amendment
right
to
confront
the
witnesses
against
him.
accordingly,
we
remand
the
case
to
the
supreme
court
of
virginia
to
determine
whether
or
not
the
error
was
harmless.
the
chief
justice
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
the
judgment
in
which
justice
o’connor
and
justice
kennedy
have
joined;
justice
scalia
and
justice
thomas
each
have
filed
opinions
concurring
in
part
and
concurring
in
the
judgment;
justice
breyer
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion.
