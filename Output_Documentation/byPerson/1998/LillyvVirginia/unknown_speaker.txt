unknown
speaker
what
if
the...
what
if
the
statement
of
the
accomplice
also
is
a
declaration
against
penal
interest?
unknown
speaker
well,
you...
you
can
say
that
about
any
number
of
well
established
hearsay
exceptions,
that
perhaps
it
would
have
been
better
if...
if
there
had
been
cross
examination,
but
those
have,
nonetheless,
been
rooted
in
the
hearsay
exception.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
you've
got
to
deal
with
not
just
the
statements
in
our
opinions
about
confessions
of
accomplices,
but
also
about
declarations
against
penal
interest.
unknown
speaker
can...
can
you
give
me
an
example
of
a
case
in
which
we
have
held
that
a
declaration
against
penal
interest
which
was
also
the
confession
of
an
accomplice...
and
that
may
be
a
fairly
narrow
class
of
cases...
was
inherently
suspect?
unknown
speaker
was
there
a
declaration
against
penal
interest
there?
unknown
speaker
which
several
of
us
joined.
unknown
speaker
so...
so,
you
think
that
our
doctrine
then
is
that
the...
if
it's
a
confession
of...
of
an
accomplice,
the...
the
declaration
against
penal
interest
is
simply
swallowed
up.
unknown
speaker
well,
it's
made
it
plain
so
far
is
admissibility
of
evidence
against
the
declarant.
the
miranda
warnings,
for
example.
i
don't
know
that
it's
said
that
custody
makes
a
great
deal
of...
of
difference
so
far
as
the...
say,
an
admission
against
penal
interest
where
the
declarant
isn't
present.
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
you,
if
you're
at
a
break
in
your
argument,
have
you
read
justice
thomas'
opinion
in
white
against
illinois?
unknown
speaker
how
would
you
apply
the
analysis
in
that
opinion
to
this
case?
unknown
speaker
but,
of
course,
this
is
not
an
affidavit.
unknown
speaker
it's
or
confessions
that
you
relying
on.
unknown
speaker
but
before
you
get
to
that,
may...
i'm
a
little
confused
about
the
declaration
against
penal
interest.
i
can
understand
it
if
the
defendant
had
been
trying
to
introduce
a
statement
that
was
made
that
was
exculpatory
vis
a
vis
the
defendant,
inculpatory
vis
a
is
the...
the
person
who
was
apprehended
with
him.
the
confrontation
clause
says
you
have
a
right
to
be
confronted
with
the
witnesses
against
you.
it
doesn't
say
anything
about
hearsay
and
exceptions,
and
the
confrontation
principle
has
been
adopted
widely
throughout
the
world
in
many
systems
where
they
never
have
a
hearsay
rule.
so,
i
don't
understand.
you
seem
to
be
conceding
that
they
go
together,
when
in
fact
the
confrontation
clause
states
a
general
principle
of
the
right
of
a
criminal
defendant,
and
that
has
been
well
accepted
throughout
the
world,
including
in
places
that
have
the
only
qualification
on...
on
evidence
coming
is
relevance.
unknown
speaker
to
some
degree
is
an
understatement.
ohio
v.
roberts
just
spells
that
out,
doesn't
it?
unknown
speaker
and
in
favor
of
admitting
evidence,
not
in
favor
of
excluding
it.
unknown
speaker
so,
i
mean,
that
tends
to
show
that
you're
going
to...
so
far
as
being
able
to
exclude
things,
you're
not
going
to
be
able
to
exclude
them
if
they're
a
recognized
hearsay
exception.
you
may
be
able
to
get
them
admitted
even
though
they're
not
a
recognized
hearsay
exception.
unknown
speaker
was...
was
this
argued
to
the
supreme
court
of
virginia
in
anything
else
other
than
firmly
rooted
hearsay
exceptions?
was
there
any
broader
principle
urged
upon
that
court?
unknown
speaker
it's
not
a
declaration
against
penal
interest.
unknown
speaker
are
you
saying
declarations
that
are
inculpatory
of
accomplices
are
by
definition
not
against
penal
interest?
unknown
speaker
of
accomplices.
unknown
speaker
mark
made
the
statement
and
it's
inculpatory
as
to
benjamin.
unknown
speaker
so,
are
you
saying
that
statements
that
are
inculpatory
of
an
accomplice
are
by
definition
not
against
penal
interest?
unknown
speaker
because
i
thought
you
would
extend
it
out
and
say,
well,
this
is
always
in
order
to
get
favorable
consideration
from
the
police.
unknown
speaker
and...
and
therefore,
it's
exculpatory
as
to
the
declarant.
unknown
speaker
you
would
say
no
portion
of...
i
mean,
suppose
the
whole
statement
contains
a
number
of
provisions
that
are
inculpatory
of...
of
the
declarant.
would
you
say
that
those
portions
that
are
not
inculpatory
cannot
come
in?
unknown
speaker
and...
and
even
statements
that,
for
example,
just
describe
the
surrounding
circumstances
of
the
crime
and
that
corroborate
perhaps
other
witnesses...
they
couldn't
come
in
simply
because
they
are
not--
unknown
speaker
--immediately
inculpatory.
unknown
speaker
why
wouldn't
that
be
against
penal
interest
if
it
should
that
he
was
there
and
that
was
one
of
the
big
issues
in
the
case?
unknown
speaker
but
you
would
agree
you
couldn't
judge
it
by
whether
there
was
other
evidence
that
the
moon
was
out
and
so
forth.
unknown
speaker
you
say
it's
an
alternative
test,
the...
the
flat
bar.
has
that
ever
been
adopted
in
any
of
our
cases?
unknown
speaker
does
the
amicus
venture
any
opinion
as
to
why
there
are
a
lot
more
declarations
against
penal
interest
in
1999
than
there
are...
were
in
1968?
unknown
speaker
so,
the...
the
position
is
not
that
people
are
making
more
declarations,
but
that
more
of
them
are
being
admitted
in
court?
unknown
speaker
which
would
authorize
it
or--
unknown
speaker
--very
well,
mr.
sacks.
ms.
baldwin,
we'll
hear
from
you.
unknown
speaker
was
the
argument
made...
was
the
argument
made
to
the
supreme
court
of
virginia
that
the
admission
was...
violated
the
federal
confrontation
clause?
unknown
speaker
well,
but
the...
the
point
i
think
is
that
the
state
supreme
court
expressly
addressed
the
confrontation
clause
question,
and
the
issue
is
whether
it
dealt
with
it
correctly
under
our
law.
and
can
we
not
address
that?
unknown
speaker
he
doesn't
have
to
make
the
same
argument.
you
don't
have
to
make
exactly
the
same
argument.
presumably
if
you
lost
below,
you'd
make
a
little...
little
different
argument,
somewhat.
[laughter]
sometimes
people
hire
better
lawyers
on
appeal
presumably
because
they'll
make
better
arguments.
i--
unknown
speaker
--well,
that's
sort
of
unfair
to
your
supreme
court,
but,
you
know--
unknown
speaker
--that
they
didn't
have
the
advantage
of
these
arguments.
but
i
don't
think
it
stops
us
from
addressing
it.
unknown
speaker
before
you
get
to
that,
i
would
like
to
be
clear
on
why
this
declarant
was
unavailable.
that
is,
you
had
two...
there
were
three
people
involved
in...
in
this
crime.
one
of
them
did
testify
in
open
court
because
his
case
had
already
been
settled.
that
was
barker.
but
mark
lilly
had
not
yet
been
tried,
and
that
was...
that
made
him
unavailable
because
he
was
going
to
plead
the
fifth.
it
was
within
the
state's
control,
was
it
not,
to
deal
with
mark
just
as
it
had
dealt
with
barker?
and
in
that
case,
then
mark
would
have
been
available.
he
would
not
have
had
access
to
the
fifth
amendment.
unknown
speaker
well,
so,
why
wouldn't
he
have
been
in
any
different
situation
than
barker?
barker
did
testify,
did
he
not?
unknown
speaker
your
answer
is
that
it
was
mark
lilly's--
unknown
speaker
--and
not
the
state's.
unknown
speaker
it
doesn't
have
to
be
a
subcategory.
i
mean,
that's
one
way
to
put
it,
but...
but
another
way
to
put
it
is
that's
simply
the
admission
of
this
testimony
comes
within
a
firmly
rooted
exception.
you
don't
just
ask
whether
in
general
there
is
an
admission
against
penal
interest,
but
whether
a
firmly
rooted
exception
against
penal
interest
would
admit
this
testimony,
this
particular
testimony.
unknown
speaker
if
you
want
to
call
that
a
subcategory,
then
i
guess
that's
okay,
but
do
you...
do
you--
unknown
speaker
--and
to
decide
whether
it
fulfills
the
requirements,
you
don't
just
proceed
with
a
general
definition,
you
know,
admission
against
interest.
you
look
to
whether
those
courts
who
have
an
admission
against
interest
general
exception
include
this
within
it.
correct?
unknown
speaker
well,
a
statement
is...
the
statements
of...
of
a
party
can
always
come
in,
and
the
ones
that
are
introduced
are
usually
adverse
because
they're
introduced
by
the
person
who
is
opposing
the
party.
a
declaration
against
penal
interest
can
come
in
against
anybody,
and
it's
a
very
narrow
exception.
unknown
speaker
may
i--
unknown
speaker
--may
i
ask
on
the
second
part,
the
otherwise
reliable
and
so
forth,
do
you
think
you
can
rely
on
evidence
extraneous
to
the
statement
itself
to
determine
reliability?
unknown
speaker
well,
didn't...
the
virginia
supreme
court
did
that,
didn't
it?
unknown
speaker
ms.
baldwin--
unknown
speaker
--ms.
baldwin,
i
understand
what
you
said
in
the
abstract,
but
i
keep
thinking
of
the...
the
statement
here
that
was
resisted
was
the
statement
that
was
highly
inculpatory
for
benjamin
and
made
things
look
better.
it
cast...
the
statement
that
was
most
damning
for
benjamin
cast
mark
in
a
better
light.
so,
i
keep
hearing
statement
against
penal
interest
and
it
seems
to
me
what
is
resisted
here
is
the
statement
that
is
very
much
in
mark's
interest
and
against
benjamin's
interest.
unknown
speaker
well,
isn't
there
something
comparative?
i
mean,
one
thing
is
to
say,
yes,
i
was
there
caught
red
handed
at
the
scene
of
the
crime,
but
i
wasn't
the
triggerman.
he
was.
unknown
speaker
but
at
the
time
the
statement
was
given,
it
was
quite
evident
i
think
that
mark
might
have
been
charged
with
being
the
trigger
or
being
directly
complicit
in
pulling
the
trigger
or
in
doing
the
killing.
and
so,
at
that
point
it
is,
it
seems
to
me,
exculpatory
of...
of
mark.
unknown
speaker
we
can
talk
about
the
burden
of
proof
later,
but
i
mean,
it's
pretty
common
sense
that
you've
got--
unknown
speaker
--a
murder
and
three
people.
the
first
man
to
say,
well,
i
didn't
do
it.
that's...
that's...
that's
seems
to
me
exculpatory.
unknown
speaker
you're
the
one...
you're
the
one
that's
introducing
the
statement.
if
you...
if
you
want
to
rely
just
on
the
other
man,
fine.
unknown
speaker
when
was...
when
was
mark
charged
or
indicted?
unknown
speaker
are
you
saying
that
at
no...
at
no
point
after
the
time
that
this
third
person,
barker,
made
his
statement,
that
at
no
point
did
the
state
consider
charging
mark
with
a
capital
offense?
unknown
speaker
and
that's...
was
there
a
finding
to
that
effect?
unknown
speaker
well,
one
statement
was
recanted.
maybe
barker
would
recant
his
statement.
from
what
statements
themselves?
from
the
statements
that
the
officers
made
to
him?
unknown
speaker
--often--
unknown
speaker
--sure,
i
mean,
but
officers
never
tell
them
things
that
are
false?
unknown
speaker
you
know,
they
say,
you
know,
you're
home
free.
just...
just
tell
us
really
who...
who
pulled
the
trigger.
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
oh,
and...
and
witnesses
always
believe
what
the
police
tell
them
when
he
says,
you
know,
you're
home
free.
just
tell
us
who
pulled
the
trigger.
you're
not...
you're
not
arguing
then
that
this
is
a
declaration
against
penal
interest.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
think
it's
very
difficult
to
make
out
the
case
that
when
he
says
that
his...
his
brother
who...
ben
was
the
triggerman,
that
that's
a
declaration
against
mark
lilly's
penal
interest.
unknown
speaker
now,
how
did
the
statement
that
his
brother
ben
pulled...
was
the
triggerman...
how
did
that
incriminate
mark?
unknown
speaker
well,
how...
how
did
that
statement
by
itself...
ben
lilly
pulled...
was
the
triggerman.
how
did
that
make
mark
lilly
an
accomplice?
unknown
speaker
but
he
had
said
other
things
that
said,
here
i
was.
yes,
the
three
of
us
were
all
in
it
together,
and...
but
then
he
said,
but
i
didn't
pull
the
trigger.
he
did.
so,
that...
i
can
see
the
rest
of
it
saying,
yes,
he
admitted
to
being
at
the
scene
of
the
crime
and
participating
in
it.
but
the
one
statement...
that
seems
to
me
you
cannot
say--
unknown
speaker
--do
the
prosecuting
attorneys
in
the
state
of
virginia...
are
they
always
bound
by
what
the
police
tell
the
suspects
when
they
charge?
unknown
speaker
of
course,
not.
unknown
speaker
ms.
baldwin,
in...
in
deciding
whether
something
is
inculpatory
or
not,
don't
you
have
to
take
into
account
what
information
the
police
already
have
and
what
information
the
declarant
knows
the
police
already
have?
i
mean,
if
he
tells
them
stuff
that
he
knows,
they
got
him
dead
to
rights
on
anyway,
i
guess
you
could
say
technically
it's
inculpatory,
but
for
purposes
of...
of...
of
this
rule
as
to
whether
it
provide
indicia
of
reliability,
it
seems
to
me
it...
it's
worthless.
just...
just
giving
the
police
something
you...
you
know
they
already
have
that
the
three
of
us
were
in
it
together,
they
knew
all
of
that
stuff.
unknown
speaker
that's
fine.
use
it
against
me.
i
know
you
have
all
that
anyway.
unknown
speaker
i
mean,
it's
not
significantly
inculpatory.
he
knew
they...
they
had
him
dead
to
rights
on
all
of
that
stuff.
the
only
thing
he
was
giving
them
that
was
new
was...
was,
you
know,
my
brother
was
the
triggerman.
unknown
speaker
all
right.
assuming
that,
you're--
unknown
speaker
--assuming
that,
you're
still
left
with
the
point
that
everything
he
said
also
formed
a
pretty
good
predicate,
if
it
was
accepted,
for
avoiding
the
possibility
of
the
death
penalty.
and
your
answer
to
that,
as
i
understand
it,
is,
well,
the
police
had
told
him
that...
that
he
wouldn't
be
charged
or
they
didn't
believe
that
he
was
the
triggerman.
well,
one
good
way
to
try
to
ensure
that
the
police
continue
to...
to
feel
that
way
is
to
make
a
statement
that
fingers
someone
else
as
the
triggerman.
and
to
that
extent,
it
is
certainly
very
much
to
his
advantage
to
say
exactly
what
he
said
about
his
brother.
unknown
speaker
and
let's
assume--
unknown
speaker
--let's
assume
that
it
is,
and
let's
assume
also
that
it
has
a
separate
function,
that
it
has
a
different
character,
and
that
different
character
is
making
certain
that
it
will
be
his
brother
and
not
himself
who
is
charged
and
convicted
of,
if
anyone
is
convicted,
of...
of...
or
sentenced
to
death.
unknown
speaker
and...
and
your
answer
to
that,
as
i
understand
it,
is,
well,
the
police
had
indicated
to
him
in
advance
that
they
did
not
understand
him
to
be
the
triggerman.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
that
is
beside
the
point.
it
is
still
in
his
interest
to
make
sure
that
someone
else
is
seen
as
the
triggerman,
and
in
that
respect
his
statement
has
an
entirely
different
function
from
its
function
against
penal
interest
with
respect
to
everything
other
than
the
death
penalty.
unknown
speaker
well,
but
i
think
when
you...
when
you
state
those
tests,
you're
getting
away
from
the
declaration
against
penal
interest,
and
saying
that
may
be
this
is
a
residual
hearsay
exception,
that
there
are
indicia
of
reliability.
but
i
don't
think
you
make
it
a
declaration
against
penal
interest.
unknown
speaker
but
i...
i
think
it's
very
difficult
just
to
see
the
statement
in
the
abstract.
a
says
b
was
the
triggerman,
that
that's
a
declaration
against
penal
interest.
now,
i
know
you
feel
differently
about
it,
but
i
have
trouble
with
that.
unknown
speaker
why...
why
wasn't
barker's
testimony
good
enough
to
put
mark
away?
unknown
speaker
well,
then
you--
unknown
speaker
--well,
you
know,
but...
but
you
say
that
mark
would
not
be
in
prison
but
for
these
statements.
that's
just
not
right.
unknown
speaker
they
had
plenty
of
evidence.
they
caught
them
at
the
scene.
barker
testified,
et
cetera.
unknown
speaker
you're
saying
the
only
reason
he's
in
jail
today
is
because
of
the
statement
he
made
to
the
officers,
and
that's
just
not
correct,
unless
i...
unless
i
misinterpreted--
unknown
speaker
--let's
conceded
that
it's
both
inculpatory
and
exculpatory.
i
still
don't
think
the
penal
interest
rule
has
been
established.
unknown
speaker
but
that
was
not
the
basis
on
which
it
came
in.
is
that
correct?
unknown
speaker
then
i
misunderstood
your...
your
answer
to
the
chief
justice.
i
thought
it
came
in...
i
thought
virginia...
the
virginia
court
sustained
its
admission
on
the
basis
of
the
firmly
established
exception.
unknown
speaker
okay.
so,
it
didn't
come
in
under
the
residual
hearsay
exception.
unknown
speaker
but
in
any
case,
it
would
not
be
open
to
us
if...
if
we
think
that...
that
it
was
not
properly
admitted
insofar
as...
as
a...
an...
a
firmly
established
exception,
it
would
not
be
open
to
us
here
to
hold
in
your
favor
on
grounds
of...
of...
its
carrying
sufficient
indicia
of...
of
reliability.
we
would
have
to
send
it
back
to
virginia
if
that
were
our
view,
wouldn't
we?
unknown
speaker
i
mean,
we
in
the
first
place
are
not
going
to
litigate
that
issue.
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
wasn't
the
reliability
established
by
virtue
of
the
statements
being
within
the
firmly
established
exception?
unknown
speaker
they
said
regardless
of
the
penal
interest
exception,
this
is
reliable,
independently
reliable
regardless
of
the
penal
interest
exception.
is
that
what
they
said?
unknown
speaker
that's
what
i
thought.
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
on
that
question,
in
your
view,
to
decide
whether
an
exception
is
firmly
rooted,
is
it
sufficient
that
it's
firmly
rooted
in
virginia?
unknown
speaker
you
don't
take
that
position.
unknown
speaker
all
right.
so,
you
have
to
look
at
what
happened
in
other
states.
unknown
speaker
and
if
you've
surveyed
the
states
and
you
find
that
a...
a
given
state,
a
hypothetical
state,
that
says,
yes,
we
have
a...
a
declaration
against
penal
interest
exception
to
the
hearsay
rule,
however
that
does
not
encompass
declarations
when
they
are
by
an
accomplice
against
a
third
party,
which
side
of
the
line
would
we
count
that
state,
as
supporting
a
firmly
rooted
or
as
not
supporting
a
firmly
rooted?
unknown
speaker
well,
i'd
like
to
keep
it
categorical
for
the
purpose
of
my
question.
unknown
speaker
and
if
you
had
a
category
in
a
given
state
the
totally
excluded
accomplice
statements
even
though
they
were
self
incriminating,
you
would
say
that
should
not
count.
unknown
speaker
i
understand.
unknown
speaker
but
there's
a
debate
between
the
two
of
you
on
the
extent
to
which
there
are
those
states--
unknown
speaker
--so,
that's
a
question
we
really
have
to
research
the
state
laws
at
some
depth.
unknown
speaker
i'm
staying
away
from
the
reliability
inquiry
and
looking
at
the
cases
that
they
tied
to
subcategorize
in
their
reply
brief.
unknown
speaker
ms.
baldwin,
the
constitution
does
says
something
about
the
right
to
be
confronted
with
the
witnesses
against
him.
and
mr.
sacks
emphasized
that
whether
we
talk
about
a
hearsay
rule,
the
main
thing
is
would
cross
examination
be
of
marginal
utility.
would
you
agree
that
that's
really
the
underlying
theme
here
that
you...
you
say,
well,
you
don't
need
to
have
the
witness
if
cross
examination
would
be
of
marginal
utility?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
i
think
you've
answered
the
question.
unknown
speaker
mr.
sacks,
you
have
3
minutes
remaining.
unknown
speaker
the
honorable
court
is
now
adjourned
until
tomorrow
at
ten
o'clock.
