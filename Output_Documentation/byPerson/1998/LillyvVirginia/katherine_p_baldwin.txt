ms.
katherine
p.
baldwin
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
my
procedural
argument
has
not
been
argued
this
morning,
and...
and
i
will
not
belabor
it,
but
i
do
want
to
make
the
point
that
benjamin
lilly
is
asking
this
court...
it
is
our
position,
is
asking
this
court
to
reverse
his
conviction
on
the
basis
of
arguments
that
were
not
presented
to
the
virginia
supreme
court
in
a
timely
manner.
for
the
first
time
in
a
petition
for
rehearing
below
was
where
there
was
any
argument
that
there
was
a
per
se
rule,
that
the
confrontation
clause
did
not
allow
these
types
of
confessions,
although
i
understand
it
sounds
this
morning
as
though
the
petitioner
is
backing
away
from
that
argument
of
it
being
a
per
se
rule.
and
he
certainly
never
made
the
argument,
until
his
petition
for
rehearing,
about
the
nature
of
his
particular
case
involving
a
co
defendant's
confession
being
some
subcategory
of...
of
the
exception
which
is
not
firmly
rooted.
ms.
katherine
p.
baldwin
yes,
mr.
chief
justice.
he
definitely
argued
and
cited
to
the
sixth
amendment
confrontation
clause
all
the
way
through,
but
it
was
always
secondarily.
it
was
mainly
a
state
evidentiary
matter
that
was
being
argued,
and
when
he
cited
the
confrontation
clause--
ms.
katherine
p.
baldwin
--justice
o'connor,
i
do
not
believe
it's
the
same
argument
that
was
made
below.
ms.
katherine
p.
baldwin
our
only
point
on
this
issue
is
that
i
think
it's
unfair
to
reverse
a
conviction
and
a
judgment
of
the
virginia
supreme
court
on
bases
that
literally
were
not
argued
or
addressed
by
the
court.
they
did
argue...
there's
no
question.
they
did
argue
and
the
court
did
address
in
a
broad
sense
the
confrontation
clause,
but
it
was
a
general
argument
that
i
did
not
get
to
cross
examine
mark
lilly,
therefore
the
confrontation
clause
was
violated.
and
none
of
these--
ms.
katherine
p.
baldwin
--i...
i--
ms.
katherine
p.
baldwin
--i
understand,
justice
scalia,
and...
and
i
will
definitely
move
on.
regarding
the
firmly
rooted
issues
in
this
case--
ms.
katherine
p.
baldwin
--well,
justice
ginsburg,
i
have
two
answers
to
that.
first
of
all,
benjamin
lilly
conceded
below
that
mark
lilly
was
unavailable.
so,
that
was
not
an
issue
that
the
petitioner
has
ever
brought
up
or
challenged
in
any
way
until
some
of
the
briefs
that
have
been
filed
in
this
court.
but
his
unavailability
was
conceded
below.
secondly,
the
timing
or
the...
the...
or
mark
lilly
being
able
to
testify
or
not
or
take
the
fifth
amendment
or
not
was
not
in
the
state's
control.
mark
lilly
was
the
one
who
decided
to
take
the
fifth
amendment.
the
arguments
that
have
been
made
for
the
first
time
on
brief
are
essentially
that
the...
that
the
state
could
have
tried
him
first,
which
they
could
have,
but
that
would
have
not
taken
away
his
fifth
amendment
right
not
to
testify
in
virginia.
and...
and...
especially
through
direct
appeal.
ms.
katherine
p.
baldwin
barker
made
a
deal
with
the
commonwealth
in
return
for
his
truthful
testimony.
that's
correct.
he
pled
guilty
and
he
made
a
deal.
but
mark
lilly
was
unwilling
to
make
any
kind
of
plea
agreement
with
the
commonwealth.
that
was
in
mark
lilly's
complete
ability
to
do
that
or
not.
that
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
state
controlling
it.
in
fact,
i
mean,
mark
lilly
obviously
was
unwilling
to
testify
against
his
brother.
in
fact,
he
testified
post
verdict
to
what
was
pretty
obviously
perjured
testimony
in
favor
of
his
brother.
so...
so,
there
was...
the
state
was
caught
in
this
case.
it
had
an
accomplice
who
had
given
a
confession,
and
the
accomplice
decided
not
to
take
the...
not
to
testify
against
his
brother.
and
in
virginia,
that
clearly
makes
him
unavailable
and
under
federal
law
that...
for
the
federal
law
for
the
same
hearsay
exception
it
makes
him
unavailable.
there...
there's
no...
there's
been
some
argument
that
the
commonwealth
could
have
extended
some
kind
of
immunity
to
him.
well,
in
virginia,
there
is
no
way
to
force
a...
a
witness
to
testify
under
these
circumstances--
ms.
katherine
p.
baldwin
--it
was
his
decision.
it
had--
ms.
katherine
p.
baldwin
--it
was
not
within
the
control
of...
of
the
commonwealth
of
virginia.
he
took
himself
out
of
the
trial,
and...
and...
and
the
commonwealth
would
have
liked
to
have
had
his
testimony,
but
it
did
not.
back
to
the
firmly
rooted
nature
of
this...
of
the
hearsay
exception,
this
court
has
never
found
some
type
of
subcategory
that's
being
argued
now
of
the
statements
against
penal
interest.
ms.
katherine
p.
baldwin
well,
and
i
think
another
way--
ms.
katherine
p.
baldwin
--i
don't
disagree
with
the
statement
of
the
question,
justice
scalia.
another
way
maybe
of
putting
it,
which
i
think
is...
is
the
issue,
is
does
this
particular
evidence
in
this
case,
the
confession,
meet
the
requirements
of
this...
of
this
established
hearsay
exception.
if
it
meets
it,
if
a
trial
court
judge
decides
like
he
decides
any
other
piece
of
evidence,
whether
it's
reliable
or
not,
does
it
fulfill
the
requirements,
then
it
comes
in
the...
into
evidence.
ms.
katherine
p.
baldwin
well,
that's
correct,
but
also
i
think
we
have
to
know
what
we're
talking
about
here.
statements
against
penal
interest
i
think
can...
is
capable
of
having
two
different
meanings,
and
i
think
those
have
gotten
fudged
in
the
petitioner's
argument.
statement
against
penal
interest
is
a
term
of
art.
it
also
might
have
a...
a
layman's
sense
that
anytime
somebody
says
something
which
on
the
surface
looks
like
it's
against
their
interest.
we're
not
arguing
and
have
never
argued...
and
in
virginia,
that
doesn't
come
in
under
a
statement...
statement
against
penal
interest.
it
has
to
be--
ms.
katherine
p.
baldwin
--it
is
a
very
narrow
exception,
mr.
chief
justice.
there's
no
question
about
it.
and
not
a
lot
of
evidence
qualifies
under
it.
and
probably
not
a
lot
of
accomplice
confessions
qualify
under
it.
in
fact,
the
commonwealth
of
virginia
has...
has
never
argued
and...
and
i'm
not
arguing
today.
we
don't
need
this
court
to
find
this
is
a
firmly
rooted
exception.
there's
nothing
magic
about
that
as
far
as
governing
the
issue
in
this
case.
this
is
an
evidentiary
matter.
did
it
violate
the
confrontation
clause?
and
this
court
has
made
very
clear
two
things,
that
such...
such
evidence
can
come
in
under
exceptions
to
the
hearsay
rule
and
not
violate
the
confrontation
clause
if
it's
either
firmly
rooted
or
if
it
otherwise
has
some
indicia
of
reliability
associated
with
it.
and...
and
in
virginia,
that
is
what
is
looked
at
in
every
single
case.
so,
we
don't
need
this
court
to
rule
that
it's
firmly
rooted.
ms.
katherine
p.
baldwin
i
don't
think
there's
any
question
but--
ms.
katherine
p.
baldwin
--i
think
that
there's
nothing
to
prevent
a
court
from
doing
that,
justice
stevens,
but
i
don't
think
that...
that
in
this
case,
for
instance,
that
that's
what
was
done.
and
i
think
it's
the
nature
of
the--
ms.
katherine
p.
baldwin
--i
don't
believe
they
do
if
you
look
at
how...
how
this
particular
hearsay
exception
works
and
what
the
virginia...
virginia
supreme
court
has
always
required.
first
of
all,
it's...
it's
a
two
step
hurdle
that
it...
that
the
evidence
has
to
pass
before
it
comes
in.
it's
got
to
meet
the
general
common
law
hearsay
exception,
but
that
hearsay
exception
itself
requires
that
you
look
at
the
circumstances
of
the
statement
because
it
has
to
be
a
statement
that
is,
yes,
on
its
surface
against
his
interest.
he
has
to
know
it's
against
his
interest.
it
has
to
be
genuinely
self
inculpatory.
so,
once
you
pass
that
hurdle,
my
argument
is
that
meets
the
corroboration
rule
even
of
idaho
v.
wright,
even
though
i
don't
think
there's
any
requirement
that
that
applies
to
anything
except
the
type
of
residual
hearsay
exceptions
that
don't
have
their
own
indicia
of
reliability
with
them.
statements
against
penal
interest
do,
and
this
is
a
separate
argument
from
whether
it's
firmly
rooted
or
not--
ms.
katherine
p.
baldwin
--whether
it's
widely
accepted--
ms.
katherine
p.
baldwin
--i
don't
believe
that
any
statement
that
mark
lilly
made
in
these
confessions
were
in
any
way
exculpatory
of
mark
lilly,
and
that
includes
everything
he
said
about
his
brother.
you
have
to--
ms.
katherine
p.
baldwin
--the
only
issue
in
this
case...
and
i
think
this
is
a
significant
factor
for
this
case,
and
i
think
it
completely
distinguishes
it
from
lee
v.
illinois
and
any
of
the
other
cases
that
have
found...
that
have
found
this
type
of
evidence
inadmissible
in
those
particular
cases...
and
that
is
that
the
only
issue
in
this
case...
the
only
issue...
was
who
pulled
the
trigger.
there
were
no
other
issues
in
the
case.
ms.
katherine
p.
baldwin
justice
kennedy,
i
disagree.
i
don't
think
the
record
proves
that
point
which
i
know
is
what
the
petitioner
has
argued.
ms.
katherine
p.
baldwin
no,
i
don't--
ms.
katherine
p.
baldwin
--but
by
the
time
mark
lilly
was
interviewed,
gary
barker
had
already
confessed,
had
already
interviewed.
the
police
knew
what
had
happened.
and
the
most
important
thing
is
that
they
came
to
mark
lilly
and
they
said,
no
one
is--
ms.
katherine
p.
baldwin
--maybe,
justice
kennedy,
i
didn't
understand
your
question,
but...
but
i
think
it's
significant
here
that
mark
lilly
was
never
suspected
never
suspected...
of
being
the
triggerman
and
he
was
told
that
by
the
police
officer
who
was...
who
was
interviewing
him.
and
so,
the
only
issue
in
the
case
then...
if
the
only
issue
in
the
case
is
who
pulled
the
trigger,
mark
lilly
by
definition
was
not
trying--
ms.
katherine
p.
baldwin
--they
were...
i'm
not
sure
of
the
exact
date,
but
they
were
all
charged--
ms.
katherine
p.
baldwin
--that's
correct.
ms.
katherine
p.
baldwin
no,
your
honor.
the...
we
have
that
from
the
statements
themselves,
and
there
is...
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
anywhere--
ms.
katherine
p.
baldwin
--yes,
from...
from
the
record
of...
of--
ms.
katherine
p.
baldwin
--of
the
confession.
ms.
katherine
p.
baldwin
well,
but
i
don't...
i
don't
think
in...
for...
for
the--
ms.
katherine
p.
baldwin
--but,
justice
scalia,
for
the
point
that
we're
arguing,
it
wouldn't
matter
whether
the
police
were
lying
or
not
because
the
point
we're
trying
to
look
at
now
is
what
was
mark
lilly
thinking
when
he
made
these
statements.
ms.
katherine
p.
baldwin
mark
lilly's
statements
were
a
declaration
against
penal
interest.
ms.
katherine
p.
baldwin
it's
what
caused
mark
lilly
to
be
indicted,
tried,
and
convicted
of
first
degree
murder.
he
was
not...
this
is
not
a...
a
bystander
watching
something
down
the
road
occur.
this
is
an
active
participant
witness
accomplice
who
tells
the
police
information,
and
every
piece
of
information
is...
and
it's
crucial,
what
his
brother
did,
the
shooter...
made
mark
lilly
guilty
of
the
crimes
that
he
is
in
prison
for
now.
ms.
katherine
p.
baldwin
it
made
him
an
accomplice
to
first
degree
murder
which
in
virginia
he
is
punished
as
a
principal
in
the
first
degree
except
for
capital
murder.
he
cannot
receive
the
death
penalty,
but
he
receives...
he
can
receive
up
to
a
life
sentence
for
first
degree
murder.
ms.
katherine
p.
baldwin
it
established
the
murder.
it
established
a...
a
premeditated
murder
to
which
mark
lilly
was
the
accomplice.
it
absolutely
was
crucial
to...
to
be...
as
far
as
being
inculpatory
as
to
mark.
without
that--
ms.
katherine
p.
baldwin
--but...
but
mark
lilly...
and
i
have
to
go
back
to
this.
there's
nothing
in
the
record,
and
in
fact
there's
everything
in
the
record
against
it,
and
that
is
mark
lilly
was
never
a
suspect
for
being
the
triggerman.
he
was
told
that
when
he
was
being
interrogated.
ms.
katherine
p.
baldwin
no,
they're
not.
ms.
katherine
p.
baldwin
but
here
we're
talking
about
the
reliability
of
mark
lilly's
statements,
and
that's
all
we're
talking
about.
ms.
katherine
p.
baldwin
i
think
that's
what
the
miranda
rights,
though,
told
mark
lilly,
is
anything
you
say
is
going
to
be
used
against
you.
in
fact,
i
think--
ms.
katherine
p.
baldwin
--well--
ms.
katherine
p.
baldwin
--i
have
to
disagree.
i
think
that
everything
that
mark
lilly
said
was
the
basis
upon
which
he
was
charged
with
first
degree
murder
and
convicted
of
first
degree
murder.
ms.
katherine
p.
baldwin
so,
they
were
self
inculpatory.
ms.
katherine
p.
baldwin
i'm
not
sure
the
test
is
does...
is
the
statement
that
the...
the
individual
is
giving
to
his
advantage
as
to
whether
it's
reliable
or
not.
i'm
not
even
sure
the
test
is,
is
the
statement
he's
giving...
does
he
think
that's
going
to
please
the
police.
of
course.
that
would
be
every
single
confession
situation.
the
test
is,
is
this
an
individual
who
is
making
a
genuinely
self
inculpatory
statement
believing
that
it
will
result
in
his
imprisonment
or...
or
something
like
that.
ms.
katherine
p.
baldwin
and
he
tells
us
that.
ms.
katherine
p.
baldwin
but,
justice--
ms.
katherine
p.
baldwin
--i
think
that
the
cases
have
never
held
that
if
it
is...
if
it
is
something
that
isn't
in
his
best
interest
to
say,
that
that
somehow
makes
it
unreliable.
absent
some
additional
evidence
in
the
case
showing
that
this
is
a
person
who
was
trying
to
fabricate
a
statement
to
get
out
of
trouble
for...
as
in
lee
where
in
lee
v.
illinois,
the
declarant
is
refusing
to
talk
until
the
police
come
in
and
say
essentially
the
other
person
is
saying
you
did
it,
and
so
there
is
a
reason
on
that
issue
for
that
person
to
fabricate
information
on
that
point.
no,
the
other
person
did
the
shooting.
we
don't
have
that
in
this
case.
it
is
strikingly
absent.
to
this
day,
benjamin
lilly
has
never
claimed
that
his
brother
was
either
the
shooter
or
was
any
more
guilty
than
what
he
said
in
his
own
statements.
there's
just...
there's
nothing
in
there
to
indicate
it.
there's
never
been...
in
fact,
there's
never
been
any
evidence
anywhere
in
this
case
that
anyone
other
than
benjamin
lilly
was
the
shooter,
the
only
issue
in
the
case
again.
when...
and
i
think
other
indicia
of
reliability
connected
with
these
statements
which
come
again
from
the
confessions...
and
i
think
it's
important
that
one
of
the
indicia
of
reliability
is
the
fact
that
we
have
transcripts
of
the
statements,
that
we
have
the
tape
of
the
statement
that
this
court
can
listen
to,
that
the
trial
court
could
listen
to,
that
you
can
determine
by
listening
to
the
entire
statement
is
this
a
person
who
is
making
this
up
trying
to
get
out
of
a
death
penalty
or
is
this
something
that
has
the
ring
of
truth,
that
has
reliability
to
it?
ms.
katherine
p.
baldwin
well,
mr.
chief
justice,
i
think
that...
that
that's
the
way
it
came
in.
i
mean,
the
virginia
supreme
court
found
that
this
met
the
requirements
for
the
exception
for
statements
against
penal
interest.
ms.
katherine
p.
baldwin
well,
otherwise
mark
lilly
would
not
be
guilty
today.
i
mean,
these
are...
these
are
statements
that...
and
i
think
one
of
the
tests
that
the
court
can
look
at
is,
is
a
statement
that
any
accomplice
would
say
in
a
confession...
is
it
something
that
could
be
used
against
him
in
his
own
trial?
if
it
is--
ms.
katherine
p.
baldwin
--well,
it
certainly
was,
but--
ms.
katherine
p.
baldwin
--and
that
was
additional
evidence.
ms.
katherine
p.
baldwin
well,
if--
ms.
katherine
p.
baldwin
--i
can
tell
you
this,
that
if
mark
lilly
had
not
pled
guilty,
if
he
had
had
a
trial
with
a
jury,
this
statement
would
have
come
in
and
the
prosecutor
would
have
argued
that
this
statement
showed
that
mark
lilly
committed
first
degree
murder...
was
responsible
for
first
degree
murder.
ms.
katherine
p.
baldwin
i
misspoke
then.
no,
that's
not
the
only
reason.
yes,
the...
the
commonwealth
certainly
would
have
had
other
evidence.
but
if
we're
looking
at
the
self
inculpatory
nature
of
the
statements
themselves.
and...
and
the
questions
i've
been
getting
are...
is
that
if
he
says
somebody
else
did
the
shooting,
somehow
that's
not
self
inculpatory.
my
argument
is
it
certainly
is.
at
his
own
trial
it
would
have
been
admitted
against
him
as
proof
of
guilt.
ms.
katherine
p.
baldwin
well,
i
think
that
there
are
other
indicia
of
reliability.
i
think
that
you
have
to
look
at
the
totality
of
the
circumstances
under
which
the
statement
was
given.
ms.
katherine
p.
baldwin
i
think
it
is.
i
think--
ms.
katherine
p.
baldwin
--yes,
it
does.
ms.
katherine
p.
baldwin
correct.
this
was
a
statement
against
penal
interest.
the
virginia
supreme
court
found
this
came
under
that
and
in
addition
found...
and
in
virginia
what
is
required
is
that
it
meet
the
common
law
exception.
and
in
addition
to
that,
the
prosecutor
has
to
show
that
the
evidence
is
also
corroborated
by
other
evidence.
ms.
katherine
p.
baldwin
if...
if...
no,
your
honor.
i
don't
think
you
would.
ms.
katherine
p.
baldwin
no.
in
the
virginia
supreme
court
it
was...
what
was
litigated
under
the
state
evidentiary
law
was
whether
this
was
reliable
because
that
is
the
touchstone
for
the
state
evidence
to
come
in
under
this
exception.
ms.
katherine
p.
baldwin
oh,
no.
no,
justice
souter,
it
was
not.
the
virginia
supreme
court
found
that
this
was
a
genuinely
self
inculpatory
statement,
that
mark
lilly
knew
was
self
inculpatory
when
he
made
it.
in
other--
ms.
katherine
p.
baldwin
--no.
they
found
that
it
met
the
penal
interest
exception
because
it
was
a
genuinely...
it
was
genuine
statements
against
his
interests
that
he
knew
were
against
his
interests.
ms.
katherine
p.
baldwin
and
then
in
addition
to
that,
there
was
also
corroborating
evidence
to
show
its
reliability.
and
then
in
addition
to
that,
the
virginia
supreme
court
found
that
for
confrontation
clause
purposes,
that
this
was
a
firmly
rooted
exception.
ms.
katherine
p.
baldwin
we're
not
taking
that...
we're
not
taking--
ms.
katherine
p.
baldwin
--no.
ms.
katherine
p.
baldwin
yes.
ms.
katherine
p.
baldwin
i
suppose
the
court
would
have
to
put
that
in
the
not
firmly
rooted.
i...
i
don't
know
how
to...
i
think
there's
a...
there's
a
confusion
between
something
that's
firmly
rooted
and
whether
the
evidence
in
a
particular
case
was
reliable
enough
to
come
in.
ms.
katherine
p.
baldwin
correct.
ms.
katherine
p.
baldwin
i
would
think
that
would
not
count,
but
there's
a
minority
of
states
that
have
said
that
in
those
terms--
ms.
katherine
p.
baldwin
--to
my
knowledge
of
any
states--
ms.
katherine
p.
baldwin
--i
understand.
ms.
katherine
p.
baldwin
i
think
there
are
very
few
states
that
have
said
that
in
such
categorical
terms.
now,
what
a
lot
of
cases
have
said
is
that
in
a
particular
case,
the
evidence
doesn't...
is
not
reliable.
and--
ms.
katherine
p.
baldwin
--correct.
i
think...
i
think
you...
we
have
no
argument
with
the
fact
that
there
could
be,
i
guess,
a
subcategory
of
factual
situations
where
the
evidence
doesn't
come
in,
but
i
think
the
question
is
who
gets
to
decide
whether
the
evidence
is
reliable
enough.
and...
and
obviously,
the
petitioner's
argument
is
that...
at
least
until
argument
this
morning,
has
been
that
there
should
be
a
per
se
rule.
it
just...
it
doesn't
come
in
at
all.
it
can't
even
be
considered
by
the
lower
courts.
and...
and...
and
i
think,
you
know,
our
argument
is...
is
actually
pretty
simple,
and
that
is
that
this
is
just
a
pure
evidentiary
matter
to
be
decided
upon
the
facts
of
individual
cases,
the
facts
and
circumstances,
and
that
that's
what
occurred
here.
and
i
think
that
the...
the
factors
in
the
case,
the
fact
that
during
this
confession
there
were
no
promises
of
leniency
made,
the
fact
that
mark
lilly
had
the
miranda
warnings
given
to
him,
the
fact
that
he
was
caught
when
he
was
arrested
before
he
even
had
a
chance
to
talk
to
gary
barker
or
anybody
else
to
decide
who
was
going
to
fabricate
some
story,
the
fact
that
these
were
statements
against
his
own
brother,
the
fact
that
he
made
these
statements
and
clearly
the
tenor
of
the
statements
in
the
confession
on
the
audiotapes
was
that
he
was
very
reluctant
to
say
anything
bad
about
his
brother...
in
fact,
it
was
gary
barker
who
said
a
lot
more,
went
to
much
more
extreme
and
more
detail
as
to
what
ben
lilly
had
done
and
said.
mark
lilly
was
reluctant,
and
the
fact
that
his...
his
statements
were
i
believe
genuinely
self
inculpatory.
and
to
the
extent
that
a
particular
statement
this
court
would
believe
was
not
self
inculpatory,
it...
virginia
allows
in
an
entire
statement,
including
collateral
statements,
to
a...
an
inculpatory
statement.
and
there's
nothing
in
the
constitution
that
prevents
such
a
rule.
williamson--
ms.
katherine
p.
baldwin
--mr.
chief
justice,
i
see
my
light.
may
i
answer
the
question?
ms.
katherine
p.
baldwin
that
is
not
our
position,
justice
ginsburg.
our
position
is--
ms.
katherine
p.
baldwin
--thank
you.
