mr.
ira
s.
sacks
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
over
the
years,
this
court
has
spoke
in
disparate,
sometimes
sharply
divided
voices
regarding
many
confrontation
clause
issues.
however,
this
court
has
been
of
one
voice
concerning
confessions
of
an
accomplice
given
in
custody
incriminating
a
defendant.
they
have
been
consistently
viewed
as
inevitably
suspect,
inherently
unreliable,
less
reliable
than
ordinary
hearsay,
and
presumptively
inadmissible.
the
opportunity
to
cross
examine
an
accomplice
regarding
a
statement
incriminating
the
accused
lies
at
the
core
of
the
confrontation
clause.
mr.
ira
s.
sacks
your
honor,
i
think
the...
the
test
for
that
is
as
follows.
i
think
the...
the
test
for
that
depends
on
many
other
things
about
the
statement.
first,
a
court
needs
to
look
at
whether
it's
against
that
person's
penal
interest
and
then
you
start
with
the
test.
and
then
the
question
becomes
whether
the
statement
is
such,
the
circumstances
and
whether
one
looks
in
wright
at
just
the
circumstances
of
making
the
confession
or
the
totality
of
the
circumstances...
whether
the
circumstances
are
such
that
cross
examination
of
the
declarant,
of
the
accomplice,
would
be
of
marginal
utility.
that's
the
bedrock.
mr.
ira
s.
sacks
i...
i
agree
with
that,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
think,
however,
that
in
dealing
with
the
firmly
rooted
hearsay
exceptions
that
were
viewed
as
an
exception,
if
you
will,
under
the
confrontation
clause,
this
court
has
observed
that
those
exceptions
were
such
that
cross
examination
of
virtually
any
declarant
who
fell
within
such
an
exception
would
be
of
marginal
utility,
and
that
is
not
the
case
with
statements
of
an
accomplice
for
two
reasons.
one,
with
respect
to
a
statement
of
an
accomplice
incriminating
a
defendant,
those
statements
are,
as
this
court
has
observed
and
in
situations
where
it's
against
the
accomplice's
penal
interest,
that
those
are
inevitably
suspect
and
inherently
admissible.
on
the
one--
mr.
ira
s.
sacks
--lee.
mr.
ira
s.
sacks
oh,
no
question.
your
honor,
if
you
consider
the
confession
of
the
accomplice
thomas
in
lee
where
the
core
of
that
confession
is,
is
that
lee
and
i
planned
the
murder
of
aunt
beedie,
thomas
would
not
have
been
responsible
at
all
for
the
murder
of
aunt
beedie
absent
that
confession,
as...
as
was...
was
noted
in
the
dissent
by
justice
blackmun
in
the
lee
case.
mr.
ira
s.
sacks
the...
the
confession
of
mr.
thomas
in
the
lee
case
was
unambiguously
against
his
penal
interest,
and
despite
that,
it
was
held
by
the
court
in
lee
that
the
right
of
lee
to
confront
thomas
on
the
stand
on
cross
examination
was
required
by
the
confrontation
clause.
mr.
ira
s.
sacks
no,
your
honor,
i
don't.
i
think
that...
that
what...
that
what
a
court
has
to
first
do
is
recognize
that
there's
a
different
test
for
custodial
statements
of
an
accomplice
that
incriminated
a
defendant
than
just
declarations
against
penal
interest.
i
think
that's
what
this
court
was
getting
at
in
footnote
5
of
lee
when
it
said
that
in
looking
for
whether
there's
a
confrontation
clause
exception
for
this
category,
the
category
we're
dealing
with
is
not
declarations
against
penal
interest,
but
confessions
of
an
accomplice.
and
then
what
one
has
to
look
is
whether
the
circumstances
are
such
that
cross
examination
would
be
of
marginal
utility.
i
can
imagine...
and
i
think
there
are
situations
where...
because
we
do
not
ask
for
a
per
se
rule...
where
there
would
be
circumstances
that
were
such
that
cross
examination
would
be
of
marginal
utility.
the
types
of
factors
that
a
court
could
look
at
would
be,
one...
and
these
are
all
suggested
by
these...
by
this
court's
decisions.
one,
is
the...
is
the
accomplice
admitting
or
implicating
himself
in
something
more
than
he's
implicating
the
accused?
two,
is
there
blame
shifting
involved
in
the
sense
that
blame
shifting
was
defined
by
justice
kennedy's
concurrence
in
williamson?
is
there
blame
shifting?
is
the...
is
the
accomplice
attempting
to
shift
blame?
if
he's
not,
that's
another
factor
in
favor
of
finding
an
exception.
third,
was
the
statement
spontaneous?
was
the
statement
done
in
response
to
leading
questions?
but
the...
fourth,
was
it
in
custody?
because
this
court's
decisions
have
also
made
very
plain
that
situations
in
custody
are
different
than
a
situation--
mr.
ira
s.
sacks
--your
honor,
mr.
chief
justice,
with
all
due
respect,
i
think
that
in
williamson,
which
i
agree
is
a...
is
a
federal
rule
804(b)(3)
case,
that
the...
that
the
discussion
in
williamson
about
the
difference
under
the
federal
rules,
804(b)(3),
of
a...
of
a...
of
a
statement
to
another
prisoner,
as
in
dutton
v.
evans,
as
opposed
to
a
statement
in
custody
makes
a
great
deal
of
difference.
and...
and
that
makes
sense,
mr.
chief
justice.
this...
this
case...
in
this
case
you
have
a
situation
where
gary
barker
was
questioned
before
mark
lilly.
the
police...
and
this
is
not
to
ascribe
any
bad
motives
of
the
police,
but
just
to
talk
about
the
normal
situation.
mark
lilly
is
then
questioned,
but
both
of
his
statements
indicate,
on
the
face
of
the
statements,
that
there
was
questioning
of
mark
lilly
before
the
tape
was
turned
on.
in
the
first
statement
that
was
taken
from
mark
lilly,
he
gets
to
a
point
where
he...
where
he
says
to...
to...
to
investigator
price
in
response
to
tell
us
what
happened,
nothing
that
you...
you
already
don't
know,
man.
in
the
second
one...
in
the...
in
the
statement
taken
by
mr....
by
investigator
or
detective
hamlin,
the
tape
is
turned
on
at
2
o'clock.
mr.
hamlin
says,
it's
2
o'clock.
then
they
paused
for
him
to
sign
the
miranda
statement,
and
then
it
goes
back
on
at
2:30.
in
situations
like
that,
there's
every
reason
to
say
that
there's
something
different
about
a
carefully
tailored
confession
in
custody
in
terms
of
its
reliability
than
a
statement
that
somebody
walks
up
to
somebody
else
on
the
street
or
walks
up
to
somebody
else
in
the
prison
yard
and
says,
you
know,
by
the
way,
you
know,
if
it
wasn't
for
that
guy
evans,
i
wouldn't
be
here
right
now.
but
the
bedrock
it
seems
to
me,
your
honor,
under
this
court's
decisions
is
you
have
a
right
to
confrontation
and
there's
an
exception
to
the
right
to
confrontation
if
the
nature
of
the
statement
is
such
that
cross
examination
of
the
declarant
would
be
of
marginal
utility.
now,
that
may
be
a
hard
test,
but
that's
what
the
sixth
amendment
is
about.
mr.
ira
s.
sacks
yes.
mr.
ira
s.
sacks
well,
you
know,
it's...
it's
at...
the
answer
is
that
we
would
be
happy
if
this
court
decided
to
adopt
the
view
of
justice
thomas,
joined
by
justice
scalia,
in
wright
because
we
believe
that
either
under
lee
and
what
i
would
call
existing
case
law
or
under
the
suggestion
by
justice
thomas
in
white
and
the
concurrence
that
a
hard
and
fast
rule
be
used
for
the
confrontation
clause,
we
think
that
either
way,
the
decision
has
to
be
reversed
because
as
i
understand
the
concurring
opinion
in
white
it
would
extend
the
right
of
confrontation
to
witnesses
who
testify
and
to
testimonial
material
such
as
affidavits,
depositions,
prior
testimony,
and
confessions,
and
there
would
not
be
an
exception
for
reliable
statements.
in
the
words
of
justice
thomas
at
page
363
of
the
opinion,
nor
does
it
seem
likely
that
the
drafters
of
the
sixth
amendment
intended
to
permit
a
defendant
to
be
tried
on
the
basis
of
ex
parte
affidavits
found
to
be
reliable.
so,
although
we
believe--
mr.
ira
s.
sacks
--well,
it's...
it's...
but
the...
the
extension
that
justice
thomas
used
there
was
formalized
testimonial
material
such
as
affidavits,
depositions,
prior
testimony,
or
confessions.
and
i
think
the...
the
thrust
of
the
concurrence--
mr.
ira
s.
sacks
--yes.
and
the
thrust
of
the
concurrence,
as...
as
we
understand
it
is,
it
would...
it
would
divorce
confrontation
clause
jurisprudence
from
the
hearsay
rule.
it
would
look
at
the
literal
language
of
the
clause.
it
would
apply
it
to
witnesses
and
to
testimonial
materials
and
not
other
extrajudicial
materials,
and
it
would
be
a
hard
and
fast
rule.
and
it
wouldn't
matter
how
reliable
the...
the...
those
statements
were
or
were
not.
and
although
we
believe
that
petitioner
is
entitled
to
a
reversal
of
the
judgment
of
the
supreme
court
of
virginia
based
on
existing
law,
we
believe
it's
also
plain
that
there
would
be
reversal
required
under
the
view
of
the
sixth
amendment
that
justice
thomas,
joined
by
justice
scalia,
had
described
in
the
concurrence
in
white.
i
want
to
deal
with
the
issue
of
firmly
rooted
and
whether
the
evidence
in
this
case
fell
within
a
firmly
rooted
hearsay
exception
mostly
because
the
state
of
virginia
and
the
amici
in
support
of
the
state
of
virginia
spend
so
much
time
on
it.
mr.
ira
s.
sacks
justice
ginsburg,
the...
the
reason
why...
and
conceding
is
probably...
is...
is
probably
too...
too
strong
a
word.
we
are...
we
are...
under
this
court's
current
case
law,
as
we
understand
it,
we
understand
that
this
court's
current
case
law
has
to
some
degree
linked
hearsay,
hearsay
exceptions--
mr.
ira
s.
sacks
--as
a
general
rule,
but
this
court
in
inadi
indicated
that...
that
roberts
did
not
intend
to
have
its
rule
as
a
rule
that
applied
in
all
circumstances,
and
that,
at
least
in
the
words
of
the
court
in
inadi,
that...
that
there...
there
would
be
exception
that
courts
in...
that
the
court
in
roberts
was
not
seeking
to
have
a
rule
that
applied
in
all
circumstances.
and
in
fact,
in
both
inadi
and
in
white,
this
court
has
disregarded
a
portion
of
the
roberts
general
rule.
mr.
ira
s.
sacks
that's
truly
correct,
mr.
chief
justice.
but
getting
back--
mr.
ira
s.
sacks
--with
all
due
respect,
mr.
chief
justice,
it
went
way
beyond
a
recognized
hearsay
exception.
it
went
in
my
view,
in
terms
of
what
the
court
was
looking
at
in
white
and
inadi,
to
situations
where
the
court
recognized
that
the
hearsay...
that
the
evidence
there
fell
within...
and
the
category
of
evidence
there
fell
within
a
hearsay
exception
that
was
firmly
rooted
and
firmly
rooted
in
the
sense
that
cross
examination...
and
this
is
in
the
opinion
in
white,
adopting
from
the
opinion
in
wright...
that
cross
examination
of
the
declarant
would
be
of
marginal
utility.
that
is
the
bedrock
principle
that
is
linked
with
firmly
rooted
hearsay
exceptions.
and
i
don't
think
that
this
court
has
meant
to
suggest
that
merely
on
the
basis
of
a
hearsay
exception,
that
you
lose
your
right
to
confrontation.
i
think
it's
far
more
than
that.
now,
to...
to...
to
finish
the...
the
concept,
justice
ginsburg,
it's...
our
understanding
is
on
the
court's...
this
court's
current
case
law
that
there
is
a
link
to
some
degree,
to
a
significant
degree,
under
roberts
between
hearsay,
hearsay
exceptions,
and
firmly
rooted
hearsay
exceptions
on
the
one
hand
and
confrontation
on
the
other.
we
believe
that
even
under
that
standard,
we
are
entitled...
petitioner
is
entitled
to
reversal
of
the
decision
of
the
supreme
court
of
virginia.
we
also
adopt
the
views,
as
i...
as
i
said
to
justice
stevens...
we
adopt
the
views
expressed
in
the
concurrence
in
white
in
the...
and
in
the
amicus
petition
submitted
by
the
american
civil
liberties
union
in
support
of
petitioner
that
would
separate
the
notion
of
confrontation
from
the
hearsay
rules.
we
think
that
what
has
happened
with
the
hearsay
rules
is...
is
that
you've
wound
up
with
a
lot
of
labels
and
not
a
lot
of
answers.
and
one
of
my
disabilities
as
a...
as
a
lawyer
as
i
grew
up
as
an
antitrust
lawyer,
and
i
was
thinking
about
this
argument,
and
there
is
a
phrase
in
bmi
v.
cbs
which...
which
is
441
u.s.
1,
which
has
nothing
to
do
with
this
case
other
than
being
an
apt
phrase,
which
is
that
easy
labels
do
not
always
supply
ready
answers.
and
that's
the
problem
with
firmly
rooted
hearsay
exceptions.
if
you
deal
with
firmly
rooted
hearsay
exceptions,
as
this
court
has
done,
one
has
to
not
forget
why
one
is
looking
at
that.
mr.
ira
s.
sacks
the
broader
principle
that
was
urged
below
in
the...
in
the
supreme
court
of
virginia
was
that
these
statements
were
not
sufficiently
reliable
to
be
admitted
under
the
confrontation
clause.
and
when
you
get
to
the
notion
of
firmly
rooted,
the
problem
with
the
firmly
rooted
label
is
that
some
courts,
particularly
some
lower
courts,
forget
why
this
court
has
asked
courts
to
look
at
that.
the
reason
for
looking
at
whether
something
is
a
firmly
rooted
hearsay
exception,
one,
you're
supposed
to
be
looking
at
whether
the
evidence
or
the
category
of
evidence
falls
within
a
firmly
rooted
hearsay
exception.
and
two,
the
reason
for
looking
at
it
is
because
this
court
has
observed
with
respect
to
some
firmly
rooted
hearsay
exceptions
that
virtually
all
evidence
within
them
meets
the
constitutional
norm
and
makes
the
declarant
someone
whose
cross
examination
would
be
of
marginal
utility.
and
it
is
important
for
this
court
and
other
courts
not
to
forget
that
that's
the
reason
why
we
look
at
firmly
rooted
exceptions.
in
this
case,
if
you
look
at
the
key
piece
of
evidence...
and
there's
lots
of
stuff
in
mark
lilly's
statement
that
shouldn't
come
in,
but
let's
look
at
the
statement
by
mark
lilly,
petitioner
was
the
triggerman.
that
is
not
within
a
firmly
rooted
hearsay
exception.
you
can
start
off
with
the
principle
that
that
is
not
self
inculpatory.
it
is
the
classic--
mr.
ira
s.
sacks
--well,
you
know,
that's...
and...
and
maybe...
and
maybe
that's
the
reason
to...
to
just
overturn.
maybe
what
you
really
have
to
say,
mr.
chief
justice,
is
that
the
virginia
supreme
court
got
it
right
when
they
said
that
mark
lilly's
statement
was
self
serving,
and
then
they
got
it
wrong
when
they
said
that
went
to...
went
to
weight,
not
admissibility.
it's...
it's
surely
not
against
his
self
interest.
it
is
surely
self
serving.
it
would
not
be
admissible
under
rule
804(b)(3)
of
the
federal
rules
of
evidence.
it
would
not
be
admissible
under
at
least
30,
if
not
35--
mr.
ira
s.
sacks
--oh,
no.
it's...
it's...
i
don't
think
that
that
statement
was
inculpatory
of
mark
lilly
at
all.
mr.
ira
s.
sacks
as...
putting
aside
mark
lilly's
statement,
justice
kennedy?
no,
i'm...
i'm
saying
that
if
you
have
a
statement--
mr.
ira
s.
sacks
--yes.
mr.
ira
s.
sacks
no.
they
might
be.
if
you
take...
if
you
take
some
of
the
examples
that--
mr.
ira
s.
sacks
--i
think
that
you
look
at
several--
mr.
ira
s.
sacks
--well,
it's...
it's...
in
answering
the
broad
question,
justice
kennedy,
as
to
whether
ever
a
statement
which
incriminates...
a
statement
by
a
declarant
that
incriminates
the
defendant
could
be
a
declaration
against
penal
interest
that
fell
within...
that
was
such
that
cross
examination
would
be
of
marginal
utility,
i
could
conceive
of
such
a
case
based
on
the
factors
that
i
talked
about
before
which
would
be
does
it
inculpate
the
declarant
more
than
the
defendant,
does
it
attempt
to
shift
blame,
was
it
spontaneous,
and...
and...
and
although
i
don't
think
this
is
so
much
a
matter
of
corroboration
as
adoption,
whether
there
is
a
confession
by
the
defendant
that
matches
in
all
significant
respects
the
statement
by
the
declarant.
that's
not
what
we
have
here.
but
i
think
as
a
general
category,
we're
not
seeking
a
per
se
rule.
we
concede
under
current
doctrine,
as
opposed
to
under
the
position
advanced
in
the
concurrence
by
justice
thomas
in
the
white
case...
we
can...
we
would
concede
under
current
doctrine
that
there
might
be
circumstances
where
a
statement
by
an...
by
a
declarant
which
incriminated
the
defendant
might
be
such
where
the
circumstances
made
it
that
cross
examination
of
the
declarant
would
be
of
marginal
utility.
we
don't
think
this
is
remotely
close
to
the
line
because
here,
as
the
chief
justice
indicated
in
response
to
my
comment,
the
statement,
petitioner
was
the
triggerman,
isn't
even
self
inculpatory
of
mark
lilly.
it
isn't
even
self
inculpatory.
it
wouldn't
come
in
under
the
federal
rules.
it
wouldn't
come
in
under
30
or
35
out
of
the
36
state
laws
that
were
surveyed
in
our
brief.
now,
the
commonwealth
of
virginia--
mr.
ira
s.
sacks
--i...
i
think
at
some
point
the
whole...
the
whole
confession
has
to
go,
but
i
think
that...
that,
justice
scalia,
you're
quite
right
that
our
view
is
that
you
look
at
the
specific
statements,
as
this
court
suggested
under
rule
804(b)(3)
you
look
at
specific
statements,
and
you
take
those
specific
statements
and
you
test
those
specific
statements.
now,
at
some
point,
it
may
be
that
the
confession
as
a
whole
is
so...
is...
is
so
self
serving
as
opposed
to
inculpatory
that
even
the
statements
that
were
against
mark
lilly's
penal
interest
purely
would
be
excluded.
but
i
think
the...
the
answer
in
the
abstract
is,
yes,
some
portions
could
come
in
and
some
portions
would
be
excluded.
mr.
ira
s.
sacks
well,
let
me...
let
me
take
that--
mr.
ira
s.
sacks
--in
two...
in
two
pieces,
justice
scalia.
i
think
that
you
have
to
start
off
with
the
proposition
that
there's
a
confrontation
clause
and
that
the
petitioner
had
the
right
to
cross
examine
the
witnesses
against
him.
and
if
all
mark
lilly
had
said
was,
it
was
cold
and
the
moon
was
out
down
at
whitethorn
near
the
side
tracks,
i
don't
know
why
that
comes
in
under
the
confrontation
clause.
it
may
be
that
counsel
might
not
choose
to
object
to
that
if
that
was
the
only
part
that
was
coming
in,
but
under
the
confrontation
clause,
that's
not
within
a
hearsay
exception.
it's
surely
not
within
a
firmly
rooted
hearsay
exception.
perhaps
someone
wouldn't
want
to
cross
examine.
so,
therefore,
maybe
that's
one
where
you
would
toss
out
the...
the
labels
and
say,
well,
cross
examination
would
be
of
marginal
utility
because
you
could
look
in
the
roanoke
times
and
see
that
it
was
cold
and
the
moon
was
out.
mr.
ira
s.
sacks
it
might
be
if
that
was
the...
if
that
was
an
issue
in
the
case,
but
as...
as...
as
i
understood
the
hypothetical
and
as...
and
i
was...
as
i
was
responding
to
justice
scalia,
just
saying
it
was
cold
and
the
moon
was
out
might
not
be
against
mark
lilly's
penal
interest.
it
also
could
be.
it
also
very
well
could
be.
mr.
ira
s.
sacks
well,
justice
stevens,
i
think
that
if
you
get
to
what
i
believe
is
a
bedrock
test,
which
is
whether
cross
examination
of
the
declarant
would
be
of
marginal
utility,
i
think
that
one
would
have
to
concede,
if
the
court
could
take
judicial
notice
that
it
was
cold
and
if
the
court
could
take
judicial
notice
that
there
was
a
full
moon,
that
perhaps
cross
examination
would
be
of
marginal
utility.
i
think
that
in
the
abstract
under
the
current
way
that
this
court
has
tested
statements
of
an
accomplice,
that
it
doesn't
fall
within...
it
probably
doesn't
fall
within
a
hearsay
exception
and
it
probably
doesn't
fall
within
a
firmly
rooted
hearsay
exception.
now,
looking...
looking
at
the
arguments
that
the
commonwealth
and...
and
their...
the
amici
in
support
of
the
commonwealth
make,
they
spend
a
lot
of
time
talking
about
the
widespread
nature
of
declarations
against
penal
interest
and
how
they're
way
more
widespread
today
than
they
were
in
1968.
and
the
point
that
that
misses
is
that
under
current
doctrine...
and
again,
you
know,
put...
separating
current
doctrine
from
the
alternative
test
of
just
a...
a
flat
sixth
amendment
bar
to...
to
statements
like
confessions
coming
in--
mr.
ira
s.
sacks
--no,
your
honor.
mr.
chief
justice,
i
was
using
that
as
a
shorthand
to
the
suggestion
in
the
questioning
that
what
position
would
the
petitioner
take
with
respect
to
this
court's
adoption
of
the
position
asserted
by
justice
thomas,
joined
by
justice
scalia,
in
the
concurrence
in
white.
and...
and
it
is...
it
is
an
alternative
only
in
terms
of
our
advocacy
and
not
in
terms
of
this
court's
doctrine.
that
is
quite
correct.
but
the...
the
issue
for
the
firmly
rooted
question
is
whether
the
evidence
at
issue
or
the
category
of
evidence
at
issue
falls
within
a
firmly
rooted
hearsay
exception
and
not
whether
there
is
an
exception
out
there
in
the
abstract.
and
this
court
in
footnote
5
in
lee
indicated
we
think
plainly...
and
i
realize
it
was
in
a
footnote...
and
correctly
that
in
cases
like
this,
saying
that
it's
a
declaration
against
penal
interest
is
too
broad
a
category
for
confrontation
clause
analysis,
and
you
have
to...
and...
and
that
the
courts
have
to
recognize
that
what
this
is
is
a
statement
of
an
accomplice
incriminating
the
defendant.
and
there's
a
good
reason
for
making
that
distinction
because
as
we
pointed
out
in
our
reply
brief,
the
treatment
of
declarations
against
penal
interest
and
the
treatment
of
the
subcategory
of...
of
statements
of
an
accomplice
incriminating
a
defendant
under
the
federal
rules
is
different
and
under
various
state
laws
are
different.
now,
the
criminal
justice
legal
foundation
also
spends
a
lot
of
time
talking
about
how
in
1968
when
bruton
was
decided,
declarations
against
penal
interest
were
not
as
widespread,
but
they're
very
widespread
now.
and
we
think
that
also
misses
the
point.
we
think
the
point
is
not
how
widespread
declarations
against
penal
interest
as
an
exception
to
hearsay
was
in
1968,
or
in
1994
when
williamson
was
decided,
but
whether
custodial
statements
of
an
accomplice
which
incriminate
a
defendant
are
more
reliable
today
than
they
were
in
1968
when
bruton
was
decided
or
1994
when
williamson
was
decided.
mr.
ira
s.
sacks
well,
i
think...
i
think
that...
that
what
has
happened...
and
this
is...
and
this
is...
this
is
true
i
think
even
in...
in
the
decisions
of
this
court
looking
at
the
issue
of...
in
the
context
of
rule
804(b)(3).
the
common
law,
in
having...
in
carving
out
penal
interest
as
a
hearsay
exception,
has
evolved,
and
people...
and...
and
the
courts
have
recognized
and
legislatures
have
recognized
that
the
pure
category
of
statements
against
penal
interest
without
the
additional,
if
you
will,
baggage
of
being
self
serving
or
also
incriminating
the...
a
defendant,
can
be
reliable
and
can
meet
the
test
of
reliability
necessary
to
qualify
as
an
exception
for
the
hearsay
rule.
and
that
is
why
the
general
exception
for
declarations
against
penal
interest
is
more
widespread
today.
what--
mr.
ira
s.
sacks
--no.
it's
that...
it's
that
more
states...
more
states
have
a
statute
or
a
rule
of
law
that--
mr.
ira
s.
sacks
--that...
that...
that
would
admit
as
a
hearsay
exception
a
declaration
against
penal
interest,
but
not
that
would
admit
a
statement
of
a
declarant
which
was
in
part
inculpatory...
self
inculpatory
but
which
also
incriminated
a
defendant.
and
our
review,
which
we
set
forth
in
our
reply
brief
of...
that
law
indicates
that
under
the
federal
rules
and
under
30
to
35
of
the
36
states
where
we
found
legislation
or
rules
would
exclude
that.
i
think
at
bottom
what
you
come
down
to
in
this
case
is
there
is
nothing
in
the...
nothing
about
the
circumstances
of
this
confession
or,
if
one
goes
beyond
wright
and
looks
at
the
other
corroborating
evidence
which
makes
cross
examination
of
mark
lilly
of
marginal
utility,
that's
the
bedrock
current
principle.
and
for
that
reason
and
that
reason
alone,
the
decision
of
the
virginia
supreme
court
should
be
reversed.
and
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time--
mr.
ira
s.
sacks
mr.
chief
justice,
we
waive
our
rebuttal.
