the
second
case
i
have
to
announce
is
florida
versus
white,
no.
98-223.
this
case
comes
to
us
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
supreme
court
of
florida.
after
the
police
arrested
respondent
on
charges
unrelated
to
this
case,
they
seized
his
car
because
they
believe
that
it
was
forfeitable
under
florida's
contraband
forfeiture
act.
they
did
not
secure
warrant
authorizing
the
seizure.
during
a
subsequent
inventory
search
the
police
discovered
cocaine
in
the
car.
as
a
result,
respondent
was
charged
with
drug
possession.
respondent
moved
to
suppress
the
cocaine
on
the
grounds
that
the
warrantless
seizure
of
the
car
violated
the
fourth
amendment.
although
the
trial
and
appellate
courts
rejected
this
argument,
the
supreme
court
held
that,
absent
exigent
circumstances,
a
warrantless
seizure
of
an
automobile
under
the
forfeiture
act
violated
the
fourth
amendment.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today
we
reverse.
over
70
years
ago
in
carroll
verus
united
states
we
held
that
the
fourth
amendment
does
not
require
police
to
obtain
a
warrant
before
searching
a
car
for
and
seizing
contraband.
our
holding
was
rooted
in
federal
law
enforcement
practice
at
the
time
that
the
fourth
amendment
was
adopted.
specifically,
we
noted
that
early
congresses
authorized
federal
officers
to
conduct
warrantless
searches
of
ships
and
to
seize
concealed
goods
subject
to
duties.
the
principles
underlying
the
rule
in
carroll
and
the
founding-era
statutes
upon
which
they
were
based
support
our
conclusion
that
the
warrantless
seizure
of
respondent's
car
did
not
violate
the
fourth
amendment.
although
the
police
lacked
probable
cause
to
believe
that
respondent's
car
contained
contraband,
they
certainly
had
probable
cause
to
believe
that
the
vehicle
itself
was
contraband
under
florida
law.
recognition
of
the
need
to
seize
readily
movable
contraband
before
it
is
spirited
away,
undoubtedly
underlies
the
early
federal
laws
relied
upon
in
carroll.
this
need
is
equally
weighty
when
the
automobile,
as
opposed
to
its
contents,
is
the
contraband
that
the
police
seek
to
secure.
in
addition,
our
fourth
amendment
jurisprudence
has
consistently
given
police
greater
latitude
in
exercising
their
duties
in
public
places.
indeed,
the
facts
of
this
case
are
nearly
indistinguishable
from
those
in
g.
m.
leasing
corp.
versus
the
united
states.
in
that
1977
case
we
held
that
federal
agents
did
not
violate
the
fourth
amendment
by
failing
to
secure
a
warrant
prior
to
seizing
automobiles
in
partial
satisfaction
of
income
tax
assessments.
therefore,
based
on
the
relevant
history
and
our
prior
precedent,
we
conclude
that
the
fourth
amendment
did
not
require
a
warrant
to
seize
respondent's
automobile
in
these
circumstances.
