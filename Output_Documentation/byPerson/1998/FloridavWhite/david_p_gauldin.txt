mr.
david
p.
gauldin
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
state
of
florida
had
68
to
80
days
in
which
to
obtain
a
warrant
to
seize
this
vehicle.
they
didn't
bother.
the
state
of
florida
has
now
had
6
years
and
about
20
minutes
to
explain
to
explain
why
they
didn't
get
a
warrant.
they
haven't
done
so
adequately.
simply
our
position
is
this.
none
of
the
traditional
warrant
exceptions
to
the
fourth
amendment
apply.
there
is
no
civil
forfeiture
exception
to
the
fourth
amendment,
and
under
the
circumstances
of
this
case,
the
police
were
required
to
get
a
warrant--
mr.
david
p.
gauldin
--cooper
v.
california
only
dealt
with
a
subsequent
inventory
search
after
the
car
had
been
seized.
the
issue
was
not
placed
before
the
court
as
to
whether
the
seizure
was
appropriate.
no
one
argued
that,
so
that
issue
was
not
decided
by
this
court.
mr.
david
p.
gauldin
it
may
well
have
assumed
it,
but
that
just
simply
was
not
an
issue
before
the
court.
at
that
point,
it
was
assumed
that
it
was
valid,
and
the
only
issue
that
you
decided
was
once
it
came
lawfully
into
the
police's
hands...
into
the
police
hands,
whether
they
have
a
right
to
conduct
an
inventory
search.
and
cooper
v.
california,
as
far
as
i
read
the
decision,
simply
stands
for
that
proposition.
mr.
david
p.
gauldin
g.m.
leasing
represents
the
tax
levied
on
a
public
street
exception
of
the
fourth
amendment.
in
g.m.
leasing,
as
you'll
recall,
the
revenue
agents
went
first
to
the
home
of
who
turned
out
to
be
the
fugitive
tax
debtor
2
days
prior
to
the
seizure
of
the
car,
and
they
informed
the
wife,
i
believe
it
was,
of
the
tax
debtor
and
also
the
son
that
there
was
a
tax
debt
and
that
their
assets
were
subject
to--
mr.
david
p.
gauldin
--yes,
but
g.m.
leasing
was
not
a
forfeiture
case.
g.m.
leasing
was
a
case
where
the
government
had
a
tax
debt
that
it
was
satisfying,
which
it
did
by
first
filing
a
lien
2
days
prior
to
the
seizure
in
the
salt
lake
city
county
courthouse
and
then
proceeded
to
levy
on
the
government's
debt.
moreover--
mr.
david
p.
gauldin
--probably
because
tax
assessments
seemed
to
create
a
special
class.
the
tax
assessments--
mr.
david
p.
gauldin
--what
the
court
did
say--
mr.
david
p.
gauldin
--what
the
court
said
in
g.m.
leasing,
it
went
back
to
the
history
of
the
tax
legislation
and
the
taxing
power,
which
is
a
constitutional
power,
it
went
back
to
the
history
of
that
and
said
almost--
mr.
david
p.
gauldin
--no.
it's
a
statutory...
it's
a
statutory
right
that
they're
giving
law
enforcement.
mr.
david
p.
gauldin
it
certainly
does
that.
but
first,
the
constitution
specifically
provides
for
the
collection
of
taxes.
secondly,
in
bull
v.
united
states
and
various
other
cases
that
you
have
dealt
with
in
relation
to
taxes,
you
have
justified
this
on
the
base...
basis
of
the
prompt
collection
of
the
revenue
of
taxes
saying
that,
in
fact,
the
very
realm...
or
the
very
united
states
government
depends
upon
the
prompt
collection
of
taxes.
mr.
david
p.
gauldin
well,
one
thing,
of
course,
the
tax
debt
has
been
determined
to
be
a
tax
debt.
according
to
your
tax
bases,
they--
mr.
david
p.
gauldin
--to
satisfy
the
debt
or
the
forfeiture?
mr.
david
p.
gauldin
well,
g.m.
leasing
was
not
a
case
that
involved
probable
cause.
what
g.--
mr.
david
p.
gauldin
--okay,
well--
mr.
david
p.
gauldin
--the
distinction,
at
least
in
my
view,
is
that
at
least
in
the
civil
forfeiture
area,
they
did
not
have
a
specific
exception
that
has
been
validated
by
this
court
to
the
fourth
amendment
for
a
seizure.
there
now
exists,
as
i
said
early,
a
specific
exception
for
the
seizure
for
tax
levies,
which
means
a
tax
judgment,
because
a
tax
assessment
is
equivalent
to
a
tax
judgment.
mr.
david
p.
gauldin
yes,
we
do
and
i
hope--
mr.
david
p.
gauldin
--yes,
we
do,
and
in
fact
bull
v.
united--
mr.
david
p.
gauldin
--that's
exactly
right.
mr.
david
p.
gauldin
no,
we
do
not,
and
that's
what
bull
v.
united
states
says,
that
that's
the
system
that
we
have
in
taxing:
the
assessment
comes
first
and
the
defense
comes
second.
mr.
david
p.
gauldin
i
don't
know,
but
in
light
of
the
legislative
problems
and
hearings
recently,
maybe
you'll
reconsider
that.
but
that's
not
the
case
here.
the
case
here--
mr.
david
p.
gauldin
--there
was
not
only
a
kind
of
process
because
first
a
tax
assessment
had
occurred,
which
is
equivalent
apparently
in
tax
law
to
a
tax
judgment.
secondly,
a
lien
had
been
filed,
and
third,
they
had
gone
to
the
place
and
informed
at
least
the
wife
of
the
tax
debtor
of
the
imminence
of
that.
so,
they
had
notice
and
opportunity
that
the
seizure
would
occur.
mr.
david
p.
gauldin
no,
other
than
that
they
went
to
the
county
courthouse
and
filed
a
tax
lien
so
at
least
you
had
notice
and
opportunity,
which
is
more
than...
than
you
have
here.
mr.
david
p.
gauldin
to
institute
whatever
procedures--
mr.
david
p.
gauldin
--well--
mr.
david
p.
gauldin
--well,
the
notice
did
do
them
something
because
they
hauled
a
bunch
of
crates
of
information
and
stuff
in
the
other
part
of
g.m.
leasing.
mr.
david
p.
gauldin
true,
although...
and
you're
right,
they're
placed
on
constructive
notice.
but
the
owner
of
the
property,
at
least
the
wife's
owner
did
know,
and
the
only
the
reason
the
owner
of
the
property
didn't
know
because
he
was
a
tax
fugitive
at
the
time.
mr.
david
p.
gauldin
that
was
part
of
the
foundation
from
which
the
court's
rationale
sprung.
that
is
to
say--
mr.
david
p.
gauldin
--no.
the
court
essentially
explained
that
the
immediacy
for
the
collection
of
revenues
has
historically
been
an
exception
for
a
seizure
of
that
sort
for
a
tax
assessment.
and
that...
i
think
it's
paragraph
c.
i
forget.
it's
just
a
very
narrow,
little
area
where
they
actually
talk
about
the
seizure
of
the
car
in
g.m.
leasing.
mr.
david
p.
gauldin
the
court
in
g.m.
indicated
it
was
an
economic
exigency,
and
they
cited
about
three
or
four
very
old
cases
for
that
proposition,
bull
v.
united
states,
springer,
and
several
other
cases.
mr.
david
p.
gauldin
if
there
were
no
exigent
circumstances,
yes.
if
none
of
the
traditional
exceptions
applied,
yes,
they
would
have
had
to
get
a
warrant.
mr.
david
p.
gauldin
no,
you
don't
need
a
warrant
all
the
time.
if
they
actually
came
upon
him
while
he
was,
for
instance,
selling
drugs
out
of
the
car
and
they
had
probable
cause
to
believe
that
drugs
were
in
the
car--
mr.
david
p.
gauldin
--and
that
the
car
was
movable
or
may
be
moved
because
the
occupants
were
alerted,
then
i
think
the
car
exception
would
apply,
at
least
to
the
point
where
they
could--
mr.
david
p.
gauldin
--yes,
if
they
had
done
it
right
then.
yes.
mr.
david
p.
gauldin
what
the
supreme
court--
mr.
david
p.
gauldin
--i'm
sorry.
mr.
david
p.
gauldin
the
supreme
court
of
florida
i
think
said
that
there
were
no
exigent
circumstances
and
that
that
was
admitted
by
the
parties
below,
and
that
that's
why
the
car
exception
was
inapplicable.
mr.
david
p.
gauldin
i
think
delay
was
intrinsic
in
it
because
once
there's
a
delay--
mr.
david
p.
gauldin
--the
florida
supreme
court
set
out
the
dates
that
occurred
between
the
illegal
activities
that
occurred
and
the
ultimate
arrest
of
the
person
and
the
seizure
of
the
car.
mr.
david
p.
gauldin
what
they...
well,
their
reasoning
was
that
simply
the
car
exception
didn't
apply
because
there
were
no
exigent
circumstances.
mr.
david
p.
gauldin
sure.
mr.
david
p.
gauldin
well,
i
think
what
you're
talking
about
is--
mr.
david
p.
gauldin
--the
plain
view
exception,
and
under
the
plain
view
exception,
that
if
the
officers
are
in
a
public
place
and
they
come
across
either
evidence
of
a
crime
or
per
se
contraband,
that
is,
contraband
which
is
just
unlawful
for
anyone
at
any
time
to
possess,
then
they
can
seize--
mr.
david
p.
gauldin
--no.
i
think
what
we
have
here
is
derivative--
mr.
david
p.
gauldin
--yes,
if
it's
evidence
of
a
crime.
the
car--
mr.
david
p.
gauldin
--no.
the
two
that
i
understand
are
evidence
to
be
used
in
a
crime
or
contraband,
per
se
contraband.
now,
in
one
1958
plymouth
sedan,
you
stated
that
a
car,
such
as
the
car
in
this
circumstance,
where
drugs
may
have
been
sold
out
of
it...
in
that
case
i
think
it
was
alcohol
that
carried
it...
that
that
is
derivative
contraband.
that's
not
the
same
thing
as
per
se--
mr.
david
p.
gauldin
--first
place,
they
didn't
seize
it
as
evidence
of
a
crime.
they
didn't
introduce
it
below
as
evidence
of
a
crime,
and
more
importantly,
when
an
officer
seizes
evidence
of
a
crime,
an
officer
doesn't
then
take
the
evidence
back
and
proceed
to
either
sell
the
evidence
and
keep
the
proceeds
or
to
use
the
evidence
for
their
own
personal
benefit,
which
the
statute
allows.
the
statute
allows
the
seizing
agency
to
either
keep
the
car
that
they
seize
for
the
agency's
purposes
or--
mr.
david
p.
gauldin
--not
usually.
there
may
be
purposes
for
which
it
can
be.
for
instance,
cardwell
v.
lewis.
in
cardwell
v.
lewis,
they
came
and
take...
took
paint
chips
off
of
the
car
and
then
the
car
might
have
been
evidence
in
a
crime
because
their
theory
in
cardwell
v.
lewis
was
that
the
car
bumped
a
victim
off
and
hit
the
victim's
car.
and,
therefore,
it
was
evidence
of
crime,
but
that's
not
the
situation
here.
mr.
david
p.
gauldin
well,
for
ships
are...
i
hate
to
mix
analogies,
but
a
horse
of
a
different
color.
ships
are
on
international
waters.
you
have
one
option
with
a
ship,
and
that
is
to
seize
the
ship
because
if
you
don't--
mr.
david
p.
gauldin
--well,
at
least
if
it's
driven
to
california,
it's
still
within
the
continental
united
states
and
it's
much
easier
to
locate
a
car--
mr.
david
p.
gauldin
--even
then
it's
limited,
but
it's
easier
to
track
a
car
at
least
while
it's
doing
that,
through
registration
and
various
other
means,
than
it
is
to
track
a
vessel
on
international
waters,
particularly
a
vessel
owned
by
foreign
powers.
mr.
david
p.
gauldin
what
the
maritime?
other
than
it's
historic
for
maritime
because
that
was
the
only...
that
was
the
only
practical
thing
they
could
do
for
a
ship.
a
foreign
power
owned
the
ship.
if
they
didn't
bring
the
res
before
the
court,
they
could
do
nothing
except
maybe
go
to
war
with
the
other
country.
mr.
david
p.
gauldin
i
suppose
they
could,
but
again
because
of
what...
the--
mr.
david
p.
gauldin
--pardon
me.
i
didn't
hear
that.
mr.
david
p.
gauldin
yes,
yes,
yes.
which
brings
up
actually
calero-toledo.
in
calero-toledo
v.
pearson
yacht
leasing
company,
a
vessel
was
involved,
and
what
they
sought
in
calero-toledo
was
an
adversarial
pre-seizure
hearing.
and
in
calero-toledo,
you
said
that
there
were
three
reasons
as
to
why
that
they
were
not
entitled
to
an
adversarial
hearing
prior
to
seizure
of
the
ship.
the
first
reason
was
that
it
would
place
these
people
on
notice
that
the
owners
or
possessors,
in
that
case
the
possessors,
of
the
vessel...
it
would
place
them
on
notice,
and
that
they
then
might
abscond
with
the
vessel.
the
second
thing
you
were
concerned
about
in
calero-toledo
was
that
if
you
gave
them
an
adversarial
hearing,
which
we're
not
asking
for
here...
that
if
you
gave
them
an
adversarial
hearing,
the
delay
occasioned
by
that
would
allow
them
to
continue
to
use
the
vessel
for
illicit
purposes.
and
the
third
thing
you
noted
in
calero-toledo
was...
or
the
third
reason
for
which
you
decided
calero-toledo
was
that
the
disinterested
government
was
the
seizing
agency
and
not
some
interested
private...
private
agency.
taking
the
first
reason
first,
we're
not
asking
for
an
adversarial
hearing.
an
adversarial
hearing
might
put
the
person
in
the
car
that
allegedly
has
carried
illicit
contraband
on
notice,
and
might
give
him
a
reason
to
flea,
but
an
ex
parte
judicial
warrant
won't
do
that.
secondly,
there
is
certainly
no
evidence
in
this
case
that
the
government
was
concerned
about
continued
use
of
the
car
for
illicit
purposes.
if
they
had
been
concerned
about
that,
they
wouldn't
have
waited
68
to
80
days
until,
what
i
contend
based
on
the
record,
they
cavalierly
went
down
and
seized
the
car.
and
thirdly,
the
third
reason
in
calero-toledo,
the
government
is
not
disinterested
in
this
case.
the
seizing
agency
benefits
from
this.
in
harmelin
v.
michigan,
you
said
when
the
government
benefits...
when
the
government
benefits,
you
have
to
scrutinize
the
government
more
closely.
that
is
the
situation
that
exists
here.
the
government
is
going
to
benefit.
the
seizing
agency
is
going
to
benefit,
and
human
nature
being
such
it...
as
it
is,
that
is
going
to
color
the
issue
of
probable
cause.
when
a
neutral
and
detached
magistrate
makes
the
determination
of
probable
cause,
the
neutral,
detached
magistrate
is
not
only
not
engaged
in
the
competitive
enterprise
of
ferreting
out
crime,
but
the
neutral
and
detached
magistrate
is
not
going
to
get
a
piece
of
what's
seized
or
revenue
for
what's
seized.
mr.
david
p.
gauldin
no.
it
was
a
government
seizure,
but
they
said
the
disinterested
government.
mr.
david
p.
gauldin
right,
right.
mr.
david
p.
gauldin
all
i
know
is
that
in
florida
we've
got
an
interested
government
because--
mr.
david
p.
gauldin
--the
seizing
agency
is
going
to
get
the
proceeds.
mr.
david
p.
gauldin
i
don't
know
and
i'm
not
sure
how
the...
that
was
a
puerto
rican
statute
and
i'm
not
sure
exactly
what
occurred
with
the
puerto
rican
statute.
mr.
david
p.
gauldin
i
doubt
it.
mr.
david
p.
gauldin
it
may...
there's
a
difference
between
the
money
going
into
the
government's
treasury
where
it
goes
into
the
general
fund
as
opposed
to
where
the
seizing
agency,
the
officers
that
get
to
seize
it,
get
to
either
keep
the
vehicle
and,
say,
use
it
for
under
cover
purposes
or
later--
mr.
david
p.
gauldin
--yes,
yes,
although
there's...
there's
a
formula
i
think
set
up
in
the
florida
statute
as
to
which
police
agencies
and
hierarchy
and
all
that
get
a
cut
and
how,
but
the
seizing
agency
does
get
a
cut.
mr.
david
p.
gauldin
yes,
law
enforcement
does
or
law
enforcement...
the
agency
gets
to
use
the
car.
if
it
likes
your
suv
and
wants
to--
mr.
david
p.
gauldin
--they
can
keep
it.
they
don't
even
have
to
put
it
in
the
pot.
they
don't
have
to
go
sell
it.
they
can
use
it
under
the
statute.
mr.
david
p.
gauldin
no,
i
don't--
mr.
david
p.
gauldin
--no,
i
don't
know
whether
the...
the
people
that
seized
it
got
it.
no.
mr.
david
p.
gauldin
oh--
mr.
david
p.
gauldin
--yes,
very
modern,
in
fact.
in
fact,
as
i
understand
that,
that
was
the
idea
behind
the
federal
statute.
and
the
federal
statute
is
similar
to
the
florida
statute
in
this
respect,
that
is,
that
the
seizing
agency
gets
the
option
of
either...
of
either
being
able
to
keep
the...
the
goods
themselves.
mr.
david
p.
gauldin
it
is
indeed,
and
too
healthy
if
a
magistrate
hasn't
reviewed
it
to
make
sure...
the
magistrate
serves
an
auditing
function
in
the
sense
that...
you
know,
not
that
i
imply
that
the
law
officers
are
dishonest,
but
it
will
keep
them
honest.
moreover,
on
the
real
borderline
cases,
this
is
all
the
more
reason
that
you
want
a
disinterested,
neutral,
and
detached
magistrate.
finally,
the
government
i
think
relies
upon
the
watson
case
with
the
idea
that
if
you
can
seize
a
person
in
a
public
place,
why
can
you
not
seize
the
property
itself.
you
have
already
addressed
that.
the
answer
to
that,
of
course,
is
that,
first,
this
is
a
civil
forfeiture
case.
this
is
not
a
criminal
case.
you
have
certain
safeguards
of
a
constitutional
nature,
gerstein
v.
pew,
for
the
seizure
of
a--
mr.
david
p.
gauldin
--watson
was
a
criminal
case,
yes,
but
this
is
a
forfeiture
case.
mr.
david
p.
gauldin
pardon?
oh,
because
in...
you
have
civil
remedies.
you
have
civil
standards;
that
is
to
say,
probable
cause
and
all
is
the
ultimate
standard
for
the
forfeiture
of
the
vehicle.
mr.
david
p.
gauldin
there
are
for
a
person.
for
instance,
you
get
a
first
appearance
in
florida
within
24
hours.
you
get
the
right
to
counsel
if--
mr.
david
p.
gauldin
--you
can
be
arrested
without
a
warrant
for
a
felony
outside
of
your
home
under
watson,
under
the
circumstances
of
watson.
mr.
david
p.
gauldin
well,
the
watson
decision
holds
otherwise
in
that
respect--
mr.
david
p.
gauldin
--oh,
yes,
logically...
not
only
logically,
but
as
i
recall
justice
powell
said
that
logic
would
dictate
that,
but
that
history
is
against
it.
mr.
david
p.
gauldin
well,
no,
i
don't
think
you
have
to
say
that
these
other
cases
were
wrong,
if
you
mean
watson,
because
that's
dealing...
it's
different
because
in
watson
you
have
given
them
certain
constitutional
protections
such
as
the
right
to
a
first
appearance
within
24
hours
or
48
hours
at
the
most,
the
right
to
a
probable
cause
hearing
where
the
burden
is
on
the
government
to
prove
probable
cause,
the
right
to
appointment
of
counsel
if
you're
an
indigent
to
help
you
make
that
decision
when
you
don't
have
those
rights,
and
any
rights
that
you
do
have
here
are
merely
of
a
statutory
and
evanescent
nature.
mr.
david
p.
gauldin
yes,
there
is.
and,
in
fact,
in
watson,
they
specifically
cited
an
old
massachusetts
case,
rohan
v.
swain
i
think,
in
which
they
stated
that
the
public
safety
was
implicated
in
their
decision.
that's
what
they
referred
to
in...
in
basing
it
on
watson.
mr.
david
p.
gauldin
there
was
certainly
no
assertion
and
the
record
doesn't
support
any
idea
that
the
car
was
going
to
go
anywhere.
i
mean,
they
wouldn't
have
waited
68
to
80
days
if
they
had
thought
that
the
car
or
the
individual
was
going
to
be...
abscond.
mr.
david
p.
gauldin
that
i
don't
know,
but
what
i
can
say--
mr.
david
p.
gauldin
--no,
but
it
might
been
there
every
day--
mr.
david
p.
gauldin
--pardon?
mr.
david
p.
gauldin
no.
mr.
david
p.
gauldin
no,
no.
however,
the
record
does
indicate
that
he
was
arrested
at
his...
at
his
place
of
employment.
mr.
david
p.
gauldin
no,
no.
that
was
conceded
below
by
the
state,
and
in
fact,
you
can
find
that
in
the
florida
supreme
court
opinion.
mr.
david
p.
gauldin
not
that
i
know
of.
watson
dealt
with
a
felony.
mr.
david
p.
gauldin
yes,
without
a
warrant.
mr.
david
p.
gauldin
oh,
no,
no,
no.
i
wouldn't
say
that.
no,
if
that
occurred
in
his
presence.
the
problem
here,
of
course,
is,
is
th
at
what
occurred
occurred
68
to
80
days
earlier.
at
this
point,
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
thank
you
very
much.
