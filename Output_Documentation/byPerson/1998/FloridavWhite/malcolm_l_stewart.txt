mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
the
rule--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--the
rule
we're
advocating...
and
i
think
it
is
supported
by
a
number
of
this
court's
decisions...
is
that
when
items
of
personal
property
are
found
in
public
areas,
they
may
be
seized
by
law
enforcement
officials
based
on
probable
cause
without
a
prior
judicial
warrant.
now,
some
of
this
court's--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--the
driveway
is
a
close
question.
if
it
had
been
parked
in
the
owner's
garage,
for
instance,
an
area
in
which
the
owner
would
clearly
have
a
reasonable
expectation
of
privacy,
the
car
could
not
have
been
seized
on
our
view
without
a
warrant.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
our
position
on
the...
our
position
on
the
driveway,
generally
speaking,
is
that
a
driveway
is
not
within
the
curtilage,
and
therefore
the
owner
would
not
have
a
reasonable
expectation
of
privacy
in
it.
there
was
actually
a
case
in
the
seventh
circuit,
united
states
v.
redman,
that
involved
a
related
issue
in
which
law
enforcement
officials
conducted
a
search
of
trash
cans
located
at
the...
the
point
of
the
individual's
driveway
that
was
closest
to
the
house.
and
the
en
banc
seventh
circuit
split
8
to
5,
held
that
the
individual
did
not
have
a
reasonable
expectation
of
privacy
in
his
driveway.
we
think
the
same
rule
would
apply
to
seizures
of
a
vehicle
from
a
driveway,
but
in
fairness,
given
the
way
that
the
seventh
circuit
divided,
we
can't
say
that
that's
a
settled
question.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
that's
correct.
but...
but
at
any
rate,
the
dividing
line
would
be
as
to
any
particular
location,
did
the
individual
have
a
reasonable
expectation
of
privacy
in
this
place?
the
garage,
clearly
yes.
a
public
parking
lot,
clearly
no.
the
driveway
is...
is
somewhere
in
between.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
well,
i
mean,
a
car--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--a
car
is
not
per
se
dangerous.
clearly
part
of
the--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--it
is
partly
to
impose
a
punishment.
it
is
partly
out
of
a
belief
that
so
long
as
the
car
remains
in
the
hands
of
this
owner
who
has
previously
utilized
it
to
facilitate
criminal
activity,
there
is
a
danger
that
that
activity
will...
will
occur
in
the
future.
so--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--i
guess
i'd
have
a
couple
of
responses.
the
first
is
that
at
least
in
most
cases,
the
owner
can't
claim
to
be
injured
simply
by
the
fact
that
he's
allowed
to
retain
and
use
his
property
longer
than
he
might
have
been.
i
think
second
we
would
draw
an
analogy
to
warrantless
seizures
of
the
person,
warrantless
arrests.
that
is,
it's
established
law
that
a
warrantless
arrest
may
be
conducted
in
a
public
place
without
a
warrant
even
though
a
warrant
would
be
required
in
a
private
place,
and
it
might
seem
intuitively
as
though
once
police
have
probable
cause
to
believe
that
an
individual
had
committed
a
crime,
the
natural
thing
to
do
would
be
to
arrest
him
immediately
in
order
to
remove
the...
the
danger
from
the
streets.
however,
i
think
it's
generally
understood
that
there
may
be
countervailing
concerns
that
would
justify
some
form
of
delay.
the
police
might
want
to
see
whether
this
person
was
acting
in
confederation
with
others,
might
want
to
see
whether
it
could
locate
bigger
operatives
within
the
criminal
organization.
and,
therefore,
the
police
are
not
required
to
arrest
an
individual
as
soon
as
they
have
probable
cause
to
believe
that
he
has
committed
a
crime.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
well,
certainly
the...
the
primary
limitation
on
the
amount
of
delay
that
would
be
considered
reasonable
in
the
arrest
context
is
the
statute
of
limitations.
that
is,
as
a
practical
matter,
the...
the
police
couldn't
wait
so
long
to
arrest
the
individual
that
the
statute
of
limitations
had
expired.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
i...
i
think
it
would
depend
upon
the...
the
circumstances.
i
think
the
first
place
we
would
look
is
to
see
whether
the
legislature
that
had
established
the
forfeiture
statute
had
itself
made
the
determination
as
to
what
period
of
delay
was
unreasonable.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
at
some
point.
i
think
that
has
nothing,
with
respect,
to
do
with
the
warrant
requirement.
that
is,
if
for
instance--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--if,
for
instance,
florida
by
statute
had
said
property
can't
be
forfeited
based
on
its
use
in
criminal
activity
more
than
5
years
ago,
then
if
police
have
evidence
that
the
car
had
been
used
to
facilitate
narcotics
offenses
6
years
ago,
the
seizure
would
be
no
good
because
there
would
be
no
probable
cause
to
believe
that
the
property
was
forfeitable
under
the
statute.
that
would
be
so
regardless
of
whether
the
police
attempted
to
seize
the
vehicle
without
a
warrant
or
whether
they
went
to
a
magistrate
with
a
warrant.
and
as
the
chief
justice
pointed
out,
i
think
to
the
extent
that
the
court
regards
the
possibility
of
unreasonable
delay
as
a
problem,
it's
not
a
problem
that
would
be
solved
by
imposition
of
a
warrant
requirement.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
certainly
we
think...
the
rule
we
propose
is
not
automobile-specific,
but
we
certainly
think
that
the
mobility
of
automobiles
reinforces
the
general
principle
announced
in
this
court's
decisions--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--well,
what...
what
the
court
has
said
in--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--well,
the
general
principle
this
court
has
announced
is
that
items
of
personal
property
found
in
a
public
place
may
be
seized
with...
without
a
warrant,
and
one
of
the
justifications
the
court
has
given
for
that
general
rule
is
that,
at
least
in
many
instances,
the
property...
personal
property,
is
susceptible
of
being
moved
away
quickly,
and
we
think
that
is
all
the
more
true
in
the
case
of
an
automobile.
but
the...
the
rule,
as
we
propose,
as
i
say,
is
not
automobile-specific.
it
is
probably
the
type
of
rule
that
is
particularly
likely
to
be
invoked
with
respect
to
automobiles
simply
because
the
automobile
is
a
type
of
personal
property
that
is
very
often
left
in...
in
public
places.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
i
think...
i
think
that
that
is
not
true
because
the
problem
you
hypothesize
is
no
different
in
principle
from
the
problem
that
may
always
occur
when
the
police
undertake
a
warrantless
seizure
of
property
from
a
public
place.
that
is,
it
is
always
the
case
that
police
might
misjudge
the
question
of
whether
there
is
probable
cause
to
effect
the
seizure.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
well,
the--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--well,
the
further
element
would
simply
be
the
legal
determination
of
what
period
of
delay
would
be
regarded
under
the
law
as
unreasonable.
and
that
again
is
no
different
in
principle
from
the
judgment
that
police
may,
when
they
decide
whether
to
effect
a
warrantless
arrest...
that
is,
in
order
to
determine
the
existence
of
probable
cause,
they
have
to
decide
not
only
what
has
this
person
done,
but
what
does
the
law
require
or
prohibit.
and
consequently,
the
probable
cause
determination
is
inevitably
entwined
with
police
officers'
judgments
about
the
applicable
legal
standards.
they
may
get
those
wrong
and
it's
true
that
interposing
a
magistrate
might
reduce
the
incidence
of
error.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
