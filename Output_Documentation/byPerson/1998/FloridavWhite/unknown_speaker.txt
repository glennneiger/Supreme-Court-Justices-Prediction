unknown
speaker
the
way
this
came
up,
ms.
snurkowski,
was
that
evidence
was
found
in
the
ashtray
or
something
of
the
car
and
that
was
introduced
at
trial?
unknown
speaker
and
was
the
car
taken
because
it
was
forfeitable,
or
was
it
taken
just
because
he
was
arrested
and
something
had
to
be
done
with
the
car?
unknown
speaker
so,
from
the
moment
they...
they
put
the
key
in
it
and
took
it
away
it
was
because
it
was
forfeitable.
unknown
speaker
and
how
long--
--did
they
have
probable
cause
to
believe
that
the
vehicle
had
been
used
for
the
transportation
of
drugs?
unknown
speaker
did
the
officers...
has
it
been
determined
that
they
had
probable
cause
to
believe
that
the
vehicle,
which
they
seized,
had
been
used
to
transport
illegal
drugs?
unknown
speaker
and
florida
law
makes
the
car
used
for
that
purpose
to
be...
makes
it
possible
to
forfeit
it
to
the
state.
unknown
speaker
now,
you
don't
rely
on
the
g.m.
leading
corporation
case?
unknown
speaker
i
would
have
thought
that
was
the
closest
case.
you
didn't
even
mention
it.
unknown
speaker
ms.
snurkowski,
what--
unknown
speaker
--what
troubles
me
about
the
case
is
the
long
time
interval
between
the...
between
the
time
when
the...
the
police
had
probable
cause
to
believe
that
the
vehicle
had
been
used
for
a
crime
and
the
time
when
they
elected
to...
to
seize
it
as
forfeit.
i...
it
just
raises
the
possibility
of...
of
the
police
creating
a...
a
sort
of
a
evidence
depository
by
simply
identifying
a
car
and
just
leaving
that
car
out
there
for
years
and
years
until
they...
until
they
finally
determine
that
it...
it
has
evidence
that
they'd
like
to
have,
whereupon
they...
they
move
in
and
seize
it.
what...
what
assurance
is
there?
i
mean,
that
doesn't
seem
right
to
me.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
know
that,
but
that's
my
very
point.
if
you
say
they
seize
it
right
away,
i
don't
see
a
potential
for
abuse,
but
if
you
say
once
they
see
it
being
used
for
a
drug
transaction,
they
can
thereafter
just
put
in
their
file,
you
know,
license
number,
whatever,
can
be
seized
at
any
time,
and
then
wait
until
they
think
there
may
be
some
evidence
in
that
car.
and
the
real
reason
they're
seizing
it
thereafter,
or
at
least
the
real
reason
for
their
timing,
is
to
obtain
the
evidence
and
not
to...
and
not
to
forfeit
the
car.
unknown
speaker
so,
they
could
have
done
it
3
years
later,
5
years
later.
unknown
speaker
not--
unknown
speaker
--that's
exactly
what
troubles
me,
but
you...
you...
you
acknowledge
that...
that
it
could
have
been
seized
10
years
later.
unknown
speaker
would
you
apply
this,
ms.
snurkowski,
to
a
venice-type
case?
let's
say,
the...
the
city
has
an
ordinance
that
if
you
engage
in
prostitution
in
your
car,
it
will
be
forfeit,
and
then
the
police
say,
oh,
we
saw
this
guy
two,
three
times
in
the
summer.
and
then
it
gets
to
be
october,
and
his
car
is
sitting
out
there
in
a
shopping
mall.
and
they
say,
oh,
now,
well,
now,
we
can
take
the
car
because
we
saw
it
three
times
this
summer,
and
if
we
are
questioned
about
it
after,
we'll
say
that,
but
we
don't
have
to
go
before
any
magistrate
or
anything
like
that.
i
take
it
from
what
you've
said
so
far
that
that
would
also
be
okay.
unknown
speaker
there's
no
distinction
between
those
two
situations.
unknown
speaker
i'm
giving
you
a
local
ordinance--
unknown
speaker
--that
was
before
this
court
where
the
car
was
forfeit
if
it
had
been
used
for
an
act
of
prostitution.
unknown
speaker
and
i
asked
you
if
in
that
particular
case,
the
car
was
impounded
on
the
spot.
but
suppose
it
hadn't
been
taken
then,
and
the
police
said,
well,
it's
forfeit,
so
we'll
take
it
2
months
later.
and
let's
take
another
case
in
that
same
line.
let's
suppose
the
city
has
a
measure
that
says,
cars
that
are
driven
by
drunk
drivers
are
forfeit.
unknown
speaker
and
someone
is
apprehended
for
drunk
driving,
and
the
police
decide,
for
whatever
reason,
they're
not
going
to
take
the
car
that
day
and
3
months
later
they
see
it
at
the
parking
lot
of
the
place
of
employment
and
they
take
it.
unknown
speaker
i
don't
suppose
getting...
if
delay
is
a
problem,
i
don't
suppose
getting
a
warrant
would
change
things.
unknown
speaker
well,
but
would
this
issue
come...
i
mean,
the
reasonableness
of
the
search
is
going
to
be
judged
in
part
by
reference
to
the...
to
the...
or
the
reasonableness
of
the
seizure
is
going
to
be
judged
in
part
by
reference
to
the
object
of
the
seizure.
here
the
object
of
the
seizure
is...
is
punishment.
it's
an
extra
penalty
for...
for
the...
for
the...
the
act
involving
the
contraband.
and
i
think
it's
probably
accepted...
i
think
it's
accepted...
theory
today
that
the
further
in
time
between
the
act
that
is
being
punished
and
the
imposition
of
the
penalty,
the
less
effective
it
is,
the
less
reasonable
it
is
to
be
imposing
it.
so,
it
would
see
to
me
that
there's
a
fair
argument
that
the
longer
the
police
wait
without
some
kind
of...
or
the
state
waits
without
some
justification,
the
further
removed
the
seizure
becomes
from
the...
the...
a
reasonable
relationship
to
its
object.
and
at
some
point
i
suppose
that
would
affect
the
fourth
amendment
analysis.
and
i
also
assume
it
would
affect
the
fourth
amendment
analysis
if
a
warrant
were
being
applied
for.
is
that
an
illegitimate
argument?
unknown
speaker
well,
that's...
that's
right,
but
the
ultimate
question
is
the
reasonableness
of
the
search,
and
you've
got
to
have
the
probable
cause,
but
we
all
know
probable
cause
can,
in
fact,
be
dissipated
or...
or
rendered
nugatory
by
various
things
that
happen
after
you
get
it.
and
in
justice
scalia's
example,
the
5-year
wait...
i
mean,
it...
it
really
stretches
credibility
to
say
that
a
5-year
wait
without,
you
know,
some
extraordinary
excuse
that
we
don't
have
in
our
hypo,
can
reasonably
be
related
to
the
ostensibly
punitive
object
of
the
law.
and
if
that
is
so,
don't
we
in,
let's
say,
the
5-year
example...
don't
we
have
to
confront
the
unreasonableness
of
the
search
in
relation
to
its
object?
unknown
speaker
well,
would
you
agree
that
the
5-year
search
would
violate
the--
unknown
speaker
--i
keep
saying
search.
you
know--
unknown
speaker
--i
mean
seizure.
unknown
speaker
i--
unknown
speaker
--well,
it
might
affect
the--
unknown
speaker
--it
might
affect
the
probable
cause
determination
in
this
regard.
if
you
get
a
warrant,
you
have
the
judge
or
the
magistrate
makes
the
determination,
whereas
there
is
an
advantage
there.
and
secondly,
presumably
the
magistrate
would
make
it
promptly,
and
then
you'd
have
the
warrant
in
the...
in
your
desk
to
use
whenever
you
want
to
serve
it.
whereas,
if
you
wait
3
years
or
6
months
to
do
it,
then
you
have
to...
your
probable
cause
determines...
is
based
on
what
you
can
remember
of
what
happened
6
months
earlier
and
the
facts
are
less
clear
than
if
they're
established
and
the
warrant
obtained
at
the
time.
unknown
speaker
well,
again,
if...
if
delay
is
a
problem,
do
you
think
the
problem
would
be
alleviated
by
keeping
a
warrant
in
the
police
officer's
desk
for
3
years
and
then
serving
it?
unknown
speaker
yes,
but--
unknown
speaker
--but
that
also
survives
transfer
of
ownership.
say
somebody...
say
the
car
was
sold
in
the
meantime.
you'd
still
be
able
to
seize
the
car.
if
you
had
the
warrant
and
you
go
to
the
new
owner
and
say
this
is
why
i'm
seizing
it.
the
judge
decided
it
was
used
this
way.
if
you
go
to
the
new
owner
3
or
4
months
later
and
say,
well,
your
predecessor
owner
used
this
car
improperly,
we're
going
to
seize
it,
it
seems
to
me
there's
a...
factually
the
citizen
might
react
a
little
differently
to
the
service
in
the
two
cases.
unknown
speaker
but
it
wouldn't
be
a
wrongful
taking,
would
it?
unknown
speaker
i
mean,
the
new...
the
new
owner
wouldn't
have
a
defense,
would
he?
unknown
speaker
well,
but
then
it's
not
just
the
vehicle
is...
it's
not
like
the
deodand.
the
vehicle
is
not
the...
the
criminal.
unknown
speaker
by
selling
it?
unknown
speaker
you
can...
you
can
exonerate
the
vehicle
by
selling
it?
unknown
speaker
put
the
spousal
one
aside.
what
about
sale
to
an
innocent,
bona
fide
purchaser?
is
that
person
subject
to
forfeiture
or
not?
does
that
cleanse
the
car?
unknown
speaker
no,
but
the
car
had
been
used...
the
car
committed
the
crime
i
thought
under
your
theory.
unknown
speaker
and
it
ceases
to
be
an
offender
when
it's
sold.
unknown
speaker
i
don't
see
why.
is
time
for
executing
a
warrant
unlimited
in
florida?
if
a
magistrate
gives
a
warrant,
can
it
be
executed
3
months
later
or
4
months
later?
unknown
speaker
thank
you,
ms.
snurkowski.
mr.
stewart,
we'll
hear
from
you.
mr.
stewart,
would
you
mind
telling
us
exactly
what
kind
of
an
exception
to
the
warrant
requirement
you're
supporting
here?
it
certainly
isn't
clear
to
me
from
the
state's
argument--
unknown
speaker
--what
the
state's
asking
for.
unknown
speaker
so...
so,
if
the
vehicle
had
been
parked
in
the
owner's
driveway,
could
it
have
been
seized?
unknown
speaker
so,
what's
your
position
on
the
driveway
or
the
curtilage?
unknown
speaker
it
depends
on
how
much
is
left
of
the
coolidge
decision.
unknown
speaker
is
the
purpose
for
the
forfeiture,
as
you
understand
it,
because
this
particular
chattel
is...
is
a
nuisance?
it
is
a
dangerous
instrumentality.
it
should
be
removed
from
the--
unknown
speaker
--from
the
streets?
unknown
speaker
why
are
we
forfeiting?
in
order
to
impose
a
punishment?
unknown
speaker
now,
if...
if
the
latter
is
the
rationale,
then
doesn't
the
delay
that
we're
concerned
about
enter
into
the
calculus?
that
is
to
say,
if
there's
a
long,
long
delay
before
the
automobile
is
seized,
doesn't
that
indicate
that
it
is
not
such
a
dangerous
instrumentality,
that
forfeiture
should
be
used?
i'm...
i'm
trying
to...
to
find
some
standard
by
which
we
could
protect
owners
against
the
unreasonableness
that
is
caused
by
deliberate
delay,
which
can
be
used
to
harass
persons.
unknown
speaker
then
you're
saying
there's
sort
of
a
notion
of
reasonable
delay,
but
conversely
i
assume
there...
there...
there
is
the
thought
in...
in
what
you're
saying
that
there
might
be
an
unreasonable
delay
in
seizures.
unknown
speaker
okay.
well,
let's
get
to
a
case,
you
know,
a
seizure
case
like
this.
i
threw
out
the
idea
in...
in
talking
with...
with
your
colleague
that
if
the...
if
the
object
is...
is
essentially
punitive,
then
there's
a
point
at
which
the
punitive
rationale
really
begins
to
evaporate,
and
i
don't
know
when
that
point
was
reached,
but
we
thought
perhaps
if
there
had
been
a
5-year
wait,
it
would
have
evaporated.
would
you
agree
with
that?
unknown
speaker
you
know,
that
might
be
a
good
basis
for
us
to
inform
ourselves
about
contemporary
standards
of
reasonableness,
but
at
some
point
the
reasonableness
would
dissipate,
i
take
it,
on...
on
your
rationale.
unknown
speaker
i...
i...
i
agree
with
that.
unknown
speaker
do
you
rely
here
at
all
on
the
fact
that
the
car
is
a
movable
object
and--
unknown
speaker
--i
would
have
thought
the
principle
didn't
rest
at
all
on
that.
am
i
wrong?
unknown
speaker
in
this
case
where
there's
a
forfeiture
statute
because
of
the
use
of
the
vehicle.
unknown
speaker
mr.
stewart,
you
said
a
second
ago...
i
agreed
with
you
a
second
ago...
that
the
problem
of
staleness
and
dissipation
of
reasonableness
is
going
to
occur
whether
there's
a
warrant
or
whether
there
isn't,
and
i...
i
think
that's
right.
it
doesn't,
though,
i
think
follow
as...
as
you
suggested
a
second
later
that
that
makes
the
warrant
requirement
irrelevant
because
it
seems
to
me
that
if
there
is
a
warrant
requirement,
we're
going
to
have
some
magistrate
considering
at
the
time
the
warrant
is
issued,
i.e.,
prior
to
the
actual
seizure,
whether
in
fact
the
delay
has
dissipated
the
reasonableness
of
the
search
on...
on
the...
on
the
theory
on...
on
which
forfeitures
are...
are
required.
and,
therefore,
we...
we
will
have
a
situation,
if
there's
a
warrant
requirement,
in
which
some
cars
are
not
going
to
be
seized
illegally.
and
so,
it
would
seem
to
me
that
if
there
is,
in
fact,
a
dissipation
rationale,
there
is
a
good
reason,
therefore,
to...
to
have
a...
a
warrant
requirement
so
that
there
is...
there
is
some
neutral
judgment
between
the
officer
and
what
may
be
a
quite
unlawful
seizure.
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
here
we're
not
talking
about...
i
mean,
you're
quite
right.
they...
they
may
get
the
probable
cause
wrong.
but
now
we
have
yet
a...
a
further
element,
and
it's
not
a
probable
cause
kind
of
judgment.
and
therefore,
doesn't
the
further
element
at
least
provide
a
further
reason
for
saying
that...
that
a
warrant
would...
would,
in
fact,
be
helpful
in
effectuating
the
fourth
amendment?
unknown
speaker
that's
true,
maybe
we
can
get
by
without
it,
but
something
would
be
served
by
recognizing
it.
unknown
speaker
thank
you,
mr.
stewart.
mr.
gauldin,
we'll
hear
from
you.
unknown
speaker
how
do
you
distinguish
the
cooper
case
and
the
g.m.
leasing
case?
unknown
speaker
well,
but
the
court
certainly
assumed
that
the
seizure
was
appropriate.
unknown
speaker
how
about
g.m.
leasing?
unknown
speaker
well,
g.m.
leasing
involved
a
warrantless
seizure
of
a
vehicle
in
a
public
place,
and
this
court
upheld
it.
unknown
speaker
why
should
it
make
any
difference
the
fact
that
it
wasn't
a
forfeiture?
why
should
forfeiture
produce
a
special...
a
special
class
of
rules
in
connection
with
a
warrant
and
no
warrant?
unknown
speaker
well,
is
that
what...
the
court
didn't
say
that
in
g.m.
leasing.
unknown
speaker
i
mean,
you...
you
can...
you
know,
you
can
say
that
south
dakota
against
opperman,
the
inventory
case,
involved
a
van,
so
it
doesn't
cover
a
car,
but
we
don't
distinguish
cases
that
way.
unknown
speaker
well,
you
say...
you
say
the
taxing
power
is
a
constitutional
power.
do
you
think
that
the
enactment
of
a
forfeiture
statute
by
florida
is
not
a
constitutional
power?
unknown
speaker
well,
but
certainly
under
the
allocation
of
government
in
our
system,
the
florida
government
has
as
much
right
to
enact
a
forfeiture
statute
as
the
united
states
has
to
enact
a
taxing
statute,
does
it
not?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
think
the
question,
at
least
mine,
would
be,
how
could
it
be
a
reasonable
thing
to
seize
a
car
in
a
public
place
without
a
warrant
to
satisfy
a
tax
debt,
but
it
wouldn't
be
a
reasonable
thing
to
seize
an
instrumentality
of
a
crime,
the
car,
in
a
public
place?
i
mean,
how
could
the
one
be
reasonable
but
the
other
isn't?
an
instrumentality
of
a
crime
would
seem
as
historic,
as
necessary,
at
least
as
seizing
a
car
to
satisfy
a
tax
debt.
i
mean,
that's
the
same
question,
but
i'm
looking
for
the
distinction.
unknown
speaker
you
mean
you
have
to
determine
it
beyond
probable
cause?
in
other
words,
just
having
the
probable
cause
to
seize
the
car
to
satisfy
the
debt,
they
wouldn't
have
been
able
to
do
it?
unknown
speaker
no.
to
satisfy
the
debt.
i
mean,
does...
what
was
the...
is
that...
is
that
open?
i
mean,
in
other
words,
you're
saying
of
g.m.
leasing,
if
they
hadn't
had...
if
they
just
had
probable
cause,
it
would
have
been
constitutionally
forbidden?
is
that
the
point?
unknown
speaker
no,
but
the
court
in
g.m.
leasing
specifically
said
it
took
the
case
limited
to
the
fourth
amendment
issue,
and
because
there
was
probable
cause,
even
though
it
was
a
warrantless
seizure,
it
occurred
in
a
public
place
and
it
was
valid
under
the
fourth
amendment.
now,
i
mean,
the
court
didn't
get
into
this
tax
issue
at
all.
i
think
you
have
a
very
hard
time
distinguishing
the
principle
involved
in
that
case.
whether
it's
reasoned
or
not...
whether
it
did
or
didn't
get
into
it,
my
problem
is
one
of
logic
or
reason,
not
a
problem
of
precedent.
i
don't
see
the
distinction
between...
well,
you
heard
what
i
said.
unknown
speaker
what
is
the
distinction
in
your
view?
unknown
speaker
well,
we
make
a
lot
of
exceptions
to
other
constitutional
principles
in
the
tax
field,
don't
we?
i
mean--
unknown
speaker
--we...
we
allow
the
government
to
take
your
property
before
the...
the
actual
tax
judgment
is
issued,
don't
we?
unknown
speaker
they
can
take
it
now
and...
and...
you
know,
and
try
the
tax
case
later.
unknown
speaker
we
don't
generally
allow
that
in
the
criminal
law,
do
we?
unknown
speaker
maybe...
i
don't...
maybe
we
trust
tax
gatherers
more
than
we
trust
criminal
law
officials.
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
i
want
to...
i'm
sorry.
i
want
to
make
sure
i
understand
your...
your...
your
response
to
justice
breyer.
was
it
your
response,
in
effect,
as
to
g.m.
that
in
the
g.m.
case
there
had,
in
fact,
been
a
tax
judgment
and
that
that
would
have
been
the
analog
of
the
hearing
before
the
magistrate
and,
therefore,
there
was
a
kind
of
process
that
had
been
satisfied
there
going
to
the
question
of
the
reasonableness
of
the
seizure?
unknown
speaker
okay,
but
i
take
it
then...
i
just
don't
remember
this.
they...
there
had
never
been
even
an
ex
parte
judicial
proceeding
in
the
g.m.
case,
had
there
been?
unknown
speaker
notice
and
opportunity
to
do
what?
--may
not
even
know
it.
unknown
speaker
stake
out
in
front
of
the
car
and...
and
meet
the
seizure
with
armed
force?
unknown
speaker
what...
what
good
did
the
notice
do
you?
unknown
speaker
well,
notice
provides
legal
notice
in...
as...
on
a
constructive
notice
theory,
but
in
fact,
the...
the
owner
of
the
property
may
not
have
any
actual
notice
whatsoever.
i
mean,
a
filing
is
simply
a
filing.
unknown
speaker
but
this
was
not
part
of
the
court's
rationale
in
g.m.,
was
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
it
was
the...
it
was
a
fact
of
the
case,
but
the
court
did
not
explain
that
fact
as
being
essential
to
its
holding,
did
it?
unknown
speaker
so,
you're
saying
there
was
a
kind
of
economic
exigency
rationale
in
g.m.?
unknown
speaker
it
is
your
position,
as
i
understand
it,
that
a
warrant
would
have
been
necessary
even
if
that
car
had
been
seized
when
they
first
saw
it
being
used
in
an
illegal
drug
transaction,
assuming...
assuming
that
there
were
no
exigent
circumstances,
that
they...
they
had
time
to
get
a
warrant.
unknown
speaker
it
isn't
just
if
you...
if
you
don't
seize
it
right
away
when
you're
seeing
it
being
used
illegally
and
you
want
to
seize
it
later
you
need
a
warrant.
you
need
a
warrant
all
the
time.
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
well,
so
then...
then
your
answer
is
that
if...
if
they
had
seized
this
particular
car
when
they
first
saw
him
dealing
drugs
out
of
the
car,
they
could
have
done
it
without
a
warrant.
unknown
speaker
so,
it's
just...
that
certainly
wasn't
the
reasoning
of
the
supreme
court
of
florida.
the...
i
don't
think
the
supreme
court--
unknown
speaker
--i'm...
i
haven't
finished.
unknown
speaker
i
think
what
the
supreme
court
of
florida
relied
on
was
just
the
fact
that
you
need
the
warrant
regardless
of
any
delay.
unknown
speaker
yes,
and
so...
but
did
you
read
the
opinion
of
the
supreme
court
of
florida
as
relying
on
this
delay
factor?
unknown
speaker
you
say
it
was
intrinsic.
did
the
florida
supreme
court
mention
the
word
delay
in
its
opinion?
unknown
speaker
but
did
they
rely
on
that
in
their
reasoning?
unknown
speaker
can
you
help
me
with
another
thing
which
i
haven't
found--
unknown
speaker
--and
you
probably
know.
i
have
a
bell
in
my
mind
that
there
used
to
be
something
called
the
government's
power
to
seize
contraband
in
a
public
place
or
an
instrumentality
of
a
crime.
is
there
no
such
historical
tradition
that
the
government
can
take
the
instrumentality
of
a
crime
in
a
public
place?
unknown
speaker
yes.
what
am
i
talking--
unknown
speaker
--what
about
an
instrumentality
of
a
crime?
unknown
speaker
no,
but
i'm...
i'm
saying
in
terms
of
what
you
just
said,
is
it
part
of
that
tradition
that
they
could
seize
in
plain
view
an
instrumentality
of
a
crime,
which
i
guess
would
be
evidence
of
a
crime?
unknown
speaker
there's
not...
there's
no
separate
thing
for
instrumentality
of
a
crime.
unknown
speaker
no,
no.
that's
not
contraband,
but
the
reason
that
this
is
not
evidence
of
a
crime
is?
unknown
speaker
i
thought
forfeited
items
were
often
evidence
of
the
crime
and
would
often
be
sold,
if
that's
what
the
law
provides.
i
mean,
isn't
the
car
that
you're
selling
drugs
out
of
often,
if
not
here,
evidence
of
a
crime,
namely
the
crime
of
selling
drugs?
unknown
speaker
mr.
gauldin,
what
do
you
make
of
the...
the
history
which
i...
i
think
was
put
forward
in
the
government's
brief
that...
that
on
the
heels
of
the
proposal
and
the
adoption
of
the
fourth
amendment,
the
congress
of
the
united
states
passed
legislation
which,
among
other
things,
authorized
the
seizure
of...
of
ships
that
had
been
used
in
carrying
contraband
and
smuggling
and...
and...
and
it
authorized
the
seizure
without
any
warrant?
and
this
apparently
has...
was...
was
never
thought
challengeable
at
the
time
and
is,
therefore,
some
evidence
of...
of
the
extent
that
they
understood
the
warrant
requirement
of
their...
their...
their
new...
their
new
search
and
seizure
provision
to...
to
cover.
unknown
speaker
well,
yes,
the
ship
can...
can
leave
the
harbor.
the
car
can,
you
know,
be
driven
to
california.
it
seems
to
me
that
there's
a
pretty
good
analogy
there.
unknown
speaker
mexico.
[laughter]
baja
california.
that's
what
he
meant.
unknown
speaker
do...
do
you
have
another
basis
for
distinguishing
that
practice?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
would
have
supposed
that
if
there
was
a
ship
in
the
harbor
that
had
been
shown
to...
to
have
goods
being
smuggled
in,
that
they
could
have
gotten
a
warrant
for
it.
unknown
speaker
in
any
case,
your
argument
is
that
the
ship
involves
again
a...
a
justification
of
exigency
and
that
that's
not
present
with
the
car?
unknown
speaker
that
the
seizure
of
the
ship
without
a
warrant
rests
on
a
justification
of
exigency,
whereas
the
seizure
of
a
car
under
a
statute
like
this
does
not.
unknown
speaker
why...
why
was
that
not
the
situation
in
calero-toledo?
that
was
not
a
government
seizure?
unknown
speaker
oh,
that
was
a
disinterested
government.
unknown
speaker
how
do
you
tell
the
one
from
the
other?
unknown
speaker
i
see.
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
who
was
going
to
get
the
proceeds
from
the
ship
in...
in
calero-toledo?
unknown
speaker
you
think
maybe
it
was
going
to
be
distributed
as
a
tax
refund
to
the
populace
at
large?
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
i
don't
see
any
difference
between
that
case
and
this
one.
i
think
it
very
likely
that
the
money
was
going
to
go
into
the
government's
treasury.
unknown
speaker
i
see.
well,
do
they...
i
know
this
happens
in
some
cases.
i
don't
know
if
it's
in
florida.
but
if
they
sell
the...
the
seized
vehicle,
does
the
money
go
into,
in
effect,
an
appropriation
account
for
the
police
agency
itself?
do
they...
can
they
fund
themselves
out
of
this?
unknown
speaker
but
it's
law
enforcement
that
gets
funded,
in
effect,
with
this
money.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
and
i...
do
you
know...
i
mean,
i
think...
i
think
i
can
suspect
the
correct
answer,
but
i'll
ask
anyway.
do
you
know
whether
there
was
any
such
scheme
as
this
in
place
in...
in
the
1790s
in
the
instance
of
the
ship
seizure
that
i
was
talking
with
you
about
earlier--
unknown
speaker
--whether
the--
unknown
speaker
--that's
probably
a
modern
notion
i
would
imagine--
unknown
speaker
--that
you...
that
you
fund
your
agency
out
of
the
proceeds
of...
of
your
forfeitures.
unknown
speaker
that's
a
healthy
incentive
to
enforce
the
law,
don't
you--
unknown
speaker
--you
say
that
watson...
watson
was
a
criminal
case--
unknown
speaker
--and
does...
why
is
that
different?
unknown
speaker
but
you
would
think
perhaps
that
there
would
be
more
protections
against
seizure
in
a
criminal
case
than
there
would
be
in
a
civil
case.
unknown
speaker
but
you...
but
you
can
be
arrested
without
a
warrant.
unknown
speaker
so,
if
the
police
need
a
warrant
to...
to
arrest,
in
effect,
or
seize
a
car
in
a
public
place
where
they
have
probable
cause
to
know
that
the...
the
car
was
an
instrumentality
of
a
crime,
i
would
certainly
think
a
fortiori
they
would
need
a
warrant
to
arrest
a
person
in
a
public
place,
although
they
have
probable
cause
to
believe
that
the
person
is
or
has
engaged
in
a
crime.
unknown
speaker
no,
no.
i'm
talking
about
logic.
unknown
speaker
all
right.
so,
what
we
do
if
we
decided
in
your
favor,
we
would
then
have
to
say
that
these
other
cases
were
wrong
but
simply
established
the
law
through
precedent.
unknown
speaker
but
isn't
there
a...
a
public
safety
rationale
behind
the...
the
warrantless
arrest
which
does
not
apply
here?
unknown
speaker
and
was
there
also
a
factor
that
a
person
is
mobile
and
here
there
was
no
assertion
that
this
car,
as
the
cars
that
are
under
the
car
exception,
might
go
across
the
border?
i
mean,
the
car
had
been
there
and
visible
and
able
to
be
taken
for
some
period
of
time.
unknown
speaker
how
long
had
the
car
been
in
the
parking
lot
where
it
was
seized?
unknown
speaker
it
hadn't
been
there
80
days,
had
it?
unknown
speaker
nothing
in
the
record
indicates
it
was
there
for
80
days.
unknown
speaker
nothing
in
the
record
indicates
it
was
there
for
80
days.
unknown
speaker
nothing
in
the
record
indicates
that
the
police
had
it
under
surveillance
for
80
days,
does
it?
unknown
speaker
and
there
was
no
suspicion
that
at
that
time
the
car
was
carrying
contraband.
the
crack
happened
to
turn
up--
unknown
speaker
--have
we
held
that
you
can
have
an
arrest
of
a
person
without
a
warrant
for
an
offense
less
than
a
felony?
unknown
speaker
so,
you...
you...
you
can
argue
that
this
is
more
analogous
to
a
misdemeanor
arrest
than
it
is
to
a
felony
arrest,
the
seizing
of
property
that
is...
that
is
forfeited.
unknown
speaker
do
you
say
that
we
have
not
held
that
a
police
officer
can
arrest
someone
without
a
warrant
for
a
misdemeanor
committed
in
the
presence
of
the
officer?
unknown
speaker
thank
you,
mr.
gauldin.
ms.
snurkowski,
you
have
4
minutes
remaining.
