ms.
carolyn
m.
snurkowski
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
today
the
state
is
here
before
the
court
seeking
to
have
the
florida
supreme
court
opinion
in
white
v.
state
reversed
based
on
that
court's
determination
that
a
requirement
under
florida
law
and
under
the
fourth
amendment
to
the
united
states
constitution
mandates
that
there
be
a
neutral
magistrate
sought
and
a
warrant
obtained
prior
to
the
seizure
of
a
vehicle
under
the
florida
contraband
forfeiture
act.
the
state
would
direct
its
attention
to
cases,
in
particular,
cooper,
in
particular,
united
states
v.
watson
as
controlling
in
this
case.
the
solicitor
general
will
focus
on
the
applicability
of
horton
to
this
case
and
the
plain
view
theory
that
has
been
presented
in
some
of
the
briefs.
ms.
carolyn
m.
snurkowski
yes,
mr.
chief
justice.
what
happened
on
october
14th,
1993,
the
defendant
was
at
his
place
of
business.
the
officer
pierce
and
officer
stewart
had
the
ability
to
go
there
under
a
search
warrant
to
arrest
him
for
unrelated
drug
charges.
at
that
time,
he
was
placed
under
arrest.
his
keys
were
taken
from
him.
the
keys
to
his
car,
which
was
in
a
parking
lot,
which
was
the
sam's
parking
lot...
the
car
was
taken,
driven
to
the
task
force
community.
it
was
not
searched.
it
was
just
seized
at
that
point.
it
was
taken
to
the
task
force
facility.
at
that
point
it
was
searched.
two
crack
cocaine
rocks
were
found
wrapped
in
toweling
in
the
ashtray
of
the
car.
ms.
carolyn
m.
snurkowski
this
was
not
incident
to
a
lawful
arrest
and
it
was
not
because
of
anything
more
than
the
officers'
belief
that
it
was
under
forfeiture.
there
had
been
three
previous
occasions
when
mr.
white
was
seen
dealing
drugs
out
of
the
car,
and
under
florida
statutes
920...
32.701
through
04,
the
state
has
the
ability
to
seek
forfeiture
of
a
vehicle
that's
used
as
an
instrumentality.
ms.
carolyn
m.
snurkowski
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
carolyn
m.
snurkowski
i'm
sorry.
i
didn't
hear
the
first
part
of
your
question.
ms.
carolyn
m.
snurkowski
yes,
your
honor.
there
had
been
three
previous
occasions
where
one
of
these
officers
had
personally
observed
and
there
were
videotapes
of
the
defendant
actually
selling
drugs
out
of
the
car.
ms.
carolyn
m.
snurkowski
subject
to
forfeiture.
ms.
carolyn
m.
snurkowski
yes,
we
do,
your
honor.
ms.
carolyn
m.
snurkowski
i
believe
that
that
has
been
mentioned
in
the
other
briefs.
but,
yes,
in
looking
at
this
case,
we
believe
that
that
is
a
pertinent
and
germane
case
to
this
one.
the
reason
the
state
started
out
with
the
cooper
decision
is
it's
believed
that
that
in
that
case
there,
the
subject
matter
of
scrutiny
was
the
search
following
the
seizure,
and
the
seizure
at
that
point
was...
was
under
a
forfeiture
statute
and
was
not
in
question.
it
seems
reasoned
and
followed
that
if
in
this
instance
where
the
inventory
search
is
not
in
question
in
this
instance,
that
both
the
seizure
and
the
search
are
satisfied...
satisfies
the
fourth
amendment
with
regard
to
practices
engaged
in
by
the
florida
authorities.
ms.
carolyn
m.
snurkowski
yes.
ms.
carolyn
m.
snurkowski
well,
first
of
all,
in
this
instance,
all
of
the
activities
that
occurred
that
generated
the
need
or
the
ability
by
the
state
to
forfeit
occurred
prior
to
any
activity
going
on
with
regard
to
this...
this
last
event.
it
wasn't
that
the
car
was
suddenly
sitting
out
there
doing
nothing.
there
had
been
three
occasions
when
mr.
white
was
selling
drugs
out
of
his
car.
the
probable
cause
that
generated...
was
generated
by
that...
was
to
forfeit
the
car.
it
was
not
to
ascertain
or
have
probable
cause
to
seize
the
car.
in
fact,
the
car
couldn't
have
been
seized
at
the
moment
they
saw
the
drugs
being
dealed--
ms.
carolyn
m.
snurkowski
--well,
in
all
due
respect,
i
think
that
under
whren,
this
court
has
indicated
that
we
are
looking
at
an
objective
standard
as
opposed
to
a
subjective
standard.
the
police
officers
have
a
legitimate
basis
under
florida's
contraband
statute
to
seize
the
vehicle.
ms.
carolyn
m.
snurkowski
well,
there
is
certainly
case
law
that
reflects
that
the
time...
the...
the...
it
seems
to
me
that
the
probable
cause
doesn't
become
stale,
doesn't
change
because
the
vehicle
itself
is
the
criminal
act--
ms.
carolyn
m.
snurkowski
--the
fact
that
it
was
used.
ms.
carolyn
m.
snurkowski
well,
it
probably
could
have
been,
but
the...
the
likelihood
of
it
passing
scrutiny
with
regard
to
the
ultimate
review
of
the
search
itself...
we
are
talking
about
whether
you
have
to
go
to
a
neutral
magistrate
to
seize
the
car.
it's--
ms.
carolyn
m.
snurkowski
--yes,
i
believe--
ms.
carolyn
m.
snurkowski
--i...
i
believe
that
the
instrumentality
itself,
the
car
is
what
is
the
offender
here,
not
the
actions.
the
actions
may
precipitate
that
the
car
is
being
used,
and
it
may
be
incident.
and,
in
fact,
under
florida
statute
there
is
a
defense
to
incidental
or
accidental
use
by
the
vehicle
and
therefore
it's
not
subject
to
forfeiture.
but
if
it's...
if
it's
part
of
the
criminal
conduct,
and
in
this
instance
perhaps
where
one
is
soliciting
for
prostitution,
the
car
in
and
of
itself
might
not
be--
ms.
carolyn
m.
snurkowski
--i'm
sorry.
ms.
carolyn
m.
snurkowski
right.
ms.
carolyn
m.
snurkowski
right.
ms.
carolyn
m.
snurkowski
well,
i
think
it
depends
upon...
again,
we're...
the
case
before
the
court
is
the
forfeiture
act
with
regard
to
the
drugs
and
other
criminal
endeavors.
but
to
expand
it
to
the
argument
or
the
suggestion
that
you
have
made
that
it
has
do
with
drunk
driving,
as
we
have
seen
news
stories
out
of...
coming
out
of
the
state
of
new
york,
that
very
well
may
be
a
basis
if,
in
fact,
it's
the
instrumentality
used
to...
for
help
and
involved
in
the
crime
itself.
ms.
carolyn
m.
snurkowski
absolutely.
and--
ms.
carolyn
m.
snurkowski
--i
think
there
is
probably
some
truth
to
the
fact
that
time
could
pass
along,
but
it
doesn't
mean
that
the
probable
cause
in
any
way
deteriorates.
it
may
be
other
factors--
ms.
carolyn
m.
snurkowski
--yes,
your
honor.
and
in
fact,
i
don't--
ms.
carolyn
m.
snurkowski
--it
very
well--
ms.
carolyn
m.
snurkowski
--right.
seizure.
ms.
carolyn
m.
snurkowski
it
very
well...
it
very
well
may
be,
but
it
doesn't
impact
with
regard
to
the
probable
cause.
it
impacts
upon
the
reasonableness.
ms.
carolyn
m.
snurkowski
and
that
certainly
would
be
something
that
would
be
under
scrutiny
upon
a
challenge
to
the
validity--
ms.
carolyn
m.
snurkowski
--of
the
seizure
and
ultimate
search.
ms.
carolyn
m.
snurkowski
that's
true,
but
the
underpinnings
of
the
probable
cause
here
is
that
some...
an
instrumentality,
a
car,
was
used
during
the
course
of
the
criminal
endeavor.
that's
the
basis
upon
which
the
probable
cause
arises
under
the
florida
statute.
ms.
carolyn
m.
snurkowski
no,
your
honor,
and
that
was
what
i
was
trying
to
get
to.
the...
the
point
is
that
on
the
facts
of
this
case
and
i
believe
most
of
the
facts
as
presented
in
the
hypotheticals,
a
magistrate
would
have
issued
a
warrant
the
next
day
or
10
days
or
100
days
because
it
was...
if
there's
probable
cause
to
believe
that
that
vehicle
in
fact
was
used
during
the
course
of
a
criminal
endeavor,
to
wit,
selling
drugs,
that...
that
car
cannot
wipe--
ms.
carolyn
m.
snurkowski
--itself
away
of
the
crime.
ms.
carolyn
m.
snurkowski
but
in
fact...
but
in
fact
under
the
statute,
there
is
a
very
speedy
ability
to
have
redress
with
regard
to
wrongful
taking
of
the
vehicle,
and
in
fact,
under--
ms.
carolyn
m.
snurkowski
--well--
ms.
carolyn
m.
snurkowski
--yes,
because
under
the
statute,
it
applies
to
those
individuals
who...
under
the
florida
statute,
it
applies
to
those
individuals
who
are
innocent
with
regard
to--
ms.
carolyn
m.
snurkowski
--well,
it...
it
can
be
wiped
clean
in...
in--
ms.
carolyn
m.
snurkowski
--pardon
me?
ms.
carolyn
m.
snurkowski
well,
under
the
florida
statute,
it
shows...
we
have
a
provision
that
says,
for
example,
a
spousal
ownership.
if
that
person
can
demonstrate
that
they
had
no
knowledge
with
regard
to
that,
that
the
car
will
not
be
forfeited.
so,
there
are
provisions
that
protect,
but
that
doesn't
mean
to
say
that
because
we
put
provisions
that
protect,
that
the
instrumentality
suddenly
is
cleansed.
it
just
means
that
we're
not
going
to
forfeit
because
this
is
not
the
car
that--
ms.
carolyn
m.
snurkowski
--the
car
is
not
cleansed.
what
happens
is
that
the
purpose
for
forfeiture
has
changed
because
it's
no...
the
car
no
longer
is
being
forfeited
because
somebody
engaged
in
a
criminal
endeavor,
if
an
innocent
person
now
owns
that
car.
that
person
didn't
do
anything
to
that.
ms.
carolyn
m.
snurkowski
that's
right.
under
forfeiture
theory,
the
crime...
when
the
crime
occurs,
the
car
becomes
an
offender
or
offendee--
ms.
carolyn
m.
snurkowski
--well,
it
doesn't
cease
to
be
that,
but
it
certainly...
it
has...
it
has
less
basis
for
support
for
the
ultimate
forfeiture
of
that
vehicle.
ms.
carolyn
m.
snurkowski
there's
no
specific
provision
that
allows
for
a
time
limitation.
thank
you.
ms.
carolyn
m.
snurkowski
thank
you,
your
honor.
forfeiture
is
a
process.
it's
not
just
the
activity
of
seizing
the
car,
and
the
florida
statute
is
very
clear
with
regard
to
that.
the
seizure
of
the
vehicle
commences
forfeiture
proceedings.
it
is
not
the
end
all.
so,
to
suggest
that
somehow
the
police
are
acting
beyond
the
pale
and
doing
something
that
they
shouldn't
do
because
there's
going
to
be
monies
coming
to
the
agency
at
some
point
i
believe
is
not
a
sound
basis
to
suggest
that
forfeiture
is
not
a
valid
basis
upon
which
to
be
able
to
seize
without
a...
a
warrant.
watson
i
believe
is
very
controlling
with
regard
to
this
instance
whether
a
individual,
who
has
committed
a
felony
and
there's
probable
cause
by
the
police
officers
to
arrest
or,
in
fact,
he
sees
the
individual
committing
a
misdemeanor
in
his
presence,
i
don't
believe
that
there's
a
dime's
worth
of
difference,
to
be
very
frank,
between
that
and
the
bottom
line
of
seizing
a
vehicle
where
the
officers
understand,
believe,
and
have
knowledge
and
probable
cause
based
on
that
knowledge,
that
this
vehicle
is
an
instrumentality
in
a
criminal
endeavor.
in
this
particular
instance,
the
police
did
not
just
willy-nilly
go
down
to
the
sam's
parking
lot
and
seize
the
car.
they
had
an
arrest
warrant
and
they
arrested
mr.
white
on
other
charges,
on
other
narcotics
charges.
and
as
a
part
of
that,
they
seized
the
vehicle
because
they
had
the
requisite
probable
cause
based
on
earlier
conduct
by
this
defendant.
the
state
would
submit
that
there's
nothing
been
done
during
this
event,
nor
any
other
event,
that
similarly
tracks
the
ability
of
the
government
to
go
and
seize
vehicles
without
a
pre-seizure
warrant.
in
fact,
that
is
done
throughout
this
country
on
a
daily
basis
based
on
the
federal
forfeiture
acts
and
other
state
forfeiture
acts.
and,
in
fact,
many
states
and
many...
in
particular,
other
supreme
courts
and
the
federal
government
have
relied
heavily
with
regard
to
the
applicability
of
the
cooper
decision,
of
the
applicability
of
watson,
and
of
g.m.--
and
with
regard
to
our
g.m.
argument,
the
reason...
one
of
the
reasons
why
i
believe
that
we
did
not
rely
so
heavily
on
that
was
the
second
prong
of
this,
was
that
we
want
to
make
sure
that
the...
the
court
understood
that
we're
not
talking
about
real
property.
there
was
a
discussion
with
regard
to
the
florida
supreme
court
about
florida
department
of
law
enforcement
versus
real
property
in
their
opinion,
and
that
case
dealt
with
real
property.
we
are
talking
about
personal
property
such
as
vehicles
and
other
instrumentalities
of
criminal
act,
not
real
property
which
is
an
exception
under
the
florida
statutes
with
regard
to
forfeiture.
thank
you.
