mr.
richard
a.
cordray
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
represent
the
marshals
service
officers
in
wilson
and
all
the
officials
in
hanlon.
there
are
two
issues
in
these
cases:
the
constitutional
issue
itself
and
the
further
issue
of
whether
in
any
event
these
officers
should
be
held
personally
liable
for
money
damages
when,
at
the
time
they
acted,
the
law
was
not
clearly
established
and
it
was
not
apparent
that
their
conduct
violated
the
fourth
amendment.
we
submit
that
however
the
court
decides
the
constitutional
issue
is
a
matter
of
first
impression
in
this
case.
mitchell
v.
forsyth
compels
the
result
that
qualified
immunity
should
be
upheld
for
these
officers
here.
turning
first
to
the
constitutional
issue,
as
framed
by
the
court,
the
issue
is
whether
law
enforcement
officials
violate
the
fourth
amendment
when
they
permit
members
of
the
news
media
to
accompany
them
in
order
to
observe
and
report
on
their
execution
of
a
warrant.
we
submit
that
it
would
be
wrong
to
erect
a
per
se
rule
that
in
all
circumstances
such
conduct
is
improper.
certainly
to
the
extent
that
the
search
in
the
hanlon
case
involved
open
fields
or
had
the
arrest
of
dominic
wilson
occurred
in
a
public
place,
it
would
be
unproblematic
that
the
media
accompanied
the
officers
and
observed
and
reported
on
their
execution
of
a
warrant.
as
a
larger
matter,
moreover,
there
are
many
instances
throughout
this
country
every
day
in
which
third
parties
accompany
officers
as
they
execute
warrants,
and
this
has
been
true
since
the
inception
of
bench
warrants.
there
are
many
different
circumstances.
they
may
be
there
to
join
in
performing
the
search
or
the
seizure
in
assistance
of
the
officers.
they
may
assist
the
officers
in
other
more
tangential
ways:
provide
clerical
help,
translating,
identifying
evidence.
they
may
also
help
facilitate
the
law
enforcement
objectives
that
are
served
by
procuring
and
implementing
the
warrant
itself.
mr.
richard
a.
cordray
your
honor,
as
reflected
in
the
justice
department
policy
in
the
u.s.
attorneys'
manual
in
effect
at
the
time
of
the
hanlon
search
and--
mr.
richard
a.
cordray
--since
been
amended.
that's
correct.
yes.
mr.
richard
a.
cordray
no.
modified.
modified
with
respect
to
the
execution
of
a
warrant.
mr.
richard
a.
cordray
it...
it
still
is
the
case...
this
is
set
forth
in
the
appendix
to
the
blue
brief
in
the...
in
the
hanlon
case...
that
law
enforcement
officers
may
assist
the
news
media
in
reporting
on
and
observing
and
videotaping--
mr.
richard
a.
cordray
--it
doesn't
speak
to
that,
but
it
has
now
specified
that
they
should
not
facilitate
media
accompaniment
in
the
execution
of
a
warrant,
your
honor.
however,
at
the
time
the
policy
certainly
countenanced
such
conduct
and,
in
fact,
encouraged
it.
however,
the
purposes
served
are
the
same
ones
that
were
served
as...
as
stated
in
that
policy,
which
are
to
promote
the
aims
of
law
enforcement
by
deterring
criminal
conduct
and
by
enhancing
public
confidence.
mr.
richard
a.
cordray
this
court
has
held
that
the
fourth
amendment
doesn't
require
a
least
intrusive
means
test
as
long
as
the
conduct
is
reasonable.
mr.
richard
a.
cordray
well
certainly,
your
honor,
to
the
extent
that
the
media
are
permitted
to
give
a
firsthand
objective
account
of
the
actual
events,
that
facilitates
accurate
reporting
on
law
enforcement
functions,
and
it
may
be
quite
helpful
in
preventing
abuses
in
instances.
mr.
richard
a.
cordray
no,
your
honor,
and
no
one
contends
that
the
media
should
have
special
privileges
here.
mr.
richard
a.
cordray
many
law
enforcement
departments
around
the
country
do
have
a
public
ride-along
program
that
will
permit
public
to
ride
along
with
officers
and
observe--
mr.
richard
a.
cordray
--well,
there
are
a
variety
of
such
programs,
and
i'm
sure
that
in
various
circumstances--
mr.
richard
a.
cordray
--well,
yes,
your
honor.
the
marshals
service
policy
at
issue
in
the
wilson
case
in
place
at
the
time
clearly
countenanced...
page
7
of
the
joint
appendix--
mr.
richard
a.
cordray
--yes,
your
honor.
we...
we
have--
mr.
richard
a.
cordray
--we
have...
we
have
cited
to
the
court
the
fletcher
case
from
the
florida
supreme
court
which
recognized,
as
a
matter
of
common
usage
and
custom
at
the
common
law
as
of
1972,
that
it
was
common
practice
to
allow
media
to
accompany
police--
mr.
richard
a.
cordray
--even
into
private
property
or
residence--
mr.
richard
a.
cordray
--that's
where
i
beg
to
differ.
the
purpose
of
a
public
ride-along
program,
as
with
the
media
ride-along
program,
is
to
serve
law
enforcement
purposes.
that's
the
whole...
it's
not
merely
for
someone's
entertainment
value
or
to
satisfy
someone's
curiosity.
mr.
richard
a.
cordray
i...
i
can't
speak
to
that
one
way
or
another,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
a.
cordray
i
can
speak
to
the
fact
that
it
was
recognized
at
the
common
law
as
of
25
years
ago,
that
it
was
common
practice
around
the
country
for
the
media
to
accompany--
mr.
richard
a.
cordray
--i...
i
can't
speak
to
that
one
way
or
another,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
a.
cordray
i
believe
that's
right,
but
i
wouldn't
want
to
concede
that--
mr.
richard
a.
cordray
--i
know
that
there
are
public
ride-along
programs.
i'm
sure
they
have
different
components.
i
don't
know
for
certain
that
they
contemplate
entry
into
a
home,
but
they
do
contemplate
the
public
attending
or
accompanying
officers.
mr.
richard
a.
cordray
i'm
certain
that
they
are,
just
as
a
matter
of
common
sense
practice
and
to
avoid
potential
lawsuits
and
the
like.
i
can't
at
firsthand
speak
to
law
school
programs
around
the
country,
but
i
do
believe
that
they
are
fairly
common.
mr.
richard
a.
cordray
that's
correct.
there
was
no
execution
of
the
warrant
in
the
home.
the
only
entry
into
the
home
was
accompanying
mr.
berger--
mr.
richard
a.
cordray
--by
consent
to
explain
the
situation
to
his
wife
so
there
wouldn't
be
a
misunderstanding.
mr.
richard
a.
cordray
correct.
mr.
richard
a.
cordray
the
search
in
the
hanlon
case
was
executed
in
two
different
places,
in
open
areas
on
the
ranch,
which
i
think
fairly
clearly
would
fall
within
the
open
fields
doctrine,
although
it
is
private
property,
and
at
the
same
time
in
outbuildings.
and
the
record,
as...
as
far
as
i
can
tell,
does
not
disclose
for
certain
one
way
or
the
other
whether
they
were
within
the
curtilage
or
not.
but
they
may
well
be.
i
think
there
is
a
constitutional
argument
that
they
are
open
fields--
mr.
richard
a.
cordray
--i
think
that's
right,
both
ways,
by
the
district
court
in
our
favor
and
by
the
court
of
appeals--
mr.
richard
a.
cordray
--i
don't
believe
the
court
has
specified
all
the
details
of
that,
no.
mr.
richard
a.
cordray
as
i
understand
the
open
fields
doctrine,
it
would
because
the
court
has
said
that
searches
of
open
fields,
even
though
they
may
be
private
property,
do
not
implicate
the
fourth
amendment.
and,
therefore,
i...
i
think
that
that's
correct,
although
again
i
don't
believe
the
court
specifically
addressed
that.
mr.
richard
a.
cordray
that's
correct.
mr.
richard
a.
cordray
i
think
it's
an
open
factual
issue
in
this
case,
and
i
think
what's
germane
to
the
issue
that
the
court
has
framed
is
that
there
was
no
execution
of
a
warrant
in
a
home
in
that
case.
and
if
this
court
is
particularly
concerned
with
execution
of
a
warrant
in
a
home,
that
would
not
be
implicated
on
the
facts
of
the
hanlon
case.
mr.
richard
a.
cordray
as
here,
the
police
are
operating
pursuant
to
a
valid
warrant,
and
it's
been
determined
in
both
cases
that
they
were
properly
executing
the
warrant.
in
a...
in
a
situation
where
the
police
are
looking
through
a
window,
they
may
or
may
not
have
right
to
be
at
the
vantage
point
they're
at--
mr.
richard
a.
cordray
--it
may.
it
may,
and
again
i
think
that's
an
open
factual
issue
in
this--
mr.
richard
a.
cordray
--i
think
you
would
not
need
a
warrant,
although
perhaps
in
an
abundance
of
caution
to
avoid
any
problems
that
might
arise
in
later
litigation
or
motion
to
suppress,
certainly
the
better
practice
would
be
for
the
police
to
obtain
a
warrant,
as
they
did
here.
but
in
any
event,
to
return
to
the--
mr.
richard
a.
cordray
--no,
but
certainly--
mr.
richard
a.
cordray
--i
think
that's
correct,
but
that's
why
i
thought
it
was
important
to
emphasize
the
court
should
not
erect
a
per
se
rule
against
media
accompaniment
in
all
circumstances
where
a
warrant
is
involved.
in
many
instances,
a
warrant
would
be
executed
in
such
a
way
as
to
not
even
implicate
fourth
amendment
interests.
it
might
be
executed
in
a
public
place.
it
might
be
executed
in
an
area
of
open
fields.
certainly
the
nature
of
the
intrusion
is
much
reduced
in
that
setting,
and...
and
across
the
board,
across
the
spectrum
of
different
possible
settings,
each
of
them
somewhat
fact-specific,
each
of
them
raising
maybe
a
greater
or
lesser
extent
of
intrusion,
those
are
factors
that
would
be
relevant
in
trying
to
draw
this
balance.
mr.
richard
a.
cordray
correct.
mr.
richard
a.
cordray
i
think
it's...
it's
more...
more
beneficial
in
certain
respects
and
it's
more
of
a
concern
in
certain
respects.
the
court--
mr.
richard
a.
cordray
--perhaps.
the
court
framed
the
issue
in
terms
of
media,
but
in
general
the
court...
the
court
has...
has...
has
never
addressed
the
issue
of
any
third
parties
coming
along.
we
don't
contend
that
the
media
have
a
special,
privileged
constitutional
right
of
access.
they
do
not
under
this
court's
case,
but
they
as
surrogate
for
the
public
could
potentially
be...
they
should
not
be
discriminated
against.
it's
not
as
though
the
media
should
be
the
one
individual
not
permitted
to
do
what
private
individuals
might
otherwise
be
permitted
to
do--
mr.
richard
a.
cordray
--yes,
your
honor.
there
are
a
variety
of
practices
where
third
parties
are
permitted
to
accompany
police
and
have
been
thought
to
be
without
problematic
discussion
reasonable
under
the
fourth
amendment.
mr.
richard
a.
cordray
in
many
cases,
that's
true,
but
there
are
also
a
number
of
instances
in
which
that
really
can't
be
maintained.
for
example,
in
the
hanlon
case,
the
assistant
prosecutor,
kris
mclean,
accompanied
the
officers.
it
wasn't
contended
that
he
was
helping
to
execute
the
particular
search,
but
he
was
there
serving
the
same
objectives
for
which
the
officers
had
sought
and
obtained
a
search
warrant
in
the
first
place
to
enforce
the
federal
wildlife
laws.
he
was
probably
going
to
be
prosecuting
any
charges
that
might
be
brought,
and
it
was
thought
it
would
useful
for
him
to
attend
and
observe
the
execution
of
the
warrant.
mr.
richard
a.
cordray
i
think
that
certainly
be
reasonable,
although
it's
not
contended
that
that
was
the
case
here
in
this
case.
but
again,
i
think
what's
important
is
under
michigan
v.
summers
is
that
the
court
needs
to
apply
a
reasonableness
standard.
i
think
that's
agreed
among
the
parties
here.
the
specific
requirements
of
the
fourth
amendment
don't
speak
directly
to
this
other
than
the
reasonableness
clause,
and
it's
a
balance
between
the
nature
of
the
intrusion
on
the
one
hand
and
the
objectives
served
by
the
practice
on
the
other
hand.
mr.
richard
a.
cordray
i
think
that's
an
important
factor.
mr.
richard
a.
cordray
i
think
that...
that
is
the
one
side
of
the
balance
in
all
of
these
cases.
the
other
side
of
the
balance
may
change.
it
may
be
of
greater
concern,
of
lesser
concern
in
various
circumstances,
but
i
think
that's
correct,
your
honor.
that
would
be
the
balance--
mr.
richard
a.
cordray
--again,
we
think--
mr.
richard
a.
cordray
--we
think
in
the
hanlon
case
that's...
that's
correct,
in
particular
because
they
were
merely
searching
outbuildings
and
open
areas.
they
were...
they
were...
there
was
a
search
that
did
not
involve
criminal
conduct
that
appeared
to
involve
any--
mr.
richard
a.
cordray
--i
think
that
there
the
fact...
the
fact
of
entering
a
residence
is
a...
is
obviously
an
important
consideration.
it
is...
it
is
a
consideration
that
raises
the
nature
of
the
intrusion
and
magnifies
it.
so,
certainly
that's
a
concern.
on
the
other
hand--
mr.
richard
a.
cordray
--yes.
mr.
richard
a.
cordray
that's
correct.
mr.
richard
a.
cordray
in
our
view,
we
would
suggest
that
in
any
case
where
we're
talking
about
execution
of
an
arrest
warrant,
not
involving
a
search
that's
going
to
be
into
private
papers
or
personal
effects,
we
can
pretty
much
adopt
a
general
rule--
mr.
richard
a.
cordray
--that's
right.
that
execution
of
an
arrest
warrant
is
going
to
be
generally
reasonable
to
allow
medic
accompaniment
because
an
arrest
is
a
public
event.
mr.
richard
a.
cordray
i
think
that
it...
it's
fairly
clear
that
as
we
proceed
along
a
spectrum
here,
a
search
warrant
in
the
home
is
more
problematic
than
an
arrest
warrant.
i
think
it's
more
problematic
than
a
search
of
outbuildings,
certainly
more
problematic
than
a
search
of
open
fields.
yes,
and
that--
mr.
richard
a.
cordray
--yes.
mr.
richard
a.
cordray
that's
certainly
much
of
it.
i
think
also
there
is
the--
mr.
richard
a.
cordray
--well,
the
pr
itself
is
very
important.
i
mean,
it
certainly
helps
to
deter
criminal
conduct
for
people
around
the
country
to
know
that
the
officers
are
aggressively
pursuing
crime.
criminals
often
think
they're
not
going
to
be
caught.
if
they
know
that
the
officers
are
aggressively
pursuing
crime,
they
may
think
twice
before
they--
mr.
richard
a.
cordray
--no,
not
necessarily.
and
again,
that's...
that
has
to
do
with
the
nature
of
the
intrusion.
but
standing
alone--
mr.
richard
a.
cordray
--they
could
do
that,
and
certainly
they
could--
mr.
richard
a.
cordray
--perhaps,
but...
but
it's
not
a
silly...
it's
not
a
silly
point.
it
shouldn't
merely
evoke
laughter.
i
mean,
it's
not
as
though
police
know
ahead
of
time
that
they're
going
to
commit
an
abuse
or
they're
not
going
to
commit
an
abuse.
they...
they
deal
with
unforeseen
circumstances,
and
having
the
third
party
present
may
well
deter
abuse.
mr.
richard
a.
cordray
they
certainly
could
do
that.
in...
in
various
cases
perhaps
they
should
do
that.
whether
they
are
obliged
to
do
that
in
all
cases,
i
guess
is
part
of
the
calculus--
mr.
richard
a.
cordray
--in
fact,
that
was
true
in
the
hanlon
case
here.
mr.
richard
a.
cordray
there
are
police
photographers.
they
may
or
may
not
be
available.
it
might
be
within
the
discretion
of
the
officer
to
decide,
gee,
we
have
a
photographer
here.
gee,
this
means
that
might
be
the
best
way
to
execute
it
on
the
spot.
typically
those
decisions
have
been
left
to
the
discretion
of
officials
who
must
implement
these
policy--
mr.
richard
a.
cordray
--we
don't
know
that
one
way
or
another.
again,
as
a
matter
of
objective
reasonableness,
the
fact
that
their
photographs
or
videotape
could
be
used,
as
in
hanlon
they
were
used
to
resolve
the
consent
issue,
may
be
again
a
part
of
the
calculus.
mr.
richard
a.
cordray
yes,
your
honor,
i
think
there
is.
and
as
i
say,
this
court
has
never
addressed
this
whole
general
area
who
can
come
with
police,
and
so
some
guidance
will
be
useful
in
this
case.
but
to
draw
bright
lines
at
the
outset
in
a...
in
a
reasonableness
balancing
area
might
or
might
not
be
prudent.
here
i
think
there
are
certain
bright
lines
that
could
be
drawn.
anytime
an
arrest
warrant
is
being
executed,
i
think
in
general
it
will
be
objectively
reasonable
to
permit
media
to
accompany
and
observe.
if
a
search
warrant
is
being
executed
not
in
a
residence,
in
an
outer
area,
i
think
per
se
that
probably
will
be
acceptable
to
allow
accompaniment.
if
you
have
a
search
warrant
in
a
home
that's
going
to
involve
rummaging
through
private
papers
and
personal
effects,
perhaps
you
could...
you
could
determine
as
a
general
matter
that
might
well
be
unreasonable.
i
think
there
are
some
areas
where
clearly
it
would
be
unreasonable.
any
search
involving
physical
invasion
of
the
body,
body
cavity
search
or
the
like,
just
as
the
number
of
officers
present
in
such
a
search
is
always
minimized,
i
think
any
third
party
being
present
would
be
per
se
unreasonable.
mr.
richard
a.
cordray
correct.
there
was
an
audiotape
made
of
what
discussion
occurred
as
mr.
berger
and
the
officer
were
speaking
to
mrs.
berger.
that's
unproblematic
i
think--
mr.
richard
a.
cordray
--i
don't
think
so,
your
honor,
but
certainly
audiotapes
have
been
directly
addressed
by
this
court
in
terms
of
the
cases
of
people
wearing
a
wire,
white
v.
united
states,
lopez,
more
recently
caceres,
in
which
the
court
has
ultimately
found
there's
not
a
constitutional
problem
when
an
individual
is
speaking
to
a
government
agent,
even
if
they
don't
know
that
person
to
be
a
government
agent.
here
by
extension,
they
knew
full
well
they
were
speaking
to
federal
agents.
i
don't
think
there
could
be
a
reasonable
expectation
of
privacy
in
those
conversations.
as
to
whether
the--
mr.
richard
a.
cordray
--sure.
thank
you,
your
honor.
the
mitchell
v.
forsyth
case
on
qualified
immunity
is
on
all
fours
with
this
case.
there
there
was
an
allegation
that
the
fourth
amendment
was
violated.
it's
a
wiretapping
case.
at
the
time
of
the
actions,
there
were
only
two
federal
decisions,
both
unpublished,
which
had
upheld
the
legality
of
such
conduct.
it
was
a
fairly
common
practice,
had
been
occurring
episodically
for
25
years.
mr.
richard
a.
cordray
that's
right.
and
eventually
in
the
keith
case,
this
court
ultimately
resolved
that
such
conduct
was
unconstitutional,
but
the
decisions
that
held
that
postdated
the
events
in
question
in
the
mitchell
case.
all
of
that
is
on
all
fours
with
this
case
here.
the
only
decisions
at
the
time
here
had
indicated
that
such
conduct
was--
mr.
richard
a.
cordray
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
there
is...
there
is
legal
precedent
that
certainly
makes
that
a
harder
issue
in
this
case,
and
depending
on
how
the
court
rules,
it
may
become
clear
now
that...
that
this
practice
is
unacceptable.
mr.
richard
a.
cordray
yes,
although
we've...
we've
indicated
that
semayne's
case
is
quite
distinguishable
in
our
brief.
in
semayne's
case
it
was
service.
that's
the
british
case
involving
service
of
civil
process
in
a
home,
and
the
court
itself
distinguished
between
civil
process
and
criminal
process,
which
it
said
the
public
safety
supersedes
the
private.
blackstone
echoed
that
and
that's
generally
been
this
court's
approach,
for
example,
and
payton
recognized
that
an
arrest
warrant
permits
an
intrusion
into
the
home.
so,
again,
i
think
to
extrapolate
from
older,
especially
british
cases
and
early
cases
general
principles
to
say
that
officers
must
have
known
how
those
apply
in
these
specific
instances
would
be...
would
be
harsh,
particularly
given
that
the
courts
that
had
attempted
to
apply
such
principles
had
found
that
this
conduct
was...
was
constitutional.
and
the
only
decisions
that
have
ever
been
cited
to
the
contrary
postdated
these
events.
moreover,
if
this
were
an
unusual
practice,
if
it
had
not
been
engaged
in
except
very
occasionally
around
the
country,
that
might
explain
the
lack
of
this--
mr.
richard
a.
cordray
--not
only
that,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
a.
cordray
we
do,
but
the
fletcher
case--
mr.
richard
a.
cordray
--yes,
sir.
mr.
richard
a.
cordray
page
7
of
the
joint
appendix
in
the
wilson
case
contemplates
that
there
may
be
occasion.
it
says,
if
the
arrest
is
planned
to
take
place
inside
a
house
or
building,
agree
ahead
of
time
when
the
camera
can
enter
and
who
will
get
the
signal.
that
isn't
an
express
authorization
in
all
circumstances
to
take
media
into
a
home,
but
it
certainly
contemplates
that
a...
a
rule
that
would
say
you
can
never
allow
the
camera
and
the
media--
mr.
richard
a.
cordray
--that
was...
that
was
his
view
and
that
may
be
his
policy.
there
are
a
variety
of
policies
around
the
country.
i
think
it's
important--
mr.
richard
a.
cordray
--well,
i...
i
don't
think
so,
given
that...
given
that
the
case
law
at
the
time
did
not
clearly
establish
it,
and
judges
since
have...
have
disagreed,
you
know.
and
this
was
a
practice
that
was
common.
we
point
to
the
fletcher
case
from
the
florida
supreme
court
which
recognized
this
as
a
common
practice
at
the
common
law
as
of
1972,
and
the
prahl
case
on
remand
to
trial
court
in
wisconsin
found
this
to
be
a
common
practice.
mr.
richard
a.
cordray
i
think
certainly
the
court
would
be
concerned.
i
think
the
fact
that
it's
an
arrest
warrant
weighs
in
the
balance.
mr.
richard
a.
cordray
i
would
tend
to
suggest
a
more
fact-specific
approach
to
these
cases,
but
if
the
desire
is
to
draw
some
bright
lines,
that
may
be
one
that
could
be.
if
i
could--
mr.
richard
a.
cordray
--it
could
be.
if
i
could
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
richard
a.
cordray
first,
your
honors,
on
the
qualified
immunity
issue,
the
fact
that
there's
a
regular
practice
that's
occurred
frequently
around
the
country,
the
silence
of
the
books
there
has
to
weigh
in
favor
of
qualified
immunity.
this
practice
has
not
been
discredited,
but
it's
engaged
in
frequently.
how
could
it
possibly
be
that
officers
on
the
line
who
are
merely
obeying
instructions
to
allow
the
media
to
come
along
with
them...
they
don't
have
the
policies
in
mind,
justice
breyer,
nor
do
they
have
the
case
law
in
mind.
they
had
an
instruction.
it
came
down
from
headquarters.
those
people
knew
the
policy.
those
people
had
scrutinized
the
case
law.
mr.
richard
a.
cordray
we
speak
to
that.
it
was
taken
judicial
notice
upon
much...
many
submissions
and
much
study:
in
the
fletcher
case
where
the
florida
supreme
court
decided
in
1977
on
practices
engaged
in
in
1972;
the
prahl
case,
the
wisconsin
trial
court
found
again
that
this
was
common
custom
and
usage
around
the
country
for
media
to
accompany
police
inside
a
residence
when
there
was
an
issue
of
crime
or
other
matter
of
great
public
interest
that
had
occurred.
mr.
richard
a.
cordray
there
was.
there
were
voluminous
submissions
and
affidavits
of
this.
mr.
richard
a.
cordray
that's
true.
mr.
richard
a.
cordray
no,
but
when
the--
mr.
richard
a.
cordray
--when
the
practice
is
fairly
widely
engaged
in,
which
is
what
was
found
in
those
cases,
and
it
has
not
been
ruled
unconstitutional,
it's
very
difficult
to
say
officers
should
have
known.
and--
mr.
richard
a.
cordray
--the
moncrief
case
was
a
fourth
amendment
case
specifically.
mr.
richard
a.
cordray
as
demonstrated
by
the
marshals
service
and
justice
department
policies
in
place
at
the
time.
mr.
richard
a.
cordray
yes.
mr.
richard
a.
cordray
they
talk
generally
about
a
variety
of
circumstances
where
there
had
been
a
crime
committed.
i
mean,
here
there
certainly
was
a
crime
committed
by
dominic
wilson--
mr.
richard
a.
cordray
--they
don't...
they
don't
address
that
specific...
i
would
think
a
warrantless
situation
might
be
more
problematic.
here
at
least
you
have
the
comfort
that
a
court
has
looked
at
this
and
authorized
an
intrusion
by
the
police.
the
media
are
merely
an
additional
or
marginal
extra
intrusion
there.
mr.
richard
a.
cordray
it
would
be
factors
that
would
weigh
in
balancing
the
reasonableness
is
all,
your
honor.
on
the
3105
issue,
the
case
law
that's
cited,
the
schwimmer,
the
clouston,
those
are
all
expansive
cases,
who
can--
mr.
richard
a.
cordray
--all
expansive
cases,
who
can
be
brought
along
pursuant
to
3105.
none
of
them
are
limiting
cases.
none
of
them
disapproved
the
practice
of
people
being
along
to
observe,
whether
trainees,
whether
students,
or
the
like.
moreover,
the
fourth
amendment
does
not
only
preserve
privacy.
it
is
designed
to
prevent
abuses
of
government
power,
and
that
is
again
the
purpose
of
having
media
able
to
oversee
this
function
in
a
home
or
elsewhere.
