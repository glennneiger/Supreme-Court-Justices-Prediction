mr.
henry
h.
rossbacher
rossbacher,
your
honor.
mr.
henry
h.
rossbacher
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
searches
and
seizures
involved
in
the
berger
case
violate
the
core
values
and
the
core
holdings
of
this
court
in
relation
to
the
fourth
amendment
in
five
important
ways.
first,
the
warrant
was
used
as
a
general
warrant,
bringing
private
persons
onto
private
property
to
search
and
seize
for
their
private
purposes.
the
revolution
was
fought,
in
part,
to
prohibit
that.
second,
the
conduct
of
the
law
enforcement
officers
in
bringing
the
media,
the
private
persons,
on
was
not
authorized
by
the
warrant.
their
presence
was
not
authorized.
in
fact,
their
presence
which
had
been
guaranteed
by
an
assistant
u.s.
attorney
signing
a
contract
on
behalf
of
the
government
a
week
before
the
warrants
were
obtained
was
concealed
from
the
magistrate.
mr.
henry
h.
rossbacher
that
is
in
part
our
position,
your
honor.
mr.
henry
h.
rossbacher
we
are
not--
mr.
henry
h.
rossbacher
--no,
your
honor.
we
think
that
3105...
i
hadn't
finished
my
answer.
i
beg
my...
i
beg
your
pardon.
we
believe
3105...
as
sir
matthew
hale's
pleas
to
the
court
in
1600
said,
you
can
bring
a
private
person
along
as
long
as
he
is
under
the
authority
of
the
law
enforcement
officer
and
is
there
solely
to
execute
the
warrant
and
for
that
function.
here
it
is
undisputed
that
that
did
not
occur.
in
fact,
the
media--
mr.
henry
h.
rossbacher
--had
signed
a
contract--
mr.
henry
h.
rossbacher
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
henry
h.
rossbacher
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
henry
h.
rossbacher
the
warrant
authorizes,
as
we
understand
it
under
section
3105
and
the
fourth
amendment,
law
enforcement
to
bring
along
pursuant
to
that
explicit
authorization,
which
we
believe
is
a
constitutional
authorization,
people
who
are
necessary.
mr.
henry
h.
rossbacher
yes,
your
honor,
because
the
warrant
is
issued
in
the
context
of
section
3105
being--
mr.
henry
h.
rossbacher
--we
do
not
believe
the
attorney
was
authorized.
the
testimony
below
and
in
the
record
is
unequivocal
that
he
performed
no
role
in
the
search,
and
in
fact,
the
evidence
obtained
from
cnn--
mr.
henry
h.
rossbacher
--either.
both,
your
honor.
in
fact,
he
was
a
stranger
to
the
performance
of
the
warrant.
he
was
there
to
give
a
press
conference,
according
to
the
materials
we
obtained
from
cnn,
for
making
a
tv
show.
he
was
not
there
to
perform
any
law
enforcement
function
related
to
the
service
and
execution
of
the
warrant.
mr.
henry
h.
rossbacher
if
he
had
been
designated
as
necessary
by
the
executing
agent
under
3105--
mr.
henry
h.
rossbacher
--yes,
your
honor.
and
under
the
unanimous
cases
that
we've
cited
in
our
brief
construing
section
3105
from
the
circuits,
schwimmer,
clouston,
all
of
these,
the
3105
authorizes
the
executing
agent
to
bring
along
a
private
person
who
is
necessary,
provided
they
are
necessary
and
provided
their
activities
are
confined
to
execution
of
the
warrant.
mr.
henry
h.
rossbacher
i'm
not
aware,
your
honor,
that
they
do
go
in
with
police
wherever
they
go.
we
do
not
believe
that
people
who
are
there
just
to
observe
and
not
performing
an
essential
task--
mr.
henry
h.
rossbacher
--they
cannot
enter
pursuant
to
a
search
warrant
or
an
arrest
warrant
into
private
property
where
the
warrant
is
necessary.
the
authority
of
the
warrant...
or
the
specific
police
power
of
the
law
enforcement
officer
is
necessary
to
enter
the
property.
mr.
henry
h.
rossbacher
we
believe
that's--
mr.
henry
h.
rossbacher
--presumably
he
can
leave
the
car.
he
cannot
enter
private
property
pursuant
to
the
authority
given
to
the
police
by
the
warrant.
mr.
henry
h.
rossbacher
not
if
they're
just
watching,
your
honor.
if
they
are
there
to
execute
the
warrant
and
it--
mr.
henry
h.
rossbacher
--then
it
is
our
view--
mr.
henry
h.
rossbacher
--not
on
private
property,
your
honor,
not
in
violation
of
the
privacy
rights
and
the
core
values
protected
by
the
fourth
amendment.
mr.
henry
h.
rossbacher
your
honor,
there
was
no--
mr.
henry
h.
rossbacher
--we
believe
so,
your
honor.
mr.
henry
h.
rossbacher
i
know
you
do,
your
honor.
i
don't
think
that
that...
when
you're
in
the
open
fields
it
is...
it
is
clearly
established
as
to
what
can
be
done
there.
but
what
is
clearly
established
is
that
no
authority
of
the
warrant
can
be
used
to
justify
private
parties.
what's
happening
here...
and
i
would
like
to
correct
a
misstatement
that
i'll
get
to
as
to
what
was
done
with
this
warrant.
the
warrant
was
represented
to
cover
everything,
including
the
house.
the
press
was
brought
along
solely...
and
they
have
said
this...
solely
on
the
authority
of
law
enforcement
officers
to
enter
and,
in
essence,
be
immune
from
their...
the
consequences
of
their
conduct
under
the
open
fields
doctrine.
as
a
result,
we
believe
that
that's
improper,
and
that
does
violate
the
fourth
amendment.
mr.
henry
h.
rossbacher
your
honor,
there
is
a
problem
with
that
and
that
is
that
in
this
case,
cnn
asserts
that
it
has
an
absolute
defense
to
charges
against
trespass,
charges
against
any
kind
of
tortious
conduct
because
of
the
permission
given
by
law
enforcement
to
enter.
their...
their
position
is
not
that
the
first
amendment
allowed
them
to
do
this.
mr.
henry
h.
rossbacher
no,
but
it...
it
is
problematical
in
that
what
law
enforcement
is
doing
here
is,
in
fact,
facilitating
a
tort
explicitly.
they're
attempting
to
immunize
a
tort.
and
we
think
that
that's
inappropriate
and
improper
and
violates
the
fourth
amendment.
in
addition,
it's
not
possible
to
argue
that
this
was
not
clearly
established.
section
3105
and
the
cases
that
interpret
it
have
said
clearly
for
years
that
in
fact
law
enforcement
officers
are
not
free
to
bring
strangers
to
the
warrant
on
private
property
except
for
the
purposes
of
3105.
mr.
henry
h.
rossbacher
your
honor,
let
us
look--
mr.
henry
h.
rossbacher
--but
let
us
look
at
what
happened
here.
first,
they
entered
the
house
pursuant
to
the
claim
that
the
warrant
covered
the
house.
that
was
what
triggered
the
entry.
there
was
no
consent.
the
officers
have
testified
there
was
no
consent.
mr.
henry
h.
rossbacher
there
was
no
factual
finding
of
consent.
it
was
not
litigated
below
in
the
district--
mr.
henry
h.
rossbacher
--i
understand.
mr.
henry
h.
rossbacher
even
if
there
was
consent,
the
position
is
that
they
could
not
bring
in
the
press
with
a
microphone
to
seize
conversations
protected
by
silverman
and
these
cases
and
katz
in
the
house,
which
is
what
was
done.
it
was
done
on
9
or
10
separate
occasions.
they
taped
solely...
law
enforcement
did
not
tape.
the
tapes
were
not
made
available
to
law
enforcement.
they
were
not
in
their
possession,
either
video
or
oral
tapes.
they
were,
in
fact,
refused
to
be
produced
in
the
criminal
trial,
and
the
government
in
fact
even
refused
to
admit
there
was
a
contract
here.
mr.
henry
h.
rossbacher
no.
they...
they
entered
the
house
under
a
claim
that
they
had
a
right
to
search
the
house,
and
they
in
fact
went
through
the
house,
and
they
recorded
in
the
house.
and
we
believe
that
is
a
search
and
a
seizure.
mr.
henry
h.
rossbacher
we
believe
that
there--
mr.
henry
h.
rossbacher
--your
honor,
they
entered
the
house
and
observed
what
was
there.
mr.
henry
h.
rossbacher
your
honor,
when
they
say
that
they're
entering
pursuant
to
a
search
warrant
and
they
assert
their
absolute
right
to
do
that,
when
they
enter--
mr.
henry
h.
rossbacher
--i
understand.
mr.
henry
h.
rossbacher
we
believe
so,
your
honor,
yes.
mr.
henry
h.
rossbacher
they
went
through
the
rooms,
yes.
mr.
henry
h.
rossbacher
they
did
not
tear
the
place
apart,
your
honor.
they
went
through
the
rooms--
mr.
henry
h.
rossbacher
--i
don't
believe,
your
honor,
it's
fair
to
say
that
when
a
law
enforcement
officer
enters
your
house
pursuant
to
a
search
warrant
and
a
claim
of
right,
that
in
fact
he's
not
searching
when
he
observes
what
he
observes
there
and
was
free
to
testify
about
it.
mr.
henry
h.
rossbacher
absolutely,
your
honor,
that
in
fact,
under
bumpers
and
under
schneckloth,
in
fact,
having
asserted
on
the--
mr.
henry
h.
rossbacher
--the
warrant
excluded--
mr.
henry
h.
rossbacher
--if
the
media
seized
it,
as
they
did
with
the
recordings,
we
believe
it
is
like
the
extra
mikes
installed
in
the
house.
mr.
henry
h.
rossbacher
the
police
seized--
mr.
henry
h.
rossbacher
--we
think
it
makes
the
search
unreasonable,
but
we're
not
sure
that
it
triggers
the
exclusionary
rule
because
in
fact
what
would
be
found
would
be
found
properly
by
the
officers.
you're
really
talking
more
i
believe
with
respect
about
the
operation
of
the
exclusionary
rule.
mr.
henry
h.
rossbacher
i
hope
not,
your
honor.
mr.
henry
h.
rossbacher
captured
on
the
press
camera,
the
press
tape
we
believe
would
be...
would
be
suppressed.
and
officer's
testimony
as
to
him
finding
the
evidence
or
the
evidence
itself
would
not
be
because
that
would
not
be
in
excess
of
the
warrant,
as
you
phrased
your
question
to
me,
as
i
understand
it.
but
the
seizure
by
the
press,
just
as
if
the
press
wandered
off
by
themselves
into
a
shed
and
found
evidence
and
seized
it,
would
clearly
be--
mr.
henry
h.
rossbacher
--it
might
well,
your
honor.
it
might
be
a
hard
argument
to
make
if
in
fact
the
press
goes
off
and...
and
films
things
and
the
police
doesn't
bother
to
look
there
and
then
later
the
tape
shows
it.
i
mean,
that
would
be
a
situation--
mr.
henry
h.
rossbacher
--we
don't
think
that
that
per
se
triggers
the
exclusionary
rule,
but
we
think
that
it
is
a
general
warrant.
we
think
it
violates
the
fourth
amendment,
and
we
think
that
the
private
electronic...
private
electronic
surveillance
that
took
place
here
by
the
cnn
is
a
separate
search
by
a
private
party
for
their
private
purposes,
the
proceeds
of
which
is
not
properly
seized
by
the
government.
the
cases
of
this
court
involving
the
extent
of
a
search,
for
example,
arizona
v.
hicks
and
andresen,
we
believe
should
inform
the
court's
consideration
of
what
happened
here.
the
court
has
been
eternally
vigilant
and
jealous
of
confining
law
enforcement
officers
to
what
is
explicitly
authorized.
for
example,
you
can't
turn
over
a
bang
and
olafson
box.
in
andresen,
very
clear
in
note
11
that
the
officers
are
required
to
minimize
their
conduct
and
minimize
their
intrusion.
here,
bringing
the
press,
is
absolutely
designed
to
maximize
the
intrusion.
it
is
contemplated
and
was
contemplated
here
that
the
intrusion
into
privacy
would
be
broadcast
nationally
and
internationally.
there
could
be
no
greater
affront
toward
the
right
to
privacy
found
by
winston
and
soldal
by
this
court
under
the
fourth
amendment
than
to
authorize
worldwide
broadcasts.
i
would
like
to
get
to
the
argument
of
our
opponents
that
in
fact
there
were
cases
authorizing
this
and
this
was
somehow
widespread.
i
would...
i
would
submit
to
you
there
is
no
record.
the
practice
of
bringing
press
people,
or
private
persons
for
that
matter,
for
private
purposes
into
private
homes
was
widespread.
mr.
henry
h.
rossbacher
i
know
of
none,
your
honor.
mr.
henry
h.
rossbacher
and
i
think
that...
that
to
bring
in...
to
expressly
authorize
private
persons
for
their...
for
their
private
purposes,
even
as
has
been
held
by
the
bills
i
court
in
the
circuit
to
be
inappropriate
and
constitutionally
questionable;
in
addition,
in
the
sanusi
case,
by
judge
weinstein.
but
there
is
a
whole
line
of
cases,
clouston
and
schwimmer
under
3105,
and
another
line
of
cases
which
says
that
merely
because
law
enforcement
can
enter
for
an
appropriate
purpose,
for
example,
the
warren
case,
coast
guard
can
enter
to
inspect
your
ship,
but
they
can't
bring
a
drug
agent
to
search
for
drugs.
that's
what
happened
here.
law
enforcement
entered
to
search
for
poisons.
they
brought
along
the
press
to
search
for...
for
tv
footage
or
film
whatever
they
wanted.
there's
no...
there's
no
limitation
of
the
press
coverage
here
to
what
the
officers
were
doing.
it's...
it's
a
ex
post
facto
rationale.
mr.
henry
h.
rossbacher
that
is
one
of
our
complaints.
and
they
were
free
to
do
so.
in
fact,
some
of
the
tapes
show
that
they're
out
filming
something
and
mr.
berger
says,
what
are
you
doing?
this
is
when
mr.
berger
gets
threatened
with
going
to
jail.
and
mr.
berger
is
directed
away,
is
threatened
with
going
to
jail,
and
the
press
is
out
filming
what
they
want
within
mr.
berger's
buildings.
so,
there
was
no
confining
of
the
press
to
some
limited
role
of
even
covering
law
enforcement.
this--
mr.
henry
h.
rossbacher
--no,
i
would
not.
but
i
don't
want
the
impression
to
be
given
that
this
is
somehow
some
kind
of
very
controlled,
restricted,
disciplined
operation
going
on.
mr.
henry
h.
rossbacher
that's
correct.
and
our
argument
is
the
circuit
court
opinions
which
look
at
minimization,
all
of
this
court's
cases
that
look
with...
at
minimization
of
the
intrusion
and
confining
to
the
purpose
of
the
warrant
itself,
not
general
law
enforcement
purposes,
mandate
and
were
clearly
established
at
the
time
all
of
this
took
place.
the
second
circuit,
the
fourth
circuit
in
buonocore,
and
the
ninth
circuit
all
found
that
this
was
clearly
established,
and
they
also
found
that
3105
prohibited
this
conduct.
3105
has
been
on
the
books
a
long
time.
mr.
henry
h.
rossbacher
but
the
cases
in
schwimmer
the...
the
circuit
court
decisions
in
schwimmer
and
clouston
and
the
other
cases
that
interpret
it
that
are
present
in
our
brief
do
talk
about
the
fact
that
the
only
justification
for
being
along
is
because
you're
complying
with
3105.
mr.
henry
h.
rossbacher
no,
your
honor,
but
they--
mr.
henry
h.
rossbacher
--well,
that's
what
i
am
arguing
and
i
also
think
the
statute
clearly
established
it
itself.
under
harlow
you
say
that,
in
fact,
it's
not
just
constitutional
rights
but
statutory
rights.
3105
we
believe
is
the
constitutional
rule,
but
it
also
created
a
clear
rule
not
to
be
searched
by
strangers
to
the
warrant.
and
so--
mr.
henry
h.
rossbacher
--your
honor,
if
you
look
at
the
wilson
v.
layne
facts,
where
the
media
takes
photographs
of
these
people,
which
it
was
free
to
publish,
isn't
that
a
search?
isn't
that
a
seizure
both
of
the
images
and
a
search?
because
the
only
way--
mr.
henry
h.
rossbacher
--thank
you,
your
honor.
