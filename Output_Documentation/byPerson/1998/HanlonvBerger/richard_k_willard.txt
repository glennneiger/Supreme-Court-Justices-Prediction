mr.
richard
k.
willard
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
constitutional
issue
in
this
case
does
not
involve
a
balancing
test.
it
involves
a
bright
line
rule
drawn
at
the
front
door
of
the
home.
our
position
is
that
any
trespass
into
the
home
by
the
government
is
per
se
a
violation
of
the
fourth
amendment.
this
authority,
going
back
to
the
common
law
as
old
as
semayne's
case,
makes
it
clear
that
when
the
police
enter
a
home,
they
have
the
authority
only
to
execute
criminal
process.
they
cannot
enter
the
home
in
order
to
execute
civil
process,
even
though
civil
process
may
serve
many
important
public
purposes.
it
may
be
useful
to
have
civil
cases
resolved
and
to
have
evidence,
and
yet,
since
semayne's
case,
it
has
been
clear
that
the
only
authority
the
police
have
to
enter
the
home
is
the
authority
to
enter
to
execute
criminal
process.
mr.
richard
k.
willard
that's
correct.
mr.
richard
k.
willard
that's
correct,
your
honor.
they
had
an
arrest
warrant.
that
arrest
warrant
gave
them
the
implicit
authority--
mr.
richard
k.
willard
--yes,
your
honor.
i
represent
the
plaintiffs
in
the
wilson
case.
they
had
an
arrest
warrant
which
gave
them
the
implicit
authority
to
enter
the
home
where
they
believed
that
dominic
wilson
lived,
for
one
purpose,
and
that
was
to
effectuate
his
arrest.
entry
of
the
media
was
entirely
ultra
vires
of
the
warrant.
the
warrant
did
not
implicitly...
it
certainly
didn't
explicitly...
didn't
even
implicitly
authorize
bringing
along
the
media
on
a
news
gathering
expedition.
in
this
case,
it's
very
clear
because
the
defendants
have
conceded
that
news
media
were
not
there
in
order
to
assist
in
execution
of
the
warrant.
there
may
be
some
difficult,
gray-area
cases
involving,
say,
trainees
or
prosecutors
where
there's
some
argument
that
they're
there
to
assist
in
execution
of
the
warrant.
i
think--
mr.
richard
k.
willard
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
the
media,
as
far
as
we're
concerned,
is
like
the
sister-in-law.
they're
not
there
under
any
colorable
reason
to
assist
in
execution
of
the
warrant.
they're
there
for
a
different
purpose.
mr.
richard
k.
willard
i...
i
understand,
your
honor.
and
i
think
there
may
be
situations
where
trainees
would
be
authorized
to
assist
in
the
event
that
they
were
needed
in
execution
of
a
warrant.
if
the
violence
erupted,
they
might
be
there
in
order
to
help
out.
similarly,
prosecutors
might
be
able
to
provide
legal
advice.
mr.
richard
k.
willard
i
think
they
can,
your
honor,
but
the
fact
that
someone
may
be
designated
a
trainee,
if
they're
authorized
to
assist
in
execution
of
the
warrant,
even
though
they
may
be
there
primarily
to
observe,
we
don't
think
that
would
trigger
this...
this
bright
line
rule.
mr.
richard
k.
willard
i
understand,
your
honor.
if...
if
the
factual
circumstances
showed
that
he
legitimately
believed
the
people
being
brought
in
were
there
in
aid
of
execution
of
the
warrant--
mr.
richard
k.
willard
--well--
mr.
richard
k.
willard
--your
honor,
well,
in
the
first
place,
factually
here
the
officers
testified
that's
not
why
they
brought
the
police
along.
they
testified
they
were
not
there
to
aid
in
any
particular
law
enforcement
mission.
all
of
this
is
a
post
hoc
rationalization
of
counsel,
and
so
as
a
factual
matter,
the
predicate
is
not
supported
in
the
record
here.
even
if
it
were,
we
would
not
concede
that
that
would
be
a...
a
reasonable
interpretation
of
the
law.
there
is
no
court
that
had
held
explicitly
that
it
was
okay
to
bring
in
the
media
and
that
this
was...
satisfied
the
fourth
amendment's
requirements.
the
only
cases
that
have
been
cited
here...
there
were
only
three
cited.
two
of
them,
unpublished
district
court
cases,
were
decided
on
the
basis
to
the
right
to
privacy.
they
cited
cases
like
abortion
in...
in
terms
of
whether
there
was
an
invasion
of
privacy.
they
didn't
analyze
the
fourth
amendment.
mr.
richard
k.
willard
yes,
your
honor.
that
was
the
moncrief
and
higbee--
mr.
richard
k.
willard
--well,
it
may
be
a...
it
may
be
a
criticism
of
the
lawyers
in
those
cases
for
not
raising
it,
but
it
doesn't
show
that
the
court
squarely
considered
and
decided
the
issue
against
us.
mr.
richard
k.
willard
well,
your
honor,
i
guess
we
don't
agree
the
u.s.
marshals
service
policy
says
it's
okay.
our
position
is...
the
court
can
read
the
policy.
it's
in
the
joint
appendix...
is
that
it's
agnostic
on
that
question,
whereas
the
montgomery
county
sheriff's
policy
was
quite
clear
that
it
wasn't
allowed.
so,
the
policies
here:
one
was
agnostic;
the
other
one
said
don't
do
it.
so,
in
this
case
the
officers
had
policies
that
tilted
against
doing
it,
not
in
favor
of
it.
even
if
they
did,
though,
our
position
is
this
nebulous
assistance
to
the
law
enforcement
mission
of
deterring
crime
is
not
the
kind
of
assistance
that
the
constitution
permits
implicit
to
a
warrant.
mr.
richard
k.
willard
i
understand,
your
honor.
i
was
hoping
to
get
a
chance
to
answer
that.
i
think
if
the
law
students
have
been
authorized
to
provide
legal
advice
to
the
police
or
to
assist
in
prosecuting--
mr.
richard
k.
willard
--if
that's
all,
then
they
wouldn't
be
allowed
to
do
it.
but
i
know
there
are
many
programs
where
law
students
serve
as
prosecutors
under
special
provisions
or
as...
or
might
be
able
to
provide
legal
advice
on
constitutional
law
to
the
police.
in
that
case
it
would
be
like
a
regular
prosecutor
who
in
our
view
normally
would
be
allowed
to
go
in,
the
theory
that
they
could
advise
the
police
on
legal
issues
that
would
come
up,
and
that
would
relate
to
the
purpose
of
actually
executing
the
warrant.
but
our
position
is
if
it's
this
broad,
nebulous
purpose
of
educating
the
public,
that
that
is
not
permitted.
and
that
pretty
clearly
would
not
have
been
permitted
in
1603.
in
other
words,
this
is
not
a
new
doctrine
we're
advocating.
it
would
have
been
clear--
mr.
richard
k.
willard
--i
understand,
your
honor,
but
it
would
have
been...
it
would
have
been
repugnant
to
the
common
law
in
1603
and
to
the
framers
at
the
time
the
fourth
amendment
was
adopted.
mr.
richard
k.
willard
that's
correct,
your
honor,
and
our
position
would
be
unless
they're...
they're
authorized,
as
they
might
be,
to
provide
legal
advice
and
assistance
to
the
police
officers,
they
wouldn't
be
allowed
to
go
into
private
homes
without
the
consent
of
the
residents.
mr.
richard
k.
willard
your
honor,
the
record...
the
record
in
this
case
does
not
establish
that
it
was
clearly
understood
in
the
law
enforcement
community
it
was
okay.
we
cited
some
model
guidelines
of
law
enforcement
adopted
in
1974
in
our
brief
which
said
that
the
media
should
not
be
permitted
to
go
into
private
homes.
mr.
richard
k.
willard
your
honor,
i
don't
agree.
in
this
case
where
there
is
an
entry
into
the
home
without
legal
authority,
the
burden
is
on
the
government
to
show
the
authority
to
enter
the
home,
and
that
was
a
clearly
established
principle.
and,
therefore,
if
the
police
officers
didn't
know
whether
it
was
okay
or
not
to
bring
the
media
into
a
private
home,
they
violated
clearly
established
law
in
doing
so.
this
is
not
an
area
that
reasonable
lawyers
or
judges
could
disagree
about.
this
is
an
area
where
any
reasonable
judge,
any
reasonable
lawyer
would
conclude
that
when
there
is
no
legal
authority,
entry
into
the
home
is
one
of
the
clearest
violations
of
the
fourth
amendment
that
can
possibly
be
imagined.
mr.
richard
k.
willard
yes,
your
honor,
and
there
were
cases
establishing
that
that
was
appropriate.
mr.
richard
k.
willard
well,
your
honor,
i
guess
i
don't
agree
that
it's
a
murky
line.
the
line
is
spelled
out
clearly
in
section
3105
with
regard
to
search
warrants,
and
it
says
officers
or
those
in
aid
of
the
officers.
in
our
view
that's
the
clear
line.
officers
or
those
who
are
aiding
the
law...
the
officers
in
executing
the
warrant.
and
here
the...
the
defendants
have
conceded
quite
clearly
and
repeatedly
that
the
media
were
not
there
to
assist
in
any
way
in
execution
of
the
warrant.
mr.
richard
k.
willard
they're
not
like
the
translator.
they're
not
like
the
locksmith.
mr.
richard
k.
willard
well,
your
honor,
but
that's
not
all
we
rely
upon.
we
also
rely
upon
the
common
law
which
establishes
quite
clearly
that
when
the
media
went
into
the
wilson's
home,
they
were
committing
a
trespass.
mr.
richard
k.
willard
yes,
your
honor,
that
is
the
nub
of
the
problem.
we
contend
that
it's
a
fairly
bright
line,
that
is,
in
aid
of
execution
of
the
warrant
or
not
in
aid
of
execution
of
the
warrant.
and
if
it's
in
aid
of
something
other
than
executing
a
warrant,
in
aid
of
educating
the
public,
in
aid
of
promoting
confidence
in
law
enforcement
or
whatever,
that
that
is
not
authorized.
and
i
think
the
framers
of
the
fourth
amendment
would
roll
over
in
their
graves
if
they
thought
that
the
media
could
be
brought
into
private
homes
by
the
police,
not
to
assist
the
police
in
executing
a
warrant,
but
to
help
broadcast
to
the
public
at
large
what
they
saw
inside
a
private
home.
mr.
richard
k.
willard
well,
your
honor,
going
all
the
way
back
to
the
entick
case,
which
we
cite
in
our
brief,
where
lord
camden
explained
that
when
you're
entering
into
the
home
because
of
the
high
degree
of
protection
even
at
the
common
law
the
home
had,
that
it's
not
enough
to
have
the
silence
of
the
books.
his
position
there
is
the
silence
of
the
books
speaks
against
the
authority
of
the
intrusion;
that
is,
that
those
who
would
intrude
into
the
home
at
the
common
law,
as
well
as
today,
have
to
show
legal
authority
to
go
in,
not
the
burden
on
the
homeowner
to
show
legal
authority
to
keep
them
out.
mr.
richard
k.
willard
as
a
matter
of
fact
we
could.
we
found
a
number
of
cases,
which
we
cited
in
our
brief,
including
one
of
them
that
held
there
wasn't
an
invasion
of
privacy
in
a
constitutional
sense,
but
all
of
which
held
that
it
was
a
trespass.
mr.
richard
k.
willard
no,
your
honor,
we
don't.
but
we
contend
that
it
was
clearly
established
and
has
been
clearly
established
that
for
the
government
to
sponsor
a
trespass
into
the
home
is
itself
a
violation
of
the
fourth
amendment,
and
a
reasonable
officer
would
not
think
otherwise.
if
we're
thinking
in
terms
now
of
the...
the
officer
trying
to
decide
what's
right
and
what's
wrong,
if
he's
read
cases
that
say
it's
a
trespass,
it's
unlawful
for
the
media
to
come
into
a
home,
we
would
say
it's
not
reasonable
for
him
then
to
bring
them
in
even
though
the
cases
only
held
it
was
unlawful
and
not
a
violation
of
the
fourth
amendment.
mr.
richard
k.
willard
that's
correct,
your
honor,
because
the
fourth
amendment
has
been
held
by
this
court
to
protect
houses
and
not
open
fields.
and
in
this
case
it's
fairly
clear
the
plain
language
of
the
fourth
amendment
speaks
of
houses,
and
that's
what
we're
talking
about,
an
intrusion
into
a
house.
mr.
richard
k.
willard
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
k.
willard
yes,
your
honor.
it's
our
position
that
this
statute
codifies
the
common
law
understanding
that
the
execution
of
a
warrant
should
be
accomplished
by
law
enforcement
officers
or
those...
those
assisting,
and
that
the...
and
that
that's
all
that
the
warrant
conveys
authority
to
do.
mr.
richard
k.
willard
that...
that...
that's
correct,
your
honor.
and
there
is
similar
language
in
rule
4
of
the
federal
rules
of
criminal
procedure,
which
we
also
cite
in
our
brief
at
page
39.
mr.
richard
k.
willard
i
think
the
law
has
established
that
would
be
implicitly
authorized
by
the
warrant
even
though
he's
not
named
by
name
if
he's
there
to
assist
them
to
deal
with
possible
violence
or
something
like
that.
now,
if
a
law
enforcement
officer
who
is
visiting...
you
know,
the
sister-in-law
is
visiting
and
is
there
just
for
fun
and
not
to
provide
any
assistance,
then
that
might
create
a
different
issue.
but
here
again,
we're
not
talking...
i
mean,
we've
had
some
very
interesting
and
difficult
hypothetical
questions
about
exactly
where
the
line
is
drawn
among
prosecutors
or
trainees
or
people
like
that.
that's
not
this
case.
this
case
involves
bringing
in
people
who
could
not
possibly
have
been
thought
to
be
there
in
order
to
assist
in
execution
of
the
warrant.
they
were
there
for
a
totally
different,
a
private
purpose
which,
going
all
the
way
back
to
semayne's
case,
has
been
prohibited
in
terms
of
an
entry
into
the
home.
mr.
richard
k.
willard
well,
but
only
in
this
most
nebulous
sense.
i
mean,
this
argument,
if
we
credit
it,
would
open
the
doors
to
anything.
it
would
open
the
doors
to
the
high
school
civics
class
going
in,
the
sister-in-law,
or
whatever.
mr.
richard
k.
willard
no,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
k.
willard
no,
your
honor,
because
what
we're
talking
about
here
is
media
access
at
the
sufferance
of
the
police.
the
police
claim
here
a
discretionary
right
to
bring
in
media
at
their
choosing
to
witness.
this
is
not
much
of
a
safeguard
to
the
public.
mr.
richard
k.
willard
thank
you,
your
honor.
