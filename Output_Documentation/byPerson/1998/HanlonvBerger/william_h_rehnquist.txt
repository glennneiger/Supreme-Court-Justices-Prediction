we'll
hear
argument
now
in
two
cases
that
have
been
consolidated
for
argument:
no.
97-1927,
rodney
c.
hanlon,
et
al.
v.
paul
w.
berger;
and
98-83,
charles

v.
harry

chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
cordray.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief

the
second
case
i
have
to
announce
is
no.
97-1927,
hanlon
against
berger
which
is
the
companion
case
to
wilson
against
layne.
in
this
case
agents
of
the
united
states
fish
and
wildlife
service
search
the
ranch
and
its
outbuildings.
while
accompanied
by
a
cnn
camera
crew.
this
case,
it
raises
the
same
issues
as
wilson
against
layne
does.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
held
that
the
agents
violated
the
clearly
established
fourth
amendment
rights
of
the
homeowners.
under
our
holding
today
in
wilson
that
right
was
not
clearly
established
at
the
time
of
this
search
which
was
also
in
the
early
part
of
the
90s.
the
agents
are
therefore
entitled
to
qualify
the
immunity
and
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
reversed.
justice
stevens
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
part
and
dissenting
in
part.
