unknown
speaker
well,
let's...
let's
get
to
the
help
that
you
claim
was
provided
here.
what's
your
argument
here?
unknown
speaker
it
has
since
been...
that
section
has
since
been
repealed.
is
that
correct?
unknown
speaker
amended
out
of
existence
as
i
recall.
unknown
speaker
how
does
it
read
now?
unknown
speaker
does
it
say
that
they
may
take
members
of
the
media
into
people's
houses,
into
private
places--
unknown
speaker
--well,
why
do
you
have
to
take
photographers
into
someone's
house
to
aid
law
enforcement
in
that
respect?
i
mean,
you
can
have
a
news
conference
when
it's
over
if
you
want
to.
i
don't
see
why
you...
you
have
to
take
people
into
private
places.
unknown
speaker
no.
i
just
want
to
know
whether
there's
anything
substantial
to
this
or
whether
it's...
whether
it's
fluff.
it
sounds
like
fluff.
unknown
speaker
but
why
just
the
media,
mr.
cordray?
do...
do
you
know
of
any
other
area
of
law
in
which
the...
the
media,
quotes,
have
been
given
special
constitutional
privileges
that...
that
john
q.
public
wouldn't
have?
unknown
speaker
so,
they
could
have
brought
in
maybe
their
sister-in-law
to...
to
watch
the
thing
too
as
well.
is
that...
is
that
it?
unknown
speaker
do
they
drive
right
into
the
house?
yes,
right
into
the
house
or...
or
inside
premises
on
a
search
warrant
or...
or
is
the
program
more
one
of
letting
them
ride
in
squad
cars
and
see
whatever
occurs
on
the
street?
unknown
speaker
do
you
know
of
any
that
allow
private
citizens
to
accompany
officers
inside
dwellings
to
execute
a
search
warrant?
unknown
speaker
no,
but
your
argument
was
that
there
were...
there
were...
throughout
the
country,
there
was
a
practice
of
ride-along,
and
our
question
is
do
they
ride
right
into
the
house.
unknown
speaker
do
you
have
specific
instances
in
which
this
is
going
on?
unknown
speaker
no.
unknown
speaker
i
think
the
question...
excuse
me.
i
think
the
question
that
we're...
we're
pursuing
is,
are
individuals
other
than
those
in
the
media
going
into
people's
houses
for
the
execution
of
warrants
in
a
capacity
simply
as
observers,
not
performing
any
law
enforcement
function?
and
i...
i
think
we
got...
several
of
us
i
guess
got
the
suggestion
from
you
that
the
answer
to
that
was
yes,
and
we
want
to
know
whether
that
is
specifically
correct.
is
there
a
practice
out
there
in
the
country,
apart
from
the
marshals
service,
of
taking
members
of
the
public,
performing
no
law
enforcement
function,
into
private
places
during
the
execution
of
a
warrant?
unknown
speaker
all
right.
we'll...
we'll
accept
that
qualification.
are
members
of
the
general
public
going
into
people's
houses
during
the
execution
of
the
warrants?
is
this
a
common
practice?
we'd
just
like
to
know
that.
unknown
speaker
do
you
have
any
instances?
unknown
speaker
mr.
cordray--
--for
media
to
accompany,
but
not
for
private
individuals.
as
far
as
you
know,
it
is
not
and
has
never
been
common
practice
for
police
officers
to
bring
in
non-media
people
to
show
that...
that
everything
is
open
and
above
board.
unknown
speaker
can
you
answer
my
question?
as
far
as
you
know,
there
was
no
such
practice.
unknown
speaker
do
you
know...
do
you
know
of
any...
do
you
know
of
any
such
practice?
unknown
speaker
may
i...
may
i
ask
you
specifically
about
the
law
school
program?
there
are
law
schools
that
do
have
their
students
ride
along.
indeed,
some
of
them
have
had
professors
who
have
written
books
about
their
ride-along
experiences.
are
there
controls
on
that
kind
of
ride-along
to
avoid
the
unnecessary
intrusion
on
people's
privacy?
unknown
speaker
in
the...
in
the
montana
case,
there
was
no
entry
into
the
house
by
virtue
of
the
warrant.
isn't
that
true?
unknown
speaker
by
consent?
unknown
speaker
but
there
was
an
entry
into
sheds
and
outbuildings,
as
i
understand
it.
unknown
speaker
with
regard
to
those,
does
the
evidence
disclose
whether
those
buildings
had
open
doors
or
anything
like
that
or...
or
what
do
we
know
about
those
sheds
and
outbuildings?
unknown
speaker
and
that
issue
wasn't
resolved
below
because
it
was
a...
pretty
much
a
per
se
rule
applied,
i
take
it.
unknown
speaker
well,
do
you
understand
the
open--
--you
don't
really
know
whether
open...
whether
sheds,
closed
sheds
at
least,
that
are
outside
the
curtilage
come
within
the
open
fields
doctrine.
we
haven't...
we
haven't
held
one
way
or
another
on
that
point,
have
we?
unknown
speaker
but
you
don't
understand
the...
or
maybe
you
do...
the
open
fields
doctrine
to
permit
a
police
officer
to
stay
on
an
open
field
if
the
owner
tells
him
to
leave,
do
you?
unknown
speaker
but
in
the...
in
the
oliver
case,
the
court
was
referring
to
the
fact
that
officers
happened
to
be
in
an
open
area
and
they
were
concerned
with
viewing
something
in
an
open
field
from
a
highway.
but
in...
in...
in
this
case,
the
police
and
the
accompanying
news
people
demanded,
in
effect,
entrance
and
had
the
right
to
enter
under
a
warrant--
unknown
speaker
--and...
and
threatened
the
owner
with...
with
imprisonment
if...
if
he
obstructed
their
search.
so,
it
seems
to
me
that's
quite
different.
i...
i'm
not
sure
the
open
fields
doctrine
would
apply
if
you
told
the
police
officer
to
leave.
unknown
speaker
well,
supposing
there's
a
policeman
that's
standing
out
on
your
front
lawn,
and
you
tell
him,
get
off,
and
he
says,
no,
i
want
to
look
in
your
window.
[laughter]
i
mean,
is
that
a
trespass
violation
or
a
fourth
amendment
violation
or
what?
unknown
speaker
i
think
that
bears
on
the
open...
open
fields
question.
unknown
speaker
why
do
you
need
a
warrant
under
the
open
fields
doctrine?
unknown
speaker
of
course,
just
because
the
police
can...
can
play
around
in
open
fields,
it
doesn't
mean
that
they
can
bring
along
anybody
else
they
want
to
play
in
the
open
fields.
unknown
speaker
so,
i
mean,
even
if
you
resolve
the
open
field
question,
there's
still
the
further
question
of
whether
whatever
open
fields
immunity
from
the
fourth
amendment
the
officers
have
extends
to
the...
the
officers
bringing
along
somebody
else
as
well
i
assume.
unknown
speaker
but
as
you
put
it,
we
shouldn't
adopt
a
rule
regarding
media
accompaniment.
unknown
speaker
so,
it
is...
it
is
part
of
your
case
that...
that...
that
there's
a...
a
different
rule
for
media,
and
that...
and
that
it's...
it's
better
to
bring
media
along
than
to
bring
your
sister-in-law.
unknown
speaker
personally
i'd
rather
have
your
sister-in-law
along
than--
unknown
speaker
--it's
fairly
common,
isn't
it,
mr.
cordray,
to
bring
along
the
claimant
to
stolen
property
with
the
search
so
that
he...
it's
his
property
presumably
if
they're
successful,
and
he
should
identify
it?
unknown
speaker
but
those
are
to
aid
in
the
specific
search,
not
for
some
more
systemic
purpose
of
criminal
administration.
unknown
speaker
well,
wouldn't
there
be...
wouldn't
there
be
some
purpose
too
to
take
along
someone
who
was
a
lawyer
in
case
you
run
into
some
uncertain
fourth
amendment
situation?
can
you
go
ahead
and
break
down
this
door
or
should
you
get
a
warrant
or
something
like
that?
unknown
speaker
well,
does
it
then
all
boil
down
to
the
value
that
the
media
provide
to
law
enforcement
when
they
go
into
the
house.
is...
is
that
the
nub
of
the
case?
unknown
speaker
that's
what
we
have
to
value
against
the
privacy
intrusion.
unknown
speaker
do
you
say
here
that
the
value
of
having
media
coverage
of
this
particular
execution
of
a
search
warrant
outweighs
the
privacy
interests
of
the
ranchers
who
were
searched?
unknown
speaker
whose
property
was
searched.
unknown
speaker
well,
let's...
let's
assume
for
the
moment,
since
it
hasn't
been
decided,
that
some
of
these
outbuildings
were
within
the
curtilage
and
therefore
the
same
rules
would
apply
as...
as
to
the
home
itself.
now,
how
do
you
weigh
that
balance
if
it...
if
it
involves
that?
let's
say
a
search
of
the
home.
unknown
speaker
so,
how...
how
do
we
weigh
the
balance
where
maybe
there
is
in
some
broad
sense
a
value
to
having
public
information
about
it
but,
on
the
other
hand,
is
a
very
weighty
interest
on
the
part
of
the
homeowner
to
have
privacy
within
the
home?
unknown
speaker
we
have
valued
that
very
highly.
unknown
speaker
so,
how
do
we
weigh
that
balance
in
your
view?
unknown
speaker
but
inside
the
home.
unknown
speaker
well,
but
i...
i
didn't
pose
arrest
warrant.
i
posed...
which
is
involved
in
the
other
case...
a
search
warrant
for
items
executed
in
the
home
or
within
the
curtilage.
unknown
speaker
mr.
cordray,
could...
could
i
pursue
the
value
to
law
enforcement
that...
that
having
the
media
along
is?
unknown
speaker
i...
you
say
in
assistance
of
law
enforcement.
i...
i
assume
the
means
that
to
assure
that
everything
is
open
and
above
board,
that
they're
not
being
brutal,
that
they're
not
exceeding
the
limits
of
their
authority.
is
that
right?
unknown
speaker
what
is
it
beyond
that
other
than
pr
which--
unknown
speaker
--just
photographing
them
going
into
the
building
saying
these
officers
are,
you
know,
going
in
and...
and
they're
going
to
do
a
search.
do
you
have
to
be
there
while
they're
opening
dresser
drawers?
unknown
speaker
it
seems
to
me
the
principal
value
you're
appealing
to
is
the
value
of
making
sure
that...
that
law
enforcement
is
conducted
fairly
and
properly.
nobody
has
a
greater
interest
in
that
than
the
person
being
searched.
so,
why
don't
you
just
ask
the
person,
before
you
bring
in
the
television
news
crew,
you
know,
we're
going
to
do
you
a
favor.
to
make
sure
that
this--
[laughter]
--that
this
search
is
going
to
be
absolutely
fair,
we
have
a
television
crew
along.
would
you
like
them
to
come
in
to
be
sure
that
this
search
will
be
very
fair?
unknown
speaker
it
seems
to
me
they
ought
to
if
that's
the
principal
value
of--
unknown
speaker
--my...
my
point
is
why
don't
you
ask
the
homeowner
if
he
wants
that
protection?
why
force
it
upon
him
when
he'd
rather...
he
trusts
the
police
force
and
values
his
privacy
more.
unknown
speaker
well,
i...
i
suppose
too
that
some
sort
of
photographic
presence
might
uphold
the
validity
of
the
search
against
complaints
by
the...
the
person
who's
being
searched.
unknown
speaker
are
there
no
photographers
other
than
those
in
the
media?
couldn't
you
bring
along...
i
thought
there
were
police
photographers.
unknown
speaker
i
take
it
you're
not
arguing
here
that
the
photographers
were
brought
along
because
there
was
no
available
police
photographer.
unknown
speaker
mr.
cordray,
as
i'm
listening
to
your
argument
and
you
keep
saying
no
per
se
rules
and
it
depends
on
what
the
particular
facts
and
circumstances
are,
i
have
a
certain
deja
vu
feeling,
and
it
relates
to
the
old
days
when
this
court
was
trying
to
draw
a
luggage
line,
telling
the
police
they
couldn't
search
the...
the
green
suitcase
but
they
could
search
the
paper
bag,
and
then
finally
they
decided
in
ross,
no.
the
police
have
to
know
going
in
what
they
can
do
and
what
they
can't
do.
and
your
argument
seems
to
me
to
be
going
back
to
the
time
when,
well,
we'll
decide
after
the
fact
and
there
will
be
no
rules
going
in.
isn't
there
some
real
importance
to
being
able
to
tell
the
police
in
advance
what's
okay
and
what
isn't?
unknown
speaker
now,
we
also
have
an
issue
i
guess
in
the
hanlon
case
concerning
audiotapes
that
were
made
that...
while
the
officers
and
the
media
were
in
the
house.
unknown
speaker
should
we
make
any
distinction
between
audiotapes
and
videotapes?
unknown
speaker
your
argument
so
far
lays
the
groundwork
for
you
to
talk
about
the
second
question
which
is
whether
or
not
these
principles
were
clearly
established.
perhaps
you
could
address
that.
unknown
speaker
well,
the
fourth
amendment
doesn't
talk
specifically
about
wiretapping,
but
it
certainly
talks
about
houses
and
personal
effects.
unknown
speaker
well,
isn't
there
a
distinction
between
going
into
somebody's
home
and...
and
wiretapping?
i
mean,
going
into
people's
homes
has
been
something
considered
questionable
under
the
common
law
going...
for
many,
many
years.
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
we
can
charge
the
officers
with
knowledge
of
semayne's
case
or
the
principle
in
semayne's
case?
unknown
speaker
they
might
have
questioned
how
frequently
it's
done.
you
rely
heavily
on
the
marshals
service
policy.
unknown
speaker
well,
you
do
rely
on
that
heavily,
do
you
not?
unknown
speaker
well,
let
me
just
ask
you
a
question
about
the
marshals--
unknown
speaker
--can
you
point
to
me
the
part
of
the
policy
that
makes
it
clear
they
could
take
people
into
the
home?
i
didn't
find
that
in
what
cited
to
me.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
thought
the
sheriff,
the
montgomery
county
sheriff,
in
his
deposition
testified
that
permitting
civilians
to
enter
a
home
during
the
execution
of
a
warrant
wasn't
permitted
there.
unknown
speaker
well,
that
might
have
been
clearly
established
at
least
in
montgomery
county.
unknown
speaker
well,
in
wilson
v.
layne,
the
facts
were...
were
pretty
extreme
in
terms
of
an
invasion
of
privacy
in
the
home.
it
occurred
in
the
early
hours
of
the
morning
when
the
couple
were
asleep
and
were
not,
you
know,
adequately
dressed.
i
mean,
it
was
an
amazing
invasion.
and
you
think
on
that
balance
that
we
would
not
be
concerned
about
the
privacy
interests
in
that
situation
simply
because
it
was
an
arrest
warrant?
unknown
speaker
but
you
think
we
should
have
a
clear
rule
that
in
executing
an
arrest
warrant,
you
can
take
outsiders
in
who
aren't
there
to
help
with
the
execution
of
the
arrest
warrant?
unknown
speaker
that
might
be
a
very
easy
clear
line
to
draw.
unknown
speaker
very
well,
mr.
cordray.
mr.
fletcher-hill,
we'll
hear
from
you.
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask...
suppose
it
had
been
clearly
established
that
it
was
a
common
law
tort
to
bring
the
media
into
a
home,
but
there
had
been
no
decision
on
interpreting
section
1983
or
the
fourteenth
amendment.
would
you
think
under
those...
under
that
assumption
there
would
be
qualified
immunity?
unknown
speaker
well,
assume
that...
assume
that
we
on
the
first
time
we...
we
decide
yes,
it's
a
clear
violation.
the
only
issue
we
have
to
face
is,
should
the
officers
have
been
aware
that
they
shouldn't
go
in
if
their
only
restraint
on
going
in
was
a
well-established
common
law
rule...
a
common
law
tort
rule.
unknown
speaker
don't
you
think
it's
a
clearly
established
constitutional
principle
that
it
is
unreasonable
to
commit
a
tort
in...
in
the
course
of
the
search?
i
mean,
once
you...
i
mean,
i
think
it's
an
open
question
of
whether...
whether
it
was
clear
that
this
was
a
tort,
but
if
it
was
a
tort,
i
think
the
game
is
up.
surely
you're
not
authorized
to
commit
a
tort
in
the
course
of
a
search.
unknown
speaker
wouldn't
that
make
the
search
automatically
unreasonable?
do
you
need
a
case
that
says
that?
unknown
speaker
well,
supposing
you...
you
have...
during
a
search
or
an
arrest
an
officer
commits
what's
later
decided
to
have
been
an
assault
and
battery.
you...
you
run
up
against
the
person
in
a
way
a
court
says
there
wasn't...
that
wouldn't
make
it
invalid
under
the
fourth
amendment,
would
it?
unknown
speaker
there
occurs
to
me
an
even
better
answer
than
that
which
is
that
the
open
fields
doctrine
explicitly
says
that
you
can
commit
a
tort
and
not
violate
the
fourth
amendment.
unknown
speaker
that's
true.
but
would
you
take
me
through
the
officer's
thinking,
the
thinking
of
the
reasonable
officer?
he
knows
that
the
fourth
amendment
protects
the
security
of
a
person
in
his
house
against
an
unreasonable
search.
he
knows
that.
unknown
speaker
he
knows
a
police
officer
normally
has
to
get
a
warrant...
normally...
before
he
can
go
into
that
house
in
order
to
protect
that
privacy.
he
has
to
have
a
very
good
reason
to
intrude
on
that
privacy.
now,
a
person
knowing
that...
why
wouldn't
he
think,
well,
obviously
you
can't
bring
in
a
person
who
isn't
even
mentioned
in
the
warrant,
which
person
is
going
to
broadcast
personal
things
to
10
million
people?
i
mean,
if
the
lesser
is
forbidden,
why
isn't
it
obvious
that
the
greater
is?
and
so,
what
i...
what
i
want
you
to
do
is
to
explain
what's
the
thinking
of
a
person
who
knows
the
lesser
is
forbidden,
but
nonetheless
he
thinks
it's
reasonable
to
do
the
greater.
unknown
speaker
it
couldn't...
it
couldn't
be
more
important
to
broadcast
this
than
it
is
to
do
the
search
in
the
first
place.
so,
why
wouldn't
you
at
least
have
to
have
it
in
the
warrant?
unknown
speaker
does
the
warrant
refer
to
the...
they
have
a
right
under
the
warrant
to
bring
in
the
press?
does
it
say
anything
about
the
press?
unknown
speaker
in
fact...
if
i
may
interrupt...
doesn't
the
warrant
say
just
the
contrary?
doesn't
the
warrant
expressly
limit
itself
to
officials,
to
police
officers
of
some
sort?
unknown
speaker
okay.
so,
the
terms
of
the
warrant
limit
it
to
peace
officers.
how
could
an
officer
therefore
reasonably
believe
that
under
the
authority
of
that
warrant
he
could
take
in
other
people
regardless
of
what
the
general
law
might
be
if
the
warrant
were
less
exact
in
specifying
those
to...
to
whom
it
gave
authority?
unknown
speaker
well,
but
there
was
a
federal
statute
i
believe
in
effect
at
the
time.
it
may
still
be
in
effect
as
far
as
i
know
in
18
u.s.
code
3105,
and
it
says,
a
search
warrant
may
in
all
cases
be
served
by
any
of
the
officers
mentioned
in
its
direction
or
by
an
officer
authorized
by
law
to
serve
such
warrant,
but
by
no
other
person,
except
in
aid
of
the
officer
on
his
requiring
it,
he
being
present
and
acting
in
its
execution.
now,
how
do
you
read
that
statute
as
allowing
private
citizens
or
media
ride-alongs?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
suppose
it
isn't
the
fact
that
the
statute
limits
the
number
of
people
who
can
serve
the
warrant,
doesn't
in
so
many
words
say
that
nobody
else
can
come
along.
unknown
speaker
well,
if...
if...
if
we
take
the
word
serve
to
mean
those
who
may
in
fact
be
present,
then
i
take
it
you're...
you're
out
of
luck.
there's
no
basis
for...
for
arguing
qualified
immunity
because
there's
no
basis
for...
for
arguing
any
colorable
authority.
unknown
speaker
so,
you're
arguing
that
cases
from...
from
other
states
which...
which
may
have
condoned
this
in
the
past
override
the
terms
of
your
warrant
in
deciding
what
it
is
reasonable
for
your
officers
to
do.
is
that
correct?
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
well,
i...
i...
if...
if
we...
if
it
is
reasonable
to
read
it
as
excluding
others
from
participating
in
the
execution
of
the
warrant,
then
i
take
it
by
its
terms
your...
your
argument
would
be
excluded.
unknown
speaker
their
argument
basically
is
the
marshals
service
told
us
we
could
do
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
but
when...
when
you
say
ride-along,
are
you
saying
that
it
was
a
common
law
enforcement
practice
to
bring
the
media
into
the
house
in
the
execution
of
an
arrest
warrant?
unknown
speaker
well,
but
in
wilson
v.
layne,
we
know
what
the
montgomery
county
sheriff
said,
and
he
said
it
wasn't
the
policy.
unknown
speaker
well,
were
they
on
loan
in
the
sense
that
they
were
required
to
follow
orders
from
the
marshals
service?
you
spoke
of
their
predicament,
and
i'm
not
sure
that
i
know
what
the
predicament
is.
were
they...
had
they
taken
some
kind
of
an
oath
to
do
what
the
marshals
service
told
them
to?
unknown
speaker
so,
they
were
subject
to
line
authority.
unknown
speaker
thank
you,
mr.
fletcher-hill.
unknown
speaker
mr.
rossbacher,
we'll
hear
from
you.
is
it
rossbacher
or
bacher?
unknown
speaker
mr.
rossbacher.
unknown
speaker
is
it
your
position
that
if
the
warrant
does
not
specifically
authorize
people
other
than
peace
officers
to
serve
it
that
no
such
person
can
be
brought
along?
unknown
speaker
even
if
it
were,
for
instance,
a
search
warrant
in
connection
with
a...
a
theft
ring
and
the
owner
of
the
property
was
brought
along
to
identify
the
goods
or
some
expert
in
fingerprinting
was
brought
along
or
something
like
that?
unknown
speaker
you
say
absolutely
not.
unknown
speaker
well,
but--
unknown
speaker
--just
a
minute,
mr.--
unknown
speaker
--in...
in
answer
to
my
question,
you
say
that
a
person
such
as
justice
o'connor
described
could
be
brought
along.
unknown
speaker
and
that
it's
not...
not
necessary
to
authorize
it
in
the
warrant.
unknown
speaker
well,
the
warrant
doesn't
say
anything
about...
typically
it
doesn't.
it
authorizes
certain
police
officers
to...
to
execute
the
warrant.
and
we're
interested
in
exploring
whether
under
your
view
other
people
brought
in
by
the
officers
to
help
them
identify
goods,
to
take
fingerprints,
whatever
it
might
be,
to
take
photographs
for
them,
for
the
police...
now,
is
that
all
right
even
though
they
are
not
explicitly
named
in
the
warrant
and
although
the
warrant
doesn't
talk
about
such
people?
unknown
speaker
how
about
the
attorney
in
the
hanlon
case
who
went
along?
unknown
speaker
you
say
authorize,
mr.
rossbacher.
what
do
you
mean
by
the
word
authorize?
do
you
mean
permitted
under
the
fourth
amendment
or
specifically
authorized
in
some
other
way?
unknown
speaker
but
if
he
had
been
there
to
perform
a
law
enforcement
function,
it
would
have
been
all
right?
unknown
speaker
well,
now,
where...
where
does
all
that
come
from?
you
say
designated.
that's
all
under
3105?
unknown
speaker
what
about
the
law
students
in...
in
the
clinic,
in
the
law
school
clinic,
as
part
of
their
educational
program
are
riding
along
with
the
police,
going
in
with
the
police
wherever
they
go?
unknown
speaker
well,
what...
what
can
in
your...
in
your
view,
consistent
with
the
fourth
amendment,
what
can
the
academic,
the
student,
do
in
the
way
of
a
ride-along?
what
would...
what
would
the
limits
be?
unknown
speaker
i'm
giving
you
an
example
of
a
person
who
isn't
there
to
identify
anything.
he's
not
to
aid
the
police.
he's
there
to
be
educated,
to
observe,
and
to
advance
his
own
education.
unknown
speaker
and
so,
i'd
like
to
know...
he's
in
the
squad
car,
such
a
person.
can
he
ever
leave
the
car,
or
he's
just
waiting
for
the
police
as
they
go
in
and
out
to
search,
to
seize?
unknown
speaker
just
a
slight
variation
on
justice
ginsburg's
hypothetical.
suppose...
just
assume
this
is
right,
but
the...
the
optimum
number
of
police
for
a
search
is...
of
a
house
is
five.
but
they
bring
along
two
police
trainees,
and
they
say,
now,
you
just
watch.
is
that
permitted?
unknown
speaker
no,
they're
not
there...
they're
there
just
for
training
purposes.
unknown
speaker
so,
the
police
have
no
way
to
train
their...
train
their
new
recruits,
their...
their
rookies.
unknown
speaker
now,
you
say
private
property.
how
about
the
entry
onto
the
ranch
lands
in
hanlon?
unknown
speaker
armed
with
a
warrant.
now,
is
there
any
violation
of
the
fourth
amendment
by
virtue
of
strangers
to
the
execution
of
the
warrant
accompanying
the
officers
on
the
open
lands
in...
in
hanlon?
unknown
speaker
and
what
do
you
rely
on
for
that?
because
there...
we
have
cases
dealing
with
a
so-called
open
fields
exception.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
think
the
balance
may
well
be
different
within
a
home
or
within
closed
structures
in
the
curtilage
than
it
is
in
open
areas
where
presumably
anyone,
the
mailman
or
anybody
else,
can
drive
up
to
the
ranch
house
but
can't
enter
the
house.
unknown
speaker
but
we
don't
have
that
question
before
us.
unknown
speaker
the...
the
problem
with
that
in
your
case
is
the
open
fields
doctrine
might
mean
that
the
rules
here
are
not
so
well
established.
unknown
speaker
it's
a
murky
doctrine.
unknown
speaker
the
ninth
circuit--
--well,
the
lower
courts
have
decide...
the
ninth
circuit
said
there
was.
and
we're
not
going
to--
--we...
we
don't
reevaluate
those
things
here.
unknown
speaker
the
court
of
appeals
said
there
was
consent.
so,
take
it...
take
it
from
us--
unknown
speaker
--we're
not
interested.
unknown
speaker
do
you
agree,
mr.
rossbacher,
that
the
agents
did
not
search
when
they
were
in...
when
they
were
in
the
home?
unknown
speaker
well,
apart
from...
apart
from
the
recording,
is
it
your--
unknown
speaker
--contention
that
they...
that
they
conducted
a
search
of
the
house?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
mean,
i...
i
have
a
lot
of
people
come
into
my
house.
i
don't
think
everybody
who
comes
into
my
house
is
searching
my
house.
unknown
speaker
that...
that's
out
of
the
case
as
the
chief
justice
has
said.
we
assume--
unknown
speaker
--that
they
entered
pursuant
to
consent.
having
entered
pursuant
to
consent,
did
they
search?
unknown
speaker
in...
in
any
respect
other
than
making
the
recording?
unknown
speaker
i
didn't
ask
whether
they
went
through
the
rooms.
people
who
come
into
my
house
go
through
the
rooms.
unknown
speaker
they
didn't
search.
unknown
speaker
if
it
was
a
search,
does
your
position
imply
that...
suppose
they
had
found
something
in
the
house...
that
that
evidence
would
have
to
be
suppressed?
unknown
speaker
my
assumption
is
that
it
would
have
been
all
warranted
because
they
did
have
a
warrant.
unknown
speaker
were
it
not
for
the
media...
so,
in
other
words,
i'm
giving
you
a
situation
where
the
police
had
just
gone
in
on
their
own,
executed
the
warrant,
they
would
have...
they
would
have
done
everything
according
to
law.
that
bringing
the
media
along
you
say
makes
it
unlawful.
and
my
question
is,
to
what
extent
do
you
go...
does
the
media
presence
so
taint
the
operation
that
what
would
otherwise
have
been
lawfully
seized
becomes
unlawfully
seized?
unknown
speaker
not
the
media.
the
police...
the
police
did--
unknown
speaker
--but
they
did
it
in
the
presence
of
the
photographers
who
got
it
all
live
for
cnn.
unknown
speaker
so,
you're...
so,
you're
now
giving
me
a
different
answer
than
the
one
you
gave
me
initially.
you
say--
unknown
speaker
--well,
you
told
me
i
thought
initially...
or
maybe
i
didn't
phrase
the
question
so
that
you
were
able
to
answer
it
precisely.
i
asked
you
would
the
exclusionary
rule
apply
to
evidence
seized
under
a
warrant
but
in
the
presence
of
the
press
and
captured
on...
on
the
press
camera.
unknown
speaker
but
the
evidence
found
by
the
police
might
fall
within
the
inevitable
discovery
exception.
i
mean,
they're
going
to
go
in
with
a
warrant
and
find
what
they
find,
wouldn't
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
no.
the
assumption
we
were
talking
about
was
officers
with
a
warrant
finding
the
evidence
and
nonetheless
having
the
presence
of
the
media.
unknown
speaker
counsel,
do
you
know
whether
there
are
instances
in
which
warrants
have
expressly
permitted
the
inclusion
of
media
in--
unknown
speaker
--in
a
search
warrant?
unknown
speaker
your
complaint
is
that
they
didn't
actually
concentrate
on
the...
what
the
officers
were
doing,
but
simply
conducted
their
own
search?
unknown
speaker
well,
you
wouldn't...
you
wouldn't
say
that
would
be
okay
either,
would
you?
unknown
speaker
but
even
if
it
were,
your
argument
is
exactly
the
same.
unknown
speaker
i'm
not
sure
3105
really
speaks
to
the
issue
because
it
talks
about
search
warrants
and
it
tells
who's
authorized
to
serve
the
search
warrant.
it
doesn't
say
anything
about
who
may
go
along.
unknown
speaker
those
cases
aren't
binding
on
us.
unknown
speaker
you
can
argue
as
to
the
clearly
established
point.
unknown
speaker
well,
not
to
be
searched.
but
there...
you
know,
if
you're
saying
that
the
media
did
their
own
search,
you
have
a
stronger
case
under
3105
than
if
the
media
simply
accompanied.
unknown
speaker
your
time...
your
time
is
expired,
mr.
rossbacher.
unknown
speaker
thank
you.
mr.
willard,
we'll
hear
from
you.
unknown
speaker
well,
they
say
that's
what
they
were
there
to
do.
they
had
a
warrant
and
that's
why
they
were
there.
unknown
speaker
that's
the
argument.
unknown
speaker
--wilson.
unknown
speaker
well,
wouldn't
it
be
true
that
the
media
would
never
be
there
to
assist
in
execution
of
the
warrant.
it's
hard
to
see
how
they
could
be
of
assistance.
unknown
speaker
the
trainee
hypothetical
was
designed
to
probe
whether
or
not
there
are
any
systemic
interests
that
the
law
enforcement
has
extending
beyond
the
specific
search,
and
that
would...
that
was
why--
unknown
speaker
--i
mean,
for
trainees,
don't
they
build,
you
know,
facilities
to
train
trainees?
i
know
they
do
it
for
firearms.
they
don't
take
them
along
to
just,
you
know,
on
the
job
training.
they--
[laughter]
why
can't
they
do
the
same
thing
for
searches?
i
assume
they
could--
unknown
speaker
--could
they...
the...
i'll
assume
with...
i
assume
you're
right.
assume
for
the
sake
of
argument.
assume
too
that
it's
odd
that
the
fourth
amendment,
which
puts
all
these
protections
around
a
smaller
invasion
of
privacy,
wouldn't
fairly
clearly
prohibit
a
much
bigger
one
with
less
purpose.
now,
still...
i'm
assuming
that.
still,
a
policeman
might
have
read
some
cases
and
thought
i
could
bring
along...
you
know,
assuming
he
knows
all
the
statutes
and
cases...
i
can
bring
someone
along
to
help
me.
all
right?
in
aid
of.
and
now
he
thinks,
well,
this
is
in
aid
of
because
of
the
publicity,
because
of
the
law
enforcement
need
for
public
relations,
et
cetera,
et
cetera.
now,
wrong
though
he
may
be,
is
that
enough
to
grant
him
qualified
immunity
in
the
absence
of
cases
going
the
other
way?
i'd
like
you
to
focus
right
on
that
because
i
find
that
difficult.
unknown
speaker
what
he
thinks
is
what
we
know
he
thinks.
he
thinks
i
have
a
policy
here.
the
policy
is
further
a
u.s.
marshals
service
policy.
it's
a
general
help.
it
helps
build
support
for
law
enforcement
in
the
community,
all
the
things
you've
heard.
and
he
says,
i...
i
think
this
word
in
aid
of,
which
i've
seen
in
the...
which
he
hasn't,
but...
but
the
words
in
aid
of
deserve
a...
constitutionally
a
broad
interpretation.
now,
so
he's
thinking
that.
is...
is...
now,
what's...
is
he...
that's
what
i
want
you
to
focus
on.
why
isn't
that
enough
to
get
him
over
the...
the
hurdle--
unknown
speaker
--of
the
need
for
clear
establishment
of
the
principle?
unknown
speaker
is
that
the
moncrief
and
higbee
cases?
unknown
speaker
does
the
fact
that
they
didn't
even
mention
the
fourth
amendment
help
you
or
hurt
you?
unknown
speaker
do
you
want
to
add
anything
in
respect
to
the
common
sense
bit?
i
mean,
i'm
willing
to
assume
there's
no
case
that
says
anything
explicitly
one
way
or
the
other
here.
it's...
without
any
cases
at
all,
i'll
say
a
person
ought
to
know
you
don't
have
a
greater
intrusion
of...
but
that
same
person,
since
we're
going
on
common
sense,
might
think
he
could
bring
a
long
a
person
in
aid
of.
so,
i'm...
i'm
focusing
you
on
what
i
call
the
common
sense
of
the
situation
rather
than--
--and
add
to
the
mix
the
existence
of
a
u.s.
marshals
service
policy
that
says
it's
okay.
so,
add
to
that
mix
and
then
what
is
the--
unknown
speaker
--mr.
willard,
what
about
the
law
professor
and
her
students?
unknown
speaker
they're
going
along
simply
as
a
learning
experience.
they're
observing.
unknown
speaker
they
didn't
have
any
law
students
in
1603.
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
it's
hardly
hypothetical
as
of
the
1970's,
1980's,
and
1990's.
law
schools
do
have
these
programs.
unknown
speaker
what
justice
breyer
and
justice
o'connor
are
asking
is
also
what...
what
concerns
me.
we're
concerned
that
there
might
have
been
an
understanding
in
the
law
enforcement
community
that
these
ride-alongs
were
okay.
that
might
be
wrong.
but
does...
doesn't
that
indicate
that
the
right
is
not
clearly
established?
unknown
speaker
well,
but
you're
putting
the
burden
on
the
wrong
side.
it
doesn't
have
to
be
clearly
established
that
it
was
okay.
it's
your
burden
to
show
that
it
was
clearly
established
that
it
was
not
okay.
and
so,
the
so-called
agnostic
justice
department
guidelines
cut
against
you.
they
are
not
neutral.
it
seems
to
me
it's
your
burden
to
show
that
it
was
a
clearly
defined...
it
was
understood
to
be
a
violation
of
the
constitution.
unknown
speaker
but
the...
i
think
the
difficulty
i
have
with
your
argument
is
that
i
think
you
will
concede...
i'm
going
to
ask
you
in
a
second,
but
i
think
you
will
concede
that
there
is...
that
there
was
at
no
time
relevant
here
a
clearly
established
line
that
no
one
but
law...
law
enforcement
authority
in
the
strict,
deputized,
sworn
sense
of
the
word
could
come
in
to
exercise...
in
the
exercise
of
the
warrant.
and
i'm
going
to
ask
you,
don't
you
concede
that
had
there
been
a
reasonable
need
for
a
translator
outside
the
department,
a
translator
could
be
brought
in?
do
you
concede
that
the
owner
of
property
could
be
brought
in
if
it
might
be
property
that
would
be...
be
difficult
to
identify?
would...
would
you
agree
that
those
people
who
are
not
sworn
law
enforcement
officers
could
come
in
in...
at
least
in
aid
of
the
execution
of
the
warrant?
unknown
speaker
so,
we...
we
can't
start
then,
even
if
we
accept
your
view
of
how
the...
the
privilege...
the
burden
on
who
has
to
establish
what
clearly...
even
if
we
accept
your
view
on
that,
we
can't
start
with
the
simple
bright
line
that
there
was
a
clearly
established
principle
that
nobody
but
sworn
law...
law
enforcement
officers
could
go
in.
we've
got
a...
we've
to
a
murkier
line
to
begin
with,
haven't
we?
unknown
speaker
but
the--
unknown
speaker
--that...
that
depends
very
much
on
an
interpretation
of
section
35
which
is...
05
which
is
perfectly
permissible,
but
by
no
means
the
only
one,
that
when
it
says
how
such
a
warrant
should
be
served,
that
defines
the
number
of...
that
defines
the
maximum
number
of
people
who
may
accompany
the
officer.
and
certainly
that
isn't
clear
on
the
face
of
the
statute
to
me.
unknown
speaker
well,
they
were
committing
a
trespass
unless
they
fall
within
this
concept
of
being
in
aid.
and
your
view
of
what
is
in
aid
is
that,
you
know,
a
relatively
specific
level
of
generality.
it's
got
to
be
in
aid
of...
in...
in
relation
to
the
specific
details
of
the
search,
identifying
the...
the
stolen
goods,
being
able
to
communicate
with
the
people
in
the
house,
and
so
on.
but
the...
the
police's
argument
is
that,
well,
it's
still
in
aid,
but
at
a
somewhat
higher
level
of
generality.
it's
in
aid
because
we
live
in
a
political
world
and
we've
got
to
show
that
we're
doing
our
job
in
to...
for
the
voters
to...
to
give
us
an
appropriation
or
for
congress
to
think
it's
getting
its
money's
worth.
and...
and
isn't
that
what
creates
the
murk?
the
murk
is
involved
in
deciding
just
what
is
sufficiently
in
aid,
how
specific
that
aid
must
be.
and
isn't
that
the
nub
of
the...
the
problem
on
qualified
immunity?
unknown
speaker
i'm
still
wondering
about
your
answer
to
justice
scalia.
as...
as
i
understand
your...
your
construct,
you
have
to
show
that
there's
a
general
rule
that
you
cannot
enter
the
house.
given,
and...
and
we'll...
we'll
assume
that
that's
easy
to
establish.
second,
you
say
that
it's
up
to
the
police
to
establish
that
there
is
an
exception.
why
isn't
it
up
to
you
to
establish
that
there
is
no
exception?
unknown
speaker
is
the
answer
to
this
question
no?
you
have
some
cases
that
show
that
there
are
certain
people
you
could
bring
in,
the
translator,
the
property
identifier.
and
now
if
i
say
were
there
any
cases
that
you
found
anywhere
about
people
you
couldn't
bring
in
aid,
you
couldn't
find
any.
is
that
right?
unknown
speaker
no,
no.
but
we
didn't...
we
don't
have
any
case
up
there
that
says,
and
by
the
way,
it
violates
the
fourth
amendment
to
bring
along
this
kind
of
person,
an
ice
cream
vendor
or
something.
no
such
case.
unknown
speaker
although...
although
he
also
knows
that
he
can
trespass
in
the
open
fields
without
violating
the
first
amendment
i
suppose.
unknown
speaker
can
i
ask
you
about
your
interpretation
of
section
3105?
it's
on
page
46
of
the
red
brief
in...
in...
in
the
hanlon
case.
it
says,
a
search
warrant
may
in
all
cases
by
served
by
any
of
the
officers
mentioned
in
its
direction
or
by
an
officer
authorized
by
law
to
serve
such
warrant.
now,
it
has
to
be
your
position
that
serve
there
really
means
execute.
right?
is
that
your
position?
which
i
suppose
you
say
is
supported
by...
by
the
latter
part
of
it
because
it
goes
on,
but
by
no
other
person,
except
in
aid
of
the
officer
on
his
requiring
it,
he
being
present
and
acting
in
its
execution.
unknown
speaker
and
it's
your
position
that
the
mention
of
execution
towards
the
end
of
that
provision
indicates
that
when
they're
talking
about
serving
a
warrant,
they
mean
serving
and
executing.
unknown
speaker
it
wouldn't
do
too
much
if
it
just
specified
who
can
deliver
the
warrant
to
the...
or,
i
mean,
you
know.
you
could
have
a
messenger
do
that
i
suppose.
it
doesn't
really
make
a
whole
lot
of...
there's
not
a
whole
lot
of
importance
to
the
merely
delivering
the
paper.
unknown
speaker
mr.
willard,
what...
what
if
the
warrant
says,
so
a,
b,
c,
d,
and
e,
f
shall
serve
the
warrant
and
accompany,
and
then
a
fourth
law
enforcement
officer
they
decide
to
take
along
at
the
last
minute
because
they
hear
there's
some
sort
of
a
rumble
out
at
the
place
where
they're
going
to
serve.
now,
is...
is
that
bad?
unknown
speaker
but
a
private
purpose
that...
that
helped
the
police
or
the
police
thought
helped
the
police.
unknown
speaker
but
especially
if
we're
in
doubt,
it's
very
close.
does
the
first
amendment
get
some
weight
which
would
be
weighed
against
you?
unknown
speaker
can
we
distinguish
this
from
the
other?
unknown
speaker
--only
thinking
of--
unknown
speaker
--thank
you,
mr.
willard.
mr.
cordray,
you
have
3
minutes
remaining.
unknown
speaker
how
do
we
know
that...
that
not
just
ride-alongs
but
entering
with
the
execution
of
a
warrant
was
engaged
in
frequently?
what...
what
is
your
evidence
for
that?
unknown
speaker
what
did
they
base
it
on?
was
there
evidence
to
that
effect
in
the
case?
unknown
speaker
but
i'm
not
sure
of
the
relevance
of
that
because
there
have
been
instances
of
police
who
have
been
doing
things
that...
pursuant
to
clear
policy
where
the
policy
was
clearly
unconstitutional.
unknown
speaker
so...
so,
are
we
supposed
to
give
any
weight
to
the
fact
that...
that
there's
some
book
in
which
somebody
has
an
interpretation--
unknown
speaker
--or
even
practice?
unknown
speaker
can
we
say--
unknown
speaker
--can
we
say
it
is
widely
engaged
in
in
execution
of
warrants
as
distinct
from
visiting
crime
scenes?
because
if
there's
a
crime
scene,
robbery,
body
lying
on
the
floor
or
something,
nobody
normally
is...
is
worried
about
warrants.
i
know
they
come
to
crime
scenes.
does
the...
does
the
case
evidence
take
us
beyond
crime
scenes
to
warrant
execution?
unknown
speaker
no.
i'm
talking
about
cases.
you...
you
referred
to
two
cases
in
particular.
unknown
speaker
do
they
go
beyond
crime
scenes
to
execution
of
warrants?
unknown
speaker
no,
no,
no.
but
crime
scenes
versus
warrants.
apparently
they
don't
discuss
that
distinction--
unknown
speaker
--well,
you...
you
make
that
argument
and
you
say
it's
a
marginal
intrusion.
i
don't
see
why
the
case
would
be
different,
for
example,
if
there
were
3
police
officers
and
17
reporters.
i...
i
don't
know
why
that
should
make
any
difference.
it's
still
a
violation
of
privacy.
unknown
speaker
all?
