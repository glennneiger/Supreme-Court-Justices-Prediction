mr.
lawrence
r.
fletcher-hill
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
there
are
two
fundamental
facts
that
establish
the
qualified
immunity
of
the
three
deputy
sheriffs
i
represent.
the
first
of
those
is
that
the
most
able
lawyer
researching
this
issue
in
1992
would
have
found
no
cases
from
any
court
condemning
the
mere
presence
of
media
when
a
warrant
is
executed
lawfully
as
a
constitutional
violation.
the
only
cases
then
in
existence,
in
fact,
held
to
the
contrary,
that
media
presence
at
most
was
a
tort
under
common
law
principles
if...
if
the
media
was
brought
inside
a
home.
the
second
point
is
that--
mr.
lawrence
r.
fletcher-hill
--no,
your
honor.
i
think
it
would
still
be
an
open
question
whether...
whether
this
court
would
eventually
incorporate
those
common
law
principles
into
the
fourth
amendment.
mr.
lawrence
r.
fletcher-hill
no,
because
the...
the
doctrine
of
qualified
immunity
would
operate
only
as
to
the
constitutional
principles.
there
may
be
other
immunities
for
the
officers
concerning
the
common
law,
and
in
fact,
one...
one
could
find
the
situation
where
the
common
law
would...
would
suggest
to
these
officers
that
they
should
not
do
this.
but
as
a
matter
of
fourth
amendment
jurisprudence
and
the
bivens
or
1983
action
against
the
officers,
i
think
the
law
would
still
not
be
clearly
established
as
a
matter
of
constitutional
principle.
mr.
lawrence
r.
fletcher-hill
no,
your
honor.
mr.
lawrence
r.
fletcher-hill
let
me
give
an...
an
illustration.
the
technical
issue
of
trespass
may
be
such
that
in
the
absence
of
a
warrant,
something
would
clearly
be
a
trespass.
but
if
the
officer
is
in
the
position
under
fourth
amendment
jurisprudence
of
having
authority
to
come
into
the
house
based
on
a
warrant,
then
that
potential
superior
authority
of
the
officer
would
overcome
the
tort
violation.
mr.
lawrence
r.
fletcher-hill
that's
correct.
you...
you
would
still
have
the
issue
under
the
fourth
amendment,
but
whether
that
use
of
force,
which
might
admittedly
be...
be
a
battery
at
common
law,
is
justified
by
the
need
to
control,
under
michigan
v.
summers,
the
people
who
are
in
the...
the
premises
where
the
warrant
is
being
executed.
mr.
lawrence
r.
fletcher-hill
well,
your
honor,
in
many
cases
the...
the
tort
issue
and
the
constitutional
issue
are
going
to
overlap
very
closely.
but
in
fact,
this
case,
the
wilson
case,
provides
a
good
illustration
of
where
they
don't
overlap
and
where
i
think
there's
an
important
distinction.
the
common
law
has
arisen
in
the
area
of
invasion
of
privacy
to
take
care
of
situations
of
publication.
mr.
lawrence
r.
fletcher-hill
that's
correct.
mr.
lawrence
r.
fletcher-hill
your
honor,
the...
the
thinking
of
the
officers
in
this
case
is
that,
of
course,
it
is
a
serious
proposition
to
enter
someone's
house
without
consent
to
make
an
arrest,
but
these
officers
had,
matching
that
issue,
valid
arrest
warrants
which
they
knew
gave
them
clear
authority
to
enter
the
house.
mr.
lawrence
r.
fletcher-hill
no.
the...
your
honor,
i
think
the
entry
into
the
house
is
met
by
the
presence
of
the
warrant.
the
secondary--
mr.
lawrence
r.
fletcher-hill
--no.
i
think
the
issue
of
the--
mr.
lawrence
r.
fletcher-hill
--your
honor,
that's
correct.
the
warrant
is
directed
to
peace
officers.
mr.
lawrence
r.
fletcher-hill
these
officers
could
believe
that
because
at
the
time
they
operated,
they
were
operating
under
the
direction
of
the
marshals
service.
the
media
presence
was--
mr.
lawrence
r.
fletcher-hill
--if
applicable
at
all,
that
statute
would
be
applicable
only
to
the
hanlon
case
which
was
a
search
warrant
and
not
to
the
officers
here
who
were
executing
an
arrest
warrant.
mr.
lawrence
r.
fletcher-hill
that's
correct.
and
we
have
made
no
claim
here
that...
that
the
media
are
entitled
to
help
serve
the
warrant.
the
officers
must
stay
within
the
clear
bounds
of
their
authority
under
the
warrant
in
serving
it.
the
media
there...
are
there
as
mere
observers.
mr.
lawrence
r.
fletcher-hill
well,
your
honor,
i
think
a
great
deal
of
authority
has...
has
come
down
to...
for
the
proposition
that
non-law
enforcement
personnel
may
be
present
during
the
service
of
both
search
warrants
and
arrest
warrants
without--
mr.
lawrence
r.
fletcher-hill
--no.
the
terms
of
this
warrant
only
say
that
a...
a
peace
officer
is
to
execute
the
warrant.
mr.
lawrence
r.
fletcher-hill
and
peace
officers
in
this
case
in
fact
did
execute
the
warrant.
the...
the
media
personnel
did
not
do
anything
to
execute
the
warrant.
mr.
lawrence
r.
fletcher-hill
it
would
exclude
on
the
substantive
violation,
but
i
don't
think
it
would
exclude
the
issue
of
clearly
established
right
because
it
would
still
be
the
case
that
these
officers
armed
with
those
warrants
would
be
operating
under
a
marshals
service
policy
arranged
at
the
direction
of
others
whom
they
did
not
have
a
reason
to
question
and
regular
on
its
face,
that
is,
the
media
participation--
mr.
lawrence
r.
fletcher-hill
--no.
at
the
time
that
these
officers
acted,
it
was...
it
was
a
common
law
enforcement
practice
to
have
ride-alongs.
there
was
no
contrary
authority
from
any
court--
mr.
lawrence
r.
fletcher-hill
--i...
i
think
the
existence
of
a
number
of
cases
where
exactly
that
happened--
mr.
lawrence
r.
fletcher-hill
--that's
true,
and
i
think
if
anything,
those
statements
by
sheriff
kight
illustrate
the
predicament
of
these
officers
because
what
sheriff
kight
also
said
was
as
to
this
operation,
he
understood
his
own
officers
to
be
operating
under
marshals
service
guidelines
which
did
permit
this
activity,
and
he
himself
would
not
condemn
the
conduct
of
his
own
officers
at...
at
this
time
in
1992
because
they
were
on
loan
to
the
marshals
service
and
not
operating
under
his
own
office's
policies.
mr.
lawrence
r.
fletcher-hill
in
fact,
two
of
them
were...
were
deputized
for
purposes...
as
deputy
u.s.
marshals
for
purposes
of
this
operation.
mr.
lawrence
r.
fletcher-hill
the...
the
authority
under
that
program
was
directed
from
mr.
layne,
from
deputy
u.s.
marshal
layne,
as
the
supervisor
in...
in
this
geographic
area.
mr.
lawrence
r.
fletcher-hill
thank
you,
your
honor.
