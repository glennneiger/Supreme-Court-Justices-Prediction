mr.
david
c.
frederick
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
concerns
whether
an
office
of
inspector
general
investigator
interviewing
a
federal
unionized
employee
for
alleged
misconduct
is
a,
quote,
representative
of
the
agency
who
must
allow
the
participation
of
a
union
representative
under
the
federal
service
labor-management
relations
statute.
the
flra
and
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
the
oig
agent
is
such
a
representative
either
because
the
inspector
general
is
under
the
control
of
agency
management
or
because
the
office
of
inspector
general
investigative
work
product
provides
a
benefit
to
agency
management.
both
theories
are
mistaken.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
yes,
it
is,
justice
scalia,
appointed
by
the
president.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
no.
the
president
can
remove
the
officers
in
the
flra.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
this
court
has
made
clear
on
numerous
decisions,
justice
scalia,
that
this
particular
statutory
scheme
is
permissible
and
acceptable
and
that
the
courts
are
the
appropriate
place
to
resolve
disputes
that
arise
between
the
flra
and
agency
management.
and
this
case
is
no
different
from
those
other
types
of
disputes.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
i'm
not
an...
i
am
not
prepared
on
the
federal
power
commission.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
if
i
could
return
to
this
case,
the
control
theory
upon
which
the
court
below
based...
part
of
its
theory
is
based
on
a
mistaken
construction
of
the
inspector
general
act,
a
statute
that
is
outside
the
flra's
expertise.
although
the
inspector
general
act
requires
that
the
inspector
general
be
under
the,
quote,
general
supervision
of
the
head
of
the
agency,
that
requirement
does
not
transform
the
inspector
general
into
a
representative
of
the
agency.
rather,
the
general
supervision
requirement
requires
the
inspector
general
to
comply
with
the
generally
applicable
rules
and
regulations
of
the
agency,
such
as
procurement
rules,
equal
employment
opportunity
regulations,
limitations
on
outside
employment
by
the
federal
employees
that
are
partisan,
political--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--deference--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--two
reasons,
justice
o'connor.
first,
that
interpretation
rests
not
so
much
on
an
interpretation
of
what
representative
of
the
agency
means,
but
an
application
of
that
to
the
inspector
general
act.
the
theory...
and
i
have
given
two
theories.
one
is
that
the
control
by
the
agency
representative
constitutes
who
a
representative
of
the
agency
is.
the
flra
is
wrong
about
that
because
they
have
misconstrued
the
inspector
general
act.
they
are
not
entitled
to
deference
because
that
is
not
a
statute
within
their
expertise.
the
second
theory
is
that
the
ig
provides
a
benefit
to
agency
management.
the
flra
is
not
entitled
to
deference
under
that
theory
for
several
reasons.
first,
their
interpretation
that
any
entity
that
provides
a
benefit
to
agency
management
is...
is
seriously
overbroad.
that
construction
departs
from
the
purposes
behind
the
labor
statute
and
it
would
also
encroach
on
an
inspector
general's
independence.
it
would
reach
not
only
an
agency's
inspector
general,
but
it
would
also
apply
to
federal
and
state
law
enforcement
officers
who
investigate
criminal
wrongdoing
by
agency
employees
and
submit
an
investigative
report
to
the
head
of
the
agency
who
then
uses
that
report
for
disciplinary
purposes.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
justice
scalia,
the
answer
is
no,
and
the
reason
is
that
there
is
nothing
in
the
inspector
general
act
that
gives
the
flra
authority
to
construe
the
provisions
of
that
statute
just
as
this
court
in
the
atf
case
held
that
the
flra
was
not
entitled
to
deference
in...
in
construing
the
travel
allowance
statute,
which
is
a
statute
that
was
outside
its
area
of
presumed
expertise.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
that's
correct,
justice
o'connor.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
yes,
it
is,
justice
o'connor.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
well,
there
are
two
bases
on
which
it
has
done
that,
and...
and
let
me
try
again.
what
a
representative
is
depends
upon
the
application
of
various
other
laws,
and
the
basis
of
their
decision
is...
is
based
on
two
theories.
one
is
that
a...
to
be
a
representative,
one
has
to
be
under
the
control
of
agency
management.
to
answer
that
question,
you
have
to
look
to
the
inspector
general
act,
which
is
the
statute
that
the
flra
has
no
particular
expertise
in
construing,
and
they
simply
misconstrued
that
statute.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
i
have
several
responses
to
that,
justice
ginsburg.
first,
the
weingarten
decision
itself
was
based
on
equalizing
the
balance
of
power
between
labor
and
management.
it...
it...
as
has
been
construed
in
subsequent
decisions,
it
does
not
include
those
employees
who
are
not
unionized.
it
does
not
include
outside
law
enforcement
agencies.
it
only
includes
management
interviewing
a
unionized
employee
for
the...
so
that
the
rights
that
were
collectively
bargained
would
not
be
undermined
by
management
by
using
the
investigatory
process.
that
concern
is
not
present
here
because
the
inspector
general
is
precluded
from
participating
in
the
collective
bargaining
process
and
is
not
part
of
that
process.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
that
was
a
factor,
justice
ginsburg,
but
as
we
have
quoted
in
our
main
brief
at
pages
20
to
21
from
the
court's
weingarten
decision
at
pages
260
to
261,
the
safeguard
is
to
redress
the
perceived
imbalance
of
economic
power
between
labor
and
management.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
that's
correct,
mr.
chief
justice.
and
it's
also
clear
that
if
a
person
is
not
an
employee
or
is
not
a...
a
person
as
defined
under
the
federal
labor
statute,
that
person
cannot
invoke
the
rights
under
the
weingarten
statute.
at
present
approximately
45
percent
of
the
non-uniformed
federal
work
place...
work
force
cannot
invoke
these
weingarten
rights.
so,
it
is
perfectly
clear
that
what
congress
was
intending
to
get
at
was
the
balance
of
power
between
management
which
would
negotiate
collective
bargaining
agreements
and
the
unionized
work
force
which
would
be
on
the
other
side
of
that--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--well,
that
would
be--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--no,
justice
breyer,
it
is
not.
and
it
is
reasonable
if
management
is
conducting
the
interview,
and
we
would
concede
that
in
those...
throughout
the
federal
government
in
virtually
every
department,
management
conducts
interviews
for
disciplinary
purposes
of
employees.
and
in
those
contexts,
it
is
perfectly
appropriate
for
a
union
representative
to
be
present
at
that
interview.
but
an
inspector
general
investigation
is
not
an
interview
that
is
being
conducted
by
or
for
agency
management.
agency
management
doesn't
have
the
authority
to
designate
the
inspector
general
to
do
anything,
to
order
the
inspector
general
to
designate
what
the
inspector
general--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--no,
it
would
not,
justice
breyer.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
in
the
private
sector,
if
an
fbi
agent
shows
up
at
a
company
to
interview
an
employee
who
is
accused
of
criminal
wrongdoing,
there
is
no
weingarten
right.
and
the
reason
why
there
is
no
weingarten
right
is
that
the
fbi
doesn't
represent
the
corporation's
management.
in
the
same
way
here,
the
inspector
general
is
provided
with
independence
within
a...
within
the
agency
so
that
it
does
not
represent
agency
management--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--yes.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
yes,
because--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--the
pinkerton
control...
the
pinkerton
agency
would
be
within
the
control
of
agency
management,
and
it
would
simply
be
a
designatee...
a
designatee
of
agency
management.
here
the
agency
manager
is
precluded
by
the
terms
of
the
inspector
general
act
from
ordering
the
inspector
general
to
conduct--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--that's
correct.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
that's
correct,
but
that
doesn't
transform
the
inspector
general
into
an
agents...
anymore
than
the
fbi
is--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--no.
the
distinction,
justice
stevens,
is
that--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--that...
that's
correct.
and
here
the
focus
is
on
whether
the
inspector
general
is
an
independent
entity,
and
that
is
where--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--no.
in
fact,
that's...
that's
not
true
because
the...
an
independent
contractor
would
be
designated
by
the
head
of
the
agency.
here
this
person,
the
inspector
general,
is
not
being
designated
by
the
head
of
the
agency.
rather,
the
inspector
general
act
provides
organic
authority
for
the
inspector
general
to
conduct
such
investigations
as
he
or
she
deems
necessary
or
desirable,
to
obtain
the
documents
within
an
agency
that
the
inspector
general
thinks
are
necessary
to
conduct
the
investigations.
the
inspector
general
is
required
to
keep
confidential
the
criminal
information
that
he
obtains
or
she
obtains.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
i
can't
give
you
that
percentage,
but
what
i
can
tell
you
is
that
approximately
15
percent
of
the
nasa-oig's
investigative
caseload
concerns
employee
misconduct
cases.
the
other
85
percent
deal
with
other
types
of
criminal
misconduct
by
persons
that
are
outside
the
agency
attempting
to
perpetuate
a
crime
against
the
agency.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
certainly,
but
that
also
does
not
transform--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--yes,
just
as
an
agency
head
has
requested
the
fbi
to
conduct
an
investigation
too,
and
that
doesn't
transform
the
fbi
into
a
representative.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
that's
correct,
which
further
indicates
the
insulation
of
the
inspector
general's
investigative
function.
the
inspector
general
can't
show
up
and
order
an
employee
to
submit
to
an
interview,
just
as
an
inspector
general
who
finds
evidence
of
wrongdoing
has
no
authority
to
punish.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
no,
i
don't
think
so,
justice
kennedy,
because
this
shows
that
the
inspector
general
has
to...
in
order
to
complete
his...
his
function,
has
to
do
what
he
does,
and
then
the
agency
manager
does
what
he
or
she
does.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
that's
correct,
justice
o'connor.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
it's
the
same
in
an
fbi
interview.
if
if...
if
a
federal
employee
does
not
want
to
submit
to
an
interview
by
the
fbi,
the
agency
manager
can
order
the
federal
employee
to
submit
to
that
interview,
but
that
doesn't
transform
the
fbi
into
a
representative
of
agency
management
either.
and
in
the
disciplinary
function,
the
ig
has
no
role
whatsoever.
once
the
investigation
is
completed
and
the
report
is
transmitted
to
the
head
of
the
agency,
that
process
carries--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--they
have
hinted
in
their
decision
in
this
case,
which
is
at
43a
of
the
petition
appendix
in
footnote
23,
that
the
d.c....
and
they're
referring
to
a
d.c.
circuit
case
which
pointed
out
that
the
flra's
construction
would
also
apply
to
the
fbi
in
the
context
of
an...
of
an
investigation
done
of
a
department
of
justice
employee.
and
they
have
pointed
out
there
that
there
is
a
statute
which
they
construe
to
exempt
the
fbi
in
certain
circumstances.
that
statute
is
28
u.s.c.
535(a).
but
i
would
like
to
give...
i
would
like
to
point
out
to
this
court
that
that
statute
has
been
seriously
misconstrued
by
the
flra.
that
statute
was
enacted
in
1954
to
resolve
the
dispute
that
had
arisen
between
the
treasury
department
and
the
department
of
justice
over
whether
or
not
fbi
employees
could
investigate
wrongdoing
committed
by
treasury
employees.
the
dispute
that
had
arisen
had
blocked
the
fbi
basically,
and...
and
congress
passed
this
statute
to
ensure
that
the
fbi
would
have
jurisdiction
to
investigate
those
matters.
the
house
report
which
accompanies
that...
it's
house
report
2622
at
pages
2
to
3,
published
in
1954...
makes
perfectly
clear
that
that
statute
was
not
intended
to
change
anything
about
investigative
procedures.
it
was
simply
jurisdictional,
to
provide
the
fbi
with
concurrent
jurisdiction
so
that
it
also
could
investigate
allegations
of
wrongdoing.
if
the
flra
is
correct
in
this
construction
of
the
statute,
it
would
only
apply
to
title
18
offenses,
as
by
the
plain
terms
of
535(a).
it
would
not
apply
to
drug
offenses
in
title
21
or
money
laundering
in
title
31
or
anti-kickback
and
public
contracting
offenses
in
title
41
or
in
harboring
a...
an
immigrant
or
a
fugitive
under
title
8.
so,
the
flra
in
relying
on
this
statute,
has...
has
construed
the
phrase,
notwithstanding
any
other
provision
of
law,
in
a...
in
a
very
erroneous
way.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
could
i
just
have
one
point,
though,
justice
ginsburg?
and
that
is
that
the
flra
has
held
that
in
a
joint
investigation
by
the
fbi
and
an
inspector
general,
that
the
weingarten
rights
are
appropriate
under
the
theory
that
the
information
is
shared
with
agency
management.
and
the
nasa-oig...
two-thirds
of
its
investigations
are
criminal
investigations,
and
over
half
of
those,
nearly
60
percent,
are
joint
investigations
with
another
law
enforcement
agency
like
the
fbi
or
the
department
of
defense.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
when
they
are
being
investigated
by
the
inspector
general.
when
they
are
being
investigated
by
agency
management,
they
are
still
entitled
to
have
a
union
representative.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
no.
they
had
an
internal
affairs
committee
that
did
internal
affairs
investigations.
this
happened
throughout
the
government,
justice
ginsburg,
as
amendments
to
the
inspector
general
act
were
made.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
it
would
be
no
different
than
if,
instead
of
creating
an
office
of
inspector
general,
congress
had
said,
we
want
the
investigative
function
of
the
agency
transferred
from
under
agency
management's
control
and
given
to
the
fbi.
there
would
be
no
difference.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
it's
a
policy
decision
that
congress
made
to
create
entities
that
would
be
developing
particular
expertise,
sources
of
information,
and
have
expert
knowledge
of
the
kinds
of
wrongdoing
and
other
frauds
and
abuses
that
might
be
committed
within
federal
agencies.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
justice
souter,
that
would...
that
would
impose
a
penalty
on
an
inspector
general
for
violating
something
in
the
collective
bargaining
relationship
to
which
the
inspector
general
is
not
a
party.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
yes,
there
is,
justice
souter,
for
two
reasons.
first,
the
agency
head
would
be
given
extraordinary
leverage
to
decide
how
independent
an
inspector
general
could
be
by
being
able
to
bargain
over
the
inspector
general's
independence
in
exchange
for
concessions
by--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--my
second
point
then
i
hope
will
satisfy
you
is
that
nothing
in
either
statute
would...
gives
the
flra
the
authority
that
it
asserts
in
this
case,
which
is
to
decide
on
a
case-by-case
basis
whether
or
not
the
prerogatives
of
the
inspector
general,
as
defined
in
the
inspector
general
act,
have
been
defeated.
the
flra
has
no
expertise
in
law
enforcement
matters,
and
it
is...
is
attempting
to
arrogate
to
itself
the
authority
to
decide
on
a
case-by-case
basis
whether
the
inspector
general
act
is
being
hindered
by
particular
demands
made
by
the
union.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
i
don't
think
so,
justice
souter.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
because
it
requires
you
to
determine
that
an
inspector
general
is
under
the
control
of
agency
management.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
and
the
inspector
general
does
not--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--yes.
it's
overbroad.
it
interprets
representative
far
broadly
and
sweeps
in
outside
law
enforcement
agencies
as
well.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
it
would
make
the
fbi
a
representative
of
the
agency--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--an
internal
department
of
justice
investigation
of
a
department
of
justice

if
i
can
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
justice
kennedy,
i'd
like
to
return
to
your
question
about
who
the
ig
reports
to
because
executive
order
12993,
which
is
not
cited
in
the
briefs,
provides
that
the
president
shall
engage
a
process
to
investigate
wrongdoing
by
an
inspector
general.
so,
in
those
instances
when
the
inspector
general
and
the
agency
head
are
at
loggerheads,
pursuant
to
this
delegated
authority,
the
deputy
of
the
office
of
management
and
budget
convenes
a
committee
called
the
president's
committee
of
integrity
and
efficiency.
the
pcie
investigates
outside
the
realm
of
the
agency
whether
or
not
the
inspector
general
has
committed
any
wrongdoing,
and
pursuant
to
that
process,
the
agency
head
is
basically
taken
out
of
the
disciplinary
process
through
the
investigation
of
whether
or
not
the
ig
has
committed
wrongdoing.
so,
in
answer
to
your
earlier
question,
the
ig
really
reports
not
only
to
congress
through
those
mechanisms
created
in
the
inspector
general
act,
but
also
to
the
president
who
has
the
authority
to
appoint
and
to
remove
and
to
create
this
mechanism
for
the
discipline
of
the
inspector
general.
that
creates
a
further
insulation
and
independence
of
the
inspector
general
in
performing
its
function.
i
would
also
like
to
point
out
that
the
remedy
that
the
flra
asserts
in
this
case
runs
against
the
agency
and
the
agency,
therefore,
has
to
be
able
to
have
the
authority
to
direct
the
inspector
general
to
comply
in
a
certain
way.
and
that's
exactly
contrary
to
the...
to
the
prerequisites
of
the
inspector
general
act
which
provide
for
investigative
independence
on
the
part
of
the
inspector
general
in
conducting
investigations.
allowing
a
union
representative
in
these
contexts
allows
the
union
representative
to
serve
as
an
advance
beacon
of
all
of
those
types
of
questions
that
an
inspector
general
might
ask
not
only
of
the
worker
who
is
being
investigated,
but
also
of
the
coworkers,
and
in
the
d.c.
circuit
case,
in
which
the
d.c.
circuit
held
that
a
union...
that
an
ig
was
not
a
representative,
the
court
there
specifically
noted
the
problem
where
the
worker
had
confided
to
the
union
representative
having
committed
a
number
of
crimes
and
the
d.c.
circuit
there
held
that
the
ig
was
not
the
representative.
