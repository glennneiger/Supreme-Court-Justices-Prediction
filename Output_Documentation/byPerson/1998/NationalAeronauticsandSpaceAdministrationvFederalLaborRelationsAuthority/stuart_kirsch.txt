mr.
stuart
kirsch
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
that
the
oig
investigator
was
acting
here
as
representative
of
the
agency
is
manifested
in
a
multitude
of
activities
that
actually
occurred
and
is
also
consistent
with
the
roles
and
duties
and
responsibilities
under
the
ig
act.
here
we
had
an
ig
investigator
at
the
outset
invoke
the
disciplinary
authority
of
the
agency.
this
is
not
a
right
inherent
to
the
ig,
but
one
that
is
routinely
unleashed...
this
disciplinary
hammer...
upon
employees
to
compel
their
attendance
and
to
assure
that
they
cooperate
fully
and
answer
all
questions.
this
was
not
an
isolated
situation
in
this
nasa
case.
to
review
the
second
circuit
case
and
the
d.c.
circuit
case,
agents
that
were
specifically
appointed
and
selected
by
the
oig,
who
are
not
oig
agents
since
they
have
the
authority
to
gain
further
assistance
from
others
within
the
office,
those
agents
also
advise
the
employees
that
they
must
appear
or
they
will
face
dismissal.
mr.
stuart
kirsch
typically
it
is
correct,
i
would
say,
that
an
agency
will
instruct
the
employee
to
appear
before
the
ig.
the
ig
apparently
implicitly
adopts
an
authority,
an
apparent
authority,
because
there
was
nothing
in
the
record
here
or
in
any
of
these
cases
that
it
can
invoke
the
disciplinary
authority
of
the
agency.
whether...
whether
they
have
that
or
not,
the
appearance
is
certainly
clear
and
they
hold
themselves
out
as
having
the
disciplinary
authority
of
the
agency.
moreover,
here
we
have
an--
mr.
stuart
kirsch
--yes.
mr.
stuart
kirsch
in
this
case
we
had
a
referral
from
the
fbi
to
the
oig.
the
oig
then
contacted
the...
the
agency
and
told
them
that
we
have
some
concerns
about
the
activities
of
an
employee.
management
then
issued
a
letter
of
discipline
to
the
employee
to
immediately
remove
him
from
the
facility
and
to
impose
a
fitness
for
duty
exam.
within
several
days,
the
oig
sought
to
set
up
an
interview
to
be
conducted
of
this
employee.
they
agreed
to
allow
the
employee
to
have
an
attorney
and
a
union
representative
present
at
the
attorney's
office
in
this
particular
case,
and
that's
when
they
said
that
the
employee
must
answer
all
questions
or
face
dismissal.
mr.
stuart
kirsch
nothing
about
specifically
that
he
has
to
tell--
mr.
stuart
kirsch
--but--
mr.
stuart
kirsch
--yes.
mr.
stuart
kirsch
yes,
and
also--
mr.
stuart
kirsch
--the
oig
has
duties
and
responsibilities
vis-a-vis
the
agency
head
and
access
to
certain
information
that
others
outside
an
agency
would
not
have.
typically,
as
we
said
from
the
outset,
an
employee
is
directed
to
appear
before
the
oig
who
has
a
physical
location
at
that
office.
they
have
access
to
all
documents
and
access
to
the
agency
head
at
any
time.
they
have
the
right
to
select,
appoint,
and
employ
any
official
to
work
with
them
as
part
of
that
oig
investigation.
moreover,
they
have
the
duty
and
responsibility
to
recommend
corrective
action
wherever
they
see
fraud,
waste,
and
abuse
to
the
agency
head.
so,
in
a
number
of
respects,
there
is
an
interaction
between
the
two.
mr.
stuart
kirsch
by...
by...
he
can
tell
him
to
not
assert
the
disciplinary
authority
of
our
agency
here
to
compel
the
attendance
of
our
employees,
if
he
so
chose
to
do
that.
but
apparently
they
don't
do
that
and
so
they
by...
by
implicitly
allowing
the
ig
to
go
in
and
exercise
that
authority
of
the
agency,
that
compels
the
attendance
of
the...
of
the
employees
there.
mr.
stuart
kirsch
yes.
mr.
stuart
kirsch
there's
nothing
in
the
oig
act
that
gives
the
oig
subpoena
power
over
a
particular
employee
within
his
agency,
and
there's
nothing
that
could
compel
the
employee
to
appear
there
and
to
fully
cooperate
other
than
disciplinary--
mr.
stuart
kirsch
--i'm
sorry.
mr.
stuart
kirsch
if
he
was
not
compelled
in
this
particular
case,
the...
the
statute
says
compelled
to
appear
before
any
agency...
then
he
would
be
entitled
to
counsel.
correct.
mr.
stuart
kirsch
perhaps
he
may
not
have
been
entitled
to
counsel
unless
there
was
a
custodial
interrogation,
a
criminal
type
investigation,
or
some
way
otherwise
overbearing
the
will
of
the
individual--
mr.
stuart
kirsch
--if
he...
the
statute...
you
are
both
correct...
indicates
where
an...
where
an
employee
is
compelled
to
appear
before
the
agency.
now,
that
compulsion
may--
mr.
stuart
kirsch
--that's
exactly
our
position,
that
absent
an
affirmative
statement
that
you
don't
have
to
be
there,
the...
the
appearance
is
clear
to
any
employee
that
their
job
is
in
jeopardy
for
refusal
to
participate
or
cooperate
fully
in
an
investigation.
and
the
compulsion
exists
both...
either
through
the
circumstances
or
the
specific
statements
here.
moreover
here,
we
have
a
situation
where
an
agency
routinely
utilizes
the
information
that's
gathered
by
the...
by
the
investigator
for
purposes
of
going
forward
with
the
discipline
in
the
case,
and
often
where
the
ig
testifies
on
behalf
of
the
agency
where
an
employee
contests
that
particular
discipline.
the...
one
statement
about
the
fbi,
if
i
may.
the
fbi
is
specifically
excluded
under
the
labor
statute
from
coverage
as
an
agency.
so,
the
issue
would
not
even
apply
with
respect
to
the
fbi.
moreover,
the
fbi
has--
mr.
stuart
kirsch
--they're
explicitly
excluded
by
definition
of
being
an
agency
and
therefore
would
not
be
subject
to
the
provisions
of
the
labor
statute
in
any
respects.
mr.
stuart
kirsch
an
exclusive
fbi
investigation,
yes,
that
would
be
correct.
the...
and
as
i
attempted
to
take
you
through
the
ig
act,
as
you
can
see,
the
only
authority
of
an
ig
to
act
for
or
on
behalf
of
the
agency
is
by
virtue
of
that
employee's
existence
and
creation
as
a
vehicle
of
that
agency.
the
legislative
history
says
that
this
ig
is
to
be
the
strong
right
arm.
thank
you
very
much.
