unknown
speaker
mr.
frederick,
before
you
get
too
far
into
it,
how
is
the
flra
appointed?
is
it
a
independent
agency?
unknown
speaker
but
once
appointed,
cannot
be
removed
by
him?
unknown
speaker
well,
if
all
of
the
agencies
don't
like
this
ruling
that
the
flra
has
come
up
with,
why
don't
they
just
tell
the
president
to...
you
know,
to
tell
them
to
shape
up
or
ship
out
and
put
in
people
who
will
agree
with
what
the
agencies
want?
why
do
you
come
to
us
to
solve
this
internal
executive
branch
problem?
unknown
speaker
you're
right.
we've
done
it
before,
but
i
must
say,
it
just
seems
surpassing
strange.
i
mean,
here
you
have
the
agencies...
usually
when
you
have
a
disagreement
among
the
agencies,
you
go
to
the...
you
go
to
the
chief
executive
and
you
say,
you
know,
the
fbi
and
the
cia
are
in
disagreement.
tell
us
which
one
is
going
to
prevail.
we
had
the
federal
power
commission
suing
the
department
of
interior
50
years
ago,
60
years
ago
here
in
this
court.
so,
this
is
nothing
unusual.
well,
the
power...
isn't
the
power
commission
an
independent...
wasn't
the
power
commission
an
independent
regulatory
agency?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
think
it
was
so
the
president
couldn't
control
it.
now,
whatever
the
constitutionality
of
that,
i
could
understand
why
you
had
to
come
here,
but
here
you
have
two
agencies
one
agency
against
the
rest
of
the
government,
all
of
them
within
the
control
of
the
president,
and...
well,
all
right.
you
say
we've
done
it
before.
i
guess...
i
guess
that's
enough
of
an
answer,
but
it
seems
surpassing
strange.
unknown
speaker
well,
mr.
frederick,
normally
we
would
defer
to
the
agency
interpretation
of
the
meaning
of
the
language,
and
here
the
flra
wants
to
tell
us
that
they
interpret
this
language
of
representative
of
the
agency
as
including
the
inspector
general.
unknown
speaker
so,
why
don't
we
defer?
unknown
speaker
could
i
come
to
your
first
point?
you
say
the
flra
does
not
have
the
expertise.
is...
is
that
the
criterion
for
whether
we
give
deference?
thought
it
was
rather
whether
the
agency
was
acting
within
its
scope
of
administration.
if
it's
a
field
that
the
agency
has
been
given
authority
over,
whether
or
not
it's
very
expert,
even
if
in
this
aspect
of
it
it
may
not
know
any
more
than
courts,
if
it
has
been
given
authority
over
that
area,
we
generally
defer.
and
hasn't
the
flra
been
given
authority
over
this
area
to...
to
stop
this
or
to
permit
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
thought
the
statute
we
were
construing
was
5
u.s.
code,
section
7114
(a)(2)(b).
is
that
right?
unknown
speaker
is
that
within
the
jurisdiction
of
the
flra?
unknown
speaker
so,
why
can't
it
say
what
is
meant
by
the
term
a
representative
of
the
agency?
unknown
speaker
but,
mr.
frederick,
i
didn't
understand
them
as
doing
that.
i
thought
they
said,
well,
we're
dealing
with
a
statute
that
codifies
the
weingarten
rule.
so,
the
focus
of
our
inquiry
is,
first
and
foremost,
the
person
who's
supposed
to
benefit
from
that
rule,
the
employee
who
was
there
alone
confronted
by
the
employer
with
an
allegation
of
serious
misconduct,
frightened
and
needful
of
help.
that's
what
the
weingarten
rule
was
meant
to
take
care
of,
and
that's
what
the
flra
has
in
its
charge.
and
then
it
says,
for
this
purpose
and
this
purpose
only,
does
the
inspector
general
represent
the
agency
vis-a-vis
that
employer?
and
it
was
only
in
that
very
limited
sense
with
the
first
view
of
flra
its
bailiwick,
which
is
we've
got
this
statute
that
codifies
the
weingarten
rule.
what
was
weingarten
supposed
to
do?
unknown
speaker
what
was
the...
all
the
language
in
weingarten...
and
i
realize
that
weingarten
itself
is
not
what's
before
us,
but
7114...
that
the
employee
may
be
too
fearful
or
inarticulate
to
relate
accurate...
accurately
the
incident
being
investigated?
that
doesn't
sound
like
we're
concerned
about
equalizing
bargaining
power
across
the
table
over
an
agreement,
but
the
concern
is
262
to
263
of
weingarten
where
the
court
speaks
of
the
fearful,
inarticulate
employee
who
may
not
be
able
to
relate
accurately
the
incident
that's
being
investigated
or
being
too
ignorant
to
raise
extenuating
circumstances.
unknown
speaker
the...
the
statute
says
an
exclusive
representative
of
an
appropriate
unit
in
an
agency
shall
be
given
the
opportunity
to
be
represented.
the
representation
is
of
the
union.
it
isn't
of
the
individual.
unknown
speaker
why
wouldn't
congress
have
just
wanted
to,
just
thinking
about
it
crudely,
say,
well,
if
a
person
who
can
afford
it
can
have
his
lawyer
in
the
room,
many
of
those
who
can't
afford
it
could
have
their
union
rep?
i
mean,
the
union
rep
would
just
represent
the
same
kind
of
thing,
not
in
every
case,
but
by
and
large...
protect
the
individual,
particularly
ones
who
can't
afford
to
pay
for
the
lawyer.
i
mean,
maybe
they
didn't
think
that
at
all,
but
that's
my
question.
why
wouldn't
they...
why
wouldn't
you
want
that?
unknown
speaker
why
isn't
that
a
reasonable
interpretation
of
what
congress
was
doing
here?
unknown
speaker
no,
that's
right.
but,
i
mean,
my...
my
question
is
really
just
focusing
on
assuming
it's
linguistically
possible,
is
it
a
reasonable
interpretation
of
what
congress
might
have
been
after?
i
mean,
obviously,
if
congress
is
trying
to
protect
the
individual
by
giving
him
a
right
to
have
his
union
rep
present,
this
would
be
the
classic
case
where
he
needs
the
protection.
unknown
speaker
all
right.
well,
that's
what
i
would
like
you
to
explain.
unknown
speaker
would
the
weingarten
right
apply
in
the
private
sector
if
the
employer
hired
the
pinkerton
detective
agency
to
come
in
and
conduct
the
interview?
unknown
speaker
it
would
apply.
unknown
speaker
why
isn't
that
the
same
as
this?
unknown
speaker
no,
but
doesn't
the
statute
provide
that
there...
that
they
report
to
and
under
the
general
supervision
of
the...
of
the
agency?
unknown
speaker
and
wouldn't
they
normally,
if
they
discovered
some
kind
of
employee
misconduct,
report
it
to
the
agency?
unknown
speaker
no,
but
the
whole
purpose
of
the
weingarten
rule,
it
seems
to
me,
is
duplicated
in
that...
in
that
setting.
unknown
speaker
i
understand
that
they
have
to
be
a
member
of
the
bargaining
unit
and
so
forth,
but
that's...
this
fellow
was
a
member
of
the
bargaining
unit,
wasn't
he?
unknown
speaker
well,
he's
like
an
independent
contractor.
he's
got
some
control
and
some
independence.
unknown
speaker
mr.
frederick,
inside
of
an
agency
like
this
one
with
an
inspector
general,
what
percentage
of
the
employee
misconduct
would
go
to
an
ordinary
manager
and
what
percentage
would
be
under
the
wing
of
the
inspector
general?
unknown
speaker
does
it
ever
happen
that
the
agency
head
would
request
the
inspector
general
to
make
an
investigation?
unknown
speaker
it's
not
an
order,
but
i
guess
the
agency
can
request
it.
unknown
speaker
and
i
guess
the
agency
head
has
to
order
the
employee
to
appear
and
be
available.
unknown
speaker
well,
it
seems
to
me
your
case
would
be
stronger
if
he
did
have
that
authority.
unknown
speaker
well,
but
now,
if
the
employee
doesn't
want
to
cooperate
with
the
interview,
is
it
the
employing
agency
that
says
if
you
don't,
i'll
discipline
you
or
fire
you?
unknown
speaker
so,
there
is
to
that
extent
control
over--
unknown
speaker
--what
position
does
the
flra
take
concerning
an
fbi
investigation
or
a
grand
jury
investigation?
have
they
said?
unknown
speaker
mr.
frederick,
i...
i
understood
the
flra
to
take
the
position
that
the
fbi
and
external
agencies,
grand
juries
are
not...
are
out
of
this,
and
perhaps
it
would
be
best
for
the
flra
to
speak
for
itself
on
that
point.
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
you
a
question
about
something
that
is
in...
in
your
agency's
domain
and...
or
at
least
in
the
executive
domain?
there's
just
been
a
change
for
the
irs.
now
they
have
a
real
inspector
general.
up
until
now
the
members
of
the
union,
nteu,
have
had
the
union
representative
with
them.
now
those
same
people,
i
take
it,
will
no
longer
have
the
representative
because
of
the
new
installation
of
an
inspector
general.
is
that
right?
unknown
speaker
well,
they
had
something
that
was
pretty
close
to
an
inspector
general,
but
not
quite.
right?
unknown
speaker
but
in
any
event,
there
were
people
who...
doing
the
same
thing
now
that
they...
if
they
had
done
it
a
year
ago,
would
have
the
union
representative
with
them
and
now
will
no
longer.
unknown
speaker
well,
there
is...
there
is
a
difference
between
a
wholly
external
agency,
an
fbi
or
cia,
and
something
that's
still
under
the
roof
of
the...
of
the
department.
unknown
speaker
but...
but
maybe
what
that
argues
for
is
that
we've
really
got
a...
a
third
alternative
here,
and
instead
of
looking
at
it
in
an
either/or
situation,
there's
a
new
possibility.
let's
assume
that
we
conclude
that,
in
fact,
the...
the
statute
does
guarantee
the...
the
right
to
have
the
presence
of
the
union
rep.
might
it
be
the
case
that...
that
where
things
are
going
wrong
here
is
in
assuming
that
the
agency,
for
purposes
of
an
unfair
labor
practice
determination,
is
the
normal
head
of
the
agency,
as
distinct
from
the
inspector
general
for
that
agency.
the
reason
i
suggest
that
is
the
object
of
the
unfair
labor
practice
determination
is
to
change
the
behavior
of
management.
well,
the
agency
here
is
being
represented,
to
the
extent
that
it's
represented
at
all,
by
the
inspector
general.
conversely,
management
in
the
sense
of
the
usual
line
of
authority
can't
control
the
inspector
general.
is
it
open
to
us
here
to
conclude
that,
number
one...
and
i
realize
you
disagree
with
this...
that
the...
that
there
is
a
guarantee
of
the
rep
at
the
interview,
but
that
any
determination
of
unfair
labor
practice
has
to
run
against
the
inspector
general
as
opposed
to
running
against
the
agency
in
the
usual
sense?
unknown
speaker
well,
he's
not
a
party,
but
he...
he
has...
he
certainly
has
as
much
knowledge
or
is
entitled
to
as
much
knowledge
of
the
collective
bargaining
arrangement
as
the...
as
the
normal
head
of
the
agency
is.
and...
and
the
point
is,
if
you're...
i
mean,
the
rationale
is
if
congress
wants
these
investigations
to
be
done
not
by
the
fbi
but
within
the
agency
itself,
there's...
there's
nothing
conceptually
odd
about
saying
that
they've
got
to
be
done
within
the...
the
confines
of
the
agreements
that
the
agency
has
made,
including
a
collective
bargaining
agreement.
and
as
long
as
the
inspector
general
has
access
to
it
and
has
as
much
chance
to
know
what's
going
to
violate
it
as
the
nominal
head
of
the
agency
would,
there's...
there's
nothing
odd
about
saying
that
the...
that
the
inspector
general
should
be
bound
by
it.
unknown
speaker
well,
that
might
violate
the
statute
creating
the
inspector
general.
i'm
assuming
that
we've
got
a
situation
like
this
in
which
there
is...
there
is
no
claim
that
there
is
a...
a...
in
effect,
a...
a
statutory...
or
a
conflict
between
what
the
collective...
what
the...
the
labor
right
is
and...
and
the
inspector
general's
capacity
to
investigate.
unknown
speaker
right.
let
me
go
back
to
my...
my
question
with
maybe
a
slight
more
exact
question.
is
it
textually
possible
to
come
out
the
way
i
have
just
suggested?
unknown
speaker
what's
the
textual
bar
to
it?
unknown
speaker
no,
it
doesn't.
i
mean,
my
assumption
is...
is
exactly
the
contrary.
my
assumption
is
that
the
inspector
general
is
part
of
the
agency.
administratively
we
know
that's
so.
my...
my
assumption
also
is
that
the
agency
head,
whoever
that
may
be,
cannot
control
the
inspector
general
in...
in
structuring
his
investigation.
i...
i'm
saying
that
the
object
to
be
served
by
an
unfair
labor
practice
determination
is
an
object
to
change
behavior,
and
the
relevant
agency
behavior
here
is
the
behavior
of
the
inspector
general.
unknown
speaker
now,
textually
if
that...
if
you...
if
that
rationale
is...
is
roughly
sound,
is
there
any
textual
basis
that
precludes
our
indicating
that
that
is
the
way
the...
the
two
schemes
ought
to
fit
together?
unknown
speaker
how
does...
how
does
it
do
that?
the
rationale
is
that
the
inspector
general
is
part
of
the
agency,
and...
and
we
know
that
the
statute
constituting
the
inspector
general
so
provides.
unknown
speaker
why?
unknown
speaker
it
might
well.
unknown
speaker
very
well,
mr.
frederick.
mr.
smith,
we'll
hear
from
you.
mr.
smith,
the
government
in
its
brief
in
this
case,
the...
the
part
of
the
government
that
is
petitioning--
[laughter]
--says
that
the
federal
labor
relations
authority
has
greatly
expanded
on
weingarten
rights.
they
are
no
longer
just
the
right
to
have
the
union
be
represented
alone.
they...
they
say...
and
they
cite
cases...
the...
the
right
to
be
informed
in
advance
of
the
general
subject
of
an
examination
so
the
employee
and
union
representative
can
consult
before
questioning
begins,
the
right
to
halt
an
examination
and
step
outside
the
hearing
of
investigators
to
discuss
with
the
union
representative
answers
to
the
investigator's
questions,
the
right
to
negotiate
for
48
hours'
notice
before
an
investigator
can
begin
an
examination.
do
you
agree
that
those
are
correct
descriptions
of
rulings
of
the
flra?
unknown
speaker
but
presumably
you...
if
the
argument
that
you're
making
here,
you
ought
to
get
deference
so
that
if...
if
the
thing
is
debatable
one
way
or
the
other,
your
view
ought
to
prevail.
the
view
of
the
agency
ought
to
prevail.
unknown
speaker
has
the
authority
taken
a
position
in
the
situation
of
an
fbi
investigation
or
a
grand
jury
investigation?
unknown
speaker
does
the
nasa
inspector
general
appoint
to
anyone
other
than
the
head
of
nasa?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
assume...
could
he
go
directly
to
the
fbi
or
does
he
have
to
go
first
to
the
head
of
nasa,
if
he
sees
something
he
thinks
the
fbi
should
know
about?
unknown
speaker
no,
generally.
unknown
speaker
does
the...
does
the
inspector
general
for
nasa
report
to
anybody
in...
in
the
office
of
inspector
general?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
to
the
nasa-oig.
unknown
speaker
was...
was
the
employee
in
this
case
entitled
to
counsel
to
be
present?
unknown
speaker
why?
unknown
speaker
but
was
he
entitled?
was
the
employee
entitled
as
a
matter
of
law
to
have
counsel
present
if...
assume
the
oig
objected.
unknown
speaker
assume
that...
and
why?
is
that
because
of
the
apa,
section
555?
unknown
speaker
well,
because
i
suppose
the
answer
is,
is
that
the
union
rep
has
a
obligation
to...
to
report
to
the
union.
the...
the
oig
could
tell
the
counsel
and
the
employee,
look
it,
this
is
going
to
be
confidential.
if...
if
you
people
do
not
cooperate
with
me,
if
you
do
not
keep
this
confidential,
i'm
going
to
lower
the
boom
on
you.
i'm
going
to
recommend
discipline
and
so
forth
and
so
on.
he
can't
say
that
with
the
union
because
the
union's
obligation
is
to...
to
report
back
to
the
union.
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
that's
troublesome
because
that
seems
to
me
to
compromise
the
union
representative's
function
and
role
vis-a-vis
the
union--
unknown
speaker
--which
is
the
whole
reason
that
he's
there
under...
under
weingarten.
unknown
speaker
mr.
smith,
you
mentioned
nrc,
and
while
you
may
not
agree
with
that
case,
i
take
it
that
judge
kravitch
thought
that
the
eleventh
circuit
decision
was
compatible
with
the
nrc
decision.
unknown
speaker
the
d.c.
circuit
seems
to
think
that
the
nrc
case
was
dispositive
of
this
situation,
and
according
to
the
eleventh
circuit,
it
is
not.
unknown
speaker
mr.
smith,
i'd
like
to
revisit
with
you.
you
said
there
is
a
trend
away
from
or
toward
inspector
generals
investigating
these
types
of
cases.
unknown
speaker
now,
isn't
that
only
a
part
of
the
story?
wasn't
there
a
trend
some
years
ago
away
from
internal
auditors
in
agencies?
unknown
speaker
that's
right.
unknown
speaker
well,
not
all
before
your
time.
for
the
independent
regulatory
agencies,
wasn't
that
during
the
'80's?
unknown
speaker
well,
there's
a
separate
inspector
generals
act
for
the
smaller
agencies.
wasn't
there
then
an
attitude
in
congress
that
the
investigation
should
not
be
controlled
by
the
agency
heads?
unknown
speaker
well,
that
was
the
attitude.
unknown
speaker
the
point
was,
i
don't
think
you
can
have
it
both
ways.
you
can't
say
that
the
inspector
general
is
under
the
agency
head
when
we
know
that
the
purpose
was
to
do
just
the
opposite
and
to
get
the
investigations
from
under
the
agency
heads.
and
let
me
ask
you
this
question.
do
you
agree
that
in
the
old
days
that
the
head
of
the
agency
could
actually
direct
the
auditor's
investigation
of
these
matters?
unknown
speaker
do
you
agree
that
the
head
of
the
agency
cannot
direct
the
investigation
by
the
ig?
unknown
speaker
no,
that's
not
what
i'm
talking
about.
unknown
speaker
no,
that's
not
what
i'm
talking
about.
if
the
ig
said,
i
want
to
investigate
this
matter--
unknown
speaker
--can
the
agency
head
say,
no,
you
can't?
unknown
speaker
if
the
ig
said,
i
want
to
investigate
this
matter
in
this
manner,
can
the
agency
head
say,
you
cannot?
unknown
speaker
the
agency
head
can
tell
them
that?
unknown
speaker
by
what
authority?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
don't
know
where
you
get
that
authority.
i
think
you...
that's...
you
know,
that's...
that's
an
interpretation.
doesn't
the...
doesn't
the
ig...
let's
say
the...
the...
the
ig
and
the
agency
head
were
at
loggerheads
about
a
matter.
to
whom
would
the
ig
then
report
this
dispute?
unknown
speaker
isn't
it
true
that
the
ig
has
a
separate
line
of
communication
and
separate
reporting
authority
to
congress?
unknown
speaker
and
in
reality
they
have
separate
reporting
authority
to
congress.
unknown
speaker
if
they
are
at
loggerheads
with
the
head
of
the
agency.
unknown
speaker
do
you
know
of
any
instance
where
the
agency
head
has
been
directed
by
or
the
ig
has
been
directed
by...
an
ig
has
been
directed
by
an
agency
head
to
conduct
an
audit
or
an
investigation
in
a
certain
way?
unknown
speaker
no.
earlier
you
asked...
you
said
that
the
agency
head
can
direct
an
investigation.
do
you
know
of
any
instance
in
which
that
has
happened?
unknown
speaker
no.
where
an
agency
head
has
said
to
an...
an
ig,
this
is
the
manner
in
which
i
want
you
to
conduct
this
investigation.
unknown
speaker
well,
you
could
be
told...
the
ig
can
be
told
anything.
i...
my
question
is,
can
the
agency
head
direct
the
ig
to
do
what
the
agency
head
wants
the
ig
to
do
or
the
agency
head
believes
to
be
the
law?
unknown
speaker
okay.
now,
do
you
have
any
examples
of
that?
unknown
speaker
but
you
would
have
to
agree...
i
mean,
you
can't
to
a
specific
provision
in
the
ig
act
for
that.
but
if
the
agency
head
agreed
with
you
that
the
union
representative
should
be
in
such
an
interview
and
the
ig
said
no,
you
can't
point
to
any
provision
authorizing
the
agency
head
to
direct
the
ig
to
include
a
union
representative
in
such
a
meeting
or
interview.
unknown
speaker
no,
but
if
your
argument
is,
if...
if
this
were
my
chief
of
staff
who
was
conducting
the...
the
investigation
and
i
said,
look,
you
are
to
include
the
union
representative,
my
chief
of
staff
theoretically
as
the
agency
representative
would
have
to
do
that.
but
i
don't
think
you
can
point
to
any
authority
where
if
the
head
of
the
agency,
the
head
of
nasa,
says,
look,
i'm
sensitive
to
this
problem
and
i
want
the
union
representative
included
in
this
investigation,
and
if
the
ig
says,
buzz
off,
i
don't
know
where
the...
the
head
of
nasa
would
get
the
authority
to
force
that
or...
to
force
that
individual,
the
ig,
to
include
such
an
individual.
unknown
speaker
and
i'd
like
you
to
point
to
me
where
that
authority
is.
unknown
speaker
that's
right.
unknown
speaker
but
your
argument
is
that
this
ig
reports
to
the
administrator,
and
if
the
administrator
can't
direct
the
ig
to
do
precisely
what
you
think
the
ig
should
be
doing,
then
i
don't
know
how
you
can
say
that
the
ig
reports
to
the
administrator.
unknown
speaker
i
bet
you
the
agency
head
does.
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
thank
you,
mr.
smith.
mr.
kirsch,
we'll
hear
from
you.
unknown
speaker
excuse
me.
it
was
my
understanding
that
the
oig
could
not
issue
such
directives
on
his
own,
but
can
only
do
so
with
the
authority
of...
of
the
agency.
isn't
that
right?
i
mean,
he
doesn't
have
delegated
authority
from
the
agency
to
summon
employees.
he
has
to
go
to
the
agency
head
and
say,
i'm
going
to
have
a
hearing,
would
you
make
arrangements
to
have
this
employee
appear.
am
i
wrong
about
that?
unknown
speaker
you
say
here,
mr.
kirsch.
you're
talking
about
the
facts
of
this
particular
case.
unknown
speaker
and
what
did
happen
in
that
respect
here?
unknown
speaker
what
is
it--
--so,
how
did
this
case
ever
get
here
if
that's
what
happened?
answer
justice
breyer's
question.
can
you
give
me
an
example
of...
if
you
start
with
the
proposition
the
head
of
the
agency
can
tell
the
ig
exactly
nothing,
nothing
that
anyone
in
the
audience
couldn't
tell
him,
and
moreover,
he
carries
out
no
authority
of
the
agency.
all
right.
now,
you're
going
to
say
that
statement
is
wrong.
so,
can
you
give
me
the
best
examples
you
can
think
of
of
things
that
the
head
of
the
agency
could
tell
the
person,
not
just
obey
the
law.
any
citizen
can
go
to
the
ig
and
say,
obey
the
law.
i
mean,
is
there
any
authority
at
all
that
the
head
of
the
agency
has
to
tell
the
ig
anything?
unknown
speaker
no,
i'm
not
saying--
unknown
speaker
--does
the...
does
the
head
of
the
agency
have
the
authority
to
do
anything
whatsoever
in
respect
to
the
ig--
unknown
speaker
--that
an
ordinary
citizen
of
the
united
states
wouldn't
have?
unknown
speaker
what?
unknown
speaker
those
are
examples
of
instances
in
which
the
ig
might
have
some
authority
that
he
wouldn't
have
were
he
not
part
of
the
agency.
i
got
that
half.
what
about
the
other
half?
is
there
anything
at
all
that
the
head
of
the
agency
can
tell
the
ig?
unknown
speaker
could
the
agency
head
tell
the
employee
directly,
now,
when
the
ig
calls
you,
you
don't
have
to
go
and
i
won't
give
you
any
discipline
unless
you
have
the
union
rep
there?
you're
entitled
to
the
union
rep.
unknown
speaker
would
that...
that
would
not
be
an
interference
with
the
oig's
authority?
of
course,
it
depends
on
the
answer
in
this
case,
but--
unknown
speaker
--well,
if
that's
so,
then
he
wasn't
entitled
to
counsel
here,
was
he?
unknown
speaker
if
he
was
not
compelled,
he
wasn't
entitled
to
counsel
in
this
case.
unknown
speaker
but
if
he
was
not
compelled,
then
he
was
not
entitled
to
counsel.
unknown
speaker
well,
that
would...
that
would
mean
that
the
evidence
might
not
be
introduced...
introducible
in
a
criminal
trial,
but
that
doesn't
necessarily
mean
that
he
has
a
right
to
counsel.
unknown
speaker
mr.
kirsch,
i...
i
would...
i
had
assumed...
and
please
correct
me
if
i'm
wrong...
that
if
an
employee
is
told
show
up
at
that
interview
or
you
lose
your
job
and
the
employee
then
says,
okay,
can
we
meet
in
my
lawyer's
office,
that
that
employee
is
being
compelled
to
show
up
at
the
interview
even
though
he
says
okay.
but
the
threat
is
you
lose
your
job
and
you're
not
going
to
be
paid.
unknown
speaker
you
say
it's
excluded
under
the
labor
statute.
does
that
mean
that
the
ability
to
bargain
with
management
and
so
forth
is
not
given
in
the...
in
the
case
of
the
fbi?
unknown
speaker
so...
so
that...
you
say
an
fbi
investigation
is
by
definition
not
covered
by
the--
unknown
speaker
--thank
you,
mr.
kirsch.
mr.
frederick,
you
have
2
minutes.
