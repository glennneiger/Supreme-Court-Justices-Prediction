mr.
david
m.
smith
no,
your
honor.
i'm
sorry.
no,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
think
they
would
be
distorted
explanations
of
what
the
authority
has
held
in
a
number
of
cases.
it
is
true,
in
point
of
fact,
that
unions
have
come
forward
and
attempted
to
expand
on
the
basic
weingarten
right
and
to
bargain
for
matters
over
and
above
the
basic
right
to
have
a
union
representative
present
during
an
investigation.
and
it
is
true,
in
some
of
the
examples
you
cite,
the
authority
might
have
held
certain
proposals
to
be
negotiable.
what
they
failed
to
cite
in
their
brief
is
when
the
authority
makes
such
a
ruling,
if
we
are
deemed
to
be
overbroad
in
our
interpretation
of
what
the
right
under
section
7114
(a)(2)(b)
includes,
we're
subjected
to
judicial
review
and
have,
in
some
of
those
cases,
been
corrected
by
the
courts
of
appeal
on
review.
mr.
david
m.
smith
of
course,
we
would
make
that
argument.
and
in
point
of
fact,
i
think
the
authority's
interpretation
of
how
the
statutory
right
in
section
7114
(a)(2)(b)
should
be
interpreted
is
pretty
much
in
line
with
how
the
courts
have
interpreted
the
weingarten
right
in
the
private
sector.
for
instance,
you...
you
advert
to
the
right
to
prior
notice
to
an
interview.
the
d.c.
circuit
ruled
in
the
postal
service
case,
which
is
cited
in
the
brief,
that
this
would
actually
facilitate
the
interview
if
the
union
representative,
where
possible,
knew
in
advance
what
was
going
to
be
discussed
at
the
interview.
then
the
union
representative
would
be
prepared
and
be
able
to...
to
adequately
advise
the
individual
being
subjected
to
the
interrogation
about
what
was
going
on.
so,
this
is
a
private
sector
rule.
i'm
not
aware
that
the
authority
has
specifically
adopted
it.
the
other
rule,
the
right
to
stop
an
interview,
the
authority
has
specifically
gone
the
other
way
and
said
there
is,
in
fact,
no
right
to
cease
and
stop
an
interview.
in
one
case,
we
did
say
that
where
it
would
not
have
interrupted
the
flow
of
the
legitimate
function
of
an
employer
to
do
an
interrogation,
that
that
was
a
permissible...
permissible
thing
to
acquire
an
occasional
break
to
allow
conferences.
but
there's
no
per
se
right
to
break
during
an
investigation.
the
authority
has
embraced
this
court's
rule
that
the
employer
has
the
right,
when...
when
interrogating
an
employee,
to...
to
get
to
the
bottom
of
what's
going
on,
to
hear
the
employer's...
the
employee's
story
and
to
perform
the
interrogation.
the...
the
authority's
rule
in
this
case--
mr.
david
m.
smith
--we
note
in...
in
our...
in
our
brief,
as
counsel
adverted
to,
your
honor,
that
the
fbi
would
not
be
a
representative
of
the
agency
under
our
statute
in
all
likelihood
because
the
fbi
has,
number
one,
concerns
outside
of
the
internal
agency.
if
you
will,
in
this
case,
the
nasa-oig
only
has
concerns
that
relate
to
the...
that
particular
agency.
an
fbi
agent,
on
the
other
hand,
has
concerns
that
relate
outside
of
the
department
of
justice
and
to
any
other
agency.
we
also
note
28
u.s.c.,
the
particular
section
that
says
that
fbi
agents
have
the
ability
to
conduct
interrogations
notwithstanding
any
other
provision
of
law.
i
think
it's
important
to
note
that
the
inspector
general
statute
contains
no
such
language.
so,
when
we
look
at
the
fbi
statute
on
the
one
hand,
which
says,
you've
got
the
right
to...
to
investigate
a
crime
notwithstanding
any
other
provision
of
law,
the
ig
statute
starkly
contains
no
such
provision,
which
led
the
authority
and
the
eleventh
circuit
to
conclude
that
the
inspector
general
must
comply
with,
among
other
laws,
the
labor
statute
when
interrogating
a
bargaining
unit
employee.
justice
ginsburg,
if
i
could
return
to
a
point
that
you
raised.
it
is
in
fact
true
that
the
trend
is
that
investigations
are
being
conducted
more
and
more
by
agency
inspectors
general.
in
the
fourth
circuit's
nrc
case,
which
is
cited
in
our
brief,
the
fourth
circuit
noted
that
all
investigations
within
the
nuclear
regulatory
commission
are
conducted
by
the
office
of
inspector
general.
you
noted
that
the
amicus
nteu
had
filed
a
brief
recognizing
that
under
the
irs
reorganization
act
of
1998,
investigations
previously
performed...
excuse
me...
by
the
office
of
chief
inspector
are
now
being
performed
by
the
department
of
treasury
ig
for
tax
matters.
the...
the
upshot
of
this
is,
employees
who
previously
enjoyed
the
weingarten
right
under
our
statute
are
being
stripped
of
it
because
of
the...
the
growing
trend
of
inspectors
general
doing
interviews.
this
is
very
significant.
there's
no
indication
that
that
was
the
will
or
the
intent
of
congress
when
they...
when
they
passed
any
of
these...
any
of
these
bills
or
that
agencies
should,
by
the
simple
expedient
of
its
assigning
an
investigation
or
requesting
an
investigation
by
the
inspector
general,
to
be
able
to
avoid
section
7114
(a)(2)(b)
of
our
statute.
mr.
david
m.
smith
no.
justice
kennedy,
as
we
read
the
statute,
the
nasa-oig
reports
to
the
administrator
of
nasa.
mr.
david
m.
smith
in
this
case?
mr.
david
m.
smith
generally,
i
think
the
inspector
generals
might
well
receive
tips
or
advice
from
an
external
law
enforcement
agency,
but
they
have
the
right
to
investigate
on
their
own.
they
don't
have
to
be
ordered
to
investigate
by
the
head
of
the
agency.
mr.
david
m.
smith
if
i
understand
your
question,
the...
the
office
of
inspector
general
has
a
number
of
people
that
work
in
it.
this
particular
individual--
mr.
david
m.
smith
--that
did
this
interrogation
was
at
the
marshall
space
flight
center
and
reports
to
the
nasa-oig
in
washington
at
headquarters
nasa.
mr.
david
m.
smith
that's
correct.
so
the...
so
the
line
of
command
is
that
the
oig
personnel
work
oig
personnel.
mr.
david
m.
smith
yes.
mr.
david
m.
smith
the
employee
requested
counsel
and
the
request
to
counsel
was
acceded
to.
mr.
david
m.
smith
as
i
understand
the
oig
position,
they
acknowledge
that
the
right
to
counsel
is
present.
mr.
david
m.
smith
the
eleventh
circuit
found
as
much.
we
think
the
eleventh
circuit
is
correct.
they
quibble
with
this
in
their
reply
brief.
i
don't
know
that
it
matters
so
much
where
the
right
to
counsel
comes
from.
there
seems
to
be
agreement...
and...
and
once
again,
as
i
understand
their
position...
that
there
is,
in
fact,
a
right
to
counsel
at
an
investigative
interview.
now,
this
makes
a
good
point,
if
you
will.
if
the
right
to
counsel
can
be
done
without
affecting
and
harming
the...
the...
the
sanctity
of
the
investigation,
if
the
oig
can
perform
their...
their
important
and
independent
investigative
role
with
a
counsel
present,
it
does
cause
the
question,
as
the
eleventh
circuit
noted,
why
a
union
rep
would
cause
more
of
a
problem
than...
than
the
right
to
counsel.
mr.
david
m.
smith
in
point
of
fact,
the
authority
has
responded
to
that
very
concern,
justice
kennedy,
in
a
recent
decision
of
the
authority,
which
we...
which
we
cite
in
our
brief.
the
authority
has
interposed
no
objection
to
the
bargainability
of
proposals
that
would
place
confidentiality
constraints
on
the
representative
during
an
investigation.
so,
in
fact,
to
the
extent
that
the
sanctity
of
the
investigation
requires
that
confidentiality
attain,
then
the
authority
has
said
this
is
a
permissible
way
to
go.
mr.
david
m.
smith
well--
mr.
david
m.
smith
--no.
the
whole...
i
think
there's
a...
there's
a
two-part
reason
that...
that
a
representative
is...
is
there
during
such
an
interrogation.
in
the
first
place,
the
representative
is
representing
the
employee.
in
the
second
place,
he...
he
or
she
is
representing
the
interests
of
the
bargaining
unit.
it
is
not
fair
to
assume
that
representing
the
interests
of
the
bargaining
unit
requires
that
at
the
conclusion
of
the
interview
the
union
rep
tell
everybody
what
transpired
during
every
aspect
of
a
particular
investigation.
the
interests
of
the
bargaining
unit
are
served
by
the
fact
that
other...
other
employees
know
that
if
i'm
interrogated
by
the
inspector
general,
i'll
have
a
representative
there.
they'll
be
looking
out
for
my
interest.
i'll
have
an
opportunity
to...
to
be
represented,
and
i
won't
get
treated
unfairly
in
such
a
case.
mr.
david
m.
smith
that's
correct.
the
fourth
circuit
held
that
bargaining
on
the
weingarten
right
to
enhance
it
over
and
above
the
basic
representation
right
was
improper,
but
the
fourth
circuit
noted
that
its
position
was
consistent
with
the
third
circuit.
and...
and
i
think
judge
kravitch
in
the
eleventh
circuit
agreed
with
as
much.
if
you're
looking
at
sheer
numbers
now,
the
third
circuit,
the
eleventh
circuit,
and
the
fourth
circuit
have
all
agreed
with
the
authority's
rule
that
an
office
of
inspector
general
investigator
is
a
representative
of
the
agency
when
interviewing
a
bargaining
unit
employee.
if
there
are
no
other
questions--
mr.
david
m.
smith
--the
d.c.
circuit
errs
in
a
number
of
respects,
judge
ginsburg.
in...
in
the
first
place,
the
d.c.
circuit
conflates
a
case
over
negotiability
with
a...
with
a
straight
case
of
the
application
of
the
right
to
have
someone
present
in
the
room,
and
we
think
that's
a
significant
difference.
building
on
the
weingarten
right
is...
is
different
from
the
simple...
simple
application
of
the
weingarten
right.
and...
and
the
d.c.
circuit
is...
is
erroneous
in
that
respect
and
we
think
that's
a
salient
distinction
between
the
d.c.
circuit,
which
is
out
on
its
own
here,
and
all
the
other
courts
of
appeal
which
have
reviewed
and
affirmed
the
authority's
interpretation
in
this
case.
we
think
that
it
is
for
the
authority
to
determine
the
breadth
and
scope
of
the
term
representative
of
the
agency,
and
that
unless
the
authority's
interpretation
is
unreasonable
or
impermissible,
that
interpretation
is
due
to
be
affirmed.
we
submit
to
this
court
that
it
is.
mr.
david
m.
smith
yes,
sir.
mr.
david
m.
smith
prior
to
the
passage
of
the
inspector
general?
mr.
david
m.
smith
it
might
get
before
my
time,
but
i'll
have
to
take
your
word
for
it.
mr.
david
m.
smith
well,
the
inspector
general
act
was
passed
in
1978.
mr.
david
m.
smith
i'm
not
aware
of
that
particular
attitude,
your
honor.
i
can't--
mr.
david
m.
smith
--i
can't
dispute
your
point.
i'll
certainly
accept
it.
mr.
david
m.
smith
yes.
mr.
david
m.
smith
the...
the
legislative
history
says
that
if
an
agency
head
requested
an
inspector
general
to
undertake
an
audit
or
an
investigation--
mr.
david
m.
smith
--it
is
assumed
that
they
would
do
so.
mr.
david
m.
smith
yes.
mr.
david
m.
smith
they
cannot
do
so.
mr.
david
m.
smith
i
think
so.
i
think
the
agency
head--
mr.
david
m.
smith
--yes.
i
think
the
agency
head
can
say
to
the
inspector
general--
mr.
david
m.
smith
--i
think
the
authority
is
you
are
expected
under
the
ig
act
to
comply
with,
quote,
other
statutes
when
you
perform
your
investigative
function.
mr.
david
m.
smith
well,
the
ig
would
have
to
go
to
their
employing
authority
if
they
chose
to
do
so,
which
would
be
either,
depending
on
the
size
of
the
agency,
the
agency
head
or
the
president
of
the
united
states.
mr.
david
m.
smith
right.
they
have...
they
have
the
obligation
under
their
statute
to
file
semiannual
reports
to
the
congress.
mr.
david
m.
smith
yes.
mr.
david
m.
smith
yes.
mr.
david
m.
smith
well,
in
this
case,
the
authority
directed
the
nasa
headquarters
to
inform
the
nasa-oig
to
comply
with
the
7114
(a)(2)(b)
right
in
subsequent
cases.
mr.
david
m.
smith
where
an
agency
head
has
requested
an
inspector
general
to
perform
an
investigation?
mr.
david
m.
smith
we
have
no...
we
have
no
such
case,
but
i
think
it's
fair,
justice
thomas,
to
conclude
that
an
inspector
general
can
be
told
to
comply
with
the
law
when
you
conduct
an
investigation.
the
privacy
act,
for
example.
it's
acknowledged
that
the
privacy
act
must
be
complied
with,
a
host
of
criminal
and
civil
laws.
mr.
david
m.
smith
in
our
view,
the...
the
inspector
general
can
be
told
by
the
agency
head
and/or
the
appointing
authority,
the
president
of
the
united
states,
to
comply
with
the
law,
yes.
mr.
david
m.
smith
the
only
examples
that
we
would
refer
to
would
be
the
ones
i
previously
mentioned,
that
in
the...
in
the
statute,
in
the
legislative
history
it's
conceded,
for
example,
that
the
inspector
general
must
comply
with
the
privacy
act.
if
an
inspector
general,
in
performing
an
investigative
function,
was
refusing
to
comply
with
the
privacy
act,
we
think
it
would
be
appropriate
for
the
agency
head
to
inform
the
ig
to
comply.
failing
the
ig's
compliance,
we
think
the
agency
head,
if
they
appointed
the
ig,
would
remove
him
or
discipline.
if
they
did
not,
they
would
report
this
to
the
president
of
the
united
states.
mr.
david
m.
smith
the
ig's
position
would
have
to
be,
in
such
a
case,
that
the
inclusion
of
a
union
rep
prohibited
or
precluded
me
from
conducting
an
investigation
because
that's
the
statutory
string
that
we
go
through
to
analyze--
mr.
david
m.
smith
--we
think
the
authority--
mr.
david
m.
smith
--well,
the...
the
premise
of
your
question
is
that
it
is
the
agency
head
that
is
imposing
this
requirement
on
the
inspector
general.
mr.
david
m.
smith
we
think
that's
incorrect.
it
is
the
congress
that
imposes
this
requirement
on
the
agency,
any
representative
of
the
agency
conducting
the--
mr.
david
m.
smith
--well,
i
don't
want
to...
i
don't
want
to
butt
heads
with
you.
we
think
inspector
generals
are
not
free
agents
in
conducting
their
investigations--
mr.
david
m.
smith
--in
conducting
their
investigations,
they
have
to
comply
with
the
law.
this
is
but
one
law.
