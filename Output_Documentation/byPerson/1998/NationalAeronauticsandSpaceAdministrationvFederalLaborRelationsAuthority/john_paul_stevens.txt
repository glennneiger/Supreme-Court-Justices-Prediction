justice
john
paul
stevens
in
the
first
of
the
two
cases
we
resolved
the
dispute
between
two
different
executive
agencies
an
arguable
attention
between
two
statutes
that
were
enacted
on
successive
days
in
1978.
the
agencies
are
the
national
aeronautics
and
space
administration
and
the
federal
labor
relations
authority.
on
october
12,
1978
congress
enacted
the
inspector
general
act
which
created
an
office
of
inspector
general
in
each
of
several
federal
agencies
including
nasa.
the
following
day
congress
enacted
the
federal
service
labor-management
relations
statute
which
provides
certain
protections
including
union
representation
for
a
variety
of
federal
employees.
one
of
those
protections
is
the
right
to
have
a
union
representative
present
during
an
interview
which
an
employee
reasonably
believes
may
result
in
disciplinary
action.
the
question
presented
by
this
case
is
whether
an
investigator
employed
in
nasa's
office
of
inspector
general
can
be
considered
a
representative
of
nasa
when
conducting
such
an
interview.
the
answer
is
yes.
like
the
federal
labor
relations
authority,
the
court
of
appeals
concluded
that
the
investigator
in
this
case
was
indeed
acting
as
a
representative
of
nasa
during
the
employee
examination
at
issue.
for
the
reasons
that
are
stated
in
the
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk,
we
affirm.
in
circumstances
such
as
these
an
office
of
inspector
general
investigator
(i
am
avoiding
using
many
of
the
acronyms
that
appear
in
the
opinion
by
the
way)
is
acting
for
and
on
behalf
of
the
agency
in
which
it
is
stationed
and
needs
of
the
relative
independence
granted
such
investigations
by
the
inspector
general
act,
nor
petitioners'
policy
arguments
altre
that
conclusion.
justice
thomas
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
the
chief
justice,
justice
o'connor
and
justice
scalia
have
joined.
