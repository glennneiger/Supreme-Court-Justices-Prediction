justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
interrupt
with
a
question?
how
do
you
know
the
government
could
bring
the
suit?
i
do
not
understand
the
logic
that
would
say
functionally
the
same
suit
would
be
defeated
by
sovereign
immunity
if
the
plaintiffs
are
the...
are
private
parties,
but
if
the
government
sues
in
their
name,
it
would
not
be.
i
don't
understand
that
reasoning.
justice
john
paul
stevens
--but
you
could
not
sue
in
state
court.
you
agree
with
that.
justice
john
paul
stevens
how
is
it
then
they
can
bring
it
in
the
federal
court?
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
there
anything
in
the
history
of
the
convention
that
explains
that?
anything
describing
that
surrender
of
power?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
think
the
convention
is
equally
silent
on
that
point.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
your
point
is
the
structure
of
the
constitution
precludes
congress
from
enacting
a
law
that
would
deprive
the
state
of
sovereign
immunity.
if
that's
true,
how
can
it
deprive
the
state
of
sovereign
immunity
in
the
federal
court
or
the
state
court
when
the
united
states
is
a
plaintiff?
there's
no
lesser
infringement
of
the
right
that
you
say
is
inviolable.
justice
john
paul
stevens
even
though
the
suit
is
filed
on
behalf
of
10
individuals,
it
seeks
precisely
the
same
remedy
and
damages
on
behalf
of
the
individuals
as
if
the
individuals
sued
for
themselves.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
was
acting
as
a
sovereign
when
it
passed
the
statute
authorizing
the
suit
to
be
brought
by
the
individuals.
but
you
say
the
executive
power
is
greater
than
the
legislative
power
to
invade
sovereign
immunity.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
you're
saying
you
did
not
give
up
sovereign
immunity.
justice
john
paul
stevens
except
in
certain
circumstances.
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
concede
that
another
state
could
sue
maine
in
maine's
court
if
maine
objected?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
i
didn't
think
so.
