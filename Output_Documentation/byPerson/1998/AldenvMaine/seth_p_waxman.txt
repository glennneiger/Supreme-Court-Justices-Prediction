mr.
seth
p.
waxman
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
when
the
founders
adopted
the
constitution,
they
conferred
the
article
i
powers
upon
congress
immediately,
but
they
left
it
optional
whether
federal...
lower
federal
courts
would
be...
ever
be
created.
so,
how
did
they
expect
that
the
article
i
powers
would
be
effectuated?
the
answer
is
provided
by
the
text
of
the
supremacy
clause,
which
makes
the
constitution
and
laws
of
the
united
states
the
supreme
law
of
the
land
and
provides
that,
quote,
the
judges
in
every
state
shall
be
bound
thereby,
any
thing
in
the
constitution
or
laws
of
any
state
to
the
contrary
notwithstanding.
in
the
context
of
the
document
as
a
whole,
this
must
include
authority
for
congress
to
provide
remedies
in
state
courts,
otherwise
the
great
article
i
powers
would
have
been
written
in
disappearing
ink.
the
state
relies
in
this
case
on
an
asserted
constitutional
or
pre
constitutional
right
of
sovereign
immunity
in
its
own
courts.
but
as
justice
holmes
explained
for
this
unanimous
court
in
1907,
sovereignty
belongs
to,
quote,
the
authority
that
makes
the
law
upon
which
the
right
depends.
with
respect
to
federal
claims,
the
sovereign
is
not
the
state.
it
is
the
nation,
and
therefore,
as
this
court
explained
in
hilton,
when
a
federal
statute
imposes
liability
upon
the
states,
quote,
the
supremacy
clause
makes
that
law
the
law
in
every
state
enforceable
fully
in
state
court.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
i
would
agree
that
no
case
squarely
decides
it.
i
would
agree
with
the
supreme
court
of
arkansas
in
its
analysis
of
this
very
question
that
this
court's
decisions
in
hilton
and
howlett,
particularly
taken
together,
very
strongly
suggest
the
result.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
no.
howlett
didn't
involve
a
state,
but
it
did...
howlett
stands
for
the
proposition
that
when
the
state,
on
behalf
of
a...
an
arm
of
the
state,
an
entity
that
isn't...
that
is
subject
to
liability
under
the
federal
statute...
we
know
that
states
aren't
subject
to
liability...
are
assertedly
covered
by
a
state
assertion
of
sovereign
immunity...
the
supremacy
clause
requires
that
the
federal
law
be
applied.
in
hilton
i
think--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--well,
it
may
be.
i...
i
would
suggest
that
howlett
itself
announced
two
principles
that
we
think
are
quite
fundamental
to
this
case
and,
understood
in
the
context
of
this
court's
decision
in
hilton,
i
think
strongly
suggest
the
result.
the
principles
are,
number
one,
that
a
state
court
may
not
deny
a
federal
right
absent
a
valid
excuse.
and
number
two,
that
an
excuse
that
is
inconsistent
with
or
violates
federal
law
is
not
a
valid
excuse.
now,
in
hilton,
this
court
considered
the
applicability
of
the
fair
labor
standards
act,
whether
the
fair...
whether
a
claim
could
be
brought
under
the
federal
employers
liability
act
in
state
court,
when
under
welch
the
eleventh
amendment
barred
such
a
suit
in
federal
court.
and
the
state
argued
in
its
brief
and
before
this
court
that
because
the
state
was
entitled
to
a
sovereign
immunity
in
its
own
courts
of
a
constitutional
significance
equal
to
the
eleventh
amendment,
the
unmistakably
clear
principle
of
atascadero
and
welch
had
to
be
applied
and
therefore
the
state
remedy
wasn't
available.
and
this
court
rejected
that
proposition
over
a
strong
dissent
that
adopted
the
state's
argument,
and
the
majority
opinion
held
that,
no,
the
question...
the
clear
statement
requirement
that
has
to
be
applied
in
this
case
is
the...
is
the
requirement
in
pennhurst
and
gregory
v.
ashcroft,
that
is
one
of
pure
statutory
construction.
and
we
don't
have
to
apply
that
pure
statutory
construction
question
in
the
case
because
pardon
establishes
another
rule
of
statutory
construction,
that
is,
stare
decisis,
and
we
therefore
hold
that
that
remedy
is
available.
now,
mr.
chief
justice,
you
are
quite
right
that
this
court's
decision
in
hilton
doesn't
decide
the
precise
question
that's
before
this
court,
but
i
suggest
to
the
court,
most
respectfully,
that
the
discussion
in
hilton
about
the
consequence
of
denying
a
right
in
state
court
against
the...
the
eleventh
amendment
backdrop
in
which
no
right
would
be
available
in
federal
court,
would
be
that
the
plaintiffs
would
be
denied
a
right
at
all,
and
it
would
have
been
i
think...
i
suggest...
rather
surprising
to
the
court
to
understand
that
there
was
some
sovereign
immunity
principle
in
state
court
that
could
trump
that
concern.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
well,
what
i
think...
i
think
it's...
it's
quite
significant,
mr.
chief
justice,
that
the
way
this
court
concluded
its
opinion
in
howlett
was
to
say,
quote,
that
when
a
federal
statute
does
impose
liability
upon
the
states...
i'm
sorry.
hilton...
the
supremacy
clause
makes
that
law
the
law
in
every
state
fully
enforceable
in
state
court,
and
it
cited
as
support
for
that
proposition
the
court's
unanimous
decision
the
term
before
in
howlett.
and
i
suggest
that
that
strongly
implies
that
what
the
court
concluded
was
that
if
the
state
had,
as
it
claimed
it
had,
a
sovereign
immunity
of
constitutional
significance,
this
court
would
have
been
required
under
its
prior
decisions
to
apply
the
constitutional
rule
of...
of
utterly
clear
statement.
i
can't...
unmistakably
clear
statement
as
a
matter
of
constitutional
law,
notwithstanding
pardon.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
well,
i
think
the
answer
to
the
question
of
whether
congress
could
prescribe
any
conceivable
remedy
is
no.
congress
is
limited
in
its
choice
of
remedies,
if
by
nothing
else,
by
this
court's
holding
in
mcculloch
v.
maryland--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--exactly
right.
and
my...
and
what...
one
thing...
a
lot
of
this
court's
decisions,
beginning
with
claflin
in
1876
and
running
all
the
way
down
to
howlett,
establish
and
recognize
the
notion
that
the
federal
courts...
congress,
in
order
to
effectuate
its
remedies,
can't
require,
for
example,
the
states
to
create
courts.
in
claflin,
in...
in
holding
that
the
state
courts
did
have
to
recognize
the
bankruptcy
act
concerns,
it
said
that
the
state
courts
must
hear
the
claims,
quote,
whenever
by
their
own
constitution
they're
competent
to
take
it.
and
in
howlett,
the
court
said
the
requirement
that
a
state
court
of
competent
jurisdiction
treat
federal
law
as
the
law
of
the
land
doesn't
necessarily
include
within
it
the
requirement
that
a
state
create
a
court
of
competent
jurisdiction.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
well,
the
government...
the
government
could
bring
a
suit,
and
we
could
have
a
regime
which
seems
to
me
to
run--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--well,
i
suppose
the
reason
is
that,
you
know,
the
federal
government,
as
the
super
sovereign,
can
abrogate
a
sovereign
immunity--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--in
federal
court.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
but...
excuse
me?
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
i
don't
agree
with
it
because
i
don't
agree
that
the
states
have
a...
with
respect
to
valid
federal
law,
acted
properly
under
congress'
article
i
authority,
i
don't
think
that
the
states
have
a
sovereign
immunity
in
their
own
court...
and
this
goes
to
justice
scalia's
question...
for
two
fundamental
reasons.
this
court
explained
in
nevada
v.
hall,
referring
back
to
kawananakoa
v.
polyblank,
the
proposition
that
there
are...
that
the
notion
of
sovereign
immunity
is
really
an
amalgam
of
two
different
types
of
sovereign
immunity.
this
court
said
in
nevada
v.
hall,
the
doctrine
of
sovereign
immunity
is
an
amalgam
of
two
quite
different
concepts:
one
applicable
to
suits
in
the
sovereign's
own
courts
and
the
other
two
suits
in
the
courts
of
another
sovereign.
the
former
is
absolute.
the
latter
was
always
a
matter
of
comity,
always
until
the
eleventh
amendment
of
the
constitution.
and
the
reason
for
this
is
the
nature
of
sovereignty.
that
is,
sovereignty
is
the
right
to
make
the
substantive
law
upon
which
the
right
depends.
now,
with
respect
to
suits
in
their
own
courts,
which
was
not
the
issue
in
nevada
v.
hall
and
which
is
not
the
issue
in
any
of
this
court's
eleventh
amendment
cases...
those
are
all
suits
about
the
other
kind
of
sovereignty
which
doesn't
depend
on
the
sovereign
being
the
law
giver
and
which
were
always
a
matter
of
comity
until,
in
the
plan
of
convention,
it
was
made
absolute
by
a
constriction
or
an
interpretation
of
the
scope
of
article
iii.
with
respect
to
the
former
type
of
sovereignty,
which
is
at
issue
in
this
case,
there
was
a
principle
in
effect
at
the
time
the
constitution
was
decided
that
states
were
sovereign,
absolutely
sovereign,
against
suits
against
themselves
in
their
own
courts.
and
that
principle
of
sovereign
immunity
has
not
been
affected
by
the
plan
of
convention
or
by
the
enactment
of
the
constitution
at
all.
the
states--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--well,
the--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--justice
scalia,
the
only
statements
of
the
framers
that
i
am
familiar
with
and
the
only
ones
that
are
reported
in
any
of
the
briefs
in
this
case
or
the
law
review
articles
i've
read
were
statements
that
were
made
that
either
made
the
broad
statement
that
the
sovereign
is
always
immune
from
suit
in
his
own
court
and
they
were
all
made
in
the
context
of
the
eleventh...
the
debate
about
the
scope
of
federal
jurisdiction.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
and...
and
we
don't
dispute
that.
in
fact,
i
think
that
principle
exists
to
this
day,
but
the
point
is--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--the
point...
exactly.
the
point
is
that
the
sovereign
was
always
understood...
and
justice
holmes
in
his
opinion
in
polyblank
refers
back
to
the...
to
law
that
predates
the--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--not...
to
the
contrary.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
justice
scalia--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--well,
i...
i
don't
think
that's...
i
don't
think
that
there
is
anything
in
the
constitutional
convention
debates
that
goes
to
the
question
of
suits
against
states
in
their
own
courts
at
all,
let
alone
under
federal
law.
but
we...
what
the
state
is
asking
for
here--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--may
i
provide
a
brief
response?
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
the
answer
to
the
question
could
not
be
clearer
and
it
exists
in
the
supremacy...
the
words
of
the
supremacy
clause
of
the
constitution
which
speak
not
to
federal
judges
or
federal
courts,
but
to
the
judges
of
the
states
which
must
apply
federal
law.
thank
you
very
much.
