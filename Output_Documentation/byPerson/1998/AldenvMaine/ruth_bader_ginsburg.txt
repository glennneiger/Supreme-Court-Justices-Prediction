justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
brann,
how...
how
would
it
work
in
a
case
where
it's
not...
you
brought
up
the
tenth
amendment.
in
a...
it's
a
private,
say,
copyright
or
a
patent
claim.
it's
a
private
suit.
you
wouldn't
get
the
united
states
in
there
like
the
secretary
of
labor
to
enforce
the
fair
labor
standards
act.
so,
with
respect
to
that,
if
the
federal
lawmaker,
copyright
or
trademark,
the
exclusive
lawmaker,
the
state
as
the
alleged
violator,
could
such
a
suit
be
brought
and
by
whom?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
it
wouldn't
be
the
united
states
that's
suing
in
those
cases.
it
would
be
a
private
party
who
says
my
copyright
is
violated
or
my
trademark
is
violated.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
did
i
misunderstand
you
to
say
that
under
your
current
theory,
that
there
would
be
room...
although
there's
no
room
for
this
lawsuit
in
state
court,
there
would
be
room
in
federal
court
for
a
private
party
to
sue
the
state
in
an
area
where
the
federal
court...
where
the
federal
legislature
has
exclusive
legislative
authority?
i
thought
you
told
me
that.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
if
we
could
go
back
to
the...
get
down
from
the
lofty
madisonian
plane
to
the
practical
implications
of
what
you're
saying,
i
think
you
told
me
already
that
a
private
individual
could
not
sue
the
state
for
a
copyright
infringement
or
a
trademark
infringement.
what
happens
to
the
fela
cases,
the
jones
act
cases,
if
we're
dealing
with
a
state
owned
vessel
or
a
state
owned
railroad?
the
workers
can
no
longer
sue
for
themselves.
is
that--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
is
your...
is
that
your
answer
now?
because
you
started
out
to
say,
well,
those
cases
have
to
be
analyzed
on
their
own.
justice
scalia
is
suggesting,
no,
they
don't,
that...
that
it's
always
going
to
be...
have
to
be
a
big
brother
suit,
that
is,
the
united
states
suing
for
the
private
individual.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
let
me...
let
me
home
in
on
money
suits,
not
injunctive
suits.
to
get
money,
the
united
states
can
get
money
for
the
sailors
and
for
the
railroad
workers,
but
the
railroad
workers
cannot
do
it
for
themselves.
