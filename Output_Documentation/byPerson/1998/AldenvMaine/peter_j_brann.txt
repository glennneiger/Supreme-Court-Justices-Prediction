mr.
peter
j.
brann
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
there
is
no
compelling
evidence
that
the
states
surrendered
either
expressly
or
necessarily
their
immunity
from
suit
in
their
own
courts
when,
as
part
of
the
plan
of
the
convention--
mr.
peter
j.
brann
--justice
scalia,
the...
this
court
in
the
blatchford
said...
made
clear
that
it's
incumbent
upon
those
who
are...
who
are
seeking
to
abrogate
the
immunity
that
there
be
compelling
evidence
that
arises
from
the
convention
or
from
the
text
of
the
constitution
that
the
states
gave
up
their
immunity.
and
we
submit
that
they
did
not
do
that.
mr.
peter
j.
brann
the
structure
of
the
constitution--
mr.
peter
j.
brann
--in
which
we
have
enumerated
powers--
mr.
peter
j.
brann
--given
to
the
federal
government--
mr.
peter
j.
brann
--well,
except
that
the
text
of
the
constitution
confirmed
through
the
tenth
amendment...
and
we
think
this
case
is
fundamentally
a
tenth
amendment
case
as
well...
is
that
we
have
a
federal
government
of
limited
enumerated
powers.
and
the
question
is,
was
one
of
those
few
and
defined
powers
the
power
to
abrogate
a
state's
sovereign
immunity
in
its
own
courts.
mr.
peter
j.
brann
we...
that
is
our
position.
it
is...
it
is
our--
mr.
peter
j.
brann
--the...
we
submit
that
one
of
the
things
that
in
the
plan
of
the
convention
that
states
gave
up
was
that...
was
the
ability
of
a
federal...
federal
government
to
enforce
federal
law
in
federal
court,
dating
back
to
the
united
states
v.
texas
case
of
over
100
years
ago,
that
one
of
the
things
that's
necessary
in
order--
mr.
peter
j.
brann
--the
way
in
which
this
court--
mr.
peter
j.
brann
--except
that
the...
this
court
in
united
states
v.
texas
took
the
position...
was
that
the
state
consented
by
virtue
of
the
supremacy
clause
in
granting
the
power...
certain
powers
to
the
federal
government,
that
what
came
with
that
was
the
fact
that
the
federal
government,
not
a
private
individual,
but
a
federal
government
could
enforce
the
federal
statutes.
mr.
peter
j.
brann
we
think--
mr.
peter
j.
brann
--i
do,
justice
scalia.
one
of
the...
we
think
it's
somewhat
difficult
to
answer
that
simply
because
our
experience
is
the
federal
government
always
files
in
federal
court
and
so
it's
never
arisen
in
which...
and
if
they
can
file
it,
presumably
a
state,
if
faced
with
it,
may
or
may
not
even
object
if
they
file
in
state
court.
so,
there's
really...
we
have
very
little
to
go
on
in
that
regard.
but
we
do
agree--
mr.
peter
j.
brann
--justice
ginsburg,
i
think
that
that
actually
illustrates
the
limits
on
which
we
are...
of
our
argument
is
that
in
copyright
and
patent
what
we
have
is
exclusive
jurisdiction
that
is
placed
in
the
federal
courts.
the
state
courts
don't
have
jurisdiction
under
those
statutes,
as
i
understand
it,
and
so
that
under
seminole
tribe,
those
people,
it
was...
it
was
asserted
in...
in
seminole
tribe
were
left
without
a
remedy
which
this
court
did
not
find
was
a
compelling
reason
to--
mr.
peter
j.
brann
--and
in
those
cases,
that
is
true
because
the...
but
that...
the
problem
in
that
case
is
already
posed
as
a
result
of
seminole
tribe
because
of
the
layer
in
which--
mr.
peter
j.
brann
--no,
your
honor.
the
point...
i
was
answering
it
based
on
the
current
statute.
mr.
peter
j.
brann
under
our
constitutional
construct,
that's
entirely
correct,
is
that--
mr.
peter
j.
brann
--if
i
did,
i
misspoke.
the
point
that...
that
we
are
making
is
that
we
look
to
whether
or
not
the...
the...
there
is
power
under
the...
under
the
commerce
clause
to
abrogate
the
sovereign
immunity.
if
that
power
is
not
present,
then...
then
they
cannot
authorize
the
action
either
in
federal
court
or
in
state
court.
but
we
certainly--
mr.
peter
j.
brann
--we
believe
that
under
the
plan
of
the
convention,
what
this
court
referred
to
in...
in
the
united
states
v.
texas
case
as
consent...
one
of
the
things
that
we
consented
to
when
we
ratified
the
constitution
was...
as
general
waxman
alluded
to,
was
a
super
sovereign
and
a
super
sovereign's
ability
to
enforce
its
statutes,
if
they
are
otherwise
valid
and
under
garcia--
mr.
peter
j.
brann
--yes.
this
court
has...
has
held
that
time
and
again.
mr.
peter
j.
brann
as
i
say,
the...
the
question
is
difficult
to
answer
simply
because
it's
never
really
arisen.
the
federal
government
ordinarily
sues
in
federal
court.
mr.
peter
j.
brann
we
think
that
the
states...
one
of
the
key
aspects
of
sovereignty
is
the
ability
to
create
one's
own
courts
and
to
ascribe
them
with
their
jurisdiction.
and
one
of
the
things
that
we
do
know
from
the
framers
was
that
when
we
came
to
the
constitution,
that
the
states
were
immune
since
time
immemorial
in
their
own
courts.
the
suggestion,
therefore,
is
that
although
we
may
very
well
have
given
up
the...
to
the
united
states
the
ability
to
sue
us
in
federal
court
as
part
of
the
plan
of
the
convention,
that
does
not
necessarily
mean
that
we
gave
up
the
right
to
sue
in
state
court.
mr.
peter
j.
brann
because
we
think
that
the--
mr.
peter
j.
brann
--there...
because
of
the
limits
of
federalism
placed
on
congress
in
passing
a
statute--
mr.
peter
j.
brann
--the
limits
are
found
in...
in
the
structure
of
the
constitution
and
that
we
look
to
was...
one
of
the
things
that
the
states
gave
up
when
the
power
to
regulate
commerce
among
the
states...
did
that
also
include
abrogation
of
sovereign
immunity?
mr.
peter
j.
brann
we...
we
would
beg
to
different,
your
honor...
is
that
we
think
that
there
is
a
fundamental
difference
between
when
the
united
states
as
a
sovereign
is
filing
suit
than
when
a
private
individual
is
filing
suit.
mr.
peter
j.
brann
but
in
those
circumstances,
the
united
states
is
still
acting
as
a
sovereign.
it...
it
may
be
trying
to
recover
damages--
mr.
peter
j.
brann
--no,
that's...
that's
not...
that's
not
our
argument.
our
argument
is
that
what
did
we
give
up
when
we
came
to
the
constitution?
and
we
know
from
the
framers
and
from
time
prior
to
that--
mr.
peter
j.
brann
--we
give
up...
we
did
not
give
up
the
right--
mr.
peter
j.
brann
--we
did
give
up
the
right
of
a
private
individual
to
file
a
damages
action
against
the
state.
mr.
peter
j.
brann
if
this...
if
the
law
is
otherwise
valid.
mr.
peter
j.
brann
we
did.
mr.
peter
j.
brann
no.
we
are
not...
we
are
not
challenging
the...
the
ability
of
the
government,
the
united
states,
to
make
substantive
law.
it
is
simply
whether
or
not
one
of
the
powers
that
came
with
it,
as
opposed
to
the
other
remedies
that
are
available,
the...
which
were
alluded
to
this
morning...
you
know,
obviously,
we've
talked
about
the
united
states,
and
there's
also
been
a
reference
to
the
ex
parte
young
actions
and
also
cases
in
which
the
state
is
willing
to
consent.
there
are
other
remedies
available
to
enforce
that--
mr.
peter
j.
brann
--let
me
take
my
best
attempt
to
provide
that
theory...
is
that
we
granted
to
congress
the
power
to
regulate
commerce
among
the
several
states.
and
there's
no
doubt
that
one
of
the
motivating
factors
were
the
tariffs
and
the
trade
wars
and
the
like,
and
we
gave
up
that.
the
states
gave
that
up,
that
you
can
regulate
that
commerce
under
those
circumstances.
we...
then
we
asked
ourselves,
but
did
they
also
give
up
the
right
for
congress
to
pass
a
law
that
then
gave
a
private
individual
the
right
to
bring
a
damages
action?
mr.
peter
j.
brann
but,
your
honor,
i
think--
mr.
peter
j.
brann
--i'm
sorry?
mr.
peter
j.
brann
i
was
about
to
say
that--
[laughter]
--in
a
slightly
different
fashion.
mr.
peter
j.
brann
that
argument,
however,
is
precisely
the
argument
that
i
think
did
not
carry
the
day
in
seminole
tribe
in
the
sense
that
congress'
substantive--
mr.
peter
j.
brann
--the
point
that
i
was
deriving
from
seminole
tribe,
your
honor,
was
the
following,
which
was
that
congress'
substantive
powers
under
the
commerce
clause,
which
certainly
have
expanded,
as
we
look
in
the
late
20th
century--
mr.
peter
j.
brann
--is
not
the
same
as
whether...
as
congress'
power
to
abrogate,
that
they
are
two
separate
issues
and
need
to
be
analyzed
separately.
and
when
we
do
that,
that
takes
us
back
to
the
framers.
and
then
we
think
that
it's
relevant
that
the...
in
the...
if
we
remember
the
madisonian
compromise
in
which
there
were
not
going
to
be
lower
federal
courts
necessarily
created,
we
were
going
to
rely
again
on
state
courts,
the
fact
that
there
is
no
reference
whatsoever
that
in
the
discussions
of
a...
of
the
power
to
abrogate
sovereign
immunity
in
state
court
when
congress
was
acting
under
its
lawful--
mr.
peter
j.
brann
--and
in--
mr.
peter
j.
brann
--no.
mr.
peter
j.
brann
no.
[laughter]
mr.
peter
j.
brann
that
is...
we
agree
entirely
with
the
point
justice--
mr.
peter
j.
brann
--except
that
when
the
debate
over
the...
whether
or
not
article
iii
created
a
forum
in
which
you
could
abrogate
sovereign
immunity...
and
we
have
from
the
statements
quoted
in
the
briefs
from
hamilton
and
the...
and
the
other
framers,
that
it's
inconceivable
that
that
could
happen.
they
started
with
the
premise--
mr.
peter
j.
brann
--and
the...
but
the
debate
over
article
iii
only
becomes
critical
at
the
moment
that...
if
you
start
with
the
premise
that
you
couldn't
file
suit
in
the
state
courts
which,
as
we
recall,
were
going
to
constitute
the
vast
majority
of
the
courts
that
existed...
and
so
the
fact
that
there
is
no
one,
federalist
or
anti
federalist,
as
justice
kennedy
alluded
to,
ever
suggesting
that
one
of
the
consequences
of
a...
of
a...
of
ratifying
the
constitution
is
giving
up
that
sovereign
immunity
in
the
state's
own
courts
we
would
submit
is...
is
fairly
compelling
evidence
if
that...
that
did
not
occur.
mr.
peter
j.
brann
those
cases
would
have
to
be
analyzed
on...
on
their
own
terms.
we
think
that
the...
the
issue
as
to
whether
or
not
congress
has
the
power
under
the
commerce
clause
to
abrogate
such
immunity
is
missing,
and
therefore
to
the
extent
that
they
are
solely
derived
from
there--
mr.
peter
j.
brann
--that
is
certainly--
mr.
peter
j.
brann
--well,
that's
not
our
view.
mr.
peter
j.
brann
we
would
submit
not,
first,
because
it's
important
to
keep
in
mind
that
there
is
also
the
ex
parte
young
injunctive
actions,
and
we
also
have
the
circumstances
where
we
consent.
mr.
peter
j.
brann
if
those
are...
if
those
statutes
are
passed
and
the
sole
source
of
that
is
under
the
commerce
clause,
then
the
answer
to
that
is
yes.
mr.
peter
j.
brann
justice
breyer,
i
think--
mr.
peter
j.
brann
--if
i
follow...
if
i
follow--
mr.
peter
j.
brann
--the
dividing--
mr.
peter
j.
brann
--but
it
wasn't
a
minor
issue
in
the
constitutional
convention.
the
ability
of
a
private
individual
to
bring
a
damages
action
against
a
state
was
very
much
on
the
minds
of
those
who
wrote
the
constitution.
mr.
peter
j.
brann
correct.
and
the...
and
there's...
and
there
are--
mr.
peter
j.
brann
--certainly.
mr.
peter
j.
brann
and
indeed--
mr.
peter
j.
brann
--we
waive
it
in
numerous
circumstances
as
well.
mr.
peter
j.
brann
but
there
are
other
factors
that
can
be
brought
to
bear
in
the...
in
those
circumstances
in
that...
in
that
you
have,
in
addition
to...
in
dealing
with
the
federal
government,
there
are
obviously
various
political
aspects
of
it
as
well.
and
in
terms
of
how
it
can
be
enforced
and
the
mechanisms,
it
can
be
done
in
a
number
of
different
ways,
as
you...
as
you
mentioned,
justice
breyer,
incentives
and
the
like.
there
are
other...
there
are
other
ways
in
which
we
can
approach
this
problem,
but
the
one
way
which
we
can't
do
it
is
to
do
it
in
a
way
that
would
violate
what
was
the
original
bargain,
if
you
will,
when
the
states
went
into
the...
into
the
constitution,
which
was
that
we
were...
although
we
were
giving
up
our
rights,
if
you
will,
and
our
sovereignty
to
some
degree
with
regard
to
the
federal
government
passing
federal
statutes,
which
are
otherwise
valid,
that
did
not
carry
with
it
necessarily...
and
indeed,
it
did
not.
there's
no
one
who
suggested
it
carried
with
it
the
ability
to
abrogate
sovereign
immunity
certainly
in
a
state's
own
court.
mr.
peter
j.
brann
and
that
is
true.
but
we
think
it's
important
to
remember,
is
that
in
a...
in
a
system
of
few
and
enumerated
powers,
the
question
is,
did
the
power
to
regulate
commerce
among
the
states
also
include
this
abrogation?
mr.
peter
j.
brann
we
think--
mr.
peter
j.
brann
--but,
justice
souter,
i
think,
though,
taken...
and
we
agree
with
the...
the
precise
example
that
you're
using,
the
revolutionary
war
debts...
is
that
there
was
no
one
who
suggested
that
congress
could
pass
a
statute
that
would
then
make
it
possible
to
collect
those
debts
which
were
very...
the
fact
that...
and
the
fact
that
no
one
every
suggested
that--
mr.
peter
j.
brann
--i'm
sorry.
mr.
peter
j.
brann
no.
i
mean,
hans...
you
know,
it
has
a
much
broader
scope.
mr.
peter
j.
brann
well,
we
don't
think
that
we're
having
to
have
it
both
ways.
what
we
think
is
that
we...
we
have
agreed
by
ratifying
the
constitution
that
the
super
sovereign,
the
united
states,
can
file
suits
to
enforce
action--
mr.
peter
j.
brann
--i
think
it's
significant
that
no
one
suggested
that
they
could
pass
such
a
law
is
the--
mr.
peter
j.
brann
--well,
but
that...
or
that
no
one
suggested
that
one
of
the
things
that
congress
could
do,
in
order
to
address
this
issue
of
the
revolutionary
war
debts,
was
pass
a
law
that
would
then
be
enforceable.
mr.
peter
j.
brann
it
may
very
well
be.
because
it's
inconceivable
to
the
framers
that
a
state
could
be
sued
without
its
consent,
we
don't
find
it...
which
this
court
has
noted
in...
in
not
only
the
tenth
amendment
but
also
in
the
eleventh
amendment
context.
it
is
not
surprising
that
this
debate
did
not
occur
at
the
time
of
the
convention.
but--
mr.
peter
j.
brann
--no.
all
of
the
evidence
runs
to
the
following,
which
is
that
as
the
framers
state
in
numerous
circumstances,
that
it's
inherent
in
the
nature
of
sovereignty
not
to
be
amenable
to
suit.
now,
they
were...
and
they
were
obviously
premised
based
on
the...
on
the
historical
existence
of
the
states'
courts,
and
they...
and
they
were
looking
to
if
you
can't
be
sued
in
state
court...
i
mean...
then
when
we
create
the
federal
courts,
the
article
iii
courts,
does
that
change
the
calculus?
mr.
peter
j.
brann
because
the...
the
immunity
of
a
state
from
suit
without
its
consent
from
a
private
individual
was
a
bedrock
principle
that
the
framers
took
to
the
convention.
and--
mr.
peter
j.
brann
--i
see
that
my
time
is
expired.
mr.
peter
j.
brann
i
think
so.
