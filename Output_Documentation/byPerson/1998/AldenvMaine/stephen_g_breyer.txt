justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so,
imagine
if
you
were
rufus
king
or
charles
pinckney
or
someone
who...
i
think
one
represented
maine.
they
were
at
the
constitutional
convention.
you'd
never
have
dreamt
that
the
fair
labor
standards
would
have
applied
to...
to
state
government,
but
that's
what
happened.
now,
my
question
is
why
would
sovereign
immunity
be
so
important
to
you
that
of
all
important
things
in
the
constitution
to
you,
whether
massachusetts'
constitution
gives
more
protection
to
human
liberty
than
the
10
amendments...
if
it
does,
by
the
way,
congress
can
abrogate
that,
can't
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
i
mean,
congress
can...
we're
assuming
congress
could
abrogate,
say,
any
extra
protection
that...
that
was
important
to
massachusetts,
so
it
wrote
it
into
its
constitution.
congress
could
abrogate
that
if
it
goes
beyond
the
federal
constitution,
otherwise
legitimate
exercise,
couldn't
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
mean,
an
otherwise...
all
right.
so,
i'm
just...
i'm
just
trying
to
point
out
there
were
a
lot
of
things
that
are
important,
that
under
article
i
congress
could
abrogate
a
lot
of
things.
now,
i
say
i'm
going
to
make
you,
rufus
king,
foresee
everything.
all
right?
now,
i
just
wonder
why...
what
would
be
more
important
to
you.
you
foresee
this
future.
you
say
is
sovereign
immunity
so
important
to
you
that
i'm
going
to
insist,
say,
in
an
environmental
area,
that
congress
set
up
a
federal
bureaucracy
to
tell
the
states
everything
about
what
to
do,
than
let's
say
to
devise
some
incentive
type
system
that
depends
upon
private
citizens
bringing
sludge
control
suits
in
state
courts.
in
other
words,
why
is
it
more
important
to
you
in
your...
in
your
federalist
philosophy,
that
in
the
future
the
right
way
to
do
it
is
to
set
up
federal
bureaucracies,
but
the
wrong
way
to
do
it
is
to
have
individual
citizens
sue,
say,
incentive
based
suits
in
state
courts?
you
see,
i'm
saying--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--i'm
going
on
the
idea
of
the
lesser
includes
the
greater.
why
do
you
want
big
brother,
the
federal
government,
breathing
down
your
neck?
why...
why,
if
you
are
the
most
extreme
federalist
at
that
constitutional
convention,
are
you
going
to
insist
upon
the
principle
of
sovereign
immunity
trumping
everything
on
this,
what
seems
a
minor
issue
of
bringing
suits
in
state
court?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
i
mean--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--let
me
be
straightforward
about
what's
bothering
me.
it
seems
that
if
you
prevail,
we're
going
to
get
some
kind
of
hodgepodge,
that
there
will
be
lots
of
federal
statutes
that
there's
no
problem
with
enforcing,
and
then
there
will
be
some
that
there
is
a
problem
with
enforcing.
and
there
will
be
no
rhyme
nor
reason
to
that.
rather,
in
many
instances,
it
will
lead
to
more
federal
intervention
as
they
build
federal
bureaucracies;
in
some,
it
won't.
so,
what
i
don't
see
is,
is
it
clear
in
the
framework
of
the
convention
that
the
founders
would
have
wanted
that
odd
hodgepodge
of
enforceability?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
where
did
they
think...
where
did
they
think...
to
start...
to
end
with
the
beginning
question,
where
did
the
people
at
that
time
think
that
if
congress
were
to
pass
a
legitimate
law
that
bound
a
state
government
to
pay
some
money
to
some
people...
where
would
have
a
law
like
that
have
been
enforced?
there
were
no
federal
courts.
did
they
just
think
you
couldn't
enforce
it
or
that
there
couldn't
be
such
a
law?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you're
saying
they
couldn't
pass
the
law.
so--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--but
if
they
thought
they
could
pass
the
law,
they
would
have
said
you
can't
enforce
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so,
there
is
no
evidence
in
the
debate
or
is
there?
or
what
would
happen?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so,
if
there
is
no
evidence
at
all
about
what
the
framers
thought
would
happen
to
enforce
a
law
that
congress
passed
to
bind
the
states,
how
could
we
know
now
that
given
the
later...
the
greater,
they
wouldn't
have
conceded
the
lesser?
