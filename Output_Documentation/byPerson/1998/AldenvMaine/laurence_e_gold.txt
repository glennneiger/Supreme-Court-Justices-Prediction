mr.
laurence
e.
gold
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
question
in
this
case,
which
we
have
referred
to
in
our
briefs
as
the
article
i
state
sovereign
immunity
question,
is
generated
by
and
can
only
be
answered
by
reference
to
the
unique
sovereignty
scheme
of
our
constitution.
that
scheme
divides
sovereignty
between
the
united
states
and
the
states,
subdivides
the
sovereign
authority
of
the
united
states
among
the
three
branches
of
the
national
government,
makes
the
sovereign
legislative
authority
of
the
united
states
within
its
sphere
supreme,
and
provides
a
dual
role
for
the
state
courts
in
the
enforcement
of
the
entire
law,
both
federal
and
state.
the
question
here
is
predicated
on
the
following
case.
after
their
federal
court
fair
labor
standards
act
overtime
pay
case
was
dismissed
on
eleventh
amendment
grounds
and
as
specifically
provided
for
in
the
flsa,
the
state
employee
plaintiffs
here
began
this
proceeding
by
bringing
an
flsa
case
against
the
state
of
maine
in
the
superior
court
of
cumberland
county,
maine.
maine
in
its
answer
answered
entered
an
affirmative
defense
of
sovereign
immunity.
the
superior
court
granted
maine's
motion
for
judgment
on
that
defense,
and
the
supreme
judicial
court
of
maine
in
a
4
to
2
decision
affirmed.
in
this
court,
maine's
submission
in
defending
the
decision
below
is
that
the
flsa
provision
for
state
employee
overtime
pay
suits
against
a
state
in
state
court
is
not
a
valid
law
because
it
transgresses
a
constitutional
constraint
on
congress'
article
i
legislative
power,
one
that
puts
it
beyond
congress'
authority
to
provide
for
the
enforcement
of
a
valid
federal
statute
through
state
liability
rules
that
override
state
sovereign
immunity
rules.
the
framework
for
the
issue
presented
is
provided
by
this
court's
garcia
decision
and
its
decision
in
howlett
v.
rose.
as
to
garcia--
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
--no.
it
was
a
suit
against
a
municipality,
and
all
we
argue
is
that
its
method
of
approach
frames
the
question.
then
the
ultimate
question
becomes
the
one
that
the
state
raises
whether
a
suit
against
a
state
where
the
state
claims
sovereign
immunity
is
in
a
different
category
or
class
than
a
suit
against
a
municipality
where
the
municipality
claims
state
sovereign
immunity.
and
that
question
turns
on...
not
on
the
analytic
structure
of
howlett,
which
would
treat
both
the
same,
but
as
the
state
recognizes,
on
whether
state
sovereign
immunity,
when
claimed
by
the
state,
is
of
a
different
and
constitutional
dimension,
a
dimension
which
would
make
the
federal
law
invalid
and
thereby--
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
--there...
if
congress
cannot
provide
for
private
party
state
court
enforcement
of
this
law,
given
the
court's
eleventh
amendment
jurisprudence
which
also
closes
the
federal
courts
to
such
proceedings--
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
--that
could
be
done,
but
it
would
not
be
a
suit
for
back
pay
for
the
money
due
and
owing,
and
therefore
what
you
have
is
if
state
sovereign
immunity
is
an
absolute
check
on
the
sovereign
powers
of
congress,
then
there
can
be
no
private
party
enforcement
of
a
valid,
binding
federal
enactment.
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
yes,
and
the...
the
state
does
concede
that,
and
indeed
as
this
court
has
made
clear,
so
that
we're
not
overstating
anything,
the
suit
by
the
united
states
could
be
in
federal
court
as
well
as
in
state
court.
there
is
no
bar
to
that.
but
the
question
is
whether
congress
is
constrained
by
some
constitutional
principle
from
providing
that
which
the
sovereign
can
normally
provide
for
enforcement
through
the
usual
processes
of
the
law
by
the
right
holder
in
the
law
created
by
the
sovereign.
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
well,
if...
if
i
can,
justice
kennedy,
it
seems
to
me
that
what
we
see
with
regard
to
the
original
understanding
is
two
points,
and
i
don't
think
they
lead
to
the
conclusion
that
there
is
some
implicit
constitutional
limit
on
congress'
sovereign
authority
that
runs
in
favor...
that
limits
congress
in
its
sovereign
power
and
runs
in
favor
of
the
states
as
to
a
matter
where
the
state
isn't
sovereign.
i
don't
want
to
engage
in
word
play,
but
what
the
claim
is
here,
that
there
is
something
never
seen
before,
namely,
a
limit
on
a
true
sovereign
in
favor
of
a...
an
entity
who
is
certainly
a
governing
authority
and
an
important
governing
authority
and
a
sovereign
in
many
regards,
but
runs
in
favor
of
that
governing
entity
in
an
aspect
of
the
overall
scheme
in
which
the
state
or
that
governing
entity
is
not
sovereign.
that
is
a
wholly
extraordinary
notion,
one
which
we
would
think
had
to
have
some
express
understanding,
and
it's
quite
different
from
the
concerns
and
interests
that
animated
what
we
know
of
the
fidelity
to
state
sovereign
immunity.
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
right,
but...
and
as
the
eleventh
amendment
shows,
in
making
adjustments
to
deal
with
the
new
aspects
of
that
extraordinary
situation,
there
was
what
i
think
would
have
to
be
seen
as
an
entirely
new
concept
adjusted
to
the
situation
to
preserve
a
form
of...
or
to
create
a
form
of
state
sovereign
immunity
which
would
not
have
obtained
by
simple
extrapolation
from
the
law
of
nations.
and
that's
the
eleventh
amendment.
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
and--
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
--well,
as
time
evolves
and
we
understand
more
about
what's
needed,
i
would
argue
to
you
that
that
kind
of
judgment
is
precisely
the
kind
of
judgment
that
congress
makes,
what
is
proper
enforcement,
unless
there
is--
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
--well,
no.
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
but
a
sovereign
immunity
concept
which
goes
beyond
any
concept
that
was
understood
at
the
time...
after
all,
sovereign
immunity
as
an
attribute
of
sovereignty
is
vouchsafe
to
the
states
in
state
court.
any
claim
on
state
law
can
be
met
with
sovereign
immunity.
but
here
we're
dealing
with
a
situation
where
congress
is
the
sovereign,
where
the
state's
sovereignty
is
diminished
by
the
constitution.
the
state
is
bound
by
a
federal
law
in
a
way
which
a
sovereign...
a
total
sovereign
could
not
be,
and
there
is
no
indication
that
there
was
anything
in
history
to...
to
show
that
an
entity
in
that
situation
had
sovereign
immunity,
and
the
true
sovereign--
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
--no.
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
no.
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
the...
first
of
all,
for
sovereign
immunity,
it
has
to
be
a
suit
against
the
state
on
a
federal
law
which
is
valid
within
the
state
sovereignty
constraints
on
federal
law,
and
nothing
we
say
here
goes
to
the
special
case
of
the
eleventh
amendment,
which
is,
as
this
court
has
been
careful
to
state,
a
restriction
on
the
federal
judicial
power
borne
of
particular
concerns
about
the
federal
judicial
power,
not
a
constraint
on
the
sovereign
legislative
power.
in
seminole...
if
i
could,
and
then
i
will
try
to
save
the
rest
of
my
time...
the
court
did
not
say
that
eleventh
amendment
sovereign
immunity
is
a
limit
on
congress'
plenary
law
enforcement
powers.
what
is
said
in
a
very
careful
holding
was
that
state
sovereign
immunity,
as
a
limit
on
the
federal
judicial
power,
that
separation
of
powers
concepts
prevent
the
legislative
branch
from
expanding
the
heads
of
federal
jurisdiction.
and
therefore,
congress
cannot
provide
for
suits
in
federal
court
that
are
beyond
the
federal
judicial
power.
this
is
a
very
different
situation
and
it's
limited
to
the
enforcement
of
federal
laws
properly
binding
on
the
states
and
enacted
by
congress
as
the
sovereign
within
its
proper
sphere.
and
that
is
not
a
wide
open
area.
it
is
an
area
carefully
confined
by
the
basic
concepts
of
the
legislative
power.
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
two
points,
if
i
can.
first
of
all,
the
state
continues
to
talk
about
giving
up
its
sovereign
immunity
and
what
it
agreed
to.
the
sovereign
immunity
the
state
had
was
premised
on
some
legal
understanding.
it
was
sovereign
immunity
in
its
own
courts
on
rights
under
its
own
law.
we
have
created
a
new
situation
in
the
constitution
in
which
the
state
courts
have
a
dual
function,
one
which
is
different
from
the
one
it
had
before
and
where
the
state
courts
are
dealing
with
laws
of
another
sovereign
which
are
binding
without
regard
to
the
interests
or
desires
of
a
state
and
where--
