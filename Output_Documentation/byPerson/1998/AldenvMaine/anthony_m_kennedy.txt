justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
it
is
a
constitutional
principle.
mr.
gold,
one...
i
just
can't
conceive
of
the
constitution
being
ratified
if
it
were
thought
that
the
states
could
be
sued
as
states
in
their
own
courts,
and
to
that
extent,
i
understand
the
eleventh
amendment
as
being
confirmatory
of
the
original
understanding.
of
course,
it's
an
amendment,
and
we
know
that
amendments
are
done
to
change
the
original
understanding.
but
in
this
case
i
think
it
was
the
original
understanding
and
that's
what
puzzles
me
in
this
case.
and
of
course,
we
know
the
thirteenth,
fourteenth,
and
fifteenth
amendment
made
a
dividing
line
and
federalism
for
those
actions
were
changed.
but
this
isn't
under
the
thirteenth
and
fourteenth
amendment,
and
it
comes
back
to
this
basic
constitutional
principle
which
i
think
teaches
something,
maybe
not
very
much
if
the
federal
government
can,
in
effect,
get
around
our
opinion
by
withholding
grants
in
aid
or
suing
on
its
own.
but
it
seems...
i
have...
i
have
trouble
conceiving
of
the
constitution
being
ratified
under
your
theory.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i...
i
think
we...
we
can
take
for
purposes
of
argument
here
there's
little
doubt
that
congress
can
pass
this...
this
statute.
but
simply
because
the
congress
has
the
sovereignty
to
legislate,
does
it
follow
that
it
can
prescribe
any
conceivable
remedy?
in
this
case,
the
government
could
sue.
why
didn't
the
government
bring
a
suit
in
this
case?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
and
it's
limited
by
cases
such
as
new
york
in
which
we
say
you
can't
command
the
state
to
do
something
directly.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
if
this...
if
this
cause
of
action
is...
is
so
important
that
we
must
set
aside
the
state's
immunity
in
its
own
court,
why
isn't
it
important
enough
that
the
government
itself
could
have
brought
the
suit?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
you
can
sue
in
your
own
court.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but...
but
that's
the
point.
it's
the
dog
that
doesn't
bark
argument.
and
the
anti
federalists
didn't
bring
this
up
either.
if
the
constitution
had
contemplated
it,
certainly
the
anti
federalists
would
have
made
the
statement.
i
see
your
red
light
is
on.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--but
you
don't
rely
on
the
text
of
the
constitution
at
all,
do
you?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
the
structure
is
what
your
entire
argument
is.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
understand.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
you
don't
have
anything
in
the
text
is
what
i'm
saying.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
now,
do
i
understand
correctly
that
you
would
agree
that
the
united
states
could
not
bring
this
action
on
behalf
of
these
employees
in
the
state
court?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
then
the
federal
courts--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
and
insofar
as
there
is
a
perceived
incongruity
in
your
concession
that
the
united
states
can
sue,
really
the
constitution
is
quite
specific
that
one
state
can
sue
another
state,
and
so
it
surely
follows
that
the
united
states
can
sue
a
state.
so,
i
see
no
inconsistency
there
at
all.
and
i
thought
that
should
have
been
part
of
your
submission
and
your
answer
to
justice
souter.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but...
but
it's
very
clear
that
they
could
sue
in
federal
courts.
it's
in
article
iii.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
the
petitioners
are
a
group
of
probation
officers.
they
filed
an
action
against
their
employer
which
was
the
state
of
maine.they
filed
in
state
court
seeking
relief
under
a
federal
statute.
they
sought
damages
for
alleged
violations
of
the
fair
labor
standards
act.
the
state
trial
court
dismissed
the
suit
on
the
basis
of
the
state
of
maine
sovereign
immunity,
and
the
maine
supreme
judicial
court
affirmed.
we
also
affirm.
we
hold
that
the
powers
delegated
to
congress
under
article
i
of
the
united
states
constitution
do
not
include
the
power
to
subject
nonconsenting
states
to
private
suits
for
damages
in
state
courts,
and
the
state
of
maine
has
not
consented
to
this
suit.
because
the
eleventh
amendment
makes
explicit
reference
to
the
state's
immunity
to
private
suits,
we
sometimes
refer
to
the
state
sovereign
immunity
as
"eleventh
amendment
immunity".
the
phrase
is
a
convenient
shorthand,
but
really
something
of
a
misnomer,
for
state
sovereign
immunity
neither
derives
from
nor
is
limited
by
the
terms
of
the
eleventh
amendment.
rather
the
constitution
structure
and
its
history
and
the
authoritative
interpretations
by
this
court
make
clear
that
the
state's
immunity
from
suit
is
a
fundamental
aspect
of
the
sovereignty
which
the
states
enjoyed
before
ratification
of
the
constitution,
and
which
they
retain
today,
except
as
altered
by
the
plan
of
the
convention
or
certain
constitutional
amendments.
the
generation
that
designed
and
adopted
our
constitutional
system
of
federalism
considered
immunity
from
private
suits
central
to
sovereign
dignity.
the
leading
advocates
of
the
constitution
including
alexander
hamilton,
james
madison
and
john
marshall,
assured
the
people
in
no
uncertain
terms
that
the
constitution
would
not
strip
the
states
of
sovereign
immunity.
the
state
conventions
which
addressed
the
issue
in
their
formal
ratification
documents
agreed.
when
the
supreme
court
held
in
chisholm
versus
georgia
that
a
non-consenting
state
could
be
sued
by
a
private
individual
in
federal
court,
the
decision
was
promptly
and
all
but
unanimously
overruled
by
the
eleventh
amendment.
the
court
has
been
consistent
in
interpreting
the
adoption
of
the
eleventh
amendment
as
conclusive
evidence
that
the
decision
in
chisholm
was
contrary
to
the
well
understood
meaning
of
the
constitution.
that
last
was
a
quotation
from
my
recent
case
in
seminole
tribe.
in
hans
versus
louisiana,
decided
in
1890,
the
court
held
that
sovereign
immunity
barred
a
citizen
from
suing
his
own
state
under
the
federal
question
head
of
jurisdiction.
the
court
was
unmoved
by
the
petitioner's
argument
of
the
eleventh
amendment
by
its
terms
applied
only
to
suits
brought
by
citizens
of
other
states.
latest
decisions
rejected
similar
request
to
conform
the
principle
of
sovereign
immunity
to
the
strict
language
of
the
eleventh
amendment,
and
the
opinion
recites
this
line
of
precedence
in
which
we
hold
that
non-consenting
states
are
immune
from
suits
bought
by
federal
corporations
foreign
nations,
indian
tribes
and
suits
in
admiralty
case.
these
holdings
reflect
a
settled
doctrinal
understanding,
consistent
with
the
views
of
the
leading
advocates
of
the
constitution's
ratification,
that
sovereign
immunity
derives
not
from
the
eleventh
amendment
but
from
the
structure
of
the
original
constitution
itself.
whether
the
constitutional
plan
grants
congress
authority
under
article
i
to
abrogate
a
state
sovereign
immunity
in
its
own
courts
is
a
question
of
first
impression.
we
look
first
at
the
evidence
of
the
original
understanding
of
the
constitution.
the
petitioners
contend
that
because
the
debates
on
the
ratification
of
the
constitution
and
the
events
surrounding
the
adoption
of
the
eleventh
amendment
focused
on
the
states
immunity
from
suit
in
federal
courts.
the
historical
record
gives
no
instruction
as
to
the
founding
generation's
intent
to
preserve
the
states
immunity
from
suit
in
their
own
courts.
we
believe
however
that
the
founder's
silence
is
best
explained
by
the
simple
fact
that
no
one,
not
even
the
constitution's
most
ardent
opponents,
suggested
that
the
document
might
strip
the
states
of
the
immunity.
the
concern's
voice
of
the
ratifying
conventions
about
state
sovereign
immunity,
and
the
furor
raised
by
chisholm
and
the
speed
and
unanimity
with
which
the
eleventh
amendment
was
adopted
underscore
the
jealous
care
with
which
the
founding
generation
sought
to
preserve
the
sovereign
immunity
of
the
states.
in
light
of
the
historical
record
it
is
difficult
to
conceive
that
the
constitution
would
have
been
adopted.
if
it
had
been
understood
strip
states
of
immunity
from
suing
their
own
courts
and
cede
that
the
federal
government
a
power
to
subject
non-consenting
states
to
private
suits
there.
this
case
at
one
level
concerns
the
formal
structure
of
federalism,
but
in
a
constitution
as
resilient
as
ours
form
mirror
substance.
congress
has
vast
power,
but
not
all
power.
when
congress
legislates
in
matters
affecting
the
states,
it
may
not
treat
these
sovereign
entities
as
mere
prefectures
or
corporations,
congress
must
accord
states
the
esteem
due
to
them
as
joint
participants
in
a
federal
system.
one
beginning
with
the
premise
of
sovereignty
in
both
the
central
government
and
the
separate
states.
congress
has
ample
means
to
ensure
compliance
with
valid
federal
laws
but
it
must
respect
the
sovereignty
of
the
states.
in
an
apparent
attempt
to
disparage
a
conclusion
with
which
it
disagrees,
the
dissent
in
this
case
attributes
our
reasoning
to
natural
law.
we
seek
to
discover
however
only
what
the
framers
and
those
who
ratified
the
constitution
sought
to
accomplish
when
they
created
the
federal
system.
we
appeal
to
no
higher
authority
than
the
charter
which
they
wrote
and
adopted.
theirs,
the
founders,
was
the
unique
insight
that
freedom
is
enhanced
by
the
creation
of
two
governments,
not
one.
we
need
not
attach
a
label
to
our
dissenting
colleague's
insistence
that
the
constitutional
structure
adopted
by
the
founders
must
yield
to
the
politics
of
the
moment.
although,
the
constitution
begins
with
the
principle
"that
sovereignty
rest
with
the
people",
it
does
not
follow,
that
the
national
government
becomes
the
ultimate
preferred
mechanism
for
expressing
the
people's
will.
the
states
exist
as
a
refutation
of
that
concept.
in
choosing
to
ordain
and
establish
the
constitution
the
people
insisted
upon
a
federal
structure
for
the
very
purpose
of
rejecting
the
idea
that
the
will
of
the
people
in
all
instances
as
expressed
by
the
central
power,
the
one
most
remote
from
their
control.
the
framers
of
the
constitution
did
not
share
our
dissenting
colleague's
belief,
the
congress
may
circumvent
the
federal
design
by
regulating
the
states
directly
when
it
pleases
to
do
so,
including
by
a
proxy
in
which
individual
citizens
are
authorized
to
levy
upon
the
state
treasuries
absent
the
state's
consent
to
jurisdiction.
for
these
reasons
we
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
supreme
judicial
court
of
maine.
justice
souter
has
filed
a
dissent
in
which
justices
stevens,
ginsburg
and
breyer
have
joined.
