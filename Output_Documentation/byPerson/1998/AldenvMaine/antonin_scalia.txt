justice
antonin
scalia
--so
that
the
private
party
can
prevent
any
future
violation
of
the
federal
law,
and
i
assume
the
united
states,
if
it...
if
it
wished,
if
the
statute
were
framed
that
way,
could
sue
on
behalf
of
the
people
who
had
been
deprived
previously
of
what
they
were
entitled
to
under
the
federal
law.
justice
antonin
scalia
but,
you
know,
you
say
it's
an
extraordinary
notion,
but
the
whole...
the
whole
system
of...
of
dual
sovereignty
and
dual
citizenship
was
an
extraordinary
notion.
i
mean,
it
is
extraordinary.
justice
antonin
scalia
that...
that...
well,
but--
justice
antonin
scalia
--as
justice
kennedy
pointed
out,
the
eleventh
amendment...
our
case
law
has
said...
and
i
understand
there's
some
argument
about
it,
but...
but
it's...
it's
the
law
here
that
it's
just
confirmatory
of...
of
sovereign
immunity
that
existed.
and
the
argument
you're
making
now
would
make
a
lot
of
sense
if
you
were
saying,
you
know,
really
the
federal
government
has
its
hands...
hands
tied
unless
this
aspect
of
state
sovereign
immunity
were
automatically
eliminated
by
the
constitution.
and
in
fact,
it
hasn't
had
its
hands
tied.
it
can...
it
can
achieve
its
ends
in...
in
various
other
ways,
and
i
think
it's
significant
that,
you
know,
it's
been
200
and...
and
what...
some
odd
years
before...
before
this
issue
has
even
come
before
us.
apparently
the
federal
government
hasn't
found
it
very
needful
to
proceed
in
this
fashion
in
order
to
achieve
its...
its
necessary
objectives.
justice
antonin
scalia
not
if
hangs
on
sovereign
immunity.
we're
not
going
to
let
congress
decide--
justice
antonin
scalia
--what
the
states
will
do
with
their
sovereign
immunity.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
of
course...
of
course,
there
isn't
because
there's
never
been
a
creature
like
this,
and
the
argument
proves
too
much.
it...
it
would,
carried
to
its
logical
conclusion,
say
that
there's
no
state
sovereign
immunity
of
any
sort
in
its
courts
or
in
the
federal
courts--
justice
antonin
scalia
--since
the
federal
government
has...
has
taken
over
legislative
jurisdiction
from
the
state
and--
justice
antonin
scalia
--and
excluded
the
state
from
those
areas.
therefore,
anything
goes.
justice
antonin
scalia
do
you
have
any
of
the...
of
the
framers
who
expressed
that
view?
i
mean,
several
of
them
did
express
the
opposite
view--
justice
antonin
scalia
--that
they
thought
the
states
could
not
be...
could
not
be
sued
on
federal
causes
of
action
in
their
own
courts.
i
mean,
there
are
some
statements
to
that
effect.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
but
they
did
make
the
statement.
the
sovereign
is
always
immune
from
suit
in
his
own
court.
justice
antonin
scalia
you're
saying
the
states
are
not
the
sovereign
where
federal
legislation
is
concerned.
justice
antonin
scalia
they
were
really
deluding
their
listeners
if
that's
all
that
they
meant--
justice
antonin
scalia
--that...
that
a
federal
law
could
be
passed
which
would
enable
the
state...
the
state's
treasury
to
be
raided
so
long
as
the
suit
was
brought
in
the
state
courts
and
not
in
the
federal
court.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
think
that's
the
point
they
were
making.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
need
compelling
evidence,
just...
just
a
little
preponderance
is
all--
[laughter]
--is
all
we're
looking
for
here.
this
is
a
hard
question.
i'll
settle
for
a
preponderance.
justice
antonin
scalia
--how
do
you
get...
get
that
limit
in
there
just
from
the
structure?
i
think
that's
what
justice
stevens
was
asking.
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
a
peculiar
limitation.
i
think
your
case
would
be
a
lot
easier
if
you
would
acknowledge
that
the
united
states
could...
could
bring
suit
in
state
courts
or
in
federal
courts.
i...
you
understand
my
point?
it's
a
clear
limit.
justice
antonin
scalia
are
you
saying
that
the
government
could
not
pass
a
statute
which
said
that
the
federal
government
may...
may
sue
on
behalf
of
any
individual
whose
copyright
has
been
violated?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
so
it
could...
right,
but
it
could
be
remedied,
as
far
as
the
theory
of
your
case
is
concerned,
by
a
statutory
amendment.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
probably
don't...
it
probably
won't
either,
so
why
are
you
fighting
it?
[laughter]
it
seems
to
me
the
weakest
part
of
your
case.
well,
just
in
case
it
matters,
could
you--
could
you
explain
that
to
me?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
thought
we've
held
the
contrary.
is
that
what
you
were
about
to
say?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
thought
we've
held
the
contrary.
justice
antonin
scalia
--i
guess
you
can
always
ask
a
question
like
that
where
sovereign
immunity
is
at
issue.
i
mean,
by
definition,
it
precludes
claims
that
ought
to
be
brought.
justice
antonin
scalia
some
people
think
sovereign
immunity
shouldn't
exist
for
that
very
reason.
justice
antonin
scalia
--what
did
hans
v.
louisiana
say
about
this
subject?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
did
hans
v.
louisiana
suggest
about
this
subject?
did...
did
hans
suggest
that
the
sovereign
immunity
that
existed
in
federal
courts
was
only
sovereign
immunity
against...
against
causes
of
action
not
created
by
the
federal
government
itself?
