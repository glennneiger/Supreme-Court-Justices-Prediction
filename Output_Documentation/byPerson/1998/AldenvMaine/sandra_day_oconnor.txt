well,
how...
how
is
that
so?
i
thought
in
seminole
tribe
we
described
other
ways
of
enforcing
a
federal
law,
even
though
it
couldn't
be
done
directly.
i
suppose
there
are
alternative
means
of
enforcement
of
the
federal
law
at
stake.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
but
i
suppose
that
a
private
person
could
still
sue
a
state
officer
under
an
ex
parte
young
type
approach.
justice
sandra

o'connor
but
i--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
i
suppose
you
also
concede
that
a
state
can
waive
sovereign
immunity.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
i
suppose
you
also
concede
that
states
often
do
waive
sovereign
immunity
for
suits
in
their
own
courts
when
congress
passes
some
kind
of
economic
incentive
for
them
to
participate
in
the
program
and
to
waive
sovereign
immunity.
