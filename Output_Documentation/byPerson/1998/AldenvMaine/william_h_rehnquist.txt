chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
no.
98-436,
john
alden
v.
maine.
mr.
gold.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
howlett
was
not
a
suit
against
a
state,
was
it,
mr.
gold?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
gold.
general
waxman,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
general
waxman,
would
you
agree
that
there
is
no
case
from
our
court
that
squarely
decides
the
issue
before
us
now?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
howlett
didn't
involve
a
state.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
by...
by
analogy
we've
held
that
under
the
eleventh
amendment,
counties,
luning
against
new
mexico,
don't
participate
of
the...
of
the
eleventh
amendment
immunity.
it
seems
to
me
by
analogy
you
would
say
certainly
counties
do
not
participate
of
any
sovereign
immunity
that
might
exist
here.
but
you...
that
may
not
be
true
of
the
state.
i
think
you
read
too
much
into
howlett.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
the
hilton
court
respected
stare
decisis
in
part,
the
reasoning
of
which
has
been
totally
undercut
by
our
later
cases.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes.
yes,
do
provide
a
brief--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--thank
you,
general
waxman.
mr.
brann,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
didn't...
didn't
our
court
hold
in
united
states
against
california
back
in
the
'30's
or
'40's
that
the
federal
government
could
sue
a
state
in...
in
federal
court?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you...
mr.
brann,
you
don't
challenge
the
authority
of
the
federal
government
to
provide
that
federal
laws
can
be...
lawsuits
can
be
brought
in
state
courts
against
presumably
a
railroad
that's
operating
in
maine
or
some
polluter
that's...
you
say
it
just
can't
be
brought
against
the
state
itself.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
may
give
a
brief
answer.
[laughter]
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
brann.
mr.
gold,
you
have
a
minute
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
gold.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
number
98-436,
alden
against
maine
will
be
announced
by
justice
kennedy.
