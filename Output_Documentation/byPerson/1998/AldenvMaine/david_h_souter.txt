justice
david
h.
souter
mr.
brann--
justice
david
h.
souter
may
i
go
back
to
your...
your
colloquy
with
justice
stevens?
you...
you
conceded
that
the...
that
the
national
government
could
sue
in...
in
the
federal
court
to
enforce
this.
and
i'm
not
sure
that
i
understand
why
you
concede
that.
could
you
explain
that
to
me?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
but
if
the...
if
the
united
states
can
sue
in
a
federal
court
and
it
can
do
so
because
that
basically
was
implicit
in
the
plan
of
the
convention
and
the
eleventh
amendment
supposedly
reflects
that,
then
why
was
it
not...
why
was
the
same
implication
not
present,
that
when
the
national
government
is
enforcing...
seeking
to
enforce
a
valid
federal
law,
it
could
sue
in
a
state
court?
why...
why
was
the
line
of
the
implication
clearly
drawn
there?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
it
wouldn't
if
perhaps...
if
you
didn't
have
the
supremacy
clause.
but
as...
as
you
point
out,
certainly
it's...
it
was
a
fundamental
aspect
of
state
sovereignty
to
be
immune
in
its
own
courts,
but
it
was
an
equally
fundamental
aspect
of
state
sovereignty
to
control
the
law
that
will
be
enforced
in
its
courts.
and
the
supremacy
clause
has
flatly
and
unequivocally
taken
that
away
so
long
as
the
congress
is
acting
within
the
scope
of
its
article
i
authority.
so
that
if
the
congress
concededly
can
take
away
the
authority
to
make
the
law,
why
doesn't
it
follow
rather
obviously
that
congress
can
also
take
away
the
secondary
authority
to
decide
where
the
law
will
be
enforced?
justice
david
h.
souter
and
who
may
enforce
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
where?
where
is
it?
where
are
those
limits
found?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
you
did
give
up
the
right
to
control
the
law
that
will
be
enforced
in
your
own
courts.
justice
david
h.
souter
yes,
if
it's...
if
it's
a
valid
exercise
of
congress'
power
under
article
i,
you
gave
up
that
right.
justice
david
h.
souter
and...
and
isn't
the...
the
question
of...
of
which
party
enforces
the
right,
whether
it
be
the
national
government
or...
or
a
private
individual
subject
to
the
law's
benefit,
secondary
to
the
basic
jurisdictional
question
whether
the
national
government
can
make
the
operative
law?
justice
david
h.
souter
oh,
i
can...
i'll
grant
you
that
you
have
conceded
that.
but
the
basic
problem
that
both
justice
stevens
and
i,
i
think,
are
having
is...
is
a
problem
of
finding
a
coherent
theory
because
if
the...
if
the
theory
behind
your
case
is
sovereign
immunity,
then
i
think
it's
pretty
clear
that
there
is
not
going
to
be
any
exception
for
enforcement
actions
by
the
national
government
even
in
its
own
courts.
if,
on
the
other
hand,
your...
your
theory
is...
is
a
principle
which
somehow
is
reflective
of
the
eleventh
amendment,
it's
clear
the
eleventh
amendment
doesn't
apply
to
state
actions.
and
we're
left,
if
we
eliminate
those
two
possibilities,
with
essentially
the
supremacy
clause
argument,
and...
and
because
the
supremacy
clause
makes
it
clear
beyond
any
argument
that,
within
the
proper
sphere
of
article
i,
the
state
no
longer
has
a
sovereignty
to
assert
as
against
a
federal
law,
then
it
just
seems
kind
of
a
bizarre
exception
to
say,
but
that
doesn't
apply
when
the...
when
the
congress
decides
who
it
is
who
will
walk
in
the
courthouse
door
to
enforce
the
law.
we're
looking
for
some
kind
of
a
coherent
theory,
and
i'll...
you
know,
i'll
be
honest
with
you.
i
don't
see
it.
what
am
i
missing?
justice
david
h.
souter
and
it
seems
to
me
that
the
answer
to
that
question
turns
on
what
the
commerce
power
today
includes.
there's
no
question
that
the...
that
the
framers
would
have
been
very
surprised
by
the
garcia
decision.
they
didn't
expect
the
commerce
power
was
going
to
extend,
in
fact,
to
the...
to
the
limit
that
it
has
because
they
couldn't
foresee
the
growth
of
commerce.
but
once
the
framers
had
seen
that
the
commerce
power
goes
this
far,
then
i
don't
see
that
there's
much
argument
left
in...
in
the
intentions...
turning
on
the
intentions
of
the
framers
not
to
allow
a...
a
common
and
simple
enforcement
authority
to
go
along
with
the
sovereign
power
to
make
the...
the
law
that
regulates
the
commerce.
justice
david
h.
souter
here's
your
chance.
[laughter]
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
seminole...
seminole
tribe
was
a
case
about
the
article
iii
judicial
power,
and
if
seminole
tribe
had
turned
simply
on
a
theory
of
sovereign
immunity,
one
thing
is
clear
beyond
any
doubt,
there
was
no
theory
of
sovereign
immunity
in
the
18th
century
that
included
an
exception
for
the
united
states.
seminole
tribe
had
to
turn
on
the
extent
to
which
a
concept,
a
rough
idea
of
sovereign
immunity
was
embodied
in
the
eleventh
amendment
as
a
limit
on
article
iii,
but
there
is...
there
is
no
carry
over
that
i
can
see
in
seminole
tribe
to
article
i.--
justice
david
h.
souter
--well,
commerce
has.
justice
david
h.
souter
which
suggests...
which
suggests
that
article
i's
analysis
is
somehow
quite
fundamentally
different
from
article
iii's
analysis
even
if
we
accept
the
premise
of
seminole.
right?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
and...
and
hamilton...
you're
quite
right,
but
hamilton
was
also
talking
about
a
debate
over
article
iii,
wasn't
he?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
isn't
that
true
because
no
one
suggested
at
the
time
that
statutes
of
this
sort
would
ever
be
passed?
you...
you
mentioned
a
moment
ago
in...
in
the
earlier
part
of
your
answer
to
justice
breyer
that
at
the
convention
there
was
great
concern
about
individual
citizens
suing
states.
that
concern,
if
i
understand
it
correctly...
and
you
correct
me
if
i'm
wrong...
was
a
concern
about
bringing
common
law
actions,
e.g.,
actions
of
debt,
suing
on
the
revolutionary
debt.
there
was...
there
was
no...
there
was
no
advertence
whatsoever,
to
the
best
of
my
knowledge,
to
a
suit
brought...
that
might
be
brought
by
a
citizen
in
a
state
court
suing
under
a
federal
statute
passed
validly
under
article
i.
that
was
absent
from
the
discussion,
if
i
understand
it
correctly.
justice
david
h.
souter
did...
you
might
just
as
well
ask
the
question,
did
the
power
to
regulate
commerce
among
the
states,
including
subjecting
the
states
to
the
fair
labor
standards
act?
and
if
you
had
asked
that
question
at
the
time
of
the
convention,
the
answer
would
have
been,
of
course
not.
that's
ridiculous.
it's
not
ridiculous
today,
and
the
question
is,
once
the
power
to
act
under
article
i
substantively
is
conceded,
there's
nothing
left
but,
in
effect,
a...
a
totally
secondary
question--
justice
david
h.
souter
--about
enforcement.
and
to
say
that
the
one
does
not
follow
the
other
seems
very
strange.
and
i...
as
justice
breyer's
question
suggested,
i
can't
imagine
why
anyone
would
have
been
concerned
about
the
enforcement
power
who
conceded
the
power
in
the
first
place
to
legislate
substantively.
and
we
have
to
accept
that
latter
concession.
justice
david
h.
souter
right,
but
to
the
extent
that
that--
justice
david
h.
souter
then
you're...
then
it
seems
to
me
you're
back
with
the
original
problem
of
coherence.
if
your
argument
is
going
to
depend
upon
an
overarching
theory
of
sovereign
immunity
that
is
enforceable
in
the
absence
of
any
constitutional
text,
then
i
don't
see
how
you
can
concede
that
the
national
government
could
sue
in
a
federal
court
because
that
would
be
as
clearly
an
abrogation
of
that
sovereign
immunity
as...
as
a
suit
by
the
national
government
or
a
citizen
in
a
state
court.
you
can't
have
it
both
ways.
justice
david
h.
souter
didn't
the
framers,
by
the
same
token,
assume
that
there
would
not
be
commerce
power
statutes
binding
and
running
against
the
state
in
its
capacity
as
a
state?
isn't
that
equally
true?
justice
david
h.
souter
i
have
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
and
as
justice
kennedy
said
i
am
joined
by
justice
stevens,
justice
ginsburg
and
justice
breyer.
because
this
case
will
has
significance
not
only
for
the
enforceability
of
a
portion
of
the
fair
labors
standards
act
but
for
the
american
federal
structure,
generally
we
think
it
is
in
order
to
summarize
our
reasons
for
believing
that
the
court's
majority
is
mistaken
in
what
it
holds
today.
it
makes
it
easier
to
understand
today's
decision,
to
recall
just
what
the
court
held
three
terms
ago
in
the
case
of
seminole
tribe
against
florida.
there
the
same
majority
of
the
court
held
that
the
eleventh
amendment
provided
a
defense
when
a
state
was
sued
in
a
federal
court
on
a
federal
claim
by
someone
other
than
the
united
states.
the
court
held
that
the
state
could
claim
such
a
defense
under
the
eleventh
amendment
by
reading
that
amendment
as
somehow
enhanced
by
a
broader
background
principle
of
state
sovereign
immunity
to
sue
as
at
common
law.
the
majority
held
that
the
congress
could
not
abrogate
that
state
defense,
even
when
it
was
otherwise
acting
within
the
scope
of
its
power
to
legislate
under
article
i
of
the
constitution.
there
were
two
fundamental
objections
to
the
court's
reasoning
in
that
case
which
were
raised
by
the
same
four
of
us
who
dissent
today:
first,
we
pointed
out
that
the
eleventh
amendment
by
its
very
terms
did
not
give
the
state
a
defense
to
suit
in
federal
court
when
the
state
was
sued
by
someone
asserting
a
federal
right.
we
pointed
out
that
the
eleventh
amendment
gave
states
an
immunity
only
when
a
federal
court's
jurisdiction
over
them
was
its
jurisdiction
to
hear
cases
involving
parties
with
diversity
of
citizenship.
secondly,
we
pointed
out
that
sovereign
immunity
as
a
common
law
doctrine
could
always
be
changed
by
statute.
that
meant
that
when
congress
was
dealing
with
a
subject
over
which
it
has
authority
to
legislate
under
article
i
of
the
constitution
the
congress
could
waive
or
abrogate
the
state's
common
law
sovereign
immunity.
after
seminole
tribe
had
been
decided,
it
was
clear
that
one
of
the
next
questions
the
court
would
have
to
consider
would
be
whether
a
state
could
be
sued
in
its
own
courts
by
someone
claiming
a
federal
right.
it
is
accepted
law
that
when
congress
has
authority
to
legislate
under
article
i
of
the
constitution,
the
statutes
that
it
passes
are
laws
just
as
much
in
state
courts
as
in
federal
courts,
that
is
what
the
supremacy
clause
of
the
constitution
provides.
it
is
also
accepted
law
that
when
states
have
setup
courts
of
general
jurisdiction
they
cannot
without
some
very
good
excuse
to
refuse
to
apply
federal
law.
if
and
when
it
would
follow
as
a
general
proposition
the
state
courts
would
be
required
to
enforce
federal
law
even
against
the
state
in
its
own
courts
if
an
individual
sue
the
state
in
those
courts.
the
eleventh
amendment
which
was
so
important
in
seminole
tribe
would
have
nothing
to
do
with
such
a
case
in
a
state
court,
so
the
eleventh
amendment
speaks
only
to
the
power
of
federal
courts.
nor
would
common
law
sovereign
immunity
seem
to
be
any
defense
in
the
state
court
for
the
reasons
i
have
already
given.
common
law
sovereign
immunity
may
be
modified
by
statute,
and
that
means
that
if
congress
legislating
on
a
matter
within
its
authority
under
article
i
of
the
constitution,
congress
could
provide
that
a
state
would
not
enjoy
sovereign
immunity
even
in
its
own
courts
when
sued
by
an
individual
who
claimed
that
the
state
had
violated
his
federal
rights.
today's
decision
of
course
says
that
an
individual
may
not
sue
on
a
state
court
over
the
state's
objection,
even
on
a
matter
as
to
which
congress
has
abrogated
state
immunity
in
the
exercise
of
its
power
under
article
i.
but
in
order
to
do
this
the
court
must
come
up
with
rather
different
reasoning
from
what
it
employed
in
seminole
tribe.
as
i
have
mentioned
the
eleventh
amendment
is
no
use
in
this
case,
for
this
case
involves
a
state
court
not
a
federal
one.
then
there
is
the
fact
that
common
law
sovereign
immunity
can
be
modified
by
statute.
the
court
has
responded
to
these
difficulties
in
the
following
ways:
first,
the
court
has
apparently
put
forward
a
theory
of
sovereign
immunity
which
is
not
what
the
common
law
knew,
but
the
theory
of
sovereign
immunity
that
the
european
jurists
put
forward,
and
which
sir
william
blackstone
described
as
justice
kennedy
has
already
indicated
is
the
natural
law
view.
on
this
view
state
sovereign
immunity
is
not
a
doctrine
that
the
united
states
could
modify
by
congressional
statute,
even
on
a
subject
committed
to
federal
authority
under
article
i
of
the
constitution.
this
is
so
because
sovereign
immunity
on
this
natural
law,
a
conception
is
thought
to
be
what
the
court
calls
a
fundamental
aspect
of
state
sovereignty.
something
that
is
so
essential
to
the
very
concept
of
statehood
that
it
cannot
be
taken
away.
as
i
understand
the
court's
opinion
the
majority
is
saying
that
the
constitution
was
adopted
with
the
understanding
that
this
absolutist
or
indefeasible
state
sovereign
immunity
would
continue,
so
that
congressional
power
could
never
prevail
against
it
at
least
when
congress
is
acting
under
its
article
i
authority.
for
good
measure,
the
court
points
out
that
nothing
is
lost
by
the
absence
of
the
eleventh
amendment
from
its
reasoning.
for
it
says
that
the
tenth
amendment
somehow
confirms
that
this
indefeasible
sense
of
state
sovereign
immunity
was
protected
under
the
constitution.
this
is
so
on
the
court's
view,
even
though
the
constitution
does
not
at
any
place
so
much
as
mentions
state
sovereign
immunity.
the
court's
argument
is
an
historical
one.
it
must
stand
or
fall
on
the
answer
to
this
question,
whether
at
the
time
of
the
framing
of
the
constitution
and
the
adoption
of
the
tenth
amendment,
this
absolutist
natural
law
sense
of
sovereign
immunity
was
the
predominant
view
among
americans.
if
it
was
the
predominant
view
it
might
make
sense
to
say
that
the
constitution
had
been
adopted
with
the
understanding
that
the
national
power
was
subject
to
that
absolutist
view
of
sovereign
immunity.
in
fact,
however,
there
is
virtually
no
historical
evidence
whatsoever
that
americans
viewed
sovereign
immunity
as
the
majority
does
today.
virtually
all
the
evidence
points
to
the
idea
that
americans
thought
of
sovereign
immunity
is
the
common
law,
not
is
the
natural
law
of
variety.
of
course,
as
i
said
common
law
of
sovereign
immunity
was
understood
as
subject
to
modification
by
statute,
so
that
congress
should
be
able
to
modify
it
on
any
subject
that
congress
is
authorized
to
deal
with
under
article
i
of
the
constitution.
the
majority's
first
reason
then
for
saying
that
the
national
government
is
bound
by
an
indefeasible
sovereign
immunity
of
the
states
is
clearly
wrong.
not
only
that
but
even
on
the
natural
law
view
of
sovereign
immunity
a
state
would
not
been
sovereign
on
any
matter
in
which
the
state
was
not
the
lawmaker.
the
majority
has
however
a
second
reason
for
the
position
it
takes.
the
majority
says
that
the
notion
of
this
indefeasible
absolutist
sovereign
immunity
is
inherent
in
the
federal
relationship
between
the
states
and
the
national
government
if
that
relationship
is
structured
by
the
constitution.
whereas,
its
first
reason
was
that
natural
law
of
sovereign
immunity
was
inherent
in
the
notion
of
statehood.
it
also
says
that
in
indefeasible
kind
of
sovereign
immunity
is
inherent
in
the
relationship
between
the
states
and
the
national
government.
the
court
is
clearly
wrong
again.
sovereign
immunity
can
only
be
a
defense
in
a
matter
over
which
a
state
is
sovereign.
on
any
matter
committed
to
the
congress
under
article
i
of
the
constitution,
however,
the
state
is
not
the
ultimate
sovereign,
the
national
government
is.
therefore,
what
is
essential
in
the
federal
relationship
is
not
with
that
the
states
remain
immune
on
a
matter
committed
to
the
power
of
congress,
but
quite
the
opposite.
it
is
essential
that
they
not
be
immune.
the
court
could
not
be
more
fundamentally
mistaken
about
the
implications
of
the
federal
relationship.
just
how
far
the
court
is
prepared
to
follow
those
supposed
implications
is
something
we
will
learn
later.
we
will
learn
that
the
next
time
an
individual
sues
a
state
on
the
basis
of
legislation
enacted
by
congress
not
in
the
exercise
of
its
article
i
power,
but
in
the
exercise
of
its
authority
under
section
5
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
for
now
the
upshot
of
all
of
this
is
a
very
peculiar
state
of
affairs.
it
is
clear
from
the
decision
of
this
court
in
garcia
against
san
antonio
transit
authority,
that
the
national
government
can
bind
the
states
under
the
fair
labor
standards
act.
under
that
act
if
a
state
fails
to
pay
wages
to
its
employees
in
accordance
with
the
terms
of
the
act,
those
employees
may
sue
the
state
to
recover
the
wages
they
are
entitled
to.
after
seminole
tribe
however,
the
employees
may
not
sue
in
a
federal
court
and
after
today's
decision
they
may
not
sue
in
a
state
court.
they
therefore
have
a
right
in
theory
but
they
have
no
means
of
enforcing
that
right
when
the
state
refuses
to
obey
the
terms
of
the
act
and
refuses
to
pay
them
what
the
act
requires
them
to
pay.
it
is
true
that
the
government
of
the
united
states
acting
say
through
the
department
of
labor
can
sue
a
state
to
make
it
pay
the
money
it
owes
its
employees,
but
this
would
be
at
that
state
a
really
inefficient
and
ineffective
way
to
enforce
the
federal
statute.
if
or
even
though
the
national
government
can
sue,
the
fact
remains
that
as
a
result
of
today's
decision
state
employees
have
federal
rights
that
they
themselves
cannot
enforce.
this
state
of
affairs
in
fact
violates
a
very
ancient
principle
of
our
law
that
where
there
is
a
right
there
is
also
a
remedy
to
enforce
that
right.
if
this
is
a
very
peculiar
state
of
affairs,
its
peculiarity
is
even
more
striking
when
one
bears
in
mind
the
history
of
this
court's
treatment
of
the
power
of
congress
to
bind
the
states
under
the
fair
labor
standards
act.
first
it
said
in
a
case
of
maryland
and
wirtz
in
1966
that
congress
could
bind
the
state.
then
in
1976
in
the
case
of
national
league
of
cities
against
usery,
the
court
overruled
itself
and
decided
that
congress
could
not
do
so.
nine
years
after
that
however,
in
1985
this
court
changed
its
mind
again
and
in
the
case
of
garcia
and
san
antonio
decided
that
congress
could
bind
the
states.
now,
in
effect
the
court
has
largely
overruled
itself
again,
though
without
saying
so.
instead
of
saying
that
it
is
changing
its
mind
for
the
third
time
in
holding
that
congress
cannot
bind
the
states,
it
is
saying
that
the
states
are
bound,
but
that
the
individuals
who
are
supposed
to
be
paid
cannot
sue
for
the
wages
the
state
owes
them.
this
switching
back
and
forth,
though
the
congress
is
powered
to
bind
the
states
effectively
under
the
flsa
is
greatly
to
be
regretted.
if
however
the
present
majority
had
a
defensible
position
one
could
at
least
accept
this
most
recent
decision
today
with
an
expectation
of
stability
ahead.
if
it
is,
any
such
expectation
would
be
naive.
the
resemblance
of
today's
state
sovereign
immunity
to
the
lochner
era's
industrial
due
process
is
too
striking
to
miss.
the
court
began
this
century
by
imputing
immutable
constitutional
stages
to
a
conception
of
economic
self-reliance
that
was
never
true
to
industrial
life,
and
grew
instantly
fictional
with
the
years.
the
court
has
chosen
to
close
this
century
by
conferring
like
status
on
a
conception
of
state
sovereign
immunity,
that
is
true
neither
to
history
nor
to
the
structure
of
the
constitution.
i
expect
the
court's
latest
essay
in
immunity
doctrine
will
prove
the
equal
of
its
earlier
experiment
in
laissez-faire.
the
one
being
is
unrealistic
as
the
other
as
indefensible
and
probably
as
fleeting.
