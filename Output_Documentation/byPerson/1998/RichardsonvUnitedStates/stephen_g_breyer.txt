justice
stephen
g.
breyer
this
case
involves
a
criminal
statute
that
punishes
a
continuing
criminal
enterprise.
now,
the
statute
in
making
it
a
crime
in
part
says,
that
you
cannot
engage
in
a
"continuing
series"
of
drug
crimes.
to
understand
the
legal
problem
that
faces
us
and
i
have
to
admit
that
explaining
the
problem
is
the
hardest
part
of
the
case.
you
have
to
imagine
that
this
word
"series"
requires
at
least
three
separate
crimes.
now
suppose
the
government
presents
evidence
of
six
separate
crimes,
must
the
jury
unanimously
agree
about
which
particular
drug
crimes
of
those
six
constitute
the
series,
that
is
if
the
government
presents
evidence
of
say
crimes
a,b,c,d,e,
and
f,
is
it
enough
that
the
jury
agree
that
the
defendant
committed
some
three
of
those
crimes,
even
if
the
jury
disagrees
about
which
three?
for
example
suppose
all
twelve
think
the
defendant
committed
three
of
the
crimes,
the
four
jurors
thinks
he
committed
a,
b,
and
c,
four
think
he
committed,
d,e,
and
f,
four
think
he
committed
a,
b,
and
d.
is
that
enough
or
does
the
jury
have
to
agree
unanimously
about
which
of
those
three
crimes
the
defendant
committed?
now,
the
trial
court
in
this
case
agreeing
with
the
government,
instructed
the
jury
in
the
first
way
i.e.
it
must
unanimously
agree
only
the
petitioner
engaged
in
some
series
of
drug
crimes
but
it
does
not
have
to
agree
about
which
individual
crimes
constituted
the
series.
the
court
of
appeals
thought
the
district
court
was
right,
but
we
do
not
think
the
district
court
was
right.
we
hold
that
the
jury
must
unanimously
agree
about
which
of
the
underlying
individual
crimes
is
necessary
that
constitute
the
series.
now,
to
put
it
little
bit
more
legally
it
is
given
that
a
federal
criminal
jury
has
to
unanimously
agree
that
the
defendant
committed
all
the
elements
of
the
offence
before
it
can
convict
and
the
dispute
between
the
parties
in
this
case
reduces
to
whether
the
phrase
"continuing
series
of
violations"
refers
to
a
single
element
named
in
the
series,
or
whether
it
refers
to
several
elements
namely
be
underlying
crimes
that
make
up
the
series.
we
think,
the
latter.
now
the
easier
part
is
explaining
why.
the
statute
uses
the
words
"series
of
violations",
violations
refer
to
acts
that
are
contrary
to
law.
juries
acting
unanimously,
traditionally
decide
whether
a
defendant
has
conducted
himself
in
a
way
that
amounts
to
a
violation
of
the
law.
hence,
congress'
use
of
the
word
violation,
favors
our
interpretation.
we
also
draw
support
from
the
fact
that
the
statutory
word
"violations"
covers
a
large
number
of
different
drug
crimes
involving
conduct
of
vastly
different
degrees
of
seriousness.
the
government,
in
cases
like
this,
often
claims
that
a
defendant
has
been
involved
in
many
such
violations.
unless
the
statute
requires
unanimity
with
respect
to
which
underlying
crimes
the
defendant
actually
committed,
a
jury
might
not
focus
on
factual
details,
but
simply
conclude
that
with
so
much
testimony
that
the
defendant
has
committed
some
crime,
where
there
is
smoke
there
must
be
fire.
finally
our
cases
suggest
that
the
constitution
imposes
limits
upon
a
state's
power
to
define
crimes
in
ways
that
permit
conviction
even
though
the
jury
disagrees
about
the
underlying
facts.
we
do
not
believe
that
congress
here
intended
to
write
a
statute
that
would
come
even
close
to
that
limit.
we
therefore,
reverse
the
court
of
appeals
and
we
remand
the
case
to
further
proceeding.
justice
kennedy
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
justices
o'connor
and
ginsburg
have
joined.
