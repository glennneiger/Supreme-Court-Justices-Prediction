mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
it
is
an
established
principle
of
the
criminal
law
that
while
a
jury
must
unanimously
agree
that
the
prosecution
has
proven
the
elements
of
an
offense,
it
need
not
agree
on
the
evidence
supporting
each
element.
as
applied
to
the
cce
statute,
that
principle
means
that
the
jury
must
unanimously
agree
that
the
defendant
engaged
in
a
continuing
series
of
violations,
but
it
need
not
agree
on
the
particular
acts
that
make
up
such
a
series.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
the
schad
case
and
the
cases
that
precede
schad
establish
the
basic
controlling
principle
here,
which
is
that
the
only
thing
that
a
jury
has
to
be
unanimous
about
is
the
elements
of
the
offense
and
the
jurors
do
not
have
to
agree
on
the
evidence
that
support
each
element.
in
schad,
the
crime
was
murder,
and
in
schad,
some
jurors...
six
jurors
could
think
it
was
a
felony
of
robbery,
six
jurors
could
believe
there
was
an
intent
to
kill.
as
long
as
they
all
agreed
that
the
relevant
mens
rea
was...
was
established,
they
did
not
have
to
be
unanimous.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
now
you're
talking
about
for
a
cce?
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
well,
you...
you
would
have
to
show
a
continuing
series,
and
i'm
not
sure
that
just
one...
one
event
would
do
it
for
a
continuing
series,
but--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--right.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
right.
when...
if
we...
in
the
basic
way
the
government
charges
a
case
like
this,
as
long
as
all
the
acts
were
undertaken
pursuant
to
a
single
course
of
conduct,
it
should
not
matter
whether
half
the
jurors
pick
out
the
three
at
one
high
school
and
half
the
jurors
pick
out
a
series
at
another
high
school.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
right.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
justice
kennedy,
that...
the
same
result
would
follow.
just
as
in
schad,
if
six
jurors
had
concluded
there
was
no
robbery
at
all
and
six
jurors
had
concluded
there
was
no
intent
to
kill
at
all,
they
would
still
unanimously
agree
on
the
relevant
mens
rea.
all
that...
that...
the
question
of
what
is
an
element
of...
of
an
offense
is
essentially
a
question
of
statutory
construction.
what
did
congress
intend
for
the
elements
of
an
offense
to
be?
here
the
text
of
the
act
expressly
says
that
the
relevant
element
is
that
there
must
be
a
continuing
series
of
violations.
given
that
definition
of
the
element,
the
only
thing
that
the
jury
must
be
unanimous
about
is
that
the
defendant
engaged
in
a
continuing
series
of
drug
violations.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
no...
no,
it--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--you
were
right
to
correct
me,
justice
scalia.
the
first
question
is
one
of
legislative
intent.
what
did
congress
intend
for
the
element
to
be?
once
you
know
what
congress
intended
for
the
elements
to
be,
there
is
then
a
due
process
question
about
whether
congress
can
rationally...
rationally
define
the
elements
of
the
offense
in
the
way
that
it
did.
and
the...
the
hypothetical
of
he...
she
struck
a
on
monday
or
b
on
tuesday
is
completely
unlike
this
cce
statute
in
due
process
terms.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
we
do
not
agree
with
that,
justice--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--we
do
not
agree
on
that.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
they
do
have
to
agree
about
the
elements
of
the
offense,
but
not
the
facts
underlying
it.
and
what
the...
what
the
first
element...
we
would
acknowledge
it
is
a
more
difficult
question
because
if
you
look
at
the
first
element
in
isolation,
it
does
look
like
it's
focusing
on
a
discrete
act
by
a
single
defendant.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
but
when
you
read
it
in
the
context
of
the
whole
statute,
which
is...
the
following
sentence
says
that
that's
just
part
of
a
series
of
violations,
it's
best
understood
as
really
the
functional
equivalent
of
saying,
there
must
be
a
series
of
violations
at
least
one
of
which
took
place
within
the
statute
of
limitations
period.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
well,
you'd
have
to
prove
a
series,
but
the--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--correct.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
well,
first
of
all,
a
series...
presumably
they
would
all
have
to
agree
that
there
were
at
least
three
or
at
least
two
depending
on
how
you
defined
a
series.
but
to
answer
your
hypothetical,
justice
scalia,
the
question
in
that
case
would
be
is
congress
or
the
legislature,
whoever
it
was,
responding
to
a
new
and
distinct
form
of
criminal
activity
or
is
it
simply
attempting
to
circumvent
unanimity
requirements
for
what
have...
what
has
been
an
historical
single
offense
of
burglary.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
justice
scalia,
i'm
not
sure
about
the
background
that
you're
speaking
of,
but
i
don't
think
it's
fair
to
compare
this
statute
to
a
recidivism
statute.
it
is
not.
it
is
a
completely
different
kind
of
statute.
what
it
is...
what
congress
was
addressing
here
was
a
new
kind
of
crime,
and
that
is
the
operation
by
drug
kingpins
of
large
scale
drug
businesses
from
which
they
derive
substantial
revenues.
it
is
not
just
somebody
committed
one
crime
and
then
another.
it
is
a
drug
business
crime,
and
that's
why
it's
called
continuing
criminal
enterprise.
and
in...
in
responding
to
that
distinct
form
of
criminal
activity,
it
was
entirely
rational
for
congress
to
say...
to
define
the
series
element
so
as
to
require
agreement
on
a
series
but
not
on
the
particular
acts.
and
i
would
also
distinguish
this
case
from
the...
the
case
where
you
just
have
to
prove
a
series
because
there
are
other
elements
to
this
offense.
the
government
has
to
prove
that
there
was
a
conspiracy.
it
has
to
prove
that
the...
the...
that
the
defendant
derived
substantial
revenues
from
that
conspiracy,
and
the
addition
of...
of
those
elements
helps
to
establish
that
what
congress
was
doing
was
responding
to--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
i
have
to
work
through
that
hypothetical
a
second,
justice--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--and
then
there's
one
overriding--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--one
overriding--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--right.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
that's
possible,
and...
and
that
is
possible--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--it
is
but
it's
highly
unlikely,
justice
stevens,
that
anything
like
that
would
ever
happen,
but
if
it
did,
it
would
be--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--well,
i
would...
i
would...
i
would
question
that,
but
if...
if
that
unusual
thing
did
happen,
it
would...
you
would...
you
would
convict
for
the
same
reason
that
there's
a
conviction
when
six
jurors
think
that
there's
a
robbery
and
they're
convinced
beyond
any
doubt
that
there's
not
intent
to
murder
and...
and
six
are
convinced
that
there's
an
intent
to
murder
and
convinced
beyond
any
doubt
that
there's
no
robbery.
and
that
is
the--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--i
just
don't--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--justice
scalia,
i--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--well,
i
think
what
it
would...
would
harm
are
the
modern
statutes
and...
for
which
there
are
no
precedent
and
because--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--you
could.
you
could
charge
one
or
the
other.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
mr.
chief
justice,
i
just
think
that
illustrates
that
there's
really
not
a...
a
strong
principle
behind
it
because
even
if
you
take
schad,
i'm
not
sure
what
the
distinction
is
when
you
say,
robbery
is
a
separate
offense,
but
we'll
move
robbery
in
as
part
of
murder
and
say
half
of
the
jurors
only
half
defined
it
and
then
they
found
an
element
of
the
offense.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
i
don't
see
the
distinction.
what
we
have
here
is
the
element
is
defined
that
we're
dealing
with
as
a
continuing
series
of
violations.
and
it's
true,
that's
not
the
whole
crime,
but
it
seems
to
me
the
same
analysis
would
apply
to
a
particular
element.
and
that
is--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--but
schad
announced
a
principle
that
was
broader
than
just
the
means.
it
was
a
distinction
between
what
is
the
element
and
what
are
the
facts
that
helped
to
prove
the
element,
the
element
as
defined
by
the
legislature.
then
once
you
answer
that
question,
you
have
a
second
question
which
is,
did
the
legislature
define
the
element
in
a
rational
way?
but
the
first
question
is
just
a
question
of
statutory
interpretation
under
schad,
and
here
the
text
of
the
act
says
that
all
the
element
is
is
proof
of
a
continuing
series
of
violations.
given
that
definition
of
the
element,
the
only
thing
the
jury
has
to
be
unanimous
about
is
that
there's
such
a
series.
and
now
we
have
a
question.
did
congress...
is
that
a
rational
way
to
proceed?
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
as
i
said--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--well,
it
may
be
if
there's
not
a
distinctive
form
of
criminal
activity
that's
being
addressed,
but
there's
a
big
difference
between
just
requiring
proof
of
a
series,
as
in
your
hypotheticals,
and
requiring
proof
of
a
conspiracy
from
which
the
defendant--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--they
can,
yes.
i
think
if
you...
even
if
you
had
a
crime
like
reckless
driving
and
a
number
of
things...
and
that
was
the
definition
of
the
crime,
and
a
number
of
things
happened,
he
turned
into
the
right
lane,
he
sped,
he
did
a
number
of
things,
you
could
charge
the
crime
of
reckless
driving.
and
then
as
long
as
the
jurors
agreed
that
he
was
recklessly
driving,
they
wouldn't
have
to
agree
on
the
particular
facts
that
convinced
them
that
he
was
recklessly
driving.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
well,
one
thing
you
have
to
decide
is
what
is
congress
defining
as
the
element
of
an
offense.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
in
some...
in
some
cases
there
could
be
two...
two
separate
acts,
each
of
which...
for
example,
if
you
take
a
drug
distribution,
each
drug
distribution
is
a
separate
offense
that
is
charged
and
punishable
as
such.
and
therefore,
you
could
not
charge
an
either/or,
either
he
distributed
a
or
b.
that
would
be
two
distinct
offenses.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
here
in
this
case
what
we
have--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--that's
right.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
i
would
have
to
look
at
each
one
of
those
statutes
to
see
whether
what
we're
talking
about
is
separate
crimes
or
not--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--or
just
alternative
ways
of--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--but
still
you'd
have
to
decide
whether
each
source
that
you
got
it
for
really
created...
or
purpose
really
created
a
separate
crime.
you'd
have
to
decide--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--right.
that
sounds
like--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--that
sounds
very
much
like
a
case
where
you
walk
in
on
a
burglary
and
you
could
have
various
intents,
and
as
long
as
the
jury
finds
one
of
the
intents
to
commit
a
felony,
then
you've
got
a
burglary.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
and...
well,
there's
always
a
constitutional
question
at
the...
at
the
back
end
which
asks
is
this
a
rational
way
to
define
an
offense.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
so
long
as
that
is
one
offense,
and
that
looks
very
much
like
schad
to
me
where
six
people--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--six
people
could
conclude
that
somebody
committed
a
robbery,
and
six
could
be
absolutely
convinced
that
there
was
no
robbery;
and
six
could
be
absolutely
convinced
that
there's
an
intent
to
kill
and
six
could
be
absolutely
convinced
that
there
was
no
intent
to
kill.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
i...
i
think
that
you
can
start
in
this
case
with
realizing
that
this
act
starts
with
a
conspiracy.
under
rutledge,
it
said
that
we
have
a
conspiracy
plus
other
elements.
here
all
the
predicates
charged
were
undertaken
pursuant
to
a
single
conspiracy.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
we
did
not
specifically
mention
conspiracy
as
a
predicate
act.
conspiracy
was
in
a
separate
count,
but
it
was
very
clear
from
count
1
and
count
2
that
the
very
continuing
criminal
enterprise
was...
was
undertaken
pursuant
to
the
conspiracy
that
was
set
out--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--no.
there
was
just
one
conspiracy
charged
in
the
indictment.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
there
was
only
one
and
it
was
a
conspiracy
to
distribute
drugs--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--it
is...
that
is
the
way
the
government
charges
these
cases,
justice
scalia.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
not
necessarily,
justice
scalia,
because
in
that
hypothetical
you
could
borrow
some
of
the
principles
from
conspiracy
law
where
when
there...
the
government
charges
a
single
conspiracy
and
in
fact
it
turns
out
there
may
be
multiple
conspiracies,
then
a
jury
could
get
a
separate
charge
about
whether
there
was
a
different
conspiracy
than
the
one
the
government
was
agreeing
to.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
well,
no.
i
don't...
i
think
that
one
of
the
things
that
you
don't
have
to
worry
about
is
how...
that
congress
really
was,
and
all
these
elements
of
the
offense
established,
responding
to
a
new
and
distinct
form
of
criminal
activity.
it
wasn't
just
taking
a
traditional
offense
and
wiping
out
unanimity.
it
saw
a
whole
new
kind
of
criminal
activity
which
was
the
operation
by
drug
kingpins
of
drug
businesses
from
which
they
derived
substantial
revenues.
nobody
disputes
that
that
was
a
new
and
distinct
form
of
criminal
activity
that
congress
was
confronted
with.
and
the
question
you
have
to
ask
yourself
is,
in
responding
to
that
kind
of
problem,
was
congress
acting
rationally
in
defining
the
elements
of
the
offense--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--well,
but
you
have
to
look...
look
at
the
elements
of
this
offense.
there
has
to
be
a
conspiracy.
there
has
to
be
a
series
of
violations.
there
has
to
be
substantial
revenues
derived
from
the
conspiracy.
that
spells
out
pretty
clearly
exactly
the
problem
that
congress
was
faced
with.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
well,
first
of
all,
i
don't
think
this,
for
the
reasons
that
i've
said,
that
this
is
the
same
as
an
habitual
offender
statute.
but
second
of
all,
there
are
other
state
law
crimes
that
to
some
extent
have
gone
to
define
a
series
as
the
basis
for
the
crime.
for
example,
child
abuse
is
a...
is
a
classic
example
where
all
the
jury
has
to
agree
upon
is--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--the--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--well,
you
can't
find
one.
if
there's
just
one,
then
you
find
one.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
well,
if
there's...
i'm
not
sure
i'm
following
the
hypothetical.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
no,
no.
i'm
sorry.
which...
which
part
of
my
position
are
you
questioning?
that's--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--no,
but
i
think
if
they
all
agree
there's
one
essential
conspiracy
that
they
don't
have
to
agree
to
every
single
part
or
element
or
crime
that
was
committed
in
connection
with
that
conspiracy.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
that's
right,
and
that's
what...
that
was
what
was
charged
here.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
no,
i
think
that
you
did
agree
that
there
was...
that
they
were
the
same
in
this
sense.
they
were
all
undertaken
pursuant
to
a
single
conspiracy
that
was
managed
and
led
by
the
defendant
from
1984
to
1991.
it
involved
the
sale
of
all
three
kinds
of
drugs
in
the
area
of
chicago,
illinois.
that
was
the...
the
very
conspiracy
charged
in
count
1,
and
that
they
were
all...
all
the
acts
were
undertaken
pursuant
to
that
single
conspiracy
and
they
were
a
single
course
of
related
conduct
in
that
sense.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
that's
correct.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
i
don't
think
that
was
the
principle
the
court
was
articulating
in
schad.
i
just
think--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--but
i
think
that
what
you've
articulated
is
just
that
that
answers
a
second
objection
that
there
may
be
here,
a
notice
objection.
there
really
isn't
a
notice
objection
here.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
i
understand
that,
justice...
i'm
just
saying
that
to
the
extent
that
what's
being
raised
is
a
notice
objection,
that
the
fact
that
this...
you
get
the
same
notice
that
you
get
on
a
conspiracy
charge
completely
answers
that.
i
realize
there
is
a
separate
question
that
needs
to
be
asked
and
answered
about
the
unanimity
question,
and
there
our
position
is,
as
i
have
said,
that
the
element
here,
as
defined
by
congress,
as
clear
as
it
could
be,
it's
a
continuing
series
of
violation,
and
the
underlying
facts
just
help
to
establish
that
element.
and
then
all
you
have
left
is
a
constitutional
question
which
is,
in
light
of
our
traditions
and
in
light
of
the
modern
problem
that
congress
was
faced
with,
did
it
rationally
reach
the
conclusion
that
this
was--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--well,
it
was...
there
may
have
been,
but
not
the
persistence...
the
pervasiveness
of
the
problem
is...
and
the
ineffectiveness
of
prior
solutions
is
what
led--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--i
think
there
is
quite
a
difference
between
somebody
who
commits
a...
just
a...
a
repeat
offender
and
somebody
who
is
operating
a
drug
business
and
is...
and
part
of
that
drug
business
from...
has
literally
thousands
and
thousands
of
street
sales
over
the
course
of
time
and
is
deriving
from
that
millions
of
dollars.
and
that's
the
distinction.
