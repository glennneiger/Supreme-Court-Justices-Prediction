unknown
speaker
and...
and
what
is
the
principal
authority
for
that
proposition?
unknown
speaker
what
is
the
principal
authority
for
that
proposition?
winship?
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
i
had
thought
in...
in
schad
there
was
some
indication
that
different
jurors
can
be
persuaded
by
different
pieces
of
evidence
so
long
as
they
all
agree
on
the
bottom
line.
i...
i
think
there's
some
indication
that
jurors
don't
have
to
view
each
piece
of
evidence
unanimously--
unknown
speaker
--if
they
agree
on
the
bottom
line.
unknown
speaker
guilt
or
not
guilt
of
the
charged
offense.
unknown
speaker
and
if
it's
part
of
a
continuing
series
of
violations,
and
it
doesn't
say
how
many
or
what.
i
mean,
i'm
not
sure
that
you
can
pin
this
statute
down
as
you
would
seek
to
do
it.
unknown
speaker
well,
congress
didn't
seem
to
pin
it
down.
unknown
speaker
now,
in
rico
you've
got
a
much
more
precise
scheme
spelled
out
than
here.
congress
just
said
a
continuing
series
of
violations.
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
well,
there
was
ample
evidence
here
of,
if
you
will,
a
continuing
series.
unknown
speaker
well,
there
was
plenty
of
evidence
to
support
the
findings
necessary.
your
complaint
is
just
about
the
instruction,
is
it
not?
unknown
speaker
mr.
barnett--
--the
statute
requires
in
section
1
that
you
violate
a
provision
of
the
chapter
and
commit
a
felony.
unknown
speaker
you're
not
alleging
that
there
was
a
defect
in...
in
the
findings
as
to
that
part
of
the
statute,
are
you?
you're
just
addressing
subclause
2,
which
is
the
continuing
series.
unknown
speaker
pardon
me.
a
defect
in
the
proof
under
the
statute.
unknown
speaker
my
own
questions
are
imprecise.
are
you
saying
that
there
is
an
insufficient
finding
on
the
part
of
the
jury
with
reference
to
paragraph
1
of
the
statute
as
well
as
to
paragraph
2?
unknown
speaker
well,
what
do
you
mean
violative
of
the
constitution?
unknown
speaker
well,
that's
the
indictment.
there's
nothing
wrong
with
the
indictment
here.
the
indictment
gives
him
notice
of
what
he's
charged
with.
unknown
speaker
supposing
in
this
case,
there
had
been
evidence
of
six
other
convictions...
criminal
enterprises
that
met
that
definition,
and
the
judge
had
charged
the
jury
that
you
must
find
that
the
person
committed
three
of
those
offenses.
now,
do
you
think
that
the
law
requires
that
the
jurors
agree
on
which
three
of
the
six
were
committed?
unknown
speaker
what
about
if
you
have
thousands?
because
wasn't
that
the
government's
case?
to
talk
in
the
abstract
about
agreeing
on
the
particulars
versus
the
conclusion
is
one
thing,
but
here
the
government
says
where
we
have
a
continuing
series
that
involves
thousands
of
separate
transactions
and
they
didn't--
unknown
speaker
--was
the
prosecutor
wrong
in
saying
that
that
was
the
series?
he
said
every
$10
bag
of
crack,
every
$20
bag
of
heroin,
each
one
of
those
sales
was
a
transaction
in
this
series,
and
he
said
that
the
proof
supported
literally
thousands
of...
and
from
the
thousands,
the
jury
is
supposed
to
pick
out
three
or
four?
that
just
seems
to
make
no
sense
to
me.
unknown
speaker
first,
did
the
government
charge
that...
that
that
was
the...
that's
the
continuing
enterprise
that
they
were
dealing
with,
one
that
involved
thousands
of
transactions?
are
you
challenging
that
that
was
an
accurate
characterization
of
the
series
that
the
government
charged?
unknown
speaker
and
the
judge
is
supposed
to
tell
the
jury,
this
case
involves
thousands
of
transactions,
but
you
have
to
pick
out
three
and
agree
on
those.
if
that's
so,
then...
then
doesn't
the
judge
have
to
list
all
the
thousands,
every
runner
who
testified?
they
didn't
remember
their
individual
sales,
but
they
were
able
to
say,
yes,
we
sold
on
an
average
of
so
much
a
week,
so
much
a
day.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
guess
nobody
made
the
government
charge
thousands,
did...
did
they?
unknown
speaker
they
could
have
charged
just
10.
unknown
speaker
they're
just
being
greedy
here.
they
could
have
charged
five,
maybe
three.
right?
unknown
speaker
and
they
could
have
provided
a
lot
of
evidence
for...
for
just
those
three
or
those
five.
unknown
speaker
why
should
they
be
able
to
do...
why
should
they
have
to
do
that
more
or
less
than
they
have
to
point
to
the
five
people?
unknown
speaker
but,
i
mean,
in
terms
of
your...
in
terms
of
knowledge
of
the
defendant,
in
terms
of
your
knowledge
as
a
defense
attorney,
when
you
see
the
indictment,
does
it
list
the
five
people
by
name?
does
it
have
to?
unknown
speaker
no.
all
right.
so,
what
do
you
do
if
you
want
to
know
who
they
are?
unknown
speaker
exactly.
and
so,
i...
i
suppose
that
that's
just
what
you
would
do
in
respect
to
the
offenses
as
well,
if
you
lose
this
case.
and
you
may
win
it,
but...
but...
but...
but
if
you'd
lose
it,
it
wouldn't
be
a
problem
of
notice.
it
would
be
the
same
problem,
wouldn't
it?
you'd
say
i
don't
know
who
they
are
and
file
a
bill
of
particulars.
and...
and...
so,
i
don't
see
there's
a
notice
problem.
unknown
speaker
suppose
there
are
thousands
of
people,
thousands
of
people.
indeed,
there
may
have
been
in
this
case.
unknown
speaker
if...
if
you're
worried
about
that,
isn't
your
move
to
move
for
a
bill
of
particulars?
unknown
speaker
in
other
words,
you
want...
you
want
to
have
to
prepare
for
less.
that's
the
guts
of
your
argument,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
because
if
you
got
a
list
of
a
thousand
names,
you...
you
would
have
exactly
the
same
problem
that
you've
got
right
now.
unknown
speaker
so,
what
you're
really
saying
is,
i
have
a
right
to...
to
prepare,
in
effect,
the...
the
narrowest
and
most...
and
hence
most
manageable
case
possible.
that's...
that's
basically
your
argument.
unknown
speaker
that's
not
necessarily...
excuse
me.
go
ahead.
isn't
there
an
intermediate
position?
i'm
trying
to...
could
it
not
be
true
that
there
are
three
or
four
witnesses
who
could
testify
that
i
sold
heroin
on
a
such
and
such
a
street
corner
over
and
over
again
for
5
years?
i
can't
remember
any
specific
date
or
any
specific
transaction,
but
i
did
it
over
and
over
again.
and
then
there's
another
witness
who
says,
as
i
guess
in
this
case,
he
sold
white
heroin,
somebody
sold
brown
heroin,
somebody
sold
cocaine.
they
might
not
remember
the
specific
details,
but
did
you
argue
that
they
at
least
ought
to
be
compelled
to
find
that
there
were...
they
agreed
on
which
series
took
place?
in
other
words,
if
they
agreed
that
the
witness
who
testified
that
there
were
transactions
in
brown
heroin
for
6
months
in
a
row,
i
can't
remember
any
specific
transaction,
that
that
would
be
enough
for
a
series
if
they
all
agreed
on
that
particular
series?
but
here
you've
got
several
series.
and
did
you
argue
that
they
have
to
at
least
agree
on
which
ones
were
proved
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
or
did
you
just
make
the
argument
you
got
to
pinpoint
the
time
and
date
of
particular
sales?
unknown
speaker
in
the
district
court.
unknown
speaker
what
did
you...
did
you
ask
the
judge
to
say...
give
you
an
instruction
that
it
was
something
not
quite
as
specific
as
they've
got
to
tell
me
the
time,
date,
and
amount
of
heroin
sold
on
such
and
such...
you
know,
on
such
and
such
a
transaction?
it
seems
to
me
there's
a
big
difference.
unknown
speaker
would
have
required
time
and
date
and
place
of
three
or
four
specific
transactions.
unknown
speaker
no.
unknown
speaker
what
was
the
sentence
before
the
however?
unknown
speaker
we
don't
really
know
that
the
government...
i
guess
we
can
ask
the
government
when
it
comes
up,
but
we
don't
really
know
that
the
government
concedes
that
the
jury
has
to
decide
upon
a
particular
series.
i
suspect
the
government's
view
will
be
that
if
nine
jurors
believed
without
a...
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
that...
and
all
nine
of
them
believed
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
that
this
defendant
engaged
in
a
series
of
drug
transactions,
it
doesn't
matter
which
series
each
of
the
jurors
had
in
mind
so
long
as
all...
all
of
them
believed
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
that
there
was
some
series.
unknown
speaker
you
don't
like
that
either.
unknown
speaker
that's
even
worse
i
suppose.
right?
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
you
might
ask
what
the
other
three
jurors--
[laughter]
how
do
you...
what
do
you
think
about
the
robbery
statute,
whoever
by
force
and
violence
or
by
intimidation
takes
money
from
a
federally
insured
bank?
how
does
the
government
have
to
proceed
there
if
they
have...
where
they're
not...
there
are
some
people
who
think
that
force
and
violence
but
not
intimidation
this
particular
defendant
used
and
some
think
it's
intimidation
but
not
force
or
violence?
now,
does
the...
do
you
have
to
have
unanimity
on
each
of
those
if
they
say,
we're
certain
of
one
thing,
he
did
it
one
way
or
the
other,
but
we're
not
certain?
some
of
them
think
it's
force
and
violence;
some
of
them
think
it's
intimidation.
that
sounds
familiar.
that's
called
schad.
unknown
speaker
all
right.
now,
all
right,
fine.
so...
so,
what's
the
difference?
unknown
speaker
what
about
justice...
i
think
it
was
justice
scalia's
hypothetical
in
his
concurring
opinion
in
schad
that
a
person
is
charged
with
first
degree
murder
and
there's
evidence
that
the...
the
killing
was
committed
in
the
course
of
a
felony?
there's
also
evidence
that...
that
the
defendant
intended
and
deliberated.
does
the...
do
the
jurors
have
to
pick
between
those
two
theories
of
first
degree
murder?
unknown
speaker
what's...
what's
an
actus
reus?
unknown
speaker
what
the
defendant
did?
unknown
speaker
he'd
be
entitled
to
a
severance
certainly.
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
and
you
would
say
that...
that
that
rule
applies
in
the
hypothetical
where
six
jurors
think
the
dope
was
sold
at
high
school
1,
six
jurors
think
the
dope
was
sold
at
high
school
2.
they
don't
disagree
necessarily
with
the
findings
of
the
other
six,
but
they
just
focus
on
a...
on
a
different
high
school.
unknown
speaker
they
don't
come
to
any
conclusion.
they
don't...
they
don't
negate
that
finding.
they
just
say
i...
in
going
around
the
jury
table,
six
say,
i'm
convinced
he
sold
it
at
high
school
number
1;
six
jurors
say,
i'm
convinced
he
sold
it
at
high
school
number
2.
isn't
that
just
the
mode
of
committing
a
series
of...
of
transactions?
unknown
speaker
you
think
my
hypothetical
is
the
same
as
your
example
of
assaulting
x
on
tuesday
and
y
on
wednesday?
unknown
speaker
well,
the
trouble
that...
the
trouble
is
i
don't
think
you
can
differentiate
it
from...
from
schad
by
saying
that
schad
was
essentially
a
case
on
characterization.
you
said,
well,
it's
a
case
about
characterization
because
it
wasn't
a
case
in
which
anything
turned
on...
on
distinctions
of
what
you
called
the
actus
reus.
but
it
seems
to
me
that...
that
it
did.
take
the...
the
homicide
example,
the
homicide
in
a
case
which...
in
a
state
which
defines
homicide
in...
in
unitary
terms.
in...
one
alternative
for
proving
a
homicide
would
be
to
prove
as
a
fact
that
the
defendant
went
through
a
certain
thought
process,
i.e.,
deliberation
and
premeditation.
another
alternative
for
proving
that
homicide...
the
same...
the
same
victim...
would
be
to
prove
as
a
fact
that
the
defendant
was
engaged
in
robbery
at
the
time
he
killed.
the
distinction
between
those
two
cases
is
not
a
distinction
in
characterization.
it's
a
distinction
between
two
different
facts,
the
fact
of
thought,
the
fact
of
robbery.
and...
and
i
don't
see
how
you
can
distinguish
schad
as
a
characterization
case.
am
i...
do
i
misunderstand
your
argument?
unknown
speaker
we
don't
know
whether
the
jury
agrees
that
there
was
a
certain
thought
process
or
whether
the
jury
agrees
that
there
was
a
robbery.
unknown
speaker
the
moral
equivalence
test
isn't
going
to
help
you
in...
in
the
case
of
the
tuesday
or
the
thursday
crime.
unknown
speaker
i
mean,
i
think...
i
think
in
order
to...
to
make...
in
order
to
avoid
having
those
kinds
of
distinctions
get
into
this
case,
we've
got
to
recognize
that
schad
was,
among
other
things,
making
the...
the
due
process
judgment
based
on...
on
traditions
of
how
we
prove
crimes.
and...
and
one
tradition
that
would
pretty
clearly
be
excluded
would
be
the...
the...
the...
the
charge
simply
of
one
crime,
choosing
one
day
and
one
victim,
another
day
and
another
victim
as
an
alternative.
and
that
may
be
a
very
strong
argument
for
the
government...
against
the
government's
desire
to...
to
sort
of
have
the
whole
hog
here
and
say
that...
that
even
the...
as
it
were,
the
principal
act
here
could
be
proven
in
any
of
alternative
ways.
but
i
thought
the
case
that
you
had
brought
to
us
was
whether
in
addition
to
proving
the...
the
principal
act
here,
the
series
could
be
proven
in
alternative
ways.
and...
and
i
think
my
point
is
you
can't
distinguish
the
alternative
ways
of
proving
a
series
from
the
situation
in
schad
by
saying
that
schad
was
merely
a
case
about
characterization
because
schad
was
a
case
about
different
acts.
unknown
speaker
well,
it
doesn't
because
we
don't
have
the
kind
of
historical
precedent
one
way
or
the
other
that
you're
talking
about.
and
that's
why
i
tried
to
pin
you
down
a
little
bit
to
find
out
what
in
practical
terms
is
really
bothering
you
here.
and
i
thought
what's
really
bothering
you
is...
is
the
problem
of...
of
case
preparation.
you
want
to
be
in
a
position
to...
to
narrow
down
the
facts
which
you've
got
to
negate,
assuming
you
put
on
a
defense
or
cross
examine,
and
i
thought
that
was...
that
was
what
you
were
in
practice
really
worried
about
here.
unknown
speaker
well,
suppose
congress
wants...
wants
to
pass
a
statute
that
says
we
want
to
get
at
these
operations
where
there
are
lots
of
runners
and
people
who
will
not
be
able
to
tell
you
precisely
any
particular
sale,
but
will
be
able
to
testify
in
gross,
i
sold
x...
on
average
x
many
bags
a
week.
suppose
congress
wanted
to
get
at
that.
could
it?
or
are
you
saying,
no,
because
you
have
to
prove
discrete
acts?
unknown
speaker
this
is
a
runner
who
says,
i'm
in
the
business
of
selling
crack.
i
can't
tell
you...
i've
been
doing
it
for
years...
on
any
given
day
who...
who
i
sold
it
to.
suppose
congress
thinks
that
that
exists
in
the
real
world
and
wants
to
make
a
crime
that
covers
that.
are
you
saying
they
can't?
unknown
speaker
thank
you,
mr.
barnett.
mr.
gornstein,
we'll
hear
from
you.
unknown
speaker
and
what...
what
is
the
best
authority
for
that
from
this
court?
unknown
speaker
and
six
jurors
could
think
that
the
drugs
were
sold
at
high
school
1
and
six
jurors
at
high
school
2
and
that
would
suffice?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
no.
i'm
assuming
that
there
was
a
series
of
transactions--
unknown
speaker
--at
high
school
1
and
a
series
of
transactions
at
high
school
2.
unknown
speaker
suppose
that
half
the--
--well,
who
decides
that
they
were
all--
--suppose
that
half
the
jurors
think
that
it
didn't
happen
at
all
at
high
school
1,
but
that
it
happened
at
high
school
2,
and
the
six
other
jurors
think--
unknown
speaker
--just
the
opposite,
that
it
didn't
happen
at
all
in
high
school
2,
but
it
happened
at
high
school
1.
unknown
speaker
but
it
isn't
just
a
question
of
intent.
you
wouldn't
say
that
the
government
could
enact
a
crime
which
says
anyone
who,
you
know,
is...
is
either
guilty
of...
of
filing
an
incorrect
income
tax
return
or
of...
of
rape
shall
go
to
jail
for
30
years,
and
then
throw
it
to
the
jury
and
let
the
jury
decide.
you
know,
you
have
some
evidence
of
rape,
some
evidence
of
failure
to
file
a
proper
income
tax
return.
none
of
the...
on
neither
count
can
you
get
12
jurors,
but
you
get
6
on
one
and
6
on
the
other.
can
the
government
do
that?
unknown
speaker
so
long
as
it
intends
to
do
it.
that's
really
what
the
government
intends.
unknown
speaker
what
if
the
series...
you
say
so
long
as
it's
rational.
what
if
the
series
elements
were
not
tagged
on
to
a...
a
concrete
violation
that
you
needed
12
jurors
for?
incidentally,
you
agree
you
needed
12
jurors
for
part
1
of
the
statute.
unknown
speaker
you
don't
even
think
you
need
12--
unknown
speaker
--you
don't
have
to
have
this
jury
agree
about
anything.
unknown
speaker
it
sure
does.
unknown
speaker
so,
you...
you
think
congress
could
enact
a
statute
which
says,
anyone
who
is
guilty
of
a
series
of
burglary
shall
go
to
jail
for
so
many
years,
and
if
you
put
the
statute
that
way,
you
would
not
have
to
prove
to
the
satisfaction
of
12
jurors
any
burglary.
unknown
speaker
you'd
have
to
prove
a
series.
unknown
speaker
three
think
this
burglary,
three
think
another
one,
three
think
a
third
one,
and
three
think
a
fourth
one,
and
this
fellow
goes
to
jail
even
though,
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
no
12
people
think
he
did
anything
that
was
illegal.
unknown
speaker
schad
was
decided
mostly
on
the
basis
of
tradition.
it
had
been
done
this
way,
you
know,
for
a
long
time.
and
if
i
had
to
apply
the
same
rule
to
the
present
case,
i
would
look
to
those
cases
that...
that
dealt
with
recidivism.
and
as
i...
you
know,
you're
guilty
of
this
offense.
you'll...
if...
if
you
have
committed
a
prior
offense
as
well,
you...
you
have
a
higher
sentence.
and
let's
assume
that
they're
both
elements
of
the...
of
the
offense.
and
in
those
cases,
as
i
understand
the
historical
background,
you
had...
you
had
to
prove
the
prior
offense
by
a
unanimous
jury
and
you
couldn't
say
the
jury...
you
know,
the
jury
thinks
you
committed
a
prior
crime.
unknown
speaker
--may
i
give
you
this...
this
hypothetical?
supposing
in
this...
the
facts
of
this
very
case,
the
government
had
brought
four
different
cce
charges,
one
involving
the
sale
of
brown
heroin
from
1984
to
1990,
the
second
involving
the
sale
of
white
heroin
in
1988,
and
the
third
involving
the
sale
of
cooked
cocaine
in
november
of
1993...
three
separate...
and
then
the
fourth,
charging
the
whole
bunch.
under
your
view,
if
i
understand
it,
the
defendant
could
be
found
not
guilty
on
all
of
the
three
charges
but
guilty
on
the
fourth.
unknown
speaker
well,
each
is
a
continuing
criminal
enterprise.
the
first
involves
brown
heroin
from
1984
to
1990.
the
second
involves
white
heroin
in
1990,
and
the
third
involves
cooked
cocaine--
unknown
speaker
--and
then
there's
one
overriding.
unknown
speaker
and
they
could
be...
and
they
charge
all
four.
unknown
speaker
the
jury
could
be
not
convinced
on
any
one
of
the
first
three,
but
enough...
you
get
a
combination
to
convict
on
the
fourth,
and
that
would
be
okay.
unknown
speaker
that
is
consistent
with
your
theory.
unknown
speaker
well,
except
you
have
one
witness
on
each
of
them
and
six
of
them
think
this
guy
is
unbelievable
and
six
think
the
other
guy
is...
so,
i
don't
think
that's
so
totally
impossible.
unknown
speaker
those
are
all
means
and
manners,
but
why
can't
we
adopt
the
rule
that
where
an
element
of
the
statute
requires
the
commission
of
a
crime,
you
need
to
have...
or
a
series
of
crimes,
you
need
to
have
12
tried
and
true
jurors
find
that
in
fact
a
crime
was
committed?
unknown
speaker
once
you
say
that
an
element
of
it
is
a
crime,
a
whole
crime,
not
just
intent,
not
just
any
of
the
manners
or
means,
but
a
completed
crime,
once
the
government
wants
to
get
somebody
and
impose
an
additional
penalty
for
a
crime,
whether
it's
an
individual
crime
or
a
series
of
crimes,
you
need
12
people
to
say
there
was
a
crime
here,
here,
and
here.
what...
what
would
that
destroy?
unknown
speaker
what
classic
statutes
would
that
harm
that--
unknown
speaker
--we're
exactly
answering
whether
we
should
let
these
modern
statutes
proceed.
it's
bank
robbery.
whoever
by
physical...
you
know,
what
is
it?
assault
or...
or
intimidation,
i
mean,
extortion.
i
don't
know.
i
guess
you
could
charge
under
bank
robbery
he
either
did
it
through
extortion--
unknown
speaker
--or
you
could
say
he
did
it
through
assault,
which
is
a
crime,
and
some
of
the
people
say
it
was
assault
and
some
of
the
people
think
it's
extortion.
i
mean,
sending
somebody
a
note,
give
me
the
money
or
your
life,
is...
i
would
worry
that
there
are
lots
of
classical
statutes
that
would
be
affected
by
that.
well,
and
i
suppose
one
could
get...
get
around
the
rule
that
justice
scalia
proposes,
if
it
were
ever
adopted,
by...
you
know,
congress
comes
in
and
says,
well,
we're
not
talking
about
crimes
here.
we're
talking
about
something
called
drug
transactions.
and
they're
not
separately
criminal,
but
if
you
combine
them
in
such
a
way,
then
they
are
criminal.
unknown
speaker
how
do
you--
--the
answer...
no,
please
go
ahead.
the
answer
may
be,
as
i
think
justice
scalia
suggested
a
second
ago
in...
in
preface
to
his
question,
schad
assumed
that
there
was
in...
it
was
possible
in
the
analysis
to
make
a
distinction
between
means
and
ends.
the
end
in
schad
was...
was
the
killing.
one
of
the
means
by
which
that
killing,
in
effect,
was
accomplished
was...
was...
was
what
we
tend
to
call
the
mental
element.
and
historically
we
have
said
the
mental
element
can
be
proven
either
as,
you
know,
the
factual
element...
he
deliberated...
or
the
mental
element
can
be
satisfied
by
proving
that
he
was
committing
another
offense
when
the
killing
occurred,
i.e.,
in
schad's
case,
robbery.
there
was
a
means/ends
distinction.
the
trouble
with
applying
schad
here
is
that
i
don't
think
we're
talking
about
the
same
kind
of
means/ends
distinction
because
what
we're
talking
about
here
is
an
entirely
separate
element
that
does
not
go
to
the
end
of
proving
the
one
crime
which...
which
brought
us
into
court.
the
particular
transaction,
which
was
the
transaction
principally
charged
here,
was
not
committed
by
this
other
series.
it
was
committed,
whether
he
committed
three
other
offenses
or
didn't
commit
three
other
offenses.
and
so,
we
don't
have
the
same
kind
of
means/ends
distinction
possible
here
that
we
had
in
schad.
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
you...
you
apply...
well,
that's
right.
but
what
you're
doing
is
saying,
there
are
different
means
of
proving
the
series,
this
three,
that
three,
a
third
three,
and
so
on.
but
the
relationship
between
the
series
and
the
principal
crime
charged
here,
i.e.,
this
particular
transaction
that
brought
us
into
court,
is
not
the
same
as
it
was
in
schad.
so,
query
whether...
whether...
whether
schad
should
open
the
door
to
proving
an
element
which
is
not
itself
a
means
to
the...
to
the
commission
of
the
principal
crime
in
the
same
manner
that
schad
would
allow
if
it
were
an
element
going
to
the
means
of
proving--
unknown
speaker
--well,
should
rationality
include...
include
whether
it...
it
simply
deprives
the
jury
of
its
historic
function?
i
mean,
any
crime
could
now
be...
you...
you
could
dispense
with
the
unanimity
requirement
of
the
jury
by
charging...
enacting
new
statutes
for
a
series
of
burglaries,
for
a
series
of
robberies,
for
a
series
of
rapes,
and
the
defendant
would
be...
would
be
held
before
the
court
and...
and...
and
all
you
would
need
is
a...
is
a
minority
of
the
jury
to
believe
that
one
or
another
rape
occurred,
a
robbery
occurred,
or
burglary
occurred.
and
that's
just
so
contrary
to
what
our
tradition
has
been.
unknown
speaker
is
that...
is
that
an
irrational
definition?
unknown
speaker
what
if
a
defendant
is
charged
with
speeding
on
the...
on
or
about
such
and
such
a
date
at
the
intersection
of
15th
and
pennsylvania
avenue?
and
after
the
evidence,
six
of
the
jury
say
he
was
really
speeding
when
he
was
on
pennsylvania
avenue,
but
not
when
he
turned
into
15th,
and
the
other
part
of
the
jury
says,
well,
he
wasn't
really
speeding
when
he
was
on
pennsylvania.
it
was
after
he
turned
onto
15th.
do
you
think
that
that
jury
can
properly
return
a
verdict
of
guilty
on
that
charge?
unknown
speaker
what
about
the
hobbs
act
or
the
travel
act?
i
mean,
suppose
that
you
have
a
person
traveling
in
interstate
commerce
intending
to
distribute
the
proceeds
of
an
unlawful
activity.
six
jurors
think
that
the
unlawful
activity
was
robbing
a
bank;
six
jurors
think
that,
on
a
totally
different
day,
the
unlawful
activity
was
selling
a
lottery
ticket
without
permission.
in
other
words,
is
this
going
to
apply
to
the
travel
act?
and
then
you
look
at
the
hobbs
act
with
extortion.
six
jurors
think
that
he
took
a
bribe
with
a
traffic
ticket
and
thereby
extorted
under
color
of
official
right,
and
six
jurors
think
that
what
he
did
was
rob
a
bank
pretending
to
be
a
policeman
with
the
right
to
go
into
a
vault.
i
mean,
does
this
apply
across
the
board?
the
travel
act,
the
hobbs
act,
all
the
illegal
gambling
statutes?
i
didn't
think
it
did,
to
tell
you
the
truth,
and
i
was
trying
to
figure
out
what
the
theory
would
be
to
distinguish
the
ones
from
the
other.
unknown
speaker
well,
that
defines--
unknown
speaker
--no,
no,
but
that
isn't
the
problem.
unknown
speaker
here's
it's
not
this?
unknown
speaker
it's
not
that
in
the
hobbs
act.
it's
not
that
in
the
travel
act.
look
at
the
money
laundering
statutes.
six
people
think
that
this
money
laundering
came
from...
from
a
copyright
violation.
that's
one
of
them
under
the...
six
of
them
think
that
the
money
came
from
a
big
dope
ring.
does
it
matter?
i'm
not
asking
because
i
have
a
view.
i'm
asking
you--
unknown
speaker
--no,
no.
unknown
speaker
it's
not.
we
know
what
the
hobbs
act
says.
we
know
what
the
travel
act
says.
unknown
speaker
well,
we
all
know
that...
i
mean,
the
travel
act
says
whoever
travels
in
interstate
commerce
with
intent
to
distribute
the
proceeds
of
any
unlawful
activity.
that's
it.
unknown
speaker
now...
now,
six
people
think--
unknown
speaker
--so,
basically
you're...
you're
saying
across
the
board--
unknown
speaker
--well,
but
to
think
of
the
hobbs
act,
the
hobbs
act...
the
crime
is
affecting
interstate
commerce.
and
one
person
thinks
affecting
interstate
commerce
through,
for
example,
extortion
defined
as
extorting
money
under
official
right.
all
right?
now,
they
all
think
he
affected
interstate
commerce.
that's
awfully
broad.
and
six
people
think
he
affected
interstate
commerce
by
pretending
to
be
a
policeman
and
robbing
a
bank
or
being
a
policeman
and
going
in
and
robbing
a
bank,
getting
in
that
way,
and
six
people
think
what
he
did
was
take
a
bribe
from
somebody
he
stopped
to
get
a
traffic
ticket.
now,
what
about--
unknown
speaker
--by
the
way,
they're
totally
different
days
and--
unknown
speaker
--all
right.
now,
my
problem
is
suppose
that
i
think
with
the
hobbs
act,
anyway,
that's
just
too
broad
because
all
you
have
as
the
common
thing
is
you
affected
interstate
commerce.
now,
if
i
go
down
that
track,
i
have
to
draw
a
line
and
i
don't
know
how
to
draw
the
line.
you're
telling
me
don't
go
down
it.
but,
my
goodness,
if
i
don't
go
down
it,
look
what
happens.
unknown
speaker
you
didn't
charge
conspiracy
as
the
predicate
act.
unknown
speaker
well,
but
you're
saying
that
this
is
a--
--the
conspiracy,
any
particular
conspiracy?
as
i
understand
your
case,
they
could
have
all
had
different...
the
different
jurors
could
have
different
conspiracies
in
mind.
unknown
speaker
well,
but
there
could
have
been
a
lot
of
other...
i
mean,
there
could
have
been--
unknown
speaker
--but
that's
probably
accidental.
i
mean--
unknown
speaker
--but
the
government...
but
the
government
could
charge
these
cases
by
saying,
you
know,
it
could
have
been
this
conspiracy,
it
could
have...
you
could
have
conspired
with
these
eight
people
or
maybe
it's
these
eight
people
or
maybe
it's
these
eight
people.
and
it's
up
to
the
jury
if...
if
you
get
four
for
each,
you
have
a
conviction
on
the
conspiracy
count
as
well.
right?
unknown
speaker
it
seems
to
me
the
direction
you're
going
in
now
is
to
say
that
this
is
like
a
traditional
conspiracy,
and
you're
attempting
to
answer
the
problem
raised
earlier
when
we
said
that
this
is
a
modern
sort
of
crime
that's
troubling.
and
so,
you
say,
well,
it's
like...
enough
like
a
conspiracy
that
we
shouldn't
have
to
worry
too
much.
is
that
about
where
the
argument
is
going?
unknown
speaker
but
rationally
may
not
be
the
happiest
adverb
there
because
rationally
suggests
there
has
to
be
a
connection
between
means
and
ends.
and
if
congress'
end
is
to,
you
know,
catch
as
many
of
these
people
as
possible
and
send
them
to
prison,
then
they're
probably
going
to
define
the
thing
in
such
a
way
that
the...
a
hung
jury
is
not
much
of
a
threat
to
them.
i
think
you...
you've
got
to
spell
out
a
little
bit
more
why
this
was
a
permissible--
unknown
speaker
--mr.
gornstein,
what's
new
about
this
problem?
i
mean,
habitual
drug
dealers
may
be
new,
but
there
were
habitual
pick-pockets.
there
were
habitual
bank
robbers.
there's
no
reason
why
statutes
like
this
couldn't
have
been
enacted
in
the
past.
but
it's
part
of
our
anglo-saxon
legal
tradition
that
we
didn't
have
statutes
like
this.
we
didn't
put
somebody
in
jail
for
being
a
traditional...
an
habitual
speeder
and
then
having
the
jury
decide
whether
he
might
have
speeded
on
any
of
10
different
days.
we
habitually
have
not
done
this.

mr.
gornstein,
it
just
occurred
to
me,
when
you
talked
about
multiple
conspiracies,
in
the
kantiakis
case,
the
court
held
you
can't
just
find
a
whole
bunch
of
conspiracies
if
you
charge
one.
i
really
think
your
position
may
be
inconsistent
with
the...
with
that
ancient
case.
unknown
speaker
the
kantiakis
case.
unknown
speaker
there
are
a
whole
bunch
of
them
there,
and
you
say,
well,
that's
not
good
enough
to
satisfy
the
one
conspiracy
charge.
unknown
speaker
it's
not
a
hypothetical.
it's
328
u.s.--
unknown
speaker
--well,
your
position
that
you
can
sort
of
lump
everything
together,
and
that's
just
as
good
as...
i
mean,
even
though
each
juror
thinks
it's
one
separate
part
of
the
whole,
as
long
as
they
all
come
out
with
the
same
conclusion,
that's
enough.
unknown
speaker
no.
they
have
to
agree
it's
the
same
conspiracy.
unknown
speaker
and
here
you
don't
have
to
agree
it's
the
same
series
of
violations.
unknown
speaker
well,
maybe
what
you're
suggesting
to
us
is
that
we
ought
to
decide
how
far
the
means/ends
distinction
can
be
applied
by
asking
how
much
more
difficult,
if
at
all,
it...
it
makes
the...
it
makes
it
for
the
defendant
to
prepare
for
trial.
and
you're
saying,
well,
this
isn't
making
it
any
tougher
than
it
is
to
defend
a
conspiracy
case.
unknown
speaker
so,
is
the...
is
the
implicit
criterion
that
the
limiting
principle
on
what
is
possible
under
the
means/end
schad
distinction
is
a
different
principle,
and
that
is,
how
tough
is
it
making
it
for
the
defendant
to...
to
prepare
to...
to
defend
himself?
unknown
speaker
well,
maybe
it
should
have.
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
that
isn't
the
only
objection.
i
mean,
he's
not
concerned
just
about
the
preparation.
he's
also
concerned
that
his
client
is
entitled
to
12...
to
12
votes
instead
of
just
6.
unknown
speaker
the
modern
problem
is
oliver
twist,
murder,
incorporated.
i
mean,
there
have
been
continuing
criminal
enterprises
i
guess
since
the
beginning
of
time.
unknown
speaker
the
ones
that
exist
in
our
time
always
seem
worse,
of
course.
i
mean,
i'm
not
worried
about
oliver...
about...
about
fagin
anymore,
but--
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
the
honorable
court
is
now
adjourned
until
tomorrow
at
ten
o'clock.
