mr.
william
a.
barnett,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
fifth
and
sixth
amendments
to
the
united
states
constitution
require
that
a
jury
in
a
federal
criminal
case
unanimously
agree
as
to
each
fact
which
is
necessary
to
constitute
an
offense.
the
jury
is
a
finder
of
fact.
the
prosecutor's
decision
in
the
case--
mr.
william
a.
barnett,
jr.
--pardon
me,
your
honor?
mr.
william
a.
barnett,
jr.
winship.
the
prosecutor's
decision
to
charge
in
this
case--
mr.
william
a.
barnett,
jr.
--well,
the--
mr.
william
a.
barnett,
jr.
--the
question
i
guess
is
what
is
the
bottom
line,
and
the
bottom
line
in--
mr.
william
a.
barnett,
jr.
--yes,
but
the
offense
is
defined.
and
with
respect
to
the
definition
of
the
offense,
there
are
certain
constituent
facts
which
the
jury,
as
the
finder
of
fact,
is
required
to
find
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
in
the
continuing
criminal
enterprise
statute,
those
constituent
facts
are
that
the
primary
elements
are
that
the
defendant
be...
have
committed
a
crime
which
is
a
felony
under
the
federal
narcotics
statutes--
mr.
william
a.
barnett,
jr.
--well,
if
you
cannot
pin
it
down--
mr.
william
a.
barnett,
jr.
--congress--
mr.
william
a.
barnett,
jr.
--well,
you're
correct,
your
honor.
in
the
rico
statute,
it
specifically
states
that
there
have
to
be
at
least
two
and
that
they
have
to
fall
within
a
certain
time
period
with
relationship
to
each
other.
mr.
william
a.
barnett,
jr.
on
the
other
hand,
just
because
congress
called
it
a
series
of
violations,
in
this
case
instead
of
defining
it
as
three
or
more
violations
or
some
other
specific
definition,
nevertheless,
the
word
series
is
a
conclusion.
it's
a
conclusory
statement
of
fact.
the
word
series
means
nothing
without
a
context,
without
an
object
of
the
preposition.
what
is
it
a
series
of?
and
they
have
defined
that
specifically
in
the
continuing
criminal
enterprise
statute
as
violations
of
the
federal
narcotics
laws.
those
violations
are
very
specifically
defined
throughout
the...
the
statutory
framework,
each
and
every
one,
and
each
and
every
one
has
well
defined
elements
which
have
been
defined
and
judicially
interpreted
over
the
years.
to
suggest
that
the
congress,
by
using
the
word
series
of
violations,
suggested
that
the
jury
did
not
have
to
focus
in
on
what
it
is
that
the
series
was
comprised
of--
mr.
william
a.
barnett,
jr.
--well,
a
series
is
made
up
of
the
constituent
elements.
so,
in
order
to
find
a
series,
you
would
have
to
find
that
they...
and
it
then
occurred
at
one
time,
a
second
time,
a
third
time,
a
fourth
time--
mr.
william
a.
barnett,
jr.
--that's
correct,
judge.
this
is
not
a
sufficiency
of
the
evidence
case.
mr.
william
a.
barnett,
jr.
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
william
a.
barnett,
jr.
i'm
not...
i'm
not
suggesting
there's
a
defect
in
the
statute
at
all.
mr.
william
a.
barnett,
jr.
i'm
not
suggesting
there
was
a
defect
in
the
proof
here.
this
is
not
a
case
about
the
proof.
it's
a
question
as
to
whether
or
not
the
jury
was
properly
instructed
that
it
had
to
unanimously
find
that
each
of
the
elements
had
been--
mr.
william
a.
barnett,
jr.
--insofar
as
it
is
implicitly
included
in
the
series,
yes,
i
am.
i
know
that
the
government
has
taken
the
position
that
that
issue
has
been
waived.
on
the
other
hand,
by
our
request
for
an
instruction
that
the
jury
find
with
respect
to
the
series,
defined
as
at
least
three,
that
it
find
unanimously
that
each
of
the
three
has
been
proved,
i
would
suggest
that
we
preserve
that
issue.
and
the
instruction
given
by
the
court
to
the
effect
that
it
need
not...
the
jury
need
not
find
unanimously
with
respect
to
any
of
the
underlying
predicate
offenses
in
the
event
that...
well,
in
effect,
told
them
they
wouldn't
have
to
agree
with
respect
to
that
first
offense.
and
that
was...
at
least
i'm
arguing
here
today
that
was
legally
wrong
and
violative
of
the
constitution.
mr.
william
a.
barnett,
jr.
the
due
process
clause
requires
sufficient
specificity
so
that
a
man
understands
what
it
is
he's
charged
with.
mr.
william
a.
barnett,
jr.
yes,
but
during
the
course
of
the
trial,
a
man
must
be
able
to
meet
the
charges
that
are
being
made
against
a
man.
when
it
is
set
forth
in
a
scattershot
fashion
so
that
he's,
in
effect,
asked
to
hit
a
moving
target
in...
in
cross-examining
witnesses
as
to
specific
events
when
they
don't
give
testimony
with
respect
to
specific
events
and
it's
a
generic
type
of
testimony,
then
it
puts
him
in
an
untenable
position...
excuse
me.
mr.
william
a.
barnett,
jr.
yes,
i
do,
judge,
and
the
reason
for
that
is
because
if
they
do
not
agree...
if
you
cannot
get
the
jurors
to
agree
unanimously
as
to
any
one
of
those
elements,
you
have
to
drop
it
out.
so,
if
you
have
six,
but
you
can
only
get
unanimous
agreement
on
two,
for
instance,
you
haven't
proved
a
series
of
six.
mr.
william
a.
barnett,
jr.
but--
mr.
william
a.
barnett,
jr.
--well,
with
respect
to
that
series
of
thousands
that
he's
talking
about,
the
testimony
that
came
in
was
from
essentially
three
witnesses--
mr.
william
a.
barnett,
jr.
--the
way
it
was
charged
was
as
a...
a
conspiracy,
and
off
the
top
of
my
head,
i
can't
remember
if
they
said
this
involved
thousands
of
transactions.
but
you
can
certainly
make
the...
the
inferential
jump
from
the
terms
of
the
indictment
and
the
way
the
conspiracy
was
described
to...
to
conclude
that,
yes,
this
was
a
case
involving
thousands
of
transactions.
mr.
william
a.
barnett,
jr.
well,
the--
mr.
william
a.
barnett,
jr.
--no.
mr.
william
a.
barnett,
jr.
and
they--
mr.
william
a.
barnett,
jr.
--that's
true.
mr.
william
a.
barnett,
jr.
they
also
could
have
charged
predicate
acts
as
substantive
crimes,
which
they
chose
not
to
do,
which
interestingly,
the...
the
rico
statute,
which
has
been
referred
to
here...
routinely
the
government
charges
the
predicate
acts
as
substantive
crimes.
and
the
convictions
on
those
underlying
substantive
crimes
become
the
basis
for
finding
the
predicate
in
the
rico
charge.
but
in
this
statute,
the
government
has
taken
the
position
that
because
the
word
series
of
violations
is
not
as
specific
as
in
rico,
they
don't
even
have
to
charge
any
predicate
offenses.
and...
and
i'm
not
quarreling
with
that.
the
case
law
is
clear
that
they
do
not,
but
if
they
do
not,
they
should
at
least
be
required
to
point
to
three
offenses
and
say,
you've
got
a
series.
if
you
can
agree
on
the
three
offenses,
and
particularly
one
within
the
statute
of
limitations,
then
you've
got
a
series--
mr.
william
a.
barnett,
jr.
--the
five-person
requirement,
as
i
view
the
statute,
is
significantly
different
from
the
underlying
offenses.
the...
the
basic
criminality
of
the
continuing
criminal
enterprise
statute
is
contained
within
the
fact
that
there
are
narcotics
violations
which
have
occurred.
there
is
nothing
else
in
the
statute
that's
criminal.
hanging
around
with
five
other
people
or
making
a
lot
of
money
is
not
criminal
in
and
of
itself.
those...
and
in
the
structure
of
the
statute,
those
are
subsidiary
to
the
primary
element
that
the
violation
be
part
of
a
continuing
series.
they
are--
mr.
william
a.
barnett,
jr.
--no.
mr.
william
a.
barnett,
jr.
you
can
file
a
motion
for
a
bill
of
particulars.
mr.
william
a.
barnett,
jr.
well,
the
notice
problem
comes
in
when
you
have
thousands
of
transactions
because
you,
in
effect,
have
to
defend
against
something
having
occurred
on
any
one--
mr.
william
a.
barnett,
jr.
--well,
in
that
event...
well,
let
me
back
up
a
second.
mr.
william
a.
barnett,
jr.
but
even
a
bill
of
particulars
wouldn't
have
done
any
good
in
this
case
if
they
gave
us
a
list
of
thousands
of
offenses
and
didn't
say
these
are
the
three
that
we're
talking
about.
the
question--
mr.
william
a.
barnett,
jr.
--well,
yes,
that's
true.
mr.
william
a.
barnett,
jr.
that's
correct.
mr.
william
a.
barnett,
jr.
well,
instead
of...
well,
i
think
that
it's
fair
to,
instead
of
allowing
the
government
to
take
a
scattershot
approach,
when
the
ultimate
argument
they
are
going
to
make
to
the
jury
is
that
you
don't
have
to
look
at
anything
in
particular
here,
you
just
have
to
take
a
look
at
the
thousands
of
offenses
and
come
to
a
sense
as
opposed
to
a
finding
of
fact
that
something
has
occurred
on
such
and
such
day
three
times
in
a
row,
but
instead
have
a
sense
that
this
is
a
bad
man,
that...
that
this
activity
is
going
on,
but
without
pointing
to
the
specifics.
because
if
you
don't
have
an
agreement
on
a
specific...
if
you
don't
have
an
agreement
on
enough
specifics
to
make
a
series,
then
you
don't
have
agreement
on
a
series.
the
series
is--
mr.
william
a.
barnett,
jr.
--are
you
referring
to
my
argument
in
the
court?
mr.
william
a.
barnett,
jr.
in
the
district
court?
mr.
william
a.
barnett,
jr.
the
instruction
that
we
requested
was--
mr.
william
a.
barnett,
jr.
--well,
the
way
it
was
phrased
was
that...
it
wasn't
quite
that
specific
or
well
thought
out--
mr.
william
a.
barnett,
jr.
--i
have
to
say.
it's
you
must
unanimously
agree
on
which
three
acts
constituted
the
series
of
violations.
and
that
was
as
specific
as
we
got
in
our
requested
instruction.
the
court's
instruction
was
that
the...
the
jury
need
not
have...
you
do
not,
however,
have
to
agree
as
to
the
particular
three
or
more
federal
narcotics
offenses
committed
by
the
defendant.
mr.
william
a.
barnett,
jr.
oh.
you
must
unanimously
agree
that
the
defendant
committed
at
least
three
federal
narcotics
offenses.
you
do
not,
however,
have
to
agree
as
to
the
particular
three
or
more
federal
narcotics
offenses.
mr.
william
a.
barnett,
jr.
i
think
that
logic--
mr.
william
a.
barnett,
jr.
--oh,
no,
i
certainly
don't.
mr.
william
a.
barnett,
jr.
and
i
think
that
logically
follows
from
what
the
government's
position
is.
mr.
william
a.
barnett,
jr.
yes.
it's
very--
mr.
william
a.
barnett,
jr.
--well,
the...
there's
a
difference
between
the
characterization
and
the
act,
the
legal
characterization
of
what
the
criminal
act
which
has
occurred
is,
and
whether
the
jury
can
distinguish
between
two
different
legal
characterizations
of
the
same
actus
reus
may
lend
itself
to
this
morally
equivalence
analysis
which
is
set
forth
in
schad.
if
they're
morally
equivalent,
does
it
make
any
difference
whether
it's
taking
by
force
or
taking
by
intimidation?
we
think
not.
therefore,
the
jury
just
has
to
unanimously
agree,
but
they
are
unanimously
agreeing
on
a
particular
set
of
facts,
an
actus
reus,
an
act
by
the
defendant
which
has
a
particular
victim,
and
with
respect
to
that,
they
are
finding
the
guilt.
mr.
william
a.
barnett,
jr.
well,
as
in
schad,
the...
the...
the
same...
well,
that
was
the
case
in
schad,
although
it
was
a
state
court
case.
but
that...
once
again,
that
is
not
a
question
as
to
whether
a
particular
actus
reus
has
occurred.
that's
a--
mr.
william
a.
barnett,
jr.
--the...
the
criminal
act,
the
specific
set
of--
mr.
william
a.
barnett,
jr.
--yes,
what
he
did.
that
has
to
do
with
what
he
was
thinking
when
he
did
it.
and
the
analysis
in
schad
pretty
much
extrapolated
from
the
moral
equivalence
argument
which
applies...
what
i
would
say
applies
to
the
legal
characterization
of
the
act,
would
also
apply
to
a
certain
extent
to
the
mens
rea
involved,
which...
which
is
what
was
suggested
in
schad
and
what...
what
this
court
found.
but
in
this
case,
we're
talking
about
the
other
hypothetical
posed
by
justice
scalia,
which
is
can
you
indict
a
man
and
convict
him
for
either
assaulting
mr.
x
on
tuesday
or
mr.
y
on
thursday?
just...
the
jurors
may
unanimously--
mr.
william
a.
barnett,
jr.
--there's
a...
there's
a
difference
between
the
jurors
unanimously
agreeing
that
a...
a
crime
has
occurred
on
such
and
such
a
date
and...
and
the
jurors
unanimously
calling
something
that
happens
a
crime.
now,
12
jurors
can
each
think
to
themselves
a
man
has
done,
let's
call
it,
a
crime
and
one
because
he
thinks
he
committed
a
murder,
one
because
he
thinks
he
committed
a
robbery,
one
because
he
thinks
he
committed
a
rape.
and
they
don't
unanimously
agree
that
he
did
any
of
those
things,
but
each
one
of
them
says
this
man
committed
a
crime
and
they're
unanimous
on
that.
that
is
not
unanimous
agreement
on
a
specific
crime
with
which
this
man
is
charged.
mr.
william
a.
barnett,
jr.
well,
when
you
say
they
don't
disagree,
your
honor,
i
think--
mr.
william
a.
barnett,
jr.
--no,
i
would
not
say
that's
a
mode.
that's
the
essence
of
the
transaction,
what
transactions
have
occurred.
and
do
you
have
12
people
unanimously
agreeing
that
the
transactions
have
occurred,
or
do
you
have
12
people
agreeing
that
transactions
occurred
and
we're
all
willing
to
call
whatever
transactions
we
think
occurred
a
series?
mr.
william
a.
barnett,
jr.
yes,
i
do.
mr.
william
a.
barnett,
jr.
no,
you
don't
misunderstand
my
argument,
but
i...
i
think
that
with
respect
to
that
distinction
between
the
mental
state
required
to
commit
a
first
degree
murder
and
that
required
to
commit
a
felony
murder
and
the
fact
that
the
crime
which
has
occurred
is
a
murder...
there
has
been
a
man
killed...
takes
it
out
of
the
situation
where
we
don't
know
whether
the
jury
agrees
that
the
transaction
occurs
on
tuesday
or
the
transaction
occurs
on
thursday.
mr.
william
a.
barnett,
jr.
that's
correct,
but
with
respect
to
the
thought
process/robbery
dichotomy,
the
moral
equivalence
test
suggests
that
it
doesn't
matter
which
one
they
agree
on.
mr.
william
a.
barnett,
jr.
oh,
i
don't
think
it--
mr.
william
a.
barnett,
jr.
--well,
schad
is
distinguishable
in
many
respects,
but
i...
i
would
say
that
under
the
circumstances
of
that
case,
that
the
court
came
to
that
conclusion
premised
upon
its
look
at
the
historical
way
a
felony
murder
was
treated
like
capital
murder,
and
that
that
analogy
does
not
affect
the
analysis
in
this
case--
mr.
william
a.
barnett,
jr.
--that
is
a
very
strong
part
of
the...
the
argument.
mr.
william
a.
barnett,
jr.
well,
i
don't
think
we
have
a
case
here
where
you
have
children
that...
that
cannot
discriminate
between
dates
and
to
suggest--
mr.
william
a.
barnett,
jr.
--i'm
not
saying
they
can't
legislate
against
a
continuing
criminal
enterprise,
which
is
what
they
did
here.
what
i'm
saying
is
that
they
should
be...
the
government
should
be
subject
to
the
same
rules
of
proof
that
they
are
in
any
kind
of
a
case,
which
is
they've
got
a
fact
that
they
have
to
prove
and
they
bring
witnesses
in
who
can
testify
to
it.
and
i
think
that
to
take
the
position
that
their
witnesses
are...
that
they're
not
going
to
have
witnesses
that
are
competent
and
therefore
we
should
just
disregard
the
requirements
that
they
prove
a
case
would
be
contrary
to
the
fifth
amendment.
your
honor,
at
this
time,
if
i
have
any
time--
