mr.
daniel
g.
stone
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
district
court's
dismissal
of
this
section
5
coverage
case
was
quite
correct,
and
we
submit
that
it
should
be
affirmed
by
this
court.
the--
mr.
daniel
g.
stone
--it
was
raised
in
our
motion
to
dismiss
as
one
of
the
grounds
on
which
the
case
should
be
dismissed,
but
the
district
court
did
not
reach
it,
and
there
were
several
other
issues
as
well
that
the
court
found
it
unnecessary
to
reach.
mr.
daniel
g.
stone
oh,
i'm
sorry.
the
question
related
to
whether
laches
had
been
raised,
and
i
indicated
that
it
was
a
ground
in
our
motion
to
dismiss,
but
that
the
district
court
had
not
reached
it.
this
case
presents
a
situation
that
was
not
contemplated
by
section
5,
and
it's
a
situation
for
which
the
preclearance
requirement
provides
no
meaningful
remedy.
here,
if
the
appellants
are
correct,
then
the
practical
result
would
be
no
election
for
anybody
with
respect
to
municipal
court
judges
in
the
county
of
monterey
indefinitely.
the
district
court,
the
coverage
court,
could
enjoin
elections
under
the
current
system
to
be
sure,
but,
as
everyone
now
agrees,
the
county
has
no
authority,
no
remaining
authority
to
conduct
elections
pursuant
to
the
1968
status
quo
system,
and
the
county
has
no
authority,
as
justice
o'connor
pointed
out,
to
at
this
point
create
new
justice
court
districts,
to
merge
districts,
or
do
anything.
mr.
daniel
g.
stone
well,
we
suggest--
mr.
daniel
g.
stone
--we
suggest
that
the
district
court
cannot
in
a
coverage
case
suspend
the
constitution
of
a
noncovered
jurisdiction,
that
its
remedial
power
necessarily,
even
if
we're
talking
about
the
washington,
d.c.
district
court
upon
a
finding
of--
mr.
daniel
g.
stone
--correct.
mr.
daniel
g.
stone
well,
your
question
suggested
a
host
of
answers,
but
initially
we
now
have
from
the
united
states
government
as
amicus
a
concession
that
noncovered
jurisdictions
have
no
obligation
to
preclear
anything.
the
state
of
california
is
permitted,
they
say,
as--
mr.
daniel
g.
stone
--correct.
mr.
daniel
g.
stone
well,
under
the
united
states'
theory
it
is
required
to
seek
preclearance,
not--
mr.
daniel
g.
stone
--only
of
its
own
ordinances
but
of
a
state
enactment.
mr.
daniel
g.
stone
or
in
this
case
a
state
constitutional
amendment--
mr.
daniel
g.
stone
--that
it
did
not
initiate
it,
it
has
no
authority
to
initiate
it,
and
it
can't
change--
mr.
daniel
g.
stone
--well,
if
california
itself,
the
state,
as
a
noncovered
jurisdiction
has
no
obligation
to
preclear
its
enactments,
and
it
does
not
by
concession
at
this
point,
then
how
can
the
state--
mr.
daniel
g.
stone
--i'm
sorry,
your
honor.
mr.
daniel
g.
stone
well,
i
suppose
so,
but
then
what
does
that
do
to
its
sovereignty?
mr.
daniel
g.
stone
it
did,
and
it
has
on
and
off
over
history.
certainly
we
concede
that
a
number
of
states
in
the
position
of
california
that
are
not
themselves
covered
but
that
have
covered
subdivisions
have,
for
whatever
reasons,
and
i
suspect
they
were
often
political
reasons,
attempts
to
reassure
before
enacting,
perhaps
to
guarantee
themselves
that
they
wouldn't
be
subject
to
section
2
or
constitutional
lawsuits,
they
have
willingly
attempted
to
preclear
through
the
u.s.
department
of
justice.
mr.
daniel
g.
stone
well,
the
district
court
indicated
that
the
combination
of
the
preclearance
of
the
state's
1983
statute
and
of
the
county's
final
ordinance
merging
the
last
remaining
justice
courts
into
the
municipal
court,
which
was
also
precleared,
that
that
combination
put
an
end
absolutely
to
anything
other
than
a
county-wide
municipal
court.
now,
i
recognize
that
appellants
have
raised
arguments
that
because
the
county
was
the
acting
agent
in
bringing
those
last
two
justice
courts
into
the
municipal
court,
that
there
was
still
some
preclearance
requirement.
the
district
court
found
there
was
not.
but
that
was
all
rendered
moot
when
in
1994
the
people
of
the
state
of
california
eliminated
state-wide,
as
justice
scalia
pointed
out,
any
justice
courts.
there
are
no
longer
justice
courts.
the
state
of
california,
a
sovereign,
uncovered
state,
is
reforming
a
central
component
of
its
state
government.
it's
changing
the
nature
of
the
judiciary
in
the
state
by
eliminating--
mr.
daniel
g.
stone
--well,
in
this
court's
prior
lopez
opinion
in
1996
it
pointed
out
that
in
the
state
constitutional
framework
justice
courts
are
for
jurisdiction
of
less
than
40,000,
and
municipal
courts
are
for
more
than
40,000,
and
the
requirement
that
a
municipal
court
district
have
more
than
40,000
state
residents
within
it
remains
after
proposition
191,
so
that
a
small
justice
court
cannot
become,
in
and
of
itself,
a
separate
municipal
court.
mr.
daniel
g.
stone
well,
it
doesn't
add
anything
except--
mr.
daniel
g.
stone
--if
one
hypothesizes
that
had
the
county
not
willingly
merged
these
last
remaining
justice
courts,
then,
as
the
district
court
found,
by
operation
of
law,
once
justice
courts
were
eliminated,
the
last
two...
had
they
still
remained
justice
courts
in
monterey
county,
they
would
automatically
have
been
folded
into
the
existing--
mr.
daniel
g.
stone
--well,
it's
not
a
thing
they
can
have,
we
submit,
because
the
current
district
is
defined
by
state
law,
and
the
state
is
not
a
covered
jurisdiction.
mr.
daniel
g.
stone
well--
mr.
daniel
g.
stone
--that
is
the
question,
and--
mr.
daniel
g.
stone
--no,
you're
absolutely
correct,
if...
if
the--
mr.
daniel
g.
stone
--well,
except
that
one
has
to
define
the
federal
law
in
a
way
that
it
can
reach
and
annul
state
law.
mr.
daniel
g.
stone
correct.
the
question
is
the
plain
meaning
of
section
2,
and
we've
shown
the
court
in
our
briefs--
mr.
daniel
g.
stone
--your
hypothetical
would
involve
subdistricts
for
election
purposes?
mr.
daniel
g.
stone
well,
i'm
not
sure
what
the
answer
is
to
a
residential
requirement
if
there
were
county-wide
voting
for
those
people.
mr.
daniel
g.
stone
yes.
that
is
a
matter
of
the
state
constitution,
article
vi,
section
16.
mr.
daniel
g.
stone
yes.
as
to
all
judicial
districts,
every
voter
within
a
judicial
district
is
entitled
to
vote
for
every
judge
of
that
district.
mr.
daniel
g.
stone
correct,
and
for
that
there
are
not
county-wide
elections,
but
there
are
always
district-wide
elections.
as
i
understood
justice
stevens'
hypothetical,
we
had
a
county-wide
court
with
some
divisions
or
residency
requirements
within.
all
i'm
saying
is,
whatever
the
requirements
may
be,
there
would
still
have
to
be...
if
the
jurisdiction
of
the
municipal
court
district
were
county-wide,
then
every
voter
within
that
county
would
have
a
right
under
the
state
constitution
to
elect
the
judges
thereof.
mr.
daniel
g.
stone
it's
rather
a
combination.
in
june
of
this
year
the
state
constitution
was
amended
to
permit
what's
called
unification
of
municipal
and
superior
courts.
if
the
vote
taken
in
a
given
county
shows
a
majority
of
both
the
sitting
municipal
court
judges
and
the
sitting
superior
court
judges
in
favor
of
that
unification,
at
that
point
the
municipal
court
in
that
county
would
be
abolished,
and
apparently
that's
what
occurred
in
los
angeles
county.
mr.
daniel
g.
stone
there
was
not.
there
has
never
been--
mr.
daniel
g.
stone
--strictly
section
5.
mr.
daniel
g.
stone
it
could
include...
i
have
a
couple
of
answers,
but
in
the
section
5
framework,
in
the
coverage
case
as
opposed
to
an
action
for
declaratory
relief
in
the
washington,
d.c.
district
court--
mr.
daniel
g.
stone
--in
the
coverage
case,
all
the
coverage
court
can
do
is
determine
whether
the
challenged
change
is
in
fact--
mr.
daniel
g.
stone
--that's
correct.
if
the
petitioners
were...
if
the
county
were
required
to
go
to
washington,
d.c.
and
preclear,
or
attempt
to
preclear
its
ordinances,
it
would
be
an
utterly
futile
act
at
this
point
because
the
county
has
no
remaining
authority
to
implement
those
ordinances.
mr.
daniel
g.
stone
yes.
mr.
daniel
g.
stone
yes,
correct.
mr.
daniel
g.
stone
well--
mr.
daniel
g.
stone
--it's
certainly
an
alteration.
mr.
daniel
g.
stone
well,
as
justice
souter
pointed
out,
in
a
section
5
coverage
case,
one
of
the
issues
that
is
before
the
district
court
is
whether
the
voting
change,
the
alleged
voting
change
that
is
challenged,
is
in
fact
subject
to
preclearance
in
the
first
place.
mr.
daniel
g.
stone
precisely.
mr.
daniel
g.
stone
correct.
mr.
daniel
g.
stone
so
the
question
is
very
much
focused
on
the
plain
meaning
of
the
phrase,
seek
to
administer,
and
several
of
your
questions
to
the
appellant
said
so.
mr.
daniel
g.
stone
if
the
appellants'
interpretation
of
seek
to
administer,
which
is
that
it
encompasses
anything
and
everything,
regardless
of
source,
that
has
any
impact
within
the
covered
jurisdiction,
if
that
were,
that
very,
very
broad
interpretation
were
upheld
by
this
court,
then
it
would
be
a
direct
reversal
of
young
v.
fordice.
in
which
case,
as
you'll
recall,
in
mississippi
there
was
a
challenge
to
mississippi's
implementation
of
the
federal
national
voting
rights
act
which
very
much
changed
the
registration
practices
within
the
state,
which
is
a
covered
state,
and
this
court
said,
to
the
extent
that
there
is
no
discretion
in
the
covered
jurisdiction
to
make
any
changes
or
to
select
ways
in
which
to
implement
this,
it
doesn't
require
preclearance.
it
comes
from
a
noncovered
source.
it--
mr.
daniel
g.
stone
--no,
i
certainly
concede
that
we're
not
in
every
respect
in
the
same
shoes
as
the
federal
government,
but
it
seems
to
me
for
the
narrow
purposes
of
analyzing
what
seeks
to
administer
means
we
are
in
the
same
shoes,
in
the
sense
that
neither
the
state
of
california--
mr.
daniel
g.
stone
--over
which--
mr.
daniel
g.
stone
--but
the
covered
jurisdiction
likewise
has
no
choice
with
respect
to
california
law
when
that
law
does
not
reserve
any
discretion
within
the
covered
jurisdiction.
mr.
daniel
g.
stone
my
point
is
whether
the
covered
jurisdiction
is
exercising
any
kind
of
discretion.
recall
that
initially
section
5
was
designed
in
conjunction
with
section
4
to
identify...
through
a
statutory
formula
to
identify
those
jurisdictions,
and
they
were
either
states
or
political
subdivisions--
mr.
daniel
g.
stone
--well,
we--
mr.
daniel
g.
stone
--and
we
now
have
a
concession
from
the
appellants
that
the
term,
seeks
to
administer,
can
reasonably
be
used
to
speak
of
discretionary
administrative
acts
by
a
covered
jurisdiction.
this
is
in
their
reply
brief.
it's
the
fist
time
they've
said
this.
prior
to
this--
mr.
daniel
g.
stone
--well,
i
suggest
that
it
presents
the
court
with
an
ambiguity,
that
there
are
two
alternative
means
of
interpreting
seeks
to
administer
now.
as
plaintiffs
concede,
it
could
be
interpreted
to
focus
simply
on
the
administrative
acts
executive
decisions,
anything
other
than
the
formal
promulgations
by
a
covered
jurisdiction.
alternatively,
it
could
be
interpreted
to
be
broadly
to
encompass
anything
and
everything
that's
different,
whether
imposed
from
above
or
not,
and
because
there's
an
ambiguity--
mr.
daniel
g.
stone
--i
suppose,
but
i
suggest
that
that's
a
distinction
that
can't
be
found
anywhere
in
the
statute.
certainly
your
honor
could
suggest
it's
implied,
but
the
statute
talks
about
covered
versus
noncovered--
mr.
daniel
g.
stone
--yes.
mr.
daniel
g.
stone
well,
we
don't
admit
it's
a
loophole,
because
we
think
it's
fairly
strange--
mr.
daniel
g.
stone
--well,
it
is,
but
there
are,
i
don't
know,
what,
40-some-odd
noncovered
states
in
the
nation.
i
mean,
if
you
want
to
speak
of
loopholes,
obviously
the
section
5
preclearance
requirement
has
not
been
imposed
by
congress
upon
everyone.
mr.
daniel
g.
stone
well,
i...
that
would
require
speculation
on
my
part,
your
honor.
i
suggest
that
it
may
have
been
political
reasons,
to
show
good
faith
to
minority
voters
within
the
state,
to
try
to
avoid
perhaps
section
2
or
constitutional
challenges.
mr.
daniel
g.
stone
have
not
done
so?
mr.
daniel
g.
stone
i
can't
speak
to
that.
the
cases
deal
with
those
in
which
the
states
have
done
so
voluntarily.
mr.
daniel
g.
stone
well,
one
of
the
cases
here
is
the
1979
statute
in
california,
which
dictated
a
municipal
court
district
and
all
parties
concede
that
was
not
precleared.
the
state
did
not
seek
preclearance
of
that
and
i
suspect
there
are
a
number
of
other
examples.
i'm
just
not
aware
of
what
they
might
be.
mr.
daniel
g.
stone
no,
i
accept
the
united
states
representation
that
it's
commonplace
for
jurisdictions
in
this
situation
to
voluntarily
seek
preclearance,
but
i
don't
think
that
gets
us
anywhere
as
far
as
a
holding
of
this
court.
as
you
know,
all
the
shaw
cases
and
the
lawyer
case
from
florida
and
the
ujo
case
from
new
york
all
came
before
the
court
in
the
posture
of
a
constitutional
challenge,
or
a
section
2
challenge
to
redistricting
plans,
and
in
reciting
the
history
of
the
case
the
court
has
pointed
out
that
the
states,
north
carolina,
florida,
new
york,
voluntarily
sought
preclearance
administratively
before
finally
deciding
on
a
districting
plan.
but
there's
no
holding
that
analyzes,
as
this
court
is
now
asked
to
do,
what
the
plain
meaning
of
the
statute
is,
whether
there's
a
clear
statement
by
congress
that
this
section
5
is
intended
to
go
beyond
the
covered
jurisdictions,
and
what
the
federalism
issues
might
be
if
such
a--
mr.
daniel
g.
stone
--there
was
historically,
justice
breyer.
there...
government
code
section
71040
gave
to
the
counties
the
discretion
to
change
boundaries
as--
mr.
daniel
g.
stone
--no.
i
think
residence
requirement
is
a
state
requirement,
and--
mr.
daniel
g.
stone
--i
don't
know
the
answer
to
that.
maybe
they
could.
the
state
requirement
is
that
everyone
who
is
a
justice
of
that
court
reside
within
the
court,
so
if
you
wanted
to
parse
it
even
smaller
than
that,
perhaps
there
is
discretion.
i
don't
know.
mr.
daniel
g.
stone
it
could
be
either
way,
and
i'm
not
sure
precisely
in
the
case
of
los
angeles.
the
statute--
mr.
daniel
g.
stone
--yes.
yes.
there
is
statutory
discretion
given
to
the
counties
unless
the
state
acts
otherwise,
and
what's
happened
here
is
the
state
has
taken
over.
mr.
daniel
g.
stone
to
do--
mr.
daniel
g.
stone
--to
divide
into
subdivisions?
mr.
daniel
g.
stone
well,
i
submit
that
it
does,
not
only
because
in
1972
the
state
judicial
council
and
the
chief
justice
indicated
that
they
thought
that
was
the
better
way
for
monterey
county
to
operate,
but
also
because
much
more
recently
the
state
has
dictated
that
there
be
just
one
municipal
court
in
monterey
county.
so
the
state
policy
with
respect
to
this
part
of
its
overall
judicial
system
has
spoken,
and
has
dictated...
all
parties
are
agreed
here
that
the
county
no
longer
has
any
discretion
to
have
a
municipal
court
anything
short
of
county-wide.
so
my
point
is
that,
since
we
have
this
ambiguity,
then
under
the
cases
relating
to
importance
of
federalism,
the
gregory
v.
ashcroft,
the
new
york
v.
united
states,
will
v.
michigan,
they
say
that
if
there's
only
an
ambiguity,
if
the
most
that
the
plaintiffs
can
show
is
an
ambiguity,
then
that
falls
far
short
of
the
requisite
clear
statement--
mr.
daniel
g.
stone
--well,
it's...
with
respect
to
municipal
courts--
mr.
daniel
g.
stone
--the
statute
that
has
county-wide
municipal
court
in
monterey
county
is
county-specific.
there's
a
superior
court
system,
the
next
layer
up
and
the
one
which
can
now
be,
at
the
choice
of
the
counties,
unified
with
municipal
courts,
that's
always
been
county-wide
by
dictate
of
the
state.
mr.
daniel
g.
stone
the
problem
the
state
has
with
that
is
that
it
takes
the
presumption
which
attaches
with
application
of
section
5...
if
you're
a
covered
jurisdiction,
you're
presumed
to
have
had
a
history
of
wrongdoing,
and
you're
suspected
in
the
future
of
making
voting
changes
designed
to
undermine
the
voting
rights
of
minority
voters.
mr.
daniel
g.
stone
or
having
the
effect.
mr.
daniel
g.
stone
but
the
point
is--
mr.
daniel
g.
stone
--but
justice
scalia,
the
state
has
not
been
identified
as
a
wrongdoer.
the
preclearance
requirement
is
a
remedy
for
wrongdoing
identified
by
congress.
mr.
daniel
g.
stone
well,
the
policy
issue
goes
to
the
allocation
of
burdens.
if
you're
a
section
5
identified
covered
county,
then
it's
your
burden
to
go
to
washington,
d.c.
and
establish
that
your...
that
the
voting
change
that
you
desire
and
that
you
have
fashioned...
the
court
uses
all
kinds
of
terms
like
fashioned,
adopt,
seek
to
undertake
and
so
on.
it
all
suggests
that
it's
the
covered
jurisdiction's
initiative
that
leads
to
this
voting
change,
and
they
have
the
burden
to
show
that
it
isn't
a
bad
thing.
why
should
the
state,
which
has
never
been
viewed
a
covered
jurisdiction
under
any--
mr.
daniel
g.
stone
--i--
mr.
daniel
g.
stone
--i
would
very
much
dispute
that.
this
county
has
less
than
1.2
percent
of
the
state
of
california
population.
all
four
covered
counties
within
the
state
combined
have
less
than
3
percent--
mr.
daniel
g.
stone
--it
was
not.
the
test
for
coverage
is
two-pronged.
one
is
the
existence
of--
mr.
daniel
g.
stone
--but
the
state's
literacy
test
was
not
a
wrong.
there
were
literacy
tests
across
the
country
at
the
time
the
voting
rights
act
was
passed.
the
wrong
congress
looked
at,
and
again
it
was
just
a
formulaic,
mechanical
wrong,
but
it
was
the
voter
turnout,
because
congress
recognized
that
literacy
tests
were
prone
to
abuse.
they
had
all
manner
of
room
for
local
discretion.
so
it's
not
the
test.
if
it
were
the
test,
then
every
state
that
had
a
test
would
be
a
covered
jurisdiction
thereafter.
mr.
daniel
g.
stone
and
every
county
in
california.
mr.
daniel
g.
stone
but
isn't
that
anomalous
when
the
county
can
do
nothing
to
change
it,
and
the
county
is
asked
to
come
and
defend
it.
it
may
not
have
the
desire
to
defend
it.
this
particular
county
may
be
entirely
against
the
state's
new
law
or
new
policy.
it
may
not
have
the
financial
resources
fairly
and
adequately
to
defend
it,
and
it
comes
in
there
without
any
power
to
change
it,
so
you
would
have...
and
one
needs
look
no
further
than
this
case
to
see
the
kind
of--
mr.
daniel
g.
stone
--well--
mr.
daniel
g.
stone
--but
the
question
is
whether
there's
any
justification,
any
constitutional
justification,
i
would
submit,
for
assuming
wrongdoing
on
the
part
of
a
noncovered
state
without
approving--
mr.
daniel
g.
stone
--well--
mr.
daniel
g.
stone
--but
you
have
shifted
the
burdens.
if
you
require
a
noncovered
jurisdiction
to
come
and
prove,
absent
any
proof
of
wrongdoing,
you've
shifted
the
burdens
in
a
manner
that
i
suggest
is
unconstitutional.
in
katzenbach
this
court
pointed
out
what
a
very
important
element
it
was
for
congress
surgically
to
have
identified
the
wrongdoers
before
imposing
the
preclearance
requirement.
mr.
daniel
g.
stone
thank
you.
