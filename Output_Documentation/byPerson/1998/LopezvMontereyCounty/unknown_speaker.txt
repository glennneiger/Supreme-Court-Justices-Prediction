unknown
speaker
well,
but
if
it's
a
fair
reading
of
the
statute
it
has
weight
in
its
own
right,
doesn't
it,
even
if
it
might
be
contrary
to
some
earlier
decisions
of
this
court.
unknown
speaker
well,
the
courtesy
legislation
point,
i
mean,
i
guess
you
have
to
acknowledge
that
a
covered
county
can
do
some
nasty
things
which
it
hasn't
tried
to
do
before
by
getting
the
state
to
acknowledge
state-wide
legislation.
no?
unknown
speaker
if
you
appeal
the
plain
language,
what
do
you
do
when
the
state
adopts
a
general
provision
of
legislation?
does
each
county
within
the
state
that
happens
to
be
covered
have
to
clear
that
piece
of
legislation?
my
understanding
is
that
it's
simply
the
state
that
preclears
it
and
when
that
happens
the
county's
okay.
unknown
speaker
why
wouldn't--
--but
if
you're
appealing
to
the
plain
language,
does
the
plain
language
suggest
that
either
the
state
or
the
county
can
do
it?
unknown
speaker
i'm
not
sure
i
understand
you.
what
plain
language
is
it
that
you're
relying
on?
is
it
the
seek
to
administer?
unknown
speaker
suppose
the
state
has
not...
pardon
me.
suppose
the
county
has
no
discretion.
you
shall
consolidate
the
judicial
district.
does
the
state...
does
the
county
seek
to
administer
such
a
provision?
it's
not
asking.
seek
means
advice.
i
might
seek
your
advice.
the
state
isn't
really...
or
the,
pardon
me.
the
county
really
isn't
asking
to
do
anything.
it's
being
told
by
the
state
to
do
it.
let's
assume
no
discretion.
let's
assume
the
state
has
no
different
options.
unknown
speaker
well,
it's
not
seeking
to
do
anything.
it's
just
ministerially
complying
with
a
command
from
the
state.
unknown
speaker
but
it's
not
seeking
to
in
the
sense
of
wanting
to,
of
asking
to.
it's
simply
obeying
a
command
from
the
state.
unknown
speaker
you
say
a
huge
exemption,
but
it's
perfectly
arguable
from
the
language
that
that's
what
congress
intended.
unknown
speaker
well,
but
isn't
there
an
argument
on
the
other
side,
that
here
we
deal
with
national
and
state
relations,
and
that
since
this
does
impinge
on
them,
it
should
probably
not
get
a
terribly
sweeping
interpretation.
here
congress
has
stepped
into
the
state...
the
state
local
business.
unknown
speaker
precisely,
so
let's
look
at
the
language
and
not
some
cry
for
a
very
broad
interpretation
of
it.
unknown
speaker
well,
one
of
your
arguments
is
the...
what...
the
risk
of
what
you
refer
to
as
the
courtesy
legislation,
that
in
fact
if
state
law
itself
is
a
means
to
avoid
section
5,
the
usual
state
capitol
log-rolling
will
simply
mean
that
the
counties
will
get
the
legislature
to
enact
what
they
want.
is
it
an
answer
to
that
to
say
that
a
line
should
be
drawn
between
legislation
which
affects
only
a
covered
county
and
general
legislation
which
in
fact
affects
every
county
in
the
state,
which
i
understand
is
the
case
here?
is
the
risk
sufficiently
reduced
in
the
case
of
bona
fide
state-wide
legislation
so
that
we
should
dismiss...
in
a
case
like
this
we
should
dismiss
the
concerns
about
courtesy
legislation?
unknown
speaker
well,
there's
two
things
there.
justice
souter
can
certainly
protect
his
own
question.
the
premise
of
his
question
was
that
there
was
state
legislation
which
applied
to
more
counties
than
monterey,
and
he
said,
would
that
be
a
difference.
and
then
you
say,
well,
this
1979
statute
applied
only
to
monterey.
that
doesn't
really
quite
answer
his
question
as
a
principle
of
law.
unknown
speaker
why
don't
you
answer
the
question,
first
as
to
whether
or
not
his
suggestion
about
the
principle
is
accurate,
then
you
can
say
whether
or
not
the
principle
applies
here.
unknown
speaker
well,
but
that's
the
issue.
unknown
speaker
i
mean,
that's
the
issue,
and
one
of
your
reasons
for
saying
that
they
must
be
is
that
unless
the
general
legislation
is
so
submitted
with
respect
to
those
counties,
legislation
at
the
state
level
will
simply
be
used
as
a
cover
for
what
in
fact
is
local
discriminatory
efforts.
unknown
speaker
my
suggestion
was
that
perhaps
if
you
have
a
genuine,
bona
fide
legislative
act
intended
to
cover
the
whole
state
that
really
does
cover
the
whole
state,
that
you
don't
have
that
concern,
and
why
isn't...
why
would
you
have
that
concern
in
the
case
of
state-wide
legislation?
unknown
speaker
you're
saying
that
it
might
lack
intent
to
discriminate
but
have
the
effect.
unknown
speaker
could
i
ask
you
to
identify
what
relief
you
actually
want?
this
has
had
a
complicated
history,
the
justice
and
municipal
courts
in
monterey
county.
what
precisely
are
you
now
asking?
are
you
trying
to
get
preclearance
of
the
california
state
law
in
1979
consolidating
municipal
courts
into
a
single
district,
or
the
county
ordinance
that
same
year,
or
both?
it
isn't
clear
to
me.
unknown
speaker
well,
yes,
fine,
but
i'm
trying
to
pin
it
down.
you
want
preclearance,
in
effect,
of
the
1979
county
consolidation
ordinance.
unknown
speaker
and
the
1979
state
law
to
the
same
effect.
unknown
speaker
and
even
if
you
get
some
kind
of
preclearance
and
review
in
the
meantime,
state
law
has
changed
again,
and
has
totally
eliminated
judicial
districts.
unknown
speaker
there's
a
constitutional
amendment
now
that
eliminated
justice
of
the
peace
courts,
and
there's
a
state
law
increasing
municipal
judges
from
seven
to
nine
in
the
county,
and
that
was
precleared.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
so
at
the
bottom
line,
what
are
you
trying
to
get?
unknown
speaker
but
under
state
law
today
it
has
to
be
one
judicial
district,
so--
unknown
speaker
--what's
available
at
the
end
of
the
line?
i
just
don't
see.
unknown
speaker
please
tell
me
what
it
is
at
bottom
you're
trying
to
get.
are
you
trying
to
go
back
to
some
separate
district
system--
unknown
speaker
--or
separate
elections?
what
is
it
you're
trying
to
achieve
at
the
end
of
the
day?
just
tell
me.
unknown
speaker
well,
what
do
you
say
that
is?
is
it
by
separate
districts,
or
a
single
1983
judicial
district?
unknown
speaker
there's
nothing
that
you're
trying
to
get,
then?
well,
i...
in
concrete
terms,
i'd
like
to
know
what
you
are
seeking.
unknown
speaker
well,
state
law's
eliminated
multi-member
districts
now.
unknown
speaker
so
monterey
county
could
be
excluded
from
this
general
state
legislation,
under
your
view?
unknown
speaker
i
thought
it
was...
i
thought
it
was
they
had
enacted...
revised
the
justice
court
system
for
the
entire
state.
unknown
speaker
well,
but
as
a...
it
seems
almost
like
you're
avoiding
answering.
are
you
seeking,
then,
municipal
courts,
or
do
you
want
to
go
back
and
have
some
justice
of
the
peace
courts,
too?
unknown
speaker
municipal
courts.
unknown
speaker
and
how...
and
in
monterey
county,
do
you
want
them
elected
by
judicial
districts
or
in
one
single
district,
as
state
law
now
provides?
unknown
speaker
thank
you.
unknown
speaker
very
well,
mr.
avila.
mr.
wolfson,
we'll
hear
from
you.
unknown
speaker
isn't
that
all
pursuant
to
state
law?
unknown
speaker
even
the
entire
compliance
with
the
law
of
another
sovereign,
the
state,
you
know,
put
up
polling
places,
that
is
seeking
to
administer
something?
unknown
speaker
you're
talking
about
literacy
tests
in
california?
unknown
speaker
how
does
that
bear
on
this
case?
unknown
speaker
but
i
don't
see
how
that
bears
on
the
issue
of
seeks
to
administer.
unknown
speaker
well,
but
if
you
couple
enact
with
seek,
enact
indicates
discretion.
unknown
speaker
and
here
i
noticed
you
told
the
chief
justice,
well,
the
county
has
to
do
the
polling
and
so
forth.
the
county
can't
do
districts.
districts
must
be
set
by
the
state.
am
i
right
about
that?
unknown
speaker
but
even
before,
the
districts
were
set
by
the
state
law,
were
they
not?
unknown
speaker
well,
supposing
the
state
of
california
says
there's
going
to
be
a
65-mile
speed
limit
on
our
highways,
and
the
county
police
are
going
to
enforce
it.
now,
is
that
something
the
county
is
seeking
to
administer?
they're
told
by
the
state
they
have
to
enforce
the
speed
limit?
unknown
speaker
and
how
about
the
speed
limit
question?
unknown
speaker
mr.
wolfson--
--they
submit,
or
the
state
submits?
unknown
speaker
it
has
been--
unknown
speaker
--both
if
you're
relying
upon
the
text
of
the
statute.
unknown
speaker
you
say
shall
seek
to
administer.
it
says
such--
unknown
speaker
--you
know,
such
state
or
subdivision.
unknown
speaker
and
that
happened
here,
didn't
it,
with
the
one
that
was
precleared?
unknown
speaker
it
was
the
state
that
submitted
it,
not
the
county.
unknown
speaker
may
i
get
back
to
you,
because
your
time
is
so
brief.
what
do
you
see
as
the
bottom
line,
because
as
i
understand
it
these
ordinances
cannot
be
precleared
because
the
county
has
already
admitted
that
they
are--
unknown
speaker
--they
dilute,
so
these...
submit
these
for
preclearance,
they
won't
make
the
grade,
so
what
happens?
unknown
speaker
but
at
least
the
county
at
a
prior
turn
admitted
in
the
d.c.
district
court.
unknown
speaker
but
then
last
time
around
we
were
told
there
was
no
way
that
they
could
do
anything
other
than
this--
unknown
speaker
--without
violating
state
law.
unknown
speaker
well,
what
is
it--
unknown
speaker
--but
isn't
that
what
the
district
judge
was
trying
to
do
for
years?
he
says,
come
up
with
something
that
satisfies
both
federal
and
state,
and
they
couldn't.
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
you
want
to
look
down
the
road.
this
thing
has
been
dragging
on
for
years.
unknown
speaker
why
can't
we
look
at
the
bottom
line
and
ask
what
we're
talking
about?
i
guess
bottom
line
from
your
perspective
is
violate
state
law
and
mandate
single
member
districts.
unknown
speaker
why...
why--
unknown
speaker
--well,
the
district
court
couldn't
come
up
with
any.
mr.
avila
couldn't
come
up
with
any.
what
do
you
have
in
mind?
unknown
speaker
so
what
is
the
common
sense...
suppose
california's
right,
suppose.
look,
we
don't
want,
says
california,
to
discriminate
against
anybody.
we're
trying
to
change
our
judicial
system.
we
don't
want
98,000
people
called
justice
judges.
we
want
municipal
judges,
and
there'll
be
one
municipal
judge
in
each
county,
or
four.
that's
all
we're
trying
to
do.
look
at
it
up,
down,
and
sideways.
we're
not
trying
to
do
anything
else,
no
discrimination.
now,
california
says
there
should
be,
if
that's
true,
a
fairly
simple,
efficacious
manner
of
bringing
it
about.
now,
in
your
opinion,
what
is
that
efficacious
manner,
consistent
with
the
law,
if
what
they
say
is
true,
we're
not
trying
to
discriminate,
we're
trying
to
help
our
judicial
system
function
better.
unknown
speaker
how
can
you
divide
it
into
districts
if
there's
only
like
one
municipal
judge--
unknown
speaker
--thank
you,
mr.
wolfson.
mr.
stone,
we'll
hear
from
you.
unknown
speaker
mr.
stone,
i
can't
help
but
ask,
was
the
issue
of
laches
explored
in
the
district
court
this
last
time
around?
unknown
speaker
i'm
having
just
a
little
bit
of
trouble
hearing
you.
unknown
speaker
well,
it
can
get
that
authority
from
the
district
court,
i
assume,
if
the
district
court
should
determine
that
that
is
the
only
way
to
bring
the
county
in
compliance
with
section
5.
unknown
speaker
does
the
district
court
prescribe
it,
even
if
it's
different
from
what
exists
elsewhere
in
the
state?
unknown
speaker
cannot
suspend
the
constitution
of
a
noncovered
jurisdiction
within
the
covered
jurisdiction?
unknown
speaker
why
not?
why
can't...
i
mean,
this
is
what
i
don't
understand
on
your
side
of
the
case.
assume
you're
right,
california
is
just
trying
to
implement
some
perfectly
reasonable
reform
of
the
justice
system,
but
they
say
that
if
you
implement
it
in
monterey
county
it
will
have
a
retrogressive
effect
in
respect
to
discrimination.
now,
you
think
one
thing,
they
think
the
other.
why
wouldn't
everyone
long
ago
have
gone
to
the
d.c.
circuit,
where
their
job
is
to
work
this
out?
i
mean,
that's
what
i
don't
understand
why...
why
this
has
gone
on
for
several
years
arguing...
i
don't
get
it,
in
other
words.
it
seems
like
a
typical
argument.
california
has
a
law
which
it
thinks
is
absolutely
perfect.
they
think,
as
applied
to
monterey
county
it
has
a
discriminatory
effect.
the
statute
says,
when
a
county
administers
a
law...
you
know,
a
covered
statute...
that
may
have
any
change
in
voting
at
all,
they're
supposed
to
go
to
the
d.c.
circuit,
so
why
aren't
you
in
the
d.c.
circuit?
unknown
speaker
yes,
well,
the
state
has
no
obligation,
they
say,
to
preclear
its
law
even
as
it
affects
monterey
county.
unknown
speaker
but
monterey
county
still
has
an
ordinance
of
its
own
and
wants
to
administer
the
state
law
so
it
can
seek
preclearance.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
uh-huh.
unknown
speaker
that's
what
they
say.
unknown
speaker
but
if
they're
right,
then
they'll
have
to
seek
preclearance,
and
if
the
federal
law
prevails,
it
can
prevail
over
california
state
law,
presumably.
unknown
speaker
but
it's
free
to
do
so.
unknown
speaker
it's
free
to
do
so
if
it
wants
to,
isn't
it?
couldn't
it
assume
the
burden
of
seeking
preclearance?
unknown
speaker
and
it
did,
it
did
for
the
1983
law.
the
state
did
seek
preclearance.
unknown
speaker
but
let's
assume
that
the
1983
clearance...
statute
was
precleared.
it's
been
conceded
that
it
was.
does
that
carry
you
home
on
the
grounds
that
the
1983
statute
permitted
the
consolidation
of
the
remaining
justice
courts
into
the
municipal
court,
and
everybody
knew
that
the
municipal
court
was
one
district
then
because
of
the
1979
statute?
do
you
make
any
argument
that
that
carries
you
all
the
way
home,
or
is
that
not
before
us,
or--
unknown
speaker
--but
if
the
justice
courts
are
turning
into
municipal
courts
it
doesn't
follow
that
the
municipal
courts
can't
sit
in
districts,
so
i
don't
know
if
the
1994
proposition...
i
think
it
was
191...
works.
unknown
speaker
well,
what
does
that
add
to
what
you
already
had
from
your
1983
statute--
unknown
speaker
--it
seems
to
me
you
don't
need--
unknown
speaker
--but
won't
they
say
that
still
doesn't
solve
the
problem
of
districting?
okay,
so
they're
municipal
court
judges.
they
still
want
them
to
sit
in
districts.
unknown
speaker
well,
but
of
course
if
the
federal
law
requires
it
then
state
law
has
to
give
way
in
monterey
county.
unknown
speaker
that's
the
point.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
mean,
what
do
you
think
the
supremacy
clause
of
the
constitution
is
all
about?
unknown
speaker
i
mean,
if
that
is
the
law...
if
that
is
the
law,
that
federal
law
requires
the
election
of
judges
by
district
in
monterey
county,
then
it
doesn't
matter
that
the
state
law
says
something
else.
unknown
speaker
well--
--but
that's
a
statutory
argument.
unknown
speaker
mr.
stone,
could
i
ask
you
a
question
about
the
conflict
with
the
california
law?
as
i
understand
the
california
law,
it
requires
a
county-wide
district
for
judicial
purposes,
for
jurisdictional
purposes,
but
does
it
speak
to
the
question
of
how
the
judges
will
be
elected?
in
other
words,
would
it
necessarily
conflict
with
state
law
if
the
county
had
a
rule
that
said
the
district
shall...
county-wide...
judges
have
county-wide
jurisdiction,
but
one
of
the
judges
must
be
a
resident
of
a
certain
part
of
the
county,
i
mean,
divide
up
the
county
residentially
for
voting
purposes,
something
like
that,
that
didn't
affect
their
jurisdiction,
would
that
conflict
with
state
law?
unknown
speaker
either
subdistricts
for
election
purposes
or
at
least
for
residential...
for
qualification
of
the
judges
to
live
in
a
certain
neighborhood
or
something
like
that.
unknown
speaker
you
think
there
would
have
to
be
county-side
voting,
though?
unknown
speaker
but
that
does
not--
--that
applies
to
all
counties?
unknown
speaker
but
there
are
some
counties--
--i
see.
--in
california
with
more
than
one
judicial
district.
unknown
speaker
mr.
stone,
this
is
not
in
the
record,
but
someone
told
me
recently
that
in
los
angeles
county
the
superior
court
judges
and
the
municipal
courts
have
been
combined
so
that
there'll
simply
be
one
kind
of
judge
there.
do
you
know
anything
about
that,
and
is
it
state-wide,
or
would
that
just
be
los
angeles
county?
unknown
speaker
mr.
stone,
is
there...
in
the
original
pleadings
was
there
both
a
section
2
and
a
section
5
case
brought
here?
unknown
speaker
so
this
is
just
a
section
5
case.
unknown
speaker
well,
is
part...
i
guess
the
reason
i
ask
this
is
this.
is
part
of
your
argument,
or
is
it
implicit
in
what
you're
arguing,
that
the
district
court
would,
in
fact,
have
great
discretion
to
fashion
a
remedy
if
it
found
a
section
2
violation?
it
could,
for
example,
say
the
only
way
to
eliminate
the
discriminatory
effect
that
i
find
is
to,
in
effect,
to
require
as
a
remedial
scheme
four
districts,
each
electing
one
judge,
as
opposed
to
one
district
from
which
four
are
elected.
however,
is
it
implicit
in
your
argument
that
the
judge...
that
the
district
court
does
not
have
that
degree
of
flexibility
under
section
5,
that
under
section
5
all
it
can
say
is,
you
are
supposed
to
preclear,
you
haven't,
therefore
preclear,
and
that
its
remedial
discretion,
its...
the
possibility
of
remedial
creativity
simply
cannot
go
beyond
that
kind
of
yes
or
no
order?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
so
that,
i
take
it,
is
the
reason
that
you're
saying
that
there
isn't
anything...
i
think
you're
saying
that
the
court
cannot
practically
do...
it
cannot
practically
order
the
kind
of
remedy
that
the
petitioners
would
like.
unknown
speaker
why
isn't
it...
look,
i'm
missing
something,
because
it
just...
i
thought
that
there's
a
statute,
and
what
the
statute
that
i
have
in
front
of
me
says
is,
whenever
a
political
subdivision
of
a
state...
now,
monterey
county
is
a
political
subdivision,
right?
unknown
speaker
and
it's
a
covered
subdivision,
right?
unknown
speaker
so
it
says,
whenever
a
political
subdivision
that
is
covered
shall
seek
to
administer
any
voting
qualification
or
prerequisite
to
voting.
now,
i
take
it,
in
addition
to
all
those
ordinances
the
new
state
law,
maybe
with
superior
counties,
everything
else,
is
a
prerequisite
to
voting.
i...
there's
no
argument
about
that,
is
there?
or
maybe
there
is--
unknown
speaker
--but
i
mean,
at
least
i
didn't
see
one
here.
unknown
speaker
all
right...
yes,
fine.
it
says,
whenever
that
happens,
what
it
says
the
political
subdivision
is
supposed
to
do
is
to
go
to
the
attorney
general
or
the
d.c.
circuit
and
get
it
cleared.
that's
what
the
copy,
i
think,
if
i'm
reading
it
correctly...
so
why
isn't
that
the
end
of
this
part
of
the
argument?
that
is,
you're
in
the
wrong
court.
you
ought
to
be
in
the
d.c.
circuit.
it
should
be
precleared.
now,
it
may
be
you
have
the
best
reasons
in
the
world.
it
may
be
that
they
filed
35
years
too
late.
it
may
be
that
there's
no
way
to
work
out
a
good
remedy,
other...
but
all
this
is
for
the
d.c.
circuit
to
decide,
not
for
the
california
court.
now,
that,
i
take
it,
is
their
basic
argument
here.
now,
what's
the
response
to
that
argument?
unknown
speaker
now,
but
i
just
read
you
the
statute,
i
take
it,
that
when
you
read
it
on
its
face
it
seems
to
be
that
it
is
subject
to
preclearance.
well,
that's
the
very
issue
here,
is
it
not?
unknown
speaker
yes.
i
mean,
that's
what
this
case
is
about,
to
say
yes
or
no
to
that,
and
if
we
say
yes,
then
the
district
court,
federal
district
court
in
california
has
to
simply
say
yes,
it's
covered,
period.
unknown
speaker
then
it
will
be
up
to
the
county,
if
it
wants
to
implement
election
of
judges
at
all,
to
seek
preclearance,
or
the
state
may,
according
to
the
attorney
general,
the
solicitor
general,
the
state
may
do
it
if
it
wants.
unknown
speaker
that's
what
i
was
trying
to
get
to.
unknown
speaker
it
also
came
from
a
federal
source,
which
was
of
equal
dignity
legally
with
section
5,
and
that's
not
what
we're
dealing
with
here.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
think
it's
totally
different.
if
federal
law
requires
something,
that
is
supreme,
and
obviously
the
covered
jurisdiction
has
no
choice.
this
is
a
state
law
requirement--
unknown
speaker
--so
federal
law
can
mandate
something
different.
unknown
speaker
well,
it
has
no
choice
but
to
obey
the
order
of
the
federal
court
when
the
federal
court's
intervention
is
sought.
in
the
meantime,
it
can't
hold
any
elections.
unknown
speaker
the
statute
doesn't
speak
of
discretion.
it
says,
administer,
so
our
question
is,
do
we
read
some
kind
of
discretion
in
there.
it
says--
unknown
speaker
--whether
it
seeks
to
administer.
unknown
speaker
well,
but
where
does
that
get
you?
i
mean,
of
course
sometimes
when
one
is
seeking
to
administer
something
one
may
exercise
discretion
in
figuring
out
how
to
do
it.
other
times
in
seeking
to
administer
something
one
need
not.
in
this
particular
case,
it
seems
to
be
nondiscretionary,
but
i
mean,
the
words,
seek
to
administer,
covers
both.
unknown
speaker
well,
it
could
be
interpreted
to
mean
anything
and
everything
that's
different
as
a
result
of
a
decision
made
at
a
non-federal
level.
that's
a
possible
interpretation.
unknown
speaker
well,
it
seeks
to...
it's
seeking
to
administer
a
state-directed
change
in
election
practices.
you
say
that's
not
covered
because
it
was
state-directed.
unknown
speaker
but
one
could
say
that
that's...
in
order
to
get
away
from
the
elephantine
loophole,
that
that's
a
reasonable
reading,
because
you
do
have
to
admit,
it's
a
fairly
large
loophole
if
you
say
any
covered
jurisdiction
doesn't
have
to
change...
it
doesn't
have
to
get
preclearance
whenever
the
state
law
authorizes
it.
unknown
speaker
no,
you
don't
think
it's
a
loophole,
but
it's
a
rather
large
noncovered
area
of
the
statute.
unknown
speaker
why
have
those
states
that
have
cleared
it
in
the
past
in
such
situations
done
so?
unknown
speaker
are
there
many
instances
in
which
states
have
not
done
so?
unknown
speaker
uh-huh.
unknown
speaker
do
you
know
of
any
where
they
have
not
done
so?
unknown
speaker
you
don't...
you're
not
aware
that
it's
a
practice
in
either
direction.
unknown
speaker
isn't
there
administrative
discretion
in
the...
was...
my
impression
was
that
for
quite
a
long
time
anyway
under
some
of
these
ordinances
monterey
had
considerable
discretion,
say,
to
set
boundaries,
which
they
could
have
drawn
in
different
ways,
and
even
where
there's
one
district
they'd
have
discretion
as
to
whether
to
have
a
residency
requirement,
for
example,
as
whether
not.
so
if
that
word
administer
means,
you
have
to
have
some
discretion,
which
i
don't
know
if
it
does
or
not,
but
if
it
does
mean
that,
isn't
there
a
significant
amount
here?
why
not?
unknown
speaker
and
now
do
they
have
some
in
respect
to,
say,
imposing
residence
requirements?
unknown
speaker
but
i'm...
if
they
wanted
to
divide
it
by,
in
effect
districts,
by
saying
you
have
to
have
one
of
the
10
from
this...
these
blocks,
and
another
of
the
10
has
to
live
in
a
different
place,
could
they
do
that?
unknown
speaker
in
the
counties
which
do
have
districts,
los
angeles,
for
instance...
i
assume
they
have
districts...
do
those
counties
set
the
district
lines,
or
does
the
state
legislature
do
that?
unknown
speaker
are
there
any
counties
in
the
state
of
california
with
multiple
judicial
districts
where
the
counties
set
the
district
lines?
unknown
speaker
so
then
there
would
be
no,
really
violation
of
overall
state
policy
for
monterey
to
do
this
by
compulsion
of
a
federal
court
in
the
d.c.
circuit--
unknown
speaker
--or
in
compliance
with
the
plan.
unknown
speaker
in
other
words,
some
counties
in
california
do
set
their
own
electoral
district
lines,
and
therefore
it
doesn't
necessarily
contravene
state
policy
to
do
so
in
monterey.
unknown
speaker
can
i
go
back
to
justice
kennedy's
question
for
just
a
moment?
the
state
policy
we're
talking
about
of
having
just
one
judicial
district
in
the
county
is
a
county-specific
state
policy,
not
a
general
state
policy,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
it
doesn't
seem
to
me
so
unusual
to
say
that
when
a
state
has
a
county-specific
policy
relating
to
a
covered
county,
that
there
may
be
special
reason
for
the
state
law
to
bow
to
the
federal
law
that
applies
only
to
that
county.
unknown
speaker
or
having
the
effect
of
undermining.
unknown
speaker
yes,
but...
that's
right,
and
the
state
can
do
that
just
as
readily
as
the
county
can.
unknown
speaker
in
fact,
more
readily,
because
it's
not
trying
to
be
careful
not
to
undermine
it,
and
that
makes
it
very
sensible
to
clear
the
state's
plans
for
what
it's
effect
is
in
the
county.
unknown
speaker
right,
but
once
you
acknowledge
that
there
need...
that
there...
the
only
wrongdoing
that's
relevant
is
past
wrongdoing,
that
there
need
not
be
intentional
wrongdoing
in
enacting
the
new
plan...
the
new
plan
may
simply
have
the
effect,
in
good
faith
and
without
the
intent
to
discriminate,
but
it
has
a
bad
effect.
once
you
acknowledge
that,
i
don't
see
any
reason
to
think
that...
any
reason
in
policy
why
the
state's
plan
having
that
effect
shouldn't
be
cleared
just
as
well
as
the
county's
plan
having
that
effect.
unknown
speaker
no,
but
you
can't
say
the
state
has
never
been
a
wrongdoer,
because
it
had
the
literacy
test
which
was
wrongful
to
the
extent
that
it
affected
counties
in
which
there
was
this
particular
result
that
occurred
in
monterey
county,
and
the
state
was
the
source
of
the
wrongdoing.
unknown
speaker
so
the
state
is
the
wrongdoer.
unknown
speaker
no,
but
was
it
not
a
state
statute
requiring
literacy
tests
that
was
the
wrong
that
gave
rise
to
the
coverage?
unknown
speaker
right,
but
half
of
it
was
by
the
state
and
half
was
the
impact
in
that
county.
unknown
speaker
every
county
in
california
would
be
covered.
unknown
speaker
no,
but
it
was--
--i
don't
accept
your
argument
that...
you
seem
to
assume
that
i'm
saying
the
state
has
to
clear
it.
i
don't
think
the
state
has
to
clear
it.
i
think
the
county
has
to
clear
it,
and
the
county
is
a
covered
jurisdiction.
unknown
speaker
well,
it
wasn't
anomalous.
if
you
go
back
into
history,
i
take
it
the
history
of
this
was
there'd
be
a
lot
of
places
in
the
south
where
they
vote
in
a
town
by
district,
and
say
they
were
40
percent
black
and
60
percent
white,
and
then
soon
as
you
had
to
let
black
people
vote,
what
they
did
was
suddenly
switch
to
a
system
that
was
a
single
district,
and
now
it
could
be
in
many
of
those
towns
they
would
have
said,
well,
we
won't
have
it
ourselves,
and
lo
and
behold
you
discover
the
state
legislature
implementing
it
throughout
the
entire
state.
of
course,
the
state's
a
covered
jurisdiction.
now,
historically
that
was
an
evil,
wasn't
it?
unknown
speaker
no,
but
in
states...
i
think
there
are
some
states
where
the
state
is
not
a
covered
jurisdiction,
and
i
take
it...
is
that--
--north
carolina.
north
carolina
i
thought
was,
and
i
thought
that
the
same
problem
would
exist
there,
and
that
that
was
the
history
of
this.
unknown
speaker
it
wasn't
to
assume
wrongdoing.
unknown
speaker
it
was
to
try
to
cure
the
problem
in
the
county.
unknown
speaker
thank
you,
mr.
stone.
unknown
speaker
mr.
avila,
you
have
3
minutes
remaining.
unknown
speaker
if
the
1983
statute
was
precleared,
wasn't
that
against
a
background
where
there
was
a
single
district,
and
why
shouldn't
that
end
this
case?
unknown
speaker
i
don't
understand.
if
the
1983
statute
provided
for
a
single
judicial
district,
and
this
has
been
precleared,
getting
back
to
justice
o'connor's
question,
what's
left?
