mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
under
section
5
of
the
voting
rights
act
a
covered
jurisdiction
like
monterey
county
must
obtain
preclearance
of
any
voting
change
that
it
enacts
or
that
it
seeks
to
administer.
this
change...
this
case
involves
voting
changes
that
the
county
seeks
to
administer.
in
every
election
for
county
judges,
monterey
county
oversees
and
implements
the
process
by
which
the
voters
are
registered,
by
which
candidates
are
placed
on
the
ballot,
and
by
which
the
winners
are
chosen
in
the
election.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
well,
the
county...
the
county
does
have
to
follow
state
law
in
some
respects,
but
the
county
operates
the
process.
i
mean,
when
we
refer
to
seeking
to
administer
the
voting
change,
we
read
that
to
mean,
it
runs
the
elections
by--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--yes,
it
is,
and
in
fact
i
point
to
two
examples.
first,
i
mean,
the
court
looked
at
a
very
similar
matter
in
perkins
v.
matthews,
where
the
state
of
mississippi
before
the
voting
rights
act
was
enacted
had
shifted
from
single
member
districts
to
at-large
elections,
and
when
eventually
the
city
got
around
to
complying
with
that
state
law
the
court
said,
the
change
had
to
be
precleared
even
though
the
formal
enactment
by
the
higher
sovereign
did
not
have
to
be
precleared.
another
example,
actually
that's
quite
relevant
here,
is,
of
course,
the
literacy
tests
that
occasioned
the
passing
of
section
5
of
the
voting
rights
act.
it's
quite
clear
in
this
case
that
those
tests
were
mandated
by
california
state
law,
and
they
were
implemented
throughout
the
state
of
california
at
the
county
level.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
literacy
tests
were
required
by
california
state
law.
they
were
struck
down
by
the
california
supreme
court
in...
i
believe
in
1970,
after
section
5
was
long
enacted.
now,
section
5--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--my
point
is
that
congress
understood
that
even
though
there
might
be
a
requirement
that...
a
requirement
of
the
state
sovereign
that
the
county
follow
some
procedures,
that
the
county
might
nonetheless
not
be
able
to
do
so
under
section
5.
and
in
situations
like
california
and
north
carolina,
a
very
important
example
that
was
ostensibly
discussed
when
the
voting
rights
act
was
initially
enacted,
it
was
clear
to
congress
that
there
could
be
situations
where
a
state...
there
might
be
nothing
wrong
per
se
with
a
state
law,
but
the
effects
that
it
had
in
certain
jurisdictions
did...
might
have
had
an
effect
on
minority
voting
rights--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--seeks
to
administer
means,
it
runs
the
election.
now,
if
i
may
address
justice
kennedy's
question
about,
doesn't
seek
to
administer
indicate
some
kind
of
discretion,
or
some
kind
of
wanting
to
administer
itself
and
not
just
following
state
law.
i
think
that's
a...
seek
to
administer
is
purely
temporal,
and
it
should
be
contrasted
with
enacts.
the
way
that
the
statute
is
written
is,
if
any
jurisdiction
enacts
or
seeks
to
administer
something,
a
voting
change,
then
it
has
to
obtain
preclearance.
now,
congress
didn't
say
seeks
to
enact,
because
the
legislature
can
formally
enact
it
into
state
law
without
obtaining
the
approval
of
the
attorney
general
or
the
district
court.
that
mean,
before
it's
actually
implemented
it
has
to
then
obtain
preclearance.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
i--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--well,
after
the
state...
i
mean,
after
the
state...
arguably
the
state
has
now
required...
has
now
required
one
district--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--no.
i
would
say
before
that.
certainly
at
the
very
beginning,
in
1968,
my
understanding
is
that
the
county
had
discretion
about
how
to
draw
those
districts
within
the
county
lines.
so
i
mean,
getting
back
to
the
point,
i
think
that
seeks
to
administer
simply
means
to
begin
to
run
the
process
by
which
elections
are
operated.
there's
no
doubt
that,
on
the
ground
that
counties
are
the
responsible
authorities
for
doing--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--i
think
that
it
would
be
seeks
to
administer.
i
mean,
there
are...
i
mean,
leave
aside
the
point
that
the
county
obviously
has
great
discretion
in
how
it
would
enforce
that,
but
even
so,
i
think
that
because
the
county
actually
operates
the
elections,
that...
you
know,
that
is
the
process
by
which
it
seeks
to
administer--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--i
would
say
it
seeks
to
administer,
because
it
is
foreseen
that
the...
by
hypothesis
that
the
county
patrol
are
the
ones
who
enforce
the
state
law
in
that
section.
i
do
want
to
point
out
that
it's
a
long
been
settled
administrative
practice
that
covered
counties
have
been
required
to
submit
for
preclearance.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
it
has
been
both.
as
a
matter
of--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--right.
as
a
matter
of...
no--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--as
a
matter
of
convenience--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--right.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
as
a
matter
of
convenience,
from
the
point
of
view
of
administrative
practice,
the
attorney
general
has
recognized
that
when
a
state
law,
be
it...
when
a
state
law
that
generally
affects
one
or
more
counties,
but
say
when
it
affects
two
or
three
counties,
when
a
state
law
passes
it
is
more
convenient
for
the
state
to
submit
that
for
preclearance,
it
is
the
burden
is
ultimately--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--yes.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
that's
correct.
that's
correct,
it
did
happen
here,
and--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--right.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
i
mean,
i
need
to
be
very
cautious
here,
because
the
department
of
justice
has
not
seen
the
factual
evidence
underpinning
this,
so--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--i
think
that
there
are...
i
think
that
there
are
a
variety
of
ways,
assuming
that
the
county
still
believed
that
it
couldn't
successfully
submit
for
preclearance,
and
we
are
not
prejudging
that
question,
i
do
want
to
emphasize.
it
might
be
that
they
would
turn
to
single
member
districts
instead
of
at-large
voting.
there
might
be
other
ways
in
which
section
5
concerns
could
be
accommodated,
like
resident--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--right.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
that's
correct,
but
i
think
that
they're...
first
of
all,
in
the
end,
if
state
law
conflicts
with
section
5
they
have
to
follow
section
5,
but
i'm
not
sure
that
that's
the
only...
i'm
not
sure
that
dividing
the
county
into
single
districts
is
the
only
option
they
have.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
there
could
be
residency
requirements
for
judges.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
well,
again
i
have
to
say,
i
think
the
only
question
here
is
whether
preclearance
is
required.
the
department
of
justice--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--i
under--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--if,
but
only
if,
it's
determined
that
the
state
law
would
be
retrogressive.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
i
don't
think
that
single
member
districts
is
the
only
way.
there
are
other
options.
there
may
be
other
options.
we
have
not
looked
at
it,
and
i
cannot--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--well,
there
are
situations,
for
example,
where
a
county
is...
where
there's
at-large
voting
but
judges
are
required
to
reside
in
different
parts
of
the
county,
so
that
that
might
not
violate
the
elector...
the
separation
of
electoral
and
jurisdictional
bases.
i
don't
know
whether
that's
been
explored.
i
don't
believe
it
has,
but
if
that
were
submitted
to
us
we
would
certainly
examine
that
to
determine--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--i
think
that
there
are...
i
mean,
dividing
it
into
districts
could
be
one
way.
if...
that
doesn't--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--there's
10
judges.
there's
10
judges
on
this
municipal
court,
and
so
dividing
it
into
districts
could
be
one
way
of
making
sure
that
there's
no
retrogression
and
also
having...
not
having
a
situation
where
you
had
before,
consolidation
where
there
were
200
people
for
each
judge.
you
could
still
have
consolidation
that
would
give
you
the
benefits
of
a
more
efficient
judicial
system,
but
it
might
not
be
fully
at-large.
thank
you.
