mr.
joaquin
g.
avila
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
question
before
you
is
whether
a
voting
change
is
required
to
be
precleared
prior
to
its
implementation
within
a
section
5-covered
jurisdiction.
section
5,
plain
language,
its
purpose,
administrative
interpretation,
and
congressional
ratification,
answer
that
question
in
the
affirmative.
the
state
of
california's
statutory
construction
argument
would
undermine
the
broad
purpose
of
section
5
as
articulated
by
this
court.
mr.
joaquin
g.
avila
yes,
it
would.
if
there's
any
ambiguity
in
the
plain
language
of
the
statute
then
you
would
look
at,
not
only
at
prior
precedent,
but
also
you
would
look
at
the
structure,
the
overall
structure
of
the
act,
that
is,
the
interrelationship
between
sections
4
and
5,
and
also
you
would
look
at
the
attorney
general's
longstanding
interpretation
of
the
act,
and
the
legislative
history,
which
confirms
congress'
awareness
and
ratification
of
that
interpretation.
and
when
you
look
at
the
focus
of
section
5,
it
is
on
the
covered
jurisdiction
and
whether
its
voting
practices
have
changed,
irrespective
of
the
source
of
the
voting
change,
but
the
state's
construction
would
immunize
a
covered
voting
change
so
long
as
a
state
enacted
a
superseding
statute,
even
if
that
statute
was
never
subjected
to
preclearance.
this
construction
would
create
what
has
been
described
as
a
loophole
the
size
of
a
mountain.
two
examples
of
such
loopholes
are:
1.
counties
could
evade
section
5
review
by
securing
courtesy
legislation
at
the
state
level.
2.
section
5
review
of
redistricting
plans
would
be
circumvented.
on
the
other
hand,
a
harmonious
interpretation
of
the
statute
is
achieved
by
construing
section
5
consistently
with
section
4.
mr.
joaquin
g.
avila
that's
correct.
the
problem,
however,
is
that
the
state's
argument,
if
adopted
by
this
court,
would
result
in
major
loopholes
in
the
section
5
preclearance
provision
and,
in
this
particular
instance,
it
would
immunize
the
county's
voting
changes
from
section
5
review.
mr.
joaquin
g.
avila
if...
the
focus
is
on
the
voting
changes
that
occur
within
the
covered
jurisdiction.
if
the
state
enacts
a
statute
that
affects
voting
changes
within
our
covered
jurisdiction,
either
the
state
or
the
county
can
submit
either
the...
the
legislation
for
section
5
preclearance.
mr.
joaquin
g.
avila
the
plain
language
of
section
5
would
suggest
that
either
a
covered
state
or
a
political
subdivision,
but,
however,
the
responsibility,
the
primary
responsibility
would
be
on
monterey
county
to
make
sure
that
it
submits
any
voting
change,
irrespective
of
its
source,
when
it
effectuates
a
voting
change
in
that
covered
county.
mr.
joaquin
g.
avila
yes,
it
is,
and
the
seeks
to
administer
refers,
in
fact,
to
the
act
of
administering,
not,
as
the
state
argues,
to
an
administrative
act.
again,
the
focus
is
on
the
covered
jurisdiction
and
whether
its
voting
practices
have
changed.
mr.
joaquin
g.
avila
that
interpretation,
seeks
to
administer
means
seeking
to
implement.
as
this
court
in
the
first
opinion,
it
stated--
mr.
joaquin
g.
avila
--it
is
implementing
a
voting
change.
mr.
joaquin
g.
avila
well,
even
if
it
obeys
a
command
from
the
state,
when
it
effectuates
voting
change
within
that
covered
jurisdiction
it
has
to
be
submitted
for
section
5
preclearance,
otherwise
you're
going
to
create
huge
exemptions,
especially
in
states
that
have...
that
include
covered
section
5
counties,
like
north
carolina.
mr.
joaquin
g.
avila
it
is
a
re...
it
is
one
interpretation.
however,
the
attorney
general,
which
is
charged
with
the
central
enforcement
of
this
section
5,
could
also
have
another
reasonable
interpretation,
and
that
reasonable
interpretation
in
the
past
has
been
deferred
to
by
this
court,
especially
in
matters...
especially
in
terms
of
interpreting
its
regulations
as
they
apply
to
matters
affecting
voting,
and
in
presley
that
was
the
case.
in
presley,
section
5's
broad
scope
as
it
relates
to
election
matters
was
given
a
very
broad
scope,
and
that...
and
the
attorney
general
in
this
case
has
been
interpreted--
mr.
joaquin
g.
avila
--yes,
but
that
balance,
that
balance
between...
that
delicate
balance
that
was
struck
by
congress
back
in
1965
between
a
state's
sovereignty
and
the
federal
interest
in
eliminating
the
blight
of
voting
discrimination,
that
was
struck
in
1965,
and
it's
been
reratified,
or
ratified
three
times.
mr.
joaquin
g.
avila
it
is
not
a
cry
for
a
very
broad
interpretation.
in
fact,
what
we're
seeking
to
do
in
this
case
is
just
merely
maintain
what's
been
going
on
since
1965.
and
that
is,
when
you
have
the
attorney
general
reviewing
redistricting
plans
for
1970,
1980,
and
1990
from
north
carolina,
new
york,
and
california,
which
are
states
that
contain
covered
counties,
when
you
look
at
that,
and
you
look
at
the
congressional
record
that's
cited
in
our
briefs,
you
find
that
in
fact
in
the
1982
reenactment
of
the
voting
rights
act
you
find
explicit
references
in
the
senate
report
that
say,
while...
quote,
while
north
carolina
as
a
state
is
not
subject
to
section
5,
the
legislation
in
question
affected
north
carolina
counties
which
are
covered,
and
therefore
it
should
have
been
precleared.
and
when
you
look
at
another
page
reference,
at
page
14
in
that
senate
report,
it
explicitly
refers
to
letters
of
objection,
which
they
found
to
be
compelling
evidence
for
reenacting
section
5,
and
one
of
those
letters
of
objection
on
page
11
of
that
senate
report
is
the
1981
redistricting
plan
for
north
carolina.
so
we
have
this
history
of
administrative
interpretation
and
this
history
of
congressional
ratification
of
that
interpretation,
and
so
when
we...
and
in
addition
to
that,
when
you
look
at
the
overall
structure
of
the
act
and
the
interrelationship
between
section...
sections
5
and
section
4,
we
find
even
more
compelling
reasons
for
maintaining
the
status
quo.
in
katzenbach,
this
court
stressed
the
interrelationships
between
sections
4
and
5,
and
stated
that
section
5
was
designed
to
march
in
lockstep
with
section
4.
in
katzenbach
and
gaston
county,
this
court
approved
section
4's
statutory
framework
which
suspended
state
literacy
laws
in
section
5-covered
counties,
even
though
the
state
itself
was
not
a
designated
jurisdiction.
in
other
words,
all
literacy
tests
that
were
suspended
in
the
covered
counties
were
products
of
state
law.
mr.
joaquin
g.
avila
yes,
because
in
fact
the
state
of
california
has
a
choice
here
in
enacting
state
legislation.
when
we
look
at
the
1979
state
statute
we
find
that
california
in
fact
directed
its
legislative
effort
towards
one
county.
the
statute
specifically
mentions
monterey
county.
mr.
joaquin
g.
avila
yes.
mr.
joaquin
g.
avila
the
principle
of
law
is
that
when
you
have
a
state-wide
statute
that
has...
that
affects
voting
changes
throughout
the
state,
and
four
of
those
counties
in
california
are
subject
to
section
5,
those
state
statutes
would
have
to
be
submitted
for
section
5
preclearance.
mr.
joaquin
g.
avila
yes.
mr.
joaquin
g.
avila
that's
correct.
mr.
joaquin
g.
avila
we
would
have
that
concern,
if
i
understand
the...
your
question,
because
it
might
still
have
mischief
in
other
counties.
for
example,
if--
mr.
joaquin
g.
avila
--that's
correct,
and
really
that's
a
question
for
another
proceeding,
because
here
we
are
still
in
the
enforcement
stage
of
section
5,
and
that
issue
would
be
best
addressed
when
you're
reviewing
the
substantive
determination
of
whether
a
state-wide
statute
has
a
discriminatory
purpose,
or
has
a
discriminatory
effect.
mr.
joaquin
g.
avila
we
are
trying
to...
both.
the
quick
answer
is
both.
we
are
trying
to
basically
enforce
this
court's
first
opinion,
which
stated--
mr.
joaquin
g.
avila
--that's
correct.
mr.
joaquin
g.
avila
that's
correct,
and
that's
the
premise
of
our
argument,
because--
mr.
joaquin
g.
avila
--well--
mr.
joaquin
g.
avila
--yes,
it
was.
the
1983
state
statute
was
precleared.
mr.
joaquin
g.
avila
the...
what
is
important,
however,
is
that--
mr.
joaquin
g.
avila
--the
bottom
line
is
that
the
1983
preclearance
merely
involved
the
preclearance
that
this
court
found
from...
going
from
three
districts,
three
judicial
districts
to
one
county-wide
district
and
in
fact,
on
november
1,
1968,
we
had
nine
judicial
districts,
and
the
1983
state
statute
cannot
be
read
to
have
precleared
those
nine
districts
into
three
districts,
because
there's
no
reference,
the
attorney
general
had
no
notice--
mr.
joaquin
g.
avila
--that's
correct.
mr.
joaquin
g.
avila
well,
the
basis
for
that
one
judicial
district
is
that
if
that
judicial...
if
that
county-wide
district
is
to
be
precleared,
it
was
only
precleared
or
approved
from
the
change
from
three
judicial
districts
to--
mr.
joaquin
g.
avila
--no.
mr.
joaquin
g.
avila
at
the
end
of
the
day
we're
trying
to
have
an
election
system
that
complies
with
the
substantive
provisions
of
section
5.
mr.
joaquin
g.
avila
it
could
be
a
combination.
that
would
be
a
best...
a
remedy.
it
could
be
a
combination
of
districts.
it
can
be
a
combination
of
multi-member--
mr.
joaquin
g.
avila
--well,
what
we're
seeking
is...
basically
what
we're
looking
at
is
either
a
districting
plan
or
a
multi-member
districting
plan.
mr.
joaquin
g.
avila
but
if
we
have
a...
but
if
we
have
a
substantive
determination
that
the
at-large
election
system,
or
that
the
conversion
from
nine
districts
to
six
judicial
districts
is
in
violation
of
section
5,
then
the
district
court
is
best
able
to
address
that
particular
question
as
far
as
a
remedy
is
concerned.
mr.
joaquin
g.
avila
yes,
it
could.
in
fact...
in
fact,
monterey
county,
the
state
legislature
has
enacted
state
legislation
that
affected
just
monterey
county,
so
we're
not
asking--
mr.
joaquin
g.
avila
--that's
correct.
now,
we're
not...
we're
not
requesting
at
this
point
to
get
back
into
the
justice
courts.
basically
what
we're
asking
for
is
to
secure
compliance
with
section
5.
and
what
i'd
like
to
do
is--
mr.
joaquin
g.
avila
--we
want
to
maintain
municipal
courts.
mr.
joaquin
g.
avila
that's
right.
mr.
joaquin
g.
avila
we
want...
one
of
the
remedies
that
we
have
sought
is
the
election
by
judicial
districts.
mr.
joaquin
g.
avila
and
i'd
like
to
reserve
my
remaining
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
joaquin
g.
avila
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
referring
back
to
a
point
that
was
made
by
justice
scalia,
even
a
law
with
a
state-wide
effect
might
still
have
a
greater
effect
on
those
counties
that
congress
designated
for
section
5
purposes.
as
long
as
the
covered
jurisdiction
is
implementing
a
change,
section
5
applies,
and
that
common
sense
understanding
of
the
term
was
reflected
in
the
court's
earlier
opinion
in
this
case
when,
writing
for
a
unanimous
court,
justice
o'connor
stated
that
a
section
5-covered
jurisdiction
must
obtain
preclearance
before
"implementing"
a
voting
change.
those
were
the
words
used
by
this
court
to
describe
the
operative
effect
of
section
5,
and
when
we
look
at
the
administrative
practices
of
the
attorney
general
in
sheffield,
this
court
held
that
the
attorney
general's
interpretation
of
section
5
is,
quote,
persuasive
evidence
of
original
understanding.
so
what
we're
trying
to
do
in
this
case
is
merely
maintain
what's
been
going
on
for
the
past
three
decennial
redistrictings,
and
when
we
look
at
what...
in
fact,
what
the
state
of
california
and
the
county
administers
at
the
local
level,
we
know
that
the
county
administers
the
election
machinery
and
the
personnel
that
actually
administer
the
state
elections,
and
in
our
brief
we
cite
to
numerous
state
statutes
in
which
the
state
mandates
that
a
particular
election
occur,
and
that
the
county
is
directed
to
administer
that
election.
mr.
joaquin
g.
avila
it
does
not
end
the
case
because
when
you're
talking
about
reviewing
a
voting
change
you're
talking
about
what
happened
before
and
what
happened
after.
the
1983
state
statute
only
referred
to
the
conversion
from
three
judicial
districts
to
a
single
county-wide
district.
it
did
not
start
off
with
the
november
1968
nine
judicial
district
plan,
and
we
do
not
have
the
conversion
before
the
department
of
justice
or
the
d.c.
court
between
nine
districts--
mr.
joaquin
g.
avila
--what's
left
is
the
judicial...
what's
left
is
the
preclearance
of
nine
districts
which
existed
on
november
1,
1968,
to
three
districts
which
existed
in
1983.
the
1983
state
statute
only
converted
three
judicial
districts
into
a
single
county-wide.
whenever
you
examine
voting
change,
it's
examining
from
what,
from
what
is
it
being
changed
from,
to
what
is
it
being
changed
to,
and
that's
precisely
the
point
that
we're
making
in
this
argument.
thank
you
very
much.
