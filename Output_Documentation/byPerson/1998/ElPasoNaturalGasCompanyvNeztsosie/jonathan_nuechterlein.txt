mr.
jonathan
e.
nuechterlein
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
parties
agree
that
the
federal
courts
have
federal
question
jurisdiction
to
decide
at
some
point
whether
these
nuclear
tort
claims
brought
initially
under
tribal
law
fall
within
the
preemptive
scope
of
the
price-anderson
act.
the
question
here
is
whether
the
prudential
rule
of
tribal
court
exhaustion
delays
the
date
on
which
the
federal
courts
will
decide
that
issue,
even
though,
as
justice
ginsburg
points
out,
if
this
suit
had
been
filed
in
state
court,
the
federal
courts
would
indisputably
decide
that
issue
now.
the
answer
is
that
the
tribal
exhaustion
doctrine
does
not
have
that
anomalous
consequence,
and
the
reason
is
specific
to
the
price-anderson
act.
the
act
deems
any
claim
for
public
liability
brought
under
any
source
of
law
to
be
a
federal
claim
arising
directly
under
price-anderson.
congress
designed
that
complete
preemption
regime
to
make
federal
court
review
available
from
the
inception
of
any
nuclear
tort
suit.
congress
took
that
step
because
it
wanted
to
make
nuclear
tort
litigation
more
predictable,
more
uniform,
and
more
efficient,
because
it
wanted
to
ensure
consolidation
of
any
related
cases,
and
because
it
wished
to
ensure
centralized
control
over
compensation
claims.
application
of
the--
mr.
jonathan
e.
nuechterlein
--we
disagree.
mr.
jonathan
e.
nuechterlein
that
is
correct,
and
we
dis--
mr.
jonathan
e.
nuechterlein
--that
is
correct.
we
disagree
with
that
argument
on
the
merits,
but
the
initial
point
is
that
there...
there
is
a
dispute
about
which
court
will
resolve
that
issue
in
the
first
instance.
respondents
claim
that
the
tribal
exhaustion
doctrine
requires
the
tribal
courts
to
decide
that
issue
in
the
first
instance.
our
position
is
that
that
would
be
inconsistent
with
the
point
of
this
statutory
scheme,
which
is
to
ensure
that
the
defendant
has
an
absolute
right
to
a
federal
forum
for
the
resolution
of
any
dispute
about
the
effect
of
the
price-anderson--
mr.
jonathan
e.
nuechterlein
--one
option
this
court
has
is
to
reverse
the
ninth
circuit
on
the
threshold
exhaustion
issue,
and
to
remand
to
the
lower
courts
for
a
substantive
determination
as
to
whether
respondents'
claims
in
fact
fall
within
the
preemptive
scope
of
the
price-anderson
act.
if
they
do,
then
those
claims
are
properly
litigated
in
federal
court.
if
they
do
not,
then
it
may
be
that
the
tribal
courts
would
retain
jurisdiction
over
the
suit.
mr.
jonathan
e.
nuechterlein
i
disagree
with
that.
congress
anticipated
there
would
be
circumstances
where
the
parties
would
disagree
about
whether
the
price-anderson
act
is
applicable,
and
whether
price-anderson
rules
would
therefore
apply.
congress
wanted
any
dispute
like
that
to
be
in
federal
court
from...
if...
at
the
election
of
the
defendant.
mr.
jonathan
e.
nuechterlein
it
did
provide
a
removal
provision
for
state
courts,
and
it
also--
mr.
jonathan
e.
nuechterlein
--that's
correct,
and
it
is
probably
the
case
that
congress
was
simply
not
thinking
about
tribal
courts
when
it
enacted
this
law,
so
the
question
then
is,
would
it...
would
it
violate
congressional
intent
to
permit
price-anderson
suits
to
persist
in
tribal
court,
despite
what
appears
to
be
a
clear
statutory
preference
for
having
all
price-anderson
claims
litigated
in
federal
court.
mr.
jonathan
e.
nuechterlein
that's
correct,
but
by
enacting
a
complete
preemption
statute
congress
signals
its
intent
to
have
all
litigation
within
a
particular
sphere
to
occur
in
federal
court
and
also--
mr.
jonathan
e.
nuechterlein
--but
the
point
here
is
that
there
is
no
need
for
a
removal
provision,
because
everybody
agrees
the
federal
courts
have
federal
question
jurisdiction
to
address--
mr.
jonathan
e.
nuechterlein
--no,
it
doesn't
beg
the
question
of
exhaustion,
because
again,
the
very
process
of
exhausting
tribal
remedies
in
this
context
would
frustrate
this
statutory
scheme.
the
whole
point
of
the
statutory
scheme
is
to
give
defendants
an
absolute
right
to
choose
a
federal
forum
for
litigation,
not
just
of
claims
that
are
deemed
to
be
within
price-anderson,
but
also
of
any
threshold
dispute
about
whether
claims
in
fact
fall
within
price-anderson.
that
is
clearly
the
congressional
intent,
and
the
question
here--
mr.
jonathan
e.
nuechterlein
--that
conclusion
clearly
follows
from
the
price-anderson
act,
and
you
can
tell
that
but
not
just
from
the
enactment
of
a
removal
provision,
but
also
from
congress'
taking
the
extra
step
of
deeming
any
action
asserting
public
liability
to
be
a
claim
arising
within
the
scope
of
the
price-anderson
act
itself.
mr.
jonathan
e.
nuechterlein
that
is
correct.
mr.
jonathan
e.
nuechterlein
that
is
correct,
and
it
is
significant
that
congress
provided
that
substantive
state
law
would
apply
in
price-anderson
suits.
that,
of
course,
may
be
different
from
the
law
that
tribes
would
apply,
and
on
top
of
that,
it's
also
important
to
remember
that
the
removal
statute
itself
was
originally
enacted
in
1966.
the
1988
amendments
expanded
the
scope
of
the
removal
statute
to
extend
beyond
extraordinary
nuclear
occurrences
to
include
all
nuclear
incidents,
of
which
we
claim
these
suits
are
an
example,
but
there's
no
indication
anywhere
in
the
legislative
history
that
congress
contemplated
that
tribal
courts
would
adjudicate
these
claims.
and
the
important
point
also
is
that
tribal
court
adjudication
of
these
claims
without
any
mechanism
for
transfer
to
a
federal
court
which
would
have
centralized
control
over
the
litigation
and
centralized
control
over
compensation
funds
would
present
all
of
the
problems
that
motivated
congress
in
1988
to
expand
the
removal
provision
at
issue
here.
it
would
clearly
frustrate
this
statutory
scheme
to
permit
suits
to
proceed
in
tribal
court
over
the
objection
of
the
defendant.
ultimately,
on
the
merits
issue
the
parties
address,
we
agree
with
petitioners
that
these
tort
suits
do,
in
fact,
fall
within
the
scope
of
the
price-anderson
act.
that
follows
from
the
plain
language
of
the
definitions
of
nuclear
incident
and
public
liability
as
they
appear
in
section
2014.
mr.
jonathan
e.
nuechterlein
i
think
that
is
one
appropriate
disposition,
although
the
answer
to
the
question
is
clear
enough
to
us
that
i
think
that
it
would
also
be
appropriate
for
this
court
to
decide
it
in
the
first
instance.
mr.
jonathan
e.
nuechterlein
well,
that...
that
unappealed
order
would
remain
intact
if
this
court
were
to
apply
ordinary
jurisdictional
rules,
so
ultimately
what
might
happen
is,
respondents
would
return
to
district
court
to
claim
that,
notwithstanding
any
answer
to
the
question
of
whether
these
claims
fall
within
price-anderson,
that
a
tribal
court
may
nonetheless
adjudicate
price-anderson
claims.
they
would
ask
the
district
court
at
that
point
to
lift
that
preliminary
injunction
and
would
then
litigate
that
issue
on
the
merits.
mr.
jonathan
e.
nuechterlein
our
position
is
that
it
would
be
inconsistent
with
the
whole
point
of
the
scheme
to
allow
these
suits
to
proceed
over
the
objection
of
a
defendant
in
tribal
courts,
because
that
would
present
exactly
the
same
litigation
problems
that
motivated
congress
to
enact
the
1988
amendments.
mr.
jonathan
e.
nuechterlein
yes,
in
the
same
way
that
state
courts
would
have
jurisdiction
in
the
absence
of
an
objection
from
the
defendant.
mr.
jonathan
e.
nuechterlein
the
basis...
it
would--
mr.
jonathan
e.
nuechterlein
--well,
it's
not
a
removal
provision.
mr.
jonathan
e.
nuechterlein
it's
taking
advantage
of
this
court's
holding
in
national
farmers
union
that
there
is
a
federal
common
law
cause
of
action
to
challenge
the
jurisdiction
of
tribal
courts.
mr.
jonathan
e.
nuechterlein
the
cause
of
action
would
be
that
the
exercise
of
jurisdiction
over
the
objection
of
the
defendant
would
be
inconsistent
with
the
structure
of
the
price-anderson
act
and
therefore
inconsistent
with
federal
law.
