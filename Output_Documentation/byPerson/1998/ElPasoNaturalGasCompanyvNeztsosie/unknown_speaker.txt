unknown
speaker
i'm
concerned,
mr.
atwood,
frankly,
with
the
procedural
posture
of
this
case.
now,
the
district
court
entered
kind
of
a
two-part
decision.
it
said
price-anderson
act
claims
could
not
proceed
in
tribal
court.
unknown
speaker
but
other
claims
could.
unknown
speaker
all
right,
and
then
an
appeal
was
taken
to
the
ninth
circuit.
unknown
speaker
by
you,
by
petitioners,
and
the
ninth
circuit
decided
a
question
that
wasn't
appealed.
unknown
speaker
well,
and
it
didn't
decide
other
questions.
now,
what
should
we
do
here?
should
we
just
decide
that
it
had
no
authority,
if
you
will,
to
decide
a
question
that
wasn't
appealed?
unknown
speaker
i
mean,
i
would
think
we
would
do
that.
unknown
speaker
that
wasn't
appealed.
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
but
the
court,
the
ninth
circuit
didn't
really
deal
with
that,
did
it?
unknown
speaker
i
thought
it
really
didn't
get
to
the
merits
of
that.
unknown
speaker
on
the
issue
where
the
court
of
appeals
reversed
and
it
was
not
appealed,
in
a
sense,
it's
not
your
fault.
you
don't
have
the
duty
to
appeal
a
favorable
ruling.
unknown
speaker
on
the
other
hand,
the
court
of
appeals
is
in
somewhat
of
a
difficult
position
if
it
feels
that
the
unappealed
ruling
and
its
rationale
are
logically
necessary
for
its
decision
on
the
part
that
is
appealed.
i'm
not
quite
sure
what
the
court
of
appeals
should
have
done.
unknown
speaker
mr.
atwood,
let
me
tell
you
my
problem
with
that.
it
seems
to
me
that
that
asks
us
to
decide
a
question
which,
in
the
light
of
the
question
that
you
want
us
to
forego,
may
well
be
utterly
academic.
that
is
to
say,
if
price-anderson
claims
can
be
brought
in
tribal
court,
contrary
to
the
injunction
here
that
you
want
us
to
leave
in
place,
if
they
can
be
brought
in
tribal
court,
then
it
makes
no
difference...
it
is
asking
an
academic
question
whether
you
will
allow
the
tribal
court
to
consider
and
will
allow
it
to
exhaust
whether
a
particular
claim
is
a
price-anderson
claim
or
not
a
price-anderson
claim.
that
question
is
a
nonquestion
if
both
claims
can
be
brought
in
tribal
court,
and
you
don't
want
us
to
reach
the
question
of
whether
both
claims
can
be
brought
in
tribal
court.
you
say
that's
been
decided,
and
that
injunction
wasn't
appealed,
so
forget
about
that
question.
but
unless
that
question
is
answered
in
the
opposite
way
from
the
way
the
district
court
answered
it,
namely,
answered
to
say
you
cannot
bring...
i'm
sorry,
you
can...
you...
yes...
no...
the
way
the
district
court
answered
it.
unknown
speaker
you
cannot
bring
price-anderson
claims
in
tribal
court,
then
the
question
of
whether
a
particular
claim
is
price-anderson
or
not
price-anderson
never
arises,
and
why
should
we
sit
here
and
deliberate
on
that
question,
and
ask
whether
the
tribal
court
can
decide
that
question,
and
it
must
be
exhausted,
when
it
may
well
be
a
question
that
never
arises?
unknown
speaker
what
are...
are
you
going
to
tell
us
what
they
are?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
right,
but
assume--
unknown
speaker
--so
you're
saying
that
borrowing...
borrowing
in
tribal
law
does
not
explain
all
that's
going
on.
if
you're
going
to
have
a
price-anderson
claim,
you're
going
to
have
something
beyond
just
borrow
tribal
law
so
the
two
actions
are
not
identical.
unknown
speaker
so
the
issue--
unknown
speaker
--so
the
issue
will
arise
in
tribal
court
even
if...
even
if
price-anderson
actions
are
allowable
in
tribal
court,
tribal
courts
will
still
have
to
decide
whether
a
particular
claim
is
price-anderson
or
not
price-anderson?
unknown
speaker
yes,
i
understand.
unknown
speaker
i
just
don't
want
to
decide
something,
you
know,
that
may
be
irrelevant
if
price-anderson
can
be
brought
in
tribal
court.
unknown
speaker
well,
could
the
court
of
appeals
have
said,
we're
going
to
resolve
the
tribal
claim
issues,
and
in
light
of
that
resolution
the
district
court
must
have
been
wrong
in
its
injunction,
assuming
it
came
out
that
way.
then
what
does
it
do?
we're
remanding
to
the
district
court
so
that
it
has
the
opportunity
in
the
first
instance
to
reconsider
its
ruling
or
something?
it's
a
preliminary
injunction.
it's
not
really
a--
unknown
speaker
--the
case
for
all
time,
if--
unknown
speaker
--the
case
at
all.
unknown
speaker
well,
it
may
not
come
back.
i
mean,
you
don't
know
for
sure
that
it
can
come
back
to
the
court
of
appeals.
it
depends
on
the
outcome
of
the
trial,
i
suppose.
unknown
speaker
and
on
who
wins.
unknown
speaker
but
they
weren't
passed
on
below,
those...
the
argument
that
it's
not
price-anderson
because
it
involves
mining,
and...
or
there's
no
indemnification
in
this
picture,
the
ninth
circuit
didn't
touch
those.
unknown
speaker
i'm...
now,
i
thought
i
understood
it,
and
now
i
realize
i
don't.
that
is,
i
thought
that
initially
the...
your...
the
plaintiff
files
a
claim
in
the
tribal
court.
unknown
speaker
and
it
says,
now,
my
relatives
or
others
were
killed,
and...
because
of
the
nuclear
waste,
the
nuclear
mining,
and
we...
we're
entitled,
as
a
result
of
negligence
law,
four
other
laws...
and
i
don't
think
they
mentioned
price-anderson,
did
they?
unknown
speaker
all
right...
they
didn't
even
mention
it.
all
right.
now
it
comes
to
the
district
court,
and
the
district
court
says,
your
motion
for
an
injunction...
that
is,
yours...
is
denied.
they
denied
it.
unknown
speaker
well,
they
denied
it,
and
then
he
adds
the
words
to
the
order,
except
insofar
as
the
defendant
seeks
relief
under
the
price-anderson
act
in
tribal
court,
which
he
hadn't
done.
so
since
he'd
never...
since...
the
only
way
i
can
imagine
to
read
that
is
that
the
exception's
irrelevant,
because
he
didn't.
nowhere
in
the
complaint
does
it
assert...
does
it...
nowhere
does
he
seek
relief
under
the
price-anderson
act
in
tribal
court.
he
didn't.
unknown
speaker
and
then
it
comes
to
the
court
of
appeals,
and
the
court
of
appeals
goes
into
the
discussion
of
whether
or
not
a
negligence
claim
is
preempted,
and
whether
you
can
assert
whether
it's
preempted
or
not
in
the
tribal
court
of
the
district
court,
the
kind
of
issue
that's
been
briefed
here.
so
once...
isn't...
i
mean,
there's
a
lot
of
briefs
here
about
whether
the
price-anderson
act
covers
a
negligence
claim,
and
it
makes
a
very
strong
claim
that
it
does,
because
it's
a
claim
of
negligence
that
arises
out
of
nuclear
waste.
you
know,
we
know
those
arguments
that
are
being
made.
unknown
speaker
all
right.
so
now
i
don't
know
what
to
do.
unknown
speaker
oh,
it
says
except...
yes,
you're
right,
except
to
the
extent
the
defendant
seeks
relief--
unknown
speaker
--under
the
price-anderson
act.
unknown
speaker
all
right.
suppose
we
issue
the
following
order,
which
i
think
would
take
one
paragraph.
suppose
you
said,
very
well,
you
considered,
court
of
appeals,
a
claim
that
had
never
been
raised.
you
can't.
end
of
the
matter.
now
go
consider
the
rest.
all
we'll
get
is
the
same
opinion
back,
but--
unknown
speaker
--but
that's
only
if
we
assume
that
all
their
claims
are
preempted
by
price-anderson.
unknown
speaker
but
that
gets
us
into
all
these
issues
about
what
price-anderson
preempts,
and
whether
it
covers
uranium
mining
at
all,
and
these
have
not
been
decided
by
a
lower
court.
unknown
speaker
and
all
of
a
sudden
you
want--
unknown
speaker
--us
to
decide
all
of
this.
i
don't
understand.
unknown
speaker
was
there
any
suggestion
or
any
possibility
of
interlocutory
determination
in
the
tribal
court
of
the
preemption
issue,
just
as
a
matter
of
law,
before
the
trial
on
the
merits?
unknown
speaker
in
strate
there
was
actually
a
jurisdictional
ruling
all
the
way
through
the
tribal
system,
and
then
the
federal
courts--
unknown
speaker
--mr.
atwood,
as
i
understand
it,
what
you
are
trying
to
do
essentially
is
to
make
a
substitute
for
the
removal
that
congress
didn't
provide
with
respect
to
tribes.
if
exactly
the
same
case
involved
a
state
court
action
and
the
plaintiff
had
said,
my
action
is
state
law
and
nothing
to
do
with
price-anderson,
you
could
wrench
that
out
immediately
and
have
the
federal
court
decide
that,
not
possible
because
congress
didn't
provide
that
mechanism.
is
there
any
clue
why
the
tribal
courts
were
left
out
of
the
removal
when
all
the
state
courts
in
the
land
were
included?
unknown
speaker
but
with
farmers,
that's
at
the
end
of
the
line,
but
the
removal
takes
the
case
out
of
the
state
court
and,
indeed,
there's
a
transfer
provision
if
you
bring
it
in
any
federal
court,
other
than
the
one
where
the
site
is.
unknown
speaker
thank
you,
mr.
atwood.
mr.
nuechterlein,
we'll
hear
from
you.
unknown
speaker
well,
respondents
now
put
forward
an
argument
that
the
personal
injury
claims
under
tribal
law
are
not
preempted,
that
in
the
case
of
uranium
mining
and
where
there
is
no
indemnity,
that
that
isn't
the
scheme.
unknown
speaker
nobody
has
addressed
that
in
the
lower
courts,
presumably.
unknown
speaker
in
this
case.
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
why
isn't
the--
--so
what
do
you
advise
that
this
court
do
in
the
face
of
the
kind
of
curious
posture
in
which
the
case
comes
here?
unknown
speaker
i
was
going
to...
you
may
have
touched
on
what
i
was
going
to
ask,
but
i'm
not
sure
that
i
understand
your
argument
for
complete
preemption,
because
i
thought
your
argument
for
complete
preemption
was,
congress
has
clearly
decided
that
these
things
ought
to
be
resolved
in
federal
forums,
and
yet
one
of
the
issues
before
us,
albeit
one
that
was
not
passed
on
by
the
lower
courts,
was
whether
this
particular...
whether
the
claims
here
fall
within
the
concept
of
public
liability.
i
mean,
i
was
going
to
say,
isn't
the
argument
essentially
circular,
because
there's
no
way
we
can
deal
with
the
exhaustion
issue
without...
or
any
court
can,
without
first
dealing
with
the
issue
of
whether
the
claims
here
are
within
the
umbrella
of
public
liability.
unknown
speaker
why
didn't...
if
it's
as
simple
as
that,
why
didn't
it
simply
provide
for
a
broad
removal
provision?
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
i
mean,
not
for
tribal
courts.
unknown
speaker
of
course,
if
we...
in
answering
that
question,
if
we
say,
well,
congress
is
presumed
to
know
the
way,
you
know,
the
courts
do
business,
i
think
your
position
would
run
up
against
this
difficulty,
and
that
is
that
the
instances
that
you
point
to
outside
of
price-anderson
for
the
concept
of
what
you
call
complete
preemption
in
your
brief
were,
i
think...
and
correct
me
if
i'm
wrong...
all
instances
in
which
there
was
an
express
removal
provision.
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
your
examples
of
complete
preemption
prior
to
this
case
are
all
examples
in
which
there
is
a
removal
provision,
is
that
not
correct?
unknown
speaker
sure,
but
that
begs
the
question
of
exhaustion.
unknown
speaker
and
you
say
this
is
the
congressional
intent
without
reference
to
this
background
set
of
cases
that
exemplify
complete
exhaustion
under
other
statutory
regimes.
you
say
that
conclusion
can
be
drawn
from
the
price-anderson
act
alone.
unknown
speaker
mr.
nuechterlein,
is
there
any
clue
that
congress
contemplated
tribes
at
all,
because
when
it
talked
about
how
the
substantive
law
would
be
shaped,
it
mentioned
state
law.
unknown
speaker
it
provided
for
removal,
but
it
seems
that
it
just
wasn't
thinking
about
the
tribes.
unknown
speaker
but
you
agree
that
that
question
should
get
a
first
view
by
a
lower
court.
unknown
speaker
if
we
reverse
on
the
ground
that
exhaustion
is
not
required,
what
does
the
ninth
circuit
do
with
reference
to
the
unappealed
order?
unknown
speaker
and
what's
the
government's
position
on
the
merits
question
of
whether
you
can
bring
price-anderson
claims
in
the
tribal
courts?
unknown
speaker
but
absent
objection,
do
they
have
jurisdiction?
unknown
speaker
what's
the
basis
for
the
objection?
i
don't--
unknown
speaker
--sort
of
a
cheap
removal
provision?
unknown
speaker
you
just
object
to
its
presence
there?
unknown
speaker
well,
i'm
sure
there
is
a
cause
of
action
to
challenge
it,
but
that
doesn't
say
that
there
isn't
any
jurisdiction.
it
just
says
there
is
available
a
cause
of
action
to
challenge
it.
what
is
the
basis
for
saying
there's
no
jurisdiction?
unknown
speaker
thank
you,
mr.
nuechterlein.
mr.
farr,
we'll
hear
from
you.
unknown
speaker
by
the
decision
below,
you
don't
mean
the
unappealed
order.
you
mean--
unknown
speaker
--the
entire...
so...
all
right.
unknown
speaker
well,
you
could
avoid
that
at
the
other
end
of
the
spectrum,
too.
unknown
speaker
i
say,
you
could
avoid
running
back
and
forth
between
tribal
courts
and
federal
courts
at
the
other
end
of
the
spectrum,
too,
and
say
that
the...
rule
against
your
contentions
in
all
respects.
unknown
speaker
well,
how
could
they?
that
is
to
say,
what
possible
reason
could
congress
have
if...
suppose
a
nuclear
power
plant
leaks,
you
know,
so
it's
quite
clearly
the
kind
of
thing
that
price
anderson
is
concerned
about.
the
nuclear
power
plant
leaks,
and
now
every
state
action,
of
which
there
would
be
thousands,
the
defendants
can
remove
to
federal
court
immediately.
that's
absolutely
clear
congress
wants
that
to
happen.
now,
what
reason
could
congress
have
for
saying
in
such
a
case
that
although
we
got
all
these
actions
in
federal
court
and
out
of
state
court,
nonetheless
we
want
them
to
proliferate
over
in
the
tribal
courts?
i
mean,
i
grant
you,
somebody
could
logically
say
that,
but
what
practical
reason
or
other
reason
would
there
be
for
that?
unknown
speaker
no,
what
we
have
is
a
leak,
you
know,
and
there's
a
cloud,
and
it
goes
and
hurts
some
people.
unknown
speaker
well,
once
you
say
that,
what's
the--
unknown
speaker
--well,
what
if
they
find
there's
a
truck
that
goes
through,
the
truck,
and
the
truck
leaks
nuclear
material,
so...
all
i'm
looking
for
is
an
example
which
clearly
is
within
price-anderson.
now,
once
we
have
the
example,
and
it
happened
there
was
a
truck...
we
can
imagine...
just...
it's
not
that
hard
to
think
of
a
case.
unknown
speaker
now,
what
reason
could
there
possibly
be
that
congress
would
have
wanted
to
take
all
those
cases
out
of
state
court,
which,
by
the
way,
are
very
used
to
dealing
with
all
kinds
of
litigation,
but
nonetheless
are
brought
into
federal
court
for
consolidation
purposes,
and
yet
nonetheless
congress
would
have
wanted
to
let
those
cases
proliferate
in
the
tribal
courts.
that's
where
i'm
having
difficulty.
once
you
say
that
you
want...
congress
really
wanted
them
out
of
state
court
into
federal
court,
i
can't
find
a
good,
convincing
reason
why
they
would
have
wanted
them
to
stay
in
the
tribal
court.
that's
why
i'm
asking
the
same
question.
unknown
speaker
do
you
think,
mr.
farr,
that
was
a
deliberate
decision
by
congress
not
to
allow
removal
from
tribal
courts,
or
do
you
think
they
just
overlooked
it
at
the
time
they
enacted
the
removal
statute?
unknown
speaker
generally,
because
you
make
the
general
point
that,
unlike
most
plaintiffs,
tribal
plaintiffs
don't
have
to
worry
about
the
defendant
removing
even
if
there's
diversity
jurisdiction.
unknown
speaker
which
proves
what,
which
proves
that
congress
did
not...
that
congress
thought
it
was
a
bad
idea?
unknown
speaker
it
doesn't.
unknown
speaker
so
that's--
--when
you
say,
injuries
on
tribal
lands,
what
particularly
was
the
allegation
of
the
complaint
here,
that
there
was
some
activity
of
the
defendants
on
tribal
lands?
unknown
speaker
mining
uranium,
or--
unknown
speaker
--wait,
i
can
put
you
on
easier
ground,
i
think,
and
i
think
you
may
have
this...
because
suppose
i
thought...
let's
assume
i
do
think
this,
which
i
think
i
do
basically,
that
if
congress
had
a
statute,
that
statute
says,
look,
this
is
a
certain
kind
of
action,
we
do
not
want
this
ever
brought
in
a
state
court.
we
want
this
brought
in
federal
court
no
matter
what.
never,
never,
never
bring
it
in
a
state
court,
and
they
simply
happen
to
forget
saying,
and
by
the
way,
we
mean
tribal
courts,
too.
if
i
saw
a
statute
like
that,
it
wouldn't
take
me
long
to
say,
they
want
it
brought
in
federal
court,
period.
they
just
forgot
about
tribal
courts,
or
didn't
mention
it.
but
that
isn't
our
case,
because
our
case
is
a
case
where
there's
one
set
of
things
that
fall
within
the
statute
that
we'll
imagine
says
that,
but
the
question,
i
take
it,
here
is,
and
if
you
have
some
instances
where
it
isn't
clear
whether
you
have
this
kind
of
an
action
or
not
this
kind
of
an
action,
who's
to
decide
that?
unknown
speaker
and
so
what's
your
argument
there?
assume
with
me,
in
other
words,
contrary
to
your
interests,
that
in
the
clear
case,
a
price-anderson
case,
that's
the
district
court's
position.
you
have
something
everybody
agrees
in
the
price-anderson
act,
it
goes
to
federal
court.
you
have
something
that
there's
disagreement
about
whether
it
goes
to
tribal...
whether
it's
in
the
price-anderson
act
or
not,
as
to
that
one
the
question
is,
who
is
to
decide
whether
it's
within
or
without,
and
on
that
question
you
say
go
to
tribal
court.
unknown
speaker
the
sg
disagrees
with
you.
the
sg
says
that
will
wreck
the
act.
that
will
wreck
the
act
on
the
assumption
that
i'm
talking
about,
that
you
say,
and
that's
my
question.
unknown
speaker
well,
that
would
be
the
same
thing
in
a
state
court
situation.
if
the
mining
occurred
on...
in
the
jurisdiction
of
the
state,
not
tribal
law,
one
would
normally
let
the
state
courts
decide
that,
if
that's
where
the
plaintiff
sued.
unknown
speaker
but
congress
has
said
no,
has
provided
for
removal,
right?
unknown
speaker
and
here,
no
similar
language
is
included
for
removal
from
tribal
courts.
unknown
speaker
so
we
have
to
figure
out
what
to
do
in
the
absence
of
such
language.
unknown
speaker
we
do
have
those
cases.
i
mean,
there
they
are.
unknown
speaker
we've
done
it
in
other
areas,
and
you're
saying
it's
shocking
here.
i
mean,
what's
the
difference?
i
mean,
the
argument
you're
making
is
an
argument
against
all
of
the
cases
which
say
that
you
have
a
1331
cause
of
action
to
get
it
out
of
the
tribal
court.
unknown
speaker
but
don't
make
a
comparison
to
how
we
treat
state
courts,
because
you
couldn't
have
a
1331
action
to
yank
a
case
out
of
a
state
court
that
way,
could
you?
unknown
speaker
but
the
1331
cause
of
action
isn't
yet
filled
in.
i
mean,
it's
entirely
made
by
this
court,
really.
granted,
1331
provides
the
basis
for
it,
but
congress
might
well
have
thought
that
that
is
the,
you
know,
adequate
substitute
for
removal.
unknown
speaker
but,
of
course,
the
reason
the
tribal
court
lacks
jurisdiction,
if
it
does,
is
because
congress
has
said
all
these
cases
belong
in
federal
court.
unknown
speaker
if
the
defendant
wants
them
there.
unknown
speaker
mr.
farr--
unknown
speaker
--i
think
there
is
something
different,
and
that's
what
i'd
like
to
get
down
to.
i
understand
talking
in
these
abstract
categories,
but
you
have
conceded,
if
i
read
your
brief
correctly,
that
if
the
tribal
court
plaintiffs
claims
are,
indeed,
as
mr.
atwood
tells
us
they
are,
public
liability
claims,
they
cannot
survive
as
something
else.
if
the
price-anderson
covers
the
waterfront,
you
cannot
characterize
it
as
something
else.
i
believe
that
you
have
said
that
a
few
times
in
your
brief.
unknown
speaker
so
if
the
question
is,
how
sweeping
is
the
price-anderson
act,
does
it
cover
mining,
does
it
cover
situations
where
there's
no
indemnification,
why
isn't
it
logical
that
a
federal
court
should
decide
that
purely
federal
question?
if
we
look
at
the
farmers
and
laplante,
there
were
some
things
that
involved,
maybe
fact
determination,
maybe
some
input
from
tribal
law,
but
here,
the
question
is,
the
sweep
of
the
price-anderson
act
has
nothing
to
do
with
anything
other
than
how
broad
congress
wanted
to
make
that,
and
so
why
should
the
exhaustion
requirement
apply
to
a
question
of
what
is
the
scope
of
a
law
passed
by
congress
to
govern
nuclear
incidents?
unknown
speaker
but
you
can't
get
all
the
way
there
just
from
farmers
and
laplante,
because,
as
the
chief
pointed
out,
those
were
decisions
not...
where
we
weren't
guided
by
anything
congress
said.
the
court
essentially
created
that.
unknown
speaker
but
that
wasn't
appealed,
was
it?
unknown
speaker
oh,
but
they're
all
categorical,
whether
it's
based
on
jurisdiction
or
not.
what
they
say
is...
and
they're
certainly
as
categorical
as
morley
was,
which
was...
i
mean,
it
couldn't
have
been
more
categorical.
unknown
speaker
langes
doesn't
deal
with
the
issue.
langes,
its
discussion
of
this
issue
is
dictum,
because
what
was
involved
was
in
fact
not
the
failure
to
raise
an
issue,
but
the
failure
to
make
an
argument.
it
wasn't--
unknown
speaker
--so
anything
it
said
was
dictum,
and
it
has
dictum
on
both
sides.
as
i
read
our
prior
cases,
they
are
all
categorical
when
they
say
that
you
simply
can't
do
it.
unknown
speaker
i
don't
know,
but
we've
said
so.
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
we
have
a
case
in
point,
like
morley.
certainly
one
thing
about
jurisdiction,
it
ought
to
be
clear.
it
ought
not
to
have
a
lot
of...
you
know,
somebody
we
feel
sorry
for
and
make
a
little
exception
to
it.
certainly
morley
is
dead
against
you
in
this
case.
unknown
speaker
well,
why
not
just
cross-appeal
when
in
doubt?
unknown
speaker
you
said
petitioners.
you
mean
respondents.
unknown
speaker
why
do
you
care?
i
mean,
you
have
nothing
in
the
complaint,
or
virtually
nothing
that
alleges
violation
of
price-anderson.
i
mean,
almost
all
your...
i
thought
all
of
them,
but
maybe
there's
one
that
isn't...
that
you
seem
to
allege
things
like
negligence,
et
cetera,
which
you're
saying
don't
fall
within
price-anderson.
unknown
speaker
so
why
do
you
care?
unknown
speaker
you
want
to
say
even
if
they
were.
okay.
i
see
that.
let
me...
can
i
ask
you
one
other
question?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
could
you
say
one
word
on
that,
just
what...
i
mean,
i
just
don't
want
you
to
sit
down
without
saying
one
other
thing.
i'll
put
it
specifically
so
you
have
a
chance
to
say
it,
but
that
the...
you
look
at
the
price-anderson
act
and
it
says,
with
respect
to
any
public
liability
action
resulting
from
a
nuclear
incident,
federal
courts
have
jurisdiction.
then
it
defines
a
public
liability
action
really
to
be
any
action
where
somebody
is
claimed
to
owe
money
to
a
member
of
the
public
arising
out
of
a
nuclear
incident.
then
it
defines
nuclear
incident
to
mean
any
occurrence
that
causes
sickness
or
death
or
injury
arising
from
the
radioactive
properties
of
nuclear
material.
well,
qed.
what
is
there
for
them
to
decide
if
we
send
it
back?
what
they're
saying
is,
qed.
all
the
claims
in
this
complaint
are
price-anderson
claims,
because
they
all
allege
injury
arising...
to
a
member
of
the
public
arising
out
of
radioactive
material.
end
of
the
matter.
now,
what's
your
response
to
that?
unknown
speaker
public
liability
meaning
liability
to
a
human
being,
namely,
a
member
of
the
public.
unknown
speaker
all
right,
so
why
don't
we
say
that?
if
you
put
it
in
that
language,
what's
the
problem?
unknown
speaker
well,
they're
saying
there
is
a
defendant
here.
they
say,
the
el
paso
natural
gas
company
is
liable
to
me,
a
member
of
the
public.
unknown
speaker
mr.
farr,
do
you
argue...
i
just
want
to
be
sure
i
get
this
question
in.
do
you
challenge
the
fact
that
there's
a
nuclear
incident
alleged?
unknown
speaker
i
understand
your
argument
about
the
public
liability
action,
but--
unknown
speaker
--but
you're
saying
that
even
if
one
assumes
it's
a
nuclear
incident.
unknown
speaker
those
are
the
questions
about
the
scope
of
price-anderson,
and
the
question
before
us
is,
who
decides,
and
the
very
good
argument
that
you
are
making
now,
you're
saying
should
be
addressed
in
the
first
instance
to
a
tribal
court
and
not
to
a
federal
court.
unknown
speaker
even
though
it's
a
very
intricate
question
of
federal
statutory
interpretation,
and
has
no...
that
part
of
it
has
no
tribal
law
element
to
it
at
all.
unknown
speaker
the
honorable
court
is
now
adjourned
until
tomorrow
at
ten
o'clock.
