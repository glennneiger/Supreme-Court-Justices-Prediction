mr.
james
r.
atwood
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
two
consolidated
courses...
cases
here
arose
from
uranium
mining
and
milling
activity
that
occurred
on
the
navajo
reservation
some
40
years
ago.
the
petitioners
or
their
predecessors
produced
this
uranium
under
licenses
and
contracts
with
the
atomic
energy
commission
and
sold
it
to
the
government
under
the
government's
uranium
procurement
program.
all
of
the
uranium
was
used
for
military
purposes.
some
decades
after
the
uranium
operations
closed
down,
my
clients
were
sued
in
navajo
tribal
court
by
the
respondents.
the
respondents
are
members
of
the
navajo
tribe,
and
they
claim
that
from
long-term
exposure
to
uranium
and
other
hazardous
properties
produced
by
the
petitioners'
operations,
they
suffered
injury.
the
claims
in
tribal
court
were
pleaded
entirely
under
tribal
law.
it
is
our
basic
contention
in
this
case
that
claims
of
nuclear
tort
such
as
those
raised
by
respondents
must
be
heard
under
federal
law
and
that,
under
the
relevant
federal
law,
the
defendants
are
entitled
to
a
federal
forum.
congress
visited
this
issue
of
nuclear
torts
on
more
than
a
half-dozen
occasions
over
the
last
40
years,
and
in
the
atomic
energy
act
itself,
in
the
price-anderson
provisions
of
the
atomic
energy
act,
congress
developed
a
rather
elaborate
set
of
procedural
and
substantive
rules
to
govern
how
nuclear
torts
should
be
treated.
and
these
rules
reflect
a
legislative
judgment
on
how
to
balance
the
public's
need
for
safety,
the
public's
need
for
compensation
if
safety
is
lacking,
on
the
one
hand,
and
the
national
need
for
a
domestic
uranium
industry
that
is
not
subject
to
uncontrolled,
unstructured
tort
liability.
mr.
james
r.
atwood
correct.
mr.
james
r.
atwood
claims
under
tribal
law
could,
yes.
mr.
james
r.
atwood
by
petitioners.
mr.
james
r.
atwood
as
well
as
a
question
that
was
appealed,
that's
correct.
mr.
james
r.
atwood
no.
we
would
certainly
hope--
mr.
james
r.
atwood
--i...
we
agree
the
court
should
vacate
that
portion
of
the
court
of
appeals
decision
that
allowed
price-anderson
cases
to
proceed
in
tribal
court
because
in
our
view--
mr.
james
r.
atwood
--that
issue
was
not
appealed.
mr.
james
r.
atwood
that's
correct.
but
what
was
appealed,
and
which
is
therefore
proper...
the
court
had
jurisdiction
over,
and
this
court
has
jurisdiction,
over
the
question
whether
the
tribal
law
claims
could
properly
proceed.
mr.
james
r.
atwood
it
affirmed
the
denial
of
a
preliminary
injunction
that
we
requested.
it...
so
its
order
does
allow,
incorrectly,
in
our
view,
the
tribal
law
claims
to
proceed
in
tribal
court.
that
issue
was
properly
before
the
court
of
appeals
jurisdictionally.
they
decided
it
wrongly.
mr.
james
r.
atwood
no,
it...
it
decided
two
issues.
it
affirmed
the
denial
of
the
injunction
that
we
sought,
and
it
reversed
sua
sponte
the
grant
of
the
other
part
of
the
injunction
that
we
sought.
so
there's
clearly
one
very
important
substantive
issue
that
came
up
properly
jurisdictionally,
and
that
is
the
question,
were
the
tribal
law
claims
preempted
by
the
price-anderson
act.
mr.
james
r.
atwood
right.
mr.
james
r.
atwood
well,
there...
i
think
there
is
a
distinction
between
what
orders
were
before
the
court
and
what
orders
are
before
this
court,
and
therefore
what
the
relief
should
be,
with
the
question
of
how
broad
the
analysis
needs
to
be
to
properly
decide
the
issues
that
are
before
the
court.
and
it
is
perfectly
understandable,
i
think,
that
the
ninth
circuit
and
this
court,
in
deciding
the
preemption
issues
that
are
presented,
would
want
to
analyze
the
totality
of
the
relationship
of
the
price-anderson
act
regime
with
what
has
happened
in
this
case.
so
it
is
certainly
possible
that
the
substantive
analysis
would
be
somewhat
broad,
but
then
when
you
get
down
to
an
appropriate
relief,
in
our
judgment
it
should
be
to
reverse
the
court
of
appeals
insofar
as
it
allowed
the
tribal
court
causes
of
action
to
go
forward
and
to
vacate
the
court
of
appeals
judgment
insofar
as
it
prohibited
price-anderson
claims
from
going
forward.
we--
mr.
james
r.
atwood
--yes,
the...
right.
mr.
james
r.
atwood
well,
there
certainly
are
differences,
though,
substantively,
in
how
a
tribal
law
claim
would
proceed
and
how
a
price-anderson
claim
would
proceed.
also,
let
me
say
we're
not--
mr.
james
r.
atwood
--yes,
i'd
be
happy
to.
well,
assuming
you
could
have
a
price-anderson
claim
in
tribal
court?
mr.
james
r.
atwood
which
we
don't
think
you
can
have.
mr.
james
r.
atwood
if
there
could
be
price-anderson
claims
in
tribal
court,
again
which
we
do
not
agree
with,
federal
standards
of
care
would
be
relevant.
in
other
cases,
not
this
one,
there
would
be
indemnity
issues
that
would
be
relevant.
mr.
james
r.
atwood
not...
no.
they
are
not...
indeed,
you
would
not
borrow
tribal
law
under
price-anderson.
you
would
borrow
state
law.
mr.
james
r.
atwood
arizona
law
would
apply
in
tribal
court,
not
tribal
law.
mr.
james
r.
atwood
if
price-anderson
claims
were
properly
held
in
tribal
court,
that
would
be
a
judgment
the
tribal
court
would
have
to
reach.
we
do
not
think
tribal
courts--
mr.
james
r.
atwood
--do
have
authority,
and
we're
not--
mr.
james
r.
atwood
--and
it
may
be
that
what
is
necessary
because
of
the
procedural
errors
of
the
ninth
circuit...
we're
not
opposed
to
this
court
deciding
all
the
substantive
issues
it
feels
it
has
an
adequate
record
for.
we're
not
opposing
a
full
resolution
of
the
preemption
and
jurisdictional
issues,
but
we
did
think
it
was
necessary
to
bring
to
the
court's
attention
what
we
perceive
to
be
a
jurisdictional
error
in
the
court
of
appeals,
and
that
obviously
can
have
implications
for
the
scope
of
the
ruling
of
this
case.
mr.
james
r.
atwood
it
is
a
preliminary
injunction.
mr.
james
r.
atwood
that's
right.
mr.
james
r.
atwood
and
respondents
make
the
point
that
the
issue
would
come
back
up
to
the
court
of
appeals
eventually
on
a
permanent
injunction.
that's
absolutely
right,
but
i...
you
know,
we
do
think
it
is
a
matter
of
concern
that
the
court
of
appeals
felt
it
had
the
authority
to
reach
down
and
take...
and
rule
upon,
and
indeed
rule
upon
it
incorrectly,
an
order
that
wasn't
before
it.
mr.
james
r.
atwood
well,
and
also
it
depends
on
what
the--
mr.
james
r.
atwood
--and
what
the
respondents
want
to
do.
they
have
so
far,
at
least
up
until
this
phase
of
the
litigation,
eschewed
price-anderson
claims.
they
were
very
clear
in
saying,
we
want
to
proceed
solely
under
tribal
law,
we're
not
interested
in
pursuing
under
price-anderson,
and
they
demonstrated
that
by
not
appealing
the
injunction
against
proceeding
under
price-anderson,
so
we
are
dealing
with
potential
future
events.
but
it
does
seem
to
us
clear
under
the
statute
that
price-anderson
preempts
the
tribal
law
claims.
the
congressional
language
is
absolute
in
saying,
any
claim
for
nuclear
torts
such
as
this
may
be
brought
only
under
the
terms
of
price-anderson,
and
four
courts
of
appeals
have
all
decided
that
that
language
preempts
state
law
claims.
and
now,
indeed,
for
the
first
time
in
this
court,
respondents
concede
that
it
preempts
tribal
law
claims,
and
they
now
are
arguing
something
a
little
different.
they're
saying
their
claims
are
not
price-anderson
because
they
involve
mining
and
because
there's
no
indemnification
agreement.
we
don't
think
those
arguments
were
properly
preserved,
but
we
also
think,
as
does
the
solicitor
general,
that
they
are
clearly
wrong.
mr.
james
r.
atwood
in
fact,
the
mining
issue
wasn't
even
raised
with
the
ninth
circuit.
the
indemnification
issue
was,
but
not
decided.
mr.
james
r.
atwood
right.
mr.
james
r.
atwood
they
did
not.
mr.
james
r.
atwood
in
part.
mr.
james
r.
atwood
well,
i
think
what
that--
mr.
james
r.
atwood
--right.
mr.
james
r.
atwood
but
justice
breyer,
i
think
there
was
an
injunction
issued--
mr.
james
r.
atwood
--yes.
mr.
james
r.
atwood
and
we
were
required...
we
posted
a
bond,
so
all
the
elements
of
the
normal
preliminary
injunction.
i
think...
it
is
true
they
were
not
then
seeking,
but
that
is
an
injunction
against
an
effort
for
them
to
try
to
convert
tribal
law
claims
under
price-anderson.
mr.
james
r.
atwood
well,
but...
no,
that
leaves
out
a
series
of
important
errors
that
the
court
of
appeals
made
with
respect
to
the
injunction
that
did
not
issue.
they
concluded
that
it
was
necessary
for
us
to
exhaust
tribal
remedies
on
the
question
of
whether
or
not
tribal
law
claims
were
proper,
and
that's
where
we
and
the
united
states
strongly
disagree.
price-anderson
clearly
preempts
those
claims,
and
with
respect
to
those
claims
there
should
be
no
exhaustion
requirement
because
it
would
be
very
wasteful
and
it
would
frustrate
this
congressional
scheme
of
having
price-anderson
nuclear
tort
claims,
that
is,
all
of
which
must
be
price-anderson
claims,
handled
in
a
coordinated,
operative
fashion,
so
that's
a
critical
element
of
the
court
of
appeals
decision.
mr.
james
r.
atwood
but...
that's
correct,
but
it
is
clear
that
on
the
face
of
what
they
allege,
those
are
price-anderson
claims.
they
are
claiming
injury
from
radioactive
consequences
of
uranium,
uranium--
mr.
james
r.
atwood
--well,
it
is--
mr.
james
r.
atwood
--yes.
mr.
james
r.
atwood
one
option
available
to
this
court
is
to
tell
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals,
you
should
address
the
substance
of
the
preemption
argument,
that
your
decision
on
exhaustion
was
wrong.
you
should
not
require
6
years
of
litigation
in
tribal
court
before
any
federal
judge
decides
the
preemption
issue.
you
should...
this
court
could
decide
the
issue,
or
it
could
remand
the
preemption
issue
and
simply
tell
the
court
of
appeals,
your
exhaustion
ruling
was
incorrect.
mr.
james
r.
atwood
that
was--
mr.
james
r.
atwood
--it
was
not
attempted
in
this
case.
there's
another
case
somewhat
predating
ours
in
tribal
court,
the
kerr-mcgee
case,
where
an
interlocutory
review
on
the
preemption
issue
was
sought
in
tribal
court.
it
was
denied,
so
the
judgment
of
these
people
was
it
was
futile,
and
as
the
solicitor
general
argues,
we
think
that
under
a
complete
preemption
statute,
that
preemption
issue
should
be
decided
by
the
federal
court,
not
by
the
tribal
court.
mr.
james
r.
atwood
it
was...
obviously
the
statute
is
silent.
it
was
not
addressed
anywhere
that
we've
seen
in
the
legislative
history,
but
i
think
the
answer
is,
you
don't
need
a
removal
provision
when
a
claim
is
improperly
brought
in
tribal
court,
because
you
have
available
under
the
national
farmers
union
case,
under
the
strate
holding,
you
have
available
a
federal
cause
of
action
under
1331
because
the
tribe
has
exceeded
its
authority.
you
don't
have--
mr.
james
r.
atwood
--farmers
says
you
can
sue
immediately
in
federal
court.
it
then
says
you
then
have
to
engage
in
an
analysis
of
whether
or
not
exhaustion
is
appropriate,
but
you
can
go
to
federal
court,
and
there
is
no
equivalent
to
28
u.s.c.
2283.
there's
no
anti-injunction
provision
that
acts,
that
prevents
the
federal
court
from
acting,
so
we
were
properly
before
federal
court.
there
is
the
relevant
question,
should
we
have
to
exhaust
first.
and
there
i
think
you
have
to
engage
in
the
kind
of
analysis
that
we
and
the
solicitor
general
do
as
to
what
is
the
prudential
rule
for
a
federal
cause
of
action
where
there
is
no
meaningful
role
for
the
tribe
to
play
in
informing
about
the
relevant
law.
we
think
in
that
situation
the
federal
court
should
decide
the
issue
before
it.
