mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
before
turning
to
the
jurisdictional
question
that
makes
this
case,
i
think,
particularly
perplexing
as
it
comes
to
this
court,
i
would
like
just
to
take
a
moment
at
the
outset
to
explain
why
i
think
the
decision
below,
assuming
for
a
moment
that
the
court
of
appeals
had
the
power
to
render
it,
was,
in
fact,
a
proper
accommodation
of
the
price-anderson
act
and
the
doctrine
of
tribal
exhaustion.
first
of
all,
the
decision
below
carried
forth
both
congress'
policy
of
respecting
the
jurisdiction
of
tribal
courts
and
also,
in
particular,
its
policy
of
allowing
tribal
plaintiffs
to
choose
tribal
courts
as
a
forum.
that
policy
is
reflected
in
the
absence
of
removal
provisions
generally
from
tribal
courts.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
i
mean
the
entire
decision
below,
in
fact.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
that's
correct.
i
think
the
court
of
appeals...
and
i
will
obviously
get
to
the
point
of
whether
it
had
the
power
to
render
it,
but
i
think
in
fact
by
addressing
both
the
unappealed
part
of
the
order
and
the
appealed
part
of
the
order
the
ninth
circuit
came
out
in
the
right
place.
in
addition
to
this
respect
for
the
right
of
tribal
courts
and
tribal
plaintiffs,
what
the
court
did
was
avoid
the
problem
of
having
litigants
running
back
and
forth
between
the
federal
and
the
tribal
courts,
which
is
a
central
idea
behind
the
idea--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
--i'm
sorry.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
that
would
be
true,
but
the
fact
is
that
the
tribal
exhaustion
doctrine
in
its
basic
core
element
is
intended
to
say,
unless
there
is
a
clear
lack
of
jurisdiction
in
the
tribal
courts,
the
idea
is
that
the
issues
with
respect
to
jurisdiction
are
considered
first
by
the
tribal
court
and
then
subsequently
by
the
federal
court,
and
that's
exactly
the
regime
that
the
ninth
circuit
decision
restores
in
this
case.
at
the
end
of
the
district
court
proceedings,
essentially
you
had
a
case
that
was
half
in
federal
court
with
the
issue
that
petitioners
were
appealing
being
left
essentially
to
the
tribal
courts,
and
half
in
federal
court
with
the
issue
that
the
respondents
did
not
appeal
being
part
of
the
federal
decision-making.
so
in
the
end
it
seems
to
me
that,
confronted
with
a
split
case,
the
ninth
circuit
did
what
would
make
the
most
sense,
assuming
it
had
the
power
to
do
it,
which
is
to
say,
let's
let
the
tribal
courts
decide
both
of
these
issues
in
the
first
place.
and
one
particular
point
i
think
that
bears
on
that
is
that
if,
in
fact,
the
district
court
is
incorrect
that
tribal
courts
lack
power
over
price-anderson
actions,
then,
in
fact,
the
other
question,
the
question
that
petitioners
were
asking
the
ninth
circuit
to
consider,
is
irrelevant
to
jurisdiction.
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
whether
this
is
a
public
liability
action
or
not
for
purposes
of
determining
tribal
court
jurisdiction,
if,
in
fact,
tribal
courts
have
a
jurisdiction,
whether
it
is
or
not.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
justice
breyer,
i
think
we
have
to
look
at
two
things.
the
first
is
that
tribal
court
jurisdiction
by
its
nature
is
very
limited.
it
only
arises
in
situations
in
which
there
are
activities
on
tribal
land,
with
very
few
exceptions,
activities
that
arise
on
tribal
land
that
injure
tribal
members,
or
perhaps
in
certain
cases
where
non-indians
essentially
are
required
to
bring
their
suits
under
williams
v.
lee.
but
the
basic
idea
is
that
tribal
courts
only
have
jurisdiction
in
a
very
narrow
territorial
area,
and
of
course
there
aren't
any
nuclear
power
plants
on
tribal--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
--right,
but
that
i
think
would
not
be
a
case
that's
subject
to
tribal
court
jurisdiction,
because
in
fact--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
--the
activity
did
not
occur
on
the
tribal
reservation,
so--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
--i
understand,
but
i
think--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
--this
is
why
i
think
the
example
does
make
a
difference.
the
general
practice
of
congress
is
to
allow
tribal
plaintiffs
to
choose
the
tribal
court
forum
for
events
that
arise
on
tribal
lands,
so
if
you
look
at
any
of
the
other
cases
in
which
there
are
federal
jurisdiction,
federal
question
jurisdiction
under
section
1331,
diversity
jurisdiction
situations
in
which
the
same
argument
could
be
made
that
congress
has
provided
for
removal
from
state
courts,
congress
in
fact
has
not
provided--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
--in
the
price-anderson
act
specifically,
or
generally?
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
that's
right.
i'm
not
sure
that
the
decision
at
first
was
deliberate,
justice
stevens.
but
i
think
that
by
now
the
idea
that
cases
are
not
removable
from
tribal
court
is
a
familiar
principle,
and
certainly
congress
has
not
revisited
that.
and
also
in
the
most
specific
example
that
we
have,
after
a
federal
court
of
appeals
held
that
a
suit
against
a
federal
officer
in
tribal
court
was
not
removable,
the
justice
department
asked
the
congress,
in
fact,
to
amend
the
removal
statute
to
provide...
that
would
be
1442...
to
provide
for
removal
in
those
cases,
and
congress
did
not
enact
it,
so
i
think
the
idea
that
congress--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
--it
doesn't
necessarily
prove
that.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
what
i'm
suggesting,
though,
is
that
congress
seems,
by
not
providing
in
any
situation
for
removal
from
tribal
court,
in
the
end
to
be
suggesting
a
special
solicitude
for
tribal
plaintiffs
to
choose
tribal
courts
as
their
forum.
congress
has
demonstrated
a
concern
for
the
tribal
courts
themselves,
of
course,
and
then
in
addition
to
that
it
seems
to
me
that
in
the
cases
where
you
have
injuries
arising
on
tribal
lands,
and
the
injured
parties
are
tribal
members,
that
congress
reasonably
would
think,
consistent
with
that
policy,
that
those
suits
should
be
brought
in
tribal
court.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
that's
correct.
the
defendants
in
these
cases
were
on
tribal
lands.
these
are
lands
that
are
owned
in
trust
for
the
tribes.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
that's
correct.
in
one...
in
both
cases
they
are
open
pit
uranium
mines.
in
one
situation,
the
injuries
are
said
to
arise
from
the...
essentially
the
abandonment
of
the
pits,
and
they're
filling
up
with
water,
and
then
families
using
the
water
as
drinking
water
and
other...
for
other
reasons
which
caused
injury.
in
the
other,
it's
a
situation
essentially
of
particulate
in
the
air
as
a
result
of
the
mining
operations.
but
all
of
this
occurs
on
tribal
land
in
essentially
the
core
part
of
the
navajo
reservation,
so
back
to
justice
breyer's
question
for
a
moment.
first
of
all,
i
begin
with
the
proposition
then
that
congress
has
generally
allowed
tribal
plaintiffs--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
--well,
that's
true,
and--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
--that
would
still
be
in
the
tribal
court.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
well,
i
don't
think
it
will,
your
honor,
for
several
reasons.
first
of
all,
it
only
wrecks
the
act
on
the
assumption
that
the
answer
to
the
question
is
that
the
claim
is
a
price-anderson
claim,
which
we
think
is,
in
fact,
the
wrong
answer
to
that
question.
but
secondly,
the
fact
is
that
the
tribal
exhaustion
doctrine
is
not
some
novel
principle.
the
tribal
exhaustion
doctrine
is
basically
a
representation
of
the
usual
principle
of
comity
that
says,
when
you
have
a
pending
proceeding
in
another
court,
it's
not
the
business
of
the
federal
court
to
jump
in
and
tell
that
court
it
can't
adjudicate
the--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
--that's
correct,
justice
o'connor.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
that's
correct.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
correct.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
that's
correct,
but
the
point
that
i'm
making,
and
back
again
to
justice
breyer's
question,
is
that
it
seems
to
me
instructive
that
the
failure
to
provide
for
removal
from
tribal
courts
in
this
case
is
not
an
exception
to
the
congress'
normal
practice
of
providing
for
removal
from
tribal
courts.
to
the
contrary.
if,
in
fact,
one
thought
removal
was
necessary
in
this
case,
either
directly
or
through
some
sort
of
second-hand
removal
creation
by
a
combination
of
the
1331
lawsuit,
that
would
be
the
first
time,
in
fact,
that
it
was
ever
attributed
to
congress
an
intention
to
allow
a
defendant
to
remove
a
case
that
was
otherwise
properly,
under
all
principles
of
federal
indian
law,
within
the
jurisdiction
of
the
tribal
court.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
well--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
--no,
i'm
not
arguing
that
there
isn't
a
cause
of
action.
what
i'm
suggesting,
though,
is
that
the
second
part
of
the
national
farmers
decision
is
that
even
though
there
is
jurisdiction
under
1331,
essentially
it's
not
exercised
unless
the
lack
of
jurisdiction
in
the
tribal
court
is
clear.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
no,
you
could
not,
but
what
i'm
suggesting,
it's
not
a...
it's
not
the
difference
between
the
way
this
court
treats
state
courts,
it's
the
way
the
congress
treats
removal
from
state
courts
and
tribal
courts.
it
provides
generally
for
removal
from
state
courts.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
well,
i
think
in
a
situation
where
it
was
clear
that
the
tribal
court
did
not
have
jurisdiction,
that
it
would
properly
serve
through
a
lawsuit
brought
under
1331
an
injunctive
power
to
bring
the
case,
at
least
foreclose
it
in
tribal
court,
if
not
bring
it
into
federal
court.
the
1331
action,
of
course,
is
a
different
action
from
what
you
get
with
a
removal
petition.
if
you
file
a
removal
petition,
what
the
federal
court
is
asked
to
decide
is
its
own
jurisdiction,
does
it
have
jurisdiction
over
this
claim,
and
the
question
will
be
whether
it
arises
under
federal
law.
complete
preemption
principles
may
be
relevant
to
that.
but
here
the
question
is
not,
does
the
federal
court
have
jurisdiction
over
this
case.
it's
whether
the
tribal
court
lacks
jurisdiction
over
the
case,
and
that...
an
order
that
precedes
that
says,
to--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
--well,
to
begin
with,
congress
has
not
said
that
they
all
belong
in
federal
court
as
such.
they
certainly
may
remain
in
state
court.
at
most--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
--at
most
what
congress
would
have
said
is,
if
the
defendant
wants
them
there,
and
the
point
i'm
making
about
the
lack
of
provision
for
removal
from
tribal
courts
generally
is
that
that's
exactly
what
all
removal
statutes
do.
all
removal
statutes
say,
if
it's
a
federal
question
case,
and
the
defendant
wants
it
in
federal
court,
it
goes
to
federal
court.
if
it's
a
diversity
case
and
it
meets
the
requirements,
the
defendant
wants
it
in
federal
court,
it
goes
to
federal
court.
what's
different
about
the
price-anderson
act?
that's
all--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
--that's
all
they're
pointing
to
here.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
that's
correct.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
i
think
the
answer
to
that,
justice
goldburg,
goes
back
to
the
basic
idea
why
the
exhaustion
doctrine
exists
at
all.
i
do
not
think
that
it
is
necessary
that
the
issue
that
is...
the
jurisdictional
issue
that
is
part
of
exhaustion
be
one
that
tribal
courts
have
particular
expertise
with
regard
to.
i
think
it
is
sufficient
to
justify
the
tribal
exhaustion
doctrine
under
traditional
principles
of
comity
that
the
suit
was
originally
filed
in
tribal
court,
and
the
tribal
court
has
asserted
jurisdiction
over
it.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
i'm
not
saying
that
those
decisions
necessarily
foreclose
any
evolution,
essentially,
in
the
1331
cause
of
action.
what
i'm
saying
is
that
i
think
the
proper
application
of
the
tribal
exhaustion
doctrine
is
essentially
to
leave
matters
affecting
the
jurisdiction
of
a
tribal
court
to
the
tribal
court
in
the
first
instance
when
there
is
a
pending
tribal
court
proceeding.
and
what
is
being
asked
in
the
1331
proceeding
is
that
a
federal
court
take
the
highly
unusual
step
of
declaring
that
another
court
lacks
jurisdiction
over
the
claims
it's
presently
hearing.
it
seems
to
me
that,
unless
that
lack
of
jurisdiction
in
the
tribal
court
is
clear,
then
federal
courts
are
really
overstepping
the
proper
bounds
of
injunctive
power
under
usual
principles
of
comity.
also,
it
does
seem
to
me
that
one
runs
the
risk
of
having
just
what
you
have
here.
as
justice
kennedy
pointed
out
earlier,
you
essentially
have
a
case
which
then
goes
up
to
a
court
of
appeals
essentially
in
a
mixed
condition,
because
in
our
view
the
district
court
should
not
have
decided
that
tribal
jurisdiction
is
foreclosed
over...
under
public
liability
actions.
we
think
under
a
proper
demonstration
of
the
principles
of
national
farmers,
that
question
was
also
properly
left
to
the
tribal
court.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
that
was
not
appealed,
and
let
me
just
say
for
one
moment,
i
actually
think
that
the
court
of
appeals
did
have
jurisdiction
to
consider
the
unappealed
part
of
the
order
and
to
reverse
that
part.
that
is
a
jurisdiction
that
should
be
sparingly
exercised,
but
i
think
the
usual
principles
that
say,
once
a
court
acquires
jurisdiction
independently
over
a
part
of
a
case,
it
then
has
jurisdiction
over
the
entire
case,
and
the
power
to
dispose
of
the
entire
case
is
essentially
the
controlling
principle
here.
the
decision
in
morley
is,
i
think,
probably
the
biggest
obstacle
to
that
point,
but
i
think
there
are
a
couple
of
responses
to
that.
first
of
all,
if
one
looks
at
the
cases
cited
in
morley,
although
morley
itself
certainly
talks
in
terms
of
power,
a
number
of
the
cases
talk
in
terms
of
waiver,
or
something
amounting
to
a
waiver,
or
a
loss
of
the
right
to
insist
on
the
appeal,
language
which
suggests
really
more
about
the
loss
of
a
litigant's
right
to
insist
upon
a
decision
and
less...
goes
less
to
the
question
of
the
power
of
the
court.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
well,
to
begin
with,
the
case
that
deals
with
the
issue
most
directly,
langes,
is
categorical
the
other
way.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
right.
i
understand
it's
dictum.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
well,
but
the
question
is,
are
they
saying
you
can't
do
it
because
you
lack
the
power
to
do
so?
if
so,
those
cases,
it
seems
to
me,
have
not
explained
the
answer
to
the
point
i
just
made.
if
courts
generally
can
exercise
pendent
jurisdiction,
ancillary
jurisdiction,
supplemental,
whatever
the
right
term
is,
over
parts
of
a
case
over
which
there
is
no
independent
basis
of
jurisdiction,
once
it
does
have
a
basis
of
jurisdiction
over
the
initial
part
of
the
case,
what
is
there
that
is
so
different
about
the
notion
of
a
cross-appeal
that
would
take
it
out
of
that
rule?
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
i
don't
think
that
one
has
said
so
as
a
matter
of
binding
authority.
i
don't
think
that--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
--well,
let
me
suggest
two
things
if
i
may,
mr.
chief
justice.
first
of
all,
while
i
don't
generally
dispute
the
idea
that
jurisdictional
rules
ought
to
be
clear,
one
of
the
difficulties
is,
in
fact,
that
the
more
rigorous
the
cross-appeal
becomes,
the
more
difficult,
in
fact,
it
is
for
litigants,
because
they
wind
up
being
unsure
of
what
issues
they
can
in
fact
raise
in
defense
of
the
parts
of
the
case
that
they
won
below
and,
indeed--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
--well,
that
is
a
possible
solution
to
the
rule,
but
i
think...
in
the
first
place
i
don't
think
litigants
typically...
for
example,
this
case
is
not
a
bad
example.
as
a
result
of
the
injunction
against
petitioners,
they
were
not
able
to
proceed
with
claims
deemed
to
be
price-anderson
in
tribal
courts,
but
at
the
time,
none
of
the
claims
that
they
had
brought
in
tribal
court
had
yet
been
deemed
to
be--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
--i'm
sorry.
excuse
me.
i
do
mean
respondents.
none
of
the
claims
that
they
had
brought
had
been
deemed
to
be
price-anderson
claims,
so
in
terms
of
a
practical
effect,
the
injunction
had
none
at
that
point.
it
was
a
preliminary
injunction.
it
was
subject
to
review
when
made
final,
so
in
fact
a
cross-appeal
here,
and
obviously
in
retrospect
it
would
have
been
much
wiser
to
have
taken
one,
but
a
cross-appeal
here
would
have
essentially
caused
them
to
go
up
to
the
court
of
appeals
and
complain
about
an
order
that
was
causing
them
no
immediate
harm.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
well,
i
think--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
--justice
breyer,
i
think
there
are
two
points,
and
i
think
it's
important
to
keep
them
clear.
our...
we
have
a
basic
position
which
is,
these
claims
are
simply
not
price-anderson
claims.
they
are
not
within
the
scope
of
the
claims--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
--but
may
i
make--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
--just
one
final
point.
i
think
if,
in
fact,
they
are
within
the
scope
of
price-anderson
claims,
then
i
think
there
is
a
little
bit
of
a
misunderstanding
about
what
the
effect
of
that
is.
i
don't
think
there
is
any
requirement
for
claims
to
be
price-anderson
claims,
that
they
be
pled
as
price-anderson
claims.
the
act
deems
them
to
be
price-anderson
claims
if
they're
within
the
terms
of
the
act.
we
say
they're
not,
but
if
they
are,
the
act,
by
its
own
force,
turns
them
into
price-anderson
claims.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
i
think
there
are
two
real
problems...
excuse
me...
with
reading
the
language
the
way
that
that
would,
frankly,
naturally
seem
to
be
read.
you
wind
up
with
two
linguistic
anomalies.
first
of
all,
you
wind
up
with,
under
petitioner's
reading,
a
public
liability
action
against
defendants,
who
are
not
liable
for
public
liability.
the
linchpin
of
a
public
liability
action
is
that
it
asserts
public
liability,
but
it
isn't
asserting
public
liability
against
anybody
who
is
responsible
for
public
liability
in
this
case.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
right.
that's
what--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
--but
it
has
to
be
public
liability...
the
liability
has
to
be
on
behalf
of
a
defendant
who
is
liable
for
public
liability.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
but
the
fact
is,
under
the
definition
of
persons
indemnified,
which
is
2014(t),
which
includes
all
persons
who
are
possibly
liable
for
public
liability,
there
has
to
be
an
indemnification
agreement
or
financial
protection
where
that
doesn't
apply.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
the...
in
general
i
think
not,
but
the
question
is--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
--reading
it
in...
the
language
as
it
moves
through
the
definitions
seems
to
lead
to
one
conclusion.
our
position
is,
if
it's
read
in
context,
you
cannot
come
to
the
conclusion
that
you
can
have
a
public
liability
suit
against
persons
who
aren't
liable
for
public
liability
and
furthermore--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
--that
would
still
be
our
position,
right.
and
our
second
point,
though,
which
also
goes
to
the
language,
is
that
the
claim
has
to...
is
deemed
to
arise
under
section
2210.
the
question
is,
what
is
there
in
section
2210
that
this
claim
arises
under?
section
2210
is
a
compensation
scheme
which
covers
public
liability,
it
channels
public
liability
to
those
persons
having
indemnification
and
in...
and
required
insurance,
and
then
it
provides
for
suits
to
recover
within
that
scheme.
that's
what
section
2210
does.
none
of
that
applies
here.
there's
no
required
insurance.
there's
no
indemnity
by
the
government.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
if
it's
jurisdictional
at
all--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
--regardless
of
the
fact
that
it
doesn't
have
a
tribal
court
element,
we
still
think
that
when
a
litigant
goes
into
federal
court
and
says,
stop
the
jurisdiction
that
is
being
exerted
by
this
other
court,
that
unless
the
lack
of
jurisdiction
in
that
other
court
is
clear
both
from
jurisdictional
and
from
substantive
provisions,
it
is
the
role
of
the
other
court
to
make
the
initial
determination
about
jurisdiction,
and
that's
all
we're
asking
here.
that
is
the
tribal
court
here
in
the
first
instance
that
is
subject
to
later
review
after
that
decision
has
been
made.
thank
you.
