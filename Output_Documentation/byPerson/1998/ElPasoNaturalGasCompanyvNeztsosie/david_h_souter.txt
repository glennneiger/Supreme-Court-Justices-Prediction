the
second
of
the
two
cases
that
i
have
to
announce
this
morning
is
el
paso
natural
gas
company
against
neztsosie,
no.98-6.
this
case
comes
to
us
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit.
the
respondents
laura
and
arlinda
neztsosie
and
zonnie
richards,
all
members
of
the
navajo
nation,
separately
sued
the
petitioners
el
paso
natural
gas
corporation
and
cyprus
foote
mineral
company
in
navajo
tribal
court.
they
alleged
that
they
have
been
injured
by
radiation
from
open
pit
mines
operated
by
the
petitioners.
the
companies,
the
petitioners,
then
brought
suit
in
united
states
district
court
to
block
the
claims
pending
against
them
in
tribal
court.
the
district
court
issued
an
injunction
that
said
that
"the
tribal
courts
could
not
hear
any
claims
that
fell
under
the
price-anderson
act,
a
federal
act
designed
in
part
to
transform
state
court
claims
relating
to
nuclear
accidents
into
federal
cases".
but
the
district
court
left
it
to
the
tribal
court
to
decide
whether
respondent's
actual
claims
were
infact
claims
under
the
price-anderson
act.
the
ninth
circuit
affirmed,
it
said
that
the
district
court
had
to
let
the
tribal
courts
decide
whether
respondent's
claims
fell
under
the
price-anderson
act,
and
the
ninth
circuit
then
added
that
it
was
vacating
the
district
court's
injunction
barring
the
tribal
court
from
hearing
the
price-anderson
claims.
in
a
unanimous
opinion
filed
today
with
the
clerk
of
court
we
vacate
and
remand.
we
first
note
that
in
respondent's
appeal
to
the
ninth
circuit
they
did
not
ask
it
to
vacate
the
injunction
against
the
tribal
courts.
it
is
a
well
established
rule
where
a
party
has
not
appealed
an
adverse
ruling
in
a
district
court
decision,
the
court
of
appeals
may
not
address
the
unappealed
ruling.
the
purpose
of
the
rule
is
to
protect
the
orderly
function
of
the
judicial
system
by
giving
opposing
parties
advance
notice
of
what
issues
will
be
litigated
on
appeal
and
allowing
the
unappealed
issues
to
remain
settled.
we
need
not
decide
whether
this
is
a
rule
of
practice
which
might
conceivably
have
exceptions
or
a
rule
of
jurisdiction
to
which
no
exception
can
be
made.
because
in
this
case
there
was
clearly
no
interest
sufficient
to
justify
any
exception,
we
therefore
reverse
the
court
of
appeals'
vacation
of
the
unappealed
portion
of
the
district
court's
injunction.
next
we
consider
whether
the
district
court
should
have
decided
itself
whether
respondent's
claim
were
in
fact
price-anderson
act
claims.
the
ninth
circuit
relied
on
a
doctrine
known
as
tribal
court
exhaustion
to
leave
that
determination
to
the
tribal
courts
in
the
first
instance.
the
idea
behind
this
doctrine
which
we
announced
in
national
farmers
union
insurance
versus
crow
tribe
and
iowa
mutual
versus
laplante,
is
that
as
a
prudential
matter
a
federal
court
should
normally
allow
the
tribal
court
system
to
decide
whether
it
has
jurisdiction
over
a
given
case,
before
the
federal
court
makes
its
decision
about
whether
the
tribal
court
indeed
has
jurisdiction.
we
hold,
however
that
this
doctrine
does
not
apply
in
the
special
circumstances
of
the
price-anderson
act.
the
price-anderson
act
converts
nuclear
accident
cases
brought
in
state
court
into
federal
cases,
without
requiring
the
federal
court
to
wait
for
the
state
court
system
to
decide
if
the
claims
belong
in
federal
court.
we
cannot
imagine
that
congress
intended
to
treat
nuclear
accident
claims
brought
in
tribal
court
differently,
by
requiring
them
to
go
through
the
tribal
court
system
before
deciding
whether
they
belong
in
federal
court.
the
purpose
of
the
price-anderson
act
is
to
encourage
the
speedy
and
efficient
resolution
of
nuclear
accident
cases
in
federal
court
and
this
purpose
applies
as
much
to
claims
originally
brought
in
tribal
court,
as
to
those
originating
in
state
court.
we
accordingly
vacate
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
with
instructions
to
remand
that
the
district
court
for
proceedings
consistent
with
our
opinion.
