mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
as
you
know,
in
this
case
there
are
two
questions
presented,
one
having
to
do
with
the
state
action
doctrine,
one
having
to
do
with
procedural
due
process.
and
although
my
clients
could
prevail
on
either
of
these
theories,
i'd
like
to
begin
by
urging
this
court
to
reach
both
of
these
questions.
certainly
the
court
has
authority
to
reach
both
because
even
if
the
private
insurance
companies
are
found
to...
not
to
be
state
actors
and,
thus,
to
have
no
further
liability
in
the
case,
there
do
remain
other
parties
in
the
case,
the
commonwealth
of
pennsylvania,
and
the
school
district
of
philadelphia,
and
they
are...
they
are
certainly
affected
by
the
due
process
holding
in
and
of
itself.
but
more
important--
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
--they
did
petition.
their
petitions
were
denied.
they
are,
of
course,
parties
in
this
court
pursuant
to
this
court's
rules.
more
important,
from
our
point
of
view,
is
the
effect
upon
the
system
in
pennsylvania
were
this
court
to
leave...
to
affirm
on
the
state
action
question
but
to
leave
the
due
process
holding
of
the
third
circuit
in
place.
there
is
a
single,
comprehensive,
integrated
workers'
compensation
system
in
pennsylvania
that
involves
both
government
employers
and
private
employers,
both
private
insurance
companies
and
a
government
insurance
company
with
exactly
the
same
rules
and
obligations
applying
to
all
of
them
and,
very
importantly,
with
risk
sharing
among
them
in
the
form
of
assessments
that
are...
that
are
put
into
a
fund
for
the
purpose
of
dealing
with
the...
with
the
risk
of
providing...
of
medical
providing
of
unnecessary
and
unreasonable
care.
should--
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
--your
honor,
that
may
very
well
be
true.
i
do
think
that
the
state
action
question
is
logically
prior,
and
so
i
assume
that
the
court
must
reach
that
question
first,
but
in
terms
of
full
relief...
excuse
me.
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
yes,
your
honor,
although
in
the...
in
the
san
francisco
athletic
case,
the
gay
olympics
case,
the
court
did
both
decide
a
state
action
question
and
the
first
amendment
question
which
was
logically
related
to...
to
the
two.
so,
the
court...
the
court
certainly
has
authority--
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
--lower
courts,
fortunately,
aren't
free
to
say
that,
justice
kennedy.
well,
if
i
can
now
turn
to
the
state
action
issue.
at
stake
in
this
doctrinal
question
is
whether
to
constitutionalize
major
aspects
of
the
administration
of
workers'
compensation
and
other
state
mandated
but
not
state
provided
insurance
and
employment...
and
employee
benefit
programs.
if
these
issues
involve
state
action,
then
quintessential
questions
of
regulatory
policy
that
are
now
decided
by
private
parties
subject
to
regulation
by
the
state
will
become
the
regular
business
of
the
federal
courts.
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
well,
your
honor,
in...
in
tulsa...
an
ordinary
private
citizen,
such
as
the
administrator
of
an...
of
an
estate
does
not
have
the
power
to...
to
end,
to
cut
off
the
rights
of
their
creditors.
that
is
not
something
that
private
citizens
can
do
on
their
own.
in
tulsa,
they
go
to
the
state
and
the
state
provides
the
active
assistance
that
enables
them
to
accomplish
this
result,
that
is,
cutting
off
their
creditors'
claims,
that
they
couldn't
do
on
their
own.
in
our
case,
by
contrast,
private
companies
regularly
withhold
the
payments
to...
pending
resolution
of...
of
disputes.
there's
no
need
for
government
assistance.
this
is
something
which
is
done
in
the
private
realm
on
a
regular
basis.
in
fact,
what
goes
on
in
our
case--
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
--well,
your
honor,
it
has
to
do
with...
what
the...
what
the
private
party
can
do
is
withhold
payment
pending
some
kind
of
legal
process
that
comes
down
the
road,
which
is,
of
course,
the
standard
practice
with
insurance.
if
you
have...
if
you're
involved
in
a
fender
bender
and
you
have
a
dispute
with
your
insurance
company,
the
insurance
company
will
decline
to
pay,
and
then...
and
you
will
have
some
sort
of
a
cause
of
action
against
the
insurance
company.
that
is
all
that's
going
on
in
this
case.
in
fact,
rather
than
state
assistance
in
this
case,
all
we
have
is...
is
a
limitation
on
what
would
otherwise
be
the
perfectly
private
right
of
a
private
company
to
withhold
payments
pending
resolution
of
a
private
dispute.
and
the
court
was
very
clear
in
jackson,
as
well
as
other
cases,
that
regulation
of
private
activity
does
not
make
that
activity
into...
into
state
action.
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
well,
your
honor,
workers'
compensation
is
a
substitute
for
private
tort,
but
that
seems
to
support
our
contention
that
this
is
private
action.
workers'
compensation
has
a
different
set
of
substantive
rules,
no-fault
liability,
instead
of
negligence
liability,
and
has
a
somewhat
different
set
of
procedurals,
a
streamlined
administrative
procedure
instead
of
having
to
go
to
court.
but
in
other
respects,
it
remains
the
liability
of
private
employers
to
their
workers
for
work-related
injuries.
the
obligation
is
not
an
obligation
of
the
state
of
pennsylvania.
the
obligation
is
a...
is
an
obligation
mandated
by
the
state,
but
a
private
obligation
imposed
upon
the
employer
and
then
insured
by
the...
by
the
insurance
company.
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
i
don't
think
that's
correct,
justice
ginsburg.
if
we're
wrong
on
our
theory
of
state
action,
then
the
due
process
issue
is
certainly
presented.
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
if
we're
right
on
our
theory
of
state
action,
we
still
have...
there
are
still
parties
before
this
court
who
are
bound
by
the
judgment
of
the
third
circuit
and
who
are
confessedly
state
actors.
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
and
this
court
certainly
has
the
authority
to...
to
reverse
the
third
circuit.
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
your
honor,
we
would
not.
however,
other
parties
that
are
still
present
within
this
court
under
this
court's
rules
remain
bound
by
the
due
process
holding
of
the--
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
--that's
exactly
right,
justice
souter.
the...
the
risks
of...
of
these
mispayments,
that
is
payment
for
medical
care
that
turns
out
not
to
be...
not
to
be
reasonable
and
necessary,
is
borne
by
the
system
as
a
whole,
private
insurers
as
well
as
public
insurers.
so,
we
have
a
direct
financial
interest
in
the
outcome
as
applied
to
the
government
parties
in
this
case
as
well.
but
as
this...
as
the
discussion
so
far
has
already
indicated,
that
this
case
is
a...
does
not
involve
a
traditional
public
function
in
any...
in
any
sense.
that
is
to
say,
neither
the
provision
of
workers'
compensation
nor
the
specific
decision
in
this
case
to
suspend
payments
in
what
amounts
to
a
commercial
dispute
is
traditionally
a
public
function,
let
alone
an
exclusive
public
function.
moreover,
the
decisions
made
here
are
not
mandated
by
the
state.
even
the
third
circuit
concedes
that
it
is
totally
up
to
the
insurance
companies
whether
to
invoke
utilization
review.
but
what's
more,
they
are
not
even
significantly
assisted
by
the
state.
they
are
regulated
by
the
state,
to
be
sure;
that
is
to
say,
that
the
state
is
involved
in...
in
requiring
certain
filings
and
in...
and
in
requiring
a
prompt
payment
and
in
setting
forth
a
particular
form
of
dispute
resolution
mechanism.
but
those
are
limitations
on
what
would
otherwise
be
the
private
authority
of--
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
--yes,
justice
o'connor.
the
assumption
here
is
that
a
course
of
medical
treatment
that's
appropriate
in
one
month
is
not
necessarily
reasonable
or
necessary
in
some
other
period.
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
every
bill--
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
--well,
every
bill
is
a
new
payment,
your
honor,
and
so
when
the
doctor
submits
the
bill,
the
insurance
company
decides
whether...
if
there's
no
question
about
its
appropriateness,
they
simply
pay
within
the
30-day
period.
if
they
believe
that
there's
some
question,
then
they
submit
it
for
utilization
review
and
withhold
payment
pending
that.
and
that
brings
us
to
the
due
process
issue,
because
i'd
like
to
be...
like
to
talk
about
what
is
the
impact
on
the
individual
worker
of
this
kind
of
a...
of
a...
of
an
arrangement.
note
that
the--
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
--well,
your
honor,
i
don't
think
that
people
automatically
assume
that
just
because
they've
been
receiving
a
course
of
treatment
that
it
necessarily
is
going
to
be
something
that
they
have
forever.
but
let
me
be
more
specific
about
that
because
i
think
it's
important
to
distinguish
between
the
effect
on
the
treatments
that
have
already
been
received
and
then
for
the
future.
for
those
that
have
already
been
received,
the
worker
is
essentially
not
affected.
the
question
is,
is
the
doctor
going
to
be
paid?
the
focus
of
this
litigation
has
been
on
the
indirect
effect,
the
fear
that
because
of
the
process
being
invoked,
that
their
medical
provider
might
choose
not
to
provide
further
treatments
in
the
future.
and
the
third
circuit
seemed
to
operate
on
the
assumption
that
a
suspension
in
payment
was
tantamount
to
terminating
the
medical
benefits,
but
i
think
any
reflection
upon
that
will
show
that
that
is
simply
not
the
case.
what
the
medical
provider
has
to
do,
the
medical
provider
becomes
on
notice
that
someone
is
going
to
be
examining
the
reasonableness
and
necessity
of
the
course
of
treatment.
and
that
medical
provider
will
continue
to
provide
the
treatment
if
he
believes
that
an
impartial
process
will
conclude
that
it's
reasonable
and
necessary.
it's
only
in
the
case
where
the
medical
provider
himself
realizes
that
the
bill
in
the
end
is
likely
not
to
be
payable
that...
that
the
medical...
that
the
course
of
treatment
will
be...
not
be
provided.
but,
your
honor--
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
--your
honor,
i
think
it's
a
matter
of
the
logical
implication
of
this...
of
this
statutory
scheme.
the
doctors
will
be
paid
if
the
conclusion
of...
of
full
process
is
that
the...
that
the
medical
procedures
are
reasonable
and
necessary,
and
they
will
be
compensated
for
the
delay
in
payment
by
10
percent
annual
interest.
the
only
reason
that
the
doctor
would...
or
the
provider
would
not
continue
treatment
is
if
he
had
some
doubt
about
the...
the
outcome
of
that
proceeding.
and
far
from
being
a
denial
of
due
process,
your
honor,
i
would
submit
that
is
exactly
what
we
want
health
care
providers
to
be
thinking
about,
that
is,
is
the
course
of
treatment
that...
that
i'm
proposing
reasonable
and
necessary.
and
by
putting--
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
--well,
your
honor,
if
that
amounts
to
a
due
process
violation
on
the
part
of
the
worker,
then
any
scheme--
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
--well,
your
honor,
any
scheme
that...
that
requires
the
doctor
to
justify
the
treatment
is
going
to
have
that
effect.
even
if
we
paid
in
advance,
subject
to
recoupment,
the
doctor
would
have
to
spend
time
litigating.
so,
that
is
not
a
product
of
this
particular
scheme.
the
only
thing
this
particular
scheme
does
is
that
it
forces
the
health
care
provider
to...
to
bear
the
risk
that
at
the
end
of
the
day
the...
the
care
that
he's
providing
may
not
be
within
the
statutory
limits.
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
exactly.
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
that's
exactly
right.
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
that's
exactly
right.
it's
so
reasonable
as
a
system
that
it
is--
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
--no,
there's
not,
your
honor.
that's...
it
is
assumed
that
once
the
person
is
disabled,
that
they
remain
eligible
for
the
disability
benefits
until
the
insurance
company
has
invoked
a
process
and...
and
until
after
that
process
has
been
complete.
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
the
payments
would
continue
in
the
interim.
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
no,
your
honor.
because
this
is
workers'
compensation,
the
liability,
both
for
the
employer
and
for
the
insurer,
is
strictly
limited
to...
within
the
workers'
compensation
scheme.
other
outside
forms
of
liability
are...
are
preempted.
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
that's
the
way
i
understand
the
law.
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
within
the
utilization
review
process
itself,
if
the...
it's...
it's
de
novo,
but
that
unless
the...
but
there's
an
effect
of
presumption
in
favor
of
the
care
because
if
the
utilization
reviewer
is
unable
to
determine
whether
or
not
it
is
reasonable
and
necessary,
he
must
find
that
it
is.
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
justice
kennedy,
i
believe
that
what
the...
the
employee
is
a
third
party
beneficiary
of...
of
a
contract
between
his
employer
and
the
insurer.
but
i
don't
believe
that
anything
hinges
upon
that
characterization.
i'd
like
to--
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
--the
actual
notice
to
the
employee
is
given
by
the
state
and
not
by
the
insurance
company.
so,
i
don't
know
that
the
notice
would
be
affected
by
that.
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
if
the
state
sends
the
notice
to
the
employee.
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time.
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
i
waive
my
time
for
rebuttal.
