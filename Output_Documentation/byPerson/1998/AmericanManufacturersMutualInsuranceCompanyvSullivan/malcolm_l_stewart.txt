mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
government
agrees
with
the
petitioners
both
that
the
withholding
of
payments
under
the
workers'
compensation
scheme
is
not
state
action
and
that
even
if
the
insurers
were
regarded
as
state
actors,
the
scheme
would
comport
with
due
process.
as
to
the
state
action
question,
in
our
view
the
insurance
company's
actions
under
the
pennsylvania
workers'
compensation
statute
are
no
different
in
principle
from
an
insurance
company's
actions
in
any
other
context.
that
is,
the
company
gets
the
claim
in
order
to
determine
whether
it
believes
itself
to
be
liable
for
payment.
it
must
undertake
an
internal
process
of
studying
the
facts,
studying
the
laws,
deciding
what
its
rights
and
obligations
are.
if
the
company
determines
that
it's
not
liable
for
payment,
the...
it
withholds
payment,
the
consequence
may
well
be
the
triggering
of
a
state
adjudicatory
mechanism.
and
the
conduct
of
that
adjudicatory
mechanism
may
well
involve
considerable
state
action,
but
the
insurer
itself
is
not
a
state
actor.
and
the
only
difference
between
the
pennsylvania
workers'
compensation
scheme
and
other
insurance
contexts
is
that
a
slightly
different
legal
standard
applies:
fault
if
the
employer's
fault
is
not
at
issue
and,
second,
the
onus
is
on
the
insurer
to
invoke
the
utilization
review
process,
whereas
in
the
normal
context,
as...
as
mr.
mcconnell
pointed
out,
if
the
insurance
company
denies
a
claim,
it
would
be
up
to
the...
the
claimant
to
file
suit
or
undertake
other
remedies.
and
i
think
more
generally
we
could
analogize
the
insurance
company
to
the
defendant
in
any
private
civil
action.
that
is,
whenever
somebody
is
sued
for
money,
the
defendant
will
first
be
required
to
make
an
internal
determination
as
to
whether
it
considers
itself
to
be
liable.
it
will
have
to
decide
whether
to
concede
liability,
enter
into
settlement
negotiations,
or
undertake
to
defend
against
the
suit
on
the
merits.
but
the...
the
defendant's,
the
private
defendant's,
decision
to
insist
upon
judicial
resolution
of
the
dispute
doesn't
amount
to
state
action.
again,
the
conduct
of...
the
resolution
of
the
lawsuit
by
courts
and
juries
will
involve
state
action,
but
the
private
party
who
participates
in...
in
the
dispute
is
not
a
state
actor.
and
in
our
view,
the
mistake
that
the
third
circuit
made
was
in
focusing
on
the
quantity
of
the
contacts
between
the
insurance
company
and
state
officials
during
the
uro
process.
that
is,
the
third
circuit
pointed
out
that
the...
the
insurance
company
is
required
to
file
a
form
with
the
bureau.
it
will
be
required
to...
to
file
other
documents
in
connection
with
the
uro
process
itself.
again,
the
same
thing
is
true
of
any
other
civil
action
between
private
parties.
there's
extensive
connection,
interaction
between
the
parties
and
the
court
in
the
sense
that
they
file
briefs
and
pleadings,
but
the
private
parties
are
not
thereby
engaged
in
state
action.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
we
believe
that
it
is.
certainly
the
workers'
compensation
judge
who
made
the...
the
final
determination
would
be
a
state
actor
and
we
believe
that
the
ur...
that
the
utilization
review
organization
would
also
be
a
state
actor
because
it
is--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--my
understanding
is
that
they
are
organizations
which
will...
they
will
be
selected
at...
at
random.
they
will
assign
the...
the
case
to
doctors
in
the
same
or
a
similar
specialty.
they
are...
they
are
private
people.
they
are
not
full-time
state
employees.
but
in
our
view
they
would
be
exercising
delegated
authority
from
the
state,
performing
a
classic
adjudicatory
function
of
resolving
a
dispute
between
private
parties.
so,
we
think
that
the
ur
itself
would
be
a
state
actor,
but
neither
the
insurance
company
nor
the
provider
would
become
a
state
actor
simply
by
contesting
the...
the
question
before
the
ur.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
well,
certainly
if...
if...
to
take
the
easiest
example,
if
the
doctors
on
the...
if
the
utilization
review
organization
was
composed
of
people
who
had
a
financial
interest
in
the
outcome
of
the
dispute,
you
would
have
a
classic
due
process
violation
because
the
ur
itself
would
be
subject
to
procedural
due
process
rules.
its
resolution
of
the
dispute
might
or
might
not
affect
a
party's
constitutional
rights.
i
think
what's...
what's
crucial
in
this
case
with
respect
to
the
due
process
issue
is
that,
at
least
as
the
case
comes
to
this
court,
there
is
no
dispute
as
to
the
adequacy
of
the
procedures
by
which
the
ur
and
the
workers'
compensation
judge
will
make
the
ultimate
determination
as
to
whether
expenses
are
reasonable
and
necessary.
that
is,
the
plaintiffs
do
not
contend
that
the
state
procedures,
at
least
as
modified
by
the
new
notice
that
the
state
is
giving,
fail
to
provide
an
adequate
mechanism
for
making
that
determination
in
the
end.
their
only
complaint
is
with
the
withholding
of
payment
by
the
insurer,
pending
the
ur's
determination
of
the
dispute.
and
in
our
view,
as...
as
mr.
mcconnell
said,
that's
a
practice
that
is
consistent
with
the
way
that
ordinary
dispute
resolution
typically
works.
that
is,
when
a
person
has
a
claim
against
him
for
money,
the
usual
rule
is
that
the
person
can
withhold
payment
pending
resolution
of
the
dispute.
and
in
a
sense,
the...
the
workers'
compensation
scheme
here
is
more
favorable
to
the
employee
and
the
doctor
than
the
typical
rule
would
be
because
if
the...
if
the
doctor
prevails
before
the
ur,
if
the
ur
makes
the
determination
that
the
care
is
reasonable
or
necessary,
the
insurance
company
is
required
to
pay
at
that
time,
even
if
the
insurance
company
intends
to
seek
further
review
before
the
workers'
compensation
judge.
so,
the
state
doesn't
even
allow
the
insurer
to
wait
until
the
final
resolution
of
the
dispute.
the
state
has
simply
said
the
insurance
company
doesn't
have
to
make
payment
until
some
neutral
arbiter
has
agreed
with
the
health
care
provider
that
particular
services
are
reasonable
or
necessary.
the
only
type
of
exception
to
the
general
rule
that
this
court
has
recognized
in...
is
in
cases
such
as
goldberg
v.
kelly
where
a
claimant
has
initially
established
all
the
prerequisites
to
entitlement
to
a
stream
of
benefits
and
where
state
officials
attempt
to
cut
off
those
benefits
on
the
ground
that
circumstances
have
changed
such
that
the
individual
has
become
disentitled,
and
in
that
context,
the
court
has
said
that
procedural
due
process
protections
apply,
that
there
is
a
deprivation
of
property.
but
here,
the
initial
determination
that
the
worker
is
eligible
for
workers'
compensation,
that
he
was
injured
on
the
job
and
has
become
disabled
does
not
itself
imply
any
determination
as
to
the
reasonableness
or
necessity
of
any
particular
course
of
treatment.
so,
when
the...
the
ur...
when
the
insurer
invokes
the
ur
to
determine
that
question,
it's
not
asking
to...
for
a
ruling
that
circumstances
have
changed,
that
something
which
was
originally
established
is
no
longer
true.
it's
simply
asking
for
an
initial
determination
that
a
particular
course
of
treatment
is
reasonable
or
necessary,
and
in
our
view
that's
fully
consistent
both
with
the...
the
typical
dispute
resolution
process
and
with
constitutional
due
process
principles.
if
there
are
no
further
questions.
