ms.
loralyn
mckinley
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
before
i
address
the
legal
issues
that
are
before
the
court,
i'd
like
to
clarify
a
few
things
about
the
workers'
compensation
system
in
pennsylvania
and
how
the
utilization
review
processes
actually
work.
workers'
compensation
in
pennsylvania
is
a
no-fault
system
which
was
substituted
for
the
claimant's
right
to
sue
their
employer
for...
in
tort
for
work-related
injuries.
it
is
an
exclusive
system.
not
only
is
the
worker
precluded
from
suing
the
employer
for
negligence
or
any
other
common
law
action
that
he
might
have
had
prior
to
the
passage
of
the
act,
but
the
individual
is
trapped
into
the
system.
the
individual
is
not
permitted
to
go
outside
of
the
system
to
secure
medical
treatment.
so,
while
utilization
is
going
on,
regardless
how
long
that
might
take...
and
as
the
experience
of
the
named
plaintiffs
indicates,
it
can
take
years
to
be
resolved.
during
that--
ms.
loralyn
mckinley
--well,
the
process
itself
is
integrated.
the
utilization
review
process
is
part
of
the
state
system
for
the
determination
of
disputes
over
reasonableness
and
necessity
of
medical
care.
the
utilization
review
process
is
the
first
step,
but
if
the
utilization
review
organization
makes
an
adverse
decision
to
the
claimant,
which
is
made
without
notice
to
the
claimant
and
without
an
opportunity
for
the
claimant
to
be
heard--
ms.
loralyn
mckinley
--i
think,
justice
ginsburg,
that
you
raised
two
separate
issues.
the
first
issue,
as
to
the
commonwealth
defendants,
obviously
there
is
a
final
order
by
the
third
circuit,
the
petition
this
court
was
denied.
the
commonwealth
has
changed
its
procedures,
but
there's
still
an
issue
as
to
whether
the
third
circuit
ought
to
be
reversed
based
on
its
due
process
findings
in
which
there
was
no
notice
and
no
opportunity
to
be
heard.
that
is
what
the
petitioners
have
requested
in
this
case.
the
second
question
has
to
do
with
the
impact
of
the
request
for
utilization
review
and
the
suspension
of
payments
that
results.
once
the
utilization
review
organization
makes
its
decision,
it
then
goes
into
another
aspect
of
the
state
system,
and
during
that
entire
process,
from
the
minute
the
utilization
review
is
invoked
until
the
appeals
are
completed,
the
person
is
not
able
to
receive
medical
treatment
unless
they
can
find
a
doctor
that
can
treat
them
for
free.
ms.
loralyn
mckinley
all
right.
we
agree
that
under
the
present
as
the
state
has
revamped
the...
the
procedures
after
the
third
circuit's
decision,
once
the
utilization
review
organization
makes
that
determination,
there
has
been
due
process
and
there's
nothing
that
the
claimant
can
do
about
it.
ms.
loralyn
mckinley
it
goes
on
for
months.
the
individual...
i'm
sorry.
go
ahead,
justice
breyer.
the
utilization
review
is
invoked
by
the
insurance
carrier.
there
are
no--
ms.
loralyn
mckinley
--there
are
no
limits
as
to
how--
ms.
loralyn
mckinley
--no.
we
don't
think
it
is
accurate.
ms.
loralyn
mckinley
it's
clearly
not
30
days.
as
you
can
see
from
the
experience
of
the
named
plaintiffs
in
the...
in
the
complaint,
there
are
no
limits
as
to
how
long
it
takes
the
state
to
refer
the...
or
the
request
to
the
utilization
review
organization.
ms.
loralyn
mckinley
i
have
no
idea,
your
honor,
because
this
case
was
dismissed
on
a
12(b)(6)
and
there
is
no
record.
after
the
decision
goes
to
the
utilization
review
organization,
they
have
60
days
because
they
have
30
days
to
acquire
the
records,
30
days
to
make
a
decision.
it
then
goes
back.
the
decision
is
circulated.
so,
it
often
takes
more
than
30
or
60
days
in
order
for
this
process
to
be
completed.
and
during
that
process,
which
takes
at
least
2
and
a
half
months
at
the
best...
at
best,
the
individual
is
precluded
from
receiving
medical
treatment
unless...
unless
the
doctor
is
willing
to
provide
the
treatment
for
free.
ms.
loralyn
mckinley
right.
ms.
loralyn
mckinley
yes,
but
this
is
not
a
private
tort
system.
this
is
clearly
a
public
benefit
system.
pennsylvania,
by
any--
ms.
loralyn
mckinley
--not
without
workers'
comp--
ms.
loralyn
mckinley
--but--
ms.
loralyn
mckinley
--but
in
that
system
you
don't
have
a
public
benefits
system,
which
we
clearly
do
in
this
situation.
ms.
loralyn
mckinley
that's
correct.
ms.
loralyn
mckinley
there
are
certainly
many
doctors--
ms.
loralyn
mckinley
--well,
i...
i
can't
say
about
yours
or
mine,
your
honor,
but
clearly
in
this
situation,
as
the
experience
of
most
of
the
named
plaintiffs
indicates,
doctors
don't
treat
unless
they're
going
to
get
paid
within
the...
within
the--
ms.
loralyn
mckinley
--yes.
ms.
loralyn
mckinley
they
were.
ms.
loralyn
mckinley
no,
it
wasn't
five.
i
believe
it
was
three.
three
of
the
named
plaintiffs
received
treatment.
others
did
not
receive
any
treatment
during
the
years
that
it
took
to
resolve
the
utilization
review...
the
utilization
review
request.
and
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
there's
a
typographical
error
in
our
brief
at
page
5
and
6
on
the
statute.
part
of
act
44,
which
imposed
the
preclusion
upon
a
claimant
from
even
going
outside
the
system,
but
if
the
claimant
wins
the
lottery,
the
claimant
still
can't
for
medical
treatment
while
this
medical
process
is
going
on.
it
should
say
531...
section
531(7)
instead
of
531(i).
ms.
loralyn
mckinley
that's
correct,
your
honor,
but
pennsylvania
substituted
that
system.
they
put
in
place
a
public
benefit
system
in
which
the--
ms.
loralyn
mckinley
--plaintiffs
have
a
property
interest.
ms.
loralyn
mckinley
we
think
that
it
changed
the
nature
of
the
property
right.
clearly
a
state
can't
have
a
public
benefit
system
in
which
it
does
not
ensure
due
process.
they
have
to--
ms.
loralyn
mckinley
--i
mean
a
system
that
is
guaranteed
by
state
law,
which
is
administered
by
state
law,
in
which
all
of
the
criteria,
all
of
the...
the
payments,
the
nature
of
the
payments,
the
amount
of
payments,
when
the
payments
can
be
made,
when
they
can
be
stopped,
the
administration,
everything
is
controlled
directly
by
the
state.
ms.
loralyn
mckinley
what
the
petitioners
are
basically
analogizing
this
to
is
car
insurance
and
other
kinds
of
private
commercial
insurance.
that's
not
what
this
is.
ms.
loralyn
mckinley
no,
because
it's
not
guaranteed.
this
system
guarantees
coverage--
ms.
loralyn
mckinley
--that's
correct.
ms.
loralyn
mckinley
what
the
state
has
done
is
to
substitute
that
system.
the
plaintiff
does
not
have
to
go
through
that
process
in
order
to
be
determined
eligible.
all
they
have
to
do
is
to...
to
sustain
a
work
injury.
and
each
of
the--
ms.
loralyn
mckinley
--that's
correct,
and
there
is
no--
ms.
loralyn
mckinley
--but
for
the
purposes
of
utilization
review,
all
of
that
is
assumed.
the
insurance
carrier
cannot
dispute
whether
the
person
is
eligible
for
workers'
comp.--
ms.
loralyn
mckinley
--because
the
state
has
the
duty,
in
the
context
of
this
system,
which
it
has
imposed
on
itself.
clearly
the
state
can't
just
delegate
to
the
insurance
company
the
right
to--
ms.
loralyn
mckinley
--the
state
guarantees
the
benefit,
number
one.
the
state
guarantees
that
the
benefits
will
be
paid,
that
there
is
a
source
for
the
payment
of
those
benefits
through
several
different
mechanisms,
and--
ms.
loralyn
mckinley
--yes,
i
am
saying
that.
pennsylvania
has
a
security
fund
that
does
just
that.
what
we're--
ms.
loralyn
mckinley
--i'm
not
exactly
sure
how
it
works,
but
i
know
that--
ms.
loralyn
mckinley
--i
don't
think
it
does,
your
honor.
i
don't
think
it
makes
any
difference
whether
the
state
says
to
the
insurers
we're
going
to
tax
you,
you
have
to
pay
us
a
certain
amount
of
money
every
year
in
order
to
insure
coverage
like
they
do
in
unemployment,
for
instance,
or
whether
they
say,
you
have
to
go
out
and
get
this
insurance
yourself,
and
if
you
can't
get
it
on
the
private
market,
we
will
provide
it
for
you
through
our
state
workers'
insurance
fund
to
make
sure
it's
there.
ms.
loralyn
mckinley
no,
that
is
not
what
we're
suggesting.
we've
never
suggested
that.
what
we
have
here--
ms.
loralyn
mckinley
--is
a
unique
context
in
which
the
benefits
are
guaranteed.
the
state
can
say
to
you--
ms.
loralyn
mckinley
--but
you
have
to
look
at
the
way
the
statute
works.
in
those
situations,
the
insurance
company
does
not
have
to
invoke
a
legal
process
like
it
does
in
this
context
because
we're
not
talking
about
a
commercial
setting.
the
insurance
company
and
the
state
are
intertwined
in
the
delivery
of
these
benefits
to...
to
injured
workers
and
in
the
way
those
benefits
are
terminated,
if
and
when
they
are--
ms.
loralyn
mckinley
--well,
certainly
if
the
individual
is
precluded
from
receiving
treatment
during
that
time--
ms.
loralyn
mckinley
--i
don't
think
it
necessarily
does.
but
in
the
context
of
this...
of
this
system,
we
have
a
system
that
vests
a
property
right
in
the
individual.
prior
to
the
act...
prior
to
act
44,
the
insurance
carriers--
ms.
loralyn
mckinley
--i
think
it
would
depend
on
how
it
works.
for
instance,
if
you
have
a
situation
like
the
named
plaintiffs
here,
where
they've
been
receiving
treatment
for
sometimes
years
for
very
serious
work
injuries--
ms.
loralyn
mckinley
--i'm
trying
to.
ms.
loralyn
mckinley
i
think
as
long
as
it's
quick,
very
quick,
and
as
long
as
the
individual
has
a
right
to
be
heard
and
the
treatment
is
not
stopped
during
a
lengthy
process,
probably
that
system
will
be
constitutional,
but
clearly
that's
not
what
we
have
here.
act
44--
ms.
loralyn
mckinley
--it
doesn't
necessarily
have
to
be
that...
that
way...
you're
correct...
as
far
as
a
due
process...
for
due
process
purposes.
but
in
this
particular
context,
what
we
have
is
a
situation
in
which
claimants
had
a
vested
entitlement
to
their
medical
treatment
prior
to
act
44.
that...
that
treatment
could
not
be
stopped
by
an
insurance
carrier.
the
insurance
carrier
in
this
case
is
relying
upon
the
authority
of
state
law
which
is
delegated
to
them
through
the
passage
of
this
act.
that's
why
the
direct
challenge
to
the
law
is
so
important
here.
it
is
state
power
that
is
being
exercised
in
a
way
that
was
never
permitted
to
be
exercised
before.
the
state
always
exclusively
controlled
the
circumstances
under
which
an
insurance
carrier
could
stop
paying
medical
treatment
and--
ms.
loralyn
mckinley
--what
i'm
saying
is
that
in
this
context
what
we
have
is
a
transfer
of
state
power
from
the
state
to
the
insurance
carrier.
ms.
loralyn
mckinley
i'm
attempting
to
do
that.
i'm
sorry.
could
you
repeat
your
question?
ms.
loralyn
mckinley
right.
ms.
loralyn
mckinley
i'm
not
sure
it
would
be
different.
what...
i
think
what
you're
getting
at
is--
ms.
loralyn
mckinley
--not
necessarily.
not
necessarily.
it
depends
upon
the
nature
of
the
property
interest
that
the
state
has
conferred
to
begin
with.
and
in
this
situation,
what
we
had
was
a
state
conferring
a
property
interest
that
could
not
be
divested
without
the
state
itself
making
a
determination
that
the
treatment
was
not
reasonable
and
necessary.
ms.
loralyn
mckinley
no.
that's
not
our
argument.
we've
never
suggested
that
the
state
can't
change
the
context
under
which
an
individual
receives
public
benefits.
ms.
loralyn
mckinley
because
the
nature
of
the
property
interest
hasn't
changed.
there's
no
dispute
that
these
individuals--
ms.
loralyn
mckinley
--it
was
and--
ms.
loralyn
mckinley
--well,
there's
no
due
process
right
to
necessarily
have
the
law
always
be
the
same,
but
in
this
context,
you
have
a
state
system
providing
public
benefits
to
individuals.
the
state
has
to
ensure
due
process
in
that
system.
we
have
never
suggested
that
the
state
does
not
have
the
right
to
come
in
and
say
we
need
to
contain
costs
in
the
system.
we've
never
said
that
that--
ms.
loralyn
mckinley
--no.
the
state
always
has
the
due
process
obligation.
that's
the
whole
point.
the
state--
ms.
loralyn
mckinley
--we
don't
have
to...
we
don't
have
to
even
look
at
the
prior
statute
before
act
44
to
answer
the
question.
in
the
context
of
a
benefit
delivery
system,
the
state
always
has
to
proceed...
if
they're
going
to
use
a
state
established
procedure,
which
they
clearly
have
here,
due
process
has
to
be
included
in
that
process.
this
court
has
said
that
over
and
over
again.
you
can't
have
a
state
established
procedure--
ms.
loralyn
mckinley
--because
you're
taking
away
a
vested
property
right,
and
that's
what
the
problem
is,
through
a
state
established
procedure.
this
court
has
said
over
and
over
again
that
when
you
have
a
state
established
procedure
and
a
private
individual--
ms.
loralyn
mckinley
--i
think
that's
correct.
that's
in
a
completely
different
system,
in
a
commercial
system
where
the
tort
laws
clearly
are
in
place.
but
that--
ms.
loralyn
mckinley
--that's
exactly
what
i'm
saying.
ms.
loralyn
mckinley
that's
correct.
we've
never
said
that
they
can't
have
a
utilization
review
system.
that's
perfectly
fine
as
long
as
the
individual
has
an
opportunity
to
be
heard
and
notice
of
the...
of
the
process
until...
until
that
happens.
if
the
evidence
shows
that
treatment
is
not
reasonable
and
necessary,
we've
never
suggested
that
they
have
a
right
to
continue
having
treatment
forever.
that
has
never
been
our
argument.
all
we've
said
is
that
the
individual
requires
notice
and
an
opportunity
to
participate
before
the
suspension
takes
place.
ms.
loralyn
mckinley
that's
correct.
ms.
loralyn
mckinley
that's...
that's
really
the...
that's
really
where
the
problem
comes
in.
ms.
loralyn
mckinley
because
you
don't
have...
you
don't
have--
ms.
loralyn
mckinley
--that's
correct.
i
think
that's
correct.
you
don't
have
an
interruption
in
something
that
the
person
has
and
believes
that
they
have.
and...
and
the
state
hasn't
vested
a
property
interest
in
that
individual.
ms.
loralyn
mckinley
well--
ms.
loralyn
mckinley
--the
real...
the
real
problem
comes
in
in
the
way
the
cost
containment
actually
works
and
what
they're
really
focusing
on
is
ongoing
treatment
and
the
experience
of
the
named
plaintiffs
shows
that.
we
have
people
that
have
serious
work
injuries,
people
who
are
going
to
need
treatment
for
the
rest
of
their
lives.
they're
receiving
therapy--
ms.
loralyn
mckinley
--well,
there
are--
ms.
loralyn
mckinley
--there
are--
ms.
loralyn
mckinley
--there
are
precertification
provisions
in
the
act
for
that
particular
thing.
precertification
provisions.
for
instance,
if
an
individual
wants
to
have
an
mri
and
the
insurance
company
isn't
sure,
they
can...
there
is
a
precertification
provision
in
the
statute
so
that
they
can
take
a
look
at
it
before
the
mri
even
happens.
so,
you
don't
have
to
worry
about
it.
what
really
happens
and
what
the
insurance
carriers
are
really
targeting
their
behavior
toward
in
this
case
is
the
ongoing
treatment,
the
treatment
in
which
people
have
a
vested
interest.
and
in
order
for
them
to
stop
it,
they
cannot
do
it
by
themselves.
this
is
not
a
self-executing
statute.
ms.
loralyn
mckinley
no,
i
don't
believe
there's
anything--
ms.
loralyn
mckinley
--except
that
it's
not--
ms.
loralyn
mckinley
--yes,
but
it
doesn't--
ms.
loralyn
mckinley
--really
work
that
way.
that's...
that's
what
i'm
trying
to
tell
you.
i
would
like
to
go
back
to
justice
kennedy's
point
about
tulsa
because
it's
our
position
that
for
state
action
purposes,
tulsa
controls
this
case.
this
is
a
case
in
which
the
statute
is
not
self-executing.
the
insurance
company
has
to
invoke
a
state
established
procedure
in
order
to
interrupt
the
property
interest
at
stake
here,
and
the
state
remains
substantially
involved
in
that
procedure.
the
petitioners
would
like
to
divorce
the
decision
to
initiate
the
process
from
the
process
itself,
and
we
submit
to
you
that
that
is
not
appropriate.
this
process
is
a
state
process
from
start
to
finish--
ms.
loralyn
mckinley
--yes,
but--
ms.
loralyn
mckinley
--yes,
but
this
court
has
said
time
and
time
against
that
interim
deprivations
of
property
are
subject
to
due
process
constraints
just
as
complete
deprivations
of
property.
it
goes
to
the
nature
of
what
process
is
due,
not
whether
process
is
due
at
all.
ms.
loralyn
mckinley
well,
first
of
all,
outside
of
the
system,
they
would
clearly
have
the
right
to
do
that.
ms.
loralyn
mckinley
but
in
this
system,
they
should
ask
for
utilization
review,
and
they
will--
ms.
loralyn
mckinley
--yes,
they
do.
but,
you
know,
the
whole
premise
here
is
that
what
we
have
here
is
a
huge
system
in
which
people
are
running
around
making
fraudulent
claims
and
doctors
are
running
around
giving
fraudulent
treatment.
that
is
ordinarily
not
the
case.
we're
not
here
suggesting
that
there
are
no
claims
out
there
like
that.
what
we
are
suggesting
is
that
you
can't
throw
the
baby
out
with
the
bath
water.
