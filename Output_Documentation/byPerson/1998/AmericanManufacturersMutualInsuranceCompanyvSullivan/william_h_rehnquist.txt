insurance
company
v.
delores
scott
sullivan.
mr.
mcconnell.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
have
the
opinion
of
the
court
to
announce
in
no.
97-2000,
american
manufacturers
mutual
insurance
company
versus
sullivan.
in
1993
pennsylvania
amended
its
workmen’s
compensation
laws
to
allow
employers
or
their
insurers
to
withhold
payment
for
disputed
medical
treatment
pending
an
independent
review
to
determine
whether
the
treatment
was
reasonable
and
necessary,
this
treatment
being
received
by
the
injured
worker.
the
respondents
in
this
case
are
injured
workers
who
brought
suit
under
42
u.s.c.
§1983
on
behalf
of
themselves
and
a
class
of
similarly
situated
plaintiffs
challenging
the
suspension
of
these
payments
during
the
review
process
and
they
named
it
the
defendants
pennsylvania
officials
and
some
private
insurance
companies.
they
claimed
that
in
withholding
medical
benefits
without
any
sort
of
notice
and
an
opportunity
to
be
heard
on
the
part
of
the
workers.
the
state
and
private
defendants
acting
"under
color
of
state
laws,"
to
the
private
defendants
deprived
them
of
property
in
violation
of
the
due
process
clause.
the
district
court
ruled
against
them
saying
that
private
insurers
are
not
state
actors.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
third
circuit
reversed
and
said
they
were
state
actors.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
of
the
court
today,
we
reverse
the
court
of
appeals
and
say
they
are
not
state
actors.
we
hold
that
a
private
insurer’s
decision
to
withhold
payment
and
seek
utilization
review
under
the
act
is
not
fairly
attributable
to
the
state
so
as
to
subject
insurers
to
the
constraints
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
under
our
state
action
cases
respondents
have
to
show
that
the
state
is
compelled
or
coerce
the
challenge
decisions
where
it
is
so
significantly
encouraged
that
decision
as
to
make
state
responsible
for
them.
respondents
simply
have
not
made
this
showing,
the
act
merely
permits,
it
does
not
require
an
insurer
to
withhold
payment
for
disputed
treatment,
nor
is
the
state
by
amended
the
act
in
one
distinct
way
to
favor
employers
so
insignificantly
encouraged
insurers
to
withhold
payment
that
the
decision
to
do
so
must
be
deemed
out
of
the
state.
in
holding
to
the
contrary,
the
court
of
appeals
relied
heavily
on
language
in
one
of
our
earlier
cases
dealing
with
state
action
burton
versus
wilmington
parking
authority.
but
later
cases
including
blum
against
yaretsky
and
jackson
versus
metropolitan
edison
had
considerably
refined
the
vague
joint
participation
as
to
embodied
in
burton.
here,
workers’
compensation
insurers
are
no
more
extensively
regulated
than
the
private
entities
in
blum
and
jackson.
like
those
cases
though
the
states
can
lead
the
challenge
decisions
of
the
judgment
of
the
insurers
and
therefore
there
is
no
state
action.
we
also
hold
that
the
pennsylvania
regime
does
not
deprive
respondents
of
property
within
the
meaning
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
this
is
significant
in
this
case
because
some
of
the
parties
were
obvious
state
actors,
state
officials.
under
state
law
respondents
are
not
entitled
to
payments
for
all
medical
treatment
if
their
argument
assumes
but
only
for
treatments
that
is
reasonable
and
necessary.
state
law
requires
an
employee
to
establish
the
reasonableness
and
the
necessity
of
the
particular
medical
treatment
at
issue
before
his
property
interests
in
medical
benefits
attach
it.
respondents
haven’t
yet
made
this
showing
and
therefore
they
don’t
have
a
property
interest
in
the
payment
of
benefits.
justice
ginsburg
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
part
and
concurring
in
the
judgment;
justice
breyer
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
part
and
concurring
in
the
judgment
in
which
justice
souter
has
joined;
and
justice
steven

filed
an
opinion
concurring

part
and
