unknown
speaker
have
they
petitioned,
mr....
mr.
mcconnell?
unknown
speaker
mr.
mcconnell,
from
what
you've
said,
it
seems
to
me
that
if
the
due
process
question
were
decided
in
your
favor...
as
you
mentioned,
you
have
the
state
insurance
fund
in
there
and
public
employers.
if
the
due
process
question
is
decided
in
your
favor,
isn't
the
state
action
question
academic?
unknown
speaker
that
was
the
way
we
decided
jackson
v.
metropolitan
edison.
we
have
the
state...
we
decided
the
state
action
question
first
because
we
thought
it
was
prior,
but
we
did
not
go
on
to
decide
the
due
process
question.
unknown
speaker
leaving...
leaving
later
generations
to
say
that
one-half
or
the
other
is
dictum.
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
what's
your
best
argument
to
distinguish
tulsa
professional
collection?
it
seems
to
me
to
be
one
of
the
cases
that's
closely
on
point.
unknown
speaker
so,
the
distinction
is
between
cutting
it
off
all
together
and
simply
deferring
payment?
unknown
speaker
well,
that
is
true
if
you
focus
just
on
the
specific
action
here,
to
wit,
failing
to
pay
benefits
while
you
determine
if
it's
reasonable
or
necessary.
but
if
you
look
at
the
compensation...
workers'
compensation
scheme
in
a
broader
fashion,
it
is
true,
is
it
not,
that
pennsylvania
deprives
people
of
their
private
state
tort
action
as
part
of
the
overall
workmen's
comp
scheme?
does
that
bring
this
any
closer
to
state
action?
unknown
speaker
but
you've
pointed
out
the
unseemliness
of
having
two
regimes.
the
state
fund,
which
certainly
is
a
state
actor...
to
bring
them
together,
if
you're
right
on
the
due
process...
well,
if
you're
wrong
on
the
due
process
point,
we
wouldn't
get
to
the
due
process
point
for
your...
on
your
theory
of
state
action.
we
wouldn't
because
it
might
be
advisory.
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
if
you're
right
on
your
theory
of
state
action.
unknown
speaker
well,
you
say--
unknown
speaker
--if
you're
right
on
your
theory
of
state
action,
you
say
you're
also
right
on
your
theory
of
due
process.
and
we've
certainly
given
more
than
one
reason
for
our
outcome
in...
in
other
cases.
well,
if
you're
right
on
your
theory
of
state
action,
you
wouldn't
get
involved
with
due
process
because
you
wouldn't
be
a
state
actor.
unknown
speaker
but
there
would
be...
wouldn't
there
be
a
financial
effect
on...
on
you
depending
on
the
due
process
outcome?
because
in...
as
i
understand
the
scheme,
you
all
contribute
to
the
fund
for,
whatever
you
call
it,
recoupments
by
companies
that
pay
and
then
later
are
determined
not...
not
to
have
been
liable,
so
that
the
amount
that
you
have
to
contribute
to
that
fund
will
vary,
i
suppose,
depending
on
how
the
due...
could
vary,
depending
on
how
the
due
process
point
comes
out.
unknown
speaker
mr.
mcconnell,
would
you
clarify
one
thing
for
me?
under
the
pennsylvania
system,
is
it
possible
that
the
insurer
might
pay
for
treatment,
let's
say,
chiropractic
treatments,
over
a
period
of
months
and
then
conclude
maybe
it
should
suspend
further
payment
and
raise
the
question
of
whether
it's
reasonable
and
necessary?
unknown
speaker
is
every
payment
a
new
issue,
if
you
will,
or
not?
unknown
speaker
or...
or
does
that
add
up
to
some
sort
of
expectation
on
the
part
of
the
patient?
unknown
speaker
yes,
because
if
the
worker
were
receiving
some
kind
of
a
series
of
medical
treatments
and
thought
at
least
that
it
was
helping
and
then,
all
of
a
sudden,
it
suspended,
is
there
some
kind
of
a...
an
expectation
that
we
have
to
weigh
in
the
balance?
unknown
speaker
do
you
say
this
as
a
matter
of
logic
or
experience?
there
are
other
states
that
have
a
similar
regime.
has
it,
in
fact,
turned
out
that
doctors
are
concerned
about
not
being
paid
by
anyone
and
so
indeed
suspend
treatment?
unknown
speaker
well,
the...
the
provider
may
simply
say,
i
think
it's
reasonable
and
necessary
and
i
think
i'll
win
at
the
end
of
the
day,
but
i'm
not
interested
in
spending
my
time
litigating.
this...
this
is
simply
a
patient
i
don't
want
to
bother
with.
it's
too
much
trouble.
unknown
speaker
well,
i'm
not
sure
it
amounts
to
a
violation.
i'm
simply
saying
that
it
is...
it
is...
it
is...
it
is
one
of
the
factors
that
i
think
have
got
to
be
considered
in
assessing
the
interests
involved.
unknown
speaker
am
i
right
about
the
scheme?
i'm...
i'm
just
trying
to
be
sure
i
understand
it.
is
it
the
case...
suppose
a
worker
is...
everybody
agrees
he's...
he
was
injured
at
work.
and
he...
his
doctor
submits
a
bill
that
is
absurd.
let's
imagine
trips
to
florida,
whatever
it
is,
totally
absurd.
the
law
is
that
the
medical
insurer
has
to
pay
that
bill
unless
he
files
a
piece
of
paper,
according
to
this
scheme,
and
if
he
files
that
piece
of
paper,
the
state
sends
it
to
a
doctor,
another
doctor,
who
looks
at
it
for
reasonableness,
and
then
there
are
further
proceedings
that
take
place.
in
other
words,
unless
he
submits
that
piece
of
paper,
he
has
to
pay.
unknown
speaker
if
he
submits
the
piece
of
paper,
he
doesn't
have
to
write
a
check.
he
doesn't
have
to
pay
a
penny--
unknown
speaker
--thank
you.
unknown
speaker
how
does
it
compare...
how
does
it
compare
with
the
determination
of
the
disability,
if
there's
a
disagreement
between
the
patient's
doctor...
let's
say
the
question
is,
is
this
person
totally
disabled
or
only
partially
disabled?
is
he
temporarily
disabled
or
permanently
disabled?
is
there
the
same
thing
when
there's
a
disagreement
for
immediate
suspension?
unknown
speaker
the
payments
would
continue
during
the
process.
unknown
speaker
if
the
insurer
unreasonably
filed
this
piece
of
paper
and
unreasonably
delays
payment
and
causes
some
injury
to
the
patient
in
that
fashion,
does
the
patient
have
a
cause
of
action?
unknown
speaker
against
the
insurer
as
well
as
the
employer.
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
if...
if
on
review
of
a...
of
a
decision
by
the
insurance
company
to
terminate
payments,
is
that...
is
that
de
novo,
or
does
one
side
or
the
other
have
the...
have
the
presumptively
correct?
unknown
speaker
how
would
you
describe
the
employee's
legal
interest
in
the
case?
a
claim
or
an
anticipatory
claim?
because
the
third
circuit
said
it
was
an
entitlement,
which
seems
to
me
somewhat
of
a
loose
use
of
that
term.
but
how
do
you
describe
what
the
employee
has?
unknown
speaker
may
i...
just
one
quick
question.
if
you
win
on
the
state
action
issue,
that
would
mean
you...
you
could
cease
giving
notice
to
the
employee.
that's
what
would
really
be
at
issue
here
i
suppose.
unknown
speaker
that's
the
revised
procedure
where
the
state
gives
the
notice.
unknown
speaker
thank
you,
mr.
mcconnell.
mr.
stewart,
we'll
hear
from
you.
unknown
speaker
is
the
ur
examiner
a
state
actor?
unknown
speaker
who
is
the...
who
is
the
uro?
is
it
a
private
doctor,
a
group
of
private
doctors?
unknown
speaker
so,
if
the
ur
cut
off
notice...
cut
off
plans
without
any
notice,
then
you'd
have
a
tulsa
collection
case.
unknown
speaker
thank
you,
mr.
stewart.
ms.
mckinley,
we'll
hear
from
you.
unknown
speaker
but
you
are
only
contesting
the
time
before
the
uro,
as
i
understand
it.
once
the
uro
makes
its
determination
and
it
goes
to
the
alj...
the
uro
procedure
itself
doesn't
take
years,
does
it?
that
takes
30
to
70
days.
unknown
speaker
well,
we...
we've
over
that
now
because
i
think
it's
taken
as
given
under
the
new
state
notice.
there
is
notice.
there
is
an
opportunity
to
submit
something
in
writing.
so,
i
thought
that
the
issue
was
only
suspending
payment
in
the
interim.
and
my
question
is,
how
long
is
the
interim
you
are
challenging?
i...
i
probably
misunderstood
you
then
because
i
had
assumed
that
you
were
talking
about
the
uro
determination,
and
if
that
determination
were
adverse,
you
were
not
saying
that
there
was
a
due
process
right
to
continue
to
get
paid
after
that.
i
thought
you
were
just
talking
about
the
uro
period.
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
if
one...
i
understand
your
argument
to
say
this
person's
own
doctor
thinks
they
should
be
paid,
and
until
the
utilization
review
person
makes
a
determination,
it
isn't
fair
to
take
these
benefits
away.
but
once
that
determination
is
made
by
an
independent,
private
examiner,
then
it
seems
to
me
it's
a
separate
question,
that
it
isn't
all
one.
something
significant
has
changed
once
the
uro
says
that's
an
unreasonable
charge.
unknown
speaker
right.
so,
we're
not
talking
about
years.
we're
talking
about...
the
only
due
process
claim
you
can
and
are
making
is
the
one
that
concerns
the
uro
process,
and
that
doesn't
go
on
for
years.
unknown
speaker
the
briefs
say
30
to
70
days.
unknown
speaker
is
that...
is
that
30...
is
that
accurate--
unknown
speaker
--that
the
statute
says
30
days,
but
it
can
go--
unknown
speaker
--where
did
the
30
to
70...
the
average
is
something
like
70
days--
unknown
speaker
--wait.
i
don't
understand.
where
did
that...
why
is
that
different
from
what...
from
what
would
have
obtain
under
the
system
which
you
say
workers'
compensation
replaced?
you
began
by
saying
that
you've
been
forced
into
this
system
from
a
private
tort
system.
unknown
speaker
now,
in
a
private
tort
system,
couldn't
the
same
thing
happen?
couldn't
the
insurer
just
simply
say
i
don't
think
this
is
a
proper
claim
and
i'm
not
going
to
pay
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
but...
but
you...
you
don't
claim
you're
any
worse
off
than...
than
what
you
would
have
been
like
without
workmen's
comp.--
unknown
speaker
--i
mean,
in
fact,
you
might
have
to
wait
years
until
completion
of...
of
all
the
appellate
proceedings
in...
in
a
private
tort
suit--
unknown
speaker
--against
the
insurer.
unknown
speaker
what
about
any
medical?
i
mean,
all
of
us
have
medical
insurance.
i
thought
you
said
twice
we're
talking
about
a
person
who
doesn't...
you
were
talking
about
a
patient
who
won't
get
treated.
unknown
speaker
i
thought
that
this
was
about
reimbursing
the
doctor.
i
mean,
all
of
our
doctors
might
not
get
reimbursed
if
the
insurer
decides
the
treatment
they're
getting
is
unreasonable,
but
that
hasn't
stopped
my
doctor
from
treating
me.
and
i...
and
i...
and
i
don't...
i
don't
know...
maybe
i've
mixed
this
up.
that's
why
i'm
asking
you.
but
i...
i
thought
we
were
talking
about
the
doctor
running
the
risk
that
the
insurer
won't
reimburse
him
if
the
insurer
considers
the
bill
unreasonable.
and...
and
are
there
a
lot
of
doctors
who...
whom
that
fact
discourages
from
giving
treatment?
there
might
be.
unknown
speaker
it
doesn't
discourage
yours
or
mine,
does
it?
unknown
speaker
you
know,
but
they'll
get
paid
for
what
the
insurer
considers
reasonable.
so,
are
the
plaintiffs
in
this
case...
were...
were
the
plaintiffs...
i'm
interested.
i'm
not
asking
rhetorically.
were
they...
were
they...
did
they...
were
they
denied
treatment?
unknown
speaker
why?
unknown
speaker
i
thought
5
out
of
the
10
continued
to
receive
treatment?
unknown
speaker
well,
to
say...
to
say
you
can't
go
outside
the
system,
i
mean,
that's
really
true
long
before
workmen's
compensation
came
in.
you
can,
if
you're
injured
without
a
workmen's
compensation,
depend
on
private
tort
law.
you
know,
you
can
pay
your
own
expenses
if
you
want
to,
but
in
order
to
get
reimbursed
for
your
medical
expenses,
you
have
to
follow
the
procedure
of
suing
in
court
or
compromising
with
the
insurer.
unknown
speaker
why
do
you--
unknown
speaker
--just
a
minute.
slow
down,
will
you?
what
do
you
gain
for
your
case
by
calling
it
a,
quote,
public
benefit,
closed
quote,
system?
unknown
speaker
what
do
you
mean
by
public
benefit
system?
what's
a
public
benefit
system?
unknown
speaker
why
isn't
that
essentially
true
of
a
tort
system?
i
mean,
the
state
determines
the
content
of
tort
law,
the
obligation
to
pay,
the
procedure
by
which
the...
the
payment
obligation
may
be
contested.
it's...
i
mean,
in
each
case
the
system,
it
seems
to
me,
is
equally
a
public
benefit
system
on...
on
your...
on
your
theory.
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
what
about
the
answer...
what
about
the
answer
to
my
question?
it
seems
to
me
that
every
feature
that
you've
just
described
under
the
comp
system,
as...
as
being
a
reason
for
calling
it
a
public
benefit
system,
is
a
feature
that
you
could
equally
describe
in
the
same
terms
under
the
traditional
tort
system.
unknown
speaker
well,
it...
it
guarantees,
if
one
determines
eligibility,
for
the
coverage.
unknown
speaker
and
the
tort
system
guarantees
payment
if
one
fulfills
the
conditions
before
a
finder
of
fact
or
a
jury
for...
for
liability
and
damages.
and
in
each
case,
the
state
sets
the
criteria
for
payment.
one
is
a
no-fault
system,
the
other
is
not.
but
each,
in
effect,
is
equally
imposed
by
the...
by
the
state
i
would
suppose.
unknown
speaker
well,
now,
just
a
minute.
you
have
to
show
that
under
traditional
workmen's
comp
that
the
injury
arose
out
of
and
in
the
course
of
your
employment,
don't
you?
unknown
speaker
so,
there's
a
criteria
just
as
there
is
in
tort
law
where
you
have
to
show
negligence.
it's
not
as
if
you
could
simply
be
injured
and
automatically
get
coverage.
unknown
speaker
but...
but
your
argument
is
that
this
is
a
public
benefit
system,
and
i...
i
think
the
question
suggests
that
we're
curious
as
to
know
why
that
makes
it
different
analytically
from
the
traditional
tort
system.
unknown
speaker
well,
what...
what
duty
has
the
state
imposed
on
itself?
unknown
speaker
are
you...
are
you
saying
that
if...
if
the
workmen's
compensation
insurer
should
default,
then
the
state
comes
in
and
itself
makes
the
payment?
unknown
speaker
is
the
security
fund
appropriated
public
money
or
is
the
security
fund
a
fund
established
by
contributions
of
insurers?
unknown
speaker
well,
it
would
make
a
difference,
though,
i
would
think
to
your
argument,
wouldn't
it?
yes.
unknown
speaker
basically
what
i
think
is
worrying
at
least
me
is
if
you
were
to
win
this
case
on
the
state
action
point,
what
about
blue
cross-blue
shield?
what
about
accident
insurance
in
massachusetts
where,
after
all,
there
is
a
state
fund
to
pay
for
uninsured?
what
about
erisa
where
there
is
a
government
fund
to
pay
for
those
people
when
the
companies
go
bankrupt
leaving
a
pension?
there
are
dozens
of
very
complex
regulatory
schemes
that
involve
insurance
companies,
some
but
not
all
of
which
have
state
backup
funds.
they're
all
complicated.
they
all
regulate
private
employers
up,
down,
and
sideways.
all
right?
now,
we
just
see
one
more
here,
and
so,
what's
the
difference
between
yours...
or
do
you
think
that
all
private
employer
action
or
insurer
action
involving
health
care,
involving
pensions,
et
cetera,
insurance
of
any
sort
that's
regulated
is
government
action?
unknown
speaker
then
what's
the
difference?
unknown
speaker
they're
guaranteed
in
erisa.
they
are
guaranteed
in
massachusetts
in
respect
to
uninsured
motorists.
there
are...
it's
common
to
have
state
money
backing
up
insurance
that's
given
by
private
people.
unknown
speaker
but
does
due
process
require
the
particular
scheme
pennsylvania
has?
i
mean,
suppose
pennsylvania
had
said,
we're
going
to
have
a
workers'
compensation
scheme,
but
we're
going
to
have
a
check
on
the
reasonableness
of
the
bill
before
it's
paid,
and
that's
the
statute.
and
so,
they
set
up
this
checking
office
and
you
never...
the
worker,
the
doctor...
doesn't
get
paid
until
the
state
official
says
that's
okay.
would
that
be
a
violation
of
due
process?
unknown
speaker
not
precluded
from
receiving
treatment,
certainly
not.
and
the
state's
position
is
our
system
is
meant
to
work
fairly.
if
a
doctor's
charge
is
fair
and
reasonable,
we'll
pay
it
promptly.
and
they
have
time
limits
on
how
long
this
review
can
take
place,
but
nobody
gets
paid
up
front
without
any
check.
would
that
be
unconstitutional?
does
due
process
require
that
the
provider's
word
be
accepted?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
wish
you
address
my
question.
let...
let's
take
my
hypothetical
scheme
that
the
doctor's
bill
goes
to
a
checker
and
it
is
not
paid
until
the
checker
says
okay.
is
it
unconstitutional
to
run
a
workers'
compensation
system
that
way?
unknown
speaker
no.
i
wish
you
would
focus
on
mine--
unknown
speaker
--nothing
is
going
to
happen
for
years
because
there's
going
to
be
a
check
on
each
bill.
and
so,
there
won't
be
a
payment
unless
a
stop
signal
is
given
within
30
days.
but
there
will
be...
in
other
words,
you
will
have
to
get
a
green
light
instead
of
this
system
that
pennsylvania
now
has
where
a
red
light
can
be
turned
on.
unknown
speaker
i
don't
know
what
you
mean
by
the
treatment
not
stopping
because
i've
given
you...
my
question
is,
must
there
be
payment
first
during
litigation
or
can
there
be
like
it
would
be
in
the
tort
system?
you
get
paid
eventually
if
you're
right,
but
there's
no
immediate
right
to
be
paid.
unknown
speaker
excuse
me.
are
you
saying
that
your
answer
to
justice
ginsburg's
question,
which
was
that
it
would
have
been
okay,
would
change
if
the
state
had
initially
had
a
system
in
which
it
paid
the
medical
bills...
in
which
the
insurer
had
to
pay
the
medical
bills
immediately
and
then
changed
to
a
system
in
which
for
everybody,
nobody
gets
any
payment
until
the
medical
bills
are
substantiated?
in
the
latter
situation
you
say
it
would
be
unconstitutional
because
the
earlier
statute
had
conferred
a
vested
right
to
get
the
payment
immediately.
unknown
speaker
no.
i
want
you
to
answer
my
question.
you've
been...
you've
been
asked
several
questions,
ms.
mckinley,
and
the
people
who
have
asked
them
have
felt
you
haven't
answered
them.
try
to
answer
to
questions
directly.
unknown
speaker
the
question
is...
you
recall
justice
ginsburg's
question,
a
state
system
in
which
you
don't
get
any
payments
until
you
establish
that...
that
it
was
reasonable
medical
care.
as
i
understand
your
position,
you
say
that's
okay
because
there
was
no
vested
right
anyway
from
the
beginning.
unknown
speaker
would
your
answer
to
that
question
be
different
if
justice
ginsburg's
system
were
imposed
by
the
state
after
the
state
had
initially
had
a
system
in
which
you
could
get
your
medical
payments
immediately?
and
then
the
state
found
out
too
many
of
them
were
unreasonable,
so
it
said,
we're
changing
the
system.
from
now
on
you
don't
get
any
payments
until
after
you've
established...
you've
established...
that
it's
reasonable
and
necessary.
and
in
that
situation,
would
your
answer
to
justice
ginsburg
be
different?
unknown
speaker
well,
what
i'm
getting
at
is
it
seems
to
me
you
say
that
once
a
state
passes
a
statute
enacting
a
certain
welfare
scheme,
everyone
has
a
vested
interest
in
that
welfare
scheme,
and
any
change
from
it...
i
mean,
it's
your
characterization
that
it's
a
welfare
scheme.
i'm
not
sure
i
agree
with
it,
but
assuming
it
is,
any
change
from
that
original
welfare
scheme
is
the
elimination
of
a
vested
right
and
is
therefore
invalid.
unknown
speaker
no,
but
the...
i
think
you're
saying,
though,
that
the
state
cannot
change
its
law.
maybe
we
misunderstood
your
argument.
i
understood
your
argument
to
be
something
like
this,
that
in
the
original
state...
the...
the
version
of
the
workmen's
comp
scheme
that
preceded
this
one,
there
was
an
obligation
of
immediate
payment.
there
was...
there
was
no
option,
in
effect,
to...
to
file
the
protest
as
there
is
now.
and
i
understood
you
to
say
that
that
was
the
reason
why
the
state
could
not
go
to
the
scheme
that
it
has
gone
to
without
providing
this...
this
prior
notice
and
hearing.
and
it
sounds
to
me
as
though
what
you're
arguing
is
that,
in
effect,
the
state
cannot
change
its
law,
that
there
is
a
due
process
reason
that
forbids
the
state
to
make
it
harder
to
get
the
benefit,
that
due
process
is
a
one-way
ratchet.
if...
if
that's
not
your
argument,
then
i
think
probably
all
of
our
questions
could
be
forgotten.
unknown
speaker
then
what
is
the
relevance
of
the
fact
that
in
the
scheme
prior
to
the
modification
that
is
in
question
here,
there
was
an
obligation
to
pay
without
an
option
to
withhold
payment
under
protest?
what
is
the
relevance
of
that
for
your
argument?
unknown
speaker
but
the
nature
of
the
property
interest
was
derived
from
the
state
law,
wasn't
it?
unknown
speaker
and
now
the
state
law
has
changed
and
you
have
agreed
with
me
that
the
state
can
change
its
law.
there's
no
due
process
right
to...
to
have
the
law
continue.
and
that's...
so,
that's
why
i...
i
don't
follow
your
argument.
unknown
speaker
it
sounds
like
you're
saying
that
if
the
state
is
more
generous,
then
it's
going
to
be
saddled
with
the
due
process
obligations
that
it
wouldn't
have
if
it
had
been
less
generous
to
the
worker.
unknown
speaker
but
you
have
just
said
if
the
state
doesn't
pay
up
front,
if
it
says
we
want
proof
before
we
pay
any
bill,
then
you
wouldn't
have
your
claim
about
no
suspension.
due
process
wouldn't
require
it.
but
if
the
state
says,
we're
going
to
pay
but
if
it
turns
out
that
we
think
it's
getting
unreasonable,
we'll
stop.
that...
that's
what's
the
hardest
thing
for
me
to
accept
about
your
due
process
argument.
you
seem
to
say
the
state
could
do
anything
it
wants.
it
doesn't
have
to
pay
any
bill
without
a
check.
you
told
me
that.
but
once
it
is
more
generous
in
paying
immediately,
then
it
has
these
extra
requirements.
unknown
speaker
my
question
is
what
process
is
due,
and
you
told
me
that
in
a
case
of...
that
the
state
could
say,
we'll
check
every
bill,
and
that
wouldn't
violate
due
process.
so,
why
is
it
different
when
they
say
we'll
start
by
paying,
but
if
we
think
it's
unreasonable,
we'll
stop?
unknown
speaker
so,
if
you
were
to
prevail,
an
appropriate
answer
for
the
state
would
be
to
say,
we're
going
to
move
this
checking
system
up
and
we're
not
going
to
pay
any
bill
without...
without
determining
as
insurers...
isn't
that
the
way
insurers
ordinarily
work?
they
don't
pay
you
just
on...
you
call
up
and
say
something
happened
to
me.
i
want
to
be
paid.
unknown
speaker
let
me
get
into
these
hypotheticals
for
a
second.
do
i
correctly
understand
that
it's
your...
your
theory
that
once
the
state
has
started
to
make
payments,
they
have,
in
effect,
given
the
injured
worker
a
property
right
that
cannot
be
terminated
without
following
certain
due
process
procedures.
that's
the
essence
of
your
argument,
as
i
understand.
unknown
speaker
but
can
one
not
respond
by
saying
the
right
is
not
an
unlimited
right
to
continued
payment
forever.
the
right
is
merely
a
right
to
continue
payment
until
the...
until
a
serious
question
is
raised,
that
it's
inherent...
it's
a
limitation
on
the
right
rather
than
a
termination
of
the
right
that
the
request
for
review
triggers.
unknown
speaker
well,
is
that
then...
is
it
different
in
your...
i
take
it
the
same
statute,
the
same
scheme
applies
whether
the
insurer
protests
the
first
bill
or
whether
he
protests
the
18th
bill.
unknown
speaker
but
you're
only
talking
about
the
second
and
subsequent
bills.
unknown
speaker
you're
not
talking
about
that
first
bill.
it's
as
if
the
insurer
pays
the
first...
if
he
doesn't
pay
the
first
bill,
you
say
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
your
case.
unknown
speaker
is
that
right?
am
i
right?
unknown
speaker
all
right.
then...
then
i
guess
from
the
state's
point
of
view,
it
becomes
difficult
for
them
to
decide
what
this
due
process
right
does
or
does
not
apply
to
because
there
will
be...
you
know,
there
will
be
a
series
of
medical
bills
and
they
won't
all
be
for
the
same
thing,
and
the...
the
insurance
company
will
protest
some
and
they
won't
protest
others.
and
which
one
does
this
apply
to
and
what's
a
continuation
of
a
payment?
oh,
i
mean--
unknown
speaker
--how
in
your
mind
is
all
that
stuff
sort
itself
out?
unknown
speaker
all
right,
but
you
see...
i
understand
that.
my
question
was
just
how
in
your
view
is
it
supposed
to
work
in
terms
of
sorting
out
the
people
for
whom
this
is
a
continuation
of
treatment
and
those
for
whom
it's
a
new
treatment
and
those
for
which
it's
a
new
treatment
in
some...
do
you
see
the
problem?
unknown
speaker
i'm
just
asking
you
how
you've
sorted
that
out--
unknown
speaker
--in
your
mind.
unknown
speaker
is
there
anything
in
the
third
circuit's
opinion
that
says
what
it's
talking
about
is
limited
simply
to
those
situations
in
which
there
has
been
an
ongoing
set
of
treatments
of
the
same
sort
that
now
the
company
wants
to
terminate?
unknown
speaker
so,
as
far
as
we're
concerned,
we're
dealing
with
an
opinion
that
applies
as
much
to
the
first
treatment
as
to
the
last
treatment.
unknown
speaker
is
that
right?
unknown
speaker
that's
right,
okay.
unknown
speaker
of
course,
in
tulsa,
the
claim
was
cut
off
completely.
unknown
speaker
here
there's
just
a
procedure
established
to
defer
its
adjudication.
unknown
speaker
how
in
your
opinion
is
the
insurance
company
supposed
to
deal...
in
your
opinion
under
the
constitution
as
you
see
it...
with
a
claim
that's
clearly
fraudulent,
vastly
overstated?
is
it
supposed
to
just
pay
the
bill?
the
constitution
requires
it
to
pay
this
bill
regardless
and
then
try
to
get
its
money
back
after
these
hearings,
et
cetera,
or
not?
unknown
speaker
i'm
asking
how
you--
unknown
speaker
--can
you
just
say...
do
they
have
to
pay
the
bill
initially
and
then
try
to
get
the
money
back,
even
the
clearly
fraudulent
ones?
unknown
speaker
thank
you,
ms.
mckinley.
mr.
mcconnell,
you
have
1
minute
remaining.
