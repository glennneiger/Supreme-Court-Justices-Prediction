chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
number
97
1235,
the
city
of
monterey
v.
del
monte
dunes,
et
cetera.
mr.
yuhas.
is
that
the
correct
pronunciation
of
your
name?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
are
you
saying
that
the
jury
was
not
entitled
to
consider
the
length
of
time
that
these
proceedings
were
underway
at
all?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
long
were
they
underway,
from
beginning
to
end?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
happened
between
1986
and
now?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we
have
a
lawsuit
here.
surely
the
lawsuit
must
have
begun
sometime
after
1986,
one
hopes.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
surely
a
jury
could
be
charged
on
that.
juries
decide
all
sorts
of
questions
where
they
get
legal
instructions
from
the
judge
and
they
decide
the
factual
component
of
the
question.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
juries
decide
questions
of
land
value
all
the
time
in
the
state
courts
in
condemnation
actions.
california,
arizona--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
if
the
commission,
instead
of
saying
no,
you
can't...
we'll
reject
your
plan
five
times,
says,
we're
going
to
reject
it
for
100
units
but
we'll
approve
it
for
10
units?
now,
there
the
owner
can't
say
it
was
denied
all
economic
value,
but
isn't
it
possible
that
an
element
of
bad
faith
would
come
in
somewhere
along
the
lines
of
justice
scalia...
i'm
not
saying
it
happened
here,
but
if
a
jury
or
a
finder
of
fact
was
convinced
that
the
city
council
was
simply
going
through
motions
here,
that
it
was
determined
not
to
really
appraise
the
situation
in
the
light
of
the
ordinance,
couldn't
a
finder
of
fact,
either
a
jury
or
a
judge,
say
that
an
element
of
bad
faith
plays
a
part
in
the
decision?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--thank
you,
mr.
yuhas.
mr.
kneedler,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
was
that
challenged
by
the
petitioner,
the
agins
rule?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
ordinarily
we
don't
accept
any
new
questions
or
positions
from
an
amicus.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
that's
not
any
particular
justification
for
taking
a
new
point
from
an
amicus.
you're
simply
saying
you
think
it's
wrong.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
presumably
all
new
points
from
amicus
are
based
on
that.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
kneedler.
mr.
berger,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what
cases
are
you
referring
to,
mr.
berger?
you
said
the
last
two
cases
from
our
court
in
response
to
justice
ginsburg.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it's
certainly
not
academic
in
your
case,
though,
is
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
in--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--in
california,
state
condemnation
is
a
jury
trial,
is
it
not,
because
arizona
it
is,
and
we
patterned
ours
after
california,
unlike
the
federal
system
where
it
is
not.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
the
petitioner
framed
the
question
he
chose
to
put
it
in
terms
of
regulatory
takings
and
not
to
challenge
the
equal
protection.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
ah...
excuse
me.
go
ahead.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
in
the
jett
case
that
you
referred
to
and
the
other...
did
the
court
look
at
it,
the
jury
trial
right,
as
a
statutory
thing,
or
did
they
analyze
it
in
terms
of
the
seventh
amendment?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the...
1983
required
a
jury
trial.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you.
thank
you,
mr.
berger.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
97-1235,
the
city
of
monterey
versus
del
monte
dunes
of
monterey
will
be
announced
by
justice
kennedy.
