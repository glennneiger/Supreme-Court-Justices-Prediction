david
h.
souter
well,
may
i
try--
justice
david
h.
souter
would
this
be
a...
mr.
kneedler,
would
this
be
a
possible
different
way
of
looking
at
it
in
nonprocedural
terms?
we...
the
discussion
up
to
this
point
has
been
largely
in
terms
of
the
language
that
was
used
in
agins,
but
if
you
look
at
the
penn
central
multifactor
formulation,
one
of
the
sort
of
broad
subjects
to
be
addressed
is
the
nature
of
the
governmental
action,
and
if
we
take
that
into
consideration
properly,
isn't
the
issue
of
bad
faith
something
that
may
be
considered
right
up
front
under
that
particular
heading?
justice
david
h.
souter
so
you're
saying
this
is
not
a
temporary
taking
case.
that
isn't
what--
justice
david
h.
souter
--did
the
jury
instructions
advert
to
the
issue
that
the
action
was
brought
by
the
buyer,
whereas
i
guess
chronologically
most
of
the
temporary
taking,
if
that's
what
there
was,
occurred
during
the
ownership
of
the
previous
owner,
the
prior
buyer
shows
inaction.
justice
david
h.
souter
i
see.
justice
david
h.
souter
what
if
we
assumed--
justice
david
h.
souter
but
if
we
read
agins
the
way
justice
stevens
said
he
remembered,
or
he
thought
was
intended,
then
we
really
would
have
a
conflict,
wouldn't
we,
because
justice
stevens...
i
hope
i
don't
misstate
him,
but
he
said
that
he
thought
of
the
agins
test,
or
had
at
one
point
thought
of
the
agins
test
as
being
essentially
an
absolute
irrationality
kind
of
test,
and
if
that's
the
case,
then
we
really
would
have
a
conflict
between
what
the
court
found
and
what
the
jury
was...
would
have
apparently
found
here.
