justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
could
you...
suppose
you
told
the
jury,
the
issue
for
you
to
decide
is,
was
the
decision
based
on
reason?
did
it
substantially
advance
a
legitimate
public
goal?
could
the
jury
answer
that
question?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
that
was
your
argument
to
the
jury.
i've
read
the
record.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you
said,
did
it
substantially
advance
a
legitimate
goal?
you
said
that's
the
issue
for
the
jury,
and
you
said
the
issue
for
you
to
decide
was
the
decision
based
on
reason.
those
are
two
questions,
and
you
said
those
are
presented
here,
and
it
seems
to
me
that
the
past
history
of
what
the
developer
was
required
to
do
is
relevant
to
that.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--well,
you
cast
the
case
as
if
the
jury
is
going
to
be
assessing
the
reasonableness
of
the
zoning
ordinance,
but
that's
not
what
the
jury
was
instructed.
that's
not
what
you
argued
to
the
jury.
that's
not
what
mr.
jacobson
argued.
they
said,
was
this
decision
a
reasonable
implementation
of
that
ordinance,
and
that's
different,
and
juries
talk
about
reasonableness
all
the
time.
that's
the
whole
law
of
torts.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
you
instruct
the
jury
that
the
city
is
entitled
to
the
greatest
of
deference
and
leeway,
but
that
if
they
have
been
unreasonable
or,
say
in
bad...
suppose
the
jury's...
the
planning
commissioner
is
in
bad
faith
in
implementing
the
ordinance,
could
that
question
go
to
the
jury?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
could
that
question--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--in
a
proper
case
go
to
the
jury?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
of
course,
the
jury
wasn't
instructed
on
that
theory.
the
oral
arguments
weren't
on
that
theory.
i'm
not
sure
why
that
issue
is
in
the
case
if
the
verdict
can
be
sustained
on
another
basis.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
and
in
california
juries
do,
in
precondemnation
delay
cases,
for
instance,
decide
whether
the
state
was
unreasonable
in
delaying
condemnation
activity
under
coppin,
i
take
it.
that's
a
jury
question,
isn't
it?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it
seems
a
little
odd
to
me,
perhaps
to
you,
too,
given
your
representation
in
the
case
in
your
client's
position,
that
the
judge
would
find
as
a
matter
of
law
that
the
planning
action
was
substantively
reasonable
under
due
process
but
then
submit
the
takings
issue
to
a
jury.
that
does
seem
to
me
somewhat
inconsistent.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
of
course,
i
suppose
we
could
sustain
your
verdict
by
saying
the
judge
was
wrong
and
the
jury
was
right.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
on
the
jury
trial
issue
there's
been
some
mention
in
the
brief
that
the
judge
would
have
discretion
to
submit
this
to
the
jury
anyway,
and
so
maybe
that
issue
isn't
before
us,
either.
but
assuming
the
question
is
before
us
whether
or
not
there
is
a
right
to
jury
trial,
what
is
the
best
case
you
have
for
the
proposition
that
there
is,
that
there
is
a
right
to
jury
trial
on
this
issue
under
1983?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
chauffeurs
and
terry
and
tull,
are
those
the
two
you
have?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
the
respondents
here
were
property
owners,
they
owned
parcel
in
excess
of
37
acres
of
real
estate
within
the
city
limits
of
monterey,
california.
those
who
know
monterey
will
know
the
property
is
to
the
west
as
you
enter
the
city
from
the
north
on
highway
one.
the
parcel
therefore
has
some
ocean
frontage,
but
it
is
also
the
former
site
of
an
oil
company
terminal
and
a
tank
firm,
and
the
property
suffered
from
this
industrial
use.
the
owners
sought
to
restore
the
property
to
good
condition
as
part
of
a
proposed
residential
development.
over
the
period
of
some
five
years
the
owner
submitted
repeated
plans,
each
time
trying
to
meet
the
conditions
imposed
by
city
planning
officials.
these
included
restoring
natural
vegetation
to
save
an
endangered
butterfly
species,
providing
a
public
beach,
providing
view
corridors
and
a
buffer
zone
next
to
a
state
park.
with
each
submission
however
they
were
confronted
with
new
demands
by
planning
officials.
the
zoning
ordinance
would
have
permitted
the
residential
development
of
more
than
1,000
units,
but
the
initial
proposal
was
for
344
units.
after
the
first
plan
was
denied
each
later
proposal
proposed
a
reduced
number
of
dwelling
units,
the
last
being
for
just
190
units,
still
the
proposal
was
denied.
after
five
years
19
different
site
plans
and
five
formal
planning
decisions
all
resulting
in
denials,
then
owner,
respondent
del
monte
dunes,
decided
the
city
would
not
permit
development
under
any
circumstances.
under
california
law
as
it
then
was,
the
party
seemed
to
agree
that
the
owners
could
not
have
sued
the
city
for
just
compensation
based
on
a
regulatory
takings
theory,
so
they
brought
this
suit
under
the
federal
civil
rights
statute
42
u.s.c.
1983.
the
suit
alleged
the
violation
of
the
federal
constitution.
the
theory
of
the
suit
was
that
the
city
had
taken
the
property
through
his
actions,
and
that
del
monte
dunes
had
neither
paid
for
the
taking
nor
provided
a
remedy
for
seeking
just
compensation.
just
as
the
planning
and
permit
processes
were
protracted
so
too
were
the
legal
proceedings,
and
they’re
described
in
the
opinion,
eventually,
the
case
was
tried
to
a
jury
in
the
united
states
district
court.
the
verdict
was
returned
in
favor
of
the
landowners
and
against
the
city
and
court
of
appeals
affirmed.
we
granted
certiorari
to
determine
three
questions:
the
first
is
whether
the
court
of
appeals
erred
in
assuming
that
the
rough
proportionality
standard
of
our
recent
holding
in
dolan
versus
city
of
tigard
applies
to
this
case?
although
in
a
general
sense
concerns
for
proportionality
animate
the
takings
clause,
the
rough
proportionality
test
of
the
dolan
case
has
not
been
applied
except
in
the
special
context.
it
has
been
applied
to
land
use
decisions
which
condition
the
approval
of
development
on
consent
by
the
owners
to
dedicate
part
of
the
owner’s
property
to
a
public
use.
that
was
not
the
essential
objection
the
landowner
made
in
this
case.
for
this
reason
we
believe
the
test
was
not
applicable
here,
there
were
other
basis
upon
which
to
sustain
the
trial
court’s
instructions
and
the
jury’s
verdict
however,
so
the
court
of
appeals'
discussion
of
rough
proportionality
is
not
ground
either
for
reversal
or
for
remand.
the
second
question
was
whether
the
trial
court
erred
by
using
a
standard
that
allowed
the
jury
to
reweigh
the
reasonableness
of
the
city’s
land
use
decision?
the
standard
or
test
to
which
the
city
objects
was
in
effect
contained
in
an
instruction
proposed
by
the
city
itself,
and
as
to
which
there
was
no
objection.
the
jury
was
asked
to
decide
in
light
of
the
history
and
context
of
this
particular
case
whether
the
denial
of
the
landowners’
development
proposal
was
reasonably
related
to
the
city’s
profit
justification.
to
the
extent
the
city
argues
that
its
land
use
decisions
are
immune
from
judicial
scrutiny
under
all
circumstances,
its
position
is
contrary
to
settle
regulatory
takings
principles.
so,
we
reject
this
claim
of
error.
the
third
question
is
the
one
to
which
the
opinion
for
the
court
and
the
other
separate
opinions
devote
most
discussion.
that
question
is
whether
the
issue
of
the
city’s
liability
was
properly
submitted
to
the
jury
rather
than
to
the
trial
judge?
on
this
ground
too
we
affirm
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals.
this
was
a
suit
as
mentioned
at
the
outset,
under
section
1983.
section
1983
suits
we
hold
are
statutory
claims
which
can
be
said
to
sound
in
tort.
we
hold
that
a
party,
which
like
del
monte
dunes,
seeks
legal
relief
under
1983
is
guaranteed
a
jury
trial
by
the
seventh
amendment.
in
actions
of
law
predominantly
factual
issues
are
in
most
cases
allocated
to
the
jury.
the
allocation
rest
on
a
firm
historical
foundation
and
serve
to
preserve
the
right
to
a
jury’s
resolution
of
the
ultimate
dispute.
almost
from
the
inception
of
our
regulatory
takings
doctrine,
we
have
held
that
whether
a
regulation
of
property
goes
so
far
that
there
must
be
an
exercise
of
eminent
domain,
and
compensation
to
sustain
the
action,
depends
upon
the
particular
facts.
we
conclude
that
whether
a
landowner
who
has
been
deprived
of
all
economically
viable
use
of
his
property
is
a
predominantly
factual
question.
in
actions
of
law
otherwise
within
the
purview
of
the
seventh
amendment
this
question
is
for
the
jury.
the
jury’s
role
in
determining
whether
a
land
use
decision
substantially
advances
legitimate
public
interest
within
the
meaning
of
our
regulatory
takings
doctrine
presents
a
more
difficult
question.
in
this
case
the
issues
submitted
to
the
jury
was
narrow
and
fact
bound.
under
the
circumstances
it
was
proper
for
the
jury’s
determination.
justice
scalia
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
part
and
concurring
in
the
judgment;
justice
souter
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
part
and
dissenting
in
part.
in
that
opinion
justices
o’connor,
ginsburg
and
breyer
have
joined.
