mr.
michael
m.
berger
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court--
i
suppose
i
ought
to
start
out
by
referring
to
justice
breyer's
question
and
answer
it.
this
is
a
temporary
takings
case.
this
property
was
taken
for
a
finite
period
of
time
which
the
jury
found
under
instructions
that
were,
by
the
way,
drafted
by
the
city.
the
city
got
the
jury
instructed
with
everything
that
it
wanted
and
presumably
could
have
offered
more
if
it
didn't
like
the
instructions
it
had.
mr.
michael
m.
berger
that's
my
reading
of
this
court's
cases
as
well,
justice
ginsburg.
mr.
michael
m.
berger
i
would
have
to
say
that's
not
as
clear
as
counsel
for
the
city
represented.
mr.
michael
m.
berger
oh,
actually
i
thought
that
that
was
justice
ginsburg's
reference.
i
think
she
was
referring--
mr.
michael
m.
berger
--williamson
and
probably
first
english--
mr.
michael
m.
berger
--that
mandated
compensation
as
a
remedy
for
a
regulatory
taking.
mr.
michael
m.
berger
that
is
correct.
the--
mr.
michael
m.
berger
--this
case
arose
in
1986,
1
year
before
first
english,
at
a
time
when
california
recognized
no
compensatory
remedy.
mr.
michael
m.
berger
it
could
have
little
continuing
importance,
i
would--
mr.
michael
m.
berger
--in
this
case
it
was
the
heart
of
the
case.
mr.
michael
m.
berger
your
honor,
there
are
many
of
those
kinds
of
cases
in
california,
and
i
would
have
to
say
i
cannot
put
my
finger
on
a
citation
to
an
appellate
decision
that
deals
with
the
issue.
i
can
assure
the
court
we've
tried
cases
like
that
in
california
that
have
gone
to
juries--
mr.
michael
m.
berger
--and
without
objection.
that's
why
it
doesn't
go
up.
mr.
michael
m.
berger
yes,
your
honor,
but
of
course
the
only
issue
in
a
direct
condemnation
case
would
be
the
valuation
of
the
property,
a
major
distinction
between
the
kind
of
case
we
have
here
and
a
condemnation
case,
but
in
california
those
issues,
the
only
issues
that
are
left,
the
valuation
issues,
are
decided
by
juries.
mr.
michael
m.
berger
i'm
hesitating,
justice
ginsburg,
only
because
there
have
been
so
few
of
them
that
have
reached--
mr.
michael
m.
berger
--they're
very
unlikely
to
make
an
appearance
in
the
way
that
this
case
did,
because
this
court
has
ordered
california
to
recognize
compensation
as
a
remedy.
to
the
extent
that
california
complies
with
that,
and
some
of
us
think
that
it
pays
only
lip
service,
these
cases
will
not
be
filed
at
least
in
the
first
instance
in
federal
district
court.
but
getting
back
to
the
reasonableness
issue
that
counsel
spent
so
much
time
on,
this
is
not
something
that
i
think
was
invented
for
this
case.
it
was
not
something
that
was
even
invented
in
agins.
this
court's
jurisprudence
on
regulatory
takings
is
based
on
a
determination
by
a
court,
whether
it
be
a
judge
or
a
jury,
of
the
reasonableness
of
the
conduct
of
the
governmental--
mr.
michael
m.
berger
--well,
your
honor,
there
are
certainly
some
due
process
aspects
that
could
be
raised
in
such
a
case.
they
can't,
by
the
way,
be
raised
in
the
ninth
circuit
any
longer.
we
briefed
this
in
our
brief
pointing
out
to
the
court
that
in
an
en
banc
decision
in
a
case
called
armendariz
v.
penman
the
ninth
circuit
has
decided
that
all
property
owner
claims
related
to
constitutional
infirmities
have
to
be
brought
as
takings
claims
and
cannot
be
brought
as
due
process
claims.
there's
an
eleventh
circuit
opinion
in
a
case
called
villas
of
lake
jackson
v.
leon
county
that
reaches
that
same
conclusion.
so
there
are
some
due
process
sounding
concerns
in
these
cases,
but
at
least
in
the
part
of
the
country
where
we
live
we
can't
raise
those
on
behalf
of
property
owners.
mr.
michael
m.
berger
well,
let
me
say
at
least
i
was
disappointed
in
that
result,
your
honor,
but
i
don't
think
that...
i
don't
think
it's
terribly
inconsistent.
it
depends
on
the
standard
of
review
that
one
uses
in
these
two
different
questions,
and
when
you
look
at
the
standard
of
review
for
a
due
process
violation
it's
a
very
low
threshold
that
the
city
has
to
climb.
it's
a
determination
that
the
city
did
not
act
arbitrarily,
and
once
the
court
makes
that
determination,
as
i
think
it
could
make
legitimately
in
this
case,
which
is
why
we
did
not
appeal
that
finding,
the
city
did
not
act
arbitrarily.
that
doesn't
mean
that
the
impact
of
what
it
did
to
this
property
owner
in
applying
its
general
planning
and
zoning
laws
did
not
result
in
a
taking.
mr.
michael
m.
berger
it
was
not
a
reasonable
way
for
the
city
to
effectuate--
mr.
michael
m.
berger
--i
think
in
that
sense,
yes,
but
i
think
that
it
could
also
pass
an
arbitrary
standard
under
a
due
process
examination,
and
i
think
that's
what
happened
here.
mr.
michael
m.
berger
i...
justice
breyer,
i
have
to
confess
that
i
have
trouble
understanding
some
of
this
case
as
well.
i
believe
that
what
the
city
is
trying
to
do
is
to
get
this
court
to
review
the
standards
by
which
takings,
either
permanent
or
temporary,
are
evaluated,
but
i...
it
feels
to
me
as
though
a
temporary
taking,
where
the
jury
looks
at
what's
going
on
and
looks
at
the
period
of
time,
as
it
was
instructed
to
do.
whether
the
action
was
reasonable
or
unreasonable,
whether
it
was
proportional
or
not
proportional,
if
they
determine
that
there
was
a
period
of
time
during
which
there
was
a
complete
taking
of
this
property,
which
it
appears
that
they
did,
then
i
would
agree
that
those
other
questions
on
the
substantive
merits
of
the
case
become
irrelevant.
mr.
michael
m.
berger
yes.
mr.
michael
m.
berger
that's
correct,
justice
scalia.
they
were
told,
in
the
words
of
this
court's
decision
in
agins,
that
they
could
find
a
taking
either
if
it...
the
city's
actions
failed
to
substantially
advance
a
legitimate
state
interest,
or
if
it
denied
the
property
owner
economically
viable
use.
mr.
michael
m.
berger
justice
ginsburg,
the...
as
i
read
the
record
in
this
case
the
equal
protection
issue
is
not
before
the
court.
the
ninth
circuit--
mr.
michael
m.
berger
--i
believe
that
it
was,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
m.
berger
we
got
a
general
verdict
from
the
jury.
mr.
michael
m.
berger
i
believe
that
they
examined
each
of
those
things
independently.
they
were
instructed--
mr.
michael
m.
berger
--the--
mr.
michael
m.
berger
--it
was...
it
has
not
been
briefed
in
this
court.
it
was
the
ninth
circuit
expressly
did
not
deal
with
the
equal
protection
issue.
mr.
michael
m.
berger
that's
certainly
true,
as
the...
i
believe
in
the...
either
in
the
petition
or
in
the
petitioner's--
mr.
michael
m.
berger
--your
honor,
i
believe
that
the
verdict
form
did
distinguish
between
the
equal
protection
and
the
takings,
and
that
the
jury
found
that
there
was
a
violation--
mr.
michael
m.
berger
--it
was
general
within
the
takings
realm,
so
that
we
have
these
unanswered
questions
of
which
prong
of
the
agins
formulation
the
jury
may
or
may
not
have
ruled
on,
and
how
they
determined
what
the
amount
of
compensation
was.
mr.
michael
m.
berger
the
jury
found
both,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
m.
berger
that's
right.
mr.
michael
m.
berger
yes,
your
honor,
that's
the
way
it
looks
here.
mr.
michael
m.
berger
well,
it
seems
to
me,
justice
stevens,
that
this
case
may
be
an
excellent
example
of
that
kind
of
a
determination,
as
i
think
that
the
court
of
appeals
properly
analyzed.
what
we
had
here
was
a
jury
examining
whether
it
was
a
reasonable
way
to
achieve
the
city's
environmental
goals
to
completely
frustrate
the
development
of
this
property,
and
the
jury
decided
that
that
was
such
an
extreme
misconnection
between
ends
and
means
that
it
failed
to
substantially
advance
legitimate
state
interests.
mr.
michael
m.
berger
even
though
you
could
say
that
there
was
a
reason--
mr.
michael
m.
berger
--why
they
did
it.
mr.
michael
m.
berger
if
the
court
wanted
to
do
that
we'd
certainly--
mr.
michael
m.
berger
--that's
correct.
mr.
michael
m.
berger
justice
stevens,
you're
correct
that
we
did
not
appeal
from
the
due
process
holding.
as
it
turns
out
in
hindsight,
if
we
had
appealed
the
ninth
circuit's
intervening
decision
in
armendariz
would
have
resulted
in
a
conclusion
that
we
had
no
due
process
claim
in
any
event,
but
that's--
mr.
michael
m.
berger
--the...
well,
there
are
no
cases
from
this
court,
i
believe,
that
has
directly
dealt
with
a...
the
right
to
a
jury
trial
in
a
1983
case.
mr.
michael
m.
berger
there
are
two
cases
that
this
court
has
decided.
mr.
michael
m.
berger
chauffeurs
is
a
good
discussion
of
the
jury
trial
analysis.
the
cases
that
i
was
thinking
of
were
jett
v.
dallas
independent
school
district
and
hetzel
v.
prince
william
county,
both
of
them
1983
cases.
in
jett
this
court
determined
that
after
the
district
court
decided
a
question
of
law
as
to
who
the
appropriate
decisionmaker
was
in
a
municipality
then
the
remainder
of
the
determination
of
liability,
whether
that
decisionmaker's
actions
resulted
in
section
1983
liability
would
be
decided
by
the
jury.
in
the
hetzel
case,
decided
i
think
this
last
term,
this
court
reversed
a
determination
by
the
seventh
circuit
when
the
seventh
circuit
attempted
to
reduce
a
jury
verdict
and
this
court
said
you
can't
do
that.
they
had
a
right
to
have
a
jury
determine
this
issue,
and
the
court
of
appeals
cannot
arbitrarily--
mr.
michael
m.
berger
--well,
they
certainly
wouldn't
have
had
any
inclination
to
tinker
with
the
seventh
amendment,
justice
o'connor,
if
that's
your--
mr.
michael
m.
berger
--your
honor,
i'm
sorry
that
it
struck
the
court
as
strange,
but
i
was
doing
that
because
of
this
court's
earlier
decisions,
which
said
that
the
first
thing
to
examine
in
determining
whether
there's
a
jury
trial
right
is
the
statute,
and
only
after
having
exhausted
the
statute
do
we
turn
to
the
seventh
amendment
itself.
that's
why
in
our
brief
we
analyzed
it
both
ways
as
did,
i
believe,
the
court
of
appeals
here,
and
concluded
that
the
drafters
of
section
1983,
when
they
said
that
a
plaintiff
at
his
or
her
option
could
file
an
action
at
law
or
a
suit
in
equity
or
some
other
appropriate
proceeding,
was
giving
the
plaintiff
the
right
to
choose--
mr.
michael
m.
berger
--the
kind
of
action
he
wanted.
mr.
michael
m.
berger
not
from
the
face
of
1983.
mr.
michael
m.
berger
the
hetzel
case
was
clearly
a
seventh
amendment
analysis.
the
jett
case
i
believe
was
a
1983
analysis.
mr.
michael
m.
berger
i
can't
push
it
that
far,
your
honor.
the
court
didn't
directly
deal
with
the
question
of
whether
the
statute
required
a
jury
trial.
what
the
court
dealt
with
was
how
to
divide
the
issues
in
the
case
to
determine
whether
a
judge
decided
the
issues
or
a
jury
decided
the
issues,
and
what
the
court
decided
was
that
the
jury
would
decide
liability
once
the
judge
had
determined
as
a
matter
of
law
which
municipal
official
was
the
actual
decision
making
body.
mr.
michael
m.
berger
your
honor,
all
of
the
jury
instructions
were
drafted
by
the
city.
mr.
michael
m.
berger
everything
the
city
wanted
they
got.
mr.
michael
m.
berger
they
did
object
to
the
trial,
yes.
mr.
michael
m.
berger
yes.
mr.
michael
m.
berger
that's
correct.
mr.
michael
m.
berger
justice
breyer,
let
me
try
answering
it
this
way,
because
bad
faith
per
se
was
not
an
issue
that
was
raised
directly
in
the
trial.
what
the
jury
got
was
the
entire
history
of
this
case
from
the
time
that
the
first
application
was
filed
in
1981,
the
entire
5
year
history
of
administrative
proceedings
from
1981
through
1986,
all
of
the
trips
that
were
made
to
the
planning
commission,
all
of
the
revisions
that
were
requested,
all
of
the
revisions
that
were
made,
and
they
heard
the
biologist
who
was
processing
the
reclamation
plan
on
behalf
of
the
developer
testify
about
what
he
did,
how
he
worked
with
the
city
staff,
with
the
coastal
commission
staff,
how
they
accepted
and
incorporated
all
of
the
suggestions
that
were
made
by
any
of
the
expert
agencies,
unless
they,
for
example,
conflicted
with
one
of
the
other
city's
requirements.
i
remember
one
place
in
the--
mr.
michael
m.
berger
--that
is
correct,
justice
ginsburg.
motive
was
not
an
issue
that
was
submitted
to
the
jury.
mr.
michael
m.
berger
well,
i
believe,
justice
ginsburg,
it
doesn't
make
any
difference,
because,
as
the
court
of
appeals
explained,
the
evidence
amply
supports
both
prongs
of
that
agins
test,
and
therefore
whichever
way
the
jury
went,
and
they
may
well
have
gone
both
ways,
it's
supported
by
the
evidence
in
the
record.
mr.
michael
m.
berger
i
think,
justice
o'connor,
it
has
to
do
with
the
level
of
examination
that
goes
on
in
a
due
process
case
as
opposed
to
a
takings
case.
mr.
michael
m.
berger
i
believe
that
the
essential
due
process
inquiry
simply
looks
on
its
face
at
what
the
city
said
it
was
doing,
and
if
the
city
said
we
are
basing
this
determination
on
our
conclusion
that
we
need
to
protect
this
habitat
for
a
butterfly
that
nobody's
ever
seen
there,
then
that
is
sufficient
to
get
the
city
past
the
extremely
low
threshold
of
review
that
happens
in
a
due
process
case.
i
think
when
the
matter
gets
submitted
to
a
determination
of
whether
there's
a
substantial
advancement
of
legitimate
state
interest,
the
jury
in
this
case
or
a
judge
if
it
didn't
go
to
a
jury
would
be
entitled
to
look
at
what
the
city
is
trying
to
accomplish...
that
is,
to
set
up
a
butterfly
preserve...
and
look
at
the
means
that
it
adopted
to
get
there,
essentially
total
frustration
of
the
use
of
this
36
1/2
acre
parcel
of
property,
and
say,
is
this
an
appropriate
way
to
achieve
that
end
as
a
matter
of
fact,
and
i
think
that
that's
a
different
level
of
examination
than
you'd
get
when
you
just
look
at,
what
is
the
city's
rationalization
for
what
it
was
doing.
mr.
michael
m.
berger
it
would
appear
that
way,
justice
souter,
although
i
have
to
say
that
the
trial
judge
at
the
time
that
he
made
that
ruling
expressly
said
that
he
didn't
find
it
to
be
in
conflict.
mr.
michael
m.
berger
my
response
is
that
this
is
a
temporary
taking
case,
and
that
there
was
a
period
of
time
that
the
jury
found
that
this
property
had
no
use
and
no
particular
value
to
a
private
property
owner.
the
fact
that
they
actually
sold
the
property
at
some
later
date--
mr.
michael
m.
berger
--sure.
the
difference,
and
i
agree
with
you,
justice
stevens,
because
that's
what
the
court
said
in
first
english,
that
there
is
this
period
of
delay
during
normal
planning,
although
i
think
that
the
developer
here
in
5
years
went
sort
of
overboard
in
the
normal
planning
process
trying
to
find
something
that
would
satisfy
the
city.
but
what
we
have
here,
as
the
trial
court
instructed
the
jury,
that
they
should
focus
their
attention
in
awarding
damages
for
a
temporary
taking
from
the
time
in
1986
when
the
permit
was
finally
denied,
the
fifth
permit
application
was
denied,
until
sometime
between
then
and
the
date
of
trial,
so
that
it
wasn't
that
normal
period
of
planning
and
waiting
and
trying
to
get
permits
that
was
compensated
in
this
case.
the
developer
was
essentially
told,
that's
your
problem.
you're
going
to...
you
went
through
all
that
process.
you'll
have
to
take
the
heat
for
that
one.
but
from
the
time
the
city
denied
the
permit
in
1986,
from
there
forward
the
jury
was
instructed
to
determine
what
the
period
of
delay
was
in
allowing
these
people
to
make
some
productive
use
of
either
their
property
or
its
monetary
equivalent,
and
to
find
a
monetary
equivalent
and
award
it.

that's
what
they
did.
mr.
michael
m.
berger
i
believe
it
did,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
m.
berger
i
believe
so,
although,
like
your
honor,
i--
mr.
michael
m.
berger
--if
it
was
not
appropriate
across
the
board--
mr.
michael
m.
berger
--it
certainly
would
not
have
been.
mr.
michael
m.
berger
i
believe
it
was
across
the
board
that
the
objection
was
raised.
mr.

the
fifth
amendment
is
a
critically
important
part
of
the
constitution.
it
was
applied
in
this
case.
it
was
enforced
in
this
case.
as
this
court
said
very
recently
in
the
dolan
case
the
fifth
amendment
is
not
to
be
considered
as
some
sort
of
poor
relation
in
the
bill
of
rights.
it
is
just
as
important
as
the
first
amendment
or
the
fourth
amendment.
the
reason
that
it's
important
is
that
people
like
this
developer
need
to
know
that
when
they
are
dealing
with
their
regulating
local
government
agencies
that
their
rights
are
protected,
that
they
can't
be
simply
strung
along
and
abused
at
the
city's
whim.
i
think,
looking
at
the
record
in
this
case
as
the
court
of
appeals
laid
it
out,
what
you
have
here
is
a
pattern
of
abuse,
if
you
will,
and
i
think
the
jury
was
entitled
to
look
at
that
pattern
that
existed
from
1981
when
the
first
application
for
use
of
this
land
was
made.
the
judiciary
in
general
and
this
court
in
particular
remains
the
only
hope
of
these
kind
of
people.
