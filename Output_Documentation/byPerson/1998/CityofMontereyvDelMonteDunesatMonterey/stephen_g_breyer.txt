justice
stephen
g.
breyer
could
the
jury
do
this.
this
is...
am
i
right...
help
me
with
this.
am
i
right
in
thinking
that
we're
reviewing
a
judgment
that
awarded
your
opponent
$1.45
million
for
a
temporary
taking,
which
i
take
it
was
for
the
period
of
time
from,
like
maybe
when
they
bought
the
land
or
something,
until
california
paid
the
$4.5
million,
or
4.8.
that
was
the
judgment
we're
reviewing.
i
may
not
have
it
precisely
right,
but
roughly.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
it's
a
temporary
taking.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
now,
if
that's
so,
and
if
i
believe
the
jury
could
assess
this
question,
had
it
during
that
time
been
deprived
of
all
value,
i
suppose
that's
a
jury
question
in
my
mind,
supposedly.
they
can
decide
that
question,
whether
or
not
all
value
disappears
from
the
property,
therefore
it
warrants...
and,
moreover,
the
jury
could
assess
the
amount.
if
i
believe
those
two
things,
is
there
any
reason
for
me
to
go
further
in
this
case?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
could
anyone
have
found...
could
anyone,
any
reasonable
person
have
doubted
that
the
property
lost
all
its
value
during
that
temporary
time?
is
there
some
evidence
here?
is
there
some
dispute?
i
mean,
i
know
there
is
a
dispute
as
to
whether
or
not,
when
they
got
paid
the
money
later...
i
mean,
you
had
4.8
million.
i
understand
that
dispute.
but
during
the
temporary
time,
is
there
any
dispute
that
it
had
no
value?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
there
was.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
there
any
value,
other
than
the
value
that
would
come
about
by
selling
it
to
the
state
for
the
use
as
a
seashore?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
when
you
get...
is
it
relevant
here?
it
keeps
coming
into
my
mind
that
the
damages
here
were
awarded
for
a
temporary
taking,
and
the
conditions
of
obtaining
damages
for
a
temporary
taking
are?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
is
the
fact?
what
do
the
court's
cases
say?
you
get
money
for
a
temporary
taking,
you
get...
does
the
total
value
have
to
be
destroyed?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
for
a
temporary
taking...
for
a
temporary
taking,
total
value
destroyed,
plus...
anything?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
if
it
has?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
see,
that's
what
keeps
bothering
me.
this
is
a
temporary
takings
case,
i
take
it,
and
everybody's
arguing
as
if
it's
not,
so
i
must
be
wrong,
but
why?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
if
this
is
basically
a
temporary
takings
case,
and
if...
and
here
i'm
not
certain...
the
point
of
the
temporary
takings
doctrine
is
to
stop,
say,
cities
from
giving
people
what
one
might
call
the
extreme
run
around,
all
right,
suppose
that's
the
point
of
it,
and
if
that's
so,
we
could
answer
the
first
question,
i
guess.
we
could
answer
the
first
question
and
say,
some
issues
anyway...
maybe
we'd
answer
it
in
your
favor,
i
don't
know.
assume
that
for
the
sake
of
argument.
but
the
second
and
third
questions,
how
would
we
even
get
to
them?
i
mean,
that's
what
i'm
having
trouble
with.
this
question
of
proportionality
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
temporary
takings
case,
i
would
think,
as...
at
least
if
it's
the
extreme
run
around.
i
don't
see
the
relationship.
nor
do
i
see
the
relationship
of
the
reweighing.
i
mean,
i
don't...
in
other
words,
i
don't
know
what
to
do
with
this
case
if
i
see
it
as
a
temporary
takings
case.
i
got
question
1.
i
guess
we
could
answer
that.
but
how
do
you
see
the
2
and
3
relating
to
this
case?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
you--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
it
in
that--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
it
the
case
at
the
trial
that
when
the
second
half,
that
the
city's
decision
to
reject
the
plaintiff's
unit
did
not
substantially
advance
a
legitimate
public
purpose...
that
was
the
second
half
of
the
basic
instruction.
did
your
opponents
say,
judge,
we
don't
want
to
submit
that
to
the
jury?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well
then--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--how
are
they
saying
now
that
the
error
is
that
it
was
submitted
to
the
jury,
if
they
didn't
object?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
to
the
whole
thing?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
to
the
whole
thing,
okay.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now,
was
there
an
element
in
this
case,
when
you
get
back
to
the
details
of
the
case,
which
had
to
do
not
with
whether
or
not
as
a
matter
of
law
the
city's
decision
was
reasonable
or
not,
but
as
to
what
factually
happened?
that
is,
was
there
bad
faith?
was
an
official
saying,
i
don't...
i
want
to
protect
the
butterfly,
or
was
saying
i
don't
want
to
protect
the
butterfly,
but
reality,
that
was
his
motive,
or...
was
there
a
factual
element
to
this,
or
was
it
simply
a
matter
of
the
lawfulness
of
a
city's,
or
the
reasonableness
of
a
set
of
facts
that
were
not
in
dispute?
