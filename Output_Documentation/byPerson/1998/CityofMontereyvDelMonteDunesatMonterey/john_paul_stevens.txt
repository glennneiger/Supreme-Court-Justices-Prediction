justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
in
asking
whether
the
decision
in
question
was
reasonable,
the
history
of
the
zoning
and
the
previous
attempts
are
relevant,
are
they
not,
in
determining
the
reasonableness
of
the
city's
action?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
what
the
chief
justice
is
asking,
and
i
think
it
was
prompted
by
justice
scalia's
question
in
my
mind
as
well,
let's
assume
that
the
city
is
unreasonable
in
the
implementation
of
its
planning
ordinances,
and
that
it's
in
bad
faith
in
the
implementation
of
its
planning
ordinance.
the
property
still
has
an
economically...
an
economic
viability.
is
there...
the
city
still
liable
in
damages
for
that
unreasonable
treatment
of
the
landowner?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
it
found
both
equal
protection
and
takings.
yes.
but
within
the
takings--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--this
is
the
concern
i
have.
i
hope
you'll
address
it
a
little.
the
first
prong
within
the
taking
is
not
substantially
advance
legitimate
state
interest
and
i
gather,
given
the
judge's
finding
that
there
was
no
substantive
due
process
violation,
it
was
nonarbitrary,
we're
saying
that
something
can
be
nonarbitrary
that
does
not
substantially
advance
legitimate
state
interests.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
i
frankly
had
not...
i
was
here
during...
i
had
thought
that
that
former
prong
meant
totally
irrational,
but
i
guess
it's...
i
guess
there's
some
intermediate
area
between
being
nonarbitrary
and
not
substantially
advancing.
justice
john
paul
stevens
even
though
it
was
not
arbitrary.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
--but
i
don't
think
we
could
say
that,
because
you
did
not
appeal
from
the
judge's
holding.
i
think
we
have
to
accept...
assume
that
for
purposes
of
this
case
the
judge
was
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
maybe
he
wasn't,
but
it
seems
to
me
that's
the
way
it
comes
to
us.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
certainly
one
can
draw...
i
mean,
the
language
is
different,
and
maybe
i
just...
you
know,
i
didn't
understand
what
was
going
on
at
the
time.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
the
other
question,
i'd
like
to
have
you
comment
just
to
be
sure
i
don't...
you
have
a
full
opportunity.
your
opponent
has
said
it's
perfectly
clear
that
they
could
not
have
relied
on
the
denying
economically
viable
use
of
the
land
because
he
sold
it
for
several
million
dollars.
what
is
your
response
to
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
wouldn't
that
always
be
true
in
any
case
in
which
time
is
required
to
make
a
zoning
decision?
there's
always
going
to
be
a
period
where
you
can't
start
construction
while
they
make
up
their
mind
and
there's
a
total
denial...
is
that
the
same?
is
there
a
difference
between
that
and
what
happened
here?
