five
times.
justice
antonin
scalia
this
was
the
fifth
plan
presented,
right?
each
one
was
successively
rejected
for
a
different
reason
each
time?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
this
is
typical,
you
say?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
i
thought
they
did
that
five
times
to
try
to
get
a
better
restoration
plan.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
landowner
here
essentially
thinks
that
it
was
getting
jerked
around,
that
basically
the
city
didn't
want
this
land
used
for
anything
and
wanted
to
retain
it
empty
so
it
could
be
used
as
a
seashore.
that's
what
this
thing
is
about.
now,
let's
talk
about
deference
to
the
city's
judgment.
i
can
under...
our
normal
rule
is
that
we
do
defer
and,
if
there's
a
rational
basis,
that's
all
we
look
to.
but
where
you
have
a
consistent
process,
as
is
alleged
here,
of
turning
down
one
plan,
the
next
plan,
the
next
plan,
okay,
i'll
do
this
to
satisfy
you,
isn't
there
some
point
at
which,
although
there's
a
rational
basis
for
the
fifth
decision,
a
rational
basis
for
the
fourth
and
the
third
and
the
second
and
the
first,
you
begin
to
smell
a
rat,
and
at
that
point
can't
we
say,
despite
our
normal
rational
basis
review,
there's
some
other
factor
that
begins
to
come
in
here,
and
that
is,
at
some
point
you
can
say,
this
is
simply
unreasonable.
justice
antonin
scalia
--why
doesn't
it
come
under
the
other...
the
other
of
the
two
criteria?
why
do
you
insist
that
we
force
this
under
the
economically
viable
use
criteria
rather
than
under
whether
it
substantially
furthers
any
valid
purpose?
justice
antonin
scalia
not
if
there
was
bad
faith.
if
there
was
bad
faith
it
rationally
could
further
that
purpose
but
it
wasn't
being
used
for
that
purpose.
justice
antonin
scalia
--mr.
kneedler,
if
this
is...
granting,
for
the
sake
of
argument,
the
correctness
of
your
proposition
that
this
good
faith
factor
is
a
due
process
concern
ordinarily,
does
it
not
become
a
proper
concern
in
a
temporary
takings
case,
even
though
it
may
not
be
in
a
permanent
takings
case?
justice
antonin
scalia
because
the
argument
here
is
you've
effectively
taken
it
during
this
interim
period
by
jerking
me
around,
by
using
an
essentially
unfair
procedure
for
me
to
get
my
rights
under
the
existing
ordinance.
justice
antonin
scalia
maybe,
but
that's
what...
that's
why
there
has
been
a
taking,
because
you
have
not
used
a
fair
procedure,
and
so
at
least
in
the
temporary
takings
cases,
if
you
believe
in
temporary
takings...
maybe
you
don't
believe
in
temporary
takings
at
all,
but
once
you
acknowledge
there's
such
a
thing
as
a
temporary
taking,
what
else
produces
it
except...
except
an
unfair
procedure?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
we
don't
know
that
they
did.
the
thing
was
put
to
them
in
the
alternative.
justice
antonin
scalia
either
there
was
a
total
taking,
or.
justice
antonin
scalia
there's
been
no
claim
of
inadequacy
of
the
equal
protection
ground,
has
there
been?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
didn't
realize
that
question
was
here.
justice
antonin
scalia
then
it's
not
one
of
the
questions
presented
in
the
petition,
certainly.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
it
may
be
true,
but
i
didn't
know
we
were
going
to
have
to
grapple
with
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
--even
if
the
two
standards
are
the
same.
justice
antonin
scalia
--could
i
ask
about
the...
coming
back
to
the
jury
question,
the
objection
to
the
jury
request,
did
that
go
to
use
of
the
jury
for
any
of
the
issues
in
the
case?
justice
antonin
scalia
including
the
equal
protection?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
if
that
were
the
case
the
objection
wouldn't
be
sufficient
if
a
jury
would
be
appropriate
for
the
equal
protection
claim,
even
though
it
was
not
appropriate
for
the
taking
claim,
i
suppose.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes.
