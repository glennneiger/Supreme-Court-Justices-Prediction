justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
let's
talk
about...
we're
dealing
with
inverse
condemnation
here,
and
it's
a
two
part
inquiry
if
we
follow
agins.
i
don't
know
what
the
inquiry
is.
what
do
you
think
it
is?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
agins
says
two
things,
that
the
city's
action
has
to
substantially
advance
a
legitimate
purpose,
and
deny
the
subject
property
all
economically
viable
use.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
they
found
on
both
those
points
in
favor
of
the
respondents.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
they
gave
a
general
verdict.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
was
it
an
and
or
an
or
instruction?
were
they
told
to
find
that--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--it
takes
both,
or
were
they
told
either
one?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
it
was
a
general
verdict.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
even
if
we
were
to
conclude
that
there
were
one
or
more
issues
in
here
that
were
legal
issues
for
the
court,
it
wouldn't
require
a
new
trial
because
the
court
could
look
at
the
evidence
and
resolve
it
anyway.
it's
not
like
we're
having
to
send
it
back
for
a
new
trial,
regardless
of
the
answer.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
there
are
certainly
some
factual
issues
here,
like
economically
viable
use,
that
traditionally
would
go
to
a
jury,
it
seems
to
me.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
absolutely.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
suppose
we
agree
with
you
that
the
court
of
appeals
got
it
wrong
on
the
dolan
point,
what
is...
how
would
reversing
that,
or
vacating
it,
affect
the
balance
of
the
decision,
if
at
all?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
do
you--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--do
you
take
the
position
that
the
legitimacy
of
the
government
purpose
is
irrelevant
to
the
inverse
condemnation
question?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
that's
hard
to
derive
from
agins,
certainly.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
does
that
derive,
do
you
agree,
from
due
process
concerns?
i
mean,
it's
basically
whether
it's
sufficiently
arbitrary
to
violate
due
process.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
i
would
have
thought
we'd
look
to
the
seventh
amendment
in
a
federal
court
case
to
decide
whether
a
jury
should
decide
a
particular
issue
or
case,
and
not
to
section
1983.
i
mean,
there's
no
indication,
is
there,
that
the
drafters
of
section
1983
were
trying
to
tinker
with
what
the
seventh
amendment
required
and
say
every
case
could
go
to
a
jury
at
plaintiff's
option?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
no.
i
mean,
it
just...
i
don't
know,
i
thought
your
argument
on
that
was
very
strange,
and
that
we
should
look
to
the
seventh
amendment
for
what
goes
to
a
jury.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
oh,
but
i
would
think
you'd--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--yes,
but
you'd
have
to
look
at
this
temporary
takings
claim
and
try
to
analogize
it
to
something
to
figure
out
whether
there's
a
right
to
a
jury
trial
or
not.
i
don't
think
you'd
derive
that
from
the
face
of
1983.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
no.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--well,
how
is
it
amply
supported
if
the
ninth
circuit
says
that
there's
no
arbitrariness
within
the
meaning
of
the
due
process
clause?
that's
where
we
get
tangled
up.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--how
is
it
different
in
your
view,
the
inquiry
of
the
substantial
relationship
to
a
legitimate
city
purpose?
how
does
that
really
differ
from
the
essential
due
process
inquiry?
