justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
may
i
ask
about
that
ripeness
challenge,
and
it
relates
to
how
significant
this
jury
trial
issue
is
because,
as
i
understand
it,
the
ninth
circuit
said
it
was
ripe
because
at
the
time
california
had
no
proceeding
which
the
developer
could
bring,
but
now
california
does
and,
as
i
understand
our
case
law,
a
developer
in
the
situation
that
this
one
is
in
would
be
obliged
to
go
to
the
state
court,
not
federal
court,
is
that
correct?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
under
the
california
procedure
the
liability
issue
would
not
go
to
a
jury.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
is
there,
now
that
the
states
have
been
told
that
they
must
have
these
proceedings,
is
this
question
of
jury
trial
or
not
just
a
question
for
these
cases
hanging
over
from
the
eighties?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
does
it
have
any
continuing
significance
at
all?
that's
my
question,
because
if
there's
no
ripe
challenge
until
we've
gone
to
the
state,
the
state
would
decide
those
questions.
the
state
would
decide
the
liability
questions,
and
then
you
might
have
some
constitutional
question
about
it.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
berger,
i'd
like
to...
this
jury
trial
issue,
which
has
been
posed
as
a
discrete
issue,
i
have
it
in
my
mind,
and
i
may
be
wrong
about
this,
that
as
a
result
of
our
two
decisions,
williamson
the
last
one,
there
won't
be
any
ripe
claim
to
be
brought
in
the
federal
court
as
a
court
of
first
view
any
more,
because
the
inverse
condemnation
proceeding
will
take
place...
must
take
place
in
the
california
state
courts,
is
that
right?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
do
i
also
understand
that
these
two
questions,
the
economic
justification
or
deprivation,
that
under
the
california
law
the
liability
question,
that
is,
whether
there
has
been
a
taking,
is
done
by
the
judge?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
williamson
was
the
second
one.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes,
and
first
english...
yes.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
judge
wallace,
as
i
recall,
said
the
reason
this
case
is
ripe,
he
said
at
the
time
all
this
happened
california
did
not
have
those
procedures--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--in
place.
now
it
does.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
that's
why
this
whole
1983
jury
trial
or
not
seems
to
me
largely
academic,
not
having
any
continuing
importance.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
in
the
inverse
condemnation
case,
which
is
new
in
california,
how
is
that
division?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
i
don't
want
to
detract
you
on
that,
but
at
least
it's
my
understanding
that
these
cases
are
not
going
to
come
up
under
1983
now
the
way
they
did.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
berger,
if
the...
what
was
submerged
in
this
general
word
is
not
clear
to
me,
because
even
before
we
get
to
the
split
on
the
takings
there
was
also
an
equal
protection
claim.
as
i
understand
it,
the
jury
was
told
you
could
find
a
violation
of
equal
protection
or
unconstitutional
taking,
one
or
the
other,
and
how
can
we
just
uphold
this
verdict
without
saying
that
the
award
would
be
independently
sustainable
on
either
basis,
equal
protection
and
takings,
because
unless
there
was
a
special
verdict,
we
could
be
talking
about
takings
when
in
fact
the
jury
went
off
on
equal
protection.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
we
don't
know
what
the
jury
told
you
could
find
on
either
basis?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
do
we
know
which
one
the
jury
did
find
on?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
that's...
even
before
you
get
to
the
which
part
of
the
takings
analysis
was
it,
we
don't
even
know
whether
the
jury
ever
got
to
a
taking
question.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
we
can't
tell.
if
it's
a
general
verdict
they
could
have
gone
on
equal
protection
or
taking.
if
they
went
on
taking,
then
these
two
parts
they
could
have
gone
on,
either
or
there.
but
if...
i
don't
understand...
unless
we
agree
that
this
verdict
was
independently
sustainable
as
an
equal
protection
claim
or
a
takings
claim,
then
i
don't
understand
how
we
can
do
anything
with
it.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
my
only
point
is,
we
don't...
we
are
making
an
assumption
that
the
jury
went
on
the
takings
claim
when
there's
no
basis
for
that.
i
mean,
how
much
can
we
make
up?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
then
i
could
understand
this
case,
but
if
it
was
just
a
general
verdict,
so
we
don't
know--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--as
long
as
they
found
both,
the
jury
found
both,
then
i
have
no
problem
with
it.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
didn't
they
object
to
a
jury
trial
in
the
beginning?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
yuhas...
may
i
just
interrupt
to
clarify
what
mr.
yuhas
said,
and
if
this
is
wrong
please
tell
me,
that
the
motive,
bad
faith
and
motive
were
not
made
issues
in
this
case?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
what
was
submitted
to
the
jury
was
either
or,
and
can
you
explain
to
me
now
why
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
that
we
don't
know
whether
it
was
the
substantially
justified
or
the
no
economic
value
that
the
jury
in
fact
determined?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you
don't
remember...
as
i
remember,
the
position
was,
this
action
is
not
triable
to
a
jury.
this
action,
equal
protection,
due
process
taking,
goes
to
a
judge.
i
think
that
was--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--that
was
my
recollection.
