mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court--
before
discussing
the
substantially
advanced
legitimate
government
purpose
aspect
of
this
case
i
would
like
to
briefly
address
another
point
which
the
ninth
circuit
addressed
and
that
is
that
the
ninth
circuit,
without
any
prompting
by
the
parties,
brought
this
court's
decisions
in
nollan
and
dolan
into
this
case
and
said
that
the
overall
denial
of
the
plan
in
this
case
had
to
be
assessed
under
the
rough
proportionality
formulation
that
this
court
announced
in
the
dolan
case.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
i...
but...
that
seemed
to
be
an
important
aspect
to
the
court
of
appeals
affirmance
of
the
judgment.
on
page
16
and
page
20
of
the
appendix
to
the
petition
the
court
relies
upon
the
rough
proportionality
standard
as
the
basis
for
finding
that
the
jury
could
have
found
that
there
was
no
sufficient
evidence
to
support
the
city
council's
verdict,
and
it
may
be
sufficient
for
this
court
simply
to
vacate
the
judgment
and
eliminate
that
discussion
from
the
ninth
circuit's
decision.
but
we
do
want
to
make
clear
our
position
on
that
question,
that
this
court's
decisions
in
nollan
and
dolan
imposed
that
special
rule
for
a
special
situation,
where
the
concern
was
that
the
city
might
actually
be
extorting
a
right
of
physical
access,
essentially
an
interest
in
property
on
the
land,
and
using
the
occasion
of
a
permit
approval
in
order
to
extort
that.
it
was
a
special
rule
for
that
situation.
in
fact,
in
the
dolan
case
the
court
specifically
distinguished
that
situation
from
one
in
which
the...
you
simply
had
regulations
that
controlled
the
landowner's
use
of
her
own
property
as
opposed
to
having
someone
come
onto
the
property.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
the
question
then
would
be
whether
the
court
of
appeals
was
correct
in
affirming
the
judgment
on
the
ground
that
there
was
sufficient
evidence
from
which
the
jury
could
have
concluded
that
there
was
not
a
reasonable
basis
for
the
action
in
this
case,
and
that
really
goes
to
the
substantial
relationship
prong,
and
we
have...
we
have
two
basic
problems
with
that.
one
is,
we
believe
that
the
court's
formulation
of
that
aspect
of
finding
a
compensable
taking
in
agins
was
erroneous,
and
that
the
question
of
whether
a
land
use
regulation
substantially
advances
a
legitimate
governmental
purpose
should
not
be--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--it
was
not,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
i
understand
that.
the
reason
that
i
do
think
it's
relevant
to
the
court's
consideration,
however,
is
the
court
is
being
asked
to
lay
down
a
rule
for
the
lower
courts
in
terms
of
how
a
jury
or...
if
it's
a
jury
issue,
or
how
a
trial
court
should
address
that
question.
specifically,
the
petitioner
is
arguing,
and
we
think
quite
correctly,
that
if
this
is
a
proper
standard
in
a
takings
analysis.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
no--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--my
point
was
that
in
order
to
decide
the
question
of
whether
deference
to
the
agency
is
appropriate
and
whether
the
question
should
be
whether
there
was
sufficient
evidence
before
the
city
council
from
which
it
could
conclude
that
there
was
a
rational
basis
for
this
action,
there
is
the
antecedent
question
as
to
whether
that
is
a
proper
inquiry
at
all,
and
we
think
that
where
you
have
an
antecedent
question
upon
which
the
standard
of
review
depends--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--it
would
be
proper
for
the
court--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--we
believe
that
it
is
irrelevant
to
the
question
of
whether
a
compensable
taking
has
occurred.
that's
quite...
that
is
a--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--no,
but
if...
if
you
look
at
agins,
what
the
court
recited
for
that
proposition
was
this
court's
decision
in
nectow,
which
was
a
due
process
case,
and
what
the
court
said
there
was
that
the
action
did
not
substantially
advance
a
legitimate
governmental
purpose
because
it
was
arbitrary
and
irrational.
it
was
language
that
spoke
in
due
process
terms.
and
i
think
this
goes
to
justice
kennedy's
point,
too,
in
focusing
on
the
reasonableness
of
the
past
history
of
the
consideration
of
this
project
proposal.
that
is
essentially
an
objection
i
think
that
sounds
in
procedural
due
process
terms.
unreasonable
delay,
and
that
sort
of
thing,
are
procedural
due
process
or,
in
the
first
instance
governed
by
state
apa
standards,
or--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--i
think
not.
the
purpose
of
the
just
compensation
clause
is
to
address
the
situation
where
the
government
has
taken
lawful
action,
but
lawful
action
that
benefits
the
entire
community
in
a
way
that
it's
unfair
to
visit
that
cost
of
a
lawful
action
on
a
particular
individual.
bad
faith,
arbitrary
action,
those
are
not
aspects
of
lawful
governmental
action.
those
are
aspects
of
unlawful
governmental
action,
and
as
this
court
said
way
back
in
the
pennsylvania
coal
company
case
the
basis
for
the
award
of
compensation
under
the
fifth
amendment
presupposes
that
the
action
is
being
taken
for
a
public
purpose.
it
presupposes
lawful,
proper
governmental
action.
it
is
a
question
of
who
must
pay
for
it.
and
we
think
this
is
reinforced
by
the
structure
of
the
fifth
amendment,
which
separately
addresses
the
question
of
the
propriety
of
the
governmental
purpose.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
it
would...
the
way
the
jury
was
instructed
here,
either
that
the
property--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--the
court
has
said
if
there
was
all
economic...
that
is
the
test.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
the
court
has
not
really
spelled
out
what
the
standards
are,
but
it
has
typically
come
up
in
terms
of
saying
that
the
property
has
been
deprived
of
all
economic...
all
economically
beneficial--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--pardon?
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
first
of
all
we
think
if
you
focus
on
the
deprivation
of
all
economic
value
in
this
case
that
would
simply
be
impossible
to
find,
because
the...
as
petitioner's
counsel
pointed
out,
the
respondent's
own
expert
said
this
land
was
worth
$3
million
after
the
permit
was
denied.
that's
$80,000
an
acre.
so
it
would
be
i
think
impossible
to
say
that
this
land
was
deprived
of
all
economic
value,
and
therefore
we
think
it
would
be
inconsistent
with
the
purposes
of
the
just
compensation
clause,
where
you
don't
have
anything
approaching
the
sort
of
physical
appropriation--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--i...
i--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--as
you've
said,
an
essentially
unfair
procedure.
that
objection
sounds
in
due
process
objections
precisely--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--a
temporary
taking
occurs,
as
i
understand
this
court's
decision
in
first
english,
not
from
unlawful
governmental
conduct,
unlawful
procedure,
but
where
there's
a
substantive
limitation
on
development
that
is
imposed
for
a
temporary
period
of
time.
again,
the
purpose
of
the
just
compensation
clause
was
not
to
protect
the
people
against
arbitrary
or
unlawful
action.
it
presupposes
lawful
action.
and
in
the
land
use
area
there
are
both
questions
of
procedure
and
questions
of
substance.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
i
believe
it
was
not
properly
a
temporary...
i
mean,
it
was
tried
on
alternative
theories,
and
one
theory
being
that
the
property
was
deprived
of
all
economic
value,
but
that
simply
can't
be,
given
respondent's
own
expert
saying
it
was
worth
$3
million.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
the
premise
of
the
temporary
taking
award,
it
began
after
the
period
in
which
the
buyer
purchased--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--purchased
the
property.
