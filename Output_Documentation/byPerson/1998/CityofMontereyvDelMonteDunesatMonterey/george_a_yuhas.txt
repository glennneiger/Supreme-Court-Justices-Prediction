mr.
george
a.
yuhas
yes.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court--
we
are
asking
this
court
to
decide
three
issues
in
this
inverse
condemnation
case.
first
and
most
important
the
constitutional
standard
for
review
of
a
city's
land
use
decision
does
not
allow
the
imposition
of
takings
liability
based
upon
a
de
novo
second
guessing
of
the
city's
policy
and
factual
determinations.
second,
courts,
not
juries,
are
the
appropriate
decisionmakers
for
all
inverse
condemnation
liability
issues
and,
finally,
the
concept
of
rough
proportionality
does
not
apply
to
this
case,
where
the
city
denied
the
proposed
development.
what
ties
these
issues
together
are
the
concepts
of
deference
and
the
concepts
of
the
limited
role
of
the
constitution
and
the
federal
courts
in
the
local
land
use
planning
process.
this
case
is
not
atypical
in
some
respects.
the
city
was
faced
with
a
complex
decision
it
had
to
reconcile
competing
interests,
sift
through
facts,
and
exercise
its
discretion
and
judgment,
and
it
did
so.
mr.
george
a.
yuhas
it
did
so,
your
honor.
it
was
a
complicated
project.
in
this
particular
case
it
only
exercised
discretion
once,
that
is
directly
relevant,
and
that
is,
its
consideration
of
the
restoration
plan
presented
by
the
respondents.
mr.
george
a.
yuhas
the
initial
rejections
were
for
density,
and
the
fifth
one
was
rejected
down
for
two
reasons
only.
there
was
access,
and
there
was
the
restoration
plan,
and
that
was
the
first
time
that...
in
fact,
the
city
council
had
faced
the
question
as
to
whether
there
was
an
adequate
recommended
plan.
mr.
george
a.
yuhas
it
is
typical
in
this
kind
of
complex.
it
was
a
complicated
project.
mr.
george
a.
yuhas
i
submit
that
the
issue
is
not
the
reasonableness
of
the
city's
action,
but
rather
the
issue
is
whether,
in
fact,
the
city's
action
in
the
first
instance
bears
a
reasonable
relationship
to
a
legitimate
goal.
mr.
george
a.
yuhas
i
believe
that
that
is
two
different
questions.
mr.
george
a.
yuhas
i
submit
that
the
question
presented
to
the
jury
in
the
instructions
was,
does
the
city's
action
bear
a
reasonable
relationship
to
a
legitimate
goal.
here--
mr.
george
a.
yuhas
--and
we
didn't
argue
that
the
jury
could
not
consider
that
past
history,
but
on
the
specific
issue
that
the
jury
was
asked
to
address,
over
our
objection,
because
we
continue
to
believe
that
that
is
an
issue
for
the
court,
on
the
first
prong,
the
substantially
advance
a
legitimate
public
interest,
that
prong,
which
derives
essentially
from
substantive
due
proc
language,
that
is
a
deferential
test.
mr.
george
a.
yuhas
i'm
not
suggesting
that,
your
honor.
mr.
george
a.
yuhas
the
first
time
that
the
city
was
presented
with
this
development
application
was
1983.
the
final
consideration
was
1986.
there
was
some
additional
planning
for
1983,
because
the
local
coastal
plan
was
being
implemented
or
developed
at
that
time.
mr.
george
a.
yuhas
after
1986,
the
testimony
is
that
the
developer
made
no
further
effort
to
develop
the
property
or
contact
the
city.
the
property
was
sold
in
1991
for
$4.5
million,
approximately
$800,000
more
than
the
developer
paid,
and
something
less
than--
mr.
george
a.
yuhas
--well,
one
hopes.
believe
it
not,
the
lawsuit
began
in
1986.
in
1986
the
lawsuit
was
filed,
there
was
a
ripeness
challenge,
that
went
up
to
the
ninth
circuit,
it
was
reversed,
it
came
back,
and
that
resulted
in
the
trial
that
brings
it
to
today.
mr.
george
a.
yuhas
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
george
a.
yuhas
that
is
also
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
george
a.
yuhas
your
honor,
i
certainly
submit
that
the
issue
of
the
jury
trial
is
very
significant
to
my
client
in
this
case.
it
is
not...
it
does
not
have,
i
think,
great
significance
directly
in
cases
litigated
in
the
state
courts.
mr.
george
a.
yuhas
there
are
two
issues
that
were
raised,
one
which
was
raised
by
the
amicus
filed
on
behalf
of
some
of
the
states
is
there
might
be,
under
some
circumstances,
a
question
as
to
whether,
in
fact,
the
state
determination
would
be
fully
collaterally
estoppeled
in
a
subsequent
case,
or
whether
it
would
give
rise
to
collateral
litigation.
but
i
think
of
more
importance
is
that,
depending
upon
the
nature
and
the
reason
why
it's
determined
that
there
is
a
right
to
jury
trial,
the
character
of
the
issue
is
important.
if,
in
fact,
the
issue
is
one
that
requires
a
deferential
standard,
because
one
that
is
akin
to
substantive
due
process,
that
is
an
issue
that
cuts
across
simply
the
procedural
issue
as
to
who
decides,
and
goes
to
what
standard
should
be
used.
the
ninth
circuit
standard,
the
reasonableness
standard,
is
one
that
says,
when
a
government
agency
makes
a
decision...
it
could
be
establishing
seismic
standards.
it
could
be
anything,
and
all
a
developer,
a
property
owner
needs
to
do,
is
to
say,
you
know,
we
have
an
expert,
and
our
expert
says
that
we
can
build
safely,
we
can
essentially
dispute
the
fact
that
you
need
these
standards,
or
we
can
say
that
those
standards
are
excessive.
mr.
george
a.
yuhas
i
believe--
mr.
george
a.
yuhas
--yes,
that
is
what
agins
says.
that's
what
the
jury
was
instructed
here.
mr.
george
a.
yuhas
we
don't
know
that,
your
honor.
mr.
george
a.
yuhas
they
gave
a
general
verdict.
they
found
on
one
or
the
other,
or
both.
mr.
george
a.
yuhas
or.
mr.
george
a.
yuhas
either
one.
either
one,
and
that--
mr.
george
a.
yuhas
--it
was
a
general
verdict
on
that
claim.
mr.
george
a.
yuhas
that's
correct,
and
i
believe
the
ninth
circuit
in
fact
indicated
that
in
its
opinion.
mr.
george
a.
yuhas
those
are
certainly
ad
hoc
factual
inquiries.
mr.
george
a.
yuhas
however,
they
are
not
inquiries
that
i
believe
are
properly
decided
by
the
jury,
because
the
decision
of
economically
viable
use
is
not
simply
a
question
of
valuation.
that
is
certainly
a
component,
but
going
with
that
is
the
question
of
what
is
the
reasonable
investment
back
expectations
of
the
property?
mr.
george
a.
yuhas
juries
are
very
adept
at
resolving
historical
issues
of
fact.
juries
are
not
adept
at
employing
balancing
tests
or
multifactor
analysis.
mr.
george
a.
yuhas
mr.
chief
justice
that
is
absolutely
correct,
and
if
the
only
issue
on
a
denial
of
all
economically
viable
use
was
a
valuation
question,
i
would
say
the
jury
had
the
competence,
but
it
goes
far
beyond
that.
for
example,
even
where
it
does
deprive
the
property
of
all
economically
viable
use,
there
is
also
the
issue
of
simply,
is
the
intended
use
akin
to
a
nuisance,
the
lucas
issue.
that
is
an
issue
which
is
akin
to
a
public
nuisance
determination,
which
is
historically
made
by
courts.
mr.
george
a.
yuhas
juries
do
decide
reasonable
questions.
they
decide
reasonable
conduct
because
that
is
underlying
the
legal
standard
of
liability.
where
the
standard
of
liability,
i
submit,
is,
in
fact,
one,
does
an
action
substantially
advance
the
public
purpose,
and
where
that
standard
derives
from
substantive
due
process
principles
which
carries
with
it
a
level
of
deference,
carries
with
it
the
idea
that
we
don't
want
juries
coming
in
in
every
case
and
saying,
i
don't
think
that
the
state's
action
reasonably
implemented
zoning,
that
will
depend
upon
invariably
complicated
facts
and
subsidiary
policy
decisions
as
well.
mr.
george
a.
yuhas
that
question
did
not
go
to
the
jury.
in
fact--
mr.
george
a.
yuhas
--oh--
mr.
george
a.
yuhas
--in
a
proper
case,
that
question
could
go
to
the
jury.
in
this
case,
the
jury
was
instructed
that
they
were
to
disregard
motive,
because
there
was
no
evidence
of
bad
faith
and,
in
fact,
the
trial
court,
considering
this
same
record,
concluded
that
the
city
acted
reasonably.
they
were
not
attempting
to
forestall
all
reasonable
development.
mr.
george
a.
yuhas
the
taking
damages
went
all
the
way
to
trial.
they
went
4
years
beyond
when
they
actually
sold
the
property,
but--
mr.
george
a.
yuhas
--it
is,
your
honor.
mr.
george
a.
yuhas
i
believe
there
is,
your
honor.
mr.
george
a.
yuhas
first,
in
this
case
the
evidence
was
undisputed
and,
in
fact,
the
jury
was
instructed
that
if
they
found
an
insubstantial
value--
mr.
george
a.
yuhas
--oh,
very
much
so.
mr.
george
a.
yuhas
in
fact,
the
plaintiff's
expert
opined
that
immediately
after
the
city's
action
the
property
retained
$2.9
million
in
value,
and
he
opined
that
that
value
from
that
point
in
time
went
up,
so
that
when
the
property
was
sold
to
the
state
in
its
regulated
state
it
was
worth
$4.5
million.
now,
that
was,
to
be
fair,
according
to
that
expert,
a
diminution
value.
in
fact,
the
diminution
i
believe
was
in
the
ball
park
of
about
50...
about
55
percent,
but,
in
fact,
there
was
substantial
value
the
entire
time
and
that's
why,
when
the
jury
was
instructed,
if
this
property
has
substantial
value,
you
should
conclude
that
there
has
been
no
denial
of
economically
viable
use.
mr.
george
a.
yuhas
oh,
i
believe
so.
i
mean,
this
project
was
turned
down
for
two
reasons,
and
two
reasons
only.
mr.
george
a.
yuhas
and
all
that
had
to
be
done
was
to
resubmit
the
site
plan
that
had
a
better
restoration
plan,
or,
in
fact,
buy
the
property
needed
for
the
access.
mr.
george
a.
yuhas
the
very
first
time
that
the
restoration
plan
was
ever
even
put
together
in
draft
form
was
in
1984,
shortly
before
the
city
council
overruled
the
planning
commission
and
approved
conditionally
the
190
unit
development,
and
the
conditions
were,
you
need
to
show
that
you
can
do
this
development
consistent
with
habitat
protection
and,
in
fact,
they
went
through
a
year's
process.
the
city
council
expressly
said,
we
can't
assess
the
adequacy
of
this
habitat
plan
because
we
don't
know
enough.
you
need
to
talk
to
fish
&
wildlife
and
fish
&
game.
finally,
in
1986,
they
for
the
first
time
said,
we
have
the
information,
you
have
not
shown
us
this
is
good
enough.
mr.
george
a.
yuhas
i
submit,
justice
scalia,
that
that
inquiry
does
not
occur
in
the
first
prong
of
agins
as
to
whether
the
decision
substantially
advances
illegitimate
use.
that
comes
into
the
second
prong
as
to
whether,
in
fact,
there
are
economically
viable
uses
available.
if,
in
fact,
the
evidence
demonstrates
the
city
intended
never
to
approve
any
development,
the
trier
of
fact
could
conclude,
well,
i
guess
this
thing
doesn't
have
any
economically
viable
use,
and
presumably
it
would
have
no
value.
but
on
the
first
prong,
the
first
prong
simply
says,
is
there,
in
fact,
the
city's
action
denying
this
development,
leaving
the
property
as
it
is,
does
that
have
a
substantial
relationship
to
a
legitimate
goal,
whether
that
goal
be
open
space,
whether
that
goal
be
habitat
protection.
mr.
george
a.
yuhas
again,
i
submit
that
the
element
of
bad
faith
goes
into
whether
in
fact
the
property
has
been
deprived
of
all
economically
viable
use.
mr.
george
a.
yuhas
not
under
the
fifth
amendment.
there
may
be
a
remedy
under
state
law
and
if,
in
fact,
the
city
participates
in
an
effort
to
deliberately
deflate
the
value
of
the
property
for
purposes
of
condemnation
there's
a
remedy
for
oppressive
and
unreasonable
precondemnation
conduct,
certainly
under
state
law.
mr.
george
a.
yuhas
because,
looking
at
the...
what
the
jury
was
instructed
in
this
case
as
to
a
valid
purpose,
which
was
habitat
protection,
health
and
safety,
the
denial
of
this
development,
you
know,
did
unquestionably
have
a
relationship--
mr.
george
a.
yuhas
--no.
in
this
case
there
was
no
finding
of
that.
the
court
was...
directed
the
jury
to
disregard
questions
of
motive
and
certainly
i
understand
that
the
respondent
felt
that
in
fact
they
were
being
jerked
around.
the
respondent
acquired
this
property
and
only
pursued
two
applications.
the
one
that
got
approved...
i
correct
myself,
one
application.
the
only
application
that
this
respondent
pursued
was
the
one
in
1986.
mr.
george
a.
yuhas
they
bought
the
property--
