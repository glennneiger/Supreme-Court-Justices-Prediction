ms.

private...
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
private
casino
gambling
operations
are
illegal
in
38
states.
congress
supports
the
policy
of
those
states
by
prohibiting
the
casinos
that
operate
legally
in
the
other
12
states
from
using
radio
and
tv
commercials
to
reach
into
the
homes
of
people
in
all
50
states.
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
i'm
not
sure
whether
the
dispute
is
about
the
facts
or
about
the
way
of
characterizing
those
facts.
the
fcc
and
the
statute
prohibit
broadcast
advertising
of
gambling
activities.
when
casinos
operate
also
as
they
claim
to
do,
when
institutions
operate
as
hotels
and
restaurants
and
nightclubs,
the
fcc
has
reasonably
taken
the
position
that
their
advertising
of
those
activities
is
not
covered
by
the
ban.
now,
there
are
cases
that
are
close
to
the
line,
because
an
enterprise
that
runs
many
different
sorts
of
activities
and
is
prohibited
from
advertising
its
gambling
activities
may
well
try,
through
its
advertising
of
other
activities,
to
promote--
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
--well,
it
can't
actually
advertise
that
it's
a
casino,
although
it
can
avoid
that
problem
by
putting
the
word
casino
into
its
name.
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
which
many
of
them
do,
yes.
the
fcc
has
attempted
to
draw
a
line
between
the
advertising
of
nongambling
activities
and
gambling
activities,
and
that's
the
way
the
line
has
been
drawn.
if
the
word
casino
is
used
in
connection
with
too
many
of
these,
you
know,
you
have
a
good
chance...
too
many
words
connoting
chance
and
luck
activities,
the
fcc
has
said
that
in
fact
constitutes
an
advertisement
for
casino
gambling,
but
of
course,
there
are
anomalies
close
to
the
line.
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
well,
i
think
this
is
quite
unlike
the
liquormart
and
coors
problem,
which
is
i
think
the
analogy
that
you
are
drawing,
when
advertising
is
generally
allowed
and
particular
items
are
taken
out
in
order...
and
the
result
is
to
make
the
market
in
advertising
less
accurate,
or
less
honest.
this
is
a
situation
where
what
congress
and
the
fcc
has
tried
to
do
is
eliminate
the
broadcast
advertising
market
in
gambling
activities
altogether,
and
the
problem
that
we're
talking
about
arises
because
enterprises
engage
in
other
activities
as
well
and
seek
to
market
those
activities,
and
seek
to
smuggle
in
their
advertising
of
casino
gambling.
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
the
anomaly
only
arises,
as
i
said,
because
there
is
the
ability
to
connote,
to
evade
the
prohibition
on
advertising,
the
existence
of
the
gambling
enterprise.
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
that
would
be
an
even
more
effective
way
of
serving
the
government's
interest.
it
cannot
advertise
that
it
has
slot
machines,
games
of
chance.
it
can
attempt
to
connote
that,
and
that's
what
creates
the
problem
you're
discussing.
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
no.
it
is
principally
a
decision
by
congress
to...
congress
identified
a
particular
problem,
the
problem
of
private
casino
gambling,
which
is
partly
a
federal
interest
because
the
states
have
independently,
38
of
the
states
have
identified
that
as
a
form
of
gambling.
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
a
more
important
distinction,
justice
souter,
is
that
the--
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
--i
don't
know
that
there's
any
evidence
about
the
different
incidence
of
compulsive
gambling
at
the
different
casinos.
congress
chose
to
promote
indian
casinos.
it
was
a...
it's
a
controversial
policy.
it
was
a
decision
to
try
and
promote
the
economic
development
of
indian
tribes,
which
had
been...
which
is
and
has
been
quite
an
intractable
problem.
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
no,
it
is
not
fair
to
assume
that
most
of
them...
it's
very
variable.
the
12--
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
--it's
not
so
to
the
best
of
my...
it's
not
so
in
new
jersey,
indiana,
illinois,
missouri--
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
--a
large
number
of
states
have
indian
gambling.
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
21.
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
there
is
also
with
respect
to
indians
not
just
that
they
are
a
worthy
recipient
of
economic...
of
charity,
but...
or
of
economic
development,
but
that
they
are...
they
have
a
special
relationship
to
the
federal
government,
like
the
states
themselves--
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
--as
sovereigns,
whose
choices
are...
yes.
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
well,
it's
not
the
only
justification,
justice
breyer.
in
fact,
private
casino
gambling,
we've
been
talking
about
numbers
here,
it
represents
40
percent
of
the
total
gambling
market.
it
represents
more
than
70
percent
of
the
casino
gambling
market.
that
is
to
say,
the
indian
tribe
gambling
is,
and
the
charitable
gambling,
and
the
state
gambling,
is
a
very
small
part
of
the
market,
and
congress--
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
--well,
that
would
be
one
of
the
things
he's
arguing
here,
and
i
wouldn't
want
to
assent
to
that
proposition
as
a
general
matter.
the
distinction
that's
being
drawn
here,
though,
is
between
governmental
entities
on
the
one
hand
and
private
enterprise
on
the
other.
congress
has
decided
to
permit
indian
tribes,
which
are
sovereigns
and
which
are
in
need
of
economic
development
both,
to
engage
in
an
activity
which
it
has
otherwise
chosen
to
discourage
both--
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
--well,
there
would
be
a...
i'm
not
sure
that
it
would.
you're
now
interjecting
a
ban
on
all
advertising--
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
--and
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
this
is
a
limited
prohibition.
it
doesn't
prohibit
all
advertising.
it
prohibits
the
most
intrusive
kind.
it
prohibits
radio
and
tv
advertising,
and
that
is
narrowly
tailored
to
these
interests,
to
the
interests
of
the
state--
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
--no.
related
statutes
here
prohibit
interstate
transportation
and
mailing
of
advertisements.
what's
left
open
to
the
private
casinos
is
to
advertise
by
billboards
and
handbills
and
circulars
and
local
newspaper
supplements
and
matters
that
don't
travel--
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
--no.
it's
the
case
that
most
of
them
are.
well,
i'm
not
sure
of
the
answer
to
that.
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
yes,
but
i
would
like
to--
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
--there
is
no
indian
gambling
in
new
jersey,
if
that
was--
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
--i
think
it
would
be
surprising
if
congress
could
not
decide
to
promote
a
limited
amount
of
casino
gambling
for
the
benefit
of
indian
tribes,
and
that
decision
barred
it
from
otherwise
pursuing
its
two
substantial
state
interests
here,
that
is
to
say,
furthering
the
policies
of
those
states,
and
there
are
numerous
states
that
have
no
indian
gambling
and
no
private
casino
gambling.
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
well,
there's
an
interesting...
the
hole
in
the
middle
of
the
donut
can
be
found
in
the
legislative
history.
what
happened
in
1988
was
that
congress
was
told
that
private...
that
charities
and
local
fire
departments
who
wanted
to
hold
raffles,
and
car
dealers
and
travel
agencies
who
wanted
to
hold
the
occasional
raffle,
were
being
hurt
by
their
inability
to
use
local
radio
and
tv.
the
first
bill
to
solve
that
problem
was
to
lift
the
ban
on
broadcast
advertising
for
all
lawful
gambling,
the
house
refused
to
pass
that
bill,
and
what
it
did
was,
it
added
an
amendment
expressly
prohibiting
broadcast
advertising
by
private
casinos,
and
it
defined
them
as
the
profit
businesses
that
engage
in
roulette,
black
jack,
it
listed
slot
machines
and
so
forth.
that's
the
definition
that
congress...
that
the
house
chose.
it
went
to
the
senate,
and
the
senate
flipped
the
statute
to
have
hat
everyone
agrees
is
the
same
effect,
but
instead
of
having
just
a
ban
for
private
casinos,
what
it
has
is
a
general
ban
and
a
list
of
exceptions
for
everything
except
private
casinos,
but
it's
understood
by
all
here
that
has
precisely
the
same
effect,
that
in
1988
congress
did
target
private
casino
gambling
as
the
object
of
this
broadcast
ban.
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
that's
correct.
the
authority
of
the
indians
to
gamble
depends
on
a
compact.
the
obligation
to
negotiate
for
a
compact
depends
on
the
state's
permitting
some
forms
of
gambling.
however--
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
--that's
correct,
and
have
occasional
gambling
and
therefore
do
not
pose
nearly
the
same
sort
of
hazards
as
the
standing
operations
that
private
casino
gambling
is.
on
the
broadcast
advertising
point,
because
this
court
has
previously
recognized
that
broadcast,
the
broadcast
medium
poses
especial
problems--
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
--i'm
not
familiar
with
the
details.
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
what
the
indians
said--
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
--it's
not
monday
night
poker.
in
fact,
the
statute...
the
indian
gaming
statute
divides
gaming
into
three
categories,
and
it's...
the
class
3
gambling,
which
encompasses
casino
gambling,
it
also
encompasses,
though,
the
occasional
casino
night
as
well
as
the
standing
casino,
and
that's
where
this
has
it.
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
it's
slot
machines.
it's--
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
--roulette
wheels,
yes.
bingo
is
class
2
gaming.
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
that's
separately
regulated
altogether.
that's
not--
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
--that's
correct.
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
ban
on
advertising
for
the
race
tracks.
no.
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
those
activities
have
been
taken...
actually,
have
been
for
a
long
time
regarded
as
not
games
of
chance
because
there's
said
to
be
some
skill
involved
in
assessing
the--
[laughter]
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
well,
i
think
that's
an
important
distinction.
both
the
harm
to
compulsive
or
pathological
gamblers,
the
appeal
to
them,
and
the
devastating
social
costs
that
are
afflicted
are
incident
to
the
continuous
play
feature
of--
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
--that
has
been
a
problem
with
lotteries.
it
is
not...
congress
was
entitled,
as
the
states
themselves
decided
that
it
wasn't
the
same
order
of
problem
as
private
casino
gambling
with
slot
machines.
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
well,
some
justices,
some
opinions
have
said
so.
i
don't
believe
the
court
has
so
held,
and
i
would
say
that
edge
is
the
best
authority
for
the
proposition
that,
particularly
where
the
different
choices
of
different
states
are
involved
and
are
to
be
respected,
congress
is
peculiarly
unable
to
attack
the
problem
by
a
nation
wide
regulations...
it
would,
for
instance,
ban
private
casinos
or
regulate
it...
when
one
of
its
objectives
is
in
fact
to
permit
the
states,
the
minority
states
to
make
a
different
choice.
but
its
effort
is
to
protect
the
choice
of
the
38
states
that
prohibit
this
activity
as
well
as
to
pursue
its
own
overarching
concern
about
the
social
costs
of
gambling,
and
edge
did
not
require
congress
to
seek
some
other
way
of
serving
that
objective
before
passing
the
statute
that
it
passed
there,
which
is
related
to
this
one,
but
involves
different
treatment
of
state
lottery
advertising
as
distinguished
from
private
casino
gambling.
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
well,
that's
correct.
the
statute
is...
has
consistently
been
attacked
in
this
litigation
from
both
directions
on
the
ground
that
it's
too
broad
to
be
constitutional,
or
too
narrow
to
be
constitutional,
and--
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
--well,
that
involves
a
lot
of
assumptions.
i
mean,
any
attempt
to
deal
with
this
problem
involves
some
assumptions
about
human
behavior.
if
broadcast
advertising
is
intrusive,
which
seems
to
be...
and
reaches
very
widely,
if
it...
it
has
a
particular
ability
to
stimulate
demand,
to
remind
people
that
this
is
what
they
want
to
do,
to
induce
in
them
the
desire
to
do
it,
to
create,
to
help
create
the
addiction,
then
it's
a
reasonable
way
of
attacking
the
problem.
a
tv
commercial--
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
--yes.
a
tv
commercial
showing
a
slot
machine
pouring
out
money
with
lots
of
people
rejoicing
and
saying
they
don't
have
to
work
any
more
is
a
lot
more
seductive--
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
--that's
so,
yes,
and,
of
course,
broadcast
advertising,
which
has
this
broad
interstate
reach,
is
completely
beyond
the
regulatory
power
of
the
states,
so
to
the
extent
this
is
an
effort
in
cooperative
federalism,
the
federal
government
has
attacked
this
problem
where
it
has
the
unique
authority,
without
intruding
excessively
on
the
choices
of
the
states
that
have
made
a
different
choice.
there
is
no
reason
to
interpret
the
constitution
to
require
congress
to
outlaw
this
controversial
practice
altogether
rather
than
seeking
to
keep
it
off
the
airways
and
to
reduce
demand,
and
especially
to
reduce
demand
among
those
impulse
buyers
who
respond
to
broadcast
advertising.
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
well,
it
seems
to
me
the
question
should
be
no
different
from
the
question
whether
congress
could
decide
to
outlaw
private
casino
gambling
altogether
but
permit
indian
tribes
to
engage
in
it.
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
yes,
but
this
is
commercial
speech.
this
is
speech
that
is
very
close
to
an
act.
this
is
like
an
offer
to
sell
services,
and--
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
--no,
i'm
not...
i
didn't
mean
to
argue
that.
what
i
meant
to
argue
is
that
it
has
something
in
common
with.
the
reason
it
doesn't
have...
the
reason
it
has
been
treated
by
this
court
as
a
separate
category
is
that
it
partakes
of
some
of
the
qualities
of--
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
--even
if--
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
--it
may.
it
may,
but--
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
--well,
except
that
the--
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
--the
indians
i
think
stand
on
a
different
footing
of
this
discussion
from
grocery
stores
or
boy
scouts.
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
well,
it--
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
--well,
it
is
a
restriction,
a
speech
restriction
that
follows
a
conduct
restriction.
that
is
to
say,
just
as
those
states
which
conduct
lotteries
may
advertise
them,
so
may
those
indian
tribes
which
conduct
lotteries
may
advertise
them,
and
congress
was
entitled
to
distinguish
those
activities
of--
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
--yes,
that
is
the
situation
in
some
cases.
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
yes
it
does.
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
that's
correct,
and
that--
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
--that's
correct.
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
that's
right,
and
that's
why
this
is
really--
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
--a
substantive--
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
--that's
true.
[laughter]
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
well,
the
question
there
would
be
whether
that--
[laughter]
--distinction
is
permissible
or
not.
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
that's
correct.
there's
nothing
inconsistent
about
the
fact
that
congress
permits
churches,
civic
groups,
and
fire
departments
to
use
the
airwaves
to
promote
the
bingo
games
and
raffles
they
use
for
fundraising.
that
simply
doesn't
pose
the
same
kind
of
problem
that
the
standing
private
casino
poses.
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
could
the
state
do
that?
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
i
think
probably
not,
particularly
if
you're
talking
about
all
advertising,
but
if
there
were
wide
variation
among
the
states
on
this
issue
and
congress
chose
to
enforce
that
variation
through
a
ban
on
broadcast
advertising
that
left
newspapers
and
other
methods
open,
i
think
it
could
do
that.
