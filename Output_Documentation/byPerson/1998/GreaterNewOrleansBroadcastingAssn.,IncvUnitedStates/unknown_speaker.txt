unknown
speaker
make
the
assumption,
and
it's
an
assumption
i'm
sure
you
would
disagree
with,
that
congress
could
prohibit
advertising
for
casino
gambling,
that
that's
a
stable
category.
you
can
tax
based
on
casinos,
assume
it's
a
stable
category
and
you
could
pass
a
regulation
prohibiting
all
advertising
for
casino
gambling.
why
does
the
calculus
change
when
indian
casino
gambling
is
exempted?
what's
the
theoretical
and
the
jurisprudential
reason
for
your
objecting
to
the
statute
if
it
has
that
exemption
in
it?
unknown
speaker
this
is
a
hypothetical
case.
no
casino
gambling
advertising
except
for
indian.
this
is
not
that
case.
just--
unknown
speaker
--i
just
want
to
test
the
reason
for
the
exception.
unknown
speaker
but
can't
the
government
weigh
on
the
other
side
of
that
equation
the
fact
that
casino
gambling
may
be
essential
to
the
well
being
of
indian
tribes
as
a
source
of
income,
whereas
it
doesn't
have
to
weigh
that
and
say
that's
very
desirable
that
private
casino
owners
have
a
similar
source
of
income?
unknown
speaker
is
there
a
more
basic--
--not
if
you
don't
have
any
private
casinos
in
the
states
where
the
indians
are
located.
i
don't
know
what
kind
of
a
scheme
you're
envisioning.
unknown
speaker
is
there
a
more
basic
first
amendment
argument,
and
that
is
that
congress
cannot
grant
or
withhold
the
ability
to
speak
based
on
the
identity
of
the
speaker,
or
are
you
foreclosed
from
making
that
argument
because
this
is
a
commercial
speech
case?
unknown
speaker
that's
what
i
wanted
to
explore.
unknown
speaker
well,
it's
not
really
the
identity
of
the
speaker
involved
here
anyway.
they
wouldn't
allow
anybody
to
advertise
gambling
on
behalf
of
the
private
casinos,
whether
it's
the
private
casinos
themselves
or
just
some
public
interest
group
that's
interested
in
promoting
gambling.
unknown
speaker
mr.
ennis,
could...
i
didn't
mean
to
interrupt
you,
if
you're
going
on
with
him.
unknown
speaker
i've
a
question
when
you're
done.
unknown
speaker
it's
a
nuts
and
bolts
question.
would
you
explain
to
me
what
the,
just
the
legal
mechanism,
the
text,
the
regulation
that
results
in
the
scheme
that
you
described
in
the
yellow
brief
in
which
the
private
casinos
can
advertise
but
there
are
certain
subjects
they
cannot
advertise.
i
understand
they
can't
advertise
payout
ratios.
i
guess
they
can't
give
photographs
of
games
in
progress.
how
does
that
come
about?
what's
the
scheme?
unknown
speaker
it's
only
if
they
have
the
name
casino.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
so
casinos
are
okay.
games
of
chance
are
not.
unknown
speaker
if
it's
not
in
quotes,
yes.
yes.
do
you
know
just
as
a
fact,
there
are
about
36
or
37
states
that
allow
casino
gambling?
unknown
speaker
how
many?
unknown
speaker
so
do
the
12
that
allow
private,
are
there
indian
tribes
in
each
of
those,
do
you
know?
unknown
speaker
mr.
ennis,
is
casino
gaming
different
from
casino
gambling?
unknown
speaker
i
noticed
in
your
brief
you
never
used
the
word
gambling.
it
was
always
except--
[laughter]
--except
that
you
assured
us
that
this
law
would
not
reduce
compulsive
gambling.
i
gather
there
is
compulsive
gambling
and
everything
else
is
gaming,
is
that
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
why
don't
we
use
the
real
word
and
call
it
gambling.
unknown
speaker
mr.
ennis,
isn't
it
the
case
that
in...
statutes
or
regulation
they
do
use
the
word
gaming?
unknown
speaker
because
i
remember
the
first
time
i
came
across
it
in
a
regulation
i
thought,
oh,
they're
regulating
hunting.
[laughter]
i
think
congress
doesn't
really
like
to
authorize
gambling,
and
the
indian
gaming
act
has
a
much
better
ring
to
it.
unknown
speaker
mr.
ennis,
i
take
it
that
part
of
the
government's
submission
is
that
the
bulk
of
gambling
occurs
in
private
casinos
if
you
view
the
problem
nationwide,
and
that
the
exceptions
are
only
a
small
part
of
the
overall
effect
and
therefore
they
say
that
the
limited
prohibition
of
advertising
in
private
casinos
does
accordingly
address
the
bulk
of
the
problem.
unknown
speaker
right,
but
they
say
that
the
social
costs
are
really
achieved
in
the
private
sector,
and
that's
why
they
have
this
limited
thing.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
think
you
miss
the
point.
they
say
the
bulk
of
the
gambling
is
in
private
casinos,
so
we're
hitting
the
bulk
of
the
problem
by
this
ban.
they
gave
a
percentage
in
their
brief,
i
forget,
it
was...
it
was
a
surprisingly
high
percentage.
was
it
80
percent
is
in
private
casinos?
unknown
speaker
i
thought
it
was
40
percent.
unknown
speaker
well,
not
just
casino,
but
all
gambling.
unknown
speaker
which
would
include
state
lotteries
and
everything
else.
unknown
speaker
i'm
just
curious
on
that
point,
do
you
count
the,
quote,
cruises
in
the
mississippi
river
and
in
the
calumet
river
outside
chicago,
are
they...
which
are
they?
are
they
counted
or
not
in
that
study?
unknown
speaker
some
of
these
cruises,
you
know,
the
boats
never
get
2
feet
from
the
shore.
unknown
speaker
so
you
would
exclude
the
riverboats
on
the
mississippi?
unknown
speaker
i
don't
understand.
aren't
mississippi
riverboat
cruise
casinos
covered
by
this
statute?
unknown
speaker
well
then,
so
why
shouldn't
they
include
it.
i
don't--
unknown
speaker
--suppose
private
casino
gambling,
which
is
the
target
of
the
federal
regulation,
accounts
for
90
percent
of
the
gambling
in
the
united
states,
hypothetical
case.
what
would
your
argument
be
before
us?
unknown
speaker
but
if
we
have
a
40-percent
figure
that
we're
working
with
hypothetically,
it
seems
to
me
that
that's
close
enough
for
the
government's
interest
to
comply
with
edge.
unknown
speaker
well...
no,
no.
they're
lawful
where
they're
conducted.
they're
not
lawful
in
every
state
where
they're
advertised,
necessarily.
unknown
speaker
i
mean,
you
say
most
of
the
states,
what--
unknown
speaker
--yes,
but
if
38
have
it--
unknown
speaker
--but
there
are
38
states
that
haven't,
and
in
those
states
at
least
this
ban
does
indeed
ban
something
than
is
unlawful
in
those
states.
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask--
--what
happens
in
states--
--mr.
ennis,
one
question
first.
we've
been
talking
so
much
about
the
exceptions,
is
it
your
assumption
that
as
a
predicate
for
the
whole
argument
that
the
statute
would
be
constitutional
if
it
had
no
exceptions?
unknown
speaker
but
there
was
something
else
going
on
in
that
case.
i
mean,
i
think
it
had
the
smell
of
giving
existing,
maybe
mom
and
pop
stores
a
monopoly,
of
protecting
against
fair
competition
in
order
that
existing
sellers
could
have
high
prices
and
not
be
fiercely
competed
against
by
price
cutters,
and
there's
not
that
problem
here.
i
can't
think
of
any
other
reason
that
the
government
would
be
enacting
this
prohibition
except
genuinely
to
stop...
you
know,
to
stop
a
rush
to
the
gaming
tables.
unknown
speaker
what
opinion
are
you
talking
about?
unknown
speaker
what
would
you
do
if
two
states
legalized
marijuana
and
congress
prohibits
the
advertising
of
marijuana
in
any...
by
any
broadcaster
in
any
state?
unknown
speaker
who
decides
what
the
government's
interests
are?
i
mean,
is
it
up
to
the
court
to
decide
what
the
government's
interests
are,
or
can
we
take
the
word
of
the
government
as
to
what
its
interests
are,
so
long
as
they're
not
discriminatory
in
some
way?
unknown
speaker
so
if
the
government
in
its
brief
had
asserted
that
broad
an
interest,
the
case
might
come
out
differently,
it
depends
on
what
the
government
says
in
its
brief?
unknown
speaker
then
it's
the
solicitor
general
who
decides
what
the
government's
interests
are,
rather
than
congress?
unknown
speaker
well,
mr.
ennis,
the
court
has
got
to
take
the
interest
within
the
limits
that
the
government
posits
it,
but
the
court
does
not
have
to
take
the
interests
uncritically,
does
it?
for
example,
if
this
case
were
being
argued
on
the
question
of
interest
rather
than
on
prongs
three
and
four,
wouldn't
it
be
open
to
the
court
to
assess
the...
let's
say
the
realistic
character
of
the
asserted
interest
by
reference
to
the
very
exceptions
that
you're
arguing
here?
wouldn't
we,
in
other
words,
be
free
to
say,
it's
not
plausible
to
say
that
the
government's
interest
is
what
it
is
when
it
allows
all
these
exceptions
and
in
fact
go
so
far
as
to
promote
some
of
them?
unknown
speaker
okay.
unknown
speaker
mr.
ennis,
do
i
understand
that
your
argument
essentially
is,
we
can
take
as
conceded,
or
that
you
demur
to...
first
to
the
central
hudson
factors
that
your
case
rests
on
the
third
and
fourth,
and
because
you
think
you
have
a
secure
case
under
those,
you
don't
have
to
get
into
what
some
of
the
amici
urge,
that
we
depart
from
central
hudson
and
elevate
commercial
speech
to
a
higher
notch?
unknown
speaker
what
would
that
mean,
for
example,
if
we
were
to
take
that
broad
a
ground
for
advertising
of
cigarettes
and
control
of
that?
unknown
speaker
mr.
ennis,
why
is
it
that
the
government
has
to
go
all
out,
or
else
not
at
all?
i
mean,
in
liquormart,
i
frankly
couldn't
see
how
the
government's
scheme
was
going
to
do
any
good
at
all.
in
this
case,
your
argument
is
quite
different.
in
this
case,
your
argument
is,
this,
the
government
scheme
here
may
protect
only
60
percent
of
the
country
from
gambling,
casino
gambling
advertising.
it
will
certainly
protect
those
people
who
are
too
far
away
from
government
owned
casinos
and
indian
owned
casinos,
but
very
close
to
private
casinos.
unknown
speaker
and
in
new
jersey,
maybe,
so...
i
don't
know.
are
there
indian
casinos
in
new
jersey?
unknown
speaker
no,
but
i--
unknown
speaker
--i
want
you
to
have
your
time,
but
i
share
justice
scalia's...
in
your
answer
to
the
marijuana
hypothetical
you
say,
well,
the
government
has
to
do
something
else
first,
and
i
don't
understand
it.
why
can't
it
attack
advertising
first?
unknown
speaker
if
a
state
allows
prostitution
it
has
to
allow
advertising
of
houses
of
prostitution,
is
that
the
position
you're
espousing?
unknown
speaker
i
think
the
answer's
yes.
unknown
speaker
well,
make
it
the
federal
government.
unknown
speaker
make
it
the
federal
government.
unknown
speaker
it
has
to--
unknown
speaker
--i
don't
see
why--
unknown
speaker
--very
well,
mr.
ennis.
ms.
underwood,
we'll
hear
from
you.
unknown
speaker
well,
mr.
ennis
says
that's
not
so.
he
says
they
can
use
those
means,
but
there
are
just
certain
details
that
they
can't
advertise
about.
do
you
have
a
basic
dispute
about
the
facts
of
the
way
the
law
is
applied.
unknown
speaker
well,
but
it
isn't
even
trying,
is
it?
if
the
advertising
advertises
a
casino
in
las
vegas,
which
i
guess
is
legal,
there
isn't
any
mystery
about
the
fact
that's
a
gambling
casino,
is
it,
is
there?
unknown
speaker
which
most
of
them
do.
unknown
speaker
couldn't
one
argue
that
it's
somewhat
perverse
to
give
free
reign
to
the
las
vegas
casinos
to
advertise
the
fact
that
they
are
casinos,
with
the
implied
message
that
it's
gambling,
but
to
prohibit
them
from
giving
truthful
information
about
what
games
are
played,
what
the
odds
are
in
their
slot
machines
and
all
that
sort
of
stuff,
which
might
actually
be
totally
consistent
with
the
government
interest
at
stake
here?
unknown
speaker
there
is
one
analogy
with
44
liquormart
even
on
your
description.
that
is,
as
justice
stevens
pointed
out,
as
long
as
the
word
casino
is
in
the
title
of
the
establishment
that's
doing
the
advertising,
everybody
knows
that
it's
casino
activity
which
is
being
advertised,
but
one
of
the
things
that
advertiser
cannot
do,
as
i
understand
it,
is
advertise
his
payout
ratio.
he
can't
say,
you
have
better
odds,
because
the
payout
ratio
here
is
such
and
such,
than
you
do
in
the
indian
casino
up
the
road
or
across
the
state
border,
and
in
that
respect
there
is
an
analogy
to
the
price
advertising
in
liquormart.
this
is
value
advertising
which
is
prohibited.
in
liquormart
it
was
price
advertising.
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
that's
a
fact,
and
we
have
to
deal
with
it
and,
i
suppose,
if
the
government
were
going
to
be
consistent
in
its
own
theory
the
government
would
take
the
position,
the
fcc
would
have
taken
the
position
that
an
establishment
that
has
the
word
casino
in
its
name
may
not
advertise,
because
it
can't
advertise
without
advertising
casinos
and
everything
that
connotes,
but
the
government
doesn't
take
that
position.
unknown
speaker
would
you
respond
to
one
other
point
that
was
raised
by
justice
scalia,
actually,
in
the
question
that
he
put
to
mr.
ennis,
and
he
said
there's
another
feature
of
44
liquormart
that's
not
present
here,
and
that
is,
there
was
quite
clearly
there
an
advertising
ban
which
put
the
mom
and
pop
shops
and
so
on
at
a
disadvantage.
it
interfered
with
the
competition
within
the
market
for
that
kind
of
liquor.
and
isn't
something
very
much
like
that
present
here,
because
in
fact
the
way
the
scheme
works,
all
noncasino
forms
of
gambling
that
are
authorized
by
states
and
charities
can
say
what
they
want
to
say,
the
indian
casinos
which
are
promoted
by
the
government
can
apparently
say
what
they
want
to
say,
so
that
the
onus
falls
entirely
on
the
privately
owned
casinos,
and
isn't
that,
in
effect,
an
interference
with
competition
in
the
gambling
market?
unknown
speaker
why
is
the
problem
in
private
casinos
different
from
the
problem
in
indian
casinos?
i
mean,
the
only
argument
that
i
heard
in
the
government's
brief
was,
well,
the
indian
casinos
tend
to
be
off
in
the
boondocks
somewhere,
and
people
can't
get
to
them
easily,
and
so
compulsive
gamblers
don't
resort
to
them
that
well.
well,
they
may
be
out
in
the
boondocks,
but
i
don't
see
that
goes
to
the
government's
interest.
i
don't
see
why
that
suggests
that
compulsive
gambling
isn't
going
on
in
the
casinos
that
the
government
promotes
and
allows
to
advertise
as
readily
as
those
which
are
subject
to
restriction.
unknown
speaker
well,
is
that...
before
you
get
to
the
more
important
distinction,
how
about
the
one
that
i
was--
[laughter]
--attacking?
is
my
criticism
fair?
unknown
speaker
do
you
know
how
many
of
the
12
states
there
are
indian
casinos,
say,
either
in
the
state
or
near
the
state
so
it
might
attract
a
lot
of
customers?
is
it
fair
to
assume
that
most
of
them--
unknown
speaker
--well,
there
are
240
across
the
country,
or
something,
so
i've
been
assuming
that
probably
a
lot
of
these
are
in
these
states,
and
if
you
say
it's
not
so,
you'd
better--
unknown
speaker
--in
how
many
states
do
we
find
indian
gambling
casinos
today?
unknown
speaker
well,
anyway,
the
point
would
be,
i
guess--
unknown
speaker
--21.
i
mean,
this
is
sort
of...
i
mean,
suppose,
for
example,
the
government
were
to
say
marshmallows
are
bad
for
your
health,
we
don't
want
anybody
advertising
them
but
for
the
scouts.
i
mean,
the
object
there,
i
guess,
would
be
to
get
revenue
to
the
scouts.
that's
a
good
purpose.
but
i
mean,
is
because
we'd
like
money
to
go
to
the
indian
tribes
a
justification
for
stopping
them
from
advertising
what
is
a
lawful
activity
in
those
states?
i
mean,
they...
the
consumers
get
the
advertising.
the
consumers
read
all
about
it.
go
to
the
casino,
win
a
million.
unknown
speaker
but
the--
unknown
speaker
--yes,
of
course,
that's
true,
but
my
point
would
be,
is
it
a
justification
to
stop
the
advertising
of
a
lawful
activity
where
in
fact
the
people
in
the
state
will
get
the
message,
go
gamble,
so
your
only
justification
is,
you'd
like
the
money
to
go
to
a
group
that's
a
very
worthy
group.
unknown
speaker
well--
--ms.
underwood--
--but
if
we
could
just
stay
with
justice
breyer's
question
for
1
minute,
is
it
permissible
for
congress
to
favor
a
particular
interest,
a
particular
segment
of
the
population,
a
particular
group
by
its
speech
statutes?
i
mean,
of
course
congress
can
give
subventions
to
indian
tribes
in
many
ways
and
support
their
gambling.
can
it
use
speech
as
an
element
of
political
largesse?
can
it
use
speech
as
a
reward
to
one
group
and
not
to
another?
isn't
that
what
mr.
ennis
is
arguing
here
that
congress
can't
do,
or
am
i
missing
the
theory?
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask--
--i
suppose--
--on
your
distinction
between
governmental
and
private
on
these,
supposing
we
had
a
state
statute
instead
of
a
federal
statute,
and
a
state
wanted
to
prohibit
advertising
of
privately
owned
casinos
but
allow
advertising
of
its
own
casinos...
say
illinois
had
operated
such
a
casino
and
they
wouldn't
allow
advertising...
would
a
state
statute
prohibiting
all
advertising,
newspaper,
handbills
and
everything,
a
private
casino's
protecting
its
own...
be
constitutional
in
your
view?
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
but
it
allows
newspaper,
magazine
and
all
the
other
kinds
of
advertising
without
any
limitation.
is
that
not
right?
unknown
speaker
go
through
the
mails,
i
see.
ms.
underwood,
is
it
the
case
that
all
indian
casinos
are
remote?
unknown
speaker
certainly
in
my
home
state
of
arizona
the
casinos
are
right
there
in
the
largest
urban
center
of
the
state,
are
they
not?
unknown
speaker
see,
if
they
had
been
remote,
i
was
going
to
ask
you
whether
you've
noted
any
difference
in
the
class
of
customers
at
las
vegas
and
atlantic
city.
i
mean,
i
don't
know
that
buses
of
elderly
people
from--
[laughter]
--retirement
homes
travel
out
to
las
vegas,
and
they
certainly
do
to
atlantic
city,
and
that
might
have
been
a
justification,
but
if
you
think
the
indians
are
in
atlantic
city
as
well,
then
i
guess
we
can't
use
that,
can
we?
unknown
speaker
no,
but
there
is
some
in
connecticut.
[laughter]
i
mean,
don't
they
take
buses
up
to
connecticut?
i
mean,
is
it
any
further
from
northern
new
jersey
to
go
to
atlantic
city
than
it
is
to
get
on
the
bus,
and
they
go
across
long
island,
take
the
ferry,
go
to
the
big
casino
that
i
think
there's
near...
isn't
there
one
near
new
london
somewhere?
unknown
speaker
what
i...
as
i
read
the
statute,
the
statute
itself
doesn't
refer
to
casinos.
you
said
congress
was
concerned
with
casinos,
but
the
statute
doesn't
even
refer
to
casinos.
unknown
speaker
ms.
underwood,
am
i
right
in
thinking
that
if
a
state
wishes
to
ban
gambling
entirely,
then
no
indian
casino
can
be
set
up
in
that
state?
unknown
speaker
but
that
form
of
gambling
could
include
charitable
organizations
that
have
gambling
as
fundraisers.
unknown
speaker
excuse
me,
before
you
get
off
that
last
point,
don't
you
find
that
poses
sort
of
a
problem
for
congress?
i
mean,
congress
could
have
met
the
problem
it
was
concerned
with
by
simply
not
requiring
states,
in
order
to
keep
out
indian
gambling,
in
order
to,
you
know,
to
prevent
bingo
games,
but
congress
says
unless
you
go
after
bingo
games...
what
about,
you
know,
monday
night
poker?
is
that...
do
you
have
to
ban
that
too
in
order
to
keep
out
casinos?
unknown
speaker
well,
that's
pretty
extreme.
i
mean--
unknown
speaker
--if
congress
is
really
concerned
about
casino
gambling,
i
mean,
to
put
such
a
strict
limitation
on
the
states,
the
only
way
you
can
keep
it
out
of
your
state
is
to
ban
all
forms
of
games
of
chance--
unknown
speaker
--i
see.
okay.
what
else
besides
casinos
are
in
that
class
3?
unknown
speaker
but
not
bingo,
and
you're
saying
it's
just
roulette
wheels,
and--
unknown
speaker
--i
would
think
so.
how
about
race
tracks?
unknown
speaker
not
in
any
of
these
classes.
unknown
speaker
there's
no
ban
on
advertising
for
race
tracks,
is
there?
unknown
speaker
or
jai
alai,
or
dog
races?
unknown
speaker
well,
you
can
only
lose,
what,
12
times
a
night,
as
opposed--
[laughter]
as
opposed
to
roulette.
unknown
speaker
well,
of
course
they're
worse,
but
it
is
also
a
serious
problem
in
lotteries,
isn't
it?
there
are
a
lot
of
compulsive
people
who
gamble
with
the
lotteries.
unknown
speaker
mr.
ennis
argued,
i
think
it's
a
fair
characterization
of
his
argument,
that
congress
has
to
attack
the
root
of
the
problem
before
it
prohibits
speech.
if
that's
a
fair
characterization
of
his
argument,
is
there
authority
for
or
against
that
proposition
in
our
cases?
unknown
speaker
i
suppose
if
the
rule
were
expanded
to
prohibit
casinos
from
even
saying
their
name,
or
to
prohibit
casinos
from
advertising
their
entertainment...
although
i
guess
what
they
say
is,
las
vegas
type
entertainment.
that
gets
the
message
across.
but
if
it
were
expanded
that
way
to
be
more
effective,
as
mr.
ennis
would
like,
i
suppose
you'd
be
up
here
defending
against
a
different
attack,
namely
that
the
prohibition
was
overbroad,
broader
than
was
necessary
to
achieve
the
objective
that
the
government
desired.
unknown
speaker
ms.
underwood,
would
you
just
explain
the
linkage
between
the
government's
purpose,
to
get
a
handle
on
the
addictive
gambler,
and
this
prohibition,
because
do
we...
it
seemed
to
me
that
this
prohibition
is
effective
against
the
casual
gambler,
the
person
who's
going
to
be
entertained,
but
the
true
drunk
is
going
to
find
the
bottle,
and
if
the
bottle
is
there,
whether
it's
the
indian
reservation
or
whatever,
so
i
don't
see
the
connection
between
this
kind
of
prohibition
of
some
advertising
but
not
other,
and
the
addict.
unknown
speaker
so
you're
saying
luring
the
newcomer,
the
one
that
is
not
yet
addicted
but
may
be.
unknown
speaker
well,
tv
commercials
reach
a
much
broader
kind
of
audience
than
newspaper
advertisements
just
because
many
fewer
people
read
newspapers
than
watch
tv,
isn't
that
so?
unknown
speaker
senator
kennedy
suggests
that
maybe
you
cannot
favor
one
minority
group...
i'm
sorry,
justice
kennedy.
[laughter]
i
have
a
lifetime
job.
it's
a
long
time
ago.
i...
he
suggests
that
maybe
you
can't
favor
a
minority
group
by
restricting
speech,
and
that
is
in
a
way
what's
going
on
here,
exempting
them
from
a
prohibition
otherwise,
namely
the
state...
indian,
indian
casinos.
is
that
proposition
correct?
i'm
trying
to
think
of
any
other
area
where
one
minority
is
permitted
to
speak
and
others
aren't.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
don't
know
why
the
question
should
be
no
different.
i
mean,
speech
is
different.
unknown
speaker
but
your
argument
is
commercial
speech
is
not
different
from
nonspeech
commerce
clause
regulation,
and
that's...
that
clearly
is
not
so.
unknown
speaker
is
there
some
record
evidence
in
this
case
or
in
the
companion,
the
other
cases
that
would
suggest
that
if
you're
in
a
state
with
nearby
indian
casinos,
and
gambling
is
legal,
and
you're
hit
with
a
number
of
advertisements,
come
to
our
indian
casino
but
not
come
to
our
private
casino,
that
makes
some
difference
in
respect
to
compulsive
gamblers?
i
mean,
why
doesn't
indian
casino
gambling
advertising
have
precisely
the
same
effect--
unknown
speaker
--as
private
casino
advertising
in
respect
to
the
compulsive
gambler
rationale?
unknown
speaker
well,
once
it
does,
then
you're
really
back
to
the
only
justification
being
that
it's
better
to
have
the
money
go
to
the
indians
than
it
is
to
have
it
go
to
private
people,
and
that's
why
it
seems
to
me
to
the
same,
it's
better
to
have
the
money
go
to
the
boy
scouts
than
it
is
to
have
it
go
to
the
grocery
stores--
unknown
speaker
--and
that's
bothering
me.
unknown
speaker
of
course,
in
respect
to
economic
regulation
the
answer
would
be
all
the
things
you
mentioned,
but
this
is
speech
regulation,
and
it
is
at
least
have
to
be
proportionate.
unknown
speaker
so
proportionality
in
respect
to
the
restriction,
well,
is
this
a
justification
in...
on
that
kind
of
a
test?
unknown
speaker
and
of
course--
--and
maybe
that--
--aren't
some
of
the
indian
gambling
casinos
in
fact
being
operated
by
private
casino
interests
such
as
harrah's,
or
something
like
that,
that
just
pay
over
a
percentage
to
the
tribe?
isn't
that
the
situation?
unknown
speaker
but
the
money
goes
to
the
tribe.
unknown
speaker
maybe
the
answer
to
justice
kennedy's
question
is
that
a
minority
is
not
being
favored
in
allowing
them
to
say
things
which
others
cannot
say.
as
i
understand
this
law,
nobody
can
advertise
private
casinos,
right?
unknown
speaker
i'm
not
allowed
to,
indians
aren't
allowed
to,
nobody
is
allowed
to
advertise
private
casinos.
unknown
speaker
and
everybody
is
allowed
to
advertise
indian
casinos.
if
the
private
casinos
want
to
help
out
the
indians--
[laughter]
--they
can
advertise
indian
casinos,
right?
unknown
speaker
it's
a
substantive
restriction--
unknown
speaker
--rather
than
a
speech--
--and
rich
and
poor
can
sleep
under
the
bridges.
unknown
speaker
nobody
can
advertise
marshmallows.
anybody
can
advertise
boy
scout
marshmallows.
unknown
speaker
but
it's
a
question
of
whether
the
substantive
distinction
is
permissible.
it's
not
that
you're
allowing
some
people
to
say
things
which
other
people
can't
say.
unknown
speaker
let
me
ask
you
one
last
question,
if
you're...
you've
just
about
run
out
of
your
argument.
supposing
a
state
prohibits
the
sale
of
liquor
on
sundays.
could
it
prohibit
advertising
of
the
fact
that
a
neighboring
state
has
liquor
stores
open
on
sundays?
unknown
speaker
say
illinois
prohibits
the
sale
of
liquor
on
sunday,
but
indiana
does
not,
could
illinois
prohibit
indiana
advertise...
from
advertising
in
the
chicago
radio
stations
and
chicago
newspapers
that
their
stores
are
open?
unknown
speaker
thank
you,
ms.
underwood.
mr.
ennis,
you
have
3
minutes
remaining.
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
mr.
ennis,
you're
not
going
to
convince
me
that
you'd
like
the
statute
better
if
it
did
not
allow
the
use
of
the
word
casino.
unknown
speaker
would
it
be
okay?
would
it
be
constitutional
if
they
didn't
allow
them
to
use
the
word
casino--
unknown
speaker
--there's
no
way
out
of
this
box.
unknown
speaker
mr.
ennis,
how
many
states
have
government
casinos?
