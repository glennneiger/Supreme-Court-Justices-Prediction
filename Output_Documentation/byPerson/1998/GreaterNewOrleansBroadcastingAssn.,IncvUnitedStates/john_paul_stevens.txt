justice
john
paul
stevens
now
this
case
comes
to
us
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit.
a
federal
statute
enacted
in
1934
that
is
now
codified
as
section
1304
of
the
criminal
code,
as
well
as
a
federal
communications
commission
regulation,
prohibit
radio
and
television
broadcasters
from
carrying
certain
advertisements
about
gambling.
for
example,
the
ban
applies
to
advertising
for
state-run
lotteries
if
broadcast
from
a
state
without
a
lottery.
as
well
as
to
advertising
for
commercial
gambling,
commercial
casino
gambling
but
regardless
of
the
stations
or
the
casinos
vocation
unless
the
casino
is
operated
by
an
indian
tribe.
petitioners
who
represent
new
orleans
broadcasters
wish
to
run
advertisements
for
private
commercial
casinos
that
are
lawful
and
regulated
in
louisiana
and
mississippi.
they
filed
this
suit
alleging
the
section
1304
and
the
commission
regulation
violate
the
first
amendment
as
applied
to
them,
the
district
court
however
granted
the
government’s
cross-motion
for
summary
judgment
and
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed.
we
accepted
the
broadcaster’s
petition
for
certiorari
and
now
reverse.
we
hold
that
the
first
amendment
protects
petitioners
right
to
broadcast
advertisements
of
lawful
private
casino
gambling.
our
decision
in
a
case
known
as
central
hudson
set
out
a
four-part
test
for
evaluating
governmental
restrictions
and
commercial
speech.
that
test
asks
first
whether
the
speech
at
issue
concerns
lawful
activity
and
is
not
misleading,
and
second
whether
the
asserted
governmental
interest
is
substantial.
if
so
we
must
then
consider
whether
the
regulation
directly
advances
the
governmental
interest
asserted
and
finally
whether
the
regulation
is
not
more
extensive
than
is
necessary
to
serve
the
government's
articulated
interest.
although
we
have
been
asked
to
reject
that
four-part
standard
in
a
favor
of
the
more
straightforward
and
stringent
rule.
we
do
not
have
to
break
new
ground
in
this
case
because
the
state’s
speech
restriction
before
us
cannot
survive
the
central
hudson
analysis.
all
agreed
that
petitioners
proposed
broadcasts
constitute
commercial
speech
and
that
their
content
would
not
mislead
in
what
concern
lawful
activity.
we
can
also
accept
the
two
interests
asserted
by
the
government
as
substantial:
first,
reducing
a
social
cost
associated
with
casino
and
other
forms
of
gambling;
and
second
assisting
states
that
restrict
or
prohibit
casino
and
other
forms
of
gambling.
we
cannot
however
ignore
the
congress’
unwillingness
to
adopt
a
single
national
policy
that
consistently
endorses
either
interest
asserted
by
the
government.
when
section
1304
was
enacted
in
1934
it
was
part
of
a
uniform
federal
antigambling
policy
that
is
no
longer
the
case.
with
partial
or
complete
exemptions
for
advertising
about
tribal
and
state-run
casinos,
parimutuel
horse
and
dog
racing,
state
and
local
lotteries,
fishing
contest
and
high
life.
the
government's
gambling
policy
is
decidedly
equivocal
at
this
time.
in
the
judgment
of
congress
and
many
state
legislatures
the
social
cost
supporting
the
suppression
of
gambling
are
often
outset
and
sometimes
outweighed
by
countervailing
policy
considerations.
bearing
in
mind
this
ambivalence,
the
government
cannot
satisfy
the
third
and
fourth
parts
of
the
central
hudson
test.
with
regard
of
the
government’s
first
asserted
interest-alleviating
casino
gambling’s
social
cost
by
limiting
demand,
the
operation
of
section
1304
and
its
regulatory
regime
is
so
pierced
by
exemptions
and
inconsistencies
that
the
government
cannot
hope
to
exonerate
it.
federal
law
prohibits
a
broadcaster
from
carrying
advertising
about
privately
operated
commercial
casino
gambling,
regardless
of
the
station’s
or
the
casino’s
location,
but
exempts
advertising
about
state-run
casinos,
certain
occasional
commercial
casino
gambling
and
tribal
casino
gambling
even
if
the
broadcaster
is
located
in
or
broadcasts
to
a
jurisdiction
with
the
strictest
of
antigambling
policies.
moreover,
the
fcc
prohibits
references
to
"vegas-style
games"
but
permits
casinos
to
advertise
"vegas-style
excitement".
the
government
cannot
adequately
justify
the
distinctions
it
has
drawn.
for
example,
the
government
admits
that
tribal
casinos
offer
precisely
the
same
types
of
gambling
as
do
private
commercial
casinos
and
indicates
the
direct
regulation
of
such
gambling
is
effective
in
combating
the
social
ills
with
which
congress
was
concerned.
while
there
maybe
valid
reasons
for
imposing
commercial
regulations
on
non-indian
businesses
that
differ
from
those
imposed
and
tribal
enterprises,
it
does
not
follow
that
those
differences
justify
abridging
non-indians
freedom
of
speech
more
severely
than
the
freedom
of
their
tribal
competitors.
for
the
power
to
prohibit
or
to
regulate
particular
conduct
does
not
necessarily
include
the
power
to
prohibit
or
regulate
speech
about
that
conduct.
considering
the
manner
in
which
section
1304
and
its
exceptions
operate
and
the
scope
of
the
speech
proscribe,
the
government’s
second
asserted
interest
assisting
states
with
policies
that
disfavor
private
casinos
provides
no
more
convincing
basis
for
upholding
the
regulation
than
the
first.
in
sum,
respondents
cannot
overcome
the
first
amendment’s
presumption
that
the
speaker
and
the
audience,
not
the
government
are
normally
the
best
judges
of
the
value
of
accurate
and
non-misleading
information
about
the
lawful
conduct.
our
judgment
is
unanimous,
but
the
chief
justice
has
filed
a
brief
concurring
opinion
and
justice
thomas
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
the
judgment.
