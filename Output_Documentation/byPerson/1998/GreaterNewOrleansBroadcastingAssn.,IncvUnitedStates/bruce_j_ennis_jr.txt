mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
federal
scheme
at
issue
here
is
so
riddled
with
exceptions
that
it
cannot
materially
advance
the
government's
asserted
interests,
and
it
is
insufficiently
tailored,
because
those
interests
could
be
advanced
more
effectively
by
regulating
the
underlying
conduct.
the
asserted
interests
are
helping
states
that
want
to
protect
their
residents
from
exposure
to
advertising
for
gambling
activities
reducing
the
social
costs
of
gambling,
but
federal
law
now
permits
advertising
promoting
government
casinos,
indian
casinos,
race
track
and
off
track
betting
to
be
broadcast
from
within
even
states
that
have
not
authorized
those
forms
of
gambling.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
well,
first,
justice
kennedy,
this
statute
doesn't
even
prohibit
all
advertising
for
private
casinos.
it
permits
private
casinos
to
broadcast--
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
--the
reason--
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
--the
reason,
justice
kennedy,
is
that
the
government
doesn't
assert,
and
it's
certainly
not
obvious
that
there
is
any
difference
in
the
social
costs
between
gambling
at
government
and
indian
casinos
and
gambling
at
private
casinos,
particularly
when
the
federal
law
allows
the
government
and
indian
casinos
to
provide
the
same
games
operated
by
the
very
same
private
companies.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
i
think
not,
chief
justice
rehnquist,
for
two
reasons.
first,
here,
as
in
discovery,
the
fact
that
there
may
be
social
benefits
associated
with
indian
and
government
casino
gambling
has
absolutely
nothing
to
do
with
whether
the
federal
scheme
materially
advances
the
government's
interest
in
reducing
the
social
costs.
second,
even
if
there
were
such
benefits,
those
benefits
would
not
satisfy
the
central
hudson
test
under
the
fourth
prong,
because
the
very
same
benefits
could
be
obtained
by
taxing
private
casinos
and
giving
those
revenues
to
state
governments
or
indian
tribes.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
well,
justice
scalia,
if
the
private
casinos
are
not
in
those
states,
those
states
are
not
going
to
be
that
concerned
about
them,
but
if
they
are
there,
they
could
be
taxed
by
the
federal
government
and
the
proceeds
distributed,
so
the
social
benefits
argument
here,
as
in
discovery,
isn't
sufficient.
in
discovery,
the
government
made
a
very
similar
argument.
they
argued
that
it
was
okay
to
allow
distribution
of
newspapers
but
not
of
commercial
handbills
because
the
newspapers
had
greater
benefits,
greater
social
value,
and
the
court
rejected--
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
--justice
kennedy--
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
--justice
kennedy,
i
don't'
think
we're
foreclosed
from
making
that
argument
because
it's
a
commercial
speech
case,
but
i
think
this
case
can
be
decided
on
much
easier
and
more
straightforward
grounds,
the
basic
prong
three
and
prong
four
of
central
hudson.
this--
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
--that's
correct,
justice
scalia,
the
ban
is
a
ban
on
broadcasters,
not
on
the
private
casinos
themselves,
but
i
took
justice
kennedy's
question
to
be
that
effectively
they're
banning
the
private
casinos
themselves.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
well--
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
--justice
souter.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
justice
souter,
the
answer
to
that
is,
is
that
the
statute
itself
does
not
prohibit
all
broadcast
advertising
even
of
gambling
activities.
it
only
prohibits
broadcast
advertising
of,
quote,
games
of
lot
or
chance,
and
the
fcc,
the
implementing
agency
has
interpreted
that
for
more
than
12
years
as
if
the
advertising
does
not
directly
advertise
gambling
activities,
then
it's
permitted
under
this
federal
scheme.
now,
under
that
interpretation
the
fcc
has
repeatedly
ruled
that
even
private
casinos
can
broadcast
advertising
in
every
state
saying
that
they
are
a
casino,
and
that
the
odds
for
fun,
winning
a
vacation
and
vegas
style
excitement
are
high,
but
they
cannot
advertise--
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
--only
if
they
have
the
name
casino,
justice
stevens.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
but
virtually
98
percent
of
all
casinos
have
the
name
casino,
and
they
could
easily
change
their
name
to
come
within
that
requirement.
but
what
they
can't
advertise
is
advertisements
showing
or
depicting
the
actual,
specific
games
they
offer,
or
their
payout
percentages.
in
that
respect
they
are
treated
differently
from
government
and
indian
casinos,
which
can
advertise
everything.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
yes,
although
the
fcc
itself
has
acknowledged
that
even
the
word
casino
is
itself,
quote,
promotional
of
casino
games.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
no,
justice
breyer.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
there
are
about
38
states
that
allow
state
lotteries.
there
are
about
12
states
that
now
authorize
private
casino
gaming,
and
there
are...
there's
casino
gaming
authorized
by
indian
tribes
in
approximately
31
states.
i
might--
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
--i
don't
know.
there
are
indian
tribes
in
many
of
those
states
for
certain.
we
don't
know
the
exact
number,
but
there's...
the
government's
own
lodging
indicates
that
as
of
1996
there
were
240
separate
indian
gaming
facilities
in
this
country,
and
that
number
is
growing
rapidly.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
no.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
no,
justice
scalia.
there's
no
distinction
between
gaming
and
gambling.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
i'm
happy
to
use
the
real
word,
gambling.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
some
statutes
use
gaming,
and
some
use
gambling,
but
there's
no
material
distinction,
and
i'm
not
trying
to--
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
--well,
justice
scalia,
that
used
to
be
the
case,
but
today
congress
not
only
authorizes
an
enormous
amount
of
broadcast
advertising
for
gambling
activities,
but
even
requires
states
to
permit
the
gambling
itself
by
indian
tribes.
federal
law
not
only
allows
broadcast
advertising
for
indian
casinos
in
every
state,
in
most
states
it
requires
the
states
to
allow
the
underlying
indian
gambling
itself.
in
fact,
florida
is
suing
the
federal
government
right
now
because
of
that.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
justice
o'connor,
i
think
that's
not
quite
an
accurate
description
of
the
government's
position.
as
i
understand
the
government's
position,
the
government
has
not
asserted
a
general
interest
in
reducing
consumption
of
gambling
or
even
of
all
private
casino
gambling.
the
government
doesn't
care
if
the
psychologically
stable
middle
class
gambler
wants
to
spend
his
or
her
money
on
that
form
of
entertainment.
the
government's
concern
is
with
reducing
the
social
costs
of
gambling,
particularly
by
compulsive
gamblers.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
well,
justice
o'connor,
there
is
really
no
reason
to
believe,
and
no
evidence
that
compulsive
gamblers
are
more
likely
to
gamble
compulsively
in
private
casinos
than
they
are
to
gamble
compulsively
in--
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
--well,
no,
i
understand--
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
--now
i
understand
what
you're
talking
about.
the
government
cites
one
study
that
suggests
that
private
casinos
in
1996
may
have
accounted
for
40
percent
of
all
gambling
revenues,
but
if
you
look--
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
--of
all
gambling
revenues.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
that's
correct,
but
if
you
look
at
that
study...
it's
page
39
of
the
christiansen
study...
the
study
itself
makes
clear
that
casino
there
was
described
very
broadly,
not
just
the
land
based
casinos
we're
talking
about,
but
riverboat
cruises,
and
overseas
fantasy
boat
cruises,
all
sorts
of
things.
moreover,
that
same
study
shows
that
in
the
previous
year--
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
--they
are
counted.
every
conceivable
kind
of--
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
--every
conceivable
kind
that
you
could
think
of--
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
--no,
i'm
not
trying
to
exclude
them,
justice
stevens.
i'm
just
trying
to
point
out
that
that's
a
very
inclusive
definition
of
casino,
but
the
important
point
is--
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
--yes,
they
are.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
they...
i'm
not
arguing
that
they
should
include
it,
justice
scalia.
i
simply
want
to
point
out
that
same
study
shows
that
in
the
previous
year...
this
is
from
'95
to
'96...
there
was
a
3.3
percent
increase
in
all
of
that
broadly
defined
private
casino
gambling,
whereas
there
was
a
13.3
percent
increase
in
indian
casino
gambling
because
in
1988
congress
authorized
and
made
indian
casino
gambling
legal,
indians
have
now
started
to
build
and
operate
indian
casinos,
and
rapidly
indian
casino
gambling
is
taking
over
the
market.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
well,
my
argument
would
still
be
the
same.
it
wouldn't
be
as
dramatic
an
argument,
but
it
certainly
would
be
the
same,
because
this
scheme,
since
it
permits
so
much
other
stimulation
of
gambling
activity,
cannot
materially
advance
the
government's
interests.
we
have
to
look
at
what
the
scheme
permits,
not
just
the
current
empirical
reality
of
what's
happening
under
the
scheme.
second,
under
the
fourth
prong
of
central
hudson,
if
private
casino
gambling
is
such
a
problem,
the
government
can
easily
regulate
private
casino
gambling
rather
than
ban
certain
kinds
of
advertising
about
private
casino
gambling.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
your
honor,
i
think
that
edge
is
really
quite
different
in
two
important
respects.
first,
the
prohibition
on
lottery
advertising
in
edge
was
completely
consistent
with
the
quite
different
federalism
interests
that
the
government
there
asserted,
evenhandedly
supporting
both
lottery
and
antilottery
states,
and
any
ineffectiveness
of
the
restriction
was
the
result
of
geographical
happenstance,
that
the
station
happened
to
be
close
to
the
state
border,
not
of
the
conflicting
provisions
of
the
scheme
itself.
that's
not
this
case.
here,
the
government
is
not
asserting
that
kind
of
federalism
interest.
its
scheme
overrides
the
federalism
interests
of
states
and
forces
every
state
to
permit
broadcast
advertising
of
government
casinos,
indian
casinos,
and
even
promotional
advertising
of
private
casinos.
second,
edge
involved
broadcasting
of
an
activity
that
would
have
been
illegal
in
the
state
where
the
broadcast
originated,
thus
arguably
did
not
even
come
within
the
protections
of
the
commercial
speech
doctrine
to
begin
with.
that
is
not
this
case.
we're
only
talking
here
about
advertising
of
lawful
activities.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
but,
justice
scalia--
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
--12
states
have
authorized
private
casino
gambling.
it's
lawful
in
those
12
states.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
but
there
cannot
be
any
broadcast
advertising
within
those
12
states.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
on
the
second
point
of
my
distinction
of
edge,
in
those
38
states,
that's
correct.
it's
not
correct
in
the--
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
--not
at
all,
justice
stevens.
the
statute
at
issue
in
44
liquormart
did
not
have
a
great
many
exceptions,
and
it
was
found
unconstitutional
under
44...
under
the
central
hudson
test.
here's
why.
the
44
liquormart
involved
a
prohibition
of
price
advertising,
and
this
court
found...
no
member
of
this
court
thought
it
was
axiomatic
that
eliminating
a
prohibition
on
price
advertising
would
materially
reduce
the
consumption
of
alcohol.
the
government
tries
to
distinguish
44
liquormart
on
the
ground
that
case
involved
a
restriction
on
price
advertising,
not
promotional
advertising,
but
both
distinctions
are
incorrect.
this
case
does
involve
a
prohibition
on
price
advertising.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
well,
justice
scalia,
let
me
respond
by
saying
that
i
don't
know
what
was
in
the
minds
of
all
the
justices
in
44
liquormart,
but
the
opinion
does
indicated
two
problems
with
that
statute
that
are
equally
present
here.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
i'm
talking
about
the
plurality
opinion
and
the
concurring
opinion
of
justice
o'connor,
particularly
justice
o'connor's
concurring
opinion
makes
the
point,
which
the
plurality
also
makes,
that
even
if
the
restriction
in
44
liquormart
would
have
materially
advanced
the
government's
interests,
those
interests
could
be
achieved
more
effectively
by
regulating
the
underlying
conduct,
and
therefore
the
scheme
violated
the
fourth
prong
of
central
hudson.
that's
certainly
true
here.
look
at
the
possible
regulations
of
conduct.
the
government
could
regulate
private
casino
gambling
by
imposing
the
same
federal
regulations
it
now
imposes
and
considers
adequate
for
indian
casino
gaming,
or
it
could
impose
betting
limits
in
order
to
reduce
the
problem
of
compulsive
betters,
absolute
limits.
it
could
prohibit
gambling
on
credit,
which
would
address
the
compulsive
gambler
problem.
in
fact,
the
government
could
even
prohibit
private
casino
gambling
entirely.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
your
honor,
i
think
that
prohibitions
of
marijuana
and
other
things
would
have
to
be
judged
under
the
same
statutory
framework
of
the
central
hudson
test.
whether
they
would
survive
or
not
would
depend
on
precisely
what
the
government's
interests
are,
how
many
exceptions
there
are,
whether
the
government
has
tried
regulating
the
underlying
conduct
in
other
states
and
can't
effectively
do
so--
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
--chief
justice
rehnquist,
this
court's
commercial
speech
cases
make
clear
that
not
only
can
the
court
take
the
government's
word,
it
must
take
the
government's
word
precisely,
and
cannot
think
up
other
interests
that
might
be
stronger
interests.
here,
the
government
asserts
an
interest
not
in
reducing
the
gambling
itself,
even
casino
gambling,
but
in
preventing
the
social
harms
caused
by
compulsive
gambling.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
unfortunately,
chief
justice
rehnquist,
i
think
it
does
make
a
difference
in
how
different
cases
might
come
out,
depending
on
the
precise
interest
the
government
puts
forward.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
unless
congress
has
itself
specified
an
interest,
that
would
be
so.
in
coors,
this
court
said
that
the
government
litigation
counsel
can
even
posit
an
interest
that
is
completely
different
from
the
interests
that
congress
initially
posited,
but
whichever
it
is,
the
court
must
take
the
interest
as
the
government
has
posited
it.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
absolutely,
justice
souter.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
i
didn't
mean
to
suggest
this
court
can't
review
the
asserted
interest.
it
just
has
to
start
with
whatever
the
asserted
interest
is.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
well,
justice
ginsburg,
it
is
our
principal
argument
that
this
restriction
fails
prongs
three
and
four
of
the
central
hudson
test,
and
that's
so
plain
that
the
case
should
and
chould
be
decided
on
that
ground.
but
we
also
argue
that
this
would
be
an
appropriate
vehicle
to
resolve
the
issue
that's
been
a
continuing
issue
among
members
of
the
court.
in
our
view,
this
is
an
appropriate
vehicle
for
the
court
to
say
unambiguously
what
it
ruled
in
virginia
pharmacy
board,
and
that
is
that
the
first
amendment
makes
for
us
the
choice
between
paternalistic
approaches
and
opening
the
channels
of
communication
when
we're
talking
about
truthful
speech.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
well,
justice
o'connor,
under
that
approach...
excuse
me,
justice
ginsburg,
under
that
approach,
advertising
of
cigarettes
would
be
viewed
under
the
same
scheme,
which
it
basically
be
a,
this
regulation
is
presumptively
unconstitutional,
and
the
government
cannot
survive
scrutiny
unless
it
meets
something
equivalent
to
strict
scrutiny.
but
there
may
be
compelling
justifications
for
regulating
cigarette
smoking,
and
it
may
be
that
is
the
least
restrictive
way,
given
the
fact
that
the
government
has
tried
alternative
forms
of
regulating
the
underlying
conduct,
and
there
might
be
a
much
more
significant
underground
problem
by
completely
banning
cigarette
smoking,
whereas
there's
no
such
underground
problem
from
banning
private
casinos.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
justice
scalia--
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
--our
argument
is
different
from
that.
our
argument
is,
there's
no
reason
to
believe
this
scheme
protects
anyone
from
broadcast
advertising
for
private
casinos
because
in
every
state
federal
law
allows
private
casinos
to
promote
the
fact
that
they
are
casinos.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
it
can't
attack
advertising
first
when
the
basis
for
the
attack
is
not
that
the
advertising
is
false
or
misleading,
or
overreaching.
that's
what
this
court
basically
held
in
44
liquormart.
it
must
regulate
the
underlying
conduct
first,
and
that's
an
easy
thing
to
do
in
this
case.
it
might
be
harder
in
the
case
of
cigarettes.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
the
question
would
be
whether--
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
--the
question
would
be...
no,
we're
not
talking
about
the
state.
we're
talking
about
the
federal
government--
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
--and
the
federal
government's
not
authorized--
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
--the
federal
government...
the
federal
government...
if
the
federal
government
wants
to
authorize
prostitution
nation
wide--
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
--then
the
federal
government
could
not
constitutionally
restrict
advertising
for
prostitution
nation
wide.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
but
the
federal
government
is
certainly
not
going
to
take
that
position,
and
it
doesn't
need
to.
thank
you.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
i
hope
i
have
time
to
make
three
brief
points.
the
first
is
in
response
to
a
question
raised
by
justice
ginsburg,
and
that
is
that
the
word
casino
clearly
signals
to
compulsive
gamblers
and
noncompulsive
gamblers
alike
that
gambling
activity
takes
place.
this
is
remarkably
like
the
coors
case
in
which
the
federal
scheme
prohibited
the
hosting
of
alcohol
content
on
labels
but
permitted--
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
--not
that
i'd
like
it
better,
justice
stevens,
but
that--
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
--no,
for
other
reasons,
but
because--
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
--but
because
this--
[laughter]
not
under
this
scheme.
because
in
coors
the
court
said,
allowing
the
use
of
malt
liquor
signals
high
alcohol
content,
and
that
means
it
cannot
materially
advance
the
government's
interest,
that's
equally
true
with
respect
to
the
word
casino.
second,
many...
many
indian
casinos,
and
a
growing
number,
are
located
close
to
population
centers.
harrah's
operates
an
indian
casino
in
north
carolina,
the
edge
state,
which
it
advertises
is
within
a
day's
drive
of
half
the
population
of
this
country.
foxwoods,
in
connecticut,
is
within
2
hours
from
both
new
york
city
and
boston,
closer
than
atlantic
city.
there
are
at
least
22
indian
casinos
near
sacramento,
13
near
phoenix,
6
near
portland,
oregon,
and
growing
every
day.
third,
this
scheme
cannot
be
justified
on
the
basis
of
the
special
characteristics
of
broadcast
because
the
scheme
permits
broadcast
advertising
in
every
state
of
government
casinos,
indian
casinos,
and
even
private
casinos
when
they
say,
i'm
a
casino.
furthermore,
this
scheme
does
prohibit
print
advertising
that
uses
u.s.
mails,
and
congress
clearly
didn't
think
that
broadcast
was
worse
than
print,
because
violations
of
the
print
advertising
ban,
you
go
to
jail
for
2
years
for
each
offense,
violation
of
the
broadcast
ban,
you
go
to
jail
for
1
year
for
each
offense.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
four,
as
of
this
moment,
justice
scalia,
but
that's
a
very
recent
trend,
just
in
the
last
year
or
so,
and
that's
growing
as
well.
justice
scalia,
let
me
also
point
out,
your
off
track
betting,
this
scheme
permits
broadcast
advertising
not
just
for
race
track
betting
but
for
off
track
simulcast
betting,
so
that
people
can
gamble
every
day,
day
long,
and
broadcast
advertising
is
unlimited.
finally,
i
just
want
to
answer
one
question
that
was
asked,
and
that
is,
in
both
coors
and
44
liquormart
this
court
ruled
that
the
availability
of
nonspeech
regulations
meant
that
the
scheme
could
not
pass
the
central
hudson
test.
that's
this
case.
thank
you.
