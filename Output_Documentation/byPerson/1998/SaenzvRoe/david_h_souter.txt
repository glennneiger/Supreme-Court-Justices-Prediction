justice
david
h.
souter
how
are
they
minimized?
i
mean,
how
are
they
minimized
by
the
fact
that
congress
may
come
along
and
say,
go
ahead
and
vulcanize?
justice
david
h.
souter
right.
we
will...
we
will
induce...
we
will
induce
the
incentive
to
travel
for
the
sake
of
better
welfare
benefits,
and
that
in
the
past
has...
has
not
been
regarded
as
a
legitimate
governmental
purpose.
how
does
it
become
a
legitimate
governmental
purpose
simply
because
congress
has
said
it's
okay?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
but
that...
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
whether
congress
says
so
or
not.
they're
either
minimized
or
they're
not
minimized.
if
in
fact
we
believe
the
proper
analysis
of
this
case
is
that
a...
a
determining
objective
of
the
statute
is
to
eliminate
the
incentive
to
travel
for
better
welfare
benefits,
then
is
there
anything
that
congress
can
do,
in
effect,
to
take
the
poison
out
of
that...
the
constitutional
poison
out
of
that
objective?
i
would
have
thought
not,
but--
justice
david
h.
souter
--well,
they're
being
denied
whatever
the
differential
is.
i
mean,
that's...
we're
playing
with
words.
they're
going...
for
the...
for
the
1-year
period,
they're
going
to
be
denied
whatever
the...
whatever
the
differential
is.
right?
okay.
so,
they're
being
denied
those
benefits.
justice
david
h.
souter
you're
saying
they're
de
minimis?
justice
david
h.
souter
all
right.
let
me--
justice
david
h.
souter
mr.
garelis,
do
you--
justice
david
h.
souter
why
did
the
state
pick
1
year?
justice
david
h.
souter
yes.
justice
david
h.
souter
what's
the
justification
for
1
as
opposed
to
another
number?
justice
david
h.
souter
in
other
words,
it
was
as
much
as
they
thought
they
could
get
away
with.
[laughter]
justice
david
h.
souter
why?
justice
david
h.
souter
why?
i
mean,
your...
i
think
your
argument
is
because
congress
has
great
power
under
the
commerce
clause,
it
in
effect
can...
has
some
definitional
role
with
respect
to
the
right
to
travel,
and
i
don't
see
why
that
is
so.
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
the
argument
here
is
that
california
is
treating
its
own
citizens
based
upon...
in
a...
in
a
differential
fashion.
and
where
in
the
commerce
clause
or
anywhere
else
does
congress
have
the
authority
to
affect
a
state's
right
to
discriminate
among
its
own
citizens?
justice
david
h.
souter
--but
the
state
is
the
determinant
of
the
terms
of
the
program.
justice
david
h.
souter
the
state,
as
i
understand
it,
has
sole
authority
to
determine
the
term
of
its
program.
justice
david
h.
souter
congress
did
not
mandate
the
differential
is
all
i'm
getting
at.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
there's
a
national
welfare
program,
which
leaves
the
terms
of
the
program
with
any...
within
any
given
state
up
to
the
states.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
the
authorization,
if
accepted
here,
i
take
it,
is
an
authorization
by
congress
to
states
to
treat
its
citizens
in
two
different
classifications
depending
on
their
residence.
justice
david
h.
souter
yes,
but
your...
your...
when
you
say
the
right
to
migrate,
you
mean
the
right
to
obtain
citizenship,
don't
you?
