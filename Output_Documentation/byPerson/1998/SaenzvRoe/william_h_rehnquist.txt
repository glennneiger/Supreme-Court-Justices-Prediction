we'll
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
no.
98-97,
eloise
anderson
v.
brenda
roe
and
anna
doe.
mr.
garelis.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
general
waxman,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
general
waxman.
mr.
rosenbaum,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what...
what
do
you
do
with
the
tuition
cases?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
in...
in
dunn
v.
blumstein,
where
we're
talking
about
a
waiting
period
for
voting,
the
court
said
you
can't
require
a
1-year
waiting
period.
so,
why
in
the
tuition
cases
were
they
allowed
to
employ
a
1-year
waiting
period?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr....
mr.
rosenbaum,
what
if
congress
were
simply
to
take
over
the
entire
welfare
system
in
the
country...
the
states
are
no
longer
paying
anything...
and
just
leave
it
as
it
is?
the...
in
mississippi,
you
get
140;
california,
you
get
600.
and
the
california...
there's
a
prohibition
against
receipt
of
different
welfare
requirements
for
a
year.
so,
it
isn't
the
state
at
all.
it's
congress
doing
it
on
a
national
basis.
do
you
think
that
would
be
bad?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
where
do
you...
where
do
you
get
the
term
liberty
producing
element?
has
that
been
in
any
of
our
cases?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
you
can
say...
you
can
say
the
same
thing
about
fishermen
or
hunters.
it
may
be
that
out-of-state
hunters
or
fishermen
are
not
a
peculiar
source
of...
maybe
just
5
or
10
percent
of
the
hunters,
say,
in
a
particular
state
are
out-of-state.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
rosenbaum.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
case
is
submitted.
