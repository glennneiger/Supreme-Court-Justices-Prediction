justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
but
your
tax
standards
are
generally
rational
basis.
so,
it
seems
to
me
you
have
a
stronger
argument
there
to
say
we'll
collect
the
higher
tax
from
the
non-resident
because
we
don't
want
to
give
him
all
these
public
services.
you
know,
the...
the
incentive
to
move
to
the
state
is
the
lower
tax
rate.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
they
move
to
get
lower
tax
rates
all
the
time.
justice
john
paul
stevens
--how
can
you
say
that
if
there's
a
differential
in
the
cost
of
living
between
two
states.
if
$600
is
adequate
in
california
and
nothing
less
is
adequate,
how
can
$300
be
adequate?
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
it
was
adequate
in
mississippi,
it's
got
to
be
adequate
in
california?
is
that
your
position?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
but
the
state
legislature
in
california
has
made
a
judgment
that
$600
is
the
adequate
minimum
for
ever...
whatever
class
of
beneficiary
you
have,
which
is...
and
anything
less
than
that,
i
would
assume,
the...
even
though
it
may
be
adequate
in
another
state
is
not
adequate
in
california.
that's
what
the
california
judgment
is.
justice
john
paul
stevens
determined
to--
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
but
if
your
objective
is
to
save
money,
which
you
say,
why
don't
they
just
cut
them
in
half
for
everybody?
there's
obviously
some
reason
behind
setting
the
levels
they
do
set.
let...
may
i
ask
another
question
about--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--you
mentioned
the
fiscal
justification
for
it.
does
the
record
tell
us
what
percentage
of
the
california
budget
for
this
program
would
be
affected
by
a
different
result
in
this
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
without
knowing
what
it
is?
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
they...
do
they
know
what
the
cost
saving
is
for
the
program
as
a
whole.
that's
what
i'm
asking
you?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
can
you
tell
us
what
it
is?
justice
john
paul
stevens
as
a
percentage
of
the
total
budget.
justice
john
paul
stevens
of
the
total
welfare
budget
i
mean.
justice
john
paul
stevens
are
you
saying
congress
can
authorize
burdens
on
the
right
to
move
from
state
to
state?
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
you
could
tell
me
the
answer
to
that
question.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
can
it
just...
can
it
pass
something
specifically
intended
to
discourage
movement
from
one
state
to
another?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
but
you're
supposed
to
be
answering
a
question
about
where
congress
gets
the
power
to
do
all
this.
justice
john
paul
stevens
does
that
imply
that
congress
can
fence
people
out?
justice
john
paul
stevens
--let
me
ask
you
whether
you
think
the...
a
state's
purpose
of
discouraging
people
on
welfare
from
coming
to
the
state
would
be
a
legitimate
state
interest?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
that
if
this
statute
is
motivated
by
that
interest
and
no
other
interest,
it
would
flunk
the
rational
basis
test.
justice
john
paul
stevens
this
case
which
is
originally
filed
as
anderson
against
roe,
but
now
has
a
different
name
because
california
has
a
new
director
of
its
department
of
social
services,
comes
to
us
from
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit.
in
1992,
california
enacted
a
statute
that
limits
the
maximum
welfare
benefits
available
to
a
family
that
has
resided
in
california
for
less
than
12
months.
it
limits
it
to
the
amount
of
what
have
been
payable
by
the
state
from
which
the
family
had
moved.
as
an
example
to
illustrate
the
way
the
statute
works,
the
record
indicates
that
for
a
family
of
three,
california
had
a
welfare
grant
of
$641
per
month.
family
coming
from
louisiana
however
would
receive
only
$190
a
month,
and
one
coming
from
oklahoma
will
receive
$341
a
month.
the
variation
depending
on
the
state
from
which
the
family
came.
the
questions
presented
by
the
case
are
whether
the
1992
statute
was
constitutional
when
it
was
enacted,
and
if
not
whether
an
amendment
of
the
social
security
act
enacted
by
congress
in
1996
affects
that
determination.
without
reaching
the
merits
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed
a
preliminary
injunction
entered
by
the
district
courts
enjoining
implementation
of
the
statute.
we
of
course
granted
certiorari
and
we
now
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals.
what
we
have
described
as
a
constitutional
right
to
travel
actually
embraces
three
different
components.
the
right
to
enter
and
leave
another
state,
the
right
to
be
treated
as
a
welcome
visitor
while
temporary
present
in
another
state,
and
for
those
travelers
who
would
like
to
become
permanent
residents,
the
right
to
be
treated
like
other
citizens
of
that
state.
it
is
this
last
aspect
of
the
right
to
travel
that
is
clearly
implicated
by
california's
durational
residency
requirement.
it
is
understood
that
the
respondents
and
the
members
of
the
class
that
they
represent
are
citizens
of
california,
and
that
their
need
for
welfare
benefits
is
unrelated
to
the
length
of
time
they
have
resided
in
california.
the
classifications
challenged
in
this
case
are
defined
entirely
by,
first,
the
period
of
residency
in
california
and
secondly,
the
location
of
the
state
from
which
the
disfavored
class
members
have
come.
in
1969,
in
a
case
called
shapiro
against
thompson,
this
court
held
that
it
was
constitutionally
impermissible
for
a
state
to
enact
a
durational
residence
requirement
to
inhibit
the
migration
of
needy
persons
into
the
state.
california
which
spends
nearly
$3
billion
a
year
on
its
welfare
program
does
not
contend
that
the
statute
was
enacted
to
deter
people
from
coming
to
california,
rather
it
argues
that
the
statute
purpose
was
entirely
fiscal,
noting
that
it
would
save
over
$10
million
a
year
if
it
could
be
enforced.
the
state's
legitimate
interest
in
saving
money
does
not
however
provide
an
adequate
justification
for
its
decision
to
discriminate
among
equally
eligible
citizens.
the
right
of
a
newly
arrived
citizen
to
the
same
privileges
and
immunities
enjoyed
by
other
citizens
is
plainly
identified
in
the
fourteenth
amendment's
privilege
or
immunities
clause.
of
greater
importance,
the
fourteenth
amendment's
citizenship
clause
expressly
equates
citizenship
with
residents
and
does
not
tolerate
a
hierarchy
of
subclasses
of
similarly
situated
citizens
based
on
the
location
of
their
prior
residence.
the
congress
passed
a
statute
approving
durational
residency
requirements
does
not
alter
our
analysis.
this
court
has
consistently
held
that
congress
may
not
authorize
the
states
to
violate
the
fourteenth
amendment.
citizens
of
the
united
states,
whether
rich
or
poor,
have
the
right
to
choose
to
be
citizens
of
a
state
wherein
they
reside.
the
states
however
do
not
have
any
right
to
select
their
citizens.
as
justice
jackson
observed,
if
national
citizenship
means
less
than
this,
it
means
nothing.
we
therefore
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals.
the
chief
justice
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion,
which
justice
thomas
has
joined,
and
justice
thomas
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
the
chief
justice
has
joined.
