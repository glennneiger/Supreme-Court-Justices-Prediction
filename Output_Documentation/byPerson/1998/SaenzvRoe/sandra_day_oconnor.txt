justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
when...
when
you...
when
you
have
a...
an
alleged
invasion
of
the
right
to
travel,
the
right
to
move
to
another
state
freely
and
enjoy
the
benefits
there
as
a
new
resident,
we
have
applied
something
other
than
rational
basis
scrutiny
to
test
that
invasion.
and
you're
telling
us
that
we...
we
should
abandon
that--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--stricter
test.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
certainly
we
have
some
authority
from
this
court
that
durational
residence
requirements
do
affect
the
right
to
travel.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
i...
i
think
you'd
be
hard
pressed
to
tell
a
family
that
is
forced
to
live
on
welfare
that
instead
of
getting
california's,
let's
say,
$600
a
month,
it
has
to
live
on
$300
a
month
for
a
year,
that
that's
not
a
penalty.
i
mean,
this
is...
this
has
grave
consequences
for
that
family.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
just
don't
understand
how
if
it
impacts
on
the
right
to
travel...
i
don't
see
how
the
federal
government
can
do
it
any
more
than...
than
a
state.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
i'd
like
you
to
explain
that
to
us.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
you
know,
how...
how
has
the...
how
has
california
tailored
it
at
all
if
people
have
moved
to
california
for
reasons
that
have
nothing
to
do
with
welfare--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--relatives
living
there
or
health
reasons
or
whatever,
and
having
moved
there,
want
welfare
benefits?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
how
have
they
tailored
it?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
where
do
you
locate
that
right?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
in
the
privileges
and
immunities
clause
or
where?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
where
do
you
locate
the
so-called
right
to
travel?
is
it
found
in
the
privileges
and
immunities
clause
or
someplace
else?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
if
you...
if
you...
you
have
to
at
some
point
decide
what
test
or
standard
you're
going
to
apply
to
test
a
law
to
see
if
it
penalizes
the
right
to
travel.
and
i
haven't
heard
anybody
here
today
suggest
what
that
test
might
be,
and
depending
on
what
the
test
is,
we'll
learn
whether
a
particular
law
is
valid
or
invalid.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
do
you
have
a
suggestion
in
that
regard?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
i...
i
thought
we
had
said
if
there's
a
privileges
and
immunities
clause
violation,
that
we
ask
whether
the
people
alleging
they're
discriminated
against
or
a
peculiar
source
of
the
evil--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--and
whether
there's
a
substantial
relationship
of
the
remedy
to
the
evil.
now,
that's...
that's
not
what
i
would
call
ordinarily
strict
scrutiny.
it's
some
different
sort
of
a...
an
inquiry.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
or
travelers.
now,
i
suppose
in
the
case
of
out-of-state
fisher...
people
who
fish
or
hunt,
you
might
say,
yes,
they're
a
peculiar
source
of
the
evil
because
they're
taking
all
the
fish
and
game.
