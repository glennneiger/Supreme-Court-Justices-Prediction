justice
antonin
scalia
you're
saying
that
the
elimination
of
an
incentive
is
not
necessarily
a
deterrent.
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
i
understand
that.
you're...
but...
but
you're...
you're
going
to
save
money
by
the
means
of
not
providing
an
incentive
to
move,
say,
from
mississippi
to
california.
now,
if
you
were
trying
to
save
more
money
by
not
giving
them
anything
so
they
wouldn't
move
to
california,
it's
clearly
unconstitutional
under
shapiro.
so,
why
is
it
constitutional
just
because
you're
trying
to
save
a
little
less
money?
justice
antonin
scalia
so,
you...
you
acknowledge
it's
a
matter
of
degree.
justice
antonin
scalia
they
said
that...
well,
i
mean,
they
could
have
said
that
not
all
waiting
periods
are
penalties
simply
because
some
of
them
may
be
made
to
assure
that
the...
a
person
coming
into
the
state
genuinely
wishes
to
become
a
resident.
isn't
that
the
tenor
of
that
qualification?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
say
it's...
it's
judged
under
the...
under
the
same
test.
you
wouldn't
necessarily
have
to
say
that
it
passes
the
test--
justice
antonin
scalia
--the
way
this
one
does.
justice
antonin
scalia
people
generally
don't
move
to
get
a
lower
license
fee,
and
it
is
thought
that
people
do
move
to
get
higher
welfare
benefits.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
and
that...
that
one
may
well
come
out
the
other
way.
justice
antonin
scalia
--they
may
just
have
decided
that's
all
we
want
to
spend
on
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
--what's
the
absolute
figure?
i'm
interested
in
the
absolute
figure.
never
mind
the
right...
i
mean,
you
know.
a
billion
dollars
is
a
billion
dollars.
i
don't
care
what
it's
a
percentage
of.
justice
antonin
scalia
they're
free
to
travel,
and
i
assume
travel
includes
i
have
just
as
much
a
right
to
go
to
another
state
temporarily
and
enjoy
the
protections
of
that
state
temporarily
as
i
do
to
go
and
migrate
there.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
yet,
when
i
go
to
another
state,
am
i
entitled...
and
i'm
there
just
temporarily,
am
i
entitled
to
send
my
children
to
the
state
schools?
justice
antonin
scalia
why
isn't
the
right
to
travel
affected?
or
when
i
go
there,
am
i
treated
like
other
citizens
of
the
states
for
purposes
of
hunting
and
fishing,
for
example?
don't
i
have
to
pay
an
out-of-state
fishing
and
hunting
license
fee?
justice
antonin
scalia
a
nonresident,
but
exercising...
exercising
his
constitutional
right
to
travel.
justice
antonin
scalia
i...
i
don't
understand.
try
it
again.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
seems
to
me
my
right
to
travel
is
certainly
being
affected,
but
it
seems
to
me
not
significantly.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
what's
involved
is
a
state
benefit,
and
therefore
we
say
it's
okay.
justice
antonin
scalia
all
right.
tell
me
why
it's
different
then.
justice
antonin
scalia
not...
not
so
far
as
the
right
to
travel
is
concerned.
i...
i
thought
it's
the
right
to
travel
not
the
equal
protection
clause
that
we're
dealing
with.
i
agree
that
once
you're
a
citizen
of
the
state,
you
have
to
be
treated
like
other
citizens
unless
there's
a
rational
basis
for
treating
you
differently.
but
that's
not...
you're
not
arguing
before
us
the
equal
protection
rational
basis
test.
you're
arguing
that...
that
somehow
the
right
to
travel
entitles
you
to
something
more
than
a...
than
a
rational
basis
in...
in
how
you're
treated.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
i
don't
see
why
that
doesn't
apply
to
the
situation
when
i'm
traveling
without
desiring
to
establish
permanent
residence
just
as
it
applies
when
i'm
traveling
to
establish
permanent
residence.
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
glad
to
learn
that
because
i
would
like
to
be
able
to
get
louisiana
hunting
licenses
at...
at
louisiana
resident
rates.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
but
why?
justice
antonin
scalia
the
question
is
why.
if
the...
if
the
right
to
travel
is
what
you're
urging
here--
justice
antonin
scalia
--and
not
the
equal
protection
clause,
why
should
that
be?
justice
antonin
scalia
you're
just
restating
it.
you're
not
giving
me
a
reason
for
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
one,
just
like
the
other,
involves
the
constitutional
right
to
travel.
justice
antonin
scalia
wait,
wait.
let's
pursue
that.
the
concern
was
that
someone
was
coming
into
the
state
to
go
to
the
college
there
for
only
1
year--
justice
antonin
scalia
--and
then
transfer
out
to
another
college?
justice
antonin
scalia
then
what
good
does
the
1-year
residency
assure?
what
good
does
that
do--
justice
antonin
scalia
--if
it...
if
it
simply
requires
the
college
freshman
to
stay
there
until
he's
a
sophomore?
justice
antonin
scalia
students
are
characteristically
transient
after
1
year?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
i
can
understand
a...
a
6-year
residency
requirement
to
make
sure
that
somebody
doesn't
come
here
simply
to
get
the...
get
the
lower
college
tuitions
by
being
resident
in
the
college
town
while
he's
there
and
then
leave.
but
a
1-year
residency
requirement
to...
to
guarantee?
was
that
the
limit--
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
rosenbaum,
i
understand
that,
and
i
would
make
it
broader
and
our
opinions
have
made
it
broader
than
a
right
to
immigrate.
it's...
it's...
it's
a
right
of
travel.
and...
and
as
i've
explained,
i
don't
understand
why
we
treat
immigrants
differently
from
people
traveling
just
intermittently.
what
i
don't
understand
is
this:
why...
how
and
why
you
can
convert
the
right
of
travel
to
a
right
to
equal
protection.
once
the
immigrant
arrives
in
california
and
is
a
resident
of
california,
he
is
entitled
to
equal
protection
of
the
laws
with
the
other
residents,
and
all
you
would
apply
against
him
is
a
rational
basis
test.
now,
before
he
becomes
a
resident,
he
has
the
right
to
travel
there.
why
does
that
right
to
travel
there
entitle
him
to
equal
protection
of
the
laws
as
opposed
to
simply
not
the
imposition
upon
him
of
a
significant
deterrent
to
his
right
to
travel?
justice
antonin
scalia
you...
you
say
it's
not
just
a
significant
deterrent,
he...
he
is
entitled
to
be
treated
equally.
justice
antonin
scalia
now,
why?
why
is
he
entitled
to
be
treated
equally?
i
don't
see
that
that
follows
from
the
right
to
travel.
it
follows
from
the
equal
protection
clause
once
he
has
become
a
resident.
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
just
citizens?
i
mean,
i
agree
with
you
that
the
state
cannot...
cannot
deter
the
right
to
travel,
but
in
the
case
of
not...
not
migration
but
simply
traveling
in
california,
we
do
not
think
that
denying
the
traveler
every
incident
of
citizenship
amounts
to
a
deterrent
to
the
right
of
travel.
we...
we
apply
some...
you
know,
some
significance
standard.
why
is
it
not
appropriate
to
do
the
same
when
you're
dealing
not
just
with
temporary
travelers,
but
with
people
who
want
to
immigrate?
it
seems
to
me
it's
not
a
violation
of
their
right
to
travel
unless
you
place
a
significant
impediment
upon
their
ability
to
move
to
that
state.
justice
antonin
scalia
once
you're
in
the
citizen
situation,
the
right
of
travel
thing
is
behind
you
and...
and
you're
entitled
to
equal
protection
of
the
laws.
and
i'm...
i'm
fully
willing
to...
to
judge
this
case
on
that
basis,
but
if
you
judge
it
on
that
basis,
all
you
can
demand
of
the
state
is
a
rational
basis.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
take
that
much.
i'm
sorry.
[laughter]
if...
if
that's
the
test,
i
ought
to
get
in-state
rates.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
know
why
you...
why
you...
you
say
that
the
right
to
migrate
is
a
fundamental
right
and
somehow
less
fundamental
than
the
right
to
travel.
frankly,
i'm...
i'm...
i'm
much
more
interested
in
my
right
to
travel
to
california
than
my
right
to
live
there.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
why
is
that?
is
there
some
clause
of
the
constitution
that
says
you
cannot
have
that
as
a
state
purpose?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
provision
is
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
that
wasn't
the
question.
i
mean,
you...
you
say
there
is
some
special
prohibition,
that
whatever
other
motives
states
may
have
for
legislation,
they
may
not
have
the
motive
of...
of
deterring
people
from
entering
the
state
in
order
to
get
on
the
state's
welfare
rolls.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
you
say
that
independently
is
an
invalid
purpose.
