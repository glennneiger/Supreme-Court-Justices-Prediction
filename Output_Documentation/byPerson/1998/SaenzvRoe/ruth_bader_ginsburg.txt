justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but,
mr.
garelis,
i
thought
that
was
the
whole
point
of
this
line
of
cases,
that
the
newcomer,
unless
there's
a
reason
to
suspect
that
they're
going
to
take
the
benefit
and
run...
that
the
newcomer
should
be
treated
like
the
long-term
residents,
that
that
is
the
genius
of
the
united
states,
that
people
can
pick
their
states
and
states
can't
pick
their
people.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it's
making
a
distinction
between
longer-term
residents
and
the
person
who
is
a
newcomer.
and
that
runs
through
all
of
these
cases,
that
you
can't...
well,
perhaps
you
have
some
precedent
in
mind
that's
not
in
the
front
of
my
head.
but
i
don't
know
in
that
line
of
cases
that
distinguishes
new
residents
from
older
residents,
that
there
has
any...
been
any
one
other
than
the
two
where
there's
reason
to
suspect
that
the
claim
of
residence
is
not
genuine.
are
there
any
such
cases?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
i
suppose
you
could
think
of
the
maricopa
county
as
not
a
denial
of
benefits
because
they
were
given
emergency
care,
so
it
wasn't
they
couldn't
get
any
benefits.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
is
it
a
part...
does
the
same
principle
apply
at
the
other
end?
suppose
i
move
to
a
state
that
has
a
lower
state
income
tax
than
the
state
from
whence
i
came
or
a
lower
property
tax.
could
state
2,
my
state
of
new
residence,
say,
well,
for
1
year
you're
going
to
pay
the
higher
tax
that
you
paid
in
the
state
from
whence
you
came?
it
seems
to
me
that
that
would
follow,
would
it
not?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so,
i
just
want
to
know
where...
how
far
this
principle
goes.
are
you
now
saying,
yes,
you
can
treat
a
person
moving
into
your
state
as
though
that
person
still
belonged
from
the
state
from
whence
he
came
for
1
year,
whether
income
tax,
say,
unemployment
compensation,
or
is
it...
is
there
any
limit
to
this?
is
there
something
special
about
welfare
that
distinguishes
it
from
other
kinds
of
benefits?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
i
can
understand
that
in
terms
of,
say,
workers'
compensation
or
unemployment
compensation.
the
same
thing.
suppose
california
said,
we
have
higher
benefits,
but
you're
a
newcomer,
so
you
get
the
lower
benefits
till
you've
been
with
us
12
months.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i'm
giving
you
the
concrete
example
of
unemployment
compensation,
workers'
compensation.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
get
less...
you
got
less
in
your
original
state.
california
is
more
generous.
yes
or
no?
is
the
same
principle
applicable?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
how
about
a
car
registration?
let's
say
my
state
of
origin
charges
more
annually...
less...
more
annually...
right...
more
annually
to...
to
register
my
car.
can
state
2
say,
we...
we
need
money,
because
you
said
money
is
the
driving
force
here,
so
we're
going
to
charge
you
the
higher
registration
that
you
would
have
paid
in
the
state
from
whence
you
came?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it's
a
hundred
dollars.
i
have
to
pay
a
hundred
dollars
in
the
state
from
whence
i
came,
and
california
charges
$50.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
could
california
then
say,
for
1
year
you
pay
a
hundred
dollars?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
tell
me.
is
there?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
garelis,
i
thought
when
we
discussed
those
two
cases
before,
you
recognized...
perhaps
you
didn't...
that
there
is
in
both
a
genuine
suspicion
the
person
has
come
into
the
state
to
get
a
benefit
and
then
go.
in
the
welfare
situation,
that's
not
the
case.
the
likelihood
is
the
person
has
come
there
to
stay,
not
to...
there
isn't
a
suspicion
about
the
genuineness
of
the
claim
of
residence,
and
that's
what
distinguishes
starns
and...
and--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
how
about
5
years?
that
is...
well--
--could...
could
you...
this
is
1
year.
would
your
answer
be
the
same
if
it
were
for
5
years
you're
treated
like
you
were
in
the
state
from
whence
you
came?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
a
different
standard
of
review?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so,
if
you
say
5
years,
the
answer
would
be
different
than
1
year.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so,
even
under
the
rational
basis
test,
if
it
were,
say,
2
years,
that
would
be
no
good,
but
the
1
year
is
all
right.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
choice
of
law
rule.
that...
that
really
astonished
me
that
you
used
the
term,
choice
of
law.
we're
not
choosing
the
law
of
any
other
state.
it's
this
california
law.
california
has
two
sets
of
law:
one
for
newcomers,
one
for
oldcomers.
choice
of
law
refers
to
there
are
two
states
that
might
supply
the
governing
rule.
either
one,
one
could
argue,
is
appropriate.
the
form
uses
choice
of
law
principles
to
pick
between
potentially
regulating
rules,
but
the
old
state
has
no
interest,
no
claim
to
regulate
anymore.
that's
over
and
done.
these
are
two...
california
law
is
the
only
law
that's
being
chosen.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so,
the
first
state,
the
state
from
whence
the
person
came,
has
much
better
day
care
and
much
better
job
training,
but
lower
cash
benefits.
then
the
person
moves
to
state
number
2.
state
number
2
can
lower
the
benefits,
but
must
give
that
person
the
higher
training,
the
more
expensive
day
care
than
in
state
1?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
i'm
just
suggesting
that
your
rationale
about,
well,
they
have
a
commitment
to
state
number
1,
so
they
have
to
stay
with
that
benefit
package,
it's
not
much
of
a
commitment
if
you
say
that
they
can't...
as
far
as
the
good
is
concerned,
they
leave
that
behind,
but
the
bad
they
carry
over.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it's
not
in
the
congressional...
the
congressional
authorization
just
says...
gives
permission
to
states
for
the
1
year.
isn't
that
right?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it
certainly
is.
as
justice
scalia
pointed
out--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--i...
i
don't
remember
starns
well
enough,
but
is
it
just
that
you
have
to
stay
for
1
year,
or
was
there
a
requirement
that
you
had
to
be...
establish
residency
before
you
started
college?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
right.
being
married
to
somebody
from
in-state
or--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
was
there
a
figure--
