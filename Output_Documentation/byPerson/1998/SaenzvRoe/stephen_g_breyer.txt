i
don't
understand
that.
i
mean,
if
i
have...
shapiro
i
guess...
shapiro,
for
whatever
theory
of
it,
i
mean,
it
holds,
doesn't
it
that
a
state
cannot
say
no
welfare
for
a
year,
and
the
reason
a
state
wanted
to
do
that
is
so
people
wouldn't
come
to
get
a
higher
welfare
benefit.
well,
you
say
not
no
welfare,
but
reduced
welfare
for
a
year,
and
the
reason
we're
doing
that
is
so
you
don't
move
here
to
get
a
higher
welfare
benefit.
i
mean,
what's
the
difference?
the
only
difference
is
you're
more
generous
but
not
really
that
much
more.
i
mean,
somewhat
more
generous.
what's
the
difference
in
the...
in
the...
in
the
theory
of
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
you
can't
just
use...
you
can't
save
money
just
by,
i
mean,
randomly
selecting
people
to
pay
less,
can
you?
i
mean,
we'll
save
$10
million
next
year
by
not
paying
money
to
anyone
whose
name
begins
with
q
or
reducing
their...
you
couldn't
do
that,
could
you?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
look,
what
i'm
trying
to
get
at...
let
me
just...
suppose
you
cut
30
percent
from
everybody
whose
name
began
with
q.
all
right?
i
say,
why
are
you
doing
that?
you
say,
to
save
money.
is
that
rational?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
thank
you,
mr.
garelis.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--what...
what...
what
would
you
say?
imagine
that
the
federal
government,
not
the
state,
were
to
set
up
some
special,
say,
inner-city
development
program
and
it
were
to
say,
now,
we
want
this
program
available
to
present
residents,
not
future
residents
of
the
inner-city,
for
we
fear
that
our
program
will
make
that
inner-city
so
attractive
to
a
large
number
of
people
who
are
in
worse
conditions
that
they
will
move
there,
destroying
the
program.
and
this
is
experimental,
et
cetera.
now,
can...
can
the
federal
government
do
that?
i.e.,
i'm
trying
to
focus...
you
to
focus
on
the...
what
i
take
is
the
sg's
argument
that
congress
says,
what
we're
trying
to
do
is
to
negate
an
incentive
to
move
to
the
extent
that
our
own
program
creates
it.
we
want
to
leave
that
incentive
where
we
find
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
they
say,
this
is
experimental.
our
program
won't
work
if
everyone
moves
to
the
inner-city
to
take
advantage
of
it.
it's
an
experimental
program.
we
want
to
work
with
the
residents
who
are
now
there,
not
new
residents.
and
all
we're
trying
to
do
is
to
negate
the
incentive
to
move
that
our
very
own
federal
program
itself
creates--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--which
i
take
is
a
very...
i'm
trying
to
do
a
variation
on...
you
can...
i'm
trying
to
make
it
more
poignant,
you
see.
[laughter]
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
why
is
it
a
variation
of
that,
that
if
congress
says,
look,
we
want
to
discourage
the
incentive
that
we
have
created...
well,
i
don't
know.
you
may
be
repeating
yourself.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
