mr.
mark
d.
rosenbaum
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
california
durational
residency
requirement
is
antithetical
to
core
structural
and
liberty-producing
values
of
our
federal
system
of
joint
sovereigns.
as
justice
ginsburg's
comment
indicated,
the
genius
of
our
federal
system
is
that
citizens
are
free
to
vote
with
their
feet.
they
are
free
to
migrate
to
and
settle
in
whatever
state
they
choose
based
on
whatever
needs
or
tastes
they
have.
mr.
mark
d.
rosenbaum
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
mark
d.
rosenbaum
well,
that
would
be
an
article
iv
question,
your
honor,
but
that...
that's
not
the--
mr.
mark
d.
rosenbaum
--your
honor
is
referring
to
a
nonresident.
is
that
right?
mr.
mark
d.
rosenbaum
the
answer,
justice
scalia,
was
most
recently
stated
in
this
court's
opinion
in
bray
at
page
277,
and
that
is,
we
are
at
a
point
in
the
jurisprudence
that
the
right
of
free
interstate
migration
includes
not
only
protection
against
the
erection
of
actual
barriers,
but
it
means
that
interstate
travelers
are
treated
no
differently
than
intrastate
travelers.
the
same
point
that--
mr.
mark
d.
rosenbaum
--the...
the
problem
with--
mr.
mark
d.
rosenbaum
--i
don't...
don't
agree
with
that,
your
honor.
mr.
mark
d.
rosenbaum
because
the
second
part
of
the
equation
with
respect
to
the
liberty
producing
values
that
we're
talking
about
is
that
once
an
individual
chooses
to
move
to
a
state
for
whatever
reason
she
chooses,
establishes
bona
fide
residence,
the
constitution
creates
a
relationship
between
the
citizen
and
the
state.
mr.
mark
d.
rosenbaum
--your
honor--
mr.
mark
d.
rosenbaum
--it
may
well
be,
your
honor,
that...
that
an
individual
who...
who
is
not
a
bona
fide--
mr.
mark
d.
rosenbaum
--your
honor,
we're...
in
the
circumstances
that
you're
describing
where
we're
not
dealing
with
a
bona
fide
resident,
sure
the
state
can
make
all
sorts
of
distinctions.
this
court
said
so
in
martinez
v.
binen.
mr.
mark
d.
rosenbaum
the
problem
in...
in
this--
mr.
mark
d.
rosenbaum
--because--
mr.
mark
d.
rosenbaum
--because
the
right
of
interstate
migration,
the
right
of
free
interstate
migration,
has
two
components
not
just
against
actual
barriers
themselves,
but
when
an
individual
establishes
bona
fide
residence,
that
individual
becomes
the
state's
own.
and
the
state
cannot--
mr.
mark
d.
rosenbaum
--the
reason--
mr.
mark
d.
rosenbaum
--no,
your
honor.
the
right...
the
right
to
travel
that
we're
talking
about
is
a
right
not
to
be
discriminated
against
based
upon
the
length
of
residence.
why
is
that?
because
if
a...
if
a
state
could
discriminate
based
upon
the
length
of
residence
for
a
bona
fide
residence,
then
it
would
radically
revise
the
federal
system.
it
would
mean--
mr.
mark
d.
rosenbaum
--your
honor?
mr.
mark
d.
rosenbaum
i'm
sorry.
mr.
mark
d.
rosenbaum
your
honor,
there
are
four
sources,
in
addition
to
the
logic
and
structure
of
the
constitutional
scheme
itself.
first,
as
your
honor
stated
and
as
your
honor
specifically
described
in
the
zobel
concurrence
and
in
your
honor's
dissent
in
soto-lopez,
article
iv,
section
2.
in
addition,
the
fourteenth
amendment,
through
the
citizenship
clause,
the
privileges
or
immunities
clause,
and
the
equal
protection
clause.
those
four
provisions
of
the
constitution
create
a
principle.
the
principle
is
that
a
state
may
not
negate
a
national
citizen's
right
of
choice
of
state
of
residence
by
classifying
newcomers
so
as
to
deny
them
the
same
rights--
mr.
mark
d.
rosenbaum
--the
tuition
cases
are
just
as
justice
scalia
indicated,
your
honor.
the
issue
in
the...
the
tuition
cases,
like
the
starns
case,
as
this
court
explained
in...
in
the
zobel
case
and
in
vlandis,
the
issue
there
was,
was
an
individual
in
fact
a
bona
fide
resident?
of
course,
a
state
may
preserve
its
state
resources
for
state
citizens.
mr.
mark
d.
rosenbaum
let
me
answer
that
in
two
ways,
your
honor.
first,
in...
in
the
school
tuition
cases
themselves,
as
the
court
indicated
at
vlandis
at
pages
253
and
254,
the
concern
was
with
a
population
that
was
characteristically
transient
and,
as
justice
ginsburg
said,
coming
in
to
take
the
benefit
and
run,
a
concern
that,
in
fact,
we
have
a
permanent
attachment,
a
genuine
attachment.
in
dunn,
while
the
court
said,
sure--
mr.
mark
d.
rosenbaum
--no,
your
honor.
mr.
mark
d.
rosenbaum
no.
the
concern
was--
mr.
mark
d.
rosenbaum
--because--
mr.
mark
d.
rosenbaum
--i...
i'm...
perhaps
i'm
not
communicating
clearly,
your
honor.
the
problem
in
starns
and
the
school
tuition
cases
is
that
a
state
has
a...
has
a
compelling
interest,
has
an
absolutely
appropriate
right
to
say
before
we
give
some
of
our
basic
resources
that
we
would
otherwise
reserve
to
our
state
citizens,
we
want
to
make
sure
that
this
individual
is
in
fact
a
bona
fide
resident,
has
some
sort
of
permanent
attachment.
that's
why
the
case...
and...
and
with
students,
peculiarly
a...
a
characteristically
transient
population,
there
was
reason
to
be
suspicious
of
the
motives
of
the
individuals
coming
in.
compare
that
to
this
case.
as
the
state
has
conceded,
as
recently
as
pages
17
and
18
of
its
reply
brief,
there's
no
question
that
we're
dealing
with
bona
fide
residents
in
this
case.
indeed,
the
state
concedes
that
it
could
not...
an
individual
could
not
get
any
sort
of
benefit
whatsoever--
mr.
mark
d.
rosenbaum
--no.
mr.
mark
d.
rosenbaum
your
honor,
that's--
mr.
mark
d.
rosenbaum
--it
was
that
you
had
to
be
either
an
established
resident
or
that
you
demonstrate
that
you
will...
in
fact,
are
a
bona
fide
resident
for
the
1--
mr.
mark
d.
rosenbaum
--yes,
and
it
may
well
be
that...
that
1
year
or
5
years
would
be
too
long.
that
was
the
problem
in
dunn,
chief
justice
rehnquist.
the
problem
in
dunn
was
that
the
1-year
requirement,
if
in
fact
intended
to
establish
bona
fide
residence,
was
too
long.
in
fact,
this
court
also
said
in
dunn
that
the
3-month
county
requirement
was
too
long.
but
that's
a
different
issue.
that's
the
issue
of
how
long
can
a
state
say
it's
appropriate
before
bona
fide
residence
is
established.
mr.
mark
d.
rosenbaum
and...
and
in
your
hypothetical,
justice
breyer,
newcomers
are
being
locked
out
of
the
program.
is
that
right?
mr.
mark
d.
rosenbaum
i--
mr.
mark
d.
rosenbaum
--i'm
very
moved,
your
honor.
[laughter]
let
me
answer
that
in...
in
two
ways,
your
honor.
for
the
reasons
that
justice
o'connor
and
justice
kennedy
and
justice
souter
indicated,
the
answer
is
no.
congress
could
not
do
that.
why
can't
congress
do
it?
well,
first,
this
court
has
said
so.
this
court
said
so
at
page
642
of
shapiro
and
this
court
said
so
recently
in
the
bray
case,
that
the
right
of
interstate
migration
in
footnote
7,
doesn't
come
from
a
negative
commerce
clause.
it's
a
right
that
derives
from
rights
that
cannot
be
eliminated
by
congress.
but
even
without
that
as
part
of
the
record,
what
would
it
mean
to
our
federal
system
if
congress
could
do
that?
this
court
has
never
held
that
a
state
could
defend
the
unconstitutionality
of
one
of
its
statutes
denying
individual
rights
by
resort
to
authorization
from
congress,
the
same
reason
congress
can't
violate
those...
those
sorts
of
individual
rights.
and
if
i
understand,
justice
kennedy,
your
concurring
opinion
in
thornton,
the
principle
here
is
that
this
structural
relationship
is
created
by
the
constitution.
it
is
part
of
the
unique
genius
of
the
system,
that
each
of
the
joint
sovereigns
has
a
relationship
with
the
citizens.
what
would
it
mean
if
congress
could
come
in
and
sever
the
relationship,
cause
a
state,
in
the
words
of
the
hooper
case,
to
renege
on
its
obligation
to
treat
citizens
as
their
own?
mr.
mark
d.
rosenbaum
do
i
think
it
would
be
unconstitutional,
chief
justice
rehnquist?
mr.
mark
d.
rosenbaum
i
think
it
would
be.
i
think
that
the
concerns
that
we
have
been
talking
about
this
morning,
the
liberty
producing
concerns
and
the
state
citizenship
concerns...
it
may
well
be
in
your
hypothetical,
if
i
understand
it
correctly,
that
some...
that
the...
the
relationship
between
the
state
and
the
citizen...
that
would
not
be
necessarily
affected
if
it
is
the
federal
government
that
is
running
an
exclusive
program.
but
in
terms
of
the
other
element
of
the
right
itself,
the
liberty
producing
element,
that
citizens--
mr.
mark
d.
rosenbaum
--i...
i'm
trying
to
take
it,
your
honor,
from
the
decisions
in
new
york
v.
united
states,
the
term
limits
case,
the
united
states
v.
lopez.
the
notion
which
i
believe
absolutely
saturates
this...
this
court's
doctrine
with
respect
to
the
right
of
interstate
migration,
as
justice
o'connor
stated
at
pages
76
and
77
of
the
zobel
concurrence,
that
the
liberty-producing
element
is
that
citizens
are
free
to
vote
with
their
feet,
to
act
on
whatever
their
needs
or
tastes
are
in
terms
of
the
selection
of
the
state
in
which
they
live.
mr.
mark
d.
rosenbaum
your
honor,
i--
mr.
mark
d.
rosenbaum
--i...
i
agree
with
that.
in
fact--
mr.
mark
d.
rosenbaum
--i
understand
your
honor's
question.
let
me
see
if
i
can--
mr.
mark
d.
rosenbaum
--do
my
best
to
explain
it.
justice
scalia,
as
this
court
stated
in...
in
zobel,
the
equal
protection
analysis,
one
of
the
four
sources
that...
that
i
identified
earlier,
is
really
a
particular
application
of
the
right
of
interstate
migration.
why
is
it
significant
here?
i
don't
agree
that
rational
basis
is
the
test,
but
the...
the
notion
of
comparing
citizens,
your
honor,
is
what
emerges
from
the
right
itself
because
once
the
individual
initiates
the
move,
for
whatever
reason
that
she
chooses
to
move,
then
it
is
the
state's
responsibility,
its
constitutional
obligation,
to
treat
all
states
the
same.
and
that's
why
the
equal
protection
clause
is
an
appropriate
measuring
tool.
it
doesn't
matter
if
we're
talking
about
article
iv
or
the
privileges
or
immunities
clause
or
the
citizenship
clause.
the
principle
that
is
generated
is
that
citizens
must
be
treated
equally
by
their
state
when
it
comes
to
length
of
residence
or
state
of
prior
residence.
mr.
mark
d.
rosenbaum
the
answer,
your
honor,
is
really
what
this
case
is
about,
and
that
is
what
is
the
nature
of
citizenship.
how
must
citizens
be
treated
by
their
states?
and
the
reason
why
it
would
be
appropriate
for
the
state
in
some...
on
some
instances
to
treat
citizens
differently
than
just
residents...
vacationers,
travelers
for
hunting
licenses,
is
that
the
state
owes
a
responsibility,
an
obligation
to
its
citizens
with
respect
to
certain
of
its
resources
or
programs.
this
court
has
stated
in
martinez
v.
binen--
mr.
mark
d.
rosenbaum
--i
disagree
with
that,
your
honor.
this...
this
right,
as
court
stated
in
guest
at
page
728,
is
a
right
that
is
a
necessary
concomitant
to
a
stronger
union.
justice
o'connor
described
it
in
zobel
as
a
right
that
is
essential
to
the
union.
that--
mr.
mark
d.
rosenbaum
--your
honor--
mr.
mark
d.
rosenbaum
--i
do,
your
honor.
if
the
analysis
is
under
the
equal
protection
clause
or
the
citizenship
clause
or
the
privileges
or
immunities
clause,
then
strict
scrutiny
is
required
because
this
is
a
fundamental
right
and
because
a
durational
residency
requirement--
mr.
mark
d.
rosenbaum
--i...
i'm
sorry.
mr.
mark
d.
rosenbaum
your
honor,
i
may
have
been
imprecise
in
my
words.
when
i
said
privileges
or
immunity,
i
was
referring
to
the
fourteenth
amendment.
if
it
is
under
any
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
clauses,
then
i
believe
strict
scrutiny
applies
because
it
is
a
fundamental
right
because
it
negates
the
liberty-producing
values.
i
completely
agree
with
your
honor
for
the
reasons
stated
in
the
zobel
concurrence.
if
it
is
an
article
iv
analysis,
then
the
first
question
is,
are
newcomers
the
peculiar
sense...
peculiar
source...
the
first
question
is,
do
we
have
a
fundamental
right?
and
of
course,
we
have
a
fundamental
right.
it's
the
right
to...
to
migrate
to
and
settle
in
a
state.
then
the
next
question
is,
do
we
have
with
newcomers
a
peculiar
source
of
evil?
and
in...
in
this
case,
your
honor--
mr.
mark
d.
rosenbaum
--no
offense
to
justice
scalia,
but...
but
with
respect
to
the...
the
right
you're
talking
about--
mr.
mark
d.
rosenbaum
--then
we've
just
established
the
scalia
exception
to
article
iv.
[laughter]
your
honor,
with
respect
to...
to...
to
that
sort
of...
of
right,
i
think
your
honor
is
quite
correct.
first,
i
don't
think
we
have
a
fundamental
right
if
it's
not
for
commercial
reasons,
but
in
any
case
it
would
not
be
implicated
in
the
same
way
that
the
right
to
migrate
and
settle
is.
then
the
next
question
under
article
iv
is,
are
the
newcomers
the
peculiar
source
of
evil?
newcomers
aren't
the
peculiar
source
of
evil.
frankly,
they
are
not
empirically
in
any
sense.
in
this
case,
to
answer
the
question
that
was
asked
earlier
by
justice
stevens,
the
percent
of
the
budget
that
is
implicated
in
this
case...
of
the
welfare
budget...
is.38
percent
of
that
budget.
mr.
mark
d.
rosenbaum
but
in...
but
the...
the
issue
is
different
in
this
case,
your
honor,
because
we
are
dealing
with
a
fundamental
right,
the
right
to
migrate,
to
settle.
the
only
way
that
newcomers
could
be
considered
the
peculiar
source
of
the
evil
is
if
an
impermissible
purpose
is
added,
and
that
is,
we
don't
want
them
here.
we
don't
want
needy
people
coming
into
the
state,
which
is
precisely,
justice
kennedy,
what
the
district
court
and
the
circuit
court
found
in
this
case
with
respect
to
the
purpose
in
the
situation.
and
then
the
last
question,
justice--
mr.
mark
d.
rosenbaum
--that...
that
pretty
much
trumps
my
argument,
your
honor.
[laughter]
mr.
mark
d.
rosenbaum
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
and...
and
the
court
has
used
different
phrases,
right
of
interstate...
free
interstate
migration,
right
of
travel,
right
to
settle
and
migrate.
but
we're
talking
about
the
same
thing.
we're
talking
about
coming
to
a
state
for
whatever
need
or
taste,
picking
that
state
that's
best
suited,
and
then
settling
in
that
state.
now,
let
me
conclude
with
the
last
point
of
the
test,
your
honor,
with
respect
to
article
iv.
i
think
california
flunks
the
test
when
it
comes
to
are
newcomers
a
source
of
evil.
it
also
flunks
the
test,
your
honor,
with
respect
to
whether
or
not
the
relationship
can
be
explained,
whether
or
not
there's
a
substantial
relationship
between
the
discrimination
itself
and
the
evil
that
is
intended.
well,
as
i
said,
there
is
no
evil
here
with
respect
to
newcomers
unless
we
radically
change
the
nature
of
our
federal...
federal
system
so
that
newcomers
can
be
boxed
out
of
states
so
that
even
newcomers
coming
for
particular
purposes
can
be
boxed
out
for
particular
reasons,
which
this
court
has
specifically
said--
mr.
mark

--your
honor,
first,
i
don't
believe
rational
basis
is...
is
to
be
applied
here.
but
the
answer
is...
is...
is
still
no,
your
honor,
for
some
of
the
reasons
that
justice
breyer
indicated
with
his
q
example,
whether
or
not
you
could
exclude
people
who
are...
are...
have
the
name
starting
with
q.
and
that
is
because,
first,
your
honor,
newcomers
have
no
less
burdens,
they
are
no...
no
more
likely
to
be
able
to
deal
with
the
cuts
in...
in
welfare,
here
up
to
78
percent,
than
longer-term
residents.
moreover,
this
statute,
unlike
any
statute
that
has
ever
been
before
this
court,
also
discriminates
based
on
the
state
of
residence.
it
treats
citizens
as
if
they
crossed
the
border
wrapped
in
state
flags.
and
there
is
no
reason
to...
to
assume
that
a
individual
from
mississippi
has
80
percent
less
needs
than
an
individual
from
alaska.
so,
it
would...
it
would
flunk
the
rational
basis
test
as
well,
your
honor.
moreover,
congress
itself
would
have
other
means
to
deal
with
it,
as
it
has
dealt
with
it
in
other
situations.
if
congress
was
really
concerned
about
it,
congress
could
subsidize
those
states
that
were
subject
to
large
numbers
of
individuals
coming
in.
but
the
basic
principle,
what
this
case
is
involved
with,
is
that
states...
citizens
select
states.
states
cannot
select
citizens,
and
states
may
not
make
priority
judgments
based
upon
the
length
of
residence
or
the
state
of
prior
residence.
mr.
mark
d.
rosenbaum
it
would
not,
your
honor.
this
court
in...
in
shapiro
at
page
639--
mr.
mark
d.
rosenbaum
--it
would,
your
honor.
it
would
be
an
impermissible
purpose--
mr.
mark
d.
rosenbaum
--yes,
your
honor.
the
logic
and
structure,
plus
the
four
clauses
that
i
discussed.
mr.
mark
d.
rosenbaum
the
article
iv
and
the...
the
citizenship
clause
and
the
privileges
or
immunities
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment,
equal
protection
generate
a
right
that
states
cannot
negate
choices
of
citizens
or
can't
pick
and
choose
choices.
that's
not...
that
may
be
a
question
for
the
federal
government
to
ask--
mr.
mark
d.
rosenbaum
--and
i
think--
mr.
mark
d.
rosenbaum
--that
is
correct.
that
is
the
second
reason
why
this
statute
is
unconstitutional.
and,
your
honor,
that--
mr.
mark
d.
rosenbaum
--may
i
answer
your
question?
mr.
mark
d.
rosenbaum
it
is...
it
is
because
of
the
means
that
would
be
chosen
and
that
is
making
the
discrimination
based
upon
the
length
of
residence
or
the
state
of
prior
residence.
that's
what
makes
it
impermissible.
mr.
mark
d.
rosenbaum
thank
you,
your
honor.
