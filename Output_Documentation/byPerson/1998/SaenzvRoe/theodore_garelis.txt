mr.
theodore
garelis
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
we
are
here
today
because
california
has
been
stymied
and
hampered
in
its
efforts
to
exercise
flexibility
implementing
a
nationwide
congressionally
authorized
program
of
welfare
reform.
california
is
merely
asking
that
its
statutes
be
judged
under
the
traditional,
appropriate,
rational
basis
analysis
standard
and
not
under
strict
scrutiny
which
is
unduly
restrictive.
strict
scrutiny,
as
we
all
know,
is
appropriate
only
in
an
equal
protection
context--
mr.
theodore
garelis
--i
think
what--
mr.
theodore
garelis
--i
am
not
asking
you
to
abandon
the
stricter
test.
what
i'm
asking
you
to
recognize
is
that
our
statute
does
not
either
impact
a
fundamental
right
to
travel
or
suspect
class
or
any
other
right.
our
statute
is--
mr.
theodore
garelis
--except
that
our
durational
residency
requirement,
because
it
affects
only
a
benefit
level
decision...
it
does
not
affect
eligibility...
is
not
therefore
a
penalty.
a
penalty
would
be
something,
in
the
context
of
this,
where
someone
moving--
mr.
theodore
garelis
--because
our
statute
is
carefully
crafted
to
avoid
the
considerations
that
you're
talking
about,
your
honor,
our
statute
is
carefully
crafted
to
be
a
temporary
level,
a
temporary
level
of
1
year,
and
the
family
is
eligible
for
all
of
california's
welfare
benefits.
the
family
is
eligible
for
cash
aid.
it's
just
a
benefit-setting
adjustment
for
a
period
of
1
year.
mr.
theodore
garelis
yes,
it
would
be
if...
if
the...
if
our
statute
touched
on
the
right
to
travel
more
than
just
incidentally
and
remotely,
and
at
best
our
statute
impacts
upon
that
right
remotely
and
incidentally.
any
change
in
benefits
level
or
any
change
in
life
condition
upon
somebody's
move
obviously
affects
somebody's
decision
to
move.
people
move
from
one
state
to
the
other
based
upon
a
wide
variety
of
reasons.
this
is
just--
mr.
theodore
garelis
--california
is
not
picking
its
people,
and
people
are
fully
able--
mr.
theodore
garelis
--but
the
cases
that
discuss
this
do
it
in
terms
of
cases
like
shapiro
and
memorial
hospital
where
there's
an
absolute
denial
of
benefits,
and
we
do
not
have
an
absolute
denial
of
benefits.
our
newcomers--
mr.
theodore
garelis
--but
there
was
a
complete
denial
of
non-emergency
care,
and
we
don't
have
that
in
our
case.
what
we
have
is
people
are
entitled
to
benefits.
states
are
entitled
to
set
benefits
at
the
rate
that
they
believe
is
consistent
with
their
budgetary
constraints.
mr.
theodore
garelis
no.
mr.
theodore
garelis
no.
the
objective
of
the
statute
is
clear
on
the
face
of
the
statute:
number
one,
to
save
money;
number
two,
to
help
reform
the
welfare
system
by
removing
a
possible
incentive
to
move
to
a
higher
benefit
level
state.
mr.
theodore
garelis
there
is
an
impact
on
the
right
of
travel,
but
it's
not
sufficient.
it
is
only
remote
and
incidental
at
best.
mr.
theodore
garelis
i'm
sorry.
i
don't
understand.
mr.
theodore
garelis
no,
it
isn't
because,
as
i
stated,
we're
making
a
very
careful
distinction
here.
we're
not
trying
to
deter
travel
in
any
way,
shape,
or
form.
because
our
statute
is
carefully
crafted
for
a
temporary
limit
and
people
are
given
the
rate
that
is
the
maximum
made
payable
in
their
prior
state
of
residence
and
it's
only
one
part
of
our
panoply
of
welfare
benefits,
it
is
not
a
deterrent.
we
are
merely
neutralizing
one
factor
that
somebody
might
care
to
consider
when
moving
to
california.
that
is
not--
mr.
theodore
garelis
--that's
correct.
mr.
theodore
garelis
well,
in...
under
shapiro,
the
people
affected
by
those
statutes
were
not
eligible
for
benefits.
here
people
are
eligible
for
benefits.
mr.
theodore
garelis
it's
constitutional
because
our
statute
should
be
judged
under
the
rational
basis
standard.
under
shapiro,
they
used
strict...
your...
this
court
used
strict
scrutiny,
and
under
our
statute,
because
we
have
a
temporary
benefit
setting
level
and
because
people
are
entitled
to
welfare
at
a
state
mandated
rate,
to
cash
aid
welfare,
and
they're
entitled
to
all
other
welfare
benefits,
our
statute
does
not
impact
on
the
right
to
travel
to
the
extent
that
was
prescribed
by
shapiro--
mr.
theodore
garelis
--and
i
believe
this
court
has
acknowledged
that
in
the
footnote
in
shapiro
which
states
that
not
all
waiting
periods
are
penalties
because
our
statute--
mr.
theodore
garelis
--i
don't...
i
don't
believe
in...
in
terms
of
the
footnote
in
shapiro,
that
it
makes
that
qualification.
this
court
has
stated
that
in
terms
of
the
sosna
case
and
the
cases
on
tuition,
but
we
believe
that
our
case
where
people
our...
are
eligible
for
welfare
benefits,
they...
they
receive
welfare
benefits.
the
only
thing
is
that
they're
receiving
them
at
a
state
mandated
rate.
and
whenever
somebody
moves
to
another
state,
people
do
get
different
rates
of
welfare
and
that
has
not
been...
of
cash
aid.
and
that
has
not--
mr.
theodore
garelis
--well,
i
don't
believe
so.
i
think
the
tax
situation
is
a
different
situation
because
you
have
so
many...
it
has
so
many
different
impacts.
you'd
have
to
look
at
and
see--
mr.
theodore
garelis
--well,
whenever
people
move
from
one
state
to
another,
there
are
differences...
changes
in
all
forms.
what
we're
merely
saying
is
that
none
of
those
differences,
et
cetera
are
customarily
judged
to
be
restrictions
on
the
fundamental
right
to
travel.
mr.
theodore
garelis
there's
something
very
different
and
distinct
about
what
california
is
doing
because
california
has
carefully
limited
what
it's
doing
to
merely
the
benefit
level,
and
states
have
the
prerogative
and
do
have
different
benefit
levels--
mr.
theodore
garelis
--i
think
what
you
have
to
look
at,
the
analysis
that
would
have
to
be
done
is
you
look
and
see
whether
or
not
there
has
been
a
detriment
to
the
person
who
has
moved.
is
there
a
difference
between
what
that
person
was
receiving
in
the
prior
state
compared
to
what
they're
receiving
in
california.
our
statute
is
carefully
crafted--
mr.
theodore
garelis
--okay.
mr.
theodore
garelis
since
it's...
since
it's
a
benefit,
since...
i
would
say
the
answer
is
it
would
be
the
same.
you
would
judge
it
under
the
rational
basis
scrutiny.
mr.
theodore
garelis
if
it's
an
easily
quantifiable
amount
and
you
can
tell
that
the
person
is
receiving
no
detriment
upon
moving,
if
it's--
mr.
theodore
garelis
--i
would
tend
to
say
that
it
would
probably
be
judged
under
the
rational
basis
scrutiny.
mr.
theodore
garelis
if
it's
temporary
and
if
there
is
no
detriment
to
the
person
when
they
cross
the
border--
mr.
theodore
garelis
--i...
i
don't
see
that
detriment,
no.
mr.
theodore
garelis
no.
i--
mr.
theodore
garelis
--i
believe--
mr.
theodore
garelis
--what
we
are
merely
suggesting
is
that
rational
basis
would
be
the
correct
scrutiny.
it
does
not
impact
on
a
fundamental
right--
mr.
theodore
garelis
--well,
i
believe
the
sosna
case
leads
you
towards
that
direction.
this
court's
footnote
in
the
shapiro
case,
which
was
taken
up
in
the
memorial
hospital
case,
where
waiting
periods
have
not
been
regarded
as
absolutely
a
penalty.
i
believe
that
this
precedent
of
this
court
would
fully
support
that.
in
sosna,
in
the
tuition
cases,
there
have
been
acknowledged
that
there
is
maybe
an
impact
on
travel
but
it
is
not
strong
enough.
it
does
not
meet
the...
the
standards
that
are
set
out--
mr.
theodore
garelis
--i
recognize
that,
but
on
the
other
hand,
the
question
was
has
it
been
determined
that
a...
by
this
court
that
a
waiting
period
that
does
not
impact...
that
waiting
periods
don't
necessarily
impact
the
fundamental
right
to
travel
absolutely.
what
this
court
has
determined,
that
not
all
waiting
periods
impact
the
right
to
travel.
and
we
are
simply
saying
that
our
statute
does
not
impact
the
right
to
travel
sufficiently
to
trigger
strict
scrutiny.
mr.
theodore
garelis
the
congressional
authorization
is
important
because
it
shows
that
the
concerns
underlying
the
right
to
travel
are
met
and
have
been
considered
by
this
program
because
the
right
to
travel...
the
point
of
this...
of...
of
this
court's
concerns
and
all
of
our
concerns
about
the
right
to
travel
is
whether
it
breaks
up
our
country.
does
it
vulcanize
various
states?
the
federal
authorization
shows
that
these
concerns
are
greatly
minimized
by
congress'
action.
mr.
theodore
garelis
congress
is
not
saying
go
ahead
and
vulcanize.
congress
is
simply
saying
that
nationwide
we
have
a
determination,
we
have
a
policy
that...
that
we
will
reduce
this
particular
incentive
to...
that
may
impact
on
a
person's
decision
to
travel.
mr.
theodore
garelis
it's
a
legitimate
purpose
because,
number
one,
congress
has
shown
that
the
concerns
underlying
the
right
to
travel
are
greatly
minimized
in
this
case
and
it...
and
it
also--
mr.
theodore
garelis
--well,
i...
i
think
the
point
really
here
is
that
nobody
is
being
denied
welfare
benefits.
mr.
theodore
garelis
they're
being
denied
those
benefits
and
those
benefits
simply
are
not
substantial
enough
to
trigger
strict
scrutiny.
mr.
theodore
garelis
basically,
yes.
mr.
theodore
garelis
because
the--
mr.
theodore
garelis
--there's
no
guarantee
that
the
amount
of
cash
aid
is
adequate
in
either
the
state
that
someone
is
coming
from
or
the
state--
mr.
theodore
garelis
--i
would
beg
to
differ
with
your
honor
on
one
point.
there's
been
no
determination
by
the
state
of
california's
legislature,
when
it
set
the
cash
aid
benefits,
that
that
amount
met
any
basic
standard
or
anything.
it
was
simply
the
amount
that
that
legislature
determined--
mr.
theodore
garelis
--budgetary
constraints
of
the
state
of
california.
mr.
theodore
garelis
i
believe
that's
exactly
what
it
is.
the...
the
rate,
the
level
of
benefits
is
not
keyed
or
tied
into
or
reflective
of
any
certain
standard
of
living.
mr.
theodore
garelis
sure.
mr.
theodore
garelis
no,
i
don't
believe...
i'm...
i'm
not
aware
of
what
the
record
states
the
whole
impact
on
the
budget.
we
set
out
in
our
petition
the
amount
of
the
expected
cost
savings
for
this
program.
but
really,
the
point
is,
is
that
the
legislature
determined
that
this
was
an
adequate
cost
savings
amount
to
justify--
mr.
theodore
garelis
--excuse
me?
mr.
theodore
garelis
yes.
yes,
they
do.
mr.
theodore
garelis
as--
mr.
theodore
garelis
--i'm
not
aware
of
the
percentage--
mr.
theodore
garelis
--i...
i...
i'm
not
aware
of
those
figures.
mr.
theodore
garelis
as
stated
at
page
appendix
37
of
our
petition,
paragraph
6,
for
the
'97-'98
fiscal
year,
the
california
department
of
social
services
projected,
because
we
haven't
been
able
to
implement
the
statute...
projected
that
the
implementation
of
the
statute
would
reduce
total
afdc,
now
tanf,
expenditures
by
$22.8
million,
and
of
that
total
reduction,
california
general
fund
expenditures
would
be
reduced
by
$10.9
million.
mr.
theodore
garelis
well,
if...
if
that
does
not
impact
the
fundamental
right
and
does
not
impact
a
suspect
class,
then
that
program
would
be
adjudicated
under
a
rational
basis--
mr.
theodore
garelis
--i
think
my
answer
would
be
different
for
a
variety
of
reasons,
your
honor.
mr.
theodore
garelis
i
think
very
probably
so,
your
honor.
i
think
you
have
to
perform
the
analysis
and
see
whether
or
not
a...
a
program
that's
different
than
what
california
has
impacts
sufficiently
on
the
fundamental
right
to
travel
strict
scrutiny.
a--
mr.
theodore
garelis
--anytime
you
increase
the...
the
disability
under
which
the
person
is
impacted,
obviously
you're
getting
closer
and
closer
to
something
in
shapiro
and
memorial
hospital,
which
is
an
absolute
denial.
but
because
california
has
chosen
very
carefully
the
period
of
1
year,
which
is
a
period
that
this
court
has
recognized
in,
as
i've
stated
before,
the
sosna
case,
this
did
not
in
that
case
implicate
the
right
to
travel
sufficiently.
1
year
would
appear
to
be
an
amount
that
would
not...
a
time
period
that
would
not
sufficiently
impact.
mr.
theodore
garelis
at
every
point
where
you
increase
the
time
period,
the
temporary
time
period,
i
think
you're
getting
closer
and
closer
to
a
permanent.
i
don't
know
where
2
years
would
be.
5
years
sounds
like
an
awful
lot,
especially
in
consideration
of
the
fact
that
people
are
entitled
to
welfare
eligibility
in
california
for
5
years,
which
is
the
maximum
amount
allowable
under
federal
law.
so,
5
years
would
definitely
seem
to
me
to
be
a
real
problematic
situation
if
i
was
trying
to
argue
rational
basis.
but
we're
not.
mr.
theodore
garelis
why
did
the
state
pick
1
year?
mr.
theodore
garelis
1
year--
mr.
theodore
garelis
--1
year
would
appear
to
be
an
amount
that...
that
does
not
sufficiently
implicate
the
right
to
travel.
it's
not
that
long
a
time--
mr.
theodore
garelis
--i
think
they
thought
it
was
the
amount
that
was...
would
be
constitutionally
appropriate.
mr.
theodore
garelis
that
would
not
appear
to
be
rational,
and
i'm
not
going
to
argue
that
it
is
rational.
however,
our
statute
would
appear
to
be
rational.
mr.
theodore
garelis
thank
you.
