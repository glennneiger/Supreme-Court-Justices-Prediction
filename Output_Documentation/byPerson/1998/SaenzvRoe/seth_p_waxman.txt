mr.
seth
p.
waxman
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
what
distinguishes
this
case
from
the
other
interstate
migration
cases
that
this
court
has
decided
is
the
presence
of
an
explicit
federal
authorizing
statute
part
as
a...
part
of
a
comprehensive
national--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--well,
justice--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--i...
i
would
like
to
explain
it
and
i
hope
to
explain
it.
it's
our
submission
that
with
respect
to
interstate
migration,
which
is
both
a
right
of
national
citizenship
and
a
structural
feature
of
the
national
union,
congress
stands
in
a
position
that
is
fundamentally
different
than
any
state
legislature.
in
shapiro
v.
thompson
and
maricopa
county,
this
court
said--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--congress
cannot
eliminate
the...
the
right
of--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--congress
can
regulate
interstate
movement
and
to
some
extent
it
can
define
the--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--i
don't
know
whether
it
could
do
it
purely
for
that
purpose,
but
just
as
congress
but
not
the
states
can
regulate
and
burden
interstate
commerce,
congress
can
also
define
to
some
extent
the
incidence
of...
the
incident
of
national
citizenship
that
constitutes
the
interest
in
migration.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
and
i
suggest--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--well,
i
think,
justice
souter,
it's
important
when
one
talks
about
the
right
to
travel,
which
is
an
enormously
inarticulate
phrasing
of
essentially
an
interest
that
encompasses
both
a
prohibition
or
a
restraint
against
direct
impediments
to
move
from
one
state
to
another
and
a
prohibition
against
the
states
treating
some
of
their
residents
less
well
than
others
because
of
recent
migration,
in
effect,
putting
a
penalty
on
people
for
recent
migration.
the
national
legislature
unlike
any...
a
state
legislature
acts
properly
to
pursue
its
own
interests
and
the
interests
of
its
citizens
counter
to,
and
perhaps
at
the
expense
of,
other
states
and
the
citizens
of
other
states.
and
this
court,
starting
from
chief
justice
taney
in
the
passenger
cases,
through
edwards
and
many
other
cases,
has
recognized
that
in
that
respect,
a
state
legislature
stands
in
a
different
position--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--well,
congress...
for
example,
in
shapiro,
the
court
said
a
state
may
not
act
to
fence
out
poor
people
or
may
not
act
to
fence
out--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--the
congress
is
not
fencing
anybody
out.
congress
is
the
legislative
body
that
represents
all
of
the
people
of
the
united
states.
all
of
the
indigent
people
of
the
united
states
are
here.
and
in
edwards,
for
example,
this
court
found
it
significant
that
california
could
not
impose
a
burden
because
it
was
imposing
a
burden
on
people
who
were
not
represented
by
that
state
legislature.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
i
don't
think
it
does
per
se.
what's
a
little
bit
confusing
about
this
case
is
we
neither
have
a
pure
state
program
such
as
was
at
issue
in
this
court's
prior
cases,
nor
do
we
have
a
pure
federal
program
in
which
congress
says,
okay,
we're
going
to
treat
welfare
like
social
security.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
i'm
sorry.
i
didn't--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--well,
the...
within
broad
limits--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--there
is...
this
is
a
national
program.
this
is
not
the
state's--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--within
limits...
within
limits
defined
by
congress
and
with
respect
to
the
authorization
that's
in
question
in
this
case.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
the
authorization
in
this
case
is
that
states
may
pursuant
to
a...
a
comprehensive
national
program
for
an
important
purpose
that
congress
articulated,
allow
states
to
apply
a
transitional
choice
of
law
rule
that
congress
thought
would
be
important.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
well,
the
question
is...
as
a
strict
matter,
justice
ginsburg,
you're
correct.
i've
used
it
in
an
analogic
sense
or
descriptive
sense
because
a...
congress
has
allowed
a
state
to
say,
assuming
that
it
isn't...
that
it
tailors
its
implementation
to
the
purposes
that
congress
had,
which
i...
i
would...
i
hope
i'll
be
able
to
describe,
to
apply
the
benefit
levels
of
a
prior
state.
and
both
california
and
the
prior
state,
because
of
the
way
tanf
works,
do
have
an
interest
in
that
happening.
the
prior
state
has
an
interest
because
it
will
be
penalized.
the
1996
act
envisions
a
mutual
commitment
between
states
and
welfare
recipients.
the
states
have
a
commitment
to
provide
indigents
with
individualized
support,
training,
and
opportunities
they
need
to
get
a
job
within
a
fixed
period
of
time,
and
it
obligates
recipients
to
commit
to
participate
in
and
to
stick
with
a
particular
state's
program
so
that
it
has
a
chance
to
work.
now,
what
section
604(c)
does
is
to
permit
states
to
neutralize
artificial
incentives
that
the
act
itself
produces
for
both
states
and
individuals
to
act
in
ways
that
may
diminish
the
efficacy
of
the
federal
program
itself.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
well,
california
has
not
interpreted
the
federal
authorization
that
way,
and
we
don't
think
that
it
has
to.
that
is,
we
think
that
the
statute
permits
a...
a
state
in...
the
new
state
to
apply
either
all
the
benefit
levels
of
the
prior
state
for
a
year,
that
is,
to
choose
to
apply
that
state's
rule.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
justice
ginsburg,
let...
let
me
be
perfectly
clear.
we
are
not
suggesting
here
that
the
presence
of
a
comprehensive
federal
system
and
the
presence
of
a
federal
authorization
makes
this
or
any
other
law
okay.
our
submission
is
that
if
a
state
acts
to
implement
the
authorization
under
604(c),
that
implementation
ought
to
be
tested
under
a
level
of
scrutiny
in
which
it
should
be
upheld
if
the
state
can
show
that
it
has
reasonably
tailored
its
implementation
to
the
important
federal
purposes
of
the...
purposes
of
the
federal
statute.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
that's
exactly...
and
we--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--in
our--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--in
our
brief,
justice
o'connor,
we
have
suggested
that
it
appears
to
us
that
california
has
not,
in
fact,
tailored
it,
and
therefore
the
court
ought
to
affirm
the
preliminary
injunction.
if
you
look
at
what
other
states
have
done,
illinois,
for
example,
has
one
of
these
residency
requirements
or
two-tier
systems,
but
it
won't
apply
unless
the
new
resident
was
obtaining
welfare
benefits
from
the
prior
state.
you
could
also
tailor
it
by
saying
that
it
won't
apply
to
people
who
come
to
the
state,
as
at
least
one
of
these
plaintiffs
did,
for
a
job
and
then
lose
it
because
those
kinds
of
people
congress
wanted
to...
it's
clear
congress
wanted
to
encourage
people
to
move
in
order
to
obtain
work.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
may...
may
i
answer?
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
the
congressional
authorization
simply
sets
the
outer
bounds
of
what
congress
will
permit
a
state
to
do,
but
it
does
not
give
them
a
free
pass
through
the
constitutional
test.
