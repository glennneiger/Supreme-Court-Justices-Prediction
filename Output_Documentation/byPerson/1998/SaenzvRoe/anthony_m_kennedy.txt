well,
just
on
that
standard
of...
of
review
point,
if
we
were
to
find...
and
i
know
you...
you
disagree
with
this,
but
if
we...
if
we
thought
that
the
right
of
travel
were
implicated
here,
were
affected
here,
would
the
standard
then
be
strict
scrutiny?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
i'm
puzzled
why
you
say
that
that...
that
that
is
not...
does
not
impact
the
right
of
travel.
i
thought
the
whole
purpose
of
this
was
to
discourage
migration
for
higher
welfare
benefits.
i
thought
that
was
the
objective
of
the
statute.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
that's
not
the
objective
of
the
statute.
what
is
it?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
all
right.
well,
then...
then
it
does
affect
the
right
of
travel.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
it's...
it's
the
second
of
the
two
purposes
you
offered
to
explain
the
statute.
i...
is
50
percent
substantial?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
you
said
that
there
were
two
objectives
of
the
statute.
one
was
to
save
money
and
the
other
was
to
deter
migration.
and
i
said,
well,
isn't
that...
migration
for
purposes
of
higher
welfare
benefits...
i
said
isn't
that
a...
a
substantial
impact.
it's...
at
least
one-half
of
the
purposes
that
you've
offered
affects
travel.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
mr.
garelis--
--i'm
writing
this
opinion
under...
under
your
view.
i
begin
by
saying
there
is
a...
less
of
an
impact
on
travel
in
this
case
than
in
shapiro.
therefore,
rational
basis,
not
strict
scrutiny
applies.
but
what
could
i
cite
for
that
then?
what
case
do
we
have
where
the
degree
of
impact
affects
the...
the
level
of
scrutiny?
that
seems
to
me
a
very
new
principle.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--if
i--
--if
we
were
to
disagree
with
you,
would
the
congressional
statute
make
a
difference?
are
you
going
to
argue
that
congress
can
somehow
permit
what
otherwise
would
not
be
allowed
under
the...
our
right
of
travel
cases?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
may
i
ask
you--
--in
justice
breyer's
hypothetical,
or
if
we
can
imagine
in
this
case
a
finding
that
if
the
congressional
policy
and
california's
policy
were
implemented,
welfare
rates
across
the
nation
would
rise,
would
that
be...
would
those
hypotheticals
meet
a
rational
basis
standard?
