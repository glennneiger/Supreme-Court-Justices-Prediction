chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
have
the
opinion
of
the
court
to
announce
in
two
cases.
the
first
of
them
no.
98-83,
wilson
against
layne
comes
to
us
from
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fourth
circuit.
the
respondents
here
are
officers
of
the
montgomery
county,
maryland
sheriff's
department,
united
states
marshals
service
who
executed
an
arrest
warrant
for
a
man
named
dominic
wilson
at
an
address
in
rockville,
maryland.
in
fact
this
was
the
home
of
his
parents,
the
petitioners
here.
the
officers
entered
the
dwelling
accompanied
by
two
washington
post
newspaper
reporters
pursuing
to
an
official
media
ride-along
policy.
this
entry
precipitated
a
confrontation
between
the
petitioners
and
the
police.
the
reporters
were
present
in
the
home
during
the
incident
observing
and
taking
pictures.
the
wilson's
sued
the
officers
who
they
alleged
had
violated
their
fourth
amendment
rights
by
bringing
the
media
along
during
a
home
entry.
the
district
court
denied
the
officers'
motions
for
summary
judgment
based
on
qualified
immunity,
and
a
divided
court
of
appeals
reversed
holding
that
the
law
was
not
clearly
established
at
the
time
of
the
search.
we
first
addressed
whether
the
officers
violated
the
fourth
amendment
rights
of
the
wilson's
when
they
brought
the
reporters
into
their
living
room
during
the
execution
of
an
arrest
warrant.
our
cases
in
the
common
law
have
afforded
strong
protection
to
the
right
of
residential
privacy.
we
held
in
payton
versus
new
york
that
an
arrest
warrant
carries
with
it
the
limited
authority
to
enter
a
person's
home
to
arrest
him
if
it
is
reasonably
believed
that
he
is
inside.
however,
the
authority
to
enter
a
home
to
make
an
arrest
is
a
limited
one
and
the
reporters
were
not
present
in
the
home
in
this
case
for
any
reason
related
to
the
justification
for
the
police
entry
into
the
home,
the
arrest
of
dominic
wilson.
although
the
officers
argued
that
the
presence
of
the
media
in
the
home
served
a
number
of
legitimate
law
enforcement
purposes.
these
generalized
objectives
are
not
sufficient
to
justify
bringing
the
media
into
a
private
home.
police
or
other
government
--
so
we
hold
that
this
was
the
violation
of
the
fourth
amendment
when
this
officers
brought
reporters
and
photographers
from
a
newspaper
into
a
private
home
which
they
had
access
to
only
by
reasonable
warrant.
but
police
or
other
government
officials
performing
their
duties
they
are
generally
entitled
to
immunity
shielding
them
from
liability
for
civil
damages,
unless
their
conduct
violates
clearly
established
rights
which
a
reasonable
person
would
have
known.
we
conclude
that
the
fourth
amendment
right
against
media
ride-along
was
not
clearly
established
at
the
time
of
this
search.
first,
the
fourth
amendment
question
presented
by
this
case
is
by
no
means
open
and
shut;
second,
although
media
ride-alongs
were
common
at
the
time
of
the
search
in
this
case
which
is
in
the
early
90s
at
that
time
there
were
no
judicial
opinions
holding
a
media
ride-along
became
unlawful
when
it
entered
a
home;
and
third,
the
officers
relied
on
a
departmental
ride-along
policy
which
permitted
ride-along.
we
agree
with
the
court
of
appeals
that
the
officers
are
entitled
to
qualified
immunity
and
so
we
affirm
its
judgment.
justice
stevens
has
filed
a
separate
opinion
concurring
in
part
and
dissenting
in
part.
