unknown
speaker
they
litigated
their...
what
does
litigating
their
objections
consist
of?
just
presenting
their
objections
to
the
court.
right?
unknown
speaker
i
mean,
they
weren't
subject
to
discovery
or...
or
to
any
of
the
other
procedures
that
a
party
is
subject
to.
right?
unknown
speaker
but
it
doesn't
follow
automatically
from
the
fact
that
you
submit
that
the
other
side
is
entitled
to
treat
you
like
a
party.
unknown
speaker
what
does
a
quasi
party
mean?
unknown
speaker
that
sounds
like--
--is
there
such
a
thing
as
intervening
just
for
the
purpose
of
objecting
to
the
settlement?
could
that...
has
that
happened
in
23.1
cases
where...
where
objectors
say,
we
want
to
intervene,
your
honor,
but
not
for
the
purpose
of
becoming
a
party
to
displace
the
named
representative,
just
to
object
to
the
judgment?
unknown
speaker
but
suppose
there
hadn't
been
a
settlement.
suppose
judgment
just
went
the
other
way.
your
client
would...
would
presumably
be
as
affected
by
an
adverse
judgment
as...
as...
as
by
an
adverse
settlement.
would
your
client
have
a
right
to...
to
take
an
appeal
then?
unknown
speaker
well,
i...
i...
i
can
fill
in
one
of
them.
they...
they...
they
sought
to...
sought
to
appear
and
object.
unknown
speaker
no.
they
didn't
seek
to
become
a
party.
they
didn't
seek
to
intervene,
any
more
than
your
client
did.
unknown
speaker
it
has
to
come
down
to--
unknown
speaker
--that...
that
one
provision
allowing
them
to
object
that
makes
the
difference,
it
seems
to
me.
but
how
do
you
object
if
there's
no
settlement?
i
don't
quite
understand
the
hypothetical.
unknown
speaker
i
don't
see
the...
the
need
for
those
rights
in
a
settlement
context
any
more
than
the
need
for
those
rights
in...
in...
in
a
judgment
context.
unknown
speaker
i
mean,
you're
right.
congress
has
provided
the...
this...
this
provision
for
notice,
but
whether
i
should
take
that
provision
for
notice
so
that
the
person
can
come
in
and
object
to
the
settlement,
whether
i
should
take
that
as
amounting
to
a
judgment
by
congress
that
this
individual
should
be
able
to
become
a
party
by
doing
that,
for
that
purpose
i...
i
am...
i
am
struck
by
the
fact
that
there's
no
difference
between
the
situation
of
that
person
when
there's
a
settlement
and
the
situation
of
a
shareholder
when
there's
been
an
adverse
judgment,
which...
which
the...
the
other
people
choose
not
to
take
up
and
he
would
like
to
take
up.
unknown
speaker
they
wouldn't
be
a
party
as...
in
the
terms
that
justice
scalia
described,
though,
would
they?
because
let's
say
you're
right.
they
get
to
appeal
from
the
settlement.
they're
not
a
party
when
the
case
is
then
reopened
in
the
district
court.
they're
still...
the
named
representative
is
still
there.
unknown
speaker
is
it
your...
is
it
your
position
that...
that
what
you're
urging
upon
us
applies
not
just
in
derivative
actions
but
in...
in...
in
class
action
suits?
unknown
speaker
one
of
the...
i'm
sorry.
i
didn't
mean
to
interrupt
you.
go
ahead.
unknown
speaker
i
was
going
to
say
one
of
the...
one
of
the...
the
points
that
was
made
toward
the
end
of...
of
your
opposing
counsel's
brief
was
that
if,
indeed,
the
same
rule
is
applied
to
rule
23,
the
result
is
going
to
be
incoherence
in
class
action
litigation.
is...
is...
has
there
been
any
experience
in...
in
the...
in
the
circuits
that
up
to
now
have...
have,
in
fact,
allowed
appeals,
as...
as
you...
as
you
argue
for,
that
suggest
that
there
is
going
to
be
incoherence
or
chaos
in...
in--
unknown
speaker
--what
about
class
actions
not
derivative?
unknown
speaker
were
there--
--how
many
courts
of
appeals
have
allowed
this
with
respect
to
class
actions
as
opposed
to
derivative
suits?
unknown
speaker
but
in
class
actions,
they're
non-named
parties,
but
they
are
parties.
isn't
that
so?
the...
in
a
regular
class
action,
there's
a
representative
of
a
class,
but
all
the
members
of
the
class
are
parties.
they're
not
named
parties,
but
they're
parties,
as
distinguished
from
the
23.1
where
the
objector
is
not
a
party.
unknown
speaker
well,
they're
bound,
as
a
practical
matter,
in
not
being
able
to
have
a
new
derivative
suit
i
suppose,
but
they're
not
bound
in
the
sense
that
class
action
members
who
do
not
opt
out
are
bound.
unknown
speaker
anybody
a
judgment
binds
can--
--we'll
recess
for
lunch
and
you
can
ponder
your
answer
to
justice
breyer's
question
during
lunch.
unknown
speaker
well,
mr.
kellogg,
could
they
even
intervene
of
right
under
the
conflict
or
the
tension
that
you
mentioned
before
between
rule
24
and
23.1?
that
is,
they
have
a
right
to
intervene
only
if
their
representation
isn't
adequate.
on
the
other
hand,
you
can't
have
a
champion
under
23.1
unless
he
is
an
adequate
representative.
unknown
speaker
and
then
it
could
be
then...
if...
if
you
can
show
that
you're
not
adequately
represented,
then...
then
there
should
not
have
been
the
recognition
of
the
champion
as
an
adequate
representative.
so,
you'd
have
to
dismiss
the
action.
unknown
speaker
you
could
make
the
same
argument
about
automatic
displacement.
in
fact,
automatic
displacement
is
worse.
i
don't
know
why
you
feel
better
about
saying
automatically
that
the
person
who
has
been
designated
as
an
adequate
representative
of...
of
the...
of
the
shareholders
is
not
an
adequate
representative--
unknown
speaker
--because
we're
going
to
let
this...
this
new
person
come
in
automatically
and
challenge
the
settlement.
unknown
speaker
is
it...
is
it
fair
to
say
that
the
right
that
you
have
under
23.1
assumes
that
there
are
going
to
be
some
circumstances
in...
in
which
there
will
be
an
inadequacy
and
that,
in
fact,
is
the
reason
why
the
right
to
notice
and
presumably
the
right
to
object
following
notice
is
given?
unknown
speaker
so,
you
would
not...
you
would
not
infer
from
the
inadequacy
of
the
settlement,
the
inadequacy
of
the
existing
plaintiffs
to
represent
the
shareholders.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
you
would
allow
somebody
to
appeal
who
could
not
have
been
a
representative
because,
say,
they
weren't
a
contemporaneous
owner.
would
you...
someone,
an
objector--
unknown
speaker
--where
does
the
right
to
object...
can
i...
where
does
the
right
to
object
come
from?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
why
not?
why...
why...
why
couldn't
it
foresee
intervening?
they
give
you
notice
so
you
could
intervene.
unknown
speaker
i
mean,
but
if
that's
the
issue
in
the
case,
that's
the
issue
in
this
case
presumably.
so...
so,
just
coming
fresh
to
the
rule,
if
you
read
the
last
sentence,
it
seems
to
give
you
notice,
but
not
a
right
to
object.
and...
and
so,
i...
i
wondered,
is
there
some
obvious
source
of
the
right
to--
unknown
speaker
--if
you
have
a
right
to
object
and
then
you
object
and
your
objection
is
denied,
then
you
would
seem
to
have
a
right
to
appeal.
but
if
you
don't
have
a
right
to
object,
all
you
have
or
do
is
a
right
to
intervene,
then
you
could
appeal
from
the
denial.
i
mean,
that
seems
to
be
the
issue
in
the
case,
and
you
seem
to
be
assuming
that...
that
this
gives
a
right
to
object.
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
yes,
yes,
i
agree
with
you.
i
just
wanted
to
see
if
there's
some
obvious
source
that--
unknown
speaker
--very
well,
mr.
kellogg.
mr.
frederick,
we'll
hear
from
you.
unknown
speaker
which
respondent's
brief
are
you
referring
to?
unknown
speaker
well,
now,
what
is
the
claim
preclusion
here?
it's...
it's...
it's
simply
that
these
shareholders
can't
bring
the
same
derivative
action.
that's
all
it
is.
that
seems
to
me
quite
different
from
the
class
judgment
that
binds
a
member
to
receive
a
certain
amount
in
settlement
of
his
monetary
claims,
et
cetera.
unknown
speaker
well,
what...
what
happens
here
is
this
corporation
can't
be
sued
again,
and...
and
the
right
is
still
a
derivative
one
in
this
case.
unknown
speaker
so,
if...
if
i
agreed
with
you
here,
why
wouldn't
the
same
be
true...
why
wouldn't
the
people
who
intervene
in
hart-scott-rodino
antitrust
procedures
also
get
a
right
to
appeal?
unknown
speaker
well,
what...
what
happens...
let's...
let's
assume
that...
that
you
allow
these
shareholders
to
appeal
and
they
do
appeal
and
the
settlement
is
set
aside.
all
right.
then
it
goes
back
down
and
they
come
up
with
another
settlement
that
is
perhaps
satisfactory
to
these
shareholders,
as
well
as
to
those
who
brought
the
suit.
i
suppose
notice
goes
out
again
and
yet
another
group
of
shareholders
can
object
to
the
settlement.
unknown
speaker
right,
and
they
can
take
up...
and
this
can
go
on
endlessly.
unknown
speaker
i...
i'm...
i'm
unaware
of
any
situation
where...
where,
you
know,
we
have
set
up
a
procedural
framework
that
lends
itself
to...
to...
to...
to
turning
into
a
perpetual
motion
machine.
unknown
speaker
and...
and...
and
this
one
certainly
does.
unknown
speaker
well,
isn't
present
anyway?
even
without
the
appeal,
you
could
always
have
objections
at
the
trial
level
and
they
might
be
sustained,
and
you
have
to
send
out
a
new
notice.
and
then
you
might
have
other
objections
and
a
new
notice.
it
could
happen
even
without
the
appellate
problem.
unknown
speaker
thank
you,
mr.
frederick.
mr.
kester,
we'll
hear
from
you.
unknown
speaker
it
cannot
change
any
of
the
issues
in
the
case.
is
that
not
true?
unknown
speaker
an
amicus
curiae,
at
least
in
our
court--
unknown
speaker
--cannot
enlarge
any
of
the
issues.
unknown
speaker
and,
of
course,
they're
not
bound
by
the
judgment
either.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
know,
but
you're
not
saying
they're
not
bound
by
the
judgment,
are
you?
unknown
speaker
well,
they
own
stock.
unknown
speaker
but
only
if
they
show
the
board
isn't...
is...
is
not
independent.
unknown
speaker
it
ends
with
a
derivative
claim.
there...
there
are--
unknown
speaker
--no
specific
individual
rights.
unknown
speaker
no,
but
to
the
extent
that
the
settlement
affects
the
value
of
the
stock...
and
often
a
settlement
will.
it
will
make
it
higher
or
lower.
if
there's
a
multimillion
dollar
claim
that's
compromised
or
multimillion
dollars
of
fees
that
are
paid,
that
can
affect
the
value
of
the
stock,
and
its
impact
on
the
value
of
the
stock
is
determined
for
all
of
the
shareholders
once
the
judgment
becomes
final.
so,
in
that
sense,
it's
binding
on
every
shareholder.
isn't
that
true?
unknown
speaker
no,
but
theoretically
some
settlements
do
affect
the
value
of
stock.
unknown
speaker
no,
no,
no.
unknown
speaker
it's
a
suit
on
behalf
of
the
corporation
and
the
individual
shareholder's
interest
in
the
outcome
is
measured
by
the
value
of
that
person's
stock.
unknown
speaker
well--
unknown
speaker
--well,
let
me
ask
you
this.
what
interest
does
the
named
plaintiff
have?
what
gives
him
standing
to
sue?
isn't
it
just
to
protect
the
value
of
his
stock?
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
and
the
basis
it
gives
him
the
standing
to
sue
is
precisely
the
same
basis
that
every
other
shareholder
has
except
they
may
have
fewer
or
more
shares
is
the
only
difference.
unknown
speaker
and
you
admit
the
plaintiff
has
standing
because
the
plaintiff
might--
unknown
speaker
--what?
unknown
speaker
because
the
plaintiff
might
be
hurt
because
the
value
of
his
shares
may
be
affected.
unknown
speaker
well,
it's
enough
of
a
certainty
to
provide
standing
under
article
3.
unknown
speaker
and...
and
precisely
the
same
interest
is...
is
controlled
for
every
other
shareholder
when
the
case
is...
is
terminated.
unknown
speaker
so
that
the
other
shareholder
is
bound
by
the
judgment
in
precisely
the
same
sense
that
the
plaintiff
who
brought
the
suit
is.
unknown
speaker
well,
are
you
suggesting
that
the
individual
could
then
turn
around
and
bring
an
individual
action
not
in
the
name
of
the
corporation?
unknown
speaker
but
for
precisely
the
same
injury
that
was
the
subject
of
the
derivative
action?
unknown
speaker
in
a
capacity
other
than
a
shareholder.
unknown
speaker
but
he
would
be
bringing
it
as
a...
i
mean,
his
claim--
unknown
speaker
--the
hypothesis
is--
unknown
speaker
--that
as
a
shareholder,
he
was
injured
because
his
stock
went
down--
unknown
speaker
--or
is
worth
less
than
it
would
have
been--
unknown
speaker
--yes,
but
it
couldn't
be
the
same
claim.
anyone
could
have
been
the
champion,
and
the
reason
they
could
have
been
is
because
they're
shareholders.
unknown
speaker
that
claim
is
cut
out.
and
i...
originally,
as
you
know,
23.1
was
part
of
rule
23.
is
the
argument
you're
making
peculiar
to
derivative
suits,
or
would
you
say
that
a
non-named
class
member
equally
cannot
appeal
from
a
settlement
unless
that
shareholder
intervened?
unknown
speaker
why
not?
the
same
thing--
unknown
speaker
--they
wouldn't
be
named.
all
of
your
arguments
about
rule
3(c),
if
they're
not
named
a
party,
they
haven't--
unknown
speaker
--but
textually
they
are
treated
just
about
identically
in
the
two
rules.
unknown
speaker
were
we
out
of
order
then
in
the
amchem
case?
was
it
last
year
or
the
year
before?
i
don't
remember.
but
was
it
not
so
in
that
case
that
non-named
class
members
who
were
not
permitted
to
intervene,
indeed
did
take
that
case
up
to
the
third
circuit
and
then
to
this
court.
unknown
speaker
but
marino...
that
was
a
case
of
antagonistic
interests.
let
me
put
it
bluntly.
it
seems
to
me
that
this
case
is
not
so
much
about
do
they
have
to
intervene,
but
whether
there
can
be
an
appeal
from
a
derivative
action
settlement.
unknown
speaker
because
as
i
read
the
rule,
they
have
no
right
to
intervene.
as
i
read
rule
24,
they
have
no
right
to
intervene.
unknown
speaker
they...
well,
they
don't
have
any
right,
but
then
it's
within
the
discretion
of
the
judge.
and
if
it's
permissive
intervention,
one
of
the
reasons
for
denying
permissive
intervention
is
it
would
delay
the
adjudication
of
the
rights
to
the...
of
the
original
parties.
and
if
a
judge
has
just
found
settlement
fair
and
reasonable,
wouldn't
that
be
exactly
the
case?
unknown
speaker
but
they
didn't
have
the
peculiar
problem
that
the...
that
the
23.1
objector
has;
that
is,
he
has
to
show
that
he's
not
adequately
represented
to
intervene
of
right.
that
is
in
certain
tension
with
the
court's
finding
already
that
the
representative
is
adequate.
and
then
when
we
get
down
to
rule
24(b),
permissive
intervention,
the
question
for
the
district
court
is
whether
the
intervention
will
unduly
delay
the
adjudication
of
the
rights
of
the
original
parties.
wouldn't
it
be
natural
for
a
judge
to
say,
sure,
this
is
going
to
cause
delay?
the
settlement
is
fair
and
reasonable.
unknown
speaker
but
at
least
we've
established
that
there
would
be
no
right...
that
this
settlement,
unless
the
district
judge
in
his
discretion
chose
to
allow
intervention,
would
be
immune
from
appellate
review.
unknown
speaker
and
that
would
be
abuse
of
discretion.
unknown
speaker
but
is
it
not
true...
do
you
dispute
the
fact
that
the...
in
response
to
the
notice,
a
shareholder
can
come
in
and
object
without
intervening?
unknown
speaker
well,
just
as
a
general
proposition,
would
you
say
that...
that
the
notice
is
sufficient
to
give
a
shareholder
standing
to
object
without
intervening?
unknown
speaker
is
it
not
the
fact,
though,
that
the
practice
of
district
judges--
unknown
speaker
--in
reviewing
has
always
been
to
allow
those
shareholders
to
respond
to
a
notice
to
make
their
objections--
unknown
speaker
--yes.
unknown
speaker
why...
why
if...
if
that's
open...
i
mean,
i'm
trying
to
figure
out
what
this...
what
the
case...
what
turns
on
this
case.
i
mean,
if...
if
you
say
you
have
to
take
the
rule
24
route,
then
people
who
think
that
it's
a
bad
decision,
settlement,
will
take
that
route.
and
the
district
judge
will
decide
it.
probably
if
he
likes
the
objections,
he'll
say
intervene
and
set
it
aside.
not...
not,
if
he
makes
a
mistake,
they
go
up
on
appeal
and
everybody
is
going
to
be
looking
at
the
fairness
of
the
settlement.
unknown
speaker
if
you
don't
take
the
24
route,
it's
the
same.
now,
i
mean,
either
way,
everybody
is
going
to
be
looking
at
the
settlement.
so...
so,
if
everybody
is
going
to
be
looking
at
the
settlement
either
way,
and
if
you
go
the
rule
24
route,
you
get
into
added
complications
because
there
will
be
some
cases
where
they
have
some
special
reason
for
intervening
that
doesn't
go
to
the
settlement
or
something.
i
mean,
it's
just
more
complicated.
and
if
the
courts
have
gotten
along
with
the
simpler
route,
why
not
just
let
sleeping
dogs
lie?
unknown
speaker
that...
that
all
argues
in
favor
that
it's
addedly
complex.
people
get
into
more
arguments
under
than
route.
there
will
be
even
more
delay,
and
the
simplest
thing
is
when
people
who
are
shareholders
really
object
to
the
fairness
of
a
settlement,
let
them
come
in
and
say
so,
and
like
any
other
matter,
let
them
appeal
it
on
that,
not
14
other
issues
that
could
be
created
out
of
rule
24.
now,
that's...
that's
a
very
policy
oriented
argument,
and
it
would
only
apply
if
the...
it's
sort
of
a
wash
in
respect
to
the
language
and
all
the
normal
things.
and
i'm
curious
to
know--
unknown
speaker
--fine.
it's
a...
i'm
interested
in
what
your
answer
is.
unknown
speaker
one
answer
might
be
right
or
wrong.
you
don't
as
a
court
have
that
choice.
the
second
answer
might
be,
well,
even
if
the
language
permits
it
either
way,
et
cetera,
et
cetera,
you're
wrong
as
a
matter
of
policy.
that's
why
i
asked
the
question,
and
i'm
interested
in
what
your
answer
is.
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
you
surely
have
to
say
that's
a
minor
matter
because
the
lawyers
for
the
plaintiffs
are
paid
several
million
dollars
for
doing
that
restructuring.
unknown
speaker
so,
it's
a
pretty
important
issue.
unknown
speaker
otherwise,
you
wouldn't
have
paid
that
kind
of
fees
to
have
it
resolved.
unknown
speaker
mr.
kester,
i
think--
--the
difference
is
that
if
you
appeal
and
you
don't...
if
they
don't
cave
in
on
the
threat,
it's
a
fairly
expensive
party.
unknown
speaker
the
concern
here...
i
mean,
the...
it
was
that
the
modifications
were
they
said
what
the
company
had
already
agreed
to
and
then
there
was
a
little
question
about
there
was
no
money
in
this
for
anybody
except
for
lawyers.
and
that...
i
mean,
that...
that
is
the
concern
in
these
cases,
that
maybe
there
will
be
some
collusion
between
the
lawyers
who
are
settling
and
the
directors
of
the
company.
maybe
that's
the
reason
that
we
require
notice
and
the
notice
is
understood
in
both
rule
23
and
22.1
to
mean
notice
so
you
have
an
opportunity
to
object.
now,
the...
the
argument
here
is
that
these
people
don't
want
to
be
full
parties.
they
don't
want
to
litigate
the
controversy.
they
don't
want
to
get
engaged
in
discovery.
they
just
want
to
object
to
the
settlement.
unknown
speaker
but
we've
been
around
that
bush
because
you
have
conceded
that
they
would
not
be
intervenors
of
right,
and
then
it's
a
discretionary
matter
which
the
district
judge
might
or
might
not
allow.
unknown
speaker
but
then...
then
they
would
be
attacking
not
the
settlement,
but
the
very
maintenance
of
the
suit
because
if
the
representative
is
inadequate,
he
can't
maintain
the
suit.
unknown
speaker
that
would
not
be
an
objection
to
the
settlement,
which
is
what
they
want
to
object
to.
unknown
speaker
well,
that's
why
they
would
not
have
a
right
to
intervene.
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
mr.
kester,
i'm
asking
you
to
be
concrete
about
that
because
we
have
an
actual
case.
unknown
speaker
and
i
put
it
to
mr.
kellogg
and
now
i'm
putting
it
to
you.
unknown
speaker
as
i
read
rule
24,
as
applied
to
this
case,
they
have
no
right
to
intervene.
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
then...
then
we're
back
where
it's
up
to
the
district
judge
who
may
or
may
not--
unknown
speaker
--of
course,
if...
if...
if
we
find...
if
we
find
for
your...
your
opponent
in
this
case,
unless
we
accompany
our
opinion
with...
with
some
statement
to
the
effect
that
the
district
judge
has
to
allow
objections,
the
reaction
on
the
part
of
the
district
courts,
which
up
to
now
have
been
so
liberal
in...
in
allowing
objections
to
be
filed,
could
conceivably
be,
well,
if
allowing
an
objection
is
going
to
allow
all
these
people
to
become
parties,
we're
not
going
to
allow
objections.
i
mean,
if...
if
in
fact,
these...
this
is
not
a
point
against
you.
unknown
speaker
i'm
just
speculating
as
to
whether
that...
that
isn't
a
possible
reaction.
up
to
now,
it's
been
cost
free.
it's
just
like
letting
in
an
amicus,
and
as
a
district
judge,
of
course,
i'd
want
to
hear
every
possible
objection
to
this
settlement
that's...
that's
out
there.
and
up
to
now,
it's
been
cost
free.
i
just
come
in
and
i
listen
to
it.
if
i
don't
like
it,
i
reject
it.
unknown
speaker
you
don't
really
think
that
any
district
judge
would
say,
we're
going
to
spend
a
million
dollars
sending
out
notices
to
all
these
shareholders,
but
we're
not
going
to
let
them
object.
you
don't...
nobody
is
going
to
buy
that
one.
unknown
speaker
i
mean,
you
don't
really
think
that's
going
to
happen.
unknown
speaker
sure.
they're...
of
course,
that's
the
whole
purpose
of
the
notice.
we
could--
unknown
speaker
--well,
they'd
have
to
make...
i
mean,
the
conditions,
the
three
conditions,
that
your
opponent
has
asked
for...
they
have
to
make
a
timely
objection.
they
don't...
they're
not
suggesting
after
a
settlement
has
been
approved
that
somebody
can
come
in
and
make
a
late
objection
and
then
appeal.
unknown
speaker
well,
and
if
you
had
to
appeal
from
a
denial
of
intervention,
the
issue
on
appeal
would
be
whether
it
was
an
abuse
of
discretion
to
deny
intervention,
which
would
be
the
primary
issue,
and
it
wouldn't
be...
the
primary
issue
would
not
be
the
fairness
of
the
settlement.
and
justice
ginsburg's
concern
is
there
should
be
some
or
at
least
the
rules
contemplate,
by
sending
out
a
notice,
that
there
will
be
judicial
review
of
the
settlement.
if
there's
judicial
review,
there
would
also
be
appellate
review.
that
doesn't
necessarily
follow,
i
agree
with
you.
and
i
suppose
your
best
argument
is
that
you
may
have
some
hold-up
situations
where
people
will
threaten
an
appeal
to
get
bought
off.
that's...
all
sorts
of
monkeying
around
in
these
cases
that
i'm
aware
of.
but
i
think
really
you
really
haven't
given
an
effective
answer
to
the
point
that
if
you
don't
allow
an
appeal,
there
is...
it
is...
there
is
no
sure
right
of
review
other
than
on
the
abuse
of
discretion
standard.
unknown
speaker
well,
the
reason
i
suppose
is
that
you
want
to...
do
you
want
to
make
it
easy
for
shareholders,
many
of
whom
are
small
shareholders,
to
file
objections?
and
if
they
must
intervene
in
order...
as
a
predicate
for
filing
an
objection,
you
will
get
fewer
objections
because
it
will
become
much
more
costly.
unknown
speaker
maybe
that's
a
good
reason;
maybe
it
isn't.
but
i'm
sure
that's
the
reason.
unknown
speaker
well,
provision
for
notice
is
in
the
federal
rules.
unknown
speaker
and
the
purpose
of
that
obviously
was
to
allow
shareholders
to
object
to
settlements,
and
the
reason
for
an
appeal
is
that,
everybody
knows,
there
often
large
attorneys'
fees
in
these
cases
which
facilitate
the
settlement.
i've
been
involved
in
some
of
these
cases.
unknown
speaker
it
doesn't
turn
one
into
a
party
with
a
right
to
appeal.
but
i
don't
think
you
even
take
the
position,
even
though
i
recited
the
rule...
i
don't
think
you
take
the
position
that
no
one
can
ever
appeal
unless
he
or
she
is
a
formal
party.
unknown
speaker
you
don't
take
that
position.
unknown
speaker
well,
what
about
the
example
justice
ginsburg
gave?
unknown
speaker
you
said
the...
the
last
class
shareholder
case,
and
you
answered
by
saying,
well,
they
were
bound
by
the
injunction.
unknown
speaker
well,
there's
no
provision
in
the
rules
that
says
everybody
who's
bound
by
an
injunction
may
appeal,
is
there?
unknown
speaker
and
moore
and
wright
and
miller
just,
you
say,
well,
without
any
reasoning
or
whatever,
but
here
are
the
two
leading
treatises
on
procedure
who
say,
as
a
matter
of
course,
an
objector
can
appeal
only
as
to
the
objection,
not
the
whole
case,
but
can
appeal
from
the
approval
of
the
settlement.
period.
now,
those
are
learned
treatises
and
they
both
agree
on
that
position.
unknown
speaker
well,
remember
what
the
seventh
circuit
did.
the
seventh
circuit
was
the
other
way.
then
they
said,
oh,
the
supreme
court
decided
this
case
called
marino
against
ortiz,
and
that
changes
everything.
but
it
didn't
really,
did
it,
because
marino
v.
ortiz
involved
quite
a
different
situation,
people
who
were
not
shareholders...
all
shareholders,
but
people
who
were
genuinely
antagonistic?
white...
was
it
fire
fighters?
i
don't...
police
officers
who
wanted
to
object
to
the
settlement.
they
were
certainly
not
represented
by
the
black
plaintiffs
who
were
suing.
that's
a
very
different
kind
of
case.
unknown
speaker
they
were
outside
the
class.
unknown
speaker
yes,
right.
unknown
speaker
so,
they
had
to
intervene.
they
were
not
class
members,
so
they
had
to
intervene
if
they
wanted
to
be
in
the
show.
but
for
the
seventh
circuit
to
say
it
follows
like
the
night,
the
day,
it
didn't.
whatever...
whatever
the
answer
may
be,
it
doesn't
come
out
of
that
decision.
unknown
speaker
thank
you,
mr.
kester.
unknown
speaker
mr.
kellogg,
you
have
1
minute
remaining.
unknown
speaker
his
point
is
that
the
rules
recognize
that
one,
and
that
they
don't
recognize
this
one.
unknown
speaker
the
honorable
court
is
now
adjourned
until
tomorrow
at
ten
o'clock.
