mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
question
at
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
shareholders
may
appeal
without
formal
intervention
when
a
district
court
approves
a
derivative
suit
settlement
over
their
objections.
we
suggest
that
three
characteristics
combine
in
this
case
to
give
the
objecting
shareholders
such
a
right.
the
first
is
that
they
receive
notice
pursuant
to
rule
23.1
in
the
form
of
an
order
to
show
cause
why
the
settlement
should
not
be
approved.
second,
they
appeared
and
litigated
their
objections.
and
third,
they
are
bound
by
the
judgment
of
the
district
court;
that
is,
they
are
subject
to
claim
preclusion.
when
all
three
of
those
characteristics
are
found,
this
court's
cases
indicate
that
intervention
is
not
required
in
order
to
preserve
a
right
to
appeal.
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
that's
true.
they
did
so
both
in
writing--
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
--not
in
this
case,
although
a
district
court
judge
could
fashion
a
settlement
hearing
in
which
he
would
allow
some
sort
of
discovery
of
the
objecting
parties'
experts
or...
or
some
limited...
i
would
think
that...
that
the
court
would
have
discretion
to
do
that
in
appropriate
circumstances.
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
that's
correct.
but
what
this
court's
cases
teach,
starting
with
johnson
v.
manhattan
railway,
is
that
in
appropriate
circumstances
where
you
do
appear
and
object
and
you
have
a
right
to
do
so
and
you
are
bound
by
the
judgment,
that
you
are
entitled
to
appeal.
that
was
the
holding
of
this
court
shortly
before
the
federal
rules
were
passed.
it
was
the
holding
in
cohen
v.
young
shortly
after
the
federal
rules
were
passed,
and
it
has
been
the
uniform
holding
of
the
courts
of
appeals
until
the
seventh
circuit's
decision
in
this
case.
now,
the
basic
impulse
behind
that
is
the
well-established
principle
that
only
parties
may
be
bound
by
a
judgment.
now,
obviously
there's
an
exception
to
that
rule
for
class...
class
plaintiffs
and
derivative
suit
shareholders.
but
the
only
reason
there
is
an
exception
is
because
non-named
shareholders
and
absent
class
members
are
in
a
sense
quasi
parties.
they
are
treated
as
such
under
the
federal
rules.
that
is
why
they
get
notice.
that
is
why
they
have
a
right
to
appear
and
object,
and
that
is
why
in
our
view
they
also
enjoy
the
right
to
appeal.
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
well,
quasi
party
means
they
are
not
a
formal
party
in
the
sense
of
names
on
the
caption
or
allowed
to
intervene
pursuant
to
rule
24.
but
this
court's
cases
in
blossom
v.
milwaukee
railroad
and
williams
v.
morgan
have
used
the
term
quasi
parties
to
indicate
somebody,
in
those
instances
generally
a
bondholder
objecting
to
a
receivership...
to
indicate
somebody
who
had
a
right
to
appear
before
the
court
and
was
bound
by
the
judgment,
and
therefore
was...
was
viewed
as
having
a
right
to
appeal.
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
it
has
happened.
it
has
been
allowed
in
some
cases,
though
it's
not
clear
quite
how
that
meshes
with
the
language
of
rule
24
because
rule
24
does
not
distinguish
between
intervening
for
some
purposes
and
intervening
for
others.
in
fact,
rule
24
and
rule
23.1
do
not
mesh
particularly
well
together
when
they
are
superimposed
upon
one
another
because,
for
instance,
in
this
case
we
would
be
seeking
to
intervene
as
of
right
because
our
rights
are
are
going
to
be
adjudicated
in
this
particular
instance.
and
yet,
in
order
to
intervene
as
of
right
under
24(a),
you
must
show
that
you
are
not
adequately
represented
by
existing
parties.
yet,
under
23.1,
the
district
court
has
already
made
a
finding
that
you
are
adequately
represented
by
the
existing
derivative
suit
plaintiff.
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
not
in
those
circumstances
because
two
of
the
factors
that
i've
cited
would
not
be
present.
they
did
not
receive
notice
pursuant
to
rule
23.1
and
they
did
not
appear
and
object.
it's
quite
clear
from
this--
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
--if
they
sought
to
participate--
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
--well,
it's
not
clear
then--
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
--how
would
they--
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
--that
would...
that
would
be
my
point.
you
can't
appear
and
object
if
there's
a
litigated
judgment
except
as
a
party,
except
somebody
who
is...
who
is
litigating
the
case.
it's
only
if
there's
a
settlement
that
you
reach
the
circumstance
in
which
somebody
would
appear
and
object
to
the
entry
of
the
settlement,
as
rule
23.1
specifically
provides.
this
court's
case
in
phillips
petroleum
v.
shutts
indicated
that
where
you're
going
to
be
bound
by
the
judgment,
that
you
do
have
certain
rights
in
a
settlement
context
to
appear,
to
object,
and
to
appeal.
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
well,
in
fact,
rule--
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
--well,
in
fact,
justice
scalia,
i
think
allowing
objecting
shareholders
to
appeal
dovetails
very
nicely
with
the
clear
legislative
purposes
and
policies
behind
rule
23.1.
the
whole
point
of
allowing
objecting
shareholders
to
appear
and
object
to
a
settlement
is
to
prevent
collusive
settlements
and
to
provide
the
district
court
with
adequate
information
necessary
to
evaluate
the
fairness
and
adequacy
of
the
settlement.
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
that
would
be
correct.
if
they
wanted
to
be
a
party
for
all
purposes,
if
they
wanted
to
be
able
to
litigate
the
case
to
judgment,
they
would
have
to
intervene.
but
again,
i
would
note
that
there
is...
there
is
a
certain
tension
between
rule
24
and
23.1
because
it's
not
clear
what
it
means
if
they
achieve
full
party
status
under
rule
24
because
ordinarily
if
you're
a
party,
you
can
block
settlement
simply
by
declining
to
appeal...
by
declining
to
agree
to
the
settlement.
but
in
this
context,
that's
not
the
case.
you
cannot
have
an
opt-out
provision
where
some
class
members,
for
example,
go
on
to
pursue...
the
classes
split
apart
and
some
class
members
go
on
to
pursue
or
a
separate
tortfeasor
goes
on
to
pursue
his
case.
there
can
only
be
one
judgment
in
a
derivative
suit
settlement,
just
like
in
a
class
action
under
(b)(1)
or
(b)(2)
where
there
is
no
opt-out.
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
i...
i
think
the
same
rule
would
apply
in
both
circumstances.
if
anything,
the
derivative
suit
context
is
stronger
because
there
is
no
opt-out
provision.
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
that's--
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
--a
point
to
the
contrary.
in
the
derivative
suit
context,
for
example,
there
have
only
been
25
appeals
in
the
last
25
years.
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
in
the
class
action
context,
one
of
the
amici,
public
citizens,
put
in
information
showing
that
90
percent
of
class
actions
settle
without
objection,
which
means
you're
not
going
to
run
into
a
problem.
we
have
found
no
case
in
the
court
of
appeals
saying
that
we
need
protection
from
an
onslaught
of
suits
in
this
case.
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
with
respect
to
class
actions,
we
cite
the
relevant
cases
in
footnote
11
of
page
1
of
our
reply
brief.
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
well,
no.
i
would
suggest
that
in
the
23.1
context,
all
the
absent
shareholders
are
equally
parties
in
the
same
sense
that
absent
class
members
are
parties
in
the
crucial
sense
that
they
will
be
bound
by
the
judgment
of
the
court
and
any
future
claims
they
have
arising
out
of
the
same
circumstances
will
be
precluded.
if
you
look
at
the
language
of
23
and
23.1,
they're
quite
parallel
in
terms
of
the
rights
afforded
to
absent
shareholders.
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
well,
i
think
they're
bound
in
precisely...
precisely
that
sense,
justice
kennedy,
in
the
sense
that
they
are
precluded
then
from
bringing
a
derivative
suit
claim
arising
out
of
the
same
circumstances,
just
as
a
class
member
would
be
precluded
from
bringing
a...
a
subsequent
suit
unless
the
class
member
elects
to
opt
out.
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
before
lunch,
both
justice
ginsburg
and
justice
kennedy
expressed
some
concerns
about
whether
a
derivative
right,
the
rights
of
a
derivative
shareholder,
are
sufficiently
personal,
sufficiently
significant
to
fall
comfortably
within
the
court's
line
of
cases
allowing
non-parties
to
appeal.
and
i
think
that
really
goes
to
the
crux
of
our
argument,
so
i
wanted
to
address
that
briefly.
in
hawes
v.
oakland,
when
the
court
first
laid
down
the
principles
for
derivative
suit
settlements,
the
court
explained
that
there
are
really
two
suits
involved.
one,
there's
a
suit
by
the
shareholder
against
his
corporation
for
essentially
having
fallen
down
on
the
job.
and
second,
there's
the
suit
by
the
shareholder
in
the
guise
of
the
corporation
against
a
third
party
who
has
wronged
the
corporation.
and
in
that
sense,
in
that
important
sense,
the
right
to
bring
a
derivative
action
in
appropriate
circumstances
is
a
critical
part
of
the
bundle
of
rights
that
a
shareholder
possesses,
and
that
common
law
right
has
been
reinforced
by
the
protections
provided
in
rule
23.1,
specifically
notice
and
opportunity
to
appear
and
object
and
the
claim
preclusion
principles
that
have
been
developed
by
the
court.
now,
it's
also
important
to
recognize
that
allowing
objecting
shareholders
to
appeal
serves,
as
i
noted
before
lunch,
the
critical
purposes
underlying
rule
23.1
of
casting
light
on
potentially
collusive
settlements.
and
court
after
court
has
emphasized
the
importance
of
objecting
shareholders
to
give
a
sort
of
adversarial
context
to
what
otherwise
is
a
rather
cozy
deal
cut
between
the
nominal
plaintiff
and
their
lawyers
and
the
corporation.
and
there
are
enormous
practical
disincentives
that
will
be
created
if
shareholders
have
to
go
through
the
hoops
of
intervention
in
order
to
bring
those
objections
to
the
notice
of
the
courts
because
they'll
be
subject
to
mandatory
disclosure
and
discovery
obligations
which
could
be
used
as
a
weapon
to
discourage
objecting
shareholders
and
increase
their
costs.
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
that's
exactly
right,
and
i
don't
see
how
those
two
provisions
mesh
very
well
together.
if
you're
going
to
say
that
you
have
to
intervene
in
order
to
appeal,
you
essentially
have
to
displace
the
existing
shareholders,
and
in
this
case--
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
--right.
in
a
sense,
in
order
to
object
to
the
settlement,
we'd
have
to
displace
the
existing
plaintiffs.
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
well,
i
think--
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
--i
think
my
point
is
that
23.1
gives
us
an
absolute
right
to
come
in
and
object
without
intervening
to
a
proposed
settlement,
and
there's
no
reason
why
we
should
not
have
an
equivalent
right
on
appeal
to
object
to
the
settlement
if
our
objections
are
rejected
by
the
district
court.
we
shouldn't
have
to
go
through
the
burden
of
showing
that
the
existing
plaintiff
is
inadequate
in
order
to
challenge
the
adequacy
of
the
settlement.
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
well,
i
think
you
have
to
distinguish
between
the
inadequacy
of
the
existing
plaintiffs
and
the
inadequacy
of
the
proposed
settlement.
here
we
were
only
challenging
the
adequacy
of
the
proposed
settlement,
as
rule
23.1
gives
us
the
right
to
do.
i'd
like
to
reserve--
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
--you
know,
that...
that
could
in
some
instances
be
a
pretty
fair
inference
that
a
collusive
settlement
indicates--
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
--that
they're
not
adequate
representatives.
but
it
could
also
indicate
that
they've
just
made
a
bad
deal,
and
we
as
shareholders
have
a
right
to
object
to
that.
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
well,
i
think
that's
a...
that's
a
very
interesting
question
and...
and
we're
not
suggesting
that
here
because
we
were
contemporaneous
owners,
and
therefore,
we
would
have
had
a
right
to
be
original
plaintiffs.
i
think
the
third
prong
of
our
argument,
the
claim
preclusion
prong,
doesn't
really
apply
if
you
were
not
a
contemporaneous
owner
of
the
shares
because
you
did
not
have
a
right
to
bring
the
derivative
suit
in
the
first
place.
but
we
were
contemporaneous
owners
and
we
did
have
such
a
right.
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
the
right
to
object?
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
well,
we...
rule
23.1
in
its
terms
provides
a
right
to
notice.
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
the
right
to
notice
would
be
meaningless
if
it
did
not
include
a
right
to
show
up
and
be
heard
on
the
objections
and--
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
--well,
the
uniform
decisions
of
the
courts
indicate
that
we
have
a
right
to
object
to
the
settlement
without
intervening,
without
going
through
the
additional
hoops.
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
i--
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
--well,
in...
in
fact,
no
one
has
disputed,
not
respondents,
not
the
seventh
circuit,
no
one
has
disputed
that
we
have
a
right
to
come
in
and
object--
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
--without
intervening,
and
for
the
reasons
i
gave,
rule
24
doesn't
really
fit
with
rule
23.
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
thank
you.
i'll
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time.
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
mr.
kester
cited
rule
71
of
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure.
i
think
it's
quite
instructive
because
it
particularly
refers
to
the
rights
of
persons
not
parties
to
the
case.
it
makes
no
mention
of
appeal,
and
yet
this
court's
cases
make
clear
that
such
parties
bound
by
an
injunction
do
have
a
right
to
appeal,
just
like
witnesses
held
in
contempt,
just
like
persons
who
are
denied
a
right
to
intervene
are
allowed--
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
--but
they
do
recognize
explicitly
the
rights
of
derivative
shareholders,
and
i'd
like
to
quote
from
rule
23.1.
it's...
it's
at
8a
of
the
addendum
to
our
brief.
it
specifically
says
that
the
plaintiff
in
such
an
action
must
fairly
and
adequately
represent
the
interests
of
the
shareholders.
it
doesn't
refer
to
the
interests
of
the
corporation.
it
say
the
interests
of
the
shareholders.
and
when
a
derivative
suit
is
settled,
particularly
in
a
bogus
way
as
this
one
was
where
most
of
the
money
ends
up
going
to
the
lawyers,
our
rights
as
shareholders
are
bound.
we
are
forever
stuck
with
that
settlement,
with
the
bogus
corporate
reforms
that
they
implemented
and
with
the
large
award
of
attorneys'
fees.
our
rights
are
extinguished
when
that
settlement
is
entered,
and
that
fact
and
the
fact
that
we
appealed
to
object
puts
us
within
a
long
line
of
well-recognized
exceptions
to
the
general
rule
that
only
parties
may
appeal.
thank
you.
