mr.
john
g.
kester
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
government
has
just
completed
an
oral
argument
in
this
case.
the
government
also
filed
a
motion
and
a
brief
in
this
case.
in
fact,
there
is
a
rule
of
this
court
that
allows
the
government
to
file
such
briefs
whenever
it
chooses
to
do
so.
but
the
government
is
not
a
party
in
this
case,
and
if
this
court
were
to
render
a
judgment
with
which
the
government
was
dissatisfied,
the
government
could
not
petition
for
rehearing,
nor
would
it
have
any
responsibility
for
costs
in
this
case.
the
government
is
not
and
the
government
has
never
sought
to
be
a
party
in
this
case.
it's
an
amicus
curiae,
someone
who
is
allowed
to
come
in
and
be
heard,
but
someone
who
does
not
bear
any
of
these
rights
or
responsibilities
of
a
party.
mr.
john
g.
kester
i'm
sorry?
mr.
john
g.
kester
yes.
mr.
john
g.
kester
that's
correct.
mr.
john
g.
kester
they're
not
bound
by
the
judgment
either,
and
neither
in
any
meaningful
sense
were
calpers
and
fsba...
i'll
just
refer
to
them
as
calpers...
who
came
into
the
court
of
appeals
in
analytically
essentially
the
same
position
as
the
government
here.
mr.
john
g.
kester
i'm
saying
that
they
have
no
rights
of
their
own
that
are
affected
by
that
judgment.
it's
been--
mr.
john
g.
kester
--they
own
stock,
but
they
are
not
suing
in
their
own
right.
the
only
action
here
is
brought
on
behalf
of
the
corporation.
how
does
a
derivative
action
begin?
it
begins...
first,
the
shareholder
has
to
go
to
the
management
of
the
corporation
and
say,
this
corporation
has
a
cause
of
action
against
x,
usually
the
directors.
and
then
if
the
corporation
says,
we
don't
care
to
pursue
that
cause
of
action,
or
if
it's
futile
to
ask
them
to
do
so,
then
the
shareholders
can
say,
all
right,
we
are
to
that
extent
going
to
displace
the
management
of
the
corporation
and
we're
going
to
bring--
mr.
john
g.
kester
--they
have
to...
they
have
to
show
they
made
a
demand
and
that
the
board
refused
to
act
on
it.
that's
all
they
have
to
show
at
that
point,
and
then
they...
they
have
to
show
that
they
are
fair
and
adequate
representatives
to
bring
that
action.
now,
if
the
action
goes
along
and
it's
concluded,
there
is
preclusion
of
the
corporation
from
suing
those
same
defendants
again
on
that
cause
of
action.
and
counsel
for
the
government
quoted
from
the
notice
here.
i
have
no
problem
with
the
quote...
the
quote
from
the
notice
because
it
says
that
they'll
be
barred
from
contesting
or
pursuing
the
settled
derivative
claims.
mr.
john
g.
kester
that's
right.
mr.
john
g.
kester
that's
right.
and...
and
i
believe...
i
believe
it
was
suggested,
justice
kennedy,
that...
that
somehow
this
would
keep
shareholders,
individual
shareholders,
from
suing
if
they
had
an
injury,
but
that's
not
true.
shareholders
sometimes
bring
actions
in
their
own
rights,
often
class
actions--
mr.
john
g.
kester
--no,
i
can't...
i
would
not
agree
with
that,
justice
stevens.
in
the
first
place,
we've
talked
about
empirical
data
in
this
case,
of
which...
of
which
there
really
isn't
any.
but
what
the
effect
is--
mr.
john
g.
kester
--but
if
a...
if
a
shareholder
says,
you
directors
defaulted
in
your
duties,
you
did
bad
things,
you
failed
to
do
the
things
you
were
bound
to
be,
then
that
shareholder...
and
he
says,
as
a
result,
the
value
of
my
stock
dropped,
that's
a
suit
on
behalf
of
the
individual
shareholder.
mr.
john
g.
kester
that
is
not
a--
mr.
john
g.
kester
--the
interest...
no.
the--
mr.
john
g.
kester
--i'm...
i'm...
with
all
respect,
in
a
derivative
suit,
the
only
interest
being
litigated
is
the
interest
of
the
corporation,
which
may
or
may
not
have
an
effect
on
the
value
of--
mr.
john
g.
kester
--it's
because
he
is
one
of
the
owners
of
the
corporation.
mr.
john
g.
kester
and...
and
presumably
the
value
of
his
interest
in
the
corporation
to
that
extent
gives
him,
according
to
rule
23.1,
enough
basis
to
come
in
and
say
we're
going
to
displace--
mr.
john
g.
kester
--right.
all
the
shareholders--
mr.
john
g.
kester
--standing.
sure.
mr.
john
g.
kester
sure.
mr.
john
g.
kester
i...
i
think...
i
think
that
possibility,
although
it's
not
a
certainty--
mr.
john
g.
kester
--under
article
3,
i
agree.
mr.
john
g.
kester
that's...
that's...
there's
no
difference
in
the
rights
of
the
particular
shareholders,
except
as
to
their
pro
rata
ownership
of
the
corporation.
now,
i
would
agree
with
that.
but...
but
the--
mr.
john
g.
kester
--which
is
the
sense
that
the
corporation
no
longer
can
bring
that
cause
of
action
against
whoever
is
the
defendant
in
that
case.
mr.
john
g.
kester
if
the...
if
he
claims
an
injury,
but
it
would
be
a
different--
mr.
john
g.
kester
--as...
as
an
individual?
according
to
this
notice,
he
could,
yes.
yes.
if
the
same...
if
the
same
wrongful
acts
affected
the
individual
and
affected
the
corporation--
mr.
john
g.
kester
--he...
he
would
bring...
he
would
bring
the
action
as...
as
someone
who
was
injured
by
wrongful
acts
of
the
directors,
yes,
as
an
individual.
mr.
john
g.
kester
yes.
mr.
john
g.
kester
yes,
that
was--
mr.
john
g.
kester
--this
happens
all
the
time.
mr.
john
g.
kester
right.
this...
there...
when...
when
directors
are
accused
of
malfeasance,
there
often
is
a
derivative
suit
and
there
often
are
individual
suits,
class
action
suits,
by
shareholders.
mr.
john
g.
kester
that's
right.
mr.
john
g.
kester
i
would...
i
would
say
derivative
suits
are
different
from
class
actions.
mr.
kellogg
earlier
said
he
thought
that
the...
if
you
allowed
these
sorts
of
suits
to
be
brought...
if
you
allowed
appeals
to
be
brought
in
a
derivative
action,
you
would
also
be
deciding
that...
that
unnamed
class
members
could
bring
them
too.
and
i
agree
with
that.
however,
your
decision
as
to
derivative
suit
appeals,
if
you
were
to
decide,
as...
as
we
urge,
that
there
is
no
right
of
appeal
here,
you
haven't
necessarily
precluded--
mr.
john
g.
kester
--because...
excuse
me.
mr.
john
g.
kester
again,
they
have
a
somewhat
better
claim
because
a
class
action
member
has
a
particular
individual
claim
against
that
defendant
which
is
being...
which
is
being
precluded.
mr.
john
g.
kester
textually
it's
essentially
the
same...
the
same
words,
justice
souter,
in
rule
23(e)
and
in
the
last
sentence
of
rule
23.1.
and
that...
and
that
brings
us
to
what
i
think
is...
is
the
important
issue
in
this
case
which
has
kind
of
been
glossed
over.
this
suit
doesn't
arise
in
a
vacuum.
this
case
arises
under
the
federal
rules,
and
in
order
for
someone
to
appeal
under
the
federal
rules,
there
either
has
to
be
a
rule
that
converts
an
objector
into
a
party
or
a
rule
that
authorizes
a
non-party
objector
to
appeal.
and
there
is
no
such
rule.
mr.
john
g.
kester
now,
actually,
justice
ginsburg,
in
amchem
the
petitioners
in
this
court
had
been
subjected
to
an
injunction
in
that
case
as
well
as
being
objectors.
so,
they
would
come
within
the
cases
where
someone
is
subjected
to
an
order
of
the
court
and,
of
course,
has
a
right
to
appeal.
that's
noted
in
the...
the
issue
was
not
addressed
in
the...
in
this
court's
opinion,
and
it
wasn't
raised.
but
they
were
actually
subject
to
an...
an
injunction.
also
the
third
circuit,
as
we
know,
is
the
lone
circuit
essentially
out
there
that
takes
the
position
that
calpers
is
arguing
for
here
today.
the
other
circuits
are
very
heavily
the
other
direction.
and,
of
course,
there's
this
court's
decision
in
marino.
i
might
give
you
another
example.
mr.
john
g.
kester
yes.
mr.
john
g.
kester
i...
i
would
believe
that
probably
they
do
have
a
right
to
intervene
under
rule
24(b)
as
a
permissive
intervention.
mr.
john
g.
kester
well,
look...
look
at
the
fibreboard
case
that
the
court
has
before
it
now.
that
came
out
of
the
fifth
circuit.
you
had
a
number
of
class
members
who
went
to
the
fifth
circuit
and
appealed.
some
of
them
were
intervenors
and
some
of
them
were
not
intervenors.
mr.
john
g.
kester
it...
it
might
or
might
not.
i
think
it
would
depend
on
the
judge.
some
judges,
justice
ginsburg,
would
say,
fine,
you...
you
want--
mr.
john
g.
kester
--rule
24
would
allow
permissive
intervention.
if...
and
if
the
district
court
denied
permissive
intervention,
that's
an
appealable
order.
there's
no
question
that
you
can
appeal
a
denial
of
a
motion--
mr.
john
g.
kester
--it
would
be
subject
to
an
abuse
of
discretion
standard,
but
there
would
be
a
record.
there
would
have
been
compliance.
you
see,
the
way
you
convert
an
objector
into
a
party
is
to
intervene.
rule
24
is
there.
and
i
don't
see
this...
this
great
supposed
tension
between
rule
23.1
and
rule
24.
professor
kaplan
said,
who
was
the
author,
the
reporter,
when
the
'66
amendments
were
adopted...
professor
kaplan
said,
the
reason
that
we
notify
people
of
things
is
so
that
they
can
decide
what
to
do,
whether
they
want
to
come
in
and
whether
they
want
to
intervene
and
become
parties.
the
drafters
of
the
rules...
in
1938,
professor
moore;
in
1966,
professor
kaplan...
were
absolutely
crystal
clear
that
a
notice
is
not
a
summons.
and
that's
essentially
the
argument--
mr.
john
g.
kester
--he
could
in
this
case
because
there
was
an
order,
and
this
was
the
point
justice
breyer
made--
mr.
john
g.
kester
--i
think
perhaps
a
district
judge
could...
could
say,
i
will
only
entertain
objections
from
intervenors
because
the
rule...
i
mean,
i
have
to...
i
have
to
say
we
are
construing
the
text
of
the
rule--
mr.
john
g.
kester
--practice.
mr.
john
g.
kester
absolutely.
mr.
john
g.
kester
absolutely,
and
essentially
like
an
amicus
curiae.
that's...
that's
what
it
is.
mr.
john
g.
kester
that's
correct.
mr.
john
g.
kester
well,
in
the
first
place,
the
courts
have
not
gotten
along
with
the
simpler
route.
there...
there
are
about
three
cases.
there's
cohen
against
young,
a
1942
case,
which
has
been
totally
disowned
by
the
sixth
circuit,
and
that
was
a
case
where
there
was
a
motion
to
intervene.
there...
there
is
the
seventh
circuit
case
that
was
overruled
in
this...
in
this
situation,
but
that
was
just
a
footnote
that
relied
on...
on
cohen
v....
with
all...
with
all
respect,
i
don't
think...
i
don't
think
that
was
the
focus
of
that
opinion.
and
then
there's
the
third
circuit
in
that
bell
atlantic
case
which
reads
like...
like
a
policy
discussion.
but
to
go
back
to
what
you
said
at
the
beginning,
justice
breyer,
the
record
would
not
go
up
to
the
court
of
appeals
after
a
motion
to
intervene
in
the
same
way.
i
mean,
rule
24
does
not
just
give
rights
to
would-be
intervenors.
it
gives
rights
to
the
parties
in
a
case
too.
mr.
john
g.
kester
well,
with
all
respect,
it
is...
i
mean,
that
sounds
like
testimony
before
one
of
the
rules
drafting
committees.
mr.
john
g.
kester
right.
mr.
john
g.
kester
i'll
accept...
i'll
accept
both
of
those.
[laughter]
i...
i
would
further
say
it
would...
it
would
come
up
to
the
court
of
appeals
with
a
very
different
record
because,
i
mean,
let's...
let's
just
look
at
this
case.
what
were
the
kinds
of
objections
that
were
being
put
forward
by
calpers
in
this
case?
essentially
they
were
we
don't
like
the
way
this
company's
board
is
structured.
you
know,
we...
you
restructured
it
in
response
to
this
complaint--
mr.
john
g.
kester
--and...
and...
and--
mr.
john
g.
kester
--yes.
mr.
john
g.
kester
it
was
important.
no,
we...
but...
but
the
calpers...
the
calpers
parties
are
coming...
or
non-parties,
i
should
say,
are
coming
in
here
and...
and
they're
saying
we
would...
we
would
like
it
structured
even
differently
from
that,
and
you...
you
get
into
the
perpetual
motion
machine
that
justice
scalia...
you
could.
you
could
get
into
the
perpetual
motion
machine
this
way
because
just
as
people
found
at
some
point
they
could
make
money
off
of
threatening
derivative
suits,
think
of
all
the
money
that
could
be
made
threatening
derivative
appeals.
and--
mr.
john
g.
kester
--right.
but...
but--
mr.
john
g.
kester
--and
they
want
to
then
stop
that
settlement
from
taking
effect
and
hold
it
up
for
a
year,
or
whatever
it
takes,
by
filing
a
notice
of
appeal,
and
they
haven't
done
the
minimal
act
of
going
to
the
district
judge
and
saying,
we
wish
to
intervene.
we
will
assume
the
responsibilities
of
an
intervenor.
that's
what
rule
24
prescribes.
mr.
john
g.
kester
i'm
sorry.
i
didn't
mean
to
say
that...
i
did
not
concede
they
would
not
be
intervenors
of
right
in
all
cases.
i
mean,
it
depends
on
the
situation.
it
depends
on
their
claim.
if
they're
saying
that
the
shareholder
representatives
are
inadequate,
then...
then
they
might
be
able
to
bring
it
under
rule
24(a).
they
might
more
often
bring
it
under
24(b).
mr.
john
g.
kester
that
would...
that
would
be
a
different
sort
of
objection.
here
they're
saying,
we
have
a
better
idea--
mr.
john
g.
kester
--well,
they
would...
i...
it
would
probably
include
an
objection
to
the
settlement
because
they
would
say
it
was
a
settlement
that
was
collusive
or
whatever.
but
here
they
specifically
on
the
record
said,
we
don't
claim
that
there
was
any
impropriety
or
collusion
here
and
the
district
judge
made
a
finding
to
that.
that's
338
and
347
of
the
appendix.
and
instead,
they're
coming
and
they're
saying,
we
have--
mr.
john
g.
kester
--they
have
a
right...
justice
ginsburg,
perhaps...
perhaps
this
is
a
better
way
to
say
it.
they
have
all
the
rights
that
24...
rule
24
provides.
rule
24
provides
in
certain
situations
to
intervene
as
of
right.
in
some
situations--
mr.
john
g.
kester
--i
understand.
mr.
john
g.
kester
okay.
mr.
john
g.
kester
they...
they
waived
any
such
objection.
that's
absolutely
correct.
so,
they...
they
would
intervene,
if
at
all,
under
rule
24(b)
permissively,
and
that
happens...
that
happens
frequently.
mr.
john
g.
kester
who...
who
may...
who
is
subject
to
rule
24(c)
which
provides
certain
parameters
of
when
you
grant
these
and...
and
when
you
don't
and
what
you
look
at.
and...
and
if
a
district
judge
abuses
his
discretion
or
her
discretion,
that's
an
error
of
law
and
that
can
go
up
on
appeal.
and--
mr.
john
g.
kester
--i
understand.
mr.
john
g.
kester
there
were
24...
243,000
notices
went
out
in
this
case.
it's
never
been
explained
because
the
position
of
calpers
in
this
case
is...
is
sort
of
outside
any
text
of
the
federal
rules
and
outside
the
history
of
it.
i
mean,
how
do
you--
mr.
john
g.
kester
--well,
i...
if...
i--
mr.
john
g.
kester
--i...
i...
i...
i
imagine
that
the...
that
the
district
judge
would
entertain
objections.
i
mean--
mr.
john
g.
kester
--but...
but
what...
but
what
happens,
justice
stevens,
after
the
settlement,
after
the
final
judgment
is
entered
and
then
more
people
say,
well,
we...
we
still
object
and
we're
going
to--
mr.
john
g.
kester
--i
see
nothing
in
the...
because
they
don't
tie
this
to
the
federal
rules.
i
don't
see
anything
either
way.
if
you...
once
you
say
the
federal
rules
allows
any
shareholder
to
come
in
and
appeal
if
he
does
not
like
the
judgment
in
the
case...
i
mean,
there
are
post-judgment
interventions
that
occur
all
the
time.
but
what
is...
what
is
being
asked
here
by
the
other
side
is
a
situation
where
if
intervention
were
denied,
it
would
go
up
to
the
court
of
appeals
with
no
record
as
to...
as
to
why
this
intervention--
mr.
john
g.
kester
--there...
there
is
no
sure
right
of
review
if...
if
no
one
intervenes,
but
if
no
one
cares
enough,
justice
stevens,
to
intervene,
why
should
there
be
a
review?
there...
there
is
no--
mr.
john
g.
kester
--and--
mr.
john
g.
kester
--maybe
it
is
and
maybe
it
isn't,
but
it's
not
in
the
federal
rules.
and...
and
on
the
other
hand--
mr.
john
g.
kester
--provision
for
notice.
mr.
john
g.
kester
i'm...
i'm
sure
you
have.
and...
but
there
are
provisions
for
notice.
there
are
even
statutory
provisions
for
notice
throughout
the
code
and...
and
in
the
rules,
and
there
are
all
kinds
of
situations
where
people
get
notice.
but
notice
doesn't
turn
one
into
a
party
with
a
right
to
appeal.
i
mean,
you...
you've
got
the
government's
brief.
it
says,
it's
all
right
here,
but
don't--
mr.
john
g.
kester
--i--
mr.
john
g.
kester
--i
take
the
position
that
they
may
not
unless
authorized
by
the
federal
rules,
and--
mr.
john
g.
kester
--which
one?
mr.
john
g.
kester
yes,
and--
mr.
john
g.
kester
--rule
71
of
the
federal
rules.
there
are
special
rules
on
sureties,
on
summary
proceedings
against
sureties,
rule
65.1.
rule
71
says
if...
if
an
order
gives
you
a
right
or
binds
you,
that
can
be
enforced,
it
says,
as
if
you
were
a
party.
that's
essentially
a
codification
of
these
cases
from
the
19th
century
that
the
government
calls
quasi
party
cases.
it's...
those
are...
those
are
collateral
issues,
and
those
are...
those
are
treated
like
separate
lawsuits.
but
the
rule
said
in
marino...
it's
been
said
for
150
years.
it's
been
enforced...
is
that
you
have
to
be
a
party
to
appeal
or
you
have
to
have,
as
rule
71
does,
a...
an
authorization
to
appeal
as
if
you
were
a
party.
all
of
those
cases,
which
they
say
are
exceptions,
are
not
really
exceptions.
it's
a
clear
principle,
and
it's
been...
it's
not
as
if...
it's
not
as
if
we
were
suggesting
some
kind
of
dramatic
change.
we're
asking
to
continue
to
follow
the
rule
that
most
courts
of
appeals
already
follow
in
both
class
actions
and
derivative
suits
in
well-reasoned
opinions.
there...
that
really
only
the
third
circuit--
mr.
john
g.
kester
--and...
and
i
would
say
that
this
was
a
learned
panel,
and
that...
those
learned
treatises--
mr.
john
g.
kester
--but
they
were
allowed...
they
were
allowed
to
come
in
and...
and
object,
but
they
were
not
allowed
to
appeal.
mr.
john
g.
kester
they
were
not...
they
were
not
members
of
the
class.
mr.
john
g.
kester
no.
mr.
john
g.
kester
but
i...
and
i
would
respectfully
say
it
doesn't
come
out
of
the
treatises
either
because
they
simply
relied
on
the
bell
atlantic
case,
and
professor
moore
originally
took
our
position.
mr.
john
g.
kester
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
