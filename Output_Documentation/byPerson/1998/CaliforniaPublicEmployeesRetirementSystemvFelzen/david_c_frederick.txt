mr.
david
c.
frederick
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
contrary
to
the
court
below,
we
believe
other
courts
have
correctly
decided
that
objecting
shareholders
may
appeal
in
a
derivative
action
without
formally
intervening
because
they
meet
three
conditions.
they
have
a
right
to
participate
in
the
district
court
proceedings
pursuant
to
notice
under
rule
23.1.
they
actually
participate
in
those
proceedings,
and
the
district
court's
entry
of
the
settlement
decree
has
claim-preclusive
consequences
on
their
personal
rights.
those
three
conditions
were
present
in
every
one
of
the
quasi
party
cases
that
we
cite
in
our
brief,
and
if
i
could
direct
the
court's
attention
to
page
22
of
respondents'
brief,
they
have
cited
10
cases
from
this
court
which
state
the
general
rule
that
only
parties
or
their
privies
may
appeal.
in
every
single
one
of
those
cases,
one
of
those
three
conditions
was
absent,
and
the
court
explained
the
general
rule
in
terms
of
the
absence
of
one
of
those
conditions.
and
if
i
could
beg
the
court's
indulgence
for
just
a
moment
to
go
through
those
cases,
six
of
them,
the
court
explained
that
that
particular
moving
entity
did
not
have
a
right
to
be
in
the
district
court
proceedings
or
that
their
rights
were
otherwise
circumscribed
in
a
way
that
they
sought
to
expand
on
appeal.

a
second
category
of
cases,
this
court
explained
that
the
moving
party
had
not
actually
participated
in
the
district
court
proceedings,
but
nonetheless
sought
to
take
an
appeal.
that
explains
the
holding
in
cutting
and
connor
v.
pughs
lessee.
the
third
category
of
cases
is
where
the
court
has
made
clear
or
was
evident
from
the
record
that
the
decision
did
not
have
claim-preclusive
consequences
on
the
party
that
sought
to
take
an
appeal.
that
explains
the
holding
in
bayard
v.
lombard
and
in
marino
v.
ortiz.
so,
it
is
clear
that
in
this
case
about
20
cases
of
this
court
have
been
cited
either
for
the
general
rule
that
only
a
party
may
appeal
or
for
the
well...
well-recognized
exception
that
quasi
parties
can
take
an
appeal
if
those
three
conditions
are
satisfied.
there
is
not
a
single
case
cited
by
any
of
the
respondents
in
this
case
that
where
a
claim
preclusion
applies
to
someone
not
a
formal
party,
that
person
does
not
have
a
right
to
appeal.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
in
fact,
it
is
the
same
chosen
action.
what
this
court
explained
in
phillips
petroleum
v.
shutts
was
that
a
class
member
in
that
context...
also
a
shareholder,
as
it
turned
out,
in
the
case...
had
a
chosen
action
which
was
a
personal
property
right
that
would
be
extinguished
by
the
ultimate
judgment
in
the
case.
it's
no
different
the
fact
that
the
claim
is--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--it's
also
the
directors
and
officers
who
are
the
real
defendants
in
this
case,
justice
kennedy,
cannot
be
sued
derivatively
by
other
shareholders.
and
so,
it's...
the
corporation
here
is
a
nominal
defendant.
in
the
normal
shareholder
derivative
case,
the
plaintiff
shareholders
are
bringing
the
action
ostensibly
on
behalf
of
the
corporation
because
directors
and
officers
have
breached
their
fiduciary
duties
or
committed
other
misdeeds
that
have
caused
a
wrong
to
the
corporation,
and
so
the
corporation
is
simply
a
nominal
defendant.
but
what
is
clear
here
and
what
the
notice
actually
provided
in
the
district
court
proceedings...
and
if
i
could
refer
the
court
to
the
joint
appendix,
page
134
makes
perfectly
clear
that
the
rights
of
the
shareholders
who
are
receiving
this
notice
will
have
their
claims
forever
precluded.
i'm
reading
from
the
all-capped
provision
in
the
second
paragraph,
the
second
sentence
which
reads:
if
the
court
approves
the
derivative
settlement,
you
will
be
barred
from
contesting
the
fairness,
reasonableness
or
adequacy
of
the
proposed
settlement,
and
from
pursuing
the
settled
derivative
claims.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
two
answers.
first,
congress
has
made
clear
that
in
the
antitrust
proceedings,
there
is
a
different
form
of
procedure
for
objections
and
for
intervention.
secondly,
this
court's
decision
in
the
sam
fox
case
makes
clear
that
when...
that
case
is
not
cited
in
the
briefs,
but
it
is
stated
in
the
advisory
committee
notes
to
rule
24
of
the
civil
procedure
rules,
and
it's
a
1960
decision.
but
that
case
holds
that
when
the
government
brings
an
antitrust
enforcement
action,
that
does
not
foreclose
the
rights
of
a
private
party
to
bring
a
claim
based
on
personal
injury
for
same
or
similar
conduct
on
the
part
of
the
defendant.
so,
there
is
a
holding
from
this
case
which
indicates
that
in
the
antitrust
context,
there
is
no
claim
preclusion.
and
if
i
could
just
take
another
moment
to
explain
that
the
enforcement
decrees,
which
we
have
outlined
in
our
brief,
are
fully
suggestive
that
congress
could
change
the
rules
and
has
changed
the
rules
in
the
environment,
the
antitrust
and
the
civil
rights
contexts,
but
it
has
not
changed
those
rules
in
the
shareholder
derivative
context.
and
therefore
the
common
law
rule,
which
would
allow
persons
similarly
situated
to
the
objecting
shareholders
in
this
case
a
right
to
appeal,
if
the
district
court
overrules
their
objections,
should
govern
here
as
well.
now,
i
would
like
to
address
one
last
point
that
justice
scalia
raised
which
was
some
difference
between
why
settlement
would
be
different
from
litigating
to
judgment.
and
the
answer,
justice
scalia,
is
that
settlement
is
quite
different
because
there
is
an
absence
of
an
adversarial
process
when
the
settlement
is
brought
to
the
district
court
for
approval.
and
historically
the
courts
recognized
that
there
was
a
potential
conflict
of
interest
between
the
plaintiff
shareholders
who
might
or
might
not
represent
the
views
of
all
of
the
other
shareholders
as
it
turned
out
for
settlement
and
the
directors
and
officers
and
the
nominal
defendant
corporation
which
would
seek
to
settle
the
claim.
and
that's
why
the
provision
for
court
approval
was
put
into
the
rule
so
that
persons
could
state
their
objections
to
the
adequacy
of
the
settlement.
that's
very
different
from
the
adversarial
process
that,
of
course,
goes
when
the
case
and
the
complaint
go
all
the
way
through
trial
where
the
plaintiff
shareholders
are
contending
that
there
was
some
action
that
required
jury
findings
and
court
rulings
that
would
go
all
the
way
to
judgment.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
that's
correct.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
well,
in
fact,
as
the
empirical
experience
would
strongly
suggest,
justice
scalia,
in
the
uniform
application
of
this
rule
up
until
the
decision
below,
that
was
not
the
experience.
and
in
fact,
the
rule
that...
having
objectors
appeal
and
bring
continuous
and
successive
appeals
is
simply
not
a
problem
that
bears
any
empirical
evidence
whatsoever.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
well,
in
fact--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--no,
justice
scalia,
it
does
not.
i
mean,
the
practical
incentives
for
an
objector
are
just
simply
not
present
for
continuing
to
repeat
objections
that
go
to
a
settlement.
but
even
if
there
was
some
problem
like
that,
that
certainly
could
be
addressed
by
some
type
of
an
amendment
to
the
rules
if
in
the
future
there
becomes
some
problem,
and
it
just
simply
has
not
evidenced
itself
up
to
now.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
that's
correct,
justice
stevens.
now,
one
last
point
i
would
like
to
make,
which
is
that
the
court
of
appeals
seemed
to
confuse
what
the
proper
standard
for
approving
a
settlement
is.
and
if
i
could
direct
the
court's
attention
to
page
6a
of
the
petition
appendix,
the
court...
the
court
stated
there
that
rule
23.1
provides
notice
to
shareholders
only
in
the
event
of
dismissal
or
settlement
so
that
other
investors
may
contest
the
faithfulness
or
honesty
of
the
self-appointed
plaintiffs.
our
concern,
from
the
perspective
of
the
federal
government's
interest,
is
that
that
error
gravely
misstated
what
the
standard
is
for
approving
a
settlement
and
that
if
that
standard
is
applied,
it
really
will
confuse
the
distinctions
between
rule
23.1
and
24
in
a
way
that
would
make
very
difficult
for
the
adequacy
of
settlements
that
are
simply
based
on
their
economic
terms.
