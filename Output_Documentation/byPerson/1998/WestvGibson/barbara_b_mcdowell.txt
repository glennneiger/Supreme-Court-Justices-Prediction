ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
equal
employment
opportunity
commission
has
the
authority
to
award
compensatory
damages
in
the
administrative
process
to
redress
violations
of
title
vii
by
agencies
of
the
federal
government.
that
authority
is
conferred
by
two
provisions
of
title
42
read
together.
the
first
is
section
2000e-16,
which
authorizes
the
eeoc
to
award
appropriate
remedies
in
the
administrative
process
against
federal
agencies
that
violate
title
vii.
the
second
is
section
1981a,
which
authorizes
awards
of
compensatory
damages
in
title
vii
actions
against
the
federal
government.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
no,
it
doesn't,
mr.
chief
justice,
but
we
believe
that
the
two
sections,
read
together,
provide
the
eeoc
with
that
authority.
essentially,
by
waiving
the
government's
sovereign
immunity
with
respect
to
compensatory
damages,
that
made
compensatory
damages
also
an
appropriate
remedy
that
may
be
awarded
in
the
administrative
process
by--
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
--yes,
they
do.
agencies
themselves
award
it,
and
the
eeoc
on
appeal
also
awards
them
in
the
administrative
process.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
if
an
employee
or
applicant
for
employment
is
dissatisfied
with
the
award
that's
made
at
the
administrative
level,
he
can
bring
an
action
de
novo
in
district
court.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
the
agency
does
not,
though.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
there
are
other
statutory
schemes
that
are
somewhat
similar.
for
example,
the
federal
employees
compensation
act,
which
compensates
employees
who
are
injured
and
killed
on
the
job,
doesn't
have
a
judicial
review
mechanism.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
essentially,
yes,
your
honor,
that
congress
made
that
determination
in
1972
when
it
provided
that
only
employees
and
applicants
for
employment
can
challenge
eeoc
awards.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
that's
correct,
your
honor,
but
there
were
back
pay
awards
and
other
sorts
of
awards,
including
reinstatement,
promotion
and
so
on,
that
in
many
senses
are
more
intrusive
to
agencies
than
compensatory
damages.
presently,
of
course,
back
pay
and
compensatory
damages
are
both
available
in
the
administrative
process
and
the
back
pay
awards
exceed
the
compensatory
damages
award
by
a
factor
of
at
least
three.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
that's
correct,
your
honor.
the
court
of
appeals
construed
section
1981a
as
limiting
the
government's
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity
to
proceedings
in
court
in
which
a
jury
trial
would
be
available.
that
position
is
incorrect
for
at
least
three
reasons.
first,
the
court
of
appeals'
position
is
inconsistent
with
the
administrative
exhaustion
requirement
of
section
2000e-16(c),
which
is
a
condition
on
the
government's
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity
under
title
vii.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
yes,
your
honor--
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
--he
may.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
yes,
your
honor.
the
eeoc
is
an
optional
choice,
although
it
certainly
is
a
choice
that
is
made
by
most
employees
in
the
process.
for
example,
in
fiscal
1997
approximately
1,000
cases
were
filed
by
employees
in
court.
approximately
7,00
appeals
to
the
eeoc
were
taken.
that
suggests
that
the
eeoc
is
a
desirable
route
for
a
large
number
of
employees.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
it
might
have
made
sense,
but
congress
did
not
say
that.
congress
didn't
disturb
the
administrative
exhaustion
requirement,
which
had
always
been
understood
to
enable
an
employee
or
applicant
to
obtain
full
relief
in
the
administrative
process.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
it
would
be
our
position
in
that
situation
that
he
would
forfeit
that
by
not
asking
for
them
at
the
agency
level
as
well.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
i
believe
that's
correct,
your
honor,
at
least
a
large
number
of
them
are
not.
that's
not
to
suggest,
however,
that
most
of
them
aren't
asking
for
compensatory
damages.
indeed,
they
are.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
there's
no
requirement
that
an
employee
be
specifically
advised
of
what
sort
of
remedies
he
can
receive.
however,
the
eeoc
does
have
procedures
that
agencies
are
required
to
follow,
that
if
an
employee
says
anything
to
indicate
that
he
has
suffered
compensatory
damages,
if
he
mentions
emotional
distress,
for
example,
if
he
mentions
that
he's
seen
a
doctor,
the
agency
is
supposed
to
make
further
inquiry
to
see
whether
a
compensatory
damages
claim
is
indeed
appropriate
in
that
case.
the
agency
and
the
eeoc
are
not
allowed
to
rely
on
an
employee's
failure
to
use
particular
magic
words
to
request
compensatory
damages.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
well,
presumably
the
employee,
if
he
has
made
a
claim
for
compensatory
damages,
bears
the
burden
of
proof,
and
the
eeoc
has
held
this,
of
establishing
both
the
amount
and
the
nexus
to
the
alleged
discrimination.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
well,
the
second
step,
actually
the
administrative
process
is
the
filing
of
a
formal
complaint
at
the
agency
level
and
that
typically,
as
in
this
case,
asks
the
employee
what
relief
are
you
asking
for,
and
in
this
case
mr.
gibson
requested
back
pay.
he
didn't
request
compensatory
damages.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
that's...
the
view
that
the
eeoc
has
taken
is
that
he
doesn't
necessarily
have
to
request
them
in
his
complaint
or
in
particular
words--
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
--but
he
does
have
to
identify
the
need
for
compensatory
damages
at
some
point.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
well,
typically
that
is
why
it's
our
position
that
the
employee
does
need
to
waive
the
compensatory
damages
claim
if
the--
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
--no,
certainly
he
does.
he
doesn't
have
to
say
compensatory
damages
in
so
many
words,
or
he
doesn't
necessarily
have
to
say
compensatory
damages
in
his
complaint,
but
at
some
point
in
the
administrative
process
he
certainly
does
have
to
put
the
agency
on
notice.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
well,
then
there
would
have
to
be
an
investigation
to
determine
the
amount
of
his
claim
and
whether
it
is
connected
with
the
alleged
discrimination,
so
at
some
point
there
would
be
a
fact-finding
process.
in
many
of
these
cases
there's
actually
an
administrative
hearing
before
an
eeoc
administrative
judge
at
the
agency
level,
and
at
that
point,
at
times
the
evidence
that's
taken
on
compensatory
damages
claims
can
be
quite
extensive,
including
reports
from
competing
psychiatrists,
and
so
on.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
the
eeoc
has
held
that
it's
appropriate
when
an
employee
indicates
that
he
suffered
that
kind
of
damage
to
make
further
inquiry
to
see
if
what
he
is
really
seeking
are
compensatory
damages--
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
--that's
correct,
yes.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
and
there's
a--
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
--yes,
although
the
eeoc
has
said
that
in
some
instances
he
may
defer
raising
the
claim
if
he's
not
aware
of
it
until
he
gets
to
the
eeoc
level,
the
second
level.
in
that
case,
if
he
raises
it
first
before
the
eeoc,
the
typical
procedure
is
for
it
to
be
remanded.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
yes.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
yes,
he
does,
it
does,
and--
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
--the
eeoc
has
felt
that--
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
--yes,
and
that's
the
very
initial
phase
of
the
whole
eeo
process,
is
informal
counseling,
and
this
is
an
effort
to
try
to
resolve
these
complaints
before
a
formal
complaint
is
filed.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
yes.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
yes,
that
is
a
counselor
of
that
agency,
yes.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
that's
correct,
and
as
a
practical
matter
there
are
different
people
performing
these
different
functions
within
the
agency.
the
eeo
counselors
are
supposed
to
be
independent
of
those
who
are
making
the
determination
on
the
merits
of
a
claim
when
it
comes
to
that.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
we're
not
arguing
that
the
agency
has
the
discretion
to
determine--
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
--we
don't
perceive
that
we
were
making
precisely
that
argument,
your
honor.
it's
our
position
that
there
does
need
to
be
a
clear
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity,
and
that
was
made
here
in
section
1981,
that
the
question
of
appropriate
remedies
by
leaving
this
broad
language
in
the
statute
enabled
the
eeoc
to
determine--
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
--not
that
we're
aware
of,
your
honor,
no.
returning
to
the
administrative
exhaustion
requirement
of
section
2000e-16,
that
requirement
has
always
been
understood
to
provide
a
mechanism
for
full
relief
in
the
administrative
process
to
enable
employees
and
agencies
not
to
have
to
go
to
court
to
litigate
these
issues.
it
would
be
inconsistent
with
that
statutory
design
to
require
an
employee
who
still,
everybody
agrees,
must
go
to
the
administrative
level
to
exhaust
his
claims
of
liability
and
equitable
relief,
then
to
have
to
go
to
the
district
court
to
seek
compensatory
damages.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
yes,
your
honor.
the
employee
would
still
be
required
to
have
raised
his
claim
for
compensatory
damages
at
the
agency
level.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
there's
an
obligation
to
advise
about
rights,
but
there's
no
requirement
to
advise
about
what
remedies
he
should
be
requesting
in
the
administrative
process,
so
yes,
we
would
say
that
his
failure
to
exhaust
administrative
remedies
by
not
requesting
compensatory
damages
from
the
agency
would
require
the
dismissal
of
his
claim.
that
wouldn't
necessarily
mean
that
his
claim
would
have
to
be
dismissed
with
prejudice,
however.
it's
our
position
that
the
exhaustion
requirement
itself
is
jurisdictional
to
the
extent
that
the
issue
must
be
raised
before
the
agency,
but
the
time
limits
for
exhaustion
are
not,
so
in
cases
where
justice
might
require,
the
district
court
could
dismiss
a
case
without
prejudice
to
enable
the
employee
to
try
to
go
back
to
his
agency
and
exhaust
the
remedies
that
he
failed
to
exhaust
before.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
well,
in
many
circumstances,
your
honor,
somebody
who
is
seeking
relief
from
the
government
is
required
to
inform
himself
or
herself
of
what
the
statutory
remedies
provide.
certainly
in
this
case--
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
--well,
as
we
say,
it
wouldn't
entirely
preclude
an
employee
who
could
establish
once
he
went
to
court
that
he
had
a
good
reason
for
not
having
raised
the
claim
before.
it's
our
understanding
that
most
employees
are
quite
well-informed
of
their
ability
to
obtain
compensatory
damages.
currently,
i
understand,
of
those
cases
that
are
appealed
to
the
eeoc
in
which
compensatory
damages
are
theoretically
available
because
they're
under
title
vii
of
the
rehabilitation
act
that
in
excess
of
80
percent
involve
requests
for
compensatory
damages,
so
i
don't
think
the
situation
you
posit
of
employees
being
uninformed
of
his
rights--
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
--well,
as
i
indicated
previously,
once
an
employee
puts
the
agency
on
notice
that
he
suffered
emotional
loss,
medical
expenses,
something
of
that
nature,
then
the
agency
is
supposed
to
make
inquiry,
but
as
a
general
matter
in
every
case
across
the
board
there's
no
instruction
from
the
eeoc
that
employees
have
to
advise...
employers
have
to
advise
employees
of
any
particular
remedies
that
are
available
to
them,
whether
it's
back
pay
or
a
statement
of
compensatory--
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
--that's
correct,
yes.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
no.
in
80
percent
of
those
cases
there's
a
claim
for
compensatory
damages,
which
suggests
simply
that
employees
are
aware
of--
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
--that's
the
80
percent.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
yes.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
yes,
it
does.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
they're
reported
on
west
law.
they're
reported
through
other
mechanisms
as
well.
they're
not
reported
in
a
volume
like
f
supp.
though.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
i'm
not
aware
of
any
actual
cases
in
which
that
happened.
however,
theoretically
that's
a
possibility--
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
--because
an
employee
if
dissatisfied
can
go
to
court.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
i'm
not
aware
of
that
at
this
point,
no.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
most
are.
there
were
approximately
26,500
cases
resolved
at
the
agency
level
in
fiscal
'97
as
opposed
to
7,000
cases
that
were
appealed,
so
one
would
think
a
lot
of
cases
are
going
away
at
the
agency
level.
about
a
quarter
of
the
cases
are
settled
at
the
agency
level
for
relief
that
could
include
compensatory
damages.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
our
position
is
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
however,
the
eleventh
circuit
has
held
otherwise.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
the
statutory
authority
would
be
the
same
as
the
authority
that
applies
to
the
eeoc
itself.
there's
further
authority
in
section
2000e-16
saying
that
the
agencies
are
those
who
have
the
primary
responsibility
in
the
federal
government
of
enforcing
equal
employment
opportunity.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
no.
there's
nothing
about
the
agency
itself
awarding
appropriate
relief,
although
there
is
authorization,
of
course,
to
the
eeoc
to
award
appropriate
remedies
and
for
the
eeoc
also
to
promulgate
rules
and
regulations.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
no,
it
doesn't.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
that's
correct,
and
that's
why
it's
generally
our
position
that
one
must
raise
it
at
the
agency
level.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
there
are
those--
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
--well,
there's
one
other
point,
justice
scalia,
and
that
is
that
everybody
agrees
that
an
agency
can
settle
a
claim
for
an
amount
that
includes
compensatory
damages.
the
general
rule
there
is
that
an
agency
can
settle
a
claim
for
any
sorts
of
damages
that
could
be
awarded
ultimately
in
court,
and
so
many
of
these
cases
in
which
compensatory
damages
as
actually
are
paid
over
at
the
agency
level
involve
settlements--
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
--so
there's
a
reason
to
exhaust
just
for
that
purpose.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
that's
correct,
and
if
the
court
decided
the
case
in
a
manner
that
precluded
the
agencies
from
awarding
it
as
well.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
yes.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
no.
the
agency
conducts
an
investigation
and
ultimately
issues
a
decision
on
the
merits
if
the
case
hasn't
previously
been
settled
or
dismissed
on
procedural
grounds.
the
employee
can
request
a
hearing
as
well
before
an
administrative
judge
of
the
eeoc.
that
is
requested
in
a
third
to
a
half
of
all
cases.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
yes.
it's
not
a
large
number
of
cases,
but
there
are
some.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
we
think
that
the
most
appropriate
construction
of
the
jury
trial
provision
as
applied
to
federal
employee
cases
is
that
if,
indeed,
a
case
reaches
district
court
because
the
employee
was
not
satisfied
with
either
the
administrative
agency's
award
or
the
eeoc's
award,
then
either
party
can,
indeed,
request
a
jury
trial,
but
this
doesn't
foreclose
the
eeoc
from
doing
it.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
yes.
it's
important
to
know--
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
--pardon
me?
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
no,
not
that
i'm
aware
of.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
that's
correct,
yes.
it's
important
to
recognize
that
the
jury
trial
provision
is
a
general
provision.
it
was
not
directed
specifically
at
the
federal
government.
it's
part
of
a
provision
that
applies
to
all
title
vii
cases
whether
against
the
government
or
against
private
employees.
this
provision
is
already
in
the
legislation
that
became
section
1981a
before
senator
warner
offered
his
amendment
to
extend
compensatory
damages
to
federal
employees
as
well.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
that's
correct,
and
congress
was
certainly
award
of
that
provision
at
the
time
that
it
enacted
section
1981a.
if
it
had
intended
at
that
point
to
limit
the
available
remedies
to
appropriate
equitable
remedies,
presumably
congress
would
have
said
so,
but
it
didn't.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
yes.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
it's
also
important
to
recognize
that
all
of
this
legislation
was
enacted
against
a
historical
background
of
congress'
historical
aversion
to
jury
trials
on
monetary
claims
against
the
government.
certainly
that's
reflected
in
the
tucker
act
and
the
federal
tort
claims
act,
where
a
condition
of
the
government's
waiver--
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
--that's
correct,
so
this
is
a
somewhat
different
provisions
but
in
order
to
jump
from
the
existence
of
this
provision
to
a
condition
on
the
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity
is
a
greater--
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
--yes,
and
that's
a
choice
that
congress
made
back
in
1972,
your
honor.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
well,
congress
decided
otherwise
when
it
determined
that
finality
was
more
important
than
whatever
extra
accuracy
would
be
obtained
by
judicial
proceedings
with
respect
to
equitable
relief,
back
pay
and
so
on,
under
title
vii.
that's--
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
--well,
to
a
certain
extent--
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
--one
could
look
at
it
that
way.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
remainder.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
to
respond
to
justice
breyer's
question--
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
--yes.
it
is
the
government's--
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
--position
that
there
is
a
jury
trial
if
the
case
ripens
into
an
action
into
district
court.
it's
our
position
that
the
jury
in
that
sort
of
case
would
determine
issues
of
liability
as
well
as
issues
of
compensatory
damages,
although
equitable
relief
would
continue
to
be
awarded
by
the
court
following
the
jury's
decision.
in
terms
of
the
question
about
the
historical
practice
of
awarding
compensatory
damages
at
the
administrative
level,
we
don't
have
a
count
on
the
exact
number
of
cases.
however,
in
fiscal
1997,
3.5
million
dollars
worth
of
compensatory
damages
were
awarded
at
the
agency
level.
since
often
these
awards
are
quite--
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
--no,
the
agency
level,
the
initial
level.
since
often
these
rewards
are
really
quite
small,
500
dollars,
1,000
dollars,
2,000
dollars,
that
could
be
a
large
number
of
cases,
but
we
don't
have
a
count
on
that.
if
there
are
no
further
questions
from
the
court--
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
--oh.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
yes.
the
54(c)
talks
about
relief
that
you
have
actually
proven,
and
that's
consistent
with
the
eeoc's
position
here,
that
if
you
have
proven
compensatory
damages
in
the
administrative
process,
yes,
you
can
recover
them,
but
an
agency
and
the
eeoc
shouldn't
be
forced
to
guess
at
what
damages
you
may
have
suffered.
thank
you.
