mr.
timothy
m.
kelly
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i'd
like
to
address
initially
justice
ginsburg's
concerns
about
the
issue
as
to
how
an
employee
goes
about
requesting
compensatory
damages.
i
think
if
you
take
a
look
at
the
appendix,
the
joint
appendix
in
this
case,
at
the
two
fold-out
pages
in
the
center,
i
believe
pages
23
and
24,
you'll
see
the
actual
eeo
form
that
mike
gibson
filled
out
back
in
1992
when
this
case
initially
arose,
and
you'll
see
in
that
form
that
there's
really
no
place
for
an
employee
to
indicate
that
he
wants
compensatory
damages.
the
only
question
that's
asked
on
this
form
relating
to
any
kind
of
remedy
at
all,
it
asks
not
what
injury
you
suffered,
but
what
corrective
action
are
you
seeking.
it's
our
position
that
this
request
for
corrective
action
is
in
direct
lineage
with
the
interpretation
of
the
federal
employee
section
of
title
vii,
which
has
always
held
that
only
equitable
remedies
were
available
for
either
federal
employees
or
private
employees
of
discrimination
until
the
1991
act
was
passed.
mr.
timothy
m.
kelly
and
that's
exactly
our
position
both
in
the
district
court
and
in
the
seventh
circuit
with
respect
to
mike
gibson's
exhausting
his
administrative
remedies
and
the
argument
that
the
government
ought
to
be
estopped
from
raising
the
bar
of
exhaustion
in
this
particular
case,
because
the
facts
are
undisputed
that
mike
gibson
was
never
advised
of
a
right
to
compensatory
damages.
mr.
timothy
m.
kelly
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
timothy
m.
kelly
only
because
that's
how
i
know
him,
judge.
mr.
timothy
m.
kelly
mr.
chief
justice,
and
i
apologize.
mr.
timothy
m.
kelly
well--
mr.
timothy
m.
kelly
--well,
and--
mr.
timothy
m.
kelly
--well,
and
justice
scalia
we
have
argued
all
three
of
those
grounds.
the
seventh
circuit
decided
the
case
on
the
sovereign
immunity
issue,
but
we
have
maintained
the
argument
that
mike
gibson
was
deceived,
and
in
fact
that
mike
gibson--
mr.
timothy
m.
kelly
--you
did
not,
your
honor,
but
the
opinions
of
this
court
indicate
that
it's
the
judgment
that's
reviewed
not
the
reasoning
of
the
court
of
appeals,
and
all
of
the
arguments
that
we've
presented
are
strong
reasons
to
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
if
not
according
to
the
same
reasoning,
and
we
do
agree
with
the
reasoning
of
the
seventh
circuit.
i
point
this
out
because
not
only
did
the
form
draw
mike
gibson
in
a
different
direction,
the
regulations,
the
eeoc
regulations
specifically
require
the
agency
and
the
eeoc
to
advise
mike
gibson
of
his
rights
and
to
oversee
this
instruction
of
pro
se
litigants
through
the
administrative
system,
and
that
was
never
done.
mr.
timothy
m.
kelly
well,
in
that
event,
your
honor,
we
have
argued
also
that
mike
gibson
invoked
the
compensatory
damage
remedy
by
telling
the
investigator
from
the
veterans
administration
that
he
was
seeking
a
monetary
cash
award.
the
eeoc
has
ruled
that
a
request
for
an
appropriate
cash
reward
is
a
request
for
compensatory
damages,
and
for
the
agency
to
take
the
position
that
monetary
cash
award
is
a
request
for
compensatory
damages,
and
appropriate
cash
reward
is
not
a
request,
or
vice
versa,
we
think
is
a
return
to
the
hypertechnical
exhaustion
requirement
that
predates
giving
federal
employees
access
to
the
federal
courts
in
1972.
with
regard
to
the
sovereign
immunity
issue,
we
have
argued
not
only
the
jury
trial
provision
of
section
1981a,
and
i
believe
that
the...
ms.
mcdowell
misreads
section
1981a(c),
because
the
jury
trial
provision
does
not
begin
with,
if
a
case
gets
to
federal
district
court,
then
you
have
a
right
to
trial
by
jury.
it
says,
if
a
complaining
party--
mr.
timothy
m.
kelly
--i'm
reading
from
section
1981a(c).
mr.
timothy
m.
kelly
your
honor,
that's
in
the
appendix
to
the
cert
petition,
page...
that's
page
32a.
mr.
timothy
m.
kelly
the
statute
says,
if
a
complaining
party
seeks
compensatory
or
punitive
damages,
then
either
party
may
demand
a
trial
by
jury.
in
this
case,
it
must
be
conceded
that
a
federal
employee
asking
for
compensatory
damages
at
the
administrative
level
is
a
party
seeking
compensatory
or
punitive
damages.
the
definition
of
complaining
party
specifically
includes
both
actions
and
proceedings,
and
so
that
provision
must
refer
to
all
instances
when
a
party--
mr.
timothy
m.
kelly
--clearly,
which
is
why
we
interpret
section
1981a
to
provide
for
compensatory
damages
at
the
federal
district
court
level,
not
at
the
administrative
level.
in
addition
to
the
right
to
a
jury
trial,
section
1981a(a)(1),
which
is
on
page
31a
of
the
appendix,
provides
in
the
operative
language
granting
the
right
to
compensatory
damages
for
compensatory
damages
in
an
action,
and
skipping
down
to
the
bottom
of
the
provision,
in
addition
to
any
relief
authorized
by
section
706(g)
of
the
civil
rights--
mr.
timothy
m.
kelly
--this
is
(a)(1)
of
1981a.
in
addition
to
any
relief
authorized
by
section
706(g)
of
the
civil
rights
act
of
1964.
those
provisions,
both
by
referring
to
an
action
as
opposed
to
a
proceeding,
and
by
referring
to
the
judicial
remedy
provision
of
title
vii,
which
is
706(g),
specifically
refer
to
actions,
civil
actions
in
federal
district
court,
and
not
to
administrative
proceedings.
in
title
vii,
as
the
court
recognized
in
new
york
gaslight
club
v.
carey,
in
general
the
term
action
refers
to
civil
action,
and
when
congress
is
referring
to
more
general
issues
of
state
and
local
and
administrative
enforcement,
it
almost
always
uses
the
word,
proceeding,
or
proceedings.
mr.
timothy
m.
kelly
i
do,
your
honor.
mr.
timothy
m.
kelly
in--
mr.
timothy
m.
kelly
--and
it's--
mr.
timothy
m.
kelly
--i'm
sorry,
justice,
i'm
not
understanding
in
what
circumstance
you
might
not
get
a
jury...
the
right
to
a
jury
trial
if
you
went
to
court.
by
my
reading--
mr.
timothy
m.
kelly
--as
i
understand
the
government's
argument,
it
is
that
they're
proceeding
under
section
717,
or
section
2000e-16,
that
is,
rather
than
under
section
1981a,
and
i
think
that
there
are
several
problems
with
that
approach.
mr.
timothy
m.
kelly
that's
the
way
that
i
understood
it,
your
honor.
mr.
timothy
m.
kelly
well,
and
judge,
i
think
that
the
answer
to
that
is
that
the
title
vii
procedures
for
federal
employees
have
always
been
perceived
as
primarily
a
conciliatory
mechanism
and
not
necessarily
an
adjudicatory
one.
the
idea
in
the
agency
is
to
resolve
the
problem,
get
the
employee
back
on
track
and
working,
and
working
at
the
level
that
he
should
be
working,
and
that
can
be
done
by
offering
compensatory
damages,
by
offering
equitable
relief,
and
there's
no
bar
in
the
statute
to
voluntary
mechanisms
for
achieving
that.
what
the
problem
comes
in
is
having
the
agency
award
compensatory
damages,
or
having
an
eeoc
force
an
agency
to
spend
money
in
compensatory
damages
to
an
employee.
i
think
that
there
are
really
four
reasons
that
congress
would
have
conferred
this
right
in
a
federal
district
court
and
not
in
an
administrative
agency.
the
first
is
the
independence
and
objectivity
of
the
judicial
branch.
these
employment
discrimination
suits
are
mainly
intramural
events
between
executive
branch
officials
and
their
agencies,
or
between
the
agencies
and
the
eeoc.
mr.
timothy
m.
kelly
it...
judge,
it's...
it's
our...
i'm
sorry,
justice
ginsburg,
it's
our
understanding
that
the
government,
like
a
private
litigant,
is
able
to
offer
relief
or
damages
in
settlement
in
anticipation
of
a
liability.
the
liability
for
compensatory
damages
at
the
federal
district
court
level
we
believe
authorizes
the
agency
to
offer
a
settlement.
this
is
done
voluntarily,
not
under
compulsion,
not...
and
only--
mr.
timothy
m.
kelly
--well,
it's
our
position
that
they
don't
have
the
ability
to
voluntarily
waive
sovereign
immunity.
mr.
timothy
m.
kelly
and--
mr.
timothy
m.
kelly
--and
it's
my
understanding
that
the
federal
government
is
able
to
make
a
settlement,
to
engage
in
voluntary
negotiation
in
the
same
way
that
a
private
party
is,
which
is
different
than
the
exercise
of
government--
mr.
timothy
m.
kelly
--i
believe
that
this
is...
and
there's...
the
comptroller
general's
office
has
issued
regulations
that
indicate
that
a
settlement
in
anticipation
of
litigation
is
an
appropriate
means
for--
mr.
timothy
m.
kelly
--that's
much
more
succinct
than--
mr.
timothy
m.
kelly
--i'm
not...
i'm
not
sure
if
it
was
a
question.
mr.
timothy
m.
kelly
like
any
other
litigants,
if
the
complainant
says,
if
you
don't
give
me
100,000
dollars
i'll
take
you
to
court,
i
think
that
the
agency
has
the
ability
to
take
into
consideration
a
compensatory
damage
claim
that
will
be
made
in
the
future
in
order
to
settle
the
case
in--
mr.
timothy
m.
kelly
--right.
mr.
timothy
m.
kelly
that's
right,
and
it's
clear
that
congress...
whether
he's
correct
or
not
in
wanting
100,000
dollars
for
compensatory
damages,
it's
clear
that
congress
gave
him
the
right
to
go
to
court
whether
he
gets
it
or
not.
mr.
timothy
m.
kelly
that's
right.
the
judiciary
acts
as
a
check
in
that
instance
on
executive
officials
awarding
nonpecuniary
compensatory
damages
to--
mr.
timothy
m.
kelly
--well,
and
that's
the
second
reason,
your
honor,
and
that's
the
expertise
of
the
federal
district
court
and
juries
in
awarding
compensatory
damages.
compensatory
damages
have
been
committed
to
the
judgment
of
juries
and
judges
for
at
least
a
couple
of
hundred
years.
mr.
timothy
m.
kelly
well,
there
are
no
punitive
damages
available
against
the
federal
government.
mr.
timothy
m.
kelly
the--
mr.
timothy
m.
kelly
--the
same
section,
subsection
(b),
indicates
that
the
eeoc
may
promulgate
rules,
regulations,
orders--
mr.
timothy
m.
kelly
--and
so
forth.
mr.
timothy
m.
kelly
well,
there's
a...
kind
of
a
glancing
blow
that
idea
in
section
2000e-16(c),
which
refers
to
the
procedure
that
needs
to
be
followed
before
the
case
goes
to
federal
district
court.
that
refers
to
the
time
limits
after
an
agency
decision,
and
if--
mr.
timothy
m.
kelly
--there
is
an
appeal
to
the
eeoc--
mr.
timothy
m.
kelly
--then
the
time
limit
after
the
eeoc.
mr.
timothy
m.
kelly
there
are
some
published
statistics.
unfortunately,
the
eeoc
doesn't
keep
its
statistics
according
to
the
number
of
compensatory
damages
cases
where
awards
were
made,
and
so
it's
impossible
to
say
how
many...
in
how
many
cases
compensatory
damages
were
awarded,
but
there
has
been
money
awarded
both
at
the
eeoc
level
and
at
the
agency
level
for
compensatory
damages,
according
to
the
statistics.
mr.
timothy
m.
kelly
well,
beginning
in
1992
with
the
jackson
decision,
which
by
the
way
is
not
published,
and
was
not
published
in
west
law
or
any
of
the
private
reporters,
not
all
eeoc
decisions
are
published
in
those
sources,
but
beginning
in
1992,
agencies
grudgingly
began
to
award
compensatory
damages,
or
at
least
consider
awards
of
compensatory
damages
in
certain
cases,
and
the
eeoc
generally
has
remanded
cases
for
consideration
of
compensatory
damages
rather
than
awarding
them
itself,
but
there
are
some
cases
where
the
eeoc
has
awarded
compensatory
damages.
mr.
timothy
m.
kelly
the
third
reason
i
think
is
parity
of
federal
employees
and
private
employees,
and
in
this
situation,
finally
i
think
congress
has
managed
to
put
federal
employees
and
private
employees
on
an
equal
standing
with
regard
to
compensatory
damages.
when
they've
attempted
that
in
the
past
they've
failed
for
various
reasons.
mr.
timothy
m.
kelly
they...
with
respect
to--
mr.
timothy
m.
kelly
--with
respect
to
all
of
the
damages
except
punitive
damages,
i
believe
that
they
are
on
a
parity.
mr.
timothy
m.
kelly
the
eeoc
doesn't
make
awards
against
private
employers.
the
function
of
the
eeoc
in
private
cases
is
entirely
conciliatory
in
mediation.
there's
no--
mr.
timothy
m.
kelly
--those
cases
go
to
court,
or
they're
settled
before
they
get
to
court.
mr.
timothy
m.
kelly
well,
the
congressional
accountability
act
sets
up
i
think
yet
another
scheme,
administrative
scheme
for
awarding
compensatory
damages,
and
that's
an
election
system.
after
90
days,
the
federal...
or
the
congressional
employee
has
the
option
of
either
staying
in
an
administrative
process
where
the
administrative
agency
is
explicitly
given
the
power
to
award
both
equitable
and
compensatory
damage
type
relief,
or
he
can
elect
to
go
outside
the
administrative
system
and
straight
to
federal
district
court.
mr.
timothy
m.
kelly
no.
it's
not
technically
the
eeoc
that
he
goes
to.
it's
an
administrative
agency
within
the
congress.
mr.
timothy
m.
kelly
but
no.
those
cases
are
appealed--
mr.
timothy
m.
kelly
--that's
correct,
judge.
mr.
timothy
m.
kelly
the
fourth--
[laughter]
mr.
timothy
m.
kelly
correct.
mr.
timothy
m.
kelly
correct.
mr.
timothy
m.
kelly
it's
my
understanding
that
the
federal
employee
is
still
required
to
exhaust
administrative
remedies
with
respect
to
the
equitable
relief
and
therefore
it
would
not
be
until
after
the
administrative
process
was
exhausted--
mr.
timothy
m.
kelly
--that
he
would
make
both
the
claim
for
equitable
relief
and
the
compensatory
damages--
mr.
timothy
m.
kelly
--well,
it
would
be
difficult
to
point
to
the
statute
and
say
what
the
answer
to
that
question
is,
but
in
brown
v.
general
services
administration
this
court
interpreted
section
2000e-16(c)
to
mean
that
the
federal
employee
is
required
as
a
prerequisite
to
going
into
federal
court
to
exhaust
administrative
remedies.
mr.
timothy
m.
kelly
there's
no
requirement
to
present
the
compensatory
damage
claim
to
the
agency.
there's
a
right
to
present
a
compensatory
damages
claim
in
the
first
instance
to
the
federal
district
court.
i
believe
that
there's
merit
in
the
suggestion
that
a
federal
employee
could
bring
a
compensatory
damage
claim
separately.
i
wonder
whether--
mr.
timothy
m.
kelly
--i
don't
think
that
that's
the
way
that
it
would
work,
your
honor.
mr.
timothy
m.
kelly
i
believe
that
the
jury
would
determine
the
factual
matters
in
that
it
would
determine
whether
discrimination
occurred
and
what
amount
of
compensatory
damages
was
available.
mr.
timothy
m.
kelly
i
think
that
the
judge
could
then
determine,
after
the
jury
had
decided
those
facts,
based
on
the
facts,
whether
equitable
relief
in
addition
to
the
compensatory
damages
was
appropriate
in
that
circumstance.
mr.
timothy
m.
kelly
the
amount
of--
mr.
timothy
m.
kelly
--i--
mr.
timothy
m.
kelly
--i...
and
i
agree
that
it
does
change
the
scheme.
i
understand
that
in
at
least
most
cases,
in
all
of
the
cases
that
i've
seen,
the
jury's
determination
as
to
discrimination
and
compensatory
damages
would
determine
the
outcome
of
the
equitable
relief
except
for--
mr.
timothy
m.
kelly
--that's
correct.
i
was
refer...
i'm
sorry,
i
was
referring
to
2000e-16(c),
which
is
the
federal
employee
section
of
title
vii,
not
the
new
compensatory
damage
remedy,
and
that
provision
has
been
determined
