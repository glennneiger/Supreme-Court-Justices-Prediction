justice
stephen
g.
breyer
since
1972
title
vii
of
the
civil
rights
act
has
forbidden
government
employers
to
discriminate
on
the
basis
of
race
or
color,
religion,
gender,
national
origin.
the
act
provides
a
remedial
system
so
in
the
case
of
the
government
employee,
who
think
he
has
been
discriminated
against,
that
employee
first
have
to
bring
a
complaint
to
the
department
that
employs
in
and
then
if
he
wants,
he
can
go
to
the
equal
opportunity
employment
commission
and
from
there
or
if
he
doesn't
want
he
can
go
directly
to
federal
court.
the
act
gives
to
the
equal
opportunity
employment
commission,
the
power
to
provide
"appropriate
remedy".
now,
before
1991
the
act
itself
contained
only
equitable
remedies
such
as
reinstatement
in
backpay
did
not
include
legal
remedies
like
compensatory
damages.
but
in
1991
congress
amended
the
act,
so
that
it
would
say
that
a
complaining
party
"may
recover
compensatory
damages"
in
an
action
brought
under
the
civil
rights
act.
now,
obviously
that
amendment
allows
the
government
employee
to
go
get
compensatory
damages
in
a
court
action.
but
does
it
also
permit
the
employee
to
obtain
compensatory
damages
from
the
eeoc,
if
he
goes
there
first
perhaps
on
his
way
to
court?
we
conclude
that
the
law
as
amended
in
1991
does
permit
the
eeoc
to
avoid
compensatory
damages.
remember
as
i
just
said
that
title
vii
gives
the
eeoc
the
power
to
provide
"appropriate
remedy".
now,
before
the
amendment
that
term
probably
did
not
include
compensatory
damages
because
the
act
like
title
vii
itself
only
provided
equitable
remedies,
but
after
the
amendment,
in
our
view,
compensatory
damages
became
appropriate.
as
we
explained
our
interpretation
of
the
statutory
languages
consistent
with
that
language
and
our
interpretation
furthers
congress'
remedial
purpose
because
it
encourages
the
use
of
less
expensive
administrative
remedies,
rather
than
requiring
more
expensive
court
actions
in
order
to
get
the
compensatory
damages.
we
find
nothing
in
the
law's
legislative
history
that
would
favor
any
contrary
interpretation
and
despite
certain
language
in
the
amendment
that
does
make
the
matter
less
than
absolutely
clear.
we
believe
it
is
clear
enough
to
satisfy
any
special
clarity
requirement
that
is
imposed
by
the
fact
that
this
might
be
involving
a
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity.
we
reverse
a
contrary
court
of
appeals
holding
and
we
remand
the
case
for
consideration
of
other
issues.
justice
kennedy
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
which
the
chief
justice
and
justices
scalia
and
thomas
have
joined.
