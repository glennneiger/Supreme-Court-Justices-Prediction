unknown
speaker
but
it
doesn't
specifically
say
by
the
eeoc
in
that
section,
does
it?
unknown
speaker
so
many
administrative
agencies
award
compensatory
damages?
unknown
speaker
in
those
instances
is
there
judicial
review
from
the
amount...
from
the
agency
award?
unknown
speaker
what
about
the
government?
unknown
speaker
so
in
the
other
statutory
instances
that
you
mentioned
in
your
answer
to
the
chief
justice,
i'm
curious
to
know,
are
there
any
instances
in
which
the
government
is
bound
and
cannot
have
judicial
review
of
the
amount
of
compensatory
damages
awarded
by
an
agency?
unknown
speaker
so
the
solicitor
general
is
arguing
here
for
the
proposition
that
the
government
is
subject
to
unreviewable
damage
awards
on
the
part
of
the
eeoc.
unknown
speaker
but
at
that
time
there
were
no
compensatory
damages
available.
unknown
speaker
the
government
would
have
the
usual
appeal
if
the
damages
were
awarded
in
the
district
court.
unknown
speaker
may
i
just
clarify
one
other
thing
about
the
damages.
supposing
that
the
employee
is
dissatis...
gets
damages
from
the
eeoc
but
he's
dissatisfied
with
the
amount.
is
it
your
view
that
the
employee
can
go...
still
file
an
action
seeking
greater
damages?
unknown
speaker
okay.
unknown
speaker
and
one
further
clarification.
is
the
eeoc
a
necessary
stop
for
the
employee,
or
can
the
employee
go
upon
the
agency
to
court?
if
the
agency
says
no,
no
discrimination,
or
discrimination
but
no
back
pay,
can
the
employee
skip
over
the
eeoc?
unknown
speaker
it
might
have
made
sense
for
congress
to
say,
if
you
want
damages
you
go
immediately
to
court,
and
if
you
don't
want
damages,
you
can
go
to
the
eeoc.
unknown
speaker
but
you
say...
it's
not
exhaustion
once
it's
an
option
that
the
employee
can
go
there
or
not,
and
the
second
leg
of
your
argument
that
i'm
having
difficulty
with,
i
don't
understand
the
extent
of
your
exhaustion,
waiver,
or
whatever.
suppose
the
employee
never
asks
the
agency,
it
just
said
to
the
agency,
you
discriminated
me...
against
me
on
the
basis
of
sex,
and
the
agency
said,
and
he
doesn't
specify
damages.
it
was
a
he
in
this
case.
does
he
forfeit
compensatory
damages
by
not
asking
for
it
before
the
agency,
or
does
the
forfeiture
come
only
from
not
asking
for
it
before
the
eeoc?
unknown
speaker
is
it
true
that
most
of
these
people
at
the
agency
level
are
not
represented
by
counsel?
unknown
speaker
well,
a
lay
person,
really,
terms
like
compensatory
damages,
they're
not
familiar
with
those
words.
does
the
agency
or
the
eeoc
have
some
kind
of
set
of
counsel,
instructions,
advice
that
says,
when
you
file
a
complaint
with
us,
this
is
what
you
can
complain
about,
these
are
the
possible
remedies,
so
then
we
could
say,
well,
the
employee
saw
that,
it's
an
intelligent
action?
unknown
speaker
well,
how
does
the
agency
know,
then,
what
amount
of
compensatory
damages
are
being
sought
when
it's
defending
these
charges
in
the
eeoc?
unknown
speaker
does
the
employee
file
some
sort
of
a
paper
that
says,
you
know,
i
want
50,000
dollars
in
compensatory
damages
before
the...
in
the
eeoc
proceeding?
unknown
speaker
and
so...
but
under
your
view
he
didn't
waive
compensatory
damages
by
not
asking
for
them?
unknown
speaker
well
then,
how--
unknown
speaker
--how
does
the
agency
know
how
to
defend
against
a
complaint
like
that
if
it
doesn't
even
request
compensatory
damages?
unknown
speaker
i
thought
you
said
just
a
minute
ago
he
didn't
have
to.
unknown
speaker
well,
but
could
it
be
at
the
very...
i
mean,
if
he
doesn't
have
to
do
it
in
his
complaint,
which
is
where
most
claims
for
compensatory
damages
are
made,
could
be
doe
it
at
the
very
end?
unknown
speaker
doesn't
it
put
the
agency
in
a
rather
peculiar
position?
it's
defending
against
a
claim,
and
at
the
same
time
you're
telling
us
that
it
will
advise
the
plaintiff
exactly
what
claim
he
has.
you
see
that
if
he
sees
that...
if
the
agency
sees
that
there's
a
basis
for
a
compensatory
claim,
the
agency
will
tell
them
to
make
a
compensatory
claim?
unknown
speaker
i
thought
you
said...
i
thought
you
were
referring
about
the
agency
by
which
he
is
was
employed.
he
initially
goes
to
that
agency,
doesn't
he?
unknown
speaker
now--
unknown
speaker
--and
you
say
he
has
to
make
the
compensatory
claim
before
that
agency,
as
well.
unknown
speaker
but
he
ordinarily
has
to
raise
it
before
the
employing
agency,
right?
unknown
speaker
and
you're
saying
that
the
employing
agency
is
going,
what,
out
of
the
goodness
of
its
heart,
to
advise
him
that
he
has
a
compensatory
claim
which
it
should
pay?
it
puts
the
employing
agency
in
a
strange
position.
it's
both
defending
against
the
claim,
and
supposedly
advising
the
plaintiff
as
to
what
claim
he
should
make.
unknown
speaker
well,
ms.
mcdowell,
this--
unknown
speaker
--the
requirements,
this
is
a
peculiar
kind
of
thing,
but
the...
isn't
the
agency
required
to
have
an
eeo
officer
who,
when
people
complain
about
discrimination,
is
there
to
aid
the
person,
so
you
have
the
agency
both
as
being
assistant
to
the
complainant,
and
the
agency
is
the
adversary,
but
am
i
wrong
in
thinking
that
the
agency
is
obliged
to
have
an
eeo
counselor?
unknown
speaker
by
the
agency
that
would
be
the
adversary?
unknown
speaker
the
informal
counseling.
unknown
speaker
and
that's
kind
of
a
conflict
of
interest,
where
the
agency
is
counseling
the
employee,
and
presumably
that's
to
tell
the
employee
what
his
rights
are,
and
then
the
agency
ends
up
being
the
target
of
whatever
complaint
the
employee
files,
but
the
agency
does
have
that
obligation,
to
be
a
counselor
to
the
employee.
unknown
speaker
turning
back
to
the
sovereign
immunity
basic
issue,
are
there
any
of
these
other
statutes
in
which
the
agency
has
discretion
to
determine
the
scope
of
a
sovereign
immunity
waiver?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
thought
you
argued
chevron
deference
as
to
what
is
an
appropriate
remedy.
are
you
withdrawing
that
part
of
your
argument?
unknown
speaker
well,
your
brief
says...
your
brief
quotes
the
chevron
rule
that
you
can
fill
in
gaps
that
are
left.
it
seems
to
me
that
you're
saying
that
we
should
defer
to
your
discretion
in
determining
the
scope
of
the
waiver.
are
there...
is
there
any
other
statute
when
an
agency
is
allowed
to
do
this?
unknown
speaker
what
would
happen
if
the
employee
goes
to
the
agency,
gets
counseled
by
the
eeo
advisor,
who
doesn't
say
anything
abut
the
various
types
of
damages,
skips
over
the
eeoc,
goes
directly
to
the
court,
at
that
point
the
employee
has
a
lawyer
and
asks
for
back
pay,
compensatory
damages,
whatever.
would
there
be
any
forfeiture
in
such
a
case?
unknown
speaker
even
though
we
are
envisioning
an
uncounseled
employee,
and
an
officer
in
the
agency
who
has
the
obligation
to
advise
this
uncounseled
person
about
his
rights?
unknown
speaker
it
seems
to
me
that
if
the
eeoc
is
monitoring
their
system,
it's
very
odd
that
there
aren't
instructions,
as
there
are
in
many
cases.
agencies
will
give
a
party
appeal
instructions,
if
you
don't
like
what
we
do
you
can
go
here,
and
not
to
tell
an
uncounseled
employee
who
just
says,
i
want
money,
what
the
options
are,
and
for
the
government
to
be
advocating
that
kind
of
a
forfeiture,
that
kind
of
a
waiver,
an
unintelligent
waiver,
seems
to
me
strange.
unknown
speaker
yes,
well,
usually
when
we
go
to
court,
that's
a
different
kind
of
setting,
but
here
we're
before
the
agency,
where
it's
supposed
to
be
not
an
adversary
relationship
at
first,
at
the
very
first
stage.
it's
an...
the
agency
says,
here,
we'll
give
you
a
counselor.
the
counselor
will
tell
you
all
about
what
your
rights
are.
and
then
you
say,
well,
the
counsel
should
have
told
him
that
he
waives
something
he
didn't
know
about.
it
just
strikes
me
as
strange.
unknown
speaker
well,
who
is
informing
them,
then,
if
they're
now
asking
for
something
that
a
lay
person
would...
that
term,
as
you
said,
that
magic
term
wouldn't
spring
into
the
head
of
uncounseled...
so
you
said...
and
that
may
be
what's
happening
now,
but
are
they
being
advised
by
someone
that
there
is
this
possibility?
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
you
a
factual
question
just
to...
in...
you
said
i
think
there
are
7,000
complaints
with
the
eeoc
every
year.
are
those
involving
government
employees?
unknown
speaker
and
in
80
percent
of
those,
damages
have
been
awarded
by
the
eeoc?
unknown
speaker
and...
but
what
roughly
is
the
percent
in
which
claims
of
compensatory
damages
are
made,
do
you
know?
well,
that's
the
80--
unknown
speaker
--oh,
that's
the
80
percent?
unknown
speaker
oh,
i
see,
but
they're...
now,
does
the
eeoc
write
some
kind
of
an
opinion
when
it
disposes
of
these
cases?
unknown
speaker
and
they're
all
reported,
are
they?
unknown
speaker
and
there
are
cases
in
which
the
eeoc
has
awarded
damages,
and
then
the
employee
later
sued
and
got
more
damages
in
court?
unknown
speaker
i
see.
unknown
speaker
how
many
cases
before
the
agency
request
compensatory
damages?
do
you
know
that?
unknown
speaker
and
that
is
probably
a
much
greater
number
of
cases
than
the
cases
that
go
to
the
commission.
i
mean,
most
of
the
cases
resolved
finally
at
the
agency
level?
unknown
speaker
can
the
agency
award
compensatory
damages?
unknown
speaker
well--
unknown
speaker
--and
what
would
be
the
authority
for
that,
the
statutory
authority?
unknown
speaker
well,
does
it
say
anything
about
awarding...
the
agency
awarding
appropriate
relief?
unknown
speaker
yes.
that
doesn't
help
you
much
with
the
agency,
though,
does
it?
unknown
speaker
and
it
would
be
a
very
strange
scheme,
it
seems
to
me,
if
you
don't
have
to
ask
for
compensatories
at
the
agency
level
but
you
do
at
the
eeoc
level,
especially
since
you
could
come
directly
from
the
agency
to
district
court
if
you
wanted
to.
unknown
speaker
i
see.
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
it
really
is
one
hypothesis
built
on
another.
i
mean,
you
have
questionable
authority
for
requiring
it
to
be
raised
before
the
eeoc,
and
your
only
authority
for
requiring
it
to
be
raised
and
allowing
the
original
agency
to
grant
compensatory
damages
is,
god,
if
you
allow
it
at
the
eeoc
it
doesn't
make
any
sense
not
to
allow
it
at
the
agency.
unknown
speaker
well,
we're--
unknown
speaker
--we're
talking
a
lot
of
cases
that
will
be
dumped
directly
into
district
courts.
i
mean,
more
than
the,
what
was
it,
7,000
from
the
eeoc.
it
may
well
be
that
a
large
number
of
cases
that
never
got
to
the
eeoc
that
were
resolved
at
the
agencies
with
compensatory
relief
would
not
be
resolved
there
any
more
but
would
have
to
come
to
the
district
courts
if
the
plaintiff
wanted
compensatory
relief.
unknown
speaker
is
there
any
sort
of
a
contested
proceeding
before
the
agency?
i
mean--
unknown
speaker
--really
the
only...
i
thought
the
only
way
an
agency
could
handle
the
case
would
be
to
settle
it
or
else
to
deny
relief.
unknown
speaker
does
the...
do
we
find
cases
in
which
the
agency
awards
compensatory
damages
against
itself?
unknown
speaker
could
you
focus
for
just
a
second,
please,
on
the
jury
trial
argument?
i
take
the
argument
against
you
as
being
that
1981
says
that
in
an
action
brought
under
717,
and
this
is
an
action
brought
under
717,
a
party
can
ask
for
compensatory
damages,
so
you
would
have
thought
they
could.
but
it
says
in
(c)
that
if
a
complaining
party
seeks
compensatory
damages
any
party
may
demand
a
trial
by
jury,
and
since
it's
obvious
the
eeoc
is
not
a
place
where
you'd
have
a
trial
by
jury,
it's
obvious
that
this
doesn't
apply
to
the
eeoc,
the
waiver
that's
in
1981.
that's
the
argument,
and
i'd
like
you
to
respond
to
that
argument.
unknown
speaker
now,
has
that
ever
been
determined?
i
ask
that
because
the
argument
continues,
the
government
isn't
going
to
be
able
to
ask
for
a
jury
trial.
they're
going
to
be
bound
by
the
eeoc.
do
you
mean
that
a
private
party
files
the
complaint
for
compensatories,
they're
denied,
and
then
does
the
whole
thing
over
again
in
the
trial
court?
is
that
your
position,
that
that's
what
that
provision
means?
unknown
speaker
has
it
ever
been
interpreted?
unknown
speaker
has
it
ever
been
interpreted
authoritatively?
unknown
speaker
but
the
government's
position
is
that
means
that
if
you
don't
get
compensatories
before
the
agency,
you
have
a
right
under
that
provision
to
have
the
issue
done
anew
in
the
trial
court.
unknown
speaker
of
course,
the
words
appropriate
remedies
were
also
in
2000e-16
before
they
included
compensatory
damages,
weren't
they?
unknown
speaker
no,
but
the
amendment
in
1981a,
the
jury
trial
point,
it
emphasized
it
focuses
on
actions
for
damages.
you
think
of
a
judicial
proceeding,
and
that
indirectly
is
amending
in
your
view
also
the
authority
of
the
eeoc
under
2000e-16.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
the
government...
there
is
a
right
to
a
jury
trial
on
both
sides
once
you
get
to
court,
in
your
view.
unknown
speaker
well,
but
this
is
less
favorable
to
the
government
than
simply
having
no
jury
trial
for
either
party.
here,
the
plaintiff
gets
to
go
to
district
court
if
he's
dissatisfied.
the
government
doesn't
get
to
go
at
all.
unknown
speaker
you
say
that
congress
made
this
choice
when
it
favors
your
position,
but
then
you
say
that
traditional
sovereign
immunity
principles
suggest
that
the
government
doesn't
like
jury
trials.
the
government
certainly
would
rather
have
a
jury
trial
than
no
trial
at
all,
i
would
think.
unknown
speaker
of
course,
when
the
government
has
no
trial
at
all,
it's
the
government's
own
fault,
right,
because
it's
the
government
itself
which
has
given
judgment
against
itself
at
the
agency
instance,
right,
so--
unknown
speaker
--yes.
unknown
speaker
you
could
blame
it
on
itself.
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
very
well,
ms.
mcdowell.
mr.
kelly,
we'll
hear
from
you.
unknown
speaker
and
i
suppose
it
goes
to
the
obligation
to
raise
the
issue
at
the
agency
level.
i
mean,
if
i
were
reading
that
form
i
would
not
get
a
hint
from
the
section
referring
to
corrective
action
that
it
might
be
appropriate
for
me
to
ask
for
damages.
unknown
speaker
mr.
kelly--
unknown
speaker
--the
records,
your
client's
name
is
michael
gibson
on
the
record.
is
there
any
particular
reason
you
refer
to
him
as
mike?
unknown
speaker
well,
this
is
a
court,
not
a
jury.
unknown
speaker
you
have
a
bad
form
there.
maybe
they
should
amend
the
form.
unknown
speaker
the
fact
that
that
doesn't
clearly
say...
and
i
agree
with
you,
corrective
action
does
not
suggest
compensatory
damages.
it
suggests
back
pay,
reinstatement,
and
so
forth,
so
they
should
devise
a
new
form.
unknown
speaker
i
mean,
they
have
to
make...
well,
i'm...
i
shouldn't
be
critical.
this
may
win
your
case,
but
it
doesn't...
but
not
on
the
ground
that
you're
arguing
for,
not
on
the
ground
that
the
statute
doesn't
require
it
to
be
asked
for.
maybe
on
the
ground
that
your
client
was
misled
or
something,
but--
unknown
speaker
--well,
we
didn't
grant
cert
on
that,
did
we,
and
if
it
came
to
that
we
would
probably...
my
guess
is
remand
to
let
them
figure
that
out.
unknown
speaker
well,
that...
i
repeat,
that's
really
not
the
issue
that
we're
interested
in.
why
don't
you
assume
for
purposes
of
your
argument
that
this
form
were
required
to
be
corrected,
as
the
government
would
doubtless
say
it
ought
to
be,
to
say
what...
not
what
corrective
action
are
you
seeking,
but
what
remedies
of
any
sort,
including
compensatory
damages,
are
you
seeking.
then
what
would
your
argument
be?
unknown
speaker
where
are
you
reading
from,
mr.
kelly?
unknown
speaker
and
where
will
we
find
that
in
the
brief?
unknown
speaker
thank
you.
unknown
speaker
and
yet
clearly
no
party
can
demand
a
trial
by
jury
before
the
eeoc.
unknown
speaker
this
is
(a)(1)
you're
reading
from?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
don't...
i...
going
back
for
a
second
to
your
jury
trial,
which
is
the
point
that
is
confusing
me
at
the
moment,
i
might
agree
with
you...
i
don't
see
how...
the
government
originally
said
that
if
it's
not
an
administrative
action
there'll
be
a
lot
of
extra
time,
expense,
disruption,
delay
to
give
them...
you
remember
that
in
their
brief,
or
petition
for
cert.--
unknown
speaker
--all
right.
i
accept
that
that's
not
so
if
you're
going
to
give
two
bites
at
the
apple
to
every
plaintiff,
but
in
their
brief
on
the
merits
here
they
don't
say
the
plaintiff
gets
two
bites
at
every
apple.
what
they
say
is,
maybe
there
isn't
a
jury
trial
right,
but
they
say
may...
in
footnote
19,
do
you
remember
that?
when
they
go
into
that,
they
say,
maybe
there
is,
maybe
there
isn't.
it
says,
arguably,
at
least,
the
federal
employee
is
not
proceeding
under
this
section.
do
you
remember
that?
unknown
speaker
and
it's
under
this
section
you
get
the
jury
trial
right.
unknown
speaker
my
question
is,
can
you
elucidate
that
a
little
bit?
i
mean,
i'd
get
your
point
completely
if
it's
really
true
there's
a
jury
trial
right,
but
i'm
not
sure
they've
conceded
that
in
their
brief,
and
so
i'd
like
a
little
bit
of
elaboration
on
the
assumption
that
there
isn't
a
jury
trial
right
for
a
plaintiff
who
says,
i
want...
he
says
to
the
agency,
i
want
a
compensatory
action.
you
get
that
before
the
agency,
but
maybe
you
don't
get
it
in
court.
i've
got
it
on
the
assumption
you
do
get
it
in
court,
but
what
if
it
isn't,
if
you
don't
have
a
jury
trial
right?
unknown
speaker
what
they
say
in
their
brief
is,
a
federal
employee
may
not
be
proceeding
under
this
section,
within
the
meaning
of
section
1981a(c)(1),
which
he
seeks
compensatory
damages
under
the
administrative
process.
he
is
instead
proceeding
under
42
u.s.c.
2000e-16(b),
which,
as
discussed
above,
gives
the
eeoc
the
authority
to
enforce
title
vii
remedies.
maybe
i
didn't
understand
that
properly.
unknown
speaker
mr.
kelly,
before
you
describe
the
problems,
did
you
understand
that
to...
the
government
to
be
saying
that
there's
no
right
to
jury
trial
in
the
court?
i
thought
that
this
was
just
an
explanation
of
why
there
is
no
right
to
jury
trial
before
the
agency.
unknown
speaker
maybe
that's
the
explanation.
maybe
that...
okay.
sorry.
skip
it.
it's
the
only
reason
i
didn't
underline
footnote
19
in
red
when
i
read
the
brief.
we
can
ask
the
solicitor
general
to
clarify
that,
but
it
seems
absolutely
clear
that
when
you're
in
district
court
you
get
a
jury
trial.
that's
what
congress
provided,
and...
but
your
reading
of
this
does
seem
to
me
a
little
strange,
because
you're
talking
about,
oh,
they
waive
sovereign
immunity,
the
government
waives
sovereign
immunity
but
only
in
district
court,
not
at
the
lower
level,
and
yet
congress
is
acting
in
the
interest
of
the
government.
when
you
get
into
court
with
a
jury,
there
is
the
possibility
of
a
bigger
box
than
what
you
would
get
before
the
agency,
so
in
the
government
interest
to
get
the
thing
wrapped
up
at
the
agency
level,
so
if
they're
going
to
waive
sovereign
immunity
before
a
jury,
then
it
seems
most
likely
that
they
will
say,
of
course
we'd
rather
have
it
disposed
of
without
making
it
a
federal
case
and
without
the
possibility
of
a
jury
making
the
award.
unknown
speaker
before
you
go
onto
that,
can
you
go
back
to
what
you
said
before,
because
i'm
not
sure
i
grasped
it.
i
thought...
are
you
saying
that
if
the
agency
wants
to,
it...
what
authority,
in
your
view,
does
the
agency
and
eeoc
have
to...
with
respect
to
compensatory
damages?
unknown
speaker
but
i
didn't
know
that
the
agencies
had
authority
to
voluntarily
waive
sovereign
immunity
unless
congress
sanctioned
that.
unknown
speaker
but
you
just
said
that
they
could
make
a
settlement
that
included--
unknown
speaker
--compensatory
damages.
unknown
speaker
there's
some
general
settlement
statute,
isn't
there?
i
think
there
used
to
be,
anyway.
unknown
speaker
isn't
that
the
answer?
they
can
always
anticipate
that
at
some
point
the
claimant
will
end
up
in
court,
and
they
know
that
if
the
claimant
ends
up
in
court,
there
can
be
damages,
so
therefore
their
settlement
authority
would
include
the
payment
of
something
with
respect
to
compensatory
damages.
that
would...
isn't
that
the
answer
to
sort
of
the
waiver
problem?
unknown
speaker
the
trouble
is,
i
don't
know
of
any
settlement
authority
to
settle
for
more
than
is
asked
for,
and
what
you're
allowed
to
ask
the
agency
for
is
restitution,
you
know,
back
pay
and
reinstatement.
it's
hard
to
come
under
a
settlement
authority
when,
you
know,
you're
asking
for
100,000
dollars
and
the
agency
says,
well,
we'll
settle
for
two.
i
doubt
whether
that
comes
within
the
settlement
authority.
may
i...
i'm
sorry,
have
you
answered
his
question?
unknown
speaker
that's
what
you're
saying,
isn't
it,
that
you
can
come
before
an
agency
with
no
compensatory
claims,
just
reinstatement
and
back
pay,
and
say,
you
know,
i
want
100,000
dollars
and
the
agency
says,
well,
you
know,
we'll
settle
for
two.
can
the
agency
do
that?
unknown
speaker
so
all
he
has
to
say
is,
i
want
back
pay,
i
want
reinstatement,
and
i
want
100,000
dollars.
unknown
speaker
and
if
you
don't
give
it
to
me,
i'm
going
to
go
to
court.
unknown
speaker
are
you...
you
were
in
the
midst
of
four
reasons,
and
the
first
one
was
the,
i
guess
relative
objectivity
of
the
court.
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
isn't
the
danger
not
that
executive
officials
are
going
to
give
the
bank
away,
but
that
a
jury
is
going
to
give
the
bank
away?
unknown
speaker
of
course,
your--
--the
expertise
of
juries?
that's
the
reverse
chevron
doctrine.
[laughter]
your
argument
has
to
be
the
same,
i
take
it,
for
punitive
damages.
unknown
speaker
you're
basically...
you've
clarified--
--may
i
ask
a
question
about
this...
i
really
am
confused
about
this
statutory
scheme,
i
have
to
confess.
i
had
read,
before
getting
more
confused
during
the
argument--
[laughter]
--the
2000e-16(b)
as
the
kind
of
authority
to
eeoc
where
the
eeoc
was
the
original,
you
might
say
the
nisi
prius
tribunal,
where
an
original
complaint
is
filed
with
them,
but
actually
in
the
system
as
it
actually
works,
the
eeoc
is
sort
of
an
appellate
tribunal.
it
reviews
what
the
separate
agencies
do.
is
there
any
statutory
language
anywhere
that
says
that
what
they're
supposed
to
do,
that
they
have
a
review
function
that
in
fact
passes
on--
unknown
speaker
--and
if
so,
where
is
it?
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
but
decide
cases
on
review
of
decisions
by
other
agencies,
does
anything
say
that?
unknown
speaker
i
see.
yes,
right.
unknown
speaker
thank
you.
unknown
speaker
do
you
just...
one
quick
thing.
surprisingly
enough,
you
did
clarify
the
role
of
the
jury
in
my
mind.
the
other
thing
i'm
not
certain
on
is,
i
gather
in...
historically
speaking
there's...
what
i
heard
was
the
government
say
about
80
percent
of
these
types
of
complaints
before
the
eeoc
do
ask
for
some
kind
of
compensatory
damages
in
some
way
or
other.
have
you
any
rough
idea
as
to
how
many
cases
they
were
granted
in?
is
this
zero?
is
this
the
first
one?
is
it...
do
we
have
any
rough
idea
of
what
the
history
is?
unknown
speaker
so
there's
some
kind
of
practice
and
history
of
them
awarding
compensatory
damages.
unknown
speaker
can
you
go
back
and
finish
your
fourth...
i
mean--
--three
and
four.
our
attention
span
is
really
not
that
long.
[laughter]
i'm
glad
you
didn't
have
seven
or
eight
points,
because...
what
are
three
and
four?
could
you
tell
us
quickly?
unknown
speaker
but
they
have
not
put
private
employers
and
federal
employers
on
a
parity,
have
they,
for
damages?
unknown
speaker
so
far
as
the
right
to
go
from
the
agency
to
court.
unknown
speaker
well,
a
private
employer
can
appeal
an
eeoc
award
to
the
district
court,
can
it
not?
unknown
speaker
so
it
has
to
go
to
court
itself
to--
unknown
speaker
--and
how
does
it
work
with
the
legislative
employees,
because
that's
yet
another
scheme.
we
have
the
private
sector,
we
have
the
federal
government,
and
what
is
for
the
legislative
employees?
unknown
speaker
in
the...
for
the
legislative
employee,
if
he
elects
the
administrative
route,
the
eeoc
route,
is...
can
he,
as
in
the
case
of
an
executive
employee,
go
to
court
at
the
end
of
the
line
for
de
novo
review
if
he's
dissatisfied?
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
so
it's
self-contained.
it's
either,
you
get
court
route,
or
you
get
the
administrative
route,
but
you
don't
get,
as
with
executive
employees
you
can
go
to
the
eeoc
if
you
want
to,
but
you've
always
got
a
right
in
the
end
to
come
to
court.
unknown
speaker
i
give
up,
mr.
kelly.
i'm
not
going
to
wait
for
your
fourth
point.
unknown
speaker
i
have
a
question
that
has
perplexed
me.
what
happens
when
you...
when
a
claimant
brings
an
action
or
a
proceeding
before...
administratively,
is
unsatisfied
with
the
result,
and
therefore
may
institute
suit
in
district
court
for
the
back
pay
and
the
reinstatement
remedy,
right?
unknown
speaker
now,
that
same
claimant
under
your
system,
if
he
had
a
compensatory
damages
claim,
would
have
filed
a
compensatory
damages
claim
in
district
court.
unknown
speaker
do
those
two
district
court
actions
now
proceed
separately?
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
why?
why
would
he
make
them
all
together?
i
mean,
why
couldn't
he
file
a
suit
immediately
for
the
compensatory
relief
while
he's
asking
for
the
other
relief
administratively,
if
there's
no
exhaustion
requirement?
unknown
speaker
but
you're
telling
us
there's
no
exhaustion.
i
mean,
i
thought
your
whole
case
was
that
there's
no
exhaustion
requirement
in
this
situation.
unknown
speaker
if
he
brought
them
all
together,
if
he
waited
for
the
agency
to
deny
his
back
pay
and
reinstatement
claim,
and
then
he
could
bring
them
all
together
and
get
a
jury
trial
on
the
back
pay
and
reinstatement,
which
he
would
not
get
otherwise.
unknown
speaker
well,
if
you're
entitled
to
a
jury,
you're
entitled
to
a
jury
on
all
the
factual
questions
in
the
case.
you
can't
have
the
jury
deciding
the
facts
one
way
and
the
judge
deciding
it
another
for
the
other
two
issues.
i
mean,
surely
the
jury
would
determine
all
the
factual
matters,
wouldn't
it?
unknown
speaker
and--
unknown
speaker
--but
the
amount
of
back
pay
due,
that
factual
matter
would
be
decided
by
the
jury,
i
guess,
wouldn't
it?
unknown
speaker
and
the
level
of
reinstatement
to
which
he
was
entitled,
i
would
assume
that's
a
factual
matter.
that
would
be
decided
by
the
jury.
unknown
speaker
i
don't
know.
i
mean,
it
just
changes
the
scheme
a
whole
lot,
that's
what
i'm
saying
here,
when
you
pour
them
all
into
one
action.
unknown
speaker
well,
you
don't
have
to
read
subsection
(c)
the
way
you're
reading
it.
it
says,
if
a
complaining
party
seeks
compensatory
or
punitive
damages
under
this
section,
any
party
may
demand
a
jury
trial.
you
could
read
that
as
limiting
the
right
to
jury
trial
to
the
demand
for
compensatory
damages.
unknown
speaker
but
mr.
kelly,
i
thought
your
point
was
that,
to
the
extent
that
there
are
common
fact
questions
like,
was
there
discrimination,
how
long
did
it
go
on,
if
you
have
a
combined
legal
and
equitable
claim,
the
jury
goes
first,
and
the
jury's
findings
of
fact
become
issue
preclusive
on
the
judge.
that
was
settled
in
beacon
theaters
and
dairy
queen
decades
ago
by
this
court.
unknown
speaker
thank
you,
mr.
kelly.
ms.
mcdowell,
you
have
2
minutes
remaining.
unknown
speaker
no,
no,
you
needn't.
i
think
i
understand
it.
the
key
are
the
words,
this
section.
this
section
refers
to
1981,
not
717.
unknown
speaker
okay.
you
don't
need
to
go
further.
you
have
2
minutes.
unknown
speaker
agency
level,
do
you
mean
eeoc,
or
the
original--
unknown
speaker
--yes,
i
have
one--
unknown
speaker
--further,
and
that's
again
on
the
forfeiture,
or
waiver,
whatever
you
call
it.
it
seems
that
if
you
are
insisting
that
the
employee
ask
for
this
before
the
agency,
ask
for
it
before
the
eeoc,
instead
of
taking
it
out
of
a
general
demand
for
relief,
then
you're
asking
for
an
exactness
in
the
administrative
proceeding
that
54(c)
says,
in
court...
it
says,
the
court
will
give
you
the
relief
to
which
you're
entitled
even
if
you
haven't
asked
specifically
for
it.
