mr.
ernest
gellhorn
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
is
basically
a
question
of
statutory
construction,
of
construction
of
section
12
of
the
administrative
procedure
act
as
originally
adopted,
and
what
we
have
here
are
two
or
three,
we
believe,
relatively
straight-forward
questions.
the
first
is
whether
the
judicial
review
standard
applies
or
is
covered,
encompassed
by
section
12.
section
12
starts
out
that,
nothing
in
this
act.
we
believe
that
that
covers
the
preceding
sections
rather
clearly.
likewise
judicial
review
is,
we
believe,
a
requirement
because
judicial
review
imposes
upon
the
agency
an
obligation
to
meet
a
certain
standard,
here
that
its
evidence
meet
the
clearly
erroneous
test.
then
there
are
two
questions
related
to
the
clearly
erroneous
test.
first,
does
the
clearly
erroneous
test
constitute
an
additional
requirement
beyond
that
imposed
by
the
administrative
procedure
act.
again,
we
believe
that
this
court
has
spoken
on
that
issue
relatively
clearly
in
1993
in
the
concrete
products
case,
which
we
researched
after
receiving
the
government's
reply
brief.
and
there
this
court
said
that
review
under
the
clearly
erroneous
standard
is
significantly
deferential,
requiring
a
definite
and
firm
conviction
that
a
mistake
has
been
committed,
and
application
of
a
reasonableness
standard,
i.e.,
the
substantial
evidence
test,
is
even
more
deferential,
so
what
we
have
here
is
an
additional
requirement.
in
addition,
we
have
under
the
clearly
erroneous
test
what
we
believe
is
clearly
recognized
law.
we
identified
43
cases
in
which
clearly
erroneous--
mr.
ernest
gellhorn
--they,
as
far
as
we
know,
fairly
summarized
them,
but
we
would
point
out
that
their
argument
is
in
effect...
first
of
all,
there
are
not
just
36
cases.
we
identified
43.
the
new
york
amici
brief
lists
90
between
1929--
mr.
ernest
gellhorn
--not
that
we
could
identify,
but
there
are,
of
course,
other
cases
where
they
reversed
the
examiner.
and
what
we
would
suggest
here
is,
you
had
an
established
practice,
well-settled
law
stated
by
the
court
of
customs
and
patent
appeals
in
1930.
you
have
no
announcement
of
the
standard
in
most
cases,
because
they
know
what
it
is.
nobody
is
debating
it.
the
court
makes
law,
as
we
hope
it
will
in
this
instance,
by
affirmance.
the
fact
that
there's
been
fewer
reversals
tells
us
absolutely
nothing
about
the
standard
and,
in
fact,
what
we
have
is
a
very
consistent
and,
we
would
suggest,
single
standard.
what
we
have
is
the
use
of
different
terms:
clear
error,
manifestly
wrong,
manifest
error.
common
law
courts
frequently
use
slightly
different
language,
but
the
message
here
is
one
of
remarkable
consistency.
mr.
ernest
gellhorn
justice
souter,
the
federal
circuit
said
there
was
a
clearly
articulated
standard.
they
said
it
was...
they
used
different
terminology,
but
they
used
them
interchangeably.
so
we're
not
talking
practice.
we're
talking
about
a
standard
that
had
been
adopted
by
the
court
of
customs
and
patent
appeals,
and
everybody
believed
it
and
understood
it
at
the
time.
mr.
ernest
gellhorn
yes,
your
honor,
and
it
goes
back
to
morgan
v.
daniels
in
1894.
mr.
ernest
gellhorn
yes,
your
honor.
many
of
the
cases
used
the
term
clearly
erroneous.
mr.
ernest
gellhorn
they
used
the
term
manifestly
wrong.
mr.
ernest
gellhorn
they
called
them...
they
stated
that
they
were
interchangeable.
they
would
intercite
each
other,
and
there
was--
mr.
ernest
gellhorn
--as
this
court
has
said,
in
fact,
it
is
more
and,
as
it
has
been
used
by
the
court
of
customs
and
patent
appeals,
it
was
always
more,
and
what
we're
talking
about
is
two
elements.
under
the
substantial
evidence
test,
we're
talking
about
what's
the
quantum
of
evidence
in
the
record,
as
this
court
stated
in
the
steadman
case.
in
the
clearly
erroneous
test,
you
include
the
substantial
evidence
test
and
add
a
qualitative
evaluation.
is
that
evidence,
when
looked
at
in
its
entirety,
persuasive
enough
to
persuade
us
that
they
didn't
make
a
mistake?
now,
there's
deference
in
both
situations,
but
much
greater
deference
in
applying
the
substantial
evidence
test.
mr.
ernest
gellhorn
please
recall,
your
honor,
that
the
court
of
customs
and
patent
appeals
continued
with
its
jurisdiction
over
the
patent
office
from
1946
to
1982,
so
they
were
continuing
a
tradition
they
had
already
started.
nothing
had
changed.
everybody
had
understood
that
the
administrative
procedure
act
did
not
affect
the
standard
of
review,
so
you
see
no
discussion
of
it.
when
the
federal
circuit--
mr.
ernest
gellhorn
--as
far
as
we
know,
the
issue
was
not
raised.
the
issue--
mr.
ernest
gellhorn
--as
quoted
on
page
38
of
our
brief,
your
honor,
senator
mccarran,
in
discussing
the
administrative
procedure
act,
made
clear
that
it
is
an
outline
of
basic
essentials.
it
was
not,
in
other
words,
suggested
to
be
a
cap.
on
the
other
hand,
of
course,
there
also
was
provided
in
section
12
specific
ways
to
alter
the
standard.
one
is,
looking
retrospectively.
under
the
first
sentence
you
look
back
to
prior
law,
and
if
that
prior
law
was
more
demanding,
more
obligatory,
added
requirements,
that
continued.
for
future
changes,
however,
it
required
an
express
statute,
but
there
was
no
limitation
that
it
be
an
additional
requirement.
and
we
think,
in
that
construct
it
makes
sense
to
interpret
this
as
being
a
situation
that
we
had
law
established
over
many
years.
the
only
time
the
word
substantial
evidence
was
mentioned
is
in
the
two
cases
identified
by
the
government
happened
to
be
not
reviews
of
the
patent
office
by
the
court
of
customs
and
patent
appeals,
but
reviews
by
the
district
court,
an
issue,
of
course,
totally
irrelevant
to
this
case.
because
the
only
thing
we're
talking
about
here
is
the
standard
of
review
applied
by
the
court
of
customs
and
patent
appeals
to
decisions
made
by
the
board
or
the
patent
office.
mr.
ernest
gellhorn
it
clearly
matters
in
terms
of
the
view
of
the
court
of
federal
appeals...
excuse
me,
the
court
of
the
federal
circuit.
they
have
stated
that.
we
believe
in
this
case
that
we
would
be
sustained
under
either
test.
but...
and
it
has
not
been
established
to
the
contrary.
and
we
also
have
only
evidence
that
in
terms
of
the
last
decade,
in
the
1990s,
there
have
been
32
reversals
of
the
patent
office
by
the
federal
circuit.
so
there...
this
is
not
a
test
that
has
been
overused.
it
is
not
unduly
intrusive,
as
the
government
suggests.
on
the
other
hand,
now,
as
long
as
you're
following
one
standard,
you're
unlikely
to
find
cases
that
say
it
makes
a
difference
if
we
would
adopt
another
standard.
mr.
ernest
gellhorn
not
to
our
knowledge,
your
honor.
however,
i
think
it
really
relates
to
the
standard
of
obviousness,
articulated
by
this
court
in
graham
v.
john
deere,
where
we
have
three
questions
that
are
put
before
the
agency
and
the
court
in
terms
of
determining
obviousness.
one,
what
were
the
claims
made;
two,
what
was
the
prior
art,
the
difference
between
the
claims
and
the
prior
art;
and,
third,
would
a
person
of
ordinary
skill
in
this
field
have
known
that
additional
difference?
now,
all
of
that
is
presented
to
the
patent
office
and
to
the
board
on
a
written
record.
there's
no
cross-examination,
there's
no
direct
testimony,
there
are
no
expert
witnesses,
and
so
what
we
have
is
a
record
that
is
available
to
the
federal
circuit
on
the
same
basis
that
it
is
available
to
the
board
and
therefore
the
federal
circuit
is
in
the
position
to
make
that
evaluation,
and
to
determine
what
is
the
result
in
light
of
the
evidence
presented.
it's
not
a
question
of
testing
the
demeanor
of
witnesses.
mr.
ernest
gellhorn
i
think
that's...
i
think
the
bar
is
united
on
that,
and
the
summary
is
perhaps
best
expressed
in
the
new
york
intellectual
property
lawyers
association
brief,
which
goes
through
the
cases,
the
90
cases.
it
lists
them
all,
and
identifies
that
feeling.
but
it
also--
mr.
ernest
gellhorn
--of
course
not,
your
honor.
mr.
ernest
gellhorn
on
the
other
hand,
that
doesn't
lessen
its
importance
or
its
impact.
in
other
words,
it
seems
to
me
that
what
we
have
here
is
a
situation
in
which
the
courts
have,
almost
without
exception,
used
the
same
genre
of
terminology
to
talk
about
a
more
intru...
or
a
more
rigorous
review.
second,
nobody
has
challenged
it.
third,
you
have
a
situation
where
the
opinions
are
relatively
short,
so
you're
not
going
to
get
a
long
discussion
on
it.
when
the
issue
comes
up,
then,
before
the
court
of
the
federal
circuit,
which
included,
of
course,
and
still
includes,
judges
who
had
been
on
the
court
of
customs
and
patent
appeals,
without
dissent,
they
all
adopt
the
understanding
that
the
clearly
erroneous
test
was
the
one
that
was
to
be
applied.
and
we
think,
therefore,
under
section
12
of
the
administrative
procedure
act,
you
have
recognized
law.
it
constitutes
an
additional
requirement
because
it
imposes
upon
the
agency
a
standard
of
evidence
that
it
otherwise
would
not
have
to
meet
and,
we
would
suggest,
it
is
consistent
with
the
administrative
procedure
act's
establishment
of
higher
standards.
at
the
time--
mr.
ernest
gellhorn
--i...
there's
no
question
that
the
substantial
evidence
test
and
the
arbitrary
and
capricious
test
are
different
from.
now,
when
does
different
become
inconsistent?
it
seems
to
me
that
is
a
metaphysical
question
that
i'm
not
prepared
to
respond
to.
on
the
other
hand,
the
question
is,
is
it
absolutely
inconsistent?
is
it
repugnant
to?
in
that
circumstance,
the
savings
clause
generally
would
not
preserve
the
preexisting
standard.
but
we
have
a
situation
in
which
the
statute
by
its
own
terms
say
an
additional
requirement
shall
be
continued.
well,
that
would
suggest
that
the
mere
fact
that
it
is
inconsistent
is
no
reason
not
to
permit
it
to
go
forward.
the
consolo
court
was
merely...
focused
solely
on
the
substantial
evidence
test--
mr.
ernest
gellhorn
--that's
correct.
we
agree,
your
honor.
and
there's
no
doubt
that
at
the
time
the
administrative
procedure
act
was
being
considered,
there
was
considerable
debate
about
the
meaning
of
the
substantial
evidence
test,
even
though
this
court
had
spoken
rather
clearly
in
consolidated
edison
and
columbia
and
amway.
mr.
ernest
gellhorn
but
the
entire
thinking
at
the
time
was,
we
want
to
set
a
floor
which
the
agencies
must
meet
in
terms
of
procedure
and
which
the
courts
should
apply
on
a
uniform
basis.
on
the
other
hand,
recognizing
that
they
had
not
studied
all
agencies,
the
attorney
general's
committee
that
was
examining
administrative
procedure
studied
28
agencies
and
issued
27
monographs,
but
identified
51
agencies.
mr.
ernest
gellhorn
yes,
sir.
proud
to
be.
and
in
that
situation,
there
were
23
agencies
that
the
government
had
not
studied.
they
didn't
pretend
to
know
all
of
the
answers,
and
as
a
result,
wisely
put
in
a
provision
that
if
there
are
others
out
there,
they
should
continue.
now,
to
respond
to
a
question
posed
earlier...
are
there
any
other
situations
in
which
this
is
likely
to
arise
+/?
we
can
find
absolutely
none.
we
have
looked
with
care.
there
is
perhaps
one,
and
that
is
the
plant
protection
act,
which
is
also
reviewed
by
the
federal
circuit,
and
it
does
not
have
a
stated
standard
of
review.
on
the
other
hand,
there
have
only
been
three
cases
since
1930,
none
of
which
addressed
the
substantial
evidence
or
the
review
standard.
we
don't
believe
it's
going
to
arise
in
any
other
circumstance.
mr.
ernest
gellhorn
i
don't
believe
that's
an
accurate
statement
simply
because
there
are
virtually
no
district
court
cases,
and
there
is
no
precedent
or
history,
to
my
understanding,
of
the
patent
office
making
substantial
admissions.
expert
testimony,
for
example,
is
unheard
of
in
these
cases.
these
cases
are
not
decided
on
the
basis
of
expert
testimony.
mr.
ernest
gellhorn
they
don't
use
it
because
it's
far
more
expensive.
it's
much
quicker
to
go
to
the
court
of
appeals,
and
the
court
of
appeals
has
been
understanding
and
is
expert
in
the
understanding
of
patent
applications.
whereas
when
you
come
to
the
district
court,
you
are
facing
a
much
less
uncertain
situation
of
a
generalist
district
court
being
faced
or
obliged
to
make
that
determination.
mr.
ernest
gellhorn
as
we
cite
on
page
37
of
our
brief,
there
are
permitted
under
the
rules
that
the
board
would
take
additional
evidence.
mr.
ernest
gellhorn
now,
that
additional
evidence,
however,
make
come
in
by
the
board
itself
identifying
that
evidence,
not
telling
the
parties...
the
party
about
it,
and
relying
upon
that
evidence
in
its
decision,
one
more
reason
why
this
is
not
a
closed
record.
mr.
ernest
gellhorn
yes.
mr.
ernest
gellhorn
that's
correct.
that
is
the
government's
reply
brief,
and
that's
an
accurate
quote.
we
also
make
the
same
point
in
the
quote
from
an
individual
named
zitmer
in
our
brief.
but
what
they're
saying
is
they
have
the
understanding
that
the
clearly
erroneous
test
was
applied
and
that
it
could
continue
to
apply.
now,
it
may
be
that
they
hadn't
read
the
apa
with
great
care.
i'm
not
certain,
of
course,
whether
they
knew
about
section
12
or
not.
but
the
point
was,
their
understanding
in
1946
was
that
the
standard
then
being
applied
by
the
court
of
customs
and
patent
appeals,
the
clearly
erroneous
standard,
was
not
being
changed.
and
there
is
no
case
in
the
90
cases
where
anything
other
than
clearly
erroneous
or
its
equivalent
was
being
articulated.
mr.
ernest
gellhorn
but
clearly
erroneous
test,
in
terms
of
patent
law,
has
a
longer
history.
it
goes
back--
mr.
ernest
gellhorn
--well,
except
that
the
court
used...
this
court
used
the
same
words
as
the
gypsum
court
test
of
a
firm
conviction
to
identify
the
standard.
and
that's...
and
it
hasn't
changed
in
any
case
that
we
were
able
to
find
of
this
court
under
the
clearly
erroneous
standard,
so
we
believe
that
there
is
no
basis
to
identify
any
other
test.
mr.
ernest
gellhorn
that's
correct,
your
honor,
we
believe
that--
mr.
ernest
gellhorn
--well,
your
honor,
we
believe
it's
very
clear,
there
is
no
statute
requiring
a
hearing
on
a
record
before
the
patent
board.
mr.
ernest
gellhorn
we
agree
with
that
statement,
your
honor.
we
think
that
the
substantial
evidence
test
under
706(2)(e)
does
not
apply
because
there
is
no
hearing
on
an
agency
record.
we
submitted
that
as
part
of
our
brief
to
the
federal
circuit.
we--
mr.
ernest
gellhorn
--no,
we
do
not--
mr.
ernest
gellhorn
--the
understanding,
we
believe,
of
the
courts,
is
that
the
arbitrary
and
capricious
test
is
less
rigorous
and
less
demanding.
mr.
ernest
gellhorn
right.
mr.
ernest
gellhorn
right.
mr.
ernest
gellhorn
that
is
also
our
understanding,
your
honor.
i
hope
i
wasn't
misleading
justice
breyer.
mr.
ernest
gellhorn
i
had
understood
both
you
and
justice
breyer
to
agree
on
this
point.
and
this
court
has
spoken
frequently,
actually,
on
it.
if
you
look
at
the
benzene
case,
it
talks
about
the
arbitrary
and
capricious
test
as
not
being
as
demanding
as
the
substantial
evidence
test.
if
you
look
at
the
cases
where
congress
has
imposed
the
substantial
evidence
test
on
review
of
rulemaking,
rather
than
the
arbitrary
and
capricious
test,
there
is
discussion
that
that
is
more
demanding.
if
you
look
at
this
court's
opinion
in
concrete
products,
it
makes
it
clear--
mr.
ernest
gellhorn
--no,
i
think
we
would
posit
the
opposite
way,
your
honor.
we
would
say
that
there
may
be
a
quantum
of
evidence
to
take
it
to
the
jury,
but
it
still
would
not
be
persuasive
enough
to
satisfy
the
clearly
erroneous
test.
mr.
ernest
gellhorn
no.
mr.
ernest
gellhorn
we
accept
that
and
accept
your
opinion
in
the--
mr.
ernest
gellhorn
--no.
i
wouldn't
reach
it
in
that
way,
your
honor.
[laughter]
there's
no
question
that
the...
that
the
terminology
does
not
have
a
hard
edge
to
it,
and
does
not
necessarily
give
us
precise
guidance.
on
the
other
hand,
it
does
do
what
this
court
said
in
1951,
it
expresses
a
mood.
it
talks
about
the
kind
of
care
we
expect
the
agency
to
engage
in.
we've
operated
here...
the
patent
office
has
operated
for
all
of
these
years
under
the
clearly
erroneous
standard.
that
changes
its
behavior.
and
one
ought
to
understand,
they
get
200,000
applications
a
year.
in
1998,
they
rejected
48,000
of
them.
we're
talking
about
a
situation
where
subtleties
are
not
insignificant
and
they
have
an
impact.
and
if
this
court
were
to
conclude--
mr.
ernest
gellhorn
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
ernest
gellhorn
154,000--
mr.
ernest
gellhorn
--and
those
154,000
do
not
come
before
this
court.
they
have
no
complaint.
[laughter]
mr.
ernest
gellhorn
now,
i
do
want
to
answer
a
question
that
came
up,
that
the
court
below
used
the
terminology,
our
reasoning,
which
was
discussed
earlier
in
the
questioning
of
government
counsel.
and
while
we
wouldn't
necessarily
have
selected
that
word,
we
do
think
it
does
not
undercut
the
opinion.
first
of
all,
we
could
find
no
other
decision
by
the
ccpa
or
the
federal
circuit
that
used
it,
so
i
don't
think
it's
intimately
affected
with
the
clearly
erroneous
test.
in
addition,
we
believe
it's
actually
inherent
in
the
clearly
erroneous
test
because
it
was
used
initially
by
this
court.
mr.
ernest
gellhorn
our
reasoning.
mr.
ernest
gellhorn
our
reasoning.
there
was
a
discussion
earlier
by
the
court
with
mr.
wallace
on
the
meaning
of
the
term,
our
reasoning,
and
what
does
it
mean
in
connection
with
the
clearly
erroneous
test.
and
what
i
was
seeking
to
explain
was,
that
that
was
not
introducing
some
kind
of
new
concept
that
was
unheard
of.
in
fact,
it's
origin,
as
far
as
we
can
tell,
is
this
court's
opinion
in
district
of
columbia
v.
pace,
a
1944
decision.
mr.
ernest
gellhorn
but
if
you
look
at
the
decision
of
this
court
in
the
pace
case,
it
uses
the
term
that
if
it's
clear
error,
then
there
is
no
support
in
reason
if
the
second
court
could
not
make
its
finding
as
a
result
of
its
own
judgment.
and
all
that
our
reasoning
language
means,
we
believe,
is
that
the
court
applying
the
clearly
erroneous
test
is
deciding
for
itself
whether
or
not
that
evidence
is
sufficient,
and
that's
all.
as
a
consequence,
the
follow-on
argument,
which
is
made
by
the
government,
that
this
is
somehow
a
violation
of
the
chenery
doctrine,
we
believe
is
an
erroneous
reading
of
what
happens.
what
the
court
does
under
the
clearly
erroneous
test
is
say
that,
you
don't
have
enough
evidence,
and
the
case
is
remanded
back.
it
does
not
make
its
own
findings.
and
therefore,
that
terminology
has
no
weight
or
holding
in
terms
of
reaching
this
result.
finally,
we
would
point
out
that
as
a
matter
of
policy,
the
federal
circuit
has
made
it
clear
that
consistency
between
review
directly
to
it
under
section
141
from
the
patent
office,
and
review
to
it
through
the
district
court
ought
to
have
the
same
standard,
that
congress
in
1982
made
it
clear
that
uniformity
in
the
patent
law
and
its
application
was
an
important
value,
and
that
it,
along
with
the
administrative
procedure
act's
desire
to
strengthen
the
quality
of
review
and
the
standard
of
practice
ought
to
be
approved.
mr.
ernest
gellhorn
there
is
no
basis,
we
believe,
in
terms
of
applying
that
under
the
administrative
procedure
act,
simply
because
in
this
instance
we
have,
again,
a
long-standing
practice...
they
acknowledge
that...
from
going
all
the
way
back
to
1894,
because
the
decision
in
morgan
v.--
