unknown
speaker
can
i
interrupt
you,
mr.
wallace,
and
i
know
you
don't
care
for
that
very
much,
but
let
me
do
it
anyway.
[laughter]
let's
talk
about
the
standard
of
the
scope
of
review
under
the
statute,
706,
which
says
that
under
the
apa
the
reviewing
court
will
hold
unlawful
agency
action
found
to
be
arbitrary,
capricious,
an
abuse
of
discretion
or
otherwise
not
in
accordance
with
law,
subsection
(a).
now
i
would
have
thought
that
was
the
standard
that
we
would
be
talking
about.
somehow
the
government,
having
espoused
that
for
years,
has
now
backed
off,
says
no,
it's
under
(e),
unsupported
by
substantial
evidence
in
a
case
subject
to
sections
556
and
557
of
this
title
or
otherwise
reviewed
on
the
record
of
an
agency
hearing
provided
by
statute.
i
don't
see
how
(e)
applies
to
this
situation.
now,
is
the
government
espousing
that
or
what?
i
mean,
it's
very
peculiar
and
i'd
like
you
to
speak
to
that
for
a
minute,
if
you
would.
unknown
speaker
well,
why
aren't
you
arguing
that
it's
required
under
the
statute?
i
don't
see
how
(e)
covers
this
situation--
unknown
speaker
--that
doesn't
mean--
unknown
speaker
--mr.
wallace,
i
thought
the
distinction
was,
indeed,
i
wrote
a
law
review
article
on
this--
[laughter]
--in
the
days
when
i
knew
something
about
administrative
law.
i
thought
that
the
distinction
is
that
the
arbitrary-capricious
standard,
the
first
standard,
applies
to
all
determinations,
determinations
of
policy,
determinations
of
fact
that
are
not
based
on
a
closed
record
and
so
forth,
and
that
the
substantial
evidence
test
is
merely
one
instance
of
what
constitutes
arbitrary
or
capricious
action
when
you
are...
when
you
are
making
a
determination
on
a
closed
record.
that
is
to
say,
if
you
have
a
closed
record
and
there
is
not
even
substantial
evidence
in
that
record
to
support
your
factual
determination,
substantial
evidence
being
the
amount
of
evidence
that
would
take
a
jury
case
to
the
jury,
if
you
don't
have
that,
it
has
to
be
arbitrary
or
capricious
anyway.
but
this
is
just
a
specification
of
what
arbitrariness
and
capriciousness
consists
of
with
regard
to
fact-finding
on
a
closed
record.
unknown
speaker
thank
you.
unknown
speaker
well,
good,
if
you
agree,
fine--
unknown
speaker
--if
you
agree,
then
we
come
back
to
the
question
that
was
asked
about
whether
or
not
the
proceeding
before
the
patent
office
is
a
proceeding
on
a
record.
i
always
thought...
now
you
get
50
law
professors
in
administrative
law,
you'll
get
50
different
views,
but
i
thought
that
a...
this
court
is
not
a
court
of
record.
a
court
of
appeals
is
not
a
court
of
record.
a
district
court
is
a
court
of
record.
there
is
a
stenographer
there
who
takes
down
the
record,
which
we
do
not
go
outside
of.
is
this
hearing
before
the
patent
office
a
proceeding
of
record?
i
doubt
it.
i
very
much
doubt
it.
certainly
i
could
find
nothing
that
supports
that
it
is.
rather,
it's
like
any
other
agency
proceeding,
say,
informal
rulemaking,
where
of
course
you
review
it
in
a
court
of
appeals,
informal
rulemaking
on
the
record
before
the
agency,
but
it
was
not
in
the
sense
of
556,
557,
or
what
i
think
is
a
second
clause
here,
not
record
in
that
sense.
so
you
can
explain
to
me,
what
is
this
proceeding
like
before
the
patent
office.
it
didn't
sound
like
any
record
proceeding
i've
ever
heard
of.
unknown
speaker
do
they
keep
that...
does
the
stenographer's
thing
all
kept
and
nobody
can...
there's
like
a...
like
a
district
court
record,
is
that
what
it
looks
like?
unknown
speaker
but
when
they
do
have
oral
proceedings,
when
somebody
goes
in
and
talks
to
that
examiner,
is
there
a
stenographer
present,
or
the
equivalent
thereof,
that
keeps
this
record
which
is
then
official?
unknown
speaker
it
says
on
the
record
before
the
patent--
unknown
speaker
--you're
going
to
sweep
all...
you'll
sweep
in
informal
rulemaking
in
general,
then,
and
you'll
suddenly
have
the
substantial
evidence
standard
applying
to...
to--
unknown
speaker
--550...
i
understand
that.
but
i
mean,
on
your
definition
of
what
(e)
is,
you're
suddenly
going
to
get
the
substantial
evidence
standard
applying
in
a
host
of
informal
rulemaking
proceedings
reviewed
by
the...
by
the
d.c.
circuit.
that's
what
i'd
worry
about,
about
taking
that--
unknown
speaker
--well,
mr.--
--but
of
course,
it
doesn't
matter,
as
you
agreed,
since
the
substantial
evidence
test
is
simply
a
version
of
the
arbitrary
or
capricious
test,
that
any
case
that
doesn't
have
even
that
minimum
of
substantial
evidence
to
get
you
to
the
jury,
and
is
decided
that
way,
has
to
be
arbitrary
or
capricious.
so
it
really
doesn't
matter,
does
it,
whether
we're
talking
about
(e)
or
(a).
unknown
speaker
well,
if
we'll...
if
we
get
over
that
hurdle
and
can
conclude
it
doesn't
matter,
would
you
enlighten
us
on
one
other
thing.
i
guess
the
c.
a.
fed.
applies
a
clear
error
standard.
is
that
the
standard
they
articulate?
unknown
speaker
and
i
always
thought
maybe
that
was
a...
a
standard
that
was
more
generous,
really,
to
the
agency
finding.
i
mean,
we're
not
going
to
upset
it
unless
it's
clearly
erroneous.
and
all
of
a
sudden
they're
telling
us
that
that's
more
stringent
than
a
substantial
evidence
standard.
would
you--
unknown
speaker
--explain
that
to
me?
unknown
speaker
yeah.
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
well,
if
you'd...
if
you'd
take
our
opinion
in
u.s.
gypsum,
which
was
many,
many
years
ago,
but
there
the
court
said,
i
think,
that
clearly
erroneous
gives
the
court
more
latitude
than
enough
evidence
to
go
to
the
jury.
it
said,
although
there's
enough
evidence
to
support
the
verdict,
the
court
is
convinced
that
a
mistake
was
made,
and
isn't
that
basically
what
we're
talking
about
here?
unknown
speaker
mr.
wallace,
although
that's
true
as
to
the
current
members
of
that
court,
is
it
not
possible
that
justice
o'connor's
suggestion
would
apply
to
the
use
of
clear
error,
those
words,
in
all
the
cases
decided
before
1947?
unknown
speaker
well,
it
was
well
settled...
well
settled,
wasn't
it,
that
if
the
patent
examiners
were
not
in
agreement,
did
not
concur,
the
predecessor
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
federal
circuit
would
give
a
very
searching
analysis
of
the
record.
unknown
speaker
and
so
they
were
consistent
in
that,
at
least,
but
they
were
not
consistent,
we
all
know,
in
the
words
they
used.
unknown
speaker
but
that's
not...
it
seems
to
me
that
that's
fatal
to
your
case.
i
mean,
you
are
asking
us
to
apply
a
provision
which
makes
an
exception
to
the
normal
apa
requirements,
where
there
are
additional
requirements
imposed
by
statute
or
otherwise
recognized
by
law.
now,
when
you
say,
by
law,
i'm
prepared
to
acknowledge
at
least
for
the
sake
of
argument
that
by
law
doesn't
mean
just
by
statute,
that
it
can
mean
by
practice.
but
it
seems
to
me
it
must
be
such
a
consistent
and
clear
practice
that
it
has
the
same
kind
of
uniformity
and
force
as
a
provision
in
a
statute,
and
i--
unknown
speaker
--but
you
say
it's
one
way
when
there
are
dissenting
opinions
in
the
board,
it
may
be
another
way
in
another
case,
that
they
may
have
been
using
clearly
erroneous
to
mean
the
same
thing
as
substantial
evidence
in
some
cases.
it
doesn't
seem
to
me
to
have
the
kind
of
clarity
that...
that
this
expression,
by
law,
requires.
unknown
speaker
or
either--
--yes,
you're
right.
i...
i'm
coming
down
on
the
wrong
person
here.
unknown
speaker
well,
this
will
give
them
time
to--
[laughter]
this
will
give
them
time
to
think
about
it.
mr....
mr.
wallace--
--let
me
ask
you
a
question.
--i
don't
agree
for
this
reason.
clear
error
is
the
standard
if
we
went
from
the
pto
to
the
district
court,
right?
and
then--
unknown
speaker
--and
then
the
federal
circuit
is
reviewing...
so,
you
have
one
mode
of
review
where
undoubtedly
the
standard
is
clear
error
and
my
thinking
is,
if
there
is
any
doubt,
why
should
the
standard
vis-a-vis
the
federal
circuit
be
different
if
you
come
to
it
through
another
court,
and
one
would
think
that
you've
had
an
extra
layer
of
review,
that
the
federal
circuit
at
that
point
should
be
more,
not
less
deferential.
but
if
you
go
from
the
district
court,
you
get
clear
error
and,
if
you
go
from
the
agency,
you
tell
us
you
get
arbitrary
and
capricious
or
substantial
evidence.
unknown
speaker
well,
then
you're
suggesting
that
it's
really
the
would-be
patentee's
choice,
because
the
patentee
could
say,
district
court,
look
at
the
record
from
the
pto,
but
i'm
going
to
put
in
some
other
things.
so--
unknown
speaker
--i
don't
understand
what
your
position
is
as
to
what
the
district
court
should
do,
if
the
person
does
go
the
district.
you
say,
if
no
additional
evidence
is
submitted,
you
use
the
substantial
evidence
test,
but
if
any
additional...
one
scrap
of
additional
evidence
is
submitted,
then
you
review
everything
de
novo
and
use
a
clearly
erroneous--
unknown
speaker
--you
use
substantial
evidence.
unknown
speaker
so
you
have
two
standards.
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
if
you
see
that
the
price
at
the
end
of
the
line
is
a
patent,
you
might
be
willing
to
put
up
that
money.
and
you
have
said
something
that
hadn't
occurred
to
me
before.
when
i
looked
at
this
complex
i
said,
well,
gee,
this
favors
the
rich,
because
you
go
to
district
court,
if
you
can
afford
the
time
and
the
money,
otherwise
you
go
to
federal
circuit,
which
is
faster
and
less
expensive
if
you
go
there
directly,
but
you
said
that
you
face
a
risk
in
the
district
court
that
you
wouldn't
face
before
the
federal
circuit.
unknown
speaker
it's
not
simply...
i
had
thought
of
the
model
with
the
tax
court
and
the
deficiency
you
can't
pay
up,
so
you
go
that
route,
and
it's
not
because
of
a
greater
risk
or
something,
it's
just,
i
don't
have
the
money.
unknown
speaker
it's
a
strange...
i'm
unaware
of
any
other
case
where
you
have
a
court
that
takes
evidence,
yet
which
is
not
reviewing
it
de
novo.
you're
saying
when
they
take
evidence
they
don't
make
the
decision
de
novo.
they
just
apply
a
clearly
erroneous
standard
instead
of
a
substantial
evidence
standard.
that's
very
strange.
unknown
speaker
oh.
well,
then
that's
not
a
clearly
erroneous
standard.
that's--
unknown
speaker
--it's
totally...
it's
their
call.
unknown
speaker
and
then
it
would
be
reviewed
on
appeal
de
novo
in
a
federal...
i
can
see--
unknown
speaker
--mr.
wallace,
if
we...
if
we
were
to
adopt
the
respondents'
and
the
c.
a.
fed.
's
position,
would
it
have
destabilizing
or
uncertain
effects
in
other
areas
of
administrative
law?
when
i
began
looking
at
the
briefs,
i
thought,
well,
the
government
will
give
me
a
parade
of
horribles.
i
didn't
find
one.
is
this
really
a...
an
issue
that's
unique
to
the
case
before
us
and
it's
not
going
to
have
much
more
far-reaching
effect
if
we
adopt
the
c.a.
fed.
position?
or--
unknown
speaker
--well,
the
argument
that
they're
making
is
that
it
doesn't
displace
it.
i
mean,
when
you
have
a
higher
standard
it...
it
accepts
the
lower
standard
and
goes
beyond
the
lower
standard.
i
mean,
the
clearly
err...
you
know,
the
clearly
erroneous
test
embraces
the
substantial
evidence
test
and
goes
further.
i
mean--
unknown
speaker
--well,
i
don't
think
that's
correct
entirely,
mr.
wallace.
if
the
purpose
of
the
apa
was
to
kind
of
straighten
out
some
rather
confused
doctrines
and
make
sure
there
was...
that
the
agencies
had
to
have
at
least
a
certain
amount
of
evidence
to
sustain,
then
if
there
was
a
practice
in
some
other
agency
that
said,
we
require
even
a
higher
agency,
it
seems
to
me
that
isn't
inconsistent.
unknown
speaker
do
you
agree--
unknown
speaker
--do
you
agree,
mr.
wallace,
that
the
cases
that
respondents
cite
in
their
brief
are
a
fair
sample
of
the
pre-apa
patent
cases,
as
far
as
whether
this
standard
was
actually
applied?
unknown
speaker
well,
what
other
cases
do
you
think
are
relevant
that
they
haven't
pointed
out?
because
i...
the
hard
question
for
me
is
whether
this
was
indeed
a
practice.
i
mean,
maybe
the
other...
i
don't
even
get
to
the
other
questions
and...
and--
unknown
speaker
--can
i
rely
on
the
cases
they've
set
forth
in
here?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
thought
they
said
that
the
phrasing
might
have
been
uncertain,
but
the
practice
was
consistent.
that's
the
way
i
understood
their
opinion.
unknown
speaker
well,
mr.
wallace,
we
can
ask
them
what
they
said,
but
let
me
ask
you
this
question.
it's...
you
talked
about
the
apa
and
the
importance
of
uniformity,
and
i
understand
the
model:
agency
that
knows
a
lot
about
one
field,
generalist
court
that
is
exercising
review.
but
we
have
something
peculiar
here
in
that
congress
has
designated
this
court
as
the
patent
specialist.
these
cases
don't
go
generally
to
the
courts
of
appeals
that...
so--
unknown
speaker
--yes,
but
there
is
an
expertise...
forgive
me...
expertness
in
that
court
that...
even
in
the
staffing,
and
the
congress
did
that
deliberately
and
said,
patent's
going
to
be
one
of
your
main--
unknown
speaker
--so
it's
not...
at
least--
unknown
speaker
--all
i'm
attempting
to
say
is,
it
isn't
the
standard
agency
with
know-how
in
a
particular
area,
generalist
court,
which
is
what
i
think
congress
had
in
mind
in
the
forties
when
the
apa
was
written.
unknown
speaker
very
well,
mr.
wallace.
mr.
gellhorn,
we'll
hear
from
you.
unknown
speaker
mr.
gellhorn,
may
i
just
on
that
very
point,
because
this
is...
i
have
the
same
concern
justice
scalia
does,
of
how
clearly
established
was
the
rule
on
which
you
rely.
and
the
government...
i
want
to
be...
in
their
reply
brief,
say
you
cite
36
cases,
that
all
of
them
affirm
the
examiner,
except
four,
and
that
three
of
those
were...
they
applied
de
novo
review,
and
the
fourth
they
applied
also
an
erroneous
standard.
have
they
fairly
summarized
those
cases?
unknown
speaker
but
in
those...
in
that
number,
were
there
more
that...
where
they
reversed
the
patent
examiner?
unknown
speaker
but
how
can
we
really
make
a
judgment
about
that
consistency
without
literally
going
back
and
examining
the
record
in
every
one
of
those
cases,
which
we
clearly
can't
do?
i
mean,
if
we
had
terminology
that
was
clear
and
consistently
used,
it
would
be
easy
for
us,
comparatively.
but
to
say,
well,
the
terminology
really
is
not
the
primary
evidence
here,
practice
is,
that's
a
pretty
tough
standard
for
me
to
be
able
to
handle.
how
do
i
do
it?
unknown
speaker
but
may
i
just
clarify
one
thing.
do
you
think
the
clear
error
as
used
in
those
terms
is
the
functional
equivalent
of
clearly
erroneous
as
we've
since
used
it?
unknown
speaker
and
has
the...
was
the
term
clearly
erroneous
used
in
any
of
those
terms...
cases?
unknown
speaker
they
did.
unknown
speaker
you
know
this--
unknown
speaker
--well,
would
you
answer
the
same
question
i
asked
mr.
wallace.
in
common
parlance,
we
would
think
a
clearly
erroneous
standard
was
not
as
strict
a
standard
as
substantial
evidence.
unknown
speaker
do
you
have
any
case
that...
from
the
board
that
makes
it
clear
that
that's
the...
that
there
is
a
difference
between
their
clearly
erroneous
test
and
substantial
evidence?
i
mean,
that...
it's
the
dog
that
didn't
bark
that
gives
me
the
trouble.
once
the
apa
was
adopted,
you
would
have
thought
that
if
they
were
going
along
with
a
different
standard,
somebody
would
have
said,
hey,
we
know
the
a...
it
was
clear
they
were
governed
by
the
apa.
you
would
have
thought
somebody
would
have
said,
well,
of
course,
the
apa
has
a
substantial
evidence
test,
but
we're
applying
the
good
old...
the
good
old
clearly
erroneous.
you'd
think
somebody
would
have
noted
it,
whereas,
in
fact,
they
just
go
on
talking
the
same
way,
as
though
as
far
as
they're
aware,
substantial
evidence
and
clearly
erroneous,
you
know,
tweedle-dum,
tweedle-dee.
unknown
speaker
why
did
everybody
assume
that?
because
they
focused
on
this
obscure
provision,
which
we've
been
debating
about,
you
know,
whether
it's
additional
and
so
forth?
did
anybody
ever
mention
it?
unknown
speaker
but
it
is
odd,
because
your
approach
basically
tells
us,
well,
the
apa
just
sets
a
minimum
standard,
and
any
other
standard
that's
more,
well,
then
that
applies.
and
do
you
think
people
in
general
thought
that
the
apa
was
just
setting
up
some
kind
of
minimum
standards
here,
and--
unknown
speaker
--but
we
have
no
case
where
you
can
show
us
that
it
really
would
make
a
big
difference
in
any
particular
appeal.
i
mean,
we
don't...
i
don't
have
a
sense
for
whether
it
matters.
unknown
speaker
mr.
gellhorn,
i...
apart
from
this
case,
where
the
federal
circuit
said
to...
said
to
this
court,
we
want
you
to
tell
us
which
standard
is
right
and
we're
telling
you
that
this
case
is
going
to
come
out
differently
if
we
apply
the
more
deferential
substantial
evidence
than
if
we
apply
the
slightly
more
stringent
clearly
erroneous
test.
but
i
never
saw
a
court
of
appeals
doing
that
before,
saying
the
standard
of
review
is
not
just
some
thing
that
we...
a
button
that
we
push,
but
that
it
really,
in
this
case,
it's
going
to
come
out
differently.
is
there
any
other
case
where
a
court
of
appeals
has
said
that?
unknown
speaker
in
answer,
or
further
exploration
of
justice
souter's
question
about
what
are
we
supposed
to
do
in
determining
what
the
earlier
practice
was,
can
we
say
at
least
that
the
patent
bar
is
in
general
agreement
that,
a)
the
standard
makes
a
difference,
and
b)
the
reviewing
courts
and
the
court
of
appeals
have
been
consistent
in
using
the
strict
standard?
is
that
a
fair
characterization
of
the
briefs
or
is
the
patent
bar
somewhat
more
divided
than
that?
unknown
speaker
do
you
know
any
bar
that
would
not
favor
a
more
liberal
standard
of
review?
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
of
course
not.
unknown
speaker
we
do
have
a
case
we
decided
in
1966,
consolo
v.
federal
maritime
commission,
in
which
the
court
said
that
any
standard
other
than
substantial
evidence
was
inconsistent
with
the
apa.
now,
it
didn't
address
the
question
of
what
the
federal
maritime
commission's
practice
had
been.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
suppose
it
would
make
a
difference
to
whether
the
standard
were
more
demanding
or
less
demanding
than
that
set
forth
in
the
apa.
if
you
think
of
the
apa
as
having
been
enacted
to,
you
know,
considered...
substantial
evidence
considered
on
the
record
as
a
whole,
when
the...
this
court
in
one
case
said,
i
think,
all
you
had
to
look
at
was
the
side
that
favored
the
party
that
won
before
the
agency.
unknown
speaker
and
the
act
was
the
product
of
the...
of
the
bar
associations
who
liked
greater
review
of
agency
actions,
rather
than--
unknown
speaker
--your
namesake.
unknown
speaker
do
you
think--
--mr.
gellhorn,
do
you
agree
with
mr.
wallace's
information
about
the
district
court,
when
one
chooses
those
routes
it's
not
simply
a
matter
of
time
and
money,
but
that
the
would-be
patentee
faces
a
risk
of
expanding
the
record
against
him
in
the
district
court,
and
that
would
be
reason
not
to
go
that
way.
unknown
speaker
but
at
least
you
agree
that
people
seldom
use
the
district
court
route.
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
you
two
questions,
though
each
very
brief.
is
there
a
procedure
before
the
board
of
patent
appeals
whereby
the
applicant
can
supplement
the
record
at
all,
or
is
it
always
on
what...
precisely
what
was
before
the
examiner?
unknown
speaker
i
see.
unknown
speaker
i
see.
now,
the
second
question
i
had,
would
you
have
a
comment
on...
one
of
the
briefs
i
remember
quoted
caspar
ooms
as
saying,
in
effect,
the
government's
right.
do
you
have
a...
he
was
pretty
familiar
with
this
area
of
the
law,
as
i
remember
him.
you
know
who
i'm
talking
about,
caspar
ooms?
unknown
speaker
yeah.
one
of
the
briefs...
i
don't
have
it
in
front
of
me...
quoted
him
as
saying
that
the
apa
did
not
change
the
standard
of
review
on
review
of
patent
applications.
unknown
speaker
but,
of
course,
those
comments
were
made
before
the
decision
in
the
gypsum
case,
where
we
really
spelled
out
what
clearly
erroneous
means.
unknown
speaker
well,
of
course,
that's...
that's
what
we're
all...
that's
the
big...
that's
really
the
issue.
unknown
speaker
what
is
your
response
to
justice
o'connor's
initial
question?
i'd
always
thought,
but
hadn't
thought
about
it
too
much,
that
the
second
clause
of
706(e)
means...
there
are
loads...
you
know,
there
are
loads...
they're
basically
referring
to
a
case
where
a
statute
requires
a
decision
after
a
hearing
on
a
record.
the
statute
requires
that.
some
such
cases
fall
within
556,
557,
some
do
not.
they
fall
within
exception
to
554,
or
there
are
various
exceptions
throughout
556,
557.
but
this
says,
in
any
case
where
a
statute
requires
a
decision
after
a
hearing
on
a
record,
you
must
have
substantial
evidence.
i
mean,
that's
all
it
means.
now,
if
that's
so,
then
i
take
it,
it
wouldn't
apply
here?
unknown
speaker
all
right,
then
we
would
be
under
arbitrary-capricious,
which
in
my
opinion,
but
maybe
not
yours,
would
make
a
difference.
that
is
to
say,
that,
itself...
i
don't
know
quite
how
to
treat
it,
then,
because
that,
itself,
i
would
think
would
give
the
agency
greater
leeway
to
determine
where
the
agency
is
expert,
and
where
the
board
that
it's
reviewing
is
expert.
it
might
well.
it
might
well
have
greater
leeway
to
overturn
an
agency
decision,
being
not
arbitrary,
than
it
would
were
it
technically
to
apply
substantial
evidence
on
the
record
as
a
whole.
i
don't
know
how
you
think...
what
you
think
about
that.
unknown
speaker
all
right.
but
then
if
that's
so,
then
i
think
we're
in...
we're
in
arbitrary-capricious.
and
once
we're
in
arbitrary-capricious,
i'm
not
sure
where
to
go,
because
it's
quite
possible
that
what
they
do
right
now
falls
well
within
arbitrary-capricious.
i
mean,
all
they're
saying,
basically,
is,
we
know
more
about
these
agencies
than
the
typical
court
knows
about
a
typical
agency
and,
therefore,
we
will
be
a
little
tougher
on
them.
that's
fine.
it
might
be
fine
under
substantial
evidence,
but
i
would
think
it
would
be
fine
under
arbitrary-capricious.
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
arbitrary
and
capricious
is
the
same
as
clearly
erroneous?
unknown
speaker
no?
no.
so
you'd
still
have
to
engage
in
the...
in
the--
--yes,
but
it
was
a
different...
it
would
give
them
more
flexibility
to
be
tougher.
it
would
give
them...
and
after
all,
we're
dealing
with
shades
here,
what
cardozo
called
a
shadowland,
that
probably
has
no
reality,
which
is
my--
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
that
was
certainly
the
federal
circuit's
understanding,
because
as
i
remember...
and
maybe
i
remember
incorrectly...
they
weren't
dealing
with
the
substantial
evidence.
they
compared
two
standards.
one
was
called
arbitrary
and
capricious.
unknown
speaker
they
said,
as
we
understand
that
standard--
unknown
speaker
--it
doesn't
give
us
as
much
control
over
the
pto
as...
so
at
least
the
federal
circuit
was
clear
about
what
it
thought
the
labels
meant.
and
it
said,
if
we
have
a
slightly
more
stringent
clearly
erroneous
review,
then
we
can
exercise
more
control
over
the
pto
than
we
could
if
the
standard
were
arbitrary
and
capricious.
unknown
speaker
because
i
think
justice
breyer's
question
was
suggesting,
well,
they're
really
the
same.
and
the
whole
thrust
of
the
federal
circuit's
opinion
is,
no,
they're
not.
it
makes
a
difference.
we
want
clear
error
because
it
gives
us
a
little
more
control
over
this
agency
than
we
would
have
if
all
we
had
was
arbitrary
and
capricious.
unknown
speaker
how
is
it
possible
that
a
quantum
of
evidence
which
is
not
enough
to
take
a
case
to
the
jury
would
not
be
arbitrary
and
capricious?
how
is--
unknown
speaker
--ah.
i
thought
you
were
comparing
substantial
evidence
with
arbitrary
and
capricious.
unknown
speaker
i
agree
that
clearly
erroneous
is
higher
than
both
arbitrary
and
capricious
and
substantial
evidence.
i
tend
to
think
that
arbitrary
and
capricious
and
substantial
evidence,
however,
are
identical,
and
that
the
point
of
(e)
is
simply
that
the...
that
the
substantial
evidence
has
to
be
in
the
record.
unknown
speaker
do
you
also...
do
you...
in
my
experience
in
20
years
of
being
a
judge,
30
of
teaching
administrative
law,
and
three
editions
of
the
case
book,
i
have
never
found
a
case
in
which
somebody
would
say,
this
would
be
affirmed
if
it
were
substantial
evidence,
but
not
if
it's
clearly
erroneous
or
the
contrary.
i
did
find
one
case
by
judge
leventhal,
who
thought
he
had
found
that
particular
snark
that
he
had
hunted.
[laughter]
and
yet,
he
said
on
conclusion,
i
have
to
agree,
i'd
come
out
the
same
way,
either
standing?
i
mean,
is
that
your
experience
as
well,
this
makes
no
practical
difference
whatsoever?
unknown
speaker
but
those
figures...
that
they've
rejected
48,000
out
of
200,000?
unknown
speaker
gee,
they
grant
a
lot
of
patents,
don't
they.
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
i
would
read
it
the
other
way
around.
unknown
speaker
well,
not
by
this
route,
they
don't.
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
what
is
the
word
you're
referring
to?
unknown
speaker
what
is
it?
our
reasoning.
unknown
speaker
well,
it
was
a
little
odd.
i
mean,
the
c.
a.
fed.
seemed
to
say,
we're
not
going
to
analyze
the
reasoning
of
the
court
of
patent
appeals.
we're
just
going
to
look
at
our
own.
i
thought
it
was
very
peculiar.
unknown
speaker
but
mr.
wallace
says
that
it's
your
theory
that
would
destroy
the
consistency,
because
he
says
the
district
court
ought
to
be
applying
a
substantial
evidence
test
when
there's
no
additional
evidence
introduced.
what
is
your
response
to
that?
unknown
speaker
i
think
you've
answered
the
question,
mr.
gellhorn.
mr.
wallace,
you
have
one
minute
remaining.
unknown
speaker
but
although
the
court
of
appeals
thought
differently.
unknown
speaker
you
know,
i
mean,
i
have
the...
i
have
real
difficulty--
unknown
speaker
but
i
thought
they
also
said
that
they
used
different
word
formulas,
but
in
any
case
the
thrust
was
a
little
tighter
than
arbitrary
and
capricious.
unknown
speaker
the
honorable
court
is
now
adjourned
until
monday
next
at
ten
o'clock.
