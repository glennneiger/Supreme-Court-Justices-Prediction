mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
question
in
this
case
is
whether
the
standards
of
judicial
review
specified
by
the
administrative
procedure
act
apply
to
the
federal
circuit's
review
of
decisions
of
the
patent
and
trademark
office's
board
of
patent
appeals
and
interferences
rejecting
claims
of
unsuccessful
patent
applicants.
the
en
banc
court
of
appeals
held
that
those
standards
do
not
apply,
but
neither
that
court
nor
the
respondents
contend
that
by
their
terms
these
detailed
provisions
of
the
administrative
procedure
act...
neither
of
them
contest
that
by
their
terms
they
would
directly
apply
and
would
prescribe
review
of
the
board's
factual
findings
under
the
substantial
evidence
standard
set
forth
in
section
706(2)(e)
of
title
5,
set
forth
on
page
5
of
our
brief.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
one
does
not
preclude
the
other.
we
would
not
say
that
agency
action
should
be
upheld
if
it's
arbitrary,
capricious,
or
an
abuse
of
discretion.
we're
not
arguing
that
that
standard
is
precluded.
we--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--(e)...
we
think
(e)
comes
in
because
under
the
patent
code,
the
court
of
appeals
is
reviewing
these
determinations
of
the
board
on
the
record
before
the
board.
the
patent
code
specifies
that
review
in
the
court
of
appeals
is
to
be
on
the
administrative
record,
and
while
these
are
not
hearings
subject
to
sections
556
and
557
of
the
act,
they
are
in
our
view,
and
we
conceded
before
the
en
banc
court,
otherwise
reviewed
on
the
record
of
an
agency
hearing
provided
by
statute.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
the
board
proceedings
are
provided
for
in
the
patent
code,
and--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--i
agree
entirely--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--and
i
wish
i
could've
put
it
as
well--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--and
i'd
amend
my
answer
to
justice
o'connor.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
the...
there
is
a
record
compiled
based
on
what
the
applicant
and
the
examiner
submit
to
the
board.
this
is
review
of
the
examiner's
decision
and
the
statute
does
require
when
review
is
sought
in
the
federal
circuit
that
that
record
be
transmitted
by
the
commissioner
to
the
federal
circuit.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
there
isn't
always
an
oral
hearing.
sometimes
it's
submitted
on
the
papers,
but
the
record
is
compiled
so
as
to
enable
the
board
to
trans--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--i...
i
could
not
say,
justice
breyer.
what
i...
what
we
are
relying
on
is
that
the
patent
code
specifies
that
review
in
the
court
of
appeals,
when
appeal
is
taken
to
the
court
of
appeals--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--has
to
be
on
the
record
and
the
preceding
section
says
that
the
commissioner
is
required
to
transmit
the
record.
so
the
record
that
has
been
compiled,
which
would
be
the
record
that
the
board
based
its
decision
on,
is
the
record
to
which
this
review
proceeding
is
confined,
and
that
is
the
basis
on
which
we
would
say
that
this
is
a...
otherwise
reviewed
on
the
record
of
an
agency,
provided
by
statute.
we
thought...
provided
by
statute
refers
to
the
review
was
to
be
on
the
record,
even
though
it
is
not--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--well,
this
is
not
rulemaking.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
i...
we
would
not
go
that
far.
we're...
we're
dealing
here
with
what
amounts
to
a
form
of
rejection
of
a
particular
applicant's
claim,
an
adjudication
of
the
particular
claim.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
i
think
for
purposes
of
the
present
case
it
does
not.
the
court--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--well,
they--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--that--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--that
has
been
the
reaction
of
a
number
of
lawyers
not
familiar
with
this
long-standing
controversy
that...
they...
when
i
tell
them
what
the
issue
is
in
this
case...
or
at
least
they
want
to
know,
well,
which
is
the
more
deferential--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--standard.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
what
counts
for
purposes
of
this
case,
since
this
is
a
determination
of
what...
of
how
review
should
proceed
in
the
federal
circuit,
is
the
understanding
of
the
federal
circuit
about
the
difference
between
the
two
standards
and
why
they're
choosing
one
standard
rather
than
the
other,
and
they
explain
that,
i
think
quite
candidly,
in
the
en
banc
opinion
that
they
were
insisting
on
what
we
would
term
a
more
intrusive,
less
deferential
standard
where
they
can
proceed
on
their
own
reasoning
rather
than
in
compliance
with
the
standards
of
the
administrative
procedure
act,
which
would
require
them
to
determine
the
case
not
on
the
basis
of
their
own
interpretation
of
the
record
transmitted
to
them,
but
on
the
basis
of
whether
the
board's
reasoning
was
justifiable
as
not
arbitrary
or
capricious--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--that...
i
think
that
is
precisely
the
concept
of
the
en
banc
court,
that
they
have
more
leeway
to
make
their
own
determinations
that
otherwise
they
would--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--well,
that
certainly
is
a
way
of
looking
at
them.
those
cases,
as...
as
we
explain
in
our
reply
brief,
do
not
sharply
differentiate
between
the
two
standards
of
review
that
we
have
under
discussion
in
this
case.
they
will
juxtapose
a
sentence
about
clear
error
with
a
sentence
or
two
about
the
propriety
of
def...
of
deferring
to
the
technical
expertise
of
the
board
in
this
kind
of
proceeding.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that...
that
was
true--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--the
en
banc
court
said
that
until
the
early
fifties,
at
least,
the
ccpa
as
it
was
called,
the
court
of
customs
and
patent
appeals,
had
disparate
approaches
to
review.
what--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--but
that
was
our
contention,
precisely.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
that's
the...
the
other
side
is
arguing
that
it
has
that
kind
of
clarity.
i...
we're
taking
the
position
that
this
was
not
recognized...
another
requirement
recognized
by
law
within
the
meaning
of
this
provision,
section
559,
or...
the
original
section
12--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--right.
[laughter]
again,
i
agree
with
you
entirely.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
right.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
when
you
say
get
clear
error,
it
depends
on
what
you're
talking
about.
clear
error
is
the
standard
of
review
by
the
court
of
appeals
of
the
district
court's
factual
findings
when
the
district
court
has
heard
evidence
on
its
own,
but
the
case
law,
and
there's
not
a
great
deal
of
it,
does
indicate
that
when
you
go
from
the
pto
to
the
district
court
and
don't
ask
the
district
court
to
make
findings
on
its
own,
but
to
decide
it
on
the
basis
of
the
board's
record,
that
it's
then
a...
not
a
trial
de
novo.
but
we
would
argue
that
the
district
court,
too,
should
then
be
reviewing
under
the
apa
substantial
evidence
standard,
and
i
can
refer
the
court
to
two
cases
on
this
subject.
one
is
mckay
v.
quigg,
641
f.
supp.
567,
in
the
district
court
for
the
district
of
columbia,
at
page
569,
and
gould
v.
quigg,
822
f.
2d
1074.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
there
is
that
choice,
which
has
been
a
historical
choice
of
proceeding
by
a
bill
in
equity,
and
the
direct
review
proceeding
was
added
later
on.
the
great
bulk
of
applicants
choose
to
go
directly
to
the
federal
circuit.
it's
quite
risky
to
go
to
the
district
court,
because
it's
not
only
the
applicant
who
can
submit
additional
evidence;
it's
also
the
commissioner
who
can
submit
additional
evidence.
and
rather
than
deal
with
one
examiner
who
on
his
own
spent
an
average
of
two
days
looking
into
the
prior
art,
you
might
be
faced
with
a
team
of
lawyers
who've
prepared
the
case
with
great
care
and
have
brought
in
expert
witnesses
who
will
expose
much
more
of
the
prior
art
that
could
put
your
application
at
risk.
and--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--de
novo
as
to
claims
on
which
additional
evidence
is
put
in,
and
to
the
extent
both
parties
are
standing
on
the
record
that
was
made
before
the
board,
then
it's
review
of
the--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--right.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
it's
a
hybrid
proceeding,
is
what
those
cases
that
i
just
said
call
it.
but
i
just
wanted
to
finish
my
previous
answer,
and
the
last
sentence
of
35
u.s.c.
145
says
that
the
expenses
of
the
proceeding
will
be
borne
by
the
applicant,
all
the
expenses,
and
that
includes
the
expenses
of
the
commissioner's
expert
witnesses.
so
the
commissioner
can
bring
in--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--correct,
that
the
commissioner
will
expand
the
record
unless
they
are
adverse
to
the
applicant,
because
the
record
can
be
expanded
by
either
party,
whereas
the
applicant
is
in
much
greater
control
of
the
record
he's
been
making
in
the
administrative
proceedings,
which
are
basically
ex
parte,
and
there
are
also
ways
of
continuing
the
administrative
proceeding
and
then
reapplying
again
under
section
120.
so
the
great
bulk
of
review
is
sought
through
the
direct
route
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
federal
circuit.
and
there
are
reasons--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--right,
right.
i
really
learned
more
about
this
during
the
course
of
argument
preparation
in
talking
with
the
people
from
the
pto
and
the
disincentive
that
really
exists
for
many
applicants
to
use
the
district
court
proceeding.
it's
available.
it's
occasionally
used,
but--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--they
make
the
decision
de
novo
with
respect
to
any
matter
as
to
which
they've
taken
evidence.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that's
correct.
it's...
they
would
only--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--but
there
may
be--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--that
there
may
be
claims
as
to
which
neither
party
introduced
any
evidence
and
relied
solely
on
the
record
before
the
board.
that
would...
that
would
be
a
review
proceeding.
but
where
they
have
taken
evidence
from
either
party
that
was
not
in
the
board's
record
as
to
particular
claims,
then
those
claims
are
being
reviewed
de
novo
in
the
district
court,
and
the
court
of
appeals
applies
a
clearly
erroneous
standard
of
review
to
the
district
court's
findings
when
the
district
court
has
made
the
findings.
but
as
to
administrative
findings,
a
somewhat
more
deferential
standard
of
review
is
appropriate.
that
was
first
articulated
just
before...
3
months
before
the
adoption
of
the
administrative
procedure
act,
in
the
ooms
opinion
where
judge
edgerton
was
writing
a
great
deal
for
the...
on
this
subject
for
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
at
the
time,
and
made
that
distinction.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
we're
not
aware
of
active
litigation
which
has
raised
similar
claims
as
to
other
agencies,
but
it...
this
reading
of
section
559
certainly
could
raise
such
questions,
if
it
were
established,
as
is
certainly
not
clear
on
the
face,
that
requirements,
where
it's
used
five
other
times
in
the
original
section
12
clearly
to
mean
requirements
for
the
administrative
proceeding
itself,
or
the
conduct
of
the
administrative
proceeding,
could
also
refer
to
the
standard
of
judicial
review,
and
that
additional
could
mean
instead
of
the
standard
specified
by
the
act,
which
is
not
what
i
found
in
looking
at
a
number
of
dictionaries
about
the
meaning
of
additional,
which
means
supplementary,
but
not
to
displace
or
instead
of--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--but
it
is
contradictory
to
it,
and
it
is
a
situation
in
which
after
a
10-year
enterprise
in
formulating
the
administrative
procedure
act
to
bring
some
unity
and
coherence
to
bring
order
out
of
what,
if
not
chaos,
had
been
disarray,
the
savings
clause
would
be
read
in
a
way
to
really
contradict
the
effect...
the
effectiveness
of
that--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--a
practice
in
the
agency,
what
would
the...
certainly
an
example
of
what
would
be
something
comparable
to
a
statute
otherwise
required
by
law
would
be
an
agency
rule
that
did
not
contradict
a
statutory
requirement.
but
the
standard--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--of
review
really
doesn't
change
what
requirements
there
are
in
conducting
the
agency
proceeding.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
a
fair
sample
selectively
described,
because
many--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--well,
we--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--we
discussed
some
in
our
reply
brief,
and
we
generally
think
that
the
federal
circuit
very
candidly
and
accurately
described
the
state
of
the
law
as
being
ambiguous
and
as
having
what
they...
what
could
be
called
a
menu
of
standards
that
were
being
applied
and
selected
from,
and
they
say
any
of
these
are
recognized
by
law
within
the
meaning
of
this
provision.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
no,
they
said
it's
too
ambiguous
to...
to--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--it's
a
court
with
many
other
responsibilities
as
well.
the
author
of
the
panel
opinion
here
was
the
former
head
of
the
tax
division
in
the
justice
department.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
better
enables
them
to
perform--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--their
review
function.
it
doesn't
mean
they
should
step
into
the
shoes
of
the
agency
to
whom
congress
has
entrusted
the
decisionmaking.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
if
i
may
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
on
page
26a
of
the
petition
appendix,
the
court
of
appeals
en
banc,
after
reviewing
all
of
the
cases,
said
that
the
clearly
erroneous
was
simply
one
of
several
standards
discernible
from
the
case
law
prior
to
the
1947
enactment.
that
is
not
an
additional
requirement
otherwise
recognized
by
law
just
because
the
courts
were
acquainted
with
it
and
sometimes
applied
it.
that
is
not
the
kind
of
thing
that
should
override
the
specific
resolution
after
10
years
of
what
the
standard
of
judicial
review
should
be,
specified
in
the
administrative
procedure
act.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
they...
would
they--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--they
did
it
partly
on
the
basis
of
stare
decisis,
their
own
precedent
since
1982.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
they
conscientiously
looked
at
these
cases.
they
were
cited
to
them.
amici
appeared
before
them
in
the
en
banc
proceeding,
and
they
said
it
was
one
of
several
standards
being
used
before
'47.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
that...
not
exclusively.
they
said
including
clear
error
and
its
close
cousins.
