--i
have
real
difficulty
trying
to
figure
out
from
this
lofty
perch
whether
they
were
indeed
consistently
using
a
clearly
erroneous
test.
and
i
am
very
much
inclined
to,
if
i
can't
figure
it
out,
rely
on
the
judgment
of
the
people
down
there
who
deal
with
this
regularly
and
some
of
whom
have
sat
on
the
board.
