mr.
sidney
w.
jackson
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice
rehnquist,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
first,
to
set
the
record
straight
about
what
the
trial
court
said
about
applicable
alabama
law
in
this
diversity
case,
on
page
36
of
the
joint
appendix
the
court
discounted
the
attack
on
a
process
of
elimination
form
of
proof.
despite
defendants'
exhortations
to
the
contrary,
the
court
perceives
no
inherent
flaw
in
a
process
of
elimination
form
of
proof
per
se,
as
long
as
the
underlying
methodology
is
scientifically
valid.
under
alabama
law--
mr.
sidney
w.
jackson
--footnote
7.
mr.
sidney
w.
jackson
yes,
sir,
of
the
joint
appendix,
your
honor,
page
37,
footnote
7
in
the
court's
first
order.
mr.
sidney
w.
jackson
i'm
sorry,
judge...
justice...
mr.
justice
scalia,
page
36,
yes,
sir,
and
that
flows
from
the
hillhaven
farms
v.
sears
case,
which
interpreted
alabama
law
in
a
tire
failure
case
where
the
plaintiff
did
not
rule
out
abuse,
and
the
case
was
sent
back
in
order
that
the
plaintiff
could
do
such...
put
on
such
proof.
mr.
sidney
w.
jackson
your
honor,
the
substantive
alabama
law
would
be
applied
to
see
whether
or
not
we
have
presented
sufficient
proof
to
let
a
defect
go
to
the
jury.
mr.
sidney
w.
jackson
the
federal
rules
of
evidence,
of
course,
will
apply
on
what
evidence
comes
in
and
what
evidence
does
not
come
in,
so
it
would
be
the
federal
rules
of
evidence
who
make
procedural--
mr.
sidney
w.
jackson
--your
honor,
the
relevance
of
alabama
law
deals
directly
with
the
reliability
and
relevance
of
what
mr.
carlson
was
going
to
do
in
this
case.
mr.
sidney
w.
jackson
yes,
sir,
and
his
qualifications--
mr.
sidney
w.
jackson
--it
would
not,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
sidney
w.
jackson
because
the
petitioners
take
the
point,
or
take
the
standpoint
in
their
briefs
and
down
below
that
this
type
of
expert
testimony
cannot
lead
anywhere
in
the
context
of
the
facts
of
this
case,
and
certainly
his
testimony,
his
proffer
can,
because
we
know
that
if
abuse
is
ruled
out
as
the
cause
of
the
carmichaels'
tire
failure,
then
whether
or
not
the
tire
failed
due
to
a
defect
is
properly
an
issue
for
the
jury.
it's
a
question
of
fact.
and
here,
mr.
carlson
was
going
to
take
the
tire,
he
was
going
to
take
it
in
front
of
the
jury,
he
was
going
to
explain
that,
based
on
his
years
of
experience
at
michelin
in
watching
thousands
of
tires
fail
and
examining
the
carcass
of
those
tires,
that
there
would
be
four
signs,
objective
indicia
of
abuse,
and
he
would
show
where
those
signs
should
be,
and
he
would
point
to
the
sidewall
deterioration
and
show--
mr.
sidney
w.
jackson
--no,
your
honor,
he
could
not
guarantee
the
jury
that.
mr.
sidney
w.
jackson
well--
mr.
sidney
w.
jackson
--well,
justice
scalia--
mr.
sidney
w.
jackson
--yes,
your
honor,
but
this
is
not
a
production
burden
issue.
the
issue
here
is
whether
or
not
this
testimony
should
be
admitted
to
begin
with,
and
what
factors
the
court
should
or
should
not
look
at
in
determining
that
threshold
of
reliability
in
order
to
allow
him
to
testify,
because
what
mr.
carlson
is
going
to
do
is
to
take
a
fairly
mundane
object,
a
tire,
and
he
is
going
to
assist
the
jury
in
reading
that
tire.
mr.
sidney
w.
jackson
justice
scalia,
i
believe
the
record
will
show
that
mr.
carlson,
the
expert,
candidly
stated
that
he
cannot
point
to
the
specific
defect.
that
is
next
to
impossible
in
a
tire
failure
case.
but
what
he
can
do
is,
is
he
knows
to
look
for
certain
types
of
objective
indicia
to
rule
out
abuse
and
the
eleventh
circuit
cited
the--
mr.
sidney
w.
jackson
--then
i
misspoke.
mr.
sidney
w.
jackson
well,
he
stated
that
if
there
is
abuse,
there
are
four
common
signs
that
are
apparent
in
most
all
tires
that
fail
due
to
abuse,
and
most
tires
do
fail
due
to
abuse,
and
he
would
rule
those
out.
in
essence,
he
would
show
a
negative
to
determine
whether
or
not
this--
mr.
sidney
w.
jackson
--i
believe
that
is
sufficient,
your
honor.
mr.
sidney
w.
jackson
well,
his
basis
would
be,
based
on
his
experience,
that
if
you
do
not
see
those
signs
of
abuse,
then
the
only
conclusion
is
that
it
failed
due
to
a
defect,
and
at
least
that
should
be
sufficient,
with
the
other
evidence
we
have,
to
determine
whether
or
not
there
is
a
proper
question
for
the
jury.
mr.
sidney
w.
jackson
well,
we
propose,
justice
scalia,
that
would
go
to
the
weight
and
not
the
admissibility,
and
if
that
were
a
consideration,
i
believe
mr.
dodson,
the
expert
for
the
tire
industry,
would
have
said,
no,
these
signs
are
totally
off
the
wall.
that
doesn't
mean
anything.
the
methodology
is
incorrect.
mr.
sidney
w.
jackson
there
are
four
signs.
mr.
sidney
w.
jackson
well,
but
again,
the
calculus
that
has
to
be
invoked
here
is
alabama
substantive
law.
we
do
not
have
to
prove
a
specific
defect.
to
do
so,
we
would
have
to
go
back
to
korea
and
depose
the
people
that
made
the
tire
on
a
specific
day,
and
do
it
that
way.
under
alabama
law,
the
negligence
is
placing
a
defective
product
in
the
stream
of
commerce
that
reaches
the
end
user
in
a
dangerously
defective
condition.
it
lightens
up
the
burden
of
having
to
go
prove
a
specific
defect,
and
this
case,
along
with
a
lot
of
cases
cited
by
the
government
in
their
brief,
is
perfect
area
of
testimony
for
experienced-based
testimony.
mr.
sidney
w.
jackson
probably
a
bad
tire--
mr.
sidney
w.
jackson
--but
you
have
to
look.
mr.
sidney
w.
jackson
to
answer
your
question
on
the
abuse
of
discretion
from
a
factual
standpoint--
mr.
sidney
w.
jackson
--first,
mr.
carlson
did
rule
out
other
causes
such
as
cuts,
puncture
holes.
he
did
look
at
those,
and
so
that
one
goes
to
weight
and
not
the
admissibility.
the
age
of
the
tire
is
a
problem.
this
was
not
a
brand
new
tire,
but
it
was
not
an
illegal
tire.
it
had
enough
tread
to
make
it
legal
under
the
alabama
standards.
mr.
sidney
w.
jackson
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
sidney
w.
jackson
they
don't
know
the
exact
date,
but
the
tire
was
made
in
1988,
yes,
sir.
mr.
sidney
w.
jackson
i
believe
that
was
a
typographical
error
in
the
report.
mr.
sidney
w.
jackson
yes,
sir,
that's
correct.
mr.
sidney
w.
jackson
he
does
make
that
conclusion,
justice
kennedy,
and
that
is
in
his
affidavit.
as
far
as
proof
at
trial,
which
we
haven't
gotten
there
yet--
mr.
sidney
w.
jackson
--well,
i
believe
ruling
out
abuse--
mr.
sidney
w.
jackson
--i
don't
believe
this
expert
will
ever
make
it
through
the
daubert
gate,
because
he
is
experience...
he
has
experience-based--
mr.
sidney
w.
jackson
--testimony.
he
will
fit
in
the
fourth
criteria,
i
believe,
if
it
is
not
limited
to
the
scientific
community.
mr.
sidney
w.
jackson
mr.
chief
justice
rehnquist,
i
believe
what
the
eleventh
circuit
did
is,
they
made
a
distinction
without
a
difference.
they
distinguished
between
scientific
and
nonscientific.
you
know
the
old
saying,
there's
more
than
one
way
to
skin
a
cat.
that
was
an
easy
way
to
do
it,
because
this
expert's
testimony
was
so
far
removed
from
a
teratologist
that
the
criteria
in
daubert
just
had
no
place
at
all,
but
we
think
the
better
approach,
as
professors
berger,
imwinkelried,
and
salzburg
said,
is,
you
look
at
the
intellectual
rigor
used
in
the
field
in
question,
and
the
first
thing--
mr.
sidney
w.
jackson
--i
do
not
disagree
with
the
reasoning.
i
think
they
ruled
that
under
u.s.
v.
koon,
the
sentencing
guideline
case
where
the
judge
deviated
from
the
sentencing
guidelines,
that
this
was
an
absolute
error
of
law
to
incorrectly
interpret
daubert
and
incorrectly
apply
rule
702,
and
the
eleventh
circuit
has
again
recently
spoken
on
that
in
city
of
tuscaloosa
v.
harsco--
mr.
sidney
w.
jackson
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
sidney
w.
jackson
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
sidney
w.
jackson
well,
i
believe
in
the
eleventh
circuit,
using
the
beekeeper
analogy,
they
kind
of
drew
a
spectrum,
beekeepers
on
one
end,
teratologists
on
the
other,
and
said,
this
tire
failure
analysis,
who
gets
his
hands
dirty
showing
the
jury
what's
there
and
what's
not
there
is
more
like
a
beekeeper
who
has
a
lot
of
experience.
mr.
sidney
w.
jackson
justice
ginsburg,
there
is
no
test
known
of
by
any
expert
in
the
field
that
we
have
come
across
that
can
test
a
failed
tire.
it's
like--
mr.
sidney
w.
jackson
--no,
your
honor.
mr.
sidney
w.
jackson
there's
no--
mr.
sidney
w.
jackson
--no,
your
honor.
i
don't
believe
it
would
be
irrelevant.
mr.
sidney
w.
jackson
i
do
not
believe
that
would
be
irrelevant,
but
it
just
does
not
exist
in
this
field.
that
is
like
checking
a
cadaver
for
reflexes.
a
failed
tire
does
not
have
the
testability
that
a
tire
before
it
fails
does.
mr.
sidney
w.
jackson
i
understand,
your
honor.
mr.
sidney
w.
jackson
yes,
your
honor,
but
the
point
i'm
not
very
eloquently
making
is,
you
need
to
look
at
the
field
to
see
if
those
questions
are
relevant,
not
just
apply
the
questions
in
a
one-size-fits-all
wooden,
rigorous
approach
that
the
trial
court
did
here.
look
at
what--
mr.
sidney
w.
jackson
--well--
mr.
sidney
w.
jackson
--they
can
always
be
asked,
and
there's
flexibility
in
daubert,
we
agree,
but
in
the
field
of
tire
failure
analysis,
handwriting
analysis,
trace
evidence
analysis,
finger
printing
analysis,
you
never
really
know
if
you're
correct,
so
to
do
what
the
petitioners
want
is
to
have
a...
to
have
a...
there
must
be
some
validation
by
objective
criteria
is
not
in
rule
702.
mr.
sidney
w.
jackson
we
agree
with
that
proposition.
mr.
sidney
w.
jackson
yes,
sir.
mr.
sidney
w.
jackson
your
honor--
mr.
sidney
w.
jackson
--i
don't
believe
that
was
an
error
of
law,
your
honor.
the
result
is
correct,
and
they
determined
that
woodenly,
rigidly
applying
daubert
is
an
error
of
law.
they
used
a
distinction
between
scientific
and
nonscientific
like
the
sixth
circuit
did
in
city
of
detroit,
but
when
they--
mr.
sidney
w.
jackson
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
sidney
w.
jackson
well,
i
still
don't
believe
that
was
an
error
of
law.
they
remanded
saying
that
the
daubert
factors
may
be
applied
by
the
district
court,
but
that
the
district
court
should
not
put
himself
in
the
place
of
the
jury
or
in
the
adversarial
system.
mr.
sidney
w.
jackson
that's
correct,
mr.
chief
justice
rehnquist,
but
this
is
not
a
joiner
case.
in
joiner,
the
parties
argued
over
what
methodology
was
proper
in
trying
to
find
out
whether
pcb's
caused
lung
cancer,
and
there
were
tests
on
mice
where
they
would
inject
things
in
the
stomach,
and
then
they
would
develop
one
type
of
cancer,
and
the
parties
never
agreed
on
this
is
the
correct
methodology.
here,
the
record
evidence,
the
only
record
evidence
below
is
that
this
protocol,
this
methodology,
i
gather
the
information,
i
study
it,
i
look
for
abuse,
i
make
a
conclusion,
is
the
exact
methodology
used
by
mr.
carlson
and
mr.
dodson,
and
it
is
what
is
validated
by
the
marketplace
for
this
information.
mr.
sidney
w.
jackson
it...
no,
your
honor,
and
as
we
said,
the
court
of
appeals,
their
opinion
did
not
leave
much
guidance
on
what
the
court
should
do
below.
but
recently
they
have
cleared
that
up
in
city
of
tuscaloosa
v.
harsco,
where
ironically
they
reversed
a
judge
kicking
out
a
statistician
saying
he
did
not
fit
under
daubert
by
saying,
you
must
look
at
the
field
in
issue.
you
must
look
at
the
reliable
indicators
for
a
statistician,
and
the
court
said
that
man,
that
statistician
can
testify,
and
i
think
increasingly
in
the
lower
courts
they
are
not
woodenly
and
rigidly
applying
daubert
because
it's
a
useless
task
in
a
lot
of--
mr.
sidney
w.
jackson
--i
agree
with
that.
mr.
sidney
w.
jackson
i
agree.
mr.
sidney
w.
jackson
let
me
answer
you
this
way.
i
agree
with
the
solicitor
general
saying
that
a
flexible
approach
is
appropriate.
where
we
disagree
is
saying
that
this
trial
judge
or
any
district
court
judge
can
select
the
wrong
criteria,
and
that
be
only
an
abuse
of
discretion.
mr.
sidney
w.
jackson
that's
an
error
of
law
based
on
a
misinterpretation
of
rule
702,
which
702
does
not
say
you've
got
to
have
objective
validation.
it
does
not
say
you've
got
to
have
peer
review
and
publication.
mr.
sidney
w.
jackson
mr.
chief
justice
rehnquist,
i
believe
again
the
joiner
case
is
a
good
example
where
the
district
court
judge
had
to
make
a
judgment
call
on
what
criteria
is
appropriate
to
this
health
case
based
on
exposure,
and
that
should
be
reviewed
for
abuse
of
discretion.
i
believe
that
will
be
a
fairly
rare
case.
you
take
a
tire
failure
expert,
these
gentlemen
basically
do
the
same
thing,
and
if
the
court,
the
trial
court
makes
the
inquiry
initially
to
the
parties,
what's
this
expert
about,
what
is
this
testimony
about,
he's
probably
going
to
get
fairly
similar
criteria,
and
that
can
be
borne
out
in
the
record.
like
in
this
case,
there's
no
evidence
saying
this
protocol
is
not
proper.
in
fact,
i
don't
think
they
can.
mr.
sidney
w.
jackson
depends
on
which
way
the
judge
rules.
[laughter]
mr.
sidney
w.
jackson
my
response
to
that
question
would
be,
the
two
nail
holes,
it's
being
run
a
long
time,
it's
not
the
best
tire
on
earth,
that
goes
to
the
weight
and
not
the
admissibility
of
this
testimony,
and
this
testimony
is
certainly
reliable,
because
this
expert
did
consider
the
nail
holes,
he
did
consider
the
bald
spot,
and
he
had
an
answer
for
that.
it
may
not
be
an
answer
that
the
jury
believes,
but
it's
based
on
reliable
experience
with
the
leader
in
the
tire
industry,
namely,
michelin.
they
paid
for
that
type
of
work
for
10
years
while
he
was
at
michelin,
and
that
goes
to
the
soul
of
702,
knowledge.
and
it
didn't
say
knowledge
based
on
joining
a
science
club
or
something
like
that.
knowledge
can
be
based
on
knowledge,
under
rule
702.
it
can
be
based
on
experience,
or
skill,
or
training,
or
education,
and
those
factors
go
to
the
inquiry
of
the
relevancy.
and
then
does
his
testimony
fit?
well,
certainly
it
fits,
because
he
saw
this
same
thing
happen,
so
he
says,
at
michelin,
and
again,
if
that's
not
good
enough
for
the
jury,
that's
fine,
but
702
is
to
enable
the
jury
to
hear
all
of
this
testimony
and
then
the
judge
should
determine,
have
we
sustained
our
burden,
producing
enough
evidence
to
get
it
to
the
jury.
that's
all
we
ask
to
do.
mr.
sidney
w.
jackson
i'm
sorry,
your
honor.
mr.
sidney
w.
jackson
well,
your
honor,
this
is
not
junk
engineering.
it
is
based
on
valid,
reliable,
experience-based
testimony.
if
there
is
not
a
creditable
link--
mr.
sidney
w.
jackson
--i
understand.
mr.
sidney
w.
jackson
i
don't
have
a
problem
with
judges
stopping
some
experts
from
going
to
the
jury,
but
the
judge
should
not
have
to
be
an
amateur
scientist
or
an
amateur
engineer
on
tuesday
and
a
statistician
on
wednesday.
they're
just
not
equipped.
and
we...
we
believe
that
the
correct
approach,
as
set
out
in
the
amici,
is
to
let
the
judge
ask
the
parties,
what
is
this
field
here.
mr.
sidney
w.
jackson
that
is
a
wonderful
cross-examination,
but
this
expert
considered
those
factors,
and
i
think
any
expert
would,
and
an
expert
can
be
ruled
out
of
court
if
he
fails
to
rule
out
a
crucial
test.
on
the
same
page
where
the
judge
said
he
didn't
like
our
analytical
leap
from
the
evidence
to
the
conclusion,
he
cited
the
diviero
case.
in
diviero
a
tire
expert
was
kicked
out
of
court
because
he
did
not
do
exactly
what
mr.
carlson
did
here.
he
did
not
rule
out
abuse,
tire
cracking,
sidewall
deterioration,
and
they
said...
and
that
was
based
on
testimony
from
the
tire
industry
that
unless
you
rule
out
abuse,
you
cannot
prove
defect.
so
in
essence
what
mr.
carlson
did
here
is
something
that's
been
approved
by
the
industry.
there's
no
doubt
that
the
judge
should
make
there
be
a
threshold
status
of
reliability
before
an
expert
testifies,
but
the
burden
is
not
as
high
as
petitioners
want
it.
if
the
burden
is,
you've
got
to
fit
within
the
daubert
factors,
then
all
of
this
experience-based
testimony,
which
is
by
and
large
used
by
law
enforcement,
is
in
danger.
mr.
sidney
w.
jackson
well,
i
believe
that
method,
so
to
speak,
is
to
give
the
tire
the
benefit
of
the
doubt,
because
this
is
not
an
exact
science,
and
this
is
subjective,
and
there's
subjectivity
involved,
and
this
expert
knows
he's
going
to
get
cross-examined
about
the
weaknesses
in
his
testimony.
but
i
believe
the
trial
judge
saw
the
word,
methodology,
and
immediately
leaped
into
daubert,
and
when
he
could
not
see
an
objective
test,
or
objective
validation,
then
he
had
a
big
problem
with
this
testimony.
he
just
did
not
like
it.
but
when--
mr.
sidney
w.
jackson
--your
honor--
mr.
sidney
w.
jackson
--well,
from
the
get-go
he
applied
the
four
factors
and
we
flunked
him.
he
was
asked
to
apply
other
criteria,
which
is
referenced
in
footnote
8
of
daubert,
and
said
those
were
of
dubious
merit
because
the
supreme
court,
u.s.
supreme
court
did
not
approve
of
them
explicitly.
those
factors
give
litigants
and
courts
other
criteria
to
use
that
may
fit
the
particular
field
at
issue,
and
again
will
give
judges
basis
to
look
at
the
intellectual
rigor,
or
lack
of
intellectual
rigor,
whatever
you
have,
in
that
field,
just
like
the
magenta
example.
for
an
experience-based
expert
not
to
be
able
to
give
his
opinion
on
something
that
he
has
learned
in
his
experience,
or
in
his
lifetime,
just
tears
702
up,
which
is
supposed
to
be
a
rule
of
inclusion.
