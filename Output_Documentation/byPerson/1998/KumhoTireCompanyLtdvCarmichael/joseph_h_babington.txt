mr.
joseph
h.
babington
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
we
are
here
today
because
the
circuit
court
unduly
restricted
the
district
court's
evaluation
of
the
reliability
of
certain
expert
testimony
offered
by
respondents.
the
eleventh
circuit
barred
the
district
court
from
considering
the
reliability
factors
set
forth
in
this
court's
decision
in
daubert
v.
merrell
dow.
if
permitted
to
stand,
the
eleventh
circuit's
decision
would
allow
experts
to
escape
scrutiny
under
the
reliability
factors
merely
by
invoking
experience
in
some
broad
sense
as
a
basis
for
testimony.
mr.
joseph
h.
babington
justice
kennedy,
we
disagree
with
that
interpretation
of
the
record.
first,
the...
it
it
is
clear
that
the
petitioners'
expert
physically
examined
the
tire
before
he
issued
his
report.
the
respondents'
expert,
by
contrast,
issued
his
report
containing
his
conclusion
before
conducting
any
physical
examination
of
the
tire.
in
addition,
there
was
a
completely
different
methodology
that
was
used,
and
that's
what
troubled,
most
troubled
the
district
court.
the
methodology
used
by
the
respondents'
expert
was
a
process
of
elimination,
rule
of
thumb
methodology
that
we
pointed
out
in
our
briefs,
and
by
contrast,
our
expert
used
a
methodology
that
asked
very
broadly,
what
are
the
causes,
why
did
this
tire
come
out
of
service,
and
in
asking
that
looked
at
all
of
the
evidence
and
did
not
limit
his
consideration
of
the
evidence
just
to
eliminating
certain
factors
of
abuse.
mr.
joseph
h.
babington
they
looked
for
the
same
evidence
on
the
tire
in
some
respects.
the
respondents'
expert,
of
course,
limited
his
consideration,
did
not
look
for
particularly
affirmative
evidence
of
defect.
but
the
major
difference
was
the
way
that
they...
the
method
that
they
applied
to
get
from
what
they
saw
on
the
tire
to
their
ultimate
conclusion
in
the
case,
and
our
point
is
that
a
district
court,
in
evaluating
the
reliability
of
expert
testimony
offered
by
parties
before
a
court
should
not
be
prohibited
from
considering
the
logical,
common
sense
questions
that
flow
out
of
this
court's
daubert
factors,
broadly
understood.
the
lower
courts
have
applied
and
understood
the
daubert
factors
in
a
flexible,
broad
manner,
as
this
court
intended.
mr.
joseph
h.
babington
the
standard
of
review
of
the
eleventh
circuit's
holdings
that
were
the
basis
for
its
decision
should
be
reviewed
de
novo.
the
eleventh
circuit
made
two
errors
of
law.
first,
it
crafted
this
experience
exception
that
i
was
discussing,
which
is
that
if
an
expert
invokes
experience--
mr.
joseph
h.
babington
--well,
i
think
it
would
be
a
combination.
certainly
as
to
the
standard
that
should
be
applied,
that's
a
question
of
law.
our
point
is
that
the
eleventh
circuit
erred
in
how
it
interpreted
this
court's
daubert
decision.
in
footnote
8
in
daubert,
this
court
said,
our
discussion
is
limited
to
the
scientific
context,
because
that
was
what
was
before
the
court.
mr.
joseph
h.
babington
well,
the...
what
we
contend
the
court
did
in
daubert
was
to
set
forth
general,
broad,
common
sense
criteria
that
courts
can
use
to
determine
the
reliability
of
a
broad
range
of
expert
testimony.
mr.
joseph
h.
babington
yes.
if
you
look
at
the
district
court's
opinion
on
reconsideration,
i
think
it's
specifically
discussed
in
the
joint
appendix
at
pages
91
and
92.
the
district
court
considered
the
respondents'
argument
that
the
respondents'
expert
did
the
same
thing
as
the
petitioners'
expert,
and
that
there
was
evidence
in
the
record
that
supported
the
view
that
what
the
respondents'
expert
did
was
commonly
accepted.
everyone
did
it
this
way.
and
the
district
court
specifically
rejected
that,
saying
that
the
evidence
before
the
court
did
not
establish
that.
at
most,
all
it
established
was
that
the
two
experts
used
the
same
method
of...
or
technique
of
gathering
data,
and
that's
really
not
that
surprising.
you
should
look
first
to
the
product
in
question
to
gather
your
data.
what
most
troubled
the
district
court
was
the
methodology,
how
the
experts
got
from
the
information
on
which
they
were
basing
their
opinion
to
their
ultimate
conclusion,
and
as
this
court
pointed
out
in
joiner,
the
ipse
dixit
of
the
expert
is
insufficient
to
support
the
ultimate
conclusion.
there
must
be
some
objective
validation
or
criteria
that
the
district
court
can
look
to.
how
does
the
district
court
otherwise
know
that
the
expert's
not
just
making
it
up,
and
that's
really
the
point
of
our
argument,
that
the
district
court,
in
answering
that
central
question,
should
be
allowed
to
ask
the
logical,
common
sense
questions
that
flow
out
of
this
court's
daubert
criteria.
mr.
joseph
h.
babington
absolutely.
what
the
district
court
did
was
consider
the
fact,
the
logical
flaws
in
the
respondents'
expert's
approach.
for
example,
that
even
though
he
had
a
methodology,
he
didn't
even
apply
the
methodology
in
this
case.
instead
of
physically
examining
the
tire
first,
he
looked
at
photographs
of
the
tire,
and
he
admitted
that
he
didn't
know
whether
his
past
analyses
of
failed
tires
had
ever
been
correct.
mr.
joseph
h.
babington
well,
we
think
that
the
proposed
rule
merely
is
an
attempt
to
put
down
more
clearly
the
existing
law,
is
what
i
understand
that
the
advisory
committee
is
attempting
to
do.
it
is
a
mere
proposal.
it
hasn't
been
acted
on
yet.
but
that
standard
is
an
effort
by
the
advisory
committee
to
put
down
in
the
rules
what
the
lower
courts
have
thought
about
how
they
should
assess
reliability
of
expert
testimony
following
this
court's
landmark
daubert
decision,
and
under
the
new
rule,
or
under
the...
so
to
answer
your
question,
the
answer
really
wouldn't
be
any
different.
the
daubert
criteria,
broadly
understood
and
flexibly
applied,
lead
to
exactly
the
type
of
questions
that
the
district
court
asked
of
this
expert
to
determine
if
his
testimony
was
more
than
just
his
say-so,
more
than
just
guesswork
or
speculation.
mr.
joseph
h.
babington
that's
correct,
mr.
chief
justice.
we
are
saying
that
it's
clear
that
the
gatekeeper
function
applies
to
any
expert
offered
under
rule
702.
the
respondents
agree
with
that.
the
solicitor
general
agrees
with
that.
i
don't
think
any
of
the
amici
seriously
question
that.
that's
very
clear.
mr.
joseph
h.
babington
what
we're--
mr.
joseph
h.
babington
--that's
correct,
justice
scalia.
what
we
are
saying
is
that
the
gatekeeper
function
definitely
applies
to
all
experts,
and
then
in
how
the
judge
exercises
his
gatekeeper
function
to
determine
whether
there
is
a
reliable
foundation
for
the
expert
testimony
that's
been
proffered
involves
his
asking
of
questions
such
as
those
that
logically
flow
out
of
the
daubert
factors.
mr.
joseph
h.
babington
justice
breyer--
mr.
joseph
h.
babington
--justice
breyer,
we
agree
that
the
daubert
factors
can
be
flexibly
applied--
mr.
joseph
h.
babington
--we
agree
that
in
certain
cases
it
may
be
appropriate
not
to
apply--
mr.
joseph
h.
babington
--well,
the
district...
our
point
is
that
the
district
judge
should
be
allowed
to
ask
the
logical,
common
sense
questions.
mr.
joseph
h.
babington
we
think
that
the
broad--
mr.
joseph
h.
babington
--we
think
that
the
broad
standard
should
be
that...
reviewable
as
for...
under...
as
i
understood,
justice
o'connor's
question
was,
what
was
the
standard
of
review,
and
the
standard
is
a
matter
of
law.
now,
how
that
standard
is
applied
is
for
abuse
of
discretion.
mr.
joseph
h.
babington
no.
i
think
i
understand
the
question,
which
is
that
in
certain
cases,
would
a
district
court
be
wrong,
or
would
he
err
in
not
applying
the
daubert
factors.
is
that
the--
mr.
joseph
h.
babington
--i
think,
you
know,
we're
arguing
over
semantics.
where
i'm
having
trouble
with
your
question
is,
i
think
that
the
standard
is
a
legal
standard,
reviewable
de
novo,
but
how
that
standard
is
applied
in
a
particular
case
is
reviewable
by
abuse
of
discretion.
mr.
joseph
h.
babington
exactly.
our
point
is
that
the
district
court
should
be
allowed
to
ask
these
questions
as
appropriate--
mr.
joseph
h.
babington
--in
every
case.
mr.
joseph
h.
babington
right.
if--
mr.
joseph
h.
babington
--yes.
if
the
proponent
of
the
evidence,
justice
scalia,
comes
forward
and
says,
this
factor
should
not
be
given
much
weight
in
this
case,
then,
of
course,
the
court
can
say,
as
this
court
noted
in
daubert,
that
perhaps
peer
review
isn't
something
that
would
be
applicable
in
every
case,
and
it
should
be
given
little
or
no
weight,
and
the--
mr.
joseph
h.
babington
--that's
exactly
our
point.
it
should
be
based
on
the
evidence
that's
before
the
court.
it
may
be
that
in
a
particular
case
the
expert
can't
trace
from
the
facts
to
the
conclusion
by--
mr.
joseph
h.
babington
--the
questions
are
always
relevant,
absolutely.
that's
our
point.
mr.
joseph
h.
babington
our
point,
justice
ginsburg,
is
that
it's...
the
district
court
should
be
allowed
to
ask
those
questions
and
have
the
expert
explain
why
the
particular
question
flowing
out
of
one
of
the
daubert
criteria
doesn't
apply
to
that
particular
expert,
but
we
believe
the
beekeeper
can
be
adequately
reviewed
under
the
daubert
factors.
i
think
one
of
our
amici,
the
product
liability
advisory
council,
in
fact,
in
their
footnote
12
in
their
brief,
pointed
out
that
there
are
studies
dealing
with
beekeepers
that
actually
speak
to
the
issue
that's
mentioned
in
that
analogy.
i
would
like
to
reserve
the--
mr.
joseph
h.
babington
--that's
correct.
mr.
joseph
h.
babington
that's
correct.
we'd
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my--
mr.
joseph
h.
babington
--that's
correct,
if
there
was
some
objective,
other
objective
support
that
the
expert
could
put
forth
to
show
that
his
testimony
was
based
on
good
grounds
on
proper
validation.
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
balance.
mr.
joseph
h.
babington
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
respondents
have
offered
no
defense
of
the
eleventh
circuit's
holding.
this
court
should
reverse
the
eleventh
circuit,
because
its
decision
was
based
on
two
errors
of
law.
it's
wrong
to
take
away
from
the
district
court
the
logical,
common
sense
questions
that
flow
from
this
court's
daubert
factors.
these
questions
should
be
always
available
to
be
asked,
and
the
proponent
of
the
evidence
can
explain
why
in
a
particular
case
they
may
be
inapplicable
or
entitled
to
less
weight.
we
urge
the
court
to
go
further
and
affirm
the
district
court's
holding,
because
the
district
court
got
it
right
here.
it
did
not
abuse
its
discretion.
the
district
court
considered
the
respondent's
primary
argument
before
this
court
on
page
93
in
the
joint
appendix
in
its
opinion
on
reconsideration,
and
it
said
there
that
the
plaintiffs
contend
that
mr.
carlson's
testimony
reveals
that
the
methodology
and
principles
adopted
by
carlson
are
widely
accepted
in
the
relevant
community.
the
court
declines
to
make
such
a
leap.
so
the
district
court
has
already
considered
the
respondent's
primary
argument
and
rejected
it,
and
for
these
reasons
we
believe
it
should
be
affirmed.
if
there
are
no
further
questions--
