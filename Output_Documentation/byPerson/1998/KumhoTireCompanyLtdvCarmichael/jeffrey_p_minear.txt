mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
united
states
submits
that
the
court
of
appeals
erred
in
holding
that
expert
testimony
based
on
experience
is
categorically
exempt
from
the
reliability
analysis
that
this
court
described
in
daubert.
daubert
makes
clear
that
a
trial
judge
must
ensure
that
expert
testimony,
whatever
its
subject
matter,
rests
on
a
reliable
foundation
and
is
relevant
to
the
task
at
hand.
this
court
did
not
draw
distinctions
in
that
respect
between
expert
testimony
that
rests
on
scientific
principles
and
expert
testimony
that
rests
on
experience,
nor
did
it
lay
down
iron-clad
rules
governing
what
reliability
factors
a
trial
judge
may
properly
consider.
instead,
the
court
recognized
that
the
reliability
inquiry
is
a
flexible
one,
and
that
a
trial
judge
should
be
able
to
call
upon
the
full
range
of
relevant
considerations
in
determining
whether
the
expert
testimony
is
sufficiently
reliable
to
assist
the
trier
of
fact.
the
daubert
decision
did
identify
four
general
factors
that
a
court
may
find
useful
in
assessing
an
expert's
methodology.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
certainly.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
we
think--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--we
think
that
is
a
relevant
consideration
and,
in
fact,
broadly
speaking,
that
is
reflected
in
one
of
the
daubert
factors,
whether
there's
general
acceptance
of
the
opinion
that's
expressed,
but
we
also
believe
that
that's
only
one
factor,
and--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--certainly
not.
we
think
the
ultimate
responsibility
for
the
trial
judge
is
to
make
a
rational
determination
of
whether
the
evidence
is
sufficiently
reliable
to
assist
the
trier
of
fact.
if
there
is
no
indicia
of
reliability
whatsoever,
if
the
field
is
simply
raft
with
odd
theories
that
cannot
be
reconciled
and
have
never
been
tested,
and
we
think
that's
an
important
consideration
for
the
trial
judge
to
take
into
account,
and
would
most
likely
exclude
that
type
of
evidence.
now,
the
court
did
identify
those
four
factors--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--yes,
we
do,
your
honor.
we
believe
that
the
trial
court
here
did
not
abuse
its
discretion
in
determining
that
mr.
carlson's
methodology
was
not
sufficiently
reliable.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
that
is
correct,
although
there
is
an
issue
of
law
here,
based
on
what
the
court
of
appeals
said.
the
court
of
appeals
established
as
a
matter
of
law,
so
it
said
on
page
104
of
the
joint
appendix,
that
daubert
does
not
apply
to
this
type
of
expert.
in
a
sense,
it
created
a
categorical
exemption
for
this
type
of
evidence,
and--
--and
the
district
court,
i
assume,
on
your
theory
would
have
committed
an
error
of
law
if
it
had
said,
the
four
daubert
factors
are
the
only
things
we
ever
consider
and
if,
in
fact,
one
flunks
the
four
daubert
factors,
that
as
a
matter
of
law
precludes
the
testimony,
that
would
have
been
a
legal
error,
too--
--that
would
have
been
a
legal
error--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--yes.
i
agree
with
that,
justice--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--i
think
that's
right.
an
example,
perhaps,
to
explain
that
would
be
a
statistician
who
offers
a
theory
that...
bayes'
theory
on
statistics,
and
he
attempts
to
validate
that
theory
simply
by
a
logical
proof,
and
he
goes
step
by
step
and
proves
that
that
statistical
theory
is
accurate.
that's
sufficient
basis
for
it
to
be
admitted
without
testing,
without
peer
review,
without
the
other
requirements.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
would...
it
would
have
been...
would
it
have
been
error
to
admit...
i
think
under
these
circumstances
we
would
think
that
it
would
have
been
an
abuse
of
discretion.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
would
have.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
it
affirmatively
would
have
been
an
abuse
of
discretion.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
that's
correct.
if
mr.
carlson
was
simply
testifying
on
his
own
visual
examination
of
the
standards
of
abuse
on
the
tire,
we
don't
think
that
that
would
necessarily
be
an
abuse
of
discretion.
the
problem
with
mr.
carlson's
testimony
here
was
there
was
nothing
to
support
his
ultimate
conclusion
that
there
must
be
a
defect.
his...
there
was
no
way
in
which
the
trial
court...
this
is
what
concerned
the
trial
court.
there
was
no
way
it
could
validate
his
opinion
that
because
there
are
only
marginal
signs
of
abuse,
there
must
be
a
defect,
and
that's
where
his
focus
was.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
that's
correct.
in
other
words,
you're
drawing
is
an
analytical
leap,
to
use
the
language
that
was
set
forth
in
joiner,
that
simply
was
not
justified
on
a
rational
basis
alone,
and
that's
why
the
court
here
thought
it
necessary
to
make
a
further
inquiry.
now,
all
four
of
the
inquiries
it
made
were
highly
pertinent
to
that
question.
if
mr.
carlson's
testimony
was,
in
fact,
accurate,
if
his
methodology
was
accurate,
then
it
should
be
susceptible
to
testing.
what
was
really
concerning
the
trial
court
here
was
that
there
was
no
testing
that
was
done
here,
and
there
was
no
way
to
know
whether
any
of
mr.
carlson's
projections
or
predictions
with
respect
to
defects
had
ever
been
proved.
now--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--we
think
the...
excuse
me,
the
respondents'
expert?
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
yes,
i
think
so,
and
what
we
had
here,
what
we
could
have
had
here
would
simply
be
a
dispute
over
whether
or
not
the
tire
was
abused,
in
which
case
the
petitioners'
expert
and
respondents'
expert
did
use
similar
methodology
with
regard
to
examining
the
tire,
saying
what
they
found
and
what
they
concluded
from
that
with
regard
to
abuse.
the
problem
in
this
case
is
that
respondents
have
to
prove
that
there
is
a
defect.
they
had
no
affirmative
evidence
of
a
defect,
and
they
relied
on
this
process
of
elimination
theory
to
reach
that
conclusion,
and
that's
where
the
trial
court
said
there
was
simply
too
far
of
an
analytical
leap
simply
to
say
that,
well,
we've
looked
at
the
tire
and
there's
only
marginal
signs
of
abuse,
so
there
must
be
a
defect,
even
though
there
was
no
evidence
of
a
defect
and
the
expert
was
unable
to
prove
that
whenever
this
situation
occurs
there
in
fact
is
a
defect.
there
was
never
any
controlled
laboratory
test
to
establish
the
veracity
or
corroborate
that
conclusion.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
yes,
if--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--if
abuse
is
read
broadly
enough.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
no,
i
don't
think
that
necessarily
follows.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
the
tire
could
simply
wear
out.
in
this
case,
90
percent--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--of
the
tread
was
gone.
the
tire
was
bald.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
yes.
i
don't
believe
that
mr.
carlson
defined
abuse
that
broadly.
i
mean,
he
did
do
it
in
the
context
of
the
service
life
of
the
tire,
so
i
think
that
it
depends
if...
the
problem
with
the
process
of
elimination--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--well,
i
think
even
he
agreed
that
there
were
some
signs
of
abuse,
although
he
discounted
them
based
on
his
experience
and
the
like,
so
i
don't
think
that
he
testified
that
there
was
no
evidence
of
abuse.
i
think
actually
his
testimony
was
that
oh,
yes,
there
is
shoulder
wear
on
the
tire,
but
i
ascribe
that
to
causes
other
than
abuse.
but
the
real
problem
here
was
that
leap
that,
well,
simply
because
i
only
see
these
signs
of
abuse,
the
tire
must
be
defective.
the
problem
with
the
process
of
elimination
approach
is,
you
must
make
sure
that
you've
eliminated
all
of
the
possible
causes,
and
certainly
there
are
many
tabloids
that
reported
flying
saucers
based
on
a
flawed
process
of
elimination
technology.
many
magic
tricks
turn
on
a
flawed
process
of
elimination
basis
to
trick
the
viewer.
and
that's
why
i
think
the
trial
court
was
rightly
skeptical
of
the
application
of
a
process
of
elimination
theory
without
any
sort
of
supporting
corroboration
that
would
indicate
that
that
process
was,
in
fact,
valid,
and
that
again
was
what
i
think
really
concerned
the
trial
court.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
thank
you.
