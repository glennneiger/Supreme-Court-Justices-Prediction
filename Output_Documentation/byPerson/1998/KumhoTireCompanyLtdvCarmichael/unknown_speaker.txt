unknown
speaker
at
some
point
during
your
argument...
i
just
am
troubled
by
this,
and
wish
you
would
address
it.
it
sounded
to
me
as
if
your
expert,
the
defense
expert,
used
just
about
the
same
methodology
as
the
plaintiff's
expert.
he
talked
about
over-deflected
operation
because
of
severe
beading,
groove
compressions,
the
discoloration
on
the
side,
and
i
don't
know
if
it's
waiver,
or
estoppel,
or
stipulation,
but
it
seems
to
me
that
this
is
what
your
expert
was
talking
about,
too,
and
i'm
troubled
by
it.
just
during
the
course
of
your
argument,
if
you
could
mention
that.
unknown
speaker
the
principal
attack
in
the
briefs,
as
i
understood
it,
on
the
plaintiff's
expert
was
that
he
had
these
four
factors.
now,
i
recognize
that
he
said,
if
there
are
four
and
any
two
are
present,
then
i'll
make
one
conclusion,
and
you
may
argue
about
that,
but
so
far
as
the
factors
that
he
uses,
i.e.,
the
discoloration,
the
beading,
et
cetera,
they
were
the
same,
were
they
not,
as
your
own
expert?
unknown
speaker
well
now,
let
me
ask
you
something.
the
eleventh
circuit
apparently
reviewed
the
decision
of
the
trial
court
to
apply
the
daubert
standard
de
novo.
the
eleventh
circuit
looked
at
that
de
novo,
said
it
was
a
question
of
law
and
it
would
look
at
it
de
novo,
but
i
think
acknowledged
that
the
ultimate
decision
of
the
district
court
whether
to
exclude
the
evidence
should
be
reviewed
on
an
abuse
of
discretion
standard.
now,
i'm
a
little
confused.
what
is
the
standard
we
should
apply
to
this
question
that
you
present
us
with
here?
do
we
look
at
it
de
novo,
or
do
we
look
at
it
under
an
abuse
of
discretion
standard?
unknown
speaker
well,
let
me
back
up,
then.
what
standard
of
review
should
the
eleventh
circuit
have
applied,
abuse
of
discretion,
or
some
de
novo
review,
or
a
combination
of
the
two?
unknown
speaker
well,
certainly
daubert
itself
indicated
that
it
was
dealing
there
with
some
kind
of
scientific
evidence,
and
it
didn't
purport
to
establish
some
global
principles
of
the
four
factors
in
every
case,
did
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
there's
a
lot
of
discussion
about
whether
we
should
look
to
a
standard
that
directs
the
trial
judge's
attention
to
indicia
of
reliability
in
the
field
at
issue.
i
mean,
what
is
it
regarding
this
issue
in
the
field
that
is
recognized
as
legitimate
for
an
inquiry?
now,
is
there
anything
in
this
record
to
show
that
the
district
court
made
any
findings
on
the
indicia
of
reliability
that
prevail
in
the
tire
manufacturing
field?
unknown
speaker
well,
does
the
record
show
the
district
court
looked
at
anything
other
than
the
four
daubert
factors?
unknown
speaker
mr.
babington,
there's
circulating
now
a
proposed
revision
of
rule
702,
and
that
is
set
forth
in
the
appendix
to
the
respondents'
brief.
it
says
there
are
three
things
to
look
at,
1)
the
reliability
of
the
facts,
the
reliability
of
the
principles
and
method,
and
finally
the
reliability
of
the
application.
would
you
think
that
that's
an
adequate
statement?
you
tell
us
that
the
eleventh
circuit
is
no
good
because
they
removed
all
of
the
standards.
daubert,
on
the
other
hand,
has
these
four
factors,
and
the
district
court
did
organize
its
decision
under
those.
but
suppose
we
had,
instead...
suppose
the
district
court
or
the
eleventh
circuit
had
said,
daubert
is
too
rigid,
we
like
these
standards,
would
that
be
acceptable?
unknown
speaker
what
you
are
saying,
mr.
babington,
i
take
it,
is
that
the
daubert
opinion
dealt
with
kind
of
scientific
peer
review
type
of
evidence,
but
that
the
gatekeeper
function
extends
beyond
that
to
anything
covered
by
rule
702
when
it's
dealing
with
expert
evidence.
unknown
speaker
well,
you're
contending
more
than
that.
you're
contending,
as
well,
that
the
daubert
factors
can
be
applied
to
any
expert
testimony.
unknown
speaker
are
broadly
applicable
to
any
expert
testimony,
not
exclusive,
but
broadly
applicable.
unknown
speaker
not
all.
not
all
would
do
that.
i
mean,
wouldn't
it
depend
on
whether
the
shoe
fits?
i
mean,
why
couldn't
you
have
an
expert
in
painting,
a
great
expert,
and
he
looks
at
that
and
says,
this
is
deep
magenta.
i
don't
even
know
what
magenta
is.
[laughter]
and
you
say,
how
do
you
know?
how
do
you
know?
he
says,
i've
looked
at
50,000
paintings.
believe
me,
i
work
for
the
philadelphia
museum
of
art,
i've
looked
at
so
many,
i
know.
i
recognize
it.
you
wouldn't
apply
daubert
factors
in
such
a
case.
i
mean,
isn't
it
daubert
factors
where
they
belong,
when
you're
trying
a
general
theory,
and
some
other
thing
where
it's
not?
unknown
speaker
is
that
right,
or
not?
unknown
speaker
no,
flexibly...
what
in
my
deep
magenta
case...
you
know,
the
daubert
factors
are
whether
the
technique
or
theory
used
could
be
tested
or
refuted,
whether
it's
been
a
subject
of
peer
review,
the
rate
of
error.
i
mean,
think
of
my
artist,
my
artist
expert.
he
says,
i've
seen
50
million
paintings.
believe
me,
i
know
deep
magenta
when
i
see
it.
the
daubert
factors
have
no
bearing
there,
do
they?
unknown
speaker
all
right.
then
if
that's
so,
why
did
you
answer
justice
o'connor
the
way
you
did?
why
wouldn't
it
be
whether
the
shoe
fits,
i.e.,
whether
the
daubert
factor
applies
here
or
not,
is
a
matter
for
the
district
judge,
subject
to
review
for
abuse
of
discretion?
unknown
speaker
i'm
asking
my
question.
my
question
is,
why
did
you
reply
to
justice
o'connor
by
saying...
why
didn't
you
say...
i
want
you
to
have
a
chance...
whether
you
apply
the
daubert
factors
or
whether
you
apply
my
deep
magenta,
which
is
experience,
depends
on
the
circumstance.
the
circumstance
is
up
to
the
district
judge,
reviewable
for
abuse
of
discretion
in
the
court
of
appeals.
now,
you
either
agree
with
that,
or
you
don't.
i
want
to
know
if
you
agree
with
it
and,
if
you
don't,
why
not?
unknown
speaker
do
you
agree
with
what
i
said
or
not?
unknown
speaker
i'm
sorry,
i
still
want
to
know
if
you
agree
with
the
way
i
put
it.
you
don't
have
to
agree
by
any
means,
but
i'd
really
like
to
know.
i...
do
you
want
me
to
repeat
it
again,
or
not?
unknown
speaker
no.
my
question
is
whether
the
shoe
fits,
whether
you
apply
daubert
factors
to
an
expert
or
something
else,
like
deep
magenta,
experience,
whether
you
do
one
or
the
other
depends
on
whether
the
shoe
fits
in
the
particular
case.
it's
up
to
the
district
judge,
reviewable
for
abuse
of
discretion.
whether
our
case
is
a
case
involving
a
general,
testable
theory,
or
our
case
is
a
case
involving
reliance
upon
the
expert's
personal
experience,
whether
it's
the
one
or
the
other
is
up
to...
you
see
what
i'm
saying?
am
i
clear?
unknown
speaker
i
thought
your...
are
you
going
back
on
your
brief?
i
thought
your
brief's
position
was,
it's
always
okay
to
use
the
daubert
standards,
and
even
in
the
deep
magenta
case,
is
it
relevant
that
his
estimation
of
what
is
deep
magenta
is
not
susceptible
to
testing
or
falsification?
suppose
you
have
another
witness
who
says,
yes,
i've
also
examined
100,
and
i
have
had
my
judgment
tested
by
one
methodology
or
another.
isn't
it
relevant
whether
it's
subject
to
testing
or
falsification?
unknown
speaker
it's
never
wrong--
unknown
speaker
--it's
never
wrong
to
ask
those
questions.
unknown
speaker
isn't
that
your
position?
unknown
speaker
isn't
it
applicable
in
every
case?
if
you
have
two
witnesses,
and
one
of
them
comes
up
with
a
magenta
kind
of
stuff,
and
the
other
one
comes
up
with
something
that
seems
equivalently
fuzzy
but
he
says,
and
by
the
way,
my
judgment
as
to
these
1,000
paintings
was
subjected
to
peer
review,
and
the
entire
artistic
community
agreed
with
me,
wouldn't
that
make
his
testimony
more
reliable?
unknown
speaker
questions
are
always
relevant.
aren't
the
questions
always
relevant?
unknown
speaker
how
about
the
beehive
keeper
that
the
eleventh
circuit
fastened
on
as
an
example
of
somebody
who
has
great
expertise
based
on
constant
observation,
but
the
daubert
factors
don't
seem
to
fit
that
kind
of
expert.
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
you
one
last--
--just
one--
--justice
stevens.
i
just
wanted...
you
didn't
really
have
much
chance
to
respond
to
justice
kennedy's
beginning
question.
you
did
point
out
that
the
man
who
testified
had
not
looked
at
the
tire.
it
is
your
view,
though,
is
it
not,
that
even
if
edwards
had
been
the
witness,
his
testimony
would
also
have
been
inadmissible.
unknown
speaker
so
it
isn't
a
matter
of
not
having
looked
at
the
tire.
unknown
speaker
i
have
one
last
question
i'd
like
to
ask
you.
do
i
understand
you
correctly
that
your
position
is
that
the
daubert
factors
are
always
relevant,
that
the
four
daubert
questions
may
always
properly
be
asked,
but
there
are
some
cases
in
which
an
expert
might
flunk
on
all
four
daubert
factors
and
nonetheless
properly
be
admitted
to
testify.
is
that--
unknown
speaker
--thank
you,
mr.
babington.
mr.
minear,
we'll
hear
from
you.
unknown
speaker
mr.
minear,
do
you
agree
that
as
a
general
matter
the
trial
court
judge
should
exercise
the
gatekeeping
function--
unknown
speaker
--of
702
by
looking
to
the
indicia
of
reliability
prevailing
in
the
relevant
discipline?
unknown
speaker
is
that
what
they
do?
unknown
speaker
what
if
there's
no
standard
of...
i
mean,
what
if
there's
no
standard
of
reliability
in
the
relevant
discipline?
i
mean,
what
if
there
is
a
whole
cadre
of
tire
examiners
out
there,
all
of
which
use,
you
know,
witchcraft
science?
[laughter]
do
you
have
to
say,
well,
since
there
are
no
standards
of
reliability
in
this
field,
we
have
to
let
any
expert
testify?
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
that
in
this
case
the
district
court's
decision
not
to
admit
the
testimony
should
have
been
affirmed?
unknown
speaker
and
you
think
that
the
court
of
appeals
should
review
it
on
an
abuse
of
discretion
standard,
that
we
don't
have
some
issue
of
law
here?
unknown
speaker
--taken
to
the
other
extreme.
unknown
speaker
indeed,
that
would
have
been
a
legal
error
even
with
regard
to
the
most
scientific
of
scientific
testimony,
wouldn't
it?
unknown
speaker
in
this
case,
would
it
have
been
error
to
admit
the
expert's
testimony?
unknown
speaker
would
not?
unknown
speaker
would
have.
unknown
speaker
and
is
that
because
there
was
nothing
to
link
the
experience
with
the
conclusion
that
he
was
ready
to
offer?
unknown
speaker
it
would
be
as
if
in
justice
breyer's
hypothetical
he
said,
this
is
magenta,
and
therefore
it
must
have
been
based...
it
must
have
been
painted
over
a
canvas
that
had
been
sprayed
with
dye.
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask,
if
there
had
been...
the
plaintiffs
had
gotten
some
expert
testimony,
would
the
respondent's
expert
witness
testimony
have
been
admissible?
unknown
speaker
i
mean...
i'm
sorry,
i
got
it
backwards,
the
petitioners'
expert.
the
defendants'
expert.
would
that
testimony
have
been
admissible
had
it
been
necessary
to
reach,
you
know,
a
conflict
in
the
evidence?
unknown
speaker
well,
you
would
agree...
i
mean,
depending
on
how
broadly
you
mean
the
word
abuse...
would
a
road
hazard
be
an
abuse?
i
mean,
you
know,
you
non-negligently
run
over
a
nail
in
the
road.
you
consider
that
abuse?
unknown
speaker
okay.
unknown
speaker
is
read
broadly.
now,
is
it
a
rational
proposition
that
if
a
tire
has
not
been
subject
to
abuse
and
fails,
it
must
have
been
because
of
a
manufacturing
defect?
unknown
speaker
well,
what
else
could
it
be
due
to?
unknown
speaker
oh,
okay.
unknown
speaker
well,
you're
not
defining
abuse
broadly
enough,
then.
unknown
speaker
he
didn't
say
there
was
no
abuse.
he
said
there
was
no
evidence
of
abuse.
that
was
the
real
logical
flaw
in
his
analysis,
wasn't
it?
since
i
cannot
find
evidence
of
abuse,
it
must
have
been
a
manufacturing
defect.
i
might
have
gone
along
with
him
if
he
had
said,
since
there...
since
i
can
testify
for
sure
there
was
no
abuse,
reading
abuse
broadly,
including
running
the
tire
too
long,
running
over
a
nail
and
everything
else.
unknown
speaker
thank
you,
mr.
minear.
mr.
jackson,
we'll
hear
from
you.
unknown
speaker
excuse
me.
you
say
this
is
36
you
were
just
reading
from?
i
can't
find
where
you're--
unknown
speaker
--of
the
joint
appendix,
you
said?
unknown
speaker
36,
footnote
7.
unknown
speaker
well,
how
much
of
this,
mr.
jackson,
is
controlled
by
alabama
law
and
how
much
by
the
federal
law
of
evidence?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
so
then,
what
is
the
relevance
of
alabama
law
to
this
particular
case
and
this
question
we
have
before
us
now?
unknown
speaker
well,
if
you
say...
but
that...
what
mr.
carlson
was
trying
to
do
was
to
qualify
himself
as
an
expert,
was
he
not?
unknown
speaker
why
would
alabama
law
control
whether
or
not
the
district
court
should
admit
his
testimony
under
rule
702?
unknown
speaker
then
why
are
you
saying
what
you
are?
unknown
speaker
i
did
not
understand
that
he
was
going
to
say
that
there
could
be
no
abuse
unless
he
found
signs
of
abuse.
was
he
willing
to
say
that,
that
he
could
guarantee
the
jury
that
if
there
was
any
abuse,
i
would
have
seen
signs
of
abuse?
unknown
speaker
well,
if
he
can't
do
that,
then
he
can't
eliminate
abuse,
and
if
you
can't
eliminate
abuse,
you
cannot
make
the
assumption
that
there
must
have
been
a
manufacturing
defect.
unknown
speaker
he
can
just
say,
i
didn't
see
any
signs
of
abuse.
unknown
speaker
but
there
may
have
been
abuse
that
i...
that
didn't
produce
any
signs,
and
as
long
as
there's
that
gap,
it
seems
to
me
you
never
get
to
the
conclusion.
unknown
speaker
i
understand
what
you're
saying,
if
he
was
being
introduced
to
the
jury
simply
to
prove
the
point
that
there
were
no
objective
indicia
of
abuse,
but
that
isn't
what
he
testified.
he
testified
to
the
jury,
there
was
a
manufacturing
defect
in
this
tire,
and
he
could
not
testify
to
that
unless
he
could
testify
that
if
there
had
been
abuse,
i
would
have
seen
some
objective
indicia
of
it,
and
you
say
he
didn't
testify
that
and
couldn't
testify
that.
unknown
speaker
he
couldn't
rule
out
abuse.
i
thought
you
answered
my
question--
unknown
speaker
--that
he
never
testified
that
if
there
was
abuse,
i
would
certainly
have
seen
indicia
of
it.
did
he
say
that?
unknown
speaker
i
think
all
he
could
have
testified
to
was,
i
saw
no
signs
of
abuse.
now,
maybe
that
expert
testimony
could
go
to
the
jury.
unknown
speaker
but
he
wanted
to
testify
to
more
than
that.
he
wanted
to
testify
to
the
jury,
ladies
and
gentlemen
of
the
jury,
this
tire
was
defectively
manufactured,
and
he
had
no
basis,
scientifically
or
otherwise,
for
that
conclusion.
unknown
speaker
unless
there
was
abuse
that
left
no
signs.
unknown
speaker
i
don't
think
it
goes
to
the
weight
at
all.
i
think
it
goes
to
the
conclusion.
i
think
it
is
logically
impossible
to
testify
that
there
was
a
manufacturing
defect
unless
you
can
say,
if
there
had
been
abuse,
i
would
have
seen
signs
of
it,
and
you
tell
me
he
couldn't
testify
to
that.
he
could
testify
that
normally,
usually
when
there
is
abuse,
some
sign
is
there.
unknown
speaker
but
he
couldn't
say...
he
couldn't
say
that
there
was
always
a
sign.
unknown
speaker
but
how...
yes.
you've
put
your
finger
on
just
the
question
that's
bothering
me.
in
this
case,
i
take
it
he
said,
if
you
don't
find
the
abuse
factors,
then,
he
says,
it's
probably
a
bad
tire.
unknown
speaker
yes.
now--
unknown
speaker
--yes,
but
the
look
is
out
of
this.
that
wasn't
what
was...
that's
a
different
issue.
i
don't
think
look,
except
in...
he
says,
these
are
the
factors.
tread
wear,
sidewall
deterioration,
something
called
beading,
and
something
on
a
flange.
and
the
judge
is
thinking
to
himself,
now,
wait
a
minute,
here.
i
have
a
tire
that's
gone
perhaps
100,000
miles,
it's
bald
in
places,
it's
had
a
nail
driven
into
it,
the
nail
hole
seems
not...
what
do
you
mean,
if
those
four
factors
aren't
there
there's
only
abuse.
i
mean,
it
has
to
be
a
defect.
there
are
all
kinds
of
other
things
here.
so
he
says
to
the
expert,
expert,
you
mean
to
say
even
in
a
tire
like
this
one,
in
the
absence
of
those
four
factors
there
had
to
be
a
defect?
what
about
the
nail?
what
about
the
bald
spot?
what
about
all
that
stuff?
and
the
expert
says,
no,
in
my
experience
if
those
four
factors
aren't
there,
there's
a
manufacturing
defect,
and
at
that
point
the
judge
is
thinking,
my
goodness,
what
kind
of
a
theory
is
that?
is
there
any
other
expert
who
believes
that?
and
that
is
what
it
seems
to
me
is
in
front
of
us.
has
the
judge
abused
his
discretion
in
that
circumstance
to
say,
if
there's
some
theory
that
without
those
beading
problems,
it's
a
manufacturing
defect,
and
nails
don't
count,
and
100,000
miles
doesn't
count,
if
there's
scientific
theory
like
that,
you'd
better
tell
us
what
it
is,
because
you
couldn't
have
had
that
much
experience.
now,
that's...
i'd
like
to
hear
your
response.
unknown
speaker
uh-huh,
yes.
unknown
speaker
your
witness
thought
it
was
10
years
older
than
it
was,
as
i
recall.
unknown
speaker
that's
what
he
said,
initially.
unknown
speaker
yes,
and
he
said
'78
in
his
initial--
unknown
speaker
--which
he
repeated
in
the
later
deposition
as
well.
unknown
speaker
i
thought
where
you
were
going
when
you
began
your
argument
was
to
say,
the
only
thing
relevant
so
far
as
this
expert's
testimony
is
concerned,
was
whether
there
had
been
signs
of
abuse.
after
that,
alabama
law
would
take
care
of
it.
but
that
was
not
my
understanding
of
his
affidavit.
i
thought
he
went
on
to
say
that
because
of
my
examination
with
reference
to
abuse,
i
find
that
it
was
due
to
a
defect.
now,
that's
a
big
difference.
unknown
speaker
well
then,
it
isn't
just
abuse
that
we're
talking
about.
unknown
speaker
it's
this
very,
very
critical
leap,
or
inference
from
the
finding
of
no
abuse,
okay,
expert
testimony
on
that
is...
it's
subject
to
expert
testimony,
daubert
evaluation.
maybe
he
makes...
maybe
he
makes
it
through
the
daubert
gate,
but
then
he
goes
on
to
say,
and
because
there
was
no
abuse,
it
was
a
defect.
unknown
speaker
well--
unknown
speaker
--mr.
jackson,
looking
for
perhaps
the
larger
implications
of
this
case,
do
you
defend
the
eleventh
circuit's
splitting
off
expert
testimony
into
scientific
testimony
and
nonscientific
testimony
to
be
treated
quite
differently
in
light
of
the
gatekeeper
function?
unknown
speaker
so
you
don't
really
defend
the
ninth...
the
eleventh
circuit's
reasoning
here.
unknown
speaker
but
mr.
jackson,
the
division
of
the
world
into
scientific
versus
nonscientific...
we
have
two
neat
boxes,
daubert
for
scientific,
and
everything
else
nonscience.
i
think
it
was
convincingly
argued
that
the
world
is
not
that
simple,
that
there
are
shades.
unknown
speaker
then
there's
a
scale
from
highly
scientific,
and
then
going
down
to
pure
observation.
unknown
speaker
so
it
seems
to
me
that
the
eleventh
circuit
was
looking
for
an
easy
categorization
that
just
doesn't
conform
to
reality.
unknown
speaker
but
he
had
a
test.
he
said,
here's
my
method,
i've
got
these
four
factors.
going
back
to
justice
breyer's
question,
isn't
it
at
least
appropriate
to
ask,
do
the
other
experts
agree
with
this
four-factor
test,
and
if
you
don't
find
two,
whatever
his
method
was.
and
on
that
point,
is
there
anything
that
attests
to
the
reliability
of
his
method,
that
four-factor
method?
unknown
speaker
and
if
there
were,
you
think
it
would
have
been
irrelevant.
unknown
speaker
well
then,
you
think
the
daubert
factors
are
relevant.
let's
take
factor
number
3,
the
known
or
potential
error
rate.
unknown
speaker
suppose
your
witness,
your
expert
witness
had
been
able
to
come
to
the
court
and
tell
the
judge,
my
observations
have
been...
have
been
tested
by
later
experts
and
i
have
been
found
to
be
accurate
95
percent
of
the
time.
you
think
that
would
have
been
irrelevant.
or,
suppose--
unknown
speaker
--suppose
he
came
in
and
said,
my
methodology
has
been
reported
in
tire
testing
journal
and
has
been
approved
by...
you
know.
that
would
have
been
irrelevant?
unknown
speaker
merely
because
your
answer
to
a
question
is
no
does
not
mean
that
the
question
is
irrelevant.
unknown
speaker
the
answer
might
have
been
yes,
so
the
question
is
relevant,
and
that's
all
we're
talking
about,
whether
the
daubert
factors
are
relevant.
unknown
speaker
well,
you
have
to
look
to
the
field
to
see
whether
you
should
have
expected
a
yes
answer,
perhaps.
unknown
speaker
it
seems
to
me
the
questions
can
always
be
asked.
unknown
speaker
no,
i
don't
think
that's
what
he's
arguing
at
all.
he
said
in
response
to
my
question
that
all
four
daubert
factors
may
properly
be
applied.
they
are
always
relevant,
but
one
might
flunk
every
single
one
of
them
and
yet
nonetheless
produce
admissible
testimony
because
there
would
be
other
good
reasons
to
let
it
in,
and
there
would
be
good
reasons
to
discount
the
failure
to
meet
the
daubert
factors.
that's
all
he's
saying.
unknown
speaker
you
accept
that
proposition?
unknown
speaker
then
don't
you
necessarily
have
to
accept
the
position
that
the
eleventh
circuit
was
wrong
in
making
this
categorical
exclusion
of
relevance
based
on
drawing
a
line
between
what
is
in
some
pure
sense
scientific
and
what
is
not?
wasn't
that
at
least
an
error
of
law
on
the
circuit's
part--
unknown
speaker
--to
draw
that
categorical
distinction?
unknown
speaker
didn't
they
do
so
in
order
to
exclude
the
four
considerations
as
distinct
from
saying
the
four
considerations
are
always
relevant
but
may
be
of
little
or
no
weight?
isn't
that
the...
the
failure
to
draw
that
distinction
i
think
may
be
attributed
to
the
circuit.
unknown
speaker
and
wasn't
that
failure
an
error
of
law?
unknown
speaker
well,
of
course,
our
joiner
opinion
says
the
court
of
appeals
shouldn't
place
itself
in
the
place
of
the
district
court,
either,
that
they're
supposed
to
review
a
question
of
admissibility
like
this
on
an
abuse
of
discretion
standard,
which
the
court
of
appeals
certainly
didn't
do
here.
unknown
speaker
that
wasn't
the
reason
in
the
court
of
appeals.
unknown
speaker
so
is
that...
maybe
we...
there's
a
kind
of
general
agreement
here,
i
don't
know,
but
at
least
with
the
solicitor
general,
and
is
it
the
case
that
you
agree...
in
your
experience
as
a
trial
lawyer...
you're
experienced
with
the...
the
object
is
to
let
the
district
court
do
its
job,
and
its
job
is
a
gatekeeping
job
with
all
these
experts.
are
you
with...
you
agree
with
that?
unknown
speaker
all
right,
and
then
you'd
also
agree
that
there
isn't
a
rigid
categorization
as
between
science
or
not
where
you
could
say
the
daubert
test
is
or
is
not
useful.
the
answer
is
both
within
and
outside
something
that
the
harvard
university
would
call
science
or
something.
i
mean,
sometimes
within
that,
sometimes
outside
of
it
the
daubert's
helpful,
sometimes
it's
not
helpful.
unknown
speaker
all
right.
so
that
should
be
up
to
the
district...
to
the
trial
judge
to
say
which
is
which.
reviewable
for
abuse
of
discretion
in
the
court
of
appeals?
unknown
speaker
i
don't
know--
unknown
speaker
--but
that
converts
the
abuse
of
discretion
standard
into
almost
a
de
novo
standard
if
you
pick
out
something
that
the
district
court
did
and
say,
well,
this
was
an
error
of
law
and
therefore
we're
not
going
to
use
abuse
of
discretion.
certainly
just
because
the
court
of
appeals
disagrees
with
the
district
court
as
to
its
use
of
a
particular
factor,
that's
not
an
error
of
law.
unknown
speaker
but
they're
not
saying
that
this...
i
would
guess,
let's
see
what
you
respond,
that
the
hardest...
maybe
you
could
win
even
under
an
abuse
of
discretion
standard.
i
don't
know.
unknown
speaker
well,
the
hardest...
but
imagine
you're
in
the
eleventh
circuit
applying
abuse
of
discretion
standard.
i
guess
the...
in
my
mind,
anyway,
i
think
the
hardest
question
for
you
would
be,
you'd
say,
well,
look,
there
is
a
theory
going
on
here
that
in
the
absence
of
these
four
specific
factors,
not
any
kind
of
abuse
but
four
kinds,
beading,
flange,
whitewall
discoloration,
and
some
other
thing,
that
your
expert
seems
to
say,
in
the
absence
of
those
four
things,
it
must
have
been
defect.
and
immediately
a
common
sense
person
thinks,
what?
you
mean
nails
couldn't
be
an
abuse?
you
mean,
it's
bald
couldn't
be
an
abuse?
and
the
expert
says...
if
the
expert
then
says,
well,
i
have
a
lot
of
experience
at
this,
you
say,
wait
a
minute.
you
couldn't
have
seen
hundreds
or
thousands
of
tires
that
have
had
two
nails...
you
know,
two
nails
driven
into
them,
and
they're
bald,
and
they've
gone
100,000,
and
you've
found
the
absence
of
this
stuff,
and
yet
you
still...
that's
impossible.
you're
going
on
some
theory,
and
if
you're
going
on
some
theory,
you
tell
me
who
else
believes
that
theory.
do
you
see
what
i'm
saying?
i'm
saying
you'd
have
to
deal
with
that
question,
and
your
response
to
that
question
would
be?
unknown
speaker
why
don't
we
say
the
same
for
other
experts,
then?
i
mean--
unknown
speaker
--just
dump
it
all
before
the
jury.
ladies
and
gentlemen,
this
is
an
expert.
he
has
this
cockamamie
theory--
[laughter]
--that
contradicts
common
sense.
that
goes
to
the
weight
of
whether
you
should
believe
him.
but
all
of
this
junk
science
can
come
into
court.
it
just
goes
to
the
weight.
unknown
speaker
i'm
not
talking
about
this
case.
unknown
speaker
i'm
talking
about
your
theory
that
it
just
goes
to
the
weight.
i
mean,
that's
just
not
an
adequate
explanation,
if
you
believe
that
it's
the
role
of
the
judge
to
stop
some
cases
from
going
to
the
jury
because
there's
simply
not
enough
real
evidence
to
justify
a
verdict
for
the
plaintiff.
unknown
speaker
but
that
doesn't
square
with
your
answer
to
justice
breyer.
you
don't
have
to
be
an
amateur
rocket
scientist
to
know
that
when
two
nails
have
been
driven
into
a
tire
and
it's
bald,
the
absence
of
four
other
abuse
factors
does
not
suggest
that
there's
a
manufacturing
defect,
and
your
only
response
to
that
is,
that
goes
to
its
weight
and
it
should
come
before
the
jury.
unknown
speaker
but
it
wasn't
just
experience-based.
he
gave
a
method,
and
that's...
it
seems
to
me
makes
him
closer
to
the
aeronautical
engineer
than
the
beehive
keeper,
because
he
said,
now,
here's
my
theory.
here
are
these
four
things,
and
if
i
find
two,
then
it's
one
way,
and
if
i
don't,
then
it's
another
way.
that's
not
just,
now,
i
look
at
this
and
based
on
my
experience
reach
this
conclusion.
unknown
speaker
he
didn't
stop
there.
he
went
on
to
see
if
there
were
any
other
justifications,
explanations
and
so
forth.
unknown
speaker
he
went
on
to
say,
you
know,
it
is...
it
seems
to
me
illogical,
he
said.
it
isn't
just
that
there
are
no
scientific
journals
that
support
it.
it's
not
just
that
there's
no
testing
or
verification.
it
seemed
to
him
illogical.
i
mean,
that's
a
bit
different
from
just
saying,
you
know,
you
fail
the
four
daubert
tests
and
you're
out
of
here.
unknown
speaker
thank
you,
mr.
jackson.
mr.
babington,
you
have
2
minutes
remaining.
