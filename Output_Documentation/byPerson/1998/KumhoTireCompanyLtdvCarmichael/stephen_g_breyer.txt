justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
first
case
is
kumho
tire
co.
v.
patrick
carmichael.
it
follows
from
the
case
we
decided
six
years
ago
called
daubert
v.
merrell
dow,
and
in
that
case
the
court
held
that
district
courts
should
not
admit
expert
scientific
testimony
unless
the
district
judge
thought
it
was
reliable.
the
court
there
also
said
when
the
judge
carries
out
that
gatekeeping
function,
it
may
ask
certain
specific
questions
concerning
theories,
testability,
peer
review,
error
rate,
and
acceptance
within
a
relevant
scientific
community.
those
questions
could
help
determine
whether
scientific
testimony
is
reliable.
in
this
case
we
again
consider
the
admissibility
of
expert
testimony,
only
this
time
the
case
involves
not
scientific
testimony,
but
expert
engineering
testimonies.
the
case
arises
out
of
an
automobile
accident
that
took
place
in
1993.
the
plaintiffs
were
driving
in
a
minivan,
the
van’s
right
rear
tire
blew
out
and
the
plaintiffs
thought
it
was
a
defective
tire
and
they
brought
a
tort
suit
against
the
manufacturer
and
its
distributor.
to
help
prove
the
case
the
plaintiffs
wanted
to
introduce
the
testimony
of
a
tire
failure
expert,
and
he
was
going
to
testify
that
the
tire
was
defective.
he
reached
that
conclusion
based
upon
his
own
visual
and
tactile
examination
of
the
tire,
and
also
upon
a
theory
that
if
the
tire
was
not
defective
he
could
tell
by
the
presence
of
certain
rather
specific
physical
marks.
the
district
court
excluded
that
testimony.
the
judge
asked
the
questions
that
i
mentioned
before,
the
specific
questions
from
daubert
and
he
said
he
thought
the
answers
to
those
questions
showed
the
expert’s
testimony
was
not
reliable.
but
the
court
of
appeals
reversed,
because
the
question
was
asked
not
of
a
scientific
expert
but
of
a
different
kind
of
expert,
and
in
the
court
of
appeals’
view
the
daubert
questions
and
daubert
didn’t
apply.
we
disagree
with
the
court
of
appeals.
we
hold
first,
that
the
basic
gatekeeping
obligation
that
daubert
discussed
which
is
tied
back
to
the
federal
rules
of
evidence,
rule
702,
obligation
to
assure
that
testimony
is
not
only
relevant
but
reliable.
we
hold
that
that
obligation,
that
gatekeeping
function,
applies
not
just
to
scientific
testimony
but
to
all
expert
testimony.
second,
in
carrying
out
that
rule
we
say
that
the
court
may
consider
the
four
more
specific
questions
that
daubert
mentions
about
testability,
acceptance,
etcetera.
the
eleventh
circuit
had
held
that
a
trial
judge
may
ask
questions
of
this
sort
only
where
an
expert
relies
on
the
application
of
scientific
principles,
but
not
where
the
expert
relies
on
skill
or
experience
based
observation.
but
we
disagree
with
that.
we
think
sometimes
these
questions
or
factors
could
be
relevant
to
that
kind
of
testimony,
and
in
our
view
the
rule
of
evidence
doesn’t
match
certain
kinds
of
questions
to
certain
kinds
of
experts.
life
and
the
legal
cases
that
it
generates
is
simply
too
complex
to
warrant
a
definitive
match.
at
the
same
time
we
emphasize
in
respect
to
those
specific
questions
the
word
‘may’,
that
is
to
say
the
judge
‘may’
use
those
questions.
their
use
will
not
always
be
appropriate.
the
trial
judge
must
have
considerable
leeway
in
determining
how
to
go
about
determining
whether
the
particular
expert
testimony
is
reliable,
and
the
judge
should
consider
the
specific
factors
where
there
are
reasonable
measures
of
reliability.
third,
the
trial
judge
must
have
the
same
kind
of
legal
attitude
in
deciding
how
to
test
an
expert’s
reliability,
what
kind
of
procedures
to
have,
as
the
trial
judge
enjoys
when
he
decides
or
he/she
decides
whether
that
expert’s
relevant
testimony
is
reliable.
on
review
for
that
decision
an
abusive
discretion
standard
will
apply.
then
finally,
our
opinion
to
show
an
example
of
the
principles
i
just
discussed,
it
reviews
in
detail
the
specific
decision
at
issue
here,
namely
the
decision
about
this
tire
failure
expert.
i
think
i
will
spare
you
with
details
in
this
oral
statement
of
tire
failure
analysis,
so
the
briefs
run
into
that
matter
rather
thoroughly,
and
thus
we
learned
quite
a
lot
about
that.
it
is
a
very
interesting
subject,
and
lot
of
rich
detail
there.
after
examining
the
record
we
conclude
that
the
trial
court’s
decision
to
apply
the
specific
daubert
factor
here
and
to
exclude
the
testimony,
those
decisions
were
reasonable
ones
and
therefore
lawful
ones.
because
we
agree
with
the
district
court’s
conclusion
and
because
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
agree
with
that
conclusion,
we
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals.
justice
scalia
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion
in
which
justices
o’connor
and
thomas
join;
justice
stevens
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
part
and
dissenting
in
part.
