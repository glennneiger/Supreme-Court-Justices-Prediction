ms.
deborah
labelle
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
would
first
like
to
just
clarify
briefly
one
of
the
inquiries
of
justice
o'connor
and
that
in
this
case,
both
in
the
glover
and
hadix,
the
defendants
have
paid
at
pre-plra
rates
all
of
the
fees
up
to
the
date
of
enactment
of
the
act.
the
way
that
happened
is
the--
ms.
deborah
labelle
--up
through
april
26th,
1996.
ms.
deborah
labelle
yes.
they
did
not
seek
review
of
the
sixth
circuit's
prior
opinions
in
both
hadix
and
glover
awarding
specifically
that
pre-enactment--
ms.
deborah
labelle
--absent
this
court
ruling
that
defendants,
which
they
sought
to
come
back
and
get
those
fees
back,
yes.
they've
already
paid
them
and
before
the
sixth
circuit
and
at
the
later
opinion
they
asked
that
they
be
able
to
go
back
and
reclaim
them.
ms.
deborah
labelle
they
did
contest
them.
they
paid
them
because
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed
the
district
court
and
they
did
not
seek
review
of
that.
ms.
deborah
labelle
that's
correct.
ms.
deborah
labelle
that's
correct,
your
honor.
and
clarifying
one
other
point--
ms.
deborah
labelle
--it
is
true
that
they
have
paid
all
those
monies.
ms.
deborah
labelle
correct.
ms.
deborah
labelle
i
don't
know
the
answer
to
that
question.
ms.
deborah
labelle
they
challenged
it
in
the
sixth
circuit,
but
the
sixth
circuit
ruled
that
they
had
to
pay
it.
they
did
not
seek
review
of
that
prior
opinion.
it
was
the
subsequent
opinion
which
covered
both
pre
and
post
awards,
pre
and
post
fee
awards,
that
they
sought
review
of
and
that
is
before
this
court
now.
ms.
deborah
labelle
because
the
original
opinion
dealt
with
a
time
period
way
before
the
passage
of
the
act
from
june
1995
through
december
1995,
which
the
court,
because
they
contested
some
other
matters,
didn't
hold
a
hearing
and
get
around
to
awarding
until
after
the
passage
of
the
act.
therefore,
they
said,
okay,
it's
an
award
for
fees
from
june
through
december
1995.
now
we
want
to
apply
the
plra.
subsequent
to
that
came
a
time
period
of
january
'96
through
june
'96
which
encompassed
both
pre
and
post
enactment
hours.
and
that
is
the
matter
which
they
sought
review
and
is
before
the
court.
for
whatever
reason,
they
decided
that
when
the
sixth
circuit
ruled
even
as
to
that
matter
to
pay
all
of
the
fees
up
through
april
1996
at
the
pre-plra
rate.
ms.
deborah
labelle
i
think
that
it's
not
before
the
court--
ms.
deborah
labelle
--mr.
chief
justice,
because
they
paid
all
of
those
fees,
did
not
contest
them,
did
not...
did
not
contest
them
at
the
time
of
paying
it,
did
not
say
we
retain
the
right,
and
in
fact,
did
not
seek
in
their
petition
for
review
before
this
court
to
review
that
matter.
ms.
deborah
labelle
yes.
ms.
deborah
labelle
it's
not
in
their
cert
petition,
your
honor,
and
this
court
then
issued
them
the
two
questions
splitting
the
matter.
ms.
deborah
labelle
and,
your
honor,
i
think
that
there's
a
good
reason
actually
to
include
both
in
this
court's
inquiry
because
i
do
not
think
that
the
statute,
by
the
language
of
the
statute
itself,
allows
for
the
distinction.
and
in
fact,
that's
one
of
the
problems.
ms.
deborah
labelle
i
do
not
know
if
it's
in
the
record,
your
honor,
in
the
joint
appendix.
the
decision...
the
prior
decision
of
the
court
is
in
there,
and
i
would
have
to
look
at
the
joint
appendix
to
see
if
there
is
a
specific
notation
of
them
paying
it.
i
don't
think
it
was
included
in
their
joint
appendix,
your
honor.
ms.
deborah
labelle
yes,
it's
certainly--
ms.
deborah
labelle
--yes,
your
honor.
it's
certainly
in
that
record.
i
would...
i
would
like
to
address
the
fact
that
we
think
that
the...
the
plain
language
of
the
statute
at
issue
here
does
not
evince
a
congressional
intent
with
regard
to
its
temporal
reach.
however,
if
you
apply
this
court's
other
general
rules
of
statutory
interpretation,
there
are
several
bases
for
concluding
that
congress
intended
the
statute
only
to
apply
to
actions
brought
after
the
passage
of
the
act
because,
while
congress
did
not
state
in
any--
ms.
deborah
labelle
--i
think
that's
correct,
your
honor,
to
an
action
brought
after
the
passage
of
the
act.
and
it
does
not
apply
to
pending
cases
because,
while
this
court
has,
certainly
in
landgraf,
told
congress
that
if
they
want
to
apply
things
to
pending
cases,
they
should
clearly
make
that
evident
in
the
language
of
the
statute.
here
congress
did
in
one
section
of
the
statute,
in
802,
clearly
say
that
this
applies
to
pending
cases.
what
they--
ms.
deborah
labelle
--i
think
that's
true,
your
honor.
i
think
that
in
landgraf
the
court
set
out
some
narrow
lines
in
saying
in
purely
procedural
matters,
for
example,
or
in
matters
that
have
occurred
in
the
past,
that...
in
purely
procedural
matters,
that
this
court
would
not
have
a
presumption
against
retroactivity.
ms.
deborah
labelle
but
i
think,
your
honor,
mr.
chief
justice,
what
we're
talking
about
here
is
that
the
way
these
cases
were
filed
were
based
upon
a
reliance
on
the
act
that
existed
at
that
time
and
which
this
statute
amends.
and
the...
the
understanding
at
that
time
is
that
if
you
bring
these
cases...
and
in
fact,
congress
evoked
the
act
to
induce
parties
to
bring
these
cases
and
attorneys
to
represent
these
parties
who
didn't
have
the
wherewithal
to
challenge
their
constitutional
rights
in
any
other
manner...
if
you
bring
these
cases,
you
will
have
an
entitlement
to
reasonable
attorney
fees.
ms.
deborah
labelle
that's
correct,
your
honor,
but
that
is
exactly
the
balancing
act
that
goes
on
when
a
case
is
filed.
you
know
that
you
may
not
win,
but
if
you
do
win--
ms.
deborah
labelle
--well,
i
want
to
distinguish
two
things.
the
facts
of
this
case
which,
in
fact,
the
court
did
rule
in
both
of
these
cases
that
you
would
for
your
future
work
have
an
entitlement
to
attorney
fees
at
a
set
market
rate.
and
these
are
orders
in
both
of
these
cases
establishing
at
that
time
that
you
would
have
150
dollars
an
hour.
it
was
the
market
rate
established.
ms.
deborah
labelle
that
the
congress,
your
honor,
can
say
that...
that
that...
that
fees
worked...
congress
can
say
that,
your
honor,
but
i
don't
think
they
said
it
in
this
act.
and
i
think
that
that's
an
important
point.
what
the
congress
did
say
is
they
said...
in
802,
they
said,
yes,
it's
going
to
apply
to
pending
cases,
and
in
fact
in
a
case
where
it
involves
specifically
prospective
relief.
in
a
prospective
relief,
which
i
think
has
a
little
more
ambiguity
as
to
whether
that
applies
anyway,
the
retroactive
analysis,
but
congress
there
said
it
will
apply
in
802.
it
did
not
have
that
language
in
803,
and
it
did
something
more
significant.
it
took--
ms.
deborah
labelle
--well--
ms.
deborah
labelle
--or
what
will
be
covered
is
three
things
because
i
don't
think
you
can
separate
the
act.
what
will
be
covered
is
fees
worked
prior
to
the
passage
of
the
act
by
the
language
of
the
act,
which
were
worked
under
an
entitlement,
an
order
of
the
court
saying
you
will
be
entitled
to
future
monitoring
fees
at
this
rate.
and
i
do
want
to
note
and
clarify
for
the
court,
the
way
the
court
has
always
awarded
fees
is
for
future
fees.
defendants
have
always
fought
the
concept
that
we
can
then...
at
the
time
we
are
petitioning
for
fees,
we
could
raise
the
rate
and
get
it
for
the
time
worked.
defendants
have
said
no,
and
the
court
has
agreed.
only
work--
ms.
deborah
labelle
--that's
correct.
that's
what
would
happen.
ms.
deborah
labelle
the...
i
think
that
if
you
go
by
the
language
of
the
statute,
it
doesn't
allow
parsing
the
statute
in
that
manner
because
it
speaks
in
terms
of
any
action
brought
by
a
prisoner
who
is
incarcerated,
the
court...
fees
shall
not
be
awarded
except
to
the
extent
that.
and
it
does
not
have,
as
any
of
its
delineation,
hours
worked,
when
the
hours
are
worked,
what
the
time
period,
and
so
it's--
ms.
deborah
labelle
--i
think
that
it
is
a
simple
line
to
draw,
your
honor,
but
i
don't
think
congress
drew
that
line.
and
i...
i
think
that
what--
ms.
deborah
labelle
--the
district
court
drew
that
line,
your
honor,
finding
that
not
that
the
statute's
wording
provided
that,
but
that
there
would
be
a
retroactive...
an
impermissible
retroactive
effect
if
you
got
past
the
congressional
intent--
ms.
deborah
labelle
--i
think
because
what
we're
looking
at
is
what
is
the
conduct
and
what
is
the
triggering
event
here,
what
is
the
event
you
look
at
for
purposes
of
determining
whether
it
has
that
kind
of
effect.
ms.
deborah
labelle
because
the
attorney
fees...
first,
the
attorney
fees
are
only
provided
if
you
prevail
in
a
litigation
that
you've
filed
under
the
prior
act.
in
terms--
ms.
deborah
labelle
--in
this
case
you're
talking
about
the
monitoring
arrangements,
but
certainly
if
it's
allowed
to
apply,
it
will
apply
to
cases
in
which
have
not
yet
prevailed
and
which
work
has
performed.
the
statute
comes
in
in
between
filing
the
case
and
prevailing.
and
then
the...
at
that
time...
and
there
are
a
number
of
cases
certainly
out
there
in
which
it's
before
prevailing
in
which
you
file
the
case
with
the
understanding
that
if
you
did
vindicate
the
constitutional
rights
of
your
client,
that
you
would
obtain
reasonable
fees.
ms.
deborah
labelle
because
i
think
that
it
does
unsettle
expectations
and
disrupt
and
injure
the
client
in
a
way
that
it
should
not,
in
the
sense
that
what
the
attorney
may
do
in
that
case,
who
has
committed
to
the
client
to
represent
them,
is
withdraw.
it's
the--
ms.
deborah
labelle
--but
this
does
not
provide
for
a
reasonable
fee
now.
this
caps
the
fee
at
a
certain
rate,
which
is
not
a
reasonable
fee.
ms.
deborah
labelle
i
think
defendants
would,
your
honor,
because--
ms.
deborah
labelle
--i
think--
ms.
deborah
labelle
--i
think
it's
true.
i
don't
think
this
court
needs
to
get
to
the
retroactivity
analysis
because
you
only
get
there
if
you
find
that
there
is...
it's
not
clear
what
congressional
intent
was.
ms.
deborah
labelle
well,
i
think
that
in
some
sense
this
is
a
flip
side
of
landgraf
in
which
the
court
said
there
that
although
it
was
just
potential,
that
you
could
not
tell...
you
could
not
grant
or
extend
a
potential
benefit
to...
to
the
plaintiff,
a
right
of
compensation,
that
had
the
potential
of
extending
the
liability
of
the
defendant
after
the
case
had
been
filed.
and
in
this
case,
what
you're
doing
is
you're
decreasing
the
entitlement
to
the
plaintiff
in
such
a
way
not
just
with
fees,
your
honor--
ms.
deborah
labelle
--well,
i
think
you're
talking
about,
mr.
chief
justice,
more
than
compensation
of
the
attorneys,
both...
for
two
reasons.
one,
the
statute,
which
also
controls...
is...
is
controlled.
the
subsection
of
the
statute
also
talks
about
the
damages
to
the
client.
in
this
act,
what
it
says
is
that
in
any
awards
in
any
case
brought,
the
party
also
loses
a
portion
of
their
damages
and
has
to
move
those
damages
over
to
pay
for--
ms.
deborah
labelle
--it's
not
involved
here,
but
it's
necessitated
by
this
court's
opinion
because
they
are
both...
both
subsections
are
under,
in
any
case
brought,
fees
shall
not
be
awarded
except
to
the
extent
that,
and
one
is...
sets
the
cap
on
attorney
fees.
ms.
deborah
labelle
i
think
that
the
lawyer
could
withdraw,
but
then
the
concern
comes
in
terms
of
the
effect
on
the
client
who
is
now
deprived
of
the
lawyer
with
the
experience
and
the
ability--
ms.
deborah
labelle
--i
think,
your
honor,
it
probably...
i
think
it
does
involve
ethical
concerns
certainly,
especially
in
the
circumstance
where
you
would
be
saying
whether
you
should
withdraw
because
it's
overwhelming
you
in
terms
of
the...
the
financial
burden
where
you
know
that
it
is
unlikely
to
have
any
other...
to
get
any
other
counsel
to
represent
the
client.
ms.
deborah
labelle
i
think
that
the
monitoring,
your
honor,
came
in
only
after,
in
the
glover
case,
the
sixth
circuit
found
these
defendants
in
omnibus
contempt
of
the
court's
orders
and
then
ordered
a
development
of
a
plan
that
actually
complied
with
the
court's
orders.
ms.
deborah
labelle
the
order
of
the
sixth
circuit
initial
one
was
in
1991,
and
the
district
court
subsequently
in
1995
found
again
that
defendants
were
not
complying
and
were
in
contempt.
the...
it
has
not
been,
at
least
in
the
glover
case,
ongoing
monitoring.
there
was
a
period
in
which
everyone
expected
the
defendants
to
obey
the
court's
orders
and
it
was
only
after
5
or
6
years
in
which
no
action
was
done,
that
the
parties
for
the
class
of
women
prisoners
came
back
in
and
said,
excuse
me,
we
don't
have
any
compliance
here.
and
then
that
started
again
the
contempt
and
the
monitoring
award.
ms.
deborah
labelle
that's
correct.
ms.
deborah
labelle
yes,
it
did,
your
honor.
ms.
deborah
labelle
the
fees
are
the
fees
of
the
client.
ms.
deborah
labelle
i
think
in...
in
these
cases
that
what
happens
when
they
are
filed
is
that
the...
it
is
the
party
that
has
a
right
to,
under
the
act
prior
to
this
amendment,
reasonable
attorney
fees
and--
ms.
deborah
labelle
--i
think
that's
true,
your
honor,
but
this...
this
statute
does
more.
it
takes
from
the
party
up
to
25
percent
of
their
damages
when
they
win,
and
it's
found
that
they
are
the
victims
of
constitutional
violations
and
says
you
must
turn
that
portion
of
your
damages
over
to
pay
the
defendant's
obligation
to
pay
attorney
fees.
so,
it
certainly
does
affect
the
party
in
a
way
more
than
just
paying
the
lawyers.
they
must
now,
under
this
subsection,
pay
up
to
25
percent
of
any
damages
awarded
to
them
to
offset
the
award
to
the
wrongdoer,
the
defendant
in
this
case,
as
obligation
for
attorney
fees.
so--
ms.
deborah
labelle
--i
think
that
in...
the
most
significant
awards
do
occur
in
situations
of
wrongful
death
and
in
rapes.
certainly
that's
my
familiarity,
more
in
the
women's
prison
situation.
there
are--
ms.
deborah
labelle
--there
are
cases
brought
as
class
and
as
individuals,
your
honor,
addressing
both
where
there
is
a
pervasive
condition
that
is
alleged.
but
i
think
in...
in
the
general
situation
where
there
are
damages,
i
would
agree
that
in
general
they
are
brought
in
individual
circumstances.
ms.
deborah
labelle
if
the
statute
had
the
same
evolution,
your
honor,
and
the
procedure
that
i
think
we
have
here,
where
congress
took
that
section
out
of
a
section
that
applied
to
pending
cases
and
put
it
in
a
section
that
did
not
and
did
not
specify
that
it
applied
to
pending
cases,
i
think
that
you
would
have
to
use
your
general
rules
of
statutory
interpretation
to
say
that
congress
did
not
intend
it
to
apply
to
pending
cases.
ms.
deborah
labelle
yes.
ms.
deborah
labelle
the
answer
is
yes.
ms.
deborah
labelle
it
would
work
both
ways,
your
honor,
because
it
would...
in
that
circumstance
i
would
not
argue
that
the
defendants
who
also
work
under
these
circumstances
with
the
knowledge
as
to
what
the
fees
would
be
should
have
to,
in
pending
cases,
then
have
to
reassess
that
and
now
be
told
not
that
it
will
be
market
rate,
but
that
it
might
be
double
market
rate,
and
especially
in
circumstances
where
they
can't
go
back
and
change
their
conduct,
as
is
urged
here,
where
we
worked
under
an
entitlement
of
a
court
order
to
what
had
been
defined
as
market
rate
and
performed
that
work,
and
then
the
act
came
into
effect.
and
so
that
certainly
we
can't
alter
and
we
can't
go
back
and
make
a
decision
whether
to
withdraw.
but...
but
i
would
think
that
here,
where
congress...
i
think
that
although
i
do
believe
that
there
is
a
retroactive
effect
on
the
parties
by
applying
this
act
to
cases
that
are
pending,
i
think
that
congress...
you
don't
need
to
get
to
that
if
you
look
at
what
congress
did
here.
ms.
deborah
labelle
your
honor,
if...
perhaps
in
cases
where
you're
in
monitoring,
but
that
would
not
be
the
way--
ms.
deborah
labelle
--correct,
but
this
would
also
apply
to
cases
where
attorneys
are
in
midstream
on
a
case,
where
they
started
the
case
under
the
understanding
that
they
would
get
those
fees.
ms.
deborah
labelle
i
think,
your
honor,
the
answer
to
some
extent
is
not
x
dollars
an
hour,
but
prevailing
party,
yes,
that
you
will
not
suffer--
ms.
deborah
labelle
--i
think
in
these
difficult
cases,
it
is
the
background
principle,
that
if
in
these
difficult
cases,
you
do
prevail,
you
will
not...
it
will
not
be
a
punishment.
you
will...
you're
not
sacrificing
other
work
in
order
to
do
these
cases.
ms.
deborah
labelle
i
think
that
it
has...
it
has
been
determined
both
by
hensley
and
in
the
precedents
in...
in
the
district
circuit
that
we
practice
in,
that
it
is
the
prevailing
market
rate
in
the
community
in
which
you
practice.
ms.
deborah
labelle
thank
you.
