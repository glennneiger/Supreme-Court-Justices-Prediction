mr.
thomas
l.
casey
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
congress
intended
the
plra
attorney's
fee
cap
to
apply
to
cases
precisely
like
the
two
before
the
court
this
morning.
congress
intended
not
only
to
limit
frivolous
claims
in
cases
and
to
limit
federal
court
involvement
in
the
details
of
state
prison
management,
but
it
also
intended
to
relieve
states
of
some
of
the
financial
burden
of
such
cases
and,
in
particular,
some
of
the
financial
burden
of
attorney's
fees
ancillary
to
such
cases.
42
u.s.c.
1988
provides
that
a
district
court
may
allow
reasonable
fees
to
prevailing
parties.
the
plra,
in
effect,
has
defined
prevailing
party
and
reasonable
fee.
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
that's
correct.
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
my
understanding
is
that
it
is
a
common
practice.
once
a
consent
decree
or
a
judgment
after
trial
has
been
entered,
the
district
court
frequently
retains
jurisdiction
to
monitor
compliance.
remedial
orders
are
entered,
and
the
court
monitors
compliance.
in
michigan,
we've
had
these
remedial
orders--
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
--the
state
pays
for
it.
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
the
court
has
in
one
case
determined
after
trial
and
in
another
case
by
consent
decree
that
there
has
been
constitutional
violations
sufficient
to
require
the
defendant
to
make...
to
rectify
the
constitutional
violations.
in
this
case--
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
--your
honor--
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
--the
states
have
objected
loudly
and
long
against
that
practice,
and
now
in
the
plra,
congress
has
directed
its
attention
to
it.
and
in--
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
--not
in
this
case,
no.
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
that's
correct.
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
we
filed
a
supplemental
brief
a
few
weeks
ago,
your
honor.
in
the
glover
case,
6
months
ago
or
so
the
circuit
court
remanded
the
case
to
the
district
court
with
instructions
to
make
findings
as
to
whether
there
are
current
violations.
the
district
court
has
now
made
those
findings,
has
found
that
there
are
no
current
violations,
and
has
terminated
its
jurisdiction.
the
sixth
circuit
had
retained
jurisdiction,
so
now
briefs
are
scheduled
to
be
filed.
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
yes.
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
yes.
i
believe
that
termination
of
the
suit
does
not
moot
out
the
current
attorney
fee
requests.
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
yes.
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
there
have
been.
we
have
unsuccessfully
appealed
portions
of
it.
the
case
most
recently
was
remanded
from
the
sixth
circuit
back
to
the
district
court
for
further
proceedings
to
determine
whether
there
are
current
constitutional
violations.
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
the
mechanism
for
attorney's
fees
in
these
cases
was
that
each
6
months
the
plaintiffs'
attorneys
would
submit
a
request
for
attorney's
fees.
we
would
make
objections,
as
we
saw
appropriate,
and
then
the
district
court
would
enter
an
order.
so--
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
--that's
correct.
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
there
is
a
period
of
4
months
where
we
are
challenging.
the
fee
cycle
started
january
1
of
1996,
and
we
are
asserting
that
the
determinative
date
under
the
plra
is
the
date
of
the
award.
and
the
cycle
that
is
at
issue
is
for
the
6
months
starting
december
of
1996.
the
plra
took
effect,
as
you
say,
in
april
of
1996.
so,
we
have
in
michigan--
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
--that's
correct.
we
have
not
paid
the
entire
fee.
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
correct.
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
one
was
filed
in
1977
and
the
other
in
1980.
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
they
were,
indeed,
your
honor,
and
the
sixth
circuit
stated
that
in
one
of
its
opinions,
which
we've
quoted
in
the
brief.
particularly
since--
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
as...
as
the
case
is
postured
now,
we
are
only
dealing
with
the
attorney
fee
cap
in
section
803(d)(3)
of
the
plra.
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
for
an
award
which
has
not
been
liquidated
and
finalized,
we
believe
that
the
plra
would
apply.
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
we...
we
are
not
seeking
to
reopen
old--
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
--yes.
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
oh,
yes.
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
some
of
it
is--
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
--well,
as...
as
this
court
has
told
us
in
landgraf,
you
first
look
to
see
if
congress
has
made
a
clear
statement
about
its
intention,
and
to
do
that,
you
first
look
at
the
text
of
the
statute
and
the
legislative
history.
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
we
believe
that
the
text
of
the
statute
does
clearly
show
congress'
intent
that
it
apply
to
pending
cases.
section
803(d)(1)
refers
to
in
any
action
brought
by
a
prisoner
who
is
confined.
those
are
words
of
the
present
tense.
we
believe
they
apply
to
pending
cases.
in
hutto
v.
finney,
this
court
said
of
similar
language
in
section
1988
that
the
words
any
action
could
not
be
broader
and
contained
no
hint
of
an
exception.
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
that's
correct.
we
are
not
saying
that
any
individual
word
here
by
itself
is
determinative.
to
determine
the
intent,
you
must
look
at
the
entire
statute.
there
are
three
subsections:
the
one
i've
just
read
and
also
section
803(d)(3),
which
says
no
award
of
attorney
fees
shall
be
greater
than
100
percent.
again,
these
are
all
encompassing
words.
no
award
we
say
means
no
award.
thirdly,
the
definition
of
prisoner
in
section
8038
says
any
person
incarcerated
who
is
convicted
or
sentenced
for.
again,
words
in
the
present
tense
which
are
all-encompassing
and
contain
no
exception
and
no
limitation
to
solely
prospective
application.
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
section
802
of
the
plra
was
an
amendment
to
the
code
of
criminal
procedure,
18
u.s.c.
3626.
in
that
section,
the...
there
is
an
explicit
statement
that
section
802
applies
to
pending
cases.
we
believe
that
congress
knew
after
this
court's
opinion
in
landgraf
that
in
order
to
make
that
section
apply
to
pending
cases,
they
had
to
do
it
explicitly
because
that
was
a
substantive
section.
it
applied
to
the
relief
to
which
plaintiffs
would
be
entitled
and
to
terminating
current
relief.
the
sections
that
we
are
talking
about,
particularly
section
803(d),
we
submit
is
more
of
a
procedural
than
a
substantive
section.
all
of
the
sections
of
the
plra,
except
section
802,
are
sort
of
a
grab
bag
of
different
kinds
of
statutes.
they
deal
with
such
things
as
filing
fees,
exhaustion
of
administrative
remedies.
we
have
the
attorney
fee
provision.
there
is
a--
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
--that
is
one
of
the
factors
the
court
identified
in
landgraf.
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
section
802
is...
is
not
at
issue
here.
what--
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
--yes.
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
that's
correct.
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
that's
correct.
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
we
say
it
applies
to
all
awards
made
after
the
effect
of
the
statute.
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
that
is
our
contention,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
yes.
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
yes.
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
our
position
is
that
the
plaintiffs
and
their
attorneys
do
not
have
a
reasonable
expectation
in
a
particular
rate.
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
the
most
that
they--
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
--well,
i
disagree
with
that,
your
honor.
in
fact,
there
have
been
many
changes
in
the
fees
paid
here.
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
every
6
months
plaintiffs
submit
a
bill
for
their
expenses,
and
at
that
time
they
say
what
they
want
their
fee
to
be.
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
correct.
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
they
submitted
a...
a
bill
for
fees
for
january
1
through
june
of
'96.
they
are
asking
for
an
increase
in
the
rate
of
pay
from
150
dollars
to
200
dollars
an
hour
because
that
they
say
is
the
prevailing
market
rate.
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
yes.
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
that
is...
that
is--
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
--i
don't
believe
there
have
been
any
instances
like
that.
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
but
there--
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
--our
position
is
that
that
floor
is
subject
to
change.
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
of
course.
the
district--
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
--that's
correct.
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
yes.
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
that's...
that's
correct.
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
yes.
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
that's
correct.
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
if,
for
example,
the
economy
went
into
a
depression--
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
--if
there
was
a...
if
there
was
a
decrease
in
the
prevailing
market
rate
of
attorney
fees,
then
the
plaintiffs
in
one
of
their
6-month
cycles
would
be
entitled
to
a
lesser
amount
than
they
received
the
preceding
cycle.
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
because
under
their
view,
the
prevailing
market
rate
would
have...
instead
of
being
150
dollars
an
hour,
say
it
was
100
dollars
an
hour.
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
under...
under
1988--
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
--that's
correct.
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
that's
correct.
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
for
a
particular
fee
cycle,
yes.
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
i
don't
believe
for
the
future,
no.
for
the
billing
cycle
that
was
before
the
court.
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
which
was
past.
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
it's
my
understanding.
we
certainly
never
agreed
to
any
order
which
would
say
that
plaintiffs
are
henceforth
entitled
to
a
particular
amount.
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
on
the
date
of
the
award.
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
yes.
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
i
don't
think
it
was
articulated
in
those
terms
in
front
of
the
district
court.
it
was
essentially
every
6
months,
they
would
submit
a
bill.
we
would
object.
but
i...
i
don't
think
we
got
into
this
level
of
subtlety.
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
we
are
not--
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
--yes.
section
1988--
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
--of
course,
and
what
we
are
saying
is
that
all
the
plaintiffs
are
entitled
to
is
a
reasonable
fee
on
the
date
of
the
award,
and
that
reasonable
fee
changes.
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
we
do
take
that
position.
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
the
court
has
specified--
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
--the
court
has
specified
two
issues:
one
for
work
performed
before
the
date
of
the
plra
and
one
for
work
performed
after
the
date
of
the
plra.
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
we
say
that
the
date
of
the
award
is
the
operative
date.
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
the
statute
applies
to
all
awards
after
the
effective
date
of
the
statute
regardless
of
when
the
work
was
performed.
that
is
our
position.
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
that's
correct.
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
i
think
a
stronger
argument
can
be
made
for
work
performed
after
the
date
of
the
statute.
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
they
would
need
the
court's
permission,
but
yes,
they
could
seek
it.
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
yes,
yes.
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
they
were
the
plaintiff
class
counsel
from
the
beginning
of
the
lawsuit,
and
i
don't
believe
they
could
unilaterally
just
withdraw
at
this
point.
the
court
would
have
to...
i
assume
would
look
to
see
if
there
is
substitute
counsel
available
and
make
sure--
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
--no.
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
no.
these
are...
these
are
private
counsel.
they're
not
appointed
by
the...
by
the
court.
again,
we
think
you
look
to
the
relevant
activity
affected
by
this
statute
and
that
is
the
award
of
attorney
fees.
and
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time.
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
my
understanding
is
that
every
6
months,
they
submit
a
bill
and
they
ask
to
be
paid
at
a
certain
rate
for
that
work
which
was
performed
in
the
past.
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
correct.
i
do
not
believe
the
orders
say
that.
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
yes.
what
legislative
history
there
is
available
is
focused
on
these
consent
decree
cases
which
go
on
for
decades,
not
just
in
michigan's,
although
michigan's
cases
were
specifically
mentioned
because
senator--
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
--i
don't
know.
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
there
was
a
letter
introduced
into
the
record
from
the
national
association
of
attorneys
general
which
indicated
i
believe
54
cases
as
of
1994,
but
i
do
not
know
how
many...
michigan
has
4
pending--
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
--that's
correct.
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
that's
correct.
and
the
problem,
as
congress
recognized
in
the
plra,
is
that
district
courts
have
gotten
bogged
down
in
the
minutia
of
management.
the
sixth
circuit
in
hadix
in
an
opinion
we've
included
at
page
164
of
our
brief,
in
which
they
remanded
the
case
back
to
the
district
court,
pointed
out
that
the
district
court
had
gotten
bogged
down
in
the
minutia
of
remedial
activities
rather
than
focusing
on
the
alleged
constitutional
violations.
they
sent
the
case
back
to
the
district
court
and
they
said
just
determine
whether
there
is
a
current
constitutional
violation.
the
district
court
examined
it,
found
no
current
violations,
and
now
that
case
will
be
dismissed.
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
correct.
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
monitoring
has
been--
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
--going
on
for
15
or
19
years.
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
the
orders
of
the
court
are
included
in
the
joint
appendix.
if
they're
not
all
in
the
joint
appendix,
then
certainly
they
would
be--
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
--yes,
i
believe
so.
i
believe
so,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
i
don't
know
specifically
over
the
past
22
years.
for
the
four
cases,
consent
decree
cases,
class
actions
we
have
pending
now,
the
difference,
if
the
plra
limit
applies,
for
'96
through
june
of
'98
is
550,000
dollars
apparently.
