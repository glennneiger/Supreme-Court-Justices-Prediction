unknown
speaker
mr.
casey,
some
of
the
fees
in
this
case
are
not...
reasonable
fees
to
prevailing
party.
i
normally
think
it
applies
to
the...
the
fees
that
have
been
expended
in
the
course
of
the
litigation
before
the
judgment.
but
some
of
these
fees
were
for
the
purpose
of
policing
the
injunction
after
it
was
issued?
unknown
speaker
the
attorneys'
efforts
undertaken
in...
do
the
courts
have
the
power
to
do
that,
to
sort
of
hire,
you
know,
a
private
marshals
force
to...
to
see
that
their
injunctions
are
being
complied
with?
is
this
a
common
practice?
i
frankly
was
unaware
of
it.
unknown
speaker
oh,
i
now
it
monitors
compliance,
but--
--who
pays
for
it?
--who
pays
for
it?
that's--
unknown
speaker
--why
is
that?
unknown
speaker
well,
that's
fine.
and
if
they
should...
if
they
should
commit
the
violation
again
and
you
should
sue
again,
then
i
assume
the
attorney's
fees
expended
in
demonstrating
that
they
continued
the
violation
would
be
fees
expended
by
the
prevailing
party
in
that
later
litigation.
but
once
litigation
has
been
completed,
the...
the
injunction
has...
has
issued,
i...
i
find
it...
i
find
it
extraordinary--
unknown
speaker
--that
you
can
hire
attorneys
to...
to
oversee
the...
the
prisons
for...
for
the
court.
unknown
speaker
well,
that...
that
feature
colors
my
whole
view
of
this
case,
and
i'm...
i'm
worried
that...
that
how
i
come
out
in
this
case
is...
is
going
to
be
dependent
on
a...
on
a
practice
that
i'm
not
sure
is
even...
is
even
authorized.
but
there's...
there's
no
challenge
to
that
here
i
gather.
unknown
speaker
would
you
give
us
a
little
more
background?
there
are
two
cases
here:
one
in
class
actions
i
take
it,
one
involving
female
prisoners
and
one
male
prisoners?
unknown
speaker
in
both
cases
is
there
still
an
ongoing
monitoring
or
has
one
of
them
been
concluded
at
last?
unknown
speaker
well,
now
on...
on
that
one,
do
we
have
an
issue
remaining
as
to
attorney's
fees
for
monitoring
in
the
glover
case--
unknown
speaker
--post
plra
and
until
the
termination
of
the
suit?
unknown
speaker
and...
and
the
hadix
suit
is
one
where
there
is
still
an
ongoing
monitoring?
unknown
speaker
and
there's
been
no
petition
to
end
that
one?
unknown
speaker
now,
one
other
housekeeping
sort
of
question.
has
the
state
paid
all
the
fees
to
the
attorneys
for
monitoring
up
to
the
effective
date
of
the
plra?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
asked
a
pretty
simple
question.
i...
i
thought
plra
became
effective
april
26th,
1996.
is
that
right?
unknown
speaker
has
the
state
paid
the
attorney's
fees
up
to
that
date?
unknown
speaker
so,
the
answer
is
that
the
state
has
not
paid
everything.
unknown
speaker
up
to
the
effective
date.
unknown
speaker
would
you
tell
how
long
each
of
these
two
cases
has
been
going
on?
unknown
speaker
so,
they
were
cash
cows,
in
effect,
weren't
they?
unknown
speaker
well,
the
record
before
us
of
the
extent
of
the
violations
of
the
injunction...
we
don't
know
that.
it
may
be
that
these...
that
there
were
consistent
violations
and
the
monitoring
was
necessary
so
that
the
officials
would
abide
by
the
court's
orders.
so,
but
that's...
the
sole
issue
here
is
how
much
per
hour,
as
i
understand
it,
and
not
whether
these
injunctive
decrees
were
needed.
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
just
one
other
question?
your...
your
position
is
that
the
date
of
the
award
governs.
supposing
there's
an
award
before
the
statute
was
passed,
but
you
challenged
it
and
appealed
it,
and
then
it
became
final
after
the
statute
was
passed,
how
would
you
deal
with
that?
unknown
speaker
i
see.
unknown
speaker
i
understand
that,
but
i
just--
--is
there
any...
i
mean,
the
common
sense
of
this
i
guess
would
be
congress
passes
a
statute
saying
put
a
cap
on
rates.
all
right?
unknown
speaker
somebody
who
knew
nothing
about
it
would
say,
i
guess
they
mean
that
the
cap
applies
to
people
for
future
work,
and
it
doesn't
apply
for
past
work.
all
right.
i
guess
knowing
nothing
about
it,
that's
what
i
would
say.
now,
why
is
it
knowing
a
lot
about
it,
i'd
have
to
say
something
else?
[laughter]
well,
some
of
this
is
future
work.
i
mean,
lest--
unknown
speaker
--lest
it
be
thought
the--
unknown
speaker
--i
mean,
i
assume
you're
not
going
to
object
to
that
part
of
it,
but
the...
the
common
sense...
what
i
think
is
the
common
sense
of
it.
and
the
other
part--
unknown
speaker
--well,
the
statute
here
doesn't
say
anything
about
what
is
supposed
to
happen.
it
just
says
there
is
this
cap
on
attorney's
fees,
and
we
know
it
became
effective
in
april
of
1996.
isn't
that
right?
that's
all
we
know
from
looking
at
the
statute.
unknown
speaker
of
course,
the
word
brought
was
not
in
that
statute.
unknown
speaker
and
yet,
there
is
another
section
that
does
state
it
is
to
be
retrospectively
applicable,
and
this
section
that
we're
dealing
with
conspicuously
does
not
contain
any
such
explicit
instruction.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
don't
understand
the
principle
you're
espousing,
that
all
procedural
things...
i
don't
understand.
the
line
between
retroactivity
and
non-retroactivity
or
between
a
presumption
of
retroactivity
and
a
non-presumption
of
retroactivity
is
the
same
as
the
line
between
substance
and
procedure?
unknown
speaker
i
thought
that...
that
the
distinctive
feature
of
802(b)(1)
is
the
fact
that
it
says
it
shall
apply
with
respect
to
all
prospective
relief
whether
such
relief
was
originally
granted
or
approved
before,
on,
or
after
the
date
of
enactment
of
this
title.
i
mean,
that...
that
is
a
degree
of
retroactivity,
admitted
retroactivity.
you're
not
arguing
for
retroactivity
here,
are
you?
you...
you
don't
think
that
this
applies
before.
unknown
speaker
no,
but
that's
the
section
we're
comparing
it
with.
we're
saying
that
802
has
this
explicit
statement.
unknown
speaker
and
it
seems
to
me
the
explicit
statement
was
necessary
in
802
to
make
it
clear
that
802
was
retroactive.
unknown
speaker
that
is,
it
applied
to
matters
before
the
date
of
enactment
of
this
title.
unknown
speaker
you
don't
assert
that
803
applies
to
matters
before
the
date
of
this
title.
you
just...
you
just
assert
that
it
applies
to
all
fees
awarded.
unknown
speaker
right.
but
it
does
apply
to
awards
made
for
work
done
before
the
date
of
the
statute.
unknown
speaker
let's
assume,
for
the
sake
of
argument,
that
i
don't
think
the...
the
text
really
answers
the
question
so
that
we
have
to
go
to
step
two
in...
in
the
retroactivity
analysis
and
ask
sort
of
the
justice
story
questions
which
in
this
case
i
guess
would
be
the
question
whether
the
act
imposes
a
disability
with
respect
to
completed
acts
as
of
the
date
of
its
enactment.
and
i
take
it
in
this
case
that
would
translate
into
the
question
whether
the...
whether
the
act
in
effect
interferes
with
the...
sort
of
the...
the
fee
agreement
or
the...
the
terms
of
the
fee
that
had
been
set
before
the
date
of
the
act.
now,
my...
my
question
i
guess
is
this.
is
it...
is
it
your
argument
that
the...
as
it
were,
the
expectations
for
payment
of
fee,
the
fee
arrangement,
was
simply
a
fee
which
in
the
terms
of
1988
was
a
reasonable
fee,
whatever
that
might
turn
out
to
be,
so
that
if
the
statute
comes
along
at
a
later
time
and
says,
well,
we
think
reasonable
is
this
lesser
amount,
the
statute
applies?
unknown
speaker
or...
that's...
that's
your
position.
unknown
speaker
why
shouldn't...
why
shouldn't
the...
the
analysis
be
that
we're
talking
about
the
real
world
here
and
the...
the
fee
arrangement
was
the
fee
arrangement
which
the...
which
the
lawyers
and
the
court
had
at
the
time
they
began
their
work?
and
at
the
time
they
began
their
work,
and
certainly
at
all...
at
the
time
that
they
did
the
work
up
until
at
least
the
effective
date...
forget
the
later
period...
their...
their
expectation
was
that
they
would
be
paid
on
whatever
the...
sort
of
the
going
rate
was
at
that
time,
which
was
the
higher
amount.
why
isn't
the
proper
analysis...
the
kind
of
real
world
factual
analysis
that
the...
that
the
terms
were
that
they
would
be
paid
at
that
higher
amount?
if
you
impose
the...
the
act
with
respect
certainly
to...
to
work
done
prior
to
the
date
of
the
act,
you
are
imposing
a
disability.
you
are
interfering
with
that
kind
of
fee
arrangement.
and
therefore,
it's
retrospective.
why
isn't
that
the
proper
analysis?
unknown
speaker
well,
why
don't
they?
unknown
speaker
i
mean,
why...
that's...
i
know
that's
your
position,
but
why...
why
don't
they?
at
the
time
they...
they
did
this
work,
there
was
no
reason
to
suppose
that
the...
that
the
practice
of
the
court
was
going
to
be,
in
effect,
interfered
with.
unknown
speaker
have...
have
any
of
those
changes
been
retrospective
in
the
sense
of
applying
to
work
previously
done
before
the
change
was
announced?
unknown
speaker
so,
in
effect,
every...
every
award
of
fees
is
for
work
previously
done.
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
did...
did
they
argue
about
the
amount
of
the
work
they've
done
and
whether
they
have
earned
the
fee,
or
did
they
argue
about
the...
the
terms
upon
which
they
will
be
compensated
for
work
done
once
the
amount
of
work
is
determined?
what's...
what's
the...
what
is
the...
the
contest
at
the
time
they
submit
the
bill,
about
the
one
point
or
the
other?
unknown
speaker
has
that
happened--
--okay.
--all...
all
along?
have...
have
they
asked
for
years...
periodically
they
ask
for
more--
unknown
speaker
--in
hourly
rate?
and
then
the
court
decides
whether
to
increase
it
or
not?
unknown
speaker
but
that
hasn't--
--yes,
but--
--go
ahead.
no,
please.
there--
--it
seems
to
me
beside
the
point
that
you
can
always
increase
the
rate.
a
windfall
is
lovely,
but
can
you
decrease
the
rate
if
there
is
an
understanding
that
there
is
at
least
a...
a
floor,
and
if
you...
can
you
decrease
that
rate?
do
you
have
any
instances
of
past
practice
in
which
the
court
has
said,
well,
i've
been
approving
rates
at...
at
100
dollars
an
hour,
but
i
think
i'll
drop
down
to
80
dollars
with
respect
to
the...
to
the
work
you've
previously
done?
i
think
it
was
just
too
high.
any
instances
of
that?
unknown
speaker
well,
then
why--
unknown
speaker
--isn't
the
actual
expectation
that...
that
we
should
bear
in
mind
when
we're
doing
a
retroactivity
analysis,
the
expectation
that,
in
fact,
there...
there
was
at
least
a
floor?
they
may
or
may
not
succeed
in
getting
it
raised,
but
there
was
at
least
a
floor
and
that
floor
is
the...
sort
of
the
benchmark
that
we
should
consider
for
retroactivity
analysis.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
know
that's
your
position,
but
why?
i
mean,
what
reason
do
you
have
for
me
to
accept
your
position?
mr.
casey,
can
the...
can
the
district
court
disappoint
the
expectations
of
the
defendants?
unknown
speaker
by...
and
every
time
it
increases
the
fees
beyond
the
fees
that
it
gave
the
last
time
around,
i
suppose
it
is
disappointing
the
expectations
of
the
defendants,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
and
that's
perfectly
okay.
unknown
speaker
well,
maybe
on
your
analysis--
--presumably
it
could...
it
could
disappoint
the
expectations
of
the
plaintiffs
as
well
should
it
decide
at
some
time
that
it
has
been
giving
too
much
money
in
the
past.
unknown
speaker
have
you
ever
objected
to
an
increase
in
the
fees?
unknown
speaker
yes.
so,
i...
i
assume
you
didn't
think
that
was
proper.
unknown
speaker
and
by
a
parity
of
reasoning,
i
suppose
it
would
not
be
proper
to...
to
decrease
retroactively.
unknown
speaker
well,
isn't
that...
is
my
logic
correct?
unknown
speaker
well,
why?
unknown
speaker
well,
so
you're...
you're
saying
that
the
only
arrangement...
that
the
only
expectation
ever
expressed
was
whatever
the
market
rate
is
you'll
get.
unknown
speaker
if
it
goes
up,
you
get
it.
if
it
goes
down--
unknown
speaker
--yours
goes
down.
unknown
speaker
now,
what
about...
and
i'm
not
sure
that
this
really
is
to
the
point,
but
i
want
to
explore
it.
what
about
the
feature
in
this
case,
as
i
understand
it,
that
at
least
after
the
judgment
for
the
period
in
which
counsel
was...
was
policing
the
judgment,
acting
as
monitor,
and
so
on,
that
the
court
actually
set
fees
in
terms
of
specific
figures.
didn't...
wasn't
there
an
order
in
one
or
the
other
of
these
cases
or
perhaps
both
saying
you
will
get
paid
at
such
and
such
an
hour
for
this
prospective
work?
unknown
speaker
okay.
for
the
future?
unknown
speaker
which
was
past.
unknown
speaker
so
that
it
was
never
forward
looking.
unknown
speaker
now,
let
me
go
back
to
my
question
and
i
won't...
i
won't
occupy
your
whole
argument.
i
just
want
to
go
through
one...
one
time
on
this.
you
say
they
cannot
look
backwards
and
say
the
reasonable
fee
is
less
than
we
have
been
paying.
and
as
i
understand
it,
you're
saying
they
can't
do
that
because
the
actual
understanding
between
court
and
counsel
was
simply
a
general
understanding.
you
get
what's
reasonable--
unknown
speaker
--not
any
specific
amount.
unknown
speaker
okay.
what
is
the
basis
for
your
saying
that?
was
that...
was
that
proposition
that
you
are
putting
forward
ever
set
forward
on
the
record?
is
it
in
writing
anywhere?
how
do
we
know
that
that
was
the
arrangement?
unknown
speaker
are...
are
you
saying
that
in
light
of
the
statute,
amounts
previously
awarded
are
now
known
to
be
unreasonable?
unknown
speaker
or
put
it
another
way,
would
it
be
unreasonable
to
award
more
than
the
statutory
amount?
assuming
no
retroactivity,
we
know
that
there's
a
policy
in
the
congress
to
put
this
cap
on.
does
that
mean
anything
above
that
is
unreasonable--
unknown
speaker
--but
isn't
there
a
range
of
reasonableness?
unknown
speaker
i
would
have
thought...
i
would
have
thought
that
you'd
look
at
when
the
work
was
performed.
and
one
line
you
could
draw
with
this
statute
that
wouldn't
pose
a
retroactivity
problem,
i
assume,
would
be
to
say
that
work
performed
by
the
lawyer
after
the
effective
date
is
governed
by
the
provisions
of
the
plra.
but
you
don't
take
that
position.
unknown
speaker
i
thought
you
said
it
turned
on
the
date
of
the
award,
regardless
of
when
the
work
was
performed.
unknown
speaker
that's
what
i
heard
you
to
say.
which
is
the
line
you're
drawing?
unknown
speaker
well--
unknown
speaker
--yes,
but
what
i'm
saying
to
you
is
i
would
think
a
line
could
be
drawn
saying
it
depends
on
when
the
work
was
performed,
and
if
it
was
performed
after
the
effective
date,
the
statute
applies.
but
you
do
not
take
that
view.
unknown
speaker
that's
your
view,
yes.
unknown
speaker
and
i
think
one
could
make
an
argument
for
a
different
approach.
unknown
speaker
let
me
ask
you
one
more
thing.
do
you
think
that
an
attorney
who
is
involved
in
the
monitoring
would
have
the
right
to
withdraw,
go
to
the
court
and
say,
i'd
like
to
withdraw
because
i
don't
want
to
work
for
the
amount
provided
in
this
statute?
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
that's
possible
to
do.
unknown
speaker
excuse
me.
they...
they
would
need
the
court's
permission.
are
they
designated
by
the
court
or
they
just
happen
to
be
the
attorneys
for...
for
the
client
and
they...
they
need
to
get
the
court's
permission
to
cease
being
attorneys
for
the
client?
unknown
speaker
they
would...
do
they
have
court
appointments?
because
i
assume--
unknown
speaker
--they
did
not
have
court
appointments.
unknown
speaker
very
well,
mr.
casey.
ms.
labelle,
we'll
hear
from
you.
unknown
speaker
the
date
of
the
enactment
or
the
effective
date
of
the
act?
unknown
speaker
the
fees
have
been
paid,
contrary
to
what
counsel
has
just
told
us.
unknown
speaker
so,
in
your
view,
the
only
thing
at
issue
is
fees
earned,
if
you
will,
after
the
effective
date
of
plra?
unknown
speaker
did
they
pay
them
because
the
district
court
required
them
to?
i
mean,
they
did
contest
them
all,
didn't
they?
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
it
was
not
a
voluntary
payment
and
then
they
sought
to
get
it
back.
unknown
speaker
they
didn't
pay
until
ordered
to
do
so
by
the
court.
unknown
speaker
excuse
me.
that
means
then
that...
that
really
question
1
in
the
questions
presented
is
not
really
before
us.
is
that...
yes.
i'm
sorry.
no.
question
1
is
not
before
us.
unknown
speaker
wait
a
minute.
oh,
it's
question--
--but
they--
--question
2
that's
not
before
us.
unknown
speaker
they
have
paid
them,
but
are
they
still
able
to
contest
them
procedurally?
unknown
speaker
didn't
they
challenge
that
in
the
sixth
circuit?
unknown
speaker
why
did
the
subsequent
opinion
address
it
if
it
had
been
paid
under
the
earlier
opinion?
unknown
speaker
ms.
labelle,
let
me
get
at
least
myself
straight.
maybe
my
colleagues
are
already
straight.
question
2
is
whether
in
such
litigation
this
fee
provision
applies
to
fees
awarded
after
the
act's
effective
date
for
services
rendered
before
that
date.
now,
do
you
say
that
that
question
is
not
before
us?
unknown
speaker
and
why
is
that?
unknown
speaker
so...
go
ahead.
i
just...
does
the
record
show
that
they
were
paid?
unknown
speaker
why
did
they
not
seek
to
pursue
that
matter
if
it's
included
in
the
questions
presented?
or
it's
not
in
the
cert
petition?
unknown
speaker
it's
our
fault.
you're
blaming
it
on
us.
[laughter]
yes,
it
was
framed
much
more
generally
in
the
question
presented.
it
would
have
embraced
both,
though,
whether
the
attorney
fee
provision
applies
to
fees
for
services
in
litigation
pending
on
the
effective
date
of
the
plra.
that
would
include
both,
but
it
didn't
split
them
out.
unknown
speaker
let
me
just
be
sure
i
get...
you
do
tell
me
this
in
the
record,
the
fact
that
they
were
paid
before.
unknown
speaker
i
see.
well,
is
it
in
the
record
of--
--well,
because
he
has
a
different
memory.
i
was...
is
it
in
the
record
of
a
michigan
court,
whether
it
got--
unknown
speaker
--into
the
portion
you
sent
to
us?
unknown
speaker
so,
your...
your
position
then
is...
is
you
reject
all
of
the
previous
positions
that
have
either
been
suggested
from
the
bench
or
by...
by
your
opponent.
it
applies
only
to
a
lawsuit
that
is
brought
after
the
act.
unknown
speaker
well,
we
didn't
say
that
in
landgraf.
i
mean,
it
depends
on
what
the
rule
is.
i
mean,
if...
if
congress
changes,
for
example,
a
rule
of
evidence,
as
to
the
admissibility
of
evidence,
i
didn't
understand
landgraf
to
say
that
we
would
treat
that
as
inapplicable
to
cases
filed
before
the
rule
of
evidence
was
adopted.
unknown
speaker
but
this
is
procedural
a
fortiori.
it's
really
tertiary
conduct
that
we're
talking
about
here.
you
don't
need
to
look
at
the
clock
either.
we're
looking
at
presumably
actions
taken
by
michigan
correctional
authorities
some
time
ago
dealing
with
prisoners.
that
would
be
the
primary
conduct.
now,
here
we
get
to
something.
we're
talking
about
the
rate
at
which
attorneys
for
the
prevailing
party
which
prevailed
somewhere
back
in
the
'70's
are
to
be
paid
in
the
'90's.
unknown
speaker
well,
only
if
you
win.
i
mean,
this...
this
was
crap
shoot
anyway.
you...
you
didn't
know
you
were
going
to
get
any
attorney's
fees
whatever,
much
less
were
you
guaranteed
the
absolute
amount
of
them.
you
knew
you
would
get
attorney's
fees
if
you
won.
unknown
speaker
but
it's
a
good
deal
less
certain
than
the
kind
of
reliances
that...
that
we
typically
say
cannot
be
upset
by
future
legislation.
i
mean,
there's
all
sorts
of
reliance.
i
mean,
the
person
who...
who
builds
a
nuclear
plant
may
rely
on
the
existing
state
of
the
law
and
make
substantial
investments
on
the
basis
of
it,
but
the
law
changes
and
he's
just...
he's
just
out
his
investment.
why
isn't
this
that
kind
of
reliance?
there
was
no
guarantee
you
were
going
to
get
attorney's
fees
at
all,
much
less
the
fixed
amount
of
them.
unknown
speaker
the
court
can
bind
congress
that
way
for
the
future?
i
would
think
at
least
as
soon
as
congress
says
we
repudiate
that
court's
pronouncement
for
the
future,
congress
wins
rather
than
the
court.
unknown
speaker
the
reason
they
did
it
in
802,
as
i
suggested
earlier,
was...
was
that
802...
they
had
to
say
it
because
they...
they
said
whether
the
relief
was
originally
granted
before
the
date
of
enactment.
there's
no
contention
here
that
we're
going
to
go
back
before
the
date
of
enactment.
unknown
speaker
and
he
just
says
all
orders
entered
after
the
date
of
enactment.
now,
had
they
wanted
in
this
case
to
cover
even
attorney's
fees
orders
entered
before
the
date
of
enactment,
then
they
would
have
had
to
have
something
like
what
was
said
in
802.
but...
but
that
wasn't
what...
what
they
wanted
here
according
to
the
other
side.
unknown
speaker
but
you're
saying
they
cannot
do
that.
you're
saying
that
even
as
to
future
rates
set
after
a
hearing
for
the
purpose
of
determining
future
rates.
as
i
understand
your
argument,
you're
saying
in
this
case
the
rate
as
determined
by
the
statute
may
not,
in
fact,
be
applied.
unknown
speaker
the
statute...
yes.
well,
why...
why
could
not
the
statute
be
given
effect
as
of
its
effective
date
to
work
performed
after
that
date?
because
after
that
date,
counsel
must
know,
of
course,
that
the
statute
was
enacted
and
that
it
might
well
apply.
unknown
speaker
but
it's
a
very
simple
line
to
draw
and
certainly
could
be
i
think
on
the
face
of
the
statute.
in
fact,
that's
the
most
common
sense
reading
of
it
i
would
think.
unknown
speaker
it
was
the
line
the
district
court
drew,
though,
wasn't
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
how...
how
is
it
retroactive
if
you
say
it
applies
to
work
performed
after
the
effective
date?
how
is
that
retroactive?
unknown
speaker
well,
how
could...
how
could
attorney's
fees
at
an
hourly
rate
be
applied
on
any
basis
other
than
work
performed?
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
we're
over
the
point
of
getting
paid
for
the
litigation,
and
we're
talking
i
think
only
about
these
endless
monitoring
arrangements,
these
open-ended,
ongoing
monitoring
arrangements.
isn't
that
what
we're
talking
about
here?
unknown
speaker
if
you
have
a
trial
court
that
said,
you
know,
counsel,
we've
been
working
with
this
case
for
2
or
3
years.
i've
been
making
attorney
fee
awards.
i
want
to
tell
you
that
henceforth,
i'm
going
to
put
a
cap
on
the
fees
of
x
dollars
an
hour,
which
is
lower.
you're
telling
us
that
that
is
retroactive.
that's
a
very
strange
way
to
use
the
term
retroactive.
unknown
speaker
well,
except
the
attorney
never
had
the
expectation
that
he
would
get
anything
more
than
a
reasonable
fee.
unknown
speaker
well--
--well,
i
suppose
by
a
miracle
that
they...
which
i
think
they
should
do...
that
they
increase
or
double
the
rate
that's
paid
to
counsel
in
criminal
cases,
then
what
would
you
be
saying?
would
you
be
saying
that
doesn't
apply
to
us?
in
other
words,
instead
of
the
75
dollars
an
hour
max,
which
is
awfully
low...
i
think
far
too
low...
they
said,
very
well,
it
will
be
150
dollars.
and
then
your
fees
would
go
way
up
and
would
you
be
in
here
saying,
no,
no,
no,
that
doesn't
apply?
it's
all--
unknown
speaker
--yes,
yes,
but
i
mean,
your
point...
the
issue,
i
would
have
thought,
was
not
retroactivity.
i
don't
see
this
retroactivity
jurisprudence
as
relevant
either.
it's
just
an
issue
of
whether
or
not
the
statute
applies
to
future
work
in
pending
cases.
unknown
speaker
and
normally
you'd
think
it
does
apply
to
future
work
in
pending
cases,
but...
but
you
produce
some
reasons
why
not,
and
that's
what
i
want
to
hear.
unknown
speaker
i
don't
think
you'd
be
making
this
as
a
set
deal...
years
ago
we
decided
initially
what
all
the
future
rates
would
be...
if
tomorrow
they
come
along
and
they
double
the...
the
base
rate
for
the...
for
the
defendant.
that's
my
point.
i'm
trying
to
focus
you
on
reasons.
what
are
your
reasons
why
you
say,
gee,
this
seems
awfully...
if
it
favors
you,
it
does;
if
it
doesn't...
that
isn't
going
to
be
a
reason.
unknown
speaker
but
you're...
you're
not
just...
you're
talking
again
about
secondary
or
tertiary
conduct.
landgraf
was
dealing
with
primary
conduct:
what
is
the
basis
for
liability?
we're
not
talking
about
liability
in
the
lawsuit
at
all
here.
we're
talking
about
compensation
of
attorneys.
unknown
speaker
but
that's
not
involved
here.
unknown
speaker
well,
if
you
drew
the
line
at
the
mechanics
of
awarding,
i
can
understand
your
concern.
if
you
drew
the
line
at
when
the
work
is
performed,
that's
a
different
question
it
seems
to
me.
and
i...
is
there
any
reason
why
a
lawyer
who
is
governed
by
the
act
in
a
situation
where
the
lawyer
is
providing
monitoring
services...
is
there
any
reason
why
the
lawyer
couldn't
withdraw
if
the
lawyer
thought,
well,
this
is
just
not
enough
for
me?
unknown
speaker
ms.
labelle,
didn't
judge
wald
bring
up
some
ethical
constraints
that
might
operate
on
a
lawyer
in
that
situation?
she
apparently
didn't
think
that
the
lawyer
could
just
walk
away
from
this
kind
of
undertaking.
unknown
speaker
it
may
be
a
good
reason
to
stop
monitoring
if...
if
the
rates
are
such
that
you
can't
get
competent
counsel
to
do
it.
maybe
the
district
court
should
take
another
look
at
that.
unknown
speaker
when...
when
was
that,
ms.
labelle?
unknown
speaker
ms.--
--that
was
the
glover
case?
unknown
speaker
and
that
was
the
one
from
19...
that
started
in
1977?
unknown
speaker
ms.--
--go
ahead.
i'm
sorry.
ms.
labelle,
is
it...
is
it
the
expectations
of
the
lawyers
we
ought
to
be
looking
at
in
this
case
anyway?
these...
these
fees
are
not
really
awarded
to
the
lawyers,
are
they?
unknown
speaker
right,
and...
and
in
what
respect
was
the
expectation
of
the
client
disappointed?
unknown
speaker
the
party
is
going
to
turn
over
whatever
attorney's
fees
the
party
gets
to
the
lawyers
is
what's
going
to
happen.
i
don't
think
the
party
really...
really
cares
whether
the
party
turns
over
more
or
less.
i
understood
the...
the
purpose
of
this
provision
to
be
to
help
parties,
not
to...
not
to
help
lawyers.
unknown
speaker
how
frequent
is
it
in
these
prison
reform
litigation
cases
that...
that
there
is
any
significant
monetary
award
to
the
plaintiffs?
unknown
speaker
those
cases
would
tend
to
be
brought
not
as
these
large
class
actions,
would
they?
the
wrongful
death
case?
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
you
to
clarify
one
point
to
make
sure
i
got
it
right?
did
you
respond,
in
answer
to
justice
breyer's
question,
that
you
would
take
the
same
line
with
respect
to
a
congress
that
doubled
the
fee,
because
it
wanted
to
give
people
incentive
to
bring
these
actions,
that
the
word
brought
would
mean
that
the
increase
applied
only
to
actions
brought
after
the
effective
date?
unknown
speaker
so,
the
answer
is
yes.
it
would
have
the
same--
unknown
speaker
--words,
the
same
history.
unknown
speaker
it
would
work
both
ways.
unknown
speaker
well,
may
i
raise
a
question
here?
i
have
one
basically
simple
problem
with
your
statutory
argument,
to
the
extent
that
you
are
arguing
that
at
no
time
may
the
court
prospectively
change
the
rate
in
this
case
to
conform
to
the
new...
to
the
new
act.
the
problem
that
i
have
with
it
is
that
i
assume...
i
have
to
assume...
that
congress
legislated
against
a
background
of...
of
fee
award
practices
in...
in
which
we...
we
all
find
it
a
familiar
feature
of
the
system,
that
the
court
is
constantly
reexamining
fee
orders
in...
in
these
continuing
cases.
lawyers
come
in,
just
as
i
guess...
i
don't
know
whether
you
did,
but
i
gather
a
lawyer
did
in
this
case
and
said
i
ought
to
paid
more,
and
that
was
even
for
work
that
had
been
completed.
but
in
any
case,
i
ought
to
get
a
higher
rate.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
the...
that
the
background
principle
against
which
congress
probably
legislated
was
the
principle
in
which
adjustments
are
made
as
we
go
along.
now,
we
may
fight
about
the
retroactive
effect
of
making
that
adjustment
with
respect
to
a
post-enactment
period
for
work
done
before
the
adjustment
is
made.
let's
leave
that
aside.
but
with
respect
to
an
adjustment
which
is
by
any
standard
totally
prospective,
the
adjustment
that
is
made
when
the
court
says,
from
now
on
any
work
that
you
do
is
going
to
be
compensated
at
the...
at
the
rate
under
the
new
statute,
it
seems
to
me
that
that
is
probably
in
conformance
with
what
congress
would
have
assumed
as
a
background
principle
for
the
way
fee
awards
in
continuing
cases
are
made.
now,
is...
is
my
simple
problem
subject
to
a
simple
answer?
unknown
speaker
which
is
what
we
have
here.
unknown
speaker
well,
what...
may
i
question
that?
how
many...
this
is
really
a
question.
it's
not
just
a
rhetorical
question.
how
many
lawyers
begin
cases...
let's
say,
prison
litigation
cases...
with
a...
a
clear
understanding
about
what
the
hourly
rate
is
going
to
be
if
they
win?
is
that...
is
that
commonly
done?
do
we
go
into
court
and
pretrials
in
these
cases
and
say,
if
you're
the
prevailing
party,
you're
going
to
get
x
dollars
an
hour?
unknown
speaker
do
they
say
that
at
pretrials,
or
is
that
again
just
kind
of
a
background
principle
upon
which
everybody
behaves?
unknown
speaker
but
is
the
prevailing
rate
understood
as
the
prevailing
rate
for
fee
awards
in
the
federal
courts
for
assigned
counsel
cases
or
the
prevailing
rate
in
the
bar
in
general?
i
assume
the
former,
but
maybe
i'm
wrong.
unknown
speaker
is
that
so?
thank
you,
ms.
labelle.
unknown
speaker
mr.
casey,
you
have
4
minutes
remaining.
mr.
casey,
would
you
clarify
a
factual
matter
for
me?
i
had
thought
that
you
had
said
that
all
of
the
awards
here
were
retrospective;
that
is,
you
came
in
after
6
months
of
work,
and
at
that
point
the
court
would
tell
you
what
rate
you
would
get
for
the
6
months
preceding.
but
i
understood
ms.
labelle
to
say
the
opposite,
that
the
court
was...
was
saying
for
the
next
6
months,
you're
going
to
get
such
and
such
a
rate.
unknown
speaker
and
the
order
does
not
say,
moreover,
this
rate
will
continue
for
the
next
6
months.
unknown
speaker
is
there
any
indication
here
that
congress
focused
specifically
on
what
i'd
call
prison
litigation,
long,
ongoing
cases,
20-year
cases,
15-year
cases,
as
compared
to
just
an
ordinary
case
where
a
prisoner
says
i'm
being
held
under
bad
conditions,
one
person,
one
time,
et
cetera?
unknown
speaker
do
you
have
any
empirical
data
on...
on
how
many
old
cases
there
are
hanging
around
forever
as
compared
to
the
number
of
new
that
are
brought
from
year
to
year?
unknown
speaker
no
is
the
answer.
unknown
speaker
is
it
correct
that
the
theory
on
which
the
cases
go
on
so
long
is
that
the
plaintiffs
contend...
maybe
their
wrong...
that
the
violations
of
the
constitution
have
not
been
terminated?
unknown
speaker
and
the
district
court
must
find
that
to
be
true
in
order
not
to
terminate
the
litigation.
unknown
speaker
general
casey,
could
i
clarify
one
more
factual
matter?
am
i
correct
that
none
of
the
fees
involved
in
this
case
involve
the
fees
incurred
in
litigating
the
initial...
to
the
initial
judgment?
unknown
speaker
they
are
all
later--
unknown
speaker
--monitoring
fees.
unknown
speaker
and
may
i
ask
with
respect
to
my
previous
question
that
if...
if
ms.
labelle
is
of
a
different
view,
namely,
is
of
the
view
that
these
judicial
orders
were
prospective
and
said
that
you're
entitled
to
so
much
of
a
rate
for
the
future,
that
perhaps
she...
or
where
that...
where
that
would...
would
appear
in
the
record.
this
is
an
important
fact
for
me
and
i
think
the
two
of
you
have
said
different
things.
and...
and--
unknown
speaker
--but
they're
all
in
the
same--
unknown
speaker
--how
much
has
the
state
paid
in...
in
the
glover
case
to
date?
everything.
