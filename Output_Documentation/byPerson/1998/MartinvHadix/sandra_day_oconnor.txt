justice
sandra
day
o'connor
this
is
no.
98-262,
martin
versus
hadix.
it
comes
to
us
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
sixth
circuit.
more
than
20
years
ago,
michigan
prison
inmates
filed
two
federal
class
action
lawsuits
against
state
prison
officials,
challenging
the
conditions
of
confinement
in
the
michigan
prison
system.
more
than
10
years
ago,
in
both
cases
the
district
court
had
concluded
that
the
plaintiffs
were
prevailing
parties
and
that
they
were
entitled
to
attorney's
fees
for
postjudgment
monitoring
of
the
state's
compliance
with
the
remedial
orders.
the
district
court
established
a
system
for
awarding
these
attorney's
fees
and
set
a
specific
market
rate
for
awarding
the
fees.
by
1996
the
market
rate
was
set
by
the
court
at
a
$150
an
hour.
on
april
26,
1996
however
congress
passed
the
prison
litigation
reform
act
which
became
effective
in
april.
the
act
as
relevant
to
this
case
limits
the
size
of
the
attorney's
fees
that
maybe
awarded
in
prison
litigation
lawsuits.
for
example,
in
this
case
the
act
caps
fee
awards
at
the
maximum
hourly
rate
of
a
$112.50.
the
district
court
concluded
that
the
plra's
fee
cap
does
not
limit
fees,
for
work
performed
before
the
effective
date
of
the
act,
but
that
it
does
limit
the
awards
for
work
performed
after
the
effective
date
of
the
act.
on
appeal
the
sixth
circuit
affirmed
in
part
and
reversed
in
part.
the
court
of
appeals
concluded
that
the
act's
fees
provision
does
not
apply
for
cases
such
as
the
cases
here
that
were
pending
when
the
act
was
enacted,
regardless
of
when
the
work
was
performed.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
of
the
court
today,
we
affirm
in
part
and
reverse
in
part.
in
determining
whether
a
new
law
like
the
prison
litigation
reform
act
applies
to
pending
cases,
we
ask
first
whether
congress
has
expressly
prescribed
the
statute's
temporal
reach,
in
other
words
what
it
is
going
to
apply
to
and
when.
in
this
case
we
conclude
that
congress
has
not
spoken
to
the
temporal
reach
of
the
fees
provision.
as
a
result
we
ask
the
next
question,
whether
application
of
the
fees
provision
to
the
case
here
would
have
a
retroactive
effect.
in
this
case
we
conclude
that
the
act's
fees
provision
would
have
a
retroactive
effect
when
applied
to
work
performed
before
the
effective
date
of
the
act.
the
attorneys
in
these
cases
had
a
reasonable
expectation
that
the
work
they
performed
before
the
enactment
of
the
prison
litigation
reform
act
would
be
compensated
at
the
rate
set
by
the
district
court.
to
apply
the
act,
the
fees
cap
the
work
performed
before
its
effective
date
would
alter
this
arrangement
post
hoc
by
reducing
that
rate
of
compensation
because
this
type
of
retroactive
effect
would
be
inconsistent
with
our
traditional
presumption
against
retroactivity,
we
decline
to
apply
the
act
retroactively
in
the
absence
of
an
expressed
directive
by
congress
to
that
effect.
by
contrast,
the
act's
fees
provision,
as
applied
to
work
performed
after
the
effective
date
of
the
act,
does
not
have
a
retroactive
effect.
there
is
no
retroactivity
problem
in
telling
a
lawyer
that
going
forward;
any
work
the
attorney
performs
will
be
at
a
lower
hourly
rate.
if
the
attorney
does
not
want
to
work
at
the
new
lower
rate
she
can
decline
the
job.
accordingly,
we
affirm
in
part
and
reverse
in
part
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals.
justice
scalia
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
the
judgment;
justice
ginsburg
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
part
and
dissenting
in
part
which
is
joined
by
justice
stevens.
