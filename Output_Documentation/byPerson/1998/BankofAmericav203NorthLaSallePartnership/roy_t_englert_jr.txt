mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
bank
of
america
lent
203
north
lasalle
street
partnership
92
million
dollars.
the
loan
was
secured
by
15
floors
of
an
office
building
in
the
loop,
in
chicago.
outside
of
bankruptcy,
the
bank
would
have
been
entitled
to
be
repaid
93
million
dollars
in
january
of
1995,
or
to
foreclose
on
the
real
estate.
in
the
bankruptcy
proceeding
that
the
court
is
reviewing
today,
the
bank
was
denied
the
right
to
foreclose.
its
right
to
receive
a
93
million
dollar
repayment
in
january
1995
was
converted
into
a
right
to
receive
60
million
dollars
worth,
present
value,
of
payments
over
a
period
extending
to
the
year
2005.
ownership
of
the
real
estate
was
left
in
the
hands
of
203
north
lasalle
street
partnership,
despite
its
default
on
the
loan,
in
exchange
for
a
promise
to
contribute
4.1
million
dollars
net
present
value
of
new
value
into
the
estate
over
5
years.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
it's
the
same
partnership.
it's
been
reconstituted
with
the
percentage
ownerships
changing.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
that's
correct,
your
honor.
some
partners
exercised
their
option;
some
did
not.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
it
is
a--
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
--it
is
the
reorganized
debtor.
it
was
not
reconstituted
as
a
separate
partnership,
but
as
a
reorganized
debtor.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
i
don't
know
the
answer
to
that
question,
your
honor.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
that's
correct,
your
honor.
certainly
the
owners
of
the
equity
are
mostly
old
equity
owners.
they
may
be
all
old
equity
owners.
i'm
just
not
sure
whether
anybody
new
came
in.
but
the
main
purpose
of
this
plan
was
to
save
the
individual
partners
from
suffering
tax
losses
on
transfer
of
ownership.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
that
would
be
a
very
different
case,
your
honor.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
that
would
be
a
very
different
case.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
it
might
well
have.
the
key
statutory
phrase,
your
honor,
is
that
the...
is
that
the
junior
interest
holders
may
not
receive
or
retain
under
the
plan,
on
account
of
such
junior
claim
or
interest,
any
property.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
it's
section
1129(b)(2)(b)(ii)
of
the
bankruptcy
code.
it's
on
page
2(a)
of
the
appendix
to
our
brief.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
the
claim
of
our
client...
of
my
client?
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
the
creditor
is
owed
93
million
dollars.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
the
trade
creditors
had
claims
of
90,000
dollars.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
correct.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
well,
i
agree
with
you,
your
honor.
but
the
seventh
circuit
certainly
thought
otherwise.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
well,
your
honor,
if
i--
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
--we...
we
can
object.
we
did
object.
the...
the
provision
that
makes
the
unsecured
creditors
important
is
section
1190...
1129(a)(10),
which
requires
the
assent
to
the
plan
of
at
least
one
impaired
class.
and
keeping
the
trade
creditors
in
the
plan
not
to
be
paid
in
full
in...
in
the
case...
not
paid
in
full...
was
important
to
the
debtor.
we
can't
take
them
out
of
the
bankruptcy
case
just--
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
--we
can...
we
can
purchase
their
claims.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
we...
the
debtor
got
to
them
first.
the
debtor
paid
them
in
full.
justice
o'connor,
in
response
to
your
question,
the
key
phrase
here
is...
is
"on
account
of".
and
if
they
had
not
been
granted
property
on
account
of
their
pre-petition
equity
interest,
this
would
be
a
vastly
different
case.
they
were
granted
two
forms
of
property
on
account
of
their
pre-petition
equity
interest.
one
was
the
exclusive
option
to
buy
equity
in
the
reorganized
debtor.
an
option
is
itself
a
property
right.
options
in
publicly
traded
stocks
are
bought
and
sold
every
day.
judge
reinhardts
opinions
in
the
ninth
circuit
in
bonner
mall,
conceded
that
the--
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
--your
honor,
every--
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
--it
did,
your
honor.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
it
did.
the
plan
doesn't
give
anybody
anything
until
a
bankruptcy
judge
confirms
it.
so,
under
the
plan,
has
to
mean
what
happens
when
this
plan
is
confirmed.
and
it
was
the
plan
that
excluded
anyone
other
than
the
pre-petition
equity
holders
from
having
the
option
to
buy
equity
in
the
reorganized
debtor.
it's
also
the
plan
that
gives
the
pre-petition
equity
holders
the
equity
interest
in
the
reorganized
debtor
on
account
of
being
pre-petition
equity
holders.
in
other
words,
on
account
of
their
prior
claim
or
interest.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
not
quite,
your
honor.
if
they're
ever
to
be
allowed
to
contribute
new
value
over
the
objections
of
a
class
of
impaired
creditors,
then
yes,
we...
our
position
is
that
the...
the
opportunity
to
buy
the
equity
for
new
value
must
be
distributed
equally.
but
the
real-world
way
that
new
value
plans
get
confirmed
all
the
time
is
through
creditor
consent.
and
that's
what
congress
intended.
it
didn't
intend
judges
to
cram
down
new
value
plans.
it
intended
negotiation
among
the
parties
to
allocate
any
going
concern
surplus.
the
legislative
history
says
that
explicitly...
page
224
of
the
house
report.
this
court--
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
--there
are
many
cram-downs,
your
honor,
in
many
kinds
of
cases.
we're
dealing
here
with
a
single
asset
real
estate
case,
where
there
are,
as
justice
breyer's
question
points
out,
essentially
two
real
parties
in
interest.
the
typical
bankruptcy
case
is
not
a
single
asset
real
estate
case.
it
has
multifaceted
parties--
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
--with
multifaceted
interests,
and
cram-down
is
often
necessary.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
you
don't
reach
1129(b)
unless
there
is
an
objection
by
a
class
of
creditors--
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
--that's
also
correct,
your
honor,
yes.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
but
the
absolute
priority
rule
says
that
you
go
in
absolute
priority,
that
you
see
if
the
people
who
are
not
being
paid
in
full
are
more
senior
than
junior
people
who
are
receiving
or
retaining
property.
and
if
they
are,
the
plan
violates
the
absolute
priority
rule.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
because,
otherwise,
the
equity
owners
are
receiving
something
on
account
of
their
junior
claim
or
interest.
which
is
exactly
what
1129(b)(2)(b)(ii)
prohibits.
now,
it's
our
position
that
the
statutory
language
is
dispositive
here.
but
the
legislative
history
is
also
legislative
history
is
also
extremely
helpful
to
the
bank.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
absolutely
not,
your
honor.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
in
a
typical
bankruptcy
case,
especially
involving
a
small
business,
the
debtors'
pre-petition
equity
holders
will
often
have
lent
money
to
the
business
in
the
form
of
debt
and
not
equity.
if
we
excise
the
phrase
"on
account
of"
from
the
statute,
those
people
could
not
receive
or
retain
anything
on
account
of
their
debt,
as
well
as
being
unable
to
receive
anything
on
account
of
their...
on
account
of
their
equity
interest.
that
would
be
a
radically
different
world
than
the
world
we
have
under
section
1129(b)(2)(b)(ii).
in
addition,
as
justice
o'connor--
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
--yes.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
no,
it
would
not,
your
honor.
that
raises
the...
the
questions
of
bidding
for
the
equity.
if
the
words
"on
account
of"
were
deleted,
the
debtor
could
not
bid
against
the
bank
for
the
equity.
because
the
words
"on
account
of"
are
in
there,
if
someone
wanted
to
hold
an
open
auction
for
the
equity
in
which
the...
the
debtor
bid,
or
the
debtor's
pre-petition
equity
holders
bid,
and
the
bank
bid
as
well,
then
whoever
won
that
auction
would
be
receiving
the
equity
on
account
of
having
the
highest
bid
and
not
on
account
of
the
pre-petition
equity
interest.
that's
why
the
words
"on
account
of"
have
a
role
to
play
in
addition
to
their
role
of
allowing
people
to
be
paid
on
their
debt
claim.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
well,
here
there
was
a
one-horse
bid,
a
one-horse...
a
one--
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
--oh,
no,
he
would
have
approved
the
plan.
because
we
were
prepared
to
say
we'll
put
in
more
money,
and
he
approved
the
plan
anyway.
he
said,
i'm
not
terminating
exclusivity.
you
can't
do
that.
i'm
going
with
the
debtor's
plan.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
the
bank
wouldn't
always
have
the
stronger
horse,
but
the
bank
would
always
be
in
the
race.
because
there
is
a
point
at
which
they
could
outbid
us,
on
the
facts
of
this
case.
there
comes
a
point
at
which
they
could
outbid
us
for
the
equity
in
this
property.
it's
in
our
best
interest
to
maximize
the
value
of
the
estate.
and
if
their
bid
for
the
new
equity
is
so
high
that
we
think
we're
really
going
to
get
more
money
out
of
their
plan
than
out
of
foreclosure,
then
they
can
win
the
auction
with
our
blessing.
but
we
think
this
property
is
worth
a
lot
more
than
what
we're
going
to
get
under
this
confirmed
plan.
and
up
to
the
point
where
they
have
satisfied
us
that
they're
going
to
make
us
better
off,
we
will
continue
to
outbid
them,
bidding
our
deficiency
claim...
or
bidding
cash,
because
we
get
it
back
on
a
deficiency
claim...
so
that...
so
that
we
can
win
the
auction.
and...
and
in
many
cases,
if
banks...
if
senior
unsecured
creditors,
or
senior
secured
creditors
with
unsecured
deficiency
claims,
are
allowed
to
bid,
that's
how
the
auction
will
work.
now...
now,
let
me
add,
to
the
best
of
my
knowledge,
no
debtor
and
no
creditor
has
ever
proposed
an
auction
as
the
way
to
get
around
section
1129(b)(2)(b)(ii).
only
bankruptcy
judges
have
ever
proposed
that
as
a
creative
solution.
debtors
don't
like
it
because
they
want
exclusivity.
exclusivity
matters
a
very
great
deal
to
them,
to
be
able
to
keep
the
property.
and
creditors
don't
like
it
because
they
don't
want
to
go
through
the
nonsense
of
an
auction.
they
just
want
to
have
the
absolute
priority
rule
applied
as
it's
written.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
that--
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
--that
would
clearly
violate
the
statute.
no
question
it
would
violate
the
statute.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
because
they
are
receiving
something...
the
right
to
the
50
percent
equity
interest...
on
account
of
their
junior
claims
of
interest.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
no,
but--
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
--the
statute
doesn't
ask
whether
we
get
anything
on
account
of
our
junior
claim
or
interest
because
we're
the
objecting
impaired
class.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
it's...
it's
not
just
because
of
their
position.
but
it's
because
of
their
position.
it's
on
account
of
their
position.
and
that's
the
question
the
statute
asks.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
i
agree,
justice
scalia.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
i
agree.
and
that
would
delight
the
bank,
because
that's
the
way
we're
going
to
maximize
the
value
of
the
estate,
which
is
what
we
want.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
under
our
view
of
the
case,
it
is
never
possible
for
him
to
say
for
that
reason,
i'm
going
to
choose
to
allow
the
equity
holders
to
retain
the
equity
without
some
sort
of
competitive
bidding.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
sure.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
that's
a
clear
violation
of
the
statutory
language.
because,
at
that
point,
there's
absolutely
no
secret
what's
going
on.
he
is
trying
to
favor
the
prior
equity
holders
as
such.
he
is
trying
to--
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
--no.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
he
cannot
do
that
because
he
is
still
giving
equity
a
preferred
position.
he
is
not
excluding
equity
from
the
auction,
whereas
he
is
excluding
the
debtor...
the
creditor,
excuse
me...
from
the
auction.
and
he
is
still
giving
the
junior
interest
holders
something
on
account
of
their
claim.
but
let
me
add,
justice
breyer,
in
response
to
your...
to
your
question,
that's
a
very
unworldly
scenario
for
this
reason.
a
bank
that
thinks
there
is
more
money
to
be
gained
for
its
claim
by
letting
someone
else
come
in
and
bid
on
the
equity,
but
nevertheless
can
insist
on
its
pound
of
flesh
and
says,
we're
going
to
sell
this
for
scrap,
is
acting
irrational.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
we
asked
for
permission
to
put
in
a
completing...
a
competing
plan.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
we
did
tender
a
competing
plan,
but
it
was
not...
we
were
not
allowed
to
file
it
because
of
the
statutory
exclusivity
of
1121(c).
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
i
have
forgotten
the
facts
of
the
alternate
plan
in
the
coltex
case.
but
our
plan
in
this
case
was
a
plan
of
liquidation.
because
that
is
how
we
believe
that
the
estate...
the
value
of
this
estate
will
be
maximized.
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
there
are
two
forms
of
property
that
were
received
or
retained
under
the
plan
on
account
of
the
junior
interest,
in
violation
of
the
statute.
one
is
the
option.
the
second
is
the
equity.
mr.
bendix
says
we
do
not
contend
that
the
equity
was
received
on
account
of
the
prior
junior
interest.
that's
flatly
wrong.
we
do
contend
that
both
forms
of
property
were
so
received.
this
is
the
second
time
the
court
has
construed
1129(b)(2)(b)(ii).
the
first
time,
the
debtor's
counsel
stood
at
the
lectern
in
this
court
and
said
the
creditors
are
getting
a
windfall
because
we're
putting
in
new
value.
this
court's
response,
in
a
unanimous
opinion,
was:
the
court
of
appeals
may
well
have
believed
that
petitioners
or
other
unsecured
creditors
would
be
better
off
if
respondent's
reorganization
plan
was
confirmed.
but
that
determination
is
for
the
creditors
to
make
in
the
manner
specified
by
the
code.
mr.

u.s.,
at

mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
your
honor,
i
do
suggest
that
the
court
meant
that
literally.
and
i
do
suggest
that
that's
what
the
legislative
history
and
text
of
the
code
both
say.
in...
in
reference
to
the
legislative
history,
let
me
say,
mr.
bendix
relies
heavily
on
pre-code
practice.
the
legislative
history,
at
page
414
of
the
house
report,
says:
the
elements
of
the
test
are
new,
departing
from
both
the
absolute
priority
rule
and
the
best
interest
of
creditors
test
found
under
the
bankruptcy
act.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
no,
absolutely
not,
your
honor.
h.r.
8200
was
passed
by
the
house.
its
language
was
taken
into
the
code
that
was
enacted,
in
preference
to
the
senate
report.
and
the
debtor
says,
look
at
what
the
conferees
said.
let
me
tell
you
what
the
conferees
said.
i'm
quoting:
except
to
the
extent
of
the
treatment
of
secured
claims
under
subparagraph
(a)
of
this
statement,
the
house
report
remains
an
accurate
description
of
confirmation
of
section
1129.
that's
from
124
congressional
record,
32,408,
and
34,007.
it's
quoted
in
footnote
23
of
the
solicitor
general's
brief.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
justice
scalia,
legislative
history
always
could
be
wrong.
[laughter]
but
the
legislative
history
is
very
one-sided
in
this
case.
"in
exchange
for"
cannot
possibly
be
the
meaning
of
"on
account
of".
section
1123(a)(5)(j)
of
the
bankruptcy
code
uses
"in
exchange
for"
and
not
"on
account
of".
and
you
cannot
receive
or
retain
property
in
exchange
for
something.
the
fact
that
"on
account
of"
is
used
repeatedly
in
connection
with
the
phrase
"receive
or
retain"
shows
that
it
must
have
a
broader
meaning
than
"in
exchange
for".
and,
indeed,
if...
if
mr.
bendix's
argument
about
"in
exchange
for"
were
correct,
ours
was
wrongly
decided.
it's
holding
and
not
just
every
literal
word
of
it,
justice
stevens.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
there
was
no
cash.
that
was
a--
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
--i'm
sorry,
there
was...
there
was
an
exchange.
there
was
sweat
equity.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
that's
correct.
but
the...
the
sweat
equity
was
treated
as
having
economic
value.
the...
justice
scalia,
there
is--
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
--correct.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
he
said
the
other
with
respect
to
cash
under
the
1898
bankruptcy
act,
yes.
thank
you.
