ms.
petitioner
patricia
a
millett
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
because
respondents
concede
that
they
received
property
under
this
reorganization
plan,
the
only
question
presented
under
the
governing
text
of
the
absolute
priority
rule
is
whether
they
received
that
property,
quote,
on
account
of
their
prior
equity
interest.
we
believe
they
did
for
two
reasons.
first,
the
ordinary
meaning
of
the
phrase
"on
account
of"
requires
an
inquiry
into
causation.
the
absolute
priority
rule,
thus,
asks
whether
there
is
a
causal
nexus
between
the
prior
junior
equity
interest
and
the
retentions
of
property.
that
causal
nexus
is
clearly
present
in
this
case.
under
the
reorganization
plan,
the
junior
partner...
the
junior
interests,
the
partners,
and
only
those
partners,
were
allowed
to
receive
interest
in
the
reorganized
debtor.
now,
justice
scalia,
you
asked
about
whether
that
was
in
fact
an
option
under
the
plan.
and
under...
under
section
5.2
of
the
plan,
which
is
at
the
joint
appendix,
pages
38
through
39,
section
4.5(d),
which
is
also
at
joint
appendix,
page
38,
it
says
clearly
that
the
decision
whether
or
not
to
make
a
payment
to
purchase
this
new
equity
interest
will
be
made
2
business
days
after
confirmation
of
the
plan.
and
then,
the
default
provision
of
the
plan,
section
6.1,
which
is
joint
appendix,
page
46,
says
what
will
happen
if
the
contributions
aren't
made.
this
previous
position...
previous
provisions
that
i
cited
also
address
what
happens
to
people
who
do
not
exercise
the
options.
so
we
think
that's
clearly
under
the
plan.
and,
in
addition,
it's
important
to
understand
what
the
concept
of
the
under
plan
means.
it's...
it's
much
like
under...
under
law,
the
authority...
there
was
no
authority
to
have
this
option
or
to
acquire
interest
without
a
plan.
so
we
believe
it
was
clearly
under
the
plan.
under
the
plan,
no
one...
no
one
else
could
acquire
these
ownership
interests.
thus,
there
was
a
100
percent
certain...
certainty,
excuse
me...
that
partners,
because
they
were
partners,
because
they
had
junior
interests--
ms.
petitioner
patricia
a
millett
--well,
this
court
has
recognized
that
you
can
have
more
than
one
cause
for
an
event.
we
don't
dispute
that
money
was
an
additional
requirement.
but
money
alone
was
not
enough.
the
bank
would
have
liked
to
put
in
money
and
was
ready
to
put
in
money,
but
that
was
not
enough.
the
status
as
a
junior
equity
holder,
as
a
partner,
was
a
necessary
and
indispensable
cause
to
acquiring
this
interest.
and--
ms.
petitioner
patricia
a
millett
--i
believe...
i
believe
so.
i'm
not...
we
have
not
seen
the
copy
of
the
bank's
plan--
ms.
petitioner
patricia
a
millett
--i'm
sorry,
i
don't
know
that.
ms.
petitioner
patricia
a
millett
a
liquidation
plan,
that's
correct.
ms.
petitioner
patricia
a
millett
that's
absolutely
right.
and
so
there
was
a
100
percent
certainty
that
partners
and
only
partners,
because
they
were
partners,
would
end
up
in
possession
of
this
property.
we
think
that
falls
within
the
plain
language
of--
ms.
petitioner
patricia
a
millett
--well,
first
of
all,
it's
not
totally
clear--
ms.
petitioner
patricia
a
millett
--i
think
we
don't
know
yet,
because
there
was
no
competition.
we
don't
know.
ms.
petitioner
patricia
a
millett
well,
a
couple...
a
couple
of
things.
first
of
all,
there
was
an
exclusive...
we're...
we're...
this
all
occurred
within
the
period
of...
of
exclusivity.
which
means--
ms.
petitioner
patricia
a
millett
--no
one
else
could
submit
a
plan.
ms.
petitioner
patricia
a
millett
well,
under...
under
reorganization,
you
can't
just
come
in
off
the
street
and
produce
a
plan.
you
have
to--
ms.
petitioner
patricia
a
millett
--you
have
to
have
a
plan
submitted.
and
then...
and
then,
as...
as
the
bank
discovered,
you
have
to
not
only
have
someone
submit
a
plan,
but
get
the
court
to
agree
to
lift
the
period
of
exclusivity
so
that
that
plan
can
be
considered.
but
had...
i
mean
the
important
thing
is
that...
we
have
to
keep
two
things
in
mind
on
the
amount
here...
it's
conceded
that
the
tax
li...
liability
that
they
were
trying
avoid
was
up
to
20
million
dollars#
and
then
why
a...
a
present
value
of
20
million
dollars...
and
yet
they
only
had
to
kick
in
present
value
4
million
dollars
to
preserve
that.
now,
i
think
it's
certainly
fair
to
assume
that
had
there
been
some
competition
that
they
would
have
been
willing
to
go
up
to
19
or
close
to
20
million
dollars.
you
have--
ms.
petitioner
patricia
a
millett
--right.
right.
ms.
petitioner
patricia
a
millett
the
exclusive
condition
on
bidding
and
purchasing?
ms.
petitioner
patricia
a
millett
i
believe...
i
believe...
yes...
in
large
part,
yes.
there
may
be
some
other
circumstances
we
would
need
to
consider
in
a
particular
case,
but
that
is
an
enormous
factor
in
deciding
that
this
was
on
account
of.
now,
why
is
this
so
important,
this
exclusivity?
it's
important
to
understand
that--
ms.
petitioner
patricia
a
millett
--well--
ms.
petitioner
patricia
a
millett
--it
makes
sense,
first
of
all,
because
the
statutory
text
puts
a
special
restricted
status
on
the
holders
of
junior
interest.
that's
the
first
answer.
and...
and
there's
a
good
reason
for
congress
to
do
that.
and
it's
important
to
understand
that
the
absolute
priority
rule
is
not
just
about
money.
it
reflects
a
historic
concern
with
insider
self-dealing
at
the
expense
of
creditors.
and
in...
the
insiders,
the
partners
here,
will
have...
will
have
the,
because
of
the
benefits
of
being
debtor
in
possession
and
of
their
position,
information
that
won't
be
available
to
others
that
will
allow
them
to
know
about
the
value
of
the
company
and
take
advantage
of
that.
but
in
addition,
another
thing
the
absolute
priority
rule
does...
remember,
we're
in
a
reorganization,
where
this
entity
is
going
to
continue,
many
times
in
cooperation
with
its
creditors,
and
the
creditors
have
a
right
to
limit
the
ability
of
the
equity
holders
to
stay
in
control
of
that
reorganized
debtor.
and
then
to...
especially
in
a
manner
that's
going
to
benefit
themselves,
to
set
their
own
price
for
new
equity
interests
to
exclusively
and
completely
take
control
of
the
enterprise
while
forcing
a
bank,
housing
and
urban...
the...
the
department
of
housing
and
urban
development,
or
another
senior
creditor
into
long-term,
unwanted
financial
relationships
solely
to
benefit
the
junior
interests.
so
it's
not
just
a
matter
of
money;
it's
also...
if...
if...
essentially
the
absolute
priority
rule
says
if
you
want
to
stay
in
control,
having
presided
over
the
bankruptcy
of
this
entity,
you
have
to
either
not
impair
us,
pay
us
in
full
or
make
us
happy
to
continue
working
with
you.
and
that's
our
view
of
why
they
would
be
uniquely
impaired.
ms.
petitioner
patricia
a
millett
no,
we
were...
we
have
not
been
involved.
this
is
our
first
appearance--
ms.
petitioner
patricia
a
millett
--there
is...
i
think
you're
talking
about
1129(c).
ms.
petitioner
patricia
a
millett
the
argument...
the
argument
can
be
made...
it's...
it's
admitted
that
it
was
to
avoid
a
capital
gains
tax.
the
internal
revenue
service's
application
of
1129(c)
has
actually
been
very,
very
narrow.
and
where
someone
is
just
avoiding,
in
a
legal
and
proper
manner,
a
taxable
event,
then
we
have
not
invoked
it
although
the
statutory
tax
arguably
might
allow
that
should
we
change
our
position.
but
also
it
does
require
that
we
would
have
been
a
party
in
interest,
and
we
are
not
a
party
in
interest
in
this
case.
ms.
petitioner
patricia
a
millett
i
don't
believe
in
this
case
that
it
does...
that...
that
it
does.
i
think
we
are
in
agreement.
whether
in
hypotheticals
in
future
cases
we
would
consider
something
to
still
be
on
account
of
and
they
wouldn't,
i
don't
really...
it
hasn't
really
been
tested
by
this
case.
and
that's
because
whatever
your
definition
of
causation
and
whatever
your
definition
of
on
account
of,
a
100
percent
certainty
that
junior
equities
obtains
property
because
they're
junior
equity
will
satisfy
that.
