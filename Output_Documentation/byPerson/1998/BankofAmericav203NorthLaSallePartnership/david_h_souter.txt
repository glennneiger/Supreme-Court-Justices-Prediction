97-1418.
this
case
comes
to
us
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit.
petitioner
bank
of
america
national
trust
and
savings
association
lent
respondent
real
estate
partnership
some
$93
million
secured
by
a
mortgage
on
office
building
in
downtown
chicago
owned
by
the
partnership.
after
the
partnership
defaulted
it
filled
a
voluntary
chapter
11
bankruptcy
petition
in
order
to
retain
the
property.
the
partners
wanted
to
do
that
because
they
would
thereby
avoid
paying
some
$20
million
in
taxes
that
they
have
owed
if
the
bank
had
foreclosed
on
the
property.
because
the
value
of
the
mortgage
property
was
less
than
the
balance
due
to
the
bank,
the
bank’s
loan
could
not
be
paid
in
full
and
the
partnership
proposed
to
reorganization
plan
during
the
period
in
which
it
alone
had
the
statutory
right
to
file
a
plan.
the
key
feature
of
the
partners
plan
was
an
exclusive
eligibility
provision,
allowing
some
of
the
partners
to
contribute
new
capital,
in
order
to
retain
a
100%
of
the
shares
in
the
reorganized
partnership.
the
bank
objected,
and
the
plan
therefore
could
not
be
confirmed
by
consent
or
classes
of
creditors.
the
partners
then
attempted
what
is
known
as
“cramdown”
over
the
objection
of
the
bank.
section
1129(b)(1)
of
the
bankruptcy
code
provides
that
in
order
to
be
confirmed
as
a
"cramdown"
plan,
a
reorganization
plan
must
be
fair
and
equitable
with
respect
to
an
objecting
impaired
class
of
creditors.
the
code
further
specifies
that
for
a
plan
that
does
not
pay
a
senior
class
of
creditors
claims
in
full,
the
holder
of
any
interest
that
is
junior
to
the
claims
to
the
that'd
been
impaired
creditor
class
will
not
receive
or
retain
any
property
under
the
plan
on
account
of
such
junior
interest.
the
bank
contended
that
the
plan
violated
this
provision,
which
is
known
as
the
“absolute
priority
rule”.
the
majority
of
the
panel
of
the
seventh
circuit
interpreted
the
phrase
on
account
of
as
permitting
recognition
of
a
new
value
corollary
to
the
absolute
priority
rule.
under
such
a
corollary
debtors
like
the
partners
in
this
case,
would
receive
their
shares
on
account
of
their
infusion
of
new
capital,
not
on
account
of
their
prior
position.
we
granted
certiorari
to
resolve
the
conflict
among
the
circuits
on
this
issue.
in
an
opinion
filed
today
with
the
clerk
of
court,
we
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
seventh
circuit.
while
we
do
not
decide
ultimately,
whether
the
statute
includes
a
new
value
corollary,
we
hold
that
on
any
reading,
even
assuming
the
existence
of
a
new
value
corollary,
the
plan
in
this
case
is
doomed
by
its
provision
for
vesting
equity
in
the
reorganized
business
in
the
partners
without
subjecting
the
partners
purchase
price
to
some
form
of
competition
by
giving
an
opportunity
for
others
to
bid
for
the
equity
or
else
to
propose
an
alternative
plan.
absent
such
competition,
this
exclusive
opportunity
should
be
treated
as
an
item
of
property
in
its
own
right,
which
was
extended
on
account
of
the
old
equity
position,
it
therefore
violates
the
absolute
priority
rule.
justice
thomas
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
the
judgment
which
justice
scalia
joins;
justice
stevens
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion.
