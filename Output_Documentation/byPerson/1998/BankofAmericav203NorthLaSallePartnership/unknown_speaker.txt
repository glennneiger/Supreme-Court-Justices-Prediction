unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
just
a...
i'm
a
little
fuzzy
on
the
facts.
it
retained
the
same
part...
it
was
the
same
owners
as
before?
unknown
speaker
it's
reconstituted
with
the...
some
partners
contributed
and
some
did
not;
is
that
right?
unknown
speaker
so
that
it's
actually
a
different
group
of
individuals
than
it
was
before?
unknown
speaker
if
it's
a
different
partnership,
in
effect,
do
they
have
different
partners?
unknown
speaker
are
there
any
individuals
in
the
new
partnership
that
were
not
in
the
former
one?
unknown
speaker
well,
the
new
partnership
still
preserved
the
tax
shelter,
right?
i
mean
the...
the
whole
problem
here
was
that
if
there
is
a
default
which
constitutes
a
sale,
there's...
there's
this
enormous
tax
bill
to
be
paid.
unknown
speaker
what
if
the
plan
here
had
let
any
creditor
participate
if
it
wanted
to--
unknown
speaker
--in
the
reorganization?
unknown
speaker
would
that
have
satisfied
the
claim
here
and
overcome
the
so-called
absolute
priority
rule?
unknown
speaker
and
what
section
is
that,
mr.
englert?
unknown
speaker
could
i
ask
you
a
quick
preliminary
question
just
to
test
my
knowledge.
why,
in
this
case,
since
your
clients
are
owed
i
guess
tens
of
millions
of
dollars,
isn't
it--
unknown
speaker
--yeah.
the...
the...
the
creditor
is
owed
tens
of
millions
of
dollars,
the
main
creditor.
unknown
speaker
right.
and...
and
the...
the...
the
only
other
class
are
a
group
of
people
who
are
owed
like
50,000
dollars.
unknown
speaker
all
right,
90,000.
so
why
wouldn't
the
major
creditor
just
have
paid
them
their
90,000
dollars?
am
i
right,
that
if...
if
your
client
had
just
said,
i'll
write
a
check
for
90,000
dollars,
you
get
the
money,
at
that
point
you
would
have
been
the
only
one
left.
unknown
speaker
and
then
there
would
have
been
no
doubt
they
couldn't
do
this.
unknown
speaker
no,
no,
no.
suppose
you...
they
would
have
thought...
if
you
were
the
only
creditor
left,
if
there
was
only
one
class
of
creditor,
because
you
had
paid
off
the
other
ones,
then
is
there
any
doubt
that
you
could
have
objected
to
a
cram
down
plan
or
not?
unknown
speaker
can
they
cram
down
a
plan
if
there
is
one...
the
only
creditor
is
the
one
who
is
being
sort
of
crammed
down,
so
to
speak?
unknown
speaker
why
can't
you
just
pay
them?
if
you
write
a
check,
don't
they
disappear?
unknown
speaker
yeah.
well,
is
this
a
test
case,
in
other
words?
is
this
some
kind
of
test
case?
or
is
there
some
good
economic
reason
why
you
couldn't
have
written
a
check
for
90,000,
gotten
rid
of
them,
and
then
won?
unknown
speaker
but
that
was
not
under
the
plan.
unknown
speaker
the
plan
didn't
give
them
the
right
to
buy
that
option.
unknown
speaker
it
did?
unknown
speaker
are
you
saying
that
if
an
equity
owner
is
ever
to
be
allowed
to
contribute
new
value,
that
that
must
be
made
available
on
the
same
terms
and
conditions
to
all...
to
the...
to
all
persons?
unknown
speaker
yes.
but
if
you
always
had
creditor
consent,
would
you
ever
have
a
cram-down?
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
but
isn't
it...
is
it
not
a
given
in
every
cram-down
that
some
senior
creditor
objected?
unknown
speaker
but
is
it
not
also
true
that
whenever
a
cram-down
is
approved,
some
objector
has
been
not
paid
in
full?
unknown
speaker
okay.
unknown
speaker
so
there
could
never
be
a
cram-down
unless
equity
owners
and
non-equity
owners
are
treated
on
an
equal
basis
so
far
as
new
value
participation?
unknown
speaker
before
you
get
to
the
legislative
history,
would
you
just
answer...
make
sure
you've
answered
one
question.
would
your
position...
is
your
reading
of
the
statute
the
same
as
if
the
words
"on
account
of"
were
deleted
from
the
statute?
unknown
speaker
and
tell
me
what
the
difference
is.
unknown
speaker
but
if
you...
if
you
deal
only
with
the
cases
where
everybody
is
only
a
member
of
one
class,
you
say
there
are
some
people
who
are
members
both
debtors
and
equity
holders.
unknown
speaker
but
if
everybody
just
was...
only
fit
in
one
class
and
you
don't
have
membership
in
more
than
one
class,
then
would
the
statute
mean
exactly
the
same
thing
whether
the
words
"on
account
of"
were
included
or
deleted?
unknown
speaker
so
you're
concerned
only
with
cases
in
which
the
equity
position
is
not
the
highest
bidder?
unknown
speaker
no.
but
presumably,
if
somebody
had
come
in
with
more
money
and
told...
and
somebody
advised
the
bankruptcy
judge...
that
you
can
get
more
money
by
somebody
else
is
going
to
put
into
the
operation,
presumably
the
judge
wouldn't
have
approved
the
plan.
unknown
speaker
can
you
elaborate
a
bit
on
this
open
auction,
which
we
don't
even
know
whether
this
is
already
the
order,
but
you
did
answer
the
one-horse
race,
to
say
no,
of
course
there
would
be
a
two-horse
race,
and
the
bank
would
always
have
the
stronger
horse,
because
it
could
pay...
it
could...
i
forgot
what
footnote
it
was
in
which
you
explained
that,
but--
unknown
speaker
--suppose
the
court
had
said
that
the
bank
could
contribute
dollar
for
dollar
with
the
equity
holders
and
receive
a
proportionate
share
of
the
equity.
unknown
speaker
not,
not
quite
exclusivity.
we'll
say
we'll...
we'll
allow
the
bank
to
participate
on
the
same
terms
as
the--
unknown
speaker
--because?
unknown
speaker
well,
but
you're
getting
the
same...
the
same
deal,
and
you're
not
receiving
it
on
account
of
your
prior
equity
interest.
unknown
speaker
so
how
can
that
be?
unknown
speaker
well,
but
i...
i...
i'm
not
so
sure.
if...
if
they
have
the
right
and
you
have
the
right,
then
it's
not
just
because
of
their...
of
their
position.
unknown
speaker
well,
that
would
be
the
case
if
you
had
an
auction
in
which
only
the...
only
the
debtors
and
creditors
were
allowed
to
participate
in.
unknown
speaker
you...
you
have
to
let
john
doe
walk
in
off
the
street
and
participate
in
that.
unknown
speaker
is
it...
suppose
that...
not
this
case...
but
imagine
a
case
in
which
a
large,
under-secured
creditor
has,
let's
say,
50
million
dollars
of
unsecured
debt.
and
it's
a
company
that
has
a
lot
of
employees.
and
the
bankruptcy
judge
thinks,
i
wish
this
company
could
survive,
because
it
would
be
good
for
the
community,
the
employees.
but
if
this
unsecured
creditor
gets
it,
he's
going
to
sell
it
for
scrap,
basically.
so
i
think
i
see
new
capital
coming
in
here.
and
i
would
like,
even
though
that
unsecured
creditor
objects,
to
make
this
go
forward.
under
your
view
of
the
case,
would
that
be
possible?
is
it
ever
possible
on
their
view
of
the
case?
is
it...
what's
the
status
of
that?
unknown
speaker
well,
he
could
have
a
competitive
bid
but
exclude
the
big
creditor
from
that.
i
mean
that's
logically
possible.
he
could
say,
we're
going
to
have
a
competitive
bid
but
a
competitive
bid
among
people
who
want
to
keep
the
company
in
business.
unknown
speaker
is
that
possible
legally?
unknown
speaker
no.
my...
my
theory...
my
hypothetical
is
that
there
are
500,000
people
in
the
world
who
will
put
in
6
million
dollars
of
new
capital.
and
he's
indifferent,
among
all
those
500,000,
but
one.
the
one
he
doesn't
want
is
your
equivalent.
now,
can
he
do
that?
unknown
speaker
because?
unknown
speaker
mr.
englert,
you
said
that...
that
your
client,
the
bank,
put
in
a
competing
plan,
but
that
that
was
rejected.
unknown
speaker
oh.
but
you
actually
didn't
file
anything?
unknown
speaker
how
did
it
compare,
the
plan
that
you
tendered,
with
the
one
that
the
mortgagee
tendered
in
the
coltex
case?
was
it
similar
or
you
don't
know?
unknown
speaker
very
well,
mr.
englert.
ms.
millett.
unknown
speaker
but...
but
let
me
just
interrupt
there.
some
partners
did
acquire
an
interest.
some
did
not.
those
that
acquired
it
put
in
some
cash.
and
on
account
of
the
fact
they
put
in
the
cash,
they
got
an
interest.
those
that
did
not
put
in
cash
did
not
get
an
interest.
now,
why...
i
don't
see
that
it's
because
they
were
partners
that
they
got
the
interest.
it's,
rather,
because
they
put
in
the
cash.
unknown
speaker
and
does
the
record
show
the
bank
was
prepared
to
put
in
new
money
that
would
not
have
been
just
used
to
retire
their
own
debt
in
a
larger
amount
than...
than
these
people
were?
unknown
speaker
i'm
just
asking
whether
the
record
shows
whether
they
would
or
not.
you
don't
know?
if
you
don't--
unknown
speaker
--the
bank's
plan
was
a
liquidation
plan,
i
thought.
unknown
speaker
yeah.
right.
well,
at
any
rate,
under
this
plan,
nobody
else
had
the
opportunity
to
put
up
any
money
than
the
people
who
finally
put
it
up;
isn't
that
correct?
unknown
speaker
well,
but...
but
let
me
just...
maybe
it's
just
that
i
don't
have
enough
familiarity
with
reorganization
positions...
but
what
if
a
stranger
came
in,
not
seeking
liquidation,
as
i
gather
the...
the...
you
suggest
the
bank's
plan
was,
but
offering
more
new
money
into
the
plan,
and
that
was
known
to
the
bankruptcy
judge,
and
more
money
available
from
others.
is
there
anything
to
indicate
the
judge
would
have
thought
this
plan
fair
and
equitable?
unknown
speaker
see,
i...
the
way
i
understood
the
case...
maybe
i'm
wrong...
i
understood
the
fact
that
these
people
have
a
huge
tax
loss
that
makes
them
willing
to
put
in
more
new
money
than
anybody
else
around.
and
therefore
they
are,
almost
by
definition,
the
highest
bidder
available
for
this
property
that
would
put
in
new
money.
now,
is
that
an
incorrect
understanding
of
the
facts?
unknown
speaker
but
if
there
were...
i
mean
was
there
anything
to
prevent
a
stranger
from
coming
in
with
more
money
and
letting
the...
you
know,
making
an
offer
to
the
creditors
and
so
forth,
and
that
would
be
known
by
the
judge,
and
the
judge
then
would
say,
well,
i'm
not
going
to
approve
this
plan
because
there's
more
money
available
from
outsiders?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
understand.
but
in
that
period--
unknown
speaker
--somebody
finds
out
about
this
and
wants
to
buy
the
business
and
comes
in
with
some
money.
unknown
speaker
no,
you
have
to
get
a
creditor
to...
to
make
your
position
known
to
the
judge.
unknown
speaker
but
what
you're
saying
is
the
only
thing
they
would
have
had
to
have
done
to
save
this
would
simply
have
been
to
open
the
class
beyond
the
exclusive...
beyond
the
exclusive
condition
of
prior
equity
ownership,
and
then
we
would
have
found
out
whether
anybody
else
would
step
up
to
the
plate?
that's
the
nub
of
your
argument?
that
would
have
given
us
some...
some
information.
but
i
want
to
make
clear
one
thing,
that
even
when
a
number
of
plans
are
submitted,
the
absolute
priority
rule
and
the
requirements
in
1129(b)
must
be
satisfied
as
to
the
actual
plan
that
is
confirmed.
so
had
50
different
plans
been
submitted
here
and
the
court
had
still
chosen
this
one,
we
would
still
say
there
was
a
violation
of
the
absolute
priority
because
this
plan
is--
--because
this
one
would
have
had
the...
the
exclusive
condition
of
prior
equity
ownership?
unknown
speaker
and...
and
so
that's
why
i
said,
your...
your
position,
i
take
it,
is
that
remove
that
exclusive
condition
and
there's
no
further
problem
so
far
as...
as
this
provision
is
concerned?
unknown
speaker
yeah.
unknown
speaker
but
before
you
get
on
to
that,
i'm
troubled
by
the
fact
that
this
puts
this
the
debtor
in...
in
a
worse
position
than
anybody
else.
anybody
else
could
come
in
and
offer,
you
know,
15
million
of
new
value
and
be
able
to
proceed
with
a
plan.
they
could
come
in
and
offer
19
million
of
new
value
and
not
be
able
to
proceed
with
a
plan.
unknown
speaker
why
does
that
make
sense?
unknown
speaker
did
the
government
appear
in
this...
in
this
proceeding
below?
unknown
speaker
could
you
have...
could
the
argument
have
been
made
that
this
was
for
the
avoidance
of
taxes?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
how
does
your
position
differ
from
the
petitioner's,
if
it
does?
unknown
speaker
thank
you,
ms.
millett.
mr.
bendix,
we'll
hear
from
you.
unknown
speaker
whose
interest
didn't
it
satisfy,
if
the
only
other
creditors
were
the
trade...
trade
creditors?
they
got
paid
in
full.
the
only
creditor
is
the
bank,
and
it
gets...
it
wants
that.
so
that's
one
thing
that
puzzled
me.
whose
interest
could
that
not
have
satisfied?
unknown
speaker
well,
who
is
that?
unknown
speaker
all
right.
how
much
money
did
they
get?
unknown
speaker
so
we're
talking
about
like
3,000
dollars
or
4,000
dollars,
is
that
what
that
was?
unknown
speaker
so
this
is
some
kind
of
a
test
case;
is
that
what...
i
take
it?
unknown
speaker
all
right.
unknown
speaker
yes,
yes.
your
quite
right.
i
just...
then,
if
we're
talking
about
really
not
this
case
but
this
is
a
test
for
many,
many
other
cases--
unknown
speaker
--what...
what
is
it
wrong
with...
with
what
has
been
suggested,
that
the
rule
simply
should
be
the
debtor
in
possession,
when
he
proposes
during
that
exclusive
period
his
plan,
in
your
kind
of
a
situation,
what
he
should
say
is
we,
the
past
equity
holders,
will
receive
equity
in
return
for
new
value
of,
let's
say,
10
million
dollars,
provided
that
anyone
but
for
the
principal
secured
creditor
who
wants
to
liquidate...
let's
say
anyone
who
doesn't
want
to
liquidate...
puts
in
more.
if
anyone
who
doesn't
want
to
liquidate
will
put
in
more,
then
of
course
we
concede;
they
get
the
equity,
not
us.
now
under,
what
would
be...
i'm
sure
there
are
things
wrong
with
that,
but
i...
i
ask
it
because
it
seems
to
me
that
would
be
consistent
with
the
statute.
whoever
ended
up
with
it,
including
the
old
holders,
wouldn't
be
getting
it
because
of
their
prior
equity
holding.
it
would
keep
what
you
want
not
to
happen
not
to
happen...
liquidation.
unknown
speaker
then
you
would
have
lost
absolutely
nothing
by
having
that
condition
in,
because
there
would
have
been
no
such
person
to
put
in
more
equity.
unknown
speaker
but
what,
mr.
bendix,
then
what
is
your
interpretation
of
the
"on
account
of"
language?
unknown
speaker
on
account
of.
unknown
speaker
well,
but
that
really
is
parsing
words
rather
finely,
to
say
they
don't
receive
it
because
they're
creditors
but
because
of
their
pre-petition
claim.
it's
their
pre-petition
claims
that
makes
them
creditors.
unknown
speaker
i
don't...
it
seems
to
me
you're
going
around
robin
hood's
barn
here.
"on
account
of",
you've
heard
what
the...
what
the
petitioners
argue,
that
it
means...
it
means...
it
has
a
causal
connection.
and
do
you
have
a
brief
response
to
that?
unknown
speaker
well,
it
may
not
have
anything
to
do
with
the
purpose,
but
lots
of
times
congress
may
have
a
purpose
in
mind,
but
it
adopts
language
that
may
carry
out
that
purpose,
may
be
broader
than
the
purpose,
may
be
narrower
than
the
purpose.
so
what
do
you
say
"on
account
of"
means?
unknown
speaker
mr.
bendix,
may...
may
i
ask
you
a
question
about
the...
the
absolute
priority
rule...
which
sounds
like,
you
know,
what
it
says,
that
the
senior
creditor
has
to
be
paid
in
full
before
the
next...
and
then
the
case
in
which...
the
case...
case
in
which
douglas
presented
this
corollary
or
new
value
exception.
he
was
talking
about
necessity
to
keep
a
going
concern
going.
when
you
think
of
going
concern,
a
business
with
goodwill,
with
employees.
here
we
have
nothing
at
stake
for
anybody
other
than
to
preserve
this
leaky
tax
shelter.
so
i...
i
really
don't
comprehend
how
you
would
even
satisfy
the
necessity
standard
of
the
new
value,
if
i
comprehend
douglas
right,
that
what
he
had
in
mind
was
keeping
a
going
concern
going,
where
there
are
employees
and
suppliers
and
all
that.
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
i'm
asking,
what
is
that
absolute
priority
rule?
and
if
i
think
douglas
used
the
word,
in
describing
it,
"necessity",
necessity
for
keeping
something
going,
these
are
going
to
be
the
same
tenants,
nobody
is
going
to...
i
think
one
of
the
briefs
put
it,
the
only
change
would
be
who
the
managing
agent
pays
the
rent
to.
unknown
speaker
well,
that...
that
all
depends
on
how
much
the
property
would
have
sold
for.
i
mean,
the
reason
the
bank
didn't
like
it
was
that
they...
they
disagreed
with
that.
they
thought
the
property
would
have
sold
for
a
lot
more
than
the
6
million.
unknown
speaker
in
answer
to
justice
ginsburg's
question,
i
suppose
the
going
concern
value
here
is
postponing
the
capital
gain,
really?
unknown
speaker
indicated
in
the
economic
motivation
to
keep
the
business
going?
unknown
speaker
what
would
your
view
be
on
a
case
that's
similar
to
this
one
but
with
the
following
difference:
you
have
a
plan.
you
put
it
forward
just
like
the
one
you
have.
what
was
it,
9
million...
6...
i
forget...
6
million
you
put
in?
unknown
speaker
6.125.
and
suppose
a
creditor
says,
you
know,
i...
i
have
a
plausible
person
over
here
who
will
put
in
8
million.
and
he'll
put
in
8
million
if
he
gets
the
shares.
and
the
bankruptcy
judge
says,
no,
i'm
not
going
to
consider
that;
i'm
going
to
adopt
your
plan.
suppose
those
were
the
facts.
would
there
be
any
way
to
avoid
saying,
in
that
case,
that
the
old
owners
got
the
equity
on
account
of
their
prior
ownership?
just
like
this
case,
but
we
have
really
someone
who
comes
in
and
wants
the...
wants
this--
unknown
speaker
--i
don't
know
all
those
things.
i
mean
there
could
be
complicated
cases.
but--
unknown
speaker
--but
i'm
thinking
it's
just
like
this
case,
but
we
have
a
real
bidder
out
there
for
8
or
10
million,
and
he...
and
the
only
reason
really
the
bankruptcy
judge
is
doing
it
is...
is
it
then
not
on
account
of?
and
you
say
no,
because--
unknown
speaker
--but
then
it
seems
we're
not
arguing
about
very
much.
because
then
all
you'd
have
to
do...
even
on
their
theory...
is...
is
put
a
provision
in...
maybe
not
on
their
theory,
but
put
a
provision
in
and
say,
we
aren't
the
exclusive
ones;
we'll
let
anyone
else
who
wants
to
keep
it
going
as
a
going
business
do
it.
and...
and
it's
just
a
question
of
that
boiler
plate.
because
if
in
fact
there
is
such
a
person,
you
agree,
he
should
get
it?
that
would
work
in
all
cases
except
yours,
because
of
the
tax
problem
that...
that
you
had.
you
couldn't
let
other
people
in.
but...
but
in
the
ordinary
case,
why
wouldn't
that
happen?
unknown
speaker
no,
no.
but
the
virtue
of
the
auction
of
course
is
that
it
gets
around
this
"on
account
of".
naturally
it
doesn't
appear.
unknown
speaker
but
where
it's
an
auction,
you
can't
possibly
say
it's
on
account
of.
unknown
speaker
but,
mr.
bendix,
it
is...
it
is
essential,
for
the
preservation
of
the...
the
tax
benefit,
that
you
have
the...
this
exclusivity,
that
you
be
the
only
ones
that...
that
end
up
as
equity
holders.
unknown
speaker
you
cannot
have
anybody
bidding
against
you;
that
would
defeat
the
whole
thing?
unknown
speaker
well,
but
it
might
be
possible,
if
there
were
other
people
who
felt
that
the
property
had
been
undervalued,
to
bid
up...
requiring
your
clients
to
bid
up,
so
they
end
up
paying,
but
they
end
up
paying
not
6
million,
but
10
million,
maybe?
unknown
speaker
the
question
is,
why
should
the
judge
be
the
judge
of
that
rather
than
what
is
the
only
substantial
creditor
in
the
picture?
unknown
speaker
mr.
bendix,
what
about
the
argument
that
when
this
new
value
corollary
came
in,
in
the
case
case,
that
the
bankruptcy
act
was
structured
differently,
so
that
you
could
have
one
recalcitrant
creditor
holding
up
the
whole
works
and
everybody
else
is
willing
to
go
through,
now
the
bankruptcy
act
has
taken...
the
bankruptcy
code
has
taken
care
of
that
by
having
classes
of
creditors
and
you
can't
have
just
one
creditor
holding
out,
so
that
the
problem
that
that
was
addressing
is
now
handled
in
a
different
way?
unknown
speaker
well,
even
if...
if
it
wasn't
properly
described
as
an
option,
it
included
an
option,
did
it
not?
unknown
speaker
well,
but
the
bank...
it
was
the
bankruptcy
plan
that
gave
them
the
legal
rights,
i
take
it?
unknown
speaker
but
are
you
saying,
then,
they
didn't
receive
any
property
within
the
meaning
of
(b)(2)(b)(ii)?
unknown
speaker
how
does
that
differ...
how
does
that
make
your
case
any
better
for
purposes
of
(b)(2)(b)(ii)
and
the
"on
account
of"
language?
unknown
speaker
well,
because
of
their
prior
status,
they
and
they
alone
were
entitled
to
make
this
purchase.
unknown
speaker
well,
but
there
was
an
option,
because
all
the
partners
didn't
have
to
participate.
i
mean
each
individual
partner
had
an
option,
did
he
not?
unknown
speaker
did
that
mean
that
when
some
people
didn't
participate,
the
shares
of
the
others
had
to
be
that
much
larger?
unknown
speaker
okay.
unknown
speaker
were...
were
there
any
new
members
of
the
reorganized
firm
that
hadn't
been
members
of
the
old
one?
unknown
speaker
so
it
was
a
very
limited
universe
that
you're
talking
about?
unknown
speaker
why
are
people
arguing
about
option?
i
didn't
understand
that
part
of
it.
i
mean
they
got...
they
got
the
building.
they
got
the
building.
and
they
put
up
the
6
million.
and
i
thought
the
issue
in
the
case...
they
got
the
building
under
the
plan.
it
provided
that
they
get
the
building
for
the
6
million.
and
i
thought
we
were
arguing
about
whether
they
got
the
building
for
the
6
million
and
also
because
of
their
prior
ownership.
i
mean
i
don't
understand
why
it
matters
whether
we're
talking
about
an
op...
why
are
we
looking
for
an
option?
they...
we
must
be.
because
i
agree
with
you,
they
want
to.
but
can
you
explain
it
to
me?
unknown
speaker
why...
why
isn't
enough
for
the
case
that
you
got
the
equity?
you
got
the
equity,
you
got
the
building.
you
got
the
equity.
you
put
up
6
million.
you
say,
we
got
it
just
because
of
the
6
million.
you...
they...
as
far
as
the
statute
is
concerned,
they
say
you
got
it
because
of
the
6
million
and
also
on
account
of
other
prior
ownership.
so
how
does
it
change
the
case?
unknown
speaker
if
i
drop
the
option
out
in
my
mind,
is
it
going
to
make
a
difference
to
the
decision?
unknown
speaker
in
substance,
this
so-called
option
is
nothing
more
or
less...
as
i
take
it...
than
the
limited
eligibility
to
put
up
the
6
million.
that's
all
it
means,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
isn't
that
a
valuable
right?
unknown
speaker
well,
but
where
does
the
provision
say
it
has
to
be
property
as
distributed
under
the
plan?
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
what's...
what's
the
exact
language
that
you
rely
on?
unknown
speaker
the
reason
i
ask
the
question
is
that
subsection
(2)...
(2)(b)(ii)
refers
to
any
property.
unknown
speaker
and
that...
which
sounds
pretty
broad.
unknown
speaker
where
are
you
reading
from?
unknown
speaker
i
guess
if
we
take
the
bank's
brief--
--(b)(2)(b)(ii)
or--
unknown
speaker
--so
are
you
saying
you
didn't
receive
any
property
under
the
plan?
unknown
speaker
no,
but
you
also
received
another
ben...
or
would
have
received
another
benefit
under
the
plan.
and
that
was
the
exclusive
opportunity
to
acquire
or
retain
that
equity
interest.
unknown
speaker
well,
in
the
sense
that
you
undertake,
by
presenting
the
plan,
to
exercise
that
opportunity.
so
that
i
suppose,
you
know,
there
is
a
legal
instant
in
time
in
which
all
of
this
occurs.
but
it's
still
the
case
that
at
the
moment
the
plan
becomes
operative,
you
have
an
opportunity,
and
nobody
else
can
have
one.
unknown
speaker
thank
you,
mr.
bendix.
mr.
englert,
you
have
3
minutes
remaining.
unknown
speaker
what
case
is
that?
unknown
speaker
of
course,
if
we
meant
that
literally,
we
shouldn't
have
left
the
question
open.
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
wasn't
that
with
regard
to
the
bill
they
didn't
enact?
unknown
speaker
that
may
be
wrong.
unknown
speaker
no,
there
is
no
new
cash
in
that
deal.
unknown
speaker
in
the
farmer
deal?
unknown
speaker
yeah.
unknown
speaker
that
was
precisely
the
kind
of
economic
value
that
justice
douglas
said
should
not
count.
unknown
speaker
yeah.
but...
and
he
said
the
other
with
respect
to
cash.
