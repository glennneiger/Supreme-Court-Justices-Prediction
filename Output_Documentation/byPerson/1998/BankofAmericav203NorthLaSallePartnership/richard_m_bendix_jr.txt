mr.
richard
m.
bendix,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
want
to
start
by
answering
a
question
that...
one
or
two
questions
that
had
been
asked
earlier
in
the
argument.
the
bank
did
propose
a
plan
of
reorganization
here,
or
asked
to
propose
a
plan
of
reorganization,
which
was
a
plan
of
liquidation.
it's
really
not
correct
for
the
bank
to
stand
up
here
and
say
they
were
proposing
to
put
in
money,
when
their
plan
was
a
plan
of
liquidation
that
did
not
propose
to
put
in
6
million
dollars
or
any
lesser
sum.
it
was
a
proposed
plan
of
liquidation
that
was
defective
on
its
face
because
it
didn't
satisfy
the
best
interest
of
creditors
test.
and
that's
why
the
court
properly
denied
the
bank's
motion.
the
bank
could
have
appealed.
it
chose
not
to.
and
this
whole
auction
argument
i
think
is
simply
an
attempt
to--
mr.
richard
m.
bendix,
jr.
--well,
justice
breyer,
if
i
understand
your
question,
the
unsecured
class
was
impaired
in
this
case.
which
meant
that
they
were
not
paid
everything
that
they
were
entitled
to.
mr.
richard
m.
bendix,
jr.
that
was
the
class
of
trade
creditors.
mr.
richard
m.
bendix,
jr.
they
got
the
principal
amount
of
their
claim.
they
did
not
get
interest.
the
correct
amount
is--
mr.
richard
m.
bendix,
jr.
--that's
correct.
mr.
richard
m.
bendix,
jr.
i
believe
it's
a
test
case,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
m.
bendix,
jr.
and
it's
important
to
point
out
that
the
amount
of
claims
in
a
particular
class
is
not
relevant
to
the
fair
and
equitable--
mr.
richard
m.
bendix,
jr.
--and
i
think--
mr.
richard
m.
bendix,
jr.
--the
difficulty
with
that
example,
justice
breyer,
is
that
any
dilution...
because
of
the
tax
laws
in
this
case...
any
dilution
of
the
ownership
would
have
basically
destroyed
the
ability
to
defer
the
taxation.
and
it
was
that
ability
to
defer
the
taxes,
not
to
avoid
taxes,
but
to
defer
the
capital
gain,
that
ability
to
defer
was
the
economic
incentive
for
the
investors
to
put
money
in.
if
that
incentive
disappeared,
then
they
would
have
had
no
reason
or
economic
motivation
to
put
the
money
in.
mr.
richard
m.
bendix,
jr.
i
don't...
i
don't
know
whether
there
would
be
or
there
would
not
have
been,
your
honor.
but
it's...
it's
important
to
point
out
and
to
understand
what
the
confirmation
process
is.
section
1121
of
the
bankruptcy
code
gives
the
debtor
the
exclusive
right
to
file
a
plan
for
the
first
120
days
of
a
case.
that
is
clearly
a
valuable
right.
it's
a
right
to
set
the
agenda,
to
set
the
option.
it's
like...
somewhat
like
writing
the
first
draft
of
an
opinion.
congress
recognized
that's
a
valuable
right.
and
in
fact,
the
bank,
in
its
amici,
recognized
it
was
a
valuable
right.
because
in
1978,
when
this
particular
section
was
being
debated,
the
creditor...
the
secured
creditor
lobby,
which
is
here
today,
lobbied
to
do
away
with
debtor
exclusivity
altogether.
congress
decided
not
to
do
that
and
instead
to
have
a
compromise,
where
the
debtor
got
an
exclusive
right,
for
the
first
120
days,
which
could
be
shortened
for
cause
shown...
if
somebody
came
in
and
said,
i...
here
are
the
following
circumstances,
and
i
believe
that
they...
they
demonstrate
cause
for
terminating
the
exclusive
period,
the
bankruptcy
court
has
discretion.
once
a
plan
is
filed,
section
1123(a)(5)
says
that
the
plan
must
specify
the
means
of
implementation.
that
means
a
plan
has
got
to
say
where
the
money
is
coming
from
to
make
the
payments
required
under
the
plan.
the
code,
in
various
subparagraphs,
lists
examples
of
means
of
implementation.
and
one
of
them,
in
subparagraph
(j),
is
the
sale
of
the
securities
of
the
debtor
for
cash
or
in
exchange
for
claims
or
other
interests.
if
congress
had
meant
to
limit
the
debtor's
discretion
in
what
kind
of
package
it
was
going
to
put
together
in
an
offer
to
the
creditors
for
a
restructuring,
it
easily
could
have
said
so.
it
could
have
said
you've
got
to
specify
means
of
implementation.
you
can
sell
the
securities,
but
if
it's
the
debtor
proposing
a
plan,
you
must
do
it
by
way
of
auction
or
you
must
cut
other
people
in.
it
simply
didn't
say
that.
what
congress
decided
was
that
if
creditors
or
other
parties
and
interests
didn't
like
the
plan
and,
instead
of
simply
objecting
to
it,
wanted
to
propose
a
different
plan,
they
had
an
obligation,
under
section
1121(d),
i
believe,
to
come
in
and
ask
the
court
to
terminate
exclusivity.
and
if
the
court
terminated
exclusivity,
both
plans,
if
there
was
a
proper
disclosure
statement,
would
go
out
to
the
creditors.
the
creditors
would
vote.
and
if
both
plans
were
accepted
and
if
both
plans
met
all
of
the
requirements
of
1129,
then
the
bankruptcy
judge,
in
1129(c),
is
required
to
decide
between
those
plans,
and
choose
one
based
on
the
preferences--
mr.
richard
m.
bendix,
jr.
--my
interpretation,
your
honor,
is
that
it
means
an
exchange
for
or
synonyms
for
that,
such
as
in
satisfaction
of
or
in
consideration
of.
and
the
reason
we
take
this
position
is
that
the
phrase
must
be
interpreted
in
the
context
in
which
it
appears.
we're
talking
here
about
corporate
reorganizations,
companies
whose...
unable
to
meet
their
obligations
and
to
pay
their
interest
because
they
don't
have
enough
income,
and
they
make
a
proposal
to
creditors
to
restructure
the
capital
structure.
and
there
are
an
infinite
number
of
ways
that
a
troubled
company
can
restructure
its
finances.
you
can
extend
debt.
you
can
turn
debt
into
equity.
you
can
pay
a
percentage
on
the
dollar.
and
that's
why,
because
there
are
so
many
different
ways...
well,
let
me
go
back
to...
to
the
"in
exchange
for".
what
happens
in
a--
mr.
richard
m.
bendix,
jr.
--on
account
of.
what
happens
in
a
reorganization
is
that
new
obligations
or
property
are
exchanged.
they're
given
to
creditors
in
satisfaction
of
their
old
obligations
or
in
exchange
for
existing
securities.
for
example,
a
class
of
unsecured
creditors
might
get
under
the
plan
50
cents
on
the
dollar.
they
receive
that
not
because
they
are
creditors
but
in
satisfaction
of
their
pre-petition
claims.
similarly,
a
class
of
equity
holders
or
preferred--
mr.
richard
m.
bendix,
jr.
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
but
you
also
have
to
consider,
first,
that
we're
talking
about
a...
an
economic
situation
that
involves
exchange.
second,
i
think
we
submit
that
you
have
to
consider
the
meaning
of
"on
account
of"
in
relationship
to
what
the
absolute
priority
rule
is
designed
to
accomplish.
everybody...
one
of
the
few
things
that
everybody
agrees
on
in
this
case
is
that
section
1129(b)(2)(b)(ii)
is
the
so-called
absolute
priority
rule.
this
court
has
held
for
more
than
100
years
that
the
purpose
of
that
rule
is
to
prevent
transfers
for
less
than
a
fair
equivalent
value,
a
transfer,
if
you
will,
a
fraudulent
transfer.
what
that
means
in
the
context
of
a
reorganization
is
that
a
senior
class
of
creditors
that
has
not
been
paid
in
full
gets
first
claim
on
all
of
the
reorganization
value
of
the
company.
that's
all
they
get.
that
does
not
mean
that
somebody
can't
come
in
and...
well,
let
me
go
back.
if
some
of
that
reorganization
value
is
diverted
to
a
junior
class
of
stockholders,
for
instance,
then
the
senior
class
of
creditors
which
hasn't
been
paid
in
full,
hasn't
gotten
everything
that
it's
entitled
to.
mr.
richard
m.
bendix,
jr.
yes.
cause
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
purpose
of
the
absolute
priority
rule.
mr.
richard
m.
bendix,
jr.
we
say,
your
honor,
that
it
means
in
exchange
for
or
in
satisfaction
of.
and
as
a
fall-back,
as
we've
said
in
our
briefs,
even
if
you
were
to
take
the
position
that
it
meant
cause...
which
i
think
is
irrelevant
to
the
idea
of
whether
you
have
a
fair
exchange,
which
is
the
purpose
of
the
absolute
priority
rule...
even
if
you
said
it
meant
cause,
as
this
court
said
2
years
ago
in
the
o'gilvie
case,
cause
means
direct
cause.
and
it's
interesting
to
note
that
in
the
o'gilvie
case,
the
solicitor
general
filed
a
brief
with
this
court
saying
that
"on
account
of",
as
it
appeared
in
the
internal
revenue
code,
did
not
mean
but
for
a
cause,
where
any
sort
of
remote
fact
could
influence
the
decision,
but
meant
direct
cause.
they
haven't
mentioned
that
here
today.
if
you
take
a
causal
analysis,
then
it
must
mean
direct
cause.
and
direct
cause
is
a
question
of
fact,
which--
mr.
richard
m.
bendix,
jr.
--chapter
11
encompasses
far
more
than
operating
businesses.
as
this
court
has
held,
it
encompasses
individuals
that
don't
have
businesses.
it
certainly
encompasses
real
estate
partnerships.
old
chapter
12,
which
is
real
estate
partnerships,
was
intentionally
included
in
chapter
11.
so
the
fact
that
there
are
no...
there
aren't
a
large
number
of
employees
here
really
is
not
a
reason
that
you
shouldn't
apply
chapter
11,
and
the
absolute
priority
rule
in
particular.
mr.
richard
m.
bendix,
jr.
the
reason
why
reorganization
is
good
in
this
case...
if
i'm...
if
i'm
answering
your
question
properly...
is
that
it
allowed
creditors
to
realize
on
the
tax
problem
that
these
investors
had.
the
creditors
got
a
windfall,
got
more
money,
6
and
a
half...
or
6
and
a
quarter
million
dollars,
plus
the...
the
insiders
had
8
million
dollars
worth
of
claims,
which
they
waived,
and
thereby
gave
up
3
million
dollars
in
cash.
mr.
richard
m.
bendix,
jr.
they
did,
justice
scalia,
but
they
never
appealed
the
bankruptcy
court's
factual
finding
that
the
value
of
the
property
was
55.8
million
dollars.
and
it's
important
to
remember
in
this
case
that
the
bankruptcy
judge's
factual
decision
was
2.8
percent...
factual
valuation...
was
2.8
percent
less
than
the
value
which
the
bank's
own
appraiser
gave.
so
it
really
i
don't
think
is
proper
for
the
bank
to
come
in
here,
having
not
appealed
that
factual
determination,
and
suggest
that
the
bankruptcy
judge
made
a
mistake
or
to
say
that
because
bankruptcy
judges
may
make
mistakes
that
banks
should
have
the
right
to
decide
and
overrule
the
vote
of
other
creditors.
mr.
richard
m.
bendix,
jr.
in
a
real
sense,
yes,
justice--
mr.
richard
m.
bendix,
jr.
--it
allowed
the
creditors
to
get
the
benefit
of
something
that
the
debtor
didn't
own
and
didn't
have
a
right
to
sell.
the
tax
problem
was
something
unique
to
this
group
of
individuals.
it
wasn't
anything
that
appeared
on
the
balance
sheet
of
the...
of
the
company.
and...
and
because
of
that,
you're
correct,
that
they...
they
were
able
to
realize
on
this
thing
that
the
debtor
didn't
own
and
couldn't
sell.
mr.
richard
m.
bendix,
jr.
six
6.125
million
dollars.
mr.
richard
m.
bendix,
jr.
in
that
case,
the...
the
short
answer
to
your
question
is
that
the
owners
are
still
getting
something...
they're
getting
their
interest
only
on
account
of
the
money
they
put
in.
the
bankruptcy
judge...
you're
suggesting
by
your
question
that
perhaps
the
bankruptcy
judge
makes
a
mistake
or
abuses
his
discretion
in
not--
mr.
richard
m.
bendix,
jr.
--but
in--
mr.
richard
m.
bendix,
jr.
--well,
justice
breyer,
in
that
case,
frankly,
if
i
was
a
bankruptcy
judge,
i
would
terminate
the
exclusive
period
and
let
both
plans
go
out
to
creditors.
the
interesting
thing
about
the
bank's
position
is
that
they
say,
even
if
there
is
competing
plans,
and
even
if
the
debtor's
plan,
the
debtor's
new
value
plan,
puts
in
more
money,
that
somehow
the...
the
owners
have
still
gotten
something
on
account
of
their
prior
ownership
interest
and
the
debtor's
plan
couldn't
be
confirmed
without--
mr.
richard
m.
bendix,
jr.
--i
don't
know.
but
the
point
is
that
nowhere
in
the
bankruptcy
code
does
the
word
"auction"
appear.
and
it
certainly
doesn't
appear
in
any
of
the
provisions
dealing
with
what
a
plan
must
contain.
mr.
richard
m.
bendix,
jr.
well--
mr.
richard
m.
bendix,
jr.
--it
doesn't
appear.
and...
and
we
are
trying
to
interpret
the
plain
language
of
the
statute.
it
seems
anomalous
to
me
to
say
that,
if
you're
the
bank,
we're
relying
on
the
plain
language
of
1129(b)(2)(b)(ii),
and
it
clearly
says
that
the
only
time
a
plan
like
this
can
be
confirmed
is
if
you
have
an
auction.
and
in
fact,
in
footnote
6,
at
page
11
of
the
bank's
brief,
they
concede...
indirectly,
but
i
take
it
as
a
concession
nevertheless...
that
there
really
isn't
a
section...
there...
there
is
nothing
in
the
bankruptcy
code
that
permits
it.
it
says
it
raises
many
questions
about
whether
you
could
do
it.
the
fact
is
there
is
nothing
in
the
bankruptcy
code
that
requires
it
or--
mr.
richard
m.
bendix,
jr.
--that
is--
mr.
richard
m.
bendix,
jr.
--that
is
correct.
and
if
you
think
about
it,
who
else
besides
somebody
facing
a
tax
liability,
would
pay
6
million-plus
dollars
for
this
interest,
which
the
court
has
found
is
worthless
because
it's
completely
subordinate
to
the
bank's
deficiency
claim?
mr.
richard
m.
bendix,
jr.
well,
that's
possible.
the
interesting
fact
here
is
that...
it's
important
to
remember
that
the
bank
is
here,
arguing
as
an
unsecured
creditor.
1129(b)(2)(b)(ii)
and
the
absolute
priority
rule
only
applies
to
a
dissenting
class
of
unsecured
claims.
under
this
plan,
the
deficiency
claim
got
all
of
the
future
appreciation
in
the
building
until
its
claim
was
paid
in
full.
therefore,
what
difference
does
it
make
to
an
unsecured
creditor
who
gets
that
whether
the
building,
for
purposes
of
the
bank's
separate
secured
claim...
which
they're
not
here
contesting
today...
was
worth
a
million
dollars
more
or
less?
they
get
everything
that's
there
before
the
investors
got
a
penny.
and
that's
why
it
just
seems
obvious,
and
it
seemed
clear
to
the
judge,
that
this
was
a...
a
fair
price
to
pay
for
the...
for
the
equity
interest,
because
the
owners
get
nothing
back
except
this
tax
deferral
until
the
bank
has
been
paid--
mr.
richard
m.
bendix,
jr.
--because
that's
what
congress
has
said.
what
the
bank
is
really
doing
here
is
making
a
policy
argument
that
they
don't
like
bankruptcy
judges
second-guessing
their
decisions.
that's...
that's
a
plausible
policy
statement
to
make.
but
congress
said
judges
decide
value
and
judges
decide
whether
plans
are
fair.
if
they
don't
like
that,
they
are
perfectly
free
to
walk
across
the
street
and
argue
to
congress
that
the...
the
statute
should
be
changed.
but--
mr.
richard
m.
bendix,
jr.
--well,
the
earlier
cases
really
didn't
address
that
problem.
the
earlier
cases
addressed
the
problem
of
whether
the
unsecured
creditors
are
getting
all
of
the
reorganization
value
of
the
company
or
whether
something
is
being
diverted
to
a
junior
class.
the
change
in
the
bankruptcy
code
doesn't
affect
that.
what...
what
we
have
now
is,
instead
of
under...
as
under
old
chapter
10,
the
right
of
an
individual
creditor
to
object,
now
it
has
to
be
by
classes.
but
as
somebody
pointed
out
earlier,
the
absolute
priority
rule
only
comes
into
effect
if
you
have
one
class
that
agrees
and
one
class
that
disagrees.
so
the
analysis
that
you
go
through
with
respect
to
the
disagreeing
party...
whether
that
party
is
an
individual
creditor
or
class...
is
exactly
the
same
under
the
code
as
it
was
under
chapter
10
and,
indeed,
under
the
federal
equity
receivership
proceedings
that
existed
even
before
chapter
10.
the
change,
quite
simply,
has
no
effect
on
the
content
of
the
absolute
priority
rule.
i
want
to
address
for
a
moment
the
idea
that
there
was
an
exclusive
option
here.
justice
scalia,
i
think,
pointed
out
correctly
there's
nothing
in
the
plan
in
this
case
that
creates
an
option.
an
option
existed
in
the
case
that
we
cited
in
our
brief,
consolidated
rock.
there,
the
plan
said
the
old
owners
are
getting
an
option,
and
they're
not
paying
anything
for
it.
an
option
itself
is
not
a
bad
thing.
it's
simply
a
question
of
whether
you
pay
for
it.
the
language
of
the
plan
in
this
case
is
absolutely
clear
that
the
owners
had
an
obligation
to
put
the
money
in,
and
the
debtor
had
an
obligation
to
sell
the
equity
to
the
investors.
mr.
richard
m.
bendix,
jr.
no,
it
didn't,
mr.
chief
justice.
before
the
plan
was
confirmed,
the
debtor
had
this
exclusive
right
to
file
a
plan.
and
it
had
to
designate
somebody
who
was
going
to
put
the
money
in.
before
a
plan
is
confirmed,
it
is
nothing
more
than
an
offer.
it's
not
a
contract.
it
creates
no
legal
rights
or
obligations
unless
and
until
it's
been
confirmed
by
the
bankruptcy
court.
so,
yes,
of
course,
there
was
some...
in
some
colloquial
sense,
an
opportunity
that
these
people
had
before
confirmation,
but
they
had
no
legal
rights.
they
couldn't
exercise
an
option
and
say,
now...
now
give
me
my
stock.
mr.
richard
m.
bendix,
jr.
yes.
but
once
the
plan
is
confirmed,
you
have
a
consummated
sale.
the...
the
record
shows
in
this
case
that
the
money
for
the...
the
new
capital
was...
the
cash...
was
put
into
escrow
before
confirmation,
so
that
the
judge
would
be
satisfied
that
the
plan
would
be
feasible.
as
soon
as
the
plan
was
confirmed,
simultaneously,
the
money
went
out
and
the...
and
the
new
stock
came
back.
there
was
never
a
moment
in
time
here
where
there
was
any
discretion
in
the
sense
that
it
exists
under
an
option
where--
mr.
richard
m.
bendix,
jr.
--no,
not
at
all,
your
honor.
they...
they
received
a
very
obvious
form
of
property;
namely,
100
percent
of
the
equity
in
the
reorganized
company.
mr.
richard
m.
bendix,
jr.
well,
the
bank
is
not
here
arguing
that
our
purchase,
the
investors'
purchase
of
the
equity,
violated
the
statute.
they
say
disregard
that.
we
admit
that
that's
not
a
problem.
what
they're
saying
is
that
in
addition
to
the
actual
equity
interest
that
was
purchased,
there
was
this
so-called
option.
that's
what
they
hinge
their
case
on,
in
addition
to
whether
"on
account
of"--
mr.
richard
m.
bendix,
jr.
--that's
true
before
the
plan
was
confirmed,
and
even
afterwards.
any
time
you
have
a
contract...
if
i
sell
you
my
car,
nobody
else
but
you
can
buy
that
car.
that
doesn't
mean
that
you
have
gotten
some
option
in
addition
to
the
car
that
you've
purchased.
that's
inherent
in...
in
the
nature
of
a
completed
contract
for
the
sale
of
property.
what
they're
trying
to
do
is
create
a
separate
option
here,
separate
and
apart
from
the
obvious
form
of
property
that
was
purchased.
and
that
simply
doesn't
exist.
mr.
richard
m.
bendix,
jr.
not
in...
perhaps
in
a...
a
colloquial
sense,
but
not
in
the
sense
of
my
giving
you
an
option
to
buy
100
shares
of
my
stock
at
a
fixed
price
for
the
next
6
months.
there
was...
there
was
a
general
obligation
on
the
part
of
the
partners
to
put
in
6
million
dollars...
a
little
bit
more.
those
who
didn't
put
the
money
in
lost
their
interest.
in
a
true
option,
if
you
don't
exercise
your
option,
you
don't
suffer
the
kinds
of
legal
consequences
that
the
non-contributing
partners
suffered
in
this
case.
mr.
richard
m.
bendix,
jr.
effectively,
yes.
mr.
richard
m.
bendix,
jr.
sixty
percent
of
the
ownership
interest
changed
hands
under
this
plan.
people
received
interest
in
the
reorganized
firm
in
direct
proportion
to
the
amount
of
money
that
they
put
in.
and
the
amount
of
money
that
they
put
in
was
not
necessarily
related
in
any
way
to
their
pre-bankruptcy
percentage
ownership
interest.
mr.
richard
m.
bendix,
jr.
no,
mr.
chief
justice.
and,
again,
it's
important
to
remember
that
if
that
had
happened,
that
would
have
basically
destroyed
the...
the
tax
benefits
that
these
people
were
buying.
mr.
richard
m.
bendix,
jr.
that's
correct.
mr.
richard
m.
bendix,
jr.
the
bank
is
trying
to
say
that
we
got
some
form
of
property
in
addition
to
the
equity
that
we
purchased,
that
we--
mr.
richard
m.
bendix,
jr.
--well,
they
make
that
argument
with
respect
to
the
so-called
option,
justice
breyer.
they
don't
make
the
argument
with
respect
to
the
actual
equity
interest
that
was--
mr.
richard
m.
bendix,
jr.
--if
you
accept
our
interpretation
of
"on
account
of"
as
meaning
in
exchange
for
or
in
satisfaction
of,
then
of
course
our
position
is
that
we
received
this
equity
interest
in
exchange
for
the
new
money.
and,
again,
it's
important
to
remember
that
the
interests
of
non-contributing
partners
were
wiped
out.
so
they
received
absolutely
nothing
under
the
claim.
they
lost
their
interests.
there's
a
number--
mr.
richard
m.
bendix,
jr.
--i
think
that's
what
they've
tried
to
characterize
it
as.
and...
and
it's...
it's
important
to
remember,
as
i
think
justice
scalia
mentioned
in
the
earlier
colloquy,
that
the
property...
in
order
to
run
afoul
of
the
statute,
you
have
to
receive
property,
you
have
to
receive
it
on
account--
mr.
richard
m.
bendix,
jr.
--the...
the
exclusive
right
to
file
a
plan
and
to
be
designated
as
a
potential
funder
of
the
plan
is
certainly
valuable.
it's
not
something
that
was...
it
was
not
property
that
was
distributed
under
the
plan
as
confirmed.
there
is
this--
mr.
richard
m.
bendix,
jr.
--it's...
it's
right
in
section
1129(b)(2)(b)(ii).
mr.
richard
m.
bendix,
jr.
bear
with
me
one
second.
mr.
richard
m.
bendix,
jr.
but
the
earlier--
mr.
richard
m.
bendix,
jr.
--let
me
just
read...
let
me
read
the
language.
it
says:
for
purposes
of
this
subsection,
the
condition
that
a
plan
be
fair
and
equitable
with
res--
mr.
richard
m.
bendix,
jr.
--i'm
reading
from--
mr.
richard
m.
bendix,
jr.
--(b)(2)(b)(ii).
it
says:
the
holder
of
any
claim
or
interest
that
is
junior
to
the
claims
of
such
class
will
not
receive
or
retain
under...
under
the
plan,
on
account
of
such
junior
claim
or
interest,
any
property.
we
read
that
to
mean...
that
phrase,
"under
the
plan"...
to
mean
under
the
plan
as
confirmed.
mr.
richard
m.
bendix,
jr.
no,
your
honor.
we're
saying
that
we
received
an
equity
interest
under
the
plan
and
not
any
option
to
purchase
equity.
mr.
richard
m.
bendix,
jr.
but
that's
really
not
what...
that's
not
an
opportunity.
that
is...
once
the
plan
is
confirmed,
that's
what
you
bought.
i
guess
you
could
say
that--
mr.
richard
m.
bendix,
jr.
--actually,
not,
your
honor.
under
the
plan,
there
is
an
obligation...
there's
a
binding
obligation
to
put
the
money
in.
it's
not
an
opportunity.
thank
you
very
much.
