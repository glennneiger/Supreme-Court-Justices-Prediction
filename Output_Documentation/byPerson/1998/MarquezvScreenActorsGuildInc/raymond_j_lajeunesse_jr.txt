mr.
raymond
j.
lajeunesse,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court--
this
case
presents
three
issues
under
the
national
labor
relations
act.
first,
does
a
union
breach
its
duty
of
fair
representation
by
negotiating
a
contract
that
falsely
tells
employees
they
must
be
union
members
and
pay
full
dues
to
keep
their
jobs
when
this
court
has
held,
and
the
union
concedes,
that
neither
of
those
requirements
may
lawfully
be
enforced?
the
second
question
is
whether
the
national
labor
relations
board
has
exclusive
jurisdiction
over
a
performer's
claim
that
the
screen
actors
guild,
or
sag,
breached
its
duty
of
fair
representation
by
negotiating
a
contract
that
misinforms
performers
who
have
been
employed
in
the
motion
picture
industry
for
30
days
or
more
that
they
must
meet
their
union
obligations
under
a
union
security
clause
immediately
upon
hire
by
any
employer
in
that
industry.
and
third,
is
the
employer
a
necessary
party
in
this
case
because
the
plaintiff
employee
is
seeking
reformation
of
the
misleading
contract
provisions?
i
will
submit
the
last
issue
on
the
briefs
today
and
only
address
the
first
two
issues,
because
neither
the
union
nor
the
employer
has
opposed
our
arguments
on
the
third
issue.
of
course,
i'll
be
glad
to
answer
any
questions
that
the
court
has
throughout
any
of
the
three
issues.
the
first
question
is
whether
this
contract
breaches
the
duty
of
fair
representation
on
its
face,
because
it
says
that
more
is
required
of
employees
as
a
condition
of
employment
than
can
lawfully
be
required.
mr.
raymond
j.
lajeunesse,
jr.
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
it
was--
mr.
raymond
j.
lajeunesse,
jr.
--that's
my
point,
your
honor.
this
court--
mr.
raymond
j.
lajeunesse,
jr.
--to
put
it
simply,
your
honor,
the
employee
is
not
a
lawyer.
a
lawyer
can
be
expected
to
determine
what
the
judicial
gloss
on
the
statute
is,
but--
mr.
raymond
j.
lajeunesse,
jr.
--no,
your
honor.
mr.
raymond
j.
lajeunesse,
jr.
we
draw
the
line
at
the
union
security
clause,
because
that
is
the
only
provision
of
the
contract
as
to
which
the
interests
of
the
individual
employee
are
adverse,
and
as
to
which
the
union
has
a
duty
to
inform
employees
truthfully
and
fully
as
to
what
their
rights
and
obligations
are.
mr.
raymond
j.
lajeunesse,
jr.
i
don't
believe
so,
justice
souter,
because
the
contract
is
the
basic
law
of
the
shop.
mr.
raymond
j.
lajeunesse,
jr.
i
don't
believe
that
i'm
arguing
for
a
formality,
your
honor.
i
believe
that,
as
this
court
held
in
beck
and
has
held
in
other
cases,
the
union
has
a
duty
to
act
fairly
with
regard
to
all
employees
in
the
bargaining
unit
both
in
negotiating
the
contract
and
in
enforcing
it
and--
mr.
raymond
j.
lajeunesse,
jr.
--there
are
two
points
to
your
question,
your
honor.
first,
you
say
that
the
national
labor
relations
board
hasn't
replaced
it.
it's
true
that
the
board
hasn't
replaced
it,
but
in
electronic
worker's
local
444
in
1993,
more
than
a
year
before
sag
negotiated
this
contract
with
this
employer,
the
board
overruled
the
keystone
coat
clause,
saying
that
it
was,
in
fact,
ambiguous
and
would
have
the
effect
of
misleading
employees.
and
secondly,
with
regard
to
the
statute
itself,
the
statute
is
not
just
what
the
statute
says,
after
this
court
has
authoritatively
interpreted
it
and
placed
a
judicial
gloss
on
it,
which
as
judge
posner
and
the
seventh
circuit
said
actually
inverted
the
meaning
of
the
statute.
the
employee
isn't
going
to
know
what
that
statute
means.
the
contract
would
say--
mr.
raymond
j.
lajeunesse,
jr.
--go
read
the
statute,
and
they'd
still
be
misled.
mr.
raymond
j.
lajeunesse,
jr.
well,
she
was
injured
because
the
casting
agent
in
this
case
enforced
the
contract
as
it
was
written,
saying,
you
are
not
going
to
work
tomorrow
if
you
don't
pay
the
full
amount
demanded
by
the
union
by
5:00
this
afternoon.
mr.
raymond
j.
lajeunesse,
jr.
well,
there
are
two
answers
to
that
question,
your
honor.
number
1,
under
this
court's
hudson
decision
the
union
would
have
had
to
give
her
notice
of
the
reduced
amount
and
an
opportunity
to
object
to
its
calculation,
which
would
have
been
some
period
of
time,
typically
30
days.
by
that
time
she
would
have
done
the
job
and
she
would
have
been
paid
by
the
employer,
and
then
she
could
have
paid
the
union.
in
fact,
she
was
willing,
as
she
testified,
i
believe
at
her
deposition,
that
she
would
have
signed
an
agreement--
mr.
raymond
j.
lajeunesse,
jr.
--correct,
your
honor.
that's
the
first
answer.
and
the
second
answer
is
that
this
contract
is
in
a...
as
the
union
makes
a
big
point
of
in
its
brief,
in
a
standard
form
contract
that
it
uses
with
all
employers,
so
marquez
is
going
to
face
this
problem
every
time
she
goes
to
audition
for
a
new
job
on
a
sag
covered
production,
and
she--
mr.
raymond
j.
lajeunesse,
jr.
--well,
it's
because
of
all
of
the
problems,
your
honor.
she
shouldn't
have
to
retain
an
attorney
every
time
she
goes
to
an
audition.
mr.
raymond
j.
lajeunesse,
jr.
well,
if
you
focus
only
on
the
beck
problem,
but
if
you
look
at
all
of
the
aspects
in
which--
mr.
raymond
j.
lajeunesse,
jr.
--well,
i
think
i...
i
thought
i
answered
the
question,
that
the
time
lag--
mr.
raymond
j.
lajeunesse,
jr.
--that
she
would
have
been
allowed
under
this
court's
decision
in
hudson
to
challenge
that
calculation
would
have
given
her
time
to
do
the
job.
mr.
raymond
j.
lajeunesse,
jr.
well,
i
suspect--
mr.
raymond
j.
lajeunesse,
jr.
--no.
i
suspect
that,
your
honor--
mr.
raymond
j.
lajeunesse,
jr.
--by
this
point,
when
the
union
was...
whether...
as
you
know,
there
is
a
question
in
the
record
as
to
whether
the
union...
ninth
circuit
remanded
for
the
district
court
to
determine
a
disputed
issue
of
fact
as
to
whether
the
union
was,
in
fact,
demanding
full
membership,
but
there's
no
dispute
over
the
fact
that
they
were
demanding
payment
of
full
dues
without
saying
she
had
a
right
to--
mr.
raymond
j.
lajeunesse,
jr.
--a
reduced
amount
under
beck.
mr.
raymond
j.
lajeunesse,
jr.
well,
i
believe
she
has--
mr.
raymond
j.
lajeunesse,
jr.
--well,
your
honor,
i
believe
she
does
have
standing
to
challenge
this
misleading
language,
because
that
contract
is
going
to
be
there,
facing
her
every
time
she
goes
to
audition
on
a
new
sag
covered
job,
and
the
duty
of
fair
representation,
it
seems
to
me,
is
not
met
where
an
employee
has--
mr.
raymond
j.
lajeunesse,
jr.
--correct,
your
honor.
mr.
raymond
j.
lajeunesse,
jr.
the
employee...
the
duty
of
fair
representation
is
not
met
where
the
employee
has
to
hire
an
attorney
to
try
to
convince
casting
agents
who
are
reading
the
language
of
the
contract
that
they
should
apply
the
judicial
gloss
and
not
the
actual
terms
of
the
contract.
mr.
raymond
j.
lajeunesse,
jr.
she
knows
now,
your
honor,
but
the
casting
agents
at
the
point
of
hire
who
make
these
decisions
to
hire
or
fire
don't
know
and
they,
like
the
casting
agent
in
this
case,
look
to
the
language
of
the
contract.
when
ms.
marquez'
talent
agent
on
the
day
before
the
job
was
to
be
performed
talked
to
the
casting
agents,
said,
we
have
consulting
an
attorney,
you
are
demanding
more
than
the
law
allows,
the
answer
from
the
casting
agent
was,
we
have
a
union
contract,
we
have
to
apply
that
contract
as
written,
if
she
doesn't
pay--
mr.
raymond
j.
lajeunesse,
jr.
--no,
i--
mr.
raymond
j.
lajeunesse,
jr.
--i'm
not
sure
i
understand
your
question,
your
honor.
what
i'm
asking
this
court
to
do
is
say
that
the
judicial
gloss
should
be
in
the
contracts--
mr.
raymond
j.
lajeunesse,
jr.
--as
well
as
in
the
statements
that
the
union
makes
outside
the
contract.
mr.
raymond
j.
lajeunesse,
jr.
as
to
the
parties
to
the
contract--
mr.
raymond
j.
lajeunesse,
jr.
--justice
stevens,
but
not
as
to
the
man
in
the
street,
the
average
employee
in
the
shop,
the
average
shop
steward--
mr.
raymond
j.
lajeunesse,
jr.
--they
have
an
affirmative
duty
to
explain
it.
you
don't
have
to
ask
a
question.
the
employee
doesn't
have
to
ask
the
question
to
trigger
the
duty
of
fair
representation.
mr.
raymond
j.
lajeunesse,
jr.
the
duty
of
fair
representation
is
a
positive
one
that
the
union
has
to
perform
even
if
the
employee
might
fortuitously
discover
what
their
rights
really
are
from
some
other
source.
mr.
raymond
j.
lajeunesse,
jr.
i
think
it's
clear
from
this
case
and
from
other
cases
that
the
fact
that
the
misleading
in
the
contract
does
result
in
people
being
affirmatively
misled.
mr.
raymond
j.
lajeunesse,
jr.
buzenius--
mr.
raymond
j.
lajeunesse,
jr.
--well,
in
other
cases
it's
been
by
the
union
officials.
in,
for
example,
the
buzenius
and
the
bloom
cases
where--
mr.
raymond
j.
lajeunesse,
jr.
--but
they
knew
when
they
copied
the
language
of
the
contract...
of
the
statute
into
the
contract
that
it
could
not
be
enforced
as
written.
what
justification
is
there
for
not
putting
it
in
the
contract
with
the
judicial
gloss,
which
is
very
simple
to
do?
mr.
raymond
j.
lajeunesse,
jr.
it
will
end...
it
will
end
with
the
union
security
clause,
your
honor,
because
that's
the
only
case
in
which
the
union
has
a
self
interest
in
misleading
employees.
all
other
aspects
of
the
contract
are
cases
where
the
interests
of
the
union
and
the
employees
are
coincident.
here
they
are
contrary.
mr.
raymond
j.
lajeunesse,
jr.
well,
i
had
two
answers
to
justice
o'connor's
question.
one
was
the
fact
that,
as
justice
scalia
described,
the
bureaucratic--
mr.
raymond
j.
lajeunesse,
jr.
--lag
would
have
given
her
an
opportunity
to
earn
the
money
to
be
able
to
pay
the
reduced--
mr.
raymond
j.
lajeunesse,
jr.
--my
second
point
was
that
this
is
a
contract
provision
that
ms.
marquez
has
to
face
every
time
she
auditions
for
a
job
on
a
sag
covered
production.
mr.
raymond
j.
lajeunesse,
jr.
no,
but
we...
justice
scalia,
we
can
count
on
the
fact
that
the
likelihood
is
there
that
casting
agents
will
continue
to
rely
on
the
misleading
language
of
the
contract
because
they
do
not
know
the
judicial
gloss.
mr.
raymond
j.
lajeunesse,
jr.
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
raymond
j.
lajeunesse,
jr.
well,
we
did--
mr.
raymond
j.
lajeunesse,
jr.
--well,
we
did
bring
that
case,
your
honor,
and
the
ninth
circuit
sent
that
back
to
the
district
court
for
the
district
court
to
determine
whether
the
union
failed
in
its
duty,
in
its
statements
outside
the
collective
bargaining
contract.
mr.
raymond
j.
lajeunesse,
jr.
the
case
here
is
whether...
the
facial
language
of
the
contract.
mr.
raymond
j.
lajeunesse,
jr.
we
can't
make
that
assumption,
but
we
know--
mr.
raymond
j.
lajeunesse,
jr.
--but
i
have
to
return
to
what
this
court
held
in
beck,
and
that
is
that
the
union
has
a
duty
of
fair
representation
both
in
negotiating
and
enforcing
the
union
security
clauses
to
ensure
that
employees
are
not
misled
as
to
their
rights.
and
what
possible
justification
is
there
for
negotiating
a
contract
that
states
the
bare,
misleading
language
of
a
statute
when
there
is
a
easily
described
judicial
gloss
out
there
that
could
be
put
in
the
contract
and
avoid
all
of
these
problems.
mr.
raymond
j.
lajeunesse,
jr.
well,
i
don't...
that's
an
assumption
i
think
we
cannot
make
on
this
record,
your
honor.
i...
i--
mr.
raymond
j.
lajeunesse,
jr.
--no.
the
allegation
is
that
she
was
not
informed
what
her
rights
were.
she
found
out--
mr.
raymond
j.
lajeunesse,
jr.
--no,
she
didn't
already
know,
your
honor.
she
found
out
fortuitously
because
her
talent
agent
had
had
a
problem
in
the
past
and
referred
her
to
an
attorney
because
the
talent
agent
thought
there
was
a
problem
here.
but
the
duty
of
fair
representation
surely
does
not
put
the
onus
on
the
employee.
it
puts
it
on
the
union.
mr.
raymond
j.
lajeunesse,
jr.
well,
that
defense
was
raised
by
the
union
in
beck,
your
honor,
and
this
court
said
in
beck
that
the
union,
in
negotiating
the
contract
or
enforcing
it,
had
breached
the
duty
of
fair
representation
by
requiring
more
than
is
permitted
by
section
8(a)(3),
and
that
because
it's
a
duty
of
fair
representation
claim,
it
belongs
in
court.
it
is
not
preempted.
now,
the
ninth
circuit
recognized
that
with
regard
to
the
claim
that
what...
that
the
union
misrepresented
what
ms.
marquez'
obligations
were
and
litigated
that
and
decided
that
issue,
and
it's
now
before
this
court.
the
ninth
circuit,
however,
said
that
the
claim
with
regard
to
the
30
day
employment
in
the
industry
clause
was
preempted
and
subject
to
the
board's
exclusive
jurisdiction.
there
is
no
logical
reason,
as
chief
judge
posner
of
the
seventh
circuit
held
in
wegscheid,
for
distinguishing
between
statements
in
the
agreement
and
statements
outside
the
agreement.
mr.
raymond
j.
lajeunesse,
jr.
i
don't--
mr.
raymond
j.
lajeunesse,
jr.
--i
see
the
problem
you're
posing--
mr.
raymond
j.
lajeunesse,
jr.
--but
i
think
the
problem
is
not
as
great
as
you
believe
it
is,
your
honor.
the...
there
is
no
problem,
because
the
court
so
held
in
beck,
and
the
union
concedes
this,
that
where...
in
its
brief
on
page
43,
i
believe
it
is,
that...
i
think
it's
page
43.
yes,
it
is...
that
the
duty
of
fair
representation
is
breached
when
the
union
misleads
employees
about
their
rights
under
a
union
security
clause.
mr.
raymond
j.
lajeunesse,
jr.
and
they
argue,
well,
if
the
employee
is
misled
about
what
their
obligations
are,
that's
a
breach
of
the
duty
of
fair
representation
and
properly
belongs
in
court,
but
somehow,
if
the
union
misleads
the
employee
about
when
their
obligations
begin,
that's
not
a
breach--
mr.
raymond
j.
lajeunesse,
jr.
--well,
our
claim
was,
stated
in
the
complaint,
stated
in
our
motion
for
summary
judgment,
argued
in
the
ninth
circuit,
that
the
union
breached
the
duty
of
fair
representation
by
misrepresenting
when
her
obligations
lawfully
began.
mr.
raymond
j.
lajeunesse,
jr.
it
was
a
claim--
mr.
raymond
j.
lajeunesse,
jr.
--right,
because
the--
mr.
raymond
j.
lajeunesse,
jr.
--well,
so
is
there
under
beck.
it's...
there's
a
clear
violation
of
the
statute--
mr.
raymond
j.
lajeunesse,
jr.
--well,
the
courts
and
the
board.
mr.
raymond
j.
lajeunesse,
jr.
both
have
jurisdiction.
mr.
raymond
j.
lajeunesse,
jr.
the
ninth
circuit
thought
no
with
regard
to
the
question
of,
did
the
union
mislead
her
as
to
when
her
obligations
began,
but
it
said
yes
as
to
what
her
obligations
are,
and
i
don't
see
any
logical
distinction
between
the
two
claims.
either
both
should
be
before
the
board,
or
both
should
be
before
the
courts
under
the
duty
of
fair
representation,
and
this
court
has
already
held
in
beck
that
claims
concerning
the
what
can
be
brought
in
court
and
are
not
subject
to
the
board's
exclusive
jurisdiction.
there's
no
reason,
as
the
seventh
circuit
said,
to
distinguish
between
claims
of
misrepresentation
outside
the
contract
and
those
inside
the
contract.
in
fact,
here,
the
court
below
determined
the
question
of
misrepresentation
within
the
contract
with
regard
to
the
what,
but
not
the
when,
and
there--
mr.
raymond
j.
lajeunesse,
jr.
--well,
it
was
also
in
beck
an
argument
over
what
does
section
8(a)(3)
provide,
and
the
court
said
that
the
employee
was
stating
a
claim
for
breach
of
duty
of
fair
representation,
and
you
have--
mr.
raymond
j.
lajeunesse,
jr.
--i
don't
think
you
can--
mr.
raymond
j.
lajeunesse,
jr.
--you
can't
turn
most
of
them
into
breaches
of
the
duty
of
fair
representation,
but
you
can
in
the
context
of
the
union
security
clause
because
of
this
affirmative
duty
the
union
has
of
informing
employees
truthfully
and
honestly
of
what
their
rights
and
obligations
are.
mr.
raymond
j.
lajeunesse,
jr.
i
don't
follow
your
question,
justice
scalia.
mr.
raymond
j.
lajeunesse,
jr.
your
honor,
i
have
to
look
at
the
specifics
of
a
particular
claim.
mr.
raymond
j.
lajeunesse,
jr.
but
i--
mr.
raymond
j.
lajeunesse,
jr.
--the
only
duties
that
the
union
has
toward
the
nonmembers
are
the
duty...
or,
is
the
duty
of
fair
representation.
that's
why
i
don't
know
how
you
get
outside
that.
the
union
has
an
obligation
to
represent
the--
mr.
raymond
j.
lajeunesse,
jr.
--and
if
in
performing
those
duties
the
union
acts
arbitrarily,
discriminatorily,
or
in
bad
faith--
mr.
raymond
j.
lajeunesse,
jr.
--then
it
has...
there
is
a
claim
for
a
breach
of
duty
of
fair
representation,
and--
mr.
raymond
j.
lajeunesse,
jr.
--and
that's
what
this
court
has
held,
and
it's
justiciable
in
court,
and
not
preempted
by
the
board's
exclusive
jurisdiction.
i
see
my
time
has
expired.
thank
you,
your
honor.
