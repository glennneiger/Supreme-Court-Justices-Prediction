unknown
speaker
well,
the
contract
was
written
in
the
language
of
the
statute,
i
gather.
unknown
speaker
and
the
statute
doesn't
make
it
all
that
clear
itself,
but
i
guess
there's
a
judicial
gloss
on
it.
unknown
speaker
and
why
shouldn't
the
employee
assume
the
judicial
gloss
is
there?
i
mean,
why
does
it
have
to
be
spelled
out
in
the
contract?
unknown
speaker
what
other
portions
of
the
contract
that
are
very
intricate
have
to
be
spelled
out
for
the
employee?
i
mean,
is
that
the
obligation
of
the
union,
to
make
every
provision
of
a
contract
that
affects
the
employee
clear
to
the
employee?
my
goodness.
unknown
speaker
well,
where
do
we
draw
the
line?
unknown
speaker
well...
go
on.
no--
--go
on--
--but
isn't
the
fact
that
the
union
can
do
so
other
than
by
putting
an
express
gloss
on
the
contract
language,
or
changing
the
language
of
the
contract,
a
sufficient
response
to
the
problem
that
you
raise?
unknown
speaker
no,
but
the
fact
is,
the
employee
is
quite
un...
is
far
less
likely
to
read
the
contract
than
to
have
contact
with
union
representatives,
who
have,
as
you
acknowledge,
an
obligation
to
explain,
in
fact,
what
those
terms
mean
and
what
the
employee's
real
obligation
is,
so
it
seems
to
me
that
you're
arguing
for
a
formality
which
the
average
employee
is
likely,
unlikely
even
to
take
notice
of.
unknown
speaker
what
does
that
say
with
negotiating
the
contract?
i
wasn't
aware
that
beck...
if
beck
said
that
there
has
to
be
in
the
contract
this
clause
that
you're
urging
there
would
be
nothing
to
argue
about,
but
my
understanding
is
that
the
contract
not
only
reflects
the
language
of
the
statute
but
the
nlrb's...
what
it
was...
is
it
keystone
coat,
or
whatever
it
is,
their
model
clause.
and
the
nlrb
still
hasn't
gotten
around
to
replacing
that
model
clause,
so
whatever
else
this
is,
how
can
it
be
a
violation
of
the
duty
of
fair
representation
to
keep
in
the
contract
what
the
nlrb
and
the
statute
say
is
okay,
as
long
as
the
union
notifies
anyone
who
doesn't
want
to
be
a
member
that,
right,
you
don't
have
to
be
a
member?
unknown
speaker
well,
mr.
lajeunesse--
unknown
speaker
--suppose...
suppose
the
contract
had
been
written
with
all
the
complicated
things
you
want
in
there,
so
that
she
would
have
had
to
come
up
with,
what,
$485
instead
of
$500
to
join
the
union,
she
still
wouldn't
have
gotten
the
job,
because
she
didn't
have
the
money.
how
was
she
injured
by
the
contract?
unknown
speaker
yes,
the
point
is,
i
guess...
you
say
the
correct
amount
would
have
ben
$485
instead
of
$500
and
the
contract
could
have
made
that
clear,
but
she
didn't
have
$485
either,
so
she
still
wouldn't
have
gotten
the
job.
how
did
the
contract
hurt
her,
even
if
it
had
been
written
as
you
want
it
written?
unknown
speaker
regulatory
lag
would
have
saved
her.
is
that--
unknown
speaker
--yes,
but
that's
because
of
the
30
day
problem,
not
because
of
the
beck
problem.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
think
justice
o'connor's
question
was
addressed
to
the
beck
problem
and
saying,
given
the
fact
that
she
could
not,
in
fact,
have
satisfied
the
obligation
even
if
beck
had
been
applied
in
the
drafting
of
the
contract,
as
you
say
it
should
be,
where
is
her
harm?
i
think
it
was
a
beck
question.
unknown
speaker
well,
let's
focus
on
the
beck
problem,
which
is
what
i
tried
to
get
you
to
do
but
failed.
unknown
speaker
i
didn't
understand
it.
unknown
speaker
she
wouldn't
have
challenged
it
unless
she
had
reason
to
challenge
it,
i
assume.
you
mean,
she
would
have
routinely
challenged
it,
just
for
the
heck
of
it,
just...
i
mean--
unknown
speaker
--gaming
the
system
that
way?
unknown
speaker
surely
she
wouldn't
have
done
that.
unknown
speaker
it
doesn't
matter.
unknown
speaker
but
she
couldn't
afford
$485
any
more
than
she
could
afford
$500
i
don't
see
how
she's
hurt,
and
i
don't
think
it's
enough
to
say,
well,
she
might
have
protested
it
and
bought
herself
a
month.
well,
she
might
have.
she
might
not
have.
unknown
speaker
i
mean,
it
seems
to
me
it's
your
burden
to
show
standing.
unknown
speaker
capable
of
repetition
and--
unknown
speaker
--okay.
unknown
speaker
i
don't
understand
the
capable
of
repetition.
she
knows
now
because
you've
talked
to
her
and
she's
read
the
briefs.
unknown
speaker
we
thought
that
language
fairly
meant
what
beck
said.
how
can
we
criticize
the
union
for
including
the
same
language?
i
mean,
it's
sort
of
a
dog
in
the
manger
thing
for
us
to
do.
it
was
we
who
said
that
the
language
means
this
thing.
now
you
want
us
to
say
no,
the
language
doesn't
mean
this
thing,
and
you
should
have
explained
what
it
really
means.
unknown
speaker
i
mean,
maybe
you
should
ask
some
other
court
to
do
that,
but
this
court--
[laughter]
this
court
says
that
language
means
this,
and
you
now
want
us
to
say
no,
this
language
really
doesn't
mean
this,
and
you
should
have
explained
what
it
does
mean.
unknown
speaker
why?
mr....
mr.--
unknown
speaker
--but
the
fact
that
it's
judicial
gloss
means
that
it
is
in
the
contract.
that's
what
the
judicial
gloss
is.
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
but
is
there
any
allegation
that
anybody
misled
her
as
to
what
it
meant?
i
mean,
did
the
union
ever
refuse
to
explain
this,
or
anything
like
that?
unknown
speaker
but
did
she--
unknown
speaker
--the
notice
question--
--but
where
would
they
have...
well--
--is
a
different
one,
isn't
it?
the
question
of...
and
there's
been
a
lot
of
litigation
on
that,
too,
and
there's
no
doubt
that
the
union
has
to
give
fair
notice
and
an
opportunity
to
do
all
that.
so
i
go
back
to
the
question
that
was
raised
earlier.
is
this
all
the
most
formal
objection?
i
mean,
everybody
agrees
on
the
substance
of
the
union's
obligation.
it
must
notify
workers
that
they
don't
have
to
join
the
union
and
they
have
to
pay
only
for
collective
bargaining
related
things.
everybody
agrees
that's
the
obligation.
the
only
question
is,
must
they
put
it
in
the
contract,
and
i
think
we
can
all
agree
that
most
people
don't
read
the
collective
bargaining
contracts,
but
they
will
read
the
union's
newsletter
that
will
say
it
ought
to
pay
the
full
dues.
unknown
speaker
well,
but--
unknown
speaker
--by
the
union,
or
by
here...
you
said
it
was
the
person
at
the
employer's
place.
unknown
speaker
but
here
there
was
nothing...
the
only
thing
that
you
allege
that
the
union
did
is,
it
copied
the
statute
into
the
contract.
you
don't
allege
any
misleading
on
the
part
of
the
union.
unknown
speaker
the
where
will
it
end...
the
where
will
it
end
argument
is
a
persuasive
one
for
me.
if
i
start
having
to
interpret
everything
in
the
contract
so
that
a
nonlawyer
can
figure
out
what
it
means,
you
know,
i'll
be
here
all
night.
what
will
happen
to
the
legal
profession.
the--
unknown
speaker
--it
might...
i
think
this
principle
that
you
should
write
all
these
things
so
that
people
who
aren't
lawyers
can
understand
them
may
be
a
helpful
principle,
but
i
think
it
might
be
precatory.
it
might
not
be
the
law,
all
right.
if
i
think
that,
so
that
you
still
can
have
terms
of
arts
in
contracts,
i'm
still
stopped
by
justice
o'connor's
question,
and
i
want
to
be
absolutely
clear,
because
it
sounds
to
me
as
if
your
answer
is,
there
is
no
answer.
now,
i
take
it
her
question
was,
how
was
mrs.
marquez
hurt,
and
as
far
as
i
could
tell,
looking
through
this,
you
have
lots
of
testimony
that
the
reason
that
she
couldn't
join
in
any
forum
is
she
didn't
have
the
$500.
you
also
have
testimony
in
the
record
that
her
agents
fully
understood
that.
they
understood
the
difference
between
core
membership
and
noncore
membership,
and
you
have
no
evidence
in
the
record
to
the
contrary.
now,
if
that's
the
state
of
the
record,
then
how
could
anybody
say
that
this
particular
argument
you're
making,
the
fact
that
she'd
have
to
pay
$500,
or
$480
rather
than
$500,
is
an
interesting
argument,
but
really
has
nothing
to
do
with
this
case
as
far
as
mrs.
marquez.
i
take
it
that
was
justice
o'connor's
question.
i'm
just
being
repetitive,
but
i
want
to
be
absolutely
certain
that
there
is
no
answer
to
it
before
i
think
that
that's
what
you've
said.
unknown
speaker
lag.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
know...
i...
yes.
unknown
speaker
we
can
count
on
the
fact
that
she's
going
to
be
without
500
bucks
for
the
rest
of
her
life?
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
no,
but
you
have
said...
i
think
you
have
said
in
the
course
of
your
argument
that
the
union
failed
in
the
responsibility
which
you've
characterized
as
an
affirmative
responsibility
to
advise
her
about
what
her
rights
were.
you
did
say
that,
didn't
you?
unknown
speaker
okay.
number
1,
you
could
have
raised
that
as
an
allegation
and
we'd
have
a
very
different
case
here,
wouldn't
we?
we
wouldn't
be
worrying
about
the
contract
language.
we
would
be
worrying
about
the
union's
failure
to
perform
the
obligation
that
you
say
it
has.
unknown
speaker
so
you
could
have
brought
a
different
case,
couldn't
you?
unknown
speaker
okay.
so
that--
unknown
speaker
--that
may
be
your
avenue,
but
doesn't
it
also
point
to
the
problem...
to
the...
your
answer
to
the
standing
problem,
and
that
is,
you
said
to
justice
scalia,
every
time
she
looks
for
a
job
the
casting
agent
is
going
to
hold
up
this
contract.
but
that
assumes
that
the
union
is
going,
every
time
when
she
inquires,
to
fail
to
tell
her
what
she
really
has
to
do,
i.e.,
tell
her
that
she
can
get
by
with
$480
rather
than
$500,
and
we
can't
make
that
assumption,
can
we?
unknown
speaker
no,
but
what
you're
saying
what's
wrong
here
is
that
the
casting
agent
is
going
to
give
her
the
wrong
information.
it's
going
to
say,
you're
obligated
to
become
a
full
member,
and
the
answer
to
that
is,
the
union
has
an
affirmative
obligation
to
tell
her
that
she
doesn't
have
to
do
that,
so
that
isn't
the
answer
to
your
answer
to
justice
scalia
simply
the
recognition
that
the
union
presumably,
in
the
absence
of
evidence
to
the
contrary,
will
not
refuse
every
single
time
to
fulfill
its
obligation?
or
she
could
just
read
the
pleadings
in
this
lawsuit.
do
those--
unknown
speaker
--well,
as
to
the
future--
--well,
may
i
ask--
--the
justification
is
that,
a)
she
knows
what
the
judicial
gloss
is,
and
b)
there's
no
indication
that
the
union
won't
give
the
same
information
to
the
casting
agent,
so
it's
not
likely
to
recur.
unknown
speaker
well,
is
there
an
affirmative
allegation
on
her
part
that
she
did
not
know
what
the
contract
meant?
unknown
speaker
but
maybe
she
didn't
have
to
be,
because
she
already
knew,
as
far
as
the--
unknown
speaker
--mr.
lajeunesse,
i've
got
a
question
about,
this
duty
of
fair
representation
starts
out
as
a
rather
heavy
concept,
race
discrimination
by
the
union,
and
now
we're
talking
about
what
has
to
be
in
the
contract
as
opposed
to
the
substance
of
the
allegation
we
know,
and
it
seems
to
me
to
say
this
is
a
question
of
violation
of
a
duty
of
fair
representation.
instead
of
saying,
this
is
arguably
an
unfair
labor
practice,
it
should
be...
go
to
the
board
and
then
be
reviewed
by
the
courts,
instead
of
rushing
into
court
with,
this
is
the
union's
really
bad
act,
it
violated
the
duty
of
fair
representation,
when
it's...
when
the
piece
of
this
that
we're
concerned
with
is
just
what's
in
the
contract,
not
conduct,
deceptive
conduct
by
the
union,
just
what's
in
the
contract.
unknown
speaker
it's...
that's
exactly...
just
what
justice
ginsburg
asked
is
what
i
find
a
very
difficult
question,
and
why
i'm...
that's
just
what
you're
about...
let
me
flag
specifically
the
language
in
beck.
just
after
the
sentence
you
said,
they
go
on
to
say,
employees,
of
course,
may
not
circumvent
the
primary
jurisdiction
of
the
nlrb
simply
by
casting
statutory
claims
as
violations
of
the
union's
duty
of
fair
representation.
and
what
i
was
having
difficulty
with
in
thinking
of
that
second
issue
in
this
case
is,
how
do
you
distinguish
where
that
sentence
does
or
doesn't
apply?
i
mean,
after
all,
any
claim
that
the
union
has
violated
the
labor
act,
you
could
find
some
employee
to
go
in
and
say,
they
violated
the
labor
act
and,
moreover,
it
violates
the
duty
of
unfair
representation.
there
would
be
no
primary
jurisdiction
left.
unknown
speaker
once
we
accept
that,
then
what
can
the
employee
complain
about?
how
do
we
draw
that
line?
there's
no
brief
here
by
the
board.
i'm
having
trouble
understanding
how
to
draw
that
line
between
when
you
can
and
when
you
cannot,
as
an
employee,
assert
in
an
unfair
labor...
you
see
the
problem?
unknown
speaker
all
right.
what's
the
answer?
thank
you.
unknown
speaker
i'm
talking...
i'm
thinking
about
the
30
day
problem.
unknown
speaker
no,
no,
it
wasn't
misleading.
i'm
thinking
of
the
particular
claim,
too,
which
i
thought
was
not
a
claim
of
misleading,
but
rather
the
claim
that
you
have
to
join
after
30
days
cannot
be
interpreted
by
the
guild
as
a
claim
that
you
have
to
join
after
30
days
of
work
in
the
screen
industry
even
if
those
30
days
took
place
over
a
2
year
period
for
30
different
employers.
now,
i
think
your
claim
there
was
that
that
violates
the
language,
or
the...
violates
8(a)(3).
unknown
speaker
well,
the--
unknown
speaker
--the
contract
refers
to
employment
in
the
industry,
and
you
say
the
statute
makes
it
clear
it's
employment
for
that
employer.
unknown
speaker
so
that
you
say,
as
to
the
30
day
thing,
there
was
a
clear
violation
of
the
statutory
requirement.
unknown
speaker
well,
we've
dealt
with
that.
let's
not
get
back
into
beck.
let's
talk
about
the
30
day.
now,
as
to
the
30
day
thing,
who
has
jurisdiction
to
decide
that?
unknown
speaker
you
think
both.
unknown
speaker
and
the
ninth
circuit
thought
no,
that
it
was
primary
jurisdiction
of
the
board,
i--
unknown
speaker
--why
isn't
the
when
just
a
question
of
incorrect
interpretation
of
the
legal
requirement?
there's
an
argument
that
the
law
means
30
days,
particular
employer,
30
days
in
the
industry.
that's
an
argument
about
what
the
legal
requirement
is.
why
does
that
also
become
a
violation
of
the
duty
of
fair
representation?
unknown
speaker
well,
the
question
is,
what
can
you
turn...
what
unfair
labor
practice
can't
you
turn
into
violation
of
the
duty
of
fair
representation,
and
it's--
unknown
speaker
--hard
for
me
to
see
what
the
line
is
between
them.
unknown
speaker
any...
let
me
sort
of
restate
justice
ginsburg's
question
a
little
more
narrowly.
can
you
tell
us
any
statutory
obligations
of
the
union
with
regard
to
employees
as
opposed
to
rights
and
obligations
vis
a
vis
the
employer
that
cannot
be
recast
as
a
breach
of
the
duty
of
fair
representation?
unknown
speaker
can
you
think
of
any
of
the
statutory
obligations
of
the
union
with
respect
to
the
members
of
the
union
that
could
not
be
cast
as
a
claimed
failure
of
the
duty
of
fair
representation?
unknown
speaker
well,
just
give
me
an
example.
unknown
speaker
give
me
an
example
of
one
that
wouldn't
be
a
duty
of...
breach
of
the
duty
of
fair
representation,
obligation
of
the
union
towards
its
members,
or
towards
employees
of
the
employer
under
the
statute,
the
union
violates
it,
and
yet
it
is
not
a
breach
of
the
duty
of
fair
representation.
what...
just
give
me
one
example,
and
i'll
be
happy.
unknown
speaker
oh,
it
has
an
obligation
to
represent
their
causes
fairly,
given
its
other
interests
in
grievances
and
so
forth.
that
would
be
a
duty,
the
violation--
unknown
speaker
--right.
unknown
speaker
so
you
think,
as
i
do,
that
any
breach
of
the
union's
duty
towards
its
members
or
towards
other
employees
of
the
shop
that
it
represents
is
a
breach
of
the
duty
of
fair
representation.
unknown
speaker
thank
you,
mr.
lajeunesse.
mr.
geffner,
we'll
hear
from
you.
unknown
speaker
this
is
after
the
remand
from
the
ninth
circuit?
unknown
speaker
before?
unknown
speaker
that
was
the
case
in
beck?
unknown
speaker
no,
no,
but
i
mean,
you
think
that
that
description
is
a
fair
description
of
what
happened
in
beck?
unknown
speaker
no.
unknown
speaker
that
was
held
to
be
a
breach
of
the
duty
of
the
union's
duty
of
fair
representation.
unknown
speaker
even
when
the
statute
says...
even
when
the
statute
says
you
can
require
people
to
be
members
of
the
union?
unknown
speaker
but
i'm
just
saying--
unknown
speaker
--your
description
of
what
our
case
law
says
is
necessary--
unknown
speaker
--for
a
duty
of...
violation
of
a
duty
of
unfair
representation
is
simply
not
accurate,
when
you...
when
you
take
account
of
beck,
as
you
must.
unknown
speaker
well,
it
didn't
track
the
statute
on
the
30
day
provision,
did
it?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
it's
that
part
of
the
case
that
i'm
finding
the
most
difficult
part,
because
i
don't
know
what
the...
you,
in
your
brief,
take
an
opposite
position,
and
it
seems
like
a
very
important
question,
about
when
and
under
what
circumstances
a
simple
statement
of
a
worker
that
the
union
has
violated
its
duty
of
fair
representation
gets
that
worker
into
court,
where
what
is
alleged
is
that
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
has
a
term
in
it
that
violates
section
8(a)(3).
unknown
speaker
it's
not
a
claim...
it's
saying
that
there...
and
that's
what
they're
arguing
there,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
all
right.
well--
unknown
speaker
--what's
the
standard--
unknown
speaker
--that
seems
to
by
and
large
say
that
the
worker
gets
into
court
simply
by
saying,
violates
the
duty
of
fair
representation,
but
there's
a
sentence
that
i
read
that
suggests
that
under
some
circumstances
you
can't
get
into
court
because
to
do
so
would
destroy
garmon.
it
would
destroy
the
primary
jurisdiction
cases.
now,
what
i'm
lacking
is
the
standard
to
distinguish
the
first
from
the
second.
unknown
speaker
and
it
seems
important...
maybe
it
isn't
for
some
reason,
and
i'm
not
an
expert
in
labor
law.
unknown
speaker
in
beck,
in
that
part
of
beck--
unknown
speaker
--the
lawyer
had
characterized
the
claim--
unknown
speaker
--as
a
violation
of
8(a)(3)
and
fair
labor
practice.
in
this
case,
the
lawyer
has
characterized
the
claim,
though
a
similar
kind
of
claim,
as
a
violation
of
the
duty
of
fair
representation.
unknown
speaker
it
comes
right
into
that
heading
in
the
complaint.
unknown
speaker
that's
why
i'm
asking
you
for
a
standard
that
distinguishes
the
sheep
from
the
goats.
unknown
speaker
are
you
saying--
unknown
speaker
--excuse
me,
mr.
geffner.
are
you
saying
that
the
line
should
be
drawn
depending
on
whether
the
violation
is
clear
or
not?
unknown
speaker
okay,
but
it's
not
clear--
unknown
speaker
--are
you
saying
that
in
cases
in
which
it
is
not
clear,
that's
when
there
is
this
different
jurisdictional
option,
and
they
can
come
into
court
under
unfair
labor?
unknown
speaker
unfair
representation.
unknown
speaker
no,
but
i
don't...
i
want
to
hear
you,
but
i
want
to
stick
to
my
question
for
a
minute.
i
take
it
your
answer
is,
no,
i
am
not
saying
that
we
decide
whether
something
must
be
brought
as
an
unfair
labor
practice
before
the
board
depending
upon
whether
the
statutory
violation
is
clear
or
merely
arguable.
that's
not
to
the
line
that
you're
suggesting.
unknown
speaker
if
you're
not
saying
that,
what
are
you
saying?
yes,
what
is
the
line?
unknown
speaker
well,
but
that
sounds
like
you're
simply
retracting
what
you
said
a
moment
ago.
i
thought
in
answer
to
justice
souter's
question
you
said
the
distinction
was
not
between
whether
the
violation
was
clear
or
not
clear.
now
you're
saying
that
if
it's
clear
it
goes
to
the
board.
unknown
speaker
that
doesn't
make
any
sense.
unknown
speaker
so
lack
of
clarity
has
nothing
to
do
with
it,
is
that
right?
unknown
speaker
how
do
we
know
the
difference?
unknown
speaker
how
can
you...
how
do
we
tell
the
difference
between
the
ones
which
are
cases
for
the
expertise
of
the
board,
and
therefore
must
go
first
to
the
board,
from
ones
that
can
be
brought
into
court?
you
haven't
told
us.
unknown
speaker
well,
could
you
give
a
narrow
standard?
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
make
us
an
offer,
mr.
geffner.
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
but
why
shouldn't
it
be--
unknown
speaker
--on
the
other
question,
too,
why
shouldn't
the
board
say
whether
it
belongs
in
the
contract
as
opposed
to--
unknown
speaker
--suppose,
for
example,
the
board
had
said,
we're
doing
away
with
our
old
learning.
we're
adopting
what
chairman
gould
had
suggested
that
we
adopt
as
the
new
model
clause,
and
then
the
union
doesn't
use
the
new
model
clause,
it
uses
the
one
that
it's
been
using
from
the
beginning
of
the
taft
hartley.
if
that
were
the
case,
then
wouldn't
there
be
a
violation
of
the
duty
of
fair
representation?
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
the
question
could
all...
as
i
understood
mr.
lajeunesse,
there's
no
question
that
the
board
has
jurisdiction.
he's
not
arguing
for
exclusive
court
jurisdiction.
he's
saying
that
they
both
would
have
jurisdiction.
you're
saying
that
at
least
with
respect
to
the
30
days
only
the
board
has
jurisdiction.
unknown
speaker
yes.
with
review--
unknown
speaker
--in
the
court
of
appeals,
not
in
a
district
court.
unknown
speaker
but
i...
the
question
is,
are
they
all
both,
as
justice
scalia
suggested,
whenever
employees
are
affected,
then
it's
a
choice
to
go
directly
to
court,
or
go
to
the
nlrb?
unknown
speaker
mr.
geffner--
unknown
speaker
--could
a
line
be
drawn
this
way,
that
by
recognizing
that
the
decision
in
beck,
the
construction
of
the
statute
that
the
court
announced
in
beck
was
at
least
driven
by
a
concern
over
first
amendment
issues.
and,
therefore,
could
we
say
that
if,
in
fact,
the
argument
that
is
brought
is
an
argument
which
depends...
which
would...
if
it's
a
statutory
interpretation
argument,
that
would
depend
on,
or
turn
on
a
concern
over
constitutional
issues,
perhaps
avoiding
constitutional
issues,
that
that
would
be
an
appropriate
case
to
bring
in
the
first
instance
in
a
court
under
fair
representation
because
that's
not
the
labor
board's
principle
subject
of
expertness,
whereas
if
the
interpretive
issue
does
not
have
constitutional
implications,
you
ought
to
start
with
the
board
under
unfair
labor
practice?
unknown
speaker
is
that
a
way
we
could
draw
the
line?
unknown
speaker
but
then
i
think
you'd
have
mr.
lajeunesse
back
in
court
in
this
case
saying
that
there
are
perhaps
constitutional
implications
here.
now,
perhaps
they
wouldn't
be
very
strong
ones,
but
i
think
that
would
underestimate
the
ability
of
lawyers
to
cast
their
claims--
[laughter]
--in
constitutional
terms.
unknown
speaker
well,
counsel,
the
judge
of
scanlon
didn't
rely
on
the
constitution,
though.
he
seemed
to
draw
a
distinction
between
a
claim
where
the
main
claim
does
not
depend
on
a
violation
of
8(a)(2)
or
8(a)(3)
and
a
claim
that
it
only
collaterally
would
involve--
unknown
speaker
--i
was
going
to
ask
you
if
you
walk
away
from
them
or
you
endorse
the--
unknown
speaker
--so
how
do
you
think
about
it
as
a
labor
lawyer?
i
mean,
i
take
it
this
is
the
only
case
in
which
this
issue
has
arisen.
i
couldn't
find
any
other.
there's
one
case
this
one
way,
and
dictum
by
judge
posner
the
other,
so
we
haven't
had
a
problem
of
labor
lawyers
representing
workers
running
in
and
recharacterizing
nlra
claims
as
unfair
discrimination
claims.
that
hasn't
happened,
so
there
must
be
some
line
in
a
practicing
lawyer's
mind,
otherwise
we
perhaps
face
dozens
of
these
recharacterizations.
unknown
speaker
what
is
it
in
your
mind?
what
is
it
that
leads
you...
i'm
just
still
driving
for
the
standard.
unknown
speaker
you
must
have
one
there
subconsciously.
unknown
speaker
what
if
the
board
had
ruled
on
this
clause,
mr.
geffner?
then
could
an
employer
in
mrs.
marquez'
situation
bring
an
action
in
court?
unknown
speaker
an
employee.
i'm
sorry,
an
employee,
yes.
unknown
speaker
so
if
the
board's
ruled
on
it
you
have
to
go
to
the
labor
board,
and
if
the
board
hasn't
ruled
on
it
you
have
to
go
to
the
labor
board?
unknown
speaker
what
would
be
those
situations?
unknown
speaker
what
besides
beck?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
what
do
you
say--
unknown
speaker
--what
would
you
say--
unknown
speaker
--what
is
the
remedy,
just...
if
by
coincidence,
i
read...
i
was
reading
the
record.
it
sounds
as
if
what
ms.
marquez
was
actually
upset
about,
at
least
originally,
was,
she
said
to
the
union,
take
the
$500
out
of
my
first
paycheck,
please.
i
don't
have
the
money
on
me.
i
just
don't
have
it,
and
the
union,
instead
of
saying,
okay,
said
no.
now,
that
seems,
given
her
side
of
it,
that
that
wasn't
very
reasonable,
and
suppose
that
she's
right
about
that,
what
kind
of
remedy
would
the
law
permit?
unknown
speaker
the
board
can
award
damages
against
the
union
measured
by
back...
by
lost
pay?
unknown
speaker
against
the
union?
unknown
speaker
mm
hmm.
mr.
geffner--
unknown
speaker
--at
some
stage
the
sg
told
us
that
this
matter
was
before
the
board,
this
matter
being
whether
the
beck
language
must
be
in
the
contract
clause
and
not
simply
in
a
notice
that
the
union
separately
gives
to
workers.
is
it
before
the
board?
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
we've
been
told
that
that
was--
unknown
speaker
--rejected
by
the
board.
unknown
speaker
why
wouldn't
the
employer
agree?
unknown
speaker
why
would
not
the
employer
agree
to
making
the
clause
less
favorable
to
the
union?
unknown
speaker
i
mean,
i
can
see
the
union
not
agreeing
to
it,
but
why
would
the
employer
not--
unknown
speaker
--it
wouldn't
take
much
to
find
an
absence
of
good
faith
bargaining
if
an
employer
does
not
let--
unknown
speaker
--the
union
modify
that
clause
in
a
way
that
favors
the
employer.
unknown
speaker
bargain
in
good
faith,
and
it
wouldn't
take
me
very
long
to
find
that
that's
pretty
bad
faith
bargaining,
if
the
union
wants
to
give
him
a
better
deal
than
he
now
has
and
he
doesn't
want
it.
