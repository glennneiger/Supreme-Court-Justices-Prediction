justice
sandra
day
o'connor
this
case
comes
to
us
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit.
the
petitioner
is
a
part-time
actress
who
successfully
auditioned
for
a
small
part
in
a
television
series.
it
was
being
produced
by
respondent,
lakeside
productions.
after
she
was
hired,
but
before
she
began
to
work,
she
was
told
that
she
would
have
to
comply
with
the
terms
of
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
between
lakeside
and
the
union
that
represented
all
employees
on
its
productions.
and
that
was
the
respondent's
screen
actor's
guild,
the
union.
under
the
collective
bargaining
agreement,
all
employees
were
required
to
become
members
of
the
union
within
30
days
of
their
employment.
this
clause
track
the
language
of
the
section
of
the
national
labor
relations
act
that
authorize
this
type
of
union
security
clause.
but
contract
did
not
go
on
and
explained
that
this
court
has
given
that
statutory
language
a
specialized
meaning.
specifically,
the
contract
did
not
explain
that
this
court
has
interpreted
the
statutory
language
to
allow
an
employee
to
satisfy
the
membership
condition
merely
by
paying
the
portion
of
the
union's
fees
attributable
to
its
role
as
the
exclusive
bargaining
agent
for
the
employees.
the
agreement
did,
however,
spell
out
that
it
interpreted
the
30-day
grace
period
to
begin
running
with
any
work
an
employee
had
done
in
the
entertainment
industry.
and
because
the
petitioner
had
previously
worked
in
the
industry
for
more
than
30
days,
she
had
to
comply
with
the
terms
of
that
clause.
when
she
had
not
paid
her
union
fees
by
the
day
of
the
filming,
lakeside
hired
a
different
actress
to
play
the
part.
the
petitioner
filed
suit
against
the
union
claiming
that
the
union's
agreement
was
deficient
in
two
ways,
the
collective
bargain
agreement.
she
alleged
the
union
security
clause
breached
the
union's
duty
to
treat
her
fairly
because
it
did
not
tell
her
that
membership
that's
written
in
the
clause
had
acquired
a
specialized
meaning
in
the
labor
law.
second,
she
alleged
that
the
union's
grace
period
provision,
a
30-day
provision,
was
inconsistent
with
the
terms
of
the
national
labor
relations
act.
now,
the
district
court
granted
summary
judgment
to
the
union,
holding
that
the
union
did
not
breach
its
duty
of
fair
representation
by
failing
to
spell
out
in
the
agreement
all
the
interpretation
associated
with
the
proper
enforcement
of
a
union
security
clause.
second,
the
district
court
held
that
petitioner's
challenge
to
the
grace
period
provision
was
really
just
to
claim
that
the
union's
clause
violated
the
statute,
a
kind
of
claim
that
fell
within
the
primary
jurisdiction
of
the
national
labor
relations
board,
not
the
federal
district
court.
on
appeal,
the
ninth
circuit
affirmed
the
district
court
judgment.
and
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
of
the
court
today,
we
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
ninth
circuit
court
of
appeals.
first,
we
held
that
a
union
does
not
breach
its
duty
of
fair
representation
merely
by
negotiating
a
union
security
clause
that
tracks
the
language
of
the
statute.
a
union
breaches
its
duty
of
fair
representation
when
its
conduct
toward
a
member
of
the
bargaining
unit
is
arbitrary,
discriminatory
or
in
bad
faith.
petitioner
does
not
allege
the
union's
conduct
was
discriminatory.
and
on
the
record
before
us,
we
could
not
conclude
that
the
union's
conduct
was
arbitrary
or
in
bad
faith.
we
do
not
decide
in
this
case.
petitioners
claims
that
the
union
illegally
enforced
the
union
security
clause.
and
that
it
breached
its
duty
of
fair
representation
by
failing
adequately
notify
of
her
rights
under
the
clause.
second
we
hold
the
petitioner's
challenge
to
the
30-day
grace
period
provision
falls
within
the
primary
jurisdiction
of
the
national
labor
relations
board.
her
claim
at
basis
is
a
claim
that
the
union's
clause
is
inconsistent
with
the
statute
and
this
type
of
claim
is
one
that
belongs
in
the
first
instance
before
the
board.
justice
kennedy
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion
which
justice
thomas
has
joined.
