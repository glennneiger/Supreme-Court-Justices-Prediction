mr.
leo
geffner
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court--
i
would
like
to
pick
up
my
argument
in
response
to
justice
ginsburg's
question
having
to
do
with
the
burden
or
the
obligation
of
the
duty
of
fair
representation,
which
started
out
as
we
know
in
the
racial
discrimination
that
led
into
vaca
v.
sipes,
involving
individuals,
and
into
the
o'neill
case,
where
the
court
addressed
the
question
of
what
is
a
duty
in
the
negotiations
of
a
collective
bargaining
agreement,
which
is
the
issue
in
the
beck
aspect
of
this
case.
the
factual
determinations
as
to
whether
there
was
a
violation
of
the
duty
of
fair
representation
regarding
notice
to
her,
or
information
to
her,
has
all
been
remanded
to
the
district
court.
the
district
court
on
summary
judgment
found
that
there
was
no
violation
based
on
the
depositions
in
the
discovery
procedures,
and
had
granted
summary
judgment.
mr.
leo
geffner
no.
no,
your
honor.
mr.
leo
geffner
before,
yes.
the
ninth
circuit
felt
there
were
some
factual
issues
that
should
be
resolved
by
the
trial
court,
the
district
court,
prior
to
looking
at
a
summary
judgment.
at
least,
there
was
a
number
of
facts
to
justify
a
summary
judgment.
the
test
in
negotiating
the
contract
in
terms
of
the
duty
of
fair
representation
is
a
very
heavy
one.
the
o'neill
case
very
clearly
stated,
and
the
language
is
very
strong,
that
not
only
does
the
union
action
have
to
be
arbitrary,
but
in
light
of
the
factual
and
legal
language
at
the
time
of
the
union's
action,
the
union's
behavior
is
so
far
outside
the
range
of
reasonableness
so
as
to
become
irrational
conduct.
mr.
leo
geffner
this
is
the
o'neill
case,
your
honor.
mr.
leo
geffner
not
at
all,
your
honor.
mr.
leo
geffner
no,
of
course
not.
mr.
leo
geffner
that,
your
honor,
i
don't
think
the...
the
beck
case
held,
in
my
opinion
that
the
duty
of
fair
representation
was
violated
in
terms
of
outside
of
a
statute.
8(a)(3)
was
used
as
a
defense
by
the
union,
which
was
rejected
by
the
court,
and
the
court
said
that
the
duty
was
violated
because
it
was
a
basic
principle
that
it's
a
violation
to
collect
dues
from
a
employee
under
a
union
security
clause
that
went
for
political
ideological--
mr.
leo
geffner
--well,
there
was
a
vigorous
defense
in
the
beck
case,
as
your
honor
well
knows,
yes.
mr.
leo
geffner
that
case--
mr.
leo
geffner
--yes.
mr.
leo
geffner
well,
your
honor,
beck
did
not
address
itself
to
the
negotiations
or
the
language
or
the
contract.
in
fact,
we
would
argue
that
the
beck
case
implied
that
the
contract
was
valid,
and
that
it
was
the
implementation
in
terms
of
the
collection
of
excessive
amount
of
dues
was
where
the
violation
occurred,
and
that
has
to
do
with
the
implementation
of
the
clause,
the
security
clause,
not
as
to
the
language,
not
as
to
the
negotiations.
that
is
where
this
burden
that
this
describes
comes
into
play,
and
we
would
argue
that
if
you
take
this
standard
of
irrationality,
or
beyond
the
range
of
reasonableness,
then
how
can
it
be
unreasonable,
how
can
it
be
irrational
for
the
union
to
negotiate
a
clause
that
is
traces
and
tracks
almost
word
for
word
the
statute
of
8(a)(3)?
mr.
leo
geffner
that
is
a
different
question--
mr.
leo
geffner
--justice
o'connor.
i
believe
that
is
a
different
question.
that...
unless
you
want
me
to
address
that
part
of
the
case,
but
i
would--
mr.
leo
geffner
--yes.
mr.
leo
geffner
yes.
mr.
leo
geffner
right.
mr.
leo
geffner
well--
mr.
leo
geffner
--well,
i--
mr.
leo
geffner
--well,
i
think
it's
very
important,
your
honor,
and
the
standard
is
a
very
difficult
one,
but
the
beck
case,
as
you
may
recall,
a
theory
of
the
plaintiff
in
the
beck
case
was
based
on
three
reasons,
one
that
there
was
a
violation
of
8(a)(3)
and
8(b)(2)
and
therefore,
per
se,
then
there
was
a
violation
of
the
duty
of
fair
representation.
and
second
was
that
there
was
a
constitutional
question,
and
third
that
there
was
a
pure
and
simple
duty
of
fair
representation
that
had
to
do
with
how
the
union
collected
its
dues
and
whether
it
collected
excess
amount
of
dues
over
objections
of
an
employee
for
political
purposes.
the
court
very
clearly...
in
fact,
i
think
this
was
a
unanimous
opinion
where
the
centrists
also
agreed
with
this
part
of
the
beck
case
that
the
claim
as
to
the
constitutional
issue
was
not
to
be
decided,
it
was
put
aside,
that
clearly
the
beck
court
said
that
the
issue
of
being
an
unfair
labor
practice,
and
that
in
itself,
a
violation
of
8(a)(3),
8(b)(2),
made
it
a
violation
of
the
duty
of
fair
representation,
was
not
the
law
and
was
not
the
basis
for
the
court
to
proceed
to
find
that
there
was
a
violation.
mr.
leo
geffner
that
part--
mr.
leo
geffner
--yes.
mr.
leo
geffner
well--
mr.
leo
geffner
--well,
then
i
think,
your
honor,
we
get
into
the
question,
can
the
primary
jurisdiction
of
the
board
be
totally
destroyed
in
this
area,
which
it
would
do,
because
the
argument
then
would
be,
any
violation--
mr.
leo
geffner
--well,
i
would
contend,
your
honor,
that
you
have
to
look
back
to
lockridge,
which
discussed
this
issue
in
very
great
detail,
and
judge
harlan
had
a
great
discussion
of
how
you
find
the
standard.
it's
a
difficult
one
to
find,
but
i
think
that
the
basis,
as
we
would
contend,
would
be
that
when
it's
a
primary
jurisdiction
it
has
to
do
with
a
clear
and...
violation
of
the
statute.
here
it's
clear
they're
saying
that
it's
a
violation
of
8(a)(3),
8(b)(2),
because
we
didn't
allow
the
base
period
of
30
days.
that
is
or
is
not
a
violation
of
8(a)(3)
and
8(b)(2).
it
has
nothing,
really,
to
do
with
any
representations,
any
misrepresentations,
any
hostility,
any
other
factors,
bad
faith,
that
goes
into...
to
make
up
the
duty
of
fair
representation.
all
the
standards
of
fair
representation
are
not
present.
this
pure
and
simple
was
a
violation
of
the
30
days
permissible
or
not
permissible.
it's
as
simple
as
that,
and
the
nlrb,
when
that
case
comes
before
it
as
some
future
time
will
decide.
they'll
say
no,
the
union
was
wrong,
they
didn't
apply
the
statute
correctly,
it's
therefore
an
unfair
labor
practice
and
there's
a
remedy
available
to
ms.
marquez
or
any
other
employee
that
files
the
charge.
mr.
leo
geffner
or
they
may
say--
mr.
leo
geffner
--no.
i
think
if
the
violation
is
clear
then
obviously
the
labor
board
has
the
authority
and
the
jurisdiction
to,
under
primary
jurisdiction
to
grant
relief.
mr.
leo
geffner
or
even
a
clear
violation--
mr.
leo
geffner
--well,
if
it's
not
clear--
mr.
leo
geffner
--if
it's
not
clear,
then
i
believe
that
it's
standard
that
the
courts
would
have
to
look,
as
to
whether
it
was
primary
jurisdiction
with
the
labor
board,
not
only
to
the
pleadings,
which
obviously
can
be
clothed
and
colored
any
way
the
plaintiff
wishes
to
color
it,
is
that,
is
there
interpretation...
and
assuming
it's
not
clear.
now,
you
take
the
30
day
clause
here--
mr.
leo
geffner
--no,
i'm
not.
mr.
leo
geffner
well,
i'm
saying
that
if
there's
a
clear
violation
of
the
statute,
8(a)(3)
or
8(b)(2),
then
the
board
has
the
primary
authority
to
issue
a
complaint,
to
hold
a
hearing,
and
to
find--
mr.
leo
geffner
--well--
mr.
leo
geffner
--well,
maybe
i
misspoke.
i
intended
to
answer
the
question
that
if
it's
clear
or
not
clear,
it
does
not
deprive
the
board
of
labor
of
primary
jurisdiction,
because--
mr.
leo
geffner
--well,
no.
i
think
lack
of
clarity
is
an
important
issue,
because...
and
i
want
to
use
our
case
as
an
example,
because
30
days...
and
the
statute
says
30
days.
it's
not
clear
which
30
days
we're
talking
about.
now,
this
is
an
issue
that
should
be
decided
under
the
labor
act
by
the
nlrb
under
the
primary
jurisdiction
because
they
are
the
body
with
the
expertise
to
look
at
the
entire
industry,
the
motion
picture
industry,
the
hiring
practices,
the
issue
of
a
multi
employer
bargaining
unit,
where
it's
permissible
under
board
cases
that
you
can
work
for
different
employers
and
tack
on
grace
periods,
and
that
goes
to
the
intent
of
the
parties
where
they
have
a
multi
employer
bargaining
unit.
these
are
all
questions
for
the
expertise
of
the
administrative
agency
of
the
nlrb.
these
are
not
really
questions
for
the
court
to
decide--
mr.
leo
geffner
--under
a
duty
of
fair
representation
standard.
mr.
leo
geffner
well,
i'm
not
sure
i
can
give
a
broad
standard
for
every
case.
mr.
leo
geffner
well,
i'll
try.
mr.
leo
geffner
all
right,
your
honor.
i...
are
we
bargaining
now,
your
honor?
[laughter]
i
think
this
case
presents
the
perfect
example
of
what
we're
talking
about.
it's
a
narrow
issue,
and
that
is
that
the
pleading
seems
to
mix
up
duty
of
fair
representation
as
a
violation
of
8(a)(3),
8(b)(2).
it's
a
question
of
how
the
complaint
is
worded.
when
you
cut
through
the
substance
of
it,
the
substance
of
it
is,
there
has
to
be
a
finding,
and
this
should
be
done
by
the
labor
board
first,
and
of
course
reviewed
by
the
courts,
is
that
when
the
parties
negotiated
this
contract
that
said
30
days,
did
they
violate
8(a)(3)
and
8(b)(2)?
now
the
nlrb
has
to
look
at
a
numerous
number
of
factors.
they
have
to
look
at
the
industry,
they
have
to
look
at
employment
practices,
as
i
said
earlier
the
multi
employer
unit
question...
that
is
not
a
function
of
the
board...
of
the
courts
to
decide
as
an
initial
matter
under
the
guise
of
a
duty
of
fair
representation
claim.
this
belongs
to
the
expertise
of
the
labor
board.
mr.
leo
geffner
that's
why
congress
set
them
up.
mr.
leo
geffner
it
usually
finds
that
that
case,
your
honor--
mr.
leo
geffner
--well,
there
certainly
would
be
a
violation
of...
it
would
be
an
unfair
labor
practice
case.
mr.
leo
geffner
well,
primary
jurisdiction,
your
honor,
yes.
mr.
leo
geffner
yes,
correct.
mr.
leo
geffner
correct.
mr.
leo
geffner
well,
of
course,
in
the
context
of
the
factual
situation
of
beck,
which
was
really
decided
essentially
that
there's
a
separate
duty
of
fair
representation
not
to
collect
excess
dues,
that
could
have
been
an
unfair
labor
practice
and
the
board
would
have
jurisdiction.
the
beck
case
said
that
under
that
theory,
that
there
was
jurisdiction
on
a
violation
of
the
duty
of
fair
representation.
i
don't
think
we
can
quarrel
with
that
finding
of
beck.
it
did
say
that.
but
that
had
to
do
with
what...
with
the
enforcement,
with
collection
and
how
dues
were
collected,
and
what
manner
in
terms
of
excess
amount
of
dues.
that's
where
the
duty
arose
in
terms
of
the
court
jurisdiction
on
a
dfr,
duty
of
fair
representation
complaint.
the
board--
mr.
leo
geffner
--the
board
could
have
concurrent
jurisdiction
as
well.
mr.
leo
geffner
well--
mr.
leo
geffner
--i
think
that
would
be
a
very
good
way,
a
rational
way
to
draw
the
line.
i
think
applying
beck
that's
exactly
what
would
happen
in
beck.
mr.
leo
geffner
i'm
not
sure
of
that,
your
honor,
but
the
problem
in
terms
of
avoiding
constitutional
issues,
which
of
course
beck
said
it
was
not
involved
in
the
beck
case,
but
i
think
i
agree
with
justice
souter
that
in
referring
back
to
the
street
case
and
the
railway
labor
act,
which
beck
was
based
on,
that
there
were
at
least
in
the
background
somewhere
some
constitutional
issues
about
collecting
money
from
people
over
their
objections
for
political
activities.
but
beyond
that,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
constitutional
questions
really
are
not
faced
in
this
area,
because
any
doubt...
any
doubt,
even
if
you
want
to
raise
it
to
the
dignity
of
a
constitutional
question,
is
resolved
by
the
point
that
was
made,
i
believe,
by
justice
ginsburg,
and
that
is,
the
union
is
required,
and
there's
a
very
clear
body
of
law
that
has
developed
in
the
last
few
years
by
the
nlrb
and
also
by
the
courts
in
california
saw
&
knife
and
the
paramax
case,
that
there's
an
affirmative
obligation
for
the
union
to
notify
every
person
that's
subject
to
the
union
security
clause
of
their
beck
rights.
in
fact,
they
go
even
further.
they
have
to
advise
them
of
numerous
rights
that
flow
from
the
beck
decision.
that
is
an
obligation
that
goes
beyond
anything
that
a
contract
might
do,
as
i
believe
one
of
the
justices
pointed
out,
because
that
obligation
that
the
board,
the
labor
board
is
now
imposing
has
to
be
shown
that
the
individual
received
that
notice.
whether
through
a
newspaper,
or
whether
through
a
mailer,
or
whether
through
an
application
form,
whatever
vehicle
is
used,
that
notice
has
to
be
given,
and
that's
where
any
constitutional
question
of
somebody
being
deprived
of
their
property
against
their
objections
for
political
reasons
is
clearly
avoided
and
clearly
remedied.
mr.
leo
geffner
and
as
i
say,
clearly,
yes,
i
agree
with
scanlon--
mr.
leo
geffner
--i
agree
100
percent
with
the
ninth
circuit.
i
was
responding,
i
believe
to
justice
souter's
question,
or
to
justice
scalia's
question
that
perhaps
in
the
background
when
the
court
decided
the
beck
case
there
was
some
concern
of
a
constitutional
question,
but
it
didn't
involve
political
activities
and
collecting
dues
for
political
activities.
and
the
beck
case
clearly
tagged
on
to
the
street
case,
which
is
a
railway
labor
act
case,
which
did
involve
a
constitutional
issue
because
of
the
statute
being
drafted
and
written
separately
and
differently
from
the
taft
hartley
act,
which
the
beck
case
didn't...
it
did
not
involve
the
constitutional
issue.
but
i
simply
agree
with
justice
scalia
that
somehow
you
could
look
up
in
the
sky
and
pick
that
issue
out
of
there.
but
clearly
the
holding
of
the
beck
case
was
not
on
constitutional
questions.
the
court
was
very
clear
that
that
basis
for
relief,
that
was
urged
by
the
petitioners
in
that
case,
was
not
the
grounds
for
the
beck
decision.
mr.
leo
geffner
well--
mr.
leo
geffner
--well--
mr.
leo
geffner
--well,
i...
i'm
not
so
sure
i'm
so
wise
as
to
have
one,
but
my
thinking
would
be,
your
honor,
that
the
standard
that
would
be
applied,
that
may
be
a
difficult
one,
is
that...
would
be
one,
is
the
claim
of
the
duty
of
fair
representation
really
something
that's
separate
from
a
pure
statutory
violation,
that
there's
some...
because
the
duty
of
fair
representation
was
really
a
judicially
declared
requirement
coming
out
of
the
early
cases
on
racial
discrimination
through
vaca
v.
sipes.
of
course,
the
labor
board
isn't
dealing
with
these
kinds
of
issues.
courts
must
deal
with
them,
because
the...
a
union
is
the
exclusive
representative,
and
there
should
be
some
protection
for
an
individual
against
the
majority
on
some
kind
of
abusive
or
bad
faith
action,
so
it
is
a
judicially
imposed
requirements
on
the
union,
not
a
statutory
one
as
such.
i
think
that
is
probably
part
of
the
one
standard
that
i
would
suggest.
the
other
i
would
suggest
is
the
one
i
said
earlier,
and
that
is,
is
it
the
kind
of
an
issue...
getting
beyond
the
pleadings,
is
it
the
kind
of
issue
that
really
is,
it
requires
the
expertise
of
the
administrative
agency?
is
this
the
kind
of
an
issue
that
really
the
court
shouldn't
be
dealing
with,
certainly
not
on
the
first
impression?
maybe
on
a
petition
to
review,
or
to
enforce,
but
as
a
first
impression...
and
that's
why
i
emphasize
the
30
day
case
as
a
perfect
example,
because
we
don't
know.
the
board
hasn't
really
ruled
on
this
30
day
clause,
and
there's
so
many
factors.
it
involves
industrial
relations.
it
involves
the
motion
picture
industry.
it
involves
how
you
employ,
how
you
involve
freelance
employment.
mr.
leo
geffner
an
employer,
your
honor?
mr.
leo
geffner
i'm
sorry.
no,
i
think
that
case
there
would
be
a
clear
violation
of
8(a)(3)
and
8(b)(2).
her
remedy
would
be
to
run
down
to
the
labor
board
and
file
a
charge.
mr.
leo
geffner
well,
i
can't
categorically
say
that
would
be
the
case,
because
there
could
be
situations
that
it
could
be
both,
as--
mr.
leo
geffner
--well,
i
think
the
beck
case
is
an
example
where
the--
mr.
leo
geffner
--what
besides
the
beck?
mr.
leo
geffner
well,
i...
on
a
duty
of
fair
representation
there
could
be
some
abusive
action
against
the...
by
a
union
against
an
employee
that
the
board
had
jurisdiction,
where
it's
a
violation
of
the
employee's
section
7
rights.
it
would
be
unfair
labor
practice,
but
it
also
might
be
a
tortious
action
against
the
individual,
or
it
could
be
some
kind
of
group
action
where
there's
a
violation
of
either
the
common
law,
or
of
the
broad,
broader
definition
of
the
duty
of
fair
representation.
that's...
it
could
be
a
situation
of
that
kind,
you
know.
the
o'neill
case
set
the
standard
of
the
duty
of
fair
representation.
in
that
case,
the
specifics
involved
the
negotiations
of
a
contract
and
the
settlement
agreement.
the
court
found
that
the
union
didn't
violate
that
standard,
but
it
could
have
gone
the
other
way,
and
there
you
would
have
had
a
case
where
there
had
been
a
violation
of
the
duty
of
fair
representation,
and
very
likely
would
be
an
unfair
labor
practice,
possibly,
under
a
violation
of
section
vii,
or
possibly
even
a
failure
to
bargain.
there
could
be
numerous
areas
of
the
taft
hartley
act
that
could
be
urged
as
an
unfair
labor
practice.
so
there
are
situations
where
there's
a
crossover,
and
where
you
draw
the
line,
i
think
all
we
can
do
is
what
beck
said,
and
what
lockridge
said,
where
judge
harlan
discussed
this,
and
i
suggest--
mr.
leo
geffner
--and
i
suggest
the
two
standards
that--
mr.
leo
geffner
--that
we
would
follow.
mr.
leo
geffner
well,
it...
she
could
have
filed
a
charge
with
the
labor
board
as
a
violation
of
8(a)(3)
and
8(b)(2).
the
board
would
then
have
the
jurisdiction
to
give
the
remedy
to
her,
which
would
have
been
back
pay
for
losing
the
1
day's
work.
that
would
probably
be
a
fairly
complete
remedy.
i
suppose
you
could
argue
that
because
she
was
badly
treated
as
an
individual,
it
was
bad
faith
in
her
treatment
outside
of
the
statute,
that
the
union
then
created
a
hostile
and
arbitrary
action.
there
might
be
a
df,
duty
of
fair
representation.
but
those
are
the
issues
that
relate
really
to
the
kind
of
issues
that
notice
goes
to,
and
information
goes
to,
and
that's
what
we're
dealing
with
here,
and
that
is
where
the
labor
board
has
set
up
an
elaborate
system
of
notice
requirements
which
takes
care
of
any
problems
that
might
be
coming
out
of
any
misunderstanding
of
the
contract
language,
which
she...
we're
back
to
the
main
issue
of
the
case,
or
at
least
the
beck
issue
in
the
case.
mr.
leo
geffner
it
can
award
lost
pay,
yes,
mm
hmm.
mr.
leo
geffner
against
the
union,
yes,
mm
hmm.
that
would
be
the
remedy
if
the
union
violated
8(a)(3)
and
8(b)(2).
that
would
be...
the
traditional
remedy
is
the
back
pay
remedy,
yes.
mr.
leo
geffner
yes.
mr.
leo
geffner
no,
your
honor.
that's
not
my
understanding
of
the
law.
the
board
at
this
point,
you
may
recall,
in
1958
in
the
keystone
cloth
case
said
that
membership
in
good
standing
is
the
model
clause.
mr.
leo
geffner
it's
moved
ahead,
yes.
mr.
leo
geffner
after
the
beck
case
and
the
paramax
case
the
board
said
that
the
clause
is
now
ambiguous,
but
not
facially
invalid.
now
they
say
it's
ambiguous,
but
before
they
said
it
was
not
ambiguous,
and
they
said
the
ambiguity
is
cleared
up
and
remedied
by
these
outside
notices
that
have
to
be
given
to
the
individuals,
so
that
clarifies
the
ambiguity.
now,
the
d.c.
circuit
reversed
the
board
and
said
no,
that...
the
clause
is
not
ambiguous,
the
clause
is
facially
valid,
and
reversed
the
board
on
that
issue,
and
now
the
board
is
wrestling
with
the
consequences
of
that
for
that
decision,
and
there's
some
dissention
in
the
board
itself,
actually,
on
that
issue
right
now,
but
cases
on
record...
cases
on
record,
the
paramax
case
says
very
clearly
that's
ambiguous,
that's
their
position,
but
not
facially
invalid.
and
that's
been,
as
i
said,
has
been
reversed
by
the
d.c.
circuit
in
saying
that
it
was
facially
valid,
and
all
the
notices
were
adequate
to
protect
the
individual
against
any
misunderstanding.
in
the
few
moments,
i'd
like
to
just
stress
one
point
here
in
terms
of
the
drastic
remedy
that
the
petitioners
are
asking
in
this
case,
to
declare
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
clause
invalid,
and
the
petitioner
and
i
believe
the
eighth
circuit
if
you
follow
their
argument
seem
to
think
that
the
union
has
the
right
to
unilaterally
just
modify
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
and
just
simply
change
it
to
make
it
clearer,
just
by
some...
just
miracle,
some
wave
of
the
hand.
it's
not
the
reality
of
labor
relations.
if
the
clauses
are
declared
invalid
then
the
union
has
to
renegotiate
with
the
employer.
clauses
that
have
been
in
effect
now
for
50
years
contained
in
thousands
of
contracts
in
this
country,
the
union
would
have
to
go
back
to
each
employer
and
renegotiate
the
contract,
and
that
raises
all
kinds
of
questions.
that
means
that
if
the
employer
doesn't
agree,
can
the
union
now
strike
to
obtain
a
modified
clause?
can
the
employer
lock
out
the
union?
mr.
leo
geffner
i
beg
your
pardon,
your
honor?
mr.
leo
geffner
well,
your
honor,
the
reality
of
collective--
mr.
leo
geffner
--because,
your
honor,
the
nature
of
collective
bargaining
is
that
everything
in
a
contract
is
the
subject
of
a
bargain,
subject
to
negotiations.
i
don't
find
many
employers,
nor
do
i
find
many
unions
who
agree
to
something
without
getting
something
in
return
for
it,
and
that's
the
reality
of
collective
bargaining.
mr.
leo
geffner
no,
your
honor--
mr.
leo
geffner
--your
honor,
the
law
is
clear
that
the
employer
can
refuse
a
union
security
clause
to
impasse.
that's
a
mandatory
subject
of
bargaining.
the
union...
the
employer
does
not
have
to
agree
to
any
union
security
clause.
mr.
leo
geffner
i...
it
would
be
a
very
serious
question,
your
honor,
that
in
terms
of
the
consequences,
when
you're
trying
to
renegotiate
the
contracts...
maybe
some
employers
would
take
that
position.
maybe
some
would
not.
we
don't
know,
and
that
goes
back
to
what
happens.
those
are
the
consequences
of
declaring
a
clause
invalid,
and
that
goes
back
to
the
original
intent
of
senator
taft
and
the
senate
and
the
congress
in
enacting
the
taft
hartley
act
and
authorizing
the
union
security
clause.
they
said
they
wanted
to
foreclose
and
close
out
the
closed
shop.
they
allowed
the
union
shop,
under
limited
circumstances,
and
it's
spelled
out
in
the
statute.
mr.
leo
geffner
thank
you,
your
honor.
