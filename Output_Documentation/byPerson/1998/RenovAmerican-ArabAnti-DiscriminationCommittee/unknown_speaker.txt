unknown
speaker
so
is
that
the
government's
position,
that
we
may
rely
on
that
representation
that
you
have
just
made
about
the
legal
position
that
the
government
would
take
in
those
circumstances?
unknown
speaker
but
you
would
concede
that
the
issue
may
properly
be
raised.
unknown
speaker
well,
mr.
stewart,
these
cases
were
pending
at
the
time
of
the
enactment
of
iirira,
were
they
not?
unknown
speaker
so
isn't
the
habeas
corpus
relief
provided
for
in
1105(b)
available?
unknown
speaker
but
as
i...
perhaps
i
don't
have
it
written
correctly
here.
it
says,
any
alien
held
in
custody
pursuant
to
an
order
of
deportation.
unknown
speaker
well,
surely
they
must
be
held
in
custody
before
they're...
you
can't
deport
them
without
having
them
in
custody.
unknown
speaker
what's
the
purpose
of
1105a(a)(9),
which
talks
about
habeas
corpus
for
people
held
in
custody
pursuant
to
an
order
of
deportation?
unknown
speaker
it's
very
bad
english
if
that's
what
it
means,
because
it
says
any
alien
held
in
custody
pursuant
to
an
order
of
deportation
may
obtain
judicial
review
thereof.
now,
that
thereof
refers
to
an
earlier
noun,
and
the
only
earlier
noun
available
is
order
of
deportation.
unknown
speaker
well,
to
the
extent
that
we
have
to
give
meaning
to
a
statute
that
is
certainly
ambiguous
in
part
as
to
how
it
works
in
the
interim,
period,
if
no
review
is
available
of
these
constitutional
claims,
that
might
influence
our
interpretation
of
the
statute.
that's
my
concern.
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
in
that
regard,
you
rely
in
part
on
2347(b)(3),
and
i
understand
you
to
say
you
think
that
would
be
available
even
though
there
would
have
been
a
hearing
before
the
agency.
unknown
speaker
on
a
particular
issue,
on
a
particular
constitutional
issue,
so
you
say
they...
now,
what
is
the
legal
effect
of
your
advice
to
us
on
that
interpretation
of
2347(b)(3)?
would
that
preclude
the
department
of
justice
when
the
case
actually
reaches
that
stage
from
making
a
contrary
argument,
do
you
think?
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
the
court
could
do
that
if
the
court
concluded
that
it
was
constitutionally
compelled?
what
if
the
court
merely
concluded,
as
you
sort
of
admit
as
of
now,
that
it's
a
very
serious
constitutional
doubt
on
the
issue?
unknown
speaker
and
your
reading
basically
is,
when
the
agency
has
not
held
a
hearing
on
the
particular
issue,
then
(b)(3)
triggers.
unknown
speaker
well,
can
we
proceed
on
the
assumption
that
mr.
cole
and
his
clients
cannot
make
in
the
administrative
proceeding
the
record
and
the
showing
that's
necessary
for
them
to
sustain...
support
their
legal
claim?
unknown
speaker
and
to
the
extent
that
there
is
a
temporal
urgency
to
first
amendment
claims,
then
we
have
to
proceed
on
the
further
assumption
that
a
first
amendment
claim
is
likely
to
be
delayed
pending
the
administrative
hearings,
the
adjudication
of
the
first
amendment
claims.
unknown
speaker
mr.
stewart,
i
take
it
from
everything
you've
said
here
and
in
your
brief
that
you
are
accepting
that
there
is
such
a
claim
as
selective
enforcement,
so
that
you
are
not
urging
in
any
way
what,
for
example,
this
court
held
in
the
whren
case,
that
you
don't
look
behind
what
the
officer
does
for
his
motive.
unknown
speaker
well,
there's
also
a
question
of
just
what
is
selective
enforcement
in
an
immigration
context,
since
the
immigration
statute
itself
is
laced
through
with
distinctions
as
to
nationality.
unknown
speaker
mr.
stewart,
is
there
anything
other
than
imagination?
is
there
any
experience?
have
there
been
any
past
cases
where
it
was
charged
that
the
immigration
and
nationality
act
was
being
enforced
in
an
impermissibly
selective
way
against
people
of
a
particular
race,
religion,
political
belief?
unknown
speaker
mr.
stewart,
these
particular
respondents,
the
deportation
proceedings
have
been
going
on
for
some
time,
have
they
not?
how
many
years
now?
unknown
speaker
and
do
we
still
have
all
of
the
respondents
before
us,
or
has
the
situation
changed
in
11
years?
unknown
speaker
mr.
stewart--
--none
of
these
people
are
in
custody.
unknown
speaker
thank
you.
would
you
walk
us
through
the
government's
position
in
this
case,
by
statutory
provision?
i
guess
the
first
one
we
have
to
look
to,
because
this
came
up
in
the
transitional
period,
the
first
provision
we
have
to
look
to
is
subsection
(g)--
unknown
speaker
--of
the
new
law.
unknown
speaker
17--
unknown
speaker
--okay,
so
that's
where
we
start.
unknown
speaker
now,
why...
and
you
say
that
this
somehow
refers
us
to
the
old
1105.
unknown
speaker
why
is
that?
i
mean,
it
says
except
as
provided
in
this
section--
unknown
speaker
--not
in
the
old
1105.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
but
it
can't
be
given
that
meaning--
unknown
speaker
--why?
unknown
speaker
without
regard.
unknown
speaker
well,
but
that
assumes...
it
seems
to
me
you're
reading
(g)
more
broadly
than
it
is
written,
as
though
it
applies
to
all
proceedings,
and
i
don't
read
(g)
that
way.
unknown
speaker
what
do
you
think
(g)
applies
to?
it
doesn't
apply
to
all
deportation
orders.
it
only
applies
to
the
decision
of
the
attorney
general
to
commence
a
proceeding,
or
the
decision
to
adjudicate
a
case,
not
the
result
of
the
adjudication,
the
decision
to
adjudicate,
and
the
decision
to
execute
a
removal
order,
not
to
make
the
removal
order,
but
to
execute
it.
isn't
that
as
narrow
as
it
is?
unknown
speaker
but
you
agree
it's
just
certain
narrow
claims.
it's
not
the
whole
order
of
deportation.
it
is
just...
one
of
which
types
of
claims
happens
to
be
the
one
here,
where
they're
saying
the
very
commencement
of
the
proceeding
was
discriminatory.
this
relates
only
to
those
narrow
decisions.
do
you
agree
with
that,
or
not?
unknown
speaker
geez.
unknown
speaker
well--
--it's
a
strange
way
to
say
it.
yes.
to
commence
proceedings,
adjudicate
cases,
or
execute
removal
orders.
unknown
speaker
those
are--
--adjudicated--
--very
specific--
unknown
speaker
--one
could
read
the
section
we're
talking
about
to
kind
of
run
the
gamut,
as
you
say,
to
commence
proceedings,
adjudicate
cases,
or
execute
removal
orders,
kind
of
from
beginning
to
end.
unknown
speaker
well,
what
if
we
don't?
what
if
we
disagree
with
you
and
think
it
has
a
narrower
meaning
in
this
subsection
(g),
and
that
it
just
applies
to
the
attorney
general's
decision
to
commence,
adjudicate,
or
execute
removal?
unknown
speaker
yes,
it
would
apply
here,
but
what
about
other
situations?
well,
would
you
have
to
leap
back
to
1105?
couldn't
you
simply
say
it
refers
back
to
the
new
section?
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
even
if
you
do
that
you've
got
to
decide
what
the
new
section
is.
is
it
section
306
of
the
revised
statute,
or
is
it
1242
of
the
code,
and
if
you
make
it
1242,
then
you
don't
pick
up
309,
as
you
do.
you're
quoting
the
transition
rule
that
comes
out
of
section
309
of
the
revised
statutes.
that's
not
part
of
1242.
that's
right.
unknown
speaker
and
why
doesn't
the
word,
this
section,
refer
to
1242
as
amended?
unknown
speaker
you
just
ignore
309(c),
it
seems
to
me.
unknown
speaker
well,
the
first
question
is,
what
do
the
words
this
section
mean?
it
seems
to
me
you've
got
two
choices,
either
306
of
the
revised
statutes
or
1242
of
the
code.
you
don't
have
309,
i
don't
think.
unknown
speaker
well,
but
then
if
you
don't
have
309,
that
doesn't
apply.
that
doesn't
affect
your
reading
of
(g).
unknown
speaker
but
if
you
think
12...
but
if
you
think
(g)
does
not
apply
to
final
orders
anyway,
then
nine
has
no
application
to
(g).
if
you're
reading
(g)
more
narrowly
so
that
it
doesn't
apply
to
final
orders,
it
applies
only
to
the
attorneys
general
decision
to
commence,
to
adjudicate
a
case,
or
to
execute
a
removal
order.
it
doesn't
apply
to
the
final
product,
which
is
the
decision
regarding
deportation.
unknown
speaker
then
you
wouldn't
have
to
go...
then
309
wouldn't
govern
it,
right?
unknown
speaker
yes.
now,
the
ninth
circuit
read
(g)
as
requiring
it
to
go
through
all
of
252
to
see
if
the
action
could
be
maintained.
unknown
speaker
and
it
relied
on
(f)(2)...
(f)(1).
unknown
speaker
and
what's
the
matter
with
that?
unknown
speaker
is
there
any...
to
go
back...
can
i
go
back
to
justice
kennedy's
first
question...
do
you
remember
the
first
amendment
question?
and
i'd
like
to
ask,
assuming
for
argument's
sake...
i
know
you
don't
agree
with
the
assumption...
that
they
had
a
valid
claim
of
immediate
irreparable
first
amendment
injury
by
going
ahead
with
a
deportation,
could
you
not...
i
want
to
know
if
you
agree
with
this.
could
you
not
use
principles
such
as
have
been
found
in
mathews
v.
eldridge,
bowen
v.
city
of
new
york,
where
this
court
and
other
courts
have
said
that
an
agency
must
waive
its
right
to
compel
exhaustion
where
an
issue
is
collateral,
where
there's
serious
harm,
where
the
agency
decision
makes
no
difference?
unknown
speaker
they
haven't
said
constitutional
right,
but
they
have
said,
really
which
is
a
weaker
case,
that
where
there
is
irreparable
harm,
it's
a
collateral
issue,
and
there's
really...
it's
separable
from
the
case...
they
said
that
in
mathews
v.
eldridge,
we
won't
require...
that
is...
we're
not
just
requiring
it.
the
fiction
is,
the
court
forces
the
agency
to
waive
its
right
to
exhaustion.
that's
at
least
one
way
it's
been
put,
and
i
just
wonder
if
in
a
real
first
amendment
case...
and
theirs
may
be.
they
say
it
is...
that
wouldn't
be
available
to
them.
and
maybe
you
don't
have
an
answer
to
that,
and
that's
understandable.
unknown
speaker
very
well,
mr.
stewart.
mr.
cole,
we'll
hear
from
you.
unknown
speaker
it
is
not
clear
to
me
why
the
deportation
process
can't
address
their
first
amendment
claims.
the
government
seems
to
say
that.
you
seem
to
say
it.
it's
not
clear
to
me
why.
the
whole
basis
for
the
deportation
proceeding
is
that
they
have
engaged
in
this
activity.
that
presents
it
right
fairly
in
the
record.
why
can't
the
court
of
appeals,
on
review
of
the
order,
say,
well,
this
is
a
first
amendment
problem?
unknown
speaker
they're
being
deported
because
of
their
political
associations.
that's
not
the
contention.
i
mean,
one
must
assume
for
purposes
of
your
argument
that
they
are
deportable.
you
call
them
technical
violations,
but
the
fact
is,
they
are
not
in
compliance
with
what...
i
mean,
we
must
assume
for
purposes
of
this
case
they
are
not
in
compliance
with
what
is
necessary
to
remain
in
this
country
as
aliens.
unknown
speaker
and
your
assertion
is
that
the
only
reason
they
have
been
picked
on
is
because
of
their
political
reasons.
unknown
speaker
okay.
unknown
speaker
that's
not
to
say
they've
been
deported
because
of
that.
they've
been
deported
because
they
were
in
violation
of
the
immigration
laws.
unknown
speaker
mr.
cole,
supposing
you
had
a
selective
enforcement
claim
in
a
prosecution
in
the
district
court,
and
the
district
court
ruled
against
you,
you
wouldn't
have
a
right
of
immediate
appeal
to
the
court
of
appeals
on
that,
would
you?
unknown
speaker
mr.
cole,
haven't
you
had
discovery?
unknown
speaker
have
you
not
had
discovery
in
this
case?
unknown
speaker
how
long
has
the
case
been
pending?
unknown
speaker
and
during
those
11
years
you
have
not
been
able
to
conclude
discovery?
unknown
speaker
when
did
you
make
that
showing?
i'm
just--
unknown
speaker
--and
how
long
a
period
between
1994
and
1996
were
you
permitted
to
engage
in
discovery?
unknown
speaker
well,
granting
they
object
all
along
the
line,
but
you...
i
had
the
feeling
you
did
have
plenty
of
time
to
persuade
the
district
court
that
there
was
merit
to
your
claim,
and
that
you
must
have
gotten
a
pretty
good
share
of
the
facts
you
need
for
the
whole
case.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
know,
but
you
in
fact
have
had,
is
what
i'm
trying
to
say.
unknown
speaker
well,
but
of
course,
this
is
kind
of
a
very
unusual
case
in
a
lot
of
ways.
it's
a
transition
situation,
and
it
seems
to
me
we
should
take
into
account
the
actual
facts
of
this
transition
case,
which
is
one,
as
i
understand
it,
you
pretty
well
have
the
facts
that
you're
going
to
litigate
about
later.
maybe
i'm
wrong.
maybe
there's
a
lot
of
other
stuff
you
need,
but
i
don't
know
what
it
would
be.
unknown
speaker
why
is
this
case
different
from
an
ordinary
administrative
law
case?
i
would
have
thought
the
ordinary
route
is,
you
go
first
to
the
agency,
they
decide
a
thing
on
the
basis
of
the
issues
in
front
of
them,
and
they
create
a
record.
then
you
go
to
the
court
of
appeals,
and
they
look
at
the
record.
in
an
unusual
case,
where
they
didn't
develop
enough
of
a
record,
of
course
the
court
of
appeals
can
send
it
to
a
district
court
or
anywhere
else
to
get
record
facts
developed
where
necessary.
that's
the
traditional
way.
the
statutes
are
consistent
with
that.
and
where
you
have
an
unusual
claim
that
requires
immediate
decision,
it's
collateral
from
the
main
case
and
threatens
irreparable
injury,
a
court
of
appeals
can
hear
that
first.
they
did
it
in
mathews
and
eldridge,
they've
done
it
in
bowen,
they
did
it
in
the
cases
involving
the
haitian
refugees,
they've
done
it
in
dozens
of
cases,
so
i
mean,
that
would
be
the
normal
route.
go
first
to
the
agency.
unknown
speaker
then
you
go
to
the
court
of
appeals,
then
you
go
to
a
district
court
if
you
need
to,
and
if
you
have
something...
irreparable,
serious
harm,
you
get
to
jump
the
queue,
all
right.
now,
aren't
the
statutes
consistent
with
that
as
much
as
they
are
in
any
case,
and
why
can't
you
follow
that
rule?
unknown
speaker
they
always
say
that
in
administrative
law
cases.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
all
right,
so
just
pause
right
there.
your
remedy
for
that,
saying
solely
on
the
record,
rather
than
read
it
solely
on
the
record
in
a
case
that
you
can
read
it
solely
on
the
record...
you
know,
solely
on
the
record
in
the
ordinary
case...
your
remedy
is,
rather
than
read
it
that
way,
we
should
create
some
whole
new
set
of
court
remedies
that...
that's
like
burning
down
the
house
because...
i
mean,
you
see--
unknown
speaker
--you're
advocating
departing
even
further
from
what
congress
wanted.
unknown
speaker
no.
--justice
breyer,
and
for
this
reason.
the
traditional
way
that
these
types
of
claims
were
raised
was
to
go
to
district
court.
every
court
which
addressed
a
claim
in
an
1105a
appeal
that
required
fact
finding
beyond
the
record
said,
we
don't
have
jurisdiction.
they
said
that
at
the
ins'
urging.
the
ins
took
the
exact
opposite
position
in
every
prior
1105a
appeal
raising
claims
requiring
fact
finding
beyond
the
administrative
record.
they
said,
there's
no
jurisdiction
here
because
of
the
administrative
record
language.
you
can't
transfer
to
a
district
court
because
of
the
administrative
record
language.
transfer
to
district
court
would
obviously
be
beyond
the
administrative
record.
therefore,
under
cheng
fan
kwok
and
mcnary
you
go
to
district
court,
and
that's
the
traditional
way
this
was
done.
now,
in
1996,
in
the
1996
act
that
the
government
relies
upon,
congress
took
up
this
matter
and
they
actually
went
to
the
point
of
adopting
in
the
senate
bill
a
provision
that
would
have
changed
that
rule,
would
have
said
that
constitutional
claims
requiring
fact
finding
beyond
the
administrative
record
can
be
transferred
to
district
court,
but
they
rejected
that
in
the
final
bill
and
instead
they
readopted
the
language
which
had
been
uniformly
interpreted
to
bar
appellate
jurisdiction
at
all
of
claims--
--which
language
is
that,
mr.
cole,
the--
unknown
speaker
--the
one
they
adopt...
they
adopted,
readopted.
unknown
speaker
you're
reading
from...
whereabouts
on
10a
are
you
reading?
unknown
speaker
okay.
unknown
speaker
but
it
would
apply
your
argument
to
all
constitutional
claims,
i
guess,
and
some
are
suitable
for
fact
finding,
and
others--
unknown
speaker
--are
not,
and--
unknown
speaker
--yes.
unknown
speaker
mr.
cole,
you
left
one
thing
out
of
your
story.
they
did,
indeed,
adopt
that
language
from
1105
which
we
had
held
would
allow
you
to
go
to
district
court.
but
they
also
added
to
the
new
statute
subsection
(9),
which
is
on
page
13a
of
the
government
brief,
which
says...
which
reads,
consolidation
of
questions
for
judicial
review
judicial
review
of
all
questions
of
law
and
fact,
including
interpretation
application
of
constitutional
and
statutory
provisions,
arising
from
any
action
taken
or
proceeding
brought
to
remove
an
alien,
shall
be
available
only
in
judicial
review
of
a
final
order
under
this
section.
unknown
speaker
now,
that
wasn't
in
the
old
1105.
unknown
speaker
it
is
in
this,
and
it
makes
it
very
clear
that
congress
did
not
intend
the
previous
disposition
of
being
able
to
go
to
district
court
with
one
of
these
claims
to
continue.
unknown
speaker
that
depends.
the
government
conceded
it
but
also
said
that
you
could
interpret
(g),
when
it
says
except
as
provided
to
this
section,
to
include,
to
refer
back
to
the
new
section.
unknown
speaker
and
that's
the
way
i
do
indeed
read
it.
unknown
speaker
so
i
think
this
section
does
apply.
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
mr.
cole,
what
about
the
possibility
that
was
vaguely
mentioned
of
the
attorney
general
electing
to
have
these
transitional
cases
handled
only
under
1252?
unknown
speaker
is
she
prevented
from
doing
that
here
by
anything
having
to
do
with
this
lawsuit,
or
just,
she
has
chosen
not
to
exercise
discretion
that
she
has?
unknown
speaker
so
if
she
wanted
to
make
that
election
she
couldn't
because
she's
been
enjoined.
unknown
speaker
your
interpretation
of
(g),
i
mean,
is
very
nice.
it
would
be
wonderful
if
that's
what
it
said,
but
i
see
nothing
in
there
that
limits
it
to
those
cases
where
the
attorney
general
has
exercised
the
option--
unknown
speaker
--to
have
the
new
statute
apply.
what
language
do
you
rely
upon
to
limit
it
to
that?
unknown
speaker
all
past,
pending
or--
unknown
speaker
--future
exclusion--
unknown
speaker
--that's
why
you
can...
can't
you
read
it...
i
mean,
one
way
to
read
it
is
to
say,
very
well,
in
this
odd
transitional
period
congress
wanted
no
court
to
have
the
authority
to
decide
fact
based
constitutional
questions.
that's
very
unlikely.
the
other
possibility
is
to
say,
well,
what
you
do
with
these
transitional
cases
with
fact
based
constitutional
questions
is,
you
apply
the
old
statute.
now,
when
you
apply
the
old
statute,
you're
reading
the
statute
in
a
way
that
again
will
reach
the
result,
no
constitutional
review,
which
might
well
make
it
unconstitutional.
but
the
other
alternative
for
us
is
to
read
the
old
statute
and
to
say,
we
can
read
that
in
a
way,
granted,
stretching
the
language
under
constitutional
compulsion,
that
will
give
you
the
judicial
review
that
you
want,
indeed,
at
the
time
you
want,
if
you
can
make
out
a
case
for
an
emergency,
irreparable
harm,
et
cetera.
now,
what's
wrong
with
that?
unknown
speaker
that
means
in
cases
appropriate.
right,
it
does--
unknown
speaker
--the
alternative,
though,
being
to
say
that
those...
the
whole
thing
is
unconstitutional,
and
then
make
up
a
set
of
procedures
that
would
virtually
parallel
that
but
make
it
up
on
our
own.
unknown
speaker
well,
if
it
didn't
intend
that,
it
didn't
do
very
much
good
in
this
amendment
of
the
immigration
law.
it's
clear
that
what
the
amendments
were
intended
to
do
is
to
prevent
exactly
what
is
going
on
here,
stringing
out
the
deportation
endlessly
while
suits
are
brought
in
district
court
that
interfere
with
the
smooth
progression
and
ultimate
disposition
of
the
deportation
proceeding.
it's
clear
that
that's
what
congress
had
in
mind,
and
what
you're
saying
is,
congress
didn't
have
that
in
mind.
now,
maybe
you
want
to
say
congress
can't
have
that
in
mind,
and
strike
down
the
whole
thing
as
unconstitutional,
but
to
read
it
to
do
something
which
is
just
implausible
in
light
of
what
congress
was
about
in
this--
unknown
speaker
--congress
was
certainly
concerned
about,
as
justice
scalia...
stringing
out
deportation
proceedings--
unknown
speaker
--which
is
just
what
your
case
is
doing.
unknown
speaker
why
are
we
talking
about
6
or
7
more
years
of
litigation
when
we've
had
11
already?
unknown
speaker
well--
unknown
speaker
--you've
been
seeking
to
get
expeditious
resolution
of
your
claim
that
the
case
is
improperly
brought.
unknown
speaker
the
government
wants
an
expeditious
ruling
on
the
merits
of
the
claim
about
the
case,
should
your
people
be
deported.
unknown
speaker
well,
newspapers
can't
be
deported.
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
newspapers
don't
gain
anything
by
stalling.
de--
unknown
speaker
--potential
deportees
do.
two
of
these
people
already
are
no
longer
deportable.
i
don't
know
why,
because
they've
gotten
married,
because
for
some
other
reason.
their
status
has
changed
in
the
interim.
everybody
knows
that
this
is
the
name
of
the
game.
string
it
out,
and
the
longer
it's
strung
out
the
less
likely
the
deportation
will
be.
newspapers
don't
worry
about
these
things.
i
mean,
there
is
not
the
risk
of,
what
should
i
say,
gaming
the
system,
which
goes
on
in
immigration
cases.
unknown
speaker
is
that
what
the
government
said,
or
the
government
said
we
just
want
to
deport
you?
unknown
speaker
can't
you
bring
that
up
in
the
agency
proceeding?
the--
unknown
speaker
--on
what
ground,
irrelevant,
or--
unknown
speaker
--is
that
good
law?
unknown
speaker
mr.
cole,
it
may
well
be
that
your
clients
were
targeted
for
ideological
reasons,
but
the
point
is...
and
this
is
what
congress
was
concerned
about...
anybody
can
claim
that
they're
being
deported
for
ideological
reasons--
unknown
speaker
--and
file
a
claim
in
district
court,
and
wait
for
2
years
to
get
that
claim
adjudicated
by
the
district
court.
unknown
speaker
anybody.
you
can
just
file--
unknown
speaker
--what
were
the
two
others,
mr.
cole?
unknown
speaker
well,
if
it
should...
if
it
should,
wouldn't
the
expeditious
thing
be
to
have
all
this
heard
in
one
proceeding?
i
mean,
whatever
the
shoulds
are,
wouldn't
that
be
a
better
way
to
do
it?
unknown
speaker
but
you...
it
was
very
sparse.
you
just
said
there
were
only
two
prior
cases.
unknown
speaker
of
course,
in
this
case
that
argument
doesn't
seem
to
fit,
because
it
would...
if
your
people
continue
to
engage
in
this
speech
activity
that
you're
concerned
about,
that
won't
hurt
their
case
at
all.
i
mean,
either
they're
deportable
or
not.
they've
already
been
selected
on
the
basis
of
prior
speech
activity--
unknown
speaker
--so
how
can
future
speech
activity--
unknown
speaker
--thank
you,
mr.
cole.
unknown
speaker
don't
fault
them
for
that.
unknown
speaker
that's
standard
in
depor...
and
you
would
do
it
yourself--
unknown
speaker
--if
you
were
representing
somebody.
