mr.
stewart,
may
i
ask
you,
what
if
the
statutory
scheme
precluded
review
of
a
constitutional
claim
such
as
these
respondents
make?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
right.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
we
don't
know
at
this
juncture
if
your
interpretation
of
the
statute
is
correct.
what
other
mechanisms
exist
for
review
of
their
constitutional
claim?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
it
requires
a
factual
development
in
their
case.
