mr.
david
d.
cole
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court--
the
government
in
this
case
admittedly
targeted
plaintiffs
for
core
political
activity
such
as
distributing
magazines,
belonging
to
a
group,
and
donating
funds
to
that
group's
lawful
activities.
it
did
so
avowedly
for
the
purpose
of
disrupting
those
political
activities.
it
now
contends
that
plaintiffs
cannot
obtain
a
judicial
ruling
on
whether
they
have
a
first
amendment
right
to
engage
in
these
activities
for
the
entire
period
of
time
that
it
takes
the
deportation
process
to
run
its
course,
even
though
the
deportation
process
cannot
address
their
first
amendment
claims,
nor
develop
the
necessary
facts.
mr.
david
d.
cole
well,
in
fact,
justice
kennedy,
the
basis
for
the
deportation
of
six
of
the
eight
has
nothing
to
do
with,
the
ostensible
basis
has
nothing
to
do
with
these
political
activities.
the
ostensible
basis
is
that
one
student
took
too
few
credits
when
he
was
in
school,
another
worked
without
authorization
when
he
was
in
school.
the
government,
when
they
brought
the
charges,
when
they
brought
these
technical
charges
said...
had
a
press
conference
to
say,
we
don't
care
what
the
technical
charges
are.
we
want
to
deport
them
because
they're
associated
with
the
pflp.
we
view
this
as
a
football
game.
we
don't
care
how
we
score.
so
our
clients
have
been
told,
you've
been
put
into
deportation
proceedings
because
of
your
political
associations.
you're
not
going
to
be
able
to
litigate
that
in
the
proceeding
itself.
in
fact,
we
attempted
to
litigate
it
in
the
proceeding
itself,
the
government
objected,
succeeded,
the
bia
ruled
that
we
couldn't
adjudicate
it,
and
the
government--
mr.
david
d.
cole
--well,
in
fact--
mr.
david
d.
cole
--right.
mr.
david
d.
cole
which
is
the
same
as
any
other
select
prosecution
claim.
mr.
david
d.
cole
no,
but
when
you
make
a
selective
enforcement
claim,
you
show
that
similarly
situated
others,
that
is,
other
students
who
didn't
take
enough
credits,
have
not
been
deported,
and
that
they
singled
your
client
out
for
an
impermissible
basis,
namely
his
political
associations,
which
are
protected
by
the
first
amendment,
and
that
is
a
traditional
basis
of
a
selective
enforcement--
mr.
david
d.
cole
--you
probably
wouldn't
have
a
right
of
immediate
appeal,
but
you
would
have
had
a
right
to
raise
that
claim
in
a
federal
court,
to
get
it
adjudicated
and
to
get
discovery
on
it
if
appropriate.
in
this
case,
the
government's
position
is,
for
the
many
years
it
takes
the
deportation
process
to
conclude,
which
can
be
5,
6,
7,
10
years,
you
can't
even
get
discovery.
this
court
in
clinton
v.
jones
recognized
that
delay
in
discovery
is
significantly
prejudicial
to
plaintiffs.
here,
they're
saying
we
can't
even
raise
our
claim
until
we
exhaust
a
proceeding
that
cannot
address
our
claim
in
any
way,
that
does
not
provide
us
any
form
of--
mr.
david
d.
cole
--i'm
sorry.
mr.
david
d.
cole
we've
been
able
to
start
discovery.
the
government
has
successfully
stayed
discovery
as
a
result
of
this
jurisdictional
question,
so
we
have
been
blocked.
we've
been
blocked--
mr.
david
d.
cole
--the
case
has
been
pending
since
the
government
brought
it
11
years
ago.
mr.
david
d.
cole
well,
we
were
not
permitted
to
engage
in
discovery
at
all,
justice
stevens,
under
this
court's
selective
prosecution
doctrine
until
we
demonstrated
a
colorable
showing
on
both
prongs.
mr.
david
d.
cole
in
1994
the
court
found
that
with
respect
to
six
of
the
eight
we
had
made
that
showing.
in
1996
it
extended
that
to
the
other
two.
mr.
david
d.
cole
we
were
permitted
to
engage
in
discovery
for
much
of
that
period
of
time,
although
there
were
issues...
the
government
objected
to
virtually
every
discovery
claim
we
brought--
mr.
david
d.
cole
--we
did,
your
honor,
but
the
position
that
the
government
is
taking
in
this
case
would
mean
that
we
would
never
have
had
that
opportunity.
we
would
never--
mr.
david
d.
cole
--right,
but
in
terms
of
the
legal
question
about
how
it's...
how
the
statute
is
appropriately
read,
should
it
be
read
to
allow
the
government--
mr.
david
d.
cole
--well,
there's
still
significant
discovery
outstanding,
including
depositions
of
a
number
of
the
individuals
who
were
involved,
and
ultimately
what
we
have
to
show
is
the
government's
motive.
mr.
david
d.
cole
in
fact--
mr.
david
d.
cole
--the
statutes
are
not
consistent
with
that,
your
honor.
the
first
reason
is
that
section
1105a
unambiguously...
there's
not
much
that's
unambiguous
about
these
statutes,
but
one
thing
is
unambiguous
about
1105a
and
the
1996
act,
and
that
is
that
the
petition
for
review,
which
is
authorized
by
statute,
must
be
determined
solely
upon
the
administrative
record,
with
one
exception.
the
one
exception
is
for
nationality
claims.
those
claims
can
be
transferred
to
a
district
court.
but
what...
so
what
congress
said
was,
appellate
jurisdiction
here
has
to
be
remedied
through
the
administrative--
mr.
david
d.
cole
--no,
in
fact
there
is
no...
justice--
mr.
david
d.
cole
--justice
breyer,
we've
found
and
the
government
has
cited
to
no
other
statute
governing
administrative
appeals
that
provides
that
the
petition
for
review
must
be
based
solely
on
the
administrative
record
creating
one
exception,
and
in
19...
and
every--
mr.
david
d.
cole
--no.
mr.
david
d.
cole
no,
i
don't
think
so--
mr.
david
d.
cole
--the
language
which
was
rejected
is
in--
mr.
david
d.
cole
--the
language
they
readopted
is...
was
originally
in
1105a(a)(4),
which
says
that
the
appeal
shall
be
decided...
let
me
get
you
the
page.
it's
on
page
2a
of
the
government's
brief.
it's
determination
upon
administrative
record
at
the
bottom
of
the
page,
except
as
provided
in
clause
(b),
which
refers
to
the
nationality
claims,
this...
the
petition
shall
be
determined
solely
upon
the
administrative
record
upon
which
the
deportation
order
is
based.
now,
that
was
the...
that
provision
the
government
had
argued
consistently
before
this
case
barred
the
court
of
appeals
from
hearing
the
kind
of
claim
that
we
are
now
making.
they
said
you
have
to
go
to
district
court.
this
court
in
mcnary
said
that
that
exact
type
of
language
meant
that
the
exclusive
appellate
review
scheme
did
not
cover
claims
requiring
fact
finding
beyond
the
administrative
record.
now,
if
you
turn
to
page
10a...
this
is
the
'96
act.
congress
first
considers,
as
i
said,
considers
a
bill
that
says,
constitutional
claims
requiring
fact
finding
can
be
transferred
to
the
district
court.
they
reject
that
and
instead
they
adopt
the
language
on
page
10a.
the
court
of
appeals,
except
as
provided
in
paragraph
(5)(b),
and
that's
again--
mr.
david
d.
cole
--the
top
of
10a.
mr.
david
d.
cole
under
scope
and
standard
for
review.
it
says,
except
as
provided
in
paragraph
(5)(b),
and
then
that's...
again
that's
a
reference
to
the
nationality
claim,
the
only
claim
that
congress
has
said
can
be...
facts
can
be
developed
beyond
the
administrative
record.
except
as
provided
in
(5)(b),
the
court
of
appeals
shall
decide
the
petition
only
on
the
administrative
record
on
which
the
order
of
removal
is
based.
so
congress
considered
the
precise
option
which
the
government
is
now
saying
is
available
on
the
court
of
appeals,
and
it
decided
to
reject
that
option
and
instead
to
leave
these
claims
where
they
had
traditionally
been
litigated
in
district
court,
and
i
think
for
good
reason.
why?
because
these
are
claims
that
require
fact
finding,
intensive
fact
finding.
that's
the
kind
of
thing
that
district
courts
are
well
suited
to,
not
courts
of
appeals.
mr.
david
d.
cole
no--
mr.
david
d.
cole
--this
claim...
i'm
sorry,
justice
breyer,
but
this
claim...
our
argument
with
respect
to
this
provision--
mr.
david
d.
cole
--does
not
apply
to
all
constitutional
claims.
chadha,
for
example,
was
a
constitutional
claim
that
could
be
decided
without
any
fact
finding
beyond
the
administrative
record,
and
therefore
was
appropriately
heard
on
the--
mr.
david
d.
cole
--that's
right.
mr.
david
d.
cole
that's
true.
mr.
david
d.
cole
well,
i
beg
to
differ,
justice
scalia.
the...
first
of
all,
(b)(9)
does
not
apply
to
this
case,
as
the
government
concedes,
because
of
the
transition
rules,
so
(b)(9)
is
actually
not
applicable,
and
you
have
to
then
ask,
why
did
congress
not
choose
to
apply--
mr.
david
d.
cole
--well--
mr.
david
d.
cole
--well,
i--
mr.
david
d.
cole
--no,
but...
no,
but
your
honor,
what
the
government
has
said...
i
mean,
what...
it's...
i
agree
with
you
that
(g),
when
it
says
except
as
provided
in
this
section
no
court
shall
have
jurisdiction,
refers
back
to
1252.
mr.
david
d.
cole
but
congress
has
made
clear
that
1252
does
not
apply.
the
only
provision
that
even
arguably
applies
here
from
the
new
act
is
1252(g).
they
have
made
it
absolutely
clear
that
the
rest
of
1252
is
not
applicable,
and
we
argue--
mr.
david
d.
cole
--right.
well,
that's
how
we
think
subsection
(g)
can
be
made...
can
be
rendered
coherent.
that
is
to
say,
subsection
(g)
applies
to
those
cases...
what
congress
said
was
pipeline
cases,
cases
which
were
pending
at
the
time
the
law
went
into
effect,
should
be
covered
by
the
old
statutory
scheme,
not
the
new
statutory
scheme.
the
government
agrees
with
that,
with
one
exception,
subsection
(g).
we
think
subsection
(g)
is
better
read
as
making
clear
that
in
transitional
cases,
that
is,
cases
that
are
pending,
where
the
attorney
general
elects
to
invoke
the
new
procedures,
which
she
is
permitted
to
do
by
statute,
in
those
cases,
subsection
(g)
makes
clear
that
1252
is
the
exclusive
review
scheme,
but
only
in
those
cases.
the
problem
with--
mr.
david
d.
cole
--well,
she's
been
enjoined
from
taking
any
action
with
respect
to
the
deportation
proceedings
in
these
cases.
mr.
david
d.
cole
that's
right.
that's
our...
that
is
our
reading.
that
would
obviously
be
open
to
the
district
court
on
remand,
but
i--
mr.
david
d.
cole
--well,
the
problem--
mr.
david
d.
cole
--well,
the...
there's
an
admitted
tension,
justice
scalia,
between
section
309(c),
which
says
that
for
pending
proceedings
the
new
rules
do
not
apply,
they
should
be
governed
by
the
old
section
1105a
scheme,
and
subject
only
to
the
exceptions
set
forth
in
succeeding
provisions,
which
do
not
include
(g)...
there's
a
tension
between
that,
which
seems
to
say
1105a
applies,
and
306(c),
which
the
government
relies
on,
which
suggests
that
subsection
(g)
shall
apply
to
all
claims
arising
from...
i'm
trying
to
find
the
specific
language.
mr.
david
d.
cole
with...
yes.
mr.
david
d.
cole
right.
it's
on
page
18a,
shall
apply
without
limitation
to
claims
arising
from
all
past,
pending,
or
future
exclusion,
deportation,
or
removal
proceedings
under
such
act.
so
the
government
says
that
means
congress
intended
one
and
only
one
provision
of
1252
to
apply
to
pending
proceedings.
we
think
that
reading
is
untenable
for
a
number
of
reasons.
first,
it's
inconsistent
with
309(c),
which
says
that
pending
proceedings
are
covered
by
the
old
law
subject
only
to
the
exceptions
in
the
succeeding
provisions,
of
which
(g)
is
not
one.
second,
when
you
apply
(g)
without
the
rest
of
1252
it
becomes
not
an
exclusion,
an
exclusive
jurisdiction
provision,
as
it
is
denominated
in
the
statute,
but
a
nullification
of
all
jurisdictional
statutes,
because
it
says,
except
as
provided
in
this
section,
which
the
government
concedes
doesn't
apply,
and
notwithstanding
any
other
provision
of
law,
no
court
shall
have
jurisdiction
to
hear
any
of
these
claims,
so
it
becomes
a
nullification
provision--
mr.
david
d.
cole
--well,
first
of
all,
it
requires
reading
1252(g),
which
says
that
judicial
review
may
not
be
based
on
any
other
provision
of
law...
you
have
to
ignore
that
language
and
say
judicial
review
may
be
based
on
1105a.
then
you
have
to
take
1105a,
which
says,
judicial
review
under
1105a
in
the
court
of
appeals
must
be
determined
solely
upon
the
administrative
record,
and
you--
mr.
david
d.
cole
--and
you
have
to
read
that...
so
the
government...
the
government
requires
you
to
read
the...
two
statutes
exactly
against
their
meaning,
and
to
adopt
an
interpretation
that
congress--
mr.
david
d.
cole
--well,
i
think...
no,
but
i
think
a
better
option,
justice
breyer...
i
think
a
better
option
is
the
option
this
court
took
in
mcnary,
which
is
to
say,
when
congress
says
that
an
exclusive
review
scheme
is
limited
to
the
administrative
record,
it
does
not
intend
claims
that
require
fact
findings
beyond
the
administrative
record
to
be
encompassed
within
that
exclusive--
mr.
david
d.
cole
--justice
scalia,
there
is
no
indication
that
congress
was
concerned
about
our
case
or
cases
of
our--
mr.
david
d.
cole
--i--
mr.
david
d.
cole
--well,
and
the
irony
here
is
that
we're
the
ones
who
are
seeking
expeditious
resolution,
chief
justice
rehnquist.
it's
the
government
that
is
seeking
delay.
if
you
rule
for
the
government
in
this
case,
we're
talking
about
5,
6,
7,
8
more
years
of
litigation
before
we
ever
get
to
the
question
that
our
clients
went
to
court
for
initially,
which
is,
can
we
distribute
magazines
without
fear
of
the
government
targeting
us.
mr.
david
d.
cole
because
the
government
took
9
years--
mr.
david
d.
cole
--without
any
injunction
in
this
case,
the
government
took
9
years
to
complete
one
quarter
of
the
lead
deportation
hearing
in
this
case,
so
it's
not...
and
we
have
been
seeking...
at
every
stage,
your
honor,
we
have
been
seeking
to
get
a
expeditious
resolution
of
this
case.
the
government
has
been
delaying.
the
government--
mr.
david
d.
cole
--that's
right.
mr.
david
d.
cole
what
the
government
wants
to
do
is
to
delay
the
first
amendment
question
in
the
case,
and
i
think
if
any
other
administrative
agency
targeted
a
u.s.
citizen,
held
a
press
conference...
for
any
kind
of
initiational
proceedings,
and
said...
held
a
press
conference
and
said,
we
don't
care
what
the
technical
charges
are
that
we
brought,
we
don't...
the
irs
says,
we're
auditing
these
people,
but
we
don't
care
about
the
technical
charges.
the
reason
we're
auditing
this
newspaper
is
because
it
published
pro
republican
editorials.
now,
is
there...
do
we
have
any
doubt
that
that
newspaper
could
not
go
into
court
and
seek
an
injunction
against
that
action
even
in
a
situation--
mr.
david
d.
cole
--that's
right,
but
newspapers
can
have
their
first
amendment
rights
chilled,
and
so
can
immigrants,
the--
mr.
david
d.
cole
--and--
mr.
david
d.
cole
--that's
true,
your
honor,
but
what
we're
talking
about
is
a
principle
that
says
that
first
amendment
claims
require
prompt
review,
that
the
uncertainty
about
whether
or
not
you
have
the
right
to
engage
in
a
particular
type
of
speech
or
association
means
that
you
will
not
engage
in
that
association
or
speech.
that
is
what
has
happened
to
our
clients.
for
that
reason,
we
didn't
wait
until
the
end
of
the
deportation
proceeding.
we
went
right
into
court,
we
sought
a
resolution.
it's
the
government
that
has
strung
this
out.
they
brought
two
separate
appeals,
raising
claims,
all
the
claims
on
the
second
appeal
that
they
could
have
raised
on
the
first
appeal.
they
have
objected
to
discovery.
they
have
taken
us
up
on
mandamuses
to
the
court
of
appeals
on
virtually
every
issue.
we've
been
seeking...
we've
been
seeking
expeditious
resolution,
and
the
reason,
your
honor,
is
that
although
it
is
true
that
in
many
cases
delay
is
in
the
interests
of
the
alien,
in
a
case
where
the
government
has
said
that
we're
bringing
these
proceedings
because
we
want
to
chill
your
political
activities,
it's
in
the
interests
of
these
aliens
and,
indeed,
of
all
aliens
to
know
whether
they
have--
mr.
david
d.
cole
--what
the
government
said
is,
the
fbi
report
which
urged
the
ins
to
bring
this
case
said,
deport
these
people
because
it
would
disrupt
the
activities
of
this
group,
activities
which
include
distributing
magazines,
et
cetera,
et
cetera.
they
said
with
respect
to
khader
hamide,
one
of
the
individuals,
they
said,
we
think
you
should
seek
his
deportation
not
because
he's
engaged
in
any
illegal
conduct,
but
because
he
is
intelligent
and
shows
great
leadership
ability,
and
therefore
going
after
him
will
hamper
the
activities
of
the
organization.
mr.
david
d.
cole
we
cannot
bring...
we
tried,
your
honor.
the
government
said,
you
can't,
you
have
to
go
to
district
court,
the
bia
agreed,
and
that
was
consistent--
mr.
david
d.
cole
--on
the
ground
that
the
statutory
and
regulatory
authority
of
the
immigration
judge
is
limited
to
determining
whether
the
charges
of
deportability
are
well
founded,
and
he
is
not
allowed
to
look
behind
the
charges
at
the
motives
of
the
district
director
who
brought
the
proceedings.
mr.
david
d.
cole
that
is
the...
has
been
the
accepted
law,
the
agency's
interpretation
for
years
and
years.
no
one
has
challenged
it.
we
sought
to
challenge
it
because
what
we
wanted
was
a
quick
resolution
of
this.
they
said
you
have
to
go
to
district
court.
when
we
won
in
district
court,
now
they're
saying
you
have
to
wait
and
go
to
the
court
of
appeals,
so
it's
the
government--
mr.
david
d.
cole
--well--
mr.
david
d.
cole
--justice
scalia,
in
the--
mr.
david
d.
cole
--there
have
been
three
such
claims
over
the
history
of
the
immigration
act,
so
i
don't
think
you're
going
to
see
a
flood
of
litigation.
secondly,
this
court...
as
this
court
is
well
aware--
mr.
david
d.
cole
--john
lennon,
the
former
beatle,
charged
that
he
was
being
selectively
deported
for...
on
a
drug
offense.
the
second
circuit
recognized
that
that
would
be
a
legitimate
claim
but
ended
up
resolving
his...
his
claim
was...
ended
up
getting
resolved
in
another
way.
and
then
a
man
named
adamay
hernandez
in
the
ninth
circuit
made
a
selective
enforcement
claim,
but
he
had...
he
put
forward
no
evidence
and
it
was
just
dismissed
outright.
but
this
court
has
made
it
very
clear
that
selective
enforcement
claims
are
extremely
difficult
to
get
past
first
base
on,
and
they
are
dismissed
all
the
time.
there
has
not
been
a
successful
selective
prosecution
claim
in
the
federal
courts
for
years.
there's
not...
this
is
the
only
successful
selective
prosecution
claim
that
there's
ever
been
in
an
immigration
case,
so
you're
not
talking
about
some
loophole
that's
going
to
make
it
possible
for
every
immigrant
to
go
in.
what
you're
talking
about
is
when
the
government
has
admitted
that
it
targeted
people
for
their
political
activities,
that
it
doesn't
care
what
the
charges
are,
it
wants
to
get
rid
of
them
because
of
their
political
activities,
and
it
wants
to
disrupt
those
political
activities,
which
the
government
has
also
conceded
are
not
criminal
or
illegal
in
any
way,
in
that
kind
of
a
case,
it's
an
extraordinary
case,
certainly
the
federal
courts
should
be
open
to
allow
an
immigrant
to
get
a--
mr.
david
d.
cole
--well,
the
problem
is
that
the
one
proceeding
that
the
ins
has
put
us
in
cannot
consider
these
claims.
the
court
of
appeals,
according
to
the
ins'
longstanding
interpretation
and
every
interpretation
of
the
act
prior
to
the
'96
act
can't
consider
that
claim,
and
congress
specifically
thought
about
whether
the
court
of
appeals
should
be
given
the
right
to
consider
that
claim
in
passing
the
provision
with
respect
to
constitutional
claims
involving
fact
finding,
and
they
rejected
it
and
instead
adopted
language
that
says
you
can't
go
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
this
kind
of
claim.
and
as
this
court
has
said,
it
is
a
cardinal
principle
of
statutory
construction
that
the
court
can't
adopt
something
that
congress
has
rejected
in
the
process
of
enacting
another
statute.
in
addition,
the...
it
is
quite
clear
that
the
background
against
which
congress
was
acting...
congress
is
presumed
to
know
the
law
just
as
citizens
are...
was
that
these
kinds
of
claims
were
brought
in
district
court.
they
could
not
be
brought
in
the
court
of
appeals.
they
had
to
be
brought
in
district
court.
so
against
that
background--
mr.
david
d.
cole
--well,
there's
only
two
prior...
justice
ginsburg,
there
are
only
two
prior
selective
prosecution
cases.
there
has
been
other
types
of
claims,
challenges
to
immigration
practices
that
require
fact
finding
beyond
the
administrative
record.
mcnary
was
one.
there
are
a
number
of
other
sort
of
pattern
and
practice
class
actions.
but
again,
it's
a
handful
of
cases
out
of
hundreds
of
thousands
of
deportation
proceedings.
this
is
not
some
huge
problem,
and
i
think
it's
because
it's
not
some
huge
problem
that
congress,
while
considering
changing
the
law,
decided
to
maintain
the
law,
and
that
result,
i
think,
is
required
not
only
by
this
court's
general
principles
of
statutory
construction,
but
by
the
principle
of
administrative
law
that
justice
breyer
articulated
on
the
government's
argument.
that
is
that,
where
collateral
claims
are
at
issue
that
the
agency
has
no
expertise
to
address
and
irreparable
injury
is
at
stake,
even
where
the
statute
says
you
have
to
wait
till
the
end
of
the
process,
this
court
has
consistently
said
you
can
go
to
district
court.
and
secondly,
this
court
has
repeatedly
said
in
the
first
amendment
area
that
because
uncertainty
about
one's
rights
chills
those
rights,
prompt
judicial
determination
is
necessary,
under
the
finality
rules
of
1257--
mr.
david
d.
cole
--justice
stevens--
mr.
david
d.
cole
--justice
stevens,
i
think
it's
fair
to
say
that
the
chill
here
is
real.
the
ins
holds
substantial
discretion
over
an
alien
who's
in
deportation
proceedings.
it
can
decide
to
continue
the
proceedings,
or
drop
the
proceedings.
it
can
decide
to
detain
the
person
in
their
discretion.
it
can
decide
to
add
new
charges
in
their
discretion,
as
it
has
done
with
respect
to
all
the
aliens
here.
it
can
decide
to
deny
discretionary
relief
in
its
discretion.
so
the...
a
rational
alien
who
knows
that
he's
been
targeted
for
his
political
activities,
that
similarly
situated
aliens
have
not
even
been
put
into
proceedings,
will
assume
that
if
he
continues
to
engage
in
the
activity
that
the
government
has
said
it
does
not
like,
that
discretion
will
be
used
in
his
disfavor,
just
as
if
the
irs
announced
that
they
were
auditing
a
newspaper
because
of
its
republican
editorials,
and
they
were
auditing
them
for
1
year,
you'd
say,
well,
how's
that
going
to
affect
the
newspaper,
because
the
audit
is
only
with
respect
to
that
past
year.
well,
the
irs
has
a
lot
of
discretion
about
what
it
does
with
an
audit,
it
could
bring
future
audits,
and
so
the
newspaper
will
be
chilled
until
the
court
says
that
it
has
the
right
to
speak.
mr.
david
d.
cole
thank
you.
mr.
stewart,
you
have
2
minutes
remaining.
