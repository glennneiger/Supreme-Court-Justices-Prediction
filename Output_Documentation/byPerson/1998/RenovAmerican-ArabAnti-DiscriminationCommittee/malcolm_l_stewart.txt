mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court--
congress
has
legislated
repeatedly
to
streamline
the
process
by
which
decisions
concerning
the
admission
and
removal
of
aliens
are
reviewed
in
the
courts.
consolidation
of
judicial
review
and
avoidance
of
piecemeal
litigation
have
been
integral
features
of
past
legislative
measures.
the
1996
immigration
reform
statute
is
congress'
most
recent
effort
to
achieve
those
goals.
our
position
in
the
present
case,
however,
does
not
depend
on
the
existence
of
any
special
rule
for
immigration
matters.
rather,
as
applied
here
the
effect
of
the
1996
act
is
simply
to
reaffirm
the
generally
applicable
rule
that
the
filing
of
administrative
charges
is
not
a
final
agency
action
subject
to
immediate
judicial
review.
indeed,
if
respondents
have
identified
no
case,
either
in
the
immigration
context
or
otherwise,
in
which
a
court
has
entertained
a
constitutional
challenge
to
an
agency's
decision
to
commence
administrative
proceedings.
dismissal
of--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--if
the
statutory
scheme
altogether
precluded
judicial
review,
that
is
not
only
at
the
present
time
but
after
the
entry
of
a
final
order
of
deportation--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--the
court
has
held
that
preclusion
of
all
judicial
review
would
raise
a
serious
constitutional
question.
that's
not
the
same
thing
as--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--well,
we
certainly
know
that
there
has
always...
both
before
and
after
the
1996
act
there
has
been
a
provision
authorizing
a
petition
for
review
in
the
court
of
appeals
after
the
entry
of
a
final
order
of
deportation,
and
i
think
there's
general
agreement
that
a
petition
for
review--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--and
if
the...
if
there
were
ultimately
final
orders
of
deportation
entered,
and
the
respondents
raised
a
constitutional
challenge
based
on
selective
enforcement,
and
if
the
court
of
appeals
then
concluded
that
fact
finding
was
necessary
in
order
to
resolve
the
constitutional
issue,
it
would
then
be
required
to
determine
whether
a
mechanism
existed
under
the
applicable
statute.
now,
we
believe
28
u.s.c.
2347(b)(3)
would
provide
that
mechanism,
but--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--i
think
it
would
be
properly
raised
in
the
sense
that
the
respondents
would
claim
that
execution
of...
if
the
respondents
claimed
that
execution
of
the
deportation
order
would
violate
their
constitutional
rights
because
the
charges
were
initiated
on
the
basis
of
unconstitutional
considerations,
i
think
that
is
a
claim
that
would
properly
be
before
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
that
is
correct.
that
is
not
to
say
that
we
would
concede
either
in
the
present
case
or
in
any
other
case
that
fact
finding
actually
is
required
in
order
to
determine
the
merits
of
the
claim.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
that's
correct.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
that's
correct.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
well,
habeas
corpus
under
the
former
statutory
scheme
was
only
in
cases
of
orders
of
exclusion.
it
wouldn't
have
applied
to
orders
of
deportation.
if--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--well,
if
and
when
the
aliens
were
held
in
custody
that
would
be--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--well,
the
only...
the
basis
for...
if
you
look
at
page
1a
of
the
appendix
to
the
government's
brief,
former
section
1105a(a)
was...
it's
entitled
generally
judicial
review
of
orders
of
deportation
and
exclusion,
and
it
says,
exclusiveness
of
procedure,
and
then
it
says,
the
procedure
prescribed
by
and
all
the
provisions
of
chapter
158
of
title
28,
which
is
the
hobbs
act,
says,
shall
apply
to
and
shall
be
the
sole
and
exclusive
procedure
for
the
judicial
review
of
all
final
orders
of
deportation
heretofore
or
hereafter
made
against
aliens
within
the
united
states.
and
as
the
legislative
history
of
the
1961
amendments
to
the
immigration
and
nationality
act
make
clear,
that
provision
was
enacted
in
1961
to
replace
a
former
system
under
which
multiple
avenues
of
review
had
been
available
for
challenge
by
orders
of
deportation.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
i
would
assume
that
would
address
the
situation
in
which
the
alien
challenged
the
detention
itself,
perhaps
because
it
was
prolonged,
rather
than
challenging
the
validity
of
the
final
order
of
deportation,
because
as
i
say
the
legislative
history
of
the
1961
amendments
to
the
ina
indicate
that
the
provision
for
hobbs
act
review
in
the
court
of
appeals
was
specifically
intended
to
replace
prior
duplicative
avenues
of
review.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
i
think
that
is
correct
looking
at
that
provision
in
isolation,
but
i
think
that
provision
is
viewed
in
conjunction
with
(a)(1),
which
says
specifically
that
judicial
review
in
the
court
of
appeals
under
the
hobbs
act
is
the
only
means
of
challenging
the
final
order
of
deportation
itself.
and
again,
one
of
the
things
i'd
emphasize
is
that
uncertainty
as
to
what
precisely
would
be
the
proper
avenue
for
reviewing
the
final
order
of
deportation
really
shouldn't
distract
the
court
from
the
question
of
whether
the
instant
suit
was
properly
commenced.
that
is,
even
though
there
might
be
some
disagreement
between
the
parties
as
to
precisely
how
a
judicial
review
of
the
final
order
would
be
carried
out,
i
think
there
is
a
common
agreement
that
final
orders
of
deportation
are
judicially
reviewable.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
it
might
influence...
i
think
to
take
a
worst
case
scenario
from
the
government's
standpoint,
if
the
court
believed
that
congress
had
unambiguously
foreclosed
all
judicial
review
of
respondents'...
of
selective
enforcement
claims
either
before
or
after
the
entry
of
a
final
order,
and
if
the
court
held
that
respondents
were
constitutionally
entitled
to
judicial
review
so
that
the
deprivation
of
all
review
would
be
a
constitutional
violation,
the
court
would
then
have
to
determine
what
the
proper
remedy
was,
and
we
would
submit
that
it
is
much
more
consistent
with
the
overall
scheme
of
the
immigration
statute
and
with
general
principles
of
administrative
law
that
review
be
provided
at
the
end
of
the
process.
again,
we're
not
asking
for
a
special
rule
for
immigration
cases,
but
just--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--yes,
because
there
would
not
be
a
hearing
with
respect
to
the
issues.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
i
don't
know
that
it
would
be
appropriate
for
a
current
department
of
justice
employee
ever
to
purport
absolutely
to
bind
future
department
of
justice
employees.
certainly,
if
the
court
wrote
an
opinion
saying
that
the
instant
suit
was
barred
based
on
its
reading
of
the
statute
to
allow
a
judicial
review
at
the
end
of
the
day,
the
court's
opinion
would
give
the
respondents
the
necessary
assurance
that
review
would
ultimately
be
available,
whatever
the
binding
effect
of
my
representation
might
be.
and
again,
the
other
point
i
want
to
make
is,
if
it...
if
the
court
at
the
end
of
the
day
concluded
that
section
2347(b)(3)
simply
was
unambiguously
unavailable
to
the
aliens,
and
that
there
was...
and
if
the
court
further
concluded
that
the
aliens
were
constitutionally
entitled
to
judicial
review
of
their
selective
enforcement
claims
such
that
a
denial
of
fact
finding
would
be
a
constitutional
violation,
the
obvious
remedy
would
be
for
the
court
to
fashion
an
appropriate
mechanism
similar
to
the
section
2347(b)(3)
transfer.
that
seems
to
us
a
remedy
for
a
hypothetical
violation
that
is
far
more
in
keeping,
again,
both
with
the
overall
structure
of
the
immigration
laws--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--i
think
if
the
court
concluded
that
there
is
a
serious
constitutional
doubt,
then
it
would
presumably
make
every
effort
to
read
the
statute
in
order
to
allow
for
such
review,
and
i
think
whether
or
not
our
reading
of
the
statute
is
the
one
that
the
court
would
consider
to
be
the
better
one,
our
reading
is
certainly
reasonable
enough
that
a
court
could
in
good
conscience
adopt
it
in
order
even
to
assuage
a
serious
constitutional
doubt.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
and
here
it's
not
simply...
i
think
that's
right,
but
here
it's
not
simply
the
particular
issue,
it
is
the
particular
action,
namely
the
filing
of
charges.
at
the
end
of
the
day,
the
selective
enforcement
claim
would
be
a
challenge
to
the
decision
to
bring
charges
in
the
first
instance.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
i
think
we
can
make
that
assumption.
that
is,
the
immigration
judge
and
the
board
of
immigration
appeals
are
not
authorized
to
adjudicate
claims
of
selective
enforcement.
now,
it
is
possible
that
in
the
course
of
trying
the
deportation
charges
evidence
would
emerge
that
would
be
relevant
to
the
final
resolution
of
the
selective
enforcement
claims,
but
i
think
it's
correct
we
can't
count
on
that
happening.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
well,
i
mean,
i
think
in
a
sense
your
question
depends
upon
the
empirical
premise
that
if
somebody
files
a
lawsuit
alleging
selective
enforcement,
that
lawsuit
is
likely
to
be
finally
resolved
before
the
deportation
proceeding
would
be
resolved
if
the
matter
went
forward
in
that
manner,
so
i
don't
know
that
it's
necessarily
the
case
that
allowing
an
immediate
selective
enforcement
challenge
would
speed
up
ultimate
resolution
of
the
first
amendment
issue.
but
the
second
point
we
would
make
is
that
there
is
no
constitutional
right
to
immediate
adjudication
of
first
amendment
claims
simply
to
eliminate
subjective
uncertainty
as
to
what
a
person's
rights
are.
that
is,
here,
the
respondents
do
envision
a
potential
concrete
harm,
namely
the
ultimate
entry
of
a
final
order
of
deportation
against
them,
which
they
say
would
be
in
violation
of
their
first
amendment
rights.
but
to
the
extent
that
they're
worried
about
that
harm,
they
clearly
have
an
adequate
remedy,
because
they
can
file
a
petition
for
review
of
the
final
order
of
deportation
itself.
the
only
harm
that
they're
suffering
in
the
interim
is
subjective
uncertainty
as
to
what
the
state
of
the
law
is,
exactly
what
they
can
do,
which
they
characterize
as
chill,
and--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--i
think
we
are
accepting
there
is
such
a
thing
as
a
selective
enforcement
claim.
i
don't
think
we
would
accept
the
principle
that
whenever
a
selective
enforcement
claim
is
made
out
the
automatic
remedy
would
be
vacatur
of
the
final
order
of
deportation.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
that's
correct.
i
mean,
in
the
present
case,
at
the
time
the
initial
deportation
charges
were
filed
the
mccarran
walter
act
made
membership
in
various
forms
of
hostile
organizations
a
separate
and
independent
ground
for
deportation,
so
the
very
basis
of
selectivity
that
the
respondents
claim
was
constitutionally
impermissible
was
itself
recognized
by
congress
as
a
valid
basis
upon
which
deportation
decisions
could
be
made.
so
while
we
could
imagine
extreme
situations
such
as
the
agency
deciding
solely
on
the
basis
of
race
to
file
charges
against
one
person
and
not
another,
it
doesn't
follow
that
what
might
be
an
impermissible
basis
of
selection
in
other
contexts
would
be
an
impermissible
basis
for
selection
in
the--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--i
don't
remember
any
right
now.
i
know
that
there
was
a
challenge
brought
by
a
mr.
rafidi
in
the
d.c.
circuit
that
was
a
challenge
to
the
processing
of
his
deportation
charges
or
exclusion
charges.
i
don't
remember
whether
that
included
a
claim
of
selective
enforcement.
there
has
certainly
not
been
a
history
of
frequent
claims
of
selective
enforcement.
i
think
part
of
the
reason
for
that
is
that
people
understand
that
immigration
officials
have
very
wide
discretion,
that
matters
regarding
the
admission
and
the
ultimate
removal
of
aliens
are
largely
entrusted
to
the
political
branches,
and
therefore
people
understand
that
bases
for
selection
that
might
appear
unwarranted
in
other
contexts
would
not
be
valid
grounds
for
constitutional
claims
in
the
deportation
context.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
approximately,
a
little
over
11
1/2
years.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
the
situation
has
changed.
we
have
referred
to
the
eight
respondents
as
the
six
and
the
two.
the
two
are
hamide
and
shehadeh,
and
they
are
permanent
resident
aliens
as
to
whom
the
deportation
charges
are
actually
based
upon
the
terrorist
activity,
the
support
of
the
pflp.
with
respect
to
the
six,
actual
charges
were
based
on
routine
status
violations,
overstaying
a
visit,
failure
to
maintain
student
status,
and
the
allegation
was
that
we
would
not
have
pursued
those
charges
but
for
there
are
ties
to
the
pflp.
with
respect
to
two
of
the
six,
two
of
the
six
have
obtained
legalization,
and
consequently
they
would
not...
they
would
no
longer
be
subject
to
the
routine
status
violations,
so
in
a
sense
their
claim
of
selective
enforcement
is
moot.
now,
as
the
respondents'
counsel
has
pointed
out,
there
does
remain
at
least
a
theoretical
possibility
that
we
could
seek
to
deport
them
based
upon
the
actual
affiliation
with
the
pflp,
and
in
that
sense
it's
not
altogether
out
of
the
question
that
the
issues
raised
by
this
case
could
affect
them,
but--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--that's
correct.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
that's
correct.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
that's
correct,
which
starts
at
the
bottom
of
page--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--17a.
that's
correct.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
that's
correct.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
well--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--that--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--that's
correct.
now,
with
respect
to
cases
in
which
deportation
proceedings
are
commenced
after
the
effective
date
of
the
act,
the
phrase,
except
as
provided
in
this
section,
can
be
given
its
literal
meaning.
that
is,
the
only
judicial
review
that
will
be
available
is
judicial
review
under
new
8
u.s.c.
1252,
which
is
entitled,
judicial
review
of
orders
of
removal.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
it
requires
final
order
of
deportation.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
it
can't
be
given
that
meaning
with
respect
to
the
transition
cases.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
because
if
you
look
at
the
transition
provisions,
which
are
on
page...
the
bottom
of
page
18a
and
the
top
of
page
19a
of
the
government's
brief,
it
says,
general
rule
that
new
rules
do
not
apply.
subject
to
the
succeeding
provisions
of
this
subsection,
in
the
case
of
an
alien
who
is
in
exclusion
or
deportation
proceedings
before
the
title
3(a)
effective
date,
the
amendments
made
by
this
subtitle
shall
not
apply,
and
the
proceedings,
including
judicial
review
thereof,
shall
continue
to
be
conducted
with
regard
to
such
amendments.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
without...
i'm
sorry,
without
regard
to
such
amendments,
which
means
that
if
and
when
a
final
order
of
deportation
is
entered
against
these
respondents,
pursuant
to
the
transition
rule
provisions,
judicial
review
of
the
final
order
of
deportation
would
be
conducted
pursuant
to
former
8
u.s.c.
1105a.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
well,
(g)
by
itself
would
not
necessarily
be
given
that
meaning,
but
if
you
look
at
the
middle
of
page
18--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--i
mean,
i
think
that
1252(g)
is
not
intended
to
provide
a
mechanism
for
judicial
review.
it's
simply
to
make
clear
that
particular
types
of
claims
can't
be
brought
other
than
through
the
mechanism
provided
in
the
ina
itself.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
no.
i
think
whether
or
not
the
language
was
artful,
i
think
that
the
intent
was
to
run
the
gamut
and
to
say
anything
having
to
do
with--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--the
conduct
of
outcome
of--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--well,
i--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--but
i
think
what
was
happening
is
that
former
8
u.s.c.
1105a,
the
old
judicial
review
provision,
said,
this
is
the
exclusive
review
provision
for
final
orders
of
deportation,
and
that
left
us
open
to
the
claim
that
if
what
you
were
challenging
was
not
the
final
order
of
deportation
itself,
but
some
preliminary
stage
along
the
way,
that
was
not
literally
covered
by
the
language
of
1105a.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
that's
exactly
the
way
that
we
would
read
it,
and
we--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--i
think
even
if
you
read
the
provision
more
narrowly
than
we
would,
it
certainly
applies
to
this
case,
because
it
applies
to--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--no,
i
think
that's
correct.
i
think--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--no,
that's
correct.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
well,
because
the--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--i
mean,
we
would
certainly
have
no
objection
with
saying...
and
one
of
the
things
i
would
emphasize
is
that
the
ambiguity
here
is
not
in
our
view
about
whether
the
instant
suit
should
be
removed.
it's
about
precisely
how
the
review
proceedings
will
be--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--i
don't
think
we
have
309,
but
i
think
we
have
former
8
u.s.c.
11--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--well,
309
i
think
does
affect
our
reading
of
(g),
because
it
says
the
amendments
made
by
this
subtitle,
which
include
the
new
8
u.s.c.
1252,
shall
not
apply
to
judicial
review
of
final
orders
of
deportation
entered
in
cases
that
were
pending
on
the
act's
effective
date.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
i
mean,
we
would
be
perfectly
happy
with
that
reading--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--that's
correct,
and...
well,
309
would
still
govern,
because
309
would
say,
review
will
ultimately
be
conducted
without
regard
to
the
1996
a...
act,
namely,
under
former
8
u.s.c.
1105a.
i
mean,
in
a
sense,
the
view
you're
postulating
gets
us
to
the
same
place,
in
that
the
ultimate
result
is,
if
and
when
there's
a
final
order,
review
will
be
under
1105a,
and
your
reading
is
a
way
of
eliminating
the
textual
ambiguity
in
the
phrase,
except
in
this
section.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
right.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
that's
correct.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
i
think
the
problem
with
it
is
that
(f)(1)
is
not
itself
an
authorization
of
judicial
review.
it
is
phrased
as
a
limit
on
injunctive
relief.
it
doesn't
identify
any
character...
any
category
of
cases
as
being
subject
to
review
in
the
district
courts.
whether
it's
message
is,
even
if
a
case
is
properly
under
review,
the
relief
shall
not
extend
beyond
the
alien
who's
actually
been
in
proceedings,
so
the
essence
is,
no
class
wide
relief,
even
if
a
court
of
appeals
in
an
individual
case
concludes
that
a
statutory
provision,
for
instance,
is
unconstitutional,
the
only
relief
would
be
to
set
aside
the
order
of
deportation
in
that
case
rather
than
to
enter
an
injunction
against
applying
that
provision
to
other
aliens.
if
i--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--i
think
the
court
has
said
that
exhaustion
requirements
will
often
be
construed
not
to
apply
in
such
a
way
as
to
create
the
potential
for
irreparable
harm.
i
don't
think
the
court
has
said
that
there
is
a
constitutional
right
to
come
into
court
immediately,
whenever
you
can
show--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--i
mean,
i
think...
i
think
because
1252(g)
unambiguously
bars
a
suit,
an
immediate
suit
challenging
the
commencement
of
proceedings,
the
court
could
order
the
agency
to
waive
that
protection
only
if
the
court
held
that
the
respondents
were
constitutionally
entitled
to
an
immediate
review
of
their
claims,
and
even
upon
your
hypothesis
that
there
would
be
irreparable
injury,
we
wouldn't
agree
that
there
is
a
constitutional
entitlement
to
an
immediate
judicial
forum.
if
i
may,
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
i
guess
the
first
legal
point
i
would
want
to
make
is
that
we
certainly
disagree
with
the
contention
that
prior
to
the
enactment
of
the
1996
statute
there
was
a
consistent
practice
of
allowing
claims
like
this
to
go
forward.
the
respondents
have
not
identified
any
case
in
which
a
court
has
entertained
a
selective
enforcement
challenge
to
the
filing
of
deportation
charges.
that
would
have
been
inconsistent
with
well
established
principles
of
administrative
law
that
the
filing
of
charges
is
not
final
agency
action.
cases
like
cheng
fan
kwok
are
cases
in
which
the
court
has
reviewed
actions
that
took
place
outside
the
deportation
process
itself
and
has
held
that
those
were
not
subject
to
the
exclusive
review
provision
of
former
section
1105a,
but
to
say
that
simply
by
challenging
a
nonfinal
action
an
individual
can
have
his
claim
heard
immediately
really
is
not
consistent
with
administrative
law
principles.
the
second
point
is
that
what
is
revealed
pervasively
in
the
fbi
reports
is
a
concern
that
the
respondents
were
assisting
in
the
raising
of
funds
for
a
foreign
terrorist
organization.
certainly,
in
the
course
of
surveilling
the
respondents
the
fbi
came
upon
other
pflp
related
activity
other
than
the
pure
raising
of
funds,
but
the
court
concern
was
with
fundraising,
so
this
is
very
far
afield
from
core
first
amendment
activity.
and
the
last
point
i'd
like
to
make
is
that
for
respondents
to
claim
that
they
have
attempted
at
every
turn
to
seek
expeditious
resolution
of
this
process
is
simply
untenable.
the
respondents
have
sought
repeatedly
to
get
district
court
injunctions
against
the
ongoing
deportation
proceedings,
they
have
sought
successfully
to
have
stays
entered
in
the
immigration
court
itself
to
have
the
proceedings
put
on
hold
until
the
conclusion
of
the
litigation.
there's
nothing
wrong
with
their
doing
it,
but
i
think
the
respondents
have
acted
throughout
the
proceedings
on
the
assumption
that
their
clients'
interests
are
served
by
protraction
of
the
proceedings
rather
than
by
speedy
resolution.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
i
don't
fault
them
for
that.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
i--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--that's
correct.
i
don't
fault
them
for
that.
my
point
is
simply
that
having
acted
on
the
assumption
that
their
interests
are
served
by
having
the
deportation
proceedings
take
as
long
as
possible...
thank
you.
