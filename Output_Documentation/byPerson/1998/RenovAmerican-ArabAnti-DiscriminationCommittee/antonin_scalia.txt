justice
antonin
scalia
this
case
comes
to
us
on
certiorari
from
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit.
the
facts
are
as
follows:
in
1987,
the
immigration
and
naturalization
service
instituted
deportation
proceedings
against
eight
aliens
who
belong
to
the
popular
front
for
the
liberation
of
palestine.
a
group
that
the
government
characterizes
as
an
international
terrorist
and
communist
organization.
the
ins
charged
six
of
the
aliens
with
routine
status
violations,
such
as
overstaying
of
visa
and
failure
to
maintain
student
status.
it
charged
the
other
two
with
membership
in
a
group
advocating
terrorism.
all
eight
aliens
immediately
filed
suit
against
the
ins
arguing
that
they
had
been
unconstitutionally
singled
out
for
deportation
because
of
their
affiliation
with
a
politically
unpopular
group.
after
several
years
of
litigation,
the
district
court
ultimately
enjoined
deportation
proceeding
against
the
aliens.
while
the
attorney
general's
appeal
of
that
injunction
was
pending,
congress
passed
the
immigration
reform
and
immigration
responsibility
act
of
1966
known
as
iirira.
the
96
that
i
say
76,
whatever
--
it
was
96
--
and
the
attorney
general
argued
that
a
provision
of
that
act
codified
at
8
u.s.c.
section
1252(g)
deprived
the
federal
court
of
jurisdiction
over
the
alien
suit.
the
ninth
circuit
disagreed
and
it
upheld
jurisdiction
and
affirmed
the
merits
of
the
district
court's
injunction.
we
reverse
the
ninth
circuit.
section
1252(g),
unlike
the
rest
of
iirira,
is
immediately
applicable
to
aliens
who
were
in
deportation
proceedings
on
irrira's
effective
date.
the
section
states
that
review
of
three
discrete
actions
that
the
attorney
general
may
take,
are
decision
or
action
to
commence
proceedings,
to
adjudicate
cases,
or
to
execute
removal
orders
against
any
alien
is
available
only
as
provided
elsewhere
in
section
1252.
the
alien
selective-enforcement
claims
squarely
challenged
the
attorney
general's
decision
to
commence
proceedings
against
them
and
nothing
elsewhere
in
1252
gives
the
federal
courts
jurisdiction
over
their
claims.
accordingly,
judicial
review
of
the
commencement
of
these
proceedings
is
not
available.
the
aliens
argued
that
the
doctrine
of
constitutional
doubt
requires
us
to
interpret
section
1252
in
such
fashion
as
to
permit
immediate
review
of
their
selective-enforcement
claims.
the
doctrine
of
constitutional
doubt
is
the
venerable
principle
of
interpretation,
which
says
that
if
there
is
any
ambiguity
in
a
statute,
it
should
be
interpreted
in
such
manner
as
to
avoid
serious
constitutional
questions.
serious
constitutional
question
the
aliens
assert
is
at
issue
here
is
the
deprivation
of
there
constitutional
right,
not
to
have
the
immigration
laws
enforced
against
them
solely
because
of
there
political
beliefs.
they
assert
that
for
reasons,
it
is
unnecessary
to
go
into
here,
if
their
constitutional
right
against
selective-enforcement
is
not
assertable
at
this
stage
in
the
deportation
proceedings,
it
cannot
affectively
be
vindicated
at
all.
since
this
may
well
beyond
constitutional,
they
say,
the
statute
should
be
interpreted
to
permit
them
to
challenge
selective-enforcement
immediately.
we
reject
this
argument
based
on
the
doctrine
of
constitutional
doubt
because
in
our
view
aliens
unlawfully
in
this
country
have
no
constitutional
right
to
assert
a
claim
of
selective
enforcement
as
a
defense
against
deportation.
even
in
ordinary
criminal
prosecutions,
the
defense
of
selected
prosecution
is
rarely
allowed.
in
deportation
proceedings,
such
a
defense
would
be
even
more
intrusive
upon
necessary
executive
confidentiality,
while
at
the
same
time
the
denial
of
the
defense
does
not
subject
the
alien
to
criminal
punishment
but
merely
brings
to
an
end
his
ongoing
violation
of
the
immigration
laws.
we
think
that
an
alien
whose
very
presence
in
this
country
is
unlawful,
may
constitutionally
be
deported
whatever
the
reason
he
happens
to
be
selected
for
deportation.
