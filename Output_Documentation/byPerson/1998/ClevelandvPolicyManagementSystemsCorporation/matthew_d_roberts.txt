mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court--
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
--yes,
the
social
security
administration
doesn't
consider
reasonable
accommodations
that
have
not
been
made.
that's
because
the
question
of
whether
a
reasonable
accommodation
is
necessary
is
very
fact
intensive,
resource
intensive,
and
a
time
consuming
effort,
and
it's
one
about
which
the
social
security
administration
doesn't
have
much
expertise.
therefore,
to
do
it
would
be
detrimental
to
the
efficiency
of
the
program,
and
that
efficiency
is
critical
to
the
program
because
the
administration
handles
about
two
and
a
half
million
claims
a
year,
which
is
about
ten
times
as
many
cases
as
go
in
the
federal
court
system.
in
addition
to
that--
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
--the
social
security
administration
has
interpreted
the
law
to
permit
it
to
consider
the
jobs
as
they
actually
exist
and
the
jobs
as
they
existed.
and
in
addition
to
the
efficiency
reason
that
i
stated
before
to
justice
kennedy,
there
are
additional
reasons,
because
the
purpose
of
the
social
security
act,
which
is
also
a
purpose
of
the
ada,
is
to
try
to
enable
people
to
move
off
the
benefit
rolls
and
return
to
work.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
no,
your
honor,
it
doesn't
close
its
eyes.
it
looks
at
the
jobs
as
they
actually
exist,
as
the
jobs
are
ordinarily
performed
in
the
national
economy
or
as
the
past
job
was
performed.
if
an
employer
had
made
an
accommodation
to
somebody,
then
the
social
security
would
consider
that
as
part
of
their
past
job.
if
the
accommodations
were
routinely
made
in
jobs
in
the
national
economy,
then
the
social
security
administration
would
consider
that.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
yes,
their
disability
benefits
would
terminate
if
the
person
was
performing
substantial
gainful
activity
after--
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
--yes.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
after
the--
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
--yes,
i'm
sorry.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
after
the
trial
work
period,
which
is
nine
months
long,
then
the
benefits
would
cut
off
in
the
third
month
after
that,
although
a
person
would
also
be
entitled
to
benefits
in
any
month
for
the
next
36
months
in
which
their
earnings
fell
below
$500,
which
is
the
level
that
the
social
security--
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
well,
that's
required
by
the
statute,
your
honor,
and
the
purpose
of
that
provision
in
the
statute
is
to
enable
people
to
test
their
ability
to
return
to
work.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
congress
certainly
intended
the
possibility
of
people
doing
both.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
we
don't
believe
a
presumption
would
be
appropriate,
your
honor,
because--
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
--that
would
mean
that
in
the
borderline
cases
there
would
be
a
risk
that
the
claimant
would
lose,
which
would
be
contrary
to
the
policy
of
the
act
of
encouraging
as
many
people
to
go
back
to
work
as
possible.
but
it's
important
to
realize
that
there's
no
reason--
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
--no,
your
honor.
but
if
people
are
forced
to
choose
between
disability
benefits,
the
chance
to
get
disability
benefits
and
the
chance
to
vindicate
their
rights,
and
those
disability
benefits
may
be
necessary
for
survival,
then
it's
likely
that
many
people
will
choose
the
disability
benefits.
and
if
they
are
the
presumed
to
be
unable
to
bring
an
ada
action,
they
will
be
denied
a
remedy
that
might
enable
them
to
get
back
to
work.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
a
presumption
might
be
appropriate
if
there
was
a
reason
to
believe
that
there
was
an
inconsistency
that
arises
simply
from
the
application
or
the
receipt
of
benefits.
but
there's
no
reason
to
believe
that
there's
that
inconsistency.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
well,
in
40
percent,
42
percent
of
the
cases
that
people
who
had
social
security
disability
benefits
returned
to
work,
their
employer
made
an
accommodation.
so
i
think
that
there
is
evidence
that
it
is
in
a
large
percent
of
cases.
plus
60
percent,
nearly
60
percent
of
social
security
disability
benefit
determinations,
awards,
are
made
at
step
three
of
the
process,
which
is
at
the
state
of
listed
impairments.
and
in
that
case
the
administration
presumes
that
somebody
is
entitled
to
benefits
without
any
inquiry
into
their
ability
to
do
their
past
job
or
their
ability
to
do
other
employment
in
the
national
economy.
in
fact,
many
of
those
impairments
are
impairments
that,
while
most
people
might
not
be
able
to
work,
many
people
could...
blindness,
complete
loss
of
speech
or
loss
of
hearing,
inability
to
use
both
legs.
so
i
would
say
that
there
are
more
than
one
instance
of
reasonable
accommodation.
there
is
also
the
impairment
difference,
there
is
the
trial
work
period
difference
that
justice
o'connor
brought
up.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
they're
both
fairly,
fairly
lengthy
processes,
although
i
would
say
that
probably
the
ada
suit
would
take
longer
to
resolve.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
certainly
the
courts
move
at
different
speeds,
your
honor.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
no,
we
believe
ordinary
summary
judgment
principles
are
adequate
to
deal
with--
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
--to
deal
with
this
situation.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
he
has
the
burden
of
proof.
he
is
the
plaintiff
and
he
has
the
burden
of
proof,
so
he
must
come
forward
with
specific
facts.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
he
has
the...
that
might
be
sufficient
to
deal
with
the
past
statement,
but
he
would
have
the
burden
of
proof
to
show
that
he's
a
qualified
individual
with
disability.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
no.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
no,
your
honor,
it's
not
washed
out.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
it's
a
factor
that
could
be
considered
in
determining
whether
a
reasonable
tryer
of
fact
could
find
for
the
plaintiff.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
yes,
it
would
certainly
be
considered
as
an
admission
against
interest.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
it
could
also
be
considered
to
limit
relief
if
it
was
determined
that
the
plaintiff
prevailed.
