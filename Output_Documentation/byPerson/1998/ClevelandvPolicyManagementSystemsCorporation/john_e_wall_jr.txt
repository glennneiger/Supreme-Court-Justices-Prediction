mr.
john
e.
wall,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
carolyn
cleveland,
a
stroke
victim
with
a
known
perceptive
and
expressive
aphasia,
a
known
language
disruption,
didn't
even
get
a
chance
to
present
her
americans
with
disabilities
act
case,
even
though,
or
even
because,
she
had
applied
for
social
security
disability
benefits.
in
a
case
very
similar
to
mrs.
cleveland's
case,
in
the
mckenna
case,
christine
mckenna,
who
had
committed
various
infractions
in
the
workplace,
got
to
present
her
case,
and
carolyn
cleveland
has
not.
in
fact,
ms.
mckenna
received
more
favorable
treatment
than
mrs.
cleveland
in
the
fact
that
mrs.
mckenna
did
not
have
to
overcome
a
presumption.
mr.
john
e.
wall,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
the
mckenna
case,
as
this
court
is
well
aware,
involved
the
issue
of
after
acquired
evidence.
mr.
john
e.
wall,
jr.
after
acquired
evidence.
mr.
john
e.
wall,
jr.
i
agree,
your
honor.
the
distinction
is
in
our
particular
case
this
evidence,
these
representations,
these
general
statements
that
were
made
by
mrs.
cleveland
to
the
social
security
administration,
were
discovered
after
the
violation
of
the
americans
with
disabilities
act
and
somehow
are
used
to
presumptively
penalize
mrs.
cleveland
from
being
able
to
bring
action.
mr.
john
e.
wall,
jr.
i
certainly
believe
they
should,
your
honor.
mr.
john
e.
wall,
jr.
it
would
be
in
the
sense
that
at
various
points
in
time
she
did
have
to
say,
in
response
to
various
questions
of
the
social
security
administration,
words
of
that
caliber
or
character.
now,
in
our
particular
situation
here
there
was
a
period
of
time,
as
the
court
is
well
aware,
that
mrs.
cleveland
returned
to
work
and
was
physically
capable
of
doing
the
job.
and
had
she
been
accommodated
by
her
employer,
there
would
have
been
no
necessity
to
resurrect
her
social
security
disability
claim.
mr.
john
e.
wall,
jr.
well,
i
would
think
that
that
would
upset
the
normal
summary
judgment
process
here,
being
that
this
is
an
affirmative
defense
raised
by
the
respondent.
it
is
their
burden
to
establish
the
essential
elements
of
their
defense.
mr.
john
e.
wall,
jr.
i
believe
that
she
should
be
required
to
explain
it,
as
we
did.
mr.
john
e.
wall,
jr.
i
think
not,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
john
e.
wall,
jr.
the
reason
being
is
because
people
who
apply
for
social
security
disability
may
be
victims
of
down's
syndrome,
may
be
victims
of
dyslexia,
may
be
victims
of
brain
damage,
may
be
victims
of
strokes,
may
have
expressive
and
perceptive
aphasia,
as
mrs.
cleveland
does,
may
have
any
number
of
other
psychomotor
abnormalities
which
may
interfere
with
their
normal
language
perception.
mr.
john
e.
wall,
jr.
well,
the
process
as
i
understand
it,
mr.
chief
justice,
is
that
this
initial
application
that
was
completed
by
mrs.
cleveland
here
was
compiled
after
a
telephone
interview,
and
she
signs
it.
and
sure
enough,
she
would
have
the
liberty,
i
suppose,
in
the
normative
world
to
give
further
explanation
as
to
what
she
may
have
said.
mr.
john
e.
wall,
jr.
no,
justice
ginsburg.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
application
for
social
security
disability
benefits
i
believe
was
filed
on
or
around
january
the
21st
of
1994,
which
was
some
14
days
after
the
onset
of
the
stroke.
mr.
john
e.
wall,
jr.
at
that
point
in
time
no
one
could
tell.
mr.
john
e.
wall,
jr.
yes,
justice
ginsburg,
she
did.
she
wrote
to
them
in
april
of
1994
and
advised
them
that
she
had
returned
to
work.
mr.
john
e.
wall,
jr.
precisely.
mr.
john
e.
wall,
jr.
well,
the
reason
being,
mr.
chief
justice,
is
that
this
unfairly,
i
would
submit,
submits
the
burden
upon
the
petitioner
or
the
plaintiff
in
an
ada
case
to
disprove
an
affirmative
defense
raised
by
a
defendant.
mr.
john
e.
wall,
jr.
because
it's
not
mrs.
cleveland's
burden
to
prove
or
disprove
an
affirmative
defense.
they
bear
the
burden
of
the
preponderance
of
the
evidence.
mr.
john
e.
wall,
jr.
i
agree.
mr.
john
e.
wall,
jr.
i
agree,
your
honor.
the
reason
we
would
submit
to
the
court
that
this
theory
of
judicial
estoppel
should
be
discarded
in
the
ada
social
security
administration
context
is
because
of
all
of
the
reasons
we
have
enunciated
for
the
court
here.
mr.
john
e.
wall,
jr.
i'm
sorry,
i
missed.
mr.
john
e.
wall,
jr.
well,
number
one,
the
social
security
administration
never
takes
into
consideration
a
reasonable
workplace
accommodation
at
any
stage
of
the
game.
all
of
the
information
that's
gathered,
i
would
submit,
from
the
social
security
administration
passes
through
the
filter
of
the
social
security
regulations
and,
as
we
know
from
the
amicus
brief
by
the
united
states
of
america
in
this
case,
those
issues
are
never
inquired
about.
mr.
john
e.
wall,
jr.
well,
we
know
in
light
of--
mr.
john
e.
wall,
jr.
--two
ways,
justice
o'connor.
number
one,
the
fifth
circuit
since
the
cleveland
decision
was
enunciated
has
not
ruled
in
favor
of
an
ada
claimant,
period,
on
this
issue.
so
clearly
it
is
very
limited
and
highly
unusual
as
far
as
their
review.
mr.
john
e.
wall,
jr.
yes,
your
honor,
and
i
think
that's
precisely
what
happens
in
a
normal
summary
judgment
setting.
what
would
happen,
i
would
envision,
is
the
defense
would
say:
you
cannot
establish
that
you're
otherwise
qualified
to
perform
this
job
with
or
without
accommodation,
by
reason
of
what
you
said
to
the
social
security
administration.
mr.
john
e.
wall,
jr.
precisely.
mr.
john
e.
wall,
jr.
perhaps,
depending
upon
the
filing
dates,
justice
souter,
depending
upon
what's
represented.
mr.
john
e.
wall,
jr.
yes,
sir.
also
there
is
this
issue
that
ever
remains,
and
that's
the
issue
of
whether
or
not
workplace
accommodation
is
taken
into
consideration.
in
light
of
the
guidelines--
mr.
john
e.
wall,
jr.
--i
would
humbly
disagree.
mr.
john
e.
wall,
jr.
unfortunately,
no,
and
the
reason
being
is
the
question
has
never
been
as
far
as
i
can
understand
analyzed
on
an
empirical
basis
as
to
how
many
people
have
been
on
social
security
disability,
have
tried
to
remove
themselves
from
the
roll
as
a
ward,
and
have
been
unsuccessful
in
their
effort
to
return
to
gainful
employment
with
accommodation.
mr.
john
e.
wall,
jr.
have
enrolled?
that
i'm
aware
of,
no,
your
honor.
i'm
sure
there
is
the
data
available.
unfortunately,
i'm
not
able
to
provide
it.
mr.
john
e.
wall,
jr.
precisely,
to
effectuate
this
rehabilitation
program,
the
nine
month
period,
the
intermittent
periods
of
unsuccessful
work
attempt,
the
efforts
to
go
to
some
sort
of
rehabilitation
program.
if
i
may,
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time
for
rebuttal
if
necessary.
mr.
john
e.
wall,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
please
the
court:
the
very
troubling
notion
that's
posed
here
by
the
respondent
in
this
case
is
that
somehow
the
matrix
of
the
summary
judgment
system
should
be
reinvented.
as
a
practical
matter,
the
presumption
arises
once
the
motion
is
filed.
what
we
have
is
a
complaint
filed
by
the
disabled,
the
motion
is
filed,
the
evidence
comes
forward
in
the
form
of
the
claim
file,
and
then
the
explanation
must
be
made.
mr.
john
e.
wall,
jr.
well--
mr.
john
e.
wall,
jr.
--i
think
not.
mr.
john
e.
wall,
jr.
loses.
mr.
john
e.
wall,
jr.
she
wins.
mr.
john
e.
wall,
jr.
the
frightening
proposition
here
is
is
that
somehow
these
people
for
whom
mrs.
cleveland
is
the
voice,
the
voice
of
one,
the
disabled,
who
cry
from
the
wilderness,
the
wilderness
of
the
world
if
the
disabled,
is
that
they
are
presumed
to
have
lied.
i
have
a
fundamental
problem
with
that
concept,
particularly
in
light
of
the
fact
that
the
social
security
administration
doesn't
ask
these
questions
that
arise
in
the
ada,
never
inquires
about
accommodation.
in
the
normative,
in
the
ideal
world,
what
would
happen
here
is
in
mrs.
cleveland's
case
there
would
have
been
a
referral
from
the
investigator
at
the
texas
rehabilitation
commission
to
the
eeoc
and
they
would
have
sent
the
enforcement
division
there.
but
that
doesn't
happen,
unfortunately.
mr.
john
e.
wall,
jr.
it
still
never
inquires,
your
honor,
about
the
question
of
accommodation.
