well,
if
you
say
it's
just
a
search
for
the
truth,
you
lose,
because
then
it
just
goes
in
like
all
the
other
evidence.
we
have
all
this
evidence
that
shows
that
she
can't
be
accommodated,
and
among
them
is
this
statement
that
she
herself
made
previously.
that's
just
normal
litigation.
what
we're
talking
about
here...
actually,
i
think
we
put
it
wrong.
it's
not
shifting
the
burden
in
the
sense
of
shifting
it
from
one
party
to
the
other
party.
it's
shifting
the
burden
in
the
sense
of
changing,
changing
the
nature
of
the
burden.
as
i
understand
your
position,
what
happens
is
when
there
has
been
this
inconsistent
statement
the
nature
of
the
trial
changes.
she
has
to
explain
why
that
statement
was
true
at
the
time,
and
if
she
cannot
explain
why
it
was
true
at
the
time
she
loses,
even
if,
even
if
she
carries
her
burden
of
showing
that
currently
she
is
entitled
to
an
accommodation.
isn't
that
what
you're
saying?
