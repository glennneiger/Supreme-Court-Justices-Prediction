justice
stephen
g.
breyer
in
1994,
carolyn
cleveland
suffered
stroke.
she
applied
for
and
then
she
later
received
social
security
disability
benefits.
those
are
available
to
disabled
people
who
can't
work.
now,
at
the
same
time,
her
employer
discharged
her
on
the
ground
that
she
could
not
any
longer
adequately
perform
her
job.
she
later
on
brought
this
lawsuit
against
her
employers.
it's
a
suit
under
the
americans
with
disabilities
act.
she
claims
in
the
suit
that
she
could
perform
her
job
with
reasonable
accommodation.
now,
we
granted
certiorari
in
order
to
consider
how
to
resolve
a
conflict
that
might
arise
when
a
person
tries
to
assert
claims
both
for
social
security
disability
and
under
the
ada.
the
kind
of
conflict
i'm
talking
about
is
not
purely
factual.
as
for
an
example
when
somebody
just
says,
“well,
the
light
was
red
and
now
it
was
green.”
rather
the
conflict
is
connected
with
the
statutes,
the
two
statutes,
basic
legal
requirements,
an
applicant
can
qualify
for
ssdi
social
security
disability
only
if
she,
“cannot
engage
in
either
her
previous
work
or
any
other
kind
of
work
which
exists
in
the
national
economy.”
now,
plaintiff
can
recover
under
the
ada
only
if
she
can
perform
the
essential
functions
of
her
job,
at
least,
with
reasonable
accommodation.
now,
some
courts
have
thought
as
a
result
of
the
requirements
i
just
read
that
trying
to
obtain
or
obtaining
relief
under
both
statutes
would
rather
be
like
saying,
“no,
i
can't
work
for
the
ssdi
statute”,
“no,
i
can
work
for
the
ada.”
and
for
that
reason,
those
courts
have
used
the
doctrine
of
judicial
estoppel
or
sometimes
they've
created
presumptions,
which
make
recovery
under
the
ada
difficult
or
impossible
for
a
person
who
applied
for
or
received
ssdi.
now,
the
fifth
circuit
in
this
case,
for
example,
created
a
rebuttable
presumption
that
would
allow
a
person
who
has
applied
for
or
received
ssdi
to
recover
under
the
ada
only
under
what
it
said,
were
some
limited
and
highly
unusual
set
of
circumstances.
in
the
opinion
that
we've
written,
we
--
we
disagree
with
the
fifth
circuit
and
we
hold
that
courts
should
not
judicially
estop
an
ada
plaintiff
or
apply
a
special
negative
presumption
in
a
case
like
this
one.
that's
because
there
are
just
too
many
instances
in
which
the
kind
of
conflict
that
i
just
mentioned
is
only
on
the
surface,
but
when
you
go
into
it
more
deeply,
you
discover
it
isn't
real.
given
the
administrative
needs
of
the
vast
governmental
ssdi
benefits
program,
for
example,
the
government
cannot
easily
and
does
not
look
into
what's
called
reasonable
accommodation
when
it
decides
that
an
applicant
can't
work
for
purposes
of
ssdi.
but
a
plaintiff
could
win
an
ada
suit
by
showing
that
she
can
work
only
with
reasonable
accommodation.
moreover,
the
government
awards
ssdi
through
applying
a
matrix.
it's
like
an
administrative
matrix
that's
keyed
to
systems
which
in
fact
means
an
applicant
could
qualify
for
ssdi
because
the
applicant
would
fall
into
a
certain
category,
even
if
that
applicant
in
fact
was
capable
of
doing
some
kinds
of
work.
and
then
in
certain
circumstances,
the
ssa
explicitly
awards
benefits
to
those
who
actually
are
working
in
something
called
a
trial-work
program,
and
medical
conditions,
anyway,
can
change
over
time.
now,
for
these
and
related
reasons,
an
ssdi
claim
and
an
ada
claim
may
often
exist
comfortably
side
by
side.
still,
we
do
think
that
an
ada
plaintiff
cannot
simply
ignore
the
fact
that
she
previously
applied
for
or
received
ssdi.
she
must
explain
how
the
two
claims
are
compatible
and
in
the
context
of
summary
judgment
that
explanation
must
warrant
a
reasonable
juror's
conclusion
that
assuming
the
truth
of
or
the
plaintiff's
good
faith
belief
in
the
ssdi
claim,
she
could,
nonetheless,
perform
the
essential
functions
of
her
job
with
or
without
reasonable
accommodation.
carolyn
cleveland
believes
she
can
easily
provide
such
an
explanation
in
the
trial
court.
we
therefore
vacate
the
circuit
court's
judgment
and
remand
the
case
so
that
she
may
have
an
opportunity
to
do
so.
the
opinion
of
the
court
is
unanimous.
