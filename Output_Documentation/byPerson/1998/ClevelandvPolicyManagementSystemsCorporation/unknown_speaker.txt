unknown
speaker
what
is
the
bearing
of
the
mckenna
action
on
the
question
presented
here?
unknown
speaker
it
involves
what?
unknown
speaker
it
seems
to
me
the
difference
is...
i
have
the
same
concern
as
the
chief
justice
apparently
has...
here
you
have
an
application,
an
official
form.
it
would
be
like
a
judgment
in
some
other
hypotheticals
we
might
suppose.
that
wasn't
involved
in
the
case
that
you
cite.
unknown
speaker
well,
mr.
wall,
do
you
think
that
statements
made
by
your
client
in
making
an
application
for
social
security
disability
should
be
admissible
as
evidence
in
the
event
of
a
subsequent
ada
request?
unknown
speaker
and
if
somebody
such
as
your
client
has
said,
i
am
totally
disabled,
that
might
be
pretty
strong
evidence,
i
suppose,
even
if
you
don't
give
it
presumptive
effect?
that's
what
she
said:
i
am
totally
disabled.
i
suppose
that
that
is
some
evidence.
presumably,
that
could
change
over
time.
but
speaking
as
of
the
time
she
made
the
statement,
that
would
be
an
important
piece
of
evidence,
i
suppose?
unknown
speaker
well,
why
shouldn't
it
be
even
more
than
just
strong
evidence?
if
she
has
sworn
to
a
government
agency
that
she
is
100
percent
disabled,
why
doesn't
that
shift
the
burden
to
her
to
show
that,
even
though
there
are
differences
between
what
ada,
why
doesn't
it
shift
the
burden
to
her
to
show
that
those
differences
are
relevant
in
this
case,
that
is
to
say
that
her
statement
did
not
take
into
account
accommodation
or
her
statement
was
made
at
a
later
date
or
whatever?
why
doesn't
it
shift
the
burden
to
you
it
seems
to
me?
unknown
speaker
well,
but
the
doctrine
of
judicial
estoppel
does
upset
the
normal
process.
i
mean,
when
you
have
on
the
record
testimony
under
oath
in
another,
in
another
government
proceeding,
we
upset
the
normal
process.
and
here
she's
there
under
oath
saying
that
she's
100
percent
disabled.
why
isn't
it
reasonable
to
put
the
burden
on
her
to
explain
to
the
tryer
of
fact
why
that
doesn't
mean
that
she's
100
percent
disabled
for
purposes
of
the
ada?
unknown
speaker
but
the
question
is
is
it
just
an
admission
against
interest
that
can
come
in
along
with
all
the
other
evidence
in
the
case
or
is
it
something
more,
something
that
should
actually
shift
the
burden
of
proof?
unknown
speaker
why
not?
unknown
speaker
well,
they
have
enough
normal
language
perception
to
fill
out
the
application,
i
take
it?
unknown
speaker
with
respect
to
that,
mr.
wall,
the
facts
are
a
little
confusing.
i
thought
that
when
she
initially
had
her
stroke
nobody
knew
whether
she
would
recover,
because
she
wasn't...
at
the
time
she
had
her
stroke,
she
had
no
memory,
she
could
hardly
talk.
at
what
point
did
she
file
that
application?
this
is
the
kind
of
disability
one
may
recover
from
and
one
may
not.
so
had
she...
had
she
made
a
startling
recovery
by
the
time
she
filed
that
application?
unknown
speaker
what
was
the
medical
opinion
at
that
time?
could
anyone
say
whether
she
was
going
to
get
back
to
any
kind
of
non
disabled
state?
unknown
speaker
and
when
she...
when
her
doctor
told
her
that
she
could
work,
did
she
notify
social
security?
unknown
speaker
so
i
think
that
would
be
relevant,
too.
she
was
not
claiming
benefits,
entitlement
to
benefits,
when
she
went
back
to
work.
unknown
speaker
well,
why
couldn't
all
of
that
evidence
come
in
and
nonetheless
have
the
burden
of
proof
shifted
by
virtue
of
the
application?
i
mean,
all
of
that
obviously
could
come
in
by
way
of
explanation
of
why
she
shouldn't
be
bound
by
this
thing.
unknown
speaker
well,
but
as
justice
scalia
says,
if
we
were
to
apply
any
sort
of
judicial
estoppel
that
would
be
the
effect.
and
why
not
at
least
a
halfway
house
here,
where
you
say
the
burden
of
proof
is
simply
reversed?
unknown
speaker
but
that
doesn't
deal
at
all
with
the
whole
idea
of
judicial
estoppel.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
think
you
have
to
deal
with
it.
unknown
speaker
that
lots
of
people
have
disabilities
and
so
forth
who
file,
who
sign
the
applications?
unknown
speaker
well,
you
say
for
all
the
reasons
that
you
have
assigned.
what
are
those
reasons?
unknown
speaker
well,
fine
and
she
can
bring
in
that
evidence
as
part
of
the
rebuttal.
i
mean,
the
proposal
is
simply
the
only
burden
that's
placed
on
her
is
to
show
that
the
reason
that
this
prior
sworn
statement
does
not
put
her
out
of
court
here
is
because
the
accommodation
issue
was
the
difference,
that
at
that
time
had
she
taken
into
account
accommodation
she
wouldn't
have
made
that
sworn
statement.
that's
the
only
burden
put
on
her.
but
if
in
fact
accommodation
is
irrelevant
to
the
matter,
then
i
don't
know
why
she
should
be
able
to
swear
one
way
one
time
and
another
way
another
time.
may
i
ask,
may
i
ask
you
what
you
think
that
the...
is
it
the
fifth
circuit
here...
court
of
appeals
held?
they
spoke
in
terms
of
saying
a
rebuttable
presumption
was
created
that
would
judicially
estop
your
client
from
asserting
she
was
a
qualified
individual
and
that
she
could
overcome
it,
if
at
all,
only
under
some
limited
and
highly
unusual
set
of
circumstances.
do
you
think
that
the
fifth
circuit
applied
more
than
just
a
simple
burden
shift,
but
rather
a
very
strong
sort
of
a
presumption?
unknown
speaker
it
isn't
clear
to
me.
how
do
you
interpret
that
opinion?
unknown
speaker
well,
what
if
it
were
just
a
normal
burden
shift?
somebody
has
filed
with
an
application
for
a
permanent
disability,
an
application
that
says
i'm
totally
disabled.
now,
what
if
it
were
just
an
ordinary
rebuttable
presumption,
so
that
the
burden
shifts
then
to
the
claimant
to
say,
yes,
i
said
that
then,
but
in
the
meantime
i've
recovered
almost
totally,
and
besides
i
could
be,
with
reasonable
accommodation,
i
could
be
employed?
now,
would
that
be
okay?
unknown
speaker
but
it
would
alter,
it
would
alter
the
summary
judgment
matrix,
i
take
it,
in
one
sense,
that
you
would
lose,
if
you
don't
carry
at
least
showing
a
factual
dispute
about
a
point,
rather
than
the
other
side
losing.
unknown
speaker
well,
if
you...
let's
assume
there
is
no,
there
is
no
presumption,
rebuttable
presumption
of
estoppel.
the
other
side
files
a
motion
for
summary
judgment.
on
the
basis
of
the
motion...
in
support
of
the
motion
for
summary
judgment,
it
presents
through
affidavits
the
records
of
what
your
client
had
sworn
to
in
getting
the
social
security
benefits,
and
on
the
face
that
evidence
shows
that
your
client
says,
i
am
disabled.
do
you
agree
that
if
you
do
nothing,
if
you
present
no
counter
affidavit,
no
counter
evidence,
you're
going
to
lose
the
motion
for
summary
judgment,
right?
you
don't
need
a
presumption
to
lose
it;
you're
going
to
lose
it?
unknown
speaker
so
it's
a
difference,
it's
the
timing
is
perhaps
the
one
respect
in
which
it
will
make
a
difference
whether
we
have
an
enduring
presumption
or
whether
we
simply
follow
the
normal
rules
of
summary
judgment,
which
would
require
a
response
in
order
to
establish
that
there's
a
genuine
issue.
is
that
basically
what
it
boils
down
to?
unknown
speaker
well,
we
all
realize
that
it's
not.
but
i
think
it's
also...
you
may
dispute
this,
but
i
was
assuming
that
it
was
fair
to
say
that,
even
though
the
legal
standards
of
the
two
acts
are
different,
in
most
cases
in
which
an
individual
says
for
social
security
purposes,
i'm
disabled,
that
person
probably
is
not
going
to
be
in
a
position
to
work
at
the
old
job
for
ada
purposes
even
with
some
accommodation.
i'm
sure
there
are
cases
in
which
that
is
not
true,
but
i
would
suppose
that
as
a
general
rule
if
you're
disabled
for
one
you're
probably
not
going
to
be
able
to
work
with
accommodation
for
the
other,
and
therefore
a
probability
inference
would
be
justifiable
for
summary
judgment
purposes,
i.e.,
you
would
raise
an
issue
of
fact
and
if
that
fact
was
not
rebutted
you'd
lose.
am
i
wrong
about
the
unlikelihood
that
you
would
be
disabled
for
social
security
and
still
be
able
to
work
with
some
accommodation?
unknown
speaker
what
do
we
have...
do
we
have
any
empirical
evidence
on
it?
i
mean,
we
all
recognize
that
legally
it's
possible,
no
question
about
it.
do
we
know
in
the
real
world
how
this
tends
to
work
out?
unknown
speaker
is
there
any...
is
there
any
study
of
the
social
security
program
that
allows
people
to
keep
their
disability
benefits
and
yet
work
for
this
nine
month
trial
period?
how
many
people
are
enrolled
in
that
program?
unknown
speaker
but
at
least
the
two
are
not
inconsistent,
because
the
law
itself
allows
people
who
are
getting
benefits
to
be
working
and
keeping
those
benefits
for
the,
is
it,
nine
month
period?
unknown
speaker
could
you
tell
us,
mr.
roberts,
is
it
true
that
the
social
security
administration
in
administering
disability
provisions
of
the
act
did
not
take
into
consideration
reasonable
accommodations
under
the
ada?
unknown
speaker
you
could...
you
could
not
take
it
into
account
in
the
initial
granting
of
benefits,
but
allow
it
to
be
refuted
later
on,
it
seems
to
me.
i
just
find
it
extraordinary
that
we
have
a
law
here
which
requires
employers
to
make
accommodations
to
disabled
persons
and
yet
your
agency
is
giving
away
money
under
the,
under
the
social
security
disability
provisions
presumably
to
people
who
are
entitled
to
those
accommodations
and
who
therefore
are
employable,
but
you're
just
closing
your
eyes
to
the
fact
that
the
employer
must
make
accommodations.
it
just
doesn't
make
any
sense
at
all.
the
law
doesn't
require
that,
does
it?
it's
just
your
regulations?
unknown
speaker
well,
of
course,
the
social
security
act,
there
are
substantial
hearings
on
whether
or
not
the
applicant
can
pursue
any
kind
of
gainful
employment,
and
the
administration
just
closes
its
eyes
to
the
employer's
duty
to
accommodate?
i
just
don't
understand
that.
unknown
speaker
well,
if
they
were
not
accommodated
but
then
the
employee
in
fact
persuaded
the
employer,
because
of
ada,
to
let
him
go
back
to
work
with
accommodation,
at
that
point
the
permanent
disability
would
be
cut
off
presumably?
unknown
speaker
is
there
some
nine
month
interval,
though--
unknown
speaker
--to
see
how
it
works
out--
unknown
speaker
--during
which--
unknown
speaker
--it
would
continue?
unknown
speaker
so
for
nine
months
the
person
both
gets
the
pay
of
the
job
and
total
disability
benefits?
unknown
speaker
but
what's
the
justification
for
that?
unknown
speaker
well,
so
there's
a
real
incentive
for
someone
certainly
to
apply
for
social
security
disability,
but
also
to
pursue
whatever
rights
there
are
under
ada.
i
mean,
there
would
be
that
incentive,
presumably.
unknown
speaker
let
me
ask
you
whether
you
think
that
it
is
workable
in
the
government's
view
to
have
just
a
presumption
that
shifts
the
burden
of
proof
based
on
an
allegation
in
the
social
security
application
of
total
disability.
unknown
speaker
isn't
it
workable
and
wouldn't
it
be
the
normal
thing
you
would
expect
in
other
contexts?
i'm
not
sure
what
the
fifth
circuit
did
here.
it
may
have
applied
more
than
just
a
rebuttable
presumption.
it
looked
like
a
pretty
tough
test.
but
what
if
it
just
shifted
the
burden
so
then
the
claimant
has
to
go
forward
and
say:
yes,
i
said
that,
but
look,
look
at
the
timing,
look
at
the
reasonable
accommodation.
unknown
speaker
i
don't
understand.
the
policy
of
the
act
that
in
close
cases
the
claimant
wins?
is
that
a
policy
of
the
act?
unknown
speaker
they're
not
presumed
unable.
it's
just
this
evidence
comes
in
against
them
and
puts
on
them
the
burden
of
simply
explaining
why
that
wasn't
the
case.
it
shouldn't
be
hard.
in
the
present
case
it
doesn't
seem
hard
at
all.
you
show
evidence
that
there
were
later
developments
or
whatever.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
mean,
there
certainly
is.
you
have
to
say
that,
well,
the
one
reason
why
there
may
not
be,
the
one
reason
why
there
may
not,
is
that
it
may
not
have
taken
into
account
accommodation.
you
know,
that
may
be
the
case
in
how
many
percentages
of
the
cases,
do
you
think?
unknown
speaker
what
about
any
difference
in
the
time
that
it
takes
to
get
the
benefits
going?
compare
a
request
for
social
security
disability
and
a
claim
under
ada.
is
there
any
difference
in
the
speed
with
which
these
determinations
are
made?
unknown
speaker
the
ada
would
depend
on
what
district
you
sued
in,
wouldn't
it?
unknown
speaker
you
don't
disagree
with
mr.
wall,
do
you?
i
mean,
i
thought
you
were
saying...
i'm
not
sure...
i
don't
know
this
presumption,
but
look.
the
person,
the
handicapped
person,
always
has
the
burden
of
proof
of
proving
his
ada
suit.
unknown
speaker
they
always
have
that.
now
there's
a
motion
for
summary
judgment
and
it's
pointed
out
that
the
handicapped
person
asserted
that
he
was
substantially
disabled
to
the
point
where
he
could
not
do
his
past
work
or
any
other
substantial
gainful
work
in
the
economy.
and
he
did
say
that.
so
therefore,
since
he
did
say
that,
at
that
point
he's
going
to
lose
unless
he
explains
it.
and
if
he
explains
it
to
the
point
where
there's
a
genuine
and
material
issue
of
fact
in
his
favor
at
least,
you
go
to
trial.
do
you
disagree
with
that?
unknown
speaker
yes,
that's
the
ordinary
summary
judgment
principle,
that's
it.
unknown
speaker
but
he
has
to
explain
it,
he
has
to
explain
it.
and
he
might
explain
it
because
of
subpart
p,
he
might
explain
it
because
of
justice
kennedy,
he
might
explain
it
because
of
everybody,
nobody
was
accommodated.
unknown
speaker
suppose
he
lied,
suppose
he
lied
in
the
affidavit?
why
does
he
have
to
explain
it?
i
mean,
all
he
has
to
say
is
what
you've
said
here:
my
statement
to
ssi
is
totally
irrelevant
because
what
is
meant
by
unemployability
there
is
not
what
is
meant
by
employability
here,
thank
you
very
much.
and
he
sits
back
and
folds
his
arms,
and
that's
the
end
of
that
whole
sworn
statement.
unknown
speaker
to
show
his
current,
to
show
his
current
disability.
but
that
past
sworn
statement
is
totally
washed
out.
unknown
speaker
it's
right
off,
it's
right
off
the
slate.
unknown
speaker
why
not?
unknown
speaker
well,
that's
simply
an
admission
against
interest,
then.
unknown
speaker
but
no
more,
under
your
view?
unknown
speaker
well,
except
that
i...
may
i
interrupt
you
there,
because
if
that
were
the
issue
here
i
think
we'd
have
a
somewhat
different
case.
as
i
understand
it,
the
presumption
that
the
circuit
applied
was
a
presumption
that
depended
on
either
application
for
benefits
or
an
award
of
benefits
under
the
social
security
act.
it
was
not
a
presumption
that
rested
upon
the
terms
of
the
statements
made
by
the
applicant.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
looked
at
the
fifth
circuit
opinion
and
i
thought
the
fifth
circuit
opinion
referred
specifically
to
application
or
award
of
benefits,
not
to
statements
made
in
aid
of
the
application.
am
i
wrong?
unknown
speaker
okay.
unknown
speaker
okay,
and
that
gets
to
the
suggestion
that
i
was
going
to
make
and
ask
you
to
comment
upon,
which
goes
to
the
question
of
what
difference
does
it
make
to
have
the
presumption
as
opposed
to
following
the
normal
rules.
let's
assume
that
the
person
has
applied
for
the
social
security
benefits
and
later
makes
an
ada
claim.
there's
a
motion
for
summary
judgment
made
by
the
defending
party
in
the
ada
claim
and
what
that
summary
judgment
says,
the
motion
says,
is
this:
the
applicant,
the
plaintiff,
said
in
support
of
his
application
for
social
security
benefits
that
he
was
totally
disabled,
or
whatever
it
was,
if
the...
and
therefore
i'm
entitled
to
summary
judgment
because
the
person
cannot
work
with
accommodation.
that's
the
normal
meaning
of
the
terms
that
the
applicant
used.
if
the
applicant
makes
no
response
to
that,
i
presume
the
applicant
is
going
to
lose
the
summary
judgment
motion
as
a
general
rule.
if
the
applicant
does
make
a
response,
the
applicant
is
going
to
come
in
and
say:
those
are
the
words
that
i
used,
but
i
was
using
them
as
terms
of
art,
or
there
has
been
a
time
difference
which
makes
what
i
said
then
not
necessarily
true
now,
whatever.
under
the
normal
rules
of
summary
judgment,
the
applicant
in
fact
is
going
to
have
to
come
up
with
some
kind
of
an
explanation
for
the
statements
that
the
applicant
made.
why
isn't
that
enough
to
protect
the
interests
that
you're
obviously
concerned
with
here?
unknown
speaker
but
mr.
morrison,
mr.
morrison,
why
do
you
accept
the
premise
that
in
order
to
survive
the
motion
for
summary
judgment
he
must
explain
the
prior
statement?
he
could
certainly
come
in
and
say:
your
honor,
i
don't
know
what
i
said
then.
it
may
well
have
been
wrong.
it
may
well
have
been
a
lie.
but
here
is
the
evidence
that
i
currently
am
able
to
do
the
job
with
accommodation,
whatever
i
said
then.
wouldn't
that
be
enough
to
overcome
a
motion
for
summary
judgment?
unknown
speaker
excuse
me.
isn't
that
also
exactly
what
the
applicant
is
going
to
say
in
order
to
rebut
the
presumption
that
we're
working
with
here?
isn't
the
court
in
fact
going
to
end
up
with
exactly
the
same
material
in
front
of
it,
and
isn't
the
so
called
burden
shifting
rather
a
fiction?
unknown
speaker
isn't
the
difference
that
the
evidence
which
this
presumption
requires
is
not
evidence
that
he
is
now
able
to
work
with
accommodation,
but
evidence
to
show
that
his
prior
statement
was
not
perjurious?
unknown
speaker
and
if
it
was
perjurious
then
he's
out
of
court.
unknown
speaker
and
do
you
think
that
if
the
rule
is
otherwise
he
is
going
to
ignore
the
risk
of
having
his
earlier
statements
regarded
as
being
genuinely
inconsistent
and
hence
raising
a
presumption
of
perjury?
i
would
assume
no,
he's
going
to
explain
it.
so
in
any
case
the
issue
that
ends
up
in
the
lap
of
the
court
is
going
to
be
exactly
the
same,
it
seems
to
me.
unknown
speaker
but
mr.
morrison,
you're
talking
about
credit
and
power.
i
think
the
inquiries
from
the
bench
are
how
does
this
affect
the
summary
judgment
matrix.
i
mean,
it
really
doesn't
do
a
lot
of
good
to
say
a
statement
has
to
be
given
credit
or
power
without
placing
it
in
some...
the
litigation
context.
unknown
speaker
mr.
morrison,
i
would
like
to
stop
you
at
that
point--
--i
think
he's
still
answering
the
question.
oh,
i'm
sorry.
unknown
speaker
thank
you.
unknown
speaker
this
notion
of
judicial
estoppel,
you
talked
about
court.
there's
an
irony
here
because
there's
a
representation
made
to
an
agency
about
a
condition
that
can
change.
somebody
can
really
be
disabled.
the
doctor
can
say:
i
don't
know
if
you'll
ever
get
your
speech
back.
we
just
don't
know.
it's
a
condition
of
uncertainty.
she's
not
barred
from
filing
her
disability
until
we
know
five
years
from
now.
the
representation
is
made
to
an
agency
that
congress
has
said
should
be
interested
in
getting
the
person
off
the
disability
roll
and
into
the
workplace.
so
the
statute
itself
says
there's
nothing
inconsistent
between
getting
benefits
and
going
back
to
work.
in
fact,
that
seems
to
be
congress'
objective.
and
yet
your
position
seems
to
be
this
person
can't
seek
employment,
because
if
she
does
she's
going
to
be
in
this
bind
of
having...
being
judicially
estopped.
the
judicial
estoppel
works
against
the
agency,
works
against
the
social
security
administration,
because
they
don't
want
to
carry
this
person
on
the
disability
roll
if
the
person
is
able
to
work.
so
you
are
getting
the
benefit,
it
seems
to
me,
of
an
estoppel
that
if
it
should
benefit
anybody,
it
should
be
the
social
security
administration,
the
taxpayers.
and
the
taxpayers
are
benefited
by
your
not
having...
being
able
to
use
the
estoppel.
that's
a
very
curious
thing
about
this
case.
unknown
speaker
but
are
there
precedents
in
judicial
estoppel
where
you
never
got
anywhere
near
a
court?
here
there
was
never
any
court
proceeding.
how
far
did
the
thing
go
in
the
social
security
administration?
unknown
speaker
but
didn't
she
tell
them
when
she
went
back
to
work?
when
she
went
back
to
her
old
employment,
didn't
she
tell
them?
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask,
because
i'd
still
like
to
get
this
clear
in
my
mind.
i'm
not
aware
of
any
kind
of
situation
where
one
party
relies
on
an
estoppel
based
on
a
statement
that
was
made
to
some
other
person
in
whose
interest
it
is
not
to
have
that
estoppel.
unknown
speaker
mr.
morrison,
do
you
assume
that
it's
in
the
interest
of
the
social
security
system
not
to
have
the
estoppel?
don't
you
think
there
has
to
be
added
to
justice
ginsburg's
formula,
which
says
of
course
it's
in
the
interest
of
ssi
to
have
the
people
who
are
on
the
rolls
get
off
the
rolls
by
getting
a
job,
but
it's
also
in
the
interest
of
ssi
not
to
have
people
who
don't
belong
on
the
rolls
apply
for
benefits
and
get
them?
unknown
speaker
and
someone
who
knows
that
statements
that
are
false
at
that
stage
are
going
to
cause
trouble
later
on
will
not
make
those
statements
at
that
stage.
unknown
speaker
but
is
your
point
any
different
than...
i
hate
to
say
this,
but
i
don't
understand
what
the
disagreement
is
about.
i
thought
i
heard
the
sg
and
everybody
saying,
yeah,
we
agree
to
that;
one
thing
an
applicant
cannot
do
is
go
in
and
say,
wait,
i
am
disabled,
social
security
administration,
and
then
later
in
the
next
suit
they
can't
come
in
and
say,
oh,
no,
no,
no,
what
i
said
before
was
false.
everybody
says
they
can't
say
that.
what
they
could
say
is,
yes,
yes,
i
did
say
i
was
disabled,
i
was
disabled
for
purposes
of
the
social
security
act,
that
means
i
couldn't
hold
any
job
in
the
economy,
and
i'd
like
to
tell
you
something;
i
just
did
it
under
subpart
p,
where
they
don't
really
look
to
see
whether
there's
some
other
job
somewhere,
that's
why.
or
you
might
say,
you
know
what,
i
got
better.
or
they
might
say,
you
know
what,
nobody
in
this
line
of
business
is
properly
accommodating.
but
they
have
to
say
something
like
that,
and
they
can't
just
say,
i
didn't
tell
the
truth
before
or
sweep
it
under
the
rug.
now,
if
they
agree
to
that
and
you
agree
to
that,
why
don't
we
end
this
case?
what's
this
about?
have
they
agreed
to
that,
mr.
morrison?
again,
i
question
the
premise.
i
thought...
i
thought
that
what
they
would
say
is,
i'm
entitled
to
come
in
with
evidence
to
show
that
i
currently
am
entitled
to
accommodation
and
i
can
do
the
work
with
accommodation.
now,
you're
entitled
to
bring
in
that
statement
in
the
past
and
that'll
go
to
the
factfinder
for
whatever
it's
worth.
but
the
factfinder
can
find
that
that
statement
in
the
past
was
false--
--no.
--but
that's
irrelevant
to
the
decision.
no,
no,
i
don't
think
they
could.
i
think
what
you'd
have
to
do
is...
it's
summary
judgment,
is
that
right?
it's
summary
judgment.
i
mean,
how
does
it
work?
therefore
the
defendant
has
said,
look,
there's
this
statement
she's
disabled.
at
that
point
your
opponent
has
to
come
in
with
a
piece
of
information
that
shows
there's
a
genuine
and
material
fact
that
would
entitle
her
to
win.
and
to
do
that
she
has
to
explain
that
there's
a
difference
now
of
the
sort
we're
talking
about,
that
justice
kennedy
mentioned
or
that
i
mentioned.
now,
is
that
your
understanding
of
it
or
not?
unknown
speaker
mr.
morrison,
the
problem
i
have
with
your
explanation
is
that
as
i
read
the
fifth
circuit
opinion
they
did
more
than
just
say
she
has
to
come
in
with
an
explanation.
they
said
only
under
some
limited
and
highly
unusual
set
of
circumstances
can
it
be
rebutted.
i
don't
understand
that.
that
seems
to
be
more
than
burden
shifting,
more
than
allowing
her
to
come
in
with
a
reasonable
explanation.
unknown
speaker
but
that
language
as
i
read
it
does
more
than
you
are
saying.
unknown
speaker
don't
defend
that
as
the
standard?
unknown
speaker
i
can
understand
an
ordinary
we'll
shift
the
burden
concept.
but
it
looks
to
me
like
they
did
more
than
that.
unknown
speaker
mr.
morrison,
are
you
finished?
unknown
speaker
okay.
unknown
speaker
there's
been
considerable
discussion
of
rebuttable
presumption
in
your
ada
case,
where
presumably
the
burden
of
proof
is
on
the
plaintiff.
how
much
difference,
if
any,
would
a
rebuttable
presumption
make
in
the
summary
judgment
context?
unknown
speaker
i
suppose
our
problem
here
could
be
put
in
focus
if
we
asked,
what
are
we
trying
to
do
in
the
second
trial?
a,
are
we
trying
to
find
out
the
facts
of
her
capabilities
and
her
disabilities
and
her
illnesses?
or
b,
are
we
trying
to
do
that
plus
penalize
her,
discourage
her,
sanction
her,
for
making
false
statements?
it
seems
to
me
that
implicit
in
what
the
fifth
circuit
has
done
is
a
test...
an
objective
to
do
the
latter,
to
discourage
false
statements,
and
that's
what
judicial
estoppel
is
for,
i
suppose.
unknown
speaker
because
that's
just
standard
admission
against
interest
and
we're
trying
to
find
out.
it's
a
tool
to
find
out
what
the
facts
are?
unknown
speaker
and
why
is
that?
unknown
speaker
so
we
are
attempting
to
vindicate
the
integrity
of
the
administrative
and
the
judicial
system;
is
that
the
point?
unknown
speaker
would
you
agree
with
me
that
the
petitioner
and
the
government
do
not
share
that
concern?
the
petitioner
and
the
government
are
not
interested
in
vindicating
the
integrity
of
the
system,
to
punish
for
past
malfeasance
or
past
wrong.
they
are
simply
interested
in
knowing
the
facts
of
the
disability.
it
seems
to
me
that's
why
the
two
arguments
don't
meet
here.
maybe
i'm
mischaracterizing
their
position.
maybe
the
taxpayer
ought
to
be
vindicated
and
let's
get
her
off
the
disability
rolls
and
back
to
work
if
a
reasonable
accommodation
is
possible.
i
mean,
that's
theoretically
in
the
balance,
too.
unknown
speaker
but
why
isn't
that
more
than
just
in
the
balance,
because
congress
put
into
the
statute
that
you
can
maintain
your
disability
pay
and
work?
so
there
was
no
deception
before
the
alj,
was
there,
as
to...
this
thing
went
on
for
how
many
months,
and
in
the
interlude
she
tried
to
go
back
to
work,
was
unsuccessful.
none
of
that
was
hidden
in
the
agency
proceeding,
was
it?
unknown
speaker
but
the
employer's
position
is
consistent
with
hers
to
this
extent:
the
employer
is
saying,
we
can't
accommodate
this
woman;
she's
disabled.
unknown
speaker
but
she
said
when
she
went
back
to
work,
she
told
social
security,
i'm
not
asking
for
benefits
now
because
i'm
working.
the
employer
said,
you
can't
work,
you're
disabled.
unknown
speaker
but
as
far
as
the
facts
of
what
she
did--
unknown
speaker
--all
of
that
was
before
the
social
security
administration
when
it
made
its
decision?
unknown
speaker
they
knew
that
she
had
gone
back
to
work.
unknown
speaker
first
part
time,
then
full
time.
and
then
they
made
the
decision
that
they
did.
but
i
don't
understand
an
estoppel
when
the
full
record
of
everything
that
happened...
she
withheld
nothing
from
the
social
security
administration.
unknown
speaker
well
then,
what
is...
when
congress
said
you
put
in
an
application
that
says
you're
totally
disabled--
unknown
speaker
--but
we
know
that
some
people
with
accommodation
can
work,
and
also
that
people
surprise
the
medical
profession,
they
get
better.
unknown
speaker
and
then
sometimes
they
get
worse.
unknown
speaker
so
we're
setting
up
this
program
to
encourage
people,
despite
that
statement
that
they've
made,
to
work.
unknown
speaker
so
i
don't
see
that
there's
this
clash,
that
if
i
said
i'm
disabled
that
means
that
i'm
disabled
today
and
will
be
disabled
tomorrow.
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
you
to
comment
on
this.
one
answer
to
the
argument
that
you're
making
is
that
her
statements
were
made
using
what
i
guess
lawyers
would
call
terms
of
art.
she
was
talking
about
disability
for
the
social
security
act
in
terms
of
disability
as
understood
through
step
three
of
the
process
of
certification.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
thought...
at
any
rate,
through
the
steps,
whatever
number.
and
for
purposes
of
ada
she's
simply
using
the
word
in
a
different
fashion.
one
reason
that
has
been
suggested
in
the
briefs,
although
that's
not
what
we're
here
to
resolve,
but
i
mean
one
reason
that's
been
suggested
in
the
briefs
is
that
in
her
social
security
application
she
was
using
form
language.
in
other
words,
she
was
using
the
language
of
social
security's
own
application.
that
may
or
may
not
be
ultimately
a
satisfactory
explanation.
i
have
no
idea.
but
isn't
that
a
further
reason
for
saying
we
ought
to
think
twice
before
we
set
up
presumptions,
because
in
fact
if
people
use
the
terms
of
statutes
the
way
the
statutes
are
written
and
the
terms
are
not
inconsistent
with
each
other,
even
though
they
might
seem
to
be
in
normal
english,
we
don't
want
to
penalize
somebody
by
setting
up
this
presumption?
what
is
your
answer
to
that
argument?
unknown
speaker
but
your
answer
is,
number
one,
she
didn't
just
confine
herself
to
the
forms,
and
i
take
it
your
answer
is
no
one,
in
effect,
can
plead
that
as
an
applicant
he
was
just
using
forms,
because
you
have
to
make
discursive
statements
in
which
you
tell
facts
not
repeating
formal
language.
is
that
basically
it?
unknown
speaker
maybe
courts
should
get
madder
about
this
than
the
social
security
administration
might.
unknown
speaker
how
would
that
affect
the
social
security's
program
of
telling
people,
try
to
go
back
to
work,
we'll
keep
your
benefits?
you
said
you
weren't
disabled.
we
want
you
to
work.
shouldn't
social
security...
that
seems
to
be
a
real
clash.
unknown
speaker
well,
but
now
look.
the
social
security
has
certain
disabilities
that
they
automatically
treat
as
qualifying...
blindness.
unknown
speaker
and
yet
the
ada
clearly
contemplates
that
for
some
blind
people
reasonable
accommodation
can
be
made.
so
there
is
a
conflict,
if
you
will,
in
the
two
approaches,
and
someone
could
apply
for
disability
under
one
of
those
automatic
provisions
and
yet
qualify
under
ada
with
reasonable
accommodation.
so
you
do
have
a
problem.
unknown
speaker
must
it
be
made?
i'd
like
to
clarify
whether
justice
breyer's
assumption
of
your
position
is
correct.
do
you
acknowledge
that,
even
though
in
the
summary
judgment
proceedings
the
plaintiff
establishes
that
she
currently
could
do
the
work
with
an
accommodation,
even
though
she
establishes
that,
nonetheless
if
she
does
not
establish
that
she
was
not
lying
previously
she
loses?
unknown
speaker
suppose
you
come
in
with
all
they
evidence
that
shows
she
can
be
accommodated,
but
what
you
haven't
done
is
explain
the
contrary
statement
she
made
earlier.
do
you
lose?
unknown
speaker
i
didn't
think
you
thought
so.
if
you
take
out
the
word
"currently".
sorry,
then
i
didn't
understand
it.
i
thought
you
said
on
day
one
your
client
has
filed
an
application
for
social
security
saying,
i'm
totally
disabled.
on
day
two
she's
in
court
and
she
says,
i
want
to
tell
you
about
day
one.
on
day
one,
the
same
day,
i
want
to
win
under
the
ada,
and
they
say,
what
about
your
application
to
social
security?
she
says,
i'm
not
telling
you
a
word
about
that,
i
refuse
to
explain
it.
all
right.
now,
does
your
client
win
or
not?
unknown
speaker
fine,
okay.
add
something
else.
in
the
context
of
the
summary
judgment
motion,
although
she
doesn't
explain
the
prior
statement,
she
puts
in
a
ton
of
evidence
that
demonstrates
quite
conclusively
that
her
current
condition
can
be
accommodated.
does
she
win
or
lose?
unknown
speaker
i
missed
that.
i
rest,
i
rest
my
case.
[laughter]
your
time
has
expired.
unknown
speaker
but
i
thought
it's
been
conceded
that
if
all
that
she's
done
is
to
make
the
conclusory
allegation
that
tracks
the
language
of
the
statute
that
she's
disabled,
that
that
would
not
trigger
this,
this
alteration
in
the
summary
judgment
matrix.
it's
only
when
she
makes
very
concrete
statements...
i
have
been
unable
to
do,
i
have
been
unable
to
lift
my
arm,
i
have
been
unable
to
do
work.
that's
not
terms
of
art.
