mr.
stephen
g.
morrison
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
courts
will
continue
to
be
faced
with
the
obvious
tension
between
the
social
security
administration
definition
of
ada.
they
will
continue
to
find
some
cases
where
this
is...
the
social
security
administration
records
should
be
dispositive,
and
the
courts
will
need
a
sensitive
and
sensible
tool
to
deal
with
that.
that
sensitive
and
sensible
tool
should
begin
with
the
fact
that
the
under
oath
statements
to
the
social
security
should
be
given
great
credit.
mr.
stephen
g.
morrison
justice
souter,
i
think
it
relied
on
both
and,
as
the
rebuttable--
mr.
stephen
g.
morrison
--justice
souter,
that
is
the
reference
in
the
case.
mr.
stephen
g.
morrison
however,
the
rebuttable
presumption
would
be
a
sensitive
tool
to
require
the
courts
to
go
down
into
the
record
and
look
at
the
statements,
because
if
the
rebuttal
was
made
the
court
would
then
look
at
the
context
of
the
statements
that
were
made.
mr.
stephen
g.
morrison
because
the
applicant
has
made,
justice
souter,
11
representations
under
oath
to
the
social
security
administration
that
she
is
fully
and
totally
disabled.
mr.
stephen
g.
morrison
exactly,
justice
scalia,
and
yet
it
would
be
unfair--
mr.
stephen
g.
morrison
--justice
souter,
i
don't
agree
that
it
is,
that
it
is
a
fiction,
because
you're
giving
credibility
to
those
statements
made
under
oath
at
one
time.
mr.
stephen
g.
morrison
exactly,
justice
scalia.
mr.
stephen
g.
morrison
exactly,
justice
scalia.
mr.
stephen
g.
morrison
justice
souter,
the
statements
that
are
made
have
to
be
given
weight
or
credit
in
the
course...
he
can't
just
come
in
and
say,
i
didn't
mean
it,
or
i
was
lying
back
then.
they
have
to
be
given
power
to--
mr.
stephen
g.
morrison
--these
matters,
chief
justice
rehnquist,
will
arise
frequently
at
the
summary
judgment
stage,
and
essentially
what
we
would
suggest
is
what
the
fifth
circuit
did.
you
have
a
foundation
of
judicial
estoppel,
which
allows
the
credit
to
be
given
to
the
statement.
that
is,
you
cannot
take
a
contrary
position
before
the
second
court,
if
you
will.
mr.
stephen
g.
morrison
and
when
that
occurs,
when
that
occurs,
then
the
rebuttable
presumption
comes
into
play
and
you
may
try
to
explain.
you
may
explain
that
away.
if
you
are
able
to
explain
that
away,
then
the
summary
judgment
burden
of
going
forward
still
exists
and
you
try
to
go
forward.
mr.
stephen
g.
morrison
so
that's
the
matrix,
your
honor.
mr.
stephen
g.
morrison
justice
ginsburg,
that
is
the
genius
of
the
rebuttable
presumption
that
tempers
what
could
be
considered
the
harshness
of
judicial
estoppel.
in
other
words,
the
party
is
presumed
judicially
estopped,
but
if
she
can--
mr.
stephen
g.
morrison
--it
went
for
18
months,
all
the
way
through
a
decision
by
an
administrative
law
judge.
during
that
18
months
she
continually
represented
that
she
was
totally
and
completely
disabled
from
all
work
in
the
national
economy.
her
social
security
administration
benefits
were
denied
on
three
occasions.
each
time
they
told
her
that
she
could
do
other
work.
one,
she
could
be
a
kitchen
helper
or
she
could
be
a
laundry
folder.
mr.
stephen
g.
morrison
this
is
after,
justice
ginsburg,
after
she
went
back
to
work,
and
after
she
left
work
the
second
time
she
said
she
had
been
continuously
disabled
back
to
january
the
7th
of
1994.
her
representations
are
not
just
that
i'm
disabled
now,
but
that
i
have
been
continuously
disabled
for
the
past
18
months.
so
her
circumstances
are
that
when
the
rebuttable
presumption
comes
in...
and
it's
an
ideal
case
for
it...
the
rebuttable
presumption
comes
in
and
she
is
then
required
to
say
why
these
representations
that
she's
been
continually
and
completely
disabled
from
all
work
in
the
national
economy
and
from
her
past
job
are
no
longer
true.
she
was
unable
to
do
that.
in
fact,
she
brought
the
ada
suit
two
days
before
the
administrative
judge--
mr.
stephen
g.
morrison
--the
point
of
the
estoppel
is
that
she
has
made
a
statement
under
oath
binding
on
her,
that
she
should
be
bound
by
her
word
unless--
mr.
stephen
g.
morrison
--exactly.
it's
also
in
the
interest,
justice
scalia,
of--
mr.
stephen
g.
morrison
--exactly
my
point.
mr.
stephen
g.
morrison
justice
breyer,
let
me
narrow
slightly
this
issue.
in
this
case,
and
i
think
it's
important,
what
mrs.
cleveland
is
saying
is
that
she
was
able
to
work
with
a
reasonable
accommodation
in
april
after
her
stroke.
she
is
now
saying
that
she
was
continuously
disabled
back
to
january
7th.
those
statements
are
inconsistent
and
she
is
bound
by
that
statement.
and
under
those
circumstances,
the
rebuttable
presumption
should
come
into
play
and
she
should
be
required
to
explain
that
in
some
way.
if
she
cannot--
mr.
stephen
g.
morrison
--justice
o'connor,
i
believe
that
their
feeling
at
that
time
in
making
that
statement
was
that
the
vast
majority
of
these
cases
where
you're
totally
disabled
would
not
allow
for
the
accommodation.
mr.
stephen
g.
morrison
justice
o'connor,
under
those
circumstances,
where
you're
taking
that
language
and
pushing
it
to
the
suggestion
that,
on
the
spectrum
analysis,
that
you'd
almost
never
be
able
to
recover,
we
do
not
articulate
that
as
a
standard.
mr.
stephen
g.
morrison
we
don't
defend
that
specific
language
way
out
there.
however,
i
believe
this
tool
that
they've
created
is
right
in
the
center
and
that
that
dicta,
while
it
is...
while
it
is
very
high
rhetoric,
if
you
will,
if
you
apply
the
tools
that
they've
created,
it
allows
for
some
cases
to
be
left
available
and
other
cases
to
not
be
left
available.
so
that
what
we
have
then
is--
mr.
stephen
g.
morrison
--justice
o'connor,
i
don't
believe
they
did
more,
and
it
may
be
because
they
were
dealing
with
this
case.
in
this
case
there
was
not
only
a
showing
that
she
was
disabled
and
completely
disabled
and
that
she
had
sworn
to
that
over
a
period
of
18
months,
that
she
was
disabled
back
to
her
stroke
date,
but
there
was
also
a
showing
in
the
file
underlying
that
accommodation
would
not
be
available
to
her.
she
actually
showed
evidence
in
the
record
that,
number
one,
the
computer
training,
which
she
said
might
accommodate
her,
she
tried
computer
training
in
october
of
1994
for
two
weeks
and
she
said
she
couldn't
absorb
what
the
teacher
was
saying
and
couldn't
write
down
the
notes,
just
the
same
problem
she
had
in
doing
her
job
on
the
telephone.
mr.
stephen
g.
morrison
well,
there
were
two...
i
am,
yes,
sir.
mr.
stephen
g.
morrison
what
i
meant
was
yes.
mr.
stephen
g.
morrison
your
honor,
it
would
change
the
summary
judgment
matrix
to
the
degree
that
someone
could
not
simply
come
in
and
say,
i
didn't
mean
that
before.
in
other
words,
they're
presumed
to
be
bound
by
that
in
the
absence
of
a
credible
evidence,
admissible
evidence
explanation.
mr.
stephen
g.
morrison
justice
kennedy,
the
primary
goal
is
to
focus
on
the
search
for
the
truth,
and
in
that
you
cannot
ignore
past
statements
under
oath.
and
so
the
secondary
goal--
mr.
stephen
g.
morrison
--it's
more
than
an
admission
against
interest,
in
the
sense
that
it
has
been
made
in
a
judicial
body,
a
position
has
been
taken
that
is
contrary
to
the
current
position
being
taken.
mr.
stephen
g.
morrison
yes,
justice
scalia.
mr.
stephen
g.
morrison
the
reason
for
that
is
that
she
has
made...
she
has
gone
down
a
path
of
consistently
telling
one
set
of
facts
that
are
inconsistent
with
the
current
set
of
facts.
this
is
more
than
just
a
factual
inquiry.
mr.
stephen
g.
morrison
yes,
justice
kennedy,
we
are
attempting
to
vindicate
it.
but
we
are
also
attempting
in
this
process
to
give
the
plaintiff
a
reasonable
opportunity,
which
i
think
is
what's
so
important,
to
explain
it.
it's
only
after
that
explanation
is
not
available
that
you
vindicate
the
process.
you
give
that
opportunity
under
the
rebuttable
presumption.
mr.
stephen
g.
morrison
it
is,
justice
o'connor,
theoretically
in
the
balance.
however,
if
she's
taken
the
position
in
her
proceeding
that
she
cannot
be
accommodated--
mr.
stephen
g.
morrison
--justice
ginsburg,
none
of
that
was
hidden,
and
what
she
said
during
that
whole
proceeding
is,
i
can't
be
accommodated,
essentially,
and
i've
been
totally
disabled
back
to
january
7th.
when
she
came
into
the
ada
she
said,
oh
i'm
sorry,
i
really
wasn't
totally
disabled
during
april
and
may
of
that
year.
mr.
stephen
g.
morrison
the
employer,
my
position,
yes,
your
honor,
is--
mr.
stephen
g.
morrison
--yes,
and
then
she
reapplied
and
made
several
assertions
that
she
not
only
was
disabled
after
she
was
terminated
from
her
job,
but
that
she
had
been
disabled
during
the
entire
time
from
all
work
in
the
national
economy.
mr.
stephen
g.
morrison
yes.
mr.
stephen
g.
morrison
yes.
mr.
stephen
g.
morrison
yes.
mr.
stephen
g.
morrison
that's
the
point,
justice
ginsburg.
what
she's
now
saying
in
the
ada
proceeding
is,
time
out,
i'm
sorry,
i
didn't
really
mean
it,
i
wasn't
really
disabled
during
april,
may,
and
june.
mr.
stephen
g.
morrison
yes.
mr.
stephen
g.
morrison
yes.
mr.
stephen
g.
morrison
right.
mr.
stephen
g.
morrison
to
try
to
go
back
to
work,
yes,
ma'am.
mr.
stephen
g.
morrison
justice
ginsburg,
what
she's
saying
is,
i
am
disabled
and
have
been
disabled
for
the
past
18
months,
and
she
says
that
under
oath
consistently,
i
am
and
i
have
been.
and
then
she
sued
us
and
she
said
to
us,
she
said,
i
haven't
been
disabled
for
the
past
18
months,
in
fact
i
was
able
to
work
with
an
accommodation.
it's
totally
contrary
to
everything
she
had
said
before.
mr.
stephen
g.
morrison
it's
through
step
five.
mr.
stephen
g.
morrison
justice
souter,
it
is
not
sufficient
to
say
that
this
case
involves
just
the
language
on
the
record.
it
is
much
more
substantive
than
that,
and
i
think
the
better
answer
to
that
is
that
she
is
required
under
the
social
security
act
to
tell
her
condition
as
only
she
can
tell
it.
and
what
she
said
is,
i
can't
process
information
and
data.
she
was
a
telephone
operator
taking
telephone
information
constantly
and
writing
reports
on
that.
she
couldn't
take
in
the
information,
process
it
through
the
aphasia
that
had
occurred
on
the
stroke,
and
put
it
down
on
a
piece
of
paper.
that's
what
she
could
not
do.
she
consistently
said,
i
can't
do
it.
in
september
of
1994
she
said,
i
can't
do
it
back
to
january
7th
of
1994.
she
tried
to
work,
she
failed.
she
said,
i
can't
work
because
of
my
condition,
her
aphasia,
her
stroke.
and
then
she
went
on
to
say
that
11
times.
in
addition
to
that,
when
they
said,
you
can
do
work
as
a
kitchen
helper
or
a
laundry
folder,
she
said,
no,
i
can't,
i
can't
even
do
that
work.
she
then
proceeded
to
go
to
an
administrative
law
judge,
who
said,
looking
at
your
five
doctors
and
your
three
rehab
specialists
who
say
you're
totally
disabled
and
you
cannot
be
rehabilitated
and
your
own
testimony
that
you
cannot
be
rehabilitated,
i
agree.
two
days
before
that
order
came
out,
she
sued
us
under
the
americans
with
disabilities
act
saying,
i
can
be
accommodated
or
i
could
have
been
during
that
last
18
months.
it's
not
that
i
can
be
accommodated
in
the
future.
she's
got
an
absolute
inconsistency
here
that
has
to
be
dealt
with.
mr.
stephen
g.
morrison
exactly,
exactly.
so
when
we
look
at
this
matter
altogether
and
we
begin
to
focus
on
what
the
individual
test
would
require
in
this
case,
we
find
that
she's
made
this
series
of
statements,
and
then
you
come
back
to
her
statement
in
the
ada
case
and
it's
completely
inconsistent.
then
the
court
has
to
deal
with
that
tension,
that
obvious
tension.
how
do
they
do
that?
they
work
with
what
should
be
a
reasonable
rebuttable
presumption,
basically
giving
full
credit
to
her
statements
under
oath.
mr.
stephen
g.
morrison
well,
the
social
security
administration
should
be
upset
about
anyone
who's
taking
contrary
positions
because
they
have
an
administrative
quasi
judicial
proceeding.
the
courts
and
the
social
security
administration
should
be
upset
with
anyone
who
takes
contrary
positions
between
two
federal
agencies.
mr.
stephen
g.
morrison
no,
justice
ginsburg,
it's
completely
in
sync
with
the
meaning
and
point
of
the
act.
number
one,
the
social
security
administration
says,
tell
the
truth
about
your
condition,
tell
the
truth
from
the
beginning.
mr.
stephen
g.
morrison
yes.
mr.
stephen
g.
morrison
justice
o'connor,
you
could,
you
could
come
under
part
three
of
the
test
and
say
that,
i
fall
within
a
statutory
disability.
however,
if
you
go
to
part
four
you're
saying,
i
cannot
do
the
essential
job
functions
of
my
last
job.
and
if
you
go
to
part
five
you're
saying,
i
cannot
do
any
work
in
the
national
economy
that's
available
in
significant
numbers,
given
my
age,
etcetera.
so
what
she
has
done
in
this
case
and
what
the
fifth
circuit
was
struggling
with
was
what
to
do
under
those
circumstances.
and
the
fifth
circuit
specifically
said
that
if
there
is
a
blindness
or
if
there
is
two
legs
that
are
unavailable
that
that
person
could
be
an
exception.
mr.
stephen
g.
morrison
thank
you
very
much.
