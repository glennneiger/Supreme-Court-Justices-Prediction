mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
could
i
have
some
water?
thanks.
i
think
it
would
be
more
important
and
more
useful
for
me
to
focus
on
the
interaction
of
the
precise
statutory
provisions
of
this
act
rather
than
to
dwell
too
long
on
the
boiler
plate
background
provisions
of,
for
example,
section
201(b)
where
i'm
afraid
i
read
it
as
the
chief
justice
does,
as
limited
to
its
context.
it's
quite
clear
that
when
congress
takes
the
trouble
that
it
did
here
to
provide
with
great
precision
for
who
shall
have
jurisdiction
to
do
what--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--well,
it
took
me
a
while--
[laughter]
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
not...
not,
justice
scalia,
as
great
elegance.
[laughter]
but
let
me
try
to
say
why
i
think
it
precise.
section
251
imposes,
quite
clearly,
a
duty
on
all
incumbent
lec's
to
provide
various
things,
interconnection,
unbundled
access,
resale...
to
provide
them
at
just
and
reasonable
rates
in
accordance
with
the
requirements
of
252.
now,
that
i
think
is
unambiguous.
that's
precise.
if
you
look
at
252,
it
in
turn
quite
precisely
says
the
state
commissions...
not
the
fcc,
but
the
state
commissions...
shall
establish
those
rates
according...
and
i
quote
it...
to
section
252(d).
now,
252(d)
in
turn
spells
out
what
the
state
commissions,
quote,
determinations
of
the
just
and
reasonable
rates
for
purposes
of
section
251
shall
be
based
on.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
justice
stevens,
with
all
respect,
i
do
not
agree
with
that.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
well,
in
section
261(b)
and
261(c),
it's
quite
clear
that
rulemaking
authority
is
contemplated,
and
indeed
the
preemptive
structure
established
there
shows
that
we're
talking
about
state
regulations.
261(b),
for
example,
says
that
nothing
in
this
part
shall
be
construed
to
prohibit
a
state
commission
from
enforcing
regulations
prescribed
before
a
certain
date
or
from
prescribing
regulations
after
the
date
of
enactment...
and
listen
to
this...
in
fulfilling
the
requirements
of
this
part,
that
is,
251
to
61,
if
such
regulations
are
not
inconsistent
with
its
provisions.
and
if
you
look--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--well,
with
the
provisions.
but
notice
how
that
differs,
justice
stevens,
from
the
next
section.
that
is,
those
things
that
fulfill
the
act
are
to
be
tested
only
against
the
provisions
of
the
statute.
those,
however,
which
go
beyond
are
to
be
not
inconsistent...
the
end
of
261(c)...
with
this
part
or
the
commission's
regulations
to
implement
this
part.
and
if
you
combine
that
with
251(d)(3),
i
think
you
can
see
what
the...
what
structure
here
emerges.
if
you
look
at
251(d)(3)(a),
in
prescribing
and
enforcing
regs
to
implement
the
requirements
of
this
section,
the
commission...
that
is,
the
fcc...
shall
not
preclude
the
enforcement
of
any
regulation,
order,
or
policy
of
a
state
commission
that
establishes
access
and
interconnection
obligations
of
local
exchange
carriers.
and
it's
clear
in--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--of
this
section,
but
no
reference
to
regulations
of
the
fcc,
and
nothing
in
the
section
precludes
the
commissions
from
carrying
out
the
duty.
let
me
just--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--the
state
commissions
have
rulemaking
authority
contemplated
by
this
act
to
implement
it
including
doing
what
they
are
told
they
must
do
in
252(d)(1).
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
i
think
they
are
promulgating
state
standards
to
implement
a
general
federal
principle.
that
is,
the
federal
rule
under
252(d)
says
what
the
standards
must
achieve.
it
says
that
they
must
be
based
on
cost,
that
they
can
include
profit,
that
they
should
not
be
old
style
ratemaking
standards.
within
that
broad
framework,
there
is
room
left
for
the
50
states
to
interpret
that
in
somewhat
different
ways.
you
don't
need
chevron
deference.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
i
don't
think
so,
justice
scalia.
if
the
federal
government
says
that
certain
functions
are
to
be
carried
out
by
state
commissions,
as
this
law
does,
and
that
they
are
to
carry
them
out
to
achieve
certain...
within
certain
parameters...
they
must
use
costs...
you
have
a
federal
standard
applied
by
the
federal
district
court,
on
review
of
the
commission,
see
if
they
have
complied
with
that.
but
50
states
can
have
50
somewhat
different
conceptions
of
what--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--i
don't
think
that's
yet
clear,
justice
ginsburg,
because
so
far,
as
you
know,
most
of
them,
as
you
pointed
out,
are
using
telric
or
something
very
close
to
it.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
that's
right,
and
the
limit--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--the
federal
judiciary
ultimately.
that
is,
this
was
passed
by
a
congress--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--that's
what--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--well,
but
it's
not
unique,
justice
ginsburg.
there
is,
for
example,
the
hinshaw
amendment
in
the
natural
gas
area,
17
u.s.c.,
section
717
(c),
and
there
are
other
provisions
in
this
statute
dealing
with
border
towns
and
pole
attachment
rates
and
rural
exemptions
where
it's
clear
that
congress
was
doing
something
a
bit
different.
it
was,
though,
not
unique.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
i
think,
justice
scalia--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--the
concept
of
cost
is
ultimately
up
to
the
federal
judiciary
to
determine.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
but
some
concepts
have
latitude.
that
is,
there
are
a
lot
of
different...
if
i
say--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--like
the
concept
of
cost.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
it
has
latitude.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
but...
but
it
has
borders.
i
still
think--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--well,
the
difference
i
think,
justice
scalia,
is
that
in
the
chevron
context,
one
would
tell
the
governing
federal
agency
that
within
a
permissible
range
of
meanings,
we're
not
going
to
decide
what
it
means.
we're
actually
going
to
let
you
decide
what
it
means.
that's
different
from
saying
we
decide
what
it
means.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
right.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
but
that's...
that
i
think
is
unclear.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
that's
right.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
justice
breyer,
there's
nothing
in
this
intricate
statute--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--that
gives
the
commission
authority
to
speak
to
the
issue
of
reasonableness
of
rates,
because
even
though
the
words
appear
in
that
general
section--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--but
then
there
is
section
253,
which
says
that
when
a
particular
system
of
any
kind,
not
just
about
rates,
when
a
policy
or
order
or
regulation
has
been
promulgated
by
a
state
and
when
you
can
show,
when
the
commission
can
show
after
notice
and
hearing
that
it,
that
particular
one,
will
operate
as
an
impermissible
barrier
to
competition,
then
it
may
be
preempted,
says
the
statute,
but
only
to
the
extent
necessary
to
cure
the
violation.
it
seems
to
me--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--i
think,
justice
breyer,
as
long
as
it
does
that
not
ex
ante
and
across
the
board,
but
by
looking
at
a
particular
action
of
a
state,
then
it's
operating
within
the
ambit
of
the
statute.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
but
this
statute
rejects
i
think
very
clearly
anything
that
resembles
a
kind
of
prior
restraint
invalidation
across
the
board
of
some
set
of
rates.
and
if
ratemaking
were
delegated
to
the
states
here
only
for
purposes
of
arbitrations
in
252(c),
then
perhaps
you
could
understand
the
distinction
the
sg
is
making
between
rulemaking,
which
he
says
is
for
us,
although
as
he
admits
when
pressed,
the
rules
can
get
right
down
to
the
last
details,
the
way
their
proxy
prices
did,
where
they
averaged
from
six
states
and
applied
specifics...
basically
he's
saying
rulemaking
is
for
us
and
applying
is
for
you.
but
if
you
look
at
252(d),
it's
very
clear
that
when
the
states
set
prices,
they
are
doing
it,
quote,
for
purposes
of
section
251,
not
for
arbitrations,
but
for
251,
which
is
the
generic
provision
defining
the
obligations
of
the
incumbent
lec's--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--and
indeed,
also
for
251(f).
that
is,
their
dilemma
about
section
271
is
solved
by
251(f).
in
271,
at
what
they
call
the
back
end,
the
fcc
has
to
decide
whether
a
bell
operating
company
that
wants
to
go
into
long
distance
has
complied
with
the
rate
regulations.
but
it's
got
to
comply
with
the
rate
regulations
and
rules
promulgated
by
the
states
because
the
state
commissions--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--well,
the
way--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--under
253(d)
the
mechanism
is
described.
if
after
notice
and
an
opportunity
for
comment,
the
commission
determines
that
a
state
or
local
government
has
permitted
or
imposed
any
statute,
regulation,
or
legal
requirement
that
violates
subsection
(a)
which
talks
about
excluding
competition,
then
its
enforcement
may
be...
the
enforcement
of
such
statute,
regulation,
or
requirement,
to
the
extent
necessary
to
correct
such
violation
or
inconsistency,
shall
be
preempted.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
well,
in
this
area,
i
think
if
you
immerse
yourself
in
this
statute,
what
happens
is
that
the
fcc
is
permitted
essentially
in
this
limited
special
area
of
rates...
and
there
are
a
few
others
in
the
statute
like
it...
not
its
customary
role
of
promulgating
regulations,
but
to
the
role
of
backstop--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--intervening
in
particular
cases.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
well,
with
respect
to
terms
and
conditions
and
as
to
rates,
perhaps--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--but
i
suppose
the
word
nondiscriminatory
could
apply
to
rates,
but
in
determining
what
is
just
and
reasonable,
the
statute
says
that
that's
to
be
done
in
accord
with
the
standards
of
252(d),
and
that's
with
the
state
commissions.
but
there
was
one
point
that
i
was
trying
to
make
a
bit
earlier
that
i
want
to
come
back
to--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--right.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
but
i
think,
justice
scalia,
that
the
only
way
to
give
coherent
meaning
to
these
provisions
is
to
understand
that
when
it
refers
to
the
requirements
of
this
section,
of
251,
it's
not
saying
this
section
and
any
regulations
promulgated
thereunder.
this
statute
draws
that
distinction
repeatedly;
10
times
i
believe
it
refers
to
section
251
and
regulations
promulgated
thereunder.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
here
it
does
not.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
thank
you.
