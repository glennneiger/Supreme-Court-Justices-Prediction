mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
would
like
to
make
two
points.
the
potential
competitors
have
challenged
the
eighth
circuit's
jurisdictional
ruling
because
the
inevitable
and
now
demonstrated
effect
of
that
ruling
has
been
to
severely
undermine
the
prospects
for
rapid
competition,
which
was
the
principal
purpose
of
this
act.
because
state
commissions
had
first
to
determine
the
meaning
of
the
federal
rate
requirements
before
they
could
establish
particular
rates,
they
failed
to
meet
the
9-month
deadline
for
establishing
rates
required
by
congress.
moreover,
there
are
already
hundreds
of
federal
district
court
challenges
to
the
state
arbitration
decisions,
and
the
vast
majority
of
them
specifically
challenge
the
rate
methodologies
employed
by
the
states.
until
all
of
those
challenges
are
finally
resolved
after
appeals,
potential
competitors
cannot
even
know
how
much
they
would
have
to
pay
for
access
and
interconnection.
this
already
substantial
delay,
and
the
delays
still
ahead
regarding
multi
billion
dollar
investment
decisions,
has
seriously
frustrated
the
act's
central
purpose.
a
construction
of
the
act
that
so
frustrates
the
principal
purpose
of
the
act
cannot
be
right.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
the
great
majority
of
the
state
commissions
on
their
own
have
adopted
telric
or
some
other
forward
looking
cost
scheme
rather
than
historical
embedded
costs,
but
not
all
have.
and
those
state
decisions
have
been
challenged
in
federal
district
courts.
they
could
be
reversed.
until
that
whole
process
is
over,
the
process
of
rapid
competition
is
on
hold.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
justice
breyer,
let
me
respond
to
that
by
saying,
first,
congress
has
itself
expressly
in
the
statute
taken
away
from
the
states
their
historic
function
of
deciding
rates
based
on
rate
of
return
proceedings.
the
statute
says
that
itself.
congress
has
already
overturned
state
prerogatives
and
has
preempted
the
state
laws
that
barred
local
competition.
second,
the
issue
of
the
telric
method
is
not
presently
before
the
court.
the
merits
of
that
have
not
been
reached
because
of
the
court...
eighth
circuit's
jurisdictional
ruling.
third,
if
it
were
before
the
court,
the
telric
method
leaves
the
states
very
substantial
discretion.
it
allows
them
to
determine
depreciation
methods,
which
this
court
in
louisiana
said
was
a
very
significant
component
of
the
ratemaking
process.
it
allows
the
states
to
determine
joint
and
common
cost
allocation
issues.
it
allows
the
states
to
determine
the
level
of
profit
on
those
costs.
in
fact,
telric
itself--
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
--justice
scalia,
as
far
as
fcc's
jurisdiction
is
concerned,
that's
correct.
then
there
would
be
the
question
whether
the
exercise
of
that
jurisdiction
on
the
merits
went
too
far,
it
so
interfered
with
the
clear
intent
of
congress,
that
the
states
have
a
parallel
role
in
this
process,
that
it
would
violate
the
clear
language
of
the
statute.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
well,
in
fact--
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
--in
fact,
justice
scalia,
i
think
your
point
about
earlier
and
later
is
a
very
important
point,
but
i
see
it
a
little
differently.
solicitor
general
waxman
made
the
point
that
section
271
requires
the
fcc
itself
to
determine
whether
252(d)
has
been
fully
implemented.
252(d)
relates
only
to
rates.
clearly
congress
understood
that,
at
least
at
the
back
end,
the
fcc
had
the
authority
to
determine
the
meaning
of
the
federal
rate
requirements.
why
would
congress
give
the
fcc
that
authority
at
the
back
end,
but
withhold
that
very
same
authority
at
the
front
end
when
fcc
interpretations
could
meaningfully
speed
the
negotiation
and
arbitration
process
and
thereby
further
the
principal
purpose
of
the
act?
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
well--
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
--well,
i
wouldn't
want
to
prejudge
how
the
court
would
come
out
on
the
merits,
your
honor,
but
let
me--
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
--i
think
the
reason
is
the
reason
i
just
gave.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
well,
perhaps
i
didn't
understand
your
question,
justice
scalia.
the
point
i
was
trying
to
make
is
that
section
271
and,
in
fact,
section
252(e)(6)
and
section
160
and
numerous
sections
of
the
act
plainly
require
the
fcc
itself,
at
some
point
in
the
process,
to
determine
the
meaning
of
the
federal
rate
requirements,
a
traditional
authority
for
a
federal
agency
interpreting
federal
law
that
is
supposed
to
be,
as
the
conference
report
says,
nationally
uniform.
why
would
congress
want
to
give
that...
that
very
clear
authority
to
the
fcc
at
the
back
end
of
the
process
and
withhold
it
at
the
beginning?
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
well,
not
as
a
matter
of
jurisdiction.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
but
then
under
chevron
deference,
whether
on
the
merits
that
was
appropriate
or
not
is
exactly
the
question
that
this
court
is
going
to
decide
in
the
second
hour
of
the
argument.
the
fcc
has--
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
--justice
souter,
i
think
the
fcc,
as
a
jurisdictional
matter,
would
have
the
authority
to
set
particular
rates
if
he
thought...
if
it
thought
that
was
necessary
in
order
to
ensure
local
competition,
just
as
it
has
the
authority
under--
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
--yes,
it
would,
your
honor.
at
the
back
end,
it
clearly
has
it.
under
253,
if
the
states
set
rates
that
the
fcc
concludes
are
anti
competitive
rates,
it
can
squarely
preempt
those
rates,
and
i
think
it
would
have
the
same
jurisdictional
authority
at
the
front
end.
whether
on
the
merits
it
would
be
okay
under
chevron
deference
is
a
different
question.
let
me
just
point
out
in
my
remaining
time
that
there
are
other
interpretive
anomalies
that
flow
from
the
eighth
circuit's
ruling.
first,
if
the
eighth
circuit's
ruling
were
correct,
the
very
same
phrase,
quote,
the
requirements
of
section
251,
would
have
to
mean
radically
different
things
in
section
251
which
discusses
the
regulatory
responsibilities
of
the
fcc
than
it
means
in
section
252
discussing
the
judicial
responsibilities
of
federal
district
courts.
252
requires
that
all
state
arbitration
decisions
can
be
reviewed
by
federal
district
courts.
federal
district
courts
are
supposed
to
determine
whether
there
has
been
compliance
with,
quote,
the
requirements
of
section
251.
plainly
that
means
all
of
the
requirements
of
section
251.
but
when
talking
about
the
regulatory
responsibilities
of
the
fcc,
the
eighth
circuit
had
to
construe
that
very
same
phrase
to
mean
only
those
requirements
of
section
251
which
themselves
call
for
fcc
involvement.
that's
a
conflict.
furthermore,
section
271
also
makes
clear
that
cannot
be
correct
because
271
requires
the
fcc
to
determine
whether
there's
been
full
compliance
with
section
251(c)(2)
and
(c)(3),
and
that
cannot
mean
only
those
requirements
of
(c)(2)
and
(c)(3)
that
call
for
fcc
involvement
because
those
provisions
do
not
themselves
call
for
fcc
involvement.
my
time
is
up.
thank
you
very
much.
