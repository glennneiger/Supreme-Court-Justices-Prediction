justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
a
question
about
252?
it
plainly
gives
the
states
authority
to
fix
rates
in
certain
circumstances,
but
it
does
that,
as
i
understand
it,
only
when
it's
resolving
arbitration
disputes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
in
doing
so,
it
is
to
apply
a
federal
standard,
is
it
not?
the
states
are
to
apply
a
federal
standard.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
their...
whether
they've
applied
it
correctly
or
incorrectly
is
subject
to
review
by
the
federal
district
court.
justice
john
paul
stevens
now,
is
this...
does
that...
and
this
is
in
a
procedural
section,
252,
whereas
the
requirements
are
in
251.
now,
is
it
your...
is
it
your
thought
that
the
federal...
basic
federal
standards
that
must
be
applied
are
already
in
the
statute
or
that
nobody
is
to
implement
them
with
further
rulemaking.
can
the
fcc
do
it,
the
states
do
it,
or
nobody?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
that's
not
quite
responsive
to
my
question.
my
question
is,
does
the
statute
contemplate
further
rulemaking
to
define
the
methodology
for
ratemaking
in
greater
detail
than
is
already
found
in
the
statute?
and
if
so,
who
is
to
be
the
rulemaker
under
your
view
of
the
statute?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so,
the
only
learning
about
the
meaning
of
the
federal
standard
is
in
the
statute
itself
without
further
guidance.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
here,
as
i
understand
it,
the
252
gives
the
state
agencies
jurisdiction
just
in
an
adjudicatory
way.
they're
resolving
specific
disputes
that
arise
out
of
arbitrations.
so,
they
are
basically
adjudicators
within
the
scheme
of
the
statute.
justice
john
paul
stevens
follow
the
federal
standard.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
you
do
agree,
ms.
munns,
do
you
not,
that
insofar
as
2(b)
refers
to
what...
how
far
the
act
shall
apply,
that
it's
been
repealed?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
therefore,
that
that
portion
of
2(b)
is
no
longer
have
any
meaning
in
this
case.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no.
i
was
just
asking
insofar
as
it
talks
about
where
it
applies,
you
agree
the
'96
act
does
apply
in
a
manner
that's
inconsistent
with
the
language
of
2(b).
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
tribe,
is
it
not
significant
that
they
are
given
that
statutory
duty
in
the
context
of
resolving
arbitrations?
they
are
not
given
that
statutory
duty
in
the
context
of
rulemaking.
justice
john
paul
stevens
now,
what
in
the
statute...
what
in
the
statute
gives
them
rulemaking
authority
with
regard
to
pricing?
justice
john
paul
stevens
that's
the
key
point.
that's
the
key
point:
if
not
inconsistent
with
the
provisions.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
is
consistent
with
the
requirements
of
this
section.
justice
john
paul
stevens
let
me
ask...
let
me
ask
one
question
just
to
summarize
it,
mr.
tribe,
because
i
want
to
be
sure
i
understand
your
position.
is
it
your
view
that
in...
that
beyond
the
statutory
provisions
that
do
impose
certain
requirements,
certain
standards,
federal
standards,
on
pricing
that
there
is
no
agency
that
has
further
rulemaking
authority,
that
it's
a
federal
agency,
or
it's
state
agencies?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
are
they
then
promulgating
in
your
view
federal
standards
or
state
standards?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but,
mr.
tribe,
that--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--that
isn't
a
fair
reading
of
251(c)(2)(d)
because
(c)(2)(d)
refers
to
the
interconnection
on
rates,
terms,
and
conditions
that
are
just
and
reasonable,
and
that's
in
251
itself.
and
i
think
it's...
everyone
seems
to
agree
that...
that
the
fcc
has
rulemaking
authority
with
respect
to
251.
justice
john
paul
stevens
rates,
terms
and
conditions
that
are
just,
reasonable,
and
nondiscriminatory.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
barr,
can
i
just
ask
for
help?
you're
referring
to
278
of
the
order?
justice
john
paul
stevens
where
in
the
papers
is
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
it
in
the
petitioners'
appendix?
they
seemed
to
have
skipped
those
paragraphs.
justice
john
paul
stevens
joint
appendix.
thank
you.
it's
not
in
the
other.
justice
john
paul
stevens
could
you
help
us
again?
where
is
that
in
the
materials?
justice
john
paul
stevens
oh,
of
the...
you're
referring
to
the
statute.
