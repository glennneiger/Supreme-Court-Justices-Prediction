ms.
diane
munns
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
congress
created
a
national
framework
but...
to
bring
competition
to
the
local
markets,
but
did
not
delegate
full
authority
to
the
federal
communications
commission.
it
defined
states
the
duty
to
set
prices
when
parties
can
agree,
and
it
specifically
left
section
2(b)
and
the
dual
jurisdictional
scheme
in
tact
under
the
telecommunications
act.
so,
where
the
statute
is
clear
is
in
section
252
with
respect
to
pricing.
the
language
must
be
given
full
effect.
if
there
is
an
ambiguity
in
the
statute,
then
congress
intended
for
the
dual
jurisdictional
scheme
to
continue.
ms.
diane
munns
that
is
correct.
ms.
diane
munns
it
is.
it
is
applying
federal
standards.
ms.
diane
munns
and
that's
correct.
ms.
diane
munns
it's
our
position
that
the
standards
are
in
section
252.
they're
in
section
252(d),
but
they
are
to
be
implemented
in
the
arbitration
proceedings
when
the
facts
are
brought
forward
to
the
state
commissions.
ms.
diane
munns
not
the
fcc.
the
fcc
has
no
authority
under
252.
ms.
diane
munns
yes,
i
think
the
state--
ms.
diane
munns
--yes,
i
believe
that
the
states
could
do
that.
ms.
diane
munns
now,
that's
an
interesting
question
because
those
would
be
under
the
state's
administrative
procedures
act.
ms.
diane
munns
yes,
that's
correct.
ms.
diane
munns
yes.
ms.
diane
munns
yes,
you
could,
your
honor.
ms.
diane
munns
and
many
different
decisions
under
the
federal
standards
that
are
in
section
252.
congress
set
those
standards
and
set
very
broad
standards
and
assigned
to
the
states
the
jurisdiction
to
do
the
pricing
in
the
arbitrations.
ms.
diane
munns
i
don't
think
with
respect...
you
know,
what
the
federal
courts
are
to
look
at
when
they
look
at
those
arbitration
decisions
is
to
see
whether
or
not
they're
in
compliance
with
the
statute,
and
with
respect
to
questions
of
law,
there
would
be
no
deference.
ms.
diane
munns
i
think
that's
a
question
that's
being
litigated
in
the
courts
right
now,
as
those
arbitrations
go
through
the
federal
district
courts.
ms.
diane
munns
well,
i
don't...
i
don't
think
that...
that
that's
necessarily
right.
i
believe
that
this
is
a
federal
statute
and
that
the...
that
congress
wanted
review
to
be
at
the
federal
courts
to
assure
some
uniformity
in
the--
ms.
diane
munns
--and
i'm
not
aware
of
any
scheme
like
this,
but--
ms.
diane
munns
--yes.
i'm
not
aware
of--
ms.
diane
munns
--they
are
adjudicators,
but
the
standards
are
also
in
section
252.
and
when
it
gives
the
state
commissions
that
duty,
it
says
for
the
purposes
of
setting
just
and
reasonable
rates--
ms.
diane
munns
--for
section
251,
and
it
makes
no
reference
to
federal
standards.
ms.
diane
munns
section
252(c)
that
you're
referring
to
says
that
when
the
state
is
making
a
decision
in
an
arbitration,
it
must
look
to
make
sure
that
the
decision
is
in
compliance
with
section
251,
including
the
fcc's
regulations
under
252
and
the
standards
under
section
252(d).
there's
no
reference
to
any
kind
of
commission
regulations
with
respect
to
those
pricing
standards.
ms.
diane
munns
well,
section
251(d)
is
not
a
grant
of
authority
to
the
fcc.
what
it
says
is
it
must
do...
must
complete
its
rulemaking
within
a
6-month
period
to
meet
the
requirements
of
that
section.
as
i
said,
the...
the
standards,
the
pricing
standards,
for
state
commissions
to
follow
are...
are
in
section
252.
they're
not
in
section
251.
it
says,
for
purposes
of
setting
just
and
reasonable
rates
for
section
251(c),
the
state
commissions
shall,
and
then
it
sets
out
those
pricing
standards.
the
fcc
doesn't
have
a
role
with
respect
to
pricing
unless
the
state
fails
to
act.
in
that
case,
then
the
fcc
may
step
forward.
ms.
diane
munns
and...
and
it's
our
position
that
the
fcc
does
have
authority
with
respect
when...
251(d)
says--
ms.
diane
munns
--i
think
that
when...
when
congress
in
252
said
that
the
state
commissions
shall
establish
for...
shall
set
rates
for
the
purposes
of
section
251,
that
it
became
clear
that
the
state
commissions
were
to
do
that.
when
you
look
at
section
251(d),
the
rulemaking
just
goes
for
the
requirements
of
this
section.
that
kind
of
reading
is
required
under
section
2(b)
of
the
act.
any
authority
that's
granted
to
the
fcc
must
be
expressed
straightforward
and
unambiguous
under
the
rule
that
you
set
in
louisiana.
so,
when...
if
there
is
no
reference
to
the
fcc,
then
they
have
no
rulemaking
authority.
that's
the
rule
that
was
set
in
louisiana.
ms.
diane
munns
you
know,
your
honor,
these
are
still
dual
use
facilities.
the
1996
act
has
not
changed
that.
these
facilities
have
been...
they
have
interstate
components
and
they
have
intrastate
components.
when
congress
promulgated
the
'96
acts,
they...
they
looked
at
whether
or
not
they
should
retain
the
applicability
of
2(b)
to
the
'96
act.
there
was
a
point
where
it
was
excepted
from
the
title
2
provisions,
the
local
competition
provisions.
when
it
came
out
of
the
conference
committee,
it
was
back
in.
it
is
applicable.
and
that
says,
nothing
in
this
act
shall
be
construed
to
apply
or
to
give
the
fcc
jurisdiction
over
intrastate
matters
unless
they
have
express
and
unambiguous
authority
from
congress.
ms.
diane
munns
in
section--
ms.
diane
munns
--louisiana.
ms.
diane
munns
this
court
in...
no,
i'm
quoting
this
court
in
louisiana.
ms.
diane
munns
that's
an
interpretation
of
2(b)
from
louisiana.
ms.
diane
munns
that...
that
was
what
this
court
has
said
in
louisiana,
that
there
has
to
be
two
parts:
first,
that
the
statute
has
to
apply;
but
secondly,
that
congress
has
to
make
an
assignment
of
an
intrastate
duty
to
the
fcc.
if
you
look
at
other
acts
where
the...
where
congress
has
legislated
in
the
intrastate
areas...
i
take
you
specifically
to
the
cable
act...
congress
both
legislated
in
the
area
and
gave
the
fcc
express
authority.
the
pay
phone
section,
276,
of
this
act.
congress
both
legislated
in
the
area
and
gave
express
authority
to
the
fcc.
ms.
diane
munns
their
argument
is
that--
ms.
diane
munns
--no,
but
louisiana
said
that
2(b)
acts
as
both
a
rule
of
construction
and
a
congressional
denial
of
power
to
the
fcc.
so,
in
order
for
it
to...
for
the
authority
to
apply
and
for
the
fcc
to
have
authority,
the
act
must
both
apply
and
express
delegation
must
be
made
to
the
fcc.
i'd
like
to
point
you
to
section
225(b)(2)
which
is
in
the
telecommunications
services
for
the
hearing...
for
hearing
and
speech
impaired
individuals.
there's
a
section
in
there
where
congress
expressly
made
the
fcc's
authority
co
extensive
with
the
terms
of
the
act.
they
said
all
the
general
authority
that
the
fcc
has
extends
to
this
section.
so,
the
question
is,
why
did
they
take
that
additional
step?
if,
when
congress
legislates
in
an
intrastate
area,
fcc
authority
attaches,
why
was
it
necessary
in
section
225(b)
to
make
that
statement
that
all
their
general
authority
attach?
why
when
the
passed
the
pay
phones
act
did
they
also
make
very
clear
that
it
related
to
both
interstate
and
to
intrastate?
ms.
diane
munns
we
concede
that
the
1996
act
covers
intrastate
matters--
ms.
diane
munns
--no,
that
the
statute
must
both
apply
and
the
fcc
must--
ms.
diane
munns
--no.
no,
i
don't,
your
honor.
thank
you.
