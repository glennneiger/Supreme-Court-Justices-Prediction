justice
antonin
scalia
well,
if
you
applied
that
argument,
then
2(b)
wouldn't
have
kept...
wouldn't
have
kept
the
fcc
out
of
intrastate
phone
rates,
even...
even
before
the
1996
act.
i
mean,
doesn't
that
prove
too
much?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
only
with
regard
to
interstate
calls.
justice
antonin
scalia
don't
you
think
2(b)
has
been
repealed
by
the...
it
is
impossible,
is
it
not,
after
the
1960...
1996
act,
to
give
effect
to
2(b)?
justice
antonin
scalia
why?
how
is
it
possible
to...
not
to
construe
any
provision
of
the
act
to
apply
to
intrastate
communications?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
2(b)
has
its
exceptions
written
in,
except
as
provided
in
sections
223
through
227,
inclusive,
and
section
332,
and
subject
to
301
in
title
6.
nothing
in
this
act
shall
be
construed
to
apply
or
give
the
commission
jurisdiction
with
respect
to,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah.
it's
just
impossible
to
apply
that
anymore.
justice
antonin
scalia
telric
does,
but...
but
if...
if
your
interpretation
of
the
statute
is
correct,
you
would
say
the
fcc
could
prescribe
those
things
as
well.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
why...
why
suddenly
be
worried
about
that
at
that
point?
why
not
be
worried...
worried
about
it
earlier?
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
a
point
of
whether
the
fcc
can
adopt
telric
at
all.
justice
antonin
scalia
that
makes
good
sense,
but
artificially
limiting
it
the
way
you
were
a
moment
ago
doesn't
make
good
sense
it
seems
to
me--
justice
antonin
scalia
--by
saying
that,
well,
you
know,
if
and
when
the
fcc
goes
further
and
doesn't
even
let
the
states
make
these
determinations
as
to
proper
allocations
and
so
forth,
then
we
can
worry
about
those.
it
seems
to
me
if
we
come
out
the
way
you
want
us
now,
we
would
come
out
the
same
way
on
those
issues
later
on.
i
don't
see...
i
don't
see--
justice
antonin
scalia
--give
me
a
good
reason
for...
from
separating
the
one
from
the
other.
justice
antonin
scalia
which
was?
i
didn't
hear
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
can't
imagine,
but
why...
but
why...
the
argument
you
were
making
was
that,
look
it,
telric
doesn't
go
all
the
way.
it
has
reserved
certain
important
questions
to
the
states.
and
my
point
is,
well,
that's
out
of
the
grace
of
the
fcc.
but
the
logic
of
your
argument
is
that
the
fcc
wouldn't
have
had
to
reserve
those
questions
to
the
states.
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
could
the
states
issue
regulations
setting
forth
their
interpretation
of
what
this
says?
federal--
justice
antonin
scalia
--but
they
would
have
to
be
litigated
in...
in
federal
district
court?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
but
they'd
relate
to
the
standards
set
forth
in
the
federal
statute
i
assume.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
assume
those
would
be
federal
questions.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
you
could
have
50
different
states
having
50
different
sets
of
regulations.
justice
antonin
scalia
until
they
were
all
litigated
out
eventually,
you
know.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
but
we
usually
give
the
agency
committed
with
initial
interpretation
of
the
statute
deference.
so,
you
know,
if
it's
within
the
range
of
ambiguity,
we
say
if
you
want
to
pick
it
here,
that's
fine.
now,
can
we
do
that
with
the
states?
maybe
you
can
have...
maybe...
maybe
you
were
too
quick
in
responding
to
my
question
or
maybe
i
was
too
quick
in
answering...
in
asking
it.
maybe
you
can
have
50
different
state
interpretations
of...
of
what
252
requires.
if
we
give
chevron
deference
to
each
of
the
50
states
and
no
one
of
them
is
so
outrageous
as
to
fail
chevron,
i
guess
we
could
have
50
different
interpretations.
justice
antonin
scalia
there
might
be
a
scheme
if
you
didn't
take
the
position
that
the
states
could
issue
regulations.
if
the
states
couldn't
issue
regulations
and
could
only
adjudicate,
you'd
have
a
scheme
like
section
1983
i
guess
where...
where
you
can
sue
in
state
courts,
but
no
regulations
are
issued
by
state
entities.
but
you
can
sue
in
state
court
and
state
judges
would
interpret
1983
i
suppose.
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
could
do
that,
but
you
couldn't
have
any
regulations
coming
out
of
the
states
then.
justice
antonin
scalia
where
does
it
say
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
doesn't
say
any
unless
it's
explicit.
justice
antonin
scalia
are
you
quoting
2(b)?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
see.
justice
antonin
scalia
2(b)
doesn't
really
mean
what
it
says.
it
says...
it
just...
unless
it's
clear,
you
shouldn't
interpret
it
to
allow
authority
over
intrastate
matters.
justice
antonin
scalia
great...
great
precision?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
can
describe
this
piece
of
legislation
as
great
precision?
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
we
don't
need
chevron
deference.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
understand
why
you
say
that
federal
courts
will
determine
them.
it
seems
to
me
you
can't
say,
on
the
one
hand,
the
federal
courts
will
determine
the
meaning
of
cost,
and
on
other
hand,
you
know,
within
the
range
of
ambiguity,
the
states
can
determine
the
meaning
of
the
words.
i
mean,
take
one
position
or
the
other.
justice
antonin
scalia
cost...
does
cost
mean
a
single
thing
that
federal
courts
will
determine
or
is
it
up
to
the
states?
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
justice
antonin
scalia
like
the
concept
of
cost.
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
well,
it
either
has
latitude
or
it
doesn't
have
latitude.
justice
antonin
scalia
okay,
so
it's
up
to
the
states.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
can't
mean
non
costs.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
just
chevron
deference
you're
talking
about.
that's
no
different
from
chevron.
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
it
did
say...
it
doesn't
say
that.
it
says
in
accordance
with
the
terms
and
conditions
of
the
agreement
and
the
requirements
not
just
of
section
252.
and
the
requirements
of
this
section
and
section
252.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
that's
crucial.
justice
antonin
scalia
point
of
technical
feasibility
where
in
the
statute?
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
what
278
says.
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
not?
i
mean,
you
say,
it
impairs
my
ability
to
enter
the
market
if
it...
if...
if
providing
it
by
myself
would
raise
my
rates.
in
other
words,
if
i
can't
get
it
as
cheaply
as
you
can
give
it
to
me,
it
impairs
my
ability
to
enter
the
market.
and
the
only
condition
on
which
i
would
want
it
or
desire
it
is
you
can
give
it
to
me
more
cheaply
than
i
can
develop
it
for
myself.
that
makes
sense.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
long
as
you
take
impair
to
mean,
you
know,
come
at
a
higher
price.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
the
sentence
says,
such
term
also
includes.
now,
you
take
that
second
sentence
to
mean
despite
the...
the
prior
definition?
justice
antonin
scalia
we're
adding
to
it
information
sufficient
for
billing
and
collection?
information
for
billing
and
collection
isn't...
isn't
something
that
is
needful
for
the
provision
of
the
telecommunications
service.
justice
antonin
scalia
wait.
you
say
it's
provided
by
means
of
the
same
equipment
that...
that
enables
you
to
activate
their...
their
service.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
this
is
what
makes
your
definition
so...
i
don't
know...
manipulable.
you
could
look
on
it
as
the
fact
that
this
screen,
which
you
have
developed
in
such
a
fashion
that
you
can
push
one
side
of
the
screen
and
it
will
activate,
it
will
send
a
signal,
that
that
equipment
is...
is
itself
equipment
which
has
these
other
functions
on
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
excuse
me.
that's
assuming
that
what
congress
means
by
competition
is
just
having
competing
salesmen
for
the
same
network.
justice
antonin
scalia
do
you
think
that's
what...
do
you
think
that's
what
congress
meant
by...
by
competition?
we're
going
to
have...
just
one
single
network,
but
we're
going
to
have
competing
salesmen.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
producers--
justice
antonin
scalia
--right,
exactly.
