justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
general
waxman,
may
i...
do
i
have
it
right,
that
the
validity
of
telric
would
be...
if
you
prevail
on
the
jurisdictional
question,
that's
open.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that
hasn't
been
considered
yet.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
ennis,
one
of
the
briefs
said
that
most
of
the
sate
commissions
on
their
own
have
adopted
telric.
is
that
true?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
ms.
munns,
if
it's
a
federal
statute,
then
who
is
taking
care
to
see
that
the
federal
law
is
faithfully
executed?
i
thought
that
was
the
job
of
the
federal
executive.
and
i
don't
know,
frankly,
any
scheme
where
you
have
federal
law
governing,
federal
courts
doing
the
review,
but
no
article
ii
agency.
there's
no
federal
executive
presence
in
it.
so,
you
have
the
legislature.
the
legislation
is
federal.
the
enforcement
in
court
is
federal,
but
in
between
no
federal
executive
presence.
and
is
there
any
other...
in
all
of
federal
law,
is
there
any
other
such
scheme,
and
if
there
is,
how
does
it
measure
up
to
article
ii?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
louisiana
was
before
the
1996
act.
and
doesn't
the
1996
act
change
the
character
of
the...
there
was
once
a
clear
divide,
and
that's
why
these
1934
parts
that
weren't
changed
are
written
as
they
are.
but
now
the
1996
act
becomes
part
of
the
total
legislative
package.
and
so,
all
of
these
restrictions
that
were
appropriate
in
1934
have
to
be
adjusted
so
that
1996
legislation
can
fit.
isn't
that
so?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
about
(d)(1)?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
somewhat
different?
could
some
have
historical
costs
and
others
not?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
if
there's
a
limit...
i
mean,
only
the
word
cost.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
federal
judiciary
without
any
federal
executive
in
between.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
isn't
that
an
unusual
scheme?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
barr,
just
as
a
matter
of
information,
what
else
is
there
for
the
would
be
entrant
who
has
no
facilities
of
its
own?
what
other
source
would
there
be
to
obtain
network
elements?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
where
else
could
they
go?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
before
you
go
away
from
the
need
and
impair,
what
would
be
a
fair
way
of
implementing
that
statutory
provision?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
about
mr.
barr's
point
that
there
are
other
sources?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that
mr.
barr
said...
i
asked,
suppose
someone
has
no
facilities,
how
do
they
get
into
this,
apart
from
using
the
incumbent's
facilities?
and
mr.
barr
answered,
the
fcc
never
looked
around.
if
they
did,
they
would
see
that
there
were
other
places
where
the
new
entrants--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--people
won't
request
things
they
don't
need.
it's
essentially
as
though
that
requirement
weren't
there.
so,
it
doesn't
really
mean
anything
other
than
what
would
happen
if
it
weren't
there.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
just
before
you
do
that,
would
you...
would
you
explain
to
me
if
congress
really
meant
these
two
to
be
available
kind
of
at
the
entrant's
option,
why
was
there
conditioning
of
the
long
distance
carrier
on
the...
getting
into
the
resale
business
but
not
on
the
networks
element,
if
congress
thought
you
could
get
everything
by
the
networks
element
route?
