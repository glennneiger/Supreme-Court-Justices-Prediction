justice
david
h.
souter
but
i
take
it
it's
your
position
that
the
fcc
has
no...
has
no
discretion
about
reserving
the
adjudicatory
jurisdiction
to
the
states.
the
fcc
could
not
say
in
a
non
default
situation,
we're
going
to
make
all
the
rates
too.
the
fcc
has
no
authority
over
that
under...
under
your
argument,
does
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
would
it
do...
would
it
have
that
authority
at
the
front
end
as
well
as
at
the
back
end?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
what
do
you
think
of
252(c)(1),
which
general
waxman
alluded
to,
which
binds
the
adjudicators
in
those
circumstances
to
applying
the
regs
issued
under
251?
251(d)
does
not
make
any
textual
distinction
in...
in
the
regulation
granting
authority
between
regulations
over
rates
and...
and
other
subjects
that
the
commission
could
address.
therefore,
it
seems
to
say...
the
two
seem
to
say
combined...
that
the
state
adjudicatory
authorities
have
got
to
follow
commission
regs
even
when
those
commission
regs
refer
to...
to
rate,
i.e.,
ratemaking
methodology.
what's
your
answer
to
that?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
but
maybe
i'm
missing...
i
know
i'm
missing
the
point
because
i
thought
the
reference
back
to
251
and
regs
issued
under
251
was
a
reference,
in
effect,
to
the
rulemaking
authority
under
251(d).
and
i
don't
think
there's
any
textual
distinction
in
251(d)
between
regs
that
may
affect
the
ratemaking
methodology
and
regs
on
other
subjects.
so,
that's
why
i
thought
the
reference
in
252(c)(1)
would,
in
effect,
be
a
reference
back
to
commission
regulations
insofar
as
they
deal
with
ratemaking.
justice
david
h.
souter
so,
basically
your
answer
is
that
251(d)
refers
solely
to
timing.
what
about
the
reference
in
the
preceding...
whether
or
not
i
agree
with
that,
what
about
the
references
in
the
preceding
sections
with
respect
to...
interconnection,
unbundled
access,
and
so
on
that
themselves
refer
to
regulations?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
they
include
regulations
dealing
with
rates.
justice
david
h.
souter
this
morning
i
was
thinking
along
the
lines
that
you
just
stated,
and
i
was
tempted
to
criticize
the
fcc
for
not
getting
a
better
standard.
and
then
i
asked
myself
the
question,
how
well
could
i
have
done?
you
see?
and
i
think
it
is
a
defense
to
say,
well,
it
isn't
good
but
it's
the
best
we
could
do.
and
therefore,
i
would
like
to
ask
you
to
give
me
an
example
of
how
you
would
have
made
the
intuitive...
how
you
would
have
embodied
the
intuitive
distinction
you
mention
in
a
rule
that
would
be
better
than
this
one.
justice
david
h.
souter
we
don't...
we
don't
have
that
in
the...
it's
not
in
the
petitioners'
appendix.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
that's
not
what
it
says.
it
doesn't
say
what
you
have
just
said.
it
says,
such
term,
and
the
term
is
network
element
includes
da
da,
da
da,
da
da,
features
and
capabilities.
that's
not
what
you
said.
justice
david
h.
souter
so,
the
term
then
is
equipment.
okay.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
doesn't
he
have
a
textual
basis
for
his
claim
to
individualized
determinations?
in
the
language
in
(d)(2)(b),
which
refers
to
impairing
the
ability
of
the
telecommunications
carrier
seeking
access
to
provide
the
service,
that
sounds
like
an
individualized
determination.
justice
david
h.
souter
so
you
say.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
it
sounds
like
an
individualized
determination
is
contemplated,
and
i
think
that's
what
he's
asking.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
he
wants
that
determination
to
be
individualized
where
it
is
made.
justice
david
h.
souter
what
about
the
right
mind
point
that
mr.
carpenter
made?
he
said
nobody
in
his
right
mind
is
going
to
deal...
want
to
deal
with
you
if
he's
got
an
alternative.
what's
your
answer
to
that?
