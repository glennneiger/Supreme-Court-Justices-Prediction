mr.
david
w.
carpenter
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
mr.
barr
made
two
principal
arguments.
he
objects
to
the
fact
that
new
entrants
can
obtain
all
elements,
and
he
objects
to
the
application
of
the
need
standard.
the
implication
and
necessary
consequence
of
his
arguments,
if
accepted,
would
mean
that
there
would
be
no
price
constraints
whatsoever
on
the
incumbent
local
monopolies
in
any
area
of
the
country
until
some
local
facility
were
constructed
by
att
or
anyone
else
who
had
the
resources
to
do
so,
and
even
in
those
areas,
the
only
constraint
would
be
that
that
att
would
provide...
you
have
a
duopoly
rather
than
a
monopoly.
and
that
position
follows
from
the
fact
that
the
only
option
people
could
use
is
resale,
and
when
you
use
resale,
you
can
only
offer
one
of
the
two
services
that
any
local
exchange
network
offers.
you
could
only
offer
exchange
service
and
you
could
only
offer
it
on
terms
that
don't
affect
the
margins
that
the
local
monopolists
run
at
all.
so,
there's
no--
mr.
david
w.
carpenter
--pardon
me?
mr.
david
w.
carpenter
just
let's
put
this
in
context.
what
mr.
barr
wants
is
a
rule
of
the
fcc
that
means
that
when
these
states
conduct
arbitrations,
when
any
individual
requesting
carrier
asks
for
something,
you
litigate
whether,
for
that
requesting
carrier,
it
has
options.
there's
lots
of
people
who
concededly
under
even
his
view,
the
non
att's
of
this
world,
can't
build...
can't
construct
alternative
facilities.
so,
he
wants
to
tie
up
these...
these
arbitration
proceedings
with
case
by
case,
area
by
area
litigation
of
whether
particular
entrants
can
acquire
particular
facilities.
the
fcc
said
that
that
was
pointless.
when
it
was
applying
the
standards
of
252(d),
it
said
need
means
added
cost.
people...
it
found
people
won't
request
things
they
don't
need,
paragraph
287,
and
it
found
that
to
give
the
lec's
this...
yet
another
weapon
in
slowing
down
competition
would
delay
the...
delay
entry
and
increase
the
costs--
mr.
david
w.
carpenter
--the
fcc
considered
the
consequences
of
the
rule
that
mr.
barr
is
urging
and
it
found
it
would
serve
no
positive
purpose
because
people
won't
request
things
that
they
don't
need.
and
it
found
that
it
would
slow
down
entry
and--
mr.
david
w.
carpenter
--impose
added
costs.
mr.
david
w.
carpenter
absolutely,
your
honor.
but
the...
but
the...
but
the
fcc
doesn't
make
elements
available.
the
states
do.
the
fcc
adopts
regulations
that
define
the
conditions
under
which
states
must
make
them
available.
and
what
he's
complaining
about
is
that
those
regulations
didn't
allow
case
by
case
litigation
of
whether
particular
carriers--
mr.
david
w.
carpenter
--it's
a
statutory
question.
the
fcc
was
required
to
consider
that
in
promulgating
rules.
it
did
consider
that.
it
defined
need
as
added
cost,
and
no
one
disputes
that
that's
a
permissible
interpretation.
and
it...
it
found
that
carriers
who
didn't
need
things,
who
could
acquire
them
at
a
lower
cost
elsewhere,
wouldn't
ask
for
them,
and
that
his
rule
would
impose
added
litigation
costs
on
new
entrants
and
would
delay
entry.
mr.
david
w.
carpenter
no,
your
honor.
that's
the
standard
that
applies
to
the
fcc
when
it
adopts
rules
that
the
states
will
apply
when
they
perform
the
adjudicatory
function
of
determining
which
elements
are
to
be
made
available.
so,
it's...
that
is
a...
that
is
a
standard
that--
mr.
david
w.
carpenter
--and--
mr.
david
w.
carpenter
--well,
if...
i
would
submit
that
the
fcc
doesn't
make
anything
available.
only
the
states
do
that
in
arbitrations.
only
the
states
are
ever
going
to
make
individualized
determinations
under
the
structure
of
this
act.
mr.
david
w.
carpenter
that's
right,
and
the
fcc
determined
that...
that
it
would
defeat
the
objectives
of
the
act
and
would
impose
added
costs
on
people
for
no
reason
if
that
individualized
determination
were
required
to
be
made
in
each
separate
arbitration
proceeding.
and
it
rests
on...
on
a
finding
that
people
won't
ask
for
things
they
don't
need,
so
that
people
will
only
be
asking
for
things
that
they
do
need.
so,
it
satisfies
the...
the
standard
under
that
definition.
i
wonder,
if
i
might,
just
refer
to
the
other
major
point
here,
which
is
the...
the
fact
that
people
can
obtain
all
the
elements--
mr.
david
w.
carpenter
--yes,
and
that
relates
to
my
second
point.
the
point
is
that
when
you
obtain
elements,
even
if
you
obtain
all
the
elements,
you...
you
are...
you
are
investing
in
the
network
in
much
the
same
way
that
an
owner
would
be.
justice
breyer,
if
you
look
at
the
commission's
telric
rules,
paragraphs
686
to
687,
you
will
see
that
all
the
investment
risks
that
a
new
entrant...
you
know,
that
a
new
entrant
has
to...
has
to
take
on
all
the
investment
risks
of
the...
of
the
carrier
to
the
extent
the
new
entrant
is
leasing
the
carrier's
facilities.
so,
the
new
entrant
is
fundamentally
a
lessee
that
is
much
in
the
position
of
an
owner.
and
in
response
to
you,
justice
ginsburg,
when
the...
when
the
fcc
found
that
only
people
who
engaged
in
resale
under
(c)(4)
were
prohibited
from
jointly...
jointly
marketing
long
distance
services,
it
was
on
the
basis
that
it
only
covered
resale,
didn't
prohibit
owners
of
facilities,
and
that
lessees
of
network
elements
had
investments
like
those
of
owners,
not
like
those
of
resellers.
and
the
difference
between
resale
and...
and
leasing
network
elements
is
absolutely
fundamental.
when
you...
when
you're
a
reseller
under
(c)(4),
you're
just
buying
the
same
services
that
each
of
us
use
in
our
homes,
the
same
services.
when
you're...
it's...
local
telephone
networks
are
plants
that
provide
two
things:
exchange
services
we
each
buy,
exchange
access
services
that
inter
exchange
carriers
buy
and
that
account
for
35
percent
of
the
revenues.
when
you
resell...
when
you
resell,
you
only
get
to
resell
what
we
use
in
our
homes.
when
you
lease
elements,
you're
paying
for
the
whole...
whole
ball
of
wax,
everything
that's
there,
covering
all
the
investment
risks,
and
you're
in
a
position
to
provide
all
the
services
that
the
lec
is
currently
providing
and
impose
price
constraints
that
otherwise
won't
exist.
and
this
will
have
no
effect
on
the
incentives
of
people
to
build
new
facilities
because
even
if
you
lease
all
these
things
at
precisely
their
economic
cost,
you're
going
to
have
higher
costs
than
they
do
because
of
the
enormous
transaction
costs
of...
of
depending
on
a
monopoly
competitor
to
try
to
get
what
you
need
to
compete.
the
fcc
found
throughout
this
order
that
they
have
incentives
to
slow
roll
us
in
negotiation.
they
have
the
incentive
and
ability
to
discriminate
against
us.
we...
no
one
in
their
right
mind
would
rely
on
these
people
for...
for
facilities
if
they
could
obtain...
could...
could
obtain
them
from
another
source
themselves
at
anything
remotely
approaching
the
sum
of
the
costs
if
you
lease
all
the
elements.
so...
so,
this
is
as
fundamental
difference
as
one
can
imagine.
now,
mr....
mr.
barr
talks
about
the
specific
definition
of
operator
support
systems.
i
think
the
text
of
the
first
sentence
forecloses
this.
the
text
of
the
second
sentence
establishes
that
the...
this
is
not
something
that's
limited
to
routing
and
transmission.
but
i
just
want
to
point
out
that
a
separate
regulation
that
no
one
has
ever
challenged...
313(d)
i
think
it
is...
independently
requires
the
same
access
to
operations
for
systems
based
on
a
finding
that
if
you
don't
have
the
information
that
those
systems
provide,
you're
in
a
position
where
you
never
can
get
access
to
the
six
other
elements
that
are
not
being
challenged.
he
also
complains
about
the
fact
that
the...
this
rule
supposedly
give
access
to
live
operators.
they
don't.
the
specific
regulation
says
the
access
to
operator
facilities
and
all
the
functions
they
provide.
we
get
the
access
to
those
functions
irrespective
of
whether
those
functions
are
performed
by
humans
or
by
machines,
as
most
operator
functions
are,
by
the
way.
and
every
single
element
in
this
network
to
some
extent
relies
on
humans.
thank
you.
