we'll
hear
argument
now
in
a
number
of
consolidated
cases,
97-826,
at&t
corporation
v.
iowa
utilities
board,
et
cetera,
et
cetera.
[laughter]
and
we'll
have
an
hour
for
the
jurisdictional
argument.
then
we'll
take
a
very
brief
pause
while
counsel
adjust
their
seatings
at
the
table,
and
then
we'll
go
on
for
the
next
hour
of
argument.
general
waxman.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but,
general
waxman,
201(b)...
you
find
before
that,
of
course,
naturally
201(a),
and
there
it
says,
it
shall
be
the
duty
of
every
common
carrier
engaged
in
interstate
or
foreign
communication
by
wire
or
radio.
so,
don't
you
think
the
rule...
the
rulemaking
provision
is
limited
to
that
kind
of
things?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
you
think
its
plain
meaning
means
it
should
extend
beyond
the
section
in
which
it's
found?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes,
but--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--but,
you
know,
if
this
were
a
general
thing
that
were
to
extend
throughout
the
federal
communications
statutes,
why
would
you
find
it
tucked
away
here
at
the
very
end
of
section
201(b)?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
doesn't
that
suggest
that
each
of
those
grants
is
limited
to
the
sections
in
which
they're
found?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but...
but
if
shall
not
be
deemed
to
impair
201,
201
contains
(a)
as
well
as
(b).
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
it
could
be
read
as
a
limitation
on
(b).
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
are
those
decisions
of
this
court?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
by
courts
of
appeals?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes,
you
may,
general
waxman.
mr.
ennis,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief

general
waxman,
your
time
has
expired.
now
we'll
take
a
very
momentary
respite
from
sections
251
and
252
while

change
their

mr.
barr.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
barr,
what
again
is
what
you
say
is
the
error
that
they
have
not
appealed?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
section
are
you
talking
about?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
where
again
are
we
talking
about,
mr.--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
barr,
you
say
the
fcc
says
it
means
one
thing.
you
say
it
means
something
else.
you
have
to
show
that
what
they're
saying
is
wrong,
don't
you?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
is

rehnquist
--mr.
waxman,
you
can't
put
questioners
on
hold.
chief

william
h.
rehnquist
when
your
red
light
goes

it
goes

chief

rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
waxman.
mr.
carpenter,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
if--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--if
congress
provided
that
need
is
the
standard,
the
fcc
has
got
to
defer
to
that.
it
can't
just
say
congress
made
a
mistake.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
he's
complaining
about
is
the...
is
the
transition
from
need
to
want,
which
is
a
statutory
question.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.

mr.

minutes

you,
mr.

case
is
submitted.
