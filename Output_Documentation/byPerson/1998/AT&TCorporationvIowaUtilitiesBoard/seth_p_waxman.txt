mr.
seth
p.
waxman
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
1996,
congress
enacted
general
standards
designed
to
bring
competition
to
local
telecommunications
markets
rapidly
and
throughout
the
country.
in
doing
so,
it
expressly
extended
federal
law
to
cover
the
rates,
terms,
and
conditions
under
which
incumbents
must
provide
new
entrants
access
to
their
facilities.
no
one
doubts
that
the
fcc
has
authority
to
promulgate
some
rules
interpreting
these
provisions.
the
jurisdictional
issue
presented
in
this
case
is
whether
in
certain
specific
respects,
principally
regarding
the
methodology
for
setting
lease
rates
for
network
elements,
congress
has
for
the
first
time
denied
the
fcc
rulemaking
authority
with
respect
to
a
substantive
provision
of
the
communications
act.
the
answer
is
no.
the
1996
amendments
preserved
the
commission's
existing
authority
under
section
201(b)
to
prescribe
such
rules
and
regulations
as
may
be
necessary
in
the
public
interest
to
carry
out
the
provisions
of
this
act.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
no,
i
don't,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
for
a
variety
of
reasons.
first
of
all,
section
201(b),
in
which
the
relevant
rulemaking
grant
is
not
so
limited...
and
we
think
that
in
any
event,
the
specific
sentence
in
201(b)
that
i
quoted
should
be
interpreted
according
to
its
plain
meaning.
moreover,
in
the--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--i
think
that
it
means...
section
201(a)
is...
itself
is
limited
to
intrastate
and
foreign
commerce.
the
last
sentence
of
section
201(b)
is
not
so
limited.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
and
i
think
it
should
be
interpreted
according
to
its
terms.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
well,
mr.
chief
justice,
two
responses.
first
of
all,
in...
in
i
think
what
can
only
be
described
as
belt
and
suspenders,
the
commission
has
other
statutory
provisions
that
granted
the
same
plenary
rulemaking
authority,
47
u.s.c.,
section
154(i)
and
section
303(r).
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
i
don't
think
it
does,
and
moreover,
with
respect
to
201(b),
it's
clear
that
congress
in
1996
had
this
section
specifically
in
mind
because
section
251(i)
of
the
1996
amendments,
which
is
entitled
savings
provision,
specifically
says
that
nothing
in
this
act
shall
be
deemed
to
limit...
nothing
in
section
251
shall
be
deemed
to
limit
or
impair
the
applicability
of
the
provisions
of
section
201.
so,
we
think
it...
congress
had
it
in
mind
and
wanted
it
to
be
interpreted
according
to
its
plain
meaning,
but--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--that's
true.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
i
do
think,
with
respect,
mr.
chief
justice,
first
of
all,
that
that
would
require
you
to
read
the
sentence,
the
rulemaking
provision
in
201(b),
not
in
accordance
with
its
plain
meaning.
and
secondly,
the
1996
act
itself,
in
any
event,
in
section
251(d)(1)
mandated
the
fcc
within
6
months
to
promulgate
rules,
quote,
as
necessary
to
implement
the
requirements
of
this
section,
and
that
section
requires
incumbents
to
provide
access
to
network
elements
at
rates
that
are
just,
reasonable,
and
in
accordance
with
the
terms
of
section
252.
the
fact
that
section
252
itself
directs
state
commissions
in
arbitration
proceedings
to
set
the
specific
rates
charged
by
a
particular
carrier
in
a
particular
market
for
a
particular
element
is
completely
consistent
with
the
fcc's
authority
to
prescribe
the
general
methodology
by
which
those
rates
should
be
set.
in
fact--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--well--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--it...
my
case
would--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--my
case
wouldn't
founder
at
all
for
three
reasons.
first
of
all,
section
154(i)
of
the
act
provides
in
a
general
provision
that's
not
limited
to
radio
or
cable
or
anything
else,
similarly
provides
the
commission
with
broad
rulemaking
authority
to
implement
for
any
provisions
of
the
act.
second
of
all,
section
251(d)
is
an
express
jurisdictional
mandate
to
promulgate
rules
implementing
the
provisions
of
251
which
includes
the
requirements
that
rates
be
reasonable
and
in
accordance
with
section
252.
and
finally,
if
your
question
is
directed
at
the
operation,
i
guess,
of
section
2(b)
of
the
act,
we
think
that
section
2(b)
of
the
act,
which
is
a
rule
of
construction,
is
inapplicable
to
this
case
because
sections
251
and
252
apply
federal
law
to
facilities
that
are
used
interchangeably
for
both
interstate
and
intrastate
calls.
just
like
the
telephone
handset
that
we
use
every
day,
the
local
telephone
network
is
neither
an
intrastate
or
an
interstate
facility.
it's
both.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
no,
it
doesn't
prove
too
much
because
before
the
1996
act...
well,
first
of
all,
before
the
1996
act,
the
fcc
did
regulate
how
local
incumbents
charge
other
carriers
for
use
of
their
network,
for
example,
in
the
cases
involving
exchange
access
or
private
lines
or
customer
provided
equipment.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
no,
with
respect
to
both.
all
of
the
court
of
appeals'
rulings
upholding
the
jurisdiction
of
the
fcc
with
respect
to
private
lines
and
customer
premises
equipment
were
premised
on
the
fact
that
these
are
used
inextricably
for
both.
and
since
the
fcc
clearly
has
rulemaking
authority
with
respect
to
the
interstate
component,
under
footnote
4
of
this
court's
decision
in
louisiana
public
service
commission,
they
had
authority
to
regulate
the
use
of
all
of
the
uses,
interstate
and
intrastate,
of
those
elements
because
they
could
not
be,
quote,
separated.
and,
moreover,
the
section
2(b)
does
not
apply
to
this
case
for
two
independent
reasons.
first,
because
no
construction
of
any
provision
of
the
law
is
required.
the
local
competition
provision,
sections
251
and
252
indisputably
apply
to
intrastate
matters,
and
sections
201(b)
and
2--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--well,
i
don't
think--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--i...
no,
i
think
the
import
of
section
2(b),
as
this
court
announced
in
louisiana
public
service
commission,
is
that
an...
a
provision
of
the
communications
act
won't
be
understood
to
apply
to
a
purely
interstate
matter
unless
it
clearly
does.
it's
not
a
rule
that
says
disregard
what
everybody
agrees
the
act
does.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
oh,
i
don't
think
so
at
all.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
well,
i
think
it
is
not
possible
to
apply
any
provisions
of
the...
or
certainly
the
provisions
that
we're
dealing
with
here,
251,
252,
253,
254,
271,
as
dealing
inextricably
with
interstate
and
intrastate
matters.
but
the...
there
is
nothing
in
the
act,
for
example,
that
would
permit
the
fcc
to
impose
or
to
take
away
the
state
commissions'
authority
to
set
maximum
retail
rates
for...
for
customers.
and,
in
fact,
if
congress
had
repealed
section
2(b)
or
made
section
2(b)
inapplicable
to
these
sections...
i
don't
know
whether
it
would
have,
but
the
fcc
could
have
said,
well,
we've
now
got
ancillary
jurisdiction
to
take
over
the
state's
retail
ratemaking
function.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
well,
we
think
that
it
is,
in
fact,
impossible
to
apply
it
to
the
local
competition
provisions
in
this
case,
first,
because
those
provisions
plainly
do
apply
to
interstate
matters,
and
the
fcc
has
statutory
authority
to
implement
them.
and
second...
and
this
is
a
fundamental,
independent
point...
even
if
2(b)
applied
under
the
rule
expressed
in
footnote
4
of
louisiana
public
service
commission,
because
there
is
also
no
doubt
that
251
and
252
also
apply
inextricably
to
interstate
matters
over
which
the
commission
has
unquestioned
jurisdiction.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
no.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
no.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
well,
what
it--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--i
think,
justice
kennedy,
rather
than
say
change
the
definition,
the
definitions
were
already
becoming
quite
blurred,
as
i've
indicated,
by
the
decisions
involving
private
lines
and
private
branch
exchanges
and
exchange
access.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
they're
all
decisions
of
the
fcc
that
were...
that
were
approved
on
appeal
without...
without
exception
by
the
courts
of
appeals.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
and
some
of
those
decisions,
mr.
chief
justice,
are
referred
to
or
referenced
in
footnote
4
of
this
court's
opinion
in
louisiana
public
service
commission.
what
the...
justice
kennedy,
what
the
act
did,
if
you
look
at
sections
251
and
252,
it
doesn't
even
use
the
words
interstate
or
intrastate
because
congress
recognized
that
the
use
of
network
elements
is...
is
inextricably
entwined
with
both,
and
what
it--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--we
think
that
it
is
not
applicable
with
respect
to
these
provisions,
and
to
the
extent
that
it
did
apply,
the
exception
for
inseverability
would
nonetheless
give
the
fcc
the
authority
to
promulgate
rules
about
this
methodology.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
right.
there's--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--there's
nothing--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--because
there
is
nothing
irreconcilable
about...
about
section
252(b),
(c),
and
(d)
and
the
requirement
you
pointed
out
in
section
251(c)(3)
that
rates
be
just,
reasonable,
and
in
accordance
with
section
252.
251(c)
incorporates
expressly
the
right...
the
requirements
and
the
standards
of
252(d),
and
in
252...
252(b)
gives
the
state
commissions
jurisdiction
and
the
mandate
to
resolve
open
issues
in
arbitration
between
carriers.
and
it
tells
them
in
(c)
that
in
resolving
any
open
issue,
which
surely
includes
open
issues
about
rates,
that
they
must...
that
they
must
resolve
any
open
issue
and
ensure
that
such
resolution
and
conditions
meet
the
requirements
of
section
251,
including
the
regulations
prescribed
by
the
commission
pursuant
to
section
251.
now--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--now,
if
you
were
to...
a
reading
that
says
that
the
references
to
what
state
commissions
do
in
arbitration
ousts
the
federal...
federal
communications
commission
with
respect
to
any
matter...
any
reference
to
or
any
responsibility
with
respect
to
carrier
to
carrier
rates,
you
are
required
to...
you...
you
encounter
a
half
dozen
or
more
irreconcilable
interpretive
anomalies
elsewhere
in
the
statute.
and
i'll
point
you
just
to
the
most
significant
one.
this
act
has
two
principal
provisions.
provision
number
one,
which
is
reflected
in
251,
means
that
the
local
incumbents
have
got
to
give
new
entrants
access
to
their
markets
for
local
competition.
and
section
271
is
the
provision
that
lets
the
local
incumbents,
once
they
have
satisfied
certain
conditions
to
the
fcc's
satisfaction,
to
enter
into
competition
in
the
long
distance
markets
from
their
home
regions.
we
have
a
cert
petition
pending
with
respect
to
another
decision
of
the
eighth
circuit
interpreting
271.
but
the
point
is
this.
section
271...
under
section
271(d),
the
fcc
must
determine
on
its
own...
it
must
find
on
its
own
and
without
deference
to
state
commissions,
but
after
giving,
quote,
substantial
weight
to
the
views
of
the
attorney
general,
that
the
bell
operating
companies
have
satisfied
the
terms
of
section
251
and
252,
including
the
pricing
terms.
and
if
section
251
is
given
its
plain
meaning,
we
must
be
right
about
the
commission's
ability
to
issue
general,
methodological
rules
on
ratemaking
under
251--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--and
252.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
okay.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
well--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--justice--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--justice
breyer,
what...
this
act
does
not
take
away
the
state
commissions'
historical
ratemaking
role.
historically
they
made
rate...
they
determined
retail
rates
and
they
still
do
that.
what
this
act
has
done--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--the
role
that
the
state
commissions
have
always
had
is
to
determine
the
maximum
rates
that
the
telephone
company
can
charge
retail
and
wholesale
customers,
and
they
still
have
that.
what
the
act
does
was
create
something
new,
that
is,
the
ability
to
set
rates
between
competitors,
carrier
to
carrier
rates,
for
elements,
and
it...
and
the
act
makes
that
a
federal
standard,
but
doesn't
reserve
all
the
responsibilities
to
the
fcc.
it
gives
the
fcc
rulemaking
authority
and
gives
the
state
commissions
the
authority
to
apply
those
rules
and
determine
those
standards.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
that's--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--that's
right.
and
telric...
it's
not
fair
to
say
that
there's
a
thousand
pages
applying
rules.
telric
is
contained
in
a
specific,
discrete
regulation.
the
commission
was
required
to
deal
with
tens
of
thousands
of
pages
of
comments,
and
it
did
so.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
but
there
are
explanations
of
this
carrier
wanted
this,
this
commenter
wanted
that.
the
specific
rules
can
be
succinctly
stated.
may
i
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time,
please?
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
every
question
that
has
been
raised
in
this
oral
argument
can
be
answered
with
reference
to
section
251(c)(3)
which
requires...
that
deals
with
unbundled
network
elements
and
requires
that
they
provided...
be
provided
at
rates,
terms,
and
conditions
that
are
just,
reasonable,
and...
and
consistent
with
the
standards
of
section
252.
four
of
the
five
issues
we're
going
to
be
talking
about
in
the
next
hour
deal
with
that.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
because
congress
has
authorized
the
fcc
to
promulgate
rules
implementing
the
communications
act,
those
rules
must
be
given
effect
unless
they
are
arbitrary,
capricious,
unreasonable,
or
manifestly
contrary
to
the
statute.
there
are
five
substantive
rules
that
are
at
issue
in
this
portion
of
the
case,
and
each
one
is
fully
consistent
with
the
text
of
the
act.
the
incumbents
object
to
those
rules
based
on
their
predictions
about
how
competition
will
proceed
if
the
rules
were
permitted
to
go
into
effect.
but
each
of
those
objections
was
considered
by
the
commission
within
the
mandatory
6-month
period
and
in
an
atmosphere
in
which
there
was
no
competition
to
speak
of
in
any
market,
and
the
commission,
after
hearing
thousands
and
tens
of
thousands
of
pages
of
comments,
resolved
those
policy
objections
on
the
record
in
a
manner
that
promotes
the
paramount
objective
of
the
1996
amendments
to
produce
vigorous
competition
in
this
country's
monopoly
local
telephone
markets
as
rapidly
as
possible
by
giving
potential
new
entrants
a
range
of
competitive
options.
take,
for
example,
the
two
issues
that,
at
least
before
this
morning,
appeared
to
be
at
the
center
of
the
case.
they
certainly
were
at
the
center
of
the
briefs
of
the
case.
first,
this
is
rule
315(b).
applying
the
nondiscrimination
requirement
of
section
251(c)(3)
that
we
talked
about,
the
fcc
promulgated
a
rule
that
prohibits
incumbents
from
imposing
completely
gratuitous
costs
on
new
entrants
by
ripping
apart
network
elements
that
are
already
combined
in
the
incumbent's
system.
second,
the
commission
declined
to
legislate
a
requirement
nowhere
present
in
the
language
of
the
statute
that
new
entrants
build
one
or
more
network
elements
before
invoking
the
right
to
these
others.
the
incumbents,
but
notably
in
this
regard
not
the
state
commissions,
argue
that
these
rules,
taken
together,
will
undermine
the
current
system
of
implicit
universal
service
subsidies.
that
is
correct.
in
section
254
of
the
act,
congress
mandated
an
end
to
this
monopoly
based
system
to
be
replaced
by
a
new
system
of
explicit
charges,
applied
equally
among
all
carriers,
regardless
of
the
means
by
which
they
compete.
the
fcc
is
implementing
its
part
of
the
reform,
and
it
has
found
on
the
record
that
the
state
commissions
will
do
as
well,
as
soon
as
cost
based
competition
is
introduced
into
their
local
markets.
the
incumbents
argue
that
these
rules
would,
quote,
eviscerate
resale
as
a
competitive
option.
but
the
commission
found
that
they
would
not
and
it
explained
why
in
its
order
and
its
predictive
judgments
are
entitled
to
deference.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
let
me
try
and
address
it
if
i
understand
what
the...
i
understand
the
question
to
be
why
isn't
there
fear
that
new
incumbents
will
use
the
opportunity
to
lease
all
elements
to,
in
effect,
make
an
end
run
around
the
resale
option
that
the
statute
permits
under
(c)(4)
which
is
priced
as
a
discount
to
retail
rates.
is
that--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--i
will...
okay,
i
will
take
a
try,
and
to
the
extent
to
which
there
is
some
part
of
your
question
i
haven't
answered,
please
give
me
the
chance.
the
assertion
that
allowing
new
entrants
to
lease
all
network
elements
would
obliterate
resale
as
a
competitive
option
is
both
empirically
wrong,
as
the
commission
found
on
the
record...
and
i
will
point
you
to
the
provisions...
but
it
is
also...
and
before
i
get
to
it,
i
think
it
fundamentally
misconceives
the
statute.
there
is
no
textual
basis
in
the
statute
for
preferring
one
mode
of
competition
or
the
other.
the
fcc
found...
and
i
think
it's
correct
in
this
regard...
that
congress,
in
passing
this
statute,
in
effect,
acted
in
the
role
of
aristotle's
prime
mover.
it
set...
it
created
a
set
of
options
for
private
choice
to
ensure
that
something
would
work
to
bring
competition
in
each
disparate
local
market
whether
it's
rural
residential
or
downtown
manhattan,
and
like
natural
selection,
what
matters
is
not
that
every
variation
survives
for
every
possible
competitive
strategy,
but
that
at
least
one
works
in
each
environment.
so,
i
disagree
with
the...
and
the
fcc
disagreed
with
the
premise
of
their
understanding
of
the
act.
now,
creating
a
rule--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--well,
that...
that
is
the
problem
for--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--no.
congress
wanted
facilities...
new
entrants
to
build
facilities.
and
the
fcc
has
embraced
that.
we're
now
talking
about
the
means
to
get
there.
what
your
comment
suggests
is
the
reason
why
resale,
using
the
(c)(4)
option,
will
not...
can't
produce
this...
construction
of
new
facilities
and
doesn't
even
produce
real
price
competition
because
the
resalers--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--are
just
getting
a
discount.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
now,
with
respect
to
the
empirical
findings
that
the
commission
made...
and
recall,
justice
breyer,
that
these
were
findings
that
had
to
be
made
within
6
months
by
mandate
in
a
period
in
which
there
is
no
competition.
someone's
predictive
judgment
is
going
to
have
to
be
given
weight,
either
the
fcc's,
which
for
65
years
has
been
regulating
this
industry,
or
local...
or
local
incumbents
who
have
never
experienced
and
certainly
have
not
embraced
cost
based
competition.
what
the
fcc
found...
and
i
would
direct
you
to
paragraphs
331
through
334
of
the
first
report
and
order
principally,
although
there
are
some
other
subsidiary
references...
is
as
follows.
first,
that
resale
allows
quicker
entry
because
you
don't
have
to
go
through
this
detailed,
bottoms
up
costing
determination.
it
provides,
unlike
leasing
network
elements,
a
guaranteed
return.
you
know
what
you
are
going
to
be
making
when
you
resell
and
you
know
what
your
costs
will
be.
it
also
is
better,
justice
breyer,
for
an
entrant
that
only
wants
to
offer
a
narrow
range
of
services
or
an
entrant
that
has
little
up
front
capital.
i
mean,
this
act
was
not
enacted
to
protect
at&t
or
bell
atlantic
or
any
other
giant
that
may
be
able
to
compete
on
its
own
terms.
the
purpose
of
this
act
was
to
allow
vigorous
competition
even
by
little
guys
a
la
what
happened
when
long
distance
services
were
deregulated
because
at&t
at
the
time
had
to
give
access
to
its
elements
at
the
best
rate
it
offered
to
anybody.
and
moreover,
even
in
the
short
term
period
before
state
universal
service
is
reformed
from
a
monopoly
implicit
subsidy
situation
to
what
congress
has
mandated,
explicit
subsidies
that
apply
to
and
are
charged
against
all
entrants,
even
entrants
that
are
competing
on
the
basis
of
network
elements,
during
that
period
rural
customers
can
only
receive
competition
through
resale.
and
in
general,
residential
customers
who
don't
make
long
distance
calls
will
be
serviced
through
the
(c)(4)
mechanism.
the
commission
also
found...
i
think
it's
paragraph
334...
that
just
as
resale
has
certain
advantages
and
disadvantages
with
respect
to
leasing
elements,
leasing
elements
has
greater
risks
and
operational
costs
for
all
potential
competitors.
first
of
all,
there
are
fixed
costs.
some
network
elements,
like
the
loop,
like
the
network
interface
device,
like
certain
sub
elements
within
the
switch,
are
leased
on
a
flat
rate
per
month
basis,
and
those
costs
have
to
be
paid
whether
you
get
enough
revenues
from
the
customer
or
not.
and
in
many
instances...
and
they're
documented
i
think
in
at&t's
reply
brief...
the...
the
fixed
costs
for
leasing
the
loop
alone,
which
is
only
one
of
the
seven
elements,
is
greater
than
the
retail
charge
that
the
incumbent
is
making
for
that
service.
in
addition,
telric
and
other
pricing
mechanisms
allow
incumbents
to
charge...
make
nonrecurring
charges
like
one
time
provisioning
and
installation
charges.
that's
money
that
you
pay
on
the
barrel
head
whether
you
want
to
get
out
quickly
or
not
and
whether
your
customer
ends
up
generating
enough
revenue
to
satisfy
you
or
not.
even
as
to
usage
sensitive
rates,
there
are
risks.
you
can
say,
well,
you
know,
you
only
pay
for
so
much
of
the
switch
as
you
use.
that's
true,
but
you
have
to
be
able
to
collect
it
from
your
customer,
and
if
you
have
a
customer,
for
example,
who
doesn't
make
any
long
distance
calls,
all
he
does
is
call
his
internet
service
provider
and
he
spends
5
hours
a
day
surfing
the
web,
you
will
end
up
having
to...
if
you
resell,
you
don't
have
any
risks,
but
if
you
lease
the
switch
as
a
network
element,
you
will
have
very
significant
usage
costs
and
yet
will
only
be
able
to--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--well,
exactly
right.
exactly
right.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
well,
let
me
make
two
points,
justice
breyer.
i
don't
want
to
dwell
on
this
point
for
all
of
my
time.
the
fcc
again
was
promulgate...
it
had
6
months
to...
to
essentially
review
all
of
this
record.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
the
fcc
has
said
at
many
times
during
this
order
there's
no
competition
now
and
we
don't
have
a
crystal
ball
about
the
way
it's
going
to
compete,
but
we
have
to
make
a
predictive
judgment.
and
if
competition
develops
in
a
way
that
our
rules
don't
accommodate,
we
will
change
them.
they
say
that
over
and
over
again
with
respect
to
the
need
and
impair
standard--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--absolutely.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
okay.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
let
me
give
you
an
answer
that
looks
to
the
two
paradigms
you've
just
addressed.
with
respect
to
rural
residential
customers,
the
paradigmatic
customers
that
under
old
universal
service
are
getting
service
below
cost--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--okay.
i
just...
i
just--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--okay.
with...
let
me...
let
me
focus--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--well,
i...
let
me
just
say
that
any
time,
if
there
is
a
subsidized
customer
under
the
old
system,
that
a
new
incumbent
takes
over
on
the
basis
of
resale,
the
local
incumbent
isn't
hurt
at
all.
it
gets
the
same
costs
and
the
same
revenues
it
always
would
have
gotten.
it's
not
hurt
by
having
a
new
entrant
take
that
subsidized
customer
away.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
no,
no,
no.
it--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--okay.
let's
look
at
the
business
customer,
what
they
refer
to
as
the
cream
skimming
mode,
that
if
these
commission
rules
are
allowed
to
come
into
effect,
the
barbarians
at
the
gate
will
come
rushing
in
and...
and
take
away
instantly
all
of
their
business
customers,
thus
depriving
them
of
what
they
need
to
provide
universal
service.
first,
again
i
think
we
have
to
refer
to
what
the
commission
considered
and
what
the
commission
decided,
and
unfortunately
to
do
that,
you
need
to
look
not
only
at
the
first
report
and
order
in
this
case,
but
the
commission's
report
and
order
with
respect
to
access
charge
reform
that
is...
was
affirmed
in
the
eighth
circuit
decision
we
lodged
with
the
court,
and
the
commission's
findings
in
its
universal
service
reform
order,
which
is
on
appeal
now
to
the
fifth
circuit.
the...
the...
i
think
it's
important
to
say
here
a
few
things.
one,
the
state...
it's
very
significant
that
the
state
commissions,
who
have,
after
all,
with
the
fcc
the
real
interest
in
protecting
universal
service,
have
not
challenged
any
of
these
unbundling
rules.
second
of
all,
the
fcc
made
a
finding.
it
made
an
empirical
finding
that
the
pace
of
cost
based
competition
has
not
and
is
not
likely
to
outstrip
the
incumbents'
ability
to
bear
it.
and
it
has
found
on
the
record
that
if
that
happens,
the
fcc
like
the
states
can
take
interim
measures
to
protect
the
incumbents
and
to
protect
universal
service.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
no,
but
could
i
ask
your
indulgence
and
just
finish
this
answer--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--and
then
address--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--i
just
want
to
make
sure
i...
i
answer
you
fully.
if
you
look
at...
in
our
reply
brief,
for
example,
at
pages
31
and
32,
notes
21
and
22,
you'll
see
some,
but
not
all
of
the
findings
that
the
commission
made.
and
in
fact,
the
commission
has
already
taken
steps
to
provide
interim
relief
to
make
sure--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--okay.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
justice
kennedy,
with
respect
to
the...
the...
the
question...
the
point
that...
i
do
apologize.
i
didn't
realize
i
was
that
much
out
of
time.
with
respect
to
the
question
that
they've
raised
with
respect
to
the
commission's
interpretation
of
251(d)(2),
251(d)(2)
says
nothing
about
state
commissions.
it
says
that
in...
i'm
quoting
from
the
statute
here.
in
determining
what
network
elements
should
be
made
available
for
purposes
of
subsection
(c)(3),
the
commission
shall
consider
need
and
impairment.
now,
there
is
no
question
in
this
case
that
the
commission
applied
dictionary
definitions
for
those
words,
and
there
is
no
question
in
the
first
report
and
order
that
it
considered
both
need
and
impair
not
only
in
general
in
the
section
that
addresses
this
standard,
but
as
to
each
of
the
seven
network
elements
that
it
identified,
loops,
switches,
trunks,
nid's,
signaling.
it
has
a
section
with
respect
to
each
one
that
applies
the
need
and
impairment
standard
and
states
the
reasons
why
it
thinks
that
it
was
met.
again,
this
is
an
order
that
was
required
to
be
produced
within
6
months,
a
time
when
there
was
no
competition,
a
time
in
which
all
of
the
incumbents
are
monopolists
and
the
commission
determined,
again
making
specific
references
to
the
fact
that
it
may
change
its
requirements
as
conditions
develop...
it
expressly
said
for
present
purposes
in
this
environment
where
there's
no
competition,
we're
only
going
to
look
within
the
incumbent
monopolist's
own
network.
and
that
is
a
reasonable
requirement
in
a
monopoly
regime.
