justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
what
about
using
2(b)
in
what
i
think
is
a
rather
difficult
statutory
problem,
which
is
to
reconcile...
assuming
there
is
rulemaking
authority,
reconcile
the
word
rates,
you
know,
in
251
where
it
talks
about
unbundled
access.
it
says
there's
a
duty
to
provide
unbundled
access,
you
know,
at
rates
that
are
just
and
reasonable.
and
then
when
you
get
over
to
252,
it
says
that
state
commissions
will
establish
rates,
and
they
have
to
be
just
and
reasonable.
now,
why
wouldn't
2(b)
come
in
right
there,
trying
to
interpret
and
reconcile
those
two
words?
rates
in
both--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--reconciling
them
by
saying--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--look
at
history
and
look
at
the
extent
to
which
a
rate
is
traditionally
up
to
the
carrier
for
state
regulation,
look
at
it
traditionally
federal
regulation,
and
say
that's
what
we
look
to,
and
that's
what
the
difference
between
the
rates
in
the
two
sections
means.
why
wouldn't
we
use
2(b)
as
a
guide
there?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
general,
methodological
rules,
yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
not
rules
that
take
75
years
of
ratemaking
and
turn
them
on
their
heads--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--preventing
commissions,
state
commissions,
in
effect,
should
they
so
wish,
to
permit
a
local
monopolist
to
recover
his
fixed
costs.
for
example,
someone
who
follows
these
rules
sees
in
them
1,000
pages
of
detail,
and
therefore,
using
2(b)
one
would
say
the
commission
would
lack
the
power
to
write
rules
with
1,000
pages
of
detail
such
that
they,
in
effect,
become
a
system
called
telric,
the
like
of
which
has
not
been
known
previously.
and
it
seems
inconsistent
with
state
regulation.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now,
i'm
trying
to
summarize
their
argument
in
like
one
sentence,
but
that's
what
i've
tried
to
do.
[laughter]
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that
part
was
what
i
didn't
get
because
i
read
through
these
over
the
summer,
and
i
don't
see
how
the
state
maintains
a
significant
rate
setting
role.
and
i
don't
know
that...
that
was
what
was
bothering
me.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you're
right.
i
think
i
overstated
that.
but
i
think
several
hundred
is
fair.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
how
do
i
vote?
this
is...
this
is
what's
actually
bothering
me.
how
would
i
decide
this
case
if
i
thought,
well,
yes...
and
i'm...
just
for
the
sake
of
argument,
assume
yes,
i
accept
that
the
fcc
has
the
power
to
set
some
rules
in
respect
to
rates.
but
suppose
i'm
worried
about
this
particular
set
of
rules
and
really
not
because
of
their
detail,
but
rather
because
of
their
content,
which
is
a
system
that
the
state
might
be
free
to
adopt
on
its
own.
but
it
seems
by
telling
the
state
what
system
to
adopt
to
over...
to
go
too
deeply
into
the
matters
that
2(b)
seemed,
historically
speaking,
to
reserve
to
states...
suppose
i
thought
that.
how
should
i
decide
this
case?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
no.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why
what
it
means?
what
justice
ginsburg
said
was
about
the
limits
on
what
it
means.
i
take
it
you're
saying
that
a
state
commission
would
have
considerable
leeway
to
decide
whether
to
determine
costs
on
the
basis
of
a
price
cap,
on
the
basis--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--of
some
kind
of
historical
rate
base
like,
despite
that
parenthetical
which
is
there
for
no
purpose--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--is
there
for
another
purpose.
all
right,
but
there
are
ways,
or
future
oriented.
but
there
might
still
be
limits
on
what
it
can
do.
fine.
those
limits
would
be
determined
by
a
federal
judge
in
your
view.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
in
section
6
of
duties,
it
imposes
a
duty
upon
a
carrier
to
make
an
unbundled
element
available
at
a
rate
that
is
reasonable.
now,
the
commission,
if
we
assume
they
have
some
rulemaking
authority,
would,
i
take
it...
and
this
is
my
question...
at
least
have
authority
to
determine
when
a
rate
is
unreasonable.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
don't
mean
reasonableness
by
being
too
high.
i
mean
reasonableness
because
a
system
was
adopted
by
a
state
commission
that,
were
it
to
be
generalized
throughout
that
state,
would
seriously
undermine
the
purposes
of
the
act.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
do
i
have
to
choose
between
all
or
none?
that
is...
that
is,
could
we
view
the
word
rates
in
section
6
and
the
negative
phrase,
rulemaking
authority,
later
on
as
giving
the
commission
the
authority
to
say
when
something,
a
system,
for
example,
is
unreasonable,
but
not
to
dictate
which
among
several
systems
should...
the
state
should
use?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
thank
you.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
it
right...
i'm
thinking
in
my
mind
that...
for
example,
a
local
loop,
which
means
wires
that
go
under
the
street
to
my
house,
spread
out
throughout
a
city,
would
be
something
that
would
be
quite
difficult
for
a
new
competitor
to
do.
he'd
have
to
get
permission
from
the
city
council
and
dig
up
the
streets.
but
a
computer
which
handles
the
switching,
you
call
up
ibm
and
you
order
one.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
certainly
congress
here
thought
that
there
could
be
elements
of
the
system
where
it
would
be
possible
to
introduce
competition.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
so,
certainly
the
fcc
is
reasonable
in
trying
to
figure
out
which
those
elements
are.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
they
said,
we
don't
know,
and
since
we
don't
know,
we're
going
to
assume
that
what
those
elements
are
is
anything
that
somebody
wants.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
maybe
that's
the
best
they
can
do
before...
you
know,
you
say,
well,
we
tried.
come
up
with
something
better.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
suppose
they
have.
they
said,
you
don't
like
this.
you
think
this
is
silly
because
obviously
the
computer
is
different
from
the...
from
the
loop
going
into
a
person's
house,
and
one
you
can
order
from
ibm
and
the
other
you
can't.
very
well.
you
come
up
with
a
standard.
i
didn't
see
in
any
of
these
briefs
a
better
standard.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it's
on
page
a-3
of
the
appendix
there.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
page
a-3.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--i
have
it
at
page
a-3
of
professor
tribe's
brief.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
rather
missed
the
reason.
i
mean,
i
read
the
section,
but
i
missed
the
reason.
that
is...
maybe
i'll
say
what...
the
part
that's
bothering
me,
and
i
think
the
reason
they've
gotten
to
this
is,
if
i
saw
this
act
as
having
two
parts,
the
first
part
is
that
the
boc's
are
supposed
to
bring
competition
to
long
distance,
that
they
can't
do
that
because
the
others
said
we're
not
going
to
let
you
compete
with
us
unless
you
let
us
compete
with
you.
but
the
difficulty,
as
you
put
in
your
brief
very
well,
you
say
on
page
4
of
your
brief...
you
explained
it
beautifully...
that
there
are
large
elements
of
this
that
are
naturally
monopolistic,
loops,
et
cetera,
and
no
one
knows
where
they
break
off.
so,
their
complaint
is
that
what
happened
with
this
rule
is
it
says,
steve
breyer
or
you
or
anybody
else
in
the
world
could
go
to
bell
atlantic
and
say,
sell
us
your
whole
system.
now,
why
would
someone
do
that?
because
for
years
and
years
bell
atlantic
has
had
to
charge
high
prices
to
business
customers,
for
example,
because,
one,
the
universal
service,
but
also
because
of
allocation
rules
on
their
fixed
costs
which
shove
a
lot
of
the
fixed
costs
onto
business
people.
so,
you
or
i
can
make
a
fortune
by
buying
up
their
system,
and
using
this
telric
system,
which...
by
the
way,
the
best
criticism
of
which
comes
from
holmes
and
brandeis
in
missouri
v.
southwestern
bell.
but
regardless
of
that,
isn't
what
they
say
factually
true?
and
if
that's
factually
true,
how
could
that
be
consistent
with
a
statute
which
is
designed
to
allow
new
competition
in
some
but
not
all
elements,
indeed,
not
in
the
elements
that
you
state
on
page
4?
now,
that's
my
one
question,
but
it's
fairly
long
and
fairly
basic.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
if
you
can
answer
that,
you
will
go
a
long
way
towards
answering
the
question.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it
seems
virtually
inconceivable
intuitively
that
somebody
goes
and
says...
the
loop
costs
like
$30
a
month
or
something
and...
or
$12
a
month
and
the
chance
that
the
customer
who
has
it
attached
to
her
house
is
not
going
to
pay
the
$12
a
month
or
$14
or
something
like
that...
i
mean,
it's
conceivable
i
grant
you,
but
when
looking
through
those
three
paragraphs,
if
that's
what
the
fcc
is
driving
at,
i
think
they'd
have
to
use
some
example
that's
a
little
better
than
just
announcing
that
there
is
some
risk
that
the
loop
won't
be
paid
for.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
quite
sympathize
with
the
fcc
on
this.
you're
absolutely
right.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
the
reason
that
it's
so
serious
i
think
is
because
of
what
they
say
in
their
brief,
that...
that
given
the
present
structure
of
rates
and
given
the
fact
that
universal
system
subsidies
have
not
yet
come
into
effect,
to
follow
this
particular
system,
at
least
they
say,
runs
the
risk
that
people
will,
where
in
fact
fixed
costs
have
been
shoved
into
business
rates,
go
and
buy
this
wholesale
telric
thing
which
will
give
them
rates
that
are
well
below.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
on
the
other
hand,
where
you're
talking
about
residential
consumers,
what
they'll
do
is
they
there
will
appeal
to
the
resale
wholesale
business
for
a
totally
different
reason.
it's
because
those
costs
are
really
below
the
costs
of
providing
the
service,
and
that's
what
they're
worried
about.
and
i
don't...
in
reading
this,
i
didn't
see
an
answer
to
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
because
i
didn't
see
an
answer,
i
began
to
think,
well,
maybe
they're
right
in
saying
this
just
goes
too
far,
this
interpretation.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no.
i'm
not
so
much
thinking
of
them
because--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--i'm
really
thinking
of
residential
customers
who
weren't
getting
subsidies
in
a
straight
sense,
but
in
fact
they
were
not
bearing
a
proportionate
share
of
the
fixed
costs.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
maybe
that
comes
to
the
same
thing.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--kennedy
has
a
question.
go
ahead--
--you--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
suppose
they
only
had
6
months
in
the
statute.
so,
the
solicitor
general
says,
look,
this
isn't
perfect.
we
only
had
6
months.
we
had
to
do
the
best
we
can,
and
we'll
change
it--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--if
necessary.
