mr.
william
p.
barr
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
may
it
please
the
court:
i'm
bill
barr
and
i'm
representing
the
local
telephone
companies.
to
promote
local
phone
competition,
congress
granted
a
right
of
access
to
incumbent
facilities,
and
this
required
drawing
a
line,
a
line
through
the
business
of
the
local
telephone
companies.
on
one
side
of
the
line
where
no
access
is
granted,
the
entrants
are
told
here
is
where
you
can
and
should
compete.
here
is
where
you
put
in
your
inputs.
here
is
where
you
try
to
become
more
efficient.
that's
where
competition
is,
and
the
more
of
that
the
merrier.
on
the
other
side
of
the
line,
congress
says
there
may
be
areas
where
we
can't
have
competition
because
of
the
legacy
of
monopoly.
maybe
it
is
not
fair
to
ask
you
to
replicate
or
duplicate
the
input
of
the
incumbent,
and
so
here,
you
may
have
access.
now,
in
drawing
this
line,
congress
set
two
standards.
first,
it
said,
the
only
thing
you
can
get
access
to
are
network
facilities.
as
to
everything
else,
we
expect
you
to
compete.
you
put
in
your
inputs.
and
even
as
to
network
facilities,
you
don't
automatically
get
all
of
those.
we
want
you
to
compete
there
too
the
best
you
can,
but
if
the
fcc
finds
that
there
is
part
of
the
facility
that
you
need,
that
if
you
fail
to
get
it,
it
will
impair
your
ability
to
offer
service,
then
you
can
use
that
and
get
access
to
that
part.
now,
we're
not
here
today
because
we
are
quibbling
over
the
application
of
those
standards
and
think
the
line
should
be
drawn
a
little
bit
to
one
side
or
the
other.
we're
here
because
the
fcc
obliterated
those
lines.
they
did
not
apply
either
standard.
they
ended
up
by
saying
that
need
doesn't
mean
need,
it
means
technical
feasibility.
anything
you
can
possibly
get
access
to
you
must
get
access
to.
that's
their
rule.
and
as
to
network,
they
say,
network?
no,
no.
anything
that's
used
in
the
overall
commercial
offering
of
your
service
to
the
public...
anything...
anything
that
differentiates
you,
anything
that
makes
you
more
efficient
in
offering
to
the
public...
is
up
for
grabs.
so,
what
does
this
mean?
this
is
the
most
promiscuous
right
of
access
that
you
can
imagine.
and
to
use
the
metaphor
that
you
often
use,
justice
breyer,
about
the
spring
and
the
mousetrap,
they
haven't
take
our
spring.
they
haven't
taken
our
mousetrap.
they
haven't
stopped
there.
they're
taking
the
cheese.
[laughter]
now,
let's
look
at
what
they
did
on
need.
three
paragraphs
in
the
order
are
dispositive.
paragraphs
278,
285,
and
286.
congress
said
in
section
251(d)(2),
apply
a
need
based
standard,
determine
whether
their
failure
to
get
access
will
impair
their
ability
to
provide
service.
that's
what
you
have
to
consider.
what
do
they
do?
they
obliterate
that
standard.
they
adopt
a
rule
in
paragraphs
285
and
286
that
say
we
refuse
to
look
at
any
alternative
outside
the
incumbent's
network.
we
must
start
with
the
incumbent's
network.
we
close
our
eyes
and
put
on
blinders.
we
will
not
look
at
any
alternative
outside
the
incumbent's
network.
mr.
william
p.
barr
well--
mr.
william
p.
barr
--that...
that's
the
inquiry
that
should
have
been
made,
and
in
fact,
in
many
markets
there
are
many
facilities.
there
are
wires
into
the
home
from
cable
companies.
there
are
dozens
of
switches
in
major
metropolitan
areas
put
in
by
clec's,
competitive
lec's.
there's
more
fiber
under
the
streets
of
some
cities
than
there
is
concrete
above.
signaling
services
are
things
that
are
typically
bought
from
vendors.
many
ilec's,
many
incumbents,
don't
even
provide
their
own.
they
go
out
and
buy
it.
for
at&t
to
suggest...
they
were
the
manufacturers
of
switches
up
until
the
time
they
divested
lucent...
that
somehow
they
can't
get
a
switch
is
ludicrous.
there
are
many
things
to
look
out...
look
at
out
there.
but
that's
what
they
didn't
do.
they
didn't
make
the
inquiry,
and
by
definition,
that
violates
the
plain
meaning
of
any
need
standard.
whether
the
need
standard
is
indispensability,
reasonable
need,
a
little
need,
fairness,
to
apply
any
standard
other
than
want
or
than
technical
feasibility,
by
definition
you
have
to
look
at
the
alternatives.
how
can
you
tell
if
someone
is
hurt
or
impaired
unless
you
look
at
the
consequences
of
them
not
getting
access?
they
came
up
with
a
rule
that
says
we
take
access
as
a
given
in
every
case.
we
start
out
with
access.
now,
why
do
they
do
that?
this
is
the
interesting
thing.
they
do
that...
if
you
look
at
paragraph
278
of
their
order,
they
do
that
because
their
entire
premise
was
that
there
was
an
absolute
technical
feasibility
standard
and
anything
that
can
be
given
must
be
given.
they
got
that
by
misreading
a
provision
in
the
statute
that
said
access
must
be
given
to
an
element
at
any
technically
feasible
point.
so,
what
do
they
say
in
paragraph
278?
oh,
any
technically
feasible
point.
that
means
they
have
to
give
up
everything
that's
technically
feasible
to
give
up.
now,
the
eighth
circuit
knocked
them
down
on
that
and
said,
that's
ridiculous.
that
talks
to
the
point
of
access,
not
what
you
have
to
give
access
to.
but
what
the
eighth
circuit
failed
to
appreciate
is
that
just
seven
paragraphs
later
in
the
order,
when
they
encounter
the
need
standard,
the
fcc
scratches
its
head
and
says,
oh,
that's
funny.
there's
an
absolute
requirement
for
them
to
give
everything
and
here
there
seems
to
be
some
discussion
of
need.
what
do
we
do?
well--
mr.
william
p.
barr
--yes.
mr.
william
p.
barr
that's
joint
appendix
49,
your
honor.
mr.
william
p.
barr
it's
in
the
joint
appendix
at
page
49.
mr.
william
p.
barr
they
say,
gee,
how
do
we
reconcile
this
absolute
standard,
which
is
now
bogus?
they
have
not
appealed
the
eighth
circuit
order.
it's
a
bogus
standard.
and
they
say,
how
do
we
give
that
effect
to
this
so
called
absolute
right
of
access?
well,
we'll
read
the
need
standard
out
of
the
statute.
we'll
adopt
a
rule
that
says
you
never
look
beyond
the
incumbent's
network.
so,
our
point
is
they
refused
to
apply
the
standard
that
congress
told
them
to
apply.
they
adopted
a
rule
which
by
definition
contravenes
the
plain
meaning
of
a
need
or
an
impairment
standard,
and
they
did
all
of
this
premised
on
giving
an
effect
to
an
error,
something
they
haven't
even
appealed.
now
they
say,
well,
we
didn't
have
to
apply
the
standard--
mr.
william
p.
barr
--their
premise
was
that
the
language
technical
feasibility,
the
point
of
technical
feasibility
meant
not
just
the
point
at
which
you
grant
access
to
an
element,
but
that
you
have
to
give
access
to
every
element
that's
technically
feasible
to
give
access
to.
the
eighth
circuit
said,
no,
that's
not
right.
but
what
the
eighth
circuit
didn't
appreciate
is
that
seven
paragraphs
later--
mr.
william
p.
barr
--251(c)(3)--
mr.
william
p.
barr
--says
you
get
access
to
unbundled
elements
at
any
technically
feasible
point.
they
took
that
language
and
said,
that
means
you
get
access
to
every
element
that's
technically
feasible
to
get
access
to.
the
eighth
circuit
said,
no,
that
means
that,
assuming
you
get
access
to
an
element,
it's
at
the
technically
feasible
point.
mr.
william
p.
barr
no,
no.
that's
what
the
eighth
circuit
said.
278
says...
278,
which
is
their
order,
the
fcc
order
before
the
eighth
circuit
case,
said
we
interpret
at
any
technically
feasible
point
to
mean
you
have
to
give
access
to
everything.
mr.
william
p.
barr
then
seven
paragraphs
later,
when
they
come
across
the
need
standard,
they
say,
gee,
that's
funny.
there
seems
to
be
a
tension
here.
congress
told
us
to
give
access
to
everything.
this
seems
to
talk
about
need.
we'll
interpret
need
by
saying
you
never
look
outside
the
network.
you
always
assume
access
to
the
incumbent's
network.
you
start
out
with
saying
that
you
get
access
to
the
incumbent's
network.
you
never
look
to
see
if
there's
another
switch
in
the
market.
that
violates
the
plain
meaning
of
any
need
standard,
not
just
need
and
impairment
here,
but
any
standard
above
technical
feasibility.
so,
it
violates
the
plain
meaning
and
it's
premised...
the
whole
premise
of
their
approach
is
predicated
on
an
error,
an
error
that
was
detected
by
the
eighth
circuit,
an
error
which
they
have
not
appealed.
but
now
they
say,
well,
we
can
just
rely
on
what
people
want.
if
there's
something
out
there,
then...
then...
then...
the...
the
person
will
want
it.
the
entrant
will
take
it.
so,
we
don't
have
to
apply
a
need
standard.
the
problem
there
is,
congress
used
a
need
standard
precisely
because
it
knew
that...
that
entrants
sometimes
want
what
they
don't
need.
it
doesn't
make
a
differentiation
between
advantages
that
an
incumbent
may
have
that
flow
from
the
positive
forces
of
competition,
skill
and
innovation,
from
those
that
are
the
products
of
natural
monopoly.
so,
it
does
not
make
any
differentiation.
something
that...
that
a
incumbent
has
that's
a
good
thing
an
entrant
may
want,
but
maybe
they
don't
need
it
because
it
is
a
competitive
advantage
that
was
fairly
acquired
by
skill
and
innovation.
now,
let's
see
what
they
do
to
the
definition
of
network
element.
the
game
is
in
the
first
sentence
of
that
definition
which
is--
mr.
william
p.
barr
--what
the
fcc
should
have
done
was
to
engage
in
the
fundamental
task
here,
which
is
to
differentiate
what
are
the
advantages
and
the
things
about
the
incumbent's
business
that
can
be
fairly
competed
against,
that
can
be
counteracted
by
an
effective
competitor,
and
what
are
the
things
in
their
business
that
even
an
effective
competitor
could
not
reasonably
counteract
in
a
short
period
of
time
because
of
the
legacy
of
monopoly.
they
never
made
that
differentiation.
mr.
william
p.
barr
that's
absolutely--
mr.
william
p.
barr
--that's
absolutely
correct.
in
fact,
in
canada,
the
only
thing
unbundled
is
the
loop,
and
in
the
u.k.,
nothing
is...
nothing
is
made
available
because
cables
are
another
wire
under
the
house
and
they
could
be
made
two
way.
and
that's
why
10
percent
of
the
british
population
is
already
using
cable--
mr.
william
p.
barr
--absolutely.
mr.
william
p.
barr
they...
they
should
have.
they
didn't
try.
they
didn't
apply
a
need
standard.
mr.
william
p.
barr
well--
mr.
william
p.
barr
--that's
not
what
they
say
in
their
order.
they
didn't
say--
mr.
william
p.
barr
--well,
as
i
say,
number
one,
they
didn't
do
it,
and
number
two,
if
they
applied
that
standard,
it's
inconceivable
that
they
would
find
that
in
every
market,
every
competitor
needs
everything.
mr.
william
p.
barr
no,
it
doesn't
make
sense.
mr.
william
p.
barr
no.
if
they
had
used
a
cost
standard,
which
they
didn't
do,
they
didn't
apply
a...
just
a
pure
cost
standard.
remember,
they
just
said
technical
feasibility.
but
if
they
had,
i
would
be
here
saying
they
can't
do
that
either.
they
can't
do
that
either
because
all...
that...
that
assumes
that
all
advantages
that
the
incumbent
has...
all
advantages...
have
to
be
given
over,
even
those
that
a
good
competitor
could
counteract.
the
key
insight
here
is
that
you
don't
advance
competition
by
taking
things
that
a
competitor
could
actually
compete
on
and
turning
it
over
to
a
competitor.
mr.
william
p.
barr
yes.
we
are
dealing...
first,
i
would
bear
in
mind
that
we're
dealing
with
local
markets,
and
i...
and
the
fcc
promulgates...
has
the
tools
to
address
local
markets.
they
promulgate
rules
every
day
of
the
week
that
make
distinctions
between
concentrated
urban
markets
and
dispersed
rural
markets.
every
day
of
the
week.
moreover,
they
have
the
tool
of
arbitration
which
gets
you
down
to
a
carrier
by
carrier
level.
they
could
easily
say
in
new
york
where
there
are
dozens
of
switches,
in
new
york
where
there
are
companies
that
have
built
from
soup
to
nuts
entire
networks...
there
are
people
building
it
today
without
taking
any
of
our
pieces.
they
could
say
that
in
certain
markets,
certain
kinds
of
businesses
don't
need
certain
things.
the
notion
that
everybody
in
every
market
needs,
as
a
perquisite...
as
a
prerequisite
to
competition
everything
we
have
is
ludicrous.
mr.
william
p.
barr
because
people
will
want
what
they
don't
need.
for
example,
if
something
is--
mr.
william
p.
barr
--if
there
is
something
cheaper
out
there--
mr.
william
p.
barr
--there
are
two
examples.
if
something...
if
there's
an
alternative
that's
cheaper
out
there,
there
are
powerful
incentives
for
the
entrant
to
still
use
the
incumbent.
he
avoids
investment
risk
and
innovation
risk.
he
invests...
if
he
puts...
if
he
buys
his
own--
mr.
william
p.
barr
--excuse
me?
mr.
william
p.
barr
he
needs
it
to
avoid
competing.
that's
what...
that's
what
that
answer
is.
he
can
compete.
there's
an
alternative
out
there.
he
doesn't
want
to
use
it
because
he
wants
to
avoid
competing.
the
purpose
of
the
statute
is
to
make
him
compete.
now,
suppose
that
the
incumbent
has
something
that's
a
little
more
efficient.
the
fact
that
he
wants
it
doesn't
mean
he
needs
it
because
the
efficiency
may
come
from
skill
and
innovation,
not
as
a
legacy
of
the
natural
monopoly.
a
want
rule
is
not
the
same
as
a
need
rule.
and
they
made
no
inquiry
as
to
what's
available.
this
is
the
most
promiscuous
unbundling
rule
you
can
imagine.
it's
the
only
country
in
the
world
that
does
it
this
way,
and
that's
why
we're
behind
because
boards
of
directors
are
not
going
to
authorize
billions
of
dollars
of
investment
in
alternative
facilities
as
long
as
the
fcc
is
out
there
waving
total
access
at
telric
prices
which,
by
definition,
are
the
lowest
price
you
can
possibly
have
in
a
competitive
market.
now,
look
at
the
game
they
play
on
definition
of
the
element.
the
key
phrase
there
is
used
in
the
provision
of
the--
mr.
william
p.
barr
--section
153,
paragraph
29.
the
key
language
there
is
used
in
the
provision
of
a
telecommunications
service.
now,
what
they
try
to
say
is
used
in
the
provision
means
used
in
the
offering,
the
overall
commercial--
mr.
william
p.
barr
--it
is
section
153
of
the
statute,
paragraph
29.
mr.
william
p.
barr
the
statute.
it's
the
definition
of
network
elements.
they
say
used--
mr.
william
p.
barr
--it's
in
the
back
of...
of
our
brief,
the
red
brief.
mr.
william
p.
barr
153,
paragraph
29.
it's
the
definition
of
network
element.
that's
what
they
get
access
to,
or
that's
a
candidate
for
access,
if
they
need
it.
now,
the
whole
battle
is
in
that
first
sentence
because
that
tells
you
what
equipment
are
we
talking
about.
are
we
talking
about
equipment
in
the
business,
or
are
we
talking
about
some
other
kind
of
equipment
like
the
transmission
facility,
the
stuff
that
operates
it?
they
say--
mr.
william
p.
barr
--page
a-3
of
professor
tribe's
brief.
it's
the
first
page
on
our
brief
in
the
back
on
the
statute.
mr.
william
p.
barr
it
says
that
a
network
element
is
equipment
or
facilities
used
in
the
provision
of
a
telecommunications
service.
they
say
that
means
used
in
offering
to
the
public
the
service,
everything
that
goes
into
offering.
we
say
it
means
no.
it's
used
to
produce
the
service
that
is
offered.
it's
the
input,
the
equipment
input,
into
the
production,
the
generation
of
the
service.
mr.
william
p.
barr
their
definition
clearly
conflicts
with
the
statute.
mr.
william
p.
barr
number
one,
it
doesn't
comport
with
the...
with
the
word
network.
network
has
a
meaning,
a
common,
ordinary
meaning
of
the
wires
and
switches,
the
transmission
system.
second,
they...
they
are
deleting
the
word
provision
from
the
statute.
as
the
second
sentence
of
that
definition
shows,
provision
is
not
the
synonym
for
offering.
as
the
last
phrase
of
the
second
sentence
shows,
it
says,
transmission
routing
or
other
provision.
they're
talking
about
the
steps
in
producing
the
service,
the
steps
in
carrying
the
traffic.
mr.
william
p.
barr
no.
mr.
william
p.
barr
it's
or.
here's
how
it
works.
first,
you
tell
what
equipment
you're
talking
about.
that's
done
in
the
first
sentence.
the
work
done
in
the
first
sentence
is,
is
it
equipment
that's
in
the
transmission
facility
or
is
it
some
other
equipment?
the
second
sentence
then
says,
once
you
got
that
equipment,
it
includes
the
features
of
that
equipment
and
data
and
information
provided
by
that
equipment
that
is
either
sufficient
for
billing
or
used--
mr.
william
p.
barr
--of
such...
yes.
it's
provided
by
such
equipment.
it's
the
features
provided
by
such
equipment.
mr.
william
p.
barr
yes.
so,
equipment.
then
the
features
of
that
equipment.
then
information
generated
by
that
equipment
that's
used.
for
example--
mr.
william
p.
barr
--well,
it
would
include...
it
would
include
the
operator's
facility,
not
the
operator.
we
would
say
it's
the
equipment
input--
mr.
william
p.
barr
--because
an
operator,
we
would
say
is
not
a
facility.
mr.
william
p.
barr
that's
right.
a
capability
provided
by
the
physical
plant
is
included.
and
another
example
would
be
a
switch
captures
the
duration
of
a
call.
that's
information.
it
generates
a
record,
how
long
a
call
took.
that's
information
provided
by
means
of
the
equipment
that
we
have
to
make
available.
no
doubt
about
it.
the
point
is
whether
the
equipment
we're
talking
about
is
anything
we
used
in
offering...
anything
we
used
in
offering
or
anything
we
use
in
producing
the
service,
the
transmission
activities.
and
the
other...
the
legislative
history
makes
it
crystal
clear
that
what
congress
was
talking
about
was
the
bottleneck
facilities
which
they
defined
as
the
elements
needed
to
originate
or
terminate
a
telephone
call,
the
equipment
with
capabilities
of
routing
and
signaling
calls.
and
ultimately,
if
you
take
what
is
supposed
to
be
a
line
that
is
dividing
the
business
to
encourage
competition
wherever
it
can
occur,
and
you
say
it's
anything
in
the
business
that
gives
you
an
advantage
in
offering,
you've
obliterated
the
line.
but
let's
look
at
oss
as
an
example,
and
why
we
need
the
court's
intervention
here
is
because
they
adopted
this
sweeping
rule
with
no
limiting
principle--
mr.
william
p.
barr
--right,
the
predecessor
to
the
cia.
[laughter]
no.
it's
a
very
broad
category
of
operational
support
systems,
anything
in
our
business
that
supports
our
operations.
and
i'd
like
to
give
you
a
tangible
example
of
how
this
works.
we
develop
a
screen
that
comes
up
for
a
sales
representative
when
someone
calls.
let's
say
we
pulled
together
a
lot
of
information.
it
has
their
past
billing
records
and
their
records
of
interaction
with
us.
it
has
their
credit
history,
so
we
could
do
a
credit
history
check.
and
it
also
has
a
box
that
allows
us
to
activate
the
switch
and
turn
on
their
service.
now,
we
have
no
problems
giving
them
the
box
that
activates
the
service
because
that's
part
of
the
operation,
the
continued
operation,
of
the
transmission
system.
but
if
we've
developed
a
system
ourselves
that
let's
us
do
credit
checks
on
customers
and
let's
us,
you
know,
have
better
customer
care
because
we're
aware
of
the
whole
background
of
that
customer
and
their
interaction
with
us,
that
is
not
used
in
the
provision
of
the
service.
and
the
only
way
they're
getting
that
is
to
say
it's
used
in
the
general
offering.
and
if
you
look
at
paragraphs--
mr.
william
p.
barr
--no.
our...
the
outboard
equipment,
the
system,
the
oss
system,
which
is
outboard
of
the
network,
is
a
means
that
we
have
of
accessing
our
network
to
turn
it
on.
they
have
a
right
to
access
our
network
that's
nondiscriminatory.
so,
we
could
say
to
them,
put
in
your
remote
triggering
device
or
inherently
we
can
give
you
the
same
access
we
had.
you
can
use
our
system.
mr.
william
p.
barr
this
is
exactly
the
thing
that
the
fcc
didn't
do.
they
didn't
sort
out
what
is
necessary
to
operate
the
network
and
the
stuff
that
we've
developed
to
enhance
our
marketing.
and
they...
by
adopting
a
broad
category,
they
just
sweeped
it
all
in.
we're
not
asking
you
to
make
those
distinctions.
we're
saying
they
didn't
make
those
distinctions.
and
this
is
important
because
their
broad
rule
is
binding
on
the
states,
and
we're
facing
situations
in
the
states
where
we're
being...
people
are
coming
in
and
saying
your
people
have
to
put
velcro
patches
on
with
at&t
name
on
it.
your
trucks
have
to
have
magnetic
things
that
shift
back
and
forth.
at&t,
gte,
and
so
forth.
we...
we
need
a
principled
basis,
a
rule
for
them
to
apply
and
they
didn't...
and
they
didn't
do
that.
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
william
p.
barr
there's
a
pivotal
word
in
section
251(c)(3).
it's
the
word
on
an
unbundled
basis.
what
does
that
mean?
if
i
have
a
statute
that
says...
we
say
it
means
unbundled
from
the
whole.
so,
it
means
less
than
the
whole.
that's
what
you're
taking
under
that
provision.
if
i
have
a
statute
that
says
to
promote
automobile
manufacturers
and
it
says
you
can
buy
gm's
car
and
resell
it
if
you
want,
or
to
make
your
own
car,
you
can
get
parts
from
general
motors
on
an
unbundled
basis,
to
suggest
that
i
can
put
an
order
in
to
general
motors
saying
please
give
me
all
the
constituent
parts
of
a
car
on
a
preassembled
basis
so
i
get
the
same
output
unit
a
car,
and
if
that's
the
purpose
of
the
provision,
it's
ludicrous.
what
unbundled
means
in
every
context
i'm
aware
of
is
disaggregating
the
stuff
you're
taking
from
the
whole.
and
this
is
why
it
relates
back
to
the
need
inquiry.
what
the
fcc
was
supposed
to
do
was
say,
what
do
they
need,
what
don't
they
need.
and
the
stuff
they
don't
need
from
the
incumbent
they
provide
themselves,
and
in
order
to
induce
them
to
put
that
into
the
marketplace
so
you
have
competition
at
least
on
those
parts,
we
have
an
unbundling
provision
that
lets
them
get
the
rest
unbundled
from
the
whole.
so,
our
argument
is
that
that
provision
simply
is
not
available
to
go
in
and
engage
in
a
fiction
that
you're
getting
anything
on
an
unbundled
basis
when
you
buy
our
entire
network
from
stem
to
stern.
mr.
william
p.
barr
we
say--
mr.
william
p.
barr
--if
you...
if
you...
if
you
have
to
rely
on
everything
that
the
incumbent
has,
that's
why
resale
is
there.
resale
is
there
to
build
scale
so
you
can
deploy
facilities.
the
second
point
i
want
to
make
about
251(c)(3)
is
this
notion
that
there's
something
different
is
bogus.
there's
no
different
risk.
and
more
importantly,
because
you
pay
by
the
line,
by
the
month,
just
as
you
would
if
you
bought
it
resale
and
you
only
pay
for
what
you
actually
use
on
capacity.
but
the
more
important
point
is
the
opportunities
they
talk
about.
they
say,
oh,
we
have
all
these
opportunities
if
we
do
it
this
way.
please
focus.
those
opportunities
are
restatements
of
the
evasion.
they
say,
under
resale
we
can't
joint
market,
but
if
we
do
it
this
way,
we
have
the
additional
opportunity
of
selling
long
distance.
under
resale,
we
can't
provide
access,
but
if
we
do
it
this
way,
we
can
sell
access
as
well.
there's
no
new
input
by
them.
there
is
merely
evasion
of
the
restriction.
they
have
taken
the
position
that
it's
meant
to
induce
them
to
bring
inputs
into
the
marketplace,
partial
inputs
which
otherwise
couldn't
be
deployed
unless
they
could
fill
in
the
gaps
with
the
unbundling
provision,
and
converted
it
into
nothing
more
than
another
label
for
resale
without
the
restrictions.
mr.
william
p.
barr
i...
i...
i
would
like
someone
to
tell
that
to
the
chairman
of
at&t
because
they
have
been
standing
around
with
their
hands
in
their
pockets
for
3
years
talking
about
a
une
platform,
that
their
entry
strategy
was
to
buy
a
une
platform,
which
means
our
network,
nothing
different,
totally
our
network
under
the
fiction
that
they're
buying
pieces.
that
was
their
entry
strategy.
the
eighth
circuit
stopped
it,
and
so
they
finally
had
to
go
out
and
buy,
guess
what?
facilities,
tci
and...
and
a
teleport.
so,
they're
now
introducing
facilities
into
the
marketplace
because
the
scam
of
taking
a
free
ride
on
our
network
and
using
the
arbitrage...
the
person
that
is
hurt
by
arbitrage
is
aunt
tilly
because
the
money
that
the
business
people
are
paying
was
supposed
to
support
her
service.
what
the
fcc
rule
does
is
it
takes
that
money
and
diverts
into
the...
uses
it
as
a
subsidy
for
people
to
come
in
and
provide
potemkin
competition.
i'm
reselling
the
same
network
as
these
guys,
and
i'm
taking
the
money
that
was
supporting
aunt
tilly
and
putting
it
in
my
pocket.
