justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
staying
with
201(a)
for
just
a
minute,
if
the
suggestion
by
the
chief
justice
were
one
we
thought
correct,
and
the
first
sentence
in
(a)
was
a
limitation
on
the
rule...
the
last
sentence
in
the
rulemaking
authority
in
(b),
do
you
have
a
fall
back
position
with,
oh,
we're
really
talking
about
interstate
commerce
anyway?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
or...
or
is...
is...
would...
would
your
case
necessarily
founder
if
we
accepted
the
chief
justice's--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--suggestion?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
you
mean
they're
parts
of
the
act
that
don't
have
to
be
construed?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is
that
the
gravamen
of
your
argument?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
as
to
your
first
argument,
are
you
saying
that
the
act
has
changed
the
boundaries
between
what's
local
and
what's
interstate?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
the
1996--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--i
thought
that
you
could
say
that--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--that
it...
that
it
has
made
what
was
previously
thought
to
be
local
now
interstate.
so,
the
act...
so
the
prohibition
of
2(b)
is
irrelevant.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so,
then
justice
scalia
is
right,
that
2(b)
is
just
not
really
applicable
anymore.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so,
the
state
regulatory
authorities
would
be
given,
in
effect,
chevron
deference,
a
standard
similar
to
chevron
in
the
federal
system?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
then
that
would
seem
to
make
illusory
the
congressional
scheme
to
have
federal
review.
i
mean,
we
have
the
district
court
in
san
francisco
giving
deference
to
one
set
of
rules
and
in
new
york,
the
other.
that
doesn't
make
sense.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
as
i
interpret
the
solicitor
general's
argument,
at
least
from
the
brief,
there's...
one
line
is
between
interstate
and
intrastate.
another
line
is
between
what
the
act
covers
and
what
the
act
doesn't
cover.
and
i
think
it's
the
government's
position
that
they're
relying
more
on
the
latter,
that
this
act
covers
the
prices,
and
therefore
the
fcc's
authority
has
to
extend
to
that.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
we...
and
louisiana
did
not
address
that
point,
did
it?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
yes,
but--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--did
i
understand
you
to
answer
justice
breyer
that
the
commission,
fcc,
could
examine
whether
any
particular
application
of
a
rate
was
reasonable?
i
mean,
how
would
it
do
that?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what's
the
mechanism
for
it
doing
that
other
than
by
promoting
a
rule...
promulgating
the
rule?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so,
the
congress
limits
the
fcc
to
an
adjudicative
role?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
from...
from
an
economic
standpoint,
if
they
don't
need
it,
why
will
they
ask
for
it?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well--
[laughter]
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
that
sounds
maybe
like
some
of
the
old
day
telephone
companies,
not
the
new
telephone
companies.
[laughter]
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what
the
subsection?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what's
your
subsection?
153?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
it
said
provided
by
means
of
such
and
so.
if
you
have
an
answering
system,
an
operator,
a
411
operator,
live
operator,
she
or
he,
that
operator,
is
providing
that
service
by
means
of
the
physical
facility.
so,
it
would
include
that.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
why
wouldn't
it
include
the
operator
because--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--because
it
is
a
capability
provided
by
means
of
the
physical
plant.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
are
all
of
the
points
you
have
just
made
responsive
to
mr.
barr's
argument
that
the
commission
failed
to
heed
the
word
need
in
the
statute?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
yes.
