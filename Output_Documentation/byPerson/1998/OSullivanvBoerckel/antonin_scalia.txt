antonin
scalia
before
you
get
into
that,
i
don't
want
to
assume
that
it's
that
limited.
justice
antonin
scalia
we...
we
are
indeed...
i
mean,
we
do
try
to
take
up
here
path-breaking
cases,
and...
and
have
not
been
a
court
of
errors
for
many
years,
or
at
least
primarily
a
court
of
errors.
is
that
true
of
the
illinois
supreme
court?
my
impression
is
that
however
it
reads,
that
state
supreme
courts
in
general
and
the
illinois
supreme
court
in
particular
does
often
take
a
case
just
to
correct
a
mistake.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
see,
i
think
we're
tending
to
look
at
this
from
the
standpoint
of...
of...
we
have
a
rule
that
is
not...
not
very
dissimilar
from
the
illinois
supreme
court's
rule.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
the
way
we
apply
it,
we...
we
don't
purport
to
be
a
court
of
errors.
now,
is
that
a
fair
characterization
of
the
illinois
supreme
court?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
browers,
i'm
curious.
i'm
enormously
surprised
that
we
have
never
confronted
this
issue
before.
justice
antonin
scalia
do
you
have
any
explanation
for
that?
is
it...
is
it
that
when
issues
are
significant
enough
to
go
to
federal
habeas,
they
normally
are
carried
up
for
discretionary
review?
or...
i...
i
just
can't
understand
why...
why
this
thing
hasn't
come
up
before.
justice
antonin
scalia
did...
did
you
confirm
or...
or
by
silence
at
least,
the
statement
that
we
do
not
apply
the
exhaustion
requirement
to
state
habeas?
that
is,
we--
justice
antonin
scalia
--don't
we
require
state
habeas
to
be...
to
be
undergone
before
you
come
to
federal
habeas?
justice
antonin
scalia
excuse
me.
before
you
go
on
to
that,
do
you
know
whether
that...
you
know,
some
states...
virginia
i
know
before...
before
it
had
an
intermediate
court
of
appeals
and
every
appeal
to
the
supreme
court
was
discretionary
used
to
assert...
i
don't
know
whether
it
was
true...
that
cert
was
never
denied
unless
the
court
satisfied
itself
that
there
was
no
substantial
error.
justice
antonin
scalia
now,
might
not
some
state
supreme
courts
and,
for
all
i
know,
the
illinois
supreme
court
do
a...
do
a
quick
look
and
if
it...
if
it
has
no
reason...
at
least
no
reason
to
think
that
there
was
an
error,
deny
it,
but
if
it
has
reason
to
think
there
was
an
error,
grant
it?
i
mean--
justice
antonin
scalia
--we
don't
know
what
they're
doing
just
because
they
have
a
discretionary
system.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
virginia
had
the
same
rule.
it
wasn't
a
decision
on
the
merits.
it
didn't
purport
to
be,
but
nonetheless,
they
claimed
that
they
were
really
looking
for
those
cases
that
in
their
view
were
erroneous
and
would
grant
cert
if
there
was
any
real
possibility
of
an
error.
i
can't
say
for
sure
that...
that
virginia
doesn't
still
do
that
even
though
it
now
has
an
intermediate
court
or
that
some
other
states
don't
do
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
supervisory
authority.
i
mean,
that's
one
of
the
grounds
that
they
say,
and
what
in
the
world
could
that
cover
except
correcting
an
error?
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
i
know,
and
we...
we
have
the
same,
and
we
use
it,
you
know,
rarely
i
will
admit,
but
occasionally
we
take
a
case
just
because
we
think
it
was
wrongly
decided,
if
the
injustice
is
outrageous
enough.
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
trying
to
think
which...
which
course
would
more
likely
be
corrected
by
congress
if
we
get
it
wrong.
i
frankly
don't--
justice
antonin
scalia
i
frankly
don't
know
how
many
state
supreme
courts
will...
will
be...
what
should
i
say...
annoyed
if
we
come
out
the
way...
the
way
your
friend
wants
and...
and
as
you
assert,
dump
more
cases
in
their
laps
versus
how
many
would
be
offended
if
we
come
out
the
way
you
want
and...
and
go
about
reversing
state
court
decisions
when
the
state
court...
state
supreme
court
has
not
even
had
a
chance
to
hear
the
arguments
that
we
use
for
reversing
those
decisions.
i
don't
know
which
is
which.
justice
antonin
scalia
so,
you
know,
there
are
congressional
committees
that
can
hear
these
contentions
on
both
sides,
make
an
assessment.
and
which...
which
erroneous
result
do
you
think
would
more
likely
be
corrected
by
congress?
i
suspect
that
if
the
state
supreme
courts
in
general
were...
were
ticked
off
that
we
were
dumping
too
many
cases
in
their
laps,
that
they
would
make
their
voices
heard
pretty
quickly,
whereas
i
don't
think
anybody
is...
the
other
one...
i
can't
imagine.
i
don't
know.
justice
antonin
scalia
--no,
it's
not
a
feasible
system
for
any
large
state
to
say
that
you're
entitled
to
an
appeal.
is
that
what
you're
talking
about?
changing
their...
changing
their
discretionary
review
to
mandatory
review?
justice
antonin
scalia
maybe
the
little
states
can
do
that,
but
gee,
i...
i
cannot
imagine
any
state
with
a
substantial
number--
justice
antonin
scalia
--of
cases
being
able
to
have
the
supreme
court
review
every
one.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
bet
you
we
look
at
more
than
they
do?
you
think
we
look
at
more?
how
many...
how
many
do
they
look
at,
do
you
think?
i
mean,
we...
you
know,
you
come
here
from...
from
any
federal
question
from
any
state
or
federal...
any
federal
court
of
appeals
any
state
supreme
court.
justice
antonin
scalia
just...
just
to
come
back
to
the
statutory
text,
i'm
trying
to
think.
in
administrative
law
where
we
require
an
exhaustion
of
administrative
remedies
before
you
can
get
to...
to
a
federal
article
iii
court,
do
we
allow
you
to
dispense
with
the
level
of
administrative
review
that
is
just
discretionary?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
think
we
do.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
you
know,
let's
say...
let's
say
you're
going
through
this,
and
exhaustion
is
exhaustion.
justice
antonin
scalia
we
wouldn't
consider
the
administrative
remedies
to
have
been
exhausted.
and
i
don't
know
why,
if
we're
just
talking
the
terms
of
the
statute,
we
shouldn't
apply
the
same
rule
here.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
didn't
get
that.
say
it
again.
what
would
we
have
to
overturn?
justice
antonin
scalia
at
this
point,
there
aren't.
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
what...
can
you
think
of
one
case
you
say
that
we've
decided
that
stands
for
that
proposition?
justice
antonin
scalia
once
again,
we
certainly
wouldn't
use
the
term
that
way
in
administrative
law
where...
where
you
would
dismiss
a
case
for
failure
to
exhaust...
exhaust
administrative
remedies.
even
if
there
were
no
longer
any
administrative
remedies
available,
because
you
had
failed
to
appeal,
we
would...
we
would
dismiss
for
failure
to
exhaust.
now,
maybe
it
shouldn't
be
called
failure
to
exhaust.
maybe
it
should
be
called...
i
don't
know...
waiver
or
something
like
that,
but
we've
certainly
called
it
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
do
you...
what
do
you
say
about
the
consequence
which
follows
from
your
theory
which
is
that
even
where
the
issue
that
is
sought
to
be
raised
on
habeas
is
a
major
question
of
state
law
which
the
illinois
supreme
court
would
have
loved
to
reach?
since
there
is
no
requirement
to
bring
it,
you
don't
have
to
bring
it,
and
you
would...
you
would
say
there
is
no...
there
is
neither
a
failure
to
exhaust
nor
a
procedural
default
since
the...
whether
to
go
to
the
illinois
supreme
court
was
optional.
and
it's
a
major
issue
of
illinois
law
which
will
be
decided
by
a
federal...
a
federal
district
court
in
habeas
simply
because
the
prisoner
chose
not
to
bring
it
to
the
illinois
supreme
court.
justice
antonin
scalia
change
the
discretionary
review
to
mandatory
is
your
answer.
justice
antonin
scalia
anything
short
of
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
wow.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
federal
courts
would
have
to
decide
whether
a
particular
claim...
i
mean,
how
would
they
draw...
you
know,
issues
raising
major
issues
of
state...
a
federal
district
court
would
then
have
to
decide
whether
this
claim
raises
a
major
issue
of
state
law
because
if
it
does,
then
there
is
a
procedural
default,
and
if
it
doesn't,
there
is
not
a
procedural
default.
