to
go
back
to
justice
kennedy's
question
for
a
minute,
what
in
your
view
would
make
a
difference
if...
suppose
the
state
had
quite
clearly
said,
as
south
carolina
has
said,
they
said
in
a...
they
published
something
called
in
re
exhaustion
of
state
remedies.
and...
and
in
that
document,
they
say,
we
declare
that
all
appeals
from
criminal
convictions,
a
litigant
shall
not
be
require
to
petition
for
certiorari
to
the
state
supreme
court
in
order
to
be
deemed
to
have
exhausted
all
available
state
remedies.
all
right.
now,
so
that
couldn't
be
clearer.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so,
in
other
words,
your
view
is
that
even
if
the
state
of
illinois
were
to
say,
we've
thought
about
this
matter.
we
understand,
says
the
supreme
court,
that
if
we
say
you
don't
have
to
exhaust
in
trivial
cases,
we're
also
saying
you
don't
have
to
exhaust
in
important
ones.
we
understand
that,
and
we
don't
want
to
hear
them.
we
don't
want
it.
we
don't
want
all
that
flood
of
things.
that's
our
policy.
nonetheless,
we
would
have
to
say
to
the
state
prisoners,
you
have
to
go
to
the
supreme
court.
now,
why
should
that
be?
we
don't
say
that
about
post-conviction
release...
relief
in
states.
why
would
we
have
to
say
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
understand
it's
a
federal
question.
i'm
just
saying
that
given
our
reading
of
the
language
of
the
statute,
the
federal
statute,
a
reading
that
does
not
take
it
literally
because
we
do
not
apply
it
to
state
habeas,
nor
a
lot
of
other
things,
a
reading
that
looks
to
the
policy,
if
we
discover
that
the
policy
in
respect
to
comity
is
that
the
state
thinks
comity
means
don't
give
it
to
us,
please,
don't
insist
on
this
flood,
that
we
should,
nonetheless,
insist
on
it.
now,
i
know
maybe
the
ninth
circuit
or
somebody
has
said
that's
so,
but
i
want
to
know
why
should
that
be
so.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
a
different--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--i
come
to
that
after
the
first
one.
i
want
to
know...
i
want
to
know
suppose
i
decide
you're
wrong
on
that
or
i
decide
it's
ambiguous.
i
don't
know
how...
i'm
saying
suppose
the
state
were
clearly
to
say
we
don't
want
this
in
the
state
supreme
court.
go
to
federal
district
court.
they
don't
have
enough
to
do.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
they
don't
say
that.
they
say
it's
our
policy,
i.e.,
we
consider
the...
the
matter
to
have
been
exhausted
for
federal
habeas
purposes
just
like
south
carolina
said.
so,
you're
not
bothering
us
to
say
avoid
the
state
supreme
court.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
don't
know,
but
i
want
to
know
your...
my
problem
legally
is
am
i
or
am
i
not
supposed
to
give
that
weight.
now,
if
i
am,
i'm
going
to
see
it
one
way.
if
i'm
not,
i'm
going
to
see
it
another
way.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it's
not...
you
see,
it's
not
useless.
mr.
browers,
i...
some...
some
of
this
colloquy
leaves
me
perplexed.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
i
don't
know
the
status
of
that
specifically.
i
believe
that
there's--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--well,
there's
a
lot
of
water
that's
flowed
under
the
bridge
since
brown
against
allen
i
think.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
i'm
testing
out...
and
i
suppose
you
don't
have
an
answer
to
it...
was
justice
kennedy's
point.
does
it
matter
or
doesn't
it
matter
whether
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
would
or
would
not
prefer
to
get
this
flood
of
petitions?
i
don't
mean
to
be
pejorative
there.
i
mean--
