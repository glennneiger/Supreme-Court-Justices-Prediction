mr.
william
l.
browers
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
discretionary
review
by
a
state's
highest
court
should
be
recognized
as
an
available
remedy
to
vindicate
federal
constitutional
interests
before
one
comes
to
federal
habeas
court.
the
recognition
of
this
as
an
available
remedy
would
foster
concerns
of
comity
and
federalism
which
have
been
the
driving
forces
of
this
court's
habeas
jurisprudence
for
many
years.
the
defendant,
darren
boerckel,
brought
three
claims
to
federal
habeas
court
which
he
had
raised
on
review
to
the
illinois
appellate
court,
but
failed
to
raise
in
his
petition
for
leave
to
the
illinois
supreme
court,
which
he
filed.
his
failure
to
avail
himself
of
the
remedy
of
a
petition
for
leave
to
appeal
as
to
these
issues
should
preclude
his
bringing
them
in
federal
habeas--
mr.
william
l.
browers
--in
mr.
boerckel's
case,
mr.
boerckel
had
counsel.
counsel
is
typically
not
provided.
mr.
william
l.
browers
there's
no--
mr.
william
l.
browers
--i
have
to
give
you
a
mixed
response
to
that.
there's
no
constitutional
right
or
even
statutory
right
to
counsel.
the
reality,
though,
is
the
appellate
public
defender
system
opts
sometimes
to
file
petitions
for
leave
on
their
behalf.
in
mr.
boerckel's
case,
he
was
represented
by
a
private
counsel,
but
i
acknowledge
there
are
many
pro
se
petitions
filed.
mr.
william
l.
browers
i
would
assume.
mr.
william
l.
browers
i
would
assume.
mr.
william
l.
browers
to
some
extent.
mr.
william
l.
browers
no,
i
haven't.
mr.
william
l.
browers
if
it's
available,
i
neglected
to
include
that.
i
am
not
asking
necessarily
for
a
uniform
rule
here.
the
states
are
entitled
to
give
whatever
remedies
they
will.
mr.
william
l.
browers
i
beg
to
differ,
your
honor.
i
think
the
driving
force
here
is
28
u.s.c.
2254(c),
and
it
speaks
to
the
right
under
this
law
of
the
state
to
raise,
by
any
available
procedure,
the
question
presented.
the
full
provision
is
quoted
at
pages
16
and
17
of
our
brief.
the
question
is
one
for
the
federal
courts
to
determine
whether
any
one
state
court
provides
such
a
remedy.
so,
the
question
here
is,
in
terms
of
mr.
boerckel's
case,
does
illinois
supreme
court
rule
315
provide
such
a
remedy?
we
disagree
with
the
seventh
circuit
as
to
what
that
rule
provides.
mr.
william
l.
browers
no.
i'm
taking
a
global
approach,
but
i
could
theoretically...
i
could
theorize
a
state
in
which,
for
example,
a
state
might
say
we
will
not
hear
federal
constitutional
claims.
for
federal
habeas
purposes,
whether
that
would
be
a
legitimate
rule
or
not--
mr.
william
l.
browers
--no,
he
must
not...
he
need
not.
but
state
habeas
is
very
different
from
federal
habeas.
and
that
analogy
breaks
down
in
prior
seventh
circuit
decisions,
one
of
which
is
cited
in
this
decision,
called
hogan
v.
mcbride,
which
is
an
indiana
case,
and
gomoz
v.
ditello,
which
is
an
illinois
case.
that's
what
the
seventh
circuit
tried
to
do,
to
see
whether
there
would
be
a
default
under
illinois
law
for
failure
to
take
a
petition
for
leave
to
appeal.
the
analogy
would
run
that
state
habeas,
which
is
called
post-conviction
in
illinois,
is
somehow
analogous
to
federal
habeas.
nothing
could
be
further
than
the
truth.
in
state
post-conviction
law,
you
can
only
bring
extra-record
claims
that
could
not
have
been
brought
on
direct
appeal
or
were
not
brought
on
direct
appeal.
whereas,
in
federal
habeas,
you
can
only--
mr.
william
l.
browers
--it
would
be
an
irrelevancy
under
state
law.
mr.
william
l.
browers
if
you
had
a
record
claim,
regardless
of
whether
you
did
a
petition
for
leave
to
appeal
or
not,
it
wouldn't
be
a
claim
that
could
be
brought.
mr.
william
l.
browers
no,
you
don't.
you
don't.
mr.
william
l.
browers
but
you
would
be
limited
in
what
you...
you're
always
limited
in
what
you
can
raise
on
what
we'll
call
state
habeas,
which
is--
mr.
william
l.
browers
--exactly.
mr.
william
l.
browers
they're
completely
unrelated,
and
the
analogy
to
federal
habeas
completely
breaks
down.
one
cannot
bring
in
federal
habeas
that
which
they
haven't
brought
in
the
state
courts.
so,
any
attempt
to
look
at
what
illinois
does
internally
has
no
relevance
in
the
federal
picture
at
all.
mr.
william
l.
browers
well,
we
would
take
issue
with
that...
with
the
supposed
signals
that
the
illinois
supreme
court
gives.
the
initial
wording
of
their
rule
315
is,
the
following,
while
neither
controlling
nor
fully
measuring
the
court's
discretion,
indicate
the
character
of
reasons
which
would
be
considered.
and
then
they
follow
with
the
list.
mr.
william
l.
browers
the
list
may
be,
but
it
doesn't
list...
it
does
not
limit
their--
mr.
william
l.
browers
--assume
it's
that
limited.
let's
just
assume
it's
that
limited.
we
have
to
look
at
the
nature
of
habeas
relief
itself.
first
of
all,
in
terms
of
fact-specific--
mr.
william
l.
browers
--well,
i
don't
assume
so--
mr.
william
l.
browers
--sure,
they
do.
sure,
they
do.
i
have
three
cases
cited
in
the
reply
brief--
mr.
william
l.
browers
--i
understand.
mr.
william
l.
browers
i
don't
think
their
jurisprudence
is
quite
like
this
court's,
however
much
the
rules
may
read
the
same.
they
do
error
correction.
mr.
william
l.
browers
i
gave
those
two
or
three
examples
because
they
raise
the
precise
issues
that
darren
boerckel
failed
to
raise.
mr.
william
l.
browers
and
i
limited
myself
to
the
discretionary
docket
of
that
court.
i
eliminated
all
the
capital
cases.
did
i
do
a
statistical
survey?
i
don't
have
statistics.
i'm
sorry.
mr.
william
l.
browers
this
is
not
atypical
at
all
for
that
court.
mr.
william
l.
browers
there's
another
aspect
i
can
tell
you...
and
i
can
only
tell
you
in
a
sort
of
anecdotal
sense.
the
supreme
court's
rule
discusses
the
need
for
exercise
of
the
supreme
court's
supervisory
authority.
the
illinois
supreme
court
as
the
supervising
court
over
all
other
courts
in
illinois
frequently,
from
its
discretionary
docket,
will
deny
leave
and
simultaneously
issue
a
supervisory
order
directing
the
lower
court
to
reconsider
a
decision
in
light
of
an
intervening
precedent.
sometimes
the
court
does
it
because
the
very
issue
has
been
raised
in
a
petition
for
leave
to
appeal.
sometimes
the
court
does
it
because
it
sees...
it
reads
the
appellate
court
decision,
sees
that
issue
lingering
there,
knows
they've
spoken
in
that
area
of
jurisprudence,
and
still
remands
for
reconsideration.
i've
had
this
happen
a
number
of
times
in
our
office
and
at
my
former
employer
where
i
did
prosecution
appeals
for
many
years.
they...
their
jurisprudence
is
not
like
this
court's.
they
do
error
correction.
but
even
if
they
didn't,
the
opportunity
is
there
and
i
think
it's
insulting
to
freeze
a
state
supreme
court
out
of
the
equation
when
somebody
is
coming
on
habeas
review.
mr.
william
l.
browers
i'm
not
sure
that's
the
case.
i
don't
think
darren
boerckel
has
given
empirical
evidence
that
would
show
that--
mr.
william
l.
browers
--i'm
not
sure
that
the
state's
rules
were
designed
looking
toward
federal
habeas.
mr.
william
l.
browers
they're
giving
evidence
of
relief
within
the
state
system
to
petitioners.
darren
boerckel
is
a
perfect
example.
he
didn't
avoid
going
to
the
illinois
supreme
court.
he
just
didn't
bring
these
three
issues.
but
then
again,
the
ones
he
did
bring
were
fairly
fact-specific
and--
mr.
william
l.
browers
--i'm
not...
i'm
not
sure
the
illinois
supreme
court
would
object
to
that,
and
i'm
not
sure
that
it
would
lead
to
either.
i
think
the
inquiry
really
needs
to
be
here
to
look
at
the
nature
of
federal
habeas.
in
brecht
v.
abramson,
this
court
described
it
as
an
extraordinary
remedy
for
those
who
are
grievously
wronged
and
something
qualitatively
different
than
reversible
error
on
a
direct
appeal.
now,
if
claims
are
so
extraordinary,
like
darren
boerckel's,
that
they're
to
be
brought
into
federal
court,
why
are
they
too
extraordinary
for
a
state
supreme
court?
the...
the
notion
that
a
claim
is
merely
fact-specific
or
generic
and
not
of
general
importance,
there
really
aren't
that
many
cases
of
a
constitutional
type
that
aren't
going
to
be
fact-specific.
it
would
generally
be
facial
challenges
to
the
constitutionality
of
a
statute
and--
mr.
william
l.
browers
--i
would
say
that.
i
don't
think
there's
any
discouragement
there.
does
the
prisoner
look
at
his
chances
and
look
at
this
rule
and
say
my
chances
are
minimal,
it's
not
worth
going?
perhaps,
although
the
data
don't
bear
that
out.
mr.
william
l.
browers
what?
mr.
william
l.
browers
i
think
so,
and
i
think
habeas
petitioners...
this
one
in
particular
is
going
for
four.
he's
been
to
this
court
before
on
certiorari
with,
i
might
add,
a
fact-specific
question
right
on
the
heels
of
dunway
v.
new
york.
he's
been
through
three
levels
of...
he's
been
through
various
levels
of
review
in
the
state
court,
and
now
he's
in
federal
habeas
court.
mr.
william
l.
browers
i
am
too.
mr.
william
l.
browers
i
don't
either.
i
think
there
have
been
hints
in
various
opinions...
three
on
the
same
day
i
believe,
teague
v.
lane,
castille
v.
peoples,
and
harris
v.
reed...
both
in
the
majority
opinions
and
in
concurrences
and
footnotes
all
alluded
to
this
possibility
in
discussion
of
exhaustion
and
how
the
plain
statement
rule
of
harris
may
not
apply
where
no
one
gave
the
state
the
opportunity.
the
various
circuit
courts
of
appeals,
cited
in
footnote
32,
i
believe
it
is,
of
our
brief...
those
that
accept
our
position
rely
on
those
very
precedents,
as
well
as
footnote
48
of
engle
v.
isaac
and
footnote
1
of
coleman
v.
thompson.
so,
it's
all
sort
of
been
suggested
by
your
honors'
jurisprudence.
i'm
not
sure
why
the
issue
hasn't
come
here.
some
states
maybe
don't
promote
it.
i
don't
know.
mr.
william
l.
browers
i
think
that's
an
irrelevancy,
your
honor.
mr.
william
l.
browers
exhaustion
is
a
federal
question.
mr.
william
l.
browers
i
understand
the
lure
of
that,
and
in
fact,
boerckel
relies
on
arizona
precedent
doing
precisely
that.
but
the
ninth
circuit
said,
no,
no,
no,
no.
this
is
a
federal
question.
mr.
william
l.
browers
well,
i
mean,
this
is
the
reverse.
this
is
the
state
telling--
mr.
william
l.
browers
--the
federal
courts
what
to
do?
mr.
william
l.
browers
i
think
short
of
a
state
saying
we
won't
entertain
your
claim
at
all--
mr.
william
l.
browers
--i
wonder
what
that
same
court
will
do
later.
mr.
william
l.
browers
i
mean,
there's...
there
is
jurisprudence
of
this
court
that
says
a
useless
resort
to
state
court
will
be
forgiven.
mr.
william
l.
browers
no.
i
don't
accept
that.
mr.
william
l.
browers
depending
on
the
issue
raised
in
federal
habeas
and
depending
on
what
was
done
in
the
state
court.
i
was
not
confirming
that
by
silence.
mr.
william
l.
browers
i
believe
it's
brown
v.
allen
that
holds
that
one
need
not
do
a
redundant
state
habeas
raising
the
very
issues
one
raised
on
direct
appeal.
mr.
william
l.
browers
i
acknowledge
that.
i...
i
think
that
aspect
of
this
court's
jurisprudence
regarding
exhaustion
remains
valid,
that
the
states...
that
the
federal
courts
will
not
require
a
petitioner
to
do
a
redundant
action
in
state
court.
mr.
william
l.
browers
i
understand.
i
think
that
makes
a
presumption
that
this
would
increase
the
number
of
petitions.
i'm
in
a
unique
position
at
my
desk
where
virtually
every
petition
that
they
get
crosses
my
desk
to
know
that...
let
me
back
up.
for
11
years
in
the
seventh
circuit,
the
rule
was
the
opposite
of
the
rule
in
this
case.
there
was
a
case
called
nutall
v.
greer,
which
held
that
the
words
exhaustion
were
not
used.
they
were...
it
was
in
language
called
waiver.
and
from
1985
to
1996,
the
rule
in
the
seventh
circuit
was
that
you
did
have
to
raise
your
claims
on
a
petition
for
leave
to
appeal
in
the
illinois
supreme
court
in
order
to
exhaust
them
for
habeas
purposes.
in
1996,
the
seventh
circuit
reversed
itself.
i
haven't
seen
any
appreciable
increase
or
decrease
in
petitions
for
leave.
i
think
petitioners
go
there
initially
hoping
to
get
relief
in
the
state
courts
and
not
necessarily
with
an
eye
toward
federal
habeas
corpus.
so,
i
don't
accept
the
proposition
that
this
will
encourage
an
increase
of
either
issues
or
petitions
in
the
illinois
supreme
court.
mr.
william
l.
browers
no.
mr.
william
l.
browers
the
only
exception
i
think
would
be
rational,
since
the
question
is
a
federal
one,
is
if
you
have
a
state
that
has
a
rule
that
on
its
face
shows
that
relief
is
impossible
with
respect
to
federal
questions.
mr.
william
l.
browers
well,
i'm
not
sure
the
attitude
of
the
state
is
as
important
as
what
its
rule
is.
i
am
seeking
a
national
rule,
and
for
those
states
for
which
no
relief
would
be
available
within
the
wording
of
2254(c),
they
would
have
to
be
the
exception
to
the
rule
we'd
promote.
mr.
william
l.
browers
not
discourage--
mr.
william
l.
browers
--exactly.
that's
our--
mr.
william
l.
browers
--if
they
don't
hear
criminal
matters,
i
would
say
that's
not
an
available
remedy.
mr.
william
l.
browers
i
get
what
i
can
here.
i'd
like
to
reiterate
the
point
that--
mr.
william
l.
browers
--no,
i
don't.
i
would
assume
most.
but
i'd
like
to
back
up
to
your
question.
i
don't
think
this
encourages
laundry
list
petitions.
i
think
one
has
to
look
at
what
is
one
seeking
in
habeas,
and
to
the
extent
that
one
is
seeking
to
vindicate
constitutional
errors
where
one
has
been
grievously
wronged,
i
don't
think
inclusion
of
that
in
a
petition
for
leave
to
appeal
to
a
state's
highest
court
can
be
deemed
so
minimal
as
a
laundry
list.
i
think
it's
a
serious
constitutional
claim,
and
if
one
is
really
there,
however
fact-bound
it
is,
it's
not
onerous
to
require
a
petitioner
to
raise
it.
no
further
questions.
i'll
reserve
my
time.
