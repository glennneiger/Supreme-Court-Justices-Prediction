justice
david
h.
souter
well,
i
understood
you
to
say
that
on
state
habeas,
you
couldn't
raise
anything
that
you
could
have
raised
in
your
direct
appeal.
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
so,
there...
i
see.
justice
david
h.
souter
mr.
browers,
i
think
i...
i
would
not
have
difficulty
in
accepting
your...
your
general
proposition
that
if
there
is
discretionary...
that
if
there
is
an
avenue
of
discretionary
relief
available
under
the
state,
a...
a
defendant
must
pursue
it
and
exhaust.
but
here
there
seems
to
be
a
further
feature.
the
feature
here
is
that
the...
that
the
statute
providing...
i'm
sorry...
that
the
rules
of
the
court
that
implement
this
discretionary
avenue
of
appeal
to
the
state
supreme
court
give
some
examples
of
the
sorts
of
things
that
they
are
interested
in
in
exercising
their
discretion.
and
as
the...
as
the
i
think
the
chief
justice
alluded
to
a
moment
ago,
they...
they
sound
like...
they
sound
like
sort
of,
for
lack
of
a
better
term,
broad
policy
questions,
path-breaking
kinds
of
questions,
rather
than
fact
or
case-specific
questions.
this
particular
petitioner
had
what
sounded
to
me
like
the
most
case-specific
questions
in
the
world,
you
know,
was...
was
my...
was
my
confession
truly
voluntary
and
so
on.
when
a
state
gives
signals,
as
i
think
the
illinois
supreme
court
has
given
signals,
about
what
it
is
interested
in,
why
then
shouldn't
the
rule
be
that
if
your
case
does
not
fall
within
the
kinds
of
examples
that
the
state
supreme
court
says
it's
interested
in,
you
don't
have
to
exhaust
because
it
would
be
futile
to
do
it,
or
almost
always
futile?
i
realize
there
may
be
exceptions,
but
it
would
almost
always
be
futile.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
they...
i
don't
have
a...
the
list
is
pretty
much
path-breaking
kind
of
questions
rather
than
the
fact...
case
fact-specific
questions,
is
it
not?
justice
david
h.
souter
you're
quite
right.
it
says
these
are
not
controlling.
these
are
not
exclusive.
but
this
is...
this
is
in
principle
what
we're
interested
in.
isn't
that
what
it
says?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
you
gave...
let's
see
if
we
can
get
down
to
specifics.
you
gave
two
or
three
examples,
as
i
recall,
in
the
yellow
brief.
that's
would
have...
two
or
three
examples
out
of
how
many
cases
over
what
period
of
time?
i
mean,
what
are
we
really
talking
about?
justice
david
h.
souter
yes.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
tell
me,
you
know...
and
your...
your
best
good
faith
is
okay
with
me.
justice
david
h.
souter
it's...
so
that
there
are...
there
are
lots
of
these
cases.
justice
david
h.
souter
what
about...
i
thought
you
were
going
to
get
down
to
a
comment
specifically
on
sort
of
the
number
of
error
correction
cases
that
in
one
way
or
another
the
supreme
court
of...
of
the
state
does
entertain.
your...
your
brother,
in
effect,
said
to
me
it
entertains
a
good
many
of
them.
is
that...
is
that
not
true?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
let
me...
let
me
ask
you
a
broader
question.
i
mean,
the
state's
counsel
said,
look,
i
just
cited
two
or
three
cases
because
they
were
very
close
in
their
subject
matter
to...
to
this
particular
case.
but
he
said
that
generally
speaking,
over
the
whole
spectrum
of
the
criminal
law,
either
because
it
actually
reviews
or
because
it...
it
will
remit
to
a...
a
lower
court
for
review
under
its
supervisory
authority,
the...
the
supreme
court
actually
entertains
a...
a
large
number...
lots
i
think
was
the
term
i
used
in...
in
commenting
on
his
answer...
lots
of
these
cases
which
seem
to
be
error
correction
cases.
as
a
general
proposition,
do
you
dispute
that?
