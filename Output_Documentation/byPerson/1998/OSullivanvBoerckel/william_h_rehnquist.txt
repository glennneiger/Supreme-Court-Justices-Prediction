chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
no.
97-2048,
william
o'sullivan
v.
darren
boerckel.
mr.
browers.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
feel
you
can
speak
for
the
practice
outside
of
illinois,
mr.
browers?
did
you--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--have
you
practiced
other
places?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
there
some
research
that
is
available?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
seventh
circuit
opinion,
as
i
read
it,
put
great
stress
on
the
fact
that
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
did
not
wish
to
get
involved
in
a
lot
of
these
things.
it
reserved
it
for
itself
questions
that
it
regarded
probably
more
path-breaking
than
typical
error
correction.
but
we
really...
we
can't
have
a
state-by-state
breakdown
on
this
thing
if
the
supreme
court
of
minnesota
felt
differently
that
the
rule
would
be
differently...
different
in
the
eighth
circuit
than
the
seventh
circuit.
i
think
we
have
to
have
some
sort
of
a
national...
national
rule.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
browers,
to
me
this
discussion
indicates
that
the
point
on
which
you
and
i
disagree,
that
there
has
to
be
some
national
rule,
and
you
say,
no,
it
can
just
be
state
by
state,
that
a
national
rule
is
going
to
be
very,
very
difficult
to
put
together
particularly
if
any
part
of
the
rule
depends
on
the
attitude
of
the
highest
court
of
the
state,
and
you've
got
50
different
states.
i
wonder
if
we
don't
need
something
more
general
than
that.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so,
you
say
no
relief
legally
possible,
not
discretion--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--rarely
exercised
in
favor
of
it.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it'd
be
like
texas
where
the
state
supreme
court
doesn't
hear
criminal
matters.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
correct.
that's
not
much
of
a
concession.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
browers.
mr.
mote,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
mote,
do
you
think
that
the
answer
to
the
questions
posed
in
the
petition
here
should
depend,
to
any
substantial
degree,
on
the
likelihood
of
success
in
a
petition
to
the
illinois
supreme
court
as
opposed
to
a
likelihood
of
success
in
some
other
state
supreme
court
and
where
there's
an
intermediate
court
of
appeals?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
say
override
the
view
of
the
illinois
supreme
court.
in
the
sense
that
has
been
previously
discussed?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
not
every
potential
habeas
litigant
is
going
to
have
a
garden
variety
case,
you
know,
with
15
errors
and
you
hope
one
of
them
is...
is
found...
finds
favor
with
the
court.
on
occasion
there's...
there's
going
to
be
a
case
that
is...
is
a
precedent-setting
case,
and
under
the
rule
you're
contending
for,
that
too
need
not
be
taken
to
the
supreme
court
of
illinois.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that...
that
is
going
to
leave
habeas
courts
trying
to
decide
what
factors
that
are
concededly
not
dispositive
mean,
which
strikes
me
as
introducing
a
great
deal
of
subjectivity
among
the
700
district
judges
in
the
country.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
if...
if
we're
talking
about
ease
of
administration,
which
may
not
be
the
final
criterion,
certainly
as...
as
easy
a
rule
to
administer
as
any
is
to
say
if
you
could
have
applied
to
the
supreme
court
of
illinois,
you...
you
had
to.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that...
that
doesn't
take
a
lot
of
thinking
on
anybody's
part
to
apply
that
rule.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
then
you're
saying
that
procedural
default
is
the...
the
what
we're
talking
about
here
rather
than
failure
to
exhaust.
supposing
that
you
don't
take
an
appeal
from
a
judgment
of
conviction
to
the
illinois
appellate
court
where
you
have
appeal
as
of
right,
and
the
time
for
that
goes
by,
is
that
a
failure
to
exhaust
or
is
that
a
waiver?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so,
once
the
remedy
is
gone
under
the
terms
of
state
law,
it's
no
longer
a
question
of
failure
to
exhaust.
it's
a
procedural
default.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
don't
think
it
was
a
question.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
mote.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
97-2048,
o'sullivan
against
boerckel
will
be
announced
by
justice
o'connor.
