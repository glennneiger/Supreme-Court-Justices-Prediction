justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
thought
you
were
speaking
across
the
board
that
as
long
as
there
is
an
avenue,
even
if
it's
discretionary.
so,
i
don't
understand
your
response
to
the
chief
justice.
i
thought
you
were
taking
the
position
that
you
must
exhaust
discretionary,
as
well
as
mandatory
remedies
and
that
you
weren't
taking
a
state-by-state
approach.
but
am
i
incorrect
in
that
understanding?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
let's
stick
in...
with
your
own
state
and...
and
what
is
the
picture
with
respect
to
state
habeas?
for
a
prisoner
to
avail
himself
of
state
habeas,
must
he
exhaust
not
only
his
appeal
of
right,
but
also
his
petition
to
the
illinois
supreme
court?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
may
i
ask,
you
couldn't
get
state
habeas
if
you
had
let
your
appeal
of
right
pass
by,
could
you?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it
would
be--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--not
a
petition
for
leave
to
appeal.
do
you
have
to
exhaust
anything
to
raise
whatever
you
can
raise
on
state
habeas?
i
thought
that
you
had
to
take...
pursue
your
appeal
of
right.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
don't.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
that's
one
line
that
could
be
drawn.
another
one
is
between
appeals
of
right
and
discretionary
appeals,
and
then
you'd
have
a
national
uniform
rule
based
on
that
line.
but
you
say
that
the
line
to
choose
is
the
one
that
will
require
more
petitions
to
be
filed
or
more...
at
least
more
laundry
list
petitions
to
be
filed
in
the
state's
highest
court.
do
you
know
what...
how
many
states
have
their
supreme
court
with
jurisdiction
no
longer
of
right,
but
only
discretionary?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
mote,
i'm
a
little
confused
about
this
question
of
just
what
is
the
right
word
because
you
said
it's
not
a
question
of
exhaustion.
there's
no
place
to
go
now,
but
it
is
a
question
of
exhaustion,
is
it
not,
because
if
you
have
no
place
to
go
now,
including
the
federal
court,
it's
because
you
did
not
take
a
step
at
the
time
you
should
have
taken
it
in
the
illinois
courts.
so,
it's
because
you
did
not
exhaust
that
last
step
in
the
illinois
state
courts
that
you
are
in
this
posture
now
in
the
federal
courts.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
it
seems
to
me
it's
just
the
same
thing
but
you're
calling
it
procedural
default;
that
is,
you
didn't
exhaust
the
remedy
that
was
there
when
you
had
it,
when
you
could
have
done
so.
therefore,
you
can't
now
because
it's
time
barred,
and
so
the
reason
that
you
can't
proceed
in
federal
court
you
say
is...
we're
calling
it
a
procedural
bar
or
something
like
that,
but
what
it
means
is
there
was
a
step
to
take
and
you
didn't
take
it
in
the
state
court
system.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
if
it
were
that,
then
you
would
prevail
because
you're
not
required
to
petition
for
cert
in
illinois.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
do
you
know
why
your
client
waited
for
10
years
after
the
direct
proceedings
had
run
their
course
before
filing
for
federal
habeas?
