does

generally
speaking,
counsel
would
not
be
provided--
justice

--for
a
prisoner
who
would
be
filing
for
discretionary

in

and
that

you
would

--should
we
make
an
exception
under
your

for
states
such

for

arizona
that

we
don't

don't

illinois
is

but
there
are
a
few
states
that
have

we

now,
maybe
we
should
make

justice

this
case
comes
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit.
the
respondent
darren
boerckel
was
convicted
in
an
illinois
trial
court
of
rape,
burglary,
and
aggravated
burglary.
he
appealed
his
convictions
to
the
illinois
appellate
court
which
affirmed.
he
then
filed
a
petition
for
leave
to
appeal
to
the
illinois
supreme
court.
that
court
denied
the
petition,
didn't
take
the
case.
later,
boerckel
filed
a
federal
habeas
petition
seeking
relief
from
his
convictions.
the
district
court
found
that
boerckel
had
procedurally
defaulted
three
of
his
claims
by
failing
to
include
them
in
his
previous
petition
for
leave
to
appeal
to
the
illinois
supreme
court.
the
seventh
circuit
court
of
appeals
reversed
and
remanded,
concluding
that
boerckel
had
not
procedurally
defaulted
those
claims
because
he
was
not
required
to
present
them
in
a
petition
for
discretionary
review
to
the
illinois
supreme
court.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
of
the
court
today,
we
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals.
federal
habeas
law
requires
state
prisoners
to
exhaust
their
state
remedies
before
they
bring
their
claims
in
federal
court.
thus,
it
gives
the
state
courts
an
opportunity
to
act
on
their
federal
claims
before
the
filing
of
a
federal
habeas
petition.
the
question
presented
here
is
a
recurring
one
in
habeas
law.
what
state
remedies
does
a
prisoner
have
to
invoke
to
satisfy
that
exhaustion
requirement?
in
this
case
we
are
asked
to
decide
whether
a
prisoner
has
to
seek
relief
in
the
illinois
supreme
court
when
that
court
has
only
discretionary
control
over
its
docket.
the
court
has
the
opportunity
to
say,
we
will
take
the
case
or
not,
just
as
this
court
exercises
discretion
over
its
docket.
so,
illinois
has
which
is
rather
typical
a
two-tiered
appellate
review
system
and
most
criminal
appeals
are
heard
by
the
intermediate
appellate
court.
any
additional
appeal
from
that
court
are
presented
to
the
illinois
supreme
court
in
a
petition
for
leave
to
appeal.
the
illinois
supreme
court
has
discretion
whether
to
take
the
case
or
not.
the
exhaustion
rule
is
codified
in
section
2254(c)
of
the
federal
habeas
statute.
it
provides
that
a
habeas
petitioner
shall
not
be
deemed
to
have
exhausted
state
court
remedies.
if
he
has
the
right
under
state
law
to
raise
by
any
available
procedure,
the
question
presented.
this
language
does
not
require
prisoners
to
invoke
clearly
fruitless
or
duplicated
procedures
in
state
courts,
but
we
hold
today
that
it
does
require
state
prisoners
to
give
state
courts
the
opportunity
to
correct
any
constitutional
errors
by
invoking
one
complete
realm
in
the
state's
established
review
procedure.
in
this
case,
that
includes
asking
the
illinois
supreme
court
for
leave
to
appeal
on
all
the
claims.
although
boerckel
had
no
right
to
review
of
his
claims
by
the
illinois
supreme
court
he
did
have
a
right
to
raise
his
claims
in
that
court.
although,
our
holding
today
has
the
potential
to
increase
the
number
of
claims
filed
in
state
supreme
courts.
we
note
that
nothing
in
the
decision
requires
the
exhaustion
of
a
specific
state
remedy
when
state
law
provides
that
the
remedy
is
unavailable.
we
hold
only
that
the
creation
of
a
discretionary
review
system
does
not
without
more,
make
review
unavailable.
