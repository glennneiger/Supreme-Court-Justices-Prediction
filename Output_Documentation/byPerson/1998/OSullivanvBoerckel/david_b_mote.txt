mr.
david
b.
mote
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i'd
like
to
initially
address
a
question
by
justice
stevens
regarding
statistics.
we
do,
in
our
brief
in
footnote
2,
provide
some
statistics
regarding
the
number
of
pla's
and
the
number
of...
petitions
for
leave
to
appeal
and
the
number
of
petitions
for
leave
to
appeal
granted.
and
in
the
most
recent
2
years
for
which
those
numbers
were
available,
the
illinois
supreme
court
granted
petitions
for
leave
to
appeal
in
approximately
3
percent
of
the
cases.
i'd
also
like
to
respond
to--
mr.
david
b.
mote
--correct.
mr.
david
b.
mote
granted?
no,
i
don't.
i'd
also
like
to
respond
to...
to
something
mr.
browers
said
regarding
three
cases,
three
illinois
cases,
that
had
reviewed
the
kind
of
claims
that
mr.
boerckel
did
not
present.
mr.
david
b.
mote
that
is
certainly--
mr.
david
b.
mote
--on
that--
mr.
david
b.
mote
--on
that,
there
is
an
illinois
opinion.
it's
an
appellate
court
opinion
that
says
that
a
decision
not
to
grant
a
petition
for
leave
to
appeal
by
the
illinois
supreme
court
is
in
no
way
a
review
of
the
merits
or
a
decision
on
the
merits.
so,
to
that
extent,
that
would
not
be
the
case.
mr.
david
b.
mote
if...
i...
i
think
that
illinois
supreme
court
rule
315
tells
us
that...
that
the
illinois
supreme
court,
like
this
court,
is
trying
to
set
itself
up
as
a
body
to
resolve
broad
questions,
and
as
in
this
court,
if...
if
a
claim
amounted
to
nothing
more
than
the
right
standard
was
applied
but
the
result
was
wrong,
there's
no
indication
in
illinois
supreme
court...
in
illinois
supreme
court
rule
315
that
the
illinois
supreme
court
wants
to
hear
that
kind
of
a
claim.
mr.
david
b.
mote
i
think
that
what
that...
what
that
would
cover
is...
is
allowing...
i
think
it
has
been
applied
in
cases
involving
allowing
misconduct
and
in
some...
but
that...
that
is
the
most
general
provision--
mr.
david
b.
mote
--that...
that's
fair
to
say.
mr.
david
b.
mote
numerically
i
have
not
looked
at
all
the
cases.
i...
i
have
looked
at
the
three
cases
that
mr.
browers
cited,
and
i
think
a
close
reading
of
those
cases
or
even
a
cursory
reading
shows
that
they
did
not
resolve
the
fact-specific
questions
that
it
would
appear
from
the
illinois
attorney
general's
summary
they
resolved.
for
example,
in
people
v.
tulate,
which
is
the
case
they
cite
saying
the
illinois
supreme
court
has
resolved
a
sufficiency
of
the
evidence
question,
what
the
question
was,
was
whether
a...
a
conviction
for
burglary
to...
a
burglary
with
intent
to
commit
rape
could
stand
based
on
no
evidence
of
intent
to
commit
sexual
assault.
and
what
they
said
is
that
while
illinois
cases
had
recognized
that
an
intent
to
commit
a
theft
could
be
inferred
from
a
breaking
and
entering,
you
couldn't
infer
from
just
the
breaking
and
entering
the
intent
to
commit
rape
or
any
other
felony.
so,
that
was
just
a
broad
question
of
law.
it
wasn't
a
normal
sufficiency--
mr.
david
b.
mote
--yes,
i
do.
and...
and
i
have
not...
i
have
not
done
a...
tried
to
do
a
comprehensive
review
of
the
cases
decided
by
the
illinois
supreme
court,
but
of
the
three
cases
they
chose
to
cite,
they
are
all
upon
review
decisions
on
broad
legal
questions
and
not
fact-specific
decisions.
mr.
david
b.
mote
no,
i
don't...
i
don't
think
this
court
should
adopt
a
rule
where...
where
they
look
at
it
and
try
to
determine
the
likelihood
of...
of
success
a
particular
petition
would...
would
have.
i
think
that
would...
that
would
be
very
subjective
and...
and
put
the
federal
habeas
court
in
the
position
of
trying
to
guess
what
a
state
supreme
court
would
have
done
on
cert.
and
that...
that
would
be
a
very
difficult
thing
for
the
habeas
court
to...
to
decide.
i
do
think
in...
in
response
to...
to
a
question
of
yours,
mr.
chief
justice,
about
the
fact
that
this
has
never
been
presented
before,
it
should
be
pointed
out
that
what
the...
what
the
illinois
attorney
general
is
doing
is
asking
this
court
to
take
a
footnote
out
of
coleman
v.
thompson
and
essentially
not
over...
not
only
override
the
rule
adopted
by
the
illinois
supreme
court,
which
has
the
authority
to
make
that
rule
under
both
the
illinois
constitution
and
illinois
statute,
but
also
effectively
the
illinois
attorney
general
asked
this
court
to
overturn
a
slew
of
this
court's
prior
decisions.
this
court--
mr.
david
b.
mote
--yes.
in
the
sense
that
the...
that
the
illinois
supreme
court,
while
it
says
this
is
not
an
exclusive
list
of
the
factors
they'll
consider,
there's
no
purpose
in
having
the
rule
if
it's
not
intended
to
give
guidance
to
the
litigants.
and
it's
understandable
that
the
illinois
supreme
court,
like
this
court,
reserves
to
itself
a...
a
certain
amount
of
discretion
in
deciding
what
it
will
review,
but
certainly
the
rule
is
not
there
to
invite
litigants
to
disregard
it.
mr.
david
b.
mote
i've
not
contended
for
a
specific
rule
in
this
case,
but
i
see
the
court
as
having
two
alternatives.
one,
in
this
case,
it
would
be
sufficient
to
decide
this
case
to
say
that
where
the
prisoners...
where
the
prisoner
has
complied
with
the
rule
enunciated
by
the
state
and
presented
to
the
state
the
claims
that
meet
the
factors
enunciated
in
the
state
rules,
that
he
has
not
waived
claims
that
did
not
fall
under
those
factors.
mr.
david
b.
mote
the
federal
habeas
courts
are
already
required
to
look
at
what
state
law
requires
and
they
have
some
familiarity
with
that.
but
at
the
same
time,
if
this
court
wanted
to
enunciate
a
national
rule,
it
would...
it
would...
it
would
be
easier
to
administer
a
rule
that
said
that
if
the
state
has
adopted
a
system
of
discretionary
supreme
court
review,
then
the
claims
need
not
be
presented
to
the
state
supreme
court.
mr.
david
b.
mote
that...
that
would
be--
mr.
david
b.
mote
--correct.
correct.
that...
that
absolute
rule
would
be
as
easy
to
apply,
but
it
would
offend
a
comity
and
federalism
to
say
that
the
federal
courts
are
going
to
require
prisoners
to
present
all
their
claims
to
the
state
supreme
courts
regardless
of
what
the
state
supreme
courts
enunciate
as
their
role.
mr.
david
b.
mote
well--
mr.
david
b.
mote
--that's
true,
your
honor,
but
hopefully
this
is
not
something
that
congress
will
have
to
decide.
one...
one
key
point
in
all
of
this
is
that
the
state
gets
to
make
the
rules,
and
if
the
state
says
under...
under
a
policy
that
you
don't
have
to
present
it
to...
to
a
court
that
has
not
given
you
a
right
to
have
your
claim
heard,
we
don't
think
we're
getting
to
look
at
enough
of
these
cases,
they
can
change
their
rule.
mr.
david
b.
mote
well,
in
illinois--
mr.
david
b.
mote
--they...
they
can...
well...
and
i
can't
give
you
exact
numbers.
the
breakdown
between
states
that
have
what
is
referred
to
as
a
mandatory
system
of
review
where
you
have
a
right
to
present
your
claims
to
the
state
supreme
court
and
the
courts
where
it's
discretion...
the
states
with
discretionary
review,
it's
about
an
even
split.
there's
about
20
and
20,
and
then
there
are
states
that
have
a
mixed
system.
mr.
david
b.
mote
if--
mr.
david
b.
mote
--well--
mr.
david
b.
mote
--and...
and
that...
that
just
points
out
the...
the
reality,
which
is
any
big
state
does
not
want
to
look
at
every
claim
from
every
prisoner.
they...
they
don't
have
the
capacity
to
do
it.
but
what
we're
saying
is
that
the
rule
adopted
by
the
states
should
be
respected,
and--
mr.
david
b.
mote
--the...
the
illinois
supreme
court
i...
i
believe
gets
about
half
the
number
of
cases
a
year
as
this
court
does,
about
3,500.
mr.
david
b.
mote
not
that
i'm
aware
of.
mr.
david
b.
mote
no.
but
that...
that
brings
up,
justice
stevens,
a...
a
good
point,
which
is
that
this
court
has...
has
on
numerous
occasions
said
that
the
any
available
remedy
language
doesn't
include,
as
mr.
browers
has
put
it,
redundant
actions.
it
doesn't...
and
it
doesn't
include,
as
this
court
stated
in...
in
wilworth
v....
wilwording
v.
swenson,
actions
where
it
is
conjectural
if
the
state
would
agree
to
hear
the
claim.
mr.
david
b.
mote
exactly.
mr.
david
b.
mote
and...
and,
justice
stevens,
under
this
court's
precedent,
it
clearly
does
not
because
this
court
has
repeatedly
said
that
procedural
default
occurs
when
a
state
prisoner
does
not
comply
with
a
firmly
established
and
regularly
followed
state
practice.
mr.
boerckel
tried
to
comply
with
illinois
supreme
court
rule
315.
mr.
david
b.
mote
in
administrative
law?
i'm
not
sure,
your
honor.
mr.
david
b.
mote
your
honor,
a
better
analogy--
mr.
david
b.
mote
--well,
this
court
has
previously
held
that
exhaustion
within
the
terms
of
this
statute
refers
to
whether
or
not
there...
there
are
available
remedies
left
at
the
time
the
federal
habeas
petition
is
followed.
and
that
is
one
of
the
line
of
cases
that
the
illinois
attorney
general's
position
would
require
essentially
overturning.
i
would
also
point
out
that
this
court
has
held
that
in
order
to--
mr.
david
b.
mote
--the...
the
cases
from
this
court
that
have
said
that
exhaustion
within...
as
it's
used
in...
let
me
rephrase
that.
this
court
has
previously
stated
that
the
term
any
available
state
remedies
within
2254
refers
to
whether
there
are
any
available
state
remedies
at
the
time
that
the
federal
habeas
petition
is
filed.
and
as
justice
stevens
said,
there's
no
question
that--
mr.
david
b.
mote
--that
there's
nowhere
to
go
at
this
point.
mr.
david
b.
mote
yes,
your
honor.
it
is...
it
is
discussed
in
engle
v.
isaac
at
footnote
28,
which
was
referred
to
by
mr....
mr.
browers.
it's
also
referred
to
in...
in
coleman
v.
thompson
and
fay
v.
noia.
mr.
david
b.
mote
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
david
b.
mote
your
honor,
i...
i
would
point
out
that
in...
in
the
habeas
context,
this
court
has
previously
held
that
it's
not
necessary
to
ask
this
court
for
certiorari
enable
to...
in
order
to
preserve
issues
for
federal
habeas
review.
and
this
court
has
stated
that...
in
coleman
v.
thompson
that
the
state's
procedural
rules
are
entitled
to
the
same
respect
as
federal
procedural
rules.
given
that
and
given
the
fact
that,
as
we
stated
in
our...
our
brief,
the
illinois
supreme
court
has
recognized
that
its
petition
for
leave
to
appeal
practice
is
similar
to
this
court's
certiorari
practice.
the
effect
of
not
asking
for
that
discretionary
review,
particularly
when
you're
talking
about
just
not
asking
on
claims
based
on
the
guidance
given
in
the
rule...
the
effect
should
be
the
same
if
we
give
the
state
procedural
rule
the
same
respect
we
give
the
federal
procedural
rule.
mr.
david
b.
mote
there...
there
is
certainly
a...
a
connection
between
the
two.
procedural
default
comes
about
if
one
doesn't...
doesn't
comply
with
a
practice
that's
firmly
established
by
the
state
courts.
and
what
that
will
mean
at
some
point
is
that
there
was
something
that
wasn't
exhausted,
but
as
justice
stevens
stated,
under
the...
the
way
this
court
has
defined
exhaustion,
when
the
time
to
pursue
that
possible
avenue
has
run,
then
it
becomes
exhausted
because
exhaustion
talks
about
merely
the
fact
that
it's
no
longer
available.
mr.
david
b.
mote
there's
a
distinction,
your
honor.
procedural
default
means
not
just
that
there
was
a
step
that
you
could
have
taken
that
you
didn't
take.
it
means
that
there
was
a
step
that
you
were
required
take
and
didn't
take.
mr.
david
b.
mote
correct,
your
honor.
and
that...
and
that's
exactly
our
position.
mr.
david
b.
mote
i
do,
your
honor.
it's
not
in
the
record.
it's
not
in
the
record
explicitly
anyway.
but
the
record
does
reflect
that
mr.
boerckel
has
an
iq
of
70
and
the
state
appellate
decision
reflects
that
at
the
time
of
his
conviction,
his...
his
reading
level
was
grade
1
and
a
half.
the
initial
habeas
petition
that...
that
was
filed
was
written
by
a
cell
mate
of
his,
and
it
just
happened
to
be
that
period
of
time
before
he
understood
and
had
the
help
to
do
it.
certainly
most
state
prisoners
would
have
become
aware
of
that
option
and...
and
been
able
to
do
something
with
it
much
earlier.
in...
in
terms
of...
of
the
decisions
of
this
court
that
the
state's
position
route
effectively
require
be
overruled,
there
are
the
cases
that
draw
the
distinction
between
exhaustion
and
default.
that
includes
coleman
v.
thompson,
engle
v.
isaac,
wainwright
v.
sykes,
and
fay
v.
noia.
there's
also
the
cases
i
mentioned
before,
saying
that
the
right
to
raise
by
any
available
means,
talks
about
whether
you
have
the
right
to
raise
by
any
available
means
at
the
time
the
federal
petition
is...
is
filed,
and
that
includes
some
of
the
same
cases.
mr.
david
b.
mote
that...
what
happens
is
the
failure
to
exhaust,
when
the
time
that
you
could
take
that
step
runs,
ripens
into
a
procedural
default.
mr.
david
b.
mote
exactly,
mr.
chief
justice.
and...
and
this...
this
court
has
said
that
procedural
default,
as
i
said,
requires
violation
of
a
firmly
established
and
regularly
followed
state
procedure.
the
court
said
that
in
ulster
county
v.
allen,
james
v.
kentucky,
teague
v.
lane,
and
more
recently
coleman
v.
thompson.
mr.
david
b.
mote
my
response
would
be
that
illinois
and
any
other
state
can
define,
through
its
rules,
the
claims
and
the
types
of
claims
that
a...
a
prisoner
is
allowed
or
required
to
present.
mr.
david
b.
mote
in
the--
mr.
david
b.
mote
--sure.
they
don't
have
to
do
it
across
the
board.
just
as
on
discretionary
review,
illinois
and...
and
most
of
the
other
states
that
have
adopted
discretionary
review
have
given
some
guidance,
you
could...
a
state
could...
could
say--
mr.
david
b.
mote
--you
have
the
right
to
have
the
following
kinds
of
claims
heard.
mr.
browers--
mr.
david
b.
mote
--if
it
is...
if
it
is
truly
just
a...
a
state
law
issue--
mr.
david
b.
mote
--the
illinois
supreme
court
is
normally
a
prisoner's
last
chance
to
have
that
heard.
and
it
should
be
kept
in
mind
that
the
prisoner
has
no...
no
incentive
to
bypass
the
illinois
supreme
court.
as...
as
the
seventh
circuit
said,
that
would...
that
would
assume
a
very
risk-prone
group
of
prisoners.
it's
another
chance
for...
for
the
prisoner
to
get
relief.
mr.
browers
suggested
that
if
a
claim
is
important
enough
to
raise
in
a
federal
habeas,
it's
important
enough
to
present
to
the
state
supreme
court.
i
think
that...
that
whole
viewpoint
is
incorrect
because
the
mere
fact
that
there's
an
alleged
constitutional
violation,
while
it's
very
important
to
the
prisoner,
doesn't
mean
it's
important
in
a
broader
sense,
that...
that
the
claim
in
that
particular
case,
particularly
a
fact-specific
claim,
be
resolved.
but
if
a
state
supreme
court
wants
to
be...
wants
the
first
chance
to
review
everything
that
will
end
up
in
federal
habeas
corpus,
they
could
have
a
rule
that
says
that
you
have
a
right
and
to
exhaust
your
remedies
must
present
to
the
illinois
supreme
court
those
claims.
mr.
david
b.
mote
your
honor,
it's...
i
was...
i
was
intending
it...
and
i
see
i'm
out
of
time.
may
i
finish
my
answer
on
that?
mr.
david
b.
mote
thank
you.
