would
you
say
that
there...
there's
no
evidence
that
the
illinois
supreme
court
affirmatively
discourages
prisoners
from
seeking
discretionary
review?

take

take
it
most
attorneys
prefer
two
bites
at
the

it's
fair
to
say,
isn't
it,
that
there's
nothing
either
in
the
rule
or
in
the
written
opinions
of
the
court
where
the
court
has
ever
said
that
claims
such
as
these
should
not
be
submitted
to
it?
