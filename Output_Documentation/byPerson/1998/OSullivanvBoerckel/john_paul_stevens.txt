justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
on
that
point?
it
seemed
to
me
there's
a
conceivably
kind
of
a
conflict
of
interest
within
the...
within
the
state
of
illinois.
i
can
see
why
your
office
would
want
complete
exhaustion
right
down
the
line.
but
it
seemed
to
me
if
i
were
a
judge
of
that
court,
i
might
not
welcome
a
rule
that
would
require
that
there
be
a
great
many
more
petitions
for
leave
to
appeal
filed
if
in
fact...
i
don't
know
if
this
is
true...
about
95
percent
of
them
are
denied
anyway.
and
your
rule
will
require
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
to
do
more
work
than
your
opponent's
rule.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
surely
if
everybody
has
to
file...
go
to
the
supreme
court
of
illinois,
more...
more
people
would
go
than
if
they
don't
have
to
file.
isn't
that
fairly
clear?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
no.
i'm
sure
they
weren't.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
that
almost
makes
the
point
even
more
clear.
it
would
mean
that
in
every
petition
they've
got
to
cover...
file,
you
know,
all
17
issues
they
can
think
of
to
be
sure
they
don't
miss
one.
whereas,
often
an
advocate
thinks
he's
better
off
to
limit
a
petition
for
review
to
this
court,
for
example,
to
1
or
2
questions
instead
of
19
errors.
but
i
think
your
rule
would
result
in
petitions
including
more
issues
and
also
in
more
petitions,
which
i
wonder
if
the
illinois
supreme
court
would
welcome
as
much
as
you...
you
would.
i
understand
the
reason
the...
that
your
office
would.
justice
john
paul
stevens
that's
3
percent
of
criminal
cases.
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
know
what
the
percentage
is
across
the
board?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
a
question
about
illinois
procedure?
does
the
illinois
supreme
court
allow
petitions
for
rehearing
from
denials
of
petitions
for
leave
to
appeal?
justice
john
paul
stevens
there's
no
rule
providing
for
that.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
but
this
case,
of
course...
we're
not...
this
is
not
an
exhaustion
case.
this
is
a
procedural
bar
case,
as
i
understand
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
there
really
isn't
any
question
that
the
language
of
the
statute
is
complied
with
if
the
litigant
allows
the
time
to...
for
leave
to
appeal
to
run.
at
that
point
there
is
no
available
remedy
under
state
law.
so,
he's
exhausted.
but
the
question
is
whether
that
omission
bars
him
from
proceeding
in
federal
habeas
under
coleman
against
thompson,
or
whatever
the
name
of
it
is.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
i
think
moore
against
dempsey
too.
justice
john
paul
stevens
does
the
federal
court
have
the
jurisdiction
to
decide
the
state
law
issue
as
a
basis
for...
relief--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--it
would
be--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--i'm
not
entirely
clear
on
why
you're
making
this
argument
because
the
issue
isn't
exhaustion.
the
issue
is
procedural
default,
and
i
don't
see
how
the
illinois
supreme
court
can
tell
us
whether
there's
been
a
procedural
default
or
not.
i
mean,
it
seems
to
me
they...
they
could
say
whatever
they
want
to,
and
we
could
adopt
either
a
rule
that
you
must
exhaust
discretionary
right
or
you
don't
have
to.
it's
up
to
us
to
decide
that.
or
we
could
even
say
you
don't
have
to
go
to
the...
we
could
even
say
there's
no
procedural
default
if
you've
appealed
to
the
intermediate
court
but
you...
and
you
had
a
right
to
appeal
to
the
supreme
court.
there's
nothing...
the
exhaustion
rule
wouldn't
prevent
us
from
saying
that's
not
a
procedural
default
as
long
as
you
had
the
opportunity
to...
for
review
in
the
trial
court
and
the
intermediate
appellate
court.
i'm
not
suggesting
we're
going
to
do
that,
but
i
think
it's
very
important
to
keep
in
mind
the
difference
between
the
exhaustion
rule
and
the
waiver
rule.
and
i'm...
i
think
your
argument
is
directed
at
exhaustion.
