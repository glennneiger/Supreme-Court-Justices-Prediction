how...
how
do
they
change
their
rule?
unknown
speaker
to
say
what?
that--
unknown
speaker
it's
a
term
we
use
all
the
time,
and
i
think
if
you
have
a
case
in
the
social
security
system,
for
example,
and
the
last...
the
last
review
is
discretionary
by
the
board,
i
doubt
whether
we
would
allow
the
litigant
to
come
into
federal
district
court
where
the...
the
litigant
did
not
first
seek
to
get
the
agency
to
correct
its...
its
mistake,
even
if...
even
if
it
was
a
discretionary
level.
