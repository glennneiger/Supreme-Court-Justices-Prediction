unknown
speaker
but
there
are
exceptions
to
that
rule,
are
there
not,
mr.
goldstein?
unknown
speaker
mr.
goldstein,
you
have
recognized
that,
if
the
client
had
been
sanctioned
as
well,
the
client
would
have
to
wait
till
the
end
of
the
line
and
presumably
the
lawyer,
too,
and
the
lawyer,
although
not
a
party,
could
then
appeal,
so
that
seems
to
be
inconsistent
with
your
position.
unknown
speaker
but
we
have
a
nonparty,
the
attorney,
who
could
take
an
appeal
then,
so
the
chief
asked
if
that
rule
is
without
exception.
one
exception
would
be
this
very
situation
if
the
client
were
sanctioned
along
with
the
lawyer.
unknown
speaker
if
you're
wrong
about
the
possibility
of
the
attorney
appealing
the
sanction
at
the
end
of
the
line,
if
you're
wrong
about
that,
then
i
take
it
you
concede
that
you
could
not
prevail
here.
unknown
speaker
before
we
get
to
those,
i'm
sort
of
perplexed
by
the
inconsistency
at
the
other
end.
why
is
it
that
an
attorney
would
not
be
a
party
for
purposes
of
appealing
immediately--
unknown
speaker
--but...
i
mean,
would
be
a
party,
treated
like
a
party
for
purposes
of
appealing
immediately,
but
would
not
be
a
party
for
purposes
of
appealing
at
the
end
of
the
case?
i
mean,
i
don't
see
why,
conceptually,
that
makes
any
sense.
unknown
speaker
well,
so
you're
saying
she
could
appeal
the...
on
the
basis
of
the
order,
in...
but
she
couldn't
appeal
from
the
final
judgment.
that
seems
a
very
strange
result.
unknown
speaker
but
she's
not
appealing
the
final
judgment.
the
final
judgment
is
simply
what
we
refer
to
to
determine
when
she
may
appeal.
she's
still
appealing
the
order,
whether
she
appeals
it
immediately
or
later.
unknown
speaker
mr.
goldstein,
there
are
all
kinds
of
orders
that
are
made
in
the
course
of
a
trial
proceeding,
orders
that
are
not
immediately
reviewable,
and
you
don't
lose
out
because
of
the
30-day
limit.
i
think
that
that
applies
to
a
final
order,
not
to
an
interlocutory
order.
unknown
speaker
well,
if
the
court
should
decide
that
no
such
line
was
ever
drawn
and
that
it
would
make
no
sense
to
draw
it,
that
is,
the
judgment
is
the
occasion,
as
justice
scalia
said,
it
answers
the
when
question.
you
can
appeal
it
then.
the
attorney
isn't
seeking
to
reverse
the
judgment
against
the
client,
but
is
seeking
to
review
an
order
that
was
made
along
the
way.
so
you
were
beginning
to
tell
us
that
even
if
it's
right
that
this
would
be
appealable
at
the
end
of
the
line,
still,
you
said,
it
could
be
appealed
earlier
because--
unknown
speaker
--well,
in
this
case
it
was
stayed.
the
order
was
stayed,
was
it
not?
unknown
speaker
does
that
mean
that
the
order
could
not
be
stayed,
in
your
view?
unknown
speaker
well
then,
that
takes
some
of
the
injury
out
of
it.
unknown
speaker
well,
that
isn't
staying
the
order,
that's
not
entering
the
order
until
later.
it
seems
to
me
you
can
never
stay
an
order.
you
stay
the
consequences
of
the
order.
you
stay
the
effect
that
the
order
provides,
so
you're
not
talking
about
staying
the
order.
it
seems
to
me
this
order
was
stayed
as
completely
as
any
order
is
ever
stayed.
its
effect
was
suspended
until
the
end
of
the
trial.
unknown
speaker
is
there
any
reason...
i
mean,
assuming
that
the
language
is
open
to
your
interpretation
or
the
other,
which
i'll
assume
for
the
moment,
is
there
any
good
reason
why
we
should
make
this
so
complicated?
i
mean,
shouldn't...
isn't
the
simple...
courts
of
appeals
have
a
lot
to
do,
and
if
we
take
the
other
position,
we're
sure
they're
not
going
to
get
into
this
business
of
trying
to
mix
the,
is
it
part
of
the
merits,
isn't
it
part
of
the
merits,
et
cetera.
it's
a
single
rule
for
everybody,
and
is
any
harm
done?
unknown
speaker
or
the
clear,
single
would
be,
you'd
lose,
because
the
clear,
single
rule
would
be,
everybody...
if
you're
sanctioned,
the
time
to
appeal
the
sanction
order,
just
like
an
attorney
who
is
still
in
the
case,
the
attorney
who
isn't
appeals
it
at
the
end
of
the
case,
and
if
you
don't
like
the
order
in
the
meantime,
ask
for
a
stay,
and
if
he
won't
give
you
a
stay,
go
under
rule
8,
get
the
court
of
appeals
to
do
it.
unknown
speaker
oh,
well,
why
wouldn't
it
give
rise
to
the
problem
of,
in
many
sanctions
cases,
when
they
get
to
the
court
of
appeals
it
would
be
mixed
up
with
the
merits,
and
all
of
a
sudden
you
discover
that
this
attorney
was
sanctioned
for
bringing
a
frivolous
this
or
that,
and
the
court
of
appeals,
the
parties
will
think,
my
god,
we'd
better
be
up
there
arguing
about
this,
because
it
has
to
do
with
the
merits
of
the
case.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
suppose
on
that
point,
in
a
serious
case,
could
you
get
a
writ
of
mandate?
unknown
speaker
i
mean,
it's
a
million
dollar
fine,
and
the
judge
refuses
to
stay
it.
could
you
go
to
the
court
of...
let's
assume
that
you
had
to
wait
till
the
end
of
the...
could
you
get
a
writ
of
mandate?
unknown
speaker
i'm
sorry,
why
can't...
i
would
think
this
would
be
an
odd
case
that
it
would
ever
happen
that
if
a
lawyer
is
sanctioned
in
the
middle
of
the
case,
and
the
lawyer
withdraws,
so
that
he's
not
still
representing
the
party,
and
you
say,
judge,
i
want
to
appeal,
i
can't
appeal
to
the
end,
would
you
mind
staying
the
payment
until
the
end
of
the
case,
and
the
judge
would
say
no.
i
can't
believe
a
judge
would
do
that,
but
if
the
judge
did
say
no,
you
would
go
to
the
court
of
appeals
and
ask
them
for
a
stay.
is
there
any
problem
with
that?
unknown
speaker
where
does
it
say
that
rule
8,
to
get
a
stay,
you
have
to
have
filed
a
notice
of
appeal?
i
didn't
see--
--you
don't
have
jurisdiction...
the
court
of
appeals
doesn't
have
jurisdiction
if--
--to
protect
itself.
that's
my
question,
because
that's
what
i
wondered.
unknown
speaker
mr.
goldstein,
when
justice
breyer
asked
you,
you
could
read
it
one
way,
you
could
read
it
the
other
way,
why
shouldn't
the
tie
breaker
be
1292(e)?
the
congress
said,
courts,
this
is
the
kind
of
thing
you
ought
to
sort
out
by
rule
making.
you
want
to
make
more
things
final,
court,
you
can
do
that
through
the
rule
making
process.
given
that
signal
from
congress,
why
should
we
do
anything
by
adjudication
to
add
to
the
list
of
interlocutory
orders
that
are
immediately
appealable?
unknown
speaker
what
is
the...
i
mean,
you're
being
very
picky
about,
you
know,
rule
4,
rule
8
and
so
forth.
what
is
the
textual
authority
for
any
interlocutory
appeal?
unknown
speaker
it's
a
judicial
elaboration
in
cohen
upon
the
term,
final
order.
unknown
speaker
final
decision,
excuse
me.
unknown
speaker
well,
if
it's
just
a
matter
of
practicality,
i
mean,
we're
making
it
up
under
cohen,
essentially.
we
say,
some
things
are
final
decisions,
and
other
things
aren't
final
decisions,
and
we
feel
free
to
use
the
cohen
factors,
some
of
which
have
very
little
to
do
with
finality.
they
have
to
do
with
practicality.
so
why
not
take
those
same
practical
considerations
into
account
in
the
present
instance?
unknown
speaker
why
didn't
she
try?
one
of
the
striking
things
about
the
facts
of
this
case
is
that
no
protective
appeal
was
taken
once
there
was
a
final
judgment.
that
was
just
allowed
to
happen.
unknown
speaker
well,
what
did
she
have
to
lose,
because
it
seems
that
would
put
her
in
the
best
position?
unknown
speaker
where?
what
kind
of
trouble?
unknown
speaker
you
are
envisioning
that
the
court
of
appeals,
when
someone
is
in
this
bind,
says
the
law
is
uncertain,
so
i
filed
a
notice
of
appeal
at
the
interlocutory
stage,
i
filed
one
at
the
end
of
the
line,
a
court
of
appeals
would
sanction
a
lawyer
for
doing
that?
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
in...
picking
up
on
your
last
colloquy
with
justice
scalia,
do
you
acknowledge
that
this
is
a
cohen
problem
at
all?
cohen
orders
usually
refer
to
parties.
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask,
when
you
talk
about
the
closest
analogue,
is
there
anything
we
can
learn
from
the
procedure
when
a
lawyer
is
actually
held
in
contempt,
as
opposed
to
just
sanctions?
when
do
you
appeal
then,
and
so
forth?
unknown
speaker
and
is
it
true
that
the
contempt
cases
we've
reviewed
have
been
reviewed
on
the
interlocutory
stage,
rather
than
after
the
final
judgment?
unknown
speaker
but
isn't
an
attorney
given
considerably
more
procedural
rights
in
the
case
of
a
citation
for
contempt
than
for
a
sanction?
unknown
speaker
well,
that
would
be
a
pretty
risky
thing
for
an
attorney.
i'm
not
really
worried
about
an
attorney--
--yes,
that's
hardly
a
motivation,
to
say
that,
you
know,
yes,
you're
in
bad
shape
now--
--right.
right.
--but
if
you
just
get
yourself
held
in
contempt,
you'll
be
okay.
[laughter]
i
mean,
i
suppose
he
might
commit
suicide,
too,
but
i'm
not
really
worried
about
it.
unknown
speaker
mr.
goldstein,
can
i
ask
you,
if
you
say
that
cohen
is
really
not
implicated
here,
then
there
really
is
no
way
to
handle
the
case
where
you
have
an
interlocutory
appeal
and
it
is
intimately
bound
up
with
the
merits
of
the
case,
that
really
whether
there
was
a
sanctionable
conduct
or
not
depends
entirely
upon
how
you
view
the
merits
of
the
case,
which
seems
to
me
not
at
all
an
unusual
situation.
what
do
you
do
in
that
case?
unknown
speaker
since
we're
not
applying
cohen
you
can't
say,
well,
although
most
of
these
things
would
be
interlocutory,
this
one
won't
be.
we'll
have...
you'll
have
to
do
this
at
the
end
of
the
whole
proceeding.
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
the
ones
i've
actually
seen,
where
we
had
appeals,
they...
the
argument
would
be
that
the
attorney,
for
example,
asked
too
many
questions
or
something
in
a
deposition,
way
out
of
line,
and
the
defense
would
be
something
like,
well,
if
you
really
understood
this
case
you'd
understand
that
these
questions
aren't
out
of
line.
if
you
really
understood
this
case,
you'd
see
that
my
delay
was
reasonable.
and
then
they'd
start
arguing
about,
what's
this
case
really
about,
and
at
that
point,
if
i
were
a
client,
i'd
say...
i'd
want
to
be
in
there,
you
know,
before
the
court
of
appeals
takes
a
view
of
this.
i
mean,
that's
the
kind
of
thing
i'm
concerned
about,
and
i
guess
that's
the
kind
of
thing
that's
led
the
lower
courts
not
to
allow
appeals
in
cases
where
the
attorney's
in
there
and
hasn't
been
dismissed,
and
a
lot
of
other
instances.
that's
what's
worrying
me.
unknown
speaker
are
there
instances,
in
your
experience,
where
there
are
repeated
multiple
sanctions
put
on
an
attorney,
an
attorney
is
just
really
being
obstreperous?
unknown
speaker
he's
fined
$50
on
1
january,
$500
on
the
1
february
for
something
else?
unknown
speaker
and
you
obviously
know
where
i'm
going,
if
there
are
multiple
appeals.
unknown
speaker
but
each
time
the
court
of
appeals
shoots
them
down
it's
another
piece
of
appellate
business
that
really
is
contrary
to
the
policy
against
piecemeal
appeals.
unknown
speaker
so
is
a
disqualification
order,
and
why
isn't
that
the
closer
analogy
than
a
contempt
citation?
unknown
speaker
very
well,
mr.
goldstein.
mr.
arnold,
we'll
hear
from
you.
unknown
speaker
well,
this
attorney
was
also
removed
from
the
case,
so
is
no
longer
acting
as
attorney,
right?
unknown
speaker
that
might
make
a
difference.
do...
does
cohen
apply?
should
we
assume
that
cohen
applies
to
this--
unknown
speaker
--when
it's
a
nonparty?
unknown
speaker
oh,
no,
once
the
attorney
is
removed,
it
makes
the
person
much
more
of
a
nonparty
than
when
the
attorney
is
still
in
there
representing
the
client.
unknown
speaker
why
would
mooting
of
the
case
affect
it?
unknown
speaker
the
case
might
moot
out
later,
but
the
basis
for
the
attorney
sanction
would
not
be
eliminated
by
the
mooting
of
the
case
on
the
merits,
would
it?
unknown
speaker
you
weren't
saying
that
mooting
of
the
case
by
some
later
event
necessarily
moots
the
attorney
sanction
issue
that
arose
before
it.
unknown
speaker
okay.
you're
saying
whatever
is
the
end
of
the
line,
if
the
case
is
settled,
there's
an
order
dismissing
the
case,
is
that
what
you're
saying?
because
mr.
goldstein
brought
up
the
possibility,
well,
the
case
could
settle,
and
then
there
would
be
never
a
time
that
this
could
be
appealed.
unknown
speaker
but
there
would
be
no
notice
given,
presumably,
to
an
attorney
who
had
been
removed
in
the
interim.
that
attorney
would
not
get
notice
of
any
final
disposition,
presumably.
unknown
speaker
why
isn't
the
contempt
sanction
the
closest
analogy?
i
mean,
the
magistrate
who
imposed
the
rule
37
fine
could
have
used
this
contempt
sanction.
unknown
speaker
well,
there's
a
lot
of
cases
where
the
lawyers
are
held
in
contempt.
i've
been
in
court
when
lawyers
have
been
held
in
contempt
and
the
case
came
all
the
way
to
this
court.
there
are
a
lot
of
those
cases.
but
why...
regardless
of
the
number,
why
should
they
be
treated
differently?
that's
the
real
question.
unknown
speaker
well,
my
question
is,
why
shouldn't
it
be
treated
like
contempt,
which
is
sometimes
used
as
a
way
of
getting
interlocutory
review
of
a
discovery
order?
i
mean,
isn't
that
true
of
the
famous
hickman
v.
taylor?
a
lawyer
was
held
in
contempt,
and
that's
how
it
got
up
on
appeal.
unknown
speaker
you
say
a
contempt
might
not
be
appealable
until
the
end?
unknown
speaker
why...
i'm
sorry,
i
haven't
followed
you.
why
is
it
that
you
say
a
contempt
citation
is
different
from
just
a
sanction?
unknown
speaker
well,
that's
true,
but--
unknown
speaker
--well,
let's
say...
i'm
talking
about
contempt
citation
of
an
attorney.
now,
do
you
acknowledge
that
that's
appealable
immediately?
unknown
speaker
not
in
every
case?
unknown
speaker
what
cases
would
it
not
be?
unknown
speaker
what
is
this
case,
the
case
that
you're
relying
on?
unknown
speaker
but
i
thought
in
all
of
the...
at
least
all
the
contempt
cases
i
know,
taking
hickman
v.
taylor,
the
lawyer's
interest
was...
he
was
serving
his
client.
he
was
totally
serving
his
client,
and
yet
we
took
that
case,
and
it
was
the
great
case
about
the
scope
of
discovery.
unknown
speaker
now
you're
arguing
that
we
should
not
allow
interlocutory
appeals
of
contempt
citations.
unknown
speaker
and
i'm
inclined
to
agree
with
you,
that
if
we
agree
with
you
we
shouldn't
allow
interlocutory
appeals
of
contempt
citations.
is
that
your
position?
unknown
speaker
well,
frequently,
and
i
think
this
court
has
admonished
trial
judges
that
if
you're
thinking
of
holding
a
lawyer
in
contempt,
either
tell
him
that
you're
thinking
about
it,
but
wait
awhile.
in
other
words,
don't
simply
cite
him
from
the
bench,
but
hold
off
for
a
while,
and
maybe
do
what
judge
medina
did
in
the
communist
case,
have
a
hearing
at
the
end
of
the
trial,
and
of
course
that
would
remove
the
appealability
problem
there,
since
surely
a
contempt
citation
with
a
fine
at
the
end
of
the
trial
would
be
appealable.
unknown
speaker
well,
what
discretion
does
a
trial
judge
have
to
defer
the
effectiveness
of
an
order
of
sanction,
or
to
defer...
what
discretion
would
a
court
of
appeals
have
to
defer
holding
any
hearings
on
it
until
the
end
of
the
case?
unknown
speaker
uh
huh.
unknown
speaker
stay
the
collection
of
it?
unknown
speaker
they
would
stay...
would
have
power
to
stay
the
collection
of
the
sanction
until
the
end.
unknown
speaker
but
would
it
be,
do
you
think,
would
the
notice
of
appeal
have
to
be
filed
in
30
days
of
the
entry
of
the
order
that
you
are
sanctioned?
unknown
speaker
well,
is
the
best
resolution
of
this
to
leave
it
to
the
discretion
of
the
court--
unknown
speaker
--imposing
the
sanction?
unknown
speaker
should
the
best
resolution
of
this
problem
be
to
leave
the
effectiveness
of
it
in
the
discretion
of
the
trial
judge?
unknown
speaker
the
problem
is,
is
that
these
sanction
orders
are
sometimes
entered
by
the
court
when
its
patience
has
run
out,
the
court
is
angry
at
the
attorney,
sometimes
for
a
good
cause,
sometimes
not,
and
there's
a
real
danger
that
the
district
judges
can
overstep
and
require
an
attorney
to
come
forward
with
a
substantial
sum
of
money
for
a
sanction,
and
that
just
seems
to
me
to
be
a
very
harsh
rule,
especially
in
this
case,
where
the
attorney
is
out
of
the
case.
unknown
speaker
well,
it
can
go
beyond
financial
hardship,
it
seems
to
me.
justice
ginsburg's
question
raises
this
doubt
in
my
mind.
supposing
a
conscientious
lawyer
thinks
that
material
is
privileged,
and
he
refuses
to
disclose
it
in
response
to
a
discovery
demand,
and
the
magistrate
says,
i'm
going
to
sanction
you
$1,500
unless
you
pay
it
over.
he
says,
i
just
think
professionally
i
can't
do
it.
i'm
not
going
to
turn
it
over.
can
they
continue
to...
and
they
go
ahead
with
the
trial
and
try
the
case.
the...
but
they
could
continue
to
impose
more
and
more
sanctions
for
the
same
refusal,
and
there
would
be
no
way
to
review
it
until
the
case
is
over,
even
though
the
materials
might
be
critical
to
the
outcome
of
the
case.
unknown
speaker
in
other
words,
have
you...
this
is
the
point
that
i
was
worried
about.
i
mean,
have
you
ever
found
a...
i
can't
imagine
a
trial
judge,
when
the
lawyer
says,
judge,
i'm
going
to
appeal
this
at
the
end
of
the
case,
will
you
please
stay
it,
and
he
says
no.
i've
never
heard
of
such
a
thing.
have
you
come
across
such
a
thing?
i
may
just
be
overly
naive.
unknown
speaker
all
right.
now,
suppose
he
did.
suppose
we
ran
against
somebody
who's
having
a
temper
tantrum,
and
he's
going
to
be
unreasonable.
then
under
the
law,
are
you
permitted
to
go
to
the
court
of
appeals
and
say,
court
of
appeals,
we'd
like
a
writ
under
the
all
writs
act.
all
we
want
is
for
you
to
stay
this
order
so
we
have
a
chance
to
appeal.
would
you
be
entitled
to
it,
if
the
judge
is
having
a
temper
tantrum
and
won't
be
reasonable?
unknown
speaker
would
be.
is
there
any
authority
for
that?
unknown
speaker
i
think
justice
breyer
was
asking,
or
at
least
i
was
thinking,
is
there
any
case
on
it?
unknown
speaker
i
don't
understand
how
1292(b)
would,
because
how
is
this
order
making
it
appealable,
immediately
appealable
going
to
be
the
ultimate
determination
of
the
case,
and
how
is
it
a
controlling
question
as
to
which
there's
a
substantial
disagreement?
1292(b)
is
very
limited
in
terms...
it's
a
double
certificate,
and
it
requires
it
to
be
an
important
question
about
which
there's
a
substantial
disagreement,
and
that
immediate
determination
of
that
question
will
speed
the
underlying
lawsuit.
i
don't
think
you
can
meet
the
1292(b)
standards.
unknown
speaker
so
that's
why
i
don't
think
1292(b)
is
in
the
picture.
this
kind
of
thing
just
doesn't
fit
what
that
statute
contemplates.
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
the
distinction
is,
under
1292(b)
it
must
relate
to
the
merits,
and
under
cohen
it
may
not
relate
to
the
merits,
or
have
i
got
it
backwards?
unknown
speaker
separable,
whereas
under
1292(b)
it
must
control
the
merits.
unknown
speaker
well,
congress
certainly
recognized
that
finality
is
a
problem,
because
it
provided
now
twice,
once
in,
what
is
it,
1272(c)
and
1292(e)
for
rule
making
to
make
additional...
put
additional
things
on
the
list
of
interlocutory
appeals.
unknown
speaker
but
why...
but
it
seems
to
me
that
that
doesn't
foreclose
doing
it
by
adjudication.
unknown
speaker
but
you
concede
that
some...
that
this
is
a
sooner
or
later
question.
that
is,
it's
definitely
reviewable
ultimately.
unknown
speaker
i
don't
see
what
harm
is
done
by
adopting
the
petitioner's
resolution
here.
i
mean,
i
am
affected
by
the
fact
that
it's
within
the
total
control
of
the
district
court
to
prevent
any
disruption
by
simply
saying,
you
know,
i'm
not
going
to
impose
this
until
the
end
of
the
trial,
but
you're
going
to
get
whacked
pretty
hard,
and
you
do
it
again,
i'm
going
to
whack
you
harder,
but
i'll
wait
till
the
end
of
the
trial,
because
i
don't
want
the
trial
interrupted.
what's
the
problem
with,
once
you
announce
the
rule,
the
district
judge
knows
exactly
how
to
prevent
the
interference
with
the
trial?
unknown
speaker
it
isn't
a
threat,
it's
a
promise.
[laughter]
at
the
close
of
the
trial,
i
am
going
to
impose
upon
you
a
sanction
of,
you
know,
$20,000.
how
can
you
say
they
found
that
totally
ineffective?
i
think
a
lot
of
lawyers
would
listen
to
the
judge
when
the
judge
said
that.
i
know
i
would.
unknown
speaker
the
answer
is,
they
wouldn't
know.
the
district
judges
don't
know
every
rule,
nor
do
we.
the
lawyer's
out
of
the
case.
he's
going
to
sanction
him.
he's
not
there
anymore.
he
says
goodbye,
i'm
not
going
to
see
you
anymore,
i'm
going
home.
and
you
say,
fine,
when
you
go,
pay
$10,000.
i
mean,
that's
what's
going
to
happen.
i
don't
know
how
we
could
prevent
that,
whatever
rule
we
announce.
and
then
the
problem
it
seems
to
me
is,
well,
shouldn't
he
have
an
appeal
at
that
point.
he's
gone
home,
he
is
hurt,
and
that's
the
difficulty
for
you,
i
guess.
unknown
speaker
that's
all
true,
but
what
if
we
were
writing
the
opinion,
something
along
the
lines
justice
scalia
said,
the
better
practice,
absent
compelling
circumstances,
enforcement
of
all
these
orders
shall
be
postponed
until
the
litigation
is
over.
wouldn't
that
avoid
the
problem
for
everybody,
and
just...
we
could
just
follow
the
practice
of
waiting
till
the
case
is
over?
unknown
speaker
in
trying
to
think
of
your
answer
to
that
question,
i
was
thinking,
well,
it
might
not
be
sufficient,
because
the
judge
wants
an
immediate
sanction
that
works
to
control
this
attorney,
but
then
i
thought
the
answer
to
that
was,
if
the
attorney's
that
bad,
then
he
can
hold
him
in
contempt.
unknown
speaker
so
it
seems
to
me
that--
--you
wouldn't
acknowledge
that
holding
him
in
contempt
would
allow
an
immediate
appeal
anyway.
i
mean,
your
position
now
is
that
that
also
is
not
appealable
until
the
end
of
the
trial.
unknown
speaker
then
the
court
was
wrong
in
hickman
v.
taylor,
i
suppose,
in
allowing
that
to
go
up
as
an
interlocutory
appeal,
because
of
the
contempt.
unknown
speaker
it
couldn't
have
been
closer
than
in
hickman.
i
mean,
i
can't
imagine
a
closer
congruence.
unknown
speaker
there
was
another
sanction
here.
it
was...
and
i
don't...
there
was
a
$29,000
sanction
that
was
not
appealed.
what
was
that
for?
unknown
speaker
but
that
was...
it
was
confusing,
because
i
thought
the
attorney
was
both
sanctioned
and
disqualified,
and
that
was
an
under
$2,000
sanction,
and
then
there's
this
mention
of
another
sanction.
was
that
before
or
after
the
larger
one,
the
$29,000?
unknown
speaker
but--
unknown
speaker
--after
she
was
disqualified.
unknown
speaker
couldn't
the
appellate
court
just
wait,
i
mean,
just
say,
you
know,
we
have
this
appeal
here,
but
we're
going
to
hold
it
on
our
calendar
until
the
conclusion
of
the
trial
below?
could
the
appellate
court
do
that?
unknown
speaker
so
i
mean,
if
it
is
a
real
problem
like
that,
once
again
there's
a
solution.
huh--
unknown
speaker
--i
think
justice
breyer
was
about
to.
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
under
rule
11,
the
sanctions
can
sometimes
be
paid
to
the
injured
party
and,
under
your
rule,
you'd
have
to
pay
to
a
third
party
and
you
might
not
be
able
to
get
your
money
back.
you
might
be
judgment
proof.
unknown
speaker
but
under
rule
11,
sanctions
are
frequently
paid
to
the
injured
party,
to
the
moving
party.
unknown
speaker
all
i
meant
by
my
300
other
cases
on
the
docket
with
which
the
court
of
appeals
is
supposed
to
deal.
now
you're
going
to
agree
with
that
"huh".
unknown
speaker
thank
you,
mr.
arnold.
unknown
speaker
mr.
goldstein,
you
have
4
minutes
left.
what
case
do
you
rely
on
from
this
court
that
holds
a
sanction
against
an
attorney,
contempt
is
appealable?
unknown
speaker
did
the
court
discuss
appealability
at
all
in
hickman?
unknown
speaker
because
hickman
didn't
say
a
word
about
jurisdiction.
unknown
speaker
it
was
an
opinion
by
justice
murphy,
so--
[laughter]
did
the
third
circuit
say
something
about
jurisdiction?
unknown
speaker
well,
there
are
a
lot
of
cases
that
have
held
that
if
a
lawyer
is
held
in
contempt
for
failure
to
comply
with
a
court
order,
it's
immediately
appealable.
unknown
speaker
but
i...
that's
what
i
was
asking
you,
mr.
goldstein.
is
there
a
case
from
this
court
holding
what
justice
stevens
apparently
thinks
there
is?
the
answer's
yes,
but
i
can't
give
it
to
you.
[laughter]
imagine
that
as
an
exam
answer.
mr.
goldstein,
could
i
get
your
position
clear
on
one
thing?
what
if
the
sanction
had
been
imposed
upon
the
party?
unknown
speaker
and
you
already
told
me
in
response
to
the
earlier
colloquy
that
that
would
be
true
of
the
lawyer
as
well
if
the
lawyer
and
the
client
were
jointly
sanctioned.
unknown
speaker
so
if
everything
else
is
the
same,
but
the
magistrate
says,
you
and
your
client.
unknown
speaker
well,
if
you
say
the
contempt
rule
has
been
here
for
more
than
100,
you
must
know
some
case.
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
well,
as
a
practical
matter
in
this
case
we
were
just
told
that
in
fact
there
was
continuing
activity
involving
this
lawyer,
and
that's
what
accounts
for
the
subsequent
$29,000
sanction.
