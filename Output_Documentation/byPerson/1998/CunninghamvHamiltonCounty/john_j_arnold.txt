mr.
john
j.
arnold
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
to
respond
to
the
questions
raised
to
petitioner,
there
are
alternatives
which
congress
has
given
which
would
adequately
address
the
most
egregious
or
most
unjust
of
these
cases
where
sanctions
are
imposed
against
attorneys.
those
alternatives
are
available
in
the
appropriate
case.
secondly,
there's
a
very
practical
reason
for
treating
attorneys
differently
than
a
pure
nonparty
to
litigation.
the
attorney
comes
before
the
court
solely
on
behalf
of
the
client,
as
opposed
to
a
third
party
who
is
distant
from
the
litigation.
the
attorney's
interests
are
those
of
the
client,
and
are
entwined
with
the
outcome
of
the
case.
so
the
simple
question
before
this
court
today
is
whether
an
attorney
who
is
sanctioned
for
violating
a
pretrial
discovery
order
may
immediately
appeal
that
decision.
mr.
john
j.
arnold
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
john
j.
arnold
i
believe--
mr.
john
j.
arnold
--i
believe
the
analysis
is
different,
because
the
interests
of
a
pure
party
and
the
attorney
are
different.
secondly,
i
suggest
that
the...
whether
the
attorney
was
removed
from
the
case
or
continues
to
participate
should
not
affect
the
jurisdictional
question
which
was
before
the
court
of
appeals.
coincidentally
in
this
case,
district
court
judge
sandra
beckwith
removed
the
petitioner
on
the
same
date
as
she
imposed
the
first
set
of
sanctions
against
ms.
cunningham.
that
may
have
happened
at
some
later
time.
mr.
john
j.
arnold
but
it
does
not
affect
the
jurisdiction
of
the
appellate
courts,
respectfully.
that
jurisdiction
should
be
determined
as
of
the
date
the
order
was
issued.
subsequent
events
should
neither
confer
nor
take
away
jurisdiction,
except
in
extraordinary
cases.
for
example,
if
the
case
were
mooted
for
some
reason,
i
would
concede
that
that
would
in
effect
destroy
or
take
away
appellate
jurisdiction
if
it
existed,
but
we
submit
that
the
change
in
facts
after
the
fact
should
not
confer
or
destroy
jurisdiction.
mr.
john
j.
arnold
i'm
sorry.
mr.
john
j.
arnold
when
i
said
that,
i
was
referring
to
the
attorney
sanctions
may
become
moot
at
a
later
time.
either
they
might
be
set
aside,
merged
into
the
final
order,
settled--
mr.
john
j.
arnold
--no,
your
honor.
mr.
john
j.
arnold
in
my
experience,
at
some
point
in
time
there
is
going
to
be
some
document
filed
in
the
district
court
which
says,
this
case
is
dismissed,
this
case
is
reversed,
whatever.
there's
going
to
be
a
final
order
filed
in
the
district
court,
otherwise--
mr.
john
j.
arnold
--that
may
be
true,
and
that
may
impose
a
slight
burden
upon
the
attorney
to
essentially
monitor,
if
you
will,
to
calendar
in
a
tickler
file,
to
review
periodically
the
status
of
that
case
every
30
days
or
so,
and
i
suggest
that
that
burden
is
significantly
less
than
the
burdens
which
will
be
placed
on
the
parties
and
the
appellate
courts
by
repeated
or
multiple
interlocutory
appeals.
mr.
john
j.
arnold
the
contempt
sanction
is
different,
we
believe,
because
contempt
sanctions
are
typically
imposed
against
non
parties
who
are
unrelated
to
the
case.
it
is
a
more
severe
sanction--
mr.
john
j.
arnold
--because
their
interests
are
different
from
that
of
a
pure
nonparty.
their
interests
are
that
of
the
client.
the
client
cannot
appeal
a
contempt...
i'm
sorry.
the
client
cannot
appeal
a
discovery
order
immediately,
so
neither
should
the
attorney.
it's
a
lesser
sanction
imposed
against
the
attorney
than
contempt.
mr.
john
j.
arnold
yes,
your
honor,
but
to
treat
the
cases
differently
we
suggest
supports
the
underlying
reasons
behind
the
rule
of
finality,
and
that
is,
we
don't
want
to
have
multiple
appeals.
and,
indeed,
there
have
been
some
cases
which
have
suggested
in
the
lower
courts
that
when
an
attorney
is
found,
even
an
attorney
is
found
in
contempt,
his
or
her
interests
are
so
merged
with
that
of
a
client,
that
of
the
party,
that
the
appeal
may
only
lie
at
the
conclusion
of
the
case,
and
that,
we
suggest,
gives
a
very
practical
interpretation
to
the
final
judgment
rule.
mr.
john
j.
arnold
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
john
j.
arnold
it
is
a
more
severe
sanction
imposed
against
the--
mr.
john
j.
arnold
--client,
and
it
is
treated
differently,
i
think,
by
the
courts,
in
the
case
of
a
party
as
opposed
to
the
attorney,
and
the
reason--
mr.
john
j.
arnold
--in
not
every
case,
your
honor.
mr.
john
j.
arnold
not
in
every
case.
mr.
john
j.
arnold
for
example,
in
the
situation
where
the...
there
is
a
substantial
congruence
of
interests
between
the
nonparty,
or
the
attorney,
and
the
party
to
the
action.
mr.
john
j.
arnold
i
would
refer
the
court
to
a
decision
of
the
ninth
circuit,
the
coordinated
pretrial
proceedings
in
petroleum
products
antitrust
litigation
case,
a
1984
decision
of
the
ninth
circuit,
where
the
attorney
general,
i
believe
of
the
state
of
oregon,
was
sanctioned,
or
was
found
in
contempt,
and
his
interests
were
so
congruent,
or
so
substantially
similar
to
that
of
the
state
of
oregon,
that
the
court
ruled
that
the
appeal
was
not
immediately...
may
not
be
taken
immediately.
mr.
john
j.
arnold
to
do
so,
your
honor,
if
the
court
allows
even
an
appeal
of
a
contempt
citation
immediately,
will
cause
the
appellate
courts
to
become
entwined
in
reviewing
more
and
more
the
facts
of
the
underlying
litigation.
mr.
john
j.
arnold
i
am.
mr.
john
j.
arnold
that's
an
extension
of
the
rationale
that
applies
to
this
case,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
john
j.
arnold
yes,
it
would,
because
it
would
at
that
point
merge
with
the
final
judgment
of
the
case.
mr.
john
j.
arnold
well,
the
trial
court
does,
of
course,
have
the
discretion
to
decide
when
they
are
going
to
make
that
decision,
when
they
are
going
to
impose
that
sanction,
or
even
if
they...
and
the
courts
below
have
seen
the
situation
where
the
court
has
found,
or
ordered,
i'm
going
to
sanction
you
for
this
conduct,
but
has
not
determined
the
final
amount
of
the
sanction.
mr.
john
j.
arnold
or
they
may
say,
i'm
going
to
impose
a
sanction
of
$1,500,
but
stay
that
until
the
final
resolution
of
the
case.
mr.
john
j.
arnold
stay
the...
i'm--
mr.
john
j.
arnold
--the
execution
of
the
order,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
john
j.
arnold
if
this
court
adopts
a
rule
that
says
that
attorneys
may
only
appeal
from
the
final
decision
of
the
court,
no.
that
notice
of
appeal,
that
appeal
should
be
perfected
within
the
appropriate
time
from
the
final
order
of
the
district
court.
mr.
john
j.
arnold
in
terms
of--
mr.
john
j.
arnold
--i'm
sorry,
your
honor.
mr.
john
j.
arnold
that
is
one
resolution,
but
i
submit
the
better
resolution
is
to
simply
announce
a
bright
line.
either
the
attorney
can
appeal
or
not
appeal,
and
if
the
interests
which
support
the
finality
rule
suggest
that
the
most
practical,
the
most
judicially
efficient
manner
of
doing
it
is
to
announce
the
rule
that
the
attorney
may
perfect
that
appeal
at
the
conclusion
of
the
case.
mr.
john
j.
arnold
your
honor,
i
would
suggest
that
it's
a
balancing
test
the
court
has
to
reach,
and
it's
a
balancing
test
that
should
be
answered
not
just
on
this
particular
case,
on
a
$1,500
sanction,
but
on
the
broader
issue,
and
that
is,
there
will
be,
perhaps
in
the
case
where
sanctions
are
not
stayed,
some
financial
hardship
imposed
upon
the
attorney,
just
as
there
are
financial
hardships--
mr.
john
j.
arnold
--and
that
i
believe
is
one
of
the
balancing
factors,
one
of
the
factors
the
court
must
take
into
account
when
it
balances
these
things.
do
you
want
to
have
the
courts
of
appeal
reviewing
evidentiary
decisions
before
the
trial
is
over?
mr.
john
j.
arnold
we
have
not,
your
honor,
but--
mr.
john
j.
arnold
--yes,
your
honor,
you
would.
mr.
john
j.
arnold
the
all
writs
act,
and
there's
also
authority
in
section
1292(b)
of
title
28,
which--
mr.
john
j.
arnold
--i
have
not
seen
the
specific
case,
although
this
court,
in
numerous
decisions,
has
suggested
that
mandamus
is
an
alternative,
although
one
which
is
reserved
for
the
most
important
or
most
appropriate
of
cases
to
interlocutory
appeals,
as
it
has
suggested
that
1292(b)
is
an
alternative,
and
the
rule
making--
mr.
john
j.
arnold
--that
may
very
well
be
the
case
in
this
particular
facts,
or
in
any
attorney
sanctions,
that
you
cannot...
they
are
not--
mr.
john
j.
arnold
--justice
ginsburg,
if
it's
not
the
type
of
case
that
rises
to
the
level
of
the
urgency
and
the
importance
anticipated
by
section
1292(b),
i
would
submit
that
it's
also
not
the
type
of
case
that
rises
to
the
level
of
an
important
right
which
must
be
immediately
determined
by
the
court
of
appeals,
as
opposed
to
an
interest
or
a
question
which
may
be
answered
upon
the
final--
mr.
john
j.
arnold
--under
cohen
it
should
be
separable
from
the
merits.
mr.
john
j.
arnold
and
that
is
certainly
a
reason,
we
submit,
that
had
congress
intended
to
expand
that
limited
right
of
interlocutory
appeals
to
this
type
of
case,
they
would
have
done
so
in
the
language
of
1292(b).
mr.
john
j.
arnold
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
john
j.
arnold
it
does
not,
but
this
court
has
held
that
this
is
a...
that
the
cases
envisioned
by
cohen
are
a
narrow
class
of
cases
which
should
be
strictly
construed,
and
the
ultimate
question
is,
can
the
petitioner
in
this
case
obtain
a
fair
hearing
at
the
end
of
the
case?
can
she
file
her
notice
of
appeal
at
the
end
of
the
case
and
have
her
rights
protected?
unlike
the
cases
where
this
court
has
ruled
an
interlocutory
appeal
must
lie,
whether
it's
a
right
to
bail
bond
case,
or
a
double
jeopardy
case,
or
in
immunity
cases,
those
are
cases
that
stop,
or
prevent
the
underlying
litigation
from
going
forward.
this
case
is
more,
or
similar
to
that
of
a
speedy
trial
question,
or
the
question
involving
the
disqualification
of
counsel.
those
are
steps
toward
the
end
of
the
case.
they
are
steps
toward
resolving
the
case.
mr.
john
j.
arnold
yes,
your
honor.
and
the
question--
mr.
john
j.
arnold
--the
problem
with
that
is,
i
think
the
district
courts
have
found
that
that,
the
threat
of
a
sanction,
the
threat
of
punishment
has
not
been
effected.
mr.
john
j.
arnold
unfortunately,
not
all
attorneys
do
listen
to
the
judge,
and
the
rule
the
petitioner
is
proposing
opens
the
pandora's
box--
mr.
john
j.
arnold
--and
the
court
has
suggested
any
number
of
combinations
that
may
come
before
the
district
court
judge.
the
practical
matter
is
that
interlocutory
appeals
delay
and
hinder
the
district
court
proceedings.
they
impose
additional
burdens
on
the
parties
below.
they
disrupt
those
proceedings.
mr.
john
j.
arnold
that
would
avoid
the
situation
where
it's
a
purely
monetary
sanction
that's
imposed,
other
than
it
would
create
a
similar
hardship
on
the
party
who's
had
to
seek
the
sanction.
and
again--
mr.
john
j.
arnold
--or
remove
him
from
the
case,
and
if
removed
from
the
case,
the
attorney
would
have
no
right
of
immediate
appeal.
mr.
john
j.
arnold
because
of
the
similarity
of
interests
between
the
parties
and
the
attorney.
mr.
john
j.
arnold
in
this
particular
case,
your
honor,
we
submit
that
there
is
a
similarity,
or
such
a
close
congruence
of
the
relationships
and
the
interests
of
the
parties.
mr.
john
j.
arnold
again,
this
is
a
situation
where
the
district
court,
for
whatever
reason,
chose
not
to
go
that
further
step
and
impose
the
sanction
order,
or
the
contempt
order.
mr.
john
j.
arnold
it
was
actually
appealed.
at
the
conclusion
of
the
case,
after
summary
judgment
had
been
granted,
the
district
court
judge
imposed
another
$29,000
in
sanctions
against
the
petitioner
as
a
result
of
failure...
basically,
her
conduct
from
september
of
1986
forward.
that
was
also
appealed,
as
was
another
discovery
order
of
the
district
court.
that
case
was
settled,
and
that
was
in
favor
of
the
codefendant
below,
correctional
medical
services.
mr.
john
j.
arnold
the
$1,500,
or
the
$1,494
sanction
was
imposed
before
the
$29,000
sanction.
the
latter--
mr.
john
j.
arnold
--sanction
was
for
her
continued
refusal
to
cooperate
and
provide
documents
which
had
been
ordered
produced
by
the
district
court.
mr.
john
j.
arnold
yes,
your
honor.
this
case
presents
a
situation
where
the
review
of
the
attorney
sanction
order
is
closely
entwined
with
the
merits
of
the
underlying
case.
as
the
sixth
circuit
recognized,
it
is
not
a
case
which
would
turn
out
to
be
completely
separated
from
the
merits
of
the
underlying
case.
indeed,
rule
37
requires
the
district
court
in
imposing
sanctions
to
determine
if
the
nondisclosure
response
or
objection
was
substantially
justified.
it
is
essentially
another
opportunity
to
provide
a
way
to...
for
a
pretrial
appeal
of
discovery
orders,
because
included
in
any
review
by
the
court
of
appeals
would
have
had
to
have
been
the
question
of
relevancy,
was
this
information
that
she
was
sanctioned
for,
this
discovery
that
was
to
be
produced
that
was
not
produced,
was
it
relevant.
and
the
court
of
appeals
would
be
required
to
review
that
for
an
abuse
of
discretion,
which
is
an
inherently
fact
related
question,
for
prejudice
to
the
opposing
party
as
well
as
the
willfulness
or
culpability
of
the
sanctioned
counsel.
we
also
ask
this
court
to
consider
the
breadth
that
this
court's
rationale
or
decision
will
have
if
it
accepts
the
rationale
advanced
by
the
petitioner.
certainly,
it
will
apply
to
the
situation
where
rule
11
sanctions
are
imposed,
as
well
as
sanctions
under
28
u.s.
code
section
1927.
i
would
also
submit
that
it
applies
to
the
situation
where
both
the
party
and
the
attorney
are
jointly
sanctioned,
and
in
that
case
it
would
create
the
situation
where
the
attorney
could
step
forward
with
the
appeal,
but
the
party
could
not.
as
to
the
depth
of
the
sanction,
it
will
certainly
apply
to
any
monetary
sanction
of
whatever
amount,
and
i
submit
that
it
will
apply
to
sanctions
which
are
less
than
monetary,
sanctions
which,
in
effect,
cost
attorneys
time
and
money
but
are
steps
to
getting
on
with
the
case,
to
moving
the
case
along.
judicial
efficiency
will
be
impaired,
and
delay
will
result.
appellate
courts
will
find
themselves
effectively
reviewing
pretrial
discovery
orders,
reviewing
partial
records
where
the
entire
record
of
the
proceedings
below
would
be
most
helpful
to
them.
mr.
john
j.
arnold
yes,
your
honor,
they
could.
they
could
very
well
just
postpone
ruling
on
the
case.
mr.
john
j.
arnold
i'm
sorry.
may
i
respond
to
justice
scalia?
mr.
john
j.
arnold
to
do
so
will
still
increase
the
burdens
on
the
parties
in
the
courts
below.
whether
they
take
the
case
in
and
say,
well,
we're
just
not
going
to
decide
it
until
the
district
court
err...
or,
makes
its
decision
below,
and
then
if
an
appeal
is
filed
by
the
attorney
we'll
consolidate
them,
we
still
are
in
the
situation
where
we
have
multiple
appeals.
in
this
case,
the
defendant
below
would
be
required
to
fight
the
battle
on
multiple
fronts,
if
you
will.
mr.
john
j.
arnold
that
is
a
consideration.
however,
we
suggest
that
if...
the
rule
of
repayment
is
the
remedy
to
that.
if,
in
fact...
and
that
has
not
happened
in
this
case...
petitioner
had
paid
the
money,
and
if
for
some
reason
the
county
became
insolvent
thereafter,
and--
mr.
john
j.
arnold
--yes,
and
as
the
attorney
sanctions
would
have
been
paid
in
this
case,
they
would
have
been
paid
to
the
hamilton
county
treasurer.
mr.
john
j.
arnold
i
think
that
is
an
example
of
the
burdens
multiple
appeals
impose
upon
the
parties
and
the
courts
below.
in
summary,
we
ask
this
court
to
strictly
construe
the
final
judgment
rule
and
decline
to
expand
that
narrow
class
of
cases
to
which
cohen
applies,
to
pretrial
discovery
sanctions
imposed
by
the
district
court.
to
do
so,
to
require
the
appeal
to
be
brought
at
the
conclusion
of
the
case
will
avoid
judicial
delays,
it
will
serve
the
purposes
of
judicial
efficiency,
while
giving
the
petitioner
the
opportunity
at
the
close
of
the
case
to
raise
the
issue
on
appeal.
we
therefore
respectfully
ask
this
court
to
affirm
the
decision
of
the
sixth
circuit
court
of
appeals
and
rule
that
28
united
states
code
section
1291
bars
the
interlocutory
appeal
of
attorney
sanction
orders.
mr.
john
j.
arnold
thank
you,
your
honor.
