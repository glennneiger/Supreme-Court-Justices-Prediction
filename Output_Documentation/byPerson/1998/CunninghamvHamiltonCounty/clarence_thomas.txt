justice
clarence
thomas
this
case
comes
to
us
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
sixth
circuit.
involves
a
question,
what
happens
to
when
an
attorney
is
sanctioned
from
his
conduct
doing
discovery,
can
that
attorney
appeal
that
even
though
the
case
continuous
on?
petitioner
is
an
attorney
who
initially
represented
a
plaintiff
and
sued
against
respondent
and
others.
after
petitioner
failed
to
obey
certain
pretrial
discovery
orders,
a
magistrate
judge
directed
her
to
pay
monetary
sanctions
pursuant
to
federal
rule
of
civil
procedure
37(a).
a
district
court
affirmed
the
sanctions
order
and
also
disqualified
petitioner
as
plaintiff's
counsel.
while
the
suit
went
forward
as
i
indicated
petitioner
immediately
appealed
the
sanctions
order.
the
court
of
appeals
dismissed
her
appeal
for
lack
of
jurisdiction.
it
held
that
the
rule
37(a)
sanctions
order
did
not
fall
within
a
narrow
category
of
orders
known
as
collateral
orders,
which
maybe
appealed
prior
to
the
entry
of
judgment.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
we
affirm.
28
u.s.c.
section
1291
gives
federal
appellate
courts
with
the
jurisdiction
over
appeals
from
final
decisions
of
the
district
courts.
we
have
interpreted
this
provision
to
mean
that
an
appeal
ordinarily
will
not
lie
until
the
district
court
has
entered
final
judgment
unless
the
order
being
appealed
is
a
collateral
order.
a
collateral
order
is
conclusive,
resolves
an
important
question
completely
separate
from
the
merits
and
is
effectively
unreviewable
on
appeal
from
the
final
judgment.
we
hold
today
that
a
rule
37(a)
sanctions
order
does
not
qualify
as
a
collateral
order,
and
thus
is
not
the
final
decision
under
section
1291.
review
of
sanctions
orders
often
will
be
an
inextricably
intertwined
with
the
merits
of
the
case.
moreover,
an
attorney
suffers
no
undue
hardship
from
deferring
appellate
consideration
of
a
rule
37(a)
sanction
which
unlike
a
contempt
finding
is
not
designed
to
compel
immediate
compliance
with
an
order
of
the
court.
our
conclusion
that
a
rule
37(a)
sanctions
order
is
not
a
final
decision,
applies
even
where
as
here
the
attorney
no
longer
participates
in
the
case.
the
opinion
of
the
court
is
unanimous.
justice
kennedy
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion.
