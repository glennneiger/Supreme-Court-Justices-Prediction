mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
district
court
in
this
case
sanctioned
petitioner,
who
is
not
a
party
to
the
underlying
litigation,
but
instead
was
the
plaintiff's
counsel.
the
question
presented
to
this
court
is
at
what
time
petitioner
should
appeal
the
sanction.
the
sixth
circuit
recognized
that
there
were
three
possible
answers
to
that
question.
the
first,
and
this
is
the
rule
the
that
the
sixth
circuit
adopted,
is
that
petitioner
should
wait
until
the
final
judgment
in
the
case.
that
rule,
however,
has
some
serious
problems.
first
and
foremost,
it
conflicts
with
this
court's
repeated
holding
for
more
than
100
years
that
only
parties
may
appeal
the
final
judgment.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
mr.
chief
justice,
there
is
an
indication
in
this
court's
precedents
that
there
are
a
class
of
persons
known
as
quasi
parties
who
may
appeal,
but
the
quasi
party
cases
do
not
determine
whether
or
not
that
appeal
should
be
brought
at
the
end
of
the
case
or
not.
this
court's
most
recent
precedents,
particularly
marino
v.
ortiz
and
karcher
v.
may,
instruct
that
the
test
is
whether
or
not
the
individual
who
seeks
to
appeal
could
intervene
in
the
case
under
rule
24(b),
and
there
is
no
question
that
petitioner
could
not
intervene
under
rule
24(b).
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
the
circuits
that
have
confronted
this
question
uniformly
agree,
and
so
do
we,
that
when
that
sanction
merges
into
the
final
judgment,
practicalities
require
that
the
sanction
itself
come
up
together,
because
it
would
be
injudicious--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--that
is
correct,
but
we
do
believe
that
that
position
is
consistent
with
our
views
of
rules
3
and
4
of
the
federal
rules
of
appellate
procedure.
that
sanction
merges
into
the
final
judgment
because
it
is...
it
operates
upon
the
client.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
respectfully,
no.
there
are
very
serious
practical
consequences
that
make
this
sanction
effectively
unreviewable
at
the
end
of
the
case
under
the
third
prong
of
the
cohen
doctrine.
in
particular,
we--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--the--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--it
requires
this
court
to
track
rule
3
of
the
federal
rules
of
appellate
procedure,
and
that
rule
instructs
that
you
may
appeal
from
an
order
or
a
judgment
to
which
you
are
a
party.
no
one
contests
that
the
petitioner
is
a
party
to
the
sanction
order.
it
is
directed
at
her.
she
is
not,
however,
a
party
to
the
final
judgment,
with
which
she
has
nothing
to
do.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
mr.
chief
justice,
this
court
has
been
quite
clear
that
the
final
judgment
itself
has
to
be
looked
at
in
isolation,
and
you
determine
whether
or
not
the
appellant
is
a
party
to
the
final
judgment.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
that
is
correct,
the
difference
being
that
under
rule
4
of
the
federal
rules
of
appellate
procedure
she
is
precluded
from
appealing
the
sanction
order
more
than
30
days
after
it's
entered.
she
is
directed...
the
rule
directs
that
you
appeal
upon
the
entry
of
the
order
or
the
judgment.
rule
4
further
instructs
that
the
entry
is
to
be
determined
under
the
entry
definition
in
the
rules
of
civil
procedure,
and
that
is
when
it
is
placed
upon
the
docket
by
the
clerk
of
the
district
court.
the
sanction
order
here
was
entered
upon
the
docket.
it
was
the
only
thing
that
she
could
appeal
from
as
a
practical
matter
under
the
federal
rules
of
appellate
procedure.
she
had
no
other
choice.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
that
is
correct.
this
court
has
instructed
that
mere
discovery
rulings,
or
anything
else,
really,
that
goes
to
a
party
to
the
litigation,
one
of
the
actual
litigants,
all
of
those
merge
into
the
final
judgment.
but
the
court
has
been
equally
clear
that
when
it
is
a
third
party,
when
it
is
not
a
litigant
who
is
in
question,
and
we
point
the
court
particularly
to
alexander
and
its
progeny,
which
are
discussed
at
length
in
the
blue
brief,
and
those
cases
instruct
that
when
you
are
dealing
with
a
third
party
who
has
been
punished
by
the
district
court,
that
order
does
not
merge
into
the
final
judgment.
the
only
time
that
it
may
be
appealed
is
directly
upon
its
imposition.
the
court
has
drawn
a
very
clear
line
between
the
actual
litigants
before
the
district
court
and
third
parties
who
might
be
punished
by--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--exactly.
if
i
could
return
to
your
earlier
question,
the
sanction
is
effectively
unreviewable,
notwithstanding
a
holding
by
this
court
that
petitioner
technically
could
file
a
notice
of
appeal
from
the
final
judgment.
there
are
two
classes
of
reasons.
the
first
is,
it
is
not
at
all
clear
that
there
will
be
a
final
judgment.
the
district
court,
for
whatever
reason,
might
never
close
the
case,
the
case
could
settle,
the
case
could
simply
languish,
and
the
attorney
would
never
have
a
triggering
right,
under
the
federal
rules
of
appellate
procedure
ever
to
bring
such
an
appeal.
in
addition,
along
with
those
practical
considerations,
the
attorney
really
is
injured
in
the
interim.
we
do
not
believe
that
this
is
an
independent
ground
for
appeal,
but
when
you
look
at
all
the
practical
considerations
for
an
attorney,
the
attorney
is
forced
to
pay
the
money--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--respectfully,
no.
there
is
a
subtle
but
very
important
difference
for
purposes
of
rule
4.
the
order
itself
was
not
stayed.
petitioner
requested
twice
that
it
be
stayed.
after
she
filed
the
notice
of
appeal,
the
collection
of
the
sanction
was
stayed,
and
our
point
remains
that
under
federal
rule
of
appellate
procedure
4,
she
is
required
to
appeal
not
from
the
collection
of
the
sanction
but
from
the
entry
of
the
order.
to
give
another
example--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--no.
we
respectfully
believe
that
that
is
a
good
course
for
district
courts
to
take.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
if
a
district
court
were
to
do
so,
if
the
district
court
were
to
announce
to
an
attorney,
i
believe
you
have
contravened
my
ruling,
i
believe
you
have
engaged
in
irresponsible
conduct
and
at
the
end
of
this
case
i
am
going
to
sanction
you
$1,500,
$10,000,
what
have
you,
that
order
would
not
be
immediately
appealable.
that
is
the
balance--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--i
take
that
distinction.
that
is
fair.
if
the
district
court
were
to
not
finally
enter
the
order
until
the
conclusion
of
the
case,
or
were
to
expressly
provide
that
the
sanction
will
merge
into
the
final
judgment,
respondent's
point
would
be
well
taken,
and
these
sanctions
would
be
appealed
at
the
end
of
the
case.
we
are
attempting
to
create
a
situation
in
which
the
district
court
has
a
balance.
if
the
district
court
believes
that
the
situation
is
so
serious
that
the
sanction
has
to
be
finally
entered
right
now,
and
that
direction
to
pay
has
to
be
entered
right
now,
then
the
attorney
is
finally
told
and
the
sanction
is
determined
completely
as
to
her.
and
when
we
have
that
third
party
situation,
where
the
district
court
is
not
going
to
return
to
the
sanction,
when
the
issue
is
decided,
it
is
final
as
to
the
attorney
and
she
could
and
should
bring
the
appeal
immediately.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
there
is
no
harm
in
a
clear,
single
rule,
and
that's--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--respectfully,
that's...
two...
we
should
make
two
points.
we
do
think
that
our
rule
is
perfectly
clear.
if
you
are
an
attorney
and
you
are
sanctioned
alone,
file
your
notice
of
appeal.
we
don't
believe
that
that
gives
rise
to
any
sort
of--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--respectfully,
no.
but
if
i
could
first
deal
with
the
rule
8
problem,
and
that
is
that
rule
8
is
triggered
once
you
file
a
timely
notice
of
appeal.
if
this
court's
holding
is
that
the
notice
of
appeal
in
the
first
instance
is
not
proper
and
not
timely,
none
of
the
federal
rules
of
appellate
procedure
apply,
including
the
ability
to
get
a
stay,
including
the
ability
to
get
a
supersedeas
bond--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--the
court
has
been
very
clear
that
writs
of
mandamus--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--respectfully,
we
do
not
believe
so.
the
court
has
been
very
clear
that
the
writs
under
the
all
writs
act,
including
writs
of
mandate,
prohibition,
and
the
like,
are
confined
to
keeping
the
district
court
within
the
lawful
exercise
of
its
jurisdiction,
and
it's
very
difficult
to
conceive,
no
matter
how
much
the
financial
burden
is
upon
the
lawyer,
that
you
can
make
the
argument
that
it's
outside--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--the
federal
rules
of
appellate
procedure
and
its
stay
provisions,
including
rule
8,
are
not
triggered
at
that
point
because
there
is
no
timely
notice
of
appeal.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
we
do
read
the
rules
to
not
permit
it,
and
in
fact
we
have
studied
every
single
interlocutory
attorney
sanction
appeal
that
has
been
brought
in
the
last
20
years,
and
a
court
of
appeal
has
never,
ever
allowed
a
writ
of
mandamus
or
rule
54(b)
certification,
a
1292
certification.
the
courts
of
appeal
expect
you
to
file
a
timely
notice
of
appeal,
and
those
circuits
that
are
on
the
bottom
of
the
split
and
do
not
believe
that
an
interlocutory
appeal
is
permitted
simply
will
have
nothing
to
do
with
it.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
justice
ginsburg,
the
court
has...
and
you
have
pointed
this
out
in
an
earlier
opinion
for
the
court
that
that
option
is
open
to
this
court
to
begin
the
rule
making
process,
which
respectfully,
it
has
never
seen
fit
to
do,
and
there
are
no
less
than
a
dozen
splits
in
the
circuits
about
when
various
interlocutory
orders
may
be
brought
to
this
court.
we
have
no
objection
if
the
court
were
to,
in
addition,
use
its
rule
making
authority
to
resolve
these
conflicts,
but
the
court
does
have
before
it
this
case.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
the
textual
authority
does
lie
squarely
within
28
u.s.c.
1291.
this
is
literally
and
figuratively
a
final
decision.
it
is
complete
as
to
petitioner.
the
district
court
is
not
going
to
ever
revisit
the
sanction.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
there
is
no
term,
final
order
for--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--yes.
that's
exactly
right,
and
the
court
has
made
clear
that
it
is
a
practical
construction
of
the
term,
final
decision,
and
in--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--we
believe
that
the
practical
considerations
do
favor
petitioner
in
this
case.
in
particular,
there
is
the
grave
concern
that
she
could
not
appeal
from
the
final
judgment,
but
that
cannot
be
the
right
result.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
that's
correct.
petitioner
believed
that
it
was
inappropriate
for
her
to
bring
an
appeal
from
the
final
judgment
in
the
case.
it
is
worth
noting
that
at
the
time
she
filed
her
notice
of
appeal,
every
single
circuit
that
had
confronted
these
facts
had
ruled
in
her
favor.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
that
is
not
correct,
respectfully.
under
rule
38...
there
were
sanctions
motions
filed
upon
the
filing
of
this
notice
of
appeal.
under
rule
38,
if
she
files
an
improper
notice
of
appeal
she
can
get
herself
in
more
trouble,
but
i
do
want
to
pick
up--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--for
filing
an
improper
notice
of
appeal
from
the
final--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--at
the...
it
is
a
concern
that
the
attorney,
even
if
she
is
not
going
to
be
sanctioned,
should
still
appeal
when
it's
appropriate
and
should
not
be
filing
unnecessary
protective
appeals,
but
it
is
worth
returning
to
our
argument
under
rule
4(a)(2),
and
that
is
that
the
federal
rules
of
appellate
procedure
explicitly
contemplate
that
if
you
file
too
early
your
notice
of
appeal
automatically
functions
to
be
protective.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
that's
absolutely
correct.
we
have
fitted
within
the
cohen
doctrine
because
most
of
the
courts
of
appeal
have,
but
the
closest
analogue,
truthfully,
are
the
cases
in
which
this
court
has
dealt
with
third
parties
who
are
punished,
and
they
deal
with
them
completely
outside
of
the
cohen
doctrine,
because
it's
final
as
to
that
person,
cases
like
alexander
and
the
like.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
respectfully,
yes.
we
believe
that,
for
example,
under
rule
16(h)
of
the
rules
of
civil
procedure,
petitioner
could
have
been
held
in
civil
contempt,
and
there
is
no
question
that...
respectfully,
we
believe
there's
no
question
that
she
could
have
appealed
at
that
time,
because
the
court
is
very
clear
that
nonparty
civil
contempts
are
immediately
appealable.
there
is
no
practical
difference
in
terms
of
the
effect
on
district
courts,
or
on
the
effect
on
courts
of
appeals.
why,
if
the
district
court
says,
this
is
not
merely
a
rule
37
sanction,
i'm
going
to
put
next
to
it
the
word
contempt,
why
one
should
be
appealable
and
one
should
not.
in
addition--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--yes.
in
fact,
that's
the
express
direction.
the
most
recent
case
is
united
states
catholic
conference
in
1988,
and
that
was
absolutely
interlocutory,
and
the
precedents
in
the
blue
brief
explain
that
a...
appeal
from
the
final
judgment
in
fact
would
not
be
permitted.
they
have--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--rule
37
requires
that
there
be
a
notice
and
opportunity
to
be
heard,
but
civil
contempt
cases
do
not
draw
a
greater
distinction,
and
in
particular,
again,
rule
16(h)
allows
the
district
court
to
simply
deem
this
to
be
a
contempt,
and
so
does
rule
37(b),
which
also
deals
with
discovery
sanctions.
if
petitioner
had
continued
to
refuse
to
turn
over
the
documents,
for
example,
she
could
have
been
money
sanctioned,
or
the
district
court
could
have
deemed
it
to
be
a
civil
contempt.
in
terms
of...
there
just
would
be
no
practical
difference
on
the
effect
on
the
district
court
or
a
court
of
appeal
that
a...
that
the
district
court
labels
it
contempt.
but
if
we
could...
if
i
could
mention
one
other
practical
difference,
and
that
is,
it
seems
a
bad
practical
and
policy
judgment
to
tell
the
attorney,
well,
if
you
go
that
one
step
further
and
get
yourself
held
in
civil
contempt,
then
you
can
appeal,
because
that
has
grave
collateral
consequences
on
the
attorney's
client.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
respondent
has
suggested
that
this
rule
that
we
propose
would
lead
to
lots
of
attempts
to
appeal,
that
attorneys
might
get
themselves
sanctioned
in
order
to
have
the
right
to
take
an
appeal,
and
we
hope
the
court
will
take
the
same
practical
view
of
that
as
well.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
well,
justice
breyer--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--this
is
briefed
at
length
in
the
case.
we
respectfully
do
not
believe
that
appeals
of
rule
37
sanctions
and
rule
11
sanctions
do
bring
up
the
case,
because
what
is
being
appealed
is
not
the
underlying
determination
by
the
district
court,
but
instead
whether
or
not
the
attorney
misbehaved,
and
that
is
the
line
that
this
court
drew
in--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--there
are
two
answers.
the
first
deals
with
the
legal
standard,
and
the
second
with
what
actually
is
brought
up
on
appeal.
the
cohen
doctrine
cases
from
this
court
are
very
clear
that
the
concern
is
that
you
are
not
bringing
up
on
an
interlocutory
appeal
the
merits
of
one
of
the
claims.
we
do
not
want
a
situation
where
you're
going
to
appeal
now
and
the
client's
going
to
come
along
6
months
later
and
bring
the
same
appeal.
and
when
you
have
the
question
on
appeal,
to
turn
to
the
practical
effect
of
what's
brought
up
for
the
appeal,
if
you
take
a
rule
37
sanctions,
the
question
is,
did
the
attorney
behave
unreasonably
in
believing
that
a
particular
question
or
deposition
or
interrogatory
would
lead
to
the
discoverability
of
admissible
evidence,
and
we
proceed
further
and
further
away
from
the
actual
merits
of
the
legal
claims.
and
in
point
of
fact,
this
court
let
this
split
in
the
circuits
percolate
for
two
decades,
and
the
majority
rule
in
the
circuits
by
far,
based
on
the
experiences
of
courts
of
appeal
judges
like
you
formerly
were,
mr.
justice
breyer,
is
that
this
does
not
intertwine
with
the
merits
and
disrupt
district
court
proceedings.
in
particular,
the
court
looks
at...
the
courts
have
noted
two
points.
it
doesn't
result
in
a
stay
of
the
district
court
proceedings
because
the
district
court
case,
just
like
it
did
here,
continues
apace
until
it
gets
to
final
judgment.
and,
pointedly,
unlike
a
lot
of
this
courts
interlocutory
appeal
cases,
it's
not
going
to
moot
out.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
it
happens--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--yes.
it
is
never--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--that's
correct.
it
has...
it
does
happen
in
the
district
court
that
attorneys
can
be
sanctioned
more
than
one
time.
our
experience,
in
reviewing
every
single
example
in
the
courts
of
appeals,
it
has
never
occurred
that
multiple
appeals
have
been
brought
from
the
same
case,
and
there
is
a
reason
for
that.
and
that
is
that
while
attorneys
may
get
themselves
sanctioned,
they
tend
not
to
be
so,
for
lack
of
a
better
term,
stupid
as
to
continue
to
bring
their
case
to
the
court
of
appeals
only
to
get
shot
down
again
and
again
in
the
federal
reports.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
as
a
practical
matter
in
the
court
of
appeal,
those
appeals
will
be
consolidated
by
the
court
of
appeals
under
rule
3.
there...
it
is,
we
respectfully
submit,
final
as
to
the
attorney
each
time
a
final
sanction
order
is
entered,
but
again--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--there
are
two
keys
to
the
disqualification
cases.
the
first
is
the
conclusion
in
richardson
merrell
that
the
attorney
doesn't
get
to
appeal
the
disqualification.
that
runs
against
the
client,
not
against
the
attorney.
and
the
second
is
that
the
district
court
proceedings
will
be
stayed,
and
it
will
disrupt
them.
if
i
could
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
the
hickman
example,
justice--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--no,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
the
court
is
very
clear
that
there
aren't
implicit
jurisdictional
holdings.
we
do
not
claim
that
this
court's
decision
in
this
case
is
predetermined
by
hickman.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
i
believe
that
that--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--justice
ginsburg,
i
believe
we
are
beyond
my
familiarity
with
hickman
and
taylor.
i
don't
want
to
represent
to
you
that
i
know
the
third
circuit's
opinion
in
that
case,
but
i
can
tell
you
that
the
court's
cases
dealing
with
contempt
do
deal
with
very
analogous
situations.
cases
like
alexander
and
its
progeny
involve
agents
of
the
party
to
the
case.
it
is
very,
very
close.
in
addition,
the
rationale
is
the
same.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
we
have
not
seen
contrary
authority.
i--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--nonappealable.
it
merges
into
the
final
judgment.
that's
a
very
clear
line,
we
respectfully
submit.
there
are
third
parties,
and
there
are
parties
who--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--yes.
as
a
practical
matter,
that
has
to
operate
to
merge
into
the
final
judgment.
that's
the
uniform
view
of
the
courts
of
appeals.
just
simply
the
fact
that
the
client
can't
appeal,
it
has
to--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--yes,
and
remember
that
the
magistrate
is
making
a
conscious
decision.
rules

and
37
ask
the
district
judge
to
make
a
choice.
is
this
the
fault
in
any
way
of
the
party,
or
is
it
instead
the
fault
of
the
lawyer?
and
if
it's
the
fault
of
the
lawyer,
it
says,
sanction
the
attorney.
treat
them
as
separate
from
the
party.
this
is
not
an
agency
point,
where
the
attorney
is
appealing
on
behalf
of
her
client.
it's
against
her,
and
when
it's
done,
it's
done
against
her.
she
has
been
sanctioned.
there
is
a
final
decision
against
her.
i
want
to
pick
up,
however,
if
i
could,
on
the
sort
of
parade
of
horribles
we
got
from
the
respondent.
we
submit
that
this
has
been
the
rule
in
a
number
of
circuits
for
two
decades.
the
contempt
rule
has
been
here
for
more
than
100
years,
and
this
as
a
practical
matter
has
not
happened.
the
ninth
circuit--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--that
is
correct.
alexander
says
nonparties.
alexander
says
nonparties,
that
the
final
judgment
would
not
bring
up
their
appeal,
and
there
has
never
been
a
contrary
suggestion
in
a
court
of
appeals
that
an
attorney
would
not
fall
within
that
rule.
i
also
do
believe
that
there
is
not
an
answer
to
the
line
drawn
when
the
attorney
isn't
in
the
case
anymore.
the
respondent's
view
is
that
my
client's
interests
are
intertwined
with
those
of
her
client,
but
she's...
that...
it
isn't
her
client
anymore.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
the
attorney's
conduct
in...
the
petitioner's
conduct
that
was
sanctioned
at
the
end
of
the
case
involved
her
activity
as
counsel.
to
the
extent
she
was
a
witness
in
the
case,
she
would
be
able
to
appeal,
which
is
the
status
she
had.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
