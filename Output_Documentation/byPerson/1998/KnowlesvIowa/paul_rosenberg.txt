mr.
paul
rosenberg
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
by
statute
in
iowa,
police
are
authorized
to
search
any
motor
vehicle
in
which
the
driver
receives
a
traffic
citation.
the
question
presented
here
is
whether
iowa's
search
incident
citation
statute
shall
be
adopted
by
this
court
as
a
new
category
of
per
se
reasonable
searches.
it
was
in
march
of
19--
mr.
paul
rosenberg
--well,
the
iowa
supreme
court
has
construed
this
language
that
says
otherwise
lawful
search
to
extend
the
search
incident
to...
excuse
me...
search
incident
to
arrest
exception
to
encompass
those
circumstances
where
a
citation
is
issued
and
there
is
in
fact--
mr.
paul
rosenberg
--yes.
yes,
they
did
say
that.
mr.
paul
rosenberg
that's
correct,
your
honor.
in
march
of
1996,
mr.
knowles
was
pulled
over
for
speeding
in
newton,
iowa.
in
all
respects,
this
was
a
routine
traffic
encounter.
mr.
knowles
was
obedient
to
the
single
deterrent
to
pull
over.
he
produced
a
valid
driver's
license.
a
computer
check
revealed
that
there
were
no
warrants
for
his
arrest,
and
the
police
officer
testified
that
he
had
no
suspicion--
mr.
paul
rosenberg
--we
didn't
raise
the
question
of
lawfulness
of
the
arrest.
we're
only
questioning
the
lawfulness
of
the
subsequent
search.
mr.
paul
rosenberg
if
i
answered
that
way
to
justice
o'connor's
question,
then
i
misspoke.
the
statute
says
otherwise
lawful
search.
the
iowa
supreme
court
held
that
the
search
was
lawful.
at
no
stage
in
the
proceeding
from
the
district
court
to
the
iowa
supreme
court
to
this
court
have
we
contested
the
validity
of
the
arrest...
excuse
me...
the
stop
in
this
case
or
the
authority
to
arrest
in
the
circumstances
of
a
traffic
citation.
mr.
paul
rosenberg
yes,
under--
mr.
paul
rosenberg
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
the
officer
testified
that
he
had
no
suspicion
that
mr.
knowles
was
carrying
contraband
or
a
weapon
or
that
he
had
such
items
concealed
on
his
person
or
in
his
car.
at
this
point,
being
satisfied,
he
issued
the
citation
to
mr.
knowles,
handed
it
to
him,
and
mr.
knowles
signed
it.
at
this
point,
the
officer
radioed
for
backup
and
searched
mr.
knowles'
person
and
his
automobile.
he
found
a
small
quantity
of
marijuana
and
what
the
officer
called
a
pot
pipe.
at
the
suppression
hearing,
the
officer
testified
that
he
had
no
justification
and
no
search...
excuse
me...
no
consent
to
conduct
a
search.
he
was
relying
entirely
on
iowa's
search
incident
to
citation
law.
the
supreme
court,
in
deciding
mr.
knowles'
appeal,
essentially
held
that
the
search
incident
to
arrest
doctrine,
which
in
united
states
v.
robinson
was
held
to
be
a
per
se
reasonable
search,
that
this
doctrine
was
going
to
be
extended
by
the
state
of
iowa
by
virtue
of
the
statute
to
situations
in
which
a
citation
was
issued.
the
fundamental
premise
of
the
iowa
supreme
court's
decision
was
that
the
search
incident
to
arrest
doctrine
does
not
require
a
custodial
arrest.
it
merely
requires
grounds
for
arrest
or
cause
for
arrest.
this
premise
is
incorrect.
the
search
incident
to
arrest
doctrine
has
historical
legitimacy.
it
existed
at
the
common
law
in
this
country
and
in
england,
and
it
was
always
thought
to
involve
search
incident
to
arrest
as
a
necessary
and,
it
was
assumed,
reasonable
search.
there
was
no
comparable
historical
roots
or
historical
legitimacy
for
a
search
incident
to
a
citation
or
a
search
incident
to
any
other
means
by
which
a
criminal
prosecution
would
be
commenced
outside
of
an
arrest.
also,
in--
mr.
paul
rosenberg
--the
actual--
mr.
paul
rosenberg
--the
actual
stop
would
not
be
an
arrest.
mr.
paul
rosenberg
no.
that
would
be
a...
a...
a
seizure,
a
brief
detention,
and
this
court
has
held
that
it's
a
seizure.
but
in
order
to
effectuate
an
arrest,
the
officer
would
have
to
essentially
handcuff
the
person
and
take
them
to
the
police
station.
an
arrest--
mr.
paul
rosenberg
--all
arrested
persons
are
handcuffed,
yes.
mr.
paul
rosenberg
if
he
had
the
necessary
suspicion--
mr.
paul
rosenberg
--he
could
have
conducted
a
terry
pat-down.
mr.
paul
rosenberg
well,
as
recently
as
minnesota
v.
dickerson,
the...
this
court
has
reaffirmed
the
requirement
of
terry,
that
there
be
some
articulable
basis
to
believe
this
person
is
armed
and
dangerous.
mr.
paul
rosenberg
no,
i
don't
believe
that
simply
speeding--
mr.
paul
rosenberg
--yes,
that's
correct.
mr.
paul
rosenberg
if
he
had
done
that,
then
it
would
have
been
a
valid
search
incident
to
a
lawful
arrest.
mr.
paul
rosenberg
yes,
but
that
is
a
distinction
that...
that--
mr.
paul
rosenberg
--well,
your
honor,
an
arrest
in
iowa
does
not
differ
in
terms
of
the
seriousness
of
the
offense.
an
arrest
is
placing
somebody
in
the
custody
of
the
state.
the
state
exercises
dominion
over
their
body,
and
they
are
arrested
for
the
purposes
of
commencing
a
prosecution
for
a
public
offense.
it
necessarily
entails
going
to
the
jail
and
being
booked
at
the
jail
and
having
to
post
bond.
that
is
what
i
understand
to
be--
mr.
paul
rosenberg
--i
didn't
mean...
i
just
meant
to
say
that
when
the
officer
says
you're
under
arrest,
that
would
commence
the
arrest
process.
that
is
not
the
entire
arrest.
that
would
begin
the
arrest
process.
you
are
under
arrest.
the
officer
would
take
control
of
the
person.
then
the
rest
of
the
procedure
would
have
to
be--
mr.
paul
rosenberg
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
paul
rosenberg
i
think
under
bumpers
v.
north
carolina,
that
would
be
a
legitimate
reason
for
questioning
the
voluntariness
of
that
consent
because
that
would
be...
just
be
an
acquiescence
and
a
claim
of
lawful
authority
by
the
police
officer.
i
would
question--
mr.
paul
rosenberg
--well,
i
think
that
would...
that
would
simply
be
an
issue
of
whether
the
consent
would
be...
would
be
valid.
i
think
consent
can
be
coerced
by
threats
to
do
lawful
things
as
well
as
unlawful
things.
and
i
think
that
was
basically
the...
the
holding
in
bumpers
v.
north
carolina.
mr.
paul
rosenberg
i
would
like
to
answer
that
question
by
quoting
from
united
states
v.
robinson,
414
u.s.
at
234,
note
5.
i
quote.
the
danger
to
the
police
officer
flows
from
the
fact
of
arrest
and
its
attendant
proximity,
stress,
and
uncertainty,
and
not
from
the
grounds
for
arrest.
and
i
would
elaborate
further
that
a
traffic
citation
is
a
very
common
occurrence
in
this
country.
in
iowa
alone,
we
average
400,000-plus
a
year.
citizens
are
not
in
great
fear
when
they're
pulled
over
for
a
traffic
violation.
they
know
it
will
be
a
brief
encounter.
they
know
that
they
will
soon
be
free
to
go.
they
know
they
will
receive
a
summons.
they
can
go
to
court
to
contest
it,
but
most
elect
to
pay
a
fine
and
plead
guilty.
this
is
not
a
provocative
encounter.
whereas
an
arrest
presents
other
unique
threats
to
the
officer's
safety.
the
person
may
have
items
in
his
car
that
if...
if
were
uncovered,
he
might
go
to
a
prison
for
a
long
period
of
time,
including
life.
and
there
is
going
to
be
an
extreme
danger
trying
to
bring
this
person
under
control
if
he
has
a
lot
to
lose
by
being
brought
under
control.
mr.
paul
rosenberg
yes,
that
is--
mr.
paul
rosenberg
--that's
correct.
mr.
paul
rosenberg
justice
scalia,
i
am
not
aware
that
the
common
law
had
any
other
means
to
prosecute
a
criminal
offense...
to
commence
the
prosecution
of
a
criminal
offense
outside
of
arrest.
but
i
also
believe
with
the
proliferation
of
a
lot
of
minor
misdemeanor
offenses
in
this
country,
that
the
citation
came
into
vogue
as
a
more
reasonable
manner
in
which
to...
to
prosecute
a
criminal
offense.
mr.
paul
rosenberg
i...
i
do
not
know
that
the
common
law
distinguished
between
a...
a
simple
seizure
of
the
person
and
an
arrest.
i
think
that
a
lot--
mr.
paul
rosenberg
--the
only
common
law
history
that
i'm
aware
of
is
that
which
was
referred
to
in
united
states
v.
robinson
where
the
court
indicated
that
the
common
law
authority
or
historical
sources
in
this
respect
were
scarce.
and
the
court--
mr.
paul
rosenberg
--we
didn't
have
any.
mr.
paul
rosenberg
that's
correct,
but
i
believe
later
this
court
clarified
its
decision
in
berkemer
and
said
if
the
officer
had
told
this
individual
that
he
was
under
arrest
at
the
inception
of
this
particular
encounter,
then
the
court
would
have
considered
that
an
arrest.
mr.
paul
rosenberg
oh,
it
was?
mr.
paul
rosenberg
i
don't
know
if
it
was
a
clarification
or
not.
i
don't...
i'm
not
going
to
venture
a
guess
at
that.
there's
another
reason
that
searches
incident
to
arrest
differ
from
searches
incident
to
citation,
and
that
is
in
a
lot
of
fourth
amendment
areas,
a
larger
intrusion
will
subsume
a
smaller
intrusion
or,
so
to
speak,
lesser
included
intrusions.
and
once
the
person
has
been
taken
into
custody
for
arrest,
a
lot
of
rights
are
lost,
a
lot
of
things
can
be
done
which
in
and
of
themselves
would
have
been
intrusive
or
in
violation
of
the
fourth
amendment,
but
when
subsumed
by
the
greater
intrusion
are
no
longer
the
case.
in
a
situation
where
a
citation
is
issued,
there
is
no
law...
there
is
no
physical
intrusion
of
the
sort
that
this
court
has
ever
found
allows
lesser
included--
mr.
paul
rosenberg
--well,
because
the...
the
right
to
make
the
greater
intrusion,
for
purposes
of
the
fourth
amendment,
is
a
hypothetical
situation.
no
arrest
was
made
and
that
is
the
key
point
in
this
case
in
terms
of
the
fourth
amendment.
mr.
paul
rosenberg
i
have
conceded
that
an
arrest
could
have
been
made...
made
for
the
traffic
offense,
but
an
arrest
wasn't
made.
a
citation
was
issued.
mr.
paul
rosenberg
because...
and
i
would
refer
to
united
states...
whren
v.
the
united
states,
that
the
fourth
amendment
is
concerned
with
the
actual
events
and
not
those
events
which
could
have
happened
or
normally
would
have
happened.
it's
sort
of
the
reverse
argument
that
was
made
in
whren.
there
the
defendants
tried
to
rely
on
the
fact
that
normally,
police...
these
vice
officers
would
not
have
made
this
arrest,
and
therefore,
they
should
be
the
beneficiaries
of
this
hypothetical
situation.
the
other
side
of
the
coin
is
that
the
state
should
not
be
allowed
to
be
the
beneficiary
of
an
intrusion
in
lesser...
in
lesser
included
smaller
intrusions
that
in
fact
never
occurred.
mr.
paul
rosenberg
i
don't
believe
that
those
specific
examples
were
brought
up
in
briefing
to
the
iowa
supreme
court.
mr.
paul
rosenberg
every
traffic
offense
in
iowa
is
an
arrestable
offense,
and
therefore
every
traffic
offense
in
iowa,
for
which
somebody
is
cited,
is
the
basis
for
a
full
search
of
their
person
and
vehicle--
mr.
paul
rosenberg
--no.
mr.
paul
rosenberg
but
most
traffic
citations
are...
produce
no
need
to
look
for
evidence.
but
i
would
like
to
say
this,
if
there
is
such
a
citation
that
would
necessarily
involve
evidence
or
a
need
to
look
for
evidence,
then
that
particular
search
could
be
governed
under
the
carroll
decision,
simply
that
the
officer
has
probable
cause
to
believe
that
an
offense
has
occurred
and
probable
cause
that
there
may
be
evidence
in
the
car.
and
that
search
could
be
justified
under
existing
doctrine.
but
your
typical
traffic
offense
does
not
involve
any
evidence
other
than
what
the
officer
has
acquired
already.
mr.
paul
rosenberg
that's
correct.
but
all
offenses--
mr.
paul
rosenberg
--no.
those
are
arrestable
offenses
too.
the
iowa--
mr.
paul
rosenberg
--yes.
mr.
paul
rosenberg
because
the
iowa
supreme
court
recently--
mr.
paul
rosenberg
--yes,
they
are.
and
that's
why
we're
here.
[laughter]
this
law
applies
to
municipal
offenses
the
iowa
supreme
court
has
held
recently
in
state
v.--
mr.
paul
rosenberg
--yes.
mr.
paul
rosenberg
absolutely,
but
once
again
those
searches
would
be
justified
under
existing
reasonableness...
reasonable
searches
out
of
this
court,
carroll,
or
any
of
the
other--
mr.
paul
rosenberg
--i
would
think
so
because,
you
know,
that
offense
would
likely
involve
the
possession
of
recently
stolen
property.
mr.
paul
rosenberg
no,
no,
no.
mr.
paul
rosenberg
i
have
to
say
no.
[laughter]
that's
correct.
and
that...
that
would
be
because
the
citation
itself
does
not
give
rise
to
the
justification.
mr.
paul
rosenberg
yes.
mr.
paul
rosenberg
well,
the
probable
cause
would
be
needed
for
both
the
arrest
and
the
search,
and
generally
for
a
traffic
citation,
it
will
only
supply
the...
the
justification
for
the
arrest.
mr.
paul
rosenberg
right.
mr.
paul
rosenberg
i'm
not
aware
that
they
do
it.
it's
a
theoretical
position.
mr.
paul
rosenberg
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i'd
like
to
reserve
my
remaining
time
for
rebuttal.
thank
you.
mr.
paul
rosenberg
thank
you,
your
honor.
i
would
just
like
to
make
a
few
comments.
ms.
chambers
mentioned
that
the
officer
suspected
mr.
knowles
had
drugs.
the
officer,
although
he
may
have
suspected,
testified
at
the
suppression
hearing
that
he
had
no
cause,
no
suspicion,
that
mr.
knowles
had
any
drugs
on
him
on
this
occasion,
and
that
is
in
the
appendix.
the
second
response
i'd
like
to
make
regarding
the
enforcement
of
this
statute,
although
the
statute
was
passed
in
1983,
it
wasn't
until
about
1990
or
thereafter
that
the
iowa
supreme
court
gave
it
its
construction
and
anybody
had
any
idea
that
this
was
what
it
meant.
and
it
hasn't
been
enforced
much
because
a
lot
of
county
attorneys
have
been
advising
the
police
officers
not
to
rely
on
this
as
their
sole
basis
for
a
search
pending
their
belief
in
the...
that
it
may
be
overturned.
and
finally,
in
response
to
justice
ginsburg's
question
about
the
citizens
of
iowa
not
putting
up
with
this,
over
400,000
citizens
in
iowa
a
year
get
traffic
tickets.
if
this
policy
were
uniformly
and
nondiscriminatorily
enforced,
it...
the
right
to
arrest
would
be
ended.
the
legislature
would
end
it.
i
have
confidence
in
that.
this
policy
can
only
be
enforced...
the
statute
can
only
be
enforced
selectively,
otherwise
it
would
politically
not
be
stood
for
by
the
citizens
of
iowa,
and
that
in
fact
is
one
of
the
dangers
of
a
statute
like
this.
thank
you
very
much.
i'll
waive
the
additional
time.
