unknown
speaker
i'm
not
sure
that's
what
the
statute
does.
the
statute
says,
i
believe,
the
issuance
of
a
citation
in
lieu
of
arrest
or
in
lieu
of
continued
custody
does
not
affect
the
officer's
authority
to
conduct
an
otherwise
lawful
search.
so,
i
took
it
that
the
issue
was
whether
this
was
a
lawful
search,
not
whether
the
statute
said
there
can
be
a
full-blown
search.
i
thought
it
left
it
to
the
subsequent
determination
of
whether
the
search
was
lawful.
now,
in
this
case,
the
iowa
court
said
that
a
full
search
was
lawful
but,
in
the
course
of
that,
seemed
to
rely,
at
least
in
part,
on
federal
law
under
the
fourth
amendment.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
thought
what
the
court
below
did
was
to
say
that
a
full
search
on
the
occasion
of
a
traffic
citation
was
lawful
in
their
view.
isn't
that
what
happened?
unknown
speaker
yes.
it
isn't
that
the
statute
requires
that
result.
they
said
that
kind
of
a
search
is
lawful.
so,
i
guess
what
we
have
to
decide
is
whether
under
the
federal
constitution
that's
correct.
unknown
speaker
mr.
rosenberg,
could
you
just
back
up
for
a
minute
because
in
your
answer
to
justice
o'connor,
you
said
something
that
i
didn't
understand
you
had
challenged.
that
is,
i
didn't
understand
that
you
had
contested
the
authority
to
make
a
full
custodial
arrest
for
speeding.
you
had
only
contested
that
if
they
don't
and
they
merely
give
him
a
citation,
then
they
can't
search.
but
i
hadn't
realized
that
you
had
raised
the
question
that
justice
stewart
left
over
in
the
gustafson
case,
which
was
whether
you
could
have
constitutionally
a
full
arrest
for
a
traffic
violation.
where
did
you
raise
that
question?
unknown
speaker
well,
then
your
answer
to
justice
o'connor
was
not
right
because
she
asked
you
if
you
were
contesting
the
authority
to
make
a
full
custodial
arrest
on
the
basis
of
a
traffic
violation,
and
you
said
you
were.
but
i
understood
that
you
were
not,
that
you
were
making
a
more
limited
challenge,
that
is,
if...
assuming
they
could
make
a
full
custodial
arrest,
they
didn't.
all
they
did
was
issue
a
citation.
having
done
just
a
citation,
they
cannot
engage
in...
in
a
full
search.
unknown
speaker
arrest
and
make
a
full
custodial...
make
a
full
search.
unknown
speaker
so,
all
that
we're
talking
about
is
if
they
don't
exercise
that
authority,
authority
you're
not
challenging,
and
merely
issue
a
citation,
can
they
nonetheless
go
ahead.
so,
that's
what
we're
talking
about.
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
it's...
it's
clear
that
a
stop
or
a
traffic
offense
committed
in
the
officer's
presence
is
not
an
arrest?
unknown
speaker
is
that
clear?
unknown
speaker
is
the
person
free
to
leave?
unknown
speaker
handcuffs
are
required?
unknown
speaker
well,
would
you
agree
then
if
the
officer
made
the
valid
stop
and
exercised
the...
the
option,
which...
which
it
is
understood
i
think
clearly
that
he
has,
to
require
the
driver
to
get
out
of
the
car,
the
officer
at
that
point
could
at
least
have...
have
gone
to...
to
the...
to
the
point
of
a
terry
kind
of
pat-down
search?
do
you...
do
you
concede
that?
unknown
speaker
no.
he's...
well,
we
assume
that
it's
a
valid
stop
for
a
traffic
violation,
and
we
assume
that
he
has
ordered
the
person
out
of
the
car
so
that
the
driver
is
standing
right
in
front
of
him.
could
he
not
then
have...
have
conducted
a
terry
pat-down
without
more?
unknown
speaker
okay.
that
would
be
regardless
of
any
suspicion
caused
by
the
appearance
of
the
person
or
bulge
in
his
waist
or
something
like
that?
unknown
speaker
that's
why
i
don't
understand
your
response
to
justice
souter.
i...
don't
you
think
that
the
mere
fact
that
the
person
was
speeding
creates
such
an
articulable
reason
why
you
have
to
search
the
person?
unknown
speaker
then
your
answer
to
me
should
have
been
different,
shouldn't
it?
shouldn't
you
have
said,
no,
he
does
not
have
the
basis
for
a
terry
pat-down?
unknown
speaker
well,
you've...
you
have
conceded
that
he
could
have
been
arrested,
and
what
is
it
under
iowa
law
that
it
takes,
you
said,
handcuffs
going
to
the
station?
is
that
necessary?
suppose
the
officer
had
just
said,
i'm
placing
you
under
arrest,
and
he
said
those
words
before
he
searched
the
driver
and
the
passenger
and
the
inside
of
the
car.
suppose
he
said,
you're
under
arrest,
and
then
he
conducted
the
search.
unknown
speaker
so,
the
whole
thing
turns
on
whether
the
officer
says
you're
under...
you're
under
arrest
or
here's
a
ticket.
unknown
speaker
then
what
happened
to
the
handcuffs
and
the
station?
i'm
trying
to
determine
what
constitutes
an
arrest
under
iowa
law,
and
if
all
it
takes
is
the
words,
you're
under
arrest,
then
it's
a
different
case
than
if
you
have
to
go
through
quite
an...
an
involved
procedure
to
effect
the
arrest.
unknown
speaker
well,
then
you're
giving
a
different
answer
to
the
one
you
gave
before
when
i
asked
you,
is
it
enough
that
the
officer
says,
you're
under
arrest.
this
is...
the
officer
says,
you're
under
arrest.
he
then
searches
the
car,
finds
whatever
was
found
here,
a
small
bit
of
marijuana,
a
pipe,
then
brings
the
person
who
he
has
already
told
you're
under
arrest
down
to
the
station
house.
unknown
speaker
your
basic
argument
here,
as...
as
i
understand
it,
is
that
while
there
is
a
justification
for
a
full
search
when
you
have
an
arrest,
take
the
person
into
custody,
the...
as
we
said
in...
in
robinson,
those
facts
are
not
present
when
you
simply
issue
a
citation.
unknown
speaker
suppose
the
police
officer
said,
look
it,
i'm
entitled
to
arrest
you
and
take
you
to
the
station,
and
i'm
not
going
to
do
that.
i'm
just
going
to
give
you
a
citation
if
you
let
me
search
the
car.
unknown
speaker
well,
if
the
officer
had
the
right
to
take
him
into
custody,
why
couldn't
he
give
him
that
choice?
unknown
speaker
mr.
rosenberg,
you...
you
pointed
out
that
historically
the
distinction
seems
to
have
been
recognized
between
searches
incident
to
arrest
and
the
consequences
of
a
mere
citation.
why?
what
is
it
about
the
arrest,
assuming
that
a
valid
arrest
is
made,
that
justifies
the
search
that
doesn't
justify
it
in
the
non-custodial
situation?
unknown
speaker
of
course,
that's
just
one
of
the
justifications
that
it
would
express.
the
other
one
is
to
obtain...
obtain
necessary
evidence.
isn't...
isn't
that
another
justification
that's
been
alluded
to
besides
protecting
the...
the
officer?
unknown
speaker
i
mean,
if
he's
arresting
somebody
outside
the
car,
why
should
he
be
able
to
search
the
inside
of
the
car?
just
keep
the
guy
outside
the
car.
he
can
search
the
inside
of
the
car
in
the
case
of
an
arrest
to
obtain
necessary
evidence--
unknown
speaker
--could
i
ask
you,
in
your...
in
your
researches
on
the
common
law,
did
the
common
law
draw
a
distinction
between
a...
what
you've
called
a
custodial
arrest
and
a
non-custodial
arrest?
would
the
common
law
have
considered
the...
the
stop
of
the
car
an
arrest?
i
mean,
the
policeman
is
telling
you,
go
no
further.
if
you
go
further,
you
know,
you
will
be
in
violation
of
the
of
the
law,
and
i
will
use
force
to
stop
you.
is
that...
would
the
common
law
consider
that
an
arrest?
unknown
speaker
i
think
you
mistook
my
question.
i
guess
i'm
really
asking
whether
in
the
common
law
all
seizures
of
the
person
were
not
considered
arrests.
is
it
clear
that
there
were
two
categories
of
seizures
of
the
person,
one
of
which
was
just,
you
know,
a
temporary
traffic
stop
and
another
one
was
what
you
call
a
full
custodial
arrest?
unknown
speaker
well,
if
that's
the
case,
then...
then...
and
if
it
didn't,
then
the
long
history
of...
of
allowing
searches
of
this
sort
only
in
connection
with
an
arrest
could
be
a
long
history
of
allowing
searches
in
connection
with
a
traffic
stop,
whether
you
give
a
citation
or
not.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
guess
we
didn't
have
a
lot
of
cars
and
trucks
back
in
the
1600's
and
the
1700's.
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
if
we
move
forward
from
the
common
law
to
cases
decided
by
this
court,
berkemer
against
mccarty
you
cite
in
your
brief
i
guess
for
the
proposition
that
a
traffic
stop
is
not
an
arrest.
unknown
speaker
that
was
a
clarification?
unknown
speaker
i
assume--
unknown
speaker
--that
was
justice
powell's
argument
in...
in
robinson.
i'm
not
sure
that
i
understand
it
because
if
there
is
a
right
to
make
the
greater
intrusion,
why
isn't
there
the
right
to
make
the
lesser...
his
argument,
as
i
understand
it,
was
just
as
you
have
said,
that
once
you've
arrested,
the
search
is
just
kind
of
de
minimis.
i
mean,
there's
nothing
much
left
for
him
to
object
to
when
his
body
is
subject
to
custody.
and
that's
true.
but
i
don't
know
whether
it
really
goes
to
the
issue
because
if
there
is
a
right
to
make
the
greater
intrusion,
why
isn't
there
a
right
to
make
the
lesser
intrusion?
unknown
speaker
no,
but
you...
maybe
i
misunderstand
you.
i
thought
you
had
conceded
that
an
arrest
could
have
been
made
here.
it
would
have
been
a
lawful
arrest.
unknown
speaker
no,
but
if...
but
my
question
is,
if
the...
if
the
right
to
commit
to
the
greater
intrusion,
the
arrest,
is
assumed,
why
doesn't
it
follow
that
there
is
a
right
to
commit
to
the
lesser
intrusion,
which
is
the
mere
search?
unknown
speaker
mr.
rosenberg,
in
your...
you
made
some
rather
graphic
comparisons
in...
in...
in
your
briefing
in
some
of
the
others
that
if
you
say
every
citation
can
trigger
a...
a
full
custodial
search,
then
the
jaywalker
is
in
danger,
the
person
who's
walking
a
dog
without
a
leash.
i
mean,
were
these
examples
brought
up
to
the
iowa
supreme
court,
to
say
that
every
citation
for
every
petty
offense
can
yield
a
search
that
will
turn
up
something
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
offense?
unknown
speaker
because
there
is
no
limit
in
iowa,
as
i
understand
it.
everything...
every
traffic
violation...
you
don't
signal
and
you
can
be
arrested.
unknown
speaker
do
you
count
driving
under
the
influence
as
a
traffic
offense?
unknown
speaker
because
there,
it
seems
to
me,
the
officer
might
have
a
reason
akin
to
those
given
in
robinson
for
wanting
to
search
for
more
evidence,
but
it
seems
to
me
also
that
with
speeding,
the
offense
is
complete
in
a
sense
when
the
car
is
brought
to
a
stop,
and
you're
not
going
to
find
anything
inside
the
car
that
is
going
to
help
you
prove
the
person
has
been
speeding.
unknown
speaker
and
if
i
understand
it
correctly,
it's
not
the
state
law
that...
that...
that
you
can
search
whenever
you
issue
a
citation.
it's
only
the
state
law
that
you
can
search
whenever
you
issue
a
citation
instead
of
arresting
when
there
is
an
offense
that...
that
permits
arrest.
unknown
speaker
so,
walking
a
dog,
failing
to
curb
your
dog
and
some
of
those
other
examples
really...
would
they
be
a
problem
under
iowa
law?
unknown
speaker
they
are
arrestable
for
failure
to
curb
your
dog?
unknown
speaker
wow.
unknown
speaker
they're
tough
out
there--
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
and
it
goes
up
too,
does
it
not?
at
least
the...
the
ability
to
substitute
a
citation
for
an
arrest
goes
up
to
second
degree
burglary.
unknown
speaker
there
i
suppose
there
might
be
a
reason
to
search
that
you
wouldn't
have
in
the
case
of
speeding.
unknown
speaker
well,
would
you
say
that
if
you're
cited
for
second
degree
burglary
and
not
arrested
that
there
is
a
right
to
search,
let's
say,
the
vehicle
if
the
vehicle
was
stopped
and
the
citation
is
issued
for
second
degree
burglary?
unknown
speaker
well,
let's
assume
that
there's
no...
no
probable
cause
to...
to
believe
that
there's
burglary
tools
or
the
fruits
of
a
crime
in
the
car.
could
the
officer
incident
to
the
citation
for
burglary
search
the
car
without
more?
i'm
surprised
you're
conceding
that.
unknown
speaker
your
answer
is
no.
unknown
speaker
well,
it
gives
rise
to
one
of
the
justifications
advanced
in
robinson,
doesn't
it,
the...
the
need
to
search
for
evidence?
unknown
speaker
plus
the
fact
i
suppose
to
issue
the
citation,
they
had
to
have
probable
cause,
and
if
they
just
got
probable
cause
right
at
the
moment,
that
would
include
probable
cause
to
search
the
vehicle
i
suppose.
unknown
speaker
the
need
for...
for...
for
searching
for
evidence
justification
that
the
chief
justice
referred
to
would
be...
would
be
taken
care
of
by
the
probable
cause,
by
the
presence
of
probable
cause.
if
there
is
indeed
need
to
search
for
evidence,
you
have
probable
cause
and
you
don't
have
to
rely
on
the
arrestability
of
the
offense.
right?
unknown
speaker
and
so,
the
only
justification
we're
talking
about
is
the
need
to
keep
yourself
safe.
i
don't
think
you
should
issue
citations
to
burglars
anyway.
do
you
know
if
they've
ever
done
that?
unknown
speaker
writing...
do
they
ever
just
give
them
a
warning?
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
very
well,
mr.
rosenberg.
ms.
chambers,
we'll
hear
from
you.
unknown
speaker
may
i
just
be
sure
that
you
agree
with
what
your
opponent
said
on
the
scope
of
the
citation?
this
includes
something
like
jaywalking?
unknown
speaker
and
therefore
your...
so,
it
does--
unknown
speaker
--because
you
could
arrest
him
for
jaywalking.
unknown
speaker
and
therefore,
if
there...
if
somebody
jaywalks,
the
police
could
search
him.
unknown
speaker
and
that
would
include
a
strip
search.
i
mean,
when
you're
arrested,
you
could
be
subject
to
strip
search.
unknown
speaker
a
strip
search
for
jaywalking?
unknown
speaker
but
your
argument
is
there
would
be
no
constitutional
objection
to
a
strip
search
for
a
traffic
citation.
unknown
speaker
do
you
acknowledge
that
the
rule
you're
asking
us
to
confirm
today,
the
iowa
opinion,
is
an
extension
of
our
previous
cases?
unknown
speaker
well--
--well,
is
this
an
extension
of
our
prior
cases?
unknown
speaker
well,
but
cupp
v.
murphy
certainly
didn't
speak
in
terms
of
a
broad
right
to
conduct
searches
even
with
the
presence
of
probable
cause.
unknown
speaker
well,
your...
there's
no
reason
to
expect
evidence
to
be
produced
by
virtue
of
this
search
of
the
traffic
violation,
is
there?
unknown
speaker
really.
unknown
speaker
how
can
you
say
that
at
the
point
that
the
decision
is
made
to
issue
the
citation?
i
mean,
the...
at
that
point,
the
individual
has
presumably
produced
a
driver's
license
or
whatever
identification
is.
if
that
isn't
so,
the
officer
isn't
going
to
let
him
go
with
a
citation.
unknown
speaker
well,
would
the
officer
let
him
go
with
a...
with
a
citation
if
he
didn't
have
any
identification?
surely
not.
he
wouldn't
know
who
to
write
in
the
citation.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
think
you're...
i
don't
know
whether
that's...
i'm
from
a
small
town
too.
[laughter]
and
i...
i'm
not
ready
i
think
to
concede
that
your
example
is
much
of
a
real
world
example,
but
assuming...
assuming
it
is,
wouldn't
it
make
more
sense
for
us
simply
to
say,
in
order
to
keep
our
kind
of...
not
only
our
constitutional
categories
but
our
constitutional
protections
intact,
to
say
that
in
that
case
it's
better
for
the
officer
to
make
the
custodial
arrest
and
to
justify
any
search
on
that
basis
than
to
consider
broadening
the
scope
of
the
so-called
search
incident
exception
to
include
a...
a
citation
for...
for
any
kind
of
misdemeanor
or
traffic
violation
even?
wouldn't
it
make
more
sense
to
say,
look,
if
that's
your
problem,
go
ahead
and
arrest
him
and
then
we
all
know
where
we
stand?
unknown
speaker
okay,
but
that
goes
back
to
another
one
of
the
justifications
in
robinson.
one
was
the
evidentiary
justification
that
you
referred
to
and
the
other
one,
which
we've
already
heard
about
this
morning,
is
the
justification
of
protecting
the
officer
and
in
fact
making
good
on
the
arrest
that...
that
is
made.
i
don't
see
how
that
can
apply
here
because,
as
i
understand
the
facts,
the
point
at
which
the
decision
to
cite
is
announced
is,
in
effect,
the
end
of
the
encounter.
the
officer
says,
i'm
not
going
to
arrest
you.
i'm
going
to
give
you
this
citation
instead.
the
fear
for
police
safety
is,
i
would
suppose,
at
a
minimum
in
that
case,
whereas
it
is
at
a
maximum
when
an
arrest
is
made.
so,
why...
why
isn't
robinson
against
you?
unknown
speaker
but
it's...
but
it's
not.
i
mean,
we're
talking
about...
i
presume
we're
talking
about
the
case
that
we've
got
here
in
which
there
isn't
any
search
until
the
encounter
to
the...
to
the
point
of
issuing
the
citation
is
over
and
then
the
officer
says,
and
by
the
way,
i'm
going
to
search
your
car.
unknown
speaker
well,
can
infer
that
the
officer
always
intended
to
make
the
search
because
he
was
relying
on
state
law
and
he
realized
that
he
might
very
well
want
some
extra
protection
while
he
was
searching
a
car.
but
that
sort
of
begs
the
question
here
because
the...
the...
the
officer
protection
justification
in
robinson
is
a
justification
for
protecting
the
officer
when
he
has
an
individual
in
the...
in
arrest...
in
custody
following
an
arrest.
and
that
by
definition
is
what
we
don't
have
here.
so,
it
seems
to
me
that
whether
your
argument
ultimately
prevails
or
not,
we
would
certainly
have
to
extend
robinson
in
order
to
see
it
your
way
here.
unknown
speaker
i
was
going
to...
go
ahead.
unknown
speaker
well,
but
that's
because--
unknown
speaker
--robinson
said
we're
going
to
establish
general
rules.
unknown
speaker
okay.
unknown
speaker
but...
but
in
a
way
you...
you
would
be
going
beyond
robinson
here
because
you're
saying
that
there's
an
authority
to
search
that
would
not
be
the
same
basis
as
was
set
forth
in
robinson.
when
you
have
a
traffic
stop,
you're
not
going
to
find
any
additional
evidence
of
speeding
by
searching
either
the
person
or
their
car,
and
the
safety
situation
is...
is
simply
not
as
great
when
you
issue
a
citation
as
it
is
when
you
have
a
formal
arrest.
unknown
speaker
and
the
officer
has
it
his
power
under
iowa
law
to
obviate
at
least
a
part
of
that
danger
by
making
a
custodial
arrest.
unknown
speaker
how
many
other
states
have
a
policy
like
iowa's?
i...
i
haven't
been
able
to
uncover
more
than
perhaps
arkansas.
unknown
speaker
are
these
all
states
that
say
that
any...
all
these
traffic
offenses...
that
all
of
those
are
subject
to
full
custodial
arrest?
unknown
speaker
i'm
asking
you
about
how
many
are
like
iowa
because,
frankly,
it
startled
to
me
to
think
that...
that
a
police
officer
could
make
a
full
custodial
arrest
for
the
pettiest
infraction.
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
another
question
about
the
routine
procedure
that
police
follow?
is
it
not
correct
that
normally,
when
a
custodial
arrest
is
made,
the
officers
have
a
procedure
they
follow
which
would
include
a
rather
complete
search
to
be
sure
there
are
no
weapons
around,
whereas
normally
in
the
citation
situation,
unless
they
go
ahead
and
arrest,
they
do
not
conduct
a
search?
unknown
speaker
in
the
states
except
for
iowa.
but
now,
with
iowa's
statute
on
the
books,
i
suppose
in
iowa
now
the
police
are
routinely
making
searches
in
these
situations?
unknown
speaker
so
that
now
that...
if...
if
we
affirm
the
iowa
court,
presumably
the
practice
would
become
much
more
prevalent.
unknown
speaker
doesn't
that
also
indicate
that
the
iowa
officers
do
not
consider
it,
in
the
usual
case,
necessary
to
search
in
order
to
protect
the
officer?
unknown
speaker
but...
but
you're
asking
us
to
have...
have
a
rule
which
presumes
that
there's
a
danger
to
the
officer.
i
suppose
that's
the
basis
for
your
rule.
unknown
speaker
but
that
presumption
doesn't
accord
with
the
facts
even
as
iowa
officers
now
understand.
unknown
speaker
ms.
chambers,
there's
another
side
to
this
too
because
the
person
who's
apprehended,
if
in
fact
there's
arrest,
there's
a
warning
light
that
will
go
off
because
that
person
will
get
a
miranda
warning.
but
here...
your
argument
is
very
appealing
when
you
say,
if
the
greater,
then
the
lesser;
if
the
full
arrest,
then
the
citation.
but
the
other
part
of
it
is
the
defendant
who
gets
a
traffic
ticket
doesn't
have
any
idea
that
that's
the
kind
of
situation
he
faces,
where
if
there's
a
full
custodial
arrest,
he
must
be
given
his
miranda
warnings.
so,
the...
it's
a
pretty
good
situation
for
the
police.
unknown
speaker
it
does
seem
an
enormous
amount
of
authority
to
put
into
the
hands
of
the
police.
as
you
said,
you
have
to
leave
it
to
the
judgment
and
the
police
will
exercise
good
judgment.
but
that's...
we
do
have
constitutional
checks
because
we're
not
always
so
sure
that...
that
the
police
will
exercise
good
judgment.
unknown
speaker
but
it's
a
lot
of
trouble
not
just
for
the...
not
just
for
the
suspect
but
for
the
officer
and
for
the
system
to
arrest
somebody.
unknown
speaker
and
it's
a
deterrent
against
conducting...
conducting
searches
where
there
is
genuinely
no
reason
to
conduct
a
search.
yes,
you
can
do
it
if
you
arrest,
but
you...
you
have
to
do
the
paperwork.
unknown
speaker
police
don't
like
to
do
paperwork
i
gather
from
watching
television
movies.
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
they
don't
like
to
do--
unknown
speaker
--excuse
me.
they
can
arrest,
search,
and
then
say
never
mind
the
arrest?
unknown
speaker
wow.
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
i
really
only
did
this
arrest
so
i
could
search.
i've
done
the
search.
here's
a
citation.
unknown
speaker
let's
forget
about
it.
unknown
speaker
that's
not
entirely
true,
i
don't
think,
ms.
chambers.
i
think
if
there
were
reasons
simply
by
looking
at
the
person
in
the
car
to...
to
feel
that
he
was
armed
or
anything,
i
think
you'd
have
the
authority
to
search
under
terry
without
needing
to
rely
on
the
custodial
arrest
doctrine.
unknown
speaker
and
what
evidence
do
you
need
to...
to
search
for
when
you've
stopped
a
person
for
speeding?
unknown
speaker
if
you'd
come
here
on
second
burglary,
it
might
have
been
different.
unknown
speaker
actually
in
this
case,
he
knew
the
defendant.
unknown
speaker
he
knew
that
he
was
knowles
when
he
stopped...
before
he
stopped
him.
unknown
speaker
and
under
whren,
we
said
there's
no
such
thing
as
a
pretextual
search.
the
fact
that
he
thought
there
might
be
drugs
doesn't
counsel
against
the
reasonableness
of
the
arrest.
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
you
about
your
statement,
requires
initiation
of
prosecution?
i
know
i've
been
stopped
and
the
officer...
well,
he
gave
me
a
lecture
and
i
had
a
warning.
and
sometimes
they
may
stop,
intending
initially
to
give
a
citation,
and
then
they
figure
it's
a...
it's
a...
some
unusual
excuse.
the
speedometer
wasn't
working
or
something,
and...
and
they
decide
later
to
just
give
a
warning.
in
iowa,
if
they
stop,
must
they
give
a
citation?
unknown
speaker
they
could
give
a
warning.
unknown
speaker
could
they
give
a
warning
after
initially
arresting
the
person?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
they
could...
so,
in
other
words,
they
could
arrest,
search,
find
nothing,
and
then
say,
well,
i'll
just
give
you
a
warning.
unknown
speaker
they
could.
unknown
speaker
could...
could
they
arrest...
under
justice
stevens'
hypothetical,
could
they
arrest,
search,
then
give
a
warning,
if
the
arrest
were
simply
a
pretext
for
a
search
and
they
had
no
intention
at
the
time
of
arrest
of
doing
anything
other
but
giving
a
warning?
unknown
speaker
absent
finding
something.
unknown
speaker
could
the...
could
the...
could
the
officer
arrest,
having
the
intention
at
all
times
simply
of
giving
a
warning?
could
he
arrest
simply
in
order
to
effect
the
search?
unknown
speaker
well,
but
you
were
the
one
that
said
we
have
the
right
for
a
lot--
unknown
speaker
--well,
it's
not...
it's
not...
it's
not
a
pretext.
it's...
it's...
it's
an
instance
in
which
the
officer's
objective
actions
really
are...
are...
do
not
disclose
his
true
purpose.
unknown
speaker
i
don't
understand
why
it
would
require
that.
you
say
it
would
require
initiation
of
prosecution,
but
how
can
that
be
so
if
the
officer
would
have
authority
to
make
the
arrest
because
the
guy
was
speeding,
and
then
he...
he
makes
the
search,
and
he
says,
i
don't
think
i
want
to
write
up
a
ticket.
i'll
just
give
him
a
warning.
what
would
prevent
him
from
doing
that?
unknown
speaker
yes,
and
i
know
you
say
that,
that
it
would...
that's
the
rule
you
propose,
but
it
seems
to
me
that
if
we
adopted
the
rule
you
propose,
there
would
be
nothing
to
prevent
the
officer
from
conducting
all
the
searches
he
wants
to
and
simply
giving
warnings
whenever
he
finds
nothing
and
going
ahead
with
the
prosecution
whenever
he
finds
something.
that
could
happen
under
your
rule.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
there
was
a
point...
there
was
a
point,
ms.
chambers,
made
in
response
to
that.
and
you
said,
yes,
it's
so,
but
maybe
the
good
citizens
of
iowa
would
be
a
little
upset
if
they
get
arrested
every
time
they
forget
to
signal
when
they're
turning.
unknown
speaker
well,
you...
you...
the
usual
rule
is
there
can
be
a
search
incident
to
an
arrest.
you
want
to
turn
it
around
and
have
an
arrest
incident
to
a
search.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
that's
an
abuse
of
authority.
unknown
speaker
if
the
officer
arrests
not
intending
really
to
arrest,
that's
an
abuse
of
authority.
you're
not
really
proposing
that
this
could
happen,
are
you?
unknown
speaker
but
the
answer
to
that
is
that
officers
are
going
to
use
some
judgment
and
they're
only
going
to
use
this
power
when
they
think,
well,
i'm
not
sure
this
fellow
doesn't
look
just
a
little
bit
suspicious.
he
was
a
little
nasty
in
my
conversation.
i
mean,
they
could
have
the
authority
without
using
it
in
every
case.
unknown
speaker
or
better
yet,
they
might
save
it
for
out-of-state
motorists.
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
but
arrest
is
an
objective
thing.
unknown
speaker
thank
you,
ms.
chambers.
mr.
rosenberg,
you
have
2
minutes
remaining.
unknown
speaker
the
honorable
court
is
now
adjourned
until
tomorrow
at
ten
o'clock.
