mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
1983,
iowa
passed
a
statute
which
allowed
officers
to
use
citations
for
almost
any
offense.
at
the
same
time,
the
iowa
legislature
authorized...
stated
that...
that
when
a
citation
is
issued,
officers
may
still
search
and
make
any
otherwise
lawful
search.
patrick
knowles
challenges
that
statute
as
it
applies
to
the
search
of
his
car
made
after
he
was
issued
a
speeding
ticket.
the
concerns
raised
by
petitioner
in
this
case
are
met
by
the
fact
that
the
iowa
statute
requires
probable
cause
to
arrest
in
every
case
where
a
search
is
made.
it's
probable
cause
to
arrest
which
makes
it
both
to
arrest
and
issuance
of
a
citation
reasonable
under
the
fourth
amendment.
it's
probable
cause
to
arrest--
ms.
bridget
a.
chambers
--in
iowa,
almost
every
ordinance--
ms.
bridget
a.
chambers
--it
does,
generally,
yes.
ms.
bridget
a.
chambers
correct.
ms.
bridget
a.
chambers
correct,
because
they
could
make
a
custodial
arrest
and
search
incident
thereto.
ms.
bridget
a.
chambers
no.
it--
ms.
bridget
a.
chambers
--no.
in
iowa,
there
clearly
could
not
be
a
strip
search
for
two
reasons.
first
of
all,
iowa
has
a
specific
statute
that
deals
with
that,
and
it
is
805.3
i
believe...
804.3,
and
that
statute
specifically
says
that
for
scheduled
traffic
violations
or
simple
misdemeanors,
which
would
include
ordinance
violations--
ms.
bridget
a.
chambers
--no.
that's
the
second
prong
of
our
answer,
and
clearly
under
this
court's
prior
decisions
in
the
context
of
search
incident
to
custodial
arrests,
a
strip
search
can
only
be
made
under
certain
very
carefully
restricted
circumstances
which
i
cannot
conceive
could
exist
in
the
context
of
a
jaywalking
or...
or
other
city
ordinance
violation.
it's
probable
cause
to
arrest
which
also
prevents
random
suspicion-less
searches
which
were
a
major
part
of
the
petitioner's
brief
in
this
case.
ms.
bridget
a.
chambers
the...
it's
the
state's
position
that
in
interpreting
iowa
code
section
805.1(4),
the
iowa
court
simply
says
that
statute
authorizes
whatever
the
fourth
amendment
authorizes
and
then
went
on
to
decide
that
the
fourth
amendment
does
authorize
search
incident
to
citation.
so,
yes.
ms.
bridget
a.
chambers
we
think
it's...
it's
certainly
an
issue
that
hasn't
been
decided
before.
it's
the
state's
position
that
it's
not
an
extension
of
your
prior
opinions
because
such
searches
always
require
probable
cause
to
arrest
and--
ms.
bridget
a.
chambers
--right.
it's
the
state's
position
that
you
must
have
both
probable
cause
to
arrest
and
initiation
of
a
prosecution
in
some
manner.
that
we
believe
is
consistent
with
the
court's
prior
opinions.
in
cupp
v.
murphy,
the
difference
is
that
in
that
situation,
although
there
was
probable
cause
to
arrest,
there
was
not
any
kind
of
an
initiation
of
a
prosecution.
there
were
no
charges
filed
whether
custodial
arrest
or
by
citation.
no
prosecution
had
been
initiated.
so,
given
that
particular
circumstance,
the
court
simply
said
the
exigencies
that
exist
in
this
case,
cupp,
do
not
give
rise
to
the
kinds
of
concerns
that
arise
when
a
prosecution
is
initiated,
that
is,
escape
or
destruction
of
evidence
and
that
because
there
is
no
prosecution--
ms.
bridget
a.
chambers
--the
state
does
not
concede
that
point,
your
honor--
ms.
bridget
a.
chambers
--for
a
couple
of
reasons.
first
of
all,
if
the
context
is
speeding,
certainly
we
wouldn't
be
looking
for
the
kinds
of
broad
ranging
evidence
that
we
might
look
for
in
a
burglary
case,
for
example.
but
certainly
identity
is
always
at
issue
in
any
case,
and
that's--
ms.
bridget
a.
chambers
--it's
certainly
true
that
the...
the
person
will
likely
have
produced
some
kind
of
identification.
ms.
bridget
a.
chambers
right,
likely
not.
two
things
are
true
then,
your
honor.
if
the
officer
can't
search...
if
the
officer
has
any
doubts
about
whether
that...
that
identification
is
valid
or
if
the
person
can't
produce
acceptable
identification,
then
the
officer
will
likely
make
a
custodial
arrest
when
he
might
not
if
he
could
search.
let
me
give
you
an
example.
it's
not
at
all
uncommon
for
an
officer
to
stop
someone,
and
particularly
in
iowa
where
we're
dealing
with
rural
communities,
small
population,
to
stop
someone
and
have
that
person
say,
i
have
a
license.
i
simply
don't
have
it
with
me.
my
name
is
bob
jones.
i
live
at
308
elm
street.
the
officer
may
well
know
that
that
information
is
true
and
feel
comfortable
writing
a
citation,
and
because
they're
comfortable
with
the
identification,
the
officer
can...
can
make
the
necessary
records
checks
to
confirm
that
the
license
is
valid.
on
the
other
hand,
it
certainly
isn't
uncommon
for
suspects
to
misidentify
themselves
or
present
false
id's,
and
in
that
situation,
the
officer
who
has
some
doubts
about
that
identification
either
has
to
issue
a
citation
not
knowing
if
it's
being
issued
in
the
right
name,
or
has
to
make
a
custodial
arrest.
and
it
simply--
ms.
bridget
a.
chambers
--well,
of
course,
the
state's
second
response
to
the
issue
of
whether
there's
evidence
in
a...
in
a
speeding
case,
for
example,
is
that
in
gustafson
and
robinson,
the
court
said
because
such
a
search
is
reasonable,
we
don't
look
in
a
particular
case
to
see
whether
there
would,
in
fact,
be
evidence
or
weapons
to
search
for--
ms.
bridget
a.
chambers
--well,
certainly
one
would
normally
expect
that
a
search
based
on
a
concern
for
officer
safety
might
be
made
at
the
initiation
of
a
stop,
but
i
would
point
out
a
couple
of
things.
ms.
bridget
a.
chambers
correct.
it's...
it's
the
state's
position
that
officers
have
to
be
allowed
to
make
the
decision
for
themselves
what
best
serves
their
safety.
in
this
case,
the
officer
stopped
knowles,
kept
him
in
his
car
while
the
officer
wrote
the
citation.
the
officer
called
for
backup
and
at
the
point
at
which
a
backup
officer
arrived,
then
the
officer
issued
the
citation
and
made
the
search.
so,
one
can
infer
that
the
officer
kept
knowles
in
a
place
where
he
could
keep
him
at
least
partially
under
observation
until
an
officer
came
to
serve
as
backup
and
that
he
made--
ms.
bridget
a.
chambers
--if
by
extend
robinson,
the
court
means
apply
it
to
a
situation
where
the
officer
subjectively
did
not
fear
the
suspect,
then
the
state
does
not
agree
with
that
characterization
because
i
think
the
court
noted
in
robinson--
ms.
bridget
a.
chambers
--i
think
the
court
noted
in
robinson
that
that
officer
did
not
have
a
subjective
fear
of
the
defendant.
ms.
bridget
a.
chambers
certainly--
ms.
bridget
a.
chambers
--right.
ms.
bridget
a.
chambers
and
it's
the
state's
position
that
similarly
a
general
rule
should
be
established
in
this
context.
ms.
bridget
a.
chambers
we
certainly
agree
that
although
there
are
studies
that
say
that...
that
show
that
officers
are
not
objectively
able
to
accurately
predict
which
offenders
are
likely
to
be
dangerous
and
while
there
are...
are
statistics
that
indicate
that
traffic
offenders
do
pose
a
threat,
certainly
common
sense
would
tell
us
that
on
a
continuum
of
danger,
in
most
cases
most
offenders
are
less
likely
to
be
dangerous--
ms.
bridget
a.
chambers
--and...
and
that,
your
honor,
is
why
we...
we
make
the
statement
that
it's
not
really
an
extension
of
robinson
or
gustafson
because
in
every
case
where
the
officer
can
search
under
the
iowa
statute,
the
officer
can
already
make
a
custodial
arrest--
ms.
bridget
a.
chambers
--there
are
a
handful
of
states
who
either
by
rule,
statute,
or
judicial
decision
have
a
practice
similar
to
iowa's.
in
vermont,
the
state
v.
greenslit
case
which
is
cited
in
the
state's
brief.
florida
issued
a
decision
in
state
v.
mccray,
626
s.
2d
1017,
arkansas
in
the
state
v.
earl
decision,
970
s.w.
2d
789,
and
colorado
in
the--
ms.
bridget
a.
chambers
--colorado
makes
a
bit
of
a
distinction
in
that
there
they
were
dealing
with
a
statute...
an
offense
for
which
the
statute
specifically
prohibited
arrest,
and
so
some
of--
ms.
bridget
a.
chambers
--i'm
sorry.
i
misunderstood
the
question.
all...
most
states
do
and
depending
on
who
counts,
it
varies
between
25
and
30.
my
count
came
up
with
about
27
who
allow
it
in
virtually
every
circumstance.
almost
all
50
states
allow
it
in
certain
circumstances.
ms.
bridget
a.
chambers
that's
normal--
ms.
bridget
a.
chambers
--no.
actually,
your
honor,
although
the
statute
went
into
effect
in
1983,
this
practice
is
far
from
routine
for
a
couple
of
reasons.
i
think
one
could
infer
that
one
of
the
reasons
is
that
until
now
the
constitutionality
of
those
searches
were
some...
were
unsettled
and
cautious
prosecutors
were
likely
advising
cautious
law
enforcement
officials
to
exercise
a
great
deal
of
care
in
this
area.
ms.
bridget
a.
chambers
well,
certainly
as
one
would
expect
prior
to
belton,
there
were
probably
few
auto
searches
under
that...
that
doctrine.
prior
to
the
decision
in
this
case,
certainly
officers
are
exercising
caution.
but
secondly--
ms.
bridget
a.
chambers
--that's...
the
second
ground
is
that
i
think
that
officers
do
exercise
a
great
deal
of
discretion,
and...
and
are
careful
about
when
they
use
this.
ms.
bridget
a.
chambers
it's
certainly
one
of
the
two--
ms.
bridget
a.
chambers
--well,
certainly
just
as
the
law
currently
allows
custodial
arrest
and
search
in
every
situation,
which
is
unquestionably
constitutional
and
conceded
by...
by
knowles,
and
officers
currently
are
not
searching
in
all
those
cases,
they
would...
they
would
behave
presumably
similarly
under
search
incident
to
citation.
the...
the
fact
that
officers
exercise
discretion
certainly
doesn't
defeat
the
rule.
the
rule
presumes
that
it's
reasonable
under
the
fourth
amendment
because
of
concerns
with
preservation
of
error
and
officer
safety,
and
if
officers
subjectively
choose
not
to
go
to
the
limits
of
their
power,
the
state
believes
that
that's
a
proper
exercise
of
discretion.
ms.
bridget
a.
chambers
well,
of
course,
if
a
custodial
arrest,
miranda
would
only
have
to
be
made
if
the
officer
wished
to
interrogate.
so,
it's
not
necessarily
true
that
it
would
be
given
in
every
case.
but
if
the
question
is,
does
this
allow
officers
to
search
without
providing
those
protections
provided
by
arrest,
of
course,
the
answer
is
yes.
however--
ms.
bridget
a.
chambers
--but
taking
this
back
into
the...
a
practical
example,
the
officer
in
the
knowles
case
could
already
have
made
a
custodial
arrest
and
searched,
and
unless
the
officer
wished
to
interrogate
mr.
knowles,
he
would
not
have
been
required
to
give
a
miranda.
similarly,
an
officer
could
arrest
and,
under
iowa
law,
then
search
and
subsequently
release
the
person
on
citation
which
is
in
fact
the...
the
practice
advocated
by
the
american
bar
association
and
the
american
law
institute.
all
of
those
circumstances
are
functionally
identical
from
the
point
of
view
of
a
suspect.
it...
as
a
practical
matter,
it
matters
little
to
a
suspect
whether
the
officer
utters
the
words,
you're
under
arrest,
before
he
searches
and
releases.
for
those
reasons,
although
we
recognize
that...
that...
that
one
could
see
this
as
skirting
miranda,
for
example,
really
in
a
functional
manner
it
is
not.
ms.
bridget
a.
chambers
it
certainly
is.
ms.
bridget
a.
chambers
that
would--
ms.
bridget
a.
chambers
--we
will
certainly
concede
the
latter.
ms.
bridget
a.
chambers
that
would
be
true
if
it
were
not
for
the
fact
that
under
iowa
law
officers
can
arrest,
search,
and
then
subsequently
release
on
citation.
because
they
can
promptly
release
on
citation,
those...
those
practical
limits
that
might...
that
might
arise
don't--
ms.
bridget
a.
chambers
--yes.
ms.
bridget
a.
chambers
and
in
fact,
the
form
that
they
would
use--
ms.
bridget
a.
chambers
--well,
that's--
ms.
bridget
a.
chambers
--that's
certainly
one
take.
of
course,
the
state's
position
is
that
that
releasing
on
citation
allows
the
officer
to...
to
do
those
things
which
he
finds
necessary
to
confirm
the
identity,
investigate
the
crime,
obtain
any
evidence
necessary,
and
then
releases
the
suspect,
minimizing
the
amount
of
detention
required.
again,
i
would
point
out
that's
the
position
that
the
american
bar
association
and
the
american
law
institute
in
fact
advocate.
the
position
advanced
by
knowles
is...
is
really
one
that
is
counter-effective
in
terms
of
the
overall
protections
of
the
fourth
amendment.
he's
asking
the
court
to
require
that
a
custodial
arrest
be
made
in
any
case
where...
where
the
officer
wishes
to
search
to
protect
his
safety,
to
preserve
evidence,
or
both.
ms.
bridget
a.
chambers
but
certainly
there
would
not...
that
would
not
meet
the
needs
to
preserve
evidence.
yes,
there
are
some
situations
where
the
officer
could
search
under
terry,
but
certainly
not
all.
ms.
bridget
a.
chambers
again,
identity,
but
there
also
might
be...
speeding
is...
is
probably
at
the
lowest
end
of
the
continuum.
ms.
bridget
a.
chambers
certainly,
and
of
course--
ms.
bridget
a.
chambers
--he
did.
ms.
bridget
a.
chambers
he
did,
and
certainly
in
this
case
the
officer
made
no
bones
about
the
fact
that
he
suspected
that
there
were
drugs.
he
searched
for
drugs
and
he
found
drugs.
but
again,
any
rule
enunciated
by
this
court
will
apply
not
only
to
this
case
but
by
analogy
to...
to
every
case.
ms.
bridget
a.
chambers
yes,
and
under
robinson
and
gustafson,
the
court
also
said
that
the
fact
that
the
officer
didn't
believe
that
he
would,
in
fact,
find
evidence
or
a
weapon
did
not
defeat
the
need
for
the
search,
the
search
being
reasonable
under
the
fourth
amendment.
that's
the
end
of
the...
that's
the
end
of
the
question
and
the
officer
may
search.
and
we
believe
the
search
here
is
reasonable
for
a
couple
of
reasons.
first
of
all,
as
i've
said,
every
search
incident
to
citation
in
iowa
requires
probable
cause
and
initiation
of
a
prosecution.
so...
in
some
manner,
here
by
citation.
so,
by
definition,
the
officer
has
authority
and
a
right
to
make
the
arrest.
in
those
circumstances--
ms.
bridget
a.
chambers
--no.
they
may
give
warnings.
ms.
bridget
a.
chambers
yes.
ms.
bridget
a.
chambers
yes,
if...
if
by
arrest,
you
mean
saying,
you're
under
arrest.
ms.
bridget
a.
chambers
or
certainly
they--
ms.
bridget
a.
chambers
--yes.
ms.
bridget
a.
chambers
the
state,
however,
does
not
believe
that
the
court
needs
to
go
as
far
as
deciding
whether
search
could
be
conducted
where
only
a...
only
a
warning
is
issued.
ms.
bridget
a.
chambers
the--
ms.
bridget
a.
chambers
--did
you
assume
arrest?
did
i
hear--
ms.
bridget
a.
chambers
--of
course,
that's
not
this
case,
and
it
raises
i
think
the
question
of
pretext.
ms.
bridget
a.
chambers
right.
[laughter]
i
think...
i
think
they
could
do
that.
i
assume
defendants
would
raise
the
issue
of
pretext.
i
think
whren
likely
would
answer
that
question.
ms.
bridget
a.

i
think
he
could
do
that,
your
honor.
again,
we
don't
think
you
need
to
go
that
far,
but
here's
why
i
think
you
could.
i
think
the
underlying
premise,
at
least
as
i
read
whren,
was
that
the
officers
in
that
case
followed
and
subsequently
stopped
the
car
because
they
thought
they
would
find
drugs.
and...
and
the
issue
there,
of
course,
was
pretext.
and
i
think...
i
think
that
what
the
court
is
getting
at
is
if
the
officer
really
all
along
wanted
to
search,
was
that
arrest
pretextual
and
if
so,
is
that
improper.
and
it's...
under
whren
it
would
be
the
state's
position
it
would
not
be
proper.
now,
it
may
not
be
good
public
policy
and
it
may
raise
some
other
concerns,
but...
but
those
wouldn't
be
answered
by
the
fourth
amendment.
but
again,
that's...
that's
not
what
happened
in
this
case
and
the
rule
that
the
state
is
proposing
would
require
initiation
of
a
prosecution
either
by
citation
or
by
custodial
arrest,
leaving
for
another
day
the
hypothetical
posed
by
the
court.
ms.
bridget
a.
chambers
there
is
an
argument
to
be
made...
and
it
may
be
a
good
one...
that
probable
cause
to
arrest
alone
would
be
enough,
but
the
state
has
recognized
the
court's
concerns
in
robinson,
gustafson,
and
other
cases
that
the...
the
scope
of
the
search
and
the
immediate
need
to
search
is
related
to
custody
or
an
equivalent
of
custody.
so,
the
reason
we...
the
reason
we
are
proposing
a
rule
that
would
require
initiation
of
a
prosecution
is
that
it's
our
strong
belief
that
when
a
prosecution
is
initiated,
whether
that's
by
custodial
arrest
or
by
issuance
of
a
citation,
those...
the
same
concerns
with
officer
safety
and
preservation
of
error
arise.
ms.
bridget
a.
chambers
it
could
happen,
but
let
me
remind
the
court
that
it
could
also
happen
with
custodial
arrest--
ms.
bridget
a.
chambers
--because
that
is
the
equivalent
of
arresting
and
then
saying,
eh,
we
don't
really
want
to
proceed
with
this
prosecution.
we're
dismissing
the
charge.
ms.
bridget
a.
chambers
we
believe
that
like
the
citizenry
would
be
upset
if
custodial
arrest
were
made
in
every
case,
they
would
also
be
upset
if...
if
the
right
to
search
were
abused.
ms.
bridget
a.
chambers
well--
ms.
bridget
a.
chambers
--we're
certainly
not
advocating
that
that
should
happen,
and
we're
certainly
not...
we're
not
encouraging
that.
given
the
hypothetical,
we
think
it
could
conceivably
happen,
and...
and
for
the
same
reasons
that
arrest
followed
by
dismissal
of
the
charges
wouldn't
violate
the
fourth
amendment,
likely
that
would
not.
but
let
me
go
back
to
the...
to
the
question
posed
by...
by...
by
the
court
and
that
is,
would...
would
the
citizenry
become
upset?
certainly
if
custodial
arrest
is
abused,
it's
likely
that
the
legislative
process
would
lead
to
curbs
on...
for
which
offenses
custodial
arrests
could
be
made.
similarly,
if...
if
officers
abuse
the
right
to
search
incident
to
citation,
the
legislature
will
curb
that
authority,
and
we
not
only
believe
that
that
would
happen
if
abuse
has
occurred,
but
we
think
it
should
happen,
that
that
is
the
essence
of
the--
ms.
bridget
a.
chambers
--that's
right,
just
as
they
currently
don't
always
exercise
the
custodial
arrest.
but
again,
while
that
could
be
used
in
a
discriminatory
or
abusive
manner,
one,
there's
no
evidence
that
that's
happening
in
iowa
since
1983,
and
secondly,
if...
unless
it
violates
the
fourth
amendment,
that
kind
of
discriminatory
or
abusive
police
procedure,
while
objectionable--
ms.
bridget
a.
chambers
--they
might
but
certainly
in
this
case,
the
person
arrested
was
a
white
man
who
had
been
born
in
newton,
so
there
is
no
evidence
that
it
is
being
abused.
but,
of
course,
if
it
were
abused,
it
certainly
would
not
be
something
the
state
would
advocate.
if
it
were
abused,
the
legislative
process
or
police
regulations
or
certainly
advice
of
counsel
are
ways
that
those
kinds
of
abuses
can
be
curbed.
and
certainly
if
it's
used
in
a
discriminatory
manner,
the
equal
protection
clause
provides
the
remedy
there,
as
this
court
noted
in
whren.
i'd
like
to
point
out
just
a
couple
of
other
things
and
that
is
that
one
of
the
things
that
knowles'
proposal
would
require
is
for
this
court
to
frequently
get
into
the
issue
of
the
officer's
subjective
intent,
an
examination
that
this
court
has
rejected
time
after
time
after
again...
time
after
time
and
most
recently
in
whren.
the
reason
that
we'd
have
to
get
into
that
is
this.
some
of
the
examples
posed
by
the
court
dealt
with
when
the
officer
made
the
decision
to
search,
and
it
would
be
an
open
question,
what
happens
if
the
officer
makes
the
search
and
then
doesn't
issue
the
citation
until
later
or
then
makes
the
custodial
arrest
subsequently?
do
we
have
to
determine
whether
the
officer
intended
to
arrest
when
the
search
was
made?
do
we
have
to
determine
when
that
decision
was
made?
those
kinds
of
subjective
evaluations
are
nearly
impossible--
ms.
bridget
a.
chambers
--it
is,
but
that
would,
of
course,
require
the
court
to
set
down
a
rule
that
arrest
would
be
required
in
all
of
these
cases
rather
than
the
less
intrusive
alternative
of
issuing
a
citation.
