justice
david
h.
souter
mr.
mcclain,
i
thought
your
argument
at
least
in
part
is
somewhat
different
from
what
you
have
been
saying
to
the
chief
justice,
and
let
me
just
put
forward
what
i
thought
was
at
least
one
strand
of
your
argument,
and
you
tell
me
whether
it
is
or
it
isn't.
i
thought
at
least
one
strand
of
your
argument
was
that
the
line
represented
in
alexander,
for
example,
or
drawn
in
alexander
still
applied
here,
was
that
it
was
the
only
way
to
respect
what
congress
has
in
fact
done.
and
congress
has
in
fact
given
a
crucial
bargaining
role
to
unions
in
contract
formation,
and
therefore
there's
nothing
really
inconsistent
with
that
with
saying,
okay,
we're
also
going
to
give
the
union
an
equally
significant
role
in
determining
how
we
negotiate
enforcement
of
this
contract,
if
you
will.
but
congress
has
not
given
the
union
any
role
in
the
formation
of
the
right
under
title...
rights
under
title
vii
or
the
ada,
and
that's
why
we
are
simply
respecting
the
will
of
congress
in
saying,
you
can't
let
the
union
bargain
away
what
the
union
has
had
no
role
in
giving,
whereas
when
you
have
given
the
union
a
role
in
contract
formation
it
is
consistent
with
congressional
intent
to
let
the
union
have
a
role
in
enforcing
it.
i
thought
that
was
the
guts
of
your
argument.
justice
david
h.
souter
what
if...
i'm
sorry.
what
if
the
employee
knows
all
of
that?
he
says,
look,
i
realize
that
our
positions
are
not
exactly
right,
but
i
don't
want
to
have
to
go
through
this
myself
and
hire
a
lawyer.
i'm
willing
to
take
my
chances
with
you.
i
make
a
specific
agreement
with
you,
the
union,
which
says
you
can
arbitrate
and
otherwise
deal
with
my
rights
in
any
way
you
see
fit.
why,
if
the
agreement
is
the
kind
of
knowing
agreement
that
i've
just
described,
should
that
not
be
allowed,
because
the...
i
mean,
the
point
of
the
ada
is
to
protect
the
person
who
is
making
this
knowing
and
willing
agreement,
and
if
he
wants
to
agree,
why
is
there
a
congressional
purpose
to
disallow
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
why
should
that
be,
because
there
is
such
a
danger
that
the
union
is
going
to
be
a
coparticipant
in
the
kind
of
discrimination?
is
that
why
you
think
congress
intended
as
a
matter
of
law
to
disallow
the
kind
of
agreement
that
justice
breyer
has
and,
if
not,
what
would
the
reason
be?
justice
david
h.
souter
because
the
risk
is
just
too
great,
right?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
the--
justice
david
h.
souter
which
it
did
not
want.
i
mean,
it
seems
to
me
that...
you
say,
well,
it
didn't
unequivocally
refuse.
when
the
representative
who
would
otherwise
be
pursuing
the
claim
says,
i
advise
you
to
bring
it
as
a
private
action,
the
handwriting's
on
the
wall,
isn't
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
yes.
justice
david
h.
souter
they
didn't
want
to
press
forward
with
it,
which
is
a
pretty
good
idea
of
the
vigor
with
which
they
would
have
gone
forward
if
they
had
had
to.
justice
david
h.
souter
not
necessarily,
but
if
you
were
a
betting
man,
isn't
that
what
you'd
bet?
