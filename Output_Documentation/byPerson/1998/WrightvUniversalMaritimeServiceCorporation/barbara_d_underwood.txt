ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
a
worker's
right
to
a
judicial
hearing
on
a
claim
of
employment
discrimination
is
an
individual
right
that
can't
be
waived
by
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
between
the
union
and
an
employer.
this
court
said
so
in
alexander
in
1974
and
has
reaffirmed
that
principle
many
times
since
then.
it's
a
matter
of
statutory
interpretation,
as
justice
souter
said
earlier,
and
the
court
said
so
recognizing
a
fundamental
tension
between
individual
statutory
rights
conferred
by
congress
and
collective
representation.
the
court
said
that
unions
are
properly
concerned
with
the
collective
interests
of
their
members,
and
that
it
would
be
inconsistent
with
the
individual
focus
of
at
least
the
antidiscrimination
laws
to
let
a
union
decide
whether
and
how
to
enforce
claims
under
those
laws.
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
well,
i'd
like
to
say
that
not--
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
--well,
but
your
right
to
money,
your
wages
and...
except
for
the
minimum
wage
requirements
established
by
the
federal...
by
the
fair
labor
standards
act
are
precisely
what
the
union
was
set
up
and
authorized
by
congress
to
negotiate.
this,
as
i
said,
is
a
question
of
interpreting
statutory
regimes,
and
this
court
concluded
correctly
that
there
were
two
regimes
here,
one
in
which
congress
conferred
the
power
to
invoke
and
waive
both
rights
and
procedures
ancillary
to
those
rights
on
individuals,
and
the
other
on
unions,
and
there's
an
additional
reason
for
adhering
to
that
regime
now,
because--
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
--that's
true.
the
question
is,
who
did
congress
intend
to
confer
the
power
of
enforcing
those
rights
upon
in
a
unionized
workplace?
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
well,
i
think
there's
a
question
about
whether
congress
intended
to
permit
unions
to
settle
in
advance,
which
is
what
this
is,
not
to--
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
--oh,
to
settle
the
existing
claim?
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
yes.
i
would
read
the--
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
--antidiscrimination
laws
as
prohibiting
that
for
several
reasons.
one,
the
structural
analysis
that
i
believe
the
court
undertook
in
alexander,
because
the
court
said
not
only
the
contract
did
not
give
the
union
the
power
to
settle
the
statutory...
to
waive
the
judicial
forum
for
the
statutory
claim,
but
that
it
could
not.
but
beyond
that,
i
think
it's
implausible
to
think
that
congress
gave
unions
the
power
to
assert
or
waive
their
members'
rights.
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
well,
one
of
the
things--
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
--one
of
the
things
i'd
point
to
is
the
fact
that
in
the
antidiscrimination
laws,
in
title
vii
in
the
ada
and
the
adea,
the
unions
are
identified
as
potential
defendants,
and
it
seems
implausible
that
congress
would,
in
the
same
statute
that
it...
and
there's
a
historical
reason
why
that's
so.
that
is,
the
unions
had
been
and
perhaps
still
are
sometimes
participants
in
the
discrimination.
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
well,
we're
not
challenging
the
gilmer
propositions
that
you
can
agree
to
arbitration
of
these
antidiscrimination
claims
as
well.
the
point
is
that
you
can't...
that
congress
didn't
intend
that
the
union,
who
will
frequently
be,
or
sometimes
be
allied
with
the
discriminator,
couldn't...
could
make
the
agreement
on
your
behalf,
that
the
union
doesn't
have
the
same
undivided
duty
of
loyalty
in
relationship
to
employees,
particularly
with
regard
to
these
discrimination
issues,
as
does
your
lawyer,
whose
obligation
is
entirely
of
direct
loyalty
to--
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
--well,
i
think
the
statutes,
the
antidiscrimination
statutes
are
fairly
read
as
reserving
to
the
individual
the
right
to
assert
or
waive
both
the
statutory
right
itself
and
the
judicial
forum
for
it,
but
it
would--
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
--well,
i
think
that's
one
of
the
reasons.
i
think
it's
not
just,
however,
being
a
coparticipant
in
the
discrimination.
it
is
the
nature
of
the
union's
obligation
that
it
has
a
broad
discretion,
consistent
with
the
duty
of
fair
representation,
to
decide
which
claims
to
enforce,
how
vigorously
to
enforce
them,
that
it
may
make
a
judgment,
for
example,
that
it
would
be
more
productive
in
the
area
of
sexual
harassment
to
negotiate
policy
changes
with
the
employer
and
leave
the
pressing
of
individual
claims
alone
for
the
time
being
while
these
general
policy
negotiations
are
going
on.
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
this
individual
employee...
this
compuls...
this
arbitration
clause
was
a)
agreed
to
by
the
union
and
not
by
the
employee
and
2)
constructed
an
arbitration
process
that
was
controlled
by
the
union
and
not
by
the
individual.
so
yes,
it
does
not
present
the
question,
could
such
a
contract
exist,
although
i
think
that
there's
a
serious
question
about
whether
it
could.
i
do
want
to
address
a
question
that
was
raised
earlier
about
whether
the
union
workplace
would
necessarily
be
a
gilmer
free
world,
that
is
to
say,
whether
it
would
be
possible
to
negotiate
such
contracts
in
the
union
workplace.
and
i
think...
and
the
point
was
made,
but
i'd
just
like
to
emphasize
it,
that
the
union
could,
under
case,
authorize
such
contracts.
it
might
in
some
workplaces
be
unlikely
that
it
would
do
so.
in
workplaces
where
individuals
have
a
great
deal
of
power
themselves,
union
contracts
often
do
reserve
the
possibility
of
individual
contracts
about
all
manner
of
things,
to
baseball
players
and
people
in
the
entertainment
industry,
perhaps
not
so
often
to
longshoremen.
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
yes.
but
to
return
to
justice
souter's
question,
it
would
be
possible...
i
believe
the
statutes
prohibit
the
employee
from
delegating
to
the
union
the
power
to
make
these
agreements,
but
another--
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
--yes.
but
an
alternative
would
be
to
indulge...
to
establish
a
strong
presumption
against
such
a
delegation
so
that
when
the
contract
is
being
interpreted...
and
perhaps
that
was
what
informed
alexander.
after
all,
this
court
said
that
if
the
alexander
did
not
in
fact
cover
statutory
rights--
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
--because
it
could
not.
