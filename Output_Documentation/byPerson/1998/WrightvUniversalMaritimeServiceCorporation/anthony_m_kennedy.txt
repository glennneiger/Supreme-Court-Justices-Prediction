in
that
hypothetical
could
the
employer
make
it
a
condition
of
employment?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
could
the
employer
say,
we've
agreed
on
this
framework
and
you're
going
to
let
me
go
to
individual
employees,
but
if
they
don't
sign
this
they
can't
work
for
me?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
no,
no.
but
justice
breyer's
question
is,
what's
wrong
with
a
decision...
you
would
lose
in
this
case,
but
from
the
standpoint
of
logic
and
rationality,
what's
wrong
with
our
saying,
look,
these
grievance
procedures,
grievance
committees
are
not
set
up
as
adjudicative
bodies.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
these
people
don't
know
anything
about
adjudicating
a
claim
under
this
act.
so
what's
wrong
with
saying
that
it
simply
doesn't
cover
such
claims
unless
it
specifically
says
so?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
that
is
part
of
my
question.
after
all,
this
is
a
grievance
committee
consisting
mostly
of
employees
and
representatives
of
employers.
they're
not
an
adjudicative
body
in
the
normal
course,
and
why
isn't...
what's
wrong
with
justice
breyer's
suggestion
that
we
simply
presume
that
claims
of
this
type
are
not
to
be
submitted
to
that
kind
of
agent,
absent
specific
language?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--is
your
answer
to
me
that
there's
an
independent
arbitrator,
that's
only
if
the
committee's
unable
to
reach
a
majority
decision
within
72
hours.
