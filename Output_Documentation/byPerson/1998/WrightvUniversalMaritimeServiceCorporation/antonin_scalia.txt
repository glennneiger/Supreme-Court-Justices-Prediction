justice
antonin
scalia
why
is
that
worse
for
a
statutory
claim
than
it
is
for...
is
that
only
bad
for
federal
statutory
claims,
or
is
it
state
statutory
claims
as
well?
justice
antonin
scalia
to
state
statutory
claims.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
is
a
state
statutory
claim
against...
well,
let's
assume...
or
a
federal,
against
discrimination,
why
is
that
more
important
to
the
worker
than
his
common
law
right
to
get
the
money
owed
him
for
work
performed
under
a
contract?
i
mean,
you
know,
as
between
one
and
the
other,
which
one
would
you
rather
give
up?
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
me
neither,
but
if
i
had
to
pick
i
would
think
my
right
to
agreed
upon
contract
compensation
might
be
the
more
important
to
me,
to
tell
you
the
truth.
justice
antonin
scalia
what's
the
reason
for
this
rule?
and
what
if
california
codifies
its
law
of
contract
so
that
your
right
to
get
money
for
a
day's
work
as
agreed
upon
in
the
contract
becomes
a
statutory
right?
it
then
becomes,
what,
nongrievable
in
the
union
contracts?
justice
antonin
scalia
all
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
congressional
law
is
interstitial.
i
mean,
federal
law,
especially
in
these
areas
of
contract,
is
really
not
the
dominant
law.
the
states
have
determined,
i
can
say
just
as--
justice
antonin
scalia
--just
as
ponderously
the
states
have
determined
that
a
man
or
woman
should
get
a
day's
pay
for
a
day's
work
as
agreed
upon,
and
has
determined
that
there
should
be
a
lawsuit
available
for
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
not
sure
what
you're
saying.
are
you
saying
that
the
rule
you're
arguing
for
is
that
only
federal
statutes
cannot
be
made...
cannot
be
disposed
of
in
the
collective
bargaining
arbitration
process?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
must
not
be
familiar
with
the
legislative
process.
justice
antonin
scalia
can
the
union
do
that?
i
didn't
know
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
do
you
know
of
any
instances
where
they...
you
see,
one
of
the
things
that
affects
me
about
this
case
is,
if
i
were
an
employer,
i
would
have
a
severe...
and
with
the
multiplication
of
federal
laws
affecting
the
employment
relationship,
the
ada
and
a
number
of
others,
i
would
be
very
disinclined
to
have
a
unionized
shop
if
it
means
that
neither
the
union
can
agree
to
have
all
of
these
common
disputes
arbitrated,
nor
can
the
individual
employee.
justice
antonin
scalia
but--
justice
antonin
scalia
--i
thought
the
rule
was
the
individual
employee
cannot
negotiate...
in
a
unionized
situation
the
negotiation
between
the
employer
must
be
through
the
union.
it
cannot
be
with
the
individual.
so
you
cannot
get
each
individual
employee
to
agree,
we'll
go
to
arbitration
on
all
these
title
vii
claims,
these
ada
claims.
you
can't
go
to
the
individual
employees.
whereas
the
employer
who
doesn't
have
a
union,
when
he
hires
people
as
part
of
the
employment
contract,
any
disputes
about
title
vii,
about
the
ada,
will
go
to
arbitration.
that
would
be
lawful
in
that
situation,
wouldn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
not
if
it's
a
condition
of
employment?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
know
we
said
that,
but
i--
justice
antonin
scalia
--i'm
still
not
sure
i
understand
why
it's
so.
it
might
seem--
justice
antonin
scalia
--like
my
individual
right
to
money
is
no
less
individual
than
my
individual
right
not
to
be
discriminated
against.
justice
antonin
scalia
both
of
these
laws
apply
to
the
employment
relationship
equally.
my
right
to
get
paid
for
the
work
i
do
is
a
right
that
relates
to
the
employment...
my
right
not
to
be
discriminated
against
by
the
employer,
not
to
be
fired
for
reasons
that
would
violate
the
ada,
they
relate
to
the
employment
relationship
just
as
well.
i
don't
know
how
you
can--
justice
antonin
scalia
--am
i
missing...
am
i
missing
the
boat
here,
or
is
it
really
not
justice
breyer's
question
that
we
have
before
us
here?
as
i
understood
his
question,
it
was
the
individual
employee
who
would
agree
to
waive
it,
and
that's
not
the
situation
here.
it
was
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
that
this
individual
employee
had
no
control
over,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
you're
not
asking
us
to
agree
with
you
on
the
second
one.
justice
antonin
scalia
you're
just
saying
that
that's
what
you
think
will
happen,
but
we
could
agree
with
you
as
to
what
should
happen
to
this
case
and
disagree
with
you
as
to
what
happens
when
whatever
the
result
of
the
arbitration
is
is
brought
before
a
court.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
have
to
agree
with
both
just
because
i
agree
with
one.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
are
they
less
specific?
i
mean,
give
me
an
example
of
why
they're
less
specific.
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
really
hard
to
tell,
isn't
it?
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
spent
a
lot
of
time
on
it,
though.
justice
antonin
scalia
this
case
is
here
on
certiorari
from
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
fourth
circuit.
petitioner
ceasar
wright
was
a
longshoreman
in
charleston,
south
carolina
and
a
member
of
the
international
longshoremen's
association
afl-cio
which
has
a
collective
bargaining
agreement,
the
cba,
as
we
call
it,
with
the
south
carolina
stevedores
association.
the
cba
contains
a
general
arbitration
clause
which
covers
"matters
under
disputes".
in
1992
wright
was
injured
at
work
and
sought
compensation
for
permanent
disability.
under
the
longshore
and
harbor
workers
compensation
act,
wright
ultimately
settled
that
claim.
in
1995,
he
returned
to
work
and
was
referred
to
four
stevedoring
companies
through
the
union's
hiring
hall.
when
the
companies
learned
however
that
wright
had
previously
settled
the
claim
for
permanent
disability
they
informed
the
union
that
they
would
no
longer
accept
him
for
employment.
instead
of
filing
a
grievance
pursuant
to
the
cba
wright
filed
charges
of
employment
discrimination
with
the
eeoc
and
the
south
carolina
state
human
affairs
commission.
he
alleged
that
the
stevedoring
companies
refusal
to
hire
him
violated
the
americans
with
disabilities
act.
after
receiving
a
right
to
sue
letter
wright
filed
the
present
lawsuit.
the
district
court
dismissed
the
complaint
without
prejudice
because
wright
failed
to
use
the
cba
arbitration
procedure,
the
fourth
circuit
affirmed.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today
we
reverse
the
fourth
circuit.
this
dispute
implicates
two
lives
of
our
case
law,
a
case
called
alexander
versus
gardener
denver
decided
in
1974,
held
that
an
employee
does
not
forfeit
his
right
to
judicial
forum
for
a
title
vii
discrimination
claim
if
he
first
pursues
his
grievance
to
arbitration
under
a
cba.
a
case
called
gilmer
versus
interstate
johnson
lane
corp
decided
in
1991
held
that
a
claim
under
the
age
discrimination
in
employment
act
could
be
subjected
to
compulsory
arbitration
pursuant
to
an
arbitration
agreement
agreed
to
buy
an
individual
in
a
securities
registration
form.
although
these
cases
are
relevant
to
our
disposition
of
the
present
dispute,
we
find
it
unnecessary
to
resolve
the
question
whether
after
gilmer
a
union
may
waive
an
employees'
rights
to
a
federal
judicial
forum
for
antidiscrimination
claims.
because
we
conclude
that
in
this
case
no
such
waiver
has
occurred.
the
respondents
rely
upon
the
presumption
of
arbitrability
we
have
found
in
section
301
of
the
labor
management
relations
act.
we
conclude
that
this
presumption
does
not
extend
beyond
the
reach
of
its
principle
rationale,
which
is
that
labor
arbitrators
are
in
a
better
position
than
courts
to
interpret
and
apply
the
terms
of
a
cba.
this
case
however
ultimately
concerns
not
the
interpretation
or
application
of
a
cba
but
rather
the
meaning
of
the
americans
with
disabilities
act.
we
hold
that
any
union
negotiated
waiver
of
employee's
rights
to
a
federal
judicial
forum
for
statutory
antidiscrimination
claims
must
be
clear
and
unmistakable.
we
do
not
find
such
a
clear
and
unmistakable
waiver
in
this
cba.
for
that
reason
we
vacate
the
judgment
of
the
fourth
circuit
and
remand
the
case
for
further
proceedings.
our
opinion
is
unanimous.
