chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
number
97-889,
ceasar
wright
v.
universal
maritime
service
corporation.
mr.
mcclain.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
would
it
not
have
been
binding
on
the
petitioner?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
then
you're
saying
that
the
collective
bargaining
agreement,
because
it
didn't
specify
statutory
claims,
didn't
include
this
kind
of
a
claim?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
in
what
cases?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
you
said
a
holding
of
this
case,
and
now
you
say...
the
case
you
cite
for
the
holding,
you
say
it
was
indicated
in
the
case.
was
livadas
a
holding
on
this
point?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
alexander's
been
cut
back
in
later
cases
by
our
court.
some
of
the
reasoning
of
alexander
has
certainly
been
undercut
as
to
arbitration
not
being
a
satisfactory
way
of
handling
these
cases.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
that
simply
states
the
conclusion.
what
if
this
case
had
come
up
under
the
federal
arbitration
act,
that
these
people
were
not
longshoreman,
but
the
federal
arbitration
act
would
apply
to
their
contracts?
there
we
would
probably
hold
that
this
was
arbitrable,
don't
you
think?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
no,
but
let's
assume
we
did
decide
that
point
in
favor
of
arbitration.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
are
you
answering
my
question,
or--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--okay.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
keep
trying.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
the
union
certainly
is
capable
of
enforcing
the
contract
rights,
and
it
may
have
to
give
away
some
of
mr.
wright's
claims
there,
and
you're
saying
that
there's
some
magic
difference
between
statutory
rights
and
contract
rights?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
if
you
made
the
arbitration
clause
broader,
supposing
it
said
specifically
that
we
include
statutories,
then
you
could
say
that
was
an
integral
part
of
the
thing,
too.
that
just
states
the
conclusion.
to
say
it's
an
integral
part--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--well--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--well,
but
why
does
that
make
a
difference?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
either
between
the
faa
and
the
present
situation
or
between
statutory
rights.
i
mean,
if
arbitration
is
favored,
i
mean,
why
don't
we
encourage
the
inclusion
of
arbitration
clauses
in
federal
labor
contracts,
allow
for
the
arbitration
and
statutory
rights?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
would
it
do
that?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
maybe
it
does
have
authority
to
make
these
decisions
with
limited
scope
of
review.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
if
his
right
to...
if
his
right
to
contract
for
wages
is
subject
to
that,
why
shouldn't
his
statutory
rights
be
subject
to
that?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--how
did
congress
approve
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
by
not
addressing
a
case
congress
confirms
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
maybe
what
you're
saying
is
that
the
ji
case
law
is
for
the
benefit
of
the
union,
that
you
can't...
the
employer
can't
make
individual
contracts.
if
the
union
wants
to
waive
that
benefit,
and
say...
and
agree
that
the
individual
can
contract
directly
with
the
employer,
that
would
be
the
only
person
who
could
complain.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
mcclain.
ms.
underwood,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
is
that
different
from
the
securities
act
cases,
where
we've
said
you
can
agree
to
an
arbitration,
and
the...
you
know,
the
obviously
the
arbitration
is
going
to
be
against
your
employer,
very
often,
or
perhaps
your
broker,
and
you
have
a
board
of
arbitrators
in
which
the
broker
has
a
large
part
of
saying
who's
going
to
be
appointed.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
fickle
workers,
eh?
[laughter]
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
ms.
underwood.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
edwards,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
nothing
that
specifically
includes
statutory
claims.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--these
people
are
longshoremen,
are
they
not?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
could
you
show
that
an
arbitration
process
would
be
futile?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--but
the
union
wouldn't
control
the
arbitrator.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
edwards.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
97-889,
wright
versus
universal
maritime
service
corporation
will
be
announced
by
justice
scalia.
