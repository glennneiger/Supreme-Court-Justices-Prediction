mr.
edwards,
may
i
ask
you
a
question
about
the
civil
rights
act
in
1991
to
which
you
referred--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--and
which
you
quote
on
your
brief?
would
you
assume
for
a
moment
that
legislative
history
is
relevant,
and
just
take
that
premise.
are
you
familiar
with
the
passage
in
the
house
report
that
states
that
this
provision
was
intended
to
supplement
rather
than
to
supplant
the
rights
and
remedies
provided
by
statute,
and
that
the
minority
had
proposed
a
bill
that
would
have
made
it
clear
that
one
was
a
substitute
for
the
other,
and
they
rejected
that
proposal?
justice
john
paul
stevens
why
is
it
meaningless
if
it
expresses
an
intent
to
adopt
the
earlier
view?
there's
nothing
in
the
report
suggests
they
favor
the
gilmer
view.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
it
is
clear,
is
it
not,
that
the...
a
bill
was
proposed
and
rejected
that
would
have
clearly
adopted
your
view?
justice
john
paul
stevens
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
we're
talking
about
the
history
of
the
statute
on
which
you
rely,
the
1991
act.
justice
john
paul
stevens
--yes,
but
at
least--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--at
least--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--at
least
he
individually,
on
his
own,
signed
that
piece
of
paper.
that's
not
true
of
this
employee.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
if
you
win
with
that
history
we'll
surely
cut
down
the
volume
of
litigation,
i
guess.
[laughter]
