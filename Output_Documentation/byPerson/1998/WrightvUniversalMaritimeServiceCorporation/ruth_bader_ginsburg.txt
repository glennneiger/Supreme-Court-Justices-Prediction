justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you're
talking
about
301.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
lincoln
mills,
and
that--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--and
that
under
that
whole
regime
you
have
a
right
to
go
to
court
but
you
have
to
use
the
grievance
arbitration
procedure--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--so
that
works
for
the
whole
collective
bargaining
regime.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
was
your
distinction
of
gilmer
primarily
that
the...
it
is
not
the
worker
that
has
a
claim
in
the
grievance
procedure,
it
is
the
union
that
is
in
control
and
that's--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--that's
how
you
differ
it
from
gilmer?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
may
i
ask
if
the
end
result,
then,
is
what
you're
saying
is,
in
any
employment
covered
by
a
collective
bargaining
contract
you
simply
cannot
have
a
gilmer
type
deal
because
the
employer,
under
the
nlra
the
employer
cannot
contract
with
the
employee,
but
only
with
the
union?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
union
is
in
the
driver's
seat
on
all
of
this,
so
what
you
said
is,
the
union
if
it
wants
to
can
say,
we're
going
to
give
up
the
control
rein
that
we
hold
over
the
grievance
procedure
and
we're
going
to
let
this
person
make
this
deal
with
the
employer,
but
the
union
stands
at
the
gate,
and
unless
the
union
says
yes,
the
employer
cannot
make
a
deal
with
the
individual
employee,
right?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
it
is
the
case
that
in
a
collective
bargaining
situation
the
employer
will
not
be
able
to
make
a
gilmer
deal,
because
he
can't
deal,
get
past
the
union.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
i
mean
is
he
can't
get...
he
can't
get...
he
can't
go
directly
to
the
individual
employee.
he
can
go
only
if
the
union
says
okay,
which
seems
unlikely
that
the
union's
going
to
give
up
control
over
the
grievance
procedure.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
do
i
understand--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
either
way
we're
going
to
have
that,
is
that
not
true,
unless
we
overrule
alexander,
because
alexander
says
it
comes
in
after
the
grievance
and
arbitration
procedure
has
been
used,
and
then
the
court
says,
but
title
vii
is
something
different,
so
there's
already
a
separate
regime.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--i
don't
understand,
because
it
seems
to
me
that
if...
unless
there's
going
to
be
very
limited
review
of
the
arbitration,
then
all
this
is
is
a
protraction
thing.
it
says,
yeah,
you've
got
your
good
old
title
vii
right
in
court
with
a
jury
trial,
but
you
have
to
wait
and
go
to
arbitration,
and
then
whatever
the
result
is,
if
you
don't
like
it,
come
to
court.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
instead
of
talking
about
judge
edwards'
decision,
could
you
tell
me
how
you
think,
if
you
prevail
in
this
case,
what
happens
when
the
employee
says,
i
don't
like
what
the
union
got
for
me,
i'm
bringing
my
own
title
vii
case?
can
he
do
that?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i'm
not
asking
about
several.
i'm
asking
about,
does
he
have
a
title
vii
remedy?
i'm
not
asking
anything
about
bad
faith,
duty
of
fair
representation.
he...
is
this
just
a
question
of
primary
jurisdiction,
as
it
seemed
to
be
in
alexander?
then
you
come
to
title
vii.
the
employee
files
his
title
vii
claim.
he
doesn't
like
the
result
of
the
arbitration,
as
the
employee
didn't
in
alexander.
he
comes
to
court,
and
then
what?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
let
me
ask
you--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--a
very
particular
question,
then.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
title
vii
nowadays
gives
a
plaintiff
a
jury
trial.
in
my
case,
yes
or
no,
would
my
person
who
goes
to
title...
who
goes
to
court
on
his
title
vii
after
the
grievance
procedure
and
he
doesn't
like
the
result,
does
he
get
a
jury
trial?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
now
you're
going
on
to
another
point
about
the...
what
was
the
adr
thing
in
the
1991
act,
and
i
think
judge
posner
takes
a
view
of
that
quite
different
from
the
one
that
you--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--but
anyway,
let's...
so
you're
saying
that
in
essence
you
are
asking
us
to
overturn
alexander,
because
you've
given
me
the
answer
that
if
you
prevail
here
you
come
to
court
and
you
get
some
kind
of
standard
of
review
that's
less
than
de
novo,
and
you
don't
get
a
jury
trial.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--may
i
ask
you,
mr.
edwards,
about
some...
a
part
of
this
picture
that
is
troublesome
to
me,
particularly
in
light
of
a
case
that
we
heard
monday
and
that
i
think
really
distinguishes
gilmer,
however
arm
twisting
you
think
that
arrangement
might
be,
it's
signed
by
the
individual.
now,
we
know
that
there
are
people
covered
by
collective
bargaining
contracts
who
don't
want
to
have
one
thing
more
to
do
with
that
union
than
they
are
absolutely
forced
by
the
law
to
do,
so
i'm
thinking
about,
if
you're
right,
what
about
abood,
beck...
do
those
people
who
say,
i
don't
want
the
union
to
be
my
representative,
have
to
say
that
the
union
is
going
to
be
in
the
driver's
seat
and
handling
all
these
claims?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
my
only
question
was--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--in
deciding
what
these
two
statutes
mean,
putting
them
all
together,
isn't
that
a
relevant
consideration,
that
gilmer
is
an
individual
who
speaks
for
himself
or
herself.
here
is
a
collective
bargaining
contract,
and
it
includes
some
people
who
may
just
love
the
union,
other
people
who
hate
it.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
we
know
there
are
workers
who
say,
we
don't
want
it.
we
just...
we
don't
believe
in
unions.
we
don't
want
to
be
represented
by
unions.
the
federal
law
forces
us
to
some
extent,
but--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
the
union
said
they
didn't
want
to
take
it,
told
him
to
go
to
court.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
in
any
event,
unions
don't
have
to
process
every
grievance.
