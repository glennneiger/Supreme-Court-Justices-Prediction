mr.
ray
p.
mcclain
excuse
me.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
petitioner
ceasar
wright
seeks
a
hearing
on
the
merits
of
his
claim
that
the
respondents
violated
his
rights
under
the
americans
with
disabilities
act
when
they
refused
to
accept
him
for
work
when
he
was
referred
from
the
union
hiring
hall.
as
the
district
court
found
when
mr.
wright
was
refused
work,
he
took
the
matter
to
the
union.
the
union
protested
on
his
behalf,
but
when
the
employers
would
not
accede
to
the
union's
protest,
the
union
decided,
as
the
district
court
found,
that
they
would
not
pursue
the
matter
as
a
formal
grievance,
and
recommended
that
mr.
wright
should
take
the
matter
to
private
counsel
to
bring
the
case
under
the
americans
with
disabilities
act.
mr.
ray
p.
mcclain
this
grievance
procedure
i
do
not
believe
was
thought
by
the
union
to
cover
it.
mr.
ray
p.
mcclain
not
with
finality.
no,
not
binding
on
the
petitioner,
if
it
was...
if
it
had
been
addressed,
no.
mr.
ray
p.
mcclain
because
the
grievance
procedure
itself
did
not
specifically
provide
for
a
statutory
claim
to
be
pursued
through
that
manner.
mr.
ray
p.
mcclain
that's
been
the
holding
of
this
court
for
years,
your
honor.
mr.
ray
p.
mcclain
livadas
v....
the
livadas
case
is
the
most
recent
one,
in
which
it
was
indicated
that
the
waiver
of
an
individual's
right
to
proceed
under
a
law
that
was
applicable
to
all
workers
would
not
be
inferred.
mr.
ray
p.
mcclain
i
believe
it
actually
was
part
of
the
holding
of
that
case,
your
honor.
i'd
have
to
read
it
more
carefully
to
be
absolutely
sure
of
that.
mr.
ray
p.
mcclain
no,
because
as
in
alexander
the
petitioner
had
both
remedies
recognized
by
this
court's
decision.
mr.
ray
p.
mcclain
that's
correct,
your
honor,
but
however,
an
essential
part
of
the
reasoning
of
alexander
which
this
court
emphasized
in
the
decision
in
the
gilmer
case
is
as
applicable
today
as
it
was
when
alexander
was
decided,
and
that
is
that
mr.
wright
had
no
legal
authority
to
compel
a
hearing
on
his
claim.
he
was
at
the
mercy
of
the
union's
decision
as
to
whether
or
not
the
matter
would
be
pursued.
mr.
ray
p.
mcclain
the
same
rule
applies
to
the
state
statutory--
mr.
ray
p.
mcclain
--which
livadas
was
an
example
of.
mr.
ray
p.
mcclain
i
don't
want
to
give
up
either
one,
justice
scalia.
mr.
ray
p.
mcclain
well--
mr.
ray
p.
mcclain
--your
honor,
basically...
let
me
back
off
just
a
minute
and
try
to
start
with
the
questions
one
at
a
time.
mr.
ray
p.
mcclain
first,
congress
has
determined
that
certain
minimum
standards
should
apply
to
all
workers,
and
they
have
determined
that
these
minimum
standards
are
enforceable
in
court,
and
they've
determined
that
they're
only...
as
this
court
held
in
alexander,
it
has
been
determined
that
there
are
only
two
jurisdictional
requirements
for
going
to
court.
mr.
ray
p.
mcclain
well,
i
would--
mr.
ray
p.
mcclain
--but
in
the
unionized
contract
context,
it
is
in
fact
federal
law
that
governs
because
of
the
statutory
relationship
between
the
union
as
the
exclusive
bargaining
agent
for
the
workers
in
that
unit,
and
so
the
union
has
to
be
the
party
to
enforce
the
rights,
and
the
rights
that
it
can
enforce
are
those
which
it
has
negotiated
with
the
employer.
that's
the
nature
of
that
particular
workplace.
it
has
been
organized
pursuant
to
federal
statute,
as
construed
and
applied
for
decades
by
this
court.
mr.
ray
p.
mcclain
no,
sir.
what
i
was
stating...
i
was
trying
to
answer
your
question
about
whether
this
was
a
matter
of
state
law,
the
contract
right,
and
the
fact
is
that
the
contract
right
under
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
is
totally
regulated
by
federal
law,
and
the
rights,
the
manner
in
which
those
contract
rights
are
created,
and
the
manner
in
which
those
contract
rights
are
enforced
are
thoroughly
regulated
by--
mr.
ray
p.
mcclain
--that's
correct.
mr.
ray
p.
mcclain
yes,
ma'am.
mr.
ray
p.
mcclain
first,
under
301--
mr.
ray
p.
mcclain
--that's
correct.
mr.
ray
p.
mcclain
that's--
mr.
ray
p.
mcclain
--that's
absolutely
right.
that's
why
the
union
is
not
capable
of
making
the
same
promise
that
mr.
gilmer
made,
because
the
union
cannot
say,
under
the
labor
grievance
mechanism,
that
mr.
wright
will
have
the
power
to
enforce
this
contract.
mr.
ray
p.
mcclain
well,
your
honor,
of
course
this
court
has
not
decided
the
question
of
whether
or
not
the
federal
arbitration
act
applies
to
any
contract
of
employment.
mr.
ray
p.
mcclain
and
then...
well,
no...
the
critical
distinction
between
mr.
gilmer's
situation
as
an
individual
and
mr.
wright's
situation
as
a
member
of
an
organized
bargaining
unit
is
absolutely
critical.
both
mr.
wright
has
not
in
fact--
mr.
ray
p.
mcclain
--i'm
trying
to.
mr.
ray
p.
mcclain
sorry.
mr.
ray
p.
mcclain
the
answer
is
no
under
the
faa,
because
the
promise...
the
union
just
can't
make
the
same
promise.
mr.
ray
p.
mcclain
that
is
the
case
because
the
whole
labor
grievance
arbitration
process
for
enforcing
the
contract
rights
is
an
integral
part
of
the
bargain.
mr.
ray
p.
mcclain
no,
sir,
i'm
sorry,
i
didn't
make
myself
clear.
when
i
say
it's
an
integral
part
of
the
bargain
i
mean
that
the
decision...
in
other
words,
the
way
in
which
disputes
under
the
contract
are
to
be
resolved
is
in
the
contract--
mr.
ray
p.
mcclain
--and
there
is...
it
doesn't
have
any
source
in
external
law,
in
public
law.
mr.
ray
p.
mcclain
as
between
the
faa
and--
mr.
ray
p.
mcclain
--because
that
would
threaten
the
union's
role
as
the
exclusive
bargaining
agent.
mr.
ray
p.
mcclain
well,
the
control,
as
this
court
has
emphasized
in
decisions
such
as
vaca
v.
sipes,
the
control
of
the
grievance
process
in
the
hands
of
the
union
subject
to
only
an
extremely
limited
review
is
essential
to
the
union's
role
as...
in
enforcing
the
contract,
in
continuing
to
maintain
labor
peace
by
not
only
making
an
agreement
with
the
employer
in
the
first
place
but
by
then
resolving
disputes
that
arise
under
the
agreement
with
that
employer.
and
if
the
union
does
not
have
the
authority
to
make
these
decisions
with
a
very
limited
scope
of
review,
then
it
will
not
be
able
to
have
the
same
give
and
take
that
this
court
has
approved--
mr.
ray
p.
mcclain
--that's
correct,
and
then
that...
that
deprives
the
individual
of
his
right
under
the
federal
statute.
mr.
ray
p.
mcclain
in
part
because
this
court
concluded
in
alexander
that--
mr.
ray
p.
mcclain
--that
was
not
the
case,
and
it
has
been
reaffirmed
in
numerous
cases
since
that
time,
because
of
the
absence
of
the
ability
of
the
individual
to
control
the
prosecution
of
his
claim,
and
congress
has
approved
that
arrangement,
and--
mr.
ray
p.
mcclain
--in
the
same
way
that
congress
approved
this
court's
decision
in
the
meritor
case,
as
was
discussed
in
the
faragher
and
ellers
decisions
at
the
end
of
last
term,
that
the...
in
the
1991
civil
rights
act
congress
specifically
addressed
and
modified
some
eight
decisions
of
this
court.
it
did
not
address
meritor.
mr.
ray
p.
mcclain
well,
in...
that's...
i'm
simply
citing
the
decisions
of
this
court.
mr.
ray
p.
mcclain
i
think...
i
certainly
agree
with
your...
the
case
as
stated,
or
the
propositions
as
stated,
justice
souter.
i
don't
disagree
with
that
at
all.
i
was
trying
to
articulate
that
earlier
and
failed
to
do
so
as
well
as
you
have.
mr.
ray
p.
mcclain
well,
that
is
the
case
unless
the
union
authorizes
the
employer
to
make
a
separate
agreement
with
the
individuals.
mr.
ray
p.
mcclain
if
the
union
and
the
individual
agree
to
do
so
we
believe
that
they
can.
they
cannot
do
it
directly.
mr.
ray
p.
mcclain
i
think
i'm
trying
to
state
that
our
position
is
that
if
the
union
and
the
individual
employee
concur,
each
individual
employee
as
to
his
claims,
then
it
can
be
done.
mr.
ray
p.
mcclain
it
cannot
be
done--
mr.
ray
p.
mcclain
--not
if
it's
a
condition
of
employment,
your
honor.
i
don't
believe
that's
congress'
intent.
mr.
ray
p.
mcclain
not
if
it's
a
unilaterally
imposed
condition
of
employment.
there's
no
voluntary
right--
mr.
ray
p.
mcclain
--that's
correct,
your
honor,
and...
or
the
union
could
negotiate
a
framework
and
allow
individual
members
of
the
union...
the
bargaining
unit
to
opt
into
that
framework.
mr.
ray
p.
mcclain
could
the...
well,
the
employer--
mr.
ray
p.
mcclain
--i
don't...
well,
he
has
to
bargain
with
the
union,
and
if
the
union
doesn't...
certainly
if
the
union
does
not
agree
to
make
it
a
condition
of
employment
the
employer
could
not
impose
it
unilaterally
without
the
union's
consent.
mr.
ray
p.
mcclain
that's
the
nature
of
the
union's
role--
mr.
ray
p.
mcclain
--as
exclusive
bargaining
agent.
mr.
ray
p.
mcclain
well,
but
even
if
he
made
an
agreement
with
the
union
and...
that's
correct,
but
even
if
he
made
an
agreement
with
the
union
it
would
not
be
a
gilmer
deal
because
individual
employees
have
not--
mr.
ray
p.
mcclain
--don't
have
the
power
to
enforce
it.
mr.
ray
p.
mcclain
well,
that
may
be,
and
then
it's
a
question
for
bargaining
between
the
employer
and
the
union.
