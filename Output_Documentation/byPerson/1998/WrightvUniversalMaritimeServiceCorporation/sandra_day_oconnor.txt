do
you
think
that
the
ada
claim
could
have
been
resolved
in
a
grievance
procedure?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i'm
not
asking
you
what
the
union
thought.
i'm
asking
you
whether...
if...
suppose
the
union
said,
fine,
we'll
process
it.
do
you
think
under
this
agreement
that
under
the
grievance
procedure
this
claim
could
have
been
resolved?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
if
there
had
been
a
nondiscrimination
clause
in
the
collective
bargaining
agreement,
would
that
have
changed
the
situation
here?
would
that
have
been
enough?
justice
sandra

if...

have
been
entitled
to
go
to
grievance
on
this
claim,
this
ada
claim?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
when
the...
the
union
says
no,
we're
not
going
to
do
it.
now--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--for
saying
that.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
no.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
could
the
grievance
procedure
deal
with
the
ada
issue,
do
you
think?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
let
me
ask
you
on
that
precise
point--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--i
take
it
that
this
agreement
isn't
governed
by
the
federal
arbitration
act.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
