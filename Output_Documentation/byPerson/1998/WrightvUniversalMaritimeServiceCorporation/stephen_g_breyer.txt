justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--and
alexander
was
different.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--but
wait,
alexander,
i
take
it
a
different
case.
in
alexander
there
was
a
question
of
a
contractual
claim,
and
the
court
said
that
delegating
to
the
union
the
power
to
settle
the
contractual
claim
did
not
delegate
to
the
union
the
power
to
settle
a
statutory
claim,
which
was
a
different
claim,
and
so
what
you
seem
to
be
arguing
is
a
different
thing,
which
i
would
like
to
know
the
answer
to.
if
i
say
to
you,
i
like
you,
you're
my
friend,
i
would
like
you
to
settle
my
lawsuit
against
somebody
else,
i
can
do
that,
no
matter
whether
it
comes
under
a
statute
or
not,
so
why
couldn't
i
say,
the
union
is
my
friend.
i
delegate
to
the
union
the
power
to
settle
my
statutory
claim
against
the
employer
in
this
area?
now,
i
think
there's
a
question
of
whether
this
has
done
that,
but
suppose
it
were
absolutely
clear.
the
worker
says,
i
delegate
to
my
friend
the
union
the
power
to
meet
with
my
employer
and
settle
my
statutory
discrimination
claim.
is
there
something
in
the
statute
books
that
would
prohibit
that
from
happening?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
mean
in
my
case.
i
have
a
piece
of
paper--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--no.
they
say,
now,
we
settle
the
existing
claim.
fine.
what
i
do
is,
i
say,
it
may
be
this
employer,
whom
i
don't
trust
all
that
much,
will
one
day
discriminate
against
me,
and
i
hereby
give
to
you,
the
union,
the
power
to
settle
any
future
discrimination
claim
against
me
by
this
employer.
is
there
something
in
the
law
that
prohibits
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what?
yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it
wouldn't
be
a
power
given
to
the
union.
the
question
would
be,
normally
i
take
it
you
are
my
lawyer.
i
could
say
to
you,
lawyer,
if
mr.
smith
ever
does
anything
bad
to
me
in
a
certain
area,
i
hereby
delegate
to
you
the
power
to
settle
it.
now,
that's
the
normal
background
rule
of
law,
and
it
doesn't
limit
it
only
to
lawyers,
so
i
suppose
you'd
have
to
find
something
that
would
suggest
in
this
statute
that
although
i
could
delegate
this
power
to
my
lawyer,
i
couldn't
delegate
it
to
the
union.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
if
so,
what
is
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
can
i--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--if
you
would
like...
not
like
to
spend
more
time
on
it,
could
i
ask
you
the--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--sort
of
the
second
half
of
the
question
i
asked
ms.
underwood.
you
heard
her
response.
i
don't
know
if
you
remember
it.
but
i
was
thinking
of
the
individual
employee,
and
he
simply
delegates
expressly
to
the
union
the
power
to
settle
a
discrimination
claim
under
a
statute,
and
she
was
taken
a
little
aback,
and
she
mentioned
the
history,
and
i
take
it
the
history
shows
that
unions,
too,
are
very
much
involved
in
discrimination,
and
that
was
one
of
the
reasons
why
these
acts
were
passed.
all
right.
my
question
is,
given
that
history,
and
given
what
justice
scalia
said,
that
we're
not
dealing
with
an
individual
here,
we're
dealing
with
a
group
of
people
who
may
or
may
not
be
focusing
on
what's
in
this
particular
collective
bargaining
agreement,
and
given
ambiguous
language
in
that
agreement,
why
should
there
not
be
a
presumption
that
there
is
no
delegation
of
authority
in
the
union
to
settle
such
claims,
which
are
not
like
typical
cba
claims.
the
typical
collective
bargaining
agreement,
after
all,
sends
to
arbitration
disputes
arising
under
the
agreement,
not
normally
statutes,
unless
they're
directly
related
to
certain
labor
areas.
so
given
all
that,
why
wouldn't
we
say
under
301
in
the
discrimination
area
there
is
a
presumption
that
the
claim
is
not
delegated
to
the
union
to
settle
unless
it
pretty
clearly...
you
know,
like
a
first
options
type
of
language,
unless
it
pretty
clearly
says
that
it
is,
and
that
would
solve
the
problem,
perhaps
not
the
way
you
would
like
it
solved,
but
what
is
the
objection,
legally,
to
doing
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it
does
not
say
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it
says
that
it
would
have
to
be...
it
would
have
to
be
stated
pretty
explicitly,
and
now,
if
there
is
such
a
situation,
if
there
does
turn
out
to
be
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
where
the
union
really
goes
to
the
employees
and
says,
do
you
want
us
to
settle
these
claims,
and
they
write
it
right
into
there,
and
the
employer
signs
it,
that's
the
time
to
deal
with
the
question
that
i
asked
ms.
underwood.
but
not
here,
where
in
fact
it
doesn't
say
anything
like
that.
it's
very
general.
it's
vague.
it's
like
all
other
collective
bargaining
agreements
but
for
the
fact
that
it
doesn't
say,
explicitly
limited
to
arising
under.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
your
answer
is
no,
it
does
not
cover
it,
the
faa?
