mr.
charles
a.
edwards
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
we
believe
it's
clearly
a
question
presented
to
the
court
to
hear
as
to
whether
there
should
be
two
rules
of
law,
one
applicable
to
nonunion
employees,
and
i
mean
that
in
the
broader
sense...
that
is,
employees
not
covered
by
a
collective
bargaining
agreement,
rather
than
just
simply
union
members,
and
one
for
those
who
actually
are
bargaining
unit
members.
the--
mr.
charles
a.
edwards
well,
justice
ginsburg,
in
the
gilmer
decision
this
court
brought
up
three
issues
which
were
not
before
the
court
in
gilmer,
and
said
that
those
three
issues
represented
grounds
upon
which
alexander
had
continuing
vitality.
two
of
those
grounds,
i
would
respectfully
submit,
are
distinctions
without
a
difference,
one
being
the
presumption
in
favor
of
arbitration
under
the
federal
arbitration
act,
which
in
my
careful
reading
of
this
court's
decisions
seems
to
be
totally
the
same
as
the
presumption
in
favor
of
labor
arbitration.
the
second
was
the
question
of,
in
alexander
and
in
barrentine
and
in
mcdonald,
the
three
cases
that
were
characterized
by
this
court
as
alexander
and
its
progeny,
the
question
was,
what
is
the
binding
effect
in
terms
of
res
judicata,
collateral
estoppel,
issue
preclusion,
fact
preclusion,
whatever
you
want
to
call
them,
of
an
already
completed
arbitration
award,
or
arbitration
decision
which
you
cannot
tell
from
the
record
of
the
case
considered
the
discrimination
question
whatsoever,
and
so
it
is
certainly
possible
to
continue
to
distinguish
alexander
on
those
two
bases
or
on
the
basis...
on
the
second
ground,
and
never
get
to
a
need
to
overrule.
the
question,
however,
though--
mr.
charles
a.
edwards
--well,
the
question
of
scope
of
review
was,
of
course,
addressed
in
a
sense
in
alexander
by
saying
there
can
be
no
estoppel
effect
whatsoever,
so
there
is
nothing
to
review,
but
the
question
of
the
scope
of
review
of
an
arbitration
award
involving
statutory
claims
is,
of
course,
not
properly
presented
in
this
case.
it
is...
that's
one
which
has
been
litigated
in
great
detail
in
other
cases
which
i
certainly
presume
are
going
to
find
their
way
in
this
direction
sooner
or
later,
and
i
think
that
one
of
the
most
instructive
decisions
in
that
regard
is
judge
edwards'
decision
in
the
cole
case
in
the
d.c.
circuit,
in
which
he
advocates
a
heightened
scrutiny
standard.
because
after
all,
rather
than
deferring
to
the
arbitrator's
contract
interpretation
in
a
statutory
claim
arbitration
the
arbitrator
is,
at
least
in
some
sense,
resolving
either
questions
of
law
or
mixed
questions
of
law
and
fact
which
go
beyond
the
terms
of
the
contract
per
se
and,
therefore,
a
court
would
be
empowered
to
determine
whether,
in
fact,
the
procedures
employed
in
the
arbitration,
the
remedies
available
to
the
grievant
in
the
arbitration
comported
with
title
vii,
the
adea,
and
the
americans
with
disabilities
act.
mr.
charles
a.
edwards
certainly
i
can,
your
honor.
in
that
particular
situation,
if
we're
talking
about
a
hypothetical
employee
rather
than
about
the
petitioner
in
this
case,
a
hypothetical
employee
dissatisfied
with
the
union's
conduct
of
the
arbitration
would
actually
have,
or
the
union's
willingness
to
go
forward
with
the
arbitration
would
have
several
remedies
available
to
them.
mr.
charles
a.
edwards
when
he
is
in
court
he...
the...
a...
the
problem
then
is
determining
what
standard
of
review,
if
any,
applies
to
the
prior
arbitration
proceeding,
because
he'd
have
to
show--
mr.
charles
a.
edwards
--yes.
mr.
charles
a.
edwards
yes.
mr.
charles
a.
edwards
i
don't
believe
so,
your
honor,
because
the
same
statute
that
afforded
the
title
vii
plaintiff
a
right
to
a
jury
trial,
the
civil
rights
act
of
1991
gave
on
the
one
hand,
took
away
on
the
other
by
encouraging
alternative
dispute
resolution
through
a
section
of
that
statute,
a
section
of
the...
and
an,
virtually
identically
worded
section
of
the
americans
with
disabilities
act.
mr.
charles
a.
edwards
he
certainly
does,
and--
mr.
charles
a.
edwards
--the
plaintiff
in
gilmer
didn't
get
a
jury
trial,
either,
so--
mr.
charles
a.
edwards
--no.
mr.
charles
a.
edwards
certainly.
mr.
charles
a.
edwards
you
do
not
have
to
agree
with
both.
mr.
charles
a.
edwards
for
that
matter,
you
don't
have
to
agree
with
either.
[laughter]
mr.
charles
a.
edwards
yes.
mr.
charles
a.
edwards
pardon
me,
justice
o'connor.
mr.
charles
a.
edwards
independent
of
any
action
by
the
union?
mr.
charles
a.
edwards
if
that
were
the
case,
if
the
union
had
flatly
refused,
which
is
not
established
in
the
record,
if
the
union
had
flatly
refused,
there
is,
as
i
read
section
9(a)
of
the
national
labor
relations
act,
an
opportunity
for
the
individual
to
attempt
to
present
a
grievance
on
his
own
with
the
proviso
that
the
union
has
to
be
given
notice
of
his
intent
to
do
so,
and
i
think
he
could
have
prosecuted
it.
i
will
confess
to
your
honor
that
i
have
no
basis
under
this
particular
collective
bargaining
agreement
for
that--
mr.
charles
a.
edwards
--for
saying
that.
mr.
charles
a.
edwards
but
this
is
the
only
employment
discrimination
claim
that
has
ever
arisen
in
this
context.
mr.
charles
a.
edwards
the
grievance
procedure
could
deal
with
the
ada
issue
presented
in
this
case
because,
and
only
because...
i'm
not
making
a
position
here
that
under
the
general
language
of
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
in
question
all
discrimination
claims
can
be
arbitrated.
there
is
no
discri...
no
clause
prohibiting
discrimination
per
se
in
the
agreement.
mr.
charles
a.
edwards
nothing
that
specifically
includes
statutory
claims
except
that
section
17
of
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
requires
that
the
agreement
not
be
construed
so
as
to
violate
any
state
or
federal
laws,
which
would
mean
that,
in
ceasar
wright's
case,
in
order
for
an
arbitrator
to
determine
whether
he
was
ada.
and
therefore
this
is
one
of
those
instances
in
which
the
issue
to
be
arbitrated
is
specific
to
a
statutory
claim,
unlike
the
generalized
kinds
of
discrimination
claims
that
are
more
fairly
presented
in
cases
such
as
austin,
pryner,
brisentine,
and
various
other
cases.
mr.
charles
a.
edwards
well,
the
agreements
in
many
of
those
cases,
not
in
brisentine
but
in
austin
and
pryner,
specifically
refer
to
statutory
claims,
say
that
statutory
claims
are
dealt
with
by
this
agreement,
that
the
affirmative
obligations
of
federal
law
with
respect
to
discrimination
specifically
apply.
if
mr.
wright's
claim
had
involved
something
less
integral
to
contract
language
than
the
question
of
qualifications,
then
it
is
quite
conceivable
that
this
issue
would
not
have
been
argued
by
us
to
be
one
committed
to
the
grievance
and
arbitration
process.
mr.
charles
a.
edwards
certainly,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
a.
edwards
i'm
quite
familiar
with
that.
the
same
language
appears
in
the
conference
report
of
the
1990
civil
rights
act,
and
i
believe
also
in
the
conference
report
with
respect
to
the
americans
with
disabilities
act.
that
conference
report
goes
on
at
one
point
to
say
that
alexander
is
the
way
the
law
ought
to
be
applied.
however,
by
the
time
the
civil
rights
act
of
1991
was
enacted,
gilmer
was
the
law
of
the
land
with
respect
to
arbitration
and
much
of
that
language
in
the
legislative
history
becomes
rather
meaningless,
and--
mr.
charles
a.
edwards
--there's
no
floor
debate
on
any
of
this.
mr.
charles
a.
edwards
and
it's
also
true,
your
honor,
that
there
have
been
bills
proposed
since
gilmer
was
decided
to
overrule
gilmer,
and
those
haven't
been
enacted.
mr.
charles
a.
edwards
so--
mr.
charles
a.
edwards
--that's
correct,
and
in
the...
a
statement
by
senator
dole
immediately
prior
to
passage
in
the
senate,
senator
dole
said
that
this
provision
on
encouraging
adr
is
designed
to
further
the
goals
expressed
in
gilmer,
so
apparently
there
are
legislators
of
different
views
which--
--of
course,
senator
dole
was
speaking
for
the
minority,
and
he
had
supported
the
bill
that
was
rejected.
but
he
was
speaking
in
favor
of
the
bill
that
was
signed
by
both
houses,
and
therefore...
i'm--
mr.
charles
a.
edwards
--it's
extremely
hard
to
tell.
that's
why
i
quoted--
mr.
charles
a.
edwards
--i
would
hate
to
do
that.
i
think
this
is
one
of
those--
mr.
charles
a.
edwards
--certainly,
justice
breyer--
mr.
charles
a.
edwards
--the
critical
problem
there
it
seems
to
me
is
that
then
what
would
really
be
being
said
is
that
except
under
the
most
exceptional
circumstances
an
employer
which
has
a
collective
bargaining
relationship
with
a
union
cannot
have
statutory
discrimination
claims
for
employees
covered
by
that
relationship--
mr.
charles
a.
edwards
--with
the
arbitrator.
mr.
charles
a.
edwards
i
think
the
hypothetical
assumes
certain
facts
which
are
highly
unlikely
to
occur
in
today's
labor
management
workplace,
but
certainly
if
a
union
were
to
agree
that
individual
employees
could
consent
to
arbitration,
prospectively,
of
future
disputes,
then
that
would
present
a
clearer
case.
i
do
not
necessarily
think
that
it
follows--
mr.
charles
a.
edwards
--i
believe
your
question
presumes,
your
honor,
that
labor
arbitrators
are
less
competent
than
other
arbitrators
to
resolve
statutory
claims.
i
think
that--
mr.
charles
a.
edwards
--well,
if
all
there
were,
your
honor,
were
a
grievance
committee,
i
would
agree
with
you.
however,
we've
got
the
further
step
of
arbitration
here
by
a
neutral
selected
by
the
parties.
mr.
charles
a.
edwards
yes.
mr.
charles
a.
edwards
i
think
that
even
under
the
broadest
interpretation
of
the
federal
arbitration
act
i
would
be
hard
pressed
to
contend
that
the
faa
covered--
mr.
charles
a.
edwards
--it's
interstate
or
foreign
commerce,
and
i
think
we...
sections
1
and
2
of
the--
mr.
charles
a.
edwards
--of
the
faa
just
take
us
out
of
that
loop,
but
the
principles
are,
i
would
submit,
the
same,
so
i
don't
believe
that
the
faa
or
national
labor
relations
act
issue
is
one
that
should
be
determinative.
mr.
charles
a.
edwards
no,
the
faa
does
not,
not
under
binding
fourth
circuit
precedent,
which
is
what
i'm
having
to
deal
with
in
the
absence
of
any
specific
ruling
by
this
court.
mr.
charles
a.
edwards
they
are
longshoremen.
there--
mr.
charles
a.
edwards
--are
arguments
that
have
been
raised
and
that
i
have
seen
concerning
the
faa
that
say
that
the
exclusion
was
intended
to
deal
only
with
seamen
and
railroad
workers,
but
i
think
that
it's
pretty
hazardous
for
us
to
speculate
about
the
legislative
history
of
a
statute
enacted
in
1925,
which
as
has
been
interpreted
by
this
court
so
many
times--
mr.
charles
a.
edwards
--well,
actually
there's
a...
there
are
two
steps
in
the
appeals
process.
there's
the
port
committee
and
then
there's
the
district
committee.
but
in
actual
practice,
the
way
it
has
always
worked
under
this
collective
bargaining
agreement,
and
under
the
bargaining
agreement
that
applies
in
the
five
southeastern
ports
that
have
the
same
language,
is
that
management
votes
one
way,
labor
voters
the
other
way.
there
is
a
deadlock.
it
goes
to
arbitration.
mr.
charles
a.
edwards
the
nature
of
collective
representation
is
that
the
union
is
in
the
driver's
seat
except
to
the
extent
that
the
individual
can
and
will
assert
his
or
her
rights
under
section
9(a)
or
can
show,
for
example,
that
the
grievance
and
arbitration
process
would
be
futile,
which
is
quite
another
exception
recognized
by
this
court
on
numerous
occasions
for
avoiding
a
collectively
bargained
grievance
and
arbitration
procedure
altogether.
mr.
charles
a.
edwards
if
the
grievant
is
able
to
show
that
there
is
a
manifested
hostility
toward
protected
rights
by
the
union
in
question,
i
think
that
brings
us
back--
mr.
charles
a.
edwards
--yes.
mr.
charles
a.
edwards
no,
the
union
doesn't
control
the
arbitrator,
but
the
union
to
some
degree
is
involved
in
the
presentation
of
the
grievance.
now,
in...
under
this
agreement
there
is
no
prohibition
of
the
grievant
being
separately
represented
by
counsel.
there
are
many
agreements
that
do
prohibit
such
activities,
but
this
one
does
not,
and
so
we're
writing
pretty
much
on
a
blank
slate,
and
it's
rather
hypothetical
to
allege
futility,
or
to
conceive
of
futility
in
this
context,
and
in
fact--
mr.
charles
a.
edwards
--right.
mr.
charles
a.
edwards
actually,
i
believe
it
cuts
in
the
other
direction,
your
honor,
because
the
employee
covered
by
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
is
given
enhanced
bargaining
power,
is
given
free
representation,
is
given
a
representative
experience--
mr.
charles
a.
edwards
--then
that
employee's
remedy
is
the
same
as
robert
gilmer's
remedy
was.
he
doesn't
work
there.
the
situation
with
gilmer
was
that
he
was
faced
with
what
by
anything
that
any
of
us
i
think
could
conceive
of
would
be
properly
characterized
as
a
contract
of
adhesion.
he
signed
on
to
a
forum
which
required
a
registration,
which
required
the
applicability
of
the
new
york
stock
exchange
arbitration
rules,
and
so
to
look
at
that
as
a
knowing
and
intelligent
waiver
of
a
right
to
the
choice
of
a
forum
is
pretty
much
of
a
stretch,
but
the--
mr.
charles
a.
edwards
--the
question
of--
mr.
charles
a.
edwards
--knowing
and
intelligent,
it
doesn't
seem
to
me--
mr.
charles
a.
edwards
--no,
it's
not
true
of
this
employee.
he
was
represented
by
someone
far
more
experienced
than
he
in
dealing
with
employers.
we're
not
talking
about
the
kind
of
sophisticated
employee
that
this
court
deemed
mr.
gilmer
to
be.
instead,
we're
dealing
with
an
employee
who
the
record
shows
has
a
functional
fourth
grade
education
level,
and
therefore
the
representation
by
a
collective
bargaining
representative
should
have
been
quite
beneficial
to
him.
mr.
charles
a.
edwards
that's
not
exactly
correct,
your
honor.
the
union
said
that...
referred
him
to
private
counsel.
there's
nothing
in
the
record
that
specifically
indicates
whether
the
union
refused
to
process
his
grievance.
there
were,
in
fact--
mr.
charles
a.
edwards
--certainly
they
don't,
but
from
the
very
beginning
the
union
recognized
this
as
a
potential
ada
claim.
counsel,
or
the--
mr.
charles
a.
edwards
--they
suggested
that
he
go
to
private
counsel.
mr.
charles
a.
edwards
he
went
to
mr.
mcclain,
and--
mr.
charles
a.
edwards
--i
don't
necessarily
accept
that,
justice
souter,
because--
mr.
charles
a.
edwards
--no--
[laughter]
no,
i
would
not,
because
this
local
union
has
been
enjoined
under
boys
markets
four
or
five
times
because
they
don't
take
anything
to
arbitration.
most
of
these
are
individual
claims,
and
they
have
to
be
required
by
the
court
to
take
them
to
arbitration,
so
this
is
a
matter
of
conserving
resources
on
their
part,
i
would
suppose.
but
in
point
of
fact
it
winds
up
being
more
expensive
than
less,
and
that's
the
whole
point
of
the
arbitration
choice.
mr.
charles
a.
edwards
i
doubt
that
very
seriously,
because
since
the
third
boys
markets
injunction
we
obtained
there
have
been
no
further
wildcat
strikes,
so
i
think
that
the
message
has
gotten
across,
and
therefore
i
believe...
and
we've
had
numerous
arbitrations
since
then
that
were
not
required
by...
or
several
arbitrations
that
were
not
required
by
court
order.
with
that
in
mind,
i
think
that
the
appropriate
focus
really
is,
should
it
make
any
difference
that
ceasar
wright
was
a
longshoreman
covered
by
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
rather
than
a
foreman
working
for
the
same
stevedoring
contractor
in
the
port
of
charleston.
if
one
had
an
arbitration
clause
that
was
incorporated
in
an
application
for
employment,
or
an
employee
handbook,
or
a
policy
and
procedure
manual,
while
this
court
certainly
hasn't
squarely
addressed
any
of
those
issues,
it
would
seem
to
me
that
the
clear
weight
of
gilmer
would
be
that
this
agreement,
quote
unquote,
reached
without
bargaining
by
the
individual
would
be
binding
upon
him
or
her
as
a
forum
choice.
why
should
not
an
agreement
reached
between
an
employer
and
a
collective
bargaining
representative
who
is
obligated
under
statute
and
under
federal
common
law
to
provide
a
duty
of
fair
representation
to
the
employee
receive
a
similar
degree
of
deference?
we
think
that
the
result
is
quite
clear,
and
that
whatever
continuing
vitality
there
might
be
to
alexander
has
been
so
severely
undermined
both
by
the
course
of
this
court's
decisions
and
by
changes
in
the
historic
framework,
if
you
will.
in
1974,
this
court
was
concerned
with
massive,
systemic
discrimination
by
employers
and
labor
organizations.
we
have
come
a
long
way
since
that
time,
and
during
that
period
of
time
it's
instructive
in
my
view
to
note
that
labor
organizations
have
been
accorded
standing
to
represent
the
rights
of
members
of
collective
bargaining
units
in
asserting
claims
under
title
vii
and
other
antidiscrimination
statutes.
so
if
they
can
do
that
in
court,
why
can't
they
do
it
in
arbitration?
i
see
no
basis
for
a
distinction.
thank
you.
