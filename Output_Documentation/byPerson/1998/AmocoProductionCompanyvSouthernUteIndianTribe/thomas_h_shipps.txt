mr.
thomas
h.
shipps
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
when
congress
passed
the
1909
and
1910
acts,
the
substance
it
reserved
for
subsequent
disposition
was
the
same
substance
that
we
know
today,
coal,
and
common
descriptions
of
coal
in
1909
and
1910
made
reference
to
the
occluded
gaseous
constituents
of
coal
dissolved
within
the
mass
or
body
of
coal.
mr.
thomas
h.
shipps
well,
there
is
no
specific
formula
for
coal.
it's
a
heterogenous
substance.
the
formula
for
gas,
once
it's
removed
to
the
surface,
ch4
would
be
the
formula
for
methane,
would
be
the
same
formula
as
the
methane
molecule
located
as
an
integral
component
of
the
coal--
mr.
thomas
h.
shipps
--but
there
is
no
chemical
description
for
coal.
coal,
other...
the...
coal's
a
generic
term.
coal
talks
about
inorganic
material,
organic
material,
definitionally
it's
based
upon
the
relative
volume
or
weight
of
those
very
heterogenous
materials
versus
organic
materials.
mr.
thomas
h.
shipps
it...
well,
it's--
mr.
thomas
h.
shipps
--well--
[laughter]
it
does
pass
the
hit
in
the
head
and
hurt
test.
mr.
thomas
h.
shipps
no,
our
position
is
that
if
you
own
the
property,
the
measurable
boundaries,
whether
they
be
adjacent
property
boundaries
or
subsurface
boundaries,
and
you
complete
a
well
into
the
property
that
you
own,
then
the
rule
of
capture
makes
clear
that
you
have
no
liability
from
draining
coal...
from
draining
gas
or
a
fugacious
substance--
mr.
thomas
h.
shipps
--you--
mr.
thomas
h.
shipps
--no.
what
we
are
saying
is,
coal
is
defined
by
the
location
of
the
material
within
it,
and
when
congress
was
passing
these
statutes,
it
clearly
intended
to
reserve
the
entire
coal
estate,
the
entire
coal
resource,
and
it
intended
to
reserve
a
resource
that
was
located
in
nature,
and
found
in
nature.
petitioner's
argument
is
one
which
can
prevail
only
if
you
concur
that
congress
intended
to
reserve
a
degasified,
dehydrated
lump
of
resource
that
does
not
exist
in
nature,
and
congress
made
it
clear--
mr.
thomas
h.
shipps
--justice
o'connor,
i
respectfully
disagree.
the
federal
government
has
taken
a
number
of
positions
relative
to
this
case--
mr.
thomas
h.
shipps
--and
certainly
the
early...
i'm
sorry.
mr.
thomas
h.
shipps
they
have
indeed,
mr.
chief
justice,
but
certainly
earlier,
when
congress--
mr.
thomas
h.
shipps
--let
me
say
that
with
respect
to
congress
and
recent
incentives
for
developing
the
resource,
congress
has
never...
never
expressed
a
viewpoint
with
respect
to
ownership
of
coalbed
methane
occluded
in
coal.
in
fact,
its
definition
is
that
coalbed...
coal
seam
gas
is
occluded
within
the
resource,
dissolved
within
the
resource.
mr.
thomas
h.
shipps
and
we
believe,
and
have
believed
throughout
this
litigation
and
expressed
the
viewpoint
that
they
were
sadly
wrong,
and
in
fact
they
were
doing...
they
were
not
looking
at
the
statutory
language
here.
here,
congress
reserved
coal
in
its
natural
condition,
coal
deposits,
and
made
it
clear
that's
what
it
was
reserving,
and
the
common
understanding
in
1909
and
1910
by
the
person
that
held
a
piece
of
coal
that
he
thought
or
she
thought
that
he
owned,
or
she
owned,
wasn't
that,
oh,
i
own
everything
here
except
the
iron
pyrite,
i
own
everything
here
except
the
sulphur,
i
own
everything
here
except
the
moisture,
i
own
everything
except
the
methane.
the
common
person
in
1909
and
1910
didn't
understand
the
details
of
microporocity,
the
complexities
of
adsorption,
but
that
person
certainly
thought
that
this
lump
of
coal
that
i
own,
when
i
put
it
in
my
furnace,
or
i
put
it
in
my
stove,
i'm
not
burning
somebody
else's
property,
and
that's
the...
that
is
the
position
that
is
taken
by
the
petitioners
in
this
case.
mr.
thomas
h.
shipps
well,
we're
not
talking
about
gas
in
free
form.
we're
talking
about
gas
that's
absorbed
in
the
coal.
it's
a
gas...
it's
a
component
of
the
coal,
and
that's...
and
that,
it
seems
to
be
clear
and
undisputed
with
respect
to
the--
mr.
thomas
h.
shipps
--well,
it...
that
begs
the
question
as
to
what
you
define
as
coal,
but
it
certainly
no
longer
has
the
value
of
the
coalbed
methane
that
was
absorbed
within
the
coal,
and
in
terms
of
conventional...
conventional
uses
after
the--
mr.
thomas
h.
shipps
--it
is
because
it
no
longer
contains--
mr.
thomas
h.
shipps
--potentially
it
no
longer
contains...
if...
it
depends
upon,
if
you're
looking
upon
changes
in
mining
techniques
and
changes
in
commerce,
clearly,
it
no
longer
contains
the
heat
value
of
the
coalbed
methane.
now,
in
1910
and
1910...
1909
and
1910,
that
was
a
hazard,
and
that
wasn't
of
value
then,
but
the
definition
of
what
we
own
doesn't
change
based
upon
improvements
in
mining
techniques,
but
in
fact,
justice
kennedy,
the
depletion
of
that
value,
which
now
has
become
under
current
technologies
very
valuable,
is
a
loss
of
the
coal
estate
that
we
would
no
longer
have.
it's
a
loss
of
the
coal
resource
that
we
would
no
longer
have.
mr.
thomas
h.
shipps
it
also
incorporates
what
was
understood
in
terms
of
the
circumstances
of
this
legislation.
what
the
usgs
was
doing
in
1909
and
1910,
congress
relied
upon
the
u.s.
geological
survey
to
determine
what
was,
what
were
coal
resources,
and
the
u.s.
geological
survey
expressly
looked
to
not
just
the
present
value
of
coal,
but
to
the
potential
value
of
coal
when
it
made
its
classification
of
lands.
and
the
usgs,
with
the
encouragement
and
funding
from
congress,
investigated
the
science
of
how
gas
was
held
in
coal,
and
the
usgs
looked
to
the
potential
fuel
values
of
other
gases
that
could
be
removed
from
coal.
the
usgs
was
looking
at,
through
the
producer
generator,
how
can
you...
how
can
we
obtain
the
gases
from
coal
as
a
fuel
source,
and
that
certainly,
we
think,
is
significant
in
this
case.
and
simultaneously--
mr.
thomas
h.
shipps
--yes,
justice
scalia.
mr.
thomas
h.
shipps
it's
all
your...
everything
that
you
obtain
by
drilling
a
well
on
your
land--
mr.
thomas
h.
shipps
--that
happens
to
capture
migrating
substances
from
his
land,
you
have
no
liability
to
him
for,
and
you
own,
once
you
reduce
to
possession.
but
the
premise--
mr.
thomas
h.
shipps
--i--
mr.
thomas
h.
shipps
--my
understanding
is
that
you
can
do
that
in
any
state,
even
states
with
a
stratum
theory,
if
they're
talking
about
fugacious
minerals.
if
in
pennsylvania
you
drill
a
well
on
your
land
and
your
neighbor
happens
to
have
a
fugacious
material
located
in
the
stratum
on
his
land,
so
long
as
you
complete
your
well
in
the
property
that
you
own,
you
have
no
liability
for
what
you
recover,
and
that's...
and
actually
you
don't
get
to
any
different
place
whether
you're
talking
about
a
stratum
theory
state
or
whether
you're
not.
mr.
thomas
h.
shipps
oh,
no,
that's
frequently
correct,
mr.
chief
justice.
there
are
rules
and
regulations
as
to
how
this
can
be
done.
and
in
fact,
rules
and
regulations
with
regard
to
what
happened
in
this
case
made
it
clear
that
until
1988
the
coal
formation
and
neighboring
sandstone
formations
were
treated
as
one
producing
zone.
mr.
thomas
h.
shipps
1988,
your
honor,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
thomas
h.
shipps
that's
correct.
they
do
not
speak...
but
they
do
go
to
the
impacts
question
that's
been
raised
by
counselor
from
wyoming.
mr.
thomas
h.
shipps
no.
we
take
the
position
that
no
one
can
drill
and
complete
a
well
in
the
tribe's
coal
deposits,
which
was
the
term
that
was
used
by
congress
in
1909
and
1910--
mr.
thomas
h.
shipps
--if
they
think
they
can
do
that,
then
they're
perfectly
welcome
to
attempt
to
do
that,
subject
to
whatever
the
rules
may
be
that
have
adjusted
the
common
law
relative
to
pooling
and
unitization.
mr.
thomas
h.
shipps
that's
correct,
justice
scalia.
mr.
thomas
h.
shipps
if...
they
just...
they
don't
have
the
right
to
drill
into
our
coal
deposit
in
the
first
instance.
if
for
some
reason--
mr.
thomas
h.
shipps
--oh.
oh,
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
thomas
h.
shipps
if
they're
able
to
do
that,
then
under
the
rule
of
capture,
we
don't
have
a
claim.
we're
saying
that
they
can't--
mr.
thomas
h.
shipps
--the
location
of
the
methane
molecule
is
critical
to
our
position.
if
it's
located
in
the
coal
deposit,
if
it
is
an
integral
component
of
the
coal
deposit,
then
it
was
reserved
by
congress
in
1909
and
1910,
and
is
now
owned
by
us.
mr.
thomas
h.
shipps
justice
kennedy--
mr.
thomas
h.
shipps
--yes,
and
they
can't
do
that.
notwithstanding
what
they
said,
when
they
drill
those
wells,
they
remove
up
to
100
tons
of
solid
coal
with
regard
to
every
well
bore.
they
acknowledge
that
we
own
even
the
solid
coal.
they
cannot
remove
coalbed
methane
from
the
coal
and
leave
all
the
coal
there.
they
have
to
remove
the
solid
coal.
they
do
remove
the
solid
coal.
they
have
to
inject
things
into
the
coal
beds
under
tremendous
pressure.
hundreds
of
tons
of
sand
gets
injected
into
our
coal
deposits.
mr.
thomas
h.
shipps
except
that
the
accommodation
here
was
expressly
established
by
congress
in
the
statute.
there's...
this
is
not
a
common
law
accommodation.
the
statute
said
that
they
have
to--
mr.
thomas
h.
shipps
--no,
there
were
also
other
provisions
in
the
statute,
justice
kennedy,
that
dealt
specifically
with
the
relative
rights
of
an
agricultural
patentee
relative
to
the
coal
deposits,
and
what
the
owner
of
the
coal
deposits
would
have
relative
to
the
surface
estate,
and
the
only
exception
that
congress
made
for
the
agricultural
patentee
to
have
any
dominion
over
the
coal
deposit,
was
the
right
to
mine
coal
for
domestic
purposes
until
the
coal
deposit
was
disposed
to
a
third
party.
and
once
that
took
place,
he
gave
up
any
right,
he
disclaimed
any
right...
as
a
condition
for
even
getting
a
patent,
a
limited
patent
to
these
properties,
he
agreed
i
will
no
longer
have
anything
to
do
with
that
coal
deposit,
and
that's
the
relative
right
of
accommodations.
thank
you,
your
honor.
thank
you,
court.
