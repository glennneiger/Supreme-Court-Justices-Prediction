mr.
thomas
j.
davidson
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
as
you
know,
i'm
here
on
behalf
of
the
amici
states.
there
are
five
amici
states
which
represent
one
tenth
of
the
union.
we're
here
on
behalf
of
our
citizens
and
ourselves.
we're
here
as
friends
of
the
court
because
we
believe
the
decision
was
inherently
wrong,
but
we're
also
here
in
our
own
interests.
we,
as
amici
states,
we
as
states,
are
owners
of
lands
that
are
subject
to
these
very
same
acts.
upon
our
admission
to
statehood
for
the
creation
of
the
states
and
for
the
benefits
of
our
public
schools
we
were
granted
lands
specifically
for
the
purpose
of
funding
education,
and
we
were
constitutionally
in
our
enabling
acts
required
to
dedicate
the
proceeds
from
those
lands
to
the
purpose
of
our
state
educational
systems.
in
1906,
with
the
presidential
withdrawal
of
the
coal
lands,
we
were
not
allowed
to
select
in
lieu
lands.
now,
in
lieu
lands...
first
of
all,
upon
admission
to
the
states,
the
states
were
granted
specific
sections
of
land
within
each
township,
but
oftentimes
those
lands
had
already
been
homesteaded
or
withdrawn,
so
we
were
entitled,
then,
to
take
in
lieu
lands
instead
of
those
lands,
but
with
the
1906
reservation,
that
also
applied
to
in
lieu
lands.
so
the
states
were
in
the
position
of
not
being
able
to
select
in
lieu
lands
until
a
1912
act
came
along,
which
is
referenced
in
our
brief,
that
specifically
incorporated
the
provisions
of
the
1909
and
1910
acts,
so
that's
how
the
states
are
here.
that's
why
we
are
here
as
property
owners
as
well
as
on
behalf
of
our
citizens.
in
these
acts,
the
states
received
title
to
everything
but
the
coal
on
our
subsequent
school
selections
in
lieu
lands.
the
amici
states
here
are
holders
of
tens
of
thousands
of
acres
for
the
benefit
of
our
public
schools.
again,
they're
constitutionally
required
for
school
funding.
we
also
have
regulatory
authority,
and
given
time,
i'm
going
to
get
to
that.
we
have
regulatory
agencies
that
are
responsible
for
oil
and
gas
production,
and
the
regulation
of
oil
and
gas
production,
as
well
as
separate
entities
that
are
responsible
for
mineral
production,
such
as
coal
production.
so
anyway,
we're
here
both
as
the
owner
and
regulators
today.
now,
as
the
court
recognized
in
the
andrus
case,
andrus
v.
utah,
and
it's
cited
in
all
of
the
briefs,
i
believe,
these
lands
were
granted
to
the
states
under
a
solemn
agreement
for
the
support
of
our
public
schools.
it
was
an
inducement
for
the
states
to
come
into
the
union,
and
in
inducing
the
states
to
come
into
the
union,
they
granted
the
lands
for
the
purpose
of
our
public
schools.
mr.
thomas
j.
davidson
your
honor,
i
don't
believe
i
can
accurately
answer
that,
but
i
do
believe
that
the
states
took
into
account
that
they
were
getting
everything
in
under
these
acts
but
coal,
and
making--
mr.
thomas
j.
davidson
--the
states
knew
what
the
coal
was
at
the
time,
your
honor.
i
submit
that
everyone
knew
what
coal
was
at
the
time,
and
the
acts
that
had
preceded
the
1906
reservation
had
been
acts
under
which,
if
there
was
a
coal
seam
that
actually
appeared
on
the
surface,
or
if
there
was
active
mining,
then
those
particular
lands
would
be
reserved,
because
then
the
states
or
the
private
parties
would
know
that
there
was
coal,
because
it
was
physically
there,
physically
present,
something
that
was
tangible.
mr.
thomas
j.
davidson
your
honor,
that
was
not
the
understanding
i
believe
of
the
states
at
the
time.
it
was
not
the
understanding
of
the
parties.
it
hasn't
been...
and
your
honor,
if
i
might,
it
hasn't
been
the
subsequent
administration.
it
hasn't
been
the
subsequent
administration
either
under
the
states'
own
regulatory
schemes
or
under
the
practice
of
any
of
the
parties.
as
was
alluded
to
earlier,
the
coalbed
methane
is
obtained
by
normal
drilling
techniques,
not
by
coal
removal
techniques
that
were
known
to
the
parties
at
the
time.
those
removal
techniques,
as
mr.
justice
scalia
i
think
pointed
out,
those
were,
when
you
took
a
chunk
of
coal,
and
you
took
a
chunk
of
coal,
or
several
chunks
of
coal,
and
you
loaded
them
into
a
wagon
or
subsequently
a
truck,
and
you
hauled
them
away.
now,
in
response
to
justice
scalia's
question
regarding
ownership,
the
gas,
the
natural
gas,
the
very
faint
remnants
of
natural
gas
that
would
remain
in
that
coal,
under
normal
mining
law
practices
would
belong
to
the
owner
of
the
gas
estate,
but
the
mining
practices
have
always
followed
the
rules
of
reasonable
development,
reasonable
diligence,
and
in
following
the
rules
of
reasonable
development
and
reasonable
diligence
at
this
point
in
time,
even
now
in
1999,
it's
not
reasonable
to
extract
the
methane
gas
from
those
chunks
of
coal
that
are
removed
from
a
coal
mine.
but
while
they're
in
the
ground,
and
you
can
use
normal
gas
drilling
techniques
to
produce
those,
produce
the
gas,
then
that
is
reasonable
in
some
circumstances.
there
are
still
many
coal
beds
throughout
the
country
to
which
no
coalbed
methane
is
ever
going
to
be
produced,
probably,
at
least
under
present
technology.
mr.
thomas
j.
davidson
your
honor--
mr.
thomas
j.
davidson
--in
the
simplest
of
terms,
your
honor,
what
i'm
talking
about
is
what
can
be
removed
with
drilling
techniques,
and
in
the
instance
of
coal,
while
there
may
be
some
pockets,
typically
what
forms
is
cleats,
where
you've
got
a
layer
of
coal
and
another
somewhat
layer
of
coal,
and
then
you've
got
interspersed,
there's
little
tiny
particles
that
respondents
have
referred
to,
and
when
the
water
is
extracted,
these
cleats
allow
the
gas
that's
absorbed
in
there
to
come
up
through,
because
the
pressure
is
released,
come
up
through
the
hole,
the
drilling
hole
and
then
be
escaped
either
into
the
atmosphere--
mr.
thomas
j.
davidson
--that
would
belong
to--
mr.
thomas
j.
davidson
--whoever
is
the
owner
of
the
remainder
of
the
estate.
mr.
thomas
j.
davidson
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
j.
davidson
your
honor,
that's--
mr.
thomas
j.
davidson
--that's
exactly
right,
your
honor,
and
the
doctrine
of
accommodation
is
something
that
the
states
and
state
court
systems,
and
particularly
state
regulators,
have
had
to
deal
with
ever
since
mineral
activity
has...
had
ever
commenced.
when
oil
drilling
was
first
started,
the
natural
gas
that
was
associated
with
oil
drilling,
and
the
first
oil
well
in
wyoming,
anyway,
i
believe
was
prior
to
statehood,
1884,
but
the
natural
gas
that
comes
up
with
the
oil
well
was
flared
initially,
because
it
wasn't
valuable
for
anything.
but
as
was
pointed
out
in
an
earlier
question,
where
the
oil
and
gas
estates
are
separate,
that
can't
be
done
anymore,
and
in
fact
the
oil
and
gas,
the
state
oil
and
gas
regulators
ensure
that
that
kind
of
flaring
doesn't
happen,
because
the
states
have
an
interest.
even
where
it's
not
their
own
property,
as
such,
the
states
have
an
interest
because
of
severance
taxes
and
other
interests
that
the
states
have
in
taxing
those
products
that
there
be
conservation,
that
the
mineral
resources,
whatever
they
may
be,
be
conserved,
and
so
therefore
the
oil
and
gas
commissions
don't
allow
flaring,
and
don't
allow
wasting
of
natural
gas
products.
your
honor--
mr.
thomas
j.
davidson
--your
honor,
with
specific
respect
to
coalbed
methane
gas,
i
believe
that
answer,
that
that
is
correct,
that
they
could
not
have
specifically
been
thinking
about
coalbed
methane
gas
because
it
was
not
a
valuable
resource.
there
was
no
value.
there
was
no
ability
to
get
the
pipelines
in
and
get
the
gas
developed
and
get
it
out.
it
just
was
not
a
valuable
commodity
at
that
time.
but
just
as
natural
gas
that's
associated
with
oil
production
has
now
become
a
valuable
commodity,
so
has
the
natural
gas
associated
with
coal
production,
and
so
the
states,
as
owner
of
everything
but
what
was
specifically
reserved...
and
keep
in
mind,
wyoming
v.
united
states
establishes
a
standard
that
only
what
is
specifically
reserved
for
the
federal
government
can
apply
to
the
states,
and
the
legislation
is
to
be
construed
liberally
for
the
benefit
of
the
state.
contrary
to
the
presumption
that
the
respondents
would
like
to
raise
with
respect
to
states
in
particular,
who
took
under
the
very
same
acts
as
the
private
parties,
with
respects
to
states
in
particular,
grants,
land
grants
to
the
states
have
to
be
construed
liberally.
well,
there
was
no
reservation
to
the
u.s.
of
gas,
and
the
u.s.
at
the
time
of
passing
these
lands
to
the
states
certainly
knew
the
existence
of
gas.
thank
you,
your
honor.
