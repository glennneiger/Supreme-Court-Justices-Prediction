mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
thank
you,
mr.
chief--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--yes,
your
honor,
i
will
do
that.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
congress
did
not
distinguish
between
coal
and
cbm
in
1909,
because
a
reservation
of
coal
at
that
time
had
to
include
cbm.
there
are
four
reasons
why.
first,
coal
in
its
natural
state
always
contains
cbm
as
an
inherent
product
of
the
coalification
process.
second,
miners
in
1909
necessarily
had
to
remove
the
cbm
as
a
part
of
the
mined
coal.
third,
the
miners
had
no
way
of
setting
the
cbm
apart
or
leaving
it
behind.
congress
used
the
term,
coal,
in
light
of
those
realities,
to
describe
what
nature
had
deposited
and
what
miners
mined.
this
usage
is
not
only
the
ordinary,
practical,
common
sense
usage,
but
is
also
consistent
with
what
science
tells
us
about
coal,
both
now
and
in
1909.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
justice
o'connor,
you're
referring
to
the
1981
solicitor's
opinion,
in
which
the
government
took
the
position
that
the
coalbed
gas
was
not
a
part
of
the
coal.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
that
is
correct,
and
the
reason
why
it
was
withdrawn
is
because
it
proved
that
the
reasoning
in
that
opinion
was
deficient.
it
didn't
consider--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--justice
o'connor,
that
can't
be
the
case,
because
it
was
known
to
be
of
value...
valuable
in
1981,
when
that
opinion
was
issued.
what
the
solicitor
has
tried
to
do
in
both
1981
and
the
present,
and
at
the
present,
is
try
and
resolve
this
rather
difficult
technical
issue.
its
first
attempt
in
1981
proved
to
be
deficient,
because
it
did
not
consider
what
we
think
are
all
of
the
important
considerations,
including
the
practicalities
that
i
just
went
through,
the
four
points
that
i
just
raised
with
regard
to
mining
coal
in
1909.
in
addition,
it
relied
very
heavily
on
statements
in
the
legislative
history
that
we
think
just
cannot
bear
the
weight
that
they
were
given.
and
finally,
it
did
not
take
into
any
account
some
of
the
scientific
aspects
of
coal
that
were
known
both
in
1909
and
are
known
presently,
and
i'm
referring
to
the
joint
appendix--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--yes,
justice--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--well,
we
think
with
regard
to
those
reservations
it
was
probably
ambiguous
what
congress
was
reserving.
the
1914
act
i
think
is
the
act
that
you're
referring
to.
in
that
case,
those
were
lands
that
were
determined
not
to
contain
coal,
so
the
issue
probably
in
congress'
mind
never
would
have
come
up.
it's
our
current
position
that
under
the
1914
act,
that
certainly
the
united
states
did
reserve
the
coal,
the
methane
gas,
natural
gas
that
lies
outside
of
the
coal
seams
and,
of
course,
it's
not
clear
on
this
record
whether
there's
any
1914
lands
that
actually
do
contain--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--the
mineral
leasing
act
of
1920
dealt
with
the
question
of
disposition
of
what
had
been
previously
reserved,
so
we
don't
think
that
it
actually
touches
upon
the
issue
of
what
had
been
reserved
10
years
before.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
it
treated
gas
separately
from
coal,
but
it--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--it
did
not
make
specific
mention
of
cbm.
this
issue
did
not
really
come
to
the
forefront
until
new
technology
was
developed
to
develop
the
cbm
and,
contrary
to
what
mr.
phillips
says,
that
technology
was
not
in
existence
in
1909.
cbm
is
not
developed
through
traditional
wells.
rather,
it
requires
extensive
so
called
stimulation
of
the
coal
bed.
you
have
to
enter
the
coal
bed,
fracture
the
coal
bed,
and
inject
materials
and
remove
water
in
order
to
get
the
methane
out,
so
the
mining
techniques
for
removing
cbm
are
quite
different
from
the
techniques
for
removing
natural
gas
from
conventional
limestone.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
yes.
you
can
go
to
the
joint
appendix,
and
put
in
the
joint
appendix
in
volume
2
is
a
volume...
a
submission
that
was
provided
by
mr.
fassett,
pages
553
through
578.
he
describes
cbm
production
in
some
detail,
including
cbm
production
in
the
fruitland
formation,
which
has
some
unusual
aspects
to
it
as
well.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
i'm
not
sure--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--yes,
i
think
that
might
be
right.
now,
the
type
of
development...
i
think
that
the
fassett
article--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--it...
no,
it
does...
i
think
that
that
technology--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--i
don't
think
the
technology
had
developed
between
1909
and
1920.
the
technology
was
actually
developed
as
a
form
of
removing
natural
gas
from
so
called
tight
sands,
which
came
into
the
fore
in
the
fifties
or
sixties.
i
don't
think
there
was
any
cbm
production
whatsoever
before
1953.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
but
there
was
no
way
to
develop
cbm
in
1909.
there
was
no
way
to
develop
cbm
in
1920.
i
believe
that
the
first
commercial
development
of
cbm
took
place
in
1953.
now,
i'd
like...
i
think
that
one
thing
we
have
not
discussed
here
this
after...
this
morning
that
i
think
is
important,
and
that
is
the
response
of
the
state
courts
to
this
problem.
two
states
have
had
extensive
experience
with
this
matter,
alabama
and
pennsylvania,
and
both
of
those
courts,
applying
traditional
mining
law,
concluded
that
cbm
belongs
to
the
owner
of
the
coal
seam,
and
we
think
that's
quite
important.
these
are
states
that
have
dealt
with
the
practical
problems
of
cbm
development.
i
would
also
point
out
that
the
solicitor's
1981
opinion
did
not
have
the
benefit
of
those
two
opinions
from
those
two
courts.
now,
the
montana
court--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--yes.
those
are
both
cases
in
which
the
coal
was
conveyed
away,
and
the
question
was
whether
the
surface
owner
continued
to
own
the
gas
in
the
coal
seam,
and
in
both
of
those
cases...
and
i
think
the
pennsylvania
case
is
particularly
instructive,
the
hoge
case...
the
court
indicated
that,
well,
whatever
coal
constituent,
and
it
treated
cbm
as
a
coal
constituent,
that
is
in
the
coal
seam,
remains
part
of
the
ownership
of
that
coal
seam.
it's
common
in
hard
rock
minerals
to
view
the
ownership
of
the
deposit
as
the
ownership
of
the
strata
itself,
and
i
would
like
to
make
mention
to
the
two
cases
that
i
think
that
petitioners
have
cited
that
would
appear
to
be
contrary
authority.
one
is
the
smoot
case,
which
involved
a
seam
of
iron
pyrite--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--the
case
is
called
smoot
v.
consolidated
coal.
it
was
an
intermediate
decision
from
the
illinois
courts
in
1907.
that
was
a
case
that
dealt
with
a
seam
of
pyrite
that
was
present
in
the
coal
stratum,
and
the
pyrite
actually
had
to
be
removed
to
make
the
coal
marketable.
the
court
indicated
that
the
owner
of
the
surface
did
not
give
up
his
owner
of
his
separate
seam,
or
seam
of
pyrite,
which
ranged
from
about
1
inch
thick
down
to
about
the
thickness
of
paper,
but
it
was
clearly
discernible,
and
the
court
also
indicated
that
a
different
rule
would
apply
if
the
iron
pyrite
was,
in
fact,
intermixed
within
the
coal,
which
often
happens,
i
should
add.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
the
court
actually
referred
to
the
principle
of
appurtenances,
which
is
the
notion
that
if
you're
removing
one
material
with
another
material,
the
two
necessarily
go
together,
and
it
wasn't
the
idea
of
simply
accommodating,
which
is
what
we
sometimes
encounter
in
other
areas,
but
actually
that
it
was
a
part
of
the
coal
if
it
was
truly
intermingled.
now,
the
court's
reasoning
is,
i
have
to
say
here
it
jumps
from
one
point
to
another
and
it
requires
careful
reading,
but
i
think
you'll
find
that
that's
what
that
opinion
actually
stands
for.
the
other
state
court
decision
that
is
contrary
to
our
position
is
the
montana
supreme
court
decision
from
just
a
few
years
ago.
it
dealt
with
a
1984
coal
lease,
and
it
distinguished
the
pennsylvania
case
on
the
basis
that
that
dealt
with
a
1920
coal
deed,
and
said
that,
well,
cbm
was
not
recognized
as
valuable
in
1920,
so
the
surface
owner
would
not
have
necessarily
wanted
to
hold
onto
it.
that
same
reasoning
would
distinguish
the
1909
and
1910
acts,
so
we
think
that
actually
state
law
is
consistent
with
the
position
that
we've...
that
we
are
asserting
here,
and
that's
one
of
the
things
that
has
led
the
solicitor
to
change
his
view
on
this
matter.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
yes.
well,
the
smoot
case
is
1907,
and
that
stands
for
the
notion
that
coal
is...
exists
in
a
stratum,
and
deals
with
the
pyrite
being
in
a
separate
seam
within
the
stratum.
the
cases
that
directly
deal
with
cbm
are
the
alabama
case...
i
believe
it's
called
the
west
case,
which
was
decided
in
the
early
nineties--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--i
believe
that's
right,
yes.
yes,
those
three
cases,
the
montana
case,
which
is
called
the
carbon
county
case,
and
then
the
hoge
case,
which
is
the
pennsylvania
case.
now,
i
would
like
to
touch
upon
the
point
the
chief
justice
raised
with
regard
to
the
question
of
the
canon
of
construction
that's
applicable
here.
we
think
that
the
better
view
is
that
cbm
is
a
part
of
the
coal,
but
even
if
the
matter
is
debatable,
we
think
that
you
should
apply
the
established
rule
that
ambiguous
grants
are
interpreted
in
favor
of
continued
public
ownership
for
the
reason
that
congress
has
not
consciously
determined
whether
or
not
to
give
the
material
at
issue
up,
and
it
should
be
allowed
under
the
constitution
to
exercise
its
right
to
make
that
determination.
we
think
that
rule
applies
equally
to
the
states
and
private
persons,
because
the
reasoning
for
the
rule
is
the
same
in
each
case,
and
that
is
that
congress
is
vested
with
the
authority
to
hand
out
public
property,
and
it
should
be
given
the
opportunity
to
make
that--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--there
are
a
number
of
different
canons
that
come
into
play,
and
i
think
it's
true
that
you'll
find
that
there
are
statements
that
grants,
for
instance,
for
schools
should
be
construed
liberally,
that
grants
to
homesteaders
should
be
construed--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--because
we
think
this
is
the
statement,
this
is
the
canon
that
preserves
the
prerogatives
of
congress,
which
were
truly
important
here
for
disposing
of
the
public
property,
and
the
states'
interests
are...
will
be
reflected
in
the
congressional
decision.
if
this
material
remains
a
part
of
public
property,
then
congress
can
determine
what
to
do
with
it,
and
in
that
regard,
we
note
that
congress
has
already
acted
under
the
enzi
amendment
to
protect
the
justified
expectations
of
anyone
who
has
drilled--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--well,
i
think
that
the
current
congress
is
better
equipped
than
this
court
to
deal
with
some
of
the
issues,
the
outstanding
issues
such
as
the
safety
issues
arising
from
cbm
development
in
conjunction--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--but
they're
a
better
educated
congress.
they're
a
congress
that
knows
more
about
this
resource
that
was
not
well
understood--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--the
question
is
what
congress
intended,
and
we
said--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--yes,
and
as
i
said
before,
i
think
the
better
view
is
that
they
viewed
cbm
as
part
of
the
coal
because
it
could
not
be
separate,
it
could
not
be
separated
from
the
coal
at
that
time,
and
congress,
this
congress
can
deal,
if
that
ownership
is
retained,
with
these
problems,
and
in
fact
it
has
dealt
with
them
in
things
such
as
the
enzi
amendment,
which
has
protected
the
interests,
the
justified
expectations
of
the
states
and
the
individuals.
there's
no
reason
to
think
that
congress
cannot
make
these
decisions
wisely
through
the
democratic
process.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
in
fact,
they
have,
in
the
sense
that
they
have
disclaimed
ownership
of
that
methane
that
has
been
developed
in
the
past,
so
in
fact
those
interests
are
protected.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
in
the
past.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
it's...
i
think
that
the
enzi
opinion
respects
future
leases,
any
leases
that
will
continue
into
the
future.
if
someone
wants
to
lease,
enter
into
a
new
lease
for
cbm
development,
that
would
be
an
issue
that
congress
would
have
to
deal
with,
and
i
have
confidence
that
congress
would
deal
with
it
equitably.
it
would
take
into
consideration
the
interests
of
the
landowners,
the
coal
companies,
the
oil
companies.
this
is
an
issue
that
is
really
of
the
type
that
requires
legislative
fact
finding.
it
is
simply
an
issue
that
is
both
complex
and
there
are
many
different
issues,
and
it
is
one
that
congress
has
never
decided
and
never
addressed,
and
i
believe
that
in
our
process,
in
our
democratic
process,
it's
quite
appropriate
for
congress--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--well,
i'm
saying
that
congress
never
explicitly
addressed
it.
we
think
the
better
interpretation,
as
i
said
before,
but
it
has
to
be
an
interpretation
on
either
side
by
implication,
is
the
cbm
goes
with
the
coal.
it's
the
tail
that
goes
with
the
hide,
so
to
speak,
in
this
situation.
thank
you,
your
honor.
