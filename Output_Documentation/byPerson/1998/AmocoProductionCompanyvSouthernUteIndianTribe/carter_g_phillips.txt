mr.
carter
g.
phillips
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
issue
in
this
case
is
the
meaning
of
the
word
coal,
as
used
by
congress
in
reserving
the
right
to
mine
and
remove
coal
in
the
1910
and
1909
coal
lands
act.
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
coal
also
includes
methane
gas
that
happens
to
reside
within
the
coal
bed,
and
that
in
addition
to
the
right
to
mine
the
coal,
that
the
united
states
and
its
assignees
also
have
the
right
to
mine
and
to
remove
the
gas
from
the
coal
bed,
the
rationale
here
being
that
you
can
not
only
essentially
take
out
all
of
the
coalbed
methane,
but
that
you
can
leave
all
of
the
coal
behind.
it
seems
to
me
that
this
counterintuitive
description
of
the
rights
of
the
united
states
and
its
assignees
is
absolutely
wrong,
and
that
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
ought
to
be
reversed.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
that's
correct,
justice
souter.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
not
typically,
although
to
be
honest
with
you,
i
wish
i
could
make
more
of
that
argument,
justice
souter,
but
if
you
look
at
the
1914
act
and
its
description
of
dealing
with
gas
and
oil,
phosphate,
and
the
other
minerals
that
it
identifies
there,
it
uses
essentially
the
same
language.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
so
while
i'd
like
to
take
advantage
of
that
particular
language,
i
can't.
on
the
other
hand,
it
is
still
absolutely
clear,
i
think,
to
go
back
to
the
word
coal,
which
is
the
pivotal
term
in
this
particular
statute,
that
you
would
hardly
find
a
word
that
is
more
commonly
understood
by
the
average
individual
in
1909
and
1910.
it
was
the
source
of
energy
for
75
percent
of
this
nation's
energy,
and
congress,
according
to
this
court,
at
that
time
acted
in
a
practical
way
and
defined
the
rights
in
practical
terms
that
could
be
understood
by
average
homesteaders.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
i
don't
have
the
right
to
take
the
coal,
you're
right,
justice
scalia.
all
i
have
is
the
right
to
the
natural
gas.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
it's
my
opponents
who
claim
that
they
have
the
right
to...
that
based
on
their
right
to
the
coal,
that
they
in
fact
can
take
out
all
the
gas,
leave
all
the
coal
behind,
and
that,
what
is
to
me--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--justice
scalia,
is
the
counterintuitive
nature
of
the
argument
of
the
holding
below.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
there
is
a
fundamental
difference
between
water
and
coalbed
methane,
justice
scalia,
both
chemically
and
as
a
matter
of
law.
first
of
all,
as
you
well
would
understand,
out
in
colorado
and
in
the
west,
the
rights
to
water
are
essentially
held
by
the
states
and
the
relationship
between
the
states
and
private
parties
are
fundamentally
different
than
the
relationships
involved
in
a
litigation
like
this
one.
but
second
of
all,
the
coal...
excuse
me,
the
water
that
is
in
the
coal
is
chemically
bonded,
or
at
least
some
of
it
is
chemically
bonded
to
the
coal,
and
it
is
not
our
position
that
chemically
bonded
elements
which
are
in
fact
constituents
of
the
coal
are
subject
to
removal
by
those
who
have
rights
to
other
minerals
that
may
exist.
our
basic
point
here
is
that
coalbed
methane
is
essentially
a
physically
separate
item
that
just
happens
to
reside
within
the
coal
bed.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
it's
going
to
depend
on
the,
essentially
the
state
tort
law,
or
the
tort
law
that
would
be
applied
to
it.
in
ordinary
circumstances,
under
the
rule
of
accommodation,
each
party
with
respective
rights,
when
they
conflict
with
respect
to
particular
minerals,
has
a
certain
amount
of
right
to
get
at
their
property,
and
so
the
coal
miner
is
allowed
to--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--well,
i
think
if
they
release
the
gas
and
we
don't
assert
any
rights
to
the
gas,
we
have
no
basis
to
come
in
after--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--right.
then
the
solution
to
that
problem
is
to
say
to
the
coal
miner,
if
you
go
ahead
and
waste
the
gas
under
those
circumstances,
you
do
so
on
notice
of
the
claim,
of
our
claim
to
that
gas,
and
that
claim
is
one
that
ought
to
be
respected
by
the
courts--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--and
there
is
an
accommodation
then
that
would
be
worked
out
between
the
coal
rights
owner
and
the
gas
rights
owner.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
exactly.
it
is
precisely
the
same,
justice
kennedy.
and
justice
o'connor,
it's
no
different
from
the
surface
owner's
rights
and
the
coal
rights
owners.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
the
amount
that's
derived
from
burning
the
methane
is
negligible
as
a
scientific
matter,
so
that's
not
likely
to
be
particularly
important.
but
second
of
all,
i
mean,
the
point
of
this,
i
think,
is
to
step
back
and
say,
what
did
congress
understand
by
all
of
this
when
it
made
the
reservation
of
coal?
did
congress
mean
to
say
that
we
were
going
to
engage
in
an
extended
chemical
or
chemistry
analysis
of
this
problem,
or
did
congress
say,
look,
we
know
coal
when
we
see
coal,
and
we
know--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--coalbed
methane
when
we
know
that
because
it
comes
out
and
gets
vented
as
a
part
of
the
process
of
mining
the
coal.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
i
don't
doubt
that
they
don't...
that
there's
no
notion
that
we
have
a
right
to
make
an
argument
along
those
lines.
once
the
coal's
been
removed
and
out,
i
don't
see
that
we
have
any
basis
for
going
in
there,
but
the
more
fundamental
question
is,
do
they
have
the
right,
when
we
own
the
gas
inside
the
coal,
whether
it
is
absorbed
or
held
in
a
free
state,
to
go
in,
drill
into
that
coal
and
release
all
of
the
gas
that
otherwise
belongs
to
us,
and
our
argument
there
is
clearly
no,
you
can't.
that
cannot
be
the
rule.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--no.
there's...
i
mean,
there's
no
evidence
that
congress
had
an
understanding
that
the
coal
miner
had,
quote,
dominion
over
the
gas.
what
congress
knew
in
1909
and
'10,
just
as
we
do
today,
is
that
there
is
such
a
thing
as
coal,
and
there's
such
a
thing
as
gas,
and
that
congress
had
the
authority
to
reserve
either
coal
or
gas
or
all
of
the
minerals
or
none
of
the
minerals.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
yes.
i
mean--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--yes.
the
coal
miners
had
to
vent
the
gas
in
order
to
allow
the
mining
to
go
forward,
that's
absolutely
correct.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
you
describe
it,
justice
ginsburg,
as
control.
i
describe
it
as,
they
were
permitted
to
waste
the
gas
in
order
to
exercise
their
rights
over
the
coal.
it
didn't
have
anything
to
do
with
their,
quote,
rights
over
the
gas.
there
are
lots
of
situations
where
you
have
conflicting
property
interests,
where
your
right
is
to
waste
or
otherwise
injure
somebody
else's
property
rights
in
order,
effectively,
to
protect
your
own
ability
to
use
your
own
property.
but
what
that
doesn't
give
you
is
then
the
title
to
the
other
property,
so
if
i
go
through
the...
to
get
coal,
and
go
through
the
surface,
in
injuring
the
surface
i
don't
get
title
to
the
surface.
i'm
responsible
to
a
certain
extent,
but
i
don't
get
title
to
it.
and
the
point
here
is
that
congress
was
dealing
with
a
practical
subject
in
a
practical
way,
trying
to
decide
who
should
get
title
to
what
element,
to
what
minerals,
and
in
1909
and
1910,
congress
took
a
baby
step
in
depriving
the
patent
holders
of
their
rights
to
a
full
fee
property,
and
it
said,
we're
going
to
take
back
the
coal,
and
the
reason
it
did
that
was
for
a
very
specific
problem.
there
was
a
coal
famine
in
the
west,
and
congress
needed
the
coal.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
no,
justice
scalia.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
exactly.
and
the
reason
for
that,
justice
scalia,
is
that
the
method
of
extraction
is
identical.
the
point
of
this
is,
once
i
decrease
the
pressure,
all
of
the
gas
moves,
not
just
the
gas
that's
in
a
free
form,
but
the
gas
that's
absorbed.
the
adsorption
is
van
der
waals
forces,
which
i'm
100
percent
sure
congress
never
thought
about
in
1909,
and--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--they'd
break
immediately
upon
the
reduction
of
pressure,
and
then
the
gas
flows
out.
that's
why
it's
meaningless
to
distinguish
one
from
the
other,
because
the
extraction
process
is
identical.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
there
will
be,
at
least
for
a
few
days.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
we
own
that
methane,
but
there's
nothing
we
can
do
about
it.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
sure.
we
own
that
methane,
but
there's
nothing
we
can
do
about
that
methane,
because
again,
in
order
to
get
methane
anywhere,
just
like...
because
methane's
natural
gas.
it's
like
every
other
natural
gas
in
the
world.
it's
no
different
if
it's
in
coal,
or
if
it's
in
limestone
or
sandstone.
it's
all
chemically
the
same.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
as
i
understand
it,
i
mean,
the
reservation
of
rights
is
quite
clear
here.
congress
meant
only
to
reserve
the
coal,
and
that's
what
it
reserved,
and
the
rest
of
it,
whatever
it
happens
to
be--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--that's
correct,
and
if
you
go
back
to
the
smoot
case,
for
instance,
the
illinois
court
of
appeals
decision
that
was
rendered
at
or
around
the
early
part
of
the
20th
century,
talking
about
pyrite
and
coal,
and
they
were
both
removed,
and
one
was
a
waste
product
for
the
coal,
and
the
illinois
court
of
appeals,
relying
on
general
common
law
principles,
said
the
owner
of
the
pyrite
is
different
from
the
owner
of
the
coal.
they
are
separate
estates.
now--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--there
was
a
very
early
stage
process.
there's
some
literature
on
that.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
they
were
mining
coal,
because
that,
you
have
to
take
the
coal,
you
have
to
work
on
it.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
exactly.
we
are
not
saying
that
we
are
allowed
to
use
solvents,
which
the
government
relies
upon
as
part
of
its
argument
that
this
is
a
constituent
of
coal.
we're
not
saying
we're
allowed
to
use
heat
in
order
to
get
gas
out
of
it.
all
we're
saying
is
that
we're
allowed
to
use
the
same
simple
extraction
process
that
we
would
use
if
we
were
trying
to
get
the
gas
underneath
the
coal.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
we
can
go
right
through
the
same
coal
seam.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
i
don't
know
the
answer
to
that,
justice
kennedy.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
yes,
justice
o'connor,
and
i
think
that
reveals
plainly
congress'
ability
to
distinguish
gas
from--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--well,
if
you
look
at
the
regulatory
definition
of
gas
as
it's
implemented
in
the
coal...
i
mean,
excuse
me,
the
mineral
leasing
act
of
1920...
and
in
the
mineral
leasing
act,
remember,
congress
decides
how
it's
going
to
obtain
moneys
for
the
rights
that
it
reserved
under
both
the
1909
and
1910
acts,
and
the
1914
acts.
the
definition
of
gas
in
that
statute
absolutely
is
dead
on
with
coalbed
methane,
because
all
it's
talking
about
is
a
substance
that
in
ordinary
circumstances
will
expand
infinitely,
and
that
is
exactly
what
coalbed
methane
will
do.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
not
only
can
it
be
persuasively
shown
to
do
that,
but
the
solicitor
of
the
interior
in
1991
took
precisely
that
position
and
concluded
that
coalbed
methane
is
a
gas
deposit
within
the
meaning
of
the
mineral
leasing
act
of
1920.
that
decision
has
never
been
challenged.
that
decision
is
absolutely
correct
today,
and
that's
the
reason.
congress
has
always
known
the
difference
between
coal
and
gas,
and
has
treated
them
fundamentally
differently.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
yes,
but
that
doesn't
come
from
ordinary
property
concepts.
that
comes
from
federal
and
state
regulatory
requirements
for
the
protection
of
the
mine
workers.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
oh
absolutely,
and
we
don't
have
any
claim
to
that.
the
truth
is,
we...
the
accommodation
doctrine
will
clearly
never
give
us
the
opportunity
to
get
recovery
for
that.
i
mean,
we
can
make
an
argument
about
it,
but
you
won't
recover
for
that.
but
what
we're
talking
about
is
the
right
to
actually
mine
and
remove
the
natural
gas.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
you're
going
to
have
to
get
the
methane
out
before
you
can
mine
the
coal,
otherwise
it's
a
safety
hazard.
remember,
the
fundamental
point
here
is,
if
you
take
the
coalbed
methane
out
of
the
coal,
what
you
have
left
is
coal.
that's
why
you
know
that
this
is
not
a
constituent
of
coal.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
that's
correct.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
no.
the
basic
technology
hasn't
changed.
my
only
point
is
that
it
became
economically
feasible--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--it
was
exactly
the
same
information.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
that's
correct.
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
i'd
like
first
to
address
justice
scalia.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
questions
that
you
asked
about
the
fugacious
nature
of
the
gas
in
the
coal
demonstrates
as
plainly
as
it
can
be,
they
have
coal,
mixing
with
gas
in
three
forms,
adsorbed,
free,
and
dissolved,
they're
all
the
same,
they're
all
extracted
the
same,
there
is
no
basis
for
distinguishing
one
from
another.
justice
souter,
with
respect
to
the
means
of
extracting
it,
all
you
do
is
drill
at
anything
that
will
release
the
pressure.
now,
whether
you
can
economically
extract
it
to
the
maximum
amount
of
value
is
a
separate
issue.
all
that
arose
separately,
and
there
was
absolutely
no
change
between
1909
and
1920.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
not
at
that
time,
no,
justice
souter.
justice
kennedy,
you
asked
the
question,
because
it's
important
to
the
government's
argument,
they
keep
saying
it's
a
constituent
of
the
coal.
they
say
it
over
and
over
again.
but
if
you
look
at
545
to
555
of
the
joint
appendix,
and
you
look
from
the
macro
to
the
micro
elements
of
every
particle
of
consideration
that
the
handbook
on
coal
identifies,
you
will
never
see
ch4,
because
methane
is
not
a
constituent
of
coal.
it
is
found
within
the
coal,
which
is
why
the
government
then
turns
to
say,
well,
it's
not
the
coal,
it's
the
coal
deposit.
it's
not
the
coal
deposit,
really,
it's
the
coal
seam
and
the
coal
bed.
the
problem
is,
that's
not
the
language
of
the
statute.
the
statute
says,
coal
deposit.
deposit
was
a
well
understood
meaning
at
that
time.
it
didn't
imply
an
entire
seam
or
bed.
what
it
meant
was
that
you
had
an
identifiable
quantity
of
the
coal,
and
that's
all
congress
gave
it.
this
court
in
western
nuclear
specifically
held
that
prior
to
1916
the
regime
was
specifically
identified
minerals.
that's
coal.
it
doesn't
include
any
other
associated
minerals.
if
congress
had
wanted
to
do
that,
it
could
have
said
associated
minerals,
it
could
have
said
gas,
it
could
have
said
anything.
what
it
said
was
coal.
that's
the
right
it
has,
and
that's
the
only
right
it
has.
the
court
of
appeals
erred
in
extending
that
to
allow
these
parties
to
drill
for
gas.
thank
you,
your
honors.
