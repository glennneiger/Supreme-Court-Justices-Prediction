unknown
speaker
mr.
phillips,
you
already
brought
up
just
implicitly
in
what
you
said
an
issue
that
i
was
going
to
ask
you
to
speak
to,
and
i'll
ask
you
now.
you
spoke
of
mining
and
removing.
the
acts
involved
here,
both
1909
and
1910,
referred
to,
i
think
it
was,
what,
prospecting
mining
and
removing
the
coal?
unknown
speaker
was
the
usage
at
the
time
such
that
it
would
make
sense
to
speak
of
mining
gas?
unknown
speaker
they
used
it
generically.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
mean,
as
i
understand
it,
you
assert
the
right
not
only
to
take
out
the
methane
that...
the
gas
that
happens
to
be
in
the
coal
when
you
mine
the
coal,
you
assert
the
right
to
by
whatever
means
drill
a
hole
and
take
out
just
the
gas
and
leave
the
coal,
right?
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
what
if...
what
if--
unknown
speaker
--there's
some
water
that
adheres
to
the
coal
as
well,
i
mean,
a
certain...
that
is,
in
its
composition.
suppose
somebody
had
water
rights
to
this
land.
would
they
be
able
to
extract
the
water
from
the
coal?
unknown
speaker
well,
what
if
the
coal
miner
digs
into
the
coal
and
in
the
process
releases
this
gas
that
you
say
the
petitioner
owns?
is
the
coal
miner
liable
to
the
petitioner
for
the
release
of
that
gas?
unknown
speaker
but
as
a
practical
matter,
what
would
happen
to
the
coal
miners
who
are
trying
to
take
out
the
coal
and
at
the
same
time
releasing
gas,
if
your
position
is
correct?
unknown
speaker
well,
let's
say
you
do
assert
the
rights
to
the
gas.
that's
why
you're
here.
unknown
speaker
it's
the--
unknown
speaker
--the
same
accommodation
problem
arises
when
oil
and
gas
rights
are
owned
by
different
parties
at
different
levels.
unknown
speaker
well,
except
that
the
gas
doesn't
adhere
to
the
oil
the
way
it
adheres
to
the
coal.
i
mean,
you
can
say
he's
taken
away
your
methane
if
he
just
fills
up
a
truck
with
coal
and
carts
it
off.
it
isn't
just
that
there
are
pockets
of
gas,
as
i
understand
it.
there
is
gas
that
adheres
to
the
coal
when
he
carts
it
away,
and
indeed,
some
of
the
energy
that
is
derived
from
burning
the
coal
is,
in
fact,
derived
from
burning
the
methane.
unknown
speaker
right,
but--
unknown
speaker
--but
that's
the
point
i
was
making,
at
least
as
to
the
methane
that
is
not
in
a
pocket.
in
a
pocket,
i
think
you
make
a
strong
point
that
congress
couldn't
have
intended
that,
but
i
think
on
the
other
hand,
as
to
that
methane
that
is
not
in
a
separate
pocket
but
has
really
been...
i
guess
it
isn't
absorbed,
but
it
just
adheres
to
the
coal,
i
can't
imagine
that
congress
thought
that
when
somebody
loaded
up
a
truck
with
coal
from
his
coal
mine
he
was
stealing
your
methane.
unknown
speaker
mr.
phillips,
you
said
what...
when
congress
used
the
word
coal,
it
had
a
meaning,
and
in
1910,
if
i
were
to
put
the
question,
who
has
dominion
over
this
gas...
as
i
understand
it,
it
was
bad
gas
in
1910,
and
wouldn't
the
answer
be,
of
course
the
coal
miner
is
responsible,
has
the
care
of,
the
guard
of
that
gas,
has
dominion
over
it,
and
if
there's
an
explosion,
the
coal
owner
is
going
to
be
responsible?
wasn't
that
the
understanding
that
congress
had
in
1910--
unknown
speaker
--when
this
gas
was
not
considered
any
kind
of
an
asset?
unknown
speaker
there
had
to
be
some
control
over
this
when
it
was
a
hazardous
waste.
unknown
speaker
didn't
someone
in
1910
have
responsibility
for
handling
that
bad
gas?
unknown
speaker
so
they
had
the
control
over
the
gas
to
see
that
it
didn't
cause
injury.
unknown
speaker
now,
later--
--why
doesn't
it
make
sense
to
say
that
that
methane
which
has
been
absorbed,
as
you
put
it,
is
coal,
but
that
methane
which
is
in
pockets,
and
separate
under
the
ground,
is
not
coal?
but
that's
not
your
argument.
unknown
speaker
your
argument
is
that
all
of
it,
whether
it's--
unknown
speaker
--well,
i
certainly
didn't,
i
know.
unknown
speaker
may
i
just
follow
up
on
one
of
justice
scalia's
questions,
because
i
think
i
under...
it's
a
tough
case.
it's
a
tough
case,
there's
no
doubt
about
that.
but
supposing
your
extraction
method
allowed
you
to
take
large
lumps
of
coal
out.
i
know
often
it's
pulverized,
but
you
had
large
lumps
of
coal
where
you
use
a
pick
ax,
the
old
fashioned
way.
you
load
it
on
a
truck,
you
put
it
out
in
the
yard,
and
you
sell
it
to
a
wholesaler.
those
large
lumps
of
coal
still
have
some
methane
within
them.
am
i
right
on
that,
factually?
unknown
speaker
who
owns
that
methane?
unknown
speaker
you
still
own
that,
even
though
it's--
unknown
speaker
--and
if
a
large
piece
of
coal
happened
to
have
some
foreign
object
in
it,
whatever
it
might
be,
a
piece
of
gold,
an
old
shoe,
or
whatever
it
was,
you
would
own
that
old
shoe,
too?
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
but
not
whatever
might
be
within
a
piece
of
coal.
unknown
speaker
was
there
ever
a
commercial
practice
of
taking
the
coal,
in
the
ordinary
sense
that
we
think
of
a
lump
of
black
stuff,
and
refining
it
or
processing
it
to
get
gas?
unknown
speaker
if
that
had
happened,
would
you
have
said
that
they
were
mining
coal
or
extracting
gas?
unknown
speaker
just
like
if
you
take
timber
and
make
it
paper,
you're
taking
timber,
not
paper.
unknown
speaker
do
you
know--
unknown
speaker
--do
you
know
whether
or
not
in
the
west
virginia
and
pennsylvania
area...
maybe
you
don't
know
the
answer
to
this
question...
did
the
common
lease
say
that
the
lessee
is
entitled
to
extract
coal,
reserving
to
the
owner
all
other
minerals?
unknown
speaker
mr.
phillips,
after
the
legislation
you're
talking
about,
1909,
1910,
subsequently
congress
enacted
other
laws,
i
believe,
in
subsequent
land
grant
legislation
to
reserve
gas
estates,
did
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
what
is
the
best
indication
that
in
those
subsequent
legislation,
in
the
subsequent
legislation
reserving
gas
to
the
government,
that
it
intended
the
gas
to
include
the
coalbed
methane?
unknown
speaker
so
congress
did
later
have
legislation
that
reserved
gas
that
you
think
can
persuasively
be
shown
to
include
coalbed
methane.
unknown
speaker
mr.--
--mr.
phillips,
could
you
explain
to
me
a
little
more
about
this
accommodation,
because
am
i
right
in
thinking
that
the
coal
miner
still
must
exercise
dominion
over
that
gas,
at
least
to
the
extent
of
preventing
hazardous
conditions
in
the
mine?
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
in
doing
that,
some
of
it
may
escape.
unknown
speaker
and
how
does
it
determine
who
goes
first?
the
coal
miner
says,
i
want
to
get
out
the
coal,
and
you
say,
well,
we
want
to
get
the
methane
out
first?
unknown
speaker
in
other
words,
you
would
be
saying,
you
can't
mine
until
we
do
our
thing
first.
unknown
speaker
mr.
phillips,
i
think
you
contrasted
the
clear
advertence
of
congress
in
1920
to
coalbed
methane
as
at
least
against
the
language
that
it
used
in
the
time
we're
concerned
with
here.
was
there
any
technological
advance
during
that
period
of
time?
in
other
words,
was
there
a
way
of
extracting
coalbed
methane
in
1920
that
was
not
known,
or
at
least
had
not
been
developed
and
was
not
familiar
in
1909
and
1910?
unknown
speaker
but
they
knew
it
just
as
well
in
1909--
unknown
speaker
--as
they
did
in
1920.
unknown
speaker
mr.
davidson.
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
the
states
would
have
reacted
differently
whether
they
knew
how
this
case
would
be
decided?
unknown
speaker
everything
except
the
coal,
but
did
they
know
exactly
what
the
coal
was?
unknown
speaker
no,
but
isn't
it
at
least
conceivable
they
might
have
thought,
well,
we
get
everything
except
whatever's
in
the
coal
seam?
unknown
speaker
but
i
take
it...
i
want
to
make
sure
i
understand
one
thing.
you're
claiming
that
the
gas
that
is
to
be
distinguished
from
the
coal
is
not
only
the
gas
that
has
formed
or
collected
in
a
pocket
in
the
ground,
but
the
gas
that
can
be
extracted
from
the
coal
while
the
coal
still
is
in
the
ground,
is
that
correct?
unknown
speaker
you're
talking
about
both
kinds
of...
you're
talking
about
gas
in
both
those
aspects,
is
that
correct?
unknown
speaker
and
you
say
that's
yours.
unknown
speaker
yes,
okay.
unknown
speaker
you
say
the
gas
even
in
the
lump
of
coal
that's
on
the
cart
is
technically
yours,
although
there's
nothing
you
can
do
about
it,
but
you
say
that's
yours,
too.
unknown
speaker
but
the
doctrine
of
reasonable
accommodation
takes
account
of
that,
presumably--
unknown
speaker
--and
protects
the
miner
of
the
hard
coal.
unknown
speaker
mr.
davidson,
am
i
right
in
thinking,
in
relation
to
your
opening
remarks,
that
the
states,
when
they
came
into
the
union,
as
this
was
an
inducement,
could
not
have
been
contemplating
the
asset
of
this
gas,
because
practically
there
was
no
way
economically
that
it
could
be
extracted?
unknown
speaker
thank
you,
mr.
davidson.
mr.
shipps,
we'll
hear
from
you.
unknown
speaker
if
the
methane
comes
out
in
drilling,
as
in
gaseous
form,
and
i'm
a
chemistry
student,
is
the
formula
for
the
methane
gas
the
same
as
the
formula
for,
say,
hard
anthracite
coal?
unknown
speaker
but
if
you're
describing
the
coal
in
chemical
terms,
you'd
have
to
add
a
lot
of
other
chemical
descriptions.
unknown
speaker
it's
always
hard,
though.
unknown
speaker
--look
at
a
glass
of
fluid
and
say
that's
coal,
or,
you
know,
a
balloon
filled
with
some
gas
and
say
it's
filled
with
coal.
unknown
speaker
but
that's
an
important
point.
if
black
acre
has
coal
in
the
hard
form,
and
it's
right
next
to
white
acre,
and
white
acre
does
not
have
any
coal
in
extractable
solid
form,
and
you
drill
on
white
acre,
and
you
begin
draining
gas
from
the
adjacent
coal
field,
are
you
in
white
acre?
are
you
taking
coal?
that's
your
position,
it
seems
to
me.
unknown
speaker
well,
but
in
common
sense
terms,
under
your
theory
you
are
taking
coal.
unknown
speaker
i
read
your
brief.
unknown
speaker
well,
the
federal
government
didn't
adopt
your
position
until
very
recently,
until
this
thing
became
valuable,
and
until
then
the
federal
government
took
the
position
urged
by
mr.
phillips.
unknown
speaker
well,
they've
danced--
unknown
speaker
--they've
danced
all
around
the
maypole
on
it.
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
at
the
time...
at
the
time
that
it
became
necessary
to
rely
on
alternative
energy
forms
and
it
appeared
that
coalbed
methane
gas
was
valuable,
the
government
actively
encouraged
people
to
take
the
position
that
the
cbm
was
not
part
of
the
coal,
and
to
develop
it,
and
gave
them
tax
incentives
to
do
so,
and
now
it
takes
a
position
like
yours,
but
it
certainly
didn't.
unknown
speaker
well,
the
attorneys
for
the
federal
agencies
dealing
with
it
certainly
took
that
position.
unknown
speaker
no,
i
don't
think
it
is.
they
acknowledge
that
any
easement
for
extraction
implies
reasonable
methods
of
extracting,
and
if
you
must
take
some
gas
that
adheres
to
the
coal,
that's
just
a
reasonable
exercise
of
your
right
to
excavate,
but
that's
far
different
from
saying
that
you
own
all
the
gas
that's
in
free
form
and
that
remains.
that's
quite
different.
unknown
speaker
but
the
coal
that's
ultimately
extracted
is
in
no
way
less
valuable,
is
it,
because
there
has
been
a
drilling
that
preceded
the
extraction
of
the
coal?
it
might
be
more
difficult
and
expensive
to
extract
the
coal,
but
the
coal
itself
is
no
less
valuable,
is
it?
unknown
speaker
i
want
to
be
very
clear
on
this.
two
cases.
one
case
where
there's
no
extraction
of
gas,
and
the
coal
is
mined,
and
the
methane
is
flared
off,
and
there's
a
lump
of
black,
solid
coal.
case
1.
case
2,
there
has
been
drilling
previously,
and
the
black,
solid
coal
is
thereafter
removed.
in
your
submission,
the
coal
in
the
latter
instance
is
less
valuable?
unknown
speaker
is
there
anything
in
the
record--
unknown
speaker
--well,
but
then
again,
that
assumes
the
answer
on
your
part.
unknown
speaker
mr.
shipps--
unknown
speaker
--i
don't
know
enough
about
mining
techniques.
suppose
there's
a
pool
of
oil
under
my
neighbor's
land,
and
just
a
little
bit
of
it
comes
onto
my
land,
can
i
sink
a
well
and
suck
out
all
of
his
oil?
is
that
all
my
oil?
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
in
every
state
of
the
union
you
can
drain?
gee,
i
didn't
think--
unknown
speaker
--that's
not...
some
states
you
can
drain,
some
states
you
can't.
unknown
speaker
but
haven't
state
regulators
changed
the
common
law
in
that
regard
with
unitization
and
that
sort
of
thing,
so
that
you
no
longer
can,
even
if
the
common
law
allows
you,
simply
drill
straight
down
and
drain
your
neighbor's
pool?
unknown
speaker
when
were
those
rules
and
regulations
adopted?
unknown
speaker
well,
they
scarcely,
then,
speak
to
the
intent
of
congress
in
1910,
i
take
it.
unknown
speaker
well,
you
say
that
they
cannot
be
one
producing
zone
anymore,
so
that
if
you
have,
let's
say,
a
pool
of
methane
that
is
surrounded
by
limestone,
but
it
is
contiguous
to
a
coal
bed,
you
wouldn't
be
allowed
to
drain...
you
would
say
they're
taking
away
your
coal,
that
they
have
no
right
to
that
methane
even
though
it's
fugacious.
unknown
speaker
no,
but
they're
doing
it
next
door.
they're
doing
it
next
door.
they
drill
a
well,
and
they
get
out
the...
a
pocket
of
methane,
but
as
we've
heard,
what
will
happen
is,
that
pocket
will
suck
the
methane
out
of
your
coal.
unknown
speaker
but
you
say
it's
not
fugacious
gas.
you
say
it's
your
coal.
you
say
it
shouldn't
be
treated
the
way
oil,
a
pool
of
oil
is,
or
a
pocket
of
gas,
that
traverses
two
properties.
you're
saying,
this
methane
in
my
coal
is
coal.
it's
my
coal,
it's
not
your
gas
or
anybody's
gas,
right?
unknown
speaker
so
we
have
to
have
some
new
rules
for
what
you
do
when
you
drill
into
a
pocket
of
methane
if
you're
sucking
it
off
of
somebody's
coal.
unknown
speaker
they're
not
drilling
into
your
coal
deposit.
they're
drilling
into
this
pocket
of
methane.
your
coal
deposit
is
next
door.
unknown
speaker
this
methane
comes
up,
they
take
the
methane,
but
it--
unknown
speaker
--they're
capturing
your
coal,
is
your
theory.
they
are
not
capturing
methane.
unknown
speaker
suppose
that
it
is
commercially
feasible
to
extract
the
methane
without
affecting
the
value
of
the
coal
estate.
unknown
speaker
is
it
still
coal
under
your
theory?
unknown
speaker
well,
then,
that's
just
a
question
of
the
law
of
reasonable
accommodation.
unknown
speaker
it
would
seem
to
me
a
very
strange
way
to
do
it,
to
conflate
the
definition
of
gas
and
coal.
unknown
speaker
thank
you,
mr.
shipps.
mr.
minear,
we'll
hear
from
you.
unknown
speaker
mr.
minear,
sometime
during
your
argument,
mr.
davidson
suggested
that
the
principle
you
relied
on
that
at
the
point
of
where
a
grant
is
ambiguous
it
is
resolved
in
favor
of
the
government
does
not
apply
where
the
grant
is
to
a
state,
and
he
cited
the
case
of
wyoming
v.
united
states.
sometime
during
your
argument,
could
you
address
that?
unknown
speaker
well,
it
certainly
wasn't
the
position
of
the
government's
lawyers
back
when
all
of
a
sudden
it
was
discovered
that
the
coalbed
methane
gas
was
valuable
and
its
development
should
be
encouraged.
unknown
speaker
which
was
withdrawn,
as
i
recall,
after
this
litigation
began.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
thought
maybe
it
had
something
to
do
with
the
fact
that
all
of
a
sudden
it
was
valuable
and
the
federal
government
thought
it
would
like
to
have
that
value.
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
well,
congress,
after
the
1909-1910
acts,
later
passed
legislation
dealing
with
federal
land
grants
reserving
gas
in
some
circumstances
to
the
federal
government.
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
it
thought
then
it
was
reserving
coalbed
methane
gas?
unknown
speaker
what
about
the
mineral
leasing
act
of
1920?
unknown
speaker
but
congress
did
treat
this
sort
of
thing
separately
from
coal.
unknown
speaker
it
treated
cbm
as
a
gas,
did
it
not?
unknown
speaker
where
do
we
go
to
read
about
this
development
in
technology
from
1909
to
1920?
could
you
give
me
a
good
source?
unknown
speaker
but
does
he
describe
the
development
of
the
technology
in
this
period?
unknown
speaker
that's
what's
important
to
me,
because
if
the...
you
know,
for
obvious
reasons.
if
the
technology
has
developed,
you're
going
to
draw
a
very
different
inference,
i
think,
from
the
use
of
the
language
in
1920
from
what
would
be
the
case
if
there
had
been
no
development
in
the
technology.
unknown
speaker
so
does
this...
does
the
period...
the
material
in
the
joint
appendix
describe
that
technological
development
in
that
period
of
roughly
11
years?
unknown
speaker
all
right.
where
will
i
find
that?
where
will
i
find
that?
unknown
speaker
so
mr.
phillips
was
right,
then,
in
his
statement
to
me
that
there
had
been
no
technological
change
during
that
period
of
time.
unknown
speaker
did
those
arise
because
the
owners
attempted
to
dispose
of
the
estate
separately
after
they'd
made
a
previous
conveyance
of
the
coal
right,
or--
unknown
speaker
--what's
the
name
of
the
case,
mr.
minear?
unknown
speaker
is
that
because
of
the
notion
of
accommodation
principles?
unknown
speaker
are
all
the
state
cases...
what
are
the
dates
of
them?
are
they
all
after
1953?
unknown
speaker
these
are
on
page
36
of
your
brief,
footnote
26?
unknown
speaker
you
say
then,
mr.
minear,
that
mr.
davidson
is
wrong
in
citing
wyoming
v.
united
states
for
the
proposition
that
he
cited
it
for?
unknown
speaker
well,
why
shouldn't
they...
you
know,
if
you
want
to
say
a
number
of
different
statements,
the
things
that
you're
relying
on
are
statements
also.
why
should
one
statement
be
elevated
over
another?
unknown
speaker
no,
but
it's
not
the
congress
now
that
it
was
then.
the
congress
then
was
giving
away
public
lands
and
was
giving
away
public
minerals.
to
say
no
harm's
done
if,
you
know,
we
interpret
the
ambiguous
thing
the
wrong
way,
congress
will
fix
it,
it's
a
different
congress.
it's
not
the
same
congress.
it
seems
to
me
we
ought
to
just
take
our
best
shot
at
resolving
the
ambiguity.
i
don't
know
any
basis
for
saying,
you
know,
no
harm
done.
it's
a
100-year-old
congress.
unknown
speaker
but
they
won't
make
the
same
decision.
i
mean,
to
say
that
they
would
make
the
same
decision
that
a
1909
congress
would
is
simply
false.
unknown
speaker
well,
you're
just
saying
that
if
we
decide
the
case
in
your
favor,
maybe
congress
will
do
something
equitable,
but
that
certainly
isn't
the
question
before
us.
unknown
speaker
what
the
congress
in
1909
and
1910
intended.
unknown
speaker
can
they
get
back
the
money
that
on
the
assumption
that
was
adopted
in
the
1981
opinion
some
companies
have
invested
in
getting
gas
rights
that
now
no
longer
exist?
can
congress
fix
that
up?
unknown
speaker
in
the
past.
unknown
speaker
but
they
paid
for
rights
to
take
it
out
in
the
future,
as
well.
unknown
speaker
well,
if
congress
never
decided
it,
then
you're
saying
that
the
1909
things
didn't...
don't
speak
one
way
or
the
other
to
it?
unknown
speaker
thank
you,
mr.
minear.
mr.
phillips,
you
have
2
minutes
remaining.
unknown
speaker
there
was
no
economic
extraction,
then,
in
that
period.
unknown
speaker
the
honorable
court
is
now
adjourned
until
tomorrow
at
ten
o'clock.
