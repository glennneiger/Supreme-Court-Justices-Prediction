the
industrial
revolution
needed
fuel
and
in
the
second
half
of
the
19th
century
the
principle
fuel,
the
principle
energy
source,
was
coal,
coal
bed,
as
everyone
knows,
were
in
great
abundance
in
the
united
states.
the
early
land-grant
program
by
which
federal
lands
were
granted
to
homesteaders,
made
a
distinction
between
lands
with
coal
and
lands
without
it
and
different
terms
and
conditions
applied
to
those
who
wanted
to
settle
and
acquire
ownership
in
the
two
sorts
of
lands.
then
there
occurred
two
events:
one
was
what
was
thought
to
be
in
any
event
a
coal
famine
in
the
western
states;
the
second
was
the
disclosure
of
widespread
fraud
and
abuse
in
which
some
lands
obtain
by
entry
and
settlement
under
the
representation
that
no
coal
existed,
really
did
have
coal.
to
correct
the
widespread
fraud
the
government
ordered
withdrawal
from
the
public
lands
of
some
64
million
acres
and
this
affected
even
some
lands
where
settlers
and
homesteaders
had
already
made
entry.
this
outraged
the
settlers
--
many
perhaps
most
of
them
had
entered
the
lands
in
good
faith
and
who
were
seeking
the
perfect
title.
after
three
years
of
inconclusive
or
congressional
debates
and
various
legislative
proposals
which
failed
of
adoption,
the
coal
acts
of
1909
and
1910
were
adopted
by
the
congress
and
signed
by
the
president.
the
acts
provided
for
purposes
of
this
brief
explanation
that
is
to
lands
granted
and
lands
yet
to
be
granted,
the
united
states
reserve
to
itself
the
ownership
of
the
coal.
now
the
acts
did
not
mention
the
gas
within
the
coal
beds,
most
coal
beds
have
gas
and
are
commonly
known
as
coal
bed
methane
or
cbm,
as
the
opinion
uses
the
phrase.
in
early
days
the
gas
was
considered
nuisance
and
indeed
all
to
have
frequently
there
were
explosions
that
were
caused
by
the
gas,
but
in
later
years
it
became
clear
that
the
gas
was
itself
a
valuable
fuel
resource.
this
case
presents
the
issue
whether
the
statutes
which
reserved
coal
and
that’s
the
word
used
in
statutes
to
the
united
states
by
necessary
extension
or
influence
also
reserved
the
coal
bed
methane.
some
20
million
acres
of
lands
were
granted
pursuant
to
the
reservation
of
coals,
so
these
cases
have
some
consequences.
the
petitioner
here
is
amoco,
a
class
representative,
amoco
and
here
the
petitioners
abought
the
right
to
explore
for
gas
on
the
assumption
that
it
had
not
been
reserved.
the
government
and
in
this
case
successor
in
interest
the
southern
ute
indian
tribe
say,
that
the
gas
belongs
to
the
government
or
to
the
tribe
and
not
to
amoco
because
it
was
retained
under
the
coal
clause.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
tenth
circuit
held
that
the
reservation
of
coal
was
effective
to
reserve
the
gas
as
well.
we
disagree,
and
we
rule
in
favor
of
the
petitioners.
in
today’s
opinion
we
point
out
that
an
interpreting
statutory
mineral
reservations
like
the
on
at
issue
here
congress
was
dealing
with
a
practical
subject
in
a
practical
way
and
that
it
intended
the
terms
of
the
reservation
to
be
understood
in
their
ordinary
and
popular
sense.
now,
we
are
persuaded
that
their
common
conception
of
coal
at
the
time
congress
passed
the
1909
and
1910
acts
was
the
solid
rock
substance
that
was
the
country’s
primary
energy
resource.
respondents
say
we
should
not
create
or
interpret
the
acts
to
create
a
split
estate
with
one
owner
of
gas
and
another
owner
of
coal,
but
split
estates
were
already
common
at
the
time
of
the
1909
and
1910
acts.
there
is
an
established
common
law
right
of
the
owner
of
one
mineral
estate
to
use
and
sometimes
even
to
damage
and
neighboring
a
estate
as
necessary
and
reasonable
on
the
extraction
of
the
owners
own
minerals.
the
common
law
has
proved
adequate
to
the
task
of
resolving
the
resulting
conflicts
between
the
estates
and
there
is
no
reason
they
think
that
the
prospect
of
the
split
estate
would
have
deterred
congress
from
reserving
only
the
coal
and
not
the
gas.
even
were
we
to
construe
the
coal
clause
to
include
coal
bed
methane
gas,
that
is
the
savings
fuel
to
adopt
the
government’s
position,
a
split
estate
would
result
in
any
event.
now,
the
methane
gas
often
migrates
to
surrounding
rock
formations
with
natural
gas
and
the
split
gas
estate
would
be
at
least
difficult
to
administer
as
a
split
coal
and
gas
state.
for
these
and
other
reasons
given
in
the
opinion,
we
reserve
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals.
justice
ginsburg
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion.
justice
breyer
took
no
part
in
the
consideration
or
decision
of
the
case.
