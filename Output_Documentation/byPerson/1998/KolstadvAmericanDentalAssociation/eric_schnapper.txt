mr.
eric
schnapper
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
1991
civil
rights
act
made
several
fundamental
changes
in
the
method
of
enforcing
title
vii
and
the
americans
with
disabilities
act.
section
1981a(a)
authorizes
awards
of
punitive
damages
if
punitive
or
compensatory
damages
are
sought,
and
either
party
has
a
statutory
right
to
trial
by
jury.
the
determination
of
whether
punitive
damages
should
be
awarded
proceeds
in
two
distinct
stages.
first,
section
1981a
establishes
several
statutory
prerequisites
which
must
be
satisfied
before
a
jury
or,
in
the
case
of
a
bench
trial,
a
judge,
is
authorized
to
consider
an
award
of
punitive
damages.
satisfaction
of
the
statutory
requirements
only
permits,
but
does
not
require,
an
award
of
such
damages.
mr.
eric
schnapper
that
is
not
our
position.
our
position
is
that
there
must
be
proof
of
either
reckless
indifference
or
malice.
and
there
are
a
number--
mr.
eric
schnapper
--not
necessarily.
there
are
a
wide
variety
of
circumstances
under
title
vii,
as
well
as
the
ada,
in
which
one
might
have
intentional
discrimination,
but
not
reckless
disregard.
because,
for
example--
mr.
eric
schnapper
--of
the...
of
the
rights...
the
federally
protected
rights
of
the
plaintiff.
mr.
eric
schnapper
i'm
sorry...
reckless
indifference.
i
misspoke.
that
is
the
statutory
standard:
reckless
indifference.
mr.
eric
schnapper
but
there...
there
could
be
circumstances,
as
was
true
in
the
hazen
case,
in
which
the...
for
example,
the
law
was
sufficiently
unclear
as
to
whether
or
not
a
particular
act
of
discrimination,
although
technically
intentional,
was,
nonetheless,
illegal.
the
court
noted
in
hazen,
for
example,
that
there
was
a
bfoq
exception
under
the
adea,
the
same
exception
as
this--
mr.
eric
schnapper
--well,
it...
it's
a
little
bit
analogous.
and
i
think
the
standard
is
not
as...
as
stringent
as
for
qualified
immunity.
but--
mr.
eric
schnapper
--if...
if
you
had
a
situation
in
which...
the
standard
that
we
propose
with
regard
to
reckless
indifference
is
that
the
defendant
either
knew
or
should
reasonably
have
known
that
what
it
was
doing
was
probably
illegal.
now,
there
are
circumstances
involving
intentional
discrimination
where
you
couldn't
say
that.
mr.
eric
schnapper
the...
the
statutory
standard
for...
for
punitive
damages
in
many
title
vii
cases
will,
as
a
practical
matter,
be
satisfied
by
proof
of
intent,
but
not
all.
the
standard
is
different.
and...
but
i
think
we...
we
would
acknowledge
that--
mr.
eric
schnapper
--i'm
sorry.
mr.
eric
schnapper
well,
i...
i...
i
think
the
textual
answer
is
yes.
i'm...
i'm
reflecting
over
the
legislative
history.
and
it's...
i
can't--
mr.
eric
schnapper
--no,
no,
no.
mr.
eric
schnapper
no.
i'm...
i'm...
insofar
as
the...
the
intent
of
congress
is...
is
to
be
inferred
from
the
language
of
the
statute,
the
statute
sets
a
different
standard.
mr.
eric
schnapper
if
that's
a
question
about...
about
whether
it
was
debated,
i
think
i
purport
it
was
not.
mr.
eric
schnapper
it
does
not
require
any
knowledge
of
the
law
for
there
to
be--
mr.
eric
schnapper
--yes,
it
would
require
either
knowledge
or...
or,
as
the
court
said,
i
think,
in
mclaughlin,
recklessness
in
determining
what
the
defendants
knew
their
obligations
were.
mr.
eric
schnapper
yes.
mr.
eric
schnapper
the...
the...
the
difference,
your
honor,
as
we
formulate
the
standard,
is
that
the
knowledge
required
here
is
that
the
action
is
probably
illegal.
under
qualified
immunity,
there
would
have
to
be
a
clearly
established
right.
so,
that's
a...
that's
a
higher--
mr.
eric
schnapper
--if...
if,
in
a
particular--
mr.
eric
schnapper
--your
honor,
if...
if
there
was
a
question
as
to
whether
or
not
the
action
was
probably
illegal,
our
view
is
that
that
would
be
a
question
the
judge
would
have
to
decide.
mr.
eric
schnapper
the
defendant's
knowledge
or
the
defendant's
lack
of
care
in
ascertaining
the
law
would
be
jury
questions.
mr.
eric
schnapper
but
the
question
of
whether
or
not...
what
the
state
of
the
law
in
fact
was--
mr.
eric
schnapper
--no.
i...
i
had
not
yet
come
to
that
separate
clause.
our
view
is
that
malice
can
be
satisfied
by
proof
of
one
of
three
things:
ill
will,
an
intent
to
injure,
or
an
attempt
to
violate
the
statute.
those
are
the...
those
are
the
concept
of
evil
motive
that
are
in
this
court's
opinion
in
smith
v.
wade.
mr.
eric
schnapper
i
think
a
desire
that
the
victim
be
injured
is
not
necessarily
present
in...
in
a
case
like
this,
where
the
defendant
has
been
found
to
have
preferred
to
hire...
to
promote
mr.
spangler
because
he's
a
man.
that
doesn't
necessarily
mean
they
wanted
the...
the
plaintiff
to...
to...
to
suffer.
mr.
eric
schnapper
yes,
your
honor.
we've
set
out
in
our
briefs
some
15
different
kinds
of
circumstances
in
which
that
might
arise,
simply
on
the
face
of
the
statute,
questions
about
whether
the
defendant,
for
example,
under
walters,
was
covered
by
the
statute,
questions
about
other
circumstances
in
which,
for
example,
religion/conscience
decisions
are
legal
under
the
statute
for
certain
defendants.
and
there
are,
in
addition
to
the
specific
statutory
issues
that
we
noted
there,
there
continue
to
be
issues
that
arise
in
the
lower
courts
as
to
whether
particular
practices
which
are
intentionally
discriminatory
are
nonetheless
legal
under
title
vii.
what--
mr.
eric
schnapper
--yes.
but
let
me...
let
me
explain
why
i
say
yes
to
that
with
reference
to
the
two
distinct
stages
of
determination
on
punitive
damages.
the
circumstances
that
you
describe
would
not
be
relevant
to
the
statutory
prerequisite,
but
they
would
be
relevant
to
the
discretion
the
jury
has
to
exercise
in
deciding
whether
to
award
punitive
damages.
mr.
eric
schnapper
well,
at
this
point
in
time,
with
regard
to
the
second
phase,
the...
the
practices
vary
quite
widely
as
to
whether
juries
are
in
fact
given
much
guidance
as
to
how
to
exercise
that
discretion.
but
certainly
it
would
be
appropriate
in
the
case
that
you
describe
to
advise
the
jury
that
that
would
be
a
factor
the
jury
could
consider,
and
it
would
militate
against
punitive
damages.
mr.
eric
schnapper
we
don't
believe
so.
but
i
should
start
by
saying
that's
not
an
issue
in
this
case.
in
this
case,
the
culpable
officials
included
the
executive
director
of
the
defendant,
the
highest
ranking
official
they
had.
mr.
eric
schnapper
allen.
mr.
eric
schnapper
i
think,
if...
if
one
were
to
look
only
at
agency
principles,
even...
even
wheat
would
be
high
enough.
but...
but
if
i
could
respond
in
some
more
detail
to
that.
mr.
eric
schnapper
yes.
mr.
eric
schnapper
that's
exactly
right.
i...
i
think
that
mechanically
carrying
over
here
the
principles
of
agency
law
with
regard
to
punitive
damages
would
not
be
appropriate
for...
for
two
distinct
reasons.
and
i
note,
to
begin
with,
that
this
court
indicated
in
faragher
and
ellerth
that...
that
these
kinds
of
issues
had
to
be
determined
both
by
looking
at
agency
law
and
by
looking
at
the
purposes
and
principles
underlying
title
vii.
there
are
two
reasons
that
i...
i
suggest
that...
that
one
couldn't
mechanically
use
agency
principles.
the
first
one
is
that
one
of
the
central
purposes
that
prompted
congress
to
adopt
punitive
damages
was
to
assure
more
effective
monetary
relief
to
deter
and
punish
discrimination
in
the
cases
of
sexual
harassment.
if
one
were
to
apply
mechanically
provisions
of
the
restatement
of
torts
to
sexual
harassment,
it
would...
it
would
be
a
rare
case,
if
ever,
that
you
could
get--
mr.
eric
schnapper
--because--
mr.
eric
schnapper
--let
me...
let
me
take
another
try
at
answering
this.
with
regard
to
the
first
part
of
your
question,
how
would
you
know
that,
reading
the
statute?
the
stat...
statute
has
statements
of...
of
purpose
and
findings,
which
both
refer
to
the
need
for
additional
remedies
about
sexual
harassment.
with
regard...
a
bit
of
an
aside
to
wheat...
it's
not
under
prevailing
law,
at
least
in
the
lower
courts...
it's
not
possible
to
sue
individuals
for
compensatory
and
punitive
damages.
it's
the
employer
or
nobody.
the...
in
addition
to--
mr.
eric
schnapper
--well,
in
this
case,
i
would
hope
i
could
persuade
even
justice
scalia,
because
this
is
in
fact
in
the
text
of
the
statute.
it's
not
in
section
1981a;
it
is
in
the...
in
the...
in
the
public
law
that
was
adopted
by
congress.
in...
in
addition
to
that,
the...
i'd
note
that
the...
the
statute,
on
its
face--
mr.
eric
schnapper
--i...
i
believe
that's
right.
it...
it's
been
the
public
law--
mr.
eric
schnapper
--thank
you,
your
honor.
i'd
like
to
reserve--
mr.
eric
schnapper
--i
think
that's...
i
think
that's
probably
the
right...
correct
reading.
our
view
is
that
that
issue
would
not
go
to
the
statutory
prerequisite,
it
would
only
go
to
a
guideline
for
the
jury.
thank
you.
mr.
eric
schnapper
i'd
like
to
respond
to
a
number
of
the
questions
that
have
been
asked
by
the
court
by
returning
to
the
distinction
i
made
at
the
outset
between
the
statutory
prerequisites
and
instructions
that
might
be
given
to
guide
the
discretion
of
the
jury.
section
1981a
sets
forth
two
and
only
two
prerequisites:
intent,
first;
and,
second,
either
reckless
indifference
or
malice.
we
don't
think
that
the
courts
are
at
liberty
to
add
a
third
prerequisite
to
that
list.
the
statute
says
that
if
those
requirements
are
met,
punitive
damages
may
be
awarded.
now,
a
number
of
the
concerns
the
court
raised
i
think
could
properly
be
contained
in
guidance
that
would
shape
the
jury's
exercise
of
its
discretion,
but
that's
fundamentally
different.
to
return,
for
example,
to
the
question
put
to
me
by
justice
scalia,
section
909
of
the
restatement
of
torts
contains
very
specific
requirements,
under
agency
principles,
for
the
imposition
of
punitive
damages.
none
of
them
are
in
the
statute.
the
statute
does
not
say
indifference,
reckless
indifference,
intent,
and
compliance
with
the
principles
of
the
restatement
of
agency--
mr.
eric
schnapper
--you
weren't...
you
weren't
dealing
with
this
specific
statute,
which
is...
is
quite--
mr.
eric
schnapper
--i--
mr.
eric
schnapper
--i
think
that
the
text
of
the
statute
does...
does
provide
some
guidance.
mr.
eric
schnapper
i
don't
want
to
characterize
six
members
of
the
d.c.
court
of
appeals
as
unreasonable.
but,
in
all
fairness,
the
words
"reckless
indifference"
could
not
possibly
mean
egregious
conduct.
that's
simply
not
within
the
range
of...
of
possible
means
of
those
words.
mr.
eric
schnapper
i
certainly
wouldn't
want
to
disagree
with
you
as
to
whether
that's
plausible.
but...
but
i
think,
in
all
fairness,
that
congress
has
specifically
address
the
prerequisites
in...
in
the
statute.
and
it's
spelled
out,
too--
mr.
eric
schnapper
--either
way,
i
don't
think
the
court
is...
is
free
to
add
to
them,
and
i
don't
think
egregious
conduct
is
a
possible
interpretation
of...
of
any
provision
in
the
statute.
mr.
eric
schnapper
i...
i
think
that
that
really
is
a
stretch
of
the
language.
when
congress
says
"punitive
dam"...
if
congress
had
said
you
can
award
punitive
damages,
it
might
make
sense
to
look
to
the
common
law
for
standards.
but
when
congress
goes
ahead
and
spells
out
the
standards
that
it
has
in
mind,
i
don't
think
it's
appropriate
to
add
to
them.
mr.
eric
schnapper
it
did
not.
mr.
eric
schnapper
i
would
agree,
your
honor.
