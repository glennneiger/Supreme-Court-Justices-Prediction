the
third
case
for
announcement
today
is
kolstad
versus
american
dental
association,
no.
98-208.
this
case
comes
on
appeal
from
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
circuit.
in
1992,
petitioner
carole
kolstad
sought
a
promotion
from
respondent,
her
employer.
after
the
promotion
went
to
a
male
co-worker,
petitioner
filed
suit
in
federal
district
court
alleging
she
had
been
a
victim
of
gender
discrimination
in
violation
of
title
vii
of
the
civil
rights
act
of
1964.
the
jury
found
that
the
employer
violated
title
vii
in
this
case,
but
the
district
court
denied
the
petitioner's
request
for
a
jury
instruction
on
punitive
damages.
the
en
banc
court
of
appeals
upheld
this
decision
concluding
that
jury
should
be
permitted
to
render
punitive
damages
awards
under
title
vii,
only
in
cases
involving
some
egregious
misconduct
by
the
employer.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
of
the
court
today,
we
vacate
the
court
of
appeals'
decision
and
remand
for
further
proceedings.
with
the
passage
of
the
civil
rights
act
of
1991,
compensatory
and
punitive
damages
are
now
available
under
title
vii
and
under
the
americans
with
disabilities
act.
punitive
damages,
however,
are
available
only
in
cases
involving
intentional
discrimination
and
where
it
has
proven
that
the
employer
acted
with
malice
or
with
reckless
indifference
to
a
plaintiff's
federally
protected
rights.
while
the
varied
structure
of
the
1991
act's
remedial
scheme
suggests
an
intent
to
allow
for
punitive
awards
only
in
a
subset
of
cases
involving
intentional
discrimination.
there
is
no
statutory
requirement
that
the
employer
have
engaged
in
egregious
or
outrageous
misconduct
to
be
liable
for
punitive
damages,
rather
the
statute
focuses
on
the
employer's
state
of
mind,
its
malice
or
reckless
indifference.
relying
on
our
decision
in
smith
against
wade,
we
understand
this
language
to
limit
punitive
awards
to
cases
where
the
employer
has
discriminated
in
the
face
of
a
perceived
risk
that
its
actions
will
violate
federal
law.
moreover
the
petitioner,
the
plaintiff
must
impute
the
requisite
malice
or
reckless
indifference
to
the
respondent
itself.
where
the
employer
is
a
corporation
or
association
rather
than
an
individual,
we
have
said
that
congress
intends
for
the
courts
to
rely
on
agency
principles
in
interpreting
title
vii.
common
law
rules
of
agency
place
limits
on
the
extent
to
which
an
employer
may
be
liable
in
punitive
damages
for
the
misdeeds
of
its
employees.
for
example,
in
the
punitive
damages
context
restatement
of
agency
limits
the
principles
by
curious
liability
to
instances
in
which
the
principle
authorizes
or
ratifies
the
agent's
tortuous
conduct
or
the
principle
acts
recklessly
in
employing
the
agent
or
an
agent
acting
in
a
managerial
capacity
commits
the
act
while
serving
in
the
scope
of
employment.
although,
the
restatement
further
provides
that
acts
specifically
forbidden
by
the
employer
may
fall
within
the
scope
of
an
agent?s
employment.
strict
adherence
to
this
rule
would
likely
undermine
title
vii's
goal
of
encouraging
employers
to
implement
antidiscrimination
policies.
we
accordingly
hold
that
an
employer
is
not
subject
to
a
punitive
damages
award,
based
on
the
discriminatory
acts
of
its
agents
where
those
acts
run
contrary
to
employers'
good
faith
efforts
to
comply
with
title
vii.
relief
or
remand,
the
question
whether
a
petitioner
can
show,
in
this
case
the
requisite
malice
or
reckless
indifference
on
the
part
of
the
respondents
employees,
and
if
so
whether
this
state
of
mind
maybe
imputed
to
the
respondent
itself?
