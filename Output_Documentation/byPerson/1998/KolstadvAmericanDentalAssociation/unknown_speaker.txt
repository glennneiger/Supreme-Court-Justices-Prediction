unknown
speaker
well,
is
it
your
position...
and
i
take
it
that
it
is...
that
every
case
of
intentional
discrimination
should
at
least
go
to
the
jury
on
the
question
of
punitives?
unknown
speaker
well,
does
proof
of
intentional
discrimination
suffice
for
a
jury
to
find
punitives?
unknown
speaker
reckless
disregard
of
what?
unknown
speaker
and
where
do
you
get
that
out
of
the
statute...
that
it
should
be
reckless
disregard
of--
unknown
speaker
--but
one
ordinarily
thinks
that
intentional
is
a
higher
level
of...
of
mens
rea
than
recklessness.
and
so...
but
in...
in
this
statute,
you
have
to
find
intentional
discrimination
to
find
liability.
unknown
speaker
so,
it's
kind
of
like
qualified
immunity
in
a--
unknown
speaker
--but,
mr....
i'm
sorry--
unknown
speaker
--well,
do
you
think
that,
just
in
general,
that
congress
probably
intended,
as
is
normally
the
case,
to
make
it
more
difficult
to
get...
to
be
entitled
to
punitive
damages
than
to
gain
compensatory
damages,
really?
unknown
speaker
well,
you
didn't
answer
my
question,
though.
unknown
speaker
which
is,
do
you
think
congress
intended
for
it
to
be
more
difficult
to
get
punitive
damages
than
to
get
compensatory
damages?
0....
i'm
sorry
to
hear
you
pause.
i...
i
thought
from
your
briefs
that
you
said
yes.
unknown
speaker
oh,
you
think
congress
may
have
made
a
mistake?
unknown
speaker
it
ended
up
that
way,
but
they
really
didn't--
unknown
speaker
--well,
mr.
schnapper--
unknown
speaker
--i
see.
mr.
schnapper,
help
me
on
one
thing.
in
order
to
be
found
liable
for
an
intentional
violation,
does
the...
does
the
defend...
does
it
have
to
be
shown
that
the
defendant
was
aware
of
title
vii,
or
is
it
sufficient
to
show
that
the
defendant
discriminated,
intentionally
discriminated,
said,
i
am
going
to
prefer
a
woman
because
she
is
a
woman?
unknown
speaker
all
right.
doesn't
the
punitive
damage
standard
require
knowledge
of
the
law?
it's
indifference
to
the
defendant's
rights.
and
i
presume
that
means
rights
under
the
statute.
unknown
speaker
okay.
so,
the...
so,
the...
the
reference
of
the
two
standards
are
different.
with
respect
to
the
intentionality
that
is
required
for
liability,
all
that
has
to
be
shown
was
that
there
was
an
intentional
discrimination,
period.
in
order
to
get
punitive
damages,
there
has
to
be
shown
that
there
was
either
knowledge
or
indifference
to
the...
the
likelihood
of
a
statutory
violation.
and...
and
because
you
have
to,
in
effect,
prove
this
reference
to
the
statute,
the
reference
to
the
legal
source
of
the
rights,
that
is
more
difficult,
and
that's
why
it
makes
sense
to
say
that
the
punitive
damage
standard
required
proof
of
something
more;
isn't
that
the
key
to
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
then,
if
you're
correct
in
that,
mr....
then
it...
it
bears
a
remarkable
resemblance
to
qualified
immunity.
unknown
speaker
and
you
would
charge...
you
would
charge
the
jury
to
find
whether
or
not
something
was
probably
illegal?
unknown
speaker
i
mean,
you
would
have
to,
wouldn't
you?
if
that's
the
test,
and
it's
for
the
jury
to
decide,
you
would
have
to
say,
you
of
the
jury,
would
you
find
this
was
probably
illegal?
unknown
speaker
but--
--is
the
statute
not--
--no,
but
you'd
have
to
charge
the
jury
as
to
what
the
defendant
knew,
whether
he
thought
it
was
probably
illegal--
unknown
speaker
--yes.
what--
unknown
speaker
--the
jury...
the
jury--
--what
about
the
malice
standard?
there...
there
are
two
tests.
one
is...
one
is
reckless
indifference;
the
other
one
is
malice.
does
malice
mean
certain
knowledge
that
it's
illegal?
unknown
speaker
you
mean
usually...
i
mean,
my
goodness...
you
mean
usually
there's...
there's
no
intent
to
injure
when
you...
when
you
discriminate
on
this
basis?
i
would
think
that
exists
in
most
of
the
cases,
doesn't
it?
unknown
speaker
mr.
schnapper,
you
gave
one
such
example.
you
said
that
the...
the
compensatory
damages...
now,
the
jury
doesn't
have
to
find
probably,
they
have
to
find
there
is
a
violation.
then,
for
punitive,
awareness
of
the
legal
standard.
and
you
gave
as
an
example
of
intentional
discrimination...
treat
a
man
differently
than
a
woman,
the
bfoq
defense.
are
there
other
instances
in
which
there
would
be
intentional
discrimination;
therefore,
compensatory
damages
would
be
a
must,
not
a
"may",
and
yet,
not
reckless
indifference
to
the
plaintiff's
federally
protected
right...
that's
the
statutory
phrase?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
take
it
what
congress
was
trying
to
do
was
to
tell
us
that
there
are
degrees
of
culpability
insofar
as
the
defendants
are
concerned.
is
it
relevant
to
say
that
a
corporation
or
an
association,
such
as
you
have
here,
a
corporate
employer,
has
a...
has
an
admirable
employment
policy
and
makes...
has
very,
very
clear
guidelines,
you
have
one
employer
in
a
management
position
who
departs,
is
it
relevant
to
tell
the
jury
that
the
employer
might
not
be
chargeable
with
those
punitive
damages
if
the
jury
finds
certain
criteria?
unknown
speaker
how
does
the...
how
does
the
jury...
how
is
the
jury
instructed?
unknown
speaker
mr.
schnapper,
what
about...
what
about
attribution?
normally,
in...
in
tort
law,
a...
a
higher...
what
should
i
say...
a
higher
agency
principle
is
applied
for
punitive
damages
than
for
compensatory
damages.
so
that
if...
i
mean,
an
agent
of
the
company
can
render
the
company
liable
for
compensatory
damages,
but
not
for...
not
for
punitive.
is
that
the...
is
that
also
true
here?
unknown
speaker
well...
well--
--he's
a
proxy
for
the
company--
--well,
it...
it's
relevant
to
the
extent
that...
whose...
whose
mental
condition
you
have
to
look
to...
wheat,
who
is
a
lower
one,
or...
who
was
the
higher
one,
i
forgot
his
name?
unknown
speaker
allen.
yeah,
allen
was
the
highest,
and
he
was
the
one
that...
that
did
the...
the
non-promotion.
and
if
we
look
only
to
allen,
we...
you
would
instruct
the
jury
differently
as
to
whose
mental...
whose
mental
state
was
relevant.
unknown
speaker
was...
wheat
was
the
head
of
the
washington
office?
unknown
speaker
and
allen
was
the
executive
director
of
the
whole
operation?
unknown
speaker
well,
how
do
i
know
that
that
was
the
reason?
unknown
speaker
i
mean,
all
i
see
is
the
text
of
the
statute.
and
from
the
text
of
the
statute,
it
says
punitive
damages.
i
would
apply
normal
punitive
damages
agency
principles.
and...
and
to
tie
into
justice
kennedy's
question,
i
would
think
that
a
company
who
has
a
policy
against
this...
this
kind
of
activity,
and
if
one
of
its
lower
employees,
even...
even
an
officer
such
as
wheat...
violates
that
policy,
i
would
think,
under
normal
agency
principles,
you
would
not
punish
the
company.
if
you
wanted
to
sue...
if
you
wanted
to
sue
wheat
individually,
that's
a
different
question.
but,
normally,
the...
the
company
has
to
be
a
bad
actor.
and
here,
the
company
has
this
policy,
and
it's...
it's
wheat
who
violated
it.
unknown
speaker
mr.
schnapper,
may
i
just
interject
this
thought?
although
references
to
legislative
history
won't
persuade
justice
scalia,
some
of
the
rest
of
us
are
interested
in
what
you
might
say
about
it.
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
it's
not
in
your
appendix
a.
it's...
it's
in
the
prologue
of
the...
of
the
statute?
i
mean,
i
don't
see
it
in
any
of
the...
in
your
statutory
appendix.
unknown
speaker
i'll
be
happy
to
look
at
the
public
law.
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask...
now,
the
position
of
the
en
banc
dissenters
here
supported
the
notion
that
it
must
be
the
company
or
the
dental
association
itself
that
acted
recklessly
or
with
malice
here,
was
it
not?
i
mean,
that
was
the
position
taken,
as
i
read
it,
by
the
en
banc
dissenters.
unknown
speaker
thank
you,
mr.
schnapper.
general
waxman,
we'll
hear
from
you.
unknown
speaker
well,
mr....
general
waxman,
that's
quite
true.
but,
obviously,
looking
at
the
divided
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals,
there
are
several
different
possible...
possible
ways
of
interpreting
that.
and
why
isn't
one
possible
canon
of
construction
that
punitive
damages
are
not
favorites
of
the
law?
this
court
has
held
a
couple
of
times
that
there
are
constitutional
limitations
on
them.
so,
when
there
is
reasonable
doubt
as
to
whether
they're
available
or
not,
the...
the
court's
answer
should
be
they're
not
available.
unknown
speaker
should
it
be
the
consciousness
of
the
company
itself
or,
in
this
case,
the
association,
or
some
lesser
employee?
unknown
speaker
well,
i'm
asking
you
for
a
principle.
unknown
speaker
because
i
want
to
keep
that
in
mind
as
we
decide
this
case.
and
what
is
your
position
on
that?
unknown
speaker
but
if
the
eeoc
considers
something
like
that,
i
mean,
it's
not
on
the
basis
of
running
jury
trials,
is
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
why...
why
does
the
eeoc
have
any
business
laying
down
jury
instructions?
unknown
speaker
so,
you're
talking
about
not
the
eeoc
as
an
administrative
body,
but
when
it
goes
to
court?
unknown
speaker
well,
have
you
answered
my
question
yet?
unknown
speaker
because
i'm
not
sure
you
have.
you're
winding
up,
though.
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
by
that,
you
mean
not
hiring?
unknown
speaker
well,
that's
90
percent
of
the
cases,
but
go
ahead.
unknown
speaker
is
that
the
same
as
the
traditional
agency
principles
for
when
you
subject
a
company
to
punitive
damages
liability?
unknown
speaker
or
is
some
variation
of
that?
unknown
speaker
general
waxman,
could--
unknown
speaker
--can
i
ask
you,
before
you
sit
down,
what
charge
would
you
request
or
what
charge
would
you
say
fits
with
your
interpretation
of
the
law?
how
should
a
jury
in
this
case,
for
example,
be
charged
on
the
issue
of
punitive
damages?
unknown
speaker
suppose
you
have
a
case
in
which
the
employer
tells
the
female
employee,
you're...
you're
carrying
a
child,
you're
going
to
be
a
mother
soon,
we
think
this
position
is...
is
just
going
to
put
too
much
stress
on
you,
because
women
have
special
bonds
with
the
child.
a
violation
of
the
law,
in...
insensitive,
and
yet
a
person
who
acts
in
good
faith.
can
the
jury
consider
that--
unknown
speaker
--and
say,
well,
this
man
was
wrong
under
the
law,
but
he
acted
in,
really,
her
best
interest,
he
wasn't
malice...
malicious
in
the
usual
sense
of
that
term;
could
the
jury--
unknown
speaker
--consider
that
among
themselves
in
their
own
deliberations?
unknown
speaker
okay.
then
can...
can
you
instruct
the
jury
that
they
could
consider
that?
unknown
speaker
yeah,
if
you
could
complete
the...
you
didn't
get
to
finish
what
your
instruction
would
be.
so--
unknown
speaker
--thank
you,
general
waxman.
we'll
hear
from
you,
mr.
fay.
unknown
speaker
may...
may
i
just...
i'm
just
not
quite
sure
i
followed
your
argument.
the...
the
common
law
term
that
we
are
comparing
this
to
is
"punitive
damages",
or
is
it
the
common
law
meaning
of
the
words
"reckless
indifference"
and
"malice"?
unknown
speaker
so,
your
answer
would
be
different,
and...
and
you
would...
would
you
concede
that
plaintiff
is
correct,
if
instead
of
saying
"punitive
damages"
it
had
been
called
"liquidated
damages"?
and
the
same
thing,
a
jury
may
award
liquidated
damages
if
it
finds
the
defendant
acted
with
reckless
indifference
to
the
federally
protected
rights
of
the
aggrieved
individual?
unknown
speaker
well,
i'm...
i'm
proposing
liquidated
damages
without
embell...
embellishment,
or,
say,
if
it
had
said
statutory
damages.
unknown
speaker
how
about
civil
penalties?
unknown
speaker
mr.
fay...
mr
fay,
i'm...
you
said
the...
the
language,
it's
reckless
indifference
to
the
federally
protected
rights.
the
reckless
indifference
has
a
definite
frame
of
reference
in
the
statute.
unknown
speaker
no,
but
malice...
malice
is
conduct?
unknown
speaker
well,
the
reference
is
to
the
statute...
to
the...
to
the
rights.
the
statute
uses
the
word
"rights".
unknown
speaker
and
the
mental
state
looks
to
rights,
not
to
the
conduct
or
consciousness
of
the
conduct,
or
even
consciousness
of
the
tangible
consequences
of
the
conduct.
unknown
speaker
well,
at
the
very
least,
then,
you
agree
that
it
does
look
to
consciousness
or...
or
indifference
to
the
existence
of
the
sources
of
the
legal
rights?
unknown
speaker
okay.
unknown
speaker
why
isn't
it
up
to
the
jury?
i
mean,
it's
not
as
though
the
seriousness
of
it
will...
will...
will
not
come
into
the
case.
what
we're
talking
about
here
is
what...
what
this
language
permits
the
factfinder
to
determine.
and
it'll
usually
be
a
jury,
i
assume.
what...
what
is
the
problem
about
letting
the
jury
take
into
account
the
egregiousness
issue?
i
suppose
they
may.
unknown
speaker
well,
what--
--i
take
it--
--isn't
that
what
the
statute
says?
i
mean,
that...
that's
the...
the
way
i've
read
the
statute...
and
i'd
like
you
to...
it's
the
same
as
what
justice
souter
has
been
asking,
and
i
think
justice
stevens.
unknown
speaker
what
it
says
specifically
is
the
first
question
in
these
cases
is,
was
there
intentional
discrimination,
say,
on
the
ground
of
gender?
and,
normally,
they're
defended
on
the
ground
that
it
was
a
pretext,
that
it
wasn't
a
pretext.
i
fired
her
because
she
was
always
late.
no,
that's
a
pretext.
you
fired
her
because
she
was
a
woman.
so,
you
have
to
establish
the
facts.
once
the
facts
are
established,
and
if
the
plain...
the
plaintiff
wins
on
the
facts,
that
means
that
the
person
has
intentionally
discriminated
on
the
ground
of
gender.
so,
then,
there'd
be
a
second
question:
did
that
defendant
know
that
intentional
discrimination
against
a
woman
is
illegal?
and
if
the
answer
to
that
question
is
yes,
he
did
know
it's
illegal,
that's
the
end
of
this
case;
you
can
assess
punitives.
now,
there's
a
third
very
rare
situation,
where
the
answer
to
the
second
question
is
no,
he
didn't
know;
he
thought
it
was
legal.
i
don't
know
that
there's
a
human
being
in
the
united
states
who
thinks
it's
legal,
intentionally,
to
discriminate
against
women
or
on
grounds
of
race.
but
if
we
find
that
human
being,
the
next
question
would
be...
the
next
question
would
be:
should
he
have
known...
not
just
should
he
have
known,
but
should
he
really,
really
have
known?
that's
reckless
disregard.
okay.
now,
it
seems
to
me
that's
what
the
statute
says.
and
even
though
it
means
punitives
now
could
be
assessed
pretty
regularly
with
intentional
discrimination,
it
might
have
meant
there'd
be
far
fewer
cases
at
the
time
this
was
enacted,
when
people
didn't
know
what
the
law
is.
but
that's
what
it
seems
to
say.
and
if
that's
what
it
seems
to
say,
what's
the
answer...
what's
the
argument
that
we
should
do
something
other
than
what
it
says?
unknown
speaker
mr.
fay,
do
i
understand
that
you
are
riding...
putting
your
heaviest
weight
on
the
label
"punitive
damages"?
that
is,
you
answered
me
that
if
the
statute
had
said
liquidated
damages
or
statutory
damages,
then
you
would
have
no
problem
with
justice
breyer,
what
he
said
is
the
proper;
is
that
right?
unknown
speaker
oh,
so,
then,
the
label
doesn't
matter,
and
you'd
say
the
same
thing,
even
if
it
said
"liquidated
damages"
or
"statutory
damages"
and
not
"punitive
damages"?
so,
it's
not--
unknown
speaker
--so,
suppose
the
label
were
"liquidated
damages".
then,
is
justice
breyer's
description
of
how
the
case
would
unfold
correct?
unknown
speaker
well,
you're
saying,
i
guess,
then,
that
there's
got
to
be
deliberate
indifference
with
respect
to
the...
to
the...
to
the
right,
as
such,
but
there's
got
to
be
some
egregiousness
in
addition
to
that.
does
that...
are
you
saying
there's
got
to
be
an
egregious
deliberate
indifference?
unknown
speaker
well,
if
that's
the
case,
then
why
doesn't
deliberate...
egregious,
deliberate
indifference
just
collapse
into
malice?
because
malice,
i
suppose,
under
this
statute,
the...
the
paradigm
example
of
malice...
would
in
fact
be
consciousness
of
the
legal
prohibition
and
intentional
discrimination
in
the
face
of
that
consciousness.
unknown
speaker
and
i...
i
don't
know
quite
how
i
would
draw
a
line
between
malice,
in
that
sense
of
consciousness,
and
some
kind
of
egregious
degree
of...
of
indifference.
unknown
speaker
i
don't
know
how...
i
don't
know
how
a
jury
would
ever
tell
them
apart.
unknown
speaker
no,
but
you've
just
given...
i
don't
want
to
put
words
in
your
mouth
if
you
don't
want
to
take
them...
but
i
thought
you
had...
had
agreed
with
me
that
malice
here
probably
means
a...
an
actual
knowledge
of
the
legal
prohibition.
unknown
speaker
you...
you
don't
agree
with
me
on
that?
unknown
speaker
malice
is
an
intent
to
be...
to
be
nasty,
to
hurt.
unknown
speaker
you--
--gee,
an
actual
intent
to
be
nasty
or
to
hurt
may...
may
well
disprove
the...
the
sexual
discrimination
charge.
i
mean,
it
would
usually
be
the
defendant's
defense.
he'd
come
in
and
say,
no,
i
didn't
discriminate
against
this
person
because
she...
she
was
a
woman.
i
just
didn't
like
her.
i
really
hated
her.
and
i--
unknown
speaker
--how
could
that
be
malice?
unknown
speaker
so,
i
think
malice
may
well
mean...
malice
may
well
mean
actual
knowledge
that
it's
against
the
law,
and
nothing
but
that.
unknown
speaker
because
you
have
to
read
it:
malice
or
deliberate
indifference.
deliberate
indifference
is
always
a
lesser
state
of
whatever
malice
is.
unknown
speaker
exactly.
but
you
don't
have
to
know
that
it's
unlawful
to
be
in
violation
of
the
statute.
unknown
speaker
so,
actual
knowledge
of
unlawfulness
is
malice;
you
agree
with
that?
unknown
speaker
again,
my
problem
isn't
even
an
intention
to
injure.
the
individual
negates,
it
seems
to
me,
the...
the
sex
discrimination
charge.
unknown
speaker
well,
but
isn't
discriminating
against
someone
because
of
sex...
isn't
that
an
intent...
intent
to
injure
them?
you're
denying
them,
say,
a
job
promotion.
and
you're
denying
them
because
of...
because
of
their
sex.
unknown
speaker
but
how...
you
say
the
conduct
is
serious
enough.
but
what
more
do
we
need?
unknown
speaker
you
don't
suggest,
mr.
fay,
that
every
time
there's
an
intent
to
discriminate,
there's
also
the
intent
to
harm
the
individual?
supposing
the
police
force
decides
they
think,
in
a
particular
neighborhood,
they'd
like
to
promote
an
african
american
officer,
so
white
officers
didn't
get
the
job.
there's
no
intent
to
harm
the
white
person,
they
just
made
perhaps
an
impermissible
decision.
unknown
speaker
sure.
unknown
speaker
why?
why
not?
why
not,
the
pretext
was
a
pretext?
unknown
speaker
the
pretext
was
a
pretext.
there's
a
finding
that
the...
the
person--
unknown
speaker
--on
the
facts,
discriminated
intentionally.
unknown
speaker
if...
if
in
fact
the
employer
thinks
that
if
i'm
doing
this
intentionally,
i
don't
know
if
it's
illegal,
i
agree
that
then
you
would
have,
on
i
think
what
i'm
taking
is
the
opposite
theory
from
yours,
as
i
said,
that
if
the
employer
believes
that
intentional
discrimination
is
not
unlawful,
then
punitives
would
not
be
assessable
unless
he
should
have
known
that
it
was
unlawful.
i
agree
with
that.
so,
maybe
we
don't
agree.
can
i
ask
you
one
other
question?
which
is,
why...
why,
if
the
statute
is...
i
think
is...
why
should
we
fight
so
hard
to
resist
eligibility
for
punitives
in
a
statute
that
has
two
other
checks?
one
is
the
check
that
the
jury
might
not
assess
the
punitive,
but,
more
importantly,
is
the
unusual
check
that
the
punitives
are
rather
limited
in
amount?
i
think
it's
like
300,000
dollars,
or
30,000
dollars,
or
50,000
dollars,
depending
on
the
firm.
am
i
right
about
that?
unknown
speaker
and
so...
so,
given
the
cap
that's
in
the
statute,
why
do
we
think
that
congress
would
not
have
wanted
them
widely
assessable?
unknown
speaker
i...
i
just
want
to
make
it
clear
what
you're...
do...
do
you
agree
that
every
time
the
employer
knows,
or
should
have
known,
that
his
official...
or
its
official
actions
is
a
violation
of
the
law
and
the
employer
then
proceeds
to
take
that
action
in
any
event,
that
there
is
malice
or
reckless
disregard?
unknown
speaker
all
right.
what...
what
are
the
instances
in
which
there
is
no
malice
or
reckless
disregard?
unknown
speaker
was
that
true
in
this
case?
unknown
speaker
but
wasn't...
wasn't
the
woman,
in
her...
in
her
own
mind
and
in
her
own
psyche,
injured,
disturbed,
et
cetera,
et
cetera,
et
cetera?
unknown
speaker
if
she
had,
the
result
would
have
been
different?
unknown
speaker
if
she
said,
you
know,
i
really
knew
i
was
discriminated
against
for
being
a
woman...
woman,
and
it...
it
hurt
me
very,
very
badly,
it
upset
me,
et
cetera,
et
cetera?
unknown
speaker
so...
so,
you
capture
this
by
instructing
the
jury
in
terms
of
egregious
behavior?
unknown
speaker
well,
then...
then
we
capture
it
by
putting
the
law
of
this
court,
that
it
has
to
be
egregious
behavior?
unknown
speaker
and
that
all
comes
from
the
label
"punitive",
because
the
common
law
wasn't
that
way
for
liquidated
or
statutory?
unknown
speaker
why
did
it
say
malice
or
deliberate
indifference,
then,
if
it
wasn't...
if
it
wasn't
changing
what...
what
punitive
damages
were
at
the
common
law?
why
didn't
they
just
say
the
jury
may
award
punitive
damages,
period?
unknown
speaker
let
me
just
be
sure
about
one
thing.
your
view
is
that
this
statute
adopts
the
same
standard
that
the
majority
adopted
in
smith
against
wade?
unknown
speaker
did
smith
and...
did
smith
and
wade
refer
to
indifference
to
rights?
yes,
it
says
callous
indifference
to
the
federally
protected
rights
of
others.
it's
the
same
language.
unknown
speaker
yeah.
unknown
speaker
let
me
go
one
step
further
with
you,
to
be
sure
i...
there
was
a
very
sharp
debate
in
smith
against
wade
as
to
exactly
what
the
common
law
did
mean.
and
the
majority
took
one
view
and
the
dissenters
very
persuasively
argued
the
other
view.
[laughter]
but
your
view
is
that
the
majority
view
is
the
one
that
we
should
follow?
unknown
speaker
we
usually
do
that,
don't
we?
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
will
you
also
clarify
whether...
at
one
point
you
said
that
malice
is
a
synonym
for
reckless
indifference
to
the
federally
protected
rights
of
the
aggrieved
individual,
and
at
another
point
you
seem
to
suggest
that
those
two
terms
had
discrete
meanings.
so,
which
is
it?
does
malice
mean
something
different
than
reckless
indifference
to
the
federally
protected
rights?
unknown
speaker
so,
but
let's
take
these
words
written
into
this
statute.
it
says
"malice".
and
then
it
says
"or
reckless
indifference
to
the
federally
protected
rights.
"
what
you
read
suggests
that
there's
no
difference;
that
reckless
indifference,
when
it's
bad
enough,
becomes
malice.
but
the
statute
seems
to
have
two
discrete
categories.
one
is
malice.
the
other
reckless
indifference
to
federally
protected
rights.
unknown
speaker
well,
we've
already
established
that
there
are
some
cases,
like
good
faith
but
wrong
judgment,
about
the
exceptions
under
the
law,
the
bfoq,
when
you're
allowed
to
make
a
religious
preference.
unknown
speaker
well,
what
egregious...
i
mean,
what
do
you
mean
by...
by
an...
an
egregious
act?
this
act
only
covers
firing.
it
doesn't
involve
murder
or
torture
or
anything
else.
how
can
you...
how
can
you
have
a
really
egregious
firing?
[laughter]
unless...
unless
it's
the
motive.
unless
it's
the
motive,
which...
which
you
assert
is
not
the
point.
unknown
speaker
so,
if--
--but
you
just
said
it's
the
conduct,
it's
what
the
defendant
does,
not
the...
i
mean,
punitive
damage
is
not
going
to
turn
on
whether
the
plaintiff
is
thin-skinned,
is
it?
unknown
speaker
i
have
it:
firing
on
christmas
eve.
that
would
do
it,
wouldn't
it?
[laughter]
that
is
really--
unknown
speaker
--well,
why...
why
isn't
intentional...
intentional
discrimination...
you
have
to
assume
the
facts
show
it...
we
intentionally
dismissed
someone
from
her...
her
job
on
the
basis,
let's
say,
of
gender,
because
she's
a
woman,
or
of
race,
and
i...
the
employer
does
it
intentionally,
for
that
reason,
knowing
that
it's
unlawful
under
the
law
of
the
united
states;
why
isn't
that
egregious?
unknown
speaker
just
in
and
of
itself?
that,
intentional
discrimination
on
the
grounds
of
race,
knowing
that
that's
illegal,
no
bfoq
things,
et
cetera.
i
mean,
that's
it.
is
that,
in
your
opinion,
egregious
and
goes
to
the
jury?
unknown
speaker
well--
--but
you
still...
to
say
it
goes
to
the
jury,
you
still
have
to
resolve
the
question
of
whether
the
intent
of
the
particular
supervisor
is
going
to
be
attributed
to
the
corporation,
don't
you?
unknown
speaker
and
it's
not
before...
before
the
court
why?
unknown
speaker
the
question
presented
is,
in
what
circumstances
may
punitive
damages
be
awarded
under
title
vii
of
the
1964
civil
rights
act?
if
that
isn't
included
in
the...
in
the
question
presented,
i
don't
know
what
is.
unknown
speaker
in
your
answer
to
justice
breyer's
question--
unknown
speaker
--you
said
there's
an
intentional
violation;
why
isn't
that
the
end
of
the
case?
unknown
speaker
you
said
"it
may
very
well
be".
but
i
need
to
know
your
description
of
those
class...
classifications
of
the
cases
where
it
is
not
so.
i
know
it
may
very
well
be--
unknown
speaker
--but
i...
i
want
to
know
when
it
isn't.
unknown
speaker
where
are
you
reading
from?
unknown
speaker
well,
i'm
glad
we
don't
carry
over
the
government's
resentment
of
federal
civil
rights
law
into
the
income
tax.
[laughter]
may
i
go
back
to
your
answer
to
justice
breyer's
question
for
a
different
purpose?
you
said
that
if...
if
there
is
in
fact
awareness
of
the...
of
the
federal
civil
rights
act
and
a...
and
an
intentional
discrimination
in
disregard
of...
of
what
one
knows
is
a
legal
duty,
that...
that
may
very
well
be
malice,
and
at
least
it
would
go
to
the
jury.
unknown
speaker
you...
you've
also
said
that
the...
that
the
indifference
standard
in
the
statute
is...
is
virtually
identical,
or
tantamount,
to
that
kind
of
malice.
so,
i
suppose,
in
any
case
in
which
the...
the
indifference
is
shown,
that
would
at
least
get
to
the
jury,
too;
is
that
right?
unknown
speaker
well,
the...
justice
breyer's
question
focused
only
on
the
mental
state.
unknown
speaker
and...
and
you
said,
yes,
that
would
be
enough
to
get
to
the
jury.
unknown
speaker
that's
right.
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
well,
i...
i
just...
i
just
want
to...
to
go
further
in
terms
of
your
answer
to
his
question.
and
i...
and
i
guess
my...
my
question
is,
if...
if
malice...
i'm
sorry...
if
knowledge...
if
discrimination
with
knowledge
of
the
act
goes
to
the
jury,
and
the
indifference
is,
i
guess,
virtually
tantamount
to
that,
why
doesn't
every
indifference
case
also
go
to
the
jury
without
anything
more?
unknown
speaker
thank
you,
mr.
fay.
mr.
schnapper,
you
have
four
minutes
remaining.
unknown
speaker
but
in...
in
the
faragher
case
last
year,
we
certainly
imported
standards
from
the
restatement
that
weren't
in
the
statute.
unknown
speaker
well,
we
weren't
dealing
with
the
same
statute,
but
i...
i
don't
see
why
that
bears
on
the
desirability
or
vel
non.
unknown
speaker
i
mean,
this...
this
statute
is
simply
confusing
to...
no...
no
one
can
pretend
that
it's
a
clear
guideline
as
to
where...
where
a
court
is
to
go.
unknown
speaker
well,
look...
look
at
the
way
the
court
of
appeals
split
on
it.
it
suggests
that
reasonable
people
can
surely
differ
as
to
what
it
means.
unknown
speaker
well,
but
i
mean,
the
argument
made
by...
by
your
opponent
is
not
an
unreasonable
one.
it...
it
comes
down
to
whether
punitive
damages
is
a
term
of
art.
and
the...
the
later
limit...
the...
the
later
specification
of
malice
and
reckless
indifference
is
a
limitation
upon
normal
punitive
damages.
punitive
damages
may
be
awarded.
that
is,
damages
for
egregious
conduct.
but
only
if
there
is
malice
or...
now,
that's
one
way
to
read
it.
and
the
other
way
to
read
it
is...
is
not
as
a
term
of
art,
and
just
to
say,
punitive
damages...
that
is,
damages
that
punish
the
defendant...
may
be
awarded
whenever
there
is
malice
or
reckless
indifference.
it
seems
to
me
both
readings
are
plausible
ones.
unknown
speaker
the
question
is
whether
they
are
limitations
upon
normal
punitive
damages
or
whether
they
are
a
re-description
of
what
punitive
damages
consist
of.
and
they
could
be
either.
unknown
speaker
well,
there
was
one
brief,
at
least,
that
said,
inherent
in
the
very
word
"punitive
damages"
is
this
egregiousness
notion.
so,
by
using
the
word
"punitive",
congress
meant
egregious.
unknown
speaker
when
the
court
summarized
its
holding
in
smith
against
wade,
did
it
use
the
word
"egregious"?
unknown
speaker
suppose...
suppose
it
said
compensatory
damages
may
be
awarded
if
there
is
malice
or...
or
reckless
indifference.
now,
in
reading
that,
wouldn't
you
say
that
the
damages
that
can
be
awarded
can
be
no
more
than
the
loss
which
the
plaintiff
incurred?
because
the
congress
used
the
word
"compensatory
damages".
wouldn't
you
read
it
that
way?
unknown
speaker
okay.
