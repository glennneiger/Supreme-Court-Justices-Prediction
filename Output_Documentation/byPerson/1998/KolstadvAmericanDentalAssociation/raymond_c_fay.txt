mr.
raymond
c.
fay
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
fundamental
difference
in
perspective
between
the
two
sides
in
this
case
is
that
the
petitioner's
focus,
exclusive
focus,
on
the
term
"reckless
indifference"
ignores
the
fundamental
starting
point:
that
this
is
a
statute
about
punitive
damages.
and
when
congress
uses
the
term
"punitive
damages"
or
other
terms
derived
from
common
law
in
a
statute,
those
terms,
absent
a
contrary
indication
by
congress,
have
the
same
meaning
as
they
do
at
the
common
law.
and
at
common
law,
there
were
three
hallmarks
of
punitive
damages.
first,
the
focus
is
on
the
nature
of
the
conduct,
not
purely
the
mental
state,
as
the
petitioner
says.
secondly,
the
conduct
is
outrageous
or
egregious.
and,
thirdly,
the
purpose
is
to
punish
or...
or
to
deter.
it's
egregious
conduct.
mr.
raymond
c.
fay
it's
both,
justice
stevens.
because
this
is
a
statute
that
says
punitive
damages
may
be
awarded
under
a
particular
standard.
and
my
point
is
that
if
we
focus
solely
on
the
word
"reckless"
or
"indifference",
or
the
two
together,
we're
losing
sight
of
the
fact
that
congress
was
imposing
punitive
damages
for
a
particular
action
here,
and
that...
and
there
is
no
indication
the
congress
was
meaning
anything
other
than
the
traditional
meaning
of
punitive
damages--
mr.
raymond
c.
fay
--that
may...
very
well
may
be
a...
a
different
signal,
your
honor.
because,
for
example,
in
the
cases
that
were
brought
up
before,
the
adea
cases,
the
reference
there,
liquidated
damages
for
a
willful
violation,
was
to
a
statute...
that
is,
the
fair
labor
standards
act...
whereas
the
reference
here
is
to
punitive
damages
without
embellishment,
meaning
we
look
to
the
common
law.
mr.
raymond
c.
fay
and...
and
my
answer
is
that
i
agree
that
that
may
very
well
have
a
different
meaning.
because
punitive
damages
has
a
common
law
root,
whereas
liquidated
damages
does
not.
mr.
raymond
c.
fay
civil
penalties
come
in
different...
different
shapes.
there
is
a
rich
body
of
law
about
what
types
of
civil
penalties
there
may
be.
just
using
the
term
"civil
pen...
penalties",
i
think--
mr.
raymond
c.
fay
--it
certainly
does.
and
that
reference,
first
of
all,
is
in
the
common
law.
and
this
court,
on
many
occasions...
a
case
in
point
in
molzof
v.
united
states...
states...
and
smith
v.
wade,
which
is
cited
in
the
legislative
history
here,
and
from
which
the
words
were
borrowed
to
put...
to
put
those
words
in
this
statute.
reckless
indifference
is
the
equivalent
of
malice.
it
is
the
equivalence
in
the
sense
that,
again,
we
look
to
the
conduct.
because
reckless
indifference
to
federally
protected
rights
means
acting,
or
failing
to
act,
in
putting
a
person
at
substantial
risk
of
serious
harm.
it's
the
consequences
and
the
conduct
that
are
focused--
mr.
raymond
c.
fay
--well,
when...
again,
the
statute
is
framed
this
way.
it
says:
the
discriminatory
practices
are
committed
with
malice
or
reckless
indifference.
the
reference
is
always
back
to
the
discriminatory
practice
or
the
conduct.
mr.
raymond
c.
fay
it
also
tells
us,
justice
souter,
that
it
is
the...
it
is
the
discriminatory
practice
that
is
done
with
respect
to
those
rights.
so,
we
look
to
both
the
mental
state
and
the
conduct.
mr.
raymond
c.
fay
it
does
both,
your
honor.
and
what...
what
our
point
is--
mr.
raymond
c.
fay
--that's
correct.
mr.
raymond
c.
fay
and
what
i'm
saying
is
you
can't
divorce
that
from
the
conduct
that's
at
issue.
otherwise
what
happens
is
you
look
at
the
mental
state
without
regard
to
whether
the
underlying
discriminatory
conduct
was
serious
enough
to
impose
punitive
damages,
or
even
whether
the
underlying
discriminatory
conduct
was
a
violation
at
all.
mr.
raymond
c.
fay
they
certainly
would
take
it
into
account.
but
the...
but
the
test
that's
advocated
by
the
petitioner
would
be
to
usurp
the
traditional
role
of
the
court
in
determining
whether
there
is
evidence
of
this
higher
standard
of
culpability
in
the
statute
to
impose
punitive
damages.
the
petitioner
would
say
virtually
all
cases
of
intentional
discrimination
go
to
the
jury.
mr.
raymond
c.
fay
it
is.
mr.
raymond
c.
fay
i...
i
think
that
your
second
question,
justice
breyer,
does
not
take
into
account
what
types
of
damages
these
are.
these
are
punitive
damages.
these
are
not
damages
that
are
assessed
simply
on
a
separate
inquiry
about
what
someone
thinks.
they
are...
they
are
based
on
a
common
law
tradition
of
a
more
difficult
standard
of
proof,
and
they
are
also
based
on
the
tying
together
of
the
discriminatory
practice
with
the
required
mental
state.
mr.
raymond
c.
fay
the
second
part
of
my
answer
to
the...
to
your
previous
question,
your
honor,
was
that
at
common
law,
reckless
indifference
was,
as
stated
in
footnote
10
of
the
smith
v.
wade
opinion,
the
equivalent
of
malice.
mr.
raymond
c.
fay
no.
i...
i
stand
by
my
previous
answer,
that
that
tells
us
what
the
statutory
reference
point
is.
it
is
not
liquidated
damages,
as
in
the
adea,
where
the
sole
reference
point--
mr.
raymond
c.
fay
--it
would
be
very
much
closer
to
justice
breyer's
description.
mr.
raymond
c.
fay
i'm
saying
that
it...
it
has
to
be,
as
part
of
it,
in
this
statutory
framework.
mr.
raymond
c.
fay
that's
correct.
mr.
raymond
c.
fay
well--
mr.
raymond
c.
fay
--the...
in
terms
of
the
classical
definitions
of
malice,
which
is
actual
evil
motive
or
intent
to
injure,
and--
mr.
raymond
c.
fay
--oh,
it
may--
mr.
raymond
c.
fay
--malice
may
have
a
actual
intent
which
is
irrespective
of
the
knowledge
of
the
requirements
of
the
law.
mr.
raymond
c.
fay
yes.
exactly.
mr.
raymond
c.
fay
and
that's--
mr.
raymond
c.
fay
--and
that's
precisely
why,
justice
scalia--
mr.
raymond
c.
fay
--well--
mr.
raymond
c.
fay
--that's
true.
but
the...
but
the
reference
point
in
the
statute
is
to
the
discriminatory
practice.
so,
if
it's
not
a
discriminatory
practice
that's
committed
with
malice...
that
is,
to
discriminate
because
the
applicant
was
a
woman,
instead
of
personal
animus...
then
it
wouldn't
be
discriminatory
to
begin
with.
you
have
to
tie
the
two
together
by
the
structure
of
the
statute.
mr.
raymond
c.
fay
i
agree...
i
agree
with
that.
mr.
raymond
c.
fay
i...
i
don't
think
you
need
actual
knowledge
of
unlawfulness
to
get
to
malice.
i
think
you
need
to
commit
the...
the
intentional
act,
which
may
or
may
not
relate
to
a
consciousness
of
what
the
statute
requires,
with
an
evil
motive
or
intent
to
injure
that
individual.
and
whether
you
even
knew
anything
about
the
requirements
of
the
act,
i
don't
think
bears
on
that
aspect
of
it.
mr.
raymond
c.
fay
if
it's
unrelated
to
the
sex
discrimination.
mr.
raymond
c.
fay
and
that
is...
that
is
injurious.
and
in
a
case
in
which
the
conduct
is
serious
enough,
then
it
should
go
to
the
jury
on
the
question
of
punitive
damages.
mr.
raymond
c.
fay
the...
the
classic
example
of...
of
the
difference
between
the
two...
and
congress'
intending
to
have
only
the
more
serious
cases
go
to
the
jury...
is
that
this
court,
in
mcdonnell
douglas
v.
green,
and
follow-up
cases,
has
established
a
paradigm
of
proof
for
intentional
discrimination
in
which
there
may
be
very
little
known
about
what
the
employer
thinks;
that
pretext
alone
may
suffice,
by
judicial
presumptions
and
inferences,
to
get
to
the
jury
on
the
question
of
intentional
discrimination.
mr.
raymond
c.
fay
and
that
would
also
be...
be
true
in
the
pretext
cases.
mr.
raymond
c.
fay
it...
it
is
classified
as
intentional
discrimination,
but
it
certainly
does
not
carry
with
it
any
reckless
indifference
to
their
rights
or
malicious
intent.
mr.
raymond
c.
fay
well--
mr.
raymond
c.
fay
--because
a
person
could
be--
mr.
raymond
c.
fay
--well,
for
example,
an
employer
may
be
misguided
in
thinking
that
they
need
to
foster
affirmative
action,
when
affirmative
action
might
result--
mr.
raymond
c.
fay
--that's
correct.
the
total
cap
is
300,000
dollars
for
the
largest
employers.
mr.
raymond
c.
fay
one
answer
i
think
is
that
there
were,
as
this
court
is
aware,
many,
many
compromises
in
reaching
this...
this
act
the
second
time
around.
and
the
caps
and
the
punitive
damages
and
the
pun...
and
the
compensatory
damages,
at
times,
ran
on
different
tracks.
so,
in
a
sense,
the
question
of...
of
what
is
the
standard
for
punitive
damages
was
decided
apart
from
the
very
political
compromise
as
to
the
caps.
and
the...
the
stigma
and
the
seriousness
of
punitive
damages,
i
would
submit,
should
be
decided
apart
from
what
the
caps
are,
which
might
be
amended
tomorrow.
mr.
raymond
c.
fay
no.
mr.
raymond
c.
fay
if...
the
instances
are
in
which
there
is
no
risk
of
serious
physical,
psychological
or,
in
the
rare
instance,
economic,
harm
to
the
individual.
and
that
analysis
has
to
be
done,
in
our
view,
in
the
first
instance,
by
the
district
judge.
mr.
raymond
c.
fay
it
was
certainly
true
in
this
case.
the
judge
decided
that
there
was
no
evidence
to
satisfy
the
statute
standard.
and
the
district
court's
comments
were...
were
based
on
the
fact
that
the
majority...
almost
all
of
the
evidence
in
this
case
was
based
on
pre-selection
and
pretext.
mr.
raymond
c.
fay
no.
she
did
not
claim
any
type
of
compensatory
damages
for
pain
and
suffering
or
emotional
distress
and
the
like.
mr.
raymond
c.
fay
if
she--
mr.
raymond
c.
fay
--if
there
had
been
inter...
first
of
all,
that
would
have
qualified
for...
for
compensatory
damages
under
the
statute.
and
that's
one
of
the
big
changes
that
was
made
in
this
law.
secondly,
if
the
evidence
had
shown
that
there
was
interaction,
to
show
that
the...
the
employer
was
punishing
her
or
treating
her
poorly
because
she
was
having
that
reaction,
that
would
be
the
type
of
case
that
would
go
to
the
jury;
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
raymond
c.
fay
i
don't
think
you
need
to
capture
it
by
instructing
the
jury
of
that,
because
it's
up
to
the
judge
to
make
the
threshold
determination.
and
then
it
would
go
to
the
jury
on
instructions
which
may--
mr.
raymond
c.
fay
--because
that's
what's
required
at
the
common
law.
mr.
raymond
c.
fay
it's
more
than
from
the
label
"punitive",
your
honor.
because,
for
example,
if
congress
wanted
to
modify
the
meaning
of
punitive
damages,
it
could
have
done
that,
as,
for
example,
it
did
with
compensatory
damages.
it
said
you
get
compensatory
damages
here,
but
then
it
says
certain
things
don't
count
as--
mr.
raymond
c.
fay
--because
it
was
using
as
its
reference
point
the
case...
this
court's
decision
in
smith
v.
wade,
in
which
malice
and
reckless
indifference
were
defined
as
standards
for
punitive
damages
under
the
common
law.
and
it...
it,
almost
word
for
word,
carried
those
words
from
the
opinion
into
the
statute.
but
this
court's
decision
in
smith
v.
wade
emphasizes
that
outrageous
conduct
is
required
to
meet
those
standards
of
malice
or
reckless
indifference.
and...
and
the
difference
between
our
view
and
the
petitioner's
is
you
don't
focus
simply
on
the
state
of
mind;
you
have
to
focus
on
the
discriminatory
conduct.
and
it
has
to
be
serious
enough
to
impose--
mr.
raymond
c.
fay
--i...
yes,
i
think
that
its
common
law
roots
are
the
same,
your
honor.
mr.
raymond
c.
fay
that...
those
were
the
very
words--
mr.
raymond
c.
fay
--from
smith
v.
wade
that
were
incorporated
here.
the...
the
main
difference,
of
course,
is
that
this
was
a
decision
of
this
court
explicating
the
common
law,
whereas
congress
then
embodied
that
into
a
statute.
and
the
first
question
is:
when
congress
used
those
words
in
the
statute,
did
it
mean
to
alter
the
common
law?
there's
a
suggestion
in
the
government's
brief,
and
a
footnote,
that
it
did.
there's
nothing
in
the
legislative
history
that
shows
that
congress
intended
to
alter
the
common
law
in
incorporating
these
words.
there's
no
reference
as
there
was,
for
example,
that
we
were
trying
to
mimic--
mr.
raymond
c.
fay
--that's...
that's
the
rule
which
explicates
the
common
law
and
was
carried
forward
in
this
statute.
mr.
raymond
c.
fay
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
raymond
c.
fay
i...
certainly
malice
implicates
the
actual
intent,
and
recklessness
implicates
more
than
negligence
but
less
than
the
actual
intent,
in
terms
of
looking
at
the
mental
state.
what
i
was
referring
to
was
the
passage
in
smith
v.
wade,
in
footnote
10,
at
461
u.s.,
on
page
43,
and
in
the
text,
which
says
that
reckless
indifference
implicates
behavior
that
is
so
bad
that
it
becomes
the
equivalent
of
malicious
behavior.
that's
what
i
was
referring
to
in
that
context.
that
is,
in
terms
of
the
conduct.
mr.
raymond
c.
fay
and
my
point
is...
is
that
the
reckless
indifference
is
not
so
radically
different
from
the
malice
standard
that
it
becomes
a
statutory
standard
whereby
all
cases
of
intentional
discrimination
would
go
to
the
jury.
and--
mr.
raymond
c.
fay
--and
our
position
on
that,
your
honor,
frankly,
is
that
it's
better
not
to
establish
any
type
of
classes
of
cases
that
would
be
exempt
from
punitive
damages.
because
as
soon
as
someone
says,
well,
the
bfoq
case
won't
go
to
the
jury,
someone
else
will
come
back
and
say,
well,
that
bfoq
really
was
not
invoked
in
good
faith;
that
was
a
sham;
it
was
concocted
after
the
fact.
and
if
it's
egregious
enough,
why
shouldn't
that
case
go
to...
to
the
jury
on
punitive
damages?
so,
i
don't
think
there
should
be
any...
any--
mr.
raymond
c.
fay
--if
you
look
at
it
in
terms
of...
of
the
risk
of
harm
that
someone
is
put
to,
it...
it...
there
can
be
aggravating
circumstances,
where
someone
is
put
into
a
horrible
mental
state
because
of
the
actions
that
took
place
with
the
firing.
like
i
say,
it's
rare
that
it's
going
to
happen
in
the
economic
context,
but
perhaps
an--
mr.
raymond
c.
fay
--in...
earlier,
i
answered
a
question,
saying
that
the
interaction
between
the
plaintiff
and
the
defendant
might
make...
might
show
that
the
defendant's
behavior
is
more
serious.
mr.
raymond
c.
fay
timing
has
been
an
issue
in
the
case
law,
at...
that
is
cited
as
one
of
the
factors.
mr.
raymond
c.
fay
it
may...
it
very
well
may
be.
mr.
raymond
c.
fay
it
very
well
could
be.
because,
in
that
case,
the...
the
court
is
citing...
or
your
honor
is
citing
an
example
where
someone
knows
that,
in
terms
of
this
statute,
which
protects
against
various
types
of
discrimination,
that
harm
is
going
to
occur.
mr.
raymond
c.
fay
yes.
and
that...
that
is...
and
one
thing
i
think
we
all
agree
here
is
that
that
precise
issue
is
not
before
the
court.
but
i
did
want
to...
to
state
that...
that
we
believe--
mr.
raymond
c.
fay
--well,
the...
the
question
of...
of
the
difference
in
standards
that
was
referred
to
by
mr.
schnapper
and
the
solicitor
general
is
not
precisely
before
the
court.
but
we
would
submit
that
the
higher
agency
principles,
under
common
law,
would
apply
to
punitive
damages.
and
common
law--
mr.
raymond
c.
fay
--in...
in
direct
response
to
the
question,
the...
i
don't
think
the
petitioner
or
the
respondent
briefed
this
issue
at
length.
one
of
the
amicus
parties
did.
the
chamber
of
commerce,
in
its
brief,
starting
on
page
22,
did
explicate
the
common
law
to
show
that
there
is...
there
is
no
vicarious
liability
for
punitive
damages
at
common
law.
it
is
different
from
some
of
the
things
that
we've
been
discussing
today.
mr.
raymond
c.
fay
yes.
mr.
raymond
c.
fay
because--
mr.
raymond
c.
fay
--one...
one
way
i
can--
mr.
raymond
c.
fay
--one
way
to
describe
the
very
difference
in
approach
between
the
petitioner
and
the
respondent
here
is...
is
to
contrast
the
eeoc's
policy
guidance,
which
is
referred
to
in
the
government's
brief,
and
some
of
the
examples
that
the
government
gives
that
would
get
you
to
the
jury
on
punitive
damages.
and,
for
example,
they
say
resentment
of
federal
civil
rights
laws.
well,
that
may
be
unfortunate,
that
someone
resents
the
civil
rights
laws,
but
that,
in
and
of
itself,
should
not
get
you
to
the
jury
on
punitive
damages.
it
is
not
tied
to
discrimination
against
the
individual.
another
example
that--
mr.
raymond
c.
fay
--i...
i'm
reading
from
pages
11
and
12
of
the
government's
brief,
where
it
sets
forth
a
list
of
things
that
would
be
examples
to
go
to
the
jury.
and
i'm
saying
that
those...
those
examples
that...
that
the
government
gives,
that
have
only
to
do
with
the
isolated
mental
state,
without
reference
to
the
discriminatory
conduct
in
this
case,
are
not
appropriate
for
submission
to
the
jury.
sophistication
of
the
employer
is
another
one.
that's...
that's
something
that
should
have
nothing
to
do,
because
it
doesn't
have...
it
doesn't
describe
the
seriousness
of
the
discriminatory
conduct
at
issue.
the
eeoc's
policy
guidance,
also
cited
in
note
7
of
the
government's
brief,
on
page
11,
is
much
more
allegiant
to
the
statutory
standard.
mr.
raymond
c.
fay
yes.
mr.
raymond
c.
fay
in
that
instance,
we
are
focusing
solely
on
the
mental
state,
and
i
think
there
is
a
difference
to...
his
question,
as
i
understood
it,
was
if
somebody
knew
darn
well
that
they
were
violating
the
law.
mr.
raymond
c.
fay
that's
right.
mr.
raymond
c.
fay
because
he
was
posing
an
example...
i
thought
justice
breyer
was
posing
an
example
where
the
employer
knew
that
there
was
a
violation
of
the
law.
mr.
raymond
c.
fay
we
get
into
a...
a
different
area...
a
little
bit
different
area
where,
instead
of
actual
knowledge
of
an
intentional
violation,
someone
is
acting
recklessly
as
to...
as
to
whether
or
not
those
actions
are
in
violation.
mr.
raymond
c.
fay
but,
again,
i
don't...
i
don't
think
you
can
take
any
of
that
into
consideration
without
looking
at
the
statutory
framework,
which
says
we're
talking
about
punitive
damages--
mr.
raymond
c.
fay
--because
both
would
require
serious
actions.
thank
you.
