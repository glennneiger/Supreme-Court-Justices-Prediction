mr.
seth
p.
waxman
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
presents
to
the
court,
in
the
context
of
the
disabilities
act
and
title
vii,
very
much
the
same
questions
that
this
court
considered
under
the
adea
in
twa
v.
thurston
and
hazen
paper
company.
this
is
a
case
of
statutory
interpretation.
and
the
statute
provides
explicitly
that
in
cases
of
intentional
employment
discrimination
under
the
disabilities
act
or
title
vii,
punitive
damages
may
be
awarded.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
mr.
chief
justice,
it
is
entirely
appropriate
for
this
court,
and
other
courts,
to
proceed
on
the
assumption
that
punitive
damages
are
generally
not
favored
in
the
law,
and
that,
as
this
court
demonstrated
in
bmw
v.
gore,
there
are
constitutional
limitations
on
the
amount
of
punitive
damages
that
are
awarded.
but
in
this
case,
as
under
the
adea
that
this
court
considered
in
twa
and
hazen,
congress
has
made
that
determination,
and
it
has
explicitly
stated
what
standard
the
plaintiff
must
prove
before
the
jury
may
consider
the
independent
question
of
whether
punitive
damages
can
be
considered.
and
i
think
you
were
quite
right,
mr.
chief
justice...
i
think
it
was
you...
to
observe
that
as...
as
judge
randolph
did
in
his
concurring
decision
below,
that
traditionally,
at
law,
reckless
indifference,
or
reckless
disregard,
is
viewed
essentially
as
a
lesser
included
offense
of
knowledge.
the
reason
why
there
isn't
a
collapse
of
what
was
called
the
two
tiers
of
liability
here,
as
there
was...
as
this
court
found
there
was
not
under
the
adea,
is
that
the
two
tests
look
at
two
different
things.
in
order
to
establish
liability
for
intentional
violation,
you
look
at
the
volition
of
the
defendant.
that
is,
did
the
defendant
treat
someone
differently
on
the...
deliberately...
on
the
basis
of
a
prohibited
characteristic?
the
further
question
that
the
jury
has
to
consider
in
evaluating
whether
to
exercise
its
discretionary
moral
judgment
to
consider
punitive
damages
is
the
defendant's
consciousness
of
wrongdoing.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
well,
clearly,
the
defendant
in
the
case
is
the
employer.
and
although
this
court
has
never
directly
confronted
the
issue,
the
lower
courts
are
unanimous
that
individual
employees
or
supervisors
may
not
be
sued
under
title
vii
and,
i
think
presumably,
analogously,
under
the
disabilities
act.
so,
in
a
case,
which
i...
i
agree
with
mr.
schnapper,
is
not
really
presented
here
because
the
two
officials
that--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--well--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--i
think
our
position
on
it,
justice
o'connor...
let
me
first
say
that,
following
this
court's
decisions
in
faragher
and
ellerth
last
spring,
there
has
already
developed
a
split
in
the
circuits,
between
the
fifth
and
the
11th
circuit,
in
cases,
both
coincidentally
involving
wal-mart,
over
whether
the
paradigm
that
this
court
created
in
faragher
and
ellerth
should
be
directly
applied
to
punitive
damages,
or
whether
you
should
do
what
the...
whether
you
should
start
from
the
place
this
court
began
in
those
cases.
which
is
to
say,
we
know
we
have
to
look
at
traditional
agency
principles
and
we
have
to
look
at
the
purposes
of
title
vii.
now,
justice
scalia
was
quite
right
that
traditional
agency
principles
apply
differently
in
the
case
of
punitive
damages
than
they
do
in
the
case
of
compensatory
damages.
in
faragher
and
ellerth,
this
court,
i
would
say,
expressed
considerable
doubt
over
whether
somebody
who
was
engaging
in...
an
employee
or
a
supervisor
engaging
in
sexual
harassment
that
did
not
rise
to
the
level
of
a
tangible
employment
action
could
ever
be
said
to
be
acting
within
the
scope
of
employment.
and
i
think
that's
correct.
but
the
court
found
that
a
comp...
an
employer
might,
nonetheless,
be
liable
because
one
could
say
that,
with
reference
to
traditional
agency
principles,
the
supervisor
was
aided
in
the
agency
relationship.
now,
at
common
law...
and
this
is
reflected
in
restatement...
the
restatement,
second,
of
torts,
909,
and
the
restatement
of
agency,
217(c),
which
are
identical:
an
employer
is
vicariously
liable
for
punitive
damages
only
if
the
employee
acted
in
a
managerial
capacity
within
the
scope
of
employment.
now,
the...
the
eeoc,
prior
to
faragher
and
ellerth...
and
i
don't
think
this
court's
opinion
changes
it
any...
has
taken
the
position
that
if
a
supervisor,
vested
with
the
company's
authority
to
hire
or
fire,
fires
somebody
in
an
act
of
intentional
discrimination,
the
company...
the
jury
may
consider
whether
or
not
punitive
damages
may
be
awarded.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
well,
no.
but
it...
it
is...
the
eeoc...
these
are
the
instructions
that
it
requests
from
the
jury,
and
this...
this
is
the
position--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--the
eeoc,
your
honor,
under
title
vii,
is
a
plaint...
is
a
plaintiff
in
very
many
of
these
cases.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
oh,
sure.
the
eeoc
has
no
authority
under
the
statute
to
dictate
jury
instructions.
it
does
have
general
enforcement
and
interpretive
authority
with
respect
to
title
vii.
the
question
was,
what
position
has
the
united
states
taken?
and
the
united
states
is
in
court
most
frequently
on
this
in
the
posture
of
the
eeoc
as
a
plaintiff.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
i
haven't
fin--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--i
would...
our
position,
justice
o'connor,
is
that
in
cases
resulting
in
tangible
employment
consequences,
as
in
this
case,
the
eeoc--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--not
fired...
not
fired,
not
hired,
demoted,
promoted.
the
way
this
court
used
those
terms
in
faragher
and
ellerth.
in
those
cases--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--in
those
cases,
we
believe
that
the...
the
principle
expressed
in
the
restatement,
that
if
the
employee
acted
in
a
managerial
capacity
and
was
within
the
scope
of
his
employment,
the
company
is
liable
for
punitive
damages
in
the
jury's
discretion.
and
we
have--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--that...
that...
what
i've
told
you--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--well,
what
i've...
the
articulation
i've
given
you
is
verbatim
out
of
the
restatement
of
torts.
we
have
a...
maybe
it's
an
interpretation
of
that...
we've
interpreted
"managerial
capacity"
to
include
regional
supervisors
and
store
managers
who
have
authority
to
fire,
where
there
is
a
tangible
employment
action.
in
the
area
of
sexual
harassment,
where
there
may
not
be
a
tangible
employment
relation...
consequence,
as
in
the
case...
as
this
court
considered
in
faragher
and
ellerth...
as
a
result
of
faragher
and
ellerth,
the
eeoc
is
in
fact
at
this
point
evaluating
its
position
and
trying
to
come
to
a
conclusion
as
to
the
position
that
it
will
advocate
in
those
cases,
which
actually
have--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--almost
never
arisen.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
well,
i
think
that
the
jury
ought
to
be
charged
in
the
language
of
the
statute
that
congress
set
out.
that
is,
the
jury
ought
to
be
told
that
before
you
can
award
punitive
damages,
you
must...
compensatory
damages...
you
must
find
that
the
defendant
intentionally
discriminated.
that
is,
treated
this
person--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--well,
that--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--well,
if
the...
if
the...
if--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--the
answer
is
certainly
yes.
i
would
say
further--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--well,
with
respect
to
punitive
damages--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--no.
i
think
the
instruction
would
be,
and
all
the
pattern
instructions,
not
just
with
respect
to
this
statute,
but
with
respect
to
liability
under
the
civil
rights
statutes
generally,
under
smith
v.
wade,
instruct
the
jury...
and
may
i
just
finish
this
sentence...
instruct
the
jury
in
the
language
of
the
statute.
which
is
that
you
may
consider
but
are
not
required
to
impose
punitive
damages
if
you
find
that
the
defendant
acted
with
malice
or
with
reckless
indifference
to
the
employee's
federally
protected
rights.
thank
you.
