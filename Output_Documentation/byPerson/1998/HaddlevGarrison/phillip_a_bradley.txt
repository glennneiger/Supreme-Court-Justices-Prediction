mr.
phillip
a.
bradley
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
issue
before
you
today
is
whether
this
court
will,
for
the
first
time
in
more
than
125
years
since
the
reconstruction
era
enactments,
construe
the
words,
quote,
injured
in
person
or
property,
close
quote,
to
include
the
termination
of
at-will
employment.
there
are
three
bases
that
i
would
like
to
review
today
as
to
why
the
court
should
not
embark
on
the
path
suggested
by
petitioner
and
the
government
which
would
result
in
a
significant
federal
involvement
in
the
employer-employee
relationship
traditionally
reserved
to
state
law.
number
one,
the
terms
to
be
construed
in
this
case
have
potentially
far-reaching
implications
both
within
the
statute
itself
and
in
the
other
reconstruction
era
enactments.
number
two,
the
interpretation
proposed
by
the
petitioner
and
the
government
simply
is
inaccurate.
and
number
three,
the
recent
pronouncement
of
the
georgia
court
of
appeals
on
the
issue
of
whether
employment
at
will
constitutes
property
within
the
meaning
of
georgia
law.
mr.
phillip
a.
bradley
this
statute
does
not
provide
a
remedy.
mr.
phillip
a.
bradley
there
are
other
statutes
that
might
provide
a
remedy
to
that
same
employee.
mr.
phillip
a.
bradley
that's
correct.
mr.
phillip
a.
bradley
that's
correct,
and
that
goes
to
the
heart
of
where
i
think
the
government
confuses
the
issue
in
this
case,
and
that
is
whether
you're
talking
about
an
element
of
damages
versus
a
substantive
facet
of
the
tort
itself.
certainly
if
justice
scalia
were
to
run
over
my
colleague,
mr.
armstrong,
and
he
was
to
lose
time
at
work,
the
element
of
special
damages
of
lost
wages
would
be
recoverable.
that
doesn't
mean
that
there
is
property
interest
in
that
employment
at
will,
though.
that's
a
different
issue
as
to
whether
or
not
i
have
injured
something
of
property.
the
injury
in
that
case
was
the
bodily
injury
of
the
person
who
was
run
over.
mr.
phillip
a.
bradley
it
was--
mr.
phillip
a.
bradley
--but
the
damages
remedy
would
not
exist
but
for
the
property...
i
mean...
excuse
me...
the
personal
injury
that
occurred.
mr.
phillip
a.
bradley
keeping
in
mind,
though,
justice
souter,
that
with
respect
to
the
element
of
lost
wages
in
the
tort
case
that
we're
talking
about,
you
would
be
looking
to
the
wages
that
were
lost
up
to
the
time
of
trial.
in
an
employment
at
will--
mr.
phillip
a.
bradley
--you
may
or
may
not
under
georgia
tort
law.
you
would
have
to
prove
with
a
sufficient
certainty
that
there
would
have
been
an
expectation
of
earnings.
mr.
phillip
a.
bradley
that's
correct.
mr.
phillip
a.
bradley
i
would
not
say
so,
your
honor.
mr.
phillip
a.
bradley
in
that
circumstance
where
you
had
a
3-year
contract,
the
federal
remedy
would
be
coextensive
with
the
state
law.
mr.
phillip
a.
bradley
of
this
kind
of
conspiracy?
mr.
phillip
a.
bradley
i
cannot,
your
honor.
mr.
phillip
a.
bradley
your
honor,
that
was
a
different
enactment
at
a
different
period
of
time,
but--
mr.
phillip
a.
bradley
--it
has
a
similar
meaning
but
not
identical.
the...
the
reiter
v.
sonotone
case,
which
is
what
the
petitioner
and
the
government
rely
on,
talk
about
the
situation
in
which
there
is
a
deprivation
of
property
to
which
the
person
already
has
an
existing
right.
mr.
phillip
a.
bradley
i
don't
know
that
there
is
a
significant
difference
as
you've
couched
it.
i
also
don't
think
that
there
is
a
difference
in
meaning
between
the
term
property,
as
used
in
the
fourteenth
amendment,
which
was
enacted
at
roughly
the
same
time
as
section
1985--
mr.
phillip
a.
bradley
--but
the
word
property
is
the
same
in
both
statutes.
mr.
phillip
a.
bradley
no,
sir.
mr.
phillip
a.
bradley
in
an
employment
at
will
situation--
mr.
phillip
a.
bradley
--there's
an
expectation
of
money
for...
for
services
rendered.
mr.
phillip
a.
bradley
nothing
in
the
future.
mr.
phillip
a.
bradley
he
certainly
hopes
that
that's
the
case.
mr.
phillip
a.
bradley
under
georgia
law,
you
would
have
an
expectation
that
a
third
party
would
not
interfere
with
your
contractual--
mr.
phillip
a.
bradley
--for
a
number
of
reasons,
justice
breyer.
number
one,
i
turn
the
court's
attention
back
to
the
paul
v.
davis
case
in
which
the
issue
was
whether
or
not
reputation
was
property
for
purposes
of
a
section
1983
deprivation
of
property
action.
and
this
court
specifically
rejected
the
notion
that
it
was
a...
it
was
property
to...
anything
that
was
recognizable
injury
in
an
ordinary
tort
suit
was
property
for
purposes
of
section
1983.
mr.
phillip
a.
bradley
you
have
to
distinguish
between
constitutionally
protected
rights,
the
privileges
and
immunities
of
citizenship,
which
are
different
than
property
which
is
simply
protected
by
procedural
due
process.
and
the...
the
court's
rulings
are
uniform,
that
to
define
property
for
procedural
due
process
purposes,
you
look
outside
the
constitution
to
such
places
as
state
law.
mr.
phillip
a.
bradley
this
court
has
never
held
at-will
employment
to
be
property
in
that
context.
mr.
phillip
a.
bradley
there
are
not
many
statutes
that
use
that
precise
phrase,
injury
to
person
or
property.
i
would
like
to
take
you,
if
i
may,
justice
scalia,
to
this
particular
statute
and
look
at
some
of
the
scenarios
that
arise
if
you
construe
injury
to
person
or
property
in
this
particular
context
to
mean
what
the
petitioner
and
the
government--
mr.
phillip
a.
bradley
--one
of
our
arguments
is
that
when
you
look
at
the
fourteenth
amendment
use
of
property
as
enacted
in
the
reconstruction
era,
that
that
has
instructive
if
not
the
identical
meaning
as
property
is
used
in
this
context.
mr.
phillip
a.
bradley
first
of
all,
your
honor,
i
would
point
out
that
there
are
modifying
terms
in
the
statute
that
involve
the
use
of
force,
intimidation,
or
threat
which
suggest
that
you're
talking
about
something
other
than
an
inchoate
interest
such
as
property.
number
two,
if
you
focus
on
what
the
concept
of
employment
at
will
was
at
the
time
this
statute
was
enacted,
you
must
keep
in
mind
that
the...
that
the
country
was
coming
out
of
an
era
where
the
employment
relationship
with
the
people
primarily
intended
to
be
protected
by
the
statute
was
slavery,
where
the
employee
was
the
property
of
the
employer.
we
then
shifted
into
an
era
that's
described
by
h.g.
wood
in
the
law
of
master
&
servant
back
in
1877
of
a
pure
at-will
employment,
where
the
employer
had
the
right
to
employ,
the
employee
had
the
right
to
work,
but
there
was
no
compulsion
between
the
two.
one
was
free
to
go
as
to
the
other.
that...
that
type
of
relationship
is
discussed
and
described
in
this
court's
opinion
in
arnett
v.
kennedy
which
discussed
the
federal
relationship
of
employer
and
employee.
and
in
this
era
in
the
late
1800s,
it
was
purely
a
patronage
system
where
if
the
employer
wanted
to
keep
the
employee,
that
was
fine.
if
the
employee
wanted
to
leave,
that
was
fine
as
well.
mr.
phillip
a.
bradley
employment
was
not
considered
something
that
was
going
to
be
injured
because
there
was
the
freedom
to
move
both
on
the
side
of
the
employer
and
on
the
side
of
the
employee.
mr.
phillip
a.
bradley
because
the--
mr.
phillip
a.
bradley
--because
the
employee
had
the--
mr.
phillip
a.
bradley
--no,
because
the
employee
had
the
unfettered
discretion
to
move
to
work
wherever
he
wanted.
mr.
phillip
a.
bradley
well,
whether
somebody
would
prefer
to
have
something
and
whether
they
have
a
property
interest
in
it
are
two
different
things.
mr.
phillip
a.
bradley
that's
correct.
mr.
phillip
a.
bradley
your
honor,
where
there
is
injury
to
a
recognized
property
interest--
mr.
phillip
a.
bradley
--i
don't
necessarily
agree
with
that,
your
honor.
mr.
phillip
a.
bradley
that's
correct,
justice
scalia.
with
respect
to
the
particular
language
of
this
statute,
which
is
reprinted
in
the
appendix
to
the
gray
brief,
there
are...
the
terms
injury
to
person
or
property
are
used
throughout
the
entirety
of
section
1985,
not
simply
in
1985(3).
and
there
are
a
number
of
interests
other
than
testimony
at
court
that
are
protected
by
section
1985,
and
if
you
apply
the
government
and
the
petitioner's
reasoning
in
this
particular
context,
you
could
have
such
situations
as...
as
the
following.
with
respect
to
section
1985(1),
if--
mr.
phillip
a.
bradley
--it's
in
the
appendix
to
the
gray
brief.
mr.
phillip
a.
bradley
it's
the
last
couple
of
pages.
under
section
1985(1),
subpart
1,
there's
a
prohibition
to
prohibit
by
force--
mr.
phillip
a.
bradley
--it's
1a,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
phillip
a.
bradley
prohibition
by
force,
intimidation,
or
threat
from
any
person
accepting
or
holding
office,
trust,
or
place
of
confidence
in
a
position
with
the
united
states.
using
my
colleague,
mr.
armstrong,
as
the
example
again,
let's
assume
that
mr.
armstrong
came
to
me
and
said
that
he
wanted
to
take
a
position
in
a...
with
a
federal
commission
somewhere,
not
a
full-time
job,
but
a
particular
federal
appointment.
mr.
phillip
a.
bradley
certainly
for
cause
of
action
under
this
particular
statute,
setting
aside
the
equal
protection
issues,
there
must
be
a
federal
wrong.
but
let's
assume
mr.
armstrong
comes
to
me
and
says,
i
want
to
take
this
federal
position
and
a
client
for
whom
mr.
armstrong
works
significantly
says,
wait
a
minute,
we
can't
have
mr.
armstrong
leaving
to
go
work
for
this
federal
commission.
that's
not
going
to
work
out
for
us.
you
need
to
get
rid
of
him
if
that's
going
to
happen.
and
we
fire
him.
under
the
government
and
the
petitioner's
view
of
this
statute,
that
creates
a
federal
remedy
because
he's
now
been
injured
in
his
person
or
property
by
the
termination
of
his
employment.
if
you
look
at
the
section
in
1985(3)
on
page
2a
where
it
talks
about
advocacy
in
voting,
if
mr.
armstrong
were
to
decide
to
become
the
campaign
manager
for
a
particular
candidate
and
that
candidate
was
taking
a
position
that
was
strongly
adverse
to
one
of
the
firm's
clients,
then
we...
the
client
comes
to
us
and
says,
you've
got
to
get
rid
of
mr.
armstrong.
he's
hurting
us.
and
we
fire
mr.
armstrong.
under
the
government
and
the
petitioner's
reading
of
this
statute,
mr.
armstrong
has
a
cause
of
action.
what
that
leaves
you
with
is
under
their
interpretation
of
this
statute,
mr.
armstrong
as
a
private
employee
has
greater
rights
vis-a-vis
his
employer
than
a
public
employee
would,
and
that
is
stretching
the
scope
of
this
statute
way
beyond
the
scope
of
what
was
intended.
if
you
take
the
particular
provision
we're
dealing
with
here
with
respect
to
a
federal
investigation
of
an
employer,
not
uncommon,
for
example,
in
the
health
care
industry,
particularly
in
this
case,
an
employer
comes
under
investigation,
multitudes
of
its
employees
are
called
before
a
grand
jury.
because
of
the
investigation,
there's
a
downturn
in
business,
and
the
employer
then
lays
off
a
number
of
employees.
every
one
of
those
employees
who's
laid
off
now
has
a
prima
facie
case
of
a
violation
of
this
statute.
mr.
phillip
a.
bradley
correct.
mr.
phillip
a.
bradley
but
only
if
they
have
term
contracts,
not
employees
at
will.
therefore,
to
interpret
this
statute
in
the
manner
proposed
by
petitioner
and
government--
mr.
phillip
a.
bradley
--no,
sir.
there
are
statutes
already
on
the
books
that
address
that
particular
situation,
both
from
the
government's
standpoint
of
the
interest
of
protecting
the
federal
system
and
also
from
the
employee's
standpoint.
there
are
obstruction
statutes
that
would
prohibit
the
employer
from--
mr.
phillip
a.
bradley
--18
u.s.c.,
section
1514--
mr.
phillip
a.
bradley
--provides
for
a
civil
action
to
restrain
the
harassment
of
a
victim
or
a
witness.
that
would
be
one
civil
remedy.
the
false
claims
act,
particularly
again
in
the
health
care
arena,
would
be--
mr.
phillip
a.
bradley
--it's
the
government's
remedy
to
restrain
harassment
of
a
victim
or
a
witness.
mr.
phillip
a.
bradley
mr....
mr.
haddle
could
have
asserted
a
claim
for
witness
retaliation
under
the
false
claims
act,
37
u.s.c....
excuse
me...
30
u.s.c.
3730.
he
chose
not
to.
mr.
phillip
a.
bradley
that
provides
that
for
any
person
who
participates
in
a
cause
of
action
filed
or
to
be
filed...
and
under
the
eleventh
circuit
law,
to
be
filed
means
there
is
a
reasonable
possibility
of
it
being
filed...
and
their
employment
is
terminated,
that
they
have
a
cause
of
action
against
their
employer.
mr.
phillip
a.
bradley
yes,
explicitly
covers
witnesses.
it
does
not
have
to
be
a
person
who
actually
filed
the
false
claims
action.
it
is
any
witness
who
participates
in
that
false
claims
act
investigation.
so,
there
is
a
protection
under
federal
law
for
witnesses
such
as
mr.
haddle.
he
simply
elected
not
to
pursue
that
remedy,
but
instead
pursue
this
civil
rights
act
remedy.
mr.
phillip
a.
bradley
o'neal.
mr.
phillip
a.
bradley
mr.
o'neal
did
assert
a
false
claims
act
retaliation
action
against
his
employer.
mr.
phillip
a.
bradley
no.
actually
he
received
a
verdict
on
that
particular
claim,
not
against
any
party
to
this
case,
but
against
another
company.
mr.
phillip
a.
bradley
is?
mr.
phillip
a.
bradley
he
can
get
it
under
both
of
them.
mr.
phillip
a.
bradley
mr.
haddle's
articulated
reason
for
not
proceeding
with
the
false
claims
act
action
in
his
brief
is
that
the
particular
company
that
was
his
employer
was
in
bankruptcy,
but
that
doesn't
mean
that
that
eliminates
his
right.
and
in
fact,
that
particular
company
in
bankruptcy
ended
up
generating
far
more
dollars
than
anybody
would
have
believed.
he
simply
elected
not
to
pursue
the
remedy
that
was
available
to
him
and
to
try
to
concoct
a
remedy
out
of
this
old
civil
rights
statute
which
has
never
been
used
to
protect
employment
at
will.
the
recent
case
that
we
filed
with
our
supplemental
brief
is
robbins
v.
federal
credit
union,
and
i
do
think
it's
an
important
case
for
those
who
may
look
and
say,
we
are
looking
to
state
law
to
determine
whether
or
not
a
property
interest
is
involved.
that
case,
which
was
recently
decided,
you
had
an
employee
who
was
an
employee
of
a
federal
credit
union,
initially
took
the
position
that
makes
me
a
federal
employee
and
therefore
i
am
protected
by
various
statutes,
but
asserted
a
cause
of
action
for
wrongful
termination
and
for
tortious
interference
under
georgia
law.
the
georgia
court
of
appeals
looked
at
that
and
said,
we
have
an
exception
creating
a
property
interest
for
public
employees
when
they
can
be
fired
only
with
cause.
however,
with
respect
to
private
employees,
we
are
not
going
to
make
any
such
exception.
we're
not
going
to
imply
a
with-cause
requirement,
and
therefore,
for
private
employees,
there
simply
is
no
property
interest
in
your
employment
at
will,
and
there
would
not
be
a
cause
of
action
under
georgia
law
for
the
termination
of
at-will
employment.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
thank
you.
