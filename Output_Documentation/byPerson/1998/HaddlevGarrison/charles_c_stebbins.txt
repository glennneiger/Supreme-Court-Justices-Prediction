mr.
charles
c.
stebbins
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
is
about
whether
there
is
any
federal
civil
remedy
for
a
federal
witness
in
the
position
of
my
client
who
was
fired
from
his
job
of
10
years'
standing
because
he
responded
to
a
federal
subpoena,
appeared
at
a
federal
grand
jury
proceeding,
prepared
to
testify
as
to
facts
involving
a
federal
health
care
fraud
investigation.
mr.
charles
c.
stebbins
yes,
your
honor.
under
georgia
law,
as
stated
in
the
leading
supreme
court
case
of
georgia
power
company
v.
busbin,
which
is
cited
in
the
brief,
there
is
a
cause
of
action
for
tortious
interference
with
at-will
employment
which
can
be
brought
by
the
at-will
employee
for
damages
against
any
person
other
than
his
employer
and
those
who
share
the
immunity
of
the
employer
under
state
law.
mr.
charles
c.
stebbins
yes,
your
honor.
it's
my
view
that
that
case
doesn't
illuminate
anything
about
this
case
whatsoever.
i'm
surprised
that
it
was
cited.
in
that
case,
the
robbins
decision...
georgia
has
a
strong
at-will
policy
that
the
employer
can
never
be
liable
for
discharging
his
at-will
employee.
in
the
robbins
case,
the
employee
contended
that
because
he
was
an
employee
of
a
federal
credit
union,
he
had
a
federal
statutory
right
to
notice
and
hearing
before
he
was
discharged.
the
georgia
supreme
court
found
that
an
employee
of
a
federal
credit
union
is
not
an
employee
of
a
federal
agency
and
has
no
statutory
federal
right
to
anything
more
than
any
other
at-will
employee.
the
case
does
not
change
georgia
law
in
any
respect
as
to
that
issue.
mr.
charles
c.
stebbins
your
honor,
under...
under
georgia
law,
the
action
is
characterized
as
an
injury
to
property.
however,
in
general
common
law
among
the
jurisdictions,
as
i
pointed
out
in
the
brief,
some
jurisdictions
characterize
this
as
an
injury
to
the
person,
others
as
an
injury
to
property.
what
is
the
case
is
that
all
jurisdictions
characterize
it
as
either
an
injury
to
person
or
property,
thereby
falling
within
the
language
that
congress
used
when
it
gave
a...
a
federal
recovery
under
this
federal
tort
that
congress
created
for
anyone
who
was
injured
in
his
person
or
property.
mr.
charles
c.
stebbins
under
the
federal
statute,
your
honor,
i'm
not
sure
whether
it
would
be
or
not.
i
believe
the
answer
to
that
question
would
be
the
same
answer
that
would
be
given
if
this
were
a
case
premised
on
title
7
or
section
1981
or
section
1982
or
any
other
federal
law
that
provides
for
liability
for
discrimination
in
employment
of
some
kind.
congress
is
legislating,
as
the
court
has
often
recognized,
against
the
background
of
general
tort
law.
i
think
the
issue
would
be
whether
the
emotional
damage
rose
to
the
level
that
it
would
be
compensated
under
ordinary
tort
law
principles.
mr.
charles
c.
stebbins
well,
i
believe,
your
honor,
that
a
federal
tort
created
by
congress
should
be
governed
by
a
uniform
federal
rule
of
damages.
it
may
borrow
from
state
law
rules,
but
i
believe
when
it
does
so,
it
should
borrow
from
the
general
common
law
tradition
as
embodied
in
the
laws
and
the
decisions
of
all
the
states.
i
don't
think
it
would
be
appropriate.
i
think
it
would--
mr.
charles
c.
stebbins
--your
honor,
i
agree--
mr.
charles
c.
stebbins
--because
this
section
of
1985
is
not
premised
on
the
fourteenth
amendment
and,
in
fact,
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
fourteenth
amendment.
this
is
the
teaching
of
this
court
in
kush
v.
rutledge;
was
made
explicit
in
united
brotherhood
of
carpenters
v.--
mr.
charles
c.
stebbins
--no,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
c.
stebbins
no,
your
honor,
i
don't
say
that.
i
would
first
point
out
that
the
chances
of
such
a
case
arising
are
very
small
and
they
don't
arise
here--
mr.
charles
c.
stebbins
--well,
again,
your
honor,
i
say
this,
that
when
congress
uses
the
phrase,
injured
in
his
person
or
property,
when
it
used
this
phrase
in
1871,
to
create
a
tort,
not
in
the
context
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
where
we're
talking
about
the
adjustment
of
authority
between
the
state
and
federal
government,
i
believe
that
the
content
that
has
to
be
given
to
the
term,
injury
to
person
or
property,
in
the
first
instance
has
got
to
be
drawn
from
what
you
might
say
is
the
common
meaning
of
the
terms.
now,
i
hasten
to
add
that
in
this
case
it's
not
a
significant
distinction
because
the
georgia
law
clearly
recognizes
that
my
client
had
a,
quote,
valuable
property
right,
end
quote.
that's
the
georgia
court
of
appeals
in
troy
v.
interfinancial.
he
had
a,
quote,
valuable
property
right,
end
quote,
in
his
at-will
employment.
so,
if
you
refer--
mr.
charles
c.
stebbins
--yes,
your
honor,
i
understand
that.
and
it
would
be
my
contention
that
although
there
are
difficulties
with
the
idea
that
when
congress
says
injured
in
his
person
or
property,
it
is
not
referring
directly
to
state
law
for
the
meaning
of
property.
the
difficulties
that
would
be
inherent
in
taking
the
other
position
would
be
more
serious
for
the
power
of
the
federal
government
to
operate
within
its
own
sphere.
for
instance,
if
a
state
should
take
it
into
its
head
to
declare
that
any
number
of
things
are
not
property
which
the
congress
intended
to
protect
when
it
protected
its
witness,
the
state
might
say
that
no
contractual
right
is
property
either,
but
nobody
would
buy
that
because
we--
mr.
charles
c.
stebbins
--well,
i
don't
know
about
that,
your
honor.
when
the
act--
mr.
charles
c.
stebbins
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
c.
stebbins
that's
true,
but
there's
also
a
very...
it's
very
unlikely
in
my
opinion
that
the
federal
government
and
the
state
government
will
disagree
as
to
what
property
means.
what's
happened
in
this
case
is
that
the
federal
and
state
governments
have
disagreed
as
to
who
may
have
a
recovery...
rather,
as
to
who
may
be
liable
for
an
invasion
of
property.
mr.
charles
c.
stebbins
your
honor,
my
only
answer
to
that
is
that
i
agree
with
your
honor,
and
i
didn't
mean
to
confine
myself
to--
mr.
charles
c.
stebbins
--i
believe
the
son-in-law
has
been
injured,
your
honor,
and
i
think
he
would
have
a
claim.
mr.
charles
c.
stebbins
but
i
don't
think
you
would
have
a
claim.
mr.
charles
c.
stebbins
yes,
your
honor.
i
think
i
have
to
go
somewhere
down
the
middle
between
what--
mr.
charles
c.
stebbins
--well,
i
think
that
the
tort
law
concepts
have
got
to
have
some
relevance
to
the
inquiry
whether
there
has
been
a
sufficient
injury
to
person
or
property--
mr.
charles
c.
stebbins
--that's
correct,
your
honor,
and
i
tried
to
illustrate
that
by
reference
to
mid-19th
century
sources
to
indicate
that
that
was
the
intention
of
congress.
i
cited
to
blackstone
and
to
cobb's
georgia
code
as
showing
that
at
the
time,
and
for
all
i
know
now,
all
injuries
that
would
be
compensable--
mr.
charles
c.
stebbins
--your
honor,
i
would
not
think
it
was,
and
this
is
why
general
tort
law
is
relevant
to
the
determination
of
what
the
scope
of
injury
to
person
or
property
is.
mr.
charles
c.
stebbins
i
think
it
would
depend
on
the
degree
of
the
emotional
distress.
mr.
charles
c.
stebbins
yes.
mr.
charles
c.
stebbins
i
believe
that
would
be
an
injury
to
person,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
c.
stebbins
well--
mr.
charles
c.
stebbins
--i
believe
it
is,
your
honor,
but
i
would
like
to
say
that
general
tort
law
needs
to
inform
the
total
phrase
used
by
congress,
which
is
injured
in
his
person
or
property.
i
think
to...
to
parse
the
phrase
too
closely
would
perhaps
lead
to
results
that
were
not
intended.
i
think--
mr.
charles
c.
stebbins
--that's
true,
your
honor,
but
the
way
you
know
that
that's
true
is
you
look
at
the
way
the
phrase
injured
in
person
or
property
was
used
in
the
law
generally,
text
writers,
cases,
and
so
forth,
at
the
time
in
question.
i
agree
it
was
intended
from...
from
looking
at
the
applicable
general
background
of
legal
speech
that
was
available
at
the
time,
the
phrase
injured
in
his
person
or
property
was
intended
to
be
inclusive
of
the
universe
of
compensable
injuries
rather
than
exclusive
or
restrictive.
mr.
charles
c.
stebbins
your
honor,
again
this
same
question
comes
up,
say,
in
a
title
7
case
where
this
court
has
never
spoken
to
that
issue,
and
i
believe
there's
a
difference
of
opinion
among
the
circuits.
i
believe
in
our
circuit,
the
eleventh
circuit,
the
court
generally
holds
that
the
extent
of
compensation
available
will
be
measured
by
what
it
states
vaguely
as
a
reasonable
standard.
let's
suppose
that
the
employer
has
not
been
able
to
prevail
on
his
affirmative
defense
that
he
would
have
fired
the
person
anyway.
then,
of
course,
the
court
is
not
going
to
allow
damages
to
go
on
forever.
but
this
is
not
an
issue
that's
peculiar
to
section
1985,
part
2.
this
is
an
issue
that
exists
with
all
federal
anti-discrimination
laws
to
the
extent
that
they
affect
at-will
employment.
no--
mr.
charles
c.
stebbins
--well,
your
honor,
i
have
two
answers
to
that.
first
of
all,
the
most
direct
answer
would
be
that
when
congress
legislates
in
this
broad
manner
and
says,
injured
in
his
person
or
property,
i
believe
congress
expects
and
it
necessarily
follows
that
this
court
and
the
lower
courts,
the
courts
below,
are
going
to
develop
a
law
to
interpret
these
broad
terms,
and
that
law
is
going
to
change
over
time,
just
as
in
the
antitrust
laws
which
is
the
closest
analogy
in
terms
of
the
actual
words
used
where
there's
a
reference
to
injured
in
business
or
property.
this
court
is
then
faced
with
the...
and
the
lower
courts
are
faced
with
the
necessity
of
developing
the
law
as
cases
appear
before
it,
and
that's
a
necessary
concomitant
of
a
common
law
system.
but
i'd
also
like
to
say
more
specifically
i
understand
the...
the...
justice
scalia,
what
you
said
about
it
matters
to
you
all,
but
not
to
us,
but
i
do
want
not
to
lose
sight
of
the
fact
that
there
is
no
evidence
at
all
that
this
injury
was
not
compensable
at
common
law
at
the
time
or
that
it
would
not
be
compensable
under
the
state
law
of
the
state
of
georgia
to
somebody.
now,
i'd
like
to
reserve
any
further
time
i
have,
mr.
chief
justice,
if
there
are
no
further
questions.
mr.
charles
c.
stebbins
there
was
a
substantial
impediment
to
mr.
haddle
bringing
an
action
under
the
false
claims
act,
and
it
was
that
the
company
was
in
bankruptcy.
it
was
not
a
financial
consideration,
however.
i
was
there
and
made
the
decision.
the
fact
is
that
officially
mr.
haddle
was
terminated
by
the
united
states
trustee
in
bankruptcy.
this
was
a
result
of
a
conspiracy
among
these
respondents,
none
of
whom
were
the
employer,
to
feed
false
information
to
the
trustee
in
bankruptcy
who
was
duped
and
tricked
into
dismissing
mr.
haddle.
now,
i
couldn't
sue
the
trustee
in
bankruptcy.
he's
a...
a
well-respected
member
of
the
bar
in
augusta,
and
my
investigation
revealed
that
there
was...
he
had
not
done
anything
wrong.
he
was
completely
innocent.
so,
mr.
haddle
had
no
way
to
utilize
the
false
claims
act
in
order
to
remedy
this
situation.
mr.
o'neal
did
and
we
recovered
a
judgment,
a
verdict
which
is
on
appeal.
mr.
haddle
did
not
have
that
available.
and
i
would
observe
that
the
false
claims
act
is
a
relatively
narrow
provision
and
certainly
would
not
provide
a
suitable
alternate
remedy.
to
say
that
witnesses
who
have
an
at-will
employment
and
are
fired
because
they
have
testified
in
federal
court
have
an
adequate
remedy,
civil
remedy,
under
any
statute
that
i'm
aware
of
is
simply
not
the
case.
i
canvassed
the
statutes
just
as
widely
as
i
possibly
could
to
find
somebody
to
remedy
this
injury
to
mr.
haddle,
and
there
was
no
way
to
do
it.
this
brings
me
to
the
second
point
i
wanted
to
make
which
is
that
none
of
the
defendants
in
this
case
are
mr.
haddle's
employer,
and
under
georgia
law,
mr.
haddle
had
a
valuable
property
right
as
to
everyone
other
than
his
employer
which
is
protected
by
this
act
as
well
as
by
georgia
law.
and
i
would
refer
in
response
to
the
question
that
justice
souter
and
justice
rehnquist
gave...
asked
the
government
as
to
whether
it
makes
a
difference
if
only
the
employer
were
the
defendant.
that's
not
my
case,
but
i
would
refer
to
the
last
words
of
section
1985
which
provide
that
when
there
is
a
proscribed
conspiracy,
the
injured
party
shall
have
an
action
against
any
one
or
more
of
the
conspirators.
now,
i
couldn't
find
anything
in
the
legislative
history,
but
it
almost
appears
to
me
that
this
language
was
put
here
to
abrogate
any
immunity
that
the
employer
might
have
had
at
state
law.
that
appears
to
be
one
of
the
reasons.
