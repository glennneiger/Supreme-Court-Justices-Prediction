mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
petitioner
was
injured
in
his
person
or
property
because
he
lost
wages
when
he
was
fired
pursuant
to
a
conspiracy
prohibited
by
section
1985.
subsection
2
of
section
1985
protects
the
federal
courts
by
creating
a
federal
right
to
be
free
of
conspiracies
to
interfere
with
federal
witnesses--
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
--no,
your
honor.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
injury
to
person
or
property
was
a
term
of
art
with
a
well-established
meaning
at
common
law.
it
meant
a
loss
or
damage
that
was
compensable
in
a
tort
suit.
nothing
in
the
other
provisions
of
section
1985
or
its
legislative
history
warrants
a
departure
from
that
meaning
and,
indeed,
the
limited
legislative
history
on
point
confirms
it.
in
addition,
there's
no
question
that
lost
wages
were
compensable
in
1871
and
that
they
remain
so
today.
an
employee
who
loses
his
job
because
he's
struck
by
a
car
driven
negligently
can
recover
the
wages
he
has
lost,
and
he
can
recover
them
whether
or
not
his
employment
was
at
will.
petitioner,
who
was
deprived
of
wages
because
his
employment
was
terminated
by
a
conspiracy
prohibited
by
section
1985,
likewise
has
suffered
a
compensable
injury.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
it's...
it's
not
relevant
whether
the...
the
employer
is
the
party
or
not.
our...
our
point
is
not--
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
--the
wrong
and
the
tort
is
the
conspiracy
that
is
prohibited
by
the
second
clause
of
section
1985.
the
question
is
whether
there's
been
a
harm
or
a
loss
that
would
be
ordinarily
compensated
in
a
tort
suit,
and
lost
wages
are
that
kind
of
a
harm.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
the...
the
offense
is
conspiracy
to
deter
a
witness
from
testifying
truthfully
or
to
retaliate
against
a
witness
for
testifying
or
attending
court.
i...
i
don't
think
that
there's
any
question
that
the
employer
can
be
guilty
of
that...
of
that
wrong.
the
wrong
is
not
wrongful
discharge
or
tortious
interference
under
state
law.
the
wrong
is
the
wrong
that
is
prohibited
by
section
1985.
the
question
is
whether
there's
been
a
harm.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
that's...
that's
one
of
the
clauses.
the...
the
first
clause
of...
i
mean,
the
first
part--
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
--well,
i
believe
there
are
several.
there
are
several
relevant
clauses,
your
honor.
let
me...
let
me
try
to
explain.
the
petitioner
has
alleged
a
conspiracy
to
deter
him
and
others
from
testifying,
as
well
as
a
conspiracy
to
injure
him
because
he
testified.
i
think
what's
really
at
issue
before
the
court
is
the
remedy
clause
in
the
third
subsection
which
gives
the
petitioner
a
right
to
recover
the
damages
he
suffered
when
he
was
fired
pursuant
to
the
unlawful
conspiracy.
i
don't
think
there's
much
of
a
question
that
petitioner
has
alleged
a
conspiracy
that's
violated
by
this
subsection
2,
clause
i.
and
in
reference
to
the
question--
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
--you
could
not--
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
--you
could
not
conspire
to
injure
her
in
her
person
or
property
in
order...
on
account
of
her
testimony
in
federal
court.
yes,
the...
that...
if
the...
if
your
purpose
was
to
retaliate
against
her
for
her
truthful--
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
--truthful
testimony,
that...
that
would
be
covered
by
the
statute.
the
statute
is
trying
to
protect
the
federal
courts.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
i
don't
believe
so.
i
don't
believe
so--
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
--i
don't
believe
so,
your
honor.
the
statute
gives
a
cause
of
action
to
anyone
injured
in
person
or
property.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
no.
it
only
covers
conspiracy,
so--
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
--would
have
to
agree
together
for
that
improper
purpose
and
there
would
have
to
be
an
injury
that
was
compensable
in
a
tort
suit
in
order
for
it
to
be
covered.
in
addition,
the...
the
solution
to...
to
the
concern
that
you're
talking
about
can't
be
that
the
remedy
for
the
federal
right
that's
created
by
section
1985
should
depend
on
whether
the
person
whose
right
is
violated
has
an
independent
remedy
under
state
law.
congress
enacted
section
1985
precisely
because
it
was
concerned
that
state
remedies
were
unavailable
or
ineffective.
and
as
i
said
before,
the
purpose
of
the
statute
is
to
protect
the
federal
courts.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
you
must
be
injured
in
your...
the
person
whose
action
it...
it's
injured
in
his
person
or
property.
i
think
that
his
is
the
relevant
term
there
in
resolving
that
question.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
to
determine
whether
it's
his...
to
determine
whether
he
suffered
an
injury,
i
don't
know
if...
whether
you
have
to
go
to
state
law
or
not.
you...
if
there's
a
question--
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
--it's
a
factual
question
i
think,
but--
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
--i'm
sorry.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
i
apologize,
your
honor,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
i
think
that
if
the
house
belonged
to
another
person
under
georgia
law,
then
there
would...
it
would
not
be
an
injury
in
his
property
under
the
statute,
under
the
federal
statute.
it
would
be
no
injury
to
him
under
the
federal
statute.
so,
yes,
i
agree
that
if
there's
a
question
of
ownership--
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
--the...
the
question...
first...
first
of
all,
the...
as
i
said
before,
we
believe
that
the
phrase,
injured
in
person
or
property,
was
the
term
of
art
that
was
a
unified
meaning
and
that
it
encompassed
all
laws
that
were
to
be
compensable
under
tort
law.
even
if
you...
if
you
look
at
property
separately,
you
still
have
to
deal
with
the
question
of
whether
there
was
an
injury
to
person
here.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
i
think
this
court...
the
question--
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
--yes,
your
honor.
that
was
the
point
that...
that
i
was
trying
to
make,
that
there's
been
no
injury
to
you.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
i
still
think
the
answer
in
this
case
would
be
that
petitioner
has
a
cause
of
action.
the--
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
--because
the
tort,
the
wrong,
the
right
that's
been
violated
is
the
right
to
be
free
of
a
conspiracy
that's
prohibited
by
subsection
2
of
section
1985.
the
question
is
whether
there's
been
a
loss
or
a
harm
that
is
compensable
in
tort
law.
let
me...
let
me
try
to
phrase
it
another
way,
if
i
may,
to
see
if
i
can
explain...
explain
our
position.
this
might
be
viewed
as
a
federal
tort
that's
been
created
where,
in
order
to
have
a
damages
action,
one
of
the
elements
of
it
is
that
you
prove
damages.
that's
what
the
requirement
that
injured
in
a
person
or
property
requires.
to
answer
the
question
that...
that
justice
ginsburg,
for
example,
asked
petitioner,
we
don't
believe
that
the
statute
would
mean
the
same
thing
if
it
said
injured
as
opposed
to
saying
injured
in
person
or
property.
the
in
person
or
property
requirement
does
clarify
that
it's
a
broad
coverage,
but
it
also
limits
coverage.
there
can't
be
a
suit
just
for
nominal
damages.
there
can't
be
a
suit
unless
the
petitioner...
unless
the
plaintiff
alleges
that...
and
proves
that
he
has
suffered
an
injury
that's
compensable
in
tort
law.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
the
property
is
the
lost
wages
that
you
would
have
received
but
for
the
federal
wrong,
the
wrong
in
violation
of
federal
law.
just
as
in
mt.
healthy
when
the
at-will
employee
was
fired
in
violation
of
the
first
amendment,
he
could
recover
his
lost
wages.
it's
difficult--
