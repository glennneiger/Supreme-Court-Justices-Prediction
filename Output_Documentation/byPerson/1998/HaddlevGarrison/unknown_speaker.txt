unknown
speaker
would
you
clarify
for
us
what
the
status
of
georgia
law
is
on
the
subject
of
recoverability
for
at-will
employment
discharge?
unknown
speaker
now,
there
was
a
supplemental
brief
calling
the
court's
attention
to
some
new
case.
unknown
speaker
could...
could
this
be
considered,
the
loss
of
job,
an
injury
to
the
person
under
georgia
law
as
opposed
to
property?
unknown
speaker
so,
if
the
injury
were
purely
an
emotional
injury
as
a
result
of
what
happened,
would
that
be
recoverable
in
your
view?
unknown
speaker
you
say
general
tort
law.
so
it
is
important
to
you
that
not
only
would
georgia
give
relief
in
this
situation,
but
that,
as
you
say,
other
states
would
all
give
relief.
suppose
georgia
alone
would
give
relief.
unknown
speaker
but
under
the
fourteenth
amendment,
generally
we
look
to
state
law
for
the
definition
of
property.
unknown
speaker
and
why
should
we
not
do
the
same
here?
unknown
speaker
suppose
the
state
of...
suppose
somebody
is
injured
in...
in
property
which
the
state
of
georgia
would
not
say
was
his
property.
are
we
going
to
adopt
a
federal
law
of
property?
unknown
speaker
i
mean,
a
particular
property
is
damaged
by...
by
the
miscreant
under
this
statute.
and,
you
know,
the
threshold
question
is,
whose
property
is
it?
you
say
we
adopt
a
federal
rule?
unknown
speaker
so,
you
acknowledge
we
look
to
the
state
law
for
whose
property
it
is,
but
then
you
want
us
to
create
a
general
federal
law
to...
as
to
whether
there
has
been
a...
been
a
tort
or
not.
unknown
speaker
it's
not
important
to
you,
but
it's
important
to
us.
unknown
speaker
those
people
going
to
get
reelected
when
they--
unknown
speaker
--most
unlikely.
i
mean,
isn't
there
a
significant
deterrent
for
the
state
to...
to
modify
its...
its
internal
law
just
to
spite
the
federal
government?
unknown
speaker
they're
not
going
to
do
that.
unknown
speaker
well,
in...
in
order
to
get
to
that
issue,
why
do
you
look
to
tort
law
as
such
as
opposed
to
going
directly
to
the
statute
and
saying
the
purpose
of
the
statute
seems
to
have
been
to
protect
people
from
getting
hurt
for
testifying?
and
therefore
the
injury
that
the
statute
must
be...
must
be
referring
to
would
be
anything
that
a
witness
or
potential
witness
would
regard
as
enough
of
an
injury
to
induce
that
witness
not
to
testify
or
to
fear
that
he
would
be
hurt
if
he
did
testify.
and
if
you
look
at
it
that
way,
you
don't
look
to
tort
law
as
such,
though
tort
law
may
be...
be
helpful
in
suggesting
things
to
you,
you...
you
look
to
the
way
witnesses
are
going
to
be
motivated
by
what
happens
to
them.
and
if
you
do
that,
you
have
a
concept
of
injury
which
i
suppose
would
clearly
cover
your
case.
so,
my
question
is,
why
do
you
confine
yourself
to
tort
law
concepts,
as
helpful
as
they
may
be,
as
opposed
to
going
right
to
the
object
of
the
statute
and
saying
injury
should
be
defined
in
terms
of
that
ostensible
object?
unknown
speaker
oh,
you
do.
so,
it
doesn't
have
to
be
person
or
property.
i
mean,
you...
you
feel
free
to
invent
an
object
of
the
statute
beyond
the
words?
i
mean,
it
says
you
have
to
be
injured
in
your
person
or
property.
i
mean,
if
someone
says,
if
you
testify,
i
am
going
to
break
the...
break
the
knees
of
your...
of
your
son-in-law,
would
that
be
covered
by
the
statute?
because,
after
all,
it
would
fit
the
purpose
of
the
statute,
but
are
you
injured
in
your
person
or
property?
unknown
speaker
that's
right.
unknown
speaker
but
i'm
the
one
who...
who's
being
deterred
from
testifying
and
either
i
have
a
cause
of
action
or
nobody
does.
we
don't
rewrite
statutes
up
here,
and...
and
congress,
when
it
writes
a
statute
doesn't...
doesn't
say
whatever
it
takes
to...
to
reach
this
objective.
it
says
we
have
this
objective
and
these
are
the
limits
on
it.
and
they
have
said
here
person
or
property.
i
don't
know
why
you
can
come
up
and
say
anything
that
will...
will
prevent
people
from
being
deterred
from
testifying.
you
must
acknowledge
there
are
some
things
that
will
deter
people
from
testifying
which
are
not
covered
by
this
statute,
like
breaking
the
knees
of
my
son-in-law.
but
if
i
may
interject,
i
think
what
you
were
saying
was
that
anything
that
hurts
the
witness
would
be
covered,
not
that
anything
that
hurts
a
third
party
would
be
covered.
unknown
speaker
my
son-in-law
supports
my
daughter.
i...
i
feel
very
much
hurt
if
my
son-in-law
cannot
have
gainful
employment.
that
doesn't
hurt
me?
it
certainly
does
in
my
person
or
property.
unknown
speaker
mr.
stebbins,
maybe
i
misread
your
position,
but
i
thought
you
were
saying
the
statute
could
just
as
well
have
said
injured,
any
person
who
is
injured,
period.
but
that
in
his
person
or
property
was
an
endeavor
to
show
the
breadth
of
the
statute
rather
than
the
narrowness
of
it.
unknown
speaker
but
then
you
simply
fall
back
on
how
do
you
define
injury.
supposing
that
i'm
in
the
habit
of
inviting
you
to
go
out
to
a
football
game
and
i
have
seats
and
you're
subpoenaed
to
go
before
a
grand
jury
and
i
say,
well,
you
know,
if
you
go
before
that
grand
jury,
i'm
just
going
to
get
somebody
else
to
go
to
the
game
this
time.
now,
that
might
meet
justice
souter's
criteria
of
something
that
would
bother
someone
a
great
deal
and
perhaps
induce
him
not
to
testify,
but
is
that
injury
in
the
light
of
the
statute?
unknown
speaker
would
you
say
that
intentional
infliction
of
emotional
distress
is
injury?
unknown
speaker
if
it's...
if
it's
compensable
under
state
law
as
an
intentional
infliction
of
emotional
distress,
i
assume
it's
injury.
unknown
speaker
is
it
injury
to
person?
unknown
speaker
so,
your
point
is
that...
that
general
concepts
of
tort
law
inform
our
notion
of
injury--
unknown
speaker
--but
the...
but
to...
to
the...
to
the
witness
who
is
the
focus
of
the
statute,
but
they
don't
confine
us
to
particular
categories
of
injury
that
may...
may
or
may
not
be
recognized
in
a
given
state
or
even
a
generality
of
states
at
a
given
time.
is...
is
that
a
fair
summary?
unknown
speaker
but
i...
if
i
may
interrupt
you,
i
thought...
and
maybe...
maybe
i'm
just
not
following
you.
i
thought
you
had
agreed
with
justice
ginsburg
that
the
reference...
in
her
suggestion
that
the
reference
to
person
or
property
is
there
to
indicate
the
breadth
of
the
injuries
that
may
be
the
subject
of
this
statute.
and...
and
in
other
words,
it...
it's...
the
phrase
is
there
to...
to
say
we
cover
the
waterfront,
not
to...
to
indicate
some
constriction.
is...
is
that
correct?
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
you
about
compensable?
if
we
would
go
this
far
with
you
and
say
it's
an
injury,
but
what
would
be
the
measure
of
compensation
given
that
it
was
an
at-will
employment
and
the
employer
could
have
said,
for
any
unpoisoned
reason,
go,
i
don't
like
you.
unknown
speaker
mr.
stebbins,
you're
not
only
assuming
or
asserting
that...
that
injury
to
person
or
property
means
general...
general
tort
law,
but
you're
also
assuming
that
it
means
general
tort
law
as
it
may
evolve
into
the
future.
why
do
you
assume
that?
if...
if,
for
example,
at-will
employment
was
not
considered
or
any
interference
with
at-will
employment
was
not
considered
to
be
a
tort
at
the
time
this
provision
was
adopted,
why...
why
would
i
believe
that
the
congress
which
enacted
this
would
want
that
rather
minor
injury
to
be
sucked
into
the
provision
because
some
future
states
give
causes
of
action
for
interference
with
at-will
employment?
unknown
speaker
very
well,
mr.
stebbins.
mr.
roberts,
we'll
hear
from
you.
unknown
speaker
well,
should
we
look
to
state
law
to
determine
whether
there's
injury
to
person
or
property?
unknown
speaker
why
not?
unknown
speaker
well,
that...
that
covers
this
case.
what
if...
what
if
in
fact
the
only
party
here
were
the
employer?
what
would
the
answer
be
then?
unknown
speaker
but
under...
under
georgia
law
at
the
time
the
statute
was
passed,
the
employer
would...
would
be
scot-free
as
a
matter
of
state
common
law,
i
take
it.
unknown
speaker
but
isn't
there
also
a
question
whether
someone
who
was
incapable
of
committing
the
substantive
offense
can
be
guilty
of
conspiracy
to
commit
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
that
says
if
two
or
more
persons
conspire
to
injure
the
party
in
his
person
or
property.
unknown
speaker
isn't
that
the
relevant
clause
here?
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask?
it's
not
clear
to
me
that
this
kind
of
thing
is
so
obviously
covered.
i
mean,
suppose
my
wife
and
i
have
a...
a
household
retainer,
a
woman
who's
lived
with
us
and
taken
care
of
the
children
and
helped
with
the
housework
and
so
forth,
all
on
an
at-will
basis.
and
this
woman
decides
to
testify
against
us
in
some...
in
some
lawsuit.
you're
asserting
that
my
wife
and
i
couldn't,
feeling
wronged
and
injured
by
that,
decide
to...
that
we
no
longer
wanted
this
woman
to
work
for
us
even
though
she
has
no
contract.
it's
been
just,
you
know,
she
can
leave
whenever
she
wants
and
we
could
fire
her
whenever
she
wants.
unknown
speaker
it
seems
like
a
very
strange
result.
unknown
speaker
that's
sort
of...
that's--
unknown
speaker
--only...
only
if
we
interpret
property
as
broadly
as
you...
as
you
want
us
to
interpret
it,
and
that
situation
makes
me
think
maybe
we
shouldn't
interpret
it
that
broadly
because--
unknown
speaker
--it
seems
an
unreasonable
result.
unknown
speaker
provided
it's
a
conspiracy.
if
the
individual
did
it
to
himself,
it
would
not
be
covered,
would
it?
unknown
speaker
so,
they
have...
both
the
husband
and
wife
have
to
agree
to
do
it.
unknown
speaker
what...
what
about
the
situation
justice
scalia
suggests
where
there's
a
question
you're
injured
in
your
property?
you
say
it's
my
property,
but
someone
else
says,
no,
that's
not
your
property.
it's
a's
property.
unknown
speaker
but
that
doesn't...
you
have
to
go
to
state
law,
don't
you?
unknown
speaker
well,
take--
unknown
speaker
--wait...
wait
a
minute.
i'm
trying
to
ask
you
a
question.
unknown
speaker
if
you'll
simply
slow
down,
maybe
i'll
be
able
to.
unknown
speaker
supposing
that
the
question
is
there's
a
house,
and
i
say
the
house
was
injured,
it
was
mine.
but
someone
else
says,
no,
under
georgia
law
that
house
belonged
to
me.
how
do
you
resolve
that
question?
unknown
speaker
that
was
my
first
question
to
you,
whether
we
look
to
state
law,
and
you
said
no.
and
yet,
if
under
georgia
law
there
is
no
right
whatever
to
maintain
employment,
then
how
could
it
be
a
property
right
as...
as
against
the
employer?
unknown
speaker
we
agree
with
that
that...
i
mean,
let's
assume
we
agree
with
that,
that
it
covers
all
injuries
compensable
under...
under
tort
law.
the
question
is
whose
tort
law.
some
federally-imagined
tort
law
or...
or
state
tort
law?
i
mean,
that's--
unknown
speaker
--of
course,
if
you
don't
own
the
house,
it's
not
going
to
be
compensable
in
anybody's
tort
law.
there's
no
injury
if
you
don't
own
the
house.
unknown
speaker
unless
you
create
a
federal
law
of
property,
just
as
you
want
us
to
create
a
federal
law
of
torts.
if
you
can
do
the
one,
why
can't
you
do
the
other?
you
don't
have
a
federal
law
to
own
other
people's
houses.
suppose...
suppose...
this
might
help.
suppose
georgia
made
it
quite
clear
that
there
was
no
tort
for
interference
with
an
advantageous
business
relation
where
you
destroy
an
at-will
employment
relation.
what
then
would
be
the
answer
in
this
case?
unknown
speaker
because?
unknown
speaker
in
the
hypothetical
that
i
gave,
no
tort
in
georgia
for
interference
with
that
advantageous
business
right,
what
is
the
property
that's
been
injured
in
that
instance?
unknown
speaker
thank
you,
mr.
roberts.
we'll
hear
now
from
you,
mr.
bradley.
unknown
speaker
may
i
just--
--mr.
bradley,
do
i
understand
from
what
you
just
said
that,
to
take
the
clearest
case,
the
at-will
employer
says
to
employee,
there's
a
federal
investigation
going
on.
don't
you
dare
testify.
if
you
do,
you
will
be
fired
at
once.
that's
our
case.
and
you
would
say
that
this
statute
does
not
provide
a
remedy.
let's
say
that
the
employee
testifies
and
is
fired
at
once.
unknown
speaker
does
not,
yes.
unknown
speaker
and
i
assume
you
would
say
this
statute
also
doesn't
provide
a
remedy
if
he...
if
you
say
to
this
person
not
that
i
will
fire
you,
but
i
will
break
your
son-in-law's
knees.
that
also
wouldn't
be
covered,
would
it?
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
you
just
a
question
of
georgia
tort
law?
i
assume
that
if
i
run
over
an
at-will
employee
with
my
car
or
if
justice
scalia
does--
[laughter]
--that--
--gratuitous.
gratuitous.
--that
the
at-will...
that
the
at-will
employee
can
recover
damages
for...
for
lost
wages.
unknown
speaker
well,
but
from
that,
it
also
necessarily
followed
that
the
property
interest
in
continued
employment
was
also...
was
also
injured.
unknown
speaker
we...
we
say...
i
mean,
you're
quite
right.
in
our
usual
vocabulary
we
say,
well,
lost
wages
is
an
element
of
damage
or
damages,
but
the
reason
it's
an
element
of
damages
is
that
there
is
a
property
interest
which
in
fact
has...
has
been
diminished
as
a
consequence
of
the
personal
injury.
so,
it's...
i...
i
don't
see
how
you
can
avoid
the
conclusion
that
there
is
a
property
interest
recognized
in
the
damages
remedy.
unknown
speaker
well,
it
wouldn't
the
way
the
law
of
any
state
is...
is
structured
today,
but
i...
it's...
it...
there
would
be
a
lot
of
foolishness
but
no
illogic,
i
suppose,
in
a
state's
coming
along
and
saying,
we
aren't
going
to
have
any
more
recovery
for
pain
and
suffering,
but
we
are
going
to
have
recovery
for
economic
damages
in
automobile
accident
cases.
and
you
would
end
up
with
the
same
kind
of
recovery
that
you
get
as
an
element
of
damage
in
the...
in
the
case...
in
the
scheme
that
we
all
have
now.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
presume
you
would
have
a...
if
you
were...
if
you
were
still
injured,
i
presume
you
would
have
a
recovery
for
future
earnings.
unknown
speaker
oh,
sure.
you
would...
you
would
have
to
prove
the...
the
likelihood
of
continued
employment,
even
though
it
was
at
will.
but
the
fact
that
it
was
at
will
would
not
preclude
your
proving
the
likelihood
of
continued
employment.
unknown
speaker
okay.
i
presume
that
if
i
struck
your
colleague
in...
in
the
way
that
has
been
fancifully
hypothesized
and...
while
he
was
on
his...
on
his
way
to
his
wedding
and...
as
a
result
of
which,
he
missed
the
wedding,
and...
and
the
young
woman
in
question
reconsidered
the
whole
thing
and
refused
to
marry
him,
he
might
have
a
cause
of
action
against
me,
might
he
not?
and
would
you
say
that
he
had
a
property
interest
in
his
wedding?
unknown
speaker
would
justice
souter,
do
you
think?
may
i
ask
you
a
question?
it
sounds
like
a
valuable--
--assume
you--
[laughter]
assume
you
do
have
a
contract
right
to
employment.
say
this
had
happened
to
a
person
who
had
a
3-year
contract
to
employment,
and
therefore
would
have
had
a
damage
remedy
under
state
law
for
breach
of
contract
when
he
was
discharged.
is
it
your
view
that
the
remedy
provided
by
the
federal
statute
is
coextensive
what
would
otherwise
be
just
a
state
law
remedy
for
either
a
tort
or
a
breach
of
contract?
or
does
the
state...
does
the
federal
law
give
the
plaintiff
anything
extra?
unknown
speaker
can
you
give
me
a
case
in
which
the
federal
remedy
gives
you
something
more
than
you
can
get
at
state
law
for
a
victim
of
this
kind
of
conspiracy?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
and
can
you
also
answer
another
question
for
me?
do
you
think
the
word
property
in
this
statute
has
the
same
or
a
different
meaning
from
the
word
property
in
section
7
of
the
sherman
act,
which
was
enacted
in
the
19th
century
also?
unknown
speaker
i'm
just
asking,
do
you
think
it
has
the
same
or
a
different
meaning?
unknown
speaker
i'm
not
asking
you
about
the
sonotone
case.
i'm
familiar
with
the
case.
i'm
just
asking
you
if
you
think
the
word
property
has
a
significantly
different
meaning
in
section
7
of
the
sherman
act
and
in
this
statute,
and
if
so,
what's
the
difference?
unknown
speaker
of
course,
that
refers
to...
to
the
constitutional
protection
against
deprivations
of
property,
and
this
is
a
statutory
remedy
for
injuries.
the
word
injury
is
quite
different
from
the
word
deprivation.
unknown
speaker
but
those
two
things
are
totally
different,
aren't
they?
the
sherman
act
and
the
fourteenth
amendment
protects
property
where
property
is
defined
as
those
things
that
people
rely
upon
keeping
in
their
ordinary
lives.
hence,
we
look
to
state
law
and
distinguish
between
probationary
teachers
and
permanent
teachers
and
so
forth.
now,
here
the
sherman
act
doesn't
do
that,
does
it?
unknown
speaker
all
right.
so...
so,
here
we
don't
have
that.
i
concede
that,
i
think.
but
we
do
have
here
an
expectation
of
money,
don't
we?
we
have
that.
i
mean,
i
want
to
go
element
by
element.
there's
an
expectation
of
money.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
correct.
there's--
unknown
speaker
--no,
no.
well,
isn't
it...
don't
you
expect...
i'm
not
talking
legally,
i'm
talking
in
human
terms...
that
an
executive
of
a
company
expects
to
be
there
next
month
and
to
render
services
and
to
get
paid?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
would
say
he
expects
it.
i
mean,
don't
you
think
in
90
percent...
i'm
talking
in
human
terms.
i
mean,
i
don't
know
if
you...
all
right.
you
don't
want
to
go
that
far.
you
don't
have
to.
i
guess
it
depends
upon
whether
it's
a
reasonable
expectation
that
society
is
prepared
to
consider
as
legitimate.
yes,
that's--
--to
quote
a
whole
other
line
of
cases.
but
anyway,
that
expectation
is
protected
by
state
law,
isn't
it?
at
least
protected
against
interference
by
a
third
person.
i
mean,
there
are
standing
cases
where
standing
is
premised
on
a
person's
expectation
protected
by
state
law
that
his
contract
or...
will
not
be
interfered
with
or
a
business
relationship
won't
be
interfered
with
or
a
future
contract
not
entered
into
yet
that
possibly
will
come
about
as
a
result
of
this
negotiation.
all
of
those
things
are
protected
often
by
state
law,
and
i
assume
georgia
is
the
same,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
all
right.
so,
we
have
a
protection,
at
least
against
third
parties.
we
have
an
expectation,
and
we
also
have
the
fact
that
it
is
an
element
in
many
ordinary
tort
suits.
so,
my
question...
an
element
of
damages.
so,
where
you
have
those
three
things,
why
isn't
it
property
for
purposes
of
this
statute?
unknown
speaker
but
that
was
a
constitutional
deprivation,
and
i
thought
justice
breyer
started
out
by
saying
those
cases
are
not
what's
involved
here.
we're
not
talking
about
deprivation
of
constitutionally
protected
property.
unknown
speaker
mr.--
unknown
speaker
--you're
right.
i--
--mr.
bradley,
i
think
we
are
less
concerned...
or
at
least
i
am.
i'm...
i'm
not
sure
we
have
before
us
the
question
of
what
property
means.
i
think
what
we
have
before
us
more
precisely
is
what
the
phrase
injury
to
person
or
property
means,
and...
and
what
other...
what
other
statutes
use
precisely
that
phrase
and
have
been
interpreted
in
a
way
favorable
to
you?
i
mean,
property
in
isolation
is
something
different,
but
somehow
the
phrase
injury
to
person
or
property
means
all
sorts
of
injury,
whatever
injury,
whether
it's,
you
know...
that's
the
argument
made
by
the
petitioner
here,
and
i...
and
i
think
there's
something
to
it.
do
you
have
other
statutes
that
use
precisely
that
phrase,
injury
to
person
or
property?
unknown
speaker
before
you
do
that,
could
you
just
clarify
the
answer
to
my...
to
what
i
had
asked?
i
take
it
from
your
answer
to
my
question
that
you
say
the
word
property
here
does
mean
what
the
fourteenth
amendment
provides,
in
which
case
your
answer
to
justice
stevens
is
it's
totally
different.
i
mean,
i
take
it
that...
i
have...
i
set
one
position.
the
opposite
position
has
the
same
meaning
as
the
fourteenth
amendment
has,
which
i
take
it
is
your
position,
and
i
want
to
be
sure
there
isn't
some
fall-back
position
you
have
between
those
two.
i
mean,
if...
you're
right,
in
my
opinion,
if
the
word
property
means
the
same
as
what
it
means
in
the
fourteenth
amendment.
so...
so,
i'm
not
going
to
argue
that
one
with
you.
i
just
want
to
be
sure
that
that
is
your
argument,
and
you
don't
have
some
other
argument
that
i'm
missing.
unknown
speaker
if...
on...
on
that
point,
assuming
that
in
fact
there...
there
may
be
an
overriding
objective
here
to
prevent
people
from
being
coerced
against
testifying
or
retaliated
against
for
testifying
by
conspiracies
of
people
who
are
mad
about
their
testifying,
why
would
congress,
in
enacting
this
statute,
have
wanted
to
leave
a
whole
classification
of
injuries
which
in
justice
breyer's
sense
in
human
terms
are
injuries
to
the
witness
from
coverage
of
the
statute?
because
that
seems
to
be
the
consequence
of
your
position.
if
i...
if
i
run
over
the
person
with
my
car
or
if
i...
if
i
get
you
fired
from
your
at-will
job
by
saying
to
your
employer
or
two
of...
two
people
get
you
fired
by...
by
saying,
you
know,
bradley
is
an
embezzler,
you
ought
to
let
him
go,
under
straight
georgia
law,
there's
going
to
be
compensation
for
the
employee.
so,
there's
a...
there's
a
good
common-sense
understanding
that
the
employee
gets
hurt
and
gets
hurt
in
the
pocketbook
which
is
a
property
kind
of
hurt.
why
would
congress,
in...
in
wanting
to
preserve
the
integrity
of
the
federal
courts
by
protecting
witnesses,
want
to
leave
that
loophole?
unknown
speaker
okay,
but
what's
the
answer
to
my
question?
assuming
that
there
is
this
sphere
of
genuine
harm
to
the
witness
or
potential
witness,
why
would
congress
want
to
have
left
that
sphere
totally
uncovered
by
the
statute?
unknown
speaker
but
do
you...
do
you...
do
you
dispute
the
fact
that
there...
there
certainly
would
be
a
very
potent
way
to
coerce
or
retaliate
by
ending
or
by
causing
a
third
party
to
end
at-will
employment,
and
yet
that...
that
particular
subject
would
be
uncovered
by
the
statute?
do
you
agree
to
that
extent--
unknown
speaker
--with
the
premise
of
my
question?
unknown
speaker
well,
yes
or
no.
do
you
agree
with
the
premise
of
my
question?
unknown
speaker
so,
he
doesn't
care
whether
he
gets
fired
or
not
because
he
can
leave.
the
fact
that
he
may
want
to
stay
and
spend
his
life
in
a
particular
job
is
of
no
consequence
because
in
fact,
if
he
should
change
his
mind,
he
can
leave
and
get
another
job
tomorrow.
is...
is
that
your
reasoning?
unknown
speaker
i...
i
thought
your
point
was
that
there
are
a
lot
of
things
not
covered.
i...
i
could
say
if
you
testify,
i
will
not
remember
you
in
my
will.
that
doesn't
appear
to
be...
to
be
covered
either.
unknown
speaker
but
your
point
is
not
only
are
there
a
lot
of
things
covered,
but
nothing
is
covered
except
where
there's
already
a
remedy
under
state
law.
that's
your
real
position.
unknown
speaker
and
it's
either
a
breach
of
contract
or
a
tort.
so,
there's
always
recovery
under
state
law.
so,
the
statute
is
totally
meaningless.
unknown
speaker
well,
the
statute
didn't
trust
state
law.
it
gave
a
federal
cause
of
action
because
it
didn't
trust
state
courts
and
state
law.
and...
and
what
the
statute
says
is
you
have
a
federal
cause
of
action.
if
there's
a
right
under
state
law,
we
will
enforce
it.
what
they
were
worried
about
was
the
enforcement
of
state
laws
against...
against
the
ku
klux
klan
in
particular.
unknown
speaker
where
is
this?
unknown
speaker
okay.
unknown
speaker
what
page
are
you
reading
from?
unknown
speaker
thank
you.
unknown
speaker
you
know,
the
language
you
quote
and
it's
true
of
all
the
subsections...
emphasized
the
fact
that
in
each
of
these
cases,
there's
a
federal
wrong.
so,
the
statute
was
not
merely
intended
to
provide
a
federal
remedy
for
pre-existing
state
wrongs,
was
it?
unknown
speaker
of
course,
you
agree
that...
you
would
agree
they...
they
would
have
a
prima
facie
case
if
they
had
term
contracts.
right?
unknown
speaker
so,
that...
that
horrible
can...
can
happen
in...
in
another
context
anyway.
unknown
speaker
and
of
course,
the
other
side
of
the
coin
too
is
that
under
your
reading
of
the
statute,
they
could
just
put
a
bulletin
out
and
say
anybody
who
goes
to
testify
before
the
grand
jury
truthfully
gets...
gets
canned.
unknown
speaker
we
talked
about
criminal
statutes.
the
criminal
statutes.
what
civil
remedy
is
there
for
someone
who...
take
the
case
that
you
were
candid
to
say,
yes,
that's
what
i'm
talking
about.
you
testify
before
that
grand
jury,
you're
fired.
unknown
speaker
it's
a
criminal
statute.
unknown
speaker
go
a
little
slower
over
that.
what
is
the
remedy?
whose
remedy
is
it?
unknown
speaker
yes,
injunctive
relief
for
the
government.
what
remedy
is
there
for
a
mr.
haddle?
unknown
speaker
and
what
does
that
provide?
unknown
speaker
that...
that
covers
witnesses?
unknown
speaker
was
there
some
impediment?
i
know
there
was
another
person
who
was
mentioned
in
this
picture,
somebody
named
neal.
unknown
speaker
o'neal?
yes.
unknown
speaker
and
that...
and
that
failed
i
think.
unknown
speaker
is
the
difference
attorney's
fees?
unknown
speaker
can
he
get
attorney's
fees
here
and
he
can't
get
it
under
the...
under
the
other
act?
unknown
speaker
under
both?
unknown
speaker
thank
you,
mr.
bradley.
mr.
stebbins,
you
have
2
minutes
remaining.
