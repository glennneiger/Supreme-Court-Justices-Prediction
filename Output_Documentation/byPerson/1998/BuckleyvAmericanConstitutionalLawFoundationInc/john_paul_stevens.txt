well,
do
you
think
registered
voters
are
more
apt
to
leave
the
state
than
people
who
haven't
registered?
i
mean,
are
less
apt
to
leave
the
state
than
people
who
haven't
registered?
is
there
any
statistic
to
show
which
ones,
which
segment
of
the
population
is
more
mobile
than
the
other?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
don't
they
have
to
provide
you
with
their...
you
could
require
them
to
provide
you
with
their
name
and
address
so
that
even
though
they're
itinerant
you
can
still...
you
know,
you
can
find
who
they
were.
justice
john
paul
stevens
have
you
ever
prosecuted
any
petition
gatherer?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
o'toole,
may
i
ask
you
a
factual
question
about
a--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--colorado
law?
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
provision
being
challenged
here,
such
as
a
requirement
to
wear
a
badge--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--do
they
apply
to
candidate
solicitation?
i
mean,
solicitation
of
signatures
for
a
candidate,
and
to
get
a
candidate's
name
on
the
ballot?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
do
you
mean,
it
may
but
it
doesn't?
either
it
does
or
it
doesn't.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
no,
no.
i
said,
as
a
matter--
i'm
asking
you
what
the
colorado
law
is.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
the
issue--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--so
if
we
uphold
this...
the
judgment
that
we're
reviewing,
that
will
have
no
impact
one
way
or
another
on
any
existing
colorado
law
applying
to
the
solicitation
of
names
to
put
a
candidate's
name
on
the
ballot.
justice
john
paul
stevens
--mr.
o'toole,
may
i
ask
you
another
question
about
the
state
of
the
record?
the
state...
one
of
the
important
state
interests
here
is
to
catch
the
people
who
are
bribing
people
to
sign
petitions,
and
there's
sort
of
a
presumption
that
paid
circulators
may
do
that
rather
often.
does
the
record
contain
any
evidence
indicating
how...
what
percentage
of
paid
circulators
engage
in
this
kind
of
conduct
and
what
percentage
don't?
i
mean,
normally
we
presume
people
are
innocent
until
they're
proved
guilty,
but
here
there's
kind
of
a
presumption
that
paid
circulators
are
guilty
of
this
recurring
crime.
justice
john
paul
stevens
does
the
evidence
support
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
i'm
not
asking
what
you
argued
in
the
brief.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i'm
asking
you
what's
in
the...
what
evidence
was
adduced
in
the
trial
court,
and
what
findings,
if
any,
were
made?
justice
john
paul
stevens
does
that
indicate
how
many
people
were
responsible
for
those
fraudulent
signatures?
