why
isn't
that--
justice
david
h.
souter
how
do
you
get
around
the
fact
that,
despite
the
complexity
of
function,
and
i
will
concede
to
you
that
they
are
performing
functions
in
the
electoral
process,
how
do
you
get
around
the
fact
that
meyer
says
they're
also
engaging
in
core
speech,
and
if
they're
engaging
in
core
speech,
they're
going
to
be...
your
restrictions
are
going
to
be
judged
on
a
very
restrictive
standard.
how
do
you
get
around
meyer
in
that
respect?
justice
david
h.
souter
i'll
grant
you
it
would
be
easier
if
you
didn't
have
to
go
to
california,
but
i
mean,
if
the
fraud
is
serious
you
can
start
an
extradition
proceeding,
can't
you?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
why,
because
it
cost
too
much
money?
justice
david
h.
souter
--sign
this
petition
to
lower
taxes,
meaningful
speech
again?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
does
the
evidence
show
how
many
of
those
who
did
perpetrate
fraud
were
paid
and
how
many
were
unpaid?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
then
you're
saying
there
was
evidence
that
they
had
committed
fraud.
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
now,
what
evidence
was
there
that
unpaid
solicitors
had
committed
comparable
fraud?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
