justice
antonin
scalia
it
would
also
show
the
amounts
that
went
to
the
individual
petition
circulators?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
there's
this
difference
between
signature
gathering
and
a
primary
election.
in
a
primary
election
it
is
not
somebody
trying
to
persuade
somebody
else.
signature
gathering
may
perform
that
function,
but
it
is,
in
addition,
and
perhaps
primarily,
one
citizen
trying
to
persuade
another
citizen
about
the
merits
of
a
particular
legislature
proposal.
justice
antonin
scalia
well--
justice
antonin
scalia
why
is
that?
let's
talk
about...
why
is
it
easier
to
prevent
fraud
somehow
when
you're
dealing
with
a
resident
than
with
a
nonresident?
you
think
coloradans
are
more
honest
than
non
coloradans?
[laughter]
is
that
the
rationale?
justice
antonin
scalia
were
these
gatherers
or
signers?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
the
only
justification
for
the
registration
requirement
you've
given
us
is
that
it's
easier
to
find
their
address
if
they're
registered.
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
you
can
require
that
they
be
residents
without
requiring
that
they
be
registered
voters.
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
a
resident,
and
this
is
my
address.
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
how
many
of
these
people
are
we
talking
about?
how
much
of
a
burden
is
that
on
the
state
that
you
save
by
simply
going
to
the
registration
book?
does
the
state
do
that,
go
to
the
registration
rolls
and
check
that
all
these
people
are
actually
registered?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
how
many
people
are
you
talking...
how
many
of
these
election
gypsies
are
there
who
wander
around
from
state
to
state?
justice
antonin
scalia
several
hundreds?
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
not
a
whole
lot
of
people.
justice
antonin
scalia
has
this
been
a
problem?
has
this--
justice
antonin
scalia
--how
often,
of
paying
people
to
sign
petitions?
justice
antonin
scalia
how
often?
how
many
prosecutions
have
there
been
of
this
sort?
justice
antonin
scalia
have
there
been
any
prosecutions,
recent
or
otherwise?
justice
antonin
scalia
are
you
this
careful
in
registering
voters,
as
opposed
to
collecting
petitions
that
would
undo
the
work
of
the
legislature?
you
see,
i
come
into
this
with
the
attitude
that
legislatures
don't
like
these
things,
because
they're
usually
collected
in
order
to
do
something
that
the
legislature
doesn't
want
it
to,
or
to
undo
something
that
the
legislature
has
done.
now,
has
your
legislature
been
this
concerned
about
the
slightest
chance
of
fraud
with
respect
to,
let
us
say,
registering
to
vote?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
see.
but
you
used
to
be
this
careful
before
the
drive
through
registration
laws.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
thought
you
would
say
meyer
v.
grant
immediately,
because
that
also
involves
exactly
the
same
two
things
that
are
involved
here.
it
involved
the
persuasive
function
and
the--
justice
antonin
scalia
--what
we
call
the
administrative
function.
justice
antonin
scalia
excuse
me.
what
do
you
mean
by
meaningful
speech?
could
you
define
this
term?
if
i
come
up
to
you
and
say,
vote
for
smith,
or
i
have
a
sign
that
says,
vote
for
smith,
is
that
meaningful
speech,
or
do
i
have
to
tell
you
why?
justice
antonin
scalia
core
political
speech,
isn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
would
you
sign
this
petition?
justice
antonin
scalia
is
not--
justice
antonin
scalia
and
identification
as
a
paid
solicitor?
wasn't
that
stricken
out?
do
they
have
to
identify
themselves
as
paid
solicitors?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
was
also--
justice
antonin
scalia
you
think
it
takes
fortification?
we
couldn't
just
apply
meyer.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
think
if
we
just
applied
meyer,
you
lose?
justice
antonin
scalia
why
do
you
say--
justice
antonin
scalia
--why
do
you
insist
on
making
your
case
harder?
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
it
seems
to
me
it's
quite
a
different
issue
how
many
votes
you
need
to
get.
that
doesn't
involve
core
political
speech.
we're
talking
about
persuading
people
to
sign,
as
opposed
to
how
many
people
need
to
sign,
and
you
think
the
two
questions
have
to
be
equated.
justice
antonin
scalia
that
is
very
different.
i
would
think
one
goes
to
the
procedure
involved
in
making
this
change,
and
the
other
goes
to
the
question
of
one
citizen
trying
to
get
another
one
to
sign
up
or
to
support
a
particular
proposition.
you
don't
see
a
fundamental
difference
between
those
two?
justice
antonin
scalia
--it's
hard
to
see
that
there's
a
compelling
state
interest
in
having
this
information
if
the
state
doesn't
require
it
for
these
other
matters,
isn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
thought
you
had
no
objection
to
applying
to
your
situation
what
justice
breyer
is
worried
about
applying
to
contributors.
you
have
no
objection--
justice
antonin
scalia
--to
disclosing--
justice
antonin
scalia
--who
the
circulators
are
and
that
they're
paid
and
how
much
money
is
paid,
and
all
of
that
is,
indeed,
disclosed,
isn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
what
justice
breyer
should
be
asking
you
is,
what
if
we
required
contributors
to
candidates
to
go
around
wearing
a
button
that
says,
contributor
to
candidate?
that's
the
parallel,
isn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
you're
not
appealing
that
here.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
for
present
purposes--
justice
antonin
scalia
--why
don't
you
be
magnanimous
and
say,
we
accept
all
of
that?
you
don't
even
mind
having
the
individual
circulators
identified
in
the
affidavit
that's
filed
at
the
end,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
could
you--
justice
antonin
scalia
--could
you
require
a
statement
on
a
candidate
petition
that
says
at
the
top,
circulated
by
someone
who
expects
a
job--
[laughter]
--from
this
candidate
if
he
is
elected?
could
you
require
that
statement?
that's
very
important
information
for
the
voter
to
know.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
not
require
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
--do
these
circulators
get...
they
get
paid
by
the
name,
is
that--
justice
antonin
scalia
--so
when
they
forge
a
name
they
are
cheating
not
just
the
state,
they're
cheating
the
person
who
hired
them.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
i
assume
he
would
have
an
interest
in
preventing
their
fraud
as
well.
justice
antonin
scalia
--i
thought
there
was
a
breakdown.
i
asked
that
question
earlier.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
thought
it
did
identify
how
much
was
paid
to
each
petition
circulator,
did
it
not?
justice
antonin
scalia
no--
justice
antonin
scalia
--right.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
is
stated
about
the
expenditures,
so
much...
i
expended
so
much
for
television--
justice
antonin
scalia
--so
much
for
radio--
justice
antonin
scalia
--okay.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
have
to
show
who
the
money
was
paid
to.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
if
it's
paid
to
circulators,
don't
you
have
to
show
the
circulator
and
how
much
money
was
paid
to
each
circulator?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
see.
you
pay
the
national
company
that
hires
these
circulators,
is
that
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
you
only
have
to
show
what
company
you
paid
it
to,
and
these
are
employees
of
that
company.
