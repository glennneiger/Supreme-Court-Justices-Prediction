chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
number
97-930,
victoria
buckley
v.
the
american
constitutional
law
foundation.
general
norton.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
do...
is
there
any
way
of
telling
from
this
record
whether
the
typical
petitioner
circulator
goes
door
to
door,
or
sits
in
a
shopping
mall?
i
suppose
they
do
both.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
so--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--isn't
there
something
in
the
record
that
suggests
that
it's
easier
to
determine
whether
someone
is
a
registered
voter
than
it
is
to
determine
whether
they're
a
resident?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
you
also--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--you
also
said,
i
think,
it
was
much
easier
for
the
state
to
determine
whether
someone
was
actually
a
registered
voter
or
not
than
to
determine
whether
they're
actually
a
resident.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
much
do
we
actually
know
about
this,
or
how
much
did
we
know
about
it
in
meyer?
you
know,
if,
in
fact,
someone
sits
at
a
shopping
center
and
waits
for
people
to
come
up
to
them,
and
they're
anxious
to
get
as
many
signatures
as
they
can,
one
would
suspect
that
there's
not
much
debate.
if
someone
is
going
to
say,
i
don't
like
that
proposition,
the
petition
circulator
just
says,
okay,
go
on.
i
want
someone
who
will
sign.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
general
norton,
justice
o'connor
asked
you
a
question.
she
said,
if
you
are
to
prevail
here,
do
we
have
to
modify
or
clarify
meyer,
and
you
refer
to
burdick.
what's
your
answer
to
her
question?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
i
don't
think
strict
scrutiny
was
applied
across
the
board
in
buckley,
general
norton.
i
mean,
there
were
several
different
kinds
of
requirements
there,
and
i
would...
perhaps
you've
read
it
more
recently
than
we
have.
i
would
not
have
said
that
strict
scrutiny
was
applied
across
the
board.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
general
norton.
mr.
o'toole.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
meyer
was
different
factually
in
a
way.
i
think
you
can
look
at
meyer
as
an
offspring,
kind
of,
of
the
buckley
case,
that
just
as
you
can't
tell
someone
they
can't
spend
their
own
money
to
finance
their
campaign,
you
can't
tell
someone
that
they
can't
hire
petitioners
to...
hire
circulators
to
go
around
and
circulate
something.
but
this
goes
beyond
whether
or
not
you
can
hire
petitioners
or
not,
or
circulators.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
think
the
facts
of
this
case
are
the
same
as
meyer?
that's...
i'm
telling
you
the
facts
are
different.
now,
you
disagree?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i'm
talking
about
the
facts.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
meyer
was...
as
i
recall
was
paid
circulators,
and
here
we're
talking
about
different
requirements.
we're
not
talking
about--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--really
a
prohibition
against
paid
circulators.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--what
about
the
requirement
in
most
states
that
there's
certain
qualifications
for
circulating
nominating
petitions.
there's
the
person
who
goes
door
to
door,
and
you
have
to
have
so
many
signatures
to
get
on
the
ballot.
now,
is
that
circulator
engaging
in
core
political
speech,
in
your
view?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--you
know...
so
the
person
in
the
shopping
center
collecting
signatures
says,
vote
for
this
anti
tax
referendum.
the
person
coming
to
the
door
with
a
signature
sheet
for
nominations
says,
will
you
sign
this
nominating
petition
for
joe
blow?
those
are
pretty
much
the
same,
aren't
they?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
let's
analyze
the
thing
without
necess...
without
any--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--more
on
a
factual
basis.
what
is
the
difference
factually
in
terms
of
core
political
speech
between
a
person
who
comes
to
the
door
with
a
nominating
petition
and
says,
will
you
please
sign
this
nominating
commission
for
joe
blow...
petition,
and
the
person
who
sits
in
the
shopping
center
and
says,
will
you
please
sign
this
referendum
for
antitax?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
in
a
sense
any
regulations
may
hinder
the
process.
probably
the
least
hindering
would
be
no
regulation
at
all,
but
you
don't
contend
that
the
state
can't
regulate
it
at
all.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that's
a
tough
one.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
they
forged
names,
i
guess--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--rather
than
writing
in
the
identity
of
individuals.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--thank
you,
mr.
o'toole.
general
gale,
you
have
1
minute
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
general
norton.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
case
is
submitted.
