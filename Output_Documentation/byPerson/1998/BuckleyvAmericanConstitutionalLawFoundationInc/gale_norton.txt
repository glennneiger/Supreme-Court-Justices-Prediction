ms.

mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
colorado
views
the
initiative
process
as
an
essential
part
of
our
law
making
function.
the
right
of
initiative
is
the
first
section
under
the
colorado
constitution
under
the
heading,
legislative
department.
because
this
is
an
important
process
to
state
government
we
have
established
a
limited
structure
of
regulation
intended
to
safeguard
the
people's
right
to
democratic
self
government
while
ensuring
the
fairness
of
our
election
process.
beyond
the
two
viewpoints
represented
in
the
courtroom
today,
there
are
two
other
important
interests
that
are
protected
through
our
regulatory
process.
the
first
is
the
interest
of
those
who
may
oppose
an
initiative,
and
the
second
is
the
interest
of
the
signers
of
the
petition.
ms.
gale
norton
yes,
sir.
ms.
gale
norton
that
is
correct.
it
is
the
reports
that
deal
with
the
monthly
reporting
requirement
as
to
the
individual
petition
circulators.
ms.
gale
norton
the
final
report
would
list
all
of
the
expenditures
included
among
the
expenditures
of
the
sponsoring
campaign
committee--
ms.
gale
norton
--it
is
separated
out
in
detail.
ms.
gale
norton
i'm
not
sure,
your
honor.
ms.
gale
norton
that
is
correct.
ms.
gale
norton
the
monthly
reports
are
while
it
is
in
circulation.
ms.
gale
norton
your
honor,
i'm
not
sure
what
the
due
date
is
for
the
final
report.
ms.
gale
norton
the
monthly
disclosure
statement
lists
the
amounts
that
are
paid
to
each
individual
circulator
on
a
person
by
person
basis.
ms.
gale
norton
the--
ms.
gale
norton
--what
has
been
struck
down
is
simply
the
amount
that
applies
to
individual
circulators.
ms.
gale
norton
yes.
ms.
gale
norton
you
would
have
to
add
up
the
amount
that
is
paid
to
each
individual
circulator.
ms.
gale
norton
signature
gathering
serves
the
same
function
as
a
primary
election
in
a
candidate
selection
process.
by
obtaining
the
requisite
54,242
signatures,
an
initiative's
backers
establish
that
it
has
a
significant
modicum
of
support.
ms.
gale
norton
here,
there
are
three
functions
that
all
occur
simultaneously.
that
is
the
aspect
of
persuasiveness,
as
you
have
described.
there
is
also
a
role
that
the
circulator
plays
of
an
administrative
function
akin
to
an
election
judge,
and
there
is
also
the
function
of
acting
as
an
agent
or
fiduciary
for
the
signer
in
fulfilling
responsibilities
as
to
the
signer.
ms.
gale
norton
they
may
do
both.
the
practice
is
ordinarily
to
go
to
a
shopping
mall
or
some
place
where
there
are
many
people
gathered.
the--
ms.
gale
norton
--record
does
not
specifically
describe
that
in
the
trial
court.
ms.
gale
norton
that
is
two
part.
first
of
all,
is
because
they
are
fulfilling
a
law
making
function,
we
as
a
state
should
be
able
to
say
that
those
who
are
fulfilling
that
function
should
be
people
who
are
committed
to--
ms.
gale
norton
--we
are
happy
to
have
people
debate
the
merits
and
to
enter
into
a
persuasive
function.
it
is
only
when
they
perform
the
administrative
election
judge
type
functions
of
ensuring
that
those
who
are
signing
the
petition
are
who
they
say
they
are,
that
a
husband
is
not
signing
for
a
wife--
ms.
gale
norton
--the
registration
requirement
is
different
from
a
residency
requirement
in
that
it
requires
a
person
to
swear
an
oath
that
they
are
a
resident
of
the
state
before
they
begin
the
circulating
process.
there
is
a
requirement
that
they
do
so
at
the
end
of
the
circulating
process
as
part
of
the
affidavit
if
registration
and
residency
are
separated.
but
here,
we
have
an
assurance
all
the
way
through
the
process
that
they're
going
to
be
here.
it
ties
in
with
the
second
justification
for
that,
and
that
is
in
preventing
fraud.
we
have
had
the
problem
of
people
who
come
to
the
state
simply
to
circulate
petitions.
if
those
people
are
not
going
to
be
around
several
months
later
when
we
actually
go
through
the
process
of
having
an
administrative
hearing
to--
ms.
gale
norton
--that
is
ordinarily
our
process--
ms.
gale
norton
--this
would
ensure
that
they
are
a
resident
throughout
the
entire
time
that
they
are
circulating
the
petition,
rather
than
just
at
the
moment
they
submit--
ms.
gale
norton
--we
have
specific
lists
of
registered
voters.
we
do
not
have
lists
of
people
who
are
otherwise
residents.
it
gives
us
a
concrete
place
to
answer
that
question.
ms.
gale
norton
it
is
a
way
of
verifying
that
a
person
is,
indeed,
a
resident,
and
that
is
correct,
but
it
is
also...
there's
also
two
parts.
to
the
extent
that
someone
is
playing
a
formal
role
in
the
process,
which
they
are
doing,
we
would
require
that
they
be
registered
voters
in
a
way
as
part
of
being
committed
to
the
colorado
law
making
process,
just
as
we
require
our
legislators
to
be
committed,
just
as
we
require
election
judges
and
those
who
participate
in
nominating
conventions
to
be
registered
voters.
if
they
want
to
participate
in
the
purely
advocacy
function,
to
stand
next
to
someone
who
is
a
registered
voter,
they
are
perfectly
free
to
do
that
and
to
act
as
advocates.
ms.
gale
norton
we
believe
that,
even
under
a
strict
scrutiny
analysis,
that
our
laws
would
satisfy
that
strict
scrutiny.
ms.
gale
norton
well,
we
would
like
to
think
so.
our
rationale
is
being
able
to
find
people.
if
someone
is
a
registered
voter,
they
have
taken
an
oath
saying
that
they
are
a
resident.
that
gives
us
some
assurance
that
they
may
be
around
when
questions
arise.
someone
may
seek
a
signature.
it
may
be
6
months
later,
at
the
time
an
administrative
hearing
is
held
to
inquire
into
questions
abut
the
validity
of
that
signature,
and
if
those
people
have
left
the
state,
we
cannot
subpoena--
ms.
gale
norton
--to
the
extent
that
we
are
dealing
with
the
problem
of...
that
is
described
in
the
amicus
briefs
of
the
state
and
local
legal
center
and
of
the
states,
we
are
seeing
the
development
of
bands
of
people
who
go
from
state
to
state
simply
to
circulate
petitions,
and--
ms.
gale
norton
--we
may
know
that
they
live
in
california,
but
we
cannot
subpoena
them
in
california
and
we
cannot
prosecute
them
for
having
engaged
in
fraud.
ms.
gale
norton
yes,
we
have.
in
the
record
it
shows
the
1992
cycle,
in
which
we
successfully
prosecuted
three
people
for
forgery.
we
attempted
to
prosecute
three
others,
but
were
not
able
to
serve
the
warrant
because
they
had
left
the
state.
ms.
gale
norton
these
were
gatherers.
ms.
gale
norton
we
were
not
able
to,
as
a
practical
matter,
do
that
in
this
situation.
ms.
gale
norton
it
would
have...
we
had
a
problem
with
our...
because
it
is
a
misdemeanor
in
some
situations,
we
would
not
be
able
to
do
that.
in
other
situations
it
was
trying
to
serve
warrants.
we
were
not
able
to
do
that.
ms.
gale
norton
no.
it's
twofold.
it's
also
our
interest
as
a
state
in
having
people
who
participate
in
our
law
making
process
be
citizens
and
registered
voters.
ms.
gale
norton
we
could
have
a
process
that
would
require
them
to
swear
an
oath
saying
that
they--
ms.
gale
norton
--residence
when
they
begin
the--
ms.
gale
norton
--initiative
process--
ms.
gale
norton
--and
then
when
they
end.
ms.
gale
norton
it's
a
question
of
timing.
ms.
gale
norton
that
is
correct.
ms.
gale
norton
yes,
we
do,
your
honor.
ms.
gale
norton
there
can
be
several
hundreds
in
any--
ms.
gale
norton
--in
any
given
petition
there
may
be
several
hundred
circulators.
ms.
gale
norton
that
is
correct.
ms.
gale
norton
yes,
it
does.
ms.
gale
norton
that
is
correct.
ms.
gale
norton
that
is
correct.
ms.
gale
norton
the
burdick
approach
that
we
would
urge
the
court
to
adopt
recognizes
that
there
is
both
core
speech
aspect,
where
there
would
be
a
severe
burden
on
that
speech,
potentially,
and
the
ability
of
the
states
to
have
a
regulatory
process.
ms.
gale
norton
meyer,
i
believe,
did
not
adequately
recognize
the
other
aspects
of
the
process.
it
focused
on
the
core
speech
part,
which
was
truly
at
issue
in
meyer,
and
did
not
look
at
the
other
issues
of
the
state
in--
ms.
gale
norton
--no.
core
speech--
ms.
gale
norton
--in
terms
of
advocacy,
that
is
one
part
of
it,
but
there
are
several
transactions
taking
place
simultaneously.
ms.
gale
norton
we
believe
the
state
and
local
government
center
in
its
brief
has
presented
a
fairly
accurate
view
of
what
the
transaction
ordinarily
looks
like.
it
is
an
attempt
to
get
as
many
people
through
to
just
sign,
rather
than
going
through
an
extensive
process
of
explaining
the
petition.
ms.
gale
norton
that
is
to
address
the
problem
that
we
have
of
trying
to
maintain
the
integrity
of
the
process
as
it
is
going
along.
if
the
secretary
of
state's
office
receives
a
phone
call
that
says,
i
saw
a
petition
circulator
paying
people
to
sign
petitions,
which
is
clearly
a
violation
of
state
law,
we
get
a
call
that
says,
it
was
a
man
with
brown
hair
standing
at
the
corner
of
sixth
and
broadway,
at
that
point
in
time,
we
don't
have
any
petitions.
we
can't
look
at
the
signature
on
that.
ms.
gale
norton
yes,
it
has,
and
that
is
reflected
in
the
record.
ms.
gale
norton
that
is...
that
has
been
a
problem
that
has
been
prosecuted.
that
is
an
example--
ms.
gale
norton
--there
have
not
been
recent
prosecutions
on
that.
ms.
gale
norton
i
believe
that
there
are
some
earlier
cases
on
that.
i've
not
seen
any
in
the
last--
ms.
gale
norton
--we've
had
an
example
that
is
reflected
in
the
record
where
the
opponent
saw
a
petition
circulator
misrepresenting
the
contents
of
the
petition.
they
took
pictures
of
the
circulator,
but
even
with
those
pictures
at
a
subsequent
hearing
we
were
not
able
to
identify
who
those
individuals--
ms.
gale
norton
--even
under
those
circumstances
it
is
an
individual
violation
for
the
circulator
to
engage
in
misconduct,
and
the
sponsor
may
or
may
not
be
able
to
identify
who
is
standing
on
a
particular
street
corner,
or
who
is
in
a
picture.
ms.
gale
norton
that
is
something
that
has
been
largely
dictated
by
federal
legislation
in
recent
years
that
has
caused
us
to
make
our
laws
less
strict.
ms.
gale
norton
we
used
to
be
more
careful
than
we
currently
are.
you
are
correct
that
we
are
not
able
to
be
as
careful
in
the
voter
registration
process.
ms.
gale
norton
i
would
urge
you
to
look
at
the
burdick
standard.
ms.
gale
norton
i
believe
that
the
burdick
standard
would
allow
you
to
take
into
account
both
the
pure
speech
aspects
of
it,
when
you
look--
ms.
gale
norton
--having
a
flexible
standard
such
that
a
severe
burden
on
speech
would
cause
a
strict
scrutiny
standard
to
be
applied.
ms.
gale
norton
pardon?
ms.
gale
norton
yes.
buckley--
ms.
gale
norton
--buckley
is
a
strict
scrutiny
case,
as
is
meyer
v.
grant.
ms.
gale
norton
i
would
urge
the
burdick
standard
as
allowing
the
examination
of
both
of
those
aspects.
ms.
gale
norton
timmons,
in
my
mind,
applies
the
same
standard.
ms.
gale
norton
meyer--
ms.
gale
norton
--i
believe
that
if
strict
scrutiny
is
applied
we
win
on
all
of
our
points
nevertheless.
however,
i
think
for...
from
the
state
perspective,
for
our
ability
to
regulate
our
process
and
understand
what
the
rules
are
going
to
be,
it
would
be
better
for
us,
it
would
make
more
sense
to
apply
the
burdick
and
to--
ms.
gale
norton
--no,
because
i
believe
that
under
strict
scrutiny
we
can
prevail
under
the
meyer
standard
as
well.
ms.
gale
norton
strict
scrutiny
was
the
standard
applied
in
buckley
v.
valeo,
as
well
as
in
other
cases
that
have
upheld
regulation
of
the
electoral--
ms.
gale
norton
--i
believe
that
that
was
the
standard
that
was
applied
to
the
disclosure
requirements
and
the
other
aspects
that
are
parallel
to
this
particular
case.
ms.
gale
norton
that
is
correct.
ms.
gale
norton
there
are...
there
are
some--
ms.
gale
norton
--the
briefs
have
been
filed
by
the
amici,
including
the
national
voter
outreach
organization,
which
employs
petition
circulators.
ms.
gale
norton
i
would
say,
vote
for
smith
is
meaningful
speech--
ms.
gale
norton
--sign
this
petition
is--
ms.
gale
norton
--sign
this
petition
is--
ms.
gale
norton
--asking
people
to
fulfill
an
elective
function.
ms.
gale
norton
meaningful
speech
with
a
combination
of
the
electoral
function.
ms.
gale
norton
then
the
state
is
left
with
no
way
to
ensure
that
those
54,000
signatures
are
collected--
ms.
gale
norton
--that's...
that
is--
ms.
gale
norton
--the
requirement
that
by
badge
they
identify
themselves
as
paid
solicitors
was
stricken
by
the
tenth
circuit.
ms.
gale
norton
but
the
tenth
circuit
did
not
differentiate.
thank
you.
ms.
gale
norton
may
it
please
the
court,
in
clarification
to
justice
kennedy's
question,
the
monthly
report
was
stricken
by
the
tenth
circuit
in
its
entirety.
the
final
report
was
stricken
to
the
extent
it
requires
individualized
reporting
regarding
the
circulators.
mr.
o'toole
is
correct
that
the
final
report
is
submitted
at
the
time
that
the
petition
itself
is
submitted.
there
are
examples
of
both
of
those
reports
in
the
joint
appendix
at
pages
41
and
45.
the
state
has
an
interest
in
preventing
fraud
and
misconduct
while
a
petition
is
being
circulated,
not
simply
bribery,
but
also
a
husband
signing
for
a
wife,
something
as
commonplace
as
that.
we
have
the
responsibility
to
the--
ms.
gale
norton
--certainly
the
state
does
care
about
these
things.
ms.
gale
norton
it
has
some
of
these
requirements
as--
ms.
gale
norton
--that
is
correct.
it
does
have
the
registration
requirement,
but
not
the
others.
the
badge
requirement
fulfills
the
function
of
providing
information
to
the
signer.
that
person
is
essentially
relying
on
the
circulator
as
a
fiduciary.
the
person
can...
the
voter
can
only
sign
a
petition
once.
once
they
have
signed
a
petition,
they
cannot
sign
that
same
petition
again,
and
so
once
they
have
given
over
their
signature
to
that
person,
they
have
given
them
a
trust
responsibility.
ms.
gale
norton
thank
you.
