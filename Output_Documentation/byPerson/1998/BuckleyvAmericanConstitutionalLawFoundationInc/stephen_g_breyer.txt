justice
stephen
g.
breyer
if...
i
just
have
one
question
i'd
like
to
ask,
which
is
that
if...
i
assume...
i'll
assume
for
argument's
sake
that
you're
right,
that
there's
an
aspect
in
which
this
petition
gatherer
is
like
a
voting
official
who
sits
in
a
booth,
so
the
state
can
regulate,
but
that
petition
gatherer
is
also
a
person
who's
likely
to
try
to
persuade
someone
to
sign
the
petition,
and
to
that
extent
there's
speech
involved,
persuasive
political
speech,
so
if
i
think
there's
both,
what
standard
do
i
apply,
and
which
case
do
you
look
to
to
give
me
the
right
standard?
in
other
words,
i
think
there's
a
lot
of
speech
involved,
but
i
also
think
it's
pretty
important
that
the
state
can
regulate
its
process
for
making
laws.
now...
so
i
think
both,
and
so
since
i
think
both,
what
case
do
i
look
to?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
burdick
was
just
a
question
of
write
ins,
wasn't
it?
that
was
pure
process,
or
pretty
pure
process,
so
i'm
still
looking.
i've
looked
in
the
labor
area,
like
picketing,
i've
looked
in...
there's...
but
i
want
your
opinion.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
burdick
standard
being--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--what
about
buckley,
too?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
buckley.
have
you
looked
at
buckley?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
so
what...
now,
thinking
of
both
those
cases,
what
standard
would
you
articulate
that
we
should
use?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--if
i
thought--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
if
i
thought
that
meyer
was
not
dealing
with
the
aspect
in
which
the
petition
gatherer
is
an
arm
of
the
state's
electoral
process,
which
the
state
could
regulate
from
that
point
of
view,
just
as
it
could
somebody
in
an
election
booth...
you
know,
the
person
who
sits
there...
but
both
are
involved,
what
standard
should
i
use?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
could
i
ask--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
is
it
possible--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--that...
the
compelling
state
interest--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--i
take
it
that's
being
advanced
is
that
they're
afraid
that
petition
gatherers
who
are
paid
will
say
to
people
in
shopping
centers,
i'll
give
you
a
dollar
if
you
sign
the
petition.
i'll
give
you
50
cents
if
you
sign
the
petition.
that's
at
least
what
they're
saying,
and
it's
not
implausible.
now,
if
that's
a
legitimate
interest,
and
it
sounds
like
one,
but
i
agree
with
you
that
this
is
unconstitutional,
would
i
also
have
to
hold
unconstitutional
an
effort
by
a
state
to
say,
we
want
disclosed
how
much
money
you
give
to
a
candidate?
in
other
words,
i'm
quite
concerned
about
deciding
for
you
in
this
case
and
then
finding
the
campaign
finance
issue
before
me
in
another
case
and
suddenly,
lo
and
behold,
i've
decided
that
issue
here.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why
not?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--no,
i
said
what
their
issue...
what
their
justification
is,
is
that
we're
afraid
that
arco
or
some
big
company,
and
maybe
it's
not
true
in
colorado,
but
it's
certainly
true
in
california,
that
very
often
large
companies
want
measures
on
the
ballot,
and
they'll
pay
people
to
gather
signatures.
and
what
they're
worried
about,
i
take
it,
in
colorado
is
a
paid
petition
gatherer
will
say,
i'll
pay
you
50
cents
if
you
write
your
name
down,
which
i
take
it
is
illegal,
and
they
want
a
ready
method
to
see
if
that's
happened,
and
this
is
their
ready
method,
and
that
justification's--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
i'm
trying
to
get
this...
this
is
what
i'm
thinking.
suppose
i
think
in
this
case
that
their
justification
is
trying
to
catch
petition
gatherers
who
will
pay
for
signatures.
now...
and
i
agree
with
you,
suppose
i
agree
with
you
that
despite
that
justification
this
is
unconstitutional.
then,
in
the
next
case,
someone
says,
remember
that
case
you
just
decided?
now,
the
state
here
is
requiring
various
kinds
of
disclosure
of
contributions
to
candidates
or
other
forms
of
finance
disclosure.
at
that
point
you
want
to
say,
that's
totally
different,
and
i
all
i
want
you
is
to
explain
why.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
know
you're
going
to
say
yes,
and
i
know
what--
[laughter]
perhaps
what
i
should
be
asking.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now...
maybe
what
i
should
be
asking,
but
what
i
actually
am
asking,
is--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--is
why
you
made
that
concession?
i'm
trying
to
get
in
my
mind
what
the
reason
is
that
distinguishes
between
those
two
things.
i'm
looking
for
the
rationale.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
then
why
do...
why
can
you
then...
why
could
you
then
compel
a
company
to
state
in
the
newspaper
that
it
is
contributed
$1,000
to
joe
jones,
who's
a
candidate,
in
the
form
of
promising
to
give
him
an
employment
contract
as
soon
as
he's
finished.
i
take
it
you
could
compel
the
latter,
or
can
you?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
then
why
couldn't
you?
how
do
you
reconcile
those?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
is
there
any
evidence
in
any
other
state...
i
mean,
this
occurred
in
a
state
which
had
these
requirements
which
they're
trying
to
defend.
is
there
any
evidence
from
states
that
don't
have
these
requirements--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
further
disclosures
near
to
the
time
of
the
election
are
not
before
us.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
but
is
it...
is
any
issue
about
those
disclosures--
