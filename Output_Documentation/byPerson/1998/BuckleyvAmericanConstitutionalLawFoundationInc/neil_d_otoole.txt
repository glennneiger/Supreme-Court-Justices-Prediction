mr.
neil
d.
o'toole
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
what
the
respondents
ask
this
court
to
do
is
to
fortify
and
reinforce
the
message
that
was
given
in
meyer
to
assure
that
the
activity
of
citizens
peaceably
gathering
together
to
change
government
under
a
constitutional
system
such
as
we
have
in
the
state
of
colorado
is
furthered
by
the
first
amendment.
mr.
neil
d.
o'toole
i--
mr.
neil
d.
o'toole
--the
reason
we
ask
you...
your
honor,
i
would
say
to
you
that
unfortunately
reviewing
decisions
from
other
circuits
it
appears
that
there's
some
question
about
what
this
court
meant
in
meyer.
i
think
it's
clear.
i
don't
think
there's
any
doubt.
i
think
the
test
that's
laid
out
in
meyer,
that
talks
about
the
burden
being
well
nigh
insurmountable,
couldn't
be
clearer.
mr.
neil
d.
o'toole
mr.
chief
justice,
i
beg
to
differ
with
you
on
that
issue.
i
think--
mr.
neil
d.
o'toole
--i--
mr.
neil
d.
o'toole
--i'd
say
that
the
facts
because
of
facts
differ,
that
evidence
that
was
presented
in
this
case
was
not
necessarily
the
same
evidence
presented
in
meyer.
the
facts
described
in
response
to
justice
kennedy
are
very
close.
mr.
neil
d.
o'toole
i
understand.
mr.
neil
d.
o'toole
excuse
me,
mr.
chief
justice.
we're
not
dealing
with
prohibition
against
paid
circulators.
we
are
dealing
with
prohibition
against
the
circulation
of
petitions
by
residents
or
nonresidents
who
do
not
deign,
for
one
reason
or
another,
to
become
a
registered
voter.
we're
dealing
with
their
ability
to
be
engaged
in
the
same--
mr.
neil
d.
o'toole
--yes--
mr.
neil
d.
o'toole
--yes,
justice
o'connor.
we're
dealing
with
that
issue.
mr.
neil
d.
o'toole
that
is
correct.
mr.
neil
d.
o'toole
that
is
correct.
it's
5
per--
mr.
neil
d.
o'toole
--your
honor--
mr.
neil
d.
o'toole
--your
honor,
in
terms
of
how
i'm
addressing
this
issue
with
regard
to
registered
circulators
who
are
aggrieved
in
the
speech
process,
i
do
believe
there
might
be
a
different
analysis
that
would
attend
whether
or
not
or
how
the
state
assures
that
it
has
a
modicum
of
public
support
for
the
measure
so
it's
on
the
ballot.
mr.
neil
d.
o'toole
in
my
opinion,
yes.
mr.
neil
d.
o'toole
because
i
believe
that--
mr.
neil
d.
o'toole
--it's
possible.
mr.
neil
d.
o'toole
--haven't
even
paid
for
that
yet
or
volunteered
yet,
your
honor.
mr.
neil
d.
o'toole
because
i'm
asked
the
questions.
mr.
neil
d.
o'toole
oh,
i...
no,
your
honor,
i
don't.
i
was
asked
a
question
by
the...
by
justice
o'connor,
and
i
felt,
in
light
of
the
court's--
mr.
neil
d.
o'toole
--i
was
asked
that
question.
i'm
giving
you
an
answer.
my
answer
is
no,
but
for
purposes
of
this
case,
that
other
issue
is
not
before
us.
we
are
dealing
with
core
political
speech,
justice
scalia,
and
i
believe
that
the
process
is
adequately
delineated
in
footnote
4
of
the
meyer
decision.
mr.
neil
d.
o'toole
not
to
the
same
extent,
because
he's
proceeding
with...
i
think
this
court
has
consistently
drawn
a
distinction
between
ballot
initiative,
where
there's
a
discussion
of
issues
and
a
discussion
of
candidates.
mr.
neil
d.
o'toole
but
of
course
they
are
engaging--
mr.
neil
d.
o'toole
--well,
the
state's
interest
differs,
because
under
the
state...
in
the
state
of
colorado,
chief
justice,
we
have
a
situation
where
the
people
reserve
to
themselves
the
right
to
petition
or
circulate
a
citizen's
initiative
and,
in
fact,
the
state's
involvement
does
not
occur
until
that
petition
itself
is
submitted
to
the
secretary
of
state
for
approval
of
the
measure
in
terms
of
being
placed
on
the
ballot.
mr.
neil
d.
o'toole
the
cases
on
candidacy
in
my
review
of
them,
and
it
may
not
have
been
as
scholarly
a
review
as
might
be
required
under
the
circumstances,
but
i
will
say
to
you
that
this
discussion
is
not
over
a
crowded
ballot.
this
is
not
over
a
question
of
who
can
be
on
the
ballot...
this
candidacy
is
not
a
right...
but
is
over
the
actions
of
people
who
gather--
mr.
neil
d.
o'toole
--certainly.
mr.
neil
d.
o'toole
because
the
state...
chief
justice,
the
state's
interest
in
curtailing
debate
and
consideration
and
discussion
is
significantly
less
in
the
former
than
in
the
latter.
in
the
citizen's
petition
we
have
a
system
which
guarantees
discussion
and
debate.
we
have
a
core
discussion
of
a
political
issue.
the
state
has
no
power
to
determine
what
issues--
mr.
neil
d.
o'toole
--yes,
justice.
mr.
neil
d.
o'toole
yes,
justice.
mr.
neil
d.
o'toole
yes.
mr.
neil
d.
o'toole
as
a
factual
question
it
may,
but
it
doesn't.
the--
mr.
neil
d.
o'toole
--no,
i'm
sorry,
you
said
it
may.
mr.
neil
d.
o'toole
in
fact,
it
does
not
apply
to
recall
or
candidate
petition,
the
badge
requirement,
or
the
paid
circulator
badge
requirement,
or
the
paid
circulator
reporting
requirements
do
not
apply
to
either
the--
mr.
neil
d.
o'toole
--candidate's
petition
or
the
recall
petition.
mr.
neil
d.
o'toole
that's
correct.
mr.
neil
d.
o'toole
i...
we
fail
to
see
a
compelling
state
interest
in--
mr.
neil
d.
o'toole
--in...
sorry.
mr.
neil
d.
o'toole
excuse
me.
mr.
neil
d.
o'toole
the
answer
is
no,
justice.
mr.
neil
d.
o'toole
and
the
reason
is
that
the
state
interest
in
avoiding
the
possibility
or
view
of
corruption
simply
isn't
present
in
a
balloting
issue.
mr.
neil
d.
o'toole
that
is
correct,
how
much
has
been
expended,
justice
ginsburg.
mr.
neil
d.
o'toole
on
every
individual
petition
section,
the
name
of
the
circulator
appears.
mr.
neil
d.
o'toole
our
answer
is
no.
we
believe
that
the
process
that
is
employed
by
the
state
of
colorado
is
intended
to
do
one
thing,
and
that
is
to
hinder
the
process
of
collecting
signatures
and
for
individuals
to
engage
in
political
speech.
mr.
neil
d.
o'toole
chief...
chief
justice,
of
course
they
can
regulate
it,
and
they
do.
they
have
criminal
sanctions
for
the
violation
of
the
act.
they
have
extensive
criminal--
mr.
neil
d.
o'toole
--what
is
sought
in
colorado,
justice,
is
a
prophylactic
measure
to
assist
the
efficiency
of
the
state
at
the
cost
of
the
first
amendment.
now,
efficiency
never
does
take
a
back
seat,
and
in
this
particular
case
the
efficiency
of
identifying
these
individuals
with
a
badge...
and,
by
the
way,
this
goes
to
volunteer
as
well
as
non,
or
paid
circulators,
and
certain
reporting
requirements
only
go
to
paid
circulators
but
not
to
voluntary
circulators.
those
requirements
essentially
chill
the
process
involved
in
core
political
speech
which
is
described--
mr.
neil
d.
o'toole
--i
have
no
objection
to
that--
mr.
neil
d.
o'toole
--none.
mr.
neil
d.
o'toole
your
honor,
it
is
disclosed
on
the
petition.
mr.
neil
d.
o'toole
i'm
glad
you
know
that.
mr.
neil
d.
o'toole
thank
you,
justice
scalia.
mr.
neil
d.
o'toole
your
honor,
in
fact,
as
we
tried
this
case,
and
as
we
presented
in
our
complaint,
we
did
not
make
that
concession,
and
in
fact
we
challenged
the
affidavit
requirement
because
we
believed
there
were
more
or
less
restrictive
means
in
which
to
gather
the
ensuring
of
a
modicum
of
state
support
was
there.
however--
mr.
neil
d.
o'toole
--the
public
does
know,
in
colorado,
who
has
contributed
to
a
citizens'
initiative.
that
is
reported.
contributions
are
not
at
stake
here.
what
we're
talking
about
are
reporting
requirements
for
individuals
who
are
engaged
in
this
very
specific
area
of
protected
speech
with
their
names,
their
addresses,
their
business
addresses,
and
they
are
reported
while--
mr.
neil
d.
o'toole
--no.
mr.
neil
d.
o'toole
in
fact,
justice
ginsburg,
i
apologize
if
i
gave
you
that
impression.
we
did
oppose
the
affidavit
requirement
because
we
thought
it
identified
individuals
too
closely
with
contentious
issues.
we
did
not
challenge
the
expenditure
reporting
requirements
as
found
under
the
campaign
act.
we
never
challenged
that,
but
we
did
challenge
those
parts
of
the
statute
which
singled
out
paid
circulators,
identified
them
with
issues,
allowed
them
to
be
subjected
to
potential--
mr.
neil
d.
o'toole
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
neil
d.
o'toole
that's
correct.
mr.
neil
d.
o'toole
at
this
juncture,
it
is
certainly
more
than
adequate
information
to
allow
the
state
to
proceed
with
any
interest
they
have.
the
mention
of
fraud
is
a
talismanic
incantation
in
these
cases,
and
the
long
and
the
short
of
it
is,
we
don't
see
it.
mr.
neil
d.
o'toole
yes,
justice--
mr.
neil
d.
o'toole
--yes,
i
would,
and
it
would
be
the
same
objection
that
we
have
to
the
badge,
justice
kennedy,
and
the
reason
i'd
object
to
it
is
that
the
protection
that's
accorded
to
somebody
that's
paid
in
this
sacred
area
of
political
discussion
is
the
same,
and
there
is
no
reason...
there
are
three...
i
think
we
have...
you
know,
basically
this
disclosure
says
that
we
have
the...
forces
the
individual
to
fear...
i
mean,
or
have
the
risk
of
fear
of
government
reprisal--
mr.
neil
d.
o'toole
--all
right.
i'm
sorry.
mr.
neil
d.
o'toole
it
does
not
promote
free
speech
of
the
individual
seeking
to
speech...
to
speak.
it...
justice
kennedy,
i
believe
it
may
promote
some
interest
in
giving
more
information
to
the
recipient
of
that
speech,
which
it
is
our
opinion
is
not
the
purpose
of
the
first
amendment.
mr.
neil
d.
o'toole
forget
the
badge.
mr.
neil
d.
o'toole
it
is
our
position
that
that
prophylactic...
whatever...
for
whatever...
first
off,
is
there
a
reason
for
that?
is
the
reason--
mr.
neil
d.
o'toole
--that's
not
a
compelling
state
interest
that
overcomes
the
right
of
the
individual
to
participate
in
anonymous
speech.
that's
my
answer
to
that.
mr.
neil
d.
o'toole
that
individual
does
not
have
to
speak.
it's
compelled
speech.
that
individual
is
being
compelled
to
speak.
mr.
neil
d.
o'toole
ah.
well,
in
the
disclosure
report
what
is
allowed
is
a
generalized
reporting
that
says
expenditures
were
made
to
national
voter
outreach.
now...
or
whatever
paid
circulation
is
taking
place.
remember,
we
still
haven't
gotten
to
the
registered
circulators
in
a...
by
the
way,
there
is
no
empirical
evidence
that
it
turns
out
that
registered
voters
are
less
likely
to--
mr.
neil
d.
o'toole
--commit
fraud
than--
mr.
neil
d.
o'toole
--it
certainly
would
be--
mr.
neil
d.
o'toole
--could
you
require
that.
i...
your
honor--
mr.
neil
d.
o'toole
--you
could
require
that.
if
you
require
that,
that's
what's
going
to
be
done.
but
the
answer
to
that
i'd
say
is,
to
the
extent
that
it
creates
an
impediment
to
discussion
and
compels
speech,
which
the
speaker
has
a
right
to
determine
and
select,
it
is
the
nature
of
his
conversation.
mr.
neil
d.
o'toole
i
would
say--
mr.
neil
d.
o'toole
--you're...
the
part
of
the
speech
that
you're
compelling
is
not
the
contribution.
you're
compelling
the
reason.
you're
compelling
the
inherent
basis
of
the
conversation--
mr.
neil
d.
o'toole
--and
the
political
purpose.
mr.
neil
d.
o'toole
they
can
ask.
in
terms
of
the
process,
justice
kennedy,
you
asked
about
that.
i
direct
your
attention
to
footnote
4
in
the
meyer
brief.
also
there
is
adequate...
there
is
discussion
in
the
transcript
of
the...
of
how
the
process
works,
and
it
involves
going
door
to
door
on
occasion,
but
also
going
to
the
malls.
mr.
neil
d.
o'toole
justice
stevens--
mr.
neil
d.
o'toole
--justice
stevens,
we
argued
in
the
brief
we
think
the
evidence--
mr.
neil
d.
o'toole
--i'm
sorry.
mr.
neil
d.
o'toole
the
evidence
is
more
indirect
than
direct.
the
evidence
substantiates
that
in
1992
there
were
12...
1,200,000
signatures
submitted.
the
state
detected
approximately
2,000
of
those
signatures
obtained
by
fraud.
that's
a
fifth
of
a
percent,
or
less
than
a
fifth
of
a
percent.
that
is
the
evidence
of
fraud,
and
that
is--
mr.
neil
d.
o'toole
--looked
like
15...
9
to
15.
i
think
they
got
three
convictions.
they
did
have
a...
and
that's
part
of
the
appellee's
supplemental
appendix,
where
they
had
a
hearing
before
the
secretary
of
state
to
determine
whether
certain
acts
had
violated
1-40-130,
which
is
the
criminal
execution
statutes
in
the
petition,
and
they
were
not
able
to
find
any
evidence
of
fraudulent
dissemination
of
information,
and--
mr.
neil
d.
o'toole
--the
only
evidence
is
that
9
to
15
individuals
who
were
paid
circulators
may
have
engaged
in
fraud,
3
of
whom
got
convicted
of
forgery.
what
they
actually
did,
they
violated
the...
they
made
it
a
class
4
felony.
they
used...
they
wrote
in
the
identity
of
individuals.
the
secretary
of
state,
who
had
the
power
to
check
every
signature--
mr.
neil
d.
o'toole
--that's--
mr.
neil
d.
o'toole
--they
forged
names.
i
mean,
they
forged
signatures,
names,
they
went
through
a
telephone
book.
mr.
neil
d.
o'toole
absolutely.
mr.
neil
d.
o'toole
none.
mr.
neil
d.
o'toole
there
was
evidence
that
in
the
state
of
washington,
and
that's
a
higher
quantum
of
signatures
needed
to
show
a
modicum
of
support,
that
there
was
likewise
approximately
1,500
signatures.
it
turned
out
in
that
particular
case
factually,
and
it's
part
of
the
amicus
brief
from
the
states,
that
the
proponents,
who
are
the
first
to
worry
about
fraud
and
being
tainted
with
fraud,
found
that
there
had
been
fraud
by
circulators,
that
they
had
been
defrauded,
and
had
therefore
turned
that
in.
there's
evidence
also
in
this
case
that
in
one
such
incident
the
proponent
had
paid
somebody
approximately
for
6,000
more
signatures
than
they
actually
got,
and
they
thought
they
defrauded--
mr.
neil
d.
o'toole
--they
get
paid
by
the--
mr.
neil
d.
o'toole
--absolutely.
mr.
neil
d.
o'toole
and
in
fact
when
i...
i
was
involved
in
the
worker's
choice
of
care
amendment.
we
set
up
very
stringent
guidelines
to
check
every
single
signature.
mr.
neil
d.
o'toole
well,
to
the
extent
that
a
sponsor
involves
himself
or
herself
in
fraud,
they
are
likewise
going
to
be...
could
likewise
be
penalty...
penalized--
mr.
neil
d.
o'toole
--no.
as
far
as
i...
no,
there
is
not
a
respondeat
superior
liability.
i'm
aware
of
no
instances
in
which
the
proponent
has
been
charged
and
convicted
where...
in
the
absence
of
any
overt
act
on
the
proponent's
part
to...
or
permit
the
fraud,
or
encourage
the
fraud.
mr.
neil
d.
o'toole
no,
they...
no,
they
don't.
they
give
a...
in
the
reporting
requirement
which
was
not
struck
down,
and
which
is
not
before
this
court,
they
give
a
general
reporting
of
expenditures,
the
amount,
and
in
this
particular
instance
the
amount
paid
to
circulate
petitions,
there'll
be
another
line
item,
the
amount
it
cost
to
buy
petitions
and
have
them--
mr.
neil
d.
o'toole
--you
could
if
there
was
a
breakdown
that
the
secretary
did,
but
they
don't.
mr.
neil
d.
o'toole
i'm
sorry.
mr.
neil
d.
o'toole
your
honor,
if
you
ask
that
question
of
me--
mr.
neil
d.
o'toole
--i
will
tell
you
that
the
reporting
requirement
as
i
understand
it
is
an
expenditure,
and
it's
a
global
expenditure
requirement.
the
requirement
that
was
struck
down
was
one
which
required
the
distinct
reporting
of
paid
circulator's
names,
addresses,
and
identifying
information.
mr.
neil
d.
o'toole
monthly,
exactly
right,
whereas
at
the
end,
the
evidence,
or
the
record
of
the
paid
circulators
is
really
no
different
from
the
record
of
non,
or
voluntary
circulators.
what
happens
is,
the
petitions
get
turned
in.
those
petitions
contain
the
name
of
the
individual
who
circulated
the
petition.
mr.
neil
d.
o'toole
that
information
is
what
the
secretary
of
state
uses
to
first
determine--
mr.
neil
d.
o'toole
--so--
mr.
neil
d.
o'toole
--i
paid
j&j
printing
company
$5,000
to
print
my
petition.
mr.
neil
d.
o'toole
this
is--
mr.
neil
d.
o'toole
--that's
correct.
mr.
neil
d.
o'toole
it
has
been
applied
as
a
general
reporting
requirement,
where
in
1992
we
indicated
we
paid...
i
forget,
whatever.
i
think
it
was
$40,000
to
national
voter
outreach
for
circulation
of
petitioners
without
identifying
line
by
line
the
identity
of
the--
mr.
neil
d.
o'toole
--correct.
mr.
neil
d.
o'toole
employees...
they...
they're
paid
on
a
per
signature
basis
under
our
law
in
the
state
of
colorado.
they'd
be
independent
contractors.
the
answer
to
that
question
is--
mr.
neil
d.
o'toole
--oh,
i'm
sorry,
justice--
mr.
neil
d.
o'toole
--the
disclosure
is
made
when
the
petitions
are
filed
with
the
secretary
of
state.
mr.
neil
d.
o'toole
the
same
day.
there
are
further
disclosures
that
take
place
just
prior
to
the
election.
mr.
neil
d.
o'toole
that
is
correct.
mr.
neil
d.
o'toole
it's
near
the
time
of
the
election,
and
i--
mr.
neil
d.
o'toole
--no,
your
honor,
there
is
not.
the
only
issue
in
that
disclosure
is
the
requirement
that
while
the
petition
is
being
circulated,
while
that
contentious
issue
is
before
the
public,
these
individuals,
who
by
virtue
of
the
sole
fact
that
they
are
paid,
have
to
be
identified.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
