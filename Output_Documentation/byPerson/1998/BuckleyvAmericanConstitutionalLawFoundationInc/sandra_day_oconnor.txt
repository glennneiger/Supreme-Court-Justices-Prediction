justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--what
is
the
interest
of
the
state
that
you
say
supports
the
requirement
that
the
circulators
have
to
be
registered
voters?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
in
light
of
meyer,
i
would
have
thought
the
state
would
have
a
hard
time
asserting
that
its
interest
in
having
them
be
registered
voters
can
prevail.
no
doubt
there
are
people
in
the
state
who
are
not
registered
voters,
but
who
nonetheless
would
like
to
serve
as
petition
circulators
and
debate
the
merits
of
given
issues.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--well,
why
can't
somebody
who
is
a
resident
of
colorado,
who's
an
adult
resident,
perform
that
function
just
as
well
as
somebody
who's
a
registered
voter?
i
just
don't
understand.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes,
but
you
require
an
affidavit
at
the
end
of
the
day,
when
the
petition
is
filed,
that
the
circulator
is,
in
fact,
a
resident.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
you
have
the
normal
criminal
laws
that
could
enforce
that,
so
it's
very
difficult
for
me
to
understand,
in
the
face
of
meyer,
what
state
justification
you
can
offer
for
also
requiring
that
the
circulator
be
a
registered
voter.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
may
i
ask
on
candidate
petitions,
petitions
circulated
in
order
to
enable
someone
to
run
as
a
candidate
in
an
election,
they
also
use
petition
circulators.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
does
colorado
law
require
that
those
circulators
be
registered
voters?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
presumably
the
same
argument
made
here
today
with
regard
to
the
petition
circulation
would
apply
to
candidate
petitions
as
well--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--if
the
respondents
are
correct.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
why
does
the
state
insist
that
the
circulator
have
to
have
the
circulator's
name
on
a
badge,
as
opposed
to
just
saying,
volunteer,
or
paid
circulator?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
for
you
to
win
do
you
have...
do
we
have
to
somehow
modify
meyer?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
or
clarify
it,
or
restrict
it,
for
you
to
win
on
all
these
points?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
despite
the
fact
that
the
voter
registration
requirement
and
the
disclosure
of
the
name
seem
to
fly
squarely
in
the
face
of
what
the
court
said
in
meyer.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
didn't
think
we
were
dealing
with
residents
versus
nonresidents.
i
thought
we
were
dealing
with
a
requirement
that
the
circulator
be
a
registered
voter
in
colorado.
is
that
what
we're
dealing
with?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
thank
you.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
now,
at
the
same
time,
i
guess
colorado,
like
other
states,
requires
a
certain
number
of
signatures
from
registered
voters.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
a
certain
percentage,
in
order
to
gain
access
to
the
ballot
for
a
petition.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
now,
under
your
theory,
i
guess,
that
also
inhibits
speech,
because
it
deters
the
filing
of
these
initiative
petitions.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
what
if
colorado
tried
to
increase
the
number
of
signatures
required?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
does
strict
scrutiny
apply
to
that
requirement,
in
your
view?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mm
hmm.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
that's
the
next
step
we'll
face.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
i
thought
people
reserved
to
themselves
the
right
to
decide
what
candidates
will
get
enough
signatures
to
have
their
names
go
on
the
ballot.
they
reserve
that
to
themselves.
why
isn't
that
core
political
speech?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
the
state
doesn't
care
about
this,
these
things
with
candidate
petitions?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
it
doesn't
have
these
requirements.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
not
the
badge
and
the
paid
versus
the
unpaid
and
the
requirements
we're
talking
about
here.
