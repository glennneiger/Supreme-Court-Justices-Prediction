--that
may
be
filed
with
the
petition
when
the
petition
is
completed?
isn't
that
when
that
report
gets
filed?
i
thought
the
monthly
reports
were
while
the
petition
was
in
circulation.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
when
the
completed
petition
is
there,
and
the
sponsor
says,
we
have
enough
votes,
at
that
time
the
so
called
final
report
would
go
in?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
is
it
any
part
of
your
rationale
on
the
registered
voters
that
if
you
don't
want
to
count
yourself
in
the
political
community
by
not
voting,
you
shouldn't
take
part
in
this,
or
is
it
simply
a
kind
of
way
of
verifying
that
the
person
is,
indeed,
a
resident?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
general
norton,
if
you
have
the
petition
with
the
person's
name
on
it,
and
you
have
a
badge
that
says,
paid
solicitor,
and
the
sponsor's
name,
just
not
that
person's
name,
then
the
burden
that
you
have
been
informing
us
of
is
substantially
reduced,
is
it
not?
i
mean,
you
know
from
the
petition
who
were
the
signers
of
that
particular
petition.
the
person
is
required
to
identify
the
sponsor,
and
that
that
person
is
paid
or
volunteer.
why
isn't
that
adequate?
why
do
you
need
the
name
in
addition?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
if
you
knew
the
sponsor,
if
the
sponsor
had
to
be
identified,
if
you
had
everything
that
you
now
require
on
the
badge,
why...
and
you
have
the
picture,
well,
the
sponsor
knows
who's
been
hired,
don't
they?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
why
not
the
timmons,
which
is
the
more
recent
precedent?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
isn't
that
passed
in
meyer?
i
mean,
the
question
there
was,
could
you
have
paid
solicitors
for
initiatives,
and
the
court
said
that
the
job
that's
being
done,
asking
people
to
sign
the
thing,
involves
core
speech,
so
i
think
in
light
of
justice
kennedy's
question
that
the
answer's
got
to
be
yes.
if
you're
going
to
say
that
no,
this
really
isn't
core
speech,
then
you
have
to
qualify
meyer,
that
said
it
is.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
wasn't
there
first
a
good
part
of
this
that
the
tenth
circuit
upheld?
i
mean,
they
didn't
just
strike
down
this
thing
wholesale,
and
at
least
as
i
read
it,
it
comes...
it
permits
the
identification
of
the
sponsor,
the
statement
whether
a
person
is
paid
or
volunteer.
what
it
doesn't
permit
is
the
name,
insistence
that
the
name
go
on
the
badge,
and
that
the
amount
spent
not
only
in
gross
for
all
petition
solicitors
but
person
by
person,
but
that's...
but
that's
really
what's
at
stake,
the
name,
and
do
you
have
to
not
only
tell
how
much
you
spent
on
solicitors
altogether,
but
how
much
you
paid
each
individual?
as
i
understand
it,
that's
all
that's
at
stake.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--yes,
but
as
far
as
i
understand,
they
were
doing
that
in
connection
with
a
name
as
well.
do
we
know
from
this
case
whether,
if
all
that
the
law
required
was,
paid
by
x
sponsor,
that
that...
that
the
tenth
circuit
would
have
found
anything
wrong
with
that?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
let
me
ask
you--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
o'toole--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--mr.
o'toole,
may
i
just
intervene
at
that
point,
because
they're...
we're
talking
as
though
there
were
no
measures
in
california,
and
i
think
it
ought
to
be
taken
out
of
this
case
that
how
much
the
sponsor
paid
must
indeed
be
disclosed,
and
the
tenth
circuit
upheld
that
final
report
without
any
ifs,
ands,
or
buts,
so
the
sponsor
must
tell
how
much
it
is
paying
to
get
this
measure
on
the
ballot.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
in
addition,
there
must
be
the
name
of
the
collector
of
signatures
on
each
one
of
these
petition
collection
sheets
that
he
hands
the--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--and
that
would
be
plus
the
sponsor,
so
we're
not
talking
about
a
void
of
information.
we're
talking
about
colorado
has
some
information
requirement
which
the
tenth
circuit
has
upheld.
the
question
is,
isn't
colorado
entitled,
despite
first
amendment
concerns,
to
more
than
that?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
that
i
don't
understand
based
on
buckley,
because
if...
let's
just
make
it
with
a
volunteer
contributor.
if
i
am
required
to
disclose
how
much
money
i
give,
why
isn't
it
equally
constitutional
for
me
to
say
i
didn't
have
the
money
but
i
gave
personal
services
instead?
why
shouldn't
the
public
know
who
is
contributing
to
this
candidate,
and
some
may
contribute
money,
and
some
may
contribute
personal
services?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
i
thought
you
just
said
you
objected
to
the
whole
thing,
including
the
report--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--that
the
sponsor
has
to
file,
which
as
i
understand
it
says,
i
am
the
sponsor
of
the
initiative,
here
it
is
ready
to
go
on
the
ballot,
i
spent
x
amount
for
paid
solicitation.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
whatever
you
did,
does
the
state
of
colorado
have
any
laws
that
are
aimed
at
the
sponsor,
the
one
who
pays,
as
distinguished
from
the
person
who
receives
the
payment?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
there's
no
kind
of
respondeat
superior
liability.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the...
what
the
sponsor
must
disclose,
in
addition
to
the
total
amount
spent
on
paid
petitions,
do
they...
they
have
to
break
that
down
into
the
per
signature
amount?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--the
monthly...
the
monthly
one
was--
