justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
may
i
ask
just
one
factual
question?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
understand
there's
a
final
reporting
requirement,
a
disclosure
requirement,
and
that
is
not
challenged
here.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
does
the
financial
disclosure
that's
made
at
the
end,
and
it's
not
challenged,
separate
out
the
amount
that's
paid
for
solicitors,
so
if
i
read
the
report
i
know
that
they
spent
x
dollars
for
tv
advertising
and
y
dollars
for...
to
pay
circulators?
do
i...
can
i
find
that
out
from
the
final
report?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what
i'm
asking,
is
it
a
lump
sum,
or
is
it
separated
out?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
when
is
that
final
report
due?
is
that
before
the
election
or
after?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is
there
anything
in
the
monthly
disclosure
statements
that
break
it
down
expenditure
by
expenditure,
so
if
i
looked
at
the
monthly
disclosure
statement,
could
i
see
how
much
was
paid
just
for
circulating?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
that
was
struck
down.
has
anything
in
the
monthly
disclosure
statement
been
allowed
to
stand--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--by
the
district
court's
opinion?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
all
right.
in
that
monthly
disclosure
statement,
so
far
as
the
statute
has
been
allowed
to
stand--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--can
i
see
how
much
is
paid,
lump
sum,
for
circulation?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
except
that's
been
struck
down.
okay.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
suppose
that
it
were
shown
that
in
most
cases
in
colorado
initiatives
were
circulated
by
paid
solicitors
who
didn't
really
care
which
side
they
were
on,
they
were
just
doing
it
to
get
the
pay,
they'd
circulate
a
petition
on
either
side
of
any
issue.
suppose
that
were
the
fact
most
of
the
time.
would
that
undermine
the
rationale
of
our
recent
opinion
in
meyers?
it
was
unanimous
opinion.
it
was
recent.
i
doubt
that
we
would
want
to
revisit
it.
i
noticed
in
your
brief
that
you
seem
to
be
questioning
the
rationale
that
core
speech
does
take
place
at
the
in
it...
at
the
signature
gathering
stage.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
burdick
was
in
the
context
of
a
primary
election,
with
rules
about
parties
and
so
forth,
and
the
assumption
of
meyers
was
that
a
core
speech
function,
a
very
viable
speech
function
in
the
initiative
process
takes
place
at
the
signature
gathering
stage,
so
that
it's
not
analogous
to
the
candidate
qualifying
thing,
and
i'm
asking
if
you
think
that
distinction
holds.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
are
you
saying
that
core
speech
does
not
take
place
routinely
in
the
signature
gathering
process,
and
you're
denying
that
as
an
empirical
matter
that
the
court
is
factually
wrong?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
you
can
say
we're
wrong
if
you
think
we're
wrong.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
let
me
put
the...
justice
o'connor's
question
slightly
differently.
if
you
cannot
prevail
under
strict
scrutiny,
then
you
cannot
prevail
unless
we
modify
meyer.
isn't
that
correct?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
if
i
thought
that
this
case
turned
on
whether
or
not
there
really
was
meaningful
speech
at
the
signature
gathering
process,
if
i
thought
that
was
determinative,
where
would
i
go
to
find
that
out?
have
there
been
things
written
about
it,
or--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--this
record
is
very
sparse
on
all
of
these
points.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
would
you--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--think
it
constitutional
to
require
in
bold
face
type
on
the
front,
as
a
cover
sheet
for
any
initiative
that
a
voter
signs,
the
statement,
this
init...
this
petition
is
being
circulated
by
a
paid
circulator,
or
an
unpaid
circulator,
as
the
case
may
be?
would
you
object
to
that?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
now--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--it
seems
to
me
that
this
promotes
free
speech
rather
than
retards
it.
it
gives
the
voter
who's
considering
signing
the
petition
added
information.
does
it--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--what's
the
evil
that
follows
from
my
hypothetical,
because
you
know
what's
next,
because
i'm
going
to
say,
well,
what's
wrong
with,
say,
a
badge...
forget
the
badge.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
let's
say
that
it's
right
on
the
affidavit.
this
petition
is
being
circulated
by
a
paid
or
unpaid
volunteer.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
oh,
the
state
says
this
gives
information
to
the
voter
that
the
voter
would
need.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it's
not
anonymous.
you
don't
have
to
give
your
name.
all
you
have
to
say
is
whether
you're
paid
or
not
paid.
you're
still
anonymous.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but
you
allow
it
on
the
disclosure
report.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
suppose
another--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--i
suppose
another
answer
to
my
question
is,
if
it's
important
to
the
voter,
you
can
ask,
are
you
been
paid
or
not.
if
the
voter
thinks
it's
important--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
how
soon
before
the
election
is
that
final
disclosure
statement
made?
i'm
over
here.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
or
is
it
made
after
the
election?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
the
same
day?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
this
disclosure,
this
global
disclosure,
with
the
lump
sum
amount
paid
for
circulation,
is
filed
at
the
time
the
petitions
are
filed?
