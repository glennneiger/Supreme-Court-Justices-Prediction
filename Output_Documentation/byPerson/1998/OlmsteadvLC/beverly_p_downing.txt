ms.
beverly
p.
downing
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
title
ii
a
of
the
americans
with
disabilities
act,
that
general
language
prohibiting
discrimination
by
reason
of
disability,
cannot
impose
a
least
restrictive
treatment
requirement
on
the
state's
provision
of
hospital
services
to
its
disabled
citizens.
by
reenacting
essentially
the
same
language
of
section
504
of
the
rehabilitation
act
of
1973,
congress
did
not
suddenly
impose
or
allow
the
department
of
justice
to
impose
de
institutionalization
on
the
states.
georgia
believes
that
this
expansive
new
interpretation
of
the
ada
is
precluded
by
the
language
of
the
statute,
is
precluded
by
the
court's
prior
interpretations
of
section
504,
would
require
a
plain
statement
in
the
statute
which
is
undeniably
missing,
and
that
the
federal
government's
inconsistent
interpretation
of
its
integration
regulation
is
not
entitled
to
deference.
here,
the
general
language
of
the
statute
prohibiting
discrimination
by
reason
of
disability
is
being
used
to
bar
the
provision
of
hospital
services
offered
on
a
voluntary
basis
unless
georgia,
at
the
same
time,
fully
funds
all
demand
for
another
service,
a
community
bed.
but
by
providing
a
person
with
a
hospital
bed
and
by
asking
the
person
to
wait
a
short
time
until
a
community
bed
is
available,
georgia
does
not
exclude
a
person
by
reason
of
disability,
neither
does
georgia
discriminate
against
her
by
reason
of
disability.
what
georgia
did
here
was
simply
to
provide
hospital
services
to
two
mentally
disabled
patients.
there
appears
to
be
little
debate
as
to
the
involuntary
treatment
that
was
provided
to
these
patients
when
they
were
eminently
dangerous
to
themselves
or
others
and
did
not
consent
to
that
treatment.
it
would
be
illegal
under
georgia
law,
the
constitution,
and
presumably
the
ada
to
confine
them
involuntarily
without
a
medical
and
dangerousness
justification.
and
georgia
did
not
do
that,
and
there
appears
to
be
little
contention
that
they
did.
ms.
beverly
p.
downing
your
honor,
at
the
point
that
the
patients
were
placed,
they
did...
they
were
appropriate
for
placement
in
the
community
and
they
did
have
to
wait
a
short
time
in
order
to
make
their
way
up
the
waiting
list.
there
were
times
prior
to
the
time
that
they
were
placed
when
the
parties
would
dispute
whether
they
were
appropriate
for
community
treatment
or
not,
but
at
the
time
that
they
were
placed
and
for
a
short
time
before,
we
would
agree
that
they
were
appropriate.
ms.
beverly
p.
downing
your
honor,
it's
our
understanding
that...
that
it's
actually
the
government's
position
that
the
state
would
not
be
required
to
have
community
placements.
in...
in
georgia,
there
are
community
placements.
ms.
beverly
p.
downing
we
think
that
if
georgia
is
required
to...
to
expand
their
community
placements
by
this
statute--
ms.
beverly
p.
downing
--we
don't
think...
no.
we
don't
think
that
the
statute
requires
georgia
to
have
community
placements.
ms.
beverly
p.
downing
that's
correct.
ms.
beverly
p.
downing
that's
correct.
ms.
beverly
p.
downing
that's
correct.
under
the--
ms.
beverly
p.
downing
--that...
that's
correct.
ms.
beverly
p.
downing
well,
what
we
know
is
that
the
original
integration
regulation
was
promulgated
by
hew
in
1977,
and
that
the
rule...
the
notice
at
that
point
described
it
as
providing
access
to
treatment.
the
examples
that
it
gave
were
that
a
medicaid
provider
would
need
to
make
its
services
available
to
the
handicapped.
for
instance,
a
doctor
would
need
to
have
a
ramp,
a
wheelchair
ramp,
to
get
into
the
facility.
that
was
in
1977.
in
1978,
the...
a
similar
version
was
repromulgated
as
the
coordination
regulation.
and
again,
the
examples
that
were
given
there
did
not
ever
mention
least
restrictive
treatment
or
anything
like
it.
ms.
beverly
p.
downing
we
don't
say
that
the
attorney
general
lacked
authority
to
promulgate
it
in
the
way
that
it
was
interpreted
at
the
time.
what
we
say
is
that
the
interpretation
that
it's
being
given
today,
as
of
1994
in
the
helen
l.
case
for
the
first
time,
is
a
reversal
of
the
prior
interpretation.
ms.
beverly
p.
downing
yes.
ms.
beverly
p.
downing
that's
what
it
boils
down
to,
your
honor,
and
that
the
new
interpretation
of
the
regulation
actually
would
be
precluded
by
the
language
of
the
statute,
which
requires
discrimination
by
reason
of
disability.
it's
our
position
that
discrimination
by
reason
of
disability
applies
to...
requires
even
handed
treatment
of
the
handicapped
relative
to
the
non
handicapped.
that
was
the
primary
focus
of
the
act.
ms.
beverly
p.
downing
we
would
say
no,
that
the--
ms.
beverly
p.
downing
--the
second
group
which
you
posited
needs
a
certain
level
of
treatment,
that
this
level
of
treatment
can
be
provided
appropriately
in
the
hospital
and
that
the
person
can
benefit
from
that
treatment
provided
in
the
hospital.
ms.
beverly
p.
downing
we
wouldn't
say
that
it
renders
irrelevant.
however,
we
would
say
that
the
mere
fact
that
the
person
could
also
be
treated
in
the
community
would
not
make
hospital
treatment
discriminatory.
in
fact,
the
very
structure
of
the
medicaid
act
presumed
that
this
was
the
case,
and
under
the
medicaid
act,
congress
has
always
favored
institutional
treatment
over
community
treatment.
ms.
beverly
p.
downing
well,
i
believe
that--
ms.
beverly
p.
downing
--respectfully
i
believe
that
it
is,
that--
ms.
beverly
p.
downing
--it
presumes
that
the
person's
disability
is
irrelevant
to
their
hospitalization.
ms.
beverly
p.
downing
respectfully
we
would
say
that...
that
the
person's
disability
is...
is
directly
relevant
to
their
hospital
treatment
and
the--
ms.
beverly
p.
downing
--in...
in
an
involuntary
setting,
that
would
be
a
reasonable
reading
of
the
statute,
where
there's
involuntary
treatment
being
provided
or
where
the
person
is
being
confined
against
their
will
involuntarily
and
there
were
no
medical
reason
for
it
and
the
person
were
not
dangerous
to
themselves
or
others,
yes,
that
would
certainly
violate
the
ada.
ms.
beverly
p.
downing
that's
right.
ms.
beverly
p.
downing
well,
it's
the
voluntary...
the
voluntariness
of
it
is
certainly
a
very
key
part
of
it.
ms.
beverly
p.
downing
that...
that's
one...
one
aspect
of
the
argument.
there...
another
aspect
of
the
argument
is
that
the
person
in
the
hospital
can
leave
the
hospital.
this
person
was
not
confined
in
the
hospital,
and
in
fact
she
did
leave
the
hospital
during
the
day
and
received
community
treatment.
ms.
beverly
p.
downing
no.
ms.
beverly
p.
downing
no.
ms.
beverly
p.
downing
no.
excuse
me.
actually
in
fact
she
did
leave...
one
of
these
patients
left
the
hospital
during
the
day
and
then
returned
at
night.
ms.
beverly
p.
downing
it's
also...
that's
also
untrue
under
the
facts
of
this
case.
under
the
facts
of
this
case--
ms.
beverly
p.
downing
--no.
we
would
not
be
saying
that.
if
that
would
actually
reach
what
we
say
would
be
covered
by
the
ada,
which
is
that...
that
services
that
are
available
to
one
class
of
disabled
cannot
be
excluded
from...
by
another
class
based
on
the
disability
itself.
we
would--
ms.
beverly
p.
downing
--no.
ms.
beverly
p.
downing
no.
ms.
beverly
p.
downing
the
state's
position
is
that
if
a
person
were
excluded
from
hospital
treatment
or
community
treatment
by
reason
of
a
disability,
for
example,
if
the
person
had
aids
and
were
prohibited
from
going
into
the
hospital
or
if
were
prohibited
going
into
community
treatment
because
of
that
disability,
that
would
violate
the
ada,
and
that
would
violate
it
under
the
terms
of
the
statute
which
require
that
a
person
not
be
excluded
by
reason
of
disability.
ms.
beverly
p.
downing
well,
your
honor,
i
believe
that
whenever
you
get
into
decisions
about
treatment
of
the
disabled,
every...
every
decision
is
going
to
be
made
by
reason
of
the
person's
disability.
now,
that
does
not
mean
that
every...
every
treatment
decision
is
discriminatory,
and
nor
does
it
mean
that
the
ada
applies.
ms.
beverly
p.
downing
the...
the
person
must
be
qualified
to
receive
the
services.
the
person
must
meet
the
requirements
for
qualification--
ms.
beverly
p.
downing
--no,
the
state
does
not.
the
state
does
not
have
to
treat
all
disabilities
under
the
ada.
ms.
beverly
p.
downing
no.
that
would
not
constitute
discrimination.
ms.
beverly
p.
downing
that
would...
that
would
discriminate,
yes.
ms.
beverly
p.
downing
certainly.
ms.
beverly
p.
downing
well--
ms.
beverly
p.
downing
--your
honor,
in
response
to
an
earlier
point
that
you
made
in
your...
in
what...
in
your
hypothetical,
again
you
referred
to
locked,
that
they're
locked
in
the
room.
in
this
case--
ms.
beverly
p.
downing
--that
they're
not
locked.
ms.
beverly
p.
downing
i
believe
where
the
state
would
disagree
and
the
state's
position
is
different
than
that
is
that
it
cannot
be
assumed
that
because
one
option
is
appropriate...
and
that's
community
care...
that
another
option,
which
is
hospital
care
is
not
appropriate.
now,
congress
has
spoken
quite
clearly
on
this
in
the
medicaid
act.
congress
has
highly
regulated
and
pumped
billions
of
dollars
into
the
institutional
care
of
individuals
and
has
only
allowed
community
care
as
a
pilot
project,
as
a
let's
try
it
out
and
see
how
it
works
project.
the
state
has
to
get
special
permission
under
the
medicaid
act
in
order
to
provide
those
waiver
beds.
ms.
beverly
p.
downing
that's...
that's
correct.
ms.
beverly
p.
downing
i--
ms.
beverly
p.
downing
--i
would
disagree
with
the
last
point.
the
previous
points
from
justice
scalia
and
justice
o'connor
i
think
fairly
state
the
position,
but
that
we
are
excluding
the
person
from
going
to
the
second
room
because
they
have
a
mental
disability
is...
is
not
the
case.
in
fact,
what
georgia
does
is
once
the
person
is
stabilized,
is
they
do
attempt
to
get
them
into
a
community
placement.
ms.
beverly
p.
downing
no.
no,
not
in
any
way.
georgia
does
not
make
it
more
difficult
for
them
to
get
into
the...
the
second
room.
in
fact,
georgia
is
providing
more
and
more
of
these
rooms.
ms.
beverly
p.
downing
yes,
we
do.
ms.
beverly
p.
downing
your
honor,
that--
ms.
beverly
p.
downing
--your
honor,
georgia...
georgia
thinks
it
would
be
inconsistent
to
say
that
georgia
must
provide
as
many
beds
in
the
community,
once
they
have
a
program,
as...
as
there's
demand
for,
and
yet
at
the
same
time
to
say
that
georgia
is
not
required
to
provide
those
beds
in
the
first
place.
ms.
beverly
p.
downing
well,
georgia...
not
under
the
ada.
we
don't
believe
that
georgia
is
required
to
under
the
ada.
ms.
beverly
p.
downing
well,
georgia...
georgia
believes
that
unjustified
disparate
treatment
based
on
disability--
ms.
beverly
p.
downing
--well,
we
don't
believe
that
every
disparate
treatment
is
discrimination.
i
think
this
was...
this
was--
ms.
beverly
p.
downing
--well,
we
believe
that
there
is
justification
for...
for
treating
the
person
in
the
hospital.
there
has
been
justification
for
centralized
treatment
for
policy
reasons
and
for
medical
reasons.
ms.
beverly
p.
downing
and...
and
financial
reasons.
that's...
that's
correct.
there
have
been--
ms.
beverly
p.
downing
--well--
ms.
beverly
p.
downing
--it's
georgia's
position
that
what
the
ada
is
primarily
focused
on
is
evenhanded
treatment
between
the
handicapped
and...
and
the
non
handicapped,
that
to...
it
does
have
some
application
in
disability
services,
but
it
does
not
apply
with
equal
force
in
the
provision
of
disability
services.
the
primary
purpose
of
the
ada
is
to
provide
in
an
evenhanded
way
the
services
that
are
available
without
discrimination
according
to
disability.
the
primary
purpose
is
not
to
require
the
georgia
to
totally
expand
its
community
services
to
meet
all
demand,
which
is
what
the
plaintiffs
are
suggesting.
ms.
beverly
p.
downing
that's...
that's
correct.
that's
correct.
ms.
beverly
p.
downing
it's
georgia's
position
that
it
is
reasonable
for
the
state
to
ask
someone
to
wait
until
a
community
placement
is
available,
that
that
does
not
constitute
discrimination.
it
is
a
fundamental
alteration
of
the
state's
services
to
require
the
state
to
close
down
institutions
and
to
fully
fund--
ms.
beverly
p.
downing
--but
we...
we
think
that
goes
to--
ms.
beverly
p.
downing
--but
we
think
that
also
goes
to
the
issue
of
whether
there's
been
discrimination
in
the
first
instance.
ms.
beverly
p.
downing
no.
if
the
person
has...
meets
the
qualifications
for
the
services,
that
they
can
certainly
access
the
services
when
they're
available.
and
i
would
like--
ms.
beverly
p.
downing
--well,
what
the
eleventh
circuit
did,
however,
is
limit
the
question
on
remand
to
a
comparison
between
the
cost
of
serving
two
persons
in
the
community
relative
to
the
entire
mental
health
budget
of
the
state.
now,
this
is...
this
is
not
a
fair
comparison
when
you
have
2
persons
on
the
numerator
and
160,000
on
the
denominator
as
to
cost.
and
in
fact,
the
district
court
has
already
ruled
on...
on
that
issue
exactly
the
way
the
eleventh
circuit
defined--
ms.
beverly
p.
downing
--absolutely.
absolutely.
the
eleventh
circuit
sent
back
the
question
that
was
always...
will
always
preclude
the
state
from
a
meaningful
defense.
and
i
would--
ms.
beverly
p.
downing
--the...
the
act
by
its
terms...
the
act
by
its
terms...
there's
more
than
one
argument,
obviously,
we
have.
the...
the
act
by
its
terms
we
believe
does
preclude
that
interpretation.
however,
if
you
believe
that
it
does
not
preclude
that
interpretation,
then...
then
we
believe
that
the
justice
department's
interpretation
is
not
entitled
to
deference
because
it's
been
a
total
reversal.
and
i
would
like
to
point
out--
ms.
beverly
p.
downing
--the
justice
department...
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
the
justice
department's
position
has...
has
reversed
in
this
case.
in...
in
the
bowen
case--
ms.
beverly
p.
downing
--yes.
the
helen
l.--
ms.
beverly
p.
downing
--yes,
and
that's
the
first
time,
as
conceded
by
the
attorney
general,
that
they
ever
took
that
position.
prior
to
the
time
the
ada
was
passed,
the...
the
attorney
general
took
the
position
that
section
504
essentially
is
concerned
only
with
discrimination
in
the
relative
treatment
of
handicapped
to
non
handicapped
persons
and
does
not
confer
any
absolute
right
to
receive
particular
services
or
benefits
under
federally
assisted
programs.
ms.
beverly
p.
downing
that
is
from
the
bowen
case.
the
court
cited
the
solicitor
general's
position,
the
exact
language
of
their
brief
in
that
case.
that's
the
position
we
take.
that's
the
position
that
the
solicitor
took
in
that
case.
and
also,
in
their
regulatory
impact
statement,
which
was
issued
after
the
ada
was
passed,
they
took
the
exact
position
which
we're
taking
today,
which
is
that
title
ii
a
essentially
operates
to
extend
the
program
accessibility
standards
of
the
rehabilitation
act
of
1973
to
the
last
small,
remaining
portion
of
the
public
sector
not
covered
by
this
standard.
we
agree
with
that.
we
think
that
the
program
accessibility
of
the
community
services
is
covered
by
the
ada
and
was
covered
by
section
504.
the...
in
the...
that
analysis,
the
