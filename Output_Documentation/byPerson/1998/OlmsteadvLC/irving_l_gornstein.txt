mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
under
the
attorney
general's
integration
regulation,
a
state
that
offers
treatment
to
persons
with
disabilities
must
offer
treatment
in
an
integrated
community
setting
rather
than
a
segregated
institution
when
treatment
in
the
community
would
be
appropriate
to
the
individual's
needs
and
when
it
would
not
require
an
unreasonable
change
in
state
policy
or
a
fundamental
alteration
in
the
state's
treatment
program.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
the
statutory
obligation
only
is
triggered
when
it
is
appropriate
to
treat
the
person
in
the
community.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
in...
in
this
court's
decision
in
arline
i
believe,
which
was
under
section
504
of
the
rehabilitation
act,
provides
the
nearest
analogy,
and
there
the
court
said
that
courts
should
generally
defer
to
reasonable
judgments
made
by
the
state's
treatment
professionals.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
the
attorney
general
has
authority
or
was
compelled
to
issue
regulations--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--yes.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
he
administers
the
act
by
following...
filing
lawsuits
when
there
are
violations
of
the
act.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
well--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--you're
raising
the
question
of
deference.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
in...
this
court's
decision
in
bragdon
said
that
the
attorney
general
was
entitled
to
deference
in
his
interpretation
of
title
iii
in
the...
of
the
ada
based
on
the
very
factors
that
are
present
here,
that
the
attorney
general
was
directed
to
issue
regulations
to--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--justice
scalia,
i
think
you
would
not
be
bound
by
it,
but
i
think
you
would
be
entitled--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--you
would
be...
you
would
be
required
to
give
it
chevron
deference.
now--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--justice
scalia,
i
think
bragdon
does
settle
that
issue,
but
i
also...
it's
also
the
case
that
chevron
itself--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--that
is...
that
is
in
our
brief.
118
s.
ct.
2196,
and...
and
let
me
just
refer
you
to
the
pages
in
our--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--11...
i
just
want
to
give
you
the--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--the
jump
cite
if
i
can.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
no.
i...
i
don't--
[laughter]
justice
scalia,
i...
you
did
not
join
that...
that--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
but...
but
it...
just
to--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--to
respond
to
your...
to
your
question,
chevron
really
has
two
sources
for
deference.
one
is
when
you
delegate
authority
to
administer
the
act,
and
the
other
is
when
you
delegate
authority
specifically
to
issue
regulations.
and
that's
what
we
have
here.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
well,
actually
the...
the
justice
department
has
authority,
for
example,
to
decide
what
drugs
are
classified
and
what
are
not...
not
classified.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
which
seems...
i'm
sorry.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
if
congress
specifically
delegated
authority
to
the
attorney
general
to
do
that,
you
would...
you
would
resolve
that
under
chevron
deference.
let
me
just...
i
don't
want
to--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--well,
there
were
actually
two
different
parts
of--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--there
are
two
different
parts
to
that
decision,
justice
kennedy.
in
the
first
part,
you
talked
about
skidmore
deference,
but
in
the
latter
part
of
the
opinion,
you
talked
about
chevron
deference.
so,
i...
i
would
respectfully
disagree.
i
think
you
did
resolve
it.
but
in
this
case,
you
do
not
have
to
get
into
the
issue
of
deference
because
in
the
text
of
the
act,
congress
made
specific
findings
that
segregation
and
isolation
are
forms
of
discrimination,
and
that
discrimination
persists
in
such
areas
as
institutionalization.
those
findings
demonstrate
that
congress
understood
that
unjustified
segregation
of
persons
with
disabilities
to
be
a
form
of
discrimination
prohibited
by
the
ada.
congress
also
specifically
directed
the
attorney
general
to
issue
regulations
that
are
consistent
with
section
504
of
the
rehabilitation
act,
the
coordination
regulations,
and
one
of
those
regulations
specifically
requires
all
services
to
be
provided
in
the
most
integrated--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--the
principle
that
is
at
issue
here
is
that
you
must
afford
treatment
in
the
most
integrated
setting,
but
that
is
qualified
by
the
treatment
has
to
be
appropriate
and
it
does
not
have
to...
it
cannot
require
an
unreasonable
change
in
state
policy
or
a
fundamental--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--the
regulation
has--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--in...
in...
at...
it
does
in...
in
10a
of
our
appendix.
you
have
to
read
two
regulations
together.
d
is
the
basic
integration
obligation
which
says
that
a
public
entity
shall
administer
services,
programs,
and
activities
in
the
most
integrated
setting
appropriate
to
the
needs
of
qualified
individuals.
but
then
look
above
on
number
7.
it
is
subject
to
that
regulation,
which
says
that
a
public
entity
shall
make
reasonable
modifications
in
policies
and
so
on
unless
it's
a
fundamental
alteration.
and
what
that
regulation
reflects
is
that
it
has
never
been
the
case
under
section
504
or
the
ada
that
in
order
to
comply
with
them,
a
state
would
have
to
make
fundamental
alterations
or
unreasonable
changes
in
policy.
that
was
clear
under
this
court's
decision
in
southeastern
community
college
v.
davis
and
in
alexander
v.
choate,
and
this
regulation
carries
that
principle
over.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
we
regard
that
as
a
fundamental
change
in
the
way
services
would
be
delivered,
and
therefore
a
state
would
not
have
an
obligation
to
do
that--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--that
would
depend
on
whether
that
imposed
unreasonable
costs
on
the
states
or
whether
it
reflected
a
fundamental
change
in
the
way
that
the
state
was
providing
services.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
one
on
one
care
strikes
us
as
an
issue
that
ought
to
be
resolved
in
light
of
whether
it
is
an
unreasonable
additional
expense.
and
the
benchmark
for
looking
at
that
is
in
the...
title
i
on
page
2a
of
our
brief
says
in
general,
undue
hardship
means
requiring
significant
expense.
and
then
it
goes
on
to
give
a
number
of
factors
that
a
court
should
consider
in
deciding
whether
it
is
a
significant
expense.
now,
you
cannot
develop
a
bright
line
rule,
but
that
shows
the
guidance
that
should
be
followed
in
deciding
whether
one
on
one
care
reflects
an
unreasonable
expense.
you
look
at
the
nature
of
the
cost,
the
overall
financial
resources
of
the
facilities
involved,
the--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--this
is
the
statute,
mr.
chief
justice.
