mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
enacting
the
ada,
congress
declared
that
its
overriding
goal
was
to
remove
barriers
that
were
preventing
persons
with
disabilities
from
gaining
access
to
the
economic
and
social
mainstream
of
american
life.
to
that
end,
congress
catalogued
on
the
face
of
the
statute
a
number
of
practices
that
it
thought
was
impeding
that
access,
and
it
called
these...
and
this
is
a
quote
from
the
statute...
forms
of
discrimination.
first
on
the
list
was
the
isolation
and
segregation
of
persons
with
disability
from
the
social
mainstream
of
american
life.
and
the
legislative
history
is
clear
that
what
congress
had
in
mind
in
putting
that
first
on
the
list
and
referring
to
institutionalization
as
one
of
the
places
where
there
are
serious
and
pervasive
problems
to
be
addressed
was
the
unnecessary
confinement
of
persons
with
mental
disabilities.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
it's
i
think
not
dependent
at
all.
the
legislative
history
confirms
what
appears
in
the
text
of
the
statute,
and
to
show
that,
your
honor,
i
would
propose
to
look
solely
at
the
text
first.
the
text
recites
isolate
and
segregate
as
a
pervasive
form
of
discrimination.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
well,
your
honor,
the
argument
that
this
is
voluntary,
we
provide
the
service,
we
happen
to
provide
it
in
the
locked
ward
of
a
mental
institution--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
--you
don't
have
to
take
the
service,
but
if
you
would
like
the
service,
the
only
place
you
can
have
it
is
here.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
yes,
we
do,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
no,
that's
not
accurate,
your
honor,
and
let
me
be
clear
about
what
the
record
shows.
one
of
these
petitioners
did
try
from
time
to
time
to
leave,
to
go
out
into
the
community.
she
was
taken
by
the
police
and
brought
back.
under
georgia
law,
even
if
you
are
a
voluntary,
that
is,
not
a
statutorily
committed
person,
but
a
voluntary
entrant
into
this
institution,
you
are
not
free
to
leave
at
will
to
come
and
go.
you
can
apply
for
release
and
the
state
will
be
obliged
to
release
you
after
72
hours,
but
you
are--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
--totally,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
totally.
these
were
locked
wards.
there's--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
--she
could--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
--yes.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
that's
right.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
she
was
free
to
leave
and
would
not
receive
any
of
the
services
that
she
needed.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
immediately
before
suit
was
filed,
for
a
period
of
a
few
weeks.
that's
correct.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
that's
correct.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
one
of
them
was
living
in
a
place
with
several
full
time
attendants
for
a
very
brief
time,
but
then
that
was
withdrawn.
but
let
me
talk--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
--no.
it's
actually
cheaper.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
well,
it's
cheaper,
your
honor,
and
i...
i
do
want
to
spend
a
minute
on
why
it's
cheaper.
actually
it
may
be
important
to
define
what
the
service
here.
the
service
is
not
housing,
and
the...
the
housing,
whether
in
the
institution
or
in
a
community
facility
is
paid
for
by
the
patient
out
of
social
security
disability
checks.
that's
not
the
service.
the
service
that's
being
provided
here
is
what
is
generally
called
habilitation.
it
is
a
form
of
training
and
supervision.
people
with
developmental
disabilities
need
to
learn
how
to
do
a
variety
of
things
in
order
to
function
independently
in
society.
that's
an
educational
function.
while
they
are
learning
that
and
until
they
have
achieved
the
capacity
to
perform
on
their
own
in
society,
they
need
a
certain
modicum
of
supervision
as
well.
and
so,
the
service
is
a
people
provided
service.
there
is
no
dispute...
and
georgia
concedes
that
it
is
cheaper
to
provide
that
service
to
people
in
community--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
--pardon?
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
yes.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
correct.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
well,
the
first
reassurance
is
that
in
this
case
the
state's
own
professionals
said
that
these
people
could
appropriately
be
served
in
the
community.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
and
the
question
is,
to
what
extent
would
deference
be
owed
to
the
state
medical
professionals
in
cases
where,
unlike
this
one,
they
said,
we
don't
think
this
person
can
be
appropriately
served
in
the
community?
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
we
would
say
yes,
your
honor.
we're
not
clear
whether
the
solicitor
general
would
say
yes.
and
let
me
explain
why.
the
applicable
regulation,
which
congress
virtually
dictated
that
the
attorney
general
adopt
says,
a
public
entity
shall
administer
services
in
the
most
integrated
setting
appropriate
to
the
needs
of
qualified
individuals.
now,
we
would
concede
the
state
doesn't
have
to
provide
services
at
all.
nothing
in
the
ada
says
you
have
to
provide
mental
disability
services.
but
what
the
statute
and
what
this
regulation
that
congress
dictates
says
is
if
you
choose
to
provide
the
services,
you
must
provide
them
to
individuals
in
the
most
integrated
setting
appropriate
to
their
needs.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
well,
your
honor,
if
one...
one
can
definitionally
negate
entirely
this
provision.
if
one
does
that--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
--it
is
not,
and
the
state
has
not
argued
that
the
service
in
this
case
is
institutionalization.
the
service
is
the
habilitation
that
the
people
need.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
the
question
is
where
it's
going
to
be
provided
and
that's
what--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
--yes,
i
would
like
to,
your
honor.
there
really
are
two
separate
questions
i
think.
one,
will
the
courts
override
the
judgments
of
the
state's
own
professionals,
which
i
understood
to
be
justice
breyer's
first
question.
there,
this
case
doesn't
present
the
question,
but
there
is
a
question
of
the
degree
of
deference
that
this
court
will
accord
to
the
judgment
of
the
state's
professionals.
and
this
court
is
in
control
of
that
when
such
a
case
is
presented
where
the
patient
says,
i
can
be
appropriately
served
outside,
but
the
institution
says,
no,
we
don't
agree.
here
they
did
agree.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
the
statute
does
not
say
how
the
determination
will
be
made.
this
court
has,
in
interpreting
other
statutes,
said
that
in
deciding
a
question
like
this,
we
accord
such
deference
as
we
think
is
appropriate
to
them.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
well,
this
court--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
--i
hope
not.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
well,
your
honor,
on
this
issue
i
find
it
hard
to
be
arguing.
and
in
our
case
the
state's
professionals
say
not
only
can
these
people
appropriately
be
served
in
the
community,
they
can
be
better
served
in
the
community
for
obvious
reasons.
if
habilitation
is
designed
to
train
them
to
function
in
the
community,
it's
easier
to
give
that
training
if
they're
in
the
community.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
well--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
--that's
correct.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
well,
this
court
has
in
other
cases
said,
we
will
give
very
strong
deference
to
the
judgment
of
the...
the
institution's
professionals,
said
that
in
a
different
context,
not
the
ada,
in
youngberg
v.
romeo.
it
said
in--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
--true.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
we
are
not
saying
that,
your
honor.
that
is
addressed
in
the...
in
the
brief
for
the
united
states.
georgia
identified
in
1992
that
it
had
532
such
persons,
persons
in
institutions
who
didn't
need
to
be
there,
and
georgia
was
saying
to
them,
you
can
have
this
service
but
only
if
you'll
agree
to
stay
in
this
locked
institution.
now--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
--well,
on
the
first
score,
your
honor,
this
court
in
both
youngberg
and
in
an
8...
504
case
arline,
which
also
talked
about
deference
to
the
state's
professionals,
said
it
has
to
be
professional
judgment
that
we
defer
to,
not
administrative
judgment.
if
a
hospital
administrator
says,
hey,
i
like
being
the
administrator
of
a
great,
big
hospital,
so
i'm
going
to
overrule
the
judgment
of
the
professionals,
i
want
to
keep
these
people
in
an
institution,
even
though
they
don't
need
to
be
here,
that
would
not
be
something
that
would
warrant
deference.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
well,
your
honor,
i'd
like
to
think
states
do
better
than
that,
and
i
think
they
do.
that
is,
this
state
has
identified
lots
of
people
who
don't
need
to
be
in
institutions.
now,
this
business
about--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
--well,
this
court
in
arline,
which
was
a
504
case,
said
that
we
give
very
strong
deference
to
the
views
of
the
state's
professionals.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
yes.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
unless...
there's
no
presumption
unless
the
state's
own
professionals
say--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
--that's
right.
that's
correct.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
correct.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
well--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
--well,
certainly
those
three,
that
is
to
say,
that
even
if
all
professionals'
judgments
are
to
be
given
equal
deference
by
the
court,
the
plaintiff,
by
virtue
of
having
the
burden
of
proof...
i
can
appropriately
be
served
in
the
community...
would
have
to
be
more
persuasive
than
the
state.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
well,
the...
in
the...
in
adopting
the
regulations,
the
attorney
general
gave
us
a
definition
of
what
that
means,
and
it's
printed
on
page
21
of
our
brief.
an
integrated
setting,
within
the
meaning
of
this
provision,
is
a
setting
that
enables
individuals
with
disabilities
to
interact
with
nondisabled
persons
to
the
fullest
extent
possible.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
probably
not.
i
think
the
answer
is
almost
surely
not,
your
honor,
because
it
would
be
able
to
satisfy
the
fundamental
alteration
defense;
that
is,
it
would
not
be
a
reasonable
accommodation
to
serve
that
person
in
the
community.
the
cost
would
be
too
great.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
it
would,
indeed,
but--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
--that's
correct,
but
there
is
a
limit
in
the
statute
on
the--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
--well,
it
could
well
because
it
is...
before
you
get
to
whether
it's
a
fundamental
alteration,
you
have
to
ask
is
this
a
reasonable
accommodation
because
b(7)
of
the
reg
says,
a
public
entity
shall
make
reasonable
modifications
in
policies
and
practices
to
avoid--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
--discrimination.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
well,
the
state's
obligation
here
is
to...
if
it
is
going
to
provide
these
services,
is
to
provide
integrated
settings.
that
is,
what
georgia
is
doing
is
it's
treating
this
as
though
the
availability
of
community
services
is
out
of
their
control.
we
can't
help
it.
there
are
only
this
many
community
services,
so
people
will
have
to
wait
in
line.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
well,
it
doesn't
have
to
get
everybody
out,
your
honor.
if
it
gets
a
few
people
out,
it
can
reduce
the
number
of
personnel.
the
fact
is
that
it
is
much,
much
cheaper
to
provide
these
services
in
the
community.
georgia
repeatedly
acknowledges
that.
now,
it
does
say...
but
it
has
not
yet
proved...
and
we
don't
believe
that
it
can
prove...
that,
yes,
it
is
much
cheaper
to
serve
them
in
the
community,
but
we
still
have
to
bear
the
same
costs
of
the
institution
even
if
the
bed
is
empty.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
of
course.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
well,
they
were
allowed
to
demonstrate
that
it
would
be
a
burden,
an
undue
burden,
and
therefore
a
fundamental
alteration
to
serve
these
two
people
in
the
community,
and
they
said,
we
concede
that
we
cannot
make
that
showing.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
that
is
correct.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
that's
correct.
the
state--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
--that's
right.
it's
even
easier
than
that,
and
even
when
we
agree,
when
our
professionals
agree
that
they
can
be
appropriately
served
outside.
so,
they're
saying,
even
if
it's
true,
that
there
would
be
no
burden
whatsoever
on
us.
