ms.
downing,
just
to
clarify
the
dimensions
of
this
case,
do
i
understand
correctly
that
you
are
saying
these
two
women
are
appropriately
placed
as
far
as
medical
needs
are
concerned
in
a
community
based
facility?
so,
it's
not
that
they
need
the
institution.
you're
not
challenging
that
on
the
facts,
but
you're
saying
they
must
wait
their
turn
on
line.
is
that...
is
that
your
position?
or
are
you
saying
they
may
not
qualify
for
community
based
facilities?
unknown
speaker
your
position
is...
is
as
i...
if
i
understand
it
correctly,
is...
is
much
further
than
that.
i...
i
understood
it
to
be
that
it's
up
to
the
state
to
decide
what
voluntary
facilities
it
will
make
available
for
the...
for
the
mentally
ill,
that
if
the
state
chooses
to
have
only
institutional
facilities,
it
may
do
that.
and
if
it
chooses
to
have,
in
addition,
community
based
facilities,
it
may
have
them
in
addition,
but
it
will
be
up
to
the
state
how
many
people
it
will
put
in
those...
allow
to
go
into
those
community
based
facilities,
because
we're
talking
here
about
voluntary
admissions.
right?
unknown
speaker
i'm
not
saying
whether
there
are.
do
you
think
georgia
is
required
to
have
community
placements
by
this
statute?
unknown
speaker
that's
not
the
question
i
asked.
is
georgia
required
to
have
community
placements?
unknown
speaker
i
didn't
think
you
said
that.
okay.
unknown
speaker
now,
could...
as
i
understand
it,
the
act
provides
that
the
attorney
general
will
promulgate
regulations,
and
it
goes
on
to
say
that
those
regulations
will
be
consistent
with
the
disabilities
act
and
with
regulations
promulgated
under
section
504
of
the
rehabilitation
act.
is
that
right?
unknown
speaker
and
there
was
a
regulation
adopted
under
section
504
saying
that
no
otherwise
qualified
handicapped
individual
would
be
excluded
from
participation
and/or
denied
the
benefits
of
or
subjected
to
discrimination,
and
that
services
had
to
be
provided
in
the
most
integrated
setting
appropriate
to
the
needs.
is
that
true
under
the
rehab
act?
unknown
speaker
and
the
same
regulation
was
then
adopted
by
the
attorney
general
under
the
disabilities
act.
unknown
speaker
is
there
any
definition
of
integrated
setting?
do
we
know
what
that
is?
unknown
speaker
well,
this...
do
you
challenge
the
regulation
that
was
adopted
by
the
attorney
general,
or
do
you
challenge
the
interpretation
of
that
regulation?
do
you
say
that
the
attorney
general
lacked
authority
to
adopt
that
regulation?
unknown
speaker
well,
so
what
this
case
actually
turns
on,
when
you
sort
all
other
things
around
it,
is
the
meaning
of
the
regulation
saying
it
must
be
in
the
most
integrated
setting
appropriate.
is
that
right?
unknown
speaker
is
that
what
it
boils
down
to?
unknown
speaker
may...
may
i
ask
you
about
that?
because
it
seems
to
me
that
your
argument
in
this
respect
assumes
that
there
is
some
kind
of
uniform
and
unvarying
class
of
persons
who
are
handicapped.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
that
is
not
so.
there
are
all
sorts
of
handicaps.
there
are
handicaps
of
all
sorts
of
degrees,
and...
and
recognizing
the
degree
that
is
involved,
let...
let
me
put
this
question
to
you
and
ask
you
to...
to
explain
your
position
in
relation
to
it.
let's
assume
that
there
is
a
class
of
handicapped
persons
who,
because
of
their
handicaps,
are
simply
unsuited
to
live
outside
of
an
institution.
assume
secondly
that
there
are
a
group
of
handicapped
individuals
who
can
perfectly
well
live
outside
the
institution
despite
the
handicap.
and,
of
course,
assume,
three,
there's
a
general
population
of
people
who
don't
live
in
institutions.
if
the
government
treats
the
second
group,
those
whose
handicaps
are
irrelevant
to
institutionalization,
the
same
way
it
treats
the
first
group,
those
who
have
to
live
in
institutions
because
of
the
handicap,
isn't
that...
and
they
do
so
on
the
grounds
that
there
is
a
handicap,
even
though
it
does
not
require
institutionalization,
in
that
case
isn't
the
government
engaging
in
the
discrimination
on
the
basis
of
handicap
to
the...
in...
in
relation
to
the
second
group?
unknown
speaker
why
not?
unknown
speaker
so,
you're
saying
that
if
hospitalization
would
provide
some
appropriate
treatment,
that
in
effect
renders
irrelevant
the
fact
that
an
individual
can
live
outside
the
institution
and
presumably
get
the
treatment
on
a...
on
a
day
care
basis
or
something
of
that
sort.
that's
basically
your
argument.
unknown
speaker
well,
do
you
accept
the
position,
just
as
a
matter
of
statutory
interpretation,
that...
i'll
assume
for...
for
my
question
that
your...
your
answer
gives
one
version
of...
of
what
might
be
regarded
as
discrimination.
i'll...
i'll
accept
your
answer
as
a...
as
a
possible
interpretation.
do
you
also
take
the
position
that
your
interpretation
is
the
only
possible
way
of
construing
discrimination
within
the
statute?
in
other
words,
do
you
say
that...
although
your
answer
is
a
legitimate
one,
do
you
also
say
that
in
my
hypothesis
it...
it
simply
would
not
be
a
legitimate
interpretation
of
the
statute
to
say
on
my
hypothesis
that
there
was
discrimination
because
the
middle
group
was
treated
like
the
first,
not
the
third?
is...
is
my
interpretation
impossible?
unknown
speaker
or
unreasonable?
unknown
speaker
why
is
it
unreasonable?
unknown
speaker
well,
that's
right.
that's
the
hypothesis
of...
of
the
very
question.
unknown
speaker
well,
in
other
words,
you're
changing
my
question.
but
my...
let's...
let's
just
stick
to
my
question
for
a
minute.
assuming
there
is
this
middle
group
of
individuals
who
have
handicaps
in
some
respect
but
whose
handicaps
do
not
require
hospitalization
any
more
than
i
require
hospitalization
or
you
do,
assuming
there
is
such
a
middle
group,
would
it
be
a
possible
reading
of
the
statute,
a
reasonable
reading
of
the
statute
to
say
that
the
government
discriminates
against
them
when
it
says
we're
going
to
put
you
in
the
hospital
anyway,
even
though
you
don't
have
to
be
there?
is
that
a
possible...
possibly
reasonable
reading
of
the
statute?
unknown
speaker
but--
--it
would
violate
the
constitution.
you
wouldn't
need
the
ada
to
prevent
that
from--
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
but
the...
the
voluntary
character
of
the
hospitalization
then
is
what...
what
takes
us
out
of...
of
the
situation
that
you
and
i
have
just
been
describing?
unknown
speaker
but
is...
is
that...
does
the...
does
the
voluntariness,
in
effect,
negate
the
possibility
of
discrimination
on
the
argument
that,
look,
if
they're
doing
this
voluntarily,
you
can't
say
that
the
government
is
discriminating
against
them
because
they
themselves
are
responsible
for
the...
for
the
treatment
that
they're
receiving.
is...
is
that
the
nub
of
the
argument?
unknown
speaker
well,
but
their
point
was
that
if
they
left
the
hospital,
then
they...
under
your
scheme,
they
couldn't
get
any
treatment
at
all.
unknown
speaker
wasn't
that
their--
unknown
speaker
--wasn't
that
their
point?
unknown
speaker
no.
i
meant
if
she
left
the
hospital
permanently.
if
she
said,
i
don't
want
to
stay
in
the
hospital
at
all.
unknown
speaker
what
we're
trying
to
do
is
to
test
what
your
legal
theory
is,
and
it's
still
not
quite
clear
to
me.
suppose
you
have
a
classification
of
disabled
people
who
are
partially
paralyzed
and
need
catheterization
during
the
day.
they
need
some
fairly
constant
care,
but
it
is
provided
and
can
be
provided
in
an
integrated
setting.
assume
that.
then
assume
that
the
state
says,
any
blind
person
is
ineligible
for
this
integrated
treatment
and
must
remain
in
a
hospital.
is...
is
that
a
permissible
judgment?
it
seems
to
me
that
you
are
saying
that
it
is.
unknown
speaker
i
thought
that's
what
the
respondents
were
saying.
unknown
speaker
and
if
you
say,
well--
unknown
speaker
--there
are...
there
are
reasons
why
they
should
be
in
the
hospital
because
it's
involuntary
medication
sometimes
in
some
context,
then
that's
quite
different.
i
thought
that
you
were
saying
that
the
state
has
the
capacity
to
decide
what
kind
of
treatment
it
will
grant
to
discrete
kinds
of
disabilities,
and
if
hospital
treatment
is
in...
in
a
sense
excessive
treatment,
so
be
it.
the
state
can
make
that
distinction
disability
by
disability.
that's
the
way
i
read
your
brief.
unknown
speaker
i
guess
the
person
who's
not
admitted
to
the
hospital
because
the
state
determines
that
the
condition
is
not
serious
enough
to
be
treated
in
the
hospital
is
not
being
discriminated
against
because
of
his
disability.
he's
being
discriminated
against
because
of
his
lack
of
disability,
isn't
he?
unknown
speaker
no,
but
he's
not...
he's
being
excluded
from...
from
institutional
treatment
in
the
hypothetical
i
gave
you
not
because
of
the
disability
he
has,
but
because
he
does
not
have
an
additional
disability.
right?
unknown
speaker
does
the
state
have
to
treat
all
disabilities?
unknown
speaker
now,
does
it
therefore
discriminate
against
people
on
the
basis
of
their
disability
if
it
offers
no
treatment
for...
i
don't
know...
dyslexia?
unknown
speaker
if
it
says
half
the
people
who
have
dyslexia
have
to
sit
at
a
special
table,
i
guess
that
would
be
discrimination,
wouldn't
it?
we
have
the
special
dyslexic
table
or
we
have
the
special
table
where
all
the
people
who
want
to
eat
in
the
state
cafeteria
who
are
in
wheelchairs
have
to
sit.
is
that
discrimination?
unknown
speaker
all
right.
now,
if
that's
so,
then
suppose
you
said
all
the
people
who
have
broken
legs
or
whatever,
if
they
want
library
books,
they
have
to
go
to
a
special
room
where
we
lock
them
up
overnight.
i
mean,
that's
clearly
wrong.
unknown
speaker
all
right.
now,
what's...
what
they're
saying
i
think
is
that
a
person
who
clearly
shouldn't
receive
treatment
for
a
mental
disability
in
that
special
room,
it's
just
as
much
discrimination
to
lock
them
up
in
the
special
room
as
if
they
went
there
to
get
library
books
because,
after
all,
there's
no
relation
to
being
in
that
special
room
and
their
mental
disability.
unknown
speaker
it's...
there's
no
medical
reason
for
putting
them
there.
there's
no
more
medical
reason
for
putting
them
there
than
there
is
a
medical
reason
for
putting
a
person
with
a
broken
leg
there.
and
if
there's
no
medical
reason
for
putting
them
there,
why
is
it
any
different
to
say
you
get
mental
treatment
in
that
room
than
to
say
you
get
library
books
in
that
room?
there's
no
relationship
between
the
nature
of
the
room
and
the
treatment
that's
being
handed
out.
at
least,
that's
how
i
understood
it.
i
may
not
understand
it
fully,
but
that
was
my
understanding.
where
there's
no
relation
between
the
treatment
and
being
in
the
special
room,
you
can
no
more
keep
the
mentally
ill
person
there
than
you
could
a
person
who
wanted
any
other
kind
of
service.
unknown
speaker
i'll
assume
they're
not.
unknown
speaker
let's
just
call...
just
call
it
a
special
room,
and
by
that
we'll
mean
an
institutionalized
room.
unknown
speaker
ms.
downing,
do
you
have
a
special
room
for
broken
legged
people?
i
mean,
is...
is
that
the
proper
analogy?
i
thought
you
had
one
room
for
everybody,
and
that
what's
going
on
here
is
that
this
person
is
saying,
i
don't
really
want
this
one
room.
i
can
be
treated
better
somewhere
else.
you
haven't
established
one
room
for
broken
legged
people
or
for
people
with
a
certain
type
of
disability,
have
you?
you've
said,
if
you
want
to
get
library
books,
this
is
where
library
books
are
given
out.
unknown
speaker
and
here
you
have
plaintiffs
who
say,
i
don't
want
to
come
into
this
one
room.
i
can
get
library
books,
given
my...
the
nature
of
my
disability,
in
a...
in
a
bigger
room
with
more
windows
or
something.
and
you're
just
saying,
i'm
sorry,
we...
we
don't
have
a
bigger
room
with
more
windows.
everybody
who
needs
library
books
has
to
come
to
this
room.
but
i
thought
in
this
case
you
had
two
rooms.
you
have
the
room
without
windows
and
the
room
with
windows.
and
the
person
is
saying,
i'm
entitled
to
go
to
the
one
with
windows.
and
you
are
saying
there
not
only
because
they
have
a
mental
illness.
that's...
that's
how
i
understand
your
case.
unknown
speaker
now,
tell
us
if
the
case
is--
unknown
speaker
--well,
are
you
putting
some
extra
barriers?
are
you
making
it
more
difficult
to
get
to
that--
unknown
speaker
--what
if
there's
no
space?
you're
saying
they
have
to
wait
in
line.
right?
unknown
speaker
but
you...
you
assert
you
could
eliminate
the
second
room
entirely
if
you
wanted
to,
if...
if
you
decide
that
the
way
the
state
wants
to
provide
treatment
is...
is
institutionally,
you're...
you're
authorized
to
do
that.
unknown
speaker
i
thought
you
said
that.
is...
is
this
a
new
question?
i
thought
we
answered
that
earlier.
unknown
speaker
which
is
your
position,
that
you're
not
required
to
provide
community
service
at
all.
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
you
a
question
about
the
meaning
of
the
word
discrimination?
it
seems
to
me
that
the
argument...
your
position
is
discrimination
means
disparate
treatment,
treated
differently.
it
seems
to
me
your
opponents
say
discrimination
means
unjustified
disparate
treatment.
am
i
correct
in
describing
the...
the
positions
of
the
parties?
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
discrimination
just
means
unjustified
disparate
treatment,
or
do
you
say
every
disparate
treatment
is
discrimination?
what
is...
what
is
your
view
of--
unknown
speaker
--well,
if
it's
unjustified
disparate
treatment
that
constitute
discrimination
and
if
there's
no
justification
for
keeping
a
person
in
the
second
room
instead
of
the
first,
why
doesn't
the
statute
apply?
unknown
speaker
but
then--
--and
i
thought
financial
reasons.
i
thought
you
said
you
don't
have
enough
money
to
have
too
many
community--
unknown
speaker
--but...
but...
if...
if
you
factor
in
the
fact
that
it's
medically
reasonable
and
preferable
to...
which
is
what
the
implication
of
your
suggestion
is,
to
treat
in
a
hospital,
then
this
whole
case
goes
away.
i...
i
think
we
have
to
take
the
case
on
the
assumption
that
the
treatment
can
be
just
as
effective
in
the
integrated
setting
as
it
in...
as
it
is
in
the
hospital.
if
you
say
it's
more
effective
and...
and
you
can
only
provide
the
most
effective
treatment
there,
then
it's
a
different
case.
unknown
speaker
what
we're
trying
to
do
is
to
find
out
what
is
the
issue
you're
asking
us
to
decide,
and
it
seems
the
parties
are...
the
briefs
are
not
meeting
the
way
you're...
you're
presenting
the
case.
unknown
speaker
yes.
ms.
downing,
let
me
remind
you
and
my
colleagues
the...
the
question
presented
in
the
petition
for
certiorari,
whether
the
public
services
portion
of
the
federal
ada
compels
the
state
to
provide
treatment
and
habilitation
for
mentally
disabled
persons
in
a
community
placement
when
appropriate
treatment
and
habilitation
can
also
be
provided
to
them
in
a
state
mental
institution.
unknown
speaker
well,
it's
correct
because
that's
the
question
you
presented.
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
well,
that
issue
is
open
on
remand
i
assume.
unknown
speaker
whether
it's
a
fundamental
alteration
of
the
state's
program.
unknown
speaker
can
you
make
that
wait
longer
for
the
mentally
ill
than
for
other
disabilities?
unknown
speaker
ms.
downing,
i
thought
this
case
had
gone
back
on
remand
to
decide
the
financial,
whatever
it
was,
question--
unknown
speaker
--you
say
the
eleventh
circuit
sent
back
the
wrong
question.
unknown
speaker
why...
i
opened
with
this
question
and...
and
if
i'm
wrong
about
it,
do
tell
me.
i
thought
the
state's
current
position
is,
yes,
we
think
there
ought
to
be
two
rooms.
we
have
two
rooms,
but
people
have
to
stand
on
line
because
we
don't...
the
second
room
isn't
large
enough.
i
thought
that
was
the
position
you
were
taking
now
and
that
that's
compatible
with
the
act.
unknown
speaker
a
total
reversal
of...
of
what?
unknown
speaker
reversed
from
what?
because
i'm
looking
at
their
brief
and...
what
was
it?
the
helen
l.
case?
unknown
speaker
and
they
say
the
unnecessary
segregation
of
individuals
with
disabilities
is
a
form
of
discrimination
prohibited
by
the
ada
and
its
implementing
regulations.
unknown
speaker
where
is
that
from?
unknown
speaker
there's
no
time
left
and
no
further
questions.
[laughter]
mr.
gottesman.
unknown
speaker
how
dependent
is
your
argument,
mr.
gottesman,
on
what
you
describe
as
the
legislative
history?
unknown
speaker
this
isn't...
i
mean,
this
doesn't...
this
isn't
isolation
or
segregation.
it
is
the
state
offering
certain
treatment
services.
it
says
this
is
the
treatment
service
that
we
have.
that's
quite
different
from
saying,
you
know,
people
in
wheelchairs
have
to
be
in
a
separate
part
of
the
room.
it
just
happens
that
this
is
the
only
service
we
provide.
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
well,
now,
in
this
case
we
do
not
have
a
locked
ward.
unknown
speaker
well,
according
to
counsel
for
the
petitioner,
these
particular
individuals
were
permitted
to
leave,
or
at
least
one
of
them,
during
the
day
and
return
at
night.
unknown
speaker
so,
you
disagree
with
the
description
given
by
counsel
for
the
petitioner
of
the--
unknown
speaker
--conditions.
unknown
speaker
they
were
locked,
but
to
say
it's
locked
is
not
to
say
that
it's
involuntary.
she
could
get
out
at
any
time
that
she
wanted.
unknown
speaker
it
took
72
hours.
unknown
speaker
she
had
to
give
them
72
hours'
notice
that
i
no
longer
want
to
be
here--
unknown
speaker
--whereupon
she
was
free
to
leave.
unknown
speaker
and
one...
one
of
these...
one
of
these...
respondents
was...
was
in...
in
a
community
location
for
some
time,
wasn't
she?
unknown
speaker
paid
for
by
the
state.
unknown
speaker
and...
and
it
took...
it
took
a
full
time
person
living
with
her
to
make
that
treatment
effective.
wasn't
one
of
them
living
with
a
full
time
attendant?
unknown
speaker
i
mean,
that's
pretty
expensive.
i--
unknown
speaker
--i
guess
that's
community
treatment,
but
it's
pretty
expensive.
unknown
speaker
in
a
way
that's
what's
bothering
me--
unknown
speaker
--is
if
i
say
what
is...
maybe
you
can
say
something
to
reassure
me.
what
bothers
me
is
this,
that
in
the
apa
brief,
they
say
without
deinstitutionalization
there
would
be
800,000
people
in
institutions,
but
there
are
only
about
76,000.
well,
many
of
those
76,000
must
really
need
to
be
in
institutions.
unknown
speaker
and
so,
what
worries
me
about
your
position
is
writing
something
that,
as
it
really
works
out
in
the
world,
leads
a
lot
of
the
people
who
need
to
be
in
institutions
to
be
out,
abandoned
in
the
streets.
now,
the
reason
that
that
is
possible
in
my
mind
is
because
once
you
say
the
law
requires
you
to
put
people
in
halfway
houses,
if
you
say
that's
appropriate,
but
appropriate
is
a
term
that
we
want
medical
people
to
decide,
not
judges.
unknown
speaker
and
so,
i'm
suddenly
worried
in
areas
of
uncertainty,
like
your
clients
here
who
have
been
in
and
out
because
they
had
threats
to
kill
themselves
or
others
from
time
to
time,
and
then
sometimes...
that's
the
real
world.
sometimes
they're
in,
sometimes
they're
out.
it's
serious,
complicated,
technical
and
fluctuates.
and
on
your
side,
can
you
say
something
to
assure
me
that...
that
if
you
won,
that
wouldn't
suddenly
lead
to
a
lot
of
people
being
thrown
out
of
institutions
who
ought
to
be
there?
unknown
speaker
it's
the
rule
of
law
that
i
fear--
unknown
speaker
--can
we
go
back
one
step
to
have
this
clear,
this
basic
question
clear?
in
your
view,
under
the
statute,
is
the
state
required
to
have
any
community
based
facilities?
suppose
the
state
says,
some
people
we
know
are
going
to
need
institutionalization.
we're
going
to
provide
just
the
one
room.
is
there
any
obligation
under
the
ada
for
the
state
to
do
more
than
have
institutional
care?
unknown
speaker
may
i--
--but--
--services
are.
i
think
if
the
state
would
say,
here
are
the
services...
is...
is
an
institution
for
people
who
want...
and...
and
that
institution
has
to
be
as
integrated
as
possible.
you
can't
make
people
in
wheelchairs
sit
at
one...
at
one
end
of
the
room.
but
the
service
is
an
institution
for
treatment
of
these
people.
unknown
speaker
i
don't
think
that
negates
it
entirely.
you
cannot
segregate
people
in
wheelchairs.
unknown
speaker
mr.
gottesman--
unknown
speaker
--may
i
ask,
if
you've
finished
your
answer
to
justice
breyer's
question,
because
i'm
also
concerned
about
the
possibility
that
if
we
adopt
the
rule
in
its
strongest
form
that
you
advocate,
that
the
states,
in
order
to
avoid
the
risk
of
liability,
would
have
a
motive
and
an
incentive
to
push
people
out
into
the
community
that
should
not
go
in
that
direction.
so,
would
you
finish
your
answer
to
that?
unknown
speaker
where
do
we
get
the
deference
to
professionals
out
of
the
statute?
unknown
speaker
but
it
won't
be
the
patient
against
the
state's
professionals.
it
will
be
the
patient's
professionals
against
the
state's
professionals.
i
don't
know
any
other
area
where
we
say
when
there's
a
battle
of
experts,
the
state
always
wins.
unknown
speaker
we
certainly
wouldn't
do
that
if
the
issue
were
involuntary
confinement.
unknown
speaker
somebody
says...
i
hope
not
too.
and
the
patient
brings
in
his
experts
who
says,
you
know,
he's
perfectly
able
to
function
outside
of
an
institution,
and
the
state's
experts
say,
no,
no,
no,
he
must
be
locked
up.
you
want
us
to
say,
well,
that's
the
state's
experts.
they
win.
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
we
have
to
worry
about
other
cases,
not
your
case.
unknown
speaker
this
isn't
even
a
class
action.
unknown
speaker
so,
the
question
is
a
very
pressing
one,
and
you
haven't
answered
it
yet.
unknown
speaker
but
what
we
don't
know
is,
mr.
gottesman...
is
how
many
other
people
the
experts
in
the...
in
the
institution
have...
justice
o'connor
just
made
the
point
it's
not
a
class
action.
we
have
two
individuals.
how
do
we
know
that
there
aren't
a
dozen
individuals
who
would
benefit
at
least
as
much--
unknown
speaker
--but
they
haven't
come
to
court?
what
you're
doing
is
saying
the
people
who
come
to
court
go
to
the
head
of
the
line.
unknown
speaker
what
if
you
get
into
a
situation,
mr.
gottesman,
where
you
have
what
you
call
the
professionals,
which
i
presume
means
m.d.'s
and
so
forth
in
the
hospital,
but
there's
a
hospital
administrator
who's
perhaps
a
political
appointee
and
he...
he
may
disagree
with
the
professionals
or
if
he
doesn't
like
what
the
professionals
are
doing,
maybe
he'll
hire
professionals
who
say
what
he
wants
them
to
say?
unknown
speaker
of
course
not,
but
he
would
hire,
as
the
chief
justice
suggests...
you
know,
as
sure
as
god
made
little
apples,
he
will
hire
professionals
who
agree
with
him,
people...
professionals
who
like
to
keep
everybody
in
institutions.
unknown
speaker
what
it
boils
down
to...
let's
assume...
i
mean,
just
i...
i
assume
there's
something
in
justice
scalia's
suggestion.
isn't
that
simply
a
problem
with
which
the
law
cannot
deal
beyond
this
point?
if
it
gets
in
front
of
a
judge,
a
judge
is
going
to
have
to
decide
which
professional
has
the
more
deserving
credibility.
there's
nothing
beyond
that
that
you
can
do
to...
to
respond
to...
to
that
problem
of
sort
of
stacking
the
deck,
is
there?
unknown
speaker
so,
your
answer
to
justice
breyer's
question
i
think
boils
down
to
this.
number
one,
what
is...
i
guess
in
terms
of
the
regulation,
what
is
appropriate
to
the
needs
is
number
one,
an...
an
issue
for
medical
and
mental
health
professionals.
unknown
speaker
number
two,
there
is
no
presumption
in
favor
of
release.
in
other
words,
one
does
not
go
into
court
as
a
plaintiff
with
the
benefit
of
a
presumption
that
one
ought
to
get
released
rather
than
not
released.
unknown
speaker
right,
but
that's
not
a...
i'm...
i'm
talking
about
a
presumption
apart
from
the
testimony
of
professionals.
unknown
speaker
and...
and
number
two,
the
burden...
number
three
i
guess,
the
burden
is
on
the
person
seeking
release--
unknown
speaker
--to
demonstrate
entitlement
to
release.
so,
that's
the
source
of...
of
what
i
think
you've
described
as
the
deference
to
the...
to
the
professionals
representing
the
institution.
unknown
speaker
are
those
the
three
components
basically?
unknown
speaker
well,
mr.
gottesman,
what
do
we
mean
by
the
most
integrated
setting?
unknown
speaker
well,
let
me
ask
you
this.
suppose
that
the
state
had
just
a
mental
institution
and
no
community
based
facilities,
but
the
plaintiff
comes
in
and
says,
look,
if
the
state
had
three
attendants
to
be
with
me
day
and
night
so
that
i
wouldn't
hurt
myself
or
anybody
else,
i
could
be
outside
this
institution
and
still
be
getting
care.
and
that
would
be
the
most
integrated
setting
under
your
definition.
must
the
state
do
that?
unknown
speaker
it
certainly
would...
would
be
the
most
integrated
setting,
though--
unknown
speaker
--under
your
definition
of
it.
unknown
speaker
isn't
there
also
a
limit
in
the
reg?
i
had
assumed...
maybe
i'm
wrong.
i
had
assumed
that
the
question
of
appropriateness
under
the
reg
would
take
into
consideration
cost.
unknown
speaker
suppose--
unknown
speaker
--suppose
the
state
said
we
have
500
spaces
in
the...
in
the
community
based
facility.
there
are
532
people
who
qualify.
what...
is
the
state
then
required
to
create
another
community
based
facility
to
take
care
of
the
32
who
don't
fit
into
the
space
available?
unknown
speaker
well,
they
can
help
it,
but
it
would
cost
money.
and
that...
see,
one
of
the
arguments
that
was
made,
you
can't
just
say
it's
cheaper
to
maintain
a
person
on
the
outside.
here's
this
huge
institution
and
it
costs
the
state
money.
the
state
is
going
to
lose
money
unless
it
can
get
everybody
out
of
the
institution.
unknown
speaker
do
they
have
an
opportunity
to
make
that
proof?
unknown
speaker
but,
as
i
understood,
georgia
to
take
the
position
that
what
was
sent
back
to
judge
shoob
was
a
much
less...
much
narrower
question
than
that.
unknown
speaker
but
in
any
case,
we
don't
have
any
question
before
us--
unknown
speaker
--about
how,
in
effects,
the
balance
should
be
struck
on...
on
what
is
reasonably...
what
is
reasonable
financially.
unknown
speaker
and
the...
the
only
question
we've
got,
i
guess,
is
whether
there
is
a...
kind
of
a...
just
a...
a
stone
wall
against
your
position
erected
by
a...
a
view
of
discrimination
that
says
that
as
long
as
you
treat
all
handicapped
persons,
regardless
of
the
handicapped...
their
handicap,
in
the
same
way,
as
a
matter
of
law,
there
can't
be
discrimination
under
the
statute.
that's
the
only
question
we've
got.
unknown
speaker
thank
you,
mr.
gottesman.
mr.
gornstein,
we'll
hear
from
you.
unknown
speaker
suppose
you
have
people
who
are
uncertain
on
that
point,
i
mean,
and
they
say,
it's
also
appropriate
at
the
hospital.
i'm
still
worried.
i
have
the
same
problem.
76,000
people
left.
many
of
those
76,000
need
the
institutionalized
care,
and
if
you
tell
me
it's
cheaper,
that's
part
of...
you
know,
it's
cheaper
to
put
them
out
in
a
halfway
house,
maybe
they'll
all
be
pushed
out
there.
that's
what
i'm
worried
about,
and
i
would
just
like
to
be
reassured
that
the
decision
that
we'll
make
in
this
case
will
be
balanced
and
not
somehow
get
it
wrong.
unknown
speaker
now,
what
do
you
do
when
people
disagree,
when
psychiatrists
are
not
certain
when,
as
here,
one
says
i
think
it's
appropriate
to
treat
her
in
the
facility,
not
outside?
unknown
speaker
mr.
gornstein,
can
i
ask,
what
administration...
what...
what
responsibilities
for
administering
this
act
does
the
attorney
general
have?
unknown
speaker
anything
else?
unknown
speaker
does
he
administer
the
act?
what
does
he--
unknown
speaker
--that...
that's
not
in
administration
of
the
act.
the
attorney
general
sues
in
criminal
law
as
well.
unknown
speaker
and
we
don't
give
him
deference
as
to
the
meaning
of
criminal
laws.
unknown
speaker
i'm
raising
the
question
of...
do
you
know
any
other
case
in
which
we
have
given
deference?
i
know
several
where
we
have
denied
deference
to
regulations
issued
by
an
agency
that
did
not
have
responsibility
for
administering
the
act.
do
you
know
of
any
where
we
have
given
deference?
unknown
speaker
suppose
congress
tells
the
attorney
general
to
issue
regulations
concerning
the
meaning
of
section
1983.
would
we
be
bound
by
his...
by
his
interpretation
of
it?
unknown
speaker
can
congress--
unknown
speaker
--you
see,
i
thought
chevron
deference
was...
came
about
because
when
congress
passes
a
statute
that
requires
administration
by
an
executive
agency,
the
executive
is
necessarily
the
first
person
to
take
a
cut
at
giving
meaning
to
it,
and
we
give
deference
to
that
person's
cut
because
it's
part
of
his
necessary
function.
but
you
have
here
a
statute
in
which
congress
simply
said,
we
don't
want
the
courts
to
interpret
this
legislation,
we
want
the
attorney
general
to,
and
gave...
gave
power
to
the
attorney
general
to
simply
make
rules,
not
because
he's
responsible
for
administering
the
act,
but
because
congress
just
likes
the
attorney
general's
view
of
the
statute
better
than
it
likes
ours.
i
don't
know
of
any
other
instance
where
we've
done
that.
unknown
speaker
right
and
what's
the
cite
for
bragdon?
unknown
speaker
well,
it's
pretty
scary
if
we
decided
that
way.
unknown
speaker
it
was
the
dentist
case.
unknown
speaker
tell
me...
tell
me
i
didn't
join
that
opinion.
it's
118--
unknown
speaker
--i
feel
much
better.
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
but
that...
that--
unknown
speaker
--well,
what
if
congress
delegated
to
the
criminal
division
the
authority
to
construe
criminal
statutes?
unknown
speaker
well,
but
no--
unknown
speaker
--a
statute
that
defines,
say,
the
dyer
act,
transportation
and
interstate
commerce.
justice
department,
you
construe
this.
you
know,
what
does
interstate
commerce
mean?
what's
an
automobile?
unknown
speaker
mr....
i
know
you're
anxious
to
do
something.
we
did
not
reach
the
chevron
point
in
deference...
chevron
deference
point
in
bragdon.
we
did
not
decide
that
you
were
entitled
to
the
chevron
deference.
we
say
you're
entitled
to
deference
because
it's
a
well
reasoned
view
of--
unknown
speaker
--much
like
many
sources.
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
at
that
time,
of
course,
courts
were
divided
on
the
meaning
of
those
regulations,
and
that
brings
us
back
to
how
do
we
interpret
those
regulations
of
the
ag.
and
it
certainly
wasn't
clear
at
the
time
that
the
regs
under
504
demanded
the
least
restrictive
care.
unknown
speaker
well,
the
regulation
doesn't
really
say
that,
does
it?
unknown
speaker
the
fundamental
change
business?
unknown
speaker
so,
is
it
your
position
that
if
the
state
had
no
community
based
facilities,
it
would
not
have
to
create
them,
although
many
people
would
be
better
served--
unknown
speaker
--how
about
release
under
the...
under
the
circumstances
that
one
on
one
care
with
round
the
clock
aides
would
be
less
restrictive?
unknown
speaker
well,
how
would
you
answer
the
question
if
the
state
hadn't
been
doing
that?
they
don't
have
one
on
one
care.
they
may
have
community
based
housing,
but
with
limited
staff
to
serve
a
number
of
residents.
unknown
speaker
is
this
statute
or
the
regulation?
unknown
speaker
the
honorable
court
is
now
adjourned
until
monday
next
at
ten
o'clock.
