this
case
concerns
title
ii
of
the
americans
with
disabilities
act
of
1990,
a
measure
i
will
abbreviate
as
the
ada.
title
ii
of
the
ada
prohibits
public
entities
from
discriminating
against
persons
with
disabilities
by
reason
of
their
disabilities.
our
task
is
to
deicide
what
that
anti-discrimination
provision
means.
to
ward
off
incorrect
description
i
know
first
that
the
case
as
it
comes
to
us
presents
no
constitutional
question.
the
law
we
are
to
apply
as
a
congressional
text
along
with
implementing
regulations
congress
instructed
the
attorney
general
to
issue.
two
of
the
attorney
general's
regulations
are
in
point.
the
first
called
the
"integration
regulations"
states
that
a
"public
entity"
shall
administer
services
and
programs
in
the
most
integrated
setting
appropriate
to
the
needs
of
qualified
individuals
with
disabilities.
the
second,
called
here
the
reasonable
modifications
regulation,
states
that
a
public
entity
shall
make
reasonable
modifications
to
avoid
discrimination
on
the
basis
of
disability,
but
need
not
make
changes
that
would
fundamentally
alter
the
nature
of
the
service
the
entity
provides.
the
question
we
confront
is
whether
title
ii's
discrimination
proscription
may
sometimes
require
a
state
to
place
persons
with
mental
disabilities
in
community
settings
rather
than
in
state
institutions.
our
answer
is
a
qualified
yes.
respondents
l.
c.
and
e.
w.
are
mentally
retarded
women,
ones
voluntarily
confined
for
treatment
in
a
psychiatric
unit
at
georgia
regional
hospital
in
atlanta.
l.
c.
filed
suit
against
various
state
officials
alleging
that
the
state
violated
title
ii
of
the
ada.
when
it
failed
to
place
her
in
a
community
based
treatment
program
after
her
treating
professionals
determined
that
such
placement
was
appropriate
for
her.
e.
w.
intervened
in
the
action
raising
an
identical
ada
claim.
the
district
court
ruled
in
favor
of
l.
c.
and
e.
w.
and
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
eleventh
circuit
affirmed
in
large
part.
the
appeals
court
read
the
ada
and
the
attorney
general's
regulations
to
call
for
treatment
of
persons
with
mental
disabilities
in
the
most
integrated
setting
appropriate
to
the
patient's
needs,
but
remanded
for
reassessment
of
the
state's
cost-based
defense.
we
affirm
the
court
of
appeals
judgment
in
substantial
part.
unjustified
institutionalization
of
persons
with
mental
disabilities
we
hold
qualified
as
discrimination
by
reason
of
a
disability
within
the
compass
of
the
ada's
title
ii.
in
findings
applicable
to
the
entire
ada
congress
explicitly
identified
segregation
of
persons
with
disabilities
as
a
form
of
discrimination.
unnecessary
segregation
of
persons
with
mental
disabilities
perpetuates
unwarranted
assumptions
that
such
persons
are
unfit
for
or
unworthy
of
participating
in
community
life.
if
unnecessary,
institutionalization
is
the
price
that
a
person
with
mental
disabilities
must
pay
to
receive
needed
medical
services,
then
that
person
is
forced
to
forego
the
pleasure
of
the
less
restrictive
living
that
person
could
enjoy
given
reasonable
accommodations.
persons
without
disabilities
on
the
other
hand
can
receive
needed
medical
services
without
similar
sacrifice.
the
court
of
appeals
returned
the
case
to
the
district
court
for
consideration
whether
the
additional
expenditure
necessary
to
provide
community
based
care
to
l.
c.
and
e.
w.
would
be
so
unreasonable
given
the
demands
of
the
state's
mental
health
budget
that
it
would
fundamentally
alter
the
services
the
state
provides.
we
hold
that
the
court
of
appeals
remand
instruction
was
unduly
restrictive.
to
maintain
a
range
of
facilities
for
the
treatment
of
persons
with
diverse
mental
disabilities
and
to
administer
those
services
with
an
even
hand,
the
state
must
have
more
leeway
than
the
courts
below
understood
the
fundamental
alteration
defense
to
allow.
the
district
court
should
not
confine
its
consideration
to
the
cost
of
providing
community
based
care
to
the
two
litigants
alone;
l.
c.
and
e.
w.
that
court
must
also
consider
in
view
of
the
resources
available
to
the
state.
the
range
of
services
the
state
provides
others
with
mental
disabilities,
and
the
state's
obligation
to
meet
out
those
services
equitably.
if
for
example,
the
state
were
to
demonstrate
that
it
had
a
comprehensive
effectively
working
plan
for
placing
qualified
persons
with
mental
disabilities
in
less
restrictive
settings,
and
the
waiting
list
that
moved
at
a
reasonable
pace
not
controlled
by
the
state's
endeavors
to
keep
its
institutions
fully
populated,
the
reasonable
modifications
requirement
would
be
met.
in
sum,
we
conclude
that
title
ii
of
the
ada
requires
states
to
provide
community
based
treatment
for
persons
with
mental
disabilities,
when
the
state's
treatment
professionals
have
determined
that
such
placement
is
appropriate,
when
the
affected
persons
do
not
oppose
such
treatment,
and
when
the
placement
can
be
reasonably
accommodated
taking
into
account
the
resources
available
to
the
state
and
the
needs
of
others
with
mental
disabilities.
our
opinion
emphasizes
that
nothing
in
the
ada
or
its
implementing
regulations
condones
the
termination
of
institutional
treatment
for
persons
unable
to
handle
or
benefit
from
community
based
care,
nor
is
there
any
federal
requirement
that
community
based
treatment
be
imposed
on
patients
who
do
not
desire
it.
