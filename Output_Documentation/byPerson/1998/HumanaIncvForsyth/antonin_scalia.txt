justice
antonin
scalia
some
insurance
commissioners
would
like
to
have
stronger
state
insurance
regulation
laws.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
well,
i'm...
you
know,
i'm
not
sure
you're
really
urging
a
different
test
from
the
test
that
your
opponents
argue,
the
way
you
describe
it.
you're
asserting
there's
a
conflict
between
the
federal
government's
providing
for
treble
damages
and
the
state's
desire
not
to
have
treble
damages.
i
mean,
does
it
make
sense
to
fight
this
on
the
battlefield
of
whether
we're
going
to
have
a
conflict
test
versus
a,
quote,
impairment
test?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
can't
comply
with
one
law
and
comply
with
the
other
at
the
same--
justice
antonin
scalia
--well--
justice
antonin
scalia
--you're
content
to
have
that
as
the
test,
whether
you
conflict
with
the
policy
of
the
state?
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
justice
antonin
scalia
are
there
other
more
general
nevada
laws
that
could
apply
to
insurance
fraud?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
is
that...
is
the
application
of
that
law
somehow
limited
by
the
special
provision
governing
insurers?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
understand
that,
but
whether
you're
contravening
some
policy
set
forth
in
the
state
insurance
law
in
particular
is
affected
by
whether
that
state
insurance
law
is
hermetically
sealed,
or
whether
in
fact
the
insurance
company
is
subject
to
a
lot
of
other
state
laws
anyway.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
about
violation
by
the
insurance
company
of
that...
the
common
law
fraud
provision?
justice
antonin
scalia
would
that
come
under
the
little
rico?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
didn't
get
that
last
point.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
punitive
damages
exception
for
driving
someone
into
insolvency
does
not
apply
to--
justice
antonin
scalia
--okay.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
his
point
would
be
you
would
need
a
bigger
insolvency
fund,
which
means
you
would
need
higher
premiums,
and
his
point
would
be
that
the
legislature
has
carefully
calculated
what
a
good
level
of
premiums
is,
and
it
doesn't
include
the
level
necessary
to
pump
up
the
insolvency
fund
enough
to
cover
treble
damages.
justice
antonin
scalia
through
settlement,
you
mean?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
have
treble
damages,
you
can
get
a
settlement
that
makes
you
whole?
justice
antonin
scalia
the
same
with
yours.
justice
antonin
scalia
before
you
go
on,
mr.
blakey,
i
wasn't
aware
that
conflict
preemption
in
the
federal
scheme...
you
know,
you
mentioned
the
three
types,
field,
and
so
forth.
i
wasn't
aware
that
conflict
preemption
was
limited
to
the
case
where
you're
put
under
conflicting
obligations.
i
would
think
that
a
state
statute
could
conflict
with
a
federal
statute
if
it
frustrated
the
purpose
of
a
federal
statute.
justice
antonin
scalia
let's
assume
you
had
a
prologue
to
the
statute
of
the
sort
that
was
hypothesized
this
morning,
where
the
state
legislature
says
very
clearly
we
don't
think
that
insurance
companies
should
be
exposed
to
treble
damages
because
we're
concerned
about
their
solvency
and
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah,
okay,
and
then
it
proceeds
to
enact
this
thing.
would
you
say
that
even
in
that
stark
situation
this
rico
treble
damage
proceeding
would
not
impair
the
state
law?
justice
antonin
scalia
how
is
that
different
from
supersede?
wouldn't
that
be--
justice
antonin
scalia
--all
right.
try
invalidate.
justice
antonin
scalia
if
you
invalidated
it
only
in
part
it
wouldn't
be
an
invalidation?
i
would
think
it
was
an
invalidation.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
didn't
they
say,
invalidates
or
supersede
in
whole
or
in
part?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
that's
only--
