justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
your
argument,
it
seems
to
me,
on
impair
talks
about
impairing
the
business
of
the
insurance
companies,
not
impairing
any
law.
mccarran
ferguson
says
no
act
of
congress
shall
be
construed
to
invalidate,
impair
or
supersede
any
law
enacted
by
the
state.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
what
law
enacted
by
nevada
was
impaired
by
this?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
are
those
laws
still
rendered
unlawful
notwithstanding
the
application
of
rico?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well
then,
how
are
they
impaired?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
but
the
remedies
provided
in
those
provisions
may
be
enforced
to
the
letter
as
far
as
the
nevada
legislature
is
authorized.
justice
john
paul
stevens
the...
in
other
words,
the
nevada
laws
can
be
fully
enforced,
notwithstanding
the
enforcement
of
rico,
and
that's...
for
that
reason
it's
hard
for
me
to
see
how
those
laws
have
been
impaired.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
but
even
if
it
did,
and
they'd
say
for
that
reason
we've
decided
there's
going
to
be
a
cap
on
all
state
law
causes
of
action,
you
may
still
enforce
the
state
law
cause
of
action
100
percent,
and
therefore,
how
is
it
impaired?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
it's
not
an
idle
act.
if
you
sue
in
the
nevada
courts
you
can
only
get
those
damages.
it
still...
it
defines
the
scope
of
the
nevada
remedy,
and
the
nevada
remedy
is
precisely
the
same,
whether
or
not
rico
is
on
the
books.
justice
john
paul
stevens
oh,
i'm
not
sure
that's
right.
i
think
they
also
have
an
interest
in
protecting
policyholders
and
the
general
public.
it's
not
just
to
protect
the
industry.
justice
john
paul
stevens
let
me
give
you
another--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--supposing
your
federal
statute
authorizes
a
remedy
for
a
rico
fraud
that
you
can
seize
the
assets
of
the
company
that
have
been
used
to
perpetrate
the
fraud,
but
the
nevada
statute
does
not
have
that
remedy
in
it.
could
you
enforce
the
federal
remedy
or
not?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
could
not.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
you're
explaining
his
view,
and
i
think
the
chief
justice
asked
you
what
is
your
view.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i'm
still
a
little
puzzled,
because
is
it...
are
you
suggesting
that
a
law
could
invalidate
a
state
law
without
impairing
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
still
seems
to
me
under
your
reading
it
is,
too.
justice
john
paul
stevens
can
you
give
me
an
example,
under
your
reading,
of
a
law
that
would
impair
the
state
law
without
invalidating
or
superseding
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
--may
i
suggest,
mr.
wallace,
that
the
statute
can
be
read
to
impair
a
state
insurance
policy
that
favors
collective
rate
making
without
affirmatively
commanding
it,
because
clearly
most
insurance...
and
that
that's
exactly
what
they...
well,
the
congress
wanted
to
preserve,
even
though
it
didn't
invalidate
any
specific
law
in
itself,
but
just
conflicted
with
the
policy.
do
you
understand
what...
my
question's
a
little
garbled,
but--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--but
they
did
not
want
the
sherman
act
to
be
construed
to
ban
collective
rate
making
by
states
where
there
was--
