mr.
james
w.
colbert,
iii
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
issue
presented
before
the
court
here
reduces
itself
down
to
two
questions.
the
first
and
the
most
fundamental
question
is
the
meaning
that
congress
intended
to
the
phrase
invalidate,
impair,
or
supersede
as
used
in
the
mccarran
ferguson
act.
did
congress
intend
to
afford
to
those
words,
and
particularly
to
the
word
impair,
its
common
parlance
plain
meaning,
or
did
congress
intend
a
special,
restricted
meaning,
as
respondents
and
the
government
have
argued
and
as
the
court
below
has
found?
i
suggest
to
the
court
that
that
critical
question
makes
the
second
question
easy.
the
second
question
is,
under
a
proper
reading
of
the
word
impair,
and
i
focus
on
that
because
i
think
it
is
the
critical
word,
under
a
proper
reading
of
the
word
impair,
as
intended
by
congress,
is
a
state
regulatory
scheme
impaired
by
an
alternative
federal
remedy
that
renders
academic
the
state
legislature's
decision
as
to
the
appropriate
remedy
to
be
afforded
for
the
violation
of
some
standard?
those
are
the
two
questions
that
i
believe
are
dispositive
of
the
matter
before
the
court.
with
respect
to
the
first
question,
the
court
below
did
not
attempt
a
parsing
of
the
language.
we
do
not
see
anything
in
the
decision
of
the
ninth
circuit
or
of
the
other
circuits
that
adopt
the
same
view
as
the
ninth
circuit,
no
attempt
to
go
to
the
words
of
the
statute
and
ask,
what
does
the
word
impair
mean?
what
did
it
mean
to
the
79th
congress
when
the
mccarran
ferguson
act
was
adopted?
in
the
courts
of
appeal,
what
we
had
is
an
interpretation
by
analogy.
the
mccarran
ferguson
act
has
about
it
an
aspect
of
preemption
in
that
it
has
an
analogous
effect
and
therefore
the
ninth
circuit
and
the
other
circuits
that
go
along
with
the
ninth
circuit
have
reasoned,
we
believe
incorrectly
for
the
reasons
set
forth
in
our
briefs,
that
preemption
and
the
special
rules
of
preemption
apply.
mr.
james
w.
colbert,
iii
whether
a
remedy
is
supplemental
of
a
state
scheme
or
impairment
of
a
state
scheme
depends
upon
the
answer
to
the
question
of
whether
we
take
seriously
the
decision
of
the
state
legislature
to
limit
remedies.
if
nevada
in
this
instance,
when
it
had
adopted
the
private
cause
of
action
under
its
state
insurance
law,
had
said,
we...
had
put
a
preamble
in
that
said,
the
legislature
has
considered
and
rejected
enhanced
damages
because
of
a
concern
for
impeding
the
solvencies
of
insurers
for
the
purpose
of
giving
windfalls
to
the
first
person
to
get
into
the
courthouse
door,
if
we
had
such
a
preamble,
there
could
be
no
question--
mr.
james
w.
colbert,
iii
--but
the
limit
on
punitive
damages,
which
is
critical
to
this
issue,
is
that
punitive
damages,
are
not
allowed
where
they
impair
the
solvency
of
the
defendant.
you
may
punish,
but
you
may
not
destroy,
and
the
first
goal
of
the
insurance
laws
of
the
state
of
nevada
and
every
other
state
in
the
union
is
to
protect
the
solvency
of
the
insurers.
rico
gives
no
discretion
to
the
court.
treble
damages
are
mandatory,
and
if
that
impairs
the
solvency
of
the
insurer,
so
be
it.
the
same
is
not
true
of
punitive
damages.
mr.
james
w.
colbert,
iii
but
why
do
we
put
the
burden
on
the
state
of
nevada
to
adopt
the
hypothetical
preamble
i
came
up
with
a
moment
before?
why
is
it
nevada's
burden
to
justify
its
legislative
decision?
the
structure
of
the
mccarran
ferguson--
mr.
james
w.
colbert,
iii
--well,
what
are
we
to
have
the
district
courts
do
in
applying
federal
law
in
this
instance?
are
we
to
now
ask
the
federal
district
courts
to
examine
the
legislative
history
of
every
portion
of
the
insurance
law
in
nevada
or
the
several
states,
and
ask
the
question,
did
the
nevada
state
legislature
mean
it
when
it
adopted--
mr.
james
w.
colbert,
iii
--absolutely.
mr.
james
w.
colbert,
iii
well,
it
is
perfectly
plain
from
the
debates
and
the
enactment
of
the
mccarran
ferguson
act
that
congress
was,
as
you've
just
suggested,
justice
breyer,
extremely
concerned
about
inadvertent
interference
with
the
state
regulation
of
the
business
of
insurance,
and
it's
for
that
reason
that
congress
placed
upon
itself
the
burden
of
saying
when
congressional
legislation
would
apply,
the
reference
in
the
mccarran
ferguson
act
to
no
act
of
congress
except
that
specifically
related
to
the
business
of
insurance.
and
it
is
perfectly
plain
that
congress
intended
more
than
just
antipreemption,
but
remember--
mr.
james
w.
colbert,
iii
--when...
federal
law
applies
where
the
federal
rule
of
decision
results
in
a
different
answer
from
the
state
rule
of
decision
with
respect
to
the
business
of
insurance,
the
relationship
between
an
insurance
company
and
its
insureds.
and
the
notion
that
it
is
somehow
the
burden
of
the
state
of
nevada
to
say,
when
we
adopted
a
private
remedy
that
allows
only
compensatory
damages,
we
thought
about
that,
we
thought
about
whether
compensatory
damages
would
be
sufficient,
or
whether
we
should
have
enhanced
damages,
the
notion
that
mccarran
ferguson
places
on
the
states
the
obligation
to
put
such
preambles
in
the
law
is
inconsistent
with
the
observation
you
just
made,
justice
breyer,
which
was
congress
didn't
want
congress
to
interfere
by
accident
with
the
regulation
of
the
states.
congress
could
have
provided
that
rico
applies
to
the
business
of
insurance.
it
can
do
so
tomorrow,
but
it
is
not
nevada's
burden
under
the
act
to
anticipate
that
congress
will
adopt
a
statute
and
then
have
an
ambiguity
down
the
road
as
to
whether
or
not
the
nevada
decision
with
respect
to
remedies
will
or
will
not
be
respected
by
the
federal
courts.
mr.
james
w.
colbert,
iii
the
nevada
law,
your
honor,
i
believe
is
referenced
in
one
of
the
amicus
briefs,
and
i'm
sorry
i
don't
have
the
citation
at
my
finger
tips.
mr.
james
w.
colbert,
iii
it
is
a
case
i
believe
from
the...
i
believe
it
is
from
the
nevada
supreme
court.
i'm
embarrassed
that
i
cannot
give
the
court
the
cite.
the
principle--
mr.
james
w.
colbert,
iii
--it
is
not
in
our
brief,
your
honor.
it
was
not...
it
is
i
believe
a
generally
accepted
principle,
not
simply
in
nevada
but
generally
among
the
states.
it
may...
i
appreciate
that
this
court
has
struggled
many
times
with
punitive
damages.
i
would
suggest
that
it
is
probably
a
constitutionally
driven
principle,
but
of
course--
mr.
james
w.
colbert,
iii
--that's
not
before
the
court.
mr.
james
w.
colbert,
iii
that
is
correct.
it
is
an
issue
created
by
judicial
interpretation.
mr.
james
w.
colbert,
iii
well,
it
does
not
surprise
me
that
the
executive
branch
of
the
state
wishes
to
have
available
to
it
all
of
the
possible
remedies
and
weapons
that
it
can
use
to
carry
out
the
executive
policy.
the
mccarran
ferguson
act--
mr.
james
w.
colbert,
iii
--that's
correct,
justice
scalia,
and
they
haven't
been
able
to
get
them.
that's
why
they
are
supportive
of
the
application
of
rico,
because
they've
been
unable
to
persuade
the
state
legislatures
to
give
them
comparable
remedies,
comparable
weapons.
it
is
the
state
legislatures
that
are
the
beneficiaries
of
the
mccarran
ferguson
act.
it
is
to
the
state
legislative
decision
that
congress
deferred,
not--
mr.
james
w.
colbert,
iii
--that
is
correct.
mr.
james
w.
colbert,
iii
it's
nevada
code
section
686a,
chapter
686a
of
the
nevada
revised
statutes,
most
specifically
sections.310
of
that
particular
chapter,
which
enumerates
various
acts
which
are
rendered
unlawful
under
nevada
insurance
law
and
provides
a--
mr.
james
w.
colbert,
iii
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
james
w.
colbert,
iii
because
nevada
elected
not
to
provide
an
enhanced
damage
remedy
for
violation
of
those
provisions,
whereas
the
parallel
substantive--
mr.
james
w.
colbert,
iii
--yes.
mr.
james
w.
colbert,
iii
well,
i
return
to
the
question,
suppose
the
preamble
to
the
private
remedy
contained
in
that
same
statute
expressly
recognized
the
possibility
of
enhanced
damage
and
stated
the
decision
of
the
nevada
legislature
to
provide
only
compensatory
damages,
not
enhanced
damages.
that
preamble
does
not
exist,
don't
get
me
wrong.
mr.
james
w.
colbert,
iii
because
you
have
made
the
decision
of
the
nevada
legislature
to
limit
damages
in
that
fashion
an
idle
act.
you
have...
you
have
as
much
impaired
their--
mr.
james
w.
colbert,
iii
--but
keep
in
mind,
justice
stevens,
that
the
principal
goal
of
insurance
regulation
in
this
state
and
every
other
state
is
the
protection
of
the
solvency
of
the
carrier.
mr.
james
w.
colbert,
iii
oh,
no,
i
don't
mean
to
overstate
it,
but
it
clearly
is
the
principal
aim
of
all
state
insurance
legislation,
because
that
is
how
you
protect
policyholders.
the
policyholders
of
an
insurance
company
are
most
protected
if
the
company
is
still
in
existence
to
pay
the
claim.
if
the
ability
of
a
company
to
pay
the
claims
of
policyholders
next
year
is
impaired
because
a
policyholder
this
year
recovered
treble
damages,
you
have
clearly
impaired
the
principal
goal
of
the
state
regulation.
you
cannot
brush
aside
the
decision
of
a
state
legislature
to
award
only
compensatory
damages
to
a
policyholder.
that
is,
the
policyholder
will
now
get
that
which
the
policyholder
is
entitled
to
receive
under
the
policy.
giving
a
mandatory
trebling
of
that
amount
with
no
discretion
in
the
trial
court
to
reduce
it
is
not
consistent
with
the
notion
that
what
you
want
to
do
is
have
the
insurance
company
here
tomorrow
to
pay
tomorrow's
claims.
now,
again,
i
cannot
point
the
court
to
a
preamble
in
the
nevada
law
that
says,
we,
the
legislature,
gave
this
thought
when
we
were
adopting
the
private
right
of
action
that
exists
in
nevada
law.
mr.
james
w.
colbert,
iii
yes.
mr.
james
w.
colbert,
iii
well,
the
traditional
analysis,
your
honor,
is
to
examine
the
amount
of
the
jury's
award,
or
i
suppose
if
you
get
a
bench
trial
award
as
well,
and
to
compare
that
with
the
net
worth
of
the
company
to
ascertain
whether
payment
of
those
sums
would
significantly
impair
the
net
worth
of
the
company.
it's
a...
it
is
the
kind
of
analysis
that's
done
all
the
time.
mr.
james
w.
colbert,
iii
i
don't
believe,
justice
breyer,
that
i
have
argued,
nor
can
you
read
the
mccarran
ferguson
act
to
go
so
far
as
to
say
it
was
an
intention
by
congress
to
yield
the
federal
taxing--
mr.
james
w.
colbert,
iii
--because
the
imposition
of
the
federal
tax
has
no
effect
upon
the
collection
of
the
state
tax.
mr.
james
w.
colbert,
iii
but
i
see
a
distinction,
if
i
may,
between
the
state
indicating
it
wishes
to
collect
its
tax
and
a
state
making
a
decision
that
the
remedy
that
will
be
afforded
to
a
private
litigant
will
be
limited
to
that
which
makes
the
litigant
whole
and
provides
no
more
for
the
litigant,
no
enhanced
damages,
out
of
the
view
that
after
all,
all
of
these
litigants...
at
least
all
the
ones
we're
talking
about
here...
are
policyholders.
they're
all
claiming
the
same
pool
of
funds,
the
ultimate
availability
of
which
is
dependent
upon
the
continued
solvency
of
the
insurance
carrier
who's
going
to
pay
all
these
claims,
and
to
make
a
decision
at
the
state
court
level
that
as
between
different
private
litigants,
different
policyholders,
we
are
not
going
to
permit
windfalls.
we're
only
going
to
permit
recovery.
i
see
a
difference
between
that
and
the
decision
on
the
part
of
the
state
that
we're
going
to
collect
a
tax,
and
because
we
want
to
collect
a
tax,
we're
going
to
urge
that
we
have
the
ability
under
the
mccarran
ferguson
act
to
restrict
congress'
ability
to
tax
the
same
entity.
you're
not
directing
yourself
at
the
same
issue.
in
the
instance
in
which
you
have
single
damages
as
opposed
to
enhanced
damages,
you
really
are
asking
yourself
the
question,
should
i
be
taking
money
out
of
the
pocket,
or
potentially
taking
money
out
of
the
pockets
of
policyholders
next
year
in
order
to
provide
excess
compensation
to
policyholders
this
year.
it's
the
same
body
of
people
that
the
state
is...
the
state
legislation's
intended
to
protect,
and
i
don't
see
the
analogy
between
that
and--
mr.
james
w.
colbert,
iii
--not
as
you
have
used
the
word
conflict,
justice
scalia,
but
i'm
afraid
that
we
can
get
ourselves
lost
in
semantics.
the
test
that
is
being
urged
by
the
respondents
and
the
government
is
what
they
call
the
direct
conflict
test,
and
by
that
they--
mr.
james
w.
colbert,
iii
--exactly.
mr.
james
w.
colbert,
iii
and
if
we
use
conflict
itself
in
the
more
common
parlance
mat
that
we
use...
that
i've
just
used
since
i've
been
speaking
with
justice
breyer,
then
conflict
is
a
perfectly
good
word.
i'm
quite
content--
mr.
james
w.
colbert,
iii
--that
is
correct.
mr.
james
w.
colbert,
iii
and
i
suggest
that
you
find
the
policy
of
the
state
only
by
looking,
as
the
mccarran
ferguson
act
directs
us
to,
look
at
the
laws
of
the
state
enacted
for
the
purpose
of
regulating
insurance,
and
ask
yourself
if
the
laws
of
the
state
are
materially
different
than
the
otherwise
parallel
federal
law,
because--
mr.
james
w.
colbert,
iii
--it
doesn't--
mr.
james
w.
colbert,
iii
--that
is
correct,
justice
ginsburg.
mr.
james
w.
colbert,
iii
there
is,
and
the
reason
is
that
in
punitive
damage
instance
the
trial
judge
always
has
the
discretion
to
reduce
the
punitive
damage
award.
it's
never
mandatory.
for
rico,
it
is
mandatory.
it
does
not
matter
what
the
consequence
may
be
to
the
insurance
company.
you
could
have
a
situation
in
which,
as
a
result
of
mandatory
treble
damages,
the
insurance
company
defendant
goes
straight
into
liquidation.
it
is
insolvent.
you
could
have
the
same
award
come
out
of
a
jury
and
the
trial
judge
doesn't
have
to
let
that
happen,
and
i
suggest
it
would
be
an
abuse
of
discretion
to
allow
that
to
happen,
and
that
is
a
very
real
difference.
now,
i'm
not
pretending
in
this
case
that
the
award
below
is
going
to
put
this
petitioner
into
liquidation,
but
if
you're...
but
if
you
want
to
ask
yourself
the
question
of
whether
we
have
an
important
policy
issue
at
the
state
court
level,
i
think
it's
fairly
clear
that
we
do.
mr.
james
w.
colbert,
iii
any
state
insurance
law
that
didn't
provide
for
treble
damages,
that
is
correct,
and
i
said
the
treble
damage
provision
in
this
case...
because
that's
what
we
have.
we
have...
nevada
does
have
a
private
cause
of
action,
allows
compensatory
damages,
whereas
rico
has
treble
damages.
obviously
in
other
states
the
points
of
distinction
might
be
broader
than
we
have
in
this
particular
case,
but
in
this
case
that
is
the
point
of
distinction.
mr.
james
w.
colbert,
iii
nevada
recognizes
a
common
law
cause
of
action
for
bad
faith
failure
to
provide
benefit.
mr.
james
w.
colbert,
iii
no,
because
the
nevada...
nevada
insurance
legislation
does
not
purport
to
supplant
other
nevada
state
law.
it
has
a
preamble
in
which
it
indicates
that
it
is
intended
to
comply
with
the
requirements
of
mccarran
ferguson
that
there
be
state
regulation,
but
there
is
no
indication,
and
i
believe
the
contrary
is
indicated,
that
nevada
intended
by
the
adoption
of
its
insurance
law
to
oust
other
nevada
state
law.
that
is
not...
that's
not
the
issue
that
mccarran
ferguson
raises.
mccarran
ferguson
directs
the
court
to
compare
the
federal
laws
of
general
applicability
with
the
state
laws
enacted
for
the
purpose
of
regulating
the
business
of
insurance,
and
that's
the
focus
that--
mr.
james
w.
colbert,
iii
--well,
in
this
instance,
although
i
do
not
believe
that
it
is
dispositive
of
the
question,
in
this
instance,
as
the
district
court
noted
below,
nevada
does
have
a
little
rico,
and
the
predicate
acts
listed
in
nevada's
little
rico
do
not
include
violation
of
the
provisions
of
the
nevada
insurance
law
that
are
implicated
by
the
conduct
alleged.
if
we're
going
to
look
to
what
the
nevada
legislature
did,
we
do
have
some
indication
that
the
nevada
legislature
did
not
elect
to
provide
treble
damages,
as
their
little
rico
provides,
for
this
kind
of
conduct,
but
i
don't
think
claimants
responsible--
mr.
james
w.
colbert,
iii
--of
the--
mr.
james
w.
colbert,
iii
--no,
justice
scalia.
the
little
rico
statute
in
nevada
is
quite
explicit
with
respect
to
what
it
lists.
the
district
court
went
through
it.
we've
discussed
it
in
our
brief.
there
isn't...
the
provisions--
mr.
james
w.
colbert,
iii
--of
the
insurance
law
that
are
implicated--
mr.
james
w.
colbert,
iii
--no.
mr.
james
w.
colbert,
iii
i
think
that
would
be
a
more
extreme
example.
mr.
james
w.
colbert,
iii
mr.
chief
justice,
may
i
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time?
mr.
james
w.
colbert,
iii
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
let
me
begin
by
thanking
my
opposing
counsel
from
respondents
for
answering
the
question
i
was
unable
to
answer
from
justice
ginsburg
before
with
respect
to
the
citation.
that
is
the
case
that
i
had
in
mind
as
the
leading
authority
in
nevada
on
the
limitations
on
the
award
of
punitive
damages.
let
me
move
on
to
the
areas
where
i'm
not
so
grateful
for
his
argument.
let
me
begin
first
with
the
standing
question.
we
heard
a
lot
about
standing
this
morning
in
the
prior
issue.
surely
there
is
no
question
before
this
court
that
humana
has
standing
to
contest
the
applicability
of
rico
to
it,
and
surely
there
is
no
question
that
this
court
will
not
be
announcing
a
rule
of
law
that
determines
whether
a
federal
statute
applies
or
not
by
looking
at
the
financial
condition
of
the
defendant
against
whom
the
federal
law
is
urged.
we
have
conceded
that
insolvency
is
not
an
issue
in
this
case,
but
that
is
not
an
answer
to
the
jurisprudential
problem
of
whether
the
states
are
entitled
to
have
federal
deference
under
the
mccarran
ferguson
act
to
decisions
which
are
related
to
that
consideration
in
the
general
context.
and
let
me
move,
then,
to
the
question
of
impair,
and
whether
a
state
statute
that
does
not
contemplate
multiple
damages,
as
the
nevada
statute
does
not,
is
in
fact
impaired.
several
justices
put
to
the
government
and
to
the
respondents
a
hypothetical
circumstance
that
i
posed
this
morning.
suppose
the
preamble
of
the
statute
specifically
recognized
the
state
interest
in
preserving
the
solvency
of
the
insurance
company
and
the
potential
impediment
to
that
state
purpose,
that
treble
damages,
mandatory
treble
damages
provide.
the
respondents
conceded
that
if
that
preamble
existed,
rico
would
impair
nevada
law.
the
government
did
not
make
such
a
concession,
but
i
suggest
that
the
government's
response
was
not
entirely
satisfactory.
the
issue
before
this
court
i
believe
boils
down
to
the
question
of
whether,
under
mccarran
ferguson,
the
states
must
adopt
such
preambles.
is...
are
the
federal
courts
to
look
beyond
what
the
state
statute
says
and
second
guess
the
policymaking
decision
of
the
state
legislature
to
say
that
the
state
legislature
didn't
really
mean
it
when
it
only
allowed
for
compensatory
damages
under
the
state
insurance
law?
the
counsel
for
respondents
concluded
his
argument
with
a
reference
to
judge
learned
hand.
let
me
conclude
mine
with
a
reference
to
judge
magruder
of
the
first
circuit
in
one
of
the
follow
up
cases
to
erie.
and
i
am
going
to
do
this
by
memory,
so
i
may
not
get
it
entirely
correct,
but
if
the
federal
courts
can
sit
in
judgment
of
the
state
legislatures
and
decide
whether
particular
legislative
enactments
are
or
are
not
important,
then
the
ghost
of
swift
v.
tison
still
walks
the
land,
greatly
reduced
in
size
but
still
capable
of
much
mischief.
thank
you.
