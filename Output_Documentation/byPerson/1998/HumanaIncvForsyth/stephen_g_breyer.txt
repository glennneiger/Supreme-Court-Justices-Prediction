justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
the
obvious
thing
would
be
much
simpler.
i
mean,
the
obvious
thing
if
you
didn't
know
anything
about
it,
you'd
say,
well,
this
court
held
that
insurance
was
interstate
commerce.
surprise,
surprise.
and
at
that
point
congress
is
worried
that
it
might
have
a
whole
lot
of
laws
out
there
that
affect
interstate
commerce,
and
it
doesn't
want
those
laws
to
affect
insurance.
it
doesn't
want,
in
other
words,
to
be
taken
by
surprise.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
congress
simply
says,
look
all
these
laws
out
there
that
we've
passed,
general
laws
affecting
interstate
commerce,
all
right,
they
don't
preempt
state
insurance
laws
unless
we
specifically
said
so
by
directing
limited
insurance,
end
of
the
matter,
period,
and
the
only
purpose
that
the
word
impair
is
doing
there
is
that
sometimes
you
could
in
effect
impair...
sorry.
you
could
in
effect
preempt
the
state
law
by
so
wrecking
it
through
your
preemptive
interpretation
that
although
it's
still
on
the
books
it's
severely
impaired.
in
other
words,
impair
does
almost
nothing,
not
completely
nothing
but
almost
nothing,
and
now,
if
that
is
so,
you
have
the
purpose
achieved
of
what
you
think
was
ordinary.
what's
the
evidence
that
what
i
just
said
is
not
the
case?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it
couldn't
have
said
when
it
would
apply.
i
don't
mean
to
cut
you
off,
but
obviously
the
tax
laws,
for
example,
don't
specifically
mention
insurance,
but
they
apply.
i
mean,
thousands
of
federal
laws
apply
to
insurance,
like
everything
else,
so
congress
couldn't
have
meant
just,
we
have
to
say
specifically
when
federal
law
applies.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
if
that's
so,
that's
what...
the
kind
of
thing
that
convinces
me
that
impair
can't
mean
impair,
or
it
must
mean
something
quite
weak.
on
your
theory,
suppose
nevada
passes
the
following
law:
on
good
legal
advice
we've
learned
that
the
federal
government
law
can't
impair
ours,
and
on
that
assumption
we
pass
a
law
that
all
insurance
companies
will
pay
a
5
percent
corporate
tax,
and
we
pick
this
number
5
because
we
know
they
won't
have
to
pay
any
more
federal
tax
once
we
pass
this
law,
because
we
think
for
them
to
pay
the
federal
business
tax,
you
know,
under
ordinary
corporate
tax
law,
we'll
really
impair
what
we're
trying
to
do
here,
which
is
to
raise
5
percent.
and
they
write
it
out
as
much
as
you
want,
and
every
federal
trial
judge
in
nevada
says,
that's
their
purpose
all
right.
this
whole
law
of
theirs
is
wrecked,
impaired,
if
they
have
to
pay
under
the
general
federal
law
the
ordinary
corporate
tax.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
why
not?
it's
a
general
law.
why
federal
tax
law
one
wit
more
or
less
than
federal
rico
law?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
oh,
yes,
they
find
it
does.
they
say,
as
you've
just
said,
we
don't
want
to
hurt
the
company's
position
and
how
much
money
it
has,
and
they
don't
have
enough
money
for
both,
and
we've
picked
a
rate
here
that
just
works
perfectly
and,
boy,
the
company
will
be
down
the
drain
if
they
have
to
pay
not
only
our
rate,
but
also
the
federal
rate.
i
can
draw
it
out
as
much
as
you
want.
we
both
could.
but
that's...
once
you
see
that,
it
seems
to
me
impossible
to
say
that
they
really
meant
that
word
impair
literally
the
way
you're
taking
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--what...
i'm
having
trouble
what
it
does
mean.
i
mean,
the
normal
thing,
if
you're
just
looking
to
preemption
analysis,
you
don't
really...
you
normally
don't
look
to
what
the
state
law's
about
except
in
a
limited
extent.
you
look
to
what
the
federal
law
is
about,
and
you
ask
yourself
whether
or
not
this
state
law...
state
law
prevents...
state
law
creates
a
direct
conflict
or
whether
or
not
this
federal
law
has
a
purpose
that
the
state
law
significantly
interferes
with
achieving.
now,
is
that
all
we're
supposed
to
do
here?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
if
the
answer
to
that's
yes,
then
all
it
says
is,
if
the
federal
law
would
preempt
a
state
law,
it
doesn't.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
oh,
but
that's
exactly
now
the
point,
because
conflict
can
take
place
in
one
of
two
ways.
you
put
people
under
conflicting
obligations,
in
which
case
it's
easy.
but
the
harder
case
is
typically
where
the
federal
law
is
trying
to
achieve
a
purpose,
which
purpose
the
state
law
interferes
with
achieving.
now,
if
we're
just
going...
is
it
your
view
that
the
word
impair
applies
only
in
that
case,
or
is
there
something
else,
like
you
look
to
the
state
purpose
and
see
if
the
federal
law
interferes
with
achieving
that
purpose?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
your
answer
is
the
first,
not
the
second.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
we
have
to...
that
is
exactly
the
question.
i
mean,
it
could
come
up
in
writing
the
opinion.
i
mean,
what
you
say
in
your
brief
is,
you
think
that
impair
a
law,
that
phrase
connotes
partial
preemption,
the
displacement
of
some
portion
of
a
statute
or
its
preclusion
in
certain
contexts.
so
then
isn't
your
answer,
and
explain
if
it
isn't,
to
justice
scalia's
question,
write
anything
in
that
preamble
you
want,
including
the
very
words
that
justice
scalia
suggested,
and
your
answer
would
be
no,
rico
does
not
impair
that
statute,
because
the
operate
words
of
that
statute
are
the
same
which
are
at
present
before
us.
is
that
your
answer?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
rico
would
apply.
rico
would
apply
in
justice
kennedy's
example,
rico
would
apply
in
justice
scalia's
example,
in
your
opinion.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right,
then,
and
if
you
don't
have
to
go
that
far
in
this
case--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--if
i
were
writing
the
opinion
and
got
to
the
phrase,
the
word
impair
means,
and
then
there's
a
blank,
how
would
you
fill
it
in?
