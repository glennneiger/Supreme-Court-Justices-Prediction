justice

bader

but
i
thought
the
law
didn't
commute
punitive
damages
which
have
no
lid
and
could
be
higher
than
treble
damages.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
as
far
as
your
brief
presentation
is
concerned,
the
nevada
punitive
damage
provision
has
no
cap
and
that's
it.
that's
all
you
put
before
us.
i
mean,
that's
all
that
you...
that
is
before
us
on
the
parties'
presentation.
never
mind
the
friends,
but
the
parties
have
one
treble
damages,
one
punitive
damages
with
no
cap,
no
cap
in
the
statute,
right?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
your
position
about
the...
you
keep
saying
nevada
doesn't
have
to
prove
this
or
that.
it's
slightly
uncomfortable
for
you
to
be
such
a
stalwart
champion
of
the
state
when
we
have
the
national
association
of
insurance
commissioners,
which
includes
nevada's
commissioner,
saying,
this
is
a
harmonious
provision.
this
rico
harmonizes
with
our
statute.
it
doesn't
impair
it.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you're
not
saying
there's
any
difference
in
substance,
so
does
your
whole
case...
do
i
understand
correctly
that
your
whole
case
turns
on
the
treble
damage
feature
of
the
federal
law,
which
you
say
is
absent
on
the
state
side?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
no
difference
in
substantive
provisions?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
then
if
you're
not
right
about
the
punitive
damages...
suppose
we
don't
have
this
case
that
says
we
won't
make
the
company
insolvent.
suppose
there's
no
lid
on
punitive
damages.
first,
there's
treble
damages
on
the
federal
side.
then
is
there
an
impairment?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
that
rico
would
be
incompatible
with
any
state
law
that
didn't
provide
for
treble
damages.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--mr.
wallace,
if
i
were
to
ask
you...
we
took
this
case
because
it's
a
purported
circuit
split,
and
we
have
the
ninth
circuit
direct
conflict.
as
far
as
i
understand
this
case
and
your
position
is,
you
don't
have...
that's
really
academic
in
this
case
because
these...
this
federal
law
is
in
total
harmony
with
the
state
law
and
so
you
don't
have
to
decide
in
this
case
other
cases
that
might
present
the
more
extreme
example,
or
are
you
saying,
yeah,
pick
one
of
these
tests?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
in
every
state's
law,
or
are
we
to
look
at
this
state's
law
and
say,
as
far
as
what
this...
it
doesn't
provide
just
an
administrative
remedy.
it
provides
for
going
to
court,
it
provides
for
punitive
damages,
as
far
as
nevada
is
concerned?
