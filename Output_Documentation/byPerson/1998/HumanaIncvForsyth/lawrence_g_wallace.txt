mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
full
text
of
the
mccarran
ferguson
act
is
set
out
in
the
appendix
to
the
blue
brief,
the
petitioner's
brief,
and
textual
analysis,
particularly
in
its
historical
context,
takes
us
a
long
way
in
this
case.
the
special
rule
of
statutory
construction
in
section
2(b)
or
1012(b)
does
not
say
that
no
act
of
congress
shall
be
construed
to
affect
the
insurance
business.
it's
quite
specific
in
saying
that
no
act
shall
be
construed
to
invalidate,
impair,
or
supersede
any
law
enacted
by
a
state
to
regulate
or
tax
the
business
of
insurance.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
perhaps
common
law
would
be
included.
that
is
not
something
that
has
come
to
the
fore
in
this
case.
what
the
concern
was
in
the
dissents
in
southeastern
underwriters,
in
all
of
the
entreating
to
congress,
was
that
state
laws
would
be
inadvertently
repealed,
that
the
authority
of
the
states
to
regulate
and
tax
insurance
was
thrown
into
question.
indeed,
it
was
quite
revealing,
as
we
quote
at
the
top
of
page
19
in
our
brief,
that
senator
ferguson
himself
explained
this
provision
as
providing
that
no
federal
legislation
shall
by
implication
repeal
any
existing
state
law
unless
the
act
of
congress
specifically
so
provides,
so
it
was
to
preserve
the
authority
of
the
states
to
have
their
law
that
was
what
was
foremost
in
the
minds,
and
what
is
stated
here
in
the
act.
it
does
not
say
that
no
act
of
congress
shall
be
construed
to
impair
or
supersede
any
state
policy,
leaving
the
courts
open
to
speculation
about
negative
implications
of
what
the
state
failed
to
enact.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
we
tried
to
show
how
the
phrase
impair
a
law
was
used
in
historical
context
to
mean
in
effect
a
partial
repeal,
or
to
render
it
partially
ineffective.
it's
quite
difficult
for
federal
courts
construing
this
act
of
congress
to
determine
what
are
the
policies
of
federal
laws,
let
alone
to
try
to
come
to
grips
with
whether
a
federal
statute
should
be
thought
to
in
some
way
be
inconsistent
with
an
unstated
policy
of
the
state
law,
and--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--that
would
be
a
much
closer
case
than
this
one,
when
you'd
have
an
articulated
state
policy,
but
it
still
is
not
a
law
that
itself
regulates
the
business
of
insurance.
it
refrains
from
regulating,
and
to
the
extent
the
state
is
purporting
to
limit--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--that
would
be--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--the...
i
think
it
would
be,
as
i
say,
a
much
closer
case,
but
the
fact
is
the
state
is
not
in
a
position
to
tell
the
federal
government
what
remedies
it
can
provide
for
patterns
of
criminal
enterprises,
and
to
the
extent
that
it
purports
to
do
that,
it's
a
law
regulating
the
federal
government
rather
than
a
law
regulating
the
business
of
insurance.
the
argument
can
be
made,
but
we're
far
from
that
case
here.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
the
answer
is
that
the
statue
would
stand
because
the
courts
of
the
state,
which
are
the
state
courts,
not
the
federal
court,
would
still
not
be
able
to
award
treble
damages
under
state
law,
but--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--i
think
we
could
go
that
far,
yes,
but
we
don't
have
to
in
this
case,
because
the
state--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--they're
reading
negative--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--to
render
partially
ineffective
what
the
state
has
ordained
by
law.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
supersede
is
to
replace
with
something.
there's
a
slightly
different
connotation.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
invalidate
means
to
nullify
or
render
ineffective
without
necessarily
replacing,
but
it
doesn't
have
the
same
connotation
as
impaired,
doing
it
only
in
part.
invalidate
sounds
like
you're
doing...
you're
nullifying
the
whole
thing.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
the
connotation
is
somewhat
different.
they're
closely
related
terms.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--they
could
say
that,
but
that
isn't
what
it
says.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--that
is
quite
correct,
and
there's
a
special
provision
about
the
sherman
act.
that
special
provision
shows
the
limited
reach
of
the
rule
of
construction,
because
that
special
provision
says
that
with
respect
to
the
antitrust
laws
if
the
state
has
a
system
of
regulation
in
place
the
federal
antitrust
laws
are
ousted
except
for
boycott,
intimidation,
or
coercion
so
it
shows
that
the
special
rule
of
construction
is
something
of
a
much
more
limited
nature.
it
must
be
remembered
that
rico
is
not
just
a
one
way
street
with
respect
to
the
solvency
of
insurance
companies.
we
have
amicus
filings
before
this
court
by
receivers
of
looted
insurance
companies
who
are
using
civil
rico
to
try
to
get
assets
back
in
for
the
benefit
of
the
policyholders.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
the
conflict
is
about
whether
civil
rico
can
be
applied
to
claims
against
insurance
companies.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
it
would
be
much
better
to
have
a
uniform
application.
it's
true
that
treble
damages
might
be
available
under
massachusetts
law,
but
congress
has
seen
fit
to
provide
treble
damages
for
patterns
of
serious,
indictable
criminal
activity.
