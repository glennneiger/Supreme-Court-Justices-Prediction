mr.
g.
robert
blakey
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
my
name
is
g.
robert
blakey
and
i
represent
mary
forsyth
and
the
other
respondents.
before
i
begin
my
argument
directly,
and
i
do
want
to
talk
about
the
text
of
the
statute,
i
would
like
to
make
six
very
quick
points
about
the
insolvency
question
that
came
up
previously.
first,
the
case
that
my
colleague
was
referring
to
is
nevada
cement,
514
pacific
the
2nd,
1180.
the
case
holds
that
the
purpose
of
punitive
damages
in
nevada
law
is
to
vindicate
the
public
interest
without
annihilating
the
defendant.
second
point.
i
don't
see
how
he
has
standing
to
complain
about
the
possibility
of
an
insolvency.
he
has
conceded
he's
not
insolvent.
surely
as
he's
construing
the
word
impair,
it
would
be
impaired
as
applied,
so
if
we
got
it
in
a
company
where
triple
damages
would,
in
fact,
make
it
insolvent,
in
that
situation
you
would
have
an
impairment
under
his
test,
but
not
otherwise.
second,
i
cannot
see
where
he
finds
his
limitation
on
punitive
damages
in
nevada
law
since,
when
they
put
the
limitation
of
triple
damage,
triple
punitive
damages,
they
expressly
excepted
bad
faith
cases
against
insurance
companies.
this
legislature
has
recognized
the
possibility
of
unlimited
punitive
damages
subject
to
due
process.
third--
mr.
g.
robert
blakey
--the--
mr.
g.
robert
blakey
--no,
your
honor.
no.
let
me
see
if
i
can't
make
it
clear.
in
1987,
nevada
passed
tort
reform.
that
tort
reform
put
a
limitation
on
punitive
damages.
if
it's
in
excess
of
$100,000
you
can
only
get
three
times
the
actual.
if
it's
less
than
$100,000
actual,
you
cannot
get
more
than
$300,000.
mr.
g.
robert
blakey
that
limitation
has
an
exception
to
it.
that
exception
to
it
is
bad
faith
insurance,
in
which
those
limitations
don't
apply.
therefore,
the
voice
of
the
law
in
this
state
has
certainly
not
shown
that
kind
of
solicitude
towards
insurance
companies.
next
is...
and
this
i
have
to
apologize
for.
this
was
not
part
of
the
briefing,
and
so
i
didn't
get
it.
my
mind
has
the
fact
that
there's
an
oklahoma
district
court
opinion
that
says
you
cannot
collect
triple
damages
under
rico
in
a
bankruptcy,
and
if
that's
good
law,
it
seems
to
me
is
what
would
happen
in
this
case,
if
the
actual
damage
judgment
sent
them
into
bankruptcy,
we
couldn't
collect
rico
triple
damages
against
them
in
bankruptcy
anyway.
mr.
g.
robert
blakey
mr.
chief
justice,
that
is
in
fact
my
next
point.
most
every
state
has
an
insolvency
fund,
so
if
a
judgment
put
it
into
bankruptcy,
the
stock...
the
stockholders
might
lose,
but
the
policyholders
would
be
paid
by
the
insolvency
fund,
so
in
fact
we've
taken
into
consideration
in
nevada
law
the
danger
of
insolvency.
mr.
g.
robert
blakey
i
hesitate
to
opine
on
insurance
law
generally,
but
my
understanding
of
many
of
the
insolvency
funds
is,
they're
not
real
funds.
what
they
do
is
just,
they
assess
all
the
insurance
companies
for
whatever
has
to
be
paid.
they
do
not
necessarily
assess
the
other
policyholders,
except
in
the
sense
that
they
would
assess
all
policyholders
generally.
the
last
two
points
i
make,
and
it
is
extremely
quick,
is
his
notion
that
actual
damages
makes
somebody
whole
flies
into
the
face
of
all
economic
analysis.
it
doesn't
discount
the
opportunity
cost
and
others,
and
i
would
refer
the
court
on
that
point
to
an
able
opinion
by
judge
easterbrook
in
the
context
of
a
rico
case,
and
it
is
mosler
v.
the
s&p
enterprises,
and
the
relevant
page
is
888
fed.
2d
at
1143-44.
and
as
to
the
general
economic
analysis
of
the
effect
of
triple
damages,
the
studies
particularly
under
the
antitrust
law
is,
they
result
in
actual
settlements
and
actual
damage.
accordingly,
you
probably
need
triple
damages
to
make
a
plaintiff
whole.
actual
damages--
mr.
g.
robert
blakey
--pardon?
mr.
g.
robert
blakey
yes,
and
if
you
don't
have
triple
damages,
what
you
end
up
is
some
discount
of
actual
damages,
so
actual
damages,
a
lot
of...
like
a
lot
of
phrases
in
the
law,
actual
doesn't
really
mean
actual.
to
return
to
my
argument,
respondents'
construction
of
impair
is
premised
on
a
misconstruction
of
the
purposes
of
the
mccarran
ferguson
act,
and
is
fundamentally
inconsistent
with
the
statute.
as
a
whole--
mr.
g.
robert
blakey
--yes.
mr.
g.
robert
blakey
yes.
it's
inconsistent
with
the
statute
as
a
whole,
the
section
of
which
it
is
a
part,
and
the
phrasing
in
which
it
is
embedded.
respondents
argue
that
the
purpose
of
the
mccarran
ferguson
act
was
to
privilege
state
law
over
federal
law.
well,
that's
just
not
true.
if
you
look
at
the
final
text
of
the
statute,
it
is
a
carefully
crafted
compromise
that
in
some
situations
does
that,
and
in
others
doesn't,
and
i've
asked
the
clerk
to
have
available
to
each
of
you
respondents'
exhibit
number
1,
which
is
the
actual
text
of
the
statute
from
the
statutes
at
large,
and
you
can
see
it
right
on
the
face
of
the
statute.
i've
highlighted
the
five
places
in
that
statute
that
adjust
the
relationship
between
federal
and
state
law.
you
start
at
the
bottom.
section
4
preserves
labor
law
under
a
standard
of,
to
affect
in
any
manner.
that's
the
typical
preemption
of
federal
labor
law
of
all
state
law.
that's
no
privileges
of
state
law
in
that.
section
3(b)
preserves
the
sherman
act
insofar
as
agreements
to
boycott
and
coerce
or
intimidate
is
there.
it's
fully
applicable
under
this
court's
jurisprudence
under
conflict--
if
you
look
at
section
3(a),
he
got
his
reverse
field
preemption
for
a
temporary
period
of
time
in
order
that
the
states
could
enact
laws.
and
finally,
we
move
up
to
the
crucial
section,
but
my
point
has
been,
this
is
a
carefully
balanced
statute
that
privileges
federal
law
sometimes
and
state
law
the
other,
and
for
him
to
want
to
interpret
it
in
light
of
one
of
its
purposes
and
not
its
others
is
to
forget
that
this
is
a
compromise,
not
a
recognition
of
a
jurisprudential
proposition
that
state
law
is
more
important
than
federal.
if
we
look
at
the
crucial
language
in
the
statute...
your
honors,
this
is
section
2(b)...
we
have
to
look
at
two
points
in
it.
one,
the
crucial
language,
to
invalidate,
impair,
or
supersede.
let's
take
his
common
ground
that
supersede
means
to
displace,
that
invalidate
means
to
eliminate
but
not
displace.
if
you
give
impair
the
kind
of
open
ended,
broad
definition
that
he
would
give
it,
there's
no
role
left
to
play
for
invalidate
and
supersede.
it's
sucked
right
out
of
the
statute.
indeed--
mr.
g.
robert
blakey
--but
in
that
case,
since
impair
is
met
at
a
lesser
stage,
every
time
where
you've
had
a
supersession,
every
time
when
you've
had
an
invalidation,
you'd
also
have
an
impairment.
accordingly,
you
would
never
spend
any
time
in
the
future
in
looking
at
the
other
two
statutory
words.
it
seems
to
me
the
most
plausible
reading
of
this
phrase
is,
these
are
three
alternative
but
not
mutually
exclusive
ways
that
state
law
or
federal
law
could
upset
state
law.
mr.
g.
robert
blakey
well,
there's
a
connotation
that's
different.
mr.
g.
robert
blakey
the
answer,
as
i
understand
the
question,
is,
my
position
is
that
impairment
would
take
place
in
all
three
situations.
any
time
you
were
superseded,
you
would
be
impaired.
any
time
you
were
invalidated,
you
would
be
impaired.
sometimes
under
his
construction
you
would
be
impaired
but
not
invalidated
and
not
superseded.
therefore,
the
only
operative
word
in
the
phrase
would
be
impaired,
and
the
normal
assumption
is--
mr.
g.
robert
blakey
--oh,
my
view...
i'm
sorry,
justice
stevenson.
my
view
is,
these
are
three
alternative
ways,
not
mutually
exclusive,
in
which
you
can
bring
about
a
conflict
between
state
and
federal
law.
mr.
g.
robert
blakey
yes.
in
other
words,
when
the
impairment
met
a
conflict,
it
didn't
supersede,
it
didn't
invalidate,
but
it
arose
to
the
level
of
a
conflict,
you
couldn't
follow
federal
law
and
state
law,
then
that's
what
it
would...
exactly
impairment
would
mean.
what
he's
done
is,
he's
unhooked
impairment
from
any
limitation.
indeed,
he
suggests
that
the
word
impair
is
derived
from
3270,
which
was
the
original
mccarran
ferguson
act
as
introduced,
but
if
you
go
to
3270,
what
it
said
in
that
context
was,
apply
to
or
in
anywise
to
repair...
impair,
and
what
happened
between
3270
and
s.
340
is
that
in
anywise
was
dropped
out,
and
this
court's
jurisprudence
teaches
that
if
you
drop
language
out,
it's
presumed
to
be
deliberate.
mr.
g.
robert
blakey
no.
no,
on
the
contrary.
i
think
that
invalidate...
these
words
are
not
necessarily
mutually
exclusive,
but
my
argument
is
that
if
impair
is
construed
as
he
does,
impair
would
be
the
only
operative
word.
mr.
g.
robert
blakey
no.
what
i'm--
mr.
g.
robert
blakey
--okay.
if...
suppose,
in
his
example,
the
state
legislature
squarely
and
unequivocally
said
as
against
insurance
companies
in
this
state,
only
actual
damages
can
be
recovered,
and
at
that
time
it
abolished
the
state
common
law
and
it
put
an
exception
in
the
state
rico
so
there
wasn't
insurance
fraud
there,
and
the
only
way
you
could
get...
or
even
more
so,
the
only
remedy
under
state
law
would
be
an
administrative
sanction.
the
only
remedy
would
be
an
administrative
sanction.
i'm
inclined
to
think
in
that
situation
he
would
have
a
conflict.
if
he's
got
a
policy
decision
by
the
state
legislature
that
we're
only
to
do
administrative
sanctions
against
insurance
companies.
that
might
rise
to
the
level
of
a
conflict.
mr.
g.
robert
blakey
yes.
mr.
g.
robert
blakey
okay.
if
we
take
his
reading
of
the
statute,
this
impair,
at
this
level
of
broadness,
he
gives
no
function
to
the
proviso
in
this
section.
the
proviso
in
this
section
says,
to
the
extent
that
the
states
have
enacted
antitrust
type
statutes,
to
that
extent
state
law
does
trump
federal
law,
but
to
the
extent
that
they've
acted
it,
that
would
mean,
in
effect,
impair,
as
he's
defined
it.
therefore,
his
reading
of
impair
in
effect--
mr.
g.
robert
blakey
--i
apologize.
humana's
construction
of
the
statute
would
in
effect
read
as
follows:
no
act
of
congress
shall
be
applicable
to
the
business
of
insurance
if
it
impairs
such
business
regulated
by
state
law,
or
which
is
state
law
otherwise
enacted
for
the
purpose
of
the
business.
you
cut
out
of
it,
to
the
extent
that
you
cut
out
of
it
invalidate,
you
cut
out
impair,
and
you
cut
out
of
it
supersede.
that's
his
definition
of
impair.
that
cannot
be
what
it
means.
mr.
g.
robert
blakey
well,
this
court's
teaching...
yes
and
no.
mr.
g.
robert
blakey
well,
preemption
in
this
court...
well,
i'm
uncomfortable
with
the
word
preemption,
because
that's
a
whig's
view
of
history,
to
read
back
into
a
1945
statute
preemption
jurisprudence.
they
discussed
it
at
the
time
in
terms
of
conflict.
i
am
more
comfortable
discussing
it
in
terms
of
conflict.
nevertheless,
this
court's
jurisprudence
in
english
suggested
that
there
were
three
not
mutually
exclusive
ways
to
preempt,
express,
field,
and
conflict,
and
we
think
that
this
is
conflict,
and
the
reason
we
think
that
this
is
conflict
is
that
the
contemporary
jurisprudence
of
this
court
discussed
this
in
terms
of
conflict.
justices
acting
in
dissent
actually
said,
only
actual
conflict
impaired--
mr.
g.
robert
blakey
--with
all
due
respect,
justice
breyer,
i
think
this
court
ought
to
spend
its
time
interpreting
federal
law
and
not
get
into
a
quagmire
of
state
law,
and
this
is
not
only
a
quagmire
of
state
law,
it's
a
quagmire
of--
mr.
g.
robert
blakey
--actually,
it's
both.
i'm
willing
to
say
that
i
think
it's
a
direct
conflict
between
federal
and
state
law
such
that
you
couldn't
do
both.
that's
my
interpretation.
but
if
i
accept
his
impair
to
the
degree
of
upset
the
balance,
there
are
two
things
presupposed,
first
that
there
was
a
balance,
and
second
that
it
was
upset,
and
there
are
not
one
but
several
reasons
to
suggest
that
there
was
no
balance.
mr.
g.
robert
blakey
well,
in
national
securities,
this
court
held
that
impair
in
the
mccarran
ferguson
act
meant
only
direct
impair,
and
saw
it
in
terms
of
this
kind
of,
you
can't
do
both.
this
court
in
fabe
saw
that
there
was
a
conflict
by
seeing
it
in
terms
of
both.
i
see
that
my
time
is
almost
exhausted.
i
would
suggest
to
you
that
there
is
no
balance,
1)
because
the
face
of
the
state
insurance
code
recognizes
that
other
sanctions
outside
of
the
code
are
possible,
in
fact,
now
has
a
private
claim
for
relief.
second,
there's
no
indication
that
the
common
law
claims
for
relief
with
punitive
damages
has
been
set
aside,
and
the
state
rico
statute
specifically
includes
obtaining
money
by
false
pretenses,
and
if
the
court
wants
a
case
close
to
this
fact
situation,
it
is
bright
v.
the
sheriff,
521
pacific
the
2d,
371.
they
suggest
there's
no
obtaining
money
by
false
pretenses
because
we're
complaining
about
what
they
didn't
give
us.
we're
also
complaining
about
what
they
caused
us
to
give
them
by
virtue
of
fraud.
i
would
suggest
that
it
would
be
unwise
to
go
down
the
route
of
conflict
of
this
impairment
jurisprudence.
you've
got
really
clear
jurisprudence
on
conflict.
you
have
silkwood,
arc,
english,
and
cippolone,
all
of
which
have
looked
to
see
the
relationship
between
federal
and
state
law,
and
have
preserved
as
much
as
possible
state
law.
as
justice
o'connor
said
in
her
concurring
opinion
in
medtronic,
there's
no
necessary
conflict
between
a
federal
administrative
remedy
and
state
torts.
you
just...
quote,
an
additional
damage
remedy
is
another
reason
to
comply.
let
me
conclude
by
making
a
reference
to
judge
learned
hand.
he
says
in
his
essay
on
the
contribution
of
an
independent
judiciary
to
civilization
that
enacted
law...
and
he
could
have
been
talking
about
the
mccarran
ferguson
act...
is
not
enactment
of
eternal
principles
of
jurisprudence.
it's
the
resolution
of
a
conflict,
and
that
compromise,
that
conflict
ought
not
to
be
broadened
or
narrowed.
it
ought
to
be
read
loyally
as
the
language
indicates
until
such
time
as
it
is
changed
by
the
process
that
created
it.
in
1944,
this
industry
came
to
congress
to
get
an
exemption,
and
they
didn't
get
it.
in
1989,
this
industry
is
coming
to
this
court
to
get
an
exemption.
they
ought
not
get
from
this
court
what
they
could
not
get
from
congress.
thank
you.
