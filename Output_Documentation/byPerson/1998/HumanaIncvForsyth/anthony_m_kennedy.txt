is
it
common
ground
here
among
the
parties
that
we
do
have
before
us
a
state
law
that's
for
the
business
of
regulating...
for
the
purpose
of
regulating
the
business
of
insurance?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
that
is
the
nevada
law
which
prohibits
the
insurance
companies
to
defraud
their
policyholders?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
of
course,
that's
just
grammar.
suppose
it
just
said
no
court
in
this
state
shall
enter
any
judgment
for
punitive
damages
or
for
damages
more
than
compensatory
damages.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
if
that's
the
law,
how
do
we
then
interpret
the
word
impair
to
resolve
that
hypothetical
problem?
