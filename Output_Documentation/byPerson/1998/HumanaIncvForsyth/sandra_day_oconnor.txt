well,
how
do
you
say
we
should
look
at
the
level
of
conflict
between
federal
and
state
law
to
determine
impairment?
i
mean,
one
way
to
look
at
this
is
that
the
federal
rico
law
gives
a
remedy
that
is
not
precluded
by
state
law,
and
that
may
be
supplemental
but
doesn't
impair
the
state
scheme.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
i
can
understand
if
nevada
had
passed
some
statutory
provision
in
expressing
its
intent
that
its
state
remedies
be
exclusive,
that
this
would
be
an
impairment,
but
absent
that,
it
isn't
so
clear
to
me
that
allowing
the
federal
remedy
is
an
impairment.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
it
doesn't
have
to,
but
when
it's
enacting
its
own
laws
it
can
certainly
make
it
clear.
in
the
meantime,
how
is
it
an
impairment?
