mr.
colbert.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
colbert,
what
is
your
authority
for
saying
that
nevada
does
not
allow
punitive
damages
where
they
would
threaten
the
solvency
of
the
insurance
company?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
it
a
case
from
the
nevada
supreme
court?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it
isn't
in
your
brief?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--we'll
struggle
even
harder
if
we
can't
find
the
case.
[laughter]
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--mr.
colbert,
what
if
a
nevada
trial
judge
had
before
him
a
case
like
this
and
the
insurance
company
says,
well,
the
recovery...
we
don't
want
you
to
charge
on
punitive
damages
because
the
recovery
might
threaten
our
solvency.
what
sort
of
an
inquiry
would
the
trial
judge
make
to
decide
whether
or
not
to
allow
punitive
damages?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes,
thank
you,
mr.
colbert.
we'll
resume

mr.
blakey.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
do
insurance
companies
go
into
ordinary
bankruptcy
if
there's
an
insolvency
proceeding
under
state
law?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
don't
know
that
i
agree
with
you,
mr.
blakey,
on
that.
it
seems
to
me
impair
could
be
having
a
lesser
effect,
short
of
invalidation
or
of
superseding,
but
nonetheless
impairing.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
are
you
saying
that
each
word
means
something
different?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
could
you
answer
the
question?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes,
i
asked
your
view.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
does
each
word,
each
of
those
three
verbs
have
a
separate
meaning,
do
you
think?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
then
mr.
blakey,
when
you
say
he,
humana
i
guess
is
a
corporation,
and
your
opposing
counsel,
is
that
who
you're
referring
to?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
think
it
might
be
better
to
refer
to
him
as
counsel.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
blakey,
my
suggestion
was
that
you
refer
either
to
the
petitioner
or--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
blakey.
mr.
wallace,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
emphasized
the
word
law
when
you
read
that.
does
that
mean
to
say
that
a
common
law
decision
of
a
court
would
not
be
regarded
as
law
by
you?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
think
you've
answered
the
question,
mr.
wallace.
thank
you.
mr.
colbert,
you
have
4
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
colbert.
the
case
is
submitted.
