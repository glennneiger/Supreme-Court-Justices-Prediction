this
case
concerns
the
employee
retirement
income
security
act
erisa
is
its
acronym.
it
is
complex
legislation
and
it
is
a
constant
supplier
of
questions
in
need
of
adjudication.
two
of
erisa's
most
litigated
clauses,
the
preemptions
clause
and
the
saving
clause
are
again
at
issue.
the
preemption
clause
broadly
states
that
erisa
provisions
shall
supersede
state
laws
that
relate
to
any
employee
benefit
plan.
the
saving
clause
prays
with
similar
breadth
exempts
from
preemption
"any
law
of
any
state
which
regulates
insurance".
the
key
words
"regulate
insurance"
in
the
saving
clause
and
relate
to
in
the
preemption
clause
require
interpretation
for
their
meaning
is
not
plain.
to
apply
erisa
sensibly
we
must
measure
its
key
words
in
context.
the
context
here
is
a
suit
to
recover
disability
benefits
under
an
erisa-governed
policy
issued
by
the
defendant-petitioner
unum
life
insurance
company.
plaintiff-respondent,
john
ward
submitted
his
proof
of
disability
claim
to
unum
outside
the
time
limit
set
in
the
policy,
and
unum
therefore
denied
ward's
application
for
benefits.
ruling
in
ward's
favor
and
reversing
the
district
court's
judgment
for
unum,
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
relied
on
decisional
law
in
california,
the
state
in
which
ward
worked.
we
affirm
the
court
of
appeals'
judgment
in
prime
part.
the
ninth
circuit's
judgment
rested
on
two
grounds.
that
court
relied
first
on
california's
"notice-prejudice"
rule,
under
which
an
insurer
cannot
avoid
liability
although
the
proof
of
claim
is
untimely,
unless
the
insurer
shows
it
was
prejudiced
by
the
delay.
the
"notice-prejudice"
rule
is
saved
from
erisa
preemption,
the
court
of
appeals
held,
because
it
is
law
which
regulates
insurance.
we
agree.
by
its
very
terms,
the
"notice-prejudice"
rule
is
specifically
directed
at
the
insurance
industr.
our
opinion
explains
in
detail
why
we
are
satisfied
that
the
"notice-prejudice"
rule
is
not
simply
an
industry-specific
application
of
the
general
principle
that
law
abhors
a
forfeiture
rather
it
is
a
notably
stringent
adaptation
of
that
principle
of
rule
made
mandatory
only
for
insurance
contracts.
the
court
of
appeals
stated
a
second
contingent
ground
for
reversing
the
district
court's
judgment
for
unum,
one
that
would
come
into
play
only
if
on
remand
the
insurer
proved
prejudice
due
to
the
delayed
notice.
under
california
decisions,
the
ninth
circuit
said,
an
employer
could
be
deemed
an
agent
of
the
insurer
in
administering
group
insurance
policies.
ward's
employer
knew
of
his
disability
within
the
time
the
policy
allowed
for
proof
of
claim.
the
generally
applicable
agency
law
of
california
the
ninth
circuit
held,
does
not
relate
to
employee
benefit
plans,
and
therefore
is
not
preempted
by
erisa.
we
disagree
with
this
contingent
ruling
deeming
the
employer
or
the
agent
of
the
insurer
would
have
a
marked
effect
on
plan
administration,
forcing
the
employer
to
assume
a
role
with
attendant
legal
duties
and
consequences
that
the
employer
had
not
bargained
for.
we
are
therefore
satisfied
that
the
california
agency
law
involved,
does
relate
to
erisa
plans
and
accordingly
does
not
escape
preemption.
in
sum,
we
affirm
on
the
main
ground
the
"notice-prejudice"
rule
and
reverse
on
the
contingent
employer
as
agent
holding.
the
opinion
of
the
court
is
unanimous.
