unknown
speaker
well,
you
do
agree
that,
even
under
erisa,
a
state
law
that
satisfies
mccarran-ferguson
act
requirements
is
not
preempted?
there
is
a
savings
clause?
unknown
speaker
not
just
the
broad
general
purpose
of
erisa,
because
if
you
did
that
wouldn't
you
have
to
call
every
one
of
them
in
favor
of
the
beneficiary,
because
the
purpose
of
erisa
was
to
protect
people's
insurance,
workers'
insurance,
right?
isn't
that
the...
i
mean,
erisa
wasn't
passed
to
make
life
easy
for
insurers.
unknown
speaker
well,
what
does
the
savings
clause
save?
one
argument
that
you
made
that
i
thought
certainly
would
require
modification
is
that
if
you
have
a
policy
term
and
it's
something
written
into
the
policy,
that
wipes
away
the
savings
clause.
and
that
can't
be
right.
it's
not
given
to
private
ordering
to
do
away
with
the
savings
clause.
unknown
speaker
why
couldn't
the
federal
scheme
adopt
the
same
rule
as
california?
i
mean,
if
this
is
a
proposition
of
general
contract
law
in
california
and
other
states,
would
xx
objection
to
the
federal
courts...
i
mean,
let's
s
xx
manded
to
the
ninth
circuit
and
they
say:
i
guess
you're
right,
we
shouldn't
have
applied
this
provision
of
california
law;
but
as
it
happens,
federal
law's
the
same
way.
would
that
be
all
right?
unknown
speaker
the
one
you
just
talked
on.
unknown
speaker
may
i
interrupt
just
for
one
question.
i
just
don't
know
the
answer
because
i
don't
have
the
act
clearly
enough
in
mind.
was
the
term
of
the
act,
the
term
that
you
just
used,
"written
plan
instrument",
as
distinct
from
something
like,
say,
"terms
of
the
plan",
a
more
generic
term?
unknown
speaker
so
it's
referring
to
the
words.
what
i'm
getting
at
is,
and
i
think
you've
answered
my...
the
question
that
was
in
the
back
of
my
mind...
is
would
we
have
to
say
that
the
terms
of
the
plan
as
erisa
used
it
might
be
the
terms
of
the
plan
as
modified
by
applicable
state
law?
i
think
your
answer
implicit
in
what
you
said
is
no,
because
erisa
is
referring
to
the
document
and
the
document
cannot
possibly
include
an
accommodation
of
state
law,
a
modification
of
its
terms.
is
that
fair?
unknown
speaker
right.
i'm
jumping
ahead.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
if
erisa
uses
the
word
"document",
that's...
even
without
any
other
explication
from
us,
that's
pretty
strong
language
for
your
position.
unknown
speaker
okay.
and
the
savings
clause
is
shoved
aside,
then,
every
time
the
plan
document...
suppose
california
law
had
said
the
people
who
make
benefit
claims
take
time
to
get
their
act
together,
so
we
are
mandating
a
two-year
proof
of
claim
period,
and
if
insurers
put
in
their
policies
anything
less
than
that
it
doesn't
count.
suppose
that
were
the
california
law
and
california
said,
we
are
adopting
this
to
regulate
insurance,
to
regulate
insurance
sales
in
this
state;
insurer,
you
must
give
everybody
two
years.
but
in
your
erisa
plan
you
have
1
year
and
180
days.
unknown
speaker
my
question
is
this
very
specific
one.
unknown
speaker
you
must
give
people
two
years
to
put
in
a
proof
of
claim.
unknown
speaker
no,
it
isn't
how
they
interpret
it.
it
says
it's
x'ed
out
of
the
plan.
the
plan
cannot
have
such
language.
there's
nothing
to
construe.
but
saved
is
the
state
statute,
so
the
state
statute
displaces
the
term
of
the
plan,
just
as
in
massachusetts-metropolitan
life.
they
didn't
cover
mental
health,
the
law
says,
the
state
law,
says
you
must
cover
mental
health.
so
i'm
giving
you
that
same
situation.
it's
not...
the
plan
is
out.
the
state
law
is
written
into
the
contract.
unknown
speaker
not
in
your
contract.
we
don't
care
whether
you
put
it
in
your
contract.
that's
the
law
of
this
state.
something
else
is
void.
unknown
speaker
it
doesn't
say
anything
about
deem
or
whatever
your
language.
it
says
every
insured
shall
be
given
by
every
insurer
a
minimum
of
two
years
to
put
in
a
proof
of
claim.
unknown
speaker
then
you're
saying
that
california
courts,
because
it's
a
court-made
rule
that
we're
dealing
with,
notice
and
prejudice,
they
just
used
the
wrong
words.
they
should
have
said,
our
rule
is,
notwithstanding
anything
that's
in
an
insurance
contract,
no
insurer
can
claim
a
delay
unless
the
delay
prejudiced
the
insurer.
unknown
speaker
yes,
that's
the
rule.
but
the
court
says,
now,
we
want
you
to
understand
that
if
you
say
anything
to
the
contrary
in
your
policy
that's
void.
unknown
speaker
well,
would
the
answer
be
different
if
it
did?
that
seems
just
caviling.
unknown
speaker
well,
let's
make
it
even
easier
than
that.
i
don't
know
how
it
works
in
california,
but
in
many,
maybe
most,
states,
the
policy
terms
have
to
be
submitted
to
the
insurance
commissioner
before
a
policy
can
be
sold
using
those
terms.
unknown
speaker
the
commissioner
says:
i
won't
approve
the
policy.
no
policy
gets
approved
unless
it
has
these
particular
terms
in
it:
time
is
not
of
the
essence
absent
prejudice.
and
in
that
case
do
you
concede
that
we
would
not
even
have
the
issue
in
front
of
us
because
it
would
have
been
perfectly
proper
under
erisa
for
california
to
say
you
can't
sell
the
policy;
if
they
did
sell
the
policy,
it
would
have
the
terms
in
it
that
we're
arguing
about?
unknown
speaker
i
see
your
argument.
unknown
speaker
but
that's
ultimately,
i
suppose,
your
answer
to
justice
cinsburg's
question,
too,
then.
i
mean,
you're
not
caviling,
because
you
say
at
the
end
of
the
day,
no
matter
how
you
do
it,
if
the
state
purports
to
require
this
term,
it
is
in
fact
violating
the
plenary
grant
of
authority
over
administration,
which
is
federal.
unknown
speaker
i'm
sure
i'm
not.
unknown
speaker
well,
supposing
that
a
state
wanted
to
impose
on
your
client
this
requirement
of
notice
and
prejudice
in
submitting
claims.
is
there
any
way
it
could
do
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
but
that's
not
an
answer
in
a
court.
unknown
speaker
so
what
is
your
answer
to
my
question,
that
there
is
no
way
a
state
can
legally
require
the
sort
of
notice
and
prejudice
with
respect
to
claims
that
california
has
here?
unknown
speaker
so
that
your
case...
there's
a
lot
of
talk
in
the
briefs
about
this
being
a
common
law
rule.
that's
really
irrelevant
to
your
position?
it'd
be
the
same
if
it
were
a
statute
or
a
regulation
of
the
insurance
commissioner
of
california;
is
that
correct?
unknown
speaker
i
thought
you
told
the
chief
it
was.
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
would
produce
the
same
result
in
your
view--
unknown
speaker
--whether
it
were
a
common
law
rule,
a
statute,
or
a
regulation
by
an
insurance
commissioner?
unknown
speaker
i
don't
understand
that
because
what
business
is
it
of
the
federal
statute
what...
how
a
state
makes
its
law,
whether
the
state
makes
its
law
through
its
courts,
through
its
administrative
agencies,
through
its
legislature.
i
thought
erisa
itself
makes
that
clear,
that
the
savings
clause
saves
state
law,
and
then
it's
up
to
the
state,
not
the
feds,
to
tell
the
state
how
it's
going
to
go
about
making
its
laws.
doesn't
erisa
save
court
law
as
well
as
administrative
law
as
well
as...
erisa
doesn't
put
a
statute
on
a
higher
plane
than
a
court
decision,
does
it?
unknown
speaker
that's
back
to
swift
against
tyson,
you
know,
where
a
statute
had
one
level
for
diversity
jurisdiction,
but
that
a
common
law
didn't.
it
seems
to
me
it
would
be
unusual
for
congress
to
have
reimposed
that
sort
of
requirement.
unknown
speaker
general
common
laws.
mr.
kayatta,
am
i
not
correct
that
you
would
say
a
statute
would
be
just
as
bad
under
your
"doesn't
regulate
insurance"
theory
if
the
statute
were
framed
not
as
specifically
as
justice
ginsburg's
proposal,
but
it
was
a
statute
which
said
in
all
contracts,
not
just
insurance
contracts,
in
all
contracts
either
party...
well,
time
is
not
of
the
essence
unless
there's
prejudice?
unknown
speaker
you
would
say
that
that
fails
for
two
reasons,
both
because
it
impinges
upon
the
administration
of
the
scheme
which
is
given
to
the
secretary
and,
secondly,
because
it
does
not
regulate
insurance.
unknown
speaker
it's
a
general
statute.
unknown
speaker
what's
special
about
this?
that
is,
if
i
assume,
which
i
think
i
am
at
the
moment,
california
has
a
law
and
the
law
says
insurance
contracts,
but
not
others,
that
have
in
them
a
phrase
that
says
you
have
to
notify
us
at
a
certain
point
can
only
be
read
to
mean
you
have
to
notify
us
or
you
still
win
even
if
you
miss
the
deadline
unless
we're
prejudiced...
that's
the
rule,
right?
that's
the
rule
we're
talking
about?
unknown
speaker
and
it
only
applies
to
insurance
companies,
says
the
sg.
they
haven't
found
one
case
that
applies
to
anything
else.
unknown
speaker
and
they've
found
no
case
in
their
research
that
says
it
applies
to
anything
else.
unknown
speaker
well,
what
i
have
them
as
saying
is:
"our
survey
of
california
law
reveals
no
cases
where
the
state
courts
applied
the
notice
prejudice
rule
as
such--
"
unknown
speaker
--"#
outside
the"...
oh,
"as
such"?
unknown
speaker
okay,
okay.
let's
now
make
mine
an
assumption.
so
we
assume
it's
an
insurance
contract.
now,
we
know
that
insurance
contracts,
the
states
regulate
them
to
death.
i
mean,
that
may
be
good,
but
i
mean
they
have
dozens
and
dozens
and
dozens
of
regulations.
you
have
to
have
big
print
and
you
have
to
have
this
or
that.
well,
fine.
so
what's
special
about
your
regulation?
why
does
502,
which
just
says
you
have
to
have
a
procedure
for
recovery,
suddenly
preempt
your
regulation
when
it
doesn't
preempt
any
one
of
a
thousand
others
that
govern
when
you
can
recover
against
an
insurance
company,
when
you
can't
recover,
what
their
contract
has
to
say,
what
print
it
has
to
be
in,
whether
it
has
to
be
in
english?
i
like
that
one.
you
know,
what's
special?
unknown
speaker
well,
why
is
it
more
of
a
procedure,
a
claims
administration
procedure,
to
say,
insurance
company,
your
contract
allows
you
to
enforce
that
notice
requirement
only
when
there
is
prejudice,
than
to
say,
insurance
company,
that
contract
means
you
still
have
to
pay
unless
it's
written
in
plain
english,
unless
it
has
four-point
type,
unless?
why
is
the
one
procedure,
but
the
other
isn't?
unknown
speaker
well,
this
is
a
502
action.
it
doesn't
mean
that
there
still
can't
be
a
rule
regulating
insurance,
the
business
of
insurance,
that
is
applicable.
unknown
speaker
they
did
bring
it
under
520.
unknown
speaker
but
this
isn't
a
remedy.
it's
not...
they're
not
bringing
an
action
under
california
whatever
private
right
of
action.
they're
bringing
an
action
under
erisa,
and
they
say
the
statute's
got
this
savings
clause
contemplating
that
there
will
be
in
actions
under
erisa
an
element
for
state
law.
and
certainly
there
was
a
big
impact
of
state
law
in
the
metropolitan
life.
it
really
had
a
much
more,
at
least
as
far
as
i
can
understand
it,
much
more
intrusive
impact
on
the
insurance
company
than
this
notice
and
prejudice.
unknown
speaker
what
state
law
would
govern?
presumably
it
would
be
the
state
law
of
each
claimant?
would
that
be
it?
i
mean,
would
more
than
one
state
law
apply
to
this,
to
this
document?
unknown
speaker
and
they
can
both
apply
to
the
same
plan,
because...
because
the
claimants
are
in
different
states.
unknown
speaker
301
doesn't
have
a
savings
clause
and
that's...
what
you're
trying
to
say
is
the
savings
clause
cannot
operate
at
all
when
it
comes
to
plan
administration?
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
we
do
have
it.
we
do
have
the
savings
clause.
unknown
speaker
i
don't
see
anything
in
502
that
refers
to
301.
unknown
speaker
where
did
it
say
that?
unknown
speaker
let's
talk
about
the
statute.
unknown
speaker
so
the
argument
based
on,
in
effect,
on
the
word
"document"
is
essentially
a
circular
argument?
unknown
speaker
could
the
secretary
adopt
regulations
like
the
notice
prejudice
rule
and
then
occupy
the
field?
unknown
speaker
do
other
states
have
similar
notice
prejudice
rules,
to
your
knowledge?
unknown
speaker
what
about
this
"as
such"?
he
did
throw
me
a
little
bit
with
that.
i
mean,
you
said,
well,
really
this...
california
applies
this
notice
prejudice
rule
only
to
insurance
companies.
that's
how
i
read
your
statement.
unknown
speaker
and
then
mr.
kayatta
said,
well,
you
said
we
haven't
found
a
case
in
california
that
applies
the
rule
"as
such".
unknown
speaker
well,
then
he
says,
well,
once
you
say
that,
his
point
is
that,
well,
this
is
just
like,
you
know,
a
rule
that
says
offer
is
good
on
acceptance
or
something.
i
mean,
it's
a
general
principle
of
contract
law
and
that
doesn't
fall
within
any
special
insurance
clause,
although
of
course
insurance
companies,
like
other
companies,
are
bound
by
it.
unknown
speaker
it's
not
just
a
branch,
then,
of
the
condition
subsequent
law?
unknown
speaker
and
we
have
a
court
of
appeals
holding
to
that
effect.
unknown
speaker
interpreting
state
law.
unknown
speaker
which
we
presume
is
correct.
unknown
speaker
mr.
kneedler,
applying
the
same
principles,
do
you
think
that
california's
elfstrom
rule
is
one
that
applies
general
agency
principles
or
is
insurance-specific?
unknown
speaker
are
you
going
to
address
whether
this
notice
prejudice
rule
is
something
regulating
the
business
of
insurance?
unknown
speaker
it
doesn't
alter
the
allocation
of
risks
insured
against
at
all.
i
mean,
those
other
things
do.
those
other
things
say
certain
risks
the
insurance
company
is
going
to
have
to
take.
that
is,
certain
aspects
of
the
risk
insured
against.
the
risk
insured
against
here
is
not
the
risk
of
how
late
you
make
the
claim.
unknown
speaker
what
is
the
rule?
on
the
one
hand,
the
rule
is,
it
seems
to
be
a
rule
of
law
that
the
employer
is
always
the
agent
of
the
insurance
company,
but
the
ninth
circuit
didn't
treat
it
that
way--
unknown
speaker
--do
you
know
which
it
is
in
california?
is
it
a
rule
of
law
or
is
it
a
matter
of
fact?
unknown
speaker
well,
if
we're
going
to
believe
the
ninth
circuit
for
one
thing,
why
don't
we
believe
them
for
the
other
one?
unknown
speaker
well,
you
say
they
treated
it
that
way.
did
they
treat
it
as
something
that
they
shouldn't
have
treated
it
as?
unknown
speaker
i
mean,
i
think
we
have
to
assume
that
they
applied
the
state
law
properly.
unknown
speaker
is
that
a
question
of
coverage
or
a
condition
for
the
payment
of
benefits?
i
mean,
when
we
usually
talk
about
coverage
under
the
policy
we
usually
refer
to
the
substantive
terms...
what
kinds
of
injuries,
disabilities,
and
so
on
are
covered.
is
it
fair,
then,
to
characterize
it
as
a
coverage
provision?
unknown
speaker
well,
it
alters
the
terms,
but
it
doesn't
necessarily
alter
the
coverage.
i
mean,
the
two...
the
terms
include
more
than
what
the
coverage
is.
they
include,
you
know,
when
you
have
to
apply.
unknown
speaker
where
you
have
to
mail
your
notice,
is
that...
is
that
a
coverage
provision?
unknown
speaker
they
could
say
the
same
thing
about
the
wrong
address:
you
sent
your
thing
to
the
wrong
address
and
therefore
you're
not
covered.
so
that's
a
coverage
provision,
too.
unknown
speaker
doesn't
that...
doesn't
that
change
the
scope
of
the
insurance
company's
risk?
i
mean,
he's
at
risk
only
if,
only
if
money
to
cover
the
loss
is
not
collected
from
somebody
else.
unknown
speaker
well,
but
the
insurance
company's
risk
is
considerably
changed.
unknown
speaker
no,
i
think
it
goes
to
the
allocation
of
risk
between
the
two.
you
can
also
say
that
the
risk
is
changed
if
some
claims
that
have
come
in
late
have
to
be
paid
or
if
they're
not.
i
mean,
if
you
want
to
press
the
thing.
unknown
speaker
he
would
like
to
describe
it,
i
take
it,
as
simply
a
branch
of
contract
law,
where
courts
have,
with
contracts
of
adhesion
for
example,
tried
to
make
certain
that
defendants
can't
avoid
their
bargain
through
what
courts
have
considered
a
number
of
technicalities,
and
therefore
because
this
is
simply
a
branch
of
that
broader
law
and
really
no
different
from
that
broader
law,
and
because
it's
so
carefully,
it's
so
closely
bound
up
in
when
a
judge
will
permit
a
plaintiff
to...
a
defendant
to
assert
a
certain
kind
of
claim,
it's
like
court
administration.
it's
like...
i'm
trying
to
get
you
to
focus
on
what
i
think
is
the
characterization
of
it
that
would
help
him,
so
that
you
can
reply
to
that.
unknown
speaker
suppose,
suppose
the
secretary
decided
that
this
just
makes
the
administration
of
plans
impossible,
that
every
plan
administrator
has
to
figure
out
what
the
law
is
in
50
different
states
and
go
through
the
same
job
of
determining
whether
it
is
narrowly
applied
to
insurance
or
it's
a
general
law
and
so
forth,
and
he
says:
we're
going
to
adopt
a
rule
that'll
apply
to
all.
can
the
secretary
do
that,
to
all
plans?
unknown
speaker
yeah.
how
could
it
preempt
the
field
when
you
have
this
express
exemption
for
state
laws
regulating
insurance?
unknown
speaker
of
course,
the
government
doesn't
like
that.
the
government
wants
to
have
it
both
ways.
but
it
seems
to
me
that
if
this
is
indeed
the
regulation
of
insurance
the
secretary
has
no
control
over
it.
unknown
speaker
but
i
mean,
you
know,
that
doesn't
help
your
case
a
whole
lot,
because
that
means
that
there
could
be
all
sorts
of
different
rules
in
different
states
pertaining
to
the
administration
of
insurance
plans,
and
they
would
all
be
applicable.
unknown
speaker
and
it
could
make...
it's
clear
that
congress
wanted
administration
of
these
plans
to
be
simple.
unknown
speaker
are
you
going
to
address
the
elfstrom
rule?
unknown
speaker
i
didn't
know
that
you
were
making
that
particular
argument.
elfstrom...
well,
maybe
you
are.
it's
my
confusion
about
what
the
elfstrom
rule
is.
i
thought
you
said...
didn't
the
ninth
circuit
say
it
didn't
relate
to--
unknown
speaker
--the
ninth
circuit
didn't
say
anything
about
the
savings
clause.
unknown
speaker
but
you
just
said
something
about
savings,
and
that
wasn't--
unknown
speaker
--but
the
council
of
state
governments
did
say
something
about
savings
in
elfstrom,
and
your
brief
doesn't
pick
that
up.
your
brief
just
talks
about
it
doesn't
relate
to.
unknown
speaker
no,
i'm
not
talking
about
the
sg.
i'm
talking
about
the
council
of
state
governments.
they
filed
a
brief
on
your
side.
unknown
speaker
and
they
said
they
think
that
this
is
a
law
that
regulates
insurance
and
therefore
it's
saved.
unknown
speaker
but
you
did
make
the
argument
that
the
ninth
circuit
really
didn't
apply
elfstrom,
which
i
find
very
difficult
to
follow
in
view
of
the
language
of
the
ninth
circuit.
it
said
elfstrom,
elfstrom,
elfstrom.
unknown
speaker
to
see
if
it
had
assumed
the
duties.
unknown
speaker
is
it
your
view
that
if
you
win
on
the
notice
prejudice
rule
we
don't
have
to
fuss
with
the
elfstrom
rule?
unknown
speaker
that's
the
heart
of
your
argument,
if
i
got
the
message.
unknown
speaker
and
that's
a
good
time
to
sit
down.
unknown
speaker
so
the
question
isn't
the
content
of
the
state
law.
it's
what
the
state
law...
how
the
state
law
qualifies
as
a
matter
of
federal
law.
unknown
speaker
which
we
can
re-examine
de
novo.
unknown
speaker
but
that
would...
i
know
you
said
this
is
not
like
mcfadden,
but
there's
lots
of
things
that
regulate
insurance,
like
false
and
deceptive
selling
techniques
and
representations
in
policies,
that
are
in
insurance
codes
of
fair
practices,
and
they
surely
have
common
law
derivation
just
like
here.
so
they
become
not...
they
don't
regulate
the
business
of
insurance
if
they
have
a
strong
common
law
underpinning?
unknown
speaker
well,
now
you're
shifting
to
something
else.
you're
shifting
away
from
the
common
law
derivation.
but
i
was
thinking
all
of
consumer
protection
law
has
some
roots
in
the
common
law.
unknown
speaker
what
you're
saying
is
that
half
of
what's
in
an
insurance
code
doesn't
count
because
it's
derived
from
the
common
law,
but
applied
to,
specifically
to
the
insurance
industry.
unknown
speaker
the
honorable
court
is
now
adjourned
until
monday
next
at
ten
o'clock.
