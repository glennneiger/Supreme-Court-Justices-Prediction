mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i'd
like
to
address
several
things
at
the
outset
in
terms
of
petitioner's
argument
that
the
notice
prejudice
rule
conflicts
with
provisions
of
erisa
itself,
before
i
get
to
the
insurance
savings
clause.
first,
counsel
mentioned
or
argued
that
the
application
of
the
notice
prejudice
rule
would
be
inconsistent
with
the
requirement
that
a
fiduciary
administer
the
plan
in
accordance
with
its
terms.
actually,
what
section
1104(a)(1)(d)
of
title
29
says,
it
should
be
administered
in
accordance
with
the
documents
and
instruments
governing
the
plan
"insofar
as
such
documents
and
instruments
are
consistent
with
the
provisions
of
this
subchapter.
"
this
subchapter
includes
the
insurance
savings
clause.
so
to
the
extent
the
insurance
savings
clause
makes
state
law
applicable
to
the
plan,
the
administrator
is
required
to
comply
with
state
law
in
the
same
way
that
the
administrator
would
obviously
be
required
to
comply
with
federal
law.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
yes,
because
the
statute
itself
says
only
insofar
as
it's
consistent
with
the
subchapter,
which
itself
incorporates
state
law.
the
other
point
that's
been
argued
is
that
section
503
of
erisa,
which
requires
plans
to
have
claims
adjudication
procedures
in
accordance
with
regulations
of
the
secretary,
somehow
occupies
the
field
or
ousts
any
notice...
any
application
of
a
rule
like
the
notice
prejudice
rule.
and
we
think
that
is
also
incorrect.
section
503
says
nothing
about
the
filing
of
claims.
the
secretary's
regulations
under
section
503
say
nothing
about
the
time
period
for
the
initial
filing
of
a
claim.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
we
believe
she
could,
but
section
503
and
certainly
the
regulations
as
they're
now
written
do
not
occupy
the
field.
the
very
first
section
of
the
regulations
say
that
they
establish
minimum
standards
for
claims,
and
that
appears
on
page
105a
of
the
appendix.
the
regulations
establish
minimum
procedures.
they
don't
address
at
all
the
time
period
for
filing
claims.
and
most
significantly,
they
provide
in
three
separate
different
subsections,
(c),
(d)(3),
and
(g)(3),
that
where
the
plan
provides
for
an
insurance
company
to
administer...
to
administer
the
policy,
that
the
claims
process...
excuse
me...
an
insurance
company
that
is
subject
to
regulation
under
state
law,
that
the
claim
may
provide
for
claims
to
be
adjudicated
by
the
insurance
company.
so
the
regulations
themselves
refer
to
the
fact
that
insurance
companies
are
subject
to
state
regulations.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
according
to
the
amicus
brief
filed
by
the
national
association
of
insurance
commissioners,
26
states
have
similar--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--right.
well--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--there
are...
there
are
parallel
principles
of
general
contract
law
that
aren't
precisely
the
same,
but
that
will
relieve
a
party
to
a
contract
of
a
default.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
but
the
important
point,
though,
is
that
from
the
outset...
and
this
is
explained
at
some
length
in
respondent's
brief.
from
the
outset,
this
particular
rule
has
been
explained
and
articulated
and
evolved
in
insurance-specific
terms.
it
is
articulated
in
terms
of
notice
to
the
insurer
and
now
the
insurer
bears
the
burden
of
proof
in
showing
an
absence
of
prejudice,
which
is
an
insurance-specific
burden
of
proof
rule.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
right,
no.
it
has
been
articulated
from
the
outset.
all
the
california
cases,
and
there
is
a
wealth
of
them,
show
that
it
is
an
insurance-specific
rule.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
yes,
we
have
a
court
of
appeals
holding
to
that
effect.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
right,
and
this
court--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--that's
correct,
and
the
district
of
columbia
circuit
also
interpreted
specifically
the
california
notice
prejudice
rule
as
being
an
insurance-specific
rule.
this
court
does
normally
defer
to
a
court
of
appeals
rule
or
interpretation
of
state
law.
it's
also
quite
clear
that
a
state
common
law
rule
can
regulate.
that's
been
clear
in
this
court's
preemption
cases
and
other
areas...
garman,
medtronic,
tripalone,
cases
like
that...
the
court
has
made
clear
that
state
common
law
rules
may
regulate.
and
also,
just
one
further
point
on
justice
breyer's
question.
if
a
state
passed
an
insurance-specific
statute
that
had
a
rule
applicable
to
insurance
and
there
was
also
another
statute
of
the
state
applicable
to
banking
that
had
a
similar
rule,
i
don't
think
that
the
law
would
be
rendered
not
an
insurance
law
since
it
regulates
the
terms
of
an
insurance
contract.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
we
believe
that
that's
a
general
agency
principle,
and
in
fact
the
respondent
doesn't
try
to
defend
it
on
any
other
ground,
nor
did
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
yes,
i
would
like
to
address
that.
in
this
court's
decision
in
metropolitan
life,
the
court
really
went
through
a
two-step
analysis.
the
first
and
i
think
primary
focus
should
be
on
whether
the
law
is
one
regulating
insurance
within
a
commonsense
or
straightforward
meaning
of
that
term.
and
in
metropolitan
life
the
court
held
that
a
mandated
benefits
provision
to
be
included
in
the
contract
of
insurance
regulates
insurance
within
a
commonsense
understanding
of
that
term,
and
specifically
focused
on
the
fact
that
"contract
of
insurance"
is
one
of
the
phrases
mentioned
in
the
deemer
clause
and
that
that
was
the
sort
of
thing
intended
to
be
saved
to
the
states
under
the
insurance
savings
clause.
the
notice
prejudice
rule
is
directly
parallel
to
that.
you
could
look
at
it
either
as
a
mandatory
term
in
a
contract,
in
effect,
that
untimeliness
will
not
be
a
ground
for
rejecting
the
claim
unless
there
is
prejudice,
or
that
it
effectively
renders
unenforceable
a
provision
in
a
contract
that
has
a
time
limit
unless
prejudice
is
shown.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
but
we
do
not
believe
that
that
is
essential.
and
even
where
the
pireno
factors
apply
under
the
mccarran-ferguson
act
directly,
the
court
has
said
that
no
one
factor
is
dispositive.
we
don't
think,
particularly
since
the
phrasing
of
the
insurance
savings
clause
seems
to
us
to
be
broader...
it
talks
about
laws
regulating
insurance,
not
regulating
the
business
of
insurance...
that
those
factors
have
to
be
applied
literally.
i
think
it's
important
to
look
at
the
court's
decision
in
fmc
versus
holliday,
where
the
court
held
that
a
state
law,
anti-subrogation
law,
regulates
insurance
within
the
meaning
of
the
insurance
savings
clause,
and
that
certainly
did
not
allocate
the
risk,
the
initial
risk
for
the
injury
or
the
occurrence.
what
it
did
was
simply
say
that
if
the
insured
recovers
on
a
policy
against
the
wrongdoer
that
there
is
no
recovery
from
the
insurance
company
on
that.
so
we
think
the
commonsense
view
of
it
is
that,
at
least
if
the
issue
concerns
something
that
is
in
the
contract
of
insurance...
and
this
court
said
in
metropolitan
life,
referring
to
the
national
securities
case,
that
the
relationship
between
the
insured
and
the
insurer,
the
contract
of
insurance
and
its
enforcement,
are
at
the
very
core
of
what
congress
intended
to
save
to
the
states
under
the
insurance...
excuse
me,
under
mccarran-ferguson.
we
think
the
contract
of
insurance
and
the
relationship
between
the
insured
and
the
insurer
is
at
the
core
here
as
well
of
what
congress
intended
to
save
to
the
states.
there's
no
question
that
the
notice
prejudice
rule
goes
to
the
relationship
between
the
insured
and
the
insurer
and
goes
to
the
enforceability,
one
of
the
important
things
saved
to
the
states,
of
the
contract
provision
that
is
included
within,
either
included
within
the
contract
or
is
rendered
unenforceable
in
the
absence
of
a
showing
of
prejudice.
i
would
like
to...
on
the
elfstrom
rule,
the
second
point
of
the
case,
we
do
believe
that
the
elfstrom
rule
very
clearly
does
relate
to
an
erisa
plan.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
the
ninth
circuit
seemed
to
treat
it
more
as
a
factual
question
under
general
agency
law,
and
that's
why
we
believe
it
is
not...
that
it
is
not
saved.
but
we
do
believe
that
it
could
be
applied
as
a
matter
of
federal
common
law.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
i
actually
think
it's
a
combination
of
the
two,
because
it
depends
on
the
predicate
fact
that
the
employer
has
actually
assumed
some
responsibilities
for
administering
the
contract.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
the
ninth
circuit
did
not
say
that
it
was--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--for
these
purposes,
we
don't
think
it
matters
whether
it's
law
or
fact.
it
is
a
rule
of
general
applicability
and
not
focused
on
the
insurance
contract.
