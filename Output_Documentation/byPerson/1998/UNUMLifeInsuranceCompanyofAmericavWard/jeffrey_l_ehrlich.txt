mr.
jeffrey
l.
ehrlich
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
think
the
place
to
start
is
back
with
the
savings
clause
in
erisa,
where
congress
said
that
any
law
of
any
state
that
regulates
insurance
would
be
saved
from
preemption.
as
i
hear
unum's
argument,
they
are
trying
to
define
or
add
conditions
to
this
by
redefining
the
notice
prejudice
rule
or
the
savings
clause
to
exclude
a
rule
that
they
characterize
as
administrative.
but
in
our
view
the
notice
prejudice
rule
can't
be
accurately
described
as
administrative,
because
it
changes
a
condition
precedent
for
coverage
under
the
policy.
the
policy
said
that
mr.
ward
had
to
make
a
claim
within
a
particular
period
of
time
and
if
he
didn't
do
so
unum
wouldn't
have
to
pay.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
ehrlich
justice
souter,
i
believe
it
is
fair
because
in
its
effect
it
determines
whether
or
not
the
coverage
is
available
to
the
claimant
in
this
situation,
and
the
state
has
changed
it.
unum
admits
that
the
notice
prejudice
rule
alters
the
terms
of
its
policy,
and
in
fact
it's
that
alteration
that
forms
the
entire
basis
of
its
claim
that
there's
a
conflict
with
section
502.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
ehrlich
well,
there's
no
doubt
that
mr.
ward--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
ehrlich
--no,
i
wouldn't
say
that's
a
coverage
provision.
but
here
unum
has
treated
the
claims
provision
or
the
requirement
in
its
policy
that
if
you
don't
meet
it
we
don't
have
to
pay
your
claim.
so
that
goes
directly
to
whether
coverage
exists
for
mr.
ward,
and
california
has
said
that
that
kind
of--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
ehrlich
--i
don't
know
that...
the
word
"coverage"
is
not
what
congress
put
in
the
savings
clause.
it
says
"any
law
that
regulates
insurance".
so
even
if
the
notice
prejudice
rule
is
seen
as
a
rule
that
somehow
only
applies
to
the
administration
of
the
policy,
i'm
not
sure
that
that
suddenly
automatically
means
that
it's
not
within
the
scope
of
the
savings
clause.
i
have
a
great
difficulty,
i
think
unum
has
great
difficulty,
or
would
have
difficulty,
in
trying
to
square
its
argument
with
the
court's
holding
in
fmc,
where
the
court
said
that
the
anti-subrogation
law,
which
doesn't
affect
the
coverage
of
the
policy...
the
insurer
still
has
to
pay,
but
may
be
entitled
after
the
fact
to
recover
what
it
paid
from
the
insurer...
the
insured,
if
the
insured
can
recover
it
from
a
third
party.
and
pennsylvania
passed
a
law
saying
you
can't
have
that
kind
of
term.
and
the
court
said
that
that
law
invalidated
the
subrogation
provisions
and
therefore
it
controlled
the
terms
of
the
insurance
policy
and
therefore
it
was
a
law
that
regulated
insurance.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
ehrlich
the
insurance...
the
risk
to
the
insured
is
the
same,
justice
scalia.
the
person
is
injured,
the
person
goes
to
the
insurance
company,
and
the
insurance
company
pays
the
claim.
after
the
fact,
if
there
is
some
other
pocket
that
the
injured
person
can
recover
from,
then
the
insurance
company
may
stand
to
be
reimbursed.
but
it
doesn't
change--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
ehrlich
--my
understanding
is
that
the
risk,
the
transfer
of
risk,
goes
to
what
the
insured
must
no
longer
be
responsible
for.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
ehrlich
i
think
that's
right,
and
in
the
fabe
decision
the
court's
position
was
that
a
statute,
an
ohio
preference
for
insureds
who
have
the
misfortune
of
having
their
insurance
company
go
into
receivership,
was
sufficiently
addressed
to
the
spreading
of
risk
because
it
assured
that
the
policy
would
be
performed
in
circumstances
where
it
otherwise
might
not
be
performed.
and
that's
really,
the
notice
prejudice
rule
can
be
described
in
the
same
way.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
ehrlich
i
want
to
be
very
careful
in
responding
to
your
question,
justice
breyer,
not
getting
hung
up
in
"as
such",
because
the
notice
prejudice
rule
is
not
just
a
branch
or
an
application
of
a
broadly
applied
principle.
california
courts
have
applied
it
only
in
the
insurance
context.
and
if
you
are
a
party
to
any
kind
of
other
contract
in
california,
a
mortgage,
a
lease,
any
other
kind
of
contract,
and
you
miss
a
notice
deadline
in
the
policy,
you
have
no
assurance.
you
cannot
come
into
court
in
california
and
say,
oh,
there's
a
rule
that
means
i
don't
have
to
comply
with
this
notice
unless
the
other
party
who
s
trying
to
enforce
it
can
bear
the
burden
of
showing
substantial
prejudice.
that
rule,
that
kind
of
categorical
application,
only
applies
in
california
to
insurance
policies,
and
that's
why
it's
not
accurate
to
say,
well,
this
is
really
just
restatement
section
229.
in
all
of
the
other
contexts,
if
a
party
is
trying
to
assert
that
principle
that
there's
a
disproportionate...
forfeiture
would
be
disproportionate
or
apply
restatement
section
229,
you'd
have
to
come
before
the
court
in
a
case
by
case
basis,
invoke
the
court's
discretion
or
equity
that
in
the
terms
of
that
particular
contract
the
equities
are
with
you,
that
it's
not
a
material
term
of
the
contract,
and
you
would
be
the
person
that
would
have
to
bear
the
burden.
but
here
california
by
rule
has
categorically
changed
it
and
the
rule
only
applies
in
insurance
policies.
and
although
unum
has
cases
where
the
words
"notice"
and
the
words
"prejudice"
appear
fairly
close
to
each
other,
there's
no
notice
prejudice
rule.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
ehrlich
so
as
i
understand
your
question,
would
it
be
valid
if
the
secretary
under
its
authority
under
section
503
adopted
a
rule,
and
would
that
preempt
the
field?
mr.
jeffrey
l.
ehrlich
that
would...
i
think
that's
correct.
i
think
that
the
secretary's
power
to
promulgate
regulations--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
ehrlich
--the
secretary's
power
is
obviously
delimited
by
the
terms
of
what
congress
gave
the
secretary
in
erisa
and
what
congress...
part
of
what
the
secretary
has
to
work
with
is
the
fact
that
laws
that
regulate
insurance
are
saved.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
ehrlich
well--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
ehrlich
--i
suppose
that
when
the
rule...
there
are
rules
of
administration
and
rules
that
go
directly
to
whether
the
claim's
going
to
be
paid.
it
seems
to
me
that
here
this
rule
is
really
no
different
than
the
rules
that
the
court
has
already
found
regulate
insurance,
such
as
the
anti-subrogation
statute.
and
in
the
national
securities
case,
when
the
court
defined
for
the
purposes
of
the
mccarran-ferguson
act
what
the
scope
of
the
business
of
insurance
was,
the
court
said
that
if
it's
a
rule
that
addresses
the
relationship
between
the
insurance
company
and
its
insured
or
if
it
goes
to
the
type
of
contract
that
can
be
issued,
its
reliability,
its
enforcement,
or
its
interpretation,
that's
within
the
scope
of
the
business
of
insurance.
it
seems
that
the
court
should
apply
the
same,
or
that
congress
would
no
doubt...
that
was
said
before
erisa
was
enacted...
and
when
congress
put
a
savings
clause
in
that
let
states
regulate
insurance,
that
it
must
have
known
that
that
might
create
some
disuniformities.
and
the
court
has
recognized
that
in
metropolitan
life.
i
don't
see
any
conflict
here
between
the
ability
to
change
the
terms
of
the
contract
under
the
savings
clause
and
then
the
power
to
enforce
the
contract
once
it's
been
changed
or
permissibly
altered.
that
argument,
which
unum
makes,
would
completely
swallow
up
metropolitan
life
and
the
fmc
versus
holliday
case,
where
in
neither
of
those
cases
did
the
insurance...
well,
in
one
case,
in
metropolitan
life,
the
policy
did
not
contain
the
mandated
benefit
provision.
and
in
fmc,
the
policy
contained
a
provision
that
was
unenforceable.
and
in
both
cases,
if
it's
saved
it
would
be
enforced.
under
unum's
approach,
the
savings
clause
would
just
disappear
because
any
time
the
state
exercised
the
power
that
congress
gave
it
to
regulate
insurance
and
changed
or
altered
the
terms
of
the
policy,
then
there
would
be
a
conflict
and
it
would
not
be
enforceable.
so
i
don't
see
any
conflict
with
502,
and
obviously
the
government
doesn't
see
any,
either.
i
guess
i
would
part
also
company
with
unum's
attempt
to
rely
on
this
three-part
pireno
factor
that
the
court
developed
in
a
different
context,
which
was
to
decide
whether
the
state
law...
i'm
sorry,
whether
a
particular
business
practice
regulates
the
business
of
insurance.
unum
has
changed
the
test
and
substitutes
the
word
unum's
formulation
would
be:
does
this
law
constitute
the
business
of
insurance?
and
that's
not
the
test
under
erisa.
the
test
is
whether
it's
a
state
law
that
regulates
insurance.
and
as
the
court
in
fabe
recognized,
the
category
of
laws
that
regulate
the
business
of
insurance
is
necessarily
broader
than
simply
the
business
of
insurance,
and
unum
is
confusing
its
tests
here.
so
in
our
view,
where
the
state
has
changed
the
terms
of
the
insurance
policy,
as
it
did
in
fmc,
as
it
did
in
metropolitan
life,
and
the
court
held
that
common
sense
dictated
it
was
regulating
insurance,
the
same
rule
is
applicable
here.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
ehrlich
i
have
very
little
to
add
to
the
elfstrom
rule
than
what
we've
already
said
in
the
briefs,
and
so
i
would
ask
the
court
to
simply
resolve
the
case
by
reaffirming
what
it
said
in
metropolitan
life,
which
is
if
a
state
law
regulates
insurance
it's
saved,
and
that
the
court
will
not
read
limitations--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
ehrlich
--that's
right,
that
was
the
ninth
circuit's
view.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
ehrlich
no,
your
honor.
i
apologize.
i
didn't
mean
to
indicate
at
all
that
i
said
that
the
elfstrom
rule
or
the
general
agency
principles
that
the
ninth
circuit
applied
were
saved.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
ehrlich
i
was
trying
to
wind
up
and
sit
down,
your
honor.
[laughter]
mr.
jeffrey
l.
ehrlich
i
don't...
i
didn't
understand
the
government's
position
to
be
that
the
elfstrom
rule
was
a
rule
that
regulated
insurance.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
ehrlich
yes.
yes,
they
did.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
ehrlich
justice
ginsburg,
we
didn't
make
that
argument
because
we
were
troubled
by
the
fact
that
what
the
ninth
circuit
appeared
to
apply
were
generally
applicable
rules,
and
so
it
looked
to
us
maybe
too
much
like
the
situation
in
pilot
life,
where
the
court
said
that
a
rule
that
was
generally
applicable
in
all
cases
wouldn't
be
specifically
directed
at
insurance.
so
we
didn't
make
that
argument.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
ehrlich
it
was
difficult,
your
honor.
but
in
our
view,
as
i
read
the
california
supreme
court's
decision
in
elfstrom,
the
court
established
that
if
the
employer
assumed
these
administrative
duties
then
as
a
matter
of
law
it
was
the
agent.
the
ninth
circuit
remanded
for
a
factual
finding.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
ehrlich
well,
another
clue
to
what
we
view
as
the
way
the
ninth
circuit
read
the
elfstrom
rule
was
the
discussion
of
the
oregon
case
where
the
ninth
circuit
sort
of
harmonizes
elfstrom
and
all
other
rules
that
are...
might
initially
seem
at
odds
with
each
other,
and
comes
out
saying
that
elfstrom
is
one
end
of
a
continuum
and
there
are
other
cases
on
the
other
end
of
the
continuum.
and
actually
we
read
elfstrom
to
require
no
more...
i'm
not
saying
it
right
because
i
hadn't
focused
on
this.
but
the
ninth
circuit
reformulated
the
elfstrom
rule
so
that
it
was
no
longer
a
categorical
rule
where
you
simply
said,
well,
if
the
employer
is
the
administrator
then
it's
the
agent,
and
instead
it
said
we
look
to
the
facts
of
the
matter
on
a
case
by
case
basis.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
ehrlich
that
is
our
view.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
ehrlich
that
is
the
heart
of
our
argument,
yes.
and
with
that--
