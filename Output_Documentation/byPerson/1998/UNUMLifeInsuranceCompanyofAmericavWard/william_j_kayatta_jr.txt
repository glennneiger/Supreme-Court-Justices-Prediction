mr.
william
j.
kayatta,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court:
this
is
an
action
for
plan
benefits
under
erisa.
now,
the
plan
in
question
in
this
case
is
an
insurance
policy.
it
is
not
a
self-funded
plan.
citing
this
fact,
the
ninth
circuit
has
determined
that
certain
claim
administration
rules
in
this
erisa
plan
cannot
be
enforced
in
this
federal
action
because
california
courts
would
not
enforce
those
same
claim
administration
rules
under
common
law
principles
that
are
regularly
applied
by
california
courts
in
breach
of
insurance
contract
cases.
there
are
two
basic
flaws
to
this
holding.
first,
the
ninth
circuit
has
disregarded
congress'
intent
to
create
uniform
exclusively
federal
rules
for
claims
administration
and
enforcement
without
reference
to
varying
state
laws,
even
state
laws
that
regulate
insurance.
second
and
independently,
the
ninth
circuit
has
misapplied
erisa's
statutory
preemption
clause
by
determining
that
california's
notice
prejudice
rule
is
a
rule
that
regulated
insurance
and
by
determining
that
a
rule
of
california
common
law
that
precludes
a
plan
administrator
from
doing
what
congress
says
the
administrator
can
do
does
not
relate
to
an
employee
benefit
plan.
mr.
william
j.
kayatta,
jr.
we
agree
there
is
a
savings
clause.
we
do
not
agree
that
any
law
that
satisfies
mccarran-ferguson
is
automatically
saved.
you
could
have
a
law
that
satisfies
the
definition
of
business
of
insurance
that
this
court
could
determine
is
not
a
law
which
regulates
insurance.
secondly
and
more
importantly,
this
court
has
held
in
pilot
life,
reaffirmed
it
in
taylor,
and
then
again
in
john
hancock,
that
even
laws
that
are
otherwise
saved
under
the
savings
clause
are
preempted
if
they
stand
as
an
obstacle
to
one
of
congress'
purposes
in
enacting
erisa
or
in
a
specific
provision.
mr.
william
j.
kayatta,
jr.
erisa
made
a
number
of
balances.
one
of
its
primary
purposes
was
to
make
employers
more
likely
to
have
these
plans
to
benefit
workers.
that
is
the
major
benefit
that
erisa
produces
for
employees,
and
it
has
been
fabulously
successful,
in
large
part
because
of
what
this
court
did
in
pilot
life.
now,
having
said
that,
i
agree
with
you
that
an
amorphous
purpose
of
erisa
without
some
clear
foundation
in
the
record
is
not
enough
to
preempt
a
law
that
would
otherwise
be
saved.
mr.
william
j.
kayatta,
jr.
we
agree
with
that,
your
honor,
and
we're
not
saying
that
you
can
do
away
with
the
savings
clause.
the
savings
clause...
we
also
agree
that
the
analysis
starts
with
the
presumption
that
state
law
is
saved.
however,
the
second
stage
of
the
analysis
then
says,
is
this
within
the
savings
clause?
and
the
third
stage,
and
this
is
the
stage
we're
talking
about
now,
says
even
if
it
is
within
the
savings
clause
it
will
not
stand,
it
will
be
preempted,
in
certain
circumstances.
and
the
most
important
circumstance
is
the
one
identified
by
this
court
in
pilot
life
and
reaffirmed
in
taylor
and
hancock,
which
is
when
you
go
to
the
heart
of
erisa's...
congress
did
not
do
many
things
in
erisa.
it
left
the
substantive
benefits
of
plans,
particularly
welfare
plans,
totally
alone
and
silent.
but
what
it
directed
its
attention
to
was
erecting
a
comprehensive,
uniform
federal
civil
enforcement
scheme
modeled
after
section
301
of
the
lmra.
and
you
cannot...
this
court
has
held
that
that
purpose
is
not
to
be
frustrated.
mr.
william
j.
kayatta,
jr.
that
would...
that
would
eliminate
one
of
the
problems
with
what
the
ninth
circuit
has
done.
mr.
william
j.
kayatta,
jr.
yes,
because
now
you
would
be
doing
what
congress
said
for
the
courts
to
do
and
what
you
told
the
courts
to
do,
which
is
in
a
502(a)
action
apply
the
statute
and
as
necessary
develop
a
uniform
body
of
federal
common
law.
so
if
you're
now
saying,
okay,
we're
not
going
to
have
a
federal
court's
decision
in
an
erisa
action
as
to
how
to
interpret
a
plan
mandated
by
a
state
common
law,
we're
going
to
develop
federal
common
law,
then
the
court
would
confront
several
other
questions.
one
would
be
are
we
going
to
develop
a
common
law
that
conflicts
with
any
other
substantive
provisions
of
erisa,
and
there
are
two
in
particular
which
the
court
would
need
to
pay
attention
to.
one
is
that
which
was
identified
by
this
court
as
one
of
the
core
aspects
of
erisa,
which
is
the
role
that
the
written
plan
instrument
plays
under
erisa.
so
the
federal
court
would
need
to
say,
before
we
go
and
say
that
the
plan
fiduciary
must
not,
as
congress
ordered
him,
act
in
accordance
with
a
written
plan
instrument,
we
need
to
satisfy
that
there
is
some
other
federal
interest
here
that
would
overbear
that,
such
as
for
example
if
you
had
a
facial
illegality
of
a
policy
that
might
be
a
circumstance.
the
key
point
is,
though,
that
the
analysis
would
be
one
of
federal
law
and
the
federal
courts
can
look
to
state
law,
the
restatement
states
courts
law
around
the
country,
to
inform
itself
as
to
what
the
common
law
might
be
on
a
uniform
federal
basis.
mr.
william
j.
kayatta,
jr.
i
do
not
believe
the
three
words
"written
plan
instrument"
appear
in
a
row.
however,
what
it
says
is
"written
plan
document".
mr.
william
j.
kayatta,
jr.
and
we're
now
addressing,
if
i
understand
your
question
correctly,
not
to
301,
502
field
preemption
that
we
talked
about
in
the
beginning.
mr.
william
j.
kayatta,
jr.
now
we're
on
to
the
written
plan.
mr.
william
j.
kayatta,
jr.
and
i
think
this
court
in
curtiss
wright
captured
it
this
way,
that
reliance
on
the
face
of
the
written
plan
document...
those
were
this
court's
words...
is
one
of
erisa's
core
functional
requirements.
mr.
william
j.
kayatta,
jr.
yes,
it
is.
and
erisa
section
404(a)(1)(d)
specifically
in
congress'
words
requires
that
the
fiduciary
act
in
accord
with
the
plan
documents.
mr.
william
j.
kayatta,
jr.
the
example
you
pose
has
not
just
the
preemption
problem,
but,
because
you
pick
notice
prejudice,
it
runs
head-on
into
some
other
provisions
of
erisa.
if
i
understand
the
thrust
of
the
question,
i
think
it
is
a
state
says
you
must
have
this
provision
in
your
policy
and
an
insurance
company
doesn't
do
it
and
then
says:
aha,
we
don't
have
it
in
our
policy,
the
state
law
is
preempted,
and
so
we
get
by
with
this.
if
that's
the
question--
mr.
william
j.
kayatta,
jr.
--yes.
well
then,
let
me
address
this
very
specific
one.
mr.
william
j.
kayatta,
jr.
i
do
not
think
that
a
state
could
do
that
with
the
specific
one,
because
in
that
situation,
even
though
you
would
have
a
facial
illegality
of
the
policy
if
the
underlying
rule
were
saved,
such
as
for
example
the
rule
in
metropolitan-massachusetts,
but
here
the
underlying
rule
is
a
dictate
to
federal
courts
as
to
how
they
must
enforce
or
interpret
language
in
the
plan,
and
that--
mr.
william
j.
kayatta,
jr.
--all
right,
if
the
state
law
says
you
have
to
have
this
notice
provision
in
your
contract
and
the
policy
does
not--
mr.
william
j.
kayatta,
jr.
--well,
then,
then
if
the
state
law
doesn't
say
that
it's
improper
to
have
a
contract
without
this
language,
it
simply
says
that
whatever
your
language
we're
going
to
deem
it
to
be
this--
mr.
william
j.
kayatta,
jr.
--well,
then
the
policy
would
not
comply
with
the
mandatory
state
insurance
statute.
in
that
situation
you
would
have
a
facial
illegality
on
the
policy.
the
question
with
notice
prejudice,
however,
would
still
remain
can
a
state
dictate
the
claims
administration
procedures
under
erisa,
which
is--
mr.
william
j.
kayatta,
jr.
--that
is
what
the
california
rule
essentially
says.
mr.
william
j.
kayatta,
jr.
in
effect,
that's
what
the
california
common
law
rule
does.
but
the
rule
does
not
say
that
no
policy
can
be
issued
that
provides
otherwise.
mr.
william
j.
kayatta,
jr.
well,
the
answer
would...
the
answer
to
this
particular
question,
we
would
get
over
one
hump.
we
would
have
a
facially
illegal
policy
if
it
did.
mr.
william
j.
kayatta,
jr.
that's
right.
mr.
william
j.
kayatta,
jr.
in
that...
we're
not
conceding
that,
because
in
that
circumstance
what
california
would
be
doing
is
directing
its
attention
not
to
the
502
issue,
but
to
the
other
provisions
in
erisa
which
say
and
delegate
to
the
secretary
the
authority
to
promulgate
regulations
on
claims
administration
matters.
that
would
be
the
problem
with
a
statute
that
said
this,
is
it
would
be
california
saying,
no
matter
what
the
secretary
says
is
a
reasonable
claims
procedure--
mr.
william
j.
kayatta,
jr.
--so
i'm
off
to
a
different
argument
here,
which
is
why
that
statute
would
not
work.
that
statute...
and
that's
why--
mr.
william
j.
kayatta,
jr.
--well,
i'm
saying
two
things,
yes,
and
perhaps
you're
saying
it
better
than
i
am.
mr.
william
j.
kayatta,
jr.
i
think
how
the
state
does
it
does
make
a
difference,
and
i
can
come
back
to
it
if
you
like.
but
yes,
in
either
situation
it
would
not
be
the
state
purporting
to
do
something
substantive
that
congress
has
not
directed
its
attention
to.
mr.
william
j.
kayatta,
jr.
well,
practically
it
certainly
could
because
any
state
bar
of
that
sort
insurance
companies
will
comply
with.
mr.
william
j.
kayatta,
jr.
and
as
a
legal
matter,
i
do
not
think
a
court
can
dictate...
a
state
can
dictate
the
claims
administration
procedures
under
an
erisa
plan.
we
don't
get
to
that
question.
mr.
william
j.
kayatta,
jr.
in
an
erisa
plan,
as
a
matter
of
imposing
state
law,
that's
correct.
mr.
william
j.
kayatta,
jr.
no,
it's
not,
justice
stevens.
mr.
william
j.
kayatta,
jr.
it
is
not
irrelevant
because
the
fact
that
it
was
a
common
law
rule
i
think
means
that
this
isn't
even
that
case.
mr.
william
j.
kayatta,
jr.
yes.
mr.
william
j.
kayatta,
jr.
yes,
we
would
get
to
the
same
result,
for
a
different
reason,
for
a
reason
that
is
also
applicable
here.
but
we
would
lose
one
of
the
other
reasons
that
is
applicable
here,
that
being
our
argument
that
a
common
law
rule
of
this
type
does
not
regulate
insurance.
mr.
william
j.
kayatta,
jr.
erisa
defines
the
term
"laws"
to
include
all
laws
on
that
point.
but
the
issue
here
is
under
the
savings
clause
is
this
a
law
that
regulates
insurance.
so
that
poses
the
question,
what
did
congress
mean
when
it
says
a
law
which
regulates.
mr.
william
j.
kayatta,
jr.
well,
i
don't
quite
see
the
analogy,
because
the
issue
here
is,
given
that
congress
said
a
law
which
regulates
insurance,
did
it
have
in
mind
common
laws
of
this
type,
particularly--
mr.
william
j.
kayatta,
jr.
--that's
correct.
mr.
william
j.
kayatta,
jr.
that's
correct.
mr.
william
j.
kayatta,
jr.
that's
correct.
mr.
william
j.
kayatta,
jr.
that
is
the
rule.
mr.
william
j.
kayatta,
jr.
well,
by
name
it
only
applies
to
insurance
companies.
mr.
william
j.
kayatta,
jr.
that's
not
what
they've
said.
mr.
william
j.
kayatta,
jr.
exactly.
mr.
william
j.
kayatta,
jr.
yes,
and
the
reason
they
say
vacli,
the
mechanic'
lien
case,
a
notice
to
a
conservatee
case,
a
real
estate
case.
mr.
william
j.
kayatta,
jr.
well,
what's
special
is
because
it
purports
to
dictate
the
enforcement
and
interpretation
of
claims
administration
procedures,
and
that
is
the
one
area
in
particular
that
congress
meant
to
preempt
the
field
entirely
on.
mr.
william
j.
kayatta,
jr.
because
we
are
in
a
502(a)
action
and
congress
said
it
intended
that
those
actions
would
be
exclusively
federal
actions
modeled
on
301.
in
a
301
proceeding
you
would
not
bring
a--
mr.
william
j.
kayatta,
jr.
--if
you're
talking
about
a
rule--
mr.
william
j.
kayatta,
jr.
--that's
correct,
but
the
rationale
that
this
court
adopted
for
finding
that
a
502(a)
action
is
an
exclusive
remedy...
and
the
state
law
might
have
lots
of
remedies
that
would
be
fully
applicable
in
a
state
court;
you
can't
bring
them,
you
can't
pursue
them,
you
can't
get
those
damages
here...
the
rationale
was
congress'
instruction
that
this
be
modeled
after
301.
mr.
william
j.
kayatta,
jr.
in
metropolitan
life
the
court
enforced
an
injunction
against
metropolitan
violating
a
state
law
that
required
that
certain
benefits
with
respect
to
which
erisa
was
silent
be
included
in
policies.
here
we
have
a
502(a)
action
which
is
an
exclusive
remedy.
now,
let
me
address
the
point
that,
okay,
is
this
not
a
remedy?
it's
the
same
remedy;
why
can't
we
have
a
different
rule
subsidiary
in
the
pursuit
of
that
remedy?
well,
if
you
say
that,
then
you
have
rejected
the
rationale
for
having
the
exclusive
remedy
in
the
first
place,
was
that
plan
administrators
and
courts
would
be
able
to
determine
the
legality
of
their
actions
without
looking
to
varying
state
law
modeling
it
after
301.
and
you
could
not
in
a
301
action
say,
oh,
this
isn't
the
remedy,
so
we're
going
to
import
common
law.
the
allis-chalmers
case--
mr.
william
j.
kayatta,
jr.
--well,
you
would
first
need
to
do
a
choice
of
law
analysis.
then
you
would
need
to
not
only
determine
what
the
state
common
law
is,
but
then
you
would
need
to
perform
the
type
of
analysis
in
every
instance
of
what
is
the
source
of
this
state
law
and
is
it
different
enough
from
general
law
in
that
particular
state.
so
literally
you
could
have
one
state
which
has
a
notice
prejudice
rule
which
simply
says,
as
in
all
contracts,
we
will
not
enforce
these
provisions,
and
in
another
state
you
say
we
only
do
it
if
you
trace
it
back
50
years
and
you
see
it
exclusively.
this
would
be
a
significant
burden.
mr.
william
j.
kayatta,
jr.
that's
correct,
that's
correct.
mr.
william
j.
kayatta,
jr.
if
you
say
that
congress
meant
that
we
would
have
301
here,
but
with
a
savings
clause,
that's
the
equivalent
of
saying
we
don't
have
301,
because
everything
in
erisa--
mr.
william
j.
kayatta,
jr.
--yes,
everything
in
erisa
preempts
but
for
that
savings
clause
anyhow.
why,
then,
does
502,
as
this
court
found
and
as
congress
intended,
have
a
special
preemptive
force
by
reference
to
301?
it
is
because
301
occupies
the
field
of
enforcement
and
administration,
and
in
fact
was
the
reason
this
court
cited
in
taylor
for
taking
the
extraordinary
step
of
not
enforcing
the
well-pleaded
complaint.
mr.
william
j.
kayatta,
jr.
congress
specifically
said
that
it
intended
502(a)--
mr.
william
j.
kayatta,
jr.
--in
the
committee,
the
committee
report.
mr.
william
j.
kayatta,
jr.
well,
that's
what
this
court
said
in
pilot
life
as
well.
it
specifically
referenced
that
and
came
to
the
conclusion
of
that,
and
then
in
taylor
expanded
upon
it.
if
i
might,
i
would
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time.
mr.
william
j.
kayatta,
jr.
thank
you,
your
honor.
subrogation,
an
anti-subrogation
rule,
is
classic
risk-spreading.
it
says
who
has
the
primary
risk,
who
has
the
secondary
risk.
it
says
as
between
the
insurer,
the
insured,
a
tortfeasor,
and
another
insurance
company,
who
will
have
the
primary
risk-bearing
when
it
comes
to
the
loss.
deferring...
the
court
does
defer
to
considered
decisions,
particularly
repeated
ones
as
in
bishop
and
runyon,
of
the
circuit
courts
regarding
state
law.
but
it
is
something
different
to
defer
to
the
federal
legal
conclusion
given
to
that
state
law.
here
the
issue
is
under
federal
law
is
the
california
law,
whatever
it
might
be,
sufficiently
specific
or
sufficiently
general
to
fall
on
the
applicable
side
of
the
line,
and
i
don't
think
that
that's
something--
mr.
william
j.
kayatta,
jr.
--that's
correct.
mr.
william
j.
kayatta,
jr.
that's
correct.
and
then
secondly,
i
think
we
have
to
be
very
careful
about
simply
adopting
a
provision
that
says
essentially
everything
that's
in
the
restatement
of
contracts
or
trusts,
as
long
as
it
is
given
an
insurance-specific
name
and
applied
and
adopted
repeatedly
in
insurance
cases,
where
it
will
be
applied
the
same
each
time
because
insurance
policies
by
state
law
often
have
the
exact
same
language,
so
you
will
get...
and
they
happen
to
be
the
source
of
a
lot
of
litigation...
so
you
will
get
lots
of
these
cases
having
the
same
name.
and
that
would
cover
essentially
the
entire
restatement
of
contracts.
mr.
william
j.
kayatta,
jr.
i
agree
you
have
to...
there
is
a
spectrum
here
and
we
need
to
draw
a
line
someplace.
i
think
when
we're
talking
about
something
that
is
a
classic,
it's
in
the
restatement
of
contracts
and
it's
simply
applied
here
and
it
varies
from
state
to
state
the
label
being
given
to
it,
how
administrators
are
then
to
apply
that
creates
such
a
burden
on
administrators
where
they
were
supposed
to
not
have
to
refer
to
state
law,
much
less
try
to
determine
is
the
label
dispositive.
mr.
william
j.
kayatta,
jr.
that
would
then
lead
us,
if
we
follow
that
to
its
end,
that
leads
us
to
a
conclusion
that
there
is
no
limit
to
this
definition.
mr.
william
j.
kayatta,
jr.
i'm
saying
that
i
don't
think
the
rule
could
be
at
either
end
of
the
spectrum.
i
don't
think
we
could
have
a
rule
that
says
if
it's
at
all,
in
any
respect
analogous
to
anything
in
the
common
law,
then
it's
not
directed.
conversely,
i
don't
think--
