the
labor
relations
between
federal
agency
and
federal
employee
union
are
governed
and
administered
by
a
special
statute
called
the
federal
service
labor
management
relations
statute
and
a
special
agency
that
is
called
the
federal
labor
relations
authority,
it
is
a
little
bit
like
the
private
sectors
national
labor
relations
act
in
the
nlrb.
now,
this
case
focuses
upon
a
statutory
requirement
in
that
statute
that
i
just
mentioned,
which
says
that
federal
agencies
and
unions
"they
must
meet
and
negotiate
in
good
faith
for
the
purposes
of
arriving
at
a
collective
bargaining
agreement".
now
everybody
agree,
that
this
language
requires
the
agency
and
the
union
to
negotiate
over
basic
collective
bargaining
contracts,
ordinary
contacts,
for
example,
begin
at
a
certain
time
that
go
on
for
few
years
and
then
end.
but
does
it
also
require
the
agency
to
bargain
with
the
union
midterm
that
is
during
say
that,
three
years
so
period
that
the
regular
contract
is
in
effect?
they
might
want
to
do
that
to
negotiate
about
matters
that
the
regular
contract
did
not
cover.
also,
does
that
language
require
the
agency
to
bargain
at
the
end
of
the
normal
contract's
term
about
whether
or
not
there
will
be
midterm
bargaining?
several
years
ago
the
district
of
columbia
circuit
held
that
the
statute
did
require
midterm
bargaining
but
later
the
fourth
circuit
held
the
opposite.
it
said
that
not
even
the
authority
that
agency
they
couldn't
even
require
a
midterm
bargaining,
because
the
statute
simply
could
not
be
read
to
require
or
to
permit
the
authority
to
require
midterm
bargaining
or
bargaining
about
midterm
bargaining.
this
case
comes
to
us
out
of
the
fourth
circuit.
we
review
its
interpretation
of
the
law
and
we
disagree
with
that
interpretation.
we
hold
that
the
statute
can
be
read
to
impose
a
requirement
to
bargain
midterm
or
to
bargain
about
bargaining
midterm.
but
it
does
not
have
to
be
read
that
way;
rather
it
is
up
to
the
authority
to
decide.
the
statute's
language
is
ambiguous,
it
simply
talks
about
"collective
bargaining"
without
mentioning
midterm
or
endterm
bargaining
and
we
could
find
no
literal
language
or
history
or
basic
purpose
or
other
interpretive
tool
that,
in
our
view,
conclusively
resolve
the
ambiguity
one
way
or
the
other.
that
being
so,
we
conclude
that
congress
intended
the
relevant
administrative
agency,
namely
the
federal
labor
relations
authority;
the
congress
intended
that
agency
to
decide
whether,
when,
how,
or
what
sort
of
midterm
bargaining
should
take
place.
that
authority,
not
a
court,
is
the
appropriate
party,
to
weigh
and
to
consider
the
various
policy
oriented
arguments
that
the
parties
have
advanced
in
this
court.
consequently,
we
send
this
case
back
to
the
authority,
so
that
it
may
exercise
its
power
to
decide
about
midterm
bargaining
without
the
constraint
imposed
by
previous
lower
court
opinion
holding
that
the
statute
itself
conclusively
resolve
the
question
either
one
way
or
the
other.
