mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court--
a
federal
agency
has
a
duty
to
negotiate
with
a
union
for
the
purpose
of
arriving
at
a
collective
bargaining
agreement.
once
such
an
agreement
is
reached,
the
agency
does
not
have
an
ongoing
duty
to
negotiate
over
union
initiated
proposals
for
the
purpose
of
supplementing
that
basic
agreement
during
its
term.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
that's
correct,
we
did
not,
and
the
reason
is,
this
court's
decision
seems
to
have...
seemed
to
have
settled
that
question,
including
the
fort
stewart
schools
decision
and
others
that,
as
a
general
matter
at
least,
the
flra
is
entitled
to
chevron
deference.
is
the
reason
because
the
federal
labor
management
relations
agency
has
more
expertise
on
this
general
subject
than
does
the
government
executive's
establishment
in
general?
that
would
not
be
the
reason.
i
think
the
reason
would
be
that
congress
has
delegated
the
authority
to
the
flra
to
administer
the
act,
to
decide
on
fair
labor
practice
charges,
to
adapt
policies
to
further
the
purposes
of
the
act--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--and
that
is
consistent
with
the
general
way,
the
approach
the
court
takes
in
deciding
whether
an
agency
gets
chevron
deference.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
well,
that
does
become
part
of
it,
but
i
would
just
say
that
it's
first
and
foremost
the
delegation
of
authority
that
leads
to
chevron
deference,
and
expertise
is
a
factor
that
goes
along
with
that.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
that
you
do
not
owe
deference
to
this
decision
because
congress
has
clearly
resolved
this
issue
in
the
text
of
the
act.
unlike
the
national
labor
relations
act--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--that's
correct,
justice
o'connor.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
no,
the
text
being
7114(a)(4).
unlike
the...
which
appears
on
the
white
petition
at
27a.
the...
unlike
the
national
labor
relations--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--the
precise
language
is,
shall
meet,
negotiate
in
good
faith
for
the
purpose
of
arriving
at
a
collective
bargaining
agreement.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
it
is
the
combination
of
arrive
and
collective
bargaining
agreement.
the
ordinary
and
only,
the
established
meaning
of
collective
bargaining
agreement
is
comprehensive
term
agreement.
the
product
of
negotiations
that
occur
midterm
are
amendments,
or
supplements,
or
modifications
to
a
collective
bargaining
agreement.
they
are
not
collective
bargaining
agreements
themselves.
so
if
you
have
a
single
collective
bargaining
agreement,
a
term
agreement,
and
it
is
amended
four
times
during
its
term,
the
product
of
that
is
a
single
collective
bargaining
agreement
consisting
of
the
original
provisions
and
the
amendments.
it
is
not,
as
they
would
suggest,
five
separate
collective
bargaining
agreements.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
it
will.
it
will
end
up
with
either
an
amendment,
a
supplement,
or
a
modification
to
the
collective
bargaining
agreement.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
you
can
call
it
that,
but
that's
not
what's
provided
for
in
7114.
what's...
management
changes
is
provided
for
in
7106,
which
is
in
25...
26a
of
the
white
petition,
in
(b),
which
describes
the
duties
that
managements
have
to
negotiate
not
just
at
the
point
that
it's
arriving
at
a
basic
comprehensive
collective
bargaining
agreement,
but
also
throughout
on
a
continuous
basis,
so
if
management
exercises
management
rights
at
any
point
during
the
course
of
the
agreement,
it
has
a
duty
to
negotiate
by
virtue
of
the
duty
spelled
out
in
7106(b)(2)
and
(3).
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
it--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--that's
correct.
what
i
would--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--that's--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--i
don't
think
you
necessarily
have
to
read
the
negative.
you
just
note
that
there's
no
corresponding
provision
for
union
initiated
changes
which
forces
the
petitioners
to
fall
back
on
7114
itself
to
find
any
obligation.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
but
the
whole
subject
is
about
management
rights,
7106,
and
what
that
is
qualifying
is
the
exercise
of
management
rights,
so
what
that
is
saying
is
that
when
management
exercises
rights,
that
it
does
not
have
to
negotiate
with
respect
to
number
1,
but
it
may,
but
it
does
have
to
negotiate
with
respect
to
the
procedures
which
management
officials
will
observe
in
appropriate
arrangements,
and
i
don't
think
anybody
has
disputed
that
7106(b)(2)
and
(3)
is
exclusively
about
impact
and
implementation
of
bargaining
over
exercises
of
management
rights.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
they--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--they...
we
would
have
to
negotiate
about
that,
yes.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
that's
correct,
as
a
result
of
7106(b)(2)
and
(3).
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
that's
correct.
i
misspoke
if
i
said
more
than
that.
we
have...
we
can
make
the
change,
but
we
have
to
bargain
over
the
procedures
and
the
impact
of
those
changes.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
well,
justice
breyer,
you
state
the
case--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--as
well
as
it
can
be
stated
for
the
other
side,
and--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--but
the
answer
to
that
is--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--that
in
7106,
if
congress
inserted
the
words,
at
the
election
of
the
agency
into
number
1,
in
(b)(1)--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--that's
right,
7106(b)(1),
it
inserted
the
words,
at
the
election
of
the
agency
there,
and
deliberately
did
not
insert
those
same
words
into
(2)
and
(3),
and
the
entire
purpose
of
that
was
to
transform
what
looks
like
a
nothing
precludes
into
something
that
says,
nothing
precludes
(1)
but
(2)
and
(3)
are
required,
and
that
is
the
source
of
the
obligation.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
it
does
not
go
back
to
7114.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
well,
the
answer
is
that
the
term,
collective
bargaining
agreement,
is
not
subject
to
the
kind
of
interpretation
that
you're
suggesting.
collective
bargaining
agreement,
the
established
meaning
of
that
in
the
private
labor
field,
is
comprehensive
term
agreement.
when
this
court
in
its
decisions
refers
to
collective
bargaining
agreements,
it
is
always
referring
to
comprehensive
term
agreements.
when
it
refers
to
the
products
of
midterm
discussions,
it
is
talking
about
supplements
to
the
agreement,
modifications
to
the
agreement,
amendments
to
the
agreement,
and
that
is...
the
flra
does
not
have
authority
to
read
that
term
in
a
different...
other
than
in
its
ordinary
usage.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
no,
justice
stevens.
we're
saying
that
the
only
bargaining
that
takes
place
arises
by
virtue
of
management
making
the
change,
and
then
once
management
makes
the
change
midterm,
the
union
could
request
negotiations,
and
in
fact
management
is
required
when
it
makes
the
change
or
even
before
it
makes
the
change
to
offer
the
union
an
opportunity
to
negotiate
over
impact
of
implementation.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
well,
i
would
say
that
it's
not
initiated
by
the
union
per
se,
because
when
management
makes
the
change
it
must
offer
the
union
an
opportunity
to
negotiate
over--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--well,
that
is
how
(b)(2)
and
(3)
have
been
interpreted
in
light
of
the
very
same
executive
order
experience
that
preexisted
the
act.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
well,
it
is
an
interpretation
of
the
text
of
the
statute.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
well,
not
from
(b)(2)
and
(3),
but
it
is
clear
from...
that
the
duties
in
7114
are
limited
to
negotiation
for
the
purpose
of
arriving
at
a
comprehensive
term
agreement,
and
then
7106(b)(2)
and
(3)
picks
up
only
midterm
bargaining
as
a
result
of
management
changes.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
correct.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
that's
correct.
7106
applies
to
both.
it's
unrestricted.
it's
not
limited
to
either
midterm
or
bargaining
at
the
point
of
reaching
a
comprehensive
term
agreement.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
well,
whatever
rights
exist
under
7106(b)(2)
and
(3)
that
there
are,
whatever
those
rights
are,
and
we
would
say
they
are
limited
to
bargaining
about
impact
and
implementation
of
management
changes,
not
the
substance
of--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--but
those
rights,
yes,
they
apply
midterm
as
well
as
at
the
point
of
the
comprehensive
term
agreement.
the
point
is,
there's
no
corresponding
provision
for
union
initiated
changes
through
proposals
that
have
nothing
to
do
with
management
changes,
or
that
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
impact
and
implementation
of
management
changes,
and
so
unions
must
fall
back
and
the
petitioners
must
fall
back
on
7114,
which
only
creates
a
duty
to
negotiate
for
a
comprehensive
term
agreement.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
yes,
and
that's
the
problem
in
the
case.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
yes,
that's
the
concern.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
justice
stevens,
anything
could
come
up
in
the
term
that
could
come
up--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--well,
in
this
particular
case
we're
fighting
about
inserting
a
provision.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
but
in
other
cases
there's
a
proposal
about
relocation
expenses,
about
working
at
home,
about
parking,
about--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--any
matter
that
could
come
up,
any
matter
that--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--that's
correct.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
that's
correct.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
or
an
amendment,
or
a
modification--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--what
is
before
you
is
not
what
you
just
said.
it's
something
that
completely
duplicates
the
statutory
duty.
your
hypothetical
was
to
open
up
a
particular
matter.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
that's
correct,
and
that
would
present
a
different
question
than
the
question
we
have
in
this
case,
which
concerns
solely
whether
they
can
propose
something
that
replicates
entirely
the
rejected
scheme
of
open
ended
midterm
bargaining.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
what...
that
would
be
precluded
by
7103(14)(c),
which
appears
at
25a
of
the
white
brief
and
that...
what
that
says
is
that
a
proposal
is
not
negotiable
if
it
is
specifically
provided
for
by
a
federal
statute,
and
here
congress
has
specifically
provided
for
the
basic
bargaining
structure,
and
it
has
rejected
open
ended
midterm
bargaining,
so
a
proposal
that
merely
duplicates
that
is
not
a
permissible
subject
of
bargaining.
i
did
want
to--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--well,
on...
7103(12)
is
a
definition.
ultimately
the
duty
that
you
find,
justice
kennedy,
is
in
7114(a)(4),
which
also
talks
about
meeting
at
reasonable
times,
but
it
ties
the
meeting
at
reasonable
times
to
the
overriding
duty,
which
is
to
negotiate
for
the
purpose
of
arriving
at
a
collective
bargaining
agreement.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
so
reasonable
times
would
be
for
the
comprehensive
agreement.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
but
collective
bargaining
means
the
performance
of
the
mutual
obligation,
and
the
mutual
obligation
that
is
referred
to
there,
it
begs
the
question
of
what
is
the
mutual
obligation.
the
mutual
obligation
is
the
obligation,
and
the
only
obligation,
which
appears
in
7114(a)(4).
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
i
think
the
problem
with
a
zipper
clause...
and
what
a
zipper
clause
is
is
a
provision
that
would
say,
the
union
agrees
not
to
negotiate
about
anything
midterm.
the
problem
with
a
zipper
clause
are
several.
first
of
all,
no
one
has
ever
said
that
a
union
must
negotiate
a
zipper
clause
other
than
two
judges
in
that
opinion.
the
flra
has
never
said
that
that
is
something
that
is
mandatory
and,
if
they
have--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--well,
i--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--well,
a
reopener
clause,
like
the
one
that's
in
this--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--a
complete
reopener
clause?
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
that
is
not
a
negotiable
matter,
because
it
is...
that
is
a
matter
that
congress
has
specifically
provided
for
by
a
federal
statute,
and
that
is
that
congress
has
decided
on
the
basic
structure
of
bargaining,
and
it
has
ruled
out
open
ended
midterm
bargaining.
it
has
specifically
provided
for
the
basic
structure,
and
so
that
is
not
a
permissible
subject
of
bargaining.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
well,
if
the
flra
interpreted
it
in
exactly
that
way,
which
it
hasn't
up
until
this
point,
it
would
improve
the
matter
some,
but
you
would
still
have
all
the
unforeseen
issues
that
can
be
raised,
and
a
union
really,
in
this
context,
when
it
can
take
an
issue
to
impasse
and
then
take
the
issue
to
the
binding
arbitration,
has
an
incentive
to
raise
any
issue
of
any
concern--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--to
any
federal
employee--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--we
have
not
had
experience
in
a
regime
in
which
this
court
has
said,
there
is
a
duty
to
bargain
midterm.
what
we
have
had
experience
with
is
a
regime
in
which
the
d.c.
circuit
has
said
there
is
such
a
duty
and
the
fourth
circuit
has
said
that
there
is
not.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
i
believe
it
was--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--it
was
about
5
years,
and
i
frankly
do
not
know
the
dimensions
of
the
problem,
but
the
fact
of
the
matter
is,
a
d.c.
circuit
decision
is
very
different
than
a
decision
from
this
court.
i
would
not
want
to
gauge
or
predict
what
the
experience
will
be
after
a
decision
by
this
court
based
on
a
single
court
of
appeals
decision.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
it
is
an
alternative
venue,
but
there
are
many
other
venues
for...
as
the
fourth
circuit
case's
experience
indicates
for
federal
agencies
to
go,
and
for
federal
agencies
that
did
not
want
to
engage
in
midterm
bargaining,
like
the
department
of
energy
and
the
department
of
interior
here,
there
was
an
option
to
take
the
issue
to
the
fourth
circuit,
and
that
would
be
true
in
many
other
circuits.
so
i...
in
point
of
fact,
i
just
don't
think
it's
a
fair
test
that
the
court--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--there
have
been
no
other
circuit
decisions
on
this
particular
issue,
on
midterm
bargaining,
other
than
the
d.c.
circuit
decision
in
the
fourth
circuit.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
i
would
say
what...
you
could
call
it
bargaining,
but
really
what
would
be
going
on
is
the
agency...
the
government
seeking
input
from
whatever
source
it
wants
to
to
solve
a
problem,
including
an
agency.
there's
nothing
wrong
with
the
federal
government
consulting
with
an
agency
when
a
problem
comes
up
midterm,
after
the
fact.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
yes.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
that
would
not
be
unlawful,
that's
correct.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
that's
correct.
not
only
that,
but
if
the
bargaining
did
not
seem
productive
from
the
agency's
point
of
view
it
could
cut
it
off,
and
it
would
not
be
an
unfair
labor
practice
of
not
bargaining
in
good
faith.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
that's
possible,
justice
stevens.
i
wouldn't
want
to
rule
out
single
after
the
fact
solutions
to
problems
on
particular
issues,
but
what
is
objectionable
here
is
a
clause
that
commits
the
agency
to
open
ended
midterm
bargaining
without
limit.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
i
think
that
congress
had
a
very
big
concern
that
it
expressed
in
7101(b),
that
this
statute
should
not
be
interpreted
in
a
way
that
threatens
the
effective
and
efficient
administration
of
justice,
and
that
is...
administration
of
the
government,
and
that
is
in
24(a).
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
that's--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--that's
correct
as
a
general
matter,
but
it
did
not
believe
that
unending
bargaining
would,
and
congress
recognized
that
there
were
special
needs,
and
that's
what
7101(b)
reflects,
that
there
are
special
needs
in
the
federal
government
and
in
government
in
general
that
there
have
to
be
reasonable
limitations
that
are
not
present
in
the
private
sector.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
well,
i
think
there
are
two
things.
one
is
the
text
of
the
act,
which
is
very
different.
there
was
an
open
ended
duty
to
bargain
collectively
in
the
national
labor
relations
act,
subject
to
a
specific
exception
for
matters
contained
in
the
agreement.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
well,
there
was
an
open
ended
duty
to
bargain
collectively,
which
the
national
labor
relations
act...
authority,
the
nlrb
interpreted
to
lead
to
wide
open
bargaining,
and
then
congress
cut
that
back
to
the
contained
in.
but
even
the
open
ended
term,
bargain
collectively,
is
bigger
than
the
term
here,
which
is
bargaining
for
the
purpose
of
arriving
at
a
collective
bargaining
agreement,
a
narrower
obligation
than
the
original
nlr...
national
labor
relations
act
duty
that
was
subsequently
reduced.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
justice
scalia,
i
was
going
to
make
that
point
first
but
i
thought
the
text
would
go
first
better.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
but
that
is...
yes,
justice
scalia,
that's
absolutely
correct.
that
was
the
second
enormous
difference
that
congress
faced
when
it
was
looking
at
this
act
as
it
compared
to
the
private
sector
experience.
the
kind
of
incentives
that
would
be
in
play
for
midterm
bargaining
are
just
completely
different,
and
when
you
can
take
every
issue
to
impasse,
you
have
the
incentive
to
raise
any
issue
of
any
concern
to
any
federal
employee--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--i...
justice
stevens,
what
happens
is
that
unions
do
not
raise
things
midterm
in
the
private
sector
unless
they
are
of
crucial
importance,
and
therefore
there
isn't
a
lot
of
union
initiated
midterm
bargaining
in
the
private
sector
because
their
only
recourse
is
to
strike
at
impasse,
and
it
was
something
which
is
very
difficult
to
accomplish
midterm
except
over
some
very
crucial
issue.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
justice
kennedy,
i
think
we
cited
in
our
brief
a
text
that
talked
about
that
this
was
something
that
was
not
done
very
frequently,
and
i
think
that
the
law
review
article
that
we
refer
to
also
in
the
brief
discussed
the
fact
that
this
is
not
something
that
is
done
in
the
private
sector
very
often.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
if
the
court
has
nothing
further--
