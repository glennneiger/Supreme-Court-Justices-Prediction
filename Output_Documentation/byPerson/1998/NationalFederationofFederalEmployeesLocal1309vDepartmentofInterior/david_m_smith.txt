mr.
david
m.
smith
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court--
this
case
involves
the
federal
labor
relations
authority's
interpretation
of
its
own
organic
statute.
the
authority
has
concluded
that
the
federal
service
labor
management
relations
statute
obligates
an
agency
to
bargain
over
union
initiated
proposals
offered
during
the
term
of
a
collective
bargaining
agreement.
mr.
david
m.
smith
mr.
chief
justice,
the
federal
labor
relations
authority
indeed
did
originally
come
down
on
the
opposite
side
of
this
question
in
its
irs
i
decision.
however,
subsequent
to
the
reversal
by
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
the
authority
reevaluated
the
issue
and
changed
its
mind,
and
decided
that
the
statute
did,
in
fact,
obligate
the
agency
to
bargain.
mr.
david
m.
smith
the
authority
has
in
several
cases,
your
honor,
chosen
to
nonacquiesce
in
a
court
of
appeals
decision
with
which
it
disagreed.
we
cite
in
brief
cases
where
we've
done
this
when
we
disagreed,
so
the
authority
could
have,
given
the
multiple
venue
provisions
of
our
statute,
have
chosen
not
to
have
followed
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia's
decision
in
this
case,
but
did,
in
fact,
reconsider
its
original
position
and
decide
that
the
d.c.
circuit
was,
in
fact,
correct.
mr.
david
m.
smith
yes,
justice
kennedy,
the
authority
has,
on
numerous
occasions,
subsequent
to
its
irs
ii
decision
in
1987,
adhered
to
the
position
it
took
in
irs
ii
and
determined
that
mid
term
collective
bargaining
is
required
under
the
statute.
the
authority
said
originally
in
the
case
on
remand
from
the
district
of
columbia
that
it
had
reconsidered
the
issue
and
thought
the
district
of
columbia
court
of
appeals
was
correct
and,
despite
several
reversals
by
the
fourth
circuit
court
of
appeals,
the
authority
has
stuck
to
its
position.
this
has,
in
fact,
been
our
position
since
1987.
mr.
david
m.
smith
that's
correct.
mr.
david
m.
smith
well,
he
will,
of
course,
tell
you
on
whose
behalf
he
is
appearing.
i
appear
on
behalf
of--
mr.
david
m.
smith
--i
think
we
interpret
the
statute
differently.
the
agencies
of
government
have
a
view--
mr.
david
m.
smith
--well,
there
are
several
points
raised
there,
justice
scalia.
we
don't
think
deference
is
required
in
this
case
because
we
think
the
statute
is
clear
that
there
is
an
obligation
to
bargain
midterm.
if
you
think
it
unclear,
yes,
we
would
seek
deference
in
this
case.
the
congress,
of
course,
passed
the
federal
service
labor
management
relations
statute.
while
it
was
signed
by
a
president
we
are,
in
effect,
carrying
out
the
will
of
the
congress,
not
necessarily
the
will
of
the
president,
in
what
we
do
vis
a
vis
federal
sector
labor
relations.
mr.
david
m.
smith
that
is,
of
course,
correct,
justice
ginsburg,
and
on
the
several
occasions
when
we've
had
the
privilege
of
being
before
the
court
before,
we
are
virtually
always
in
opposition
with
agencies
on--
mr.
david
m.
smith
--justice
scalia,
i
would
only
point
out
that
the
members
of
the
authority
are
on
a
quasi
independent
body.
as
you
noted
in
your
question
to
me
earlier,
they
are
appointed
by
the
president,
confirmed
by
the
congress,
and
can
only
be
removed
by
the
congress
for
good
cause,
so
the
president
in
the
scheme
of
things--
mr.
david
m.
smith
--well,
at
the
end
of
the
day,
congress'
statute
has
articulated
several
rights
that
federal
sector
employees
have
when
they
bargain
collectively
under
the
statute,
and
if
it
is
that
we
read
the
statute
different
from
the
agencies
of
government,
so
be
it.
mr.
david
m.
smith
well,
clearly
congress
can,
mr.
chief
justice,
do
things
to
regulate
the
way
the
executive
deals
with
its
employees.
we've--
mr.
david
m.
smith
--perhaps
it
is,
but
we
are
at
this
point
reevaluating
some
20
years
of
judicial
review
of
authority
decisions,
and
disagreements
between
the
federal
labor
relations
authority
and
agencies
of
government
over
what
the
federal
service
labor
management
relations
statute
requires
are
not
rare.
they're
commonplace.
mr.
david
m.
smith
in
point
of
fact,
one
of
the
points
we
make,
justice
o'connor,
is
it's
very
seldom
come
up.
the
basis
upon
which
the
authority
originally
thought
that
there
was
no
right
to
engage
in
midterm
bargaining,
and
upon
which
the
fourth
circuit
specifically
concluded
that
there's
no
right
to
engage
in
midterm
bargaining,
was
that
this
would
cause
enormous
disruption
to
the
government,
it
would
lead
to
inefficiencies,
and
all
the
rest.
well,
we're
here
after
11
years
of
midterm
bargaining
being
the
law
of
the
land
in
every
court
of
appeals
in
this
country
except
the
fourth,
and
there
are
no
problems.
there
are
no
cases.
we've
had
no
controversies.
mr.
david
m.
smith
yes,
there
have.
mr.
david
m.
smith
well,
yes,
there
have,
but
to
a
certain
extent
we're
in
the
complaint
business.
we
don't
know
when
there's
a
request
to
engage
in
midterm
bargaining
and
it
goes
down
without
a
dispute,
but
what
comes
to
the
attention
of
the
federal
labor
relations
authority
and
the
courts
is
when
there
is
a
disagreement
over
whether
or
not
there's
an
obligation
to
engage
in
midterm
bargaining,
and
there
have
been
few
disagreements
that
have
come
forth.
mr.
david
m.
smith
the...
noted
in
the
copetitioner's
brief
are
only
five
instances
in
some
12
years
that
there
have
been
disputes
resolved
by
the
federal
service
impasses
panel
involving
midterm
bargaining,
so
they've
been
rare
indeed.
mr.
david
m.
smith
i
don't
know
that
i
understand
the
use
of
the
word
curious.
it's
more
limited
than
that,
though,
because
as
we
point
out
the
obligation
and
the
right
to
engage
in
midterm
bargaining
only
pertains
to
matters
that
are
not
contained
in
or
covered
by
the
collective
bargaining
agreement,
which
of
course
is--
mr.
david
m.
smith
--the
rule
in
the
private
sector.
mr.
david
m.
smith
justice
breyer,
the
authority
reads
the
statute
as
creating
an
obligation
to
engage
in
midterm
bargaining
without
limitation.
however,
we
think
that
rule
would
not
be
appropriate,
so
we
have
developed
and
applied
the
private
sector
rule
to
the
federal
sector.
mr.
david
m.
smith
if
the
union...
i
want
to
be
clear--
mr.
david
m.
smith
--on
matters
that
are
not
covered
in
the
collective
bargaining
agreement.
mr.
david
m.
smith
yes.
mr.
david
m.
smith
it
requires
midterm
bargaining
because
there's
a
broad
obligation
in
the
statute
to
bargain
with
no
limitation
on
the
time
or
circumstances
when
bargaining
is
to
occur.
mr.
david
m.
smith
absent
the
authority's
contained
and
covered
by
policy
which
the
authority
has
adopted
to
place
reasonable
constraints
on
midterm
bargaining,
it
would.
mr.
david
m.
smith
certainly
the
agencies
can
bargain
for
zipper
clauses
to
put
an
end
to
any
midterm
bargaining,
and
that
could
be
a
provision
in
a
collective
bargaining
agreement.
mr.
david
m.
smith
we
don't
start
with
the
premise
that
the
entire
agreement
is
up
for
midterm
bargaining.
the
premise
is,
those
portions
of
the
agreement
that
are...
those
matters
that
are
not
contained
in
the
agreement
can
be
negotiated
midterm.
mr.
david
m.
smith
there
are
many
broad
divisions
in
our
statute
that
provide
for
basic
rights
without
limitation
and
without
explanation.
it's
the
authority's
responsibility,
as
this
court
has
recognized
in
interpreting
decisions
of
the
national
labor
relations
board,
to
fill
in
the
gaps.
mr.
david
m.
smith
yes,
sir.
i--
mr.
david
m.
smith
--i
don't
think
so.
i
thought
i'd
answered
that
question.
absent
the
authority's
contained
and
covered
by
doctrine,
which
of
course
is
adopted
from
the
private
sector,
i
think
there
would
be
no
specific
limitation
on
the
right
to
engage
in
midterm
bargaining.
mr.
david
m.
smith
that's
correct.
mr.
david
m.
smith
it
would,
of
course,
depend
on
the
nature
of
the
bargaining
history
and
what
transpired
at
the
bargaining
table.
if
it
was
dropped
in
exchange
for
another
concession,
yes,
it
would
be
barred,
but
i'm
reluctant
to--
mr.
david
m.
smith
--i--
mr.
david
m.
smith
--i
think
that's--
mr.
david
m.
smith
--yes.
mr.
david
m.
smith
that's
our
point.
i'd
like
to--
mr.
david
m.
smith
--in
the
authority's
irs
ii
decision,
mr.
chief
justice,
we
broadened
the
matters
that
would
be
precluded
to
include
matters
that
were
contained
in
or
covered
by
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
and
matters
that
were
waived,
either
waived
by
bargaining
history,
or
waived
by
a
zipper
clause.
if
i
could
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time.
mr.
david
m.
smith
the
very
first
sentence
of
the
federal
service
labor
management
relations
statute
notes
that
congress
has
examined
both
the
public
and
private
sectors
and
has
determined
that
collective
bargaining
is
in
the
public
interest.
that
collective
bargaining
as
set
out
in
the
statute
has
no
limitation
as
to
the
circumstances
when
it
must
occur.
we've
heard
the
respondent
offer
their
spin
of
what
collective
bargaining
agreements
mean.
they
don't
look
to
the
term
of
art
in
the
statute
set
out
in
section
7103(a)(8).
instead
they
say,
this
is
what
it's
come
to
mean
in
the
private
sector.
in
point
of
fact,
we
have
specific
terms
of
art
defined
in
the
statute
before
you
that
tell
you
what
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
is--
mr.
david
m.
smith
--that
isn't
so
in
the
wording
of
our
statute,
justice
breyer.
mr.
david
m.
smith
we
have
the
word
local
agreement
used
in
our
statute
to
describe
agreements
entered
into
at
the
local
level
between
those
that
are
not
at
the
national
level,
so
there's
one
example
for
you
where
the
word
is
used.
that
is
specifically
set
out
in
section
7114(c)(4)
of
the
statute.
mr.
david
m.
smith
yes.
mr.
david
m.
smith
which
would
disprove
their--
mr.
david
m.
smith
--which
would
disprove
the
point
that
there's
only
one
collective
bargaining
agreement
and
everything
else
is
simply
a
modification
or
a
supplement
to
it.
our
view
is
there
can
be
numerous
collective
bargaining
agreements,
and
their
view
that
any
side
agreement
entered
into
as
a
result
of
a
management
initiated
change
is
a
supplement
to
or
an
addition
to
finds
no
warrant
in
the
statute.
there's
no
suggestion
in...
any
place
in
the
statute
that
says
these
subsequent
agreements
are
supplement
to
a
comprehensive
term
agreement.
in
fact,
the
words,
comprehensive
term
agreements,
are
not
found
in
the
statute.
if
i
could
address
one
other
matter
briefly,
we
have
not
talked
about
the
negotiability
of
this
provision.
we
stand
on
the
statutory
right
analysis
and
we
believe,
in
fact,
there
is
a
right
to
engage
in
midterm
bargaining.
