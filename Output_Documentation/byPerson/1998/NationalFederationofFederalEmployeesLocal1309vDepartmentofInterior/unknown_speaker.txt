unknown
speaker
didn't
the
agency
at
one
time
have
a
different
position
and
then
changed
its
position
just
as
a
result
of
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
of
the
district
of
columbia
circuit?
unknown
speaker
how
much
choice
did
it
have
in
the
light
of
the
court
of
appeals
decision?
unknown
speaker
are
the
terms
and
the
substance
of
the
reconsideration
set
forth
on
remand
from
the
agency
in
the
irs
case?
has
the
agency
issued
any
other
adjudicative
dispositions
or
any
rules
to
indicate
that
it
continues
to
adhere
to
this
position
and
to
add
to
its
reasoning
in
any
respect?
unknown
speaker
mr.
smith,
you're
here
representing
the
authority
which
is,
as
i
recollect,
three
individuals,
no
more
than
two
of
whom
can
be
from
the
same
political
party,
appointed
for
5
years
and
not
removable
except
for
cause.
unknown
speaker
and
also
appearing
is...
in
today's
argument
is
the
solicitor
general,
who,
i
suppose,
is
appearing
on
behalf
of
the
president
of
the
united
states.
unknown
speaker
well,
so
we
have
a
disagreement
between
these
three
individuals
and
the
president
of
the
united
states
regarding
a
statute
that
goes
to
the
internal
management
of
the
personnel
of
the
executive
branch.
is
that
a
fair
description
of
what's
going
on
here?
unknown
speaker
and
you
want
us
to
give
deference
to
these
three
members
of
the
federal
labor
relations.
authority
in
preference
to
the
views
of
the
president
of
the
united
states
as
to
what
the
efficient
management
of
the
personnel
of
the
executive
branch
requires?
unknown
speaker
mr.
smith,
how
could
it
be
the
will
of
the
executive,
since
the
executive
is
always
an
adversary
in
all
the
proceedings
that
are
before
the
flra,
so
congress
set
you
up
to
be
an
arbiter
between
the
unions
and
the
federal
executive.
unknown
speaker
i'm
not
questioning
whether
you're
an
arbiter.
of
course
you
are.
but
the
question
is,
do
you
come
here
with
some
assumption
of
validity
of
what
you
have
done
in
the
narrow
situation
where
what
is
at
issue
is
the
internal
management
of
the
personnel
of
the
executive
branch,
and
the
president
has
chosen
to
disagree
with
you
to
such
a
degree
that
he's
willing
to
go
to
court
about
it?
i
mean,
initially,
very
often
two
agencies
of
the
government
disagree,
and
that
is
usually
resolved
internally,
but
here
we
have
two
agencies
disagreeing,
and
they've
come
to
the
court
and
asked
us
to
settle
it
and
the
question...
it's
a
very
narrow
question
i'm
asking.
in
settling
this
particular
question,
do
you
really
think
we...
it
fits
our
scheme
of
government
to
give
deference
to
these
three
individuals,
never
elected
by
anyone,
appointed
without
removal
power
by
the
president,
over
the
views
of
the
president,
and
i
have
serious
doubts
whether
it's
proper
to
give
deference
in
that
situation.
unknown
speaker
but
congress
is
not
free
to
create
any
scheme
of
things
it
wishes.
i
mean,
maybe
congress
does
want
that
scheme
of
things
and
does
not
want
the
president
to
be
in
control
of
the
personnel
of
the
executive
branch,
but
i...
that's
just
not
the
way
i
read
the
constitution.
unknown
speaker
maybe
the
pendleton
act,
passed
back
in
1983,
was
unconstitutional,
if
congress
can't
do
anything
to
regulate
the
way
the
executive
deals
with
federal
employees.
unknown
speaker
well,
it
can
tell
them,
as
the
pendleton
act
did,
just
what
the
president
must
do,
but
it
can't
tell
the
president
to
obey
somebody
else
as
to
how
he
should
treat
federal
employees.
isn't
that
a
different
question?
unknown
speaker
mr.
smith,
tell
me
a
little
about
the
practicalities
of
this
situation.
since
the
cadc
decision
saying
that
midterm
bargaining
is
allowable,
how
often
has
that
been
sought
in
the
jurisdiction
of
the
district
of
columbia
by
unions
with
federal
employees?
unknown
speaker
well,
have
there
been
requests
by
the
unions
for
midterm
bargaining?
unknown
speaker
and...
frequently?
unknown
speaker
well,
because
within
the
cadc
you've
taken
the
position
that
it's
okay,
so
it
just
goes
forward.
do
you
know
how
often
that
these
requests
have
resulted
in
arbitration
so
that
it's
resolved?
unknown
speaker
this
is
a
very
curious
proposal
for
midterm
bargaining,
a
provision
that
says,
we
have
the
right
to
have
midterm
bargaining,
isn't
it?
i
mean,
it's
a
very
curious
provision
that
was
sought
after
in
this
case.
unknown
speaker
where
does
that--
unknown
speaker
--where
does
that
come
from?
i
mean,
i
can
understand
a
position
that
says
the
flra
has
the
power
to
decide
when
or
whether
midterm
bargaining
should
exist
and
what
sorts,
but
you're
saying
it
doesn't
have
the
power,
that
even
if
it
thinks
midterm
bargaining
is
terrible,
it
has
to
allow
it
because
of
the
statute,
so
if
that's
so,
then
why
can't
they
reopen
in
the
middle
of
the
term
every
closed
agreement?
unknown
speaker
where...
if
you're
talking
about
the...
your
position
differing
from
the
government
i
would
be
repeating
myself,
but
i
don't
see
how
you
can
read
the
statute
as
you
do,
which
is
that
it
forces
midterm
bargaining,
it
requires
it.
that's
your
position,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
it
requires
it
at
the
request
of
the
union.
unknown
speaker
where
does
it
say
that
in
the
statute?
what
i
don't
see
is
how
you
can
say
the
statute
requires
midterm
bargaining,
but
by
the
way,
only
on
certain
subjects,
in
a
statute
that
says
not
a
word
about
midterm
bargaining.
that's
why
i'm
having
trouble.
i'd
like
you
to
explain...
i
can
understand
how
a
statute
could
delegate
to
the
agency
the
power
to
decide
whether
and
under
what
circumstances,
et
cetera,
et
cetera,
namely
the
sg's
position,
i
think,
basically.
unknown
speaker
but
i
don't
understand
the
position
that
it
would
require
midterm
bargaining
even
if
the
authority
were
to
say,
midterm
bargaining's
the
worst
idea
we've
ever
heard
of.
unknown
speaker
okay,
so
in
your
view,
if
they
come
in,
the
union,
and
they
say,
we
signed
an
agreement
3
weeks
ago,
and
it
promised
to
say
nothing
for
10
years,
but
by
the
way,
we
want
to
reopen
everything
right
today,
midterm,
in
your
view,
does
the
statute
require
that?
unknown
speaker
mr.
smith,
i
don't
understand
that,
because
i
thought
that
the...
that
even
the
d.c.
circuit
had
made
it
clear
that
you
could
have
a
zipper
clause,
so
as
justice
breyer
phrased
the
question,
the
union
could
say
in
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
we
promise
not
to
ask
for
midterm
bargaining
during
the
term
of
this
contract.
so
the
answer
to
his
question
is
the
zipper
clause,
but
that
would
be
something
to
bargain
for,
is
that
not
so?
unknown
speaker
why
couldn't
the
union
come
around
in
midterm
and
say,
by
the
way,
we
want
to
renegotiate
the
zipper
clause?
i
mean,
how
can
you
lift
yourself
by
your
own
petard
that
way?
if
the
entire
agreement
is
up
for
midterm
bargaining,
why
isn't
the
zipper
clause
up
for
midterm
bargaining?
unknown
speaker
that
was
justice
breyer's
point.
i
don't
know
where
you
get
that
limitation
from.
it's
contained
in
the
national
labor
relations
act,
but
it's
not
contained
in
your
legis...
i
mean,
there's
a
significant
difference
between
the
two,
and
i
would
think,
if
that
difference
meant
anything,
it
would
mean
that
everything
is
negotiable
midterm
if
anything
is
negotiable
midterm.
unknown
speaker
well,
when
you
fill
in
the
gaps
on
the
general
question
of
the
permissibility
or
perhaps
the
obligatory
nature
of
midterm
bargaining,
i
assume
that
what
you're
doing
is
interpreting,
if
i
remember
the
statute
correctly
you're
interpreting
the
phrase,
reasonable
in...
the
word
reasonable
in
reasonable
times
as
those
times
at
which
collective
bargaining
is
obligatory.
am
i
right
that
you're
saying,
well,
midterm
bargaining
is
a
reasonable
time?
that's
what
you're
interpreting,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
okay.
do
you
have
a
similar
word
that
you're
interpreting
when
you
come
to
the
conclusion
that
they
are
obliged
to
bargain
on
matters
which
are
not
covered
by
the
agreement
but
they
in
fact
would
be
precluded
from
bargaining
on
matters
that
are
covered?
is
there
a
textual
basis
for
it
the
way
there
is
on
the
time
question?
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
you
just
a
technical
question
about
the
agency's
position?
you
say
that
midterm
bargaining
with
respect
to
a
matter
covered
by
the
agreement
would
be
barred.
i
think
it's
the
position
that
a
matter
that
the
union
had
raised
and
had
failed
to
get
an
agreement
on,
in
other
words
which
it
had
dropped
in
the
initial
collective
bargaining,
would
also
be
barred?
is
that
correct?
unknown
speaker
what
about
a
matter
raised
by
the
governmental
agency
upon
which
nobody
got
any
agreement
in
the
collective
bargaining
agreement?
would
that
be
barred
as
well?
unknown
speaker
well,
is
the
rule
exactly
the
same
whether
the
union
wanted
something
or
whether
the
agency
wanted
something--
unknown
speaker
--which
did
not
find
its
way
into
an
express
provision
of
the
collective
bargaining
agreement?
unknown
speaker
you
treat
each
side
identically?
unknown
speaker
so
that
i
suppose,
then,
the
agency
could
protect
itself,
as
it
were,
from
being
subject
to
midterm
bargaining
on
a
subject
that
it
didn't
want
to
be...
it
didn't
want
to
have
to
bargain
on
midterm,
simply
by
raising
it
and
trying
to
get
an
agreement
favorable
to
itself,
and
if
it
failed,
that
would
be
it
until
the
collective
bargaining...
the
original
collective
bargaining
agreement
itself
came
up
for
renewal,
is
that
right?
unknown
speaker
so
it's
not
just
things
that
are
covered
by
the
agreement,
then,
that
are...
you're
precluded
from
midterm
bargaining,
but
things
that
were
raised
and
not
made
into
an
agreement
at
the
bargaining
session?
unknown
speaker
okay.
thank
you.
thank
you,
mr.
smith.
mr.
o'duden.
unknown
speaker
well,
it's
almost
tautological,
too,
that
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
is
the
result
of
collective
bargaining.
unknown
speaker
what
about...
just...
i
just
want
to
be
sure
you
focus
on...
i
see
a
broad
word.
unknown
speaker
i
see
an
authority.
unknown
speaker
it
looks
a
little
like
the
nlrb,
looks
a
little
like
the
labor
statutes,
a
little
like
a
lot
of
statutes
that
delegate
to
the
authority
questions
to
decide
what
is
or
is
not...
to
fill
in
the
blanks.
so
what
i
don't
get
is
the
position
that
says,
they
don't
have
the
authority
to
fill
in
the
blanks.
they
have
to,
no
matter
what
they
think--
unknown
speaker
--permit
midterm
bargaining.
unknown
speaker
that's
exactly...
i
understand
that
argument.
unknown
speaker
i'm
saying
the
reason
my
question
is
on
a
different
argument
is
on
your
position
which
is
more
extreme
than
that,
which
is
the
position
that
says,
even
if
they
think
it's
a
terrible
idea,
they'd
still
have
to
allow
it
because
the
statute
requires
it.
that's
the
argument
i
don't
fully
understand,
and
why
i
was
asking.
unknown
speaker
yes.
you--
unknown
speaker
--in
other
words,
are
you
satisfied
with
the...
you
think
the
law
is
correctly
satisfied
with
an
opinion
that
says,
these
things
are
up
to
the
authority.
language
is
broad,
up
to
the
authority.
if
they
think
it's
a
good
idea--
unknown
speaker
--sometimes,
always...
yes,
all
right.
unknown
speaker
well,
that
argument
has
to
rest
on
your
notion
that
the
statute,
then,
is
not
clear,
it's
ambiguous
on
the
question.
if
you
leave
it
open
to
the
authority,
then
you
have
to
say
the
statute's
ambiguous,
that's
why
it's
open
to
the
authority.
unknown
speaker
and
that's
your
position.
unknown
speaker
yes?
that
is
your
position?
unknown
speaker
well,
then
you
haven't
answered
my
question,
because
i'm
confused.
is
it
your
position
that
the
statute
is
ambiguous,
or
is
it
clear?
unknown
speaker
well,
if
the
statute
is
clear,
then
the
authority
would
not
have
an
option.
it
has
to
be
one
way
or
the
other,
i
think.
unknown
speaker
well,
it's
a
pretty
good
argument
in
light
of
the
fact
that
a
court
of
appeal
has
differed
from
the
d.c.
circuit
and
says
yes,
indeed,
the
statute
requires
something
else.
i
mean,
it
does
appear
to
be
somewhat
ambiguous.
you
can't
find
in
the
text
anything
referring
to
midterm
bargaining,
certainly.
unknown
speaker
and
you
do
find
in
the
text
references
to
a
collective
bargaining
agreement.
unknown
speaker
not
a
continuing
process.
unknown
speaker
well,
you
really
have
two
positions,
don't
you?
one
is
the
statute
is
clear
and,
second,
if
the
court
doesn't
agree
with
that,
it's
at
least
ambiguous
and
the
agency
could
do
what
it's
done
here.
unknown
speaker
mr.
o'duden,
before
you
finish,
i
do
hope
that
you
will
get
to
what
seems
to
me
a
very
key
issue
here.
it's,
chief
judge
wilkinson
put
great
stress
on
the
absence
of
a
provision
like
8(d).
he
said,
if
you're
trying
to
be
like
the
nlrb,
the
nlra
says,
specifically
says
no
bargaining
on
subjects
that
are
already
included
in
the
contract.
the
flra
doesn't
have
similar
language
to
deal
with.
unknown
speaker
but
was
there
any
question
whether
they
had
to
engage
in
it
even
with
regard
to
issues
that
had
been
decided
in
the
collective
bargaining
agreement?
unknown
speaker
which
is
why
they
adopted
the
proviso.
unknown
speaker
so
by
parity
of
reasoning,
without
the
proviso,
they
would...
if
you
say,
they
must
bargain
midterm,
it
seems
to
me
they
must
bargain
midterm
on
everything.
i
don't
know--
unknown
speaker
--you're
telling
us
the
statute
is
clear,
as
your
argument
number
1.
unknown
speaker
how
about
with
respect
to
the
obligation
to
engage
in
midterm
bargaining
with
respect
to
matters
previously
bargained
upon?
unknown
speaker
well,
if
you
think
the
statute
is
clear
that
there
must
be
midterm
bargaining,
i
don't
know
where
you
get
this
qualification.
you're
the
one
that
wanted
to
walk
through
the
statutory
text.
unknown
speaker
but
you...
what
is
it
you
point
to
to
show
that
there
may
not
be
midterm
bargaining
with
respect
to
matters
previously
decided?
unknown
speaker
it
can
add
provisions
that
the
act
doesn't
contain?
it
can
say,
even
though
the
act
says
you
must
bargain
midterm
without
qualification,
we
are
going
to
import
a
qualification
because
it's,
quote,
appropriate?
that
goes
beyond--
unknown
speaker
--that's
what
justice
kennedy
asked
you,
is
it
a
construction
of
any
provision
in
the
statute,
and
you
can't
come
up
with
any.
unknown
speaker
so
well
settled
that
congress
found
it
necessary
to
say
it
explicitly
in
the
national
labor
relations
act.
if
it
was
so
well--
unknown
speaker
--thank
you,
mr.
o'duden.
mr.
gornstein,
we'll
hear
from
you.
unknown
speaker
on
the
threshold
question
raised
by
justice
scalia
as
to
whether
or
not
we
should
give
chevron
deference
to
the
petitioner
agency
here
rather
than
to
the
president
and
to
the
executive
branch
as
a
whole,
you
did
not
take
the
position
that
chevron
deference
cannot
be
given
to
the
petitioning
agency,
did
you?
unknown
speaker
well--
unknown
speaker
--well,
but
chevron
deference
means
that
because
of
this
delegation
it
develops
an
expertise,
does
it
not?
unknown
speaker
and
what
do
you
rely
on
primarily
for
saying
we
don't
owe
deference
to
this
decision?
unknown
speaker
so
you
also
take
the
position
that
the
text
is
clear
but
just
directly
contrary.
unknown
speaker
the
text
being
the
efficiency
of
government
text?
unknown
speaker
what
exactly
is
the
language
that
you
refer
to?
unknown
speaker
it's
the
singular,
a
collective
bargaining
agreement?
unknown
speaker
mr.
gornstein,
i
don't
understand
how
it
works
differently
on
the
union
side
than
it
does
on
the
management
side,
because
i
think
you
agree
that
if
management
wants
to...
chooses
to
negotiate
midterm,
it
can,
and
that
will
end
up
with
something,
some
kind
of
agreement,
whatever
you
call
it.
unknown
speaker
well
then,
why
can't
you
call
when
the
union
initiates
it
the
same
thing,
a
modification?
unknown
speaker
well,
do
you
read
the
effect
of
that
provision
as
negating
a
similar
authority
for
the
union?
unknown
speaker
you
read
the
provision
saying
that
if
management
makes
certain
changes
it
must
initiate--
unknown
speaker
--midterm
bargaining.
unknown
speaker
you
read
a
negative
in
that.
unknown
speaker
may
i
interrupt?
i'm
just
looking
at
(b)
now.
it
would
preclude
any
agency
and
any
labor
negotiation...
organization
from
negotiating.
that
doesn't
say
who
must
initiate
the
negotiation.
and
then
you
go
to
(2).
(2)
doesn't
tell
you
which
one
has
to
initiate
the
negotiation,
does
it?
procedures
which
management
officials
will
observe
in
exercising
any
authority.
unknown
speaker
but
mr.
gornstein--
--if
management
exercise
some...
put
into...
some
new
procedure
into
effect,
and
the
union
came
to
them
and
said,
we'd
like
to
negotiate
about
that
because...
would
they
have
to
negotiate
or
not?
unknown
speaker
this
is
a
midterm
request
that
we
now
negotiate
about
the
change
you've
just
made.
unknown
speaker
even
though
it's
a
midterm
request
made--
unknown
speaker
--you're
not
as--
--it's
only
the
procedures.
i
mean,
you
can
make
the
change.
you
just
have
to--
unknown
speaker
--why
doesn't
that...
the
author...
look,
that
particular
provision
that
justice
stevens
mentions
says...
doesn't
give
anybody
the
authority
to
negotiate
collective
bargaining.
if
the
management
says,
we're
going
to
contract
out,
and
if
the
union
says,
it's
midterm
but
we
want
to
protect
our
people
when
you
do,
you
have
the
right
to
do
it,
it
says...
it
says
nothing
precludes
them
from
negotiating
appropriate
arrangements
for
employees.
it
says
nothing
precludes
it.
well,
where
do
they
get
the
authority
to
do
it?
the
obvious
place
is
right
over
here
in
7114(a)(4),
where
it
says,
a
collective
bargaining
agreement,
which
isn't
defined
and,
since
it
isn't
defined,
the
obvious
thing
is
that
by
a
collective
bargaining
agreement,
they
meant...
well,
they
meant
whatever's
reasonable
given
the
whole
statute,
and
they
delegate
authority
to
the
flra
to
decide.
i
mean,
that
would
be
the
sort
of
basic,
naive
approach
to
this.
why
isn't
that
naive
approach--
unknown
speaker
--right,
yes.
unknown
speaker
all
right--
unknown
speaker
--the
other
side.
unknown
speaker
7106(b).
unknown
speaker
on
a
related--
unknown
speaker
--related,
why...
this
is...
might
be...
i...
you
know,
there's
a
general
authority
here,
as
there
is
with
most
agencies,
like
the
nlrb
and
others.
it
says
that
the
authority
has
broad
power
under
the
statute
to
resolve
issues
relating
to
the
duty
to
bargain
in
good
faith,
it
has
what
i'd
call
a
normal
agency
power
"to
take
such
other
actions
that
are
necessary
and
appropriate
to
effectively
administer
the
provisions.
"
so
given
those
normal
provisions,
i
don't
know
why
we'd
even
refer
to
chevron.
i
mean,
here
you
have
a
word,
a
collective
bargaining
agreement.
it's
very
broad.
it
should
be
stretched
at
least
to
cover
(b)(1),
(2),
and
(3),
and
you
have
a
general
delegation
of
authority
to
the
agency.
again,
i'm
putting
the
argument
because
i
want
to
get
your
response.
unknown
speaker
may
i
just
get
your
help,
because
i
really
am
having
trouble
with
following
part
of
your
argument.
i'm
looking
at
(b)(3),
about
appropriate
arrangements
for
employees,
and
supposing
an
agency
decides
to
contract
out
a
portion
of
the
work,
and
it
does
not
make
any
appropriate
arrangements
for
employees
whose
duties
will
be
changed
by
that
transfer.
you're
saying
that
it's
perfectly
clear
that
only
management
could
initiate
negotiations
to...
about
those
appropriate
arrangements?
unknown
speaker
does
that
mean
that
whenever
management
makes
a
significant
change
that
triggers
a
union
desire
to
negotiate
with
somebody,
in
that
case,
midterm
negotiation
initiated
by
the
union
would
be
appropriate?
unknown
speaker
where
do...
where
does
the
statute
say
that?
unknown
speaker
you
don't
get
that
out
of
the
text
of
the
statute.
unknown
speaker
well
then,
the...
then
it
isn't
all
clear
from
the
text
itself.
unknown
speaker
well,
why
just
midterm
bargaining?
i
mean,
as
i
read
(b)
it
would
have
been
procedures
or
the
exercise
of
authority
to
reassign
work,
which
occurred
in
the
past.
unknown
speaker
when
a
new
collective
bargaining
agreement,
as
you
use
the
term,
is
being
negotiated.
unknown
speaker
well
then,
doesn't
it
make
sense
that,
just
as
those
rights
would
otherwise
exist
for
the
collective
bargaining
agreement,
as
you
use
the
term,
those
rights
as
far
as
this
section
is
concerned
could
also
exist
midterm?
i
mean,
it
doesn't
narrow
in
on
some
nonexistence
of
midterm
authority.
it
just
says--
unknown
speaker
--yes.
unknown
speaker
does
that
mean
that
what
we're
fighting
about...
i
really
have
trouble
knowing
how
important
this
case
is,
that
if
you
concede
that
every
time
management
makes
a
change
it
has
a
duty
to
negotiate
about
it.
is
it
very
often
going
to
happen
that
the
union
is
going
to
request
midterm
bargaining
when
the
management
has
done
nothing?
unknown
speaker
i
see.
that's
what
you're
worried
about.
unknown
speaker
they
just
come
up
with
a
brand
new
idea.
give
me
an
example,
would
you.
unknown
speaker
give
me
a
specific
example
of
a
specific
kind
of
request
by
the
union
that
we're
fighting
about
in
this
case.
unknown
speaker
oh,
i
understand.
unknown
speaker
in
other
words,
the
union...
i
see.
unknown
speaker
the
union
initiates
a
request
for
more
parking
space
or
something.
unknown
speaker
okay.
i
have
trouble
with
7106(b)(1),
exactly
what
it
does.
it
says,
at
the
election
of
the
agency
you
can
negotiate,
and
then
it
has
some
things
that
would
appear
to
be
pretty
important.
does
that
mean
that
the
union
cannot
initiate
bargaining
about
the
subjects
in
(1)?
unknown
speaker
if
you're
right,
which
is
that
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
is
a
term
of
art,
always
meant
to
refer
to
the
end
of
term
agreements,
and
anything
in
the
middle
is
called
a
supplement
to
a
collective
bargaining
agreement--
unknown
speaker
--or
an
amendment
or
something
like
that,
then
what
would
forbid
a
union
and
the
agency
from
negotiating
in
what
you
consider
the
correct
end
of
term
agreement
a
promise
that
on
certain
matters
they
could
open
it
up
in
the
middle?
i
mean,
you
see...
does
that
require
any
stretch
of
the
statute?
i
mean,
that's
what's
really
before
us,
too,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
they
would
make
a
list.
they
make
a
list.
unknown
speaker
well,
to
be
specific,
then,
let
me
rephrase
it,
taking
your
definitions.
what
in
the
statute
would
forbid
them
from
at
the
end
of
term
putting
in
a
clause
that
says,
we
will
have
midterm
bargaining
on
matters
not
covered
by
this
agreement?
unknown
speaker
while
you're
on
that
section
of...
subsection
(12)
defines
collective
bargaining
so
that
the
units
have
to
negotiate...
meet
at
reasonable
times.
can't
you
say
that
in
the
event
of
a
change
in
the
workplace
it's
a
reasonable
time
to
negotiate
about
that
right
after
it
occurs?
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
(12)--
unknown
speaker
--but
(12)
defines
collective
bargaining
as
meeting
at
reasonable
times
to
reach
agreement,
not
a
collective
bargaining
agreement,
but
to
reach
agreement
with
respect
to
the
conditions
of
employment.
unknown
speaker
mr.
gornstein,
i'd
like
you
to
comment
on
the
opinion
in
the
d.c.
circuit
following
up
the
original
decision,
judge
edwards
and
judge
silberman
joining
and
saying,
this
is
all
a
tempest
in
a
teapot,
after
all,
the
agency
can
negotiate
for
a
zipper
clause,
and
that's
the
end
of
it.
unknown
speaker
how
about
a
reopener
clause?
unknown
speaker
has
the
flra
said
that
that's
okay?
unknown
speaker
that's
sought
here.
unknown
speaker
a
clause
like
the
one
that's
sought
here.
unknown
speaker
why
isn't
the
teapot
proportion
sort
of
dictated
by
the
position
that
mr.
smith
described
to
us,
that
the...
that
the...
that...
i
keep
wanting
to
say
the
board.
what
do
i
want
to
say?
the--
--authority.
the
authority
takes,
that
if
a
matter
has
been
raised
by
management
at
the
time
of
negotiating
the
basic
agreement
and
has
been
rejected
without
reaching
agreement,
that
subject
is
precluded
as
a
subject
of
bargaining
midterm.
why
doesn't
that
protect
management
and
reduce
the
argument
here
really
to
something
pretty
small?
unknown
speaker
then
why
hasn't--
unknown
speaker
--why
hasn't
it
been
doing
it
to
a
disturbing
degree
for
the
last
11
years
outside
the
fourth
circuit?
i
mean,
if
we
were...
if
this
were
the
first
day
of
creation,
i
think
you
might
have
a
stronger
argument
there,
but
we've
had
11
years'
experience,
and
it
doesn't
seem
to
have
become
a
source
of
great
difficulty.
unknown
speaker
but
not
for
a
while.
how
many
years
was
it
before
the
ssa
decision
in
the
fourth
circuit?
unknown
speaker
about
5
years?
unknown
speaker
except
that
that
court
of
appeals
is
in
a
rather
special
position,
because
it's
always
an
alternative
venue
in
these
cases.
unknown
speaker
have
there
been
circuits
that
have
followed
the
d.c.
circuit?
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
you
one
narrow
question?
supposing,
on
a
brand
new
subject,
the
union
asked
the
agency
to
bargain,
and
the
agency
said
yes,
we
will
bargain,
would
they
have
been
acting
lawfully?
unknown
speaker
no,
no,
the
federal
government
can...
i
was
talking
about
the
agency
consulting
with
the
union.
unknown
speaker
the
union
comes
in
and
says,
we
want
to
bargain
about
some
more
parking
spaces
and
they
say,
okay,
we'll
sit
down
and
bargain
with
you.
that
would
not
be
unlawful.
unknown
speaker
--but
the
key
is
that
it
would
not
go
to
arbitration
if
it
came
to
an
impasse.
unknown
speaker
could
they,
do
you
think,
say
well,
if
we
can't
agree
among
ourselves
we'll
let
it
be
arbitrated
by
the
agency?
unknown
speaker
is...
if
you
were
going
back
hypothetically,
putting
yourself
in
the
position
of
a
congressman
who
thought
this...
realized
this
was
all
going
to
come
up
years
later,
would
you
have
thought,
or
why
not...
i'm
putting
it
against
you.
wouldn't
it
have...
leave
it
up
to
the
agency.
you
know,
if
these
things...
we
don't
know
if
it
will
work
out
well
or
badly.
if
it
works
out
well,
then
they'll
follow
it.
if
it
works
out
badly,
the
flra
itself
will
change
the
rule,
as
it
might
have
the
authority
to
do.
wouldn't
that
be
a
practical...
if
we're
talking
practicalities,
isn't
that
practical?
unknown
speaker
but
congress
also
thought
that
collective
bargaining
would
advance
the
interest
of
the
government--
unknown
speaker
--in
efficient
management.
unknown
speaker
is
there
anything
that
suggested
that
congress
thought
that
the
agency
was
differently
situated
than
private...
in
the
private
sector,
where
by
this
time,
by
the
time
this
statute
is
enacted
midterm
bargaining
is
long
established?
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
there
was
no...
nothing
originally.
taft
hartley
brought
in
the
8(d)
exception,
but
originally
there
wasn't
anything
that
said,
there
shall
be
midterm
bargaining,
was
there?
unknown
speaker
the
big
difference,
as
i
understand
your
position,
is
that
there
is
no
disincentive
here
to
raise
it
midterm,
as
there
is
in
the
private
sector.
in
the
private
sector,
if
you
come
to
an
impasse
midterm
and
you
want
to
make
something
of
it,
you
have
to
call
a
strike.
after
you've
gone
through
a
big
collective
bargaining
agreement
you're
usually
not
going
to
get
your
union
members
to
be
willing
to
do
that.
whereas
here,
if
you
raise
it
midterm
and
you
go
to
an
impasse,
it's
cost
free.
you
go
to
an
arbitrator.
maybe
he'll
rule
for
you.
i
mean,
it's,
you
know,
heads
i
win,
tails
you
lose.
unknown
speaker
for
me
of
all
people.
yes.
he's
basically
a
policy--
[laughter]
basically
a
policy
wonk,
you're
right.
unknown
speaker
of
course,
i'm
not
really
convinced
that
every
mid
term
bargaining
in
the
private
sector
that
doesn't
reach
an
agreement
results
in
a
strike.
unknown
speaker
on
that
point,
is
there
some
source,
some
body
of
authority
that
we
could
consult
to
determine
how
midterm
bargaining
works
in
the
private
sector?
unknown
speaker
thank
you.
unknown
speaker
thank
you,
mr.
gornstein.
mr.
smith,
you
have
3
minutes
remaining.
unknown
speaker
well,
but
he
says
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
in
labor
relations
means
an
agreement
that's
negotiated
from
term
to
term,
and
anything
else
is
called
a
supplementary
agreement
or
an
additional
agreement.
now,
is
there
some
example
that
you
could
point
to
where
that
isn't
so?
unknown
speaker
no,
no,
but
i
mean,
let's
find...
that's
what's
at
issue,
so
let's
find
an
agreement
somewhere
that
was
made
midterm,
in
any
context
whatsoever,
where
it
was
labeled
by
some
person
in
a
case
or
in
a
statute
or
something
to
say
that's
a
collective
bargaining
agreement.
they
don't
use
the
word
supplementary
agreement.
they
don't
use
the
word
additional
agreement.
unknown
speaker
7114(c)(4)?
unknown
speaker
that
could
be
a
local
collective
bargaining
agreement
in
the
sense
that
the
solicitor
general
uses
it.
unknown
speaker
i
mean,
it
could
be
a
local
agreement
that
lasts
3
years,
couldn't
it?
