mr.
gregory
o'duden
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court--
i'd
like
to
spend
just
a
moment
taking
the
court
through
a
textual
analysis
here
and
explain
how
we
get
to
our
conclusion
that
midterm
bargaining
is
required
by
the
statute,
and
then
i'd
like
to
spend
a
moment,
if
i
could,
talking
about
the
practicalities
in
connection
with
midterm
bargaining.
the
question
was
asked
earlier,
where
is
it
in
the
statute
that
provides
for
the
flra's
conclusion
that
midterm
bargaining
is
required.
obviously,
if
you
look
at
the
statute
you
see
in
section
14(a)(4)
of
the
statute
that
it
imposes
on
the
agencies
and
the
unions
the
obligation
to
engage
in
bargaining
for
the
purpose
of
arriving
at
a
collective
bargaining
agreement.
well,
what
does
that
mean?
i
think
the
answer
to
that
is
to
be
found
in
the
statute's
definition
of
a
collective
bargaining
agreement.
when
you
turn
to
that
definition
in
7103(a)(12),
what
do
you
see?
you
see
that
it
says
that
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
is
an
agreement
entered
into
as
the
result
of
parties
bargaining.
that's
a
very
broad
definition.
it
includes--
mr.
gregory
o'duden
--that
is
the
way
congress
chose
to
define
it,
though,
in
a
very
broad
fashion
without
qualification,
without
temporal
limitation,
and
it
certainly
did
not
choose
to
define
that
phrase
as
the
respondent
wants
this
court
to
redefine
it,
namely,
to
mean
only
a
basic,
comprehensive
agreement.
mr.
gregory
o'duden
yes.
mr.
gregory
o'duden
yes.
mr.
gregory
o'duden
well,
of
course--
mr.
gregory
o'duden
--of
course,
to
the
extent
the
statute
is
ambiguous
the
authority
is
performing
a
classic
function.
mr.
gregory
o'duden
okay.
mr.
gregory
o'duden
even
if
the
authority
thought
it
was
a
terrible
argument?
mr.
gregory
o'duden
well,
i
think
that
the
statute
answers
the
question
that
is
presented
to
the
court,
and
that's
of
course
what
the
nteu
v.
the
flra
case
was
about.
mr.
gregory
o'duden
absolutely.
mr.
gregory
o'duden
and
of
course
it
was
just
a
couple
of
years
ago
in
the
fort
stewart
case
where
this
court
recognized
that
it
was
the
authority's
job
to
give
a
rational
interpretation
to
the
statute,
and
it
was
entirely
proper
to
give
deference
to
the
authority,
notwithstanding
the
fact
that
it
was
adjudicating
disputes
between
employees
and
federal
agencies.
mr.
gregory
o'duden
that's
right.
our
starting
point--
mr.
gregory
o'duden
--our
starting
point
is
that--
mr.
gregory
o'duden
--our
position
is
that
if
the
statute
is
ambiguous,
then
this
case
is
uniquely
suited
for
deferral
to
the
authority's
interpretation
of
those
words.
mr.
gregory
o'duden
no.
it
is
our
position
that
the
statute
answers
the
question
presented
to
the
court.
mr.
gregory
o'duden
no.
as
i
said
earlier,
i
don't
think
that
the
authority
does
have
an
option
to
conclude
anything
other
than
what
the
d.c.
circuit
said
10
years
ago,
but
to
the
extent
that
the
party,
the
respondent
is
now
suggesting,
as
the
fourth
circuit
did,
by
the
way,
that
the
language
is
ambiguous,
if
that
is
the
premise,
then--
mr.
gregory
o'duden
--no,
and
we've
never--
mr.
gregory
o'duden
--yes,
but--
mr.
gregory
o'duden
--but
that
begs
the
question,
of
course,
of
what
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
is,
and
that's
why
you
have
to
go
to
the
statutory
definition
of
that
phrase.
mr.
gregory
o'duden
that
sums
up
our
entire
argument,
your
honor.
mr.
gregory
o'duden
right.
i
think
that
the
absence
of
this
8(d)
proviso
ultimately
is
of
no
consequence
here.
i
think
it's
almost
counterintuitive.
it's
a
kind
of
no
exception
proves
no
rule
type
of
argument.
i
think
it's
important
to
bear
in
mind
that
even
before
this
8(d)
proviso
was
added
to
the
nlra
there
was
no
question
under
that
statute
that
employers
did
have
to
engage
in
midterm
bargaining.
i
think
that
the
principle--
mr.
gregory
o'duden
--i
believe
that
there
was
some
question
along
those
lines,
and
that's
why--
mr.
gregory
o'duden
--that's
why
they
adopted
the
proviso.
mr.
gregory
o'duden
well,
obviously
the
authority
has
interpreted
the
statute
in
a
different
way,
and
thought
it
was
appropriate
to
fill
that
gap
by
adopting
the
covered
by
doctrine.
mr.
gregory
o'duden
with
respect
to
the
obligation
to
engage
in
midterm
bargaining,
yes.
mr.
gregory
o'duden
as
my
cocounsel
says,
the
statute
doesn't
speak
to
that
directly,
and
that
is
the
reason
why
the
authority
filled
in
the
gap
to
furnish
the
covered
by
doctrine.
the
principle
that
the
parties--
mr.
gregory
o'duden
--yes,
i
do.
mr.
gregory
o'duden
i
think
that
that
is
an
appropriate
function
for
the
authority
to
have
performed
here
in
interpreting
the
policies
of
the
act
and
trying
to
balance
the
competing
interests
here
in
favor
of
collective
bargaining
versus
the
interest
in
having
repose
during
the
term
of
the
agreement.
mr.
gregory
o'duden
if
that
is
a
reasonable
construction
of
what
the
plan
of
the
statute
was,
yes,
i
think
it
is
appropriate.
mr.
gregory
o'duden
your
honor,
the
principle
that
the
parties
do
not
have
to
engage
in
bargaining
regarding
matters
contained
in
the
contract
is
such
a
well
settled
principle
of
labor
law,
it's
such...
a
principle
that's
so
well
integrated
into
the
labor
law
jurisprudence--
mr.
gregory
o'duden
--that
was
30
years
before
they
wrote
the
statute
and,
given
that
fact,
i
think
that
it's
hardly
surprising
that
congress
didn't
choose
to
spell
it
out
when
it
came
time
to
write
this
statute.
i
think
it's
important,
if
i
may
finish
by
emphasizing
the
benefits,
the
good
things
about
midterm
bargaining.
it
allows
the
parties
flexibility
to
deal
with
topics
that
are
not
covered
by
the
parties'
agreement
such
as
health
and
safety
issues
that
might
arise
during
the
term
of
the
agreement.
the
respondent
will
no
doubt
get
up
and
say
that
it
will
be
terribly
disruptive
to
the
federal
government
if
it
has
to
put
up
with
midterm
bargaining.
we
know
that
we
have
lived
with
this
regime
for
10
years
now
all
over
the
country,
except
for
the
fourth
circuit,
and
there's
simply
no
indication
of
any
kind
of
disruption
along
the
lines
that
are
described
by
the
respondent.
unless
there
are
further
questions,
i
thank
the
court
for
its
time.
