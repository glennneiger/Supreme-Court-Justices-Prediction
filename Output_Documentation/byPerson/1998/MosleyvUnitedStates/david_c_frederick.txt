mr.
david
c.
frederick
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
bank
larceny
is
not
a
lesser-included
offense
of
bank
robbery
under
the
statutory
elements
test
announced
by
this
court
in
schmuck
v.
united
states.
the
plain
language
of
the
statute--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--no,
justice
o'connor,
that's
not
correct,
because
even
if
you
were
to
read
in
an
intent
to
steal
element
in
the
bank
robbery
offense,
there
are
two
other
textual
indicators
that
suggest
strongly
that
schmuck
test
has
not
been
met.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
not
this
government,
justice
o'connor.
[laughter]
take
had
a
distinct
meaning
both
at
common
law
and
under
this
statute.
it
means
to
gain
caption
over.
carrying
away
is
to
move
while
supporting,
and
all
of
the
commentators
who
have
construed
those
terms
say
that
carrying
away
is
a
distinct
element,
that
one
could
gain
caption
over
property
in
a
bank,
commit
the
robbery
offense,
but
not
carry
that
property
away,
and
so
we
would
submit
that
the
omission
of
carried
away
is...
is
a
significant
omission
for
establishing
the
elements
test.
i
would
first--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--well,
that's
correct
in
those
common
law
jurisdictions
that
it
construed
carrying
away
to
go
beyond
the
curtilage
of
the
particular
edifice.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
we
would
prosecute
that
person,
and
we
would
argue
that
carrying
away
had
been
satisfied,
because
the
place
where
the
person
had
taken
the
money
or
gained
caption
over
it
very
likely
was
where
the
teller
is,
and
the
person
had--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--it's
a...
that's
correct,
justice
scalia.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
well,
the
commentators
noted
that
the
asportation
requirement
was
a
minimal
one.
justice
ginsburg,
in
further
response
to
your
question,
there
are
jurisdictions
that
would
not
have
found
larceny
on
those
facts
because
the
carrying
away
had
to
go
beyond
the
edifice,
and
typically
it
was
a
house
where
the
larceny
was--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--you
have
to
make
a
carrying-away
movement,
and
the
jury
must
find
that
after
it
has
been
put
in
the
indictment
and
proved
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
by
the
government.
in
the
same--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--no,
i...
in
the
same
way
that
the
government
must
plead
in
the
indictment
under
larceny
that
the
amount
taken
was
above
1,000
dollars
and
the
jury
must
find
that.
that
is
an
element
of
the
larceny
offense
and
not
an
element
of
the
bank
robbery
offense,
and
we
know
that--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--no.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
the
monetary
requirement,
or
the
feloniously
requirement.
i'm--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--yes,
but
let
me
explain
further,
because
the
asportation
requirement
was
a
requirement
of
robbery
at
common
law,
and
feloniously
did
not
encompass
the
asportation
requirement.
they
were
distinct.
if
you
look
at
blackstone,
blackstone
says
feloniously
takes
and
carries
away,
using
force
in
the
person
or
presence
of
another.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
so
if
i've
understood
the
multiple
parts
of
your
question--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--of
carrying
away,
that's
correct,
justice
souter.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
well,
i'm
glad
that
you
raised
morissette,
because
i
think
there
is
some
confusion
about
what
the
court
addressed
and
what
it
held.
the
court
in
morissette
did
not
hold
that
when
congress
has
defined
terms
using
non-common
law
words,
and
six
of
the
eight
elements
of
this
bank
robbery
statute
depart
from
the
common
law,
morissette
did
not
say
you
read
in
common
law
requirements.
in
fact,
in
morissette,
as
the
court
explains
in
footnote
28
of
its
opinion,
in
describing
the
drafting
history
of
section
641,
congress
used
the
word
converts,
which
was
a
common
law
word,
and
the
question
before
the
court
was,
what
did
congress
mean
when
it
used
the
word
converts?
it
had
not
appeared
in
any
of
the
predecessor
sections
of
that
statute,
and
so
what
the
court
held
was
that
in
tort
cases
a
conversion
could
occur
by
an
unwitting
action
if
there
was
some
negligence
or
something
in
the
interference
with
the
property
rights
of
the
true
owner.
so
in
reading...
but
at
common
law
the
crime
of
conversion
required
an
intent
to
steal,
so
what
the
court
held
in
morissette
was
that
because
congress
had
used
the
words,
knowingly
converts
in
a
crime,
that
it
must
have
meant
to
include
the
intent
to
steal,
because
otherwise
innocent
conduct
would
be
subject
to
the
criminal
sanction.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
well,
it
used
embezzlement
and
steal,
but
the
government's
prosecuted
theory--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--that's
correct.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
what
we
know,
justice
kennedy,
is
that
the
word
feloniously
was
removed
from
the
statute.
the
reviser's
notes
don't
explain
why.
the
reviser
just
simply
says
that
there
were
changes
in
phraseology,
so
we
do
not
know
what
congress
was
thinking
when
it
omitted
those
words.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
that's
unfortunately
correct,
justice
kennedy.
i
would
point
out
that
2
years
before
the--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--yes,
but
this
court
in
wells
held
that
an
omission
of
a
word
that
had
appeared
in
prior
versions
was
not
going
to
be
read
back
in,
and
materiality
in
wells
was
an
element
of
the
offense.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
that's
correct.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
2
years
before
congress
codified
the
laws
in
1948--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--it
enacted
a
definition
of
robbery
in
the
hobbs
act
which
did
not
contain
an
intent
to
steal,
but
which
underscored
the
seriousness
congress
attached
to
forceful
takings
of
property
in
the
presence
or
from
the
person
of
another,
and
it
is
clear,
as
judge
coffin
in
the
first
circuit
said
in
the
deleo
case
in
1970
that
the
acts
of
robbery
are
so
unambiguously
dangerous
as
to
make
implicit
the
mental
element
underlying
the
offense.
our
position
is
that
robbery
and
the
way
congress
has
defined
it
go
to
the
means
that
the
person
uses
to
take
the
property
from
another,
whereas
larceny
is
addressed
to
the
ends
that
the
person
intends
when
he
has
taken
the
property,
and
they
are
two
different
offenses.
robbery
is
an
offense
against
the
person,
and
larceny
is
an
offense
involving
property.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
there
are
cases
in
the
courts
of
appeals
that
hold
that
the
hobbs
act
does
not
require
an
additional
mental
element
of
intent
to
steal
or
other...
any
other
special
intent
requirement,
as
congress
drafted
in
three
different
provisions
of
the
bank
robbery
statute.
the
knowing,
knowing
that
the
stolen
property,
the
receiver
of
stolen
property
has
to
know
that
it
is
stolen
in
2113(c),
in
2113(b)
the
intent
to
steal,
and
in
second
paragraph,
2113(a),
the
bank
burglary
offense
congress
drafted
that
the
person
entering
the
bank
has
to
do
so
with
intent
to
commit
a
felony.
so
it
is
clear
that
there
are
specific
textual
indicators
of
this
statute
that
underscore
that
congress
knew
how
to
include
a
special
mental
element
but
did
not
do
so
in
the
bank
robbery
offense.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
that's
correct.
the--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--i
think
that's
reasonable,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
it
appears--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--traditionally
a
person
could
take
money.
a
person
who
goes
into
a
bank
has...
you
know,
fills
out
the
deposit
slip
or
the
withdrawal
slip
in
a
certain
way
and
takes
out
1,000
dollars,
intending
only
to
make
a
withdrawal
of
100
dollars,
and
the
teller
says,
hey,
wait
a
minute,
you've
just
walked
out
of
the
bank,
you
have
taken
1,000
dollars
from
the
care,
custody,
or
control
of
the
bank.
that
is
not
larceny
unless
the
person
had
the
intent
to
steal
the
money.
an
innocent
taking
would
not
be
criminalized
in
the
same
way
that
a
person
who
went
into
the
bank
with
a
gun
and
said
to
the
teller,
give
me
1,000
dollars,
would
be
regardless
of
what
the
robber
ultimately
intended
to
do
with
the
funds.
our
position
is
that
that
dangerous
activity
by
a
robber
fundamentally
makes
robbery
a
different
offense
from
larceny.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
yes.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
justice
breyer,
we
would
concede
that
a
case
arising,
a
question
under
second
paragraph
(b)
is
a
much
more
difficult
one
than
under
first
paragraph
(b),
but
let
me
emphasize,
and
i'm
looking
at
2a
of
the
appendix
to
our
brief
where
the
language
is
set
forth,
the
with...
not
exceeding
1,000
dollars
is
right
between
two
elements
of
the
offense.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
yes.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
the
first
paragraph
of
(b).
the
value
exceeding
1,000
dollars
occurs
between
two
elements
of
the
offense.
it
occurs
to
us
as
an
untenable
argument
to
make
that
exceeding
1,000
dollars
is
not
an
element
of
the
offense.
and
furthermore,
there
would
be
a
grand
jury
clause
problem
if
we
were
not
to
charge
it
in
the
indictment.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
i
would
concede
it
is
a
much
more
difficult
question,
but
let
me
point
out
that
in
either
circumstance
congress
was
talking
about
property
that
was
subject
to
monetization.
it
had
to
be
property
with
a
monetary
value.
there
are
circumstances
in
which
a
robber
could
ask
for
property
that
could
not
be
given
a
monetary
value
such
as,
give
me
the
blank
checks
that
are
in
your
till.
give
me
the
account
information
of
all
of
the
people
who
have
more
than
1
million
dollars
in
this
bank.
give
me
the
computer
access
codes
so
that
i
can
go
home
and
i
can
get
into
the
bank.
you
know,
that
kind
of
information
is
very
valuable
to
a
robber,
but
would
not
necessarily
be
subject
to
the
monetization
requirement,
and
the
prosecution
in
that
kind
of
bank
robbery
would
not
have
to
prove
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
that
there
was
some
monetary
value,
and
the
jury
would
not
have
to
find
it.
we
would
simply
have
to
establish
that
the
robber
had
used
force
within
the
person
or
presence
of
another
to
get
anything
of
value,
and
i
think
we
would
be
able
to
satisfy
the
requisites
of
the
offense
in
a
prosecution
of
that
type.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
well,
it
depends
on--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--justice
souter,
that
is
a
very
difficult
question,
because
the
wording
of
second
paragraph
(b)
is
not
exceeding
1,000
dollars,
so
you
know,
the
question
is,
what
does
that
mean?
our
position
is
that
the
offenses--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--we
construe
the
provision
to
be
property
that
is
subject
to
some
kind
of
monetary
valuation.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
it
could
certainly
have
done
that,
justice
souter.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
absolutely,
and
i
would
like
to
make
one
other
point
about
this
statute
in
that
regard,
that
in
the
subsections
(d)
and
(e)
congress
did
use
very
similar
language
to
make
clear
that
(a)
and
(b)
were
lesser-included
offenses
of
aggravated
robbery
where
the
person
had
been
assaulted
or
there
had
been
a
death
ensuing.
and
the
way
congress
worded
that
made
it
clear
from
the
very
first
provision
of
the
bank
robbery
statute
in
1934
there
was
a
lesser-included
offense
for
simple
bank
robbery
versus
aggravated
bank
robbery.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
no.
the
point
is
that
congress
did
not
intend
to
make
bank
larceny
a
lesser-included
offense
of
bank
robbery,
and
we
know
that
from
the
various
textual
indications
in
the
statute.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
well,
no,
because--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--i
don't
think
congress
could
get
around
that,
justice
souter--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--because
the
prosecution
would
still
have
to
prove
all
of
the
elements.
it
would
simply
have
to
prove
the
additional
element.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
that's
right.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
yes,
or
saying
we
incorporate
this
subsection
in
all
of
the
elements.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
because
the
elements--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--well,
i
think
congress
can
do
that,
but
the
way
it
would
have
to
do
that
would
be
by
reference
to
the
prior
offense,
or
the
greater
offense,
and
taking
out
a
subset
that
would
not
have
to
be
proved.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
at
common
law
the
phrase
was,
force
or
putting
in
fear.
it's
broader
in
this
by
including
force
and
violence
or
by
intimidation,
which
is
not...
is
close
to
putting
in
fear,
but
we
would
submit
not
of
the
same
degree
of
magnitude
in
terms
of
force,
that
there
is
no
intent
to--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--i
think
they
meant
for--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--i
think
they
meant
for
it
to
be
easier
to
establish.
here,
in
this
case,
for
instance,
it
was
an
intimidation
theory,
where
the
defendant
in
this
case
went
to
the
teller,
in
one
case
used
a
sign
saying,
hold-up,
and
frightened
the
teller.
it--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--well,
let
me
move
to
another
one--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--that
may
be
more
persuasive
to
you.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
that's
correct.
let's
start
with
property.
at
common
law
it
had
to
be
personal,
tangible
property
that
was
taken.
under
this
statute,
there
is
no
such
limitation.
it's
any
property
or
money
or
any
other
thing
of
value.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
at
common
law,
it
had
to
be
property
of
another.
under
this
statute,
it
is
belonging
to
or
in
the
care,
custody,
control,
management,
or
possession
of
any
bank,
credit
union,
or
savings
and
loan
institution.
it's
a
broader--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--that's
correct.
robbery
of
your
own
money
would
still
be
robbery
under
this
statute.
as
we've
pointed
out,
there's
no
carrying
away
requirement,
and
there
is
no
intent
to
deprive
permanently
of
property,
so--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--justice
scalia,
i
would
not
want
to
concede
that
for
purposes
of
this
argument
we
would
be
taking--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--the
view
that
criminal
offenses
should
be
construed
by
courts
to
have
common
law
concepts
reinserted
without
some
very
clear
indication
that
congress
intended
to
do
that.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
yes.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
no,
except
for
the
words
of
the
statute,
which
suggest
that
congress
wanted
to
deal
with
people
who
forcefully
took
property
from
the
person
or
presence
of
another
in
a
way
that
would
be
deemed
in,
i
think,
unsocial
behavior,
and
that
is
the
essence
of
our
theory
that
robbery
is
fundamentally
different
because
of
the
means
the
person
uses
to
take
the
property.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
yes.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
yes.
i
think
that--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--yes.
i
do
think
that
the
court
has
to
do
what
it
can
to
infer
congressional
intent,
and
the
position
that
you've
articulated
is
by
far
the
most
difficult--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--hypothetical
under
this
statute.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
well,
in
some
instances
it
is
clear
that
congress
has
intended
to
do
that.
in
other
instances,
it
is
less
clear.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
well,
this
is
one
where
congress
did,
we
submit,
think
about
the
overall
concept
of
lesser-included
offenses,
because
it
made
aggravated
robbery
a
greater
offense
of
simple
robbery.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
what
we
know
is
that
the
act
that
they
all
voted
on
did
not
have
the
word
feloniously
in
it,
and--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--the
omission--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--it
is,
and
the
court
dealt
with
that
in
gaddis
by
saying
that
it
functionally
was
to
be
construed
that
the
person...
if
the
property
had
been
stolen
through
a
robbery,
that
intent
requirement
is
what
had
to
be
established
there
even
though
the
word
a)
doesn't
appear
in
the
subsection
(c)--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--well,
as
to
who
it
helps
more,
it's
six
of
one,
half-dozen
of
the
other,
because
(c)
also
includes
a
special
mental
element
indicating
that
congress
knew
how
to
put
special
mental
elements
in
these
provisions
when
it
wanted
to,
and
it
did
not
do
that
for
the
robbery
provision.
so...
gaddis
also
says
that
(c)
is
not
a
lesser
offense
of
(a)
and
(b),
that
it
is
a
distinct
offense
because
of
the
different
elements
that
were
required
to
be
proved
for
that.
now,
i
would
like
to
make
one
final
point
before
closing,
and
that
is
that
a
number
of
courts
of
appeals,
in
addressing
the
question
of
intent
under
this
statute,
have
faced
claims
by
defendants
that
they
lacked
the
requisite
intent
to
commit
bank
robbery
either
because
they
were
involuntarily
intoxicated
or
they
were
on
lsd,
or
they
had
psychic
problems,
or
some
other
nature
that
would
negate
the
specific
intent
that
they
thought
had
to
be
proved
under
the
provision.
an
argument
that
robbery
has
such
a
special
mens
rea
raises
the
specter
that
defendants
will
attempt
to
negate
that
element
of
intent.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
yes.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
that's
correct.
the
1934
act
was
whoever
by
force
and
violence,
or
by
putting
in
fear,
feloniously
takes,
or
feloniously
attempts
to
take
from
the
person
or
presence
of
another
any
property
or
money
or
any
other
thing
of
value
belonging
to
or
in
the
care,
custody,
control,
management,
or
possession
of
any
bank,
and
the
subse...
i
mean,
that
core
language
has
basically
stayed
with
the
provision
from
1934
to
the
present
day.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
we
would
submit
that
the
decision
should
be
affirmed.
