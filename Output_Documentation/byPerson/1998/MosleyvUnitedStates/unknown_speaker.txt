unknown
speaker
just
a
moment,
mr.
mccauley.
spectators
are
admonished,
do
not
talk
until
you
get
out
of
the
courtroom.
the
court
remains
in
session.
proceed,
mr.
mccauley.
unknown
speaker
there,
the
statute
itself
had
no
intent
requirement,
did
it,
in
morissette,
statute
by
its
terms.
unknown
speaker
what
we're
talking
about
here,
i
guess
the
question
presented
is
whether
bank
larceny
is
a
lesser-included
offense
of
bank
robbery,
is
that
right?
unknown
speaker
and
the
reason
that
intent
is
important,
and
that's
why
you're
talking
about
it,
is
what?
unknown
speaker
and
if
intent
is
read
into
it,
then
it...
bank
larceny
is
a
lesser-included
offense,
and
if
intent
is
not
read
into
the
robbery
statute,
then
bank
larceny
is
not
a
lesser-included
offense?
unknown
speaker
well,
even
if
that
is
so,
don't
you
have
a
problem
in
this
case,
because
the
lesser-included
offense
that
you
ask
the
charge
to
be
given
on
was
the
more
serious
of
the
two
larceny
offenses,
i.e.,
theft
of
something
more
than
1,000,
and
there's
no
requirement
of
value
of
more
than
1,000
in
the
robbery
statute,
so
is
it
not...
i
guess
another
way
to
put
my
question
is,
is
it
not
the
case
that
if
you're
right
so
far,
the
lesser
of
the
two
larceny
statutes
may
be
a
lesser-included
offense,
but
the
one
you
asked
for,
which
requires
proof
of
more
than
1,000,
is
not?
unknown
speaker
well,
why
isn't
it?
it
is,
as
you
just
said,
in
a
separate
paragraph.
that's
not
usually
the
way
sentencing
elements
are
described.
unknown
speaker
mm-hmm.
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
the
test
is
not
whether
this
is
lesser-included
within
the
meaning
of
the
indictment
as
it
charged
the
crime
in
fact.
it's...
the
test
is
a
reference
to
the
statutory
elements
and,
if
that's
the
test,
then
an
element
of
more
than
1,000
dollars,
it
seems
to
me,
defeats
your
case.
unknown
speaker
but
if
we
take
the
position
that
it
is
a
requisite
element,
that's
the
end
of
your
case,
right?
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
there's
nothing
about
1,000
dollars.
if
i
steal...
if
i
rob
the
bank
teller
of
1
dollar,
i've
committed
the
robbery
offense.
i've
not
committed
the
1,000
dollar
larceny
offense.
unknown
speaker
i
take
it
you
think
the
1,000
dollars
is
simply
an
amount
that
triggers
different
punishment
levels.
unknown
speaker
well,
you
said
in
your
brief
that
the
model
instructions
for
this
crime
also
support
your
position,
but
those
model
instructions
tell
the
jury
first
to
find
whether
there's
been
larceny,
and
then
if
they
do
find
it,
the
jury
finds
whether
there's
been
1,000
dollars
or
more
of
value
involved.
it
goes
to
the
jury,
doesn't
it,
under
those
model
instructions
that
you
cite?
unknown
speaker
well,
why
would
it
go
to
the
jury
if
it's
just
a
sentencing
factor?
unknown
speaker
why
would
it
go
to
the
jury
even
if
it's
being
litigated?
why
wouldn't
it
be
a
matter
for
the
judge?
unknown
speaker
when
there's
evidence
issues
on
a
sentencing
factor,
it
goes
to
the
jury?
unknown
speaker
under
those
model
instructions
the
question
of
1,000
dollars
goes
to
the
jury
i
think
because
it's
a
separate
crime.
the
third
circuit
dealt
with
this
question.
what
did
they
say
about
it?
they
dealt
with
the
amount.
unknown
speaker
mr.
mccauley,
i
know
you
didn't
intend
this,
but
when
you
set
forth
section
2113
on
page
2
of
your
brief
i
find
it
misleading.
it
shows
subsection
(b)
as
containing
only
one
paragraph,
whereas
in
fact,
as
shown
in
the
government's...
the
appendix
to
the
government's
brief,
page
2a
of
the
appendix,
subsection
(b)
contains
two
separate
paragraphs,
one
of
which
is
the
1,000
dollars,
and
the
other
one
is
no
value
requirement
at
all,
and
i
think
that
makes
a
big
difference
as
to
whether
you
consider
this
just
a
sentencing
factor
or
a
separate
offense.
unknown
speaker
well
then,
why
didn't
you
set
forth
the
whole
statute
instead
of
just
that
one
paragraph?
unknown
speaker
suppose
the
statute
first
said
that
robbery
must
be
done
with
intent
to
steal
and
to
take
away,
then
2
years
later
the
congress
excises
that
phrase
intent.
what
would
we
take
congress'
purpose
to
be,
just
by
comparing
the
two
statutes?
unknown
speaker
in
other
words,
you
understand
morissette
to
say
that
congress
has
to
say,
we
are
enacting
the
statute
contrary
to
the
common
law
and
the
foregoing
paragraph
is
to
be
interpreted
accordingly?
does
congress
have
to
say
that?
unknown
speaker
well,
but
morissette
didn't...
or
maybe
it
did.
correct
me
if
i'm
wrong...
didn't
involve
the
hypothetical
that
i
put
of
a
statute
which
is
specific,
and
then
a
statute
that's
changed
the
next
year,
not
as
part
of
a
recodification,
just
suppose
that
congress
changes
the
one
specific
statute.
morissette
didn't
involve
that
instance,
did
it?
unknown
speaker
felonious
did.
felonious
did,
but
what...
suppose
the
words
were,
with
intent
to
steal.
same
rule?
unknown
speaker
well--
unknown
speaker
--well,
that
was
an...
that's
an
extraordinary
position
you're
taking,
that
in...
the
statute
at
one
time
says
with
intent
to
steal,
and
congress
passes
a
law
saying,
we
repeal
the
requirement
that
there
be
an
intent
to
steal,
and
you're
saying
in
effect
congress
can't
do
that.
unknown
speaker
so
all
you
need,
then,
is
an
express
repeal
by
congress
of
an
intent
requirement
that
was
formerly
there.
unknown
speaker
but
you
have
that
here.
i
mean--
unknown
speaker
--i
don't
care
about
the
legislative
history.
feloniously
was
there,
and
feloniously
was
repealed.
unknown
speaker
well,
but
then
you
have
to
answer
the
chief
justice's
question
differently,
and
you
have
to
appeal
to
legislative
history
instead
of
simply
asking...
answering
his
question
that
it...
that
you
accept
the
fact
that
if
the
word
is
there,
and
is
then
repealed
by
congress,
the
common
law
requirement
is
eliminated,
because
that
is
the
situation
here.
unknown
speaker
congress
has
to
say
it
in
addition
to
passing
the
statute
that
says
it?
unknown
speaker
you
need
legislative
history
to
confirm
what
the
statue
says,
or
else
the
statute
is
ineffective
to
do
that?
unknown
speaker
that's
an
equally
extraordinary
position,
it
seems
to
me.
you
have
a
situation
where
the
statute
at
one
time
says,
with
intent
to
steal,
and
then
congress
passes
a
law
that
says,
you
know,
enacted
by
congress
and
so
forth,
that
the
words
intent
to
steal
are
hereby
deleted
from
the
statute,
and
there
are
no
committee
reports,
no
legislative
history.
now,
does
that
successfully
get
rid
of
the
intent
to
steal
requirement?
unknown
speaker
well,
it
isn't
a...
it's
not
a
specific
statement.
it's
a
deletion,
and
that,
i
gather,
is
enough.
unknown
speaker
that
is
not
the
situation
here
because
the
legislative
history,
in
your
estimation,
shows
what?
unknown
speaker
we
don't...
as
i
understand
it,
we
wouldn't
necessarily
have
to
go
to
legislative
history
for
that
conclusion,
would
we,
because
i
assume
what
we
would
find,
if
we
went
through
the
codification,
is
that
two
things
happened.
they
took
out
the
word
feloniously
in
all
the
statutes
that
used
to
have
feloniously
in
it,
and
they
simultaneously
enacted
a
new
definitional
section
which
described
as
a
matter
of
definition
what
a
felony
is
and
what
a
misdemeanor
is,
and
i
take
it
we
could
infer
from
that,
without
even
getting
to
legislative
history
explanations,
that
what
they
were
doing,
as
you
said,
was
sort
of
tidying
up.
they
were
taking
out
what
they
thought
were
merely
useless
words
of
classification,
but
nothing
more.
is
that
fair
to
say?
unknown
speaker
they
said
the
words,
lesser
offenses?
unknown
speaker
because
it's
one
thing
to
say
they
filled
a
gap
that
the
bank
robbery
statute
left
open,
and
another
to
say
that
the
way
they
filled
it
was
by
creating
a
lesser-included
offense.
unknown
speaker
but
prince
deals
with
the
merger
of
offenses,
doesn't
it?
it
doesn't
talk
about
the
same
thing
we're
talking
about
here,
lesser-included
offenses.
unknown
speaker
then
what
you're
saying
is
that
the
bank
larceny
statute
is
simply
redundant.
both
statutes
use
the
word
take,
but
the
bank
larceny
statute
goes
on
to
say,
and
carry
away
with
intent
to
steal,
so
i
gather
what
you're
telling
me
now
is
that
the
words,
carry
away
with
intent
to
steal,
are
surplusage,
that
all
it
takes
is
the
word
take.
unknown
speaker
would
the
bank
larceny
statute
be
any
different,
would
it
cover
anything
less,
if
it
simply
read,
takes,
and
left
out
the
words,
carries
away
with
intent
to
steal?
unknown
speaker
all
right,
with
intent
to
steal.
it
just--
unknown
speaker
--if
it
just
said
take--
unknown
speaker
--what
if
it
says,
takes
and
carries
away,
but
does
not
say,
with
intent
to
steal
or
purloin?
unknown
speaker
and
we
wouldn't
read
that
element
in?
unknown
speaker
we
would
not
read
it
in?
we
wouldn't
read
it
into
the
statute?
gee.
but
you're
asking
us
to
do
the
same
thing
to
(a).
unknown
speaker
why
wouldn't
we
do
the
same
thing
to
(b),
if
that
phrase
was
not
in
(b)?
unknown
speaker
gee,
i
really
don't
understand
your
case,
then,
because
i
had
thought
that
your
case
was,
in
describing
common
law
crimes,
congress
is
often
a
little
sloppy,
and
sometimes
they
leave
out
a
word
like
feloniously.
it
doesn't
mean
that
it
wasn't
intended
to
be
there.
they
just
leave
it
out
sometimes.
now
i
ask
you
if
they
left
it
out
in
(b),
would
that
make
any
difference,
but
you
say,
oh,
no,
(b),
if
they
left
it
out
they
would
change
the
crime.
it
would
no
longer
be
the
crime
of
larceny.
why
can't
they
be
elliptical
in
(b)
just
as
you
say
they
have
been
elliptical
in
(a)?
unknown
speaker
now,
i...
oh,
maybe
what
you...
maybe
the
reason
we're
not...
i
don't
mean
that
they
take
it
away
with
the
intent
of
taking
it
away.
they
just
delete
it
from
the
statute.
the
next
time
the
statute
appears,
they
say,
we've
consolidated
statutes,
and
there
are
too
many
words
in
these
statutes.
we're
going
to
take
away
with
intent
to
steal
or
purloin,
okay,
the
same
thing
that
you
say
happened
under
(a),
that
they
just
dropped
feloniously
because
it
was
too
verbose,
or
whatever.
suppose
they
did
the
same
in
(b),
and
they
dropped
with
intent
to
steal
or
purloin.
unknown
speaker
yes.
then
it
would
still
be
larceny,
wouldn't
it?
unknown
speaker
i
thought
your
position
was
that
the
word
takes
does
it
all,
so
why
should
the
word
takes
be
any
different
when
you're
talking
about
larceny
than
a
robbery?
i
thought
you
said
that
the
whole
thing
that
imports
the
idea
of
intent
to
steal
is
the
word
take.
you
said
that
about
the
bank
robbery
statute,
and
now
you're
saying
something
different,
no,
you
need
more
in
the
bank
larceny
statute.
unknown
speaker
but
there's
another--
unknown
speaker
--isn't
there
another
problem,
that
the
criminal
intent
can
be
one
of
two
kinds?
it
can
be
a
general
intent
to
violate
the
law,
which
morissette
says
we
will
always
imply,
or
it
can
be
more
specific,
an
intent
to
deprive
the
person
permanently
of
the
property.
you
could
have
the
former
without
having
the
latter.
unknown
speaker
and
i
think
one
of
the
government's
argument
is
that,
well,
you
have
the
former
in
(a)
but
not
necessarily
the
latter,
and
what
is
your
response
to
that?
unknown
speaker
i
don't
understand
these
words,
specific
intent,
et
cetera,
so
in
my
own
mind
it
comes
down
to
just
what
justice
stevens
said,
that
the
difference,
whether
there's
a
specific
intent
or
not,
from
any
practical
point
of
view,
is
whether
a
person
who
goes
into
a
bank,
puts
out
a
gun,
takes
the
money,
goes
out
of
the
bank,
but
he
did
it
with
an
intent
to
return
the
money,
you
see.
[laughter]
now,
if,
in
fact,
he
still
committed
bank
robbery,
they
win,
but
if,
in
fact,
he
hasn't
committed
bank
robbery,
you
win.
isn't
that
what
it
comes
down
to?
unknown
speaker
yes,
and
if
it
comes
down
to
that,
have
you
found
any
case,
ever,
in
history,
where
there
was
such
a
person,
where
in
fact
he
put
the
gun
up...
i
mean,
we
found
one,
almost,
in
the
sentencing
commission,
where
a
person
who
took
some
money
with
a
toy
gun
to
pay
his
veterinarian
and...
because
he
wanted
the
dog
cured,
and
gave
back
the
money
when
the
dog
died,
i
mean,
but
that
was...
that
was
an
unusual
case,
and
i'm
not
sure
it
applies.
so
i
take
it
we're
talking
about
very
unusual
cases.
you've
both
done
research.
i
will
ask
both
sides
the
same
question.
has
any
case
that
sheds
any
light
on
that
particular
question,
rather
than
using
these
vague
words,
ever
come
up?
unknown
speaker
i
don't
want
to
use
words
like
intent.
what
i
want
to
know
is,
has
there
ever
been
a
case
one
way
or
the
other
where
a
person
who
did
all
these
things
for
bank
robbery,
and
he
walked
out
the
door,
but
he
intended
to
give
the
money
back.
in
that
sense
there's
proof
he
was
going
to
give
the
money
back.
he
was
just
going
to
walk
around
the
block
with
it
and
give
it
back,
or
the
equivalent.
now,
that's
what
you
say
the
case
turns
on,
and
i
agree
with
you.
now,
has
there
ever
been
such
a
case,
or
the
equivalent?
unknown
speaker
no,
no,
there
could
be.
the
government
or
the
state
could
have
prosecuted
somebody
for
that
as
robbery,
and
the
judge
would
have
had
to
decide,
yes
or
no,
is
it
a
robbery.
that
could
have
happened
in
the
history
of
the
50
states,
and
common
law
and,
i
don't
know,
everything
else,
or
statutes
like
this
could
have
happened.
unknown
speaker
i
think
i
recall
a
case
in
which
somebody
walked
in
and
was
under
the
impression
that
money
that
was
in
the
hands
of
a
teller
belonged
to
him,
rather
than
to
the
bank.
that's
another
instance.
and
he
snatched
the
money
violently
out
of
the
hands
of
the
teller,
and
said,
give
me
that,
that's
mine,
and
without
the
feloniously
portion
of
this
statute,
that
would
have
been
a
crime.
i
don't
remember
where
that
case
is.
oh,
no,
but
that's
the
other
possibility.
i
didn't--
--i
don't
know
any
such
case,
but
it's
very
possible
for
such
a
case
to
exist.
didn't
the
tenth
circuit
in
this
case
mention
that
as
one
possibility?
unknown
speaker
in
the
brittain
case,
the
tenth
circuit...
the
tenth
circuit
gave
two
examples
that
seemed
rather
far
out.
one
was,
it
was...
i
thought
it
was
my
money
that
i
was
grabbing,
and
the
other
was,
i
really
want
to
be
put
back
in
prison,
so
i
actually
intimidated
the
teller
to
give
me
the
money,
and
i
looked
for
the
cops
when
i
got
out
on
the
street
so
i
could
be
caught
and
be
put
back
in
prison.
unknown
speaker
i
don't
understand
that.
i
don't
understand
why
that,
adding
that
it
has
to
be
in
the
care,
custody,
or
control
of
the
bank
eliminates
the
requirement
that
you
intend
to
steal,
rather
than
intend
to
get
your
own
money
back,
even
though
it
is
in
the--
unknown
speaker
--no,
i--
unknown
speaker
--no,
it
isn't
really
his
money.
he
thought
it
was
his
money.
unknown
speaker
i'd
like
to
ask
you,
if
i
could,
about
section...
subsection
(c),
which
is
at
page
2a
of
the
petition
in
the
government's
brief.
the
receiver
of
stolen
property
is
guilty
only
if
it's
been
stolen...
only
if
there's
been
a
larceny
under
(b).
unknown
speaker
not
under
(a).
unknown
speaker
which
way
does
that
cut?
does
that
distinction
help
you,
or
does
it
help
the
government?
unknown
speaker
that
doesn't
help
me
much,
but--
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
no,
but
on
the
other
hand,
it
seems
to
me
to
help
the
government
in
that
the
statute
seems
to
envisage
a
situation
in
which
property
has
not...
in
which
there
has
been
a
robbery,
but
property
has
not
been
stolen,
and
that,
it
seems
to
me,
helps
the
government.
unknown
speaker
thank
you,
mr.
mccauley.
mr.
frederick,
we'll
hear
from
you.
unknown
speaker
well,
it
might
be
if
we
read
in
the
intent
to
steal
requirement.
unknown
speaker
well,
you
say
the
take
and
carry,
but
robbery
requires
taking
from,
and
that's
close
enough
for
government
work,
as
they--
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
on
that
point,
then,
suppose
the
scenario
is,
somebody
grabs
10,000
dollars
from
the
bank,
they
didn't
use
any
force
or
intimidation,
and
they
start
walking
away.
they're
stopped
at
the
door
by
the
guard,
so
they
didn't
get
away
from
the
bank.
no
bank
larceny.
unknown
speaker
i'm
asking
about
this
statute.
this
bank
larceny
statute.
i'm
in
the
bank,
i
grab
10,000
dollars,
intending
to
make
it
my
own,
but
i'm
apprehended
at
the
door
before
i
cross
the
threshold,
and
get
outside
the
bank.
unknown
speaker
so
as
soon
as
he
takes
one
step,
he's
carrying
it
away.
unknown
speaker
this
is
a
finely
crafted
statute.
you're
guilty
of
that
offense
if
you
take
a
step,
and
you're
not
guilty
of
it
if
you
don't
take
a
step.
it
seems
very
strange.
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
here
we
just
want
to
know
if
this
particular
statute
is
a
lesser-included
offense
of
the
bank
robbery,
so
you're
telling
me
that
the
difference
between
the
two
is
one
step.
you
don't
have
to
take
any
step
in
robbery
as
long
as
you
used
intimidation
or
force,
but
you
do
have
to
take
one
step--
unknown
speaker
--no,
finish
your
answer.
unknown
speaker
was
it
ever
an
element
of
the
robbery
offense
at
common
law?
unknown
speaker
so
therefore,
even
on
your
position,
even
before
the
word
feloniously
was
eliminated
that
still
was
not
an
element,
and
there
was
never
this
identity.
unknown
speaker
when
feloniously
was
removed
from
the
statute,
assuming
it
did
nothing
more
than
have
this
tidying
up,
or
classifying
a
function,
it
did
not...
it
would
be
easier,
i
guess,
to
go
back
to
my
original
question.
before
feloniously
was
removed
from
the
statute,
the
federal
robbery
statute
never
required
an
asportation
because
in
your
view
that
was
not
a
requirement
of
common
law
and
would
not
have
been
read
into
it
under
the
words
feloniously
or
in
any
other
way,
is
that
correct?
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
no,
i...
you've
answered
my
question.
you
have
said,
it
was
a
requirement
at
common
law,
but
it
was
not
comprehended
by
the
word
feloniously.
it
had
to
be
spelled
out
in
the
statute.
it
was
never
spelled
out
in
this
statute,
and
therefore
the
removal
of
feloniously
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
requirement
under
the
federal
statute.
unknown
speaker
but
if
you
define
an...
call
an
offense
robbery,
and
you
define
it,
and
suppose
you
left
out
carry
away,
i
thought
under
morissette
and
our
jurisprudence
that
we
would
assume
that
the
traditional
asportation
requirement
was
not
eliminated
simply
by
the
failure
to
recite
it.
unknown
speaker
congress
had
not
used
any
words
other
than
knowingly
convert.
unknown
speaker
was
based
on
the
converts.
unknown
speaker
that
footnote
also
says
the
1948
revision
was
not
intended
to
create
new
crimes
but
to
codify
those
then
in
existence.
how
would
you
describe
what
happened
here
in
light
of
that
statement?
unknown
speaker
so
we
do
not
know
whether
it
intended
simply
to
recodify
or,
on
the
other
hand,
whether
it
intended
to
create
new
crimes
with
new
definitions.
we
just
don't
know.
unknown
speaker
wasn't
there
a
general
statement
that
the
whole
revision
was
intended
to
be
a
mere
codification?
unknown
speaker
suppose,
then,
we
said
there
are
two
choices.
choice
1
is
that
congress,
in
putting
the
word
steal
in
the
one
and
not
in
the
other...
it
ended
up
that
way,
didn't
it?
and
robbery
doesn't
have
the
word
intent
to
steal,
larceny
does.
unknown
speaker
one
possibility
is
that's
simply
an
oversight,
or
they
assumed
it
would
be
read
in,
and
the
other
possibility
is
no,
congress
did
it
purposely,
leaving
out
the
words,
intent
to
steal,
or
feloniously,
because
congress
wanted
to
be
sure
that
the
person
in
justice
scalia's
hypothetical
who
unfortunately
is
trying
to
steal
his
own
money,
or
the
person
in
my
hypothetical
who,
in
fact,
takes
it
out
the
door,
walks
around
the
block
and
wants
to
give
it
back,
that
that's
what
congress
wanted
to
do.
congress
wanted
to
punish
those
two
people.
now,
those
seem
to
be
the
only
two
hypotheses
i
can
think
of,
and
it's
obvious
from
the
way
i've
stated
it
that
i
find
the
second
hypothesis
totally
fanciful,
but
perhaps...
i
mean,
there's
never
been
such
a
case,
there
never
will
be
such
a
case,
so
the
notion
that
congress
wanted
to
punish
those
two
cases
which
will
never
occur
is
fanciful.
the
notion
that
it
wanted
to
keep
the
same
requirement,
and
had
nothing
more
in
mind
than
everybody
read
it
in,
is
not
fanciful,
so
what's
your
response
to
that?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
are
there
cases
involving
the
hobbs
act...
there's
none
in
this
court...
in
which
we've
said
that
the
intent
to
steal
does
not...
is
not
included,
but
are
there
cases
in
the
courts
of
appeals?
unknown
speaker
let
me
ask
you,
mr.
frederick,
about
the
common
law
defense
to
the
crime
of
robbery,
and
as
i
understand
it,
or
your
opposite
counsel,
that
it
was
a
defense
if
the
defendant
thought
it
was
his
own
property.
unknown
speaker
but
i
suppose
no
reasonable
defendant
could
think
that
a
bunch
of
dollar
bills
in
a
drawer
in
a
bank
were
his
own
property.
he
might
think
that
he
had
maybe
10
days
earlier
deposited
another
bunch
of
dollar
bills,
but
certainly
he
wouldn't
think
that
the
particular
dollar
bills
that
he
cashier
gave
him
under
the
threat
of
a
gun
were
his
own
property.
unknown
speaker
well,
that
may
be,
but
then
why
does
that
appear
in
(b)?
unknown
speaker
which
also
applies
only
to
money
in
the
possession
of
any
bank,
credit
union,
or
any
savings
and
loan
association,
and
it
specifically
requires
an
intent
to
steal
or
purloin.
unknown
speaker
can
i
ask
a
question
about
the
1,000
dollars,
because
you've
only...
you've
devoted
about
three
or
four
sentences
in
your
brief,
but
it
is
different,
and
the
jury
does
have
to
find,
i
take
it,
the
1,000,
is
that
right?
unknown
speaker
all
right.
but
if
we
say...
i
don't
know
how
to
deal
with
that.
that
is,
it
would
seem
to
me
that
if
that's
what
makes
the
difference,
then
in
instances
where
congress
could
really
want
a
lesser-included
offense...
say,
(b)
is
lesser-included
of
(a),
let's
say.
and
then
it
takes
(b)
and
it
divides
it
into
two
or
three
parts,
one
part
being
a
misdemeanor,
another
part
being
a
felony,
another
part
being
a
more
serious
felony,
it
would
turn
out
even
though
congress
wanted
it
to
be
a
less...
a
lesser-included
offense,
you
never
could
get
the
charge,
because
you'd
have
to
pick
(a)
or
(b)
or
(c).
you
see,
you'd
have
to
pick
version
1,
version
2,
or
version
3,
since
one
or
the
other
would
fit
your
case,
and
then
the
fact
that
there
were
these
two
other
versions
would
prevent
you
from
getting
the
charge,
so
i
can't
work
it
out.
unknown
speaker
you're
talking
about
the
first
paragraph
of
(b)?
unknown
speaker
or
the
second
paragraph?
unknown
speaker
that's
true,
but
what
worries
me
is,
imagine
the
other
two
elements
are
out
of
the
case.
suppose
congress
wrote
(b)...
you
know,
both
parts
of
it,
both
parts
of
the
bank
larceny
statute
in
identical
words
to
(a),
so
robbery,
absolutely
identical
but
for
the
force
or
violence.
and
now
what
it
does
is,
instead
of
having
one
provision
saying
that,
it
has
two
provisions
saying
it,
distinguished
only
by
the
1,000
dollars.
all
that
congress
wanted
to
do
there
is
make
it
a
felony
or
make
it
a
misdemeanor,
but
the
felon
couldn't
get...
you
see,
then
no
one
could
get
the
lesser-included
charge
simply
because
of
that
fact.
that
can't
be
right,
but
i
don't
know
why
it
isn't
right.
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
when
you
do
that,
what
you
have
done
is
to
prove
the
misdemeanor
variety.
you
have
proved
that
there
is
some
value,
but
you
have
not
proved
that
the
value
is
over
1,000
dollars,
so
you've
got
a
simple
lesser-included
in
that
case.
unknown
speaker
isn't
it...
i'm--
unknown
speaker
--well,
it
means...
since
you
have
the
burden
of
proof,
it
means
anything
that
you
have
proven...
anything
that
you
have
not
proven
to
have
a
value
exceeding
a
1,000.
unknown
speaker
why
isn't
the
better
answer
to
the
problem...
i
mean,
we
all
have
it.
justice
breyer
articulated
it,
but
i
mean,
this
strikes
us
all
as
odd.
but
why
isn't
the
answer
to
it,
congress
could
put
in
a
sentence
and
say
that
in
an
indictment
that
charges
property
of
value
exceeding
1,000
dollars...
i'm
sorry,
that
in
an
indictment
for
robbery
that
does
not
specify
value,
that
depending
on...
that
either
of
the
subparagraphs
may
be
treated
as
a
lesser-included
offense?
unknown
speaker
you
know,
depending
on
the
value
that's
actually
proven
at
trial.
unknown
speaker
in
effect
a
special
rule
to
get
around
schmuck
in
cases
like
this.
unknown
speaker
no,
but
if
it
wants
to
there's
a
simple
way
to
do
it.
unknown
speaker
without
getting
into
a
schmuck
elements
problem.
that's
all
i'm
saying.
unknown
speaker
why?
unknown
speaker
you
mean,
you
can't
make
it
a
lesser-included
unless
it
is
a
lesser-included.
unknown
speaker
you
can
only
make
it
a
lesser-included
by
defining
the
elements
in
such
a
way
that
it
is.
unknown
speaker
why
is
that
so?
unknown
speaker
why
can't
congress
say,
we're
going
to
treat
this
as
if
it
were
a
lesser-included,
depending
on
the
proof
that
is
adduced
at
trial?
why
can't
congress
do
that?
unknown
speaker
well,
if
that--
--mr.
frederick,
you've
said
that
(a)
is
not
a
statute
that
uses
common
law
terms,
that
there
are
a
lot
of
things
in
the
first
paragraph
of
(a)
which
are
not
common
law
robbery
terms.
what
in
particular,
by
force
and
violence?
isn't
that
the
standard
requirement?
unknown
speaker
gee,
i
don't
think
that's
very
much
difference.
do
you
think
they
meant
something
different
by
saying
by
force
and
violence,
or
by
intimidation
they
meant
something
different
than
by--
unknown
speaker
--force
or
putting
in
fear?
unknown
speaker
now,
that
is
to
say,
put
the
teller
in
fear.
i
think
you
intimidate
somebody
if
you
put
them
in
fear.
i
don't--
unknown
speaker
--yes,
try--
unknown
speaker
--what
else
is
there?
i
mean,
i
understand
the
later
portion,
or
obtains,
or
attempts
to
obtain
by
extortion.
well,
that's
fine,
but
that's
a
different
section
of
it.
that's
not
the
robbery
section,
i
wouldn't
say.
unknown
speaker
uh-huh.
unknown
speaker
even,
presumably,
if
it's
your
own
money,
yes.
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
they
could
have
been
left
out,
because
you
acknowledge
that
sometimes
in
the
federal
context,
even
in
the
state
context,
some
of
the
elements,
when
a
crime
is
defined,
are
left
out,
but
without
the
intention
of
not
requiring
them.
unknown
speaker
okay.
unknown
speaker
fair
enough.
in
other
words,
if
you
know
that
the
bank
robber...
sorry,
the
bank
robber
knows
that
the
money
on
the
counter
belongs
to
him,
the
bank
robber.
in
fact,
he's
not
a
bank
robber.
he's
just
an
irate
customer,
and
he
gets
so
angry
at
the
delay
that
that
money
that
he
knows
is
his,
he
threatens
to
punch
the
teller
in
the
nose.
i
guess
that
could
happen.
the
teller's
taking
a
long
time.
in
your
view,
congress
intended
to
punish
that
as
bank
robbery?
unknown
speaker
yes.
is
there
any
indication
anywhere
that
congress
wanted
to
punish
that
as
bank
robbery?
unknown
speaker
but
let
me
ask
you,
i'm
still...
i'm
still
not
totally...
i...
and
you
might
be
helpful
on
this.
if...
remember,
i'm
imagining
that
all
your
arguments
are
out
of
this
case.
it
is
written
identically,
the
larceny,
to
the
robbery
ones,
and
none
of
your
arguments
are
there
but
for
the
force
or
violence,
but
for
the
1,000
dollars.
i'm
still...
and
you
agree,
i
take
it,
or
don't
you,
that
if
congress
had
wanted,
in
(a)
it
has
bank
robbery,
in
(b)
and
(c)
it
has
bank
larceny,
identically
worded
but
for
force
in
(a)
and
but
for
1,000
dollars
in
(b)
and
nothing
in
(c).
all
right.
now,
do
you
think
congress
could
have
said,
and
by
the
way,
being
a
little
informal,
we
want
(b)
and
(c)
to
be
lesser-included
offenses
of
(a)?
it
could
have
said
that.
unknown
speaker
and
if
it
had
said
that,
they'd
be
entitled
to
the
charge.
unknown
speaker
all
right.
then
my
question
is,
given
a
federal
criminal
code
with
4,000
sections,
or
3,800,
having
been
written
at
different
periods
with
different
drafting
styles,
with
different
understandings
of
law,
don't
we
have
to
try
to
figure
out
whether
congress
implicitly
wanted
to
do
that,
rather
than
looking
for
some
actual
form
of
words
in
(a)
that
would
tell
us?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
that
congress
gives
a
lot
of
intent
in
drafting
statutes
as
to
whether
one
is
a
lesser-included
offense
than
the
other?
unknown
speaker
you
say
this
is
not
one
of
them.
unknown
speaker
really?
do
you
really
think
that
a
majority
of
the
members
of
congress
even
knew
that
the
word
feloniously
had
been
dropped
from
this
provision,
much
less
had
a
particular
intent
as
to
what
the
dropping
of
it
meant?
do
you
really
think
that?
unknown
speaker
it
seems
to
me...
i
have
one
question
under
(c)
again.
under
your
view,
if
there's
been
a
robbery
under
(a),
then
there
can
be
no
receiving
stolen
property
under
(c)
without
your
going
ahead
and
showing
that
the
elements
of
larceny
were
really
there
anyway.
that
seems
to
me
a
little
odd.
unknown
speaker
i
mean,
you're
going
to
have
robberies
under
(a)
that
you
prosecute
under
(a),
but
then
you
have
people
who
receive
stolen
property
and
you're
going
to
have
to
show
there's
a
(b)
offense.
that
seems
to
me
a
strange
way
to
operate.
unknown
speaker
and
to
that
extent
it
seems
to
me,
even
given
gaddis,
that
the
(c)
problem
helps
the
petitioner
more
than
you.
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
you
one
historical
question?
you
mentioned
some
elements
of
this
offense
that
differ
from
common
law
robbery
such
as
the
care,
custody,
and
control
of
the
bank
and
so
forth.
were
those
elements
in
the
statute
before
1948?
unknown
speaker
so
if...
so
they
don't
show
that
the
'48
revision
made
a
change.
they
are
not
evidence
of
the
'48
codification
changing
the
meaning
of
the
statute.
unknown
speaker
the
honorable
court
is
now
adjourned
until
monday
next
at
ten
o'clock.
