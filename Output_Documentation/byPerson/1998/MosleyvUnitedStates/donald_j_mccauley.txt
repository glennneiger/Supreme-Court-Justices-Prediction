mr.
donald
j.
mccauley
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
issue
in
this
case--
mr.
donald
j.
mccauley
--the
issue
in
this
case
is,
if
this
court
is
to
imply
a
mens
rea
element
in
the
federal
bank
robbery
statute,
as
both
sides
concede
it
must,
then
the
court's
decision
in
morissette
v.
the
united
states
governs.
in
morissette
v.
the
united
states,
the
court
held
that
it
would
imply
a
specific
intent
element
into
a
statute
that
codified
a
common
law
crime.
mr.
donald
j.
mccauley
that's
correct,
although
i
believe
there
was
mention
of
a
knowingly
in
the
morissette
case,
a
general
intent,
and
this
court
held
that
where
the
legislature,
congress
was
codifying
a
crime
that
was
a
crime
at
common
law,
it
considered
the
whole
tradition
of
the
common
law,
wherein
an
evil
intent
had
always
been
either
a
specific
element
of
the
statute
of
common
law,
or
the
understanding
of
the
case
law
common
law,
so
when
the
congress
was
legislating
against
that
common
law
backdrop,
this
court
held
a
statute
that
did
not
have
the
literal
word
intent,
or
evil
will,
that
was
not
deleted
by
congress
through
inadvertence,
that
the
court
would
require
a
specific
statutory
statement
by
the
congress
saying
that
it
intended
and
directing
that
its
intention
was
contrary
to
the
common
law
understanding
that
an
evil
intent
was
always
there.
mr.
donald
j.
mccauley
yes.
mr.
donald
j.
mccauley
is
the
larceny
statute
specifically
has
an
element,
intent
to
steal,
whereas
the
current
codification
of
the
bank
robbery
statute
does
not
have
the
word
intent.
it
has
the
steal
language
in
that
there's
a
phrase,
to
take
from
the
person
or
presence
of
another,
which
is
the
definitional
term
for
steal.
mr.
donald
j.
mccauley
yes,
your
honor,
under
this
court's
holding
in
schmuck.
if
it
is
read
in,
and
we
have
the
definitional
phrase
connoting
steal,
then
it
mirrors
the
elements
that
are
at
issue
in
the
lesser
offense,
the
intent
to
steal.
mr.
donald
j.
mccauley
no,
justice
souter.
the
1,000
threshold
that's
in
the
two
paragraphs
of
the
larceny
statute
is
not
a
requisite
element
of
larceny.
mr.
donald
j.
mccauley
i
submit
that
the
1,000
threshold
is
to
distinguish
between
a
felony
larceny,
felony
bank
larceny--
mr.
donald
j.
mccauley
--and
a
misdemeanor
bank
larceny.
now,
the
crime
of
robbery
is
always
a
felony,
and
we
were
charged
in
the
indictment
with
a
crime
of
robbery,
and
the
indictment
set
forth
amounts
more
than
1,000,
9,000
in
count
1--
mr.
donald
j.
mccauley
--that's
why
it
is
our
position,
and
we
urge
the
court,
that
the
1,000
dollars
mentioned
in
the
two
paragraphs
of
the
larceny
statute
is
not
a
requisite
element.
mr.
donald
j.
mccauley
i
don't
believe
so,
because
there's
language
in
the
robbery
statute
regarding
monetary
value.
mr.
donald
j.
mccauley
no.
you
would
have
committed
the
misdemeanor
larceny
offense.
mr.
donald
j.
mccauley
yes,
and
i
think
it's
illustrated
by
the
indictment
requirement,
the
fifth
amendment
right
to
indictment,
where
any
felony
we're
entitled
to
a
right
to
an
indictment,
where
you
wouldn't
be
entitled
to
a
right
to
an
indictment
on
a
misdemeanor
larceny.
mr.
donald
j.
mccauley
yes.
if
that
is--
mr.
donald
j.
mccauley
--only
if
that
issue
is
being
litigated.
mr.
donald
j.
mccauley
if
there
were...
if
there
was
evidence
issues
regarding
the
exact
amount
of
the
money
the
triggers--
mr.
donald
j.
mccauley
--no.
if
there
were,
under
a
particular
scenario,
evidence
to
support
either--
mr.
donald
j.
mccauley
--in
a
footnote,
they
said
this
is
not
an
element.
they
said
it
had...
it
was
not
a
requisite
element,
that
common
law,
congress
did
not
when
it
legislated
consider
this
a
requisite
element,
when
it
took
the
common
law
terms
and
laid
them
out
in
what
is
a
larceny.
mr.
donald
j.
mccauley
oh,
it
is
a
critical
difference.
mr.
donald
j.
mccauley
well,
we
apologize
if
that...
we
did
not
believe
that
that
was
at
issue,
that
the
third
circuit,
the
court
below
dropped
a
footnote,
said
this
is
not
an
element,
it's
clearly
a
distinction
between
felonious...
a
felony
and
a
misdemeanor.
our
understanding
of
the
case
law
was
that
that's
the
reason
for
the
s1,
000.
the
critical
element
that
the
court
below
was
saying
is
missing
from
the
robbery
statute
is
this
intent
to
steal,
and
the
position
is
that
that
has
always
been
in
the
robbery
statute.
the
government
concedes
it
was
a
requisite
element
up
until
1948.
it's
only
with
the
recodification
of
title
xviii
in
1948
that
the
word
intent
in
the
form
of
the
term
felonious
is
deleted,
and
that's
explained
by
this
court
in
the
prince
matter,
that
it
was
just
a
change
in
phraseology,
and
that--
mr.
donald
j.
mccauley
--under
the
court's
holding
in
morissette,
and
reaffirmed
4
years
ago
in
staples
and
x-citement
video,
you
would
require
a
specific
statutory
statement
saying
that
we
are
acting
contrary
to
the
common
law
understandings
of
a
common
law
crime.
mr.
donald
j.
mccauley
yes.
that's
my
understanding
in
morissette
with
respect
to
common
law
crimes,
crimes
that
were
malum
in
se
at
common
law,
not
crimes
that
are
malum
prohibitum.
as
the
morissette
case
says,
if
we
were
dealing
with
just
regulatory
offenses,
it
would
not...
if
this
court,
under
its
holding
in
morissette,
would
not
require
a
specific
contrary
statement
by
congress.
but
the
court
stated
in
the
morissette
opinion
absent
a
specific
statement
to
the
contrary
we
will
imply
this
scienter
requirement,
this
mens
rea,
this
intent,
and
there...
and
i
think
what's
also
illustrating--
mr.
donald
j.
mccauley
--yes.
felonious
had
fallen
out
of
section
641,
the
statute
that
was
interpreted
in
morissette,
and
the
court--
mr.
donald
j.
mccauley
--yes,
the
same
rule,
because
the
court
in
morissette
said,
anything,
these
critical
elements,
whether
they
be
actus
reis
or
mens
reas,
that
had
been
established
in
the
more
important
part
of
criminal
jurisprudence,
they
are
not
changed--
mr.
donald
j.
mccauley
--by
inadvertence.
mr.
donald
j.
mccauley
no.
then
that
is
a
specific
statement
that
the
court
is
looking
for
in
the
morissette
analysis.
mr.
donald
j.
mccauley
yes.
that
is
my
understanding
of
morissette.
mr.
donald
j.
mccauley
no.
the
legislative
history
is
silent
on
that,
and
the
legislative
history--
mr.
donald
j.
mccauley
--and
it
was
explained
in
the
prince
case
as
a
change
in
phraseology
to
tidy
up
the
statutes.
mr.
donald
j.
mccauley
i
understand
the
chief
justice's
question
to
say
if
congress
says
we're
repealing
that,
that
is
a
specific
statement
to
the
contrary--
mr.
donald
j.
mccauley
--a
specific
indication
that
it
is
acting
contrary
to
the
common
law--
mr.
donald
j.
mccauley
--if
you
have
it.
if
you
don't
have
legislative
history,
you
look
at
the
text,
and
you
understand
the
text,
and
if
it's
a
common
law
offense,
the
court's...
under
the
court's
precedents
an
implied...
specific
intent
will
be
implied
in--
mr.
donald
j.
mccauley
--yes.
that's
a
specific
statement
by
the
congress
that
it
is
deleting
that
element
that
has
previously
been
there.
mr.
donald
j.
mccauley
yes,
and
it
is
changing.
it
is
changing
the
requisite
elements.
here,
they're--
mr.
donald
j.
mccauley
--that
felonious
was
deleted
as
a
matter
of
phraseology
to
tidy
up
the
statutes
in
1948
that
had
become
cumbersome
through
the
repeated
use
of
the
term,
felony
and
misdemeanors.
mr.
donald
j.
mccauley
yes,
and
what
they
did
not
delete...
and
in
1937,
that
was
the
first
modification
of
the
original
bank
robbery
statute
that
was
enacted
in
1934.
the
prince
case
explains
and
the
legislative
history
is
not
malleable
on
this.
the
statement
is,
it's
an
act,
the
1937
act
is
an
act
to
include
lesser-included
offenses
of
robbery,
and
it
was
in
response
to
the
justice
department
writing
to
the
congress
saying,
they
had
an
example
where
someone
went
into
the
bank
and
took
the
money,
but
there
was
no
force,
threat,
or
intimidation,
and
they
couldn't
be
prosecuted
under
the
robbery
statute
because
of
the
robbery's
requirement
of
that
extra
element
of
force,
threat,
or
intimidation.
and
the
congress
responded
and
entitled
the
act,
bank
robbery
and
incidental
crimes,
and
their
statement
in
the
legislative
history
specifically
stated,
this
is
an
act
to
amend
the
bank
robbery
statute
to
include
the
lesser
offenses
of
bank
burglary
and
bank
larceny.
mr.
donald
j.
mccauley
yes.
mr.
donald
j.
mccauley
yes.
i
believe
the
statement,
preface
statement
is,
this
is
an
act
to
amend
the
robbery
statute
to
include
the
lesser
offenses.
mr.
donald
j.
mccauley
that's
correct.
the
prince
case
held
that
there
couldn't
be
pyramiding
of
punishments.
if
the
actual
robbery
is
completed,
and
the
person
had
been
indicted
for
the
completed
robbery
and
also
indicted
for
the
unlawful
entry
with
the
intent,
that
the...
those
elements
would
collapse
in
and
there
could
only
be
one
punishment.
the
court
struck
down
the
consecutive
sentences
in
prince.
i
cited
the
prince
case
for
the
explanation
of
what...
how
felonious
does
not
appear
in
the
current
statute,
where
it
always
did
appear
in
the
original
enactment
and
then
in
the
amendment
in
1937,
because
that
is
the
critical
term
that
is
missing.
i
think
what's
also
illustrates
this,
and
it's
the
government's
brief
at
page
11,
when
they
recite
what
they
say
are
the
requisite
elements
of
the
bank
robbery
statute,
they
do
not
recite
the
language,
to
take
from
the
person
or
presence
of
another.
the
definitional
term
of
the
word
steal,
it's
there
in
the
text.
the
government
overlooks
it
in
its
recitation
on
page
11.
it
also
overlooks
it
when
it
draws
this
court's
attention
to
other
robbery
statutes
that
the
congress
has
enacted
on
pages
14
through
15
of
the
government's
brief.
it
deletes
in
their
recitation...
and
it's
included
in
the
whole
appendix,
but
not
when
they
have
it
in
the
body
of
their
brief,
these...
the
critical
definitional
term
for
steal,
to
take
from
the
person
or
presence
of
another.
mr.
donald
j.
mccauley
they
were
used...
at
common
law
the
statutes
had
used
the
word
take,
and
also
carry
away,
as
delineating
various
elements.
it
was
a
requirement
of
asportation,
was
the
term
that
was
used.
there
had
to
be
some
movement.
mr.
donald
j.
mccauley
if
the
carries
away
was
taken
out,
there
wouldn't
be
this
asportation,
of
the
movement--
mr.
donald
j.
mccauley
--of
the
property
with
intent
to
steal.
mr.
donald
j.
mccauley
yes,
and
i
say
the
greater
offense,
robbery,
also
has
this
asportation
requirement
in
the
definition
of
steal,
and
take--
mr.
donald
j.
mccauley
--then
it's
not
a
larceny.
that
was
a
requisite
element
at
common
law.
mr.
donald
j.
mccauley
no,
not
that
actus
reis.
mr.
donald
j.
mccauley
i--
mr.
donald
j.
mccauley
--because
the
evil
intent
was
always
a
critical
element,
the
means
rea
element,
whereas
whatever
actus
reis
may
have
been
required,
but
not--
mr.
donald
j.
mccauley
--i
don't
understand...
if
they
take
out
the
intent
to
steal
element
of
larceny,
my
answer
was
that
then
it
wasn't
a
larceny
by
definition
in
common
law.
mr.
donald
j.
mccauley
and
they
still
labeled
that
bank
larceny.
mr.
donald
j.
mccauley
absent
a
contrary
expression
that
they
were
rewriting
the
common
law,
the
court
could
imply
that
requisite
element.
mr.
donald
j.
mccauley
in
the
bank
robbery
statute,
i'm
relying
on
the
court's
holding
in
morissette
and
its
prodigy
to
put
that
critical
mens
rea
intent
element
in
where
felonious
had
been,
and
felonious
had
modified
the
definitional
term
of
steal.
so
up
until
1948,
we
had
intent
to
take
from
the
person
of
another,
intent
to
steal.
the
element
that
the
court
below
held
as
a
matter
of
law
does
not
appear
in
the
robbery
statute,
and
because
it
doesn't
appear,
the
robbery
statute
doesn't
embrace,
fully
embrace
the
requisite
elements
of
the
larceny
statute.
so
under
schmuck,
as
a
matter
of
law,
it's
not
a
lesser-included
offense.
i
say,
as
a
matter
of
law,
intent
is
there
implicitly,
impliedly
by
the
court's
precedents,
and
that
when
felonious
was
taken
out,
absent
a
specific
congressional
statement
that
they
were
doing
that
intentionally
and
not
by
inadvertence.
they
were
not
looking
to
revolutionize
the
understanding
of
robberies
and
larcenies--
mr.
donald
j.
mccauley
--which
they
recodified
in
1948.
mr.
donald
j.
mccauley
yes.
mr.
donald
j.
mccauley
well,
that
essentially
turns
the
reasoning
of
morissette
on
its
head,
because
morissette
said,
when
we're
dealing
with
statutory
definitions
or
codification
of
common
law
offenses,
we
will
imply
this
evil
mens
rea,
specific
intent.
i
believe
that
is
the
holding
and
the
rationale
in
morissette.
we
would
not
do
it,
we
would
allow
for
a
general
intent
in
other
offenses,
public
welfare
offenses,
regulatory
offenses.
but
where
congress
legislates
in
the
traditional
common
law
area
of
crimes,
absent
a
specific
statement,
it
will
be
the
specific
intent
that
the
court
would
apply.
mr.
donald
j.
mccauley
yes.
mr.
donald
j.
mccauley
the
intent,
in
any
case--
mr.
donald
j.
mccauley
--there
wouldn't
be
a
reported
case
because
i
submit
it's
not
a
robbery,
and
he
may
not
have
been
indicted.
mr.
donald
j.
mccauley
i'm
not
aware
of
a
case
that,
your
honor,
justice
breyer--
mr.
donald
j.
mccauley
--yes.
mr.
donald
j.
mccauley
well,
justice
ginsburg,
with
respect
to
the
first
hypothetical,
that
i
really
thought
it
was
my
money,
that
had
been
a
defense
at
common
law.
under
claim
of
right,
if
a
person
was
recovering
their
own
money
by
force
and
violence,
that
could
defend
and
defeat
the
mens
rea,
the
evil
intent.
however,
congress,
in
drafting
this
language,
and
the
text
of
this
statute,
both
the
larceny
provision
and
the
robbery
provision
has
the
added
language
that
takes
away
that
defense
of
claim
of
right.
the
added
language
is,
the
property
or
money
in
the
care,
custody,
and
control
of
the
bank,
so
irrespective,
the
going
in
and
saying,
give
me
my
money,
if
it's
done
by
force,
threat,
in
the
presence
of
a
person,
it's
a
completed
robbery,
if...
irrespective
if
it's
your
own
money,
because
it's
in
the
care,
custody,
and
control.
so
they
broadened
the
common
law--
mr.
donald
j.
mccauley
--oh,
it
doesn't.
it
doesn't.
my
point
was
that
it
took
away...
that
language
takes
away
the
common
law
defenses,
but
a
defendant
claiming
right
to
the
money,
and
therefore
defeating
the
element
of
intent
to
steal,
because--
mr.
donald
j.
mccauley
--if
the
money
is
in
the
care
of
the
bank--
mr.
donald
j.
mccauley
--then
i
would
say
that's
a
completed
robbery.
mr.
donald
j.
mccauley
yes.
mr.
donald
j.
mccauley
yes.
mr.
donald
j.
mccauley
well,
this
distinction,
i
believe
it
helps
us
both,
because
it
illustrates--
mr.
donald
j.
mccauley
--this
court's
opinion
in
gaddis
interprets
this
statute.
this
is
a
receiving
stolen
property,
and
in
gaddis
it
was
similar
to
the
prince
analogy
of
pyramiding
and
consecutive
sentences,
and
i
think
a
reading
of
the
gaddis
opinion,
which
was
issued
prior
to
the
prince
elements
test,
the
gaddis
opinion
i
think
is
illustrative
and
instructive,
because
i
believe
the
court
in
gaddis
is
assuming
that
2113(b)
is
a
lesser-included
offense
of
2113
(a).
this
enacted
in
(c)--
mr.
donald
j.
mccauley
--well,
why
it's
not
a
lesser-included
offense,
and
i
would
submit
it's
not
a
lesser-included
offense
of
the
robbery,
where
i
submit
(b)
is,
is
because
there's
an
additional
element
and
there's
additional
purpose
behind
the
text,
and
it's
to
go
at
other
individuals,
a
different
class
of
individuals,
receivers
of
property,
and
that's
what
the
gaddis
opinion
explains.
so
that's
an
additional
class
of
people,
a
different
purpose
behind
the
text,
and
a
different
element,
whereas
i
submit
all
of
the
elements
within
the
text--
