mr.
roy
w.
mcleese
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
as
to
the
tax
offenses,
the
district
court
erred
by
failing
to
instruct
the
jury
to
decide
the
materiality
of
petitioner's
understatement
of
his
income
by
5
million.
but
that
error
is
not
comparable
to
the
kinds
of
pervasive
and
fundamental
errors
that
this
court
has
characterized
as
invariably
requiring
reversal,
no
matter
what
the
circumstances
in
all
cases.
and
the
error
was
harmless
here.
because
the
materiality
of
the
petitioner's
understatement
of
his
income
by
5
million
was
both
uncontroverted
and
incontrovertible,
there
is
no
risk
here
that
there
was
an
inaccurate
jury
verdict.
there
is
no
possibility
that
the
jury's
verdict
would
have
been
different
had
the
instructions
been
otherwise.
mr.
roy
w.
mcleese
not--
mr.
roy
w.
mcleese
--not
to
all
elements,
justice
scalia.
mr.
roy
w.
mcleese
it's
difficult
to
imagine
a
case
in
which
more
than
one
element
would
be
omitted
or
misdescribed,
and
each
of
those
omitted--
mr.
roy
w.
mcleese
--no.
i'm
making
the
point--
mr.
roy
w.
mcleese
--so
long
as
those
issues
that
are
contested
and
reasonably
contestable
are
submitted
to
the
jury,
harmless
error
analysis
is
available.
mr.
roy
w.
mcleese
no.
so
long
as--
mr.
roy
w.
mcleese
--no.
so
long
as
those
issues
that
are
contested
in
front
of
the
jury
and
are
reasonably
contestable
are
submitted
to
the
jury,
harmless
error
analysis
is
available.
now,
of
course,
affirmance
will
be
available--
mr.
roy
w.
mcleese
--the
bill
of
rights
requires
that
the
jury
find
guilt
on
all
elements.
and
that
establishes
that
there
was
error
here.
the
question
is...
is
whether
appellate
courts
can
find
such
errors
harmless.
and
you...
it...
it
is
no
more
depriving
defendants
of
their
right
to
jury
trial
for
an
appellate
court
to
say,
had
the
elemental
instructions
been
otherwise,
the
verdicts
would
have
been
the
same,
than
in
the
well-established
situation
where
the
jury
does
not
hear
evidence
that
the
defendant
constitutionally
is
entitled
to
before
the
jury.
there,
the...
the
defendant
had
a
constitutional
right
to
have
the
jury
enter
a
judgment
on
this
evidence
as
well
as
others.
and
what
happens
is
that
the
appellate
court
can't
cure
that
error.
the
jury
did
not
hear
that
evidence.
what
the--
mr.
roy
w.
mcleese
--but
the
finding
of
guilt,
justice
scalia,
is
equally
composed
of
the
legal
information
a
jury
uses
and
the
factual
evidence.
and
if
there
is
an
omission
in
the
one,
as
in
the
other,
there
is
power
in
the
appellate
court
to
find
harmless
error.
and
there
is
no,
i
think,
warrant
to
treat
omissions
of
law...
had
the
jury
heard
this
law,
its
verdict
might
have
been
different...
as
insusceptible
of
harmless
error
review.
but
omissions
of
evidence...
had
the
jury
heard
this
evidence,
its
verdict
would
have
been
the
same
as
available.
mr.
roy
w.
mcleese
i
disagree,
justice
scalia.
mr.
roy
w.
mcleese
i
disagree.
equally,
we
do
not
allow
judges
to
exclude
constitutionally
admissible
evidence.
and
when
judges
do
that,
we
find
error.
but
appellate
courts
have
the
authority,
under
this
court's
cases,
including
van
arsdale,
to
say,
although
the
jury
that
decided
this
case
never
considered
that
evidence,
we
can
make
the
judgment
with
sufficient
confidence
that
any
rational
jury
that
heard
that
evidence
would
have
reached
the
same
verdict
on
the
constitutional
record
that
should
have
been
in
front
of
it
as
the
judgment
that
it
reached
on
the
record
that
was
curtailed
by
omission
that
it
had
in
front
of
it.
and
there
is
no
more
invasion
of
the
power
of
the
jury
in
the
one
setting
than
in
the
other.
mr.
roy
w.
mcleese
i
think,
typically,
in
situation
where
you
had
the
failure
to
report
large
quantities
of
income,
as
here,
and
the
defendant
had
not
contested
it,
the
error
would
be
harmless
under
the
rule
that
we
propose.
mr.
roy
w.
mcleese
i
think,
in
the
setting
where
the
evidence
of
materiality
is
so
overwhelming
and
so
uncontested
that
no
rational
jury
could
reach
a
different
conclusion.
but
that's
a
subset,
a
significant
subset--
mr.
roy
w.
mcleese
--i
think
there
might
well
be
tax...
again,
this
is
not
a
tax
fraud
case.
this
was
a
false
reportment...
reporting
of
income.
and
it
might
well
not
always
be
the
case
that
the
overstatements
would
be
so
great
that
any
rational
juror
would
have
to
conclude
that
the
overstatements
would
be
material.
that...
that
might
be
true
in
some
settings
and
not
in
others.
mr.
roy
w.
mcleese
i...
i
think
we
would
argue
for
that
broader
view
in
a
case
which
required
that
it
be
presented.
i
don't
think
that's
the
inevitable...
inevitable
consequence
of
accepting
the
narrower
view
that
we
press
here.
which
is,
not
only
that
the
evidence
is
so
overwhelming
that
no
rational
juror
could
have
reached
a
different
conclusion,
but,
in
addition,
it's
not
even
reasonably
contested
and
was
not
contested.
so
that
we
know,
for
example,
that
at
a
retrial,
the
issue
at
the
retrial
is
not
going
to
be
whether
these
statements
were
material.
the
issue
at
the
retrial
is
going
to
be
for
the
defendant
to
try
to
get
a
second
opportunity
to...
to
litigate
issues
that
a
properly
instructed
jury
already
resolved
against
it.
and
so,
although
i
think
we
might
well
argue
in
a
case
which
presented
the
issue
for
that
broader
view,
that's...
i
don't
think
that
that's
an
essential
component
of
the
rule
that
we're
pressing
here.
mr.
roy
w.
mcleese
there
is
reasoning
in
sullivan
that
i
think
would
be
inconsistent
with
the
view
that
we
espouse.
i
think
the
court's
subsequent
decisions...
for
example,
in
johnson...
made
clear
that
this
issue
was
left
open.
i
don't
think
we...
the
outcome
in
sullivan
is
entirely
consistent
with
our
submission.
in
sullivan,
the
court
concluded
that
there
was
a...
a
constitutional
error
in
the
reasonable
doubt
instruction
that
provided
the
framework
for
the
entire
trial.
and
it
concluded
in
a
line
of
reasoning
that
is
consistent
with
our
submission--
mr.
roy
w.
mcleese
--no.
no.
i
think
that
the
court
held
that--
mr.
roy
w.
mcleese
--well,
there
were
two
lines
of
reasoning
in
sullivan.
and
one
of
the...
and
one
of
them
is
entirely
consistent
with
our
submission.
and
that
is
that
reasonable
doubt
instructions
are
part
of
the
fundamental
structure
of
the
entire
trial.
and
constitutional
defects
in
that
structure
require
reversal
without
more,
because
the
defendant
has
not
received
the
kind
of
a
trial
that
we
will
insist
upon,
whatever
else
happened
at
the
trial.
that
line
of
reasoning
is
entirely
consistent
with
our
submission.
there
is
a
line
of
reasoning
in
sullivan
which
suggests,
as
petitioner
argues
here,
that
harmless
error
analysis
is
always
unavailable
if
the
jury
did
not
actually
find
what...
all
of
the
elements.
and
our
submission
has
been
that
that
line
of
reasoning
in
sullivan
is
inconsistent
with
other
important
lines
of
this
court's
authority.
it's
inconsistent
with
the
cases--
mr.
roy
w.
mcleese
--well,
i
think
the
problem
in
sullivan
was
not
so
much
that
the
elaboration
of
the
reasonable
doubt
instruction
was
not
affirmatively
helpful.
i
think
the
concern
was
that
it
was
affirmatively
incorrect
and
had
the
effect
of
watering
down
the
concept
of
reasonable
doubt.
mr.
roy
w.
mcleese
so,
i
do
think
that
instructions
which...
which
reasonably
communicate
to
the
jury
that
they
may
convict
on
less
than
reasonable
doubt
on
all
of
the
elements
of
all
of
the
offenses
are
more
fundamental
and
more
pervasive
in
a
way
that
justifies
treating
them
in
the
same
class
as
complete
denials
of
the
right
to
counsel
and
other
errors
that
have
been
treated
as
completely
insusceptible
to
harmless
error--
mr.
roy
w.
mcleese
--i
think
he
will
try.
i
completely
agree.
and
if
the...
the
question
suggests
the
appropriateness
of
moving
to
the
second
issue,
i'm
happy
to
shift
to
that
topic.
mr.
roy
w.
mcleese
i
don't
think...
the
reason
that
an
incorrect
charge
was
given
here
was
because
the
stated
case
was
tried
before
this
court's
decision
in
gaudin--
mr.
roy
w.
mcleese
--suggested
that
materiality
was
in
fact--
mr.
roy
w.
mcleese
--prospectively,
in
this
setting,
no.
however,
because,
as
petitioner
acknowledges,
the
logic
of
his
view
applies
equally
to
any
incorrect
description
of
the
elements
of
any
of
the
offenses
in
the
federal
code,
i
think
a
rule
that
treats
all
of
those
as
insusceptible--
mr.
roy
w.
mcleese
--i
had
understood
him
to
answer
justice
scalia's
question
by
indicating
that
it
made
no
difference
to
him
which
of
those
things
you
properly
characterize
an
error
as.
and
i
think
it's...
it's
ultimately
impossible--
mr.
roy
w.
mcleese
--and
i
think
it's
ultimately
impossible...
as
justice
breyer's
question
suggested,
it's
ultimately
an
impossible
inquiry.
i
don't
think
there's
any
well-defined
distinction
that
you
can
get
a
hold
of.
so,
i
don't
understand
him
to
be
proposing
such
a
view.
and
i
think
that,
because
the
logic
of
his
view
does
expand
so
widely...
i
think,
therefore,
the
logic
of
his
view
does
expand
widely.
if
i
could
turn
to
the...
the
materiality
issue
with
respect
to
the
fraud
count.
under
the
instructions
that
were
given
to
it,
the
jury
could
find
petitioner
guilty
on
the
fraud
counts
only
if
it
found
that
he
intended,
by
means
of
deception,
to
obtain
money
or
property
from
others.
that
means
that
the
jury
necessarily
concluded
here
that
petitioner
subjectively
intended
that
his
deceptions
be
effective
in...
in
causing
the
victims
to
transfer
their
property
or
money
over
to
him.
in
other
words,
put
a
different
way,
the
instructions
essentially
required...
you
might
call
it
subjective
materiality.
he
planned
and
hoped
and
intended
that
they
would
be
material.
he
wanted
them
to
be
effective
as
operating
on
his
victims,
to
cause
his
victims
to
give
him
their
property
and
money.
the
petitioner's
claim
is
that
more
is
required
under
the
statute.
and
the
more
that
is
required
is
that
not
only
does
he
have
to
intend
that
they
have
that
characteristic,
but
that
in
fact
they
have
that
characteristic.
and
the
wording
of
the
statute
is
to
the
contrary.
what
the
statute
punishes
is
schemes
and
artifices
to
defraud.
and
not
merely
that,
but
even
defendants
who
intend
to
devise
a
scheme
or
artifice
to
defraud.
and
as
this
court
said
in
durland
when
it
first
interpreted
that
provision,
that
language
makes
clear
that
the
significant
fact
is
the
defendant's
intent
and
purpose.
a
defendant
who--
mr.
roy
w.
mcleese
--and
there's
a
sense--
mr.
roy
w.
mcleese
--and...
and
there
is
a
sense,
as
i
was
just
trying
to
suggest,
in
which
it
does.
in
the
sense
that
the
defendant
has
to
intend
that
his
scheme
use
material
misrepresentations.
so,
in
that
sense,
because
the
whole...
the
statute
does
not
punish
completed
frauds,
is
not
limited
to
completed
frauds,
nor
is
it
limited
even
to
people
who
successfully
generate
a
scheme
to
defraud,
but
it
extends
even
to
people
who
are
trying
to
generate
a
scheme
to
defraud,
it
clearly
reaches
someone
who
is--
mr.
roy
w.
mcleese
--and
the
example...
because
what
you're--
mr.
roy
w.
mcleese
--i
think
it
falls
comfortably
within
the
language.
and
let
me
try
to
give...
because
materiality
is
kind
of
an
illusive
concept,
it
may
be
helpful
to
use
something
more
concrete.
if
the
statute
said,
if
it
reached
schemes
or
artifices
to
poison
by
means
of
a
toxic
substance,
a
defendant
who
generated
an
idea,
whereby
he
was
going
to
secure
some
chemicals
and
he
was
going
to
mix
them
together
and
administer
them
to
the
victim,
but
who
was
not
a
very
good
chemist
and
he
picked
some
substances
that
weren't
really
toxic,
such
a
defendant
would
have
clearly
created
a
scheme
to
poison
somebody
or
to...
to
kill
someone
by
administering
a
toxic
substance.
he
didn't
pick
a
good
one.
it's
not
a
good
scheme.
it's
not
very
well
crafted.
but
it
is
clearly
a
scheme
to--
mr.
roy
w.
mcleese
--and...
and,
moreover,
and...
and...
and
beyond
that,
because
the
statute
here
extends
not
just
to
people
who
successfully
create
schemes
to
defraud--
mr.
roy
w.
mcleese
--no,
there
isn't.
but,
in
fact
the--
mr.
roy
w.
mcleese
--the
wording
of
this
statute
is
very
different
from
the
common
law
concepts
of...
of
fraud.
this
statute
is
not
a
completed
fraud
statute.
what
it
says
is
it's
not
just
those
who
commit
fraud...
if
this
statute
said,
if
you
use
the
mails
in
commission
of
a
fraud,
clearly
the
petitioner
would
have
a
very
strong
argument
that
all
of
the...
the
requirements
of
fraud
be
carried
forward.
but
it
doesn't
say
that.
what
it
says
is,
any
scheme
to
defraud,
which
is
an
effort
or
plan
to
defraud.
and
then
it
goes
beyond
that
even
yet,
and
says,
people
who
use
the
mails
intending--
mr.
roy
w.
mcleese
--and
it
does.
but
my
point
is
that
if
the
reason
your
attempt
fails
is
because
you
pick
means
that
are
very
well
adapted
to
your
purpose,
you're
guilty
of
attempt
in
that
way...
and
that's
what
the
poison
example
was
meant
to
suggest...
if--
mr.
roy
w.
mcleese
--no,
i
don't
think
so.
because
there
is
no
general
federal
criminal
attempt
provision.
and
this...
what
happened
instead--
mr.
roy
w.
mcleese
--no,
you
should
treat
them
the
same.
but
the
only
point
is--
mr.
roy
w.
mcleese
--the
statute
is
not
a
completed
offense
provision.
if
the
statute
said
"completed
fraud",
then
we
would...
in
these
hypotheticals,
we
would
be
trying
to
figure
out
whether
those
were
attempts
for
a
completed
fraud.
mr.
roy
w.
mcleese
but
it's
not.
mr.
roy
w.
mcleese
no,
not
actual
materiality.
what
i
would
say
is--
mr.
roy
w.
mcleese
--yes.
i
would
say,
if
what
you...
if...
if
your
point
is
materiality
is
in
the
statute
in
the
same
way
that
reliance
is,
i
would
agree
with
you.
and
what
i
would
say
is
this...
that
in
order
for
something
to
be
a
scheme
or
artifice
to
defraud,
the
defendant
has
to
intend
that...
he
has
to
intend
that
the
victim
is
going
to
rely
on
his
deception.
that's
his...
that's
the
feature
of
the
fraud.
and
just
as
reliance
is
in
the
statute
in
that
way,
it's...
it's...
it
has
to
be
the
intended
feature
of
these
schemes
or
artifices
to
defraud
that
they
have
those
features
that
existed
at
common
law.
but
they
don't
actually
have
to
exist.
he
doesn't
actually
have
to
cause
reliance.
neither,
too,
does
he
actually
have
to
select
effective
means.
mr.
roy
w.
mcleese
yes.
mr.
roy
w.
mcleese
crucially
different,
but
very
close.
our
position
is
that
he
intend
that
they
be
objectively
material,
not
that
he--
mr.
roy
w.
mcleese
--no,
no.
what
i
mean
is
if
the
defendant
comes
in
and
he
says...
this
is
a
somewhat
silly
hypothetical...
but
if
a
defendant
sent
out
a
mailing
in
a
mail
fraud
case,
and
he
sent
out
a
mailing
which
said...
not
intending
to
perform
at
all;
it's
a
pure
scam...
if
you
give
me
1,000
in
advance,
i
will
give
you,
you
know,
a
week's
lodging
in
disney
world.
and
the
day
before
he
mails
that
out,
disney
world
was
burned
to
the
ground
and
everybody
knows
it.
so
that...
that's...
no
one
is
going
to
find
that
a
material
inducement.
that's
not
going
to
cause
any
reasonable
person,
or
any
person,
to
respond
favorably
to
his
scam.
that's
mail
fraud.
and
it's
mail
fraud
even
though
he's
picked
very
poor
means
to
achieve
his
end.
and
it's
mail
fraud
because
he
intended
that
his
deceptions
be
effective
on
the
victim,
although
he
failed
in
picking
good
deceptions
that
will
have--
mr.
roy
w.
mcleese
--my
point
is,
even
if
it
were
true,
that
that
would...
no...
no
reasonable
person
could
even
believe
that
anymore.
we
all
know
that
that's
no
longer
true.
mr.
roy
w.
mcleese
yes,
everyone
has
all
the
heard
the
news.
that's...
the
hypothetical
is
everyone
has
heard
the
news.
and
so
it's
just
utterly
ineffective.
mr.
roy
w.
mcleese
his
plan
was
it
would
be
effective,
but
it
is
in
fact
utterly
ineffective.
our...
the...
the
difference
is--
mr.
roy
w.
mcleese
--that's
correct.
mr.
roy
w.
mcleese
that's
correct.
and
in
fact,
in...
in
some
ways
i
think
that
supports
the
view
that
we're
taking.
because
at
the
time
i
send
out
a
mailing,
all
i
have
to
have
done
is
to
devise
or
intend
to
devise
a
scheme
to
defraud.
it's
a
very
inchoate
offense
in
certain
respects.
i
might
not
even
have
settled
on
which
material...
which...
which
representation,
material
or
otherwise,
i...
i
intend
to
make
in
my
scheme.
mr.
roy
w.
mcleese
no,
i
was
picking
an
example--
mr.
roy
w.
mcleese
--well,
i
think--
mr.
roy
w.
mcleese
--yes.
perhaps
my
hypothetical
was
not
as
well
crafted
as
it
might
have
been.
the
point
i'm
trying
to
illustrate
is
that
if
materiality
is
defined
as
having
a
natural
tendency
to
influence
people,
a
defendant
who
generates
a
scheme,
and
he
picks
out
a
misrepresentation
which
he
thinks
has
that
character,
because
he
intends
to
have
it
be
effective,
to
give...
to
cause
people
to
give
him
his
money,
and
for
whatever
reason,
he
picks
one
that
is...
is
not
material...
which
is
hard
to
imagine,
but
imagine
that
he
did...
that
is
mail
fraud.
because
all
that
the
statute,
by
its
language,
requires
is
that
he
intend
to
devise
a
scheme
to
defraud.
and
if
he
fails
because
he
picked
misrepresentations
that
are
not
effective
and
therefore
would
not
have
amounted
to
fraud
at
common
law,
he's
violated
the
plain
terms
of
the
statute.
mr.
roy
w.
mcleese
i
can't
imagine
that
anyone--
mr.
roy
w.
mcleese
--i
can't
imagine
that
anyone
would
ever
prosecute
such
a
situation.
but,
to
give
an
example--
mr.
roy
w.
mcleese
--in
pure
theory,
if
i
send
out
a
letter,
saying,
buy
my
gold
mine--
mr.
roy
w.
mcleese
--believing,
based
on
geological
information
that's
totally
worthless--
mr.
roy
w.
mcleese
--and
i
send
it
out,
i've
committed
mail
fraud
right
then.
and
i
don't
need
to
know
whether,
as
it
turns
out,
the
victim
got
it,
was
duped,
bought
it,
and
then
later
found
gold
there,
to...
to
the
geologists'
surprise.
that's
mail
fraud
even
if
i
happen
to
be
wrong.
what's
required
is
that
i
intend
that
my
scheme--
mr.
roy
w.
mcleese
--and...
and
it's
certainly...
i
mean,
whether
or
not
it's
a
scheme
to
defraud...
i
think
it
is...
by
the
statutory
language
is
people
who
intend
to
devise
a
scheme
to
defraud.
and
it
is
certainly
that.
i
can't...
i
just
don't
see
how
it
falls
short
of
intending
to
devise
a
scheme
to
defraud.
it
falls,
inevitably,
within
that
language.
if
the
court
has
no
further
questions,
we
would
request
that
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
be
affirmed.
