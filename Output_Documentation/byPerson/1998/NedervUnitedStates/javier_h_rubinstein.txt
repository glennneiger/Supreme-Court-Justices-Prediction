mr.
javier
h.
rubinstein
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
presents
two
entirely
distinct
questions:
whether
the
failure
of
the
trial
court
to
instruct
the
jury
on
an
element
of
the
crime
is
subject
harmless
error
review
even
if
the
element
was
not
in
dispute
at
trial;
and,
second,
whether
materiality
is
an
element
of
the
federal
mail,
wire
and
bank
fraud
statutes.
mr.
javier
h.
rubinstein
it
is,
your
honor.
although
johnson
did
not
squarely
present
the
question,
in
any
event,
since
there
had
been
no
contemporaneous
objection
to
the
error.
and,
as
a
result--
mr.
javier
h.
rubinstein
--it
was
a
plain
error
case;
that's
correct.
mr.
javier
h.
rubinstein
that
was
the
plan.
mr.
javier
h.
rubinstein
justice
scalia,
i
assume
you're
referring
to
the
phrasing
of
the
question
presented.
the
phrasing
of
the
question
presented
was
taken
from
the
government's
phraseology
of
the
question.
we
agree
that
having
pled
not
guilty
to
the
crime
and
having
specifically
requested
an
instruction
on
materiality,
that
no
court
could
constitutionally
declare
that
the
element
was
truly
uncontested.
however,
we
are--
mr.
javier
h.
rubinstein
--yes.
we
agree
that
materiality
was
not
the
central
focus
of
the
trial.
mr.
javier
h.
rubinstein
i
would...
i
would
agree
with
that.
in
this
case,
it
is
undisputed
that
the
trial
court
completely
removed--
mr.
javier
h.
rubinstein
--i
don't...
i
don't
believe
that,
on
a
retrial,
that
materiality
would
be
a
central
focus
of
any
defense
to
the
tax
fraud
charge.
i
would
agree
with
that,
justice
o'connor.
nonetheless,
it
is
undisputed
in
this
case
that
the
trial
court
completely
removed
the
element
of
materiality
on
the
tax
fraud
charge,
both
by
directing
a
verdict
on
that
element
in
favor
of
the
prosecution
and
by
then
instructing
the
jury
that
materiality
was
not
for
the
jury
to
decide.
the
court
of
appeals,
nonetheless,
declared
that
error
harmless--
mr.
javier
h.
rubinstein
--the
judge
explicitly
stated
on
the
record
that
the
question
of
materiality
was
for
the
court
to
decide,
not
for
the
jury
to
decide.
mr.
javier
h.
rubinstein
what--
mr.
javier
h.
rubinstein
--what
he
told
the...
he
did
not
tell
the
jury
that
the
court
had
found
materiality.
what
the
judge
instructed
the
jury
several
times
was
that
the
jury
was
not
to
be
concerned
with
the
question
or
materiality
because
the
materiality
was
not
for
the
jury
to
decide.
mr.
javier
h.
rubinstein
that's
correct.
mr.
javier
h.
rubinstein
that's
correct,
justice
o'connor.
we
believe
that
the
11th
circuit's
harmless
error
holding
must
be
reversed
for
at
least
three
reasons.
first,
the
trial
court's
constitutional
error
is
not
subject
to
harmless
error
scrutiny,
in
light
of
the
fact
that
element...
that
the
element
of
materiality
was
completely
removed
from
the
jury's
consideration.
mr.
javier
h.
rubinstein
that
would
depend
upon
whether
or
not
the
misinstruction
on
the
element
was
sufficiently
serious
that
the
jury
did
not
in
fact
find
the
actual
element
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
mr.
javier
h.
rubinstein
we
agree
with
that.
and
we
believe
that
it
does
not...
is
not
necessary
for
an
appellate
court
to
label
the
error
either
as
an
omission
or
a
misinstruction.
in...
in
any
case,
this
court
has
articulated
a
single
constitutional--
mr.
javier
h.
rubinstein
--what
the
jury
found--
mr.
javier
h.
rubinstein
--the
jury
did
not,
justice
kennedy,
and
for
this
reason.
what
the
jury
found
was
what
it
was
that
was
false
on
the
return,
and
that
it
was
done
willfully.
to
take
the
next
step,
to
find
that
the
misinformation
on
the
tax
return
was
false
as
to
a
material
matter,
the
jury
would
then
have
to
be
instructed
and
consider
whether
or
not
that
would
be
false
as
to
a
material
matter
from
the
standpoint
of
whether
it
would
be
naturally
calculated
to
influence
the
audience
to
which
it
was
addressed.
regardless
of
how
straightforward
it
may
have
been--
mr.
javier
h.
rubinstein
--the...
yes,
there
was.
but,
nonetheless,
the
jury
was
not
told,
first
of
all,
that
it
had
to
consider
whether
or
not
that
would
be
naturally
intended
to
influence
the
audience
to
which
it
was
addressed.
and
regardless--
mr.
javier
h.
rubinstein
--the
functional
difference
is
this.
in
sullivan,
this
court
articulated
this
concept
of
functional
equivalence.
and
it
was,
again,
further
elaborated
by
justice
scalia,
in
his
concurring
opinion
in
roy.
and
the
test
is
this:
functional
equivalence
occurs
where
the
jury
actually
finds
the
element
in
question,
either
by
its
consideration
of
other
elements
on
other
counts
or
because
the
jury
could
not
have
found
what
it
did
find
without
actually
finding
the
element
that
was
removed.
it
is
not
enough
to
say
that
the
jury
found
three
things
and
that
surely
the
jury
would
have
found
the
fourth
element.
that
is
precisely
what
this
court,
in
sullivan,
said
that
cannot
be
done.
mr.
javier
h.
rubinstein
we
don't
believe
that
it
would
have
that
type
of
broad
effect
for
two
reasons.
first,
pope
was
actually
a
case
in
which
functional
equivalence
was
found.
that
may
occur
from
time
to
time.
but
i
think,
more
importantly,
this
court's
decision
in
johnson
will
serve
to
have
a
very
substantial
limiting
effect.
mr.
javier
h.
rubinstein
in
johnson,
there
was
no
contemporaneous
objection
to
the
instructional
error.
the
defendant
had
argued
that
that
failure
to
object
should
essentially
have
been
disregarded.
this
court
said
that
constitutional
rights
can
be
forfeit,
and
that
by
failing
to
object
on
a
timely
basis
to
the
instruction,
that
the
defendant
had
in
fact
forfeited
the
right
to
have
the
jury
instruct
to
be...
have
the
jury
instructed
on
that
element.
mr.
javier
h.
rubinstein
that's
exactly
correct,
justice
o'connor.
mr.
javier
h.
rubinstein
well,
in...
in
the...
i
think
the
key
point...
i
want
to
make
sure
i
understand
your
question,
justice
kennedy...
we
believe
that
what
you
just
said
in
terms
of
sullivan
is
exactly
correct,
and
that
in
this
case
there
is
nothing
that
the
harmless
error
scrutiny
can
operate
on,
since
there
was
no
complete
verdict
on
every
element
of
the
crime.
the
reason
that
that
principle
was
not
applied
in
johnson
is
because
the
constitutional
right
that
underlied
this
court's
decision
in
sullivan,
which
is
the
constitutional
right
to
have
the
jury
render
a
verdict
of
guilty
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
on
every
element--
mr.
javier
h.
rubinstein
--i
don't
believe
it
is,
justice
ginsburg,
for
a
couple
of
reasons.
first
of
all,
i
don't
believe
that
it's
possible
in
this
case
to
find
that
the
jury
actually
did
find
materiality,
given
the
judge's
explicit
instruction
to
the
jury
several
times
that
materiality
was
not
a
matter
for
the
jury
to
decide.
and
this
court,
over
and
again,
has
reinforced
the
proposition
that
juries
are
presumed
to
follow
the
instructions
that
they
are
given
by
the
court.
mr.
javier
h.
rubinstein
what
they
had
to
find
was
that
there
was
in
fact
false
information
in
the
tax
return--
mr.
javier
h.
rubinstein
--and
that
it
was
willfully
misstated.
mr.
javier
h.
rubinstein
i
believe
that
there
would
have
been...
the
jury
would
have
been
instructed
as
to
what
it
was
that
was...
was
alleged
in
the
indictment.
mr.
javier
h.
rubinstein
because
the
jury
was
not...
in
order
to
take
that
next
step,
to
make
the
finding
of
materiality,
the
jury
would
have
to
find
that
what
it
was
that
was
misstated
in
the
tax
return
would
have
a
natural
tendency
to
influence
the
audience
to
which
it
is
addressed.
the
jury
never
gave
any
consideration
to
that
question.
mr.
javier
h.
rubinstein
well--
mr.
javier
h.
rubinstein
--we
don't
believe
that
the
jury
found...
what
the
jury
found
was
an
amount.
there
is
then
another
step
that
has
to
be
taken,
which
is
to
apply
the
law--
mr.
javier
h.
rubinstein
--well,
we
would
agree
that
the
element--
mr.
javier
h.
rubinstein
--that's
correct.
mr.
javier
h.
rubinstein
that's
correct.
mr.
javier
h.
rubinstein
well,
i'd
like
to
answer
that
in
two
ways.
first
of
all--
mr.
javier
h.
rubinstein
--well,
i'll
answer
that
i
believe
the
jury...
i
don't
believe
that
a
jury
could
not
have
found
materiality
had
it
been
instructed
to
consider
it.
but
i
think
the
critical
distinction
here
is
that,
as
this
court
held
in
sullivan,
when
the
jury
is
not
instructed
to
consider
a
particular
element,
or
when
there
is
not--
mr.
javier
h.
rubinstein
--well,
we
actually
do
have
here,
at
the
end
of
the
day,
the
same
error
that
was--
mr.
javier
h.
rubinstein
--actually,
we
don't
believe
that
we
did.
because
what
sullivan
said
is
that
when
there
is
not
a
verdict
within
the
meaning
of
the
sixth
amendment,
which
means
a
verdict
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
on
every
element
of
the
crime,
there
is
no
object
that
the
harmless
error
scrutiny
can
operate--
mr.
javier
h.
rubinstein
--that's
true.
but,
at
the
end
of
the
day,
the
result
is
the
same
here
because
you
still
do
not
have
a
constitutional
verdict
within
the
meaning
of
the
sixth
amendment.
mr.
javier
h.
rubinstein
yes.
mr.
javier
h.
rubinstein
the
reason,
justice
breyer,
is
that
this
court
has
never
allowed
harmless
error
review
to
occur
when
the
jury
did
not
itself
actually
find
every
element
of
the
crime
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
mr.
javier
h.
rubinstein
the
reason
that
removal--
mr.
javier
h.
rubinstein
--the
reason
that
removal
of
an
element
from
the
jury's
consideration
must
be
regarded
as
one
of
the
small
class
of
structural
errors
is
because
the
error
in
that
case
is
that
the
wrong
entity
has
served
as
the
finder
of
fact
on
the
element
that
was
removed.
it
is
a
structural
error
because
it...
the
right
that
we
are
talking
about
is
the
preservation
of
the
line
that
has
always
separated
the
constitutional
role
of
the
judge
and
the
jury.
mr.
javier
h.
rubinstein
well,
i
think
the
analysis
there
would
be
akin
to
what
this
court
said
in
pope.
if
the
reviewing
court
looks
at
what
the
jury
actually
found,
and
finds
that
in
making
that
finding
it
also
did
find
the
misinstructed
element,
then
it
would
be
subject
to
harmless
error
review.
on
the
other
hand,
if
you
have
a
situation
where
the
misinstruction
is
sufficiently
egregious,
that
in
fact
the
jury
did
not
find
the
misinstructed
element
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
then
it
would
not
be
subject
to
harmless
error.
mr.
javier
h.
rubinstein
well--
mr.
javier
h.
rubinstein
--i
think...
well,
on
that
last
point,
mr.
chief
justice,
the--
mr.
javier
h.
rubinstein
--that's
correct.
and
so
it
would
only
require
a
new
trial
in
those
rare
instances
where
the
element
is
removed,
a
timely
objection
is
made,
and
the
trial
court,
nonetheless,
insists
on
refusing
to
instruct
or
in
giving
the
misinstruction.
mr.
javier
h.
rubinstein
i'm
sorry.
mr.
javier
h.
rubinstein
well,
even...
even
in
the
case
where
it
is
debatable,
if
the
objection
is
made
at
trial,
the
judge
believing
it
to
be
a
debatable
question,
refuses
to
give
the
correction
instruction,
and,
on
direct
review,
it
is
determined
that
the
correct
element
was
not
actually
found
by
the
jury,
it
would
require
a
new
trial.
mr.
javier
h.
rubinstein
the
reason,
justice
kennedy,
is
that,
as
this
court
held
in
gaudin,
the
most
important
component
of
the
right
to
a
jury
trial
is
to
have
only
the
jury
serve
as
the
finder
of
fact,
and
to
have
only
the
jury
serve
as
the
judge
of
guilt
or
innocence.
and
even
in
a
case
where
it
is
believed
by
the
reviewing
court
that
the
element
was
not
in
dispute,
it
is
not
within
the
power
of
the
appellate
court
to
declare
the
removal
of
an
element
harmless
for
the
same
reason
that
it
is
not
within
the
power
of
any
judge
to
direct
a
verdict
of
guilt
on
the
element.
mr.
javier
h.
rubinstein
no,
in
a...
in
a
coerced
confession
case,
you
would
have
a
jury
verdict
on
every
element
of
the
crime,
and
the
court
would
have
the
jury's
actual
findings
to
use
as
a
backdrop
to
assess
whether
or
not
the
error
in
fact
was
harmless
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
mr.
javier
h.
rubinstein
roy
was
a
case...
was
a
state
case,
a
habeas
case.
mr.
javier
h.
rubinstein
i
believe
that
in
roy
there
was
in
fact
a
misinstruction
on
the
element
of
intent.
although
i
grant
you--
mr.
javier
h.
rubinstein
--well--
[laughter]
mr.
javier
h.
rubinstein
it
does
not
matter
to
us.
mr.
javier
h.
rubinstein
it
doesn't
matter.
mr.
javier
h.
rubinstein
either
way,
the
analysis
is
the
same,
in
terms
of
determining
whether
or
not
the
error
is
subject
to
harmless
error
review.
did
the
jury
actually
find
the
correct
element
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt?
if
it
did
not,
then
the
error
is
not
subject
to
harmless
error
review,
regardless
of
whether
one
characterizes
it
as
a
misdescription
or
an
omission.
either
way,
if
the
appellate
court
declares
the
error
harmless
in
that
setting,
where
the
jury
did
not
actually
find
it,
the
wrong
entity
has
judged
that
element.
and
the
wrong
entity
has
judged
the
defendant
guilty.
that
is
the
structural
error.
and
this
court--
mr.
javier
h.
rubinstein
--pope
was
a
case
in
which
this
court
found
that
the
jury's
finding
on
the
misinstructed
obscenity
instruction
was
functional
equivalent
to
the
correct
element.
mr.
javier
h.
rubinstein
right.
as
justice
scalia
has
pointed
out
in
his
concurring
opinion
in
carella,
and
as
this
court
also
explained
in
sullivan
itself,
the
reason
that
the
error
in
pope
was
found
to
have
been
subject
to
harmless
error
review
was
because
no
jury
could...
no
jury
could
have
found
what
it
did
find
without
actually
finding
the
correct
element,
as
well.
mr.
javier
h.
rubinstein
that's
correct.
mr.
javier
h.
rubinstein
and
i
think
the...
the
key
was
that,
in
pope
itself,
this
court
explained
that
the
jury
was
not
precluded
from
considering
the
element
of
obscenity.
it
is,
therefore,
completely
different
than
a
case
like
this,
where
the
jury
is
given
no
opportunity
to
consider
the
element.
and
as
a
result,
you
do
not
have
an
incomplete
jury
verdict.
mr.
javier
h.
rubinstein
what
i...
i
think,
to
complete
that
thought,
no
rational
jury
could
have
found
what
it
did
find,
based
on
the
misinstruction,
without
also
finding
the
correct
element,
as
well.
and
therefore,
you
have
what
this
court,
in
sullivan,
described
as
functional
equivalence.
mr.
javier
h.
rubinstein
not
in
this
case.
because
the
jury
was
explicitly
told
that
materiality
was
not
for
the
jury
to
decide.
and
the
jury--
mr.
javier
h.
rubinstein
--we
believe
that
that
is
the
lesson
of
sullivan.
mr.
javier
h.
rubinstein
that's
correct.
if
the
jury--
mr.
javier
h.
rubinstein
--because
in
the
first
hypothetical,
the
jury
itself
has
found
the
element
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
in
the
second
hypothetical,
where
the
jury
makes
certain
factual
findings
through
other
elements,
and
where
the
court
concludes,
well,
the
jury
would
have
to
have
found
that
third
element
had
it
considered
it,
the
appellate
court,
when
it
declares
the
error
harmless,
itself
has
become
the
finder
of
fact
on
that
element.
mr.
javier
h.
rubinstein
it's
because
of
the
need
to
have
the
jury
itself
make
the
finding
of
guilt
of
that
element
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
and
that
is
the
line
that
has
pervaded
this
court's
harmless
error
jurisprudence
since
chapman
itself.
mr.
javier
h.
rubinstein
that...
that's
precisely
correct.
mr.
javier
h.
rubinstein
right.
well,
but,
in
this
case,
the
jury,
in
making
the
findings
that
it
did
make
on
the
tax
fraud
charges,
did
not
have
to
make
a
finding
of
materiality
at
all.
and
in
fact,
we
know
that
because
the
judge
specifically
told
the
jury--
mr.
javier
h.
rubinstein
--if
the
judge
had
made--
mr.
javier
h.
rubinstein
--no
instruct
at
all
on
materiality--
mr.
javier
h.
rubinstein
--and
i
assume
the
judge
would
not
itself...
would
not
himself
have
made
that
finding...
if
there
had
been
no
instruction
at
all,
i
think
we
would
have...
we
would
be
in
the
situation.
because
nothing
the
jury
found
would
require
it
to
have
made
the
finding
of
materiality.
i'd
like
briefly
to
address
the
second
question
presented.
we
believe
that
the
11th
circuit
wrongly
held
that
materiality
is
not
an
element
of
the
mail,
wire
and
bank
fraud
statutes.
the
statutes
each
identically
prohibit
a
scheme
or
artifice
to
defraud.
by
using
the
term
"defraud"
in
the
statute,
a
well-defined
common
law
term
that
always
has
required
proof
of
a
material
falsehood,
congress
necessarily
incorporated
into
these
statutes
the
common
law
requirement
of
materiality.
the
notion
that
a
scheme
or
artifice
to
defraud
requires
proof
of
a
material
misrepresentation
or
omission
is
nothing
new.
this
court
already
has
determined
in
other
contexts
that
the
same
language
requires
proof
of
materiality.
mr.
javier
h.
rubinstein
right.
the
reason
for
that,
justice
o'connor,
is
that
the
statute
does
not
require
a
completed
fraud.
what
it
targets
is
the
scheme
to
defraud.
reliance
would
only
arise
if
the
scheme
was
actually
carried
out.
and
there
is
no
requirement
in
the
statute
that
it
be
carried
out.
however,
a
scheme
cannot
be
a
scheme
to
defraud
unless
it
includes
a
material
falsehood
as
one
of
its
essential
elements.
with
the
court's
permission,
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
javier
h.
rubinstein
the
government
incorrectly
suggests
that
the
test
we
are
advocating
for
whether
or
not
an
error
is
subject
to
harmless
error
review
is
somehow
a
new
test
or
that
it
would
present
new
practical
problems.
the
test
that
we
are
urging
the
court
to
follow
is
precisely
the
same
test
that
it
articulated
in
sullivan
and
in
yates:
was...
did
the
jury
actually
find
every
element
of
the
crime
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt?
that
is
the
question
the
court
has
to
answer.
if
the
jury
did
not,
then
the
error
is
not
subject
to
harmless
error
review.
the
government
also
places
heavy
reliance
on
the
evidence
concerning
materiality.
but
as
this
court
has
pointed
out,
when
the
jury
is
told
to
ignore
an
element,
the
evidence
pertaining
to
that
element
vanishes.
the
jury
has
nothing
to
assess
that
evidence
through.
that
is
what
the
jury's
instructions
are
for.
ultimately,
we
believe,
as
the
government
correctly
concedes,
not
every
jury
would
be
required
to
find
that
a
failure
to
report
income
is
material.
that's
exactly
our
point.
it
is
for
the
jury
to
decide,
under
the
circumstances
of
each
particular
case,
whether
or
not
materiality
was
established.
at
the
end
of
the
day,
if
the
element
of
materiality
is
taken
away
from
the
jury,
no
appellate
court
can
declare
that
harmless
for
the
same
reason
that
a
court
cannot
direct
a
verdict
of
guilt.
mr.
javier
h.
rubinstein
the
gold
mine
hypothetical
would
obviously
have
involved
a
material
misrepresentation.
if
someone--
mr.
javier
h.
rubinstein
--well,
ultimately,
if
the...
if
the
defendant
makes
a
statement
he
believes
to
be
false
but
that
actually
turns
out,
by
sheer
luck,
to
have
been
true--
mr.
javier
h.
rubinstein
--that's
correct.
mr.
javier
h.
rubinstein
well,
in
our
view,
certainly.
but
we
agree
with
the
government
that
the
statute
covers
not
only
the
actual
devising,
but
the
intent
to
devise.
but
it
must
include
a
material
misrepresentation.
thank
you.
