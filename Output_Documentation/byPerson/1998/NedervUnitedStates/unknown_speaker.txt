unknown
speaker
the
first
question
is
the
one
that
we
reserved
in
our
johnson
opinion,
is
it
not?
unknown
speaker
and
it
was
a
plain
error?
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
you,
before
you
go
on
with
number
one.
i
assume
you're
going
to
take
number
one
before
you
take
number
two?
unknown
speaker
okay.
why
do
you
say
that
it
was
not
in
dispute
in
the
trial?
wasn't
there
a
general
denial
of
the
indictment?
unknown
speaker
not
in
dispute.
but
you
acknowledge
that
you
didn't
bring
in
any...
any
evidence
or
argumentation
specifically
directed
to
that
point?
unknown
speaker
not
the
cent...
it
wasn't
the
focus
at
all?
unknown
speaker
indeed,
if
it
goes
back
for
some
reason,
if
we
agree
with
you
and
it's
retried,
you
don't
really
think
the
government's
going
to
have
any
trouble
proving
materiality,
i
assume?
unknown
speaker
let
me
just...
let
me
just
be
sure
i
understand.
how
did
he
direct
the
verdict
on
that
issue?
unknown
speaker
so,
he
didn't
tell
the
jury
to
make
a
finding
of
materiality--
unknown
speaker
--i
mean,
he
didn't
direct
the
jury
to
do
that?
unknown
speaker
and
what
was
what
he
told
them
even
on
the
tax
count?
unknown
speaker
where
materiality
is
mentioned
in
the
statute.
unknown
speaker
well,
what
if
the
district
court,
instead
of
omitting
to
charge
the
jury
at
all
on
materiality,
had
given
it
an
erroneous
charge
on
materiality
would
that,
too,
be
not
subject
to
harmless
error
review?
unknown
speaker
so,
then,
we
really...
no...
no...
no
court
would
know
in
advance,
no
court
of
appeals
would
know
in
advance
without...
it's
a
case-by-case
analysis
in
your
view?
unknown
speaker
but
under
your
test,
in
answer
to
the
chief
justice's
question,
that
would...
the
jury
would
have
found
those
facts
despite
the
misinstruction.
that
really
happened
here.
the
man
understated
his
income.
anybody
knows
that
that
reduced
his
income
tax.
and
he
did
it
willfully.
i
mean,
what...
what
more
is
there
to
decide?
unknown
speaker
why
didn't
the
jury
in
fact
find
in
this
case
all
of
the
circumstances
necessary
to
show
materiality?
unknown
speaker
was
there
evidence
as
to
the
amount
of
the
tax
that
was
avoided
or
the
approximate
amount?
unknown
speaker
i'm
not
sure
of
the
difference
between
the
case
we
have
before
us
and
the
hypothetical
given
by
the
chief
justice.
one,
the...
the
trial
court
makes
a
real
hash
out
of
the
materiality
instruction.
the
other,
he
doesn't
instruct
at
all.
the
other,
he
says,
it's
for
me.
what's
the
functional
difference
in
those?
unknown
speaker
well,
so
then,
then,
there
will
be
very
little
subject
to
harmless
error
review
even
if
it's
an
erroneous
instruction
rather
than,
under
your
view,
even
rather
than
an
omission?
unknown
speaker
well,
let's
talk
about
johnson,
because
that's
a
case
where
the
court
found
there
was
plain
error
and
there
was
a
failure
to
instruct,
and
we
applied
harmless
error
analysis.
unknown
speaker
so,
had
there
been
no
objection
here,
we
would
be
in
a
johnson
situation?
unknown
speaker
well,
why...
if
that
is
so,
why
couldn't
we
say
just
what
the
court
said
in
sullivan,
that
there's
really
nothing
for
us
to
operate
on,
we
can't
speculate
on
what
the
jury
would
have
found?
what...
what's
the
difference
in
those
two
instances?
unknown
speaker
mr.
rubinstein,
i
don't
understand
that
there
isn't
this
functional
equivalent.
let's...
let's
say
we
accept
your
theory
that
you
can't
leave
something
out
and
have
the
jury
never
find
it
and
say,
well,
they
would
have
found
it
anyway.
but
the
notion,
which
was
not
explored
by
the
court
of
appeals
as
far
as
i
know,
of
the
possibility
that
this
does
meet
the
functional
equivalence
test,
that's
still
open
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
were
they
instructed
in
such
a
way
that
in
order
to
return
a
verdict
of
guilty
they
had
to
find
that
the
amount
charged
in
the
indictment
was
in
fact
the
understatement?
unknown
speaker
and
did
they
have
to--
unknown
speaker
--and
did
they
have
to
find
that
the
false
information
was...
was
the
information
charged...
in
other
words,
an
understatement
of...
what
was
it...
several
million
dollars?
unknown
speaker
right.
if...
if
that's...
if
that
is
fairly
presupposed
then
by
the
jury
verdict,
why
isn't
the...
this
a
situation
in
which
we
have
to
say,
necessarily,
they
must
have
found
an
amount
that
was
material?
unknown
speaker
but
you...
you
don't...
you
don't
disagree
with
justice
souter...
with
what
justice
souter
said.
it
seems
to
me
you
concede
that
the
jury
found
an
amount
which
was
material.
you...
you
said
earlier
that
you
wouldn't...
you
wouldn't
contest
that...
on
retrial,
you
would
thought
it
would
be
very
difficult
to
contest
that
this
amount
wasn't
material.
unknown
speaker
the
jury
found
an
amount
which
was
material.
but
the
jury
did
not
find
that
the
amount
which
it
found
was
material.
unknown
speaker
and
you
acknowledge...
you
acknowledge
the
amount
is
material?
unknown
speaker
so,
the
jury
found
an
amount
which
was
material.
but
the
jury
did
not
find
materiality.
unknown
speaker
that's
your
objection.
unknown
speaker
could
the
jury
have
found
anything
else?
in
other
words,
there...
there...
there
are
certainly
plenty
of
case...
borderline
cases...
in
which
it
may
or
may
not
be
material,
the
jury
goes
one
way
in
one
case,
another
in
another
case.
is...
is
it,
as
a
matter
of
law,
possible
for
a
jury
to
find...
would
it,
as
a
matter
of
law,
have
been
possible
for
the
jury
to
find
anything
but
that
this
was
a
material
amount?
unknown
speaker
well,
how
about
yes
or
no
first?
unknown
speaker
that's
not
what
the
court
held
in
sullivan.
the
court
held
in
sullivan
on...
that
had
they
not
been
charged
on
a
reasonable
doubt.
they
didn't
say
every
single
element.
unknown
speaker
well,
but
you're...
you're
talking
about
what
the
holding
was
in
sullivan.
i
think
you've
just
misstated
it.
unknown
speaker
but
sullivan
didn't
involve
charges
on
the
elements
of
the
crime
at
all.
unknown
speaker
but
why?
why
is
that?
why
not?
suppose...
suppose
it
stems
from
a
case
called
rose,
which
says
almost
all
error
is
harmless,
subject
to
harmless
error.
the
only
things
that
are
automatic
are
those
basic
protections
a
criminal
trial
cannot
reliably
serve
its
function
without
no...
in
other
words...
totally
unfair
disaster.
all
right.
now,
the
only
things
this
court
has
said
were
just
totally
unfair
disaster
are
reasonable
doubt
instruction,
racial
discrimination...
a
real
handful
of
constitutional
matters.
they
have
said,
as
well,
that
things
like
involuntary
confession
are
not
in
that
category.
so,
why
would
we
put
this
kind
of
thing,
which
seems
so
technical,
which
seems
so
close
to
an
ordinary
misinstruction?
why,
when
involuntary
confessions
are
not
in
that
category?
why,
when,
one
after
another
constitutional
errors,
there
is
no
constitutional
error
but
for
a
handful
that
are
automatically
reversible?
why
is
this
thing,
that
would
create
all
kinds
of
confusion
about
when...
when...
when
it
is...
well,
you
see
my
point--
unknown
speaker
--it
will
create
confusion
about
when,
indeed,
you
have
just
misinstructed
and
when
you
haven't
instructed
at
all,
et
cetera.
it
seems
trivial
in
many
cases
compared
to
other
things.
why
is
that
a
candidate?
unknown
speaker
i'm
sure
you're
right
in
quoting
the
cases.
what
i'm
asking
you
is,
if
i've
been
reading
those
cases,
believe
the
issue
is
open,
why
would
i
decide,
if
it's
open,
that
this
kind
of
thing,
which
is
so
easily
like
just
a
misinstruction,
which
is
bad
but
surely
no
worse
than
a...
than
a...
than
a
beaten-up
confession,
surely
no
worse
than
dozens
of
other
things
that
don't
cat...
don't
fall
in
that
category,
why
does
this
one
fall
in
that
category
when
these
other
things
don't?
unknown
speaker
in
effective
assistance
of
counsel,
i
mean,
you
know,
a
lot
of
things.
unknown
speaker
well,
supposing
you
take
a
mis...
a
misinstruction
rather
than
a
failure
to
instruct.
now,
there
you...
you
couldn't
say
with
the
same
confidence
that
the
wrong
entity
has
made
the
finding?
unknown
speaker
well,
but
that,
in
itself,
is
a
very
confusing
standard,
i
think.
unknown
speaker
i
mean,
if...
if
we
adopt
your
view,
we're
opening
up
to
new
trial
not
just
failure
to
instruct
at
all,
but
all
sorts
of
misinstruction,
it
seems
to
me.
unknown
speaker
only
where
there's
been
objection.
unknown
speaker
well,
supposing
there's...
there's
a
fair...
it's
a
fairly
debatable
point.
now,
materiality
perhaps
isn't.
but
you
have
all
sorts
of
federal...
you
don't
have
to
look
at
the
clock.
unknown
speaker
there
are
all
sorts
of
federal
statutes
that
may
have
debatable
points
in
them,
that
a
trial
judge
may
say,
i
don't
agree
with
the
defendant
or
i
don't
agree
with
the
prosecution.
so,
it
isn't
simply
a
case
where
the
trial
judge
obstinately
refuses
to
do
something
that
he
ought
to
do.
it
may
be
fairly
debatable.
unknown
speaker
but
it's
not
clear
to
me
what
the
reason,
the
underlying
rationale,
for
your...
for
your
argument.
justice
breyer
gave
you
a
list...
coerced
confessions,
really
egregious
errors.
but
this
is
subject
to
harmless.
then
the
judge
forgets
to...
or
doesn't
instruct
on
interstate
commerce,
over
an
objection.
everybody
knows
a
car
is
in
interstate
commerce.
all
of
a
sudden
we
have
some
automatic
reversal.
i
don't
see
the
reason
for
this.
unknown
speaker
well...
well,
i
suppose...
i
suppose
you
could
say
that
it's...
it's
wrong
to
have
a
coerced
confession
submitted
to
the
jury.
there
is
nothing
for
the
jury
to
operate
on.
unknown
speaker
what--
--i'll
make...
no,
please,
you
had
started.
what
is
roy?
unknown
speaker
i
know.
but
which...
which
is
it
in
your
opinion?
what
was...
it
was
a
failure
of
the...
the
court
misinstructed
on
the
intent,
saying
you
just
have
to
have
knowledge.
or
was
it
that
he
failed
to
give
any
instruction
on
intent,
which
was
in
fact
a
basic
element
of
the
offense,
or
perhaps,
in
other
words...
which
is
it,
in
your
opinion?
unknown
speaker
oh,
why
isn't
it?
you
see,
whatever
you
were
going
to
say
there,
i
was
then
going
to
take
the
opposite
point
of
view.
unknown
speaker
but
does...
does
it
matter...
does
it
matter
to
you?
unknown
speaker
it
doesn't
matter
to
you?
unknown
speaker
i
mean,
it
may
be
a
difficult
question
but,
as
far
as
you're
concerned,
it's
irrelevant.
unknown
speaker
but,
mr.
rubinstein,
i
really
don't
think
your
argument
squares
with
the
court's
holding
in
pope.
unknown
speaker
no,
they
concluded
by
saying,
if
on
remand,
the
illinois
court
can...
concludes
that
no
rational
jury,
if
properly
instructed,
could
find
value
in
the
magazines,
the
conviction
should
stand.
unknown
speaker
of
course,
that's
now
what
pope
itself
says.
unknown
speaker
okay.
unknown
speaker
but
you're
saying...
just
to
be
sure
i
understand
your
position...
you're
saying
that
even
if
we
conclude
that
no
rational
juror,
if
properly
instructed,
could
fail
to
find
materiality,
we
should
nevertheless
say
it's
not
harmless?
unknown
speaker
well,
in
other
words,
you're
saying
no
rational
juror
could
find
that
the
amount
of
money
that
was
withheld
from...
left
out
of
the
income
tax
return
without
also
finding
materiality?
unknown
speaker
no,
but
i'm
saying
your
view
is
that
even
if
we
conclude
that
no
rational
juror
could
have
failed
to
find
materiality,
having
found
all
the
other
contested
issues
in
favor
of
the
government,
we
should,
nevertheless,
say
that...
just
the
exact
opposite
of
what
the
last
sentence
of
the
pope
opinion
says?
unknown
speaker
are
you
drawing...
if
i
understand
this
line...
you're
saying
that
if
the
jury
makes
a
finding...
call
it
a...
finding
a
necessarily
implies
a
finding
b,
which
it
did
not
make
and
was
not
instructed
to
make;
that
in
that
case,
there
may
be
harmless
error,
because
it
made
a
finding
and
the
finding
necessarily
implies
the
one
that
should
have
been
on
the
issue
that
should
have
been
submitted
to
it.
but,
by
contrast,
you're
saying,
if
the
jury
doesn't
make
any
finding
on
an
issue,
an
a-b
equivalence
issue,
but
on
a
third
issue,
c,
which
necessarily
implies
the
finding
b,
that's
not
good
enough?
unknown
speaker
why,
if...
if
there
is...
in
each
case,
there
is
a
necessary
implication.
in
the
first
case,
the
necessary
implication
is...
is
what
we
call
equivalence.
in
the
second
case,
the
necessarily...
the
necessary
implication
is
in
fact
just
that.
you
cannot
have
c
without
b.
why
is
it
sensible
for
us
to
draw
that
line?
unknown
speaker
but
isn't
it...
isn't
it
necessary
implication
that
connects
a
and
b
in
the
first
case?
and
if
so,
why
isn't
the
necessary
implication
sufficient
to
connect
c
and
b
in
the
second
case?
unknown
speaker
mr.
rubin--
--it's
the
difference
between
saying
that
a
finding
of
x
includes
a
finding
of
y
and
saying
that
any
jury
that
found
x
would
surely,
if
it
was
a
reasonable
jury,
have
found
y,
even
though
it
isn't
necessarily
included?
unknown
speaker
but
isn't...
isn't
that
an
issue...
is...
is
that
perhaps
an
issue
of
characterization,
though?
because,
on
the
one
hand,
you
can
say
a
jury
that
found
x
would
necessarily
find
y.
another
way,
it
seems
to
me,
of
saying
it
is
that
the...
that
the
jury,
in
finding
x,
was
necessarily
assuming
y;
i.e.,
it
was
necessarily
assuming
a
proportion
which
we
know
as...
or
an
importance,
say...
which
we
know
as
materiality.
unknown
speaker
mr.
rubinstein,
would
you
be
here
making
the
same
argument
if
the
judge
had
just
not
mentioned
to
the
jury
anything
about
materiality?
he
didn't
tell
them,
don't
you
consider
it.
unknown
speaker
he
just
failed
to
instruct.
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
well,
the
common
law
also
required
reliance.
and
yet,
it
seems
reasonably
clear
we
don't
consider
reliance
an
element.
unknown
speaker
very
well,
mr.
rubinstein.
mr.
mcleese,
we'll
hear
from
you.
how
many
angels
do
you
think
can
dance
on
the
head
of
a
pin?
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
how
many
elements
does...
does
this
convenient
theory
apply
to,
mr.
mcleese,
just...
just
one
element,
or
can
we
apply
it
to
all
elements,
and
just
say,
we've
amassed
all
of
this
evidence,
look
at
all
of
this
evidence,
no
reasonable
jury
in
the
world
could
possibly
see
all
of
this
evidence
and
not
find
this
person
guilty--
unknown
speaker
--and
therefore,
we
don't
need
a
trial?
unknown
speaker
how
many?
one
out
of
three?
two
out
of
three?
what?
unknown
speaker
so,
one
is
your
limit?
only...
only
one?
unknown
speaker
two...
two
might
be
enough?
unknown
speaker
so,
as
long
as
the
jury
finds
something...
the
jury
just
has
to
find
something?
unknown
speaker
it
doesn't
have
to
find
the
whole
crime?
unknown
speaker
mr.
mcleese,
it
may
be
angels
dancing
on
the
head
of
a
pin,
but
i
don't
see
any
other
line
that
we
can
take.
i
mean,
that's
the
problem.
our...
our
bill
of
rights
requires
that
you
be
found
guilty
by
a
jury.
and
that
means
that...
you
can
say
it
either
means
every
element
has
to
be
found
by
the
jury
or
else
we're
left,
as
you
are,
to
say,
well,
gee,
i
don't
know
how
many
elements.
a
jury
has
to
find
something;
that's
all.
i
don't
see
any...
any
line
between
the
two.
and
if
you
say
a
jury
has
to
find
all
elements,
it
means
that
a
judge
cannot
say,
well,
you
know,
had
they
been
asked
this,
the
evidence
was
so
massive,
they
surely
would
have
found
it.
that's
not
trial
by
jury;
it's
trial
by
judge.
unknown
speaker
but
the
jury
found
him
guilty
of
all
of
the
elements
of
the
crime.
now,
you
can
say
the
procedures
by
which
they
found
him
guilty,
there
may
have
been
something
wrong
with
them,
and
we'll
inquire
as
to
whether
that
was
harmless
or
not,
but
the
jury
found
him
guilty
of
every
element
of
the
crime
in...
in--
unknown
speaker
--the
fact
that
the
two
are
different
in
kind
and
not
just
in
degree
is
demonstrated
by
the
fact
that
we
do
not
allow
judges
to
direct
verdicts
in
criminal
cases.
if
what
you
said
were
correct...
if
there
is
no
difference
between
saying,
you
know,
since
this
evidence
being
left
out
made
no
difference,
it's
okay,
and
saying,
well,
the
jury
didn't
make
a
finding
on
this,
but
that's
okay...
if
the
two
are
equivalent,
then
we
should
allow
judges
to
direct
verdict
in
really
easy
cases.
unknown
speaker
and
save
us
a
lot
of
money
in...
in
the
whole
jury
process.
unknown
speaker
mr.
mcleese,
i
have
a
more
practical,
less
fundamental,
question
than
justice
scalia's.
and
that
is,
in
an
income
tax
fraud
case,
we're
talking
about
a
failure
to
report,
what,
many
millions,
if
you're
right
about
the
harmless
error,
then
the
materiality
element
for
the
jury
really
would
have
nothing...
no
teeth.
because
it
would
always
be
harmless
when
you
have
a
case
of
understating
income
by
large
amounts.
when...
when
would
the
failure
to
tell
the
jury
you
decide
materiality
ever
be
harmful?
i
mean,
it
always
be
harm...
harmless
error.
unknown
speaker
then
calling
it
a
material...
then
calling
materiality
a
jury
issue
really
has
nothing
behind
it.
unknown
speaker
well,
in
a
tax
fraud...
i
can't
imagine
a
tax
fraud
case
where
that
wouldn't
be
so.
unknown
speaker
but
if
you
adopt
a...
a
rational
juror
test,
i
don't
see
why
that
simply
doesn't
take
you
to
a
sufficiency
of
the
evidence
test
of...
of
a
particularly
stringent
variety.
you're
saying,
as
long
as
the
evidence
is
not
only
sufficient,
but
overwhelming,
that's
enough.
unknown
speaker
are
you
arguing
for
us
to
cut
back
somewhat
on
the
rationale
of
the
sullivan
case?
unknown
speaker
well,
are...
are
you
saying
that
there
are
some
flawed
reasonably
doubt
instructions
that
are
subject
to
harmless
error?
unknown
speaker
so,
you're
isolate...
you're
isolating
harmless
error
from
the
failure
to
instruct
on
an
element?
you're...
you're
taking
the
precise
holding
of
sullivan
and...
and
accepting
that,
but
not
its
reasoning?
i'm
not
quite
sure.
unknown
speaker
and
you
really
think
that
line
makes
a
difference?
do
you
find
that
the
court's
reasonable...
any
reasonable
doubt
instruction
is
really
informative
to
the
jury?
so
that
if...
if
you
don't
give
that
usually,
utterly
uninformative
reasonable
doubt
instruction,
there
has
been
a
total
disaster?
whereas
if
the
jury
doesn't
find
some
elements
of
the
crime,
no
harm
is
done?
i
mean,
that
seems
to
me
a
strange
line.
or...
or
what
we've
approved
as
reasonable
doubt
instructions
are...
are
notoriously
uninformative.
unknown
speaker
sure.
unknown
speaker
well,
one
could,
mr.
mcleese,
expand
on
justice
ginsburg's
point
with
respect
to
materiality
in
the
tax
case
and
materiality
in
fraud,
too.
i
mean,
it's...
it's
rare
that
a
con
man
is
going
to
tell
you
it's
raining
outside
when
it's
sunny.
so,
that
doesn't
make
any
difference.
he's
going
to
make
material
representations.
unknown
speaker
go
ahead.
i
just
have
one...
one
more
question.
it
seems
to
me
that
a
requirement
of
the
kind
that
mr.
rubinstein
was
requesting
is...
is
easier...
rather
easier
for
the
government
to
meet.
i
mean,
you
said
that...
yeah,
there
was
an
error
here.
this
is
an
error
that's
easy
to
see
will
not
happen
again.
is
that...
in...
in
contrast
to
reasonable
doubt,
where
the
end
result,
it
seems
to
me,
you
don't
define
it
at
all,
then
you
won't
define
it
incorrectly.
but
here,
it's
very
easy
for
a
judge
to
give
the
right
charge.
there's
no
administrative
problem
with
meeting
the
requirement.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
but
prospectively,
there's
not
a
problem?
unknown
speaker
well,
he...
i
thought
he
made
a
distinction
between
misdescription
and
taking
the
element
away
from
the
jury
altogether.
unknown
speaker
i
understood
it
that
way,
too.
unknown
speaker
well,
we
normally
interpret
federal
statutes
that
adopt
common
law
offenses
to
incorporate
the
common
law
elements,
don't
we?
unknown
speaker
i
mean
there
is
language
in
several
of
our
opinions
to
that
effect.
and
normally
you
would
think
that
wire
and
mail
fraud,
any
federal
fraud
statute,
would
incorporate
the
notion
of
materiality
as
an
element.
unknown
speaker
how
about
people
who
try
to
make
false
representations
but
don't
succeed?
unknown
speaker
but
that...
see,
that
seems
a
bit
of
a
stretch.
unknown
speaker
i
mean,
that
sounds
like
conspiracy.
unknown
speaker
what
is
your
common
law
precedent
for
the
scheme
to
kill
by
toxic
substances?
that's
the
problem.
there
is
no
common
law
precedent
for
that
kind
of
statute,
is
there?
unknown
speaker
i
suppose--
unknown
speaker
--yes,
but
i
don't...
i
really
still
don't
understand
that.
because
if
the
word
"fraud"
at
common
law
implicitly
included
an
element
of
materiality,
why
wouldn't
a
scheme
to
defraud
include
an
attempt
to
do
something
that
has
materiality?
unknown
speaker
then
you
don't
need
anything
special
in
this
statute.
then
materiality
is
simply
an
element,
like
any
of
the
others...
in
the
bank
fraud
statute,
in
the
federal...
in
the
mail
fraud
statute
and
the
wire
fraud
statute.
if
you
come
across
this
case
that
you're
thinking
of,
which
is
like
picking
the
pocket
of
a
stone
idol...
i
mean
that's
the
example
they
used
to...
can
you
pick
the
pocket
of
a
stone
idol?
that's
my
criminal
law
class
48
and
a
half
years
ago.
[laughter]
but
if
in
fact
that
should
come
about,
the
answer
to
that
law
school
hypothetical
was
no,
he
hasn't
violated
the
statute;
rather,
he's
guilty
of
the
attempt.
and
so...
so,
i
take
it
you're
conceding
that's
the
same
thing
here.
in
which
case,
that's
the
end
of
this
part
of
the
argument,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
is
there
any
reason
why
we
treat
the
element,
materiality,
which
is
hoped
for,
tried
for
but,
through
some
concatenation
of
comets,
fails,
is
there
any
reason
we
would
treat
that
any
differently
than
any
other
element
in
the
statute...
say
the
element,
as
the
chief
justice
just
said,
of...
of
the
false
statement
itself,
which,
through
some
incredible
accident,
turns
out
to
be
true?
unknown
speaker
all
right.
unknown
speaker
all
right.
unknown
speaker
then
you
would
be
satisfied
with
the
following
statement:
that
the
element
of
materiality
in
this
statute
is
there,
it
is
an
element,
and
is
to
be
treated
the
same
way
as
every
other
element
in
the
statute?
unknown
speaker
in
other
words,
you
said
the
others
weren't
actual
either.
i
just
want
to
treat
them
alike.
unknown
speaker
no.
but
the
government
has
to
prove
that
he
intended
to
use
effective
means.
unknown
speaker
so
that,
in
point
of
fact,
he
can
come
in
and
say,
look,
i'm
such
a
bad
con
artist
that
i
was
going
to
tell
him
it
was
raining
when
it
was...
when...
when
the
sun
was
shining,
and
i
thought
that
would
get
me
the
money.
but
the
government
has
still
got
to
allege
and
prove,
i
would
suppose,
on...
on
the
reasoning
that
i
think
you
accept,
that
the
representation
he
meant
to
make
would
have
been
a
material
representation.
unknown
speaker
intend
that
they
be
sufficient
for
his
purpose,
but
not
necessarily
material;
that's
a
fine
line.
unknown
speaker
yeah.
but
assuming
the...
the
deception
may
be
an
implicit
deception,
the
deception
is
disneyland
exists.
that's
material.
unknown
speaker
oh,
they've
all
heard
the
news?
unknown
speaker
well,
mail--
unknown
speaker
--for...
for...
for
wire
fraud,
mail
fraud;
the
thing
that's
transmitted
by
wire
or
through
the
mail
doesn't
have
to
have
any
of
the
elements
of
the
fraudulent
scheme,
does
it?
unknown
speaker
i
mean,
it
just
has
to
be
something
to
accomplish
the
scheme?
unknown
speaker
do
you
take
the
position
that
if
someone
makes
what
would
otherwise
be,
by
everybody's
concession,
a
material
misrepresentation,
but
the
victim,
by
some
idiosyncratic
bit
of
luck,
happens
to
know
that
it
is
untrue,
that
the...
that
the
misrepresentation,
therefore,
is
not
material?
unknown
speaker
why
isn't
that
the
florida
case?
it
just
happens
that
everybody
has
heard
that
the...
that
the
representation,
the
implicit
representation,
that
there
is
a
disneyland,
is...
is
untrue.
it's...
the
world
happens
to
know
it
in
that
case,
but
in
my
hypothetical
the
victim
happens
to
know
it.
in
each
case,
the...
the
representation,
if
true,
would
have
been
material,
and
isn't
that
enough?
unknown
speaker
if
believed...
i'm
sorry...
if
accepted.
unknown
speaker
what
if...
what
if...
what
if
it
isn't
the
materiality
element
that
he's
mistaken
about,
but
the...
but
the
defrauding
element?
he
is
so
stupid
that...
that
in
fact
what
he
does
ends
up
putting
10...
additional
dollars
in
the
pocket
of
the
victim
rather
than
in
his
own
pocket.
he...
you
know--
unknown
speaker
--a
buster
keaton
thing.
unknown
speaker
but...
but
you
say
that
would
be
prosecutable
because
he
did
intend
to
defraud?
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
right.
but--
unknown
speaker
--you're...
you're
consistent.
that's
a
scheme
to
defraud.
unknown
speaker
thank
you,
mr.
mcleese.
mr.
rubinstein,
you
have
2
minutes
remaining.
unknown
speaker
mr.
rubinstein,
what
do
you
say
about...
about
mr.
mcleese's
gold
mine
hypothetical?
unknown
speaker
never
mind
the
materiality,
i'm...
i'm
talking
about
when
in
fact
the
gold
mine
is...
is
a
gold
mine,
and...
and
what
he's
mistaken
about
is...
is
not...
not
the
materiality
but
whether
he's
defrauding.
unknown
speaker
true.
the
statute
is
not
violated?
unknown
speaker
so,
you're
consistent.
[laughter]
but
if
we
didn't
merge
completed
offenses,
i
suppose
we
could
say
the
statute
would
be
violated.
because
the...
the
attempt
made
at
the
time
prior
to
the
discovery
that
there
was
all
this
gold
there
would
survive
and...
and
that...
that
could
be
prosecuted.
unknown
speaker
the
honorable
court
is
now
adjourned
until
tomorrow
at
ten
o'clock.
