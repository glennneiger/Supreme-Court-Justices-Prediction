mr.
carter
g.
phillips
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
government
suggests
to
you
that
the...
this
may
be
a
case
of
high
chevron
or
low
chevron.
i
submit
to
you
that
this
is
a
case
of
no
chevron.
and
the
reason
for
that
is
that
you
cannot
determine
whether
or
not
any
kind
of
deference
is
due
to
the
agency's
interpretation
simply
by
citing
other
statutory
schemes
or
cases
that
interpret
other
statutory
schemes.
in
order
to
decide
in
a
particular
case
whether
or
not
respect
is
due
to
the
regulations
or
interpretations
of
the
particular
agency,
it's
absolutely
essential
to
examine
the
source
of
regulatory
authority,
the
nature
of
the
judicial
proceeding
that
congress
provided
for,
and
in
this
case
take
a
very
hard
look
at
the
regulation
itself
because
it
expresses
as
plainly,
as
anything
can,
the
very
limited
nature
of
the
authority
that
customs
purported
to
exercise
in
this
particular
context.
and
if
you
follow
those
three
sources
of
law,
they
all
point
in
precisely
the
same
direction,
which
is
that
customs
never
has
had,
in
the
200
years
of
its
existence,
the
kind
of
authority
that
the
government
purports
to
claim
that
it
has
now
on
the
basis
of
an
utterly
a
historic
analysis
of
this
particular
problem.
instead,
what
we
know
is
that
customs
binds
its
own
people
at
their
ports
of
entry,
and
that's
all
customs
purports
to
do.
it
does
not
purport
to
bind
either
this
court
or
the
court
of
international
trade
or
the
importer
when
it
adopts
regulations
such
as
section
10.16
that's
at
issue
in
this
case.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
it
does
need
to
go
through
comment
and
notice
rulemaking
when
it
adopts
a
regulation
pursuant
to
headnote
11
which
provides
the
procedures
with
regard
to
the
admission,
okay,
that's
applicable
to
this
particular
kind
of
case.
the
procedures
with
regard
to
admission
are
things
like
inspections,
what's
required
to
inspect
to
make
a
determination
with
regard
to
the
classification.
that
is
a,
quote,
substantive
rule.
it's
procedural
in
nature,
but
it
is
a
delegation
of
authority
and
it
does
require
the
notice
and
comment
rulemaking
because
you
have
to
comply
with
those
specific
procedures
in
headnote
11
in
order
to
be
allowed
to
make
a
protest
that's
valid
under
the
statute.
but
with
respect
to
the
rest
of
the
rules,
it's
absolutely
clear
they
were
not
intended
to
be
substantive
rules
or
in
any
way
to
bind
anybody,
and
that's
because
customs
doesn't
have
the
authority
to
do
that.
and...
and
that
is
as
clear
as
can
be.
i
think
it's
as
clear
as
can
be
in
the...
the
sentence
in
section
10.11
of
the
regulation.
but
if
you
read
section
10.11
in
context
of
the
comments--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--i'm
sorry,
mr.
chief
justice.
section
10.11
is
on
page
36
of
our
brief,
and
it
says,
nothing
in
these
regulations
purports
or
is
intended
to
restrict
the
legal
right
of
importers
or
others
to
a
judicial
review
of
the
matters
contained
therein.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
the
notion
that
what
this
regulation
is
really
talking
about
is
simply
to
prevent
all
judicial
review
is...
is
inconsistent
with
the
nature
of
the
comments
that
were
made.
no
one
criticized
the
comments
because
they
would
foreclose
judicial
review.
everyone
criticized
the
comments
because
they
purported
to
exercise
substantive
rulemaking
authority
that
the
agency
did
not
have,
and
the
agency
somewhat
inartfully
said,
no,
no,
no,
we
didn't
mean
to
intend
anything
along
those
lines.
and
that's
a
perfectly
rational
understanding
of
both
their
authority
and
the
nature
of
the
responses
that
they
made
to
the...
to
the
comment.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
but
the...
the
other
alternative
interpretation
is
that
it's
utterly
superfluous,
that
is,
that...
that
the
ir...
i
mean...
excuse
me...
that
customs
decided
to
tell
the
world
that
it
was
not
going
to
foreclose
judicial
review.
but
everyone
knows
that
agencies
don't
have
the
authority
to
foreclose
judicial
review
particularly
in
a...
in
a
statutory
scheme
like
this
which
provides
for
de
novo
judicial
review.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
that
is
the
argument
that
we
make,
yes,
your
honor.
i
believe
that
is--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--i
think
that
is
the
clearest
evidence
that
congress
did
not
mean
to
have
issues
decided
in
the
first
instance
by
a
particular
agency.
i
think
it's
clear
under
those
circumstances
that
the
enforcement...
the
ultimate
enforcement
of
the
statute
is
something
that
congress
expected
the
judiciary
to
undertake.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
since
the
ultimate
question
really
is
one
of...
of
congressional
intent--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--i
could
imagine
a
situation
in
which
congress
had
expressed
itself
in
a
way
that
it
meant
for
the
de
novo
review
to
be
limited
to
the
facts
and
in
a
way
that
would
allow
the
contrary
inference.
i
just
think
that
when
all
we
know
is
that
congress
has
acted
in
the
way
it
did
is
the
de
novo
review
mechanism...
the
stronger
inference
obviously
is
that
it
meant
for
these
matters
not
to
be
dealt
with
as
a
matter
of
chevron
deference.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
i
don't
think
that's
the
natural
inference
to
draw
from
that
kind
of
extraordinary
scope
of...
of
judicial
proceeding.
and
so...
i
mean,
you
can
reach
an
opposite
inference,
but
i
think
you...
i
would...
i
would
at
least
look
for
clearer
evidence
that
congress
really
meant
for
some
deference
to
arise
in
a
situation
where
congress
has
so
clearly
indicated
that
it
wants
de
novo
review.
and
there
are
two
aspects
of
this
case
that
make
that
seem
to
me
unbelievably
powerful.
one,
you
know,
the
government
doesn't
mention
section
2638
which
in
my
experience
is
a
remarkable
provision.
let
me
see
if
i
can
find
it.
2638
is
mentioned
in
our
brief
again
at...
oh,
at
2a
of
the...
2a
of
the
respondent's
brief.
and
2638
specifically
says
that
the...
that
customs
is...
is...
you
don't
even
have
to
make
the
presentation
to
customs
in
order
to
preserve
your
right
to
protest;
that
is,
you
don't
have
to
make
the
same
argument--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--i'm
sorry.
i
may
have...
i
may
have
misspoken.
i
apologize.
you're
right.
it
is
20a.
i'm
sorry.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
i
misread
the
0.
in
section
20a,
where
we
talk
about
section
2638,
it's
an
extraordinary
provision
because
it
says
all
you
need
to
do
is
present
the
fact
that
you
protest
and
that's
sufficient
to
justify
allowing
you
to
go
to
court
to
challenge
it.
that
means
that
you
can
present
one
set
of
arguments
to
the
customs
and
a
completely
different
set
of
arguments
to
the
court,
and
the
court
reviews
those
de
novo.
and
it
seems
to
me
an
extraordinary
concept
that
i
could...
you
know,
i
could
completely
mislead
customs.
they
would
reach
a
result
that
might
be
reasonable
on
the
basis
of
what
i
present,
and
then
i
start
all
over
again
de
novo.
obviously,
you
can't
be
deferring
to
the
customs'
decision
in
the
specific
case.
and
therefore,
it
seems
quite
unlikely
that
congress
would
have,
in
that
kind
of
a
scheme,
intended
to
allow
customs
regulations
which
just
generally
inform
the
customs
agents
how
to
proceed,
what
the
law
is,
and
that
that
is
in
some
sense
binding
on
either
importers
or
on
the...
or
on
the...
or
on...
or
on
the
courts.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
i
think
that's
a
gross
overstatement,
that
the
agency
rules
are
nullified.
i
mean,
i
understand
that's
the
solicitor
general's
position,
but
if
you
read
the
court
of
international
trade
and
the
federal
circuit's
opinions,
they
analyzed
the
rule
and
said
they
thought
it
was
inconsistent
with
the
statute.
and
then
in
the
next
paragraph
of
their
analysis,
they
turn
to
the
question
of
whether
or
not
it
is
entitled
to
chevron
deference,
which
i
took
to
be
the
fullest
form
of
it,
and
said--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--no.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
no,
but
they...
but
they
reviewed
it
in
two
different
ways.
they...
they...
because
the...
the
court
of
international
trade
and
the
federal
circuit
have
always
been
willing
to
give
what
i
would
regard
as
skidmore
deference
to
whatever
customs
does.
they
read
it
for
what
it's
worth
and
they
accept
it
for
what
value
it
has
in
terms
of
helping
them
to
decide
a
case.
they
have
never
been
willing
to
give
chevron
deference
for
the...
for
all
of
the
reasons
that
i've
identified.
one,
the
statutory
scheme
is
not
one
that...
that
lends
itself...
it
is
a
very
de
novo
review
proceeding
and
has
been
for
the...
for
the
entirety
of
200
years.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
i
don't
think
so.
where...
where
the
court
sought...
i
mean,
where
congress
sought
clear
uniformity
was
by
creating
the
court
of
international
trade
and
allowing
the
specialized
court
to
set
it.
it
did,
indeed,
try
to
have
a
second
level
of
administrative
uniformity
because
there
was
a
problem
in
the
relationship
between
the
customs
houses
and
the
commissioners
of
customs
at
one
time
and
the
secretary
of
treasury,
which
is
why
1502
is...
is...
is
an
extraordinary
provision.
it
says,
the
secretary
shall
act
in
a
particular
way
and
customs
shall
follow
the
instructions.
that's
not
an
accident.
that's
a
function
of
a...
of
a
division
of
power
between
the
secretary
and
the...
and
the
port
commissioners.
and
congress
stepped
into
that
void
and
said,
no,
no,
no,
it's
important
for
at
least
initial
administrative
consistency
to
insist
that
treasury
says
what
the
customs
officers
shall
do
and
they
will
do
what
treasury
says.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
yes.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
to
be
sure
as
a
matter
of--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--in
general,
you'd
hope
not,
justice
scalia.
on
the
other
hand,
it
was
reasonably
clear
that
customs
commissioners
viewed
themselves
as
presidential
appointees
with
a
significant
amount
of
independent
authority.
and
as
a
consequence
of
that,
congress
stepped
in.
this
is
an
historic
anomaly.
i
don't...
i
don't
know
of
any
other
agency
where
that's
true,
but
i
don't
know
of
any
other
agency
that's
like
customs
with
respect
to
almost
any
other
aspect
of
this,
which
is
why
i
think
it's
a
fundamental
mistake
to
look
to
other
agencies
to
try
to
determine
what
authority
customs
has.
yes,
justice
breyer.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
no,
that
proposition
is
incorrect.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
because
it
is
the
president
and
the...
and
the...
and
the
u.s.
trade
representative
and
the
international
trade
commission
that
serve
the
policy
making
role
vis-a-vis
congress
and
vis-a-vis
the
rest
of
the
world.
and
part
of
that's
the
reason
for
the
harmonized
tariff
schedule
is
because
it's
important
to
be
able
to
reconcile
our
tariff
arrangements
with
tariff
arrangements
in
other
countries.
and
that's
done
at
a
very
high
policy
level.
and
that's
why...
not
only
is
it...
is
it
that
congress
would
turn
to
them
in
seeking
guidance
on
how
to
proceed,
but
more
fundamentally
congress
has
delegated
extraordinary
authority
to
the
president
to
modify
these
tariff
schedules
as...
as
necessary,
either
as
a
matter
of
efficiency
or
as
a
matter
of
dealing
with
international
affairs.
and...
and
when
you
get
the
description
of
what's
going
to
happen
in...
in
response
to
the
harmonized
tariff
schedule,
you
get
these
majestic
statements
about
the
u.s.
trade
rep
and
the
president
and
then
it
turns
to
the
customs
service,
and
the
customs
service
is
supposed
to
send
instructions
to
its
people
on
what
to
do.
it's
clear
that
customs
was
not
viewed
as
a
policy
making
entity--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--yes.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
you
mean
back
in
the--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--in
the
19th
century?
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
my
guess
is
they
would
have
turned
to
the...
to
the
commissioner
of
the
port
authority
of
new
york,
as
well
as
to
the
secretary
of
treasury,
because
these
people
independently
seem
to
be
acting.
and
that's
why
congress
had
to
pass
a
law
in
1502
that
specifically
said,
no,
we're
going
to
order
these
things
in
a
particularized
fashion,
and
they
did
so.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
right.
the
difference...
there
are
a
couple
differences.
one
is
that
there
is
no
counterpart
to
2638
with
respect
to
the...
to
the
irs.
you
must
present
the
precise
grounds
upon
which
you
choose
to
protest
tax...
a
tax,
or
otherwise
you
are
barred.
that's
the
variance
doctrine.
it's
been
decided
by
this
court
since
1940.
there...
so,
there
is
a
vast
difference
in
the
regulatory
scheme
between
treasury
and
customs,
and
it's...
in
terms
of
de
novo
review.
and
i
think
it's
important
to
recognize
that
2638
is
a
remarkably
broad
grant
of
authority
that...
that
distinguishes
treasury
from
customs.
and...
and,
you
know,
the
solicitor
general
in
his
reply
brief
saying
that
they
were
placed
on
a
par
is
just
simply
wrong.
there
is
no
statutory--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--right.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
i'll--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--well,
the...
there
has
been
some
lower
court
decisions
dealing
with
deference
under
those
circumstances.
my
argument
would
be,
i
think,
that
that's...
those
probably
are
wrong,
but
that's
not
an
issue
for
this
case.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
yes,
your
honor.
i
think
they
are
covered
by
precisely
the
same
statutory
scheme.
and
so
you
have...
and
let
me
go
back
to
the
rulemaking
authority
because
i
think
it's
very
important
to
understand
under
1502.
not
only
does
it
only...
i
mean,
that
language
at
the
ports
of
entry
is
terribly
pivotal
language,
and
it...
and
it
goes
back
to
the
distinction
of
the
zenith
case
that
mr.
jones
made
a
great
deal
about
in
his...
in
his
argument.
if
you
look
at
the
zenith
opinion,
the
court
says
in
zenith,
it
describes
the
grant
of
regulatory
authority
and
it's
a
broad
authority
to
deal
with
all
duties.
but
you
know
what's
missing
in
the
language
of
the
zenith
opinion
is
any
reference
to
the
ports
of
entry,
and
the
reason
for
that
is
clear,
is
because
the
grant
of
authority
in
countervailing
duties
cases,
even
in
1979,
was
significantly
broader.
and
then
in
the
1980
statute,
we
have
this
extraordinary
de
novo
review
that's
provided
with
respect
to
customs
in
the
classification
context,
and
congress
then
dealt
with
the
countervailing
duties,
consistent
with
this
court's
decision
in
zenith,
and
said
that
that's
based
on
an
administrative
record
and
that
that's
based
on...
on
ordinary
standards
of
administrative
review.
so,
congress,
even
with
respect
to
customs...
i
want
to
be
clear
about
this
because
one
of
the
things
the
government
challenges
us
on
is
that
somehow
we
are
saying
that
customs,
as
an
entity,
is
divested
of
any
kind
of...
of
respect
or
deference
as
a
consequence
of
our
decision...
of
our
arguments
here.
and
nothing
could
be
further
from
the
truth.
again,
i
think
you
have
to
look
at
the
three
sources
of...
of
information
with
respect
to
what
congress
intended.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
i
think
it's
an
odd
notion
to
say
that
how
you
take
your
regulation
and
apply
it
to
a
specific
case
is
a
decision
that
the
courts
will
utterly
ignore.
and
yet,
how
you
adopt
an
abstract
rule
in
a
particular
context
should
in
some
sense
be
binding
in
a
legislative
fashion.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
that
would
be...
i
would
think
that
more
persuasive.
and...
and
it
seems
to
me
that
the
only
point
that
that
goes
to
is
the
extent
to
which
de
novo
review
in
some
sense
divests
this
regulatory
scheme
and
the
regulations
of
their
authority.
it
still
doesn't
answer
what
i...
what
i
regard
as
the
more...
the
continuing
and
fundamental
problem,
which
is
congress
never
delegated
to
customs
the
authority
to
adopt
regulations
that
it
intended
to
be
binding
in
making
these
kinds
of
substantive
determinations.
and
that
is
precisely
what
section
1502
says
by
saying
those
regs
are
limited
to
the
ports
of
entry,
and
it's
the
same
thing
when
you
look
at
the...
at
the
harmonized
tariff
schedule
because...
i'm
sorry.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
i
think
it
is
more
the
latter
than
it
is
the
former.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
perhaps
mr.
jones
would
be
in
a
better
position
to
give
you
a
broader
based
assessment
of
what
customs
hearings
are
about,
but--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--yes,
i
would...
i
would
expect--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--oh,
i'm...
i'm
sure
there
are
lots
of
disputes
that
raise
lots
of
factual
questions.
that's
why
there's
a
significantly
large
number
of
customs
officers
out
there,
and
presumably
they're
keeping
themselves
well
occupied.
so,
i
don't...
i
don't
have
any
doubt
about
that.
i
think
the...
the
nature
of
the
process
is,
however,
extremely
informal
and
tends
to
move
quite
rapidly,
and
then
in
somewhat
contrast
to
the
judicial
proceedings
which
are
somewhat
more...
obviously,
more
formal
as
a
process
matter
but
are
not
particularly
complicated
given
that
this
is
a
routinized
process--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--right.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
what...
what
it
says,
at
least
to
me...
it
seems
an...
illogical
to
say
that
we
have
a
set
of
rules
and
the
agency
acts
pursuant
to
those
rules
and
makes
a
decision.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
but
that
decision
could
have
been
based
on
completely
the
wrong...
everything
could
be
wrong
about
that--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--because
you
didn't
have
to
raise
the
argument.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
right.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
it's...
it's
very
much
the
same
question
justice
kennedy
asked
me,
and
obviously
i'm
not
being
as
persuasive
as
i'd
like
to
be.
but
my--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--now,
i'm
really
unhappy.
[laughter]
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
oh,
i
think
to
define
precisely
the
breadth
of
the...
of
the
de
novo
review.
otherwise
you
would
assume--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--but...
but,
see,
the
difference
is
that
if
you
go
back
to
the...
to
the
example
that
the
solicitor
general
points
to,
which
is
review
of
irs
protests,
you
have
to
identify
the
precise
grounds
and
you
are
stuck
with
the
precise
grounds
that
you've
identified.
all
i'm
saying
is
that
this...
this
is
to
my
mind
the
broadest,
perhaps
the
most
breathtaking,
de
novo
proceeding
that
i
know
about.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
there's
two
answers
to
that.
one
is
the
inference
to
draw
when
congress
creates
an
entire
scheme
of
de
novo
review
is
that
it
does
not
look
to
the
enforcing
agency
as
the
source
of
uniformity.
and
then,
two,
when
you
get
to
the...
the
genuine
source
of
uniformity
in
this
particular
statutory
scheme,
we
know
that
it's
the
court
of
international
trade
because
it
is
a
specialized
court.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
oh,
to
be
sure,
and
of
this
court--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--that's...
that's
clearly
the
case
and
that's
the
fair
inference
you'd
draw
from
the...
from
the
statutory
scheme
congress
has
created
of...
of
appellate
review.
but
the
question
is,
what
inference
do
you
draw
from
a
scheme
of
extraordinary
de
novo
review
coupled
with
a
remarkably
narrow
grant
of
rulemaking
authority?
and
let's
remember,
there
are
five
provisions
that
were
cited
in
the
adoption
of
these
regulations,
and
each
one
of
them
points
to
the
ability
to
bind
customs
or
to
bind
individual
employees
of
the
particular
service.
and
the
government
only
discusses
essentially
1502
and,
in
doing
that,
reads
out
of
the
statute
ports
of
entry,
that
language,
which
i
submit
to
you
is
terribly
important.
and
then
when
you
get
to
the
regulation--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--if
you
contrast
that
language,
justice
ginsburg,
to
the
language
in
zenith,
the
grant
of
authority
in
zenith,
you
would
say
the
same
thing
there,
but
the
term,
ports
of
entry,
isn't
included
in
the
grants
of
authority
to
deal
with
countervailing
duties.
those
presumably
arise
as
well
at
the
ports
of
entry,
just
like
every
other
duty
arises
there.
the
fact
that
congress
put
that
language
in
there
was
terribly
important
to--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--well,
it
may
not
have
been
observed
in
part
because
i
don't
think
the
issue
of...
of
deference
arose...
was
briefed
in
zenith.
and
if
you
just
look
at
the
sources
of
authority
that
the
court
looked
to
in
passing,
it
said
that
this
is
an
ordinary
administrative...
judicial
review
and
administrative
proceeding,
which
is
one
in
which
you
would
routinely
grant
deference,
and
second,
it
described
the...
the
authority
conferred
upon
treasury
in...
in
terms
that
are
significantly
broader
than
the
terms
that
are
employed
in
this
particular
case.
i
submit
to
you
that
zenith
simply
does
not
help
to
get
to
the
right
result
in
this
particular
case.
again,
i'd
like
to
go
back
to
the
regulation
because
i
think
to
my
mind
what
is
extraordinary
about
this
case
is
the
way
all
the
parts
fall
together.
this
is
remarkably
broad
de
novo
review
judicial
proceedings.
it
is
remarkably
narrow
grant
of
authority,
and
customs,
in
1974
at
the
pivotal
time,
recognized
in
response
to
a
very
pointed
set
of
comments
that
it
was
not
exercising
the
kind
of
authority
to
which
chevron
deference
would
be
applied.
i
guess
i
go
back
to
my
initial
point.
this
is
not
high
deference...
or
high
chevron
or
low
chevron.
this
is
no
chevron.
i'm
inclined
to
rest
on
our
briefs--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--that's
true.
i
could
address
the
substantive
regulation,
but
if...
if
there
are
no
questions,
i'm
inclined
to
rest
on
the
briefs.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
they
would
certainly
have
a...
a
stronger
argument,
although
i...
i
think
the
more
compelling
arbitrariness
of
this
regulation
arises
in
the
different
treatment
of
the
pants
that
haggar
has
itself
because
they
have
one
set
of
pants
that
come
in
chemically
treated
from
the
united
states
that
are
pressed
and
then
receive
a
permanent
press
as
a
consequence
of
that,
and
another
pair
of
pants
that
are
pressed
and
then
baked
and
are
both
treated
in
the
same
way.
and
those
get
absolutely
contrary
treatment
under
this
particular
regulation.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
i
guess
it
goes
to
the...
to
the
validity
of
a...
of
a
regulation
that...
that
tries
to
use
the
term
permapressing
which
is
i
think
not
a
self-defining
concept
and
one
that
doesn't
seem
to
provide
much
help
in
terms
of
how
to
resolve
any
specific
case.
and...
and
indeed,
i...
i
would
read
that
one
paragraph
of
the
federal
circuit's
analysis
of
the
permapressing
regulations
as
just
saying,
look,
this
is
inconsistent
with
the
statute.
the
statute
tells
us
incidental
to
assembly
is
a
comparative
process.
we
use
the
mast
factors.
we
always
engage
in
individualized
decision
making.
we
ought
to
treat
the
permapressing
process
the
same
way
we
treat
the
painting
process.
it's
all
a
presumption
but
it's
not
categorical.
there
are
no
irrebuttable
presumptions
embodied
here,
and
if
it
does
that--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--well,
except
that
if
the
cost
of
the
assembly
process
is...
of
the
incidental
parts...
incidental...
of
the
parts
that
aren't
the
assembly
process
are
expensive,
as
in
a
case
like
general
motors
or
chrysler,
then...
then
you
would
bar
it
under
those
circumstances
and
you'd
say
it's
not
incidental
because
it's
not
a
minor
operation.
it
is
at
that
point
a
significant
operation.
but
that
is
precisely
what
mast
is
designed
to
get
at
and
that
is
precisely
why
you
don't
need
a
regulation
here.
you
just
need
consistent
application
of
the
analysis
the
federal
circuit
has
devised
and
to
be
applied.
and
it
was
applied
properly
in
this
context.
the
government
doesn't
contest
it
on
that
basis,
and
accordingly,
the
court
should
affirm.
if
there
are
no
further
questions.
