unknown
speaker
well,
is...
are
these
supposed
to
be
interpretive
regulations
or
legislative
regulations?
unknown
speaker
all
right,
then
if
that's
the
case,
then
what
they
have
is
the
power
to
persuade
but
not
the
power
to
control.
unknown
speaker
all
right.
then
we
should
simply
look
are...
what
they
thought
was
are
they
persuasive.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
mean,
you'd
think...
if...
if
it's
an
interpretive
regulation
and
therefore
it
has
the
legal
force
that...
whatever
is
given
to
the
power
to
persuade,
though
not
the
power
to
control.
when
you
have
an
expert
body
like
the
treasury
that
knows
a
lot
about
it,
you
would
give
a
lot
of
deference.
except,
if
you
were
an
expert
body
that
knew
just
as
much
about
it,
then
why
would
they
have
some
special
power
to
persuade?
unknown
speaker
mr.
jones,
did
you
agree
with
the
premise
that...
that
for
interpretive
regulations,
we
accord
the
agency
only
the
power
to
persuade
and
not
to
control?
i...
i
thought
we--
unknown
speaker
--the
power
to
control
so
long
as
it
was...
it's
within
the
range
of
the
ambiguity.
and
even
if
we
thought
that
another
interpretation
might
be
better,
we
would
go
along
with
the
agency.
is--
unknown
speaker
--bicker,
because
i
think--
unknown
speaker
--it's
crucial
to
this.
[laughter]
i
think
it's
crucial
to
the
disposition
of
this
case
really.
unknown
speaker
but
what
is
it
precisely?
because
you
have
used
chevron
in
your
briefs,
and
then
you
cite
national
muffler--
unknown
speaker
--which
is
not
quite
chevron.
and
then
justice
breyer
brought
up
interpretive
regulations,
which
sounds
to
me
like
skidmore.
so,
which
kind
of
which
degree
of
deference
is
it?
unknown
speaker
i
didn't
understand
all
that,
mr....
this
is
a
much
more
difficult
enterprise
than
i
had
ever
imagined.
there
are
three
chevrons?
unknown
speaker
i
really
had
thought
there
was...
i
had
really
thought
there
was
just
one,
and
i
thought
skidmore
was
pre-chevron
and
speaks
from
an
era
that...
that
simply
bygone.
i...
i--
unknown
speaker
--at
any
rate,
are
you
saying
that
the
interpretive...
the
authority
of
the
treasury
in
this
customs
area
is
identical
to
its
authority
in
the
internal...
for
the
internal
revenue
code?
unknown
speaker
mr.
jones,
suppose
you
had
a
statute
that
said
in
so
many
words
the
court
shall
decide
the
question
de
novo.
unknown
speaker
might
not...
might
not
the...
the
respondent's
disposition
apply
in
that
situation?
unknown
speaker
well,
zenith
radio...
they
talked
about
administrative
practice,
as
i
recall.
unknown
speaker
and...
and
this...
that's
somewhat
different
than
an
interpretive
regulation.
unknown
speaker
it
may
be...
it
may
be
that
this
is
an
even
stronger
case--
unknown
speaker
--i
assume
that
you
would
argue,
but
there
is
a
difference.
unknown
speaker
can
i
ask
you
one
quick
question
about
that?
this
is
something
i
don't
know
the
answer
to.
but
the
treasury,
of
course,
is
in
charge
of
our
tax
laws,
and
basically
when
you
write
a
new
law,
the
first
place
congress
gets
the
law
from
is
the
treasury.
they
run
right
over.
they're
talking
to
each
other.
they're...
they're
part
of
the
legislative
process.
now,
is
treasury
in
the
same
relationship
to
the
customs
laws?
because
from
reading
this,
i
had
the
impression
there's
the
gatt
in
there.
there
are
special
trade
reps
and...
does
treasury
take
part
in
the
creation
of
the
law--
unknown
speaker
--customs
as
it
does
in
the
law,
say,
income
tax?
unknown
speaker
but
as
a
matter
of
practical
fact,
is
there
like
a
whole
section
of
people
in
the
treasury
whose
job
it
is
to
look
over
the
customs
and
tariff
laws
and
to
propose--
unknown
speaker
--changes
and
do
all
these
things?
you
know
how
they
do
it
in
the
tax
area.
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
and
do
they
do
roughly
the
same
thing
in
respect
to
evaluating
substance
of
laws
and
what
the
proposals
are
and
so
forth
or
not?
see,
their
whole
argument
is--
unknown
speaker
--maybe
we
should
take
evidence
on
this.
do
you
think
we
should
take
evidence
on
how...
how
much
involved
the
agency
is
with
the
enactment
of
the
law?
do
you
think
it
makes
any
difference?
unknown
speaker
do
you
want
us
to
give
more
deference
if
the
agency
is
intimately
involved?
unknown
speaker
mr.
jones,
do
we
also
owe
deference
in
this
area
to
interpretations
by
the
u.
s.
trade
representative
or
by
the
international
trade
commission?
unknown
speaker
so,
if
we
don't
defer
no
these
regs,
we
don't
defer
to
anything,
or
our
court
doesn't
defer.
unknown
speaker
there's
nothing
else
to
defer
to.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
don't
know
what
other
sources
there
would
be
if
it
wasn't
the
commission
or
the
trade
rep.
unknown
speaker
mr.
jones,
on
zenith
radio,
i
think
that
the
respondent
has
said,
well,
that's
for
countervailing
tariff
and
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
classification.
unknown
speaker
would
you...
would
you
comment
on
the...
on
the
final
clause
of
the
introductory
provision
of
the
regulation
which
says
nothing
is--
unknown
speaker
--intended
to
deprive
the
importer
of
the
rights
of
judicial
review?
unknown
speaker
do
you...
under
your
view
is
that
just
surplusage?
unknown
speaker
most
of
the
fcc's
rules
are
interpretive
rules.
are
you...
they're--
unknown
speaker
--are
they
chevron
iii?
i
mean,
i
see
now
why
you're...
why
you're
trying
to
draw
this
distinction
between
legislative
rules
and
interpretive
rules.
i...
i
was
never
aware
that--
unknown
speaker
--that
we
give
greater
deference
to
legislative
rules
than
interpretive
rules.
unknown
speaker
one
paragraph
in
the
court's
opinion
in
chevron?
unknown
speaker
this
is
a...
this
is
a
major
distinction
in
administrative
law
that...
that...
that
we
are
going
to
give
lesser
deference
to
those
rules
of
an
agency
that
are
interpretive
rules.
i
mean,
i--
unknown
speaker
--to
my
mind,
the
force
of
the
fcc
rules,
which
are
almost
entirely
interpretive,
is...
is...
is
no
less
than
the
force
of--
unknown
speaker
--well,
if
it
doesn't
result
in
different
decisions
as
a
practical
matter,
why...
you
know,
why
confuse
us
with
it?
unknown
speaker
do
you
think--
--i'm
sorry.
but
that...
can
chevron...
may
i
ask?
can
chevron,
as
you
refer
to
it,
be
read
in
this
way,
that
the
court
was
describing
as
arbitrary
and
capricious
or
indicating
as
being
arbitrary
and
capricious
whatever
was
outside
the
realm
of
reasonable
interpretation
allowed
by
the
ambiguity
of
the
language,
so
that
it
was
really
engaging
in
two
alternative
formulations?
unknown
speaker
okay,
but
you--
--even
so
it
troubles
me.
what
portions
of...
what
portion
of
chevron
are
you
referring
to?
let
me...
let
me
look
at
it.
justice
stevens
maybe
remembers
it.
i
don't.
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
how
about...
how
about
the
answer
to
my
question?
i...
i
agree
with
you.
i
don't
think
the
case
turns
on
it,
but
you
have
raised
the
distinction.
do
you
think
chevron
is
fairly
read
in...
in
the
way
that
i
suggested
with
arbitrary
and
capricious
being
sort
of
the...
an
alternative
formulation
of
what
is
outside
the...
the
realm
of
reasonable
interpretation?
unknown
speaker
which
is
what?
unknown
speaker
an
unreasonable
interpretation
should
be
sustained
in
the
other
situation.
right?
unknown
speaker
i
can't
either.
that's
why
i
don't...
i
don't
understand.
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
if
i
could--
--you
want
to
get
the
other.
if
you
want,
can
i
ask
you
about
the
other...
about
the
reg
itself?
unknown
speaker
you
don't
have
to
answer
if
you
want
to
make
a
different
point.
but
what's
confusing
me
about
it
is
it
says,
chemical
treatment
of
components,
permapressing.
right.
and
then...
but...
but
the
chemicals
evidently
were
inserted
in
the
united
states.
unknown
speaker
and...
and
so,
does
this
reg
mean
that
if
you
have
two
pairs
of
trousers,
company
a
puts
chemicals
in
it
and
company
b
doesn't.
they
send
both
to
mexico.
and
then
in
mexico
what
happens
is
an
identical
thing
to
both:
they
put
it
in
a...
in
a
press
and
they
press
it
just
like
that,
and
they
send
it
back.
does
it
mean
that
the
one
company
pays
and
the
other
doesn't?
unknown
speaker
what
is
just
what
i
said.
they
took
both
pairs
of
trousers,
they
put
it
in
an
iron,
and
they
ironed
it.
in
the
one,
because
there
were
chemicals,
that
led
to
permapressing;
in
the
other,
it
didn't.
so,
they're
treated
identically.
now,
is
there
a
difference
or
not
a
difference?
unknown
speaker
all
right.
so,
now
then,
i
wonder
is
this
reg
rational.
unknown
speaker
because
how
can
it
be
that...
that...
that
when
you
do
exactly
identical
things
to
the
two
pairs
of
trousers,
all
you
did
was
put
them
in
a
press
and
you
pressed
them
like
that--
unknown
speaker
--but
what
about
the
split
that's
involved?
i
mean,
if...
if
all
of
the
whole...
whole
permapressing
operation
were
done
in
mexico,
then
it
would
seem
to
fit
within
the
regulation
purposes.
unknown
speaker
but
the--
unknown
speaker
--the
chemical
process
occurred
in
the
united
states,
didn't
it?
unknown
speaker
the
statute
allows
painting--
unknown
speaker
--and
calls
it
incidental.
this,
you
know,
seems...
seems
to
me
more
incidental
than
painting.
unknown
speaker
i
don't
know
what
i'm
supposed
to
know
about
this,
but--
unknown
speaker
--of
course,
this...
this
current
issue...
is
that
an
issue
of
the
validity
of
the
regulation?
unknown
speaker
or
is
that
an
issue
of
the
application
of
the
regulation--
unknown
speaker
--to
these
facts?
unknown
speaker
that's
not
the...
is
that
the
issue
that
we
have?
unknown
speaker
why...
why
is...
i
mean,
the
chemical...
it
says
chemical,
treatment
of
permapressing.
unknown
speaker
it
doesn't
say
anything
in
the
reg
about
the
chemical
treatment
taking
place
in
mexico,
but
it
does
use
the
example
of
permapressing.
unknown
speaker
so,
your
interpretation,
which
is
treasury's
interpretation,
is
a
general
interpretation
of
the
reg.
unknown
speaker
if
the
permapressing...
it
isn't
this
case.
it's...
it's
true
across
the
board.
unknown
speaker
very
well,
mr.
jones.
mr.
phillips,
we'll
hear
from
you.
unknown
speaker
but,
mr.
phillips,
an
agency
certainly
doesn't
have
to
go
through
notice
and
comment
rulemaking
in
order
to
bind
it's
own
people.
it
just
issues
instructions.
unknown
speaker
well,
where
do
we
find
these,
mr.
phillips?
unknown
speaker
well,
the
government
is
not
trying
to
foreclose
judicial
review.
unknown
speaker
it
certainly
is
clumsily
put
if
that's
what
they...
that's
what
they
had
in
mind.
unknown
speaker
may
i...
may
i
ask
you
sort
of
a
broad
question?
i
understand
you
say
it's
neither
high
chevron
nor
low
chevron;
it's
no
chevron.
and
you
don't
have
to
tell
us
whether
you
think
there
is
a
high
and
a
low
chevron
under
your
approach
to
the
case.
but
it
is
your...
is
it
your
view
that
every
statute
that
provides
for
de
novo
review
is
a
no
chevron
case?
unknown
speaker
so,
the
mere
fact
that
they
provide
for
de
novo
review,
that's
the
end
of
the
ball
game
for
you.
unknown
speaker
and
you
don't
think
there
could
be
a
category
of
cases
in
which
the
facts
would
be
reviewed
de
novo,
but
there
would
be
some
degree,
whether
low,
high,
intermediate,
some
degree
of
deference
to
the
agency's
view
of
the
law.
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
isn't
it
equally
clear
that
congress
can
specify
that
there
will
be
de
novo
review,
including
de
novo
review
of
rulings
of
law
in
a
given
case,
without
thereby
implying
anything
about
what
would
be
a
proper
source
of
determining
what
the
proper...
what
the
correct
law
is,
i.e.,
without
in
any
way
implicating
that
there
should
not
be
deference
in...
in
looking
to
agency
regulations
in
making
the
ruling
for?
unknown
speaker
on
2a
of
your
brief,
i
don't
find
the
section
that
you're
referring
to.
unknown
speaker
thank
you.
unknown
speaker
why
doesn't
that...
why
doesn't
that
just
prevent...
present
the
kind
of
situation
that
justice
souter
alluded
to?
you...
you
continue
to
acknowledge
that
the
agency's
rules
are
one
source
of
law,
but
if
the...
if
the
person
challenging
the...
the
assessment
wants
to
appeal
to
another
source
of
law,
he's...
he's
entitled
to
bring
forward
whatever
he
wants.
i
don't
see
why
that
provision
necessarily
says
that
agency
rules
are
nullified
in...
in
this...
in
this
proceeding.
unknown
speaker
well,
it's
never
entitled--
unknown
speaker
--to
chevron
deference
if
it's
inconsistent
with
the
statute,
i
mean,
if
that's
what
you're
saying.
unknown
speaker
but
the
situation
that
you
describe
where
the
importer
can
make
entirely
new
arguments
in
the
court
seems
to
me
to
argue
for
the
necessity
for
the
uniformity
that
would
be
attained
by
following
the...
the
regulations
of
the
agency.
unknown
speaker
congress
has
to
say
that?
unknown
speaker
why...
why
would
congress
have
to
say
that?
isn't...
isn't
the
customs
department
under
the
authority
of
the...
of
the
secretary
of
the
treasury?
unknown
speaker
are
we
going
to
have
a
special
law
in
every
department
that
the
employees
of
that
department
shall
obey
the...
the
secretary?
unknown
speaker
proposition.
congress,
in
legislating...
in
legislating
the
substance
of
tariff
legislation,
looks
to
treasury,
namely
customs,
in
the
same
way
that
congress,
when
enacting
income
tax
legislation,
looks
to
treasury,
namely
the
bureau
of
internal
revenue.
that's
the
proposition.
is
that
true
or
false?
unknown
speaker
all
right.
now,
explain
to
me
in
what
way
that's
incorrect.
unknown
speaker
i...
i
saw
that
too.
i
see
that
now.
i
see
your
argument
definitely
now.
if
we
go
back
to
the
time
when
being
a
port...
was
he
called
a
customs
collector?
a
port...
i
don't
know.
a
customs
collector
was
a
major
political
appointment.
unknown
speaker
i
mean,
a
hugely
important
job
at
that
time,
say,
in
the
19th
century
or
earlier.
who
else
could
congress
have
looked
to
other
than
treasury
as...
for
advice
about
what
the
substance
of...
of
treasury
regulation...
of
customs
regulation
should
have
been?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
yes,
19th
century.
unknown
speaker
on
the
one
hand,
you
describe
an
agency
that
has
such
extraordinary
independence
that
they
have
to
be
told
to
follow
regulations
through
notice
and
comment,
and
on
the
other,
you
say
they
have
no
policy
making
authority.
so,
this
is
a...
from
both
aspects,
a
truly
extraordinary
agency
that
has
notice
and
comment
rulemaking
just
binding
on
the
people
who
work
there,
the
employees,
and
yet,
on
the
other
hand,
it
certainly
is
unusual.
but
with
respect
to
the
expert...
i
think
you
said
congress
set
up
the
expert
tribunal,
the
court
of
international
trade.
well,
congress
set
up
a
tax
court
too,
and
the
tax
court
does
give
deference,
even
if
they
call
it
national
muffler
instead
of
chevron.
they
do
give
deference
to
treasury
regulations.
unknown
speaker
does
2638
have
nothing
to
do
with
appraisals?
you
say
that
as
distinguished
from
classification
where
the
agency
gets
no
deference--
unknown
speaker
--they
do
get
deference
when
it
comes
to
appraisals?
is
that--
unknown
speaker
--setting
the
value
of
the
goods.
unknown
speaker
so,
you
think
the
same
thing
goes
for
appraisals
as
for
classifications.
unknown
speaker
why...
why...
why
is
it
that
because
there's
no
administrative
record
in
the
scheme
we
are
reviewing
here,
that
the
secretary
is
entitled
to
no
deference
as
to
the
regulations?
it
seems
to
me
those
are
two
very
different
things.
unknown
speaker
well,
it
seems
to
me
that
this
is
a
case
where
uniformity
is
all
the
more
necessary
and
that
we
should,
therefore,
defer
to
the
regulations
as
the
source
of
law
even
though
in
the
court
of
international
trade
there
will
be
a
de
novo
hearing
on
a
new
record.
at
least
we'll
have
uniformity
as
to
what
the
source
of
law
is.
unknown
speaker
you...
you
just...
how
are
the...
what
are
customs
hearings
of
this
sort
normally
about?
i
mean,
are
customs
hearings
where
there
are
disputes
of
brute
facts
common
or
not?
i
mean,
do
some
people
argue,
no,
i
did
import
a
piece
of
steel
that
looks
like
this,
and
somebody
says,
no,
no,
that
was
not
imported
on
such
and
such
a
day?
or
is
it
that
they
concede
what
the
item
was
and
the
question
is
whether
to...
how
it
fits
within
a
given
tariff?
unknown
speaker
well,
do
we
have
any...
because
if
it's...
i
mean,
i
guess
that's
your
argument.
do
we
have
any
factual
basis?
i
mean,
if
it's
only
the
latter
kind
of
thing,
a
de
novo
hearing
would
be
irrelevant
i
guess
under
the
government's
interpretation
of
the
law,
but
if
it's
a
lot
of
the
latter
thing,
if
it's
a
lot
of
disputes
of
real
brute
facts,
then
i
guess
that
de
novo
would
have
a
big
meaning.
how
do
i
find
out
the
answer
to
that?
what
are
customs
hearings
about?
unknown
speaker
well,
isn't
entirely
possible
that
they
might
involve
factual
inquiry
into
things
like
precisely
what
was
done
in
the
united
states
and
precisely
what
was
done
in
mexico--
unknown
speaker
--as
a
factual
matter.
i
can
imagine
that
there
would
be
a
lot
of
factual
evidence
on
things
of
that
sort,
wouldn't
there?
unknown
speaker
mr.
phillips,
could
you
repeat
your
argument
with
reference
to
2638
for
me?
i'm
not
quite
sure
i
really
understand
your
point.
the
statute,
as
i
understand
it,
says
that
if
you
make
a
protest,
you
can
bring
a
civil
action
under...
under
515,
but
you're
not
limited
in
the
civil
action
to
grounds
of
the
protest
that
you
made
at
the
port
of
entry.
unknown
speaker
now,
why
does
that
have
anything
to
do
with
the
rules
that
should
govern
the
disposition
of
the
civil
action?
that's
what
i
don't
quite
understand.
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
well,
but
they're
two
different
decisions.
unknown
speaker
they're
two
different
decisions.
one
you
make
at
the
port
of
entry.
unknown
speaker
and
you
say,
these
goods
didn't
come
from
mexico;
they
came
from
spain.
and
then
you
later
realize
you're
wrong
and
you
bring
a
suit
and
say,
well,
the
real
problem
was
they
did
the
permapressing
in
mexico
and
i...
i
failed
to
point
that
out.
now,
the
fact
you
can
make
that
argument
in
the
later
proceeding
doesn't
seem
to
me
to
have
anything
to
do
with
the
question
of
whether
a
regulation
that
relates
to
permapressing
shall
be
given
deference.
it
just
seems
to
me
they're
two
entirely
different
ball
games.
unknown
speaker
indeed,
you...
you've
persuaded
me
to
the
contrary.
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
it...
it
seems
to
me
that
if...
if
you're
position
is
right,
2638
is
inexplicable.
if
indeed
it
is
an...
an
entirely
new
determination
not
only
on
the
facts,
but
on
the
law,
if
that's
what
de
novo
review
means,
why
would
you
need
2638?
unknown
speaker
--de
novo.
you
decide
what
the
law
governing
this
thing
is.
unknown
speaker
but
when
you
answered
justice
stevens'
question
and
my
question,
why
isn't
this
a
preeminent
case
for
applying
at
least
a
uniform
source
of
law
on
which
we
can
then
make
a
de
novo
determination
based
on
the
facts?
unknown
speaker
well,
but
the
court
of
international
trade
in
a
case
like...
is
certainly
bound
to
follow
the
decisions,
say,
of
the
federal
circuit,
is
it
not?
unknown
speaker
so,
de
novo
doesn't
mean
you
just
decide
as
an
original
proposition
for
yourself
what
the
law
is
if
other
courts
which
are
above
you
in
the
hierarchy
have
said
differently.
unknown
speaker
but
what
makes
it
so
important?
i
mean,
that's
where
it
happens.
the
goods
come
in
and
they
have
to
be
classified
at
the
port
of
entry.
unknown
speaker
well,
but
your
argument
is...
is
also
that
this
language
is
just
a
reflection
of
a
long
historical
tradition
of
the
distinctiveness
of
the
customs
service
and
whatnot.
that's
quite
inconsistent
with
the
way
we
came
out
in
zenith,
even
though
we
didn't
have
this
statute.
you
assert
that
this
statute
just
reflects
a
long
historical
tradition,
and
in
fact
in
zenith,
it
seems
to
me
that
historical
tradition
was...
was
not
observed.
unknown
speaker
of
course,
in
1974
there
was
no
chevron
then.
that's
clear.
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
well,
one
question
about
that.
would
you...
would
you
reach
the
same
result
if
the
chemical
treatment
also
occurred
in
new
mexico...
i
mean,
in
mexico?
unknown
speaker
well,
that
could
be
a
question
of
the
application
of
the
regulation,
not...
not
whether
permapressing
can't
be
taken
out
from
this--
unknown
speaker
--but
the...
one
of
the
things
about
mast,
the
last
factor
in
that,
seems
that...
that
the
importer
would
always
win
because
it's
always
cheaper
to
do
it
all
someplace
else.
unknown
speaker
thank
you,
mr.
phillips.
mr.
jones,
you
have
3
minutes
remaining.
unknown
speaker
if
we
could
get
down
to
the
last
thing,
if
you
have
just
a
moment
to
it.
unknown
speaker
the
argument
is
in
the
end
you
are
absolutely
absurd
to
make
a
distinction
between
pressing
a
little
longer
and
pressing
and
baking.
unknown
speaker
mr.
jones,
i...
i
wish
you
could
give
me
some...
make
up
some
explanation
for
the
extraordinary
provision
in
the
regulation
that
says,
you
know,
this...
this
will
not
deprive
anyone
of
the
right
to
judicial
review.
unknown
speaker
of
all
of
the
materials
brought
forward
by...
by
the
respondent,
i
really
think
that...
that
is
the
one
that
most
smells
like
what
he
says
this
whole
system
is
set
up
to
do.
unknown
speaker
where
are
we,
mr.
jones?
unknown
speaker
that's
at
page
36
of
the
red
brief.
unknown
speaker
it
says
that
these
regulations
set
forth
interpretive
regulations.
that's
what
the
agency
intended
to
accomplish.
the
last
sentence...
i
think
amicus
customs
and
trade
bar
is
right...
just
reflects
that,
yes,
these
are
interpretive
rules,
not
binding
legislative
rules.
you
have
a
right
to
go
to
court
to
challenge
them.
i
know
my
time
has
run,
but
the
cite
that
you
asked
for,
justice
scalia,
is
467
u.s.
843
to
844.
thank
you.
