justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
this
case
arises
from
a
refund
proceedings
for
duties
imposed
on
men's
garments
that
were
shipped
by
the
respondent
to
this
country
from
an
assembly
plant
that
it
controlled
in
mexico.
what
happens
is
that,
this
manufacturer
was
attempting
to
use
mexican
plants
for
assembly
purposes.
it
shipped
pre-cut
fabrics
to
the
plant
in
mexico
with
threads,
buttons,
and
zippers
and
they
were
assembled
there.
if
that
had
been
all,
they
would
have
been
entitled
to
a
duty
exemption
without
question.
but
the
fabric
had
been
pretreated
with
a
chemical
and
when
the
chemical
is
subjected
to
heat,
it
then
puts
the
permapress
in
the
garments
and
the
baking
and
the
heating
was
also
done
in
mexico
and
the
question
is
whether
or
not
this
is
incidental
to
assembly
or
not?
the
respondent
sought
to
permapress
the
garments
in
order
to
maintain
their
creases,
of
course.
to
accomplish
this,
they
baked
the
chemically
pretreated
garments
at
the
mexican
plant.
the
statute
on
which
the
respondent
relies
does
provide
a
partial
exemption
from
duties,
otherwise
imposed
if
the
articles
assembled
abroad.
i
have
not
been
improved
in
condition
except
by
being
assembled
or
by
being
subjected
to
operations
incidental
to
the
assembly
process.
the
custom
service
claimed
that
the
baking
was
an
added
process
in
addition
to
assembly
and
it
denied
the
duty
exemption.
respondent's
cases
made
more
difficult
by
a
regulation
adopted
by
the
commissioner
of
customs
that
deems
all
permapress
in
operations
not
incidental
to
the
assembly
process.
the
respondent
brought
suit
for
refund
in
the
court
of
international
trade.
the
court
declined
to
treat
the
regulation
as
controlling
and
it
ruled
in
favor
of
the
respondent.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
federal
circuit
affirmed;
it
also
declined
to
give
the
regulations
deference.
contrary
to
the
position
of
that
court
and
the
court
of
appeals,
we
hold
the
regulation
in
question
is
subject
to
the
analysis
required
by
chevron,
usa
and
that
if
it
is
a
reasonable
regulation
and
implementation
of
an
ambiguous
statutory
provision,
it
must
be
given
judicial
deference.
the
statutory
scheme
does
not
support
the
respondent's
contention
that
the
regulation
is
limited
in
application
to
customs
officers
themselves
and
is
not
intended
to
govern
the
adjudications
of
importers'
refund
suits.
in
addition,
nothing
in
the
regulation
in
question
persuade
us
that
the
agency
intended
the
regulation
to
have
some
lesser
force
and
effect.
we
also
reject
the
argument
that
various
statutes
empower
the
court
of
international
trade
to
interpret
the
tariff
statute
without
giving
chevron
deference
to
the
regulations.
we
declined
to
reach
the
question
whether
the
regulation
in
question
does
need
the
preconditions
for
chevron
deference.
respondent's
various
arguments
in
this
respect
are
best
addressed
in
the
first
instance
to
the
courts
below.
justice
stevens
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
part
and
dissenting
in
part
in
which
justice
ginsburg
joins.
