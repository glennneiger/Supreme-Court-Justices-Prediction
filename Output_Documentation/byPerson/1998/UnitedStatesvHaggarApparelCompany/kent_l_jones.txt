mr.
kent
l.
jones
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
1978,
this
court
held
in
the
zenith
radio
case
that
substantial
deference
should
be
given
to
treasury
interpretations
of
the
tariff
act.
in
the
present
case,
the
federal
circuit,
without
even
citing
zenith
radio,
held
precisely
to
the
contrary
and
concluded
that
no
deference
should
be
given
to
treasury
interpretation.
the
court
concluded
that
a
1980
statute
directed
the
court
of
international
trade
to
reach
the
correct
decision
in
customs
cases
and
that
this
statutory
obligation
was
inconsistent
with
affording
any
deference
to
treasury
interpretations.
respondent
has
abandoned
that
reasoning
in
this
court,
and
the
reasoning
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
manifestly
incorrect.
the
statute
on
which
the
court
of
appeals
relied
is
28
u.s.c.
2643(b).
that
statute
merely
provides
procedural
options
for
the
court
of
international
trade
in
situations
where
the
evidence
presented
to
that
court
is
not
sufficient
for
it
to
reach
the
correct
decision.
in
adopting
the
statute
in
1980,
the
legislative
history
made
clear
that
congress
merely
intended
to
provide
to
the
court
of
international
trade
the
same
kind
of
remand
and
retrial
authority
possessed
generally
by
federal
district
courts.
certainly
nothing
in
the
history
of
that
provision
reflects
any
intention
by
congress
to
abandon
the
principle
of
deference
to
treasury
interpretations
that
this
court
had
articulated
only
2
years
prior
to
that
date.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
these
are...
the
regulations
that
are
at
issue
in
this
case
are
interpretive
regulations.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
absolutely.
it
is...
the
question
is--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--the
question
that
the
federal
circuit
resolved
was
a
different
question,
incorrectly
in
our
view.
the
federal
circuit
concluded
that
they
could
ignore
the
regulation
altogether,
that
the
regulation
was
to
be
given
no
deference,
was
in
effect
a
null
and
void
act,
because,
the
court
reasoned,
that
the
court
of
international
trade
was
supposed
to
reach
the
correct
decision.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
well,
if...
if
by
the
expert
body
you're
referring
to
you're
referring
to
the
court
of
international
trade,
the
court
of
international
trade
is
a
specialized
court
just
like
the
tax
court,
and
the
tax
court,
just
like
the
court
of
international
trade,
has
been
directed
by
this
court
in
decisions
such
as
national
muffler
dealers
and
for
the
court
of
international
trade
in
the
zenith
radio
case
to
defer
to
the
agency's
reasonable
interpretation.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
i--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--no.
clearly...
clearly
you
have
more
fairly
described
the
actual
standard
that
the
court
has
applied,
and
when
i
didn't
bicker
with--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--all
right.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
well,
it
is
crucial
to
the
disposition
of
the
case
ultimately
that
the
court
do
what
this
court
said
it
should
in
zenith
radio
which
is
to
defer
to--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--yes.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
you're
asking
a
question
that
i
think
it's
fair
to
say
the
court
has
never
answered,
which
is
in
this...
there...
there's
a
high
chevron
and
a
low
chevron,
and
then
there's
in
between
that
hasn't
been
fully
elaborated
by
the
court.
the
high
chevron
is
where
the
agency
is
given
an
express
authority
to
interpret
a
particular
statutory
provision
and
makes
a
substantive
legislative
rule.
and
then
it's
to
be
treated
as
valid
if
it's
not
arbitrary
and
capricious
and
clearly
inconsistent
with
the
statute.
there's
a
low
chevron
that
doesn't
require
any
statutory
authority
to
adopt
rules.
it's
based
simply
on
the
implied
authority
of
the
agency
to
interpret
and
implement
the
statute
that
congress
has
designated
for
it
to
administer.
what
we
have
here
and
also
in
the
internal
revenue
code
is
something
in
between.
we
have
an
express
statutory
authority
to
issue
rules
generally.
for
example,
19
u.s.c.
1624
is...
provides
a
general
authority
to
the
treasury
to
adopt
any
necessary
rules
under
the
tariff
act.
that's
precisely
parallel
to
26
u.s.c.
7805
which
authorizes
the
treasury
to
adopt
any
needful
rules
under
the
internal
revenue
code.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
well,
i
think
the
court
has
resisted
the
temptation
to
vulcanize--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--i
may
be
referring
to
this
in
a
more
academic
than
a
practical
way.
as
a
practical
way,
i
think
which
is
the
way
the
court
has
addressed
it,
basically
there
are
two
standards.
there
is
the
standard
of
what
i
call
the
high
chevron
standard,
which
is
perhaps
the
skidmore
test
you're
referring
to,
which
is
when
the
agency
has
specific
rulemaking
power
granted
by
congress
for
a
specific
subject.
that's
the
high
deference.
the
lower
deference
in
chevron
doesn't
require
any
specific
grant
of
statutory
power.
it's
based
on
what
the
court
described
in
chevron
as
the
implied
authority
to
interpret
and
implement
a
scheme
when
congress
has
told
the
agency
to
administer
it.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
it...
i...
well,
it's
more
than
that.
there's
a
parallel
provision.
the
1624
that
i
referred
to
is
parallel
to
the
general
interpretive
authority
in
the
internal
revenue
code.
in
addition,
there
is
a
specific
interpretive
authority
for
classification
issues
which,
of
course,
this
case
involves.
it
authorizes
the
treasury
adopting
the
rules
and
regulations
for
the
classification
of
goods,
classification
and
assessment
of
tariffs.
now,
respondent's
new
argument,
the
one
that
he
didn't
make
below
but
is
presenting
to
this
court,
is
that...
that
this...
that
a
statutory
authority
to
issue
the
classification
rules
is
limited
in
1502
by
a
clause
at
the
end
of
it
which
says,
classification
rules
at
the
port...
various
ports
of
entry.
and
respondent,
without
any
authority
whatever,
says
that
just
reading
that,
they
can
tell
that
that
means
that
it
doesn't
permit
rules
that
apply
to
importers,
that
it
only
applies
to
customs
officers.
well,
that's
illogical
and
it's
also
inconsistent
with
the
longstanding
principle
of
this
court
since
1809
in
vowell
and
m'clean
that
tariff
duties
only
arise
at
the
ports
of
entry,
in
the
words
of
that
opinion.
so,
a
rule
that
classifies
goods
at
the
ports
of
entry
applies
directly
to
importers
because
that's
where
the
duties
arise,
that's
where
the
goods
are
classified
and
valued,
and
where
the
duties
are
assessed.
respondent's
new
argument...
i
think
i
should,
you
know,
put
it
in...
in
its
framework.
respondent's
new
argument
is
that
because
the
court
of
international
trade
is
to
make
a
de
novo
determination
of
liability,
that
that
is
inconsistent
with
giving
deference
to
the
treasury's
interpretation
of
the
legal
issues
involved
in
the
case.
in
fact,
respondent
goes
so
far
as
to
say
that
whenever
a
court
is
to
make
a
de
novo
determination
of
liability,
it
is
to
ignore
agency
regulations
even
when
congress
has
expressly
authorized
the
agency
to
adopt
interpretive
rules.
that...
that
suggestion
is
radical
and
it's
flatly
inconsistent
with
general
case
law
of
this
court
and,
in
particular,
it's
inconsistent
with
the
customs
and
tax
litigation.
in
customs
and
tax
cases,
federal
courts
have
long
been
charged
with
the
responsibility
of
making
independent
factual
determinations,
of
making
determinations
of
law
and
applying
the
facts
to
the
law
to
determine
ultimately
independently
the
amount
of
tax
or
customs
duty
owed.
the
federal
district
courts
do
that.
the
court
of
federal
claims
does
it,
the
court
of
international
trade
and
the
tax
court.
they
all
have
exactly
the
same
responsibility.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
if...
you
know--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--well,
no,
and...
and
certainly
i
want
to
address
that,
but
i
also
want
to
point
out
that
they
cited
a
law
review
article
authored
by
you
for
that
proposition.
and
if
one
looks
at
that
law
review
article,
what
one
sees
is
that
the
article
said
that
if
congress
directed
the
courts
not
to
give
any
deference
to
the
agency
and
provided
for
de
novo
review,
that's...
that's...
the
difference
is
that
in
providing
for
de
novo
review,
congress
has
not
told
the
agencies
to
ignore
the
courts.
in
fact,
zenith
radio
is
exactly
that
kind
of
a
case,
as
is
atlantic
mutual,
which
the
court
decided
last
term.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
there
were
treasury
decisions.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
it's
a
lesser--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--yes.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
yes,
and
the
difference
would
be,
as
you
pointed
out,
to
suggest
even
greater
deference
would
be
owed
to
the
agency's
formal
interpretation
set
forth
in
an
interpretive
rule.
and,
indeed,
this
interpretive
rule,
that
we
will
address
later
on
in
this
argument,
was
issued
as
a
result
of
notice
and
comment
procedures.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
the...
the--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--well,
there's
two...
two
types
of...
of
law...
two
ways
to
answer
that.
one
is
legislative
proposals.
legislative
proposals,
under
a
formal
method
provided
for
in
the
tariff
acts,
come
through
the
president,
but
with
the
consultation
with
the
treasury.
and
as
a
practical
matter,
i
think
it's
realistic
to
assume,
although
the
statutes
don't
lay
this
out,
that
the
treasury
has
a
substantial
role
in
that
process
unless
the
president
spends
a
lot
of
time.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
well,
there's
the
customs--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--oh,
of
course.
i
mean,
in
the
tax
area
there's
the
internal
revenue
service.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
in
the
customs
area,
there's
the
customs
service.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
you're
asking
a
question
that
i
think
might
be
beyond
my
ability
to
answer.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
i
think
what
makes
a
difference
is--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--i
just
want
the
court
to...
to
repeat
what
it
held
in
zenith
radio,
which
is
that
the
standard
amount
of
deference
is
owed
to
these
regulations
that
are--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--no.
in
enacting
the
harmonized
tariff
schedule
in
1988,
congress
noted
the
different
roles
performed
by
the
various
entities,
and
it
specifically
said
that
the
role
of
interpreting
and
applying
the
harmonized
tariff
schedule
was
designated
to
the
customs
service,
which
works,
of
course,
for
the
treasury.
the...
the
rulemaking
authority
is...
is
designated
by
statute
to
the
secretary
of
the
treasury,
and
it
is
subdelegated
by
regulation
to
the
customs
service,
but
the
customs
service
can't
adopt
regulations
until
the
secretary
approves
them.
so,
ultimately
it
is
the
function
of
the
treasury
to
adopt
these
rules
and
regulations.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
it--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--i
can't...
it's
hard
for
me
to
come
to
grips
with
such
a
broad
proposition,
but
certainly--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--there...
there
is
no
other
source
of
interpretive
authority
under
the
tariff
act
other
than
the
treasury
acting
through
the
customs
service.
that
is
it.
these
are
its
authoritative,
interpretive
regulations,
and
the
court...
federal
circuit
just
went
down
this
route
of
looking
at
this
procedural
statute
and
said,
well,
that
justifies
us
not
applying
the
deference
that
zenith
radio
said
we
should
apply,
although
they
didn't
cite
zenith
radio
and
didn't
try
to
distinguish
it
in
their
opinion.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
respondent
has
done
a
good
job
of...
of
fairly
confusing
something
that's
really
very
clear.
what
is
very
clear
is
that
up
through
the
time
that
zenith
radio
was
decided
in
1978
and
for
a
year
past
that,
through
1979,
in
the
words
of
the
customs
court
in
the
asg
industries
case,
which
is
cited
on
page
6
of
respondent's
brief...
and
i'll
quote
the
court.
every
countervailing
duty
case
litigated,
just
as
every
tariff
classification
and
valuation
case
in
modern
times
has
been
tried
de
novo
in
this
court.
that
de
novo
review
was
the
only
form
of
review
known
to
the
customs
court
through
the
zenith
radio
case.
it
was
after
that
that
congress
said
that
certain
countervailing
duty
cases
can
be
reviewed
on
the
administrative
record.
through
1978...
and
by
the
way,
in
that
1979
opinion,
the
customs
court
specifically
referred
to
its
opinion
in
zenith
radio
as
an
example
of
a
de
novo
review
proceeding.
so,
the
court's
holding
in
zenith...
this
court's
holding
in
zenith
radio
that
the
customs
court
should
defer
to
the
agency's
reasoned
interpretation
of
the
statute
is
directly
applicable
to
this
case.
that
was
just
as
much
a
de
novo
proceeding
as
this
one
is.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
yes.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
right.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
well,
i
think
it's
more...
it's
sort
of
polite
surplusage.
what...
what
the
agency
meant...
i
think
the
amicus
customs
and
trade
bar
association
is
absolutely
right,
that
what
this
last
sentence
reflects
is
simply
the
agency
making
clear
that
its
rules,
as
it
said
in
the
first
sentence
of
this
introductory
paragraph...
its
rules
here
are
interpretive
and
are
not
substantive
legislative,
binding
legislative
rules
that
are
designed
to
preclude
judicial
review
of
the
topics.
the
agency
had
been
criticized
in
the
comments,
which
frankly
shouldn't
be
considered
by
the
court
because
they
weren't
properly
raised
in
this
case,
but
they
have
been
filed
in
an
untimely
fashion.
but
in
any
event,
the
agency
was
asked
to
consider
whether
it
had
authority
to
adopt
such
rules
and
it
concluded
in
the...
that
it
had
authority
to
adopt
interpretive
rules
but
it
didn't
mean
to
adopt
binding
legislative
rules.
and
i
think
that
was
a
correct
assessment.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
it's
very
common--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--oh,
i--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--i
think,
justice
scalia,
that
if
you
look
at
the
chevron...
the...
the
paragraph
in
chevron
that
talks
ultimately
about
reasonable
agency
rules,
a
couple
of
sentences
earlier
you'll
see
a
standard,
a
sentence
talking
about
deferring
when
it's
not
arbitrary
and
capricious.
and
that's
what
i
was
talking
about,
the
high
chevron
standard
and
the
low.
i
don't
think
i'm
making
this
up.
i
think...
i
would
just
encourage
you
to
look
at
that
paragraph
in
the
court's
opinion.
and
i--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--well,
it...
it
reflects
decades
of
opinions.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
well,
if...
if
i'm
wrong
about
that,
then--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--it
is
a
different
articulation
of
the
degree
of
deference,
whether
as
a
practical
matter,
as
i
said
earlier,
it
results
in
different
decisions--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--i
think
because
it
is
in
fact
a
very
complex
subject,
that
when
congress
tells
an
agency
to
do
something,
it
may
be...
and
it
does
it,
maybe
that
has
a
little
more
legislative
effect
than
when
the
agency
is
just
interpreting
something
without
any
legislative
direction.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
let
me
make
clear
that
i...
this
case
does
not
turn
on
this
distinction
because
all
we're
saying
is
that
what
we...
all
that
i'm
saying
and
i
believe
that
the
united
states
is
saying
is
that...
is
that
we
believe
that
what
is...
what
i've
described
as
the
lower
chevron
deference
standard
applies
in
this
case.
it
is
the
articulation
of
the
standard
in
zenith
radio
that
is
identical
to
this.
it's
the
same
standard
in
zenith
radio
as
to
what
i've
talked
about
is
the
second
standard
in
chevron.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
i'm
relying
on
that
assumption.
maybe
i
could

rebuttal
argument,
please?
mr.
kent
l.
jones
i
think
that
there
is
a
logical
and
substantive
difference
between
the
two
formulations.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
which
is
that
when
congress
has
given
an
agency
an
express
authority
to
interpret
a
specific
statutory
phrase...
for
example,
an
agency
might
be
told
to
decide
what...
what
kind
of
chemicals
are
bad
pollutants,
and
when
it
does
that,
its
determination
is
going
to
be
upheld
unless
it's
arbitrary
and
capricious
and
it's
utterly
unsupported
by
the
statute.
that's
the
kind
of
substantive
legislative
rule.
on
the
other
hand,
if
congress
didn't
give
such
authority
to
the
agency
and
the
agency
was
simply
saying
we
think
boron
is
a
bad
pollutant,
that
would...
should
be
sustained
if
it's
a
reasonable
interpretation.
now,
if
i
may,
i
think
i
should--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--i...
i
can't
draw
that
distinction.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
i
think
that
the
distinction
is
not
on
whether
another
one
could
be
unreasonably
sustained.
it's
whether
it
could
be
arbitrary...
whether
if
it
weren't
arbitrary
and
capricious,
it
could
be
sustained.
these
are
tests
this
court
has
articulated.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
please
do.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
yes.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
if...
if
one...
i
don't
want
to
be
tautological
because
i
don't
think
there
is
a
simple
tautological
answer,
but
the
tautological
point
is
that
if
the
permapressing
occurs
in
the
foreign
country--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--yes,
there
is
a
difference
because
in...
in
your
hypothetical
the...
the
material
that
was
permapressed
was
improved.
the
other
material
was
just--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--yes.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
because
the
regulation
addresses
the
statutory
issue,
and
so
let
me
put
the
issue
in
the...
in
the
context
of
the
statute.
this
regulation
interprets
a
statutory
provision
that
provides
a
duty
exemption
for
goods
that
are...
that
are
manufactured
in
the
united
states,
exported
abroad,
assembled
abroad,
and
then
returned
to
the
united
states.
those
duties
come
back...
those
goods
come
back
duty
free.
but
the
statute
provides
that
this
exemption
will
not
be
available
if
while
the
goods
were
abroad,
they
were
improved
by
a
process
that
was
not
incidental
to
the
assembly
process.
the
regulation
interprets
the
statutory
phrase,
incidental
to
the
assembly
process,
by
stipulating,
specifying
that
any
substantial
process
performed
abroad,
other
than
assembly,
than
has
the
primary
purpose
of
improving
the
article
is
not
to
be
regarded
as
incidental
to
assembly.
and
it's
one
of
approximately
10
examples.
it
says
the
chemical
alteration
of
fabric
by
permapressing
is
an
example
of
such
a
specific
process
performed...
substantial
process
performed
abroad
that's
for
the
purpose
of
improvement.
the
regulation
is
a
reasonable
interpretation
of
the
statute
because
the
history
of
the
statute
makes
clear
that
congress
in...
in
authorizing
incidental
to
assembly
operations
abroad
meant
to
encompass
only,
in
the
words
of
the
conference
report,
minor
operations,
minor
processes,
and
as
examples
gave
cleaning
and
lubricating
of
an
assembled
article
as
an...
as
examples,
and
went
on
to
say
cleaning
and
lubricating,
in
describing
them,
said
such
processes,
if
of
a
minor
nature,
may
be
regarded
as
incidental
to
assembly.
now,
the
regulation
in
saying
that
significant
processes
for
the
improvement
is
plainly
generally
valid
under
this
meaning
of
the
statute
and,
as
applied
to
permapressing,
is
also
valid
because,
as
the
facts
of
this
case
make
clear,
permapressing
involves
a
significant
amount
of
capital
and
time
in
the
foreign
operation.
it
is
wholly
unrelated
to
the
assembly
process,
and
it's
for
the
purpose
of
improvement.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
well,
all
of
the
permapressing
operation
for
this
purpose
is
done
in
mexico.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
let
me
answer
that.
at
page
20
of
the
joint
appendix--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--well,
the
chemical
spraying
of
the
fabric
occurred
in
the
united
states,
but
the
permapressing,
as
described
on
page
20
of
the
joint
appendix
in
the
complaint
is...
is
obtained
when...
and
i'm
quoting
the
complaint...
the
heat
of
the
oven
expels
a
molecule
of
water
from
the
pre-polymer
in
the
fabric,
which
cross-links
the
cellulose
fibers.
that
is
the
permapressing.
the
work
done
in
the
united
states
was
like
the
manufacture
of
the
cloth.
it
was
a
significant
step
towards
coming
up
with
an
article
that
was
going
to
be
permapressed,
but
the
permapressing
actually
occurred
in
mexico.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
yes.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
well,
again
in
saying
that
paint--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--in
saying
that
painting
can
be
incidental
to
the
assembly
process,
the
history
makes
clear
that
it's
painting
of
a
minor
nature.
and...
and,
indeed,
in
the
general
motors
case,
for
example,
which
is
cited
in...
in
the
briefs,
the
court
of...
the
federal
circuit
correctly
held
that
some
kinds
of
operations
that
you
might
call
painting
are,
in
fact,
a
lot
more
significant
than
just
this
kind
of
minor
nature
of
stuff
than...
that
is
involved
in
protective
coating.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
no.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
it
is--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--it
is...
it
is
the
latter,
and...
and
we
think
that
the
facts
clearly
reflect
that
the
regulation
should
properly
be
applied
in
this
case,
but
in
fairness,
the
court
has
not--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--it
is
the
ultimate
issue
that
the
courts
have.
whether
this
court
thinks
it's
prepared
to
reach
that
question
or
not,
i
can't
say,
but
i
can
say
that
the
courts
below
have
not
reached
it
because
the
federal
circuit
incorrectly
held
that
it
could
ignore
the
regulation
altogether.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
yes.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
well,
it--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--yes.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
true.
if
the
permapressing
is
performed
abroad,
then
it's
a
significant
operation
that
doesn't...
that
disqualifies
the
goods
for
the
assembly.
and
in
our
view
the
permapressing
is
the
permanent
pressing
that
occurs.
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
just
want
to
see
if
i
can
point
the
court
to
what
seems
to
be
a
little
bit
of
a
confusion
in
the
presentation
here.
there
are
three
steps
to
reaching
a
conclusion.
you
find
the
facts,
you
determine
the
law,
and
you
apply
the
facts
to
the
law.
chevron
operates
at
that
second
stage
only.
a
court
can
make
a
de
novo
determination
of
the
facts
and
that
doesn't
change
the
fact
that
in
determining
what
the
law
is,
it
is
to
defer
to
the
agency's
reasoned
interpretations.
the
court
has
held
that
in
many
cases
and
has
specifically
held
it
in...
in
the
one
case
that
respondent
cites
as
his
leading
authority,
adams
fruit
company
v.
barrett.
in
adams
fruit
company,
the
court
held
that
there
was
a
de
novo
review,
that
the
agency
couldn't
interpret
the
scope
of
the
judicial
remedy,
but
that
that
didn't
deprive
the
agency
of
its
authority
to
make
substantive
interpretations
of
the
statute.
and
the
court
went
on
to
say
that
in
that
de
novo
exclusive
judicial
proceeding,
the
court
would
defer
to
the
agency's
reasoned
interpretations
of
the
substantive
scheme.
that
is
a
principle
that
the
court
has
applied
in
numerous
contexts,
not
just
in
tax
and
customs
cases,
but
has
specifically
applied
it
in
customs
cases.
the
court
would
have
to,
in
effect,
overrule
zenith
radio
to...
to
change
that
standard
in
this
case.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
sure.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
well,
i
don't
think
that
there
are
facts
in
this
case
that
involve
pressing
a
little
longer.
in
fact,
the
facts
show
that
they
didn't
do
that,
that
that's
not
practical.
and
i
don't
know
what
is
being
referred
to
at
this
point
in
the
argument.
but
let
me
answer
your...
your
question
more
generically.
a
quibble
about
the
application
of
the
permapressing
rule
to
this
case
doesn't
denigrate
the...
the
validity
of
the
substantive
provision
of
the
regulation.
it
defines
acts
incidental
to
assembly
to
not
include
significant
processes.
the
court
can
rely
on
the...
on
the
general
standard
even
if
it's
confused
about
the
application
of
the
example.
and
the
general
standard
plainly
applies
when...
when...
on
the
findings
of
the
trial
court
that
there
was
significant
capital,
significant
time.
it
was
unrelated
to
assembly
and
it
was
for
the
purpose
of
improvement.
the
trial
court
said
that
these
factors
militate
against
a
duty
allowance,
but
the
court
balanced
them
to
reach
a
different
conclusion.
well,
the
agency's
balance
is
different,
and
as
this
court
has
held
in
many
situations,
the
agency
doesn't
have
to
establish
that
its
regulation
is
the
only
reasonable
interpretation
or
that
it's
the
one
the
court
would
adopt
in
the
first
instance.
it's
sufficient,
under
chevron,
that
the
agency
made
a
reasoned
exposition
of
the
text
consistent
with
its
purpose
in
history.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
well,
i
think--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--if
you
look
at
the
very
first
sentence
of
that
paragraph
in
the
regulation,
it
says,
these
sections--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--i'm
sorry.
i
am
holding
in
my
hand
a
copy
of
the
regulations.
this
issue
was
raised
in
respondent's
brief,
and
i
don't
think...
i
don't
know
if
it's
cited.
the
very
first
sentence
of
the
regulation
says
that
these
sections
set
forth
definitions
and
interpretive--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--thank
you.
