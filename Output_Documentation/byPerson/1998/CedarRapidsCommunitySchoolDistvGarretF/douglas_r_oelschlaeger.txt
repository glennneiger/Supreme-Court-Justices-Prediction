mr.
douglas
r.
oelschlaeger
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
tatro
this
court
held
that
clean
intermittent
catheterization
was
a
related
service
which
the
school
district
had
to
provide
at
its
expense
in
order
for
amber
tatro
to
remain
in
school
and
benefit
from
her
education.
in
this
case,
the
issue
is
whether
additional
services
such
as
tracheostomy
suctioning,
periodic
positioning,
and
other
services
not
provided
by
a
physician,
are
also
related
services
which
the
district
must
provide
at
its
expense
in
order
for
garrett
fry
to
remain
in
school
and
obtain
an
education...
mr.
douglas
r.
oelschlaeger
justice
o'connor,
the
petitioner
has
categorized
these
services
as
continuous.
we've
categorized
them
as
intermittent.
we
believe
the
record
in
the
case
is
probably
once
or
twice
in
the
morning
and
once
or
twice
in
the
afternoon,
with
the
exception
of
the
positioning
services.
garrett
would
need
some
form
of
intervention,
either
suctioning
the
tracheostomy
once
a
day,
catheterization
once
a
day,
positioning
for
5
minutes
every
hour.
other
than
that,
alls
he
needs
is
someone
within
earshot,
and
i
would
propose
if
you
had
a
classroom
that
had
a
teacher's
aide
or
associate
for
some
other
child,
you
could
basically
train
that
aide
to
listen
and
intervene
infrequently
during
the
day
and
the
services
could
be
provided
in
that
way,
and
that
was
certainly
the
record
in
the
case,
was
that...
mr.
douglas
r.
oelschlaeger
yes.
mr.
douglas
r.
oelschlaeger
right.
garrett
has
an
educational
aide.
mr.
douglas
r.
oelschlaeger
they
certainly
could
with
minimal
training
and
that
was
the
record.
for
example,
in
garrett's
kindergarten
year
his
18-year-old
aunt,
stephanie
madison,
provided
these
services,
no
nursing
training,
unlicensed
person.
the
school
district
agreed
for
this
unlicensed
person...
mr.
douglas
r.
oelschlaeger
yes.
mr.
douglas
r.
oelschlaeger
yes.
congress
enacted
the
idea
to
provide
a
basic
floor
of
educational
opportunity
and
access
for
children
with
disabilities.
mr.
douglas
r.
oelschlaeger
well,
we
believe
congress,
justice
scalia,
in
1401(a)(17),
when
it
defined
related
services
broadly
and
included
supportive
services
and
listed
some,
didn't
list
all,
we
believe
they
defined
it
to
include
a
service
to
assist
a
child
with
a
disability...
mr.
douglas
r.
oelschlaeger
okay.
[laughter]
mr.
douglas
r.
oelschlaeger
except
in
this
case
they're
not
provided
by
a
physician,
so
i
suppose
if
a
physician
sat
there
and
listened
all
day
to
see
if
there
was
some
difficulty
in
breathing,
then
that
expressly
would
be
an
included
service.
mr.
douglas
r.
oelschlaeger
that
seems
to
be
the
statutory
definition,
yes.
mr.
douglas
r.
oelschlaeger
that
is
so.
1401(a)(17)
says
that,
your
honor,
yes.
mr.
douglas
r.
oelschlaeger
right.
i
am
mistaken
in
my
response
to
justice
scalia.
mr.
douglas
r.
oelschlaeger
right.
that
would
be
in
a
treatment...
mr.
douglas
r.
oelschlaeger
treatment
modality
at
that
point,
yes,
your
honor.
the
point
i
was
trying
to
make
is,
the
district's
position
here
appears
to
be
cost-based,
and
i
think
that's
fairly
clear.
we
do
not
believe
that
the
idea
is
some
form
of
blank
check
legislation.
this
court
recognized
in
the
florence
county
case
that
the
ida...
idea
is
a
broadly
remedial
statute,
and
that
states,
if
participating,
will
have
to
spend
a
substantial
amount
of
money.
we
believe
congress
recognized
this
as
well
in
other
parts
of
the
statute,
not
in
the
part
of
the
statute
where
one
defines
what
is
a
medical
or
related
service,
but
in
other
parts
of
the
statute.
mr.
douglas
r.
oelschlaeger
yes.
in
1407...
mr.
douglas
r.
oelschlaeger
okay.
i'll
address
that
right
now,
your
honor.
first
of
all,
the
letter
in
the
appendix
i
believe
was
raised...
asked
in
the
context
of
what
the
current
judicial
interpretation
was
of
the
related
service
and
medical
service
issue,
and
the
letter
itself
goes
through
not
to
explain
necessarily...
mr.
douglas
r.
oelschlaeger
i
think
the
letter
is
exhibit
d
to
the
petition
for
certiorari.
it's
at
page
64a.
mr.
douglas
r.
oelschlaeger
64a,
and
the
letter
starts
out
and
talks
about
the
case-by-case
analysis,
which
is
what
is
required
under
the
iep,
or
individualized
education
plan
procedures
of
the
statute,
and
then
proceeds
to
explain
how
various
district
courts,
the
detsel
court,
various
circuit
courts
have
interpreted
those
provisions.
the
legislative,
or
the
regulatory
action
in
this
case,
justice
breyer,
came
in
1977
when
the
initial
regulations
were
promulgated
under
the
idea
by
the
department
of
education.
they
included
the
regulations
that
are
involved
in
this
case,
the
definition
of
medical
services,
the
definition
of
school
health
services,
and
those
regulations
have
remained
unchanged
since
1977.
they've
been
on
the
books
21
years.
mr.
douglas
r.
oelschlaeger
well,
the
24
hours
a
day
might
be
different.
the
fact
that
an
rn
were
required
as
opposed
to
an
lpn,
or
a
nonlicensed
aide,
doesn't
change
the
analysis
in
my
regard
simply
because
the
statutory
definition
gives
the
medical
service
exclusion,
and
that
has
been
defined
by
the
agency
to
be
something
required
to
be
done
by
a
physician.
now...
mr.
douglas
r.
oelschlaeger
that's
true.
mr.
douglas
r.
oelschlaeger
although
again,
given
the
facts
of
this
case,
an
ambulance
could
be
summoned
by
a
911
call.
mr.
douglas
r.
oelschlaeger
i
understand.
mr.
douglas
r.
oelschlaeger
the...
mr.
douglas
r.
oelschlaeger
okay.
i
think
the
question
really
gets
to
the
heart
of
what
is
a
related
service
and
what
limitations
did
the
court
adopt...
mr.
douglas
r.
oelschlaeger
okay.
mr.
douglas
r.
oelschlaeger
the
limitations
in
tatro
were
expressed
to
be,
the
child
is
handicapped
so
as
to
require
special
education.
we
have
that
here.
only
those
services
necessary
to
aid
the
handicapped
child
to
benefit
from
special
education
must
be
provided.
that's
true
here.
and
school
nursing
services
must
be
provided
only
if
they
can
be
performed
by
a
nurse
or
other
qualified
person,
not
if
they
must
be
performed
by
a
physician.
so
24-hour-a-day
nursing
service
while
the
child
is
not
at
school
does
not
qualify,
we
believe,
as
a
related
service,
but
while
he's
at
school...
mr.
douglas
r.
oelschlaeger
yes.
mr.
douglas
r.
oelschlaeger
again
you'd
have
to
get
into
the
iep
procedure.
in
a
sense
you
do
have
to
go
on
a
case-by-case
basis,
but
if
the
iep
team
looked
at
it,
found
that
an
ambulance
was
there,
was
needed
to
prevent
some
form
of
severe...
mr.
douglas
r.
oelschlaeger
right,
and
again
that's
a
virtually
nonexistent
risk
in
this
case
on
the
record,
but
yes.
mr.
douglas
r.
oelschlaeger
well,
i
think
this
case
is
merely
an
extension
of
the
tatro
case.
where
tatro
recognized
clean
intermittent
catheterization
as
a
related
service,
we're
asking
the
court...
and
i
think
perhaps
the
school
district
conceded
this
in
their
portion
of
the
argument,
that
tracheostomy
care
be
recognized
as
a
related
service,
that
positioning
services
be
recognized
as
a
related
service,
and
the
definition
in
1401(a)(17)
and
the
regulations
be
followed.
there's...
nowhere
in
there
does
there
appear
an
exception
to
what
constitutes
a
related
service
based
on...
mr.
douglas
r.
oelschlaeger
right.
the
two
regulations
at
issue,
your
honor,
would
be
300.16,
subpart
(4)
of
the
definition
of
medical
services.
that's
at...
mr.
douglas
r.
oelschlaeger
right,
and
that
was
the
one
that
the
tatro...
mr.
douglas
r.
oelschlaeger
not
by
a
physician,
anyhow.
mr.
douglas
r.
oelschlaeger
then
you
have
to
look
at
the
regulation
(b)(11),
300.16
(b)(11).
it's
at
page...
mr.
douglas
r.
oelschlaeger
right,
and
it's
our
position...
mr.
douglas
r.
oelschlaeger
that
would
be
page
8a
of
the
appendix
to
the
united
states'
brief
on
the
merits.
mr.
douglas
r.
oelschlaeger
i
think
there's
an
element
of
that,
your
honor,
and
of
course
we
believe
that
to
be
directly
refuted
by
the
statute,
particularly
in
regards
to
the
1997
amendments.
in
other
words,
not
having
enough
nurses
shouldn't
be
considered
when
you
define
what
is
or
is
not
a
medical
service.
mr.
douglas
r.
oelschlaeger
well,
there
is
also
the
second
half
of
the
definition,
your
honor,
qualified
school
nurse
or
other
qualified
person.
mr.
douglas
r.
oelschlaeger
yes.
that's,
we
believe...
mr.
douglas
r.
oelschlaeger
justice
o'connor,
i
think
that's
a
fair
comment.
i
think
other
portions
of
the
statute
do
suggest
that,
however.
in
1412(2)(c)
and
1412(3),
i
don't...
unfortunately
i
don't
think
either
of
these
sections
are
reproduced
in
the
brief.
it's
clear
that
congress'
intent
here
was
the
most
severely
disabled
child,
the
intent
of
the...
mr.
douglas
r.
oelschlaeger
they're
both
in
20
u.s.c.
section
1412(2)(c),
all
children
residing
in
the
state
who
are
disabled,
regardless
of
the
severity
of
their
disability,
and
then
subsection
(3)
of
that
same
1412,
the
state
has
to
have
a
plan
first
to
address
children
who
got
no
education,
which
was
the
problem
discussed
in
rowley,
and
then
children
with
the
most
severe
disabilities.
mr.
douglas
r.
oelschlaeger
i
understand
that.
the
other
area
of
the
idea
which
i
think
supports
this
position
is
the
area
of
residential
placements.
there
are
reported
circuit
and
district
court
decisions...
there
are
several
in
our
brief...
where
placements
in
the
approximate
range
of
$100,000
per
year
are
accepted.
in
fact,
in
one
of
the
cases
they
were
arguing
over
whether
a
$50,000
placement
was
appropriate,
or
$150,000
placement
was
appropriate.
idea
is
broad
legislation.
it's
clear
that
congress
intended,
for
states
that
accepted
the
money,
that
there
would
be
substantial
sums...
mr.
douglas
r.
oelschlaeger
no.
mr.
douglas
r.
oelschlaeger
it's
my
understanding
that
initially
new
mexico
didn't
get
involved,
but
now
all
50
states
are
involved
in
the
program.
mr.
douglas
r.
oelschlaeger
right,
and
there
is...
there's
statutory
definitions
for
your
help,
your
honor.
mr.
douglas
r.
oelschlaeger
no,
and
again
i
think
the
limitation
in
the
tatro
case
relates
to
services
provided
during
the
school
day
to
get
the
child
in
the
front
door,
to
keep
them
there
for
the
school
day,
and
then
to
get
them
home.
mr.
douglas
r.
oelschlaeger
oh,
i
think...
mr.
douglas
r.
oelschlaeger
it
is
a
broad
definition.
i
think
the
court
in
tatro
recognized
that
and
placed
some
limitations
upon
it,
but
the
idea...
mr.
douglas
r.
oelschlaeger
right,
to
benefit
from
the
education.
mr.
douglas
r.
oelschlaeger
well...
mr.
douglas
r.
oelschlaeger
except
if
the
child
dies
obviously
there's
no
benefit
from
education.
mr.
douglas
r.
oelschlaeger
then
the
other
cost
limitation,
your
honor,
and
again
i
think
the
district's
primary
position
here
is
the
cost,
in
the
rowley
case
the
court
held
that
idea
provides
for
a
floor
of
educational
opportunity.
once
the
floor
is
met,
if
there
are
better
and
more
expensive
related
services
that
would
get
a
better
result,
the
school
district's
not
required
to
pay
that,
and
we're
not
asking
for
that
in
this
case,
so
that
is
an
additional
cost
limitation
we
believe
contained
in
the
idea,
but
again,
cost
just
is
not
a
factor
in
how
you
define
related
service
or
medical
service.
mr.
douglas
r.
oelschlaeger
right.
mr.
douglas
r.
oelschlaeger
in
some
circumstances,
yes,
in
the
institutional
placement,
and
there
are
reported
decisions
on
that,
your
honor.
there's
also
a
home-based
program,
but
we
believe
that
the
act
also
expresses
a
preference
for
mainstreaming.
in
section...
mr.
douglas
r.
oelschlaeger
well,
home-based
instruction,
your
honor,
and
there's
materials
in
the
brief
on
this,
is
typically
an
hour
or
two
a...
per
week
of
instruction
for
the
child
at
home,
and
that
we
would
submit
is
not
in
keeping
with
the
intent
of
the
idea...
mr.
douglas
r.
oelschlaeger
mainstreaming
in
paragraph...
thank
you.
