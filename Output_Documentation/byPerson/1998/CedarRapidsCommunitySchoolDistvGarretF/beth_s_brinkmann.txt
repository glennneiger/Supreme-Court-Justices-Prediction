ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
thank
you...
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
your
honor,
i'm
not
aware
of
the
circumstances
surrounding
that
delay.
i
apologize
for
that
lack
of
knowledge.
i
do
know
that
sometimes
these
inquiries
come
in
and
the
department
of
education
may
ask
informally
for
additional
information
in
a
particular
case.
i'm
not
sure
of
the
circumstances
surrounding
this,
but...
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
i
would...
[laughter]
i
would
think
not,
your
honor.
the
important
facts
here...
and
i
think
that
what
the
court
has
to
focus
on
is
that
the
services
here
are
not
excluded
as
medical
services
because
they
do
not
need
to
be
provided
by
a
physician.
there
are
three
main
reasons
why
that
is
correct.
first,
it's
consistent
with
the
secretary
of
education's
longstanding
interpretation,
which
i
will
discuss.
second,
that
interpretation
was
adopted
by
congress
in
1983
when
it
said
no
to
the
secretary's
attempt
to
broaden
the
medical
exclusion,
and
when
congress
enacted
a
specific
prohibition,
section
806
of
idea,
telling
the
secretary
of
education
that
he
could
not
promulgate
new
regulations
that
lessened
the
protections
of
those
regulations,
these
regulations
at
issue
here,
including
the
related
services
provision.
and
third,
because
this
court
in
tatro
recognized
that
the
secretary's
regulations
are
properly
interpreted
to
exclude
only
physician-provided
services
and
to
include
school
health
services,
and...
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
it
came
before
tatro,
your
honor,
in
fact,
the
year
before.
i've
looked
into
the
briefs
and
did
not
find
it
brought
to
the
court's
attention,
unfortunately.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
there
are
limits
in
other
aspects
of
the
act,
your
honor.
one
of
those
provisions
we
cited...
we
quote
at
page
9
of
our
brief.
it's
section
1412(5)(b).
that's
what's
often
called
the
least
restrictive
environment
provision,
or
the
mainstreaming
provision,
and
that
explains
that
the
preference,
as
my
co-counsel
indicated,
is
to
put
children
with
disabilities
in
a
regular
classroom
environment,
but
it
recognized
that
that
may
not
always
occur.
there
may
be
instances
when...
and
i'm
quoting
from
page
9...
the
nature
or
severity
of
the
disability
is
such
that
education
in
the
regular
classroom
with
the
use
of
supplementary
aids
and
services
cannot
be
achieved
satisfactorily,
so
there
are...
that's
certainly
a
limitation
on
services
that
would
be
required.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
yes,
it
is.
it
all
comes
down...
the
core
of
a
placement
for
a
child,
your
honor,
under
this
program
is
the
individualized
education
program.
that
placement
may
be
at
home.
that
may
be
in
some
kind
of
institutional
setting.
that's
correct.
if
i
could,
i'd
like
to
address
the
secretary
of
education's
interpretation,
and
it's
very
important,
i
think,
to
look
at
that
time
period
when
congress
adopted
this
in
1983,
and
if
you
look
at
the
appendix
to
our
brief
at
page
4a
you'll
see
at
the
bottom
the
codified
section
is
1407(b),
and
the
heading
of
that
section
is
lessening
of
procedural
or
substantive
protections
as
in
effect
on
july
20,
1983
is
prohibited.
these
are
the
substantive
protections
that
were
in
effect
at
that
time,
and
the
prior
year,
1982,
the
secretary
of
education
had
issued
a
proposed
rule-making
explaining
that
it
wanted
to...
he
wanted
to
broaden
the
medical
services
exclusion.
on
page
22
of
our
brief...
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
we
did,
your
honor,
because
on
page
22
in
the
federal
register
at
the
last
sentence
of
our
second
full
paragraph
on
page
22
we
quote
from
that
federal
register
proposal,
quote:
the
existing
regulations
define
medical
services
as
services
provided
by
a
licensed
physician,
and
the
proposed
changes,
the
secretary
is
very
explicit
that
he
wanted
to
broaden
that
medical
exclusion
to
consider
factors
precisely
what
petitioner
is
urging,
such
as
cost
moreover...
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
the
existing
regulation
is
what
we
currently
have,
where
it
has...
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
the
inclusion
of
school
health
services
and
then
defines
the
excluded
medical
services,
but
it's
certainly
a
legitimate...
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
yes.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
uh-huh.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
no,
your
honor.
we
believe
there
are
additional
things.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
there
is
that
statement
in
the
notice
of
proposed
rule-making
in
1982,
and
that's
fully
consistent
with
earlier
letters.
it
had
only
been
since
1977
that
the
regulation
was
in
place,
and
at
pages
17
to
18
of
our
brief
we
talk
about
the
letters
the
petitioner's
counsel
referred
to
about
psychotherapy
services
and
the
department
had
explained
there
that
if
those
services
are
administered
by
a
licensed
physician,
those
are
excluded
medical
services,
but
if
there
are
services
provided
by
other
professionals
such
as
a
psychiatric
social
worker,
et
cetera,
those
would
not
be
excluded.
and
there's
also
a
footnote
on
page
18
in
note
11
explaining
the
distinction
in
the
context
of
optometry.
that
note
also...
footnote
also
explains
then
answers
the
questions
about
diagnosis
being
able
to
be
provided
by
people
other
than
physicians.
i
would
also
point
out,
sir,
there
were
the
earlier
letters.
there's
the
1992
proposed
regulation
that
clearly
states
it.
moreover,
looking
at
what
the
secretary
of
education
wanted
to
do
was...
just
reinforces
the
fact
that
the
status
quo
at
that
time,
which
is
what
we
still
have,
was
this
bright
line
distinction.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
i'd
like
to
explain
that
letter.
i
think
in
order
to
understand
the
letter
you
have
to
understand
the
circumstances.
that
letter
actually
does
reinforce
the
secretary's
position.
what
it
says
is
that
you
have
to
look
at
it
on
a
case-by-case
basis
to
determine
whether
it's
a
required
related
service.
you
have
to
decide
under
the
tatro
thing,
for
example,
whether
or
not
the
child
is
disabled,
requires
special
education,
whether
it
needs
to
be
provided
by
the...
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
no,
it
doesn't
say
bright
line,
your
honor,
not
at
all.
you're
correct
about
that,
of
course.
but
what
the
letter
was
doing
was
responding
to
this
question,
and
if
petitioner
were
correct,
the
answer
in
that
letter
would
have
been,
it's
excluded
medical,
end
of
story,
and
there
would
have
been
no
further
analysis
of...
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
yes.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
your
honor,
i
think
to
rule
otherwise
would
clearly
be
inconsistent
with
the
court's
ruling
in
tatro,
and
congress'
positive
statutory
enactment
that
we
cite
at
page
8a
that
adopts
as
a
floor
these
regulations.
and
i
have
to
add,
your
honor,
several
of
those
courts
of
appeals
are
on
summary
affirmances
without
much
analysis,
and
also
there's
just
straightforward
statements
about
disagreeing
with
the
policy
undergirding
the
secretary's
regulations,
so
we
think
that
that's
no
reason
to
ignore
the
court's
precedents
about
the
deference
that
is
owed
to
the
department
of
education.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
again,
your
honor...
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
well,
again
your
honor,
i
would
urge
you
to
look
at
this
letter
in
the
context,
if
you...
you
realize
that
what
the
agency
was
explaining
is
that
yes,
this
is
an
eligible
school
health
service.
it's
not
an
excluded
medical
service.
but
just
because
it's
eligible
doesn't
mean
it's
a
required
related
service.
these
letters
could
not
decide
that.
it
has
to
be
decided
by
the
individual
education
program
in
the
context
of
a
particular
case.
moreover,
petitioners
have
cited
nothing
that
the
agency
has
ever
published
that
has
ever
said
anything
is
excluded
as
a
medical
service
that
was
not
provided
by
a
physician,
nothing.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
your
honor,
i
would
point
out
in
addition
to
the
proposed
rule-making
that
we
cite
on
page
22,
which
i
think
is
the
unequivocal
statement
in
those
earlier
letters
about
the
psychotherapy
and
the
optometrist,
that
also
at
the
time
of
this
proposed
change
in
the
regulation,
and
congress'
adoption,
incorporation,
codification,
ratification
of
this
regulation,
the
lower
courts
actually
agreed
with
that
bright
line.
you
had
the
fifth
circuit...
may
i
finish?
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
thank
you,
your
honor.
