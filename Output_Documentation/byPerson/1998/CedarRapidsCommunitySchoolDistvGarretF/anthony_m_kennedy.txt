well,
so
you
stipulate
that
the
tracheotomy
procedure
is...
can
be
a
nursing
service?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
i
thought
you
told
me
there
was
not
medical
in
the
event
of,
say,
the
tracheotomy.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
the
tracheotomy
is
not
medical,
i
thought,
because
nurses
routinely
do
this.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
if
you
are
saying
that
the
act
imposes
just
a
reasonable
burden
but
not
an
extensive
burden
on
the
states,
we
could
argue
on
that.
as
i
understood
the
case,
i
was
going
to
be
asked
to
determine
whether
or
not
this
was
a
medical
service,
and
it
seems
to
me
that
the
two
are
different
questions.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
school
health
services?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is
it
fair
to
say
that
the
petitioner's
position
reads,
school
health
services
means
services
usually
or
traditionally
provided
by
a
qualified
school
nurse?
is
that
a
fair
characterization
of
the
petitioner's
position?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
on
the
other
hand,
if
you
say
school
health
service
means
services
provided
by
a
qualified
school
nurse
and
that
they're
provided
by
the
nurse
in
this
case,
therefore
they're
automatically
covered,
that,
it
seems
to
me
to
be
a
somewhat
circular
definition
on
your
part.
