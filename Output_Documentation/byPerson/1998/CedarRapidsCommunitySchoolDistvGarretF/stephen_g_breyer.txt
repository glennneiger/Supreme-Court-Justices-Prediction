justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'd
like
to
ask
one
question.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
deal
with
this
area
quite
a
lot.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
good.
all
right.
if,
in
fact,
a
nurse
provides
a
diagnostic
or
evaluative
service,
a
nurse,
or
a
counselor
of
some
kind...
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
do
you
view
that
as
coming
within
the
act?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
do
you
think
that
the
agency
has
the
power
to
define
diagnostic...
to
define
medical
services
one
way
or
the
other?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
if
they
have
the
power,
then
i
take
it...
one
of
the
arguments
here
that
i'm
concerned
about
is
that
you
and
the
solicitor
general
say
they
exercise
that
power
along
the
lines
you
say,
and
they
say,
no
they
didn't,
and
indeed
the
letter
in
the
appendix,
appendix
c,
says
that
quite
late
in
the
game
they
were
saying,
no
we
didn't.
we
think
it
all
depends
on
a
lot
of
different
circumstances.
so
i'd
appreciate
at
some
point
your
addressing
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right,
so
i
think
if
i
were
in
congress
i
might
have
thought
the
agency
will
resolve
this.
they'll
define
it.
and
i
might
think
as
a
judge
they
know
a
lot
more
about
it
than
i
do.
well,
thinking
that,
how
do
i
decide
this
case?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
can't
find
a
regulation...
i
can
find
a
regulation
that
says
that
diagnostic
services,
when
given
by
a
doctor,
do
get
covered,
but
i
didn't
find
any
other
regulation
that
defined
whether
or
not
a
medical
service
was
or
wasn't
a
medical
service.
i
found
no
other
definition
that
would
help
me
here.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
the
one
that
says,
when
you
diagnose
a
child,
if
a
doctor
diagnoses
a
child,
that
is
a
covered
medical
service.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
take
it
here
we're
not
dealing
with
diagnostic
services.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
therefore,
what
regulation
covers
this
case?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right,
so
that
isn't
what
they
provided.
i
mean,
the
existing
regulations
were
regulations
that
talked
about
when
a
doctor
diagnoses,
like
a
nurse,
is
that
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
the...
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
did
i...
the
one
we
read
before?
in
other
words,
the
one
at
the
end
of
your
brief.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
one
on
page
8a...
all
right.
now,
is
there
any...
is
there
a
way
that
we
can
use
a...
there
are
two
things
that
we
have
to
suggest
this
is
the
agency's
position.
one,
of
course,
is
just
what
you
read,
a
statement,
perhaps
not
too
accurate,
of
what
the
position
previously
had
been
in
a
request
for...
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
comments,
et
cetera,
and
second,
your
brief,
so
if
i
were
to
go
on
those
two
things
i'd
say
yes,
that
is
what
the
agency's...
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
are
we
supposed
to
do
if
i
think,
look,
this
is
a
question
that
cries
out
for
agency
interpretation,
but
the
agency
doesn't
interpret
it,
so
instead
you
have
seven
courts
who
know
little
about
it
going
in
15
different
directions.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
is
the...
what
is
our
ability
to
cure
that
problem?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why
isn't
a...
why
isn't
a
sort
of
vague
rule,
unclear,
et
cetera,
now
interpreted,
better
than
nothing?
