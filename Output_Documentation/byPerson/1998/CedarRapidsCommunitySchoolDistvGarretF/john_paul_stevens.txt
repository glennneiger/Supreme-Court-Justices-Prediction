to
help
assure
that
all
children
with
disabilities
have
available
to
them,
a
free,
appropriate,
public
education
which
emphasizes
special
education
and
related
services
designed
to
meet
their
unique
needs,

education
act,
often
referred
to
as
the
idea,
authorizes
federal
financial
assistance
to
states
that
agree
to
provide
such
children
with
special
education
and
"related
services."
this
case
involves
the
meaning
of
that
term.
respondent,
garret
f.,
is
a
student
in
the
cedar
rapids
community
school
district.
when
he
was
four
years
old,
his
spinal
column
was
severed
in
a
motorcycle
accident.
although
paralyzed
from
the
neck
down,
garret's
mental
capacities
were
unaffected
and
he
attends
regular
classes
at
school.
he
is
able
to
speak,
to
control
his
motorized
wheelchair
and
to
operate
a
computer
with
a
device
that
responds
to
head
movements.
garret
is,
however,
ventilator-dependent.
he
therefore
requires
a
responsible
individual
nearby
to
attend
to
certain
physical
needs
while
he
is
at
school,
such
as,
the
suctioning
of
his
tracheotomy
tube
at
least
once
every
six
hours
and
urinary
and
bladder
catheterization
once
a
day.
in
1993,
garret's
mother
asked
the
district
to
accept
financial
responsibility
for
the
in-school
services
that
garret
requires.
the
district
denied
the
request
believing
that
it
was
not
legally
obligated
to
provide
continuous
one-on-one
nursing
care.
and
in
iowa
department
of
education
hearing,
however,
an
administrative
law
judge
concluded
that
the
idea
requires
the
district
to
bear
the
cost
of
the
requested
services.
the
federal
district
court
agreed
and
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed
based
on
our
decision
in
the
case,
decided
about
15
years
ago
called
by
the
name
of
tatro.
the
court
of
appeals
concluded
that
the
requested
services
are
supportive
services
because
garret
cannot
attend
school
unless
they
are
provided
and
that
the
services
are
not
excluded
as
medical
services.
the
court
explained
that
services
provided
by
a
physician
other
than
for
diagnostic
and
evaluation
purposes
are
subject
to
the
medical
services
exclusion
but
services
that
can
be
provided
by
a
nurse
or
qualified
layperson
are
not.
the
school
district
petitioned
this
court
for
certiorari
arguing
that
the
nursing
care
at
issue
constitutes
medical
services
which
are
excluded
from
the
idea's
related
services
provision.
we
granted
the
district
petition
but
we
now
affirm.
the
idea's
definition
of
related
services
broadly
encompasses
those
supportive
services
that
may
be
required
to
assist
the
child
with
a
disability
to
benefit
from
special
education.
this
general
definition
is
illuminated
by
a
parenthetical
phrase
listing
examples
of
services
that
are
included
within
the
statute's
coverage
including
medical
services
if
not
for
diagnostic
and
evaluation
purposes.
although
the
idea
itself
does
not
define
medical
services,
more
--
more
specifically
in
tatro,
we
concluded
that
the
secretary
of
education
had
reasonably
determined
that
medical
services
referred
to
those
that
must
be
performed
by
a
physician
and
not
the
school
health
services.
we
referenced
the
likely
cost
of
the
services
and
the
competence
of
school
staff
as
justifications
for
drawing
a
line
between
physician
and
other
services,
but
our
endorsement
of
that
line
was
unmistakable.
in
this
case,
the
district
does
not
argue
that
the
services
at
issue
considered
individually
can
be
excluded
from
the
statute's
coverage.
in
fact,
all
of
the
requested
services
may
be
provided
confidently
by
a
school
nurse
or
other
trained
personnel.
instead,
the
district
proposes
a
multi-factor
but
essentially
cost-based
test
to
determine
the
scope
of
the
related
services
provision.
we
acknowledge
that
the
district
may
have
legitimate
financial
concerns
but
the
district's
test
is
supported
by
neither
the
text
of
the
statute
nor
the
regulations
we
upheld
in
tatro
and
the
district
does
not
explain
why
characteristics
such
as
cost
make
one
service
any
more
medical
than
another.
absent
an
elaboration
of
the
statutory
term
is
plainly
more
convincing
than
what
we
reviewed
in
tatro.
there
is
no
reason
to
depart
from
settled
law.
indeed,
accepting
the
district's
cost-based
standard
would
create
tension
with
the
central
purposes
of
the
idea.
in
enacting
the
statute,
congress
intended
to
open
the
doors
of
public
education
to
all
qualified
children
and
required
participating
states
to
educate
--
educate
disabled
children
with
non-disabled
children
whenever
possible.
we
therefore
conclude
that
the
district
must
fund
the
related
services
at
issue
in
order
to
help
guarantee
that
students
like
garret
are
integrated
into
the
public
schools.
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
affirmed.
justice
thomas

filed
a
dissenting
opinion

which
justice
kennedy
