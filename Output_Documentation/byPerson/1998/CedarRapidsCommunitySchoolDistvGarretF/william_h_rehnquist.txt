it's
not
because
the
nurse
lacks
the
competence,
i
take
it,
but
just
because
she's
charged
with
a
number
of
other
responsibilities
as
school
nurse.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
ms.
seitz.

but
there's
also...
you
know,
if
a
parent
sat
up
at
night
with
a
kid
who
had
whooping
cough
waiting
for
him
to
get
into
a
spasm
you
wouldn't
say
the
parent
was
diagnosing
whooping
cough.
you
just
diagnose
whooping
cough
once,
then
you
have
a
lot
of
consequences
from
it.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes.

it?
