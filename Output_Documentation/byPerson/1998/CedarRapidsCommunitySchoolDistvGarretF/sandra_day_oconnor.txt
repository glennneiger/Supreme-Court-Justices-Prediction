justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
but
we
had
the
tatro
decision,
and
it
said
that
was
not
a
medical
service.
i
mean,
we
dealt
with
that,
so
you
have
to
come
to
grips
with
that,
i
think.
are
you
asking
us
to
modify,
or...
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
overrule
tatro?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
that
isn't
what
the
department
has
said.
the
government
doesn't
support
your
position,
the
federal
government,
and
you're
asking
us
to
say
that
continuous
nursing
services
are
medical
services...
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
broken
down
and
doing
it
intermittently
they're
not,
and
that's
a
very
hard
line
to
draw,
as
justice
scalia
has
pointed
out.
i
don't
think
it's
going
to
work.
do
you
have
a
fall-back
position?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
i
guess
these
services
are
acknowledged
in
this
instance
to
be
of
a
continuous
nature,
as
the
petitioner's
lawyer
described,
that
a
nurse
would
have
to
be
there
full-time.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
there
is
an
educational
aide...
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
with
the
child
at
all
times?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
can
that
person
do
any
of
the
listening
or
the
positioning?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
you
say
the
record
in
this
case
shows
that
such
a
person
could
do
these
more
continuous
things.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
that
the
rest
of
it
is
intermittent
need.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
page
what?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
64a?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
if
the
facts
were
different
than
you
say
they
are
in
this
case
and
if,
in
fact,
continuous
care
by
a
registered
nurse
were
necessary
24
hours
a
day,
would
your
answer
be
any
different?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
if
an
ambulance
has
to
stand
by
for
every
hour
the
child
is
at
school,
it's
not
a
physician...
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
the
school
has
to
do
it.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
no,
i'm
asking
some
hypotheticals,
obviously.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
because
you
told
me
that
the
facts
of
this
case
are
different,
but
i
want
to
know
how
far
your
argument
takes
us,
and
would
it
be
different...
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
if
a
nurse
had
to
be
there
full-time
and
the
ambulance
had
to
be
outside
the
school
all
the
time.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i'm
asking
you...
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
what
you
see
are
the
limitations,
if
any.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
while
the
child
is
at
school...
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
full-time
nursing
care
required
and,
if
necessary,
an
ambulance
right
there
in
the
driveway.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
because
of
the
high
risk
of
autonomic
hyperreflexia,
for
example.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
i
guess
the
statute
that
we
look
to
first
is
probably
20
u.s.
code
section
1401(a)(17).
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
it
defines
the
term
related
services,
and
it
says
that
that
means
transportation
and
such
developmental,
corrective,
and
other
supportive
services,
including
speech
pathology,
audiology,
psychological
services,
physical
and
occupational
therapy
and
so
forth.
every
one
of
those
things,
it
seems
to
me,
is
something
that's
given
episodically,
not
continuously.
i
mean,
somebody
has
to
be
transported.
somebody
needs
a
little
speech
pathology
periodically.
someone
needs
therapy
occasionally,
or
counseling
occasionally.
but
nothing
in
that
list
suggests,
does
it,
a
level
of
just,
24-hour-a-day,
or
even
school-hour
day
care?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
where
is
the
statute...
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
it's
unfortunate
that
these
weren't
reproduced
to
help
us
analyze
it.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
has
any
state
refused
to
go
along...
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
with
this
program?
i
thought
they
all
had
gone
along.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
under
the
act,
if
it's
determined
under
the
plan
that
the
child
can't
benefit
from
education
in
the
school
setting
but
could
in
some
other
institutional
setting...
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
the
school
district
is
required
to
provide
that
institutional
care?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
is
there
no...
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
is
there
no
limit,
in
your
view,
to
the
extent
of
nursing
care
services
that
may
have
to
be
provided
to
a
child?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
alternative,
placing
the
child
in
an
institutional
facility,
is
that
required?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
ms.
brinkmann,
a
whole...
a
majority
of
the
courts
of
appeals
have
rejected
your
bright
line
approach.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
mean,
if
we
affirm
here
we
certainly
will
be
going
against
a
majority
of
the
federal
appellate
courts.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
ms.
seitz,
if
the
fact
is
that
if
a
child
needs
so
much
care
that
the
school
district
thinks
that
it
can't
do
it
on
site,
it
may
cost
the
school
district
a
lot
more
money
to
place
the
child
in
institutional
care.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
okay.
