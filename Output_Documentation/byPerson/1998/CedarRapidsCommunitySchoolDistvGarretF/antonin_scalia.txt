justice
antonin
scalia
it
just
depends
on
how
many
school
nurses
you
have.
i
mean,
if
you
have
enough
school
nurses,
it's
no
problem.
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
sort
of
hard
to
think
that,
you
know,
that
that
makes
a
difference
in
the
nature
of
the
service.
justice
antonin
scalia
oh,
i
would
assume
nonprivate
duty
nursing
as
well.
i
mean,
what
i...
i
can
understand
the
reasonableness
of
your
position
when
you
say
that
nursing
services
are
medical
services,
but
you
don't
say
that.
you
say,
we
can
do
cic,
and
the
trouble
is,
we
can't
do
too
much
of
it,
and
i
don't
know
that
the
word
medical
has
anywhere
in
it
the
distinction
between...
a
distinction
in
volume.
if
you
do
more
of
it,
it
becomes
medical.
if
you
do
less
of
it,
it's
not
medical.
it's
either
medical
or
not.
i
mean,
cic
is
either
medical
or
not,
so
you...
it
seems
to
me
you
have
to
say
nurses...
you
know,
nursing
services,
at
least
cic,
is
not
covered.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
you're
not
really
willing
to
do
that,
because
you're
not
willing
to
say
that
all
services
involving
the
physical
well-being
of
a
student
that
are
provided
by
nurses
or
anyone
else,
you're
not
willing
to
say
that
they're
medical
services.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
but
i'm
talking
about
medical
services
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute.
that's
the
only...
justice
antonin
scalia
you're
saying
we
went
as
far
as
we
did
in
tatro
only
because
there
was
a
regulation
that
pushed
us
that
far,
and
that
the
regulation
doesn't
push
us
any
further.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
know,
even
if
i
don't
accept...
even
if
we
reject
what
is
the
nice
bright
line
test
that's
expressed
in
tatro...
justice
antonin
scalia
it
certainly
is
expressed
there,
hospitals
and
doctors.
do
i
have
to
go
all
the
way
to
your,
over
to...
i
hate
multi-factor
tests.
i...
you
know.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
can
we...
can
you
give
us
any
other
clearer
line?
i
mean,
what,
normal
school
nursing
services,
or...
justice
antonin
scalia
if
most
of
this
is
just
listening
to
see
whether
he
needs
assistance,
why
doesn't
that
come
under
the
diagnostic
exception
to
the
medical
exception?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
think
you're
mistaking
my
question,
because
it
is
not
a
hostile
question.
justice
antonin
scalia
even
if
these
were
medical
services,
since
you
say
most
of
the
time
they're
not
doing
anything
except
listening
to
see
whether
he
needs
medical
assistance,
now,
i
would
take
listening
to
see
if
he
needs
medical
assistance
to
be
diagnostic,
and
diagnostic
services
are
excepted
from
the
exception
for
medical
services.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
it's
not
diagnostic
unless
it's
done
by
a
physician.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't,
either.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
page
are
you
on?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
know,
actually
i
suppose
we
really
don't
begin
with
the
definition
of
related
services,
but
we
probably
begin
with
a
provision
that
uses
related
services,
and
that
reads,
the
term
free
appropriate
public
education
means
special
education
and
related
services,
and
i
suppose
in
attacking
this
problem
we
should
regard
that
whole
phrase,
special
education
and
related
services.
justice
antonin
scalia
okay,
and
then
it
defines
related
services
to
mean
transportation
and
such
developmental,
corrective,
and
other
supportive
services,
including
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah,
as
may
be
required
to
assist
a
child
with
disability
to
benefit
from
special
education.
i
mean,
i
guess
keeping
him
alive
would
assist
him
to
benefit
from
special
education,
but
i
don't
think
that's
what
was
meant
by
related
services.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
what's
necessary
to
enable
him
to
benefit.
i
mean,
he
has
a
disability
that
distinctively
prevents
his
making
use
of
the
educational
facilities,
but
i
don't...
to
say
that
making
sure
the
person
can
stay
alive...
justice
antonin
scalia
is
a
related
service,
it
seems
to
me
a
great
stretch.
justice
antonin
scalia
oh,
i
don't
think
it's
a
broad
definition.
i
mean,
you
can
say
tatro
is
a
broad
decision,
but
the
definition
says,
transportation
and
other
supportive
services
as
may
be
required
to
assist
a
child
with
a
disability
to
benefit
from
special
education.
justice
antonin
scalia
now,
that
would
include
enabling
him
to
move
around
the
room,
enabling
him
to
use
books
and
so
forth,
but
to
say
keeping
him
alive
is
part
of
it,
i
mean,
that
just
expands
related
services...
justice
antonin
scalia
beyond
any
limitation.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
of
course.
i
mean,
that's
my
point.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
certainly
shouldn't
have
taken
2-1/2
years
to
write
such
an
unhelpful
letter.
justice
antonin
scalia
what's
the
date
of
tatro?
did
that
amendment
come
before
or
after
tatro
was
on
the
books?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
we
didn't
know
at
that
time
that
what
those
regulations
meant
was
tatro.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
doesn't
mean
that
congress
knew
what
those
rights
were.
they
just
knew,
whatever
they
were,
we
don't
want
them
lessened.
