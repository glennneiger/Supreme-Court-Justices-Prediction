justice
david
h.
souter
well,
isn't
it
also...
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
but
you...
it
seems
to
me
you,
even
on
that
assumption
you've
got
a
problem,
because
the
testimony
in
the
case
was,
as
i
understand
it,
that
you
don't
even
need
a
nurse
to
do
this.
my
recollection
is
that
the
alj
found
that
any,
you
know,
competent
person
could
be
trained
to
do
these
things.
the
reason,
as
i
understand
it,
that
a
nurse
would
be
required
in
iowa
is
because
the
iowa
nursing
regulations
so
provide,
but
it
seems
to
me
that's
iowa's
problem
and
it
doesn't
have
anything
to
do
with
the
way
we
should
draw
the
definitional
line
under
the
statute.
so
that
even
on
your
assumption,
that
the
statute
said
in
effect,
or
meant,
that
continuous
service
by
a
nurse
would
be
within
the
exclusion,
that
in
fact
is
not
the
case
here
except
under
the
iowa
regulations,
and
surely
the
iowa
regulations
can't
govern
the
meaning
of
the
federal
statute.
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
then
the
criterion
then
is
not
the
continuous
nature
of
the
service
or
the,
in
effect
the
ultimate
cost,
it
is
in
a
more
strictly
analytical
sense
it's
the
kind
of
service
itself.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
that's
right,
but
because
on
the
assumption
of
the
bright
line
test,
what
the
bright
line
is
drawn
between
is
what,
i
presume,
in
fact
doctors
do
and
what,
in
fact,
nurses
do,
but
it
seems
to
me
that
that
doesn't
necessarily
implicate
the
point
that
i
was
trying
to
make
earlier.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
i
don't
understand
that.
i
mean,
we
would
look
to
see
who's
doing
the
procedure,
and
if
in
your
state
nurses
are
doing
it,
that
would
be
the
end
of
the
issue.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
it
would
mean
that
if
there
is
some
procedure
that
can
only
be
performed
by
a
doctor,
and
a
doctor
would
have
to
come
in
once
a
day
to
do
it,
and
it
was
not
diagnostic,
et
cetera,
then
it
would
be
excluded.
i
don't
know
how
many
such
procedures
there
might
be,
but
certainly
the
test
would
have
meaning.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
i
thought
the
simple
requirement
to
have
an
attendant
of
any
sort
would
be
a
continuous
care
requirement.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
it
wouldn't...
it
certainly
wouldn't
be
medical.
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
i
thought
your
statement
was
merely
that
any
continuous
care
that
might
occur
in
a
situation
like
this
would
be
medical,
and
in
fact
he's
getting
continuous
care
right
now,
isn't
he?
justice
david
h.
souter
yes.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
if
it
were
being
provided
under
this
section,
that
would
be
medical,
too.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
it
would
be
provided
as
a
related
service,
wouldn't
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
the...
i'm
not
sure
that
i
have
the
proper
term,
but
i
thought
there
was
some
individual
who
attended
this
student
at
all
times...
justice
david
h.
souter
to
move
around,
and
so
on.
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
justice
david
h.
souter
if
that
were
provided
under
this
section,
would
you
call
that
medical
service
because
it
was
continuous?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
i
thought
you
had
said
earlier
that
if
in
fact
the
service
is
continuous,
you
really
couldn't
conceive
of
a
service
that
would
not
therefore
be
medical,
and
i'm
saying,
if
it
were
provided
under
this
section
it
would
be
medical,
then,
on
your
test,
wouldn't
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay,
then
continuity
is
not
itself
a
criterion,
and
the
only
thing
that
continuity
goes
to,
i
guess,
is
the
likelihood
of
the
expense
which
is
going
to
follow
the
continuity,
is
that
about
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
it's
a
bottom
line
test.
justice
david
h.
souter
may
i
go
back
to
your
assertion
about
the
regulations?
one
of
the
appendices
has
the
so-called
1996
letter
in
it,
and
that
certainly
is
not
a
bright
line...
that
is
not
an
example
of
the
department
administering
a
bright
line
test.
at
the
time
of
tatro,
however,
i
understood
they
were
following
a
bright
line,
and
i'm
not
sure
that
there...
and
tatro
as
i
read
the
case
endorsed
that
as
a
reading
of
the
regulation.
apart
from
the
1996
letter,
is
there
clear
evidence
that
they
are...
that
the
department
is
following
a
multi-factor
as
opposed
to
a
bright
line
approach?
justice
david
h.
souter
so
they
didn't
have
to
get
to
the
bright
line
versus
multi-factored...
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
assuming,
then,
that's
the...
sort
of
the
state
of
the
administrative
record,
don't
we
have
to
confront
tatro
in
this
way:
tatro
seems
to
involve
a
recognition,
an
endorsement
of
the...
what
the
court
then
understood
to
be
the
department's
bright
line
approach
to
interpreting
the
statute
once
the
regulation
has
so
been
approved
by
a
decision
of
this
court,
doesn't
the
agency
have
to
go
through
some
procedure
to
amend
its
regulation
if
it's
going
to
change
its
interpretive
approach?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
it
hasn't
done
it
here,
has
it?
i
mean,
the
only
thing
we've
got
is
the
1996
letter,
and
that
may
express
uncertainty
or
confusion
on
the
part
of
whoever
wrote
that
letter,
but
it
certainly
doesn't
rise
to
the
level
of
the
department's
formally
reassessing
its
interpretive
stance.
