justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
ms.
seitz,
i
follow
what
you're
saying,
but
we
do
have
the
tatro
case,
and
i
would
have
said
in
one
sense
the
cic
is
a
medical
service,
so
it
seems
to
me,
at
least
from
your
brief,
that
you're
not
resting
on
the
character
of
the
care
that's
rendered...
is
it
a
catheter,
or
what
it
is...
but
the
volume
of
it
and
the
cost,
so
it's...
the
nature
of
the
service
seems
to
be
not
part
of
your
calculus.
in
other
words,
if
you
took
this
string
of
care-giving
and
you
broke
it
down
and
you
just
had
one,
would
you
say,
oh,
that's
not...
that's
a
medical
service,
it's
not
diagnostic?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
my
question
to
you
is,
are
you
saying
every
one
of
these
services
on
the
list
fits
within
the
medical
service
exception,
or
they
do
cumulatively
but
not
individually?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
then
you...
you
seem
to
be
going
back
on
what
i
thought
was
very
candid
and
clear
of
you
earlier
when
you
said,
if
we
took
each
one
of
these,
the
tracheotomy,
each
one
separately,
it
would
be
a
related
service
that
wasn't
within
the
medical
exception,
but
when
you
cumulate
them
altogether,
it's
the
all-day,
continuous,
that
makes
it
medical
service,
so
it
seems
to
me
you
were
not...
your
line
depends
upon
duration
and
expense,
and
not
the
character
of
the
individual
services...
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
in
the
package.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
then
what
gave
chief
justice
burger
the
misimpression
which
he
evidently
had
on
your
argument?
he
said,
i
understand
this
line
because
doctors
are
expensive
and
hospitals
are
expensive,
so
he
must
have
thought
that
without
this
exception
some
things
that
doctors
only
do
and
some
things
that
are
done
only
in
the
hospital
could
have
been
covered.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes,
but
when
he
talked
about
where
the
line
is
drawn,
he
said,
doctors
cost
a
lot
of
money
and
hospitals
cost
a
lot
of
money.
now,
you
are
now
telling
us
that
doctors
and
hospitals
just
don't
fit
into
this
picture,
so
was
he
wrong
in
the
impression
that
he
had
that
they
somehow
would
have
but
for
this
medical
services
exception?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you're
recognizing
that
he
wasn't
dealing
with
an
imaginary
case
when
he
thought
that
doctors
and
hospitals
could
have
been
part
of
this
picture.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
if
but
for
this
exception,
because
he
mentioned
them
in
his
opinion.
he
said,
you
see,
those
things
are
very
expensive,
so
i
understand
that
congress
wouldn't
want
them
to
be
covered.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
keep
saying
multi-factor
test,
but
it
seems
to
me
in
all
candor
that
your
argument
comes
down
to,
all
day
is
too
much,
and
we
have
brackets
on
this
target.
cic,
once
a
day,
twice
a
day,
not
too
much,
all
day,
too
much,
and
then
there
may
be
cases
in
between.
but
it
seems
to
me
what
you're
arguing
is
the
all
day
is
the
other
extreme,
and
so
it's
duration,
all
day
is
the
most
it
could
be,
and
expense,
because
it's
all
the
hours
of
the
day.
so
you
keep
talking
about
multi-factor
tests,
but
we
have
this
case,
and
i'm
trying
to
understand
your
position.
it
isn't
based
on
the
character
of
the
care,
but
it's
duration
and
expense.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
on
that,
in
your
response
to
justice
scalia
are
you
saying
that
we
should
overrule
the
tatro
case,
because
that's
what
you
seem
to
be
saying
if
you
say
that
all
of
these
are
really
medical
service.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
don't
follow
that,
because...
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
diagnostic
is
covered,
even
if
it's
a
physician.
i
thought
the
purpose
was
to
rule
out
things
that
were
medical
but
not
diagnostic.
in
other
words,
anybody
can
do...
diagnostic
is
covered
by
the
statute.
it's
in
this
nondiagnostic
area
that
we
have
a
problem,
isn't
that
so?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes,
so
if
it's
diagnostic,
whoever
does
it
it
comes...
it's
covered.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
that's
what
this
case
at
this
stage
turns
on,
because
as
i
understand
it
this
child
was
in
school
with
these
services
being...
the
tab
being
picked
up
by
something
other
than
the
school
district's
funds,
and
now
the...
one
of
the
answers
that
we
have
from
the
school
district
is,
oh,
don't
worry,
there'll
be
other
funds
to
keep
this
child
in
school,
but
if
you
have
to
use
our
funds,
then
the
alternative
is
home
instruction,
and
how
would
that...
what
would...
how
would
the
home
instruction
work?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
ms.
brinkmann,
i
find
it
difficult
to
accept
that,
for
this
simple
reason.
if
there
had
been
this
bright
line
physician-nonphysician,
you
would
expect
that
to
be
broadcast
all
over
the
agency
so
that
when...
bright
line
test,
easy
for
all
the
administrators.
you
would
never
get
a
letter
like
that
letter
in
'96.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
where
does
it
say
there's
a
bright
line
between
physician
and
nonphysician?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
your
position
is
clear
in
your
brief.
i
have
seen
nothing
from
the
agency
that
was
clear
up
until
the
position
that
it
is
now
taking
in
this
court.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
is
there
any
information
in
the
population
that's
covered
by
this
statute,
how
many
children,
or
what
percentage
would
require
the
continuous
care?
