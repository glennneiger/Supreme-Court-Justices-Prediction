ms.
susan
l.
seitz
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
federal
statute,
the
individuals
with
disabilities
education
act,
specifically
provides
that
school
districts
are
not
required
to
provide
medical
services
to
students
except
for
evaluation
and
diagnostic
purposes.
therefore,
the
fundamental
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
nursing
services
which
must
be
continuous
and
exclusive
for
one
student
constitutes
medical
services.
when
we
go
to
a
physician's
office
and
we
see
a
nurse,
and
the
nurse
gives
us
an
injection,
we
certainly
think
we're
getting
a
medical
service.
similarly,
if
we
go
to
a
dialysis
clinic
and
a
technician
administers
dialysis
we
think
we're
getting
medical
services.
ms.
susan
l.
seitz
justice
ginsburg,
catheterization,
even
clean
intermittent
catheterization,
is
also
commonly
thought
of
as
a
medical
service.
however,
we
have
to
find
a
balance
between
those
things
that
are
the
broad
medical
service
and
those
things
which
are
school
nursing
services
which
are
required
under
the
regulations
as
a
related
service,
so
somehow
we
have
to
find
a
test
that
will
be,
what
is
a
school
health
service
provided
by
a
school
nurse
versus
those
things
that
are
just
generally
thought
of
as
medical?
certainly,
cic,
as
this
court
found,
was
a
service
that
could
be
provided
by
a
school
nurse
in
a
short
period
of
time.
in
fact,
amber
tatro
was
the
young
girl
and
was
quickly
going
to
be
able
to...
ms.
susan
l.
seitz
justice
ginsburg,
we're
saying
they
do
cumulatively,
because
obviously
the
cedar
rapids
community
school
district
does
provide
clean
intermittent
catheterization
to
other
students.
they
also
section
tracheostomies
for
other
students.
but
the
difference
is,
those
are
services
that
can
be
done
by
a
school
nurse,
or
someone
trained
by
the
school
nurse,
versus
having
to
hire
a
person
full-time
to
attend
to
that
child
all
day.
ms.
susan
l.
seitz
yes,
your
honor.
the...
if
it
was
just...
in
fact,
we
have
other
students
in
the
cedar
rapids
district
who
have
suction
of
tracheostomy
tubes.
that
by
itself
could
be
done
by
a
school
nurse,
and
that
school
nurse
could
continue
to
perform
his
or
her
other
functions.
the
difference
with
garrett
is
that
he
needs
continuous
monitoring
and
assessment
to
make
sure
that
he's
not
in
respiratory
distress,
and
at
that
point
then
the
school
nurse
cannot
perform
those
functions.
there
are
only
six
nurses
in
cedar
rapids.
ms.
susan
l.
seitz
mr.
chief
justice,
that
would
be
correct.
ms.
susan
l.
seitz
i'm
sorry.
ms.
susan
l.
seitz
actually,
your
honor,
you
would
have...
ms.
susan
l.
seitz
your
honor,
i
don't
believe
it
makes
a
difference
in
the
nature
of
the
service.
it's
either
medical
or
it's
not
medical,
but
we
need
to
find
a
way
to
give
credence
to
the
agency
definition
of
school
health
services,
which
we
are
not
contesting
that
school
health
services
are
related
services.
however...
ms.
susan
l.
seitz
your
honor,
first,
you're
correct
that
the
iowa
board
of
nursing
did
rule
his
care
needed
to
be
provided
by
a
nurse.
however,
the
services
that
could
be
delegated,
even
to
a
lay
person,
are
clearly
medical
services
that
would
typically
be
either
performed
or
supervised
by
the
nurse.
ms.
susan
l.
seitz
we're
proposing
a
multi-factored
test,
your
honor,
that
would
be
both...
ms.
susan
l.
seitz
your
honor...
ms.
susan
l.
seitz
i'm
sorry.
your
honor,
we
need
to
determine
the
character
first
to
determine
whether
it's
medical.
then
we
need
to
apply
other
factors
to
see
if
it
comes
under
the
school
health.
ms.
susan
l.
seitz
no...
excuse
me?
that
it
is
medical...
ms.
susan
l.
seitz
excuse
me.
it
would
still
be
a
medical
service,
but
it
would
come
under
the
school
health
rather
than
the
medical
services
exemption.
i'd
also
like
to
come
back
to
justice
souter's
comment
about
state
licensure.
even
the
physician-nonphysician
bright
line
would
come
down
to
a
state
licensure
issue,
because
states
obviously
allow
nurse
practitioners,
they
allow
physician
assistants
to
perform
services,
so
even
under
the
physician-nonphysician
there's
going
to
be
some
looking
at
state
statutes.
ms.
susan
l.
seitz
your
honor,
if,
in
fact,
it
were
physician-nonphysician
bright
line,
it's
difficult
to
comprehend
how
there
would
be
any
meaning
given
to
the
statutory
exclusion.
what
services
would
a
physician...
ms.
susan
l.
seitz
but
what
physician
services
would
be
necessary
during
a
school
day,
at
school,
to
enable
a
child
to
benefit
from
education.
if
it
really
is,
it's
only
physician
services,
we
render
that
statutory
provision
meaningless.
physicians
see
patients
in
clinics,
in
doctor's
offices,
in
hospitals.
ms.
susan
l.
seitz
your
honor,
we
cannot
conceive
of
any
procedure
that
a
physician
would
have
to
come
in
and
perform
for
a
student
during...
ms.
susan
l.
seitz
justice
burger
in
the
tatro
case
indicated
that
cic
could
be
done
by
a
school
nurse
or
a
lay
person.
ms.
susan
l.
seitz
no.
we
are
in
agreement
with
justice
burger
that
they
carved
out
physician's
services
because
of
cost,
but
we
also
believe
that
medical
services
was
never
intended
to
mean
only
physicians.
certainly
one-on-one
nursing
all
day...
this
case
indicates
$20
to
$30,000
a
year...
could
be
more
costly
than
a
physician.
ms.
susan
l.
seitz
that
doctors
and
hospitals
could
be
part
of
the
included
services,
or...
ms.
susan
l.
seitz
i
believe
justice
burger
said
that
the
agency
definition
of
included
services
which
made
a
distinction
between
physicians
and
nonphysicians,
and
then
went
on
to
say
in
tatro
that
they
have
carved
out
physician's
services
because
it
added
additional
expense
to
districts.
but
in
fact
if
we
use
that
analysis,
the
additional
expense
to
districts
of
intensive
nursing
services
would
be
greater
than
what
an
intermittent
physician's
service
could
be.
we
also
have
to
remember
that
this
court
decided
in
the
rowley
case
in
1982
that
the
idea
was
in
the
nature
of
a
contract
with
the
states
and,
as
such,
that
any
conditions
attached
to
the
funding
must
be
unambiguously
stated.
this
is
particularly
true
in
education,
which
is
traditionally
left
to
states
and
localities.
congress
did
not
specifically
list
in
section
17
that
nursing
services
would
be
provided,
and
we
would
have
to
assume
that
there
is
some
indication
in
the
act
itself
that
felt...
they
did
not
think
it
should
be
provided.
if
you
look
at
the
literal
language
of
the
statute
it
says
that
all
corrective,
developmental,
and
supporting
services
needed
to
allow
a
child
to
benefit
from
education
is
included,
and
then
it
has
some
medical
service
exclusion.
but
congress
went
on
and
gave
some
specific
listings
such
as
physical
therapy,
occupational
therapy,
social
work
services,
psychological
services.
if
congress
had
intended
for
medical
services
to
be
a
narrow
definition
of
physical
physician's
services
they
would
not
have
needed
to
list
all
those
specific
ones,
because
it
would
have
been
covered
under
any
supportive
service.
however,
a
better
interpretation
would
be
that
they
intended
a
broad
definition
of
medical
and
then
listed
those
in
order
that
they
would
be
provided.
ms.
susan
l.
seitz
whether
one-on-one
nursing
is
a
medical
service,
your
honor?
we
believe
that
any...
any
definition
of
medical
services,
whether
you
look
to
the
internal
revenue
code,
where
you
look
to
worker
comp,
have
always
viewed
private
duty
type
nursing
as
a
medical
service,
and
suddenly
we're
asking
in
this
statute
to
give
it
an
uncommon
meaning
and
say,
no,
medical
means
only
physicians.
ms.
susan
l.
seitz
justice
scalia,
actually
i
don't
think
there's
any
question
that
cic
is
a
medical
service
in
common
understanding.
however,
we...
ms.
susan
l.
seitz
justice
o'connor,
we're
in
agreement...
ms.
susan
l.
seitz
we're
in
agreement
with
the
result
of
tatro.
we're
not
asking
you
to
overrule
the
result
in
tatro.
we
do
believe
that
the
department
of
education
could
legitimately
say
to
school
districts,
you
have
school
nurses,
and
they
should
provide
some
school
health
services.
they
are
still
medical
services,
as
justice
scalia...
ms.
susan
l.
seitz
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
susan
l.
seitz
your
honor,
we
believe
that
if
we
allow
a
multi-factor
test
to
be
used,
where
you
can
determine
whether
school
nurses
who
traditionally
serve
hundreds...
in
fact,
the
ratio
is
1
to
3,000
students...
can
do
the
services,
that
it
would
be
treated
as
a
school
health
service
under
the
regulations.
i
agree
that
it
would
be
easier
to
say
it's
either
all
medical
or
not
medical,
but
this
court
in
tatro
determined
that
the
school
health
service
regulation
was
a
reasonable
regulation,
so
therefore
we
have
to
find
where
is
the
limit
drawn
when
it
quits
being
a
reasonable
school
health
service
and
becomes
a
medical
service,
and
that's
why
we
have
proposed
the
multi-factor
test
at
looking
at...
ms.
susan
l.
seitz
yes,
your
honor.
that
becomes
the
determining
factor.
once
you
determine
that
the
character
of
the
care
is
medical...
which
i
think
as
justice
scalia
pointed
out,
even
cic,
it's
either
medical
or
it
isn't...
once
you
determine
that
it's
medical,
then
you
need
to
make
that
multi-factor.
however,
i
agree
that
i
cannot
conceive
of
any
situation
where
it's
continuous
care
that
would
not
make
it
fall
under
the
medical
services
exception.
ms.
susan
l.
seitz
that's
correct.
ms.
susan
l.
seitz
they'd
still
be
performing
medical
functions.
assessing
whether
he's
in
respiratory
distress,
suctioning
a
tracheotomy,
catheterizing
the
student,
positioning
the
student...
ms.
susan
l.
seitz
i'm
sorry,
that's
because
the
continuous
care
that
he's
getting...
you're
referring
to
the
educational
associate
the
district's
providing...
ms.
susan
l.
seitz
that
helps
him
move
about
the
building,
manipulate
materials.
that's
because
that's
being
provided
under
the
special
education
section,
not
the
related
service.
ms.
susan
l.
seitz
if
it
were
being
provided
as
a
related
service.
if
you
look
at
the
other...
ms.
susan
l.
seitz
you
mean
now
the
educational
continuous
care,
or
the
nursing
continuous
care?
i'm
sorry.
ms.
susan
l.
seitz
there
are
actually
two...
ms.
susan
l.
seitz
there
are
actually
two
individuals
who
attend
this
child
all
the
time.
there's
one
provided
by
the
school
district,
who...
ms.
susan
l.
seitz
helps
him
with
his
materials,
raise
his
hand,
move
him
about
the
building.
ms.
susan
l.
seitz
i
don't
know
how
to
answer
that,
because
it's
purely
an
educational...
ms.
susan
l.
seitz
actually,
no,
your
honor,
because
you
first
have
to
make
the
initial
determination
of
what
the
nature
of
the
care
is,
and
if
he's
helping
him
move
materials,
raise
his
hand,
manipulate
the
computer,
nobody's
arguing
that's
a
medical
service.
ms.
susan
l.
seitz
your
honor...
ms.
susan
l.
seitz
no,
i
don't
think
that's
it.
i
think
you
have
to
first
make
the
nature
test,
and
then
you
have
to
go
to
the
continuity.
ms.
susan
l.
seitz
actually
i
think
they
are
medical
services
for
determining
the
nature,
but
we
also
need
to
look
at
the
school
health
service...
ms.
susan
l.
seitz
actually,
the
easiest
argument
would
be
that
all
medical
services
that
are
traditionally
thought
of
are
medical,
are
medical
and
are
excluded
and
the
school
health
service
goes
too
far.
okay,
the
other
thing
that
we
would
like
to
point
out
is
that
the
other
things
on
the
list
of
the
related
services
such
as
ot,
physical
therapy,
social
work
services
are
all
intermittent
care.
they're
not
continuous
care.
i
think
that
gives
some
indication
of
congress'
intent
when
they
use
the
term
medical,
that
they
did
not
mean
for
it
to
be
continuous
services.
also,
unfortunately
the
legislative
record
does
not
give
us
much
of
a
discussion
of
why
medical
services
was
ever
put
into
the
act.
in
fact,
when
it
was
first
proposed
in
bill
form
senate
6
and
the
house
file
included
medical
services.
it
was
then
excluded,
but
there's
no
discussion
in
the
record
of
why.
but
there
was
a
lot
of
discussion
of
the
cost
of
special
ed,
so
i
think
the
only
plausible
explanation
can
be
that
congress
did
not
want
school
districts
to
intrude
into
areas
they
had
not
historically
performed
that
had
historically
been
paid
by
other
payers,
which
would
also
give
some
legitimacy
to
a
broad
definition
of
medical
services.
ms.
susan
l.
seitz
they
are.
all
of
those
services
are
really
medical
services,
but
we
don't
believe
you
have
to
overrule
tatro
to
get
to
the
result
in
our
case,
because
there
was
already
deference
given
in
tatro
to
the
school
health
regulation,
and
school
districts
can
do
the
school
health
regulation,
but
they
need
guidance
on
what
they're
to
do
beyond
those
simple
services
that
can
be
done
on
an
intermittent
basis
by
existing
personnel.
ms.
susan
l.
seitz
that's
correct,
justice
scalia.
okay.
also
the
regulations
themselves,
which
even
the
department
of
education
has
not
interpreted
as
requiring
a
bright
line
test
until
this
particular
case
surfaced
does
give
us
some
indi...
even
if
we
follow
those
regulations,
does
give
us
some
indication
that
continuous
one-on-one
service
were
not
required.
ms.
susan
l.
seitz
actually
the
1996
letter,
one
of
which
is
attached
to
our
petition
for
certiorari,
were
the
only
times
that
the
department
was
asked
whether
one-on-one
continuous
nursing,
or
in
fact
nursing
services
at
all,
were
required.
the
earlier
letter
ruling
had
to
do
with
psychotherapy
services,
and
that's
because
psychological
services
were
also
listed
in
the
statute.
ms.
susan
l.
seitz
they
really
didn't,
and
in
fact
they
applied
what
looked
like
a
bright
line
on
the
included
psychotherapy
services,
because
you
have
the
psychologist,
the
medical
service
distinction.
ms.
susan
l.
seitz
absolutely,
your
honor.
ms.
susan
l.
seitz
your
honor,
first
i
think
the
tatro
case
actually
approved
the
included
definition
of
medical
services
as
services
by
a
physician
for
purposes
of
evaluation
and
diagnosis.
it
didn't
deal
with
the
excluded...
all
it
is
is,
it
has
that
footnote
10
that
says
presumably
excluded
services
would
be
services
by
a
physician
for
other
services.
so
this
court
even
in
tatro
did
not
adopt...
and
there
isn't
a
regulation
on
excluded
services,
so
the
court
clearly
did
not
adopt
an
excluded
bright
line
physician-nonphysician
test.
ms.
susan
l.
seitz
yes.
ms.
susan
l.
seitz
no,
we
don't
think
you
do
have
to...
ms.
susan
l.
seitz
actually,
we
would
be
happy
to
give
that
line,
and
a
line
that
particularly
was
drawn
at
continuous
one-on-one
which,
other
than
physician
services,
is
the
most
intensive
medical
services
you
can
get.
a
nurse
for
just
you?
certainly
there
can
be
a
line
drawn
there
to
say,
that's
medical.
unless
there's
further
questions
right
now,
i'd
like
to...
ms.
susan
l.
seitz
yes.
ms.
susan
l.
seitz
of
special
education?
ms.
susan
l.
seitz
yes,
i
do.
ms.
susan
l.
seitz
uh-huh.
ms.

yes,
and
in
fact
the
law
requires
multidisciplinary
assessments
as
well.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
i
reserve
my
time?
ms.
susan
l.
seitz
thank
you.
ms.
susan
l.
seitz
thank
you.
i
would
like
to
address
just
a
couple
of
questions
that
were
raised
of
my
colleague,
ms.
brinkmann.
i
believe
that
justice
scalia
asked
why
if
a
nurse
is
making
assessments
of
his
health
condition
that
doesn't
fall
under
the
exception
to
the
exception.
that's
because
the
diagnostic
and
evaluation
services
referred
to
in
the
statute
are
diagnostic
and
evaluation
services
for
determining
eligibility
for
special
education
under
the
act.
it's
not
dealing
with
diagnosis
and
evaluation
of
a
medical
condition
for
medical
treatment.
okay,
i'd
also
like
to
deal
with
ms.
brinkmann's
discussion
of
the
agency
proposed
rule-making
in
1982...
excuse
me.
i'm
looking,
and
i...
this
is
not
cited
in
any
of
the
appendix,
so
i'm
going
to
have
to
give
you
a
citation
to
the
federal
register.
it's
volume
47,
and
it
appears
at
page
33,838,
probably...
excuse
me.
33846
through
33848.
in
fact,
the
proposed
agency
regulations
in
1982,
it
says
in
the
prelude,
the
prologue
to
the
proposed
regulation,
the
most
persistent
problems
involve
determining
whether
certain
health-related
services
are
to
be
provided,
clearly
finding
that
there
was
confusion
over
what
was
a
medical
service,
over
what
was
a
related
service.
it
does
not
say
there
was
a
longstanding
bright
line
rule
going
back
to
1977.
nor
do
i
think
you
can
look
at
the
statutory
amendment
in
'83
as
ratifying
the
bright
line,
because
if
you
look
at
the
proposed
regulation
in
the
area
of
medical
services,
what
was
being
proposed
by
the
secretary
in
1982
was
to
exclude
all
life
sustaining
procedures
that
could
be
performed
under
sterile
conditions...
that
would
be
cic.
it
would
have
been
clearly
excluded...
must
be
administered
by
licensed
health
care
professionals,
would
have
excluded
all
school
nursing
services,
medication
administration.
just
because
congress
went
on
in
1983
and
said
you
can't
lessen
the
procedural
or
substantive
rights,
i
don't
think
you
can
say
they
endorsed
a
bright
line
physician-non...
ms.
susan
l.
seitz
that's
correct,
and
there
were
six
areas,
not
just
related
services
that
were
being
proposed,
amendments.
i
don't
think
we
can
draw
any
conclusion
from
that
legislative
amendment
in
'83.
ms.
susan
l.
seitz
that
would
be
helpful.
i
don't
think
that
we
can...
when
ms.
brinkmann
said
that
we
have
not
cited
any
agency
regulation
on
excluded...
any
agency
interpretation
on
excluded
medical
services,
i
agree,
there
aren't
any
agency
regulations
or
interpretations
on
excluded,
so
you
have
to
look
to
the
case
law.
that's
why
we've
had
six
circuits.
ms.
susan
l.
seitz
unfortunately,
there
really
isn't.
the
stat...
the
federal
statute,
unlike
our
state
statute,
has
specific
categories
of
disabilities.
most
of
these
children,
though
not
necessarily
all
of
them,
would
come
under
other
health-impaired,
and
all
we
know
is
that
5
percent
of
those
treated
are
treated
as
other
health-impaired,
but
we
don't
have
any
statistics...
ms.
susan
l.
seitz
okay,
i'm
glad
you
brought
that
up,
because
i
wanted
to
respond
to
your
question
on
that,
justice
o'connor.
what
the
statute
provides
is
that
the
district
has
to
provide...
may
i
finish
my
answer?
ms.
susan
l.
seitz
okay.
has
to
provide
educational
and
related
services
in
homes,
hospitals,
institutions.
they
don't
pay
for
the
institution.
they
provide
the
educational
and
related
services.
ms.
susan
l.
seitz
thank
you.
