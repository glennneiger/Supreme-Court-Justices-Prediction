in

98-531,
florida
prepaid
versus
college
savings.
in
1992,
congress
amended
the
patent
laws
and
expressly
abrogated
the
immunity
of
the
states'
from
claims
of
patent
infringement.
the
respondent
college
savings,
which
justice
scalia
described
in
his
announcement,
then
sued
the
state
of
florida
for
patent
infringement,
and
the
state
of
florida
argued
that
congress
exceeded
its
power
in
abrogating
the
state's
immunity.
the
united
states
intervened
to
defend
the
constitutionality
of
the
law.
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
congress
had
validly
abrogated
the
state
sovereign
immunity
from
the
infringement
suits
pursuant
to
its
authority
under
section
5
of
the
fourteenth
amendment,
and
we
granted
certiorari
and
we
now
reverse.
congress
justified
its
abrogation
of
state
immunity
from
patent
infringement
suits
under
three
sources
of
constitutional
authority:
the
patent
clause,
the
commerce
clause
and
article
v
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
our
decision
in
seminole
tribe
against
florida
three
years
ago
makes
it
clear
that
congress
may
not
abrogate
state
sovereignty
immunity
pursuant
to
its
article
i
powers,
and
hence
the
patent
clause
and
the
commerce
clause
cannot
support
the
legislation
here.
recognizing
this,
the
respondents
nonetheless
argued
that
the
amendment
was
intended
to
secure
the
fourteenth
amendment's
protections
against
depravation
of
property
without
due
process
of
law.
in
the
case
of
city
of
boerne
against
flores
however,
decided
two
years
ago,
we
held
it
for
congress
to
invoke
its
enforcement
powers
under
the
fourteenth
amendment,
it
must
identify
conduct
transgressing
the
fourteenth
amendment’s
substantive
provisions,
and
must
tailor
its
legislative
scheme
to
remedying
or
preventing
such
conduct.
yet
in
abrogating
state
immunity
from
infringement
suits,
congress
identified
no
pattern
of
patent
infringement
on
the
part
of
the
state,
let
alone
a
pattern
of
depriving
patent
owners
of
their
property
without
due
process
of
law.
patent
infringement
by
itself
simply
does
not
violate
the
fourteenth
amendment
even
when
done
by
a
state
and
congress
developed
no
evidence
of
some
unconstitutional
conduct
on
the
part
of
states.
despite
this
lack
of
support,
congress
enacted
a
remedial
scheme
that
expose
states
to
expensive
liability
for
infringement
and
did
nothing
to
tailor
this
scheme
to
reach
at
any
conduct
that
might
have
violated
the
fourteenth
amendment.
the
statutes
apparent
and
more
basic
aims
were
to
provide
a
uniform
remedy
for
patent
infringement
and
place
the
states
on
the
same
footing
as
private
parties
under
that
regime.
these
are
proper
article
i
concerns,
but
not
fourteenth
amendment’s
concerns,
and
just
as
seminole
tribe
precludes
congress
from
enacting
such
legislation
under
article
i,
the
city
of
boerne
does
the
same
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
in
this
case.
justice
stevens
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which

ginsburg
and
breyer
