mr.
seth
p.
waxman
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
this
case,
congress
heard
testimony...
and
it's
reflected
in
one
hearing
and...
and
two...
two
reports,
a
house
committee
report
and
a
senate
committee
report...
that
in
recent
years
state
universities
and
other
instrumentalities
have,
to
an
unprecedented
extent,
become
active
in
commercial
technology
development;
that
as
a
consequence,
allegations
of
infringement
by
these
entities
have
risen
and
are
projected
to
increase
dramatically;
and
that
state
laws,
which
vary
widely,
are
in
many
instances
inadequate
to
prevent
or
remedy
infringement
by
a
state
and
thus
to
secure
due
process
of
law.
now--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--we
absolutely
do,
and
the
reason
is
that
the
nature...
and
i
think
this
may
be
something
that...
i...
i...
as
a
non
patent
lawyer,
i
wasn't
aware
of
until
i
got
involved
in
this
case.
the
intentional
infringement
is
the
means
by
which
our
system
tests
the
validity
of
a
patent,
that
is,
there
is
intentional
infringement,
and
intentional
conduct
and
willful
infringement
are
different
things.
but
the...
the
mine
run
of
infringement
cases
are
cases
where
someone
says,
i
know
you
have
a
patent,
i
don't
think
your
patent
is
valid.
i
am...
the
means
by
which
i
obtain
a
judicial
resolution
of
that
question
is
by
infringement.
that's
how
the
system
works.
now,
what
the
states
heard...
there
is
no
question,
i
submit,
that
the
remedy
congress
chose
here
does,
quote,
secure
due
process
within
the
meaning
of
section
5.
the
question
is
what--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--well,
i
think,
justice
rehnquist,
that
goes
to
the
question,
obviously,
of
what
is
due
process.
we're
not
here
arguing
that
an
act
of
infringement
constitutes
a
substantive
due
process
violation.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
the...
the...
ordinarily
the
deprivation
of
recognized
property,
and
i
will
later--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--well,
the...
the
patent
right
is
defined
by
congress
as
a
result
of
the
direction
in
the
constitution
that
congress
secure
the
exclusive
right
for
inventors,
and
that's
what
the
patent
law
provides.
it
gives
the
patent
owner,
for
a
limited
period
of
time,
a
right
to
exclude...
the
exclusive
use
of
this
device
and
when
somebody
infringes
that,
that
is,
by
definition,
that's
the
way
that
we
characterize
a
non
authorized
use
of
a
patented
device.
now,
we
will...
we
concede,
certainly
for
purposes
of
this
case,
that
the
due
process
violation
is
not
complete
in
the
absence
of
a
showing
that
there
is
not
an
effective
pre
or
post
deprivation
remedy.
ordinarily...
and
in
this
respect,
we
think
that
the
very
unique
nature
of
patents
says
a
lot
about
what
the
due
process
requires
by
way
of
remedy,
either
within
the
states
or
nationally.
the...
we're
dealing--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--he...
under
your
scenario
i
think
the...
any
court
would
say
no
because
there
has
been
a
de
minimis
deprivation
of
property.
i
mean,
i
don't
know
if
it
were--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--well,
the
question
then
would
be,
how
important
is
the
property
right
here,
that
is,
how
much
did
the
owner
lose,
and
did
the
state
provide
a
mechanism
for
remedying
that?
now,
ordinarily
the
deprivation
of
property
requires...
we
know
from
many
of
this
court's
opinions...
a
pre
deprivation
remedy
before
the
state
can
take
property
from
you.
that
is
not
available
in
these
cases,
and
it
is
one
of
the
many
respects
in
which
patents
are
a
particularly
unique
form
of
property.
another
is
that
patents
are
a
form
of
property
that
have
an
extremely
limited
life
span
of
value.
they're
granted
for
20
years,
but
as
a
practical
matter
and
as
congress
heard
in
the
hearings
i've
mentioned,
the...
the
galloping
pace
of
technology
makes
the
useful
life
of
these
inventions
very,
very
short.
and--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--i
think
it's
not
only
true
in
theory,
justice
o'connor,
but
if
the
court
reads
mckesson
and
reich
v.
collins
and
general
oil
v.
crane
the
way
i
read
them,
or
at
least
the
way
i
advocated
in
alden
v.
maine,
i
think
a
good
argument
can
be
made
that
if
congress
provided
no
remedy
at
all,
the
states
would
be
required
by
the
constitution
to
provide
an
adequate
post
deprivation
remedy.
but
the
question
in
this
case,
i
respectfully
submit,
is
whether
or
not
what
congress
did...
in
1992,
congress
heard
there
was
a
problem.
it
was
emerging.
it
was
unique.
it
was
getting
worse,
and
that
for
whatever
reasons...
one
of
them
may
be
that
congress
for
200
years
has...
has
made
patent
remedies
an
exclusive
federal
cause
of
action.
for
whatever
reasons,
the
available
procedures
in
states
were
very
often
inadequate
to
provide
due
process.
and
so,
congress
sought
to
deal
with
that
problem.
and
the
question
is
whether
the
method
they
chose
is,
quote,
appropriate
legislation
within
the
meaning
of
section
5.
we
submit
that
it
is
for
three
reasons.
first,
as
i
said,
there's
no
doubt,
based
on
the
record,
that
congress
could
have
reasonably
concluded
that
many
states
had
inadequate
procedures,
but
more
important,
in
choosing
a
means
to
prevent
due
process
violations,
which
is
the
purpose
of
section
5
legislation,
congress
could
properly
take
into
account
first
the
unique
and
fragile
nature
of
the
patent
right;
second,
the
benefits
for
what
over
200
years
the...
has
been
a
system
of
exclusively
federal
court
enforcement;
and
third...
and
i
think
perhaps
most
important...
the
threat
to
patent
owners
and
to
the
patent
system
that
altering
this
would
produce.
there's
no
doubt
that--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--that's...
that
is
exactly
what
i
mean.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
if...
if
you--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--if
you
will
look
in
the...
in
the...
the
house
hearing
and
the
house
report,
you
will
find
instances...
a
conclusion
by
the
house
report
that
states
have
frequently
infringed
patents
and
refused
to
provide
any
compensation
whatsoever,
and
if
you...
let
me
just
finish
my
answer
before
you
tell
me
why
i'm
wrong...
inadequate
again.
[laughter]
if...
if
you
look
at
the
briefs
and
the
appendices
of
the
very
helpful,
i
think,
and
instructive
amicus
briefs
that
have
been
filed
on
both
sides
of
these
cases...
of
this
case,
the
amicus
brief
of
the
states
filed
by
the
state
of
ohio
and
the
amicus
brief
of
the
railroad
association
filed
in
support
of
us,
it
outlines
what
state
procedures
do
and
don't
exist.
there
are
states
that
never
waive
their
sovereign
immunity
for
anything.
there
are
states
that
never
waive
sovereign
immunity
for
tort
claims
of
any
sort.
there
are
states
that...
there's
almost...
there's
almost
a
variance
of
50
different
systems.
now,
what
i'm
saying
is
that
congress
could
not
have
concluded
that
there's
no
way
to
fix
this
system
in
the
states,
but
congress
concluded,
taking
a
snapshot
at
it...
what
it
was
told
was
an
emerging
and
very
serious
problem
of
what
existed
at
the
time.
now,
there
is
no
doubt,
i
think
adverting
to
something
that
justice
o'connor
had...
had
asked
earlier,
congress
could
have
said,
okay,
we're
going
to
solve
this
by
a
remedy
like
the
tax
injunction
act,
which
is,
you
know,
go
into
the
states.
if
the
states
don't
provide
adequate
due
process,
then
you
have
a
right
in
federal
court.
but
the...
the
test
under
section
5
for
what
is
appropriate
legislation
is
not
a
least
restrictive
means
test
or
least
restrictive
alternative
test.
it's
the
opposite.
this
court
has
said
in
boerne
that
it
is
for
congress
to
determine
in
the
first
instance
whether
and
what
legislation
is
needed
to
secure
the
guarantees
of
the
fourteenth
amendment,
and
its
conclusions
are
entitled
to
much
deference.
it
could
and
legitimately
did
take
into
account
the
way
the
system,
our
national
system,
of
federal
court
enforcement
has
worked
and
what
it
has
done
to
further
the
constitutional
aims
reflected
in
the
patent
and
copyright
clause
in
deciding
how
to
remedy
this
next
problem.
if
it
was
required
to
choose
the
means
that
was
most
protective
of
the
states,
there
was
a
lesser
means
it
could
have
chosen,
but
we
submit
that--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--no.
that
has...
well,
congress...
let
it...
let
me
be
clear.
i
am
not
attempting
to
trespass
on
article
i
or
trade
on
article
i
for
purposes
of
determining
what
is
appropriate
legislation.
but
we
know
from
dozens
of
this
court's
opinions
that
what
process
is
due
depends
on
the
nature
of
the
right,
and
the
nature
of
this
right
happens
to
be
derived
from
article
i
and
the...
the
patent
and
copyright
clause
of
the
constitution.
and
because
appropriate
legislation
does
not
need
to
be
the
least
restrictive
alternative
legislation,
congress
can
appropriately
take
account
of
the
way
the
system
works,
what
the
constitution
envisioned
and
what
has
become
a...
a
system
of
expeditious
determination
of
rights.
and
let
me
just
mention
one
other
thing
before
my
time
is
up
about
the
unique
nature
of
this
right.
one
of
the
really
fascinating
things
about
patent
rights
is
how
asymmetrical
the
legal
protections
are.
a
patent
owner
is
very,
very
vulnerable
because,
due
to
the
application
of
rules
like
offensive
collateral
estoppel...
and
this
goes
to
another
point
that
justice
o'connor
was
raising...
a
patent
owner
only
has
to
lose
once
before
he
is
precluded
in
the
courts
of
another
state
by
principles
of
offensive
collateral
estoppel
from
trying
to
litigate
it
again,
whereas
the
opposite
is
not
true.
and
what
that
dictates,
in
terms
of
protecting
and
preserving
the
nature
of
this
paradigmatic
intellectual
property
right,
is
a
system
where
there
is...
where
there
are
remedies
that
are
well
known,
expeditious,
and
where
there
is
an
immediate,
essentially,
appeal
to
one
appellate
authority
that
will
finally
render
a
decision.
now,
you
can
say,
as
you...
as
you
did
before...
and
i
know
you're
about
to--
[laughter]
--that
when
congress...
when
congress...
you
know,
when
the
constitution
was
adopted
by
the
framers,
they
put
in
the
patent
and
copyright
clause,
but
they
didn't
require
that
lower
federal
courts
be...
be
created.
but
i
think
what
that
reflects
is
the
very
beginning
of
what
has
been
a
long
trend
of
what
congress
has
required...
has
thought
to
be
necessary
in
order
to
make
efficacious
the
system
that
the
constitution
plainly
wanted.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
i
think
it's...
i
think
it's--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--it
is
very
proper
for
you
to
look
at
so
long
as
you
understand
that
we
are
essentially
comparing
apples
versus
oranges,
which
is
that
the
substantive
right
that
is
created
by
congress
is
not
a
right
to
exclude
the
united
states.
it
is
a
right
to
exclude
the
states
and
other
persons.
and
that
is
the
reason
why
the
remedies
are
not
coterminous.
and
i
also
would
say
that
it
would
be...
it
would
be
inappropriate
for
the
court
to
exaggerate
the
differences
between
the
state...
between
the
federal
remedy
1498
and
the
remedies
in
the
patent
laws.
in
both
instances,
the
measure
of
compensation,
in
all
but
exceptional
cases,
is
sufficient
compensation
or
some
appropriate
terms.
in
the
federal
statute,
attorney's
fees
are,
as
a
general
matter,
required;
whereas,
with
respect
to
all
others,
they're
only
applicable
in
exceptional
cases.
and
treble
damages,
which
is
not
applicable
to
the
united
states...
may
i
finish
my
sentence?
