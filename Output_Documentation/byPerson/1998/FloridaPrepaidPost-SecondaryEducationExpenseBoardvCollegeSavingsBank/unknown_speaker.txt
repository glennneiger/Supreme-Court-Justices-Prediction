unknown
speaker
well,
mr.
glogau,
what
is
it
exactly
that
was
patented
here?
unknown
speaker
i
thought
that's
pretty
easy.
i
thought
you
just
add
10
percent
every
year.
isn't
that--
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
what
are
the
remedies
in
florida
for
patent
infringement?
unknown
speaker
what
are
the
state
remedies
in
florida
for
patent
infringement?
unknown
speaker
well,
let
me...
let
me
just
be
sure
i
have
an
answer
to
my
question.
my
question
is
what
is
the
remedy
in
florida
for
patent
infringement,
and
you're
saying
it's
an
inverse
condemnation
remedy?
unknown
speaker
that
you
have
to
prove
you've
taken
the
whole
patent.
unknown
speaker
well,
let
me
just
simplify.
in
the
whole
history
of
florida,
has
there
ever
been
a
state
judgment
granting
relief
for
patent
infringement?
unknown
speaker
how
many
times
has
florida
infringed
patents
as
far
as
we
know,
and
infringed
them
intentionally,
which
i
would
assume
would
have
to
be
a
condition
for
a
taking?
can
you
have
an
unintentional
taking?
unknown
speaker
is
that
right?
you
could
violate...
violate
the--
unknown
speaker
--takings
clause
by
a
negligent
act?
unknown
speaker
so,
how
many
times
to
your
knowledge
has
florida
intentionally
violated
somebody's
patent?
unknown
speaker
but
you're
not
suggesting--
unknown
speaker
--that
intent
is
an
element
of
patent
infringement.
you're
not
suggesting
that.
unknown
speaker
it's
an
element
of
the
takings
claim,
however.
it's
an
element
of
the
takings
claim.
which
means
that
the
florida
takings
remedy
would
not
be
coextensive
with
the
patent
infringement
remedy.
unknown
speaker
right,
but
neither...
neither
can
the...
the
use
of...
of
section
5
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
extend
to
unintentional
takings.
i
mean,
the
federal
remedy
is
no...
is
no
better
than
the
state
remedy
in
that
regard.
unknown
speaker
once
you
notify
the
alleged
infringer
that
the
infringer
is
infringing
on
your
patent,
then
one
can't...
and
the
infringer
continues,
one
can't
claim
that
the
action
is
unintentional
at
that
point.
unknown
speaker
whatever.
one
can't
say,
oh,
i
just
didn't
know
that
this
patent
was
out
there.
i
was
acting
unintentionally.
you're
acting
at
that
point
intentionally.
you
may
think
that
you're
not
in
violation
or
that
it's
a
question
that
the
court
will
set
out,
but
anyway,
you
are
acting
deliberately
with
the
knowledge
that
someone
has
said,
you're
violating
my
patent.
unknown
speaker
well,
you...
one
part
was
the
absence
of
deliberate
conduct.
just
discuss
that.
but
another
question
i
have
about
this
takings
remedy
which
you
say
is
what...
how
florida
would
response
to
the
due
process
issue,
i
was
not
aware
that
patents
were
subject
to
the
eminent
domain
power.
are
they?
unknown
speaker
i
thought
answer
then
is
that
you
can't
do
it,
state.
you
can't
stop
somebody
from
doing
this
if
you
don't
have
the
power
to
take.
unknown
speaker
you
said
the
state
remedy
would
be
compensation
for
the
state's
exercise
of
eminent
domain.
unknown
speaker
well,
you
said
it
would
be
a
takings.
the
state
can
take.
that's
the
premise
of...
i
thought
of
the
eminent
domain
power.
the
state
can
take,
but
it's
got
to
pay
for
it.
unknown
speaker
and
here
the
question
is,
can
the
state
take?
is
the
patent,
which
is
governed
by
federal
law...
it's
a
property,
the
bounds
of
which
are
determined
by
federal
law.
is
there
any
authority
at
all
for
a
state
to
take
that?
unknown
speaker
i
don't
understand
the
tenth
amendment
because
i
thought
right
in
the
constitution
there
was
the
patent
clause,
that
that
was
going
to
be
given
over
to
congress
would
not
reserved...
we
don't
get
into
the
reserved
powers
to
the
state
when
we're
dealing
with
patents,
do
we?
unknown
speaker
so,
are
you
changing
the
answer
now
and
saying
that,
yes,
a
state
can
take
a
patent?
unknown
speaker
suppose
some
state
says,
gee,
we
really
like
this
patent,
so
we
want
to
have
it.
so,
we'll
condemn
it
and
we'll
pay
for
it.
unknown
speaker
mr.
glogau,
what
do
you...
what
do
you
say
to
this
argument?
i
mean,
your...
as
i
understand
it,
your...
your
principal
point
is
or
a
principal
point
is
that
assuming
there's
property
here,
that's
not
enough
to...
to
ground
an
exercise
of
fourteenth
amendment,
section
5
jurisdiction.
there's
got
to
be
some
showing
that
in
the
absence
of
this
legislation,
there
will
be
an
infringement
on
that
property
without
due
process
of
law,
and
you're
saying
there's
got
to
be,
in
effect,
a
due
process
component
undergirding
the
federal
statute.
unknown
speaker
am
i
right?
that's
your
argument.
unknown
speaker
all
right.
what...
what
do
you
say
to
the
argument
that
the
very
nature
of
a
patent
requires
a
uniform
remedy,
that
the
very...
the
very
consignment,
if
you
will,
of
a...
of
a
federal
patentee
to
remedies
in
florida
for
a
state
of
florida
violation,
montana
for
a
montana
violation,
california
for
a
california
violation
is
itself,
in
effect,
a...
a
denial
of
the
right
that
comes
with
the
very
concept
of
a
federal
patent,
given
the
emphasis
that
was...
was
obviously
placed
on...
exclusive
emphasis
on
federal
law
in
the
constitution?
and
therefore,
simply
to
consign
patent
holders
to
the
seriatim
remedies
of
states,
which
may
differ,
which
certainly
come
through
a
different
court
system...
they
won't
come
through
ca
fed....
is...
is
tantamount
to
a
denial
to
due
process,
and
therefore,
the...
the
demand
for
uniformity
is
sufficient
to
satisfy
the
due
process
component
of
section
5.
what's
your
response
to
that
argument?
unknown
speaker
well,
but
the
federal
circuit
is
no
longer
going
to
get
a
crack
at
this...
at
the
cases
that
come
out
of
the
state
courts.
unknown
speaker
but
i
suppose
this
court
would.
unknown
speaker
i...
i
assume
that
we
sit
to
require
uniform
interpretation
of
federal
law,
do
we
not?
unknown
speaker
and
is
it
also--
--mr.
glogau--
--is
it
also
not
the
case
that
congress
apparently
thought
that
that
was
an
insufficient
means
to
the
uniformity
that
it
was
constitutionally
capable
of
mandating,
and...
and
it
expressed
this
sense
of
insufficiency
by
creating
the...
the
present
appellate
scheme
by
which
everything
goes
through
the
federal
circuit?
unknown
speaker
isn't
that
also
true?
unknown
speaker
well,
it
has
been
created...
it
has
been
created
now,
and
doesn't
it
express
that
judgment
of
congress?
unknown
speaker
well,
isn't
that
the
judgment
of
congress?
unknown
speaker
well,
it's
a
legislative
preference
i
presume
in...
in
aid
of
the...
the
power
given
to
the
national
government
under
the
patent
clause.
unknown
speaker
and...
and
it
does
express
that
preference,
doesn't
it?
unknown
speaker
doesn't
it?
unknown
speaker
the
question
is
not
whether
it
is
an
absolute
necessity,
and
i
think
it's...
i
think
you...
you
concede
this
in
your
argument.
the
question
is
whether
it
is
a
reasonable
means
to
the
accomplishment
or
to
the
avoidance,
perhaps
i
should
say,
of
a
due
process
problem.
and
i
assume
the...
the
judgment
of
the
congress
in
creating
the
present
appellate
scheme
was
that
it
was
a
means,
a
reasonable
means,
to
provide
the
uniformity
that
was
thought
desirable
under
the
patent
clause.
and
if
that
judgment
is
a
sound
one,
then
i
suppose
it
is
an
equally
sound
judgment
that
that
is
a
reasonable
means
to
avoid
the
due
process
problem
of,
in
effect,
seriatim
standards
which
are
difficult
for
this
court
to
resolve.
unknown
speaker
isn't
that
a
fair
application
of
section
5?
unknown
speaker
well,
we've
never
had
a...
a
case
under
the
patent
clause
in
which
the
very
premise
of
the
exercise
of
any
congressional
power
is
that
there
should
be,
in
effect,
an
exclusive
federal
scheme
for
the
sake
of
uniformity.
unknown
speaker
well,
now,
you...
you
don't
concede
that
the...
that
the
implication
of
the
patent
clause
is
that
you
or
that
anyone
could
reasonably
find,
including
congress,
that
the
implication
of
the
patent
clause
is
that
you
must
have
a
uniform
federal
remedy
in
federal
courts
because
the
very
congress
that
enacted
the...
the
very
convention
that...
that
put
in
the...
the
patent
clause
also
did
not
put
in
a
provision
for
federal
courts.
unknown
speaker
it
was
envisioned
in
1789
that
you
could...
you
could
have
a
patent
law
without
having
federal
courts
passing
upon
the
federal
patent
law,
except
at
the
supreme
court
stage.
unknown
speaker
and
the
question
i
suppose
is
whether
that
judgment
in
1789
is
now
a
sound
judgment
and
whether
congress
has
the
power
to
revise
it
for
the
sake
of
uniformity.
is
it
your
position
that
congress
does
not
have
the
power
to
make
that
judgment,
that
congress
does
not
have
the
power
to
make
the
judgment
that
a
uniform
system,
including
a
uniform
judicial
scheme
for
providing
uniformity
in
patent
law...
that
is
beyond
the
power
of
congress?
is
that
your
position?
unknown
speaker
so,
the
answer
is
when
the
states
are
involved,
congress
does
not
have
the
power
by
any
means,
including
section
5,
to
prescribe
a
scheme
for
uniformity
in
the
interpretation
and
litigation
of
patent
law.
unknown
speaker
no,
but
suppose...
suppose--
unknown
speaker
--mr.
glogau,
this
act
was
passed
in
1992,
wasn't
it?
unknown
speaker
do
you
know
how
many
suits
have
been
brought
against
states
under
it
for
patent
infringement?
unknown
speaker
in
fact,
the
uniformity
premise
is...
is
not
entirely
accurate,
is
it,
because
what
congress
has
done
is
subjected
the
states
to
triple
damages,
to
attorney's
fees,
and
it
doesn't
even
subject
the
federal
government
to
that.
the
federal
government
need
pay
only
a
reasonable
royalty.
unknown
speaker
so,
congress
bracketed
the
states
as
a
matter
of
substantive
law?
--his
answer.
i'm
sorry.
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
if
it
would
be
adequate
in
your
view
of
the
eleventh
amendment
then
if
congress
treated
the
states
the
same
way
as
it
treated
the
united
states?
in
other
words,
whatever
the
section
was,
14--
unknown
speaker
--if
that...
if
they
said,
states,
you're
liable,
but
just
the
way
the
united
states
is,
no
more,
no
less.
unknown
speaker
well,
as
far
as
the
eleventh
amendment
is
concerned--
unknown
speaker
--suppose
that...
that
what
i
read
is
true,
that...
that
the
future
lies
in
intellectual
property,
the
economy's
future.
a
lot
of
that
is
connected
with
learning.
a
lot
of
learning
involves
schools,
and
a
lot
of
schools
are
state
entities.
now,
are
you
saying
that
if
we
go
to
china
or
all
these
other
countries
and
tell
them,
you
know,
you
need
a
speedy,
effective
patent,
copyright,
trademark,
and
other
intellectual
property
remedy.
and
they
say,
do
you
have
one
in
the
united
states?
and
congress
is
required
by
the
constitution
to
answer
that
question
no.
is...
is
that...
i
mean,
is
that
your
view
of
the
constitution?
unknown
speaker
i
mean,
it
sounds
as
if
it
is,
and
if
that's
what
it
is,
that's
what
it
is.
but
obviously,
i'd
like
you
to
say
something
to
reassure
me
that
what
i've
just
said
isn't
going
to
happen.
unknown
speaker
no,
no,
no.
they
won't.
we
all
know
there
are
a
lot
of
difficult
questions
in
patent
and
copyright
law.
unknown
speaker
and
we
also
know
that
people
need
security
that
their
intellectual
property
won't
be
infringed.
so,
i'd
say
they're
the
same
as
anybody
else.
unknown
speaker
this
is
helpful.
this
is
helpful
because
my
thought
had
been
and
the
underlying
premise
had
been
that
if
you
win
your
case,
the
same
is
true
for
copyright,
the
same
is
true
for
trademark,
and
the
same
is
true
for
any
new
form
of
intellectual
property
devised
to
protect
computer
programs,
protect
communications,
protect
any
of
these
inventions
that
are
now
fueling
the
economy.
now,
if
you
can
tell
me
that
patents
are
different,
you
have
helped
me.
but
can
you?
unknown
speaker
mr.
glogau,
is
it...
is
it
unusual
that
we
are...
that
the
federal
government
is
inconvenienced
in
its
dealing
with
foreign
nations
because
of
our
federal
system?
unknown
speaker
is...
is
that
at
all
unusual?
some...
some
other
countries
will
not
extradite
people
because
some
of
our
states
have
the
death
penalty.
unknown
speaker
do
we
have
the
ability
to
eliminate
the
death
penalty,
therefore,
because
it
inconveniences
our
foreign
relations?
unknown
speaker
yes,
that
is
a
separate
issue,
all
right.
[laughter]
may
i
just
ask
this...
ask
this
question?
you
made
quite
a
point
of
the
fact
that
most
patent
infringements
are
by
private
parties
in...
in
the
economy
and
the
states
are
not
big
players
in
patent
infringement.
but
how
do
we
know
that
isn't
changing
and
changing
very
rapidly?
and
this
is
a
question
i
wanted
to
ask
you.
one
of
the
amicus
briefs
says
that
the
state
of
florida
has
some
200
patents
now.
i
assume
that's
a
fairly
recent
development,
or
maybe
you'll
tell
me
they've
been
on
the
books
since
florida
became
a
state.
my
hunch
is
that
florida,
like
states
all
over
the
country,
are
engaging
in
more
and
more
intellectual
activity
that
leads
to
patent
situations
where
they
apply
for
patents
or
they
possibly
engage
in
activities
that
might
infringe
patents.
what
is
your
view
on
whether
there
is
change
going
on
in
this
area?
unknown
speaker
no,
of
course
not.
but
the
more
that
any
entity,
a
private
business
or
a
state
or...
gets
involved
in
this
kind
of
development
where
there
are
arguments
about
invention
infringement
and
so
forth,
they're
bound
to
be
also
questions
of
infringement
arising
not
necessarily
deliberately
but
just
that
they're
an
active
participant
in
the
intellectual
marketplace
where
all
these
problems
arise.
and
that
seems
to
me
quite...
quite
wrong
to
assume
that
the
absence
of
a
lot
of
litigation
in
the
past
means
that
there's
just
no
problem
out
there
because
your
view
basically
would
say
that
states...
in
fact,
they
would
motivate
states
to
get
involved
in
all
sorts
of
activity
because
they
will
always
have
one
free
shot.
until
somebody
gets
an
injunction
against
infringement,
they
can
infringe
and
not
have
any
worry
about
damage
liability.
unknown
speaker
are
there
also
state
tort
remedies?
the
florida
supreme
court
suggested
there
may
be.
unknown
speaker
let
me
ask
you
this.
if
it
should
turn
out
in
the
future
that
states
are
shown
to
be
violating
intellectual
property
rights
of
others
and
that
states
are
not
providing
adequate
state
remedies
for
such
violations,
would
congress
then
have
power
to
enact
section
5
legislation
to
remedy
that
lack?
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
just
in...
whatever...
a
taking,
whatever
the
label
is
in
the
state
court,
all
of
the
law
that
would
be
applied
to
determine
whether
there
was
infringement,
that
would
all
be
federal.
right?
unknown
speaker
thank
you,
mr.
glogau.
mr.
culligan,
we'll
hear
from
you.
unknown
speaker
don't
you
think
that
city
of
boerne
modified
some
of
the
language
in
morgan?
unknown
speaker
excuse
me.
they
have
no
power
to
do
that.
i
mean,
that
objective...
you
say
there
can
be
no
doubt
about
it,
but
there
is
doubt
about
it.
that's...
that's
an
article
i
objective
that
you're
now
reciting,
and
there
is
indeed,
not
only
doubt.
congress
can't
do
that.
it
cannot
use
that
article
i
objective
as
a
means
of
eliminating
sovereign
immunity.
unknown
speaker
let's
look
at
the
fourteenth
amendment
objective.
unknown
speaker
okay.
now,
what
was
the
problem
with
the
states
and
the...
in...
in
unconstitutional
takings
of
patent
rights?
unknown
speaker
how
many?
as
i...
as
i
recollect,
there
were...
congress
found
that
between--
unknown
speaker
--1887
and
1990
there
were
eight.
unknown
speaker
this
is
a
big
problem.
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
why?
because
the
states
are...
they're
going
to
want
to
take
people's
patent
rights?
unknown
speaker
did
they
say
that
intentional
violation
by
the
states
was
going
to
increase?
unknown
speaker
to
be
sure,
but
did
they
really
think
that
the
states
were
intentionally
going
to
be
violating
people's
patents
more
and
more?
because
that's
the
only
thing
that's
relevant.
unknown
speaker
because
that's
the
only
fourteenth
amendment
violation,
an
intentional
violation
of
somebody's
patent.
and
did
they
really
think
that
was
going
to
be
very
frequent?
unknown
speaker
may
lead?
is
that...
is
that
enough
to...
to
invoke
section
5
of
the
fourteenth
amendment?
unknown
speaker
are
the
two
of
you
debating
what's
in
the
legislative
history?
unknown
speaker
we're
not
using
the
legislative
history
to
determine
the
meaning
of
the
statute,
are
we,
as
justice
stevens
often
does?
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
mr.
culligan,
do
you
think
that
congress'
authority
here
depends
in
any
way
on
the
fact
that
congress
under
its
article
i
patent
power
granted
the
patent
in
the
first
place,
or
does
that
have
nothing
to
do
with
it?
unknown
speaker
so,
if
congress
had
decided
that
states
are
really
not
giving
people
a
square
deal
on
inverse
condemnation
cases,
or
the
state
may
occupy
something
without
having
condemned
it
and
they
figure
maybe
the
damages
aren't
enough,
congress
could
have
done
that
too.
unknown
speaker
if
you
say...
if
you
take
that
position,
then
you
don't
have
to
take
the
broad
position
that
anything
congress
likes,
it
can
make
a
federal
property
right
and,
therefore,
enforce
it
under
section
5.
i
thought
your
argument
was
homed
in
on
the
special
nature
of
a
patent.
unknown
speaker
there
is
no
argument,
i
guess,
here
that
the
power
arises
under
the
patent
clause.
unknown
speaker
no,
no.
i
understand
that.
i
just
wondered...
no,
but
you
haven't
made
this
argument,
so
i
assume
it's
not...
there's
a
reason
that
just...
the
patent
clause
would
give
congress
the
power
to
create
a
system
of
effective
remedies
against
all
violators,
including
the
state.
but
that's
not
an
argument
you're
making--
unknown
speaker
--so
there
probably--
unknown
speaker
--well,
they
may
not
have
the
right
to
do
it,
but
it's
a
separate
question
of
whether
their
violation
of
that
right
is
a
constitutional
violation.
and
as
i
understand
that
state's
position,
it
is
that
it
is
only
a
constitutional
violation
where
there
is
not
only
a
deprivation,
but
also
a
failure
to
provide
adequate
compensation
because
that's
the
way
the
fourteenth
amendment
reads.
a
taking
is
not
unconstitutional.
it's
only
a
taking
where
you
fail
to
provide
adequate
compensation.
and
it
seems
to
me
a
reasonable
position.
unknown
speaker
are
you
sure
of
that,
mr.
culligan?
supposing
florida
had
a
big
botanical
enterprise,
as
it
might
have,
of
tropical
plants,
and
to...
to
work
with
that
or
to...
they
felt
it
was
necessary
to
condemn
a
botanical
patent
that
had
issued
by
the
government.
are
you
saying
that
a
state
could
not
condemn
that
sort
of
property?
unknown
speaker
and
what's...
what's
the
authority
for
that?
unknown
speaker
well,
i'm
sure
if
congress
said,
when
it
issued
a
patent,
that
no
state
shall
have
the
right
to
condemn
it,
it
could
do
that
under
article
i,
but
congress
hasn't
done
that.
unknown
speaker
why
is
this
different
from
federal
land
patents?
i
mean,
the
federal
government
issued...
has
issued
many
patents
for
land
to
private
citizens.
once
they
have
that
land,
pursuant
to
a
federal
patent,
is
that
land
not
condemnable?
unknown
speaker
it's
the
one
involved
in
your
case.
unknown
speaker
it's
not
only
that--
unknown
speaker
--but
if
one
state
could
condemn
a
patent,
all
50
states
could,
but
all
50
states
can't
condemn
a
piece
of
land.
unknown
speaker
well,
that
may
well
be
that
they
cannot
take
away
without
sort
of
distorting
the
patent
right,
the
right
to
exclude
others,
but
they
can
take
away
the
exclusivity
insofar
as
it
applies
to
them.
and
that
wouldn't
create
any...
any
terrible
inconvenience.
each
state
might
condemn
the
same
botanical
patent
insofar
as
use
by
that
state
is
concerned.
unknown
speaker
no,
no,
no,
no.
that's
not
what
the
state
says.
the
state
simply
says,
we're
taking...
it's
important
for
us
to
use
this...
this
botanical
right.
we
need
it.
you
won't
give
it
to
us.
we're
going
to...
we're
going
to
assert
the
right
to
use
it
without
your
permission.
we're
condemning
that
aspect,
that...
that
stick
in
your
bundle
of
patent
rights.
why
couldn't
every
state
do
that?
unknown
speaker
there
would
be
50
states
who
would
have
a
right
to
use
it
without
paying
the
patent
owner.
anybody
else
who
wanted
to
use
it
would
have
to
pay
the
patent
owner.
and
as
to
those
50
states
who
have
claimed
the
right
to
use
it
without
his
consent,
they'd
have
to
pay
him.
unknown
speaker
--for
zero?
i
mean,
there...
there
would
be
a
condemnation
action
in
the
state,
and...
and
the
patent
owner
would
get
a
reasonable
return.
unknown
speaker
well,
let's
assume
all
the
50
states
did
this
and
you
had
suits
in
federal
court.
couldn't
you...
wouldn't
you
get
different
monetary
awards
in
each
of
the
50
states?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
but
the
law
would
always
be
uniformly
interpreted
because--
unknown
speaker
--we
would
review
it
here.
unknown
speaker
and
that
would
be
the
same
thing
in
the
state
courts.
unknown
speaker
don't
you
think
this
court
would
have
the
power
of
review
and
to
issue
rulings
on
what
the
law
is
so
that
it
would
be
uniform?
unknown
speaker
it's
remarkable
that
the
framers
did
not
envision
this
as
a
problem
when
they
adopted
the...
the
patent
clause
because
they
adopted
a
patent
clause
without
adopting
a
provision
for
federal...
for
federal
courts.
unknown
speaker
it's
perfectly
optional
whether
there
would
be
federal
courts
or
not.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
but
the
constitution
hasn't.
unknown
speaker
mr.
waxman,
we'll
hear
from
you.
unknown
speaker
mr.
waxman,
these
infringements
that
congress
was
concerned
about,
do
we
have
any
reason
to
think
that
they
were
intentional
infringements?
unknown
speaker
general
waxman,
what
was
the
theory
on
which
congress
thought
that
the
states
pleading
sovereign
immunity
to
a
patent
infringement
denied
the
patent
owner
due
process?
unknown
speaker
well,
then
what
are
you...
what
are
you
arguing?
unknown
speaker
but
you
say
deprivation,
but
a...
you're
saying
a
plea
of
sovereign
immunity
on
the
part
of
the
state
is
the
same
thing
as
the
state
actually
reaching
out
and
taking
the
whole
patent?
unknown
speaker
what
if...
what
if,
say,
a
state
police
officer
at
some
emergency
scene...
he
finds
himself
without
a
car,
so
he
simply
commandeers
the
car
of
a
private
owner
and
says,
i've
got
to
take
this
for
an
hour
and
i'll
give
it
back
to
you?
now,
has
he
deprived
that
person
of
due
process?
unknown
speaker
what
if
he
takes...
takes
it
for
3
days?
unknown
speaker
well,
general
waxman,
certainly
in
theory
a
state
could
provide
adequate
remedies
for
violation
and
could,
indeed,
apply
correctly
federal
patent
law
in
doing
so,
could
they
not?
unknown
speaker
could
i
come
back
to
your
first
point
before
you
get
too
far
into
the...
because
i
didn't
agree
with
you.
you
said
there's
no
doubt
that
congress
could
reasonably
find...
could
reasonably
have
found
that
the
states
did
not
provide
adequate
remedies.
now,
i
would
agree
with
you
if
what
you
mean
by
adequate
is
adequate
for
purposes
of
article
i,
that
is,
remedies
that
would
not
achieve
the...
the
fullest,
most
uniform,
most
facile
protection
of
the
patent
right
that
they
would
like
to
achieve
under
article
i.
but
i
think
what
you
have
to
mean
is
adequate
for
purposes
of
the
takings
clause,
and
i--
unknown
speaker
--i
don't
know
what...
what--
unknown
speaker
--evidence
there
is
for
that.
unknown
speaker
you're
dragging
article
i
back
in
again.
i
don't
know
that
it's...
that
it's
proper
in
deciding
whether
congress
was
within
the
range
of
relative...
you
know,
of
appropriate
means
to
bring
in
the
factors
you
say,
that
this
is
a
patent
right
and
the
distinctive
qualities
and
all
of
that.
that's
all
article
i--
unknown
speaker
--in
determining
the
proportionality
under
the
boerne
test
of
the
article
v
legislation,
should
we
refer
properly
to
the
rules
for
when
the
united
states
itself
violates
a
patent,
i.e.,
no
punitive
damages,
royalties
only,
not
even
compensatory
damages?
unknown
speaker
is
that
proper
for
us
to
look
at
in
determining
the
proportionality
of
the
congressional
response?
unknown
speaker
yes.
no.
your
time
has
expired.
mr.
glogau,
you
have
3
minutes
remaining.
unknown
speaker
mr.
glogau,
with
respect
to
the
remedy,
we
heard
a
case,
the
alden
case
from
maine,
and
there
one
answer
was
the
united
states
could
always
sue
because
there
is
no
eleventh
amendment
immunity
in
that
case.
but
i
take
it
in
the
patent
picture,
there
isn't
that
possibility
for
enforcement,
is
there?
unknown
speaker
well,
there
is...
there's
an
administrative
set
up
in
the
secretary
of
labor
to
enforce
the
fair
labor
standards
act.
unknown
speaker
so,
there's...
but
there's
nothing
like
that,
as
far
as
i
know,
for...
the
federal
government
has
no
agency
that
brings
suits
to
enforce
private
patents.
unknown
speaker
why
is
that
so?
it's
very
basic,
but--
unknown
speaker
the
honorable
court
is
now
adjourned
until
tomorrow
at
ten
o'clock.
