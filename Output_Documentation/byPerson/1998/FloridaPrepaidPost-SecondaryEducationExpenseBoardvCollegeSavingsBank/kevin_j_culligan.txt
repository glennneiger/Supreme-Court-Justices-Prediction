mr.
kevin
j.
culligan
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
constitutionality
of
congress'
enactment
of
the
patent
remedy
act
should
be
measured
by
the
yardstick
the
court
employed
in
katzenbach
against
morgan
where
the
court
looked
to
the
classic
formulation
of
the
scope
of
congress'
authority,
articulated
by
chief
justice
marshall
in
mcculloch
against
maryland.
if
the
end
is
legitimate,
if
it's
within
the
scope
of
the
constitution,
then
all
means
that
are
appropriate
and
that
are
plainly
adapted
to
that
end
that
are
not
prohibited
but
consistent
with
the
letter
and
the
spirit
of
the
constitution
are
constitutional.
in
morgan,
the
court
stated
that
section
5
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
is
correctly
viewed
as
a
positive
grant
of
legislative
power
that
authorizes
congress
to
exercise
its
discretion
in
determining
whether
and
what
legislation
is
needed
to
secure
the
guarantees
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
mr.
kevin
j.
culligan
yes.
in...
in
its
exposition
of
the
katzenbach/morgan
standard,
the
court
explained
that
the
legislation
that's
the
subject
of
the
constitutional
challenge
must
not
create
or
alter
any
rights
and
it...
it
must
be
proportional
to
the
legitimate
constitutional
end
that
it
is
designed
to
prevent.
the
standard
prescribed
in
morgan
was
recently
echoed
by
the
court
in
boerne
where
the
court
observed
that
it's
for
congress
in
the
first
instance
to
determine
whether
and
what
legislation
is
needed
and
that
its
conclusions
are
entitled
to
much
deference.
there
should
be
no
question
here
about
the
legitimacy
or
the...
of
the
end
or
the
objective
that
underlies
the
enactment
of
the
patent
remedy
act.
congress
enacted
the
patent
remedy
act
in
1992
to
prevent
and
deter
the
states
from
depriving
patent
owners
of
the
sum
total
of
the
property
right
that's
secured
by
a
patent,
the
right
to
exclude
all
others,
including
the
states,
and
to
provide
a
uniform
set
of
procedures
and
remedies--
mr.
kevin
j.
culligan
--that's
correct,
justice
scalia,
but
what
congress
did
here
was
to
take
a
look
at
the...
at
a
problem.
the
ways--
mr.
kevin
j.
culligan
--that's
correct.
it's
a...
it's
a--
mr.
kevin
j.
culligan
--congress
considered
a
number
of
reported
cases
that
involved
state
patent...
state
sponsored
patent--
mr.
kevin
j.
culligan
--eight
i
believe.
mr.
kevin
j.
culligan
that's...
that's
correct.
mr.
kevin
j.
culligan
they
also
considered
testimony,
your
honor,
that
infringement
by
the
states
is
expected
to
increase
as
the
states...
the
states
rush
to
commercialize--
mr.
kevin
j.
culligan
--they're--
mr.
kevin
j.
culligan
--as...
well,
they
said
that
the
states
are
going
to
become
more
involved
in...
in
patents
as
they--
mr.
kevin
j.
culligan
--well--
mr.
kevin
j.
culligan
--in
fact...
well,
i
don't
know
about
the
frequency,
your
honor,
but
they
considered
that
very
problem.
they
heard
testimony
that
if
the
states
are
granted
eleventh
amendment
immunity,
then
they
will...
it
will
breed
a
growing
disrespect
for
patent
rights
and
may
lead
to
situations
where
the
states
intentionally
disregard
the
patent
rights
of
others.
mr.
kevin
j.
culligan
in
the
context
of
this
case,
your
honor,
there's...
there
is
certainly
a
basis
on
which
the
congress
could
have
concluded
that
the
due
process
rights
of
patent
owners--
mr.
kevin
j.
culligan
--in
some
measure,
your
honor.
and
of
course...
and
of
course,
this
court
held
in
boerne
that
the
constitutionality
of
the
act
should
not
be...
be
measured
by
the...
the
bounds
of
the
legislative
history.
mr.
kevin
j.
culligan
no,
your
honor.
what
we're
looking
for
is
a
constitutional
predicate
for
congress'
enactment
of...
of
the
patent
remedy
act.
and--
mr.
kevin
j.
culligan
--i
believe
that
congress
has
authority
under
section
5
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
to
protect
property
that's
deprived
without
due
process
regardless
of
the
origin
or
the
source
of
the
property.
the
fact
it
is
federally
created
property
here
adds
certain
dimensions
to
this
case,
but
it's
not
essential.
mr.
kevin
j.
culligan
yes,
i
believe
that's
within
their
power
under
section
5
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
patents
are
very
unique
and
a
special
kind
of
property.
they...
in
an
attempt
to
carry
out--
mr.
kevin
j.
culligan
--i
believe
that
this
is
not
a
case
at
the
fringe.
this
court
has
recognized,
in
decisions
extending
back
over
100
years,
that
patents
are
property,
that
takings
by
the
united
states
government
constitute
a
constitutionally
cognizable
deprivation.
so,
i
don't
know
what
the
limits
of...
of
congress's
power
to
create
property
are.
i
do
know
that
in
this
case,
with
respect
to
patents,
i
know
with
respect
to
copyrights,
that
congress
has
the
power
to
create
that
property,
and
under
section
5
of
the
fourteenth
amendment,
to
protect
them
by
abrogating
the
sovereign
immunity
of
the
states
when
the
states...
when
there's
a
significant
likelihood
that
the
states
will
deprive
persons
of
that
property
without
due
process
of
law.
mr.
kevin
j.
culligan
the
power
that
arises
under
the
patent
clause
is...
grants
congress
authority
to
create
a
patent
system
that,
in
exchange
for
the
disclosure
of
the
inventive
contribution,
the
inventor
gets
a
limited
right--
mr.
kevin
j.
culligan
--no,
i
have
not...
i
have
not
made
that
argument.
mr.
kevin
j.
culligan
but
the...
the
very
special
nature
of
the
patents
gives...
gives
rise
to
an
analogous
argument,
and
that
is
the
state's
arguments
are
predicated
on
the
notion
that
they
have
the
power
and
the
right
to
deprive
persons
of
their
patent
property.
and
i
don't
understand
where
the
source
of
that
power
comes
from,
and
i
know
that
they
don't
have
the
right
because
the
patent
grants
to
the
patent
owner
the
right
to
exclude
all
others,
including
the
states.
the
question
of
a
remedy
that
may
be
available
in
the
federal
court
is
another
question
that
we
have
to
address
under
section
5
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
mr.
kevin
j.
culligan
two
responses
to
that,
justice
scalia.
first
of
all,
when
a
state
exercises
its
power
of
eminent
domain
over
land,
it
has
the
right
to
condemn
the
property
so
long
as
it
provides
just
compensation
in
accordance
with
the
demands
of
the
fifth
amendment,
incorporated
through
the
fourteenth.
but
the
state
has
no
sovereign
power
over...
over
a
patent
and
no
right
to
take
it.
the
states
are
excluded
by
the
patent--
mr.
kevin
j.
culligan
--your
honor,
as...
as
i
understand
the
nature
of
the
patent
right,
the
answer
is
no.
mr.
kevin
j.
culligan
the
supremacy
clause.
mr.
kevin
j.
culligan
but
the
states
have
always
appreciated
that
they
are
bound
not
to
deprive
persons
of...
of
their...
their
sole
right
to
exclude.
the
only
question
is
whether
there's
a
remedy
available
for
it
in
the
federal
court.
mr.
kevin
j.
culligan
in...
in
the
context
of
land,
i
believe
the
answer
is
yes,
justice
scalia.
but
here
we're
talking
about
a
very
unique
patent
property
right,
and
if
the
only
right--
mr.
kevin
j.
culligan
--that's
correct.
[laughter]
mr.
kevin
j.
culligan
and
ours...
and
ours
is
a
very--
mr.
kevin
j.
culligan
--this
court
held
in
1933
in...
in
the
dubilier
condenser
corporation
case
that,
quote,
the
only
value
that
a
patent
has
is
the
right
it
extends
to
the
patentee
to
exclude
all
others
from
making,
using,
or
selling
the
invention
for
a
certain
period
of
years.
a
patent
that
is
dedicated
to
the
public
is
virtually
the
same
as
the
patent
that
has
expired.
if
each
of
the
50
states
has
the
right
to
condemn
and
take
and
dedicate
to
their
respective
publics
the
patent...
the
exclusivity
that's
guaranteed
the
patent
owner,
there
is
no
more
patent
right.
that
patent...
that
patent
has
been
taken,
vitiated,
and...
and
destroyed.
mr.
kevin
j.
culligan
if
one
state
condemns
a
patent
right,
it
is
the
private
patent
owner
of
the
right
to
exclusively
license
to
someone
else.
mr.
kevin
j.
culligan
if
they
did,
your
honor,
it's...
we're
back
to
dubilier.
the
patent
would
be
dedicated
to
the
public,
and
it's
no
patent
at
all.
the
only
thing
that
you
would
have
left
is
the
right
to
license
to
someone
else--
mr.
kevin
j.
culligan
--the
state's
ability
to
use
the...
the
patent
at
what
is
essentially
way
below
market
rate,
that
is,
zero,
for
no
compensation,
would
greatly
diminish
the
ability
of
someone
to
license...
license
the
patent--
mr.
kevin
j.
culligan
--this
court
in...
in
bonito
boats
unanimously
stated
that
one
of
the
fundamental
purposes
behind
the
patent
clause
is
to
promote
national
uniformity
in
the
realm
of
intellectual
property.
since
1800,
congress
has
lodged
exclusive
jurisdiction
of
actions
arising
under
the
patent
laws
in
the
federal
courts.
this
allowed
for
the
development
of
the
uniform
body
of
law
to
resolve
the
constant
tension
that
we're
talking
about
here
between
private
rights
and
public
access.
mr.
kevin
j.
culligan
in
the
federal
courts,
your
honor?
mr.
kevin
j.
culligan
it's...
that's
conceivable,
but
of
course--
mr.
kevin
j.
culligan
--that...
that--
mr.
kevin
j.
culligan
--that's
correct.
mr.
kevin
j.
culligan
no,
your
honor,
because
in
the
state
courts,
they
would
not
be
bound
by
the
decisions
of
the
federal
circuit.
each
state
would
be
free
to
decide
what
remedies
were
appropriate,
what
process
was
due,
what
factors
should
be
considered
in
determining
the
compensation.
they
could
also
apply
differing
standards
of...
of
patent
validity
to
determine
whether
there
was
any
property
to
take.
mr.
kevin
j.
culligan
yes,
your
honor,
and
what
we
would...
what
we
would
see
is...
is
50
to
100
years
of
litigation
with
the
same...
with
questions
coming
back
to
this
court
time
after
time
from
the
50
states.
this
court
has
held
and
recognized
repeatedly
that
it's
for
congress
in
the
first
instance
to
decide
what
remedies
are
appropriate
to
protect
property
from
due
process
violations.
mr.
kevin
j.
culligan
that--
mr.
kevin
j.
culligan
--may
i
respond
to
the
question?
mr.
kevin
j.
culligan
circumstances
have
changed,
justice
scalia.
this
court
recognized
that
in
bonito
boats.
mr.
kevin
j.
culligan
thank
you.
[laughter]
