justice
john
paul
stevens
aticle
i
of
the
constitution
provides
that
congress
shall
have
power
to
promote
the
progress
of
science
and
useful
arts
by
securing
for
limited
times
to
authors
and
inventors
the
exclusive
right
to
their
respective
writings
and
discoveries.
pursuant
to
that
expressed
allegation
of
power,
congress
has
authorized
the
issuance
of
patents
and
litigation
to
protect
patents
and
patentees
that
may
only
be
brought
in
a
federal
court.
in
1992,
congress
clarified
that
jurisdictional
grant
by
expressly
authorizing
patent
infringement
actions
against
states
and
state
instrumentalities.
given
the
fact
that
all
50
states
are
active
participants
in
the
patent
system,
florida
alone
has
obtained
over
200
patents
since
the
1992
act
was
passed.
it
is
not
only
incongruous
but
potentially
harmful
to
the
uniform
administration
of
this
branch
of
federal
law
to
conclude
that
that
the
states
might
simultaneously
enjoy
the
benefits
of
that
system
and
relay
on
the
defense
of
sovereign
immunity
when
charged
with
lawful
patent
infringement.
if
congress
does
not
have
the
power
to
provide
a
remedy
for
the
patentee
in
a
case
like
this,
and
if
it
cannot
compel
state
courts
to
entertain
suits
of
this
kind,
as
the
court
held
in
the
case
that
justice
kennedy
announced,
“there
is
a
gapping
hole
in
the
law
of
patents,
that
i
am
quite
sure
the
framers
of
the
constitution
did
not
envision.”
that
gapping
hole
is
the
product
of
this
court’s
decision
three
years
ago
in
the
seminole
tribe
case.
prior
to
that
decision
this
court
had
never
held
that
congress
power
to
compel
states
to
comply
with
federal
law
was
limited
by
the
doctrine
of
sovereign
immunity,
it
had
of
course
repeatedly
told
congress
that
statutes
limiting
state
authority
must
contain
a
clear
statement
that
congress
intended
them
to
apply
to
the
states.
the
1992
act
that
is
invalidated
in
this
case
is
one
of
several
that
congress
enacted
to
comply
with
that
requirement.
as
applied
by
the
court,
the
doctrine
of
sovereign
immunity
is
an
unjust
doctrine
because
it
denies
a
citizen,
a
remedy
authorized
by
congress
to
compel
state
instrumentalities
to
obey
federal
law.
the
principal
that
“no
man
is
above
the
law”,
which
applies
to
the
president
of
the
united
states,
as
well
as,
to
the
lowest
public
servant,
should
apply
equally
to
the
states
and
their
agents.
that
is
the
central
message
of
the
unambiguous
text
of
the
second
paragraph
of
article
vi
of
the
constitution
which
reads
as
follows:
“this
constitution,
and
the
laws
of
the
united
states
which
shall
be
made
in
pursuance
thereof;
and
all
treaties
made,
or
which
shall
be
made,
under
the
authority
of
the
united
states,
shall
be
the
supreme
law
of
the
land;
and
the
judges
in
every
state
shall
be
bound
thereby,
any
thing
in
the
constitution
or
laws
of
any
state
to
the
contrary
notwithstanding.”
it
is
this
provision
more
than
other
that
distinguishes
the
present
constitution
from
the
articles
of
confederation
that
it
replaced.
to
which
credit
the
court
does
claim
that
the
doctrine
of
sovereign
immunity
has
now
applied,
as
compelled
by
the
text
of
the
constitution.
it
is
a
judge
made
doctrine,
fashioned
out
of
judicial
perceptions
of
history
the
structure
of
the
constitution
and
a
concern
about
making
the
states
pay
money
damages
when
they
violate
federal
law.
what
is
lacking
in
the
pages
and
pages
of
writing
about
this
product
of
judicial
creativity
is
a
clear
statement
of
“why
any
sovereign
should
be
privileged
to
disobey
the
laws
of
another
sovereign”.
in
the
early
fifteenth
century,
when
henry
iv
was
the
king
of
england,
neither
the
fact
that
he
might
have
been
granted
immunity
from
french
law
by
the
king
of
france
as
a
matter
of
comity,
nor
the
fact
that
he
did
not
have
to
explain
why
he
could
claim
immunity
from
english
law,
sheds
any
light
at
all,
and
why
the
majority
of
this
court
now
believes
that
the
doctrine
of
sovereign
immunity
should
constrain
the
power
of
the
congress
of
the
united
states.
the
doctrine
i
fear
is
much
like
a
mindless
dragon
that
indiscriminately
choose
gapping
holes
in
federal
statutes.
justice
holmes
described
such
a
dragon
in
his
famous
essay
on
'the
path
of
the
law’.
when
you
get
the
dragon
out
of
his
cave
under
the
plain
and
in
the
day
light
you
can
count
his
teeth,
and
claws
and
see
just
what
is
his
strength,
but
to
get
him
out
is
only
the
first
step,
the
next
is
either
to
kill
him
or
to
tame
him
and
make
him
a
useful
animal.
for
the
rational
study
of
the
law
the
“black
letter
man”
may
be
the
man
of
the
present,
but
the
man
of
the
future
is
the
“man
of
statistics
and
the
master
of
economics”.
it
is
revolting
to
have
no
better
reason
for
a
rule
of
law
than
so
it
was
laid
down
in
the
time
of
henry
iv,
it
is
still
more
revolting
if
the
grounds
upon
which
it
was
laid
down
have
vanished
long
since
and
the
rule
simply
persists
from
blind
imitation
of
the
past.
the
past
that
the
court
has
chosen
to
imitate
today,
is
the
brief
period
of
confusion
and
crises
when
our
new
nation
was
governed
by
the
articles
of
confederation.

souter,
ginsburg
and
breyer,
