mr.
jonathan
a.
glogau
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
patent
and
plant
variety
remedy
clarification
act
of
1992
is
unconstitutional
because
it
is
not
appropriate
for
remedial
legislation
under
section
5
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
when
congress
considered
this
legislation,
it
did
not
consider
the
right
question,
that
is
whether
the
states
have
or
will
likely
deny
due
process
to
patentees.
rather,
it
only
looked
at
the
issue
of
whether
the
states
have
or
will
infringe
patents,
not
a
constitutional
wrong
in
and
of
itself.
mr.
jonathan
a.
glogau
mr.
chief
justice,
i...
that's
a
good
question.
it's
a
process
by
which
college
savings
bank
calculates
the
cost
of...
the
uncertain
cost
of
future
college
admissions
and...
and
it
also
includes
some
physical
things,
as
well
as
simply
the
process
of
calculating
the
amount.
they
sell--
mr.
jonathan
a.
glogau
--well,
justice
scalia,
this...
this
case
is
here
before
us
on
a
motion
to
dismiss
and
whether
or
not...
we
certainly
don't
admit
that
we've
infringed
on
the
patent.
our
contention
here
is
that
on
a
motion
to
dismiss
on
eleventh
amendment
immunity,
that
the...
the
act
itself
is
unconstitutional
because
it...
the
underpinnings
for
section
5
legislation
are
missing
here.
section
5
is
remedial
only.
this
court
has
been
very
clear
on
that.
in
city
of
boerne,
it
was...
it
was
emphasized
only
remedial
legislation
can
come
under
section
5.
the
act
here
suffers,
therefore,
from
the
same
fatal
defect
that
the
act...
that
the
religious
freedom
restoration
act
suffered
from,
and
that
is
that
neither
this
court
nor
congress
could
have
determined
or
did
determine
that
there
has
been
or
likely
will
be
a
violation
of
the
constitution.
the
mere
infringement
of
a
patent,
which
is
all
that
congress
really
addressed
and
really
is
all
that
the...
my
opponents
here
today
will
argue
i
think,
is
not
a
constitutional
wrong.
if
there
is
due
process
available
for
such
an
infringement,
then
the...
the
underpinnings,
as
i
said,
for
section
5
legislation
are
missing.
mr.
jonathan
a.
glogau
i'm
sorry.
mr.
jonathan
a.
glogau
in
the
jacobs
wind
case,
justice
stevens,
the
petitioner
in
that
case
brought
a
patent
infringement
case
against
the
state
of
florida
in
the
federal
court.
the
federal
circuit,
before
this
act
was
passed,
said
that
the
state
had
sovereign
immunity.
the
petitioner...
the
plaintiff
in
that
case
then
went
back
to
the
florida
state
courts,
and
the
florida
supreme
court
said
that
in
fact
we
will
provide
you
with
a
remedy
in
inverse
condemnation
or
tort
or...
or
any
number
of...
of
various
types
of
common
law
remedies.
the
petitioner...
the
respondents
in
this
case
and
the
united
states
argue
strongly
that
in
this
case
that
a
patent
is
property.
we
don't
dispute
that
patent
is
a
property
for
certain
purposes.
they
say...
they
cite
cases
that
say
that
a
patent
is
an
equivalent
for
a
patent
for
land.
they
say
that
it
is
personal
property.
mr.
jonathan
a.
glogau
that's
exactly
correct.
mr.
jonathan
a.
glogau
you
have
to
prove
that
there's
been
a
taking.
in
the
context
of
patent
infringement,
the...
the
issue...
the
most
important
right
found
in
a
patent
property,
as
argued
by
my
opponents
here,
is
the
right
to
exclude
use
by
other
people.
i
suggest
that--
mr.
jonathan
a.
glogau
--i'm
not
aware
that
any
case
like
that
has
ever
been
brought,
your
honor,
but
clearly
the
florida
supreme
court
said
that
that
remedy
is
available.
mr.
jonathan
a.
glogau
well,
i...
i
presume
you
could.
mr.
jonathan
a.
glogau
well,
no,
no.
i'll
take
that
one
back.
mr.
jonathan
a.
glogau
it
can
only
be
a
taking...
a
negligent
act
by
a...
a
state--
mr.
jonathan
a.
glogau
--never.
mr.
jonathan
a.
glogau
well--
mr.
jonathan
a.
glogau
--intent
is
an
element
of
patent
infringement?
i'm
not
aware
that
it
is.
mr.
jonathan
a.
glogau
well,
it's
not
coextensive,
but
that
doesn't
mean
it
denies
due
process,
your
honor.
mr.
jonathan
a.
glogau
well,
and
indeed,
the
federal
remedy
for
patent
infringement
is
exactly
congruent
to
the
remedy
i'm
suggesting
exists
in
the
state
law.
mr.
jonathan
a.
glogau
well,
your
honor,
at
that
point
you
go
to
patent
counsel
and
get
an
opinion,
and
that's
how
patent...
patent
lawsuits
progress.
mr.
jonathan
a.
glogau
yes,
i
would
concede
that,
your
honor,
that...
but...
but
the
problem
is
that...
that
just
because
the
state
is
accused
of
infringing
a
patent,
and
even
let's
assume
for
the
sake
of
argument,
that
the
patent
is
infringed,
that
is
not
a
constitutional
wrong.
and...
and
therefore,
the
underpinnings
for
section
5
legislation
are
missing.
mr.
jonathan
a.
glogau
your
honor,
it's
not
necessary
for
an
inverse
condemnation
case
to
be
prosecuted,
that
the
entity
being
accused
of
the
taking
have
the
power
of
eminent
domain.
for
example,
in
florida,
if
the
department
of
environmental
protection
denies
a
dredge
and
fill
permit
to
a
property
owner
and
that
denies
him
all
viable
use
of
his
property,
that
is
inverse
condemnation,
but
the
department
does
not
have
the
power
of
eminent
domain.
mr.
jonathan
a.
glogau
well,
you
could...
in...
in
the
patent
infringement
situation,
if
you're
looking
for
prospective
relief
to
stop
the
infringement,
you
have
an
ex
parte
young...
you
have
an
ex
parte
young--
mr.
jonathan
a.
glogau
--compensation
for
the
state's
exercise
of
its
police
power
or...
or
whatever
power--
mr.
jonathan
a.
glogau
--that's
correct.
the
constitution
does
not
prohibit
the
taking--
mr.
jonathan
a.
glogau
--well,
to
the
extent
that
the
tenth
amendment
prevents
congress
from
taking
away
powers
that
are
reserved
to
the
states,
i
think
the
general
power
of
eminent
domain
would
apply.
the
other
thing
is
that
in--
mr.
jonathan
a.
glogau
--well,
that's
the...
the
power
to
issue
the
patent
certainly
is
exclusively
within
the
federal
government.
the
states
are
not
permitted
to
issue
patents.
but
the...
the
likening
the
patent
to
a
patent
for
land,
as
the...
my
opponents
here
today
do,
if
a...
the
federal
government
issues
a
patent
for
land
to...
to
whiteacre,
under
their
theory
and
under
the
theory
you're
espousing
right
now,
it
would
seem
that
the
state's
eminent
domain
power
would
not
reach
that
as
well
because
it's...
it's
a...
a
patent
granted
by
the
federal
government.
and
i
think
that
that...
that
goes
too
far.
clearly
the...
the
state
can,
if
it's
in
the
public
interest,
if
it's
for
a
public
use
and
compensation
is
provided,
that
the
state...
for
example,
if
somebody
invented
a...
a
mechanism
for
tracking
hurricanes--
mr.
jonathan
a.
glogau
--well,
i
think
that
the
state--
mr.
jonathan
a.
glogau
--i
don't
think
that
there's
any...
i
don't
think
there's
any
limitation
inherent
in
federal
law
that
prevents
the
taking
of
the
patent.
no,
i
don't.
i
think
that
it
can
take...
be
taken.
mr.
jonathan
a.
glogau
well,
that--
mr.
jonathan
a.
glogau
--that's
absolutely
correct.
mr.
jonathan
a.
glogau
the
uniformity
has
several
components,
your
honor.
the
first
one
is
a
uniformity
of
the
interpretation
of
the
law
itself,
and
i
think
that
a
doctrine
based
on...
on
the
inability
of
the
states
to
apply
the
precedents
of
the
federal
circuit
is...
is...
runs
counter
to
basic
concept
of--
mr.
jonathan
a.
glogau
--but
if...
if
there
is
a--
mr.
jonathan
a.
glogau
--that's
exactly--
mr.
jonathan
a.
glogau
--that
is
one
of
the
functions
of
this
court--
mr.
jonathan
a.
glogau
--the--
mr.
jonathan
a.
glogau
--the
federal
circuit
was
not
created
until
fairly
recently
in
the
200-year
history
of
patents.
mr.
jonathan
a.
glogau
if...
if
that
judgment
is
correct,
that
the
uniformity
that--
mr.
jonathan
a.
glogau
--but
that's
a
legislative
preference,
your
honor,
because--
mr.
jonathan
a.
glogau
--if...
if--
mr.
jonathan
a.
glogau
--if
the
federal
circuit
is
necessary--
mr.
jonathan
a.
glogau
--if
the
federal
circuit
is
necessary
to
grant
due
process
to
patent
holders,
then
what
you're
suggesting
is
that
from
1790
until
the--
mr.
jonathan
a.
glogau
--your--
mr.
jonathan
a.
glogau
--no,
i
don't
think
so
because
the
differences
in
remedies
between
the
federal
remedy
and
a
state
remedy
has
never
been
in
this
court's
jurisprudence
a...
a
due
process
question.
mr.
jonathan
a.
glogau
well,
your
honor,
the
basis...
extending
that
argument,
the
basis
that
congress
used
to...
to
enact
this
abrogation
of
state
sovereign
immunity
is,
in
effect,
that
they
felt
that
the
states
needed
to
be
treated
like
everyone
else.
and
that's
exactly
what
the
eleventh
amendment
is...
is...
is
there
for.
mr.
jonathan
a.
glogau
that's
correct.
it
also
did
not--
mr.
jonathan
a.
glogau
--that's
correct.
mr.
jonathan
a.
glogau
under...
under
article
i,
under
the
patent
clause,
congress
can
make
that
judgment
for
everyone
except
the
states
because
the
eleventh
amendment
prohibits
them
under
seminole
tribe.
mr.
jonathan
a.
glogau
that's
correct
because
the
states'
infringement
of
patents
has
never
been
shown
to
be
a
constitutional
due
process
violation.
mr.
jonathan
a.
glogau
in
fact--
mr.
jonathan
a.
glogau
--that's
correct.
mr.
jonathan
a.
glogau
i'm
sorry.
i
do
not,
chief
justice.
mr.
jonathan
a.
glogau
that's
correct.
28
u.s.c.
1498
is
the
answer
to
the...
one
of
the
answers
to
the
uniformity
thing...
question,
and
that
is
that
it's
not--
mr.
jonathan
a.
glogau
--i'm
sorry.
it
already
is
not
uniform.
1498
gives
the
federal...
gives
you
a
different
remedy
against
the
federal
government,
and
i
suggest
that
if
someone
has
a
patent
and
it's
infringed
in
california,
a
federal
district
court
in
california
might
award
a
certain
amount
of
damages.
if
the
same
patent
is
infringed
in
new
york,
the
federal
district
court
of
new
york
might
come
out
with
a
different
amount
of
damages.
so,
the
whole...
and...
and,
of
course,
with
this
court's
ability
to
review
ultimately
the
consistency
of
the
state
law...
of
the
state
decisions
with
the
federal
circuits'
precedents,
the
uniformity
is
sufficient.
mr.
jonathan
a.
glogau
1498.
mr.
jonathan
a.
glogau
i
would
suggest
that
a
remedy
like
that
would
be
more
congruent
with
any
perceived
harm,
but
again
i...
i--
mr.
jonathan
a.
glogau
--do
not
concede
that
there
is
a...
a
constitutional
basis
for
section
5
legislation
here
because
there
is
no
due
process
violation.
mr.
jonathan
a.
glogau
my
view
of
the--
mr.
jonathan
a.
glogau
--well,
my
view
of
the
constitution
is
that
the
eleventh
amendment
prohibits
an...
a...
an
act
like
this.
the...
the
underpinning
assumptions
that
are
used
here
is
that,
first
of
all,
that
states
are
going
to
be
rogue
patent
and
copyright
infringers
out
there.
mr.
jonathan
a.
glogau
well,
that--
mr.
jonathan
a.
glogau
--but...
but
the
point
is
that
the
vast
majority
of
the
cases
that
are
going
to
be
brought
under
the
patent
act
are
not
going
to
be
cases
against
the
states.
so,
for
whatever
percentage
it
is,
you
know,
the
huge
percentage
of
them,
there
will
be
a
quick
and...
and
federal
court
remedy
for
patent
infringement.
it's
only
when
you
address
the
states
that
you
have
to
make
special--
mr.
jonathan
a.
glogau
--to
the
extent
that
any
of
those
issues
that
you've
raised
constitute
property
that
is
protectable
under
the
fourteenth
amendment,
once
again
unless
there's
a
premise
that
there's
been
some
unconstitutional
conduct,
then
the
states
must
be
allowed
to
create
their
own
remedies.
until...
unless
and
until
those
remedies
are
proven
to
be
inadequate,
then
congress
has
not...
is
not
remedying
anything.
the
key
issue
in
the
city
of
boerne
case
was
if
congress
is
not
remedying
something,
then
they
don't
have
authority
under
section
5,
and
that
is
the
case
here.
this
is
exactly
the
same
as
city
of
boerne.
mr.
jonathan
a.
glogau
no,
i
think--
mr.
jonathan
a.
glogau
--we
also
have
nafta
where...
where--
mr.
jonathan
a.
glogau
--no.
i
think
that's
a
separate
issue
that
has
to
be
dealt
with
by
the...
those
responsible
for
that.
mr.
jonathan
a.
glogau
certainly
it
can't...
i
would
have
to
concede
that
the
states
are
engaging
in
activities
that
are
involved
with
intellectual
property
more
today
than
they
were
100
years
ago.
however,
the
fact
that
the
state
of
florida
has
200
patents...
that's
one
side
of
the
patent
process,
and
that
does
not
imply...
i
don't
see
any
connection
between
that
and
the
fact
that
florida
will
now
all
of
a
sudden
be
accused
of
infringing
200
patents.
mr.
jonathan
a.
glogau
no,
because
if
the
state
denies
even
the
first
person
due
process,
then
under
a...
a
proceeding
like
what
happened
in
the
mckesson
case,
this
court
ultimately
will
be
able
to
say
to
the
state
of
florida,
you've
denied
this
person
due
process.
you
need
to
give
them
a
real
remedy.
i
suggest
that
the
state
of
florida,
the
supreme
court
of
florida
has
said
to
patentees
who've
claimed
that
the
state
has
infringed
on
their
patents,
we
will
give
you
a
meaningful
remedy.
that
being
the
case,
our
sovereign
immunity
under
the
eleventh
amendment
simply
can't
be
abrogated
because
congress
may
think
that
the
state
of
west
virginia
doesn't
provide
due
process,
although
of
course,
the
record
before
this
court
and
before
congress
doesn't...
doesn't
suggest
that.
the
united
states
in
their
brief
at
footnote
9
admits
that
takings
liability
does
not
require
a...
an
independent
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity.
so,
i
suggest
that
every
state
has
takings
remedies.
and
if
you
look
at
cases
like
the
kaiser
aetna
case
and
the
loretto
v.
teleprompter
case,
the
doctrines
that
govern
inverse
condemnation
are
flexible
enough
to
address
these
questions.
in
kaiser
aetna--
mr.
jonathan
a.
glogau
--yes,
there
certainly
are.
conversion,
all
sorts
of
state
tort
remedies
exist.
mr.
jonathan
a.
glogau
congress
would
have
authority
to
address
the
problem
under
section
5.
i
suggest
that
the
balancing
test
then
in
city
of
boerne
between
the
evil
and
the
remedy
then
comes
into
play.
and
i
would
suggest
as
a
model
the...
the
preclearance
procedures
in
the
voting
rights
act
where
at
least
the
attorney
general
or
someone
has
to
make
a
determination
up
front
that
the
state...
this
particular
state
has...
has
violated
someone's
due
process
rights,
and
then
in
that
state,
maybe
the
remedy
could
be
provided.
but
to
simply
wipe
away
the
eleventh
amendment
immunity
of
all
the
states
because
there
may
be
some
pockets
of
problems
is
inconsistent.
and
if
i
might,
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time.
mr.
jonathan
a.
glogau
absolutely.
the
state
court
could
be...
can
be
relied
upon
i
think
to...
to
apply
the
federal
circuit
precedent.
mr.
jonathan
a.
glogau
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
with
all
due
respect
to
general
waxman,
it
seems
that
they
are
taking
an
inconsistent
position
here.
in
their
brief,
on
page
16
and
17,
the
united
states
cites
to
several
cases
that
say,
for
example,
patents
are
property
and
entitled
to
the
same
rights
and
sanctions
as
other
property.
again,
for
the...
by
the
laws
of
the
united
states,
the
rights
of
a
party
under
a
patent
are
his
private
property.
similarly,
college
savings
bank
cites
at
page
20
of
their...
of
their
brief,
under
the
court's
holding
in
consolidated
fruit
jar,
a
patent
for
an
invention
is
as
much
property
as
a
patent
for
land,
an
uncompensated,
state
sponsored
violation
of
a
patent
owner's
right
to
exclude
also
must
constitute
a
taking.
after
taking
these
positions,
to
assert
that
the
common
law
remedies
available
in
the
state
courts
for
takings
torts
or
whatever
are
a
violation
of
due
process
just
seems
inconsistent
to
me.
in
james
v.
campbell...
it's
a
federal
case
from
the
late
1800's...
said
in
fact
that
the
infringing
of
a
patent
by
the
federal
government
is
a
taking.
so,
once
again,
to
assert
that
the
infringement
by
the
state
cannot
be
remedied
by
an
adequate
state
taking
remedy
is
simply
inconsistent.
mr.
jonathan
a.
glogau
oh,
i
disagree.
the
way...
the
way
the
way
the
statute
is
written
today,
that
is
true,
but
the
statute
could
be
written
to
give
the
united
states
the
ability
to
enforce
a
patent.
i
don't...
i
don't
see
why
congress
couldn't
write
that.
mr.
jonathan
a.
glogau
that's
correct.
mr.
jonathan
a.
glogau
but
again,
i
agree.
the
statute
is
not
written
that
way,
but
there
certainly
is
a
huge
patent
and
trademark
office
out
there
by
the
airport,
and
they
employ
a
lot
of
people.
congress
could
certainly
create
and
give
them
enough
money
to
enforce
the
patents.
that
is
certainly
within
congress'
ability
because,
of
course,
the
united...
the
states
have
no
sovereign
immunity
as
against
the
united
states.
so,
that...
that's
a
possibility.
whether
it's,
you
know--
mr.
jonathan
a.
glogau
--why
is
that
the
united...
that
states
have
no
eleventh
amendment
immunity?
because
as
the
framers
indicated
in
the
plan
of
the
convention,
it's
necessary
that
the
states,
in
creating
the
union,
had
waived
their
sovereign
immunity
with
respect
to
suits
by
the
united
states,
because
there
has
to
be
someone,
some...
some
authority
that
can...
can
adjudicate
and
deal
with
differences
among
the
states.
and
that's...
that's
the
job
of
the
federal
government.
i'd
also
say
that
in
terms
of
applying
the
federal
circuit
patent
law
precedents,
state
courts
are
often
called
upon
to
apply
federal
law
and...
and
foreign
law,
and
they...
they
certainly
have
the
ability
to
do
that.
but
the
bottom
line,
as
general
waxman
said,
congress...
congress
perceived
there
to
be
a
problem
out
there,
and
maybe
there
is.
but
the
problem
is
not
of
constitutional
dimension.
the
problem
may
be
that
the
states
are
going
to
be
involved
in
patent
infringement--
