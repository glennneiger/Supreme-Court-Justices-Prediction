mr.
jeffrey
m.
sewell
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
want
to
speak
to
you
first
this
morning
about
the
jurisdiction
issues
in
this
case.
this
case
presents
the
question
of
how,
not
whether,
but
how
the
tax
injunction
act
applies
to
a
tax
collection
case
removed
to
federal
court.
that,
in
turn,
depends
on
whether
the
act
is
interpreted
and
applied
as
a
broad
jurisdictional
barrier
or
simply
as
a
limitation
on
a
court's
remedial
power.
we
say
that
the...
the
act
should
be
applied
broadly
to
keep
collection
cases
out
of
federal
court
altogether
because
any
lesser
approach,
any
more
narrow
approach
is
just...
is
unworkable.
mr.
jeffrey
m.
sewell
yes,
sir.
mr.
jeffrey
m.
sewell
that's
right.
mr.
jeffrey
m.
sewell
i
say
that
the
tax
injunction
act
ought
to
apply
to
a
tax
collection
case
whether
it's
removed
by
a
defendant
by
a
taxpayer
to
federal
court
or
whether
we
had
brought
the
case
ourself
in
federal
court.
i
think
the
tax
injunction
act
should
bar...
should
keep
these
cases
out
of
federal
court
for
a
number
of
reasons.
the--
mr.
jeffrey
m.
sewell
--the
reason
is,
is
because
if
you
have
some
lesser
approach,
it's
just
not
workable.
the
tax
injunction
act
is
going
to
apply
in
some
form
or
fashion
if
a
case
is
removed,
a
collection
case
is
removed.
for...
for
example,
if
you
go
into
federal
court
in
a
tax
collection
case,
the...
it
seems
to
me
that
that
would
allow
the
taxing
authority,
me
in
this
case,
the
government,
to
use
the
tax
injunction
act
as
both
a
sword
and
a
shield
to
whipsaw
a
taxpayer.
mr.
jeffrey
m.
sewell
yes,
your
honor,
i
do.
i
believe...
and
i
look
to
footnote
22
partially
of
the
grace
brethren
church
opinion.
mr.
jeffrey
m.
sewell
i
thought
it
was
a
good
place
to
look.
[laughter]
and...
and
when
i
went
back
and
read
that
footnote,
that
footnote
gives
a
very
thorough
history
and
analysis
of
the
tax
injunction
act,
and
it
quotes
the
senators
and
the
members
of
congress
that
were
responsible
for
enacting
that
act.
and
that
footnote
demonstrates...
demonstrated
to
me
conclusively
that
the
purpose
of
the
tax
injunction
act,
the
central
purpose,
was
to
keep
a
federal
court
from
interfering
in
any
manner
in
a
state
tax
if
there's
an
adequate
state
remedy.
that
seems
to
me
to
be
the...
the
clear
purpose.
mr.
jeffrey
m.
sewell
i
think
that
the
act...
i
wish
that
the
act
had...
had
said
that,
and
i
think
that
that's...
you
know,
the
act
talks
in
terms
of
federal
courts
not
having
the
jurisdiction
to...
to
enjoin,
suspend
or
restrain
a
levy,
assessment,
or
collection
of
a
state
tax.
but,
in
effect,
your
honor,
that's
what
happened
here.
mr.
jeffrey
m.
sewell
that's
right.
mr.
jeffrey
m.
sewell
it
does,
and
the...
i'm
assuming
that
the
purpose
of
the
tax
injunction
act,
the
overreaching
purpose,
is
to
prevent
a
federal
court
from
interfering
with
the
collection
or
the
administration
of
state
tax,
and
i
believe
that's
what
the
court's
grace
brethren
church
opinion,
specifically
footnote
22...
that's
exactly
what
it
said.
now,
the...
the
way
i
see
this,
the...
in
this
case,
the
federal
court
did
interfere
with
the
collection,
not
only
of
our
tax.
in
this
case...
this
case
has
stopped
us
from
collecting
the
tax
not
only
from
the
respondents,
but
from
all
the
federal
judges
in
the
northern
district.
it's
exposed
us
to
refund
suits
from
the
other
judges
who
paid
the
tax
other...
other
than
these
two
respondents.
it's
resulted
now
in
hundreds
of
federal
employees
that
work
in
jefferson
county
refusing
now
to
pay
the
tax,
demanding
explanations
from
us
as
to...
as
to
why
they
have
to
pay
if
the
judges
don't
have
to
pay.
we're
having
now
to
respond
to
all
of
that,
and
it
looks
as
though
we
may...
we
may
have
to--
mr.
jeffrey
m.
sewell
--i
think
that
there
would...
we
may
have
some...
some
of
the
same
results,
but
i
think
again
the
purpose
of
the
tax
injunction
act
is
to
keep
the
federal
court
from
doing
that.
mr.
jeffrey
m.
sewell
i
think
that
you
may
have
some
of
the
same
results
and
you
may
have
some
of
the
same
displeasure
from
the
federal
employees,
certainly.
certainly.
mr.
jeffrey
m.
sewell
this
case.
mr.
jeffrey
m.
sewell
well,
your
honor,
i
think
that--
mr.
jeffrey
m.
sewell
--i
think
this
court
would
certainly
have
appellate
jurisdiction
to
review
the
decision
of
the
alabama
supreme
court.
mr.
jeffrey
m.
sewell
i
think
that
your
jurisdictional...
and
i
understand
your
point
and
you're
correct,
but
your...
your
basis
for
an
appellate
review
of
a
state
court
decision
is
different
from
what
i'm
suggesting
to
you.
i'm
talking
about
jurisdiction
at
the
trial
level,
the
initial
federal
jurisdiction.
perhaps
i'm
using...
i'm
painting
with
too
broad
of
a
brush.
maybe
i
am.
mr.
jeffrey
m.
sewell
yes,
ma'am.
mr.
jeffrey
m.
sewell
yes,
ma'am.
i
had
planned
to
argue
that.
we
feel
that
under
1442
that...
that
neither
test
is
met
because
refusing
to
pay
taxes
is
not
an
act
done
under
the
color
of
a
judge's
office,
and
it's
not
done
in
the
performance
of
any
judicial
duty.
i
know
of
no
federal
statute,
i
know
of
no
act
of
congress
that...
that
instructs
a
judge
to
not
pay
his
or
her
taxes.
mr.
jeffrey
m.
sewell
i
think
that...
that
perhaps
it
is,
and
i
certainly...
and
i
don't
suggest
to
you
that...
that...
that
the
judge
would
have
to
win
on
the
merits
to...
to
have
jurisdiction.
but
i...
i
do
suggest
to
you
that
there
has
to
be
something
colorable
about
the
defense
that's
pled,
and
to
me
if...
if...
if
the
people
in
mesa
v.
california
couldn't
convince
the
court
that...
that
when
they
ran
over
somebody
in
their...
in
their
postal
buggies
that
they
were
engaged
in
their
official
function,
i
don't
see
how
not
paying
a
tax
would
satisfy
that.
certainly
if
these
judges
didn't
pay
alabama's
income
tax--
mr.
jeffrey
m.
sewell
--no,
sir.
i
disagree
with
that.
the
tax...
the
ordinance
says
that
it's
unlawful
to
work
in
the
county
without
paying
the
tax.
the
court
of
appeals
seized
on
that
language,
but
that...
what
they
failed
to
do...
they
failed
to
do
two
things.
one
of
those
things
was
they
failed
to
recognize
the
difference
between
a
license
tax
which
is
for
revenue
purposes,
which
is
what
ours
is,
which
stems
from
our
taxing
power,
versus
a
license
tax
for
regulatory
purposes
which
stems
from
the
police
power.
mr.
jeffrey
m.
sewell
no,
ma'am.
we're
prohibited
from
doing
that
by
the
alabama
constitution.
mr.
jeffrey
m.
sewell
under
federal
law
it
clearly
is
an
income
tax.
mr.
jeffrey
m.
sewell
under
state
law.
mr.
jeffrey
m.
sewell
just
as
in
howard
v.
commissioners,
yes,
ma'am.
mr.
jeffrey
m.
sewell
no,
sir.
it
is
clearly
under
alabama
law
a
license
tax.
mr.
jeffrey
m.
sewell
i
will
persuade
you,
your
honor.
i'll
try
to
persuade
you
with
the...
with
the
howard
v.
commissioners
decision
where
you
all
persuaded
me--
[laughter]
--that
a...
that
a
license--
mr.
jeffrey
m.
sewell
--that
a
license
tax
in
louisville,
kentucky
that
is
indistinguishable
from
our
tax
was
an
income
tax
under
the
buck
act.
mr.
jeffrey
m.
sewell
because
the
buck
act
makes
it
an
income
tax.
congress...
congress
converted
all
state
and
local
license
taxes
to
be
income
taxes
under
federal
law.
mr.
jeffrey
m.
sewell
that
is
a...
i
would
think,
a
discriminatory
tax
that
would
violate
the--
mr.
jeffrey
m.
sewell
--i
don't
know.
mr.
jeffrey
m.
sewell
your
honor,
in
answer
to
your
question,
i
disagree
first
with
the
word
vast.
92
percent
of
the
people
who
earn
wages
in
our
county
pay
our
tax.
92
percent.
8
percent
pay
license
fees
to
the
state
of
alabama,
and
those
are
predominantly
federal
employees.
mr.
jeffrey
m.
sewell
it
comes...
that
is...
that
number
is
not
in
the
record
because
this
issue
was
never
raised
until
we
got
to
this
court.
mr.
jeffrey
m.
sewell
well,
this...
this
information
is
not
in
the
record,
nor
is
the
fact
that
1,209
of
the
12,000
federal
employees
in
jefferson
county...
1,209
of
them...
pay
state
license
fees
and
do
not
pay
our
tax.
mr.
jeffrey
m.
sewell
exemptions.
some,
yes,
there
are
some.
some
of
them
were.
some
were,
of
course,
domestic
servants--
mr.
jeffrey
m.
sewell
--as
i
understand
it,
yes.
mr.
jeffrey
m.
sewell
there
was...
there
was...
yes,
sir.
there
was
a
separate
law,
and
whether
it
was
a
state
law
or
whether
it
was
a
city
law,
that
i
don't
know.
but
it...
but
when
you
read
it
carefully,
you
see
that
it
applies
to
insurance
companies
and
then
other
corporations,
persons
that
are
taxed
by
these
other
sections
of
louisville
law
or
by
kentucky
law.
so,
the
louisville
occupational
tax
had
exemptions.
i
don't
know
how
broad
they
were.
i
don't
know
how
narrow
they
were.
i
know
how
narrow
ours
are.
it's
only
8
percent
of
the
people.
i
don't
know
how...
how
broad
or
narrow
louisville's
was.
mr.
jeffrey
m.
sewell
that's
right.
mr.
jeffrey
m.
sewell
it
does.
mr.
jeffrey
m.
sewell
and
ours
is,
yes,
sir.
there's
no
dispute
about
that.
mr.
jeffrey
m.
sewell
no,
sir.
our
tax
does
not...
our
tax
does
not
discriminate
against
any
person,
federal
or
otherwise.
mr.
jeffrey
m.
sewell
the...
i
understand.
mr.
jeffrey
m.
sewell
as
i
understand--
mr.
jeffrey
m.
sewell
--well,
i
think
that
there
is...
i
think
that
there
is
factual
discrimination
because
we
have...
our
tax
applies
to
this
group
and
the
state
levies
its
license
fee
on
the
others.
and
what
that
is
is
just
a
simple
division
of
taxing
authority.
mr.
jeffrey
m.
sewell
some.
some
are
and...
and
some
are
not.
mr.
jeffrey
m.
sewell
it
depends
on
how--
mr.
jeffrey
m.
sewell
--it
depends
on
how
much...
how
much
money
a
person
makes.
mr.
jeffrey
m.
sewell
well,
if...
if
a...
yes.
depending
on...
depending
on
a...
how
much
a
person
would
make,
they
could
pay
more
instead
of
less--
mr.
jeffrey
m.
sewell
--okay,
i'm
with
you,
and
i
don't...
i
don't
know
if
it
is.
i
really
don't.
i
doubt
that
it
is,
but--
mr.
jeffrey
m.
sewell
--because
i
read
davis
v.
michigan
as...
as
the
problem
with
that
tax
was
that
it
discriminated
against
federal
employees
by
favoring
state
employees--
mr.
jeffrey
m.
sewell
--because
of
the
source
of
the
compensation,
which
is
what
the
public
salary
tax
act
says.
there
may
be
other
forms
of
factual
discrimination.
mr.
jeffrey
m.
sewell
the
eleventh
circuit
said...
noted
that
the
trial
court
found
that
the
tax
did
not
discriminate
and
went
on
to
say
the
judges
didn't
appeal
it,
and
so
they
were
not
going
to
address
it.
mr.
jeffrey
m.
sewell
it
applies
to
all
constitutional
officers
of
the
state
of
alabama.
mr.
jeffrey
m.
sewell
yes,
ma'am,
who
work
in
jefferson
county,
alabama.
mr.
jeffrey
m.
sewell
just
like
the
federal
judges,
and
the
alabama
supreme
court
justices,
three
of
those
who
have
offices
in
our
county,
satellite
offices,
pay
the--
mr.
jeffrey
m.
sewell
--prosecutors
may
be...
i
think
prosecutors
are
required
to
have
a
state
law
license.
mr.
jeffrey
m.
sewell
they
pay
the
state
law
license.
mr.
jeffrey
m.
sewell
yes,
ma'am.
that's
very
important.
it's
also
true
for
the
doctors
who
work
at
the
va
hospital.
we
have
a
large
va
hospital.
all
of
the
doctors
and
all
of
the
nurses
are
required
by
their
federal
job
descriptions
to
have
a
state
physician's
license
to
practice
medicine
and
the
nurses
are
required
to
have
a
state
nursing
license
to
be
a
nurse
for
the
federal
government.
mr.
jeffrey
m.
sewell
yes,
sir.
mr.
jeffrey
m.
sewell
yes.
mr.
jeffrey
m.
sewell
yes,
sir.
thank
you.
i
wish
i
had
thought
of
that.
[laughter]
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time,
please,
if
there's
no
more
questions.
mr.
jeffrey
m.
sewell
yes,
sir.
a
couple
things
very
quickly.
our
motion
to
remand
does
include
1442.
i'm
holding
a
copy
of
it
in
my
hand.
the
buck
act...
buck
act
has
to
be
as
broad
as
the
public
salary
tax
act
to
accomplish
the
purpose
of
putting
employees
in
a
federal
area
in
the
same
posture
as
those
who
are
not
in
a
federal
area.
what
mr.
morrison
is
telling
you
is,
is
that
the
public
salary
tax
act
doesn't
consent
to
a
license
tax.
and
i
say
that
it
does,
and
i
won't
repeat
what
i've
told
you
in
my
briefs
because
i
think
that
it's
very
clear
that
it
does.
and
it...
and
it
has
to.
the
o'malley
cite
that
you
asked
for
is
307
u.s.
277.
also
another
case
on
the
issue,
united
states
v.
will,
w-i-l-l,
449
u.s.
200.
final
thing.
this
case...
where
the
trial
court
went
wrong,
where
the
court
of
appeals
went
wrong
is
by
blurring
the
distinction
between
the
government,
the
united
states,
and
its
employees.
and
i
think
it
really
is
just
that
simple.
certainly
when
you
all
sit
on
this
court
and
you're
asking
me
questions,
you're
performing
your
duties,
but
when
you
all
are
paying
your
taxes,
you're
acting
as
citizens.
you're
not...
i
just
don't
think
that
you're
the
united
states
government
when
you
pay
your
taxes
any
more
than
you're
the
united
states
government
when
you
pay
your
credit
card
bills.
mr.
jeffrey
m.
sewell
yes,
ma'am.
mr.
jeffrey
m.
sewell
if
that
were
so,
there
would
be,
but
that's
not
so.
and
this...
that
argument...
every
time
we
go
to
a
different
court,
that
argument
changes,
and
it
has
changed
now.
now...
now,
for
the
first
time,
we're
claiming
that
there's
some
discrimination,
and
mr.
morrison
told
you
that
federal
employees
can't
get
our
exemptions.
i
told
you
this
morning,
a
while
ago,
that
1,209
of
the
12,000
federal
employees
in
jefferson
county
have
our
exemptions.
they
can
get
them.
they
have
them.
that's
10
percent.
mr.
jeffrey
m.
sewell
my
response
is,
is
that
kentucky
also
prohibits
its
cities
by
state
law
from
levying
an
income
tax,
and
that
all
of
the
exemptions,
the
exemptions
for
insurance
companies
and
the
others,
in...
in
the
ordinance
that
this
court
considered
in
howard...
those
other
exemptions...
my
understanding
is,
when
you
go
back...
you've
got
the
ordinance.
you
go
back
and
look
at
it,
you
will
see
that
they
are
flat
fees.
it's
the
same
situation.
mr.
jeffrey
m.
sewell
you
mean
howard?
howard
v.
michigan.
1953.
and
you
all...
we
struggled
to
get
that
ordinance.
you've
got
it
now.
you've
got
the
actual
ordinance
that
was
at
issue
in
that
howard
v.
commissioners
case.
and
it's
just...
it's
virtually
identical.
how
did...
how
did
the
court
reach
the
conclusion
in
that
case,
which
the
court
reached
and
it
had
to
reach,
that
there
was
any
basis
at
all
for
a
federal
employee
to
pay
a
license
tax
if
congress
didn't
consent
to
a
license
tax?
mr.
jeffrey
m.
sewell
i
think
that...
that
there--
mr.
jeffrey
m.
sewell
--i
think
it
answers.
i
think
it
does
answer
itself.
i
think
that
there...
there's
no...
there
has
to
be
some...
mr.
morrison
says
the
buck
act
doesn't
consent
to
anything.
there
has
to
be
some
consent
for
the
court
to
have
reached
its
conclusion
in
the
howard
case
that
federal
employees
must
pay
a
license
tax,
otherwise
there's--
mr.
jeffrey
m.
sewell
--thank
you.
