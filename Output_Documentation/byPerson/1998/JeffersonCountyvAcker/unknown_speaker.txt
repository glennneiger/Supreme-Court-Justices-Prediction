unknown
speaker
well,
in
this
case,
mr.
sewell,
the...
the
county
brought
the
action
in
state
court,
didn't
it,
to
collect
the
taxes?
unknown
speaker
and
then
the
defendants...
the
judges
removed
it
to
federal
court.
unknown
speaker
and
so,
it...
you
say
at
that
point
the
tax
injunction
act
applied
to
prevent
the
state
from...
from
collecting
a
tax?
unknown
speaker
go
ahead.
unknown
speaker
well,
what...
what
if
this
action
had
been
brought
in
state
court
to
collect
taxes
on
the
basis,
say,
of
diversity
of
citizenship,
and
it
was
removed
on
that
basis
to
the
federal
court
and
there
was
no
claim
that
the
tax
was
unconstitutional?
maybe
there
was
just
a
claim
that
it
had
been
paid
and
the
county
said,
no,
it
hasn't
been
paid.
you
think
the
tax
injunction
act
would
still
apply?
unknown
speaker
well,
that's
not
the
greatest
place
to
look
for
controlling
law.
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
well,
then
why
didn't
the
act
simply
say
the
federal
courts
have
no
jurisdiction
in
state
tax
cases?
unknown
speaker
i
don't
understand
that
because
the...
the
suit
didn't
change
its
shape
from
being
a
suit
to
collect,
not
a
suit
to
enjoin,
but
a
suit
to
collect.
that's
what
it
was.
unknown
speaker
and
that
was
what
was
removed,
and
it
remains
a
suit
to
collect.
unknown
speaker
well,
why
would
that
be
any
different
as
if
it
were
just
in
state
court
and
a
state
court
judge
said,
well,
i
have
real
problems
with
this?
i'm
going
to
take
it
under
submission,
and
the
word
gets
out.
it's
the
same
thing.
unknown
speaker
but
the
purpose
of
diversity
jurisdiction
is
to
provide
a...
basically
a
more
neutral
forum
perhaps
than
the
state
court
but
to
resolve
the
case
in
exactly
the
same
way
that
the
state
court
would
have
resolved
it.
so,
if...
if
there
had
been
a
decision
of
the
alabama
court
saying
that
this
was...
couldn't
be
applied
to...
you'd
have
the
same
claims,
wouldn't
you,
on
the
part
of
federal
employees?
unknown
speaker
what
if
the
alabama
supreme
court
finally
decides
that
the
tax
can
be
collected
and
then
certiorari
is
sought
here?
i
mean,
it
stays
in
the
alabama
court.
it
goes
all
the
way--
unknown
speaker
--yes.
it
goes
all
the
way
to
the
supreme
court,
and
the
supreme
court
says
the
tax
can
be
collected.
and
then
the
judges
seek
certiorari.
we
grant
certiorari.
if
we
reverse
the
alabama
supreme
court,
would
we
be
enjoining
a
state
tax?
unknown
speaker
under
your
analysis,
we
would
i
suppose.
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
under
your
broad
definition
of
what
constitutes
the...
the...
enjoining
of
a
state
tax...
namely,
to
give
a
judgment
against
a
person
who
is
resisting
the
collection
of
a
state
tax...
we
would
be
violating
the
anti-injunction
act.
unknown
speaker
do
you
plan
to
argue
that
removal
was
improper
under
section
1442(a)(3)?
unknown
speaker
i'm
not
sure
you're
going
to
win
on
your
tax
injunction
argument.
i
wondered
if
you
wanted
to
pursue
that
other
inquiry.
unknown
speaker
i
guess
the
inquiry
under
1442
is
pretty
much
tied
up
with
the
merits
of
whether
the
tax
can
be
imposed.
unknown
speaker
but...
but
this
tax
says
that
it's
unlawful
to
perform
the
function,
i.e.,
it's
unlawful
to
be
a
judge
if
you
don't
pay
the
tax.
unknown
speaker
let
me
ask
you
this.
does
the
county
have
any
authority
to
impose
an
income
tax?
unknown
speaker
and
yet,
for
you
to
prevail,
you
have
to
persuade
us
that
this
is
in
fact
an
income
tax.
unknown
speaker
even
though
the
county
lacks
the
power
to--
unknown
speaker
--impose
an
income--
unknown
speaker
--why
is
it
clearly
an
income
tax?
it
doesn't
say
it's
an
income
tax.
unknown
speaker
yes,
fine.
so,
you
said,
to
win,
which
i
think
you're
right,
that
you'd
have
to
persuade
us
it's
an
income
tax.
all
right.
why
is
it
an
income
tax?
persuade
us
or
me.
unknown
speaker
i
must
not
have
written
that.
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
and
why...
why
is
it...
i
mean,
this...
why
is
it
basically
an
income
tax?
unknown
speaker
so...
so,
if
you
pass
a
tax
that
says
anybody
who...
anybody...
take
an
unpopular
matter.
anyone
who
applies
the
federal
sentencing
guidelines
will
pay
a
tax
measured
by
their
income.
is
that
an
income
tax?
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
is
it
an
income
tax?
unknown
speaker
all
right.
now,
here
they're...
we
read
the
opposition's
brief
and
they
say,
first,
it
doesn't
say
it's
an
income
tax,
and
second,
there
are
vast
numbers
of
employees
who
don't
pay
it
measured
by
their
income.
they
pay
it
measured
by
$50
a
year.
they
include...
we
just
have
the
a's
i
guess...
architects,
attorneys,
auctioneers,
automobile
dealers,
automobile
accessory
dealers,
and
that's
only
the
a's
and
i'm
only
halfway
through.
all
right?
so...
so,
vast
numbers
of
people
pay
$50
a
year,
$125
a
year.
some
people
pay
it
measured
on
their
income,
and
it's
also
not
called
an
income
tax
and
it
would
be
illegal
to...
to
have
one
under
state
law.
okay,
now,
why
is
it
an
income
tax?
unknown
speaker
where
does
that
number
come
from?
unknown
speaker
well,
how
would
i
find
out
whether...
you
know,
i
see
a
big
list
of
occupations.
how
do
i
know...
how
am
i
supposed
to
find
that
out?
unknown
speaker
in
the
howard
case
that
you
rely
on,
were
there
categories
by
business
as...
as
your
ordinance
has
it?
unknown
speaker
so,
you
could
be
either
an
employee
in
sort
of
a
catchall
group
or
a
person
with
a
specific
business
and
you
had
to
pay
different
rates
according--
unknown
speaker
--to
your
business?
that...
that
was...
that
was
the...
the
pattern
of
ordinance
in
howard?
unknown
speaker
yours...
yours
doesn't
look
like
an
income
tax
because
it's...
it's
on
gross
receipts.
there
are
no
deductions.
but
that
was
also
true
of
the
howard
case.
unknown
speaker
and
the
buck
act
defines
income
tax
very
broadly,
doesn't
it?
unknown
speaker
it's
any
tax
levied
on
with
respect
to
or
measured
by
net
income,
gross
income,
or
gross
receipts.
unknown
speaker
but
don't
you
have
the
additional
problem,
your
license
fee
or
tax
or
whatever
it
is
is
arguably
discriminatory
under
davis
against
michigan?
unknown
speaker
all
the
people...
all
the
people
on
the
list
that
justice
breyer
referred
to
don't
pay
it.
unknown
speaker
the
architects,
barbers,
hair
dressers,
all
that
list.
unknown
speaker
and
they
do
not
pay
it.
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
the...
but
the
amount
that
is
paid
by
the
respective
people
in
the
different
jobs
is
quite
different
from
the
amount
the
judges
have
to
pay.
unknown
speaker
well,
they
all
are,
aren't
they?
unknown
speaker
they're
all
flat
fees,
aren't
they?
unknown
speaker
are
there
any
of
those
which
the
license
fee
is
as
high
as
the
income
tax
on
the
judges?
unknown
speaker
well,
you
know
what
federal
judges
make
and
you
know
what
the
license
fees
are.
i
was
under
the
impression
that
none
of
the
license
fees
were
as
high
as
the
tax
on
the
judge.
unknown
speaker
but
assuming
that's
true,
why...
how
then
do
you
get
around
davis
against
michigan?
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
that
wasn't
the
basis,
though,
of
the
eleventh
circuit's
decision
here,
was
it,
that
it
discriminated?
unknown
speaker
and
is
it
true,
mr.
sewell...
mr.
sewell,
is
it
true
that
this
tax
would
apply
to
state
court
judges
in
the
same
way
it
applies
to
federal
judges?
unknown
speaker
and
the
same
with
prosecutors.
unknown
speaker
so,
the
state
court
judges
are
taxed
on
their
income
in
the
same--
unknown
speaker
--prosecutors
are
not.
the
prosecutors
are
not.
unknown
speaker
so,
they
pay...
they
don't
pay
one-half
of
1
percent
of
their
income.
unknown
speaker
they
pay
$200
a
year
flat
or
something
like
that.
that
would
be
the
same
for
the
u.s.
attorney,
though,
wouldn't
it?
unknown
speaker
mr.
sewell--
unknown
speaker
--i
want
to
erase
a...
a
stupid
question
i
asked.
the
answer
to
my
question
about
the
supreme
court
in
deciding
this
case
would
be
violating
the
tax
injunction
act.
unfortunately,
the
act
was
not
reproduced
in
your
brief.
having
dug
it
out,
i
find
it
only
applies
to
district
courts,
doesn't
it?
unknown
speaker
that's
the
right
answer.
unknown
speaker
very
well,
mr.
sewell.
mr.
jones,
we'll
hear
from
you.
unknown
speaker
but
the
way
the
tax
is
designed
is
that
you
are...
it
is
illegal
to
engage
in
the
duties
unless
you
pay
the
tax.
you
don't
have
simply
a
financial
liability
for
the
tax.
unknown
speaker
there...
there
is
a
prohibition
to...
against
engaging
on
the
duties
themselves.
unknown
speaker
does
it
matter
at
all
that
under
state
law
the
county
is
prohibited
from
imposing
an
income
tax?
do
we
care
about
that?
unknown
speaker
they
can't
do
it.
it's
ultra
vires.
unknown
speaker
i
think
the
removal
argument
is
tangled
up
a
little
bit
with--
unknown
speaker
--some
judges
in
this
jurisdiction
have
paid
the
tax.
right?
and...
and
presumably
would
have
been
violating
their
duties
if...
if
resisting
the
tax
was
part
of
the
federal
responsibilities
of
these
people.
unknown
speaker
it
seems
to
me
a
federal
judge
could
have
taken
the
position
that
it
is
simply
unlawful
to
condition
under
state
law
my
performance
of
my
federal
powers
and
exercise
of
my
federal
responsibility.
and...
and
if
the
case
is
looked
at
that
way,
then
the...
the
removal
i
suppose
is
in
a
different
posture.
unknown
speaker
well,
here
the
judges
i
suppose
could
have
taken
the
position
that
the...
that
the
disposition
of
the
case
that
was
brought
was
simply
a...
a
predicate
to
what
could
have
been
an
injunction
against
their
performance
of
their...
their
federal
responsibilities.
unknown
speaker
why
not?
unknown
speaker
well,
it
provides
for
interest
and
penalties,
but
i
suppose
if
there
is
arguably
a
prohibition
against
the
exercise
of
the...
of
the
professional
responsibilities,
state
equity
would...
would
enforce
it.
unknown
speaker
well,
just...
just...
on...
on
that
point,
in...
this
district
has
multiple
locations.
if
the
chief
judge
of
the
district
says
you
must
come
to
birmingham
and
try
this
class
action
for
a
year
and
a
half,
the
judge
has
no
choice.
that's...
he's
exercising
his
official
duty.
unknown
speaker
doesn't
it
say
on...
the
language
of
it
is
it
is
called
a
license
fee
for
the
privilege
of
engaging
in
or
following
such
vocation
or
occupation.
it
doesn't...
it
says
in
the
statute
that
it's
for
the
privilege
of
engaging
in
the
vocation.
unknown
speaker
no.
the
objection
here
is
it
isn't
income
tax.
they
don't
even
measure
it
by
income.
they
measure
it
by
gross
receipts.
unknown
speaker
or
gross
receipts.
unknown
speaker
do
you
have
any
thoughts
on
the
merits?
unknown
speaker
mr.
jones,
if
we
should
agree
with
you
about
that
issue
on
the
merits,
what
about
the
issue
that
the
eleventh
circuit
didn't
decide
and
that
is
the
diminution
of
compensation?
would
we--
unknown
speaker
--mr.
jones,
i
don't
think
the
tax
in
michigan
discriminated
against
the
federal
workers
because
they
were
federal
workers.
it
just
treated
them
like
every
other
citizen
in
the
state,
discriminated
in
favor
of
a
very
small
group
of
state
workers.
unknown
speaker
i
did.
[laughter]
i
think
the
cases
are
quite
similar.
unknown
speaker
yes.
you're
not
asking
us
to
reexamine
davis,
though.
mr.
jones,
you've
repeated
several
times
about
your
reliance
on
o'malley
against
woodrough,
and
yet
it
isn't
cited
in
the
government's
brief.
could
you
file
a
citation
to
that
with
the
clerk?
unknown
speaker
thank
you,
mr.
jones.
mr.
morrison,
we'll
hear
from
you.
unknown
speaker
you
do
not
cite
decisions
that
are
only
2
years
old?
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
if
it
is,
it's
pretty
important
because
the
court
would
then
have
an
obligation
to
remand
on
its
own.
unknown
speaker
and
in
caterpillar,
that
was...
going
in,
that
was
recognized
that
this
court
should
have
remanded.
the
problem
was
we
were
at
the
end
of
the
line.
there
was
at
that
point
complete
diversity.
so,
it
was
a
very
practical
oriented
decision.
it
said
that
the
district
court
did
wrong
in
not
remanding.
it
should
have
done
that
in
the
beginning.
unknown
speaker
i
don't
follow
that
because
i
don't
think
the
tax
collector
in
alabama
could
originally
have
brought
this
case
in
federal
court.
not...
he...
he
has
no
federal
question
on
the
face
of
his
complaint.
there
is
no
diversity.
on
what
basis
could
it
come
into
federal
court
originally?
unknown
speaker
and
even
if
you're
wrong
about
that,
there's
enough...
it's
an
arguable--
unknown
speaker
--proposition--
unknown
speaker
--i...
i
don't
think
that's
confusing
jurisdiction
with
the
merits.
i
mean,
the...
the
question
of
whether,
in
making
this
claim,
your
clients
are
acting
pursuant
to
their
official
duties
has
nothing
to
do
with
the...
with
the
merits
of
the
case.
that
is
a
question
that
just
goes
to
the
jurisdiction.
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
well,
is
a
colorable
claim
enough?
unknown
speaker
what's
the
authority
for
that?
unknown
speaker
well,
if
you
don't
have
it
handy,
you
have
it
covered--
unknown
speaker
--you
cover
it
in
your
brief.
unknown
speaker
that's
the
merits
question.
yes,
i
think--
--that's
not...
that's
not
the
question
of...
of
whether
the
official
is
acting
in
official
capacity
in...
in
bringing
the
suit.
a
purely
jurisdictional--
unknown
speaker
--i
understand
the
chief
justice
to
be
asking
whether
it
is
enough
that
you
have
merely
a
colorable
claim
under
the
jurisdictional
provision.
unknown
speaker
i
thought
that's
what
he
was
asking.
unknown
speaker
okay.
you
have
to
establish--
unknown
speaker
--that,
period.
not
colorably
but--
unknown
speaker
--and
in
the
course
of
your
remarks,
please
present
them
as
you
wanted
to,
but
the
howard
case
stumps
me.
unknown
speaker
i...
i
just
don't
know
how
to
get
around
that.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
think
your
problem
isn't
so
much
the
howard
case
as
the
definition
in
the
buck
act
that
says
an
income
tax
is
any
tax
levied
on,
respect
to,
or
measured
by
net
income,
gross
income,
or
gross
receipts,
which
the
court
was
simply
interpreting
in
howard.
unknown
speaker
well,
whatever
it
may
be
principally,
do
you
dispute
the
fact
that
this...
this
tax
was
measured
by
either
gross
income
or
gross
receipts?
unknown
speaker
then
why...
why
doesn't
the
buck
act
cover
it
by
its
very
terms?
unknown
speaker
but
they're
also
totally
unrelated
to
the
source.
you're
not...
or
maybe
you
are...
making
an
equal
protection
case,
that
it's
arbitrary
to
let
the
barbers
pay
less
than
the
judges.
unknown
speaker
but
here
all
the
state
judges
are
in
the
same
boat.
the
u.s.
attorney
pays
the...
the
other
fee,
and
so
does
the
district...
local
district
attorney.
so,
there's
no
discrimination
between
like
groups.
unknown
speaker
we...
we
began
with
the
case
being
removed
because
you
have
a
federal
defense,
and
now,
all
of
a
sudden,
it's
discrimination
which
is--
--yes.
you
didn't
argue--
unknown
speaker
--but
was
that...
was
that
argument
passed
on
by
the
eleventh
circuit?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
yes,
and
did
you
file
a
cross
petition
for
certiorari?
unknown
speaker
so,
you're
asking
us
to
reverse
a
holding.
the
district
court
said
there
was
no
discrimination.
the
court
of
appeals
said
they
would
not
consider
that.
unknown
speaker
if
the
basis
for
your
removal
under
the
federal
part
of
the
removal
statute
fails,
shouldn't
the
district
court
simply
remand
to
the
state
court
to
hear
the
discrimination
issue?
it's
kind
of
like
a
pendent
issue
here.
unknown
speaker
in
other...
in
other
words,
if
your
business
privilege
tax
argument
falls
away,
which
was
the--
unknown
speaker
--on
the
merits,
which
was
the
basis
for
you
to
get
into
federal
court,
the
federal
court...
you
want
it
to
go
on
and
decide
the
discrimination
issue
on
the
grounds
that
it's
pendent
jurisdiction
here
at
issue?
unknown
speaker
mr.
morrison,
may
i
just
interrupt
you
there
because
1367,
the
supplemental
jurisdiction
provision,
applies
when
the
claim...
there
is
a
claim
within
the
original
jurisdiction
of
the
federal
court.
this
case,
whatever,
is
not
within
the
original
jurisdiction.
you
agreed
with
me
there
was
no
diversity.
the
suit
to
collect
is
not
based
on
federal
law.
it's
in
the
removal...
it's...
it's
removed
based
on
a
federal
defense.
and
there's
no
provision
for
original
entry
into
the
federal
court
based
on
a
federal
defense.
so,
supplemental
jurisdiction
i
think
would
not
apply
because
there
is
no
claim
here--
unknown
speaker
--over
which
the
federal
court
has
original
jurisdiction.
unknown
speaker
mr.
morrison,
we
have
held,
i
guess,
that
whether
the
tax
should
be
characterized
as
an
income
tax
is
a
matter
to
be
determined
on
federal
law.
unknown
speaker
and
in
making
the
federal
law
determination,
do
we
look
at
all
at
state
law
which
says
that
the
county
has
no
authority
to
levy
an
income
tax?
unknown
speaker
is
that
part
of
the
federal
law--
unknown
speaker
--calculus
or
not?
unknown
speaker
and
how
have
we
dealt
with
that?
unknown
speaker
was
this
not
argued
in...
in
the...
the
howard
case?
unknown
speaker
because
the
howard
case
applied
simply
to
area
discrimination.
unknown
speaker
why
does
the
buck
act
apply,
or...
or
does
it,
or
why
does
it
not
apply?
that
is,
the
buck
act,
the
court
said,
says
income
tax,
any
tax
measured
by
gross
receipts.
unknown
speaker
this
is
a
tax--
unknown
speaker
--measured
by
gross
receipts.
unknown
speaker
why
does
it
not
apply
here?
the
buck
act.
unknown
speaker
the
buck
act
says
it
applies
only
to
federal
enclaves.
unknown
speaker
this
is
not
a
federal
enclave.
am
i
right
about
that?
unknown
speaker
well,
couldn't
one
say
even
though
it
doesn't
strictly
apply,
congress
gave
a
definition
of
a
tax
on
income
there
and
it
didn't
have
a
different
one
in
the
public
salary
act?
so,
one
can
assume
that
acting
so
close
together,
what
they
said
about
what
constitutes
a
tax
on
income
in
the
one
case
also
applies
in
the
other.
unknown
speaker
if
it
were
called
a
professional
income
tax,
would
your
argument
be
any
different?
unknown
speaker
everything
is
the
same.
the
label
is
different.
unknown
speaker
but
the
county
has
to
say
that
because
of
an
impediment
under
state
law
that
it
can't
have
a,
quote,
income
tax.
unknown
speaker
but
you
don't
deny
that
something
can
be
a
tax
on
income
for
one
purpose
and
not
for
another.
unknown
speaker
well,
can't
the...
doesn't
the
state
also
speak
of
licensing
people
who
engage
in
certain
kinds
of
businesses
and
collect
a
sales
tax
from
them
based
on
gross
receipts?
most
states
do
i
think.
they
call
it
a
license
tax,
but
it's
simply
measured
by
gross
receipts
and
it's
a
sale
tax.
unknown
speaker
just
hypothetically,
what
if...
what
if
a
state
said
that,
you
know,
in
order
to
engage
in
the
following
businesses...
and
it
names
virtually
every
business...
you
need
a
license
and
the...
you're
going
to
have
to
pay
a
sales
tax
measured
by
gross
receipts?
that
would
be
an
income
tax
under
the
buck
act,
would
it
not?
unknown
speaker
no,
no.
unknown
speaker
just...
just
assume...
assume
it
applies
to...
to
anybody
who
engages
in
certain
kinds
of
businesses
that
produce
gross
receipts.
unknown
speaker
yes,
but...
that's
true
of
the
public
salary
act
too,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
but
it
seems
to
me
you're...
you're
trying
to
say
that
a
license
tax
is
something
quite
peculiar
to
just
certain
professions,
and
i
don't...
don't
think
it
is
at
all.
i
think--
unknown
speaker
--i
think
you
have
a
license
tax
in
most
places
to
engage
in
any
kind
of
business.
it's
called
a
sales
tax.
unknown
speaker
certainly
a
sales
tax
is
not
a
fixed
fee.
unknown
speaker
but
under
the
buck
act,
a
sales
tax
would
be
an
income
tax.
unknown
speaker
and
why
can't
they
do
that?
unknown
speaker
thank
you,
mr.
morrison.
mr.
sewell,
you
have
4
minutes
remaining.
unknown
speaker
mr.
sewell--
unknown
speaker
--what
about
the
argument
that
this
discriminates
against
federal
employees?
because
if
that
were
so,
there
would
be
a
case
here,
wouldn't
there?
unknown
speaker
the
point
on
discrimination
i
think
is
not...
one
point
is
that
it's
unlawful
because
of
that,
but
the
other
is
that
it
just...
it
helps
to
characterize
the
tax.
if
it
were
really
an
income
tax,
they
wouldn't
charge
lawyers
$250
flat
and
judges
depending
on
their
salary.
if
it
were
really
an
income
tax,
they'd
run
it
like
an
income
tax.
what's
your
response
to
that?
unknown
speaker
of
course,
holloway
was
decided
long
before
davis
against
michigan.
unknown
speaker
well,
was
federal
immunity
argued
other
than
the
fact
that
it
was
a
former
enclave?
unknown
speaker
maybe
that
question
almost
answers
itself.
it's
no
longer
an
enclave.
unknown
speaker
thank
you,
mr.
sewell.
