mr.
kent
l.
jones
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
tax
injunction
act
bars
only
anticipatory
relief
against
state
taxation
in
federal
courts.
as
justice
stone
said
for
this
court
in
matthews
v.
rodgers,
which
is
cited
in
the
legislative
history
of
the
tax
injunction
act,
although
injunctions
against
state
taxes
should
not
be
heard
in
federal
courts,
federal
courts
remain
competent
to
decide
questions
of
state
law,
and
therefore
can
adjudicate
collection
and
refund
cases
brought
in
federal
court
so
long
as
the
essential
elements
of
federal
jurisdiction
are
present.
it's
our
position
that
in
this
case,
the
essential
elements
of
federal
jurisdiction
are
not
present.
the
only
asserted
basis
for
federal
jurisdiction
is
the
federal
removal
statute
which
does
not
apply
here
because
the
action
of
the
judge
in
refusing
to
pay
a
tax
on
his
private
income
is
not
an
act
taken
under
color
of
authority
or
pursuant
to
his
duties
as
a
federal
officer.
in
the
removal
petition,
respondents
incorrectly
stated
that
the
tax
was
imposed
on
the
act
of
performing
their
official
duties.
that's
not
correct.
the
tax
is
imposed
on,
it's
calculated
on
and
assessed
on
their
earnings.
and
this
court
made
clear
in
the
o'malley
v.
woodrough
case
that
the
responsibility
of
federal
judges
to
pay
taxes
on
their
earnings
derives
from
their
private
responsibilities
as
citizens
and
that
they
have
the
same
responsibility
as
everyone
else
to
share
in
the
costs
of
paying
for
the
benefits
the
government
provides.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
i
don't--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--what
it
really
says
is
it's
unlawful
to
do
it
without
paying
the
tax,
and
then
you
have
to
see
what
that
means.
what
that
means
is
if
you
don't
pay
the
tax,
you
have
to
pay
interest
and
penalties.
there
are
no
other
enforcement
mechanisms
in
this
case.
we
would
have
a
vastly--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--not
on--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--well,
let's
go
right
to
the
merits.
i've
just
been
talking
about
jurisdiction.
but
on
the
merits,
no.
the
income--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--well,
it
shouldn't
be
because
the...
there
is
no
question
that
they...
they
need
to
show
a
colorable
federal
defense.
but
the
existence
of
a
colorable
federal
defense
doesn't
dispose
of
the
requirement
that
the
act
for
which
they
were
sued
be
one
that
they
took
in
their
official
capacities.
and
it's
our
position
that...
that
any
federal
officer
who
doesn't
pay
his
federal...
his
state
or
local
taxes
is
acting
in
a
private
capacity.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
i
just
don't
think
federal
duties
apply
in
any
direction
on...
on
the
private
decision
about
paying
your
tax
on
your
personal
income.
the
supreme
court
in...
in
o'malley
seems
to
me
to
have
made
that
point.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
if...
we
have...
in
deciding
whether
removal
is
proper,
you
have
to
look
at
what
case
was
brought
in
state
court.
if
there
were
a
case
brought
in
state
court
that
said
that
this
judge
should
be
enjoined
or
should
be
prevented
from
performing
his
official
functions,
then
the
judge
could
remove
the
case
and
say
that
what's
at
issue
is
my
official
acts,
whether
i
can
perform
my
official
function.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
well,
i
don't
think
it
is
a
predicate
to
an
injunction.
i
don't
think
and
none
of
the
courts
below
thought
that
an
injunction
could
possibly
be
issued.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
well,
if
for
no
other
reasons,
inequity
wouldn't...
the
legal
remedy
of
collecting
the
tax
is
sufficient,
but
beyond
that,
what
this
tax
says
is
what's
unlawful...
what
happens
when
it's
unlawful
and
the
tax
isn't
paid
is
interest
and
penalties.
it
doesn't
say
anything
beyond
that.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
if
this...
again,
if
the
state...
if
the
suit
in
state
court
arose
in
connection
with
that
act,
that
would
be
the
act
at
issue
in
the
removal.
the
act
at
issue
in
this
case
was
paying
the
tax
and
that
was
a
private
act,
not
an
official
act.
on
the
merits--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--that
may
well
be
and
it
may
well
be
true
too
that
when
a
federal
judge
goes
to
different
states...
i
mean,
an
appellate
judge
goes
to
different
states,
he
might
become
subject
to
their
taxes
also.
on
the
merits--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--the...
this
issue
is
already
well
plowed
in
this
court's
cases.
in
howard
v.
county
commissioner,
the
court
upheld
a
similar
business
privilege
tax
against
the
very
objection
that
the
tax
was
an
improper
license
fee
on
federal
workers.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
well,
the
tax
doesn't
have
to
be
an
income
tax
to
be
valid.
the
public
salary
tax
act
authorizes
a
tax
on
pay
or
compensation.
the
buck
act
authorizes
a
tax
on...
authorizes
an
income
tax
but
defines
that
by
statute
to
mean
any
tax
on
income.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
yes,
and...
well,
income
as
used
in
the
broadest
sense,
as
near
as
we
can
tell
from
looking
at
that
statute.
and
this
court
has
defined
that
term
to
mean
any
accretion
to
wealth.
so,
this
tax
doesn't
have
to
be
a
federal
income
tax
or
a
state
income
tax.
it
has
to
be
a
tax
on
income,
which
it
is.
and
in...
in
howard
v.
commissioner,
the
court
said
the
fact
that
the
tax
is
described
is
in
the
form
of
or
labeled
as
a
license
fee
doesn't
make
it
invalid.
what
is...
what
matters
is
that
it's
practical
operation
is
to
tax
the
income
of
federal
officers.
if
in
its
practical
operation
it
taxes
their
income,
it
is
valid
regardless
of
the
form
or
label
applied.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
that's
what
i
was
kind
of
working
on
there,
justice
scalia.
[laughter]
the
only
other
thought
i
have
on
the
merits
is
that
their
contention
that
discrimination
prohibits
this
tax
is
simply
wrong.
in
davis
v.
michigan,
the
kind
of
discrimination
the
public
salary
tax
act
prohibits
is
discrimination
based
on
the
sovereignty
of
the
employees.
this
is
not
like
the
pension
discrimination
involved
in
davis
v.
michigan
where
state
workers
were
treated
better
than
federal
workers.
under
this
tax
scheme,
it
appears
that
regardless
of
whether
you're
a
federal
worker,
a
state
worker,
a
private
worker,
the
tax
applies
the
same
way
to
you.
it's
true
that
there
are
exemptions
in
the
state...
in
the
county
tax
provision
for
undertakers
and
barbers,
for
people
who
are
already
licensed
under
the
state
licensing
scheme,
and
the
evident
purpose
of
those
objections
is
to
avoid
a
double
tax
on
these
previously
licensed
professions.
those
kinds
of
equalizing
adjustments
don't
discriminate
on
the
basis
of
sovereignty.
they
apply
equally
and
this
case
does
not
present
any
question
about
equal
protection
issues
whether
these
kinds
of
discriminations
satisfy
the
rational
basis
standard
because
those
issues
weren't
raised
below.
the
only
discrimination
issue
involved
under
the
buck
act
is...
under
the
public
salary
tax
act
is
whether
the
statute
discriminates
because
these
are
federal
workers,
and
the
answer
to
that
is
not.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
well,
the
o'malley
v.
woodrough,
the
court
held
that...
that
a
tax
on
the
incomes
of
federal
judges
would
not
be
a
diminishment
of
their
compensation
for
article
iii
purposes.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
it
did
discriminate
on
the
basis
of
sovereignty,
though,
and
i
believe
you
dissented
in
this
case.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
it's
the
majority's
view
is
what
i
was
trying
to
describe.
[laughter]
mr.
kent
l.
jones
it's
certainly
cited,
if
not
in
our
brief,
in
one
of
the
briefs.
but
i
will...
i'll
provide
you
with
the
citation,
and...
and
perhaps
mr.
sewell
can
give
it
to
you
in
his
reply.
