v.
acker,
no.
98-10.
this
case
concerns
an
occupational
tax
jefferson
county,
alabama
imposes
on
pay
for
work
performed
in
the
county.
does
federal
law
permit
the
county
to
impose
the
tax
on
federal
judges?
that
is
the
question
on
the
merits.
our
answer
is
yes,
but
we
reach
that
question
only
after
resolving
two
threshold
issues:
first,
do
the
federal
judges
properly
remove
the
county’s
tax
collection
actions
from
state
court
to
federal
court;
and
second,
did
the
tax
injunction
act
skip
the
federal
courts
of
authority
to
decide
the
case.
a
jefferson
county
ordinance
imposes
a
license
or
privilege
tax
on
those
who
work
within
the
county
and
do
not
otherwise
pay
a
license
fee
to
the
state
or
county.
the
ordinance
declarers
it
unlawful
to
engage
in
a
covered
occupation
without
paying
the
tax.
respondents
two
federal
judges
with
their
principal
offices
in
jefferson
county
resisted
payment
on
the
ground
that
the
tax
violates
the
immunity
of
one
sovereign
in
this
case,
the
federal
government,
from
taxation
by
the
other
in
the
state
of
alabama
which
authorize
jefferson
county
to
impose
the
tax.
the
doctrine
invoked
by
the
federal
judges
is
known
as
the
intergovernmental
tax
immunity
doctrine.
to
collect
the
tax,
jefferson
county
sued
the
federal
judges
in
an
alabama
small
claims
court.
the
judges
removed
the
collection
suits
to
the
federal
district
court.
in
the
decision
on
review
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
eleventh
circuit,
sitting
en
banc
held
that
the
suits
were
properly
removed,
that
the
tax
injunction
act
does
not
bar
federal
court
adjudication
in
this
case,
and
on
the
merits,
the
eleventh
circuit
held
that
jefferson
county’s
tax
violates
the
intergovernmental
tax
immunity
doctrine
to
the
extent
that
the
tax
which
is
a
compensation
of
federal
judges.
we
agree
with
the
eleventh
circuit’s
jurisdictional
conclusions,
but
we
reverse
on
the
merits.
the
federal
officer
removal
statute
allows
an
officer
of
the
federal
court
to
remove
the
case
from
state
court.
if
the
officer
raises
a
colorable
federal
defense
and
establishes
that
the
suit
is
for
an
act
under
color
of
office.
we
hold
for
reason
stated
in
the
opinion
that
the
judges
have
satisfied
those
requirements.
turning
to
the
next
preliminary
question,
the
tax
injunction
act,
an
act
that
bars
federal
court’s
from
enjoining,
suspending
or
restraining
the
collection
of
a
tax,
if
there
is
an
adequate
state
court
remedy.
that
provision
bars
a
taxpayer
from
seeking
anticipatory
relief
that
is
from
suing
a
state
or
county
to
stop
the
imposition
of
the
tax
or
to
gain
a
declaration
that
the
tax
is
invalid.
but
the
tax
injunction
act
does
not
stop
a
state
from
suing
to
collect
a
tax
nor
does
it
stop
a
taxpayer
from
urging
defensively
in
such
a
suit
that
the
tax,
for
which
the
collection
is
sought,
is
invalid.
the
eleventh
circuit’s
ruling
which
bares
several
judges
pay
from
jefferson
county’s
tax
extends
the
intergovernmental
immunity
doctrine,
beyond
the
tight
limits
of
this
court’s
decisions
and
most
notably,
the
court
of
appeals'
judgment,
striking
down
the
tax
is
inconsistent
with
the
controlling
federal
statute.
the
once
expansive
intergovernmental
tax
immunity
doctrine
was
reigned
in
by
this
court
and
by
congress
in
1938
and
1939.
as
applicable
here
the
essential
rule
is
that
the
sovereign
itself
cannot
be
taxed,
but
the
pay
of
government
officers
and
employees,
state,
federal
and
local
can
be
taxed
as
long
as
the
taxing
authority
does
not
discriminate
on
the
basis
of
the
source
of
the
pay.
for
example,
it
would
be
impermissible
for
a
state
or
county
to
tax
the
pay
of
federal
judges,
if
the
pay
of
state
judges
were
not
equally
taxed.
the
judges
argued
that
jefferson
county
has
imposed
not
an
income
tax,
would
say
acknowledge
would
be
permissible,
but
a
licensing
scheme,
which
they
maintain
is
impermissible.
the
ordinance
pay
point
that
declares
it
unlawful
to
engage
in
a
covered
occupation
without
paying
the
license
fee.
we
reject
that
argument,
although
jefferson
county
may
have
chosen
the
words
of
the
ordinance
incautiously.
in
reality
the
county
has
installed
no
regulatory
scheme,
it
is
simply
taxing
judges
pay.
jefferson
county
neither
issues
licenses
to
taxpayers
nor
in
anyway
endeavors
to
regulate
them
in
the
performance
of
their
duties
based
on
their
status
as
licensed
taxpayers
and
the
county
has
not
been
so
bold
as
to
demand
that
the
judges
stop
working
in
federal
court
until
by
paying
the
tax,
they
receive
lawful
permission
to
do
their
federal
job.
in
response
to
the
judge’s
refusal
to
pay
the
tax,
jefferson
county
has
simply
instituted
a
collection
suit.
congress
has
commanded
that
state
taxation
of
the
pay
of
federal
employees
must
not
discriminate
because
of
the
federal
cost
of
the
payroll
compensation.
jefferson
county,
we
hold,
honors
that
command,
the
tax
which
is
paid
by
all
state
judges
in
the
county
does
not
discriminate
against
federal
judges,
in
particular
or
federal
officeholders
in
general.
justice
scalia
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
part
and
dissenting
in
part
in
which
the
chief
justice,
justice
souter
and
justice
thomas
have
joined;
justice
breyer
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
part
and
dissenting
in
part
in
which
justice
o’connor
has
joined.
that
sounds
complicated
but
it
was
down
to
this.
on
removability
of
the
action
from
state
court
to
federal
court
we
divide
five
to
four.
chief
justice,
justice
scalia,
justice
souter
and
justice
thomas
withhold
the
collection
actions
not
removable
from
state
court,
but
having
lost
on
that
issue
they
have
joined
the
court
on
the
remaining
issues.
we
are
unanimous
that
the
tax
injunction
act
does
not
stop
the
case
from
proceeding
in
federal
court
and
on
the
merits
seven
justices
agree
that
the
county’s
tax
maybe
imposed
on
federal
and
state
judges.
alike
two
justices,
justice
o’connor
and
justice
breyer,
in
an
opinion
by
justice
breyer
conclude
that
the
intergovernmental
tax
immunity
doctrine
shields
the
federal
judges
from
jefferson
county's
tax.
