mr.
alan
b.
morrison
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
before
turning
to
the
merits,
i
want
to
deal
with
the
justiciability
tax
injunction
act
issue
and
the
removal
which
are
all
kind
of
tied
together
in
our
view.
this
case
was
removed
from
the
small
claims
division
of
the
state
court
of
alabama
by
the
respondents,
two
article
iii
federal
judges,
and
they
alleged
in
their
removal
petition
that
the
provision
that
the...
both
the
justice
kennedy
and
justice
souter
focused
on
about
the
unlawful...
making
it
unlawful
to
engage
in
the
occupation
was
tantamount
to
an
imposition
of
a
licensing
requirement
by
the
county
upon
federal
judges,
which
if
carried
out,
would
interfere
with
their
federal...
carrying
on
the
duties
of
federal
judges.
for
purposes
of
removal,
that
is
clearly
a
kind
of
federal
immunity
defense,
saying
that
the
constitution
does
not
allow
jefferson
county
to
do
that.
if
ultimately
we
are
wrong
on
the
merits...
and
i'll
try
to
explain
why
we
don't
think
we
are...
that
would
not
have
allowed
us...
that
would
not
defeat
the
removal.
but
significantly
for
removal
i
want
to
point
out
that
at
no
time
did
jefferson
county
in
the
district
court
or
in
the
court
of
appeals
suggest
that
removal
was
improper.
and
the
rules...
the
statute
requires
that
removal
be
objected
to
within
30
days
or
at
least
by
the...
if
you
allege
that
this
is
subject
matter
jurisdiction,
which
i'm
not
sure
whether
it
is
or
not,
that
has
to
be
done
by
the
time
of
final
judgment.
so,
even
this
court's
decision
in
the
caterpillar
case...
mr.
chief
justice,
i
do
not
cite
that
in
my
brief,
but
it
was
a
recent
decision
a
couple
of
years
ago...
allowing
these
removal
issues
to
be
raised
later--
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
--your
honor,
i...
i
didn't
think
of
it
until
i
saw
what
their
reply
brief
said,
and
that...
i
wasn't
sure
that
it
was
going
to
come
up
until
i
was
actually
preparing
for
my
argument
today.
in
any
event,
i'm
not
sure
whether
it's
jurisdictional
or
not,
but
in
any
event,
it
was
never
raised
and
we
think
it's--
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
--that
is
correct.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
but
in
this
case
they
were
never
asked
to
remand
on
the
grounds
of
1442(a)(3).
the
provision
that
allows
officers
of
the
courts
of
the
united
states
to
remove
should
not
have
been
invoked.
the
only
basis
for
saying
that
the
case
was
not
properly
in
federal
court
was
the
provision
of
the
tax
injunction
act,
and
that
was
what
the
petitioner
relied
upon.
in
any
event--
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
--i
think
that's
correct,
your
honor.
it
could
not
have
come
into
federal
court
originally.
but
i
believe
that
the...
the...
under
1442(a)(3),
we
must
have
a
colorable
federal
immunity
claim.
as
i've
explained,
we
have
a
colorable
federal
immunity
claim
in
this
case
because
we
claim
that
the
license
fee
is
tantamount
to
a
licensing
requirement
which
would
interfere
with
our
federal...
our
federal
duties
as
article
iii
judges,
if
that
was
imposed.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
yes.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
and
as
this
court
has
said
on
many
occasions,
the...
one
should
not
confuse
the
issue
of
jurisdiction
with
the
issue
of
the
merits,
and
that...
and
that
so
long
as
we
have
a
colorable
federal
immunity
defense,
we
would...
we
would
be
able
to
be
in
court.
now,
if
our
only
claim
were,
however,
that
the
tax
was
unduly
discriminatory...
that
is
to
say,
it
violated
the...
the
public
salary
tax
act...
and
that
it
was
not
a
license
of
any
kind,
we
might
be
in
a
different
situation
then.
in
any
event--
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
--well,
i
agree
with
that,
your
honor.
i
was...
the...
the
government
has
made
a
great
deal
of
saying
that
we...
that
this
is
not
in
fact
a
license
fee
and
therefore
we
lose.
and
that
may
be
right
on
the
merits.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
but...
but
it
is...
it
doesn't
defeat
our
jurisdiction.
and
i
think
one
ought
to
take
a
practical
construction
of
the
statute,
and
the
question
is
did
congress
intend
to
allow
article
iii
judges,
who
are
the
principal
persons
covered
by
1442(a)(3),
when
they
are
sued
and
they
believe
that
the
suit
involves
matters
directly
relating
to
their
official
functions.
they
raise
a
claim
of
federal
immunity,
whether
they
have
the
right
to
have
that
case
heard
in
the
federal
courts
or,
nonetheless,
have
to
have
it
heard
in
the
state
courts.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
yes,
it
is,
your
honor.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
willingham
and
i
believe
that
mesa
against
california
also
is.
the
willingham
case
is...
is--
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
--i
have--
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
--yes,
on
page
25.
also,
jamison...
jamison
against
willy
from
the
fourth
circuit,
mesa
against
california,
and
moe
against
the
salish
and
kootenai
tribes,
as
well
as
the
willingham
case,
all
stand
for
the
proposition
that
on
issues
of...
of
removal,
as
long
as
the
colorable
federal
defense
of
a
federal
immunity
applies,
it
is...
it
is
sufficient.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
well--
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
--oh,
i'm
sorry.
i
did
not
understand
your
question,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
the
question
is...
as
i
understand
it,
there's
no
question
that
these
persons
are
covered
persons
by
1442(a)(3).
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
we
have--
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
--period
and
they
are.
they
are
officers
of...
of
the
courts.
all
right.
that's
point
number
one.
point
two
is,
is
the
claim
that
they
are
raising...
are
they
raising
a
federal
immunity
defense
and
their
claim
of
federal
immunity
defense
must
not
be
proven
but
must
be
colorable.
and
their
federal
immunity
defense
is
that
the
county
is
trying
to
license
them.
it
is
not
imposing
an
income
tax.
it
is
trying
to
license
them,
and
by
trying
to
license
them,
just
as
much
as
if
they
tried
to
get
an
injunction
against
them,
if
the
end
in
this
case
would
say
they
must
submit
to
the
licensing
scheme,
which
we
contend
is
unconstitutional,
then
we
have
a
federal
immunity
not
to
be
part
of
that
licensing
scheme.
and
that
is
the
basis
of
our
federal
defense
on
which
1442(a)(3)
says
that
we
must
have
one
in
order
to
be
able
to
get
into
the
federal...
federal
courts.
and
the
congress
has
said
in
those
circumstances,
federal
judges
should
be
entitled
to
have
federal
cases
litigated
in
federal
courts
before
article
iii
judges
instead
of
the
state
courts
in
which
the
action
happens
to
be
brought.
now,
i
want
to
turn
now
to
the
merits
of
this
case
which
i
believe
turns
on
the
proper
characterization
of
the
ordinance.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
well,
let
me--
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
--well,
let
me...
let
me
begin
with
howard
since
it
has
taken
up
some
attention.
the
first
thing
i
think
we
ought
to
recognize
is
that
the
howard
ordinance,
insofar
as
it
was
before
the
court,
was
only...
the
single
footnote
in
note
2
in
the
howard
opinion
quotes
all
of
the
ordinance
that
was
actually
in
this
court.
i
have
gone
and
looked
at
the
joint
appendix,
and
there
is
nothing
about
exemptions
in
the
howard
ordinance
at
all.
so
that
insofar
as
the
court
was
aware,
and
despite
whatever
may
have
been
the
actual
state
of
the
law
at
the
time
in
terms
of
louisville
ordinance,
there
were
no
exemptions.
it
now
appears...
and
there
has
been
several
rounds
of
submissions
on
this,
but
it
appears
that
the
louisville
ordinance
in
effect
at
that
time
did
have
three
exemptions.
one
for
domestic
servants
and
the
ordinance
specifically
says
with
respect
to
that
that
the...
the
exemption
is
because
of
the
great
costs
of
administration
and
difficulty
of
collection
involved,
domestic
servants
are
excluded.
second,
there
is
an
exclusion
for
ministers.
i
don't
want
to
get
into
another
constitutional
issue
here
today,
but
whatever
that
exclusion
is
and
the
questionable
nature
of
it
under
first
amendment
law,
it
was
not
a
broad
exclusion.
the
other
exclusion
was
for
insurance
companies
who
had
other
taxes,
and
there
was
another
provision
that
said
other
businesses
that
had
licenses.
they
didn't
lose
their
licenses,
but
they
still
had
to
pay
the
tax
under
the
ordinance.
stated
another
way,
instead
of
the
140
exemptions
across
a
broad
range
of
issues
that
we
have
in
this
statutory
scheme
here,
we
had
a
very
narrow
set
of
exemptions,
one
for
obvious
administrative
convenience
reasons.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
well,
i
want
to
be
clear.
the
fact
that
this
is
not
an
income
tax
like
the
federal
income
tax
is
not
the
reason
that
we
say
that
this
is
not
a
tax
covered
by...
by
the
statute.
second
point.
the
buck
act
is
principally
a
provision
to
remove
the
possibility
that
someone
would
claim,
well,
you
cannot
tax
someone
because
you're
working
on
a
federal
enclave.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
i
do
not,
your
honor.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
the
buck
act
is
not
an
enabling
provision.
the
public
salary
tax
act
is
an
enabling
provision.
the
buck
act,
which
was
passed
2
years
subsequent
to
that,
was
a
provision
intended
to
close
a
possible
loophole.
that
the
argument
is
that
even
though
in
this...
in
the
case
of
louisville,
the
ordinance
there
was
physically
within
the
confines
of
the
city
of
louisville.
it
was
actually...
the
property
was
actually
owned
by
the
united
states,
and
the
concern
was
that
someone
would
say,
as
someone
did
in
that
case...
and
that
was
the
principal
focus
of
the
issue.
in
that
case,
the...
the
united
states
government
has
right
to
the
property
and
therefore
no
locality
may
impose
the
tax.
the
buck
act
didn't
impose
any
tax
or
authorize
it.
it
removed
an
impediment.
indeed,
those
are
i
think
the
words
in
the...
in
the
howard
opinion
itself.
but
even
if
this
is
an...
and
then
that
gets
me
to
my
next
question
which
is
while
one
might
think
of
this
as
a...
as
a
tax
on
pay
or
compensation,
that
we
believe
that
the
fact
that
there
are
these
massive
exemptions,
exemptions
which
are
totally
unrelated
to
income--
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
--i
am
not
making
an
equal
protection
argument.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
well,
i
want
to...
i
want
to
take
on
the...
the
direct
thrust
of
your
question,
but
first
i
want
to
make
what
i
believe
is
a...
is
a...
a
clarification.
if
you
are
a
lawyer
working
for
the
federal
government
and
you
are
assigned
to
go
to
alabama
to
be
an
assistant
u.s.
attorney
or
work
in
the
small
business
administration
of
the
internal
revenue
service,
you
may
have
to
be
a
lawyer,
but
you
don't
have
to
be
admitted
to
the
bar
of
the
state
of
alabama.
you
must
be
a
lawyer
someplace,
and
the
same
i
believe
is
true
for
doctors
and
others.
you
must
have
a
law
license,
but
alabama
can't
say
that
you
must
have
an
alabama
law
license
to
engage
in
legal
activities
in
alabama.
that's
up
to
the
lawyers.
all
right.
leaving
that
aside,
when
one
looks
at
the
statute
initially,
the
discrimination
as
to
source,
one
could
believe
that
since
federal
judges
pay
and
state
judges
pay,
it's
the
same.
i
do
not
believe
that
this
court's
decision
in
davis
against
michigan
allows
that
kind
of
construction.
that
was
the
very
argument
that
was
made
there,
that
there
was
only
a
narrow
group
of...
of
discrimination
there.
the
court
said...
and
justice
stevens
is
perfectly
aware
of
this
because
he
wrote
the
dissent
there.
he
said
the
court
has
adopted,
in
effect,
a
most
favored
nation
provision
under
which
if
federal
employees
are
treated
worse
than
state
employees,
then
that
is
the
proscribed
discrimination,
different
from
an
equal
protection
discrimination.
and
the
court,
8
to
1,
said
that
that
is
entirely
correct.
that
is,
in
essence,
what
we
have
here,
that
there
are
140
occupations
in
the
state
of
alabama
who
pay
license
fees
which
are
not
calculated
on
income.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
we
have
two
claims.
we
have
a
first
claim
that
it's
a...
there
are
two
separate
but
related
claims
based
on
the
exemption.
one
is
that
the
exemptions
destroy
the
essential
licensing
aspect...
destroy
the
income
tax
aspect.
that
is,
they
turn
it
into
a
licensing
scheme.
it
is
what
it
says
it
is.
it's
an
attempt
to
license,
and
it's
not
a
tax
on
pay
or
compensation
of
the
kind
envisioned
in
the
public
salary
tax
act.
that
is
our
first
argument.
that
is
the
argument
that
gets
us
into
the
federal
court
under
1442(a)(3).
our
second
argument...
and
i
would
agree
this
would
not
get
us
into
the
federal
court.
i
believe
i
said
that
earlier...
is
if
it
is
an
income
tax,
there
was
no
question
about
it
being
an
income
tax,
there
were
none
of
the...
of
the
evidences
such
as
the
language
making
it
unlawful
to
engage
in
our
profession,
the
language
calling
it
a
privilege
tax,
calling
these
license
fees,
we
would
still
have
a
discrimination
argument
based
on
davis.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
they
said
there
was
no
discrimination,
your
honor.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
the
argument
based
on
davis
was
not.
i
was
not
counsel
of
record
then.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
no.
i
don't
believe
i
have
to,
your
honor.
i
believe
that
so
long
as
i'm
asking
for
the
same
judgment,
which
is
that
the
tax
is
declared
unlawful,
that
i
do
not
have
to
file
a
cross
petition.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
your
honor,
i'm
asking
you
to
affirm
the
judgment.
you
could
do
it
on
either
of
two
grounds:
that
it's
a
license,
in
which
case
we're
affirming
exactly
what
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
said;
or
in
the
alternative,
that
it's
an
unjust
discrimination.
and
either
of
those
grounds
would
result
in
the
identical
judgment
of
the
district
court
and
of
the
en
banc
court
of
appeals,
although--
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
--if
the--
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
--on
the
merits.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
yes,
i
would
say
that
would
be
correct,
your
honor.
and
under
28
u.s.c.
1367,
the
supplemental
jurisdiction
provision,
which...
since
this
question
had
not
been
presented,
i
didn't...
i
didn't
note
it...
allows
for
pendent
jurisdiction
for
claims
arising
out
of
the
same
transaction
or
occurrence.
i
believe
it's
case
or
controversy.
the
terms
actually
are
there.
so
long
as...
as
there
are
no
additional
facts.
and
in
the
case
of
federal
questions,
which
this
would
be...
this
is
not
even...
indeed,
it's
not
even
a
different
claim.
it's
a
different
defense
to
the
same
claim
raised
by
the
state
given
the
purpose
to
promote
economy
and
the
fact
that
we
are
here
and
everybody
has
briefed
this
issue.
there's
no
facts
in
dispute.
there's
no--
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
--well--
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
--i
believe
it
attained
original
jurisdiction
if
the
removal
was
proper
in
the
first
instance.
but
in
any
event,
1367...
and
i
was
thinking
on
my
feet
a
little
bit...
principally
relates
to
additional
claims,
not
to
additional
defenses.
and
what
we
have
here
is
an
additional
defense
by
the
judges,
the
discrimination
as
opposed
to
the
license
defense.
and
given
that
the
common
nucleus
of
the
operative
facts,
there
would
be
no
reason
not
to
decide
this...
this
question.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
that
is
correct.
howard
so
held
that.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
i--
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
--it
is
certainly--
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
--it
is
part
of
it.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
well,
i
think
you've
dealt
with
it
in
the
context
of
looking
at
the
statute
as
a
whole
which
includes
both
the
fact
that
the...
the
state
forbids
the
collection
of
income
tax,
the
fact
that
this
is
designated
a
license
fee,
that
it's
an
occupational
license
tax
for
the
privilege
of
engaging
in
the
business.
but
the
court
has
made
it
clear
that
the
labels
are
certainly
not
controlling.
they
are
some...
some
assistance
to
the
court
in
trying
to
understand...
and
i
think
i
would
put
it
this
way.
when
congress
in
1937
passed
the
public
salary
tax
act,
it
permitted
states
and
localities
to
tax
pay
or
compensation.
and
what
we
are
trying
to
do
here
is
to
understand
the
meaning
of
that
term.
obviously,
the
pay
and
compensation
tax
does
not
have
to
be
a
mirror
image
of
the
federal
income
tax
in
whatever
iteration
we're
talking
about,
1937
or
1997.
it
must
be
a
tax
related
to...
a
tax,
for
instance,
on
wages
alone
that
didn't
tax
passive
income
would
be
perfectly
acceptable.
or
conversely,
a
tax
on
passive
income
would
be...
would
be
acceptable.
there
could
be
deductions
allowed.
they
could
be
the
same
as
federal.
they
could
be
different.
all
of
that
would
be
a
tax
on
pay
and
compensation.
the
question
is,
does
a
scheme
like
this
one
in
which
there
are
massive
exemptions
for
persons
whose
exemptions
are
not
based
on
anything
related
to
pay
or
compensation...
they
are
based
upon
a
fixed
license
fee
paid
to
the
state
in
an
amounts
that
range
from
$2.50
in
fixed
amounts
up
to
$250
or
$500.
but
regardless
of
what
those
amounts
were--
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
--no,
your
honor.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
yes.
it
was
a...
it
was
a
geographic
fight.
the
principal
issue
in
howard
was
whether
a
complicated
annexation
by
the
united
states
and
then
giving
back
to
the
city
of
louisville
had
somehow
made
this
no
longer
part
of
the
city
of
louisville,
and
that
was
the
first
issue
the
court
dealt
with.
the
opinion
is
only
six
pages.
the
second
part
was
whether
the
buck
act
applied
and
whether
this
was
the
kind
of
federal
enclave
that
permitted
it.
there
was
no
question
in
the
majority
opinion
as
to
whether
this
was
an
income
tax.
mr.
justice
douglass,
mr.
justice
black
in
their
dissent
said,
i
find
it
hard
to
understand
how
there
can
be
an
income
tax
under
federal
law
that's
not
an
income
tax
under
state
law.
and
our
answer
to
that
is,
all
right,
we
accept
that
proposition.
the
label
alone
doesn't
control
it,
but
with
that
plus
all
of
the
remaining
indicia,
we
think
that
this
is
not
the
kind
of
tax
that
congress
said
that
federal
employees
should
have
to
pay
when
they
cannot
get
an
exemption.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
well--
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
--that
definition--
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
--that
definition,
justice
breyer,
applies
only
to
the
buck
act.
the
buck
act
is
sections
106
through
110
of
title
4.
the
public
salary
tax
act,
which
is
the
authorizing
provision
for
taxation
here,
is
in
section
111,
and
the
definition
does
not
apply
to
that.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
the
buck
act
is
not
an
authorizing
provision.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
it--
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
--well,
i
don't
know
whether
the
federal
courthouse
is
a
federal
enclave,
your
honor.
i
think
the
court
has
not
decided
that.
but
what
the
buck
act
does...
and
i'll
read
the
language,
and
this
is
in
the
appendix
to
the
petition
for
certiorari
at
page
119.
it
says,
no
person
shall
be
relieved
from
liability
on...
by
reason
of
his
residing
within
a
federal
area
or...
or
receiving
income
from
an
area
in
a
federal
enclave,
to
paraphrase.
it
is
a
relieving...
it's
a
loophole
closing
provision.
the
public
salary
tax
act
is
the
imposition
or
the
authorizing
provision,
the
consent
or,
as
the
history
of
the
act
makes
clear,
it
is
confirming
that
which
this
court
had
decided
just
a
few
years
ago,
just
immediately
preceding
it
in
the
graves
case,
that
the
constitution
did
not
present
any
independent
barriers.
and
they
wanted
to
be
sure
that
there
was
never
any
backsliding.
so,
the
buck
act
in
itself
doesn't
give
them
any
authority
to
impose
anything.
it
simply
says,
by
the
way,
these
two
possible
exceptions
do
not
apply
in
this
case.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
they
certainly
could,
your
honor.
and
we
do
not
suggest
that
simply
because
this
is
a
gross
receipts
tax
in
and
of
itself,
it
loses
its
character
as
an
income
tax,
and
the
tax
is
impermissible.
it's
the
fact
that
it's
a
gross
receipts
tax
and
there
are
these
massive
exemptions
and
there
are
the
provisions
making
it
a
license
fee--
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
--based
on
the
exemptions,
no,
it
wouldn't,
your
honor.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
it
would
be
a
little
bit
less
of
an
indication
that
this
is
a
licensing
scheme
which
is,
after
all,
what
the
state
says
it
is,
but
it
wouldn't
be
dispositive.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
well--
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
--i
do
not
deny
that
at
all,
your
honor,
and
i
wanted
to
be
clear.
i
hope
i
was
clear
about
that.
we
recognize
that
the
county
and
the
state
may
properly
take
into
account
the
fact
that
persons
who
are
licensed
by
the
state
and
pay
fees...
in
the
case
of
lawyers,
a
considerable
fee;
in
case
of
most
other
professions,
a
quite
modest
fee
in
alabama...
that
all
of
those
persons
have...
the
state
could
properly
take
the
payment
of
those
fees
into
account.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
well,
that
is
in
addition
to
all
the
taxes
that
are
at
issue
here,
and
that
i
don't
think...
whatever
the
state
sales
tax
is,
it
doesn't...
as
far
as
i
am
aware,
doesn't
distinguish
between
persons
who
are
licensed
under
these
140--
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
--it...
i'm
trying
to
think
how
it
applies
to
federal
employees
or
federal
judges.
i
assume
that
nobody
is
going
to
talk
about
them
paying
taxes
on
their
opinions--
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
--that
they
issue.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
well,
the
buck
act,
of
course,
doesn't
talk
about
how
states
and
localities
can
do
it.
it
only
applies...
the
buck
act
only
applies
when
there
are
federal
officers
or
employees
involved.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
yes.
they're
both
limited
to
federal
employees,
your
honor.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
oh,
i
didn't
mean
to
say
that.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
well,
most
of
them
are
fixed
fees.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
of
course,
not.
but
the
public
salary
tax
act
doesn't
talk
about
sales
taxes
at
all.
it's
clear
that
that's
measured
on
income.
now,
there--
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
--a
gross...
a
gross
receipts
tax.
for
instance,
the
court
reporter
in
the
city
of
pittsburgh
case
sold
transcripts.
we
have
no
question
about
the
fact
that
the
transcripts
that
were
sold
to
the
public
are
properly
taxable
under
the
public
salary
tax
act,
and
that's
in
large
part
because
it's
not
a
licensing
scheme
in
any
way
and
also
because
there
are
no
exemptions
for
other
kinds
of
reporters
and
others
in
similar
situations,
no
arguable
discrimination.
in
any
event,
we...
we
are
confident
that
the
state
of
alabama
can
construct
a
licensing
tax
scheme,
or
whatever
kind
of
scheme
they
want
to
call
it,
that
takes
into
account
the
fact
that
persons
pay
licensing
fees
to
the
state,
and
they
can
do
it
in
a
number
of
ways.
they
can
give
a
credit
against
the
payment.
they
can
allow
it
as
a
deduction.
but
the
one
thing
they
cannot
do,
consistent
with
the
constitution
and
with
the
public
salary
tax
act,
is
to
give
a
total
exemption
to
those
who
pay
state
licensing
fees
that
are
unrelated
to
income,
while
at
the
same
time
attempt
to
tax
federal
employees,
and
in
this
case
federal
judges.
accordingly,
for
those
reasons,
the
judgment
should
be--
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
--they
cannot
do
that
for
two
reasons.
one,
because
the
scheme
is
no
longer
a
scheme...
a
tax
scheme
based
on
pay
or
compensation,
argument
number
one.
and
argument
number
two,
it
is
discriminatory
against
federal
employees
under
this
court's
decision
in
davis
against
michigan.
