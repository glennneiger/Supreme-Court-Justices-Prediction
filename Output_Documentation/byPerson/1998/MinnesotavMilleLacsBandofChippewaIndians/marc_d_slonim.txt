mr.
marc
d.
slonim
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i'd
like
to
take
just
a
moment
to
explain
what
this
case
is
about
from
the
chippewa's
perspective,
and
then
turn
to
the
1850
order
and
the
equal
footing
issues.
this
case
involves
core
indian
interests.
for
centuries,
the
chippewa
have
hunted,
fished,
and
gathered
wild
foods.
these
activities
still
put
food
on
their
tables.
they
help
pay
for
life's
necessities,
and
they
are
in
a
very
real
sense
central
to
the
culture
and
identity
of
the
chippewa.
mr.
marc
d.
slonim
that
is
correct,
your
honor,
but
they
could
not
use
fish
and
game
in
the
way
they
use
it
in
their
culture.
let
me
give
you
two
examples.
one
of
the
most
important
fishing
activities
for
the
chippewa
is
spring
spear
fishing.
it's
something
their
ancestors
have
done
for
generations.
they
still
do
today.
it
is
illegal
under
state
law
in
both
wisconsin
and
minnesota
to
spear
fish
in
the
spring.
in
each
of
these
reservation
communities,
there
are
families
that
are
providers.
mr.
marc
d.
slonim
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
marc
d.
slonim
in
the
springtime.
as
the
ice
moves
out
on
these
northern
lakes,
they
go
out
in
canoes
and
they
use
spears
and
lights
to
take
fish.
mr.
marc
d.
slonim
yes.
yes,
there
is,
your
honor.
mr.
marc
d.
slonim
it's
a
part
of
their
traditions,
and
they
spoke
to
it
in
testimony
in
this
case.
mr.
marc
d.
slonim
it's--
mr.
marc
d.
slonim
--it's
more
than
that,
your
honor,
and
there
was
testimony
in
the
trial
about
the
importance
of
these
activities
to
their
culture
and
to
their
religion.
mr.
marc
d.
slonim
they
have
to
sneak
out...
before
these
rights
were
reaffirmed
by
the
courts,
they
would
have
to
sneak
out
and
try
to
do
it
without
getting
caught.
that
was
the
only
way
they
could
do
it.
mr.
marc
d.
slonim
not
until
this
case
was
decided.
the
other
example
i
was
going
to
give
your
honor
was,
in
each
of
these
communities
there
are
people
that
are
providers.
they
go
out
and
they
get
fish
and
game
and
they
supply
it
to
elders
and
others
who
are
incapable
of
getting
it
themselves.
state
bag
limits
and
state
seasons
prevent
them
from
pursuing
those
activities,
from
providing
fish
and
game
at
funerals
which
occur
out
of
season,
or
for...
as
part
of
ceremonies
in
connection
with
births
or
other
life
cycle
events
that
happen
to
take
place
in
the
wrong
season.
they
cannot
preserve
these
traditions
if
they
are
subject
to
state
law,
and
that's
why
we're
here.
turning
to
the
1850
order,
i
wanted
to
provide
our
answer
to
justice
ginsburg's
question
about
what
the
indians
were
told
and
what
they
understood
at
the
time
the
1850
order
was
issued.
what
the
record
shows
is
that
they
were
told
that
the
order
was
an
order
to
remove.
they
were
not
told
that
the
order
was
an
order
to
stop
hunting
and
fishing,
or
would
have
any
effect
on
hunting
and
fishing.
they
were
told
they
had
to
move.
in
1855--
mr.
marc
d.
slonim
--there
was
evidence
that
a
circular
was
prepared
which
had
a
copy
of
the
order,
and
that
was
sent
to
the
bands
in
wisconsin,
which
were...
who
are
the
targets
of
the
removal
effort.
it
was
not
sent,
for
example,
to
the
mille
lacs
band,
which
was
never
a
target
of
the
removal
effort,
but
that's
what...
there
was
evidence
to
that
effect.
in
1855,
the
territorial
governor
of
minnesota,
who
was
the
superintendent
of
indian
affairs,
he
was
the
highest
federal
official
responsible
for
implementing
federal
indian
law
in
the
territory
of
minnesota,
wrote
a
letter
and
said
that
the
indians
had
no
interest
on
these
lands
except
hunting
and
fishing.
he
specifically
recognized,
5
years
after
this
order
was
issued,
that
they
had
hunting
and
fishing
rights
under
the
1837
treaty.
there
was
an
incident
up
at
mille
lacs
lake.
he
sent
an
investigator
there,
and
the
investigator
reported
that
the
lumbermen
and
all
of
the
chippewa
believed
that
they
still
had
hunting
and
fishing
rights
under
the
1837
treaty.
this
correspondence
went--
mr.
marc
d.
slonim
--we
have--
mr.
marc
d.
slonim
--two
theories,
your
honor,
first
that
it
was
null
and
void,
it
was
invalid
when
it
was
issued,
and
second
that
it
had
been
rejected
as
the
policy
of
the
united
states,
as
the
pleasure
of
the
president,
shortly
after
it
was
issued.
mr.
marc
d.
slonim
the
order,
the
purpose
of
the
order
was
to
remove
the
indians,
and
the
order
specifically
says
that
they're
ordered
to
remove.
in
addition
to
revoking
their
rights,
they're
hereby
ordered
to
remove.
mr.
marc
d.
slonim
well,
the
question
then
turns
on
whether
you
can
sever
the
order.
mr.
marc
d.
slonim
well,
you
do.
mr.
marc
d.
slonim
i
mean,
that's
the
issue,
is
should
you.
that's
the
issue.
mr.
marc
d.
slonim
yes.
mr.
marc
d.
slonim
yes,
your
honor,
but
with
the
caveat
that
you
would
apply--
mr.
marc
d.
slonim
--the
rules
you
apply
in
indian
cases.
mr.
marc
d.
slonim
well,
we
look
to
whether
the
order
would
have
been
issued
revoking
the
hunting
and
fishing
rights
in
the
absence
of
the
removal
directive,
and
all
of
the
evidence
was
that
it
would
not
have
been,
that
the
only
purpose
of
this
order
was
to
remove
the
indians.
mr.
marc
d.
slonim
sure.
the
territorial
legislature
requested
a
removal
order
because
they
said
the
indians
were
causing
problems,
and
it
doesn't
make
sense
to
say,
all
right,
in
response
to
that,
we'll
leave
the
indians
where
they
are,
but
tell
them
they
can't
hunt
and
fish
any
more.
that
doesn't--
mr.
marc
d.
slonim
--sure,
sure,
and
so
unless
you're
removing
them,
the
revocation
of
hunting
and
fishing
doesn't
serve
any
purpose.
the
only
purpose
it
serves
is
as
part
of
a
removal
effort,
and
that
effort
is
abandoned.
mr.
marc
d.
slonim
well,
let
me--
mr.
marc
d.
slonim
--i
think
the
federal
officials
who
were
involved
in
preparing
this
order
would
have
thought
it
illogical
to
order
the
indians
to
remove
at
the
same
time
they
retained
a
treaty
right
to
hunt
and
fish
on
the
lands
they
were
being
removed
from,
that,
if
that
wouldn't
have
made
sense
to
say,
you
still
have
a
treaty
right
to
hunt
and
fish
here,
but
you
have
to
leave.
mr.
marc
d.
slonim
right.
mr.
marc
d.
slonim
can
i
address
your
point
about
during
the
pleasure,
your
honor?
i'd
like
to
talk
about
that,
because
the
state's
interpretation
of
the
1837
treaty
and
the
president's
authority
under
that
treaty
we
think
is
really
quite
remarkable.
under
the
state's
interpretation,
the
president
could
revoke
these
rights
at
any
time.
he
could
revoke
them,
according
to
the
state,
as
part
of
an
unauthorized
removal
attempt,
which
led
to
hundreds
of
chippewa
deaths.
he
could
revoke
them
at
a
time,
as
the
district
court
found,
when
the
land
wasn't
needed
for
settlement
and
there
was
no
other
interest
of
the
united
states
served
by
the
revocation.
but
what
he
couldn't
do,
according
to
the
state,
is,
upon
learning
of
the
consequences
of
the
removal
order,
he
couldn't
allow
the
indians
to
remain
and
to
hunt
and
fish
during
his
pleasure.
in
other
words,
he
couldn't
do
the
one
thing
the
treaty
says
he
could
do,
and
that
doesn't
make
any
sense.
mr.
marc
d.
slonim
it's
up
to
the
president.
mr.
marc
d.
slonim
no,
because--
mr.
marc
d.
slonim
--well,
i
mean,
there's
a
process
in
the
constitution
for
how
that
happens,
and
it
says
you
have
to
be
removed,
and
there's
also
a
process
for
how
your
honors
are
appointed.
in
this
case
we
have
a
treaty
that
says
there's
a
privilege,
and
all
it
says
about
the
president
is,
it's
guaranteed
during
the
pleasure
of
the
president,
and
it
seems
to
me
perfectly
consistent
with
the
language
of
the
treaty
to
say
the
president
can
decide
if
he
made
a
mistake,
if
he
issued
this
order,
and
it
turned
out,
as
the
record
shows,
to
be
a
disaster,
that
it
turned
out,
as
the
record
shows,
that
there
wasn't
any
need
for
it,
to
say,
this
was
a
mistake,
they
can
stay,
and
during
my
pleasure
they
can
hunt
and
fish.
mr.
marc
d.
slonim
the
language
of
the
treaty,
the
rule
that
if
there
are
ambiguities
they
should
be
resolved
in
favor
of
the
indians,
and
the
understanding
of
the
indians,
as
shown
in
the
record
of
this
case.
mr.
marc
d.
slonim
yes,
your
honor,
and
it
would
not
be
the
president's
pleasure
to
end
it
unless
he
was
displeased
with
the
indians.
mr.
marc
d.
slonim
i
think
they
understood
that
it
was
too
soon
in
light
of
the
circumstances
that
were
present
then.
if
settlement
had
proceeded
at
a
different
pace,
the
answer
might
be
different,
but
there
were
no
demand
for
these
lands
at
that
time.
mr.
marc
d.
slonim
because
they
didn't
draft--
mr.
marc
d.
slonim
--the
answer
is
that
they
didn't
draft...
the
chippewa
didn't
draft
the
treaty.
mr.
marc
d.
slonim
they
made
x's,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
marc
d.
slonim
well,
your
honor,
there
were
a
lot
of
people
there
with
their
own
interests.
the
missionaries
wrote,
right
after
the
treaty
was
signed,
that
they
have
no
understanding
of
the
duration
of
a
man's
pleasure.
what
they
were
told--
mr.
marc
d.
slonim
--well--
mr.
marc
d.
slonim
--well,
what
they
were...
the
other
thing
they
were
told
throughout
this
treaty
council
was
that
they
would
be
treated
justly
by
the
president
and
that,
of
course,
was
a
reflection
of
the
provisions
in
the
northwest
ordinance,
the
trust
responsibility
as
articulated
by
this
court,
and
what
we
think
that
means
in
this
context
is
there
are
some
reasons
the
president
could
not
act,
and
that
was
the
case
in
1850.
