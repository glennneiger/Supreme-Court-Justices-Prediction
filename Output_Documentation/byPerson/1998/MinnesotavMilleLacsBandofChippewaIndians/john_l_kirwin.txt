mr.
john
l.
kirwin
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
is
about
two
principles
that
this
court
has
emphasized
repeatedly
in
recent
years,
upholding
the
traditional
scope
of
sovereignty
of
the
states,
and
upholding
the
plain
language
of
treaties
with
the
indians.
at
issue
here
is
an
indian
privilege
to
hunt
and
fish
in
an
area
of
minnesota
that
the
chippewa
indians
ceded
to
the
federal
government
in
an
1837
treaty.
under
the
treaty,
this
privilege
of
hunting,
fishing,
and
gathering,
was
guaranteed
to
the
indians
only
during
the
pleasure
of
the
president.
that
phrase
is
at
the
heart
of
this
dispute.
the
state
asserts
that
there
are
three
independent
events
which
terminated
the
temporary
privilege
under
the
1837
treaty,
an
executive
order
in
1850,
which
expressly
revoked
the
treaty
privilege,
minnesota's
admission
to
the
union
in
1858
on
an
equal
footing
with
the
original
states,
and
an
1855
treaty
which
revoked
any
and
all
rights
the
indians
had
at
that
time
in
minnesota
but
which
relates
to
only
one
of
the
bands
in
this
case.
mr.
john
l.
kirwin
your
honor,
the
lower
courts
held,
based
on
this
court's
decision
in
the
cases
from
the
northwestern
united
states,
that
it's
a
superior
right
that
it
guarantees
the
bands
the
right
to
take
an
allocation
of
the
fish
and
game
that
are
available
to
hunt
without
complying
with
the
regulations
of
the
state
that
apply
to
other
persons.
mr.
john
l.
kirwin
in
1837,
your
honor,
there
weren't
any
regulations,
and
there
weren't
any
until
minnesota
became
a
state
in
1858
and
enacted
hunting
and
fishing
laws.
mr.
john
l.
kirwin
that
would
be
true,
your
honor,
as
long
as
neither
the
federal
government
nor
the
territories
that
covered
that
area
passed
any
hunting
and
fishing
laws.
mr.
john
l.
kirwin
that's
right.
mr.
john
l.
kirwin
that's
correct,
your
honor,
and
we
think
that
the
principal
effect
of
the
privilege
and
the
revocation
of
the
privilege
was
something
that
was
recognized
by
president
andrew
jackson
in
his
1829
state
of
the
union
address,
and
he
said
that
if
the
indians
were
asked
to
voluntarily
remove
from
the
area
but
refused
to
do
so,
then
they
would
have
to
understand
that
they
would
be
subject
to
the
laws
of
the
state,
and
so
as
the
lower
courts
interpreted
this
privilege,
the
effect
of
it
is
to
make
the
indians
not
subject
to
many
of
the
laws
of
the
states
of
minnesota
and
wisconsin.
mr.
john
l.
kirwin
your
honor,
what
this
court
has
said
in
the
cases
coming
from
the
northwest
united
states,
puyallup
ii,
antoine,
passenger
fishing
vessel,
is
that
the
state
can
regulate
in
the
interest
of
conservation,
the
lower
courts
have
extended
that
to
health
and
safety,
but
that
the
state's
regulatory
authority
is
limited.
there
are
significant
encroachments
on
the
state's
regulatory
authority.
mr.
john
l.
kirwin
your
honor,
it
appears
under
the
lower
courts
rulings
in
this
case,
based
on
this
court's
earlier
decisions,
that
the
state
would
be
very
limited
in
regulating
to
limit
hunting
and
fishing
seasons,
for
example.
if
the
bands
were
to
insist
on--
mr.
john
l.
kirwin
--if
the
bands
insisted
on
taking
more
than
half
of
the
resource,
the
state
probably
could
prevent
that
with
the
federal
court's
assistance.
mr.
john
l.
kirwin
your
honor,
in
the
cases
from
the
northwestern
united
states,
this
court
seemed
to
recognize
that
the
indians
had
a
right
to
a
share
of
the
hunting
and
fishing
resource,
but
that
non-indians
also
had
a
right
to
a
share,
and
so
this
court
said
that
45
or
50
percent
might
be
the
maximum
indian
share.
the
lower
courts
in
this
case
seemed,
although
it's
not
entirely
clear
from
their
opinions,
they
seem
to
have
adopted--
mr.
john
l.
kirwin
--that's
correct,
your
honor,
and
ruling
on
particular
kinds
of
regulation,
and
the
state's
concern
here
is
that
under
the
lower
court's
decision,
that
we
have
the
same
situation
already.
mr.
john
l.
kirwin
your
honor,
the
ground
rules,
as
i
understand
them
in
wisconsin,
are
that
the
bands
are
entitled
to
take
half
of
the
available
resource,
and
so
the...
and
the
state
of
wisconsin
then
has
been
required
to
allow
the
bands
to
do
that.
mr.
john
l.
kirwin
without
regard
to
hunting
seasons
or
times
of
day
and
so
on.
the
state
can
make
limited
regulations
for
purposes
of
conserving
or
assuring
the
preservation
of
the
species.
the
states
can
make
limited
regulations
for
purposes
of
public
safety,
but
there
is
certainly
a
significant
encroachment
on
the
state's
ability
to
regulate
under
this
court's
decisions
and
as
they've
been
applied
by
the
lower
court
here.
mr.
john
l.
kirwin
that's
correct,
your
honor,
yes,
and
the
state
asserts
that
this
hunting
and
fishing
privilege
was
terminated
by
three
events,
but
the
most
basic
of
these,
we
think,
was
the
president's
executive
order
in
1850
expressly
terminating
the
privilege.
mr.
john
l.
kirwin
your
honor,
there
was
some
discussion
in
the
lower
courts,
particularly
by
the
landowners,
as
to
what
the
particular
nature
of
the
right
might
be.
as
far
as
the
state
is
concerned,
it
probably
is
unique.
what's
unique
about
it
is
that
it's
something
that
comes
from
the
indian
title
to
the
land,
and
so
it's
part
of
the
indian
title
which
includes
an
element
of
sovereignty
or
quasi-sovereignty,
but
what
this
court
made
clear
in
the
winans
case
is
that
when
indians
cede
land
to
the
federal
government,
but
there's
a
reserved
hunting
and
fishing
right,
that
what's
reserved
is
a
part
of,
a
remnant
of
that
original
interest
that
the
indians
had
in
the
land.
mr.
john
l.
kirwin
well,
it's...
your
honor,
i
think
the
important
point
is,
it's
part
of
the
indians'
original
indian
title.
it
may
be
the
sovereignty
part
of
that
rather
than
some
other
part
of
it,
but
nonetheless
it
certainly
is--
mr.
john
l.
kirwin
--your
honor--
mr.
john
l.
kirwin
--i
think--
mr.
john
l.
kirwin
--right,
and
i
think,
your
honor,
that
it's
different
when
you're
dealing
with
indian
cessions
of
property,
as
the
court
recognized
in
winans,
as
the
court
recognized
in
the
klamath
case,
where
the
court
said
that
where
the
indians
ceded
all
right,
title,
and
interest
to
the
land,
the
court
said,
undoubtedly
any
special
rights
they
had
to
hunt
and
fish
went
along
with
that,
because
what
it
is
is
a
sovereign
selling
not
only
the
land,
but
their
special
rights
in
the
land,
and
to
regulate
the
land,
and
to
use
it
as
they
see
fit.
they're
conveying
all
of
that.
and
what
the
court
said
in
winans
is
that
where
you
have
a
conveyance
of
the
land,
that
a
reservation
of
the
right...
and
the
court
was
very
emphatic
about
this.
the
court
said
that
the
hunting
and
fishing
right
isn't
a
grant
to
the
indians,
but
the
indians
are
granting
the
land
to
the
government,
or
conveying
the
land
to
the
government
and
preserving
something.
they're
preserving
a
remnant
of
what
they
have,
and
the
total--
mr.
john
l.
kirwin
--that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
john
l.
kirwin
your
honor,
in
their
final
amended
petition
or
complaint
before
the
indian
claims
commission
the
indians
had
not
mentioned
hunting
and
fishing.
mr.
john
l.
kirwin
right.
they
did
mention
it
at
earlier
stages
and,
in
fact,
before
the
court
of
claims,
which
was
the
beginning
of
that
process
for
them,
they
specifically
asserted
that
the
privilege
under
the
treaty
was
temporary,
and
that
the
federal
government
had
ended
it.
now,
they
were
not
making
that
claim
at
the
end
of
the
icc
proceeding,
but
i
think
an
important
thing
about
the
icc
proceeding
is
that
the
band's
experts
proposed
a
value
for
the
land
based
on
its
highest
and
most
valuable
uses,
and
the
icc
awarded
the
band
an
award
of
an
additional
$9
million,
about
ten
times
as
much
as
the
original
payment,
to
compensate
them
for
the
entirety
of
the
land
according
to
its
highest,
most
valuable
uses.
and
this
court
recognized
in
the
klamath
case
that
where
an
indian
band
or
tribe
receives
full
compensation
without
any
deduction
for
hunting
and
fishing
rights,
then
presumptively
that
compensation
includes
the
hunting
and
fishing
rights,
too,
that
if
there
had
been
reserved
hunting
and
fishing
rights,
there
should
have
been
a
deduction
for
them,
because
the
indians
were
paid
as...
in
klamath
as
though
they
were
conveying
all
their
indian
title
to
the
land,
which
included
hunting
and
fishing
rights.
mr.
john
l.
kirwin
your
honor,
by
the
end
of
the
proceeding
it
was
all
of
the
bands
in
this
case.
mr.
john
l.
kirwin
we
don't
know
the
explanation
of
that
for
sure.
i
think
the
most
likely
explanation
is
that
they
were
negotiated
by
different
people.
the
1854
treaty
was
negotiated
by
an
indian
agent
out
in
wisconsin.
the
1855
treaty
was
negotiated
by
commissioner
manypenny
himself,
and
he
had
the
indians...
the
indian
chiefs
brought
to
washington
to
negotiate
with
him,
and
when
you
look
at
the
1854
treaty,
as
you
point
out
there
was
actually
a
grant
of
some
hunting
and...
a
reservation
of
some
hunting
and
fishing
rights
in
quite
a
remote
area
of
minnesota.
the
whole
approach
of
the
treaty
next
year
was
different,
in
1855.
not
only
did
it
not
reserve
hunting
and
fishing
rights
in
the
area
ceded
in
that
treaty,
but
there
was
a
catch-all
provision
under
which
the
indians
ceded
any
and
all
right,
title,
and
interest
of
whatsoever
nature
they
may
be,
a
sort
of--
mr.
john
l.
kirwin
--your
honor,
it
was
the
right,
title--
mr.
john
l.
kirwin
--it
has
the
language
in
and
to
the
land.
mr.
john
l.
kirwin
yes.
yes,
and
as
this
court
recognized
in
the
klamath
case
that
the
ordinary
construction
of
meaning,
or
of
language
like
that
is
to
convey
special
hunting
and
fishing
rights.
mr.
john
l.
kirwin
your
honor,
i
agree
that
there's
a
burden,
but
i
think
the
burden
goes
the
other
way.
as
this
court
recognized
in
klamath,
when
you're
dealing
with
indian
relinquishment
of
rights
and
selling
of
land,
the
context
is
different,
and
the
understanding
is
that
when
indians
sell
all
their
right,
title,
and
interest
in
and
to
land,
that
unlike
a
private
landowner,
the
indians
are
selling
any
special
hunting
and
fishing
rights
they
had.
and
in
the
klamath
case
and
in
the
yankton
case,
this
court
talked
about
the
almost
insurmountable
presumption
that
arises
from
such
plain
language.
we
agree
that
there's
a
burden,
but
we
think
the
burden
is
on
the
other
side
to
show
that
the
treaty
meant
something
other
than
what
it
seemed
to
say
on
its
face.
mr.
john
l.
kirwin
could
have.
mr.
john
l.
kirwin
could
have.
mr.
john
l.
kirwin
there
isn't
any
question
about
that
today,
although
there
may
well
have
been
a
question
about
that
in
1837,
because
the
indians
weren't
citizens.
in
essence,
they
were--
mr.
john
l.
kirwin
--your
honor,
it
wasn't,
but
it
was
because
neither
a
territory
nor
state
nor
the
federal
government
had
placed
that
limitation--
mr.
john
l.
kirwin
--on
the
indians.
mr.
john
l.
kirwin
right.
mr.
john
l.
kirwin
no,
your
honor.
that
was
the
situation
at
that
time,
but
one
way
of
looking
at
this
is
that
what
was
guaranteed
to
the
indians
was
that
they
would
be
able
to
continue
to
do
that,
and
that
the
federal
government
or,
more
importantly,
a
territory
or
a
state
wouldn't
take
that
right
away
from
them.
mr.
john
l.
kirwin
your
honor,
the
record
doesn't
show
that
the
territory
of
minnesota
did,
or
wisconsin.
mr.
john
l.
kirwin
i
believe
that
wisconsin
territory
in
1837,
which
included
this
area
and
minnesota
territory
later,
did
not
include
hunting
and
fishing
regulations.
it
was
only
when
minnesota
became
a
state
in
1858.
mr.
chief
justice,
if
i
may,
i'd
like
to
reserve--
mr.
john
l.
kirwin
--your
honor,
we
have
not
argued
this
in
our
brief,
but
we
don't
concede--
mr.
john
l.
kirwin
--your
honor,
i'd
like
to
make
a
quick,
two-part
response
to
that.
one
is
that
president
taylor's
purpose
in
doing
that
would
very
likely
have
been
what
president
jackson
said
in
1829
when
he
was
talking
about
removal,
and
he
said
that
the
indians
must
understand
that
if
they
don't
remove,
they'll
be
subject
to
the
laws
of
the
states,
and
wisconsin
had
just
become
a
state
in
1848,
minnesota
had
just
become
a
territory
and
was
soon
to
become
a
state,
and
so
the
president
could
very
well
have
wanted
to
clear
the
decks
to
allow
those
states
to
engage
in
their
normal
state
regulation.
and
the
second
point
is
that,
yes,
the
federal
government
did
allow
the
indians
to
hunt
on
the
land
after
this
time.
the
federal
government
provided
them
equipment
and
so
on
to
do
this,
but
that
doesn't
indicate
whether
they
were
intended
to
be
hunting
pursuant
to
state
law
or
not
pursuant
to
state
law
and,
in
fact,
the
federal
government
provided
them
with
the
same
assistance
in
hunting
and
fishing
in
the
1855
treaty
area,
where
they
had
no
reserved
hunting
and
fishing
right,
and
so
the
fact
that
the
federal
government
supported
them
in
that
simply
is
no
indication
one
way
or
the
other
on
that
point.
mr.
john
l.
kirwin
well,
your
honor--
mr.
john
l.
kirwin
--your
honor,
all
i'm
saying
is,
the
federal
government
providing
them
those
materials
doesn't
give
any
indication
one
way
or
the
other
on
that
point.
