mr.
randy
v.
thompson
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i'd
like
to
address
two
issues,
first,
the
president's
decision
under
the
1850
order
and
why
it
is
not
reviewable
and,
secondly,
why
the
indian
claims
commission
operates
as
a
jurisdictional
bar
in
this
case.
but
briefly,
before
i
begin,
justice
kennedy
and
justice
o'connor
asked
questions
about
whether
or
not
these
were
property
interests,
these
hunting
and
fishing
privileges.
this
court
made
that
clear,
i
believe,
in
klamath,
and
it
had
made
it
clear
in
kennedy
v.
becker,
which
klamath
refers
to,
that
a
privilege
to
hunt
and
fish
is
subject
to
state
regulation,
and
it
is
in
the
nature
of
a
profit
of
prendre.
we,
of
course,
have--
mr.
randy
v.
thompson
--i'm
sorry.
a
profit
of
prendre.
mr.
randy
v.
thompson
i
believe
that
the
evidence
demonstrates
that
when
the
treaties
were
signed,
because
they
were
land
cession
treaties,
the
language
used
was
the
typical
language
of
real
estate
conveyance.
if
you
look
at
the
language
of
this
treaty,
during
the
pleasure
of
the
president,
and
the
explanation
in
the
treaty
journal
that
they
will
be
allowed
and
permitted
during
the
president's
pleasure
to
hunt
and
fish
upon
the
lands,
that's
precisely
the
language
of
a
real
estate
license.
i
under--
mr.
randy
v.
thompson
--sure.
mr.
randy
v.
thompson
certainly,
and
let
me
address
that
first.
i
think
that
the
language
of
the
treaty
journal
demonstrates
that
during
the
pleasure
of
the
president
was,
in
fact,
explained
to
the
indians.
it
was
referenced
twice
in
the
treaty
journal,
and
it
was
explained
that
they
would
be
allowed
and
permitted
during
his
pleasure
to
hunt
and
fish
upon
the
land,
and
it
would
probably
be
many
years
before
the
great
father
would
want
all
of
these
lands
for
his
white
children.
now,
that's
not
a
guarantee
that
it
would
be
many
years,
but
it
was
an
indication
that
neither
party
was
certain
as
to
how
quickly
settlement
pressures
were
going
to
occur.
mr.
randy
v.
thompson
well,
i'm
not
certain
that
that's
the
case,
because
we
simply
don't
know
what
the
bands
were
thinking
in
1837,
other
than
what
we
have
in
the
treaty.
mr.
randy
v.
thompson
that's
right.
that's
right,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
the
plain
language
we
believe
controls
here,
and
that
the...
there
is
no
ambiguity,
and
there
was
no
finding
of
ambiguity
in
the
language,
during
the
pleasure
of
the
president.
mr.
randy
v.
thompson
well--
mr.
randy
v.
thompson
--well,
we
submit
that
while
taylor
probably
could
have
suspended,
given
the
power
he
had
over
this
privilege,
he
did
not
do
so.
he
revoked
it.
once
he
revoked
it,
we
do
not
believe
that
the
executive
branch
had
any
authority
to
reinstate
that
privilege.
certainly
congress
could
have,
but
the
executive
branch
did
not.
there's
nothing
in
the
treaty
to
suggest
it.
i
would
refer
the
court,
for
example,
to
the
language
of
the
federal
convention
in
which
the
term
maladministration
was
proposed
as
a
term
for,
under
the
impeachment
article,
and
james
madison
responded
that
such
a
term
would
be
tenure
during
the
pleasure
of
the
senate.
i
don't
think
james
madison
was
referring
to
the
fact
that
they
could
put
the
president
in
and
out
of
office.
mr.
randy
v.
thompson
well,
it
is
true,
and
i
think
this
court
addressed
it
specifically
in
klamath,
in
which
the
court
indicated
that
legal
ambiguities
are
resolved
in
favor
of
the
indians,
and
i
believe
they
cited
decoteau
for
that
proposition.
but
the
court
cannot
ignore
plain
language,
viewed
in
the
historical
context
and
given
the
fair
appraisal,
that
runs
counter
to
the
band's
claims.
mr.
randy
v.
thompson
besides
the
president's
order?
is
that
what...
i'm
confused,
justice--
mr.
randy
v.
thompson
--well,
i
believe
that
the
presidential
order
was,
in
fact,
communicated
to
the
indians,
and--
mr.
randy
v.
thompson
--well,
the
evidence
in
the
record
demonstrates
that
they
received
it.
after
all,
they
even
sent
a
delegation
to
washington
in
1852
to
lobby
president
fillmore
to
revoke
the
order,
and
were
unsuccessful,
so
we
know
that
this
was
communicated
to
them,
that
the
president
had
issued
his
1850
executive
order.
was
i
responsive
to
your
question?
mr.
randy
v.
thompson
well,
remember,
justice
ginsburg,
we're
on
the
edge
of
the
american
frontier,
and
very
difficult
for,
even
if
the
united
states
had
wanted
to
enforce
certain
actions,
to
actually
enforce
hunting
and
fishing
regulations,
and
it
was
really
left
up
to
the
states
when
they
were
formed
as
to--
mr.
randy
v.
thompson
--that's
correct.
if
i
might
address
the
indian
claims
commission
act
briefly--
mr.
randy
v.
thompson
--well,
the...
we
raise
the
indian
claims
commission
act
as
a
jurisdictional
bar
on
the
basis
that
jurisdiction
be
raised
at
any
time
with
this
court.
if
the
court
does
not
want
me
to
address
it,
i'd
be
certainly...
i'll
address
something
else,
but--
mr.
randy
v.
thompson
--yes.
the
lower
courts
decided
that
it
did
not
operate
as
a
bar.
mr.
randy
v.
thompson
it
was
not
within
the
state's
petition.
it's
within
the
landowner's
petition
that's
pending.
mr.
randy
v.
thompson
the--
mr.
randy
v.
thompson
--i'm
sorry.
the--
mr.
randy
v.
thompson
--okay.
the...
we
believe
that
the
indian
claims
commission
act
operates
as
a
jurisdictional
bar
because
it
really
has
two
provisions
that
are
operable
here.
you
have
section
12
that
says,
any
claim
against
the
united
states
that
was
pending
and
could
have
been
brought
as
of
august
1946
had
to
be
brought
within
5
years
or
it
was
barred.
under
section
22,
if
a
claim
was
brought
and
paid,
it
is
also
barred,
as
this
court
decided
in
the
united
states
v.
dann.
it
really
doesn't
matter
for
the
analysis,
in
our
view,
whether
the
claim
was
brought
and
paid
or
not.
under
either
analysis,
it
is
barred.
now,
the
bands
will
argue
that
this
is
not
a
claim
against
the
united
states,
so
the
icc
doesn't
operate
as
a
bar.
but
the
solicitor
general
in
the
oglala
case
petitioned,
when
they
opposed
grant
of
petition
of
cert
to
this
court,
argued
that
the
bar
against
the
state
of...
the
united
states
also
operated
as
a
bar
in
that
case
against
the
claim
against
south
dakota,
which
involves
the
black
hills
claim.
we
believe
that
it
was
part
of
the
indian
claims
commission
act,
claim
made
by
this
bands
in
docket
18(c).
it
was
part
of
the
original
pleadings.
the
pleadings
were
amended
to
ask
for
the
highest
and
best
use,
instead
of
asking
for
specific
items,
but
that
merely
reflects
what
the
icc
was
doing,
giving
a
single
award
based
on
the
highest
and
best
use.
without
an
offset,
as
this
court
has
indicated
in
klamath,
that
operates
as
a
bar,
so
the
petition
of
the
landowners
in
this
case
is
under
the
indian
claims
commission
act.
this
is
a
case
that
certainly
could
have
been
brought
against
the
united
states
of
america--
mr.
randy
v.
thompson
--well--
mr.
randy
v.
thompson
--i
would
address
this
as
follows.
certainly
it
can
be
analyzed
under
res
judicata
or
collateral
estoppel
or
election
of
remedies
defense,
but
the
eighth
circuit
in
oglala
i,
which
is
a
case
against
the
united
states
and
the
state
of
south
dakota,
also
recognized
that
it
operated
as
a
jurisdictional...
it
deprived
the
district
court
of
jurisdiction
to
even
hear
the
action,
because
the
indian
claims
commission
was
designed
to
hear
all
claims
pending
against
the
united
states
in
1946,
and
this
action
is
at
heart--
mr.
randy
v.
thompson
--correct,
your
honor.
mr.
randy
v.
thompson
thank
you.
