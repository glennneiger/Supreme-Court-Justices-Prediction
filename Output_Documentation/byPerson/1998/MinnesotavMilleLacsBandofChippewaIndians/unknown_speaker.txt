unknown
speaker
mr.
kirwin,
may
i
ask
you
to
clarify
what
was
the
nature
of
the
right?
it's
a
little
confusing
in
the
briefs.
is
it
a
superior
right
to
what
any
other
person
would
have
to
hunt
and
fish,
or
just
the
same
right?
unknown
speaker
in
1837,
was
there
any
difference,
because
as
i
understand
it
there
weren't
any
regulations.
unknown
speaker
so
that
legally,
if
the
revocation
had
occurred
in
1838,
all
of
the
members
of
the
indian
bands
could
have
continued
to
do,
so
far
as
the
law
was
concerned,
exactly
what
they
thought
they
had
a
right
to
do
under
the
treaty,
is
that
correct?
unknown
speaker
right,
but
in
fact
there
were
none,
as
you
said.
unknown
speaker
so
if
there
had
been
a
revocation...
excuse
me...
they
could
have
gone
on
doing
it.
unknown
speaker
but
i
thought
it
was
conceded
that
the
state
can
place
some
limits
on
the
harvest
that
the
indians
can
take.
isn't
that...
that
puzzled
me.
by
what
authority
can
the
state
impose
some
limitations?
unknown
speaker
well,
what
could
the
state
do,
in
your
view,
under
the
cases
from
the
pacific
northwest
in
terms
of
regulation
or
limiting
the
season
for
taking
fish
and
game,
or
the
quantity?
unknown
speaker
well,
it's
very
unclear
to
me
what
you
think,
under
existing
precedent,
if
we
were
to
affirm,
what
do
you
think
the
state
could
do
in
terms
of
regulation?
unknown
speaker
why?
why
so?
i
mean,
if
the
treaty
gives
them
hunting
and
fishing
rights,
i
assume
they
can
hunt
and
fish
to
their
heart's
content.
unknown
speaker
in
the
pacific
northwest
cases
some
of
them
ended
up
with
the
district
court
kind
of
serving
almost
as
a
master,
didn't
they,
in
allocating
various
percentages?
unknown
speaker
what
has
been
worked
out
in
wisconsin,
where
there's
been
a
previous
decision
upholding
the
right
of
the
tribes
to
hunt
and
fish,
and
yet
the
state
has
somehow
worked
out
some
kind
of
a...
an
agreement
with
the
tribe.
what
sort
of
agreement
has
been
worked
out?
unknown
speaker
at
any
time,
without
regard
to
the
time
of
the
taking?
unknown
speaker
this
applies
only,
of
course,
on
public
lands
on
which
hunting
and
fishing
are
permitted.
it
doesn't
extend
to
private--
unknown
speaker
--the
parties
stay
away
from
any
property
analogies.
they
don't
say
that
this
is
an
easement,
or
a
profit,
and
i
assume
that's
because
it's
not
helpful.
this
is
a...
and
this
is
a
discrete
area
of
the
law.
this
is--
unknown
speaker
--i
don't--
--but
it's
a
sovereign
interest
and
not
a
property
interest
that
we're
talking
about,
or
not
a
sovereign
interest,
depending
on
how
you
come
out.
unknown
speaker
well,
is
there
any
authority
from
this
court
that
the
right
to
hunt
and
fish
is
an
interest
in
real
property?
unknown
speaker
have
we
treated
it
as
such?
unknown
speaker
that's
such
an
odd
concept,
because
if
a
non-indian
person
wanted
to
hunt
or
fish,
one
wouldn't
talk
about
that
in
terms
of
a
property
interest,
would
they?
unknown
speaker
let
me
ask
you
a
couple
of
things
that
i'm
curious
about.
the
petition...
the
respondents
here
got
an
award
from
the
indian
claims
commission--
unknown
speaker
--in
1970.
did
that
have
any
effect
on
the
right
to
fish
and
hunt
and
gather
wild
rice?
did
the
claim
encompass
any
of
that
when
they
were
compensated?
unknown
speaker
it
was
not
mentioned.
unknown
speaker
was
this
the
fond
du
lac
band
that
had
the
case
in
the
indian
claims
commission,
or
the
mille
lacs
band,
or--
unknown
speaker
--all
of
the
bands.
one
other
question.
it
was
odd
that
there
were
subsequent
treaties,
one
in
1854
and
one
in
1855,
and
they
were
different.
the
united
states
revoked
treaty
rights
for
the
mille
lacs
band
in
1855
treaty,
but
it
didn't
do
so
with
the
other
bands
in
the
1854
treaty.
is
there
any
explanation
for
that?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
thought
it
was
right,
title,
and
interest
in
land.
unknown
speaker
and
your
argument
was,
land
carries
with
it
the
hunting
and
fishing
rights.
they
didn't...
as
i
recall,
the
terms
of
the
1855
treaty
were
not
that
they
ceded
every
right,
title,
and
interest
of
any
sort
whatsoever.
that
isn't
the
way
it
read,
is
it?
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
well,
but
the
trouble
is,
the...
i
mean,
we've
got
to
judge
ordinary
construction
in
terms
of
this
treaty,
and
one
of
the
problems
that
we
have,
it
seems
to
me,
in
seeing
it
your
way,
is
just
as
was
pointed
out
earlier,
at
the
time
in
question
anyone
could
have
engaged
in
this
sort
of
hunting
and
fishing.
i
could
have...
you
know,
my
ancestors
could
have
wandered
onto
the
land
and
done
it.
they
never
had
any
interest
in
the
land.
so
it
seems
to
me
you've
got
at
least
a
burden
to
show
that
there
was
an
understanding
that
hunting
and
fishing
rights
were
thought
to
be
rights
in
the
land,
as
opposed
to
rights
which
any
member
of
the
public,
without
any
history
of
property
ownership,
could
have
exercised,
and
i
think
that's
where
i
have
difficulty
in
seeing
how
you
make
your
argument.
unknown
speaker
well,
isn't
it
also
the
case
that
any,
what
you
might
call
nonspecial
hunting
and
fishing
rights,
souter-type
hunting
and
fishing
rights--
[laughter]
--there's
no
question
that
the
indians
retained
that.
they
can...
i
mean,
there's
no
dispute
that
they
can
hunt
and
fish
to
the
same
extent
that
justice
souter
can,
were
justice
souter--
unknown
speaker
--a
citizen
of
your
state.
unknown
speaker
could
have,
right.
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
no,
but
i
thought
you
indicated...
and
i
don't
want
to
put
words
in
your
mouth,
but
i
thought
you
indicated
in
an
earlier
answer
to
me
that
anyone,
quote-unquote,
could
have
gone
on
the
land
and
engaged
in
this
hunting
and
fishing.
i
didn't
understand
that
citizenship
was
a
condition
of
it.
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
there
simply
was
no
regulation--
unknown
speaker
--of
any,
legal
regulation
of
any
sort.
i
thought
we
established
that
with
your
very
first
response,
that
until
1858
there
was
no
regulation.
anybody
could
hunt
and
fish,
and
there
was
no
proscription
applied
specially
to
the
indians.
are
you
retreating
from
that?
unknown
speaker
well,
mr.
kirwin,
are
you
sure
that
the
territory
of
minnesota
never
had
any
hunting
regulations?
unknown
speaker
or
did
or...
does
it
show
that
it
did
not?
unknown
speaker
can
i
ask
you
a
question
before...
i'd
like
to
know
what
your
response
is
to
the
solicitor
general's
argument
on
what
i
think
is
the
main
point.
you
say
that
as
president
taylor
revoked
the
hunting
and
fishing
and
gathering
rights
and
also
told
them
to
remove,
and
i
take
it
you
concede
that
the
part
that
says
remove
is
unlawful.
unknown
speaker
well,
anyway,
you're
not
contesting
it,
and
in
that
case
the
question
is
severability,
and
i
just
want
to
know...
i
mean,
as
a
matter
of
common
sense
it's
pretty
hard
to
think
that
president
taylor,
had
he
known
that
they
weren't
going
to
remove,
would
have
wanted
to
have
them
sit
there
and
starve.
i
mean,
there's
no
evidence
of
that,
is
there,
that
anybody
would
want
them
to
stay
on
their
land
and
starve,
nor
is
there
any
evidence
that
they
would
have
used
this
to
try
to
evict
them,
since
the
way
to
try
to
evict
them
was
to
get
them
to
go
take
their
annuity
1,000
miles
away,
and
that
didn't
work,
so
how
would
the
other
have
worked?
and
then
the
sg's
brief
is
just
filled
with
instances
where
the
government
went
and
gave
them
rifles
and
fishing
gear
and
i
guess
maybe
gathering
equipment
and
all
kinds
of
stuff
all
the
time,
so
when
i
read
that,
i
thought,
well,
gee,
there's
100
years
of
everybody
thinking
that
they
could
fish
and
hunt
and
gather,
and
what's
the
evidence
that
this
would
have
been...
that
zachary
taylor
would
have
wanted
the
one
to
stay
even
though
the
other
fell?
unknown
speaker
it
may
be
an
indication
that
the
federal
government
understood
that
the
1855
treaty
did
not
convey
any
hunting
and
fishing
rights.
unknown
speaker
i
mean,
we...
in
terms
of
the
evidence,
the
evidence
is
equivocal.
it
doesn't...
i
don't
see
that
it
supports
you
clearly.
unknown
speaker
thank
you,
mr.
kirwin.
mr.
thompson,
we'll
hear
from
you.
unknown
speaker
of
what?
of
profit
of
prendre?
unknown
speaker
but
the
question
is
whether
it
would
have
been
understood
by
the
parties
to
this
treaty
at
the
time
as
an
interest
in
land.
i
mean,
we're
construing
treaty
language,
and
one
of
the
difficulties,
i
think,
that
you
have
in
maintaining
your
position
is,
as
we
said
earlier,
that
the
interest
was
an
interest
which
could
be
exercised
ad
lib,
as
it
were,
by
anybody,
given
the
state
of
regulation
at
that
time.
unknown
speaker
well,
may
i
just
ask
you...
i
don't
want
to
cut
you
off,
but
that
raises
another
point
that
i
want
you
to
address.
unknown
speaker
there
was
a
considerable
amount
of
material
in
the
briefs
on
the
other
side
to
the
effect
that
it
is
highly
unlikely,
almost
to
the
point
of
impossible,
that
the
indian
parties
to
the
treaty
understood
the
phrase,
at
the
president's
pleasure,
in
the
way
that
we
would
understand
it
as
property
lawyers
today.
and
specifically
there
was
a
fair
amount
of
information
to
the
effect
that
the
indian
parties
to
the
treaties
specifically
assumed
that
they
would
enjoy
these
hunting
and
fishing
rights
as
of
right
for
a
considerable
period
of
time,
certainly
beyond
the
point
of
the
claimed
revocation,
so
in
your
answer,
would
you
address
that,
too?
unknown
speaker
but
of
course,
the...
i
suppose
the
intransigence
of
the
tribes
at
the
time
the
removal
order
came
down,
which
ultimately
the
united
states
caved
in
to,
is
probably
some
indication
of
what
they
thought
the
period
of
time
was
that
they
were
agreeing
to.
unknown
speaker
well,
we
usually
interpret
treaties
by
their
language,
don't
we,
i
mean,
just
reading
the
language?
unknown
speaker
well,
there's
at
least
this
ambiguity,
does
during
the
pleasure
of
the
president
mean
he
only
gets
one
shot
at
canceling
it,
or
does
it
mean
whenever
the
president
wants
you
to
hunt
and
fish
you
may,
and
whenever
he
doesn't,
you
may
not?
unknown
speaker
in
other
words,
was
the...
assuming
that
it
was
severable,
was
the
presidential
termination
of
the
hunting
and
fishing
rights
irrevocable,
or
could
later
presidents
reinstitute
the
hunting
and
fishing
rights?
unknown
speaker
but
we
do
have
also
some
notion
that
we
read
these
treaties
in
the
light
of
knowing
that
the
party
on
the
other
side
couldn't
even
speak
the
same
language,
so
the
interpretation
is
more
favorable
than
if
these
were
two
sophisticated
parties,
meaning
with
equal
language
facility,
sophistication,
isn't
that
so?
unknown
speaker
is
there
any
indication
that
the
tribes
had...
since
it's
been
stated
that
there
was
no
regulation,
so
nothing
would
have
changed,
revocation
or
not,
from
1850
until
1858,
when
this...
the
introduction
of
regulation.
is
there
anything
that
indicates
that
the
indians
were
told,
now
you
have
no
more
hunting
and
fishing
privileges?
unknown
speaker
yes.
was
there
anything
that
brought
that
order
home
to
the
indians?
was
there
any
communication
that
said,
the
president
did
something
that's
going
to
change
circumstances
for
you?
unknown
speaker
you
believe
it
based
on
what?
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
there
was
still
no
change
in
actual
circumstances,
in
what
they
could
do.
unknown
speaker
but
there
were
no...
we
were
told,
as
far
as
this
record
shows,
the
first
regulation
comes
in
in
1858.
unknown
speaker
is
that
part
of
the...
did
we
grant
cert
on
that
question?
unknown
speaker
well,
you
did
present
that
argument
to
the
lower
courts,
and
there
was
some
disposition
of
it,
was
there
not?
unknown
speaker
and
you
didn't...
and
there's
no
question
before
us.
unknown
speaker
if
it's
jurisdictional,
i'd
like
to
hear
it
anyway.
unknown
speaker
it
won't
add
anything--
unknown
speaker
--if
there's
a
jurisdictional
point
to
argue,
let's
hear
from
him.
unknown
speaker
i
don't
understand
why
that
isn't
a
defense,
rather
than
a
jurisdictional
point.
in
other
words,
if
you're
talking
about
subject
matter
jurisdiction
it's
a
question
we're
obliged
to
raise
on
our
own,
but
what
you
seem
to
be
presenting
is
a
defense
to
a
claim--
unknown
speaker
--not
a
question
of
the
court's
authority.
unknown
speaker
this
is
the
same
circuit
that
ruled
against
you
on
it?
unknown
speaker
thank
you,
mr.
thompson.
unknown
speaker
mr.
slonim,
we'll
hear
from
you.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
suppose
if
state
regulation
were
applicable,
they
would
be
entitled
to
hunt
and
fish,
as
anyone
else
would,
with
a
hunting
and
fishing
license.
unknown
speaker
excuse
me,
did
you
say
spring
spear
fishing?
unknown
speaker
and
that
means
in
the
spring
season?
unknown
speaker
is
there
some
religious
significance
to
this?
i
mean,
i--
unknown
speaker
--there
is.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
mean,
certainly
it
can
be
a
part
of
your
tradition
and
not
have
any
religious
connotation.
i
mean,
if
all
you're
saying
is
that
they
spear-fished
for
years
and
now
they
won't
be
able
to
spear-fish,
i
mean,
that's
just
stating
the
obvious.
unknown
speaker
what
the
case
is
about,
but--
unknown
speaker
--mr.
slonim,
have
they
been,
say,
spear-fishing
in
the
spring
over
a
long,
long
period
of
time
without
being
subject
to
state
regulation?
i
mean,
if
that
was
the
case,
why
was
this
action
brought?
unknown
speaker
so
it
was
never
established
one
way
or
the
other
as
to
whether
they
had
these
rights
as
between,
say,
the
state
of
minnesota
and
the
tribes.
the
tribes
said
they
did,
and
the
state
of
minnesota
said
they
didn't.
unknown
speaker
is
there
any
evidence
that
a
copy
of
the
order
was
given
to
the
respondents?
unknown
speaker
why
would
that
be?
i
mean,
that
couldn't
make
it
so
if
it
were
not
so,
and
your
theory
is
that
it
was
so
because
the
presidential
order
was
null
and
void--
unknown
speaker
--in
its
entirety.
unknown
speaker
well--
--in
what
way?
how
was
it
rejected
shortly
after--
unknown
speaker
--well,
it
was
a
two-part
thing.
it
was
the
revocation
of
the
rights
and
the
removal
order,
and
there
certainly
is
clear
evidence
that
the
government
abandoned
the
efforts
to
remove
the
tribes,
but
what
is
the
evidence
that
the
government
tried
to
revoke
in
some
fashion
the
other
part
of
the
order,
other
than
the
matter
that
you
mentioned?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
guess
we
don't
know
that.
if
it
were
a
statute,
would
we
sever
them
occasionally?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
and
would
we
not
approach
this
in
the
same
way
we
would
a
statutory
issue,
to
determine
if
it's
severable,
and
if
so,
if
something
remains?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
so
as
to
the
hunting
and
fishing,
what
evidence
do
we
look
to
to
see
if
that
was
somehow
revoked?
unknown
speaker
well,
you
say
all
the
evidence.
i
mean,
can
you
name
some,
or--
unknown
speaker
--well,
but
the
fact
that
they...
they
could
hunt
and
fish
the
same
way
anybody
else
in
the
territory
of
minnesota
could
hunt
without
these
rights.
unknown
speaker
well,
you're
saying--
--well,
but...
it's
assuming
the
whole
point
in
issue.
unknown
speaker
you're
saying
it
doesn't
even
have
any
purpose
as
assisting
removal.
since
they
could
hunt
and
fish
the
way
anybody
else
could,
and
in
those
days
anybody
else
could
fish
and
hunt
ad
libitum,
i
fail
to
see
how
revoking
their
hunting...
how
revoking
their
special
hunting
and
fishing
rights
would
assist
in
their
removal,
so
long
as
they
could
hunt
and
fish
the
way
justice
souter
could,
and
he
could
fish
and
hunt
to
his
heart's
content.
how
did
the
removal
of
the
hunting
and
fishing,
the
special
indian
hunting
and
fishing
rights,
assist
the
removal.
i
don't
see
that.
unknown
speaker
you're
saying
it's
a
logical
necessity,
but
i--
unknown
speaker
--you
know,
your
briefs
seem
to
say
that
it
was...
that
the
purpose
of
it
was
to
coerce
them
to
remove,
but
it
wouldn't
have
coerced
them
to
remove
at
all,
because
they
could
continue
to
exercise
the
normal
white
person's
right
to
hunt
and
fish,
and
that
would
have
been
enough.
unknown
speaker
this
is
your
notion
that
during
his
pleasure
means
one
president
says
you
can,
the
next
one
says
you
can't,
the
next
one
says
you
can?
it's
off
and
on.
unknown
speaker
okay.
article
iii,
section
1,
you're
talking
about
something
close
to
my
heart
here,
because
article
iii,
section
1
says,
the
judges
both
of
the
supreme
and
inferior
courts
shall
hold
their
offices
during
good
behavior.
does
that
mean
that
i
can
decide
to,
you
know,
just
really
be
a
really
bad
fellow
for
2
years,
and
step
down
from
the
bench,
and
then
when
i
decide
to
reform
again
i
can
come
back
on
the
bench?
unknown
speaker
during
good
behavior
means,
once
you
behave
badly
you
are
out
and
you
don't
come
back,
as
i
understand
it.
unknown
speaker
well,
mr.
slonim,
are
you
resting
your
argument
here
simply
on
the
language
of
the
treaty,
which
i
think
you
indicated
a
second
ago,
or
are
you
resting
your
argument
on
the
understanding
of
the
indian
parties
to
the
treaty?
unknown
speaker
all
right.
does
your
argument
go
so
far
as
to
get
to
the
point
that
i
raised
earlier
that,
in
fact,
the
understanding
of
at
the
pleasure
at
least
meant
it
would
not
be
the
president's
pleasure
to
end
it
for
a
long
time?
unknown
speaker
well,
is
it
your
position
that
in
fact
the
president...
and
i
didn't
think
it
was,
but
i
want
to
be
clear.
is
it
your
position
that
the
president
could
not
validly
have
revoked
the
hunting
and
fishing
rights
even
if
he
had
done
it,
as
it
were,
with
some
just
excuse
and
unconnected
with
any
invalid
removal
order
at
the
time
he
in
fact
issued
the
removal
order
in
1850?
in
other
words,
did
he
have
to
give
them
more
time,
whether
he
wanted
to
or
not,
because
they
understood
that
1850
would
be
too
soon?
unknown
speaker
well
then,
why
didn't
they
say
in
the
treaty,
you
know,
when
the
lands
are
needed
for
settlement,
or
when
the
indians
misbehave,
or
anything
like
that?
it
would
be
easy
to
say
that.
they
said,
at
the
pleasure
of
the
president.
unknown
speaker
it's
hard
to
conceive
of
language
that
puts
something
more
in
the
utter
discretionary
control
of
one
person
than
at
the
pleasure
of
the
president.
unknown
speaker
well,
they
signed
it.
unknown
speaker
but
there
were
missionaries
and
others
there
representing
their
interests,
and
i
assume
they
have...
i
mean,
the
notion
that
they
don't
have
a
concept
in
chippewa,
i
don't
know,
culture,
for
at
the
pleasure
of
someone
i
frankly
don't
believe.
unknown
speaker
i
don't
have
an
understanding
of
the
duration
of
a
man's
pleasure
either.
i
mean,
that's
the
whole
point.
it
doesn't
have
any
duration.
it's
whatever
he
wants.
but
they
didn't
have
a
notion
of,
at
somebody's
pleasure?
unknown
speaker
i
can't
believe
that.
unknown
speaker
thank
you,
mr.
slonim.
ms.
mcdowell,
we'll
hear
from
you.
unknown
speaker
what
do
you
mean,
the
order
never
took
effect?
i
mean,
if
it
says
the
privileges
shall
last
as
long
as
the...
at
the
pleasure
of
the
president,
and
the
president
says,
it's
no
longer
my
pleasure,
i
revoke
it,
that
would
seem
to
be
self-executing.
i
mean,
what
more
need
be
done?
unknown
speaker
well,
the
district
court
finding
is
a
matter
of
law.
i
mean,
so
that...
we
interpret
that
as
a
matter
of
law.
we're
not
bound
by
a
district
court
finding.
unknown
speaker
why
should
there
have
to
be
an
effort?
i
mean,
if
one...
if
a
treaty
says,
until
such
and
such
an
event,
then
the
event
occurs,
why
should
something
more
have
to
occur?
unknown
speaker
well,
president
taylor
died
in
1850,
the
same
year
he
revoked
the
order,
so
he
didn't
continue
to
think
about
it
for
4
years.
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
how
about
president
roosevelt's
letter
in
march
of
1938
recognizing
that
the
thing
had
been
revoked?
how
do
you
deal
with
that?
unknown
speaker
it
seems
to
me
you
take
a
very
cavalier
approach
to
president
roosevelt's
order.
he
said...
or
letter.
he
said,
we've
thought
about
this,
we've
looked
at
it,
these
rights
are
revoked,
and
you
said,
oh,
well,
he
doesn't
know...
he
didn't
know
what
happened
in
1854.
that's
what
your
argument
sounds
like
to
me.
i'm
amazed
the
government
would
take
such
a
cavalier
attitude
about
a
letter
from
the
president
of
the
united
states.
that's
an
amazing
position.
unknown
speaker
what
was
the
part
he
wasn't
informed
about?
my
understanding
is
this,
that
the
taylor,
president
taylor's
order
says,
no
hunting,
no
fishing,
go,
all
right.
that's
what
it
says.
unknown
speaker
now,
i
take
it
the
last
word,
go,
everyone
in
this
case
agrees,
or
do
they
or
don't
they?
are
we
supposed
to
consider
that
go
as
being
illegal
of
no
effect,
because
the
president
of
the
united
states
did
not
have
the
authority
to
say,
go?
are
we
supposed
to
take
it
as
a
given,
because
all
that
people
seem
to
be
arguing
is
severability,
not
whether
that
basic
idea
is
valid
or
not,
so
i'm
supposed
to
take
it
that
go
was
not
valid,
everybody
concedes
that,
or
what?
unknown
speaker
no,
obviously
you're
not
con...
you
think
the
go
was
invalid,
is
that
right?
unknown
speaker
or
that
it
was
somehow
revoked
by
implication.
that
was
the
gist
of
what
i
got
out
of
the
briefs,
that
the
go
part
of
the
order
by
implication
was
abandoned
or
revoked.
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
i'm
trying--
unknown
speaker
--that's
your
argument,
not
that
it
was
illegal
in
the
first
place
for
the
president
to--
unknown
speaker
--all
right.
in
other
words,
the
go
is
not
legally
valid.
it
doesn't...
i
don't
know
how
else
to
say
this.
unknown
speaker
and
therefore
what
was
attached
to
it
also
became...
is
it
your
position
that
at
the
pleasure
of
the
president
is
this
on-again,
off-again
thing,
depending
on,
you
know--
unknown
speaker
--you
can
have
a
new
president
comes
in,
you
cannot
fish
now.
unknown
speaker
it's
going
to
make
it
difficult
for
the
people
of,
you
know,
wisconsin
to
know
what's
going
on
here,
but
is
that
the
government's
position,
the
president
can
turn
it
on
and
off?
unknown
speaker
off
is
off.
unknown
speaker
okay.
unknown
speaker
so
then
it
must
be
the
government's
position
that
if
you
have
what
you
might
call
an
irrevocable
provision,
no
more
hunting
and
fishing
once
he
says
it
can't
be
changed,
and
you
attach
that
irrevocable
provision
to
a
revocable
one,
namely,
go,
the
president
can
change
his
mind
about
go
and
say,
oh,
i
changed
my
mind,
don't
go.
when
you
attach
an
irrevocable
one
to
a
revocable
one,
the
irrevocable
one
becomes
revocable.
unknown
speaker
i
don't
see
how
that
follows.
it
seems
to
me
irrevocable
is
irrevocable.
if
you've
done
it,
you've
done
it.
you
can't
pull
it
back.
i
don't
see
how
merely
attaching
it
to
a
revocable
one...
i
can
understand
how
attaching
it
to
an
invalid
one
might
render
it
invalid,
because
it's
nonseverable,
but
the
government's
taking
the
very
strange
position
that
the
order
to
go
is
not
invalid
and
therefore
it
doesn't
invalidate
the
revocable
portion.
unknown
speaker
or
the
irrevocable,
but
rather
renders
the
irrevocable
portion
revocable.
i
can't
understand--
unknown
speaker
--ms.
mcdowell--
unknown
speaker
--but
he
doesn't
have--
unknown
speaker
--but
i
thought
you've
conceded
that
he
can't
change
his
mind.
i
thought
you've
conceded
that
once
the
president
says,
no
more
hunting
and
fishing,
he
can't
come
back
a
month
later
and
say,
you
know,
that
was
a
really
bad
idea,
okay,
you
can
hunt
and
fish
again.
i
thought
you
conceded
that.
unknown
speaker
so
it
can
be
changed.
it
is
off-again,
on-again,
whatever
the
president
wants
to
do.
unknown
speaker
leave
removal
aside.
unknown
speaker
leave
removal
aside.
it's
just
an
order,
indians
can't
hunt
and
fish.
is
it
your
position
that
the
president
can
change
his
mind
and
say,
oh,
that
was
a
mistake,
i
shouldn't
have
said
that,
you
can
hunt
and
fish?
can
the
president
do
that?
unknown
speaker
no,
no.
i
mean,
yes
or
no.
[laughter]
do
you
have
a...
yes
or
no.
unknown
speaker
well,
are
you
then
saying
that
the
reason
this
seems
to
be
an
on-again,
off-again
kind
of
regime
boils
down
to
the
fact
that,
at
least
in
the
circumstances
of
this
treaty,
in
order
for
the
president
in
effect
to
exercise
his
pleasure
to
end
the
rights,
he
had
to
do
it
in
an
effective
way,
such
that
simply
signing
a
piece
of
paper
saying,
stop,
is
not
enough?
are
you
saying
that
he
had
to
communicate
it
and
enforce
it,
and
that
that
enforcement
would
in
effect
be
the
communication
to
the
people
involved,
that
he
did
not
do
that
and
he
did
not
do
that
for
the
simple
reason
that
he
could
not
enforce
the
other
order,
either?
is
that
what
it
boils
down
to,
that
he
never
really
exercised
his
pleasure
because
he
never
carried
it
through
to
the
point
of
making
it
clear?
unknown
speaker
and
you
are
not
making
the
argument
that...
the
legal
argument
that
i
thought
the
district
court
bought,
and
the
eighth
circuit,
too...
maybe
i'm
wrong
about
that...
that
the
president
could
not,
not
that
he
did
not.
here
you're
telling
us
he
did
not.
the
president
could
not
order
the
removal
because
of
an
1830
statute
that
says
the
indians
have
to
consent
to
a
removal.
that
was
an
argument
that
i
thought
was
accepted
by
the
lower
courts,
but
you
are
not
making
that
argument.
unknown
speaker
but
it
is
the
position
of
the
united
states,
of
the
department
of
justice,
as
i
understand
it,
that
the
executive
order
of
a
president
is
not
effective
ex
opera
operando,
as
we
say,
by
its
own
force,
but
rather
somehow
must
be
enforced
before
an
executive
order
is
effective.
is
that
the
position
of
the
justice
department?
unknown
speaker
i
see.
some
executive
orders
are
immediately
effective
when
they
are
promulgated,
but
others
are
only
effective
when
they
are
sought
to
be
enforced.
is
that--
unknown
speaker
--do
we
know
how
to
distinguish
the
one
from
the
other?
unknown
speaker
i
have
never
heard
this
theory
before.
no,
i'm--
--ms.
mcdowell,
isn't
your...
i
thought
your
point
was
that
this
order's
effect,
whether
it
has
effect
or
doesn't,
is
a
question
of
the
treaty,
not
general
executive
order
law.
is
that
your
position?
and
therefore,
at
least
under
a
treaty
like
this,
in
which
the...
whatever
effect
the
order
has
is
a
creature
of
the
treaty,
not
of
general
law.
the
president
had
to
be
effective
in
what
he
did.
is
that...
i'm
putting
words
into
your
mouth,
but
i
want
you
to
tell
me
if
they
are
not
your
words.
unknown
speaker
well
now,
wait
a
minute,
because
the
treaty
says
in
article
5,
the
1837
treaty,
the
privilege
of
hunting,
fishing,
and
gathering
the
wild
rice
upon
the
lands
ceded
is
guaranteed
to
the
indians
during
the
pleasure
of
the
president
of
the
united
states.
now
that's
all
it
says.
now,
can
the
president
revoke
that,
enter
an
executive
order
saying,
it
is
no
longer
my
pleasure
that
you
shall
hunt
and
fish
and
gather
wild
rice
under
the
terms
of
the
treaty?
unknown
speaker
is
there
anything
confusing
about
that?
unknown
speaker
the
president
could
do
that.
unknown
speaker
but
you
say,
because
it
was
done
together
with
a
removal
order,
the
removal
part
of
which
was
not
enforced,
that
he
could
not
do
it,
is
that
it?
unknown
speaker
is
it
not
possible
that
a
president
would
think
that
the
revocation
should
go
forward
so
that
territorial
or
state
government
could
regulate
hunting
and
fishing
for
all?
unknown
speaker
but
that
is
certainly
possible,
that
a
president
would
think,
yes,
states
or
territories,
as
the
case
may
be,
should
regulate
hunting
and
fishing
for
all.
unknown
speaker
there's
one
respect
that
your
brief
seems
to
portray
something
that
the
argument
brought
out
isn't.
that
is,
you
said,
well,
the
president
wanted
to
do
indirectly
what
he
couldn't
do
directly.
i
thought
that
was
one
argument
that...
and
it
would
be
perverse
to
say,
they
can
stay
here,
but
they're
going
to
starve
to
death.
we've
heard
now,
everybody
seems
to
agree
that
they
wouldn't
be
prohibited
from
engaging
in
any
of
these
activities,
they
just
have
to
do
them
like
everyone
else,
so
why
did
you
in
the
brief
twice,
i
noticed,
you
said,
that
would
be
taking
away
their
sustenance,
but
that's
wrong,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
you
didn't
say
anything
about
it
not
being
clear.
you
said
the
chippewa
could
not
have
survived.
you
gave
it
that
portrayal.
unknown
speaker
that
the
effect
of
this
meant
that
they
would
starve
to
death.
unknown
speaker
they
could
stay,
and
so
one
could
say,
gee,
that
would
be
an
irrational
thing
for
a
president
to
do,
to
say
you
could
stay
but
starve
to
death.
it
wouldn't
be
so
irrational
for
him
to
say,
you
can
stay
subject
to
the
rules
that
govern
everyone
else.
unknown
speaker
do
you
have
any
indication
that
noncitizens
anywhere
were
not
allowed
to
hunt
and
fish?
unknown
speaker
in
some
states,
noncitizens
were
allowed
to
vote.
