justice
sandra
day
o'connor
this
case
comes
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
eighth
circuit.
in
1837,
several
bands
of
chippewa
indians
entered
into
a
treaty
with
the
united
states.
through
the
treaty
the
chippewa
sold
land
in
present
day
minnesota
and
wisconsin
to
the
united
states.
the
united
states
guaranteed
to
the
chippewa
the
right
to
hunt,
fish,
and
gather
on
the
ceded
land
during
the
pleasure
of
the
president.
in
1990,
the
chippewa
filed
suit
against
the
state
of
minnesota
claiming
that
they
retain
this
treaty
right
today.
the
district
court
agreed
with
the
chippewa
and
the
eighth
circuit
affirmed.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
at
the
court
today,
we
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals.
the
state
argues
that
the
chippewa's
treaty
rights
were
terminated
by
any
one
of
three
events.
first,
the
state
argues
that
the
treaty
privileges
were
terminated
by
president
zachary
taylor
in
1850.
in
that
year
president
taylor
issued
an
executive
order
directing
that
the
chippewa
be
removed
from
the
ceded
lands
and
revoking
their
treaty
rights
to
hunt,
fish,
and
gather
on
the
ceded
lands.
this
court
has
previously
held
that
a
president's
power
to
issue
an
executive
order
must
come
either
from
an
active
congress
or
from
the
constitution,
but
the
state
has
pointed
to
"no
statute
or
constitutional
provision
authorizing
the
president's
order
removing
the
chippewa
from
the
ceded
lands".
because
the
president
had
no
authority
to
issue
the
removal
order,
that
portion
of
the
order
was
invalid.
the
only
question
remaining
is
whether
the
other
part
of
the
order,
the
part
revoking
the
chippewa
treaty
rights
to
hunt,
fish,
and
gather
on
the
land
is
severable
from
the
part
that
is
invalid.
we
conclude
after
an
examination
of
the
historical
record
that
the
1850
executive
order
was
meant
to
stand
or
fall
as
a
whole.
because
the
removal
order
was
invalid
and
because
the
removal
order
and
the
revocation
of
the
treaty
rights
were
inseverable,
the
1850
order
in
its
entirety
was
invalid,
and
did
not
terminate
the
chippewa
treaty
rights.
a
president
now
or
in
the
future
may
be
able
to
revoke
the
chippewa
treaty
rights
to
hunt,
fish,
and
gather
in
accordance
with
the
terms
of
the
treaty.
what
we
hold
today
is
simply
that
the
1850
executive
order
did
not
accomplish
that
objective.
the
state
next
argues
that
the
chippewa
treaty
rights
were
terminated
by
an
1855
treaty
between
certain
chippewa
bands
and
the
united
states.
the
1855
treaty,
however,
did
not
mention
the
1837
treaty,
and
did
not
mention
the
termination
of
any
previously
granted
treaty
rights.
the
historical
context
surrounding
the
later
treaty
demonstrates
that
it
was
designed
to
have
the
united
states
purchase
additional
chippewa
land
and
not
to
terminate
the
hunting,
fishing,
and
gathering
rights
granted
in
the
earlier
treaty.
finally,
the
state
contends
that
the
chippewa's
hunting,
fishing,
and
gathering
rights
were
terminated
when
minnesota
was
admitted
to
the
union
in
1858.
when
new
states
are
admitted
to
the
union
they
are
admitted
on
equal
footing
with
the
original
13
states.
in
other
words,
they
are
admitted
with
the
same
attributes
of
state
sovereignty
enjoyed
by
the
original
13
states.
in
a
case
decided
in
1896,
ward
versus
race
horse,
this
court
held
that
certain
indian
treaty
rights
were
terminated
when
wyoming
was
admitted
to
the
union.
the
race
horse
court
held
that
because
the
treaty
rights
in
that
case
where
temporary
and
precarious,
it
was
clear
that
the
congress
intended
those
treaty
rights
to
terminate
upon
statehood.
but
there
is
no
evidence
in
this
case
of
congressional
intent
for
the
chippewa
treaty
rights
to
terminate
when
minnesota
entered
the
union.
moreover,
subsequent
decisions
of
this
court
have
qualified
the
race
horse
court's
holding
that
indian
treaty
rights
are
automatically
terminated
on
statehood.
indian
treaty
rights
can
coexist
with
state
management
of
natural
resources,
and
in
fact
the
states
retain
the
power
to
regulate
the
exercise
of
indian
treaty
rights
when
necessary
for
the
conservation
of
wildlife.
