ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
chippewa
retained
the
privilege
under
the
1837
treaty
to
fish,
hunt,
and
gather
within
the
portion
of
the
minnesota
territory
ceded
by
that
treaty.
although
the
1850
order
stated
that
the
chippewa
were
required
to
remove
from
the
ceded
territory
and
could
no
longer
exercise
their
usufructuary
privilege
there,
that
order
never
took
effect.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
if
that
was
all
that
was
in
the
order,
and
if
that
was
all
that
happened,
we
might
agree
with
you,
but
that's
not
the
case.
it
was
part
of
an
order
that
was
designed
for
the
sole
purpose,
as
the
district
court
found,
to
remove
the
chippewa.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
certainly
not,
your
honor,
but
there
was
no
effort
to
enforce
the
usufructuary
revocation
separately
from--
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
--because
the
president
under
a
treaty
such
as
this
one,
that
allows
him
to
exercise
his
pleasure
with
respect
to
the
existence
of
these
rights,
certainly
has
the
ability
to
think
about,
as
he
is
carrying
the
policy
into
effect,
whether
in
fact
these
rights
ought
to
be
revoked,
and
it
was
clear
as
time
went
on
over
the
2,
3,
or
4-year
period
after
the
order
was
issued,
that
the
president,
the
executive
and
congress
did
not
want
the
chippewa
to
be
removed.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
no,
certainly
not,
but
his
successors
did.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
well,
as
we
explained
in
our
brief,
your
honor,
that
statement
doesn't
reflect
any
consideration
of
the
context
in
which
the
order
was
issued,
and
what
occurred
afterward.
it
particularly
does
not
take
into
account
the
1854
and
1855
treaties,
which
created
a
new
state
of
affairs
in
the
minnesota
ceded
territory
that
was
entirely
different
from
that
contemplated
by
the
1850
order.
whereas
the
1850
order
had
required
the
chippewa
to
remove,
the
1854
and
1855
treaties
created
what
were
said
to
be
permanent
homes
for
them
within
that
new
territory,
and
it
was
clear
because--
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
--well,
certainly,
your
honor,
president
roosevelt's
statement
is
entitled
to
a
certain
amount
of
deference,
but
he
was
not
entirely
informed
about
the
situation.
if
he
had
been,
we
don't
know
what
position
he
would
have
taken.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
uh-huh.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
we
are
not
conceding
that,
your
honor,
but
we
don't--
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
--no,
your
honor.
our
position
is
that
the
go
never
became
effective
because
it
was
never
carried
out.
that's
consistent
with--
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
--it
was
abandoned
or
revoked--
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
--before
it
took
effect.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
that's
our
position.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
it
is
of
no
effect
because
it
was
not
carried
out.
if
you
look
at--
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
--no,
your
honor--
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
--if
the
removal
happened--
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
--no,
your
honor.
if
the--
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
--removal
had
been
fully
carried
out
and
the
rights
had
been
revoked
and
the
chippewa
were
told
that
they
could
not
go
back
there
to
hunt
and
fish,
we
would
say
that
would
be
final.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
it
would
take
an
act
of
congress
reinstate
the
rights
then.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
yes,
in
the
context
of
what
was
going
on
here,
which
was
an
order
which
was
solely
designed
for
the
purpose
of
removing
the
chippewa,
not
for
revoking
their
usufructuary
rights
while
they
remained
in
place.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
it
would
be
an
even--
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
--it
would
be
an
even
stranger
position,
your
honor,
if
we
were
to
say
that
the
president
had
no
ability
to
change
his
mind,
that
once
he
decided
that
removal--
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
--the
purpose
of
the
order
was
not
to
be
carried
out--
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
--but
he
couldn't
say
that
the
chippewa
can't--
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
--no,
we
didn't
concede
that.
my--
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
--no.
if
removal,
which
was
the
whole
purpose
of
this
order,
had,
in
fact,
been
carried
out--
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
--then
at
that
point
these
rights
could--
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
--if
that
was
all
there
was
to
this
order,
perhaps
so,
perhaps
not,
but
that
was
not
all
that
there
was
to
this
order.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
if
it's
part
of
an
order
that
was
never
enforced,
the
chippewa
were
not
even
told
about,
the
president--
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
--yes,
your
honor.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
we're
not
making
that
argument
now.
we
did
join
in
that
argument
below.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
it
would
depend
on
the
particular
character
of
the
executive
order.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
certainly
in
the
context--
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
--it's
certainly
in
the
context
of
this
order,
that
had
one
purpose
which
was--
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
--yes,
it
is
the
particular
context
of
this
treaty--
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
--yes.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
no.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
that's
correct.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
we're
not
saying
that
he
could
not
do
it.
we're
saying
that
he
did
not
do
it
in
the
context
of
this
case,
that
the
revocation
of
rights
did
not
become
effective
because
the
removal
did
not
become
effective,
and
because
the
entire
policy
was
superseded
and
contradicted--
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
--there's
absolutely
no
evidence
of
that
in
the
record,
your
honor.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
that's
possible,
although
that
would
be
a
curious
conclusion,
because
in
the
1854
treaty
new
usufructuary
rights
were
recognized
for
the
indians
who
were
living
in
the
1854
ceded
territory,
the
territory
that
was
newly
ceded
by
that
treaty.
it
would
seem
curious
that
the
president
and
the
administration
wanted
to
give
indians
those
rights
in
that
part
of
minnesota
but
not
to
allow
them
to
continue
to
exercise
those
rights
in
the
remainder
of
minnesota
that
had
originally
been
part
of
the
1837
ceded
territory.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
we
don't
think
that
it's
at
all
clear
that
the
indians
would
have
had,
as
one
of
the
justices
referred
to,
a
white
man's
privilege
to
hunt
and
fish
if
the
treaty
right
were
indeed
effectively
revoked.
the
indians
were
not
citizens
of
the
states,
territories
of
the
united
states
at
the
time.
there
was
no
general--
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
--yes.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
yes.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
but
he
didn't
say
that,
and
there's
no
indication
that
the
chippewa
would
have
been
recognized
as
having
the
rights
of
citizens.
certainly--
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
--well,
there
is
indication
that
a--
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
--in
1858,
when
minnesota
began...
became
a
state,
it
enacted
hunting
and
fishing
regulations
that
among
other
things
tried
to
prevent
indians
from
leaving
the
reservations
to
hunt
and
fish
without
a
passport.
