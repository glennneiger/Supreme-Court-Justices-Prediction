mr.
william
b.
mallin
yes
sir,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
right
to
be
free
of
false
advertising
is
not
a
property
right
protected
by
the
fourteenth
amendment.
thus,
the
1992
amendment
to
the
lanham
act
that
purported
to
abrogate
sovereign
immunity
of
the
states
cannot
be
saved
by
the
fourteenth
amendment.
this
was
the
position
accepted
by
the
court
of
appeals,
by
the
district
court,
and
concurred
in
by
the
solicitor
general.
what
petitioner
csb
claims
is
that
property
is
some
loss
of
revenue
that
could
occur
as
a
result
of
the
alleged
false
advertising.
this
is
rather
new--
mr.
william
b.
mallin
--i
think
the
use
of
property
in
the
sherman
act
is
for
particular
antitrust
purposes.
its
use
in
the
fourteenth
amendment
has
a
constitutional
dimension
which
has
been
spelled
out
in
the
jurisprudence
of
this
court.
mr.
william
b.
mallin
yes,
and--
mr.
william
b.
mallin
--in
the
sense
that
that
person
has
a
claim
for
the
injury,
but
the
question
is
whether
this
property,
this
revenue
that's
never
been
received,
and
the
only
way
you
could
recover
damage
is
by
showing
false
advertising,
causation,
the
fact
of
damages,
and
damages
with
a
reasonable
certainty
is
all
contingent,
and
that
kind
of
a
right,
a
right
to
be
free
of
false
advertising
for
fourteenth
amendment
purposes,
hasn't
been
looked
upon
by
property.
on
march
3,
this
court
decided
american
manufacturers
insurance
v.
sullivan,
where
in
the
context
of
workman's
compensation
benefits
in
the
state
of
pennsylvania
a
beneficiary
who
had
already
been
determined
to
be
eligible
was
held
not
to
have
a
property
right
in
the
continuation
of
payment
of
medical
expenses
because
there
was
a
requirement
that
the
medical
expenses
had
to
be
necessary
and
reasonable,
and
that
had
to
be
determined
later,
so
that
that
kind
of
property
doesn't
raise
a
fourteenth
amendment
problem.
otherwise--
mr.
william
b.
mallin
--goodwill
is
likely
to
be
property.
mr.
william
b.
mallin
if
goodwill
is
taken
away--
mr.
william
b.
mallin
--destroyed,
which
is
a
hard
concept
to
grab
a
hold
of,
i
think
that
there
would
be
a
problem
of
turning
the
tort
that
was
involved
into--
mr.
william
b.
mallin
--i
think
if
one's
goodwill
has
been
destroyed,
it
is
likely
the
person
has
been
deprived
of
property.
mr.
william
b.
mallin
no.
there
is...
clearly
was
destruction
of
goodwill.
mr.
william
b.
mallin
the
allegation
here
is
that
florida
prepaid
misdescribed
its
own
property
and
as
a
result,
says
the
plaintiff
in
the
case
below,
i
lost
some
business
that
i
would
have
gotten,
some
revenue
that
i
would
have
gotten,
for
which--
mr.
william
b.
mallin
--there
would
be
a
tort
claim
for
damages.
mr.
william
b.
mallin
yes.
it's
usually
thought
of
as
a
loss
of
profits,
and
future
profits,
which
have
an
element
of
speculation
in
them,
which
is
quite
different
from
the
kind
of
property
rights
that
this
court
has
found
on
a
case-by-case
basis
in
its
jurisprudence
under
the
fourteenth
amendment.
if
we
pause
to
consider
the
effect
of
treating
this
kind
of
a
right
as
a
property
right
under
the
fourteenth
amendment,
then
the
fourteenth
amendment
becomes
a
wide
charter
for
legislation
on
any
subject,
going
beyond
the
first
amendment,
and
really
makes
it
relatively
easy
for
the
national
government
to
abrogate
sovereign
immunity.
mr.
william
b.
mallin
when
it
comes
to
false
advertising,
unfair
competition
prong
of
the
lanham
act
and
the
amendment
to
the
lanham
act
there
were
no
findings
by
congress,
no
discussion
from
congress,
no
suggestion
that
there's
any
kind
of
problem
out
there
with
the
states
doing
this,
or
that
there's
any
inadequacy
of
remedy.
there
was
nothing
in
the
legislative
record.
there's
nothing
in
the
judicial
record.
there
is
no
reason
to
think
that
congress
is
addressing
any
kind
of
a
due
process
problem
that
relates
to
false
advertising
by
states
of
any
kind
whatsoever,
and
what
this
amounts
to
is
federalizing
the
law
of
torts
so
that...
the
law
of
business
torts
in
particular,
and--
mr.
william
b.
mallin
--pardon
me,
your
honor?
mr.
william
b.
mallin
that's
absolutely
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
william
b.
mallin
this
is
not
a
challenge
to
the
constitutionality
of
the
lanham
act.
mr.
william
b.
mallin
of
eleventh...
through
the
eleventh
amendment.
mr.
william
b.
mallin
we're
not
even
challenging
whether
the
law
applies
to
the
states.
there
could
be
ex
parte
young
to
enforce
it.
what
we're
challenging
is
that
there
is
not
a
basis
to
abrogate
the
fourteenth
amendment.
mr.
william
b.
mallin
well,
the
argument
in
the
case
of
the
trademark
would
be
a
different
set
of
arguments.
the
trademark
area,
again
there's
no
showing
of
lack
of
remedies
at
the
state.
you
don't
have
a
due
process
problem
just
by
interfering
with
property.
mr.
william
b.
mallin
there
must
be
lack
of
revenue.
mr.
william
b.
mallin
well,
i'm
sure
they
did,
and
at
the
time
they
passed
the
legislation
it
was
before
seminole
tribe.
mr.
william
b.
mallin
and
congress
was
under
the
impression
that
under
the
commerce
clause
they
could
simply
abrogate
it.
mr.
william
b.
mallin
and
that's
what
they
tried
to
do.
mr.
william
b.
mallin
yes,
but
the
reason
had...
the
reasons
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
constitutional
dimensions--
mr.
william
b.
mallin
--of
the
eleventh
amendment.
mr.
william
b.
mallin
well,
i
don't
think
this
court
has
required
findings
from
congress.
findings
can
be
very
helpful
if
there
is
the
right
kind
of
findings
to
know
which
way
to
go.
mr.
william
b.
mallin
but
there's
got
to
be
a
basis--
mr.
william
b.
mallin
--yes.
mr.
william
b.
mallin
no.
there
has
to
be
a
basis
for
what
it's
doing.
mr.
william
b.
mallin
on
that...
first
of
all,
on
the
property
right,
since
there's
no
property
right,
yes,
i
would
argue
that
they're
without
par,
and
since
the
record
shows
that
there
are
remedies
on
the
state
level,
i
would--
mr.
william
b.
mallin
--well,
if
congress
had
found
there
were
no
remedies
and
there
were
no
remedies,
and
deference
is...
congress
is
entitled
to
deference
on
its
findings--
mr.
william
b.
mallin
--yes.
in
that
case,
it
indicated
that
congress
has
discretion,
and
the
fact
that
they
had
some
findings
would
be
significant,
but
in
the
end
congress
can't
change
the
constitution
to
redo
what
the
remedy
is,
and
if
there's
a
constitutional
wrong
the
remedy
has
to
have
a
proportionality
and
congruence
to
what
the
alleged
constitutional
wrong
is.
now,
in
the
false
advertising,
there's
no
indication
that
there's
any
problem
whatsoever
from
the
congress,
or
from
the
literature,
or
on
any
basis.
mr.
william
b.
mallin
with
all
respect,
justice
ginsburg,
i
do
not
see
that
anomaly.
sovereign
immunity
for
foreign
countries
i
believe
is
a
matter
of
the
will
of
congress
that
could
be
created
on
whatever--
mr.
william
b.
mallin
--well,
the
point
i'm
making,
it
is
not
constitutional,
so
congress
could
massage
it
the
way
it
wanted
to.
foreign
governments
are
not--
mr.
william
b.
mallin
--your
honor,
i
would
tend
to
think
that
congress
made
a
policy
decision
there
with
regard
to
foreign
governments.
the
eleventh
amendment
covers
states.
states
are
covered
by
it
as
a
constitutional
matter,
and
there's
never
been
anything
in
the
jurisprudence
of
this
court
to
suggest
that
sovereign
immunity
doesn't
apply
to
states
when
states
are
doing
something
that's
arguably
commercial.
mr.
william
b.
mallin
a
suit
between
states
and
states?
mr.
william
b.
mallin
a
california
state
court?
mr.
william
b.
mallin
i
don't
think
that's--
mr.
william
b.
mallin
--that
would
depend
on
the
law
of
those
other
states.
the
eleventh
amendment
doesn't
address
that
problem.
the
eleventh
amendment
is
a
limitation
on
the
judicial
power
of--
mr.
william
b.
mallin
--the
question
of
whether
a
state
can
be
sued
in
another
state
is
first
a
question
of
state
law
and
it
might
raise
constitutional
dimensions
but
they
would
not
be
eleventh
amendment--
mr.
william
b.
mallin
--well--
mr.
william
b.
mallin
--yes.
that's...
what
i
was...
when
you
say
the
entity--
mr.
william
b.
mallin
--the
reason
for
it
is
that
the
eleventh
amendment
is
a
limitation
on
the
judicial
power
of
the
united
states,
and
it
represents
a
concern
that
the
states
had
from
the
very
beginning
of
being
hauled
into
the
courts
of
the
new
national
government
and
subjected
to
the
will
of
the
new
national
government
in
their
courts.
mr.
william
b.
mallin
well,
in
some
contexts,
yes,
it
could
be
described
as
commercial--
mr.
william
b.
mallin
--i
think
it's
a
very--
mr.
william
b.
mallin
--well,
the
suit
that
created
the
great
controversy
was
a
suit
on
a
note,
on
a
debt.
mr.
william
b.
mallin
right.
that
was
one
of
the
great
worries,
but
the
eleventh
amendment
has
never
been
so
limited,
and--
mr.
william
b.
mallin
--my
view
is,
i
don't
know
where
this
court
may
draw
the
line.
mr.
william
b.
mallin
the
line
that
this
court
has
drawn
so
far,
the
line
it
drew
in
the
parden
case,
as
modified,
is
a
line
of
sometimes
called
poor
government
functions.
this
case
involves
education.
mr.
william
b.
mallin
well--
mr.
william
b.
mallin
--they
don't
waive
it
simply
by
going
into
the
proprietary
business.
there
has
to
be
some
statutory
setup.
mr.
william
b.
mallin
they'll
have
to
provide
something
that's--
mr.
william
b.
mallin
--what
i'm
trying
to
do
is
to
say
one
must
be
careful
about
government
activities
too
quickly
to
say
they're
proprietary.
in
the
modern
state,
for
example,
in
education,
funding
education
involves
all
kinds
of
programs.
mr.
william
b.
mallin
yes,
i
have
no
problem
with
staying
that
that's
beyond
state
activities
that--
mr.
william
b.
mallin
--no,
i
don't
find
that
in
the
eleventh
amendment.
i'm
drawing
that
from
the
jurisprudence
of
your
court--
mr.
william
b.
mallin
--up
until
now.
mr.
william
b.
mallin
no,
i
made
no
such
suggestion.
mr.
william
b.
mallin
no,
the
fourteenth
amendment--
mr.
william
b.
mallin
--there
is
two
issues,
one
is
parden,
and
one
is
the
fourteenth
amendment.
i
thought
we
were
talking
about
parden.
mr.
william
b.
mallin
the
implied
waiver.
i
have
never
suggested
in
any
way
that
under
the
fourteenth
amendment,
section
5,
that
this
line
of
government
function
and
non-government
function
has
anything
to
do
with
it.
the
question
there,
is
there
property,
and
i
think
there's
not
here,
and
is
there
due
process
of
law
in
the
state.
mr.
william
b.
mallin
which
i
think
there
is
there.
mr.
william
b.
mallin
no.
mr.
william
b.
mallin
no,
i
do
not,
and
we
haven't--
mr.
william
b.
mallin
--got
to
that
point.
many
lower
courts...
strike
many.
a
number
of
lower
courts
have
concluded
that
parden
didn't
survive
seminole
tribe.
mr.
william
b.
mallin
some
have
questioned
it.
mr.
william
b.
mallin
on...
i'm
sorry,
your
honor.
on
the
fourteenth
amendment
i
wasn't
suggesting
that
there's
any
line
to
be
drawn
between
commercial,
so-called
commercial
activities
of
the
state
or
other
activities
of
the
state.
that's
simply
an
issue
of
whether
the
state
has
taken
property,
interfered
with
property,
so
there
must
be
property
involved,
and
whether
the
state
has
provide
due
process,
there
must
be
due
process
involved,
so--
mr.
william
b.
mallin
--unless
it's
taken
property.
it's
got
to
go
to
a
property
right
under
normal
business
torts.
mr.
william
b.
mallin
no,
your
honor,
i
don't
think
so.
mr.
william
b.
mallin
i
want
to
be
sure
i
understand
the
hypothetical,
your
honor.
mr.
william
b.
mallin
yes.
that
would
be
a
violation
if
the
state
burned
property
of
its
competitors.
it
would
be
taking
that
property.
you
still
have
the
question
of
whether
there
was
a
due
process
right
in
the
judiciary
of
the
state
presumably,
if
state
agents
burn
somebody
else's
property,
and
every
state
that
i
know
of
you
can
bring
a
suit
in
a
state,
in
the
state
courts
and
get
full
compensation--
mr.
william
b.
mallin
--so
the
state
is
not
denying
due
process
at
all.
mr.
william
b.
mallin
the
national
government
has--
mr.
william
b.
mallin
--congress
has
discretion,
but
that
discretion
can't
change
the
fact
that
if
the
state
provides
due
process
of
law
so
that
the
individual
whose
bar
was
burned
could
bring
a
suit
in
the
state
court
and
obtain
full
compensation,
the
state
has
not
deprived
property
without
due
process
at
all.
mr.
william
b.
mallin
yes.
if--
mr.
william
b.
mallin
--yes,
your
honor,
if
it's
well-established
that
the
state
takes
property
and
doesn't
have
a
remedy
for
it,
that
that's
lack
of
due
process
of
law.
in
a
taking
case
every
state
is
required
to
have--
mr.
william
b.
mallin
--yes,
where
the
state
has
denied
due
process
of
law,
but
there's
nothing
in
this
record--
mr.
william
b.
mallin
--yes.
the
constitution
requires
in
a
taking
case
that
the
state
have
a
remedy,
inverse
condemnation.
if
that
remedy
is
not
adequate
there
can
be
certiorari
to
this
court
directly
out
of
that
proceeding.
mr.
william
b.
mallin
yes.
i'm
assuming
that
it
would
not
be
because
of
the
requirement,
the
constitutional
requirement
that
that
remedy
be
provided.
mr.
william
b.
mallin
no.
i--
mr.
william
b.
mallin
--yes.
my
first
position
is
that
parden
is
inconsistent
with
seminole
tribe,
and
that
this
court
should
take
this
occasion
to
recognize
that
and
overrule
parden.
that's
my
first
position.
mr.
william
b.
mallin
if
we
have
an
eleventh
amendment
issue,
on
the
eleventh
amendment
the
state
cannot
be
sued
unless
it
denies
due
process
or
it
has
a
voluntary
amendment.
the
federal
government
is
not
without
remedies.
the
federal
government
can
sue.
the
federal
government
can
pass
a
spending
statute
and
require
certain
things
that
relate
to
that
spending
statute
to
be
done
by
the
state,
an
individual
can
use
ex
parte
young
to
put
a
stop
to
that
activity,
so
we're
not
saying
that
federal
law
can
just
be
ignored,
but
the
private
suit
by
a
private
individual
for
money
damages
is
prohibited
by
the
eleventh
amendment,
and
it
should
not
be
allowed
on
the
basis
of
a
legal
fiction
that
there's
been
a
waiver
when
there
really
hasn't
been
a
waiver.
mr.
william
b.
mallin
in
a
situation
where
the
waiver
is
demanded,
the
waiver
is
the
same
as
abrogation.
mr.
william
b.
mallin
well,
the
state
has
its
own
sovereign
immunity
principles,
and
when
i
say
eleventh
amendment
i'm
talking
about
the--
mr.
william
b.
mallin
--entire
bundle
that
this
court
has
read
into
the
eleventh
amendment.
mr.
william
b.
mallin
well,
i
think
the
eleventh
amendment,
as
interpreted
by
this
court,
includes
a
full
bundle
of
sovereign
immunity,
so
that
would
be
taken
