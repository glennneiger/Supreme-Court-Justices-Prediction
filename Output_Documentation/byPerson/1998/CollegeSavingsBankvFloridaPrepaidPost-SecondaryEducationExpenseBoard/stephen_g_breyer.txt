justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
am
going
to
add
a
little
bit
about
certain
amount
of
disagreement
that
we
have
here.
my
dissent
which
as
you
heard
that
justices
stevens
and
souter
and
ginsburg
have
joined
makes
two
basic
points.
the
first
point
is
even
if
we
accept
the
majority’s
position
in
seminole
tribe,
and
remember
that
was
the
position
basically
that
congress
doesn’t
have
the
power
under
article
i
when
it
regulates
states
to
say,
and
you
have
to
let
private
citizens
sue
you.
congress
lacks
that
power.
well,
even
if
we
were
to
accept
that,
we
still
in
our
opinion,
which
is
the
minority
opinion
here,
we
still
think
that
the
court
should
not
overrule
the
case
that
was
mentioned,
parden.
when
a
state
engages
in
activity
from
which
it
could
easily
withdraw,
for
example,
when
it
acts
just
like
a
private
business,
congress,
we
think,
must
have
the
power
to
regulate
the
state
as
if
it
were
a
private
business.
otherwise,
we
would
threaten
the
ability
of
congress
to
exercise
its
most
important
commerce
power;
namely
the
power
to
regulate
private
commerce.
in
today’s
world
virtually
every
nation,
every
nation
is
open
to
suit
when
it
acts,
not
like
a
government,
but
like
a
private
business.
for
the
court
today
to
overrule
parden
and
to
hold
that
congress
doesn’t
have
the
power
to
require
states
to
do
the
same
thing
creates
a
serious
practical,
as
well
as
a
legal
anomaly.
now
second,
we
in
the
minority
are
not
yet
ready
to
accept
the
position
that
the
court
took
three
years
ago
in
seminole
tribe.
justice
stevens
and
justice
souter
in
that
case
and
again
today
in
their
opinions,
in
my
view,
show
that
neither
history
nor
precedent
support
the
majority’s
position.
i
would
add
simply
that
the
problems
of
federalism
today
that
are
important
for
ordinary
citizens
do
not
concern
sovereign
immunity,
they
concern
local
democracy
and
the
need
to
maintain
decentralized
power.
sovereign
immunity
is
an
ancient
doctrine
which
finds
a
more
congenial
home
in
the
mind
of
king
james
i
than
in
that
of
james
madison,
and
it
has
little
to
do
with
either
of
those
modern
important
federalists
decentralizing
needs.
in
so
far
as
the
majority’s
position
has
a
practical
affect,
it
will
make
it
more
difficult
to
write
laws
that
respect
the
need
to
decentralize
legal
power.
thus,
in
terms
of
federalism’s
important
liberty
protecting
objectives
related
to
local
democracy,
we
fear
that
the
seminole
tribe
majority
position
will
prove
beside
the
point
at
best,
at
worst
it
will
prove
counterproductive.
