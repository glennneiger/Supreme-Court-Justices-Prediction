unknown
speaker
the
solicitor
general
doesn't
agree
with
you
on
this
point,
i
take
it.
unknown
speaker
that
doesn't
mean
you're
necessarily
wrong,
certainly.
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
in
your
view,
mr.
todd,
was
this
property
right
created
by
congress
in
the
lanham
act?
unknown
speaker
well,
supposing
congress
had
never
passed
the
lanham
act
but
just
felt
that
organizations
such
as
yours
were
put
at
a
considerable
disadvantage
by
the
sovereign
immunity
doctrine
of
the
states.
could
congress
have
stepped
in
and
said
these
are
property
rights
created
by
state
law
but
we
don't
think
the
states
adequately
protect
even
when
they
have
sovereign
immunity?
unknown
speaker
but
you're
in
trouble,
i
think,
if
you
say
it's
based
on
interstate
commerce,
because
we've
held
that
congress
can't
abrogate
sovereign
immunity
under
it's
commerce
power.
unknown
speaker
is
it
your
position
that
congress
passed
this
1992
act
to
enforce
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment?
unknown
speaker
and
therefore
they
must
have
concluded
that
the
invocation
of
sovereign
immunity
denied
your
clients
their
property
without
due
process
of
law.
unknown
speaker
well,
mr.
todd,
that
assumes,
i
take
it,
that
the
right
to
be
free
from
unfair
competition
is
a
property
right
to
be
protected.
unknown
speaker
but
it
certainly
is
not
like
any
traditional
property
right.
can
you
sell
that
right,
do
you
suppose?
unknown
speaker
well,
can
you
exclude
others
from
a
right
to
unfair
competition?
i
mean,
it's
so
far
removed
from
anything
we
would
think
of
as
a
property
right.
the
mere
fact
that
unfair
competition
might
hurt
the
business
or
cause
economic
harm
has
never
been
thought
to
create
a
property
right.
every
tort
would
do
that,
every
zoning
regulation--
unknown
speaker
--would
affect
the
business
economically.
unknown
speaker
but
those
things
were
all
things
that
belonged
to
the
person
asserting
the
right.
in
your
presentation
you
said
that
the
right
to
do
business
is
a
property
right.
i'm
prepared
to
concede
that,
but
nothing
has
stopped
your
client
here
from
doing
business.
what
you're
complaining
about
is
the
fact
that
a
competitor
of
your
client
has
misrepresented
his
product.
he
has
not
even
misrepresented
your
product.
he
has
misrepresented
his
product,
and
i
find
it
very
difficult
to
understand
how
that
involves
any
property
right.
unknown
speaker
you
still
are
free
to
do
business,
as
you
always
have
been.
unknown
speaker
anything
that
takes
away
customers
takes
away
a
property
right
of
yours?
unknown
speaker
mr.
todd,
i
don't
know
anything
about
your
business,
but
there
are
a
lot
of
businesses
where
customer
lists
are
sold.
is
that
true
in
your
case?
for
example,
i
know
in
the
dairy
business
they
sell
customer
lists
all
the
time,
and
so
if
you
take
away
custom
you're
taking
away
part
of
something
that's
saleable,
but
that's
not
true
here,
i
gather.
unknown
speaker
and
is
it...
i
want
to
be
sure
of
one
other
thing.
you're
not
claiming
an
infringement
of
your
trademark?
unknown
speaker
no,
okay.
in
the
case
of
mcdaniels
v.
williams,
where
the
prisoner
falls
down
the
stairway
and
there's
a
question
of
whether
there's
a
constitutional
tort,
we
said
that
the
constitution,
and
the
fourteenth
amendment
particularly,
concerns
the
large
concerns
of
governance,
and
that
it
is
not
designed
to
supplant
tort
law.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
same
observation
could
be
made
with
reference
to
your
case.
unknown
speaker
there's
a
difference
in
negligence
and
intent,
but
the
observation
still,
it
seems
to
me,
has
force
in
this
case,
that
you're
using
the
constitution
to
make
a
constitutional
violation
out
of
what
is
generally
concerned
to
be
a
tort
that
is
actionable
within
the
concepts
of
tort
law
but
not
under
the
constitution.
unknown
speaker
that
argument
might
get
you
somewhere
if
the
claim
in
this
case
was
that
your
goodwill
had
been
taken
or
destroyed.
if
your
competitor
had
misrepresented
your
product,
i
think
that
argument
might
have
some
weight,
but
the
competitor
hasn't
done
that.
he's
misrepresented
his
product.
your
goodwill
has
not
at
all
been
affected.
you've
been
affected
in
no
way,
except
that
you
lost
customers.
unknown
speaker
it
may
be,
but
is
it
a
deprivation
of
property?
i
assume,
then,
that
if
it's
a
deprivation
of
property,
in
addition
to
being
a
tort,
it
would
be
some
sort
of
larceny.
you
ought
to
be
able
to
get
this
fellow
on
a
criminal
charge
for
misrepresenting
his
product,
because
he's
taken
away
some
of
your
property.
unknown
speaker
is
that
right,
if
it
were
possible
to
take
away
a
horse
trainer's
license,
as
you
say
it's
possible
to
take
away
your
customers?
if
it's
property,
it's
property.
unknown
speaker
this
doesn't
seem
to
me
to
be
property.
you
might
say
that
your
goodwill
is
a
sort
of
property
and,
i
suppose,
if
he
were
slandering
you,
i
could
see
that
there's
some
property
in
there,
but
he's
just
gone
off
and
is
competing
unfairly
by
misrepresenting
his
product.
unknown
speaker
mr.
todd,
i
have
a
question,
though.
are
there
not
other
remedies
that
your
client
could
have?
could
you
not
bring
an
ex
parte
young
type
injunction
against
florida
prepaid
and
say,
stop
what
you're
doing?
unknown
speaker
are
there
state
remedies
for
various
state
causes
of
action
that
could
result
in
damages
if
you're
correct?
unknown
speaker
thank
you,
mr.
todd.
general
waxman,
we'll
hear
from
you.
unknown
speaker
general
waxman,
most
constitutional
rights
where
you
talk
about
waiver,
it
requires
a
very
explicit,
fully
informed
waiver,
which
i
don't
think
what
you
just
described
would
meet
that
test,
do
you?
unknown
speaker
general
waxman,
do
you
really
think
there's
a
difference
between
what
you
call
a
unilateral
act
of
the
government,
the
government
saying,
the
state
shall
be
liable
for
any
damages
arising
from
its
operation
of
a
railroad...
unilaterally,
the
state's
liable
if
it
operates
a
railroad...
and
the
government
saying
on
the
other
hand,
the
state
shall
be
liable
for
any
damages
from
the
operation
of
a
railroad
if
it
should
operate
a
railroad--
unknown
speaker
--and
the
latter...
the
latter
said,
well,
it's
a
choice
to
the
state.
if
you
want
to
operate
a
railroad
you'll
be
liable
for
damages.
we're
not
acting
unilaterally.
you
waived
it
by
operating
a
railroad.
unknown
speaker
is
there
a
third--
--general
waxman,
i
was
surprised
that
we're
talking
throughout
about
consent,
which
is
to
some
extent
a
fiction,
and
you
didn't
make
an
argument
that
i
thought
you
might
have
made,
which
was,
there's
no
sovereign
immunity
here
at
all.
after
all,
with
respect
to
foreign
countries
we
have
a
restrictive
notion
of
sovereign
immunity,
and
if
a
foreign
sovereign
engages
in
business
they
will
be
liable
to
answer
in
our
courts.
if
we
don't
apply
that
same
notion
to
our
own
states
we
are
attributing
to
our
states
a
kind
of
super
sovereignty
that
we
don't
afford
to
any
foreign
nation,
and
that
seems
to
me
rather
strange.
unknown
speaker
this
court
didn't
develop
that
principle.
we
didn't
feel
free
ourselves
to
restrict
traditional
notions
of
sovereign
immunity,
even
as
to
foreign
countries,
much
less
as
to
states
of
the
union.
it
was
done
by
legislation
of
congress.
unknown
speaker
that
applies
to
the
united
states
as
well,
i
assume,
right?
unknown
speaker
if
you
want
to
buy
justice
ginsburg's
notion,
i
assume
it
would
apply
not
only
to
the
states
but
also
to
the
federal
government,
that
when
the
federal
government
acts
in
any
private
capacity,
it
will
be
subject
to
suit.
i'm
surprised
that
the
sg's
office
would
be
attracted
by
that...
by
that
prospect.
unknown
speaker
any
port
in
a
storm.
unknown
speaker
general
waxman--
unknown
speaker
--does
that
principle
assume
that
in
this
case
the
national
government
could
prevent
the
activity
entirely?
unknown
speaker
so
that
would
distinguish
the
case
that
we're
talking
about
from
justice
scalia's
case
then,
wouldn't
it?
unknown
speaker
there's
no
super
legislature
that
in
effect
would
be
able
to
bar
the
united
states.
unknown
speaker
but
we
don't
allow
waivers
of
constitutional
rights
whenever
the
government
has
the
ability
to
take
away
one
thing
in
exchange
for
another.
the
government
can't
say,
you
may
go
into
the
financial
market
so
long
as
you
agree
to
waive
your
right
against
self-incrimination
with
respect
to
any
activities.
unknown
speaker
but
the
condition
here
is
prohibited
by
the
constitution
as
well,
just
as
the
federal
government
has
no
power
to
coerce
testimony
against
the
defendant,
so,
also,
the
government
has
no
power
to
revoke
the
sovereign
immunity
of
the
state.
unknown
speaker
and
to
coerce
the
one
by
saying
we're
not
going
to
let
you
do...
run
a
railroad
is
no
different,
it
seems
to
me,
from
coercing
the
other
by
saying
we're
not
going
to
let
you
enter
the
financial
market.
unknown
speaker
are
you
saying
that
when
states
do
research,
that
this
is
not
governmental?
unknown
speaker
the
whole
point
of
reeves
v.
stake
was
that
it
was
a
cement
plant.
it
wasn't
a
governmental
activity.
the
state
was
engaging
in
private
business.
unknown
speaker
but
some
people
have
thought
that
states
ought
to
get
involved
in
the
market.
i
mean,
there's
a
whole
theory
of,
you
know,
socialist
economies.
now,
if
the
state
of
minnesota
should
decide
that
it's
just
as
important
for
the
state
to
take
an
active
part
in
the
management
of
businesses,
ownership
of
many
things
that
used
to
be...
and
they
think
that
that's
a
necessary
part
of
a
state's
function,
who
are
we
to
say
that
that
particular
thing
cannot
be
done.
i
don't
know
where
you
derive
out
of
the
constitution
your
line
between
traditionally
conducted
state
functions
and
state
entry
into
the
marketplace.
unknown
speaker
general
waxman,
the
law
for
a
long
time,
and
maybe
it
still
hasn't
made
a
distinction
between
governmental
functions
of
a
government
and
proprietary,
and
i
think
a
lot
of
courts
just
felt
that
didn't
work,
that
it
was
just
too
hard
to
tell
which
was
which.
doesn't
your
distinction
offer
some
of
the
same
problems?
unknown
speaker
we
do
make
it
with
respect
to
foreign
sovereigns.
that's
exactly
the
line
which
doesn't,
by
the
way,
emerge
from
congress
in
1976.
it
was
the
government's
position
for
years--
unknown
speaker
--that
there
was
no
immunity
once
you
engage
in
a
market
activity.
unknown
speaker
why--
unknown
speaker
--yes.
unknown
speaker
assuming
it's
a
short
one,
yes.
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
which--
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
thank
you,
general
waxman.
[laughter]
mr.
mallin,
we'll
hear
from
you.
am
i
pronouncing
your
name
correctly?
unknown
speaker
that's
not
an
unusual
suggestion,
is
it?
as
i
remember,
the
sherman
act
provides
that
one
who's
injured
in
his
property
can
recover
damages,
and
he's
injured
in
his
property
if
he
loses
a
lot
of
business.
why
isn't
the
word
property,
as
used
in
the
sherman
act,
right
on
what
we've
got
here?
unknown
speaker
well,
all
i'm
suggesting
is,
it's
not
a
totally
novel
thought
to
say
that
someone
whose
business
is
destroyed,
or
seriously
harmed
through
loss
of
profits,
loss
of
revenue,
loss
of
customers,
has
suffered
an
injury
to
his
property.
unknown
speaker
you
agree
with
that.
unknown
speaker
do
you
think...
may
i
ask
another
question?
do
you
think
goodwill
is
property?
unknown
speaker
and
if
so,
if
one's
goodwill
is
taken
away,
has
that
person
been
deprived
of
property?
unknown
speaker
or
destroyed.
unknown
speaker
my
question
is
very
simple.
if
one's
goodwill
been
destroyed,
has
the
person
been
deprived
of
property?
unknown
speaker
but
you
don't...
you
assert
that
didn't
happen
here.
unknown
speaker
there
was
no
trade
libel--
unknown
speaker
--it's
similar
to
a
case
under--
unknown
speaker
--similar
to
a
claim
under
the
robinson-patman
act
if
the
competing
sellers
sold
below
cost
for
a
long
period
of
time,
causing
a
plaintiff
to
lose
a
lot
of
business.
that's
sometimes
thought
of
as
a
loss
of
property,
but
you're
saying
it's
not.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
think
part
of
the
government's
argument,
your
opponent's
argument
here,
mr.
mallin,
is
that
congress
can
perhaps
write
with
a
broader
sweep
than
just
strict
definitions
of
property
previously,
along
the
lines
of
the
religious
freedom
restoration
act
that
was
involved
in
the
city
of
boerne.
were
there
findings
by
congress
here
as
to
deprivations
of
property
by
the--
unknown
speaker
--yes,
but
you
don't
question
the
power
of
congress
to
do
that
if
the
defendant
were
not
a
state.
unknown
speaker
you
do
not
question
the
power
of
congress
to
enact
this
legislation
providing
remedies
against
non-states,
against
private
defendants.
unknown
speaker
they
can
federalize
to
that
extent.
unknown
speaker
no,
just
the
application
to
the
states.
unknown
speaker
right,
and
your
argument--
unknown
speaker
--but
your
argument
would
not
apply
if
they'd
asserted
an
infringement
of
their
trademark,
would
they?
unknown
speaker
well,
is
it
your
argument
that
congress--
unknown
speaker
--is
it
your
argument
that
congress
didn't
make
the
appropriate
findings?
obviously
they
thought
there
was
some
purpose
in
the
legislation.
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
but
they
thought
there
was
a
reason
to
do
so,
or
they
wouldn't
have
passed
the
statute.
unknown
speaker
well,
they
have--
unknown
speaker
--if
you're
arguing,
though,
that
there
were
not
adequate
findings
you're
in
effect
saying
they
should
have
made
different
findings,
aren't
you?
are
you
not...
is
that
not
your
argument?
unknown
speaker
let
me
just
ask
one,
to
be
sure
i
understand--
unknown
speaker
--let
me
ask
you
a
question,
please.
unknown
speaker
if
congress
had
said,
we
have
studied
the
matter
at
great
length
and
we
think
there's
a
problem
that
florida
has
a
couple
of
hundred
patents
out
there
and
other...
there's
all
sorts
of
patent
infringement,
trademark
infringement
going
on
by
states,
because
they've
accepted
the
suggestion
that
justice
scalia
made,
they've
decided
to
go
into
business
all
over
the
place
where
they
didn't
before,
and
we
think
there's
a
real
problem,
and
therefore
we're
enacting
this
statute,
would
that
have
made
any
difference?
i
don't
think
it
would.
unknown
speaker
well,
i'm
assuming
there
was
a
basis
factually
for
what
they
did,
but
nevertheless,
wouldn't
you
argue
they're
without
power
to
take
care
of
that
problem?
unknown
speaker
it
seems
to
me
that's
totally
irrelevant,
because
you're
saying
even
if
congress
had
found
there
were
no
remedies,
the
result
would
be
the
same.
unknown
speaker
well,
in
the
city
of
boerne
case
i
think
the
court
said
that
where
congress
seeks
to
go
beyond
the
strict
coverage
of
the
amendment
itself
and
perhaps
wants
to
have...
file
a...
classified
as
enforcement
legislation,
that
the
fact
that
congress
had
found
that
there
were
a
number
of
abuses,
it
could
be
of
some
importance
in
deciding
whether
congress
could
go
that
extra
step.
unknown
speaker
mr.
mallin,
may
i
switch
you
to
the
other
prong
on
this
argument,
and
i
would
like
to
return
to
the
question
that
i
asked
general
waxman.
as
i
understand
what's
called
the
restricted
notion
of
sovereign
immunity
it
isn't
a
matter
of
consent.
it
is
a
matter
of
how
we
define
sovereign
immunity,
restricted
doesn't
include
commercial
activities,
and
that
notion
is
codified
in
the
foreign
sovereign
immunities
act.
there
is
a
certain
anomaly,
is
there
not,
to
say
that
states
are
not
suable
in
federal
court
because
of
their
sovereign
immunity
when
any
foreign
nation
would
be?
unknown
speaker
well,
congress
codified
what
had
been
a
doctrine
of
common
law,
federal
common
law
doctrine
that
had
been
around
many,
many
years
before
the
foreign
sovereign
immunities
act.
unknown
speaker
it
was
a
definition
of
what
does
sovereign
immunity
mean?
i
mean,
what...
it
all
goes
back
to,
you
can't
sue
the
king,
and
what
was
the
scope
of
that
immunity,
and
i
thought
the
idea
was,
well,
it
isn't...
doesn't
cover
everything
that
a
sovereign
does,
only
some
things.
unknown
speaker
well,
that's
true
except
when
a
state
is
in
the
court
of
another
state,
the
nevada
v.
hall
case.
does
nevada
have
sovereign
immunity
from
suit
in
a
california
court?
unknown
speaker
no,
a
suit
by
a
citizen
of
california
against
the
state
of
nevada
in
a
california
court.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
in
this
case,
for
instance,
could
the
florida
entity
have
been
sued
in
the
state
courts
of
another
state?
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
it
might
indicate
that
the
sovereign
immunity
of
the
state
is
subject
to
some
qualification.
if
the
state
could
be
sued
in
the
courts
of
another
state,
what
would
be
the
policy
against
prohibiting
suit
in
the
federal
court?
the
object
of
the
eleventh
amendment
is
the
state
ought
to
be
sued
in
its
own
courts,
if
at
all,
but
if
it
can
be
sued
in
the
courts
of
another
state,
and
there's
jurisdiction
in
that
other
state,
why
should
the
state
care
if
it
goes
to
a
federal
court
in
new
jersey
as
opposed
to
a
state
court
in
new
jersey?
unknown
speaker
well,
let
me
put
it
this
way--
--mr.
mallin,
do
you
think--
--let's
assume...
let's
assume
that
the
florida
entity
here
could
be
sued
in
a
state
court
in
the
state
of
new
jersey.
let's
assume
that.
what
is
the
interest
in
insisting
on
a
state
court
of
another
state
as
opposed
to
a
jurisdiction
of
a
federal
court?
what
would
be
the
purpose
of
that?
unknown
speaker
other
than
the
words
of
the
eleventh
amendment,
which--
unknown
speaker
--if
we
probe
the
reason
for
it--
unknown
speaker
--mr.
mallin,
do
you
think
that
lending
and
borrowing
money
can
fairly
be
described
as
a
commercial
activity?
unknown
speaker
in
any
contexts,
could
it
not?
i
mean,
isn't
most
of
the
prototypical
commercial
activity
lending
and
borrowing
money?
unknown
speaker
and
what
was
the
eleventh
amendment
directed
against,
primarily?
what
kind
of
suits
were
they
worried
about?
unknown
speaker
they
were
worried
about
suing
for
debts
that
they
had
contracted
in
order
to
fund
the
war,
isn't
that
right?
unknown
speaker
is
it
the
case
that
if
a
state
decides
it's
going
to
go
in
the
ice
cream
business
and
it
sells
shirts,
decides
to
open
their
own
coffee
bars,
run
grocery
stores,
that
federal
commercial
regulation
is
just
out
the
window
insofar
as
federal
commercial
regulation
involves
giving
individuals
who
are
hurt
private
actions
in
a
federal
court.
no
fraud
cases,
no
securities
fraud
cases,
no
antitrust
price-fixing
cases,
no
federal
trade
commission
cases.
all
those
cases,
even
though
the
states
knew...
the
new
starbucks,
they
saw
money
in
that.
[laughter]
all
federal
regulations
out,
insofar
as
it
depends
upon
private
people
who
are
hurt
bringing
causes
of
action
in
a
federal
court.
is
that
your
view?
unknown
speaker
but
all
what
line?
what
line?
i
wanted
to
know,
is
it
all
out?
your
answer
is
either
yes
or
no.
if
your
answer
is
yes,
i'm
going
to
ask
you
why
did
hamilton
and
madison
take
against
starbucks?
i
mean,
if
you're
answer's
no,
i'm
very
interested.
i
mean,
what
line?
unknown
speaker
so
you
would
say
that
if,
in
fact,
they
do
go
into
a
proprietary
field,
if
they
do
go
into
the
business,
a
business,
then
they
do
waive,
then
they
do
waive
any
rights.
then
you're
arguing
that
this
isn't
one
of
those
cases.
unknown
speaker
which
is
it
you--
unknown
speaker
--oh,
no,
no,
we'll
write
the
statute.
we'll
say,
by
the
way,
as
justice
scalia
pointed
out
right--
unknown
speaker
--at
the
beginning,
we'll
write
that
in.
[laughter]
that's
no
problem.
i
want
to
know
if
you're
going
to
defend
this
line,
nothing
proprietary,
or
if
you're
going
to
try
to
distinguish
your
case.
which
is
it?
unknown
speaker
with
starbucks,
if
they're
out
there
selling
coffee,
t-shirts,
and
bananas,
or
whatever,
then
you
have
no
problem
with
the
waiver.
unknown
speaker
where
do
you
find
that
in
the
eleventh
amendment?
i
mean,
you
just...
do
you
find
that
in
the
eleventh
amendment
somewhere?
unknown
speaker
oh,
okay.
unknown
speaker
a
lot
of
which
is
hard
to
find
in
the
eleventh
amendment.
[laughter]
but
you
are
going
to
make
it
in
effect
section
5
doctrine,
is
that
it?
the
section
5
power
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
is
basically
going
to
have
this
parden
condition
on
it,
together
with
a
commercial
activity
condition,
so
that
if
the
activity,
as
justice
breyer
said,
truly
is
commercial,
and
the
states
truly
do
have
a
choice
whether
or
not
to
get
into
it,
then
there
is
power
to
protect
property
under
section
5
and,
in
a
case
like
this,
as
he
put
it,
if
they
were
selling
coffee
rather
than
engaging
in
tuition
funding
schemes,
it
would
be
within
the
power
of
congress
to
subject
them
to
the
lanham
act.
is
that
your
position?
unknown
speaker
all
right.
now,
why
is--
unknown
speaker
--where
do
you...
you
spoke
of
drawing
a
line,
and
i
thought
you
were
conceding
that
that
might
be
the
place
to
draw
the
line.
where
do...
what
is
the
line,
and
where
would
you
draw
it?
unknown
speaker
okay.
unknown
speaker
okay.
unknown
speaker
so
you're
saying
there
is
still
a
vital
parden
exception
in
effect
to
the
limitation
announced
in
seminole,
is
that
right,
as
far
as
you
know?
parden...
you
concede
that
parden
is
good
law
if--
unknown
speaker
--you've
got
facts
to
support
it?
unknown
speaker
you
don't?
unknown
speaker
okay.
unknown
speaker
here's...
the
thing
that
i'm
trying
to
get
at
is,
i
thought
you
were
conceding
that
there
is
some
kind
of
a
line
to
be
drawn,
that
whether
we're
talking
about
eleventh
amendment
article
i
power,
or
whether
we're
talking
about
the
section
5
enforcement
power,
there
are
some
things
that
the
state
can
do
to
subject...
that
the
national
government
can
do
to
subject
the
states
to
national
regulation
like
the
lanham
act,
but
certain
conditions
have
to
be
met,
and
that
is
how
i
thought
you
were
saying
you
draw
the
line.
what
are
those
conditions,
or
did
i
misunderstand
you
completely?
unknown
speaker
so
that,
for
example,
if
the
state
does
go
into
a
starbucks
operation
and
it
becomes
very
predatory,
it's
driving
all
of
its
competitors
out
of
business,
there
is
no
power
under
section
5,
i
take
it,
under
which
the
government
might
act,
the
national
government
might
act?
unknown
speaker
it's
driving
its
competitors
out
of
business.
is
that
taking
property?
unknown
speaker
okay.
what
if
it's
hiring
thugs
to
go
in
and
burn
its
competitors'
coffee
bars
down?
any
possibility
of
federal
action
then,
under
section
5?
unknown
speaker
the
state
goes
into
the
coffee
bar
business
and
decides
a
good
way
to
increase
its
business
would
be
to
burn
the
coffee
bars
of
its
competitors.
is
there
anything
the
national
government
can
do
under
the
property
prong
of
the
fourteenth
amendment?
unknown
speaker
so
long
as--
unknown
speaker
--so
the
national
government
could
not
say,
we
have
our
doubts
about
the
effectiveness
of
that
remedy
in
the
courts
of
the
very
state
that
it's
burning
down
the
bars.
that
would
not
be
open
to
the
national
government.
unknown
speaker
that
would
not
be
a
basis
to
section
5
legislation.
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
what
if
they
do
as
some
states.
they
have
a
total
sovereign
immunity.
they
don't
provide
a
remedy.
some
states
would
not
provide
a
remedy
in
that
situation.
unknown
speaker
what
do
you
do--
unknown
speaker
--well,
given
that,
doesn't...
are
you
then
saying
in
that
situation
it
would
be
appropriate
to...
it
would
be
permissible
for
congress
to
authorize
a
suite
against
a
state
in
a
federal
court
for
damages?
unknown
speaker
i
don't
think
they
have
to
authorize
it.
wouldn't
there
be
a
constitutional--
unknown
speaker
--yes,
but
all
those
cases
are
before
our
latest
decisions.
you're
sure
the
eleventh
amendment
would
not
be
a
defense
in
those
cases.
you're
agreeing
that
that
would
not
be.
unknown
speaker
now,
as
to
the
other
line,
you
say
there
are
two
arguments,
one's
the
fourteenth
amendment,
the
other
one
is
parden.
i'm
not
sure
what
your
position
is.
do
you
favor
this
distinction
between
commercial
and
noncommercial
or
not?
unknown
speaker
you
seem
to
have
gotten
yourself
into
the
position
of
defending
it.
i
had
thought
that
you
thought
that
parden
was
gone.
unknown
speaker
in
other
words,
you're
thinking
that
hamilton
and
madison
and...
they...
if
you'd
even
asked
them,
let's
imagine
you
asked
them,
say
we
have
this
state
that's
gone
sort
of
wild
for
commercial
ventures,
and
they're
acting
not
like
a
duck,
they're
acting
like
a
business,
exactly,
identical,
but
you,
mr.
madison,
believe
that
those
same
rules
that
affect
every
other
business
of
the
united
states
that
congress
has
enacted
like
antitrust
laws
should
not
apply,
simply
because
the
name
on
the...
on
that
business,
which
is
in
every
other
respect
identical
happens
to
be
the
commonwealth
of
massachusetts
shoe
store,
or...
et
cetera.
i
mean,
let's
imagine
we
ask
the
founding
fathers.
i
mean,
why
wouldn't
they
have
said,
acts
like
a
duck,
treat
it
like
a
duck.
acts
like
a
business,
treat
it
like
a
business.
unknown
speaker
is
it
your--
unknown
speaker
--mr.
todd,
is
it
your
position
that
there
is
no
sovereign
immunity
principle
operating
here
which
is
in
addition
to
or
different
from
the
eleventh
amendment?
you've
spoken
a
number
of
times
of
the
eleventh
amendment
as
being
barred.
is
there
any
sovereign
immunity
principle
aside
from
the
eleventh
amendment?
unknown
speaker
well,
cognizable...
cognizable
in
a
federal
court.
unknown
speaker
cognizable
in
a
federal
court.
is
there
any
sovereign
immunity
principle
in
addition
to
the
terms
of
the
eleventh
amendment
that
would
be
cognizable
in
a
federal
court
as
a
state
defense?
unknown
speaker
well,
does
it
include
any
concept
of
sovereign
immunity
in
addition
to
the
strict
terms
of
the
eleventh
amendment
itself?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
well,
i'm
asking
you
how
the
court
should
interpret
it.
a
state
is
defending
a
lanham
act
suit,
say.
does
the
state
have...
and
let's
assume
section
5
is
not
involved
here
for
a
moment.
does
the
state
have
any
defense
other
than
a
defense
consisting
of
the
terms
of
the
eleventh
amendment
itself?
can
the
state,
in
other
words,
claim
a
sovereign
immunity
defense
which
is
broader
than
the
strict
terms
of
the
eleventh
amendment?
