justice
antonin
scalia
this
case
comes
to
us
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
third
circuit.
petitioner,
college
savings
bank,
is
a
new
jersey
bank
that
markets
and
sells
certificates
of
deposit
designed
to
finance
the
costs
of
college
education.
respondent,
florida
prepaid
postsecondary
education
expense
board
(fppeeb),
is
an
arm
of
the
state
of
florida
that
also
administers
a
tuition
fee
payment
program
designed
to
provide
individuals
with
sufficient
funds
to
cover
future
college
expenses.
college
savings,
the
private
bank,
filed
this
lawsuit
in
united
states
district
court
in
new
jersey,
alleging
that
florida
prepaid,
the
state
institution,
violated
section
43(a)
of
the
lanham
act
by
making
misstatements
about
its
own
tuition
savings
plan
in
its
brochures
and
in
its
annual
reports.
florida
prepaid
moved
to
dismiss
the
action
on
the
ground
that
it
was
barred
by
sovereign
immunity.
the
united
states
intervened
on
the
side
of
college
savings
to
defend
the
constitutionality
of
the
federal
legislation
that
permitted
the
suit.
the
district
court
granted
florida
prepaid’s
motion
to
dismiss,
and
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
third
circuit
affirmed.
we
granted
certiorari,
and
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
we
affirm
the
third
circuit.
section
43(a)
of
the
lanham
act
creates
a
private
right
of
action
against
the
person
who
uses
false
descriptions
or
makes
false
representations
in
commerce.
the
trademark
remedy
clarification
act
of
1992,
which
i
shall
refer
to
as
trca,
subjects
the
states
to
suits
brought
under
43(a)
of
the
lanham
act.
by
virtue
of
their
sovereign
immunity
however,
states
cannot
be
sued
by
individuals
unless
they
have
consented
or
unless
their
immunity
has
been
validly
abrogated.
thus,
the
question
presented
in
this
case
is
whether
trca
is
effective
to
permit
suit
against
the
state
for
its
alleged
misrepresentation
of
its
own
product?
either
because
trca
affects
a
constitutionally
permissible
abrogation
of
state
sovereign
immunity,
or
because
trca
operates
as
an
invitation
to
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity,
which
is
automatically
accepted
by
states
engaging
in
the
activities
in
commerce
that
are
regulated
by
the
lanham
act.
we
turn
first
to
the
contention
that
florida’s
sovereign
immunity
was
validly
abrogated.
our
decisions
in
seminole
tribe
and
fitzpatrick
versus
bitzer
make
clear
that
congress
can
abrogate
state
sovereign
immunity
when
it
legislates
to
enforce
the
fourteenth
amendment,
but
that
it
cannot
do
so
when
it
legislates
pursuant
to
its
power
to
regulate
commerce.
thus,
this
first
issue
turns
on
whether
trca
enforces
the
fourteenth
amendment.
college
savings
asserts
that
it
does,
because
it
enforces
that
provision
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
which
says
that
no
state
shall
deprive
any
person
of
property
without
due
process
of
law.
their
argument
is
that
congress
enacted
trca
to
remedy
and
prevent
state
deprivations
without
due
process
of
two
species
of
"property"
rights:
first,
a
right
to
be
free
from
a
business
competitor's
false
advertising
about
its
own
product;
and
second,
a
more
generalized
right
to
be
secure
in
one's
business
interests.
we
conclude
that
neither
of
these
qualifies
as
a
property
right
protected
by
the
due
process
clause.
as
to
the
first:
the
hallmark
of
a
protected
property
interest
is
the
right
to
exclude
others.
the
lanham
act's
false
advertising
provisions,
however,
bear
no
relationship
to
any
right
to
exclude,
and
florida
prepaid's
alleged
misrepresentation
concerning
its
own
products
intruded
upon
no
interest
over
which
petitioner
had
exclusive
dominion.
as
to
the
more
generalized
right
to
be
secure
in
one’s
business
interests,
while
a
business
assets
are
property,
and
any
state
taking
of
those
assets
is
a
"deprivation
of
property".
business
in
the
sense
of
the
activity
of
doing
business
or
the
activity
of
making
a
profit
is
not
property
at
all,
and
it
is
only
that
which
is
impinged
upon
by
a
competitor's
false
advertising.
the
second
and
more
substantial
question
in
the
case
is
whether
florida
prepaid's
sovereign
immunity
has
been
waived?
there
is
no
suggestion
here
that
florida
prepaid
expressly
consented
to
being
sued
in
federal
court.
petitioner
and
the
united
states
maintain,
however,
that
florida
has
"impliedly"
or
"constructively"
waived
its
immunity
from
lanham
act
suit.
they
make
this
assertion
on
the
authority
of
a
case
called
parden
versus
terminal
railroad
co.
of
alabama
docks
department,
which
we
decided
in
1964.
in
parden
we
permitted
employees
of
a
railroad
owned
and
operated
by
alabama
to
bring
an
action
under
the
federal
employees'
liability
act
against
their
employer.
we
held
that
alabama
had
waived
its
immunity
from
fela
suit,
even
though
alabama
law
expressly
disavowed
any
such
waiver.
our
reasoning
was,
“in
enacting
the
fela,
congress
had
conditioned
the
right
to
operate
a
railroad
in
interstate
commerce
upon
amenability
to
suit
in
federal
court
as
provided
by
the
act;
by
thereafter
operating
a
railroad
in
interstate
commerce,
alabama
was
taken
to
have
accepted
that
condition
and
thus
to
have
consented
to
suit."
only
nine
years
later
we
began
to
retreat
from
parden
and
subsequent
cases
criticized
its
holding
and
overruled
it
in
part,
the
part
overruled
was
the
part
the
fela
did
not
specifically
name
the
states,
it
just
said
anybody
can
sue
the
employer,
and
we
said
in
parden
the
employer
includes
the
states.
we
overruled
parden
nine
years
later
at
least
in
so
far
as
saying,
if
you
want
to
eliminate
state
sovereign
immunity
you
have
to
at
least
name
the
state
as
among
those
employers
who
can
be
sued.
as
we
explain
in
our
opinion
in
detail,
parden
broke
sharply
with
prior
cases,
and
is
fundamentally
incompatible
with
later
cases.
we
have
never
applied
its
holding
to
another
statute,
and
in
fact
have
narrowed
the
case
in
every
subsequent
opinion
in
which
it
has
been
under
consideration.
in
short,
parden
stands
as
an
anomaly
in
the
jurisprudence
of
sovereign
immunity,
and
indeed
in
the
jurisprudence
of
constitutional
law.
today,
we
drop
the
other
shoe:
whatever
may
remain
of
our
decision
in
parden
is
expressly
overruled.
to
begin
with,
we
cannot
square
parden
with
our
earlier
cases
requiring
that
a
state's
express
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity
be
unequivocal.
there
is
little
reason
to
assume
actual
consent,
unequivocal
consent,
based
upon
the
state's
mere
presence
in
a
field
subject
to
congressional
regulation.
there
is
a
fundamental
difference
between
a
state's
expressing
unequivocally
that
it
waives
its
immunity
and
congress's
expressing
unequivocally
its
intention
that
if
the
state
takes
certain
action
it
shall
be
deemed
to
have
waived
its
immunity.
parden
style
waivers
are
simply
unheard
of
in
the
context
of
other
constitutionally
protected
privileges.
for
example,
imagine
if
congress
amended
the
securities
laws
to
provide
that
anyone
committing
fraud
in
connection
with
the
buying
or
selling
of
securities
in
interstate
commerce
would
not
be
entitled
to
a
jury
in
any
federal
criminal
prosecution
of
such
fraud.
would
persons
engaging
in
securities
fraud
be
deemed
by
the
adoption
of
that
amendment
to
have
"constructively
waived"
their
constitutionally
protected
rights
to
trial
by
jury
in
criminal
cases?
the
answer
of
course
is
no
and
we
think
the
same
principle
applies
here.
not
surprisingly,
the
very
cornerstone
of
parden
was
the
notion
that
state
sovereign
immunity
is
not
constitutionally
grounded.
the
case
said
it
in
so
many
words.
our
more
recent
decision
in
seminole
tribe
expressly
repudiates
that
proposition,
and
in
formally
overruling
parden
we
do
no
more
than
make
explicit
what
that
case
implied.
nor
do
we
think
the
constitutionally
grounded
principle
of
state
sovereign
immunity
is
any
less
robust,
whereas
here
the
asserted
basis
for
constructive
waiver
is
conduct
that
is
undertaken
for
profit,
that
is
traditionally
performed
by
private
citizens
and
corporations,
and
that
otherwise
resembles
the
behavior
of
"market
participants".
permitting
abrogation
or
constructive
waiver
of
the
constitutional
right
only
when
these
conditions
exist
would
of
course
limit
the
evil,
but
it
is
hard
to
say
that
that
limitation
has
any
more
support
in
text
or
tradition
of
sovereign
immunity
than,
for
example,
limiting
abrogation
or
constructive
waiver
to
the
last
friday
of
the
month.
since
sovereign
immunity
itself
was
not
traditionally
limited
by
these
factors,
and
since
they
have
no
bearing
on
the
voluntariness
of
the
waiver,
there
is
no
principled
reason
why
they
should
enter
into
our
waiver
analysis.
finally,
the
united
states
points
out
that
we
have
held
in
such
cases
as
south
dakota
versus
dole,
decided
in
1987,
that
congress
may
in
the
exercise
of
its
spending
power
condition
its
grant
of
funds
to
the
states
upon
their
taking
certain
actions
that
congress
could
not
require
them
to
take,
and
that
acceptance
of
the
funds
entails
an
agreement
to
those
actions.
those
cases
seem
to
us
fundamentally
different
from
the
present
one.
congress
has
no
obligation
to
use
its
spending
clause
power
to
disburse
funds
to
the
states,
such
funds
are
gifts.
in
the
present
case,
however,
what
congress
threatens
if
the
state
refuses
to
agree
to
its
condition
is
not
the
denial
of
a
gift
or
of
a
gratuity,
but
rather
a
sanction,
exclusion
of
the
state
from
otherwise
permissible
activity.
even
in
cases
involving
conditions
attached
to
federal
funding,
we
have
acknowledged
that
the
financial
inducement
offered
by
congress
might
be
so
coercive
as
to
pass
the
point
at
which
“pressure
turns
into
compulsion”.
where
the
constitutionally
guaranteed
protection
of
the
states'
sovereign
immunity
is
involved,
the
point
of
coercion
is
automatically
passed,
and
the
voluntariness
of
waiver
destroyed
when
what
is
attached
to
the
refusal
to
waive
is
the
exclusion
of
the
state
from
otherwise
lawful
activity.
