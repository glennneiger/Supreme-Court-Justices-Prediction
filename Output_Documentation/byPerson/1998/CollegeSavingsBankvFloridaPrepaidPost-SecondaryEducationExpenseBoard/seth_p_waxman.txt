mr.
seth
p.
waxman
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
parden
v.
terminal
railway
all
nine
justices
agreed
that
at
least
where
congress
has
made
its
intent
clear
the
voluntary
participation
by
a
state
in
a
commercial
business
that
has
traditionally
been
engaged
in
not
by
states
but
rather
by
private
parties
for
profit
will
establish
consent
to
private
suits
out
of
that
business
in
federal
court.
this
case--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--i
think...
i
don't,
and
i
think
that
the...
well,
to
the
extent
that
congress
has
made
its
intent
clear
is
where
that
test
is
met.
this
court,
in
the
abrogation
context
in
atascadero
and
in
the
parden
waiver
context
in
welch
v.
texas
transportation
made
it
clear
that
in
order
for
there
to
be
a
loss
by
a
state
of
its
constitutional
eleventh
amendment
right,
the
national
legislature
must
speak
with
unmistakable
clarity.
now,
waiver
and
abrogation
are
sometimes
confused
and,
before
this
court's
decision
in
seminole
tribe,
it's
understandable
why
they
were,
but
they're
very
different
concepts,
as
we
think
this
court
recognized
in
seminole
tribe.
abrogation
is
the
unilateral
act
of
power
by
the
national
legislature,
acting
within
its
constitutional
scope.
waiver
requires
the
voluntary
consent
of
the
state,
whether
it's
waiver
by
express
language,
or
waiver
by
conduct
and,
mr.
chief
justice,
the
act
of
waiver
following
notice
must
be
such
that
it
reflects
a
voluntary
knowing
waiver
of
a
constitutional
right.
we
definitely
agree
with
that.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
that
is--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--the
test...
there
is
a
distinction
between
unilateral
abrogation
and
consent,
and
the
test
really
boils
down
to,
as
it
does
in
the
tenth
amendment
cases
this
court
has
decided,
like
ferc
v.
mississippi
and
united
states
v.
new
york,
in
terms
of
whether
the
state
is
exercising
a
genuine,
reasonable
choice
and
is
not
being
coerced.
now,
in
the
specific
context
of
the
eleventh
amendment,
where
this
court
has
always
recognized
the
viability
and
applicability
of
the
concept
of
waiver
and
consent,
this
court,
subsequent
to
parden,
in
missouri
employees
qualified
parden
in
the
way
in
which
i
just
articulated.
that
is,
it's
not
just,
if
you
run
a
railroad,
or
if
you
choose
to
run
a
railroad,
it's
that
the
parden
doctrine,
that
is,
voluntariness
will
be
imputed
and
applied
to
the
state
if
what
the
state...
if
the
activity
is
not
something
that
states
traditionally
have
done
but
instead
is
something
that
private
parties
have
done
and
for
profit.
that's
the
test
that
we
understand
this
court
substituted
for
parden
and
therefore
qualified
parden
in
missouri
employees.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
well,
i
think...
i
haven't
made
it
expressly,
but
i
think
in
the
foreign
sovereign
immunities
context
we
apply
that
rule
in
the
context
of,
it
is
a
consent.
it
is
a
waiver.
that
is,
we
have
enacted
a
law,
the
foreign
sovereign
immunities
act,
which
says...
one
of
the
elements
of
the
act
is,
if
you...
if
a
foreign
sovereign
engages
in
commercial
activity
within
the
personal
jurisdiction
and
subject
matter
jurisdiction
of
the
united
states
courts,
you
are
subject
to
those
courts,
and
it's
that
same
principle
that
applies
here.
now,
there
are--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--the
legislation
of
congress
simply
permits,
justice
scalia,
what
we
think
is
an
operation
here,
which
is
the
operation
of
a
principle
whereby
if
the
legislature
makes
clear,
unmistakably
clear,
the
conditions
under
which
engaging
in
a
truly
voluntary
activity,
commercial
activity,
the
truly
voluntary
act
of
subsequently
doing
that,
amounts
to
consent
by
conduct,
and
the
general
principle--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--excuse
me?
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
well,
we're
attracted
by
any
notion
where...
any
principle
the
logic
of
which
carries
us
to
the
result
we
think
is
just,
but--
[laughter]
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
but
i
think,
justice--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--i
think,
justice
scalia,
if
i
can
just
respond
to
you
for
a
moment,
i
think
there
are
some
important
bedrock
principles
in
the
law
that
this
court
has
recognized
that
doesn't
require
any
stretching
for
this
court
to
say
that
the
parden
doctrine
as
a
concept
of
waiver
by
consent
with
adequate
notice
and
truly
voluntary
conduct
is
not
one
that
should
be
abandoned.
there
are
perhaps
more
difficult
questions
about
whether
the
facts
of
this
case
qualify,
but
there
has
always
been
a
principle
at
the
law
that
one
may
consent
by
knowing
and
voluntary
conduct.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
i
think
you
could
never
have...
a
state
choice
would
never
be
voluntary
if
one
of
the...
you
know,
if
the
quid
was
something
that
the
government
couldn't
possibly
do.
in
other
words,
if
the
government--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--yes,
and
in
fact--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--i
think
for
me
at
least
a
useful
way
of
thinking
about
the
continuity
of
the
parden
principle
as
it's
been
qualified
following
this
court's
decision
in
union
gas
and
seminole
tribe
is
to
think
about
those
cases
themselves.
if
in
seminole
tribe,
for
example,
congress
had
said,
look,
the
supreme
court
decided
in
cabazan
band
that
states
can't
regulate
indian...
gaming
by
indian
tribes,
but
we're
going
to
allow
you
to
regulate
gaming
by
indian
tribes
so
long
as
you
consent
to
subject
to
federal
court
dispute
private
party
actions
concerning
the
conduct
of
that
regulation
and
your
own
gaming
regulation,
the
states
would
have
a
choice
to
say,
no,
no,
no,
we're
very
happy
not
regulating,
or
undertake
the
regulatory
regime.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
that's
right,
and
one
of...
for...
that's
why
one
of
the...
in
the
spending
clause
context
one
of
the
four...
the
last
of
the
four
factors
in
south
dakota
v.
dole
is,
it
can't
impose
a
condition
that
is
itself
prohibited
by
the
constitution.
but
for
example,
congress
didn't
have
the
authority
in
south
dakota
v.
dole
consistent
with
the
twenty-first
amendment
to
say
from
now
on
the
drinking
age
will
be
21.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
the--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--if
there
were
coercion
here,
justice
scalia,
i
would
agree,
but
i
think
the
facts
of
this
case
are
quite
similar
to
the
facts
in
reeves
v.
stake,
which
was
one
of
the
trilogy
of
cases
this
court
decided
under
the
market
participant
principle.
if
the
court
will
recall,
south
dakota
was
concerned
that
there
were
no
cement
producers
in
the
region
and
that
it
was
adversely
affecting
the
infrastructure
of
the
state
and
commercial
development
in
the
state.
now,
south
dakota
had
a
number
of
means
by
which
it
could
have
remedied
that.
it
could
have--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--no,
no,
not
at
all.
i'm
say...
i'm--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--right.
the
test...
the
test
that
this
court
articulated
in
those
cases
is,
is
this
a
market
participant
or
a
market
regulator.
now,
we
are
not...
the
test
that
we
advocate
under
parden
doesn't
make
that
distinction.
it's
much
narrower
than
that.
but
the
point
is
that
when
this
court
decided
the
market
participation
cases,
what
it
said
is,
because...
a
premise
of
releasing
the
state
of
south
dakota
from
what
otherwise
would
be
certain
obligations
and
restrictions
under
the
commerce
clause
if
it
were
acting
as
a
state
pursuant
to
a
core
state
function
was
that
as
a...
it
was
acting
as
a
private
participant
in
a
market
where
people
engage
in
for
profit
and
therefore...
and
this
court
said,
therefore
it
is
subject
to
the
same
benefits
and
legal
burdens
that
other
private
participants
are.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
the
entire
force
of
my
argument
and
logic
of
my
argument
is,
the
government
is
not
saying
it
can't
be
done,
period.
that
is,
it
involves
an
activity
which,
because
states
haven't
traditionally
done
it
but
private
parties
have
for
profit,
the
state
has
a
free
and
voluntary
choice,
and
there
is
no
constitutional
principle,
we
submit,
that
entitles
or
ought
to
entitles
a
party
like
florida
prepaid
to
participate
voluntarily
in
a
commercial
market
engaging
in
commercial
advertising
under
the
enjoyment
of
the
lanham
act's
protections,
and
yet
to
spurn
the
reciprocal
obligation
or
condition
clearly
imposed
by
congress
of
amenability
to
the
remedial
provisions
of
the
act
in
order
to
ensure
the
fairness
to
all
who
compete
in
the
market.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
it
does
offer
some
of
the
same
problems,
but
it's
a
distinction
this
court
was
prepared
to
make
and
i
think
is
prepared
to
make
in
the
market
participation,
market
regulation
field
that
i
just
talked
about,
and
even--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--and--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--that's
right,
and
we
also...
the
courts
also
make
it,
mr.
chief
justice,
in
other
contexts.
for
example,
the
legal
status
of
the
united
states
or
states
as
litigants
in,
i
think
it's
united
states
v.
california,
the
question
was,
is
the
united
states
appearing
in
court
in
a
sovereign
function
or
as
a
subrogee
of
a
private
party
or
representing
some
proprietary
interest,
and
i
think
it's--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--i
was
going
to
say,
i
mean,
obviously
the...
i
would
say
the
culmination
of
this
court's
frustration
in
trying
to
distinguish
between
traditional
government
functions
and
nontraditional
government
functions
was
probably
expressed
by
this
court
in
garcia
in
the
context
of
a
substantive
tenth
amendment
regulation
and
i
would
simply
say
in
regard
to
that
that
what
we
have
here
is,
number
1,
this
isn't
the
garcia
test.
this
is
a
test
the
parameters
of
which
have
been
quite
specific
by
missouri
employees.
it's
also
a
test
under
the
eleventh...
may
i
finish
my
sentence?
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
a
test--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--i
won't
put
any
dependent
clauses
in
it...
a
test
under
the
eleventh
amendment
which--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--i
won't
put
two
dependent
clauses
in...
which
presupposes
the
existence
of
a
principal
of
consent
or
waiver.
thank
you
for
your
courtesy.
