mr.
david
c.
todd
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
petitioner
seeks
reversal
of
the
third
circuit's
judgment.
the
1992
trademark
remedy
clarification
act
made
the
states
liable
for
lanham
act
violations.
the
act
was
a
valid
exercise
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
remedial
power
of
congress.
in
the
alternative,
florida
prepaid
should
be
deemed
to
have
waived
its
immunity
under
the
parden
doctrine.
solicitor
general
waxman
will
argue
the
parden
issue.
i
would
like
to
address
abrogation.
the
court
of
appeals
found,
and
florida
prepaid
concedes
that
congress
has
unequivocally
expressed
its
intent
to
abrogate
the
state's
immunity
for
violations
of
section
43(a)
of
the
lanham
act.
the
act
was
a
valid
exercise
of
congress'
power
because
section
43(a)
protects
business
property
rights
from
unfair
competition,
including
false
advertising.
this
court
has
held
that
a
business
is
a
property
right.
that
right
includes
the
right
to
be
free
of
unfair
competition.
mr.
david
c.
todd
the
solicitor
general
does
not,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
david
c.
todd
we
like
to
think
the
solicitor
general
is
half
right.
[laughter]
it...
the...
this
court
has
clearly
found
that
business
is
a
property
right.
the
specific
property
right
which
college
savings
bank
claims
in
this
case
is
the
loss
of
customers
and
earnings
caused
by
florida
prepaid's
false
advertising.
the
court
of
appeals
acknowledged
that
a
business
is
a
property
right,
and
that
fact
has
also
been
conceded
by
florida
prepaid.
mr.
david
c.
todd
in
our
view
the
property
right
was
codified
by
the
congress
in
the
lanham
act.
the
tort
of
unfair
competition
and
trademarks
has
always
been...
have
always
been
wrongs
that
have
been
tied
together.
they
have
long
been
recognized
at
the
common
law,
in
the
common
law.
the
1947
lanham
act
tied
all
these
pieces
together
and
created
a
clear
statement
of
a
federal
remedy
for
unfair
competition.
mr.
david
c.
todd
that
is
our
position,
yes,
mr.
chief
justice,
that
the
fact
is
that
congress
can
step
in,
having
determined
that
the
state
remedies
are
genuinely
inadequate
and
that
there
is
a
need
to
foster
interstate
commerce,
the
commerce
of
this
country,
for
there
to
be
a
federal
standard
governing
these
matters.
mr.
david
c.
todd
yes,
mr.
chief
justice,
i'm
certainly
aware
of
that.
the
passage
of
the
lanham
act
is
clearly
based
upon
the
interstate
commerce
clause.
it
is
a
commerce
clause
exercise
of
congressional
power.
i
think
it's
notable
there's
never
been
any
question
but
that
this
is
a
valid
exercise
of
congress'
power.
however,
the
abrogation
of
the
state's
immunity,
which
did
not
take
place
until
1992,
is
an
exercise
of
congress'
section
5
fourteenth
amendment
power.
florida
prepaid
argues
that
there
is
no
ability
on
the
part
of
congress
to
protect
property
rights
to
the
extent
that
they
have
been
created
or,
i
guess
in
this
case,
even
codified
by
the
congress.
this
is
a
view
of
the
scope
of
section...
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
section
5
powers
which
finds
no
support
in
the
text
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
mr.
david
c.
todd
yes,
mr.
chief
justice,
it
is
our
position.
mr.
david
c.
todd
they
certainly
decided
that
there
was
a
need
for
a
standard
here,
and
that
given
what
they
found
to
be
an
inadequate
protection
of
these
rights
by
the
state,
they
determined
that
in
the
exercise
of
the
section
5
power
there
should
be
an
abrogation.
this
court
has
found
that
it
is
for
congress,
at
least
in
the
first
instance,
to
determine
whether
and
what
legislation
is
needed
in
order
to
secure
the
rights
protected
by
section
1
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
it
is
our
position
that
congress
did
act
pursuant
to
a
valid
grant
of
power
under
section
5.
mr.
david
c.
todd
yes,
justice
o'connor.
mr.
david
c.
todd
no,
but
this
court
has
never
narrowed
a
property
right
in
anything
approaching
a
right
to
alienate
or
sell.
the
fact
of
the
matter
is,
this
court
has
found--
mr.
david
c.
todd
--well,
but--
mr.
david
c.
todd
--justice
o'connor,
i
think
in
the
first
case
i
would
again
like
to
reiterate
that
this
court
has
never
held
a
particular
set
of
attributes
that
must
be
met
in
order
for
a
particular
interest
to
be
called
property.
they
have
held
welfare
benefits
to
be
property,
a
cause
of
action
to
be
property,
a
horse
trainer's
license
to
be
property.
many
of
these
things
are
obviously
not
alienable,
and
you
cannot
use
the
term,
right
to
exclude,
as
a
part
of
any
description
of
those
property
rights
which
have
clearly
been
held
to
be
property
rights
within
the
meaning
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
mr.
david
c.
todd
well,
justice
scalia--
mr.
david
c.
todd
--well,
justice
scalia,
we
have
not
alleged
takings.
we
are
not
contending
that
our
property
as
a
whole
has
been
taken.
we
are
alleging
a
deprivation,
and
we
do
have
possession
of
something.
we
have
possession
of
customers
and
earnings
from
those
customers
which
are
very
much
threatened
by
the
false
advertising,
and
it
makes
no
difference
whether
the
false--
mr.
david
c.
todd
--if
it
is
proscribed
by
law,
yes,
i
would
say
so,
mr....
justice
scalia.
mr.
david
c.
todd
justice
stevens,
in
the
context
of
this
case,
no.
i
think
customer
lists
are
really
not
an
issue.
it
is
perfectly
clear,
however,
that--
mr.
david
c.
todd
--we
are
not.
mr.
david
c.
todd
justice
kennedy,
i
think
the
cases
are
not
at
all
closely
related.
in
daniels,
you
had
a
state
employee
leaving
a
pillow
on
the
stairs.
it
was
a
random
act
of
a
given
employee.
here,
we
have
a
deliberate
action
by
an
agency
created
by
the
state
of
florida.
there's
nothing
random
about
this.
this
is
not
a
tort
of
negligence.
the
state
of
florida--
mr.
david
c.
todd
--i
would
suggest
two
things,
that
i
think
that
this
court
clearly
has
found...
they
have
never
found
a
case...
i
have
no
case
specifically
on
point.
however,
this
court
has
found
that
this
kind
of
a
right
represents
a
property
right,
the
international
news
service.
the
position
of
petitioner
is
that
a
property
right
is
a
property
right,
and
it
is
not
constitutionally
permissible
to
begin
parsing
property
rights
which
are
protectable
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
property
rights
which
are
not
protectable,
and
to
say
that
a
business
is
property
standing
alone
really
doesn't
mean
anything
unless
you
can
give
some
enforcement
power
to
that
concept.
a
business
is
obviously
more
than
a
building
and
desks
and
chairs.
a
business
consists
of
goodwill,
a
going
concern
value,
and
a
business
as
a
property
right
is
meaningless
unless
there
is
the
ability
to
protect
that
business
from
this
kind
of
injury.
mr.
david
c.
todd
well,
justice
scalia,
the
harm
to
the
business
from
a
competitor
misrepresenting
his
own
goods
and
services
is
identical
to
the
harm
caused
by
a
misrepresentation
of
the
competitor's--
mr.
david
c.
todd
--well,
justice
scalia,
with
respect,
there
is
nothing
in
the
jurisprudence
in
this
court
which
suggests
that
property
interests
are
limited
to
those
things
which
would
be
deemed
to
be
larceny
if
stolen.
welfare
benefits,
a
horse
trainer's
license,
and
a
driver's
license
aren't
property
interests...
are
property
interests,
but
they're
not
susceptible
to
that
kind
of
a
test.
mr.
david
c.
todd
well--
mr.
david
c.
todd
--justice
scalia,
the
entire
business
of
college
savings
bank
is
threatened
by
this
kind
of
false
advertising,
and
i
would
like
to
close
and
save
some
time
for
rebuttal
just
by
stating
that
neither
the
court
of
appeals
nor
florida
prepaid
has
cited
a
single
decision
by
this
court
in
which
an
economic
interest
has
not
been
found
to
be
property.
mr.
chief
justice--
mr.
david
c.
todd
--justice
o'connor,
we
believe
that
an
ex
parte
young
action
would
lie.
it
would
not
make
us
whole.
mr.
david
c.
todd
there
are
not
adequate
state
remedies
across
the
board.
even
in
florida
the
adequacy
of
the
state
remedy
is
dubious,
at
best.
