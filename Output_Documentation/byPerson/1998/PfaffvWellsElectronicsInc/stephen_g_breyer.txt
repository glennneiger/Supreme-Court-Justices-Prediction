the
invention
must
be
there.
now,
the
invention
is
there
if
the
three
basic
nonobviousnesses
are
satisfied,
and
if
it's
reduced
to
practice,
but
if
it's
not
reduced
to
practice,
it's
still
there
if
there
is
a
very
written
description
in
detail
such
that
you
could
go
and
get
it
patented
right
then
at
the
patent
office,
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
if
that's
the
test,
and
you
include
the
last
one,
his
complaint
is
that
reintroduces
all
the
uncertainty
that's
driving
everyone
in
this
field
mad,
because
what
you
will
discover
is,
in
fact,
after
the
event,
sure
it
was
in
the
inventor's
head.
that's
right.
now
we
know
that,
but
he
never
wrote
it
down
anywhere
and,
moreover,
it
was
never
reduced
to
practice,
and
there
are
all
kinds
of
things
floating
around
in
inventors'
heads,
and
boy,
this
is
uncertain.
that's
what
their
complaint
is,
so
i'd
like
your
response
to
that
third
part
of
your
alternative
test
there
as
to
why
it
isn't
uncertain.
