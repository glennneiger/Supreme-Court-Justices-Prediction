the
section
102(b)
of
the
patent
act
provides
that
no
person
is
entitled
to
patent
an
invention
that
has
been
on-sale
more
than
one
year
before
filing
a
patent
application.
we
granted
certiorari
in
this
case
to
determine
whether
the
commercial
marketing
of
a
newly
invented
product
may
signal
the
beginning
of
the
1-year
period
even
though
the
invention
has
not
yet
been
reduced
to
practice.
the
petitioner
in
this
case
is
the
inventor
of
a
computer
chip
socket.
more
than
a
year
before
he
applied
for
his
patent
he
accepted
an
order
for
over
30000
of
his
new
sockets
and
deliver
specification
for
the
production
of
the
device
to
a
manufacturer.
he
had
not
however
prepared
an
actual
working
model
of
the
device
and
because
of
the
time
that
the
manufacturer
needed
to
develop
the
necessary
customized
tooling
the
order
was
not
filled
until
several
months
later.
insure
that
the
invention
was
conceived
and
the
device
was
offered
for
sale
more
than
a
year
before
the
application
was
filed,
but
it
was
first
reduced
to
practice
less
than
a
year
before
the
filing
date.
the
district
court
for
the
northern
district
of
texas,
found
that
the
patent
application
was
timely
because
it
was
filed
less
than
a
year
after
the
first
socket
was
produced,
but
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
federal
circuit
reversed.
that
court
concluded
that
the
invention
was
"substantially
complete"
when
petitioner
put
it
on
a
sale
more
than
a
year
before
filing
the
patent
application
and
therefore
his
patent
was
invalid
under
section
102(b).
we
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
but
we
disagree
with
its
conclusion
that
section
102(b)'s
1-year
period
begins
when
an
invention
that
is
substantially
complete
is
put
on
sale.
we
hold
that
the
on-sale
bar
applies
when
two
conditions
are
satisfied
before
the
critical
date.
first,
the
product
must
be
the
subject
of
a
commercial
author
for
sale
as
opposed
to
an
experimental
sale.
second,
the
invention
must
be
ready
for
patenting.
the
ready
for
patenting
test
would
usually
be
met
by
proof
that
before
the
critical
date
the
invention
was
reduced
to
practice.
but,
it
may
also
be
met
by
proof
that
the
inventor
had
prepared
drawings
or
other
descriptions
of
the
invention
that
were
sufficiently
specific
to
enable
a
person
skilled
in
the
art
to
construct
the
invention.
petitioner's
patent
is
therefore
invalid
under
102(b).
our
opinion,
holding
the
patent
invalid,
is
unanimous.
