mr.
selinger--
unknown
speaker
--do
you
think
that
an
invention
has
to
be
reduced
to
practice
in
order
to
get
a
patent?
unknown
speaker
yes?
you
know,
this
may
reflect
a
fundamental
misunderstanding
on
my
part,
which
could
be
the
case.
i'm
not
an
expert
on
patent
law.
i
had
thought
one
could
patent
an
invention
based
on
drawings
and
plans
and
descriptions
sufficiently
clear
to
enable
one
to
make
it,
and
i
had
thought,
without
ever
producing
the
item,
one
could
take
those
things
to
the
patent
office
and
secure
a
patent.
is
that
wrong?
unknown
speaker
well,
don't
complicate
it.
it
is
possible
that
somebody
can
get
a
patent
without
having
physically
produced
the
article--
unknown
speaker
--in
the
patent?
unknown
speaker
now,
was
the
socket
here
sufficiently
described
that
a
patent
could
have
been
obtained
before
it
was
physically
produced?
unknown
speaker
why
shouldn't
it
turn
on
patentability
rather
than
reduction
to
practice?
unknown
speaker
well,
but
i
agree
with
the
inference
at
least
i
draw
from
justice
o'connor's
question,
if
there
is
enough
information
to
secure
a
patent,
and
if
he
finds
a
willing
buyer
for
30,000
units,
what
purpose
is
served
by
adding
the
arbitrary
requirement
that
it
be
reduced
to
practice,
other
than
to
extend
the
17
year
period
plus
1?
i
just
don't
see
the
purpose
of
that.
unknown
speaker
other
than
to
extend
the
life
of
the
patent.
unknown
speaker
well,
why
isn't
it
clear?
if
it's
patentable,
and
you
sell
it,
that
invokes
the
bar.
there's
no
further
requirement.
why
isn't
that
a
clear
line?
unknown
speaker
i
have
the
written
description
that
i
can
walk
right
down
to
the
patent
office
and
get
my
patent
on
it.
anybody
can
make
it
based
on
that
description,
and
i
enter
into
an
agreement
that,
based
on
that
plan,
on
date
x
i'm
going
to
deliver
these
items
to
you.
i
haven't
made
them
yet,
but
i'm
going
to
do
it
on
date
x.
is
that
a
sale?
unknown
speaker
no?
unknown
speaker
it's
a
contract
for
sale.
unknown
speaker
but
you've
left
out
something
in
between,
and
that's
invention.
justice
o'connor
was
putting
to
you,
the
case
is,
you
have
the
invention.
the
invention
is
what
can
be
patented.
you
can't
get
a
patent
on
a
mere
conception,
can
you?
unknown
speaker
but
when
you
have
something
that
you
can
bring
down
to
the
patent
office
and
get
it
registered,
then
you
have
an
invention,
don't
you?
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
isn't...
the
word
constructive
is
really
not
helpful
at
all,
because
it
says
you
haven't
reduced
it
to
practice.
you
have
the
drawings,
as
justice
o'connor
described.
it's
precise
enough
that
somebody
could
copy
it,
somebody
knowledgeable
in
the
art,
but
constructive
really
doesn't
help.
i
mean,
constructive
means
you
didn't
construct
it.
constructive
means
that
you
have
no
reduction
to
practice,
so
let's
just
deal
with
that.
you
keep
talking
about
conception
and
reduction
to
practice.
why
shouldn't
we
concentrate
on
invention,
and
in
that
light,
how
frequent
is
it
that
someone
gets
a
patent
on
an
invention
that
hasn't
been
reduced
to
practice?
is
that
a
rare
thing?
unknown
speaker
if
you
have--
--suppose
we
pick
that
up.
suppose
we...
do
you--
--no,
no.
--suppose
we
just
pick
that
up.
is
there
anything
wrong
with
the
following
rule?
i
take
it
there
might
be
some
confusion
because
to
get
a
patent
you
have
to
show
that
the
thing
is
useful,
novel,
and
nonobvious.
then
it's
patentable.
unknown
speaker
all
right.
but
then
there's
an
additional
requirement
that
the
patent
office
has
put
in.
the
additional
requirement
is,
a)
you've
reduced
it
to
practice,
or
b)
you
haven't
reduced
it
to
practice
but
you've
written
it
down
in
such
detail
that
a
knowledgeable
person
could
reduce
it
to
practice,
so
we
either
have
the
thing
itself,
the
toy
here,
or
we
have
a
piece
of
paper
that
describes
the
toy
in
great
detail
so
that
a
toy
maker
could
do
it.
isn't
that
right?
am
i
right?
i'm
just
reading
the
sg's
brief.
that's
where
i
got
it
from.
unknown
speaker
wait
i'll
get
his
exact
words.
it
says,
the
invention
has
been
reduced
to
practice,
or
the
invention
is
described
sufficiently
in
the
application
to
satisfy
the
written
description
requirement
and
to
enable
a
skilled
artisan
to
practice
the
invention.
now,
i
must
have...
i've
read
correctly,
i
think,
what
he
said,
and
so
you
have
to
have
a
rather
detailed
written
description,
is
that
right?
unknown
speaker
in
order
to
get
the
patent.
unknown
speaker
well,
subsection
(b)
requires
public
use
for
on
sale.
unknown
speaker
i
mean,
in
addition
to
the
patentability,
public
use
or
on
sale.
unknown
speaker
that's
why
i
asked
you
about
the
contract
for
sale,
but
you
say
a
contract
for
sale
isn't
a
sale.
unknown
speaker
i
think
that
is
a
problem
with
the
test,
but
could
it...
could
we
say
that
you
can
protect
yourself
by
contract?
you
can
say
that
you
need
this
period
in
order
to
have
in
effect
r&d,
and
have
something
that's
short
of
a
sale,
an
option,
or
something
like
that.
unknown
speaker
i
guess
what
i'm
asking
is,
could
we
avoid
the
difficulties
you
mention
by
just
putting
the
burden
on
the
would
be
patent
holder
to
draw
the
contract
documents
correctly?
unknown
speaker
but
that's
missing...
judge
bryson's
formulation
addresses
that,
doesn't
it?
unknown
speaker
why
isn't
his
formulation
then
sort
of
a
good
answer
to
your
answer
to
justice
breyer's
suggestion?
if
what
he
wrote
is
sufficient
to
anticipate,
or
make
obvious
what
later
eventuates
is
the
invention,
that
would
suffice,
what's
wrong
with
that?
unknown
speaker
well,
it
may
be
as
close
as
we
can
get
to
one,
but
i...
you
were
specifically
saying...
in
response
to
justice
breyer
you're
saying,
well,
the
problem
with
the
solicitor
general's
test
is
that
what
i
agree
to
sell
when
i'm
still
in
perhaps
in
a
stage
of
development,
whether
i
think
so
or
not,
may
turn
out
to
be
something
different
from
what
i
actually
sell
after
i've
tested
my
product
6
months
later,
and
the
bryson
formulation
does
address
that
problem.
unknown
speaker
well--
--your
point
is
that
the
inventor
has
to
know
right
away
whether
he
has
a
year
left
or
not.
unknown
speaker
it's
not
good
enough
that
you
can
tell
clearly
3
years
later
that
he
then
had
a
year
left.
he
has
to
know
it
now.
unknown
speaker
why
aren't
we
focusing
on...
i
mean,
we're
focusing
on
the
word
invention.
why
not
focus
on
the
word
sale?
wouldn't
the
problem
be
solved
if
a
sale
does
not
include
a
contract
to
sell,
and
if
it
includes
only
the
delivery
of
the
actual
working
product?
unknown
speaker
why
can't
we
go
down
that
road?
i
mean,
i
think
it's
a
reasonable
use
of
the
word...
i
mean,
the
law
in
some
situations
draws
a
distinction
between
a
sale
and
a
contract
to
sell.
but
the
question
is,
what
do
the
words
on
sale
mean?
can
a
product
be
on
sale
before
the
sale
is
actually
consummated?
unknown
speaker
okay.
so
you
really
do
not
argue
for
the
position
that
there's
got
to
be
a
consummated
sale
as
opposed
to
a
contract
for
sale
to
trigger
the
application.
unknown
speaker
before
you
do,
is
it
your
position
that
there
cannot
be
a
patentable
invention
until
it's
reduced
to
practice?
unknown
speaker
and
then
will
you
sometime
in
your
argument
explain
to
me
how
subsection
(g)
can
be
squared
with
that?
unknown
speaker
i
thought
your
position
was
either
reduced
to
practice
or
a
patent
application
filed?
unknown
speaker
i
mean,
let's...
what
you
call
constructively
reduced
to
practice.
unknown
speaker
and
you
have
conceded
that
many
patent
applications
are
filed
when
the
invention
hasn't
been
reduced
to
practice,
so
we've
already
gotten
clear
on,
you
don't
need
to
reduce
it
to
practice
to
have
an
invention.
unknown
speaker
what
you're
talking
about
in
this
case
is
an
actual
reduction
to
practice.
unknown
speaker
and
i
have
already
expressed
my
view
when
you
say
constructive
you're
saying
we
haven't
reduced
it
to
practice.
you
have
agreed
that
you
can
get...
you
can
file
a
patent
although
you
have
not
made...
it
has
not
been
physically
embodied
in
the
product.
unknown
speaker
so
you
don't
equate
invention
with
reduction,
actual
reduction
to
practice.
unknown
speaker
but
if
that
is
so,
it's
odd
that
congress
would
use
reduction
to
practice
only
in
subsection
(g).
unknown
speaker
but
i
thought
we
at
the
very
beginning
established
that
you
can
have
an
invention
before
it's
reduced
to
practice.
justice
o'connor's
first
question,
i
thought
that
was
the
beginning
point
of
our
discussion.
unknown
speaker
but
subsection
(g)
makes
it
perfectly
clear,
it
seems
to
me,
that
the
person
who
first
conceives
the
invention
may
acquire
the...
a
patent
even
though
that
person
was
the
last
to
reduce
it
to
practice.
that's
what
the
last
clause
says.
unknown
speaker
and
if
that's
true
it
follows
as
night
follows
the
day
that
the
reduction
of
practice
was
not
an
essential
element
of
having
a
patentable
invention.
unknown
speaker
no,
but
the
person
who
was
last
to
reduce
to
practice
may
nevertheless
get
the
patent
if
that
person
exercised
reasonable
diligence,
which
makes
it
clear
that
there
can
be
a
patentable
invention
before
the
reduction
to
practice
occurs.
that
language
doesn't
make
sense
if
you
don't
read
it
that
way.
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
now,
where...
are
you
reading
from
102(g)
or
just
paraphrasing?
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
well,
but
you're
the
first
inventor
if
you're
the
second
to
reduce
to
practice,
which
means
you
must
have
had
an
invention
before
the
reduction
to
practice
occurred,
otherwise
you
wouldn't
be
the
first
inventor.
unknown
speaker
but
you're
the
first
inventor
even
though
you're
the
second
to
reduce
to
practice.
you
do
agree
with
that.
unknown
speaker
well
now,
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
federal
circuit
treated
as
a
sale
the
purchase
order
before
the
delivery
of
the
items,
did
it
not?
unknown
speaker
as
a
sale,
that
it
was
on
sale
as
of
the
date
the
purchase
order
was
awarded.
unknown
speaker
and
the
delivery,
the
first
delivery
occurred
in
july
although
the
purchase
order
was
given
in...
april
8th?
unknown
speaker
and
you
say
now
that
we
have
to
date
it
from
the
delivery,
the
1
year.
unknown
speaker
well,
the
items
were
delivered
in
july.
unknown
speaker
that's
the
date
you
argue
for?
unknown
speaker
but
i
thought
you
had
told
me
earlier
that
the
on
sale
provision
required
a
delivery.
now
you're
telling
me
it
require...
it
can
be
something
else.
you
need
to
settle
on
something,
probably.
unknown
speaker
consistently.
unknown
speaker
i
thought
that's
what
you
did
tell
me.
unknown
speaker
we
talked
about
that.
i
said,
is
the
contract
of
sale
a
sale.
no.
there
has
to
be
a
delivery,
i
thought
you
told
me.
unknown
speaker
but
we've
already
established
though
that
you
can
have
an
invention
patented
on
the
basis
of
written
descriptions
and
plans.
unknown
speaker
and
it
is
an
invention
then.
you
have
the
patent,
and
it
is
what
you
have
patented
is
an
invention,
so
we
have
an
invention
before
it
is
reduced
to
practice.
we've
established
that.
unknown
speaker
i
think
we
can
forget
that
terminology.
in
plain
fact,
you
have
an
invention
when
you
have
filed
with
the
patent
office
the
sufficient
written
description.
unknown
speaker
well,
it
doesn't
hurt
your
case.
i
mean,
you're...
you
can
put
it
that
way.
you
say
that
there
is
no
invention
unless
you
have
either
reduced
it
to
practice
or
filed
a
patent
application.
it
makes
sense
to
me.
unknown
speaker
why
can't
they
do
that
by
contract
documents
that
are
short
of
sale?
they
say
it's
a
put
contract.
the
requirement
on
the
would
be
buyer
would
be
that
he
can't
disclose
the
secrets,
et
cetera.
in
other
words,
we
announce
this
rule,
and
then
the
patent
world
just
adjusts
by
drawing
the
contract
documents
to
protect
themselves.
unknown
speaker
counsel,
i...
in
bonito
boats
this
court
quoted
with
favor,
i
thought,
the
observation
of
judge
learned
hand
about
section
102(b),
which
is
the
statute
we're
dealing
with,
when
he
said
it
is
a
condition
upon
the
inventor's
right
to
a
patent
that
he
shall
not
exploit
his
discovery
competitively
after
it
is
ready
for
patenting.
he
must
content
himself
with
either
secrecy
or
legal
monopoly.
unknown
speaker
thank
you,
mr.
selinger.
mr.
bain,
we'll
hear
from
you.
unknown
speaker
well,
a
contract
for
sale,
not
a
delivery
of
the
items.
unknown
speaker
a
purchase
order.
unknown
speaker
right,
but
how
do
you
know...
i
mean,
it's
very
easy
to
say
there
was
nothing
more
to
be
done
in
the
inventive
process,
but
how
does
the
prospective
patentor,
or
patentee,
know
at
the
time
he's
making
this
contract
that
there
is
nothing
more
to
be
done
in
the
inventive
process,
because
in
the
course
of
trying
to
reduce
it
to...
to
an
actual
working
instrument,
he
may
make
changes.
unknown
speaker
he
thinks
he
has
it
but
he's
wrong
about
one
of
the
details
of
it,
and
that
error
comes
out
in
the
course
of
trying
to
produce
what
he
has
to
deliver
under
the
contract.
now...
but
you
know,
at
the
time,
whether
that
will
happen
or
not,
he
doesn't
know
at
the
time
that
he
enters
into
the
contract.
unknown
speaker
and
therefore
if
delivery
is
2
years
from
now
he
doesn't
know
whether
he...
you
know,
whether...
before
the
actual
delivery
he's
lost
his
patent
rights
or
not.
it
seems
to
me
you
need
a
rule
that
the
inventor
can
know
as
soon
as
possible.
unknown
speaker
the
reduction
to
practice--
unknown
speaker
--exactly.
that's
why
i
find
the
line
suggested
either
an
actual
reduction
to
practice
or
the
filing
of
a
patent
application.
you
know...
you
know
the
gun
has
gone
off
then,
and
you
have
a
year.
you
built
the
thing
and
it
works
where
you
file
a
patent
application.
i...
there's
a
great
virtue
to
that
clear
line,
and
i
find
it
very
fuzzy
what
point
of
time
you
want
us
to
look...
i
mean,
you
can't--
--but
in
this
case
was
there
any
conditions
on
the
sale?
was
it
a
sale,
if
it
works
you
have
to
buy
it,
or
was
there
an
unconditional
agreement
to
sell
the
item?
unknown
speaker
but
would
there
have
been...
would
the
seller
have
defaulted
on
the
contract
if
he
shipped
goods
that
didn't
work?
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
another
question
about
the
on
sale
portion
of
it?
leave
aside
the
question
of
when
the
trigger
goes
off.
on
sale,
we've
established,
can
mean
a
contract.
suppose
its
just
that
the
inventor
says
to
the
world,
i've
got
this
thing,
commercially
advertises
it
for
sale,
would
that
satisfy
the
on
sale
requirement?
unknown
speaker
you
don't
even
need
a
contract.
you
don't
even
need
a
purchaser.
as
long
as
you
have
put
yourself
forward
as
offering
the
thing
for
sale--
unknown
speaker
--it's
on
sale.
unknown
speaker
what
happens
if--
unknown
speaker
--what
happens
if
the
inventor
wants
to
make
a
contract
to
deliver
the
goods
and
he
knows
that
he's
going
to
need
more
than
2
years...
more
than
1
year,
let's
say
3
years
to
reduce
it
to
practice,
and
he's
fairly
certain
that
in
the
process
of
reducing
to
practice
he's
going
to
have
to
make
some
changes
in
the
basic
design.
is
he
just
out
of
luck,
under
your
view?
unknown
speaker
or
does
he
make
an
r&d
contract
or
what?
unknown
speaker
i
agree.
that's
the
very
problem
i
have.
unknown
speaker
so
long
as
you
don't
describe
the
invention
in
the
sales
contract
it
is
not
on
sale?
unknown
speaker
well,
suppose--
unknown
speaker
--even
though
both
of
you
know
that
this
widget
is
going
to
be
produced
by
doing
a,
b,
c,
and
d?
unknown
speaker
well,
you
both
know
that,
but
you
don't
say
it
in
the
contract.
unknown
speaker
oh,
but
i
think
that
is
normally
the
case,
because
i
don't
think
that
a
big
operator
is
going
to
believe
that
you
can
produce
a
widget
which
nobody
else
has
ever
produced.
you
have
to
go
to
them
and
say,
look
it,
i
have,
you
know,
i've
invented
the
mouse
trap.
i
am
going
to
put
together
a,
b,
c,
and
d,
and
he
says,
brilliant,
i'll
buy
that
if
you
can
do
it.
he's
not
going
to
buy
a
pig
in
a
poke
when
nobody
else
has
ever
invented
a
widget
before.
unknown
speaker
so
is
that
the
answer
to
what...
to
what
i
thought
the
colleague
petitioner
i
think
responded
to
my
question.
you
put
this...
exactly
this
subject
in
my
mind,
that
a
company
goes
and
shows
a
business...
an
inventor
a
very,
very
complicated
computer
and
says,
we
need
some
little
part
in
here,
and
although
that
sounds
easy,
it's
very
difficult,
and
the
inventor
says,
i
know
i
can
invent
it.
that's
not
a
problem.
i
mean,
it
will
be
this
way
roughly,
and
they
describe
it
in
fairly
good
detail
but
not
in
such
detail
that
you
could
go
make
it
right
then
and
there,
and
so
they
sign
a
contract
for
it
expecting
it
will
take
2
or
3
years.
now
the
time
begins
to
pass,
and
the
inventor
tries
50
different
things.
you
know,
first
this,
first
that,
and
he
isn't
quite
certain
which
is
the
best.
now,
may
40
of
those
50
would
qualify
as
inventions
once
he's
written
them
down,
but
he
isn't
going
to
go
actually
make
it
until
he's
sure
he's
got
the
best
one.
now,
what's
he
supposed
to
do?
is
he
supposed
to,
under
your
rule...
and
this
may
be
fairly
common.
is
he,
every
time
he's
written
out
a
description
of
something
in
detail
that
would
count
as
the
invention,
which,
by
the
way,
he'll
get
something
better
3
days
later,
it's
never
going
to
be
reduced
to
practice.
does
he
then
have
to
go
and
file
a
patent
application
immediately,
possibly
having
hundreds
of
patent
applications,
just
because
it
may
turn
out
he's
got
the
best
one
and
he
doesn't
really
know
for
3
or
4
years,
and
that's
why
he
hasn't
reduced
it
to
practice.
he's
still
working
on
this.
now,
your
rule,
he'd
have
to
file,
wouldn't
he?
unknown
speaker
the
sg's
rule
he'd
have
to
file,
i
guess.
why
wouldn't
he?
unknown
speaker
i
mean,
obviously
i'm
trying
to...
maybe
you
can
tell
me
my
case
is
just
unlikely
to
occur
very
often.
unknown
speaker
but
what
we
seem
to
be
trying
to
do
here,
all
the
different
bars
are
trying
to
tell
us,
be
more
specific.
don't
just
use
some
vague
conception
in
his
head.
do
try,
and
the
candidates
seem
to
be,
a
reduce
to
practice,
or
b
reduce
to
practice
or,
if
not,
have
it
written
down,
or
if
not
2),
then
do
2),
but
there's
another
alternative.
you
could
have
thought
of
it
to
the
point
where
somebody
would
have
been
able
to
write
it
down
if
they'd
been
able
to
cross
examine
you.
that
sounds
like
a
very
dangerous
one,
but
that
seems
to
be
the
one
the
sg
is
pushing,
and
maybe
you're
pushing,
and
so
that's
where
i
am.
unknown
speaker
i'm
really
confused,
because
as
i
understood
justice
breyer's
hypothetical
there
had
to
have
been
a
sale
anyway,
according
to
you.
unknown
speaker
well--
unknown
speaker
--all
he
agreed
to
do
was
to
devise
this
little
gimmick
for
the
computer.
unknown
speaker
you
know,
i
want...
he
didn't
say
how
he
was
going
to
devise...
i
think
he
would
have
said
there
was
no
sale.
unknown
speaker
excuse
me.
going
back
to
justice
scalia's
question,
isn't
it
still
the
case
in
justice
breyer's
hypothetical
there
has
been
no
contract
for
sale
and
no
on
sale
within
the
meaning
of
the
definition
that
you
gave
earlier?
unknown
speaker
but
i
mean,
it
seems
to
me
that
if
we
accept
your
definition
there
aren't
going
to
be
many
sales,
because
many...
i
assume
there
are
not
going
to
be
very
many
sales
contracts
that
in
fact
are
going
to
go
into
detail
in
specifying
elements
a,
b,
and
c,
or
whatever
they
are,
so
that
would
seem
to
me
to
reduce
the
bar
to
such
a
narrow
limit
in
its
application
that
it's
unlikely
that
congress
would
have
assumed
such
a
narrow
definition.
unknown
speaker
even
if
the
seller
knows
he's
selling
his
invention,
you
say
both
of
them
have
to
know
that
he's
selling
his
invention.
unknown
speaker
well,
under
those
circumstances
i
could
never
buy
a
computer
on
sale.
i'll
never
understand
what's
going
on
there.
they
could
sell
me
anything
and
it
would--
[laughter]
i'd
never
know.
so
on
that
definition,
there
will
never
be
a
sale,
a
computer
on
sale
to
me
within
the
meaning
of
(b).
unknown
speaker
so
it
doesn't
have
to
say--
unknown
speaker
--it
doesn't
have
to
say
a,
b,
c,
and
d.
it
has
to
say,
this...
this--
--yes,
but
if
you've
got
a
sample,
you've
got
it
reduced
to
practice.
unknown
speaker
thank
you,
mr.
bain.
unknown
speaker
mr.
bain,
your
time
has
expired.
unknown
speaker
mr.
minear,
we'll
hear
from
you.
unknown
speaker
before
you
get
to
invention,
what
do
you
mean
by
on
sale?
do
you
mean
the
same
thing--
unknown
speaker
--as
mr.
bain
means?
unknown
speaker
but
the
buyer
has
to
know
that
he's
buying
a,
b,
c,
d?
it's
not
enough
to
know
that
he
is
buying
a
device
which
will
do
x--
unknown
speaker
--and
the
inventor
knows
that
he's
going
to
get
it
to
do
x
by
combining
a,
b,
c,
d.--
unknown
speaker
--that's
important,
because--
unknown
speaker
--because
the
response,
i
think,
of
mr.
bain
to
mr.
selinger,
as
i
understood
it
and
tried
to
encapsulate
it
in
this
hypothetical,
i'm
worried
about
the
person,
the
inventor
who
keeps
having
50
different
things
over
the
period
of
2
or
3
years
to
see
which
is
the
best.
and
i
think
what
justice
scalia
was
saying,
if
the
sale
contract
which
took
place
before
this
process
began
described
in
very
great
detail
exactly
what
this
particular
thing
that
was
to
be
invented
would
do,
but
still
left
it
open
as
to
which
of
50
different
possible
inventions
would
satisfy
that,
there
wouldn't
be
a
sale.
rather,
for
there
to
be
a
sale
you'd
have
to
refer
absolutely
explicitly
to
the
particular
invention
that
we're
talking
about,
which
means
to
say
you
can't
get
into
the
position
of
selling
the
thing
in
advance
before
it's
invented.
unknown
speaker
if
that's
right.
i
mean,
i
may
not
have
understood
it,
but
that
was
your
understanding,
too.
unknown
speaker
well,
is
this
a
prospective
test,
or
a
retrospective
test,
because
i
still
am
not
sure
of
the
answer
to
the
question.
unknown
speaker
if
we
don't
know
quite
what
it's
going
to
look
like,
we
later
know
retrospectively
that
you
did
sell
the
invention,
but
we
don't
know
prospectively
that
you
did.
unknown
speaker
i'm
not
concerned
with
the
question
of,
if
there's
a
change
along
the
way.
you're
looking
at
it
retrospectively.
i'm
concerned
from
the
standpoint
of
the
prospective
patentee.
how
does
he
know
whether
there's
going
to
be
a
change
along
the
way?
how
does
he
know
whether
his
year
clock
is
ticking
or
not?
he
can't
know
until
he
sees
whether
there's
been
a
change
along
the
way
or
not.
unknown
speaker
in
other
words,
on
your
rule
he
can't
get
in
trouble,
because
if,
in
fact,
what
the
change
would
be,
subject
to
anticipation
in
light
of
his
original
application,
he's
filed
an
original
application,
so
he's
covered
there.
if
the
change
is
radical,
then
he
knows
that,
in
fact,
a
new
1
year
period
will
start
to
run
and,
following
your
rule,
he
will
file
a
new
application.
unknown
speaker
of
course,
every
inventor
will
say
that
in
order
to
extend
his
year.
i
mean,
you're
creating
an
opportunity
for
production
of
uncertainty.
unknown
speaker
i
mean,
why
would
only
the
inventor
who
has
a
half
baked
idea
say
that?
why
wouldn't
every
inventor
say
it
in
order
to
make
it
difficult
to
prove
the
1
year
bar?
unknown
speaker
wait,
you're
not
talking...
forget
this
case
for
a
moment,
because
we're
trying
to
get
a
rule.
unknown
speaker
and
your
rules
say,
embodies
the
invention,
does
the
sale
embody
the
invention,
right?
unknown
speaker
okay.
now,
i
take
it
that
rules
out
the
possibility
where
the
invention
isn't
yet
invented,
so
it
doesn't
include
contracts
to
develop
anything.
unknown
speaker
and
if
neither
are
those
two
things
are
true,
it's
also
there
if
you
could
do
any
of
the
latter
two
things
but
you
haven't
done
them
yet.
unknown
speaker
is
that
the
test?
unknown
speaker
how
is
that
an
improvement
over
what
the
federal
circuit's
doing
that
every
part
of
the
bar
is
upset
about?
unknown
speaker
the
honorable
court
is
now
adjourned
until
tomorrow
at
ten
o'clock.
