mr.
c.
randall
bain
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court--
i
would
first
like
to
point
out
with
particularly
the
facts
of
this
case
that
the
inventive
process
had
been
entirely
completed
and
that
a
sale
of
the
product
had
been
made
more
than
1
year
before
the
patent
application
was
filed.
mr.
c.
randall
bain
yes.
i'm
using--
mr.
c.
randall
bain
--that
is
correct,
your
honor,
purchase
order,
but
there
had
been
an
offer
and
acceptance.
it
was
a
contract.
it
was
a
sale
in
that
sense.
i
think
we
normally
do
refer
to
a
sale
as
something
that
is
made
by
the
contract,
not
by
the
delivery,
and
i'm
using
it
in
that
sense,
but
more
than
1
year
before
the
patent
application
was
filed
we
had
that
commercialization
completed
and
we
had
beyond
any
doubt
a
completed
invention,
nothing
more
to
be
done
in
the
inventive
process.
that
should
invoke
the
on
sale
bar
of
section
102(b),
and
it
is
only
by
reading
into
the
definition
of
invention
in
102(b),
this
notion
of
reduction
to
practice,
that
the
petitioner
is
able
to
contend
that
the
on
sale
bar
does
not
apply,
and
that
is
fundamentally--
mr.
c.
randall
bain
--in
some
cases
he
will,
beyond
any
doubt,
your
honor,
and
in
those
cases...
and
i
think
this
is
an
important
point
for
a
number
of
the
questions
that
have
been
asked
already.
you
may
not
yet
have
an
invention
if
that's
the
fact.
that
is
not
the
fact
in
this
case,
but
if
it
is
the
fact
that
the
inventor
does
not
know,
and
a
reasonable
person,
a
reasonable
person
of
ordinary
skill
looking
at
this
would
not
know
at
that
point
in
time
whether
or
not
they
have
a
working
invention,
then
they
do
not
have
a
utilit...
they
don't
have
the
utilitarian
aspect
of
an
invention,
and
so
they
don't
have
an
invention
yet.
mr.
c.
randall
bain
i
would
submit--
mr.
c.
randall
bain
--the...
in
point
of
fact,
as
a
fact
issue,
of
course,
we
have
that
possibility
always,
that
the
inventor
subjectively
is
wrong.
i
submit
that
the
test
is
whether,
if
you
want
to
test
whether
or
not
the
invention
is
complete,
it
ought
to
be
an
objective
test
as
to
whether
at
that
point
a
reasonable
person
would
believe
that
the
invention
would
function
for
its
intended
purpose.
mr.
c.
randall
bain
and
that
is
exactly,
may
i
add,
what
happens
when
you
go
to
the
patent
office.
mr.
c.
randall
bain
i
believe
that
the
buyer
had
the
right
to
reject
the
goods
if
they
didn't
work,
but
of
course
that's
true
in
virtually
any
sale
under
the
uniform
commercial
code.
mr.
c.
randall
bain
yes.
i
think
that
would
be
a
breach
of
warranty.
the--
mr.
c.
randall
bain
--the
current
jurisprudence
certainly
says
yes.
if
you're
offering
for
sale,
then
it
is
on
sale.
mr.
c.
randall
bain
that
correct--
mr.
c.
randall
bain
--yes.
that
correctly
states
the
current
state
of
the
law,
as
i
understand
it.
the...
the
difficulty
with
attempting
to
focus
on
the
on
sale
language
as
opposed
to
the
invention
language
of
102(b),
and
then
say
until
the
physical
embodiment
is
sold,
is
that
it
does
not
comport
with
what
102(b)
says.
what
102(b)
says
to
us
is
that
when
the
invention
exists,
and
when
it
is
on
sale
1
year
prior
to
the
date
of
filing,
then
it
is
invalid,
and
so
we
must
fundamentally
go
back
to
102(b)
and,
unless
we
are
to
say
that
the
fundamental
principle,
i
think,
that
has
been
with
us
for
a
very
long
time
in
patent
law
that
was
noted
in
bonito
boats
and
was
well
stated
by
judge
learned
hand,
is
that
we
have
an
important
policy
in
encouraging
inventors.
once
the
invention
is
in
place,
we
encourage
the
inventors
to
file
their
patent
application,
and
that
fundamental
policy
was
noted
in
bonito
boats,
and
it
is
exactly
why
the
on
sale
bar,
the
on
sale
portion
of
the
on
sale
bar
should
not
be
read
to
allow
the
inventor
to
control
the
time
when
the
period
starts
to
run
by
deciding
when
he
or
she
will
reduce
it
to
practice,
or
he
or
she
will
deliver
the
goods.
you
have
run
counter
to
that
fundamental
policy...
let
me
suggest
that
the
entire
reduction
to
practice
notion
is
a
notion
that
has
grown
up
not
in
the
on
sale
bar
clause
area
at
all.
we
have
two
major
categories
of
conditions
when
you
look
at
102.
the
first
category
of
condition
let's
call
priority,
because
it
says,
let's
look
at
the
time
of
invention
and
decide
at
that
point
in
time
what
was
the
state
of
the
art,
what
was
already
out
there?
is
this
something
novel,
or
was
it
already
there?
that's
what
we
look
at
in
102(a),
that's
what
we
look
at
in
102(b),
that's
what
we
look
at
in
102(g).
in
the
priority
cases,
the
way
the
law
has
developed,
and
it's
developed
appropriately,
i
think,
we
definitely
have,
as
the
question
to
establish
this
morning,
we
look
at
when
the
invention
was
made
in
terms
of
when
was
the
conception
complete?
we
have
always
done
that
at
least
since
the
middle
of
the
last
century.
so
when
we're
asking
that
question,
we
encourage,
of
course
inventors
to
remember
as
well
as
they
can
how
far
back
the
invention
went,
and
in
that
situation
this
court
has
always
been,
and
other
courts
have
been
properly
skeptical
of
the
mere
memory
of
the
inventor
as
to
how
far
back
he
actually
thought
through
this
invention.
so
the
courts
developed
this
notion
of
a
reduction
to
practice,
and
the
reduction
to
practice
helps
confirm
as
a
matter
of
proof
that
not
only
was
there
a
conception,
but
that
within
a
reasonable
time...
this
is
the
notion
of
diligence
to
reduce
to
practice.
within
a
reasonable
time
we
can
see
the
actual
invention
or
the
patent
application,
one
of
those
two
things.
mr.
c.
randall
bain
and
that
happens
as
a
matter
of
proof.
mr.
c.
randall
bain
well,
number
1,
i
want
to
point
out
that
as
a
practical
matter--
mr.
c.
randall
bain
--it's
easy
to
handle
by
contract,
is
the
short
answer.
but
i
want
to
point
out
that
it's
very
rare
when
you're
going
to
get
a
contract...
i
think
relatively
rare,
anyway,
when
you're
going
to
get
a
contract
that
describes
the
invention.
remember
the
invention,
let's
think
of
it
in
terms
of
a
combination
of
a,
b,
c,
and
d.
it's
a
combination
of
those
elements.
that's
your
invention.
you
don't
normally
sell
things
in
terms,
i
want
to
sell
you
a
combination
of
a,
b,
c,
and
d.
you
sell
something
that
performs
x
function
and
y
function,
and
that,
when
you
have
a
contract
that
simply
says
i'm
going
to
sell
you
a
device
that
performs
x
function
or
y
function--
mr.
c.
randall
bain
--yes.
then
i
would
say
you
do
not
have
a
contract
that
puts
the
invention
on
sale.
indeed,
in
your
example
you
don't
know
what
the
invention
is
yet,
because
the
invention
is
what
you
finally
settle
on,
but
you
said
you're
going
to
probably
change
it
as
you
go
along,
so
what
is
on
sale
at
that...
what
has
been
put
on
sale
on
that
point
may
not
be
the
invention
at
all.
mr.
c.
randall
bain
i
think
that's
correct,
your
honor.
you
have
to
put
the
invention
on
sale.
mr.
c.
randall
bain
it's
not
just
any
old
product
on
sale.
mr.
c.
randall
bain
oh,
i...
then
that's
a
different
case.
mr.
c.
randall
bain
if
you
both
know
that,
then
you
have
the
invention
on
sale,
if
that
turns
out
to
be
the
invention.
mr.
c.
randall
bain
with
all
due
respect,
your
honor,
most
of
the
inventions
today
in
our
more
complex
world
are
little
pieces
of
products.
they're
not
whole
products.
this
happened
to
be
a
whole
product,
but
most
of
the
time
it's
little
pieces
of
product,
and
we
buy
computers,
or
we
buy
machines
that
have
maybe
10
different
inventions
in
them.
when
we
buy
them,
we
are
buying
what
will
they
do
for
us,
not
do
they
have
element
a,
b,
and
c,
in
this
part.
mr.
c.
randall
bain
no,
i
don't
think
so,
your
honor,
but
our
rule
would
look--
mr.
c.
randall
bain
--number
1,
i
want
to
point
out
that
he
would
have
a
year
anyway.
that
works--
mr.
c.
randall
bain
--yes.
mr.
c.
randall
bain
well,
let
me
make
clear
as
to
what
test
we're
proposing,
and
perhaps
it
will
help
to
answer
that
question.
we
are
asking
for
the
test
that
we
think
patent
lawyers
and
inventors
are
most
familiar
with,
which
is,
when
am
i
ready
to
patent
my
invention?
that's
what
has
to
be
answered
every
time
we
decide
to
go
for
a
patent,
so
in
your
example
the
inventor
would
have
to
say
to
himself,
do
i
have
an
invention
yet
that
i
am
ready
to
go
for
patent
on,
and
is
it
going
to
get
incorporated
into
this
product?
if
it
does
so,
and
if
he
has
a
sale,
then
he
knows
with
certainty
that
the
clock
is
starting
to
run
on
his
1
year
grace
period,
and
he
then
has
a
full
year
to
get
his
patent
application
filed.
mr.
c.
randall
bain
i'm
sorry,
i
misunderstood
that--
mr.
c.
randall
bain
--you
need
both
elements.
mr.
c.
randall
bain
yes.
mr.
c.
randall
bain
i'm
very
sorry,
i
would
have
said...
and
i
missed
that
point.
i
want
to
make
one
little
point
clear,
and
that
is,
there's
a
slight
difference
between
the
test
that
the
solicitor
general
has...
suggests
and
the
test
that
we
suggest.
we
suggest
the
ready
for
patenting
test,
and
so
ours
is
a
prospective
test,
and
so
when
the
invention
is
ready
for
patenting
and
on
sale
both
the
period
starts
to
run,
as
opposed
to
the
solicitor
general
test,
which
is
a
retrospective
test,
as
i
understand
it,
although
he
can
certainly
speak
for
himself,
but
that's
a
retrospective
test,
so
after
the
fact
you
look
back
and
say,
well,
in
fact,
was
what
turned
out
to
be
the
invention
on
sale
more
than
1
year
in
advance.
there's
a
slight
difference,
and
it
only
makes
a
difference
in
those
cases
i
think
close
to
the
example
you
had
where
the
invention
really
isn't
complete
yet
the
full
year
before
the
filing
for
patent,
we
really
don't
have
an
invention
yet,
but
if
we
just
do
the
pure
retrospective
test,
you
may
not
get
your
full
year.
and
that's
the
reason
we
believe
that
the
ready
for
patenting
test
is
a
superior
test,
and
should
be
applied
by
the
court,
and
we
believe
that's
a
test
which
brings
a
very
substantial
amount
of
certainty,
and
certainly
we
don't
believe
that
reduction
to
practice
brings
a
large
quantity
of
certainty.
there
will
always
be
uncertainty,
because
we
will
always
have
mixed
fact
patterns,
but
reduction
to
practice--
mr.
c.
randall
bain
--absolutely.
you
must
have
both
elements.
you
must
have
at
least
an
offer
for
sale
that
has
taken
place,
as
well
as
the
invention
being
in
existence.
mr.
c.
randall
bain
well,
i
think
that
it
still
remains
a
very
important
bar,
but
the
fact
is
that
the
way
sales
are
made,
very
often
the
buyer
does
not
in
fact
know
what's
all
the
elements
of
a
complex
system
that
is
being
purchased,
so
in
that
sense--
mr.
c.
randall
bain
--i
submit
that
the
sale
has
to
relate
to
that
invention
if
he's
particular...
if
he's
free,
if
the
seller
is
free,
the
inventor
is
free
to
change
it
as
he
goes
along.
in
this
case,
that
wasn't
so.
the
contract
was
made
with
reference
to
drawing
2020,
or
some
particular
drawing,
but
if
the
inventor
were
free
to
continue
to
change
this
product
as
he
goes
along,
which
is
not
uncommon,
then
i
would
submit
that
you
don't
have
the
invention
on
sale.
mr.
c.
randall
bain
but
if...
well,
if
you
have
the
sample,
i
think
you're
plainly
on
sale.
i
don't
think
it's
purely
subjective,
and
i
may
have
overstated
a
little
bit.
mr.
c.
randall
bain
where
you
have
something
under
development--
mr.
c.
randall
bain
--if
it
has...
if
it
has
been...
if
it's
on
hand,
as
the
old
cases
once
required,
then,
of
course,
you're
buying
that
thing
that
contains
the
invention.
but
if--
mr.
c.
randall
bain
--if
i'm
simply--
mr.
c.
randall
bain
--thank
you,
your
honor.
