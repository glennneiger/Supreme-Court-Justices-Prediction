mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court--
the
united
states
submits
that
section
102(b)
of
the
patent
act
requires
the
inventor
to
apply
for
a
patent
within
1
year
of
placing
his
invention
on
sale,
regardless
of
whether
he
has
reduced
it
to
practice.
we
think
the
statutory
language
dictates
that
result.
section
102(b)
states,
of
course,
that
a
inventor
is
not
entitled
to
a
patent
unless
the
invention
was...
or
if
the
invention
was
on
sale
on
the
critical
date.
the
statute's
use
of
the
term,
invention,
in
that
context--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--it
means
it
has
been--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--it
has
been
offered
for
sale,
or
has
been
advertised
in
such
a
way
that
the
inventor
would
accept
offers
to
buy.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
we
think
that's
a--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--no,
we
don't
think
the
buyer
needs
to
know
that
information.
we
think
that
the
seller
is
in
control
of
what's
on
sale,
and
we
look
to
what
the
seller's
actually
offering
for
sale.
now--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--it's
very
important.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
well,
i
don't
agree
with
mr.
bain's
response
in
that
context.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
our
view
is
simply
this,
that
section
102(b),
when
it
uses
the
term
invention,
is
referring
to
the
item,
the
product
that
is
identified
in
the
patent
application,
and
that
leads
to
quite
a
natural
test
in
these
cases.
the
on
sale
bar
applies
if
the
product
that
is
offered
for
sale
is
the
same
product
that's
identified
in
the
patent
application.
now,
in
the
case
where
the
inventor
has
created
a
physical
embodiment
of
the
invention,
that
test
will
be
very
easy
to
apply.
we
think
it's
also
easy
to
apply--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--well,
i
think--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--justice
kennedy,
i'd
like
to
answer
your
question
from
two
perspectives.
let's
look
first
at
what
the
inventor
understands
under
our
test,
and
that
is,
if
he
has
conceived
of
an
invention,
if
he's
ready
to
patent
it,
then
he
knows
he
has
1
year
from
the
date
he
places
it
on
sale
to
apply
for
that
patent,
and
that's
a
clear
rule
for
him.
he
knows
at
that
point
that
once
i
say,
eureka,
i
know
what
i
want
to
do
here,
i
understand
it,
i
can
reduce
it
to
practice,
i
can
make
an
enabling
disclosure,
then
he
knows
if
he
offers
it
for
sale
the
clock
is
ticking,
and
he
has
1
year
to
get
that
patent
application
in.
now,
the
case
is
also
going
to
arise,
in
the
case
such
as
we
have
here,
where
a
party
is
seeking
to
invalidate
the
patent...
and
his
perspective
is
going
to
be
quite
different
on
it.
he's
going
to
look
at
what
proof
do
i
have
that
the
inventor
had
placed
this
item
on
sale,
and
it
really
is
an
evidentiary
question
at
that
point
in
terms
of
whether
what
was
on
sale
was
what
was
ultimately
identified
in
the
patent.
for
instance,
a
simple
case
of
this
is
the
mechanical
drawing
situation
we
have
here.
we
think
this
case
is
clearly
covered
by
our
test.
what
the
challenger
says
is,
look,
we
know
this
was
on
sale
because
the
engineering
diagrams
that
you
prepared
and
submitted
to
the
purchaser
are
the
very
same
diagrams
that
we
submitted
with
the
application
of
a
patent.
now,
the
question
that
you're
concerned
with,
i
believe,
is
the
situation
of,
well,
what
if
there's
a
change
along
the
way
as
the
product
is
developed,
and
certainly
that's
commonplace
in
today's
commercial
markets,
that
there'd
be
the
back
and
forth,
the
interchange
between
the
buyer
and
seller
that
might
lead
to
modifications
of
the
product.
if
it's
an
obvious
change,
then
the
same
bar
applies.
we
simply
apply
the
so
called
obviousness
test
to
the
item
that
was
originally
offered
for
sale.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
well,
the
inventor
should
know
whether
or
not
he
has
an
invention,
whether
or
not
he's
prepared
to
submit
a
patent
application
and,
if
he
is,
then
he
knows
if
he
puts
it
on
sale
the
clock
is
going
to
be
running.
now,
it
might
be
that
he
finds
an
improvement
to
this
invention,
that
he
actually
sees
a
way
to
make
it
better,
or
to
improve
it.
in
that
case
the
clock
might
start
running
again,
because
he
has
in
effect
a
new
invention.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
that
is
correct.
that's
how
these
rules
operate,
and
it's
important
to
see
that
this
is...
it
places
the
control
over
the
on
sale
bar
within
the
hands
of
the
inventor.
once
the
inventor
knows
what
rule
applies,
he
can
act
accordingly.
the
question
also
arose
with
regard
to
what
if,
if
what
the
inventor
is
really
selling
is,
shall
we
describe
as
a
half
baked
idea.
he's
offering
something
for
sale,
but
he
hasn't
fully
formulated
in
that
situation.
now,
the
inventor
that
does
that
runs
a
risk
that
someone
might
say
that,
well,
in
fact,
you
knew
what
you
were
selling,
and
the
on
sale
bar
should
apply.
he
can
protect
himself
in
that
situation
simply
by
providing
in
the
terms
of
the
contract
that
he
is
providing
development
services,
or
an
r&d
contract,
or
he's
entering
into
a
joint
ventureship
with
the
party
for
whom
he's
developing
this.
the
uncertainty
can
be
resolved
by
the
inventor
simply
by
foresight.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
well,--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--because
that's
not
the
only
thing
that's
operating
in
this
marketplace.
the
inventor
also
has
to
be
concerned
about
the
possibility
that
other
inventors
might
come
along
to
claim
the
same
invention.
now,
if
he
wants
to
protect
himself
and
protect
his
priority,
then
he's
going
to
need
to
do
one
of
several
things.
1)
he's
going
to
have
to
actually
reduce
to
practice...
there
is
this
incentive
to
encourage
people
to
reduce
to
practice...
or
he's
going
to
file
a
patent
application
ahead
of
time.
the
marketplace
itself
actually
polices
this
in
very
important
ways,
because
the
inventor,
if
he
wants
to
take
advantage
of
the
patent
system,
he
does
have
to
move
quickly
and
clarify
what
he's
selling.
what's
more,
the
marketplace
also
encourages
the
proper
use
of
our
tests
because,
as
you
said,
justice
scalia,
a
buyer
is
not
going
to
buy
a
pig
in
a
poke.
he's
going
to
want
to
know
what
he's
bought.
he's
going
to
want
a
description,
much
as
wells
wanted...
or
not
wells,
excuse
me,
the
texas
instrument
wanted
in
this
case.
they
did
want
to
see
a
diagram
of
what
was
being
sold,
and
their
contract
specified
they
wanted
the
product
that
they
saw
in
the
diagram.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
sure.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
that
is
correct.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
that
is
correct.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
i
think
certainly--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--yes.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
i
think
that's
right,
including
the
last
one.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
that,
we
think,
is
a
question
of
evidence,
and
that's
handled
by
the
presumptions
that
already
exist.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
we
think
it
is
an
improvement,
because...
our
test
is
an
improvement
because
it
puts
the
inventor
on
clear
notice
of
exactly
what
the
test
is.
the
problem
we
see
with
the
federal
circuit's
test
is,
it
is
a
substantially
completed
test
that
we
think
is
less
clear
than
the
test
we're
proposing.
thank
you.
