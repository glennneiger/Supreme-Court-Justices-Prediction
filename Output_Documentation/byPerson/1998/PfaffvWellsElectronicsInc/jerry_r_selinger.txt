mr.
jerry
r.
selinger
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court--
the
federal
circuit
held
that
wayne
pfaff
had
forfeited
his
right
to
a
patent
because
he
had
violated
the
on
sale
bar
provision.
the
appellate
court
reached
that
conclusion
because
it
failed
to
construe
the
statute
properly.
properly
construed,
the
grace
period
of
the
on
sale
bar
provision
cannot
start
until
there
is
an
invention
fully
completed
by
reduction
to
practice.
there
are
three
reasons
why
the
statute
should
be
so
construed.
first,
for
many
decades
the
regional
appellate
circuits
consistently
had
construed
the
on
sale
bar
provision
to
require
at
least
reduction
to
practice.
that
body
of
judicial
authority
spans
two
relevant
reenactments
of
the
on
sale
bar
provision.
second,
the
policy
balance
selected
by
congress
in
1839
for
the
on
sale
bar
provision
emphasized
that
inventors
were
to
have
an
easy
to
calculate
period
of
limitations
based
on
an
event
of
significance
to
inventors.
mr.
jerry
r.
selinger
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
jerry
r.
selinger
an
invention
has
to
be
reduced
to
practice...
the
answer
is
yes,
your
honor,
either
through--
mr.
jerry
r.
selinger
--the
court
in
dolbear
recognized
that
one
could
have
a
constructive
reduction
to
practice
by
the
filing
of
a
patent
application
that
met
the
standards
of
disclosure
in
112
in
novelty,
in
102
in
nonobviousness,
in
103--
mr.
jerry
r.
selinger
--yes.
mr.
jerry
r.
selinger
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
jerry
r.
selinger
the...
the
answer
is
yes,
your
honor.
the--
mr.
jerry
r.
selinger
--the
reason
it
should
not,
your
honor,
is
because
the
statute
says
the
invention
was
on
sale.
it
doesn't
say
the
invention
was
conceived.
going
back
to
the
alexander
milburn
case,
about
half
way
through
that
decision
the
court
made
it
clear
that
the
person
who
had
described
in
his
patent
but
not
claimed
was
not
in
fact
the
inventor
for
the
description
purpose,
and
the
answer
is,
in
going
on
just
further,
conception
is
always
the
first
step,
but
as
this
court
has
said
in
a
number
of
cases
going
back
to
corona
cord,
symington,
and
starting
back
in
earlier
cases,
conception
is
the
first
step,
reduction
to
practice
is
when
you
show
that
something
really
will
work.
mr.
jerry
r.
selinger
well,
to--
mr.
jerry
r.
selinger
--well,
to
understand
the
purpose
i
think
we
need
to
go
back
briefly
through
the
history,
your
honor,
and
the
patent
act
of
1793
as
construed
by
this
court
in
pennock
v.
dialogue
provided
no
grace
period
in
that
an
application
had
to
be
filed
before
there
was
public
use
or
public
sale
for
use.
that
situation
lasted
legislatively
for
only
3
years,
from
1836
to
1839,
when
congress
created
a
2
year
grace
period,
and
this
court
in
andrews
v.
hovey
then
explained
that
the
evident
purpose
of
congress
was
twofold.
one
point
is
to
create
a
period
of
limitations
which
should
be
certain.
we're
dealing
with
property
rights.
we're
dealing
with
forfeiture
of
property
rights,
and
the
court
in
andrews
emphasized
that
there
should
be
a
clear
line.
mr.
jerry
r.
selinger
well,
your
honor,
when
you
have
a
conception,
you
have
a
piece
of
paper--
mr.
jerry
r.
selinger
--no.
mr.
jerry
r.
selinger
it's
not.
mr.
jerry
r.
selinger
it's
a
contract
to
deliver
something
that
may
exist
in
the
future,
something
that
may
or
may
not
actually
work
when
you
go
from
conception
to
reduction
to
practice.
that's
why
this
court,
throughout
the
1800's
and
into
the
1900's,
has
required
both
conception
and
reduction
to
practice.
mr.
jerry
r.
selinger
no,
you
cannot.
mr.
jerry
r.
selinger
you
have...
you
do
not,
your
honor.
you
have
an
invention
either
when
you
actually
build
and
test
and
make
sure
the
device
will
work
for
its
intended
purpose,
or
when
you
file
your
patent
application
with
claims,
in
which
case
you
have
constructive
reduction
to
practice.
mr.
jerry
r.
selinger
no.
that's
fairly
common,
your
honor.
i'm
not
sure
there
are
any
statistics
on
it,
but
it
does
happen
and
it's
not
infrequent.
those
are
called
paper
patents,
and
found
throughout
the
literature.
mr.
jerry
r.
selinger
that's
correct.
mr.
jerry
r.
selinger
i
think
the
first
part
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
jerry
r.
selinger
for
con...
for
the
application.
mr.
jerry
r.
selinger
that's
correct.
now,
what
would
be
wrong
with
curing...
all
the
bars
are
telling
us
is
vagueness
on
the
part
of
the
federal
circuit
by
just
saying,
that's
what
you
have
to
have,
what
i
just
read.
in
other
words,
the
time
period
starts
to
run
when
you
satisfy
the
three
conditions
and
either
you
have
reduced
it
to
practice
or
you
have
written
it
down
in
such
detail
that
a
skilled
artisan
would
be
able
to
practice
the
invention.
now,
if
we
simply
copy
that
right
out
of
his
brief,
right
into
the
opinion,
and
say
that's
what
you
have
to
have,
what
would
be
wrong
with
that?
your
client
might
lose,
so
i
think
you'd
be
against
it,
but
that's
why
i'm
asking
the
question.
what's
wrong
with
that?
you've
got
the
certainty,
it's...
it
isn't
total,
you
have
to
reduce
it
to
practice,
but
it
surely
follows
the
idea
that
the
statute
picks
up
from
invention,
patentability,
et
cetera.
there
are
four
problems
with
that,
your
honor.
the
first
is,
i
don't
believe
it
is
consistent
with
the
statute,
with
the
intent
of
congress.
mr.
jerry
r.
selinger
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
jerry
r.
selinger
that's
correct.
mr.
jerry
r.
selinger
for
purpose...
in
the
absence
of
a
completed
device,
your
honor,
a
contract
alone
is
irrelevant.
returning
to
your
honor's
question,
the
second
answer
is,
the
suggestion
from
the
solicitor
general
i
think
is
superficially
clear
but
is
very
complicated
and
does
not
create
a
bright
line
test
in
practice.
the
third
problem
it
has
is,
it
creates
a
huge
reservoir
of
secret
prior
art
usable
against
third
parties,
and
i
think
the
fourth
reason
is
that
it
subverts
the
public
interest.
let
me
go
back
to
those.
it's
theoretically
interesting
to
explain
that
when
you
have
a
piece
of
paper
and
you
actually
describe
something
that
ought
to
start
the
clock.
the
problem
is
that
may
not
be
what
you
end
up
with
as
a
real
product.
i
may
think
i'm
6
months
from
developing
a
new
fuel
additive
which
will
reduce
pollution
by
50
percent,
and
if
i'm
a
small
company
i
can
then...
i
may
want
to
enter
into
a
distribution
contract
with
a
large
company
to
get
that
into
the
market,
but
i
may
be
wrong.
it
may
take
me,
and
i
may
be
able
to
write
the
details
of
that
additive
ad
nauseam,
but
it
may
turn
out,
when
i
actually
get
my
trials,
when
i
actually
try
to
see
if
it
works
for
its
intended
purpose,
it
doesn't,
and
i've
got
to
go
back
to
the
laboratory.
i
may
have
to
change
composition.
my
description
may
change--
mr.
jerry
r.
selinger
--your
honor,
the
risk--
mr.
jerry
r.
selinger
--i
think
it
would
be
contrary
to
public
interest
to
tell
patentees
that
not
only
could
they
be
in
breach
of
contract
but
they
would
risk
losing
their
patent
rights
if
their
contract
wasn't
drafted
carefully.
mr.
jerry
r.
selinger
it
does
indeed.
mr.
jerry
r.
selinger
what's
wrong
with
that,
your
honor,
are
exactly
the
problems
i
was
explaining
to
his
honor,
and
there
are
four
problems.
it's
the
same...
the
solicitor
general
is
promoting
judge
bryson's
test,
and
the
problems
are
that
it's
not
a
bright
line
test
because
when
you
move--
mr.
jerry
r.
selinger
--your
honor,
i
have
to
disagree,
and
to
the
extent
that
the
bryson
formulation
purports
to,
it
does
so
years
after
the
fact,
and
it
requires
looking
at
what
was
offered
for
sale.
it's
not
clear
whether
or
not
the
bryson
formula
requires
anything
to
exist,
something
as
broad
as,
i
offer
to
sell
you
my
new
cure
for
arthritis.
whether
that
starts
the
clock--
mr.
jerry
r.
selinger
--absolutely,
your
honor.
mr.
jerry
r.
selinger
absolutely,
and
going
back
to--
mr.
jerry
r.
selinger
--for
many
years,
your
honor,
the
on
hand
test
was
part
of
the
on
sale
bar
provision
in
a
number
of
circuits,
and
that
was
in
fact
the
situation.
the
product
had
to
be
on
hand
before
the
on
sale
bar
could
start
to
run.
that
wasn't
the
rule
in
all
circuits,
but
every
circuit
that
considered
the
on
sale
bar
required
at
least
reduction
to
practice.
mr.
jerry
r.
selinger
a
product
can
be
on
sale
under
the
law
without
there
actually
being
a
sale
if
there
is
a
product.
in
fact,
part
of
the
purpose
of
the
on
sale
provision
is
to
allow
inventors
to
test
the
salability
of
the
product
after
they
have
it,
and
something
that
doesn't
sell
during
the
1
year
grace
period
that
the
inventors
are
given
tells
the
inventor,
don't
file
a
patent
application.
mr.
jerry
r.
selinger
if
it
was
100
years
early,
i
would
be
arguing
that.
i
don't
under
the
jurisprudence
since
then.
but
let
me
go
to
reduction
to
practice
for
just
a
minute.
mr.
jerry
r.
selinger
yes.
either--
mr.
jerry
r.
selinger
--absolutely.
10--
mr.
jerry
r.
selinger
--in--
mr.
jerry
r.
selinger
--yes,
and
i
meant
one
of
the
two
ways.
that's...
those
are
both
termed...
called
reduction
to
practice.
mr.
jerry
r.
selinger
no,
your
honor.
perhaps
i
misspoke.
you
don't
have
to
actually
reduce
it
to
practice.
the
courts
have
created
a
fiction
which
is--
mr.
jerry
r.
selinger
--that's
correct.
that's
correct.
mr.
jerry
r.
selinger
that's
correct
and,
in
fact,
you
can
get
a
patent
and
the
patent
can
live
out
its
life
and
product
never
be
made.
there
are
many
inventors--
mr.
jerry
r.
selinger
--i
equate
invention
with
some
form
of
reduction
to
practice
as
i
use
it,
not
as
your
honor
uses
it.
in
your
honor's
case
invention
would
either
be
actual
reduction
to
practice
or
the
filing
of
an
appropriate
patent
application.
mr.
jerry
r.
selinger
your
honor,
in
subsection
(g)
is
when
congress
codified
the
longstanding
definition,
but
reduction
to
practice
has
been
recognized
by
this
court
in
considering
when
there
was
an
invention
going
back
to
the
1800's.
for
example,
in
seymour--
mr.
jerry
r.
selinger
--your
honor,
i...
then
perhaps
i
wasn't
clear.
to
have
an
invention,
you
have
to
either
have
a
device
actually
made,
or...
which
is
an
actual
reduction
to
practice
and
tested,
or
the
court
has
created
a
fiction
that
the
filing
of
a
patent
application
is
a
constructive
reduction
to
practice.
without
either
of
those
two
acts
there
cannot
be
an
invention.
mr.
jerry
r.
selinger
that's
right,
and
subsection
(g)
sets
forth
how
one
decides--
mr.
jerry
r.
selinger
--that's
not
correct,
your
honor.
without...
because
subsection
(g)
in
that
last
clause
assumes
there
is
a
reduction
to
practice.
if
you
don't
have
a
reduction
to
practice,
you
don't
have
invention.
mr.
jerry
r.
selinger
your
honor,
i'm
not
sure
i
agree,
because
102(g)
says,
normally
it's
the
first
to
conceive,
first
to
reduce.
mr.
jerry
r.
selinger
the
first
to
conceive
but
the
last
to
reduce--
mr.
jerry
r.
selinger
--i'm
paraphrasing,
your
honor.
the
first
to
conceive
and
the
last
to
reduce
to
practice
can
be
the
first
inventor.
mr.
jerry
r.
selinger
if
diligence
is
exercised
from
the
time
prior
to
its
conception
all
the
way
through
reduction
to
practice.
you
have
to
have
both
elements
for
the
invention.
mr.
jerry
r.
selinger
no.
you're
the
first
inventor
because
you
have
pursued
the
inventive
process
in
the
order
that
congress
has
said
is
the
appropriate
way
to
make
you
the
first
inventor.
but
until
you
have
that
reduction
to
practice...
if
you're
diligent
and
you
quit
2
days
before
reduction
to
practice
you're
not
the
inventor.
you
have
to
have
reduction
to
practice.
mr.
jerry
r.
selinger
yes.
going
back
to
the
question,
your
honor,
the
situation
where
you
can't
tell
whether
or
not
what's
on
paper
is
going
to
work
or
not
may
or
may
not
start
the
clock,
as...
and
there's
a
policy
interest,
and
that...
the
problem
with
turning
the
piece
of
paper
in
connection
with
efforts
to
get
a
distribution
agreement
set
in
place
before
you've
actually
made
something,
if
you
say
that
is
the
sale,
because
you
have
the
detail
of
something
that
may
not
work,
but
it's
in
detail--
mr.
jerry
r.
selinger
--it
treated
that
as
on
sale.
mr.
jerry
r.
selinger
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
jerry
r.
selinger
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
jerry
r.
selinger
no.
i'm
saying
that
until
there
was
an
actual
reduction
to
practice--
mr.
jerry
r.
selinger
--that's
right.
that's
when
they--
mr.
jerry
r.
selinger
--yes.
not
that
the...
when
the
items
were
actually
made,
which
also
was
in
july,
there
was
an
actual
reduction
to
practice
and
they
were
tested,
and
at
that
point--
mr.
jerry
r.
selinger
--well,
your
honor--
mr.
jerry
r.
selinger
--i
did
not
mean
to
say
on
sale
required
delivery.
mr.
jerry
r.
selinger
no.
on--
mr.
jerry
r.
selinger
--no.
i
thought
i
said
there
had
to
be
an
actual
product
at
the
same
time,
your
honor.
there
are
two
components.
there's
the
invention
component,
and
there's
the
on
sale
component.
the
statute
requires
that
there
be
an
invention,
and
that
invention
be
on
sale,
and
i'm
sorry,
your
honor,
i
was
focusing
on
the
two
components
and
may
have
blended
them
together,
but
there
has
to
be
something
which
is
the
invention.
it
has
to
exist.
mr.
jerry
r.
selinger
that's
correct.
mr.
jerry
r.
selinger
the
filing
of
the
application
is
a
constructive
reduction
to
practice.
that's
the
way
the
courts
have
treated
it.
mr.
jerry
r.
selinger
if
that's
the
court's
definition,
then
i
will
live
with
that
definition.
mr.
jerry
r.
selinger
if
i
may
just
go
back
to
the
fourth
point,
as
judge
easterbrook
noted,
sitting
as
the
district
court
in
the
mahurkar
case,
as
the
dissents
noted
in
umc
and
atlantic
thermoplastics,
it's
very
common...
it's
important
for
inventors
to
communicate
with
customers.
this
not
only
helps
during
the
inventive
process
of
making
the
best
product,
getting
a
better
product
to
the
public,
but
it
also
allows
inventors,
as
i
was
describing
earlier,
to
get
the
product
there
sooner
rather
than
later,
and
it's
in
the
public
interest
to
allow
inventors
to
communicate
with
prospective
customers.
a
bright
line
rule,
based
on...
reduction
to
practice
is
something
inventors--
mr.
jerry
r.
selinger
--that...
of
course
that
could
work
prospectively,
but
going
back
to
my
earlier
comment,
your
honor,
what
that
would
do
is
place
inventors
not
only
at
risk
of
breach
of
contract
if
they
didn't
act
timely,
but
if
the
contract
wasn't
done
properly,
based
on
the
court's
new
ruling,
inventors
would
be
also
faced
with
the
risk
of
the
loss
of
their
invention,
their
patentable
invention,
and
that,
i
think,
is
not
the
intent
of
congress.
that
wasn't
the
intent
in
1839.
it
wasn't
the
intent
in
1939.
mr.
jerry
r.
selinger
may
i
respond,
your
honor?
there
are...
that's
certainly
what
bonito
boats
said,
and
the
second
circuit
had
that
comment,
but
we
need
to
place
that
in
its
proper
context,
and
there's
two
parts.
first,
judge
hand
was
trying
to
decide
whether
to
reverse
a
line
of
cases
dealing
with
a
machine
which
was
working,
was
kept
in
secret,
was
making
parts
that
were
on
sale,
and
judge
hand
was
trying
to
decide
if
a
real
machine,
secretly
working
for
a
great
deal
of
time--
