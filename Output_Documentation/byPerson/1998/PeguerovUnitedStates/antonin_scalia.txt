well,
it
may
or
may
not,
and...
and
with
other
structural
errors,
you
can't
tell
whether
it
does
or
not.
but
in
this
situation
you
can
tell
whether
it
did
or
not.
if,
in
fact,
he
knew
of
his
entitlement
to
an
appeal,
it
did
not.
justice
antonin
scalia
if...
if
we
applied
that
test
to
all
harmless
error
determinations,
that
is
to
say,
you
can
only
say
there
is
harmless
area...
error
when
you
know...
i
mean,
you
never
know
for
100
percent
certainty.
in
harmless
error
determinations,
you...
you...
you
make
an
assessment
which
is,
you
know,
always...
there's
always
some
scintilla
of
a
doubt
left
in
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
just
think
it's
unrealistic
to
say
he
knew
about
this
right
to
appeal,
but
if
the
judge
told
him
what
he
already
knew,
there
might
have
been
a
different
outcome.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
i
can't
say
no.
i
can't
say
it's
impossible.
it
just
seems
to
me
very,
very,
very
unlikely.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
rule
is
there
so
that
we
don't
have
to
inquire
into
whether
he
knew
about
it
all
the
time.
justice
antonin
scalia
we
may
have
to
in
some
exceptional
case
such
as
this,
but
99
percent
of
the
cases
are
taken
out
of
that
situation
by
the
fact
that
on
the
record
the
judge
asked
him
and
he
says
no.
but
that
doesn't
speak
to
the
fact
of
when
the
judge
makes
a
mistake,
do
we
have
to
assume,
even
when
he
knew
about
that
same
thing,
that
somehow
this...
this
impaired
his
right
to
appeal.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes.
i'm
not
sure
what
cases.
these
cases
presumably
are
cases
that
held
that
even
without
a
rule
that
said
so,
if
you
did
not
advise
the
defendant
of
his
right
to
appeal--
justice
antonin
scalia
--right.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
think
he's
making
that
as
a...
as
a
factual
claim
here.
i
think--
justice
antonin
scalia
i
think
that's
one
of
the
grounds
on
which
he
says
you
should
have
a
categorical
rule
because
this
is
one
of
the
things
that
might
happen.
it's
one
of
the
reasons
for
it.
