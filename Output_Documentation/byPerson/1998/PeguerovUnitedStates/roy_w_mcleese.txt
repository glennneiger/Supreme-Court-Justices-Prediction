mr.
roy
w.
mcleese
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
under
rule
32,
the
district
court
should
have
informed
petitioner
at
sentencing
that
he
had
a
right
to
appeal,
but
petitioner
knew
he
had
a
right
to
appeal
and
so
he
was
not
prejudiced
by
the
district
court's
failure
to
tell
him
what
he
independently
knew.
petitioner
is,
therefore,
not
entitled
to
collateral
relief.
to
obtain
collateral
relief,
petitioner
would
have
to
establish
a
fundamental
defect
which
inherently
results
in
a
complete
miscarriage
of
justice.
mr.
roy
w.
mcleese
yes,
in
the
context
of--
mr.
roy
w.
mcleese
--no,
justice
souter.
in
the
context
of
rule
11,
as
well
in
this
court's
decision
in
timmreck,
the
burden
upon
a
defendant
who
is
alleging
the
violation
of
a
rule
of
criminal
procedure,
as
a
basis
for
collateral
relief,
is
on
the
petitioner
to
establish
that
that
violation
was
prejudicial
to
him.
mr.
roy
w.
mcleese
11(h)
is
a
provision
which
relates
to
direct
appeal,
and
in
circumstances
when
a
defendant
is
noting
a
direct
appeal
from
his...
the
adjudication
of
guilt
and
ensuing
sentence
on
the
ground
that
there
was
a
deviation
from
the
requirements
of
rule
11,
the
burden
is
on
the
government
to
show
the
harmlessness
of
the
error.
but
when
we
move
over
into
a
collateral
proceeding,
the
burdens
shift.
for
example,
this
court's
decision
in
brecht
v.
abrahamson
imposed...
held
that
the
chapman
standard,
which
normally
applies
to
determine
the
harmlessness
of
a
constitutional
error--
mr.
roy
w.
mcleese
--yes.
so,
the
burdens
alter
in
the
collateral
context,
and
this
court's
decisions
beginning
as
far
back
as
hill
and
carrying
through
up
to
reed
v.
farley
have
made
clear
that
when
a
defendant
is
seeking
collateral
relief
on
the
ground
not
of
a
constitutional
violation
or
even
of
a
statute,
but
a
violation
of
a
rule
of
procedure,
that
the
burden
is
on
the
defendant
to
establish
that
he
was
prejudiced
by
that--
mr.
roy
w.
mcleese
--yes.
the...
the
lower
courts
who
have...
there
are
a
myriad
of
cases
in
which
courts
of
appeals
have
confronted
collateral
claims,
2255
motions,
in
which
defendants
have
alleged
deviations
from
the...
the
very
complex
and
numerous
requirements
of
rule
11.
and
in
that
context,
the
courts
of
appeals
have
consistently
held
that
the
burden
is
on
the
defendant
to
establish
prejudice,
and
they
frequently
hold
hearings
where
the
defendant--
mr.
roy
w.
mcleese
--he
has
10
days.
mr.
roy
w.
mcleese
two
responses.
if
a
defendant
brings
the
matter
to
the
court's
attention
within
a
very
brief
time
after
sentencing,
the
rules
provide
for
the
noting
of
an
appeal
somewhat
out
of
time--
mr.
roy
w.
mcleese
--in
a
2255
proceeding,
if
the...
the
defendant
alleged
that
he
was
unaware
of
his
right
to
appeal
because
the
judge
failed
to
comply
with
the
requirements
of
rule
32
and
because
the
defense
attorney
failed
to
provide
that
information
as
well,
and
that
allegation
was
not
factually
disputed
by
the
government
or
it
was
taken
up
at
a
hearing
and
determined
adversely
to
the
government
or
in
favor
of
the
defendant,
our
position
is
that
a
defendant
would
be
entitled
to
relief--
mr.
roy
w.
mcleese
--no.
this
court's
decision
in
rodriquez
and
subsequent
decisions
as
well
of
this
court
i
think
make
clear
that
the
complete
loss
off
right
to
appeal
is
a
form
of
prejudice
that
will
entitle
you
to
relief,
collateral
or
otherwise,
without
regard
to
whether
you
in
fact
have
presently
established
that
you
have
meritorious
claims.
mr.
roy
w.
mcleese
i
should
add
the
qualification
derived
from
this
court's
decision
in
timmreck
that
in
some
cases
there
might
be
a
question
as
to
whether
defendant
would
have
wanted
to
or
would
otherwise
have
been
able
to
appeal.
there
are
the
situations
where
a
defendant
has
waived
appeal
by
way
of
a
valid
plea
agreement.
there
are
situations,
as
this
case
was,
where
a
defendant
might
not
have
known
that
he
had
a
right
to
appeal,
but
might
have,
for
reasons
that
a
district
court
would
find
later,
be
unable
to
establish
that
he
would
have
wanted
to
appeal
or
have
had
any
reason
to
appeal.
so,
those
are...
subject
to
those
caveats--
mr.
roy
w.
mcleese
--the
way
those
cases
typically
played
out
and
the
way
they
would
continue
to
play
out
with
respect
to...
the
way
they
typically
played
out
was
for
a
defendant
to
raise
the
claim
in
the
form
of
an
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel
claim
where
the
defendant
would
say...
wouldn't
be
able
to
rely
on
rule
32,
but
would
say,
i
was
convicted.
my
attorney
was
there
with
me.
my
attorney...
either
i
requested
that
he
note
an
appeal
for
me
and
he
incompetently
failed
to
note
the
appeal.
i
was
thereby
completely
deprived
of
my
opportunity
to
appeal.
and
when
those
predicates
were
established,
the
courts
of
appeals
would
grant
relief--
mr.
roy
w.
mcleese
--i
think
this
case
is
distinguishable
from
rodriquez.
what
the...
if
rodriquez
had
supported
the
idea
that
it
was
appropriate
to
impose
a
rule
of
per
se
collateral
relief,
the
court's
opinion
would
have
been
quite
different.
the
court
would
have
said,
we
note
that
there
was
a
violation
of
rule
32
here.
that
entitles
the
defendant
to
relief
without
more,
and
we
therefore
direct--
mr.
roy
w.
mcleese
--i
think
the
debate
between
the
majority
and
justice
harlan
in
rodriquez
was
not
about
whether
there
should
be
an
inquiry
into
prejudice.
it
was
about
whether
the
majority
had
properly
conducted
what
everyone
agreed
needed
to
take
place,
which
was
an
inquiry
into
prejudice.
what
the
majority
in
rodriquez
said
was,
this
defendant...
they
did
not
say
there
was
a
rule
32
violation
and
therefore
we
grant
the
defendant
relief.
mr.
roy
w.
mcleese
what
they
said
was,
he
has
been
effectively
denied
his
right
to
appeal.
mr.
roy
w.
mcleese
and
it
reached
that
conclusion
based
not
solely
on
the
rule
32
violation,
but
on
two
other
features
of
the
case
that
supported
a
conclusion
of
prejudice.
one
was
that
the
defendant
who
had
up
to
that
point
been
represented
by
an
attorney
had
his
attorney
withdraw
all
the
sentencing
proceeding,
and
therefore
there
was
no
attorney
around
to
give
the
advice
that
it's
undisputed
occurred
here.
and
second,
that
the
defendant
at
the
sentencing
proceeding
indicated
to
the
judge
that
he
wished
to
pursue
an
appeal
by,
the
court
held,
saying
he
wanted
to
proceed
further
in
forma
pauperis.
and
the
court
pointed
out
that
there
would
be
no
reason
to
make
that
request
unless
he
wished
to
appeal.
and
the
court
went
on
in
rodriquez
to
say
that
the...
the
district
court's
failure
to
properly
follow
up
on
the
defendant's
articulated
desire
to
appeal,
coupled
with
the
other
two
failings,
the
failure
to
comply
with
rule
32
and...
i
guess
it's
not
correctly
described
as
a
failing,
but
the
withdrawal
of
an
attorney
so
that
the
defendant
was
unrepresented,
combined
to
deprive
the
defendant
of
the
right
to
appeal.
and
that
case
is
completely
different
from
the
present
case
where
all
you
have
is
a
32
violation,
and
that
rule
32
violation
is,
without
dispute,
treated
as
playing
no
causal
role
in...
in
interfering
with
the
defendant's
ability
to
appeal
at
all
because
the
defendant
knew
he
had
a
right
to
appeal.
mr.
roy
w.
mcleese
rule
32
says
that
if
a
request
of
that
kind
is
made
by
the
defendant,
the
clerk
needs
to
enter
the
notice
of
appeal.
it
does
not
say
and
has
never
been
interpreted
to
say
that
that's
information
that
the
court,
the
district
court,
should
give
the
defendant
or
is
obliged
by
rule
to
give
the
defendant.
mr.
roy
w.
mcleese
my...
my
trial
practice
is
a
few
years
out
of
date,
but
i
never
heard
a
district
court
communicate
that
information,
and
my
understanding
is
that
it
is
not
communicated.
i've
never
seen
an
appellate
or
trial
decision
suggesting
that
the
rule
would
be
interpreted
that
way.
i
don't
think
defendant...
petitioner
is
arguing
that
it
should
be
interpreted
that
way.
with
respect
to
whether
the
defendant
knew
about
that,
the
record
is
silent.
i
will
say
that
the
defendant...
the
petitioner
has
never
alleged
that
he
was
prejudiced
in
that
way.
and
i
would
like
to
address
the
suggestion
that
it
is
critical
that
the
advice
come
from
the
district
court
judge.
in
some
of
the
remarks
about
that
today,
petitioner
has
i
think
suggested
the
possibility
that
he
himself
was
prejudiced
because
the
advice
came
through
his
attorney
rather
than
through
the
district
court
judge.
and
that
suggestion,
i
think,
is
not
supported
by
the
record,
and
it
is
not...
is
not
properly
presented
in
the
case.
the
defendant
has
never
alleged
that
although
he
was
aware
of
his
right
to
appeal,
the
fact
that
the
district
court
didn't
clear
that
up
with
him
somehow
made
his
knowledge
less
reliable
or
deterred
him
from...
from
seeking
an
appeal.
that's
an
allegation
that's
never
been
in
the
case
and
is...
you
know,
is
not
a...
not
supported
by
the
record--
mr.
roy
w.
mcleese
--and
i
don't
think
that
was
the
principal
purpose
of
the
rule.
i
think
the
principal
purpose
of
the
rule
was
simply
to
make
sure
that
on
the
record
that
advice
was
given.
the
hope
is
that
counsel
will
have
done
it
too.
but
it
might
well
be
possible,
although
i
think
it
would
be
difficult
for
a
defendant,
to
make
a
record
saying,
the
judge
didn't
comply
with
rule
32.
my
attorney
talked
to
me
about
an
appeal,
but
for
various
reasons
i
was
afraid
to
pursue
one,
and
had
the
judge
advised
me,
things
would
have
been
different
and
i
would
have.
that's
a
kind
of
a
claim
that
perhaps
could
succeed.
my
point
is
more
that
that's...
the
record
doesn't
support
that...
that
claim
here--
mr.
roy
w.
mcleese
--and
all
of
that
is
true
in
the
rule
11
context
that
the
court
addressed
in
timmreck
where
there
later
on
may
well
need
to
be
collateral
litigation--
mr.
roy
w.
mcleese
--in
which
the
defense
attorney
is
going
to
be
testifying
about
his
recollection
about
what
he
told
the
defendant
about
the
nature
of
the
charges
or
the
possible
sentence.
and
i
don't
think
there
is
any
way
that
the
court
could
adopt
a
rule
of
per
se
collateral
relief
here
without
carrying
over
into
a
context
that
i
think
is
essentially
indistinguishable.
mr.
roy
w.
mcleese
i
think
there
is
a
difference
of
degree,
but
this
court's
application
of
the
fundamental
defect
of
miscarriage
of
justice
standard
has
never
been
calibrated
in
that
way.
in
addonizio,
for
example--
mr.
roy
w.
mcleese
--i...
i
think
that
the...
the
weight
of
authority
is
not
as
disproportionate
as
petitioner
would
suggest,
but
i
think
the
principal
explanation
for
that
is
that
the
case
law
in
this
area
evolved
before
much
of
this
court's
collateral
relief
jurisprudence,
and
it...
there
is
not
a
single
court
of
appeals
that
has
applied
a
rule
of
per
se
collateral
relief
when
it
considered
the
applicability
of
timmreck.
none
of
the
cases
that
apply
a
rule
of
per
se
collateral
relief
have
confronted
timmreck.
every
court
of
appeals
that
has
considered
timmreck
has
concluded
that
timmreck
forecloses
this
claim.
if
the
court
has
no
further
questions,
i
would
waive
the
rest
of
my
time.
