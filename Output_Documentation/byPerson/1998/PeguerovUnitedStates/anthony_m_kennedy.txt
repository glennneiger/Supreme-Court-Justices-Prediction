justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--i
suppose
the
inference
was
that
when
it
comes
from
the
judge,
this...
this
defendant
is
reluctant
to
antagonize
a
judge.
he's
going
to
move
to
modify
the
sentence,
to
reduce.
and
the
judge
said,
now...
now,
you
have
a
right
to
appeal,
and
maybe
ideally,
and
the
clerk
can
enter
the
notice
of
appeal.
it
just
has
a
different
weight
and
a
different
meaning.
i
think
that's
what
the
petitioner
is
telling
us.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
the
petitioner
manuel
peguero
entered
a
guilty
pleaded
conspiracy
to
distribute
cocaine
and
the
district
court
sentenced
him
to
the
lengthily
term
of
imprisonment.
the
court
did
not
advise
the
petitioner
at
the
sentencing
hearing
of
his
right
to
appeal
the
sentence
more
than
four
years
after
he
was
sentenced.
the
petitioner
moved
to
set
the
sentence
aside,
alleging
on
various
grounds.
for
our
purposes
the
important
allegation
he
made
was
that
the
trial
court
violated
federal
rule
of
criminal
procedure
32(a)(2)
by
failing
to
advise
petitioner
of
his
right
to
appeal
the
sentence.
after
an
evidentiary
hearing,
the
district
court
found
as
the
petitioner
himself
testified
that
the
petitioner
knew
of
his
right
to
appeal
when
the
sentencing
hearing
occurred.
the
district
court
rejected
the
petitioner's
claim
that
any
violation
of
rule
32
without
regards
to
prejudice
is
enough
to
vacate
a
sentence.
the
court
held
that
the
petitioner
was
not
entitled
to
habeas
relief
because
he
was
actually
aware
of
his
right
to
appeal
at
the
time
of
sentencing.
the
third
circuit
affirmed
and
we
agree
with
both
of
those
courts.
now,
we
hold
that
the
district
court's
failure
to
advise
the
defendant
of
his
right
to
appeal
does
not
entitle
him
to
habeas
relief,
if
he
knew
of
the
right
and
hence
suffered
no
prejudice
from
the
omission.
rule
32(a)(2)'s
requirement,
that
the
district
court
inform
a
defendant
of
his
right
to
appeal,
does
serve
important
and
vital
functions,
and
those
are
detailed
in
the
opinion,
and
it
is
undisputed
that
the
court's
failure
to
give
the
required
advise
at
the
sentencing
hearing
was
an
error.
a
violation
of
the
rule
does
not,
however
entitled
the
defendant
to
collateral
relief
in
all
circumstances.
as
a
general
rule,
the
court's
failure
to
give
a
defendant
advice
required
by
the
federal
rules
is
sufficient
basis
for
collateral
relief
only
when
the
defendant
is
prejudiced
by
the
error.
here
the
petitioner
had
full
knowledge
of
his
right
to
appeal.
hence
the
district
court's
violation
of
rule
32(a)(2)
by
failing
to
inform
him
of
that
right
did
not
prejudice
him.
the
fact
to
the
violation
standing
alone
does
not
entitle
the
petitioner
to
collateral
relief.
now,
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
third
circuit
is
affirmed.
justice
o'connor
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion
in
which
justices
stevens,
justice
ginsburg,
and
breyer
join.
