justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
why
do
we
have
to
go
beyond
the
fact
that
there
is
a...
there's
a
second
claim
here,
and
the
second
claim
was
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel
for
failure
to
take
the
appeal
that
the
defendant
requested
him
to
take.
so,
at
some
point
in
the
relevant
period,
on
the
defendant's
own
claim,
we
have
to
determine...
we
can
only
conclude
that
he
knew.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why
do
we
need
a
finding?
we've
got
this...
we've
got
the
defendant's
claim
of
ineffective
assistance,
which
is
predicated
on
the
fact
that
he
knew
he
had
a
right
of
appeal
and
told
his
lawyer
to
take
it
and
his
lawyer
didn't.
why
do
we
have
to
go
beyond
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
let's
leave
per
se
rules
aside
for
a
minute.
just
as
a
factual
matter
in
determining
what
facts
should
be
the
predicate
for
our
decision,
why
do
we
have
to
go
beyond
the...
the
second
claim
here
of
ineffective
assistance
in...
in
which
he...
in
which
the...
the
petitioner
himself
states
that
he...
he
knew
that
he
had
a
right
to
appeal.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
but
that's...
you're
answering
a
different
question.
the
question
before
us
now
is,
can...
can
we
make
the
assumption
that
he
in
fact
knew?
and
it
seems
to
me,
of
course,
we've
got
to
make
the
assumption
because
that
is
precisely
what
he
claimed
in
the
ineffective
assistance
claim.
isn't
that
correct?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
if
this
were
a...
an
omission
inconsistent
with
the
rudimentary
demands
of
fair
procedure,
well,
then
how
could
congress
cut
it
off
at
a
year?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
mean,
how
could
congress
limit
the
time
to
raise
it
if
it
were...
if
this
were
something...
if
the
omission
to
tell
him
about
this
were
inconsistent
with
the
rudimentary
demands
of
fair
procedure?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
how
could
congress
cut
it
off
at
a
year?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
no.
you
said
he
could
only
raise
it
in
a
year.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
so,
would
that
be
constitutional
if...
if
in
fact
this
is
a
right
that's
rudimentary
and
so
forth?
