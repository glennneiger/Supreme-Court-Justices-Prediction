justice
david
h.
souter
is...
is
it
true
that...
that
if
you
are
right,
the
same
thing
would
be
said
for
the
rule
11
warnings
in
the
plea
colloquy,
that...
that
failure
to
give
any
one
of
them
or
to
give
one
of
them
accurately
would
also
be
structural
error
with
the
same
result?
justice
david
h.
souter
why
do
we
need
to
know?
why
do
we
care?
what
we
do
know
is
that
he
understood
that
he
had
a
right
to
appeal.
what
more
do
we
need
to
know
than
that?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
he
didn't
raise
that
at
any
point,
did
he?
he's...
he's
raised
two
claims.
he
said
he
didn't
tell
me
about
the
appeal,
and
my
lawyer
was
ineffective
assistance.
that's
all...
ineffectively
assisting
me.
that's
the
only...
those
are
the
only
two
claims
he's
raised.
justice
david
h.
souter
sure.
justice
david
h.
souter
sure,
and...
and...
but
whether
he
could
have
done
that
or
not,
he
hasn't
done
it.
the
only
two
claims
we've
got
are...
are
the
claim
under
this
rule
and
the
ineffective
assistance
claim.
justice
david
h.
souter
is...
is
that
correct,
that...
that
the
only
two
claims
that
he's
raised
are
those?
justice
david
h.
souter
and
the
only
two
claims
that
were
ever
raised
were...
were
this
one
and
the
ineffective
assistance
claim.
is
that
correct?
justice
david
h.
souter
in
other
words,
he's
got
to
negate
the
possibility
of
harmless
error?
the
burden
is
on
him?
justice
david
h.
souter
now,
why...
why
is
the
burden
on
him
here,
whereas
the
burden,
i
take
it,
is
on
the
government
if
there's
a
rule
11
failure?
justice
david
h.
souter
is...
is
that
true
under
11(h)?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
it's
a
different
standard,
yes.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
that
has
been,
in
effect,
uniformly
accepted
as...
as
the...
the
basis
to
interpret
11(h)?
