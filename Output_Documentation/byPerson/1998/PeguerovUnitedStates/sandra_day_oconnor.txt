well,
mr.
siegel,
if
your
position
is
correct,
that
it
is
a
structural
error
if...
if
the
defendant
were
not
advised
by
the
judge
of
the
right
to
appeal
but
subsequently
perfected
an
appeal,
he'd
still
be
entitled
to
relief
under
your
theory
because
there's
been
a
structural
error
i
guess.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
that's
the
consequence
of
labeling
it
as
you
would
have
us
label
it.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
how
about...
is
there
ever
a
plea
agreement
in
which
a
defendant
agrees
to
give
up
any
right
to
appeal?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
suppose
that
were
the
case.
and
again,
if
it's
a
structural
error,
then
we
ignore
that
i
guess.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
siegel,
can
we
back
up
for
a
bit?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
mcleese,
what
if
rule
32
amendment
had
not
been
adopted
and
there
were
nothing
in
the
rule
telling
the
judge
that
he
had
to
inform
the
defendant
of
his
right
to
appeal?
and
let's
assume
further
that
the
defendant
did
not,
in
fact,
inform
the
defendant
of
his
right
to
appeal
at
sentencing.
what...
what
were
the
holdings
of
the
courts
before
the
adoption
of
these
amendments
to
rule
32?
