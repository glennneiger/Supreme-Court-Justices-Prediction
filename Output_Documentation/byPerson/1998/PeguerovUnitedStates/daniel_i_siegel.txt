mr.
daniel
i.
siegel
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
there
are
three
reasons
why
the
failure
to
warn
of
appellate
rights
is
a
structural
error
which
justifies
relief
as
a
matter
of
law.
first,
there
is
no
substitute
for
a
warning
that
comes
directly
from
the
judge.
second,
there
is
no
way
to
correct
the
error
on
direct
appeal.
and
third,
a
judicial
warning
has
been
deemed
necessary
both
by
this
court
and
by
the
congress.
turning
to
the
first
point,
there
is
no
substitute
for
a--
mr.
daniel
i.
siegel
--this
court
has
never
dealt
with
a
structural
error
regarding
access
to
an
appeal.
all
the
structural
errors
discussed
by
this
court
have
been
trial
errors.
but
i'd
like
to
analogize
this
case
to
a
structural
error
to
explain
why,
using
the
terms
of
hill,
the
failure
to
warn
by
a
judge
is
a
rudimentary
demand
of
fair
procedure.
why
is
it
there's
no
substitute
for
a
warning
that
comes
directly
from
the
judge?
because
rule
32
anticipates
that
when
the
defendant
hears
the
warning
that
comes
from
the
judge,
he
may
at
that
moment
on
the
record
state
at
the
sentencing
hearing,
yes,
i
want
an
appeal.
and,
indeed,
the
rule
takes
account
of
that
possibility
because
the
clerk
is
empowered
to
immediately
file
a
notice
of
appeal
on
behalf
of
the
defendant
who
spontaneously
requests
a
notice
of
appeal
after
being
warned
by
the
district
court
judge.
for
that
mechanism
to
work,
the
warning
has
to
come
from
the
district
court
judge,
and
the
failure
to
follow
the
rule
we
submit
should,
therefore,
be
akin
to
a
structural
error
which
is
remedied
as
a
matter
of
law.
mr.
daniel
i.
siegel
no,
for
a
very
important
reason.
when
a
defendant
doesn't
get
his
full
rule
11
warnings,
his
attorney,
assuming
that
there's
a
warning
of
the
right
to
appeal
and
it's
properly
preserved...
his
attorney
can
raise
those
errors
on
direct
appeal
in
the
court
of
appeals.
you
can
do
that
with
virtually
any
error
under
the
rules
of
criminal
procedure
except
this
rule
because
if
a
defendant
doesn't
get
the
warning
from
the
judge
of
his
right
to
a
direct
appeal,
that
may
effectively
block
the
defendant's
access
to
a
direct
appeal.
and
that
kind
of
an
issue
is
a
structural
error
which
we
submit
should
be--
mr.
daniel
i.
siegel
--we
know
from
the
record
as
a
finding
of
fact
from
the
district
court
judge,
and
the
defense
attorney
testified
that
he
discussed
the
appellate
rights
with
the
defendant
and
that
the
defendant
agreed
not
to
go
on
with
an
appeal
and
to,
instead,
cooperate.
but
we
will
never
know,
despite
that
warning,
what
would
have
happened
if
the
judge
had
then
warned
the
defendant
of
his
appellate
rights.
it's
very
possible--
mr.
daniel
i.
siegel
--we
have
no
indication
from
the
record
what
his
response
would
have
been
if
the
judge
had
told
him.
for
example,
i
can
tell
you
from
experience
that
the
sentencing
hearing
is
often
the
low
point
in
the
attorney/client
relationship,
and
sometimes
defendants
do
not
trust
their
attorneys,
especially
if
it
is
an
appointed
attorney.
sometimes
a
defendant
can
be
confused
and
have
in
his
mind
the
thought,
oh,
i'm
going
to
get
in
trouble
if
i
file
an
appeal
or
my
cooperation
won't
work
out
if
i
file
an
appeal.
but
if
the
defendant
hears
it
from
the
district
court
judge
on
the
record
at
the
sentencing
hearing,
first
he
knows
it's
legitimate.
second,
the
district
court
judge
tells
him
under
the
rule,
mr.
defendant,
you
have
a
right
to
proceed
in
forma
pauperis,
to
have
a
free
appeal.
the
structure
of
the
rule
then
anticipates
that
in
response
to
what
the
judge
says,
the
defendant
may
make
a
spontaneous
statement
on
the
record
saying,
yes,
please
file
the
appeal,
and
it
happens
immediately.
now,
that's
a
little
different...
a
lot
different
than
the
rest
of
the
structure
of
the
rules
of
criminal
procedure.
mr.
daniel
i.
siegel
well,
i
would
say
that
in
that
case
there--
mr.
daniel
i.
siegel
--there
would
be
no...
the
rule
wouldn't
apply
where
the
defendant
had
actually
filed
his
appeal.
i
think
this
rule,
fairly
read,
is
a
way
to
make
sure
the
defendant
gets
his
appeal,
and
if
gets
his
appeal,
there's...
there's
no
reason
to
apply
the
rule.
the
same
for
the
exception--
mr.
daniel
i.
siegel
--yes,
your
honor,
and--
mr.
daniel
i.
siegel
--well,
no.
in...
in
the
case
of
a
defendant
who
pleads
guilty,
pursuant
to
a
plea
agreement,
and
then
waives
his
right
to
appeal,
there's
a
colloquy
on
the
record
at
the
guilty
plea
hearing
where
the
judge
has
to
explain
to
the
defendant
what
he's
giving
up
in
his
rights.
if
there's
a
knowing
and
voluntary
waiver,
you
can
always
make
a
knowing
and
voluntary
waiver
on
the
record
of...
of
a
procedural
right,
or
any
right
indeed.
but
it
is
different
where
there
is
no
appeal
filed
and
there
is
no
plea
agreement
waiving
the
right
to
appeal.
now,
the
third
circuit
has
recognized
another
exception
which
is
that
if
the
defendant
gets
the
warning
at
the
guilty
plea
hearing
a
few
weeks
earlier,
then
that's
enough
to
meet
the
rule.
mr.
daniel
i.
siegel
well,
i
would
have
to
disagree
with
that,
going
back
to
the
fundamental
point
that
you
never
know
what
the
defendant
would
have
said
if
he
had
been
told
by
the
judge.
now,
if
there
was
a
colloquy
between
the
defendant
and
the
judge
giving
up
his
appeal
rights,
then
you
know.
if
the
appeal
was
filed,
then
it's
clear
than
the
rule
is
not
applicable.
mr.
daniel
i.
siegel
well,
your
honor,
we
don't
dispute
the
general
applicability
of
the
harmless
error
rule
or
that
there
are
no
broad
exceptions
to
it.
but
this
rule
is
so
unique
and
unusual--
mr.
daniel
i.
siegel
--the--
mr.
daniel
i.
siegel
--well,
in
this
case,
your
honor,
we
submit
that
the
structure
of
the
rule
shows
that
it
is
likely
because
this
is
a
rule
where
the
people
who
put
together
the
rule,
which
was
approved
by
this
court,
specifically
created
a
structure
where
the
defendant
could
spontaneously
request
it
on
the
record.
mr.
daniel
i.
siegel
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
daniel
i.
siegel
because
the
right
to
appeal
is
so
important
and
because
you
can
never
really
know
what
would
have
happened
if
the
structure
or
the
rule
had
been
followed,
i
would
say,
yes,
in
this
unusual
circumstance,
just--
mr.
daniel
i.
siegel
--yes.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
daniel
i.
siegel
the
district
court
made
the
finding
in...
favor
of
the
government,
that
the
defendant
was
warned
of
his
right
to
appeal.
mr.
daniel
i.
siegel
that
was
by
crediting
the
attorney.
now,
the
attorney
didn't
have
a
letter
to
the
defendant.
he
didn't
have
a
memorandum
to
his
file.
he
didn't
have
a
notation
on
the
file.
he
was
testifying
solely
from
memory.
so,
it
is--
mr.
daniel
i.
siegel
--well,
the
district
court
made
a
factual
finding
that
there
was
a
discussion
between
the
defendant
and
his
attorney--
mr.
daniel
i.
siegel
--the
whole
purpose
of
a
per
se
rule
which
has
been
adopted--
mr.
daniel
i.
siegel
--because
no
matter
what
was
stated
by
the
petitioner,
there
is
always
the
possibility
that
if
the
defendant
had
been
properly
warned
by
the
judge,
as
contemplated
by
the
rule,
that
he
would
have--
mr.
daniel
i.
siegel
--it
is
a
fact
established
for
the
record,
your
honor,
yes.
mr.
daniel
i.
siegel
yes.
the--
mr.
daniel
i.
siegel
--well,
there's
no
question
about
the
4-year
delay,
but
under
cases
that
will
be
arising
under
the
current
law,
there
is
now
a
1-year
limitations
period
under
the
aedpa,
anti-terrorism
and
effective
death
penalty
act.
so,
the
practical
effect
of
the
court's
ruling
today
is
going
to
be
this.
if
a
judge,
say,
here
in
the
district
of
columbia
federal
district
court
goes
through
a
sentencing
hearing
and
neglects
to
inform
the
defendant
of
his
appellate
rights,
and
4
or
5
months
later,
the
defendant
is
taken
to
another
state
and
placed
in
a
penitentiary
and
meets
a
jailhouse
lawyer
who
says,
hey,
you...
you
had
a
right
to
an
appeal,
you
had
a
right
to
be
informed,
when
the
defendant
files
that
motion
within
the
1-year
period,
the
outcome
of
this
case
is
going
to
decide
whether
the
judge
can
do
one
of
two
things.
on
one
hand,
you
can
do
what
happened
in
the
gaeta
case
in
massachusetts,
judge
tauro's
rule,
which
is
simply
say,
well,
i've
reviewed
the
transcript
of
the
sentencing
hearing,
i
see
there
was
an
error
here.
we're
going
to
reinstate
the
sentence,
and
we're
going
to
reinstate
the
appellate
rights
and
have
the
clerk
file
a
pro
se
notice
of
appeal
on
behalf
of
the
defendant.
if
you
adopt
the
government's
position
that
the
timmreck
and
hill
standards
requires
proof
of
prejudice
in
this
particular
instance,
then
the
judge
has
got
to
ask
the
marshall
to
bring
the
defendant
back
from
the
prison.
you
have
to
appoint
a
new
attorney
because
there's
going
to
be
testimony
regarding
whether
or
not
he
was
discussing
it
with
counsel.
you've
got
to
have
an
evidentiary
hearing.
the
district
court
has
to
make
findings
of
fact
and
conclusions
of
law.
it
seems
to
me
that
judicial
efficiency
in
the
interests
of
the
federal
courts
cut
in
favor
of
a
rule
which,
within
that
1-year
period,
gives
the
district
court
discretion
to
simply
correct
the
error
in
an
expeditious
manner.
mr.
daniel
i.
siegel
that
is
correct.
the
error
was
the
district
court's
failure
to
comply
with
then
existing
rule
32(a)(2).
mr.
daniel
i.
siegel
the
object
of
it
would
be
to
get
a
new
appeal.
the
sentencing
was
always
considered
necessary--
mr.
daniel
i.
siegel
--it's
an
appeal
from
the
judgment,
both
the
sentence
and
the
judgment
of
conviction.
mr.
daniel
i.
siegel
that
is
true,
your
honor.
but
the
question
of
a
voluntarily
and
knowing
guilty
plea
is
always
one
that
could
be
raised
on
a
direct
appeal.
mr.
daniel
i.
siegel
i
think
that
mr.
peguero
has
a
good
direct
appeal
claim
regarding
the
conduct
of
the
guilty
plea
colloquy
under
rule
11.
mr.
daniel
i.
siegel
that's
true,
but
on
direct
appeal,
the
defendant
will
always
have
an
opportunity
to
argue
in
the
court
of
appeals,
one,
that
the
guilty
plea
was
not
knowingly
and
voluntarily
entered
or,
number
two,
that
there
was
a
violation
of
rule
11.
mr.
daniel
i.
siegel
now--
mr.
daniel
i.
siegel
--to
respond
to
your
question,
there's
one
point
where
i
agree
with
the
government.
mr.
daniel
i.
siegel
the
only
claim
that
is
active
now
in
the
2255
petition
is
the
failure
of
the
judge
to
inform
the
defendant
of
his
appellate
rights.
mr.
daniel
i.
siegel
yes,
in
the
2255
petition.
on
this
point,
however,
i'd
point
out
an
agreement
with
the
government
at
page
25
of
their
brief
where
they
point
out
that
proving
a
meritorious
issue
on
appeal
is
not
a
prerequisite
to
getting
the
appeal
back.
certainly
we're
going
to
review
the
record
to
see
if
there
are
any
sentencing
issues
that
we
can
raise
in
the
court
of
appeal
under
the
clear...
under
the
clearly
erroneous
standard.
but
that's
how
i
see
the
appeal
at
this
point.
mr.
daniel
i.
siegel
excuse
me?
mr.
daniel
i.
siegel
i
understand
the
question.
mr.
daniel
i.
siegel
the
congress
is
not
cutting
off
the
defendant's
right
to
raise
it,
but
it
is
regulating
the
way
in
which
the
defendant--
mr.
daniel
i.
siegel
--that
is
correct.
mr.
daniel
i.
siegel
it...
it
is
a
little
beyond.
i
would...
i
would
argue,
however,
that
the
congress
in
regulating
these
matters
always
has
the
right
to
put
some
reasonable
time
limits
on.
indeed,
the
current
rules
for
post-conviction
petitions
contain
an
objection
that
can
be
made
by
the
government
if
they
think
the
petition
has
been
delayed
a
long
time
and
they're
prejudiced
in
responding
to
it
under
the
rules
for
2255
petitions.
they
can
say,
dismiss
this
petition
because
we
can't
respond
to
it
because
it's
come
too
late.
so,
even
under
the
preexisting
law,
it
was
possible
to
make
an
argument
based
upon
essentially
a
laches
argument.
the
third
point
i...
i
wanted
to
make
to
the
court
is
that
a
warning
from
the
judge,
the
district
court
judge,
has
been
deemed
necessary
not
only
by
this
court
through
its
rules,
but
by
the
congress.
in
1984
congress
passed
the
sentencing
reform
act,
and
congress
specifically
required
judges
to
warn
defendants
that
they
had
a
right
to
appeal
from
the
sentence.
so--
mr.
daniel
i.
siegel
--that
is
correct.
they
didn't
discuss
that.
however,
i
would
point
out
that
in
984
when
they
passed
the
act,
all
of
the
case
law
on
this
subject,
without
exception,
supported
the
per
se
rule.
so,
to
just
summarize
again
on
the
three
points
that
we
had
raised,
we
submit,
first,
that
there
is
no
substitute
for
a
warning--
mr.
daniel
i.
siegel
--in
1984,
when
they
passed
the
sentencing
guidelines,
they
by
statute
amended
rule
32(a)
to
insert
a
requirement
that
the
district
court
judge
must
also
inform
the
defendant
that
he
has
a
right
to
appeal
from
the
sentence
because
prior
to
19--
mr.
daniel
i.
siegel
--well,
the
question
was...
your
honor
has
posed
to
me
a
question
and
says--
mr.
daniel
i.
siegel
--well,
the
statute
doesn't
say
anything
about
a
per
se
rule.
so...
so,
maybe
we
should
assume
that
they
didn't
intend--
mr.
daniel
i.
siegel
--okay.
they
didn't
say
anything
about
a
per
se
remedy.
mr.
daniel
i.
siegel
however,
if
you
want
to
try
to
find
some
indication
of
what
congress
might
have
been
thinking,
if
you're
inclined
to
look
for
the...
the
background
of
what
was
in
the
law
at
that
time,
in
1984,
you'll
see
that
all
of
the
appellate
court
cases
dealing
with
this
issue
before
1984
adopted
the
per
se
rule--
mr.
daniel
i.
siegel
--they
added
to
the
rule
to
require
not
only
a...
an
advising
of
the
defendant
after
trial
of
his
right
to
appeal
from
the
conviction,
but
also
requiring
now
under
the
guidelines
that
defendants
be
specifically
told
that
they
had
the
right
to
appeal
from
the
sentence.
justice
scalia,
i
think
you
had
a
question.
mr.
daniel
i.
siegel
these
are...
these
are
cases
arising
after
the
1966
amendment
to
the
guideline
which
first
said
in
all
cases
where
the
defendant
has
gone
to
trial,
the
district
court
judge
must
warn
the
defendant
on
the
record
that
he
has
a
right
to
an
appeal.
mr.
daniel
i.
siegel
these
cases...
this
is
nothing
new,
which
is
what
has...
what
has
happened
in
this
case.
these
cases
came
up
under
the
old
rule
before
the
sentencing
guidelines
also,
and
the
consistent
ruling
of
the
courts
of
appeal,
even
after
timmreck,
by
the
way--
mr.
daniel
i.
siegel
--yes.
mr.
daniel
i.
siegel
some
were
before
but
some
were
after.
but
all
of
them
prior
to
1984
held
that
where
the
district
court
fails
to
inform
the
defendant
that
he
has
a
right
to
appeal,
the
automatic
remedy
simply
to
reinstate
his
appellate
rights.
mr.
daniel
i.
siegel
some
of
those
cases
indicate
the
defendant
did,
yes.
yes.
are
there
any...
if
there
are
no
other
questions,
i
will
sum
up.
to
summarize
on
this
point,
your
honor,
we
again
submit
that
a
failure
to
advise
a
defendant
of
his
appellate
rights
coming
from
the
district
court
judge
is
akin
to
a
structural
error
which
should
be
remedied
as
a
matter
of
law.
we
submit
that
there
is
no
substitute
for
a
warning
that
comes
directly
from
the
judge.
we
submit
that
there
is
no
way
to
correct
it
on
direct
appeal,
and
we
submit
that
it
has
been
deemed
necessary
both
by
this
court
and
by
this
congress.
so,
we
would
ask
this
court,
consistent
with
the
majority
opinion
of
justices...
judges
who
have
considered
it
in
the
court
of
appeals,
to
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
and
to
reinstate
defendant's
right
to
take
a
direct
appeal.
thank
you.
mr.
daniel
i.
siegel
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
daniel
i.
siegel
thank
you.
i
would
briefly
like
to
respond
to
some
comments
and
questions,
first
a
comment
and
question
made
by
justice
ginsburg
regarding
the
amount
of
time
that
a
defendant
has
to
make
up
any
error
in
meeting
the
10-day
limit.
the
government
suggested
that
if
the
defendant
doesn't
meet
the
10-day
limit,
that
it
can
be
corrected
if
he
acts
promptly.
the
defense
counsel
can
ask
the
court
to
file
a
late
notice
of
appeal
if
he
shows
good
cause
for
doing
it,
but
that's
only
a
30-day
window
of
opportunity.
and
what
happens
as
a
practical
matter
is
that
the
defendant
gets
moved
quickly
by
the
united
states
marshall.
sometimes
defense
counsel
doesn't
get
to
him.
the
defendant
could
be
moved
across
state
lines
to
a
federal
penitentiary
or
can
be
in
transit
to
a
federal
penitentiary
and
not
be
able
to
get
in
touch
with
him.
so,
that
30-day
limit
at
the...
at
the
maximum...
and
it's
a
10-day
limit
with
the
30
days
for
good
cause...
is
a
very
short
limit.
and
i
suggest
to
you
that
that
might
be
one
of
the
reasons
why
that
the
courts
of
appeals
are
adopting
this
per
se
rule
even
after
the
timmreck
case.
in
fact,
in
the
sanchez
decision--
mr.
daniel
i.
siegel
--it
is
true.
none
of
the
courts
that
have
spoken
about
the
per
se
rule
discussed
timmreck.
now,
sanchez,
judge
buckley's
decision
for
the
district
of
columbia
circuit,
discussed
the
tress
opinion
from
the
seventh
circuit
which
adopted
their
view
of
the
timmreck
standard.
so,
you
could
say
that
they
took
account
of
it,
but
that
court
still
stood
by
the...
the
per
se
rule.
and
i
think...
i
think
it
shows
something
about
the
severity
of
the
problem.
we
were
able
to
find
31
cases
since
1989
on
westlaw
where
a
defendant
had
not
been
warned
of
his
appellate
rights
and
it
was
necessary
to
use
a
2255
proceeding
to
get
his
direct
appeal
right
back.
i
submit
to
you
that
that
probably
represents
the
tip
of
iceberg
because
normally
the
way
you
would
expect
a
case
like
this
to
be
resolved
is
that
it
comes
down
to
the
district
court
judge,
he
or
she
takes
a
look
at
the
record
and
says,
oh,
we...
we
made
a
mistake
at
the
sentencing
hearing.
let's
reinstate
the
defendant's
appellate
rights.
and
now
that
there
is
a
1-year
limitation
on
bringing
this
sort
of
petition,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
interests
of...
of
the
courts,
in
addition
to
the
defendants,
in
a
fair
rule
is...
is
served
by
recognizing
this
is
as
an
unusual
structural
type
of
error.
the...
there
was
a
question,
i
believe
from
justice
ginsburg,
regarding
the
warning
about
the
clerk
being
able
to
file
a
notice
of
appeal.
under
the
rule,
the
district
court
judge
is
under
absolutely
no
obligation
to
tell
a
defendant
that
the
clerk
can
immediately
file
a
notice
of
appeal
on
his
behalf.
the
way
the
rule
is
written
it
says
that
on
the
request
of
a
defendant,
the
clerk
can
immediately
file
a
notice
of
appeal
on
defendant's
behalf.
what
that
suggests
to
me
is
that
the
drafters
of
the
rule
anticipated
that
in
response
to
warning
from
the
judge,
the
defendant
might
spontaneously
on
the
of
the
sentencing
hearing
ask
for
the
reinstitution...
ask
for
his
direct
appeal.
and
that,
it
seems
to
me,
is
a
structural
error
that...
that
should
be
remedied
as
a
matter
of
law.
turning
to
the
final
point,
there
were
questions--
mr.
daniel
i.
siegel
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
daniel
i.
siegel
i
haven't...
i
don't
know
whether
judges
tend
to
be
sensitive
when
i'm
around,
but
i
doubt
it.
but
i've
never
seen
this
happen
in
a
case
where
i
was
doing
a
sentencing
hearing.
we
have
a
few
cases
in
our
office
where
we've
had
this
problem.
so,
i
would
submit
you
that
it
is
something
that
recurs.
did
i
answer
your
question
fully?
mr.
daniel
i.
siegel
okay.
the...
the
final
point
i
wanted
to
make
was
reference
to
the
rodriquez
case.
and
rodriquez
does
have
a
different
factual
situation,
and
it
is
not
on
point
for
this
case
because
of
the
additional
facts
that
were
involved.
but
i...
i'd
like
to
read
to
you
just
a
couple
of
quotes
from
this
court's
opinion
at
395
united
states
reports
331
and
332
where
the
court
observed
first,
it
appears
from
the
trial
transcript
in
this
case
that
the
trial
judge
erroneously
failed
to
advise
petitioner
of
his
right
to
appeal.
then
the
court
went
on
to
make
an
argument,
which
is
very
similar
to
the
argument
i've
made
today.
had
he
known
that
the
clerk
would
file
a
notice
of
appeal
for
him,
he
could
easily
have
avoided
the
difficulties
he
has
faced.
at
the
very
least,
the
trial
judge
should
have
inquired
into
the
circumstances
surrounding
the
attempt
to
make
the
in
forma
pauperis
motion.
his
failure...
and
we're
talking
about
the
district
judge's
failure.
his
failure
to
do
so
effectively
deprived
petitioner
of
his
right
to
appeal.
and
so
i
would
submit
that
the
rule,
which
recognizes
the
value
of
direct
appeal,
is
a
rule
which
would
most...
go
furthest
in
honoring
the
defendant's
right
to
choose
that
appeal
under
all
circumstances.
given
the
new
limitation
of
1
year,
i
would
state
that
this
rule
creates
an
unusual
structural
error
which
should
justify
relief
as
a
matter
of
law.
if
there
are
no
further
questions.
