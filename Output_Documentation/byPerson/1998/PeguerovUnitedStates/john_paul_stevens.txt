but
the
one
flaw
in
this...
i'm
just...
think
it
through
with
you
a
minute.
congress
did
not
provide,
however,
that
the
failure
to
give
the
warning
shall
automatically
result
in
the
reinstatement
of
the
appeal
right,
which
presumably
they
could
have
done
that.
justice
john
paul
stevens
refresh
my
recollection.
exactly
what
did
they
do
in
1984?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but...
but
then
what
was
the
preexisting
law
that
they
presumably
adopted
if
they
first
put
it
in
in
1984?
i--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
doesn't
say
anything
about
a
per
se
remedy.
it
has
a
per
se
rule.
justice
john
paul
stevens
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
that's
what
i
was
going
to
ask.
those
are
after
timmreck.
justice
john
paul
stevens
timmreck
would
have
changed
it
as
to
the
colloquy
at
the
rule
11
stage.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
mcleese,
i
don't
think
that's
right.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
rodriquez
case
came
before
the
real
development
of
the
challenge
to
the
competency
of
counsel,
and
in
the
rodriquez
case,
they
did
allow
the
reinstatement
of
the
appeal,
notwithstanding
the
fact
that
there
had
been
a
lawyer
there.
and
i'm
not
sure.
the
problem
i
have
with
your
position
is
do
you
think
the
rodriquez
case
was,
in
effect,
overruled
by
timmreck,
or
do
you
think
this
case
is
distinguishable
from
rodriquez?
justice
john
paul
stevens
except
for
the
fact
justice
harlan
said
that
there
should
be
an
inquiry
into
prejudice,
and
the
court
did
not
do
that.
it
sent
it
back
automatically
to
reinstate
the
appeal.
justice
john
paul
stevens
they
said--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--correct.
justice
john
paul
stevens
of
course,
mr.
mcleese--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--no.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
in
the
facts
of
this
case,
you're
dead
right.
i
mean,
the
equities
are
all
with
the
government
in
this
case,
but
we're
trying
to
decide
what
should
be
the
rule
in
the
generality
of
cases.
and
i
think
it
is
true
that
at
that
particular
time
in
the
proceeding,
there
is
a
greater
likelihood
of
a
lawyer
making
this
particular
error
than
is
true
of
most
situations
where
a
lawyer
may
fail
to
give
advice
because
of
the
emotional
situation
at
that
particular
point
in
the
proceeding.
and
the
lawyer
is
going
to...
always
it
seems
to
me,
when
asked
later,
he's
assumed
he
followed
a
standard
practice.
so,
i
think
in
all
truthfulness,
the
normal
lawyer
in
the
normal
case
would
say,
oh,
i'm
sure
i
gave
him
that
advice.
i
always
do.
but
there's
always
the
possibility
of
error.
justice
john
paul
stevens
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
except
there
is
this
one
difference,
that
in
the
rule
11
context,
you
set
aside
a
guilty
plea,
which
means
you
then
open
the
matter
up
for
trial.
here
what
you
do
is
you
reinstate
a
right
to
appeal
from
a
guilty
plea,
which
is
a
pretty
long
shot
anyway.
so,
your
chances
that
the
defendant
will
actually
walk
are
quite
remote
in
this
context,
whereas
they're
more
likely
in
the
other
situation.
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
odd
thing
about
it
is
the
courts
of
appeals
so
uniformly
come
out...
not
uniform,
but
most
of
them
seem
to
come
out
the
other
way,
which
is
puzzling
given
the...
the
clarity
of
the
timmreck
opinion.
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
agree
with
your
opponent
that
none
of
the
courts
that
adopted
it
distinguished
timmreck
or
discussed
timmreck?
