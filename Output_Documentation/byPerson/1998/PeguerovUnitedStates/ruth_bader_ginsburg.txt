justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
is
it
clear
that
defendant
knew?
i
mean,
the
lawyer
testified
that
the
lawyer
told
him.
did
defendant,
who
also
testified,
say,
yes,
he
knew?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that
was
by
crediting
the
attorney.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
if
you...
you
have
already
recognized
that
there
would
be
some
exceptions.
even
if
you're
right
about
this
being
a
structural
whatever,
why
not
say,
but
it
took
him
4
years
to
bring
this
forward,
so
at
least
we're
going
to
limit
this
automatic
operation
to
the
diligent
defendant,
not
someone
who
waits
4
years
to
say,
oh,
i
should
have
been
told
i
had
a
right
to
a
lawyer?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what...
what
was
the
alleged
error
here?
i
thought
that
the
sentence
was
within
the
guidelines
for
the
offense
to
which
defendant
pled.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes,
but...
but
the
object
of
it
would
be
to
get
a
new
sentencing
and
a--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--it's
an
appeal
from
the
sentence.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
thought
he
entered
a
guilty
plea.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so...
so,
are
we
just
discussing
this
in
the
abstract,
or
did
this
defendant
have
something
appealable?
and
if
so,
what?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
how
would
that
work
of
showing
prejudice
where
the
defendant
makes
a
credible
case
that
he
didn't
find
out
that
he
had
a
right
to
appeal
until
after...
how
many
days
does
he
have?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
10
days?
he
didn't
find
out
until
it
was
too
late,
till
day
15.
suppose
that's
the
fact.
would
it
make
any
difference?
and
we're...
we're
assuming
the
defendant
knew
and
that
that's
a
significant
factor.
but
is
it?
would
your
position
be
any
different
if
defendant...
if
the
judge
says,
yes,
i
believe
the
defendant
when
he
says
he
didn't
know
till
day
15.
what
would
then
happen?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
no.
i
mean
on
a
2255.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
he
would
be
and
he
wouldn't
have
to
show
that
he
had
a
probable
chance
of
prevailing
on
the
appeal.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so,
this
case
would
have
come
out
the
other
way
appropriately
in
your
view
if
the
defendant
in
fact
did
not
know
within
the
10
days
that
he
had
a
right
to
appeal.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
did
he
know
he
had
the
right
to
have
the
clerk
file
the
notice
for
him?
because
that's...
doesn't
rule
32
say
two
things?
one,
the
judge
should
tell
the
defendant
you
have
a
right
to
appeal
from
the
sentence,
and
two,
if
you
want,
the
clerk
will
file
the
notice
for
you.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
do
you
know
what
the
practice
is
for
district
judges
when
they
warn
the
defendant
about
the
appeal
rights,
say,
and
they
want
the
clerk
to
file
the
notice?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
may
i
ask,
before
you
do
that--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--about
the...
the
practice
that...
that
you
have
experienced.
this
is
something
basic
that
judges
would
have
no
reason
not
to
tell
a
defendant.
does
the
u.s.
attorney
ever
prompt
a
judge
when
he
forgets?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes.
