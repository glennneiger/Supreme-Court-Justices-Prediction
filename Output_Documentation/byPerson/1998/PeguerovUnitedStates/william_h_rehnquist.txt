97-9217,
manuel
dejesus
peguero
v.
united
states.
mr.
siegel.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you...
you
state
these
three
reasons.
i
think
fulminante
was
where
we
talked...
talked
about
structural
error
and
what
it
took.
those
don't...
the
reasons
you
cite
don't
come
out
of
that
opinion,
do
they?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
as
soon
as
you
start
getting
exceptions,
it
seems
to
me
you're
strongly
cutting
against
your
argument,
this
is
so-called
structural
error,
that
it's
much
like
any
other
kind
of
error
that
you
evaluate
for
harmlessness.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
i
thought
congress
changed
the
rule
in
1984.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
were
those...
were
those
cases
in
which
the
defendant
knew
of
his
right
by
advice
from
counsel?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
siegel.
mr.
mcleese,

hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
mcleese.
mr.
siegel,
do
you
have
something
further?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
have
5
minutes.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
siegel.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
97-9217,
peguero
versus
