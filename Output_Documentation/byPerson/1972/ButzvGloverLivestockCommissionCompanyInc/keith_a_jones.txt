mr.
keith
a.
jones
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
eight
circuit.
the
issue
presented
is
whether
the
court
below
exceeded
the
permissible
scope
of
review
in
setting
aside
the
secretary’s
20-day
suspension
of
respondent
as
a
registrant
under
the
packers
and
stockyards
act
of
1921.
the
suspension
was
ordered,
pursuant
to
the
secretary’s
authority
to
suspend
for
a
reasonable
period
any
registrant
committing
any
violation
of
the
act.
respondent
is
a
livestock
broker
for
a
market
agency,
who
is
paid
a
sales
commission
for
conducting
an
auction
of
which
livestock
is
sold
on
a
weight
basis.
respondent
has
now
been
detected
violating
the
act
on
four
separate
occasions
by
short-weighing
cattle
consigned
to
it
for
sale.
on
the
earlier
occasions,
it
had
simply
been
warned
against
future
violations.
on
the
fourth
instance
of
short-weighing,
which
is
the
subject
of
this
suit,
a
formal
complaint
against
respondent
was
issued
by
the
packers
and
stockyards
administration.
the
case
was
initially
tried
before
department
of
agriculture
hearing
examiner.
it
found
that
respondent
had
intentionally
short-weighed
the
cattle
consigned
to
it
for
sale.
the
hearing
examiner
recommended
an
appropriate
cease
and
desist
order
and
also
a
30-day
suspension.
the
matter
was
then
reviewed
by
a
judicial
officer
having
authority
to
act
on
behalf
of
the
secretary.
he
found
that
respondent
short-weighing
constituted
a
willful
violation
of
the
act
and
he
issued
the
cease
and
desist
order
recommended
by
the
hearing
examiner,
but
he
reduced
respondent’s
suspension
to
only
20
days.
since
the
respondent
operates
its
market
only
one
day
per
week,
this
20-day
suspension
will
affect
at
most
three
business
days.
before
discussing
the
disposition
of
this
case
on
appeal,
i
think
it
will
be
helpful
to
describe
the
respondent’s
brokerage
function
as
a
market
agency
and
to
explain
why
a
market
agency
like
the
respondent
might
intentionally
short-weigh
the
cattle
consigned
to
it
for
sale.
the
sellers
at
respondent’s
auctions
are
typically
livestock
producers,
who
bring
or
send
their
cattle
to
the
respondent
for
purposes
of
the
auction.
these
livestock
producers
rarely
know
the
true
weight
of
their
cattle.
they
typically
lack
the
weighing
facilities
necessary
to
determine
the
true
weight.
it
is
the
respondent
who
is
responsible
for
weighing
the
cattle.
the
buyers
at
the
auction
frequently,
perhaps
usually,
are
representatives
of
meatpacking
companies.
they
buy
the
cattle
at
the
weight
given
by
the
respondent
and
the
cattle
are
then
shipped
to
the
packing
plants
where
they
are
reweighed.
the
sad
truth
of
the
matter
is
that
the
packers
tend
to
patronize
the
auctions
held
by
market
agencies,
which
give
them
a
favorable
break
on
the
weight,
thus,
short-weighing
encourages
buyers.
and
this
in
turn
stimulates
an
increase
in
sales,
for
the
livestock
producers
will
tend
to
patronize
the
markets
which
attract
sufficient
buyers
to
ensure
a
sale
of
their
cattle,
and
since
the
market
agencies
are
paid
on
a
per
head
basis,
they
profit
from
this
higher
level
of
sales.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
it's
based
--
and
i
think
that
in
the
record
there
is
a
schedule
of
the
commission,
that
is
based
in
part
on
the
weight
of
the
cattle.
if
the
cattle
in
question
weighs
400
pounds
or
more,
i
think
the
sales
commission
is
$4
and
some
odd
cents.
if
it
is
between
300
and
399
pounds,
it
is
a
lower
figure,
and
so
forth.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
only
if
the
short-weighing
brought
the
weight
down
from
100-weight
category
into
a
lower
one
and
in
fact,
in
this
case,
none
of
the
cattle
short-weighed
in
fact
brought
the
weight
down
from
100-weight
category
to
another,
so
that
there
was
no
loss
in
commissions
resulting
from
the
short-weighing.
now,
the
packers
and
stockyards
act
was
of
course
designed
to
eliminate
abuses
such
as
short-weighing.
it
does
this
by
requiring
the
market
agencies
to
observe
a
high
fiduciary
standard
of
care
in
dealing
with
both
buyers
and
sellers.
and
since
negligent
as
well
as
intentional
short-weighing
injures
the
livestock
producers,
negligent
short-weighing
has
long
been
considered
to
be
a
violation
of
the
act.
i
turn
now
to
the
treatment
of
this
case
in
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
no,
i
believe
that
they
have
consistently
maintained
that
their
infractions
of
the
act
where
not
intentional.
on
appeal,
the
court
of
appeals
--
mr.
keith
a.
jones
yes,
we
do
distinguish
between
intentional
and
willful
as
did
the
court
of
appeals.
the
act
is
phrased
in
terms
of
willfulness
and
the
negligent
violations
are
considered
willful
for
purposes
of
the
act.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
well,
i
believe
that
it
means
that
if
you
act
in
careless
disregard
of
your
statutory
responsibilities,
that's
considered
to
be
willfulness
for
purposes
of
the
act.
it
simply
means
that
you
know
what
your
responsibilities
are
and
you
don't
live
up
to
them.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
well,
i
suppose
that
in
this
context,
intentional
would
mean
that,
for
example,
the
respondent
ordered
its
weigh
master
to
weigh
the
cattle
at
less
then
their
true
weight.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
that's
correct.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
i
believe
so,
in
the
sense
that
the
respondent
has
conceded
that
the
suspension
here
was
within
the
statutory
authority
of
the
secretary,
and
of
course,
it
would
not
be
if
the
act
where
not
committed
willfully,
in
other
words,
not
a
violation
of
the
act.
furthermore,
the
court
of
appeals
upheld
the
finding
of
a
violation
as
supported
by
substantial
evidence,
and
the
respondent
is
not
crossed
petitioned
in
this
case,
so
that
the
finding
of
a
violation
of
the
act
is
not
at
issue
here.
however,
although
the
court
of
appeals
sustained
the
cease
and
desist
order
--
mr.
keith
a.
jones
i
don't
recall
mr.
chief
justice.
the
only
issue
presented
of
course
is
whether
the
suspension
itself
was
--
whether
the
court
exceeded
its
permissible
scope
of
reviewing
in
setting
the
sentence
of
suspension.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
and
that's
the
proper
scope
of
reviewing
how
it
is
applied.
well,
the
court
did
set
aside
the
20-day
suspension
here.
it
is
hard
to
determine
just
why
the
suspension
was
set
aside
however.
the
court
expressly
held
that
the
suspension
was
within
the
secretary's
statutory
authority,
and
it
further
acknowledged
that
the
shaping
of
remedies
is
peculiarly
within
the
special
competence
of
the
secretary.
having
acknowledged
its
narrow
powers
of
review
however,
the
court
turned
to
a
comparison
of
this
case
with
four
previous
administrative
decisions
involving
suspensions
for
short-weighing.
in
each
of
those
four
cases,
at
least
in
the
court’s
view,
the
short-weighing
had
been
intentional
and
flagrant.
the
court
did
not
view
the
respondent’s
offense
as
being
equally
culpable,
and
on
the
basis
of
this
comparison
alone,
the
court
concluded
that
the
20-day
suspension
here
failed
to
achieve
uniformity
of
sanctions
for
similar
violations.
in
so
concluding,
the
court
overlooked
the
fact
that
in
those
four
cases
with
which
it
was
comparing
the
present
case,
the
suspensions
there
had
all
been
for
30
days;
longer
than
the
period
of
suspension
here.
and
the
court
further
overlooked
the
fact
that
the
secretary
has
frequently
imposed
suspensions
in
cases
involving
offenses
no
more
culpable
than
those
committed
by
the
respondent.
the
court
then
made
its
own
independent
evaluation
of
the
proper
sanction
to
be
imposed
and
concluded
that
the
cease
and
desist
order,
when
coupled
with
the
adverse
publicity,
which
had
attended
the
finding
of
a
violation,
would
be
inadequate
remedy.
it
is
our
position
that
the
court
of
appeals
merely
paid
lip
service
to
the
applicability
of
a
narrow
standard
of
review,
and
that
it
in
fact
substituted
its
own
judgment
for
that
of
the
secretary
with
respect
to
the
proper
sanction
to
be
employed
for
short-weighing
under
the
act.
i'll
first
outline
our
review
of
what
constitutes
the
proper
standard
of
review
in
cases
such
as
this
and
then
turn
to
a
discussion
of
how
that
standard
should
be
applied
to
the
facts
of
this
case.
this
court
has
repeatedly
stressed
that
the
courts
exercise
only
a
very
limited
power
of
review
over
orders
fashioned
by
an
administrative
agency.
this
limited
power
of
review
has
normally
been
described
as
requiring
the
courts
to
sustain
an
administrative
action,
which
is
authorized
by
statute
and
which
is
not
arbitrary
capricious
or
an
abuse
of
discretion.
although,
in
articulating
the
proper
standard
to
be
applied,
the
court
has
varied
its
language
slightly
from
case
to
case.
the
essential
point
has
remained
clear.
a
reviewing
court
may
not
simply
substitute
its
discretion
for
that
of
the
administrator.
when
discretionary
enforcement
powers
are
given
by
congress
to
the
administrator,
who
thereupon
develops
special
expertise
over
the
subject
matter.
a
reviewing
court
may
not
replace
its
discretion,
i
mean,
may
not
replace
the
administrator’s
discretion
with
its
own.
and
we
believe
that
a
narrow
scope
of
review
is
particularly
appropriate
where
the
administrative
action
in
question
is
the
imposition
of
sanctions
for
statutory
violations.
the
determination
of
what
sanction
is
necessary
to
ensure
compliance
with
the
act
and
to
deter
future
violations
must
be
based
upon
informed
judgment
which
can
properly
be
made
only
by
the
administrator,
who
unlike
the
reviewing
court
is
thoroughly
familiar
with
both
the
conditions
in
the
industry
and
the
real
significance
of
the
particular
violation,
or
the
sanction
chosen
by
the
administrator
can
be
shown
to
have
some
reasonable
relationship
to
his
legitimate
enforcement
objectives
under
the
statute.
we
contend
that
the
sanction
must
be
sustained.
we
believe
that
a
party
attacking
the
sanction
bears
a
very
heavy
burden
of
proof.
that
party
mush
show
that
the
sanction
bears
no
relationship
whatsoever
to
the
effectuation
of
the
statutory
program,
and
is
out
of
all
proportion
to
the
seriousness
of
the
offense.
and
when
as
in
this
case,
the
sanction
employed
is
a
suspension,
we
believe
that,
that
sanction
maybe
modified
or
set
aside
only
when
the
period
of
suspension
is
wholly
lacking
in
reasonableness.
i
turn
now
to
--
mr.
keith
a.
jones
well,
i
think
that
there
must
be
some
--
mr.
keith
a.
jones
i
think
there
must
be
some
reasoned
elaboration.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
yes.
i
will
turn
to
a
discussion
of
those
reasons
in
a
moment.
first,
i
would
say
however
that
i
believe
that
the
use
of
the
word
unconscionable
here
was
not
a
finding
of
an
abuse
of
discretion,
but
really
only
a
conclusory
reassertion,
a
conclusory
description
based
upon
a
presumed
lack
of
uniformity
of
sanctions.
as
such,
it
did
not
constitute
a
finding
that
there
was
no
reasonable
relationship
between
the
sanction
imposed
and
the
need
to
effectuate
the
statutory
program.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
that's
correct.
i
believe
that
a
reviewing
court
cannot
simply
say
that
this
is
an
abuse
of
discretion
without
explaining
why,
and
i
think
that
the
explanations
in
this
case
were
inadequate.
the
violation
committed
--
mr.
keith
a.
jones
no.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
no.
i
think
that
the
court
gave
lip
service
to
in
their
standard
of
review,
but
that
it
did
not
attempt
conscientiously
to
apply
that
standard.
the
violation
committed
by
the
respondent
here,
the
short-weighing
of
cattle
consigned
to
it
for
sale
is
a
serious
offense
under
the
act,
and
furthermore,
this
was
not
the
respondent’s
first
violation.
it
is
been
detected
short-weighing
on
a
total
of
four
separate
occasions.
these
repeated
violations
may
as
the
respondent
seems
to
contend
have
been
merely
due
to
negligence,
carelessness.
if
so,
the
respondent
has
repeatedly
been
careless
in
the
observance
of
its
statutory
responsibilities.
on
the
other
hand,
the
violations
may
have
been
intentional.
the
record
is
unclear
and
the
secretary’s
findings
are
couched
only
in
terms
of
willfulness,
which
is
the
statutory
standard.
whether
intentional
or
careless,
respondent’s
actions
thwarted
the
fundamental
safeguard
devised
by
congress
for
the
protection
of
livestock
producers.
in
contrast
to
the
seriousness
of
the
offense,
the
20-day
suspension
here
is
relevantly
mild.
it
certainly
cannot
be
said
in
the
context
of
the
respondent’s
repeated
violations
that
this
brief
suspension
was
arbitrary
or
lacking
in
reasonableness
or
an
abuse
of
discretion.
congress
has
given
the
secretary
wide
discretion
to
choose
the
sanctions
necessary
to
ensure
compliance
with
the
act.
the
secretary
in
this
case
acted
well
within
his
discretion.
the
court
below
however
was
concerned
with
whether
there
had
been
a
uniformity
of
sanctions
for
similar
violations.
now,
i
would
now
--
first
that
we
believe
the
court
was
in
error
in
concluding
that
there
was
a
lack
of
uniformity
here.
the
department
of
agriculture
has
provided
us
and
opposing
counsel
with
a
comprehensive
list
of
short-weighing
cases,
including
152
cases
involving
suspensions.
now,
these
suspensions
range
in
length
from
a
minimum
of
one
week
to
a
maximum
of
five
years.
now,
some
of
the
violations
were
more
obviously
intentional
than
those
involved
here,
but
many
were
not,
so
that
if
the
history
of
the
enforcement
of
the
act
is
any
guide,
the
sanctions
here
were
if
anything
lenient,
certainly
no
severe.
but
more
importantly,
we
would
submit
that
the
court
fundamentally
erred
and
inquired,
at
least
in
any
strict
and
comprehensive
way
into
the
uniformity
of
sanctions
at
all.
the
secretary
is
not
required
to
impose
the
same
sanction
for
all
similar
violations.
in
federal
communications
commission
against
woko,
which
we
cite
in
our
brief,
the
court
was
once
before
confronted
with
the
argument
that
an
administrator
had
not
applied
similarly
harsh
sanctions
to
violators
in
the
past.
in
holding
that
this
factor
is
not
a
ground
for
ejecting
the
sanction,
the
court
replied,
and
i
quote,
on
page
228
of
that
volume,
“we
cannot
say
that
the
commission
is
bound
to
deal
with
all
cases
at
all
times,
as
it
dealt
with
some
that
seemed
comparable.”
we
believe
that
the
same
answer
is
appropriate
here.
even
if
it
is
assumed
that
respondent’s
suspension
was
harsher
than
those
meted
out
in
the
past,
the
secretary’s
action
we
believe
should
be
measured
not
against
any
past
leniency,
but
only
against
the
need
to
effectuate
the
statutory
program.
so
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
i
believe
that
is
the
answer
to
your
inquiry
about
whether
merely
the
verbalization
of
an
abuse
of
discretion
would
be
adequate,
we
believe
it
is
necessary
to
show
that
there
is
no
reasonable
relationship
between
the
sanction
and
the
need
to
effectuate
the
statutory
program.
the
conclusion
of
the
court’s
opinion
below
illustrates
that
the
court
was
actually
substituting
its
own
judgment
for
that
of
the
secretary
in
not
really
finding
an
abuse
of
discretion.
the
court
expressed
its
view
that
the
cease
and
desist
order,
plus
routine
press
releases
describing
the
finding
of
the
violation
“would
certainly
seem
appropriate
and
reasonable
with
respect
to
the
practice
the
department
seeks
to
eliminate.”
this
statement
by
the
court
reveals
at
least
two
serious
errors.
first,
it
is
for
the
secretary
and
not
the
court
to
determine
what
constitutes
an
appropriate
and
reasonable
sanction
for
purposes
of
carrying
out
the
secretary’s
enforcement
obligations.
and
secondly,
congress
has
made
the
legislative
judgment
that
a
suspension
is
appropriate
and
reasonable
for
any
violation
of
the
act
an
a
fortiori
for
the
serious
violation
of
short-weighing
involved
here.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
that's
correct
mr.
chief
justice,
there
were
repeated
violations.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
i
think
the
court
overlooked
that
as
it
did
i
think
many
other
things
as
well,
relating
to
the
seriousness
of
this
offense
and
to
the
uniformity
of
the
sanctions
which
the
secretary
has
implied
in
the
past.
now
in
conclusion,
we
submit
that
the
decision
setting
aside
the
suspension
ordered
by
the
secretary
should
be
reversed
and
the
suspension
reinstated.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
no.
a
cease
and
desist
order
was
sustained
by
the
court
below.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
that's
all.
i
would
like
to
reserve
my
remaining
time.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
i
would
just
like
to
dispel
one
misimpression.
the
counsel
for
the
respondent
has
asserted
repeatedly
that
the
secretary
has
not
imposed
suspensions
in
cases
where
there
was
no
finding
of
intentional
misconduct.
however,
i
would
like
to
bring
to
the
court’s
attention
the
18
cases
which
we
cite
in
our
footnote
7,
page
20
of
our
merit’s
briefs,
for
there
were
suspensions
--
mr.
keith
a.
jones
page
20
of
our
brief,
footnote
7.
and
in
these
cases,
there
was
a
suspension
issued
for
short-weighing
without
a
finding
of
intentional
misconduct.
and
i
would
particularly
refer
your
attention
to
the
williamstown
stockyards
case,
where
although
it
was
a
consent
order
as
counsel
for
the
respondent
points
out,
the
consent
order
was
conditioned
upon
the
assertion
that
the
offense
was
not
intentional.
nevertheless,
a
suspension,
i
don't
recall
whether
it
was
20
or
30
days,
but
it
was
not
less
than
that
involved
in
this
case,
was
issued.
furthermore,
the
distinction
between
intentional
and
merely
negligent
violations
of
the
act
is
a
very
difficult
one
to
make
in
practice.
for
example,
in
this
case,
all
we
know
for
a
fact
is
that
the
respondent’s
scales
were
accurate
and
that
the
cattle
was
misweighed.
respondent
did
not
call
the
weigh
master
to
testify
as
to
why
there
might
be
a
discrepancy
between
the
true
weight
and
the
weight
given
by
respondent.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
i
can't
answer
that
with
confidence,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
but
i
assume
that
he
could
have
been
called.
i
understand
it's
not
generally
the
practice
to
call
the
employees
of
the
respondent
or
the
person
subject
to
sanction.
so
that
the
distinctions
made
between
intentional
and
negligent
misconduct
are
really
very
difficult
ones
to
make,
and
in
this
case,
as
in
almost
all
cases,
the
final
finding
of
the
secretary
was
simply
one
of
willfulness
and
not
one
of
intentional
misconduct.
and
as
the
willful
violation,
which
in
almost
all
these
cases
is
the
one
which
is
subject
to
sanction.
that's
all
i
have.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
eight
circuit.
the
issue
presented
is
whether
the
court
below
exceeded
the
permissible
scope
of
review
in
setting
aside
the
secretary’s
20-day
suspension
of
respondent
as
a
registrant
under
the
packers
and
stockyards
act
of
1921.
the
suspension
was
ordered,
pursuant
to
the
secretary’s
authority
to
suspend
for
a
reasonable
period
any
registrant
committing
any
violation
of
the
act.
respondent
is
a
livestock
broker
for
a
market
agency,
who
is
paid
a
sales
commission
for
conducting
an
auction
of
which
livestock
is
sold
on
a
weight
basis.
respondent
has
now
been
detected
violating
the
act
on
four
separate
occasions
by
short-weighing
cattle
consigned
to
it
for
sale.
on
the
earlier
occasions,
it
had
simply
been
warned
against
future
violations.
on
the
fourth
instance
of
short-weighing,
which
is
the
subject
of
this
suit,
a
formal
complaint
against
respondent
was
issued
by
the
packers
and
stockyards
administration.
the
case
was
initially
tried
before
department
of
agriculture
hearing
examiner.
it
found
that
respondent
had
intentionally
short-weighed
the
cattle
consigned
to
it
for
sale.
the
hearing
examiner
recommended
an
appropriate
cease
and
desist
order
and
also
a
30-day
suspension.
the
matter
was
then
reviewed
by
a
judicial
officer
having
authority
to
act
on
behalf
of
the
secretary.
he
found
that
respondent
short-weighing
constituted
a
willful
violation
of
the
act
and
he
issued
the
cease
and
desist
order
recommended
by
the
hearing
examiner,
but
he
reduced
respondent’s
suspension
to
only
20
days.
since
the
respondent
operates
its
market
only
one
day
per
week,
this
20-day
suspension
will
affect
at
most
three
business
days.
before
discussing
the
disposition
of
this
case
on
appeal,
i
think
it
will
be
helpful
to
describe
the
respondent’s
brokerage
function
as
a
market
agency
and
to
explain
why
a
market
agency
like
the
respondent
might
intentionally
short-weigh
the
cattle
consigned
to
it
for
sale.
the
sellers
at
respondent’s
auctions
are
typically
livestock
producers,
who
bring
or
send
their
cattle
to
the
respondent
for
purposes
of
the
auction.
these
livestock
producers
rarely
know
the
true
weight
of
their
cattle.
they
typically
lack
the
weighing
facilities
necessary
to
determine
the
true
weight.
it
is
the
respondent
who
is
responsible
for
weighing
the
cattle.
the
buyers
at
the
auction
frequently,
perhaps
usually,
are
representatives
of
meatpacking
companies.
they
buy
the
cattle
at
the
weight
given
by
the
respondent
and
the
cattle
are
then
shipped
to
the
packing
plants
where
they
are
reweighed.
the
sad
truth
of
the
matter
is
that
the
packers
tend
to
patronize
the
auctions
held
by
market
agencies,
which
give
them
a
favorable
break
on
the
weight,
thus,
short-weighing
encourages
buyers.
and
this
in
turn
stimulates
an
increase
in
sales,
for
the
livestock
producers
will
tend
to
patronize
the
markets
which
attract
sufficient
buyers
to
ensure
a
sale
of
their
cattle,
and
since
the
market
agencies
are
paid
on
a
per
head
basis,
they
profit
from
this
higher
level
of
sales.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
it's
based
--
and
i
think
that
in
the
record
there
is
a
schedule
of
the
commission,
that
is
based
in
part
on
the
weight
of
the
cattle.
if
the
cattle
in
question
weighs
400
pounds
or
more,
i
think
the
sales
commission
is
$4
and
some
odd
cents.
if
it
is
between
300
and
399
pounds,
it
is
a
lower
figure,
and
so
forth.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
only
if
the
short-weighing
brought
the
weight
down
from
100-weight
category
into
a
lower
one
and
in
fact,
in
this
case,
none
of
the
cattle
short-weighed
in
fact
brought
the
weight
down
from
100-weight
category
to
another,
so
that
there
was
no
loss
in
commissions
resulting
from
the
short-weighing.
now,
the
packers
and
stockyards
act
was
of
course
designed
to
eliminate
abuses
such
as
short-weighing.
it
does
this
by
requiring
the
market
agencies
to
observe
a
high
fiduciary
standard
of
care
in
dealing
with
both
buyers
and
sellers.
and
since
negligent
as
well
as
intentional
short-weighing
injures
the
livestock
producers,
negligent
short-weighing
has
long
been
considered
to
be
a
violation
of
the
act.
i
turn
now
to
the
treatment
of
this
case
in
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
no,
i
believe
that
they
have
consistently
maintained
that
their
infractions
of
the
act
where
not
intentional.
on
appeal,
the
court
of
appeals
--
mr.
keith
a.
jones
yes,
we
do
distinguish
between
intentional
and
willful
as
did
the
court
of
appeals.
the
act
is
phrased
in
terms
of
willfulness
and
the
negligent
violations
are
considered
willful
for
purposes
of
the
act.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
well,
i
believe
that
it
means
that
if
you
act
in
careless
disregard
of
your
statutory
responsibilities,
that's
considered
to
be
willfulness
for
purposes
of
the
act.
it
simply
means
that
you
know
what
your
responsibilities
are
and
you
don't
live
up
to
them.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
well,
i
suppose
that
in
this
context,
intentional
would
mean
that,
for
example,
the
respondent
ordered
its
weigh
master
to
weigh
the
cattle
at
less
then
their
true
weight.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
that's
correct.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
i
believe
so,
in
the
sense
that
the
respondent
has
conceded
that
the
suspension
here
was
within
the
statutory
authority
of
the
secretary,
and
of
course,
it
would
not
be
if
the
act
where
not
committed
willfully,
in
other
words,
not
a
violation
of
the
act.
furthermore,
the
court
of
appeals
upheld
the
finding
of
a
violation
as
supported
by
substantial
evidence,
and
the
respondent
is
not
crossed
petitioned
in
this
case,
so
that
the
finding
of
a
violation
of
the
act
is
not
at
issue
here.
however,
although
the
court
of
appeals
sustained
the
cease
and
desist
order
--
mr.
keith
a.
jones
i
don't
recall
mr.
chief
justice.
the
only
issue
presented
of
course
is
whether
the
suspension
itself
was
--
whether
the
court
exceeded
its
permissible
scope
of
reviewing
in
setting
the
sentence
of
suspension.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
and
that's
the
proper
scope
of
reviewing
how
it
is
applied.
well,
the
court
did
set
aside
the
20-day
suspension
here.
it
is
hard
to
determine
just
why
the
suspension
was
set
aside
however.
the
court
expressly
held
that
the
suspension
was
within
the
secretary's
statutory
authority,
and
it
further
acknowledged
that
the
shaping
of
remedies
is
peculiarly
within
the
special
competence
of
the
secretary.
having
acknowledged
its
narrow
powers
of
review
however,
the
court
turned
to
a
comparison
of
this
case
with
four
previous
administrative
decisions
involving
suspensions
for
short-weighing.
in
each
of
those
four
cases,
at
least
in
the
court’s
view,
the
short-weighing
had
been
intentional
and
flagrant.
the
court
did
not
view
the
respondent’s
offense
as
being
equally
culpable,
and
on
the
basis
of
this
comparison
alone,
the
court
concluded
that
the
20-day
suspension
here
failed
to
achieve
uniformity
of
sanctions
for
similar
violations.
in
so
concluding,
the
court
overlooked
the
fact
that
in
those
four
cases
with
which
it
was
comparing
the
present
case,
the
suspensions
there
had
all
been
for
30
days;
longer
than
the
period
of
suspension
here.
and
the
court
further
overlooked
the
fact
that
the
secretary
has
frequently
imposed
suspensions
in
cases
involving
offenses
no
more
culpable
than
those
committed
by
the
respondent.
the
court
then
made
its
own
independent
evaluation
of
the
proper
sanction
to
be
imposed
and
concluded
that
the
cease
and
desist
order,
when
coupled
with
the
adverse
publicity,
which
had
attended
the
finding
of
a
violation,
would
be
inadequate
remedy.
it
is
our
position
that
the
court
of
appeals
merely
paid
lip
service
to
the
applicability
of
a
narrow
standard
of
review,
and
that
it
in
fact
substituted
its
own
judgment
for
that
of
the
secretary
with
respect
to
the
proper
sanction
to
be
employed
for
short-weighing
under
the
act.
i'll
first
outline
our
review
of
what
constitutes
the
proper
standard
of
review
in
cases
such
as
this
and
then
turn
to
a
discussion
of
how
that
standard
should
be
applied
to
the
facts
of
this
case.
this
court
has
repeatedly
stressed
that
the
courts
exercise
only
a
very
limited
power
of
review
over
orders
fashioned
by
an
administrative
agency.
this
limited
power
of
review
has
normally
been
described
as
requiring
the
courts
to
sustain
an
administrative
action,
which
is
authorized
by
statute
and
which
is
not
arbitrary
capricious
or
an
abuse
of
discretion.
although,
in
articulating
the
proper
standard
to
be
applied,
the
court
has
varied
its
language
slightly
from
case
to
case.
the
essential
point
has
remained
clear.
a
reviewing
court
may
not
simply
substitute
its
discretion
for
that
of
the
administrator.
when
discretionary
enforcement
powers
are
given
by
congress
to
the
administrator,
who
thereupon
develops
special
expertise
over
the
subject
matter.
a
reviewing
court
may
not
replace
its
discretion,
i
mean,
may
not
replace
the
administrator’s
discretion
with
its
own.
and
we
believe
that
a
narrow
scope
of
review
is
particularly
appropriate
where
the
administrative
action
in
question
is
the
imposition
of
sanctions
for
statutory
violations.
the
determination
of
what
sanction
is
necessary
to
ensure
compliance
with
the
act
and
to
deter
future
violations
must
be
based
upon
informed
judgment
which
can
properly
be
made
only
by
the
administrator,
who
unlike
the
reviewing
court
is
thoroughly
familiar
with
both
the
conditions
in
the
industry
and
the
real
significance
of
the
particular
violation,
or
the
sanction
chosen
by
the
administrator
can
be
shown
to
have
some
reasonable
relationship
to
his
legitimate
enforcement
objectives
under
the
statute.
we
contend
that
the
sanction
must
be
sustained.
we
believe
that
a
party
attacking
the
sanction
bears
a
very
heavy
burden
of
proof.
that
party
mush
show
that
the
sanction
bears
no
relationship
whatsoever
to
the
effectuation
of
the
statutory
program,
and
is
out
of
all
proportion
to
the
seriousness
of
the
offense.
and
when
as
in
this
case,
the
sanction
employed
is
a
suspension,
we
believe
that,
that
sanction
maybe
modified
or
set
aside
only
when
the
period
of
suspension
is
wholly
lacking
in
reasonableness.
i
turn
now
to
--
mr.
keith
a.
jones
well,
i
think
that
there
must
be
some
--
mr.
keith
a.
jones
i
think
there
must
be
some
reasoned
elaboration.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
yes.
i
will
turn
to
a
discussion
of
those
reasons
in
a
moment.
first,
i
would
say
however
that
i
believe
that
the
use
of
the
word
unconscionable
here
was
not
a
finding
of
an
abuse
of
discretion,
but
really
only
a
conclusory
reassertion,
a
conclusory
description
based
upon
a
presumed
lack
of
uniformity
of
sanctions.
as
such,
it
did
not
constitute
a
finding
that
there
was
no
reasonable
relationship
between
the
sanction
imposed
and
the
need
to
effectuate
the
statutory
program.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
that's
correct.
i
believe
that
a
reviewing
court
cannot
simply
say
that
this
is
an
abuse
of
discretion
without
explaining
why,
and
i
think
that
the
explanations
in
this
case
were
inadequate.
the
violation
committed
--
mr.
keith
a.
jones
no.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
no.
i
think
that
the
court
gave
lip
service
to
in
their
standard
of
review,
but
that
it
did
not
attempt
conscientiously
to
apply
that
standard.
the
violation
committed
by
the
respondent
here,
the
short-weighing
of
cattle
consigned
to
it
for
sale
is
a
serious
offense
under
the
act,
and
furthermore,
this
was
not
the
respondent’s
first
violation.
it
is
been
detected
short-weighing
on
a
total
of
four
separate
occasions.
these
repeated
violations
may
as
the
respondent
seems
to
contend
have
been
merely
due
to
negligence,
carelessness.
if
so,
the
respondent
has
repeatedly
been
careless
in
the
observance
of
its
statutory
responsibilities.
on
the
other
hand,
the
violations
may
have
been
intentional.
the
record
is
unclear
and
the
secretary’s
findings
are
couched
only
in
terms
of
willfulness,
which
is
the
statutory
standard.
whether
intentional
or
careless,
respondent’s
actions
thwarted
the
fundamental
safeguard
devised
by
congress
for
the
protection
of
livestock
producers.
in
contrast
to
the
seriousness
of
the
offense,
the
20-day
suspension
here
is
relevantly
mild.
it
certainly
cannot
be
said
in
the
context
of
the
respondent’s
repeated
violations
that
this
brief
suspension
was
arbitrary
or
lacking
in
reasonableness
or
an
abuse
of
discretion.
congress
has
given
the
secretary
wide
discretion
to
choose
the
sanctions
necessary
to
ensure
compliance
with
the
act.
the
secretary
in
this
case
acted
well
within
his
discretion.
the
court
below
however
was
concerned
with
whether
there
had
been
a
uniformity
of
sanctions
for
similar
violations.
now,
i
would
now
--
first
that
we
believe
the
court
was
in
error
in
concluding
that
there
was
a
lack
of
uniformity
here.
the
department
of
agriculture
has
provided
us
and
opposing
counsel
with
a
comprehensive
list
of
short-weighing
cases,
including
152
cases
involving
suspensions.
now,
these
suspensions
range
in
length
from
a
minimum
of
one
week
to
a
maximum
of
five
years.
now,
some
of
the
violations
were
more
obviously
intentional
than
those
involved
here,
but
many
were
not,
so
that
if
the
history
of
the
enforcement
of
the
act
is
any
guide,
the
sanctions
here
were
if
anything
lenient,
certainly
no
severe.
but
more
importantly,
we
would
submit
that
the
court
fundamentally
erred
and
inquired,
at
least
in
any
strict
and
comprehensive
way
into
the
uniformity
of
sanctions
at
all.
the
secretary
is
not
required
to
impose
the
same
sanction
for
all
similar
violations.
in
federal
communications
commission
against
woko,
which
we
cite
in
our
brief,
the
court
was
once
before
confronted
with
the
argument
that
an
administrator
had
not
applied
similarly
harsh
sanctions
to
violators
in
the
past.
in
holding
that
this
factor
is
not
a
ground
for
ejecting
the
sanction,
the
court
replied,
and
i
quote,
on
page
228
of
that
volume,
“we
cannot
say
that
the
commission
is
bound
to
deal
with
all
cases
at
all
times,
as
it
dealt
with
some
that
seemed
comparable.”
we
believe
that
the
same
answer
is
appropriate
here.
even
if
it
is
assumed
that
respondent’s
suspension
was
harsher
than
those
meted
out
in
the
past,
the
secretary’s
action
we
believe
should
be
measured
not
against
any
past
leniency,
but
only
against
the
need
to
effectuate
the
statutory
program.
so
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
i
believe
that
is
the
answer
to
your
inquiry
about
whether
merely
the
verbalization
of
an
abuse
of
discretion
would
be
adequate,
we
believe
it
is
necessary
to
show
that
there
is
no
reasonable
relationship
between
the
sanction
and
the
need
to
effectuate
the
statutory
program.
the
conclusion
of
the
court’s
opinion
below
illustrates
that
the
court
was
actually
substituting
its
own
judgment
for
that
of
the
secretary
in
not
really
finding
an
abuse
of
discretion.
the
court
expressed
its
view
that
the
cease
and
desist
order,
plus
routine
press
releases
describing
the
finding
of
the
violation
“would
certainly
seem
appropriate
and
reasonable
with
respect
to
the
practice
the
department
seeks
to
eliminate.”
this
statement
by
the
court
reveals
at
least
two
serious
errors.
first,
it
is
for
the
secretary
and
not
the
court
to
determine
what
constitutes
an
appropriate
and
reasonable
sanction
for
purposes
of
carrying
out
the
secretary’s
enforcement
obligations.
and
secondly,
congress
has
made
the
legislative
judgment
that
a
suspension
is
appropriate
and
reasonable
for
any
violation
of
the
act
an
a
fortiori
for
the
serious
violation
of
short-weighing
involved
here.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
that's
correct
mr.
chief
justice,
there
were
repeated
violations.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
i
think
the
court
overlooked
that
as
it
did
i
think
many
other
things
as
well,
relating
to
the
seriousness
of
this
offense
and
to
the
uniformity
of
the
sanctions
which
the
secretary
has
implied
in
the
past.
now
in
conclusion,
we
submit
that
the
decision
setting
aside
the
suspension
ordered
by
the
secretary
should
be
reversed
and
the
suspension
reinstated.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
no.
a
cease
and
desist
order
was
sustained
by
the
court
below.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
that's
all.
i
would
like
to
reserve
my
remaining
time.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
i
would
just
like
to
dispel
one
misimpression.
the
counsel
for
the
respondent
has
asserted
repeatedly
that
the
secretary
has
not
imposed
suspensions
in
cases
where
there
was
no
finding
of
intentional
misconduct.
however,
i
would
like
to
bring
to
the
court’s
attention
the
18
cases
which
we
cite
in
our
footnote
7,
page
20
of
our
merit’s
briefs,
for
there
were
suspensions
--
mr.
keith
a.
jones
page
20
of
our
brief,
footnote
7.
and
in
these
cases,
there
was
a
suspension
issued
for
short-weighing
without
a
finding
of
intentional
misconduct.
and
i
would
particularly
refer
your
attention
to
the
williamstown
stockyards
case,
where
although
it
was
a
consent
order
as
counsel
for
the
respondent
points
out,
the
consent
order
was
conditioned
upon
the
assertion
that
the
offense
was
not
intentional.
nevertheless,
a
suspension,
i
don't
recall
whether
it
was
20
or
30
days,
but
it
was
not
less
than
that
involved
in
this
case,
was
issued.
furthermore,
the
distinction
between
intentional
and
merely
negligent
violations
of
the
act
is
a
very
difficult
one
to
make
in
practice.
for
example,
in
this
case,
all
we
know
for
a
fact
is
that
the
respondent’s
scales
were
accurate
and
that
the
cattle
was
misweighed.
respondent
did
not
call
the
weigh
master
to
testify
as
to
why
there
might
be
a
discrepancy
between
the
true
weight
and
the
weight
given
by
respondent.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
i
can't
answer
that
with
confidence,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
but
i
assume
that
he
could
have
been
called.
i
understand
it's
not
generally
the
practice
to
call
the
employees
of
the
respondent
or
the
person
subject
to
sanction.
so
that
the
distinctions
made
between
intentional
and
negligent
misconduct
are
really
very
difficult
ones
to
make,
and
in
this
case,
as
in
almost
all
cases,
the
final
finding
of
the
secretary
was
simply
one
of
willfulness
and
not
one
of
intentional
misconduct.
and
as
the
willful
violation,
which
in
almost
all
these
cases
is
the
one
which
is
subject
to
sanction.
that's
all
i
have.
