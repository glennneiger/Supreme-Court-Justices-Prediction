justice
byron
r.
white
and
denied
that
they
were
willful
or
do
you
distinguish
between
intentional
and
willful?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
think
you
know
what
you
are
doing?
i
mean,
you
know,
what
people
actually
are
going
through?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
is
intentional?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
there
is
no
concession
for
it
being
intentional?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
there
a
concession
that
they
were
willful?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
statute
they
use
is
all
right
here?
justice
byron
r.
white
only
their
explanations?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
upshot
was
that
no
punishment
or
remedy
whatsoever
was
to
be
imposed?
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
all?
justice
byron
r.
white
yeah,
well
i
used
to
litigate
against
small
town
lawyers
(inaudible)
and
it
was
almost
(inaudible)[attempt
to
laughter]
justice
byron
r.
white
that
is
actually
what
i
thought.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
are
saying
that
since
there
has
been
violation
of
the,
what,
the
secretary’s
own
rules?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
he
for
the
first
time
imposed
the
suspension,
was
it
not
an
intention
of
violation?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
he
imposed
the
penalty
though?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
are
saying
that
the
--
because
this
is
the
first
time
the
sentence
(inaudible)?
justice
byron
r.
white
then
you
have
–
where
you
have
non-intentional,
non-intentional
violation,
you
either
get
them
both
--
either
suspend
them
both
or
not
suspend
them
both?
justice
byron
r.
white
he
could
be
starting
on
a
program
of
suspending
everybody?
justice
byron
r.
white
he
might
have
changed
his
mind.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
don't
know,
that
isn't
an
issue
here
right
now.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
am
not
even
sure
that's
part
of
the
record.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
not
with
respect
to
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
what
do
you
understand
willful
means
in
terms
of
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
oh
yes,
but
is
that
all
that
willful
means?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
didn't
know
you
were
short-weighing?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
did
one
physical
action
of
going
through
and
you
were
careless,
that's
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
whatever
the
reason,
but
nevertheless
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you're
saying
that
the
secretary
may
not
suspend
a
willful
violator?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
--
justice
byron
r.
white
that
he
has
to
put
him
with
the
negligence
of
violator
rather
than
with
the
intentional?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
never
thought
they
could
be
second
if
you
set
the
first
one
aside,
it
would
always
be
a
first?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
you
set
it
aside
and
say
it
is
unjustified,
and
this
will
again
be
the
first?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
denied
that
they
were
willful
or
do
you
distinguish
between
