mr.
r.
a.
eilbott,
jr.
may
it
please
--
mr.
r.
a.
eilbott,
jr.
--
the
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
your
honors,
gentlemen
of
the
court.
i
think
we
came
here
or
i
thought
i
did
to
argue
some
degree
of
law,
but
there
have
been
so
many
statements
affect
given,
which
i
do
not
agree
with,
and
which
can
only
be
thought
of
as
prejudicial
to
my
clients,
but
i
think
i
should
answer
just
a
few
of
those
before
i
go
into
what
i
had
intended
to
say
to
this
court.
now,
number
one,
we
have
the
statement
by
mr.
jones
and
may
i
say
to
your
honors
before
i
go
further
that
i
am
a
small
country
town
lawyer.
mr.
jones
has
been
most
cooperative
to
us
and
most
kind
to
us
in
the
preparation
of
our
appearances
before
your
honors,
because
i
have
never
had
that
privilege
before,
except
when
i
was
admitted.
mr.
r.
a.
eilbott,
jr.
well,
that's
what
i
hope
to
do
to
mr.
jones.
mr.
r.
a.
eilbott,
jr.
yes
sir.[laughter]
that's
exactly
what
i
intend
to
do
or
if
i
can.
mr.
r.
a.
eilbott,
jr.
i
wish
i
had
one
law
book
your
honor.[laughter]
he
first
makes
mention
however
that
we
had
been
told
four
times.
now,
if
it
please
your
honors,
let
me
get
one
thing
straight,
because
i
have
now
lived
with
this
case
for
three-and-a-half
years.
we
did
receive
three
letters
on
the
question
of
weighing,
and
the
record
shows
that
in
each
and
every
instance
we
immediately
had
weighed
scale
testers
in
to
determine
what
the
condition
was
of
our
scales
and
unfortunately,
we
got
no
answers
on
those
first
three
occasions.
we
would
urge
your
honors
that
in
--
and
the
transcripts
so
shows
that
this
was
found
to
be
true,
that
if
you
weighed
these
scales
as
was
required
by
the
government,
that
is
put
a
weight
on
each
corner
and
weighed
it,
they
found
nothing
wrong
with
our
scales.
and
indeed,
nothing
was
found
wrong
with
these
scales
until,
at
my
repeated
urging,
they
brought
in
a
gentleman
from
memphis
who
had
been
selling
scales
and
had
been
using
scales,
fairbanks-morse
scales
for
20
some
odd
years,
he
testified,
it's
part
of
the
record.
he
showed
that
those
scales
had
enough
wear
and
tear
that
when
a
cattle
rushed
on
to
the
scale,
not
withstanding
the
scales
would
prove
correct
at
a
dead
weight,
but
when
you
prodded
one
on
with
an
electric
prod,
which
is
a
system,
that
when
it
hit
the
metal
of
that
scale,
there
was
going
to
be
some
variant
sometimes.
now,
sometimes
the
scales
would
rare
--
would
weigh
accurately,
other
times,
they
would
not.
mr.
r.
a.
eilbott,
jr.
that
is
correct,
your
honor,
he
certainly
did
justice
marshall.
now,
when
we
come
down
to
the
question
here
of
how
many
--
mr.
r.
a.
eilbott,
jr.
yes
sir.[luncheon
recess]
mr.
r.
a.
eilbott,
jr.
may
it
please
the
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
truthfully
gentlemen,
when
we
get
through
sparring
and
there
are
several
things
that
i
would
like
to
answer
from
the
solicitor
general,
we're
here
on
the
matter
of
a
20-day
suspension.
we
could
have,
if
it
please
your
honors,
and
the
court
record
will
show,
we
could
have
taken
the
30-day
suspension
the
day
they
filed
the
complaint,
or
in
plain
language,
we
could
have
taken
our
medicine
for
30
days
and
that
would
have
been
all
there
had
been
to
it,
it
would
all
have
been
over.
mr.
r.
a.
eilbott,
jr.
your
honor,
that's
about
three
working
days.
the
government
is
correct
on
that,
but
they
have
no
more
conception
of
what
those
three
working
days
are
to
us,
to
anything
in
this
world.
what
those
three
working
days
amount
to,
i
think
chief
--
mr.
justice
leah
in
the
eight
circuit
court
of
appeals
very
aptly
put
it.
they
amount
to
calling
us
crooks,
and
we
are
not
crooks
and
that's
what
we
stand
before
this
court
on
today.
we
did
not
intentionally
violate
any
regulation.
we
did
not
intentionally,
if
it
please
your
honor,
deliberately
underweigh
our
overweigh
cattle.
in
the
first
place,
the
government
says
that
we
were
warned
four
times,
and
each
of
those
instances
--
three
times,
and
in
each
of
those
instances,
we
had
the
government’s
own
weighing
team
to
check
our
scales,
and
they
couldn't
report
anything
wrong
to
us
because
there
they
used
the
four
edges
of
balance.
that's
what
the
record
shows.
it
was
only
when
we
tore
those
scales
down
that
we
found
out
what
was
wrong
with
the
scales,
or
what
could
have
been
wrong
with
the
scales.
now,
the
government
says,
that
was
not
mentioned
by
the
eight
circuit
court
of
appeals,
but
indeed,
if
it
please
your
honors,
it
was
mentioned
not
once
but
twice
in
their
opinion,
and
if
your
honors
look
at
the
appendix
that
is
on
page
16
and
19,
the
eight
circuit
--
mr.
r.
a.
eilbott,
jr.
well
then
--
mr.
r.
a.
eilbott,
jr.
well
--
mr.
r.
a.
eilbott,
jr.
if
your
honor
would
look
at
appendix
a
to
the
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari,
on
page
16,
you
would
find
glover
is
an
operator
of
a
posted
stockyard
in
pine
bluff,
arkansas,
registered
so
forth,
to
sell
livestock,
honored
by
june
2,
1964,
july
26,
1966,
and
june
20,
1967,
representatives
of
the
usda
conducted
investigations
of
so
forth
and
so
on,
and
it
goes
on.
then
on
page
19,
it
also
points
out
in
another
place
that
these
matters
where
brought
to
the
attention
of
the
eight
circuit
court
of
appeals,
and
they
mentioned
them
in
their
finding
and
in
their
decree.
we
would
respectfully
point
out
also
that
in
three
of
those
instances,
there
was
no
evidence
taken,
nothing,
other
than
to
say
you're
not
weighing
properly,
and
we
called
in
a
scale
examiner,
one
who
was
approved
by
the
federal
government.
they
could
give
us
no
answers.
the
agricultural
department
made
no
effort
to
give
us
any
answers.
so
consequently,
when
it
came
to
the
eight
circuit
court
of
appeals,
we
have
had
a
situation
where
the
eight
circuit
court
of
appeals
found
specifically
that
it
was
not
an
intentional
and
flagrant
violation,
and
that
also
is
in
the
eight
circuit
court
of
appeals
opinion,
if
it
please
your
honor,
it's
on
page
9
of
our
brief,
but
i
am
sure
it's
in
the
appendix.
i
didn't
go
to
that
trouble
to
find
it
out,
but
most
assuredly,
they
found
no
intentional
violation.
we
have
had
a
situation
that
i
would
like
to
bring
to
the
attention
of
this
court.
the
word
unconscionable
has
come
in,
and
mr.
jones
states
the
really
the
eight
circuit
didn't
give
any
reason
for
that
word,
but
gentlemen,
they
did.
they
most
assuredly
did,
in
the
last
paragraph
of
their
opinion.
they
pointed
out
exactly
why
they
thought
it
was
unconscionable.
i
don't
think
there
is
any
doubt
about
it.
they
found
out
that
these
press
releases
which
mr.
jones
a
few
moments
ago
says,
i've
forgotten
what
he
called
them,
routine
press
releases
i
believe,
well,
we're
in
the
unenviable
position
that
we
found
out
we
had
been
charged
with
an
offense
in
the
newspaper.
everything
that
was
done
in
this
case
was
in
the
newspaper.
routine
press
releases,
if
they
be
routine,
they
damaged
us,
they
damaged
us
to
the
point
that
truthfully
and
honestly,
if
it
wasn't
at
my
own
insistence,
we
wouldn't
be
here
today
because
we're
not
financially
able
to
be
here,
but
we're
here.
we're
still
saying
we
didn't
intentionally
do
anything.
we
didn't
intentionally
do
it
and
we're
not
crooks.
that's
what
it
amounts
to.
now
they
say
we
short-weighed
cattle.
there
were
29
drafts,
i
believe
it
was
proven
to
have
been
weighed,
whether
or
not
those
cattle
had
any
access
to
water,
which
would
have
caused
them
to
gain
weight
or
not,
i
am
not
in
the
position
to
say,
but
if
it
please
you
justices,
neither
was
the
government,
because
they
weren't
there
either.
i
know
one
thing,
of
the
29
drafts
weighed,
nine
were
underweighed,
nine
were
overweighed,
and
the
rest
were
right
on
the
spot,
and
i
want
to
say
to
you
that
of
the
nine
underweighed,
two
of
them,
two
out
of
the
nine
belonged
to
one
of
my
clients,
who
is
selling
his
own
cattle
to
the
livestock
commission
agency.
in
other
words,
if
anybody
got
cheated
on
those
two,
it
was
thomas
glover
who
owns
part
of
glover
livestock
commission
agency.
now,
that
doesn't
make
sense
to
me
that
we
would
intentionally
cheat
ourselves.
now,
the
government
has
used
the
argument
that
i
have
heard
since
the
first
day
we
heard
this
before
a
hearing
examiner,
and
let
me
digress
just
one
minute
and
say
that
the
way
we
heard
this
matter
is
simply
this.
the
government
through
the
agricultural
department
charges
us
with
an
offense.
that's
heard
before
a
hearing
examiner
who
is
an
employee
of
the
agricultural
department.
that's
heard
with
two
witnesses
from
the
agricultural
department.
that's
heard
with
prosecutors,
two
of
them
from
the
agricultural
department,
and
from
that
we
had
an
appeal
to
a
judicial
review
officer
who
also
is
an
employee
of
the
agricultural
department.
and
that
was
what
we
got
in
the
way
of
a
hearing
until
we
got
to
the
eight
circuit
court
of
appeals,
and
i
would
be
the
first
to
admit
that
they
do
have
somewhat
limited
powers
of
review,
but
congress
never
intended
that
the
judiciary
abrogate
all
of
its
powers
to
the
regulatory
commissions.
certainly,
if
it
did,
it
should
have
said
so.
we
have
been
told
here
that
--
the
reason
that
we
did
this,
the
reason
we
short-weighed
was
because
if
we
short-weighed
them
when
we
weighed
the
cattle,
then
the
buyer
got
more
than
he
paid
for
and
he
was
happy.
i
have
heard
that
now
for
three-and-a-half
years,
but
that
isn't
the
truth
either,
and
i
don't
mean
to
imply
that
anyone
is
fibbing.
i
mean
to
say
that's
a
matter
of
philosophy.
the
truth
about
the
matter
is,
in
the
conduct
of
livestock
commission
agents,
whoever
has
got
the
cattle
to
sell,
the
buyers
will
come.
you
don't
need
to
worry
about
getting
buyers
if
you
can
get
the
farmer
to
bring
you
the
cattle.
we
don't
have
to
underweigh
the
farmer’s
cattle
and
give
armor
a
little
excess,
10
or
15
pounds.
mr.
r.
a.
eilbott,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
--
mr.
r.
a.
eilbott,
jr.
excuse
me
sir.
mr.
r.
a.
eilbott,
jr.
yes
sir,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
that
was
what
i
was
prepared
to
argue
until
i
came
this
morning,
and
i
found
that
it
was
stated
that
the
court
of
appeals
had
not
considered
this,
that,
and
the
other,
and
i
knew
the
court
of
appeals
had,
because
it
was
in
their
opinion.
i
will
gladly
move
along
into
what
we
are
really
here
for.
the
appellee
here
concedes
that
the
judicial
review
by
the
eight
circuit
court
of
appeals;
whether
it
be
good
law
or
bad
law,
is
a
limited
review,
but
we
say
to
you,
in
all
sincerity,
that
there
has
been
absolutely
no
proof
and
the
eight
circuit
court
of
appeals
so
found
that
there
was
any
intentional
violation
of
the
statute
or
the
regulation.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
there
is
none.
we
have
asked
the
department
of
agriculture,
we
have
requested
of
the
solicitor
general
that
they
show
us
one
case
in
which
the
department,
without
a
finding
of
intentional,
can
say
that
a
suspension
is
in
order.
we
didn't
place
into
the
law
the
requirement
that
these
orders
be
uniform.
indeed,
this
court
did
not
place
that
into
the
law.
the
secretary
of
agriculture
himself
said
that
the
findings
of
the
department
of
agriculture
should
be
uniform,
because
otherwise
they
would
be
discriminatory.
and
that
is
in
the
much
cited
case
of
royce
versus
–
doing
business
with
madison
stockyard,
which
is
a
department
of
agriculture
case.
we
are
here
saying
merely
one
thing.
the
department
of
agriculture
may
have
found
that
there
was
a
proper
reason
for
suspension
of
our
license
for
20
days,
but
if
they
did,
they
didn't
set
it
out
in
their
opinion
and
neither
did
the
eight
circuit
court
of
appeals.
yet
as
the
eight
circuit
said
and
as
the
department
of
agriculture
has
said,
these
rulings
must
be
uniform.
mr.
jones
mentioned
a
150
cases,
but
those
were
not
cases,
that
was
a
mere
citation
at
the
bottom
of
a
page
that
merely
mentioned
rulings
of
the
department;
whether
they
were
consent
cases,
those
in
which
a
person
had
consented
to
be
suspended,
which
most
of
these
cases
end
up
being,
or
whether
they
where
actually
tried,
or
whether
they
were
entered
on
an
original
order.
mr.
r.
a.
eilbott,
jr.
your
honor,
we
find
no
case,
and
we
have
asked
the
department
to
show
us
a
case
in
which
it
has
been
tried
or
otherwise
where
they
have
made
a
finding
that
--
had
not
made
a
finding
that
it
was
intentional
and
suspended
of
business,
not
a
one
and
i
say
to
you
today,
standing
in
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states,
we
have
not
found
a
single
case.
absence,
the
finding
of
intentional
violation
that
a
suspension
order
has
been
issued
by
the
secretary
of
agriculture
up
to
the
day
he
issued
our
order
and--
mr.
r.
a.
eilbott,
jr.
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
r.
a.
eilbott,
jr.
i
don't
think
there
was
evidence
there
justice
marshall
to
support
such
a
finding.
may
i
quote
one
--
mr.
r.
a.
eilbott,
jr.
yes
sir,
and
if
they
did,
i
think
they
could,
yes.
and
if
they
did
--
mr.
r.
a.
eilbott,
jr.
they
may
have
taken
it
over
only
because
they
found
--
mr.
r.
a.
eilbott,
jr.
i
think
they
do,
unless
you
would
read
the
stockyard
and
packers
act
as
a
complete
abrogation
of
judicial
review.
mr.
r.
a.
eilbott,
jr.
i
understand
that.
mr.
r.
a.
eilbott,
jr.
what
makes
it
--
mr.
r.
a.
eilbott,
jr.
i
think
the
eight
circuit
could
have
sent
it
back,
but
they
chose
to
say
--
mr.
r.
a.
eilbott,
jr.
that
would
be
just
like
throwing
us
back
to
the
lines
from
which
we
came.
somewhere
along
this
line,
surely,
we
have
a
right
to
be
heard
by
judiciary.
we
went
through
all
of
the
departments
--
mr.
r.
a.
eilbott,
jr.
i
am
entitled
to
a
relief
--
mr.
r.
a.
eilbott,
jr.
no
sir.
if
it
please
your
honor,
mr.
justice
marshall,
there
is
plenty
that
has
already
been
done.
number
one,
we
have
been
dragged
through
the
mud
and
mire.
number
two,
there
is
a
cease
and
desist
order
that
we
do
not
appeal
from.
if
we
violate
that
cease
and
desist
order,
i
am
sure
your
honor
knows
that
the
penalties
are
rather
severe.
what
we
are
fighting
and
all
we
are
fighting
is
what
the
eight
circuit
court
of
appeals
said
was
unconscionable,
and
that's
a
30-day
suspension.
there
is
plenty
of
teeth
in
what
they
have
done
to
us
besides
the
30-day
suspension,
they
didn't
need
that
to
add
to
our
woes,
that
is
our
point,
because
with
the
finding
of
that
30-day
suspension,
on
the
basis
of
the
cases
before
us,
they
have
found
that
we
intentionally
violated
the
act,
and
we'll
deny
that
until
the
day
we
die.
those
are
our
sentiments
in
--
mr.
r.
a.
eilbott,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
r.
a.
eilbott,
jr.
that's
correct.
without
giving
a
reason,
and
he
gave
no
reason
here.
mr.
r.
a.
eilbott,
jr.
yes
sir,
and
his
own
judicial
review
officer
reduced
it
to
10
days.
mr.
r.
a.
eilbott,
jr.
then
it's
discrimination,
unless
he
gives
a
reason
why
we
should
be
discriminated
again.
mr.
r.
a.
eilbott,
jr.
yes
sir,
yes
sir.
i
will
go
a
little
further
in
--
mr.
r.
a.
eilbott,
jr.
what
he
didn't
start
before
he
got
to
us?
mr.
r.
a.
eilbott,
jr.
well,
he
may
have
changed
his
mind,
then
he
should
have
given
us
a
reason
why
we
out
of
all
of
the
world
should
be
signaled
out.
the
record
will
show
in
this
case
that
of
the
50
stockyards
in
the
state
of
arkansas,
only
one
was
examined
in
12
months,
and
that
was
us.
now,
is
there
a
reason
for
that
too?
mr.
r.
a.
eilbott,
jr.
i
know
that's
not
the
issue,
but
that's
all
part
of
the
background.
mr.
r.
a.
eilbott,
jr.
yes,
it
is.
i
can
quote
it
to
you
verbatim
from
mr.
qursbanksi's
(ph)
questioning.
mr.
r.
a.
eilbott,
jr.
no,
but
i
can
say
to
you,
i
ask
--
i
asked
prezel
(ph),
one
of
the
two
government
witnesses
whether
or
not
he
had
any
proof
whatsoever
that
we
intentionally
violated
this
act,
and
he
said
no.
mr.
r.
a.
eilbott,
jr.
what
i
understand
willful
means
could
be
flagrant
negligence,
but
that's
far
different
from
intentional.
mr.
r.
a.
eilbott,
jr.
yes
sir.
it
does
not
mean
that
we
intentionally
back
weighed
--
mr.
r.
a.
eilbott,
jr.
that's
correct.
mr.
r.
a.
eilbott,
jr.
we
were
careless,
but
we
also,
when
we
were
careless,
we
took
every
step
we
knew
to
find
out
what
was
wrong.
we
had
the
government’s
own
scale
weigher
to
weight
the
scales,
to
check
them.
mr.
r.
a.
eilbott,
jr.
the
eight
circuit
found
we
were
careless,
but
the
eight
circuit
refused
to
find
that
we
intentionally
did
what
we
did,
and
the
eight
circuit
pointed
out
that
the
secretary
had
held
that
uniformity
was
a
situation.
mr.
r.
a.
eilbott,
jr.
unless
--
mr.
r.
a.
eilbott,
jr.
unless
he
gives
adequate
reason,
according
to
his
own
opinions.
mr.
r.
a.
eilbott,
jr.
yes
sir,
but
if
he
puts
him
only
with
the
negligent
violator,
then
it's
my
position
that
the
department
of
agriculture
or
the
secretary
must
show
a
reason
for
doing
that,
otherwise
all
others
who
have
been
found
guilty
only
of
negligence,
there
has
been
nothing,
but
a
cease
and
desist
order,
why
suddenly
us?
mr.
r.
a.
eilbott,
jr.
and
if
he
was
going
to
make
--
pardon,
may
i
finish?
mr.
r.
a.
eilbott,
jr.
if
he
was
going
to
make
a
new
rule,
then
why
didn't
he
say
so?
mr.
r.
a.
eilbott,
jr.
now,
mr.
chief
justice
--
mr.
r.
a.
eilbott,
jr.
well
--
mr.
r.
a.
eilbott,
jr.
you
are
getting
down
on
my
level
now
mr.
chief
justice.
i
know
that
the
judge
would
lean
back
in
his
chair
and
say,
mr.
eilbott,
i
am
tired
of
this.
i
am
tired
of
this
continuing
mounting
of
this
type
of
offense
and
that
type
of
offense
and
i
am
going
to
put
a
stop
to
it.
mr.
r.
a.
eilbott,
jr.
i
don't
think
he'd
ever
do
it.
that's
my
--
mr.
r.
a.
eilbott,
jr.
then
assuming
he
did,
if
it
was
within
his
power,
he
had
that
right,
but
it
would
certainly
be
discriminatory
against
the
first
man
he
did
it
to,
mr.
marshall.
mr.
r.
a.
eilbott,
jr.
sir?
mr.
r.
a.
eilbott,
jr.
no.
if
he
had
announced
the
caveat,
then
yes,
i
would
say
he
had
the
power.
i
would
--
mr.
r.
a.
eilbott,
jr.
if
he
had
announced
the
caveat,
then
i
would
say
it
was
not
discrimination,
but
i
say
in
all
fairness
that
when
you,
out
of
a
great
line
of
cases,
none
of
which
have
ever
imposed
a
suspension
unless
there
be
found
an
intentional
violation,
then
suddenly
you
do
that,
you
are
saying
to
me
and
to
my
clients,
you
are
a
bunch
of
crooks.
mr.
r.
a.
eilbott,
jr.
not
if
i
had
been
told
why
and
it
had
been
told
to
me,
it
wouldn't
be
a
first
impression.
mr.
r.
a.
eilbott,
jr.
yes.
mr.
r.
a.
eilbott,
jr.
but
mr.
justice
white,
my
position
simply
is
--
mr.
r.
a.
eilbott,
jr.
the
eight
circuit
didn't
say
it
was
unjustified,
they
found
it
unconscionable.
how
stronger
can
you
get
then
that?
they
found
that
the
punishment
meted
out
heretofore
was
ample
to
cover
the
proof.
now,
that's
what
they
found.
mr.
r.
a.
eilbott,
jr.
yes,
that
is.
but
the
question
is
also
in
this
case
that
the
secretary
set
out
the
original
rule
that
it
must
be
uniform.
and
if
he
is
going
to
depart
from
those
findings,
then
he
should
say,
now
gentlemen,
this
is
where
we
get
off.
this
is
the
first
case,
but
we
are
going
to
depart
from
our
rule
for
these
reasons.
they
shouldn't
just
single
one
out
without
any
warning
whatsoever
and
say,
you
little
bitty
outfit
down
there
in
arkansas,
now
we've
had
packers,
we've
had
stockyards,
we've
had
by
the
thousands,
but
now
we're
going
to
start
with
you,
but
didn't
say
it.
mr.
r.
a.
eilbott,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
i
do
not
propose
to
deal
in
levity
with
you,
but
it
would
have
been
easier
if
they
just
chopped
off
one
of
our
hands,
then
maybe
it
might
have
been
a
better
lesson.
mr.
r.
a.
eilbott,
jr.
i
don't
think
it's
had
any
effect
on
anybody
besides
glover
livestock,
and
that's
the
only
one
that
has
ever
been
inspected
as
far
as
i
know
in
the
state
of
arkansas;
it
certainly
was
up
to
the
day
we
were
inspected.
i
think
there
is
a
little
more
here
than
is
in
the
record,
if
you
want
to
know
what
i
think,
but
i
have
no
proof
of
that
your
honor.
thank
you
for
your
kindness.
thank
you
gentlemen.
mr.
r.
a.
eilbott,
jr.
can
i
have
one
minute
of
what
you
have.[laughter]
mr.
r.
a.
eilbott,
jr.
thank
you.
thank
you
for
you
kindness
in
hearing
us
sir.
mr.
r.
a.
eilbott,
jr.
(voice
overlap)
from
the
court.
mr.
r.
a.
eilbott,
jr.
thank
you.
mr.
r.
a.
eilbott,
jr.
may
it
please
--
mr.
r.
a.
eilbott,
jr.
--
the
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
your
honors,
gentlemen
of
the
court.
i
think
we
came
here
or
i
thought
i
did
to
argue
some
degree
of
law,
but
there
have
been
so
many
statements
affect
given,
which
i
do
not
agree
with,
and
which
can
only
be
thought
of
as
prejudicial
to
my
clients,
but
i
think
i
should
answer
just
a
few
of
those
before
i
go
into
what
i
had
intended
to
say
to
this
court.
now,
number
one,
we
have
the
statement
by
mr.
jones
and
may
i
say
to
your
honors
before
i
go
further
that
i
am
a
small
country
town
lawyer.
mr.
jones
has
been
most
cooperative
to
us
and
most
kind
to
us
in
the
preparation
of
our
appearances
before
your
honors,
because
i
have
never
had
that
privilege
before,
except
when
i
was
admitted.
mr.
r.
a.
eilbott,
jr.
well,
that's
what
i
hope
to
do
to
mr.
jones.
mr.
r.
a.
eilbott,
jr.
yes
sir.[laughter]
that's
exactly
what
i
intend
to
do
or
if
i
can.
mr.
r.
a.
eilbott,
jr.
i
wish
i
had
one
law
book
your
honor.[laughter]
he
first
makes
mention
however
that
we
had
been
told
four
times.
now,
if
it
please
your
honors,
let
me
get
one
thing
straight,
because
i
have
now
lived
with
this
case
for
three-and-a-half
years.
we
did
receive
three
letters
on
the
question
of
weighing,
and
the
record
shows
that
in
each
and
every
instance
we
immediately
had
weighed
scale
testers
in
to
determine
what
the
condition
was
of
our
scales
and
unfortunately,
we
got
no
answers
on
those
first
three
occasions.
we
would
urge
your
honors
that
in
--
and
the
transcripts
so
shows
that
this
was
found
to
be
true,
that
if
you
weighed
these
scales
as
was
required
by
the
government,
that
is
put
a
weight
on
each
corner
and
weighed
it,
they
found
nothing
wrong
with
our
scales.
and
indeed,
nothing
was
found
wrong
with
these
scales
until,
at
my
repeated
urging,
they
brought
in
a
gentleman
from
memphis
who
had
been
selling
scales
and
had
been
using
scales,
fairbanks-morse
scales
for
20
some
odd
years,
he
testified,
it's
part
of
the
record.
he
showed
that
those
scales
had
enough
wear
and
tear
that
when
a
cattle
rushed
on
to
the
scale,
not
withstanding
the
scales
would
prove
correct
at
a
dead
weight,
but
when
you
prodded
one
on
with
an
electric
prod,
which
is
a
system,
that
when
it
hit
the
metal
of
that
scale,
there
was
going
to
be
some
variant
sometimes.
now,
sometimes
the
scales
would
rare
--
would
weigh
accurately,
other
times,
they
would
not.
mr.
r.
a.
eilbott,
jr.
that
is
correct,
your
honor,
he
certainly
did
justice
marshall.
now,
when
we
come
down
to
the
question
here
of
how
many
--
mr.
r.
a.
eilbott,
jr.
yes
sir.[luncheon
recess]
mr.
r.
a.
eilbott,
jr.
may
it
please
the
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
truthfully
gentlemen,
when
we
get
through
sparring
and
there
are
several
things
that
i
would
like
to
answer
from
the
solicitor
general,
we're
here
on
the
matter
of
a
20-day
suspension.
we
could
have,
if
it
please
your
honors,
and
the
court
record
will
show,
we
could
have
taken
the
30-day
suspension
the
day
they
filed
the
complaint,
or
in
plain
language,
we
could
have
taken
our
medicine
for
30
days
and
that
would
have
been
all
there
had
been
to
it,
it
would
all
have
been
over.
mr.
r.
a.
eilbott,
jr.
your
honor,
that's
about
three
working
days.
the
government
is
correct
on
that,
but
they
have
no
more
conception
of
what
those
three
working
days
are
to
us,
to
anything
in
this
world.
what
those
three
working
days
amount
to,
i
think
chief
--
mr.
justice
leah
in
the
eight
circuit
court
of
appeals
very
aptly
put
it.
they
amount
to
calling
us
crooks,
and
we
are
not
crooks
and
that's
what
we
stand
before
this
court
on
today.
we
did
not
intentionally
violate
any
regulation.
we
did
not
intentionally,
if
it
please
your
honor,
deliberately
underweigh
our
overweigh
cattle.
in
the
first
place,
the
government
says
that
we
were
warned
four
times,
and
each
of
those
instances
--
three
times,
and
in
each
of
those
instances,
we
had
the
government’s
own
weighing
team
to
check
our
scales,
and
they
couldn't
report
anything
wrong
to
us
because
there
they
used
the
four
edges
of
balance.
that's
what
the
record
shows.
it
was
only
when
we
tore
those
scales
down
that
we
found
out
what
was
wrong
with
the
scales,
or
what
could
have
been
wrong
with
the
scales.
now,
the
government
says,
that
was
not
mentioned
by
the
eight
circuit
court
of
appeals,
but
indeed,
if
it
please
your
honors,
it
was
mentioned
not
once
but
twice
in
their
opinion,
and
if
your
honors
look
at
the
appendix
that
is
on
page
16
and
19,
the
eight
circuit
--
mr.
r.
a.
eilbott,
jr.
well
then
--
mr.
r.
a.
eilbott,
jr.
well
--
mr.
r.
a.
eilbott,
jr.
if
your
honor
would
look
at
appendix
a
to
the
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari,
on
page
16,
you
would
find
glover
is
an
operator
of
a
posted
stockyard
in
pine
bluff,
arkansas,
registered
so
forth,
to
sell
livestock,
honored
by
june
2,
1964,
july
26,
1966,
and
june
20,
1967,
representatives
of
the
usda
conducted
investigations
of
so
forth
and
so
on,
and
it
goes
on.
then
on
page
19,
it
also
points
out
in
another
place
that
these
matters
where
brought
to
the
attention
of
the
eight
circuit
court
of
appeals,
and
they
mentioned
them
in
their
finding
and
in
their
decree.
we
would
respectfully
point
out
also
that
in
three
of
those
instances,
there
was
no
evidence
taken,
nothing,
other
than
to
say
you're
not
weighing
properly,
and
we
called
in
a
scale
examiner,
one
who
was
approved
by
the
federal
government.
they
could
give
us
no
answers.
the
agricultural
department
made
no
effort
to
give
us
any
answers.
so
consequently,
when
it
came
to
the
eight
circuit
court
of
appeals,
we
have
had
a
situation
where
the
eight
circuit
court
of
appeals
found
specifically
that
it
was
not
an
intentional
and
flagrant
violation,
and
that
also
is
in
the
eight
circuit
court
of
appeals
opinion,
if
it
please
your
honor,
it's
on
page
9
of
our
brief,
but
i
am
sure
it's
in
the
appendix.
i
didn't
go
to
that
trouble
to
find
it
out,
but
most
assuredly,
they
found
no
intentional
violation.
we
have
had
a
situation
that
i
would
like
to
bring
to
the
attention
of
this
court.
the
word
unconscionable
has
come
in,
and
mr.
jones
states
the
really
the
eight
circuit
didn't
give
any
reason
for
that
word,
but
gentlemen,
they
did.
they
most
assuredly
did,
in
the
last
paragraph
of
their
opinion.
they
pointed
out
exactly
why
they
thought
it
was
unconscionable.
i
don't
think
there
is
any
doubt
about
it.
they
found
out
that
these
press
releases
which
mr.
jones
a
few
moments
ago
says,
i've
forgotten
what
he
called
them,
routine
press
releases
i
believe,
well,
we're
in
the
unenviable
position
that
we
found
out
we
had
been
charged
with
an
offense
in
the
newspaper.
everything
that
was
done
in
this
case
was
in
the
newspaper.
routine
press
releases,
if
they
be
routine,
they
damaged
us,
they
damaged
us
to
the
point
that
truthfully
and
honestly,
if
it
wasn't
at
my
own
insistence,
we
wouldn't
be
here
today
because
we're
not
financially
able
to
be
here,
but
we're
here.
we're
still
saying
we
didn't
intentionally
do
anything.
we
didn't
intentionally
do
it
and
we're
not
crooks.
that's
what
it
amounts
to.
now
they
say
we
short-weighed
cattle.
there
were
29
drafts,
i
believe
it
was
proven
to
have
been
weighed,
whether
or
not
those
cattle
had
any
access
to
water,
which
would
have
caused
them
to
gain
weight
or
not,
i
am
not
in
the
position
to
say,
but
if
it
please
you
justices,
neither
was
the
government,
because
they
weren't
there
either.
i
know
one
thing,
of
the
29
drafts
weighed,
nine
were
underweighed,
nine
were
overweighed,
and
the
rest
were
right
on
the
spot,
and
i
want
to
say
to
you
that
of
the
nine
underweighed,
two
of
them,
two
out
of
the
nine
belonged
to
one
of
my
clients,
who
is
selling
his
own
cattle
to
the
livestock
commission
agency.
in
other
words,
if
anybody
got
cheated
on
those
two,
it
was
thomas
glover
who
owns
part
of
glover
livestock
commission
agency.
now,
that
doesn't
make
sense
to
me
that
we
would
intentionally
cheat
ourselves.
now,
the
government
has
used
the
argument
that
i
have
heard
since
the
first
day
we
heard
this
before
a
hearing
examiner,
and
let
me
digress
just
one
minute
and
say
that
the
way
we
heard
this
matter
is
simply
this.
the
government
through
the
agricultural
department
charges
us
with
an
offense.
that's
heard
before
a
hearing
examiner
who
is
an
employee
of
the
agricultural
department.
that's
heard
with
two
witnesses
from
the
agricultural
department.
that's
heard
with
prosecutors,
two
of
them
from
the
agricultural
department,
and
from
that
we
had
an
appeal
to
a
judicial
review
officer
who
also
is
an
employee
of
the
agricultural
department.
and
that
was
what
we
got
in
the
way
of
a
hearing
until
we
got
to
the
eight
circuit
court
of
appeals,
and
i
would
be
the
first
to
admit
that
they
do
have
somewhat
limited
powers
of
review,
but
congress
never
intended
that
the
judiciary
abrogate
all
of
its
powers
to
the
regulatory
commissions.
certainly,
if
it
did,
it
should
have
said
so.
we
have
been
told
here
that
--
the
reason
that
we
did
this,
the
reason
we
short-weighed
was
because
if
we
short-weighed
them
when
we
weighed
the
cattle,
then
the
buyer
got
more
than
he
paid
for
and
he
was
happy.
i
have
heard
that
now
for
three-and-a-half
years,
but
that
isn't
the
truth
either,
and
i
don't
mean
to
imply
that
anyone
is
fibbing.
i
mean
to
say
that's
a
matter
of
philosophy.
the
truth
about
the
matter
is,
in
the
conduct
of
livestock
commission
agents,
whoever
has
got
the
cattle
to
sell,
the
buyers
will
come.
you
don't
need
to
worry
about
getting
buyers
if
you
can
get
the
farmer
to
bring
you
the
cattle.
we
don't
have
to
underweigh
the
farmer’s
cattle
and
give
armor
a
little
excess,
10
or
15
pounds.
mr.
r.
a.
eilbott,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
--
mr.
r.
a.
eilbott,
jr.
excuse
me
sir.
mr.
r.
a.
eilbott,
jr.
yes
sir,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
that
was
what
i
was
prepared
to
argue
until
i
came
this
morning,
and
i
found
that
it
was
stated
that
the
court
of
appeals
had
not
considered
this,
that,
and
the
other,
and
i
knew
the
court
of
appeals
had,
because
it
was
in
their
opinion.
i
will
gladly
move
along
into
what
we
are
really
here
for.
the
appellee
here
concedes
that
the
judicial
review
by
the
eight
circuit
court
of
appeals;
whether
it
be
good
law
or
bad
law,
is
a
limited
review,
but
we
say
to
you,
in
all
sincerity,
that
there
has
been
absolutely
no
proof
and
the
eight
circuit
court
of
appeals
so
found
that
there
was
any
intentional
violation
of
the
statute
or
the
regulation.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
there
is
none.
we
have
asked
the
department
of
agriculture,
we
have
requested
of
the
solicitor
general
that
they
show
us
one
case
in
which
the
department,
without
a
finding
of
intentional,
can
say
that
a
suspension
is
in
order.
we
didn't
place
into
the
law
the
requirement
that
these
orders
be
uniform.
indeed,
this
court
did
not
place
that
into
the
law.
the
secretary
of
agriculture
himself
said
that
the
findings
of
the
department
of
agriculture
should
be
uniform,
because
otherwise
they
would
be
discriminatory.
and
that
is
in
the
much
cited
case
of
royce
versus
–
doing
business
with
madison
stockyard,
which
is
a
department
of
agriculture
case.
we
are
here
saying
merely
one
thing.
the
department
of
agriculture
may
have
found
that
there
was
a
proper
reason
for
suspension
of
our
license
for
20
days,
but
if
they
did,
they
didn't
set
it
out
in
their
opinion
and
neither
did
the
eight
circuit
court
of
appeals.
yet
as
the
eight
circuit
said
and
as
the
department
of
agriculture
has
said,
these
rulings
must
be
uniform.
mr.
jones
mentioned
a
150
cases,
but
those
were
not
cases,
that
was
a
mere
citation
at
the
bottom
of
a
page
that
merely
mentioned
rulings
of
the
department;
whether
they
were
consent
cases,
those
in
which
a
person
had
consented
to
be
suspended,
which
most
of
these
cases
end
up
being,
or
whether
they
where
actually
tried,
or
whether
they
were
entered
on
an
original
order.
mr.
r.
a.
eilbott,
jr.
your
honor,
we
find
no
case,
and
we
have
asked
the
department
to
show
us
a
case
in
which
it
has
been
tried
or
otherwise
where
they
have
made
a
finding
that
--
had
not
made
a
finding
that
it
was
intentional
and
suspended
of
business,
not
a
one
and
i
say
to
you
today,
standing
in
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states,
we
have
not
found
a
single
case.
absence,
the
finding
of
intentional
violation
that
a
suspension
order
has
been
issued
by
the
secretary
of
agriculture
up
to
the
day
he
issued
our
order
and--
mr.
r.
a.
eilbott,
jr.
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
r.
a.
eilbott,
jr.
i
don't
think
there
was
evidence
there
justice
marshall
to
support
such
a
finding.
may
i
quote
one
--
mr.
r.
a.
eilbott,
jr.
yes
sir,
and
if
they
did,
i
think
they
could,
yes.
and
if
they
did
--
mr.
r.
a.
eilbott,
jr.
they
may
have
taken
it
over
only
because
they
found
--
mr.
r.
a.
eilbott,
jr.
i
think
they
do,
unless
you
would
read
the
stockyard
and
packers
act
as
a
complete
abrogation
of
judicial
review.
mr.
r.
a.
eilbott,
jr.
i
understand
that.
mr.
r.
a.
eilbott,
jr.
what
makes
it
--
mr.
r.
a.
eilbott,
jr.
i
think
the
eight
circuit
could
have
sent
it
back,
but
they
chose
to
say
--
mr.
r.
a.
eilbott,
jr.
that
would
be
just
like
throwing
us
back
to
the
lines
from
which
we
came.
somewhere
along
this
line,
surely,
we
have
a
right
to
be
heard
by
judiciary.
we
went
through
all
of
the
departments
--
mr.
r.
a.
eilbott,
jr.
i
am
entitled
to
a
relief
--
mr.
r.
a.
eilbott,
jr.
no
sir.
if
it
please
your
honor,
mr.
justice
marshall,
there
is
plenty
that
has
already
been
done.
number
one,
we
have
been
dragged
through
the
mud
and
mire.
number
two,
there
is
a
cease
and
desist
order
that
we
do
not
appeal
from.
if
we
violate
that
cease
and
desist
order,
i
am
sure
your
honor
knows
that
the
penalties
are
rather
severe.
what
we
are
fighting
and
all
we
are
fighting
is
what
the
eight
circuit
court
of
appeals
said
was
unconscionable,
and
that's
a
30-day
suspension.
there
is
plenty
of
teeth
in
what
they
have
done
to
us
besides
the
30-day
suspension,
they
didn't
need
that
to
add
to
our
woes,
that
is
our
point,
because
with
the
finding
of
that
30-day
suspension,
on
the
basis
of
the
cases
before
us,
they
have
found
that
we
intentionally
violated
the
act,
and
we'll
deny
that
until
the
day
we
die.
those
are
our
sentiments
in
--
mr.
r.
a.
eilbott,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
r.
a.
eilbott,
jr.
that's
correct.
without
giving
a
reason,
and
he
gave
no
reason
here.
mr.
r.
a.
eilbott,
jr.
yes
sir,
and
his
own
judicial
review
officer
reduced
it
to
10
days.
mr.
r.
a.
eilbott,
jr.
then
it's
discrimination,
unless
he
gives
a
reason
why
we
should
be
discriminated
again.
mr.
r.
a.
eilbott,
jr.
yes
sir,
yes
sir.
i
will
go
a
little
further
in
--
mr.
r.
a.
eilbott,
jr.
what
he
didn't
start
before
he
got
to
us?
mr.
r.
a.
eilbott,
jr.
well,
he
may
have
changed
his
mind,
then
he
should
have
given
us
a
reason
why
we
out
of
all
of
the
world
should
be
signaled
out.
the
record
will
show
in
this
case
that
of
the
50
stockyards
in
the
state
of
arkansas,
only
one
was
examined
in
12
months,
and
that
was
us.
now,
is
there
a
reason
for
that
too?
mr.
r.
a.
eilbott,
jr.
i
know
that's
not
the
issue,
but
that's
all
part
of
the
background.
mr.
r.
a.
eilbott,
jr.
yes,
it
is.
i
can
quote
it
to
you
verbatim
from
mr.
qursbanksi's
(ph)
questioning.
mr.
r.
a.
eilbott,
jr.
no,
but
i
can
say
to
you,
i
ask
--
i
asked
prezel
(ph),
one
of
the
two
government
witnesses
whether
or
not
he
had
any
proof
whatsoever
that
we
intentionally
violated
this
act,
and
he
said
no.
mr.
r.
a.
eilbott,
jr.
what
i
understand
willful
means
could
be
flagrant
negligence,
but
that's
far
different
from
intentional.
mr.
r.
a.
eilbott,
jr.
yes
sir.
it
does
not
mean
that
we
intentionally
back
weighed
--
mr.
r.
a.
eilbott,
jr.
that's
correct.
mr.
r.
a.
eilbott,
jr.
we
were
careless,
but
we
also,
when
we
were
careless,
we
took
every
step
we
knew
to
find
out
what
was
wrong.
we
had
the
government’s
own
scale
weigher
to
weight
the
scales,
to
check
them.
mr.
r.
a.
eilbott,
jr.
the
eight
circuit
found
we
were
careless,
but
the
eight
circuit
refused
to
find
that
we
intentionally
did
what
we
did,
and
the
eight
circuit
pointed
out
that
the
secretary
had
held
that
uniformity
was
a
situation.
mr.
r.
a.
eilbott,
jr.
unless
--
mr.
r.
a.
eilbott,
jr.
unless
he
gives
adequate
reason,
according
to
his
own
opinions.
mr.
r.
a.
eilbott,
jr.
yes
sir,
but
if
he
puts
him
only
with
the
negligent
violator,
then
it's
my
position
that
the
department
of
agriculture
or
the
secretary
must
show
a
reason
for
doing
that,
otherwise
all
others
who
have
been
found
guilty
only
of
negligence,
there
has
been
nothing,
but
a
cease
and
desist
order,
why
suddenly
us?
mr.
r.
a.
eilbott,
jr.
and
if
he
was
going
to
make
--
pardon,
may
i
finish?
mr.
r.
a.
eilbott,
jr.
if
he
was
going
to
make
a
new
rule,
then
why
didn't
he
say
so?
mr.
r.
a.
eilbott,
jr.
now,
mr.
chief
justice
--
mr.
r.
a.
eilbott,
jr.
well
--
mr.
r.
a.
eilbott,
jr.
you
are
getting
down
on
my
level
now
mr.
chief
justice.
i
know
that
the
judge
would
lean
back
in
his
chair
and
say,
mr.
eilbott,
i
am
tired
of
this.
i
am
tired
of
this
continuing
mounting
of
this
type
of
offense
and
that
type
of
offense
and
i
am
going
to
put
a
stop
to
it.
mr.
r.
a.
eilbott,
jr.
i
don't
think
he'd
ever
do
it.
that's
my
--
mr.
r.
a.
eilbott,
jr.
then
assuming
he
did,
if
it
was
within
his
power,
he
had
that
right,
but
it
would
certainly
be
discriminatory
against
the
first
man
he
did
it
to,
mr.
marshall.
mr.
r.
a.
eilbott,
jr.
sir?
mr.
r.
a.
eilbott,
jr.
no.
if
he
had
announced
the
caveat,
then
yes,
i
would
say
he
had
the
power.
i
would
--
mr.
r.
a.
eilbott,
jr.
if
he
had
announced
the
caveat,
then
i
would
say
it
was
not
discrimination,
but
i
say
in
all
fairness
that
when
you,
out
of
a
great
line
of
cases,
none
of
which
have
ever
imposed
a
suspension
unless
there
be
found
an
intentional
violation,
then
suddenly
you
do
that,
you
are
saying
to
me
and
to
my
clients,
you
are
a
bunch
of
crooks.
mr.
r.
a.
eilbott,
jr.
not
if
i
had
been
told
why
and
it
had
been
told
to
me,
it
wouldn't
be
a
first
impression.
mr.
r.
a.
eilbott,
jr.
yes.
mr.
r.
a.
eilbott,
jr.
but
mr.
justice
white,
my
position
simply
is
--
mr.
r.
a.
eilbott,
jr.
the
eight
circuit
didn't
say
it
was
unjustified,
they
found
it
unconscionable.
how
stronger
can
you
get
then
that?
they
found
that
the
punishment
meted
out
heretofore
was
ample
to
cover
the
proof.
now,
that's
what
they
found.
mr.
r.
a.
eilbott,
jr.
yes,
that
is.
but
the
question
is
also
in
this
case
that
the
secretary
set
out
the
original
rule
that
it
must
be
uniform.
and
if
he
is
going
to
depart
from
those
findings,
then
he
should
say,
now
gentlemen,
this
is
where
we
get
off.
this
is
the
first
case,
but
we
are
going
to
depart
from
our
rule
for
these
reasons.
they
shouldn't
just
single
one
out
without
any
warning
whatsoever
and
say,
you
little
bitty
outfit
down
there
in
arkansas,
now
we've
had
packers,
we've
had
stockyards,
we've
had
by
the
thousands,
but
now
we're
going
to
start
with
you,
but
didn't
say
it.
mr.
r.
a.
eilbott,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
i
do
not
propose
to
deal
in
levity
with
you,
but
it
would
have
been
easier
if
they
just
chopped
off
one
of
our
hands,
then
maybe
it
might
have
been
a
better
lesson.
mr.
r.
a.
eilbott,
jr.
i
don't
think
it's
had
any
effect
on
anybody
besides
glover
livestock,
and
that's
the
only
one
that
has
ever
been
inspected
as
far
as
i
know
in
the
state
of
arkansas;
it
certainly
was
up
to
the
day
we
were
inspected.
i
think
there
is
a
little
more
here
than
is
in
the
record,
if
you
want
to
know
what
i
think,
but
i
have
no
proof
of
that
your
honor.
thank
you
for
your
kindness.
thank
you
gentlemen.
mr.
r.
a.
eilbott,
jr.
can
i
have
one
minute
of
what
you
have.[laughter]
mr.
r.
a.
eilbott,
jr.
thank
you.
thank
you
for
you
kindness
in
hearing
us
sir.
mr.
r.
a.
eilbott,
jr.
(voice
overlap)
from
the
court.
mr.
r.
a.
eilbott,
jr.
thank
you.
