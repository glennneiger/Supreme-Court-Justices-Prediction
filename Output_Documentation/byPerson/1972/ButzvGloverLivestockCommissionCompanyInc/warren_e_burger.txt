we'll
hear
arguments
next
in
71-1545,
butz
against
glover
livestock
commission.
mr.
jones,
you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
as
a
matter
of
fact,
did
we
limit
the
grant
here
only
to
the
remedy?
is
this
a
limited
grant
of
the
writ,
do
you
recall?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
there
really
is
only
one
issue
in
the
case?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now,
it
seems
to
me
in
your
brief
mr.
jones,
you
emphasized
that
there
had
been
prior
violations
and
that
there
had
been
three
or
four
occasions
when
the
authorities
of
secretary
staff
warned
glover
about
violations.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
don't
find
that
the
court
of
appeals
made
any
mention
of
that
or
perhaps
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
eilbott.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
small
town
lawyer,
counsel,
is
like
a
lawyer
who
walks
into
the
courtroom
with
just
one
law
book,
and
that's
the
fellow
that
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
will
resume
there
after
lunch,
counsel.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
counsel,
you
may
continue.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
how
many
working
days,
business
days
would
that
actually
be?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
think
it
wasn't
the
solicitor
general,
it
was
my
suggestion.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
inquiry,
i
said
i
couldn't
find
it
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
reading
it
on
the
bench.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
eilbott,
you
were
--
at
least
as
i
follow
your
argument,
you
are
arguing
and
rearguing
an
element
on
which
the
court
of
appeals
has
found
against
you,
and
you
have
--
you
have
no
cross
appeal
here.
for
example,
on
page
19
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
let
me
read
this
first.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
all
evidence
considered
the
hearing
examiner
crediting
the
evidence
that
the
cattle
reweighed
had
no
access
to
food
and
water
could
properly
conclude
that
they
had
been
underweighed
by
glover,
and
now
that's
just
one
of
several
items.
the
only
thing
in
the
case
here
on,
at
least
so
i
had
thought,
was
the
appropriateness
of
the
court
of
appeals
modifying
the
penalty,
not
the
fact
findings?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
difference,
i
wonder,
would
it
make
whether
they
were
tried
actually,
tried
out
on
a
contested
basis
or
whether
they
in
fact
entered
a
guilty
plea
in
terms
of
the
penalty?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
on
that
score
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
fine,
you
finish.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
alright,
on
that
point,
it's
a
common
occurrence
in
traffic
courts,
for
example,
where
the
traffic
judge
is
confronted
with
hundreds
and
hundreds
of
cases,
sees
a
mounting
epidemic
almost
of
either
drunken
driving
or
speeding
or
some
such
thing,
and
finally,
the
last
straw
comes,
and
on
that
day
he
starts
imposing
more
severe
sentences
to
make
an
example
out
of
either
a
drunk
driver
or
a
speeder
or
what
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now,
do
you
think
the
judge;
that's
what
you
have
here
must
make
some
explanation
that
this
situation
is
getting
so
severe
that
i
am
tired
of
this
underweighing
and
we
are
going
to
make
an
example
out
of
glover?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
think
he
is
going
to
articulate
that?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
let's
assume
he
didn't
though,
that's
the
assumption,
let's
assume
he
just
did
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
they
do
it
quite
regularly.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
the
question
in
the
case
is
whether
congress
gave
them
that
power
really,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
would
it
be
fair
to
assume
that
since
you
indicate
they
were
news
releases,
the
word
has
gotten
around
in
the
industry,
among
the
dealers,
would
it
be
fair
to
assume
that
perhaps
they're
being
a
little
more
careful
after
the
experience
of
glover
and
the
litigation
that's
ensued?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
i
am
speaking
of
others.
do
you
think
it
has
made
other
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
eilbott.
mr.
jones,
do
you
have
anything
further?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
a
little
--
give
us
a
little
time
to
find
that
would
you
mr.
jones.

the

no,

don't
permit
a

counsel.
