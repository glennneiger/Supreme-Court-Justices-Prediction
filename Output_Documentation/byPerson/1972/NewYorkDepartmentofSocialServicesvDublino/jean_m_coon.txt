ms.
jean
m.
coon
thank
you.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
in
directing
argument
on
the
merits
in
this
case,
this
court
postponed
the
question
of
jurisdiction,
that
issue
has
been
briefed
by
both
appellants
and
i
wish
to
comment
only
briefly
on
jurisdiction.
the
complaint
in
the
instant
case
attack
new
york’s
work
referrals
statutes
claiming
that
they
conflict
not
only
with
the
provisions
of
the
federal
social
security
act,
but
also
that
they
violated
both
the
thirteenth
and
fourteenth
amendments
of
the
constitution
in
the
united
states.
those
latter
issues
were
extensively
briefed
and
argued
by
all
parties.
the
district
court
in
its
decision
rejected
the
thirteenth
and
fourteenth
amendment
claims,
but
did
discuss
them
at
length
and
did
consider
them
substantial
constitutional
questions.
even
though
it
eventually
found
they’re
not
to
be
sustained
on
the
law.
it
is
our
understanding
of
the
decisions
of
this
court
that
as
long
as
the
constitutional
questions
raised
are
substantial
a
statutory
three-judge
court
is
properly
convene
and
consequently
in
appeal
directly
to
this
court
is
also
proper.
even
though
the
district
court
ultimately
rejects
claim
constitutional
invalidity.
we
might
also
observe
that
if
this
is
not
the
case,
then
this
court
should
consider
whether
as
held
by
the
second
circuit
hagans
case
cited
in
the
appellants’
briefs.
there
was
substantial
federal
question
at
all
present
in
the
case,
efficient
to
confer
jurisdiction
even
upon
a
single
district
judge.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
oh!
yes,
your
honor.
that’s
--
that’s
entirely
--
that’s
entirely
true,
but
we
are
also
suggesting
this
court
the
possibility
that
the
court
may
adopt
the
hagans
case
rule
in
the
second
circuit
that
if
the
question
is
found
not
to
be
substantial,
federal
constitutional
question
at
all
that
it’s
a
matter
for
the
state
courts
and
not
for
the
federal
courts
to
determine.
our
main
argument
is
of
course
address
to
the
merits
of
the
state
statutes
here
at
issue.
briefly,
the
statutes
at
the
time
of
the
commencement
of
the
action
provided
that
all
social
services
recipients
in
the
aid
for
dependent
children
and
then
the
totally,
also
the
totally
state-funded
home
relief
categories,
must
if
employable
register
with
the
state
department
--
or
state
employment
service
of
the
state
department
of
labor
report
semi-monthly
to
that
office
for
job
referral
and
to
pick
up
welfare
checks
and
to
accept
employment
when
offered
and
further
provided
for
public
works
project
employment
for
persons
not
placed
in
private
employment.
the
work
referral
statute
also
provides
a
definition
of
those
who
would
be
considered
unemployable.
the
aged,
the
sick
and
disabled,
children
in
school,
vocational
trainees
and
mothers
whose
presence
was
needed
on
the
home
for
care
for
children
or
those
mothers
for
whom
daycare
services
were
not
available.
subsequent
to
the
commencement
of
this
action,
the
referral
statute
was
amendment
to
provide
that
the
original
definition
of
employability
would
apply
only
to
the
home
relief
recipients
and
that
as
to
adc
recipients.
there
employability
would
be
determined
under
the
federal
work
incentive
program
definitions
except
that
the
child
care
exemption
was
continued
in
the
same
language
as
that
originally
provided
in
the
1971
enactment.
furthermore,
the
1972
amendments
specifically
stated
that
prior
to
the
time
that
a
work
instead
of
program
registrant
is
actually
enrolled
in
participating
in
the
federal
win
program
but
the
work
referral
and
check
pickup
provisions
would
continue
to
apply.
the
statute
here
at
issue
was
part
of
a
general
welfare
reform
program
initiated
by
the
governor
of
the
state
of
new
york
and
a
message
to
the
legislature
in
march
of
1971.
briefly,
the
purpose
of
the
legislation
was
stated
to
be
--
to
see
to
it
that
we
not
only
continue
to
meet
the
basic
needs
of
those
who
cannot
do
for
themselves,
but
that
we
also
to
encourage
the
young
and
able-bodied,
temporarily
in
need
of
assistance
to
achieve
the
education
and
skills,
the
motivation
and
the
determination
that
will
make
it
possible
for
them
to
become
increasingly
self-sufficient
independent
citizens
who
can
contribute
to
and
share
in
the
responsibility
for
their
families
and
our
society.
with
the
advent
of
the
state’s
work
referral
program,
adopted
as
a
part
of
the
reform
package.
the
employable
recipients
of
public
assistance
in
hr
and
adc
categories
were
subject
to
job
referral
under
either
one
of
two
programs.
the
federal
win
program
applicable
only
to
the
adc
recipients
provides
for
job
or
training
referral
of
certain
categories
of
recipients
in
a
limited
geographical
area,
12
out
of
the
states
58
welfare
districts.
all
employable
hr
recipients
and
employable
adc
recipients
not
participating
in
win,
our
referable
to
employment
under
the
state
statute
and
also
under
the
statute
to
public
work’s
employment,
although
the
public
work
feature
as
to
adc
recipient
was
never
implemented
because
of
hew
objections.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
state
program
operates
also,
but
all
of
the
witnesses
who
testified
in
the
depositions
stated
that
a
person
who
is
eligible
for
the
win
program
must
first
be
referred
to
the
win
program.
and
only
if
there
is
no
position
available
for
him
there
would
he
be
referred
under
the
state
program.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
well,
they
do
actually
operate
both
out
of
state
employment
service.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
yes.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
right.
so
many
slots
are
allocated
to
new
york
and
it’s
determined
by
both
budgetary
and
by
the
contract
determinations
of
the
secretary
of
labor.
in
other
words,
in
annually
they
are
initial
new
contracts
entered
into
with
the
secretary
of
labor
which
provides
for
the
number
of
persons
who
will
be
serviced
under
the
win
program
and
also
provides
for
the
federal
funding.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
they
are
federal
budgetary
considerations.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
well,
it
can
be
determined
re-determined
during
the
year.
and
actually
in
1972-1973
fiscal
year,
the
contract
was
modified
i
think
three
times,
each
time
to
increase
to
amount
of
money
which
would
be
available
and
therefore
the
number
of
slots
and
number
of
persons
to
be
serviced.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
yes,
in
the
1971
and
1972.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
in
some
of
the
offices,
yes.
there
are
few
districts,
i
believe
new
york
city
and
possibly
i
think
erie
county
possibly
that
have
separate
win
offices
specifically
win
offices,
but
for
the
most
part,
it’s
operated
out
of
the
same
office.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
well,
i
think
--
i
think
in
terms
of
the
number
of
people
who
are
serviced,
i
think
the
state
program
has
handled
more
people.
once
again,
it’s
a
question
of
--
ms.
jean
m.
coon
i
think
that
it’s
--
well
in
the
12
districts
that
we
have
most
--once
again
it’s
the
state
program
that
has
generally
handled
more
people
simply
because
of
the
unavailability
of
positions
in
the
win
program.
as
we
said
that
if
there
were
win
positions
open
for
this
people,
and
they
have
the
position
to
put
them
in.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
they
may
--
they
may
be
training
positions
as
well
as
work
position.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
in
the
win
program,
yes.
under
the
win
program,
there
is
a
training
feature
and
they
may
be
referred
to
training.
the
training
feature
under
the
recent
amendments
to
the
win
program
and
the
federal
social
security
act
have
been
the
--
emphasized
has
been
more
a
work
program.
prior
to
that,
the
win
trainee
could
be
in
train
for
an
average
of
one
year.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
well,
i
think
here
in
the
last
six
months
on
the
basis
of
the
record
in
this
case
we’re
talking
about
in
the
first
year,
there
were
--
at
the
same
time
that
there
were
slightly
over
17,000
persons
in
the
win
program.
there
were
29,000
other
public
assistance
recipients
who
were
given
work
experience
under
this
program
either
referred
to
jobs
or
in
public
works
employment.
and
an
average
of
15,000
persons
were
or
50,000
persons
were
reporting
each
month
to
the
state
employment
service
for
manpower
services
for
job
and
for
job
referral
so
that
there
were
say
an
average
of
50,000
persons
each
month.
the
same
persons
over
and
over
again
in
many
cases,
but
these
briefs
were
being
referred
and
i
think
that
in
terms
of
the
29,000
people
who
did
have
some
work
placement
that
it
is
important
to
remember
that
during
this
time,
new
york
state
was
also
an
economic
depression.
new
york
was
one
of
the
--
the
last
to
have
the
increase
unemployment
and
was
also
one
of
the
last
to
get
out
of
the
increase
unemployment
of
past
years.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
no,
it’s
not
likely.
it’s
not
likely
that
a
person
on
the
training
or
a
referral
under
the
win
program
would
most
likely
still
would
--
if
they’re
in
the
win
program
participating
that
even
if
they
had
a
subsequently
became
unemployed,
he
would
still
being
service
to
the
win
program.
so
those
people
--
those
29,000
replaced
under
the
state
program
we’re
not
win
participants.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
yes.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
no,
it’s
in
the
areas
where
--
both
where
the
win
program
operates
and
where
it
does
not.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
because
there
are
some
areas
–
geographically,
the
bulk
of
the
state
--
the
win
program
does
not
operate
in
terms
of
numbers
of
recipients,
most
of
them
are
within
the
win
area.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
under
the
statute,
they
would
be
referred
under
the
state
statute.
under
the
present
situation
as
on
the
decision
which
we
are
here
appealing
the
order
of
the
district
court,
there
is
no
work
requirement
for
the
adc
category
under
--
on
the
present
law.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
the
criteria
are
somewhat
different
in
terms
of
the
methods
by
which
they’re
placed.
for
example,
in
the
win
program
there
is
requirement
that
they’ll
be
given
physical
examinations
before
placement.
we
said
this
is
not
a
significant
question
because
if
there
is
a
question
raise
as
to
physical
capacity,
the
state
employment
service
returns
the
state
referees
to
the
department
of
social
services
or
determination
of
physical
capacity.
so
we
say,
this
is
not
substantial,
it
may
be
a
question
of
the
time
or
a
position
in
which
the
physical
examination
or
physical
consideration
is
taking
care
of.
under
the
federal
regulations,
hew
regulations,
the
local
social
services
department
is
required
to
provide
child
care
services
either
for
persons
who
were
referred
under
the
win
program
or
for
others
for
whom
the
state
requires
either
worker
or
trainings
so
they
come
on
to
the
same
child
care
requirements
that
they
are
in
the
win
program.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
yes.
there
are
some
people
in
training
in
the
win
program
who
are
in
their
60s.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
yes.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
yes.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
well,
the
initial
referral
to
the
win
program
is
made
by
the
local
social
services
offices.
they’re
determined
to
be
referable
there
appropriate
for
win
referral
and
then
referred
to
the
state
employment
service
for
win
registration
and
participation.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
yes.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
that’s
true.
that’s
precisely
true.
principally,
we
submit
to
the
court,
the
state
statutes
and
regulations
here
providing
for
work
referral
and
penalizing
social
services
recipients
for
refusal
to
accept
employment
are
not
in
conflict
to
the
federal
social
security
act.
one
of
the
basic
purposes
of
the
federal
act
is
to
develop
capabilities
of
self-support.
the
federal
act
as
recognized
from
its
initial
inception,
the
objective
of
that
self-support.
the
new
york
rules
we
submit
do
no
more
than
implement
the
intent
of
the
federal
act
by
providing
for
the
referral
of
employable
public
assistance
recipients
to
employment.
they
add
no
new
conditions
of
eligibility,
not
already
contemplated
by
the
federal
act.
the
primary
contention
of
the
appellees
has
been
simply
that
the
federal
social
security
act
was
intended
to
preempt
the
entire
field
of
welfare
regulation
and
work
requirements.
however,
the
social
security
act
--
ms.
jean
m.
coon
there
is
a
30
day
suspension
of
eligibility
if
they
refused
to
comply
with
the
work
referral
provisions
under
the
state
law.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
under
the
federal
law,
it’s
only
so
long
--
they
can
be
suspended
only
so
long
as
they
do
not
or
not
willing
to
participate.
in
other
words
--
ms.
jean
m.
coon
the
appellees
contend
that
it’s
the
state
because
it
has
the
automatic
collusion
of
30
days.
in
other
words,
if
a
person
doesn’t
like
to
comply
under
the
win
program
and
refuses
to
accept
be
the
training
or
employment.
he
then
is
entitled
under
the
win
program
to
a
60-day
counseling
period.
he
doesn’t
have
to
accept
and
he
can’t
be
suspended
during
that
60
days.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
yes,
there
is
no
counseling
period.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
i
don’t
think
that’s
a
statutory
contract.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
well
--
ms.
jean
m.
coon
yes,
but
even
under
--
we’re
--
we
submit
to
the
court
here.
what
we’re
doing
we’re
talking
about
different
people.
that
if
they’re
eligible
for
participation
in
win
and
if
there’s
a
slot
available
for
win,
they
are
entitled
to
all
the
win
procedures.
the
question
of
the
application
of
the
procedures
we
think
is
more
of
question
of
the
due
process
arguments
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
which
the
appellees
raised
in
the
district
court
and
which
they
raised
on
another
appeal
to
this
court
which
is
pending
--
which
is
the
jurisdictional
statement
is
still
pending.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
oh!
no.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
no,
i
don’t
think
so.
because
i
think
that
there
is
a
--
ms.
jean
m.
coon
they
would
contrary
to
federal
act.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
well,
i
think
under
this
because
the
federal
[voice
overlap].
ms.
jean
m.
coon
because
i
think
the
federal
act
itself
has
--
particularly
with
the
unemployed
parent
provision
has
particularly
taken
into
consideration
the
fact
that
the
state
may
provide
--
that
they
setup
this
provision
that
you’re
--
ms.
jean
m.
coon
no,
i
don’t
think
it
is
prohibited
because
for
example
under
the
--under
the
federal
unemployed
parent
program,
it
provides
for
a
discontinuance
of
assistance.
as
i
said
during
the
period
which
a
person
refuses
to
comply
all
are
willing
and
the
congress
in
enacting
this
took
into
consideration
despite
we
said
that
it
would
be
up
to
the
states
that
there
is
leeway
left
with
the
states
to
determine
how
long
this
period
would
be.
but
it
could
not
be
--
it
could
certainly,
cannot
be
forever.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
the
three-judge
court
was
contrary
to
legislative
history.
the
federal
act
without
stating
what
legislative
history
they
had
mind
and
cited
principally
the
decision
of
woolfolk
against
brown
in
the
federal
district
court
in
virginia.
we
submit
that
the
woolfolk
case
is
distinguishable
from
this.
in
that
particular
case,
the
recipients
involved
lived
in
a
win
district.
they
had
not
been
specifically
determined
to
be
inappropriate
for
win
referral.
the
district
court
in
that
case
said
that
that
you
could
not
refer
under
state
program,
persons
who
are
inappropriate
for
referral
to
win.
however,
in
that
case,
reading
a
language
of
the
decision
of
district
court
in
that
case,
they
said
that
determination
as
to
who
is
appropriate
for
referral
or
inappropriate
of
referral
based
on
the
remoteness
was
he
made
on
individual
cases.
and
they
also
said
that
which
he
interpreted
that
saying
that,
that
it
must
apply
only
where
--
only
in
districts
where
there
was
a
win
program.
in
other
words,
that
in
state
districts
were
the
welfare
districts
where
there
is
no
win
program,
the
woolfolk
case
does
not
even
apply
on
its
face.
and
secondly,
that
to
the
extent
that
a
state
program
parallels
and
refers
to
the
win
program
and
takes
into
consideration
those
people
who
have
been
determined
to
be
inappropriate
for
referral
to
win
although
they
can
be
referred
under
the
state
program
under
state
jobs.
we
submit
that,
to
that
extent
the
district
court
in
woolfolk
was
incorrect
in
its
interpretation
of
the
statute
--
of
the
requirements
of
the
statute,
the
supremacy
situation.
now,
we
point
out
to
the
court
that
only
in
the
woolfolk
case
and
those
cases
which
cited
the
district
court
in
woolfolk.
all
of
these
cases
arising
before
this
court
affirm.
that
was
the
only
cases
in
which
the
court
has
ever
held
a
state
parallel
work
requirement
to
be
invalid
under
the
supremacy
clause.
and
there
are
some
20
or
21
states
which
have
developed
parallel
state
work
requirements
at
the
same
time
the
federal
system
has
been
developing
its
work
requirements
under
the
social
security
act.
all
of
these
state
programs
have
developed
a
parallel
and
along
the
same
time
as
the
--
that
the
federal
government
was
getting
into
the
act
of
work
requirements.
so
that
--
ms.
jean
m.
coon
they
found
the
hearing
inadequate
only
as
to
hr
recipients
on
the
basis
that
there
was
no
specific
notification
to
them
of
the
right
of
a
hearing
at
the
time
of
determination
of
employability.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
no,
they
said
that
there
should
be
--
there
should
be
a
–
well,
the
state
law
required
a
hearing.
and
the
evidence
in
the
case
indicated
that
the
state
--
under
the
state
law
a
hearing
as
to
employability
would
be
granted
and
would
be
granted
prior
to
the
time
that
it
could
granted
--
could
be
granted
without
somebody
saying
i
would
comply
and
taking
a
risk
of
losing
our
assistance.
but
the
district
court
found
that
there
should
be
for
due
process,
there
should
be
notification
of
the
right
of
this
hearing
at
the
time
of
the
determination
of
employability
and
directed
the
state
department
of
social
services
to
provide
for
such
notification
which
has
been
done.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
no,
that’s
not.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
right.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
no.
they
simply
found
that
the
additional
hearing
requirement,
there
wasn’t
additional
hearing
requirement
which
--
which
we
should
comply.
we
submit
that
the
test
on
supremacy
start
with
the
question
of
whether
or
not
congress
in
enacting
the
federal
law
has
specifically
stated
that
it’s
preempting
a
field
that
it’s
intended
to
be
--
that
this
federal
statute
intends
to
preempt
the
field.
there
is
no
such
specific
provision
in
that
statute.
the
federal
test
say
that
in
order
to
be
determined,
to
be
invalid,
the
state
statute
must
stand
as
an
obstacle
to
the
accomplishment
of
the
federal
statutory
purposes.
here,
we
say
that
the
two
programs
work
parallel
and
complementary
to
each
other
that
the
state
statute
regulation
never
stands
as
an
obstacle
to
the
accomplishment
of
the
federal
objective
which
in
the
end-result
is
employment,
that
a
state
regulation
must
give
way
only
where
both
the
federal
and
state
regulations
cannot
be
enforced
without
impairing
super
--
federal
superintendence
to
the
field.
here,
we
say
once
again
that
the
two
statutes
worked
together,
that
the
two
systems
of
referral
of
employment
work
together
and
that
the
objective
of
self-sufficiency
is
aimed
at
similar
objectives.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
yes.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
briefly,
i
would
like
to
cover
in
rebuttal
three
points
of
argument.
one,
the
issue
of
preemption
is
one
of
congressional
intent.
i
call
your
honors
attention
to
the
quotes
at
page
7-a
of
our
reply
brief
in
which
we
quote
from
the
chairman
of
the
appropriate
congressional
committees
who
stated
that
it
was
not
their
intent
even
in
enacting
the
win
program
to
prohibit
the
states
from
providing
for
complimentary
work
programs.
i
think
in
the
win
statutes
and
in
the
1971
amendments
themselves,
there
are
some
indications
of
a
lack
of
such
an
intent.
first
of
all,
with
the
15%
penalty
provision
which
provides
for
a
penalty
for
states
which
fail
to
refer
into
the
win
program,
15%
of
their
registrants
for
win
leaves
a
balance
of
85%
of
the
win
registrants
whom
congress
must
have
considered
would
not
necessarily
be
processed
through
the
win
program
and
would
seem
to
me
that
of
those
85%
could
by
the
virtue
of
the
statute
be
left
out
of
any
work
requirement
if
the
state
itself
wanted
to
enact
such
a
requirement
might
raise
serious
constitutional
problems
for
the
15%
who
were
then
--
who
have
been
selected
and
required
to
go
for
employment.
secondly
that
the
--
system
of
priorities
which
were
established
for
referrals
in
the
1971
amendments,
we
submit
to
this
court
involved
a
question
of
the
congressional
determination
of
the
use
of,
proper
use
of
federal
funds
that
the
proper
use
of
the
federal
funds
should
be
in
and
under
the
win
program
to
first
place
an
employment
those
persons
who
were
most
job
ready.
it
does
mean
that
this
was
if
--
sole
priorities
for
persons
and
who
could
be
referred
under
what
conditions
they
could
be
referred
for
employment.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
the
simple
establishment
of
priorities
indicates
the
congressional
intent
not
to
preempt
the
entire
field
to
provide
for
work
and
--
work
or
training
for
all
adc
recipients
because
if
that
--
if
they
were
all
inclusive,
there
would
not
have
necessarily
been
a
system
of
priorities.
if
you're
going
to
include
everybody,
you
don’t
need
to
establish
priorities
for
one
various
classes
you’re
going
to
be
included.
i’d
like
to
call
the
court’s
attention,
the
fact
that
and
clarify
possibly,
the
fact
that
the
number
of
districts
within
the
social
services
districts
within
a
state
and
the
with
--
which
the
win
program
operates
is
a
determination
solely
of
the
united
states
secretary
of
labor.
and
that
in
fact,
as
i
referred
to
one
of
our
briefs,
the
secretary
of
labor
refused
to
request
from
the
state
of
new
york
to
increase
the
number
of
win
districts
within
the
state.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
they
--
ms.
jean
m.
coon
social
security
act
exempts
persons
who
are
too
remote
--
ms.
jean
m.
coon
--
from
our
win
project
to
participate.
under
the
wolford
case,
the
district
court
on
wolford
apparently
interpreted
that
to
mean
too
remote
within
a
win
district
because
it
said
that
the
determinations
to
remoteness
must
be
made
on
individual
basis
and
not
on
a
geographical
area
basis
when
you're
talking
about
social
services
districts
in
which
there
is
no
win
project
presumably
that
the
remoteness
issue
could
be
taken
up
and
it
would
be
a
geographical
determination
rather
than
an
individual
one.
and
i
would
also
--
i
think
that
mr.
yeager
who
has
spoke
as
far
as
win
participants
are
concerned,
new
york
state
does
not
apply
it
30-day
disqualification
to
act
for
participants
in
the
win
program.
the
appellees
here
also
raised
a
question
as
to
additional
conditions
of
eligibility.
i
think
in
our
reply
brief,
we
have
done
--
ms.
jean
m.
coon
well
actually,
under
the
present
new
york
statute,
the
definition
of
employability
for
adc
recipients
under
the
state
program
is
the
win
definition.
the
statute
itself
refers
to
that.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
yes.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
someone
who
is
unemployable
under
win
would
not
be
employable
under
this
present
new
york
state
statute.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
they
did
but
they
were
interpreting
a
1971
statute
prior
to
the
19
--
and
not
the
1972
amendments.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
that
amendments
had
--
were
enacted
actually
prior
to
the
decision
of
the
district
court
but
apparently
we’re
not
called
to
its
attention.
this
program
has
been
in
the
course
of
amendment
ever
since
it
was
enacted.
and
particularly
in
1972,
this
was
an
experimental
program
in
new
york
state
and
they
were
--
hardships
were
--
which
were
discovered,
which
were
taken
cared
of
in
some
cases
by
a
departmental
regulation.
and
in
others
was
by
a
statute,
subsequent
statutory
enactment,
some
of
these
are
in
the
record.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
i
believe
that
the
definition
amendment
had
not
been
called
to
the
court’s
attention
prior
to
its
decision.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
well
i
suppose
it
was
mine
but
i
didn’t
even
know
was
on
the
book
myself
because
the
department
of
social
services
hadn’t
told
he
was
on
[laughter]
--
and
the
--
prior
to
your
honors
and
unfortunately,
we
have
about
16,000
bills
which
go
through
the
new
york
state
legislature
every
year
and
it
--
we
did
know
about
some
of
them.
the
department
had
told
us
about
some
amendments
and
those
were
called
to
the
courts
attention.
there
were
changes
in
the
--
ms.
jean
m.
coon
--
referral
program.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
yes,
it
is
in
our
reply
brief.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
yes,
those
are
in
the
briefs.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
yes.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
yes
it
is.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
no,
it
would
not
be
done
because
the
same
people
make
the
determination
employability
in
win
as
under
the
state
program.
the
win
per
--
people
are
referred
to
win
by
the
state
social
services
department.
the
same
people
who
ref
--
who
would
refer
the
same
recipient
to
the
state
program.
so
the
determination
is
made
by
the
same
person.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
i
think
since
the
definitions
are
the
same,
and
they're
not
simply
copied
definition
(voice
overlap)
--
ms.
jean
m.
coon
no,
i
think
the
result
--
by
the
way
the
statute
is
drafted,
it
has
to
be
the
same.
social
services
stature
which
sets
up
the
state
work
program
specifically
refers
the
definition
of
employability
for
the
adc
recipients
to
that
section
of
the
law
which
relates
to
win.
so
i
think
that
the
determination
has
to
be
identical.
and
there
are
of
course
state
court
procedures
for
viewing
this
determination.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
not
to
an
adc
recipient
who
is
under
the
win
program.
that’s
true.
could
not.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
oh,
i
think
this
court
could
do
what
i
did
in
the
shirley
case,
remand
to
the
district
court
for
consideration
of
72
amendments.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
well,
it's
--
ms.
jean
m.
coon
that’s
what
happened
on
shirley
and
shirley
is
now
in
the
process
of
being
reheard.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
well,
i
think
if
that
is
exact
--
really
if
the
30-day
suspension
were
the
only
issue,
certainly
this
court
could
find
the
statute
invalid
as
to
that
part
without
wiping
out
the
whole
state
program.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
thank
you.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
in
directing
argument
on
the
merits
in
this
case,
this
court
postponed
the
question
of
jurisdiction,
that
issue
has
been
briefed
by
both
appellants
and
i
wish
to
comment
only
briefly
on
jurisdiction.
the
complaint
in
the
instant
case
attack
new
york’s
work
referrals
statutes
claiming
that
they
conflict
not
only
with
the
provisions
of
the
federal
social
security
act,
but
also
that
they
violated
both
the
thirteenth
and
fourteenth
amendments
of
the
constitution
in
the
united
states.
those
latter
issues
were
extensively
briefed
and
argued
by
all
parties.
the
district
court
in
its
decision
rejected
the
thirteenth
and
fourteenth
amendment
claims,
but
did
discuss
them
at
length
and
did
consider
them
substantial
constitutional
questions.
even
though
it
eventually
found
they’re
not
to
be
sustained
on
the
law.
it
is
our
understanding
of
the
decisions
of
this
court
that
as
long
as
the
constitutional
questions
raised
are
substantial
a
statutory
three-judge
court
is
properly
convene
and
consequently
in
appeal
directly
to
this
court
is
also
proper.
even
though
the
district
court
ultimately
rejects
claim
constitutional
invalidity.
we
might
also
observe
that
if
this
is
not
the
case,
then
this
court
should
consider
whether
as
held
by
the
second
circuit
hagans
case
cited
in
the
appellants’
briefs.
there
was
substantial
federal
question
at
all
present
in
the
case,
efficient
to
confer
jurisdiction
even
upon
a
single
district
judge.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
oh!
yes,
your
honor.
that’s
--
that’s
entirely
--
that’s
entirely
true,
but
we
are
also
suggesting
this
court
the
possibility
that
the
court
may
adopt
the
hagans
case
rule
in
the
second
circuit
that
if
the
question
is
found
not
to
be
substantial,
federal
constitutional
question
at
all
that
it’s
a
matter
for
the
state
courts
and
not
for
the
federal
courts
to
determine.
our
main
argument
is
of
course
address
to
the
merits
of
the
state
statutes
here
at
issue.
briefly,
the
statutes
at
the
time
of
the
commencement
of
the
action
provided
that
all
social
services
recipients
in
the
aid
for
dependent
children
and
then
the
totally,
also
the
totally
state-funded
home
relief
categories,
must
if
employable
register
with
the
state
department
--
or
state
employment
service
of
the
state
department
of
labor
report
semi-monthly
to
that
office
for
job
referral
and
to
pick
up
welfare
checks
and
to
accept
employment
when
offered
and
further
provided
for
public
works
project
employment
for
persons
not
placed
in
private
employment.
the
work
referral
statute
also
provides
a
definition
of
those
who
would
be
considered
unemployable.
the
aged,
the
sick
and
disabled,
children
in
school,
vocational
trainees
and
mothers
whose
presence
was
needed
on
the
home
for
care
for
children
or
those
mothers
for
whom
daycare
services
were
not
available.
subsequent
to
the
commencement
of
this
action,
the
referral
statute
was
amendment
to
provide
that
the
original
definition
of
employability
would
apply
only
to
the
home
relief
recipients
and
that
as
to
adc
recipients.
there
employability
would
be
determined
under
the
federal
work
incentive
program
definitions
except
that
the
child
care
exemption
was
continued
in
the
same
language
as
that
originally
provided
in
the
1971
enactment.
furthermore,
the
1972
amendments
specifically
stated
that
prior
to
the
time
that
a
work
instead
of
program
registrant
is
actually
enrolled
in
participating
in
the
federal
win
program
but
the
work
referral
and
check
pickup
provisions
would
continue
to
apply.
the
statute
here
at
issue
was
part
of
a
general
welfare
reform
program
initiated
by
the
governor
of
the
state
of
new
york
and
a
message
to
the
legislature
in
march
of
1971.
briefly,
the
purpose
of
the
legislation
was
stated
to
be
--
to
see
to
it
that
we
not
only
continue
to
meet
the
basic
needs
of
those
who
cannot
do
for
themselves,
but
that
we
also
to
encourage
the
young
and
able-bodied,
temporarily
in
need
of
assistance
to
achieve
the
education
and
skills,
the
motivation
and
the
determination
that
will
make
it
possible
for
them
to
become
increasingly
self-sufficient
independent
citizens
who
can
contribute
to
and
share
in
the
responsibility
for
their
families
and
our
society.
with
the
advent
of
the
state’s
work
referral
program,
adopted
as
a
part
of
the
reform
package.
the
employable
recipients
of
public
assistance
in
hr
and
adc
categories
were
subject
to
job
referral
under
either
one
of
two
programs.
the
federal
win
program
applicable
only
to
the
adc
recipients
provides
for
job
or
training
referral
of
certain
categories
of
recipients
in
a
limited
geographical
area,
12
out
of
the
states
58
welfare
districts.
all
employable
hr
recipients
and
employable
adc
recipients
not
participating
in
win,
our
referable
to
employment
under
the
state
statute
and
also
under
the
statute
to
public
work’s
employment,
although
the
public
work
feature
as
to
adc
recipient
was
never
implemented
because
of
hew
objections.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
state
program
operates
also,
but
all
of
the
witnesses
who
testified
in
the
depositions
stated
that
a
person
who
is
eligible
for
the
win
program
must
first
be
referred
to
the
win
program.
and
only
if
there
is
no
position
available
for
him
there
would
he
be
referred
under
the
state
program.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
well,
they
do
actually
operate
both
out
of
state
employment
service.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
yes.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
right.
so
many
slots
are
allocated
to
new
york
and
it’s
determined
by
both
budgetary
and
by
the
contract
determinations
of
the
secretary
of
labor.
in
other
words,
in
annually
they
are
initial
new
contracts
entered
into
with
the
secretary
of
labor
which
provides
for
the
number
of
persons
who
will
be
serviced
under
the
win
program
and
also
provides
for
the
federal
funding.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
they
are
federal
budgetary
considerations.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
well,
it
can
be
determined
re-determined
during
the
year.
and
actually
in
1972-1973
fiscal
year,
the
contract
was
modified
i
think
three
times,
each
time
to
increase
to
amount
of
money
which
would
be
available
and
therefore
the
number
of
slots
and
number
of
persons
to
be
serviced.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
yes,
in
the
1971
and
1972.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
in
some
of
the
offices,
yes.
there
are
few
districts,
i
believe
new
york
city
and
possibly
i
think
erie
county
possibly
that
have
separate
win
offices
specifically
win
offices,
but
for
the
most
part,
it’s
operated
out
of
the
same
office.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
well,
i
think
--
i
think
in
terms
of
the
number
of
people
who
are
serviced,
i
think
the
state
program
has
handled
more
people.
once
again,
it’s
a
question
of
--
ms.
jean
m.
coon
i
think
that
it’s
--
well
in
the
12
districts
that
we
have
most
--once
again
it’s
the
state
program
that
has
generally
handled
more
people
simply
because
of
the
unavailability
of
positions
in
the
win
program.
as
we
said
that
if
there
were
win
positions
open
for
this
people,
and
they
have
the
position
to
put
them
in.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
they
may
--
they
may
be
training
positions
as
well
as
work
position.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
in
the
win
program,
yes.
under
the
win
program,
there
is
a
training
feature
and
they
may
be
referred
to
training.
the
training
feature
under
the
recent
amendments
to
the
win
program
and
the
federal
social
security
act
have
been
the
--
emphasized
has
been
more
a
work
program.
prior
to
that,
the
win
trainee
could
be
in
train
for
an
average
of
one
year.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
well,
i
think
here
in
the
last
six
months
on
the
basis
of
the
record
in
this
case
we’re
talking
about
in
the
first
year,
there
were
--
at
the
same
time
that
there
were
slightly
over
17,000
persons
in
the
win
program.
there
were
29,000
other
public
assistance
recipients
who
were
given
work
experience
under
this
program
either
referred
to
jobs
or
in
public
works
employment.
and
an
average
of
15,000
persons
were
or
50,000
persons
were
reporting
each
month
to
the
state
employment
service
for
manpower
services
for
job
and
for
job
referral
so
that
there
were
say
an
average
of
50,000
persons
each
month.
the
same
persons
over
and
over
again
in
many
cases,
but
these
briefs
were
being
referred
and
i
think
that
in
terms
of
the
29,000
people
who
did
have
some
work
placement
that
it
is
important
to
remember
that
during
this
time,
new
york
state
was
also
an
economic
depression.
new
york
was
one
of
the
--
the
last
to
have
the
increase
unemployment
and
was
also
one
of
the
last
to
get
out
of
the
increase
unemployment
of
past
years.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
no,
it’s
not
likely.
it’s
not
likely
that
a
person
on
the
training
or
a
referral
under
the
win
program
would
most
likely
still
would
--
if
they’re
in
the
win
program
participating
that
even
if
they
had
a
subsequently
became
unemployed,
he
would
still
being
service
to
the
win
program.
so
those
people
--
those
29,000
replaced
under
the
state
program
we’re
not
win
participants.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
yes.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
no,
it’s
in
the
areas
where
--
both
where
the
win
program
operates
and
where
it
does
not.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
because
there
are
some
areas
–
geographically,
the
bulk
of
the
state
--
the
win
program
does
not
operate
in
terms
of
numbers
of
recipients,
most
of
them
are
within
the
win
area.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
under
the
statute,
they
would
be
referred
under
the
state
statute.
under
the
present
situation
as
on
the
decision
which
we
are
here
appealing
the
order
of
the
district
court,
there
is
no
work
requirement
for
the
adc
category
under
--
on
the
present
law.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
the
criteria
are
somewhat
different
in
terms
of
the
methods
by
which
they’re
placed.
for
example,
in
the
win
program
there
is
requirement
that
they’ll
be
given
physical
examinations
before
placement.
we
said
this
is
not
a
significant
question
because
if
there
is
a
question
raise
as
to
physical
capacity,
the
state
employment
service
returns
the
state
referees
to
the
department
of
social
services
or
determination
of
physical
capacity.
so
we
say,
this
is
not
substantial,
it
may
be
a
question
of
the
time
or
a
position
in
which
the
physical
examination
or
physical
consideration
is
taking
care
of.
under
the
federal
regulations,
hew
regulations,
the
local
social
services
department
is
required
to
provide
child
care
services
either
for
persons
who
were
referred
under
the
win
program
or
for
others
for
whom
the
state
requires
either
worker
or
trainings
so
they
come
on
to
the
same
child
care
requirements
that
they
are
in
the
win
program.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
yes.
there
are
some
people
in
training
in
the
win
program
who
are
in
their
60s.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
yes.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
yes.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
well,
the
initial
referral
to
the
win
program
is
made
by
the
local
social
services
offices.
they’re
determined
to
be
referable
there
appropriate
for
win
referral
and
then
referred
to
the
state
employment
service
for
win
registration
and
participation.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
yes.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
that’s
true.
that’s
precisely
true.
principally,
we
submit
to
the
court,
the
state
statutes
and
regulations
here
providing
for
work
referral
and
penalizing
social
services
recipients
for
refusal
to
accept
employment
are
not
in
conflict
to
the
federal
social
security
act.
one
of
the
basic
purposes
of
the
federal
act
is
to
develop
capabilities
of
self-support.
the
federal
act
as
recognized
from
its
initial
inception,
the
objective
of
that
self-support.
the
new
york
rules
we
submit
do
no
more
than
implement
the
intent
of
the
federal
act
by
providing
for
the
referral
of
employable
public
assistance
recipients
to
employment.
they
add
no
new
conditions
of
eligibility,
not
already
contemplated
by
the
federal
act.
the
primary
contention
of
the
appellees
has
been
simply
that
the
federal
social
security
act
was
intended
to
preempt
the
entire
field
of
welfare
regulation
and
work
requirements.
however,
the
social
security
act
--
ms.
jean
m.
coon
there
is
a
30
day
suspension
of
eligibility
if
they
refused
to
comply
with
the
work
referral
provisions
under
the
state
law.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
under
the
federal
law,
it’s
only
so
long
--
they
can
be
suspended
only
so
long
as
they
do
not
or
not
willing
to
participate.
in
other
words
--
ms.
jean
m.
coon
the
appellees
contend
that
it’s
the
state
because
it
has
the
automatic
collusion
of
30
days.
in
other
words,
if
a
person
doesn’t
like
to
comply
under
the
win
program
and
refuses
to
accept
be
the
training
or
employment.
he
then
is
entitled
under
the
win
program
to
a
60-day
counseling
period.
he
doesn’t
have
to
accept
and
he
can’t
be
suspended
during
that
60
days.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
yes,
there
is
no
counseling
period.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
i
don’t
think
that’s
a
statutory
contract.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
well
--
ms.
jean
m.
coon
yes,
but
even
under
--
we’re
--
we
submit
to
the
court
here.
what
we’re
doing
we’re
talking
about
different
people.
that
if
they’re
eligible
for
participation
in
win
and
if
there’s
a
slot
available
for
win,
they
are
entitled
to
all
the
win
procedures.
the
question
of
the
application
of
the
procedures
we
think
is
more
of
question
of
the
due
process
arguments
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
which
the
appellees
raised
in
the
district
court
and
which
they
raised
on
another
appeal
to
this
court
which
is
pending
--
which
is
the
jurisdictional
statement
is
still
pending.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
oh!
no.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
no,
i
don’t
think
so.
because
i
think
that
there
is
a
--
ms.
jean
m.
coon
they
would
contrary
to
federal
act.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
well,
i
think
under
this
because
the
federal
[voice
overlap].
ms.
jean
m.
coon
because
i
think
the
federal
act
itself
has
--
particularly
with
the
unemployed
parent
provision
has
particularly
taken
into
consideration
the
fact
that
the
state
may
provide
--
that
they
setup
this
provision
that
you’re
--
ms.
jean
m.
coon
no,
i
don’t
think
it
is
prohibited
because
for
example
under
the
--under
the
federal
unemployed
parent
program,
it
provides
for
a
discontinuance
of
assistance.
as
i
said
during
the
period
which
a
person
refuses
to
comply
all
are
willing
and
the
congress
in
enacting
this
took
into
consideration
despite
we
said
that
it
would
be
up
to
the
states
that
there
is
leeway
left
with
the
states
to
determine
how
long
this
period
would
be.
but
it
could
not
be
--
it
could
certainly,
cannot
be
forever.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
the
three-judge
court
was
contrary
to
legislative
history.
the
federal
act
without
stating
what
legislative
history
they
had
mind
and
cited
principally
the
decision
of
woolfolk
against
brown
in
the
federal
district
court
in
virginia.
we
submit
that
the
woolfolk
case
is
distinguishable
from
this.
in
that
particular
case,
the
recipients
involved
lived
in
a
win
district.
they
had
not
been
specifically
determined
to
be
inappropriate
for
win
referral.
the
district
court
in
that
case
said
that
that
you
could
not
refer
under
state
program,
persons
who
are
inappropriate
for
referral
to
win.
however,
in
that
case,
reading
a
language
of
the
decision
of
district
court
in
that
case,
they
said
that
determination
as
to
who
is
appropriate
for
referral
or
inappropriate
of
referral
based
on
the
remoteness
was
he
made
on
individual
cases.
and
they
also
said
that
which
he
interpreted
that
saying
that,
that
it
must
apply
only
where
--
only
in
districts
where
there
was
a
win
program.
in
other
words,
that
in
state
districts
were
the
welfare
districts
where
there
is
no
win
program,
the
woolfolk
case
does
not
even
apply
on
its
face.
and
secondly,
that
to
the
extent
that
a
state
program
parallels
and
refers
to
the
win
program
and
takes
into
consideration
those
people
who
have
been
determined
to
be
inappropriate
for
referral
to
win
although
they
can
be
referred
under
the
state
program
under
state
jobs.
we
submit
that,
to
that
extent
the
district
court
in
woolfolk
was
incorrect
in
its
interpretation
of
the
statute
--
of
the
requirements
of
the
statute,
the
supremacy
situation.
now,
we
point
out
to
the
court
that
only
in
the
woolfolk
case
and
those
cases
which
cited
the
district
court
in
woolfolk.
all
of
these
cases
arising
before
this
court
affirm.
that
was
the
only
cases
in
which
the
court
has
ever
held
a
state
parallel
work
requirement
to
be
invalid
under
the
supremacy
clause.
and
there
are
some
20
or
21
states
which
have
developed
parallel
state
work
requirements
at
the
same
time
the
federal
system
has
been
developing
its
work
requirements
under
the
social
security
act.
all
of
these
state
programs
have
developed
a
parallel
and
along
the
same
time
as
the
--
that
the
federal
government
was
getting
into
the
act
of
work
requirements.
so
that
--
ms.
jean
m.
coon
they
found
the
hearing
inadequate
only
as
to
hr
recipients
on
the
basis
that
there
was
no
specific
notification
to
them
of
the
right
of
a
hearing
at
the
time
of
determination
of
employability.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
no,
they
said
that
there
should
be
--
there
should
be
a
–
well,
the
state
law
required
a
hearing.
and
the
evidence
in
the
case
indicated
that
the
state
--
under
the
state
law
a
hearing
as
to
employability
would
be
granted
and
would
be
granted
prior
to
the
time
that
it
could
granted
--
could
be
granted
without
somebody
saying
i
would
comply
and
taking
a
risk
of
losing
our
assistance.
but
the
district
court
found
that
there
should
be
for
due
process,
there
should
be
notification
of
the
right
of
this
hearing
at
the
time
of
the
determination
of
employability
and
directed
the
state
department
of
social
services
to
provide
for
such
notification
which
has
been
done.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
no,
that’s
not.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
right.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
no.
they
simply
found
that
the
additional
hearing
requirement,
there
wasn’t
additional
hearing
requirement
which
--
which
we
should
comply.
we
submit
that
the
test
on
supremacy
start
with
the
question
of
whether
or
not
congress
in
enacting
the
federal
law
has
specifically
stated
that
it’s
preempting
a
field
that
it’s
intended
to
be
--
that
this
federal
statute
intends
to
preempt
the
field.
there
is
no
such
specific
provision
in
that
statute.
the
federal
test
say
that
in
order
to
be
determined,
to
be
invalid,
the
state
statute
must
stand
as
an
obstacle
to
the
accomplishment
of
the
federal
statutory
purposes.
here,
we
say
that
the
two
programs
work
parallel
and
complementary
to
each
other
that
the
state
statute
regulation
never
stands
as
an
obstacle
to
the
accomplishment
of
the
federal
objective
which
in
the
end-result
is
employment,
that
a
state
regulation
must
give
way
only
where
both
the
federal
and
state
regulations
cannot
be
enforced
without
impairing
super
--
federal
superintendence
to
the
field.
here,
we
say
once
again
that
the
two
statutes
worked
together,
that
the
two
systems
of
referral
of
employment
work
together
and
that
the
objective
of
self-sufficiency
is
aimed
at
similar
objectives.

coon
yes.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
briefly,
i
would
like
to
cover
in
rebuttal
three
points
of
argument.
one,
the
issue
of
preemption
is
one
of
congressional
intent.
i
call
your
honors
attention
to
the
quotes
at
page
7-a
of
our
reply
brief
in
which
we
quote
from
the
chairman
of
the
appropriate
congressional
committees
who
stated
that
it
was
not
their
intent
even
in
enacting
the
win
program
to
prohibit
the
states
from
providing
for
complimentary
work
programs.
i
think
in
the
win
statutes
and
in
the
1971
amendments
themselves,
there
are
some
indications
of
a
lack
of
such
an
intent.
first
of
all,
with
the
15%
penalty
provision
which
provides
for
a
penalty
for
states
which
fail
to
refer
into
the
win
program,
15%
of
their
registrants
for
win
leaves
a
balance
of
85%
of
the
win
registrants
whom
congress
must
have
considered
would
not
necessarily
be
processed
through
the
win
program
and
would
seem
to
me
that
of
those
85%
could
by
the
virtue
of
the
statute
be
left
out
of
any
work
requirement
if
the
state
itself
wanted
to
enact
such
a
requirement
might
raise
serious
constitutional
problems
for
the
15%
who
were
then
--
who
have
been
selected
and
required
to
go
for
employment.
secondly
that
the
--
system
of
priorities
which
were
established
for
referrals
in
the
1971
amendments,
we
submit
to
this
court
involved
a
question
of
the
congressional
determination
of
the
use
of,
proper
use
of
federal
funds
that
the
proper
use
of
the
federal
funds
should
be
in
and
under
the
win
program
to
first
place
an
employment
those
persons
who
were
most
job
ready.
it
does
mean
that
this
was
if
--
sole
priorities
for
persons
and
who
could
be
referred
under
what
conditions
they
could
be
referred
for
employment.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
the
simple
establishment
of
priorities
indicates
the
congressional
intent
not
to
preempt
the
entire
field
to
provide
for
work
and
--
work
or
training
for
all
adc
recipients
because
if
that
--
if
they
were
all
inclusive,
there
would
not
have
necessarily
been
a
system
of
priorities.
if
you're
going
to
include
everybody,
you
don’t
need
to
establish
priorities
for
one
various
classes
you’re
going
to
be
included.
i’d
like
to
call
the
court’s
attention,
the
fact
that
and
clarify
possibly,
the
fact
that
the
number
of
districts
within
the
social
services
districts
within
a
state
and
the
with
--
which
the
win
program
operates
is
a
determination
solely
of
the
united
states
secretary
of
labor.
and
that
in
fact,
as
i
referred
to
one
of
our
briefs,
the
secretary
of
labor
refused
to
request
from
the
state
of
new
york
to
increase
the
number
of
win
districts
within
the
state.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
they
--
ms.
jean
m.
coon
social
security
act
exempts
persons
who
are
too
remote
--
ms.
jean
m.
coon
--
from
our
win
project
to
participate.
under
the
wolford
case,
the
district
court
on
wolford
apparently
interpreted
that
to
mean
too
remote
within
a
win
district
because
it
said
that
the
determinations
to
remoteness
must
be
made
on
individual
basis
and
not
on
a
geographical
area
basis
when
you're
talking
about
social
services
districts
in
which
there
is
no
win
project
presumably
that
the
remoteness
issue
could
be
taken
up
and
it
would
be
a
geographical
determination
rather
than
an
individual
one.
and
i
would
also
--
i
think
that
mr.
yeager
who
has
spoke
as
far
as
win
participants
are
concerned,
new
york
state
does
not
apply
it
30-day
disqualification
to
act
for
participants
in
the
win
program.
the
appellees
here
also
raised
a
question
as
to
additional
conditions
of
eligibility.
i
think
in
our
reply
brief,
we
have
done
--
ms.
jean
m.
coon
well
actually,
under
the
present
new
york
statute,
the
definition
of
employability
for
adc
recipients
under
the
state
program
is
the
win
definition.
the
statute
itself
refers
to
that.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
yes.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
someone
who
is
unemployable
under
win
would
not
be
employable
under
this
present
new
york
state
statute.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
they
did
but
they
were
interpreting
a
1971
statute
prior
to
the
19
--
and
not
the
1972
amendments.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
that
amendments
had
--
were
enacted
actually
prior
to
the
decision
of
the
district
court
but
apparently
we’re
not
called
to
its
attention.
this
program
has
been
in
the
course
of
amendment
ever
since
it
was
enacted.
and
particularly
in
1972,
this
was
an
experimental
program
in
new
york
state
and
they
were
--
hardships
were
--
which
were
discovered,
which
were
taken
cared
of
in
some
cases
by
a
departmental
regulation.
and
in
others
was
by
a
statute,
subsequent
statutory
enactment,
some
of
these
are
in
the
record.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
i
believe
that
the
definition
amendment
had
not
been
called
to
the
court’s
attention
prior
to
its
decision.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
well
i
suppose
it
was
mine
but
i
didn’t
even
know
was
on
the
book
myself
because
the
department
of
social
services
hadn’t
told
he
was
on
[laughter]
--
and
the
--
prior
to
your
honors
and
unfortunately,
we
have
about
16,000
bills
which
go
through
the
new
york
state
legislature
every
year
and
it
--
we
did
know
about
some
of
them.
the
department
had
told
us
about
some
amendments
and
those
were
called
to
the
courts
attention.
there
were
changes
in
the
--
ms.
jean
m.
coon
--
referral
program.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
yes,
it
is
in
our
reply
brief.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
yes,
those
are
in
the
briefs.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
yes.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
yes
it
is.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
no,
it
would
not
be
done
because
the
same
people
make
the
determination
employability
in
win
as
under
the
state
program.
the
win
per
--
people
are
referred
to
win
by
the
state
social
services
department.
the
same
people
who
ref
--
who
would
refer
the
same
recipient
to
the
state
program.
so
the
determination
is
made
by
the
same
person.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
i
think
since
the
definitions
are
the
same,
and
they're
not
simply
copied
definition
(voice
overlap)
--
ms.
jean
m.
coon
no,
i
think
the
result
--
by
the
way
the
statute
is
drafted,
it
has
to
be
the
same.
social
services
stature
which
sets
up
the
state
work
program
specifically
refers
the
definition
of
employability
for
the
adc
recipients
to
that
section
of
the
law
which
relates
to
win.
so
i
think
that
the
determination
has
to
be
identical.
and
there
are
of
course
state
court
procedures
for
viewing
this
determination.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
not
to
an
adc
recipient
who
is
under
the
win
program.
that’s
true.
could
not.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
oh,
i
think
this
court
could
do
what
i
did
in
the
shirley
case,
remand
to
the
district
court
for
consideration
of
72
amendments.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
well,
it's
--
ms.
jean
m.
coon
that’s
what
happened
on
shirley
and
shirley
is
now
in
the
process
of
being
reheard.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
well,
i
think
if
that
is
exact
--
really
if
the
30-day
suspension
were
the
only
issue,
certainly
this
court
could
find
the
statute
invalid
as
to
that
part
without
wiping
out
the
whole
state
program.
