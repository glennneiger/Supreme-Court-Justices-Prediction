justice
byron
r.
white
is
there
an
additional
section
of
--
is
there
an
additional
section
provided
by
the
new
york
law
over
what
the
federal
law
would
--
justice
byron
r.
white
how
about
federal?
justice
byron
r.
white
mrs.
coon,
which
is
the
more
severe?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
he
could
be
under
the
state
court?
justice
byron
r.
white
now
is
that
a
--
you
don’t
think
that
that’s
a
contract
at
all?
justice
byron
r.
white
once
it
is
a
--
it
certainly
is
a
refusal
of
the
pay
benefits
for
a
period
of
time
which
under
the
federal
law
would
be
required
based
on
the
win
program?
justice
byron
r.
white
isn’t
that
right?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
would
you
suggest
that
--
that
the
state
would
be
permitted
on
to
have
a
pair
--
a
parallel
work
program
or
work
program
parallel
with
win
and
for
a
person
who
couldn’t
get
into
a
win
slot
who
refused
to
go
along
with
the
state
referral
program?
that
person
could
permanently
be
deprived
of
all
pay?
justice
byron
r.
white
why
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
would
be
contrary
to
federal
act?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
how
can
you
so
--
justice
byron
r.
white
deprive
him
for
60
days
or
30
days?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
may
be
quite
right
that
work
referral
program
is
such
is
inconsistent.
but
what
about
your
sanction,
is
that
permitted
by
the
federal?
that’s
what
i’m
asking
you.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
,
you
there
--
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
are
--
there
are
instances
of
this?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
what's
1983
got
to
do
with
the
three-judge
court?
i
mean,
that
might
--
there
might
be
a
federal
jurisdiction
on
the
1983
but
not
of
course
a
three-judge
court
just
because
it’s
1983?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
guess,
on
the
federal
court.
no,
that’s
right,
it
doesn’t
require
a
three-judge
forum.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
so
--
justice
rehnquist’s
question
still
remains
then.
if
there
was
not
a
substantial
and
unconstitutional
question
to
require
a
three-judge
court,
could
the
three-judge
court
continue
to
address
itself
to
the
statutory
question
just
because
of
19
--
it’s
a
1983
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
if
there
isn’t
one,
it
should
not.
is
that
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
right.
okay.
justice
byron
r.
white
thank
you.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
how
about
the
ones
who
want
to
go
into
win
and
the
federal
government
says
you’re
exempted
from
win
or
that
you
are
unemployable
or
for
some
reason
that
program
thinks
that
they
need’nt
--
or
they
shouldn’t
take
employment.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
and
you
just
disagree
with
your
colleague
here
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
as
to
whether
or
not
new
york
would
just
actually
disqualify
or
terminate
someone
in
that
category.
justice
byron
r.
white
3925
didn’t
the
lower
court
hold
the
contrary?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
then,
is
that
issue
before
--
is
that
conflict
issue
here
then?
was
that
(inaudible)?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
say
mrs.
coon,
the
72
amendments
had
been
called
to
the
--
were
on
the
books
but
had
not
been
called
at
the
time?
justice
byron
r.
white
whose
responsibility
was
it
to
call
it
to
their
attention?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
is
it--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
have
you
put
in
your
brief
or
any
papers
in
this
court
the
72
amendments?
(voice
overlap)
justice
byron
r.
white
--
and
as
compared
with
the
(inaudible)
previous
law
that
the
district
court’s
concern,
(voice
overlap)?
justice
byron
r.
white
mrs.
coons,
if
one
thought
that
the
72
amendments
were
critical
to
the
resolution
of
the
conflict
issue
in
this
case,
what
do
you
suggest
one
should
do
with
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
after
being
all
the
way
up
here,
we
send
it
all
the
way
back.
justice
byron
r.
white
do
it
all
over
again?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
still
leaves
the
question
though
of
--
of
a
--
the
remedy
or
the
30-day
business
that
--
the
inflexibility
of
a
30-day
suspension
as
to
compared
with
the
federal?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
there
an
additional
section
of
--
is
there
an
additional
section
provided
by
the
new
york
law
over
what
the
federal
law
would
--
justice
byron
r.
white
how
about
federal?
justice
byron
r.
white
mrs.
coon,
which
is
the
more
severe?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
he
could
be
under
the
state
court?
justice
byron
r.
white
now
is
that
a
--
you
don’t
think
that
that’s
a
contract
at
all?
justice
byron
r.
white
once
it
is
a
--
it
certainly
is
a
refusal
of
the
pay
benefits
for
a
period
of
time
which
under
the
federal
law
would
be
required
based
on
the
win
program?
justice
byron
r.
white
isn’t
that
right?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
would
you
suggest
that
--
that
the
state
would
be
permitted
on
to
have
a
pair
--
a
parallel
work
program
or
work

parallel
with

and
for
a
person
who
couldn’t
get
into
a

slot
who
refused
to
go
along
with
the
state
referral
program?
that
person
could
permanently
be
deprived
of
all
pay?
justice
byron
r.
white
why
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
would
be
contrary
to
federal
act?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
how
can
you
so
--
justice
byron
r.
white
deprive
him
for
60
days
or
30
days?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
may
be
quite
right
that
work
referral
program
is
such
is
inconsistent.
but
what
about
your
sanction,
is
that
permitted
by
the
federal?
that’s
what
i’m
asking
you.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
,
you
there
--
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
are
--
there
are
instances
of
this?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
what's
1983
got
to
do
with
the
three-judge
court?
i
mean,
that
might
--
there
might
be
a
federal
jurisdiction
on
the
1983
but
not
of
course
a
three-judge
court
just
because
it’s
1983?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
guess,
on
the
federal
court.
no,
that’s
right,
it
doesn’t
require
a
three-judge
forum.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
so
--
justice
rehnquist’s
question
still
remains
then.
if
there
was
not
a
substantial
and
unconstitutional
question
to
require
a
three-judge
court,
could
the
three-judge
court
continue
to
address
itself
to
the
statutory
question
just
because
of
19
--
it’s
a
1983
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
if
there
isn’t
one,
it
should
not.
is
that
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
right.
okay.
justice
byron
r.
white
thank
you.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
how
about
the
ones
who
want
to
go
into
win
and
the
federal
government
says
you’re
exempted
from
win
or
that
you
are
unemployable
or

some
reason
that
program
thinks
that

justice

well
then,
is
that
issue
before

is
that

was
that
(inaudible)?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
say
mrs.
coon,
the
72

had
been
called

the

well,
is

justice
byron

--
have
you
put
in
your
brief
or
any
papers
in
this
court
the
72
amendments?
(voice

justice
byron

and
as
compared
with
the
(inaudible)
previous
law
that
the
district
court’s
concern,
(voice

justice
byron

white
mrs.
coons,
if
one
thought
that
the
72

were
critical
to
the
resolution
of
the
conflict

in
this
case,
what

justice

after
being
all
the

up
here,
we
send
it
all
the
way
back.
justice
byron

do
it
all
over
again?
justice

white
but
still
leaves
the
question
though
of

of
