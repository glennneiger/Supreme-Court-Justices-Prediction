justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
in
the
districts
where
you
have
win,
does
state
program
operate
also?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
do
they
actually
operate
in
the
same
buildings
or
something
like
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
both
out
of
state
employment?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
the
budgetary
considerations
are
federal
budgetary?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
which
program
makes
the
greater
number
of
referrals?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
how
about
in
the
12
districts
--
in
the
12
districts
where
it
have
both?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
the
win
positions
don’t
different
in
different
kind,
do
they
from
the
state?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
is
in
the
win?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
numbers
are
we
talking
about
to
say
for
the
last
six
months
period?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
i
take
it
the
same
recipient
might
perhaps
have
been
--
worked
under
both
programs?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
these
were
additions
to
the
win
referral?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
on
the
work
referrals,
apart
from
the
training
referrals
you
told
us
about
the
win
program,
are
the
criteria
any
different?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
wonder
when
you
have
the
same
personnel
administering
both
programs
how
the
decision
is
made
whether
they’ll
refer
into
one
or
the
other
refer?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mrs.
coon,
what
do
you
understand
as
the
basis
upon
which
the
three-judge
court
held
that
the
win
program
was
exclusive?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
incidentally
i
gather
the
three-judge
court
also
from
the
hearing
provided
inadequate
on
due
process
grounds.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
and
this,
however
was
on
the
hearing
requirements
connection
with
the
win
program
which
they
said
was
exclusive.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what's
closing
cases?
what's
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
does
that
mean
you
terminate
benefits
or
what?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
completely?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
thought
mrs.
coons
told
us
differently
yesterday?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
thought
i
asked
you
whether
the
same
personnel
administered
both
programs,
i
thought
you
answered
me
that
they
did?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
they
are
different
personnel
(voice
overlap)?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
this
is
a
state
department
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
other
than
that
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
yeager,
i
think
mrs.
coons
told
us
that
there
are
some
56
districts
in
new
york
and
the
win
program
has
been
--
is
operative
only
in
some
10
or
12?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
even
so,
is
that
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
is
that
--
is
your
preemption
argument
that
even
in
those
districts
where
win
is
not
presently
being
operated,
the
state
program
may
not
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
other
words,
it's
complete
exclusion?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
in
limiting
the
12
districts
even
--
whatever
maybe
the
number
of
beneficiary
to
recipients,
is
that
compliance?
is
the
state
complying
with
the
requirements
of
the
win
program?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
to
have
a
win
program
say
in
rochester,
how
about
one
lived
--
a
recipient
lived
30,
40
miles
from
rochester,
he
might
be
exempt
although
--
merely
because
he
lives
that
far
away
from
rochester?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
that
he
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
how
does
he
get
his
exemption?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
they
have
a
certificate
or
something
to
indicate
this
exemption?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
let
me
see
if
i
get
this
mr.
yeager.
that
--
the
win
program
is
so
structured
that
a
person
has
to
go
through
stages
before
finally
he
ends
up
in
a
job
placement.
training
and
this
is
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now
suppose
on
the
way
up
for
one
reason
or
another,
it's
time
and
he
doesn’t
qualify
and
he
doesn’t
--
therefore,
he
is
not
required
finally
to
go
to
a
job
placement.
do
i
understand
you
that
then
the
new
york
program
can
pick
him
up
and
require
him
to
take
a
job
placement
without
the
training
and
other
things
that
the
win
program
calls
for
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
then
if
he
doesn’t,
although
under
win,
he’d
continue
to
get
his
benefits,
under
the
state
program,
they’d
be
terminated,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
in
the
districts
where
you
have
win,
does
state
program
operate
also?
justice
william
j.

do

so
the

considerations

justice
william
j.

jr.
which

makes
the

of

justice
william

well,
how
about
in
the
12

--
in

don’t
