well,
i
presume
mrs.
coon
that
even
if

if
this
court
were
to
determine
if
the
constitutional
question
has
been
insubstantial
under
bailey
against
patterson,
and
the
phillips
case,
we
would
have
authority
to
remand
for
hearing
before
a
single
district
judge
on
your
appeal,
are
you
not?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
no
statute
was
stuck
down
or
any
part
of
any
statute
struck
down
in
that
adjudication.

mr.
yeager,

were
so
insubstantial
that
he
would
refuse
to
convene
a
three-judge
district
court
to
hear
it.

your
statutory
claim
under

under
any
act
of
congress
providing
for
the
protection
of
civil
rights
including
the
right
to
vote,
would
you
contend
that
the
social
security
act
was
an
act
for
the
protection
of
civil
right?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
is
it
as
mr.
yeager
said
was
