mr.
dennis
r.
yeager
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
does
not
involve
a
question
of
the
perfection
of
the
federal
work
incentive
program.
in
1967,
congress
enacted
for
the
first
time
a
compulsory
work
program
for
all
afdc
recipients
which
it
required
each
of
the
states
to
include
in
its
plan
of
aid
to
families
with
dependent
children.
when
it
enacted
that
program,
it
described
the
program
in
the
introductory
statutory
material
as
being
designed
to
cultivate
in
individuals
the
sense
of
dignity,
self-worth
and
confidence
that
flows
from
being
a
wage
earning
member
of
society.
in
1971,
the
state
of
new
york
elected
to
enact
its
own
compulsory
work
program
applicable
also
to
afdc
recipients
which
established
the
presumption
of
employability
for
such
recipients
and
which
was
designed
to
and
to
a
certain
extent
did
achieve
maximum
welfare
role
reductions.
one
administrator
in
the
state
of
new
york
characterized
the
results
under
the
program
as
follows.
“last
month,
the
weekend
of
october
5,
we
closed
a
hundred
cases.
i
haven’t
really
gotten
to
closing
codes
for
all
of
these
cases.
i
would
think
that
the
employment
section
is
having
a
greater
impact
on
the
right
of
closing.
we
are
closing
a
very
great
proportion
of
cases
on
the
basis
of
failure
to
comply
on
the
employment
procedures.
that
seems
to
be
reflective
of
a
somewhat
different
purpose
than
the
purpose
which
congress
had
in
mind
when
it
enacted
the
statute
designed
to
cultivate
a
sense
of
dignity,
self-worth
and
confidence.”
it’s
also
worthy
of
note
that
that
quotation
is
not
exceptional
--
mr.
dennis
r.
yeager
closing
cases?
well,
your
honor,
in
a
study
that
was
done
by
the
department
of
health,
education,
and
welfare
and
the
department
of
labor
of
the
administration
of
this
program
in
the
state
of
new
york,
it
was
found
that
what
they
were
--
i’m
sorry,
not
an
--
it
wasn’t
a
study,
excuse
me,
in
a
--
in
the
stipulation
to
fact
in
the
case,
it
appears
that
approximately
11,000
jobs
were
found
while
approximately
13,000
case
closings
occurred
as
the
result
of
failures
to
comply
not
as
the
result
--
mr.
dennis
r.
yeager
terminating
benefits.
and
now
--
mr.
dennis
r.
yeager
completely.
that’s
correct
your
honor.
except
--
that
is
as
to
the
individual
who
is
refusing
to
take
part.
if
there's
some
other
individual
in
the
family
who
is
still
eligible
for
afdc,
they
would
continue
to
receive
their
share
of
the
benefits.
mr.
dennis
r.
yeager
that’s
correct
your
honor.
mr.
dennis
r.
yeager
that
would
be
correct.
some
of
those
would
be
attributable
to
failure
to
come
and
pick
up
their
check
and
that
could
mean
that
there
was
a
very
substantial
hardship
amounting
almost
to
impossibility
for
some
people
to
pick
up
those
checks.
mr.
dennis
r.
yeager
the
purpose
--
mr.
dennis
r.
yeager
--
was
characterized
by
hew
as
possible
harassment
in
a
letter,
exhibit
16
in
the
case.
the
purpose
also
i
think
was
rather
un
--
specifically
applied
because
the
study
to
which
i
inadvertently
referred
a
moment
ago,
the
hew
dol
study
found
that
some
67%
of
the
people
who
claimed
that
they
were
not
employable;
i.e.
should
not
be
required
to
report
--
mr.
dennis
r.
yeager
--
were
incorrectly
characterized
as
people
who
should
report.
mr.
dennis
r.
yeager
your
honor,
i’m
not
sure
that
that
was
ever
explicitly
stated
by
the
governor
when
he
introduced
the
legislation
in
the
state.
i
take
it
that
it
was
part
of
the
purpose,
overall
purpose
of
securing
a
checkup
on
whether
or
not
individuals
were
employable.
the
statute
required
that
the
individual
obtain
a
certificate
from
the
state
employment
service
semimonthly
that
there
is
no
job
available
for
that
person.
that
was
one
of
the
purposes
certainly
to
discharge
a
require
--
that
particular
requirement
of
the
statute.
mr.
dennis
r.
yeager
your
honor,
it
would
be
a
means
of
doing
that,
but
i
think
the
purpose
of
the
statute
as
stated
by
new
york
when
it
was
enacted
was
to
provide
for
employability
of
welfare
recipients.
mr.
dennis
r.
yeager
i
don’t
think
the
purpose
was
stated
to
be
that
by
the
governor
when
he
introduced
it.
mi
mean
it
would
have
that
effect.
i
mean,
it
would
have
that
effect.
mr.
dennis
r.
yeager
i’m
sure
that
that
isn’t
the
case
in
the
problem
your
honor.
i
think
hew
--
mr.
dennis
r.
yeager
yes.
i
think
hew
does
suggest
in
its
manual
that
the
most
appropriate
method
for
delivering
checks
to
individuals
is
through
the
mail.
i
think
that
the
requirement
as
it
was
enacted
in
the
state
of
new
york
was
really
one
related
to
those
employability
requirements.
interestingly,
you
know,
the
state
of
new
york
did
have
a
residence
requirement
which
they
enacted
at
the
same
time
which
was
held
to
be
unconstitutional.
and
that
particular
requirement
presumably
would’ve
been
in
the
place
in
which
the
state
would’ve
enacted
a
requirement
that
was
specifically
addressed
to
the
problem
of
dual
residency.
that
was
enacted
at
the
same
time
as
a
work
program.
four
district
courts
and
one
circuit
court
of
appeals
have
reached
the
conclusion
that
the
compulsory
work
program
established
by
congress
has
precluded
the
states
from
enacting
similar
compulsory
work
programs.
those
decisions
for
a
right
on
three
separate
grounds
in
this
particular
case.
first
of
all,
they
were
right
because
the
federal
government
has
preempted
the
state
activity
in
this
area.
secondly,
the
decisions
were
right
because
the
work
rules
constituted
additional
conditions
of
ineligibility.
thirdly,
they
were
right
as
applied
to
this
particular
case
because
the
new
york
statute
is
in
conflict
with
the
federal
statute
at
so
many
points.
in
1935,
congress
enacted
the
social
security
act.
the
president’s
message
which
conveyed
that
act
to
the
congress
included
within
it
a
suggestion
of
a
program
for
aid
to
widowed
and
otherwise,
separated
mothers.
that
program
according
to
the
message
was
“designed
to
release
from
the
wage
earning
role
the
person
whose
natural
function
is
to
give
her
children
the
physical
and
mental
guardianship
necessary.”
in
other
words,
the
program
was
designed
to
be
for
people
whom
congress
had
made
a
judgment
should
not
be
employed
outside
the
home.
secondly,
in
1961,
congress
amended
the
social
security
act.
for
the
first
time,
it
included
in
the
coverage
of
the
act,
children
in
homes
in
which
a
breadwinner
was
present.
as
part
of
that
act
and
for
the
first
time,
congress
imposed
a
requirement
that
the
breadwinner
accept
jobs
to
which
he
would
be
referred
and
report
to
the
state
employment
service.
that
is
the
first
time
that
we
find
a
requirement
of
compulsory
work
in
the
federal
afdc
program.
in
1962,
congress
then
enacted
a
com
–
a
different
compulsory
program
known
as
the
community
work
and
training
program.
the
legislative
history
of
that
program
is
set
out
in
the
brief
submitted
by
the
national
welfare
rights
organization
as
amicus
curiae
indicates
that
that
program
was
still
to
be
primarily
for
those
fathers
who
were
in
the
afdcu
program,
the
breadwinners.
however,
and
most
importantly,
when
working
--
when
work
incentive
program
was
enacted
in
1967,
both
of
those
programs
were
repealed
and
replaced
by
requirements
that
states
have
work
incentive
programs.
the
community
work
and
training
program
was
completely
repealed.
the
requirement
in
the
afdcu
program
that
fathers
accept
work
to
which
they
were
referred
was
repealed
and
replaced
by
a
requirement
that
the
state’s
put
all
such
fathers
in
the
work
incentive
program
within
30
days
of
their
eligibility
for
afdcu
benefits.
what
the
work
incentive
program
did
was
it
identified
those
individuals
who
in
the
judgment
of
congress
were
appropriate
for
compulsory
work
or
training.
it
also
identified
those
individuals
by
--
those
individuals
who
were
inappropriate
for
compulsory
work
or
training.
thirdly,
it
established
an
elaborate
program
of
job
placement
and
training
for
appropriate
individuals
and
volunteers.
fourthly
and
very
importantly,
it
established
--
it
authorized
the
establishment
of
a
separate
administrative
agency
which
would
handle
the
work
incentive
program.
and
different
individuals
in
the
state
employment
service
do
in
fact
operate
the
work
incentive
program
from
those
individuals
who
operate
the
normal
state
employment
service
referrals.
fifthly,
to
repeat,
the
work
incentive
program
repealed
--
mr.
dennis
r.
yeager
your
honor,
i
believe
that,
if
i
recall
--
mr.
dennis
r.
yeager
i
thought
that
you
said
the
same
offices
did
your
honor.
i
--
it
might
be
that
my
recollection
is
incorrect,
but
these
people
are
located
in
the
same
building.
mr.
dennis
r.
yeager
they're
different
personnel.
the
department
of
labor
and
its
working
center
program
manual
lists
ten
separate
job
titles
--
mr.
dennis
r.
yeager
no,
i’m
sorry
your
honor.
mr.
dennis
r.
yeager
the
federal
department
of
labor
that
administers
the
work
incentive
program
--
mr.
dennis
r.
yeager
--
lists
ten
different
job
titles
which
it
considers
essential
to
the
operation
of
the
work
incentive
program.
in
1971,
there
were
further
amendments
to
the
work
incentive
program
and
those
amendments
were
first
of
all
refined
the
definition
of
those
who
should
be
compelled
to
work.
interestingly
excluded
all
--
it
excluded
all
mothers
and
children
under
six.
at
that
time,
the
statute
was
also
amended
to
expand
the
range
of
services
available
by
creating
another
separate
administrative
unit
this
time
within
the
department
of
social
services
which
had
as
its
function
the
providing
of
services
designed
to
make
people
ready
for
certification
to
the
department
of
labor
so
that
they
could
take
care
--
take
part
in
the
win
program
and
eventually
be
referred
to
work
or
training.
fourthly,
the
statute
as
--
when
it
was
amended
imposed
a
penalty
on
the
states
for
failure
to
refer
--
to
certify,
now,
that’s
a
second
stage,
failure
to
certify
to
the
department
of
labor
at
least
15%
per
year
of
those
who
had
been
registered
by
the
state
welfare
department
as
being
eligible.
also,
very
importantly,
when
the
statute
was
amended
in
1971,
it
specifically
stated
that
the
registration
requirement
for
those
not
exempt
from
win
was
a
condition
of
eligibility
for
their
receipt
of
assistance.
mr.
dennis
r.
yeager
dealing
with
93%
of
the
recipients
--
mr.
dennis
r.
yeager
that’s
--
that
i
think
those
are
the
numbers
your
honor.
mr.
dennis
r.
yeager
yes,
your
honor,
it
is
--
mr.
dennis
r.
yeager
that’s
correct
your
honor.
the
reason
for
that
was
discussed
and
explained
in
the
district
court
opinion
in
wolford
(ph)
versus
brown
--
mr.
dennis
r.
yeager
yes
your
honor.
there
--
that
congress
authorized
the
secretary
of
labor
to
establish
programs
in
areas
in
which
there
would
be
a
substantial
number
of
welfare
recipients.
areas
in
which
they
felt
the
program
would
do
some
good.
the
secretary
of
labor
has
promulgated
rules
which
state
that
those
programs
are
only
to
be
in
areas
where
there
are
at
least
1100
recipients.
the
way
it
works
is
that
those
individuals
located
in
those
areas
are
not
exempt
from
win
by
virtue
of
the
fact
that
they
are
not
in
an
area
where
a
win
project
has
been
established.
to
find
out
who
is
exempt,
one
must
return
to
the
definition
of
the
exempt.
one
of
which
is
a
person
who
is
too
remote
from
a
win
project
to
be
--
to
participate
effectively
in
the
program.
that
may
obviously
someone’s
near
the
county
line
of
a
county,
he
could
be
closer
than
someone
in
the
county
and
not
be
too
remote.
it’s
just
where
they
physically
locate
the
facilities
is
that
second
provision.
and
very
interestingly
too
when
congress
enacted
that
particular
provision
allowing
the
establishment
of
these
programs
in
less
in
all
of
the
areas,
it
required
the
secretary
of
labor
to
use
his
best
efforts
to
provide
transportation
and
other
things
to
get
the
rest
of
the
individuals,
those
not
in
those
areas
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
dennis
r.
yeager
because
of
the
distance,
precisely.
mr.
dennis
r.
yeager
and
he
might
not
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
dennis
r.
yeager
the
exemption
is
given
to
him
by
the
department
of
social
services,
it
comes
from
the
statute.
the
statute
lists
specifically
those
individuals
--
mr.
dennis
r.
yeager
i
don’t
they
gave
him
a
certificate.
they
just
interview
him
and
do
not
fill
out
the
piece
of
paper
which
is
called
the
registration
paper,
that’s
what
it
comes
down
to.
and
everyone
must
be
registered
unless
exempt.
that
is
a
requirement,
the
states
must
do
that.
i
think
that
raises
an
interesting
point
too
in
connection
with
the
state’s
suggestion
here
that
there
is
a
preference
for
a
win
--
referral
for
the
individuals
under
the
new
york
state
program.
that
kind
of
a
preference
is
really
irrelevant
if
one
examines
the
way
the
federal
statute
operates.
if
you're
exempt
from
the
program,
from
the
work
incentive
program,
what
good
does
it
do
that
person
referred
under
the
state
program
to
be
referred
to
win?
that
person
will
be
told
that
they
can’t
participate.
if
you're
not
exempt
from
the
program,
you're
supposed
to
be
registered
for
win,
registered
for
a
win,
not
registered
for
something
else.
those
individuals
are
yanked
out
of
win
and
placed
in
the
--
whatever
facility,
whatever
service
the
state
has
available
which
could
include
admittedly
employment,
but
are
kept
from
receiving
the
benefits
of
the
federal
program
as
well,
i
might
add
is
the
job
placement
requirements
of
the
federal
program.
that
too
i
think
gets
to
an
interesting
point
which
is
that
under
the
federal
program,
work
referrals
are
not
supposed
to
occur
if
those
work
referrals
would
interfere
with
the
plan
for
the
permanent
rehabilitation
or
self-support
of
the
individual
welfare
recipient.
now
that
seems
a
perfectly
logical
rule.
i
think
that
some
of
the
result
--
that
is
not
a
requirement
of
the
jobs
that
the
difference
in
the
standards
of
the
jobs
to
which
people
are
to
be
referred
under
the
state
program
as
compared
with
the
work
incentive
program
and
one
of
the
results
of
this
is
you
get
situations
such
as
people
being
taken
out
of
college
and
told
to
go
to
work
as
go-go
dancers.
one
other
important
aspect
of
the
1971
amendments
should
be
mentioned
and
that
is
that
those
amendments
also
enacted
as
a
matter
of
statutory
law,
certain
priorities.
unemployed
fathers
and
volunteer
mothers
were
to
be
compelled
to
take
part
in
the
--
the
unemployed
fathers
were
to
be
compelled
and
the
volunteer
mothers
were
to
be
provided
with
the
services.
before
those
services
or
jobs
were
provided
to
other
individuals.
there
are
no
such
priorities
in
the
new
york
state
program
and
the
consequence
of
that
is,
is
really
a
virtual
repeal
of
that
aspect
of
the
federal
law
which
establishes
these
priorities.
congress
has
made
up
--
has
set
up
a
specific
set
of
things
that
it
wants
this
people
to
do.
it
has
established
an
order
in
which
those
things
are
to
be
done.
the
state
ignores
that
order
and
refers
people
directly
to
its
own
program
in
whatever
order
is
available.
after
a
person
has
been
registered
for
the
work
incentive
program,
a
process
of
appraisal
begins
under
the
rules
that
had
been
adopted
by
hew.
the
statute
itself
requires
that
before
a
person
can
be
placed
in
work
or
training,
the
department
of
social
services
must
provide
a
number
of
services,
counseling,
health,
vocation,
rehabilitation,
child
care
and
other
services.
the
federal
government
picks
up
90%
of
the
costs
of
these
services.
those
services
are
designed
to
prepare
the
person
for
certification
as
ready
for
work
or
training.
i
think
an
examination
of
the
budgetary
history
of
the
work
incentive
program
is
useful
if
one
is
to
see
what
the
purposes
of
those
services
really
are
and
how
important
they
have
been
in
the
federal
program.
in
the
fiscal
year
ending,
1969,
congress
appropriated
$117,500,000.00
for
the
work
incentive
program.
in
the
fiscal
year
ending
1972,
that
is
the
last
year
of
the
operation
of
the
program
before
the
1971
amendments,
congress
appropriated
$259,160,000.00
for
the
program.
in
the
proposed
budget,
admittedly
an
austerity
budget
for
fiscal
year
1974,
the
president
has
proposed
$534,434,000.00
for
the
work
incentive
program.
of
that,
$40
million
dollars
is
to
go
for
the
process
of
registration,
this
appraisal
process
that
we
were
discussing,
enrollment,
follow
up
services,
public
service
employment,
$49
million,
on-the-job
training,
$46
million,
institutional
training,
$151,351,000.00,
other
services,
$116,000.00.
these
services
are
real.
i
mean,
they're
provided,
congress
wants
them
to
be
provided
to
work
incentive
program
participants.
but
it's
not
just
services
that
are
provided,
it’s
also
jobs.
congress
did
not
leave
the
question
of
jobs
to
the
operation
of
the
marketplace,
the
way
the
new
york
state
program
does.
congress
specifically
appropriated
money
under
section
6
--
specifically
authorized
the
use
of
appropriated
money
under
section
633
(d)
of
the
act
for
job
placement
services
and
for
job
development
services.
the
on
the
job
training
money
and
the
public
service
employment
money
that
i
just
described
is
money
that
is
used
to
subsidize
employment.
in
addition,
at
the
same
time
of
the
1971
amendments
came
into
effect,
congress
amended
the
internal
revenue
code
to
provide
a
tax
incentive
for
employers
to
employ
win
graduates.
in
other
words,
congress
made
it
very
clear
that
they
did
not
intend
this
to
be
just
a
program
of
social
services.
it
was
a
program
that
was
designed
to
lead
in
an
orderly
fashion
from
a
process
of
registration
of
the
non
exempt
through
a
program
of
providing
services,
child
care,
counseling,
training,
and
eventually
into
a
permanent
job.
the
new
york
program
interferes
with
that
purpose.
under
the
new
york
program,
a
presumption
of
employability
was
established.
in
other
words,
it
was
assumed
that
a
welfare
recipient
was
employable
unless
that
person
could
demonstrate
that
he
or
she
was
not
properly
in
the
work
program.
those
individuals
who
were
found
to
be
employable
were
required
as
we’ve
mentioned
before
to
report
to
the
state
employment
service
to
obtain
a
certificate
that
no
job
is
available
from
the
state
of
employment
service
and
could
be
terminated
for
failure
to
report
to
the
state
employment
service,
failure
to
report
the
results
of
a
job
interview
or
failures
to
report
to
a
job.
notice
that
there
is
a
real
difference
here
between
the
federal
statute
and
the
state
statute.
under
the
federal
statute,
the
presumption
is
that
one
must
register
for
the
services
designed
to
prepare
one
for
work
or
training.
under
the
federal
--
under
the
state
statute,
the
presumption
is
one
of
employability.
direct
job
referral
can
and
often
does
result
from
a
determination
of
employability.
this
means
that
under
the
state
program,
you
leap
from
the
first
step,
non-exemption,
not
being
exempt
from
the
program,
all
the
way
up
to
the
last
step,
job
placement.
one
would
not
expect
the
program
such
as
that
to
result
in
much
successful
permanent
employment
and
in
fact
the
new
york
program
didn't.
more
than
half
of
the
persons
referred
under
the
new
york
work
program
were
separated
from
the
jobs
in
which
they
have
been
placed
at
the
end
of
four
weeks
after
placement.
similarly,
i
think
that
it’s
interesting
to
compare
the
statistics
on
the
numbers
of
individuals
who
are
actually
placed
with
those
who
were
terminated
for
--
not
terminated
because
they
had
received
income,
but
terminated
because
they
had
found
to
be
--
to
have
--
they
were
found
to
have
failed
to
comply
with
the
requirements
of
the
state
program.
2000
--
in
july
1971,
there
were
2,361
job
placements
under
the
new
york
program.
5,265
individuals
were
terminated.in
august
of
‘71,
4,574
placements,
4,379
individuals
terminated.
september
1971,
4,378
terminations,
4,269
individuals
placed.
that
appears
again
in
the
hew
department
of
labor
study
to
which
we
refer
to
in
our
brief.
there's
one
other
aspect
of
conflict
between
the
new
york
work
program
and
the
work
incentive
program
and
that’s
one
that’s
extremely
important.
the
conflict
between
the
procedures
that
are
used
under
the
new
york
program
and
the
sanction
as
opposed
to
the
procedures
and
sanction
that
are
used
under
the
work
incentive
program.
in
new
york,
there
are
basically
two
ways
for
one
to
obtain
a
hearing
on
whether
or
not
one
is
out
of
compliance
with
the
work
rules.
first
of
all
--
there
are
two
ways
to
obtain
a
hearing
on
the
correctness
of
the
determination
if
one
is
employable.
first
of
all,
one
can
comply
and
however
hard
that
is,
await
the
holding
of
a
hearing.
secondly,
one
cannot
comply
and
risk
termination
of
benefits
for
30
days.
mr.
dennis
r.
yeager
yes.
mr.
dennis
r.
yeager
precisely.
mr.
dennis
r.
yeager
yes
your
honor,
that’s
exactly
right.
mr.
dennis
r.
yeager
if
they
didn’t
take
the
job.
mr.
dennis
r.
yeager
if
they
didn’t
take
the
job.
mr.
dennis
r.
yeager
instance,
well,
your
honor,
most
of
the
people
with
whom
we’ve
dealt
in
the
record,
we
see
all
of
them
got
temporary
restraining
orders.
they
were
engaged
in
that
process
at
the
time
that
the
temporary
restraining
orders
came
up.
there
were
of
course
a
number
of
terminations.
there
were
--
i’m
not
--
i
just
don’t
know
the
answer,
[attempt
to
laughter]
i
guess
it’s
what
it
comes
down
to.
i
think
though
that
this
does
bring
out
another
point
which
is
that
new
york
applies
--
new
york
does
apply
its
30-day
penalty
to
an
individual
who
refuses
to
take
part
in
the
work
incentive
program.
if
you
refuse
to
take
part
in
the
work
incentive
program
under
federal
law,
you're
supposed
to
be
terminated
from
benefits
only
if
and
so
long
as
you
do
not
comply.
once
you
make
a
decision
that
you
will
comply,
you
are
allowed
to
receive
your
benefits
again.
but
new
york
applies
its
30-day
disqualification
not
only
to
people
who
fail
to
comply
with
the
new
york
work
rules,
but
also
applies
that
30-day
disqualification
under
its
regulations
to
individuals,
who
declined
to
participate
in
the
work
incentive
program.
presumably,
they
apply
a
whole
new
set
of
standard
at
that
point
when
they
make
the
decision
about
what
--
about
the
--
whether
or
not
to
impose
a
30-day
requirement.
under
the
federal
program,
the
procedures
of
course
differ.
first
of
all,
one
is
entitled
--
mr.
dennis
r.
yeager
that
would
be
right
your
honor.
that
would
be
right.
it’s
the
timing
of
that
that
is
of
concern.
you
get
the
fair
hearing
while
--
if
you
don’t
want
to
risk
your
grant,
you
must
comply
while
you
await
the
fair
hearing.
mr.
dennis
r.
yeager
go
to
the
job
or
pick
your
check.
that
of
course
could
be
a
considerable
hardship
for
the
mother
--
mr.
dennis
r.
yeager
yes.
mr.
dennis
r.
yeager
federal.
mr.
dennis
r.
yeager
as
part
of
this
preceding
your
honor.
mr.
dennis
r.
yeager
yes,
she
got
a
temporary
restraining
order
in
this
proceeding.
i
--
mr.
dennis
r.
yeager
no
your
honor,
i
don’t
think
it
would
be
for
a
temporary
restraining
order.
secondly,
the
other
way
to
get
the
hearing
is
to
finish
with
that
--
the
response
to
the
question
is
that
you
can
fail
to
comply,
but
that
involves
considerable
risk
cause
these
are
very
subjective
judgments.
is
this
adequate
childcare?
is
this
job
a
good
job?
is
this
a
job
i
can
perform?
am
i
healthy?
in
--
there's
a
very
subjective
elements
that
go
into
these
decisions.
i
think
the
situation
of
say
a
mother
who
is
confronted
with
the
fact
that
she
doesn’t
care
for
the
childcare
service
that
has
been
provided
her
and
she
doesn’t
think
it’s
adequate,
she
is
obviously
in
conflict
with
the
administration.
that
should
be
resolved
before
she’s
compelled
to
comply.
finally,
in
conclusion,
i
think
that
what
we’ve
--
what
we
really
see
here
is
that
there
is
a
federal
program
which
tells
what
the
condition
of
eligibility
for
afdc
is
insofar
as
there
is
any
work
condition
of
eligibility.
the
federal
government
repealed
the
authorization
to
the
states
to
use
other
kinds
of
programs
at
the
time
that
that
it
enacted
the
work
incentive
program
and
the
legislative
history
makes
it
very
clear
that
the
individuals
were
to
be
--
who
were
covered
were
all
individuals.
you
are
either
exempt
or
you
are
not
exempt.
the
exempt
were
not
supposed
to
be
compelled
to
work.
the
nonexempt
were
supposed
to
be
compelled
if
need
be
to
take
part
in
the
work
incentive
program.
in
addition,
the
evidence
of
preemptive
intent
is
overwhelming.
this
is
not
a
question
of
the
perfection
of
the
new
york
--
of
the
federal
program.
if
perfection
were
one
of
the
criteria
for
preemption,
then
i
suppose
there
would
be
no
doctrine
of
preemption,
human
fallibility
being
what
it
is.
we’re
talking
here
about
a
federal
program
which
is
very
substantial
which
the
statute
on
its
face
covers
all
of
the
individuals
who
could
be
covered,
dividing
them
into
the
categories
into
those
who
must
participate
and
those
who
must
not
participate
and
a
very
elaborate
and
expensive
program
has
been
established
by
congress.
mr.
dennis
r.
yeager
your
honor,
that
would
be
covered
by
a
preemption.
the
individuals
who
are
so
remote
from
the
program
because
there
is
not
a
program
located
in
their
state
would
be
--
in
their
area
would
exempt.
the
individuals
who
were
located
close
enough
to
participate
regardless
of
whether
that
win
program
were
--
was
in
their
county
or
in
their
city
or
wherever
it
might
be
would
not
be
exempt
and
they
would
be
compelled
to
comply
with
the
federal
program.
in
other
words,
congress
dealt
with
that
very
specific
point
and
ruled
that
nonresidents
or
residents
in
an
area
which
was
not
a
win
area
was
not
an
exemption
from
the
program.
mr.
dennis
r.
yeager
your
honor,
that
might
be
true
geographically,
but
93%
of
the
welfare,
afdc
recipients
in
the
state
of
new
york
are
located
in
the
win
areas.
now,
in
addition
to
that,
there
would
be
individuals
not
located
in
win
areas
who
would
not
be
too
remote
from
the
program
who
would
also
have
to
participate.
so,
it’s
a
very
high
percentage
of
the
welfare
recipients
that
are
covered.
i
think
the
remoteness
requirement
indicates
very
definitely
that
congress
took
that
into
consideration.
mr.
dennis
r.
yeager
your
honor,
it
would
be
our
position
that
there
would
still
have
been
jurisdiction
in
the
court
at
that
time
under
the
cases
holding
that
1343
(3)
gives
the
court
--
1343
(4)
gives
the
federal
court’s
jurisdiction
to
review
federal
state
conformity
with
federal
statutes.
i
believe
though
that
--
mr.
dennis
r.
yeager
no
your
honor,
i
think
what
we
would
contend
--
well,
i
might
--
we
might
contend
that
but
i
think
the
first
thing
we
would
contend
would
be
the
section
1983
for
it
protects
federal
rights
for
citizens.
and
that
that
is
a
statute
which
would
bring
the
social
security
act
into
play
in
the
federal
court
and
in
turn,
you
would
have
jurisdiction
because
1983
is
a
statute
covered
by
1343
(4).
i
think
there
was
a
substantial
question
below
your
honor
for
two
reasons;
number
one,
we
won
on
one
of
those
questions,
the
due
process
question.
and
number
two,
on
a
very
similar
question,
the
fair
hearing
question,
the
second
circuit
recently
continued
a
preliminary
injunction
on
this
30-day
penalty
requirement
that
had
been
issued
by
a
district
court
judge.
mr.
dennis
r.
yeager
well,
your
honor,
that
1983
provides
a
remedy
for
the
deprivation
of
federal
rights.
mr.
dennis
r.
yeager
well,
your
honor,
1983
doesn’t
require
a
three-judge
court
but
a
statue,
this
--
as
i’m
saying
here,
the
--
oh,
i’m
sorry,
okay,
i
have
missed
that
point.
on
that
point,
you're
right,
i
didn’t
--
wouldn’t
be
a
three-judge
court,
i
thought
justice
--
mr.
dennis
r.
yeager
your
honor,
i’m
sorry,
i
thought
justice
rehnquist
was
asking
me
if
the
single
judge
would
still
have
jurisdiction
but
that
was
a
question
to
which
i
was
trying
to
address
myself.
as
to
that
question,
i
think
it’s
been
unresolved
at
this
point.
they
can
--
in
some
of
the
cases,
the
district
courts
have
been
continuing
to
set
as
three-judge
courts
to
deal
with
the
statutory
question
because
there
was
a
substantial
federal
constitutional
question.
certainly,
this
court
in
rosado
v.
wyman
held
that
the
single
judge
--
court
could
retain
jurisdiction
if
there
were
a
substantial
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
dennis
r.
yeager
if
the
three-judge
court
could
not.
mr.
dennis
r.
yeager
yes.
mr.
dennis
r.
yeager
are
there
further
questions?
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
dennis
r.
yeager
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
does
not
involve
a
question
of
the
perfection
of
the
federal
work
incentive
program.
in
1967,
congress
enacted
for
the
first
time
a
compulsory
work
program
for
all
afdc
recipients
which
it
required
each
of
the
states
to
include
in
its
plan
of
aid
to
families
with
dependent
children.
when
it
enacted
that
program,
it
described
the
program
in
the
introductory
statutory
material
as
being
designed
to
cultivate
in
individuals
the
sense
of
dignity,
self-worth
and
confidence
that
flows
from
being
a
wage
earning
member
of
society.
in
1971,
the
state
of
new
york
elected
to
enact
its
own
compulsory
work
program
applicable
also
to
afdc
recipients
which
established
the
presumption
of
employability
for
such
recipients
and
which
was
designed
to
and
to
a
certain
extent
did
achieve
maximum
welfare
role
reductions.
one
administrator
in
the
state
of
new
york
characterized
the
results
under
the
program
as
follows.
“last
month,
the
weekend
of
october
5,
we
closed
a
hundred
cases.
i
haven’t
really
gotten
to
closing
codes
for
all
of
these
cases.
i
would
think
that
the
employment
section
is
having
a
greater
impact
on
the
right
of
closing.
we
are
closing
a
very
great
proportion
of
cases
on
the
basis
of
failure
to
comply
on
the
employment
procedures.
that
seems
to
be
reflective
of
a
somewhat
different
purpose
than
the
purpose
which
congress
had
in
mind
when
it
enacted
the
statute
designed
to
cultivate
a
sense
of
dignity,
self-worth
and
confidence.”
it’s
also
worthy
of
note
that
that
quotation
is
not
exceptional
--
mr.
dennis
r.
yeager
closing
cases?
well,
your
honor,
in
a
study
that
was
done
by
the
department
of
health,
education,
and
welfare
and
the
department
of
labor
of
the
administration
of
this
program
in
the
state
of
new
york,
it
was
found
that
what
they
were
--
i’m
sorry,
not
an
--
it
wasn’t
a
study,
excuse
me,
in
a
--
in
the
stipulation
to
fact
in
the
case,
it
appears
that
approximately
11,000
jobs
were
found
while
approximately
13,000
case
closings
occurred
as
the
result
of
failures
to
comply
not
as
the
result
--
mr.
dennis
r.
yeager
terminating
benefits.
and
now
--
mr.
dennis
r.
yeager
completely.
that’s
correct
your
honor.
except
--
that
is
as
to
the
individual
who
is
refusing
to
take
part.
if
there's
some
other
individual
in
the
family
who
is
still
eligible
for
afdc,
they
would
continue
to
receive
their
share
of
the
benefits.
mr.
dennis
r.
yeager
that’s
correct
your
honor.
mr.
dennis
r.
yeager
that
would
be
correct.
some
of
those
would
be
attributable
to
failure
to
come
and
pick
up
their
check
and
that
could
mean
that
there
was
a
very
substantial
hardship
amounting
almost
to
impossibility
for
some
people
to
pick
up
those
checks.
mr.
dennis
r.
yeager
the
purpose
--
mr.
dennis
r.
yeager
--
was
characterized
by
hew
as
possible
harassment
in
a
letter,
exhibit
16
in
the
case.
the
purpose
also
i
think
was
rather
un
--
specifically
applied
because
the
study
to
which
i
inadvertently
referred
a
moment
ago,
the
hew
dol
study
found
that
some
67%
of
the
people
who
claimed
that
they
were
not
employable;
i.e.
should
not
be
required
to
report
--
mr.
dennis
r.
yeager
--
were
incorrectly
characterized
as
people
who
should
report.
mr.
dennis
r.
yeager
your
honor,
i’m
not
sure
that
that
was
ever
explicitly
stated
by
the
governor
when
he
introduced
the
legislation
in
the
state.
i
take
it
that
it
was
part
of
the
purpose,
overall
purpose
of
securing
a
checkup
on
whether
or
not
individuals
were
employable.
the
statute
required
that
the
individual
obtain
a
certificate
from
the
state
employment
service
semimonthly
that
there
is
no
job
available
for
that
person.
that
was
one
of
the
purposes
certainly
to
discharge
a
require
--
that
particular
requirement
of
the
statute.
mr.
dennis
r.
yeager
your
honor,
it
would
be
a
means
of
doing
that,
but
i
think
the
purpose
of
the
statute
as
stated
by
new
york
when
it
was
enacted
was
to
provide
for
employability
of
welfare
recipients.
mr.
dennis
r.
yeager
i
don’t
think
the
purpose
was
stated
to
be
that
by
the
governor
when
he
introduced
it.
mi
mean
it
would
have
that
effect.
i
mean,
it
would
have
that
effect.
mr.
dennis
r.
yeager
i’m
sure
that
that
isn’t
the
case
in
the
problem
your
honor.
i
think
hew
--
mr.
dennis
r.
yeager
yes.
i
think
hew
does
suggest
in
its
manual
that
the
most
appropriate
method
for
delivering
checks
to
individuals
is
through
the
mail.
i
think
that
the
requirement
as
it
was
enacted
in
the
state
of
new
york
was
really
one
related
to
those
employability
requirements.
interestingly,
you
know,
the
state
of
new
york
did
have
a
residence
requirement
which
they
enacted
at
the
same
time
which
was
held
to
be
unconstitutional.
and
that
particular
requirement
presumably
would’ve
been
in
the
place
in
which
the
state
would’ve
enacted
a
requirement
that
was
specifically
addressed
to
the
problem
of
dual
residency.
that
was
enacted
at
the
same
time
as
a
work
program.
four
district
courts
and
one
circuit
court
of
appeals
have
reached
the
conclusion
that
the
compulsory
work
program
established
by
congress
has
precluded
the
states
from
enacting
similar
compulsory
work
programs.
those
decisions
for
a
right
on
three
separate
grounds
in
this
particular
case.
first
of
all,
they
were
right
because
the
federal
government
has
preempted
the
state
activity
in
this
area.
secondly,
the
decisions
were
right
because
the
work
rules
constituted
additional
conditions
of
ineligibility.
thirdly,
they
were
right
as
applied
to
this
particular
case
because
the
new
york
statute
is
in
conflict
with
the
federal
statute
at
so
many
points.
in
1935,
congress
enacted
the
social
security
act.
the
president’s
message
which
conveyed
that
act
to
the
congress
included
within
it
a
suggestion
of
a
program
for
aid
to
widowed
and
otherwise,
separated
mothers.
that
program
according
to
the
message
was
“designed
to
release
from
the
wage
earning
role
the
person
whose
natural
function
is
to
give
her
children
the
physical
and
mental
guardianship
necessary.”
in
other
words,
the
program
was
designed
to
be
for
people
whom
congress
had
made
a
judgment
should
not
be
employed
outside
the
home.
secondly,
in
1961,
congress
amended
the
social
security
act.
for
the
first
time,
it
included
in
the
coverage
of
the
act,
children
in
homes
in
which
a
breadwinner
was
present.
as
part
of
that
act
and
for
the
first
time,
congress
imposed
a
requirement
that
the
breadwinner
accept
jobs
to
which
he
would
be
referred
and
report
to
the
state
employment
service.
that
is
the
first
time
that
we
find
a
requirement
of
compulsory
work
in
the
federal
afdc
program.
in
1962,
congress
then
enacted
a
com
–
a
different
compulsory
program
known
as
the
community
work
and
training
program.
the
legislative
history
of
that
program
is
set
out
in
the
brief
submitted
by
the
national
welfare
rights
organization
as
amicus
curiae
indicates
that
that
program
was
still
to
be
primarily
for
those
fathers
who
were
in
the
afdcu
program,
the
breadwinners.
however,
and
most
importantly,
when
working
--
when
work
incentive
program
was
enacted
in
1967,
both
of
those
programs
were
repealed
and
replaced
by
requirements
that
states
have
work
incentive
programs.
the
community
work
and
training
program
was
completely
repealed.
the
requirement
in
the
afdcu
program
that
fathers
accept
work
to
which
they
were
referred
was
repealed
and
replaced
by
a
requirement
that
the
state’s
put
all
such
fathers
in
the
work
incentive
program
within
30
days
of
their
eligibility
for
afdcu
benefits.
what
the
work
incentive
program
did
was
it
identified
those
individuals
who
in
the
judgment
of
congress
were
appropriate
for
compulsory
work
or
training.
it
also
identified
those
individuals
by
--
those
individuals
who
were
inappropriate
for
compulsory
work
or
training.
thirdly,
it
established
an
elaborate
program
of
job
placement
and
training
for
appropriate
individuals
and
volunteers.
fourthly
and
very
importantly,
it
established
--
it
authorized
the
establishment
of
a
separate
administrative
agency
which
would
handle
the
work
incentive
program.
and
different
individuals
in
the
state
employment
service
do
in
fact
operate
the
work
incentive
program
from
those
individuals
who
operate
the
normal
state
employment
service
referrals.
fifthly,
to
repeat,
the
work
incentive
program
repealed
--
mr.
dennis
r.
yeager
your
honor,
i
believe
that,
if
i
recall
--
mr.
dennis
r.
yeager
i
thought
that
you
said
the
same
offices
did
your
honor.
i
--
it
might
be
that
my
recollection
is
incorrect,
but
these
people
are
located
in
the
same
building.
mr.
dennis
r.
yeager
they're
different
personnel.
the
department
of
labor
and
its
working
center
program
manual
lists
ten
separate
job
titles
--
mr.
dennis
r.
yeager
no,
i’m
sorry
your
honor.
mr.
dennis
r.
yeager
the
federal
department
of
labor
that
administers
the
work
incentive
program
--
mr.
dennis
r.
yeager
--
lists
ten
different
job
titles
which
it
considers
essential
to
the
operation
of
the
work
incentive
program.
in
1971,
there
were
further
amendments
to
the
work
incentive
program
and
those
amendments
were
first
of
all
refined
the
definition
of
those
who
should
be
compelled
to
work.
interestingly
excluded
all
--
it
excluded
all
mothers
and
children
under
six.
at
that
time,
the
statute
was
also
amended
to
expand
the
range
of
services
available
by
creating
another
separate
administrative
unit
this
time
within
the
department
of
social
services
which
had
as
its
function
the
providing
of
services
designed
to
make
people
ready
for
certification
to
the
department
of
labor
so
that
they
could
take
care
--
take
part
in
the
win
program
and
eventually
be
referred
to
work
or
training.
fourthly,
the
statute
as
--
when
it
was
amended
imposed
a
penalty
on
the
states
for
failure
to
refer
--
to
certify,
now,
that’s
a
second
stage,
failure
to
certify
to
the
department
of
labor
at
least
15%
per
year
of
those
who
had
been
registered
by
the
state
welfare
department
as
being
eligible.
also,
very
importantly,
when
the
statute
was
amended
in
1971,
it
specifically
stated
that
the
registration
requirement
for
those
not
exempt
from
win
was
a
condition
of
eligibility
for
their
receipt
of
assistance.
mr.
dennis
r.
yeager
dealing
with
93%
of
the
recipients
--
mr.
dennis
r.
yeager
that’s
--
that
i
think
those
are
the
numbers
your
honor.
mr.
dennis
r.
yeager
yes,
your
honor,
it
is
--
mr.
dennis
r.
yeager
that’s
correct
your
honor.
the
reason
for
that
was
discussed
and
explained
in
the
district
court
opinion
in
wolford
(ph)
versus
brown
--
mr.
dennis
r.
yeager
yes
your
honor.
there
--
that
congress
authorized
the
secretary
of
labor
to
establish
programs
in
areas
in
which
there
would
be
a
substantial
number
of
welfare
recipients.
areas
in
which
they
felt
the
program
would
do
some
good.
the
secretary
of
labor
has
promulgated
rules
which
state
that
those
programs
are
only
to
be
in
areas
where
there
are
at
least
1100
recipients.
the
way
it
works
is
that
those
individuals
located
in
those
areas
are
not
exempt
from
win
by
virtue
of
the
fact
that
they
are
not
in
an
area
where
a
win
project
has
been
established.
to
find
out
who
is
exempt,
one
must
return
to
the
definition
of
the
exempt.
one
of
which
is
a
person
who
is
too
remote
from
a
win
project
to
be
--
to
participate
effectively
in
the
program.
that
may
obviously
someone’s
near
the
county
line
of
a
county,
he
could
be
closer
than
someone
in
the
county
and
not
be
too
remote.
it’s
just
where
they
physically
locate
the
facilities
is
that
second
provision.
and
very
interestingly
too
when
congress
enacted
that
particular
provision
allowing
the
establishment
of
these
programs
in
less
in
all
of
the
areas,
it
required
the
secretary
of
labor
to
use
his
best
efforts
to
provide
transportation
and
other
things
to
get
the
rest
of
the
individuals,
those
not
in
those
areas
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
dennis
r.
yeager
because
of
the
distance,
precisely.
mr.
dennis
r.
yeager
and
he
might
not
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
dennis
r.
yeager
the
exemption
is
given
to
him
by
the
department
of
social
services,
it
comes
from
the
statute.
the
statute
lists
specifically
those
individuals
--
mr.
dennis
r.
yeager
i
don’t
they
gave
him
a
certificate.
they
just
interview
him
and
do
not
fill
out
the
piece
of
paper
which
is
called
the
registration
paper,
that’s
what
it
comes
down
to.
and
everyone
must
be
registered
unless
exempt.
that
is
a
requirement,
the
states
must
do
that.
i
think
that
raises
an
interesting
point
too
in
connection
with
the
state’s
suggestion
here
that
there
is
a
preference
for
a
win
--
referral
for
the
individuals
under
the
new
york
state
program.
that
kind
of
a
preference
is
really
irrelevant
if
one
examines
the
way
the
federal
statute
operates.
if
you're
exempt
from
the
program,
from
the
work
incentive
program,
what
good
does
it
do
that
person
referred
under
the
state
program
to
be
referred
to
win?
that
person
will
be
told
that
they
can’t
participate.
if
you're
not
exempt
from
the
program,
you're
supposed
to
be
registered
for
win,
registered
for
a
win,
not
registered
for
something
else.
those
individuals
are
yanked
out
of
win
and
placed
in
the
--
whatever
facility,
whatever
service
the
state
has
available
which
could
include
admittedly
employment,
but
are
kept
from
receiving
the
benefits
of
the
federal
program
as
well,
i
might
add
is
the
job
placement
requirements
of
the
federal
program.
that
too
i
think
gets
to
an
interesting
point
which
is
that
under
the
federal
program,
work
referrals
are
not
supposed
to
occur
if
those
work
referrals
would
interfere
with
the
plan
for
the
permanent
rehabilitation
or
self-support
of
the
individual
welfare
recipient.
now
that
seems
a
perfectly
logical
rule.
i
think
that
some
of
the
result
--
that
is
not
a
requirement
of
the
jobs
that
the
difference
in
the
standards
of
the
jobs
to
which
people
are
to
be
referred
under
the
state
program
as
compared
with
the
work
incentive
program
and
one
of
the
results
of
this
is
you
get
situations
such
as
people
being
taken
out
of
college
and
told
to
go
to
work
as
go-go
dancers.
one
other
important
aspect
of
the
1971
amendments
should
be
mentioned
and
that
is
that
those
amendments
also
enacted
as
a
matter
of
statutory
law,
certain
priorities.
unemployed
fathers
and
volunteer
mothers
were
to
be
compelled
to
take
part
in
the
--
the
unemployed
fathers
were
to
be
compelled
and
the
volunteer
mothers
were
to
be
provided
with
the
services.
before
those
services
or
jobs
were
provided
to
other
individuals.
there
are
no
such
priorities
in
the
new
york
state
program
and
the
consequence
of
that
is,
is
really
a
virtual
repeal
of
that
aspect
of
the
federal
law
which
establishes
these
priorities.
congress
has
made
up
--
has
set
up
a
specific
set
of
things
that
it
wants
this
people
to
do.
it
has
established
an
order
in
which
those
things
are
to
be
done.
the
state
ignores
that
order
and
refers
people
directly
to
its
own
program
in
whatever
order
is
available.
after
a
person
has
been
registered
for
the
work
incentive
program,
a
process
of
appraisal
begins
under
the
rules
that
had
been
adopted
by
hew.
the
statute
itself
requires
that
before
a
person
can
be
placed
in
work
or
training,
the
department
of
social
services
must
provide
a
number
of
services,
counseling,
health,
vocation,
rehabilitation,
child
care
and
other
services.
the
federal
government
picks
up
90%
of
the
costs
of
these
services.
those
services
are
designed
to
prepare
the
person
for
certification
as
ready
for
work
or
training.
i
think
an
examination
of
the
budgetary
history
of
the
work
incentive
program
is
useful
if
one
is
to
see
what
the
purposes
of
those
services
really
are
and
how
important
they
have
been
in
the
federal
program.
in
the
fiscal
year
ending,
1969,
congress
appropriated
$117,500,000.00
for
the
work
incentive
program.
in
the
fiscal
year
ending
1972,
that
is
the
last
year
of
the
operation
of
the
program
before
the
1971
amendments,
congress
appropriated
$259,160,000.00
for
the
program.
in
the
proposed
budget,
admittedly
an
austerity
budget
for
fiscal
year
1974,
the
president
has
proposed
$534,434,000.00
for
the
work
incentive
program.
of
that,
$40
million
dollars
is
to
go
for
the
process
of
registration,
this
appraisal
process
that
we
were
discussing,
enrollment,
follow
up
services,
public
service
employment,
$49
million,
on-the-job
training,
$46
million,
institutional
training,
$151,351,000.00,
other
services,
$116,000.00.
these
services
are
real.
i
mean,
they're
provided,
congress
wants
them
to
be
provided
to
work
incentive
program
participants.
but
it's
not
just
services
that
are
provided,
it’s
also
jobs.
congress
did
not
leave
the
question
of
jobs
to
the
operation
of
the
marketplace,
the
way
the
new
york
state
program
does.
congress
specifically
appropriated
money
under
section
6
--
specifically
authorized
the
use
of
appropriated
money
under
section
633
(d)
of
the
act
for
job
placement
services
and
for
job
development
services.
the
on
the
job
training
money
and
the
public
service
employment
money
that
i
just
described
is
money
that
is
used
to
subsidize
employment.
in
addition,
at
the
same
time
of
the
1971
amendments
came
into
effect,
congress
amended
the
internal
revenue
code
to
provide
a
tax
incentive
for
employers
to
employ
win
graduates.
in
other
words,
congress
made
it
very
clear
that
they
did
not
intend
this
to
be
just
a
program
of
social
services.
it
was
a
program
that
was
designed
to
lead
in
an
orderly
fashion
from
a
process
of
registration
of
the
non
exempt
through
a
program
of
providing
services,
child
care,
counseling,
training,
and
eventually
into
a
permanent
job.
the
new
york
program
interferes
with
that
purpose.
under
the
new
york
program,
a
presumption
of
employability
was
established.
in
other
words,
it
was
assumed
that
a
welfare
recipient
was
employable
unless
that
person
could
demonstrate
that
he
or
she
was
not
properly
in
the
work
program.
those
individuals
who
were
found
to
be
employable
were
required
as
we’ve
mentioned
before
to
report
to
the
state
employment
service
to
obtain
a
certificate
that
no
job
is
available
from
the
state
of
employment
service
and
could
be
terminated
for
failure
to
report
to
the
state
employment
service,
failure
to
report
the
results
of
a
job
interview
or
failures
to
report
to
a
job.
notice
that
there
is
a
real
difference
here
between
the
federal
statute
and
the
state
statute.
under
the
federal
statute,
the
presumption
is
that
one
must
register
for
the
services
designed
to
prepare
one
for
work
or
training.
under
the
federal
--
under
the
state
statute,
the
presumption
is
one
of
employability.
direct
job
referral
can
and
often
does
result
from
a
determination
of
employability.
this
means
that
under
the
state
program,
you
leap
from
the
first
step,
non-exemption,
not
being
exempt
from
the
program,
all
the
way
up
to
the
last
step,
job
placement.
one
would
not
expect
the
program
such
as
that
to
result
in
much
successful
permanent
employment
and
in
fact
the
new
york
program
didn't.
more
than
half
of
the
persons
referred
under
the
new
york
work
program
were
separated
from
the
jobs
in
which
they
have
been
placed
at
the
end
of
four
weeks
after
placement.
similarly,
i
think
that
it’s
interesting
to
compare
the
statistics
on
the
numbers
of
individuals
who
are
actually
placed
with
those
who
were
terminated
for
--
not
terminated
because
they
had
received
income,
but
terminated
because
they
had
found
to
be
--
to
have
--
they
were
found
to
have
failed
to
comply
with
the
requirements
of
the
state
program.
2000
--
in
july
1971,
there
were
2,361
job
placements
under
the
new
york
program.
5,265
individuals
were
terminated.in
august
of
‘71,
4,574
placements,
4,379
individuals
terminated.
september
1971,
4,378
terminations,
4,269
individuals
placed.
that
appears
again
in
the
hew
department
of
labor
study
to
which
we
refer
to
in
our
brief.
there's
one
other
aspect
of
conflict
between
the
new
york
work
program
and
the
work
incentive
program
and
that’s
one
that’s
extremely
important.
the
conflict
between
the
procedures
that
are
used
under
the
new
york
program
and
the
sanction
as
opposed
to
the
procedures
and
sanction
that
are
used
under
the
work
incentive
program.
in
new
york,
there
are
basically
two
ways
for
one
to
obtain
a
hearing
on
whether
or
not
one
is
out
of
compliance
with
the
work
rules.
first
of
all
--
there
are
two
ways
to
obtain
a
hearing
on
the
correctness
of
the
determination
if
one
is
employable.
first
of
all,
one
can
comply
and
however
hard
that
is,
await
the
holding
of
a
hearing.
secondly,
one
cannot
comply
and
risk
termination
of
benefits
for
30
days.
mr.
dennis
r.
yeager
yes.
mr.
dennis
r.
yeager
precisely.
mr.
dennis
r.
yeager
yes
your
honor,
that’s
exactly
right.
mr.
dennis
r.
yeager
if
they
didn’t
take
the
job.
mr.
dennis
r.
yeager
if
they
didn’t
take
the
job.
mr.
dennis
r.
yeager
instance,
well,
your
honor,
most
of
the
people
with
whom
we’ve
dealt
in
the
record,
we
see
all
of
them
got
temporary
restraining
orders.
they
were
engaged
in
that
process
at
the
time
that
the
temporary
restraining
orders
came
up.
there
were
of
course
a
number
of
terminations.
there
were
--
i’m
not
--
i
just
don’t
know
the
answer,
[attempt
to
laughter]
i
guess
it’s
what
it
comes
down
to.
i
think
though
that
this
does
bring
out
another
point
which
is
that
new
york
applies
--
new
york
does
apply
its
30-day
penalty
to
an
individual
who
refuses
to
take
part
in
the
work
incentive
program.
if
you
refuse
to
take
part
in
the
work
incentive
program
under
federal
law,
you're
supposed
to
be
terminated
from
benefits
only
if
and
so
long
as
you
do
not
comply.
once
you
make
a
decision
that
you
will
comply,
you
are
allowed
to
receive
your
benefits
again.
but
new
york
applies
its
30-day
disqualification
not
only
to
people
who
fail
to
comply
with
the
new
york
work
rules,
but
also
applies
that
30-day
disqualification
under
its
regulations
to
individuals,
who
declined
to
participate
in
the
work
incentive
program.
presumably,
they
apply
a
whole
new
set
of
standard
at
that
point
when
they
make
the
decision
about
what
--
about
the
--
whether
or
not
to
impose
a
30-day
requirement.
under
the
federal
program,
the
procedures
of
course
differ.
first
of
all,
one
is
entitled
--
mr.
dennis
r.
yeager
that
would
be
right
your
honor.
that
would
be
right.
it’s
the
timing
of
that
that
is
of
concern.
you
get
the
fair
hearing
while
--
if
you
don’t
want
to
risk
your
grant,
you
must
comply
while
you
await
the
fair
hearing.
mr.
dennis
r.
yeager
go
to
the
job
or
pick
your
check.
that
of
course
could
be
a
considerable
hardship
for
the
mother
--
mr.
dennis
r.
yeager
yes.
mr.
dennis
r.
yeager
federal.
mr.
dennis
r.
yeager
as
part
of
this
preceding
your
honor.
mr.
dennis
r.
yeager
yes,
she
got
a
temporary
restraining
order
in
this
proceeding.
i
--
mr.
dennis
r.
yeager
no
your
honor,
i
don’t
think
it
would
be
for
a
temporary
restraining
order.
secondly,
the
other
way
to
get
the
hearing
is
to
finish
with
that
--
the
response
to
the
question
is
that
you
can
fail
to
comply,
but
that
involves
considerable
risk
cause
these
are
very
subjective
judgments.
is
this
adequate
childcare?
is
this
job
a
good
job?
is
this
a
job
i
can
perform?
am
i
healthy?
in
--
there's
a
very
subjective
elements
that
go
into
these
decisions.
i
think
the
situation
of
say
a
mother
who
is
confronted
with
the
fact
that
she
doesn’t
care
for
the
childcare
service
that
has
been
provided
her
and
she
doesn’t
think
it’s
adequate,
she
is
obviously
in
conflict
with
the
administration.
that
should
be
resolved
before
she’s
compelled
to
comply.
finally,
in
conclusion,
i
think
that
what
we’ve
--
what
we
really
see
here
is
that
there
is
a
federal
program
which
tells
what
the
condition
of
eligibility
for
afdc
is
insofar
as
there
is
any
work
condition
of
eligibility.
the
federal
government
repealed
the
authorization
to
the
states
to
use
other
kinds
of
programs
at
the
time
that
that
it
enacted
the
work
incentive
program
and
the
legislative
history
makes
it
very
clear
that
the
individuals
were
to
be
--
who
were
covered
were
all
individuals.
you
are
either
exempt
or
you
are
not
exempt.
the
exempt
were
not
supposed
to
be
compelled
to
work.
the
nonexempt
were
supposed
to
be
compelled
if
need
be
to
take
part
in
the
work
incentive
program.
in
addition,
the
evidence
of
preemptive
intent
is
overwhelming.
this
is
not
a
question
of
the
perfection
of
the
new
york
--
of
the
federal
program.
if
perfection
were
one
of
the
criteria
for
preemption,
then
i
suppose
there
would
be
no
doctrine
of
preemption,
human
fallibility
being
what
it
is.
we’re
talking
here
about
a
federal
program
which
is
very
substantial
which
the
statute
on
its
face
covers
all
of
the
individuals
who
could
be
covered,
dividing
them
into
the
categories
into
those
who
must
participate
and
those
who
must
not
participate
and
a
very
elaborate
and
expensive
program
has
been
established
by
congress.
mr.
dennis
r.
yeager
your
honor,
that
would
be
covered
by
a
preemption.
the
individuals
who
are
so
remote
from
the
program
because
there
is
not
a
program
located
in
their
state
would
be
--
in
their
area
would
exempt.
the
individuals
who
were
located
close
enough
to
participate
regardless
of
whether
that
win
program
were
--
was
in
their
county
or
in
their
city
or
wherever
it
might
be
would
not
be
exempt
and
they
would
be
compelled
to
comply
with
the
federal
program.
in
other
words,
congress
dealt
with
that
very
specific
point
and
ruled
that
nonresidents
or
residents
in
an
area
which
was
not
a
win
area
was
not
an
exemption
from
the
program.
mr.
dennis
r.
yeager
your
honor,
that
might
be
true
geographically,
but
93%
of
the
welfare,
afdc
recipients
in
the
state
of
new
york
are
located
in
the
win
areas.
now,
in
addition
to
that,
there
would
be
individuals
not
located
in
win
areas
who
would
not
be
too
remote
from
the
program
who
would
also
have
to
participate.
so,
it’s
a
very
high
percentage
of
the
welfare
recipients
that
are
covered.
i
think
the
remoteness
requirement
indicates
very
definitely
that
congress
took
that
into
consideration.
mr.
dennis
r.
yeager
your
honor,
it
would
be
our
position
that
there
would
still
have
been
jurisdiction
in
the
court
at
that
time
under
the
cases
holding
that
1343
(3)
gives
the
court
--
1343
(4)
gives
the
federal
court’s
jurisdiction
to
review
federal
state
conformity
with
federal
statutes.
i
believe
though
that
--
mr.
dennis
r.
yeager
no
your
honor,
i
think
what
we
would
contend
--
well,
i
might
--
we
might
contend
that
but
i
think
the
first
thing
we
would
contend
would
be
the
section
1983
for
it
protects
federal
rights
for
citizens.
and
that
that
is
a
statute
which
would
bring
the
social
security
act
into
play
in
the
federal
court
and
in
turn,
you
would
have
jurisdiction
because
1983
is
a
statute
covered
by
1343
(4).
i
think
there
was
a
substantial
question
below
your
honor
for
two
reasons;
number
one,
we
won
on
one
of
those
questions,
the
due
process
question.
and
number
two,
on
a
very
similar
question,
the
fair
hearing
question,
the
second
circuit
recently
continued
a
preliminary
injunction
on
this
30-day
penalty
requirement
that
had
been
issued
by
a
district
court
judge.
mr.
dennis
r.
yeager
well,
your
honor,
that
1983
provides
a
remedy
for
the
deprivation
of
federal
rights.
mr.
dennis
r.
yeager
well,
your
honor,
1983
doesn’t
require
a
three-judge
court
but
a
statue,
this
--
as
i’m
saying
here,
the
--
oh,
i’m
sorry,
okay,
i
have
missed
that
point.
on
that
point,
you're
right,
i
didn’t
--
wouldn’t
be
a
three-judge
court,
i
thought
justice
--
mr.
dennis
r.
yeager
your
honor,
i’m
sorry,
i
thought
justice
rehnquist
was
asking
me
if
the
single
judge
would
still
have
jurisdiction
but
that
was
a
question
to
which
i
was
trying
to
address
myself.
as
to
that
question,
i
think
it’s
been
unresolved
at
this
point.
they
can
--
in
some
of
the
cases,
the
district
courts
have
been
continuing
to
set
as
three-judge
courts
to
deal
with
the
statutory
question
because
there
was
a
substantial
federal
constitutional
question.
certainly,
this
court
in
rosado
v.
wyman
held
that
the
single
judge
--
court
could
retain
jurisdiction
if
there
were
a
substantial
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
dennis
r.
yeager
if
the
three-judge
court
could
not.
mr.
dennis
r.
yeager
yes.
mr.
dennis
r.
yeager
are
there
further
questions?
thank
you
very
much.
