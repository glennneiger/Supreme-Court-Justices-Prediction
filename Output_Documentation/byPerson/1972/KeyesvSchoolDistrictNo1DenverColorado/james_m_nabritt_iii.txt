mr.
james
m.
nabritt
iii
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
keyes
case
is
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
review
a
judgment
of
the
tenth
circuit
which
in
part
affirmed
and
part
reversed
an
order
requiring
limited
desegregation
measures
in
the
public
schools
of
denver,
colorado.
petitioner's
submission
is
that
--
is
that
the
denver
system
has
violated
the
constitutional
rights
of
black
and
hispano
children
to
equal
protection
of
the
laws
and
that
the
courts
below
should
have
required
a
more
comprehensive
plan
to
desegregate
the
schools
and
otherwise
eliminate
discrimination.
although
the
case
comes
from
a
state
which
had
no
statutory
dual
system,
we
see
the
case
not
as
involving
so-called
“de
facto
segregation
issues,”
but
rather
as
one
with
segregation
practices
of
the
kind
the
court
has
been
dealing
with
in
the
cases
since
brown
against
the
board
of
education.
and
both
courts
below
agreed
with
us
but
the
denver
school's
board
engaged
in
deliberate
segregation
practices
in
shams
and
subterfuges
to
use
the
words
of
the
tenth
circuit
to
segregate.
but
the
courts
below
failed,
we
think,
to
accord
the
full
remedy
to
which
the
petitioners
are
entitled.
mr.
james
m.
nabritt
iii
that
--
that
is
--
mr.
james
m.
nabritt
iii
no,
that
is
correct.
my
task
in
the
argument
is
to
discuss
the
issues
in
part
1
of
our
brief,
dealing
with
racial
segregation,
the
issues
you
referred,
mr.
justice
stewart.
and
mr.
gordon
greiner
will
speak
next,
to
discuss
whether
the
operation
of
inferior
schools
for
black
and
hispano
children
also
violates
the
equal
protection
clause
that
requires
relief.
mr.
james
m.
nabritt
iii
we
think
that
either
ground,
segregation
or
inequality,
is
sufficient
to
justify
in
order
to
desegregate
the
schools
and
argue
also
that
both
grounds
together
justify
such
a
complete
remedy.
after
i
briefly
talk
about
the
facts
about
the
extensive
nature
of
pupil
and
faculty
segregation
of
the
denver
schools,
i
shall
argue
with
my
first
argument
that
if
we
draw
only
on
the
findings
and
conclusions
of
the
district
judge,
which
were
affirmed
on
appeal,
the
findings,
if
you
please,
of
de
--
of
de
jure
segregation,
the
term
the
courts
below
used,
that
denver
has
a
pattern,
practice
in
policy
of
racial
segregation
of
the
schools,
which
affected
a
large
and
significant
part
of
the
school
system,
not
just
a
few
schools,
not
just
an
isolated
or
de
minimis
discrimination
but
a
general
pattern.
i
will
argue
that
because
of
violations
found
below
were
system-wide,
the
remedy
should
have
been
aimed
at
all
of
the
segregated
schools.
mr.
james
m.
nabritt
iii
my
second
argument
will
be
that
the
facts
found
below
require
a
conclusion
that
illegal
segregation
was
considerably
more
widespread
in
the
--
in
the
system
than
the
courts
below
have.
and
that
portion
of
the
argument,
i
will
concentrate
on
the
manual
school
as
a
case
study
to
discuss
the
questions
about
the
burden
of
proof
of
prima
--
what
constitutes
a
prima
facie
discrimination
and
the
like,
and
also,
because
of
the
--
the
real
essential
importance
of
manual
high
school
as
the
key
stone
of
the
segregated
system,
sitting
atop
a
feeder
pattern
involving
all
the
core
elementary
schools,
11
elementary
schools
with
3800
black
pupils
in
1968,
feeding
into
the
segregated
high
school.
mr.
james
m.
nabritt
iii
the
school
board,
during
the
relevant
years,
had
one
black
member,
mrs.
noel.
she
was
the
member
who
initiated
the
--
the
three
--
mr.
james
m.
nabritt
iii
--
desegregation
resolutions
in
1968.
mr.
james
m.
nabritt
iii
the
school
board
was
composed
of
seven
elected
members.
mr.
james
m.
nabritt
iii
seven
elected
members.
mr.
james
m.
nabritt
iii
oh,
mrs.
noel
was
not
--
mr.
james
m.
nabritt
iii
yes.
mr.
james
m.
nabritt
iii
spring
of
1962.
when
--
when
the
case
the
--
the
board
members
run
city-wide,
they
don't
have
districts
there.
they
are
elected
largely
in
the
--
in
the
school
district.
now,
when
the
case
began,
the
separation
of
blacks
and
whites
in
the
system
really
was
very
intense.
although
only
14%
of
the
96,000
pupils
were
black,
the
vast
majority
were
concentrated
at
a
few
schools.
mr.
greiner
is
pointing
in
a
1968
elementary
schools
zone
map
in
which
we
have
shaded
in
dark
blue,
the
zones
of
10
elementary
schools
were
from
zero
to
9%
white
populations.
mr.
james
m.
nabritt
iii
fourteen
percent
negro,
20%
hispano
and
65%
anglo.
at
the
bottom
of
page
7
in
our
brief,
you
will
see
the
details
that
--
that
--
the
details,
statistics,
mr.
chief
justice.
now,
in
these
10
schools
shaded
in
blue,
we
find
two-thirds
of
the
black
elementary
pupils,
more
than
5500
of
them,
going
to
school
with
only
150
white
pupils,
less
than
one
half
of
1%.
another
15%
of
the
black
are
pupils
who
attend
the
other
seven
schools,
outlined
in
green
on
the
map,
which
are
from
10%
to
19%
anglo
and
most
of
those
of
schools
toward
the
west
are
majority
hispano,
all
of
these.
so,
the
forum
segregation
text
is
either
all
blacks
or
either
black
separated
from
whites
by
being
all
black
schools
or
black
separated
from
whites
by
being
in
schools
with
hispanos.
now
that
the
--
and
the
secondary
schools
had
--
had
the
outset
of
the
lawsuit,
a
similar
racial
concentration,
four-fifths
of
the
blacks
and
three
junior
high
schools
with
4%
of
the
anglos,
91%
of
the
blacks
at
--
at
two
high
schools
manual
in
east
and
the
other
200
black
high
school
pupils
spread
out
in
seven
schools
with
1300
whites.
as
the
faculty
concentration
and
segregation,
judge
doyle
found
that
this
was
part
of
--
of
the
pattern.
he
found
that
the
tendency
to
concentrate
minority
teachers
in
monitory
schools
helped
in
his
words,
helped
seal
off
these
schools
as
permanent
segregated
schools.
he
found
that
the
reason
for
the
concentration
of
blacks
and
hispanos
in
minority
schools
was,
and
i
quote
“because
of
concern
over
a
possible
lack
of
acceptance
by
the
white
community,
because
of
a
fear
of
lack
of
support
by
some
faculties
and
principals.”
so,
for
as
many
10
years
after
brown,
all
of
the
black
and
hispano
teachers
in
the
system
were
assigned
only
to
the
schools
where
black
pupils
were
concentrated.
and
the
figures
on
the
faculty
concentration
patterns
are
set
out
in
detail
at
pages
12
and
13
of
our
brief.
note
particularly,
the
--
the
overall
small
proportion
of
black
and
hispano
teachers,
the
black
teachers
were
only
7%
and
hispanos
only
2%
in
1968
and
of
course,
in
the
early
years,
there
were
many
--
fewer
such
teachers.
so,
when
--
when
you
see
a
school
with
50%
black
faculty
and
assist
them
with
only
7%
black
teachers,
you
can
see
what's
going
on.
and
i
might
say
at
this
point
that
it
seems
to
me
that
the
tenth
circuit's
reversal
of
judge
doyle's
faculty
desegregation
injunction
most
clearly
departs
from
this
court's
holdings,
in
swann
and
the
other
cases.
the
--
the
tenth
circuit
held
that
this
admitted
pattern
of
racial
faculty
assignments
was
justifiable
because
when
they
began
back
in
the
superintendent
--
former
superintendent
(inaudible)
has
said
it
that
they
wanted
role
models
for
black
pupils
in
the
black
schools.
that
of
course
have
nothing
to
do
with
it,
but
they
excluded
with
judge
doyle's
finding
that
they
were
excluding
black
faculty
from
the
white
schools.
now,
to
begin
my
first
argument,
as
i've
said
for
the
purposes
of
the
first
argument,
we
accept
as
correct
the
rulings
of
both
courts
below
on
the
facts
and
the
law
about
school
segregation
in
denver.
the
courts
below
found
segregation
illegal
only
when
the
plaintiffs
were
able
to
prove
that
the
school
board's
explanation
and
justifications
for
segregatory
acts,
where
i
quote
“a
sham
and
a
subterfuge
consuming
odious
intent.”
this
was
the
highest
standard,
the
difficult
burden
that
the
--
that
the
tenth
circuit
said
--
the
plaintiff
said
to
me.
and
even
with
this
excessively
strict
burden,
plaintiffs
were
able
to
satisfy
both
courts
below
that
the
denver
system
deliberately
segregated
eight
schools
attended
by
37%
of
all
the
black
pupils
in
the
school
system.
our
brief
at
pages
17
and
18
breaks
down
those
figures
in
detail.
it
identifies
the
schools
and
the
percentages.
now,
the
eight
schools
found
deliberately
segregated
below
in
row
a
fourth
of
the
black
elementary
children,
68%
of
the
black
junior
high
school
children
and
45%
of
the
black
senior
high
school
children.
and
our
argument
is
that
properly
analyzed,
the
holdings
below
showed
that
denver
did
have
a
pattern
of
practice
of
systematic
discrimination
but
justified
relief
of
all
the
segregated
school.
now,
judge
doyle
found
in
general
that
the
denver
school
board
had
a
10-year
segregation
policy,
and
he
said
the
several
different
places
in
his
opinion
in
several
different
ways.
but
this
is
not
just
a
question
of
numbers
or
the
percentage
of
--
of
black
pupils
in
the
system
affected
by
this
file.
it
is
not
just
a
question
of
how
many
schools
that's
involved.
it's
a
question
of
policy
and
that
the
findings
of
deliberate
implication
include
policy
decisions
about
all
kinds
of
questions.
they
were
such
things
as
the
location
in
those
schools,
the
place
besides
of
schools,
location
conditions,
the
fixing
of
attendants
boundary
lines,
years
of
optional
zones,
years
of
mobile
classrooms,
the
faculty
segregation
policy,
which
was
obviously
had
systemwide
applications,
and
the
recession
of
the
three
integration
resolutions
in
the
spring
of
1969.
the
only
--
now,
let
me
give
two
examples
of
how
judge
doyle's
findings
about
northeast
denver
really
implicate
more
than
just
the
schools
in
the
northeast
of
town.
mr.
james
m.
nabritt
iii
more
than
just
the
local
schools
involved
in
the
northeast
part
of
town.
one
of
the
findings
by
judge
doyle
was
that
the
board
placed
28
mobile
classrooms,
up
in
the
northeast
part
of
denver
as
mr.
greiner's
pointing
at.
and
that
--
and
judge
doyle
found
in
the
quotation
set
out
in
our
brief
on
page
25,
that
these
mobile
--
the
placement
of
these
mobile
classrooms
was
used
to
keep
blacks
confined
in
the
black
schools
and
out
of
the
white
schools.
mr.
james
m.
nabritt
iii
the
manual
high
school
is
in
the
center
there
in
a
so-called
5.0
you
referred
to
an
opinion
is
just
the
size
of
manual.
mr.
james
m.
nabritt
iii
the
barret
schools,
stedman
school,
hallet
school,
the
schools
that
the
--
so
frequently
mentioned
in
the
opinion
of
these
three
that
it
was
held
that
the
policy
was
to
segregate
to
prevent
park
hill
and
philips,
to
keep
those
schools
majority
white,
while
these
schools
turn
black.
mr.
james
m.
nabritt
iii
the
--
under
10%
anglo
and
10%
to
20%
--
mr.
james
m.
nabritt
iii
white.
now
all
these
schools
are
--
now,
at
the
same
time
these
mobile
units
were
placed
in
--
in
these
park
hill
area
schools,
the
northeast
denver
schools.
in
the
southwest
part
of
the
city,
a
new
--
a
new
neighborhood
was
annexed
into
the
school
system
which
had
700
--
which
later
became
a
trailer
area,
which
had
700
children
in
those
schools
down
there.
and
so,
instead
of
building
mobile
units
at
the
--
at
the
two
nearby
schools,
(inaudible)
the
board
instituted
a
policy
of
busing
these
anglo
children
10
miles
across
to
the
southwest
part
of
the
city,
the
university
park,
asburian
court.
and
another
example
is
the
montbello
area,
a
newly
developed
area
out
there
on
the
airport
in
the
north
--
west
part,
and
that
area
had
no
junior
high
school.
those
--
those
pupils
were
bussed
past
the
--
the
black
schools
smiley
and
cory
all
the
way
to
the
east
part
of
town
over
at
lake
junior
high
school.
mr.
james
m.
nabritt
iii
west
to
lake
junior
high
school.
now
there
--
the
--
and
i
didn't
--
i
didn't
really
finish
the
trailer
example.
when
--
when
trailer
school
was
opened
and
freeing
700
spaces
in
the
southeast
area,
even
though
the
board
said
it
had
a
policy
of
using
transportation
to
promote
immigration,
it
didn't
use
those
spaces
to
relieve
the
overcrowding.
they
removed
the
mobile
units.
that's
what
part
of
the
recession
controversy
was
about,
simply
removing
mobile
units
to
reassign
--
to
reassigning
children
in
overcrowded
black
schools
to
another
neighborhood.
mr.
james
m.
nabritt
iii
the
--
mr.
james
m.
nabritt
iii
the
finding
was
that
there
were
28
mobile
units
in
--
all
in
northeast
denver
at
an
average
of
30
pupils
a
classroom,
i
suppose
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
james
m.
nabritt
iii
yes,
yes,
the
neighborhood
of
800
or
perhaps
more.
now,
we
think
that
proving
a
policy
and
pattern
of
illegal
segregation
and
it's
obviously
not
practical
in
a
--
in
a
brief
oral
argument
to
really
get
into
all
the
evidence
of
a
trial
that
took
more
than
20
days,
but
the
--
but
that
the
findings
do
properly
show
such
policy.
in
other
race
discrimination
fields,
most
notably
in
cases
involving
exclusion
of
blacks
from
jury
service,
the
courts
regard
a
prima
facie
case
is
proved
and
there
showed
to
be
a
general
pattern
exclusion
that
has
been
an
opportunity
to
discriminate.
the
alexander
against
louisiana
on
last
term
exemplifies
that
type
of
approach
and
we
think
something
that
identical
but
some
sort
of
similar
approach.
the
development
of
a
prima
facie
case
is
obviously
necessary
in
this
field,
but
the
fifth
circuit's
recent
decisions,
en
banc
decisions
in
the
austin,
texas
and
the
corpus
christi
case
reject
this
idea
which
is
advanced
by
the
briefs,
briefs
of
the
united
states,
and
the
briefs
of
school
board
in
this
case
that
it's
necessary
to
prove
segregation
by
approving
the
discriminatory
act
in
every
single
school
in
the
system.
the
fifth
circuit
points
out
that
such
a
rule
has
never
been
argued
by
the
government
before
in
the
whole
history
of
school
cases.
it
wasn't
long
ago
that
united
states
was
pioneering
state-wide
school
desegregation
case
against
alabama
and
georgia
and
--
and
this
new
notion
that
you
have
to
prove
school
by
school
was
a
plain
reversal
where
judge
wisdom
said
was
the
tried
and
true
method
of
proving
school
segregation,
namely
the
act.
now,
the
proponents
of
the
school
by
school
approach
must
know
that
they're
demandingly
impossible,
that
such
a
rule
would
virtually
immunize
most
school
segregation
for
the
challenge.
i
mean
school
boards
don't
keep
records
and
--
and
very
long
on
this
issues,
and
in
this
case
they
weren't
any
even
maps
of
attendance
those
in
denver
prior
to
1960
and
it
had
to
be
reconstructed
by
very
laborious
and
painstaking
process.
and
the
basic
figures,
statistics
about
racial
counting
in
schools.
last
thing,
that's
a
sort
of
thing
that
weren't
available
for
many
relevant
years.
now,
my
second
argument
is
that
the
pattern
of
segregation
was
even
wider
than
the
courts
below
actually
held
because
of
some
of
the
legal
rulings.
we
think
that
the
evidence
shows
that
manual
high
school,
manual
training
high
school
is
in
the
classic
pattern.
i
was
about
to
use
the
word
of
swann,
it
was
school
that
was
established
for
one
race
set
up
for
minority
group
pupils
and
planned
as
such.
now,
on
that
collective
brief
of
the
solicitor
general
supports
that
contention
that
new
manual
was
established
as
a
minority
school
with
explicit
racial
segregations.
the
little
book
which
is
excerpted
in
the
record
published
by
the
school
board
when
manual
was
being
planned,
explained
in
exhibit
356
makes
it
obvious
that
manual
really
was
planned
for
black
and
hispano
students
as
thus
the
testimony
by
the
--
by
the
then
superintendent,
mr.
(inaudible)
the
book
had
said
that
in
essence
that
manual
was
going
to
be
different.
this
is
back
in
--
in
the
early
1950s
before
brown
was
planned,
manual
is
going
to
be
different.
the
people
were
building
the
school
for
replacing
the
older
building,
special
problems
residing
there.
they
had
a
long
--
in
the
book
they
had
a
long
history
of
the
racial
composition
of
the
school
and
have
gradually
changed
from
white
to
a
majority
of
black
and
hispano.
so,
because
of
the
manual's
different
population,
they
were
planning
a
different
curriculum.
now,
judge
doyle
condemned
the
similar
planning
of
a
school
in
barrett
after
brown
but
for
some
reason,
he
focused
on
the
fact
that
manual
was
planned
before
brown
as
a
minority
school
and
we
think
that's
the
wrong
point
that
even
though
what
the
school
board
was
doing
didn't
violate
the
law
of
the
land
back
before
brown,
they
nevertheless
were
engaging
in
explicitly
racial
considerations.
and
brown
applies
just
as
much
here
as
it
does
in
states
which
had
segregation
laws.
there
really
isn't
time
to
go
into
the
evidence
about
manual
about
the
subsequent
boundary
changes,
but
sufficient
to
say
judge
doyle
never
found
that
these
boundary
changes
were
rational
justified
in
annual
basis
–
let's
get
about
some
other
boundary
changes.
but
only
that
he
applied
some
sort
of
a
notion
about
the
burden
of
proof
which
we
say
and
argue
in
more
detail
in
our
brief
this
cast
the
burden
of
proof.
a
point
not
made
very
clearly
in
the
briefs
is
the
integral
relationship
that
manual
atop
the
feeder
pattern
of
11
elementary
schools
in
the
court
area
plus
co-junior
high
school
which
feed
pupils
into
manual.
segregating
manual,
establishing
it
as
a
black
school
atop
all
these
schools
feeding
into
it
obviously
is
going
to
have
an
influence
on
those
other
schools.
i
mean,
a
white
person
living
in
one
of
these
feeder
schools
who
wanted
to
avoid
for
each
child
the
school
which
the
board
had
set
up
there's
the
minority.
high
school
is
obviously
induced
to
move
out
of
the
feeder
school
areas.
so,
those
are
--
if
you're
interested
in
what
the
percentages
are,
if
you
add
manually,
its
feeder
pattern
for
the
northeast
denver
schools,
then
you
really
do
have
74%
of
the
black
in
school
system
involved
in
illegal
segregation.
mr.
james
m.
nabritt
iii
well,
the
feeder
schools
for
manual
are
mitchell,
gilpin,
swansea,
harrington,
columbine,
ebert,
whittier,
crofton,
elyria,
garden
place,
and
wyatt.
i
would
like
to
conclude
by
reemphasizing
the
passage
of
swann
which
points
out
that
school
authority's
decisions
about
construction,
location,
size
of
school,
and
then
what
kind
of
policies
and
triple
assignment
there
will
be
will
determine
the
racial
composition
of
the
student
by
in
each
school
and
assistant.
it's
the
school
board's
decisions
that
determine
the
racial
composition.
they
define
the
neighborhoods
for
--
the
neighborhood
school
policy.
they
constantly
redefine
what
the
neighborhoods
are
so
that
at
the
very
least,
our
submission
is
where
a
school
district
is
found
to
be
engaged
in
using
chance
and
centrifuges.
the
burden
shifts
to
the
board
to
show
that
schools
which
look
at
every
respect
like
the
schools
they
found
to
have
been
illegally
segregated
except
that
they
have
some
rational
explanation
are
justified
by
some
compelling
interest
of
the
state
and
that
the
state's
interest
could
not
have
been
served
by
less
segregatory
results.
denver
had
integration
alternatives
in
every
step
and
always
rejected
them
and
chose
segregation.
mr.
james
m.
nabritt
iii
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice.
may
it
please
the
court.
we
see
the
whole
case
as
a
de
jure
case.
i
think
that
the
relationship
between
our
two
arguments
is
very
well
illustrated
by
this
court's
decision
in
1965
in
the
case
called
rogers
against
paul.
that
was
the
case
to
desegregating
in
arkansas
school
system,
where
the
desegregation
was
proceeding
at
a
greater
year
of
level
under
the
deliberate
speed
doctrine.
and
yet,
when
black
pupils
in
the
high
school
grades
were
able
to
demonstrate
in
this
court
that
they
were
unable
to
get
classes
and
curriculum
in
the
black
school
that
was
offered
in
the
white
school,
this
court
carved
down
an
exception
to
the
deliberate
speed
doctrine
and
said,
“under
brown
or
under
swett,
paid
her
under
a
combination
or
merger
of
the
two
theories,
this
was
a
violation
of
equal
protection
with
few
remedy
by
integration.”
now,
the
remedy
in
the
swett
case
was
integration,
the
remedy
in
the
(inaudible)
case
was
integration
and
it
wasn't
just
based
on
some
sort
of
theory
of
achievement
that
human
sweat
might
graduate
from
law
school
and
not
be
a
lawyer.
the
inequality
was
in
the
--
the
opportunity
he
had
and
the
barriers
are
put
in
front.
so,
we
represent
the
constitutional
rights
and
claimers,
the
deprivation
for
the
students
that
fetches
at
the
top
of
the
class
at
manual
as
well
as
the
student
that
does
speak
well.
now,
we
think
that
for
any
quasi
justice
is
just
for
segregation.
there
should
be
no
single
doctrine
or
remedy
for
inequality
and
we
don't
urge
that
sort
of
a
proposition.
what
we
urge
is
that
judge
doyle
was
at
least
with
him
at
the
discretion
and
listening
to
this
evidence
and
listening
to
the
particulars
of
how
the
school
board
said
they
would
going
to
remedy
the
inequality,
they
concluded
--
well,
it
doesn't
--
it
won't
hold
order
or
maybe
(inaudible)
the
way
that
seems
most
official,
most
sure
to
accomplish
equality
is
to
put
the
pupils
in
school
together,
and
it
was
that
sort
of
overall
judgment,
we
think
judge
doyle
may.
about
the
question
from
the
court
about
the
age
of
the
buildings,
what
judge
doyle
said
at
page
61
in
313
federal
supplement
is,
“however,
we
do
not
think
that
the
age
of
a
building
and
cite
sizes
are
in
and
off
themselves
substantial
facts
as
affecting
the
educational
opportunity
offered
at
a
given
school.
however,
we
do
recognize
that
in
schools
which
are
segregated,
have
less
experienced
teachers,
produce
generally
low
achieving
students.
the
fact
that
the
physical
plan
is
old
may
aggravate
the
aura
of
inferiority
which
surrounds
the
school.”
and
we
are
talking
about
the
19th
century
schools.
we're
talking
about
schools
that
are
built
in
the
last
century
which
in
--
in
the
old
part
of
the
city.
mr.
justice
powell
asked
the
question
about
the
busing
statistics.
they
are
set
out
at
page
26
of
our
brief.
in
addition,
there
are
two
maps
in
the
original
record
not
pretty
less
but
large
amounts
which
show
the
bus
routes.
they
are
plaintiffs'
exhibits
390a
and
390b,
which
they
show
the
people's
crisscrossing
the
city.
there
is
one
exhibit
about
manual
which
is
printed.
that's
the
school
of
booklet
that
the
school
board
are
published
before
they
set
up
the
school.
it
shows
what
they
were
doing.
it
shows
the
establishment
of
a
dual
school.
and
these
are
only
excerpts
from
the
booklet
printed
here
but
the
whole
is
in
the
record
filed
with
the
clerk.
on
this
question
of
the
decision,
judge
--
with
the
no
fancy
constitutional
theory,
it
is
necessary
to
support
judge
doyle's
conclusion
that
what
this
showed
in
the
factual
context
of
the
case
in
the
series
of
things
that
got
going
on
with
relation
to
these
schools
was
what
judge
doyle
said
with
both
of
purpose
and
effect
to
keep
black
get
segregated
as
they
are
not
his
family.
so,
--
mr.
james
m.
nabritt
iii
mr.
justice
powell,
i
would
give
my
answer
by
saying
that
--
i'm
dividing
the
two
parts.
i'll
say,
first
on
the
state
action
question
that
we
agreed
entirely
with
the
process
of
solicitor
general.
it's
the
state
running
the
schools
that
they
determined
the
racial
composition
of
the
schools,
so
the
real
question
is
whether
or
not
there's
been
discrimination
which
violates
the
constitution
on
this
record.
and
i
would
say
that
it
is
not
--
i
would
say
first
that
it
is
not
necessary
on
the
record
to
reach
that
issue
of
whether
or
not
--
whether
or
not
segregation
is
illegal
if
there
was
no
racial
discrimination.
but
on
that
question,
i
would
think
that
certainly,
discrimination
is
inferable
from
the
facts,
the
facts
that
both
courts
below
agreed
to.
that
--
that
there
is
segregation
pattern,
that
the
school
board
did
have
all
these
opportunity
and
control,
that
there
was
widespread
--
spread
bias
in
the
system
and
that
--
and
because
of
the
known
inequality
of
the
schools.
now,
there
is
one
--
one
absence
in
--
in
this
record
and
that
is
the
absence
of
any
--
of
any
evidence
about
the
important
factor
which
is
what
caused
the
--
the
housing
segregation,
whether
that
--
government
was
responsible
for
that.
there
are
other
cases
they
litigated
where
they
are
including
some
pending
on
certiorari
where
that
--
that
question
has
been
--
that
has
been
addressed
in
evidence
and
--
and
that
fact
findings
by
the
courts
on
it.
we
--
we
don't
think
it's
necessary
to
--
to
reach
that
--
mr.
james
m.
nabritt
iii
that
--
that
wasn't
litigated
here
because
we've
placed
it
at
the
jury
--
mr.
james
m.
nabritt
iii
but
that
was
their
--
that
was
their
holding
that
they
find
themselves.
mr.
james
m.
nabritt
iii
well
--
if
this
--
faced
with
that
decision,
and
i
--
i
would
still
argue
that
we
should
win
the
case.
and
based
on
that
--
mr.
james
m.
nabritt
iii
well,
i
mean
i
would
--
i'd
be
willing
to
follow
it
up
to
--
to
its
logical
conclusion
if
i
had
to,
but
that
the
inequality
argument
justifies
relief
without
regard
to
--
to
--
and
--and
indeed
that
the
school
board
so
can
--
really
does
control
the
racial
composition
of
a
school.
mr.
james
m.
nabritt
iii
well,
i
--
i
don't
--
i
don't
envision
any
real
--
realistic
record
as
involving
only
inaction
but
determining
hard
and
that
--
that
certainly
might
be
part
of
it.
mr.
james
m.
nabritt
iii
let
us
say
they
make
--
they
make
decisions.
mr.
james
m.
nabritt
iii
i
--
i
think
that
as
a
--as
a
matter
of
--
of
making
a
prima
facie
case
of
--
of
violation
of
the
constitution,
that
plaintiffs
can
do
it
by
showing
whether
it
is
a
substantive
rule
or
not,
i
don't
know.
certainly,
in
terms
of
--
of
making
out
a
prima
facie
case,
a
discrimination,
plaintiffs
can
do
it
without
showing
what
the
court
of
appeals
called
odious
intent.
maybe
the
--
the
--
if
--
if
the
court,
i
don't
know
any
other
answer,
mr.
justice
stewart.
i'm
not
trying
to
evade
the
question.
it's
certainly
open
to
the
court
to
reach
the
de
facto
issue
here
if
it
--
if
it
so
chose,
i
--
i
would
think.
what
we
are
urging
is
that
it's
not
necessary
and
--
and
if
the
court
found
it
necessary
to
reach
that
issue,
then
we
would
urge
that
--
that
in
any
of
that,
we
should
win
the
case
that
--
that
whatever
discriminatory
intent
or
--
or
if
discriminatory
intent
or
at
least
intent
is
necessary
that
it's
inferable
for
a
prima
facie
case
which
requires
that
the
--
that
it
be
rebutted.
mr.
james
m.
nabritt
iii
i
--
i
would
argue
the
proposition
alternatively
as
a
question
of
approving
a
prima
facie
case,
i
know
is
a
substantive
question
of
substitute
law.
i
--
i
think
that
the
school
board
is
really
--
are
controlling
the
race
and
composition
of
the
schools,
and
that
--
and
that
segregation
and
deliberate
segregation
is
widespread.
so
that
when
you
show
an
element
such
as
what
we
have
here,
a
situation
to
use
judge
doyle's
phrase
that
looks
just
as
if
they
deliberately
segregate
and
--and
if
judge
doyle
said,
“the
results
are
just
the
same,”
as
if
they
had
a
segregation
policy,
but
what
i
find
here
is
that
they
had
a)
an
explanation,
a
rational
justification
for
this.
i
say
that's
not
enough,
that
they
have
to
have
a
compelling
justification
for
producing
this
kind
of
segregatory
result
whether
they
--
with
or
without
an
attempt.
i
hope
that's
the
complete
answer.
i
know
i've
gone
over
my
time
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
james
m.
nabritt
iii
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
keyes
case
is
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
review
a
judgment
of
the
tenth
circuit
which
in
part
affirmed
and
part
reversed
an
order
requiring
limited
desegregation
measures
in
the
public
schools
of
denver,
colorado.
petitioner's
submission
is
that
--
is
that
the
denver
system
has
violated
the
constitutional
rights
of
black
and
hispano
children
to
equal
protection
of
the
laws
and
that
the
courts
below
should
have
required
a
more
comprehensive
plan
to
desegregate
the
schools
and
otherwise
eliminate
discrimination.
although
the
case
comes
from
a
state
which
had
no
statutory
dual
system,
we
see
the
case
not
as
involving
so-called
“de
facto
segregation
issues,”
but
rather
as
one
with
segregation
practices
of
the
kind
the
court
has
been
dealing
with
in
the
cases
since
brown
against
the
board
of
education.
and
both
courts
below
agreed
with
us
but
the
denver
school's
board
engaged
in
deliberate
segregation
practices
in
shams
and
subterfuges
to
use
the
words
of
the
tenth
circuit
to
segregate.
but
the
courts
below
failed,
we
think,
to
accord
the
full
remedy
to
which
the
petitioners
are
entitled.
mr.
james
m.
nabritt
iii
that
--
that
is
--
mr.
james
m.
nabritt
iii
no,
that
is
correct.
my
task
in
the
argument
is
to
discuss
the
issues
in
part
1
of
our
brief,
dealing
with
racial
segregation,
the
issues
you
referred,
mr.
justice
stewart.
and
mr.
gordon
greiner
will
speak
next,
to
discuss
whether
the
operation
of
inferior
schools
for
black
and
hispano
children
also
violates
the
equal
protection
clause
that
requires
relief.
mr.
james
m.
nabritt
iii
we
think
that
either
ground,
segregation
or
inequality,
is
sufficient
to
justify
in
order
to
desegregate
the
schools
and
argue
also
that
both
grounds
together
justify
such
a
complete
remedy.
after
i
briefly
talk
about
the
facts
about
the
extensive
nature
of
pupil
and
faculty
segregation
of
the
denver
schools,
i
shall
argue
with
my
first
argument
that
if
we
draw
only
on
the
findings
and
conclusions
of
the
district
judge,
which
were
affirmed
on
appeal,
the
findings,
if
you
please,
of
de
--
of
de
jure
segregation,
the
term
the
courts
below
used,
that
denver
has
a
pattern,
practice
in
policy
of
racial
segregation
of
the
schools,
which
affected
a
large
and
significant
part
of
the
school
system,
not
just
a
few
schools,
not
just
an
isolated
or
de
minimis
discrimination
but
a
general
pattern.
i
will
argue
that
because
of
violations
found
below
were
system-wide,
the
remedy
should
have
been
aimed
at
all
of
the
segregated
schools.
mr.
james
m.
nabritt
iii
my
second
argument
will
be
that
the
facts
found
below
require
a
conclusion
that
illegal
segregation
was
considerably
more
widespread
in
the
--
in
the
system
than
the
courts
below
have.
and
that
portion
of
the
argument,
i
will
concentrate
on
the
manual
school
as
a
case
study
to
discuss
the
questions
about
the
burden
of
proof
of
prima
--
what
constitutes
a
prima
facie
discrimination
and
the
like,
and
also,
because
of
the
--
the
real
essential
importance
of
manual
high
school
as
the
key
stone
of
the
segregated
system,
sitting
atop
a
feeder
pattern
involving
all
the
core
elementary
schools,
11
elementary
schools
with
3800
black
pupils
in
1968,
feeding
into
the
segregated
high
school.
mr.
james
m.
nabritt
iii
the
school
board,
during
the
relevant
years,
had
one
black
member,
mrs.
noel.
she
was
the
member
who
initiated
the
--
the
three
--
mr.
james
m.
nabritt
iii
--
desegregation
resolutions
in
1968.
mr.
james
m.
nabritt
iii
the
school
board
was
composed
of
seven
elected
members.
mr.
james
m.
nabritt
iii
seven
elected
members.
mr.
james
m.
nabritt
iii
oh,
mrs.
noel
was
not
--
mr.
james
m.
nabritt
iii
yes.
mr.
james
m.
nabritt
iii
spring
of
1962.
when
--
when
the
case
the
--
the
board
members
run
city-wide,
they
don't
have
districts
there.
they
are
elected
largely
in
the
--
in
the
school
district.
now,
when
the
case
began,
the
separation
of
blacks
and
whites
in
the
system
really
was
very
intense.
although
only
14%
of
the
96,000
pupils
were
black,
the
vast
majority
were
concentrated
at
a
few
schools.
mr.
greiner
is
pointing
in
a
1968
elementary
schools
zone
map
in
which
we
have
shaded
in
dark
blue,
the
zones
of
10
elementary
schools
were
from
zero
to
9%
white
populations.
mr.
james
m.
nabritt
iii
fourteen
percent
negro,
20%
hispano
and
65%
anglo.
at
the
bottom
of
page
7
in
our
brief,
you
will
see
the
details
that
--
that
--
the
details,
statistics,
mr.
chief
justice.
now,
in
these
10
schools
shaded
in
blue,
we
find
two-thirds
of
the
black
elementary
pupils,
more
than
5500
of
them,
going
to
school
with
only
150
white
pupils,
less
than
one
half
of
1%.
another
15%
of
the
black
are
pupils
who
attend
the
other
seven
schools,
outlined
in
green
on
the
map,
which
are
from
10%
to
19%
anglo
and
most
of
those
of
schools
toward
the
west
are
majority
hispano,
all
of
these.
so,
the
forum
segregation
text
is
either
all
blacks
or
either
black
separated
from
whites
by
being
all
black
schools
or
black
separated
from
whites
by
being
in
schools
with
hispanos.
now
that
the
--
and
the
secondary
schools
had
--
had
the
outset
of
the
lawsuit,
a
similar
racial
concentration,
four-fifths
of
the
blacks
and
three
junior
high
schools
with
4%
of
the
anglos,
91%
of
the
blacks
at
--
at
two
high
schools
manual
in
east
and
the
other
200
black
high
school
pupils
spread
out
in
seven
schools
with
1300
whites.
as
the
faculty
concentration
and
segregation,
judge
doyle
found
that
this
was
part
of
--
of
the
pattern.
he
found
that
the
tendency
to
concentrate
minority
teachers
in
monitory
schools
helped
in
his
words,
helped
seal
off
these
schools
as
permanent
segregated
schools.
he
found
that
the
reason
for
the
concentration
of
blacks
and
hispanos
in
minority
schools
was,
and
i
quote
“because
of
concern
over
a
possible
lack
of
acceptance
by
the
white
community,
because
of
a
fear
of
lack
of
support
by
some
faculties
and
principals.”
so,
for
as
many
10
years
after
brown,
all
of
the
black
and
hispano
teachers
in
the
system
were
assigned
only
to
the
schools
where
black
pupils
were
concentrated.
and
the
figures
on
the
faculty
concentration
patterns
are
set
out
in
detail
at
pages
12
and
13
of
our
brief.
note
particularly,
the
--
the
overall
small
proportion
of
black
and
hispano
teachers,
the
black
teachers
were
only
7%
and
hispanos
only
2%
in
1968
and
of
course,
in
the
early
years,
there
were
many
--
fewer
such
teachers.
so,
when
--
when
you
see
a
school
with
50%
black
faculty
and
assist
them
with
only
7%
black
teachers,
you
can
see
what's
going
on.
and
i
might
say
at
this
point
that
it
seems
to
me
that
the
tenth
circuit's
reversal
of
judge
doyle's
faculty
desegregation
injunction
most
clearly
departs
from
this
court's
holdings,
in
swann
and
the
other
cases.
the
--
the
tenth
circuit
held
that
this
admitted
pattern
of
racial
faculty
assignments
was
justifiable
because
when
they
began
back
in
the
superintendent
--
former
superintendent
(inaudible)
has
said
it
that
they
wanted
role
models
for
black
pupils
in
the
black
schools.
that
of
course
have
nothing
to
do
with
it,
but
they
excluded
with
judge
doyle's
finding
that
they
were
excluding
black
faculty
from
the
white
schools.
now,
to
begin
my
first
argument,
as
i've
said
for
the
purposes
of
the
first
argument,
we
accept
as
correct
the
rulings
of
both
courts
below
on
the
facts
and
the
law
about
school
segregation
in
denver.
the
courts
below
found
segregation
illegal
only
when
the
plaintiffs
were
able
to
prove
that
the
school
board's
explanation
and
justifications
for
segregatory
acts,
where
i
quote
“a
sham
and
a
subterfuge
consuming
odious
intent.”
this
was
the
highest
standard,
the
difficult
burden
that
the
--
that
the
tenth
circuit
said
--
the
plaintiff
said
to
me.
and
even
with
this
excessively
strict
burden,
plaintiffs
were
able
to
satisfy
both
courts
below
that
the
denver
system
deliberately
segregated
eight
schools
attended
by
37%
of
all
the
black
pupils
in
the
school
system.
our
brief
at
pages
17
and
18
breaks
down
those
figures
in
detail.
it
identifies
the
schools
and
the
percentages.
now,
the
eight
schools
found
deliberately
segregated
below
in
row
a
fourth
of
the
black
elementary
children,
68%
of
the
black
junior
high
school
children
and
45%
of
the
black
senior
high
school
children.
and
our
argument
is
that
properly
analyzed,
the
holdings
below
showed
that
denver
did
have
a
pattern
of
practice
of
systematic
discrimination
but
justified
relief
of
all
the
segregated
school.
now,
judge
doyle
found
in
general
that
the
denver
school
board
had
a
10-year
segregation
policy,
and
he
said
the
several
different
places
in
his
opinion
in
several
different
ways.
but
this
is
not
just
a
question
of
numbers
or
the
percentage
of
--
of
black
pupils
in
the
system
affected
by
this
file.
it
is
not
just
a
question
of
how
many
schools
that's
involved.
it's
a
question
of
policy
and
that
the
findings
of
deliberate
implication
include
policy
decisions
about
all
kinds
of
questions.
they
were
such
things
as
the
location
in
those
schools,
the
place
besides
of
schools,
location
conditions,
the
fixing
of
attendants
boundary
lines,
years
of
optional
zones,
years
of
mobile
classrooms,
the
faculty
segregation
policy,
which
was
obviously
had
systemwide
applications,
and
the
recession
of
the
three
integration
resolutions
in
the
spring
of
1969.
the
only
--
now,
let
me
give
two
examples
of
how
judge
doyle's
findings
about
northeast
denver
really
implicate
more
than
just
the
schools
in
the
northeast
of
town.
mr.
james
m.
nabritt
iii
more
than
just
the
local
schools
involved
in
the
northeast
part
of
town.
one
of
the
findings
by
judge
doyle
was
that
the
board
placed
28
mobile
classrooms,
up
in
the
northeast
part
of
denver
as
mr.
greiner's
pointing
at.
and
that
--
and
judge
doyle
found
in
the
quotation
set
out
in
our
brief
on
page
25,
that
these
mobile
--
the
placement
of
these
mobile
classrooms
was
used
to
keep
blacks
confined
in
the
black
schools
and
out
of
the
white
schools.
mr.
james
m.
nabritt
iii
the
manual
high
school
is
in
the
center
there
in
a
so-called
5.0
you
referred
to
an
opinion
is
just
the
size
of
manual.
mr.
james
m.
nabritt
iii
the
barret
schools,
stedman
school,
hallet
school,
the
schools
that
the
--
so
frequently
mentioned
in
the
opinion
of
these
three
that
it
was
held
that
the
policy
was
to
segregate
to
prevent
park
hill
and
philips,
to
keep
those
schools
majority
white,
while
these
schools
turn
black.
mr.
james
m.
nabritt
iii
the
--
under
10%
anglo
and
10%
to
20%
--
mr.
james
m.
nabritt
iii
white.
now
all
these
schools
are
--
now,
at
the
same
time
these
mobile
units
were
placed
in
--
in
these
park
hill
area
schools,
the
northeast
denver
schools.
in
the
southwest
part
of
the
city,
a
new
--
a
new
neighborhood
was
annexed
into
the
school
system
which
had
700
--
which
later
became
a
trailer
area,
which
had
700
children
in
those
schools
down
there.
and
so,
instead
of
building
mobile
units
at
the
--
at
the
two
nearby
schools,
(inaudible)
the
board
instituted
a
policy
of
busing
these
anglo
children
10
miles
across
to
the
southwest
part
of
the
city,
the
university
park,
asburian
court.
and
another
example
is
the
montbello
area,
a
newly
developed
area
out
there
on
the
airport
in
the
north
--
west
part,
and
that
area
had
no
junior
high
school.
those
--
those
pupils
were
bussed
past
the
--
the
black
schools
smiley
and
cory
all
the
way
to
the
east
part
of
town
over
at
lake
junior
high
school.
mr.
james
m.
nabritt
iii
west
to
lake
junior
high
school.
now
there
--
the
--
and
i
didn't
--
i
didn't
really
finish
the
trailer
example.
when
--
when
trailer
school
was
opened
and
freeing
700
spaces
in
the
southeast
area,
even
though
the
board
said
it
had
a
policy
of
using
transportation
to
promote
immigration,
it
didn't
use
those
spaces
to
relieve
the
overcrowding.
they
removed
the
mobile
units.
that's
what
part
of
the
recession
controversy
was
about,
simply
removing
mobile
units
to
reassign
--
to
reassigning
children
in
overcrowded
black
schools
to
another
neighborhood.
mr.
james
m.
nabritt
iii
the
--
mr.
james
m.
nabritt
iii
the
finding
was
that
there
were
28
mobile
units
in
--
all
in
northeast
denver
at
an
average
of
30
pupils
a
classroom,
i
suppose
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
james
m.
nabritt
iii
yes,
yes,
the
neighborhood
of
800
or
perhaps
more.
now,
we
think
that
proving
a
policy
and
pattern
of
illegal
segregation
and
it's
obviously
not
practical
in
a
--
in
a
brief
oral
argument
to
really
get
into
all
the
evidence
of
a
trial
that
took
more
than
20
days,
but
the
--
but
that
the
findings
do
properly
show
such
policy.
in
other
race
discrimination
fields,
most
notably
in
cases
involving
exclusion
of
blacks
from
jury
service,
the
courts
regard
a
prima
facie
case
is
proved
and
there
showed
to
be
a
general
pattern
exclusion
that
has
been
an
opportunity
to
discriminate.
the
alexander
against
louisiana
on
last
term
exemplifies
that
type
of
approach
and
we
think
something
that
identical
but
some
sort
of
similar
approach.
the
development
of
a
prima
facie
case
is
obviously
necessary
in
this
field,
but
the
fifth
circuit's
recent
decisions,
en
banc
decisions
in
the
austin,
texas
and
the
corpus
christi
case
reject
this
idea
which
is
advanced
by
the
briefs,
briefs
of
the
united
states,
and
the
briefs
of
school
board
in
this
case
that
it's
necessary
to
prove
segregation
by
approving
the
discriminatory
act
in
every
single
school
in
the
system.
the
fifth
circuit
points
out
that
such
a
rule
has
never
been
argued
by
the
government
before
in
the
whole
history
of
school
cases.
it
wasn't
long
ago
that
united
states
was
pioneering
state-wide
school
desegregation
case
against
alabama
and
georgia
and
--
and
this
new
notion
that
you
have
to
prove
school
by
school
was
a
plain
reversal
where
judge
wisdom
said
was
the
tried
and
true
method
of
proving
school
segregation,
namely
the
act.
now,
the
proponents
of
the
school
by
school
approach
must
know
that
they're
demandingly
impossible,
that
such
a
rule
would
virtually
immunize
most
school
segregation
for
the
challenge.
i
mean
school
boards
don't
keep
records
and
--
and
very
long
on
this
issues,
and
in
this
case
they
weren't
any
even
maps
of
attendance
those
in
denver
prior
to
1960
and
it
had
to
be
reconstructed
by
very
laborious
and
painstaking
process.
and
the
basic
figures,
statistics
about
racial
counting
in
schools.
last
thing,
that's
a
sort
of
thing
that
weren't
available
for
many
relevant
years.
now,
my
second
argument
is
that
the
pattern
of
segregation
was
even
wider
than
the
courts
below
actually
held
because
of
some
of
the
legal
rulings.
we
think
that
the
evidence
shows
that
manual
high
school,
manual
training
high
school
is
in
the
classic
pattern.
i
was
about
to
use
the
word
of
swann,
it
was
school
that
was
established
for
one
race
set
up
for
minority
group
pupils
and
planned
as
such.
now,
on
that
collective
brief
of
the
solicitor
general
supports
that
contention
that
new
manual
was
established
as
a
minority
school
with
explicit
racial
segregations.
the
little
book
which
is
excerpted
in
the
record
published
by
the
school
board
when
manual
was
being
planned,
explained
in
exhibit
356
makes
it
obvious
that
manual
really
was
planned
for
black
and
hispano
students
as
thus
the
testimony
by
the
--
by
the
then
superintendent,
mr.
(inaudible)
the
book
had
said
that
in
essence
that
manual
was
going
to
be
different.
this
is
back
in
--
in
the
early
1950s
before
brown
was
planned,
manual
is
going
to
be
different.
the
people
were
building
the
school
for
replacing
the
older
building,
special
problems
residing
there.
they
had
a
long
--
in
the
book
they
had
a
long
history
of
the
racial
composition
of
the
school
and
have
gradually
changed
from
white
to
a
majority
of
black
and
hispano.
so,
because
of
the
manual's
different
population,
they
were
planning
a
different
curriculum.
now,
judge
doyle
condemned
the
similar
planning
of
a
school
in
barrett
after
brown
but
for
some
reason,
he
focused
on
the
fact
that
manual
was
planned
before
brown
as
a
minority
school
and
we
think
that's
the
wrong
point
that
even
though
what
the
school
board
was
doing
didn't
violate
the
law
of
the
land
back
before
brown,
they
nevertheless
were
engaging
in
explicitly
racial
considerations.
and
brown
applies
just
as
much
here
as
it
does
in
states
which
had
segregation
laws.
there
really
isn't
time
to
go
into
the
evidence
about
manual
about
the
subsequent
boundary
changes,
but
sufficient
to
say
judge
doyle
never
found
that
these
boundary
changes
were
rational
justified
in
annual
basis
–
let's
get
about
some
other
boundary
changes.
but
only
that
he
applied
some
sort
of
a
notion
about
the
burden
of
proof
which
we
say
and
argue
in
more
detail
in
our
brief
this
cast
the
burden
of
proof.
a
point
not
made
very
clearly
in
the
briefs
is
the
integral
relationship
that
manual
atop
the
feeder
pattern
of
11
elementary
schools
in
the
court
area
plus
co-junior
high
school
which
feed
pupils
into
manual.
segregating
manual,
establishing
it
as
a
black
school
atop
all
these
schools
feeding
into
it
obviously
is
going
to
have
an
influence
on
those
other
schools.
i
mean,
a
white
person
living
in
one
of
these
feeder
schools
who
wanted
to
avoid
for
each
child
the
school
which
the
board
had
set
up
there's
the
minority.
high
school
is
obviously
induced
to
move
out
of
the
feeder
school
areas.
so,
those
are
--
if
you're
interested
in
what
the
percentages
are,
if
you
add
manually,
its
feeder
pattern
for
the
northeast
denver
schools,
then
you
really
do
have
74%
of
the
black
in
school
system
involved
in
illegal
segregation.
mr.
james
m.
nabritt
iii
well,
the
feeder
schools
for
manual
are
mitchell,
gilpin,
swansea,
harrington,
columbine,
ebert,
whittier,
crofton,
elyria,
garden
place,
and
wyatt.
i
would
like
to
conclude
by
reemphasizing
the
passage
of
swann
which
points
out
that
school
authority's
decisions
about
construction,
location,
size
of
school,
and
then
what
kind
of
policies
and
triple
assignment
there
will
be
will
determine
the
racial
composition
of
the
student
by
in
each
school
and
assistant.
it's
the
school
board's
decisions
that
determine
the
racial
composition.
they
define
the
neighborhoods
for
--
the
neighborhood
school
policy.
they
constantly
redefine
what
the
neighborhoods
are
so
that
at
the
very
least,
our
submission
is
where
a
school
district
is
found
to
be
engaged
in
using
chance
and
centrifuges.
the
burden
shifts
to
the
board
to
show
that
schools
which
look
at
every
respect
like
the
schools
they
found
to
have
been
illegally
segregated
except
that
they
have
some
rational
explanation
are
justified
by
some
compelling
interest
of
the
state
and
that
the
state's
interest
could
not
have
been
served
by
less
segregatory
results.
denver
had
integration
alternatives
in
every
step
and
always
rejected
them
and
chose
segregation.
mr.
james
m.
nabritt
iii
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice.
may
it
please
the
court.
we
see
the
whole
case
as
a
de
jure
case.
i
think
that
the
relationship
between
our
two
arguments
is
very
well
illustrated
by
this
court's
decision
in
1965
in
the
case
called
rogers
against
paul.
that
was
the
case
to
desegregating
in
arkansas
school
system,
where
the
desegregation
was
proceeding
at
a
greater
year
of
level
under
the
deliberate
speed
doctrine.
and
yet,
when
black
pupils
in
the
high
school
grades
were
able
to
demonstrate
in
this
court
that
they
were
unable
to
get
classes
and
curriculum
in
the
black
school
that
was
offered
in
the
white
school,
this
court
carved
down
an
exception
to
the
deliberate
speed
doctrine
and
said,
“under
brown
or
under
swett,
paid
her
under
a
combination
or
merger
of
the
two
theories,
this
was
a
violation
of
equal
protection
with
few
remedy
by
integration.”
now,
the
remedy
in
the
swett
case
was
integration,
the
remedy
in
the
(inaudible)
case
was
integration
and
it
wasn't
just
based
on
some
sort
of
theory
of
achievement
that
human
sweat
might
graduate
from
law
school
and
not
be
a
lawyer.
the
inequality
was
in
the
--
the
opportunity
he
had
and
the
barriers
are
put
in
front.
so,
we
represent
the
constitutional
rights
and
claimers,
the
deprivation
for
the
students
that
fetches
at
the
top
of
the
class
at
manual
as
well
as
the
student
that
does
speak
well.
now,
we
think
that
for
any
quasi
justice
is
just
for
segregation.
there
should
be
no
single
doctrine
or
remedy
for
inequality
and
we
don't
urge
that
sort
of
a
proposition.
what
we
urge
is
that
judge
doyle
was
at
least
with
him
at
the
discretion
and
listening
to
this
evidence
and
listening
to
the
particulars
of
how
the
school
board
said
they
would
going
to
remedy
the
inequality,
they
concluded
--
well,
it
doesn't
--
it
won't
hold
order
or
maybe
(inaudible)
the
way
that
seems
most
official,
most
sure
to
accomplish
equality
is
to
put
the
pupils
in
school
together,
and
it
was
that
sort
of
overall
judgment,
we
think
judge
doyle
may.
about
the
question
from
the
court
about
the
age
of
the
buildings,
what
judge
doyle
said
at
page
61
in
313
federal
supplement
is,
“however,
we
do
not
think
that
the
age
of
a
building
and
cite
sizes
are
in
and
off
themselves
substantial
facts
as
affecting
the
educational
opportunity
offered
at
a
given
school.
however,
we
do
recognize
that
in
schools
which
are
segregated,
have
less
experienced
teachers,
produce
generally
low
achieving
students.
the
fact
that
the
physical
plan
is
old
may
aggravate
the
aura
of
inferiority
which
surrounds
the
school.”
and
we
are
talking
about
the
19th
century
schools.
we're
talking
about
schools
that
are
built
in
the
last
century
which
in
--
in
the
old
part
of
the
city.
mr.
justice
powell
asked
the
question
about
the
busing
statistics.
they
are
set
out
at
page
26
of
our
brief.
in
addition,
there
are
two
maps
in
the
original
record
not
pretty
less
but
large
amounts
which
show
the
bus
routes.
they
are
plaintiffs'
exhibits
390a
and
390b,
which
they
show
the
people's
crisscrossing
the
city.
there
is
one
exhibit
about
manual
which
is
printed.
that's
the
school
of
booklet
that
the
school
board
are
published
before
they
set
up
the
school.
it
shows
what
they
were
doing.
it
shows
the
establishment
of
a
dual
school.
and
these
are
only
excerpts
from
the
booklet
printed
here
but
the
whole
is
in
the
record
filed
with
the
clerk.
on
this
question
of
the
decision,
judge
--
with
the
no
fancy
constitutional
theory,
it
is
necessary
to
support
judge
doyle's
conclusion
that
what
this
showed
in
the
factual
context
of
the
case
in
the
series
of
things
that
got
going
on
with
relation
to
these
schools
was
what
judge
doyle
said
with
both
of
purpose
and
effect
to
keep
black
get
segregated
as
they
are
not
his
family.
so,
--
mr.
james
m.
nabritt
iii
mr.
justice
powell,
i
would
give
my
answer
by
saying
that
--
i'm
dividing
the
two
parts.
i'll
say,
first
on
the
state
action
question
that
we
agreed
entirely
with
the
process
of
solicitor
general.
it's
the
state
running
the
schools
that
they
determined
the
racial
composition
of
the
schools,
so
the
real
question
is
whether
or
not
there's
been
discrimination
which
violates
the
constitution
on
this
record.
and
i
would
say
that
it
is
not
--
i
would
say
first
that
it
is
not
necessary
on
the
record
to
reach
that
issue
of
whether
or
not
--
whether
or
not
segregation
is
illegal
if
there
was
no
racial
discrimination.
but
on
that
question,
i
would
think
that
certainly,
discrimination
is
inferable
from
the
facts,
the
facts
that
both
courts
below
agreed
to.
that
--
that
there
is
segregation
pattern,
that
the
school
board
did
have
all
these
opportunity
and
control,
that
there
was
widespread
--
spread
bias
in
the
system
and
that
--
and
because
of
the
known
inequality
of
the
schools.
now,
there
is
one
--
one
absence
in
--
in
this
record
and
that
is
the
absence
of
any
--
of
any
evidence
about
the
important
factor
which
is
what
caused
the
--
the
housing
segregation,
whether
that
--
government
was
responsible
for
that.
there
are
other
cases
they
litigated
where
they
are
including
some
pending
on
certiorari
where
that
--
that
question
has
been
--
that
has
been
addressed
in
evidence
and
--
and
that
fact
findings
by
the
courts
on
it.
we
--
we
don't
think
it's
necessary
to
--
to
reach
that
--
mr.
james
m.
nabritt
iii
that
--
that
wasn't
litigated
here
because
we've
placed
it
at
the
jury
--
mr.
james
m.
nabritt
iii
but
that
was
their
--
that
was
their
holding
that
they
find
themselves.
mr.
james
m.
nabritt
iii
well
--
if
this
--
faced
with
that
decision,
and
i
--
i
would
still
argue
that
we
should
win
the
case.
and
based
on
that
--
mr.
james
m.
nabritt
iii
well,
i
mean
i
would
--
i'd
be
willing
to
follow
it
up
to
--
to
its
logical
conclusion
if
i
had
to,
but
that
the
inequality
argument
justifies
relief
without
regard
to
--
to
--
and
--and
indeed
that
the
school
board
so
can
--
really
does
control
the
racial
composition
of
a
school.
mr.
james
m.
nabritt
iii
well,
i
--
i
don't
--
i
don't
envision
any
real
--
realistic
record
as
involving
only
inaction
but
determining
hard
and
that
--
that
certainly
might
be
part
of
it.
mr.
james
m.
nabritt
iii
let
us
say
they
make
--
they
make
decisions.
mr.
james
m.
nabritt
iii
i
--
i
think
that
as
a
--as
a
matter
of
--
of
making
a
prima
facie
case
of
--
of
violation
of
the
constitution,
that
plaintiffs
can
do
it
by
showing
whether
it
is
a
substantive
rule
or
not,
i
don't
know.
certainly,
in
terms
of
--
of
making
out
a
prima
facie
case,
a
discrimination,
plaintiffs
can
do
it
without
showing
what
the
court
of
appeals
called
odious
intent.
maybe
the
--
the
--
if
--
if
the
court,
i
don't
know
any
other
answer,
mr.
justice
stewart.
i'm
not
trying
to
evade
the
question.
it's
certainly
open
to
the
court
to
reach
the
de
facto
issue
here
if
it
--
if
it
so
chose,
i
--
i
would
think.
what
we
are
urging
is
that
it's
not
necessary
and
--
and
if
the
court
found
it
necessary
to
reach
that
issue,
then
we
would
urge
that
--
that
in
any
of
that,
we
should
win
the
case
that
--
that
whatever
discriminatory
intent
or
--
or
if
discriminatory
intent
or
at
least
intent
is
necessary
that
it's
inferable
for
a
prima
facie
case
which
requires
that
the
--
that
it
be
rebutted.
mr.
james
m.
nabritt
iii
i
--
i
would
argue
the
proposition
alternatively
as
a
question
of
approving
a
prima
facie
case,
i
know
is
a
substantive
question
of
substitute
law.
i
--
i
think
that
the
school
board
is
really
--
are
controlling
the
race
and
composition
of
the
schools,
and
that
--
and
that
segregation
and
deliberate
segregation
is
widespread.
so
that
when
you
show
an
element
such
as
what
we
have
here,
a
situation
to
use
judge
doyle's
phrase
that
looks
just
as
if
they
deliberately
segregate
and
--and
if
judge
doyle
said,
“the
results
are
just
the
same,”
as
if
they
had
a
segregation
policy,
but
what
i
find
here
is
that
they
had
a)
an
explanation,
a
rational
justification
for
this.
i
say
that's
not
enough,
that
they
have
to
have
a
compelling
justification
for
producing
this
kind
of
segregatory
result
whether
they
--
with
or
without
an
attempt.
i
hope
that's
the
complete
answer.
i
know
i've
gone
over
my
time
mr.
chief
justice.
