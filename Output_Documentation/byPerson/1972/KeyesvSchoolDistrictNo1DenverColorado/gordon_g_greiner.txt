mr.
gordon
g.
greiner
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
my
argument
will
consider
the
issue
of
denver's
provision
of
the
inferior
schools
and
schooling
for
minority
children
who
are
black
or
hispano
and
the
provision
of
superior
schools
and
schooling
for
anglo
children
as
constituting
a
denial
of
equal
protection
under
the
fourteenth
amendment.
that
was
the
finding
and
holding
of
the
trial
court
below
in
this
case
after
considering
comparative
evidence
of
tangible
educational
inputs
and
outputs,
as
well
as
evidence
of
the
perceptions
of
principals,
teachers,
pupils,
and
the
community
and
in
about
the
schools.
mr.
nabrit
has
already
covered
many
of
the
policies
and
practices
of
the
respondents
which
created
and
contributed
to
the
racially
identifiable
isolated
status
of
these
schools.
the
segregated
condition,
which
resulted
from
those
actions,
is
also
irrelevant
to
the
question
of
education
and
equality.
but
i
will
consider
here
only
other
practices
and
policies
which
also
contributed
to
the
inferior
status
of
the
schools
as
educational
institutions.
i
wish
to
cover
the
following
–
mr.
gordon
g.
greiner
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
we
are
not
at
all
dependent
on
the
finding
of
inequality
as
being
premised
on
brown
situation
of
the
jury
segregation.
mr.
gordon
g.
greiner
certainly.
certainly,
but
that's
right.
this
–
mr.
gordon
g.
greiner
that's
correct.
mr.
gordon
g.
greiner
quite
true,
mr.
chief
justice,
that's
right.
and
i
would
like
part
of
my
argument
will
present
some
of
the
types
of
disparities
in
the
allocations
of
resources
to
these
schools
which
we
believe
clearly
violates
every
holding
of
this
court's
sense
of
blessing.
i
would
also
like
to
cover,
as
a
second
point
of
my
argument,
the
contention
that
a
need
for
education
for
minorities
and
racially
identifiable
inferior
schools
denies
equal
protection.
and
finally,
that
the
trial
court
formulated
a
remedy
for
these
unequal
and
desperate
conditions
which
met
the
standards
and
thoroughness,
the
efficiency,
fairness,
and
rapidity
while
focusing
only
upon
those
characteristics
of
the
system
which
he
felt
led
to
the
violation
as
he
proceeded.
now,
with
regard
to
the
schools
in
question,
the
minority
schools
are
shown
on
the
map.
now,
27
of
them
to
which
some
20,000
minority
children
are
assigned,
each
of
these
schools
have
annual
enrollments
often
29
to
only
1%.
the
red
dots
on
the
map
represent
those
with
the
hispano
enrollment
or
a
black
enrollment
in
excess
of
70%.
mr.
gordon
g.
greiner
the
red
dots
–
first
of
all
the
red
dots
are
schools
that
have
either
70%
black
or
70%
hispano.
the
blue
dots
are
some
additional
schools
which
we
feel
should
also
be
covered
by
the
findings
of
violation
and
that
are
entitled
to
the
remedy
whose
racial
composition
show
a
combined
70%
or
more
negro-hispano
involvement.
these
schools
have
over
40%
of
the
hispano
students
in
denver
and
over
86%
of
the
district's
negro
students
but
only
5%
of
the
districts
anglo
students.
there
are
22
elementary
schools,
four
junior
high
schools
in
manual
training
high
school
involved
here.
in
considering
what
these
schools
were
like,
well,
mr.
nabrit
has
described
how
the
administration
refused
to
transport
anglos
and
of
these
schools
that
how
they
refused
to
reassign
minority
children
out
of
them.
i
would
like
to
tell
you
a
little
bit
about
what
the
record
and
findings
below
tell
us
about
the
conditions
of
the
schools.
the
minority
student
in
denver
found
themselves
assigned
to
the
school
which
had
twice
as
many
brand
of
teachers,
twice
as
many
probationary
teachers
and
only
half
as
many
teachers
with
10
or
more
years
experience
as
compared
with
the
predominantly
anglo
schools
in
the
district.
the
--
this
was
the
result
of
the
administration's
own
policies
regarding
the
assignment
of
new
teachers
in
the
district
as
well
as
the
board's
policies
regarding
teacher
transfers
whereby
teachers
were
recorded
preference
based
upon
seniority.
so,
let
us
assume
the
teacher
had
some
seniority
in
school,
she
would
then
be
first
in
line
eligible
for
transfer
out.
mr.
gordon
g.
greiner
yes,
as
--
mr.
gordon
g.
greiner
well,
prior
to
1966,
the
contract
provided
that
teachers
assigned
to
a
school,
new
teachers,
had
to
remain
in
the
school
for
at
least
their
three-year
probationary
period.
after
1966,
the
district
even
abandoned
that
requirement
and
we
contended
that
even
further
contributed
to
(voice
overlap)
mr.
gordon
g.
greiner
yes,
it
was,
it
was.
mr.
gordon
g.
greiner
however
--
mr.
gordon
g.
greiner
that's
true
but
it
was
not
an
absolute
right
that
the
board
retained
the
power
to
both
initiate
and
disapprove
of
transfer
request
under
the
standard
of
whatever
they
felt
was
best
for
the
interest
of
the
school
district.
however,
the
evidence
here
shows
that
the
board
and
the
school
administration
never
exercised
that
power
toward
the
goal
of
either
stabilizing
the
teaching
staffs
in
these
schools
or
raising
the
level
of
teacher
experience
in
them.
mr.
gordon
g.
greiner
if
in
their
judgment
it
was
not
in
the
best
interest
of
the
district,
that
was
the
standard.
mr.
gordon
g.
greiner
well,
even
if
it
meant
something,
certainly,
there
was
sufficient
power
reserved
to
the
school
administration
to
take
some
kinds
of
affirmative
action
to
remedy
the
situation
that
existed
in
these
minority
schools,
both
regard
with
regard
to
trying
to
improve
the
level
of
experience
there,
as
well
as
trying
to
reduce
the
rate
of
turnover
there.
judge
doyle,
in
considering
the
turnover
rate
in
these
minority
schools,
found
that
it
was
so
high
that
it
was
actually
disruptive
of
the
educational
process
going
on
in
those
schools.
and
he
also
found
that
this
constant
flight
of
teachers
out
of
these
schools
contributed
to
the
aura
of
inferiority
which
surrounded
the
school
and
reinforced
the
students'
perceptions
that
somehow
his
school
was
a
place
of
less
choice.
with
regard
to
achievement
data,
the
administration
refused
to
disclose
comparative
by
school
achievement
data
for
over
20
years
that
failed
not
only
to
disclose
it
to
the
community
but
even
refused
to
disclose
it
to
members
of
the
board
of
education
as
well.
while
the
predominantly
anglo
schools
were
achieving
on
the
basis
of
national
averages
at
or
above
the
60th
percentile
in
general,
the
minority
schools
were
only
achieving
at
around
the
20th
percentile.
the
administration
nevertheless
praised
the
high
achievement
in
the
anglo
schools
and
the
low
achievement
in
the
minority
schools
in
exactly
the
same
glowing
terms.
we
have
quoted
some
instances
of
this
in
our
brief.
now,
this
honor
and
praise
by
the
school
administration,
both
obfuscated
the
disparity
and
minority
achievement,
and
we
maintain
also
created
and
reinforced
teachers'
acceptance
of
low
achievement
that's
not
only
the
inevitable
but
appropriate
result
of
these
minority
schools.
the
evidence
shows
that
the
administrations
set
uniformly
low
expectancy
standards
with
regard
to
achievement
in
these
minority
schools.
in
our
brief
at
pages
50
and
51
in
footnote
57,
we
show
14
of
the
schools
all
with
the
established
expected
achievement
levels
and
it
sat
a
uniform
23
percentile.
at
the
same
time,
the
school
district
was
setting
expectancy
at
about
the
50%
to
70%
range
in
the
predominantly
anglo
schools.
now,
because
they
have
been
conditioned
by
the
administration's
expectancy
standards,
minority
student
found
that
his
teachers
did
not
expect
very
much
of
him
that
he
was
neither
challenged
or
motivated
to
do
better.
although
he
didn't
do
very
well,
he
always
seemed
to
be
passed
from
grade
to
grade.
mr.
gordon
g.
greiner
the
expectancy
now
was
according
to
the
school
district,
based
upon
the
calculation
of,
i
believe
the
term
was
the
interquartile
distribution
of
iq
scores
for
the
particular
class
at
that
particular
school.
mr.
gordon
g.
greiner
not
on
the
actual
experience
in
the
schools,
that's
correct.
mr.
gordon
g.
greiner
now,
i
would
like
to
go
on
to
our
second
point
concerning
the
law
which
we
believe
should
apply
to
this
case.
while
the
trial
court
did
not
find
it
necessary
to
hold
either
that
the
segregation
in
these
schools
or
their
educational
inequalities
were
the
product
of
racial
prejudice
or
odious
intent,
he
nevertheless
recognized
them
to
be.
the
direct
effect
to
the
state
action
and
held
that
its
effect
discriminated
against
blacks
and
hispanos
but
by
denying
them
an
equal
opportunity
for
an
education.
thus,
our
case
is
very
similar
to
such
longstanding
precedence
of
sweatt
versus
painter
when
the
court
was
determining
whether
white
and
black
facilities
were
substantially
equal
under
the
old
plessy
doctrine.
the
factors
considered
by
this
court
included
the
reputation
of
the
school,
the
overall
quality
of
the
institution
as
to
faculty
in
the
facilities
and
even
is
reasonably
as
this
court's
decision
in
swann,
the
court
pointed
as
a
substantive
constitutional
violation
of
the
equal
protection
to
disparities
where
schools
do
not
have
like
qualities,
facilities,
or
staffs.
this,
we
maintain
is
exactly
the
kind
of
case
found
and
proved
below.
i
would
like
now
to
pass
on
to
the
question
of
the
appropriateness
of
the
remedy
which
was
finally
put
together
by
judge
doyle
after
a
separate
four-day
hearing
on
relief.
i'd
like
to
remind
the
court
that
historically,
since
brown
ii,
the
court
has
looked
to
and
relied
upon
the
trial
court's
exercise
of
discretion
in
fashioning
appropriate
remedies
in
school
cases
and
has
consistently
resisted
efforts
to
limit
the
tools
available
to
the
trial
court
in
formulating
an
effective
remedy.
in
this
case,
judge
doyle
was
faced
with
a
practical
problem
of
carrying
multitude
inequalities
of
input
environment
and
output
as
thoroughly,
efficiently,
and
promptly
as
possible.
here,
he
did
not
take
any
doctrinaire
approach
but
carefully
put
together
a
very
(inaudible)
based
on
the
realities
of
the
characteristics
of
the
violations
he
perceived
on.
this
broad
choice
of
remedy
was
made
after
a
special
four-day
hearing
in
may
wherein
the
court's
words,
the
crucial
factual
issue
of
considering
is
whether
compensatory
education
in
a
segregated
setting
is
capable
of
bringing
about
the
necessary
equalizing
effects
or
whether
desegregation
and
integration
are
essential
to
improving
the
schools
in
question
and
providing
equality.
this
was
not,
as
applied
by
the
solicitor
general's
brief,
a
decision
made
in
a
vacuum
because
the
trial
court
had
had
before
it
a
detailed
plan
of
the
board
of
education
submitted
under
resolution
1565
which
was
premised
on
the
very
same
types
of
special
and
compensatory
programs
in
the
segregated
schools
which
the
united
states
contends
here
would
have
been
an
acceptable
alternate
remedy.
but
the
evidence
presented
at
this
hearing
on
relief
established
that
minority
achievement
is
improved
and
integrated
heterogenous
environment
that
attitude
no
disparities
and
disadvantages
such
as
teacher
expectancy,
teacher
dislike
for
the
segregated
school
and
so
forth
are
only
corrected
through
a
combined
program
of
integration,
desegregation,
and
then
a
compensatory
program
in
the
integrated
environment.
thank
you.
mr.
gordon
g.
greiner
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
my
argument
will
consider
the
issue
of
denver's
provision
of

inferior

was,
it
was.
mr.
gordon
g.
greiner
however
--
mr.
gordon
g.
greiner
that's
true
but
it
was
not
an
absolute
right
that
the
board
retained
the
power
to
both
initiate
and
disapprove
of
transfer
request
under
the
standard
of
whatever
they
felt
was
best
for
the
interest
of
the
school
district.
however,
the
evidence
here
shows
that
the
board
and
the
school
administration
never
exercised
that
power
toward
the
goal
of
either
stabilizing
the
teaching
staffs
in
these
schools
or
raising
the
level
of
teacher
experience
in
them.
mr.
gordon
g.
greiner
if
in
their
judgment
it
was
not
in
the
best
interest
of
the
district,
that
was
the
standard.
mr.
gordon
g.
greiner
well,
even
if
it
meant
something,
certainly,
there
was
sufficient
power
reserved
to
the
school
administration
to
take
some
kinds
of
affirmative
action
to
remedy
the
situation
that
existed
in
these
minority
schools,
both
regard
with
regard
to
trying
to
improve
the
level
of
experience
there,
as
well
as
trying
to
reduce
the
rate
of
turnover
there.
judge
doyle,
in
considering
the
turnover
rate
in
these
minority
schools,
found
that
it
was
so
high
that
it
was
actually
disruptive
of
the
educational
process
going
on
in
those
schools.
and
he
also
found
that
this
constant
flight
of
teachers
out
of
these
schools
contributed
to
the
aura
of
inferiority
which
surrounded
the
school
and
reinforced
the
students'
perceptions
that
somehow
his
school
was
a
place
of
less
choice.
with
regard
to
achievement
data,
the
administration
refused
to
disclose
comparative
by
school
achievement
data
for
over
20
years
that
failed
not
only
to
disclose
it
to
the
community
but
even
refused
to
disclose
it
to
members
of
the
board
of
education
as
well.
while
the
predominantly
anglo
schools
were
achieving
on
the
basis
of
national
averages
at
or
above
the
60th
percentile
in
general,
the
minority
schools
were
only
achieving
at
around
the
20th
percentile.
the
administration
nevertheless
praised
the
high
achievement
in
the
anglo
schools
and
the
low
achievement
in
the
minority
schools
in
exactly
the
same
glowing
terms.
we
have
quoted
some
instances
of
this
in
our
brief.
now,
this
honor
and
praise
by
the
school
administration,
both
obfuscated
the
disparity
and
minority
achievement,
and
we
maintain
also
created
and
reinforced
teachers'
acceptance
of
low
achievement
that's
not
only
the
inevitable
but
appropriate
result
of
these
minority
schools.
the
evidence
shows
that
the
administrations
set
uniformly
low
expectancy
standards
with
regard
to
achievement
in
these
minority
schools.
in
our
brief
at
pages
50
and
51
in
footnote
57,
we
show
14
of
the
schools
all
with
the
established
expected
achievement
levels
and
it
sat
a
uniform
23
percentile.
at
the
same
time,
the
school
district
was
setting
expectancy
at
about
the
50%
to
70%
range
in
the
predominantly
anglo
schools.
now,
because
they
have
been
conditioned
by
the
administration's
expectancy
standards,
minority
student
found
that
his
teachers
did
not
expect
very
much
of
him
that
he
was
neither
challenged
or
motivated
to
do
better.
although
he
didn't
do
very
well,
he
always
seemed
to
be
passed
from
grade
to
grade.
mr.
gordon
g.
greiner
the
expectancy
now
was
according
to
the
school
district,
based
upon
the
calculation
of,
i
believe
the
term
was
the
interquartile
distribution
of
iq
scores
for
the
particular
class
at
that
particular
school.
mr.
gordon
g.
greiner
not
on
the
actual
experience
in
the
schools,
that's
correct.
mr.
gordon
g.
greiner
now,
i
would
like
to
go
on
to
our
second
point
concerning
the
law
which
we
believe
should
apply
to
this
case.
while
the
trial
court
did
not
find
it
necessary
to
hold
either
that
the
segregation
in
these
schools
or
their
educational
inequalities
were
the
product
of
racial
prejudice
or
odious
intent,
he
nevertheless
recognized
them
to
be.
the
direct
effect
to
the
state
action
and
held
that
its
effect
discriminated
against
blacks
and
hispanos
but
by
denying
them
an
equal
opportunity
for
an
education.
thus,
our
case
is
very
similar
to
such
longstanding
precedence
of
sweatt
versus
painter
when
the
court
was
determining
whether
white
and
black
facilities
were
substantially
equal
under
the
old
plessy
doctrine.
the
factors
considered
by
this
court
included
the
reputation
of
the
school,
the
overall
quality
of
the
institution
as
to
faculty
in
the
facilities
and
even
is
reasonably
as
this
court's
decision
in
swann,
the
court
pointed
as
a
substantive
constitutional
violation
of
the
equal
protection
to
disparities
where
schools
do
not
have
like
qualities,
facilities,
or
staffs.
this,
we
maintain
is
exactly
the
kind
of
case
found
and
proved
below.
i
would
like
now
to
pass
on
to
the
question
of
the
appropriateness
of
the
remedy
which
was
finally
put
together
by
judge
doyle
after
a
separate
four-day
hearing
on
relief.
i'd
like
to
remind
the
court
that
historically,
since
brown
ii,
the
court
has
looked
to
and
relied
upon
the
trial
court's
exercise
of
discretion
in
fashioning
appropriate
remedies
in
school
cases
and
has
consistently
resisted
efforts
to
limit
the
tools
available
to
the
trial
court
in
formulating
an
effective
remedy.
in
this
case,
judge
doyle
was
faced
with
a
practical
problem
of
carrying
multitude
inequalities
of
input
environment
and
output
as
thoroughly,
efficiently,
and
promptly
as
possible.
here,
he
did
not
take
any
doctrinaire
approach
but
carefully
put
together
a
very
(inaudible)
based
on
the
realities
of
the
characteristics
of
the
violations
he
perceived
on.
this
broad
choice
of
remedy
was
made
after
a
special
four-day
hearing
in
may
wherein
the
court's
words,
the
crucial
factual
issue
of
considering
is
whether
compensatory
education
in
a
segregated
setting
is
capable
of
bringing
about
the
necessary
equalizing
effects
or
whether
desegregation
and
integration
are
essential
to
improving
the
schools
in
question
and
providing
equality.
this
was
not,
as
applied
by
the
solicitor
general's
brief,
a
decision
made
in
a
vacuum
because
the
trial
court
had
had
before
it
a
detailed
plan
of
the
board
of
education
submitted
under
resolution
1565
which
was
premised
on
the
very
same
types
of
special
and
compensatory
programs
in
the
segregated
schools
which
the
united
states
contends
here
would
have
been
an
acceptable
alternate
remedy.
but
the
evidence
presented
at
this
hearing
on
relief
established
that
minority
achievement
is
improved
and
integrated
heterogenous
environment
that
attitude
no
disparities
and
disadvantages
such
as
teacher
expectancy,
teacher
dislike
for
the
segregated
school
and
so
forth
are
only
corrected
through
a
combined
program
of
integration,
desegregation,
and
then
a
compensatory
program
in
the
integrated
environment.
thank
you.
