justice
potter
stewart
well
the
--
that
the
--
the
courts
below
--
both
of
them,
as
i
understand
it,
thought
that
so
far
as
the
core
area
of
denver
went
there
was
a
de
facto
and
not
a
de
jury
segregation.
justice
potter
stewart
am
i
mistaken
about
that?
justice
potter
stewart
assuming
no
de
jure
segregation,
is
that
correct,
that
--
that
branch
of
the
argument?
justice
potter
stewart
well
then
there
was
an
election,
which
is
material
to
this
case,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
no,
but
there
was.
that
--
that's
what
caused
the
precision
of
the
--
of
a
plan
wasn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
an
election
of
the
school.
justice
potter
stewart
implicate
more
than
what,
mr.
narbit?
justice
potter
stewart
i
understand
that
your
argument
would
stand
independently
of
any
evidence
of
the
injurious
segregation.
justice
potter
stewart
the
jury,
of
course
includes
the
action
by
the
school
board.
justice
potter
stewart
your
argument
is
quite
apart
from
any
evidence
of
that.
justice
potter
stewart
was
--
the
expectancy
was
based
on
experience
from
school,
right?
justice
potter
stewart
not
on
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
experience
expressed
in
here.
justice
potter
stewart
were
the
school
--
was
the
school
population
be
--
correlate
pretty
well
with
the
total
population?
justice
potter
stewart
the
percentage?
justice
potter
stewart
went
up
by
40%.
justice
potter
stewart
were
--
were
hispanos
identified
only
by
their
--
by
their
names?
justice
potter
stewart
is
that
the
way
they
have
been
identified
in
this
case?
justice
potter
stewart
(inaudible)
justice
potter
stewart
it
was
an
area
of
high
school
always,
wasn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
i
mean
the
high
schools
as
well
as
the
elementary
and
junior
high
schools
have
been
neighborhood.
justice
potter
stewart
now,
look
down
there.
how
many
high
schools
were
there?
justice
potter
stewart
among
the
five,
manual
is
the
only
one
which
was
predominantly
non-anglo?
justice
potter
stewart
it
was
the
only
in
high
school
that
was
--
that
had
a
majority
of
non-anglo.
justice
potter
stewart
and
it
--
was
there
any
--
was
there
any
high
school
in
the
--
among
the
five
that
were
presently
among
the
nine
that
was
at
the
other
hand
of
the
spectrum
in
its
orientation
that
was
a
college
preparatory
school?
justice
potter
stewart
one
or
more
than
one?
justice
potter
stewart
are
in
the
south.
justice
potter
stewart
and
those
schools
too
were
--
even
though
they
were
high
schools,
they
were
neighborhood
schools.
justice
potter
stewart
there
was
no
opportunity
for
a
young
man
or
woman
interested
in
getting
a
college
preparatory
or
oriented
to
high
school
education
who
lived
in
the
core
area
in
going
to
one
of
these
schools.
there's
no
opportunity
at
all,
is
that
right?
justice
potter
stewart
all
right.
as
i
understood,
the
--
what
the
court
of
appeals
did
was,
as
you
just
said,
not
to
decide
whether
or
not
the
rescission
was
itself
a
violation.
justice
potter
stewart
but
putting
that
question
alongside,
simply
said
that
the
original
plan
was
in
fact
a
remedy,
isn't
that
what
the
court
of
appeals
did?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
the
court
of
appeals
didn't
pass.
justice
potter
stewart
it
did
not
decide
on
whether
or
not
the
rescission
was
by
itself
a
constitutional
violation.
that's
corrected
and
applied.
the
court
of
appeals
feel
it
did
have
to
pass
on
that.
justice
potter
stewart
--
and
approved
the
district
court's
remedy
in
that
area.
justice
potter
stewart
that's
what
i
thought.
justice
potter
stewart
there's
no
evidence
on
that
in
this
record.
it
wasn't
canvassed
at
all
in
this
case?
justice
potter
stewart
and
i
asked
you
--
yeah,
i
don't
--
i
really
don't
understand
your
answer
so
far
to
mr.
justice
powell's
question.
let's
assume
that
we
accept
the
findings
of
two
courts
below
that
there
was
no
de
jure
segregation
in
the
core
area
of
denver.
those
were
the
findings
of
the
two
courts,
is
that
correct,
in
this
case?
justice
potter
stewart
let's
assume
we
accept
either
because
we
have
to
because
we're
chose
to.
let's
assume
we
accept
that.
then,
does
this
case
present,
as
i
understood
mr.
justice
powell's
question?
does
this
case
present
the
issue
about
whether
or
not
the
distinction
the
court
has
previously
made
between
de
jure
and
de
facto
segregation
is
an
invalid
and
unsupportable
distinction?
justice
potter
stewart
(voice
overlap)
your
question
however.
i'm
sure
you're
arguing
that
i
--
justice
potter
stewart
just
by
denying
that,
even
by
its
inaction
in
the
--
in
the
phase
of
changing
neighborhood
patterns.
by
its
inaction
in
correcting
predominantly
non-
anglo
schools
by
abolishing
the
neighborhood
school
system
that
that's
enough
to
violate
the
constitution,
just
by
standing
by
and
seeing
these
neighborhood
shifts?
justice
potter
stewart
we
began
--
we
began
at
this
point
--
justice
potter
stewart
we
begin
on
this
question
by
assuming
that
they
took
no
affirmative
action
to
segregate.
that's
the
basis
of
mr.
justice
powell's
question.
that
there
was
no
affirmative
segregative
action
on
the
part
of
the
school
board
in
the
core
area.
