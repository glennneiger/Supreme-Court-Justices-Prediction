mr.
william
k.
ris
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i've
listened
with
interest
with
respect
to
some
of
the
facts
that's
been
related
to
the
court
and
would
direct
the
court's
attention
to
basic
fallacy
that
some
of
the
facts
related
extend
many
years
back
prior
to
the
trial
of
this
case
or
the
conditions
as
existed
as
of
the
time
of
the
trial.
both
mr.
nabrit
and
mr.
greiner
have
related
facts
that
should
indicate
on
the
phase
that
we
have
a
static
situation
and
had
a
static
situation
for
a
considerable
period
of
time
when
that
is
not
the
case
whatsoever
with
respect
to
the
denver
--
denver
background.
and
this
assess
the
going
into
some
additional
facts
and
figures
with
respect
to
denver
itself
and
the
school
district,
denver
is
a
home
rule
city
under
the
colorado
constitution.
it
has
the
basic
area.
there
are
many
suburbs
around
it,
but
denver
itself,
at
the
time
of
trial,
consisted
of
an
area
of
about
a
hundred
square
miles
that
had
increased
roughly
40%
after
world
war
ii
by
reason
of
annexations
to
the
city
from
the
surrounding
area.
another
colorado
constitution,
the
school
district
for
the
city
and
county
of
denver
has
exactly
the
same
boundaries
as
the
city
and
county
itself.
and
until
very
recently,
the
school
board
had
absolutely
no
say
so
as
to
what
areas
would
be
brought
into
the
school
district,
yet
the
city
and
country
of
denver
wanted
to
annex
it
came
whether
the
school
district
want
to
do
it
or
not.
very
recently,
that
has
been
changed
but
the
change
is
so
recent
as
not
to
be
contributory.
the
school
board
itself
had
indicated
is
an
elective
body,
seven
members
has
been
for
some
period
of
time.
the
general
area
of
denver
with
the
recent
annexation
shown
on
this
exhibit,
there
are
--
as
indicated
on
the
other
exhibit,
this
was
a
so-called
core
city
area.
the
business
district
being
downtown
and
the
so-called
five
points
area
being
to
the
north
and
east
of
that
area
of
the
downtown
area.
prior
to
world
war
ii,
it
is
true
that
the
black
population
was
well-concentrated
in
the
five
points
area.
after
world
war
ii,
a
completely
different
situation
existed
and
expanded,
and
this
requires
again
some
population
figures.
in
1940,
the
population
in
denver
was
322,000.
in
1970,
at
the
time
of
trial,
it
was
515,000
or
an
increased
of
40%.
now,
in
comparison
to
this
increase
of
40%,
the
black
population
in
1940
was
7,300.
it
increased,
it
just
doubled
in
the
10
years
between
1940
and
1950
and
the
great
bulk
of
this
increase
was
after
world
war
ii.
so
that
is
1950
census.
the
black
population
was
15,000
an
increased
of
100%.
the
next
10
years
--
mr.
william
k.
ris
the
--
no,
sir.
the
--
mr.
william
k.
ris
the
school
population
went
up
during
the
same
period,
justice
potter,
because
of
the
--
basically,
increase
in
--
in
babes
--
post-war
babies
which
we
are
all
familiar.
so
the
--
the
school
population
between
1940
and
1970
are
just
about
double.
whereas
the
--
the
city
population
at
only
40%.
mr.
william
k.
ris
yes
sir.
so,
it
made
little
of
a
difference.
and
the
black
population
itself
doubled
again
between
1950
and
1960,
another
15,000
or
15,000
to
30,000
and
another
17,000
between
1960
and
1970.
so
that
the
--
between
1940
and
1970,
when
the
city
population
was
increasing
40%,
the
black
population
increased
over
600%.
the
hispano
population,
we
do
not
have
comparable
figures,
because
the
1940
census
and
the
1950
census
did
not
separately
count
and
tabulate
--
you
know,
the
hispanos
as
a
group.
they
were
merely
listed
under
anglo,
so,
all
we
have
insofar
as
census
figures
are
concerned,
in
1960,
there
were
60,000
in
the
city,
in
1970,
86,000.
so,
numerically,
they
were
greater
than
the
blacks
but
not
increasing
in
the
--
in
the
same
proportions
as
in
the
progression.
mr.
william
k.
ris
well,
hispanic
surname,
that
probably
is
--
is
the
best
way
of
identification
and
i
think
that's
--
mr.
william
k.
ris
insofar
--
insofar
as
the
--
as
the
school
district
figures
are
concerned,
in
this
case,
they
were
identified
in
this
one
fashion.
shortly
after
school
opened
in
the
fall,
a
call
--
a
call
would
go
out
to
the
principals
to
report
back,
anglos,
negros,
hispanos,
and
orientals.
the
principal
would
ask
the
teachers,
“just
give
me
a--
a
count
of
what
you
think
is
in
your
room,”
and
then
that
would
be
assembled
by
schools
and
have
that
transmitted
in.
so
it's
a
--
it's
a
rather
nebulous
type
of
thing
because
we
have
hispanos,
obviously,
are
ethnic
who
have
names
smith
or
brown
and
we
also
have
non-hispanos
with
--
mr.
william
k.
ris
right,
exactly.
so
it's
--
it's
rough
but
the
school
district
during
the
years
had
to
--
did
keep
this,
this
type
of
census,
had
followed
the
same
pattern.
now,
so
far
as
the
u.s.
census,
i
cannot
answer,
i
just
don't
know.
as
a
result
of
this
influx
and
this
is
where
we
get
into
--
into
a
very
flexible
type
of
situation.
this
is
city
park,
the
square.
it's
about
a
mile
square.
manual
high
is
right
here,
cole
junior
high
just
to
the
north
of
manual.
now,
this
was
the
so-called
five
points
area
until
after
world
war
ii,
the
--
the
black
population
was
quite
well
restricted.
there
were
some
exceptions,
of
course.
the
large
number
of
people
coming
in
and
also
i
think
that
there
is
one
thing
that
--
that
had
a
great
influence
on
this
and
that
was
the
colorado
supreme
court
decision
which
explains
that
in
1957
that
private
racial
covenants
and
deeds
were
void
and
not
enforceable
even
went
through
in
this
court
as
in
--
in
holding
and
an
answer
of
the
court
at
that
time.
so,
beginning
in
--
in
the
late
1940s
when
the
population
influx
began,
york
street,
which
is
just
on
the
east
edge
of
--
of
city
park,
as
of
1950,
and
--
and
then
this
is
again
roughly,
but
it's
best
if
we
can
depict
it,
became
the
easterly
boundary
for
the
black
population.
between
1950
and
1960,
it
extended
along
from
west
to
east
and
again
to
the
north
of
city
park,
so
that
what
previously
was
a
--
a
basically
white
residential
area
became
the
reverse.
and
in
that
particular
area,
for
example,
in
1940,
there
were
only
86
black
citizens
in
that
particular
area.
in
1950,
it
was
898,
but
it
jumped
in
the
next
10
years
to
1960
to
8,700
between
just
to
the
north
of
the
park
and
in
1970,
the
time
of
trial,
it
was
up
to
10,500.
so
that
by
1960,
the
--
the
population
that
--
the
black
population
had
generally
moved
in
and
acquired
substantial
property
in
this
area.
now,
we
come
into
the
park
hill
area
where
you
get
to
the
east
and
extends
from
colorado
boulevard
which
is
the
main
north-south
thoroughfare,
six-lane
main
highway
and
extends
on
up
to
the
airport.
those
of
you
who've
been
to
the
airport,
as
you
come
in,
you
come
right
down
32nd
avenue
parkway
right
through
that
area.
it
was
a
--
a
typical
middle-class,
white
neighborhood,
single-family
dwellings
except
for
monaco
parkway
which
is
more
expensive
and
upper
middle-class
neighborhood.
and
then
--
and
then
after
1960,
the
movement
went
forward
so
that
the
1960
census
showed
in
the
park
hill
area
there
were
only
about
500
black
citizens.
in
1966,
a
survey,
a
private
census
taken
by
one
of
the
plaintiffs'
experts
showed
that
there
were
12,000
in
the
park
hill
area,
12,000
blacks
have
moved
in.
and
by
1970,
the
time
of
trial,
the
--
the
census
--
we
didn't
have
the
census
at
that
time
but
it's
been
determined
since
it
is
in
our
brief,
was
18,500.
now,
so
we
and
the
school
board
at
this
time
with
a
school
district
which
had
neighborhood
school
sub
districts
including
all
of
the
elementary,
junior
high,
and
high
schools
set
up,
and
these
schools
in
the
park
hill
area
for
example
and
in
the
area
directly
north
of
city
park
were
established.
the
districts
--
the
boundaries
were
established
but
as
the
black
population
moved
in,
another
thing
occurred.
there
are
more
children
per
family.
the
families
were
about
25%
larger
and
in
some
instances
families
were
doubling
up
in
a
single
residential
unit,
so
there
became
a
very
tight
situation,
an
overcrowding
in
this
area.
and
that
led
to
an
area
directly
north
of
city
park
where
something
had
to
be
done
and
it
was
at
that
point
that
barrett
school
was
built,
and
it
was
planned
in
a
time
when
there
were
no
figures
as
to
exactly
what
the
population
was
by
race
or
ethnic
origin
in
this
area,
but
nevertheless,
it
went
ahead
as
judge
doyle
found
knowing
that
it
was
in
a
transition
stage
and
ultimately
it
became
--
i
think
it
opened
75
--
70%
negro
and
all
--
very
shortly,
it
was
nearly
100%
but
not
quite,
and
that
is
the
history
of
barrett.
at
the
same
time,
they
had
another
situation
over
in
west
denver,
southwest
denver
and
they
built
a
school
over
here
at
exactly
the
same
time
to
take
care
of
the
--
of
the
overcrowding
in
this
degree,
overcrowded
area,
same
size,
same
plan,
and
all.
so
--
but
nevertheless,
this
was
following
the
neighborhood
school
pattern
that
already
existed
and
yes,
there
were
new
boundaries
set
up
for
barrett
but
that
was
merely
to
cut
out
from
the
other
surrounding
schools
that
were
overcrowded
and
to
supply
a
school
here.
they
got
into
a
big
argument
in
the
district
court
as
to
why
it
did
not
extend
across
colorado
boulevard.
i
will
point
all
the
details
on
that
but
the
principle
one
being
that
--
two
things.
one,
the
traffic
as
itself
which
we
all
are
aware
of
in
setting
school
boundaries,
but
the
second
major
thing
from
our
standpoint
is
that
regardless,
the
way
the
population
actually
move
that
at
the
time
of
trial,
10
years
after
the
school
opened,
it
was
all
black
anyway.
so,
it
had
no
cause
of
relationship
building
in
that
spot
because
of
the
normal
neighborhood
progression
thereafter.
now,
so
this
was
the
park
hill
situation
over
a
period
of
10
years
and
what
the
--
what
they
tried
to
do
about
it.
at
the
same
time,
these
schools
were
becoming
crowded.
they
had
some
talk
about
mobile
units.
now,
a
mobile
unit
is
a
temporary
unit
that's
brought
in
but
it's
not
merely
a
trader,
it's
on
foundations
with
its
own
plumbing,
heating,
air
conditioning,
so
it's
not
a
second-class
facility
at
all.
the
evidence
was
that
the
board
attempted
too
that
administration
tried
to
find
out
from
the
parents
what
do
they
want.
if
they
want
a
children
bused
out
or
do
they
want
mobile
units.
and
in
one
school
for
example,
the
parents
voted
for
mobile
units,
in
other
school
they
voted
for
busing
out
and
that's
what
they
got
in
each
instance.
but
over
to
the
same
period
of
time
--
well,
we
may
have
to
go
back
and
talk
about
manual
just
for
a
moment.
mr.
william
k.
ris
yes
sir.
mr.
william
k.
ris
prior
to
the
court's
order
in
this
case,
yes.
mr.
william
k.
ris
yes
sir
it
does
and
i
can't
tell
you
just
about
exactly
what
it
is
off
the
top
of
my
head.
it's
in
the
--
it's
in
the
record
in
the
brief.
the
main
problem
being
that
by
reason
of
large
annexations
in
southwest
denver,
i
mean
in
southeast
denver
and
southwest
denver
plus
this
montbello
area
that
was
indicated,
there
were
no
money
for
new
construction
and
they
were
busing
the
children
in
to
other
schools
and
so,
there
was
a
very
substantial
number
being
bused
during
the
same
period.
now,
if
i
may
also
reply
to
one
point
that
mr.
greiner
made
that
they
were
busing
in
from
montbello
and
pass
schools
and
so
forth
they
would
be
late.
they
had
--
had
some
facilities,
some
capacities
and
that's
why
they
were
bused
over.
now,
the
whole
argument
in
the
trial
court
was
what
constituted
the
capacity.
the
plan
has
took
the
position
that
all
you
did
was
take
the
number
of
rooms
in
a
school,
multiply
it
by
30
and
that
gave
you
the
capacity
and
that
was
a
rule
of
thumb
that
the
schools
used
just
in
--
in
determining
how
much
capacity
they
had
in
general.
but
as
--
as
superintendent
(inaudible)
justified
and
he
was
the
superintendent
for
20
years,
1947
and
1967,
and
he
was
the
one
who
gave
the
basic
history
of
this
period
is
that
the
reason
they
were
busing
children
passed
on
the
minority
schools
was
because
they
were
trying
to
reduce
the
pupil
per
room
capacity
in
those
schools
and
they
had
extra
teachers,
they
had
current
professionals,
they
have
the
lower
pupil-teacher
ratio
and
with
--
by
a
reason
of
the
special
clients
in
these
minority
schools,
if
they
had
a
lower
number
of
pupils
per
room
but
instead
of
being
given
credit
for,
they
are
being
damned
forward
on
a
mathematical
basis
in
effect.
and
that
--
that
is
where
we
get
into
some
of
these
capacity
problems.
it
has
to
be
looked
at
in
the
context
in
which
these
schools
were
being
utilized
at
that
time.
mr.
william
k.
ris
no,
sir.
mr.
william
k.
ris
no
sir,
there
was
not.
the
sole
reason
for
busing
was
due
to
over
--
overcrowding
in
some
schools
and
that
--
but
in
most
instances,
in
the
large,
large
percentage
of
busing
that
was
going
on
was
because
of
no
schools
in
--
in
the
particular
areas.
they've
been
abolished
in
1967,
for
example,
which
had
gone
down
defeat.
and
although
during
the
20-year
period
of
dr.
(inaudible)
tenure,
they
spent
over
a
hundred
million
dollars
in
need
for
a
construction.
that
doesn't
mean
only
schools
with
additions
and
remodeling
and
so
forth
and
they
build
over
a
hundred
new
--
over
a
hundred
new
schools
or
addition,
these
two
schools.
nevertheless,
with
this
rapid
increase
of
doubling
of
the
school
population
in
the
20
years,
they
just
could
not
keep
up
with
it
and
then
when
they
got
whipped
on
the
bond
issue,
there
was
nothing
to
do
except
keep
busing
until
they
find
the
funds
available
for
the
new
construction.
now,
as
--
if
i
may
go
back
just
for
a
moment
to
new
manual.
manual
high
school
was
a
school
in
the
core
area.
now,
it
was
not
always
a
black
school.
at
one
time
though,
it
had
a
racial
mixture
of
anglos
and
--
and
hispanos
and
negroes
and
orientals.
there
were
small
percentages
of
orientals
in
that
particular
part
of
the
city.
the
school
was
an
old
one
and
so,
when
it
came
time
to
reconsider
what
is
to
be
done
in
the
early
‘50s,
they
decided
that
they
would
try
to
reconstruct
the
new
school
in
the
same
site
so
they
acquired
adjacent
land
and
ultimately
build
the
school
in
the
adjacent
land
and
told
--
tore
the
old
school
down
(inaudible)
mr.
william
k.
ris
well,
mr.
justice
brennan,
there's
a
reason
they
called
manual
training
high
school
because
it
originally
--
it
was
intended
to
do
--
apparently
to
give
considerable
amount
of
vocational
training.
now,
this
is
before
the
new
manual
field
and
that
was
actually
its
name
and
probably
it
had
an
aura
of
--
well
not
--
of
a
non-academic
type
of
school,
but
it
was
a
high
school
offering
all
of
the
high
school
curricular
plus
these
other
vocational
courses.
now,
when
it
came
time
to
construct
new
manual,
the
school
district
went
overboard
on
whether
it
was
going
to
do
in
trying
to
build
a
school
that
would
take
care
the
needs
of
the
pupils
in
that
area
and
that
is
--
that
is
one
of
the
arguments
that
is
made
in
the
plaintiff's
brief
that
the
school
district
hasn't
done,
but
here
they
were
doing
it
and
trying
to
do
exactly
that,
to
find
out
what
particular
needs
of
these
pupils
were
or
these
children
needed
over
the
long
haul
for
their
own
benefit
in
considering
their
own
circumstances.
and
it
is
true
that
it's
a
low
socioeconomic
area
and
not
too
many
of
the
children
went
on
to
college
but
they
needed
special
attention
and
this
is
what
the
administration
was
trying
to
do.
mr.
william
k.
ris
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
william
k.
ris
yes
sir.
throughout
the
city.
this
is
true
in
every
way,
not
merely
in
--
in
the
core
city
area,
but
no
matter
where
you
go.
mr.
william
k.
ris
well,
there
were
originally
five,
north,
east,
south,
west,
and
manual.
and
now,
there
are
eight
--
nine
--
nine.
mr.
william
k.
ris
well,
non-anglo,
yes
sir,
and
at
the
time
that
manual
was
in
the
planning
state,
so
they
could
determine
how
big
to
make
it
and
what
kind
of
facilities
to
provide
or
to
provide
shops
or
what
type
of
shops
and
so
forth,
they
had
it
on
a
brochure.
they
sought
suggestions
of
the
--
of
the
community,
had
many
meetings
and
it
was
a
wide
open
discussion
with
the
administration
and
the
board
as
to
what
they
were
going
to
do.
and
as
a
result
of
this,
they
finally
decided
on
the
new
school
and
what
it
was
to
offer.
and
as
i
say,
they
opened
in
the
same
location.
the
old
school
was
closed
and
the
new
school
opened
in
the
same
location,
same
boundaries.
and
when
it
opened
as
the
evidence
shows,
it
had
41%
anglo,
28%
black,
24%
hispano,
and
8%
oriental,
which
is
just
a
good
solid
racial
mix.
and
so,
it
was
not
99%
black.
it
wasn't
99%
hispano
i
think
in
sort.
so
that
--
that
was
a
basis
of
--
mr.
william
k.
ris
at
that
time,
yes
sir.
mr.
william
k.
ris
basically,
yes
sir
--
mr.
william
k.
ris
well,
in
the
mainland,
will
there
be
more
than
one,
actually.
there'd
be
george
washington
high
school,
george
washington
and
abraham
lincoln
in
the
southeast
--
in
the
southeast
and
george
washington
here
and
then
thomas
jefferson
clear
down
here.
now,
economically,
they
no
medium
incomes
are
in
the
core
city
in
the
hispano
area,
there's
no
question
about
it.
the
higher
incomes
--
mr.
william
k.
ris
--
are
in
the
south
and
southeast,
jefferson
and
--
there
are
more
children
who
go
to
college
for
example
from
those
schools.
there's
no
question
about
it.
mr.
william
k.
ris
yes,
sir.
mr.
william
k.
ris
additionally,
there
was
not.
manual
offered
a
full
curriculum
for
college
grads.
and
then
later
on
and
before
the
trial
or
after
1964,
there
was
a
gradual
evolution
on
transfers.
first,
it
was
a
--
called
a
limited
open
enrollment
in
1966,
and
in
about
1968,
with
a
voluntary
open
enrollment
which
allowed
any
child
in
any
school
in
which
he
was
a
majority
to
transfer
to
a
minority
school
with
transportation
provided,
and
that
has
been
true
since
1968.
but
historically,
that
was
not
true.
so,
we
have
basically
done
the
--
there
are
the
constructions
made
as
the
one
board
member
testified,
two
of
them
as
a
matter
of
fact.
we
had
a
need
in
this
neighborhood,
we
built
a
school
in
the
neighborhood
and
just
followed
the
same
neighborhood
pattern
in
cutting
out
the
manual
and
did
what
seemed
the
best
thing
for
the
kids
in
their
community
and
without
modifying
the
neighborhood
school.
now,
there's
three
resolutions
identifying
a
--
you
know
and
under
that
particular
point.
as
a
result
of
the
influx
into
the
partial
area,
these
schools,
the
grade
schools
were
fast
becoming
imbalanced
play.
no
question
about
it.
and
there
were
--
so
we
had
barrett.
the
new
school
was
constructed,
stedman
and
hallett.
and
then,
those
three
added
the
smiley
junior
high.
in
no
time,
as
there
any
change
of
boundaries
at
smiley
junior
high,
even
though
it
became
black
by
reason
of
the
population
moving
in.
but
as
a
result
of
this
impact,
the
blacks
moving
into
the
park
hill
area,
there
was
a
concern
and
the
board
took
cognizance
of
it
and
as
each
will
know,
a
black
member
of
the
board,
a
very
conquering
woman
was
the
main
focus
on
this
and
as
a
result
of
various
resolutions,
they
finally
got
to
the
point
where
the
superintendent
was
asked
to
prepare
a
plan
to
attempt
to
control
the
racial
imbalance
in
park
hill,
and
that
is
where
they
began
the
three
resolutions.
of
the
various
schools,
it
provided
and
related
to
only
four
predominated
black
schools,
barrett,
stedman,
hallett,
and
smiley
junior
high.
as
a
result
of
these
schools,
there
would
be
a
change
in
boundaries
within
the
sub-districts
so
they
would
no
longer
be
completely
contiguous
around
the
school
and
they
would
be
moved
out
to
some
of
the
predominantly
anglo
schools
and
some
of
those
children
moved
in
by
similar
changes.
and
as
to
barrett
and
stedman
and
their
feeder,
smiley,
--
hallett,
they
ran
into
a
--
into
a
different
plan
and
tried
to
go
into
the
--
a
voluntary
plan
whereby
children
predicted
in
southeast
would
be
induced
to
transfer
into
hallett
voluntarily
and
hallett
children
out.
so
basically,
insofar
as
the
mandatory
movement
is
concerned,
it
applied
only
to
the
three
schools.
and
then
there
were
some
compensatory
education
features
that
tied
into
that.
mr.
william
k.
ris
yes,
sir.
and
then,
as
a
result
of
the
decision
where
a
lot
of
these
resolutions
were
adapted
during
the
spring
of
the
year,
january
to
april
roughly.
there
was
a
school
board
election
in
may,
the
new
members
took
office
in
june.
so,
instead
of
a
four
or
three
majority
one-way
mandatory
busing
of
these
children
out
from
these
three
schools,
there
was
a
four
or
three
the
other
way
and
they
resented
the
resolution
as
to
the
mandatory
busing
out
substituted
a
voluntary
plan
to
correct
this
imbalance
or
attempt
to
correct
it
and
retained
the
other
features
of
the
plan.
and
as
the
superintendent
testified,
this
is
merely
beginning.
this
is
the
very
--
the
first
step
in
the
test
to
see
if
we
--
what
we
could
do
on
this
imbalance
in
the
area.
and
also,
secondly
and
this
is
important,
to
see
whether
busing
out
and
--
of
the
changing
schools
would
affect
the
achievement
of
these
pupils
as
he
said
he
was
not
convinced
in
the
state
of
the
social
science
education
or
social
science.
nobody
had
any
empirical
evidence
to
say
whether
it
would
or
would
not.
and
so,
this
was
his
first
attempt
to
try
to
see
what
could
be
done
in
this
regard
and
so,
it
was
not
a
--
an
absolute
thing.
it
was
merely
one
step
into
developing
educational
program
which
he
had
recommended
the
board.
and
when
it
was
--
when
they
took
the
mandatory
part
out
of
it
and
substituted
busing,
they
didn't
changed
anything
except
that
one
phase
of
it.
and
also,
what
is
the
most
important
is
if
not
a
child
had
been
bused
to
this
point,
nobody
have
been
moved
out
so
they
are
being
moved
back,
and
there
was
no
--
there
is
nothing
that
had
been
done
except
some
preliminary
planing
to
implement
the
superintendent's
recommendations
before
the
decision
was
made.
so,
it's
not
the
type
of
situation
whereby
children
that
were
in
one
school
and
being
moved
back
into
a
minority
school
and
by
the
reason
of
their
race.
as
to
the
teacher
training
or
as
to
the
inputs
and
outputs,
that
may
come
in
on
that
brief.
mr.
william
k.
ris
yes,
sir.
before
i
get
out
of
that,
i
--
i
jumped
a
little
too
fast
here.
insofar
as
the
entire
school
system
is
concerned,
judge
doyle,
the
district
judge
made
one
finding
that
just
stands
out,
head
and
shoulders,
above
everything
else
in
--
in
the
record.
and
he
stated,
“it
is
to
be
emphasized
here
that
the
board
has
not
refused
to
admit
any
student
at
any
time
because
of
racial
or
ethnic
origin,”
and
this
remark
was
being
made
as
to
the
entire
district.
mr.
william
k.
ris
i'm
just
reading
from
my
notes,
your
honor
but
-
mr.
william
k.
ris
all
right.
in
page
67
(a)
of
the
appendix,
that
page
(inaudible)
he
goes
on
and
says,
“it
should
be
emphasized
here,
the
board
does
not
refuse
to
admit
any
student
at
any
time
because
of
racial
or
ethnic
origin
since
it
requires
everyone
to
go
to
his
neighborhood
school
unless
it
is
necessary
to
busing
(inaudible)”
and
that
was
a
basic
fact
finding
insofar
as
de
jure
segregation
is
concerned
and
the
allegations
have
been
made.
this
court
found
that
insofar
as
the
traditional
classic
title
of
the
de
jure
segregation,
dual
system
that
it
just
did
not
apply
to
the
denver
area.
now,
the
court
also
referred
to
a
couple
of
small
boundary
changes
in
the
smith
and
hallett,
black-white,
(inaudible)
for
example
in
1962
and
1964
in
which
he
merely
referred
to
those
as
being
some
evidence
of
intent
going
to
the
rescission
of
the
three
resolutions
in
1969.
when
it
came
to
the
court
of
appeals,
the
court
of
appeals
never
ruled
out
the
decision
as
being
a
violation
or
non-
violation.
the
court
of
appeals
merely
said.
“well,
barrett
knew
where
it
was
and
the
boundary
changes
in
the
other
two
schools
constitute
a
executory
act.”
again,
getting
back
to
the
basics
as
to
what
constitutes
a
constitutional
violation,
there
has
to
be
a
state
act
and
it
has
to
be
cause
and
relationship.
but
the
whole
history
of
this
after
1962
and
1964
was
in
this
whole
area.
it
became
so
concentrated
with
blacks
that
there's
actually
no
cause
in
relationship
in
the
record
and
can't
be
under
the
--
under
the
facts
and
figures
as
to
that
particular
area.
mr.
william
k.
ris
yes
sir.
mr.
william
k.
ris
i'm
sorry,
i
didn't
follow
you
in
the
last
part
here.
mr.
william
k.
ris
right.
mr.
william
k.
ris
they
said,
“well,
we
find
that
there
was
already
a
violation
by
raising
boundary
changes
and
that
is
in
the
construction
there
but
they
neglected.
mr.
william
k.
ris
yes,
indeed.
mr.
william
k.
ris
--
and
i
apologize
for
it.(voice
overlap)
mr.
william
k.
ris
yes
sir.
they
used
the
same
remedy
but
never
actually
ruled
on
the
rescission
itself
as
being
a
constitutional
violation.
throughout
the
--
throughout
the
whole
discussion
on
this
when
we're
talking
about
manual,
talking
about
the
legal
boundary
issues
and
so
forth,
our
principal
complaint
about
the
court's
findings
and
the
plaintiff's
position
is
that
the
cause
and
relationship
is
still
absent
in
the
evidence
and
therefore,
the
first
cause
as
being
pointed
out,
there
were
insufficient
evidence
to
find
the
constitutional
violation
there.
now,
as
to
the
second
cause,
we
get
into
the
neighborhood
school
situation
and
he
called
it
educational
opportunity.
now,
counsel
says
they're
relying
solely
on
plessy
here.
so
i
think
that
they're
worried
on
that.
what
is
-
he
called
it
equal
education.
i'm
not
prepared
to
answer,
that
is
to
give
the
definition
of
it.
what
is
equal
justice?
a
person
is
entitled
to
a
counsel
in
a
court
if
he's
in
charged
with
a
crime.
as
this
court
has
ruled,
the
appeals
and
has
not
funds,
this
entire
transcript.
so,
and
so
far
as
providing
resources
are
concerned,
that
is
something
the
courts
have
taken
cognizance
of.
insofar
as
guaranteeing
results,
that
is
something
else
again
and
when
we're
talking
about
-
he
called
it
educational
opportunity.
too
often
those
two
things
are
confused
and
what
--
if
plessy
is
what
they're
relying
on,
in
a
typical
plessy
situation
and
have
unequal
allocation
of
buildings
and
equipment,
of
the
supplies,
of
transportation,
of
teachers,
and
so
forth.
now,
what
are
the
findings
here?
at
the
trial,
there
is
a
great
attempt
to
show
that
the
buildings
were
inadequate
in
the
--
in
the
core
city
schools.
there's
a
small
ridge,
only
added
1.3
as
compared
to
1.1,
that's
not
the
exact
figure
but
that's
comparable
to
it.
the
court
--
the
trial
court
found
that
in
the
-
in
favor
of
the
defendants
at
a
particular
issue
on
the
buildings.
and
the
court
held
that
by
reason
of
the
evidence
that
--
that
there
were
new
additions
to
the
older
buildings
that
they
were
remodeled
and
they
had
adequate
modern
lighting,
modern
ceiling
and
so
forth,
that
there
was
no
unreasonable
allocation
there.
there
is
no
evidence
of
any
inadequacy
in
any
of
the
equipment
or
in
any
of
the
supplies.
there
is
no
discrimination
in
transportation
of
the
people
who
had
to
be
transported,
they're
all
transported
in
the
same
buses.
there
is
no
discrimination
in
the
extra-curricular
activities
and
sports
program.
insofar
as
allocation
and
moneys
were
concerned,
the
only
evidence
was
that
these
schools
were
allocated
a
greater
amount
than
the
other
schools.
this
included,
not
federal
funds
and
state
funds,
but
they
did
have
a
greater
allocation
of
money.
mr.
william
k.
ris
yes
sir.
the
school
with
the
lower
--
or
with
the
lowest
achievement
results.
so
that
basically,
the
only
thing
that
the
court
draft
or
came
up
with
at
all
was
a
matter
of
teachers,
teacher
experience.
now,
every
teacher
in
colorado
has
to
be
a
college
graduate,
have
a
degree,
being
licensed
by
the
state.
and
even
the
trial
court
did
not
find
that
there
was
such
a
disparity
here
between
the
teachers'
comment
about
it
as
an
addition
is
what
the
trial
court
used
all
the
way
through,
various
rendition
of
inferiority.
some
of
which
were
resources
that
are
complained
of
by
the
plaintiffs
and
others
were
the
achievement
results,
for
example,
the
dropout.
it
has
to
be
kept
in
my
mind
that
some
of
the
causes
potentially
and
some
effects,
but
the
teachers
were
the
only
thing
that
the
district
court
even
alluded
to.
there
is
an
issue
of
inferiority
(inaudible)
and
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
that
was
not
such
a
substantial
factor
as
to
constitute
an
unequal
resource
being
furnished.
and
even
the
evidence
itself
did
not
support
that.
dr.
coleman,
for
example,
stated
that
the
experience
of
teachers
is
far
overrated.
some
of
the
--
mr.
william
k.
ris
he
was
the
plaintiff's
witness
your
honor.
mr.
william
k.
ris
yes
sir.
mr.
william
k.
ris
i'm
trying
to
--
i'm
trying
to
think
of
what
--
of
what
exhibit
might
be
available
to
disclose
that
then
in
the
(inaudible)
i
--
i
don't
believe
there
is
on
a
per
people
or
even
on
a
per
school
basis
if
it
was
a
general
testimony,
and
i'm
not
sure
they
have
any
statistics
in
the
record
yet.
mr.
william
k.
ris
on
that?
no,
sir.
but
there's
not
a
specific
findings
in
the
contrary
that
was
the
sole
evidence.
mr.
william
k.
ris
he
found
inferiority
--
mr.
william
k.
ris
in
totality,
but
the
only
--
the
only
thing
that
he
referred
to
specifically,
insofar
as
allocated
resources
was
the
younger
teachers,
plus
inexperienced
teachers.
beyond
that,
there
was
talk
about
dropout
rates,
lower
achievement
scores
and
so
forth.
on
the
achievement
scores,
of
course,
as
the
attorney
general's
brief
points
out,
he
took
the
achievement's
course.
he
took
the
fact
of
arrangement
balance
and
put
the
two
together
but
without
any
evidence,
without
any
finding
really
of
cause
relationship.
mr.
william
k.
ris
they
were
--
mr.
william
k.
ris
but
he
found
expressly
the
--
mr.
brown
that
it
was
not
the
substantial
factor
and
not
a
really
material
fact.
he
request
the
--
i
i
kept
the
moment
to
point
out
exactly
where
this
is
to
find.
mr.
william
k.
ris
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
william
k.
ris
he
expressed
the
client
that
it
was
not
a
potential
contributory
factor
into
inferiority.
mr.
william
k.
ris
i
think
that
is
correct.
and
i
think
which
one
it
was
that
that's
going
again
at
co-counsel.
insofar
as
the
other
factors
on
relationship,
the
plaintiffs
relied
on
various
experts,
dr.
dan
dodson
who
was
the
only
expert
to
testify
to
hearing
the
merits
than
on
the
hearing
of
the
remedies,
dr.
coleman,
dr.
o'reilly,
and
these
were
called
in
and
dr.
sullivan.
all
of
whom
had
no
knowledge
whatsoever
of
the
denver
situation.
they
never
studied
denver
situation.
they
had
no
statistics
on
denver.
they
were
talking
merely
as
educators
or
sociologist
or
psychologist
from
other
parts
of
the
country.
one
originally
from
berkley,
down
in
massachusetts,
and
other
psychologists
from
the
new
york
state
board
education
and
of
course,
they
had
dr.
coleman.
but
again,
insofar
as
finding
a
causation
between
racial
imbalance
and
educational
achievement,
the
record
insofar
as
any
virtual
evidence
concerned
is
as
completely
signed.
dr.
coleman
was
with
of
the
opinion
that
it
was
a
basically
a
culture
deprivation
in
the
lower
socio-economic
family
groups
and
neighborhoods.
and
that
only
to
the
extent
that
minorities
were
found
in
those
particular
areas.
was
there
any
relationship
at
all?
but
he
was
looking
solely
of
the
family
background
and
the
cultural
background
of
these
children.
and
dr.
dodson
went
on
agreeing
things
about
various
attitudes
in
this
community
and
of
teachers
and
pupils
and
parents
and
so
forth,
not
with
any
relationship
to
the
denver
situation
but
just
generally
as
a
--
as
a
sociologist
might
do,
and
again,
a
complete
lack
of
cause
relationship.
dr.
o'reilly,
who
is
called
in
rebuttal
by
the
plaintiffs
and
the
remedy
hearing
pointed
out
that
this
whole
manner
of
educational
equalities,
the
very
unsettled
appeal,
said
many
years
of
experimentation
would
be
necessary
to
slowly
and
carefully
identify
and
develop
the
program
to
try
to
eliminate
it.
it's
an
educational
process.
so
as
far
as
the
quarter
of
schools,
we
have
a
finding
by
the
court,
the
trial
court,
which
not
attacked
here
that
if
it
is
not
a
brown
situation,
no
brown
constitutional
violation
by
reason
of
the
evidence
concerning
the
so-called
inputs
or
the
allocation
of
resources
except
for
the
teachers
and
even
the
court
of
appeals
so
that
there
was
no
plus
evaluations.
so
that
what
do
we
end
up
with?
we
end
up
with
an
educational
problem
that
the
educators
have
no
answer
for.
the
state
of
the
science
has
not
such
that
a
district
court
can
decree
you
shall
do
this,
that
and
the
other
thing,
but
it
is
something
that
dr.
o'reilly
said,
as
dr.
gilberts,
the
superintendent
of
the
schools
who
was
the
principal
expert
of
defense
says,
“as
we
worked
out
over
a
period
of
time.”
and
we
suggest
to
the
court
that
this
is
something
that
is
being
done
and
has
to
be
done
but
it
is
not
a
constitutional
violation
to
remedied.
it's
an
educational
problem
which
has
to
be
handled
at
a
local
level
and
it's
something
that
is
beyond
the
confidence
of
the
federal
judiciary.
the
educators
served
with
all
their
know-how
or
having
a
harder
time
and
certainly,
it's
not
something
that
can
be
decreed
in
such
as
furnishing
counsel,
furnishing
transcript,
furnishing
people's
facilities
of
physical
nature.
and
so,
basically,
on
one
hand,
we
say
that
there's
no
constitutional
violation
and
therefore,
there
is
no
remedy
and
even
if
there
were
constitutional
violation,
we
have
to
compensate
the
courts.
thank
you.
mr.
william
k.
ris
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i've
listened
with
interest
with
respect
to
some
of
the
facts
that's
been
related
to
the
court
and
would
direct
the
court's
attention
to
basic
fallacy
that
some
of
the
facts
related
extend
many
years
back
prior
to
the
trial
of
this
case
or
the
conditions
as
existed
as
of
the
time
of
the
trial.
both
mr.
nabrit
and
mr.
greiner
have
related
facts
that
should
indicate
on
the
phase
that
we
have
a
static
situation
and
had
a
static
situation
for
a
considerable
period
of
time
when
that
is
not
the
case
whatsoever
with
respect
to
the
denver
--
denver
background.
and
this
assess
the
going
into
some
additional
facts
and
figures
with
respect
to
denver
itself
and
the
school
district,
denver
is
a
home
rule
city
under
the
colorado
constitution.
it
has
the
basic
area.
there
are
many
suburbs
around
it,
but
denver
itself,
at
the
time
of
trial,
consisted
of
an
area
of
about
a
hundred
square
miles
that
had
increased
roughly
40%
after
world
war
ii
by
reason
of
annexations
to
the
city
from
the
surrounding
area.
another
colorado
constitution,
the
school
district
for
the
city
and
county
of
denver
has
exactly
the
same
boundaries
as
the
city
and
county
itself.
and
until
very
recently,
the
school
board
had
absolutely
no
say
so
as
to
what
areas
would
be
brought
into
the
school
district,
yet
the
city
and
country
of
denver
wanted
to
annex
it
came
whether
the
school
district
want
to
do
it
or
not.
very
recently,
that
has
been
changed
but
the
change
is
so
recent
as
not
to
be
contributory.
the
school
board
itself
had
indicated
is
an
elective
body,
seven
members
has
been
for
some
period
of
time.
the
general
area
of
denver
with
the
recent
annexation
shown
on
this
exhibit,
there
are
--
as
indicated
on
the
other
exhibit,
this
was
a
so-called
core
city
area.
the
business
district
being
downtown
and
the
so-called
five
points
area
being
to
the
north
and
east
of
that
area
of
the
downtown
area.
prior
to
world
war
ii,
it
is
true
that
the
black
population
was
well-concentrated
in
the
five
points
area.
after
world
war
ii,
a
completely
different
situation
existed
and
expanded,
and
this
requires
again
some
population
figures.
in
1940,
the
population
in
denver
was
322,000.
in
1970,
at
the
time
of
trial,
it
was
515,000
or
an
increased
of
40%.
now,
in
comparison
to
this
increase
of
40%,
the
black
population
in
1940
was
7,300.
it
increased,
it
just
doubled
in
the
10
years
between
1940
and
1950
and
the
great
bulk
of
this
increase
was
after
world
war
ii.
so
that
is
1950
census.
the
black
population
was
15,000
an
increased
of
100%.
the
next
10
years
--
mr.
william
k.
ris
the
--
no,
sir.
the
--
mr.
william
k.
ris
the
school
population
went
up
during
the
same
period,
justice
potter,
because
of
the
--
basically,
increase
in
--
in
babes
--
post-war
babies
which
we
are
all
familiar.
so
the
--
the
school
population
between
1940
and
1970
are
just
about
double.
whereas
the
--
the
city
population
at
only
40%.
mr.
william
k.
ris
yes
sir.
so,
it
made
little
of
a
difference.
and
the
black
population
itself
doubled
again
between
1950
and
1960,
another
15,000
or
15,000
to
30,000
and
another
17,000
between
1960
and
1970.
so
that
the
--
between
1940
and
1970,
when
the
city
population
was
increasing
40%,
the
black
population
increased
over
600%.
the
hispano
population,
we
do
not
have
comparable
figures,
because
the
1940
census
and
the
1950
census
did
not
separately
count
and
tabulate
--
you
know,
the
hispanos
as
a
group.
they
were
merely
listed
under
anglo,
so,
all
we
have
insofar
as
census
figures
are
concerned,
in
1960,
there
were
60,000
in
the
city,
in
1970,
86,000.
so,
numerically,
they
were
greater
than
the
blacks
but
not
increasing
in
the
--
in
the
same
proportions
as
in
the
progression.
mr.
william
k.
ris
well,
hispanic
surname,
that
probably
is
--
is
the
best
way
of
identification
and
i
think
that's
--
mr.
william
k.
ris
insofar
--
insofar
as
the
--
as
the
school
district
figures
are
concerned,
in
this
case,
they
were
identified
in
this
one
fashion.
shortly
after
school
opened
in
the
fall,
a
call
--
a
call
would
go
out
to
the
principals
to
report
back,
anglos,
negros,
hispanos,
and
orientals.
the
principal
would
ask
the
teachers,
“just
give
me
a--
a
count
of
what
you
think
is
in
your
room,”
and
then
that
would
be
assembled
by
schools
and
have
that
transmitted
in.
so
it's
a
--
it's
a
rather
nebulous
type
of
thing
because
we
have
hispanos,
obviously,
are
ethnic
who
have
names
smith
or
brown
and
we
also
have
non-hispanos
with
--
mr.
william
k.
ris
right,
exactly.
so
it's
--
it's
rough
but
the
school
district
during
the
years
had
to
--
did
keep
this,
this
type
of
census,
had
followed
the
same
pattern.
now,
so
far
as
the
u.s.
census,
i
cannot
answer,
i
just
don't
know.
as
a
result
of
this
influx
and
this
is
where
we
get
into
--
into
a
very
flexible
type
of
situation.
this
is
city
park,
the
square.
it's
about
a
mile
square.
manual
high
is
right
here,
cole
junior
high
just
to
the
north
of
manual.
now,
this
was
the
so-called
five
points
area
until
after
world
war
ii,
the
--
the
black
population
was
quite
well
restricted.
there
were
some
exceptions,
of
course.
the
large
number
of
people
coming
in
and
also
i
think
that
there
is
one
thing
that
--
that
had
a
great
influence
on
this
and
that
was
the
colorado
supreme
court
decision
which
explains
that
in
1957
that
private
racial
covenants
and
deeds
were
void
and
not
enforceable
even
went
through
in
this
court
as
in
--
in
holding
and
an
answer
of
the
court
at
that
time.
so,
beginning
in
--
in
the
late
1940s
when
the
population
influx
began,
york
street,
which
is
just
on
the
east
edge
of
--
of
city
park,
as
of
1950,
and
--
and
then
this
is
again
roughly,
but
it's
best
if
we
can
depict
it,
became
the
easterly
boundary
for
the
black
population.
between
1950
and
1960,
it
extended
along
from
west
to
east
and
again
to
the
north
of
city
park,
so
that
what
previously
was
a
--
a
basically
white
residential
area
became
the
reverse.
and
in
that
particular
area,
for
example,
in
1940,
there
were
only
86
black
citizens
in
that
particular
area.
in
1950,
it
was
898,
but
it
jumped
in
the
next
10
years
to
1960
to
8,700
between
just
to
the
north
of
the
park
and
in
1970,
the
time
of
trial,
it
was
up
to
10,500.
so
that
by
1960,
the
--
the
population
that
--
the
black
population
had
generally
moved
in
and
acquired
substantial
property
in
this
area.
now,
we
come
into
the
park
hill
area
where
you
get
to
the
east
and
extends
from
colorado
boulevard
which
is
the
main
north-south
thoroughfare,
six-lane
main
highway
and
extends
on
up
to
the
airport.
those
of
you
who've
been
to
the
airport,
as
you
come
in,
you
come
right
down
32nd
avenue
parkway
right
through
that
area.
it
was
a
--
a
typical
middle-class,
white
neighborhood,
single-family
dwellings
except
for
monaco
parkway
which
is
more
expensive
and
upper
middle-class
neighborhood.
and
then
--
and
then
after
1960,
the
movement
went
forward
so
that
the
1960
census
showed
in
the
park
hill
area
there
were
only
about
500
black
citizens.
in
1966,
a
survey,
a
private
census
taken
by
one
of
the
plaintiffs'
experts
showed
that
there
were
12,000
in
the
park
hill
area,
12,000
blacks
have
moved
in.
and
by
1970,
the
time
of
trial,
the
--
the
census
--
we
didn't
have
the
census
at
that
time
but
it's
been
determined
since
it
is
in
our
brief,
was
18,500.
now,
so
we
and
the
school
board
at
this
time
with
a
school
district
which
had
neighborhood
school
sub
districts
including
all
of
the
elementary,
junior
high,
and
high
schools
set
up,
and
these
schools
in
the
park
hill
area
for
example
and
in
the
area
directly
north
of
city
park
were
established.
the
districts
--
the
boundaries
were
established
but
as
the
black
population
moved
in,
another
thing
occurred.
there
are
more
children
per
family.
the
families
were
about
25%
larger
and
in
some
instances
families
were
doubling
up
in
a
single
residential
unit,
so
there
became
a
very
tight
situation,
an
overcrowding
in
this
area.
and
that
led
to
an
area
directly
north
of
city
park
where
something
had
to
be
done
and
it
was
at
that
point
that
barrett
school
was
built,
and
it
was
planned
in
a
time
when
there
were
no
figures
as
to
exactly
what
the
population
was
by
race
or
ethnic
origin
in
this
area,
but
nevertheless,
it
went
ahead
as
judge
doyle
found
knowing
that
it
was
in
a
transition
stage
and
ultimately
it
became
--
i
think
it
opened
75
--
70%
negro
and
all
--
very
shortly,
it
was
nearly
100%
but
not
quite,
and
that
is
the
history
of
barrett.
at
the
same
time,
they
had
another
situation
over
in
west
denver,
southwest
denver
and
they
built
a
school
over
here
at
exactly
the
same
time
to
take
care
of
the
--
of
the
overcrowding
in
this
degree,
overcrowded
area,
same
size,
same
plan,
and
all.
so
--
but
nevertheless,
this
was
following
the
neighborhood
school
pattern
that
already
existed
and
yes,
there
were
new
boundaries
set
up
for
barrett
but
that
was
merely
to
cut
out
from
the
other
surrounding
schools
that
were
overcrowded
and
to
supply
a
school
here.
they
got
into
a
big
argument
in
the
district
court
as
to
why
it
did
not
extend
across
colorado
boulevard.
i
will
point
all
the
details
on
that
but
the
principle
one
being
that
--
two
things.
one,
the
traffic
as
itself
which
we
all
are
aware
of
in
setting
school
boundaries,
but
the
second
major
thing
from
our
standpoint
is
that
regardless,
the
way
the
population
actually
move
that
at
the
time
of
trial,
10
years
after
the
school
opened,
it
was
all
black
anyway.
so,
it
had
no
cause
of
relationship
building
in
that
spot
because
of
the
normal
neighborhood
progression
thereafter.
now,
so
this
was
the
park
hill
situation
over
a
period
of
10
years
and
what
the
--
what
they
tried
to
do
about
it.
at
the
same
time,
these
schools
were
becoming
crowded.
they
had
some
talk
about
mobile
units.
now,
a
mobile
unit
is
a
temporary
unit
that's
brought
in
but
it's
not
merely
a
trader,
it's
on
foundations
with
its
own
plumbing,
heating,
air
conditioning,
so
it's
not
a
second-class
facility
at
all.
the
evidence
was
that
the
board
attempted
too
that
administration
tried
to
find
out
from
the
parents
what
do
they
want.
if
they
want
a
children
bused
out
or
do
they
want
mobile
units.
and
in
one
school
for
example,
the
parents
voted
for
mobile
units,
in
other
school
they
voted
for
busing
out
and
that's
what
they
got
in
each
instance.
but
over
to
the
same
period
of
time
--
well,
we
may
have
to
go
back
and
talk
about
manual
just
for
a
moment.
mr.
william
k.
ris
yes
sir.
mr.
william
k.
ris
prior
to
the
court's
order
in
this
case,
yes.
mr.
william
k.
ris
yes
sir
it
does
and
i
can't
tell
you
just
about
exactly
what
it
is
off
the
top
of
my
head.
it's
in
the
--
it's
in
the
record
in
the
brief.
the
main
problem
being
that
by
reason
of
large
annexations
in
southwest
denver,
i
mean
in
southeast
denver
and
southwest
denver
plus
this
montbello
area
that
was
indicated,
there
were
no
money
for
new
construction
and
they
were
busing
the
children
in
to
other
schools
and
so,
there
was
a
very
substantial
number
being
bused
during
the
same
period.
now,
if
i
may
also
reply
to
one
point
that
mr.
greiner
made
that
they
were
busing
in
from
montbello
and
pass
schools
and
so
forth
they
would
be
late.
they
had
--
had
some
facilities,
some
capacities
and
that's
why
they
were
bused
over.
now,
the
whole
argument
in
the
trial
court
was
what
constituted
the
capacity.
the
plan
has
took
the
position
that
all
you
did
was
take
the
number
of
rooms
in
a
school,
multiply
it
by
30
and
that
gave
you
the
capacity
and
that
was
a
rule
of
thumb
that
the
schools
used
just
in
--
in
determining
how
much
capacity
they
had
in
general.
but
as
--
as
superintendent
(inaudible)
justified
and
he
was
the
superintendent
for
20
years,
1947
and
1967,
and
he
was
the
one
who
gave
the
basic
history
of
this
period
is
that
the
reason
they
were
busing
children
passed
on
the
minority
schools
was
because
they
were
trying
to
reduce
the
pupil
per
room
capacity
in
those
schools
and
they
had
extra
teachers,
they
had
current
professionals,
they
have
the
lower
pupil-teacher
ratio
and
with
--
by
a
reason
of
the
special
clients
in
these
minority
schools,
if
they
had
a
lower
number
of
pupils
per
room
but
instead
of
being
given
credit
for,
they
are
being
damned
forward
on
a
mathematical
basis
in
effect.
and
that
--
that
is
where
we
get
into
some
of
these
capacity
problems.
it
has
to
be
looked
at
in
the
context
in
which
these
schools
were
being
utilized
at
that
time.
mr.
william
k.
ris
no,
sir.
mr.
william
k.
ris
no
sir,
there
was
not.
the
sole
reason
for
busing
was
due
to
over
--
overcrowding
in
some
schools
and
that
--
but
in
most
instances,
in
the
large,
large
percentage
of
busing
that
was
going
on
was
because
of
no
schools
in
--
in
the
particular
areas.
they've
been
abolished
in
1967,
for
example,
which
had
gone
down
defeat.
and
although
during
the
20-year
period
of
dr.
(inaudible)
tenure,
they
spent
over
a
hundred
million
dollars
in
need
for
a
construction.
that
doesn't
mean
only
schools
with
additions
and
remodeling
and
so
forth
and
they
build
over
a
hundred
new
--
over
a
hundred
new
schools
or
addition,
these
two
schools.
nevertheless,
with
this
rapid
increase
of
doubling
of
the
school
population
in
the
20
years,
they
just
could
not
keep
up
with
it
and
then
when
they
got
whipped
on
the
bond
issue,
there
was
nothing
to
do
except
keep
busing
until
they
find
the
funds
available
for
the
new
construction.
now,
as
--
if
i
may
go
back
just
for
a
moment
to
new
manual.
manual
high
school
was
a
school
in
the
core
area.
now,
it
was
not
always
a
black
school.
at
one
time
though,
it
had
a
racial
mixture
of
anglos
and
--
and
hispanos
and
negroes
and
orientals.
there
were
small
percentages
of
orientals
in
that
particular
part
of
the
city.
the
school
was
an
old
one
and
so,
when
it
came
time
to
reconsider
what
is
to
be
done
in
the
early
‘50s,
they
decided
that
they
would
try
to
reconstruct
the
new
school
in
the
same
site
so
they
acquired
adjacent
land
and
ultimately
build
the
school
in
the
adjacent
land
and
told
--
tore
the
old
school
down
(inaudible)
mr.
william
k.
ris
well,
mr.
justice
brennan,
there's
a
reason
they
called
manual
training
high
school
because
it
originally
--
it
was
intended
to
do
--
apparently
to
give
considerable
amount
of
vocational
training.
now,
this
is
before
the
new
manual
field
and
that
was
actually
its
name
and
probably
it
had
an
aura
of
--
well
not
--
of
a
non-academic
type
of
school,
but
it
was
a
high
school
offering
all
of
the
high
school
curricular
plus
these
other
vocational
courses.
now,
when
it
came
time
to
construct
new
manual,
the
school
district
went
overboard
on
whether
it
was
going
to
do
in
trying
to
build
a
school
that
would
take
care
the
needs
of
the
pupils
in
that
area
and
that
is
--
that
is
one
of
the
arguments
that
is
made
in
the
plaintiff's
brief
that
the
school
district
hasn't
done,
but
here
they
were
doing
it
and
trying
to
do
exactly
that,
to
find
out
what
particular
needs
of
these
pupils
were
or
these
children
needed
over
the
long
haul
for
their
own
benefit
in
considering
their
own
circumstances.
and
it
is
true
that
it's
a
low
socioeconomic
area
and
not
too
many
of
the
children
went
on
to
college
but
they
needed
special
attention
and
this
is
what
the
administration
was
trying
to
do.
mr.
william
k.
ris
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
william
k.
ris
yes
sir.
throughout
the
city.
this
is
true
in
every
way,
not
merely
in
--
in
the
core
city
area,
but
no
matter
where
you
go.
mr.
william
k.
ris
well,
there
were
originally
five,
north,
east,
south,
west,
and
manual.
and
now,
there
are
eight
--
nine
--
nine.
mr.
william
k.
ris
well,
non-anglo,
yes
sir,
and
at
the
time
that
manual
was
in
the
planning
state,
so
they
could
determine
how
big
to
make
it
and
what
kind
of
facilities
to
provide
or
to
provide
shops
or
what
type
of
shops
and
so
forth,
they
had
it
on
a
brochure.
they
sought
suggestions
of
the
--
of
the
community,
had
many
meetings
and
it
was
a
wide
open
discussion
with
the
administration
and
the
board
as
to
what
they
were
going
to
do.
and
as
a
result
of
this,
they
finally
decided
on
the
new
school
and
what
it
was
to
offer.
and
as
i
say,
they
opened
in
the
same
location.
the
old
school
was
closed
and
the
new
school
opened
in
the
same
location,
same
boundaries.
and
when
it
opened
as
the
evidence
shows,
it
had
41%
anglo,
28%
black,
24%
hispano,
and
8%
oriental,
which
is
just
a
good
solid
racial
mix.
and
so,
it
was
not
99%
black.
it
wasn't
99%
hispano
i
think
in
sort.
so
that
--
that
was
a
basis
of
--
mr.
william
k.
ris
at
that
time,
yes
sir.
mr.
william
k.
ris
basically,
yes
sir
--
mr.
william
k.
ris
well,
in
the
mainland,
will
there
be
more
than
one,
actually.
there'd
be
george
washington
high
school,
george
washington
and
abraham
lincoln
in
the
southeast
--
in
the
southeast
and
george
washington
here
and
then
thomas
jefferson
clear
down
here.
now,
economically,
they
no
medium
incomes
are
in
the
core
city
in
the
hispano
area,
there's
no
question
about
it.
the
higher
incomes
--
mr.
william
k.
ris
--
are
in
the
south
and
southeast,
jefferson
and
--
there
are
more
children
who
go
to
college
for
example
from
those
schools.
there's
no
question
about
it.
mr.
william
k.
ris
yes,
sir.
mr.
william
k.
ris
additionally,
there
was
not.
manual
offered
a
full
curriculum
for
college
grads.
and
then
later
on
and
before
the
trial
or
after
1964,
there
was
a
gradual
evolution
on
transfers.
first,
it
was
a
--
called
a
limited
open
enrollment
in
1966,
and
in
about
1968,
with
a
voluntary
open
enrollment
which
allowed
any
child
in
any
school
in
which
he
was
a
majority
to
transfer
to
a
minority
school
with
transportation
provided,
and
that
has
been
true
since
1968.
but
historically,
that
was
not
true.
so,
we
have
basically
done
the
--
there
are
the
constructions
made
as
the
one
board
member
testified,
two
of
them
as
a
matter
of
fact.
we
had
a
need
in
this
neighborhood,
we
built
a
school
in
the
neighborhood
and
just
followed
the
same
neighborhood
pattern
in
cutting
out
the
manual
and
did
what
seemed
the
best
thing
for
the
kids
in
their
community
and
without
modifying
the
neighborhood
school.
now,
there's
three
resolutions
identifying
a
--
you
know
and
under
that
particular
point.
as
a
result
of
the
influx
into
the
partial
area,
these
schools,
the
grade
schools
were
fast
becoming
imbalanced
play.
no
question
about
it.
and
there
were
--
so
we
had
barrett.
the
new
school
was
constructed,
stedman
and
hallett.
and
then,
those
three
added
the
smiley
junior
high.
in
no
time,
as
there
any
change
of
boundaries
at
smiley
junior
high,
even
though
it
became
black
by
reason
of
the
population
moving
in.
but
as
a
result
of
this
impact,
the
blacks
moving
into
the
park
hill
area,
there
was
a
concern
and
the
board
took
cognizance
of
it
and
as
each
will
know,
a
black
member
of
the
board,
a
very
conquering
woman
was
the
main
focus
on
this
and
as
a
result
of
various
resolutions,
they
finally
got
to
the
point
where
the
superintendent
was
asked
to
prepare
a
plan
to
attempt
to
control
the
racial
imbalance
in
park
hill,
and
that
is
where
they
began
the
three
resolutions.
of
the
various
schools,
it
provided
and
related
to
only
four
predominated
black
schools,
barrett,
stedman,
hallett,
and
smiley
junior
high.
as
a
result
of
these
schools,
there
would
be
a
change
in
boundaries
within
the
sub-districts
so
they
would
no
longer
be
completely
contiguous
around
the
school
and
they
would
be
moved
out
to
some
of
the
predominantly
anglo
schools
and
some
of
those
children
moved
in
by
similar
changes.
and
as
to
barrett
and
stedman
and
their
feeder,
smiley,
--
hallett,
they
ran
into
a
--
into
a
different
plan
and
tried
to
go
into
the
--
a
voluntary
plan
whereby
children
predicted
in
southeast
would
be
induced
to
transfer
into
hallett
voluntarily
and
hallett
children
out.
so
basically,
insofar
as
the
mandatory
movement
is
concerned,
it
applied
only
to
the
three
schools.
and
then
there
were
some
compensatory
education
features
that
tied
into
that.
mr.
william
k.
ris
yes,
sir.
and
then,
as
a
result
of
the
decision
where
a
lot
of
these
resolutions
were
adapted
during
the
spring
of
the
year,
january
to
april
roughly.
there
was
a
school
board
election
in
may,
the
new
members
took
office
in
june.
so,
instead
of
a
four
or
three
majority
one-way
mandatory
busing
of
these
children
out
from
these
three
schools,
there
was
a
four
or
three
the
other
way
and
they
resented
the
resolution
as
to
the
mandatory
busing
out
substituted
a
voluntary
plan
to
correct
this
imbalance
or
attempt
to
correct
it
and
retained
the
other
features
of
the
plan.
and
as
the
superintendent
testified,
this
is
merely
beginning.
this
is
the
very
--
the
first
step
in
the
test
to
see
if
we
--
what
we
could
do
on
this
imbalance
in
the
area.
and
also,
secondly
and
this
is
important,
to
see
whether
busing
out
and
--
of
the
changing
schools
would
affect
the
achievement
of
these
pupils
as
he
said
he
was
not
convinced
in
the
state
of
the
social
science
education
or
social
science.
nobody
had
any
empirical
evidence
to
say
whether
it
would
or
would
not.
and
so,
this
was
his
first
attempt
to
try
to
see
what
could
be
done
in
this
regard
and
so,
it
was
not
a
--
an
absolute
thing.
it
was
merely
one
step
into
developing
educational
program
which
he
had
recommended
the
board.
and
when
it
was
--
when
they
took
the
mandatory
part
out
of
it
and
substituted
busing,
they
didn't
changed
anything
except
that
one
phase
of
it.
and
also,
what
is
the
most
important
is
if
not
a
child
had
been
bused
to
this
point,
nobody
have
been
moved
out
so
they
are
being
moved
back,
and
there
was
no
--
there
is
nothing
that
had
been
done
except
some
preliminary
planing
to
implement
the
superintendent's
recommendations
before
the
decision
was
made.
so,
it's
not
the
type
of
situation
whereby
children
that
were
in
one
school
and
being
moved
back
into
a
minority
school
and
by
the
reason
of
their
race.
as
to
the
teacher
training
or
as
to
the
inputs
and
outputs,
that
may
come
in
on
that
brief.
mr.
william
k.
ris
yes,
sir.
before
i
get
out
of
that,
i
--
i
jumped
a
little
too
fast
here.
insofar
as
the
entire
school
system
is
concerned,
judge
doyle,
the
district
judge
made
one
finding
that
just
stands
out,
head
and
shoulders,
above
everything
else
in
--
in
the
record.
and
he
stated,
“it
is
to
be
emphasized
here
that
the
board
has
not
refused
to
admit
any
student
at
any
time
because
of
racial
or
ethnic
origin,”
and
this
remark
was
being
made
as
to
the
entire
district.
mr.
william
k.
ris
i'm
just
reading
from
my
notes,
your
honor
but
-
mr.
william
k.
ris
all
right.
in
page
67
(a)
of
the
appendix,
that
page
(inaudible)
he
goes
on
and
says,
“it
should
be
emphasized
here,
the
board
does
not
refuse
to
admit
any
student
at
any
time
because
of
racial
or
ethnic
origin
since
it
requires
everyone
to
go
to
his
neighborhood
school
unless
it
is
necessary
to
busing
(inaudible)”
and
that
was
a
basic
fact
finding
insofar
as
de
jure
segregation
is
concerned
and
the
allegations
have
been
made.
this
court
found
that
insofar
as
the
traditional
classic
title
of
the
de
jure
segregation,
dual
system
that
it
just
did
not
apply
to
the
denver
area.
now,
the
court
also
referred
to
a
couple
of
small
boundary
changes
in
the
smith
and
hallett,
black-white,
(inaudible)
for
example
in
1962
and
1964
in
which
he
merely
referred
to
those
as
being
some
evidence
of
intent
going
to
the
rescission
of
the
three
resolutions
in
1969.
when
it
came
to
the
court
of
appeals,
the
court
of
appeals
never
ruled
out
the
decision
as
being
a
violation
or
non-
violation.
the
court
of
appeals
merely
said.
“well,
barrett
knew
where
it
was
and
the
boundary
changes
in
the
other
two
schools
constitute
a
executory
act.”
again,
getting
back
to
the
basics
as
to
what
constitutes
a
constitutional
violation,
there
has
to
be
a
state
act
and
it
has
to
be
cause
and
relationship.
but
the
whole
history
of
this
after
1962
and
1964
was
in
this
whole
area.
it
became
so
concentrated
with
blacks
that
there's
actually
no
cause
in
relationship
in
the
record
and
can't
be
under
the
--
under
the
facts
and
figures
as
to
that
particular
area.
mr.
william
k.
ris
yes
sir.
mr.
william
k.
ris
i'm
sorry,
i
didn't
follow
you
in
the
last
part
here.
mr.
william
k.
ris
right.
mr.
william
k.
ris
they
said,
“well,
we
find
that
there
was
already
a
violation
by
raising
boundary
changes
and
that
is
in
the
construction
there
but
they
neglected.
mr.
william
k.
ris
yes,
indeed.
mr.
william
k.
ris
--
and
i
apologize
for
it.(voice
overlap)
mr.
william
k.
ris
yes
sir.
they
used
the
same
remedy
but
never
actually
ruled
on
the
rescission
itself
as
being
a
constitutional
violation.
throughout
the
--
throughout
the
whole
discussion
on
this
when
we're
talking
about
manual,
talking
about
the
legal
boundary
issues
and
so
forth,
our
principal
complaint
about
the
court's
findings
and
the
plaintiff's
position
is
that
the
cause
and
relationship
is
still
absent
in
the
evidence
and
therefore,
the
first
cause
as
being
pointed
out,
there
were
insufficient
evidence
to
find
the
constitutional
violation
there.
now,
as
to
the
second
cause,
we
get
into
the
neighborhood
school
situation
and
he
called
it
educational
opportunity.
now,
counsel
says
they're
relying
solely
on
plessy
here.
so
i
think
that
they're
worried
on
that.
what
is
-
he
called
it
equal
education.
i'm
not
prepared
to
answer,
that
is
to
give
the
definition
of
it.
what
is
equal
justice?
a
person
is
entitled
to
a
counsel
in
a
court
if
he's
in
charged
with
a
crime.
as
this
court
has
ruled,
the
appeals
and
has
not
funds,
this
entire
transcript.
so,
and
so
far
as
providing
resources
are
concerned,
that
is
something
the
courts
have
taken
cognizance
of.
insofar
as
guaranteeing
results,
that
is
something
else
again
and
when
we're
talking
about
-
he
called
it
educational
opportunity.
too
often
those
two
things
are
confused
and
what
--
if
plessy
is
what
they're
relying
on,
in
a
typical
plessy
situation
and
have
unequal
allocation
of
buildings
and
equipment,
of
the
supplies,
of
transportation,
of
teachers,
and
so
forth.
now,
what
are
the
findings
here?
at
the
trial,
there
is
a
great
attempt
to
show
that
the
buildings
were
inadequate
in
the
--
in
the
core
city
schools.
there's
a
small
ridge,
only
added
1.3
as
compared
to
1.1,
that's
not
the
exact
figure
but
that's
comparable
to
it.
the
court
--
the
trial
court
found
that
in
the
-
in
favor
of
the
defendants
at
a
particular
issue
on
the
buildings.
and
the
court
held
that
by
reason
of
the
evidence
that
--
that
there
were
new
additions
to
the
older
buildings
that
they
were
remodeled
and
they
had
adequate
modern
lighting,
modern
ceiling
and
so
forth,
that
there
was
no
unreasonable
allocation
there.
there
is
no
evidence
of
any
inadequacy
in
any
of
the
equipment
or
in
any
of
the
supplies.
there
is
no
discrimination
in
transportation
of
the
people
who
had
to
be
transported,
they're
all
transported
in
the
same
buses.
there
is
no
discrimination
in
the
extra-curricular
activities
and
sports
program.
insofar
as
allocation
and
moneys
were
concerned,
the
only
evidence
was
that
these
schools
were
allocated
a
greater
amount
than
the
other
schools.
this
included,
not
federal
funds
and
state
funds,
but
they
did
have
a
greater
allocation
of
money.
mr.
william
k.
ris
yes
sir.
the
school
with
the
lower
--
or
with
the
lowest
achievement
results.
so
that
basically,
the
only
thing
that
the
court
draft
or
came
up
with
at
all
was
a
matter
of
teachers,
teacher
experience.
now,
every
teacher
in
colorado
has
to
be
a
college
graduate,
have
a
degree,
being
licensed
by
the
state.
and
even
the
trial
court
did
not
find
that
there
was
such
a
disparity
here
between
the
teachers'
comment
about
it
as
an
addition
is
what
the
trial
court
used
all
the
way
through,
various
rendition
of
inferiority.
some
of
which
were
resources
that
are
complained
of
by
the
plaintiffs
and
others
were
the
achievement
results,
for
example,
the
dropout.
it
has
to
be
kept
in
my
mind
that
some
of
the
causes
potentially
and
some
effects,
but
the
teachers
were
the
only
thing
that
the
district
court
even
alluded
to.
there
is
an
issue
of
inferiority
(inaudible)
and
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
that
was
not
such
a
substantial
factor
as
to
constitute
an
unequal
resource
being
furnished.
and
even
the
evidence
itself
did
not
support
that.
dr.
coleman,
for
example,
stated
that
the
experience
of
teachers
is
far
overrated.
some
of
the
--
mr.
william
k.
ris
he
was
the
plaintiff's
witness
your
honor.
mr.
william
k.
ris
yes
sir.
mr.
william
k.
ris
i'm
trying
to
--
i'm
trying
to
think
of
what
--
of
what
exhibit
might
be
available
to
disclose
that
then
in
the
(inaudible)
i
--
i
don't
believe
there
is
on
a
per
people
or
even
on
a
per
school
basis
if
it
was
a
general
testimony,
and
i'm
not
sure
they
have
any
statistics
in
the
record
yet.
mr.
william
k.
ris
on
that?
no,
sir.
but
there's
not
a
specific
findings
in
the
contrary
that
was
the
sole
evidence.
mr.
william
k.
ris
he
found
inferiority
--
mr.
william
k.
ris
in
totality,
but
the
only
--
the
only
thing
that
he
referred
to
specifically,
insofar
as
allocated
resources
was
the
younger
teachers,
plus
inexperienced
teachers.
beyond
that,
there
was
talk
about
dropout
rates,
lower
achievement
scores
and
so
forth.
on
the
achievement
scores,
of
course,
as
the
attorney
general's
brief
points
out,
he
took
the
achievement's
course.
he
took
the
fact
of
arrangement
balance
and
put
the
two
together
but
without
any
evidence,
without
any
finding
really
of
cause
relationship.
mr.
william
k.
ris
they
were
--
mr.
william
k.
ris
but
he
found
expressly
the
--
mr.
brown
that
it
was
not
the
substantial
factor
and
not
a
really
material
fact.
he
request
the
--
i
i
kept
the
moment
to
point
out
exactly
where
this
is
to
find.
mr.
william
k.
ris
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
william
k.
ris
he
expressed
the
client
that
it
was
not
a
potential
contributory
factor
into
inferiority.
mr.
william
k.
ris
i
think
that
is
correct.
and
i
think
which
one
it
was
that
that's
going
again
at
co-counsel.
insofar
as
the
other
factors
on
relationship,
the
plaintiffs
relied
on
various
experts,
dr.
dan
dodson
who
was
the
only
expert
to
testify
to
hearing
the
merits
than
on
the
hearing
of
the
remedies,
dr.
coleman,
dr.
o'reilly,
and
these
were
called
in
and
dr.
sullivan.
all
of
whom
had
no
knowledge
whatsoever
of
the
denver
situation.
they
never
studied
denver
situation.
they
had
no
statistics
on
denver.
they
were
talking
merely
as
educators
or
sociologist
or
psychologist
from
other
parts
of
the
country.
one
originally
from
berkley,
down
in
massachusetts,
and
other
psychologists
from
the
new
york
state
board
education
and
of
course,
they
had
dr.
coleman.
but
again,
insofar
as
finding
a
causation
between
racial
imbalance
and
educational
achievement,
the
record
insofar
as
any
virtual
evidence
concerned
is
as
completely
signed.
dr.
coleman
was
with
of
the
opinion
that
it
was
a
basically
a
culture
deprivation
in
the
lower
socio-economic
family
groups
and
neighborhoods.
and
that
only
to
the
extent
that
minorities
were
found
in
those
particular
areas.
was
there
any
relationship
at
all?
but
he
was
looking
solely
of
the
family
background
and
the
cultural
background
of
these
children.
and
dr.
dodson
went
on
agreeing
things
about
various
attitudes
in
this
community
and
of
teachers
and
pupils
and
parents
and
so
forth,
not
with
any
relationship
to
the
denver
situation
but
just
generally
as
a
--
as
a
sociologist
might
do,
and
again,
a
complete
lack
of
cause
relationship.
dr.
o'reilly,
who
is
called
in
rebuttal
by
the
plaintiffs
and
the
remedy
hearing
pointed
out
that
this
whole
manner
of
educational
equalities,
the
very
unsettled
appeal,
said
many
years
of
experimentation
would
be
necessary
to
slowly
and
carefully
identify
and
develop
the
program
to
try
to
eliminate
it.
it's
an
educational
process.
so
as
far
as
the
quarter
of
schools,
we
have
a
finding
by
the
court,
the
trial
court,
which
not
attacked
here
that
if
it
is
not
a
brown
situation,
no
brown
constitutional
violation
by
reason
of
the
evidence
concerning
the
so-called
inputs
or
the
allocation
of
resources
except
for
the
teachers
and
even
the
court
of
appeals
so
that
there
was
no
plus
evaluations.
so
that
what
do
we
end
up
with?
we
end
up
with
an
educational
problem
that
the
educators
have
no
answer
for.
the
state
of
the
science
has
not
such
that
a
district
court
can
decree
you
shall
do
this,
that
and
the
other
thing,
but
it
is
something
that
dr.
o'reilly
said,
as
dr.
gilberts,
the
superintendent
of
the
schools
who
was
the
principal
expert
of
defense
says,
“as
we
worked
out
over
a
period
of
time.”
and
we
suggest
to
the
court
that
this
is
something
that
is
being
done
and
has
to
be
done
but
it
is
not
a
constitutional
violation
to
remedied.
it's
an
educational
problem
which
has
to
be
handled
at
a
local
level
and
it's
something
that
is
beyond
the
confidence
of
the
federal
judiciary.
the
educators
served
with
all
their
know-how
or
having
a
harder
time
and
certainly,
it's
not
something
that
can
be
decreed
in
such
as
furnishing
counsel,
furnishing
transcript,
furnishing
people's
facilities
of
physical
nature.
and
so,
basically,
on
one
hand,
we
say
that
there's
no
constitutional
violation
and
therefore,
there
is
no
remedy
and
even
if
there
were
constitutional
violation,
we
have
to
compensate
the
courts.
thank
you.
