justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
may
i
ask
you
a
question
at
that
point?
i
think
i
have
the
same
view
that
judge
--
justice
stewart
expressed
that
both
of
the
courts
below
had
found
that
the
segregation
in
the
core
area
was
not
the
result
of
the
de
jure
state
action.
now,
let's
assume
for
the
moment
that
this
court
concluded
that
if
it
were
bound
by
that
finding,
would
it
be
our
position
that
this
court
should
then
consider
or
reconsider
whether
or
not
the
distinction
between
the
de
jure
and
de
facto
segregation
is
now
a
valid
one?
