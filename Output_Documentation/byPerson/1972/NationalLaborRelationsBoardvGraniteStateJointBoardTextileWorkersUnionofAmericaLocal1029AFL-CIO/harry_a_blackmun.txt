come,
were
those
public
votes
in
the
sense
that
they
were
not
secret
ballots?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
mr.
roitman,
suppose
at
that
point,
some
of
them
had
voted
against
the
strike
and
the
strike
board
having
been
taken,
there
upon
resign,
would
your
position
as
to
them
be
any
different?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
then
i
take
it
that
you
are
insisting,
sticking
upon
the
ten-day
provision?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
mr.
roitman,
i
am
still
bothered
a
little
bit
of
this
ten-day
provision.
i
take
it,
your
position
essentially
is
just
that
the
section
7
rights
have
been
waived,
except
as
to
the
ten-day
provision
during
that
period.
now
suppose
there
weren't
any
ten-day
provision
at
all?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
but
with
a
ten-day
provision
that
is
not
so?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
and
if
it
were
one-day
provision,
it
would
not
be
so?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
on
that
basis
it
doesn't
seem
to
me
there
there
should
any
difference
between
one
day
or
not?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
once
having
accepted
it,
except
by
the
information
--
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
they
would
be
barred
--
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
mr.
roitman,
is
it
your
position
that
the
obligation
of
the
union
members
continued
for
the
duration
of
the
strike
regardless
of
how
long
the
strike
lasted?
