justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
i
gather
there
is
no
issue
here
of
membership?
it's
conceded
all
that
were
involved
were
members
of
the
union?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
is
there
any
issue
of
the
reasonableness
of
the
fine?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
i
want
to
be
clear
mr.
come.
no
resignation
was
submitted
in
any
of
the
31
cases.
so
until
after
that
meeting
at
which
the
resolution
was
passed
that
anyone
who
crossed
the
picket
line
would
be
subject
to
a
fine
of
$2,000.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
is
it
that
fact
that
the
board
relies
on
particularly?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
suppose
the
results
would
be
the
same
in
your
submission
mr.
come
if
there
were
an
express
provision
to
that
effect
in
the
constitution?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
expect
that
if
the
board
prevails
in
this
case,
you
will
get
that
chance
pretty
soon?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
n.
come
do
i
though
understand
correctly
that
basically
the
board's
position
is
to
--
without
regard
to
all
these
special
factors,
the
union's
authority
begins
and
ends
of
with
what
it
may
do
with
a
member,
and
once
one
has
resigned,
he
is
no
longer
a
member,
and
therefore,
a
conduct
after
resignation
is
simply
not
subject
to
union
discipline
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
is
that
it
basically?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
then
this
position,
mr.
roitman,
that
is
to
all
31,
none
having
resigned
within
the
ten-day
period
at
the
termination
of
the
contract
and
within
the
first
ten
days
of
the
strike,
they
remained
members
after
that
ten-day
period?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
that
is
sometime
where
the
consequence
of
that
form
of
collective
--
a
provision
of
the
collective
bargaining,
isn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what's
new
hampshire
law
on
the
question
whether
one
is
still
a
member
if
he
doesn't
resign
within
a
period
like
this?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
which
court?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what's
your
view
whether
that's
a
matter
of
state
law
or
whether
it
becomes
involved
with
--?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
may
i
ask
you,
i
have
been
looking
in
the
appended
record
but
can't
locate
a
form
of
application
for
membership
which
includes
that
ten-day
provision?
have
i
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
thank
you.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
thank
you,
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
suppose
we
were
to
say
that
if
you've
signed
in
it,
you
did
not
know
about
it,
and
it
was
effective,
and
then
say
is
to
whether
or
not
they
were
members
at
the
time
they
actually
resigned?
