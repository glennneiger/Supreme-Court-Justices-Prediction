mr.
norton
j.
come
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
certiorari
to
the
first
circuit,
which
denied
enforcement
of
the
board's
order
against
respondent
union,
a
local
of
the
textile
workers
union.
the
case
involves
an
application
of
the
principles
formulated
by
this
court
in
the
allis-chalmers
and
scofield
cases.
section
8(b)(1)(a)
of
the
national
labor
relations
act
makes
it
an
unfair
labor
practice
for
a
union
to
restrain
or
coerce
employees
in
the
exercise
of
their
section
7
rights
which
includes
the
right
to
engage
in
concerted
activity
and
the
right
to
refrain
from
engaging
in
concerted
activity.
the
question
presented
here
is
whether
a
union
violates
section
8(b)(1)(a)
by
fining
employees
who
return
to
work
during
the
strike
after
they
had
resigned
from
union
membership
and
by
seeking
judicial
enforcement
of
the
fines.
the
facts
are
briefly
these.
the
union
for
many
years
has
been
the
collective
bargaining
representative
of
the
employees
of
the
international
paper
box
machine
company
in
new
hampshire.
on
september
14,
1968,
six
days
before
the
scheduled
expiration
of
the
collective-bargaining
agreement,
the
union
membership
voted
to
strike,
if
a
new
agreement
was
not
reached
by
september
20.
no
agreement
reached
and
the
strike
was
attended,
and
picketing
began
on
that
day.
on
september
21,
the
union
held
a
meeting
to
discuss
strike
organization
in
which
the
membership
approved
the
resolution
to
anyone
aiding
or
abetting
the
company
would
be
subject
to
a
fine
of
$2,000.
all
but
three
or
four
of
the
160
employees
in
the
bargaining
unit
were
union
members
and
all
of
the
union
members
went
out
on
strike.
the
contract
that
had
just
expired
had
a
maintenance-of-membership
provision
in
it
which
required
employees
who
were
union
members
at
the
time
of
the
contract
became
effective
or
who
joined
the
union
during
the
term
of
the
contract
to
remain
members
during
the
contract
term.
practically,
all
of
the
union
members
attended
both
the
strike
authorization
and
the
fine
authorization
meetings.
the
members
assented
to
the
strike
by
a
standing
vote
with
only
one
member
dissenting.
the
motion
to
levy
the
fine
was
adopted
unanimously
without
discussion.
on
november
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
they
were
standing
votes.
they
were
not
secret
ballot
votes.
mr.
norton
j.
come
the
record
shows
that,
practically
all
of
the
members
attended.
the
court
of
appeals
and
the
trial
examiner
indicated
that
there
might
be
some
problem
in
future
compliance
proceedings
as
to
whether
all
of
the
31
who
were
subsequently
fined
were
there
or
not,
but
the
record
shows
that
practically
the
entire
membership
was
present
at
the
meeting.
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
is
correct
and
the
question
here
is
the
right
of
the
union
to
fine
the
members
after
they
had
resigned
from
the
union.
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
is
not
in
this
case.
that
is
pending
in
the
boeing
case
which
is
on
a
petition
for
certiorari,
but
the
court
has
not
acted
on
that.
about
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes.
mr.
norton
j.
come
under
the
principle
that
the
board
is
applying,
the
cut
off
is
whether
they
resigned
before
they
engaged
in
the
activity
for
which
they
are
being
fined.
in
another
words,
if
they
went
to
work
before
they
resigned,
in
the
board's
view,
under
allis-chalmers,
the
fine
would
be
okay.
if
they
resigned
before
they
went
to
work
and
then
were
fined,
in
the
board's
view,
that
would
not
be
protected
and
that's
what
you
have
in
this
case.
in
the
boeing
case,
you
have
also
a
mid-position
or
you
have
some
people
who
resigned
after
they
went
back
to
work
and
what
the
board
did
in
boeing
was
to
sustain
the
fine
as
to
the
activity
that
occurred,
the
strikebreaking
activity
that
occurred
before
the
resignation,
but
thereafter
held
that
the
fine
was
improper.
but
you
don't
have
that
mid-position
here
because
it's
perfectly
clear
that
all
of
the
31
employees
who
were
fined
first
took
the
step
of
notifying
the
union
of
their
resignation
before
they
went
back
to
work.
now
you
--
as
i
have
indicated,
during
the
course
of
this
strike
which
was
still
going
on
at
the
time
of
the
board's
second
hearing
which
was
18
months
after
its
inception,
you
had
31
employees
who,
beginning
some
month-and-a-half
to
two
months
and
the
poke
occurring
from
seven-and-a-half
to
twelve
months
during
the
course
of
the
strike,
submitted
resignations
to
the
union
and
went
back
to
work.
the
union
notified
them
that
they
had
--
were
in
violation
of
the
union
rules,
and
ordered
them
to
appear
for
a
hearing
before
the
union
tribunal.
they
did
not.
they
were
tried
in
absentia
and
fined
the
equivalent
of
a
day's
wages
for
each
day
work
during
the
strike.
and
when
none
of
the
employees
paid
the
fines,
the
union
filed
suits
in
the
state
courts
to
collect
the
fines.
the
suits
are
still
pending
and
the
employees
in
turn
filed
unfair
labor
practice
charges
with
the
board.
the
board
concluded
that
the
31
employees
had
affectively
resigned
from
the
union
before
returning
to
work,
that
the
union
violated
section
8(b)(1)(a)
of
the
act
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
is
correct.
mr.
norton
j.
come
it
was
that
fact
that
the
court
of
appeals
was
relied
on
in
reversing
the
board.
the
court
of
appeals
said
that
since
they
had
participated
in
the
strike
vote,
they
in
effect
had
by
analogy
to
the
charitable
subscription
line
of
cases
made
a
contract
with
the
union
to
see
the
strike
through,
and
the
board's
position
--
submission
that
strike
vote
is
not
sufficient
to
override
the
employee's
section
7
right
to
resign
from
the
union
and
go
back
to
work.
that's
the
issue
we
have
in
the
case.
well,
in
allis-chalmers,
this
court
held
that
a
union
did
not
violate
section
8(b)1(a)
of
the
act
by
fining
employees
who
went
to
work
during
the
strike
authorized
by
the
union
membership
and
by
suing
in
court
to
enforce
the
fines.
the
court,
balancing
the
union's
need
to
preserve
solidarity
during
the
strike
against
the
employee's
section
7
right
to
refrain
from
engaging
in
concerted
activities,
concluded
that
the
union
discipline
there
did
not
violate
section
8(b)(1)(a)
because
as
we
read
the
court's
opinion,
it
was
imposed
against
the
member
pursuing
through
the
contract
of
membership.
the
employees
there
were
full
members
of
the
union
and
the
infraction
of
the
union
strike
rule
occurred,
while
they
were
full
members
of
the
union,
and
therefore,
they
were
subject
to
the
union
discipline.
in
the
subsequent
scofield
case,
the
court
in
holding
that
the
union
did
not
violate
section
8(b)(1)(a)
by
levying
a
court
enforced
fine
against
employees
who
violated
a
union
production
rule
that
was
acquiesced
in
by
the
employer,
laid
down
this
test
which
we
think
is
applicable
here
for
applying
section
8(b)(1)(a),
namely
that
it
leaves
a
union
free
to
enforce
a
properly
adopted
rule
which
reflects
a
legitimate
union
interest,
impairs
no
policy
which
congress
has
embedded
in
the
labor
laws,
and
is
reasonably
enforced
against
union
members
who
are
free
to
leave
the
union
and
escape
the
rules.
now
we
think
that
the
principle
to
be
distilled
that's
relevant
here
is
that
the
power
to
levy
a
court
enforceable
fine
on
an
employee
for
breach
of
a
legitimate
union
rule
which
this
is,
is
co
terminus
with
the
union
member
contract
or
relationship
and
in
the
board's
view
that
was
terminated
here
by
the
resignations
for
this
reason.
the
union's
constitution
and
bylaws
contained
no
provision
defining
or
limiting
the
circumstances
under
which
a
member
could
resign
from
the
union.
under
the
law
of
governing
voluntary
associations,
where
there
is
no
specific
provision
with
respect
to
resignations,
it's
settled
that
a
member
may
resign
at
will.
now
the
union
contends
however
that
even
if
the
31
employees
could
thus
effectively
sever
ties
with
the
union.
even
the
court
of
appeals
was
willing
to
concede
that
the
absent
of
any
provision,
the
resignation
here
was
affective
for
most
purposes.
these
31
employees
were
none
the
less
bound
to
support
the
strike
until
its
conclusion
because
it's
only
reasonable
to
construe
the
union's
constitution
and
bylaws,
as
imposing
by
implication
and
obligation
to
see
a
strike
through
to
its
end
or
in
any
event,
that
conclusion
is
warranted
here
in
view
of
the
employee's
participation
in
the
strike
vote.
we
submit
that
neither
of
these
arguments
warrants
on
different
conclusion
here.
in
the
first
place
with
respect
to
implying
by
implication
an
obligation
in
the
union's
constitution
and
bylaws
to
see
the
strike
through
at
the
end
--
to
the
end,
we're
coming
across
a
very
important
right
that's
guaranteed
by
section
7
of
the
act
which
gives
to
all
employees,
including
union
members
the
right
to
refrain
from
engaging
in
concerted
activities.
mr.
norton
j.
come
i
would
say
your
honor
that
the
board
has
not
yet
had
occasion
to
consider
whether
a
different
accommodation
between
the
section
7
rights
of
the
employees
and
the
union's
right
to
impose
reasonable
discipline
would
be
warranted
if
there
were
such
information.
mr.
norton
j.
come
i
would
assume
so,
but
all
i
can
tell
you
is
that
up
until
now,
the
board
has
not
had
occasion
to
face
that
question,
and
it
has
reserved.
the
closest
that
the
board
has
come
to
it,
as
in
dealing
with
a
provision
in
a
union
constitution
that
provided
for
resignation
only
10
days
at
the
end
fiscal
year,
and
the
board
has
held
that
that
provision
doesn't
give
any
meaningful
right
to
resign
in
terms
of
a
strike
situation
and
reach
the
same
result
in
that
case
as
it
did
in
this
case
where
there
is
no
such
provision,
but
it
has
not
yet
indicated
what
it
would
do,
where
you
had
a
rule
that
was
specifically
tailored
to
a
particular
situation.
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
is
correct.
that
would
be
the
conclusion
that
the
board
would
have
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
there
are
instances
where
waivers
have
been
upheld
and
it
really
comes
down
to
a
basic
and
board's
and
the
court's
judgment
would
be
as
to
the
right
to
refrain
is
in
section
7.
there
are
some
rights
that
have
been
held
not
to
be
a
waiver.
now,
given
the
statutory
right
in
section
7,
however,
it
is
well
settled
that
a
waiver
of
statutory
rights
if
it
can
be
waived,
has
got
to
be
expressed,
and
you
would
go
against
that
principle
if
you
found
a
waiver
by
implication
in
the
constitution
and
bylaws
here.
secondly,
there
is
very
good
reason,
for
not
the
party
from
the
principle
of
requiring
an
express
waiver
because
a
contract
of
membership
is
a
rather
unusual
contract.
a
member
becomes
bond
by
the
union's
constitution
and
bylaws
upon
joining
the
union
even
though
he
had
no
real
part
in
formulating
the
provisions
of
the
contract.
it's
like
a
contract
of
adhesion
similar
to
an
insurance
policy,
and
the
principle
applicable
there
is
between
two
possible
interpretations,
you
give
the
break
of
the
party
who
had
no
part
in
formulating
the
terms
of
the
contract,
and
thirdly,
the
decision
whether
to
resign
from
a
union
and
return
to
work
during
a
strike
presents
the
employee
with
a
very,
very
difficult
choice,
a
choice
that
can
be
most
meaningfully
made
in
the
particular
strike
situation.
therefore,
it
can't
readily
be
assumed
that
a
employee
if
he
could
waive
the
right
would
willingly
want
to
do
so
by
implication.
four,
while
the
employees
may
be
sympathetic
to
a
strike
when
it's
first
called,
events
occurring
thereafter
which
he
may
not
have
anticipated,
may
lead
him
to
alter
his
view
and
a
desire
to
return
to
work.
for
example,
he
may
have
underestimated
the
time
that
the
strike
is
going
to
take.
this
strike,
as
i
indicated,
was
going
on
for
at
least
18
months.
and
underestimating
the
duration,
he
may
have
underestimated
the
resultant
hardship
to
himself,
to
his
family
or
underestimated
the
employer's
ability
to
find
replacements
for
him.
on
the
other
hand,
the
decision
to
resign
from
the
union
and
abandon
the
strike
is
going
to
subject
the
employee
to
the
individual
to
his
right
to
participate
in
union
meetings,
to
which
policies
are
formulated,
both
for
union
officers.
it
may
deprive
them
of
certain
union
benefits,
subject
them
to
a
certain
social
stigma.
so
he
has
a
difficult
choice
to
make
here
and
we
submit
that
the
policies
of
the
act
are
thus
effectuated
by
holding
as
the
board
has,
that
if
he
can
waive
his
right
at
all,
it
has
to
be
an
express
waiver.
now
what
about
the
strike
mode
here
which
is
what
the
court
of
appeals
relied
on
as
making
the
difference?
we
believe
that
the
strike
for
vote
is
an
unreliable
basis
for
determining
rights
and
obligations
under
the
act,
particularly
where
it
was
by
a
voice
vote
such
as
you
had
here
because
the
employees
may
be
induced
the
strike
by
a
bandwagon
psychology.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
one
of
the
employees
here
testified
that,
yes,
he
stood
up,
but
he
stood
up
because
everybody
else
was
standing
up.
but
be
that
as
it
may,
assuming
that
you
really
wanted
to
support
the
strike,
we
believe
that
it's
unrealistic
to
conclude
that
any
employee
voting
to
strike
in
68,
knowingly
made
a
waiver
to
support
that
strike
to
the
bitter
end
no
matter
how
long
it
went
on
or
no
matter
what
his
own
personal
situation
may
have
developed.
certainly
we
believe
that
it's
unreasonable
to
attribute
to
the
employee
in
intention
to
support
the
strike
even
after
he
would
be
willing
to
take
the
very
severe
step
of
resigning
from
the
union.
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes.
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
the
record
doesn't
show
specifically
what
happened
to
them,
i
can
only
generalize
that
normally,
resigning
from
the
union,
the
individual
loses
the
right
to
participate
in
union
meetings
at
which
policies
are
determined
the
--
and
also
the
right
to
vote
for
the
officers
of
the
union
who
are
going
to
be
his
bargaining
representative.
mr.
norton
j.
come
no,
it
could
not
have
prevented
them
for
being
reemployed.
there
is
one
thing
that
the
union
cannot
do,
and
that
is
to
affect
a
job
right.
now
you
talked
about
the
kind
of
contract
that
they
had.
the
kind
of
contract
that
they
had
was
a
maintenance-of-membership,
a
contract
which
doesn't
require
you
to
be
a
member
in
order
to
keep
your
employment.
if
they
had
been
successful
in
getting
a
union
shop
agreement
which
they
did
not
have,
under
a
union-shop
agreement,
you
have
to
become
a
member
of
the
union
within
30
days.
they
might
have
been
able
to
require
that
they
pay
dues
as
a
condition
of
continuing
employment
under
the
taft-hartley
act,
that
kind
of
thing,
but
you
could
not
require
them,
at
least
as
we
understand
the
law,
to
actually
become
a
full
member
of
the
union
and
thus
subject
themselves
to
union
discipline.
and
a
further
point
that
i
wanted
to
make
is
that
in
most
strike
situations,
the
vote
is
not
by
standing
vote,
but
by
secret
ballot
and
to
try
to
find
out
how
somebody
voted
where
it's
by
secret
ballot
would
impair
the
secrecy
of
the
ballot
and
lead
to
further
complications,
and
finally,
if
you
made
the
strike
vote
determinative,
we
believe
that
there
is
a
serious
risk
of
deterring
union
democracy
because
employees
would
be
fearful
that
by
participating
in
the
vote
or
in
the
discussions,
that
they
might
be
hooked
forever
respective
of
what
may
develop
might
decide
to
play
it
safe
and
not
participate
which
is
certainly
not
a
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes
sir.
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
is
it.
for
these
reasons,
we
submit
that
the
judgment
of
the
court
below
should
be
reversed,
and
the
case
should
be
remanded
with
directions
to
enforce
the
court's
order.
mr.
norton
j.
come
i
just
wanted
to
point
out
as
mr.
justice
rehnquist
noted
that
the
court
of
appeals
found
on
pages
5
(a)
to
6
(a)
of
the
petition,
adopted
a
trial
examiner's
finding
that
there
was
no
evidence
that
the
employees
knew
of
this
practice
or
that
they
considered
this
limitation
and
their
right
to
resign,
that
is
with
respect
to
this
ten-day
point
that
mr.
roitman
has
been
making.
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
i
think
that
there
you
would
have
an
issue
that
would
probably
have
to
be
remanded
to
the
board
because
as
the
board
found
the
facts
here,
this
ten-day
provision
was
not
something
first
of
all
that
had
anything
to
do
with
resigning
from
the
union.
it
was
a
combination
of
membership
and
check-off
clause.
the
trail
examiner
found
that
the
ten-day
provision
related
only
to
the
check-off
provision,
not
to
the
resignation
from
union
membership.
he
further
found
that
there
was
no
evidence
in
the
record
that
showed
that
the
employees
were
made
aware
that
this
was
the
way
that
you
had
to
resign
from
the
union.
the
court
of
appeals
sustained
that
finding.
we
submit
that
it
is
supported
by
a
substantial
evidence
for
the
additional
reason,
as
justice
marshall
pointed
out
that
nowhere
in
the
letters
that
were
sent
to
the
employees,
as
to
--
has
any
mention
made
of
the
fact
that
the
resignation
was
improper
because
it
didn't
comply
with
the
ten-day
rule.
thank
you.
mr.
norton
j.
come
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
certiorari
to
the
first
circuit,
which
denied
enforcement
of
the
board's
order
against
respondent
union,
a
local
of
the
textile
workers
union.
the
case
involves
an
application
of
the
principles
formulated
by
this
court
in
the
allis-chalmers
and
scofield
cases.
section
8(b)(1)(a)
of
the
national
labor
relations
act
makes
it
an
unfair
labor
practice
for
a
union
to
restrain
or
coerce
employees
in
the
exercise
of
their
section
7
rights
which
includes
the
right
to
engage
in
concerted
activity
and
the
right
to
refrain
from
engaging
in
concerted
activity.
the
question
presented
here
is
whether
a
union
violates
section
8(b)(1)(a)
by
fining
employees
who
return
to
work
during
the
strike
after
they
had
resigned
from
union
membership
and
by
seeking
judicial
enforcement
of
the
fines.
the
facts
are
briefly
these.
the
union
for
many
years
has
been
the
collective
bargaining
representative
of
the
employees
of
the
international
paper
box
machine
company
in
new
hampshire.
on
september
14,
1968,
six
days
before
the
scheduled
expiration
of
the
collective-bargaining
agreement,
the
union
membership
voted
to
strike,
if
a
new
agreement
was
not
reached
by
september
20.
no
agreement
reached
and
the
strike
was
attended,
and
picketing
began
on
that
day.
on
september
21,
the
union
held
a
meeting
to
discuss
strike
organization
in
which
the
membership
approved
the
resolution
to
anyone
aiding
or
abetting
the
company
would
be
subject
to
a
fine
of
$2,000.
all
but
three
or
four
of
the
160
employees
in
the
bargaining
unit
were
union
members
and
all
of
the
union
members
went
out
on
strike.
the
contract
that
had
just
expired
had
a
maintenance-of-membership
provision
in
it
which
required
employees
who
were
union
members
at
the
time
of
the
contract
became
effective
or
who
joined
the
union
during
the
term
of
the
contract
to
remain
members
during
the
contract
term.
practically,
all
of
the
union
members
attended
both
the
strike
authorization
and
the
fine
authorization
meetings.
the
members
assented
to
the
strike
by
a
standing
vote
with
only
one
member
dissenting.
the
motion
to
levy
the
fine
was
adopted
unanimously
without
discussion.
on
november
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
they
were
standing
votes.
they
were
not
secret
ballot
votes.
mr.
norton
j.
come
the
record
shows
that,
practically
all
of
the
members
attended.
the
court
of
appeals
and
the
trial
examiner
indicated
that
there
might
be
some
problem
in
future
compliance
proceedings
as
to
whether
all
of
the
31
who
were
subsequently
fined
were
there
or
not,
but
the
record
shows
that
practically
the
entire
membership
was
present
at
the
meeting.
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
is
correct
and
the
question
here
is
the
right
of
the
union
to
fine
the
members
after
they
had
resigned
from
the
union.
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
is
not
in
this
case.
that
is
pending
in
the
boeing
case
which
is
on
a
petition
for
certiorari,
but
the
court
has
not
acted
on
that.
about
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes.
mr.
norton
j.
come
under
the
principle
that
the
board
is
applying,
the
cut
off
is
whether
they
resigned
before
they
engaged
in
the
activity
for
which
they
are
being
fined.
in
another
words,
if
they
went
to
work
before
they
resigned,
in
the
board's
view,
under
allis-chalmers,
the
fine
would
be
okay.
if
they
resigned
before
they
went
to
work
and
then
were
fined,
in
the
board's
view,
that
would
not
be
protected
and
that's
what
you
have
in
this
case.
in
the
boeing
case,
you
have
also
a
mid-position
or
you
have
some
people
who
resigned
after
they
went
back
to
work
and
what
the
board
did
in
boeing
was
to
sustain
the
fine
as
to
the
activity
that
occurred,
the
strikebreaking
activity
that
occurred
before
the
resignation,
but
thereafter
held
that
the
fine
was
improper.
but
you
don't
have
that
mid-position
here
because
it's
perfectly
clear
that
all
of
the
31
employees
who
were
fined
first
took
the
step
of
notifying
the
union
of
their
resignation
before
they
went
back
to
work.
now
you
--
as
i
have
indicated,
during
the
course
of
this
strike
which
was
still
going
on
at
the
time
of
the
board's
second
hearing
which
was
18
months
after
its
inception,
you
had
31
employees
who,
beginning
some
month-and-a-half
to
two
months
and
the
poke
occurring
from
seven-and-a-half
to
twelve
months
during
the
course
of
the
strike,
submitted
resignations
to
the
union
and
went
back
to
work.
the
union
notified
them
that
they
had
--
were
in
violation
of
the
union
rules,
and
ordered
them
to
appear
for
a
hearing
before
the
union
tribunal.
they
did
not.
they
were
tried
in
absentia
and
fined
the
equivalent
of
a
day's
wages
for
each
day
work
during
the
strike.
and
when
none
of
the
employees
paid
the
fines,
the
union
filed
suits
in
the
state
courts
to
collect
the
fines.
the
suits
are
still
pending
and
the
employees
in
turn
filed
unfair
labor
practice
charges
with
the
board.
the
board
concluded
that
the
31
employees
had
affectively
resigned
from
the
union
before
returning
to
work,
that
the
union
violated
section
8(b)(1)(a)
of
the
act
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
is
correct.
mr.
norton
j.
come
it
was
that
fact
that
the
court
of
appeals
was
relied
on
in
reversing
the
board.
the
court
of
appeals
said
that
since
they
had
participated
in
the
strike
vote,
they
in
effect
had
by
analogy
to
the
charitable
subscription
line
of
cases
made
a
contract
with
the
union
to
see
the
strike
through,
and
the
board's
position
--
submission
that
strike
vote
is
not
sufficient
to
override
the
employee's
section
7
right
to
resign
from
the
union
and
go
back
to
work.
that's
the
issue
we
have
in
the
case.
well,
in
allis-chalmers,
this
court
held
that
a
union
did
not
violate
section
8(b)1(a)
of
the
act
by
fining
employees
who
went
to
work
during
the
strike
authorized
by
the
union
membership
and
by
suing
in
court
to
enforce
the
fines.
the
court,
balancing
the
union's
need
to
preserve
solidarity
during
the
strike
against
the
employee's
section
7
right
to
refrain
from
engaging
in
concerted
activities,
concluded
that
the
union
discipline
there
did
not
violate
section
8(b)(1)(a)
because
as
we
read
the
court's
opinion,
it
was
imposed
against
the
member
pursuing
through
the
contract
of
membership.
the
employees
there
were
full
members
of
the
union
and
the
infraction
of
the
union
strike
rule
occurred,
while
they
were
full
members
of
the
union,
and
therefore,
they
were
subject
to
the
union
discipline.
in
the
subsequent
scofield
case,
the
court
in
holding
that
the
union
did
not
violate
section
8(b)(1)(a)
by
levying
a
court
enforced
fine
against
employees
who
violated
a
union
production
rule
that
was
acquiesced
in
by
the
employer,
laid
down
this
test
which
we
think
is
applicable
here
for
applying
section
8(b)(1)(a),
namely
that
it
leaves
a
union
free
to
enforce
a
properly
adopted
rule
which
reflects
a
legitimate
union
interest,
impairs
no
policy
which
congress
has
embedded
in
the
labor
laws,
and
is
reasonably
enforced
against
union
members
who
are
free
to
leave
the
union
and
escape
the
rules.
now
we
think
that
the
principle
to
be
distilled
that's
relevant
here
is
that
the
power
to
levy
a
court
enforceable
fine
on
an
employee
for
breach
of
a
legitimate
union
rule
which
this
is,
is
co
terminus
with
the
union
member
contract
or
relationship
and
in
the
board's
view
that
was
terminated
here
by
the
resignations
for
this
reason.
the
union's
constitution
and
bylaws
contained
no
provision
defining
or
limiting
the
circumstances
under
which
a
member
could
resign
from
the
union.
under
the
law
of
governing
voluntary
associations,
where
there
is
no
specific
provision
with
respect
to
resignations,
it's
settled
that
a
member
may
resign
at
will.
now
the
union
contends
however
that
even
if
the
31
employees
could
thus
effectively
sever
ties
with
the
union.
even
the
court
of
appeals
was
willing
to
concede
that
the
absent
of
any
provision,
the
resignation
here
was
affective
for
most
purposes.
these
31
employees
were
none
the
less
bound
to
support
the
strike
until
its
conclusion
because
it's
only
reasonable
to
construe
the
union's
constitution
and
bylaws,
as
imposing
by
implication
and
obligation
to
see
a
strike
through
to
its
end
or
in
any
event,
that
conclusion
is
warranted
here
in
view
of
the
employee's
participation
in
the
strike
vote.
we
submit
that
neither
of
these
arguments
warrants
on
different
conclusion
here.
in
the
first
place
with
respect
to
implying
by
implication
an
obligation
in
the
union's
constitution
and
bylaws
to
see
the
strike
through
at
the
end
--
to
the
end,
we're
coming
across
a
very
important
right
that's
guaranteed
by
section
7
of
the
act
which
gives
to
all
employees,
including
union
members
the
right
to
refrain
from
engaging
in
concerted
activities.
mr.
norton
j.
come
i
would
say
your
honor
that
the
board
has
not
yet
had
occasion
to
consider
whether
a
different
accommodation
between
the
section
7
rights
of
the
employees
and
the
union's
right
to
impose
reasonable
discipline
would
be
warranted
if
there
were
such
information.
mr.
norton
j.
come
i
would
assume
so,
but
all
i
can
tell
you
is
that
up
until
now,
the
board
has
not
had
occasion
to
face
that
question,
and
it
has
reserved.
the
closest
that
the
board
has
come
to
it,
as
in
dealing
with
a
provision
in
a
union
constitution
that
provided
for
resignation
only
10
days
at
the
end
fiscal
year,
and
the
board
has
held
that
that
provision
doesn't
give
any
meaningful
right
to
resign
in
terms
of
a
strike
situation
and
reach
the
same
result
in
that
case
as
it
did
in
this
case
where
there
is
no
such
provision,
but
it
has
not
yet
indicated
what
it
would
do,
where
you
had
a
rule
that
was
specifically
tailored
to
a
particular
situation.
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
is
correct.
that
would
be
the
conclusion
that
the
board
would
have
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
there
are
instances
where
waivers
have
been
upheld
and
it
really
comes
down
to
a
basic
and
board's
and
the
court's
judgment
would
be
as
to
the
right
to
refrain
is
in
section
7.
there
are
some
rights
that
have
been
held
not
to
be
a
waiver.
now,
given
the
statutory
right
in
section
7,
however,
it
is
well
settled
that
a
waiver
of
statutory
rights
if
it
can
be
waived,
has
got
to
be
expressed,
and
you
would
go
against
that
principle
if
you
found
a
waiver
by
implication
in
the
constitution
and
bylaws
here.
secondly,
there
is
very
good
reason,
for
not
the
party
from
the
principle
of
requiring
an
express
waiver
because
a
contract
of
membership
is
a
rather
unusual
contract.
a
member
becomes
bond
by
the
union's
constitution
and
bylaws
upon
joining
the
union
even
though
he
had
no
real
part
in
formulating
the
provisions
of
the
contract.
it's
like
a
contract
of
adhesion
similar
to
an
insurance
policy,
and
the
principle
applicable
there
is
between
two
possible
interpretations,
you
give
the
break
of
the
party
who
had
no
part
in
formulating
the
terms
of
the
contract,
and
thirdly,
the
decision
whether
to
resign
from
a
union
and
return
to
work
during
a
strike
presents
the
employee
with
a
very,
very
difficult
choice,
a
choice
that
can
be
most
meaningfully
made
in
the
particular
strike
situation.
therefore,
it
can't
readily
be
assumed
that
a
employee
if
he
could
waive
the
right
would
willingly
want
to
do
so
by
implication.
four,
while
the
employees
may
be
sympathetic
to
a
strike
when
it's
first
called,
events
occurring
thereafter
which
he
may
not
have
anticipated,
may
lead
him
to
alter
his
view
and
a
desire
to
return
to
work.
for
example,
he
may
have
underestimated
the
time
that
the
strike
is
going
to
take.
this
strike,
as
i
indicated,
was
going
on
for
at
least
18
months.
and
underestimating
the
duration,
he
may
have
underestimated
the
resultant
hardship
to
himself,
to
his
family
or
underestimated
the
employer's
ability
to
find
replacements
for
him.
on
the
other
hand,
the
decision
to
resign
from
the
union
and
abandon
the
strike
is
going
to
subject
the
employee
to
the
individual
to
his
right
to
participate
in
union
meetings,
to
which
policies
are
formulated,
both
for
union
officers.
it
may
deprive
them
of
certain
union
benefits,
subject
them
to
a
certain
social
stigma.
so
he
has
a
difficult
choice
to
make
here
and
we
submit
that
the
policies
of
the
act
are
thus
effectuated
by
holding
as
the
board
has,
that
if
he
can
waive
his
right
at
all,
it
has
to
be
an
express
waiver.
now
what
about
the
strike
mode
here
which
is
what
the
court
of
appeals
relied
on
as
making
the
difference?
we
believe
that
the
strike
for
vote
is
an
unreliable
basis
for
determining
rights
and
obligations
under
the
act,
particularly
where
it
was
by
a
voice
vote
such
as
you
had
here
because
the
employees
may
be
induced
the
strike
by
a
bandwagon
psychology.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
one
of
the
employees
here
testified
that,
yes,
he
stood
up,
but
he
stood
up
because
everybody
else
was
standing
up.
but
be
that
as
it
may,
assuming
that
you
really
wanted
to
support
the
strike,
we
believe
that
it's
unrealistic
to
conclude
that
any
employee
voting
to
strike
in
68,
knowingly
made
a
waiver
to
support
that
strike
to
the
bitter
end
no
matter
how
long
it
went
on
or
no
matter
what
his
own
personal
situation
may
have
developed.
certainly
we
believe
that
it's
unreasonable
to
attribute
to
the
employee
in
intention
to
support
the
strike
even
after
he
would
be
willing
to
take
the
very
severe
step
of
resigning
from
the
union.
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes.
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
the
record
doesn't
show
specifically
what
happened
to
them,
i
can
only
generalize
that
normally,
resigning
from
the
union,
the
individual
loses
the
right
to
participate
in
union
meetings
at
which
policies
are
determined
the
--
and
also
the
right
to
vote
for
the
officers
of
the
union
who
are
going
to
be
his
bargaining
representative.
mr.
norton
j.
come
no,
it
could
not
have
prevented
them
for
being
reemployed.
there
is
one
thing
that
the
union
cannot
do,
and
that
is
to
affect
a
job
right.
now
you
talked
about
the
kind
of
contract
that
they
had.
the
kind
of
contract
that
they
had
was
a
maintenance-of-membership,
a
contract
which
doesn't
require
you
to
be
a
member
in
order
to
keep
your
employment.
if
they
had
been
successful
in
getting
a
union
shop
agreement
which
they
did
not
have,
under
a
union-shop
agreement,
you
have
to
become
a
member
of
the
union
within
30
days.
they
might
have
been
able
to
require
that
they
pay
dues
as
a
condition
of
continuing
employment
under
the
taft-hartley
act,
that
kind
of
thing,
but
you
could
not
require
them,
at
least
as
we
understand
the
law,
to
actually
become
a
full
member
of
the
union
and
thus
subject
themselves
to
union
discipline.
and
a
further
point
that
i
wanted
to
make
is
that
in
most
strike
situations,
the
vote
is
not
by
standing
vote,
but
by
secret
ballot
and
to
try
to
find
out
how
somebody
voted
where
it's
by
secret
ballot
would
impair
the
secrecy
of
the
ballot
and
lead
to
further
complications,
and
finally,
if
you
made
the
strike
vote
determinative,
we
believe
that
there
is
a
serious
risk
of
deterring
union
democracy
because
employees
would
be
fearful
that
by
participating
in
the
vote
or
in
the
discussions,
that
they
might
be
hooked
forever
respective
of
what
may
develop
might
decide
to
play
it
safe
and
not
participate
which
is
certainly
not
a
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes
sir.
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
is
it.
for
these
reasons,
we
submit
that
the
judgment
of
the
court
below
should
be
reversed,
and
the
case
should
be
remanded
with
directions
to
enforce
the
court's
order.
mr.
norton
j.
come
i
just
wanted
to
point
out
as
mr.
justice
rehnquist
noted
that
the
court
of
appeals
found
on
pages
5
(a)
to
6
(a)
of
the
petition,
adopted
a
trial
examiner's
finding
that
there
was
no
evidence
that
the
employees
knew
of
this
practice
or
that
they
considered
this
limitation
and
their
right
to
resign,
that
is
with
respect
to
this
ten-day
point
that
mr.
roitman
has
been
making.
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
i
think
that
there
you
would
have
an
issue
that
would
probably
have
to
be
remanded
to
the
board
because
as
the
board
found
the
facts
here,
this
ten-day
provision
was
not
something
first
of
all
that
had
anything
to
do
with
resigning
from
the
union.
it
was
a
combination
of
membership
and
check-off
clause.
the
trail
examiner
found
that
the
ten-day
provision
related
only
to
the
check-off
provision,
not
to
the
resignation
from
union
membership.
he
further
found
that
there
was
no
evidence
in
the
record
that
showed
that
the
employees
were
made
aware
that
this
was
the
way
that
you
had
to
resign
from
the
union.
the
court
of
appeals
sustained
that
finding.
we
submit
that
it
is
supported
by
a
substantial
evidence
for
the
additional
reason,
as
justice
marshall
pointed
out
that
nowhere
in
the
letters
that
were
sent
to
the
employees,
as
to
--
has
any
mention
made
of
the
fact
that
the
resignation
was
improper
because
it
didn't
comply
with
the
ten-day
rule.
thank
you.
