come,
you
say
that
it
was
a
severe
step
to
have
resigned
from
union?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
adverse
consequences
flow
to
these
particular
union
members
as
it
was
a
result
of
their
resignations
in
this
case?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
if
the
union
had
governed
a
similar
contract
to
the
one
which
had
expired
at
the
conclusion
of
the
strike,
could
it
have
prevented
these
man
from
being
reemployed?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
roitman,
the
court
of
appeals
apparently
and
the
trial
examiner
concluded,
perhaps
as
you
suggested
that
there
was
no
evidence
that
the
employees
knew
of
the
union's
practice
or
that
they
consented
to
it.
your
position
is
that
not
withstanding
that
conclusion,
this
was
something
that
was
up
to
the
union
and
it
didn't
make
any
difference
if
the
employees
knew
about
it
or
consented
to
it.
is
that
right?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
are
you
confessing
that
this
factual
conclusion
under
the
trial
examiner
that
was
upheld
by
the
court
of
appeals?
