mr.
harold
roitman
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
there
are
several
points
that
i
think
there
is
some
emphasis
in
analyzing
this
case.
first
of
all,
i
think,
it
should
be
pointed
out
that
in
this
case
the
board
is
now
seeking
to
have
the,
what
is
an
already
rendered
decision
of
the
state
court
of
new
hampshire
reversed.
in
this
case,
the
union
sought
enforcement
of
the
fines
and
sought
collection
of
other
contract
remedies
that
it
had
against
these
31
individuals
in
the
new
hampshire
court
and
a
motion
to
dismiss
that
action
was
filed
and
after
a
hearing,
there
was
a
ruling
by
mr.
justice
flynn
of
the
new
hampshire
superior
court
denying
the
motion
to
dismiss
and
accepting
a
sitting
jurisdiction
for
the
new
hampshire
court
for
the
determination
of
these
membership
issues
acting
as
the
opinion
points
out
and
i
have
attached
the
opinion
as
a
slip
to
the
brief
of
the
respondent.
the
judge
pointed
out
that
the
new
hampshire
court
was
acting
in
a
federally
unentered
enclaved
mentioned
by
this
court
in
the
scofield
case
and
in
the
earlier
decision
of
machinists
against
gonzales
where
you
would
recall
the
state
court's
ruling
that
the
union
had
improperly
expelled
and
an
individual
was
held
to
be
a
matter
for
decision
of
the
state
court,
and
not
a
matter
reserved
to
board
under
the
national
labor
relations
act.
secondly,
the
board
now
seeks
of
course
to
have
that
decision
of
the
new
hampshire
court
reversed
without
in
any
way
proceeding
against
the
decision
in
new
hampshire
by
a
way
of
federal
court
injunction
or
otherwise.
secondly,
it
seems
to
me
that
we
have
here
three
distinct
classes
of
members
that
gets
somewhat
lost
in
the
intricacy
of
the
case,
but
there
were
some
160
odd
employees
of
this
company.
three
or
four
of
the
employees
at
all
times
elected
to
act
pursuant
to
their
section
7
right
not
to
join
the
union
and
not
to
engage
in
concerted
activities.t
hose
employees
never
joined
the
union,
never
participated
in
union
affairs.
they
refused
to
join
in
the
strike
and
in
fact,
it
show
--
the
record
shows
that
they
continued
to
work
all
during
the
lengthy
strike
that
occurred
passing
to
and
follow
from
the
picket
line.
and
there
is
of
course
nothing
in
the
record
which
in
anyway
indicates
that
any
of
their
section
7
rights
to
refrain
were
in
anyway
impinged
upon
by
the
actions
of
the
union.
on
the
contrary,
those
rights
were
scrupulously
observed
by
the
union
and
these
people,
we
say
comes
squarely
within
the
section
7
rights
and
don't
come
within
the
special
proviso
of
section
81
which
gives
the
union
the
right
to
act
in
these
situations
and
making
membership
rules.
those
employees
would
carefully
have
their
rights
carefully
preserved
under
section
7.
now
it's
our
position
that
with
respect
to
the
other
160
employees,
they
were
all
mature
men
who
voluntarily
elected
to
join
the
union.
there
was
no
pressure
of
a
union
shop
or
any
other
outward
pressure
with
respect
to
their
jobs
which
would
compel
them
to
join
the
union.
they
freely
elected
to
join
the
union
on
their
own
and
then
as
the
contract
that
was
about
to
expire,
they
met
in
a
democratic
meeting
and
voted
to
engage
in
the
strike
as
a
new
contract
could
not
be
reached
with
the
company.
now
that
vote
for
strike
was
part
of
the
democratic
process
and
a
part
of
the
union's
legislative
activities
which
this
court
referred
to
in
the
above
--
in
the
allis-chalmers
case
as
part
of
the
national
labor
policy.
but
these
individuals
and
the
31
individuals
from
the
board
seeks
to
protect
in
their
strikebreaking
activities
in
this
case,
all
of
these
employees,
first
of
all
met
and
voted
to
engage
in
the
strike.
secondly
--
mr.
harold
roitman
yes,
our
position
with
respect
to
them
is
that
there
was
an
established
union
procedure,
now
they
are
not
spelled
out
in
the
constitution,
but
there
was
an
established
union
procedure
set
forth
in
the
membership
application
card
and
the
check-off
authorization
record,
under
which
an
employee
was
free
to
resign
his
membership
in
the
ten-day
period
following
the
termination
of
the
contract,
and
that
that
was
an
appropriate
time
for
any
employee
who
did
not
want
to
participate
in
the
concerted
activity
of
the
strike
to
resign.
as
the
union
pointed
out
that
there
had
been
an
established
practice
and
in
fact
one
of
the
31
members
whom
the
board
is
seeking
to
protect
here,
his
name
was
hassan
johnson,
he
was
an
employee
who
had
joined
the
union
after
spending
sometime
in
the
employment
of
the
company.
then
he
had
decided
to
resign
from
the
union.
his
resignation
had
been
timely
filed
at
a
previous
contract
termination
and
was
accepted
by
the
union.
then
he
changed
his
mind
again
and
reapplied
for
admission
to
the
union
and
now
after
many
months
of
the
strike,
he
resigned
again
for
the
second
time
and
the
union
at
all
times
has
taken
a
position
that
those
second
resignations
were
untimely,
but
they
would
have
been
timely,
had
they
been
filed
at
the
conclusion
of
the
contract
and
at
the
inception
of
the
strike
in
that
ten-day
period.
mr.
harold
roitman
well,
it's
the
union's
position
with
respect
to
that
position
that
under
section
8
(b)
(1),
the
union
is
the
appropriate
party
to
determine
what
its
rules
are
with
respect
to
retention
of
membership.
now
it's
true
that
the
union
did
not
spell
out
explicitly
in
the
contract,
in
the
constitution,
that
there
was
this
escape
period,
but
the
union
did
establish
and
that's
documented
in
the
testimony
that
it
honored
as
a
matter
of
practice
any
resignation
that
was
submitted
during
this
period.
and
the
application
for
membership
card
of
course
contained
this
ten-day
escape
period
immediately
above
the
signature
of
every
member
of
the
union.
every
member
who
applied
the
membership
in
the
union
signed
one
of
the
cards
for
membership
application
which
contained
within
it
the
recitation
after
the
application
could
be
withdrawn
during
this
ten-day
period.
mr.
harold
roitman
yes,
that's
always
been
our
position
throughout
this
case.
we
argued
that
point
before
the
trial
examiner.
it's
mentioned
again
in
the
court
of
appeals'
decision.
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
attack
that
particular
phase
of
our
argument.
it
decided
the
case
on
the
contract
argument
rather
than
this
membership
argument,
but
i
would
say
that
it
is
still
the
position
of
the
union
and
always
has
been
that
the
union
has
the
right
under
8
(b)
(1)
to
determine
its
rules
with
respect
to
retention.
this
was
the
rule
that
the
union
put
forth
and
the
union
is
the
proper
party
to
determine
any
ambiguity
in
those
rules,
not
the
trial
examiner
or
some
party
outside
the
union.
mr.
harold
roitman
we
just
say
that
that
act
puts
the
union
in
the
position
of
being
the
determiner
of
those.
mr.
harold
roitman
no,
the
union
--
mr.
harold
roitman
--
membership
is
a
contract
of
membership.
mr.
harold
roitman
yes,
i
think
so.
i
think
this
was
in
fact
the
union
rule
which
was
part
of
the
contract
of
membership
which
any
member
could
enforce.
i
think
he
could
absolutely
enforce
his
rights
to
resign
at
that
time.
we
would
point
out
also
that
the
construction
given
that
in
particular
aspect
of
the
case
is
that,
apparently
the
board
will
allow
an
individual
to
resign
at
any
time
regardless
of
this
limitation
which
the
union
says
is
there.
but
if
the
board
--
its
position
is
taken
and
you
say
that
a
member
can
resign
at
any
time
during
the
course
of
the
contract,
it
would
appear
that
he
would
continue
to
pay
dues
until
this
escape
period
for
the
payment
of
his
dues
applied,
and
you
have
the
incongruous
result
of
a
individual
continuing
to
pay
dues
to
an
organization
of
which
he
is
no
longer
a
member.
mr.
harold
roitman
yes,
i
think
it
is,
but
i
think
the
union's
construction
that
two
things
just
opposed
the
(inaudible)
mr.
harold
roitman
the
court
in
its
decision
merely
stated
that,
that
was
one
of
the
issues
that
the
court
would
take
after
it
heard
the
case.
mr.
harold
roitman
the
new
hampshire
court.
judge
flynn's
decision
again
which
is
appended
to
the
back
indicates
that
the
question
of
resignation
would
be
one
for
the
court
that
side
on
the
merits.
mr.
harold
roitman
well,
i
think
this
court
has
said
in
effect
in
the
gonzales
case,
that
that
is
the
kind
of
an
issue
that
the
federal
government
has
not
entered
into
and
therefore
it
is
a
matter
for
the
state
court
to
determine?
mr.
harold
roitman
well,
we
say
on
the
face
of
that
â€“
on
the
face
of
evidence
that
when
they
signed
the
application
card,
this
provision
was
right
in
front
of
them,
that
was
certainly
some
indication
of
knowledge
that
certainly
in
the
case
of
johnson
whom
i
mentioned
previously,
he
knew
about
it
because
he
had
resigned
at
the
appropriate
time,
had
his
resignation
accepted
and
chose
to
reapply
for
readmission.
mr.
harold
roitman
well,
it's
our
position
that
basically
yes
that
the
union
does
have
the
right
to
make
that
determination.
i
don't
think
the
issue
is
central
to
the
upholding
of
the
court
below.
it's
just
another
facet
that
can
be
used
to
uphold
the
final
result
here,
which
is
that
there
was
the
union's
position
that
these
were
not
accepted
resignations
at
the
time
they
were
made,
and
therefore
that
the
people
were
still
barred.
the
court
of
appeals
went
across
on
the
other
ground
that
this
was
a
contract
which
it
bound
the
--
(inaudible)
we
agree
with
that.
mr.
harold
roitman
well,
then
i
think,
you
have
perhaps
back
in
the
situation
that
this
is
a
voluntary
association
and
that
absent
restrictions,
the
voluntary
association
can
be
terminated
by
either
party
at
any
time
as
a
matter
of
voluntary
right
of
anybody
to
continue
the
association.
mr.
harold
roitman
no,
we
say
that
that
is
a
part
of
the
membership
contract
commitment
to
be
bound
by
that
state
of
affairs.
mr.
harold
roitman
well
i
suppose
as
you
can
always
stretch
the
elastic
till
it
breaks,
but
our
basic
position
would
be
that
the
union
that
has
the
right
and
again
the
proviso
of
section
8
(b)
(1)
to
effectuate
a
rule
with
respect
to
retention
of
membership
and
i
suppose
it
can
be
a
hash
rule
as
well
a
liberal
rule.
there
is
nothing
in
the
act
which
in
anyway
indicates
that.
i
would
say
in
that
point
that
--
mr.
harold
roitman
well,
no
days
is
just
a
saying
that
they
can
be
no
escape
from
membership.
mr.
harold
roitman
well,
that
is
--
it's
not
an
impossible
position
when
we
formed
a
more
union,
there
was
no
escape
provision
into
it.[laughter]
mr.
harold
roitman
yes,
they
would.
each
of
the
â€“
well
--
mr.
harold
roitman
each
of
the
employees
who
resigned,
the
first
two
were
sent
their
letters
by
the
head
of
the
granite
state
joint
board
and
it
was
called
to
their
attention
that
their
resignation
would
not
be
considered
effective
and
that
the
fine
would
be
imposed
against
them
and
later
on
in
the
record
after
the
company
--
mr.
harold
roitman
yes,
page
79,
your
honor.
well,
no.
page
is
79,
it's
the
letter.
mr.
harold
roitman
yes
that's
correct.
there
are
two
letters
set
forth,
one
which
has
a
ps
on
it
and
the
other
one
does
not.
page
34,
and
page
35,
and
page
36
indicate
--
mr.
harold
roitman
that
is
not
spelled
out
in
the
letter.
mr.
harold
roitman
it's
spelled
out
--
well,
the
evidence
with
respect
to
that
appears
in
connection
of
the
examination
of
mr.
(inaudible)
at
the
first
case.
i
think
it's
about
page
20
or
21.
mr.
harold
roitman
well
it
was
--
in
the
decision
of
the
trial
examiner,
the
first
decision
in
the
case,
he
sets
forth
some
of
the
union's
arguments
which
he
deals
with,
and
that
is
one
of
them
that
he
mentions.
the
point
that
was
brought
out
i
think
by
my
brother
in
his
examination
was
the
board
had
considered
this
type
of
issue,
the
ten-day
escape
period
in
connection
with
automobile
worker's
union
in
the
case
that
went
up
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
first
circuit,
it's
called
the
paulding
case
which
is
referred
to
in
the
briefs.
in
that
case,
the
automobile
workers
did
have
a
provision
on
the
constitution
which
allowed
resignations
only
in
that
ten-day
period.
the
board
held
that
it
did
not
apply
but
the
court
of
appeals
reversed
the
board
in
that
case
and
it
was
never
--
there
was
petition
for
certiorari,
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
was
accepted,
that's
at
320
federal
and
it's
referred
to
several
cases
in
the
several
instances
--
mr.
harold
roitman
no,
that's
right.
mr.
harold
roitman
no,
nobody
raised
that
question.
the
union
always
took
the
position
that
it
had
a
right
to
fine
these
individuals
on
the
basis
of
their
strike
vote,
on
the
basis
of
their
participation
in
the
vote
for
the
fine
and
in
the
fact
that
their
resignations
were
defective,
all
three
of
these
things
were
part
of
the
union's
position.
mr.
harold
roitman
no,
i
don't
think
so.
these
resignations
came
out
within
any
stretch
of
a
ten-day
period,
but
months
and
months
after
the
strike
had
not
only
started,
but
after
these
31
individuals
had
not
only
voted
for
the
strike,
but
had
actively
participated
in
the
strike.
these
employees
all
went
on
strike,
these
31
employees
all
participated
in
the
picketing.
they
all
participated
or
most,
all
of
them
participated
in
the
decision
of
the
union
to
secure
group
health
insurance
for
the
strikers,
they
participated
in
the
union
benefits
for
strikers.
they
were
actively
and
affirmatively
supporting
the
strike
for
many
months,
and
we
say
that
all
of
these
factors
are
part
of
the
reliance
item
which
entitles
the
union
to
fine
them
for
their
subsequent
strikebreaking
because
they
broke
their
contract,
the
contract
they
would
say
affirmatively
had
worked
to
promote
by
engaging
in
the
strikebreaking
and
i
would
suggest
that
--
mr.
harold
roitman
you
will
find
it
in
the
original
application,
petition
for
certiorari
where
the
decision
of
the
trial
examiner
is
set
forth.
he
sets
it
forth
in
his
first
opinion
and
i
think
it
is
also
set
forth
in
the
record
at
page
34,
your
honor.
mr.
harold
roitman
this
is
--
the
last
paragraph
there
it
says
that
the
authorization
shall
remain
in
effect
unless
i
revoke
it
within
10-days.
mr.
harold
roitman
each
individual
signed
that,
as
you
notice
right
underneath
the
restitution,
the
matter
is
also
referred
to
in
the
trail
examiner
genesis'
(ph)
opinion
and
i
think
he
sets
forth
a
copy
of
the
--
yes,
check-off
in
the
the
membership
application
cards
in
his
opinion.
mr.
harold
roitman
yes,
it's
--
i
think
that's
the
central
position
that
we
take.
that
is
when
the
union
members
vote
to
go
out
on
strike,
they
know
they
are
engaging
in
a
serious
economic
confrontation
that
can
last
for
an
in-determinant
period
and
they
obligate
themselves
to
see
that
enterprise
through
till
its
termination.
it's
is
termination
i
might
say,
it
might
come
either
because
the
exercise
of
the
economic
forces
on
both
of
the
parties
gets
them
into
a
compromised
position,
or
one
of
the
other
side
yields
sufficiently
to
arrive
at
an
accommodation
or
as
in
the
case
here,
the
union
finally
votes
to
abandon
or
discontinue
a
strike,
that's
wasn't
in
the
record
here,
but
ultimately
that's
what
happened.
mr.
harold
roitman
oh
yes,
there
were
constant
meetings
where
the
officers
reported
back
to
the
membership
on
the
status
of
negotiations
and
the
situation
once
the
union
was
in
where
they
voted
to
undertake
items,
for
example
like
the
insurance
matter
which
i
referred
to
a
moment
ago.
that
wasn't
spelled
out
very
carefully
in
the
record,
but
i
think
there
is,
perhaps
a
brief
reference
to
it
in
some
of
the
letters
of
resignation.
one
or
more
of
the
members
complained
that
he
didn't
like
the
way
one
of
those
meetings
would
run,
but
there
were
frequent
meetings
at
which
there
was
ample
opportunity
for
these
31
employees
to
exercise
their
democratic
right
within
the
union
to
persuade
any
of
the
others
to
the
courts.
and
we
say
that
that's
the
position
that
this
court
left
the
parties
in,
in
the
scofield
case,
namely
that
the
union
and
the
national
labor
policy
is
one
that
favors
the
democratic
operation
of
union
affairs,
that
the
union
has
these
legislative
powers
with
respect
to
collective
bargaining,
that
when
they
democratically
vote
to
undertake
a
strike,
the
only
thing
that
remains
open
after
that
is
the
settlement
of
the
strike
or
the
democratic
--
use
of
the
democratic
practice
to
change
the
position.
in
the
scofield
quotation
that's
relied
on
by
the
board,
if
you
back
up
a
few
sentences,
i
think
that's
made
clear
by
the
court
that
the
court
points
out
that
it's
the
right
of
an
individual
to
exert
his
democratic
influence
or
his
influence
on
the
body
and
had
been
--
have
his
minority
position,
if
you
will,
change
to
a
majority
position
by
persuasion,
and
that
position
is
the
one
that
is
in
accord
with
the
legislative
policy
under
the
act
and
is
in
effect
the
only
way
that
the
contract
commitment
can
be
changed
by
mutual
agreement.
we
point
that
the
board
itself
in
dealing
with
associations,
for
example,
that
are
put
together
for
the
purpose
of
mutual
collective
bargaining,
lays
down
the
rule
that
you
can
only
withdraw
from
such
an
association
prior
to
the
time
that
the
association
engages
in
collective
bargaining,
that
a
subsequent
withdrawal
must
be
by
mutual
consent
rather
than
by
an
individual
having
an
individual
veto
power.
if
you
allow
the
board's
position
of
course,
each
individual
has
a
right
to
veto
the
legislative
examination
of
the
majority,
and
you
have
not
a
democratic
proposition
but
(inaudible)
within
the
union
which
allows
each
member
to
be
an
individual
breaker
of
the
joint
commitment,
and
there
again,
we
pointed
out
situations,
where
in
the
past,
the
court
has
held
that
an
individual
waives
his
right
to
engage
in
strikes
when
the
union
votes
to
accept
a
contract
against
striking.
there
are
various
other
situations
that
we
have
referred
to
in
the
brief,
where
for
one
reason
or
another,
the
individual
member's
right
to
either
engage
in
a
strike
or
not
to
engage
in
a
strike
is
affected
by
the
majority
determination
of
the
union
in
accordance
with
the
national
labor
policy.
mr.
harold
roitman
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
there
are
several
points
that
i
think
there
is
some
emphasis
in
analyzing
this
case.
first
of
all,
i
think,
it
should
be
pointed
out
that
in
this
case
the
board
is
now
seeking
to
have
the,
what
is
an
already
rendered
decision
of
the
state
court
of
new
hampshire
reversed.
in
this
case,
the
union
sought
enforcement
of
the
fines
and
sought
collection
of
other
contract
remedies
that
it
had
against
these
31
individuals
in
the
new
hampshire
court
and
a
motion
to
dismiss
that
action
was
filed
and
after
a
hearing,
there
was
a
ruling
by
mr.
justice
flynn
of
the
new
hampshire
superior
court
denying
the
motion
to
dismiss
and
accepting
a
sitting
jurisdiction
for
the
new
hampshire
court
for
the
determination
of
these
membership
issues
acting
as
the
opinion
points
out
and
i
have
attached
the
opinion
as
a
slip
to
the
brief
of
the
respondent.
the
judge
pointed
out
that
the
new
hampshire
court
was
acting
in
a
federally
unentered
enclaved
mentioned
by
this
court
in
the
scofield
case
and
in
the
earlier
decision
of
machinists
against
gonzales
where
you
would
recall
the
state
court's
ruling
that
the
union
had
improperly
expelled
and
an
individual
was
held
to
be
a
matter
for
decision
of
the
state
court,
and
not
a
matter
reserved
to
board
under
the
national
labor
relations
act.
secondly,
the
board
now
seeks
of
course
to
have
that
decision
of
the
new
hampshire
court
reversed
without
in
any
way
proceeding
against
the
decision
in
new
hampshire
by
a
way
of
federal
court
injunction
or
otherwise.
secondly,
it
seems
to
me
that
we
have
here
three
distinct
classes
of
members
that
gets
somewhat
lost
in
the
intricacy
of
the
case,
but
there
were
some
160
odd
employees
of
this
company.
three
or
four
of
the
employees
at
all
times
elected
to
act
pursuant
to
their
section
7
right
not
to
join
the
union
and
not
to
engage
in
concerted
activities.t
hose
employees
never
joined
the
union,
never
participated
in
union
affairs.
they
refused
to
join
in
the
strike
and
in
fact,
it
show
--
the
record
shows
that
they
continued
to
work
all
during
the
lengthy
strike
that
occurred
passing
to
and
follow
from
the
picket
line.
and
there
is
of
course
nothing
in
the
record
which
in
anyway
indicates
that
any
of
their
section
7
rights
to
refrain
were
in
anyway
impinged
upon
by
the
actions
of
the
union.
on
the
contrary,
those
rights
were
scrupulously
observed
by
the
union
and
these
people,
we
say
comes
squarely
within
the
section
7
rights
and
don't
come
within
the
special
proviso
of
section
81
which
gives
the
union
the
right
to
act
in
these
situations
and
making
membership
rules.
those
employees
would
carefully
have
their
rights
carefully
preserved
under
section
7.
now
it's
our
position
that
with
respect
to
the
other
160
employees,
they
were
all
mature
men
who
voluntarily
elected
to
join
the
union.
there
was
no
pressure
of
a
union
shop
or
any
other
outward
pressure
with
respect
to
their
jobs
which
would
compel
them
to
join
the
union.
they
freely
elected
to
join
the
union
on
their
own
and
then
as
the
contract
that
was
about
to
expire,
they
met
in
a
democratic
meeting
and
voted
to
engage
in
the
strike
as
a
new
contract
could
not
be
reached
with
the
company.
now
that
vote
for
strike
was
part
of
the
democratic
process
and
a
part
of
the
union's
legislative
activities
which
this
court
referred
to
in
the
above
--
in
the
allis-chalmers
case
as
part
of
the
national
labor
policy.
but
these
individuals
and
the
31
individuals
from
the
board
seeks
to
protect
in
their
strikebreaking
activities
in
this
case,
all
of
these
employees,
first
of
all
met
and
voted
to
engage
in
the
strike.
secondly
--
mr.
harold
roitman
yes,
our
position
with
respect
to
them
is
that
there
was
an
established
union
procedure,
now
they
are
not
spelled
out
in
the
constitution,
but
there
was
an
established
union
procedure
set
forth
in
the
membership
application
card
and
the
check-off
authorization
record,
under
which
an
employee
was
free
to
resign
his
membership
in
the
ten-day
period
following
the
termination
of
the
contract,
and
that
that
was
an
appropriate
time
for
any
employee
who
did
not
want
to
participate
in
the
concerted
activity
of
the
strike
to
resign.
as
the
union
pointed
out
that
there
had
been
an
established
practice
and
in
fact
one
of
the
31
members
whom
the
board
is
seeking
to
protect
here,
his
name
was
hassan
johnson,
he
was
an
employee
who
had
joined
the
union
after
spending
sometime
in
the
employment
of
the
company.
then
he
had
decided
to
resign
from
the
union.
his
resignation
had
been
timely
filed
at
a
previous
contract
termination
and
was
accepted
by
the
union.
then
he
changed
his
mind
again
and
reapplied
for
admission
to
the
union
and
now
after
many
months
of
the
strike,
he
resigned
again
for
the
second
time
and
the
union
at
all
times
has
taken
a
position
that
those
second
resignations
were
untimely,
but
they
would
have
been
timely,
had
they
been
filed
at
the
conclusion
of
the
contract
and
at
the
inception
of
the
strike
in
that
ten-day
period.
mr.
harold
roitman
well,
it's
the
union's
position
with
respect
to
that
position
that
under
section
8
(b)
(1),
the
union
is
the
appropriate
party
to
determine
what
its
rules
are
with
respect
to
retention
of
membership.
now
it's
true
that
the
union
did
not
spell
out
explicitly
in
the
contract,
in
the
constitution,
that
there
was
this
escape
period,
but
the
union
did
establish
and
that's
documented
in
the
testimony
that
it
honored
as
a
matter
of
practice
any
resignation
that
was
submitted
during
this
period.
and
the
application
for
membership
card
of
course
contained
this
ten-day
escape
period
immediately
above
the
signature
of
every
member
of
the
union.
every
member
who
applied
the
membership
in
the
union
signed
one
of
the
cards
for
membership
application
which
contained
within
it
the
recitation
after
the
application
could
be
withdrawn
during
this
ten-day
period.
mr.
harold
roitman
yes,
that's
always
been
our
position
throughout
this
case.
we
argued
that
point
before
the
trial
examiner.
it's
mentioned
again
in
the
court
of
appeals'
decision.
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
attack
that
particular
phase
of
our
argument.
it
decided
the
case
on
the
contract
argument
rather
than
this
membership
argument,
but
i
would
say
that
it
is
still
the
position
of
the
union
and
always
has
been
that
the
union
has
the
right
under
8
(b)
(1)
to
determine
its
rules
with
respect
to
retention.
this
was
the
rule
that
the
union
put
forth
and
the
union
is
the
proper
party
to
determine
any
ambiguity
in
those
rules,
not
the
trial
examiner
or
some
party
outside
the
union.
mr.
harold
roitman
we
just
say
that
that
act
puts
the
union
in
the
position
of
being
the
determiner
of
those.
mr.
harold
roitman
no,
the
union
--
mr.
harold
roitman
--
membership
is
a
contract
of
membership.
mr.
harold
roitman
yes,
i
think
so.
i
think
this
was
in
fact
the
union
rule
which
was
part
of
the
contract
of
membership
which
any
member
could
enforce.
i
think
he
could
absolutely
enforce
his
rights
to
resign
at
that
time.
we
would
point
out
also
that
the
construction
given
that
in
particular
aspect
of
the
case
is
that,
apparently
the
board
will
allow
an
individual
to
resign
at
any
time
regardless
of
this
limitation
which
the
union
says
is
there.
but
if
the
board
--
its
position
is
taken
and
you
say
that
a
member
can
resign
at
any
time
during
the
course
of
the
contract,
it
would
appear
that
he
would
continue
to
pay
dues
until
this
escape
period
for
the
payment
of
his
dues
applied,
and
you
have
the
incongruous
result
of
a
individual
continuing
to
pay
dues
to
an
organization
of
which
he
is
no
longer
a
member.
mr.
harold
roitman
yes,
i
think
it
is,
but
i
think
the
union's
construction
that
two
things
just
opposed
the
(inaudible)
mr.
harold
roitman
the
court
in
its
decision
merely
stated
that,
that
was
one
of
the
issues
that
the
court
would
take
after
it
heard
the
case.
mr.
harold
roitman
the
new
hampshire
court.
judge
flynn's
decision
again
which
is
appended
to
the
back
indicates
that
the
question
of
resignation
would
be
one
for
the
court
that
side
on
the
merits.
mr.
harold
roitman
well,
i
think
this
court
has
said
in
effect
in
the
gonzales
case,
that
that
is
the
kind
of
an
issue
that
the
federal
government
has
not
entered
into
and
therefore
it
is
a
matter
for
the
state
court
to
determine?
mr.
harold
roitman
well,
we
say
on
the
face
of
that
â€“
on
the
face
of
evidence
that
when
they
signed
the
application
card,
this
provision
was
right
in
front
of
them,
that
was
certainly
some
indication
of
knowledge
that
certainly
in
the
case
of
johnson
whom
i
mentioned
previously,
he
knew
about
it
because
he
had
resigned
at
the
appropriate
time,
had
his
resignation
accepted
and
chose
to
reapply
for
readmission.
mr.
harold
roitman
well,
it's
our
position
that
basically
yes
that
the
union
does
have
the
right
to
make
that
determination.
i
don't
think
the
issue
is
central
to
the
upholding
of
the
court
below.
it's
just
another
facet
that
can
be
used
to
uphold
the
final
result
here,
which
is
that
there
was
the
union's
position
that
these
were
not
accepted
resignations
at
the
time
they
were
made,
and
therefore
that
the
people
were
still
barred.
the
court
of
appeals
went
across
on
the
other
ground
that
this
was
a
contract
which
it
bound
the
--
(inaudible)
we
agree
with
that.
mr.
harold
roitman
well,
then
i
think,
you
have
perhaps
back
in
the
situation
that
this
is
a
voluntary
association
and
that
absent
restrictions,
the
voluntary
association
can
be
terminated
by
either
party
at
any
time
as
a
matter
of
voluntary
right
of
anybody
to
continue
the
association.
mr.
harold
roitman
no,
we
say
that
that
is
a
part
of
the
membership
contract
commitment
to
be
bound
by
that
state
of
affairs.
mr.
harold
roitman
well
i
suppose
as
you
can
always
stretch
the
elastic
till
it
breaks,
but
our
basic
position
would
be
that
the
union
that
has
the
right
and
again
the
proviso
of
section
8
(b)
(1)
to
effectuate
a
rule
with
respect
to
retention
of
membership
and
i
suppose
it
can
be
a
hash
rule
as
well
a
liberal
rule.
there
is
nothing
in
the
act
which
in
anyway
indicates
that.
i
would
say
in
that
point
that
--
mr.
harold
roitman
well,
no
days
is
just
a
saying
that
they
can
be
no
escape
from
membership.
mr.
harold
roitman
well,
that
is
--
it's
not
an
impossible
position
when
we
formed
a
more
union,
there
was
no
escape
provision
into
it.[laughter]
mr.
harold
roitman
yes,
they
would.
each
of
the
â€“
well
--
mr.
harold
roitman
each
of
the
employees
who
resigned,
the
first
two
were
sent
their
letters
by
the
head
of
the
granite
state
joint
board
and
it
was
called
to
their
attention
that
their
resignation
would
not
be
considered
effective
and
that
the
fine
would
be
imposed
against
them
and
later
on
in
the
record
after
the
company
--
mr.
harold
roitman
yes,
page
79,
your
honor.
well,
no.
page
is
79,
it's
the
letter.
mr.
harold
roitman
yes
that's
correct.
there
are
two
letters
set
forth,
one
which
has
a
ps
on
it
and
the
other
one
does
not.
page
34,
and
page
35,
and
page
36
indicate
--
mr.
harold
roitman
that
is
not
spelled
out
in
the
letter.
mr.
harold
roitman
it's
spelled
out
--
well,
the
evidence
with
respect
to
that
appears
in
connection
of
the
examination
of
mr.
(inaudible)
at
the
first
case.
i
think
it's
about
page
20
or
21.
mr.
harold
roitman
well
it
was
--
in
the
decision
of
the
trial
examiner,
the
first
decision
in
the
case,
he
sets
forth
some
of
the
union's
arguments
which
he
deals
with,
and
that
is
one
of
them
that
he
mentions.
the
point
that
was
brought
out
i
think
by
my
brother
in
his
examination
was
the
board
had
considered
this
type
of
issue,
the
ten-day
escape
period
in
connection
with
automobile
worker's
union
in
the
case
that
went
up
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
first
circuit,
it's
called
the
paulding
case
which
is
referred
to
in
the
briefs.
in
that
case,
the
automobile
workers
did
have
a
provision
on
the
constitution
which
allowed
resignations
only
in
that
ten-day
period.
the
board
held
that
it
did
not
apply
but
the
court
of
appeals
reversed
the
board
in
that
case
and
it
was
never
--
there
was
petition
for
certiorari,
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
was
accepted,
that's
at
320
federal
and
it's
referred
to
several
cases
in
the
several
instances
--
mr.
harold
roitman
no,
that's
right.
mr.
harold
roitman
no,
nobody
raised
that
question.
the
union
always
took
the
position
that
it
had
a
right
to
fine
these
individuals
on
the
basis
of
their
strike
vote,
on
the
basis
of
their
participation
in
the
vote
for
the
fine
and
in
the
fact
that
their
resignations
were
defective,
all
three
of
these
things
were
part
of
the
union's
position.
mr.
harold
roitman
no,
i
don't
think
so.
these
resignations
came
out
within
any
stretch
of
a
ten-day
period,
but
months
and
months
after
the
strike
had
not
only
started,
but
after
these
31
individuals
had
not
only
voted
for
the
strike,
but
had
actively
participated
in
the
strike.
these
employees
all
went
on
strike,
these
31
employees
all
participated
in
the
picketing.
they
all
participated
or
most,
all
of
them
participated
in
the
decision
of
the
union
to
secure
group
health
insurance
for
the
strikers,
they
participated
in
the
union
benefits
for
strikers.
they
were
actively
and
affirmatively
supporting
the
strike
for
many
months,
and
we
say
that
all
of
these
factors
are
part
of
the
reliance
item
which
entitles
the
union
to
fine
them
for
their
subsequent
strikebreaking
because
they
broke
their
contract,
the
contract
they
would
say
affirmatively
had
worked
to
promote
by
engaging
in
the
strikebreaking
and
i
would
suggest
that
--
mr.
harold
roitman
you
will
find
it
in
the
original
application,
petition
for
certiorari
where
the
decision
of
the
trial
examiner
is
set
forth.
he
sets
it
forth
in
his
first
opinion
and
i
think
it
is
also
set
forth
in
the
record
at
page
34,
your
honor.
mr.
harold
roitman
this
is
--
the
last
paragraph
there
it
says
that
the
authorization
shall
remain
in
effect
unless
i
revoke
it
within
10-days.
mr.
harold
roitman
each
individual
signed
that,
as
you
notice
right
underneath
the
restitution,
the
matter
is
also
referred
to
in
the
trail
examiner
genesis'
(ph)
opinion
and
i
think
he
sets
forth
a
copy
of
the
--
yes,
check-off
in
the
the
membership
application
cards
in
his
opinion.
mr.
harold
roitman
yes,
it's
--
i
think
that's
the
central
position
that
we
take.
that
is
when
the
union
members
vote
to
go
out
on
strike,
they
know
they
are
engaging
in
a
serious
economic
confrontation
that
can
last
for
an
in-determinant
period
and
they
obligate
themselves
to
see
that
enterprise
through
till
its
termination.
it's
is
termination
i
might
say,
it
might
come
either
because
the
exercise
of
the
economic
forces
on
both
of
the
parties
gets
them
into
a
compromised
position,
or
one
of
the
other
side
yields
sufficiently
to
arrive
at
an
accommodation
or
as
in
the
case
here,
the
union
finally
votes
to
abandon
or
discontinue
a
strike,
that's
wasn't
in
the
record
here,
but
ultimately
that's
what
happened.
mr.
harold
roitman
oh
yes,
there
were
constant
meetings
where
the
officers
reported
back
to
the
membership
on
the
status
of
negotiations
and
the
situation
once
the
union
was
in
where
they
voted
to
undertake
items,
for
example
like
the
insurance
matter
which
i
referred
to
a
moment
ago.
that
wasn't
spelled
out
very
carefully
in
the
record,
but
i
think
there
is,
perhaps
a
brief
reference
to
it
in
some
of
the
letters
of
resignation.
one
or
more
of
the
members
complained
that
he
didn't
like
the
way
one
of
those
meetings
would
run,
but
there
were
frequent
meetings
at
which
there
was
ample
opportunity
for
these
31
employees
to
exercise
their
democratic
right
within
the
union
to
persuade
any
of
the
others
to
the
courts.
and
we
say
that
that's
the
position
that
this
court
left
the
parties
in,
in
the
scofield
case,
namely
that
the
union
and
the
national
labor
policy
is
one
that
favors
the
democratic
operation
of
union
affairs,
that
the
union
has
these
legislative
powers
with
respect
to
collective
bargaining,
that
when
they
democratically
vote
to
undertake
a
strike,
the
only
thing
that
remains
open
after
that
is
the
settlement
of
the
strike
or
the
democratic
--
use
of
the
democratic
practice
to
change
the
position.
in
the
scofield
quotation
that's
relied
on
by
the
board,
if
you
back
up
a
few
sentences,
i
think
that's
made
clear
by
the
court
that
the
court
points
out
that
it's
the
right
of
an
individual
to
exert
his
democratic
influence
or
his
influence
on
the
body
and
had
been
--
have
his
minority
position,
if
you
will,
change
to
a
majority
position
by
persuasion,
and
that
position
is
the
one
that
is
in
accord
with
the
legislative
policy
under
the
act
and
is
in
effect
the
only
way
that
the
contract
commitment
can
be
changed
by
mutual
agreement.
we
point
that
the
board
itself
in
dealing
with
associations,
for
example,
that
are
put
together
for
the
purpose
of
mutual
collective
bargaining,
lays
down
the
rule
that
you
can
only
withdraw
from
such
an
association
prior
to
the
time
that
the
association
engages
in
collective
bargaining,
that
a
subsequent
withdrawal
must
be
by
mutual
consent
rather
than
by
an
individual
having
an
individual
veto
power.
if
you
allow
the
board's
position
of
course,
each
individual
has
a
right
to
veto
the
legislative
examination
of
the
majority,
and
you
have
not
a
democratic
proposition
but
(inaudible)
within
the
union
which
allows
each
member
to
be
an
individual
breaker
of
the
joint
commitment,
and
there
again,
we
pointed
out
situations,
where
in
the
past,
the
court
has
held
that
an
individual
waives
his
right
to
engage
in
strikes
when
the
union
votes
to
accept
a
contract
against
striking.
there
are
various
other
situations
that
we
have
referred
to
in
the
brief,
where
for
one
reason
or
another,
the
individual
member's
right
to
either
engage
in
a
strike
or
not
to
engage
in
a
strike
is
affected
by
the
majority
determination
of
the
union
in
accordance
with
the
national
labor
policy.
