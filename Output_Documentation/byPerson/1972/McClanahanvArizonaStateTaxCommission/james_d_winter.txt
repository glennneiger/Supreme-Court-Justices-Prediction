mr.
james
d.
winter
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
issue
on
this
case
is
whether
or
not
the
state
of
arizona
can
impose
its
income
tax
on
income
of
a
navajo
indian
earned
on
the
navajo
indian
reservation
that
particular
indian
residing
on
the
reservation.
now,
there
are
a
number
of
cases
involving
the
question
of
federal
income
tax
liability
of
indians
residing
on
reservations.
and
those
cases
have
been
decided
in
favor
of
their
tax
liability.
in
the
oklahoma
tax
commission
case,
although
that
was
an
inheritance
tax
case,
nevertheless
the
government
having
the
decision
referred
to
the
income
tax
cases
and
state
and
federal
income
tax
liability
were
there
equated.
after
--
there
is
the
leahy
decision
involving
the
oklahoma
income
tax.
this
case
was
decided
in
the
1930s.
and
in
many
ways,
it
is
similar
to
the
situation
that
we
have
today
although
the
opinion
is
short.
the
briefs
throw
conservatively
more
light
on
the
subject.
the
all
state
indians
had
a
reservation.
they
had
a
treaty
with
the
federal
government.
they
had
a
tribal
government.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
united
states
congress
had
passed
the
law
providing
for
state
probate
jurisdiction
in
regard
to
the
osage
before
this
case
was
decided,
which
is
an
indication
that
they
had
a
viable
tribal
government.
now
in
that
particular
case,
the
court
upheld
the
state
taxation.
it
appeared
to
the
court
from
the
opinion
that
since
the
indians
received
the
income
and
were
free
to
dispose
of
it
as
they
wished
that
there
was
no
reason
why
they
shouldn’t
be
taxed
on
it.
mr.
james
d.
winter
i
beg
your
pardon,
mr.
justice?
mr.
james
d.
winter
in
the
leahy
case,
the
income
came
from
restricted
mineral
property.
this
was
property
that
was
owned
by
the
tribe,
the
osage
tribe.
mr.
james
d.
winter
no.
that
is
something
that
i
am
not
clear
about
because
i
wasn’t
able
to
find
anything
in
the
record
that
indicated
whether
it
was
on
or
off
the
reservation.
there
are
some
state
court
cases
now.
four
of
them
that
have
raised
this,
rather
five
of
them,
six
i
am
counting
this
case
in
which
the
question
is
raised
and
all
but
one
of
them,
the
brun
case
from
minnesota
were
decided
in
favor
of
tax
liability.
the
gahate
case
from
new
mexico
is
the
one
that
is
probably
most
like
ours.
it
involved
a
navajo
indian.
the
only
difference
between
the
gahate
case
and
ours
is
that
i
can
see
is
that
in
the
gahate
case,
counsel
for
the
navajo
stipulated
that
imposition
of
the
income
tax
by
the
state
of
new
mexico
did
not
infringe
upon
the
sovereignty
of
the
navajo
tribe.
the
counsel
was
unwilling
to
stipulate
that
in
our
case.
now,
in
the
brun
case,
the
court
did
apply
the
williams
versus
lee
test
absentee
--
the
test
of
validity
of
state
action
on
indian
reservation
is
whether
or
not
it
infringes
on
any
rights
granted
under
any
act
of
congress
or
upon
the
indian
right
of
self-government.
the
court
in
the
brun
case
concluded
that
the
imposition
of
the
minnesota
tax
infringed
on
the
right
of
self-government.
there
are
some
--
they
simply
assumed
that
it
did
apparently
because
of
the
economic
impact
of
the
tax.
in
other
words,
if
the
indians
had
to
pay
this
tax
to
the
state
of
minnesota
then
there
would
be
less
able
to
pay
a
tax
i
supposed
if
the
tribe
should
levy
a
tax.
at
any
rate,
this
decision
certainly
in
this
respect
is
in
conflict
with
decisions
in
cases
like
graves
versus
new
york
and
helvering
versus
gerhardt
which
involved
the
questions
of
whether
or
not
state
employees
had
to
pay
federal
income
taxes
and
whether
or
not
federal
employees
had
to
pay
state
income
taxes.
in
those
cases,
while
the
court
concluded
that
the
fact
that
an
employee
of
a
state
government
or
a
federal
government
had
to
pay
income
taxes
to
the
other
government
did
not
impose
any
sort
of
substantial
burden
on
that
other
government.
so,
we
have
a
test
--
a
practical
test
of
substantial
interference
with
the
essential
governmental
function.
the
court
in
the
brun
case
obviously
did
not
apply
that
test.
now,
one
other
factors
involved
in
this
connection,
this
tax
has
been
imposed
by
the
state
of
arizona
since
1957
at
least
when
attorney
general
opinion
on
the
state
of
arizona
was
rendered
on
that
subject
and
if
this
tax
really
infringed
upon
the
self-government
of
the
navajo
tribe.
it
would
seem
that
we
should
have
heard
about
it
before
now.
now,
in
--
mr.
james
d.
winter
yes,
your
honor?
mr.
james
d.
winter
if
the
tax
is
not
paid,
well
then
the
state
would
attempt
to
collect
it.
now,
on
a
question
of
whether
or
not
the
state
could
levy
on
the
navajo
reservation,
i
think
that
the
state
probably
would
not
attempt
to
do
that.
because
there
is
a
--
mr.
james
d.
winter
on
a
navajo
reservation?
mr.
james
d.
winter
i
don’t
know,
your
honor
but
i
am
inclined
to
think
that
the
state
could
not.
but
i
don’t
know.
mr.
james
d.
winter
under
our
enabling
act
we
cannot
tax
real
property
on
the
reservation.
it
is
specifically
excluded,
your
honor
from
property
taxation.
mr.
james
d.
winter
on
indians
residing
on
the
indian
reservation?
mr.
james
d.
winter
well,
the
only
thing
that
i
can
think
of
is
that
if
it
came
outside
of
the
scope
of
the
warren
trading
post
case.
in
other
words,
the
indians
involved
were
not
indian
traders
and
they
were
selling
items
on
the
indian
reservation.
well,
then
i
would
think
that
they
would
be
subject
to
the
sales
tax.
mr.
james
d.
winter
according
to
figures
that
we
have,
the
--
it
would
be
between
$2
million
and
$3
million
that
the
state
has
collected
according
to
a
governor’s
study
that
was
just
completed
in
our
state.
mr.
james
d.
winter
yes,
your
honor.
the
income
tax
but
that’s
all
reservations
on
the
state
and
the
navajo
reservation,
of
course
has
most
of
the
indian
population
in
the
state
because
although
the
state
may
have
a
125,000
indians,
80,000
or
90,000
live
on
the
navajo
reservation.
now,
it’s
our
position
that
williams
versus
lee
which
was
cited
by
counsel
for
the
appellee
is
distinguished
both
from
this
case
because
it
did
involved
infringement
up
on
the
right
of
self-government
of
the
navajo
tribe.
that
case
involved
the
jurisdiction
of
the
courts
and
there
the
court
concluded
that
the
state
courts
did
not
have
a
jurisdiction
over
what
were
essentially
trouble
matters,
matter
relating
to
the
liability
of
a
navajo
resident
of
the
reservation
in
connection
with
a
transaction
entered
into
on
the
reservation
and
that
for
the
same
reasons
and
for
the
additional
reasons
that
a
procedural
point
was
involved,
we
think
that
the
kennerly
case
is
also
distinguishable.
now,
various
arguments
have
been
raised
by
the
appellants
that
there
was
expressed
congressional
authorization
was
required
in
order
for
the
state
laws
to
apply
on
the
reservation.
this
is
an
extremely
narrow
question
as
i
think
that
the
united
states
has
already
conceded
in
regards
to
the
khan
case.
state
laws
may
have
on
indian
reservations
to
third
persons.
now,
i
think
that
state
laws
as
a
practical
matter
do
apply
on
indian
reservations.
when
you’re
talking
about
certain
benefits
or
even
benefits
that
are
not
conferred
by
federal
statutes
or
by
contract
under
the
johnson-o’malley
act
and
i
am
talking
about
such
things
as
the
right
to
vote.
when
a
navajo
indian
votes
on
a
navajo
reservation
in
a
state
election,
he
does
not
vote
under
tribal
law
or
a
federal
law.
he
is
voting
under
state
law.
now,
the
case
of
kake
versus
egan
set
down
what
we
considered
the
rule
to
be
that
state
laws
do
apply
on
indian
reservations
with
two
exceptions.
if
they
do
not
infringe
upon
the
tribal
government
of
the
tribe
or
if
they
do
not
infringe
upon
any
rights
which
were
granted
by
an
act
of
congress.
this
is
certainly
in
line
with
what
this
court
has
held
before
in
surplus
trading
company
versus
cook.
i
believe,
it
was
indicated
to
the
effect
that
state
laws
have
restricted
application
on
indian
reservations.
meaning
that
they
do
have
application
and
i
think
by
restricted
application
what
the
court
was
referring
to
were
the
exceptions
such
as
the
indian
right
of
self-government.
and
these
laws
cannot
apply
if
they
are
in
conflict
with
federal
laws.
and
then
in
new
york
versus
martin
where
the
court
said
that
in
the
absence
of
treaty
obligations
are
federal
statute’s
state
laws
do
apply
indian
reservations.
now,
it
is
our
position
that
no
act
of
congress
prohibits
application
of
state
income
taxes
to
indians.
the
first
statute
that
comes
to
mind
in
this
connection
in
chronological
order
is
the
state
enabling
act
of
the
state
of
arizona.
and
because
there
has
been
considerable
confusion
about
the
language,
i
would
just
like
to
read
the
language
that
has
been
the
subject
of
dispute
in
this
connection,
“that
the
people
inhabiting
the
said
proposed
state
do
agree
and
declare
that
they
forever
disclaim
all
right
entitled
to
the
unappropriated
and
ungranted
public
lands
lying
within
the
boundaries
thereof
and
all
lands
lying
within
said
boundaries
owned
or
held
by
any
indian
or
indian
tribes.
the
right
or
title
to
which
it
shall
have
been
acquired
through
or
from
the
united
states
or
any
prior
sovereignty
and
that
until
the
title
of
such
indian
or
indian
tribes
shall
have
been
extinguished
the
same
shall
be
and
remain
subject
to
the
disposition
and
under
the
absolute
jurisdiction
and
control
of
the
congress
of
the
united
states.”
these
are
what
we
referred
to
as
disclaimer
in
the
absolute
jurisdiction
and
control
provisions.
now,
they
do
not
refer
to
indian
reservations
although
subsequently
in
the
enabling
act
the
congress
did
refer
to
indian
reservations.
but
they
refer
to
indian
lands
and
the
reason
for
that
distinction
as
was
pointed
out
in
the
draper
case
was
because
in
the
general
allotment
act
of
1887,
congress
provided
that
indians
living
off
of
reservations
could
obtain
some
unappropriated
public
lands
that
would
be
subject
to
the
same
restrictions
as
lands
that
were
obtained
under
allotments.
it
was
a
desire
of
congress
at
the
time
that
arizona
was
admitted
to
the
union
to
protect
the
rights
of
the
indians
in
these
lands.
and
this
enabling
act
is
like
that
of
many
other
states.
and
this
was
done,
this
language
was
used,
indian
lands
were
referred
to
for
that
reason.
there
was
no
ambiguity
at
all
in
doing
it
and
i
think
that
this
is
confirmed
by
a
number
of
state
court
decisions
on
the
subject,
as
well
as
the
more
recent
decision
of
this
court
in
kake
versus
egan.
now,
there
has
--
public
law
280
was
enacted
in
1953.
at
that
time,
the
policy
of
the
federal
government
was
to
get
out
of
the
indian
reservations
or
it
was
the
termination
policy
and
this
was
one
of
--
and
because
this
was
the
concern
at
that
time,
the
provisions
of
280
provided
for
state
assumption
of
jurisdiction.
now,
there
was
also
some
confusion
at
that
time
about
what
the
state
enabling
acts
meant.
this
confusion
has
indicated
in
a
letter
that
we
have
quoted
from
that
was
in
the
committee
reports.
it’s
in
our
brief
and
so
congress
acted
partly
to
clear
up
this
confusion.
they
wanted
to
provide
a
procedure
so
that
the
states
would
not
consider
these
enabling
acts
to
be
a
stumbling
block.
so
that
they
would
assume
for
measure
of
jurisdiction
so
that
the
federal
government
could
be
relieved
of
all
responsibility
for
as
soon
as
the
indians
were
ready
for
this.
public
law
280
did
not
deprive
the
states
of
any
jurisdiction
that
they
already
have.
now,
the
civil
rights
act
of
1968
amended
public
law
280
in
effect
to
require
tribal
consent
to
the
state
assumption
of
jurisdiction.
there
is
one
more
item
and
that
is
the
treaty
of
1868.
and
that
treaty
has
nothing
at
all
in
and
about
the
tax
liability
of
the
indians.
it
was
in
1871
that
the
government
decided
that
the
indians
were
an
internal
problem
that
there
would
be
no
more
treaties
with
the
indians
and
it
would
not
seem
fair
to
distinguish
between
the
navajos
and
the
other
indians
because
the
navajos
have
a
treaty
that
says
nothing
about
taxes.
immunity
from
taxation
is
not
to
be
implied.
if
congress
has
intended
to
accept
a
100,000
navajos
in
arizona
from
income
taxes,
they
would
certainly
have
said
so
in
clear
and
unmistakable
language.
now,
the
navajos
are
unusual
in
indian
reservation.
there
are
about
16
or
18
indian
reservations
in
the
state
of
arizona
and
the
navajos
are
not
represented.
they
are
an
extremely
large
reservation.
they
have
more
resources
than
the
average
reservation
does
and
so
they
certainly
require
a
less
assistance
than
the
other
reservations
do
because
some
of
the
reservations
are
so
small
that
they
are
hardly
an
economical
unit,
some
an
economical
governmental
unit.
some
of
them
may
only
have
a
few
hundred
acres
and
few
hundred
indians
on
them
and
they
can’t
provide,
they
can’t
receive
the
services
from
the
federal
government
that
the
state
would
provide
for
them
and
they
are
obviously
not
able
to
furnish
those
services
themselves.
but
even
the
navajo
indians
require
many
services
from
the
state
and
it’s
--
i
don’t
regard
as
important
but
counsel
for
the
other
side
mentioned
it
and
i
am
reluctant
to
mention
it
because
it’s
outside
the
record.
but
nevertheless,
according
to
the
information
from
our
governor’s
report
the
financial
picture
that
he
presented
of
the
relationship
of
the
indian
and
the
tribe
is
not
at
all
accurate.
the
state
does
have
a
very
substantial
state
in
the
sense
that
the
state
spends
a
lot
more
money
on
the
indian
reservations
and
it
gets
back
out
of
them
and
the
total
runs
into
millions
of
dollars.
now,
the
income
tax
on
net
income
is
a
very
fair
tax.
the
rate
structure
of
the
arizona
state
income
tax
is
a
low
one.
it
runs
from
1.5%
to
8%.
it
is
an
extremely
fair
way
to
balance
the
burdens
of
state
government.
mr.
james
d.
winter
that
is
true,
your
honor.
mr.
james
d.
winter
i
was
only
mentioning
them
because
it
had
been
mentioned
before
and
ever
since
the
warren
trading
post
case,
we
felt
that
the
state
does
make
provision
for
the
indians
on
the
reservation
and
of
course
the
state’s
rule
is
greatly
grown
but
i
agree.
i
have
no
further
arguments,
your
honor,
unless
the
court
has
any
questions.
thank
you.
mr.
james
d.
winter
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
issue
on
this
case
is
whether
or
not
the
state
of
arizona
can
impose
its
income
tax
on
income
of
a
navajo
indian
earned
on
the
navajo
indian
reservation
that
particular
indian
residing
on
the
reservation.
now,
there
are
a
number
of
cases
involving
the
question
of
federal
income
tax
liability
of
indians
residing
on
reservations.
and
those
cases
have
been
decided
in
favor
of
their
tax
liability.
in
the
oklahoma
tax
commission
case,
although
that
was
an
inheritance
tax
case,
nevertheless
the
government
having
the
decision
referred
to
the
income
tax
cases
and
state
and
federal
income
tax
liability
were
there
equated.
after
--
there
is
the
leahy
decision
involving
the
oklahoma
income
tax.
this
case
was
decided
in
the
1930s.
and
in
many
ways,
it
is
similar
to
the
situation
that
we
have
today
although
the
opinion
is
short.
the
briefs
throw
conservatively
more
light
on
the
subject.
the
all
state
indians
had
a
reservation.
they
had
a
treaty
with
the
federal
government.
they
had
a
tribal
government.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
united
states
congress
had
passed
the
law
providing
for
state
probate
jurisdiction
in
regard
to
the
osage
before
this
case
was
decided,
which
is
an
indication
that
they
had
a
viable
tribal
government.
now
in
that
particular
case,
the
court
upheld
the
state
taxation.
it
appeared
to
the
court
from
the
opinion
that
since
the
indians
received
the
income
and
were
free
to
dispose
of
it
as
they
wished
that
there
was
no
reason
why
they
shouldn’t
be
taxed
on
it.
mr.
james
d.
winter
i
beg
your
pardon,
mr.
justice?
mr.
james
d.
winter
in
the
leahy
case,
the
income
came
from
restricted
mineral
property.
this
was
property
that
was
owned
by
the
tribe,
the
osage
tribe.
mr.
james
d.
winter
no.
that
is
something
that
i
am
not
clear
about
because
i
wasn’t
able
to
find
anything
in
the
record
that
indicated
whether
it
was
on
or
off
the
reservation.
there
are
some
state
court
cases
now.
four
of
them
that
have
raised
this,
rather
five
of
them,
six
i
am
counting
this
case
in
which
the
question
is
raised
and
all
but
one
of
them,
the
brun
case
from
minnesota
were
decided
in
favor
of
tax
liability.
the
gahate
case
from
new
mexico
is
the
one
that
is
probably
most
like
ours.
it
involved
a
navajo
indian.
the
only
difference
between
the
gahate
case
and
ours
is
that
i
can
see
is
that
in
the
gahate
case,
counsel
for
the
navajo
stipulated
that
imposition
of
the
income
tax
by
the
state
of
new
mexico
did
not
infringe
upon
the
sovereignty
of
the
navajo
tribe.
the
counsel
was
unwilling
to
stipulate
that
in
our
case.
now,
in
the
brun
case,
the
court
did
apply
the
williams
versus
lee
test
absentee
--
the
test
of
validity
of
state
action
on
indian
reservation
is
whether
or
not
it
infringes
on
any
rights
granted
under
any
act
of
congress
or
upon
the
indian
right
of
self-government.
the
court
in
the
brun
case
concluded
that
the
imposition
of
the
minnesota
tax
infringed
on
the
right
of
self-government.
there
are
some
--
they
simply
assumed
that
it
did
apparently
because
of
the
economic
impact
of
the
tax.
in
other
words,
if
the
indians
had
to
pay
this
tax
to
the
state
of
minnesota
then
there
would
be
less
able
to
pay
a
tax
i
supposed
if
the
tribe
should
levy
a
tax.
at
any
rate,
this
decision
certainly
in
this
respect
is
in
conflict
with
decisions
in
cases
like
graves
versus
new
york
and
helvering
versus
gerhardt
which
involved
the
questions
of
whether
or
not
state
employees
had
to
pay
federal
income
taxes
and
whether
or
not
federal
employees
had
to
pay
state
income
taxes.
in
those
cases,
while
the
court
concluded
that
the
fact
that
an
employee
of
a
state
government
or
a
federal
government
had
to
pay
income
taxes
to
the
other
government
did
not
impose
any
sort
of
substantial
burden
on
that
other
government.
so,
we
have
a
test
--
a
practical
test
of
substantial
interference
with
the
essential
governmental
function.
the
court
in
the
brun
case
obviously
did
not
apply
that
test.
now,
one
other
factors
involved
in
this
connection,
this
tax
has
been
imposed
by
the
state
of
arizona
since
1957
at
least
when
attorney
general
opinion
on
the
state
of
arizona
was
rendered
on
that
subject
and
if
this
tax
really
infringed
upon
the
self-government
of
the
navajo
tribe.
it
would
seem
that
we
should
have
heard
about
it
before
now.
now,
in
--
mr.
james
d.
winter
yes,
your
honor?
mr.
james
d.
winter
if
the
tax
is
not
paid,
well
then
the
state
would
attempt
to
collect
it.
now,
on
a
question
of
whether
or
not
the
state
could
levy
on
the
navajo
reservation,
i
think
that
the
state
probably
would
not
attempt
to
do
that.
because
there
is
a
--
mr.
james
d.
winter
on
a
navajo
reservation?
mr.
james
d.
winter
i
don’t
know,
your
honor
but
i
am
inclined
to
think
that
the
state
could
not.
but
i
don’t
know.
mr.
james
d.
winter
under
our
enabling
act
we
cannot
tax
real
property
on
the
reservation.
it
is
specifically
excluded,
your
honor
from
property
taxation.
mr.
james
d.
winter
on
indians
residing
on
the
indian
reservation?
mr.
james
d.
winter
well,
the
only
thing
that
i
can
think
of
is
that
if
it
came
outside
of
the
scope
of
the
warren
trading
post
case.
in
other
words,
the
indians
involved
were
not
indian
traders
and
they
were
selling
items
on
the
indian
reservation.
well,
then
i
would
think
that
they
would
be
subject
to
the
sales
tax.
mr.
james
d.
winter
according
to
figures
that
we
have,
the
--
it
would
be
between
$2
million
and
$3
million
that
the
state
has
collected
according
to
a
governor’s
study
that
was
just
completed
in
our
state.
mr.
james
d.
winter
yes,
your
honor.
the
income
tax
but
that’s
all
reservations
on
the
state
and
the
navajo
reservation,
of
course
has
most
of
the
indian
population
in
the
state
because
although
the
state
may
have
a
125,000
indians,
80,000
or
90,000
live
on
the
navajo
reservation.
now,
it’s
our
position
that
williams
versus
lee
which
was
cited
by
counsel
for
the
appellee
is
distinguished
both
from
this
case
because
it
did
involved
infringement
up
on
the
right
of
self-government
of
the
navajo
tribe.
that
case
involved
the
jurisdiction
of
the
courts
and
there
the
court
concluded
that
the
state
courts
did
not
have
a
jurisdiction
over
what
were
essentially
trouble
matters,
matter
relating
to
the
liability
of
a
navajo
resident
of
the
reservation
in
connection
with
a
transaction
entered
into
on
the
reservation
and
that
for
the
same
reasons
and
for
the
additional
reasons
that
a
procedural
point
was
involved,
we
think
that
the
kennerly
case
is
also
distinguishable.
now,
various
arguments
have
been
raised
by
the
appellants
that
there
was
expressed
congressional
authorization
was
required
in
order
for
the
state
laws
to
apply
on
the
reservation.
this
is
an
extremely
narrow
question
as
i
think
that
the
united
states
has
already
conceded
in
regards
to
the
khan
case.
state
laws
may
have
on
indian
reservations
to
third
persons.
now,
i
think
that
state
laws
as
a
practical
matter
do
apply
on
indian
reservations.
when
you’re
talking
about
certain
benefits
or
even
benefits
that
are
not
conferred
by
federal
statutes
or
by
contract
under
the
johnson-o’malley
act
and
i
am
talking
about
such
things
as
the
right
to
vote.
when
a
navajo
indian
votes
on
a
navajo
reservation
in
a
state
election,
he
does
not
vote
under
tribal
law
or
a
federal
law.
he
is
voting
under
state
law.
now,
the
case
of
kake
versus
egan
set
down
what
we
considered
the
rule
to
be
that
state
laws
do
apply
on
indian
reservations
with
two
exceptions.
if
they
do
not
infringe
upon
the
tribal
government
of
the
tribe
or
if
they
do
not
infringe
upon
any
rights
which
were
granted
by
an
act
of
congress.
this
is
certainly
in
line
with
what
this
court
has
held
before
in
surplus
trading
company
versus
cook.
i
believe,
it
was
indicated
to
the
effect
that
state
laws
have
restricted
application
on
indian
reservations.
meaning
that
they
do
have
application
and
i
think
by
restricted
application
what
the
court
was
referring
to
were
the
exceptions
such
as
the
indian
right
of
self-government.
and
these
laws
cannot
apply
if
they
are
in
conflict
with
federal
laws.
and
then
in
new
york
versus
martin
where
the
court
said
that
in
the
absence
of
treaty
obligations
are
federal
statute’s
state
laws
do
apply
indian
reservations.
now,
it
is
our
position
that
no
act
of
congress
prohibits
application
of
state
income
taxes
to
indians.
the
first
statute
that
comes
to
mind
in
this
connection
in
chronological
order
is
the
state
enabling
act
of
the
state
of
arizona.
and
because
there
has
been
considerable
confusion
about
the
language,
i
would
just
like
to
read
the
language
that
has
been
the
subject
of
dispute
in
this
connection,
“that
the
people
inhabiting
the
said
proposed
state
do
agree
and
declare
that
they
forever
disclaim
all
right
entitled
to
the
unappropriated
and
ungranted
public
lands
lying
within
the
boundaries
thereof
and
all
lands
lying
within
said
boundaries
owned
or
held
by
any
indian
or
indian
tribes.
the
right
or
title
to
which
it
shall
have
been
acquired
through
or
from
the
united
states
or
any
prior
sovereignty
and
that
until
the
title
of
such
indian
or
indian
tribes
shall
have
been
extinguished
the
same
shall
be
and
remain
subject
to
the
disposition
and
under
the
absolute
jurisdiction
and
control
of
the
congress
of
the
united
states.”
these
are
what
we
referred
to
as
disclaimer
in
the
absolute
jurisdiction
and
control
provisions.
now,
they
do
not
refer
to
indian
reservations
although
subsequently
in
the
enabling
act
the
congress
did
refer
to
indian
reservations.
but
they
refer
to
indian
lands
and
the
reason
for
that
distinction
as
was
pointed
out
in
the
draper
case
was
because
in
the
general
allotment
act
of
1887,
congress
provided
that
indians
living
off
of
reservations
could
obtain
some
unappropriated
public
lands
that
would
be
subject
to
the
same
restrictions
as
lands
that
were
obtained
under
allotments.
it
was
a
desire
of
congress
at
the
time
that
arizona
was
admitted
to
the
union
to
protect
the
rights
of
the
indians
in
these
lands.
and
this
enabling
act
is
like
that
of
many
other
states.
and
this
was
done,
this
language
was
used,
indian
lands
were
referred
to
for
that
reason.
there
was
no
ambiguity
at
all
in
doing
it
and
i
think
that
this
is
confirmed
by
a
number
of
state
court
decisions
on
the
subject,
as
well
as
the
more
recent
decision
of
this
court
in
kake
versus
egan.
now,
there
has
--
public
law
280
was
enacted
in
1953.
at
that
time,
the
policy
of
the
federal
government
was
to
get
out
of
the
indian
reservations
or
it
was
the
termination
policy
and
this
was
one
of
--
and
because
this
was
the
concern
at
that
time,
the
provisions
of
280
provided
for
state
assumption
of
jurisdiction.
now,
there
was
also
some
confusion
at
that
time
about
what
the
state
enabling
acts
meant.
this
confusion
has
indicated
in
a
letter
that
we
have
quoted
from
that
was
in
the
committee
reports.
it’s
in
our
brief
and
so
congress
acted
partly
to
clear
up
this
confusion.
they
wanted
to
provide
a
procedure
so
that
the
states
would
not
consider
these
enabling
acts
to
be
a
stumbling
block.
so
that
they
would
assume
for
measure
of
jurisdiction
so
that
the
federal
government
could
be
relieved
of
all
responsibility
for
as
soon
as
the
indians
were
ready
for
this.
public
law
280
did
not
deprive
the
states
of
any
jurisdiction
that
they
already
have.
now,
the
civil
rights
act
of
1968
amended
public
law
280
in
effect
to
require
tribal
consent
to
the
state
assumption
of
jurisdiction.
there
is
one
more
item
and
that
is
the
treaty
of
1868.
and
that
treaty
has
nothing
at
all
in
and
about
the
tax
liability
of
the
indians.
it
was
in
1871
that
the
government
decided
that
the
indians
were
an
internal
problem
that
there
would
be
no
more
treaties
with
the
indians
and
it
would
not
seem
fair
to
distinguish
between
the
navajos
and
the
other
indians
because
the
navajos
have
a
treaty
that
says
nothing
about
taxes.
immunity
from
taxation
is
not
to
be
implied.
if
congress
has
intended
to
accept
a
100,000
navajos
in
arizona
from
income
taxes,
they
would
certainly
have
said
so
in
clear
and
unmistakable
language.
now,
the
navajos
are
unusual
in
indian
reservation.
there
are
about
16
or
18
indian
reservations
in
the
state
of
arizona
and
the
navajos
are
not
represented.
they
are
an
extremely
large
reservation.
they
have
more
resources
than
the
average
reservation
does
and
so
they
certainly
require
a
less
assistance
than
the
other
reservations
do
because
some
of
the
reservations
are
so
small
that
they
are
hardly
an
economical
unit,
some
an
economical
governmental
unit.
some
of
them
may
only
have
a
few
hundred
acres
and
few
hundred
indians
on
them
and
they
can’t
provide,
they
can’t
receive
the
services
from
the
federal
government
that
the
state
would
provide
for
them
and
they
are
obviously
not
able
to
furnish
those
services
themselves.
but
even
the
navajo
indians
require
many
services
from
the
state
and
it’s
--
i
don’t
regard
as
important
but
counsel
for
the
other
side
mentioned
it
and
i
am
reluctant
to
mention
it
because
it’s
outside
the
record.
but
nevertheless,
according
to
the
information
from
our
governor’s
report
the
financial
picture
that
he
presented
of
the
relationship
of
the
indian
and
the
tribe
is
not
at
all
accurate.
the
state
does
have
a
very
substantial
state
in
the
sense
that
the
state
spends
a
lot
more
money
on
the
indian
reservations
and
it
gets
back
out
of
them
and
the
total
runs
into
millions
of
dollars.
now,
the
income
tax
on
net
income
is
a
very
fair
tax.
the
rate
structure
of
the
arizona
state
income
tax
is
a
low
one.
it
runs
from
1.5%
to
8%.
it
is
an
extremely
fair
way
to
balance
the
burdens
of
state
government.
mr.
james
d.
winter
that
is
true,
your
honor.
mr.
james
d.
winter
i
was
only
mentioning
them
because
it
had
been
mentioned
before
and
ever
since
the
warren
trading
post
case,
we
felt
that
the
state
does
make
provision
for
the
indians
on
the
reservation
and
of
course
the
state’s
rule
is
greatly
grown
but
i
agree.
i
have
no
further
arguments,
your
honor,
unless
the
court
has
any
questions.
thank
you.
