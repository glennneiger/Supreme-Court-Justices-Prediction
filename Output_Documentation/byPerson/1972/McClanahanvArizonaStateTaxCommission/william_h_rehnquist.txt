well,
what
kind
of
a
tax
was
kansas
trying
to
levy
there,
mr.
collins?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
property
tax?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
get
any
support
for
your
schools
on
apache
county
or
navajo
county
in
addition
to
the
state?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
does
apache
county
with
whatever
source
it
may
have
contribute
something
to
the
financing
of
schools
on
the
reservation?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
if
arizona
had
accepted
the
congressional
offer,
would
that
have
authorized
it
to
tax,
do
you
think
mr.
collins?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
collins,
i
believe
one
of
the
state’s
contentions
is
that
if
we
accept
your
proposition
here
that
indians
at
least
for
this
purpose
are
a
discrete
group
who
are
not
subject
to
state
taxing
power,
then
when
the
indians
are
seeking
the
benefit
of
the
equal
protection
clause
to
assert
that
the
state
has
treated
them
in
a
discriminatory
manner,
logically
the
state
could
say,
well
you
know
more
less
by
their
own
choice.
they
are
different
and
we
can
treat
them
differently.
do
you
have
any
response
to
that?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
say
congress
--
the
constitution
has
given
congress
a
general
authority
over
the
affairs
of
indian.
would
you
say
that
congress
could
prohibit
a
state
from
taxing
or
criminally
dealing
with
a
non-reservation
indian
if
it
so
chose?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
in
squire
versus
capoeman
was
a
federal
–
has
federal
income
tax
too,
wasn’t
it?
i
mean
it
would
not
necessarily
carryover
to
the
state
income
tax.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
when
we
say
jurisdiction,
would
you
be
more
precise
about
what
you
mean
–
here,
i
take
it,
it
was
the
withholding
from
the
indians
employer
which
was
voluntary.
so
the
state
is
not
asserting
its
process
on
the
reservation.
do
you
mean
legislative
jurisdiction?
