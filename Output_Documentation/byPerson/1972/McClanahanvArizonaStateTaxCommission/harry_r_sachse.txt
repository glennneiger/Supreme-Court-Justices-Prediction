mr.
chief

and
may
it
please
the

the

with

in
this

i
want
to
try
to

then
to

the
amount
of
the

in

it’s
been
the

for
many
years
that
in
the
absence
of

that
--
some

are
consent

state

laws,
not

to
state
tax
laws
including

have
no

this
has

the
literally
hornbook
law
as
we
point
out
in
our
brief
with
the
quotation
to
mr.
felix
cohen’s
hornbook.
it
also
is
the
--
in
our
view
the
real
holding
of
williams

what’s
happened
is
that
the
court
in
the

which
had
nothing
to

with
tribal
--
with
reservation
indians
had
to
make
a

of

and
the
arizona

has
seized
on
that
one
sentence
paraphrase
to
try

the
states
to
act
without
congressional
authority
within
an
indian

whereas
in
fact
the
lee
decision
was
exactly
the
opposite.
the
language
that
i
think
is
the
clear
statement
of
lee
is
opinion
of
this
whole
case
of
course.
the
opinion
of
justice
black
at
page
220
of
358
u.s.
which
justice
black
said,
“congress
has
acted
consistently

the

that
the

have
no

the
affairs

and
justice
black
cites
four,
five
statutes
that
based
on
this
assumption
and
concludes
significantly
when
congress
has
wished
the
states
to
exercise
this
power.
it
has
expressly
granted
them
the
jurisdiction
which
worcester
versus
georgia
had
denied
them.
i
think
that’s
a
sound
basis
for
the
decision
in
this
case
and
if
we
adopt
the
view
of
the
supreme
court
of

it
would
be
opening
up
a
can

worms
as
to
what
laws
do
and
do
not
apply

indians
within
indian
reservations.
now,
i
want
to
use
the
time
that
i
have
to
bring
to
the
court’s
attention
a
number
of
individual
statutes
where
congress
has
chosen
whether
state
law
should
apply
within
indian
reservations
and
to
emphasize
particularity
with
which
congress
has
acted
in
this
respect.
i’ll
start
with
tax
laws,
but
it
pictures
equally
clear
with
general
laws.
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
our
position
is
that
the
constitution
gave
congress
full
authority
over
the
affairs
of
indians
that
congress
has
exercised
that
authority,
both
through
or
the
congress
and
government
through
treaties
and
through
setting
up
executive
order
reservations,
that
congress
further
exercise
the
authority
in
the
terms
of
enabling
acts
of
the
western
states
that
its
further
exercise
that
authority
by
from
time
to
time
providing
small
bits
of
jurisdiction
for
states
within
indian
reservations,
and
that
there’s
no
room
for
--
sir.
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
i
don’t
know.
i
don’t
think
so
and
certainly
that
issue
is
not
presented
in
--
in
this
case.
i
think
that
the
first
law
that
one
would
have
to
look
at
would
be
the
enabling
acts
of
the
states
and
to
see
to
what
extent
the
states
just
claim
jurisdiction.
now,
congress
has
as
indians
who
don’t
live
on
reservations
held
that--
that
they
can
only
be
tried
in
federal
courts
in
the
18
u.s.c.
and
defining
indian
country
doesn’t
--
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
yes,
it
does.
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
our
--
the
position
that
we
think
it’s
correct
is
that
as
to
reservation
indians.
you
start
with
the
assumption
that
state
laws
have
no
authority
over
those
indians
at
least
as
to
matters,
income
that
they’ve
earned
on
the
reservation.
as
to
non-reservation
indians,
you
start
with
the
proposition
that
they
can
be
tax
like
anyone
else.
if
they
can
show
a
particular
statute
that
gives
them
a
tax
exemption,
they
then
have
a
tax
exemption.
for
instance,
some
–
many
--
there
are
many
non-reservation
indians
who
live
on
allotments.
and
in
squire
versus
capoeman,
this
court
held
that
the
allotment
creates
a
tax
exemption.
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
i
would
think
so.
i
don’t
know.
i
don’t
want
to
state
a
government
position
on
that
issue.
certainly
if
the
income
is
earned
off
the
reservation
is
quite
a
difference
case
from
this
case.
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
no
except
in
a
fortiori
sense
that
the
federal
government
traditionally
has
had
greater
taxing
powers
over
indians
than
the
states
because
there
is
no
jurisdictional
problem
with
the
federal
government.
there’s
a
jurisdictional
problem
with
the
state
taxing
indians
at
least
within
an
indian
reservation.
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
yes,
sir.
i
mean
legislative
jurisdiction.
i
mean
the
application
of
state
laws
to
indians
within
an
indian
reservation.
that
is
what
i
mean
by
jurisdiction.
the
other
jurisdictional
problem
could
arise
to
if
--
but
were
not
a
situation
of
the
withholding
tax
if
the
state
were
trying
to
collect
its
tax
from
someone
who
had
not
paid
it.
he
then
would
have
the
question
of
the
state
collecting
--
trying
to
collect
the
tax
and
--
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
plus
tribal
government.
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
well,
with
non-indians
on
the
reservation,
the
situation
as
you
know
was
presented
in
kahn
in
the
petition
before
the
court.
now
the
court
has
not
acted
on
kahn
versus
arizona
tax
commission.
in
our
view,
that
is
a
much
more
difficult
case.
if
worcester
versus
georgia
stood
in
its
original
strength
then
kahn
couldn’t
be
taxed
either.
and
if
a
reservation
were
an
absolute
federal
enclave
in
which
the
state
can
have
no
authority
against
anyone
including
non-indians,
he
couldn’t
be
taxed
either.
but
we
admit
that
worcester
has
been
weakened
to
the
point
of
allowing
state
jurisdiction
where
it
applies
solely
to
non-indians
within
the
indian
reservation.
so
we
--
i
don’t
know
what
i
would
do
if
i
were
the
judge
deciding
the
case
or
--
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
unless
there
were
some
specific
federal
statute
authorized
and
i
think
in
the
time
that
i
have
left
which
is
not
too
much
that
i’d
best
mention
a
few
of
these
special
statutes.
for
instance,
in
1929,
i
believe
it
was,
the
congress
decided
it
would
be
a
good
idea
to
allow
the
state
motor
vehicle
fuel
taxes
to
apply
to
sales
of
motor
vehicle
fuel
whether
it
was
on
any
sort
of
federal
reservation
or
not
and
whether
it
was
sold
even
by
a
licensed
trader
or
not,
and
specifically
authorized
that
tax.
and
from
that
date
on
without
decisions
of
the
court
or
any
kind
of
serious
problem,
the
states
had
been
able
to
collect
the
motor
vehicle
tax
on
with
congressional
authority
within
indian
reservations.
in
1949,
when
congress,
at
the
time
when
military
bases
were
being
built
around
the
country,
1940
actually,
i
believe
it
was.
when
congress
considered
whether
it
wanted
to
allow
state
income
taxes
and
state
sales
taxes
to
apply
within
federal
areas
where
the
debate
on
this
act
which
is
called
the
buck
act.
debate
on
this
act
was
very
clear
that
some
congressmen
proposed
that
it
should
apply
within
indian
reservations
too.
the
department
of
the
interior
objected
to
that
and
wanted
to
have
indian
reservations
totally
excluded
from
the
act.
and
the
conclusion
that
congress
arrived
at
was
to
put
in
4
u.s.c.
109
which
says
though
the
states
may
assess
income
tax
within
federal
areas,
these
shall
not
apply
to
indians
not
otherwise
taxed
which
is
the
standard
phrase
for
indians
living
in
the
reservation
or
on
indian
country.
now,
we
do
not
say
–
we’re
not
trying
to
undo
the
footnote
on
the
warren
trading
post
case.
it
said
the
buck
act
did
not
apply
to
indian
reservations.
but
if
it
doesn’t
apply
to
indian
reservations
it
was
a
conscious
choice
by
congress
that
not
to
authorize
the
imposition
of
state
income
taxes
to
indians
within
indian
reservations.
similarly,
congress
has
authorized
the
taxation
of
mineral
interests
within
indian
reservations
but
in
doing
so,
it
did
it
with
particularity
and
only
authorized
the
taxation
of
mineral
interests
on
unallotted,
tribally-held
lands
and
then
provided
that
the
state
taxes
could
not
create
a
lien
on
the
land.
and
away
from
the
area
of
taxation,
i
don’t
think
i
need
to
discuss
public
law
280
here
that
of
course,
it
is
the
basic
statute
in
which
congress
authorized
states
to
exercise
a
broad
jurisdiction
that
also
with
broad
limits
within
indian
reservations.
but
i
want
to
point
out
this
one
particular
statute,
very
limited
statute
that
was
cited
in
the
kake
case,
that’s
25
u.s.c.
231.
congress
in
the
1930s
decided
that
it
would
be
a
good
idea
to
let
state
health
authorities
enter
indian
reservations
and
to
allow
state
truancy
officers
to
enter
indian
reservations.
obviously
considered,
they
took
a
congressional
act
to
do
this
but
when
congress
acted,
it
did
it
in
a
particular
way.
it
authorized
the
secretary
of
the
interior
to
allow
these
federal
officers
to
enter.
it
didn’t
direct
them
to
do
it.
it
authorized
them
at
his
discretion
to
do
it.
it
directed
him,
if
he
does
this
to
write
his
own
rules
and
regulations
to
determine
the
extent
to
which
the
state
officers
could
come
in
and
further
as
the
truancy
part
of
it
is
it
specifically
provided
that
this
could
only
be
done
with
the
consent
of
the
tribal
government
if
there
is
a
tribal
government
over
the
area
in
question.
now,
we
submit
that
this
is
the
way
that
states
should
obtain
jurisdiction
within
indian
reservations
if
they
are
to
obtain
it.
it
should
be
by
congressional
act
and
though
it’s
not
up
to
me
to
say
so
particularly,
i
think
the
congressional
act
should
also
require
the
consent
of
the
indian
tribe
because
when
the
reservations
were
created
whether
by
treaty
or
executive
order,
it
will
certainly
--
the
assumption
that
the
states
would
have
no
jurisdiction
within
those
reservations
under
worcester
versus
georgia
which
was
the
ruling
law
then.
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
i
don’t
think
it
rests
entirely
on
that.
i
am
not
able
to
--
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
i
would
agree
with
that
except
to
the
word
“the
constitution.”
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
well,
i
think
the
constitution
combined
with
the
treaties
made
with
the
indians
and
the
enabling
acts
of
the
states
requires
the
states
to
stay
out
of
indian
reservations
without
congressional
approval.
but
to
me
that’s
not
--
i
have
trouble
envisaging
this
with
the
constitution
without
thinking
of
the
fact
through
a
situation
to
whom
would
apply
to
namely
the
existence
of
an
indian
reservation.
and
the
constitution
did
not
order
the
federal
government
to
create
indian
reservations
but
no
federal
government
did.
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
i
would
say
that
if
the
indian
reservation
existed,
it
would
have
to
exist
by
executive
order
or
by
statute
or
by
treaty.
if
it
existed
in
any
of
those
ways
the
state
could
not
tax
within
that
indian
reservation
without
the
consent
of
the
federal
government.
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
united
states
agrees

mr.
collins’

reservation
indians.
you
start
with
the
assumption
that
state
laws
have
no
authority
over
those
indians
at
least
as
to
matters,
income
that
they’ve
earned
on
the
reservation.
as
to
non-reservation
indians,
you
start
with
the
proposition
that
they
can
be
tax
like
anyone
else.
if
they
can
show
a
particular
statute
that
gives
them
a
tax
exemption,
they
then
have
a
tax
exemption.
for
instance,
some
–
many
--
there
are
many
non-reservation
indians
who
live
on
allotments.
and
in
squire
versus
capoeman,
this
court
held
that
the
allotment
creates
a
tax
exemption.
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
i
would
think
so.
i
don’t
know.
i
don’t
want
to
state
a
government
position
on
that
issue.
certainly
if
the
income
is
earned
off
the
reservation
is
quite
a
difference
case
from
this
case.
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
no
except
in
a
fortiori
sense
that
the
federal
government
traditionally
has
had
greater
taxing
powers
over
indians
than
the
states
because
there
is
no
jurisdictional
problem
with
the
federal
government.
there’s
a
jurisdictional
problem
with
the
state
taxing
indians
at
least
within
an
indian
reservation.
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
yes,
sir.
i
mean
legislative
jurisdiction.
i
mean
the
application
of
state
laws
to
indians
within
an
indian
reservation.
that
is
what
i
mean
by
jurisdiction.
the
other
jurisdictional
problem
could
arise
to
if
--
but
were
not
a
situation
of
the
withholding
tax
if
the
state
were
trying
to
collect
its
tax
from
someone
who
had
not
paid
it.
he
then
would
have
the
question
of
the
state
collecting
--
trying
to
collect
the
tax
and
--
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
plus
tribal
government.
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
well,
with
non-indians
on
the
reservation,
the
situation
as
you
know
was
presented
in
kahn
in
the
petition
before
the
court.
now
the
court
has
not
acted
on
kahn
versus
arizona
tax
commission.
in
our
view,
that
is
a
much
more
difficult
case.
if
worcester
versus
georgia
stood
in
its
original
strength
then
kahn
couldn’t
be
taxed
either.
and
if
a
reservation
were
an
absolute
federal
enclave
in
which
the
state
can
have
no
authority
against
anyone
including
non-indians,
he
couldn’t
be
taxed
either.
but
we
admit
that
worcester
has
been
weakened
to
the
point
of
allowing
state
jurisdiction
where
it
applies
solely
to
non-indians
within
the
indian
reservation.
so
we
--
i
don’t
know
what
i
would
do
if
i
were
the
judge
deciding
the
case
or
--
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
unless
there
were
some
specific
federal
statute
authorized
and
i
think
in
the
time
that
i
have
left
which
is
not
too
much
that
i’d
best
mention
a
few
of
these
special
statutes.
for
instance,
in
1929,
i
believe
it
was,
the
congress
decided
it
would
be
a
good
idea
to
allow
the
state
motor
vehicle
fuel
taxes
to
apply
to
sales
of
motor
vehicle
fuel
whether
it
was
on
any
sort
of
federal
reservation
or
not
and
whether
it
was
sold
even
by
a
licensed
trader
or
not,
and
specifically
authorized
that
tax.
and
from
that
date
on
without
decisions
of
the
court
or
any
kind
of
serious
problem,
the
states
had
been
able
to
collect
the
motor
vehicle
tax
on
with
congressional
authority
within
indian
reservations.
in
1949,
when
congress,
at
the
time
when
military
bases
were
being
built
around
the
country,
1940
actually,
i
believe
it
was.
when
congress
considered
whether
it
wanted
to
allow
state
income
taxes
and
state
sales
taxes
to
apply
within
federal
areas
where
the
debate
on
this
act
which
is
called
the
buck
act.
debate
on
this
act
was
very
clear
that
some
congressmen
proposed
that
it
should
apply
within
indian
reservations
too.
the
department
of
the
interior
objected
to
that
and
wanted
to
have
indian
reservations
totally
excluded
from
the
act.
and
the
conclusion
that
congress
arrived
at
was
to
put
in
4
u.s.c.
109
which
says
though
the
states
may
assess
income
tax
within
federal
areas,
these
shall
not
apply
to
indians
not
otherwise
taxed
which
is
the
standard
phrase
for
indians
living
in
the
reservation
or
on
indian
country.
now,
we
do
not
say
–
we’re
not
trying
to
undo
the
footnote
on
the
warren
trading
post
case.
it
said
the
buck
act
did
not
apply
to
indian
reservations.
but
if
it
doesn’t
apply
to
indian
reservations
it
was
a
conscious
choice
by
congress
that
not
to
authorize
the
imposition
of
state
income
taxes
to
indians
within
indian
reservations.
similarly,
congress
has
authorized
the
taxation
of
mineral
interests
within
indian
reservations
but
in
doing
so,
it
did
it
with
particularity
and
only
authorized
the
taxation
of
mineral
interests
on
unallotted,
tribally-held
lands
and
then
provided
that
the
state
taxes
could
not
create
a
lien
on
the
land.
and
away
from
the
area
of
taxation,
i
don’t
think
i
need
to
discuss
public
law
280
here
that
of
course,
it
is
the
basic
statute
in
which
congress
authorized
states
to
exercise
a
broad
jurisdiction
that
also
with
broad
limits
within
indian
reservations.
but
i
want
to
point
out
this
one
particular
statute,
very
limited
statute
that
was
cited
in
the
kake
case,
that’s
25
u.s.c.
231.
congress
in
the
1930s
decided
that
it
would
be
a
good
idea
to
let
state
health
authorities
enter
indian
reservations
and
to
allow
state
truancy
officers
to
enter
indian
reservations.
obviously
considered,
they
took
a
congressional
act
to
do
this
but
when
congress
acted,
it
did
it
in
a
particular
way.
it
authorized
the
secretary
of
the
interior
to
allow
these
federal
officers
to
enter.
it
didn’t
direct
them
to
do
it.
it
authorized
them
at
his
discretion
to
do
it.
it
directed
him,
if
he
does
this
to
write
his
own
rules
and
regulations
to
determine
the
extent
to
which
the
state
officers
could
come
in
and
further
as
the
truancy
part
of
it
is
it
specifically
provided
that
this
could
only
be
done
with
the
consent
of
the
tribal
government
if
there
is
a
tribal
government
over
the
area
in
question.
now,
we
submit
that
this
is
the
way
that
states
should
obtain
jurisdiction
within
indian
reservations
if
they
are
to
obtain
it.
it
should
be
by
congressional
act
and
though
it’s
not
up
to
me
to
say
so
particularly,
i
think
the
congressional
act
should
also
require
the
consent
of
the
indian
tribe
because
when
the
reservations
were
created
whether
by
treaty
or
executive
order,
it
will
certainly
--
the
assumption
that
the
states
would
have
no
jurisdiction
within
those
reservations
under
worcester
versus
georgia
which
was
the
ruling
law
then.
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
i
don’t
think
it
rests
entirely
on
that.
i
am
not
able
to
--
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
i
would
agree
with
that
except
to
the
word
“the
constitution.”
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
well,
i
think
the
constitution
combined
with
the
treaties
made
with
the
indians
and
the
enabling
acts
of
the
states
requires
the
states
to
stay
out
of
indian
reservations
without
congressional
approval.
but
to
me
that’s
not
--
i
have
trouble
envisaging
this
with
the
constitution
without
thinking
of
the
fact
through
a
situation
to
whom
would
apply
to
namely
the
existence
of
an
indian
reservation.
and
the
constitution
did
not
order
the
federal
government
to
create
indian
reservations
but
no
federal
government
did.
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
i
would
say
that
if
the
indian
reservation
existed,
it
would
have
to
exist
by
executive
order
or
by
statute
or
by
treaty.
if
it
existed
in
any
of
those
ways
the
state
could
not
tax
within
that
indian
reservation
without
the
consent
of
the
federal
government.
