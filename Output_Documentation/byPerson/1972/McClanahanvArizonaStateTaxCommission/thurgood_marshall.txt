what
happen
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
--
if
tax
isn’t
paid?
justice
thurgood
marshall
do
you
mean
that
or
do
you
say
that
the
state
could
not
do
it?
do
you
think
the
state
could
levy
on
that
property?
that
real
property?
justice
thurgood
marshall
yes,
sir.
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
a
state
tax
the
real
property
of
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
other
tax
do
you
put
on?
justice
thurgood
marshall
yes,
sir.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
how
many
of
the
indians
living
on
the
reservation
that
paid
the
sales
tax?
i
mean
that
paid
the
income
tax?
justice
thurgood
marshall
on
income
tax?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
would
assume
that
the
former
chief
justice
of
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
in
oklahoma
paid
income
tax
because
he
was
choctaw
indian
but
he
was
also
the
chief
judge.
so
i
assume,
he
paid
state
income
tax
and
i
don’t
see
what’s
your
ending
do
with
this
case
at
all?
