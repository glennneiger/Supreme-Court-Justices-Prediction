mr.
collins,
orient
me
a
little
bit
as,
are
there
vest
sums
involved
in
this
test
case
or
the
mainly
principal
that
we
are
talking
about?
i
realize
how
important
the
principal
is.
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
are
there
other
sums
that
other
taxpayers
are
concerned
with?
unknown
speaker
does
the
record
show
precisely
what
her
work
was
that
produce
the
income
that
was
taxed?
unknown
speaker
one
last
question
on
the
--
has
the
tribe
itself
ever
levied
an
income
tax
on
the
members
of
it?
unknown
speaker
thank
you.
unknown
speaker
what
is
the
extent
of
their
claim,
are
they
making
the
same
claim
if
arizona’s
opt
to
the
tax
a
reservation
indian
on
income
earned
outside
the
reservation?
unknown
speaker
well,
what
would
be
--
what
would
your
--
what
would
be
your
position?
unknown
speaker
you
wouldn’t
be
making
the
argument
you’re
making
here?
unknown
speaker
you
wouldn’t
think
your
argument
here
would
be
valid
in
that
case?
unknown
speaker
and
would
--
and
would
--
would
this
argument
cover
a
member
of
the
tribal
who
leave
off
the
reservation?
unknown
speaker
even
though
--
even
though
her
earns
his
income
on
the
reservation?
unknown
speaker
and
as
well
as
vote,
does,
is
the
--
does
the
state
furnish
various
services
to
the
tribe
education
or
--
unknown
speaker
well
the
voting
thing
isn’t
part
of
the
record
either?
is
it
or
isn’t?
unknown
speaker
military
jurisdiction
has
always
been
based
on
the
status
of
the
accused
rather
than
on
the
nature
of
the
offense.
unknown
speaker
mr.
sachse,
why
take
it
then
that
your
position
is
based
primarily
on
statutes
rather
than
the
constitution?
unknown
speaker
does
your
position
make
room
for
the
state
to
tax
non-reservation
indian?
unknown
speaker
income
tax
and
inheritance
tax?
unknown
speaker
and
that
would
go
i
supposed
for
reservation
indians
earning
income
off
the
reservation,
going
off
the
reservation
to
work,
state
to
tax
that
income?
unknown
speaker
it’s
a
location
plus
being
an
indian.
unknown
speaker
plus
tribal
government,
because
non-indians
on
the
reservation
you
don’t
have
any
problem
with
that?
unknown
speaker
unless
there
were
some
specific
federal
statute
that
--
unknown
speaker
well
then,
are
you
saying
that
absent
a
specific
federal
statute
granting
the
power
to
tax
the
constitution
or
requires
the
state
to
stay
out
of
the
reservation,
is
that
it?
unknown
speaker
well
that’s
a
big,
big
exempt.
unknown
speaker
there
were
no
federal
statutes
on
the
question
only
the
constitution.
could
the
state
tax,
i
would
rather
you
would
say
no.
unknown
speaker
am
i
not
right
in
remembering
that
in
the
lee
case?
somewhere
in
the
course
in
that
opinion,
i
think
in
the
footnote.
the
distinctively
different
oklahoma
situation
was
mentioned.
unknown
speaker
and
it
is
a
distinctively
different
situation
at
least
to
find
specific
statute
a
predecessor
was
not
of
the
more
generalized
280.
