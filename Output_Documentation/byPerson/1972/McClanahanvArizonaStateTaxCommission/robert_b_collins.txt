mr.
robert
b.
collins
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
appeal
from
the
state
courts
of
arizona
where
appellant
filed
suit
to
recover
state
income
tax
withheld
from
her
income.
she
claims
that
the
state
has
no
jurisdiction
to
collect
its
state
income
tax
from
her
on
a
ground
that
she
is
a
navajo
indian
who
at
all
relevant
times
live
and
worked
within
the
boundaries
of
navajo
indian
reservation.
the
state
courts
of
arizona
denied
her
claim
despite
an
unbroken
line
of
decisions
by
this
court
that
states
have
no
jurisdiction
over
the
reservation
affairs
of
indians.
this
court
first
interpreted
the
constitutional
relationship
between
the
states
and
indian
tribes
in
1982
in
the
case
of
worcester
against
georgia.
mr.
chief
justice
marshall’s
opinion
reviews
in
detail
the
constitutional
provisions
that
relate
to
indians
and
concludes
that
plain
area
authority
over
indian
is
conferred
by
the
constitution
on
the
federal
government
and
at
state
laws
can
have
no
force
or
effect
on
indian
reservations.
subsequent
decisions
of
this
court
modified
that
decision
in
one
area
where
the
referrals
of
non-indians
only
are
involved
on
an
indian
reservation
and
where
the
indians
were
not
directly
involved
at
all.
in
addition,
congress
has
exercised
its
plain
area
authority
on
certain
occasions
to
grant
to
the
states
authority
over
reservation
indians.
mr.
robert
b.
collins
your
honor,
the
actual
amount
of
tax
that
appellant
sought
to
regain
was
$16.20.
mr.
robert
b.
collins
your
honor,
she
filed
the
action
as
a
class
action
that
never
reached
any
decision
as
to
whether
it
was
properly
a
class
action
under
state
procedures
in
the
state
of
arizona.
i’m
sure
that
the
court
decision
bears
on
--
on
thousands
of
indians
in
the
state
of
arizona.
arizona
nearly
a
hundred
thousand
indians,
most
of
them
live
on
reservations.
i
think
it
affects
them
all.
mr.
robert
b.
collins
i
don’t
believe
so,
your
honor
because
the
matter
was
decided
on
the
motion
o
dismiss.
the
complaint
stands
alone
as
an
allegation
of
fact.
she
works
for
a
bank
on
the
reservation.
i
don’t
know
that
--
that’s
in
the
record.
mr.
robert
b.
collins
no,
your
honor.
the
tribe
has
a
sales
--
when
effect
to
sales
tax,
but
has
no
income
tax.
mr.
robert
b.
collins
the
decisions
of
this
court
where
summed
up
in
the
only
treaties
on
indian
law
ever
produced
by
mr.
felix
cohen
in
1942.
he
stated,
“state
laws
generally
are
not
applicable
to
tribal
indians
on
an
indian
reservation
except
for
congress
as
expressly
provided
that
state
law
shall
apply.
it
follows
the
indians
and
indian
property
on
an
indian
reservation,
are
not
subject
to
state
taxation,
except
by
virtue
of
an
expressed
authority
conferred
upon
the
state
by
act
of
congress.”
it
is
our
contention
that
rule
applies
here
that
arizona
has
acted
in
contravention
of
that
rule
and
that
this
court
should
reverse
on
that
account.
now
that
rule
doesn’t
apply
to
all
indians.
there
are
indians
who
were
never
placed
under
federal
protection,
never
got
a
reservation.
there
are
other
indians
over
whom
the
federal
protection
has
been
ended
by
congress
beginning
with
oklahoma
in
the
late
19th
century.
but,
the
navajos
are
still
fully
under
federal
protection.
in
1868,
united
states
entered
into
a
treaty
with
the
navajos
under
which
the
navajos
agreed
to
peace
under
the
protection
of
united
states
and
the
reservation
was
set
aside
for
their
exclusive
use.
the
treaty
specifically
provides
that
outsiders
cannot
enter
the
reservation
without
permission
of
the
navajos
with
the
exception
of
federal
agents.
in
1912,
44
years
later
arizona
was
admitted
to
the
union.
however,
the
united
states
honored
is
treaty
commitment
to
the
navajos
by
conditioning
that
admission
in
the
arizona
enabling
act
on
the
expressed
ground
that
arizona
agreed
the
reservations
indian
affairs
remain
under
the
exclusive
control
of
congress.
in
1949,
congress
passed
a
bill
which
would
have
ceded
concurrent
authority
over
reservation
indians
in
arizona
to
--
over
the
navajos
to
the
state
of
arizona.
but
president
truman
vetoed
the
bill
expressly
because
he
objected
to
that
provision,
and
today
the
navajos
have
a
comprehensive
tribe
government
which
rules
territory
in
three
different
states.
it
has
a
full
court
system
that
adjudicates
all
civil
matters
arising
between
indians
on
the
reservation
and
all
misdemeanors
as
to
indians
on
the
reservation.
it
has
an
appellate
court
the
rules
as
to
questions
of
law
as
does
this
court.
it
has
a
bar
with
navajo
advocates
who
practice
before
the
courts.
it
has
its
own
police
system.
it
has
many
regularity
functions
that
deal
with
the
things
that
the
--
are
important
to
the
navajo
people
such
as
stock
raising,
business
licensing,
and
alike.
a
long
list
of
regularity
services
are
provided
by
state
government
--
by
the
tribal
government
that
are
comfortable
to
those
provided
by
state
and
local
government
elsewhere.
we
detail
this
in
our
reply
brief
and
it
does
tax
its
people.
there
is
a
gross
receipts
tax
on
sales
on
the
reservation
in
effect
to
sale
tax.
the
governmental
functions
on
the
reservation
that
are
not
tribal
are
by
enlarged
federal.
all
healthcares
delivered
by
the
federal
government
to
the
united
states
public
health
service.
roads
are
built
by
federal
government
and
so
forth.
the
navajos
are
poor
the
federal
services
are
important
to
them
at
this
time.
now,
we
have
argued
three
grounds
independent
legal
grounds
for
reversal
of
this
case.
i
intend
to
address
myself
essentially
to
one
of
them.
the
one
set
out
really
in
mr.
cohen’s
role
that
i
recited
earlier.
that
this
--that
dispute
focuses
on
the
1959
decision
of
this
court
in
williams
against
lee.
that
case
also
involved
the
navajo
indians.
in
that
case,
a
non-indian
brought
suit
against
a
navajo
couple
in
the
state
courts
of
arizona
based
on
a
reservation
incurred
debt.
the
navajos
moved
to
dismiss
in
the
ground
that
the
tribal
government
alone
had
jurisdiction
over
the
cause
of
action.
the
arizona
supreme
court
denied
that
claim
ruling
that
because
no
act
of
congress
expressly
forbad
the
state
court
jurisdiction.
the
state
court
must
have
jurisdiction.
that’s
the
very
claim
arizona
makes
here.
we
are
just
having
a
renewal
of
the
same
dispute.
in
that
case,
this
court
reversed,
unanimously
reversed
the
arizona
supreme
court
in
an
opinion
which
forcefully
renewed
the
federal
protection
over
reservation
indian
governments.
this
court
referred
to
the
treaty
between
the
navajo
people
and
the
federal
government
in
these
terms,
“implicit
in
this
treaty
terms
was
the
understanding
that
the
internal
affairs
of
the
indians
remain
exclusively
within
the
jurisdiction
of
whatever
tribal
government
existed.”
now,
the
court
went
on
to
acknowledge
that
decisions
of
this
court
had
applied
state
laws
in
indian
reservations
to
the
affairs
of
non-indians
and
recited
the
cases
were
that
have
been
done.
and
to
that
extent
that
the
old
case
of
worcester
against
georgia
had
been
modified.
however,
in
the
very
same
sentence,
the
court
said,
“the
basic
policy
of
worcester
has
remained.”
in
other
words,
the
policy
that
the
affairs
of
the
indians
themselves
on
the
reservation
are
under
exclusively
federal
and
tribal
authority.
this
court
also
emphasized
the
meticulous
control
which
congress
has
exercised
over
the
years
of
the
reservation
indian
affairs.
the
court
stated
that
congress
had
acted
consistently
upon
the
assumption
that
the
states
have
no
power
to
regulate
indian
affairs
on
reservations
and
that
when
congress
has
wished
the
states
to
exercise
the
power,
it
is
granted
them
the
jurisdiction
which
worcester
against
georgia
denied
the
states.
now,
in
the
phase
of
this
unbroken
string
of
decisions,
the
arizona
court
below
essentially
tried
to
avoid
the
affect
of
the
decision
on
two
grounds.
first,
the
court
below
dealt
with
this
court’s
decision
in
williams
against
lee
by
distinguishing
--
creating
a
distinction
i
would
say
between
the
affairs
of
the
navajo
tribe
and
the
affairs
of
individual
navajo
indians.
the
court
seems
to
say
that
if
the
state
invasion
does
not
cripple
the
tribal
government,
that
is
okay.
however,
this
court
has,
in
many
occasions
ruled
that
affairs
of
individual
indians
on
reservations
are
subject
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
tribe
and
not
the
states.
in
the
kansas
indians
a
19th
century
case,
this
court
expressly
ruled
that
the
state
of
kansas
could
not
tax
individual
indians
--
in
the
state
--
in
that
state.
the
affairs
of
the
tribe
were
not
involved
at
all.
mr.
robert
b.
collins
that
was
a
property
tax,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
b.
collins
yes.
in
a
much
more
recent
case,
i
think
they
were
both
personal
and
real
property
in
that
case.
in
a
much
more
recent
case,
in
kennerly
against
district
court
of
montana,
the
montana
district
court,
excuse
me,
the
montana
supreme
court
made
the
same
sort
of
ruling.
it
said
that
a
personal
debt
of
an
individual
indian
is
not
a
tribal
affair.
this
court
overruled
that
decision
in
this
court’s
opinion
in
kennerly
against
district
court
of
montana.
and
of
course,
williams
against
lee
itself
really
involved
the
personal
affairs
on
an
indiana.
the
tribe
wasn’t
a
party
to
the
case.
all
the
tribe
did
was
provided
a
court
where
the
navajo
contended
the
manner
should
have
been
heard.
now,
the
--
the
language
in
this
court’s
opinion
in
williams
against
lee
that
arizona
relies
on
is
what
the
briefs
refer
to
as
the
infringement
test.
in
reads
the
question
has
always
been
whether
the
state
action
infringed
on
the
right
of
reservation
indians
to
make
their
own
laws
and
be
ruled
by
them.
we
suggest
that
arizona
has
badly
distorted
the
meaning
of
that
phrase.
of
course,
the
phrase
begins
with
the
question
has
always
been.
it
is
not
a
new
rule.
in
other
words,
the
court
was
referring
to
the
time
honored
rule
that
reservation
indians
are
entitled
to
govern
their
own
affairs.
furthermore,
the
court
state
makes
their
own
laws
and
be
ruled
by
them.
we
suggest
what
that
means
is,
the
laws
that
indians
make
rule
rather
than
state
laws.
now
--
mr.
robert
b.
collins
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
b.
collins
there
will
be
shortly,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
b.
collins
there
has,
i
believe
one
--
one
occasion
that
i
know
about.
they
may
have
been
more.
mr.
robert
b.
collins
yes,
sir.
that
convinced
us.
mr.
robert
b.
collins
that’s
--
that’s
correct.
they
do
participate
in
the
state
government
and
there
is
a
certain
amount
of
interaction
between
reservation
affairs
and
state
affairs
that
has
been
authorized
by
congress.
our
contention
is
it’s
up
to
congress
to
adjust
that
relationship.
it’s
not
up
to
arizona
that
whenever
congress
has
wanted
to
adjust
that
relationship,
it
is
done
so
in
detail.
congress
has
specifically
said
that
states
can
--
can
levy
certain
taxes
against
reservation
indians,
but
not
the
tax
that’s
as
issue
here.
and
we
suggest
that
that
congress
i
think
can
be
appealed
to
with
any
question
of
adjustment
of
the
relationship.
now
--
mr.
robert
b.
collins
yes,
your
honor.
they
didn’t
vote
because
they
weren’t
considered
citizens.
mr.
robert
b.
collins
that’s
--
that’s
correct.
the
indian
citizenship
was
granted
by
act
of
congress
in
1924,
but
since
that
time
this
court
has
repeatedly
rule
on
the
question
of
federal
protection
over
indians
and
has
repeatedly
rejected
the
contention
that
citizenship
ends
the
protection.
it
is
up
to
congress
to
end
it
specifically
and
it
hasn’t
been
done
implicitly
in
some
act
like
the
citizenship
act.
the
--
now
the
--
a
subsequent
decision
of
this
court
in
organized
village
of
kake
against
egan,
had
a
sentence
in
it
which
paraphrase
some
of
the
decisions
of
this
court
in
earlier
decisions
of
this
court
including
williams
against
lee.
and
that
sentence
has
also
been
seized
upon
by
the
arizona
court
and
some
other
state
courts
in
an
effort
to
infer
the
somehow
the
door
is
open
to
state
application
of
their
laws
on
indian
reservations.
we
suggest
that
that
sentence
has
been
taken
out
of
context
and
misread.
the
kake
case
involved
indians
not
on
a
reservation
who
had
no
comprehensive
tribal
government
that
did
not
rule
any
distinct
territory
and
therefore
was
quite
different
from
a
navajos.
and
i
think
that
--
mr.
robert
b.
collins
if
the
indian
income
earned
off
the
reservation,
your
honor,
i
think
that
the
question
would
be
one
of
what
sometimes
turn
taxing
--
termed
taxing
jurisdiction,
a
due
process
issue.
mr.
robert
b.
collins
i
think
it
would
depend
on
the
particular
facts.
taxing
jurisdiction
decisions
to
go
into
the
question
of
a
benefit
burden
theory
of
taxation,
how
much
services
are
received
and
that
sort
of
thing.
i
think
there
such
--
mr.
robert
b.
collins
no
sir.
i
would
not.
mr.
robert
b.
collins
i
think
that
--
i
think
that
the
indians
based
on
the
argument
i’m
making
here
would
be
entitled
to
the
same
kind
of
considerations
as
prevailed
in
--
in
other
cases
where
courts
have
considered
taxing
jurisdiction
over
nine
residents
essentially.
that
kind
of
situation,
i
think
those
kinds
of
issues
would
govern
that
--that
situation.
mr.
robert
b.
collins
no,
your
honor,
not
at
all.
if
the
tribal
member
leaves
off
the
reservation
he
is
subject
to
state
jurisdiction.
i
think
that
settled
long.
we’re
not
--we’re
not
suggesting
otherwise.
mr.
robert
b.
collins
well,
that
–
that
that
just
turns
around
the
taxing
jurisdiction
question.
that
makes
the
tribe
have
to
justify
its
taxing
jurisdiction,
i
think,
if
that
occurred.
but
those
--
those
cases
involved
the
interaction
of
two
taxing
jurisdictions
in
the
way
where
we
have
--
you
know
city’s
taxing
commuters
and
that
kind
of
question
of
taxing
jurisdiction.
there
is
a
discussion
of
that
issue
and
one
of
the
amicus
briefs,
but
i
don’t
think
it’s
relevant
to
the
main
question
here.
mr.
robert
b.
collins
the
state
furnishes
a
very
minor
amount
of
services
to
the
tribe,
your
honor.
i
lived
in
window
rock
on
the
reservation
and
the
schools
there
--this
is
not
in
the
record
your
honor,
but
it
--
if
this
is
a
relevant
issue
we
pointed
out,
the
matter
should
be
remanded
because
it
is
not
a
record
as
to
either
side.
but,
i
lived
in
window
rock,
the
school
budget
in
our
school
district
where
i
live
is
about
20%
state
supported.
mr.
robert
b.
collins
well,
that
is
a
matter
of
decision
of
law
in
arizona.
there
is
a
decision
of
the
arizona
courts
that
reservation
indians
can
vote
in
the
state
and
that
--
that
is
cited
in
the
briefs.
but,
i’d
say
it
may
be
10%
of
the
support
for
education
on
the
reservation
comes
in
state
sources
overall,
perhaps
10%
of
the
source
of
welfare
money.
that’s
about
it.
there
aren’t
many
other
state
services
of
any
significance
on
the
reservation
and
furthermore,
those
reservations
schools
are
educating
non-indians.
i
mean
i
could
have
children
on
reservation
schools
and
i
pay
state
taxes.
this
issue
doesn’t
concern
me.
mr.
robert
b.
collins
there
is
a
real
property
tax
levy,
your
honor,
that’s
local.
there
are
real
property
interests
on
the
reservation
that
are
taxable.
indian
mineral
production
is
taxable
under
the
state
system
and
apache
county
administered
that,
but
the
source
of
money
is
all
under
reservation.
there
isn’t
any
money
that
comes
from
off
the
reservations
supporting
reservations
schools
from
apache
county.
mr.
robert
b.
collins
yes,
it
does
your
honor.
if
you
mean
in
the
sense
that
apache
county
derives
money
from
reservation
resources
and
reapplies
it
for
reservation?
yes,
that’s
correct.
i
think
that
the
importance
of
the
difference
between
this
case
and
the
court’s
decision
in
organized
village
of
kake
against
egan
is
shown
by
the
fact
that
later
on,
this
court
ruled
in
warren
trading
post
company
against
arizona
tax
commission
that
again
the
navajos
are
entitled
to
self-government.
there
were
other
issues
in
that
case,
but
the
court
distinctly
renewed
the
commitment
to
the
protection
of
the
navajos
government
and
of
course
the
supreme
court
of
minnesota
has
ruled
contrary
to
the
arizona
courts
in
a
decision
that
we
think
was
correct.
i
think
that
the
--
an
important
point
is
to
consider
the
implications
of
the
state’s
position
here
on
indians
themselves.
first
of
all,
the
state’s
position,
have
they
acknowledged
that
williams
against
lee
is
right,
they
have
too.
it’s
a
decision
of
this
court.
once
it’s
going
--
they
haven’t
contended
so
far
that
it
should
be
overruled.
now,
that
means
that
sometimes
they
don’t
have
jurisdiction
to
apply
their
laws
under
reservation.
now,
they
say
sometimes
they
do
and
we
have
a
constitutional
question
each
time
you
decide.
obviously,
this
is
very
productive
of
litigation.
i
mean
each
case
has
to
be
taken
to
an
appellate
decision.
well
that’s
not
too
serious
a
problem,
but
consider
the
situation,
the
uncertainty
that’s
created
for
reservation
indian.
merely
sitting
there
and
he
receives
a
letter
from
some
state
bureau
in
phoenix
that
tells
him
he
must
do
something
because
state
law
requires
it.
and
he
has
to
decide
whether
that
state
law
under
constitutional
principles
that
they
suggest
to
apply
--
conflicts
with
his
tribal
law
in
some
way
or
other.
well,
that
uncertainty
seems
to
me
to
be
not
warranted.
i
don’t
think
this
court
intended
to
create
that
kind
of
uncertainty
when
it
decided
williams
against
lee
and
that’s
why
we
contend
that
williams
against
lee
has
been
misread.
we
suggests
--
mr.
robert
b.
collins
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
b.
collins
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
at
the
time
we
adjourned,
i
was
pointing
out
that
the
implications
of
arizona’s
position
create
great
uncertainty
for
reservation
indians.
each
indian
must
decide
that
his
peril
whether
his
particular
situation
--
in
a
particular
situation
applied
to
him
whether
the
state
law
that’s
being
applied
conflicts
with
tribal
authority.
and
the
third
implication
of
the
state’s
position
is
that
under
the
word
state
views
this
law.
the
state
can
pick
and
choose
when
to
come
on
to
the
reservation.
we
see
them
trying
to
tax
where
it’s
to
their
advantage.
congress
offered
the
states
in
public
law
280
the
opportunity
to
assume
a
broad
range
of
jurisdiction
of
some
sort.
in
return
the
states
were
to
assume
certain
burden
such
as
the
burdens
of
manning
the
courts
and
police
that
had
been
born
by
the
indians
in
the
federal
government.
it’s
clear
that
the
congress’
intent
was
that
the
--
that
the
burden
of
these
services
be
born
by
the
state
and
arizona
is
attempting
an
avoidance
of
that
--
of
that
intent
of
congress.
mr.
robert
b.
collins
justice
rehnquist,
the
--
that
question
i’m
fully
aware
is
the
central
question
of
the
case
to
follow
this
one
and
i’m
not
certain
the
full
reaches
of
public
law
280.
since
it
is
going
to
be
fully
argued
by
competent
counsel
in
that
case,
i
prefer
not
to
comment
on.
but
it
just
seems
to
me
clear
that
in
the
absence
of
compliance
with
public
law
280,
it’s
absolutely,
(inaudible)
the
jurisdiction
to
tax.
the
full
reach
of
that
act
is
important
question
and
--
mr.
robert
b.
collins
i
think
that
if
--
i
think
that
what
congress
does
is
congress
in
by
virtue
of
its
protection
of
the
indians
provides
substantial
services
are
quite
large
services
which
are
detailed
in
this
court’s
opinion
in
warren
trading
post
company
against
arizona
tax
commission.
but
congress
has
suggested
in
certain
cases,
public
law
280
is
one
example
on
the
termination
laws
in
the
1950
or
another
that
federal
protection
be
withdrawn,
but
that
leaves
the
indians
as
ordinary
citizens
of
the
state
with
no
federal
protection,
no
federal
services,
that
means
the
states
have
to
provide
normal
services
to
them
that
they
are
not
now
providing.
in
that
sense,
the
congress
can
impose
the
duty
on
that
states,
yes.
mr.
robert
b.
collins
your
honor,
i
think
that
--
i
think
that
the
economic
relationship
between
the
tribes
and
the
states
is
controlled
by
congress.
i
think
on
the
other
hand,
congress
has
made
indian
citizens
of
the
states
and
they
are
entitled
to
the
right
of
citizens.
this
has
gotten
into
detail
in
our
reply
brief
to
which
i
refer
for
a
complete
answer,
but
our
position
is
that
there
might
be
some
question
about
that.
the
federal
government
provides
broad
services
if
those
were
withdrawn,
the
equities
might
be
grossly
altered,
but
everything
stands
the
states
provide
very
good
services
to
the
navajos.
the
state
has
limited
taxing
authority
for
the
navajos.
the
economic
thing
is
in
pretty
balance.
i
think
the
state
is
trying
to
upset
that.
i
think
that
if
a
radical
change
were
coming
and
has
to
come
from
the
federal
government
because
it’s
the
federal
government
that
is
providing
the
services
to
keep
that
economic
situation
in
balance.
and
it’s
up
to
congress
to
change
this.
it’s
up
to
congress
to
order
the
arrangement.
but
i
do
answer
question,
yes.
i
think
that
they
are
citizen
of
the
states
and
entitled
to
the
rights
of
citizens.
mr.
robert
b.
collins
i
think
preemption
would
be
the
proper
word,
your
honor,
yes.
mr.
robert
b.
collins
i
think
the
thrust
of
--
mr.
robert
b.
collins
no,
your
honor.
i
think
it’s
the
constitution.
i
think
that
worcester
against
georgia
rules
that
under
the
constitution,
indians
affairs
are
preempted
by
the
federal
government.
now,
the
courts
have
subsequently
ruled
--
mr.
robert
b.
collins
no,
sir.
congress
can
--
i
agree
with
that.
congress
has
the
power
to
see
jurisdiction
of
the
states
and
has
repeatedly
and
in
detailed
then
so,
i
think
mr.
sachse
for
the
united
states
is
going
to
elaborate
on
some
of
the
particular
laws
that
are
relevant
here,
but
--
mr.
robert
b.
collins
i
believe,
your
honor
that
–
that
the
court’s
opinions
have
referred
to
several
constitutional
provisions.
the
indian
commerce
clause,
the
treaty
power
and
supremacy
clause
are
combined
leading
to
the
rule
of
worcester
against
georgia.
mr.
robert
b.
collins
state
inheritance
taxes,
yes
i
would.
mr.
robert
b.
collins
non-reservation
indians
and
indians
receiving
full
services
from
the
state
where
involved
in
those
cases
and
that’s
--
that’s
all
the
difference
in
the
world,
if
they’re
not
on
reservation,
they’re
not
entitled
to
the
protection
of
the
federal
treaty
and
so
forth.
mr.
robert
b.
collins
a
few
i
think,
in
very
small
reservations,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
b.
collins
i
think
that
it’s
open
to
contention
that
some
of
this
court’s
decisions
have
depended
on
their
being
a
tribal
government
in
existence.
i’m
not
sure
how
they
would
apply
it.
it
happens
in
fact
that
most
of
the
small
reservations
are
now
under
public
law
280
and
are
governed
by
that
law
specifically.
arizona
has
never
complied
with
public
law
280
and
the
states
that
have
not
are
ones
are
states
with
large
reservation
with
tribal
departments
by
enlarge.
so,
i’m
not
sure
that
question
exist
in
reality,
but
--
mr.
robert
b.
collins
yes,
your
honor,
it
definitely
does.
i
mean
the
navajo
tribe
is
quite
interested
in
this
case
to
file
a
brief
in
support
of
the
jurisdiction
--
mr.
robert
b.
collins
it
might
be.
i
would
suppose
it
might
be.
i’m
not
sticking
it
if
the
--
that’s
the
question
i
can’t
answer
definitely.
in
conclusion,
we
just
--
we
want
to
urge
that
we’re
not
asking
for
a
change
on
the
law.
we’re
asking
that
this
court
reaffirmed
it’s
historic
commitment
to
the
self-government
indian
reservations
and
further
more
that
this
court
and
the
uncertainty
that
has
been
created
by
what
arizona
has
done
in
a
couple
of
other
states
in
trying
to
interpret
other
decisions
of
this
court
as
allowing
this
invasion
of
the
indian
jurisdiction.
we’re
talking
about
what
we
contend
is
a
settled
area
of
jurisprudence.
the
prior
decisions
of
this
court
and
acts
of
congress
make
it
clear
that
the
arizona
court
below
was
wrong
and
should
be
reverse
by
this
court.
thank
you.
mr.
robert
b.
collins
excuse
me
your
honor,
i
though
i
had
a
minute.
i’m
--
mr.
robert
b.
collins
i
have
only
about
two
or
three
sentences,
your
honor.
may
it
please
the
court.
in
reply
to
mr.
justice
white’s
question
about
the
constitution,
we
definitely
do
think
it’s
a
constitutional
allocation
of
power
and
that
the
establishment
of
the
reservation
is
all
the
federal
government
formal
involvement
necessary,
i
think
mr.
sachse
said
that.
the
leahy
case
and
other
oklahoma
cases
are
in
oklahoma
where
there
is
a
law
like
public
law
280
and
has
been
and
was
at
that
time
in
the
leahy
case
committing
jurisdiction
to
the
states.
it
wasn’t
the
same
as
public
law
280.
it
may
not
have
the
same
scope
but
it
certainly
doesn’t
apply
to
the
navajos.
and
finally
--
mr.
robert
b.
collins
it
was
on
a
mineral
share
from
an
allotment
i
believe,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
b.
collins
well,
your
honor,
it’s
on
what’s
called
the
osage
mineral
shares
which
had
been
ruled
be
personal
property
of
the
individual
indian.
i
agree
that
they
are
formally
shares
in
the
tribe’s
mineral
income
but
the
shares
are
inheritable
by
one
indian
from
another.
mr.
robert
b.
collins
and
finally,
one
more
sentence,
excuse
me.
mr.
robert
b.
collins
yes,
your
honor
that’s
correct.
mr.
robert
b.
collins
that
--
that’s
our
point,
your
honor,
that
the
oklahoma
situation
has
no
application
here
because
it’s
subject
to
special
laws
that
don’t
apply
to
arizona
and
--
mr.
robert
b.
collins
i
agree
with
that
your
honor.
i
had
one
more
sentence
which
is
that,
this
court
and
--
we
contended
as
an
order
and
granted
decision,
this
court
has
construed
public
law
280
to
be
ruling
in
this
case
and
the
kennerly
case.
i
don’t
have
time
to
go
into
that
but
it’s
in
the
briefs.
thank
you.
mr.
robert
b.
collins
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
appeal
from
the
state
courts
of
arizona
where
appellant
filed
suit
to
recover
state
income
tax
withheld
from
her
income.
she
claims
that
the
state
has
no
jurisdiction
to
collect
its
state
income
tax
from
her
on
a
ground
that
she
is
a
navajo
indian
who
at
all
relevant
times
live
and
worked
within
the
boundaries
of
navajo
indian
reservation.
the
state
courts
of
arizona
denied
her
claim
despite
an
unbroken
line
of
decisions
by
this
court
that
states
have
no
jurisdiction
over
the
reservation
affairs
of
indians.
this
court
first
interpreted
the
constitutional
relationship
between
the
states
and
indian
tribes
in
1982
in
the
case
of
worcester
against
georgia.
mr.
chief
justice
marshall’s
opinion
reviews
in
detail
the
constitutional
provisions
that
relate
to
indians
and
concludes
that
plain
area
authority
over
indian
is
conferred
by
the
constitution
on
the
federal
government
and
at
state
laws
can
have
no
force
or
effect
on
indian
reservations.
subsequent
decisions
of
this
court
modified
that
decision
in
one
area
where
the
referrals
of
non-indians
only
are
involved
on
an
indian
reservation
and
where
the
indians
were
not
directly
involved
at
all.
in
addition,
congress
has
exercised
its
plain
area
authority
on
certain
occasions
to
grant
to
the
states
authority
over
reservation
indians.
mr.
robert
b.
collins
your
honor,
the
actual
amount
of
tax
that
appellant
sought
to
regain
was
$16.20.
mr.
robert
b.
collins
your
honor,
she
filed
the
action
as
a
class
action
that
never
reached
any
decision
as
to
whether
it
was
properly
a
class
action
under
state
procedures
in
the
state
of
arizona.
i’m
sure
that
the
court
decision
bears
on
--
on
thousands
of
indians
in
the
state
of
arizona.
arizona
nearly
a
hundred
thousand
indians,
most
of
them
live
on
reservations.
i
think
it
affects
them
all.
mr.
robert
b.
collins
i
don’t
believe
so,
your
honor
because
the
matter
was
decided
on
the
motion
o
dismiss.
the
complaint
stands
alone
as
an
allegation
of
fact.
she
works
for
a
bank
on
the
reservation.
i
don’t
know
that
--
that’s
in
the
record.
mr.
robert
b.
collins
no,
your
honor.
the
tribe
has
a
sales
--
when
effect
to
sales
tax,
but
has
no
income
tax.
mr.
robert
b.
collins
the
decisions
of
this
court
where
summed
up
in
the
only
treaties
on
indian
law
ever
produced
by
mr.
felix
cohen
in
1942.
he
stated,
“state
laws
generally
are
not
applicable
to
tribal
indians
on
an
indian
reservation
except
for
congress
as
expressly
provided
that
state
law
shall
apply.
it
follows
the
indians
and
indian
property
on
an
indian
reservation,
are
not
subject
to
state
taxation,
except
by
virtue
of
an
expressed
authority
conferred
upon
the
state
by
act
of
congress.”
it
is
our
contention
that
rule
applies
here
that
arizona
has
acted
in
contravention
of
that
rule
and
that
this
court
should
reverse
on
that
account.
now
that
rule
doesn’t
apply
to
all
indians.
there
are
indians
who
were
never
placed
under
federal
protection,
never
got
a
reservation.
there
are
other
indians
over
whom
the
federal
protection
has
been
ended
by
congress
beginning
with
oklahoma
in
the
late
19th
century.
but,
the
navajos
are
still
fully
under
federal
protection.
in
1868,
united
states
entered
into
a
treaty
with
the
navajos
under
which
the
navajos
agreed
to
peace
under
the
protection
of
united
states
and
the
reservation
was
set
aside
for
their
exclusive
use.
the
treaty
specifically
provides
that
outsiders
cannot
enter
the
reservation
without
permission
of
the
navajos
with
the
exception
of
federal
agents.
in
1912,
44
years
later
arizona
was
admitted
to
the
union.
however,
the
united
states
honored
is
treaty
commitment
to
the
navajos
by
conditioning
that
admission
in
the
arizona
enabling
act
on
the
expressed
ground
that
arizona
agreed
the
reservations
indian
affairs
remain
under
the
exclusive
control
of
congress.
in
1949,
congress
passed
a
bill
which
would
have
ceded
concurrent
authority
over
reservation
indians
in
arizona
to
--
over
the
navajos
to
the
state
of
arizona.
but
president
truman
vetoed
the
bill
expressly
because
he
objected
to
that
provision,
and
today
the
navajos
have
a
comprehensive
tribe
government
which
rules
territory
in
three
different
states.
it
has
a
full
court
system
that
adjudicates
all
civil
matters
arising
between
indians
on
the
reservation
and
all
misdemeanors
as
to
indians
on
the
reservation.
it
has
an
appellate
court
the
rules
as
to
questions
of
law
as
does
this
court.
it
has
a
bar
with
navajo
advocates
who
practice
before
the
courts.
it
has
its
own
police
system.
it
has
many
regularity
functions
that
deal
with
the
things
that
the
--
are
important
to
the
navajo
people
such
as
stock
raising,
business
licensing,
and
alike.
a
long
list
of
regularity
services
are
provided
by
state
government
--
by
the
tribal
government
that
are
comfortable
to
those
provided
by
state
and
local
government
elsewhere.
we
detail
this
in
our
reply
brief
and
it
does
tax
its
people.
there
is
a
gross
receipts
tax
on
sales
on
the
reservation
in
effect
to
sale
tax.
the
governmental
functions
on
the
reservation
that
are
not
tribal
are
by
enlarged
federal.
all
healthcares
delivered
by
the
federal
government
to
the
united
states
public
health
service.
roads
are
built
by
federal
government
and
so
forth.
the
navajos
are
poor
the
federal
services
are
important
to
them
at
this
time.
now,
we
have
argued
three
grounds
independent
legal
grounds
for
reversal
of
this
case.
i
intend
to
address
myself
essentially
to
one
of
them.
the
one
set
out
really
in
mr.
cohen’s
role
that
i
recited
earlier.
that
this
--that
dispute
focuses
on
the
1959
decision
of
this
court
in
williams
against
lee.
that
case
also
involved
the
navajo
indians.
in
that
case,
a
non-indian
brought
suit
against
a
navajo
couple
in
the
state
courts
of
arizona
based
on
a
reservation
incurred
debt.
the
navajos
moved
to
dismiss
in
the
ground
that
the
tribal
government
alone
had
jurisdiction
over
the
cause
of
action.
the
arizona
supreme
court
denied
that
claim
ruling
that
because
no
act
of
congress
expressly
forbad
the
state
court
jurisdiction.
the
state
court
must
have
jurisdiction.
that’s
the
very
claim
arizona
makes
here.
we
are
just
having
a
renewal
of
the
same
dispute.
in
that
case,
this
court
reversed,
unanimously
reversed
the
arizona
supreme
court
in
an
opinion
which
forcefully
renewed
the
federal
protection
over
reservation
indian
governments.
this
court
referred
to
the
treaty
between
the
navajo
people
and
the
federal
government
in
these
terms,
“implicit
in
this
treaty
terms
was
the
understanding
that
the
internal
affairs
of
the
indians
remain
exclusively
within
the
jurisdiction
of
whatever
tribal
government
existed.”
now,
the
court
went
on
to
acknowledge
that
decisions
of
this
court
had
applied
state
laws
in
indian
reservations
to
the
affairs
of
non-indians
and
recited
the
cases
were
that
have
been
done.
and
to
that
extent
that
the
old
case
of
worcester
against
georgia
had
been
modified.
however,
in
the
very
same
sentence,
the
court
said,
“the
basic
policy
of
worcester
has
remained.”
in
other
words,
the
policy
that
the
affairs
of
the
indians
themselves
on
the
reservation
are
under
exclusively
federal
and
tribal
authority.
this
court
also
emphasized
the
meticulous
control
which
congress
has
exercised
over
the
years
of
the
reservation
indian
affairs.
the
court
stated
that
congress
had
acted
consistently
upon
the
assumption
that
the
states
have
no
power
to
regulate
indian
affairs
on
reservations
and
that
when
congress
has
wished
the
states
to
exercise
the
power,
it
is
granted
them
the
jurisdiction
which
worcester
against
georgia
denied
the
states.
now,
in
the
phase
of
this
unbroken
string
of
decisions,
the
arizona
court
below
essentially
tried
to
avoid
the
affect
of
the
decision
on
two
grounds.
first,
the
court
below
dealt
with
this
court’s
decision
in
williams
against
lee
by
distinguishing
--
creating
a
distinction
i
would
say
between
the
affairs
of
the
navajo
tribe
and
the
affairs
of
individual
navajo
indians.
the
court
seems
to
say
that
if
the
state
invasion
does
not
cripple
the
tribal
government,
that
is
okay.
however,
this
court
has,
in
many
occasions
ruled
that
affairs
of
individual
indians
on
reservations
are
subject
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
tribe
and
not
the
states.
in
the
kansas
indians
a
19th
century
case,
this
court
expressly
ruled
that
the
state
of
kansas
could
not
tax
individual
indians
--
in
the
state
--
in
that
state.
the
affairs
of
the
tribe
were
not
involved
at
all.
mr.
robert
b.
collins
that
was
a
property
tax,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
b.
collins
yes.
in
a
much
more
recent
case,
i
think
they
were
both
personal
and
real
property
in
that
case.
in
a
much
more
recent
case,
in
kennerly
against
district
court
of
montana,
the
montana
district
court,
excuse
me,
the
montana
supreme
court
made
the
same
sort
of
ruling.
it
said
that
a
personal
debt
of
an
individual
indian
is
not
a
tribal
affair.
this
court
overruled
that
decision
in
this
court’s
opinion
in
kennerly
against
district
court
of
montana.
and
of
course,
williams
against
lee
itself
really
involved
the
personal
affairs
on
an
indiana.
the
tribe
wasn’t
a
party
to
the
case.
all
the
tribe
did
was
provided
a
court
where
the
navajo
contended
the
manner
should
have
been
heard.
now,
the
--
the
language
in
this
court’s
opinion
in
williams
against
lee
that
arizona
relies
on
is
what
the
briefs
refer
to
as
the
infringement
test.
in
reads
the
question
has
always
been
whether
the
state
action
infringed
on
the
right
of
reservation
indians
to
make
their
own
laws
and
be
ruled
by
them.
we
suggest
that
arizona
has
badly
distorted
the
meaning
of
that
phrase.
of
course,
the
phrase
begins
with
the
question
has
always
been.
it
is
not
a
new
rule.
in
other
words,
the
court
was
referring
to
the
time
honored
rule
that
reservation
indians
are
entitled
to
govern
their
own
affairs.
furthermore,
the
court
state
makes
their
own
laws
and
be
ruled
by
them.
we
suggest
what
that
means
is,
the
laws
that
indians
make
rule
rather
than
state
laws.
now
--
mr.
robert
b.
collins
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
b.
collins
there
will
be
shortly,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
b.
collins
there
has,
i
believe
one
--
one
occasion
that
i
know
about.
they
may
have
been
more.
mr.
robert
b.
collins
yes,
sir.
that
convinced
us.
mr.
robert
b.
collins
that’s
--
that’s
correct.
they
do
participate
in
the
state
government
and
there
is
a
certain
amount
of
interaction
between
reservation
affairs
and
state
affairs
that
has
been
authorized
by
congress.
our
contention
is
it’s
up
to
congress
to
adjust
that
relationship.
it’s
not
up
to
arizona
that
whenever
congress
has
wanted
to
adjust
that
relationship,
it
is
done
so
in
detail.
congress
has
specifically
said
that
states
can
--
can
levy
certain
taxes
against
reservation
indians,
but
not
the
tax
that’s
as
issue
here.
and
we
suggest
that
that
congress
i
think
can
be
appealed
to
with
any
question
of
adjustment
of
the
relationship.
now
--
mr.
robert
b.
collins
yes,
your
honor.
they
didn’t
vote
because
they
weren’t
considered
citizens.
mr.
robert
b.
collins
that’s
--
that’s
correct.
the
indian
citizenship
was
granted
by
act
of
congress
in
1924,
but
since
that
time
this
court
has
repeatedly
rule
on
the
question
of
federal
protection
over
indians
and
has
repeatedly
rejected
the
contention
that
citizenship
ends
the
protection.
it
is
up
to
congress
to
end
it
specifically
and
it
hasn’t
been
done
implicitly
in
some
act
like
the
citizenship
act.
the
--
now
the
--
a
subsequent
decision
of
this
court
in
organized
village
of
kake
against
egan,
had
a
sentence
in
it
which
paraphrase
some
of
the
decisions
of
this
court
in
earlier
decisions
of
this
court
including
williams
against
lee.
and
that
sentence
has
also
been
seized
upon
by
the
arizona
court
and
some
other
state
courts
in
an
effort
to
infer
the
somehow
the
door
is
open
to
state
application
of
their
laws
on
indian
reservations.
we
suggest
that
that
sentence
has
been
taken
out
of
context
and
misread.
the
kake
case
involved
indians
not
on
a
reservation
who
had
no
comprehensive
tribal
government
that
did
not
rule
any
distinct
territory
and
therefore
was
quite
different
from
a
navajos.
and
i
think
that
--
mr.
robert
b.
collins
if
the
indian
income
earned
off
the
reservation,
your
honor,
i
think
that
the
question
would
be
one
of
what
sometimes
turn
taxing
--
termed
taxing
jurisdiction,
a
due
process
issue.
mr.
robert
b.
collins
i
think
it
would
depend
on
the
particular
facts.
taxing
jurisdiction
decisions
to
go
into
the
question
of
a
benefit
burden
theory
of
taxation,
how
much
services
are
received
and
that
sort
of
thing.
i
think
there
such
--
mr.
robert
b.
collins
no
sir.
i
would
not.
mr.
robert
b.
collins
i
think
that
--
i
think
that
the
indians
based
on
the
argument
i’m
making
here
would
be
entitled
to
the
same
kind
of
considerations
as
prevailed
in
--
in
other
cases
where
courts
have
considered
taxing
jurisdiction
over
nine
residents
essentially.
that
kind
of
situation,
i
think
those
kinds
of
issues
would
govern
that
--that
situation.
mr.
robert
b.
collins
no,
your
honor,
not
at
all.
if
the
tribal
member
leaves
off
the
reservation
he
is
subject
to
state
jurisdiction.
i
think
that
settled
long.
we’re
not
--we’re
not
suggesting
otherwise.
mr.
robert
b.
collins
well,
that
–
that
that
just
turns
around
the
taxing
jurisdiction
question.
that
makes
the
tribe
have
to
justify
its
taxing
jurisdiction,
i
think,
if
that
occurred.
but
those
--
those
cases
involved
the
interaction
of
two
taxing
jurisdictions
in
the
way
where
we
have
--
you
know
city’s
taxing
commuters
and
that
kind
of
question
of
taxing
jurisdiction.
there
is
a
discussion
of
that
issue
and
one
of
the
amicus
briefs,
but
i
don’t
think
it’s
relevant
to
the
main
question
here.
mr.
robert
b.
collins
the
state
furnishes
a
very
minor
amount
of
services
to
the
tribe,
your
honor.
i
lived
in
window
rock
on
the
reservation
and
the
schools
there
--this
is
not
in
the
record
your
honor,
but
it
--
if
this
is
a
relevant
issue
we
pointed
out,
the
matter
should
be
remanded
because
it
is
not
a
record
as
to
either
side.
but,
i
lived
in
window
rock,
the
school
budget
in
our
school
district
where
i
live
is
about
20%
state
supported.
mr.
robert
b.
collins
well,
that
is
a
matter
of
decision
of
law
in
arizona.
there
is
a
decision
of
the
arizona
courts
that
reservation
indians
can
vote
in
the
state
and
that
--
that
is
cited
in
the
briefs.
but,
i’d
say
it
may
be
10%
of
the
support
for
education
on
the
reservation
comes
in
state
sources
overall,
perhaps
10%
of
the
source
of
welfare
money.
that’s
about
it.
there
aren’t
many
other
state
services
of
any
significance
on
the
reservation
and
furthermore,
those
reservations
schools
are
educating
non-indians.
i
mean
i
could
have
children
on
reservation
schools
and
i
pay
state
taxes.
this
issue
doesn’t
concern
me.
mr.
robert
b.
collins
there
is
a
real
property
tax
levy,
your
honor,
that’s
local.
there
are
real
property
interests
on
the
reservation
that
are
taxable.
indian
mineral
production
is
taxable
under
the
state
system
and
apache
county
administered
that,
but
the
source
of
money
is
all
under
reservation.
there
isn’t
any
money
that
comes
from
off
the
reservations
supporting
reservations
schools
from
apache
county.
mr.
robert
b.
collins
yes,
it
does
your
honor.
if
you
mean
in
the
sense
that
apache
county
derives
money
from
reservation
resources
and
reapplies
it
for
reservation?
yes,
that’s
correct.
i
think
that
the
importance
of
the
difference
between
this
case
and
the
court’s
decision
in
organized
village
of
kake
against
egan
is
shown
by
the
fact
that
later
on,
this
court
ruled
in
warren
trading
post
company
against
arizona
tax
commission
that
again
the
navajos
are
entitled
to
self-government.
there
were
other
issues
in
that
case,
but
the
court
distinctly
renewed
the
commitment
to
the
protection
of
the
navajos
government
and
of
course
the
supreme
court
of
minnesota
has
ruled
contrary
to
the
arizona
courts
in
a
decision
that
we
think
was
correct.
i
think
that
the
--
an
important
point
is
to
consider
the
implications
of
the
state’s
position
here
on
indians
themselves.
first
of
all,
the
state’s
position,
have
they
acknowledged
that
williams
against
lee
is
right,
they
have
too.
it’s
a
decision
of
this
court.
once
it’s
going
--
they
haven’t
contended
so
far
that
it
should
be
overruled.
now,
that
means
that
sometimes
they
don’t
have
jurisdiction
to
apply
their
laws
under
reservation.
now,
they
say
sometimes
they
do
and
we
have
a
constitutional
question
each
time
you
decide.
obviously,
this
is
very
productive
of
litigation.
i
mean
each
case
has
to
be
taken
to
an
appellate
decision.
well
that’s
not
too
serious
a
problem,
but
consider
the
situation,
the
uncertainty
that’s
created
for
reservation
indian.
merely
sitting
there
and
he
receives
a
letter
from
some
state
bureau
in
phoenix
that
tells
him
he
must
do
something
because
state
law
requires
it.
and
he
has
to
decide
whether
that
state
law
under
constitutional
principles
that
they
suggest
to
apply
--
conflicts
with
his
tribal
law
in
some
way
or
other.
well,
that
uncertainty
seems
to
me
to
be
not
warranted.
i
don’t
think
this
court
intended
to
create
that
kind
of
uncertainty
when
it
decided
williams
against
lee
and
that’s
why
we
contend
that
williams
against
lee
has
been
misread.
we
suggests
--
mr.
robert
b.
collins
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
b.
collins
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
at
the
time
we
adjourned,
i
was
pointing
out
that
the
implications
of
arizona’s
position
create
great
uncertainty
for
reservation
indians.
each
indian
must
decide
that
his
peril
whether
his
particular
situation
--
in
a
particular
situation
applied
to
him
whether
the
state
law
that’s
being
applied
conflicts
with
tribal
authority.
and
the
third
implication
of
the
state’s
position
is
that
under
the
word
state
views
this
law.
the
state
can
pick
and
choose
when
to
come
on
to
the
reservation.
we
see
them
trying
to
tax
where
it’s
to
their
advantage.
congress
offered
the
states
in
public
law
280
the
opportunity
to
assume
a
broad
range
of
jurisdiction
of
some
sort.
in
return
the
states
were
to
assume
certain
burden
such
as
the
burdens
of
manning
the
courts
and
police
that
had
been
born
by
the
indians
in
the
federal
government.
it’s
clear
that
the
congress’
intent
was
that
the
--
that
the
burden
of
these
services
be
born
by
the
state
and
arizona
is
attempting
an
avoidance
of
that
--
of
that
intent
of
congress.
mr.
robert
b.
collins
justice
rehnquist,
the
--
that
question
i’m
fully
aware
is
the
central
question
of
the
case
to
follow
this
one
and
i’m
not
certain
the
full
reaches
of
public
law
280.
since
it
is
going
to
be
fully
argued
by
competent
counsel
in
that
case,
i
prefer
not
to
comment
on.
but
it
just
seems
to
me
clear
that
in
the
absence
of
compliance
with
public
law
280,
it’s
absolutely,
(inaudible)
the
jurisdiction
to
tax.
the
full
reach
of
that
act
is
important
question
and
--
mr.
robert
b.
collins
i
think
that
if
--
i
think
that
what
congress
does
is
congress
in
by
virtue
of
its
protection
of
the
indians
provides
substantial
services
are
quite
large
services
which
are
detailed
in
this
court’s
opinion
in
warren
trading
post
company
against
arizona
tax
commission.
but
congress
has
suggested
in
certain
cases,
public
law
280
is
one
example
on
the
termination
laws
in
the
1950
or
another
that
federal
protection
be
withdrawn,
but
that
leaves
the
indians
as
ordinary
citizens
of
the
state
with
no
federal
protection,
no
federal
services,
that
means
the
states
have
to
provide
normal
services
to
them
that
they
are
not
now
providing.
in
that
sense,
the
congress
can
impose
the
duty
on
that
states,
yes.
mr.
robert
b.
collins
your
honor,
i
think
that
--
i
think
that
the
economic
relationship
between
the
tribes
and
the
states
is
controlled
by
congress.
i
think
on
the
other
hand,
congress
has
made
indian
citizens
of
the
states
and
they
are
entitled
to
the
right
of
citizens.
this
has
gotten
into
detail
in
our
reply
brief
to
which
i
refer
for
a
complete
answer,
but
our
position
is
that
there
might
be
some
question
about
that.
the
federal
government
provides
broad
services
if
those
were
withdrawn,
the
equities
might
be
grossly
altered,
but
everything
stands
the
states
provide
very
good
services
to
the
navajos.
the
state
has
limited
taxing
authority
for
the
navajos.
the
economic
thing
is
in
pretty
balance.
i
think
the
state
is
trying
to
upset
that.
i
think
that
if
a
radical
change
were
coming
and
has
to
come
from
the
federal
government
because
it’s
the
federal
government
that
is
providing
the
services
to
keep
that
economic
situation
in
balance.
and
it’s
up
to
congress
to
change
this.
it’s
up
to
congress
to
order
the
arrangement.
but
i
do
answer
question,
yes.
i
think
that
they
are
citizen
of
the
states
and
entitled
to
the
rights
of
citizens.
mr.
robert
b.
collins
i
think
preemption
would
be
the
proper
word,
your
honor,
yes.
mr.
robert
b.
collins
i
think
the
thrust
of
--
mr.
robert
b.
collins
no,
your
honor.
i
think
it’s
the
constitution.
i
think
that
worcester
against
georgia
rules
that
under
the
constitution,
indians
affairs
are
preempted
by
the
federal
government.
now,
the
courts
have
subsequently
ruled
--
mr.
robert
b.
collins
no,
sir.
congress
can
--
i
agree
with
that.
congress
has
the
power
to
see
jurisdiction
of
the
states
and
has
repeatedly
and
in
detailed
then
so,
i
think
mr.
sachse
for
the
united
states
is
going
to
elaborate
on
some
of
the
particular
laws
that
are
relevant
here,
but
--
mr.
robert
b.
collins
i
believe,
your
honor
that
–
that
the
court’s
opinions
have
referred
to
several
constitutional
provisions.
the
indian
commerce
clause,
the
treaty
power
and
supremacy
clause
are
combined
leading
to
the
rule
of
worcester
against
georgia.
mr.
robert
b.
collins
state
inheritance
taxes,
yes
i
would.
mr.
robert
b.
collins
non-reservation
indians
and
indians
receiving
full
services
from
the
state
where
involved
in
those
cases
and
that’s
--
that’s
all
the
difference
in
the
world,
if
they’re
not
on
reservation,
they’re
not
entitled
to
the
protection
of
the
federal
treaty
and
so
forth.
mr.
robert
b.
collins
a
few
i
think,
in
very
small
reservations,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
b.
collins
i
think
that
it’s
open
to
contention
that
some
of
this
court’s
decisions
have
depended
on
their
being
a
tribal
government
in
existence.
i’m
not
sure
how
they
would
apply
it.
it
happens
in
fact
that
most
of
the
small
reservations
are
now
under
public
law
280
and
are
governed
by
that
law
specifically.
arizona
has
never
complied
with
public
law
280
and
the
states
that
have
not
are
ones
are
states
with
large
reservation
with
tribal
departments
by
enlarge.
so,
i’m
not
sure
that
question
exist
in
reality,
but
--
mr.
robert
b.
collins
yes,
your
honor,
it
definitely
does.
i
mean
the
navajo
tribe
is
quite
interested
in
this
case
to
file
a
brief
in
support
of
the
jurisdiction
--
mr.
robert
b.
collins
it
might
be.
i
would
suppose
it
might
be.
i’m
not
sticking
it
if
the
--
that’s
the
question
i
can’t
answer
definitely.
in
conclusion,
we
just
--
we
want
to
urge
that
we’re
not
asking
for
a
change
on
the
law.
we’re
asking
that
this
court
reaffirmed
it’s
historic
commitment
to
the
self-government
indian
reservations
and
further
more
that
this
court
and
the
uncertainty
that
has
been
created
by
what
arizona
has
done
in
a
couple
of
other
states
in
trying
to
interpret
other
decisions
of
this
court
as
allowing
this
invasion
of
the
indian
jurisdiction.
we’re
talking
about
what
we
contend
is
a
settled
area
of
jurisprudence.
the
prior
decisions
of
this
court
and
acts
of
congress
make
it
clear
that
the
arizona
court
below
was
wrong
and
should
be
reverse
by
this
court.
thank
you.
mr.
robert
b.
collins
excuse
me
your
honor,
i
though
i
had
a
minute.
i’m
--
mr.
robert
b.
collins
i
have
only
about
two
or
three
sentences,
your
honor.
may
it
please
the
court.
in
reply
to
mr.
justice
white’s
question
about
the
constitution,
we
definitely
do
think
it’s
a
constitutional
allocation
of
power
and
that
the
establishment
of
the
reservation
is
all
the
federal
government
formal
involvement
necessary,
i
think
mr.
sachse
said
that.
the
leahy
case
and
other
oklahoma
cases
are
in
oklahoma
where
there
is
a
law
like
public
law
280
and
has
been
and
was
at
that
time
in
the
leahy
case
committing
jurisdiction
to
the
states.
it
wasn’t
the
same
as
public
law
280.
it
may
not
have
the
same
scope
but
it
certainly
doesn’t
apply
to
the
navajos.
and
finally
--
mr.
robert
b.
collins
it
was
on
a
mineral
share
from
an
allotment
i
believe,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
b.
collins
well,
your
honor,
it’s
on
what’s
called
the
osage
mineral
shares
which
had
been
ruled
be
personal
property
of
the
individual
indian.
i
agree
that
they
are
formally
shares
in
the
tribe’s
mineral
income
but
the
shares
are
inheritable
by
one
indian
from
another.
mr.
robert
b.
collins
and
finally,
one
more
sentence,
excuse
me.
mr.
robert
b.
collins
yes,
your
honor
that’s
correct.
mr.
robert
b.
collins
that
--
that’s
our
point,
your
honor,
that
the
oklahoma
situation
has
no
application
here
because
it’s
subject
to
special
laws
that
don’t
apply
to
arizona
and
--
mr.
robert
b.
collins
i
agree
with
that
your
honor.
i
had
one
more
sentence
which
is
that,
this
court
and
--
we
contended
as
an
order
and
granted
decision,
this
court
has
construed
public
law
280
to
be
ruling
in
this
case
and
the
kennerly
case.
i
don’t
have
time
to
go
into
that
but
it’s
in
the
briefs.
thank
you.
