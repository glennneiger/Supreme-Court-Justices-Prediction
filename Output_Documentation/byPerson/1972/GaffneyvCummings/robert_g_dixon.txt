mr.
robert
g.
dixon,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
direct
appeal
from
a
three-judge
district
court
in
connecticut
which
invalidated
the
official
state
legislative
enforcement
plan.
we
appear
here
in
defense
of
that
official
state
plan.
the
plan
was
devised
by
a
bipartisan
board
of
three
members
including
a
tie-breaker
under
the
state
constitution
which
constitution
thereby
tries
to
incorporate
an
anti-gerrymandering
spirit
in
the
very
reprocess
of
the
apportionment
activity.
the
plan
of
the
board
was
subjected
to
litigation
promptly
in
both
state
and
federal
court.
the
federal
court
denied
a
plea
of
extension
and
on
april
4,
1972,
he
did
invalidate
that
plan.
an
appeal
was
promptly
taken
and
also
a
submission
of
a
motion
for
a
stay
order,
the
motion
was
referred
by
mr.
justice
marshall
to
the
court
and
on
june
12,
1972,
this
court
stayed
the
adverse
district
court
judgment.
that
had
two
effects.
one
was
to
bar
implementation
of
a
master’s
plan
which
had
been
under
preparation,
under
now
stayed
judgment
and
more
importantly
perhaps
and
also
on
the
way
for
conducting
the
1972
election
of
state
legislators
in
connecticut
under
the
official
state
plan,
that
was
done.
along
the
way,
there
was
a
supplementary
mandamus
action
in
state
court
to
clarify
one
or
two
clerical
errors.
the
claim
was
reviewed
by
the
state
court
and
the
state
supreme
court
found
that
no
constitutional
impediment
under
the
state
constitution
to
use
of
the
state
plan.
the
large
question
therefore
here
is
whether
connecticut
can
continue
the
use
of
this
official
state
reinforcement
plan,
gerrymander
of
the
1970
decade.
in
a
more
precise
fashion,
the
federal
issues
are
three,
population
equality,
justification
of
deviations
as
such
be
needed
and
the
plaintiff-appellees’
allegations
of
gerrymandering.
turning
first
to
the
population
issue,
we
assert,
and
most
strongly
assert
that
trivial
deviations
of
the
sort
in
connecticut
and
i’ll
mention
those
in
a
second,
trivial
deviations
present
no
prima
facie
case.
therefore,
the
plan
would
remain
presumptively
constitutional
unless
plaintiff-appellees
could
introduce
proof
of
a
non-population
nature
of
discrimination.
we
think
that
a
concept
of
a
presumptive
constitutionality
concept
keyed
to
a
lack
of
a
prima
facie
case,
if
there
are
trivial
deviations
is
implicit
in
swann
against
adams,
and
was
not
settled
in
swann
against
adams
and
is
implicit
in
the
dissented
opinions
in
kirkpatrick
against
preisler.
what
are
these
connecticut
deviations
which
we
find
so
trivial?
in
percentage
terms,
the
most
deviant
district
from
ideal
in
the
connecticut
senate
deviates
by
only
0.9%.
for
the
lower
house,
most
deviant
district
from
ideal
deviates
by
only
3.9%.
over
these
percentage
terms,
must
be
put
in
a
context
of
the
size
of
the
district
being
created
to
become
meaningful
and
likewise
the
available
census
data
we
look
to
the
census
data.
we
find
that
the
most
deviant
district
in
either
house
in
connecticut
deviates
from
ideal
by
fewer
than
800
census-persons,
for
the
lower
house,
789,
for
the
senate
787.
you
might
well
ask
if
the
population
deviation
in
real
census
terms
is
identical
virtually
why
a
percentage
--
or
the
percentages
is
so
different,
the
answer
is
in
the
size
of
the
districts.
connecticut
has
36
state
senate
seats,
average
population,
84,000
roughly,
800
population
deviants,
census
body
is
deviant
on
that
base
because
there’s
only
0.9%
deviation.
connecticut
has
151
assembly
districts,
average
population
about
20,000
on
that
base
the
same
trivial
800
person
deviation,
gives
you
only
a
--
since
they
raise
the
percent
deviation
to
a
3.9%.
in
terms
of
the
census
data
which
was
the
building
unit
for
the
apportionment
board
of
the
2,700
census
units
available
to
the
board,
88%
in
exceed
400
in
census
population
and
yet
the
average
deviation
in
connecticut
in
either
house
is
under
400.
by
contrast,
howell
against
mahan
--
mahan
against
howell
last
week,
excuse
me,
the
most
deviant
district
from
ideal
was
i
believe
was
about
4,400.
the
figures
of
the
connecticut
type,
we
suggest
are
really
on
target
in
the
reynolds
against
sims
sense
of
substantial
equality
or
of
not
--
or
in
showing
that
the
vote
of
each
voter
in
a
state,
be
approximate
or
equal
to
that
of
any
other
on
target
and
therefore
constitute
no
dilution
of
voting
power.
hence
we
suggest
that
this
case
could
fit
the
general
principle
of
treating
trivial
deviations
of
this
sort
as
constituting
no
prima
facie
case
of
dilution
of
voting
power
as
being
presumptively
constitutional.
more
precisely
and
we’ve
suggest
this
for
connecticut
and
not
for
the
nation
necessarily
about
a
rule
if
we
divide
as
follows
for
connecticut
making
more
precise
this
presumptive
constitutionality
concept.
it
could
run
this
way
that
where
the
maximum
deviation
in
census
population
terms,
actual
census
bodies
in
a
district,
in
most
deviant
district,
in
a
state
plan
is
less
than
the
average
population
of
the
census
units
being
constructed,
that
plan
should
be
presumptively
constitutional.
and
the
average
population
of
the
census
units
in
connecticut
is
1,100,
the
median
unit,
census
unit
is
1,000.
and
as
i
said
the
most
deviant
actual
district
from
ideal
is
only
800.
without
such
a
presumptive
constitutionality
rule
keyed
to
lack
of
showing
a
prima
facie
case
with
trivial
deviations
of
this
sort,
we
feel
the
courts
remain
not
only
in
the
business
of
stirring
up
the
political
thicket,
that
plaintiff
instigation
that
may
take
up
residence
in
a
permanent
basis
in
the
political
thicket.
why
do
we
say
this?
because
plaintiffs
can
always
show
a
slightly
less
deviant
plan
then
laboriously
constructed
official
state
plan
at
any
given
level
of
the
percentage
deviation.
with
a
hand
calculator,
you
could
device
hundreds
of
plans,
each
one
though
having
a
quite
different
political
effect
because
no
district
line
is
neutral.
lower
courts
have
tended
to
follow
this
approach
in
the
past.
in
fact
we’re
having
a
past
and
we’re
still
today
to
an
extent
a
one
body
better
rule.
that
is
plaintiff’s
comment
with
the
plan
often
to
the
last
minute
at
trial
perhaps
showing
their
own
self
serving
plan,
just
no
statewide
input
in
it,
showing
it
is
one
body
better
so
to
speak
than
the
state
plan
and
if
it
--
that
the
election
is
immanent
and
the
state
cannot
justify
or
hasn’t
built
under
the
--
its
process,
the
state
plan
goes
down
the
drain.
now,
mahan
against
howell
last
week,
that
does
not
solve
this
problem
of
avoiding
casual
invalidations
on
a
one
body
better
rule
because
the
state
which
has
tried
to
be
directly
on
target
and
does
not
crank
into
its
process
any
corollary
rational
state
purposes
than
an
attempt
to
be
directly
on
target
in
population
could
not
qualify
to
utilize
the
mahan
against
howell
justifications
process.
however
with
--
what
we
do
--
i
refer
to
here
is
a
presumptive
constitutionality
rule,
keyed
a
very
low
deviations
of
this
sort,
we
will
achieve
some
legislative
certainty,
the
bodies
can
apportion
without
the
sense
of
futility
as
often
been
the
case
in
the
last
several
years,
litigation
have
been
massive
as
we
all
know
even
after
1970
census.
as
far
as
courts
are
concerned
of
this
approach
a
finding
that
there
is
no
prima
facie
case
with
low
deviations
of
this
sort,
trivial
deviations
would
flush
out
many
petty
cases.
reserved
court
time
for
those
cases
for
justification
does
seem
needed
because
the
size
of
the
deviation
or
for
the
more
complex
issue
of
gerrymandering
if
the
court
proceeds
in
that
direction.
mr.
robert
g.
dixon,
jr.
no.
excuse
me,
i
said
--
mr.
robert
g.
dixon,
jr.
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
robert
g.
dixon,
jr.
i
apologize.
mr.
robert
g.
dixon,
jr.
mr.
justice
stewart,
my
point
was
for
--
was
made
in
general
terms
that
a
state
might
have
only
a
straight
population
purpose,
that
is
not
connecticut.
connecticut
has
three
purposes
to
be
served
in
its
reapportionment
process.
and
we’re
suggesting
that
we
would
not
reach
the
need
to
justify,
shouldn’t
have
reached
the
need
to
justify
until
it
is
first
determined
that
the
deviations
of
a
given
plan
and
i’m
not
talking
about
connecticut
with
its
trivial
deviations,
are
high
enough
to
warrant
constitutional
concern.
mr.
robert
g.
dixon,
jr.
we
fell
that
if
the
deviations
are
smaller,
not
when
deviations
are
smaller
than
the
census
average
population
--
the
average
population
census
unit
is
being
used
that
it
is
really
on
target
and
should
be
declared
constitutional.
mr.
robert
g.
dixon,
jr.
without
getting
to
it,
the
process
justification
is
correct
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
robert
g.
dixon,
jr.
that
would
depend
upon
mr.
justice
stewart,
depend
upon
the
rational
state
policy
at
issue
and
i
think
that
is
an
next
logical
consideration
for
the
connecticut
case.
we
have
sought
not
merely
to
achieve
population
equality
directly
on
target
as
a
pre-eminent
goal
in
order
to
serve
the
overall
purpose
of
fair
and
defect
in
representation.
i
mentioned
several
times
reynolds
against
sims.
we
have
also
added
two
corollary
policies
which
we
think
would
support
this
plan
under
the
decision
of
mahan
against
howell
last
week.
in
short,
if
we
do
not
prevail
on
a
theory
of
presumptive
constitutionality
because
deviations
are
very
trivial,
then
there
are
the
following
justifications
to
be
made.
the
apportionment
board
seeking
close
population
equality
also
had
two
corollary
policies,
a
connecticut
town
policy
and
a
policy
of
political
balance
or
fairness
which
i’ll
define
in
just
a
moment.
now
turning
first
to
the
town
policy
which
is
the
analogue
of
the
no-county
line
policy
in
mahan
against
howell
last
week,
we
find
that
where
virginia
could
honor
that
fully
and
still
stay
inside
a
top
to
bottom
variation
of
16%.
the
connecticut
sought
to
honor
its
town
--
its
no-town
line
cut
fully
for
the
lower
house,
it
does
not
apply
to
the
senate
but
for
the
lower
house.
the
population
deviations
would
reach
a
111%
if
we
bring
forth
the
1965
plan,
and
cut
no-town
lines
and
test
it
out
under
the
1970
census.
110%,
11%
is
way
beyond
howell
against
mahan
even
if
we
think
a
no-cut
policy
is
good.
we
do
think
that
--
an
important
to
note,
the
purposes
lying
behind
is
no
local
division
line
cuts
in
order
to
see
if
they
can
be
served
by
some
other
premises.
mahan
against
howell
last
week,
speaking
of
the
virginia
county
policy,
analogous
to
the
no-cut
policy
in
connecticut,
said
that
it
served
the
purpose
of
furthering
a
political
voice
for
the
counties.
we
see
in
this
a
judicial
recognition
of
community
of
interest
factor
in
representation
that
also
spoke
of
the
no-cut
policy
asserting
an
important
anti-gerrymandering
function.
we
see
in
this
a
judicial
recognition
of
the
danger
of
blind
or
invidious
line
drawing.
the
apportionment
board
in
connecticut
honored
the
town
--
the
no
town
line
cut
policy
substantially.
approximate
3/4
for
the
line
of
the
towns
are
not
cut.
the
board
cut
47
towns
out
of
169.
it
then
--
seeking
to
serve
--
preserve
the
substance
if
not
the
latter
on
all
cut
policy
and
the
purposes
of
political
voice
and
of
anti-gerrymandering
used
a
complementary
policy
of
political
fairness
or
political
balance
which
requires
some
definition.
this
political
balance
or
political
fairness
policy
but
that
is
found.
the
board
with
knowledge
of
public
voting
patterns
in
past
elections
tried
to
divide
equal
population
districts
which
would
and
knowing
out
of
hope
of
avoiding
the
minority
election,
it
actually
occurred
in
1970
in
connecticut
but
would
actually
--
of
our
hope
of
providing
each
party
with
a
seat
gain,
the
legislature
approximately
proportionate
to
its
percent
or
total
of
--
percent
total
of
popular
vote.
now
a
functional
trend
--
you’ll
see
this
is
being
a
vital
arrogant,
anti-gerrymandering
principle
and
an
attempt
to
safeguard
a
political
opportunity
for
effective
political
action
by
all
of
the
voters.
the
essence
of
this
political
fairness
or
political
balance
principle
uses
a
corollary
of
principle
where
they
attempt
to
cut
no
town
lines
and
they
only
cut
3/4,
i
know
it
would
become
--
what
they
felt
with
the
on
target
in
equality
terms.
the
assessment
says,
“a
direct
turning
away
from
a
gerrymandering
purpose,
one
other
result
from
the
plan
that
was
achieved.”
we
think
that
in
regarding
1966
to
1970
election
data,
the
plan
is
conceitedly
fair,
demonstrably
so.
regarding
1972,
we
would
suggest
that
it
is
also
demonstrably
fair,
all
class
before
the
court.district
court,
would’ve
achieved
somewhat
the
same
outcome
in
1972
under
all
plans,
it
would’ve
been
an
excess
seat
gained
for
republican
party.
why?
because
that
was
a
landslide
election
here
in
connecticut
and
past
election
data
in
connecticut
and
indeed
a
civil
law
of
political
science
indicates
that
when
you
have
a
landslide
election,
the
seat
gained
runs
substantially
ahead
of
the
percent
of
the
--
of
vote
cast.
and
also,
the
charts
on
this
point
in
our
reply
brief
indicate
that
the
factor
of
(inaudible)
seats
is
endemic
and
all
the
plans
before
the
district
court
and
the
--
is
no
different
under
the
official
state
plan
than
other
plans.
mr.
robert
g.
dixon,
jr.
mr.
justice
white,
we
find
the
--
we
would
find
in
that
instance
that
we
have
--
presented
to
us
that
issue
of
gerrymandering
whether
or
not
with
the
equality
satisfied,
there
were
nevertheless
because
of
district
pattern
as
mentioned
in
fortson
against
dorsey,
a
substantial
submergence
of
a
political
arrangement
within
the
population
which
had
bring
--
which
would
then
--
mr.
robert
g.
dixon,
jr.
no.
mr.
justice
white,
our
proposition
would
be
this
that
what
is
--
if
a
state
does
not
violate
any
constitutional
requirement
of
the
federal
constitution
by
seeking
a
policy
of
fairness
along
with
a
policy
of
population
equality.
mr.
robert
g.
dixon,
jr.
and
by
political
fairness
in
this
sense
we
do
mean
something
called
political
balance
does
require
consulting
past
election
data
and
testing
out
various
plans
possible
to
see
if
they
would
become
--
would
appear
very
unfair
under
no
bordering
pattern
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
robert
g.
dixon,
jr.
we
could
use
that
term
not
required
by
this
court
--
mr.
robert
g.
dixon,
jr.
yes
mr.
justice
stewart,
that
is
precisely
our
position
here
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
robert
g.
dixon,
jr.
our
position
on
that
is
that
that
is
a
mater
for
plaintiff
proof,
for
plaintiff
attack
on
a
state
plan
and
that
because
gerrymandering
of
an
invidious
sort
is
not
clearly
subject
to
close
policing
by
this
court
yet
an
attempt
to
be
fair
should
not
be
questionable
either.
my
last
point
as
to
mention
the
plaintiff-appellee's
gerrymandering
argument,
they
do
allege
that
the
plan
is
a
gerrymander
of
an
invidious
sense
that
we
see
in
this
record
not
one
iota
of
proof
regarding
the
standards
suggested
in
whitcomb
against
chavis
following
on
that
from
fortson
against
dorsey
for
attacks
on
plans
on
an
impact
basis
rather
than
a
population
basis.
this
court
said
in
whitcomb
that
when
that
kind
of
claim
is
made
there
must
a
showing
that
the
districts
were
conceded
or
operated
as
purposeful
devices
to
further
discrimination,
racial
economic,
you
can
say
a
fortiori
political
fits
that
that
principle
and
the
proof
on
whitcomb
must
be
real
life
proof
of
impact
on
--
in
view
of
voting
power.
so
in
short
we
suggest
that
at
one
level
we
have
a
plan
with
deviation,
somewhat
trivial
that
should
be
deemed
to
be
presumptively
constitutional,
absent
a
gerrymandering
type
proof.
that
is
not
thought
to
be
the
case,
not
figured
enough
and
we’ll
suggest
too
rational
state
policy
to
justify
the
deviations
preserving
as
many
town
lines
as
possible
or
about
3/4
and
also
making
a
good
faith
attempt
to
avoid
unfairness.
and
last
we
find
no
evidence
at
all
here
of
any
overt
invidious
gerrymandering
of
the
sort
which
this
court
has
spoken
of
in
whitcomb
against
chavis
in
similar
cases.
may
it
please
the
court,
i
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
robert
g.
dixon,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
opposing
counsel
stated
yesterday
that
he
had
no
quarrel
with
the
state
plan
regarding
the
senate.
he
attacks
primarily
that
part
of
the
state
plan
regarding
the
house
and
yet,
the
census
body
deviation
for
the
senate
is
identical
with
that
in
the
house.
in
each
case,
match
from
deviation
from
ideal
of
under
800
average
deviation,
under
400,
and
the
median
census
unit
is
1000
in
population.
also
the
same
apportionment
board
process
was
used
including
the
political
fairness
of
principle
for
the
senate
as
in
the
house.
it's
concession
therefore
it
seem
to
remove
all
federal
issues
from
the
house
aspect
of
the
case
too,
with
the
possible
exemption
of
invidious
gerrymandering
within
burden
of
proof
standards
of
whitcomb
against
chavis.
opposing
counsel,
remarked
yesterday
also,
there
were
precedent
cases.
as
we
see
it,
he
failed
to
distinguish
between
the
state
reapportionment
line
of
cases
flowing
from
reynolds,
swann,
to
mahan
and
a
lot
of
gaffney,
from
the
congressional
districting
line
of
cases.
he
seems
to
us
to
be
arguing
for
an
overruling
of
mahan.
we
welcome
mahan
and
simply
seek
to
add
to
it.
now,
yesterday’s
arguments
in
certain
other
cases
in
texas
urged
this
court
to
mandate
political
fairness
or
as
better
phrase
as
equal
political
opportunity
principle
to
mandate
that
under
the
fourteenth
amendment.
that
would
be
a
large
order.
it
might
be
good
depending
upon
the
facts
of
given
case,
but
that
is
not
our
case.
we
do
not
ask
this
court
to
mandate
political
fairness
under
the
fourteenth
amendment.
however,
i
want
to
state
as
in
connecticut
pursues
a
policy,
a
political
fairness
in
a
conscious
anti-gerrymandering
spirit
trying
to
spot
pitfalls
and
avoid
those
pitfalls
in
a
very
process
of
devising
districts
which
might
characterized
as
benevolent,
gerrymandering,
stressing
the
word
benevolent,
purpose
being
to
effectuate
certain
representation
interests,
political,
racial
or
otherwise,
there
is
no
federal
constitutional
impediment.
i
am
returning
now
to
the
aspect
of
the
case
concerning
our
suggestion
of
a
need
for
a
presumptive
constitutionality
rule
key
to
trivial
deviations.
i
suggest
that
as
next
logical
step
after
mahan
against
howell,
acts
as
such
a
rule
could
penalize
a
state
which
has
sought
a
level
of
population
equality
well
within
mahan
against
howell.
but
perhaps,
perhaps
thereby
as
weakened
the
plan’s
connection
with
other
rational
state
policies
which
could
operate
if
needed
at
the
justification
level.
that
circumstance
absent
a
presumptive
constitutionality
rule
key
to
trivial
deviations,
plaintiff
could
more
easily,
quite
easily
perhaps
defeat
the
official
plan
by
simply
offering
his
own
one
body
better
plan
either
at
trial
week
before
--
two
weeks
before
and
upset
a
broadly
constructed
state
plan
of
many
inputs
in
it
of
statewide
nature.
also,
it
would
seem
to
us
that
in
the
context
of
the
kennedy
case,
the
plaintiff’s
plan
should
have
been
before
the
reapportionment
board,
and
not
presented
just
before
trial.
certainly,
on
this
branch
of
the
case,
the
presumptive
constitutionality
rule,
a
state’s
burden
should
not
become
heavier,
with
very
trivial
population
deviations,
then,
the
burden
imposed
on
virginia
in
mahan
against
howell.
with
virginia’s
4,500
body
deviants
from
ideal,
most
deviant
districts
in
the
lower
house
compared
to
connecticut’s
800.
the
board
did
aim
for
zero
on
that
same
trial
testimony
at
page
262
in
our
appendix,
did
not
aim
for
a
fixed
percentage,
and
we
will
submit
that
even
a
bull’s
eye
in
context
of
this
volatile
field
of
reapportionment,
even
a
bull’s
eye
has
a
certain
breadth
to
it.
we
feel
that
the
--
an
example
of
an
unfortunate
outcome
of
not
having
a
presumptive
constitutionality
rule,
key
to
minuscule
deviation
levels
of
opening
up
everlasting
one
body
better
approach
as
the
iowa
case
nolan
against
turner
which
we
cite
and
discuss
in
our
brief.
regarding
the
question
of
shape
which
really
is
another
aspect
of
compactness,
compactness
and
that
required
by
the
connecticut
state
constitution.
really,
it
is
only
a
possible
alternative
rational
state
policy,
which
a
state
might
want
to
have,
does
not
present
a
federal
issue.
in
connecticut’s
case
as
a
possible
alternative
rational
state
policy,
it
was
subordinated
somewhat
to
the
actual
rational
state
policies
adopted
by
the
apportionment
board,
and
they
were
an
assiduous
stress
on
population
equality,
plus
the
complementary
concerns
for
minimizing
town
line
cuts
and
only
about
1/4
of
towns
where
cut
and
avoidance
of
political
unfairness.
indeed,
in
regard
to
the
shape
compactness
question,
we
can
put
it
this
way.
we
cannot
judge
a
quality
of
a
girl
merely
by
whether
or
not
she
has
a
pleasingly
symmetrical
quality
and
likewise
in
the
volatile
field
of
politics
and
reapportionment,
shape
was
put
in
the
context
of
the
overall
goal
of
reynolds
against
sims,
stated
there
and
repeated
in
the
voting
rights
cases
of
that
effective
representation
is
a
crucial
element
of
the
right
to
vote.
all
we
ask
is
that
a
state
be
allowed
to
implement
this
rational
and
constitutional
goal
through
a
bi-partisan
commission
with
tiebreaker
device
and
by
further
dealing
in,
check
against
the
evil
difficult
to
police
of
invidious
gerrymandering,
under
the
standards
of
whitcomb
against
chavis.
we
also
submit
the
connecticut
plan
is
the
titus
plan
in
population
terms
known
to
us,
given
full
review
in
this
court.
it's
not
been
shown
it'd
be
unfair
in
operation.
it
serves
more
than
one
rational
state
purpose
and
until
it's
shown
to
be
unfair
in
operation
by
proof
meeting
whitcomb
against
chavis
test,
then
we
submit
there
really
is
no
constitutional
basis
for
effective
attack
on
it.
if
there
are
no
questions,
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
robert
g.
dixon,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
direct
appeal
from
a
three-judge
district
court
in
connecticut
which
invalidated
the
official
state
legislative
enforcement
plan.
we
appear
here
in
defense
of
that
official
state
plan.
the
plan
was
devised
by
a
bipartisan
board
of
three
members
including
a
tie-breaker
under
the
state
constitution
which
constitution
thereby
tries
to
incorporate
an
anti-gerrymandering
spirit
in
the
very
reprocess
of
the
apportionment
activity.
the
plan
of
the
board
was
subjected
to
litigation
promptly
in
both
state
and
federal
court.
the
federal
court
denied
a
plea
of
extension
and
on
april
4,
1972,
he
did
invalidate
that
plan.
an
appeal
was
promptly
taken
and
also
a
submission
of
a
motion
for
a
stay
order,
the
motion
was
referred
by
mr.
justice
marshall
to
the
court
and
on
june
12,
1972,
this
court
stayed
the
adverse
district
court
judgment.
that
had
two
effects.
one
was
to
bar
implementation
of
a
master’s
plan
which
had
been
under
preparation,
under
now
stayed
judgment
and
more
importantly
perhaps
and
also
on
the
way
for
conducting
the
1972
election
of
state
legislators
in
connecticut
under
the
official
state
plan,
that
was
done.
along
the
way,
there
was
a
supplementary
mandamus
action
in
state
court
to
clarify
one
or
two
clerical
errors.
the
claim
was
reviewed
by
the
state
court
and
the
state
supreme
court
found
that
no
constitutional
impediment
under
the
state
constitution
to
use
of
the
state
plan.
the
large
question
therefore
here
is
whether
connecticut
can
continue
the
use
of
this
official
state
reinforcement
plan,
gerrymander
of
the
1970
decade.
in
a
more
precise
fashion,
the
federal
issues
are
three,
population
equality,
justification
of
deviations
as
such
be
needed
and
the
plaintiff-appellees’
allegations
of
gerrymandering.
turning
first
to
the
population
issue,
we
assert,
and
most
strongly
assert
that
trivial
deviations
of
the
sort
in
connecticut
and
i’ll
mention
those
in
a
second,
trivial
deviations
present
no
prima
facie
case.
therefore,
the
plan
would
remain
presumptively
constitutional
unless
plaintiff-appellees
could
introduce
proof
of
a
non-population
nature
of
discrimination.
we
think
that
a
concept
of
a
presumptive
constitutionality
concept
keyed
to
a
lack
of
a
prima
facie
case,
if
there
are
trivial
deviations
is
implicit
in
swann
against
adams,
and
was
not
settled
in
swann
against
adams
and
is
implicit
in
the
dissented
opinions
in
kirkpatrick
against
preisler.
what
are
these
connecticut
deviations
which
we
find
so
trivial?
in
percentage
terms,
the
most
deviant
district
from
ideal
in
the
connecticut
senate
deviates
by
only
0.9%.
for
the
lower
house,
most
deviant
district
from
ideal
deviates
by
only
3.9%.
over
these
percentage
terms,
must
be
put
in
a
context
of
the
size
of
the
district
being
created
to
become
meaningful
and
likewise
the
available
census
data
we
look
to
the
census
data.
we
find
that
the
most
deviant
district
in
either
house
in
connecticut
deviates
from
ideal
by
fewer
than
800
census-persons,
for
the
lower
house,
789,
for
the
senate
787.
you
might
well
ask
if
the
population
deviation
in
real
census
terms
is
identical
virtually
why
a
percentage
--
or
the
percentages
is
so
different,
the
answer
is
in
the
size
of
the
districts.
connecticut
has
36
state
senate
seats,
average
population,
84,000
roughly,
800
population
deviants,
census
body
is
deviant
on
that
base
because
there’s
only
0.9%
deviation.
connecticut
has
151
assembly
districts,
average
population
about
20,000
on
that
base
the
same
trivial
800
person
deviation,
gives
you
only
a
--
since
they
raise
the
percent
deviation
to
a
3.9%.
in
terms
of
the
census
data
which
was
the
building
unit
for
the
apportionment
board
of
the
2,700
census
units
available
to
the
board,
88%
in
exceed
400
in
census
population
and
yet
the
average
deviation
in
connecticut
in
either
house
is
under
400.
by
contrast,
howell
against
mahan
--
mahan
against
howell
last
week,
excuse
me,
the
most
deviant
district
from
ideal
was
i
believe
was
about
4,400.
the
figures
of
the
connecticut
type,
we
suggest
are
really
on
target
in
the
reynolds
against
sims
sense
of
substantial
equality
or
of
not
--
or
in
showing
that
the
vote
of
each
voter
in
a
state,
be
approximate
or
equal
to
that
of
any
other
on
target
and
therefore
constitute
no
dilution
of
voting
power.
hence
we
suggest
that
this
case
could
fit
the
general
principle
of
treating
trivial
deviations
of
this
sort
as
constituting
no
prima
facie
case
of
dilution
of
voting
power
as
being
presumptively
constitutional.
more
precisely
and
we’ve
suggest
this
for
connecticut
and
not
for
the
nation
necessarily
about
a
rule
if
we
divide
as
follows
for
connecticut
making
more
precise
this
presumptive
constitutionality
concept.
it
could
run
this
way
that
where
the
maximum
deviation
in
census
population
terms,
actual
census
bodies
in
a
district,
in
most
deviant
district,
in
a
state
plan
is
less
than
the
average
population
of
the
census
units
being
constructed,
that
plan
should
be
presumptively
constitutional.
and
the
average
population
of
the
census
units
in
connecticut
is
1,100,
the
median
unit,
census
unit
is
1,000.
and
as
i
said
the
most
deviant
actual
district
from
ideal
is
only
800.
without
such
a
presumptive
constitutionality
rule
keyed
to
lack
of
showing
a
prima
facie
case
with
trivial
deviations
of
this
sort,
we
feel
the
courts
remain
not
only
in
the
business
of
stirring
up
the
political
thicket,
that
plaintiff
instigation
that
may
take
up
residence
in
a
permanent
basis
in
the
political
thicket.
why
do
we
say
this?
because
plaintiffs
can
always
show
a
slightly
less
deviant
plan
then
laboriously
constructed
official
state
plan
at
any
given
level
of
the
percentage
deviation.
with
a
hand
calculator,
you
could
device
hundreds
of
plans,
each
one
though
having
a
quite
different
political
effect
because
no
district
line
is
neutral.
lower
courts
have
tended
to
follow
this
approach
in
the
past.
in
fact
we’re
having
a
past
and
we’re
still
today
to
an
extent
a
one
body
better
rule.
that
is
plaintiff’s
comment
with
the
plan
often
to
the
last
minute
at
trial
perhaps
showing
their
own
self
serving
plan,
just
no
statewide
input
in
it,
showing
it
is
one
body
better
so
to
speak
than
the
state
plan
and
if
it
--
that
the
election
is
immanent
and
the
state
cannot
justify
or
hasn’t
built
under
the
--
its
process,
the
state
plan
goes
down
the
drain.
now,
mahan
against
howell
last
week,
that
does
not
solve
this
problem
of
avoiding
casual
invalidations
on
a
one
body
better
rule
because
the
state
which
has
tried
to
be
directly
on
target
and
does
not
crank
into
its
process
any
corollary
rational
state
purposes
than
an
attempt
to
be
directly
on
target
in
population
could
not
qualify
to
utilize
the
mahan
against
howell
justifications
process.
however
with
--
what
we
do
--
i
refer
to
here
is
a
presumptive
constitutionality
rule,
keyed
a
very
low
deviations
of
this
sort,
we
will
achieve
some
legislative
certainty,
the
bodies
can
apportion
without
the
sense
of
futility
as
often
been
the
case
in
the
last
several
years,
litigation
have
been
massive
as
we
all
know
even
after
1970
census.
as
far
as
courts
are
concerned
of
this
approach
a
finding
that
there
is
no
prima
facie
case
with
low
deviations
of
this
sort,
trivial
deviations
would
flush
out
many
petty
cases.
reserved
court
time
for
those
cases
for
justification
does
seem
needed
because
the
size
of
the
deviation
or
for
the
more
complex
issue
of
gerrymandering
if
the
court
proceeds
in
that
direction.
mr.
robert
g.
dixon,
jr.
no.
excuse
me,
i
said
--
mr.
robert
g.
dixon,
jr.
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
robert
g.
dixon,
jr.
i
apologize.
mr.
robert
g.
dixon,
jr.
mr.
justice
stewart,
my
point
was
for
--
was
made
in
general
terms
that
a
state
might
have
only
a
straight
population
purpose,
that
is
not
connecticut.
connecticut
has
three
purposes
to
be
served
in
its
reapportionment
process.
and
we’re
suggesting
that
we
would
not
reach
the
need
to
justify,
shouldn’t
have
reached
the
need
to
justify
until
it
is
first
determined
that
the
deviations
of
a
given
plan
and
i’m
not
talking
about
connecticut
with
its
trivial
deviations,
are
high
enough
to
warrant
constitutional
concern.
mr.
robert
g.
dixon,
jr.
we
fell
that
if
the
deviations
are
smaller,
not
when
deviations
are
smaller
than
the
census
average
population
--
the
average
population
census
unit
is
being
used
that
it
is
really
on
target
and
should
be
declared
constitutional.
mr.
robert
g.
dixon,
jr.
without
getting
to
it,
the
process
justification
is
correct
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
robert
g.
dixon,
jr.
that
would
depend
upon
mr.
justice
stewart,
depend
upon
the
rational
state
policy
at
issue
and
i
think
that
is
an
next
logical
consideration
for
the
connecticut
case.
we
have
sought
not
merely
to
achieve
population
equality
directly
on
target
as
a
pre-eminent
goal
in
order
to
serve
the
overall
purpose
of
fair
and
defect
in
representation.
i
mentioned
several
times
reynolds
against
sims.
we
have
also
added
two
corollary
policies
which
we
think
would
support
this
plan
under
the
decision
of
mahan
against
howell
last
week.
in
short,
if
we
do
not
prevail
on
a
theory
of
presumptive
constitutionality
because
deviations
are
very
trivial,
then
there
are
the
following
justifications
to
be
made.
the
apportionment
board
seeking
close
population
equality
also
had
two
corollary
policies,
a
connecticut
town
policy
and
a
policy
of
political
balance
or
fairness
which
i’ll
define
in
just
a
moment.
now
turning
first
to
the
town
policy
which
is
the
analogue
of
the
no-county
line
policy
in
mahan
against
howell
last
week,
we
find
that
where
virginia
could
honor
that
fully
and
still
stay
inside
a
top
to
bottom
variation
of
16%.
the
connecticut
sought
to
honor
its
town
--
its
no-town
line
cut
fully
for
the
lower
house,
it
does
not
apply
to
the
senate
but
for
the
lower
house.
the
population
deviations
would
reach
a
111%
if
we
bring
forth
the
1965
plan,
and
cut
no-town
lines
and
test
it
out
under
the
1970
census.
110%,
11%
is
way
beyond
howell
against
mahan
even
if
we
think
a
no-cut
policy
is
good.
we
do
think
that
--
an
important
to
note,
the
purposes
lying
behind
is
no
local
division
line
cuts
in
order
to
see
if
they
can
be
served
by
some
other
premises.
mahan
against
howell
last
week,
speaking
of
the
virginia
county
policy,
analogous
to
the
no-cut
policy
in
connecticut,
said
that
it
served
the
purpose
of
furthering
a
political
voice
for
the
counties.
we
see
in
this
a
judicial
recognition
of
community
of
interest
factor
in
representation
that
also
spoke
of
the
no-cut
policy
asserting
an
important
anti-gerrymandering
function.
we
see
in
this
a
judicial
recognition
of
the
danger
of
blind
or
invidious
line
drawing.
the
apportionment
board
in
connecticut
honored
the
town
--
the
no
town
line
cut
policy
substantially.
approximate
3/4
for
the
line
of
the
towns
are
not
cut.
the
board
cut
47
towns
out
of
169.
it
then
--
seeking
to
serve
--
preserve
the
substance
if
not
the
latter
on
all
cut
policy
and
the
purposes
of
political
voice
and
of
anti-gerrymandering
used
a
complementary
policy
of
political
fairness
or
political
balance
which
requires
some
definition.
this
political
balance
or
political
fairness
policy
but
that
is
found.
the
board
with
knowledge
of
public
voting
patterns
in
past
elections
tried
to
divide
equal
population
districts
which
would
and
knowing
out
of
hope
of
avoiding
the
minority
election,
it
actually
occurred
in
1970
in
connecticut
but
would
actually
--
of
our
hope
of
providing
each
party
with
a
seat
gain,
the
legislature
approximately
proportionate
to
its
percent
or
total
of
--
percent
total
of
popular
vote.
now
a
functional
trend
--
you’ll
see
this
is
being
a
vital
arrogant,
anti-gerrymandering
principle
and
an
attempt
to
safeguard
a
political
opportunity
for
effective
political
action
by
all
of
the
voters.
the
essence
of
this
political
fairness
or
political
balance
principle
uses
a
corollary
of
principle
where
they
attempt
to
cut
no
town
lines
and
they
only
cut
3/4,
i
know
it
would
become
--
what
they
felt
with
the
on
target
in
equality
terms.
the
assessment
says,
“a
direct
turning
away
from
a
gerrymandering
purpose,
one
other
result
from
the
plan
that
was
achieved.”
we
think
that
in
regarding
1966
to
1970
election
data,
the
plan
is
conceitedly
fair,
demonstrably
so.
regarding
1972,
we
would
suggest
that
it
is
also
demonstrably
fair,
all
class
before
the
court.district
court,
would’ve
achieved
somewhat
the
same
outcome
in
1972
under
all
plans,
it
would’ve
been
an
excess
seat
gained
for
republican
party.
why?
because
that
was
a
landslide
election
here
in
connecticut
and
past
election
data
in
connecticut
and
indeed
a
civil
law
of
political
science
indicates
that
when
you
have
a
landslide
election,
the
seat
gained
runs
substantially
ahead
of
the
percent
of
the
--
of
vote
cast.
and
also,
the
charts
on
this
point
in
our
reply
brief
indicate
that
the
factor
of
(inaudible)
seats
is
endemic
and
all
the
plans
before
the
district
court
and
the
--
is
no
different
under
the
official
state
plan
than
other
plans.
mr.
robert
g.
dixon,
jr.
mr.
justice
white,
we
find
the
--
we
would
find
in
that
instance
that
we
have
--
presented
to
us
that
issue
of
gerrymandering
whether
or
not
with
the
equality
satisfied,
there
were
nevertheless
because
of
district
pattern
as
mentioned
in
fortson
against
dorsey,
a
substantial
submergence
of
a
political
arrangement
within
the
population
which
had
bring
--
which
would
then
--
mr.
robert
g.
dixon,
jr.
no.
mr.
justice
white,
our
proposition
would
be
this
that
what
is
--
if
a
state
does
not
violate
any
constitutional
requirement
of
the
federal
constitution
by
seeking
a
policy
of
fairness
along
with
a
policy
of
population
equality.
mr.
robert
g.
dixon,
jr.
and
by
political
fairness
in
this
sense
we
do
mean
something
called
political
balance
does
require
consulting
past
election
data
and
testing
out
various
plans
possible
to
see
if
they
would
become
--
would
appear
very
unfair
under
no
bordering
pattern
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
robert
g.
dixon,
jr.
we
could
use
that
term
not
required
by
this
court
--
mr.
robert
g.
dixon,
jr.
yes
mr.
justice
stewart,
that
is
precisely
our
position
here
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
robert
g.
dixon,
jr.
our
position
on
that
is
that
that
is
a
mater
for
plaintiff
proof,
for
plaintiff
attack
on
a
state
plan
and
that
because
gerrymandering
of
an
invidious
sort
is
not
clearly
subject
to
close
policing
by
this
court
yet
an
attempt
to
be
fair
should
not
be
questionable
either.
my
last
point
as
to
mention
the
plaintiff-appellee's
gerrymandering
argument,
they
do
allege
that
the
plan
is
a
gerrymander
of
an
invidious
sense
that
we
see
in
this
record
not
one
iota
of
proof
regarding
the
standards
suggested
in
whitcomb
against
chavis
following
on
that
from
fortson
against
dorsey
for
attacks
on
plans
on
an
impact
basis
rather
than
a
population
basis.
this
court
said
in
whitcomb
that
when
that
kind
of
claim
is
made
there
must
a
showing
that
the
districts
were
conceded
or
operated
as
purposeful
devices
to
further
discrimination,
racial
economic,
you
can
say
a
fortiori
political
fits
that
that
principle
and
the
proof
on
whitcomb
must
be
real
life
proof
of
impact
on
--
in
view
of
voting
power.
so
in
short
we
suggest
that
at
one
level
we
have
a
plan
with
deviation,
somewhat
trivial
that
should
be
deemed
to
be
presumptively
constitutional,
absent
a
gerrymandering
type
proof.
that
is
not
thought
to
be
the
case,
not
figured
enough
and
we’ll
suggest
too
rational
state
policy
to
justify
the
deviations
preserving
as
many
town
lines
as
possible
or
about
3/4
and
also
making
a
good
faith
attempt
to
avoid
unfairness.
and
last
we
find
no
evidence
at
all
here
of
any
overt
invidious
gerrymandering
of
the
sort
which
this
court
has
spoken
of
in
whitcomb
against
chavis
in
similar
cases.
may
it
please
the
court,
i
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
robert
g.
dixon,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
opposing
counsel
stated
yesterday
that
he
had
no
quarrel
with
the
state
plan
regarding
the
senate.
he
attacks
primarily
that
part
of
the
state
plan
regarding
the
house
and
yet,
the
census
body
deviation
for
the
senate
is
identical
with
that
in
the
house.
in
each
case,
match
from
deviation
from
ideal
of
under
800
average
deviation,
under
400,
and
the
median
census
unit
is
1000
in
population.
also
the
same
apportionment
board
process
was
used
including
the
political
fairness
of
principle
for
the
senate
as
in
the
house.
it's
concession
therefore
it
seem
to
remove
all
federal
issues
from
the
house
aspect
of
the
case
too,
with
the
possible
exemption
of
invidious
gerrymandering
within
burden
of
proof
standards
of
whitcomb
against
chavis.
opposing
counsel,
remarked
yesterday
also,
there
were
precedent
cases.
as
we
see
it,
he
failed
to
distinguish
between
the
state
reapportionment
line
of
cases
flowing
from
reynolds,
swann,
to
mahan
and
a
lot
of
gaffney,
from
the
congressional
districting
line
of
cases.
he
seems
to
us
to
be
arguing
for
an
overruling
of
mahan.
we
welcome
mahan
and
simply
seek
to
add
to
it.
now,
yesterday’s
arguments
in
certain
other
cases
in
texas
urged
this
court
to
mandate
political
fairness
or
as
better
phrase
as
equal
political
opportunity
principle
to
mandate
that
under
the
fourteenth
amendment.
that
would
be
a
large
order.
it
might
be
good
depending
upon
the
facts
of
given
case,
but
that
is
not
our
case.
we
do
not
ask
this
court
to
mandate
political
fairness
under
the
fourteenth
amendment.
however,
i
want
to
state
as
in
connecticut
pursues
a
policy,
a
political
fairness
in
a
conscious
anti-gerrymandering
spirit
trying
to
spot
pitfalls
and
avoid
those
pitfalls
in
a
very
process
of
devising
districts
which
might
characterized
as
benevolent,
gerrymandering,
stressing
the
word
benevolent,
purpose
being
to
effectuate
certain
representation
interests,
political,
racial
or
otherwise,
there
is
no
federal
constitutional
impediment.
i
am
returning
now
to
the
aspect
of
the
case
concerning
our
suggestion
of
a
need
for
a
presumptive
constitutionality
rule
key
to
trivial
deviations.
i
suggest
that
as
next
logical
step
after
mahan
against
howell,
acts
as
such
a
rule
could
penalize
a
state
which
has
sought
a
level
of
population
equality
well
within
mahan
against
howell.
but
perhaps,
perhaps
thereby
as
weakened
the
plan’s
connection
with
other
rational
state
policies
which
could
operate
if
needed
at
the
justification
level.
that
circumstance
absent
a
presumptive
constitutionality
rule
key
to
trivial
deviations,
plaintiff
could
more
easily,
quite
easily
perhaps
defeat
the
official
plan
by
simply
offering
his
own
one
body
better
plan
either
at
trial
week
before
--
two
weeks
before
and
upset
a
broadly
constructed
state
plan
of
many
inputs
in
it
of
statewide
nature.
also,
it
would
seem
to
us
that
in
the
context
of
the
kennedy
case,
the
plaintiff’s
plan
should
have
been
before
the
reapportionment
board,
and
not
presented
just
before
trial.
certainly,
on
this
branch
of
the
case,
the
presumptive
constitutionality
rule,
a
state’s
burden
should
not
become
heavier,
with
very
trivial
population
deviations,
then,
the
burden
imposed
on
virginia
in
mahan
against
howell.
with
virginia’s
4,500
body
deviants
from
ideal,
most
deviant
districts
in
the
lower
house
compared
to
connecticut’s
800.
the
board
did
aim
for
zero
on
that
same
trial
testimony
at
page
262
in
our
appendix,
did
not
aim
for
a
fixed
percentage,
and
we
will
submit
that
even
a
bull’s
eye
in
context
of
this
volatile
field
of
reapportionment,
even
a
bull’s
eye
has
a
certain
breadth
to
it.
we
feel
that
the
--
an
example
of
an
unfortunate
outcome
of
not
having
a
presumptive
constitutionality
rule,
key
to
minuscule
deviation
levels
of
opening
up
everlasting
one
body
better
approach
as
the
iowa
case
nolan
against
turner
which
we
cite
and
discuss
in
our
brief.
regarding
the
question
of
shape
which
really
is
another
aspect
of
compactness,
compactness
and
that
required
by
the
connecticut
state
constitution.
really,
it
is
only
a
possible
alternative
rational
state
policy,
which
a
state
might
want
to
have,
does
not
present
a
federal
issue.
in
connecticut’s
case
as
a
possible
alternative
rational
state
policy,
it
was
subordinated
somewhat
to
the
actual
rational
state
policies
adopted
by
the
apportionment
board,
and
they
were
an
assiduous
stress
on
population
equality,
plus
the
complementary
concerns
for
minimizing
town
line
cuts
and
only
about
1/4
of
towns
where
cut
and
avoidance
of
political
unfairness.
indeed,
in
regard
to
the
shape
compactness
question,
we
can
put
it
this
way.
we
cannot
judge
a
quality
of
a
girl
merely
by
whether
or
not
she
has
a
pleasingly
symmetrical
quality
and
likewise
in
the
volatile
field
of
politics
and
reapportionment,
shape
was
put
in
the
context
of
the
overall
goal
of
reynolds
against
sims,
stated
there
and
repeated
in
the
voting
rights
cases
of
that
effective
representation
is
a
crucial
element
of
the
right
to
vote.
all
we
ask
is
that
a
state
be
allowed
to
implement
this
rational
and
constitutional
goal
through
a
bi-partisan
commission
with
tiebreaker
device
and
by
further
dealing
in,
check
against
the
evil
difficult
to
police
of
invidious
gerrymandering,
under
the
standards
of
whitcomb
against
chavis.
we
also
submit
the
connecticut
plan
is
the
titus
plan
in
population
terms
known
to
us,
given
full
review
in
this
court.
it's
not
been
shown
it'd
be
unfair
in
operation.
it
serves
more
than
one
rational
state
purpose
and
until
it's
shown
to
be
unfair
in
operation
by
proof
meeting
whitcomb
against
chavis
test,
then
we
submit
there
really
is
no
constitutional
basis
for
effective
attack
on
it.
if
there
are
no
questions,
thank
you
very
much.
