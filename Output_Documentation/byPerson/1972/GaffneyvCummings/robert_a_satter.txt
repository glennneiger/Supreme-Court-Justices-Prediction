mr.
robert
a.
satter
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
court
scored
a
stunning
six
sets
in
the
one
man
one
vote
doctrine
in
the
cases
which
enunciated
that
doctrine.
in
the
space
of
a
few
years,
this
court
has
come
close
to
achieving
or
leading
this
country
to
achieve
the
fundamental
purpose
of
that
doctrine
and
has
thereby
enhanced
a
fundamental
civil
right,
namely
the
right
of
each
individual
citizen
to
an
equally
weighted
vote.
and
as
this
court
said
in
reynolds
to
the
extent
that
a
citizen
--
the
citizens’
right
to
vote
is
debased,
he
is
that
much
less
a
citizen.
and
so
these
one
man
one
vote
cases
are
important
and
they
put
us
on
a
high
road
toward
improving
the
quality
of
our
democracy
and
the
passion
and
the
high
hopes
with
which
this
court
started
that
journey
with
baker
against
karr
should
not
play
and
particularly
it
should
not
play
in
light
of
how
close
we
are
to
an
ultimate
success.
mr.
robert
a.
satter
i
think
they
have
that
same
principle,
yes.
whether
people
do
or
do
not
vote
doesn’t
change
the
quality
of
the
--
change
the
necessity
of
having
equally
weighted
votes
or
giving
people
the
opportunity
to
be
in
districts
where
they
have
an
equal
voice
with
every
other
person.
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
a.
satter
of
course
you
don’t.
i
might
say
in
connecticut
that
the
history
is
that
we
vote
close
to
80%
in
many
of
our
elections
and
in
fact
some
of
our
presidential
elections,
we
have
voted
close
to
90%
and
that’s
a
remarkable
fact
but
it’s
true.
now
why
do
i
say
that
we
have
come
so
close
to
success
in
these
one
man
one
vote
doc
--
in
these
one
man
one
vote
cases.
because
the
facts
are,
that
in
53%
of
the
states,
the
extent
of
a
deviation
is
5%
or
less.
the
range
of
deviation
is
5%
or
less
in
their
--
in
the
reapportionment
of
their
senate
and
47
--
and
in
47%
of
the
states,
the
range
of
deviation
is
5%
or
less
in
the
house,
in
their
lower
house
and
by
range
of
deviation
i
mean
plus
or
minus
to
and
a
half
percent.
now
the
states
did
not
come
to
that
voluntarily.
the
states
were
not
anxious
to
accord
this
extent
of
equality
to
their
citizens’
tree
on
their
own
free
will.
reapportionment
is
a
very
painful
process.
i
know
it
because
i
have
been
in
the
state
legislature
and
i
have
been
in
the
state
legislature
in
which
i
was
required
to
reapportion
myself
and
it
is
a
very
painful
process.
it
is
a
painful
process
whether
the
legislators
are
doing
it
or
whether
others
are
doing
it.
and
the
concern
for
the
equality
of
the
vote,
of
the
individual
citizen
on
the
part
of
the
reapportioners
if
left
to
their
own
devices
is
very
slight,
except
when
this
court
has
required
them
to
do
so.
mr.
robert
a.
satter
we
submitted
a
plan
of
deviation
of
2.16%.
mr.
robert
a.
satter
7.8%,
the
range
of
deviation
is
7.8%
your
honor.
mr.
robert
a.
satter
no,
the
range
from
the
highest
to
the
lowest.
mr.
robert
a.
satter
that
means
that
it
was
plus
3.9
and
approximately
minus
3.9
your
honor.
mr.
robert
a.
satter
oh,
no.
we
don’t
disagree
with
the
figures
at
all.
mr.
robert
a.
satter
no
your
honor.
we
recognize
that
the
range
of
deviation
is
7.8%.
mr.
robert
a.
satter
yes.
mr.
robert
a.
satter
that
was
to
the
house,
yes.
we
make
no
issue
whatever
in
this
respect.
mr.
robert
a.
satter
it’s
not
here.
we
obviously
recognize
--
mr.
robert
a.
satter
i
think
the
figures
that
are
in
the
--
in
a
stipulation
are
correct,
yes
and
that’s
that
i
think
the
court
found.
mr.
robert
a.
satter
not
have
that
argument.
and
so,
may
it
please
the
court,
the
point
i
am
making
is
that
the
process
is
a
painful
one
that
the
rights
of
the
individual
citizen
are
only
going
to
be
protected
by
a
court
having
a
very
firm
and
severe
stand
on
the
requirement
to
achieve
equality.
and
that
thus
the
states
have
to
be
ordered
first,
to
reapportion
and
baker
against
karr
made
that
issue
sufficiently
litigable
for
them
to
realize
they
had
to
and
secondly
that
they
had
to
achieve
equality.
the
reynolds
case
established
the
standard
of
equality
as
equal,
as
practicable.
there
is
no
question
that
it
had
some
caveats
in
it.
it’s
expressly
stated
that
absolute
maximum
exactness
or
precision
was
not
required.
and
taking
the
very
tolerant
approach
that
appeared
to
be
implicit
in
the
reynolds
decision,
the
courts
replied
and
in
the
period
after
1964,
the
pattern
of
approved
deviation
in
state
legislative
cases
ranged
substantially
above
15%.
and
in
fact,
our
record
shows
that
prior
to
1969,
88%
of
our
states
had
deviations
of
over
15%
with
respect
to
their
senate
and
96%
had
deviations
with
respect
to
their
house
of
over
15%.
and
then
came
kirkpatrick,
fortuitously
in
1969,
prior
to
the
1970
census
and
prior
to
the
time
when
the
vast
majority
of
the
states
had
to
reapportion
and
the
kirkpatrick
decision
had
two
parts
to
it.
the
first
part
was
that
the
standard
of
equality
was
going
to
be
strict
as
equal
as
practicable
manner
that
the
states
had
to
seek
to
achieve
precise
mathematical
equality
and
they
were
to
be
permitted
only
those
deviations
in
which
the
variations
were
unavoidable.
and
the
second
aspect
of
it
was
that
virtually
all
excuses
or
justifications
at
least
as
applied
to
congressional
reapportionment,
were
going
to
be
ruled
out.
and
the
states
listened
to
that
and
they
knew
that
this
court
meant
what
it
was
saying
and
they
felt
that
they
had
to
apply
those
rules
in
the
kirkpatrick
case
to
their
own
state
legislative
reapportionment.
they
were
very
attuned
as
all
reapportioning
authorities
are
to
the
nuisances
of
the
language
of
this
court’s
opinion
where
they
can
find
a
escape
hole,
where
they
can
interpret
an
out,
they
will
do
so
because
achieving
equality
is
not
a
high
priority
on
the
part
of
reapportioners.
they
have
other
purposes.
they
do
not
have
purpose
unless
a
court
tells
them
that
they
have
to
have
it,
but
they
read
kirkpatrick
to
say
it
applies
to
us
and
we’re
going
to
listen
to
it
and
we’re
going
to
apply
it
and
that’s
why
we
have
53%
of
the
states
keeping
within
a
deviation
of
5%
or
less.
mr.
robert
a.
satter
how
many
states?
your
honor
its
53%
is
all
but
it
--
what?
mr.
robert
a.
satter
right.
thank
you
your
honor.
and
what
this
has
demonstrated
is
and
i
know
this
line
has
been
said
to
you
so
many
times
it’s
a
frightful
cliché
that
the
life
of
the
law
is
not
logic
but
experience
and
experience
has
proven
the
wisdom
of
justice
brennan’s
statement
in
kirkpatrick
that
a
state
legislature
which
tries
can
achieve
complete
numerical
equality
among
all
of
the
states
districts.
and
this
is
the
answer
to
the
--
this
court's
carping
critics
who
have
run
their
hands
over
an
over
insistence
upon
equality
among
the
districts.
that
is
an
over
insistence
upon
achieving
an
equally
weighted
vote
for
our
citizens
as
if
we
can
ever
have
an
over
insistence
upon
perpetuating
valid
and
important
constitutional
rights
and
that
was
the
purpose
--
mr.
robert
a.
satter
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
a.
satter
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
issues
in
a
reapportionment
case
can
be
framed
as
follows:
one,
the
standard
of
equality
that’s
going
to
be
applied;
two,
the
nature
or
the
type
of
a
rational
state
policy
which
would
justify
deviations
in
excess
of
that
standard;
and
three,
the
tolerable
limits
of
the
deviations,
even
if
they
are
justified.
expressing
or
framing
the
issues
in
that
fashion
sets
a
blueprint
for
the
kinds
of
evidence
necessary
to
prove
a
case
of
this
nature
and
establishes
the
legal
questions
necessary
to
decide
it
and
let
me
endeavor
to
apply
these
principles
to
our
case
before
us.
as
to
the
standard
of
equality,
we
urge
that,
that
continue
to
be
a
strict
as
it
has
been
and
that
the
cause,
that
the
greatest
cause
of
the
success
of
reapportionment
in
the
1970’s
which
i
eluded
to
yesterday
that
50%
of
the
states
have
achieved
a
deviation
of
5%
or
less
is
because
of
the
strictness
of
that
standard.
now,
the
equal
as
practicalable
expression
in
reynolds
is
kind
of
a
wavering
line
and
does
not
state
the
standard
with
sufficient
precision.
i
urge
upon
this
court
to
continue
the
standard
expressed
in
the
kirkpatrick
case,
namely
that
the
states
be
required
to
achieve
as
price
--
as
precise
the
mathematically
quality
as
they
can
and
only
limited
population
variances
which
are
unavoidable
will
be
permitted
unless
they
can
be
justified.
now,
those
words
and
that
standard
are
uncomfortable
to
the
reapportionment.
i
know
because
i
have
been
in
the
back
rooms
with
the
reapportionments.
but
it
is
necessary
that
it'd
be
uncomfortable
for
them
because
the
only
thing
that
assures
a
respect
for
the
constitutional
right
of
the
individual
citizen
to
an
equally
weighted
vote,
the
only
thing
that
assures
a
respect
for
the
constitutional
right
of
the
individual
citizen
to
an
equally
weighted
vote
is
the
language
of
the
opinions
of
this
court.
and
i
urge
that
you
do
not
adopt
the
de
minimis
rule
that
has
been
asked
of
you
by
the
appellants.
certainly,
it
should
not
be
applied
in
this
case
where
the
deviations
are
7.8%,
which
is
in
excess
of
what
50%
of
the
states
have
already
achieved.
and
in
the
cases
which
have
required
that
close
a
deviation,
less
than
5%,
they
over
and
over
again
say
in
their
opinions,
the
lower
court
say
there
is
no
de
minimis
rule.
and
as
it
was
pointed
out
in
kirkpatrick,
once
you
establish
a
de
minimis
rule
that
becomes
the
target
at
which
the
reapportioners
will
aim
at,
and
not
at
precise
equality.
moreover,
we
urge
you
not
to
adopt
any
presumption
of
constitutionality
in
this
case
as
the
appellants
have
urged
upon
you.
essentially,
the
argument
is
the
same.
the
great
expansion
of
civil
rights
in
this
country,
and
now
by
civil
rights,
i
mean
the
rights
that
have
derived
from
the
equal
protections
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment,
the
rights
that
have
come
from
the
first
amendment,
freedom
of
speech
and
freedom
of
religion,
and
the
rights
that
come
from
the
other
amendments
to
the
constitution,
in
my
judgment,
derived
their
fundamental
source
from
three
basis
causes.
first;
the
standing
of
citizens
to
sue,
that
was
terribly
important.
giving
a
standing
to
citizens
to
sue
for
these
important
rights
and
as
kind
of
a
subdivision
of
that,
a
kind
of
expansion
of
the
whole
notion
under
the
federal
rules
of
class
actions.
secondly;
the
availability
of
lawyers
and
the
willingness
of
lawyers
to
take
these
cases;
and
thirdly,
not
necessarily
an
absence
of
the
presumption
of
constitutionality
in
these
basic
civil
rights
cases,
but
at
least
a
kind
of
dip
in
the
presumption
of
constitutionality.
in
order
to
lower
the
threshold
of
the
burden
of
proof
upon
the
plaintiffs
for
them
to
establish
a
prima
facie
case,
and
then
require
the
states
to
come
forward
in
these
basic
civil
rights
cases
and
explain
or
to
justify
why
they
have
created
an
unequal
treatment.
and
i
would
trust
that
that
basic
kind
of
underlying
rule
that
you
have
adopted
in
these
basic
civil
rights
cases
would
not
be
changed
in
this
kind
of
a
case
or
in
any
of
the
civil
rights
cases.
now,
let’s
apply
the
standard
of
equality
to
the
case
before
us.
the
deviation
in
this
case,
the
range
of
deviation
which
i
previously
defined
from
top
to
bottom
was
7.8%.
a
plan
was
submitted
by
the
plaintiffs
showing
that
the
deviation
in
this
case
could
have
been
2.6%,
the
range
of
deviation
could
have
been
2.6%.
that
plan
was
based
on
the
same
census
material
as
was
available
to
the
board.
it
was
prepared
by
an
unquestioned
expert.
the
expert
and
the
plan
itself
was
known
to
the
appellants,
was
given
to
them
at
least
two
weeks
before
the
trial
in
accordance
within
a
pretrial
order,
a
pretrial
conference
order
of
the
trial
judge.
the
plaintiff
said
--
excuse
me,
the
appellants
said
the
opportunity
to
depose
the
plaintiff’s
expert
before
trial.
they
had
the
opportunity
to
cross-examine
him
at
trial
as
to
whether
or
not
the
plan
that
was
submitted
indicated
that
there
was
an
opportunity
to
avoid
the
deviation
in
the
board
plan.
and
finally,
there
was
a
finding
by
the
court
or
at
least
an
implied
finding
by
the
court
that
it
had
accept
it
as
a
reliable
demonstration
of
how
greater
equality
could’ve
been
achieved
with
the
materials
on
hand,
and
the
court
so
expressly
stated
that.
and
this
is
the
way
these
cases
have
been
tried.
they
where
tried
in
swann
that
way.
a
party
puts
in
a
plan
that
shows
that
greater
deviations
are
possible,
and
the
deviations
in
the
plan
are
avoidable,
and
that’s
a
perfectly
litigable
issue.
it
is
subjected
to
objective
proof,
namely
the
use
of
the
census
data,
the
pretrial
conference
can
require
that
any
plans
which
are
going
to
be
submitted
by
any
party
shall
be
provided
to
the
other
parties
for
examination.
their
witnesses
shall
be
determined
and
you
have
a
litigable
issue
upon
which
a
court
on
the
basis
of
objective
evidence
can
find
an
answer
and
render
a
finding.
and
in
this
case,
the
court
found
that
the
plan
of
the
plaintiffs
was
a
reliable,
valid,
and
accurate
expression
of
the
possibility
for
reducing
of
--
reducing
the
deviations.
now,
let
me
turn
for
a
moment
to
the
argument
made
by
the
appellants
that
the
average
population
of
census
units
has
some
meaning
and
there
is
some
opportunity
to
as
an
object
of
standard
as
to
what
the
court
should
aim
at.
that
average
population
of
census
units
is
a
figure
with
no
meaning
whatever,
what
is
it?
you
take
the
total
population
of
a
state,
you
take
a
haphazard
number
which
represents
all
the
census
units
in
a
particular
census,
namely
the
block
groups,
the
enumeration
districts,
etcetera.
you
divide
them
together,
you
divide
one
to
the
other,
and
that's
your
average
census
unit;
average
population
of
a
census
unit.
it
means
nothing
statistically.
it
means
nothing
in
the
objective
utility.
it
has
no
operative
utility
in
the
development
of
the
plan
because
the
important
thing
is
what
is
the
size
of
the
lowest
census
units.
districts
--
legislative
districts
are
put
together
by
various
census
units.
you
want
to
know
how
many
there
are
of
a
small
--
of
the
small
population
units
and
compare
that
number
with
the
number
of
districts
which
have
to
be
made.
and
here,
there
were
a
151
districts,
but
there
were
over
--
there
were
240
of
the
census
units
which
where
below
300.
and
in
fact,
the
plan
which
we
developed
showed
that
only
four
of
those
census
units
--
over
--
only
four
of
the
districts
with
the
same
census
material
had
to
be
over
200
people.
now,
the
question
is
having
arrived
at
the
fact
that
the
deviations
are
avoidable,
is
there
any
justification
for
them?
the
district
court
found
that
partisan
political
structuring
was
a
substantial
cause
of
the
numerical
deviation
of
the
board
plan
here.
“if
partisan
political
balancing
were
eliminated
as
a
factor,
a
closer
approach
to
perfect
equality
could
be
achieved.”
now
the
question
is,
is
political
structuring
a
legitimate
state
interest
which
justifies
these
deviations?
and
we
assert
to
your
honors
that
it
is
not.
it
is
not
listed
among
the
permissible
justifications
in
the
reynolds
case.
it
is
expressly
rejected
in
the
kirkpatrick
case
where
this
court
said
practical
politics
cannot
justify
population
disparities.
the
consideration
of
political
party
strength
was
deemed
to
be
in
quotes
“in
apposite”
in
the
ely
v.
klahr
case.
this
so-called
political
balancing
doesn’t
serve
a
governmental
purpose
such
as
a
respect
for
town
lines
where
you
have
towns
who
have
an
interest
in
the
state
legislature.
it
is
not
supported
by
any
state
constitution
or
any
state
statute
and
finally,
it
is
much
too
wide
in
avenue
of
subterfuge,
to
be
allowed
as
a
justification
because
it
will
always
be
brought
out,
because
that
is
always
the
reason
for
any
deviation
that
a
plan
gets,
that
that
the
plan
has.
it
is
not
an
objective
standard
and
if
allowed,
a
political
balancing,
a
political
compromise,
if
all
these
political
business
is
ever
allowed
as
a
justification
for
a
deviation,
it
will
press
this
court
to
the
tolerable
limits
as
to
what
it
will
accept
because
it
will
always
be
paraded
out
before
you.
now,
what
is
it,
well,
what
further
is
the
reason
why
you
should
reject
it
as
a
rational
state
policy?
remember,
in
order
to
achieve
it,
you
in
the
kind
of
political
structure
we're
talking
about,
you
take
the
total
statewide
vote
for
each
political
party
in
all
of
these
individual
district
elections,
and
you
say
that
the
percentage
of
the
total
vote
in
each
of
these
individual
election,
that
total
is
to
be
the
same
percentage
as
the
political
party
candidates
win
for
the
--
win
in
the
legislature.
now,
that
number
of
adding
up,
that
all
of
these
individual
districts,
single
district
elections
is
meaningless
because
these
individual
single
district
elections
are
disparate
and
they
go
off
on
a
many
different
reasons.
on
local
tax
questions,
on
a
question
of
sex
education
in
the
schools,
on
the
question
of,
i
know
of
an
attorney
who
lost
an
election,
representative
candidate
because
he
represented
a
black
person
in
the
purchase
of
a
house
in
a
local
town.
and
add
up
those
numbers
in
these
individual
single
district
elections
and
say
that
that
total
has
any
meaning,
in
my
judgment
is
like
adding
up
apples,
and
ancient
hockey
sticks
and
deflated
basketballs.
it
doesn’t
mean
anything.
but
because
it’s
an
irrational
number,
it
also
creates
your
rational
consequences.
now,
this
marvelous
cartoon
that’s
sitting
before
you,
during
the
course
of
my
argument,
reveals
what
i’m
talking
about.
if
you’re
going
to
take
the
excess
plurality
of
a
particular
political
party
in
a
particular
district,
a
section
of
the
state
and
say
that
that
excess
plurality
can
be
the
basis
for
his
--
for
that
party
electing
candidates
in
another
part
of
the
state,
you
got
to
wiggle
and
jiggle
and
ferret
it
out,
parties,
candidates,
party
votes
all
over
the
state,
and
that
is
what
happens.
that’s
a
district.
this
is
assembly
district
number
13,
this
is
number
14
and
this
is
12
and
this
is
14,
that’s
an
indecent
piece
of
drawing.
this
is
what
could
have
if
you
are
interested
in
seeking
some
form
of
rationality.
that’s
the
same
districts,
but
they’re
irrationally
arranged.
this
is
another
indecent
district
in
windsor
and
bloomfield,
and
that’s
the
way
--
this
is
the
way
that
that
district
could’ve
been
rearranged.
mr.
robert
a.
satter
i
think
that
to
design
a
scheme
of
rea
--
a
proportion
representation?
mr.
robert
a.
satter
yes,
if
you
took
the
whole
state
instead
of
one
district,
i
would
not
object
to
that.
i
mean
i
think
i
cannot
see
it.
mr.
robert
a.
satter
that
is
right.
but
the
problem
is
--
mr.
robert
a.
satter
it
sounds
like
it,
yes.
but
in
fact,
it
results
in
a
distortion
of
the
districts
to
a
frightful
extent.
it
justifies
the
mutalization
of
the
individual
districts.
mr.
robert
a.
satter
it
attempts
to
approach
it,
yes.
mr.
robert
a.
satter
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
a.
satter
oh
yes.
they
are
exactly
the
same.
mr.
robert
a.
satter
oh,
absolutely.
the
same
geographic
area
is
covered
in
the
these,
but
this
is
what
happened
and
the
consequence
of
this
is,
is
that
least
that
you
get
a
questioning
of
the
fitness
of
the
whole
reapportionment
system,
and
somewhat,
a
disrespect
for
the
whole
legitimacy
of
the
plan.
now,
the
point
i
want
to
end
with
is
that
reapportionment
is
over
essentially
for
the
1970’s.
the
flood
tide
of
litigation
is
past,
but
if
you
change
the
rules,
particularly
the
rules
about
the
strictness
of
the
standard,
you’re
going
to
open
the
floodgates
again.
and
this
case
is
the
kind
of
a
case
that
can
announce
to
the
country
that
there
has
been
no
retreat
for
the
one-man-one-vote
doctrine.
that
the
strict
standards
of
equal
--
of
equal
population
for
the
districts
is
still
required,
and
that
political
structuring
is
not
a
justifiable
excuse
for
not
reaching
that
standard.
and
finally
i
would
say
to
you
this,
that
if
we
are
wrong
as
to
the
standard
of
equality,
if
we
are
wrong,
which
i
hope
we
are
not,
both
for
the
sake
of
this
case
and
for
the
sake
of
the
country,
and
for
the
sake
of
what
will
happen
in
general,
in
terms
of
litigation,
if
we
are
wrong,
then
we
urge
that
this
case
be
remanded
to
the
district
court,
to
take
advantage
of
the
decision
in
the
mahan
case
which
appears
to
--
which
not
appears,
but
which
expressly
gives
to
the
states
the
opportunity
to
loosen
the
strictness
of
deviations
or/of
equality
when
there
is
a
justifiable
basis
for
respect
for
town
lines.
and
here,
if
you
permit,
if
the
district
court
can
find
that
it
can
permit
under
the
circumstances
of
the
case,
a
15%
deviation,
range
of
deviation,
then
we
can
more
carefully
respect
town
lines
in
our
state.
and
for
these
reasons
your
honor,
i
urge
that
the
district
–
that
the
judgment
of
the
district
court
below
be
affirmed.
mr.
robert
a.
satter
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
court
scored
a
stunning
six
sets
in
the
one
man
one
vote
doctrine
in
the
cases
which
enunciated
that
doctrine.
in
the
space
of
a
few
years,
this
court
has
come
close
to
achieving
or
leading
this
country
to
achieve
the
fundamental
purpose
of
that
doctrine
and
has
thereby
enhanced
a
fundamental
civil
right,
namely
the
right
of
each
individual
citizen
to
an
equally
weighted
vote.
and
as
this
court
said
in
reynolds
to
the
extent
that
a
citizen
--
the
citizens’
right
to
vote
is
debased,
he
is
that
much
less
a
citizen.
and
so
these
one
man
one
vote
cases
are
important
and
they
put
us
on
a
high
road
toward
improving
the
quality
of
our
democracy
and
the
passion
and
the
high
hopes
with
which
this
court
started
that
journey
with
baker
against
karr
should
not
play
and
particularly
it
should
not
play
in
light
of
how
close
we
are
to
an
ultimate
success.
mr.
robert
a.
satter
i
think
they
have
that
same
principle,
yes.
whether
people
do
or
do
not
vote
doesn’t
change
the
quality
of
the
--
change
the
necessity
of
having
equally
weighted
votes
or
giving
people
the
opportunity
to
be
in
districts
where
they
have
an
equal
voice
with
every
other
person.
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
a.
satter
of
course
you
don’t.
i
might
say
in
connecticut
that
the
history
is
that
we
vote
close
to
80%
in
many
of
our
elections
and
in
fact
some
of
our
presidential
elections,
we
have
voted
close
to
90%
and
that’s
a
remarkable
fact
but
it’s
true.
now
why
do
i
say
that
we
have
come
so
close
to
success
in
these
one
man
one
vote
doc
--
in
these
one
man
one
vote
cases.
because
the
facts
are,
that
in
53%
of
the
states,
the
extent
of
a
deviation
is
5%
or
less.
the
range
of
deviation
is
5%
or
less
in
their
--
in
the
reapportionment
of
their
senate
and
47
--
and
in
47%
of
the
states,
the
range
of
deviation
is
5%
or
less
in
the
house,
in
their
lower
house
and
by
range
of
deviation
i
mean
plus
or
minus
to
and
a
half
percent.
now
the
states
did
not
come
to
that
voluntarily.
the
states
were
not
anxious
to
accord
this
extent
of
equality
to
their
citizens’
tree
on
their
own
free
will.
reapportionment
is
a
very
painful
process.
i
know
it
because
i
have
been
in
the
state
legislature
and
i
have
been
in
the
state
legislature
in
which
i
was
required
to
reapportion
myself
and
it
is
a
very
painful
process.
it
is
a
painful
process
whether
the
legislators
are
doing
it
or
whether
others
are
doing
it.
and
the
concern
for
the
equality
of
the
vote,
of
the
individual
citizen
on
the
part
of
the
reapportioners
if
left
to
their
own
devices
is
very
slight,
except
when
this
court
has
required
them
to
do
so.
mr.
robert
a.
satter
we
submitted
a
plan
of
deviation
of
2.16%.
mr.
robert
a.
satter
7.8%,
the
range
of
deviation
is
7.8%
your
honor.
mr.
robert
a.
satter
no,
the
range
from
the
highest
to
the
lowest.
mr.
robert
a.
satter
that
means
that
it
was
plus
3.9
and
approximately
minus
3.9
your
honor.
mr.
robert
a.
satter
oh,
no.
we
don’t
disagree
with
the
figures
at
all.
mr.
robert
a.
satter
no
your
honor.
we
recognize
that
the
range
of
deviation
is
7.8%.
mr.
robert
a.
satter
yes.
mr.
robert
a.
satter
that
was
to
the
house,
yes.
we
make
no
issue
whatever
in
this
respect.
mr.
robert
a.
satter
it’s
not
here.
we
obviously
recognize
--
mr.
robert
a.
satter
i
think
the
figures
that
are
in
the
--
in
a
stipulation
are
correct,
yes
and
that’s
that
i
think
the
court
found.
mr.
robert
a.
satter
not
have
that
argument.
and
so,
may
it
please
the
court,
the
point
i
am
making
is
that
the
process
is
a
painful
one
that
the
rights
of
the
individual
citizen
are
only
going
to
be
protected
by
a
court
having
a
very
firm
and
severe
stand
on
the
requirement
to
achieve
equality.
and
that
thus
the
states
have
to
be
ordered
first,
to
reapportion
and
baker
against
karr
made
that
issue
sufficiently
litigable
for
them
to
realize
they
had
to
and
secondly
that
they
had
to
achieve
equality.
the
reynolds
case
established
the
standard
of
equality
as
equal,
as
practicable.
there
is
no
question
that
it
had
some
caveats
in
it.
it’s
expressly
stated
that
absolute
maximum
exactness
or
precision
was
not
required.
and
taking
the
very
tolerant
approach
that
appeared
to
be
implicit
in
the
reynolds
decision,
the
courts
replied
and
in
the
period
after
1964,
the
pattern
of
approved
deviation
in
state
legislative
cases
ranged
substantially
above
15%.
and
in
fact,
our
record
shows
that
prior
to
1969,
88%
of
our
states
had
deviations
of
over
15%
with
respect
to
their
senate
and
96%
had
deviations
with
respect
to
their
house
of
over
15%.
and
then
came
kirkpatrick,
fortuitously
in
1969,
prior
to
the
1970
census
and
prior
to
the
time
when
the
vast
majority
of
the
states
had
to
reapportion
and
the
kirkpatrick
decision
had
two
parts
to
it.
the
first
part
was
that
the
standard
of
equality
was
going
to
be
strict
as
equal
as
practicable
manner
that
the
states
had
to
seek
to
achieve
precise
mathematical
equality
and
they
were
to
be
permitted
only
those
deviations
in
which
the
variations
were
unavoidable.
and
the
second
aspect
of
it
was
that
virtually
all
excuses
or
justifications
at
least
as
applied
to
congressional
reapportionment,
were
going
to
be
ruled
out.
and
the
states
listened
to
that
and
they
knew
that
this
court
meant
what
it
was
saying
and
they
felt
that
they
had
to
apply
those
rules
in
the
kirkpatrick
case
to
their
own
state
legislative
reapportionment.
they
were
very
attuned
as
all
reapportioning
authorities
are
to
the
nuisances
of
the
language
of
this
court’s
opinion
where
they
can
find
a
escape
hole,
where
they
can
interpret
an
out,
they
will
do
so
because
achieving
equality
is
not
a
high
priority
on
the
part
of
reapportioners.
they
have
other
purposes.
they
do
not
have
purpose
unless
a
court
tells
them
that
they
have
to
have
it,
but
they
read
kirkpatrick
to
say
it
applies
to
us
and
we’re
going
to
listen
to
it
and
we’re
going
to
apply
it
and
that’s
why
we
have
53%
of
the
states
keeping
within
a
deviation
of
5%
or
less.
mr.
robert
a.
satter
how
many
states?
your
honor
its
53%
is
all
but
it
--
what?
mr.
robert
a.
satter
right.
thank
you
your
honor.
and
what
this
has
demonstrated
is
and
i
know
this
line
has
been
said
to
you
so
many
times
it’s
a
frightful
cliché
that
the
life
of
the
law
is
not
logic
but
experience
and
experience
has
proven
the
wisdom
of
justice
brennan’s
statement
in
kirkpatrick
that
a
state
legislature
which
tries
can
achieve
complete
numerical
equality
among
all
of
the
states
districts.
and
this
is
the
answer
to
the
--
this
court's
carping
critics
who
have
run
their
hands
over
an
over
insistence
upon
equality
among
the
districts.
that
is
an
over
insistence
upon
achieving
an
equally
weighted
vote
for
our
citizens
as
if
we
can
ever
have
an
over
insistence
upon
perpetuating
valid
and
important
constitutional
rights
and
that
was
the
purpose
--
mr.
robert
a.
satter
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
a.
satter
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
issues
in
a
reapportionment
case
can
be
framed
as
follows:
one,
the
standard
of
equality
that’s
going
to
be
applied;
two,
the
nature
or
the
type
of
a
rational
state
policy
which
would
justify
deviations
in
excess
of
that
standard;
and
three,
the
tolerable
limits
of
the
deviations,
even
if
they
are
justified.
expressing
or
framing
the
issues
in
that
fashion
sets
a
blueprint
for
the
kinds
of
evidence
necessary
to
prove
a
case
of
this
nature
and
establishes
the
legal
questions
necessary
to
decide
it
and
let
me
endeavor
to
apply
these
principles
to
our
case
before
us.
as
to
the
standard
of
equality,
we
urge
that,
that
continue
to
be
a
strict
as
it
has
been
and
that
the
cause,
that
the
greatest
cause
of
the
success
of
reapportionment
in
the
1970’s
which
i
eluded
to
yesterday
that
50%
of
the
states
have
achieved
a
deviation
of
5%
or
less
is
because
of
the
strictness
of
that
standard.
now,
the
equal
as
practicalable
expression
in
reynolds
is
kind
of
a
wavering
line
and
does
not
state
the
standard
with
sufficient
precision.
i
urge
upon
this
court
to
continue
the
standard
expressed
in
the
kirkpatrick
case,
namely
that
the
states
be
required
to
achieve
as
price
--
as
precise
the
mathematically
quality
as
they
can
and
only
limited
population
variances
which
are
unavoidable
will
be
permitted
unless
they
can
be
justified.
now,
those
words
and
that
standard
are
uncomfortable
to
the
reapportionment.
i
know
because
i
have
been
in
the
back
rooms
with
the
reapportionments.
but
it
is
necessary
that
it'd
be
uncomfortable
for
them
because
the
only
thing
that
assures
a
respect
for
the
constitutional
right
of
the
individual
citizen
to
an
equally
weighted
vote,
the
only
thing
that
assures
a
respect
for
the
constitutional
right
of
the
individual
citizen
to
an
equally
weighted
vote
is
the
language
of
the
opinions
of
this
court.
and
i
urge
that
you
do
not
adopt
the
de
minimis
rule
that
has
been
asked
of
you
by
the
appellants.
certainly,
it
should
not
be
applied
in
this
case
where
the
deviations
are
7.8%,
which
is
in
excess
of
what
50%
of
the
states
have
already
achieved.
and
in
the
cases
which
have
required
that
close
a
deviation,
less
than
5%,
they
over
and
over
again
say
in
their
opinions,
the
lower
court
say
there
is
no
de
minimis
rule.
and
as
it
was
pointed
out
in
kirkpatrick,
once
you
establish
a
de
minimis
rule
that
becomes
the
target
at
which
the
reapportioners
will
aim
at,
and
not
at
precise
equality.
moreover,
we
urge
you
not
to
adopt
any
presumption
of
constitutionality
in
this
case
as
the
appellants
have
urged
upon
you.
essentially,
the
argument
is
the
same.
the
great
expansion
of
civil
rights
in
this
country,
and
now
by
civil
rights,
i
mean
the
rights
that
have
derived
from
the
equal
protections
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment,
the
rights
that
have
come
from
the
first
amendment,
freedom
of
speech
and
freedom
of
religion,
and
the
rights
that
come
from
the
other
amendments
to
the
constitution,
in
my
judgment,
derived
their
fundamental
source
from
three
basis
causes.
first;
the
standing
of
citizens
to
sue,
that
was
terribly
important.
giving
a
standing
to
citizens
to
sue
for
these
important
rights
and
as
kind
of
a
subdivision
of
that,
a
kind
of
expansion
of
the
whole
notion
under
the
federal
rules
of
class
actions.
secondly;
the
availability
of
lawyers
and
the
willingness
of
lawyers
to
take
these
cases;
and
thirdly,
not
necessarily
an
absence
of
the
presumption
of
constitutionality
in
these
basic
civil
rights
cases,
but
at
least
a
kind
of
dip
in
the
presumption
of
constitutionality.
in
order
to
lower
the
threshold
of
the
burden
of
proof
upon
the
plaintiffs
for
them
to
establish
a
prima
facie
case,
and
then
require
the
states
to
come
forward
in
these
basic
civil
rights
cases
and
explain
or
to
justify
why
they
have
created
an
unequal
treatment.
and
i
would
trust
that
that
basic
kind
of
underlying
rule
that
you
have
adopted
in
these
basic
civil
rights
cases
would
not
be
changed
in
this
kind
of
a
case
or
in
any
of
the
civil
rights
cases.
now,
let’s
apply
the
standard
of
equality
to
the
case
before
us.
the
deviation
in
this
case,
the
range
of
deviation
which
i
previously
defined
from
top
to
bottom
was
7.8%.
a
plan
was
submitted
by
the
plaintiffs
showing
that
the
deviation
in
this
case
could
have
been
2.6%,
the
range
of
deviation
could
have
been
2.6%.
that
plan
was
based
on
the
same
census
material
as
was
available
to
the
board.
it
was
prepared
by
an
unquestioned
expert.
the
expert
and
the
plan
itself
was
known
to
the
appellants,
was
given
to
them
at
least
two
weeks
before
the
trial
in
accordance
within
a
pretrial
order,
a
pretrial
conference
order
of
the
trial
judge.
the
plaintiff
said
--
excuse
me,
the
appellants
said
the
opportunity
to
depose
the
plaintiff’s
expert
before
trial.
they
had
the
opportunity
to
cross-examine
him
at
trial
as
to
whether
or
not
the
plan
that
was
submitted
indicated
that
there
was
an
opportunity
to
avoid
the
deviation
in
the
board
plan.
and
finally,
there
was
a
finding
by
the
court
or
at
least
an
implied
finding
by
the
court
that
it
had
accept
it
as
a
reliable
demonstration
of
how
greater
equality
could’ve
been
achieved
with
the
materials
on
hand,
and
the
court
so
expressly
stated
that.
and
this
is
the
way
these
cases
have
been
tried.
they
where
tried
in
swann
that
way.
a
party
puts
in
a
plan
that
shows
that
greater
deviations
are
possible,
and
the
deviations
in
the
plan
are
avoidable,
and
that’s
a
perfectly
litigable
issue.
it
is
subjected
to
objective
proof,
namely
the
use
of
the
census
data,
the
pretrial
conference
can
require
that
any
plans
which
are
going
to
be
submitted
by
any
party
shall
be
provided
to
the
other
parties
for
examination.
their
witnesses
shall
be
determined
and
you
have
a
litigable
issue
upon
which
a
court
on
the
basis
of
objective
evidence
can
find
an
answer
and
render
a
finding.
and
in
this
case,
the
court
found
that
the
plan
of
the
plaintiffs
was
a
reliable,
valid,
and
accurate
expression
of
the
possibility
for
reducing
of
--
reducing
the
deviations.
now,
let
me
turn
for
a
moment
to
the
argument
made
by
the
appellants
that
the
average
population
of
census
units
has
some
meaning
and
there
is
some
opportunity
to
as
an
object
of
standard
as
to
what
the
court
should
aim
at.
that
average
population
of
census
units
is
a
figure
with
no
meaning
whatever,
what
is
it?
you
take
the
total
population
of
a
state,
you
take
a
haphazard
number
which
represents
all
the
census
units
in
a
particular
census,
namely
the
block
groups,
the
enumeration
districts,
etcetera.
you
divide
them
together,
you
divide
one
to
the
other,
and
that's
your
average
census
unit;
average
population
of
a
census
unit.
it
means
nothing
statistically.
it
means
nothing
in
the
objective
utility.
it
has
no
operative
utility
in
the
development
of
the
plan
because
the
important
thing
is
what
is
the
size
of
the
lowest
census
units.
districts
--
legislative
districts
are
put
together
by
various
census
units.
you
want
to
know
how
many
there
are
of
a
small
--
of
the
small
population
units
and
compare
that
number
with
the
number
of
districts
which
have
to
be
made.
and
here,
there
were
a
151
districts,
but
there
were
over
--
there
were
240
of
the
census
units
which
where
below
300.
and
in
fact,
the
plan
which
we
developed
showed
that
only
four
of
those
census
units
--
over
--
only
four
of
the
districts
with
the
same
census
material
had
to
be
over
200
people.
now,
the
question
is
having
arrived
at
the
fact
that
the
deviations
are
avoidable,
is
there
any
justification
for
them?
the
district
court
found
that
partisan
political
structuring
was
a
substantial
cause
of
the
numerical
deviation
of
the
board
plan
here.
“if
partisan
political
balancing
were
eliminated
as
a
factor,
a
closer
approach
to
perfect
equality
could
be
achieved.”
now
the
question
is,
is
political
structuring
a
legitimate
state
interest
which
justifies
these
deviations?
and
we
assert
to
your
honors
that
it
is
not.
it
is
not
listed
among
the
permissible
justifications
in
the
reynolds
case.
it
is
expressly
rejected
in
the
kirkpatrick
case
where
this
court
said
practical
politics
cannot
justify
population
disparities.
the
consideration
of
political
party
strength
was
deemed
to
be
in
quotes
“in
apposite”
in
the
ely
v.
klahr
case.
this
so-called
political
balancing
doesn’t
serve
a
governmental
purpose
such
as
a
respect
for
town
lines
where
you
have
towns
who
have
an
interest
in
the
state
legislature.
it
is
not
supported
by
any
state
constitution
or
any
state
statute
and
finally,
it
is
much
too
wide
in
avenue
of
subterfuge,
to
be
allowed
as
a
justification
because
it
will
always
be
brought
out,
because
that
is
always
the
reason
for
any
deviation
that
a
plan
gets,
that
that
the
plan
has.
it
is
not
an
objective
standard
and
if
allowed,
a
political
balancing,
a
political
compromise,
if
all
these
political
business
is
ever
allowed
as
a
justification
for
a
deviation,
it
will
press
this
court
to
the
tolerable
limits
as
to
what
it
will
accept
because
it
will
always
be
paraded
out
before
you.
now,
what
is
it,
well,
what
further
is
the
reason
why
you
should
reject
it
as
a
rational
state
policy?
remember,
in
order
to
achieve
it,
you
in
the
kind
of
political
structure
we're
talking
about,
you
take
the
total
statewide
vote
for
each
political
party
in
all
of
these
individual
district
elections,
and
you
say
that
the
percentage
of
the
total
vote
in
each
of
these
individual
election,
that
total
is
to
be
the
same
percentage
as
the
political
party
candidates
win
for
the
--
win
in
the
legislature.
now,
that
number
of
adding
up,
that
all
of
these
individual
districts,
single
district
elections
is
meaningless
because
these
individual
single
district
elections
are
disparate
and
they
go
off
on
a
many
different
reasons.
on
local
tax
questions,
on
a
question
of
sex
education
in
the
schools,
on
the
question
of,
i
know
of
an
attorney
who
lost
an
election,
representative
candidate
because
he
represented
a
black
person
in
the
purchase
of
a
house
in
a
local
town.
and
add
up
those
numbers
in
these
individual
single
district
elections
and
say
that
that
total
has
any
meaning,
in
my
judgment
is
like
adding
up
apples,
and
ancient
hockey
sticks
and
deflated
basketballs.
it
doesn’t
mean
anything.
but
because
it’s
an
irrational
number,
it
also
creates
your
rational
consequences.
now,
this
marvelous
cartoon
that’s
sitting
before
you,
during
the
course
of
my
argument,
reveals
what
i’m
talking
about.
if
you’re
going
to
take
the
excess
plurality
of
a
particular
political
party
in
a
particular
district,
a
section
of
the
state
and
say
that
that
excess
plurality
can
be
the
basis
for
his
--
for
that
party
electing
candidates
in
another
part
of
the
state,
you
got
to
wiggle
and
jiggle
and
ferret
it
out,
parties,
candidates,
party
votes
all
over
the
state,
and
that
is
what
happens.
that’s
a
district.
this
is
assembly
district
number
13,
this
is
number
14
and
this
is
12
and
this
is
14,
that’s
an
indecent
piece
of
drawing.
this
is
what
could
have
if
you
are
interested
in
seeking
some
form
of
rationality.
that’s
the
same
districts,
but
they’re
irrationally
arranged.
this
is
another
indecent
district
in
windsor
and
bloomfield,
and
that’s
the
way
--
this
is
the
way
that
that
district
could’ve
been
rearranged.
mr.
robert
a.
satter
i
think
that
to
design
a
scheme
of
rea
--
a
proportion
representation?
mr.
robert
a.
satter
yes,
if
you
took
the
whole
state
instead
of
one
district,
i
would
not
object
to
that.
i
mean
i
think
i
cannot
see
it.
mr.
robert
a.
satter
that
is
right.
but
the
problem
is
--
mr.
robert
a.
satter
it
sounds
like
it,
yes.
but
in
fact,
it
results
in
a
distortion
of
the
districts
to
a
frightful
extent.
it
justifies
the
mutalization
of
the
individual
districts.
mr.
robert
a.
satter
it
attempts
to
approach
it,
yes.
mr.
robert
a.
satter
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
a.
satter
oh
yes.
they
are
exactly
the
same.
mr.
robert
a.
satter
oh,
absolutely.
the
same
geographic
area
is
covered
in
the
these,
but
this
is
what
happened
and
the
consequence
of
this
is,
is
that
least
that
you
get
a
questioning
of
the
fitness
of
the
whole
reapportionment
system,
and
somewhat,
a
disrespect
for
the
whole
legitimacy
of
the
plan.
now,
the
point
i
want
to
end
with
is
that
reapportionment
is
over
essentially
for
the
1970’s.
the
flood
tide
of
litigation
is
past,
but
if
you
change
the
rules,
particularly
the
rules
about
the
strictness
of
the
standard,
you’re
going
to
open
the
floodgates
again.
and
this
case
is
the
kind
of
a
case
that
can
announce
to
the
country
that
there
has
been
no
retreat
for
the
one-man-one-vote
doctrine.
that
the
strict
standards
of
equal
--
of
equal
population
for
the
districts
is
still
required,
and
that
political
structuring
is
not
a
justifiable
excuse
for
not
reaching
that
standard.
and
finally
i
would
say
to
you
this,
that
if
we
are
wrong
as
to
the
standard
of
equality,
if
we
are
wrong,
which
i
hope
we
are
not,
both
for
the
sake
of
this
case
and
for
the
sake
of
the
country,
and
for
the
sake
of
what
will
happen
in
general,
in
terms
of
litigation,
if
we
are
wrong,
then
we
urge
that
this
case
be
remanded
to
the
district
court,
to
take
advantage
of
the
decision
in
the
mahan
case
which
appears
to
--
which
not
appears,
but
which
expressly
gives
to
the
states
the
opportunity
to
loosen
the
strictness
of
deviations
or/of
equality
when
there
is
a
justifiable
basis
for
respect
for
town
lines.
and
here,
if
you
permit,
if
the
district
court
can
find
that
it
can
permit
under
the
circumstances
of
the
case,
a
15%
deviation,
range
of
deviation,
then
we
can
more
carefully
respect
town
lines
in
our
state.
and
for
these
reasons
your
honor,
i
urge
that
the
district
–
that
the
judgment
of
the
district
court
below
be
affirmed.
