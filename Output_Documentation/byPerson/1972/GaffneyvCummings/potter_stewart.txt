justice
potter
stewart
mr.
dixon,
do
i
understand
your
argument
to
be
just
--
you
told
us
a
couple
of
minutes
ago
that
you
cannot
rely
on
the
virginia
cases
decided
last
week
--
justice
potter
stewart
for
the
very
reason
--
justice
potter
stewart
for
just
a
moment,
in
fact,
so
i
can
ask
my
question,
so
i’ll
be
sure
understand
it.
justice
potter
stewart
you
cannot
rely
on
it
for
the
very
reason
that
you
have
in
order
to
approach
to
a
maximum
numerical
proportionality,
you
have
disregarded
state
boundaries
and
town
boundaries
and
so
on,
is
that
it?
and
therefore
you
can’t
rationalize
the
tiny
deviations
that
remain
in
terms
of
any
legitimate
state
interest
as
virginia
could
in
respecting
local
political
boundaries,
is
that
your
argument
or
just
i
misunderstand
it?
justice
potter
stewart
alright.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
the
point
is
though,
the
more
a
state
in
order
to
approach
numerical
perfection
disregards
its
other
state
interest
unless
it
can
justify
any
tiny
deviations
in
terms
of
any
state
interest,
isn’t
that
correct,
because
it
has
disregarded
them?
justice
potter
stewart
oh,
you're
talking
about
benevolent
gerrymandering,
aren’t
you?
justice
potter
stewart
and
the
courts
never
held
that
the
ordinary
kind
of
gerrymandering
as
a
justiciable
question
or
any
business
of
ours
in
any
of
these
reapportionment
cases
so
far
but
to
whatever
the
ultimate
answer
to
that
question
might
be,
your
point
is
that
benevolent
gerrymandering
at
least
is
neutral
that
it
doesn’t
make
it
otherwise
a
valid
plan
invalid,
is
that
it?
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
satter,
what
is
your
--
what
are
your
figures
as
to
the
deviation
here,
in
this
case?
justice
potter
stewart
no,
as
to
the
deviation
that
was
struck
down
by
the
district
court?
justice
potter
stewart
the
range,
meaning
what,
the
maximum?
justice
potter
stewart
now
what
does
that
mean?
justice
potter
stewart
so
you
don’t
disagree
with
the
figures?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
many
in
the
cases,
the
parties
can’t
seem
to
get
together
on
the
figures.
justice
potter
stewart
from
a
maximum
of
3.93
to
a
minimum
of
3.9
in
percentage
points?
justice
potter
stewart
and
the
average,
do
you
agree
that
for
all
the
districts
and
the
house,
that’s
1.9
and
the
median
1.8?
justice
potter
stewart
at
least
we
don’t
have
that
kind
of
an
argument
in
this
case?
justice
potter
stewart
26.
justice
potter
stewart
some
are
between
26
