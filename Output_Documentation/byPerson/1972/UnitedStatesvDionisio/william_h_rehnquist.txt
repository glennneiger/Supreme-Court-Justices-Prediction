mr.
crowley,
i
take
it,
you
wouldn’t
say
that
probable
cause
is
required
for
either
a
grand
jury
or
a
counsel
if
trying
a
case
before
a
petty
jury
to
follow
a
particular
line
of
inquiry
where
the
witness
were
all
that
is
being
sized
ordinarily
--
ordinary
oral
question
and
answer
testimony.
justice
william

how
about
before
a
grand
jury?
simply
oral
questions
and
answers
without
any
voiceprint
problem
involved?
justice
william

your
argument
turns
on
the
difference
between
a
voiceprint,
an
ordinary
question
and
answer
testimony.

perhaps
i’m
pursuing
into
an

where
neither
you
nor
i
at

certainly
i
don’t
know
very
much
but
certainly
what
one
technique
of
narcosynthesis
and
psychotherapy
is
administration
of
pentathol
or
something
like
that
to
get
a
man
to
speak
where
he
does
not
in
fact
want
to
and
where
his
unconscious
takes
over.
if
you
rigorously
pursue
that
distinction
between
will
and
not,
i
am
not
so
sure
which
side
of
the
thing
that
the
speaking
comes
out
of?
