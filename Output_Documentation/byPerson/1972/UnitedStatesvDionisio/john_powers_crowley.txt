mr.
john
powers
crowley
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
believe
the
statement
of
facts
as
given
by
the
solicitor
is
generally
insufficient.
i
would
like
to
add
one
further
thing
which
i
think
i
had
some
dimension
to
the
problems
here
presented
with.
the
witness,
dionisio,
refused
to
give
voice
exemplars,
a
witness,
charles
bishop
smith
during
the
same
investigation
also
refused
to
give
voice
exemplars.
mr.
smith
after
being
held
in
contempt
and
after
the
seventh
circuit
had
reversed
his
contempt
on
--
in
the
same
opinion
as
here
below.
mr.
smith
was
indicted
by
the
special
february
1971
grand
jury
and
i
believe
it
was,
i
expect,
after
the
governments’
petition
for
certiorari
had
been
filed
in
this
case.
mr.
smith
was
indicted
by
this
grand
jury
for
alleged
violations
of
the
federal
laws
probably
gambling.
mr.
and
the
solicitor
sought
leave
of
court
and
obtained
pursuant
to
rule
60,
the
dismissal
of
the
petition
against
mr.
smith
on
the
grounds
that
his
exemplar,
his
voice
exemplar
was
no
longer
desired
since
he
had
been
indicted.
the
wiretap
evidence,
which
formed
the
basis
for
mr.
smith’s
indictment
and
presumably
formed
the
basis
for
the
request
for
the
grand
jury
exemplars
was
found
by
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
northern
district
of
illinois
in
united
states
versus
smith
et
al
to
have
been
unlawfully
obtained
and
not
properly
authorized.
that
decision,
the
government
has
sought
appeal
from
that
decision.
if
that
decision
is
affirmed
by
the
seventh
circuit,
of
course,
then
mr.
dionisio
would
have
an
additional
reason
for
a
refusal
to
furnish
the
exemplar
under
the
principles
set
forth
in
this
case
and
by
this
court
in
gilbert
versus
united
states.
it
is
the
basis
of
the
respondent’s
argument
--
mr.
john
powers
crowley
it
is
in
the
seventh
circuit
as
of
--
mr.
john
powers
crowley
briefs
are
filed
--
it
is
has
not
been
set
for
argument
it
is
anticipated
mr.
justice
brennan
that
that
case
will
be
argued
in
january,
in
the
january
session
of
the
court.
mr.
john
powers
crowley
yes,
we
would
guess
so.
mr.
john
powers
crowley
i
most
certainly
will.
mr.
charles
bishop
smith
appeared
before
this
grand
jury
with
mr.
dionisio.
mr.
smith
refused
to
give
voice
exemplars.
he
was
held
in
contempt.
his
contempt
was
reversed
by
the
seventh
circuit
in
this
same
opinion.
mr.
john
powers
crowley
subsequent
to
the
filing
of
the
petition
for
certiorari,
mr.
smith
along
with
approximately
18
or
19
others
was
indicted
by
this
special
february
1971
grand
jury.
subsequent
to
that
indictment,
the
solicitor
sought
and
obtained
leave
of
this
court
pursuant
to
rule
60
to
dismiss
the
petition
for
certiorari.
so,
mr.
smith’s
counsel
and
other
counsel
in
the
case
filed
motions
to
suppress
the
wiretap
evidence
which
formed
the
basis
for
mr.
smith’s
indictment
and
formed
the
basis
for
the
grand
jury
inquiry
in
this
case
originally.
the
district
court
granted
those
motions
to
suppress
on
the
basis
that
the
orders
authorizing
the
wiretaps
were
not
lawfully
obtained.
unless
your
honor
wants
me
to,
i
won't
go
into
the
merits
of
that
decision.
i
don’t
think
that’s
properly
before
this
court
but
the
--
mr.
john
powers
crowley
mr.
dionisio
was
never
indicted
by
this
special
grand
jury.
mr.
john
powers
crowley
that
is
correct;
that
is
correct.
mr.
john
powers
crowley
motions
to
suppress.
mr.
john
powers
crowley
by
the
district
court
after
indictment.
mr.
john
powers
crowley
the
government
appealed
that.
mr.
john
powers
crowley
it
is
pending
in
the
seventh
circuit
court
of
appeals
and
it’s
reflected
in
the
--
that
is
reflected
in
my
brief
under
the
statement
on
page
3
that
it’s
pending
in
the
court
of
appeals
--
mr.
john
powers
crowley
no
he
had
--
well,
was
he
was
not
given,
he
--
no,
he
has
not
raised
the
point,
assuming
just
for
the
purposes
of
argument
that
this
court
holds
that
mr.
dionisio
was
not
protected
under
the
fourth
amendment
just
to
give
voice
exemplars
per
se.
i
believe
that
under
this
court’s
opinion
in
gilbert,
that
mr.
dionisio
would
have
a
right
to
refuse
to
give
the
voice
exemplars
alleging
that
the
evidence
upon
which
the
grand
jury
sought
the
exemplars
was
unconstitutionally
obtained.
at
least
what
it
might
constitute
just
cause
for
refusal
to
answer.
mr.
john
powers
crowley
no
your
honor.
if
it
reverses
the
seventh
circuit,
mr.
dionisio
would
then,
i
assume,
be
given
an
opportunity
to
appear
again
in
the
district
court
in
which
he
could
raise
the
issue
that
the
evidence
which
the
grand
jury
sought
to
compare
at
and
sought
to
compare
it
--
compel
the
exemplar
had
been
unconstitutionally
obtained
and
would
appear
to
be
just
cause
for
--
mr.
john
powers
crowley
i
think
it
would
your
honor,
i
would
your
honor
but
i
think
then
mr.
dionisio
would
have
other
collateral
proceedings
available
to
him.
mr.
john
powers
crowley
go
to
the
grand
jury
and
again
refuse
to
give
the
exemplars,
i
think
he
have
to
do
that
on
other
grounds,
on
another
grounds.
mr.
john
powers
crowley
without
binding
--
your
honor
again,
i
--
looking
into
the
future
as
to
what
i
would
do
or
what
his
counsel
at
that
time
would
do,
i
would
assume
that
our
--
a
procedure
similar
to
that
would
have
to
be
followed
in
order
to
protect
his
record,
and
to
comply
with
the
order
of
this
court.
mr.
john
powers
crowley
no
i’m
not,
no
i’m
not
your
honor,
no
i’m
not.
it
is
the
position
of
the
respondent
here
that
the
decision
of
the
seventh
circuit
does
not
as
contended
by
the
government
present
a
novel
issue.
it
has
been
law,
in
hale
versus
henkel
that
the
fourth
amendment
applies
to
grand
jury
proceeding.
in
hale
versus
henkel
this
court
held
or
struck
a
subpoena
requirement
production
of
documentary
evidence
before
a
grand
jury
as
the
overbroad
in
violation
of
the
fourth
amendment.
it
is
also
interesting
to
know
that
this
court’s
decision
in
hale
versus
henkel
as
did
the
decision
of
the
seventh
circuit
below,
this
court
indicated
in
hale
versus
henkel
that
it
might
very
well
appear
at
some
future
time
in
the
grand
jury
proceeding
that
the
request
for
this
overbroad
production
of
documentary
evidence
might
very
well
be
a
reasonable
request
and
therefore
reasonable
within
the
meaning
of
the
fourth
amendment
and
that
the
person
then
could
be
compelled
to
produce
the
papers.
what
the
government
would
ask
this
court
to
hold
is
that
the
fourth
amendment’s
application
to
grand
jury
proceeding
applies
solely
to
the
production
of
documentary
evidence.
we
submit
that
to
place
this
limitation
upon
the
fourth
amendment
is
to
give
an
unduly
restrictive
meaning
to
the
fourth
amendment.
what
the
government
--
if
their
position
is
sustained
here,
what
they
would
then
allow
the
grand
jury
to
do
would
be
to
do
under
the
ages
of
a
simple
grand
jury
subpoena
to
violate
the
fourth
amendment
where
normal
investigative
procedures
of
law
enforcement
at
agencies
could
not
do.
mr.
john
powers
crowley
mr.
chief
justice
they
have
in
the
sense
of
their
--
the
broadness
of
the
scope
of
the
investigation,
the
admissibility
before
the
grand
jury
of
hearsay
evidences
carried
by
this
court
in
costello
and
many
other
cases
that
the
grand
jury
may
--
its
investigation
may
take
many,
many
different
channels
and
go
in
many,
many
different
areas,
but
still
the
grand
jury
must
--
the
grand
jury
in
its
investigation
cannot,
because
it
wishes
to
investigate,
cannot
violate
the
privileges
under
the
fourth
amendment.
if
--
mr.
john
powers
crowley
i
think
--
mr.
john
powers
crowley
mr.
chief
justice,
i
think
it
is
a
distinction
without
a
difference.
yes,
in
davis
--
mr.
john
powers
crowley
but
i
think
in
this
case
--
if
this
court
--
if
we
take
that
analogy
then
all
that
would
have
been
required
in
davis
to
legalize
the
grand
jury
are
or
the
fingerprint.
if
the
situation
had
been
reversed
rather
than
the
dragnet
detention
in
davis
where
the
police
went
up
and
took
into
custody
many,
many
young
blacks
in
the
community.
if
they
did
--
instead
of
doing
that
caused
subpoenas
to
--
grand
jury
subpoenas
to
be
served
on
every
young
black
in
the
community,
call
him
before
the
grand
jury
and
forced
him
to
give
his
fingerprints
before
the
grand
jury,
i
submit
that
the
invidious
nature
would
still
be
present.
and
that
the
grand
jury
would
be
violating
the
individual
fourth
amendment
rights
just
as
much
as
the
unlawful
police
detention
in
which
the
fingerprinting
was
a
product
of
that
unlawful
detention
because
it
is
true
that
the
grand
jury
can
issue
a
subpoena
to
compel
the
appearance
of
anyone
before
it.
however,
the
grand
jury
cannot
issue
a
subpoena
to
compel
the
production
of
things
before
it
without
regard
to
the
fourth
amendment.
and
i
think
by
analogy,
proposed
rule
41,
new
federal
rules
of
criminal
procedure
provides
that
applications
can
be
made
to
magistrates
to
compel
individuals
to
submit
to
identification
procedures
such
as
suggested
here,
such
as
voiceprints,
fingerprints,
etcetera.
however,
in
applying
to
a
magistrate
for
such
an
order,
the
agency
or
the
government
applying
to
the
magistrate
must
submit
papers
to
show
probable
cause
and
reasonable
grounds
before
the
magistrate
will
issue
such
an
order.
now,
grand
juries,
i
think
are
subject
generally
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
district
courts
and
to
say
that
the
grand
jury
then
would
have
greater
subpoena
power
than
the
district
court,
i
think
is
to
ignore
the
function
of
the
grand
jury
we
can
compel
for
example
the
attendance
of
witnesses
before
any
district
court
in
the
united
states
by
proper
service
of
the
subpoena.
but
we
could
not
compel
that
person
in
a
--
to
compel
him
to
appear
before
the
district
court
in
a
case
on
trial,
and
i
don’t
think
then
could
compel
him
to
give
voice
identification,
handwriting
exemplars
or
whatever
other
physical
characteristic
be
required.
i
think
that
--
yes.
mr.
john
powers
crowley
no,
it
is
not
probable
cause
but
it
must
be
questions
that
are
relevant
in
material
to
the
inquiry
and
there
must
be
some
showing
of
relevancy
in
materiality
to
the
issues
at
trial
before
the
court
will
allow
counsel
to
question
into
an
area
that
does
not
have
immediate
appearance
of
relevance.
mr.
john
powers
crowley
i
think
there
your
honor
we
are
seeking
solely
to
testimony
and
absent
a
fifth
amendment
question.
i
don’t
think
we
have
the
same
principles
we
have
involved
here.
mr.
john
powers
crowley
i
think
there
is
a
substantial
difference.
mr.
john
powers
crowley
yes
it
is.
mr.
john
powers
crowley
then,
there
is
another
problem
that
maybe
presented,
there
may
be
a
violation
of
the
fourth
amendment
if
the
grand
jury,
if
it
can
be
established,
i
think
that
we
have
here,
that
there
was
no
reasonable
grounds
to
bring
this
man
before
the
grand
jury
and
he
was
only
called
before
the
grand
jury
not
asked
any
substantive
questions
in
the
regard
to
their
investigation
but
merely
as
a
(voice
overlap)
to
obtain
--
mr.
john
powers
crowley
not
the
--
not
eliminate,
no
you
do
not.
once
a
grand
jury
subpoena
calling
for
the
attendance
of
a
person
before
the
grand
jury
which
is
all
the
subpoena
is
called
for.
the
government
speaks
in
terms
of
that
these
subpoenas
were
narrowly
drawn
when
calling
for
--
mr.
john
powers
crowley
i’m
sorry
mr.
justice.
mr.
john
powers
crowley
i
do
not
believe,
you
do
know.
mr.
john
powers
crowley
i
do
not
believe
that
we
would
be
faced
here
with
the
voiceprint
type
of
identification
because
my
understanding
of
the
voiceprint
that
this
would
--
taking
your
voice
down
on
tape
would
not
give
the
necessary
fidelity
that
would
allow
comparison
to
the
other
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
john
powers
crowley
i
think
the
complaint
would
be
similar
to
the
complaint
here
that
if
the
witness
--
mr.
john
powers
crowley
yes,
move
the
sub
--
no
i
couldn’t
--
i
couldn’t
do
anything
then
your
honor
but
if
i
were
subsequently
indicted
and
this
evidence
that
i
gave
before
the
grand
jury
was
sought
to
be
used
against
me
for
the
purposes
of
that
identification
rather
than
used
against
me
as
is
common
for
the
--
mr.
john
powers
crowley
i
don’t
think
i
could
move
to
quash
the
indictment
your
honor.
i
think
i
could
move
to
suppress
the
evidence
that
has
been
obtained.
mr.
john
powers
crowley
no
your
honor,
it
is
not.
mr.
john
powers
crowley
there
is
not.
we
have
a
completely
different
situation
here.
this
man
is
being
compelled
under
threat
of
imprisonment
to
give
voice
exemplars.
in
the
other
case
he
is
not
being
compelled
under
threat
of
imprisonment,
he
had
been
--
he
just
ordered
before
the
grand
jury,
answered
questions.
if
he
were
to
answer,
just
be
called
before
--
mr.
john
powers
crowley
in
this
--
in
your
case,
he
could
take
the
fifth
amendment
and
i
don’t
think
there
would
be
a
--
i
think
it’ll
be
a
perfectly
valid
claim
of
the
fifth
amendment.
mr.
john
powers
crowley
in
this
case
he
would
not
and
you’re
hypothetically
correct.
mr.
john
powers
crowley
well,
your
honor
i
think
under
the
fourth
amendment
that
the
physical
identifying
characteristics
such
as
in
schmerber
versus
california
recognized
that
the
taking
of
the
blood
sample
was
protected
under
the
fourth
amendment.
if
we
take
dionisio,
and
dionisio
and
20
others
are
compelled
before
to
appear
before
the
grand
jury
--
properly
compelled
to
appear
before
the
grand
jury
and
then
compelled
under
threat
of
contempt
to
furnish
blood,
we
have
the
schmerber
case
before
it.
they
could
similarly
be
called
under
the
government’s
theory
that
the
government
has
prevailed
in
this
case,
dragnet
subpoenas
could
constantly
be
used
to
investigate,
to
bring
people
before
the
grand
jury
to
compel
him
to
give
blood,
to
compel
him
to
give
hair
samples,
to
compel
him
to
give
semen,
compel
him
to
give
voiceprints,
the
handwriting
as
the
case
in
mara.
and
what
you
are
then
authorizing
the
grand
jury
to
do
is
allow
the
government
through
the
vehicle
of
the
grand
jury
and
in
violation
of
rule
41
of
the
federal
rules
of
criminal
procedure
just
to
bypass
the
magistrate
and
not
ask
the
magistrate
for
the
order
because
there
they
must
show
a
probable
cause
and
it
is
recognized
under
the
rule
that
that
probable
cause
for
that
type
of
compulsive
testimonial
identification
must
be
--
must
--
that
the
compulsion
for
testimonial
identification
must
be
supported
by
probable
cause.
but
then
to
allow
the
grand
jury
to
turn
around
and
do
the
exactly
the
same
thing,
we
submit
is
just
as
much
protected
by
the
fourth
amendment
as
it
would
be
protected
in
an
application
to
a
magistrate.
we
submit
that
these
--
for
example,
the
voice
exemplar
or
the
person’s
voice
as
is
his
handwriting
which
would
be
covered
of
course
by
counsel
for
the
respondent
mara,
are
not
those
types
of
physical
characteristics
which
are
necessarily
exposed
to
plain
view,
such
as
a
person’s
stature
or
his
facial
characteristic.
a
person
can
choose
to
speak
or
not
to
speak
and
to
do
that
requires
a
conscious
act
of
will,
something
that
he
possesses
within
himself
and
requires
his
act
of
will
to
expose
to
the
general
public
whereas
his
facial
characteristics
are
exposed
to
the
general
public
and
to
everyone
concerned
without
any
active
will
on
his
part
unless
he
would
have
become
a
permit.
mr.
john
powers
crowley
yes,
mr.
justice.
mr.
john
powers
crowley
i
think
that’d
be
the
physical
characteristics
as
just
as
his
face.
mr.
john
powers
crowley
it
would
react
in
--
well,
that
would
be
such
as
the
person
putting
on
a
coat
to
see
if
a
coat
fits
it
which
has
been
approved
by
this
court
but
i
think
your
honor
that
they
go
to
things
such
as
that
go
to
a
--
to
a
mere
physical
characteristics
of
a
person.
for
example
--
mr.
john
powers
crowley
this
--
possibly
be
done,
yes.
because
if
a
--
within
a
reasonable
limitations
of
decency,
i
would
suppose
yes.
mr.
john
powers
crowley
right.
but
to
[laughter]
just
i
think
that
if
a
man
for
example
refute,
when
i
talk
about
the
act
of
will,
if
a
man
refused
there
to
exhibit
his
arms
to
see
if
there
were
a
tattoo,
his
coat
or
his
shirt
could
be
removed
from
him
by
someone
else.
he
could
not
by
his
own
act
completely
hide
from
anyone
else
what
appeared,
the
tattoo
on
his
arm
because
others
could
take
his
coat
off
and
the
tattoo
would
then
become
visible.
but
no
act
of
anyone
else
could
force
a
man
to
speak.
and
i
think
that
there
is
a
valid
distinction
there.
mr.
john
powers
crowley
yes,
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
mr.
john
powers
crowley
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
i
--
but
it's
certainly
an
area
beyond
my
expertise
but
it
is
my
understanding
just
generally
that
the
speaking,
there
is
a
speaking
of
with
the
release
of
all
inhibitions
and
to
speak
what
is
in
the
subconscious,
to
answer
questions
that
are
in
this
--
that
the
answers
to
which
are
in
the
subconscious
and
that
the
man
in
answering
the
question
will
not
color
his
answer
and
theoretically
will
speak
the
truth
to
the
question
put.
i
don’t
know
if
those
drugs
administer
--
i
just
don’t
know
if
those
drugs
administered
to
a
person
overcome
his
entire
will
so
that
he
speaks
against
his
will.
i
don’t
believe
they
do.
i
believe
that
the
answer
may
not
have
the
inhibitions
given
by
the
conscious
mind
but
i
--
and
be
free
of
that
--
of
those
--
of
that
conscious
mind
and
be
dictated
solely
by
the
subconscious.
but
i
don’t
think
that
the
administration
of
the
drugs
themselves,
a
fortiori
just
brings
forth
a
vocal
response.
and
i
think
that
in
--
if
we
were
to
take
that
position,
if
persons
were
dragnet
and
i
think
here
the
evidence
shows
that
there
was
a
dragnet
similar
to
that
in
davis
that
20
people
were
called
before
the
grand
jury
and
that
absolutely
no
showing
whatsoever
as
to
the
reasonableness
of
their
being
called
before
the
grand
jury
but
i
don’t
think
the
grand
jury
has
to
show
that
but
the
reasonableness
of
the
grand
jury’s
asking
for
their
voice
exemplars.
mr.
john
powers
crowley
no
i
don’t,
no
i
don't
your
honor
that
that
--
mr.
john
powers
crowley
i
think
the
record
here
is
this
as
the
solicitor
points
out
would
indicate
that
the
witness
when
he
appeared
before
the
grand
jury
refused
to
testify
in
the
grand
jury
and
at
in
--
he
was
never
requested
to
give
the
exemplars
in
front
of
the
grand
jury
per
se.
but
i
think
that
there
the
solicitor’s
interpretation
of
the
record
here
is
reasonably
correct.
and
we
did
not
raise
that
issue
below.
the
seventh
circuit
mentioned
it
in
a
footnote
primarily
in
relation
to
the
authority
of
the
grand
juries
to
appoint
agents
to
hear
a
testimony
but
that
is
not
raised
in
the
district
court.
it
was
not
raised
in
the
court
of
appeals
by
the
respondent
dionisio.
mr.
john
powers
crowley
no,
no
your
honor.
mr.
john
powers
crowley
no,
no
your
honor.
that
was
not,
that
--
mr.
john
powers
crowley
that
is
pure
expectation.
mr.
john
powers
crowley
the
point
is
this
that
the
compelling
of
a
witness
before
the
grand
jury
is
the
position
of
this
respondent,
to
give
identifying
characteristics
which
are
normally
not
exposed
to
public
view
is
protected
by
the
fourth
amendment.
mr.
john
powers
crowley
his
voice,
that
is
correct.
mr.
john
powers
crowley
he
has
been
using
them
in
the
grand
jury
but
justice,
he
has
--
mr.
john
powers
crowley
mr.
justice
marshall
--
mr.
john
powers
crowley
just
as
he
is
bringing
his
--
mr.
john
powers
crowley
he
is
bringing
his
fingerprints
into
the
grand
jury
also
but
without
having
placed
the
fingerprints
on
an
inkpad
and
then
transferred
them
to
another
pad
for
the
purposes
of
expert
comparison
that
no
comparison
can
be
made
and
the
same
is
true
with
the
voice
and
as
i
understand
the
procedure
that
to
obtain
voice
exemplars
for
any
comparison
to
be
made
and
whether
--
and
we
don’t
raise
the
question
here
of
the
validity
of
such
experiments.
but
for
the
only,
the
only
way
that
any
comparison
can
be
made
is
if
one
speaks
into
a
specific
type
of
device
which
records
the
vibrations
and
the
tonal
effects
of
the
voice
and
that
they
can
then
be
compared
to
other
unknown
samples.
but
the
mere
talking
before
the
grand
jury
would
not
allow
the
grand
jury
as
i
understand
the
procedure
in
voice
exemplars
to
make
a
comparison
to
a
unknown
sample.
mr.
john
powers
crowley
i
don’t.
that
is
beyond
my
expertise.
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
john
powers
crowley
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
believe
the
statement
of
facts
as
given
by
the
solicitor
is
generally
insufficient.
i
would
like
to
add
one
further
thing
which
i
think
i
had
some
dimension
to
the
problems
here
presented
with.
the
witness,
dionisio,
refused
to
give
voice
exemplars,
a
witness,
charles
bishop
smith
during
the
same
investigation
also
refused
to
give
voice
exemplars.
mr.
smith
after
being
held
in
contempt
and
after
the
seventh
circuit
had
reversed
his
contempt
on
--
in
the
same
opinion
as
here
below.
mr.
smith
was
indicted
by
the
special
february
1971
grand
jury
and
i
believe
it
was,
i
expect,
after
the
governments’
petition
for
certiorari
had
been
filed
in
this
case.
mr.
smith
was
indicted
by
this
grand
jury
for
alleged
violations
of
the
federal
laws
probably
gambling.
mr.
and
the
solicitor
sought
leave
of
court
and
obtained
pursuant
to
rule
60,
the
dismissal
of
the
petition
against
mr.
smith
on
the
grounds
that
his
exemplar,
his
voice
exemplar
was
no
longer
desired
since
he
had
been
indicted.
the
wiretap
evidence,
which
formed
the
basis
for
mr.
smith’s
indictment
and
presumably
formed
the
basis
for
the
request
for
the
grand
jury
exemplars
was
found
by
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
northern
district
of
illinois
in
united
states
versus
smith
et
al
to
have
been
unlawfully
obtained
and
not
properly
authorized.
that
decision,
the
government
has
sought
appeal
from
that
decision.
if
that
decision
is
affirmed
by
the
seventh
circuit,
of
course,
then
mr.
dionisio
would
have
an
additional
reason
for
a
refusal
to
furnish
the
exemplar
under
the
principles
set
forth
in
this
case
and
by
this
court
in
gilbert
versus
united
states.
it
is
the
basis
of
the
respondent’s
argument
--
mr.
john
powers
crowley
it
is
in
the
seventh
circuit
as
of
--
mr.
john
powers
crowley
briefs
are
filed
--
it
is
has
not
been
set
for
argument
it
is
anticipated
mr.
justice
brennan
that
that
case
will
be
argued
in
january,
in
the
january
session
of
the
court.
mr.
john
powers
crowley
yes,
we
would
guess
so.
mr.
john
powers
crowley
i
most
certainly
will.
mr.
charles
bishop
smith
appeared
before
this
grand
jury
with
mr.
dionisio.
mr.
smith
refused
to
give
voice
exemplars.
he
was
held
in
contempt.
his
contempt
was
reversed
by
the
seventh
circuit
in
this
same
opinion.
mr.
john
powers
crowley
subsequent
to
the
filing
of
the
petition
for
certiorari,
mr.
smith
along
with
approximately
18
or
19
others
was
indicted
by
this
special
february
1971
grand
jury.
subsequent
to
that
indictment,
the
solicitor
sought
and
obtained
leave
of
this
court
pursuant
to
rule
60
to
dismiss
the
petition
for
certiorari.
so,
mr.
smith’s
counsel
and
other
counsel
in
the
case
filed
motions
to
suppress
the
wiretap
evidence
which
formed
the
basis
for
mr.
smith’s
indictment
and
formed
the
basis
for
the
grand
jury
inquiry
in
this
case
originally.
the
district
court
granted
those
motions
to
suppress
on
the
basis
that
the
orders
authorizing
the
wiretaps
were
not
lawfully
obtained.
unless
your
honor
wants
me
to,
i
won't
go
into
the
merits
of
that
decision.
i
don’t
think
that’s
properly
before
this
court
but
the
--
mr.
john
powers
crowley
mr.
dionisio
was
never
indicted
by
this
special
grand
jury.
mr.
john
powers
crowley
that
is
correct;
that
is
correct.
mr.
john
powers
crowley
motions
to
suppress.
mr.
john
powers
crowley
by
the
district
court
after
indictment.
mr.
john
powers
crowley
the
government
appealed
that.
mr.
john
powers
crowley
it
is
pending
in
the
seventh
circuit
court
of
appeals
and
it’s
reflected
in
the
--
that
is
reflected
in
my
brief
under
the
statement
on
page
3
that
it’s
pending
in
the
court
of
appeals
--
mr.
john
powers
crowley
no
he
had
--
well,
was
he
was
not
given,
he
--
no,
he
has
not
raised
the
point,
assuming
just
for
the
purposes
of
argument
that
this
court
holds
that
mr.
dionisio
was
not
protected
under
the
fourth
amendment
just
to
give
voice
exemplars
per
se.
i
believe
that
under
this
court’s
opinion
in
gilbert,
that
mr.
dionisio
would
have
a
right
to
refuse
to
give
the
voice
exemplars
alleging
that
the
evidence
upon
which
the
grand
jury
sought
the
exemplars
was
unconstitutionally
obtained.
at
least
what
it
might
constitute
just
cause
for
refusal
to
answer.
mr.
john
powers
crowley
no
your
honor.
if
it
reverses
the
seventh
circuit,
mr.
dionisio
would
then,
i
assume,
be
given
an
opportunity
to
appear
again
in
the
district
court
in
which
he
could
raise
the
issue
that
the
evidence
which
the
grand
jury
sought
to
compare
at
and
sought
to
compare
it
--
compel
the
exemplar
had
been
unconstitutionally
obtained
and
would
appear
to
be
just
cause
for
--
mr.
john
powers
crowley
i
think
it
would
your
honor,
i
would
your
honor
but
i
think
then
mr.
dionisio
would
have
other
collateral
proceedings
available
to
him.
mr.
john
powers
crowley
go
to
the
grand
jury
and
again
refuse
to
give
the
exemplars,
i
think
he
have
to
do
that
on
other
grounds,
on
another
grounds.
mr.
john
powers
crowley
without
binding
--
your
honor
again,
i
--
looking
into
the
future
as
to
what
i
would
do
or
what
his
counsel
at
that
time
would
do,
i
would
assume
that
our
--
a
procedure
similar
to
that
would
have
to
be
followed
in
order
to
protect
his
record,
and
to
comply
with
the
order
of
this
court.
mr.
john
powers
crowley
no
i’m
not,
no
i’m
not
your
honor,
no
i’m
not.
it
is
the
position
of
the
respondent
here
that
the
decision
of
the
seventh
circuit
does
not
as
contended
by
the
government
present
a
novel
issue.
it
has
been
law,
in
hale
versus
henkel
that
the
fourth
amendment
applies
to
grand
jury
proceeding.
in
hale
versus
henkel
this
court
held
or
struck
a
subpoena
requirement
production
of
documentary
evidence
before
a
grand
jury
as
the
overbroad
in
violation
of
the
fourth
amendment.
it
is
also
interesting
to
know
that
this
court’s
decision
in
hale
versus
henkel
as
did
the
decision
of
the
seventh
circuit
below,
this
court
indicated
in
hale
versus
henkel
that
it
might
very
well
appear
at
some
future
time
in
the
grand
jury
proceeding
that
the
request
for
this
overbroad
production
of
documentary
evidence
might
very
well
be
a
reasonable
request
and
therefore
reasonable
within
the
meaning
of
the
fourth
amendment
and
that
the
person
then
could
be
compelled
to
produce
the
papers.
what
the
government
would
ask
this
court
to
hold
is
that
the
fourth
amendment’s
application
to
grand
jury
proceeding
applies
solely
to
the
production
of
documentary
evidence.
we
submit
that
to
place
this
limitation
upon
the
fourth
amendment
is
to
give
an
unduly
restrictive
meaning
to
the
fourth
amendment.
what
the
government
--
if
their
position
is
sustained
here,
what
they
would
then
allow
the
grand
jury
to
do
would
be
to
do
under
the
ages
of
a
simple
grand
jury
subpoena
to
violate
the
fourth
amendment
where
normal
investigative
procedures
of
law
enforcement
at
agencies
could
not
do.
mr.
john
powers
crowley
mr.
chief
justice
they
have
in
the
sense
of
their
--
the
broadness
of
the
scope
of
the
investigation,
the
admissibility
before
the
grand
jury
of
hearsay
evidences
carried
by
this
court
in
costello
and
many
other
cases
that
the
grand
jury
may
--
its
investigation
may
take
many,
many
different
channels
and
go
in
many,
many
different
areas,
but
still
the
grand
jury
must
--
the
grand
jury
in
its
investigation
cannot,
because
it
wishes
to
investigate,
cannot
violate
the
privileges
under
the
fourth
amendment.
if
--
mr.
john
powers
crowley
i
think
--
mr.
john
powers
crowley
mr.
chief
justice,
i
think
it
is
a
distinction
without
a
difference.
yes,
in
davis
--
mr.
john
powers
crowley
but
i
think
in
this
case
--
if
this
court
--
if
we
take
that
analogy
then
all
that
would
have
been
required
in
davis
to
legalize
the
grand
jury
are
or
the
fingerprint.
if
the
situation
had
been
reversed
rather
than
the
dragnet
detention
in
davis
where
the
police
went
up
and
took
into
custody
many,
many
young
blacks
in
the
community.
if
they
did
--
instead
of
doing
that
caused
subpoenas
to
--
grand
jury
subpoenas
to
be
served
on
every
young
black
in
the
community,
call
him
before
the
grand
jury
and
forced
him
to
give
his
fingerprints
before
the
grand
jury,
i
submit
that
the
invidious
nature
would
still
be
present.
and
that
the
grand
jury
would
be
violating
the
individual
fourth
amendment
rights
just
as
much
as
the
unlawful
police
detention
in
which
the
fingerprinting
was
a
product
of
that
unlawful
detention
because
it
is
true
that
the
grand
jury
can
issue
a
subpoena
to
compel
the
appearance
of
anyone
before
it.
however,
the
grand
jury
cannot
issue
a
subpoena
to
compel
the
production
of
things
before
it
without
regard
to
the
fourth
amendment.
and
i
think
by
analogy,
proposed
rule
41,
new
federal
rules
of
criminal
procedure
provides
that
applications
can
be
made
to
magistrates
to
compel
individuals
to
submit
to
identification
procedures
such
as
suggested
here,
such
as
voiceprints,
fingerprints,
etcetera.
however,
in
applying
to
a
magistrate
for
such
an
order,
the
agency
or
the
government
applying
to
the
magistrate
must
submit
papers
to
show
probable
cause
and
reasonable
grounds
before
the
magistrate
will
issue
such
an
order.
now,
grand
juries,
i
think
are
subject
generally
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
district
courts
and
to
say
that
the
grand
jury
then
would
have
greater
subpoena
power
than
the
district
court,
i
think
is
to
ignore
the
function
of
the
grand
jury
we
can
compel
for
example
the
attendance
of
witnesses
before
any
district
court
in
the
united
states
by
proper
service
of
the
subpoena.
but
we
could
not
compel
that
person
in
a
--
to
compel
him
to
appear
before
the
district
court
in
a
case
on
trial,
and
i
don’t
think
then
could
compel
him
to
give
voice
identification,
handwriting
exemplars
or
whatever
other
physical
characteristic
be
required.
i
think
that
--
yes.
mr.
john
powers
crowley
no,
it
is
not
probable
cause
but
it
must
be
questions
that
are
relevant
in
material
to
the
inquiry
and
there
must
be
some
showing
of
relevancy
in
materiality
to
the
issues
at
trial
before
the
court
will
allow
counsel
to
question
into
an
area
that
does
not
have
immediate
appearance
of
relevance.
mr.
john
powers
crowley
i
think
there
your
honor
we
are
seeking
solely
to
testimony
and
absent
a
fifth
amendment
question.
i
don’t
think
we
have
the
same
principles
we
have
involved
here.
mr.
john
powers
crowley
i
think
there
is
a
substantial
difference.
mr.
john
powers
crowley
yes
it
is.
mr.
john
powers
crowley
then,
there
is
another
problem
that
maybe
presented,
there
may
be
a
violation
of
the
fourth
amendment
if
the
grand
jury,
if
it
can
be
established,
i
think
that
we
have
here,
that
there
was
no
reasonable
grounds
to
bring
this
man
before
the
grand
jury
and
he
was
only
called
before
the
grand
jury
not
asked
any
substantive
questions
in
the
regard
to
their
investigation
but
merely
as
a
(voice
overlap)
to
obtain
--
mr.
john
powers
crowley
not
the
--
not
eliminate,
no
you
do
not.
once
a
grand
jury
subpoena
calling
for
the
attendance
of
a
person
before
the
grand
jury
which
is
all
the
subpoena
is
called
for.
the
government
speaks
in
terms
of
that
these
subpoenas
were
narrowly
drawn
when
calling
for
--
mr.
john
powers
crowley
i’m
sorry
mr.
justice.
mr.
john
powers
crowley
i
do
not
believe,
you
do
know.
mr.
john
powers
crowley
i
do
not
believe
that
we
would
be
faced
here
with
the
voiceprint
type
of
identification
because
my
understanding
of
the
voiceprint
that
this
would
--
taking
your
voice
down
on
tape
would
not
give
the
necessary
fidelity
that
would
allow
comparison
to
the
other
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
john
powers
crowley
i
think
the
complaint
would
be
similar
to
the
complaint
here
that
if
the
witness
--
mr.
john
powers
crowley
yes,
move
the
sub
--
no
i
couldn’t
--
i
couldn’t
do
anything
then
your
honor
but
if
i
were
subsequently
indicted
and
this
evidence
that
i
gave
before
the
grand
jury
was
sought
to
be
used
against
me
for
the
purposes
of
that
identification
rather
than
used
against
me
as
is
common
for
the
--
mr.
john
powers
crowley
i
don’t
think
i
could
move
to
quash
the
indictment
your
honor.
i
think
i
could
move
to
suppress
the
evidence
that
has
been
obtained.
mr.
john
powers
crowley
no
your
honor,
it
is
not.
mr.
john
powers
crowley
there
is
not.
we
have
a
completely
different
situation
here.
this
man
is
being
compelled
under
threat
of
imprisonment
to
give
voice
exemplars.
in
the
other
case
he
is
not
being
compelled
under
threat
of
imprisonment,
he
had
been
--
he
just
ordered
before
the
grand
jury,
answered
questions.
if
he
were
to
answer,
just
be
called
before
--
mr.
john
powers
crowley
in
this
--
in
your
case,
he
could
take
the
fifth
amendment
and
i
don’t
think
there
would
be
a
--
i
think
it’ll
be
a
perfectly
valid
claim
of
the
fifth
amendment.
mr.
john
powers
crowley
in
this
case
he
would
not
and
you’re
hypothetically
correct.
mr.
john
powers
crowley
well,
your
honor
i
think
under
the
fourth
amendment
that
the
physical
identifying
characteristics
such
as
in
schmerber
versus
california
recognized
that
the
taking
of
the
blood
sample
was
protected
under
the
fourth
amendment.
if
we
take
dionisio,
and
dionisio
and
20
others
are
compelled
before
to
appear
before
the
grand
jury
--
properly
compelled
to
appear
before
the
grand
jury
and
then
compelled
under
threat
of
contempt
to
furnish
blood,
we
have
the
schmerber
case
before
it.
they
could
similarly
be
called
under
the
government’s
theory
that
the
government
has
prevailed
in
this
case,
dragnet
subpoenas
could
constantly
be
used
to
investigate,
to
bring
people
before
the
grand
jury
to
compel
him
to
give
blood,
to
compel
him
to
give
hair
samples,
to
compel
him
to
give
semen,
compel
him
to
give
voiceprints,
the
handwriting
as
the
case
in
mara.
and
what
you
are
then
authorizing
the
grand
jury
to
do
is
allow
the
government
through
the
vehicle
of
the
grand
jury
and
in
violation
of
rule
41
of
the
federal
rules
of
criminal
procedure
just
to
bypass
the
magistrate
and
not
ask
the
magistrate
for
the
order
because
there
they
must
show
a
probable
cause
and
it
is
recognized
under
the
rule
that
that
probable
cause
for
that
type
of
compulsive
testimonial
identification
must
be
--
must
--
that
the
compulsion
for
testimonial
identification
must
be
supported
by
probable
cause.
but
then
to
allow
the
grand
jury
to
turn
around
and
do
the
exactly
the
same
thing,
we
submit
is
just
as
much
protected
by
the
fourth
amendment
as
it
would
be
protected
in
an
application
to
a
magistrate.
we
submit
that
these
--
for
example,
the
voice
exemplar
or
the
person’s
voice
as
is
his
handwriting
which
would
be
covered
of
course
by
counsel
for
the
respondent
mara,
are
not
those
types
of
physical
characteristics
which
are
necessarily
exposed
to
plain
view,
such
as
a
person’s
stature
or
his
facial
characteristic.
a
person
can
choose
to
speak
or
not
to
speak
and
to
do
that
requires
a
conscious
act
of
will,
something
that
he
possesses
within
himself
and
requires
his
act
of
will
to
expose
to
the
general
public
whereas
his
facial
characteristics
are
exposed
to
the
general
public
and
to
everyone
concerned
without
any
active
will
on
his
part
unless
he
would
have
become
a
permit.
mr.
john
powers
crowley
yes,
mr.
justice.
mr.
john
powers
crowley
i
think
that’d
be
the
physical
characteristics
as
just
as
his
face.
mr.
john
powers
crowley
it
would
react
in
--
well,
that
would
be
such
as
the
person
putting
on
a
coat
to
see
if
a
coat
fits
it
which
has
been
approved
by
this
court
but
i
think
your
honor
that
they
go
to
things
such
as
that
go
to
a
--
to
a
mere
physical
characteristics
of
a
person.
for
example
--
mr.
john
powers
crowley
this
--
possibly
be
done,
yes.
because
if
a
--
within
a
reasonable
limitations
of
decency,
i
would
suppose
yes.
mr.
john
powers
crowley
right.
but
to
[laughter]
just
i
think
that
if
a
man
for
example
refute,
when
i
talk
about
the
act
of
will,
if
a
man
refused
there
to
exhibit
his
arms
to
see
if
there
were
a
tattoo,
his
coat
or
his
shirt
could
be
removed
from
him
by
someone
else.
he
could
not
by
his
own
act
completely
hide
from
anyone
else
what
appeared,
the
tattoo
on
his
arm
because
others
could
take
his
coat
off
and
the
tattoo
would
then
become
visible.
but
no
act
of
anyone
else
could
force
a
man
to
speak.
and
i
think
that
there
is
a
valid
distinction
there.
mr.
john
powers
crowley
yes,
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
mr.
john
powers
crowley
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
i
--
but
it's
certainly
an
area
beyond
my
expertise
but
it
is
my
understanding
just
generally
that
the
speaking,
there
is
a
speaking
of
with
the
release
of
all
inhibitions
and
to
speak
what
is
in
the
subconscious,
to
answer
questions
that
are
in
this
--
that
the
answers
to
which
are
in
the
subconscious
and
that
the
man
in
answering
the
question
will
not
color
his
answer
and
theoretically
will
speak
the
truth
to
the
question
put.
i
don’t
know
if
those
drugs
administer
--
i
just
don’t
know
if
those
drugs
administered
to
a
person
overcome
his
entire
will
so
that
he
speaks
against
his
will.
i
don’t
believe
they
do.
i
believe
that
the
answer
may
not
have
the
inhibitions
given
by
the
conscious
mind
but
i
--
and
be
free
of
that
--
of
those
--
of
that
conscious
mind
and
be
dictated
solely
by
the
subconscious.
but
i
don’t
think
that
the
administration
of
the
drugs
themselves,
a
fortiori
just
brings
forth
a
vocal
response.
and
i
think
that
in
--
if
we
were
to
take
that
position,
if
persons
were
dragnet
and
i
think
here
the
evidence
shows
that
there
was
a
dragnet
similar
to
that
in
davis
that
20
people
were
called
before
the
grand
jury
and
that
absolutely
no
showing
whatsoever
as
to
the
reasonableness
of
their
being
called
before
the
grand
jury
but
i
don’t
think
the
grand
jury
has
to
show
that
but
the
reasonableness
of
the
grand
jury’s
asking
for
their
voice
exemplars.
mr.
john
powers
crowley
no
i
don’t,
no
i
don't
your
honor
that
that
--
mr.
john
powers
crowley
i
think
the
record
here
is
this
as
the
solicitor
points
out
would
indicate
that
the
witness
when
he
appeared
before
the
grand
jury
refused
to
testify
in
the
grand
jury
and
at
in
--
he
was
never
requested
to
give
the
exemplars
in
front
of
the
grand
jury
per
se.
but
i
think
that
there
the
solicitor’s
interpretation
of
the
record
here
is
reasonably
correct.
and
we
did
not
raise
that
issue
below.
the
seventh
circuit
mentioned
it
in
a
footnote
primarily
in
relation
to
the
authority
of
the
grand
juries
to
appoint
agents
to
hear
a
testimony
but
that
is
not
raised
in
the
district
court.
it
was
not
raised
in
the
court
of
appeals
by
the
respondent
dionisio.
mr.
john
powers
crowley
no,
no
your
honor.
mr.
john
powers
crowley
no,
no
your
honor.
that
was
not,
that
--
mr.
john
powers
crowley
that
is
pure
expectation.
mr.
john
powers
crowley
the
point
is
this
that
the
compelling
of
a
witness
before
the
grand
jury
is
the
position
of
this
respondent,
to
give
identifying
characteristics
which
are
normally
not
exposed
to
public
view
is
protected
by
the
fourth
amendment.
mr.
john
powers
crowley
his
voice,
that
is
correct.
mr.
john
powers
crowley
he
has
been
using
them
in
the
grand
jury
but
justice,
he
has
--
mr.
john
powers
crowley
mr.
justice
marshall
--
mr.
john
powers
crowley
just
as
he
is
bringing
his
--
mr.
john
powers
crowley
he
is
bringing
his
fingerprints
into
the
grand
jury
also
but
without
having
placed
the
fingerprints
on
an
inkpad
and
then
transferred
them
to
another
pad
for
the
purposes
of
expert
comparison
that
no
comparison
can
be
made
and
the
same
is
true
with
the
voice
and
as
i
understand
the
procedure
that
to
obtain
voice
exemplars
for
any
comparison
to
be
made
and
whether
--
and
we
don’t
raise
the
question
here
of
the
validity
of
such
experiments.
but
for
the
only,
the
only
way
that
any
comparison
can
be
made
is
if
one
speaks
into
a
specific
type
of
device
which
records
the
vibrations
and
the
tonal
effects
of
the
voice
and
that
they
can
then
be
compared
to
other
unknown
samples.
but
the
mere
talking
before
the
grand
jury
would
not
allow
the
grand
jury
as
i
understand
the
procedure
in
voice
exemplars
to
make
a
comparison
to
a
unknown
sample.
mr.
john
powers
crowley
i
don’t.
that
is
beyond
my
expertise.
thank
you
very
much.
