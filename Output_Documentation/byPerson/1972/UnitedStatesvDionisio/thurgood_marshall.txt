justice
thurgood
marshall
but
this
is
not
a
testimony,
is
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
i
thought
you
said
that
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
thought
you
said
this
was
done
out
--
was
to
be
done
outside
of
the
grand
jury
room
by
an
agent
of
the
grand
jury.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
is
that
a
testimony?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
i
thought
all
these
provisions
you're
talking
about
that
have
never
disputed
and
all,
that’s
testimony
before
a
grand
jury,
isn’t
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
good!
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
would
this
man
be
ever
refused
to
testify
in
the
grand
jury
room
pursuant
to
subpoena
by
the
grand
jury?
justice
thurgood
marshall
now,
this
is
not
the
--
i
think
you
understand
what
i’m
talking
about,
did
he
ever
refuse
to
testify
before
the
grand
jury
pursuant
to
a
grand
jury
subpoena?
justice
thurgood
marshall
do
you
think
an
exemplar
is
testimony?
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
it
or
is
it
not?
justice
thurgood
marshall
in
the
presence
of
the
grand
jury?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
what
did
he
refuse
to
do
in
the
presence
of
the
grand
jury?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
did
this
man
refuse
to
do?
justice
thurgood
marshall
in
the
presence
of
a
grand
jury?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
what
did
the
grand
jury
--
how
did
this
come
up?
did
the
grand
jury
called
him
in
and
say,
“we
want
you
to
testify.”
justice
thurgood
marshall
suppose
the
grand
jury
said,
“mr.
dionisio,
whatever
your
name
is,
we
order
you
to
go
into
the
other
room
and
give
a
statement
to
an
fbi
agent.”
would
that
come
under
the
same
rule?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what’s
the
difference
between
that
and
this?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
would
you
still
--
we
keep
you
saying,
“in
the
grand
jury
room.”
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
did
he
--
did
he,
at
any
time,
refuse
to
make
these
statements
in
the
grand
jury
room?
justice
thurgood
marshall
was
that
in
the
grand
jury
room?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
then
he
never
refused
to
testify
in
the
grand
jury
room?
justice
thurgood
marshall
did
he
ever
refuse
to
make
--
to
read
these
figures
and
numbers
and
horses’
names
in
the
grand
jury
room?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
what
--
he
didn’t
refuse
to
answer
any
questions
in
the
grand
jury
room,
did
he?
justice
thurgood
marshall
did
he
refuse
any
questions?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
the
occurrence
of
19
witnesses
doesn’t
affect
this
case
at
all?
justice
thurgood
marshall
who
was
the
agent?
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
it’s
like
--
my
hypothetical,
you'd
go
down
the
hall,
and
talk
to
an
fbi
agent.
justice
thurgood
marshall
what's
the
difference?
justice
thurgood
marshall
where
is
that
in
the
appendix?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well
assuming
that
the
testimony
before
the
grand
jury
is
taken
down
on
tape
and
then
tested
what
would
you
do
then?
justice
thurgood
marshall
or
do
you
have
a
right
to
challenge
--
do
you
have
a
right
challenge
the
reason
a
person
is
brought
before
the
grand
jury?
justice
thurgood
marshall
my
question
for
--
very
simple,
which
i
like
an
answer
to
it.
justice
thurgood
marshall
your
subpoena
before
a
grand
jury,
do
you
have
any
redress
other
than
to
appear?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
when
you
appear,
they
ask
you
your
name
and
address
and
that
is
taken
down
on
tape
and
examined,
what
is
your
complaint?
justice
thurgood
marshall
my
assumption
was
it
could
be
done.
what
would
your
complaint
be?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you'd
moved
to
strike
the
grand
jury
admitting
to
something?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
could
you
move
to
quash
the
indictment?
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
the
only
difference
between
this
case
and
the
hypothetical
is
that
they
asked
him
to
go
outside
and
do
it.
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
is
the
other
difference?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
in
my
case,
if
he
didn’t
answer
the
question,
what
would
happen
to
him?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
if
you
had
anything,
if
he
didn’t
answer
the
question
he
goes
to
jail.
justice
thurgood
marshall
that’s
right.
so
i
can’t
see
the
difference
you’ve
--
i
just
don’t
see
the
fourth
amendment
part
here.
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
your
whole
point
is
if
you
talked
to
the
grand
jury,
you’ll
say
anything
and
answer
any
question
but
you’ll
not
give
an
exemplar?
justice
thurgood
marshall
before
the
grand
jury?
is
that
your
point?
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
what
is
your
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
then
you
please
tell
me
what
your
point
is?
justice
thurgood
marshall
exemplify
and
character
is
his
talking?
justice
thurgood
marshall
his
voice
which
he
has
been
using
in
the
grand
jury.
justice
thurgood
marshall
he
has
been
using
it
in
the
grand
jury.
but
he
cannot
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
he
does
not
allow
the
grand
jury
to
make
an
exemplar
out
of
it.
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
that
your
point?
justice
thurgood
marshall
(inaudible).
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
that
can
be
done
in
the
grand
jury
room?
justice
thurgood
marshall
or
outside
the
grand
jury
room
depending
on
whether
or
not
the
witness
wants
a
lawyer
present.
justice
thurgood

but
this
is
