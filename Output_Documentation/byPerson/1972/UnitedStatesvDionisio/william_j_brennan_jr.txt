the
in
the
seventh

now?
justice
william
j.
brennan,

has
it
been

justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
is
mr.
dionisio
one
of
those
who
made
that
motion?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
oh
no!
oh,
i
see.
so
only
those
who
had
been
indicted
made
this
motion,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
so
far,
i
gather,
mr.
dionisio
has
never
raised
this
point?
justice
william
j.
brennan,

if
this
court
sustains
his
contempt
conviction,
how
does
he
do
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
if
this
court
reverses
to
seventh
circuit,
will
that
not
reinstate
the
judgment,
the
contempt
conviction?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
