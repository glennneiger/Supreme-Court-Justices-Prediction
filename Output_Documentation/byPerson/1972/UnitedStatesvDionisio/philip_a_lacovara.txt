mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case,
united
states
against
dionisio
and
the
next
case
on
the
court's
calendar
this
morning,
united
states
against
mara,
both
raised
important
questions
about
the
ability
of
federal
grand
juries
to
obtain
exemplar
evidence
from
recalcitrant
witnesses.
both
cases
are
here
on
writs
of
certiorari
applied
for
by
the
united
states
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit.
in
this
case,
the
proceedings
began
when
a
special
federal
grand
jury
sitting
in
the
northern
district
of
illinois,
the
special
february
1971
grand
jury,
subpoenaed
mr.
dionisio
and
approximately
20
others
in
a
gambling
investigation
that
the
special
grand
jury
was
conducting.
mr.
dionisio
and
others
were
ordered
by
the
grand
jury
foreman
to
give
voice
exemplars
and
this
was
explained
to
them
to
be
the
reading
of
a
transcript
over
a
telephone
connected
to
a
recording
device.
mr.
dionisio
refused
to
give
the
exemplars
as
directed
by
the
grand
jury
foreman
and
as
did
other
grand
jury
witnesses
and
the
government,
thereafter
filed
petitions
to
obtain
court
orders
to
compel
the
furnishing
of
the
voice
exemplars.
the
government’s
petition
against
mr.
dionisio
alleged
that
the
special
grand
jury
was
investigating
violations
of
federal
criminal
statutes
that
the
grand
jury
thought
it
necessary
and
essential
to
obtain
a
voice
exemplar
of
mr.
dionisio’s
voice
on
the
telephone
for
the
sole
purpose
of
comparing
his
voice
as
recorded
with
voices
intercepted
pursuant
to
court
orders
issued
by
the
federal
district
court.
the
government
also
alleged
that
the
transcript
that
mr.
dionisio
had
been
asked
to
read
was
special
grand
jury
exhibit
13,
which
the
petition
stated
consisted
of
names,
numbers
and
races,
names
of
horses,
numbers
of
horses
and
races
and
certain
other
information.
a
hearing
on
petition
in
this
matter,
as
well
as
the
petitions
with
respect
to
the
other
20
or
so
recalcitrant
witnesses
was
held
before
chief
judge
robson
of
the
district
court.
and
at
that
hearing,
it
was
brought
out
that
what
the
government
was
seeking
was
compliance
with
what
was
termed
a
reasonable
order
of
the
grand
jury.
and
this
was
explained
to
mean
that
if
an
exemplar
that
was
clear
was
given
only
one
exemplar
would
be
necessary
that
on
the
basis
of
similar
requests,
several
days
earlier,
exemplars
had
been
given
by
other
witnesses
and
the
time
consumed
had
been
no
more
than
10
or
20
minutes.
that
the
government
would
preserve
any
and
all
original
exemplars
for
subsequent
comparison
and
expert
analysis
including
by
the
defense
and
that
counsel
could
be
present
during
the
taking
of
the
exemplars,
because
the
expected
procedure
would
be
that
the
exemplar
would
be
given
before
a
specially
designated
agent
of
the
grand
jury
outside
the
grand
jury
room.
chief
judge
robson
entered
orders
directing
each
of
the
witnesses
including
mr.
dionisio
to
provide
the
exemplars.
19
of
the
21
witnesses
did
provide
the
exemplars
under
court
order.
mr.
dionisio
and
one
other
witness
whose
petition
was
ultimately
dismissed
by
the
government
refused
to
give
the
exemplars
asserting
fourth
and
fifth
amendment
defenses.
the
court
entered
an
opinion,
which
is
reprinted
in
the
appendix
to
our
certiorari
petition
in
which
both
the
fourth
amendment
and
fifth
amendment
claims
were
rejected.
on
the
fourth
amendment
issue,
chief
judge
robson
held
that
since
the
grand
jury
subpoenas
were
lawful,
the
witnesses
were
properly
subject
to
these
directions,
were
not
in
unlawful
detention
within
the
meaning
of
this
court’s
decision
in
davis
against
mississippi
and
relying
on
this
court's
decisions
in
gilbert,
wade
and
other
cases
held
that
no
fifth
amendment
values
are
impinged
upon
by
requiring
a
person
to
give
exemplars.
when
mr.
dionisio
refused
an
open
court
to
give
the
exemplars,
he
was
committed
for
contempt
until
he
complied
with
the
order
or
until
the
expiration
of
18
months
which
is
the
maximum
statutory
imprisonment
for
civil
contempt.
on
appeal,
after
mr.
dionisio
had
been
released
on
bond
by
the
seventh
circuit,
the
court
of
appeals
rejected
fifth
amendment
claims,
as
well
as
any
possible
sixth
amendment
claim,
but
found
that
the
fourth
amendment
defense
was
a
valid
one.
the
court
ruled
that
before
a
grand
jury
may
compel
a
witness
before
it
to
give
exemplars
of
his
voice,
the
government
must
make
an
affirmative
factual
showing
that
this
request
is
reasonable.
the
court
apparently
believed
that
the
petition
and
the
hearing
that
were
--
was
held
on
the
government’s
petition
did
not
satisfy
that
reasonable
--
reasonableness
of
request
and
the
court
reversed
the
contempt
judgment.
the
ground
for
decision
by
the
seventh
circuit
was
essentially
that
exemplars
maybe
covered
by
the
fourth
amendment
relying
here
on
the
same
case
that
the
district
court
had
found
not
applicable,
davis
against
mississippi.
and
also
that
the
fourth
amendment
applies
to
grand
jury
proceedings
and
the
court
relied
on
one
or
two
decisions
of
this
court
in
which
the
court
stated
that
grand
jury
subpoenas
for
the
production
of
documents
might
be
so
broad
and
ill-defined
as
to
constitute
an
unreasonable
search.
the
government
petition
for
rehearing
en
banc
that
was
denied
by
a
5:3
vote
and
in
august
of
1971
we
filed
the
petition
for
certiorari.
in
may
of
1972,
after
we
filed
a
supplemental
memorandum
calling
to
the
court’s
attention
in
intervening
decision
by
chief
judge
friendly
of
the
second
circuit,
which
had
explicitly
rejected
the
rationale
of
the
dionisio
case,
court
granted
certiorari.
the
issue
then
in
this
first
case
is
whether,
when
a
grand
jury
witness
has
been
properly
called
before
an
investigating
grand
jury,
the
fourth
amendment
requires
that
before
a
witness
can
be
compelled
to
give
exemplars
of
his
voice,
or
as
in
mara
exemplars
of
his
handwriting,
the
government
must
make
an
affirmative
factual
showing
that
this
request
is
reasonable.
it’s
the
government’s
petition
--
position
that
no
such
requirement
of
affirmative
factual
showing
of
reasonableness
is
necessary
under
the
fourth
amendment
and
that
the
decision
below
constitutes
a
departure
from
settled
principles
of
grand
jury
practice
and
settled
principles
of
the
application
of
the
fourth
amendment.
we
think
the
appropriate
place
to
start
in
this
case,
as
chief
judge
friendly
in
the
schwartz
case
has
done,
is
with
the
nature
of
the
grand
jury
itself.
there
is
no
need,
i
think,
for
us
to
rehearse
at
any
great
length
the
principles
governing
grand
jury
investigations,
since
only
last
term
the
court
had
a
number
of
such
cases
before
it.
but
briefly
the
relevant
context
here
is
this.
a
grand
jury
is
the
touchstone
of
the
criminal
process
under
the
federal
system
since
only
a
grand
jury
can
initiate
felony
prosecutions.
the
grand
jury
for
several
hundred
years
has
had
the
undisputed
right
to
compulsory
process.
this
court
has
explained
that
compulsory
process
involves
not
only
the
justifiable
demand
that
every
witness
appear
before
the
grand
jury,
but
that
every
witness
unless
his
testimony
is
privileged
must
testify
before
the
grand
jury
in
its
search
for
truth.
the
last
term
in
a
decision
which
has
been
rendered
by
this
court
since
the
seventh
circuit’s
decision
in
the
two
cases
before
the
court
this
morning,
the
court
rejected
the
very
kind
of
preliminary
showing
that
the
seventh
circuit
has
imposed
in
these
cases
in
branzburg,
caldwell,
and
pappas,
will
be
recalled
where
important
first
amendment
rights
were
unquestionably
involved
as
none
of
the
justices
of
the
court
disputed.
the
court
nevertheless
said
that
in
light
of
the
historic
function
of
the
grand
jury
even
where
it
was
possible
that
there
might
be
some
collateral
impact
on
first
amendment
values.
nevertheless,
a
newsman
subpoenaed
before
a
grand
jury
had
an
obligation
to
appear
and
had
an
obligation
to
testify
and
in
rendering
that
decision
the
court
explicitly
rejected
the
suggestion
that
even
in
order
to
protect
these
first
amendment
rights
some
preliminary
showing
should
be
made
before
the
newsman
was
compelled
to
respond
to
the
subpoena.
the
showing
that
was
suggested
by
the
lower
courts
by
the
dissent
in
branzburg
was
remarkably
similar
to
the
showing
of
reasonableness
that
the
seventh
circuit
has
imposed
in
these
cases.
and
it’s
our
position
that
a
showing,
in
this
context,
is
no
more
justified
than
in
the
branzburg,
caldwell,
and
pappas
context.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
yes
sir.
the
second
case
this
morning
involves
the
follow
up
decision
by
the
seventh
circuit
of
the
--
nature
of
the
proceeding
that
must
be
held
to
demonstrate
reasonableness
and
the
substantive
content
of
the
reasonableness.
but
if
this
court
decides
that
the
seventh
circuit
erred
in
dionisio
in
saying
that
there
is
this
kind
of
constitutional
requirement,
the
second
case,
in
our
judgment,
becomes
academic.
the
contention
by
the
seventh
circuit
which
is,
of
course,
defended
by
the
respondents
in
these
cases
is
that
compelling
a
witness
to
provide
this
kind
of
exemplar
evidence
is
covered
by
the
fourth
amendment,
even
though,
as
the
seventh
circuit
itself
is
conceded,
the
fourth
amendment,
governing
unreasonable
seizures
of
persons,
does
not
apply
to
summoning
a
witness
before
a
grand
jury.
it
has
never
been
held
and
no
court
that
i
am
aware
of
has
ever
suggested
that
a
general
--
as
a
general
principle,
the
government
or
the
grand
jury
must
make
a
preliminary
showing
of
reasonableness
before
a
witness
can
be
compelled
to
appear
and
testify
before
a
grand
jury.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
well
it
is.
it’s
the
giving
of
evidence.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
it’s
not
testimonial
--
pardon
me.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
that
was
the
procedure
that
was
contemplated.
the
order,
the
petition
--
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
yes
sir.
if
this
is
the
giving
of
evidence
before
the
grand
jury
--
that’s
a
grand
jury’s
direction.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
well,
i
can
answer
that
question
--
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
--
by
saying
that
the
petition
that
the
government
filed
and
the
order
that
was
entered
in
both
of
these
cases
did
not
require
that
the
evidence
and
the
testimony,
if
you
will,
be
given
outside
the
grand
jury
room.
this
was
the
procedure
that
the
government
proposed
so
that
counsel
could
be
present
during
the
taking
of
the
exemplars.
this
was
thought
to
be
a
benefit
before
the
witness.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
he
was
asked
that
he
would
give
exemplars,
and
he
refused
on
fourth
and
fifth
amendment
grounds.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
my
answer
to
that
question
and
i
don’t
think
it’s
evasive,
it’s
that
yes.
what
he
was
ordered
to
do
by
the
district
court,
and
that’s
what’s
on
challenge
here,
was
to
provide
exemplars
as
it
deemed
necessary
by
the
grand
jury
either
before
and
to
the
grand
jury
--
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
well,
it’s
testimony
in
the
sense
that
--
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
well,
i
can’t
answer
yes
or
no
and
be
fair
to
the
court.
it’s
testimony
in
the
sense
that
it’s
--
what
he
is
--
it
is
evidence
that
he
is
obliged
to
give
in
the
presence
of
the
grand
jury
pursuant
to
the
grand
jury
subpoena.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
yes.
if
--
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
he
can
refuse
--
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
he
refused
to
give
an
exemplar.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
yes
sir.
the
order
that’s
been
entered
states
--
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
the
grand
jury
called
him,
explained
that
he
was
a
potential
defendant
and
that
he
had
fifth
and
sixth
amendment
rights,
and
asked
him
whether
he
would
give
a
voice
exemplar
if
ordered
to
give
one.
it
was
explained
to
him
and
i
understand
the
thrust
of
your
question
that
the
procedure
that
was
contemplated
was
that
the
telephone
into
which
he
was
being
directed
to
speak
was
in
another
office
on
that
same
floor.
he
did
not
object
on
that
ground
in
the
district
court,
i
must
say,
either
before
the
grand
jury
or
in
court
and
i
think
the
order
that
has
been
entered
against
him
on
the
government’s
petition
would
be
satisfied
if
mr.
dionisio
had
said,
“i
will
give
this
testimony
in
the
grand
jury
room
but
not
outside.”
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
well,
there
we
have
a
fifth
amendment
problem.
we’re
talking
here
--
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
well,
we’re
talking
here
about
evidence
which
i
believe
the
grand
jury
was
entitled
lawfully
to
compel
mr.
dionisio
to
give
in
the
grand
jury
room
and
the
fact
that
--
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
the
alternative
procedure
that
was
set
up
here
was
not
a
condition,
on
the
government’s
part,
it
made
no
difference.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
he
was
asked
to
refer
--
to
the
grand
jury
testimony,
he
was
asked
whether
he
would
give
voice
exemplars,
and
he
said,
“no”
and
he
claimed
the
fourth
and
fifth
amendment
--
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
after
he
was
told
what
the
procedure
was,
he
was
asked
whether
he
could
give
exemplars.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
no
sir,
no,
because
at
the
hearing
--
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
yes
sir.
i
think
the
reading
of
the
transcript
of
the
hearing
before
chief
judge
robson,
will
show
that
the
orders
that
were
being
entered,
were
to
direct
the
witnesses
to
give
these
exemplars
and
at
that
time
they
were
being
entered
and
argued
on
the
merits,
it
was
not
clear
to
judge
robson
that
the
procedure
that
was
expected
for
purposes
of
defense
counsel
being
in
attendant
was
to
have
them
given
in
before
specially
designated
agent
of
the
grand
jury
outside
the
grand
jury
room.
but
what
judge
robson
asked
the
counsel
and
the
respondent
in
each
of
these
cases
was,
“will
you
give
the
exemplars?”
it
was
not,
“will
you
give
them
outside
the
grand
jury
room?”
and
as
i
say,
the
order
that
was
entered
was
not
limited
to
giving
them
outside
the
grand
jury
room
and
there
would
have
been
no
contempt
here.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
well,
he
refused,
while
in
the
grand
jury
room,
to
give
exemplars.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
no,
the
only
evidence
that
he
was
asked
to
give
in
the
grand
jury
room
by
the
grand
jury
was
the
exemplars.
on
this
point,
i
reiterate
that
the
order
that
was
entered
by
chief
judge
robson
and
the
order
that
was
asked
for
by
the
government
provide
it
with
a
giving
of
exemplars
either
before
and
to
the
grand
jury
or
to
a
specially
designated
agent
of
the
grand
jury
who
had
been
sworn
by
the
grand
jury
previously
to
receive
this
evidence
so
that,
as
i
say,
there
was
also
no
objection
on
the
ground
that
this
was
beyond
the
power
of
the
grand
jury
to
do.
and
we
suggest
the
case
of
bryan
against
the
united
states
in
339
u.s.
is
dispositive
of
this
point,
since
this
objection
was
not
made
by
the
witnesses,
it
was
not
the
basis
for
his
objection
and
if
that
objection
had
been
made,
the
government
of
course
would
have
been
quite
willing
to
receive
the
exemplars
in
the
grand
jury
room.
but
as
the
transcript
of
the
hearing
makes
it
clear,
mr.
justice
marshall,
the
government
counsel
said
that
the
procedure
that
was
contemplated
was
outside
the
grand
jury
room
so
that
respondent’s
counsel
could
be
present
at
the
taking
of
these
exemplars.
and
that,
in
fact,
is
the
procedure
that
was
followed
for
--
until
by
the
19
witnesses
who
did
provide
the
exemplars.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
no
sir.
but
i’m
trying
to
set
the
context
in
which
this
came
up
to
show
that
it
was
not
"material"
to
the
obligation
or
the
lack
of
obligation
of
mr.
dionisio
to
give
this
exemplars
that
the
grand
jury
for
other
purposes
directed
him
to
provide
the
exemplars
to
its
agent
down
the
hall.
that
was
not
an
--
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
he
was
an
agent
of
the
fbi
sworn
by
the
grand
jury
to
receive
these
exemplars
and
then
to
testify
what
further
processing
they
received.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
no
sir.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
we
have
a
clear
fifth
amendment
problem
there.
we’re
talking
about
evidence
that
the
grand
jury
putting
aside
the
location
of
the
giving
of
the
testimony,
we
think
that
there
is
no
fifth
or
fourth
amendment
obstacle
to
the
order
that
was
entered
here.
the
--
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
that
was
inside
the
grand
jury
room
and
that’s
the
thrust
of
my
position
that
his
refusal
was
categorical
just
like
the
refusal
in
the
bryan
case,
which
is
also
a
contempt
case.
and
there
was
never,
at
any
time,
a
objection
based
on
the
locale
for
the
giving
of
the
exemplar
and
the
government
would
have
been
quite
willing
as
the
court
order
itself
reflects
that
to
receive
the
exemplar
in
the
grand
jury
room
if
the
witness
didn’t
want
counsel
present
outside
the
grand
jury
room.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
that
appears
in
the
transcript.
it’s
not
printed
in
the
appendix,
but
the
transcript
i
believe
is
before
the
court
and
the
--
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
yes
sir.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
absolutely
none.
the
--
i
might
say
that
on
page
21
of
the
transcript
of
the
hearing
before
the
chief
judge
robson
on
february
19th,
a
government
counsel
brought
out
that
--
and
this
was
after
one
counsel
from
another
respondent,
had
asked
the
permission
to
be
present
in
the
grand
jury
room
when
his
witness
gave
the
exemplar
under
compulsion.
and
chief
judge
robson
denied
that
motion
saying
that
counsel
aren’t
allowed
in
the
grand
jury
room
and
government
counsel
said,
“your
honor
we’ve
anticipated
that
problem
and
that’s
why
we’ve
set
up
a
procedure
to
allow
this
exemplars
to
be
taken
out
of
the
--
outside
the
grand
jury
room,
so
that
counsel
can
be
present.”
that
appears
on
page
21
of
the
transcript
of
the
february
19th
hearing,
and
it
appears
later
on
that
the
counsel
were
actually
present.
the
context
that
we
find
ourselves
in
then
is
one
in
which
a
witness
lawfully
before
the
grand
jury
has
been
ordered
to
give
evidence,
which
is
essentially
evidence
that
he
carries
with
him,
and
this
is
not
even
a
subpoena
duces
tecum
to
bring
in
his
personal
effects
from
somewhere
else.
this
is
evidence,
evidence
of
his
own
physical
characteristics,
identifying
characteristics
that
he
has
been
ordered
to
provide
to
the
grand
jury,
which
is
no
different,
we
submit
for
fourth
amendment
purposes
than
would
be
compelling
him
to
give
testimonial
evidence.
again
assuming
no
fifth
amendment
problem,
the
witness
under
what
we
con
--
we
believe
to
be
settled
principles,
is
obliged
to
cooperate
in
the
grand
jury’s
investigation
in
its
search
for
truth
by
providing
whatever
information
or
evidence
he
can
provide
at
that
time.
in
typical
grand
jury
proceedings
that
involves
his
formulation
of
an
answer
to
a
particular
question
that
calls
for
information
that
he
has
within
himself.
in
this
context,
what
the
witnesses
is
asked
for
is
to
give
information,
evidence
that
is
similarly
important
to
the
grand
jury
for
its
investigation
as
the
petition
alleged.
this
is
also
evidence
that
he
has
with
him
at
that
time,
its
evidence
about
his
own
physical
characteristics.
now,
chief
judge
friendly
in
the
schwartz
case,
which
rejects
the
rationale
of
the
seventh
circuit
here,
says
that,
“this
doesn’t
implicate
any
fourth
amendment
rights
at
all,
because
these
identifying
physical
characteristics,
voice,
or
in
mara,
handwriting
are
not
characteristics
as
to
which
any
person
has
a
reasonable
expectation
of
privacy.”
and
for
this
reason
--
in
judge
friendly’s
analysis
were
not
even
talking
about
a
search
or
a
seizure
within
fourth
amendment
terms.
this
is
simply
the
requirement
of
giving
of
testimony
or
evidence
which
is
no
different
from
the
formulation
of
oral
responses
by
a
grand
jury
witness
lawfully
before
the
grand
jury.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
well,
we’d
have
a
slightly
different
analysis,
because
of
the
reasonable
expectation
of
privacy,
but
i’d
be
prepared
to
say
the
grand
jury
could
insist
on
that
too.
and
i
think
that
that
brings
us
right
to
davis
against
mississippi,
which
is
perhaps
the
heart
of
the
case.
the
seventh
circuit,
i
think,
misunderstood
that
and
i’m
happy
to
be
able
to
rely
on
judge
--
chief
judge
friendly
as
having
correctly,
in
our
view,
understood
davis.
in
davis,
the
court’s
analysis
was
not
whether
fingerprints,
abstractly
considered
are
protected
by
the
fourth
amendment
whether
it’s
a
right
to
privacy
in
a
man’s
fingerprints.
the
analysis
there
was,
as
the
court
formulated
the
question,
can
fingerprints,
taken
in
the
course
of
unlawful
police
detention,
be
used
against
the
14-year
old
black
to
convict
him
with
rape?
we
don’t
have
that
problem
here.
the
witness
was
lawfully
before
the
grand
jury.
chief
judge
robson
recognized
that
that
was
the
determinative
factor.
chief
judge
friendly
has
said
the
same
thing.
and
i
think
the
court’s
own
an
explanation
in
davis
that
there
is
no
prying
into
private
thoughts
or
personal
information
when
fingerprints
are
obtained,
supports
judge
friendly’s
analysis
that
this
really
isn’t
a
search
or
seizure
problem,
assuming
that
the
police
--
that
the
government
citizen
contact
itself
is
lawful,
as
we
submit
it
is
under
the
fourth
amendment
when
a
grand
jury
process
is
being
used
not
a
street
confrontation
during
the
police
investigation.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
not
of
it
self.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
yes
sir.
we
regard
davis
as
a
taint
case,
a
wong
sun
kind
of
case
and
whatever
evidence
he
had
given
would
have
been
inadmissible
--
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
that’s
our
position.
if
there
are
no
further
questions
i
would
like
to
reserve
any
further
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
yes
two
points
mr.
chief
justice.
first
of
all
on
the
question
of
what
the
government’s
contentions
are
in
this
case,
i
should
point
out
that
we
are
not
here
pressing
the
notion
that
nothing
that
a
grand
jury
might
demand
would
be
covered
by
the
fourth
amendment.
we
do
not
have
a
case
where
the
grand
jury
was
demanding
that
a
person
strip
down
to
his
shorts
or
beyond,
do
not
demand
--
have
a
grand
jury
demand
for
semen,
not
have
a
grand
jury
demand
that
someone
bring
in
a
gun
from
his
home.
we
simply
have
a
grand
jury
demand
that
a
witness
properly
before
the
grand
jury
make
available
to
the
grand
jury
those
identifying
physical
characteristics
as
to
which
there
is
no
reasonable
expectation
of
privacy,
here
voice
and
in
the
mara
case,
handwriting.
that’s
far
as
we
are
going
in
these
cases,
i
think
that’s
as
far
as
we
need
to
go.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
yes
sir.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
yes
sir.
that’s
the
limit
of
all
we’ve
urged
through
all
the
lower
courts
and
here.
secondly,
on
the
question
of
the
so-called
dragnet
while
it's
not
clear
that
a
grand
jury
has
to
believe
that
every
person
that
it
calls
before
it
has
relevant
evidence,
in
fact
i
think
the
laws
to
the
contrary.
here
the
record
will
show
that
each
of
the
witnesses
who
was
called
and
was
asked
for
an
exemplar
was
asked
to
read
a
different
transcript,
a
different
grand
jury
exhibit.
so
we
don’t
have
even
the
case
of
20
different
people
being
asked
to
read
the
same
transcript
to
see
which
of
those
20
might
have
been
the
voice
intercepted
in
giving
that
transcript.
also,
related
to
that
is
the
reference
that
my
counsel
have
--
for
the
respondent
has
mentioned
about
the
subsequent
indictment
return
by
this
grand
jury
in
the
subsequent
suppression,
20
of
the
21
people
who
were
called
before
the
grand
jury,
all
but
mr.
dionisio
have
been
indicted.
and
that
also,
i
think
under
cuts
of
dragnet
of
possibility
on
the
gilbert
problem,
we
should
point
out
that
the
district
judge
that
suppressed
the
evidence
here
did
not
rule
that
there
was
no
probable
cause
or
that
the
search,
the
interceptions
were
unconstitutional.
in
fact,
the
sufficiency
of
the
indictments
has
been
upheld.
the
evidence,
the
interceptions
have
been
suppressed
because
the
district
judge
believed,
the
justice
department
followed
improper
internal
procedures
in
securing
approval
for
applying
to
the
court
for
the
interceptions.
that
issue
is
before
this
court
in
the
piscano
case,
its
number
71-1410,
the
second
circuit
again
speaking
through
judge
friendly
has
explicitly
upheld
the
validity
of
the
procedure
that
the
department
followed
in
applying
for
this
wiretaps.
the
eight
circuit
has
apparently
also
upheld
it.
the
issue
is
pending
en
banc
in
the
third
and
the
fifth
circuits
and
i
believe
has
been
argued
in
the
fourth
and
the
ninth
but
essentially
the
presentation
here
is
that
the
evidence
that
was
to
be
used
as
the
basis
for
the
exemplars
has
not
been
suppressed
on
any
constitutional
or
lack
of
probable
cost
grounds
but
simply
on
what
the
district
judge
thought
was
the
improper
internal
procedure
in
applying
for
the
court
orders.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
in
that
sense
as
the
district
courts
found
violate
the
statute.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
i
think
counsel’s
argument
is
a
very
reasonable
one
that
if
the
district
court
is
ultimately
sustained
in
suppressing
the
evidence
of
the
25,
15
would
preclude
the
use
by
the
government
of
this
evidence
before
the
grand
jury.
thank
you.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case,
united
states
against
dionisio
and
the
next
case
on
the
court's
calendar
this
morning,
united
states
against
mara,
both
raised
important
questions
about
the
ability
of
federal
grand
juries
to
obtain
exemplar
evidence
from
recalcitrant
witnesses.
both
cases
are
here
on
writs
of
certiorari
applied
for
by
the
united
states
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit.
in
this
case,
the
proceedings
began
when
a
special
federal
grand
jury
sitting
in
the
northern
district
of
illinois,
the
special
february
1971
grand
jury,
subpoenaed
mr.
dionisio
and
approximately
20
others
in
a
gambling
investigation
that
the
special
grand
jury
was
conducting.
mr.
dionisio
and
others
were
ordered
by
the
grand
jury
foreman
to
give
voice
exemplars
and
this
was
explained
to
them
to
be
the
reading
of
a
transcript
over
a
telephone
connected
to
a
recording
device.
mr.
dionisio
refused
to
give
the
exemplars
as
directed
by
the
grand
jury
foreman
and
as
did
other
grand
jury
witnesses
and
the
government,
thereafter
filed
petitions
to
obtain
court
orders
to
compel
the
furnishing
of
the
voice
exemplars.
the
government’s
petition
against
mr.
dionisio
alleged
that
the
special
grand
jury
was
investigating
violations
of
federal
criminal
statutes
that
the
grand
jury
thought
it
necessary
and
essential
to
obtain
a
voice
exemplar
of
mr.
dionisio’s
voice
on
the
telephone
for
the
sole
purpose
of
comparing
his
voice
as
recorded
with
voices
intercepted
pursuant
to
court
orders
issued
by
the
federal
district
court.
the
government
also
alleged
that
the
transcript
that
mr.
dionisio
had
been
asked
to
read
was
special
grand
jury
exhibit
13,
which
the
petition
stated
consisted
of
names,
numbers
and
races,
names
of
horses,
numbers
of
horses
and
races
and
certain
other
information.
a
hearing
on
petition
in
this
matter,
as
well
as
the
petitions
with
respect
to
the
other
20
or
so
recalcitrant
witnesses
was
held
before
chief
judge
robson
of
the
district
court.
and
at
that
hearing,
it
was
brought
out
that
what
the
government
was
seeking
was
compliance
with
what
was
termed
a
reasonable
order
of
the
grand
jury.
and
this
was
explained
to
mean
that
if
an
exemplar
that
was
clear
was
given
only
one
exemplar
would
be
necessary
that
on
the
basis
of
similar
requests,
several
days
earlier,
exemplars
had
been
given
by
other
witnesses
and
the
time
consumed
had
been
no
more
than
10
or
20
minutes.
that
the
government
would
preserve
any
and
all
original
exemplars
for
subsequent
comparison
and
expert
analysis
including
by
the
defense
and
that
counsel
could
be
present
during
the
taking
of
the
exemplars,
because
the
expected
procedure
would
be
that
the
exemplar
would
be
given
before
a
specially
designated
agent
of
the
grand
jury
outside
the
grand
jury
room.
chief
judge
robson
entered
orders
directing
each
of
the
witnesses
including
mr.
dionisio
to
provide
the
exemplars.
19
of
the
21
witnesses
did
provide
the
exemplars
under
court
order.
mr.
dionisio
and
one
other
witness
whose
petition
was
ultimately
dismissed
by
the
government
refused
to
give
the
exemplars
asserting
fourth
and
fifth
amendment
defenses.
the
court
entered
an
opinion,
which
is
reprinted
in
the
appendix
to
our
certiorari
petition
in
which
both
the
fourth
amendment
and
fifth
amendment
claims
were
rejected.
on
the
fourth
amendment
issue,
chief
judge
robson
held
that
since
the
grand
jury
subpoenas
were
lawful,
the
witnesses
were
properly
subject
to
these
directions,
were
not
in
unlawful
detention
within
the
meaning
of
this
court’s
decision
in
davis
against
mississippi
and
relying
on
this
court's
decisions
in
gilbert,
wade
and
other
cases
held
that
no
fifth
amendment
values
are
impinged
upon
by
requiring
a
person
to
give
exemplars.
when
mr.
dionisio
refused
an
open
court
to
give
the
exemplars,
he
was
committed
for
contempt
until
he
complied
with
the
order
or
until
the
expiration
of
18
months
which
is
the
maximum
statutory
imprisonment
for
civil
contempt.
on
appeal,
after
mr.
dionisio
had
been
released
on
bond
by
the
seventh
circuit,
the
court
of
appeals
rejected
fifth
amendment
claims,
as
well
as
any
possible
sixth
amendment
claim,
but
found
that
the
fourth
amendment
defense
was
a
valid
one.
the
court
ruled
that
before
a
grand
jury
may
compel
a
witness
before
it
to
give
exemplars
of
his
voice,
the
government
must
make
an
affirmative
factual
showing
that
this
request
is
reasonable.
the
court
apparently
believed
that
the
petition
and
the
hearing
that
were
--
was
held
on
the
government’s
petition
did
not
satisfy
that
reasonable
--
reasonableness
of
request
and
the
court
reversed
the
contempt
judgment.
the
ground
for
decision
by
the
seventh
circuit
was
essentially
that
exemplars
maybe
covered
by
the
fourth
amendment
relying
here
on
the
same
case
that
the
district
court
had
found
not
applicable,
davis
against
mississippi.
and
also
that
the
fourth
amendment
applies
to
grand
jury
proceedings
and
the
court
relied
on
one
or
two
decisions
of
this
court
in
which
the
court
stated
that
grand
jury
subpoenas
for
the
production
of
documents
might
be
so
broad
and
ill-defined
as
to
constitute
an
unreasonable
search.
the
government
petition
for
rehearing
en
banc
that
was
denied
by
a
5:3
vote
and
in
august
of
1971
we
filed
the
petition
for
certiorari.
in
may
of
1972,
after
we
filed
a
supplemental
memorandum
calling
to
the
court’s
attention
in
intervening
decision
by
chief
judge
friendly
of
the
second
circuit,
which
had
explicitly
rejected
the
rationale
of
the
dionisio
case,
court
granted
certiorari.
the
issue
then
in
this
first
case
is
whether,
when
a
grand
jury
witness
has
been
properly
called
before
an
investigating
grand
jury,
the
fourth
amendment
requires
that
before
a
witness
can
be
compelled
to
give
exemplars
of
his
voice,
or
as
in
mara
exemplars
of
his
handwriting,
the
government
must
make
an
affirmative
factual
showing
that
this
request
is
reasonable.
it’s
the
government’s
petition
--
position
that
no
such
requirement
of
affirmative
factual
showing
of
reasonableness
is
necessary
under
the
fourth
amendment
and
that
the
decision
below
constitutes
a
departure
from
settled
principles
of
grand
jury
practice
and
settled
principles
of
the
application
of
the
fourth
amendment.
we
think
the
appropriate
place
to
start
in
this
case,
as
chief
judge
friendly
in
the
schwartz
case
has
done,
is
with
the
nature
of
the
grand
jury
itself.
there
is
no
need,
i
think,
for
us
to
rehearse
at
any
great
length
the
principles
governing
grand
jury
investigations,
since
only
last
term
the
court
had
a
number
of
such
cases
before
it.
but
briefly
the
relevant
context
here
is
this.
a
grand
jury
is
the
touchstone
of
the
criminal
process
under
the
federal
system
since
only
a
grand
jury
can
initiate
felony
prosecutions.
the
grand
jury
for
several
hundred
years
has
had
the
undisputed
right
to
compulsory
process.
this
court
has
explained
that
compulsory
process
involves
not
only
the
justifiable
demand
that
every
witness
appear
before
the
grand
jury,
but
that
every
witness
unless
his
testimony
is
privileged
must
testify
before
the
grand
jury
in
its
search
for
truth.
the
last
term
in
a
decision
which
has
been
rendered
by
this
court
since
the
seventh
circuit’s
decision
in
the
two
cases
before
the
court
this
morning,
the
court
rejected
the
very
kind
of
preliminary
showing
that
the
seventh
circuit
has
imposed
in
these
cases
in
branzburg,
caldwell,
and
pappas,
will
be
recalled
where
important
first
amendment
rights
were
unquestionably
involved
as
none
of
the
justices
of
the
court
disputed.
the
court
nevertheless
said
that
in
light
of
the
historic
function
of
the
grand
jury
even
where
it
was
possible
that
there
might
be
some
collateral
impact
on
first
amendment
values.
nevertheless,
a
newsman
subpoenaed
before
a
grand
jury
had
an
obligation
to
appear
and
had
an
obligation
to
testify
and
in
rendering
that
decision
the
court
explicitly
rejected
the
suggestion
that
even
in
order
to
protect
these
first
amendment
rights
some
preliminary
showing
should
be
made
before
the
newsman
was
compelled
to
respond
to
the
subpoena.
the
showing
that
was
suggested
by
the
lower
courts
by
the
dissent
in
branzburg
was
remarkably
similar
to
the
showing
of
reasonableness
that
the
seventh
circuit
has
imposed
in
these
cases.
and
it’s
our
position
that
a
showing,
in
this
context,
is
no
more
justified
than
in
the
branzburg,
caldwell,
and
pappas
context.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
yes
sir.
the
second
case
this
morning
involves
the
follow
up
decision
by
the
seventh
circuit
of
the
--
nature
of
the
proceeding
that
must
be
held
to
demonstrate
reasonableness
and
the
substantive
content
of
the
reasonableness.
but
if
this
court
decides
that
the
seventh
circuit
erred
in
dionisio
in
saying
that
there
is
this
kind
of
constitutional
requirement,
the
second
case,
in
our
judgment,
becomes
academic.
the
contention
by
the
seventh
circuit
which
is,
of
course,
defended
by
the
respondents
in
these
cases
is
that
compelling
a
witness
to
provide
this
kind
of
exemplar
evidence
is
covered
by
the
fourth
amendment,
even
though,
as
the
seventh
circuit
itself
is
conceded,
the
fourth
amendment,
governing
unreasonable
seizures
of
persons,
does
not
apply
to
summoning
a
witness
before
a
grand
jury.
it
has
never
been
held
and
no
court
that
i
am
aware
of
has
ever
suggested
that
a
general
--
as
a
general
principle,
the
government
or
the
grand
jury
must
make
a
preliminary
showing
of
reasonableness
before
a
witness
can
be
compelled
to
appear
and
testify
before
a
grand
jury.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
well
it
is.
it’s
the
giving
of
evidence.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
it’s
not
testimonial
--
pardon
me.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
that
was
the
procedure
that
was
contemplated.
the
order,
the
petition
--
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
yes
sir.
if
this
is
the
giving
of
evidence
before
the
grand
jury
--
that’s
a
grand
jury’s
direction.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
well,
i
can
answer
that
question
--
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
--
by
saying
that
the
petition
that
the
government
filed
and
the
order
that
was
entered
in
both
of
these
cases
did
not
require
that
the
evidence
and
the
testimony,
if
you
will,
be
given
outside
the
grand
jury
room.
this
was
the
procedure
that
the
government
proposed
so
that
counsel
could
be
present
during
the
taking
of
the
exemplars.
this
was
thought
to
be
a
benefit
before
the
witness.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
he
was
asked
that
he
would
give
exemplars,
and
he
refused
on
fourth
and
fifth
amendment
grounds.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
my
answer
to
that
question
and
i
don’t
think
it’s
evasive,
it’s
that
yes.
what
he
was
ordered
to
do
by
the
district
court,
and
that’s
what’s
on
challenge
here,
was
to
provide
exemplars
as
it
deemed
necessary
by
the
grand
jury
either
before
and
to
the
grand
jury
--
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
well,
it’s
testimony
in
the
sense
that
--
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
well,
i
can’t
answer
yes
or
no
and
be
fair
to
the
court.
it’s
testimony
in
the
sense
that
it’s
--
what
he
is
--
it
is
evidence
that
he
is
obliged
to
give
in
the
presence
of
the
grand
jury
pursuant
to
the
grand
jury
subpoena.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
yes.
if
--
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
he
can
refuse
--
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
he
refused
to
give
an
exemplar.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
yes
sir.
the
order
that’s
been
entered
states
--
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
the
grand
jury
called
him,
explained
that
he
was
a
potential
defendant
and
that
he
had
fifth
and
sixth
amendment
rights,
and
asked
him
whether
he
would
give
a
voice
exemplar
if
ordered
to
give
one.
it
was
explained
to
him
and
i
understand
the
thrust
of
your
question
that
the
procedure
that
was
contemplated
was
that
the
telephone
into
which
he
was
being
directed
to
speak
was
in
another
office
on
that
same
floor.
he
did
not
object
on
that
ground
in
the
district
court,
i
must
say,
either
before
the
grand
jury
or
in
court
and
i
think
the
order
that
has
been
entered
against
him
on
the
government’s
petition
would
be
satisfied
if
mr.
dionisio
had
said,
“i
will
give
this
testimony
in
the
grand
jury
room
but
not
outside.”
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
well,
there
we
have
a
fifth
amendment
problem.
we’re
talking
here
--
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
well,
we’re
talking
here
about
evidence
which
i
believe
the
grand
jury
was
entitled
lawfully
to
compel
mr.
dionisio
to
give
in
the
grand
jury
room
and
the
fact
that
--
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
the
alternative
procedure
that
was
set
up
here
was
not
a
condition,
on
the
government’s
part,
it
made
no
difference.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
he
was
asked
to
refer
--
to
the
grand
jury
testimony,
he
was
asked
whether
he
would
give
voice
exemplars,
and
he
said,
“no”
and
he
claimed
the
fourth
and
fifth
amendment
--
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
after
he
was
told
what
the
procedure
was,
he
was
asked
whether
he
could
give
exemplars.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
no
sir,
no,
because
at
the
hearing
--
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
yes
sir.
i
think
the
reading
of
the
transcript
of
the
hearing
before
chief
judge
robson,
will
show
that
the
orders
that
were
being
entered,
were
to
direct
the
witnesses
to
give
these
exemplars
and
at
that
time
they
were
being
entered
and
argued
on
the
merits,
it
was
not
clear
to
judge
robson
that
the
procedure
that
was
expected
for
purposes
of
defense
counsel
being
in
attendant
was
to
have
them
given
in
before
specially
designated
agent
of
the
grand
jury
outside
the
grand
jury
room.
but
what
judge
robson
asked
the
counsel
and
the
respondent
in
each
of
these
cases
was,
“will
you
give
the
exemplars?”
it
was
not,
“will
you
give
them
outside
the
grand
jury
room?”
and
as
i
say,
the
order
that
was
entered
was
not
limited
to
giving
them
outside
the
grand
jury
room
and
there
would
have
been
no
contempt
here.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
well,
he
refused,
while
in
the
grand
jury
room,
to
give
exemplars.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
no,
the
only
evidence
that
he
was
asked
to
give
in
the
grand
jury
room
by
the
grand
jury
was
the
exemplars.
on
this
point,
i
reiterate
that
the
order
that
was
entered
by
chief
judge
robson
and
the
order
that
was
asked
for
by
the
government
provide
it
with
a
giving
of
exemplars
either
before
and
to
the
grand
jury
or
to
a
specially
designated
agent
of
the
grand
jury
who
had
been
sworn
by
the
grand
jury
previously
to
receive
this
evidence
so
that,
as
i
say,
there
was
also
no
objection
on
the
ground
that
this
was
beyond
the
power
of
the
grand
jury
to
do.
and
we
suggest
the
case
of
bryan
against
the
united
states
in
339
u.s.
is
dispositive
of
this
point,
since
this
objection
was
not
made
by
the
witnesses,
it
was
not
the
basis
for
his
objection
and
if
that
objection
had
been
made,
the
government
of
course
would
have
been
quite
willing
to
receive
the
exemplars
in
the
grand
jury
room.
but
as
the
transcript
of
the
hearing
makes
it
clear,
mr.
justice
marshall,
the
government
counsel
said
that
the
procedure
that
was
contemplated
was
outside
the
grand
jury
room
so
that
respondent’s
counsel
could
be
present
at
the
taking
of
these
exemplars.
and
that,
in
fact,
is
the
procedure
that
was
followed
for
--
until
by
the
19
witnesses
who
did
provide
the
exemplars.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
no
sir.
but
i’m
trying
to
set
the
context
in
which
this
came
up
to
show
that
it
was
not
"material"
to
the
obligation
or
the
lack
of
obligation
of
mr.
dionisio
to
give
this
exemplars
that
the
grand
jury
for
other
purposes
directed
him
to
provide
the
exemplars
to
its
agent
down
the
hall.
that
was
not
an
--
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
he
was
an
agent
of
the
fbi
sworn
by
the
grand
jury
to
receive
these
exemplars
and
then
to
testify
what
further
processing
they
received.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
no
sir.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
we
have
a
clear
fifth
amendment
problem
there.
we’re
talking
about
evidence
that
the
grand
jury
putting
aside
the
location
of
the
giving
of
the
testimony,
we
think
that
there
is
no
fifth
or
fourth
amendment
obstacle
to
the
order
that
was
entered
here.
the
--
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
that
was
inside
the
grand
jury
room
and
that’s
the
thrust
of
my
position
that
his
refusal
was
categorical
just
like
the
refusal
in
the
bryan
case,
which
is
also
a
contempt
case.
and
there
was
never,
at
any
time,
a
objection
based
on
the
locale
for
the
giving
of
the
exemplar
and
the
government
would
have
been
quite
willing
as
the
court
order
itself
reflects
that
to
receive
the
exemplar
in
the
grand
jury
room
if
the
witness
didn’t
want
counsel
present
outside
the
grand
jury
room.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
that
appears
in
the
transcript.
it’s
not
printed
in
the
appendix,
but
the
transcript
i
believe
is
before
the
court
and
the
--
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
yes
sir.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
absolutely
none.
the
--
i
might
say
that
on
page
21
of
the
transcript
of
the
hearing
before
the
chief
judge
robson
on
february
19th,
a
government
counsel
brought
out
that
--
and
this
was
after
one
counsel
from
another
respondent,
had
asked
the
permission
to
be
present
in
the
grand
jury
room
when
his
witness
gave
the
exemplar
under
compulsion.
and
chief
judge
robson
denied
that
motion
saying
that
counsel
aren’t
allowed
in
the
grand
jury
room
and
government
counsel
said,
“your
honor
we’ve
anticipated
that
problem
and
that’s
why
we’ve
set
up
a
procedure
to
allow
this
exemplars
to
be
taken
out
of
the
--
outside
the
grand
jury
room,
so
that
counsel
can
be
present.”
that
appears
on
page
21
of
the
transcript
of
the
february
19th
hearing,
and
it
appears
later
on
that
the
counsel
were
actually
present.
the
context
that
we
find
ourselves
in
then
is
one
in
which
a
witness
lawfully
before
the
grand
jury
has
been
ordered
to
give
evidence,
which
is
essentially
evidence
that
he
carries
with
him,
and
this
is
not
even
a
subpoena
duces
tecum
to
bring
in
his
personal
effects
from
somewhere
else.
this
is
evidence,
evidence
of
his
own
physical
characteristics,
identifying
characteristics
that
he
has
been
ordered
to
provide
to
the
grand
jury,
which
is
no
different,
we
submit
for
fourth
amendment
purposes
than
would
be
compelling
him
to
give
testimonial
evidence.
again
assuming
no
fifth
amendment
problem,
the
witness
under
what
we
con
--
we
believe
to
be
settled
principles,
is
obliged
to
cooperate
in
the
grand
jury’s
investigation
in
its
search
for
truth
by
providing
whatever
information
or
evidence
he
can
provide
at
that
time.
in
typical
grand
jury
proceedings
that
involves
his
formulation
of
an
answer
to
a
particular
question
that
calls
for
information
that
he
has
within
himself.
in
this
context,
what
the
witnesses
is
asked
for
is
to
give
information,
evidence
that
is
similarly
important
to
the
grand
jury
for
its
investigation
as
the
petition
alleged.
this
is
also
evidence
that
he
has
with
him
at
that
time,
its
evidence
about
his
own
physical
characteristics.
now,
chief
judge
friendly
in
the
schwartz
case,
which
rejects
the
rationale
of
the
seventh
circuit
here,
says
that,
“this
doesn’t
implicate
any
fourth
amendment
rights
at
all,
because
these
identifying
physical
characteristics,
voice,
or
in
mara,
handwriting
are
not
characteristics
as
to
which
any
person
has
a
reasonable
expectation
of
privacy.”
and
for
this
reason
--
in
judge
friendly’s
analysis
were
not
even
talking
about
a
search
or
a
seizure
within
fourth
amendment
terms.
this
is
simply
the
requirement
of
giving
of
testimony
or
evidence
which
is
no
different
from
the
formulation
of
oral
responses
by
a
grand
jury
witness
lawfully
before
the
grand
jury.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
well,
we’d
have
a
slightly
different
analysis,
because
of
the
reasonable
expectation
of
privacy,
but
i’d
be
prepared
to
say
the
grand
jury
could
insist
on
that
too.
and
i
think
that
that
brings
us
right
to
davis
against
mississippi,
which
is
perhaps
the
heart
of
the
case.
the
seventh
circuit,
i
think,
misunderstood
that
and
i’m
happy
to
be
able
to
rely
on
judge
--
chief
judge
friendly
as
having
correctly,
in
our
view,
understood
davis.
in
davis,
the
court’s
analysis
was
not
whether
fingerprints,
abstractly
considered
are
protected
by
the
fourth
amendment
whether
it’s
a
right
to
privacy
in
a
man’s
fingerprints.
the
analysis
there
was,
as
the
court
formulated
the
question,
can
fingerprints,
taken
in
the
course
of
unlawful
police
detention,
be
used
against
the
14-year
old
black
to
convict
him
with
rape?
we
don’t
have
that
problem
here.
the
witness
was
lawfully
before
the
grand
jury.
chief
judge
robson
recognized
that
that
was
the
determinative
factor.
chief
judge
friendly
has
said
the
same
thing.
and
i
think
the
court’s
own
an
explanation
in
davis
that
there
is
no
prying
into
private
thoughts
or
personal
information
when
fingerprints
are
obtained,
supports
judge
friendly’s
analysis
that
this
really
isn’t
a
search
or
seizure
problem,
assuming
that
the
police
--
that
the
government
citizen
contact
itself
is
lawful,
as
we
submit
it
is
under
the
fourth
amendment
when
a
grand
jury
process
is
being
used
not
a
street
confrontation
during
the
police
investigation.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
not
of
it
self.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
yes
sir.
we
regard
davis
as
a
taint
case,
a
wong
sun
kind
of
case
and
whatever
evidence
he
had
given
would
have
been
inadmissible
--
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
that’s
our
position.
if
there
are
no
further
questions
i
would
like
to
reserve
any
further
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
yes
two
points
mr.
chief
justice.
first
of
all
on
the
question
of
what
the
government’s
contentions
are
in
this
case,
i
should
point
out
that
we
are
not
here
pressing
the
notion
that
nothing
that
a
grand
jury
might
demand
would
be
covered
by
the
fourth
amendment.
we
do
not
have
a
case
where
the
grand
jury
was
demanding
that
a
person
strip
down
to
his
shorts
or
beyond,
do
not
demand
--
have
a
grand
jury
demand
for
semen,
not
have
a
grand
jury
demand
that
someone
bring
in
a
gun
from
his
home.
we
simply
have
a
grand
jury
demand
that
a
witness
properly
before
the
grand
jury
make
available
to
the
grand
jury
those
identifying
physical
characteristics
as
to
which
there
is
no
reasonable
expectation
of
privacy,
here
voice
and
in
the
mara
case,
handwriting.
that’s
far
as
we
are
going
in
these
cases,
i
think
that’s
as
far
as
we
need
to
go.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
yes
sir.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
yes
sir.
that’s
the
limit
of
all
we’ve
urged
through
all
the
lower
courts
and
here.
secondly,
on
the
question
of
the
so-called
dragnet
while
it's
not
clear
that
a
grand
jury
has
to
believe
that
every
person
that
it
calls
before
it
has
relevant
evidence,
in
fact
i
think
the
laws
to
the
contrary.
here
the
record
will
show
that
each
of
the
witnesses
who
was
called
and
was
asked
for
an
exemplar
was
asked
to
read
a
different
transcript,
a
different
grand
jury
exhibit.
so
we
don’t
have
even
the
case
of
20
different
people
being
asked
to
read
the
same
transcript
to
see
which
of
those
20
might
have
been
the
voice
intercepted
in
giving
that
transcript.
also,
related
to
that
is
the
reference
that
my
counsel
have
--
for
the
respondent
has
mentioned
about
the
subsequent
indictment
return
by
this
grand
jury
in
the
subsequent
suppression,
20
of
the
21
people
who
were
called
before
the
grand
jury,
all
but
mr.
dionisio
have
been
indicted.
and
that
also,
i
think
under
cuts
of
dragnet
of
possibility
on
the
gilbert
problem,
we
should
point
out
that
the
district
judge
that
suppressed
the
evidence
here
did
not
rule
that
there
was
no
probable
cause
or
that
the
search,
the
interceptions
were
unconstitutional.
in
fact,
the
sufficiency
of
the
indictments
has
been
upheld.
the
evidence,
the
interceptions
have
been
suppressed
because
the
district
judge
believed,
the
justice
department
followed
improper
internal
procedures
in
securing
approval
for
applying
to
the
court
for
the
interceptions.
that
issue
is
before
this
court
in
the
piscano
case,
its
number
71-1410,
the
second
circuit
again
speaking
through
judge
friendly
has
explicitly
upheld
the
validity
of
the
procedure
that
the
department
followed
in
applying
for
this
wiretaps.
the
eight
circuit
has
apparently
also
upheld
it.
the
issue
is
pending
en
banc
in
the
third
and
the
fifth
circuits
and
i
believe
has
been
argued
in
the
fourth
and
the
ninth
but
essentially
the
presentation
here
is
that
the
evidence
that
was
to
be
used
as
the
basis
for
the
exemplars
has
not
been
suppressed
on
any
constitutional
or
lack
of
probable
cost
grounds
but
simply
on
what
the
district
judge
thought
was
the
improper
internal
procedure
in
applying
for
the
court
orders.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
in
that
sense
as
the
district
courts
found
violate
the
statute.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
i
think
counsel’s
argument
is
a
very
reasonable
one
that
if
the
district
court
is
ultimately
sustained
in
suppressing
the
evidence
of
the
25,
15
would
preclude
the
use
by
the
government
of
this
evidence
before
the
grand
jury.
thank
you.
