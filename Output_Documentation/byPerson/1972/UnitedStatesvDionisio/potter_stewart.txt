if
there's
no
invasion
of
either
the
fourth
and
fifth
amendment,
you
don’t
even
get
to
this
question
of
what
kind
of
a
proceeding
is
involved
here?
justice
potter
stewart
do
you
suppose
a
grand
jury
could
tell
a
man
that,
“to
go
to
that
table
and
put
your
fingerprints
on
each
--
on
that
ink
pad,
we
want
the
fingerprint
of
every
one
of
your
fingers?”
justice
potter
stewart
in
other
words,
it’s
your
submission
as
i
understand
it
that
the
compulsory
giving
of
fingerprints
is
not
of
itself
a
violation
of
either
the
fourth
or
the
fifth
amendment?
justice
potter
stewart
and
that
the
rationale
of
davis
was
that
this
was
done
during
an
unlawful
detention
which
violated
the
fourth
amendment.
justice
potter
stewart
and
that
here
there
is
no
unlawful
detention,
there
is
merely
a
summoning
of
a
person
before
the
grand
jury.
that’s
your
argument?
justice
potter
stewart
at
the
risk
of
repeating
--
justice
potter
stewart
would
you
summarize
again
on
what
happened
with
this
other
man?
justice
potter
stewart
and
that
was
--
those
were
motions
to
suppress.
justice
potter
stewart
and
they
were
upheld
by
the
district
court.
justice
potter
stewart
right.
and
then
the
government
appealed
that?
justice
potter
stewart
and
that’s
not
pending
in
the
court
of
appeals
of
the
seventh
circuit.
justice

stewart
how
about
it
--
mr.
crowley.
justice
potter
stewart
what
if
the
grand
jury
asked
the
witness
to
bring
before
to
roll
up
his
sleeves
so
they
could
see
whether
or
not
he
had
a
tattoo
on
his
upper
arm?
justice
potter
stewart
so
that
would
require
an
act
of
will.
justice

stewart
could
ask
him
to
strip
down
to
his
shorts
to
see
if
he
had
something
