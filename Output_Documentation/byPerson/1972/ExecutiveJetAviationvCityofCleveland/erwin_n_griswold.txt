mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
think
that
this
is
the
first
time
that
i
have
ever
been
a
proctor
in
admiralty
to
which
i
was
admitted
some
years
ago.
let
me
start
by
restating
the
facts
of
the
case
which
are
illustrated
by
this
chart.
here
is
in
the
brief
for
the
city
of
cleveland
and
is
plaintiffs
exhibit
4
in
the
case.
north
is
to
the
right
which
is
perhaps
a
little
misleading,
but
if
i
took
the
chart
to
side
and
the
lettering
is
hard
to
read,
the
plane
started
here
at
the
runway
at
the
gate,
came
to
the
end
of
the
sixth
left
runway
and
started
down
the
runway
to
the
north-east.
at
this
place,
where
it
says
‘rotate
area’,
that
is
airplane
language
for
takeoff.
what
you
do
is
rotate
the
nose
of
the
plane
and
the
takeoff
was
between
2,800
and
3,000
feet
down
the
runway.
the
bird
area
was
between
3,600
feet
and
6,200
feet.
but
before
the
plane
had
left
the
end
of
the
runway,
the
control
tower
had
said,
“caution,
birds
on
end
of
runway,”
and
that
appears
on
page
14
of
the
record
and
then
had
added,
“it
looks
like
there
are
a
million
of
them.”
now,
the
plane
started
down,
nevertheless,
and
took
off
at
2,800
feet.
when
it
took
off
the
bird
flushed
into
the
air.
the
plane
hit
the
birds
in
this
area
over
land,
as
mr.
bostwick
has
said,
314
dead
birds
were
found
on
the
runway
on
land
and
the
engines
of
the
plane
were
filled
with
ingested
birds.
the
plane
immediately
lost
power,
the
pilot
endeavored
to
take
what
steps
he
could
to
get
out
of
the
situation.
he
hit
the
perimeter
fence
of
the
airport
here
and
a
truck
which
was
parked
at
the
end
of
the
airport
and
this
statement
on
the
exhibit
e.
mca
is
mr.
mcavoy's
initial
which
he
put
on
the
exhibit
to
indicate
that
is
the
point
where
the
truck
was
hit,
all
of
this
of
this
of
course
is
on
land.
by
this
time,
the
plane
is
almost
hopelessly
disabled
and
it
was
a
miracle
that
it
finally
came
through
and
the
three
persons
on
board
came
out.
these
dotted
lines
are
the
course
of
the
plane
after
hitting
the
truck,
they
too
were
put
on
the
exhibit
as
the
testimony
of
mr.
mcavoy.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
mr.
mcavoy
is
a
witness
for
the
plaintiff.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
and
the
plane
finally
came
to
the
rest
--
to
rest
in
the
water
here
and
this
e.
mca
9
is
mr.
mcavoy's
testimony
that
represents
the
place
where
it
came
to
rest.
i
may
point
out
that
this
is
the
cleveland
breakwater
here,
all
of
this
is
inside
the
breakwater,
that
doesn't
mean
that
it
is
not
navigable
water,
but
it
is
not
the
high
sea
on
the
lake,
so
to
speak.
now
there
is
a
reference
in
the
briefs
to
the
fact
that
the
plane
came
to
rest
a
fifth
of
a
mile
from
the
under
the
runway.
that
is
literally
true,
this
being
the
end
the
runaway
and
it's
a
fifth
of
a
miles
there,
but
it
was
only
30
or
40
feet
from
land
to
the
north
that
the
plane
came
to
rest.
it's
clear
that
the
damage
to
the
engines
was
done
and
completed
before
the
plane
hit
the
water.
it
is
also
clear
that
there
was
substantial
damage
to
the
airframe
from
hitting
the
fence
and
the
truck
and
the
birds,
before
the
plane
hit
the
water.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
the
aircraft
was
here
at
the
end
of
the
runway
--
at
the
beginning
of
the
runway
before
takeoff.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
am
sorry,
sir.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
the
aircraft
had
not
started
into
the
air
at
the
time
of
warning
was
given.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
the
flight
need
not
have
started
at
all.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes,
the
tower
could
have
instructed
them
not
to
go
off.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
after
you
have
given
the
pilot,
the
information
there
is
a
quite
a
bit
of
a
practice
in
the
air
industry
that
the
decision
is
up
to
the
pilot,
not
to
the
controller
tower.
this
has
not
been
tried
in
this
case.
i
suppose,
this
bears
on
the
question
of
comparative
negligence
which
might
be
relevant
in
admiralty
and
the
contributory
negligence
which
would
be
relevant,
if
it
is
not
in
admiralty.
now
the
district
court
in
this
case,
dismiss
the
libel
in
admiralty.
it
found
that
it
is
manifest
that
the
alleged
negligence
became
operative
upon
the
aircraft,
the
pilot
was
over
the
land
and
it
added
whether
it
came
down
upon
land
or
upon
water,
was
largely
fortuitous,
and
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed
on
the
ground
that
the
tort
occurred
on
land.
it's
said
in
its
opinion
that
the
alleged
tort
occurred
on
land,
even
though
the
plane
fell
into
the
navigable
water
shortly
after
take
off
from
the
airport
and
that
no
right
of
action
is
cognizable
in
admiralty.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
number
three
is
hitting
the
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
perhaps,
yes,
that
is
perfectly
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
don’t
know
mr.
justice.
i
suppose
that’s
a
part
of
the
issue
in
this
case.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
there
are
two
defendants
here.
one,
the
city
of
cleveland
who
mr.
crocker
represents
and
the
other
the
tower
controller
and
employee
of
the
federal
government
whom
i
represent.
mr.
crocker
has
generously
given
all
of
the
time
to
me,
but
i
am
in
a
very
real
sense
representing
the
city
of
cleveland
as
well
as
the
airport
controller,
and
mr.
crocker
relies
more
heavily
on
this
question
of
where
was
the
tort
than
i
do
and
i
am
sure
that
the
court
will
give
careful
consideration
to
his
brief.
this
was
the
ground
upon
which
the
six
circuit
court
of
appeals
decided
the
case
and
it
relied
primarily
on
three
decisions.
now
i
know
it
is
perfectly
easy
to
go
through
this
court's
admiralty
cases
over
100
years
and
find
a
case
such
as
the
one
mr.
bostwick
referred
to,
the
plaintiff,
which
rather
refers
to
the
consequences
rather
than
to
the
point
of
impact.
the
three
cases
which
the
six
circuit
relied
on,
smith
&
son
against
taylor,
minnie
against
port
huron
terminal
company
and
finally
the
admiral
peoples
are
all
cases
in
which
the
court
made
the
decision
between
admiralty
and
non-admiralty
turn
on
the
point
of
injury
in
the
sense
of
point
of
impact.
in
smith
&
son
against
taylor
a
longshoreman
was
standing
on
a
stage
which
rested
on
a
port
and
projected
a
few
feet
over
the
water.
he
was
struck
by
a
sling
loaded
with
cargo
which
was
being
lowered
over
the
side
from
the
ship
and
not
into
the
water.
and
the
court
held
that
was
the
–
in
--
the
tort
was
on
land
and
not
in
sea
and
that
there
could
be
no
maritime
recovery.
the
next
case
minnie
against
port
huron
terminal
company
is
almost
exactly
the
converse
and
the
admiral
peoples
is
a
gangplank
case.
there
is
slip
and
fall.
he
slipped
and
fell
on
the
gangplank
and
hit
the
port
and
that
was
held
to
be
a
ship
injury,
because
the
slip
and
fall
was
on
the
gangplank.
now
the
only
case
that
really
deals
with
this
kind
of
accident
is
the
third
circuit's
decision
in
weinstein
against
eastern
airlines
and
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
though
decision
is
certainly
doctrinally
inconsistent
with
the
six
circuit,
there
are
no
facts
appeared
in
that
case
which
are
anything
like
the
facts
which
have
been
shown
here
with
respect
to
the
injuries
on
and
over
land.
for
the
weinstein
case
arose
on
a
motion
to
dismiss
and
the
libel
said
that
shortly
after
the
aircraft
had
become
airborne
by
reason
of
the
negligence
of
the
respondents
and
by
virtue
of
their
respective
breach
of
warranties,
said
aircraft
crashed
into
the
navigable
waters
of
boston
harbor.
and
that
is
all
the
allegation
there
is.
there
is
no
allegation
there
that
anything
happened
on
or
above
the
land
and
the
issue
arose
on
the
exceptions
of
the
eastern
airlines,
the
facts
averred
in
the
libel
do
not
constitute
a
cause
of
action
against
eastern
airlines
inc.
within
the
admiralty
jurisdiction
of
this
court.
i
would
like
to
devote
the
--
i
think
the
factual
situation
is
clear
to
the
court
and
the
basis
of
the
decision
below
appeared
clearly
in
its
opinion
and
we
rely
on
that.
but
i
would
like
to
devote
the
rest
of
my
argument
to
the
broader
question,
should
admiralty
law
apply
to
an
airplane
crash
of
this
sort?
by
that
i
am
not
weaving
the
place
of
the
tort
argument,
i
am
seeking
to
present
a
broader
ground.
the
only
reason
that
i
can
think
of
for
bringing
this
within
admiralty
is
a
purely
verbal
one,
namely
that
admiralty
applies
to
the
sea
or
in
this
country
to
in
the
navigable
waters
and
this
plane
landed
in
the
water
ergo,
admiralty
jurisdiction.
but
even
on
a
verbal
basis
if
we
start
by
saying
that
admiralty
relates
to
ships,
then
this
case
does
not
involve
a
ship
and
ergo,
no
admiralty
jurisdiction.
obviously,
both
of
these
approaches
are
essentially
formal,
i
am
not
suggesting
at
all,
of
course,
that
admiralty
must
be
confined
to
exactly
what
it
covered
in
1787
or
1789.
obviously,
the
constitution
should
be
construed
so
as
to
accommodate
new
developments.
admiralty
took
in
steamships
when
they
came
and
admiralty
was
rightly
extended
to
the
in
the
navigable
waters
of
the
united
states
which
were
something
not
paralleled
in
britain.
similarly,
the
constitution
gives
congress
power
with
respect
to
an
army
and
a
navy
and
no
one
questions
that,
that
applies
also
to
an
air
force.
but
it
does
not
follow
that
admiralty
should
extend
to
every
tort
which
occurs
on
water,
if
this
tort
did
occur
on
water
and
specifically
it
does
not
follow
that
admiralty
jurisdiction
should
be
found
to
extend
to
airplane
accidents
of
the
sort
involved
here.
there
is
no
decision
of
this
court
saying
that
any
sort
of
airplane
accident
is
within
admiralty
jurisdiction.
there
are
not
even
any
decisions
of
this
court
applying
the
death
on
the
high
seas
act
to
an
airplanes
act.
thus
this
court
will
not
have
to
overrule
any
of
its
decisions
or
any
make
break
in
its
established
law
if
it
comes
to
the
conclusion
that
airplane
accidents
at
least
of
the
sort
involved
here
do
not
come
within
admiralty
jurisdiction.
the
leading
case
to
the
contrary
is
the
weinstein
case,
a
careful
and
thoughtful
opinion
by
judge
biggs.
however,
it’s
perhaps
worthy
of
note
that
judge
van
dusen
was
the
trial
judge
in
that
case.
he
decided
to
the
contrary
and
judge
van
dusen
is
now
on
the
third
circuit
court
of
appeals.
indeed
there
was
a
certain
amount
of
what
layman
at
least
might
regard
as
lawyers
playing
games
in
the
whole
eastern
airlines
situation.
the
crash
occurred
in
massachusetts,
but
that
in
that
state
has
a
narrow
wrongful
death
statute
with
a
limit
on
recovery
fixed
to
$20,000.
so
the
suit
was
started
in
pennsylvania
where
there
is
no
such
limitation
and
the
court
of
appeals
held
there
was
admiralty
jurisdiction.
after
that
though,
counsel
apparently
gave
further
thought
and
feared
that
the
court
and
admiralty
might
find
that
the
massachusetts
statute
was
applicable
because
of
the
strength
of
these
place
of
the
tort
decisions.
and
so
suits
were
then
brought
on
the
law
side
of
the
pennsylvania
court
based
on
diversity
of
citizenship
which
was
easy
to
do,
because
you
can
appoint
a
nonresident
administrator.
and
the
suit
was
not
based
on
the
tort,
but
was
based
on
breach
of
a
contract
of
safe
carriage
as
to
which
it
was
held
at
the
pennsylvania
law
applied
and
this
is
what
was
sustained
by
the
court
of
appeals
and
they
forwarded
three
decisions
in
scott
against
the
eastern
airlines
company.
this
court
denied
certiorari
in
both
of
the
third
circuit
cases,
but
that
is
as
far
as
it
has
gone
on
this
problem.
why
should
not
admiralty
law
apply
to
all
torts
which
occur
or
indeed
come
to
rest
on
navigable
water?
one
may
as
well
ask
the
opposite
question,
why
should
admiralty
law
apply
to
all
such
torts
when
they
have
nothing
to
do
with
ships?
there
is
a
fundamental
difference
between
ships
and
airplanes,
apart
from
the
fact
that
ships
float
on
the
sea
and
airplanes
go
through
the
air.
this
is
that
ships
always
stay
on
the
water.
of
course
they
can
go
aground,
but
the
water
puts
them
there
and
they
can
be
put
and
dried
up,
but
it's
appropriately
even
held
that
since
they
float
there
that;
that’s
within
admiralty
jurisdiction.
the
sea
is
the
nourishing
source
for
a
ship,
but
an
airplane
is
based
on
the
ground.
it
flies
equally
well
over
land
as
oversea,
whether
it
ever
goes
over
the
sea
and
when
it
is
over
navigable
water
is
largely
fortuitous.
it
has
nothing
whatever
to
do
with
what
by
analogy
we
call
the
navigation
of
the
airplane.
now
let
us
take
the
case
of
a
plane
which
flies
from
new
york
to
san
francisco.
it
leaves
the
airport
and
circles
over
navigable
waters
as
it
picks
up
its
westward
course.
then
it
across
the
hudson
river,
a
navigable
water
way,
and
after
while
it
causes
the
ohio
river
and
then
the
mississippi
and
then
the
missouri.
in
due
course
it
crosses
the
upper
colorado
river
and
the
great
salt
lake,
both
of
which
have
been
held
by
this
court
to
be
navigable.
it
crosses
the
sacramento
river
and
then
comes
down
across
san
francisco
bay,
at
a
point
where
the
water
is
very
shallow.
perhaps
it
circles
over
the
pacific
ocean
before
coming
in
for
a
landing.
does
it
make
any
sense
to
say
that
tort
liability
is
the
matter
of
state
law,
except
in
the
cases
where
if
there
is
a
crash,
the
plane
chances
to
hit
a
water
way,
navigable
by
ships
with
in
the
state.
if
it
bounces
on
the
shore
and
comes
to
rest
in
the
mississippi
river,
which
is
essentially
what
it
did
here,
then
it's
a
matter
for
admiralty
jurisdiction.
despite
the
fact,
that
the
whole
venture
bears
no
relation
whatever
to
maritime
commerce.
yet
that
was
the
situation
in
the
eastern
airlines
case,
the
plane
can
be
rest
a
few
feet
in
the
water
in
boston
harbor
and
that's
the
case
here,
for
admiralty
jurisdiction
is
claimed
to
rest
on
the
place
where
the
plane
stopped
after
a
land
activity.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
that
would
be
the
converse
and
presumably
that
wouldn't
be
an
admiralty
if
it
stopped
on
dry
land.
the
problems
which
can
be
encountered,
if
one
takes
the
verbal
or
formal
view
that
admiralty
jurisdiction
extends
to
everything
that
happens
on
navigable
waters,
it
can
be
illustrated
by
a
number
of
decisions
in
the
lower
courts.
some
of
them
already
been
referred
here
and
they
orders
of
fall
off
of
bridges,
but
there
been
cases
on
this.
a
district
court
in
florida
has
held
that
a
suit
by
a
swimmer
who
was
struck
by
a
surfboard
is
within
admiralty
jurisdiction.
a
district
court
in
tennessee
is
held
that
an
injury
to
water
skier
is
with
in
admiralty
jurisdiction.
other
courts
have
gone
the
other
way.
a
district
court
in
new
york
is
held
that
a
women
who
was
injured
by
a
submerged
object
while
bathing
at
a
public
beach
cannot
maintain
a
suit
in
admiralty.
and
the
court
below
has
held
in
other
cases
that
a
swimmer
who
dove
from
a
municipal
dock
into
18
inches
of
water,
alleging
negligence
and
falling
to
construct
guard
rails
and
post
warning
signs
could
not
maintain
a
suit
in
admiralty,
and
in
other
case
where
the
decedent
fell
from
a
dock
and
was
drowned,
the
court
held
there
was
no
maritime
jurisdiction
and
finally
in
gowdy
against
the
united
states,
an
electrician
was
injured
while
repairing
the
machinery
inside
a
light
house
on
a
breakwater.
he
brought
a
libel
in
admiralty,
and
this
was
dismissed
because
the
injury
bore
no
relation
to
maritime
commerce
and
navigation.
this
court
denied
certiorari
in
both
two
of
these
sixth
circuit
cases
which
perhaps
even
score
from
the
two
denials
in
eastern
airline
case.
apparently,
the
earliest
case
involving
an
airplane
which
crashed
in
navigable
water
was
decided
in
1940,
nearly
60
years
ago.
that
was
crawford
bros.
no.
2
and
that's
the
name
of
an
airplane
not
of
the
ship.
that
was
the
libel
in
rem
for
repairs
to
an
airplane
which
fell
into
puget
sound
and
intervening
libellant
asserted
a
salvage
claim,
and
the
court
held
that
there
was
no
jurisdiction
in
admiralty,
saying
they
are
neither
on
the
land
nor
sea
and
not
being
of
the
sea
are
restricted
in
their
activities
to
navigable
waters,
they
are
not
maritime.
now,
reference
may
well
maybe
made
to
the
death
on
a
high
seas
act
which
was
enacted
in
1920,
the
text
of
which
appears
on
page
21
of
our
brief.
there
is
no
reference
in
that
statute
or
in
this
legislative
history
to
airplanes.
it
applies
--
it
is
a
lord
campbell's
act,
changing
the
common
laws,
so
as
to
provide
a
cause
of
action
for
wrongful
death
in
its
terms,
occurring
on
the
high
seas.
congress
made
the
death
on
the
high
seas
act
applicable
“on
the
high
seas
beyond
the
marine
league
from
the
shore
of
any
state,”
thus
indicating
rather
clearly,
it's
understanding
that
the
laws
of
the
states
were
applicable
in
territorial
waters,
which
is
what
we
have
here,
and
there
was
no
need
to
extend
admiralty
jurisdiction
to
them.
many
courts
have
held,
and
i
think
rightly,
that
the
death
on
the
high
seas
act
applies
to
airplane
accidents.
air
crashes
do
come
within
the
literal
language
of
the
statute
where
the
ultimate
impact
of
the
crash
is
on
the
high
seas.
it
is
true
that
congress
said
that
the
suit
under
the
death
on
the
high
seas
act
should
be
in
admiralty.
as
to
this
on
or
in
connection
with
ships,
this
is
of
course
clear,
and
within
traditional
admiralty
jurisdiction.
congress
was
not
thinking
of
airplane
accidents,
when
it
passed
this
statute.
there
was
no
need
for
it
to
extend
admiralty
jurisdiction
to
airplane
crashes
causing
death,
for
it
would
have
ample
power
to
provide
for
recovery
for
a
wrongful
death
in
air
accidents
under
its
power
to
regulate
interstate
and
foreign
commerce
and
not
to
mention
the
broad
powers
which
can
be
found
in
the
curtis
wright
decision
of
this
court.
when
the
statute
is
properly
extended
to
airplane
accidents,
it
may
well
be
that
it
should
not
be
constituted
to
mean
that
such
suits
are
actually
in
admiralty,
but
rather
the
congress
prescribes
that
the
recovery
though
at
law,
should
be
as
if
in
admiralty,
somewhat
as
the
state
law
was
applied
by
this
court
as
a
part
of
federal
law
in
the
marine
case
decided
a
year
or
so
ago.
that
is
with
the
measure
of
recovery
and
such
things
as
comparative
negligence
to
be
determined
by
the
standards
of
the
admiralty
rules.
as
long
as
the
law
stays
in
its
present
state,
we
will
have
innumerable
fruitless
borderline
problems,
such
as
this.
and
results
in
particular
cases
will
be
fortuitous
and
understandable
only
to
the
most
intricately
minded
lawyers.
there
will
be
disputes
as
to
where
tort
occurred,
the
doubts
about
the
question
that
mr
justice
stewart
asked
me,
and
whether
the
controlling
factor
is,
where
the
impact
occurred,
which
made
it
inevitable,
that
the
plane
would
crash,
or
whether
the
question
on
which
jurisdiction
turns
is
where
the
plane
came
to
rest.
as
i
see
it,
there
are
several
ways,
in
which
the
question
can
be
disposed
off.
at
first,
the
court
can
hold,
as
i
think
it
should,
that
airplane
crashes
having
no
connection
with
a
ship,
do
not
come
within
admiralty
jurisdiction.
as
i
have
said,
this
court
would
not
have
to
overrule
any
of
its
decisions
to
reach
such
a
result.
such
a
decision
would
be
in
accord
with
current
modern
british
law.
there
is
a
british
statute
which
provides
that
his
majesty
by
order
in
council
may
provide
the
court
and
the
rules
which
apply
to
airplanes
and
the
only
order
that
has
ever
been
issued
is
that
actions
by/or
against
an
airplane,
with
respect
to
salvage
pilotage
and
towage,
shall
be
in
admiralty,
but
nothing
else,
and
those
three
items
that
makes
a
certain
amount
of
sense
to
have
it
in
admiralty.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
have
--
my
position
on
this
is,
that
would
not
be
an
admiralty.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
that
would
not
be.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
ship
that
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
the
death
on
the
high
seas
act
would
apply,
because
congress
has
power
to
enact
it
under
the
interstate
and
foreign
commerce
power.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
that
is
the
position
which
i
am
seeking
to
advance
to
the
court
and
that's
the
one
which
seems
to
me
to
--
when
you
get
all
through
with
it
to
work
out
the
most
satisfactory.
i
can
think
of
no
reasons
why
there
should
be
as
airplane
are
not
ships.
when
the
admiralty
developed,
ships
had
no
power
of
their
own.
they
were
large
structures
floating
on
the
water,
subjected
to
the
vagaries
of
winds
and
tides
and
currents
and
always
subject
to
the
risk
of
collision,
no
matter
how
careful
the
master
or
the
pilot
might
be.
it
was
in
this
situation
that
the
rules
of
comparative
negligence
developed
in
admiralty.
no
one
contends
that
airplane
crew
members
are
entitled
to
maintenance
and
cure
or
that
they
are
wards
of
the
admiralty.
i
know
of
no
case
applying
the
admiralty
doctrine
of
general
average
to
an
airplane
nor
is
the
law
of
limitation
of
liability
applicable
to
them.
after
all,
an
airplane
after
it's
crashed
is
probably
as
worthless
in
water,
as
about
as
worthless
as
anything
can
be.
a
mortgage
on
an
airplane
is
not
a
maritime
contact
and
a
suit
on
such
a
security
interest
cannot
be
brought
in
admiralty.
having
gone
so
far
to
recognize
that
airplanes
are
not
ships,
and
they
are
not
within
admiralty
jurisdiction,
it
might
be
well
to
hold
that
they
are
not
within
admiralty
jurisdiction
for
tort
purposes.
thus,
eliminating
a
number
of
fruitless
line
drawing
problems,
if
airplanes
are
held
to
be
within
admiralty
for
some
purposes,
and
not
for
others.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes,
mr.
justice.
my
overall
argument
goes
beyond
the
brief.
i
have
allowed
the
processes
of
thought
to
take
effect.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
and
as
i
have
worked
on
this
case,
i
have
found
myself
less
willing
to
stand
on
that
ground
which
is
the
broad
ground
of
the
six
circuit,
and
as
it
became
more
clear
to
me
that
there
is
no
decision
of
this
court
as
to
be
overruled,
qualified,
the
court
has
never
dealt
with
the
problem.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no,
mr.
justice.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
because
the
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
and
congress
may
well
have
power
to
extend
it
to
admiralty.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
alright,
but
congress
didn't
have
the
slightest
idea
that
it
was
talking
about
airplanes
when
it
passed
that
statute.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
say
that
death
on
the
high
seas
act
applies,
because
congress
--
because
it
makes
sense
to
apply
it
under
all
the
circumstances
and
congress
has
power
to
enact
it
under
the
foreign
commerce
power,
even
though
it
may
not
have
had
power
to
do
it.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
my
basic
argument
is,
that's
not
presented
in
our
brief,
that
this
does
not
fall
within
the
admiralty
power.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
unless
perhaps
the
airplane
that's
a
ship,
which
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
sea
plane
is
another
matter.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no,
but
hydroplanes
is
another
matter.
if
this
were
done,
all
the
nip
picking
involved
in
this
case
would
be
eliminated.
if
the
crash
occurred
in
territorial
waters,
as
these
two
of
the
crash
here,
the
law
of
the
state
would
apply,
as
it
would
be
the
case
that
this
plane
had
ended
up
on
the
end
of
the
runway.
if
the
crash
occurred
on
the
high
seas,
the
state
courts
would
have
jurisdiction
or
the
federal
courts
might
have
jurisdiction
in
diversity
cases
or
congress
could
extend
jurisdiction
generally
to
the
federal
courts
since
interstate
or
foreign
commerce
is
necessarily
involved.
the
death
on
the
high
seas
act
would
be
applicable.
i
am
troubled
about
the
word
admiralty
in
the
statute.
if
there
was
a
nonfatal
crash,
or
if
there
was
a
suit
with
respect
to
loss
of
property,
the
courts
could
fashion
a
common
law
remedy
or
congress
could
legislate
if
that
was
thought
necessary.
now
my
time
has
expired,
but
my
second
alternative
would
be
to
say
that
this
case
only
involves
territorial
waters
and
at
least
as
far
as
territorial
waters
is
concerned,
it
is
not
admiralty.
as
to
the
international
flight
to
london,
the
court
could
either
hold
or
leave
open
the
question
whether
crash
is
outside
the
limits
of
any
state
or
within
admiralty
jurisdiction.
my
third
ground
would
be
essentially
that
of
the
six
circuit
court
of
appeals,
and
that
taken
in
our
brief
that
there
must
be
some
kind
of
a
maritime
nexus
which
we
contend
is
not
adequately
found,
merely
by
reason
of
the
fact
that
the
crash
comes
to
rest
in
the
navigable
waters.
and
finally
the
court
could
hold
that,
yes,
it
is
admiralty,
but
the
important
place
if
it
is
admiralty
is
where
the
impact
takes
place.
here
the
impact
was
over
the
sine
qua
non,
the
event
beyond
which
there
was
no
way
to
avoid
the
crash
occurred
over
a
land
than
it
was
on
that
ground
that
the
court
below
decided
the
case.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
court
is
confronted
here
with
something
in
a
sense
a
little
like
the
situation
presented
by
the
genesee
chief,
where
the
court
extended
admiralty
to
the
inland
waters.
here
we
have
a
new
means
of
transportation,
we
have
two
generations
of
experience
with
it.
nothing
has
indicated
any
reason
why
it
is
useful
or
desirable
or
necessary
to
have
it
in
admiralty
and
the
court
might
well
provide,
might
well
decide
that
neither
within
the
history
nor
the
proper
scope
of
admiralty,
should
airplane
accidents
of
this
sort
be
held
to
be
within
admiralty
jurisdiction.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
think
that
this
is
the
first
time
that
i
have
ever
been
a
proctor
in
admiralty
to
which
i
was
admitted
some
years
ago.
let
me
start
by
restating
the
facts
of
the
case
which
are
illustrated
by
this
chart.
here
is
in
the
brief
for
the
city
of
cleveland
and
is
plaintiffs
exhibit
4
in
the
case.
north
is
to
the
right
which
is
perhaps
a
little
misleading,
but
if
i
took
the
chart
to
side
and
the
lettering
is
hard
to
read,
the
plane
started
here
at
the
runway
at
the
gate,
came
to
the
end
of
the
sixth
left
runway
and
started
down
the
runway
to
the
north-east.
at
this
place,
where
it
says
‘rotate
area’,
that
is
airplane
language
for
takeoff.
what
you
do
is
rotate
the
nose
of
the
plane
and
the
takeoff
was
between
2,800
and
3,000
feet
down
the
runway.
the
bird
area
was
between
3,600
feet
and
6,200
feet.
but
before
the
plane
had
left
the
end
of
the
runway,
the
control
tower
had
said,
“caution,
birds
on
end
of
runway,”
and
that
appears
on
page
14
of
the
record
and
then
had
added,
“it
looks
like
there
are
a
million
of
them.”
now,
the
plane
started
down,
nevertheless,
and
took
off
at
2,800
feet.
when
it
took
off
the
bird
flushed
into
the
air.
the
plane
hit
the
birds
in
this
area
over
land,
as
mr.
bostwick
has
said,
314
dead
birds
were
found
on
the
runway
on
land
and
the
engines
of
the
plane
were
filled
with
ingested
birds.
the
plane
immediately
lost
power,
the
pilot
endeavored
to
take
what
steps
he
could
to
get
out
of
the
situation.
he
hit
the
perimeter
fence
of
the
airport
here
and
a
truck
which
was
parked
at
the
end
of
the
airport
and
this
statement
on
the
exhibit
e.
mca
is
mr.
mcavoy's
initial
which
he
put
on
the
exhibit
to
indicate
that
is
the
point
where
the
truck
was
hit,
all
of
this
of
this
of
course
is
on
land.
by
this
time,
the
plane
is
almost
hopelessly
disabled
and
it
was
a
miracle
that
it
finally
came
through
and
the
three
persons
on
board
came
out.
these
dotted
lines
are
the
course
of
the
plane
after
hitting
the
truck,
they
too
were
put
on
the
exhibit
as
the
testimony
of
mr.
mcavoy.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
mr.
mcavoy
is
a
witness
for
the
plaintiff.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
and
the
plane
finally
came
to
the
rest
--
to
rest
in
the
water
here
and
this
e.
mca
9
is
mr.
mcavoy's
testimony
that
represents
the
place
where
it
came
to
rest.
i
may
point
out
that
this
is
the
cleveland
breakwater
here,
all
of
this
is
inside
the
breakwater,
that
doesn't
mean
that
it
is
not
navigable
water,
but
it
is
not
the
high
sea
on
the
lake,
so
to
speak.
now
there
is
a
reference
in
the
briefs
to
the
fact
that
the
plane
came
to
rest
a
fifth
of
a
mile
from
the
under
the
runway.
that
is
literally
true,
this
being
the
end
the
runaway
and
it's
a
fifth
of
a
miles
there,
but
it
was
only
30
or
40
feet
from
land
to
the
north
that
the
plane
came
to
rest.
it's
clear
that
the
damage
to
the
engines
was
done
and
completed
before
the
plane
hit
the
water.
it
is
also
clear
that
there
was
substantial
damage
to
the
airframe
from
hitting
the
fence
and
the
truck
and
the
birds,
before
the
plane
hit
the
water.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
the
aircraft
was
here
at
the
end
of
the
runway
--
at
the
beginning
of
the
runway
before
takeoff.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
am
sorry,
sir.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
the
aircraft
had
not
started
into
the
air
at
the
time
of
warning
was
given.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
the
flight
need
not
have
started
at
all.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes,
the
tower
could
have
instructed
them
not
to
go
off.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
after
you
have
given
the
pilot,
the
information
there
is
a
quite
a
bit
of
a
practice
in
the
air
industry
that
the
decision
is
up
to
the
pilot,
not
to
the
controller
tower.
this
has
not
been
tried
in
this
case.
i
suppose,
this
bears
on
the
question
of
comparative
negligence
which
might
be
relevant
in
admiralty
and
the
contributory
negligence
which
would
be
relevant,
if
it
is
not
in
admiralty.
now
the
district
court
in
this
case,
dismiss
the
libel
in
admiralty.
it
found
that
it
is
manifest
that
the
alleged
negligence
became
operative
upon
the
aircraft,
the
pilot
was
over
the
land
and
it
added
whether
it
came
down
upon
land
or
upon
water,
was
largely
fortuitous,
and
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed
on
the
ground
that
the
tort
occurred
on
land.
it's
said
in
its
opinion
that
the
alleged
tort
occurred
on
land,
even
though
the
plane
fell
into
the
navigable
water
shortly
after
take
off
from
the
airport
and
that
no
right
of
action
is
cognizable
in
admiralty.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
number
three
is
hitting
the
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
perhaps,
yes,
that
is
perfectly
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
don’t
know
mr.
justice.
i
suppose
that’s
a
part
of
the
issue
in
this
case.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
there
are
two
defendants
here.
one,
the
city
of
cleveland
who
mr.
crocker
represents
and
the
other
the
tower
controller
and
employee
of
the
federal
government
whom
i
represent.
mr.
crocker
has
generously
given
all
of
the
time
to
me,
but
i
am
in
a
very
real
sense
representing
the
city
of
cleveland
as
well
as
the
airport
controller,
and
mr.
crocker
relies
more
heavily
on
this
question
of
where
was
the
tort
than
i
do
and
i
am
sure
that
the
court
will
give
careful
consideration
to
his
brief.
this
was
the
ground
upon
which
the
six
circuit
court
of
appeals
decided
the
case
and
it
relied
primarily
on
three
decisions.
now
i
know
it
is
perfectly
easy
to
go
through
this
court's
admiralty
cases
over
100
years
and
find
a
case
such
as
the
one
mr.
bostwick
referred
to,
the
plaintiff,
which
rather
refers
to
the
consequences
rather
than
to
the
point
of
impact.
the
three
cases
which
the
six
circuit
relied
on,
smith
&
son
against
taylor,
minnie
against
port
huron
terminal
company
and
finally
the
admiral
peoples
are
all
cases
in
which
the
court
made
the
decision
between
admiralty
and
non-admiralty
turn
on
the
point
of
injury
in
the
sense
of
point
of
impact.
in
smith
&
son
against
taylor
a
longshoreman
was
standing
on
a
stage
which
rested
on
a
port
and
projected
a
few
feet
over
the
water.
he
was
struck
by
a
sling
loaded
with
cargo
which
was
being
lowered
over
the
side
from
the
ship
and
not
into
the
water.
and
the
court
held
that
was
the
–
in
--
the
tort
was
on
land
and
not
in
sea
and
that
there
could
be
no
maritime
recovery.
the
next
case
minnie
against
port
huron
terminal
company
is
almost
exactly
the
converse
and
the
admiral
peoples
is
a
gangplank
case.
there
is
slip
and
fall.
he
slipped
and
fell
on
the
gangplank
and
hit
the
port
and
that
was
held
to
be
a
ship
injury,
because
the
slip
and
fall
was
on
the
gangplank.
now
the
only
case
that
really
deals
with
this
kind
of
accident
is
the
third
circuit's
decision
in
weinstein
against
eastern
airlines
and
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
though
decision
is
certainly
doctrinally
inconsistent
with
the
six
circuit,
there
are
no
facts
appeared
in
that
case
which
are
anything
like
the
facts
which
have
been
shown
here
with
respect
to
the
injuries
on
and
over
land.
for
the
weinstein
case
arose
on
a
motion
to
dismiss
and
the
libel
said
that
shortly
after
the
aircraft
had
become
airborne
by
reason
of
the
negligence
of
the
respondents
and
by
virtue
of
their
respective
breach
of
warranties,
said
aircraft
crashed
into
the
navigable
waters
of
boston
harbor.
and
that
is
all
the
allegation
there
is.
there
is
no
allegation
there
that
anything
happened
on
or
above
the
land
and
the
issue
arose
on
the
exceptions
of
the
eastern
airlines,
the
facts
averred
in
the
libel
do
not
constitute
a
cause
of
action
against
eastern
airlines
inc.
within
the
admiralty
jurisdiction
of
this
court.
i
would
like
to
devote
the
--
i
think
the
factual
situation
is
clear
to
the
court
and
the
basis
of
the
decision
below
appeared
clearly
in
its
opinion
and
we
rely
on
that.
but
i
would
like
to
devote
the
rest
of
my
argument
to
the
broader
question,
should
admiralty
law
apply
to
an
airplane
crash
of
this
sort?
by
that
i
am
not
weaving
the
place
of
the
tort
argument,
i
am
seeking
to
present
a
broader
ground.
the
only
reason
that
i
can
think
of
for
bringing
this
within
admiralty
is
a
purely
verbal
one,
namely
that
admiralty
applies
to
the
sea
or
in
this
country
to
in
the
navigable
waters
and
this
plane
landed
in
the
water
ergo,
admiralty
jurisdiction.
but
even
on
a
verbal
basis
if
we
start
by
saying
that
admiralty
relates
to
ships,
then
this
case
does
not
involve
a
ship
and
ergo,
no
admiralty
jurisdiction.
obviously,
both
of
these
approaches
are
essentially
formal,
i
am
not
suggesting
at
all,
of
course,
that
admiralty
must
be
confined
to
exactly
what
it
covered
in
1787
or
1789.
obviously,
the
constitution
should
be
construed
so
as
to
accommodate
new
developments.
admiralty
took
in
steamships
when
they
came
and
admiralty
was
rightly
extended
to
the
in
the
navigable
waters
of
the
united
states
which
were
something
not
paralleled
in
britain.
similarly,
the
constitution
gives
congress
power
with
respect
to
an
army
and
a
navy
and
no
one
questions
that,
that
applies
also
to
an
air
force.
but
it
does
not
follow
that
admiralty
should
extend
to
every
tort
which
occurs
on
water,
if
this
tort
did
occur
on
water
and
specifically
it
does
not
follow
that
admiralty
jurisdiction
should
be
found
to
extend
to
airplane
accidents
of
the
sort
involved
here.
there
is
no
decision
of
this
court
saying
that
any
sort
of
airplane
accident
is
within
admiralty
jurisdiction.
there
are
not
even
any
decisions
of
this
court
applying
the
death
on
the
high
seas
act
to
an
airplanes
act.
thus
this
court
will
not
have
to
overrule
any
of
its
decisions
or
any
make
break
in
its
established
law
if
it
comes
to
the
conclusion
that
airplane
accidents
at
least
of
the
sort
involved
here
do
not
come
within
admiralty
jurisdiction.
the
leading
case
to
the
contrary
is
the
weinstein
case,
a
careful
and
thoughtful
opinion
by
judge
biggs.
however,
it’s
perhaps
worthy
of
note
that
judge
van
dusen
was
the
trial
judge
in
that
case.
he
decided
to
the
contrary
and
judge
van
dusen
is
now
on
the
third
circuit
court
of
appeals.
indeed
there
was
a
certain
amount
of
what
layman
at
least
might
regard
as
lawyers
playing
games
in
the
whole
eastern
airlines
situation.
the
crash
occurred
in
massachusetts,
but
that
in
that
state
has
a
narrow
wrongful
death
statute
with
a
limit
on
recovery
fixed
to
$20,000.
so
the
suit
was
started
in
pennsylvania
where
there
is
no
such
limitation
and
the
court
of
appeals
held
there
was
admiralty
jurisdiction.
after
that
though,
counsel
apparently
gave
further
thought
and
feared
that
the
court
and
admiralty
might
find
that
the
massachusetts
statute
was
applicable
because
of
the
strength
of
these
place
of
the
tort
decisions.
and
so
suits
were
then
brought
on
the
law
side
of
the
pennsylvania
court
based
on
diversity
of
citizenship
which
was
easy
to
do,
because
you
can
appoint
a
nonresident
administrator.
and
the
suit
was
not
based
on
the
tort,
but
was
based
on
breach
of
a
contract
of
safe
carriage
as
to
which
it
was
held
at
the
pennsylvania
law
applied
and
this
is
what
was
sustained
by
the
court
of
appeals
and
they
forwarded
three
decisions
in
scott
against
the
eastern
airlines
company.
this
court
denied
certiorari
in
both
of
the
third
circuit
cases,
but
that
is
as
far
as
it
has
gone
on
this
problem.
why
should
not
admiralty
law
apply
to
all
torts
which
occur
or
indeed
come
to
rest
on
navigable
water?
one
may
as
well
ask
the
opposite
question,
why
should
admiralty
law
apply
to
all
such
torts
when
they
have
nothing
to
do
with
ships?
there
is
a
fundamental
difference
between
ships
and
airplanes,
apart
from
the
fact
that
ships
float
on
the
sea
and
airplanes
go
through
the
air.
this
is
that
ships
always
stay
on
the
water.
of
course
they
can
go
aground,
but
the
water
puts
them
there
and
they
can
be
put
and
dried
up,
but
it's
appropriately
even
held
that
since
they
float
there
that;
that’s
within
admiralty
jurisdiction.
the
sea
is
the
nourishing
source
for
a
ship,
but
an
airplane
is
based
on
the
ground.
it
flies
equally
well
over
land
as
oversea,
whether
it
ever
goes
over
the
sea
and
when
it
is
over
navigable
water
is
largely
fortuitous.
it
has
nothing
whatever
to
do
with
what
by
analogy
we
call
the
navigation
of
the
airplane.
now
let
us
take
the
case
of
a
plane
which
flies
from
new
york
to
san
francisco.
it
leaves
the
airport
and
circles
over
navigable
waters
as
it
picks
up
its
westward
course.
then
it
across
the
hudson
river,
a
navigable
water
way,
and
after
while
it
causes
the
ohio
river
and
then
the
mississippi
and
then
the
missouri.
in
due
course
it
crosses
the
upper
colorado
river
and
the
great
salt
lake,
both
of
which
have
been
held
by
this
court
to
be
navigable.
it
crosses
the
sacramento
river
and
then
comes
down
across
san
francisco
bay,
at
a
point
where
the
water
is
very
shallow.
perhaps
it
circles
over
the
pacific
ocean
before
coming
in
for
a
landing.
does
it
make
any
sense
to
say
that
tort
liability
is
the
matter
of
state
law,
except
in
the
cases
where
if
there
is
a
crash,
the
plane
chances
to
hit
a
water
way,
navigable
by
ships
with
in
the
state.
if
it
bounces
on
the
shore
and
comes
to
rest
in
the
mississippi
river,
which
is
essentially
what
it
did
here,
then
it's
a
matter
for
admiralty
jurisdiction.
despite
the
fact,
that
the
whole
venture
bears
no
relation
whatever
to
maritime
commerce.
yet
that
was
the
situation
in
the
eastern
airlines
case,
the
plane
can
be
rest
a
few
feet
in
the
water
in
boston
harbor
and
that's
the
case
here,
for
admiralty
jurisdiction
is
claimed
to
rest
on
the
place
where
the
plane
stopped
after
a
land
activity.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
that
would
be
the
converse
and
presumably
that
wouldn't
be
an
admiralty
if
it
stopped
on
dry
land.
the
problems
which
can
be
encountered,
if
one
takes
the
verbal
or
formal
view
that
admiralty
jurisdiction
extends
to
everything
that
happens
on
navigable
waters,
it
can
be
illustrated
by
a
number
of
decisions
in
the
lower
courts.
some
of
them
already
been
referred
here
and
they
orders
of
fall
off
of
bridges,
but
there
been
cases
on
this.
a
district
court
in
florida
has
held
that
a
suit
by
a
swimmer
who
was
struck
by
a
surfboard
is
within
admiralty
jurisdiction.
a
district
court
in
tennessee
is
held
that
an
injury
to
water
skier
is
with
in
admiralty
jurisdiction.
other
courts
have
gone
the
other
way.
a
district
court
in
new
york
is
held
that
a
women
who
was
injured
by
a
submerged
object
while
bathing
at
a
public
beach
cannot
maintain
a
suit
in
admiralty.
and
the
court
below
has
held
in
other
cases
that
a
swimmer
who
dove
from
a
municipal
dock
into
18
inches
of
water,
alleging
negligence
and
falling
to
construct
guard
rails
and
post
warning
signs
could
not
maintain
a
suit
in
admiralty,
and
in
other
case
where
the
decedent
fell
from
a
dock
and
was
drowned,
the
court
held
there
was
no
maritime
jurisdiction
and
finally
in
gowdy
against
the
united
states,
an
electrician
was
injured
while
repairing
the
machinery
inside
a
light
house
on
a
breakwater.
he
brought
a
libel
in
admiralty,
and
this
was
dismissed
because
the
injury
bore
no
relation
to
maritime
commerce
and
navigation.
this
court
denied
certiorari
in
both
two
of
these
sixth
circuit
cases
which
perhaps
even
score
from
the
two
denials
in
eastern
airline
case.
apparently,
the
earliest
case
involving
an
airplane
which
crashed
in
navigable
water
was
decided
in
1940,
nearly
60
years
ago.
that
was
crawford
bros.
no.
2
and
that's
the
name
of
an
airplane
not
of
the
ship.
that
was
the
libel
in
rem
for
repairs
to
an
airplane
which
fell
into
puget
sound
and
intervening
libellant
asserted
a
salvage
claim,
and
the
court
held
that
there
was
no
jurisdiction
in
admiralty,
saying
they
are
neither
on
the
land
nor
sea
and
not
being
of
the
sea
are
restricted
in
their
activities
to
navigable
waters,
they
are
not
maritime.
now,
reference
may
well
maybe
made
to
the
death
on
a
high
seas
act
which
was
enacted
in
1920,
the
text
of
which
appears
on
page
21
of
our
brief.
there
is
no
reference
in
that
statute
or
in
this
legislative
history
to
airplanes.
it
applies
--
it
is
a
lord
campbell's
act,
changing
the
common
laws,
so
as
to
provide
a
cause
of
action
for
wrongful
death
in
its
terms,
occurring
on
the
high
seas.
congress
made
the
death
on
the
high
seas
act
applicable
“on
the
high
seas
beyond
the
marine
league
from
the
shore
of
any
state,”
thus
indicating
rather
clearly,
it's
understanding
that
the
laws
of
the
states
were
applicable
in
territorial
waters,
which
is
what
we
have
here,
and
there
was
no
need
to
extend
admiralty
jurisdiction
to
them.
many
courts
have
held,
and
i
think
rightly,
that
the
death
on
the
high
seas
act
applies
to
airplane
accidents.
air
crashes
do
come
within
the
literal
language
of
the
statute
where
the
ultimate
impact
of
the
crash
is
on
the
high
seas.
it
is
true
that
congress
said
that
the
suit
under
the
death
on
the
high
seas
act
should
be
in
admiralty.
as
to
this
on
or
in
connection
with
ships,
this
is
of
course
clear,
and
within
traditional
admiralty
jurisdiction.
congress
was
not
thinking
of
airplane
accidents,
when
it
passed
this
statute.
there
was
no
need
for
it
to
extend
admiralty
jurisdiction
to
airplane
crashes
causing
death,
for
it
would
have
ample
power
to
provide
for
recovery
for
a
wrongful
death
in
air
accidents
under
its
power
to
regulate
interstate
and
foreign
commerce
and
not
to
mention
the
broad
powers
which
can
be
found
in
the
curtis
wright
decision
of
this
court.
when
the
statute
is
properly
extended
to
airplane
accidents,
it
may
well
be
that
it
should
not
be
constituted
to
mean
that
such
suits
are
actually
in
admiralty,
but
rather
the
congress
prescribes
that
the
recovery
though
at
law,
should
be
as
if
in
admiralty,
somewhat
as
the
state
law
was
applied
by
this
court
as
a
part
of
federal
law
in
the
marine
case
decided
a
year
or
so
ago.
that
is
with
the
measure
of
recovery
and
such
things
as
comparative
negligence
to
be
determined
by
the
standards
of
the
admiralty
rules.
as
long
as
the
law
stays
in
its
present
state,
we
will
have
innumerable
fruitless
borderline
problems,
such
as
this.
and
results
in
particular
cases
will
be
fortuitous
and
understandable
only
to
the
most
intricately
minded
lawyers.
there
will
be
disputes
as
to
where
tort
occurred,
the
doubts
about
the
question
that
mr
justice
stewart
asked
me,
and
whether
the
controlling
factor
is,
where
the
impact
occurred,
which
made
it
inevitable,
that
the
plane
would
crash,
or
whether
the
question
on
which
jurisdiction
turns
is
where
the
plane
came
to
rest.
as
i
see
it,
there
are
several
ways,
in
which
the
question
can
be
disposed
off.
at
first,
the
court
can
hold,
as
i
think
it
should,
that
airplane
crashes
having
no
connection
with
a
ship,
do
not
come
within
admiralty
jurisdiction.
as
i
have
said,
this
court
would
not
have
to
overrule
any
of
its
decisions
to
reach
such
a
result.
such
a
decision
would
be
in
accord
with
current
modern
british
law.
there
is
a
british
statute
which
provides
that
his
majesty
by
order
in
council
may
provide
the
court
and
the
rules
which
apply
to
airplanes
and
the
only
order
that
has
ever
been
issued
is
that
actions
by/or
against
an
airplane,
with
respect
to
salvage
pilotage
and
towage,
shall
be
in
admiralty,
but
nothing
else,
and
those
three
items
that
makes
a
certain
amount
of
sense
to
have
it
in
admiralty.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
have
--
my
position
on
this
is,
that
would
not
be
an
admiralty.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
that
would
not
be.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
ship
that
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
the
death
on
the
high
seas
act
would
apply,
because
congress
has
power
to
enact
it
under
the
interstate
and
foreign
commerce
power.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
that
is
the
position
which
i
am
seeking
to
advance
to
the
court
and
that's
the
one
which
seems
to
me
to
--
when
you
get
all
through
with
it
to
work
out
the
most
satisfactory.
i
can
think
of
no
reasons
why
there
should
be
as
airplane
are
not
ships.
when
the
admiralty
developed,
ships
had
no
power
of
their
own.
they
were
large
structures
floating
on
the
water,
subjected
to
the
vagaries
of
winds
and
tides
and
currents
and
always
subject
to
the
risk
of
collision,
no
matter
how
careful
the
master
or
the
pilot
might
be.
it
was
in
this
situation
that
the
rules
of
comparative
negligence
developed
in
admiralty.
no
one
contends
that
airplane
crew
members
are
entitled
to
maintenance
and
cure
or
that
they
are
wards
of
the
admiralty.
i
know
of
no
case
applying
the
admiralty
doctrine
of
general
average
to
an
airplane
nor
is
the
law
of
limitation
of
liability
applicable
to
them.
after
all,
an
airplane
after
it's
crashed
is
probably
as
worthless
in
water,
as
about
as
worthless
as
anything
can
be.
a
mortgage
on
an
airplane
is
not
a
maritime
contact
and
a
suit
on
such
a
security
interest
cannot
be
brought
in
admiralty.
having
gone
so
far
to
recognize
that
airplanes
are
not
ships,
and
they
are
not
within
admiralty
jurisdiction,
it
might
be
well
to
hold
that
they
are
not
within
admiralty
jurisdiction
for
tort
purposes.
thus,
eliminating
a
number
of
fruitless
line
drawing
problems,
if
airplanes
are
held
to
be
within
admiralty
for
some
purposes,
and
not
for
others.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes,
mr.
justice.
my
overall
argument
goes
beyond
the
brief.
i
have
allowed
the
processes
of
thought
to
take
effect.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
and
as
i
have
worked
on
this
case,
i
have
found
myself
less
willing
to
stand
on
that
ground
which
is
the
broad
ground
of
the
six
circuit,
and
as
it
became
more
clear
to
me
that
there
is
no
decision
of
this
court
as
to
be
overruled,
qualified,
the
court
has
never
dealt
with
the
problem.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no,
mr.
justice.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
because
the
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
and
congress
may
well
have
power
to
extend
it
to
admiralty.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
alright,
but
congress
didn't
have
the
slightest
idea
that
it
was
talking
about
airplanes
when
it
passed
that
statute.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
say
that
death
on
the
high
seas
act
applies,
because
congress
--
because
it
makes
sense
to
apply
it
under
all
the
circumstances
and
congress
has
power
to
enact
it
under
the
foreign
commerce
power,
even
though
it
may
not
have
had
power
to
do
it.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
my
basic
argument
is,
that's
not
presented
in
our
brief,
that
this
does
not
fall
within
the
admiralty
power.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
unless
perhaps
the
airplane
that's
a
ship,
which
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
sea
plane
is
another
matter.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no,
but
hydroplanes
is
another
matter.
if
this
were
done,
all
the
nip
picking
involved
in
this
case
would
be
eliminated.
if
the
crash
occurred
in
territorial
waters,
as
these
two
of
the
crash
here,
the
law
of
the
state
would
apply,
as
it
would
be
the
case
that
this
plane
had
ended
up
on
the
end
of
the
runway.
if
the
crash
occurred
on
the
high
seas,
the
state
courts
would
have
jurisdiction
or
the
federal
courts
might
have
jurisdiction
in
diversity
cases
or
congress
could
extend
jurisdiction
generally
to
the
federal
courts
since
interstate
or
foreign
commerce
is
necessarily
involved.
the
death
on
the
high
seas
act
would
be
applicable.
i
am
troubled
about
the
word
admiralty
in
the
statute.
if
there
was
a
nonfatal
crash,
or
if
there
was
a
suit
with
respect
to
loss
of
property,
the
courts
could
fashion
a
common
law
remedy
or
congress
could
legislate
if
that
was
thought
necessary.
now
my
time
has
expired,
but
my
second
alternative
would
be
to
say
that
this
case
only
involves
territorial
waters
and
at
least
as
far
as
territorial
waters
is
concerned,
it
is
not
admiralty.
as
to
the
international
flight
to
london,
the
court
could
either
hold
or
leave
open
the
question
whether
crash
is
outside
the
limits
of
any
state
or
within
admiralty
jurisdiction.
my
third
ground
would
be
essentially
that
of
the
six
circuit
court
of
appeals,
and
that
taken
in
our
brief
that
there
must
be
some
kind
of
a
maritime
nexus
which
we
contend
is
not
adequately
found,
merely
by
reason
of
the
fact
that
the
crash
comes
to
rest
in
the
navigable
waters.
and
finally
the
court
could
hold
that,
yes,
it
is
admiralty,
but
the
important
place
if
it
is
admiralty
is
where
the
impact
takes
place.
here
the
impact
was
over
the
sine
qua
non,
the
event
beyond
which
there
was
no
way
to
avoid
the
crash
occurred
over
a
land
than
it
was
on
that
ground
that
the
court
below
decided
the
case.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
court
is
confronted
here
with
something
in
a
sense
a
little
like
the
situation
presented
by
the
genesee
chief,
where
the
court
extended
admiralty
to
the
inland
waters.
here
we
have
a
new
means
of
transportation,
we
have
two
generations
of
experience
with
it.
nothing
has
indicated
any
reason
why
it
is
useful
or
desirable
or
necessary
to
have
it
in
admiralty
and
the
court
might
well
provide,
might
well
decide
that
neither
within
the
history
nor
the
proper
scope
of
admiralty,
should
airplane
accidents
of
this
sort
be
held
to
be
within
admiralty
jurisdiction.
