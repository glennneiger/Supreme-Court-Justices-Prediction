what
do
you
--
what
do
you
understand
them
to
be
meaning
when
they
say
tort
occurred
on
land?
as
i
understand
it
that
of
these
three
events
here,
two
occurred
on
land
and
one
on
water.
one
is
the
alleged
negligence
i.e.
the
failure
to
tell
him
not
to
take
off,
that
was
obviously
on
land.
number
two
was
the
inflection
of
the
initial
damage
by
the
birds
and
by
fence
and
so
on
and
that
occurred
on
land.
and
only
the
third
occurred
on
water
which
was
the
eventual
loss
of
the
airplane.
well,
were
they
are
talking
about
number
one
and
number
