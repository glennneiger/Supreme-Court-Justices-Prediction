justice
william
h.
rehnquist
let
me
interrupt
you
if
i
may
mr.
bostwick.
what
would
logically
follow
from
that
sort
of
a
holding
other
than
just
the
law
governing
that
crash.
would
you
ever
doctrine
of
unseaworthiness
or
unairworthiness
on
airplanes
where
if
say
a
crew
member
slipped
without
there
ever
being
a
crash
that
happened
over
water
and
you
would
have
a
claim
under
the
sea
shipping
versus
sieracki
and
that
sort
of
case?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
what
if
we
do
not
have
a
crash
at
all?
supposing
just
while
the
plane
is
navigating
over
the
biscayne
bay
coming
into
miami,
some
crew
member
slips
and
falls,
nothing
ever
happens
to
plane
except
that
it
lands
at
miami,
but
if
that
slip
and
fall
occurs
over
navigable
water,
does
that
mean
that
it's
an
admiralty
type
of
injury?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
it's
true
of
the
automobiles
too.
i
mean
the
guy
can
drown,
if
he
drives
off
a
bridge
into
navigable
water?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
justice
brennan
asked
you
what
is
a
plus
here
and
as
i
understand
your
answer,
it's
because
the
aircraft
went
down
in
navigable
water,
the
people
in
the
aircraft
confront
basically
the
same
problem
the
people
going
down
in
the
ship
confront
and
i
wish
to
add
the
comment
that
i
don't
think
either
of
those
problems
are
distinguished
between
the
people
who
are
in
a
car
about
to
drown
in
navigable
water.
if
there
is
going
to
be
a
plus
that
separates
aircraft
and
automobiles,
there
is
got
to
be
some
other
than
what
you
have
said?
