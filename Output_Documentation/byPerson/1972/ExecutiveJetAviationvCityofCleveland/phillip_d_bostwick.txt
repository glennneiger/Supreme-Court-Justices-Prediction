mr.
phillip
d.
bostwick
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
on
certiorari
to
sixth
circuit
calls
upon
this
court
to
resolve
any
records
out
of
the
conflict
between
the
third
circuit
in
an
opinion
of
the
court
below.
the
issue
presented
is
whether
the
federal
courts
have
maritime
jurisdiction
over
airplane
crashes
in
navigable
waters
where
the
tortuous
conduct
is
alleged
to
have
occurred
on
land.
the
facts
in
this
case
are
under
perjury
undisputed.
the
petitioners
are
the
owner
and
operator
of
a
corporate
twin-engine
jet
aircraft,
known
as
the
falcon.
they
and
their
aircraft
prepared
to
takeoff
from
burke
lakefront
airport
at
cleveland,
ohio
on
july
of
1968.
burke
lakefront
is
owned
and
operated
by
the
respondent
city
of
cleveland,
ohio
and
is
built
on
a
fill
and
the
navigable
waters
of
lake
erie.
on
the
day
in
question,
the
aircraft
was
piloted
by
two
pilots
and
had
a
crew
of
one
stewardess
and
was
prepared
to
takeoff
to
pick
up
passengers
in
maine.
there
is
some
question
in
the
record
as
to
the
clearance
given
to
the
pilots
before
takeoff.
it
our
position
that
the
questions
of
tributary
negligence
not
being
before
this
court,
those
matters
are
irrelevant,
however
they
have
been
raised
in
the
respondent's
briefs.
in
any
event
there
is
no
question
about
the
fact
that
the
pilots
did
see
--
could
not
see
the
other
end
of
the
runway
before
takeoff,
could
not
see
that
the
last
third
of
the
runway
was
covered
by
a
flock
of
seagulls
and
did
receive
a
clearance
for
takeoff
from
the
air
traffic
controllers
in
the
tower,
from
respondent
dicken
who
is
employed
by
the
united
states
government.
the
aircraft
took
off.
shortly
after
liftoff,
the
pilots
noticed
for
the
first
time
the
sea
of
seagulls.
as
the
plane
approached
the
seagulls,
the
flock
rose,
the
aircraft
struck
many
of
the
birds,
314
of
the
seagulls
were
found
on
the
runway
alone.
thereafter,
birds
were
ingested
into
the
engines
of
the
jet,
the
engines
flamed
out
and
the
pilot
prepared
for
a
ditching.
he
raised
the
landing
gear
and
prepared
for
a
crash
landing.
on
the
way
down,
the
aircraft
landing
gear
did
strike
the
top
of
a
pickup
truck
parked
near
the
airport
perimeter
fence
and
broke
the
barbwire
of
the
perimeter
fence.
and
there
is
an
appendix
of
photographs
to
this
case
which
shows
the
damage
done
to
the
vehicle
and
the
fence,
birds
on
the
runway
for
the
whatever
use
it
maybe
to
the
court.
in
any
event
the
aircraft
continued
in
flight
and
impacted
in
the
navigable
waters
of
lake
erie.
when
airborne
again,
it
impacted
a
second
time
where
it
sank
in
what
has
been
undisputed
navigable
waters,
something
in
depth
of
an
excess
of
45
feet.
there
is
also
a
photograph,
i
believe
it's
photograph
three
showing
an
x
out
in
the
lake
when
the
aircraft
submerged
the
pilots
and
stewardess
miraculously
were
not
injured
or
killed.
they
exited
from
the
aircraft
and
a
small
craft
picked
them
up.
the
coastguard
came,
there
was
an
effort
made
to
put
a
line
around
the
aircraft
and
pull
it
towards
shore
and
the
place
where
they
succeeded
in
dragging
it
is
the
second
x
on
the
photograph.
mr.
phillip
d.
bostwick
it
was
a
jet,
yes
sir.
it
was
a
corporate
jet,
a
small
falcon
jet
owned
by
executive
jet
aviation
and
used
for
purposes
of
transporting
business
and
other
persons?
mr.
phillip

bostwick
the
crew
were
deadheading
if
the
court
pleased
to
pick
up
some
revenue
paying
passengers
at
another
airport.
it
had
been
positioned
at
burke
lakefront
airport.
the
aircraft
was
salvaged
after
remaining
submerged
in
the
lake
for
two
days.
skin
divers
were
used,
a
contract
barge
was
used
and
the
aircraft
was
raised.
it
was
dropped
back
into
the
lake
during
raising
and
additional
damage
was
done.
in
any
event
when
it
had
been
retrieved
from
the
lake,
after
over
two
days,
the
extensive
water
soaking
to
the
expensive
avionics
navigation
and
equipment
and
instruments,
and
to
the
interior
of
the
aircraft,
the
impact
damage
which
had
been
done
to
the
fuselage
of
the
aircraft
by
the
two
impacts
at
the
lake
caused
the
aircraft
to
be
a
total
loss.
and
there
is
no
dispute
in
this
case
of
two
facts;
one
that
the
aircraft
did
crash
in
navigable
waters
of
lake
erie
and
two
that
as
a
result
of
that
crash
in
the
lake
the
aircraft
was
totally
destroyed.
two
actions
were
brought
by
the
petitioners
in
the
federal
court
in
cleveland.
one
against
united
states
under
the

act,
alleging
negligence
of
the
air
traffic
controllers
in
clearing
the
aircraft
to
takeoff.
because

was
not
existent
between
the
petitioners
a
columbus,
ohio
corporation
and
the
city
of
cleveland,
the
owner
and
the
operators
of

a
second
action
was
filed
at
federal
court
against
the
city
of
cleveland
and
a
respondent
dicken,
also
a
resident
of
ohio,
alleging
admiralty
and
maritime
jurisdiction.
the
complaints
are
virtually
identical.
a
motion
to
consolidate
for

and
all
purposes
including
trial
was
made
by
the
respondents.
city
of
cleveland
moved
nearly
three
years
ago
to
dismiss
the
second
action
on
the
ground
of
no
subject
matter
jurisdiction.
the
district
court
after
six
months
decided
that
there
was
no
subject
matter
jurisdiction
for
two
reasons.
one,
the
locality
of
the
tort
was
over
land.
district
court
relied
on
a
sixth
circuit
case
entitled
wiper
against
great
lakes
engineering
company.
as
an
alternative
holding,
the
district
court
found
that
there
was
no
maritime
nexus
between
the
wrongs
alleged
in
the
complaint
and
any
maritime
commerce
navigation
or
service
relying
on
the
sixth
circuit
case
of
chapman
against
grosse
pointe
farms.
mr.
phillip
d.
bostwick
thank
you
very
much.[luncheon
break]
mr.
phillip
d.
bostwick
thank
you,
your
honor.
the
court
below
in
this
case
with
one
judge
dissenting,
affirmed
that
the
holding
of
the
district
court
insofar
as
the
court
had
ruled
that
the
locality
of
the
tort
was
over
land.
however,
in
so
doing,
it
did
not
follow
its
own
cases,
but
said
this
case
was
controlled
by
three
cases
from
this
court
decided
in
1928
and
1935,
minnie
against
port
huron,
smith
&
son
against
taylor
and
the
admiral
peoples.
the
court
below
said
that
it
was
not
necessary
to
reach
the
question
of
maritime
nexus
having
found
that
the
locality
of
the
tort
was
on
land.
it’s
our
position
--
our
argument
is
twofold
and
it
is
that
there
is
an
irreconcilable
conflict
between
the
opinion
of
the
court
below
on
the
question
of
the
locality
of
the
tort
for
this
case
and
the
third
circuit's
ruling
in
weinstein
and
we
urge
that
this
court
resolve
that
conflict
by
adopting
weinstein
rule.
we
also
urge
that
as
to
the
question
of
maritime
nexus,
this
court
follow
the
course
that
it
took
in
1914
in
atlantic
transport
against
imbrovek
and
find
that
if
anything
more
than
the
locality
of
the
tort
is
required,
that
the
relationship
between
this
tort
and
maritime
affairs
was
quite
sufficient.
now
turning
first
with
regard
to
the
locality
of
the
tort,
the
sixth
circuit
in
this
case,
are
relying
upon
the
three
cases
that
i
just
mentioned,
found
that
the
rule
was
as
to
the
situs
of
the
tort,
that
the
situs
of
the
tort
is
where
the
negligence
becomes
operative
or
effective
on
the
party
not
where
the
damages
or
the
major
portions
of
them
are
sustained.
under
this
legal
rule,
the
court
found
that
the
negligence
became
operative
when
the
birds
first
went
through
the
engine
and
caused
a
loss
of
power
to
the
air
craft
and
that
occurred
over
the
runway.
therefore,
the
locality
of
the
tort
in
this
case,
the
court
found,
was
on
land.
in
so
doing,
the
sixth
circuit
said
that
this
ruling
did
not
conflict
with
the
third
circuit’s
decision
in
1963
in
weinstein
against
eastern
airlines,
found
at
316
f.2d.
we
respectfully
submit
that
that
portion
of
the
court’s
opinion
is
unsupportable.
the
facts
of
the
weinstein
case,
one
of
the
150
cases
to
reach
the
federal
courts,
arising
out
of
the
boston
harbor
tragedy
in
the
early
1960s,
are
virtually
identical
to
this
case.
in
the
boston
harbor
tragedy
the
facts
which
were
reported
in
wrap
against
eastern
airlines.
an
eastern
airline’s
electra
took
off
from
logan
airport
and
six-tenths
of
a
mile
from
the
takeoff
into
the
runway
it
ran
into
a
flight
of
starlings.
the
birds
were
ingested
into
the
engines,
which
were
jet
engines
driving
propellers.
50
to
100
dead
birds
were
found
on
the
end
of
the
runway.
the
birds
caused
an
immediate
loss
of
power
and
the
aircraft
crashed
thereafter
in
the
navigable
waters
of
boston
harbor,
47
seconds
after
liftoff.
the
libellants
brought
libels
in
admiralty
and
the
respondents
claimed
that
there
was
no
jurisdiction.
the
district
judge,
judge
van
dusen
found
that
the
stuff
of
admiralty
concerned
vessels.
but
in
the
absence
of
any
legislation,
like
congress
concerning
aircraft
crashes
in
navigable
territorial
waters
that
the
admiralty
did
not
have
jurisdiction.
on
appeal
to
the
third
circuit,
the
third
circuit
reversed
that
narrow
view.
in
an
opinion
written
in
1963
by
chief
judge
biggs
which
has
been
cited
and
quoted
for
nearly
a
decade
thereafter,
the
third
circuit
held
that
admiralty,
that
concepts
of
admiralty
tort
jurisdiction
could
not
and
should
not
remain
static
and
unchanging.
in
a
review
of
the
law
the
court
noted
that
the
first
aircraft
crash
cases
arose
out
of
the
death
of
a
high
seas
act.
that
the
same
arguments
had
been
made
to
with
that
the
act
did
not
apply
to
aircraft
crashes.
that
view
had
been
rejected.
now
in
this
first
case
of
crash
in
the
territorial
navigable
waters,
chief
judge
biggs
found
that
the
applicable
precedent
from
this
court
was
the
plymouth
and
that
the
historic
view
of
this
court,
indeed
as
expressed
again
by
this
court,
last
term,
in
victory
carriers
against
law
was
that
the
locality
of
the
tort
determined
whether
or
not
it
was
of
a
maritime
nature.
in
determining
where
a
tort
occurs,
chief
judge
biggs
looked
at
that
at
the
plymouth
a
case
from
this
court
which
held
that
a
tort
occurs
where
the
damages
are
completed
or
substantial
amount
of
the
damages
are
completed
and
the
plymouth
held
that
the
maritime
jurisdiction
depends
upon
the
locality
where
the
injuries
or
the
substantial
portion
of
them
take
place.
having
concluded
that
the
plymouth
was
the
applicable
authority,
the
third
circuit
found
that
even
though
the
alleged
negligence
in
the
boston
harbor
tragedy
was
alleged
maintenance
on
land
and
ineffective
design
of
the
aircraft
that
the
“disastrous
effects”
of
that
tortuous
conduct
had
occurred
on
navigable
waters.
that
is
to
say,
the
crash
itself,
the
damage
to
the
aircraft,
the
injuries
and
the
deaths
of
the
passengers
therein
had
occurred
on
navigable
waters.
it,
therefore,
found
in
a
case
virtually
identical
to
this
on
this
factual
situation
that
the
tort
occurred
in
navigable
waters
and
therefore
it
was
a
maritime
tort.
it
was
argued
to
the
third
circuit
that
a
maritime
nexus
was
also
required
in
addition
to
locality
and
that
no
nexus
should
be
found
in
that
case
in
which
an
aircraft
which
was
headed
from
boston
to
philadelphia
virtually
all
over
land
had
crashed
fortuitously
in
waters
of
boston
harbor.
that
view
is
reject
by
the
third
circuit
on
the
reasoning
that
there
is
an
analogy
between
aircraft
which
goes
down
in
navigable
waters
and
ships
would
sink
in
navigable
waters
and
they
found
that
there
is
a
connection.
there
is
a
similarity
and
that
to
dangers
to
person’s
property
are
the
same
when
an
aircraft
crashes
in
navigable
waters.
therefore,
they
assumed
for
purposes
of
argument
that
if
there
was
such
a
locality
plus
requirement,
that
it
was
present
in
that
case,
and
therefore,
they
held
that
there
was
maritime
jurisdiction.
certiorari
was
denied
by
this
court.
that
case
has
been
followed
and
cited
in
nearly
a
decade
since
it
was
passed
on.
mr.
phillip
d.
bostwick
well,
mr.
chief
justice
--
mr.
phillip
d.
bostwick
we
believe
that
the
jurisdictional
point
arises,
if
there
is
a
crash
on
that
flight
and
there
was
some
discussion
in
the
early
days
of
aviation
concerning
whether
the
airspace
above
the
entire
earth
as
well
as
the
sea
was
subject
to
the
maritime
jurisdiction,
but
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
federal
aviation
act
is
based
upon
the
commerce
clause
and
the
regulations
which
affect
aircraft
passing
over
states
and
over
water
and
land
is
based
upon
that
clause,
but
where
there
is
a
crash
on
that
flight,
whether
it
is
beyond
one
marine
league
from
the
shore,
whether
it
is
2400
yards
off
the
the
florida
coast
as
was
the
case
in
kelly,
or
whether
it
is
next
to
the
miami
airport
to
the
closest
navigable
water
on
takeoff
or
landing.
if
the
crash
occurs
in
navigable
water,
it
is
our
position
that
this
court
should
find
and
enunciate
the
following
rule,
that
when
an
aircraft
crashes
in
navigable
water,
tort
claims
arising
therefrom
are
cognizable
on
admiralty.
the
reason
for
our
stand
is
that
we
believe
it
to
be
the
more
practical,
the
simpler
and
more
just
and
efficient
rule
for
aviation
cases,
and
it
is
our
position,
and
it
was
so
held
by
the
third
circuit
and
stated,
we
think,
artistically
by
judge
edwards
in
the
dissent
in
this
case
that
we
believe
that
–
excuse
me,
let
me
start
all
over
again,
i
am
--
mr.
phillip
d.
bostwick
well,
mr.
justice
rehnquist
what
would
follow
we
say
is
that
the
general
maritime
law
would
be
applicable
and
that
as
it's
going
on
for
the
past
30
years
and
those
aircraft
crashes
beyond
a
marine
league
from
the
shore,
the
death
on
a
high
seas
act
would
be
applicable.
mr.
phillip
d.
bostwick
there
is
a
case
like
that
your
honor,
it
is
a
d'aleman.
it's
a
second
circuit
case.
i
believe
it
is
cited
in
the
government’s
brief
and
a
person
did
suffer
a
fright
on
a
flight
from
puerto
rico
to
the
united
states
over
water
and
died
thereafter
and
was
held
to
be
in
admiralty
and
i
would
refer
the
court
to
the
analogy
of
the
congress
making
crime
which
occur
in
aircraft
over
navigable
waters
within
the
maritime
jurisdiction.
it
is
in
fact,
the
injury
which
occurs
on
or
over
navigable
waters
which
makes
it
a
maritime
tort
and
brings
into
play
the
general
maritime
law
and
in
effect
--
mr.
phillip
d.
bostwick
you
mean
an
aircraft
crashing
on
a
bridge,
your
honor?
mr.
phillip
d.
bostwick
well,
we
don’t
believe
that
this
court
is
going
to
be
required
to
rule
on
automobile
cases
in
this
case.
we
believe
that
a
holding
in
this
case
that
when
an
aircraft
crashes
in
navigable
waters,
the
tort
claims
arising
therefrom
are
within
maritime
jurisdiction.
it
does
not
call
upon
to
this
court
to
decide
that
case.
in
fact,
there
is
a
case
of
an
automobile
driving
off
a
pontoon
barge
in
new
orleans
and
the
car
that
was
going
from
the
ferry
to
the
land
was
in
admiralty
and
the
one
going
the
other
way
was
not
and
in
fact
there
is
a
myriad
of
decisions.
mr.
phillip
d.
bostwick
well,
for
car
that
drives
off
the
bridge
in
navigable
waters,
if
the
person
is
killed
in
--
mr.
phillip
d.
bostwick
if
the
person
were
injured
in
the
water
we
believe
it
would
be
a
maritime
tort,
but
again
we
respectfully
state
that
it
is
the
nature
of
the
aviation
activities
here
which
cause
us
to
urge
the
present
ruling
upon
the
court.
we
are
not
urging
a
rule
upon
the
court
in
automobile
cases
and
i
am
not
trying
to
duck
the
court’s
question,
however
--
mr.
phillip
d.
bostwick
i
will
be
as
specific
as
i
can.
mr.
phillip
d.
bostwick
well,
if
the
court
please,
i
believe
the
government
has
urged
that
this
court
use
this
case
to
fashion
a
locality
plus
rule.
for
once,
we
agree
with
the
city,
we
respond
to
city
of
cleveland
in
the
view
that,
that
is
not
required
in
this
case.
we
believe
a
holding
in
this
case
concerning
aircraft
crashes
in
navigable
waters
does
not
require
the
court
to
make
a
statement
about
the
type
of
hypothetical
which
has
been
presented
and
it
leaves
the
lower
courts
free
in
the
situation
where
a
swimmer
is
injured
in
18
inches
of
water
or
where
there
is
a
rear-end
collision
on
a
pontoon
barge
between
two
automobiles
waiting
for
a
ferry.
it
leaves
the
lower
courts
free
to
continue
to
decide
those
few,
and
i
emphasize
the
fact
that
they
are
few,
to
decide
those
few
cases
if
they
so
decide
on
a
locality
plus
basis.
we
do
not
believe
that
this
case
raises
the
locality
plus
question
and
that
the
hypotheticals
concerning
the
automobiles
need
to
be
decided
because
of
a
ruling
in
this
case
that
aircraft
crashes
in
navigable
waters
bring
about
maritime
tort
claims.
mr.
phillip
d.
bostwick
the
locality
basis
has
to
do
with
the
aviation
cases
because,
assuming
arguendo
there
is
a
plus
required
that
it
is
present
in
the
aviation
cases
and
we
do
not
believe
that
it
is
present
only
in
those
cases
where
the
aircraft
is
being
used
as
it
was
previously
used,
like
a
vessel
or
whatever
it's
90%
of
its
flight
has
been
over
water
as
opposed
to
5%
over
the
land.
mr.
phillip
d.
bostwick
well,
that's
a
--
if
the
court
please,
a
good
question
and
i
have
been
--
mr.
phillip
d.
bostwick
we
believe
it
to
be
same
plus
stated
by
the
third
circuit
in
weinstein
and
by
dissenting
judge
in
this
case,
that
is
the
relationship
between
a
downed
aircraft
in
navigable
waters
and
the
perils
that
occur
to
the
pilots
and
the
passengers
and
the
analogy
to
a
downed
ship.
in
other
words,
there
is
nothing
fortuitous
to
a
man
who
is
drowning
in
navigable
waters,
but
if
he
got
there
because
his
boat
tipped
over
or
because
this
airplane
crashed
in
it
just
off
the
shore,
there
is
an
analogy
between
the
salvage
problems
and
navigational
problems
in
the
channel.
mr.
phillip
d.
bostwick
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
i
am
not
taking
the
position
that
an
automobile
is
necessarily
outside
an
automobile
crash
in
which
people
are
killed
going
off
a
bridge,
is
necessarily
outside
of
admiralty
jurisdiction
and
as
i
say
there
are
some
cases
in
which
admiralty
has
taken
cognizance
of
automobile
cases.
but
i
respectfully
do
not
believe
the
court
needs
to
reach
that
here
by
holding
that
in
aviation
cases,
there
is
--
the
tort
claims
are
rising
auto
crashes
in
navigable
waters.
mr.
phillip
d.
bostwick
very
well,
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
court
in
new
orleans
agreed
and
found
that
the
injuries
as
a
result
of
drowning
and
the
horror
that
goes
along
with
seeing
your
husband
drown
meant
that
an
automobile
crash
into
navigable
waters
was
admiralty.
so,
therefore,
i
am
not
taking
the
position
that
the
automobile
case
is
not
an
admiralty.
mr.
phillip
d.
bostwick
yes,
sir.
mr.
phillip
d.
bostwick
well,
if
the
--
mr.
phillip
d.
bostwick
well,
if
the
crash
occurred
--
the
automobile
crash
occurred
and
a
person
were
drowned
in
navigable
waters,
we
believe
that
the
wrongful
death
claim
would
come
about
under
this
states'
--
under
this
court’s
holding
in
(inaudible)
--
that
there
would
--
mr.
phillip
d.
bostwick
general
maritime
law
would
apply.
mr.
phillip
d.
bostwick
to
the
automobile
accident
in
which
the
car
goes
into
the
navigable
water,
i
thought
that
was
your
--
mr.
phillip
d.
bostwick
well,
it's
our
view
that
if
the
person
died
as
a
result
of
being
in
navigable
water,
then
the
fault
would
be
determined
by
the
general
maritime
principles
which
utilize
comparative
negligence
and
have
a
cause
of
action
for
wrongful
death.
there
is,
i
might
say,
an
additional
distinction
--
mr.
phillip
d.
bostwick
no
sir,
i
wish
to
reserve
few
moments
in
rebuttal,
but
in
answer
to
your
question
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
the
aircraft
which
fly
over
navigable
waters
as
distinguished
from
automobiles,
do
have
a
maritime
plus
in
that
the
majority
of
the
passengers
which
used
to
travel
by
boat,
now
travel
by
air
and
there
is
a
need,
there
is
a
vast
number
of
aviation
accidents,
because
of
the
number
of
airports
built
on
and
around
navigable
waters
and
the
number
of
accidents
which
occur
in
and
around
the
landing
patterns.
there
is
a
large
number
of
aircraft
crashes
in
navigable
waters,
in
territorial
navigable
waters
and
we
believe
that
they
present
a
problem
which
has
been
solved
by
the
lower
courts
under
weinstein
and
that
rule
is
the
proper
one
which
should
be
continued
and
ratified
by
this
court.
mr.
phillip
d.
bostwick
well,
it
is
my
understanding
that
the
government
would
find
that
in
some
aircraft
crashes,
for
example,
the
plane
that
lands
in
the
water
on
the
flight
from
washington
to
chicago,
but
which
lands
in
lake
michigan
fortuitously
that,
that
would
not
be
in
maritime
nexus,
not
in
maritime
place
--
mr.
phillip
d.
bostwick
it
is
no
substitute
at
all,
your
honor,
but
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
the
people
who
are
faced
with
possibly
drowning
in
lake
michigan
meet
the
same
parallels
as
anyone
else
in
navigable
water.
mr.
phillip
d.
bostwick
thank
you
very
much,
your
honor.
i'll
be
very
brief.
with
regard
to
few
of
the
question
concerning
the
facts
of
the
allegations
of
contributory
negligence.
i
just
would
like
to
clear
up
that
in
an
un-sworn
statement,
the
air
traffic
controller
did
say
that
he
said
to
the
pilots,
it
looks
like
a
million
birds
or
words
of
that
effect.
however,
there
is
no
tape
recording
in
this
case
from
the
tower
for
an
unknown
reason
and
it
is
undisputed
that
the
pilots
did
not
acknowledge
hearing
that
transmission
and
asked
for
a
further
clearance
for
takeoff
and
it
is
un-contradicted
that,
on
the
second
clearance,
the
air
traffic
controller
simply
said,
“cleared
for
takeoff”
without
any
reference
to
the
birds
at
all.
and
i
think
it
is
clear
beyond
doubt
in
the
regulations
that
the
traffic
controllers
do
have
the
power
to
hold
aircraft
on
the
runway
when
there
are
dangers
on
the
runaway.
now
with
regard
to
the
legal
points
raised
by
the
solicitor
general,
i
would
just
simply
state
that
it
is
true,
there
are
no
decisions
by
this
court
concerning
aircraft
crisis
in
navigable
waters.
as
the
judge
pointed
out
in
the
dissenting
opinion,
there
are
however,
about
30
years
worth
of
decisions
in
the
lower
federal
courts
concerning
this
very
point,
both
under
the
death
on
the
high
seas
act,
the
personal
injury
cases,
property
damage
cases,
cases
within
the
general
maritime
law,
under
the
general
maritime
law
within
territorial
navigable
waters.
without
exception,
every
one
of
those
cases
hold
that
the
tort
claims
arising
out
of
the
crash
of
an
aircraft
in
the
navigable
waters
is
cognizable
in
admiralty.
the
case
with
the
court
below,
is
the
only
case
to
my
knowledge,
other
than
judge
van
dusen's
decision,
which
was
reversed
in
weinstein
holding
that
such
crash
is
not
cognizable
in
admiralty.
therefore,
i
know
that
this
court
is
aware
of
line
of
precedent,
i
also
know
that
it
is
conceivable,
this
court
can
now
enunciate
a
totally
new
rule
without
regard
to
those
lower
court
decisions.
mr.
phillip
d.
bostwick
isn't
the
court
below's
opinion
wholly
consistent
with
ours,
is
that
--
i
am
sorry?
mr.
phillip
d.
bostwick
well,
i
don't
believe
so
your
honor.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
united
states
has
virtually
conceded,
the
government
has
virtually
conceded
a
conflict
between
--
mr.
phillip
d.
bostwick
cleveland's
position
is
that
the
wharf
case
is
controlling,
and
we
would
urge
that
because
of
the
very
playing
a
game,
which
was
referred
to
by
the
solicitor
general
and
the
very
complexity
and
the
need
to
have
pre-litigation
concerning
jurisdictional
questions
and
questions
of
which
substantive
law
is
applicable,
that
this
court
should
not
follow
that
rule.
this
court
should
enunciate
a
rule,
such
as
found
in
the
federal
rule
of
civil
procedures
to
reach
just
median
inexpensive
determination
of
the
litigation
on
the
merits.
there
should
be
a
rule
which
determines
these
questions
of
jurisdiction
applicable
substantive
law
without
regard
to
metaphysical
phrase
such
as,
where
causes
of
action
arise
or
where
torts
occur
or
where
the
impact
occurs.
this
language
which
is
found
in
the
longshoreman
and
harbor
workers'
compensation
cases,
we
say,
has
no
place
in
the
future
of
aviation
and
space
activities,
and
we
would
rest
primarily
on
the
decisions
of
the
third
circuit
in
weinstein
and
on
the
dissenting
court
in
judging
of
this
case.
thank
you.
mr.
phillip
d.
bostwick
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
on
certiorari
to
sixth
circuit
calls
upon
this
court
to
resolve
any
records
out
of
the
conflict
between
the
third
circuit
in
an
opinion
of
the
court
below.
the
issue
presented
is
whether
the
federal
courts
have
maritime
jurisdiction
over
airplane
crashes
in
navigable
waters
where
the
tortuous
conduct
is
alleged
to
have
occurred
on
land.
the
facts
in
this
case
are
under
perjury
undisputed.
the
petitioners
are
the
owner
and
operator
of
a
corporate
twin-engine
jet
aircraft,
known
as
the
falcon.
they
and
their
aircraft
prepared
to
takeoff
from
burke
lakefront
airport
at
cleveland,
ohio
on
july
of
1968.
burke
lakefront
is
owned
and
operated
by
the
respondent
city
of
cleveland,
ohio
and
is
built
on
a
fill
and
the
navigable
waters
of
lake
erie.
on
the
day
in
question,
the
aircraft
was
piloted
by
two
pilots
and
had
a
crew
of
one
stewardess
and
was
prepared
to
takeoff
to
pick
up
passengers
in
maine.
there
is
some
question
in
the
record
as
to
the
clearance
given
to
the
pilots
before
takeoff.
it
our
position
that
the
questions
of
tributary
negligence
not
being
before
this
court,
those
matters
are
irrelevant,
however
they
have
been
raised
in
the
respondent's
briefs.
in
any
event
there
is
no
question
about
the
fact
that
the
pilots
did
see
--
could
not
see
the
other
end
of
the
runway
before
takeoff,
could
not
see
that
the
last
third
of
the
runway
was
covered
by
a
flock
of
seagulls
and
did
receive
a
clearance
for
takeoff
from
the
air
traffic
controllers
in
the
tower,
from
respondent
dicken
who
is
employed
by
the
united
states
government.
the
aircraft
took
off.
shortly
after
liftoff,
the
pilots
noticed
for
the
first
time
the
sea
of
seagulls.
as
the
plane
approached
the
seagulls,
the
flock
rose,
the
aircraft
struck
many
of
the
birds,
314
of
the
seagulls
were
found
on
the
runway
alone.
thereafter,
birds
were
ingested
into
the
engines
of
the
jet,
the
engines
flamed
out
and
the
pilot
prepared
for
a
ditching.
he
raised
the
landing
gear
and
prepared
for
a
crash
landing.
on
the
way
down,
the
aircraft
landing
gear
did
strike
the
top
of
a
pickup
truck
parked
near
the
airport
perimeter
fence
and
broke
the
barbwire
of
the
perimeter
fence.
and
there
is
an
appendix
of
photographs
to
this
case
which
shows
the
damage
done
to
the
vehicle
and
the
fence,
birds
on
the
runway
for
the
whatever
use
it
maybe
to
the
court.
in
any
event
the
aircraft
continued
in
flight
and
impacted
in
the
navigable
waters
of
lake
erie.
when
airborne
again,
it
impacted
a
second
time
where
it
sank
in
what
has
been
undisputed
navigable
waters,
something
in
depth
of
an
excess
of
45
feet.
there
is
also
a
photograph,
i
believe
it's
photograph
three
showing
an
x
out
in
the
lake
when
the
aircraft
submerged
the
pilots
and
stewardess
miraculously
were
not
injured
or
killed.
they
exited
from
the
aircraft
and
a
small
craft
picked
them
up.
the
coastguard
came,
there
was
an
effort
made
to
put
a
line
around
the
aircraft
and
pull
it
towards
shore
and
the
place
where
they
succeeded
in
dragging
it
is
the
second
x
on
the
photograph.
mr.
phillip
d.
bostwick
it
was
a
jet,
yes
sir.
it
was
a
corporate
jet,
a
small
falcon
jet
owned
by
executive
jet
aviation
and
used
for
purposes
of
transporting
business
and
other
persons?
mr.
phillip
d.
bostwick
the
crew
were
deadheading
if
the
court
pleased
to
pick
up
some
revenue
paying
passengers
at
another
airport.
it
had
been
positioned
at
burke
lakefront
airport.
the
aircraft
was
salvaged
after
remaining
submerged
in
the
lake
for
two
days.
skin
divers
were
used,
a
contract
barge
was
used
and
the
aircraft
was
raised.
it
was
dropped
back
into
the
lake
during
raising
and
additional
damage
was
done.
in
any
event
when
it
had
been
retrieved
from
the
lake,
after
over
two
days,
the
extensive
water
soaking
to
the
expensive
avionics
navigation
and
equipment
and
instruments,
and
to
the
interior
of
the
aircraft,
the
impact
damage
which
had
been
done
to
the
fuselage
of
the
aircraft
by
the
two
impacts
at
the
lake
caused
the
aircraft
to
be
a
total
loss.
and
there
is
no
dispute
in
this
case
of
two
facts;
one
that
the
aircraft
did
crash
in
navigable
waters
of
lake
erie
and
two
that
as
a
result
of
that
crash
in
the
lake
the
aircraft
was
totally
destroyed.
two
actions
were
brought
by
the
petitioners
in
the
federal
court
in
cleveland.
one
against
united
states
under
the
tort
claims
act,
alleging
negligence
of
the
air
traffic
controllers
in
clearing
the
aircraft
to
takeoff.
because

was
not
existent
between
the
petitioners
a
columbus,
ohio
corporation
and
the
city
of
cleveland,
the
owner
and
the
operators
of

a
second
action
was
filed
at
federal
court
against
the
city
of
cleveland
and
a
respondent
dicken,
also
a
resident
of
ohio,
alleging
admiralty
and
maritime
jurisdiction.
the
complaints
are
virtually
identical.
a
motion
to
consolidate
for

and
all
purposes
including
trial
was
made
by
the
respondents.
city
of
cleveland
moved
nearly
three
years
ago
to
dismiss
the
second
action
on
the
ground
of
no
subject

the
district
court
after
six
months
decided
that
there
was
no
subject

for
two
reasons.
one,
the
locality
of

was
over

district
court
relied
on
a
sixth
circuit
case
entitled
wiper
against

lakes

company.
as
an
alternative
holding,
the
district
court
found
that
there
was
no
maritime
nexus
between
the
wrongs
alleged
in
the
complaint
and
any
maritime
commerce

or
service
relying
on
the
sixth
circuit

of

against

mr.
phillip
d.
bostwick
thank
you
very
much.[luncheon

mr.
phillip
d.
bostwick
thank
you,
your
honor.
the
court
below
in
this
case
with
one
judge
dissenting,
affirmed
that
the
holding
of
the
district
court
insofar
as
the
court
had
ruled
that
the
locality
of
the
tort
was
over
land.
however,
in
so
doing,
it
did
not
follow
its
own
cases,
but
said
this
case
was
controlled
by
three
cases
from
this
court
decided
in
1928
and
1935,
minnie
against
port
huron,
smith
&
son
against
taylor
and
the
admiral
peoples.
the
court
below
said
that
it
was
not
necessary
to
reach
the
question
of
maritime
nexus
having
found
that
the
locality
of
the
tort
was
on
land.
it’s
our
position
--
our
argument
is
twofold
and
it
is
that
there
is
an
irreconcilable
conflict
between
the
opinion
of
the
court
below
on
the
question
of
the
locality
of
the
tort
for
this
case
and
the
third
circuit's
ruling
in
weinstein
and
we
urge
that
this
court
resolve
that
conflict
by
adopting
weinstein
rule.
we
also
urge
that
as
to
the
question
of
maritime
nexus,
this
court
follow
the
course
that
it
took
in
1914
in
atlantic
transport
against
imbrovek
and
find
that
if
anything
more
than
the
locality
of
the
tort
is
required,
that
the
relationship
between
this
tort
and
maritime
affairs
was
quite
sufficient.
now
turning
first
with
regard
to
the
locality
of
the
tort,
the
sixth
circuit
in
this
case,
are
relying
upon
the
three
cases
that
i
just
mentioned,
found
that
the
rule
was
as
to
the
situs
of
the
tort,
that
the
situs
of
the
tort
is
where
the
negligence
becomes
operative
or
effective
on
the
party
not
where
the
damages
or
the
major
portions
of
them
are
sustained.
under
this
legal
rule,
the
court
found
that
the
negligence
became
operative
when
the
birds
first
went
through
the
engine
and
caused
a
loss
of
power
to
the
air
craft
and
that
occurred
over
the
runway.
therefore,
the
locality
of
the
tort
in
this
case,
the
court
found,
was
on
land.
in
so
doing,
the
sixth
circuit
said
that
this
ruling
did
not
conflict
with
the
third
circuit’s
decision
in
1963
in
weinstein
against
eastern
airlines,
found
at
316
f.2d.
we
respectfully
submit
that
that
portion
of
the
court’s
opinion
is
unsupportable.
the
facts
of
the
weinstein
case,
one
of
the
150
cases
to
reach
the
federal
courts,
arising
out
of
the
boston
harbor
tragedy
in
the
early
1960s,
are
virtually
identical
to
this
case.
in
the
boston
harbor
tragedy
the
facts
which
were
reported
in
wrap
against
eastern
airlines.
an
eastern
airline’s
electra
took
off
from
logan
airport
and
six-tenths
of
a
mile
from
the
takeoff
into
the
runway
it
ran
into
a
flight
of
starlings.
the
birds
were
ingested
into
the
engines,
which
were
jet
engines
driving
propellers.
50
to
100
dead
birds
were
found
on
the
end
of
the
runway.
the
birds
caused
an
immediate
loss
of
power
and
the
aircraft
crashed
thereafter
in
the
navigable
waters
of
boston
harbor,
47
seconds
after
liftoff.
the
libellants
brought
libels
in
admiralty
and
the
respondents
claimed
that
there
was
no
jurisdiction.
the
district
judge,
judge
van
dusen
found
that
the
stuff
of
admiralty
concerned
vessels.
but
in
the
absence
of
any
legislation,
like
congress
concerning
aircraft
crashes
in
navigable
territorial
waters
that
the
admiralty
did
not
have
jurisdiction.
on
appeal
to
the
third
circuit,
the
third
circuit
reversed
that
narrow
view.
in
an
opinion
written
in
1963
by
chief
judge
biggs
which
has
been
cited
and
quoted
for
nearly
a
decade
thereafter,
the
third
circuit
held
that
admiralty,
that
concepts
of
admiralty
tort
jurisdiction
could
not
and
should
not
remain
static
and
unchanging.
in
a
review
of
the
law
the
court
noted
that
the
first
aircraft
crash
cases
arose
out
of
the
death
of
a
high
seas
act.
that
the
same
arguments
had
been
made
to
with
that
the
act
did
not
apply
to
aircraft
crashes.
that
view
had
been
rejected.
now
in
this
first
case
of
crash
in
the
territorial
navigable
waters,
chief
judge
biggs
found
that
the
applicable
precedent
from
this
court
was
the
plymouth
and
that
the
historic
view
of
this
court,
indeed
as
expressed
again
by
this
court,
last
term,
in
victory
carriers
against
law
was
that
the
locality
of
the
tort
determined
whether
or
not
it
was
of
a
maritime
nature.
in
determining
where
a
tort
occurs,
chief
judge
biggs
looked
at
that
at
the
plymouth
a
case
from
this
court
which
held
that
a
tort
occurs
where
the
damages
are
completed
or
substantial
amount
of
the
damages
are
completed
and
the
plymouth
held
that
the
maritime
jurisdiction
depends
upon
the
locality
where
the
injuries
or
the
substantial
portion
of
them
take
place.
having
concluded
that
the
plymouth
was
the
applicable
authority,
the
third
circuit
found
that
even
though
the
alleged
negligence
in
the
boston
harbor
tragedy
was
alleged
maintenance
on
land
and
ineffective
design
of
the
aircraft
that
the
“disastrous
effects”
of
that
tortuous
conduct
had
occurred
on
navigable
waters.
that
is
to
say,
the
crash
itself,
the
damage
to
the
aircraft,
the
injuries
and
the
deaths
of
the
passengers
therein
had
occurred
on
navigable
waters.
it,
therefore,
found
in
a
case
virtually
identical
to
this
on
this
factual
situation
that
the
tort
occurred
in
navigable
waters
and
therefore
it
was
a
maritime
tort.
it
was
argued
to
the
third
circuit
that
a
maritime
nexus
was
also
required
in
addition
to
locality
and
that
no
nexus
should
be
found
in
that
case
in
which
an
aircraft
which
was
headed
from
boston
to
philadelphia
virtually
all
over
land
had
crashed
fortuitously
in
waters
of
boston
harbor.
that
view
is
reject
by
the
third
circuit
on
the
reasoning
that
there
is
an
analogy
between
aircraft
which
goes
down
in
navigable
waters
and
ships
would
sink
in
navigable
waters
and
they
found
that
there
is
a
connection.
there
is
a
similarity
and
that
to
dangers
to
person’s
property
are
the
same
when
an
aircraft
crashes
in
navigable
waters.
therefore,
they
assumed
for
purposes
of
argument
that
if
there
was
such
a
locality
plus
requirement,
that
it
was
present
in
that
case,
and
therefore,
they
held
that
there
was
maritime
jurisdiction.
certiorari
was
denied
by
this
court.
that
case
has
been
followed
and
cited
in
nearly
a
decade
since
it
was
passed
on.
mr.
phillip
d.
bostwick
well,
mr.
chief
justice
--
mr.
phillip
d.
bostwick
we
believe
that
the
jurisdictional
point
arises,
if
there
is
a
crash
on
that
flight
and
there
was
some
discussion
in
the
early
days
of
aviation
concerning
whether
the
airspace
above
the
entire
earth
as
well
as
the
sea
was
subject
to
the
maritime
jurisdiction,
but
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
federal
aviation
act
is
based
upon
the
commerce
clause
and
the
regulations
which
affect
aircraft
passing
over
states
and
over
water
and
land
is
based
upon
that
clause,
but
where
there
is
a
crash
on
that
flight,
whether
it
is
beyond
one
marine
league
from
the
shore,
whether
it
is
2400
yards
off
the
the
florida
coast
as
was
the
case
in
kelly,
or
whether
it
is
next
to
the
miami
airport
to
the
closest
navigable
water
on
takeoff
or
landing.
if
the
crash
occurs
in
navigable
water,
it
is
our
position
that
this
court
should
find
and
enunciate
the
following
rule,
that
when
an
aircraft
crashes
in
navigable
water,
tort
claims
arising
therefrom
are
cognizable
on
admiralty.
the
reason
for
our
stand
is
that
we
believe
it
to
be
the
more
practical,
the
simpler
and
more
just
and
efficient
rule
for
aviation
cases,
and
it
is
our
position,
and
it
was
so
held
by
the
third
circuit
and
stated,
we
think,
artistically
by
judge
edwards
in
the
dissent
in
this
case
that
we
believe
that
–
excuse
me,
let
me
start
all
over
again,
i
am
--
mr.
phillip
d.
bostwick
well,
mr.
justice
rehnquist
what
would
follow
we
say
is
that
the
general
maritime
law
would
be
applicable
and
that
as
it's
going
on
for
the
past
30
years
and
those
aircraft
crashes
beyond
a
marine
league
from
the
shore,
the
death
on
a
high
seas
act
would
be
applicable.
mr.
phillip
d.
bostwick
there
is
a
case
like
that
your
honor,
it
is
a
d'aleman.
it's
a
second
circuit
case.
i
believe
it
is
cited
in
the
government’s
brief
and
a
person
did
suffer
a
fright
on
a
flight
from
puerto
rico
to
the
united
states
over
water
and
died
thereafter
and
was
held
to
be
in
admiralty
and
i
would
refer
the
court
to
the
analogy
of
the
congress
making
crime
which
occur
in
aircraft
over
navigable
waters
within
the
maritime
jurisdiction.
it
is
in
fact,
the
injury
which
occurs
on
or
over
navigable
waters
which
makes
it
a
maritime
tort
and
brings
into
play
the
general
maritime
law
and
in
effect
--
mr.
phillip
d.
bostwick
you
mean
an
aircraft
crashing
on
a
bridge,
your
honor?
mr.
phillip
d.
bostwick
well,
we
don’t
believe
that
this
court
is
going
to
be
required
to
rule
on
automobile
cases
in
this
case.
we
believe
that
a
holding
in
this
case
that
when
an
aircraft
crashes
in
navigable
waters,
the
tort
claims
arising
therefrom
are
within
maritime
jurisdiction.
it
does
not
call
upon
to
this
court
to
decide
that
case.
in
fact,
there
is
a
case
of
an
automobile
driving
off
a
pontoon
barge
in
new
orleans
and
the
car
that
was
going
from
the
ferry
to
the
land
was
in
admiralty
and
the
one
going
the
other
way
was
not
and
in
fact
there
is
a
myriad
of
decisions.
mr.
phillip
d.
bostwick
well,
for
car
that
drives
off
the
bridge
in
navigable
waters,
if
the
person
is
killed
in
--
mr.
phillip
d.
bostwick
if
the
person
were
injured
in
the
water
we
believe
it
would
be
a
maritime
tort,
but
again
we
respectfully
state
that
it
is
the
nature
of
the
aviation
activities
here
which
cause
us
to
urge
the
present
ruling
upon
the
court.
we
are
not
urging
a
rule
upon
the
court
in
automobile
cases
and
i
am
not
trying
to
duck
the
court’s
question,
however
--
mr.
phillip
d.
bostwick
i
will
be
as
specific
as
i
can.
mr.
phillip
d.
bostwick
well,
if
the
court
please,
i
believe
the
government
has
urged
that
this
court
use
this
case
to
fashion
a
locality
plus
rule.
for
once,
we
agree
with
the
city,
we
respond
to
city
of
cleveland
in
the
view
that,
that
is
not
required
in
this
case.
we
believe
a
holding
in
this
case
concerning
aircraft
crashes
in
navigable
waters
does
not
require
the
court
to
make
a
statement
about
the
type
of
hypothetical
which
has
been
presented
and
it
leaves
the
lower
courts
free
in
the
situation
where
a
swimmer
is
injured
in
18
inches
of
water
or
where
there
is
a
rear-end
collision
on
a
pontoon
barge
between
two
automobiles
waiting
for
a
ferry.
it
leaves
the
lower
courts
free
to
continue
to
decide
those
few,
and
i
emphasize
the
fact
that
they
are
few,
to
decide
those
few
cases
if
they
so
decide
on
a
locality
plus
basis.
we
do
not
believe
that
this
case
raises
the
locality
plus
question
and
that
the
hypotheticals
concerning
the
automobiles
need
to
be
decided
because
of
a
ruling
in
this
case
that
aircraft
crashes
in
navigable
waters
bring
about
maritime
tort
claims.
mr.
phillip
d.
bostwick
the
locality
basis
has
to
do
with
the
aviation
cases
because,
assuming
arguendo
there
is
a
plus
required
that
it
is
present
in
the
aviation
cases
and
we
do
not
believe
that
it
is
present
only
in
those
cases
where
the
aircraft
is
being
used
as
it
was
previously
used,
like
a
vessel
or
whatever
it's
90%
of
its
flight
has
been
over
water
as
opposed
to
5%
over
the
land.
mr.
phillip
d.
bostwick
well,
that's
a
--
if
the
court
please,
a
good
question
and
i
have
been
--
mr.
phillip
d.
bostwick
we
believe
it
to
be
same
plus
stated
by
the
third
circuit
in
weinstein
and
by
dissenting
judge
in
this
case,
that
is
the
relationship
between
a
downed
aircraft
in
navigable
waters
and
the
perils
that
occur
to
the
pilots
and
the
passengers
and
the
analogy
to
a
downed
ship.
in
other
words,
there
is
nothing
fortuitous
to
a
man
who
is
drowning
in
navigable
waters,
but
if
he
got
there
because
his
boat
tipped
over
or
because
this
airplane
crashed
in
it
just
off
the
shore,
there
is
an
analogy
between
the
salvage
problems
and
navigational
problems
in
the
channel.
mr.
phillip
d.
bostwick
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
i
am
not
taking
the
position
that
an
automobile
is
necessarily
outside
an
automobile
crash
in
which
people
are
killed
going
off
a
bridge,
is
necessarily
outside
of
admiralty
jurisdiction
and
as
i
say
there
are
some
cases
in
which
admiralty
has
taken
cognizance
of
automobile
cases.
but
i
respectfully
do
not
believe
the
court
needs
to
reach
that
here
by
holding
that
in
aviation
cases,
there
is
--
the
tort
claims
are
rising
auto
crashes
in
navigable
waters.
mr.
phillip
d.
bostwick
very
well,
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
court
in
new
orleans
agreed
and
found
that
the
injuries
as
a
result
of
drowning
and
the
horror
that
goes
along
with
seeing
your
husband
drown
meant
that
an
automobile
crash
into
navigable
waters
was
admiralty.
so,
therefore,
i
am
not
taking
the
position
that
the
automobile
case
is
not
an
admiralty.
mr.
phillip
d.
bostwick
yes,
sir.
mr.
phillip
d.
bostwick
well,
if
the
--
mr.
phillip
d.
bostwick
well,
if
the
crash
occurred
--
the
automobile
crash
occurred
and
a
person
were
drowned
in
navigable
waters,
we
believe
that
the
wrongful
death
claim
would
come
about
under
this
states'
--
under
this
court’s
holding
in
(inaudible)
--
that
there
would
--
mr.
phillip
d.
bostwick
general
maritime
law
would
apply.
mr.
phillip
d.
bostwick
to
the
automobile
accident
in
which
the
car
goes
into
the
navigable
water,
i
thought
that
was
your
--
mr.
phillip
d.
bostwick
well,
it's
our
view
that
if
the
person
died
as
a
result
of
being
in
navigable
water,
then
the
fault
would
be
determined
by
the
general
maritime
principles
which
utilize
comparative
negligence
and
have
a
cause
of
action
for
wrongful
death.
there
is,
i
might
say,
an
additional
distinction
--
mr.
phillip
d.
bostwick
no
sir,
i
wish
to
reserve
few
moments
in
rebuttal,
but
in
answer
to
your
question
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
the
aircraft
which
fly
over
navigable
waters
as
distinguished
from
automobiles,
do
have
a
maritime
plus
in
that
the
majority
of
the
passengers
which
used
to
travel
by
boat,
now
travel
by
air
and
there
is
a
need,
there
is
a
vast
number
of
aviation
accidents,
because
of
the
number
of
airports
built
on
and
around
navigable
waters
and
the
number
of
accidents
which
occur
in
and
around
the
landing
patterns.
there
is
a
large
number
of
aircraft
crashes
in
navigable
waters,
in
territorial
navigable
waters
and
we
believe
that
they
present
a
problem
which
has
been
solved
by
the
lower
courts
under
weinstein
and
that
rule
is
the
proper
one
which
should
be
continued
and
ratified
by
this
court.
mr.
phillip
d.
bostwick
well,
it
is
my
understanding
that
the
government
would
find
that
in
some
aircraft
crashes,
for
example,
the
plane
that
lands
in
the
water
on
the
flight
from
washington
to
chicago,
but
which
lands
in
lake
michigan
fortuitously
that,
that
would
not
be
in
maritime
nexus,
not
in
maritime
place
--
mr.
phillip
d.
bostwick
it
is
no
substitute
at
all,
your
honor,
but
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
the
people
who
are
faced
with
possibly
drowning
in
lake
michigan
meet
the
same
parallels
as
anyone
else
in
navigable
water.
mr.
phillip
d.
bostwick
thank
you
very
much,
your
honor.
i'll
be
very
brief.
with
regard
to
few
of
the
question
concerning
the
facts
of
the
allegations
of
contributory
negligence.
i
just
would
like
to
clear
up
that
in
an
un-sworn
statement,
the
air
traffic
controller
did
say
that
he
said
to
the
pilots,
it
looks
like
a
million
birds
or
words
of
that
effect.
however,
there
is
no
tape
recording
in
this
case
from
the
tower
for
an
unknown
reason
and
it
is
undisputed
that
the
pilots
did
not
acknowledge
hearing
that
transmission
and
asked
for
a
further
clearance
for
takeoff
and
it
is
un-contradicted
that,
on
the
second
clearance,
the
air
traffic
controller
simply
said,
“cleared
for
takeoff”
without
any
reference
to
the
birds
at
all.
and
i
think
it
is
clear
beyond
doubt
in
the
regulations
that
the
traffic
controllers
do
have
the
power
to
hold
aircraft
on
the
runway
when
there
are
dangers
on
the
runaway.
now
with
regard
to
the
legal
points
raised
by
the
solicitor
general,
i
would
just
simply
state
that
it
is
true,
there
are
no
decisions
by
this
court
concerning
aircraft
crisis
in
navigable
waters.
as
the
judge
pointed
out
in
the
dissenting
opinion,
there
are
however,
about
30
years
worth
of
decisions
in
the
lower
federal
courts
concerning
this
very
point,
both
under
the
death
on
the
high
seas
act,
the
personal
injury
cases,
property
damage
cases,
cases
within
the
general
maritime
law,
under
the
general
maritime
law
within
territorial
navigable
waters.
without
exception,
every
one
of
those
cases
hold
that
the
tort
claims
arising
out
of
the
crash
of
an
aircraft
in
the
navigable
waters
is
cognizable
in
admiralty.
the
case
with
the
court
below,
is
the
only
case
to
my
knowledge,
other
than
judge
van
dusen's
decision,
which
was
reversed
in
weinstein
holding
that
such
crash
is
not
cognizable
in
admiralty.
therefore,
i
know
that
this
court
is
aware
of
line
of
precedent,
i
also
know
that
it
is
conceivable,
this
court
can
now
enunciate
a
totally
new
rule
without
regard
to
those
lower
court
decisions.
mr.
phillip
d.
bostwick
isn't
the
court
below's
opinion
wholly
consistent
with
ours,
is
that
--
i
am
sorry?
mr.
phillip
d.
bostwick
well,
i
don't
believe
so
your
honor.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
united
states
has
virtually
conceded,
the
government
has
virtually
conceded
a
conflict
between
--
mr.
phillip
d.
bostwick
cleveland's
position
is
that
the
wharf
case
is
controlling,
and
we
would
urge
that
because
of
the
very
playing
a
game,
which
was
referred
to
by
the
solicitor
general
and
the
very
complexity
and
the
need
to
have
pre-litigation
concerning
jurisdictional
questions
and
questions
of
which
substantive
law
is
applicable,
that
this
court
should
not
follow
that
rule.
this
court
should
enunciate
a
rule,
such
as
found
in
the
federal
rule
of
civil
procedures
to
reach
just
median
inexpensive
determination
of
the
litigation
on
the
merits.
there
should
be
a
rule
which
determines
these
questions
of
jurisdiction
applicable
substantive
law
without
regard
to
metaphysical
phrase
such
as,
where
causes
of
action
arise
or
where
torts
occur
or
where
the
impact
occurs.
this
language
which
is
found
in
the
longshoreman
and
harbor
workers'
compensation
cases,
we
say,
has
no
place
in
the
future
of
aviation
and
space
activities,
and
we
would
rest
primarily
on
the
decisions
of
the
third
circuit
in
weinstein
and
on
the
dissenting
court
in
judging
of
this
case.
thank
you.
