that
means
that
if
you
fly
from
new
york
or
washington
to
miami
or
palm
beach,
florida,
and
for
varying
times
you
are
under,

you
got
over

mr.
bostwick,
right
on
that,
you
have
this
one
of
your
important
premises,
if
not
major
premises
that
the
airplane
is
supplanting
sea
going
ships
as
the
major
means
of
transportation.
now
when
you
go
to
key
west
these
days
from
the
mainland
of
florida
you
travel
over
something
like
60-90
miles
that
was
once
traversed
by
boats.
now
there
is
a
great
causeway
and
you
are
over
the

not
just
over
an
ordinary
navigable
stream,
you
are
over
the
sea,
the
atlantic
ocean,
and
the
caribbean
and
the
gulf.
now
your
premise
would
certainly
make
an
automobile
which
hits
the
railing
and
goes
down
into

an
approach
to

that
would
bounce
the
airplane
off
of
potomac
and
on
dry
land
on
the
runway
if
it
missed
