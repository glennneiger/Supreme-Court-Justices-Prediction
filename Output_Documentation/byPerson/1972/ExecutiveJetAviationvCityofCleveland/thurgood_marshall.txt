justice

assuming
that
this
automobile
goes
over
the
rail
as
a
result
of
an
accident,
being
struck
by
another
automobile,
which
law
would
apply?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
assuming
that
the
law
--
the
car
was
going
over
the
state’s
speed
limit,
you
can't
apply
that
in
navigable
water?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
what
law
would
apply?
justice
thurgood
marshall
to
the
automobile
accident
up
on
the
bridge?
justice
thurgood
marshall
yeah,
but
the
accident
occurred
up
on
the
bridge
and
he
struck
it
and
as
a
result
of
being
struck
by
the
other
car,
he
went
over
into
the
navigable
water.
now,
whose
is
at
fault?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
it
certainly
wouldn't
be
decided
whether
or
not
there
is
grease
on
the
step,
to
maybe
on
the
seaworthy,
but
you
couldn't
decide
it
on
that
case.
