mr.
warren
k.
kaplan
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
several
years
ago
in
a
law
review
article
written
on
the
subject
of
police
external
review
boards,
a
then
judge
of
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
made
mention
of
the
omnipresent
of
review
mechanisms
at
every
level
of
our
complex
form
of
government,
even
at
the
level
of
judiciary.
he
said,
“given
the
supreme
court
is
not
fully
immune
for
in
common
with
all
judges
they
are
at
the
mercy
of
the
most
cold
blooded
external
review
ever
devised
by
man.”
i
refer
to
the
law
professors
who
spent
six
months
doing
an
autopsy
on
an
appellate
opinion
often
written
under
pressure
in
four
or
five
days.
mr.
chief
justice
i
do
not
know
what
case,
if
any,
you
had
in
mind
when
you
wrote
those
words
but
it
is
certainly
applicable
to
monroe
versus
pape.
for
under
12
years
that
have
elapse
since
that
decisions
of
printers
inc.
and
particularly
in
the
two
or
three
years,
there
has
been
a
continuing
barrage
of
criticism
in
the
law
reviews
aimed
at
that
portion
of
the
decision
which
held
that
a
city
is
not
a
person
within
the
meaning
of
section
1983.
the
latest
addition
to
that
volume
of
criticism
appeared
too
recently
bring
conclusion
in
our
brief
and
i
would
like
to
cite
the
court
to
it
at
this
time.
it
is
a
comment
in
the
university
of
virginia
law
review,
volume
58
commencing
at
page
143
which
takes
as
it's
text
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case
and
which
is
entitled
perhaps
somewhat
over
enthusiastically
carter
versus
carlson
the
monroe
doctrine
at
bay.
mr.
warren
k.
kaplan
yes
sir.
now
the
essence
of
these
several
law
review
articles
which
are
cited
in
our
brief
is
essentially
three-fold.
in
the
first
place,
it
has
been
pointed
out
that
the
historical
analysis
which
underlay
this
court's
decision
in
monroe,
misconstrued
the
significance
of
the
legislative
history
of
the
sherman
amendment.
secondly,
it
has
been
pointed
out
that
in
the
subsequent
cases
of
the
lower
courts
and
indeed
of
this
court,
the
monroe
holding
has
been
departed
from,
has
been
eroded
by
the
many
cases
which
have
granted
equitable
relief
against
municipalities
and
finally
it
has
been
pointed
out
and
we
concur
in
this
suggestion
that
if
it
is
open
for
the
court
to
reexamine
its
holding
in
monroe,
then
all
of
the
relevant
policy
considerations
militate
toward
a
different
finding
and
that
is,
that
a
city
is
a
person
within
the
meaning
of
1983.
now
if
the
court
--
i
should
come
back
to
those
points
in
just
a
moment,
if
this
court
notwithstanding
these
considerations
should
decline
to
reexamine
its
holding
in
monroe
at
this
time
then
we
say
that
nevertheless
decision
of
the
court
below
should
be
affirmed
because
monroe
is
distinguishable
for
the
various
reasons
that
were
set
forth
in
the
opinion
of
the
court
below.
that
is
the
rational
of
monroe
is
inapplicable
to
municipalities
which
are
not
immune
under
local
law
and
secondly
that
the
district
of
columbia
is
a
unique
entity.
but
those
arguments
i
would
prefer
to
leave
for
my
brief.
they
have
been
dealt
with
extensively
there
and
in
the
opinion
of
the
court
below
and
i
would
like
to
discuss
at
this
time
the
reasons
for
reexamining
monroe
as
a
whole.
let
me
respond
first
to
the
question
raised
by
mr.
justice
stewart
a
few
moments
ago
as
to
whether
the
district
of
columbia
is
in
fact
involved
in
section
1983.
i
think
that
this
court
disposed
of
that
question
in
hurd
versus
hodge
which
was
a
1947
decision.
it
was
a
companion
case
to
shelley
versus
kraemer,
and
it
held
that
the
district
was
a
state
of
territory
within
the
meaning
of
section
1983.
i
don’t
believe
that
there
has
been
any
question
about
that
in
any
case
since
that
time.
there
had
been
a
couple
of
lower
court
cases
which
have
repeated
that
statement
since
then
one
is
sewell
versus
pegelow
a
forth
circuit
case
found
a
291
f.2d,
page
196.
mr.
warren
k.
kaplan
no,
it
is
not
your
honor.
mr.
warren
k.
kaplan
i’m
sorry
your
honor
i
don’t
remember
the
citation.
mr.
warren
k.
kaplan
hurd
versus
hodge,
1947
and
followed,
it
was
the
very
next
case
in
the
us
reports
after
shelley
versus
kraemer.
mr.
warren
k.
kaplan
oh,
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
warren
k.
kaplan
thank
you.
mr.
warren
k.
kaplan
the
other
case
is
sewell
versus
pegelow
a
decision
of
the
fourth
circuit
291
f.
2nd,
page
196.
mr.
warren
k.
kaplan
yes
sir.
mr.
warren
k.
kaplan
i
do
not
recall
that
there
were
in
that
point
because
if
had
ever
been
raised.
finally
i
turn
briefly
to
the
legislative
history
which
i
think
is
very
important
in
this
case.
this
court
predicated
its
holding
in
monroe
virtually
exclusively
on
the
legislative
history
of
1983
and
the
sherman
amendment.
subsequent
research
has
indicated
that
historical
analysis
misconstrued
the
significance
of
the
sherman
amendment
and
of
the
matters
that
were
put
forth
in
debate
in
the
sherman
amendment.
now
if
one
reads
the
legislative,
the
congressional
globe
of
1971
and
the
measure
which
is
here
onto
discussion
that
is
1983
and
its
amendments
takes
up
virtually
the
entire
first
session
of
the
42nd
congress
more
than
some
500
pages
of
6
point,
type
3
columns
to
the
page.
if
one
reached
through
that
considerable
literature,
one
comes
to
two
rather
significant
conclusions.
the
first
is
that
when
the
congress
was
debating
what
is
now
section
1983
itself,
it
never
mentioned
municipal
liability.
and
the
second
is
that
when
it
discussed
the
sherman
amendment
in
which
context
it
did
discussed
municipal
liability
it
was
talking
about
something
very
different
from
what
was
involved
into
1983
and
the
principal
objections
to
the
sherman
amendment
are
not
applicable
to
the
consideration
of
municipal
liability
under
1983.
now
1983
was
first
discussed
on
march
25,
1871
and
i
must
take
a
moment
to
go
into
this
history
in
some
detail.
this
was
pursuant
to
a
message
from
president
grant
that
was
received
on
march
23
of
that
year
urging
the
congress
to
enact
some
effectual
legislation
to
vindicate
fourteenth
amendment
rights.
from
march
25
for
a
period
of
several
days,
approximately
10
days
from
march
25,
1983
itself
was
discussed
a
great
length
in
the
house
and
it
was
finally
passed
in
the
house
with
no
mention
whatever
of
municipal
liability.
it
then
went
to
the
senate
t
here
it
was
again
discussed
for
several
days
with
no
mention
of
municipal
liability.
on
april
15,
just
before
the
vote
came
in
the
senate,
the
so-called
sherman
amendment
which
would
have
imposed
riot
damage
liability
on
municipalities
without
fault,
that
amendment
was
added
just
before
the
vote
came
there
was
no
debate
root
came
there
was
no
debate
and
the
amendment
--
the
sherman
amendment
and
1983
itself
was
passed
by
the
senate.
so
that
on
april
15,
after
nearly
20
days
of
debate,
1983
without
the
sherman
amendment
in
the
house,
with
the
sherman
amendment
in
the
senate
had
been
passed
by
both
branches
without
any
debate
whatever
on
municipal
liability.
it
was
only
after
that
point
when
it
went
back
to
the
house
that
there
ensued
the
vigorous
debate
over
the
sherman
amendment
and
the
essence
of
the
opposition
to
the
sherman
amendment
was
not
any
hostility
to
the
idea
of
municipal
liability
per
se.
rather
it
was
hostility
to
the
idea
of
municipal
liability
without
fault.
representative
kerr
one
of
the
most
articulate
opponents
of
the
sherman
amendment
made
it
very
clear
on
april
19
at
page
788
of
the
congressional
globe
when
he
said
of
course
in
effect,
that
of
course
there
would
be
no
objection
to
the
this
bill
if
it
merely
imposed
liability
for
a
breach
of
a
duty
which
a
municipality
had
and
he
pointed
to
examples
which
existed
at
the
time
of
municipal
liability
for
failure
to
repair
streets
or
bridges,
whether
it
was
a
duty.
in
fact,
he
even
said
there
would
be
no
objection
to
municipal
liability
for
riot
damage
if
there
were
some
fault
involved,
if
it
were
required
and
he
--
and
there
were
other
statutes
in
existence
at
this
time,
of
this
nature
in
new
york,
maryland
and
pennsylvania.
if
they
were
fault
on
the
part
of
the
municipal
officials,
the
maryland
statute
at
the
time
i
believe
provided
that
there
will
be
liability
for
riot
damage
if
the
municipal
authorities
had
noticed
that
the
riot
was
going
to
occur
and
had
it
within
their
power
to
prevent
it
and
did
nothing.
in
that
situation,
municipal
liability
would
have
been
alright
and
in
fact
on
april
20
when
1983
was
finally
passed
in
the
house
it
was
with
a
substitution
for
the
sherman
amendment
which
was
consistent
with
representative
kerr's
feelings.
that
substitution
is
now
section
1986,
the
so
called
“passive
accomplice
provision”
which
provides
that
if
anyone
is
aware
that
a
deprivation
of
civil
rights
is
going
to
take
place
and
takes
no
steps
to
prevent
it,
but
has
it
in
its
power
to
prevent
it
or
aid
in
preventing
it
then
he
too
is
liable.
mr.
warren
k.
kaplan
as
mr.
barton
volunteered
i
too
would
volunteer
if
the
court
wishes
supplementary
memorandum
on
this
point.
mr.
warren
k.
kaplan
the
civil
rights
commission
your
honor
in
1966
i
believe
did
suggest,
the
us
commission
on
civil
rights
did
suggest
that
legislation
should
be
passed
so
as
to
make
municipalities
liable
for
1983
deprivations.
i
do
not
that
know
that
there
has
been
any
action
on
the
part
of
congress
to
do
that,
but
of
course
as
this
court
has
pointed
out
on
various
occasions
--
mr.
warren
k.
kaplan
i
am
not
aware
of
any,
your
honor,
but
since
the
exemption
of
municipalities
came
about
as
a
result
of
a
judicial
decision
by
this
court
i
would
think
that
the
reinstatement
of
municipalities
as
proper
defendants
could
come
about
by
the
same
route.
although
legislation
would
certainly
be
welcome
i
do
not
think
that
in
this
case
it
would
be
necessary.
well,
i
would
like
to
come
back
just
for
a
moment
to
the
legislative
history
and
what
is
now
section
1986
which
was
the
substitution
for
the
sherman
amendment.
we
have
a
statute
which
imposes
liability
where
there
is
fault,
where
there
is
knowledge
that
a
deprivation
is
going
to
occur
and
the
defendant
is
in
a
position
where
he
could
aid
or
he
could
prevent
or
aid
in
preventing
the
deprivation
and
there
is
their
liability.
that
meets
the
objection
to
the
sherman
amendment
that
representative
kerr
felt
was
so
important.
so
that
the
--
that
substitution
is
i
think
consistent
with
the
notion
that
there
should
be
liability
where
there
is
fault.
it
is
consistent
with
the
notion
that
in
municipality
maybe
a
person
within
the
meaning
of
section
1983.
since
this
court's
decision
in
monroe
as
counsel
has
pointed
out,
there
have
been
several
circuits,
the
fourth,
the
fifth,
the
seventh,
the
tenth
which
have
notwithstanding
the
very
clear
mandate
of
this
court
in
footnote
50
to
monroe
which
has
stated
that
“a
municipality
may
nevertheless
be
a
person
for
1983
purposes
where
equitable
relief
is
sought.”
this
court
has
in
fact
indicated
its
approval
of
that
distinction
in
the
subsequent
cases
of
turner
versus
city
of
memphis,
tinker
versus
des
moines
that
mcneese
versus
board
of
education
in
which
without
discussing
the
point,
the
court
implicitly
approved
the
granting
of
equitable
relief
against
the
state
subdivisions.
i
think
that
the
attempts
made
by
some
commentators
to
rationalize
this
distinction
between
the
granting
of
equitable
relief
and
the
granting
of
damages
cannot
withstand
close
analysis.
now
the
rationalization
that
is
most
often
put
forth
is
that
equitable
relief
involves
a
lesser
threat
to
the
municipal
treasury,
and
therefore,
a
municipality
maybe
a
person
for
equitable
purposes
where
it
would
not
be
if
the
claim
were
for
damages,
but
the
problem
with
that
distinction,
the
problems
are
three-fold.
first
of
all,
it
is
inconsistent
with
1983
itself
which
expressly
says
that
“where
there
is
--
where
you
have
a
person
who
is
depriving
another
person
of
his
fourteenth
amendment
rights,
he
shall
be
liable
in
an
action
for
damages
or
equitable
relief
or
any
other
proper
proceeding.
secondly,
it
is
inconsistent
with
the
facts
of
the
matter,
the
fact
of
the
matter
being,
an
equitable
relief
may
frequently
involve
the
expenditure
of
very
large
sums
of
money,
much
more
than
are
ought
to
be
involved
in
an
action
for
damages.
for
example,
in
the
case
of
harkless
versus
sweeney
independent
school,
which
came
before
this
term
--
before
this
court
last
term
in
which
the
court
denied
certiorari.
that
--
there
was
an
action
by
ten
black
school
teachers
for
reinstatement
and
back
pay
under
section
1983.
they
have
been
out
of
work
for
some
five
years
and
the
fifth
circuit
granted
reinstatement
and
back
pay
under
the
guise
of
granting
equitable
relief.
although
the
payment
of
some
--
several
hundred
thousand
dollars
was
potentially
involved.
in
the
case
of
griffin
versus
prince
edward
county,
i
don’t
believe
that
came
up
under
1983,
but
it
was
an
example
of
the
granting
of
equitable
relief
at
enormous
cost
to
the
state
subdivision
where
this
court
ordered
the
prince
edward
county
schools
to
be
reopened.
finally,
this
distinction
between
equitable
relief
and
legal
relief
is
inconsistent
with
the
statements
of
this
court
in
the
bevins
case
decided
last
term
in
which
the
court
indicated
that
where
there
is
jurisdiction
to
grant
equitable
relief
there
ought
also
to
be
jurisdiction
to
grant
legal
relief.
i
think
that
the
proposition
that
we
are
contending
for
that
is
that
the
court
upon
reexamining
its
holding
in
monroe
should
conclude
that
a
municipality
is
or
maybe
a
person
within
the
meaning
of
1983
is
consistent
not
only
with
the
legislative
history
and
not
only
with
the
subsequent
post
monroe
cases
granting
equitable
relief.
it
is
also
consistent
with
the
overall
purpose
of
1983
as
expressed
by
president
grant
and
with
contemporary
notions
of
social
justice.
we
no
longer
believe
as
people
did
200
years
ago
in
the
case
of
russell
versus
men
of
devon
that
it
is
better
for
an
individual
to
suffer
an
injury
than
for
the
public
to
suffer
something
inconvenience.
contemporary
notions
of
risk
spreading
are
so
well
entrenched
that
just
within
the
last
dozen
years,
since
monroe,
in
some
27
jurisdictions,
the
doctrine
of
sovereign
immunity
has
been
partially
or
wholly
abrogated
either
judicially
or
through
legislation.
and
in
some
nine
other
jurisdictions,
municipalities
maybe
liable
in
action
to
damages
where
they
have
insurance
and
all
that
has
occurred
just
almost
entirely
since
this
court's
decision
in
monroe.
finally,
municipal
liability
is
essential
if
we
are
to
achieve
the
two-fold
objectives
of
deterrence
of
police
misconduct
and
compensation
for
that
misconduct
when
it
occurs.
police
misconduct
as
was
pointed
out
by
the
us
commission
on
civil
rights
in
1961
has
been
and
continues
to
be
a
very
serious
problem
in
this
country.
in
fact
just
a
few
weeks
ago
there
came
across
my
desk
in
american
bar
association
report,
the
tentative
draft
of
standards
relating
to
the
urban
police
function
which
says,
“the
continuing
failure
to
devise
and
implement
necessary
procedures
and
sanctions
to
deal
with
police
abuses
is
one
of
the
most
critical
problems
now
confronting
our
society.”
and
that
is
not
the
american
civil
liberties
union
talking
or
the
us
commission
on
civil
rights,
that
is
the
american
bar
association.
mr.
warren
k.
kaplan
well
i
think
not.
i
believe
they
are
your
honor
concerned
with
the
rights
of
third
person
(inaudible)
mr.
warren
k.
kaplan
well
i
believe
they
are
concerned
with
that
too,
but
i
think
it
is
clear
that
they
are
also
concerned
with
tort
liability
to
third
persons
because
they
go
on
to
urge
that
sovereign
immunity
should
be
abrogated
by
judicial
decision
where
it
still
remains.
i
think
they
are
concerned
with
all
of
those
purposes.
of
course
as
far
as
compensation
is
concerned
there
can
be
no
meaningful
compensation
for
victims
of
police
brutality
without
municipal
liability.
this
court
in
mapp
versus
ohio
and
the
fourth
circuit
in
lankford
versus
gelstonin
and
other
courts
in
other
cases
have
taken
judicial
notice
of
the
fact
that
policeman
are
notoriously
unsatisfactory
defendants.
that
they
are
habitually
and
incorrigibly
judgment
proof.
when
they
can
be
found
and
this
case
presents
to
another
example
of
why
they
are
unsatisfactory
defendants,
for
in
this
case,
the
defendant
john
carlson
who
on
august
19th
put
on
a
pair
of
brass
knuckles
and
beat
the
plaintiff's
face
into
a
bloody
pulp
has
not
even
been
found
for
service
of
process.
so
that
there
frequently
can
be
no
compensation
for
victims
of
police
brutality
without
municipal
liability
and
that
has
been
pointed
out
by
a
vast
number
of
commentators.
well,
i
would
say
finally
that
another
reason
for
imposing
the
municipal
liability
is
that
which
is
put
forth
by
judge
nickels
in
his
concurring
opinion
in
this
case.
and
that
is
to
give
some
protection
to
the
policeman
so
that
the
policeman
will
know
that
he
does
not
any
longer
stand
alone,
that
he
has
a
municipality
on
his
side
to
provide
a
defense
for
him.
i
believe
that
all
of
these
relevant
--
all
of
the
relevant
policy
considerations
point
unequivocally
to
the
imposition
of
municipal
liability.
i
see
that
my
time
has
all
but
expired
and
i
would
like
to
leave
the
court
with
one
further
thought
and
that
is
this.
in
the
--
for
more
than
a
century
now
the
paper
promises
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
have
for
very
many
of
our
citizens
in
many
parts
of
this
country
and
in
many
aspects
of
your
lives,
particularly
where
police
misconduct
is
concerned,
have
remained
essentially
that,
that
is
paper
promises.
in
this
case
at
this
time
this
court
has
a
rare
opportunity,
the
first
such
opportunity
since
monroe
v.
pape
was
argued
12
years
ago
this
week,
to
transform
those
paper
promises
into
meaningful
reality.
now
i
know
that
mr.
carter,
the
respondent
in
this
case
who
sits
in
the
back
of
this
room
today
has
not
fully
understood
all
of
the
dialog
that
has
just
transpired
filled
as
it
unavoidably
was
will
legal,
with
complex
abstractions
and
jargon
of
our
profession.
but
he
and
the
hundreds
of
melvin
caters
across
this
land
will
understand
the
impact
of
this
court's
decision
and
it
is
on
his
and
their
behalf
that
i
most
earnestly
and
respectfully
urge
this
court
not
to
let
this
opportunity
putting
teeth
into
the
fourteenth
amendment
pass,
to
pass
un-exercised.
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
warren
k.
kaplan
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
several
years
ago
in
a
law
review
article
written
on
the
subject
of
police
external
review
boards,
a
then
judge
of
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
made
mention
of
the
omnipresent
of
review
mechanisms
at
every
level
of
our
complex
form
of
government,
even
at
the
level
of
judiciary.
he
said,
“given
the
supreme
court
is
not
fully
immune
for
in
common
with
all
judges
they
are
at
the
mercy
of
the
most
cold
blooded
external
review
ever
devised
by
man.”
i
refer
to
the
law
professors
who
spent
six
months
doing
an
autopsy
on
an
appellate
opinion
often
written
under
pressure
in
four
or
five
days.
mr.
chief
justice
i
do
not
know
what
case,
if
any,
you
had
in
mind
when
you
wrote
those
words
but
it
is
certainly
applicable
to
monroe
versus
pape.
for
under
12
years
that
have
elapse
since
that
decisions
of
printers
inc.
and
particularly
in
the
two
or
three
years,
there
has
been
a
continuing
barrage
of
criticism
in
the
law
reviews
aimed
at
that
portion
of
the
decision
which
held
that
a
city
is
not
a
person
within
the
meaning
of
section
1983.
the
latest
addition
to
that
volume
of
criticism
appeared
too
recently
bring
conclusion
in
our
brief
and
i
would
like
to
cite
the
court
to
it
at
this
time.
it
is
a
comment
in
the
university
of
virginia
law
review,
volume
58
commencing
at
page
143
which
takes
as
it's
text
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case
and
which
is
entitled
perhaps
somewhat
over
enthusiastically
carter
versus
carlson
the
monroe
doctrine
at
bay.
mr.
warren
k.
kaplan
yes
sir.
now
the
essence
of
these
several
law
review
articles
which
are
cited
in
our
brief
is
essentially
three-fold.
in
the
first
place,
it
has
been
pointed
out
that
the
historical
analysis
which
underlay
this
court's
decision
in
monroe,
misconstrued
the
significance
of
the
legislative
history
of
the
sherman
amendment.
secondly,
it
has
been
pointed
out
that
in
the
subsequent
cases
of
the
lower
courts
and
indeed
of
this
court,
the
monroe
holding
has
been
departed
from,
has
been
eroded
by
the
many
cases
which
have
granted
equitable
relief
against
municipalities
and
finally
it
has
been
pointed
out
and
we
concur
in
this
suggestion
that
if
it
is
open
for
the
court
to
reexamine
its
holding
in
monroe,
then
all
of
the
relevant
policy
considerations
militate
toward
a
different
finding
and
that
is,
that
a
city
is
a
person
within
the
meaning
of
1983.
now
if
the
court
--
i
should
come
back
to
those
points
in
just
a
moment,
if
this
court
notwithstanding
these
considerations
should
decline
to
reexamine
its
holding
in
monroe
at
this
time
then
we
say
that
nevertheless
decision
of
the
court
below
should
be
affirmed
because
monroe
is
distinguishable
for
the
various
reasons
that
were
set
forth
in
the
opinion
of
the
court
below.
that
is
the
rational
of
monroe
is
inapplicable
to
municipalities
which
are
not
immune
under
local
law
and
secondly
that
the
district
of
columbia
is
a
unique
entity.
but
those
arguments
i
would
prefer
to
leave
for
my
brief.
they
have
been
dealt
with
extensively
there
and
in
the
opinion
of
the
court
below
and
i
would
like
to
discuss
at
this
time
the
reasons
for
reexamining
monroe
as
a
whole.
let
me
respond
first
to
the
question
raised
by
mr.
justice
stewart
a
few
moments
ago
as
to
whether
the
district
of
columbia
is
in
fact
involved
in
section
1983.
i
think
that
this
court
disposed
of
that
question
in
hurd
versus
hodge
which
was
a
1947
decision.
it
was
a
companion
case
to
shelley
versus
kraemer,
and
it
held
that
the
district
was
a
state
of
territory
within
the
meaning
of
section
1983.
i
don’t
believe
that
there
has
been
any
question
about
that
in
any
case
since
that
time.
there
had
been
a
couple
of
lower
court
cases
which
have
repeated
that
statement
since
then
one
is
sewell
versus
pegelow
a
forth
circuit
case
found
a
291
f.2d,
page
196.
mr.
warren
k.
kaplan
no,
it
is
not
your
honor.
mr.
warren
k.
kaplan
i’m
sorry
your
honor
i
don’t
remember
the
citation.
mr.
warren
k.
kaplan
hurd
versus
hodge,
1947
and
followed,
it
was
the
very
next
case
in
the
us
reports
after
shelley
versus
kraemer.
mr.
warren
k.
kaplan
oh,
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
warren
k.
kaplan
thank
you.
mr.
warren
k.
kaplan
the
other
case
is
sewell
versus
pegelow
a
decision
of
the
fourth
circuit
291
f.
2nd,
page
196.
mr.
warren
k.
kaplan
yes
sir.
mr.
warren
k.
kaplan
i
do
not
recall
that
there
were
in
that
point
because
if
had
ever
been
raised.
finally
i
turn
briefly
to
the
legislative
history
which
i
think
is
very
important
in
this
case.
this
court
predicated
its
holding
in
monroe
virtually
exclusively
on
the
legislative
history
of
1983
and
the
sherman
amendment.
subsequent
research
has
indicated
that
historical
analysis
misconstrued
the
significance
of
the
sherman
amendment
and
of
the
matters
that
were
put
forth
in
debate
in
the
sherman
amendment.
now
if
one
reads
the
legislative,
the
congressional
globe
of
1971
and
the
measure
which
is
here
onto
discussion
that
is
1983
and
its
amendments
takes
up
virtually
the
entire
first
session
of
the
42nd
congress
more
than
some
500
pages
of
6
point,
type
3
columns
to
the
page.
if
one
reached
through
that
considerable
literature,
one
comes
to
two
rather
significant
conclusions.
the
first
is
that
when
the
congress
was
debating
what
is
now
section
1983
itself,
it
never
mentioned
municipal
liability.
and
the
second
is
that
when
it
discussed
the
sherman
amendment
in
which
context
it
did
discussed
municipal
liability
it
was
talking
about
something
very
different
from
what
was
involved
into
1983
and
the
principal
objections
to
the
sherman
amendment
are
not
applicable
to
the
consideration
of
municipal
liability
under
1983.
now
1983
was
first
discussed
on
march
25,
1871
and
i
must
take
a
moment
to
go
into
this
history
in
some
detail.
this
was
pursuant
to
a
message
from
president
grant
that
was
received
on
march
23
of
that
year
urging
the
congress
to
enact
some
effectual
legislation
to
vindicate
fourteenth
amendment
rights.
from
march
25
for
a
period
of
several
days,
approximately
10
days
from
march
25,
1983
itself
was
discussed
a
great
length
in
the
house
and
it
was
finally
passed
in
the
house
with
no
mention
whatever
of
municipal
liability.
it
then
went
to
the
senate
t
here
it
was
again
discussed
for
several
days
with
no
mention
of
municipal
liability.
on
april
15,
just
before
the
vote
came
in
the
senate,
the
so-called
sherman
amendment
which
would
have
imposed
riot
damage
liability
on
municipalities
without
fault,
that
amendment
was
added
just
before
the
vote
came
there
was
no
debate
root
came
there
was
no
debate
and
the
amendment
--
the
sherman
amendment
and
1983
itself
was
passed
by
the
senate.
so
that
on
april
15,
after
nearly
20
days
of
debate,
1983
without
the
sherman
amendment
in
the
house,
with
the
sherman
amendment
in
the
senate
had
been
passed
by
both
branches
without
any
debate
whatever
on
municipal
liability.
it
was
only
after
that
point
when
it
went
back
to
the
house
that
there
ensued
the
vigorous
debate
over
the
sherman
amendment
and
the
essence
of
the
opposition
to
the
sherman
amendment
was
not
any
hostility
to
the
idea
of
municipal
liability
per
se.
rather
it
was
hostility
to
the
idea
of
municipal
liability
without
fault.
representative
kerr
one
of
the
most
articulate
opponents
of
the
sherman
amendment
made
it
very
clear
on
april
19
at
page
788
of
the
congressional
globe
when
he
said
of
course
in
effect,
that
of
course
there
would
be
no
objection
to
the
this
bill
if
it
merely
imposed
liability
for
a
breach
of
a
duty
which
a
municipality
had
and
he
pointed
to
examples
which
existed
at
the
time
of
municipal
liability
for
failure
to
repair
streets
or
bridges,
whether
it
was
a
duty.
in
fact,
he
even
said
there
would
be
no
objection
to
municipal
liability
for
riot
damage
if
there
were
some
fault
involved,
if
it
were
required
and
he
--
and
there
were
other
statutes
in
existence
at
this
time,
of
this
nature
in
new
york,
maryland
and
pennsylvania.
if
they
were
fault
on
the
part
of
the
municipal
officials,
the
maryland
statute
at
the
time
i
believe
provided
that
there
will
be
liability
for
riot
damage
if
the
municipal
authorities
had
noticed
that
the
riot
was
going
to
occur
and
had
it
within
their
power
to
prevent
it
and
did
nothing.
in
that
situation,
municipal
liability
would
have
been
alright
and
in
fact
on
april
20
when
1983
was
finally
passed
in
the
house
it
was
with
a
substitution
for
the
sherman
amendment
which
was
consistent
with
representative
kerr's
feelings.
that
substitution
is
now
section
1986,
the
so
called
“passive
accomplice
provision”
which
provides
that
if
anyone
is
aware
that
a
deprivation
of
civil
rights
is
going
to
take
place
and
takes
no
steps
to
prevent
it,
but
has
it
in
its
power
to
prevent
it
or
aid
in
preventing
it
then
he
too
is
liable.
mr.
warren
k.
kaplan
as
mr.
barton
volunteered
i
too
would
volunteer
if
the
court
wishes
supplementary
memorandum
on
this
point.
mr.
warren
k.
kaplan
the
civil
rights
commission
your
honor
in
1966
i
believe
did
suggest,
the
us
commission
on
civil
rights
did
suggest
that
legislation
should
be
passed
so
as
to
make
municipalities
liable
for
1983
deprivations.
i
do
not
that
know
that
there
has
been
any
action
on
the
part
of
congress
to
do
that,
but
of
course
as
this
court
has
pointed
out
on
various
occasions
--
mr.
warren
k.
kaplan
i
am
not
aware
of
any,
your
honor,
but
since
the
exemption
of
municipalities
came
about
as
a
result
of
a
judicial
decision
by
this
court
i
would
think
that
the
reinstatement
of
municipalities
as
proper
defendants
could
come
about
by
the
same
route.
although
legislation
would
certainly
be
welcome
i
do
not
think
that
in
this
case
it
would
be
necessary.
well,
i
would
like
to
come
back
just
for
a
moment
to
the
legislative
history
and
what
is
now
section
1986
which
was
the
substitution
for
the
sherman
amendment.
we
have
a
statute
which
imposes
liability
where
there
is
fault,
where
there
is
knowledge
that
a
deprivation
is
going
to
occur
and
the
defendant
is
in
a
position
where
he
could
aid
or
he
could
prevent
or
aid
in
preventing
the
deprivation
and
there
is
their
liability.
that
meets
the
objection
to
the
sherman
amendment
that
representative
kerr
felt
was
so
important.
so
that
the
--
that
substitution
is
i
think
consistent
with
the
notion
that
there
should
be
liability
where
there
is
fault.
it
is
consistent
with
the
notion
that
in
municipality
maybe
a
person
within
the
meaning
of
section
1983.
since
this
court's
decision
in
monroe
as
counsel
has
pointed
out,
there
have
been
several
circuits,
the
fourth,
the
fifth,
the
seventh,
the
tenth
which
have
notwithstanding
the
very
clear
mandate
of
this
court
in
footnote
50
to
monroe
which
has
stated
that
“a
municipality
may
nevertheless
be
a
person
for
1983
purposes
where
equitable
relief
is
sought.”
this
court
has
in
fact
indicated
its
approval
of
that
distinction
in
the
subsequent
cases
of
turner
versus
city
of
memphis,
tinker
versus
des
moines
that
mcneese
versus
board
of
education
in
which
without
discussing
the
point,
the
court
implicitly
approved
the
granting
of
equitable
relief
against
the
state
subdivisions.
i
think
that
the
attempts
made
by
some
commentators
to
rationalize
this
distinction
between
the
granting
of
equitable
relief
and
the
granting
of
damages
cannot
withstand
close
analysis.
now
the
rationalization
that
is
most
often
put
forth
is
that
equitable
relief
involves
a
lesser
threat
to
the
municipal
treasury,
and
therefore,
a
municipality
maybe
a
person
for
equitable
purposes
where
it
would
not
be
if
the
claim
were
for
damages,
but
the
problem
with
that
distinction,
the
problems
are
three-fold.
first
of
all,
it
is
inconsistent
with
1983
itself
which
expressly
says
that
“where
there
is
--
where
you
have
a
person
who
is
depriving
another
person
of
his
fourteenth
amendment
rights,
he
shall
be
liable
in
an
action
for
damages
or
equitable
relief
or
any
other
proper
proceeding.
secondly,
it
is
inconsistent
with
the
facts
of
the
matter,
the
fact
of
the
matter
being,
an
equitable
relief
may
frequently
involve
the
expenditure
of
very
large
sums
of
money,
much
more
than
are
ought
to
be
involved
in
an
action
for
damages.
for
example,
in
the
case
of
harkless
versus
sweeney
independent
school,
which
came
before
this
term
--
before
this
court
last
term
in
which
the
court
denied
certiorari.
that
--
there
was
an
action
by
ten
black
school
teachers
for
reinstatement
and
back
pay
under
section
1983.
they
have
been
out
of
work
for
some
five
years
and
the
fifth
circuit
granted
reinstatement
and
back
pay
under
the
guise
of
granting
equitable
relief.
although
the
payment
of
some
--
several
hundred
thousand
dollars
was
potentially
involved.
in
the
case
of
griffin
versus
prince
edward
county,
i
don’t
believe
that
came
up
under
1983,
but
it
was
an
example
of
the
granting
of
equitable
relief
at
enormous
cost
to
the
state
subdivision
where
this
court
ordered
the
prince
edward
county
schools
to
be
reopened.
finally,
this
distinction
between
equitable
relief
and
legal
relief
is
inconsistent
with
the
statements
of
this
court
in
the
bevins
case
decided
last
term
in
which
the
court
indicated
that
where
there
is
jurisdiction
to
grant
equitable
relief
there
ought
also
to
be
jurisdiction
to
grant
legal
relief.
i
think
that
the
proposition
that
we
are
contending
for
that
is
that
the
court
upon
reexamining
its
holding
in
monroe
should
conclude
that
a
municipality
is
or
maybe
a
person
within
the
meaning
of
1983
is
consistent
not
only
with
the
legislative
history
and
not
only
with
the
subsequent
post
monroe
cases
granting
equitable
relief.
it
is
also
consistent
with
the
overall
purpose
of
1983
as
expressed
by
president
grant
and
with
contemporary
notions
of
social
justice.
we
no
longer
believe
as
people
did
200
years
ago
in
the
case
of
russell
versus
men
of
devon
that
it
is
better
for
an
individual
to
suffer
an
injury
than
for
the
public
to
suffer
something
inconvenience.
contemporary
notions
of
risk
spreading
are
so
well
entrenched
that
just
within
the
last
dozen
years,
since
monroe,
in
some
27
jurisdictions,
the
doctrine
of
sovereign
immunity
has
been
partially
or
wholly
abrogated
either
judicially
or
through
legislation.
and
in
some
nine
other
jurisdictions,
municipalities
maybe
liable
in
action
to
damages
where
they
have
insurance
and
all
that
has
occurred
just
almost
entirely
since
this
court's
decision
in
monroe.
finally,
municipal
liability
is
essential
if
we
are
to
achieve
the
two-fold
objectives
of
deterrence
of
police
misconduct
and
compensation
for
that
misconduct
when
it
occurs.
police
misconduct
as
was
pointed
out
by
the
us
commission
on
civil
rights
in
1961
has
been
and
continues
to
be
a
very
serious
problem
in
this
country.
in
fact
just
a
few
weeks
ago
there
came
across
my
desk
in
american
bar
association
report,
the
tentative
draft
of
standards
relating
to
the
urban
police
function
which
says,
“the
continuing
failure
to
devise
and
implement
necessary
procedures
and
sanctions
to
deal
with
police
abuses
is
one
of
the
most
critical
problems
now
confronting
our
society.”
and
that
is
not
the
american
civil
liberties
union
talking
or
the
us
commission
on
civil
rights,
that
is
the
american
bar
association.
mr.
warren
k.
kaplan
well
i
think
not.
i
believe
they
are
your
honor
concerned
with
the
rights
of
third
person
(inaudible)
mr.
warren
k.
kaplan
well
i
believe
they
are
concerned
with
that
too,
but
i
think
it
is
clear
that
they
are
also
concerned
with
tort
liability
to
third
persons
because
they
go
on
to
urge
that
sovereign
immunity
should
be
abrogated
by
judicial
decision
where
it
still
remains.
i
think
they
are
concerned
with
all
of
those
purposes.
of
course
as
far
as
compensation
is
concerned
there
can
be
no
meaningful
compensation
for
victims
of
police
brutality
without
municipal
liability.
this
court
in
mapp
versus
ohio
and
the
fourth
circuit
in
lankford
versus
gelstonin
and
other
courts
in
other
cases
have
taken
judicial
notice
of
the
fact
that
policeman
are
notoriously
unsatisfactory
defendants.
that
they
are
habitually
and
incorrigibly
judgment
proof.
when
they
can
be
found
and
this
case
presents
to
another
example
of
why
they
are
unsatisfactory
defendants,
for
in
this
case,
the
defendant
john
carlson
who
on
august
19th
put
on
a
pair
of
brass
knuckles
and
beat
the
plaintiff's
face
into
a
bloody
pulp
has
not
even
been
found
for
service
of
process.
so
that
there
frequently
can
be
no
compensation
for
victims
of
police
brutality
without
municipal
liability
and
that
has
been
pointed
out
by
a
vast
number
of
commentators.
well,
i
would
say
finally
that
another
reason
for
imposing
the
municipal
liability
is
that
which
is
put
forth
by
judge
nickels
in
his
concurring
opinion
in
this
case.
and
that
is
to
give
some
protection
to
the
policeman
so
that
the
policeman
will
know
that
he
does
not
any
longer
stand
alone,
that
he
has
a
municipality
on
his
side
to
provide
a
defense
for
him.
i
believe
that
all
of
these
relevant
--
all
of
the
relevant
policy
considerations
point
unequivocally
to
the
imposition
of
municipal
liability.
i
see
that
my
time
has
all
but
expired
and
i
would
like
to
leave
the
court
with
one
further
thought
and
that
is
this.
in
the
--
for
more
than
a
century
now
the
paper
promises
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
have
for
very
many
of
our
citizens
in
many
parts
of
this
country
and
in
many
aspects
of
your
lives,
particularly
where
police
misconduct
is
concerned,
have
remained
essentially
that,
that
is
paper
promises.
in
this
case
at
this
time
this
court
has
a
rare
opportunity,
the
first
such
opportunity
since
monroe
v.
pape
was
argued
12
years
ago
this
week,
to
transform
those
paper
promises
into
meaningful
reality.
now
i
know
that
mr.
carter,
the
respondent
in
this
case
who
sits
in
the
back
of
this
room
today
has
not
fully
understood
all
of
the
dialog
that
has
just
transpired
filled
as
it
unavoidably
was
will
legal,
with
complex
abstractions
and
jargon
of
our
profession.
but
he
and
the
hundreds
of
melvin
caters
across
this
land
will
understand
the
impact
of
this
court's
decision
and
it
is
on
his
and
their
behalf
that
i
most
earnestly
and
respectfully
urge
this
court
not
to
let
this
opportunity
putting
teeth
into
the
fourteenth
amendment
pass,
to
pass
un-exercised.
thank
you
very
much.
