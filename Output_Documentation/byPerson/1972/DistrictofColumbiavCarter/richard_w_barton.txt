mr.
richard
w.
barton
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
question
which
is
before
the
court
in
this
case
is
whether
or
not
the
district
of
columbia,
a
congressionally
created
municipal
corporation
is
a
person
within
the
meaning
of
the
1871
civil
rights
act,
42
u.s.c.
1983.
the
court
below
answered
the
question
in
the
affirmative.
it
is
our
contention
that
it
should
be
answered
in
the
negative.
in
this
respect,
we
rely
upon
the
decision
of
this
court
in
monroe
versus
pape
in
a
host
of
circuit
court
decisions
elsewhere
throughout
the
country
and
upon
the
legislative
history
of
the
1871
civil
rights
act.
we
start
with
the
proposition
that
is
undisputed
and
that
is,
that
if
the
district
of
columbia
and
other
municipal
corporations
are
persons
within
the
meaning
of
the
1871
act,
it
is
because
and
only
because
the
congress
so
intended.
now,
this
court
in
1961
in
monroe
versus
pape
in
a
unanimous
opinion
on
this
point,
an
opinion
authored
by
mr.
justice
douglas,
expressly
held
as
we
read
the
opinion
that
congress
did
not
intend
municipalities
to
be
included
within
the
word
person
as
used
in
the
1871
act.
the
court
below
held
that
notwithstanding
monroe
versus
pape,
the
district
of
columbia
was
a
person
within
the
meaning
of
that
act
and
it
did
so
on
two
independent
grounds.
first,
that
monroe
versus
pape
did
not
hold
that
municipalities
were
not
persons
within
the
meaning
of
the
act
but
rather
held
that
they
were
persons
within
the
meaning
of
the
act,
but
that
municipalities
could
not
be
held
liable
in
damages
under
the
civil
rights
act
to
the
extent
that
they
were
immune
under
local
law.
now,
the
court
did
not
phrase
it
in
quite
that
way,
but
that
is
the
necessary
effect
of
the
court’s
holding
because
it
held
that
the
civil
rights
act,
the
word
person
as
used
in
that
the
act
did
encompass
the
district
of
columbia
which
is
indisputable
a
municipal
corporation.
in
reaching
the
decision
that
it
did,
the
court
relied
upon
the
legislative
history
of
the
1871
civil
rights
act
which
was
thoroughly
explored
by
this
court
in
its
opinion
in
monroe.
it
pointed
out
that
one
of
the
reasons,
one
of
the
principal
reasons
which
led
to
the
so-called
sherman
amendment
or
amendments,
there
were
two
of
them,
the
second
one
is
slightly
watered-down
version,
indicated
that
many
of
the
members
of
the
congress
were
then
concerned
with
whether
or
not
the
congress
could
consistent
with
the
constitution
imposed
liability
upon
municipal
corporations.
that
issue
was
very
hotly
argued.
some
took
the
position
that
it
could,
others
took
the
position
that
it
could
not,
but
when
the
congress
rejected
that
amendment,
the
sherman
amendment,
now
the
sherman
amendment
would
have
made
municipalities
liable
for
actions
within
their
borders
by
persons
riotously
and
tumultuously
assembled
together
which
was
a
clear
reference
to
the
ku
klux
klan
and
similar
organizations.
that
amendment
was
rejected.
some
i
think
projected
it
because
they
were
convinced
that
it
was
unconstitutional.
others
perhaps
rejected
it
because
they
thought
it
was
unwise.
perhaps
still
others
because
they
thought
it
was
both
unwise
and
unconstitutional,
but
the
amendment
was
clearly
rejected.
and
as
this
court
unanimously
concluded
in
monroe
versus
pape,
that
legislative
history
is
so
forceful
as
a
reflection
of
the
intent
of
congress
that
it
would
just
be
impossible
to
conclude
that
the
congress
intended
to
include
municipalities
within
the
meaning
of
the
term
person
as
it
used
it
in
that
act.
now,
one
of
the
things
that
the
court
below
relied
upon
was
the
argument
which
had
been
advanced
to
this
court
in
monroe
versus
pape
but
which
is
not
referred
to
in
its
opinion
and
that
is
that,
in
light
of
the
concern
of
congress
as
to
whether
or
not
it
could
impose
liabilities
on
municipalities
when
they
were
immune
under
local
law,
the
court
should
limit
the
--
its
holding,
the
one
that
it
eventually
made
in
monroe
versus
pape
to
a
holding
that
municipalities
are
liable
under
the
civil
rights
act
only
to
the
extent
that
they
are
liable
under
local
law.
now,
the
second
basis
for
the
lower
court’s
decision
was
a
utilization
of
1988
of
title
42.
now,
that
is
the
statute
which
permits
federal
courts
when
they
are
administering
federal
laws
and
this
would
include
1983
to
borrow
provisions
of
state
laws
to
assist
the
federal
court
in
implementing
a
right
which
is
given
by
a
federal
statute
or
the
federal
constitution.
but
what
the
court
below
has
done
here
is
not
utilized
section
1988
to
implement
a
right,
but
rather
to
create
a
right
which
under
this
court’s
decision
in
monroe
versus
pape
does
not
exist.
this
court
said
in
monroe
versus
pape
that
there
is
no
right
to
bring
an
action
for
damages
against
a
municipality
under
1983.
so
the
court
made
an
end-run
so
to
speak
around
that
and
said,
“but
you
can
borrow
local
law
and
if
local
law
provides
for
liability
then
you
can
adopt
that
liability
and
use
that
to
implement
the
nonexistent
remedy
that
you
have
against
the
municipality
under
1983.”
we
submit
that
that
is
just
not
sound
reasoning.
it
has
been
rejected
by
several
circuit
court
decisions,
two
in
the
seventh
circuit,
one
in
the
ninth
circuit,
since
the
decision
in
this
case
came
down.
those
decisions
are
--
the
latest
of
those
decisions
is
moor
versus
madigan
the
ninth
circuit
decision
which
discusses
the
two
slightly
earlier
seventh
circuit
decisions
that
is
--
it
was
decided
on
april
the
12th
of
this
year
and
was
reported
in
458
federal
2nd
at
1217.
the
second
ground
which
the
court
below
gave
for
holding
that
the
--
mr.
richard
w.
barton
no,
your
honor,
it
is
not.
it
was
decided
--
it
is
458
f
2nd
at
page
1217.
mr.
richard
w.
barton
moor
versus
madigan.
mr.
richard
w.
barton
there
are
two
second
circuit
court
--
seventh
circuit
court
decisions
and
those
are
both
cited
and
referred
to
in
the
moor
versus
madigan
case.
those
were
decided
in
october
and
november
of
1971.
the
second
independent
ground
that
the
court
used
for
finding
the
district
of
columbia
amenable
to
suit
under
the
civil
rights
act
was
that
the
legislative
history
of
the
act
indicated
again
that
the
congress
was
primarily
concerned
with
the
constitutionality
of
imposing
liability
upon
municipalities
and
that
that
reluctance
to
do
so
which
the
congress
gave
into
could
not
have
applied
to
the
district
of
columbia.
that
congress
under
the
constitution
has
plenary
jurisdiction
over
the
district
of
columbia
and
it
could
not
have
been
concerned
with
whether
or
not
it
could,
had
it
chose
to
do
so
impose
liability
upon
the
municipal
corporation
of
the
district
of
columbia.
that
of
course
is
quite
true
as
far
as
it
goes,
clearly
the
congress
could
have
done
that.
there
is
nothing
in
the
legislative
history
that
we
have
been
able
to
find
that
even
mentions
the
district
of
columbia
or
indicates
that
congress
was
in
anyway
concerned
about
the
district
of
columbia
or
the
applicability
of
the
act
to
the
district.
mr.
richard
w.
barton
there
are
cases
that
touch
on
that
point.
i
cannot
say
that
it
is
settled,
but
our
position
would
be
that
if
congress
had
given
thought
to
this,
it
would
perhaps
have
excluded
the
district
of
columbia
expressly.
mr.
richard
w.
barton
there
are
cases
which
hold
and
we
do
not
challenge
this
point
that
insofar
as
the
act
applies
to
employees,
that
is
officers
of
the
municipal
corporation,
it
is
operable
within
the
district
of
columbia.
mr.
richard
w.
barton
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
w.
barton
no,
i
do
not
think
there
is
your
honor
but
we
have
not
challenged
that
aspect
of
the
holding
and
we
will
not
cross
that
here.
mr.
richard
w.
barton
no,
he
does
not.
his
holding
as
we
understand
it
is
that
because
the
congress
could
not
have
been
concerned
about
its
authority
to
impose
liability
on
the
district
of
columbia
since
it
had
plenary
power
of
the
district
of
columbia,
it
intended
the
act
to
apply
to
the
district
of
columbia,
but
the
main
purpose
of
the
act
was
to
give
a
federal
remedy
in
a
federal
court.
mr.
richard
w.
barton
yes.
mr.
richard
w.
barton
yes,
but
the
only
court
then
in
the
district
of
columbia
was
a
federal
court.
mr.
richard
w.
barton
so
there
was
no
need
to
give
a
federal
remedy
in
a
federal
court.
if
you
had
any
remedy
at
all,
if
the
act
applied
in
the
district
of
columbia,
you
would
automatically
have
a
remedy
in
a
federal
court.
mr.
richard
w.
barton
yes
and
that
issue
was
not
--
mr.
richard
w.
barton
no,
i
do
not
think
it
is.
the
other
side
i
think
does
cite
two
cases
in
which
they
say
hold
that
the
district
of
columbia
is
a
territory
within
the
meaning
of
the
1871
civil
rights
act.
mr.
richard
w.
barton
i
do
not
remember
the
source
of
those
opinions.
they
are
cited
in
the
brief
of
respondent
i
believe.
mr.
richard
w.
barton
yes
it
is,
of
course.
under
the
plenary
jurisdiction
of
the
congress
and
any
remedy
that
a
person
would
have
and
any
court
to
which
a
person
would
go
would
be
a
federal
court
in
the
district
of
columbia,
certainly
in
1871.
so
that
is
one
of
the
reasons
why
we
contend
that
notwithstanding
the
fact
that
the
congress
knew
that
it
could
have
had
it
thought
about
it
make
the
act
expressly
applicable
to
the
district
of
columbia
or
applicable
by
implication.
it
would
not
have
done
so
had
it
thought
about
it
because
there
would
have
been
no
need
to
do
so
insofar
as
the
district
of
columbia.
mr.
richard
w.
barton
it
is,
however
--
mr.
richard
w.
barton
no,
not
without
the
constitutional
amendment.
it
is
--
mr.
richard
w.
barton
yes.
but
i
think
it
was
proposed
--
again
just
yesterday
in
the
paper
that
district
of
columbia
or
most
of
it
be
given
back
to
the
state
of
maryland,
but
it
is
the
present
governmental
entity.
the
district
of
columbia
is
a
municipal
corporation
created
about
a
hundred
years
ago
by
the
congress
and
which
does
have
the
power
to
sue
and
be
sued.
mr.
richard
w.
barton
yes.
mr.
richard
w.
barton
well,
i
say
we
have
not
explored
the
question.
i
would
be
like
--
mr.
richard
w.
barton
no,
we
did
not
bring
here
the
question
as
to
whether
or
not
1983
was
applicable
to
police
officers
as
distinguished
from
the
district
of
columbia
and
that
is
perhaps
why
i
am
not
prepared
to
answer
on
that,
but
if
the
court
would
like
a
supplemental
memo
on
that
issue
we
would
be
glad
to
supply
it.
mr.
richard
w.
barton
yes.
but
--
mr.
richard
w.
barton
yes
they
are,
all
applicable
law
here.
there
is
no
such
things
as
criminal
offense
against
the
district
of
columbia,
it
is
against
the
united
states,
and
of
course
the
laws
of
the
district
of
columbia,
those
enacted
by
the
federal
congress.
mr.
richard
w.
barton
oh
yes.
many
of
the
--
by
the
laws
are
enacted
by
the
congress,
it
enacts
certain
legislation
applicable
exclusively
to
the
district
of
columbia.
those
laws
are
codified
as
district
of
columbia,
in
the
district
of
columbia
code.
of
course,
there
are
many
other
laws
that
are
applicable
to
the
district
of
columbia
as
well
as
throughout
the
country.
mr.
richard
w.
barton
yes.
mr.
richard
w.
barton
yes.
the
plenary
power
which
the
congress
enjoys
over
the
district
of
columbia
is
extremely
broad
just
about
absolute.
it
can
do
just
about
anything
it
wants
to
consistent
with
the
constitution
for
the
district
of
columbia.
it
is
of
course
limited
as
to
what
it
can
be
elsewhere
with
the
interior
operation
of
municipalities
or
states.
the
other
side
contends
here
that
monroe
versus
pape
should
be
well
in
effect
overruled
by
this
court.
and
its
argument
in
support
of
that
is
that
a
number
of
other
lower
federal
courts
have
notwithstanding
monroe
versus
pape
applied
it
in
cases
seeking
injunctive
relief
and
that
is
true
there
are
four
circuits
which
i
have
held
that
notwithstanding
monroe
versus
pape,
you
can
seek
injunctive
relief
against
a
state
municipality.
there
are
a
number
of
other
cases
that
hold
to
the
contrary.
those
states
that
have
done
so
have
relied
upon
footnote
50
in
this
court’s
opinion
in
monroe
versus
pape.
several
commentators
have
suggested
that
they
have
completely
rewritten
or
misunderstood
that
footnote
50.
that
it
does
not
hold
as
several
of
the
circuit
courts
concluded
hold
that
they
were
limiting,
the
court
was
limiting
its
holding
in
monroe
versus
pape
only
the
actions
for
damages.
and
that
you
could
still
bring
an
action
for
injunctive
relief
under
1983
notwithstanding
monroe
versus
pape.
that
would
appear
to
be
completely
inconsistent
with
the
reasoning
on
monroe
versus
pape
because
if
a
municipality
is
not
a
person
within
the
meaning
of
the
act
as
this
court
held,
then
it
would
not
be
a
person
either
for
injunctive
relief
or
court
damages.
but
as
a
recent
district
court
in
delaware
pointed
out
perhaps
all
this
is
de
minimis
because
in
none
of
the
cases
in
which
the
courts
have
granted
injunctive
relief
under
1983
has
the
municipality
been
the
only
entity.
in
every
other
case,
in
every
case
there
has
been
governmental
officials,
members
of
the
school
board,
the
city
council,
the
mayor,
the
police
department
or
what
not
are
members.
if
they
are
amenable
to
injunctive
action
under
the
act,
it
does
not
really
add
very
much
to
say
--
to
add
the
municipality
too.
because
the
municipality
of
course
can
act
only
through
its
agents.
if
you
enjoin
its
agents
the
members
of
the
school
board,
the
city
council,
the
chief
of
police,
you
are
not
really
adding
anything
else
if
you
enjoin
the
municipality
on
top
of
that.
so
those
cases
while
we
submit
are
not
soundly
decided,
they
do
not
militate
against
the
soundness
of
monroe
versus
pape
as
we
see
it.
thank
you
your
honors.
mr.
richard
w.
barton
excuse,
excuse
me,
i
believe
it
does,
but
i
think
that
the
--
i
think
your
honor
it
is
correct,
it
is
1982.
mr.
richard
w.
barton
well
i
don’t
know
why
1982
--
mr.
richard
w.
barton
i
guess
that
is
correct
your
honor,
but
i
would
suppose
if
the
district
were
includable
in
1982,
it
also
going
to
be
included
within
1988.
mr.
richard
w.
barton
well,
i
think
that
they’re
both
the
same.
mr.
richard
w.
barton
well,
i
think
your
honor
that
the
objectives
of
the
all
the
sections
of
the
civil
rights
act
are
sufficiently
common
so
as
to
apply
to
the
district
of
columbia
as
other
state
or
territorial
subdivisions.
certainly,
it
would
be
an
anomalous
result
if
a
citizen
who
is
assaulted
by
a
policeman
across
the
district
line
in
montgomery
county
had
a
constitutional
cause
of
action
and
his
brother
lives
just
across
the
line
here
in
the
district
of
columbia,
did
not
for
a
similar
--
mr.
richard
w.
barton
well,
we
--
mr.
richard
w.
barton
no.
mr.
richard
w.
barton
yes
your
honor,
yes
your
honor.
of
course
1983
itself
was
aimed
that
vindicating
the
fourteenth
amendment
rights.
it
was
passed
pursuant
to
section
5
of
fourteenth
amendment.
mr.
richard
w.
barton
while
congress
is
the
sole
legislative
body,
the
police
here
are
essentially
locally
controlled
just
as
they
are
in
the
montgomery
country
or
fairfax
county?
mr.
richard
w.
barton
well,
i
suppose
your
honor
that
what
i
am
saying,
to
put
it
in
another
way
is
that
it
would
be
small
consolation
through
the
citizen
of
the
district
who
finds
himself
the
victim
of
police
brutality
to
know
that
he
does
not
have
a
cause
of
action
against
his
assailant
unlike
his
neighbor
who
lives
across
the
district
line
simply
because
the
district
is
a
federal
entity.
mr.
richard
w.
barton
well
--
mr.
richard
w.
barton
well,
that's
not
involved
in
this
case
of
course.
mr.
richard
w.
barton
well
--
mr.
richard
w.
barton
well
your
honor,
i
would
respond
to
that
only
by
saying
that
in
the
message
to
congress
from
president
grant
on
march
23
in
which
he
requested
them
to
act
this
sort
of
legislation,
he
said
“i
urgently
recommend
such
legislation
as
in
the
judgment
of
congress
shall
effectually
secure
life,
liberty
and
property
and
the
enforcement
of
law
in
all
parts
of
the
united
states.
he
was
not
restricting
the
impact
of
this
legislation.
mr.
richard
w.
barton
well,
as
your
honor,
as
it
was
pointed
out
there
has
never
been
any
question
raised
in
this
case
as
to
whether
it
was
applicable
to
district
--
mr.
richard
w.
barton
the
respondent
asked
this
court
to
reexamine
monroe
as
mr.
justice
douglas,
the
author
of
monroe
just
stated,
it
was
not
decided
on
constitutional
grounds,
but
upon
the
intent
of
congress
and
this
court
has
said
over
and
over
again
that
absent
clearly
showing
if
error
it
will
not
reexamine
non-constitutional
questions.
in
response
to
mr.
justice
stewart’s
question
a
little
while
ago,
to
me
hurd
versus
hodge
and
sewell
versus
pegelow
were
the
two
cases
i
had
in
mind.
hurd
as
mr.
justice
brennan
said
did
not
involve
the
1983,
but
it
was
cited
by
judge
sobeloff
in
sewell
versus
pegelow
for
that
proposition
and
judge
bazelon
in
this
case
has
picked
that
up
too.
thank
you,
your
honors.
mr.
richard
w.
barton
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
question
which
is
before
the
court
in
this
case
is
whether
or
not
the
district
of
columbia,
a
congressionally
created
municipal
corporation
is
a
person
within
the
meaning
of
the
1871
civil
rights
act,
42
u.s.c.
1983.
the
court
below
answered
the
question
in
the
affirmative.
it
is
our
contention
that
it
should
be
answered
in
the
negative.
in
this
respect,
we
rely
upon
the
decision
of
this
court
in
monroe
versus
pape
in
a
host
of
circuit
court
decisions
elsewhere
throughout
the
country
and
upon
the
legislative
history
of
the
1871
civil
rights
act.
we
start
with
the
proposition
that
is
undisputed
and
that
is,
that
if
the
district
of
columbia
and
other
municipal
corporations
are
persons
within
the
meaning
of
the
1871
act,
it
is
because
and
only
because
the
congress
so
intended.
now,
this
court
in
1961
in
monroe
versus
pape
in
a
unanimous
opinion
on
this
point,
an
opinion
authored
by
mr.
justice
douglas,
expressly
held
as
we
read
the
opinion
that
congress
did
not
intend
municipalities
to
be
included
within
the
word
person
as
used
in
the
1871
act.
the
court
below
held
that
notwithstanding
monroe
versus
pape,
the
district
of
columbia
was
a
person
within
the
meaning
of
that
act
and
it
did
so
on
two
independent
grounds.
first,
that
monroe
versus
pape
did
not
hold
that
municipalities
were
not
persons
within
the
meaning
of
the
act
but
rather
held
that
they
were
persons
within
the
meaning
of
the
act,
but
that
municipalities
could
not
be
held
liable
in
damages
under
the
civil
rights
act
to
the
extent
that
they
were
immune
under
local
law.
now,
the
court
did
not
phrase
it
in
quite
that
way,
but
that
is
the
necessary
effect
of
the
court’s
holding
because
it
held
that
the
civil
rights
act,
the
word
person
as
used
in
that
the
act
did
encompass
the
district
of
columbia
which
is
indisputable
a
municipal
corporation.
in
reaching
the
decision
that
it
did,
the
court
relied
upon
the
legislative
history
of
the
1871
civil
rights
act
which
was
thoroughly
explored
by
this
court
in
its
opinion
in
monroe.
it
pointed
out
that
one
of
the
reasons,
one
of
the
principal
reasons
which
led
to
the
so-called
sherman
amendment
or
amendments,
there
were
two
of
them,
the
second
one
is
slightly
watered-down
version,
indicated
that
many
of
the
members
of
the
congress
were
then
concerned
with
whether
or
not
the
congress
could
consistent
with
the
constitution
imposed
liability
upon
municipal
corporations.
that
issue
was
very
hotly
argued.
some
took
the
position
that
it
could,
others
took
the
position
that
it
could
not,
but
when
the
congress
rejected
that
amendment,
the
sherman
amendment,
now
the
sherman
amendment
would
have
made
municipalities
liable
for
actions
within
their
borders
by
persons
riotously
and
tumultuously
assembled
together
which
was
a
clear
reference
to
the
ku
klux
klan
and
similar
organizations.
that
amendment
was
rejected.
some
i
think
projected
it
because
they
were
convinced
that
it
was
unconstitutional.
others
perhaps
rejected
it
because
they
thought
it
was
unwise.
perhaps
still
others
because
they
thought
it
was
both
unwise
and
unconstitutional,
but
the
amendment
was
clearly
rejected.
and
as
this
court
unanimously
concluded
in
monroe
versus
pape,
that
legislative
history
is
so
forceful
as
a
reflection
of
the
intent
of
congress
that
it
would
just
be
impossible
to
conclude
that
the
congress
intended
to
include
municipalities
within
the
meaning
of
the
term
person
as
it
used
it
in
that
act.
now,
one
of
the
things
that
the
court
below
relied
upon
was
the
argument
which
had
been
advanced
to
this
court
in
monroe
versus
pape
but
which
is
not
referred
to
in
its
opinion
and
that
is
that,
in
light
of
the
concern
of
congress
as
to
whether
or
not
it
could
impose
liabilities
on
municipalities
when
they
were
immune
under
local
law,
the
court
should
limit
the
--
its
holding,
the
one
that
it
eventually
made
in
monroe
versus
pape
to
a
holding
that
municipalities
are
liable
under
the
civil
rights
act
only
to
the
extent
that
they
are
liable
under
local
law.
now,
the
second
basis
for
the
lower
court’s
decision
was
a
utilization
of
1988
of
title
42.
now,
that
is
the
statute
which
permits
federal
courts
when
they
are
administering
federal
laws
and
this
would
include
1983
to
borrow
provisions
of
state
laws
to
assist
the
federal
court
in
implementing
a
right
which
is
given
by
a
federal
statute
or
the
federal
constitution.
but
what
the
court
below
has
done
here
is
not
utilized
section
1988
to
implement
a
right,
but
rather
to
create
a
right
which
under
this
court’s
decision
in
monroe
versus
pape
does
not
exist.
this
court
said
in
monroe
versus
pape
that
there
is
no
right
to
bring
an
action
for
damages
against
a
municipality
under
1983.
so
the
court
made
an
end-run
so
to
speak
around
that
and
said,
“but
you
can
borrow
local
law
and
if
local
law
provides
for
liability
then
you
can
adopt
that
liability
and
use
that
to
implement
the
nonexistent
remedy
that
you
have
against
the
municipality
under
1983.”
we
submit
that
that
is
just
not
sound
reasoning.
it
has
been
rejected
by
several
circuit
court
decisions,
two
in
the
seventh
circuit,
one
in
the
ninth
circuit,
since
the
decision
in
this
case
came
down.
those
decisions
are
--
the
latest
of
those
decisions
is
moor
versus
madigan
the
ninth
circuit
decision
which
discusses
the
two
slightly
earlier
seventh
circuit
decisions
that
is
--
it
was
decided
on
april
the
12th
of
this
year
and
was
reported
in
458
federal
2nd
at
1217.
the
second
ground
which
the
court
below
gave
for
holding
that
the
--
mr.
richard
w.
barton
no,
your
honor,
it
is
not.
it
was
decided
--
it
is
458
f
2nd
at
page
1217.
mr.
richard
w.
barton
moor
versus
madigan.
mr.
richard
w.
barton
there
are
two
second
circuit
court
--
seventh
circuit
court
decisions
and
those
are
both
cited
and
referred
to
in
the
moor
versus
madigan
case.
those
were
decided
in
october
and
november
of
1971.
the
second
independent
ground
that
the
court
used
for
finding
the
district
of
columbia
amenable
to
suit
under
the
civil
rights
act
was
that
the
legislative
history
of
the
act
indicated
again
that
the
congress
was
primarily
concerned
with
the
constitutionality
of
imposing
liability
upon
municipalities
and
that
that
reluctance
to
do
so
which
the
congress
gave
into
could
not
have
applied
to
the
district
of
columbia.
that
congress
under
the
constitution
has
plenary
jurisdiction
over
the
district
of
columbia
and
it
could
not
have
been
concerned
with
whether
or
not
it
could,
had
it
chose
to
do
so
impose
liability
upon
the
municipal
corporation
of
the
district
of
columbia.
that
of
course
is
quite
true
as
far
as
it
goes,
clearly
the
congress
could
have
done
that.
there
is
nothing
in
the
legislative
history
that
we
have
been
able
to
find
that
even
mentions
the
district
of
columbia
or
indicates
that
congress
was
in
anyway
concerned
about
the
district
of
columbia
or
the
applicability
of
the
act
to
the
district.
mr.
richard
w.
barton
there
are
cases
that
touch
on
that
point.
i
cannot
say
that
it
is
settled,
but
our
position
would
be
that
if
congress
had
given
thought
to
this,
it
would
perhaps
have
excluded
the
district
of
columbia
expressly.
mr.
richard
w.
barton
there
are
cases
which
hold
and
we
do
not
challenge
this
point
that
insofar
as
the
act
applies
to
employees,
that
is
officers
of
the
municipal
corporation,
it
is
operable
within
the
district
of
columbia.
mr.
richard
w.
barton
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
w.
barton
no,
i
do
not
think
there
is
your
honor
but
we
have
not
challenged
that
aspect
of
the
holding
and
we
will
not
cross
that
here.
mr.
richard
w.
barton
no,
he
does
not.
his
holding
as
we
understand
it
is
that
because
the
congress
could
not
have
been
concerned
about
its
authority
to
impose
liability
on
the
district
of
columbia
since
it
had
plenary
power
of
the
district
of
columbia,
it
intended
the
act
to
apply
to
the
district
of
columbia,
but
the
main
purpose
of
the
act
was
to
give
a
federal
remedy
in
a
federal
court.
mr.
richard
w.
barton
yes.
mr.
richard
w.
barton
yes,
but
the
only
court
then
in
the
district
of
columbia
was
a
federal
court.
mr.
richard
w.
barton
so
there
was
no
need
to
give
a
federal
remedy
in
a
federal
court.
if
you
had
any
remedy
at
all,
if
the
act
applied
in
the
district
of
columbia,
you
would
automatically
have
a
remedy
in
a
federal
court.
mr.
richard
w.
barton
yes
and
that
issue
was
not
--
mr.
richard
w.
barton
no,
i
do
not
think
it
is.
the
other
side
i
think
does
cite
two
cases
in
which
they
say
hold
that
the
district
of
columbia
is
a
territory
within
the
meaning
of
the
1871
civil
rights
act.
mr.
richard
w.
barton
i
do
not
remember
the
source
of
those
opinions.
they
are
cited
in
the
brief
of
respondent
i
believe.
mr.
richard
w.
barton
yes
it
is,
of
course.
under
the
plenary
jurisdiction
of
the
congress
and
any
remedy
that
a
person
would
have
and
any
court
to
which
a
person
would
go
would
be
a
federal
court
in
the
district
of
columbia,
certainly
in
1871.
so
that
is
one
of
the
reasons
why
we
contend
that
notwithstanding
the
fact
that
the
congress
knew
that
it
could
have
had
it
thought
about
it
make
the
act
expressly
applicable
to
the
district
of
columbia
or
applicable
by
implication.
it
would
not
have
done
so
had
it
thought
about
it
because
there
would
have
been
no
need
to
do
so
insofar
as
the
district
of
columbia.
mr.
richard
w.
barton
it
is,
however
--
mr.
richard
w.
barton
no,
not
without
the
constitutional
amendment.
it
is
--
mr.
richard
w.
barton
yes.
but
i
think
it
was
proposed
--
again
just
yesterday
in
the
paper
that
district
of
columbia
or
most
of
it
be
given
back
to
the
state
of
maryland,
but
it
is
the
present
governmental
entity.
the
district
of
columbia
is
a
municipal
corporation
created
about
a
hundred
years
ago
by
the
congress
and
which
does
have
the
power
to
sue
and
be
sued.
mr.
richard
w.
barton
yes.
mr.
richard
w.
barton
well,
i
say
we
have
not
explored
the
question.
i
would
be
like
--
mr.
richard
w.
barton
no,
we
did
not
bring
here
the
question
as
to
whether
or
not
1983
was
applicable
to
police
officers
as
distinguished
from
the
district
of
columbia
and
that
is
perhaps
why
i
am
not
prepared
to
answer
on
that,
but
if
the
court
would
like
a
supplemental
memo
on
that
issue
we
would
be
glad
to
supply
it.
mr.
richard
w.
barton
yes.
but
--
mr.
richard
w.
barton
yes
they
are,
all
applicable
law
here.
there
is
no
such
things
as
criminal
offense
against
the
district
of
columbia,
it
is
against
the
united
states,
and
of
course
the
laws
of
the
district
of
columbia,
those
enacted
by
the
federal
congress.
mr.
richard
w.
barton
oh
yes.
many
of
the
--
by
the
laws
are
enacted
by
the
congress,
it
enacts
certain
legislation
applicable
exclusively
to
the
district
of
columbia.
those
laws
are
codified
as
district
of
columbia,
in
the
district
of
columbia
code.
of
course,
there
are
many
other
laws
that
are
applicable
to
the
district
of
columbia
as
well
as
throughout
the
country.
mr.
richard
w.
barton
yes.
mr.
richard
w.
barton
yes.
the
plenary
power
which
the
congress
enjoys
over
the
district
of
columbia
is
extremely
broad
just
about
absolute.
it
can
do
just
about
anything
it
wants
to
consistent
with
the
constitution
for
the
district
of
columbia.
it
is
of
course
limited
as
to
what
it
can
be
elsewhere
with
the
interior
operation
of
municipalities
or
states.
the
other
side
contends
here
that
monroe
versus
pape
should
be
well
in
effect
overruled
by
this
court.
and
its
argument
in
support
of
that
is
that
a
number
of
other
lower
federal
courts
have
notwithstanding
monroe
versus
pape
applied
it
in
cases
seeking
injunctive
relief
and
that
is
true
there
are
four
circuits
which
i
have
held
that
notwithstanding
monroe
versus
pape,
you
can
seek
injunctive
relief
against
a
state
municipality.
there
are
a
number
of
other
cases
that
hold
to
the
contrary.
those
states
that
have
done
so
have
relied
upon
footnote
50
in
this
court’s
opinion
in
monroe
versus
pape.
several
commentators
have
suggested
that
they
have
completely
rewritten
or
misunderstood
that
footnote
50.
that
it
does
not
hold
as
several
of
the
circuit
courts
concluded
hold
that
they
were
limiting,
the
court
was
limiting
its
holding
in
monroe
versus
pape
only
the
actions
for
damages.
and
that
you
could
still
bring
an
action
for
injunctive
relief
under
1983
notwithstanding
monroe
versus
pape.
that
would
appear
to
be
completely
inconsistent
with
the
reasoning
on
monroe
versus
pape
because
if
a
municipality
is
not
a
person
within
the
meaning
of
the
act
as
this
court
held,
then
it
would
not
be
a
person
either
for
injunctive
relief
or
court
damages.
but
as
a
recent
district
court
in
delaware
pointed
out
perhaps
all
this
is
de
minimis
because
in
none
of
the
cases
in
which
the
courts
have
granted
injunctive
relief
under
1983
has
the
municipality
been
the
only
entity.
in
every
other
case,
in
every
case
there
has
been
governmental
officials,
members
of
the
school
board,
the
city
council,
the
mayor,
the
police
department
or
what
not
are
members.
if
they
are
amenable
to
injunctive
action
under
the
act,
it
does
not
really
add
very
much
to
say
--
to
add
the
municipality
too.
because
the
municipality
of
course
can
act
only
through
its
agents.
if
you
enjoin
its
agents
the
members
of
the
school
board,
the
city
council,
the
chief
of
police,
you
are
not
really
adding
anything
else
if
you
enjoin
the
municipality
on
top
of
that.
so
those
cases
while
we
submit
are
not
soundly
decided,
they
do
not
militate
against
the
soundness
of
monroe
versus
pape
as
we
see
it.
thank
you
your
honors.
mr.
richard
w.
barton
excuse,
excuse
me,
i
believe
it
does,
but
i
think
that
the
--
i
think
your
honor
it
is
correct,
it
is
1982.
mr.
richard
w.
barton
well
i
don’t
know
why
1982
--
mr.
richard
w.
barton
i
guess
that
is
correct
your
honor,
but
i
would
suppose
if
the
district
were
includable
in
1982,
it
also
going
to
be
included
within
1988.
mr.
richard
w.
barton
well,
i
think
that
they’re
both
the
same.
mr.
richard
w.
barton
well,
i
think
your
honor
that
the
objectives
of
the
all
the
sections
of
the
civil
rights
act
are
sufficiently
common
so
as
to
apply
to
the
district
of
columbia
as
other
state
or
territorial
subdivisions.
certainly,
it
would
be
an
anomalous
result
if
a
citizen
who
is
assaulted
by
a
policeman
across
the
district
line
in
montgomery
county
had
a
constitutional
cause
of
action
and
his
brother
lives
just
across
the
line
here
in
the
district
of
columbia,
did
not
for
a
similar
--
mr.
richard
w.
barton
well,
we
--
mr.
richard
w.
barton
no.
mr.
richard
w.
barton
yes
your
honor,
yes
your
honor.
of
course
1983
itself
was
aimed
that
vindicating
the
fourteenth
amendment
rights.
it
was
passed
pursuant
to
section
5
of
fourteenth
amendment.
mr.
richard
w.
barton
while
congress
is
the
sole
legislative
body,
the
police
here
are
essentially
locally
controlled
just
as
they
are
in
the
montgomery
country
or
fairfax
county?
mr.
richard
w.
barton
well,
i
suppose
your
honor
that
what
i
am
saying,
to
put
it
in
another
way
is
that
it
would
be
small
consolation
through
the
citizen
of
the
district
who
finds
himself
the
victim
of
police
brutality
to
know
that
he
does
not
have
a
cause
of
action
against
his
assailant
unlike
his
neighbor
who
lives
across
the
district
line
simply
because
the
district
is
a
federal
entity.
mr.
richard
w.
barton
well
--
mr.
richard
w.
barton
well,
that's
not
involved
in
this
case
of
course.
mr.
richard
w.
barton
well
--
mr.
richard
w.
barton
well
your
honor,
i
would
respond
to
that
only
by
saying
that
in
the
message
to
congress
from
president
grant
on
march
23
in
which
he
requested
them
to
act
this
sort
of
legislation,
he
said
“i
urgently
recommend
such
legislation
as
in
the
judgment
of
congress
shall
effectually
secure
life,
liberty
and
property
and
the
enforcement
of
law
in
all
parts
of
the
united
states.
he
was
not
restricting
the
impact
of
this
legislation.
mr.
richard
w.
barton
well,
as
your
honor,
as
it
was
pointed
out
there
has
never
been
any
question
raised
in
this
case
as
to
whether
it
was
applicable
to
district
--
mr.
richard
w.
barton
the
respondent
asked
this
court
to
reexamine
monroe
as
mr.
justice
douglas,
the
author
of
monroe
just
stated,
it
was
not
decided
on
constitutional
grounds,
but
upon
the
intent
of
congress
and
this
court
has
said
over
and
over
again
that
absent
clearly
showing
if
error
it
will
not
reexamine
non-constitutional
questions.
in
response
to
mr.
justice
stewart’s
question
a
little
while
ago,
to
me
hurd
versus
hodge
and
sewell
versus
pegelow
were
the
two
cases
i
had
in
mind.
hurd
as
mr.
justice
brennan
said
did
not
involve
the
1983,
but
it
was
cited
by
judge
sobeloff
in
sewell
versus
pegelow
for
that
proposition
and
judge
bazelon
in
this
case
has
picked
that
up
too.
thank
you,
your
honors.
