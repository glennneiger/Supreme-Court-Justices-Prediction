justice
potter
stewart
well,
what
you
have
just
said
leads
me
to
inquire
whether
or
not
it
is
settled
that
section
1983
applies
to
the
district
of
columbia
at
all
quite
apart
from
this
now
a
question
about
liability
of
a
municipality
certainly
by
its
legislative
history
with
which
i
am
reasonably
familiar
having
written
a
couple
of
opinions
in
the
area,
indicates
concern
by
congress
of
what
was
being
done
in
the
individual
states,
particularly
the
states
which
had
recently
been
--
involved
in
the
war
between
the
states.
the
statute
talks
about
under
the
color
of
any
statute
of
any
state
or
territory
i
would
suppose
a
legislative
history
would
indicate
certainly
that
congress
wasn't
concerned
with
the
district
of
columbia
over
which
it
had
exclusive
legislative
and
other
control.
is
it
settled?
has
it
been
settled
that
the
district
of
columbia
for
purposes
of
section
1983
is
a
state
or
a
territory?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
is
it
included
in
that
statutory
language,
do
you
understand
it
to
be?
justice
potter
stewart
there
is
no
case
in
this
court
is
still
holding,
is
it?
justice
potter
stewart
as
i
read
the
holding
and
i
have
reread
it
just
now,
judge
bazelon's
opinion,
that
isn't
an
aspect
of
his
holding.
he
does
not
even
discuss
it,
does
he?
justice
potter
stewart
as
against
state
action?
justice
potter
stewart
and
here
we
are
talking
about
a
federal
government,
one
under
the
complete
control
of
congress,
the
government
of
the
district
of
columbia?
justice
potter
stewart
exactly.
justice
potter
stewart
in
other
words
before
one
even
got
to
the
question
of
the
limits
of
if
any
of
monroe
against
pape,
i
should
think
the
preliminary
question
would
be
whether
section
1983
is
applicable
to
the
district
of
columbia
or
its
employees,
officers
or
agents
at
all?
justice
potter
stewart
not
discussed
by
the
court
of
appeals,
it's
not
discussed
in
either
brief,
as
i
understand
it?
justice
potter
stewart
there
are
two
decisions
what
of
the
court
of
appeals
of
the
district
of
columbia?
justice
potter
stewart

justice
potter
stewart
and
what
was
the
other
citation?
justice
potter
stewart
291
f.
2nd,
196.
justice
potter
stewart
i
think
your
brother
said
that
there
were
couple
of
citations
in
your
brief
but
i
didn’t
--
justice
potter
stewart
surely
it
doesn't.
why
would
that
follow?
justice
potter
stewart
1982,
we
held
in
jones
against
mayer
was
an
act
of
congress
authorized
by
the
thirteenth
amendment
which
abolished
slavery
throughout
the
entire
united
states
and
every
state
and
every
territory
and
in
the
district
of
columbia.
1983
by
contrast
has
quite
a
different
legislative
history
and
shows
a
concern
with
the
action
of
state
officers
in
those
states
which,
to
use
congress'
rather
tactless
words
in
those
days,
have
lately
been
in
rebellion
against
the
union.
and
why
would
in
the
light
of
that
legislative
history
would
1983
apply
to
the
district
of
columbia
which
is
entirely
under
the
aegis,
supervision
and
power
of
the
congress
of
the
united
states?
justice
potter
stewart
he
might
have
all
sorts
of
rights
in
the
district
of
columbia
under
that
law
of
the
district
of
columbia,
under
the
federal
common
law,
statutory
law
against
the
policeman
or
the
policeman's
superior,
but
the
question
is
here
is
the
applicability
of
a
statute
that
was
denied
to
curb
actions
under
color
of
state
law
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
and
to
give
and
to
confer
federal
jurisdiction
upon
such
actions.
now
here
in
the
district
of
columbia
all
the
courts
are
federal
courts?
justice
potter
stewart
the
question
is
the
legislation
with
which
congress
responded
to
that
message,
that
is
where
--
that
is
what
we
have
to
try
to
follow?
justice
potter
stewart
right,
pointing
out
that
judge
bazelon
has
assumed
it
and
cited
hurd
against
hodge
which
on
examination
doesn't
stand
