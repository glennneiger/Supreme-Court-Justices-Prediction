we'll
hear
argument
next
in
71-564,
district
of
columbia
against
carter.
mr.
barton
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
the
district
of
columbia
is
surely
something
more
of
a
federal
instrumentality
than
a
new
territory,
isn't
that?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it
has
already
been
pointed
out
that
the
compelling
reasons
for
the
1983
as
with
the
fourteenth
amendment
itself
was
to
protect
individuals
against
state
action,
not
against
federal
action
in
this
context,
isn't
that
true?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
the
district
of
columbia,
acts
of
the
district
of
columbia
are
federal
acts,
are
they
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
that
partly
derives
from
the
fact
that
the
congress
would
have
no
power
to
enact
a
great
many
of
the
laws
in
the
district
of
columbia
code
and
make
them
applicable
to
the
states,
is
that
not
so?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
because
it
has
a
speed
limit
for
iowa
or
california
or
many
of
the
other
criminal
acts?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
mr.
barton.
mr.
kaplan.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
the
hurd
case
cited
in
your
brief?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
give
us
that
citation
again?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what’s
the
title
again?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
aren't
they
concerned
to
not
report
that
with
improving
the
practice
procedure,
they
are
not
concerned
with
rights
of
third
persons,
are
they?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
they
are
not
talking
about
rights
in
the
sense,
we
are
talking
about
here
the
right
to
recover.
they
are
talking
about
improve
police
practices
so
that
people's
rights
will
be
respected
in
the
broad
sense,
aren't
they?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
kaplan.
mr.
barton
do
you
have
it
any
further?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
gentleman,
i
think
it
might
be
useful
in
this
case
in
view
of
some
of
the
developments
that
occurred
during
oral
argument
for
you
to
submit
supplemental
memos
if
you
would
like,
covering
these
factors
that
you
have
referred
to
in
the
hurd
and
the
sewell
case.
it
might
help
us
unravel
the
situation.
the
case
is
submitted.
