you
do
have
a
dc
code
though
that
is
different
from
the
united
states
code?
justice
william

rehnquist
i
don’t
quite
see
the
anomaly
that
you
describe
mr.
kaplan
saying
that
it
would
be
a
anomaly
if
in
a
state
a
man
had
an
action,
a
cause
of
action
based
on
an
act
of
congress
that
was
designed
to
prevent
states
from
depriving
people
of
constitution
rights,
but
he
didn't
have
the
same
cause
of
action
here
in
the
district
where
congress
is
the
sole
legislative
body?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist

with
the
anomaly
under
a
statute
like
1982?
