mr.
richard
b.
stone
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
a
corporate
income
tax
case
here
on
the
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
claims.
the
sole
issue
presented
in
the
government’s
petition
for
certiorari
is
whether
the
respondent
railroad
is
entitled
to
take
depreciation
deductions
with
respect
to
certain
to
properties
paid
for
by
governmental
agencies
for
the
purpose
of
improving
safety
and
traffic
flow
at
highway
--
railroad
intersections.
the
issue
is
governed
as
i
shall
explain
by
provisions
of
the
internal
revenue
code
of
1939
which
are
no
longer
applicable
under
the
internal
revenue
code
of
1954.
the
resolution
of
this
question
of
construction
of
the
1939
code,
however,
will
continue
to
effect
tax
returns
filed
for
many
future
years,
especially
with
respect
to
the
railroading
utility
industries
because
the
relevant
amendments
to
the
1954
code
do
not
apply
to
properties
paid
for
as
for
those
in
issue
here
prior
to
1954
and
most
of
these
properties
have
very
long
useful
lives,
in
some
cases,
as
many
as
50
or
60
years.
the
background
of
the
properties
with
respect
to
which
respondent
seeks
depreciation
deductions
here
is
as
follows.
beginning
in
the
early
1930s,
respondent
and
many
other
railroads
entered
into
agreements
with
various
state
governments
for
construction
of
facilities
to
improve
the
safety
and
traffic
flow
conditions
at
highway-railroad
intersections.
the
initial
agreements
between
the
railroads
and
the
states
provided
that
the
states
would
substantially,
though
not
entirely,
reimburse
the
railroads
for
those
facilities
which
it
was
the
railroad’s
obligation
to
construct.
shortly
after
these
initial
agreements
were
reached,
congress
passed
a
series
of
statutes
which
authorized
the
federal
government
to
pay
at
least
part
of
the
state
share
of
the
construction
cost
of
these
facilities.
this
is
set
forth
in
the
national
industry
recovery
act
at
48
stat.
195,
section
203
and
is
a
1933
statute.
in
the
years
following
the
initial
agreements
and
the
initial
authorization
of
partial
federal
reimbursement
of
state
expenses,
the
railroads
who
presumably
felt
that
these
facilities
designed
to
improve
highway
traffic
conditions
were
tangential
to
the
profitable
operation
of
their
railroad
business
displayed
great
reluctance
to
share
substantially
in
the
construction
costs
and
disputes
between
the
railroads
and
the
states
were
quite
frequent
over
allocation
of
the
costs.
in
order
to
settle
these
disputes,
the
congress
passed
the
federal
highway
act
of
1944
which
was
basically
a
stepped
version
of
the
prior
act
and
this
act
authorized
the
federal
government
to
reimburse
the
states
for
the
entire
cost
of
the
facilities
such
as
those
at
issue
here,
subject
only
to
the
limitation
that
to
the
extent
that
the
railroad
was
deemed
to
receive
direct
benefit
from
these
facilities,
it
should
reimburse
the
federal
government
on
a
pro
rata
basis
up
to
a
maximum
of
10%
of
the
cost
of
any
particular
facility.
the
result
was
that
the
states
initially
absorbed
all
or
most
of
the
cost
of
the
facilities
for
which
they
were
reimbursed
by
the
federal
government
and
the
railroads
paid
only
so
much
as
was
deemed
to
reflect
the
benefit
which
the
railroad
derived
from
the
facilities
and
this
court
in
no
event
exceed
10%
of
the
cost.
now,
although
there
is
some
question
as
to
whether
respondents
or
the
states
have
title
to
the
facilities
under
the
terms
of
these
agreements.
the
agreements
do
provide
that
respondent
is
obligated
to
maintain
the
facilities
“directly
related
to
railroad
use,”
such
as
rail
bridges
and
roadbeds
and
tracks
and
the
states
are
correspondingly
required
maintain
the
facilities
directly
related
to
motor
vehicle
use
such
as
highway
bridges
and
approaches.
the
majority
of
the
court
of
claims
here
appears
to
have
assumed
that
the
obligation
to
maintain
these
facilities
includes
the
obligation
to
replace
worn
out
equipment.
judge
davis
found
that
questionable
proposition,
but
he
court
of
claims
appears
to
have
found
the
respondent
had
the
obligation
here
to
maintain
and
replace
those,
at
least
those
facilities,
most
directly
related
to
railroad
use.
and
at
this
point,
i
should
point
out
that
the
government
and
respondent
appear
to
be
in
some
disagreement
as
to
precisely
the
type
of
facilities
which
respondent
seeks
here
to
depreciate.
the
court
of
claims
did
not
make
a
specific
finding
as
to
what
percentage
of
the
facilities
at
issue
here
were
of
the
type
closely
related
to
the
railroad
business
and
correspondingly
what
percentage
were
closely
related
to
highway
use
and
this
would
bear
for
example,
upon
the
question
whether
respondent
was
obligated
to
maintain
and
replace
the
facilities
that
it
seeks
to
depreciate,
a
question
which
to
be
sure,
we
do
not
believe
to
be
dispositive
of
this
case.
the
court
did
find
and
this
finding
is
at
page
55a
of
our
certiorari
petition
that
about
a
million
and
a
half
or
a
somewhat
more
than
$2
million
of
property
at
issue
here,
was
in
the
category
of
“highway
under
crossings
or
highway
over
crossings.”
we
assumed
perhaps
in
some
haste,
that
highway
under
crossings
and
highway
over
crossings
referred
to
highway
facilities
over
railroad
tracks
and
concluded
on
that
basis
that
at
least
71%
of
the
amount
in
controversy
represented
facilities
in
the
category
most
directly
related
to
highway
use.
judge
davis
appears
to
have
assumed
the
same
thing
and
i
refer
you
in
that
connection
to
footnote
2
on
page
48a
of
the
petition.
respondent
now
asserts
in
his
brief
that
it
is
not
claiming
any
highway
structures
here
and
that
the
items
in
its
account
6
which
the
court
of
claims
described
as
highway
under
crossings
are
in
fact
railroad
bridges
of
some
sort.
in
this
connection,
it
cites
the
joint
exhibit
found
at
page
51
of
the
appendix
in
which
the
items
in
account
6
are
described
simply
as
bridges.
respondent
claims
that
the
bridges
in
this
account
are
all
rail
bridges
and
that
in
spite
of
the
finding
of
the
court
of
claims,
it
has
not
sought
to
depreciate
any
highway
under
crossings
or
over
crossings.
now,
our
examination
of
the
record
in
this
case
including
an
inspection
of
the
tax
returns
filed
by
respondent
does
not
provide
a
satisfactory
answer
to
the
question
whether
the
items
in
account
6
include
highway
crossings
and
if
so,
to
what
extent
and
the
litigation
as
i
think
quite
rightfully
not
focused
closely
on
this
point.
we
felt
it
is
desirable
to
bring
this
discrepancy
between
our
reading
of
the
record
and
respondent’s
assertion
to
the
court’s
attention,
but
for
reasons
which
i
shall
refer
to
several
times
in
the
course
of
this
argument,
hopefully,
our
position
is
in
no
way
dependent
upon
the
answer
to
the
question
whether
the
bulk
of
the
facilities
in
question
were
directly
related
to
highway
use
or
railway
use.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
i
think
it
is
right,
they
could
mr.
justice
rehnquist
and
in
that
connection,
it
may
have
been
hasty
of
us
to
assume
that
it
referred
to
highway
structures.
i
believe
judge
davis
assumed
the
same
thing
because
in
this
footnote
2
on
page
48a
of
the
petition,
he
refers
to
the
fact
that
three
quarters
of
the
structures
in
question
were
those
were
highway
over
crossings
or
under
crossings
and
that
part
of
the
agreements
between
the
states
and
the
railroads
included
the
condition
that
the
railroads
would
not
--
that
the
states
would
not
have
to
pay
for
an
easement
with
respect
to
those
structures.
and
i
assume
that
if
there
is
any
question
involving
the
state
applying
for
requiring
an
easement
in
order
to
make
the
construction
it
would
probably
refer
to
a
highway
construction
in
which
it
was
the
state's
obligation
to
constructing
not
a
rail
construction,
that
isn’t
crystal
clear
either.
in
any
event,
we
do
not
believe
that
this
is
at
all
dispositive
of
the
issues
in
the
case
and
i
shall
have
occasion
to
explain
why
in
the
course
of
the
argument.
i
want
to
bring
out
one
more
background
to
this
case.
in
the
series
of
events
described
at
length
in
our
brief
and
in
the
opinion
of
the
court
of
claims,
respondent
as
a
condition
to
obtaining
the
permission
of
the
internal
revenue
service
to
change
its
basic
depreciation
accounting
technique,
respondent
entered
into
a
terms
letter
agreement
with
the
internal
revenue
service
in
which
the
respondent
promised
among
other
things
that
it
would
not
take
depreciation
deductions
with
respect
to
properties
that
had
been
donated
to
it.
and
so
for
years,
respondent
declined
to
claim
depreciation
deductions
with
respect
to
the
assets
at
issue
here.
suddenly
in
1965,
respondent
brought
a
law
suit
in
the
court
of
claims
alleging
that
it
overpaid
its
income
tax
for
the
year
1955
and
that
is
the
year
at
issue
here
when
it
failed
to
take
depreciation
deductions
on
these
properties
paid
for
by
the
government.
and
the
court
of
claims
held
by
a
margin
of
four
to
three,
judge
davis
dissenting
vigorously
that
respondent
was
indeed
entitled
to
include
the
value
of
these
properties
in
its
depreciation
base
and
to
take
deductions
though
it
had
incurred
no
costs
in
the
acquisition
of
these
assets.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
yes,
there
are
mr.
justice
blackmun?
mr.
richard
b.
stone
i’m
not
sure
whether
all
of
them
do
mr.
justice
blackmun,
but
if
--
i
am
told
that
the
terms
letter
agreements
were
very
widespread
in
the
railroad
industry.
they
are
basically
involved,
the
post
second
world
war
changes
from
retirement
to
depreciation
accounting
and
i
am
told
that
that
was
such
a
widespread
practice
due
to
the
fact
there
was
such
low
retirements
and
high
profits
during
the
second
world
war
and
most
railroads
and
most
industries
generally,
did
their
accounting
on
the
basis
of
--
did
their
accounting
on
the
basis
of
retirement,
but
it
became
much
more
profitable
after
the
war
to
do
it
on
the
basis
of
straight
depreciation
technique.
but
i
don’t
know
specifically,
if
there
are
any
cases
backed
up
right
now
which
do
not
involve
the
terms
letter.
in
deciding
this
issue
in
respondent's
favor
the
court
of
claims
held
both
that
the
depreciation
deductions
were
allowable
on
the
applicable
provisions
of
the
1939
code
and
then
in
addition,
respondent
had
not
given
up
its
right
to
take
depreciation
deductions
on
donated
properties
when
it
entered
into
these
terms
letter
agreements.
it
is
our
position
that
even
if
the
1939
code
allowed
the
respondent
a
depreciation
deduction
in
these
circumstances
which
we
certainly
believe
it
did
not,
respondent
was
precluded
from
taking
these
deductions
as
a
result
of
the
binding
terms
letter
agreement
it
entered
into.
this
is
a
question
of
contract
interpretation
essentially.
it
is
quite
thoroughly
covered
in
our
brief
and
i
shall
focus
my
attention
in
this
argument
on
the
primary
question
with
respect
to
which
we
sought
certiorari
here
which
is
whether
the
respondent
is
entitled
under
the
terms
of
the
1939
code,
to
take
deductions
in
these
circumstances
for
the
depreciation
of
properties
in
which
it
has
incurred
no
cost.
the
fundamental
concept
of
the
depreciation
deduction
and
this
is
virtually
an
(inaudible)
since
its
inception
has
been
that
tax
payers
deduct
from
taxable
income
that
portion
of
their
assets
which
is
used
up
in
earning
that
income.
the
deduction
for
depreciation
is
essentially
an
expense
deduction.
it’s
designed
to
reflect
approximately
that
portion
of
a
taxpayer’s
expense
incurred
in
the
purchase
of
its
assets
which
is
attributable
to
the
production
of
income
in
any
particular
year.
accordingly,
both
the
1939
and
1954
internal
revenue
codes
provide
that
the
basis
on
which
depreciation
is
allowed
is
the
same
as
the
basis
for
determining
gain
or
loss
in
disposition
of
the
property
and
in
most
instances,
this
is
the
expense
that
the
taxpayer
has
incurred
in
purchasing
the
asset
which
is
of
course
the
taxpayer’s
cost.
if
an
asset
has
caused
the
taxpayer
nothing,
its
gradual
consumption
represents
no
expense
to
him
and
there
is
ordinarily
no
reason
to
give
him
an
expense
deduction.
now,
there
ought
to
be
sure
certain
refinements
of
the
general
rule
that
the
depreciation
basis
is
the
taxpayers
cost.
in
certain
situations
for
example,
the
tax
laws
have
historically
provided
that
a
taxpayer
to
whom
assets
are
transferred
in
certain
well
defined
types
of
transactions,
takes
over
the
basis
of
the
transferor
rather
than
acquiring
a
new
basis.
this
is
known
commonly
as
a
carryover
basis.
this
is
true
for
example
where
a
taxpayer
receives
property
in
a
transfer
which
the
code
characterizes
as
a
gift.
there
is
also
a
carryover
of
the
transferor's
basis
in
many
situations
in
which
property
is
transferred
to
a
corporation
by
its
shareholders
for
example.
section
358
of
the
internal
revenue
code
of
1954
provides
a
classic
example
of
carryover
basis
which
is
a
carryover
basis
for
property
transfer
to
a
corporation
in
a
section
351
transfer
which
is
transfer
in
exchange
for
stock
or
securities
in
a
corporation
controlled
by
the
transferors.
the
reasons
for
providing
a
carryover
basis
in
these
situations
are
various
and
they
are
quite
complex
and
would
not
fruitfully
be
explored
in
the
context
of
this
argument.
but
i
would
suggest
that
close
analysis
justifies
the
conclusion
that
these
provisions
do
not
really
represent
departures
from
the
notion
that
basis
is
fundamentally
a
function
of
cost.
rather
these
special
provisions
reflect
the
legislative
view
that
in
certain
circumstances,
well
defined
and
for
certain
reasons,
the
purposes
of
the
code
are
most
consistently
and
effectively
carried
out
when
the
basis
of
an
asset
is
unchanged
in
the
hands
of
a
transferee
or
if
you
will,
when
the
cost
basis
of
someone
else
other
than
the
transferee
taxpayer
is
the
most
appropriate
basis.
now,
what
is
the
situation
that
we
deal
with
here?
section
113
(a)
(8)
(b)
of
the
1939
code,
provided
that
corporate
taxpayers
could
take
over
that
transferor’s
basis,
a
carryover
basis,
in
this
case
to
be
sure
that
assets
we’re
dealing
with
are
new
and
so
that
the
question
is
not
one
of
whether
it
is
a
carryover
basis
or
a
taxpayer’s
cost
basis
because
those
are
one
of
the
same,
the
question
is
simply
whether
the
taxpayer
takes
over
any
basis
at
all
on
these
assets.
section
113
(a)
(8)
(b),
provided
that
corporate
taxpayers
could
take
the
transferor’s
basis
including
for
purposes
of
depreciation
in
property
transferred
as
“a
"contribution
to
capital"”
and
that
is
the
term
we
are
dealing
with
here.
ordinarily,
that
term
“"contribution
to
capital"”
refers
to
a
transfer
of
money
or
other
property
to
a
corporation
by
a
shareholder.
in
this
situation,
the
"contribution
to
capital"
is
quite
logically
considered
a
part
of
the
shareholder’s
investment
in
his
equity
interest
in
the
corporation
and
it’s
treated
much
the
same
way
as
consideration
paid
for
example
for
the
issuance
of
stock.
but
the
internal
revenue
code
of
1939
did
not
restrict
the
right
to
acquire
a
basis
and
correspondingly
to
depreciate
assets
donated
as
contributions
to
capital
--
to
assets
donated
by
shareholders.
it
simply
provided
that
the
corporation
acquired
the
transferor’s
basis
and
a
"contribution
to
capital."
consequently,
it
appears
that
the
1939
code
contemplated
that
non-shareholders
could
also
make
contributions
to
a
corporation’s
capital
and
that
the
corporation
could
take
over
the
transferor’s
basis
in
these
assets
for
depreciation
purposes.
significantly
by
virtue
of
this
court’s
holding
in
edwards
against
cuba
railroad
268
u.s.,
a
property
transferred
in
these
circumstances
was
held
not
to
constitute
income
to
the
transferee
corporation.
nonetheless,
under
the
1939
code,
corporate
taxpayers
who
received
the
donated
assets
which
could
be
categorized
as
contributions
to
capital,
were
able
to
take
depreciation
deductions
with
respect
to
these
assets
in
which
they
had
no
investment
and
which
they
had
received
entirely
for
income
tax
liability.
congress
changed
the
situation
when
it
enacted
the
internal
revenue
code
of
1954.
section
362
(c)
of
the
current
code
provides
that
contributions
to
capital
made
by
non-shareholders
after
june
1954
have
a
basis
of
zero
for
depreciation
and
other
purposes
in
the
hands
of
the
transferee,
so
that
the
basis
is
no
longer
carried
over
from
the
transferor.
but
for
cases
such
as
this
one
which
involved
assets
transferred
before
the
application
--
the
applicable
date
of
section
362,
it
is
still
necessary
to
inquire
whether
the
transfer
in
question
can
be
classified
as
a
"contribution
to
capital"
within
the
meeting
of
section
113
(a)
(8)
of
the
1939
code.
let
me
make
it
clear
that
we
are
not
in
any
way
whatsoever
implying
that
respondent
should
be
deprived
of
a
benefit
which
the
1939
code
provides
to
it.
we
are
not
attempting
to
make
the
amendments
contained
in
section
362
of
the
1954
code
retroactive
because
they
are
explicitly
made
prospective
in
application
only.
the
specific
issue
in
this
case,
however,
is
the
definition
of
the
term
"contribution
to
capital"
as
used
in
section
113
(a)
(8)
(b)
of
the
1939
code
and
that
term
is
not
defined
in
the
code.
as
i’ve
indicated,
it
is
a
term
ordinarily
associated
with
transfers
by
shareholders
or
persons
with
underlying
equity
interests
in
a
corporation.
the
question
in
this
case
is,
what
does
the
term
"contribution
to
capital"
mean
in
the
context
of
a
transfer
to
a
corporation
by
a
non-shareholder?
with
respect
to
this
question,
we
believe
that
it
is
highly
relevant
to
understand
that
the
allowance
of
a
depreciation
basis
in
this
circumstances
was
a
departure
from
the
traditional
notion
of
depreciation
as
a
reflection
of
expense
actually
incurred
as
an
asset
is
used
up
and
we
believe
it
is
reasonable
to
conclude
from
the
context
that
the
term
"contribution
to
capital"
was
not
intended
to
apply
to
all
transfers
made
to
a
corporation
without
immediately
apparent
consideration,
but
that
the
term
was
intended
to
have
a
rather
specific
meaning
and
it
is
that
meaning
which
we
are
attempting
to
uncover
here.
indeed,
we
submit
that
the
decisions
of
this
court
rendered
while
section
113
(a)
(8)
(b)
was
still
in
effect
have
interpreted
the
term
"contribution
to
capital"
in
the
context
of
non-shareholder
transfers
in
a
very
specific
and
limited
way.
essentially,
we
deal
with
two
cases
in
which
this
court
specifically
considered
whether
transfers
of
assets
to
a
corporation
by
a
non-shareholder
constituted
contributions
to
capital.
in
both
of
these
two
cases,
the
court
tested
the
assets
in
question
in
terms
of
the
donative
intent
of
the
transferor.
specifically
in
terms
of
whether
the
transferor’s
intention
was
to
increase
the
corporation’s
capital,
whether
he
was
making
a
contribution
to
the
corporation’s
capital.
thus,
in
the
detroit
edison
case,
decided
in
1943
at
319
u.s.,
the
taxpayer
was
a
utility
company
which
claimed
depreciation
deductions
with
respect
to
electric
power
lines
which
its
customers
have
been
required
to
pay
for
in
order
to
induce
the
company
to
provide
its
services
in
that
neighborhood.
the
court
held
the
taxpayer’s
customers
had
not
contributed
these
assets
to
taxpayer’s
capital.
justice
jackson
said
at
319
u.s.
102,
it
overtaxes
imagination
to
regard
to
the
farmers
and
other
customers
who
furnish
these
funds
as
makers
either
of
donations
or
contributions
to
capital.
the
payments
were
to
the
customer,
the
price
of
service.
then
in
1950,
seven
years
after
detroit
edison,
the
court
decided
the
second
case
construing
the
term
"contribution
to
capital"
in
the
context
of
non-shareholder
transfers
and
that
case
is
the
brown
shoe
co.
case
decided
at
339
u.s.
in
that
case
and
it
is
a
fairly
standard
model
for
a
whole
group
of
cases,
community
citizen
groups
which
were
intending
to
induce
taxpayer
to
locate
its
operations
in
that
community
for
the
purpose
of
generating
economic
benefit
to
the
community
donated
factory
buildings
and
other
assets
for
use
in
the
construction
of
the
taxpayer’s
basic
new
plant
facilities.
the
use
of
the
assets
was
unrestricted
except
that
they
were
to
be
used
in
the
taxpayer’s
business
at
that
location
for
a
specified
period
of
time.
the
court
in
that
case
noted
that
the
intent
of
the
community
groups
was
immediately
to
add
assets
to
taxpayer’s
working
capital
without
imposing
restrictions
and
the
court
held
that
the
transfer
is
“manifested
a
definite
purpose
to
enlarge
the
working
capital
of
the
company”
for
which
reason,
the
court
distinguished
the
detroit
edison
case
where
the
transfers
had
been
made
by
customers
for
compensation
for
service
and
it
held
that
the
transfers
constituted
depreciable
contributions
to
capital
under
the
1939
code.
now
where
is
this
case
fit
in
the
spectrum
between
detroit
edison
where
the
court
found
that
the
donations
were
intended
as
payment
for
services
rather
than
as
contributions
to
enlarge
the
taxpayer’s
capital.
in
brown
shoe
where
the
court
held
that
the
donations
made
to
induce
taxpayer
to
locate
its
plant
in
a
particular
area
were
intended
to
increase
the
taxpayer’s
capital.
the
court
of
claims
in
this
case,
recognized
that
the
governmental
agencies
which
contributed
to
the
highway
railroad
facilities
at
issue
or
let
us
more
properly
say
which
paid
for
the
facilities
at
issue,
did
not
intent
to
enlarge
respondent’s
working
capital
in
any
way.
for
the
court
specifically
found
that
“the
facilities
were
constructed
primarily
for
the
benefit
of
the
public
to
improve
safety
and
to
expedite
highway
traffic
flow
and
that
finding
is
at
page
57a
of
the
petition.
the
court
found
further
that
the
transferors
were
motivated
entirely
by
considerations
of
highway
safety
and
convenience
and
that
they
gave
no
consideration
to
respondent’s
need
for
capital.
nonetheless,
the
court
held
that
the
instant
case
was
controlled
by
brown
shoe
rather
than
by
detroit
edison
and
that
the
transfers
were
contributions
to
capital.
its
reasons
and
they
are
amplified
by
taxpayer
in
its
brief
reflecting
our
view
an
incorrect
interpretation
of
these
two
cases
and
an
excessively
broad
meaning
of
the
term
"contribution
to
capital."
to
begin
with,
both
the
court
of
claims
and
respondents
seize
upon
the
reference
in
detroit
edison
to
the
fact
that
the
power
lines
were
contributed
by
taxpayer’s
customers
in
order
to
obtain
taxpayer
services.
they
seize
upon
this
language
and
in
spite
of
the
court’s
emphasis
in
detroit
edison
on
the
lack
of
intention
to
enlarge
the
company’s
working
capital
they
would
restrict
the
application
of
that
holding
to
situations
where
the
properties
in
question
are
paid
for
as
compensation
for
services.
they
set
up
in
either
or
a
test.
conversely,
the
court
of
claims
and
respondent
would
read
brown
shoe
and
this
is
nearly
incredible
in
view
of
the
language
of
that
case
not
to
require
a
finding
of
intent
to
enlarge
taxpayer’s
capital.
under
their
argument,
a
transfer
to
a
corporation
without
obvious
consideration
constitutes
a
"contribution
to
capital"
unless
it
can
be
categorized
as
compensation
for
services.
this
is
a
very
broad
conception
of
the
term
"contribution
to
capital."
it’s
rather
cleverly
contrived
to
fit
the
facts
of
this
case
in
which
the
assets
would
clearly
and
as
the
court
of
claims
found
not
donated
with
the
intention
of
enlarging
or
contributing
to
taxpayer’s
capital,
but
in
which
the
pay
--
the
transfers
also
cannot
be
categorized
as
payment
for
services.
we
simply
do
not
see
how
this
conclusion
can
be
reconciled
with
the
opinions
in
these
cases
or
indeed
with
the
whole
statutory
scheme
governing
the
depreciation
deduction.
and
indeed
there
is
a
vital
aspect
of
the
case
bearing
quite
specifically
on
this
question
of
intention
which
is
ignored
by
the
court
of
claims
altogether,
for
which
makes
it
even
clearer
perhaps
than
in
the
detroit
edison
case
that
no
contribution
has
been
made
to
taxpayer
respondent’s
capital.
in
detroit
edison,
the
parallel
lines
which
the
taxpayer’s
customers
donated
to
it,
though
they
were
not
to
be
sure
of
transfered
with
the
intention
of
expanding
the
company’s
capital
were
at
least
assets
which
were
directly
beneficial
and
relevant
to
the
taxpayer’s
business,
assets
which
in
fact
made
a
substantial
addition
to
the
taxpayer’s
corporate
capital.
here
in
this
case
as
the
court
found,
the
assets
were
only
tangentially
related
to
respondent’s
business.
the
contribution
was
worth
very
little
to
the
extent
that
there
was
any
at
all.
though
increased
safety
at
highway
railroad
crossing
is
a
goal
that
no
one
presumably
would
oppose
it
is
not
especially
relevant
to
the
profitability
of
the
railroad
business,
a
fact
which
is
doubtless
reflected
in
the
railroad
company's
constant
resistance
to
sharing
in
the
cost
of
these
facilities.
this
resistance
is
what
resulted
in
congress’s
authorization
of
total
federal
reimbursement
for
the
facilities
subject
to
the
10%
maximum
payback
by
the
railroads.
and
indeed
this
is
perhaps,
the
most
significant
fact
in
the
case
to
the
extent
that
respondent
was
deemed
to
benefit
to
receive
any
tangible
benefit
from
the
construction
of
the
facilities
in
issue
here,
it
was
required
to
pay
for
them.
nothing
was
contributed,
whatever
the
respondent
was
deemed
to
have
benefited
from,
he
paid
for
it.
i
take
it
everyone
agrees
that
it
is
entitled
--
the
respondent
is
entitled
to
depreciate
any
portion
of
these
assets,
which
it
may
have
had
to
pay
for.
the
agreements
specified
as
i’ve
said
earlier,
that
this
benefit
was
not
to
exceed
10%
of
the
cost
of
the
facilities
and
this
is
presumably
a
reflection
of
the
party’s
judgment,
of
the
legislative
judgment
that
the
facilities
were
not
financially
important
to
the
railroads.
indeed
testimony
before
the
court
of
claims
hearing
commissioner
and
i
point
specifically
to
page
76
of
the
appendix,
indicated
that
the
railroads
frequently
asserted
in
arguing
how
much
of
the
cost
they
would
have
to
bear
that
the
benefit
they
enjoyed
amounted
really
to
only
1%
or
2%
of
the
total
cost
of
the
facilities
and
it
did
not
seem
to
matter
for
this
purpose
whether
the
facilities
of
the
type
directly
related
to
rail
use
or
the
type
directly
related
to
highway
use.
in
sum,
these
assets
with
respect
to
which
respondent
seeks
depreciation
now
were
neither
transferred
in
consideration
of
respondent
services
as
in
the
detroit
edison
nor
were
they
contributions
to
respondents
capital
as
in
brown
shoe.
the
railroads
and
the
governmental
agencies
here
have
merely
apportioned
among
themselves
the
costs
of
improving
traffic
flow
at
highway
railroad
intersections.
their
respective
shares
of
these
costs
reflect
the
relative
benefit
that
the
railroads
and
the
government
representing
the
people
respectively
derive
from
the
assets.
in
the
case
of
the
railroad,
this
is
not
much
benefit
and
so
the
railroads
don’t
pay
much.
but
neither
can
it
be
said
that
these
governmental
agencies
in
absorbing
the
share
of
the
costs
which
reflects
the
public's
interest
in
these
assets
it
cannot
be
said
that
they
have
contributed
or
donated
that
share
of
the
costs
to
respondent’s
capital.
essentially,
it
may
be
helpful
to
think
in
terms
in
which
respondent
and
these
agencies
are
simply
like
any
two
persons
who
share
a
cost
together
in
proportions
which
reflect
their
respective
interests
in
an
asset.
two
adjoining
land
on
this,
for
example,
may
decide
to
construct
the
fence
or
dig
a
well
together.
they
may
find
it
convenient
to
locate
the
fence
or
the
well
on
one
side
of
the
other
of
their
property
line.
presumably,
their
apportionment
of
the
cost
of
this
asset
that
will
reflect
their
respective
uses
of
the
facilities.
the
land
owner
on
his
side
of
the
line,
the
well
is
dug
or
the
fence
erected
has
certainly
not
received
a
donation
from
his
neighbor
and
cannot
include
his
neighbor’s
cost
in
this
depreciation
basis.
this
is
essentially,
we
believe,
the
nature
of
the
case
here.
we
would
add
finally
that
the
great
emphasis
placed
in
respondent’s
brief
on
the
fact
that
it
was
obligated
to
maintain
some
or
it
argues
all
of
the
facilities,
may
and
may
not
be
true
that
it
has
this
obligation,
but
it
is
irrelevant
to
the
question
of
appreciability
and
relevant
to
the
question
whether
this
is
a
"contribution
to
capital"
because
i
want
to
say
relevant,
the
question
is
certainly
not
depended
upon
it.
depreciation
as
it’s
well
known
is
an
expense
deduction
for
a
current
expense.
it
is
not
an
anticipation
of
a
future
expense
and
a
cost
which
the
tax
payer
has
never
incurred.
the
taxpayer
cites
in
this
regard
certain
cases
in
which
it
is
unclear
who
has
made
the
underlying
investment
in
equity
asset
and
in
those
cases
it
has
been
relevant
to
inquire
who
has
the
maintenance
obligation
and
so
far
as
that
sheds
evidence
on
the
question
who
is
the
underlying
owner
or
has
the
underlying
cost
the
basis
on
the
asset.
but
the
mere
obligation
to
undertake
a
speculative
future
expense
does
not
under
any
circumstances
give
rise
to
a
depreciation
deduction.
for
these
reasons,
we
believe
that
this
decision
ought
to
be
reversed.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
a
corporate
income
tax
case
here
on
the
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
claims.
the
sole
issue
presented
in
the
government’s
petition
for
certiorari
is
whether
the
respondent
railroad
is
entitled
to
take
depreciation
deductions
with
respect
to
certain
to
properties
paid
for
by
governmental
agencies
for
the
purpose
of
improving
safety
and
traffic
flow
at
highway
--
railroad
intersections.
the
issue
is
governed
as
i
shall
explain
by
provisions
of
the
internal
revenue
code
of
1939
which
are
no
longer
applicable
under
the
internal
revenue
code
of
1954.
the
resolution
of
this
question
of
construction
of
the
1939
code,
however,
will
continue
to
effect
tax
returns
filed
for
many
future
years,
especially
with
respect
to
the
railroading
utility
industries
because
the
relevant
amendments
to
the
1954
code
do
not
apply
to
properties
paid
for
as
for
those
in
issue
here
prior
to
1954
and
most
of
these
properties
have
very
long
useful
lives,
in
some
cases,
as
many
as
50
or
60
years.
the
background
of
the
properties
with
respect
to
which
respondent
seeks
depreciation
deductions
here
is
as
follows.
beginning
in
the
early
1930s,
respondent
and
many
other
railroads
entered
into
agreements
with
various
state
governments
for
construction
of
facilities
to
improve
the
safety
and
traffic
flow
conditions
at
highway-railroad
intersections.
the
initial
agreements
between
the
railroads
and
the
states
provided
that
the
states
would
substantially,
though
not
entirely,
reimburse
the
railroads
for
those
facilities
which
it
was
the
railroad’s
obligation
to
construct.
shortly
after
these
initial
agreements
were
reached,
congress
passed
a
series
of
statutes
which
authorized
the
federal
government
to
pay
at
least
part
of
the
state
share
of
the
construction
cost
of
these
facilities.
this
is
set
forth
in
the
national
industry
recovery
act
at
48
stat.
195,
section
203
and
is
a
1933
statute.
in
the
years
following
the
initial
agreements
and
the
initial
authorization
of
partial
federal
reimbursement
of
state
expenses,
the
railroads
who
presumably
felt
that
these
facilities
designed
to
improve
highway
traffic
conditions
were
tangential
to
the
profitable
operation
of
their
railroad
business
displayed
great
reluctance
to
share
substantially
in
the
construction
costs
and
disputes
between
the
railroads
and
the
states
were
quite
frequent
over
allocation
of
the
costs.
in
order
to
settle
these
disputes,
the
congress
passed
the
federal
highway
act
of
1944
which
was
basically
a
stepped
version
of
the
prior
act
and
this
act
authorized
the
federal
government
to
reimburse
the
states
for
the
entire
cost
of
the
facilities
such
as
those
at
issue
here,
subject
only
to
the
limitation
that
to
the
extent
that
the
railroad
was
deemed
to
receive
direct
benefit
from
these
facilities,
it
should
reimburse
the
federal
government
on
a
pro
rata
basis
up
to
a
maximum
of
10%
of
the
cost
of
any
particular
facility.
the
result
was
that
the
states
initially
absorbed
all
or
most
of
the
cost
of
the
facilities
for
which
they
were
reimbursed
by
the
federal
government
and
the
railroads
paid
only
so
much
as
was
deemed
to
reflect
the
benefit
which
the
railroad
derived
from
the
facilities
and
this
court
in
no
event
exceed
10%
of
the
cost.
now,
although
there
is
some
question
as
to
whether
respondents
or
the
states
have
title
to
the
facilities
under
the
terms
of
these
agreements.
the
agreements
do
provide
that
respondent
is
obligated
to
maintain
the
facilities
“directly
related
to
railroad
use,”
such
as
rail
bridges
and
roadbeds
and
tracks
and
the
states
are
correspondingly
required
maintain
the
facilities
directly
related
to
motor
vehicle
use
such
as
highway
bridges
and
approaches.
the
majority
of
the
court
of
claims
here
appears
to
have
assumed
that
the
obligation
to
maintain
these
facilities
includes
the
obligation
to
replace
worn
out
equipment.
judge
davis
found
that
questionable
proposition,
but
he
court
of
claims
appears
to
have
found
the
respondent
had
the
obligation
here
to
maintain
and
replace
those,
at
least
those
facilities,
most
directly
related
to
railroad
use.
and
at
this
point,
i
should
point
out
that
the
government
and
respondent
appear
to
be
in
some
disagreement
as
to
precisely
the
type
of
facilities
which
respondent
seeks
here
to
depreciate.
the
court
of
claims
did
not
make
a
specific
finding
as
to
what
percentage
of
the
facilities
at
issue
here
were
of
the
type
closely
related
to
the
railroad
business
and
correspondingly
what
percentage
were
closely
related
to
highway
use
and
this
would
bear
for
example,
upon
the
question
whether
respondent
was
obligated
to
maintain
and
replace
the
facilities
that
it
seeks
to
depreciate,
a
question
which
to
be
sure,
we
do
not
believe
to
be
dispositive
of
this
case.
the
court
did
find
and
this
finding
is
at
page
55a
of
our
certiorari
petition
that
about
a
million
and
a
half
or
a
somewhat
more
than
$2
million
of
property
at
issue
here,
was
in
the
category
of
“highway
under
crossings
or
highway
over
crossings.”
we
assumed
perhaps
in
some
haste,
that
highway
under
crossings
and
highway
over
crossings
referred
to
highway
facilities
over
railroad
tracks
and
concluded
on
that
basis
that
at
least
71%
of
the
amount
in
controversy
represented
facilities
in
the
category
most
directly
related
to
highway
use.
judge
davis
appears
to
have
assumed
the
same
thing
and
i
refer
you
in
that
connection
to
footnote
2
on
page
48a
of
the
petition.
respondent
now
asserts
in
his
brief
that
it
is
not
claiming
any
highway
structures
here
and
that
the
items
in
its
account
6
which
the
court
of
claims
described
as
highway
under
crossings
are
in
fact
railroad
bridges
of
some
sort.
in
this
connection,
it
cites
the
joint
exhibit
found
at
page
51
of
the
appendix
in
which
the
items
in
account
6
are
described
simply
as
bridges.
respondent
claims
that
the
bridges
in
this
account
are
all
rail
bridges
and
that
in
spite
of
the
finding
of
the
court
of
claims,
it
has
not
sought
to
depreciate
any
highway
under
crossings
or
over
crossings.
now,
our
examination
of
the
record
in
this
case
including
an
inspection
of
the
tax
returns
filed
by
respondent
does
not
provide
a
satisfactory
answer
to
the
question
whether
the
items
in
account
6
include
highway
crossings
and
if
so,
to
what
extent
and
the
litigation
as
i
think
quite
rightfully
not
focused
closely
on
this
point.
we
felt
it
is
desirable
to
bring
this
discrepancy
between
our
reading
of
the
record
and
respondent’s
assertion
to
the
court’s
attention,
but
for
reasons
which
i
shall
refer
to
several
times
in
the
course
of
this
argument,
hopefully,
our
position
is
in
no
way
dependent
upon
the
answer
to
the
question
whether
the
bulk
of
the
facilities
in
question
were
directly
related
to
highway
use
or
railway
use.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
i
think
it
is
right,
they
could
mr.
justice
rehnquist
and
in
that
connection,
it
may
have
been
hasty
of
us
to
assume
that
it
referred
to
highway
structures.
i
believe
judge
davis
assumed
the
same
thing
because
in
this
footnote
2
on
page
48a
of
the
petition,
he
refers
to
the
fact
that
three
quarters
of
the
structures
in
question
were
those
were
highway
over
crossings
or
under
crossings
and
that
part
of
the
agreements
between
the
states
and
the
railroads
included
the
condition
that
the
railroads
would
not
--
that
the
states
would
not
have
to
pay
for
an
easement
with
respect
to
those
structures.
and
i
assume
that
if
there
is
any
question
involving
the
state
applying
for
requiring
an
easement
in
order
to
make
the
construction
it
would
probably
refer
to
a
highway
construction
in
which
it
was
the
state's
obligation
to
constructing
not
a
rail
construction,
that
isn’t
crystal
clear
either.
in
any
event,
we
do
not
believe
that
this
is
at
all
dispositive
of
the
issues
in
the
case
and
i
shall
have
occasion
to
explain
why
in
the
course
of
the
argument.
i
want
to
bring
out
one
more
background
to
this
case.
in
the
series
of
events
described
at
length
in
our
brief
and
in
the
opinion
of
the
court
of
claims,
respondent
as
a
condition
to
obtaining
the
permission
of
the
internal
revenue
service
to
change
its
basic
depreciation
accounting
technique,
respondent
entered
into
a
terms
letter
agreement
with
the
internal
revenue
service
in
which
the
respondent
promised
among
other
things
that
it
would
not
take
depreciation
deductions
with
respect
to
properties
that
had
been
donated
to
it.
and
so
for
years,
respondent
declined
to
claim
depreciation
deductions
with
respect
to
the
assets
at
issue
here.
suddenly
in
1965,
respondent
brought
a
law
suit
in
the
court
of
claims
alleging
that
it
overpaid
its
income
tax
for
the
year
1955
and
that
is
the
year
at
issue
here
when
it
failed
to
take
depreciation
deductions
on
these
properties
paid
for
by
the
government.
and
the
court
of
claims
held
by
a
margin
of
four
to
three,
judge
davis
dissenting
vigorously
that
respondent
was
indeed
entitled
to
include
the
value
of
these
properties
in
its
depreciation
base
and
to
take
deductions
though
it
had
incurred
no
costs
in
the
acquisition
of
these
assets.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
yes,
there
are
mr.
justice
blackmun?
mr.
richard
b.
stone
i’m
not
sure
whether
all
of
them
do
mr.
justice
blackmun,
but
if
--
i
am
told
that
the
terms
letter
agreements
were
very
widespread
in
the
railroad
industry.
they
are
basically
involved,
the
post
second
world
war
changes
from
retirement
to
depreciation
accounting
and
i
am
told
that
that
was
such
a
widespread
practice
due
to
the
fact
there
was
such
low
retirements
and
high
profits
during
the
second
world
war
and
most
railroads
and
most
industries
generally,
did
their
accounting
on
the
basis
of
--
did
their
accounting
on
the
basis
of
retirement,
but
it
became
much
more
profitable
after
the
war
to
do
it
on
the
basis
of
straight
depreciation
technique.
but
i
don’t
know
specifically,
if
there
are
any
cases
backed
up
right
now
which
do
not
involve
the
terms
letter.
in
deciding
this
issue
in
respondent's
favor
the
court
of
claims
held
both
that
the
depreciation
deductions
were
allowable
on
the
applicable
provisions
of
the
1939
code
and
then
in
addition,
respondent
had
not
given
up
its
right
to
take
depreciation
deductions
on
donated
properties
when
it
entered
into
these
terms
letter
agreements.
it
is
our
position
that
even
if
the
1939
code
allowed
the
respondent
a
depreciation
deduction
in
these
circumstances
which
we
certainly
believe
it
did
not,
respondent
was
precluded
from
taking
these
deductions
as
a
result
of
the
binding
terms
letter
agreement
it
entered
into.
this
is
a
question
of
contract
interpretation
essentially.
it
is
quite
thoroughly
covered
in
our
brief
and
i
shall
focus
my
attention
in
this
argument
on
the
primary
question
with
respect
to
which
we
sought
certiorari
here
which
is
whether
the
respondent
is
entitled
under
the
terms
of
the
1939
code,
to
take
deductions
in
these
circumstances
for
the
depreciation
of
properties
in
which
it
has
incurred
no
cost.
the
fundamental
concept
of
the
depreciation
deduction
and
this
is
virtually
an
(inaudible)
since
its
inception
has
been
that
tax
payers
deduct
from
taxable
income
that
portion
of
their
assets
which
is
used
up
in
earning
that
income.
the
deduction
for
depreciation
is
essentially
an
expense
deduction.
it’s
designed
to
reflect
approximately
that
portion
of
a
taxpayer’s
expense
incurred
in
the
purchase
of
its
assets
which
is
attributable
to
the
production
of
income
in
any
particular
year.
accordingly,
both
the
1939
and
1954
internal
revenue
codes
provide
that
the
basis
on
which
depreciation
is
allowed
is
the
same
as
the
basis
for
determining
gain
or
loss
in
disposition
of
the
property
and
in
most
instances,
this
is
the
expense
that
the
taxpayer
has
incurred
in
purchasing
the
asset
which
is
of
course
the
taxpayer’s
cost.
if
an
asset
has
caused
the
taxpayer
nothing,
its
gradual
consumption
represents
no
expense
to
him
and
there
is
ordinarily
no
reason
to
give
him
an
expense
deduction.
now,
there
ought
to
be
sure
certain
refinements
of
the
general
rule
that
the
depreciation
basis
is
the
taxpayers
cost.
in
certain
situations
for
example,
the
tax
laws
have
historically
provided
that
a
taxpayer
to
whom
assets
are
transferred
in
certain
well
defined
types
of
transactions,
takes
over
the
basis
of
the
transferor
rather
than
acquiring
a
new
basis.
this
is
known
commonly
as
a
carryover
basis.
this
is
true
for
example
where
a
taxpayer
receives
property
in
a
transfer
which
the
code
characterizes
as
a
gift.
there
is
also
a
carryover
of
the
transferor's
basis
in
many
situations
in
which
property
is
transferred
to
a
corporation
by
its
shareholders
for
example.
section
358
of
the
internal
revenue
code
of
1954
provides
a
classic
example
of
carryover
basis
which
is
a
carryover
basis
for
property
transfer
to
a
corporation
in
a
section
351
transfer
which
is
transfer
in
exchange
for
stock
or
securities
in
a
corporation
controlled
by
the
transferors.
the
reasons
for
providing
a
carryover
basis
in
these
situations
are
various
and
they
are
quite
complex
and
would
not
fruitfully
be
explored
in
the
context
of
this
argument.
but
i
would
suggest
that
close
analysis
justifies
the
conclusion
that
these
provisions
do
not
really
represent
departures
from
the
notion
that
basis
is
fundamentally
a
function
of
cost.
rather
these
special
provisions
reflect
the
legislative
view
that
in
certain
circumstances,
well
defined
and
for
certain
reasons,
the
purposes
of
the
code
are
most
consistently
and
effectively
carried
out
when
the
basis
of
an
asset
is
unchanged
in
the
hands
of
a
transferee
or
if
you
will,
when
the
cost
basis
of
someone
else
other
than
the
transferee
taxpayer
is
the
most
appropriate
basis.
now,
what
is
the
situation
that
we
deal
with
here?
section
113
(a)
(8)
(b)
of
the
1939
code,
provided
that
corporate
taxpayers
could
take
over
that
transferor’s
basis,
a
carryover
basis,
in
this
case
to
be
sure
that
assets
we’re
dealing
with
are
new
and
so
that
the
question
is
not
one
of
whether
it
is
a
carryover
basis
or
a
taxpayer’s
cost
basis
because
those
are
one
of
the
same,
the
question
is
simply
whether
the
taxpayer
takes
over
any
basis
at
all
on
these
assets.
section
113
(a)
(8)
(b),
provided
that
corporate
taxpayers
could
take
the
transferor’s
basis
including
for
purposes
of
depreciation
in
property
transferred
as
“a
"contribution
to
capital"”
and
that
is
the
term
we
are
dealing
with
here.
ordinarily,
that
term
“"contribution
to
capital"”
refers
to
a
transfer
of
money
or
other
property
to
a
corporation
by
a
shareholder.
in
this
situation,
the
"contribution
to
capital"
is
quite
logically
considered
a
part
of
the
shareholder’s
investment
in
his
equity
interest
in
the
corporation
and
it’s
treated
much
the
same
way
as
consideration
paid
for
example
for
the
issuance
of
stock.
but
the
internal
revenue
code
of
1939
did
not
restrict
the
right
to
acquire
a
basis
and
correspondingly
to
depreciate
assets
donated
as
contributions
to
capital
--
to
assets
donated
by
shareholders.
it
simply
provided
that
the
corporation
acquired
the
transferor’s
basis
and
a
"contribution
to
capital."
consequently,
it
appears
that
the
1939
code
contemplated
that
non-shareholders
could
also
make
contributions
to
a
corporation’s
capital
and
that
the
corporation
could
take
over
the
transferor’s
basis
in
these
assets
for
depreciation
purposes.
significantly
by
virtue
of
this
court’s
holding
in
edwards
against
cuba
railroad
268
u.s.,
a
property
transferred
in
these
circumstances
was
held
not
to
constitute
income
to
the
transferee
corporation.
nonetheless,
under
the
1939
code,
corporate
taxpayers
who
received
the
donated
assets
which
could
be
categorized
as
contributions
to
capital,
were
able
to
take
depreciation
deductions
with
respect
to
these
assets
in
which
they
had
no
investment
and
which
they
had
received
entirely
for
income
tax
liability.
congress
changed
the
situation
when
it
enacted
the
internal
revenue
code
of
1954.
section
362
(c)
of
the
current
code
provides
that
contributions
to
capital
made
by
non-shareholders
after
june
1954
have
a
basis
of
zero
for
depreciation
and
other
purposes
in
the
hands
of
the
transferee,
so
that
the
basis
is
no
longer
carried
over
from
the
transferor.
but
for
cases
such
as
this
one
which
involved
assets
transferred
before
the
application
--
the
applicable
date
of
section
362,
it
is
still
necessary
to
inquire
whether
the
transfer
in
question
can
be
classified
as
a
"contribution
to
capital"
within
the
meeting
of
section
113
(a)
(8)
of
the
1939
code.
let
me
make
it
clear
that
we
are
not
in
any
way
whatsoever
implying
that
respondent
should
be
deprived
of
a
benefit
which
the
1939
code
provides
to
it.
we
are
not
attempting
to
make
the
amendments
contained
in
section
362
of
the
1954
code
retroactive
because
they
are
explicitly
made
prospective
in
application
only.
the
specific
issue
in
this
case,
however,
is
the
definition
of
the
term
"contribution
to
capital"
as
used
in
section
113
(a)
(8)
(b)
of
the
1939
code
and
that
term
is
not
defined
in
the
code.
as
i’ve
indicated,
it
is
a
term
ordinarily
associated
with
transfers
by
shareholders
or
persons
with
underlying
equity
interests
in
a
corporation.
the
question
in
this
case
is,
what
does
the
term
"contribution
to
capital"
mean
in
the
context
of
a
transfer
to
a
corporation
by
a
non-shareholder?
with
respect
to
this
question,
we
believe
that
it
is
highly
relevant
to
understand
that
the
allowance
of
a
depreciation
basis
in
this
circumstances
was
a
departure
from
the
traditional
notion
of
depreciation
as
a
reflection
of
expense
actually
incurred
as
an
asset
is
used
up
and
we
believe
it
is
reasonable
to
conclude
from
the
context
that
the
term
"contribution
to
capital"
was
not
intended
to
apply
to
all
transfers
made
to
a
corporation
without
immediately
apparent
consideration,
but
that
the
term
was
intended
to
have
a
rather
specific
meaning
and
it
is
that
meaning
which
we
are
attempting
to
uncover
here.
indeed,
we
submit
that
the
decisions
of
this
court
rendered
while
section
113
(a)
(8)
(b)
was
still
in
effect
have
interpreted
the
term
"contribution
to
capital"
in
the
context
of
non-shareholder
transfers
in
a
very
specific
and
limited
way.
essentially,
we
deal
with
two
cases
in
which
this
court
specifically
considered
whether
transfers
of
assets
to
a
corporation
by
a
non-shareholder
constituted
contributions
to
capital.
in
both
of
these
two
cases,
the
court
tested
the
assets
in
question
in
terms
of
the
donative
intent
of
the
transferor.
specifically
in
terms
of
whether
the
transferor’s
intention
was
to
increase
the
corporation’s
capital,
whether
he
was
making
a
contribution
to
the
corporation’s
capital.
thus,
in
the
detroit
edison
case,
decided
in
1943
at
319
u.s.,
the
taxpayer
was
a
utility
company
which
claimed
depreciation
deductions
with
respect
to
electric
power
lines
which
its
customers
have
been
required
to
pay
for
in
order
to
induce
the
company
to
provide
its
services
in
that
neighborhood.
the
court
held
the
taxpayer’s
customers
had
not
contributed
these
assets
to
taxpayer’s
capital.
justice
jackson
said
at
319
u.s.
102,
it
overtaxes
imagination
to
regard
to
the
farmers
and
other
customers
who
furnish
these
funds
as
makers
either
of
donations
or
contributions
to
capital.
the
payments
were
to
the
customer,
the
price
of
service.
then
in
1950,
seven
years
after
detroit
edison,
the
court
decided
the
second
case
construing
the
term
"contribution
to
capital"
in
the
context
of
non-shareholder
transfers
and
that
case
is
the
brown
shoe
co.
case
decided
at
339
u.s.
in
that
case
and
it
is
a
fairly
standard
model
for
a
whole
group
of
cases,
community
citizen
groups
which
were
intending
to
induce
taxpayer
to
locate
its
operations
in
that
community
for
the
purpose
of
generating
economic
benefit
to
the
community
donated
factory
buildings
and
other
assets
for
use
in
the
construction
of
the
taxpayer’s
basic
new
plant
facilities.
the
use
of
the
assets
was
unrestricted
except
that
they
were
to
be
used
in
the
taxpayer’s
business
at
that
location
for
a
specified
period
of
time.
the
court
in
that
case
noted
that
the
intent
of
the
community
groups
was
immediately
to
add
assets
to
taxpayer’s
working
capital
without
imposing
restrictions
and
the
court
held
that
the
transfer
is
“manifested
a
definite
purpose
to
enlarge
the
working
capital
of
the
company”
for
which
reason,
the
court
distinguished
the
detroit
edison
case
where
the
transfers
had
been
made
by
customers
for
compensation
for
service
and
it
held
that
the
transfers
constituted
depreciable
contributions
to
capital
under
the
1939
code.
now
where
is
this
case
fit
in
the
spectrum
between
detroit
edison
where
the
court
found
that
the
donations
were
intended
as
payment
for
services
rather
than
as
contributions
to
enlarge
the
taxpayer’s
capital.
in
brown
shoe
where
the
court
held
that
the
donations
made
to
induce
taxpayer
to
locate
its
plant
in
a
particular
area
were
intended
to
increase
the
taxpayer’s
capital.
the
court
of
claims
in
this
case,
recognized
that
the
governmental
agencies
which
contributed
to
the
highway
railroad
facilities
at
issue
or
let
us
more
properly
say
which
paid
for
the
facilities
at
issue,
did
not
intent
to
enlarge
respondent’s
working
capital
in
any
way.
for
the
court
specifically
found
that
“the
facilities
were
constructed
primarily
for
the
benefit
of
the
public
to
improve
safety
and
to
expedite
highway
traffic
flow
and
that
finding
is
at
page
57a
of
the
petition.
the
court
found
further
that
the
transferors
were
motivated
entirely
by
considerations
of
highway
safety
and
convenience
and
that
they
gave
no
consideration
to
respondent’s
need
for
capital.
nonetheless,
the
court
held
that
the
instant
case
was
controlled
by
brown
shoe
rather
than
by
detroit
edison
and
that
the
transfers
were
contributions
to
capital.
its
reasons
and
they
are
amplified
by
taxpayer
in
its
brief
reflecting
our
view
an
incorrect
interpretation
of
these
two
cases
and
an
excessively
broad
meaning
of
the
term
"contribution
to
capital."
to
begin
with,
both
the
court
of
claims
and
respondents
seize
upon
the
reference
in
detroit
edison
to
the
fact
that
the
power
lines
were
contributed
by
taxpayer’s
customers
in
order
to
obtain
taxpayer
services.
they
seize
upon
this
language
and
in
spite
of
the
court’s
emphasis
in
detroit
edison
on
the
lack
of
intention
to
enlarge
the
company’s
working
capital
they
would
restrict
the
application
of
that
holding
to
situations
where
the
properties
in
question
are
paid
for
as
compensation
for
services.
they
set
up
in
either
or
a
test.
conversely,
the
court
of
claims
and
respondent
would
read
brown
shoe
and
this
is
nearly
incredible
in
view
of
the
language
of
that
case
not
to
require
a
finding
of
intent
to
enlarge
taxpayer’s
capital.
under
their
argument,
a
transfer
to
a
corporation
without
obvious
consideration
constitutes
a
"contribution
to
capital"
unless
it
can
be
categorized
as
compensation
for
services.
this
is
a
very
broad
conception
of
the
term
"contribution
to
capital."
it’s
rather
cleverly
contrived
to
fit
the
facts
of
this
case
in
which
the
assets
would
clearly
and
as
the
court
of
claims
found
not
donated
with
the
intention
of
enlarging
or
contributing
to
taxpayer’s
capital,
but
in
which
the
pay
--
the
transfers
also
cannot
be
categorized
as
payment
for
services.
we
simply
do
not
see
how
this
conclusion
can
be
reconciled
with
the
opinions
in
these
cases
or
indeed
with
the
whole
statutory
scheme
governing
the
depreciation
deduction.
and
indeed
there
is
a
vital
aspect
of
the
case
bearing
quite
specifically
on
this
question
of
intention
which
is
ignored
by
the
court
of
claims
altogether,
for
which
makes
it
even
clearer
perhaps
than
in
the
detroit
edison
case
that
no
contribution
has
been
made
to
taxpayer
respondent’s
capital.
in
detroit
edison,
the
parallel
lines
which
the
taxpayer’s
customers
donated
to
it,
though
they
were
not
to
be
sure
of
transfered
with
the
intention
of
expanding
the
company’s
capital
were
at
least
assets
which
were
directly
beneficial
and
relevant
to
the
taxpayer’s
business,
assets
which
in
fact
made
a
substantial
addition
to
the
taxpayer’s
corporate
capital.
here
in
this
case
as
the
court
found,
the
assets
were
only
tangentially
related
to
respondent’s
business.
the
contribution
was
worth
very
little
to
the
extent
that
there
was
any
at
all.
though
increased
safety
at
highway
railroad
crossing
is
a
goal
that
no
one
presumably
would
oppose
it
is
not
especially
relevant
to
the
profitability
of
the
railroad
business,
a
fact
which
is
doubtless
reflected
in
the
railroad
company's
constant
resistance
to
sharing
in
the
cost
of
these
facilities.
this
resistance
is
what
resulted
in
congress’s
authorization
of
total
federal
reimbursement
for
the
facilities
subject
to
the
10%
maximum
payback
by
the
railroads.
and
indeed
this
is
perhaps,
the
most
significant
fact
in
the
case
to
the
extent
that
respondent
was
deemed
to
benefit
to
receive
any
tangible
benefit
from
the
construction
of
the
facilities
in
issue
here,
it
was
required
to
pay
for
them.
nothing
was
contributed,
whatever
the
respondent
was
deemed
to
have
benefited
from,
he
paid
for
it.
i
take
it
everyone
agrees
that
it
is
entitled
--
the
respondent
is
entitled
to
depreciate
any
portion
of
these
assets,
which
it
may
have
had
to
pay
for.
the
agreements
specified
as
i’ve
said
earlier,
that
this
benefit
was
not
to
exceed
10%
of
the
cost
of
the
facilities
and
this
is
presumably
a
reflection
of
the
party’s
judgment,
of
the
legislative
judgment
that
the
facilities
were
not
financially
important
to
the
railroads.
indeed
testimony
before
the
court
of
claims
hearing
commissioner
and
i
point
specifically
to
page
76
of
the
appendix,
indicated
that
the
railroads
frequently
asserted
in
arguing
how
much
of
the
cost
they
would
have
to
bear
that
the
benefit
they
enjoyed
amounted
really
to
only
1%
or
2%
of
the
total
cost
of
the
facilities
and
it
did
not
seem
to
matter
for
this
purpose
whether
the
facilities
of
the
type
directly
related
to
rail
use
or
the
type
directly
related
to
highway
use.
in
sum,
these
assets
with
respect
to
which
respondent
seeks
depreciation
now
were
neither
transferred
in
consideration
of
respondent
services
as
in
the
detroit
edison
nor
were
they
contributions
to
respondents
capital
as
in
brown
shoe.
the
railroads
and
the
governmental
agencies
here
have
merely
apportioned
among
themselves
the
costs
of
improving
traffic
flow
at
highway
railroad
intersections.
their
respective
shares
of
these
costs
reflect
the
relative
benefit
that
the
railroads
and
the
government
representing
the
people
respectively
derive
from
the
assets.
in
the
case
of
the
railroad,
this
is
not
much
benefit
and
so
the
railroads
don’t
pay
much.
but
neither
can
it
be
said
that
these
governmental
agencies
in
absorbing
the
share
of
the
costs
which
reflects
the
public's
interest
in
these
assets
it
cannot
be
said
that
they
have
contributed
or
donated
that
share
of
the
costs
to
respondent’s
capital.
essentially,
it
may
be
helpful
to
think
in
terms
in
which
respondent
and
these
agencies
are
simply
like
any
two
persons
who
share
a
cost
together
in
proportions
which
reflect
their
respective
interests
in
an
asset.
two
adjoining
land
on
this,
for
example,
may
decide
to
construct
the
fence
or
dig
a
well
together.
they
may
find
it
convenient
to
locate
the
fence
or
the
well
on
one
side
of
the
other
of
their
property
line.
presumably,
their
apportionment
of
the
cost
of
this
asset
that
will
reflect
their
respective
uses
of
the
facilities.
the
land
owner
on
his
side
of
the
line,
the
well
is
dug
or
the
fence
erected
has
certainly
not
received
a
donation
from
his
neighbor
and
cannot
include
his
neighbor’s
cost
in
this
depreciation
basis.
this
is
essentially,
we
believe,
the
nature
of
the
case
here.
we
would
add
finally
that
the
great
emphasis
placed
in
respondent’s
brief
on
the
fact
that
it
was
obligated
to
maintain
some
or
it
argues
all
of
the
facilities,
may
and
may
not
be
true
that
it
has
this
obligation,
but
it
is
irrelevant
to
the
question
of
appreciability
and
relevant
to
the
question
whether
this
is
a
"contribution
to
capital"
because
i
want
to
say
relevant,
the
question
is
certainly
not
depended
upon
it.
depreciation
as
it’s
well
known
is
an
expense
deduction
for
a
current
expense.
it
is
not
an
anticipation
of
a
future
expense
and
a
cost
which
the
tax
payer
has
never
incurred.
the
taxpayer
cites
in
this
regard
certain
cases
in
which
it
is
unclear
who
has
made
the
underlying
investment
in
equity
asset
and
in
those
cases
it
has
been
relevant
to
inquire
who
has
the
maintenance
obligation
and
so
far
as
that
sheds
evidence
on
the
question
who
is
the
underlying
owner
or
has
the
underlying
cost
the
basis
on
the
asset.
but
the
mere
obligation
to
undertake
a
speculative
future
expense
does
not
under
any
circumstances
give
rise
to
a
depreciation
deduction.
for
these
reasons,
we
believe
that
this
decision
ought
to
be
reversed.
