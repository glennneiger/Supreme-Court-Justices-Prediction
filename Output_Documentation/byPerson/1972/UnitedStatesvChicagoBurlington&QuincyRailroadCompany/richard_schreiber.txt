mr.
richard
schreiber
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
we
feel
that
the
significant
difference
in
the
factual
approach
taken
by
petitioner
and
respondent
is
decisive
of
the
outcome
of
this
case.
we
submit
that
the
obligation
of
replacement
of
these
facilities
is
the
critical
factor
in
a
determination
as
to
whether
or
not
respondent
is
entitled
to
these
depreciation
deductions.
the
finding
of
the
court
below
is
clear
that
respondent
have
this
obligation
in
connection
with
the
173
facilities
that
we
are
talking
about
here
today.
now,
what
are
these
facilities?
they
are
simply
railroad
bridges,
rail
crossing
protective
devices
that
are
located
on
respondent’s
right
of
way,
which
he
has
the
obligation
to
maintain
and
to
replace.
now,
we
say
we
have
the
legal
obligation
of
replacement
of
these
facilities.
in
addition,
we
have
a
very
real
practical
obligation
because
the
rail
bridge
over
the
public
highway
is
a
vital
link
in
our
transportation
system.
if
we
are
furnishing
common
carrier
service
to
the
public,
each
one
of
these
locations
is
essential
to
that
operation.
therefore,
we
feel
that
there
is
a
definite
need
to
set
up
a
depreciation
reserve
both
from
an
accounting
standpoint
in
order
to
anticipate
replacement
and
from
the
very
real
practical
situation
of
replacing
these
bridges
if
they
became
inoperable
and
needed
replacement.
mr.
richard
schreiber
i
don’t
believe
it
appears
mr.
justice
stewart,
but
i
think
it
probably
could
be
assumed
if
they
want
to
continue
in
business
that
they
would
have
to
replace
this
facility
although,
it
was
not
part
of
the
agreement
between
the
prospective
customer
and
the
detroit
edison
company.
mr.
richard
schreiber
yes
they
did
mr.
justice.
mr.
richard
schreiber
they
had
--
mr.
richard
schreiber
not
in
the
detroit
edison
case
mr.
justice,
but
we
feel
that
the
legal
obligation
and
the
practical
obligation
of
replacement
that
we
have
makes
our
case
more
persuasive
for
justifying
a
claim
for
depreciation
deductions
on
113
(a)
(8)
(b)
than
the
brown
shoe
case.
mr.
richard
schreiber
no,
because
of
the
overriding
considerations
that
the
payments
from
the
prospective
customers
in
detroit
edison.
mr.
richard
schreiber
right.
mr.
richard
schreiber
yes
that’s
true.
mr.
richard
schreiber
we
feel
that
the
teaching
of
the
brown
shoe
case
was
that
the
contributions
made
by
the
local
citizen
proves
to
the
brown
shoe
company
was
to
benefit
the
public
at
large.
mr.
richard
schreiber
in
other
words,
the
--
to
create
additional
job
opportunities
with
--
mr.
richard
schreiber
yes.
and
the
means
they
used
to
achieve
this
public
purpose
was
to
make
these
contributions
to
the
working
capital
of
the
taxpayer.
we
feel
that
that
is
strictly
analogous
to
the
factual
situation
we
have
here.
the
primary
purpose
of
the
federal-aid
highway
act
was
to
benefit
the
public
at
large
by
enlarging
the
network
of
highways
and
also
to
increase
safety
at
these
intersections
between
highways
and
railroads.
now
the
means
that
the
government
chose
to
use
to
reach
this
laudable
objective
was
to
make
these
contributions
to
this
taxpayer
in
order
to
benefit
the
public,
but
in
so
doing
did
so
by
contributing
to
our
working
capital.
in
fact,
i
might
enlarge
on
that
just
a
bit.
the
agreements
between
the
respondent
that
was
with
the
local
or
state
governmental
unit
provided
for
the
construction
of
these
railroad
bridges
and
these
rail
crossing
protective
devices
and
subsequent
to
that,
the
respondent
taxpayer
was
then
reimbursed
in
cash
through
the
federal-aid
highway
program.
so,
the
initial
expenditure
was
out
of
respondent’s
working
capital
to
fund
the
construction
of
these
projects
and
then
this
cash
that
went
to
the
construction
of
these
facilities
was
reimbursed
directly
into
respondent’s
working
capital.
mr.
richard
schreiber
well
--
mr.
richard
schreiber
the
industry
tracks
if
the
payment
is
made
initially
by
the
prospective
customer
without
any
right
of
reimbursement
that
money
would
never
appear
in
the
respondent’s
accounts
because
it
is
assumed
that
the
prospect
of
customers
paying
for
that
right
to
have
the
track
in
there
to
serve
his
business.
mr.
richard
schreiber
that
is
more
like
detroit
edison
than
the
instant
fact
situation,
yes
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
richard
schreiber
the
spur
track
situation?
it’s
different
because
there,
the
prospective
customer
is
making
payment
in
order
to
obtain
services
that
might
not
otherwise
be
available
to
him.
unless
there
is
a
legal
obligation
on
the
respondent
to
construct
the
facility,
it’s
within
its
his
discretion
as
to
whether
or
not
it
will
do
so
and
that
is
comparable
to
the
detroit
edison
case.
here,
mr.
chief
justice,
we
have
a
situation
where
this
respondent
railroad
had
a
preexisting
legal
obligation
to
construct
these
facilities
in
accordance
with
the
laws
of
the
states
in
which
we
operated.
the
state
regulatory
commissions
did
and
frequently
did
issue
orders
requiring
railroads
to
construct
these
types
of
facilities
on
their
property.
generally,
that
was
done
as
a
result
of
a
petition
from
residents
of
the
local
community
if
they
wanted
a
signal
light
or
a
crossing
gate
at
particular
location
in
their
town
and
they
would
go
down
to
the
state
public
service
commission
and
as
a
result
of
the
proceedings
there
we
were
frequently
ordered
as
the
record
below
indicates
to
construct
these
facilities.
so,
there
was
a
preexisting
legal
obligation
on
respond
it
to
construct
these
facilities,
which
distinguishes
it
from
the
situation
in
detroit
edison
case
and
from
the
situation
with
regard
to
the
spur
track.
mr.
richard
schreiber
the
title
would
be
dependent
on
whether
or
not
the
track
was
certainly
on
the
prospective
customer’s
property
or
whether
it
was
on
railroad
right
of
way.
if
it
was
on
railroad
right
of
way,
the
title
would
--
legal
title
would
assume
to
be
on
the
railroad.
but
if
it
was
on
as
most
of
the
siding
tracks
for
serving
customers'
plant
facilities
are
located
within
that
particular
plant
facility
area.
mr.
richard
schreiber
probably
the
lead
in
mr.
chief
justice,
would
be
in
order
to
get
in
to
the
property
line.
mr.
richard
schreiber
well,
the
prospective
company
would
only
be
paying
for
the
track
that’s
located
on
its
property,
in
other
words,
a
side
track
up
to
a
door
inside
of
its
building
in
order
to
serve
that
particular
company.
the
--
what
we
call
a
turnout
from
the
rail
track
off
the
railroad
right
of
way
to
the
property
line
of
plant
would
be
our
cost
and
of
course
the
--
mr.
richard
schreiber
maybe
in
regard
to
the
possible
reconstruction
of
the
bridges
and
crossing
signal
protection
devices?
well,
if
that
were
to
be
the
case
and
of
course
we
certainly
hope
that
won’t
be
the
case
in
connection
with
tax
payer
that
would
be
the
situation
that
would
have
to
be
determined
at
that
time.
but,
as
of
today
--
mr.
richard
schreiber
could
they
mr.
justice
i
don’t
have
the
answer
to
that
question
whether
they
could
or
not
if
like
congressional
act
--
mr.
richard
schreiber
from
the
standpoint
and
the
perspective
of
fairness,
it
might
very
well
be
fair
and
reasonable
if
at
some
future
date
due
to
a
collapse
of
a
particular
railroad
the
obligation
was
placed
back
on
the
government
to
replace
these
facilities
to
offset
the
depreciation
deductions
claimed.
however,
at
that
situation
--
mr.
richard
schreiber
pardon
me?
mr.
richard
schreiber
well,
it’s
gone
in
the
sense
that
it
was
available
to
the
tax
payer.
but
if
in
your
situation,
the
tax
payer
railroad
is
becoming
bankrupt,
it
wouldn’t
have
any
taxable
income
so
it
wouldn’t
be
able
to
achieve
any
benefit
from
the
deduction.
mr.
richard
schreiber
well,
as
long
as
its
still
viable
--
mr.
richard
schreiber
this,
the
federal-aid
highway
act
of
1933
and
the
subsequent
amendments
there
to
were
provided
for
the
primary
purpose
of
benefiting
the
public
by
enlarging
a
highway
network
and
also
to
provide
these
safety
facilities
that
--
mr.
richard
schreiber
the
taxpayer
claiming
his
legitimate
right
to
depreciation
deductions
is
exercising
the
rights
as
provided
by
statute.
mr.
richard
schreiber
but
the
project
itself
has
the
primary
purpose
to
benefit
the
public
although
that
is
true.
as
i’ve
indicated
before
the
question
is
the
means
that
were
utilized
to
achieve
this
primary
purpose.
mr.
richard
schreiber
in
regards
to
the
track
itself.
the
track
is
a
non
depreciable
item
from
the
standpoint
of
straight
line
depreciation.
so,
therefore,
the
depreciation
on
the
tracks
is
not
an
issue
here,
it's
only
those
items
that
we
claim
are
entitled
to
straight
line.
mr.
richard
schreiber
under
straight-line
depreciation.
they
are
under
retirement
accountings,
mr.
justice.
now,
we
submit
that
the
issue
here
involves
clearly
and
simply
a
question
of
the
proper
statutory
construction
of
section
113
of
the
1939
internal
revenue
code.
now
the
section,
we
are
relying
upon
is
section
113
(a)
(8)
(b),
which
provides
for
the
transferee
to
assume
the
basis
of
the
transferor
on
payments
made
by
shareholders
as
paid
in
surplus
or
from
any
other
person
as
spelled
out
in
the
regulation
and
in
the
statute
itself.
now,
this
distinguishes
the
situation
furthermore,
from
the
detroit
edison
case
because
under
section
113
(a)
(8)
(b),
there
is
no
necessity
for
a
requirement
of
donative
intent
as
there
would
be
under
section
113
(a)
(2),
which
is
the
gift
provision
and
permits
the
donee
to
acquire
of
a
donor’s
basis.
the
donative
intent
only
is
of
significance
in
connection
with
an
interpretation
of
113
(a)
(2).
now
as
i
have
indicated
previously,
we
feel
that
this
case
is
controlled
by
this
court’s
1950
decision
in
the
brown
shoe
case.
now,
the
logic
and
the
rationale
of
this
court’s
decision
in
the
brown
shoe
case
is
equally
applicable
in
connection
with
our
case.
the
facts
are
parallel.
the
primary
intent
was
to
benefit
the
public
at
large,
both
in
brown
shoe
and
in
this
case.
secondly,
the
payments
in
the
brown
shoe
case
and
in
this
case
were
not
payments
for
goods
or
services
to
be
rendered
as
they
were
in
the
detroit
edison
case.
mr.
richard
schreiber
that’s
correct
mr.
chief
justice
that
the
–
mr.
richard
schreiber
that’s
not
the
same
factual
situation
here
because
we
had
this
preexisting
legal
obligation
to
construct
these
facilities,
yes
sir?
mr.
richard
schreiber
that’s
why
we
feel
mr.
chief
justice
that
the
facts
in
this
case
are
more
persuasive
to
justify
a
claim
under
section
113
(a)
(8)
(b).
brown
shoe
company
agreed
to
maintain
this
new
facility
or
the
renovated
facility
within
that
community
only
for
an
initial
period
of
10
years.
now
at
the
expiration
of
that
ten-year
period,
the
brown
shoe
company
could
pick
up
and
move
on
and
conceivably
they
did.
here,
we
had
the
obligation
of
replacement
on
a
continuing
basis
if
we
intended
to
continue
an
operation
as
an
interstate
railroad.
that
as
i
was
indicating
is
the
distinguishing
characteristics
we
feel
between
detroit
edison
on
the
one
hand
and
brown
shoe
and
on
the
factual
situation
in
this
case
on
the
other
hand.
now,
as
mentioned
briefly
in
partitioner's
argument,
as
part
of
the
over-all
revision
of
the
1954
internal
revenue
code,
section
362
(c)
was
added
to
apply
a
zero
basis
to
these
types
of
contributions,
but
to
do
so
on
a
prospective
fashion
only
as
to
those
facilities
constructed
subsequent
to
june
22,
1954
and
facilities
that
we’re
talking
about
here
today,
these
rail
bridges,
these
rail
crossing
safety
devices
were
all
constructed
prior
to
the
cut
off
date
provided
for
in
section
362
(c)
of
the
1954
code.
it
is
clear
also,
from
the
legislative
history
of
section
362
(c),
that
it
was
intended
to
overcome
the
effect
of
the
brown
shoe
case,
but
to
do
so
on
a
prospective
fashion
only.
congress
had
it
within
its
discretion
to
apply
this
revision
on
the
code
provided
for
in
section
362
(c)
both
in
a
retroactive
manner
if
it
deemed
prudent
and
advisable
or
in
a
prospective
manner.
they
chose
to
do
it
on
a
prospective
fashion
only.
now,
the
commissioner
and
the
government
are
coming
in
to
court
here
and
saying
that
regardless
of
what
the
congressional
intent
was
this
54
code
revision
should
now
be
applied
retroactively
to
factual
situations
that
the
congress
specifically
excluded
when
it
amended
the
code.
now,
i
think
it’s
clear
that
as
a
general
principle
of
law,
no
retroactive
effect
is
to
be
given
to
a
statutory
amendment
unless
it
is
explicitly
required
by
the
terms
and
conditions
of
that
statutory
amendment.
here,
the
case
is
quite
to
the
contrary
that
it
was
to
operate
prospectively
only.
therefore,
we
assert
that
our
rights
to
these
depreciation
deductions
have
matured
exclusively
under
section
113
of
the
1939
code
and
specifically
section
(a)
(8)
(b).
finally,
i
just
like
to
touch
briefly
on
the
so-called
terms
letter
defense
petitioner
which
we
have
been
faced
with
throughout
the
trial
of
the
case
in
the
court
of
claims
and
on
appeal
to
the
court
below.
petitioner
asserts
that
certain
illustrative
language
out
of
the
so-called
memo
58
guidelines
is
a
bar
to
our
claim
for
depreciation
deductions
in
this
case.
briefly,
what
transpired
here
is
that
in
1944,
pursuant
to
a
request
by
the
taxpayer
for
a
change
over
in
method
of
depreciation
accounting
from
--
retirement
accounting
to
straight-line
depreciation
accounting
revised
or
schedules
were
submitted
to
the
internal
revenue
service
and
an
offer
of
a
terms
letter
agreement,
a
consent
of
this
change
over
in
accounting
was
sent
to
the
taxpayer.
included
in
that
terms
letter
in
1945
was
the
document
that
has
been
referred
to
as
memo
58
guidelines.
it's
our
position,
number
one,
that
the
memo
58
guidelines
were
never
a
part
of
the
terms
letter
agreement
between
respondent
and
the
commissioner.
they
were
not
incorporated
either
by
reference
or
otherwise
into
the
terms
letter
offer
between
respondent
and
commissioner.
then,
upon
receipt
of
the
terms
letter
offer
from
the
commissioner,
respondent
replied
with
a
qualified
acceptance
indicating
that
in
the
event
that
any
of
the
terms
and
conditions
should
be
changed
by
statutory
amendment,
by
operation
of
law
or
otherwise,
that
the
taxpayer
would
not
be
precluded
from
the
benefits
of
such
changes.
now,
considering
the
status
of
the
law
in
regard
to
these
depreciation
deductions
in
1945,
it’s
clear
why
these
were
not
included
in
the
schedule
submitted
by
respondent
to
the
commissioner
of
internal
revenue.
in
1943,
this
court
decided
the
detroit
edison
case
and
subsequent
to
that
decision,
the
commissioner
began
to
disallow
depreciation
deductions
to
the
brown
shoe
company
based
on
the
detroit
edison
case.
that’s
what
initiated
the
lawsuit
by
the
brown
shoe
company
to
be
allowed
to
claim
these
depreciation
deductions
and
that
issue
was
resolved
by
this
court
in
1950.
so,
from
the
period
from
1943
to
1950,
it
was
the
position
of
the
commissioner
and
the
government
that
nobody
was
entitled
to
any
depreciation
deductions
on
contributions
to
capital
similar
to
those
at
issue
in
brown
shoe
and
here.
therefore,
it
would
have
been
a
meaningless
act
for
us
to,
as
a
result
of
a
request
for
change
over
in
accounting
raise
the
issue
when
that
was
the
current
understanding
of
the
commissioner
and
the
government.
the
terms
letter
itself
and
the
memo
58
both
specifically
were
qualified
to
indicate
that
depreciation
was
to
be
in
accordance
with
section
113
of
the
1939
internal
revenue
code
and
the
regulations
issued
there
under.
therefore,
once
it
became
clear
as
a
result
of
this
court’s
decision
on
the
brown
shoe
case
that
contributions
of
this
nature
were
properly
depreciable.
it
affected
a
change
in
the
terms
and
conditions
of
the
terms
letter
agreement
between
respondent
and
commissioner
and
justified
our
claim
for
depreciation
deductions
even
if
the
memo
58
guidelines
could
be
considered
as
even
partially
incorporated
into
the
terms
letter
offer
from
the
commissioner
to
respondent.
finally,
in
conclusion,
respondent
would
like
to
assert
that
it's
a
very
simple
factual
situation
we
are
dealing
with
here
in
this
case.
what
we’re
talking
about
are
railroad
bridges,
rail
safety
facilities
that
are
directly
related
to
the
operation
of
plaintiff’s
railroad
that
we
have
the
legal
and
practical
obligation
of
replacement
of
these
facilities
if
as
we
do
continue
to
desire
to
stay
in
business
as
an
interstate
railroad.
further,
that
the
government
should
not
be
allowed
as
result
of
this
litigation
to
apply
a
statutory
amendment
in
a
retroactive
fashion
when
congress
of
although
it
had
it
within
its
discretion
to
do
so
failed
to
do
so.
and
finally,
we
assert
that
the
so-called
terms
letter
defense
cannot
be
successfully
used
to
defeat
a
valid
claim
of
this
taxpayer
on
a
substantive
issue
of
its
entitlement
to
depreciation
deductions
when
the
illustrative
language
relied
upon
by
petitioner
is
included
in
a
memo
58
guideline
enclosure
to
the
terms
letter
agreement,
which
is
qualified
by
providing
that
all
applicable
sections
of
the
39
code
will
govern
the
situation
in
regard
to
depreciation.
and
when
respondent’s
acceptance
of
the
terms
letter
agreement
was
so
qualified
to
preserve
its
legal
rights
to
contest
the
legitimacy
of
these
depreciation
deductions
in
a
proper
form
by
a
timely
claim
for
refund,
which
is
precisely
what
the
respondent
did
successfully
both
in
the
trial
court
and
before
the
court
of
claims
on
review.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
richard
schreiber
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
we
feel
that
the
significant
difference
in
the
factual
approach
taken
by
petitioner
and
respondent
is
decisive
of
the
outcome
of
this
case.
we
submit
that
the
obligation
of
replacement
of
these
facilities
is
the
critical
factor
in
a
determination
as
to
whether
or
not
respondent
is
entitled
to
these
depreciation
deductions.
the
finding
of
the
court
below
is
clear
that
respondent
have
this
obligation
in
connection
with
the
173
facilities
that
we
are
talking
about
here
today.
now,
what
are
these
facilities?
they
are
simply
railroad
bridges,
rail
crossing
protective
devices
that
are
located
on
respondent’s
right
of
way,
which
he
has
the
obligation
to
maintain
and
to
replace.
now,
we
say
we
have
the
legal
obligation
of
replacement
of
these
facilities.
in
addition,
we
have
a
very
real
practical
obligation
because
the
rail
bridge
over
the
public
highway
is
a
vital
link
in
our
transportation
system.
if
we
are
furnishing
common
carrier
service
to
the
public,
each
one
of
these
locations
is
essential
to
that
operation.
therefore,
we
feel
that
there
is
a
definite
need
to
set
up
a
depreciation
reserve
both
from
an
accounting
standpoint
in
order
to
anticipate
replacement
and
from
the
very
real
practical
situation
of
replacing
these
bridges
if
they
became
inoperable
and
needed
replacement.
mr.
richard
schreiber
i
don’t
believe
it
appears
mr.
justice
stewart,
but
i
think
it
probably
could
be
assumed
if
they
want
to
continue
in
business
that
they
would
have
to
replace
this
facility
although,
it
was
not
part
of
the
agreement
between
the
prospective
customer
and
the
detroit
edison
company.
mr.
richard
schreiber
yes
they
did
mr.
justice.
mr.
richard
schreiber
they
had
--
mr.
richard
schreiber
not
in
the
detroit
edison
case
mr.
justice,
but
we
feel
that
the
legal
obligation
and
the
practical
obligation
of
replacement
that
we
have
makes
our
case
more
persuasive
for
justifying
a
claim
for
depreciation
deductions
on
113
(a)
(8)
(b)
than
the
brown
shoe
case.
mr.
richard
schreiber
no,
because
of
the
overriding
considerations
that
the
payments
from
the
prospective
customers
in
detroit
edison.
mr.
richard
schreiber
right.
mr.
richard
schreiber
yes
that’s
true.
mr.
richard
schreiber
we
feel
that
the
teaching
of
the
brown
shoe
case
was
that
the
contributions
made
by
the
local
citizen
proves
to
the
brown
shoe
company
was
to
benefit
the
public
at
large.
mr.
richard
schreiber
in
other
words,
the
--
to
create
additional
job
opportunities
with
--
mr.
richard
schreiber
yes.
and
the
means
they
used
to
achieve
this
public
purpose
was
to
make
these
contributions
to
the
working
capital
of
the
taxpayer.
we
feel
that
that
is
strictly
analogous
to
the
factual
situation
we
have
here.
the
primary
purpose
of
the
federal-aid
highway
act
was
to
benefit
the
public
at
large
by
enlarging
the
network
of
highways
and
also
to
increase
safety
at
these
intersections
between
highways
and
railroads.
now
the
means
that
the
government
chose
to
use
to
reach
this
laudable
objective
was
to
make
these
contributions
to
this
taxpayer
in
order
to
benefit
the
public,
but
in
so
doing
did
so
by
contributing
to
our
working
capital.
in
fact,
i
might
enlarge
on
that
just
a
bit.
the
agreements
between
the
respondent
that
was
with
the
local
or
state
governmental
unit
provided
for
the
construction
of
these
railroad
bridges
and
these
rail
crossing
protective
devices
and
subsequent
to
that,
the
respondent
taxpayer
was
then
reimbursed
in
cash
through
the
federal-aid
highway
program.
so,
the
initial
expenditure
was
out
of
respondent’s
working
capital
to
fund
the
construction
of
these
projects
and
then
this
cash
that
went
to
the
construction
of
these
facilities
was
reimbursed
directly
into
respondent’s
working
capital.
mr.
richard
schreiber
well
--
mr.
richard
schreiber
the
industry
tracks
if
the
payment
is
made
initially
by
the
prospective
customer
without
any
right
of
reimbursement
that
money
would
never
appear
in
the
respondent’s
accounts
because
it
is
assumed
that
the
prospect
of
customers
paying
for
that
right
to
have
the
track
in
there
to
serve
his
business.
mr.
richard
schreiber
that
is
more
like
detroit
edison
than
the
instant
fact
situation,
yes
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
richard
schreiber
the
spur
track
situation?
it’s
different
because
there,
the
prospective
customer
is
making
payment
in
order
to
obtain
services
that
might
not
otherwise
be
available
to
him.
unless
there
is
a
legal
obligation
on
the
respondent
to
construct
the
facility,
it’s
within
its
his
discretion
as
to
whether
or
not
it
will
do
so
and
that
is
comparable
to
the
detroit
edison
case.
here,
mr.
chief
justice,
we
have
a
situation
where
this
respondent
railroad
had
a
preexisting
legal
obligation
to
construct
these
facilities
in
accordance
with
the
laws
of
the
states
in
which
we
operated.
the
state
regulatory
commissions
did
and
frequently
did
issue
orders
requiring
railroads
to
construct
these
types
of
facilities
on
their
property.
generally,
that
was
done
as
a
result
of
a
petition
from
residents
of
the
local
community
if
they
wanted
a
signal
light
or
a
crossing
gate
at
particular
location
in
their
town
and
they
would
go
down
to
the
state
public
service
commission
and
as
a
result
of
the
proceedings
there
we
were
frequently
ordered
as
the
record
below
indicates
to
construct
these
facilities.
so,
there
was
a
preexisting
legal
obligation
on
respond
it
to
construct
these
facilities,
which
distinguishes
it
from
the
situation
in
detroit
edison
case
and
from
the
situation
with
regard
to
the
spur
track.
mr.
richard
schreiber
the
title
would
be
dependent
on
whether
or
not
the
track
was
certainly
on
the
prospective
customer’s
property
or
whether
it
was
on
railroad
right
of
way.
if
it
was
on
railroad
right
of
way,
the
title
would
--
legal
title
would
assume
to
be
on
the
railroad.
but
if
it
was
on
as
most
of
the
siding
tracks
for
serving
customers'
plant
facilities
are
located
within
that
particular
plant
facility
area.
mr.
richard
schreiber
probably
the
lead
in
mr.
chief
justice,
would
be
in
order
to
get
in
to
the
property
line.
mr.
richard
schreiber
well,
the
prospective
company
would
only
be
paying
for
the
track
that’s
located
on
its
property,
in
other
words,
a
side
track
up
to
a
door
inside
of
its
building
in
order
to
serve
that
particular
company.
the
--
what
we
call
a
turnout
from
the
rail
track
off
the
railroad
right
of
way
to
the
property
line
of
plant
would
be
our
cost
and
of
course
the
--
mr.
richard
schreiber
maybe
in
regard
to
the
possible
reconstruction
of
the
bridges
and
crossing
signal
protection
devices?
well,
if
that
were
to
be
the
case
and
of
course
we
certainly
hope
that
won’t
be
the
case
in
connection
with
tax
payer
that
would
be
the
situation
that
would
have
to
be
determined
at
that
time.
but,
as
of
today
--
mr.
richard
schreiber
could
they
mr.
justice
i
don’t
have
the
answer
to
that
question
whether
they
could
or
not
if
like
congressional
act
--
mr.
richard
schreiber
from
the
standpoint
and
the
perspective
of
fairness,
it
might
very
well
be
fair
and
reasonable
if
at
some
future
date
due
to
a
collapse
of
a
particular
railroad
the
obligation
was
placed
back
on
the
government
to
replace
these
facilities
to
offset
the
depreciation
deductions
claimed.
however,
at
that
situation
--
mr.
richard
schreiber
pardon
me?
mr.
richard
schreiber
well,
it’s
gone
in
the
sense
that
it
was
available
to
the
tax
payer.
but
if
in
your
situation,
the
tax
payer
railroad
is
becoming
bankrupt,
it
wouldn’t
have
any
taxable
income
so
it
wouldn’t
be
able
to
achieve
any
benefit
from
the
deduction.
mr.
richard
schreiber
well,
as
long
as
its
still
viable
--
mr.
richard
schreiber
this,
the
federal-aid
highway
act
of
1933
and
the
subsequent
amendments
there
to
were
provided
for
the
primary
purpose
of
benefiting
the
public
by
enlarging
a
highway
network
and
also
to
provide
these
safety
facilities
that
--
mr.
richard
schreiber
the
taxpayer
claiming
his
legitimate
right
to
depreciation
deductions
is
exercising
the
rights
as
provided
by
statute.
mr.
richard
schreiber
but
the
project
itself
has
the
primary
purpose
to
benefit
the
public
although
that
is
true.
as
i’ve
indicated
before
the
question
is
the
means
that
were
utilized
to
achieve
this
primary
purpose.
mr.
richard
schreiber
in
regards
to
the
track
itself.
the
track
is
a
non
depreciable
item
from
the
standpoint
of
straight
line
depreciation.
so,
therefore,
the
depreciation
on
the
tracks
is
not
an
issue
here,
it's
only
those
items
that
we
claim
are
entitled
to
straight
line.
mr.
richard
schreiber
under
straight-line
depreciation.
they
are
under
retirement
accountings,
mr.
justice.
now,
we
submit
that
the
issue
here
involves
clearly
and
simply
a
question
of
the
proper
statutory
construction
of
section
113
of
the
1939
internal
revenue
code.
now
the
section,
we
are
relying
upon
is
section
113
(a)
(8)
(b),
which
provides
for
the
transferee
to
assume
the
basis
of
the
transferor
on
payments
made
by
shareholders
as
paid
in
surplus
or
from
any
other
person
as
spelled
out
in
the
regulation
and
in
the
statute
itself.
now,
this
distinguishes
the
situation
furthermore,
from
the
detroit
edison
case
because
under
section
113
(a)
(8)
(b),
there
is
no
necessity
for
a
requirement
of
donative
intent
as
there
would
be
under
section
113
(a)
(2),
which
is
the
gift
provision
and
permits
the
donee
to
acquire
of
a
donor’s
basis.
the
donative
intent
only
is
of
significance
in
connection
with
an
interpretation
of
113
(a)
(2).
now
as
i
have
indicated
previously,
we
feel
that
this
case
is
controlled
by
this
court’s
1950
decision
in
the
brown
shoe
case.
now,
the
logic
and
the
rationale
of
this
court’s
decision
in
the
brown
shoe
case
is
equally
applicable
in
connection
with
our
case.
the
facts
are
parallel.
the
primary
intent
was
to
benefit
the
public
at
large,
both
in
brown
shoe
and
in
this
case.
secondly,
the
payments
in
the
brown
shoe
case
and
in
this
case
were
not
payments
for
goods
or
services
to
be
rendered
as
they
were
in
the
detroit
edison
case.
mr.
richard
schreiber
that’s
correct
mr.
chief
justice
that
the
–
mr.
richard
schreiber
that’s
not
the
same
factual
situation
here
because
we
had
this
preexisting
legal
obligation
to
construct
these
facilities,
yes
sir?
mr.
richard
schreiber
that’s
why
we
feel
mr.
chief
justice
that
the
facts
in
this
case
are
more
persuasive
to
justify
a
claim
under
section
113
(a)
(8)
(b).
brown
shoe
company
agreed
to
maintain
this
new
facility
or
the
renovated
facility
within
that
community
only
for
an
initial
period
of
10
years.
now
at
the
expiration
of
that
ten-year
period,
the
brown
shoe
company
could
pick
up
and
move
on
and
conceivably
they
did.
here,
we
had
the
obligation
of
replacement
on
a
continuing
basis
if
we
intended
to
continue
an
operation
as
an
interstate
railroad.
that
as
i
was
indicating
is
the
distinguishing
characteristics
we
feel
between
detroit
edison
on
the
one
hand
and
brown
shoe
and
on
the
factual
situation
in
this
case
on
the
other
hand.
now,
as
mentioned
briefly
in
partitioner's
argument,
as
part
of
the
over-all
revision
of
the
1954
internal
revenue
code,
section
362
(c)
was
added
to
apply
a
zero
basis
to
these
types
of
contributions,
but
to
do
so
on
a
prospective
fashion
only
as
to
those
facilities
constructed
subsequent
to
june
22,
1954
and
facilities
that
we’re
talking
about
here
today,
these
rail
bridges,
these
rail
crossing
safety
devices
were
all
constructed
prior
to
the
cut
off
date
provided
for
in
section
362
(c)
of
the
1954
code.
it
is
clear
also,
from
the
legislative
history
of
section
362
(c),
that
it
was
intended
to
overcome
the
effect
of
the
brown
shoe
case,
but
to
do
so
on
a
prospective
fashion
only.
congress
had
it
within
its
discretion
to
apply
this
revision
on
the
code
provided
for
in
section
362
(c)
both
in
a
retroactive
manner
if
it
deemed
prudent
and
advisable
or
in
a
prospective
manner.
they
chose
to
do
it
on
a
prospective
fashion
only.
now,
the
commissioner
and
the
government
are
coming
in
to
court
here
and
saying
that
regardless
of
what
the
congressional
intent
was
this
54
code
revision
should
now
be
applied
retroactively
to
factual
situations
that
the
congress
specifically
excluded
when
it
amended
the
code.
now,
i
think
it’s
clear
that
as
a
general
principle
of
law,
no
retroactive
effect
is
to
be
given
to
a
statutory
amendment
unless
it
is
explicitly
required
by
the
terms
and
conditions
of
that
statutory
amendment.
here,
the
case
is
quite
to
the
contrary
that
it
was
to
operate
prospectively
only.
therefore,
we
assert
that
our
rights
to
these
depreciation
deductions
have
matured
exclusively
under
section
113
of
the
1939
code
and
specifically
section
(a)
(8)
(b).
finally,
i
just
like
to
touch
briefly
on
the
so-called
terms
letter
defense
petitioner
which
we
have
been
faced
with
throughout
the
trial
of
the
case
in
the
court
of
claims
and
on
appeal
to
the
court
below.
petitioner
asserts
that
certain
illustrative
language
out
of
the
so-called
memo
58
guidelines
is
a
bar
to
our
claim
for
depreciation
deductions
in
this
case.
briefly,
what
transpired
here
is
that
in
1944,
pursuant
to
a
request
by
the
taxpayer
for
a
change
over
in
method
of
depreciation
accounting
from
--
retirement
accounting
to
straight-line
depreciation
accounting
revised
or
schedules
were
submitted
to
the
internal
revenue
service
and
an
offer
of
a
terms
letter
agreement,
a
consent
of
this
change
over
in
accounting
was
sent
to
the
taxpayer.
included
in
that
terms
letter
in
1945
was
the
document
that
has
been
referred
to
as
memo
58
guidelines.
it's
our
position,
number
one,
that
the
memo
58
guidelines
were
never
a
part
of
the
terms
letter
agreement
between
respondent
and
the
commissioner.
they
were
not
incorporated
either
by
reference
or
otherwise
into
the
terms
letter
offer
between
respondent
and
commissioner.
then,
upon
receipt
of
the
terms
letter
offer
from
the
commissioner,
respondent
replied
with
a
qualified
acceptance
indicating
that
in
the
event
that
any
of
the
terms
and
conditions
should
be
changed
by
statutory
amendment,
by
operation
of
law
or
otherwise,
that
the
taxpayer
would
not
be
precluded
from
the
benefits
of
such
changes.
now,
considering
the
status
of
the
law
in
regard
to
these
depreciation
deductions
in
1945,
it’s
clear
why
these
were
not
included
in
the
schedule
submitted
by
respondent
to
the
commissioner
of
internal
revenue.
in
1943,
this
court
decided
the
detroit
edison
case
and
subsequent
to
that
decision,
the
commissioner
began
to
disallow
depreciation
deductions
to
the
brown
shoe
company
based
on
the
detroit
edison
case.
that’s
what
initiated
the
lawsuit
by
the
brown
shoe
company
to
be
allowed
to
claim
these
depreciation
deductions
and
that
issue
was
resolved
by
this
court
in
1950.
so,
from
the
period
from
1943
to
1950,
it
was
the
position
of
the
commissioner
and
the
government
that
nobody
was
entitled
to
any
depreciation
deductions
on
contributions
to
capital
similar
to
those
at
issue
in
brown
shoe
and
here.
therefore,
it
would
have
been
a
meaningless
act
for
us
to,
as
a
result
of
a
request
for
change
over
in
accounting
raise
the
issue
when
that
was
the
current
understanding
of
the
commissioner
and
the
government.
the
terms
letter
itself
and
the
memo
58
both
specifically
were
qualified
to
indicate
that
depreciation
was
to
be
in
accordance
with
section
113
of
the
1939
internal
revenue
code
and
the
regulations
issued
there
under.
therefore,
once
it
became
clear
as
a
result
of
this
court’s
decision
on
the
brown
shoe
case
that
contributions
of
this
nature
were
properly
depreciable.
it
affected
a
change
in
the
terms
and
conditions
of
the
terms
letter
agreement
between
respondent
and
commissioner
and
justified
our
claim
for
depreciation
deductions
even
if
the
memo
58
guidelines
could
be
considered
as
even
partially
incorporated
into
the
terms
letter
offer
from
the
commissioner
to
respondent.
finally,
in
conclusion,
respondent
would
like
to
assert
that
it's
a
very
simple
factual
situation
we
are
dealing
with
here
in
this
case.
what
we’re
talking
about
are
railroad
bridges,
rail
safety
facilities
that
are
directly
related
to
the
operation
of
plaintiff’s
railroad
that
we
have
the
legal
and
practical
obligation
of
replacement
of
these
facilities
if
as
we
do
continue
to
desire
to
stay
in
business
as
an
interstate
railroad.
further,
that
the
government
should
not
be
allowed
as
result
of
this
litigation
to
apply
a
statutory
amendment
in
a
retroactive
fashion
when
congress
of
although
it
had
it
within
its
discretion
to
do
so
failed
to
do
so.
and
finally,
we
assert
that
the
so-called
terms
letter
defense
cannot
be
successfully
used
to
defeat
a
valid
claim
of
this
taxpayer
on
a
substantive
issue
of
its
entitlement
to
depreciation
deductions
when
the
illustrative
language
relied
upon
by
petitioner
is
included
in
a
memo
58
guideline
enclosure
to
the
terms
letter
agreement,
which
is
qualified
by
providing
that
all
applicable
sections
of
the
39
code
will
govern
the
situation
in
regard
to
depreciation.
and
when
respondent’s
acceptance
of
the
terms
letter
agreement
was
so
qualified
to
preserve
its
legal
rights
to
contest
the
legitimacy
of
these
depreciation
deductions
in
a
proper
form
by
a
timely
claim
for
refund,
which
is
precisely
what
the
respondent
did
successfully
both
in
the
trial
court
and
before
the
court
of
claims
on
review.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
