chief

warren
e.
burger
mr.
schreiber,
i’m
not
sure
it
is
important
or
even
relevant
but
in
recent
times
at
least
spur
tracks
off
the
railroad
yard
running
into
an
industry
to
pick
up
their
freight
have
been
constructed
at
the
cost
by
the
railroad,
that
the
cost
of
the
industry.
what
do
the
railroads
do
about
that,
do
they
claim
depreciation
on
those
spur
tracks?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
industry
tracks?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
isn’t
that
quite
a
bit
like
detroit
edison?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
how
do
you
--
how
would
distinguish
it?
tell
me
how,
you
think
that’s
distinguishable
in
what
respect
from
your
case?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
some
part
of
it
is
always
on
the
right
of
way
of
the
railroad,
is
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
the
railroads
don’t
claim
any
depreciation
for
that
part?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
there
one
difference
that
in
brown
shoe,
perhaps
the
industry
would
not
have
come
into
the
area
at
all
except
the
contribution?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
not
true
here?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
so
you
didn’t
have
any
option
about
it
that
brown
shoe
had?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
schreiber.
thank
you
mr.
stone.
the
case
is
submitted.
