mr.
harold
gondelman
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
listening
to
the
government’s
argument
today
reminds
me
very
much
of
the
lyrics
of
the
mikado,
where
mr.
gilbert
said
the
flowers
that
bloom
in
the
spring
tra
la,
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
case.
and
the
government’s
argument
has
nothing
to
do
with
this
case.
he
did
not
tell
you
mr.
justice
powell,
that
the
first
attorney
in
the
history
of
the
united
states
since
march
3,
1899
who
has
fought
a
case
under
that
act
through
to
a
jury
verdict
is
me.
that’s
the
first
and
only
case
that
has
come
before
this
court
on
a
trial
in
a
courtroom,
and
your
honors
have
specifically
reserved
that,
and
that
is
why
i
did
not
go
through
motions
and
have
the
case
come
up
here
in
the
vacuum
that
it
did
in
republic
steel
and
standard
oil.
you
have
to
have
the
facts
of
the
case,
and
in
fact
in
the
opinion
of
this
court
in
standard
oil,
the
last
paragraph
says,
we
pass
only
on
the
quality
of
the
pollutant
not
on
the
quantity
of
proof
necessary
to
support
a
conviction
nor
on
the
question
as
to
what
scienter
requirement
the
act
imposes
as
those
questions
are
not
before
the
court
on
that
restricted
appeal.
interestingly
enough
in
the
footnote,
since
having
dealt
with
the
construction
placed
by
the
court
below
on
the
sherman
act,
our
jurisdiction
on
this
appeal
is
exhausted.
we
are
not
at
liberty
to
consider
other
objections
to
the
indictment
or
objections
which
may
arise
upon
the
trial
with
respect
to
the
merits
of
the
charge.
i
don’t
know
what
they
mean
the
criminal
charge
or
the
charge
of
the
court.
i
did
attack
both
of
those
before
the
court
below.
now,
being
trial
counsel
in
the
case
perhaps
gives
me
a
little
advantage.
i’m
a
bit
appalled
when
the
government
tells
this
court
that
there
was
no
offer
in
the
court
below
to
prove
that
the
discharges
of
which
we
stand
convicted
comply
with
the
water
quality
standards
of
the
government
of
the
united
states
say
“you
have
this
anomalous
situation.”
picco
has
been
fined
$10,000.00
for
violating
a
criminal
statute
which
the
government
of
the
united
states
says
is
not
a
pollution
discharge
under
its
own
water
quality.
now,
i
would
refer
you
to
page
158
of
the
appendix
that
the
government
printed.
despite
the
efforts
of
the
court
below
to
keep
me
from
making
a
record
that
this
court
would
have,
i
insisted
that
certain
offers
be
made.
one
of
them
is,
i
also
want
to
be
on
record.
i
want
to
be
on
the
record
the
fact
that
in
connection
with
mr.
--
mr.
harold
gondelman
158
sir,
at
the
top.
mr.
lucani
incidentally
is
a
water
quality
control
expert
who
at
one
time
while
the
canoes
were
running
up
and
down
the
monongahela
river,
one
of
his
employees
filled
the
bottle
and
gave
it
to
one
of
the
bounty
hunters
in
the
canoe
so
that
he
would
have
it
to
take
back.
mr.
lucani’s
testimony,
he
would
have
testified
if
permitted
that
the
discharges
august
7th,
august
19th
that’s
the
discharges,
and
the
specific
analysis
on
every
matter
which
is
related
to
this
and
these
information
are
absolutely
within
the
prescribed
limits
of
the
pennsylvania
water
quality
standards.
this
case
was
tried
in
june
1972
and
i
intended
to
prove
as
late
as
june
1972
that
every
item
on
the
exhibits
that
the
government
have
the
chemical
analyses
and
attached
to
their
brief,
every
item
is
below
the
standards
that
the
pennsylvania
sanitary
water
board
in
charge
of
this
permits
under
our
state
permit,
permits
picco
to
discharge
in
the
monongahela
river.
and
the
court
said
yes
but
i’ve
overruled
that
and
to
make
sure
that
the
record
was
clear
i
said
“but
it
is
not
on
the
record”
and
i
wanted
to
be
that
every
matter
discharged
by
this
defendant,
picco,
is
within
the
prescribed
regulations
of
the
commonwealth
of
pennsylvania
which
have
been
adopted
by
the
government
of
the
united
states,
and
therefore
insofar
as
this
actually
relates
to
our
dumping,
the
case
is
referred
to
pollutants
and
refuse
interchangeably
and
as
to
the
government’s
own
regulations,
what
we
were
convicted
of
discharging
as
a
pollutant
is
not
a
pollutant.
and
we’ve
cited
in
our
brief
and
i
need
not
go
in
to
that,
but
the
government
has
adopted
specifically
the
pennsylvania
standards.
congress
has
specifically
said
that
the
primacy
of
enforcing
water
pollution
controls
is
in
the
states.
mr.
harold
gondelman
the
existence
of
the
offense.
i
tried
very
hard,
believe
me,
to
get
the
court
to
harmonize
the
water
quality
acts
which
were
passed
in
1965,
1970
and
the
refuse
act.
they
can
be
read
harmoniously
together
without
putting
the
government
of
the
united
states
into
the
box
that
it
has
painted
itself
by
actually
being
the
one
who
muddies
the
waters
of
this
whole
situation
more
than
anyone
else.
mr.
harold
gondelman
well,
of
course
i
find
that
argument
very
difficult
to
believe,
because
the
government
has
appealed
from
the
circuit’s
finding
number
one,
that
congress
intended
no
crime
under
the
facts
of
this
case,
and
two,
if
congress
did
intend
such
a
crime,
such
a
crime
would
violate
due
process.
i
don’t
know
how
this
court
considered
the
government’s
appeal
without
getting
into
the
merits
of
the
case
and
whether
or
not
a
crime
actually
was
committed.
and
on
the
issue
of
whether
a
crime
has
been
committed,
justice
rehnquist,
the
issue
seems
to
me
to
be
what
is
refuse
and
in
technology
and
mr.
lucani’s
testimony,
he
was
completely
almost
as
frustrated
as
i
because
he
could
not
talk
about
pollutant
and
refuse,
or
define
those
terms
because
he
said
“i
must
know
what
the
receptacle
is
into
which
the
effluent
is
being
discharged.”
you
see,
they
go
out
to
the
middle
of
the
monongahela
river
and
find
a
little
bit
of
iron
and
a
little
bit
of
sulfur
and
other
solids,
where
if
you
came
closer
to
the
river
and
the
millions
of
gallons,
and
i
think
even
their
test
expert
testified
billions
of
gallons
of
water.
in
water
pollution
science,
you
must
know
what
the
effluent
is
going
into
in
a
rate
of
water
flow
not
dissolve
and
evaporate
the
water
to
get
the
solids
out
and
make
these
exhibits
sound
like
these
were
actually
solids.
all
of
the
discharges
in
picco’s
plant
were
in
a
liquid
state,
not
solid.
and
the
fact
is
that
what
i
tried
to
do
is
say
to
the
court,
the
word
pollutant
has
a
scientific
present
technology
definition.
how
can
you
charge
a
jury
that
we
have
no
permit
to
discharge
refuse,
if
in
the
science
and
technology
today
it
is
not
refuse
as
that
term
is
defined
by
the
very
science
trying
to
work
to
clean
up
the
stream.
mr.
lucani
would’ve
testified
and
i
cited
on
the
brief
the
fact
that
pennsylvania
and
the
federal
government
defined
pollutants
as
things
above
a
certain
standard,
above
a
certain
discharge
rate,
and
mr.
lucani
continuously
said
“i
cannot
tell
you
if
this
is
refuse
since,
your
honor,
you
have
told
me
i
can’t
talk
about
what
it
goes
into
and
the
rate
of
the
flow
of
the
stream,
in
other
words,
you
can’t
let
me
testify
as
an
expert
which
i
am
trying
to
do.”
mr.
harold
gondelman
it
doesn’t
hinge
on
that
but
it
hinges
on
this
your
honor,
the
question
asked
was
if
there
was
no
permit
program,
is
there
a
crime
a
committed?
i
must
first
say
that
such
a
finding
with
i
think
about
the
court’s
approach
to
this
case,
the
lower
courts
understanding
of
this
case
in
light
of
republic
steel
and
standard
oil
was
that
it’s
like
when
he
was
in
bolivia
they
told
him
that
he
couldn’t
carry
a
cigarette
lighter
without
a
permit.
he
went
down
to
get
the
cigarette
lighter,
they
say
“we
don’t
have
permits”
they
confiscated
the
cigarette
lighter,
and
this
is
the
way
this
whole
case
was
tried.
the
court
continually
said
to
me
that
whether
we
--
mr.
harold
gondelman
i
don’t
have
to
reach
another
ground
your
honor,
what
i’m
saying
is
that
under
these
circumstances,
the
court
of
appeals
has
said
that
without
a
permit
program
and
that
i
should
be
entitled
to
prove
whether
or
not
there
was
a
permit
program
in
effect,
because
after
all
the
regulations
and
the
statute
itself.
unfortunately,
the
government
doesn’t
quote
these
things
completely
to
the
court,
if
they
read
the
complete
provided
further
however
quote
of
the
act
of
1899,
incidentally
it’s
interesting
that
up
until
1969,
this
was
the
rivers
and
harbors
act
of
1899.
congress
has
not
amended
that
act.
the
government
has
amended
it
by
continually
referring
to
it
as
the
refuse
act.
it
becomes
the
refuse
act
on
december
23,
1970
in
the
presidential
proclamation
when
he
referred
to
the
refuse
act
of
1899,
but
the
act
itself
section
13
says
“and
provided
further
that
the
secretary
of
the
army,
whenever
in
the
judgment
of
the
chief
of
engineers
anchorage
and
navigation
will
not
be
injured
thereby.”
the
government
hasn’t
read
the
next
clause
to
you
comma
“may
permit
that
deposit
of
any
material
above
mentioned
in
navigable
waters,
within
limits
to
be
defined
and
under
conditions
to
be
prescribed
by
him,”
then
it
says
“provided
applications
made
to
him
prior
to
the
deposit
of
such
material.”
now,
the
courts
had
been,
the
lower
courts
especially
have
been
very
concerned
about
whether
the
phrase
comes
after
the
semicolon
or
before
the
semicolon,
i
don’t
know
how
anyone
would
diagram
this
sentence
at
all.
it
would
be
an
impossibility
but
it
certainly
seems
to
me
that
as
the
phrases
flow
the
secretary
may
permit
the
deposit
of
materials
within
limits
to
be
defined
and
under
conditions
prescribed
by
him.
and
what
we
find
actually
is
that
in
413
of
the
act
that
is
33
u.s.c.
413.
“the
department
of
justice
shall
conduct
the
legal
proceedings
under
section
407
and
it
shall
be
the
duty
of
united
states
attorneys
to
vigorously
prosecute
all
offenders
against
the
same.”
this
was
passed
on
march
3,
1899
with
the
act
we’re
concerned
about.
i
happened
to
check,
i
find
that
there’re
28
attorneys
general
to
the
united
states,
five
of
whom
have
graced
this
honorable
court,
and
yet
we
find
that
no
vigorous
prosecution
except
for
the
act
of
1899
affecting
navigation.
next
we
find,
section
419,
this
was
a
new
statute
passed
in
1905
in
which
congress
said
“the
secretary
of
the
army
is
authorized
and
empowered
to
prescribe
regulations
to
govern
the
transportation
and
dumping
into
any
navigable
waters,
or
waters
adjacent
there
to
have
dredging
the
earth’s
garbage
and
other
refuse
materials
of
every
kind
and
description.”
the
exact
language
in
the
act
of
section
407,
the
secretary
must
prescribe
regulations
concerning
the
dumping
among
other
things
other
refuse
materials
of
every
kind
or
description
whenever
in
his
judgment
navigation
will
not
be
affected
thereby.
so
i
say
that
the
secretary
of
the
army,
if
this
was
a
pollution
statute
and
if
we
require
the
permit,
he
had
a
duty
to
set
forth
in
regulations
what
the
permit
would
be.
i
offered
these
exhibits
in
evidence
and
they’re
part
of
my
brief.
i
think
they’re
exhibit
7,
8
and
9.
in
1939
and
this
comes
to
the
court
of
appeals
argument,
justice
white,
that
the
administrative
rulings
and
interpretations
caused
picco
not
to
apply
for
a
permit
any
more
than
ask
if
anything
else
were
required.
in
1939,
the
information
circular
says
“applications
for
authority
to
execute
work
or
erect
structures
into
navigable
waters
of
the
united
states”
nothing
about
pollution
in
this
circular.
this
was
secured
by
subpoena
to
the
corps
of
engineers
to
bring
with
them
all
of
the
regulations
they
had
ever
published
under
section
407,
this
they
brought.
mr.
harold
gondelman
this
was
1939,
mr.
justice
stewart.
now,
then
brought
to
me,
since
we
hear
that
the
regulation
was
somehow
changed
in
1968
after
some
of
the
decisions
of
this
court
which
went
beyond
the
factual
situations
in
those
cases.
they
then
show
how
well
they
amended
it
in
1968,
permits
for
work
in
navigable
waters.
this
is
the
administrative
ruling
and
publication
which
was
given
to
everyone.
then
we
find,
now
we
say
that
this
is
after
the
presidential
proclamation
which
incidentally
had
a
moratorium
in
the
date
you
asked
about,
justice
blackmun,
was
very
important.
these
informations
are
filed
in
april
1971.
in
december,
the
president
issued
an
order
to
implement
a
permit
program
and
you
had
until
july
1st
to
apply
for
a
permit,
so
that
under
the
president’s
own
proclamation
of
december
23,
there
was
an
attempted
moratorium
to
get
people
to
now
understand
what
had
never
been
the
law
of
this
country
that
you
needed
a
permit,
because
in
1971,
the
same
regulation
now
says
permits
for
work
and
structures
in
and
for
discharge
or
deposits
into
navigable
water.
and
now
we
get
to
the
need
for
a
permit
and
it’s
not
a
letter
like
judge
teitelbaum
kept
telling
me,
but
the
permits
are
5,
6
and
7
pages
and
require
thousands
and
thousands
of
dollars
to
determine
the
quantity
of
the
effluent,
the
vast
technological
data
that
is
needed
in
order
to
apply
for
a
permit.
mr.
harold
gondelman
they’re
only
in
the
record
in
this
way
justice
black
--
powell
that
i
offered
them,
they
were
put
in
this
envelope
and
i
have
added
them
to
my
brief,
and
therefore,
you
will
find
simply
the
cover
as
an
appendix
to
my
brief.
i
did
not
duplicate
it
because
i
was
afraid
the
brief
would
simply
get
out
of
hand.
but
you
find
that
exhibit
9
as
the
1971
regulation,
exhibit
8
the
1968
regulation.
i
have
duplicated
a
few
sections
which
show
that
--
actually
the
regulation
says
since
republic
steel,
the
secretary
of
the
army
must
now
with
the
corps
of
engineers
find
out
how
they
get
industry
to
pay
for
dredging
the
calumet
river
in
effect,
because
the
solids
were
building
up.
mr.
harold
gondelman
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
harold
gondelman
only,
your
honor,
if
the
theory
as
i
have
it
is
that
the
finder
of
fact,
that
we’re
going
to
a
jury.
under
the
court’s
theory
of
this
case,
there
was
really
no
point
in
trying
and
i
think
you
plead
guilty
because
you
have
no
defense.
you
don’t
have
a
permit
he
says
this
thru
“the
only
way
you
can
avoid
liability
and
criminal
culpability
is
show
me
if
you
have
a
permit,
or
that
you
didn’t
know
that
you
were
putting
this
stuff
in
the
river.”
now,
the
fact
is
we
knew
we
were
putting
it
in
the
river
and
we
knew
that
we
didn’t
have
a
permit,
but
i
was
offering
in
evidence
at
the
trial
a
number
of
things.
we’re
talking
now
about
scienter,
i
thought
i
would
get
a
charge
on
mens
rea
because
it’s
reserved.
this
honorable
court
hasn’t
decided
whether
it’s
malum
prohibitum,
if
it
is
of
course
then
all
industry
should’ve
been
closed
and
for
70
years
in
this
country.
but
if
there
is
any
scienter
required
i
felt
that
the
actual
publications
of
the
government
of
the
united
states
telling
us
whether
we
needed
a
permit
would
be
necessary
to
prove
in
the
court.
not
only
that
--
mr.
harold
gondelman
okay,
thank
you.[lunch
recess]
mr.
harold
gondelman
or
really,
whether
the
case
has
a
criminal
violation
inherent
in
it
at
all,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
the
point
--
mr.
harold
gondelman
i
did
not
cross-petition,
however,
the
--
mr.
harold
gondelman
i’ll
cover
it
in
less
time
than
that.
we
have
to
look
at
the
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals
to
see
what
this
court
granted
certiorari
from,
and
the
court
of
appeals
specifically
held
that
the
due
process
violations,
in
answer
to
mr.
justice
rehnquist’s
questions,
how
did
i
offer
this?
the
fact
that
i
offered
this
in
the
trial
is
what
this
court
of
appeals
and
that
is
what
is
now
before
this
court,
i
may
respectfully
suggest,
because
the
court
of
appeals
held
two
things.
one,
congress
never
intended
a
crime
under
the
facts
of
this
case.
from
that
the
government
has
appealed
and
that
is
what
is
before
this
court,
so
the
court
must
now
decide
whether
a
crime
has
been
committed.
mr.
harold
gondelman
because
they
held
that
at
least
offers
of
proof
should
have
been
affirmatively
allowed.
mr.
harold
gondelman
that
is
correct.
and
if
the
evidence,
the
effect
of
the
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
if
i
can
prove
the
exhibits
which
i
shown
this
court
namely
that
there
was
no
permit
program,
that
the
corps
of
engineers
did
not
believe
that
a
permit
program
affecting
pollution
rather
than
navigation
was
necessary,
that
there
was
no
crime
committed
under
facts
of
this
case.
and
i
think
that
by
reversing,
they
simply
say
“put
that
evidence
before
a
court”
and
i’m
entitled
to
a
directive
verdict.
mr.
harold
gondelman
that
would
be
before
the
district
court
unless
this
court
were
to
find
as
the
court
of
appeals
found
that
if
there
was
no
permit
program
which
is
throughout
everybody
but
the
department
of
justice
agrees
that
there
was
no
permit
program.
and
it
is
definitely
before
this
court
because
the
second
holding
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
that
the
circumstances
here
demonstrate
that
no
crime
was
committed.
and
in
that
connection,
they
discussed
the
regulations
of
the
corps
of
engineers.
they
discussed
the
lack
of
any
affirmative
permit
program.
they
discussed
the
fact
that
we
were
affirmatively
told
that
they
was
no
permit
program
required
until
1970,
and
then
in
the
third
part
of
the
opinion
it
says
“even
if
the
act
of
1899
were
construed
to
make
picco’s
activities
criminal,
due
process
considerations
would
require
a
reversal”
and
in
that
situation
he
says
that
picco
acclaims
that
it
was
misled
by
interpretation
given
to
the
statute
by
the
corps
of
engineers,
and
this
is
where
we
get
to
the
offers
of
evidence,
none
of
which
was
admitted
in
the
court
below,
but
which
are
attached
to
the
brief
for
the
consideration
of
this
court.
so
i
do
believe
that
the
government’s
petition
for
cert
and
this
court
having
granted
cert
directly
places
before
this
court.
was
a
crime
committed
at
all
if
the
authors
in
the
court
below
had
been
allowed?
now,
i
think
we
briefly
ought
to
get
to
the
effect
of
what
the
government
is
saying
here.
since
taylor
versus
reeser
(ph),
the
government
has
been
enjoined
from
issuing
permits.
now,
if
we
understand
the
government’s
argument
today,
then
under
the
administrative
absolutism
that
the
department
of
justice
as
it
has,
every
industry
in
this
country
since
the
injunction
has
been
issued
where
no
permits
are
now
available
by
a
court
injunction,
every
industry
that
has
been
discharging
without
a
permit
is
guilty
of
a
crime
obviously.
it
has
to
be
the
logical
conclusion
of
the
government’s
argument
before
this
court
today.
we
know
that
you
cannot
get
a
permit
today
because
of
that
decision,
it’s
on
appeal
but
at
least
for
a
year,
a
year
and
a
half
now
nobody
could
get
a
permit.
and
yet
a
u.s.
attorney
certainly
could
prosecute
any
industry
discharging
into
a
navigable
stream
matters
which
did
not
affect
navigation
because
they
don’t
have
a
permit,
because
after
all,
what
difference
does
it
make?
they
don’t
have
a
permit
only
because
the
court
has
enjoined
the
government
permission
legally?
and
if
they
have
not
committed
--
if
industry
has
not
committed
a
crime
during
the
pendency
of
that
injunction,
then
why
doesn’t
it
logically
follow
that
before
the
injunction
if
there
was
no
permit
program,
there
also
was
no
crime
committed.
mr.
rockel
says,
the
director
of
the
epa
says
that
there’s
no
question
that
no
one
could
get
a
permit
under
the
act
of
1899,
i
have
his
citation
in
my
brief,
so
that
without
a
permit
program
because
of
court
injunction
or
prior
to
that,
certainly
there
is
no
crime
committed
here
and
that
issue
has
been
decided
by
the
court
of
appeals.
the
court
below
took
the
position
completely
that
it
does
not
make
any
difference
whether
we
could
get
a
permit.
the
only
way
that
we
could
not
violate
the
law
is
not
to
discharge
effluent
into
a
river.
i
suggest
that
if
acquisition
had
been
taken
by
united
states
attorney
in
1944
when
industry
was
going
full
blast
to
supply
the
war
material
for
the
boys
in
omaha
beach
in
world
war
ii,
and
the
effect
of
that
type
of
criminal
prosecution
would
have
been
to
advice
industry
to
close
its
doors,
the
u.s.
attorney
would’ve
been
subject
to
uncertain
great
criticism
if
not
internment
for
having
taking
an
american
activities
approaches
to
the
law.
the
fact
that
they
didn’t
in
1943,
1944
in
fact
the
fact
that
the
secretary
of
army
awarded
--
awards
to
industry
during
those
periods
are
national
crisis
certainly
would
indicate
that
there
is
no
criminal
violation
and
they
compounded
in
this
case.
the
court
below
charged
the
jury
that
if
the
secretary
of
the
army
in
his
discretion
decided
not
to
issue
permits,
despite
the
fact
that
my
entire
offer
was
to
show
that
the
secretary
of
the
army
had
actually
exercised
this
discretion
saying
that
no
permits
were
required.
in
fact
in
the
1968
regulations
when
they
talk
about
the
republic
steel
case,
the
only
change
the
core
of
engineers
saw
was
that
under
republic
steel,
they
were
now
obligated
to
assess
who
should
pay
dredging.
i
think
what
has
happened
in
this
situation
and
the
metamorphosis
so
called,
they
change
from
the
rivers
and
harbors
act
to
a
refuse
act
unfortunately
comes
abide
in
this
way.
republic
steel
came
before
this
court
on
a
petition
by
the
government
of
the
united
states
and
if
you
read
their
briefs,
you
will
find
that
they
affirmatively
told
this
court
that
they
are
not
in
a
pollution
case,
they
are
in
a
navigation
case.
the
entire
brief
on
both
sides
talk
about
navigation,
the
opinion
of
this
court
says
we
have
pollution
statute
but
that
is
over
to
think
those
were
the
facts
that
were
before
this
court.
then
you
--
from
there,
we
are
led
to
standard
oil,
an
accidental
discharge
in
which
the
court
defined
good
gasoline
aviation
fuel
as
a
pollutant.
from
those
two
cases
we
have
now
jumped
the
complete
line
to
say
that
we
now
have
in
the
united
states
and
as
i
said,
now
they
talk
about
a
refuse
act,
but
i
think
that
when
you
see
the
presidential
regulations
proclamation
of
december
23,
1970,
you
must
ask
yourself
why
did
the
president
of
the
united
states
take
time
from
a
busy
schedule
to
issue
a
proclamation
implementing
a
permit
program
and
talking
about
all
of
the
laws
dealing
with
water
control
in
the
implementation
of
that
program.
he
did
it
because
there
was
no
such
program.
the
water
pollution
control
act
of
‘65,
‘70,
‘72
can
be
harmoniously
read
with
the
act
of
1899
if
one
defines
pollution
in
terms
of
those
acts.
this
case
has
no
impact
whatsoever
on
future
cases
because
of
the
act
of
1972,
the
government
admits
that.
this
case
and
the
thing
that
it
must
be
understood
here
is
that
this
case
is
not
a
pollution
case.
it
has
been
brought
here
without
attractiveness
on
the
times
of
today,
but
the
fact
is
that
it
is
not
a
pollution
case
because
if
we
are
complying
with
state
and
federal
standards
concerning
what
went
into
the
river,
we
could
put
the
same
thing
into
the
monongahela
river
today
and
i
offer
to
prove
that
that
we
did
in
1970
because
they
are
within
the
standards
of
the
government
of
the
united
states.
the
reply
brief
of
the
government
again
misrepresents
what
i
offered
to
prove.
it
said
that
i
offered
to
prove
that
we
would
comply
with
the
1974
standards
that
is
not
the
offer
of
proof.
commonwealth
of
pennsylvania
passed
clean
streams
legislation
before
the
federal
government
found
out
that
there
was
a
problem.
our
act
was
passed
in
1937
the
federal
act
1948.
i
offer
to
prove
that
under
the
present
pennsylvania
standards
which
are
among
the
highest
in
the
country,
they
intelligently
to
deal
with
the
economy
and
the
ecology
and
the
technology
that
is
available
said
by
december
31,
1974
these
will
be
the
new
standards
that
will
be
applicable
to
effluent
discharges
in
streams
of
this
commonwealth.
i
offer
to
prove
that
picco
is
already
in
the
process
and
was
when
the
canoes
floated
up
and
down
the
river
ready
in
the
process
of
building
a
$300,000.00
additional
water
treatment
plant
to
meet
the
new
standards
which
were
effective
and
will
be
effective
december
31,
1974.
you
do
not
have
as
the
government
untruthfully
tells
this
court
in
its
reply
brief,
the
largest
polluter
in
the
monongahela
river.
you
have
a
company
that
has
accepted
its
responsibilities,
understands
its
responsibilities
and
the
only
thing
the
government
has
done
in
this
prosecution
has
attempted
to
turn
off
an
industry
that
recognizes
that
it
is
trying
to
be
a
good
citizen
in
this
country
and
comply
with
the
water
control
programs
of
the
federal
on
state
government.
mr.
harold
gondelman
it
was
disputed
in
the
record.
excuse
me
your
honor,
it
was
disputed
but
i
tried
to
prove
it
in
two
ways.
first
of
all,
exhibit
g
which
i
offered
in
evidence
and
attempted
to
argue
to
the
jury
shows
the
schedule
of
permits,
the
dollar
cost
of
all
permits.
there
is
nothing
in
exhibit
g
that
would
indicate
that
this
permit
would’ve
been
required
or
that
there
was
a
charge
for
it
or
included
in
exhibit
g.
the
other
is
the
twofold,
first
that
mr.
rockel
says
and
i
have
that
as
part
of
my
brief
actually
in
an
interview
had
said,
i
think
it’s
on
page
7
(a)
of
my
brief
your
honor,
and
i’m
prepared
to
prove
this.
mr.
rockel
has
theoretically
should
know
something
about
the
act
of
1899
since
today
he
is
the
one
in
charge
of
the
administration
of
the
program,
was
asked
if
there
was
an
overlapping
in
the
statutes.
second
paragraph
he
says
“it
really
isn’t
entirely
fair
to
say
that
the
reason
a
person
is
being
sued
under
the
refuse
act
is
because
they
don’t
have
a
permit.
they
couldn’t
get
one
if
they
wanted
to.”
until
the
permit
program
of
the
corps
of
engineers
was
in
that
slate
last
year,
after
the
presidential
proclamation,
we
didn’t
have
any
permit
program
for
the
discharge
of
waste
into
a
stream.
so
that
under
his
own
admission,
under
the
exhibits
which
i
did
offer
and
i
would
be
pleased
to
leave
these
--
these
are
maintained
by
me,
i
didn’t
realize
the
court
of
appeals
accepted
that.
mr.
harold
gondelman
no
sir,
because
if
i
were
dumping
a
solid
into
the
river
then
we
are
under
the
republic
steel
case
and
the
history,
and
then
republic
steel
since
1904.
mr.
harold
gondelman
well,
it
would
in
this
sense,
your
honor.
mr.
harold
gondelman
if
there
was
no
permit
program
whatsoever?
mr.
harold
gondelman
i
don’t
think
we
could
be
prosecuted
under
this
law.
mr.
harold
gondelman
right,
and
then
we
would
not
have
this
case.
that’s
why
i
said
originally
i
--
mr.
harold
gondelman
well,
because
this
case
and
your
honor’s
case
are
two
different
cases,
and
the
facts
of
my
case
--
mr.
harold
gondelman
no,
you
don’t
have
this
case
because,
your
honor,
since
1899
everybody
in
this
county
knew
that
the
act
of
1899
affected
the
discharge
of
solids
into
a
stream.
the
republic
steel
case
only
made
new
law
because
it
took
a
civil
procedure
and
permitted
an
injunction.
mr.
harold
gondelman
not
complete,
my
argue
--
mr.
harold
gondelman
my
argument
is
--
mr.
harold
gondelman
what
i’m
saying
your
honor,
and
the
reason
i
can’t
fit
a
factual
situation
into
your
hypothetical
factual
situation
is
simply
this,
it
doesn’t
stop
with
the
narrow
factual
situation
you’re
presenting
to
me,
i
respectfully
suggest.
what
i’m
saying
to
you
is
this,
change
your
factual
situation
just
a
little
bit
for
me
and
say
that
solids
are
being
dumped
into
the
river
and
for
70
years
the
corps
of
engineers
says
you
don’t
need
a
permit
to
dump
those
solids
into
the
river,
and
then
have
a
criminal
prosecution,
and
then
i
say
of
course
the
government
can
not
lead
an
industry
into
entrapment.
mr.
harold
gondelman
it’s
an
affirmative
--
the
court
of
appeals
said
we
were
misled,
and
that
is
a
very
basic
factor.
mr.
harold
gondelman
and
if
effect
i’m
saying
we
had
a
permit
because
the
state
want
it.
mr.
harold
gondelman
basically,
that
is
second
part
of
my
case
that
is
correct
your
honor.
mr.
harold
gondelman
it
is
in
part,
because
in
the
first
situation
we’re
saying
that
without
any
permit
program
whatsoever.
mr.
harold
gondelman
well,
it
would
hold
real
solids,
you
see,
but
not
real
water.
i
mean
we
have
to
talk
about
water
and
--
mr.
harold
gondelman
unless
the
government
affirmatively
misled
the
industry
into
believing
they
could
do
--
mr.
harold
gondelman
fine,
i’d
stand
on
that
argument
as
well.
thank
your
honor.
mr.
harold
gondelman
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
listening
to
the
government’s
argument
today
reminds
me
very
much
of
the
lyrics
of
the
mikado,
where
mr.
gilbert
said
the
flowers
that
bloom
in
the
spring
tra
la,
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
case.
and
the
government’s
argument
has
nothing
to
do
with
this
case.
he
did
not
tell
you
mr.
justice
powell,
that
the
first
attorney
in
the
history
of
the
united
states
since
march
3,
1899
who
has
fought
a
case
under
that
act
through
to
a
jury
verdict
is
me.
that’s
the
first
and
only
case
that
has
come
before
this
court
on
a
trial
in
a
courtroom,
and
your
honors
have
specifically
reserved
that,
and
that
is
why
i
did
not
go
through
motions
and
have
the
case
come
up
here
in
the
vacuum
that
it
did
in
republic
steel
and
standard
oil.
you
have
to
have
the
facts
of
the
case,
and
in
fact
in
the
opinion
of
this
court
in
standard
oil,
the
last
paragraph
says,
we
pass
only
on
the
quality
of
the
pollutant
not
on
the
quantity
of
proof
necessary
to
support
a
conviction
nor
on
the
question
as
to
what
scienter
requirement
the
act
imposes
as
those
questions
are
not
before
the
court
on
that
restricted
appeal.
interestingly
enough
in
the
footnote,
since
having
dealt
with
the
construction
placed
by
the
court
below
on
the
sherman
act,
our
jurisdiction
on
this
appeal
is
exhausted.
we
are
not
at
liberty
to
consider
other
objections
to
the
indictment
or
objections
which
may
arise
upon
the
trial
with
respect
to
the
merits
of
the
charge.
i
don’t
know
what
they
mean
the
criminal
charge
or
the
charge
of
the
court.
i
did
attack
both
of
those
before
the
court
below.
now,
being
trial
counsel
in
the
case
perhaps
gives
me
a
little
advantage.
i’m
a
bit
appalled
when
the
government
tells
this
court
that
there
was
no
offer
in
the
court
below
to
prove
that
the
discharges
of
which
we
stand
convicted
comply
with
the
water
quality
standards
of
the
government
of
the
united
states
say
“you
have
this
anomalous
situation.”
picco
has
been
fined
$10,000.00
for
violating
a
criminal
statute
which
the
government
of
the
united
states
says
is
not
a
pollution
discharge
under
its
own
water
quality.
now,
i
would
refer
you
to
page
158
of
the
appendix
that
the
government
printed.
despite
the
efforts
of
the
court
below
to
keep
me
from
making
a
record
that
this
court
would
have,
i
insisted
that
certain
offers
be
made.
one
of
them
is,
i
also
want
to
be
on
record.
i
want
to
be
on
the
record
the
fact
that
in
connection
with
mr.
--
mr.
harold
gondelman
158
sir,
at
the
top.
mr.
lucani
incidentally
is
a
water
quality
control
expert
who
at
one
time
while
the
canoes
were
running
up
and
down
the
monongahela
river,
one
of
his
employees
filled
the
bottle
and
gave
it
to
one
of
the
bounty
hunters
in
the
canoe
so
that
he
would
have
it
to
take
back.
mr.
lucani’s
testimony,
he
would
have
testified
if
permitted
that
the
discharges
august
7th,
august
19th
that’s
the
discharges,
and
the
specific
analysis
on
every
matter
which
is
related
to
this
and
these
information
are
absolutely
within
the
prescribed
limits
of
the
pennsylvania
water
quality
standards.
this
case
was
tried
in
june
1972
and
i
intended
to
prove
as
late
as
june
1972
that
every
item
on
the
exhibits
that
the
government
have
the
chemical
analyses
and
attached
to
their
brief,
every
item
is
below
the
standards
that
the
pennsylvania
sanitary
water
board
in
charge
of
this
permits
under
our
state
permit,
permits
picco
to
discharge
in
the
monongahela
river.
and
the
court
said
yes
but
i’ve
overruled
that
and
to
make
sure
that
the
record
was
clear
i
said
“but
it
is
not
on
the
record”
and
i
wanted
to
be
that
every
matter
discharged
by
this
defendant,
picco,
is
within
the
prescribed
regulations
of
the
commonwealth
of
pennsylvania
which
have
been
adopted
by
the
government
of
the
united
states,
and
therefore
insofar
as
this
actually
relates
to
our
dumping,
the
case
is
referred
to
pollutants
and
refuse
interchangeably
and
as
to
the
government’s
own
regulations,
what
we
were
convicted
of
discharging
as
a
pollutant
is
not
a
pollutant.
and
we’ve
cited
in
our
brief
and
i
need
not
go
in
to
that,
but
the
government
has
adopted
specifically
the
pennsylvania
standards.
congress
has
specifically
said
that
the
primacy
of
enforcing
water
pollution
controls
is
in
the
states.
mr.
harold
gondelman
the
existence
of
the
offense.
i
tried
very
hard,
believe
me,
to
get
the
court
to
harmonize
the
water
quality
acts
which
were
passed
in
1965,
1970
and
the
refuse
act.
they
can
be
read
harmoniously
together
without
putting
the
government
of
the
united
states
into
the
box
that
it
has
painted
itself
by
actually
being
the
one
who
muddies
the
waters
of
this
whole
situation
more
than
anyone
else.
mr.
harold
gondelman
well,
of
course
i
find
that
argument
very
difficult
to
believe,
because
the
government
has
appealed
from
the
circuit’s
finding
number
one,
that
congress
intended
no
crime
under
the
facts
of
this
case,
and
two,
if
congress
did
intend
such
a
crime,
such
a
crime
would
violate
due
process.
i
don’t
know
how
this
court
considered
the
government’s
appeal
without
getting
into
the
merits
of
the
case
and
whether
or
not
a
crime
actually
was
committed.
and
on
the
issue
of
whether
a
crime
has
been
committed,
justice
rehnquist,
the
issue
seems
to
me
to
be
what
is
refuse
and
in
technology
and
mr.
lucani’s
testimony,
he
was
completely
almost
as
frustrated
as
i
because
he
could
not
talk
about
pollutant
and
refuse,
or
define
those
terms
because
he
said
“i
must
know
what
the
receptacle
is
into
which
the
effluent
is
being
discharged.”
you
see,
they
go
out
to
the
middle
of
the
monongahela
river
and
find
a
little
bit
of
iron
and
a
little
bit
of
sulfur
and
other
solids,
where
if
you
came
closer
to
the
river
and
the
millions
of
gallons,
and
i
think
even
their
test
expert
testified
billions
of
gallons
of
water.
in
water
pollution
science,
you
must
know
what
the
effluent
is
going
into
in
a
rate
of
water
flow
not
dissolve
and
evaporate
the
water
to
get
the
solids
out
and
make
these
exhibits
sound
like
these
were
actually
solids.
all
of
the
discharges
in
picco’s
plant
were
in
a
liquid
state,
not
solid.
and
the
fact
is
that
what
i
tried
to
do
is
say
to
the
court,
the
word
pollutant
has
a
scientific
present
technology
definition.
how
can
you
charge
a
jury
that
we
have
no
permit
to
discharge
refuse,
if
in
the
science
and
technology
today
it
is
not
refuse
as
that
term
is
defined
by
the
very
science
trying
to
work
to
clean
up
the
stream.
mr.
lucani
would’ve
testified
and
i
cited
on
the
brief
the
fact
that
pennsylvania
and
the
federal
government
defined
pollutants
as
things
above
a
certain
standard,
above
a
certain
discharge
rate,
and
mr.
lucani
continuously
said
“i
cannot
tell
you
if
this
is
refuse
since,
your
honor,
you
have
told
me
i
can’t
talk
about
what
it
goes
into
and
the
rate
of
the
flow
of
the
stream,
in
other
words,
you
can’t
let
me
testify
as
an
expert
which
i
am
trying
to
do.”
mr.
harold
gondelman
it
doesn’t
hinge
on
that
but
it
hinges
on
this
your
honor,
the
question
asked
was
if
there
was
no
permit
program,
is
there
a
crime
a
committed?
i
must
first
say
that
such
a
finding
with
i
think
about
the
court’s
approach
to
this
case,
the
lower
courts
understanding
of
this
case
in
light
of
republic
steel
and
standard
oil
was
that
it’s
like
when
he
was
in
bolivia
they
told
him
that
he
couldn’t
carry
a
cigarette
lighter
without
a
permit.
he
went
down
to
get
the
cigarette
lighter,
they
say
“we
don’t
have
permits”
they
confiscated
the
cigarette
lighter,
and
this
is
the
way
this
whole
case
was
tried.
the
court
continually
said
to
me
that
whether
we
--
mr.
harold
gondelman
i
don’t
have
to
reach
another
ground
your
honor,
what
i’m
saying
is
that
under
these
circumstances,
the
court
of
appeals
has
said
that
without
a
permit
program
and
that
i
should
be
entitled
to
prove
whether
or
not
there
was
a
permit
program
in
effect,
because
after
all
the
regulations
and
the
statute
itself.
unfortunately,
the
government
doesn’t
quote
these
things
completely
to
the
court,
if
they
read
the
complete
provided
further
however
quote
of
the
act
of
1899,
incidentally
it’s
interesting
that
up
until
1969,
this
was
the
rivers
and
harbors
act
of
1899.
congress
has
not
amended
that
act.
the
government
has
amended
it
by
continually
referring
to
it
as
the
refuse
act.
it
becomes
the
refuse
act
on
december
23,
1970
in
the
presidential
proclamation
when
he
referred
to
the
refuse
act
of
1899,
but
the
act
itself
section
13
says
“and
provided
further
that
the
secretary
of
the
army,
whenever
in
the
judgment
of
the
chief
of
engineers
anchorage
and
navigation
will
not
be
injured
thereby.”
the
government
hasn’t
read
the
next
clause
to
you
comma
“may
permit
that
deposit
of
any
material
above
mentioned
in
navigable
waters,
within
limits
to
be
defined
and
under
conditions
to
be
prescribed
by
him,”
then
it
says
“provided
applications
made
to
him
prior
to
the
deposit
of
such
material.”
now,
the
courts
had
been,
the
lower
courts
especially
have
been
very
concerned
about
whether
the
phrase
comes
after
the
semicolon
or
before
the
semicolon,
i
don’t
know
how
anyone
would
diagram
this
sentence
at
all.
it
would
be
an
impossibility
but
it
certainly
seems
to
me
that
as
the
phrases
flow
the
secretary
may
permit
the
deposit
of
materials
within
limits
to
be
defined
and
under
conditions
prescribed
by
him.
and
what
we
find
actually
is
that
in
413
of
the
act
that
is
33
u.s.c.
413.
“the
department
of
justice
shall
conduct
the
legal
proceedings
under
section
407
and
it
shall
be
the
duty
of
united
states
attorneys
to
vigorously
prosecute
all
offenders
against
the
same.”
this
was
passed
on
march
3,
1899
with
the
act
we’re
concerned
about.
i
happened
to
check,
i
find
that
there’re
28
attorneys
general
to
the
united
states,
five
of
whom
have
graced
this
honorable
court,
and
yet
we
find
that
no
vigorous
prosecution
except
for
the
act
of
1899
affecting
navigation.
next
we
find,
section
419,
this
was
a
new
statute
passed
in
1905
in
which
congress
said
“the
secretary
of
the
army
is
authorized
and
empowered
to
prescribe
regulations
to
govern
the
transportation
and
dumping
into
any
navigable
waters,
or
waters
adjacent
there
to
have
dredging
the
earth’s
garbage
and
other
refuse
materials
of
every
kind
and
description.”
the
exact
language
in
the
act
of
section
407,
the
secretary
must
prescribe
regulations
concerning
the
dumping
among
other
things
other
refuse
materials
of
every
kind
or
description
whenever
in
his
judgment
navigation
will
not
be
affected
thereby.
so
i
say
that
the
secretary
of
the
army,
if
this
was
a
pollution
statute
and
if
we
require
the
permit,
he
had
a
duty
to
set
forth
in
regulations
what
the
permit
would
be.
i
offered
these
exhibits
in
evidence
and
they’re
part
of
my
brief.
i
think
they’re
exhibit
7,
8
and
9.
in
1939
and
this
comes
to
the
court
of
appeals
argument,
justice
white,
that
the
administrative
rulings
and
interpretations
caused
picco
not
to
apply
for
a
permit
any
more
than
ask
if
anything
else
were
required.
in
1939,
the
information
circular
says
“applications
for
authority
to
execute
work
or
erect
structures
into
navigable
waters
of
the
united
states”
nothing
about
pollution
in
this
circular.
this
was
secured
by
subpoena
to
the
corps
of
engineers
to
bring
with
them
all
of
the
regulations
they
had
ever
published
under
section
407,
this
they
brought.
mr.
harold
gondelman
this
was
1939,
mr.
justice
stewart.
now,
then
brought
to
me,
since
we
hear
that
the
regulation
was
somehow
changed
in
1968
after
some
of
the
decisions
of
this
court
which
went
beyond
the
factual
situations
in
those
cases.
they
then
show
how
well
they
amended
it
in
1968,
permits
for
work
in
navigable
waters.
this
is
the
administrative
ruling
and
publication
which
was
given
to
everyone.
then
we
find,
now
we
say
that
this
is
after
the
presidential
proclamation
which
incidentally
had
a
moratorium
in
the
date
you
asked
about,
justice
blackmun,
was
very
important.
these
informations
are
filed
in
april
1971.
in
december,
the
president
issued
an
order
to
implement
a
permit
program
and
you
had
until
july
1st
to
apply
for
a
permit,
so
that
under
the
president’s
own
proclamation
of
december
23,
there
was
an
attempted
moratorium
to
get
people
to
now
understand
what
had
never
been
the
law
of
this
country
that
you
needed
a
permit,
because
in
1971,
the
same
regulation
now
says
permits
for
work
and
structures
in
and
for
discharge
or
deposits
into
navigable
water.
and
now
we
get
to
the
need
for
a
permit
and
it’s
not
a
letter
like
judge
teitelbaum
kept
telling
me,
but
the
permits
are
5,
6
and
7
pages
and
require
thousands
and
thousands
of
dollars
to
determine
the
quantity
of
the
effluent,
the
vast
technological
data
that
is
needed
in
order
to
apply
for
a
permit.
mr.
harold
gondelman
they’re
only
in
the
record
in
this
way
justice
black
--
powell
that
i
offered
them,
they
were
put
in
this
envelope
and
i
have
added
them
to
my
brief,
and
therefore,
you
will
find
simply
the
cover
as
an
appendix
to
my
brief.
i
did
not
duplicate
it
because
i
was
afraid
the
brief
would
simply
get
out
of
hand.
but
you
find
that
exhibit
9
as
the
1971
regulation,
exhibit
8
the
1968
regulation.
i
have
duplicated
a
few
sections
which
show
that
--
actually
the
regulation
says
since
republic
steel,
the
secretary
of
the
army
must
now
with
the
corps
of
engineers
find
out
how
they
get
industry
to
pay
for
dredging
the
calumet
river
in
effect,
because
the
solids
were
building
up.
mr.
harold
gondelman
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
harold
gondelman
only,
your
honor,
if
the
theory
as
i
have
it
is
that
the
finder
of
fact,
that
we’re
going
to
a
jury.
under
the
court’s
theory
of
this
case,
there
was
really
no
point
in
trying
and
i
think
you
plead
guilty
because
you
have
no
defense.
you
don’t
have
a
permit
he
says
this
thru
“the
only
way
you
can
avoid
liability
and
criminal
culpability
is
show
me
if
you
have
a
permit,
or
that
you
didn’t
know
that
you
were
putting
this
stuff
in
the
river.”
now,
the
fact
is
we
knew
we
were
putting
it
in
the
river
and
we
knew
that
we
didn’t
have
a
permit,
but
i
was
offering
in
evidence
at
the
trial
a
number
of
things.
we’re
talking
now
about
scienter,
i
thought
i
would
get
a
charge
on
mens
rea
because
it’s
reserved.
this
honorable
court
hasn’t
decided
whether
it’s
malum
prohibitum,
if
it
is
of
course
then
all
industry
should’ve
been
closed
and
for
70
years
in
this
country.
but
if
there
is
any
scienter
required
i
felt
that
the
actual
publications
of
the
government
of
the
united
states
telling
us
whether
we
needed
a
permit
would
be
necessary
to
prove
in
the
court.
not
only
that
--
mr.
harold
gondelman
okay,
thank
you.[lunch
recess]
mr.
harold
gondelman
or
really,
whether
the
case
has
a
criminal
violation
inherent
in
it
at
all,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
the
point
--
mr.
harold
gondelman
i
did
not
cross-petition,
however,
the
--
mr.
harold
gondelman
i’ll
cover
it
in
less
time
than
that.
we
have
to
look
at
the
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals
to
see
what
this
court
granted
certiorari
from,
and
the
court
of
appeals
specifically
held
that
the
due
process
violations,
in
answer
to
mr.
justice
rehnquist’s
questions,
how
did
i
offer
this?
the
fact
that
i
offered
this
in
the
trial
is
what
this
court
of
appeals
and
that
is
what
is
now
before
this
court,
i
may
respectfully
suggest,
because
the
court
of
appeals
held
two
things.
one,
congress
never
intended
a
crime
under
the
facts
of
this
case.
from
that
the
government
has
appealed
and
that
is
what
is
before
this
court,
so
the
court
must
now
decide
whether
a
crime
has
been
committed.
mr.
harold
gondelman
because
they
held
that
at
least
offers
of
proof
should
have
been
affirmatively
allowed.
mr.
harold
gondelman
that
is
correct.
and
if
the
evidence,
the
effect
of
the
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
if
i
can
prove
the
exhibits
which
i
shown
this
court
namely
that
there
was
no
permit
program,
that
the
corps
of
engineers
did
not
believe
that
a
permit
program
affecting
pollution
rather
than
navigation
was
necessary,
that
there
was
no
crime
committed
under
facts
of
this
case.
and
i
think
that
by
reversing,
they
simply
say
“put
that
evidence
before
a
court”
and
i’m
entitled
to
a
directive
verdict.
mr.
harold
gondelman
that
would
be
before
the
district
court
unless
this
court
were
to
find
as
the
court
of
appeals
found
that
if
there
was
no
permit
program
which
is
throughout
everybody
but
the
department
of
justice
agrees
that
there
was
no
permit
program.
and
it
is
definitely
before
this
court
because
the
second
holding
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
that
the
circumstances
here
demonstrate
that
no
crime
was
committed.
and
in
that
connection,
they
discussed
the
regulations
of
the
corps
of
engineers.
they
discussed
the
lack
of
any
affirmative
permit
program.
they
discussed
the
fact
that
we
were
affirmatively
told
that
they
was
no
permit
program
required
until
1970,
and
then
in
the
third
part
of
the
opinion
it
says
“even
if
the
act
of
1899
were
construed
to
make
picco’s
activities
criminal,
due
process
considerations
would
require
a
reversal”
and
in
that
situation
he
says
that
picco
acclaims
that
it
was
misled
by
interpretation
given
to
the
statute
by
the
corps
of
engineers,
and
this
is
where
we
get
to
the
offers
of
evidence,
none
of
which
was
admitted
in
the
court
below,
but
which
are
attached
to
the
brief
for
the
consideration
of
this
court.
so
i
do
believe
that
the
government’s
petition
for
cert
and
this
court
having
granted
cert
directly
places
before
this
court.
was
a
crime
committed
at
all
if
the
authors
in
the
court
below
had
been
allowed?
now,
i
think
we
briefly
ought
to
get
to
the
effect
of
what
the
government
is
saying
here.
since
taylor
versus
reeser
(ph),
the
government
has
been
enjoined
from
issuing
permits.
now,
if
we
understand
the
government’s
argument
today,
then
under
the
administrative
absolutism
that
the
department
of
justice
as
it
has,
every
industry
in
this
country
since
the
injunction
has
been
issued
where
no
permits
are
now
available
by
a
court
injunction,
every
industry
that
has
been
discharging
without
a
permit
is
guilty
of
a
crime
obviously.
it
has
to
be
the
logical
conclusion
of
the
government’s
argument
before
this
court
today.
we
know
that
you
cannot
get
a
permit
today
because
of
that
decision,
it’s
on
appeal
but
at
least
for
a
year,
a
year
and
a
half
now
nobody
could
get
a
permit.
and
yet
a
u.s.
attorney
certainly
could
prosecute
any
industry
discharging
into
a
navigable
stream
matters
which
did
not
affect
navigation
because
they
don’t
have
a
permit,
because
after
all,
what
difference
does
it
make?
they
don’t
have
a
permit
only
because
the
court
has
enjoined
the
government
permission
legally?
and
if
they
have
not
committed
--
if
industry
has
not
committed
a
crime
during
the
pendency
of
that
injunction,
then
why
doesn’t
it
logically
follow
that
before
the
injunction
if
there
was
no
permit
program,
there
also
was
no
crime
committed.
mr.
rockel
says,
the
director
of
the
epa
says
that
there’s
no
question
that
no
one
could
get
a
permit
under
the
act
of
1899,
i
have
his
citation
in
my
brief,
so
that
without
a
permit
program
because
of
court
injunction
or
prior
to
that,
certainly
there
is
no
crime
committed
here
and
that
issue
has
been
decided
by
the
court
of
appeals.
the
court
below
took
the
position
completely
that
it
does
not
make
any
difference
whether
we
could
get
a
permit.
the
only
way
that
we
could
not
violate
the
law
is
not
to
discharge
effluent
into
a
river.
i
suggest
that
if
acquisition
had
been
taken
by
united
states
attorney
in
1944
when
industry
was
going
full
blast
to
supply
the
war
material
for
the
boys
in
omaha
beach
in
world
war
ii,
and
the
effect
of
that
type
of
criminal
prosecution
would
have
been
to
advice
industry
to
close
its
doors,
the
u.s.
attorney
would’ve
been
subject
to
uncertain
great
criticism
if
not
internment
for
having
taking
an
american
activities
approaches
to
the
law.
the
fact
that
they
didn’t
in
1943,
1944
in
fact
the
fact
that
the
secretary
of
army
awarded
--
awards
to
industry
during
those
periods
are
national
crisis
certainly
would
indicate
that
there
is
no
criminal
violation
and
they
compounded
in
this
case.
the
court
below
charged
the
jury
that
if
the
secretary
of
the
army
in
his
discretion
decided
not
to
issue
permits,
despite
the
fact
that
my
entire
offer
was
to
show
that
the
secretary
of
the
army
had
actually
exercised
this
discretion
saying
that
no
permits
were
required.
in
fact
in
the
1968
regulations
when
they
talk
about
the
republic
steel
case,
the
only
change
the
core
of
engineers
saw
was
that
under
republic
steel,
they
were
now
obligated
to
assess
who
should
pay
dredging.
i
think
what
has
happened
in
this
situation
and
the
metamorphosis
so
called,
they
change
from
the
rivers
and
harbors
act
to
a
refuse
act
unfortunately
comes
abide
in
this
way.
republic
steel
came
before
this
court
on
a
petition
by
the
government
of
the
united
states
and
if
you
read
their
briefs,
you
will
find
that
they
affirmatively
told
this
court
that
they
are
not
in
a
pollution
case,
they
are
in
a
navigation
case.
the
entire
brief
on
both
sides
talk
about
navigation,
the
opinion
of
this
court
says
we
have
pollution
statute
but
that
is
over
to
think
those
were
the
facts
that
were
before
this
court.
then
you
--
from
there,
we
are
led
to
standard
oil,
an
accidental
discharge
in
which
the
court
defined
good
gasoline
aviation
fuel
as
a
pollutant.
from
those
two
cases
we
have
now
jumped
the
complete
line
to
say
that
we
now
have
in
the
united
states
and
as
i
said,
now
they
talk
about
a
refuse
act,
but
i
think
that
when
you
see
the
presidential
regulations
proclamation
of
december
23,
1970,
you
must
ask
yourself
why
did
the
president
of
the
united
states
take
time
from
a
busy
schedule
to
issue
a
proclamation
implementing
a
permit
program
and
talking
about
all
of
the
laws
dealing
with
water
control
in
the
implementation
of
that
program.
he
did
it
because
there
was
no
such
program.
the
water
pollution
control
act
of
‘65,
‘70,
‘72
can
be
harmoniously
read
with
the
act
of
1899
if
one
defines
pollution
in
terms
of
those
acts.
this
case
has
no
impact
whatsoever
on
future
cases
because
of
the
act
of
1972,
the
government
admits
that.
this
case
and
the
thing
that
it
must
be
understood
here
is
that
this
case
is
not
a
pollution
case.
it
has
been
brought
here
without
attractiveness
on
the
times
of
today,
but
the
fact
is
that
it
is
not
a
pollution
case
because
if
we
are
complying
with
state
and
federal
standards
concerning
what
went
into
the
river,
we
could
put
the
same
thing
into
the
monongahela
river
today
and
i
offer
to
prove
that
that
we
did
in
1970
because
they
are
within
the
standards
of
the
government
of
the
united
states.
the
reply
brief
of
the
government
again
misrepresents
what
i
offered
to
prove.
it
said
that
i
offered
to
prove
that
we
would
comply
with
the
1974
standards
that
is
not
the
offer
of
proof.
commonwealth
of
pennsylvania
passed
clean
streams
legislation
before
the
federal
government
found
out
that
there
was
a
problem.
our
act
was
passed
in
1937
the
federal
act
1948.
i
offer
to
prove
that
under
the
present
pennsylvania
standards
which
are
among
the
highest
in
the
country,
they
intelligently
to
deal
with
the
economy
and
the
ecology
and
the
technology
that
is
available
said
by
december
31,
1974
these
will
be
the
new
standards
that
will
be
applicable
to
effluent
discharges
in
streams
of
this
commonwealth.
i
offer
to
prove
that
picco
is
already
in
the
process
and
was
when
the
canoes
floated
up
and
down
the
river
ready
in
the
process
of
building
a
$300,000.00
additional
water
treatment
plant
to
meet
the
new
standards
which
were
effective
and
will
be
effective
december
31,
1974.
you
do
not
have
as
the
government
untruthfully
tells
this
court
in
its
reply
brief,
the
largest
polluter
in
the
monongahela
river.
you
have
a
company
that
has
accepted
its
responsibilities,
understands
its
responsibilities
and
the
only
thing
the
government
has
done
in
this
prosecution
has
attempted
to
turn
off
an
industry
that
recognizes
that
it
is
trying
to
be
a
good
citizen
in
this
country
and
comply
with
the
water
control
programs
of
the
federal
on
state
government.
mr.
harold
gondelman
it
was
disputed
in
the
record.
excuse
me
your
honor,
it
was
disputed
but
i
tried
to
prove
it
in
two
ways.
first
of
all,
exhibit
g
which
i
offered
in
evidence
and
attempted
to
argue
to
the
jury
shows
the
schedule
of
permits,
the
dollar
cost
of
all
permits.
there
is
nothing
in
exhibit
g
that
would
indicate
that
this
permit
would’ve
been
required
or
that
there
was
a
charge
for
it
or
included
in
exhibit
g.
the
other
is
the
twofold,
first
that
mr.
rockel
says
and
i
have
that
as
part
of
my
brief
actually
in
an
interview
had
said,
i
think
it’s
on
page
7
(a)
of
my
brief
your
honor,
and
i’m
prepared
to
prove
this.
mr.
rockel
has
theoretically
should
know
something
about
the
act
of
1899
since
today
he
is
the
one
in
charge
of
the
administration
of
the
program,
was
asked
if
there
was
an
overlapping
in
the
statutes.
second
paragraph
he
says
“it
really
isn’t
entirely
fair
to
say
that
the
reason
a
person
is
being
sued
under
the
refuse
act
is
because
they
don’t
have
a
permit.
they
couldn’t
get
one
if
they
wanted
to.”
until
the
permit
program
of
the
corps
of
engineers
was
in
that
slate
last
year,
after
the
presidential
proclamation,
we
didn’t
have
any
permit
program
for
the
discharge
of
waste
into
a
stream.
so
that
under
his
own
admission,
under
the
exhibits
which
i
did
offer
and
i
would
be
pleased
to
leave
these
--
these
are
maintained
by
me,
i
didn’t
realize
the
court
of
appeals
accepted
that.
mr.
harold
gondelman
no
sir,
because
if
i
were
dumping
a
solid
into
the
river
then
we
are
under
the
republic
steel
case
and
the
history,
and
then
republic
steel
since
1904.
mr.
harold
gondelman
well,
it
would
in
this
sense,
your
honor.
mr.
harold
gondelman
if
there
was
no
permit
program
whatsoever?
mr.
harold
gondelman
i
don’t
think
we
could
be
prosecuted
under
this
law.
mr.
harold
gondelman
right,
and
then
we
would
not
have
this
case.
that’s
why
i
said
originally
i
--
mr.
harold
gondelman
well,
because
this
case
and
your
honor’s
case
are
two
different
cases,
and
the
facts
of
my
case
--
mr.
harold
gondelman
no,
you
don’t
have
this
case
because,
your
honor,
since
1899
everybody
in
this
county
knew
that
the
act
of
1899
affected
the
discharge
of
solids
into
a
stream.
the
republic
steel
case
only
made
new
law
because
it
took
a
civil
procedure
and
permitted
an
injunction.
mr.
harold
gondelman
not
complete,
my
argue
--
mr.
harold
gondelman
my
argument
is
--
mr.
harold
gondelman
what
i’m
saying
your
honor,
and
the
reason
i
can’t
fit
a
factual
situation
into
your
hypothetical
factual
situation
is
simply
this,
it
doesn’t
stop
with
the
narrow
factual
situation
you’re
presenting
to
me,
i
respectfully
suggest.
what
i’m
saying
to
you
is
this,
change
your
factual
situation
just
a
little
bit
for
me
and
say
that
solids
are
being
dumped
into
the
river
and
for
70
years
the
corps
of
engineers
says
you
don’t
need
a
permit
to
dump
those
solids
into
the
river,
and
then
have
a
criminal
prosecution,
and
then
i
say
of
course
the
government
can
not
lead
an
industry
into
entrapment.
mr.
harold
gondelman
it’s
an
affirmative
--
the
court
of
appeals
said
we
were
misled,
and
that
is
a
very
basic
factor.
mr.
harold
gondelman
and
if
effect
i’m
saying
we
had
a
permit
because
the
state
want
it.
mr.
harold
gondelman
basically,
that
is
second
part
of
my
case
that
is
correct
your
honor.
mr.
harold
gondelman
it
is
in
part,
because
in
the
first
situation
we’re
saying
that
without
any
permit
program
whatsoever.
mr.
harold
gondelman
well,
it
would
hold
real
solids,
you
see,
but
not
real
water.
i
mean
we
have
to
talk
about
water
and
--
mr.
harold
gondelman
unless
the
government
affirmatively
misled
the
industry
into
believing
they
could
do
--
mr.
harold
gondelman
fine,
i’d
stand
on
that
argument
as
well.
thank
your
honor.
