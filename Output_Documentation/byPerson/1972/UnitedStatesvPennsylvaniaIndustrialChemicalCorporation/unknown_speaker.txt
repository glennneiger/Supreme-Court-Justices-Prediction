mr.
reynolds,
how
significant
is
the
decision
in
this
case?
i
gather
there
are
pending
other
criminal
prosecutions
pending,
but
how
about
for
the
future?
unknown
speaker
how
many
of
them
are
there?
unknown
speaker
with
respect
in
the
future,
once
those
--
that
program
is
implemented.
people
are
still
going
to
have
to
get
a
permit,
aren’t
they?
unknown
speaker
but
maybe
they
could
get
one
on
these
circumstances,
but
if
they
don’t
get
one,
they
may
be
criminally
prosecuted?
unknown
speaker
not
on
the
--
unknown
speaker
but
because
of
that
act
modifies
this
one?
unknown
speaker
but
you
have
to
get
a
permit
--
the
reason
--
one
of
the
reasons
you
have
to
get
a
permit
is
to
satisfy
the
refuse
act.
unknown
speaker
maybe
someone
tracks
it
in
and
dumps
it?
unknown
speaker
or
an
accident?
unknown
speaker
mr.
reynolds,
i
think
you
mentioned
that
there’re
now
more
than
a
hundred
prosecutions
pending
under
the
1899
act.
how
many
prosecutions
were
there
between
1899
and
1970
when
this
prosecution
was
brought?

footnote
in
--
unknown
speaker
footnote
on
page
15
(a)
of
the
opinion
below
which
as
i
read
it
states
that
there
was
only
one
case
in
the
‘70
year
period
where
the
prosecuting
authorities
pressed
criminal
charges
under
comparable
condition.
that
conviction
was
overturned,
page
15
(a)
of
your
petition
for
certiorari.
i
don’t
want
to
interrupt
your
argument,
i
just
wondered
what
about
you
challenged
that
statement
in
the
opinion
below,
but
if
you
don’t
recall
it
--
unknown
speaker
what
page
is
this
mr.
gondelman?
unknown
speaker
well,
this
case
doesn’t
hinge
on
this
one.
unknown
speaker
mr.
gondelman,
i
don’t
know
if
the
appeals
rely
heavily
on
its
conclusion
that
even
if
an
application
of
pendent
had
been
made,
no
pendent
could’ve
been
obtained
because
the
court’s
opinion
said
pendents
were
unavailable.
in
your
view
is
the
record
clear
on
that
or
is
that
disputed
in
the
record?
unknown
speaker
mr.
gondelman,
let’s
assume
you
were
dumping
solid
--
dumping
solid
metal
of
some
kind
that
unquestionably
was
a
pollutant
in
the
river.
let’s
just
assume
that
you
had
been.
would
you
say
that
there
was
any
doubt
into
the
refuse
act
which
you
could
be
prosecuted?
unknown
speaker
then
it
wouldn’t
make
any
difference
whether
you
had
a
permit
or
whether
you
applied
for
a
permit
or
not,
or
whether
there
was
a
permit
program
or
not,
wouldn’t
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
i’ll
just
you
again.
now,
you’re
dumping
solids
in
the
river,
let’s
assume
there
was
no
permit
program
at
the
time
that
you
dumped
the
solids
in
the
river.
now,
could
you
be
prosecuted
under
this
law
or
not?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
are
you
saying
and
we
must
then
construe
this
law
as
meaning
that
unless
there’s
a
permit
program,
you
may
not
be
prosecuted
even
if
you
were
dumping
admittedly
polluted
material
industry?
unknown
speaker
what
do
you
mean
you
wouldn’t
have
this
case?
unknown
speaker
well,
there
aren’t
two
different
cases
if
you
think
for
example
that
the
question
of
whether
this
was
refuse
is
foreclosed?
unknown
speaker
but
again
your
argument
turns
whether
or
not
a
permit
program
is
essential
to
permit
prosecution
under
the
refuse
act.
unknown
speaker
but
rather
substantial
--
unknown
speaker
well,
let’s
assume
for
the
moment
then
that
you
say
a
permit
program
is
not
essential
permit
prosecution
under
the
act
and
that
you
may
be
prosecuted
even
if
there
was
no
way
of
getting
a
permit?
unknown
speaker
so
sure
enough,
you’re
really
saying
then
that
it’s
not
just
the
existence
of
a
permit
program.
it’s
an
affirmative
representation
that
you
don’t
need
a
permit
or
anything
else
for
this.
it’s
just
as
though
you
had
a
permit.
unknown
speaker
well,
you’re
saying
in
effect,
you’re
saying
you
had
a
permit.
unknown
speaker
and
they
ended
to
be
prosecuted
when
you
had
a
permit
is
the
denial
of
due
process
that’s
really
your
case?
unknown
speaker
well,
is
that
any
different
from
the
first?
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
that
doesn’t
seem
to
hold
water
is
it,
if
you
are
dumping
real
solids
in
the
river?
unknown
speaker
well,
if
you
dump
that
solids
in
the
river,
it
wouldn’t
make
any
difference
whether
there
was
a
permit
program
or
not?
unknown
speaker
well,
that’s
the
secondary?
unknown
speaker
mr.
reynolds,
how
significant
is
the
decision
in
this
case?
i
gather
there
are
pending
other
criminal
prosecutions
pending,
but
how
about
for
the
future?
unknown
speaker
how
many
of
them
are
there?
unknown
speaker
with
respect
in
the
future,
once
those
--
that
program
is
implemented.
people
are
still
going
to
have
to
get
a
permit,
aren’t
they?
unknown
speaker
but
maybe
they
could
get
one
on
these
circumstances,
but
if
they
don’t
get
one,
they
may
be
criminally
prosecuted?
unknown
speaker
not
on
the
--
unknown
speaker
but
because
of
that
act
modifies
this
one?
unknown
speaker
but
you
have
to
get
a
permit
--
the
reason
--
one
of

you
mentioned
that
there’re

more
than
a

prosecutions
pending
under
the
1899
act.
how
many
prosecutions
were
there

and
1970
when
this
prosecution
was
brought?
