you’re
suggesting
that
the
navigable

are
irrelevant
whether
these

would
mean

would
passed
or
must
under
existing
regulation
act

with
the
state

justice

assume
for
the
moment
that
those
regulations
approved
by

these

could
continue
to
be
made?
justice

wouldn’t
that
have
some
significance
for
whether
or
not
a
criminal
prosecution
under
another
act
to
go
forward
for
making
these
very
discharges?
justice

so
for
this
prosecution
we’re
not
getting
a
permit,
not
whether
or
not
you
could
get
one
if
you
apply?
justice

i
think
one
thing
that
you
--
if
you
were
just
going
to
get
to
is
staying
that
court
of
appeals
judgment
on
the
ground
of
refuse,
but
something
else
that
you,
i
think
you
have
to
reach
some
other
grounds
as
distinguished?
