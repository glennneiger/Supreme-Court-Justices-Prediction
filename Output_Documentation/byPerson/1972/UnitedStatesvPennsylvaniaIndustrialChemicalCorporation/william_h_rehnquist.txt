the

does
this
part
of
you
argument
go
to
the
exist
--
to
the
existence
of
the
offense
so

or
to
the
existence
of
the
defense,
the
permit?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
understood
the
government’s
position
to
be
that
since
you
hadn’t
cross-petitioned
for
certiorari
from
the
third
circuit
that
the
existence
of
the

wasn’t
properly
here.
