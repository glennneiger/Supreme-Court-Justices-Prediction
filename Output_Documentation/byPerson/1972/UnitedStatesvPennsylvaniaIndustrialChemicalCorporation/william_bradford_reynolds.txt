mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
third
circuit.
to
review
that
court’s
judgment,
reversing
the
judgment
of
conviction
by
the
district
court
in
remanding
to
further
proceedings.
the
action
was
commenced
by
criminal
information
in
april
1971
against
respondent,
pennsylvania
industrial
chemical
corporation,
hereafter
referred
to
as
picco.
the
company
was
charged
in
four
counts
with
violating
section
13
of
the
rivers
and
harbors
act
of
1899,
the
so-called
refuse
act,
which
in
relevant
part
makes
it
unlawful
without
first
obtaining
permission
from
the
secretary
of
the
army
to
discharge
into
any
navigable
water
of
the
united
states.
“any
refuse
matter
of
any
kind
or
description
whatever,
other
than
that
flowing
from
streets
and
sewers
and
passing
therefrom
in
a
liquid
state.”
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
the
date
were
--
there
were
two
dates.
august
7
and
august
19,
1970.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
no,
your
honor,
i
don’t
know
why
they
--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
it
certainly
would’ve
made
a
much
different
--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
well,
at
least
nobody
apparently
was
sampling
the
discharges
on
the
monongahela
after
that
date,
but
the
date
of
the
offenses
though
were
august
7
and
august
19,
1970.
now,
the
discharges
involved
here
flowed
into
the
monongahela
river
admittedly
a
navigable
water
from
two
pipes
owned
by
picco
and
used
by
the
company
to
carry
off
treated
waste
matter
left
in
the
manufacture
of
chemical
compounds
used
in
industry.
one
of
the
pipes,
an
iron
pipe,
served
only
picco’s
plant.
the
other,
a
concrete
pipe,
served
the
plant
primarily,
but
was
also
used
by
six
private
residences
nearby
essentially
to
discard
used
laundry
water.
on
august
7
and
again
on
august
19,
1970,
the
discharges
from
the
two
pipes
were
sampled
by
private
citizens,
and
the
samples
were
turned
over
to
the
allegheny
county
bureau
of
test
for
chemical
analysis.
this
analysis
revealed
that
the
effluent
flowing
from
picco’s
pipe
contained
a
disproportionably
high
amount
of
aluminum,
some
iron,
chloride,
phosphate
and
other
chemicals
all
in
greater
amounts
than
were
found
in
the
midstream
waters
of
the
river,
and
an
unusually
high
quantity
of
suspended
solids.
at
trial,
picco
took
the
position
that
the
industrial
waste
it
was
discharging
into
the
monongahela
river
did
not
constitute
prohibited
refuse
matter
under
the
act.
first
it
argued
that
the
refuse
act
covers
only
river
deposits
that
impede
navigation,
not
non-impeding
liquid
solutions
of
the
sort
involved
here.
in
the
alternative
it
urged
that
the
discharge
from
its
plant
was
nothing
more
than
sewage,
and
thus
came
within
the
explicit
statutory
exception.
both
of
these
contentions
were
rejected
by
the
district
court.
they
were
renewed
in
the
court
of
appeals
and
also
rejected.
no
cross
petition
was
filed
by
respondent
in
this
court
seeking
further
review
of
those
rulings.
and
thus
the
application
of
the
refuse
act
to
discharges
of
the
type
involved
in
this
case
is
not
at
issue
here,
because
the
judgment
under
review
is
based
on
the
premise
that
the
act
apply
to
these
discharges.
rather,
the
issues
before
the
court
relate
essentially
to
the
second
proviso
in
the
act
which
provides
that
the
secretary
of
the
army
“may
permit”
the
deposit
of
otherwise
prohibited
material
in
navigable
waters
if
navigation
will
not
be
adversely
affected
thereby,
provided
that
application
is
made
to
the
secretary
prior
to
depositing
such
material.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
i’m
suggesting
that
that
is
irrelevant
for
purposes
of
this
case.
we
don’t
know
it
but
whether
they
would
or
would
not
satisfy
state
water
quality
standards,
i
say
is
not
relevant
for
--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
the
1967
state
quality
standards
for
the
commonwealth
of
pennsylvania
had
been
approved.
the
records
--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
assume
that
i
still
think
--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
it
would
have
significance,
your
honor,
to
the
extent
that
the
plant
sought
permission
from
the
federal
government
also
to
discharge.
the
1970
water
pollution
statutes
require
that
the
in
order
to
get
permission
from
the
federal
government,
a
certification
has
to
be
presented
that
you
do
meet
state
quality
standards,
so
--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
for
discharging
without
getting
a
permit,
without
getting
a
federal
permit,
or
without
getting
any
permission
from
the
federal
government.
it
does
not
concern
whether
if
application
had
been
made,
this
plant
could
have
gotten
a
permit.
we
don’t
know
on
this
record
or
on
the
base
of
the
operative
proof
whether
they
even
had
a
state
permit
that
the
state
certification
that
they
met
the
1967
standards.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
that’s
right,
but
it’s
irrelevant
because
they
never,
in
any
event,
they
never
presented
that
certification,
even
if
they
did
have
it
to
the
federal
government,
and
therefore,
sought
a
federal
permit.
it’s
irrelevant
if
they
just
hold
it
and
keep
it
in
their
office
which
will
be
all
that
they
offer
proof
in
any
event
would’ve
shown
had
it
incorporated
such
a
permit.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
well,
your
honor,
i
think
it’s
relatively
insignificant
for
the
future.
it
does
have
significance
with
respect
to
the
pending
criminal
and
civil
--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
there
are
now
115.
i
believe
115
pending
criminal
actions
and
70
pending
civil
injunctive
suits
under
the
act,
but
the
1972
water
pollution
control
act
which
does
require
setup
statutory
permit
program
and
provides
a
moratorium
in
essence
on
refuse
act
prosecutions
until
after
implementation
of
that
permit
plan
really
makes
this
particular
case
insignificant
in
the
future.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
people
will
still
have
to
get
a
permit,
but
--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
that’s
correct
your
honor,
but
i
believe
they
will
be
criminally
prosecuted
under
another
statute.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
i
believe
it
would
not
be
under
this
statute
it
would
rather
be
under
the
new
1972
water
pollution
control
act
amendment.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
well,
that
act
has
transferred
the
permit
authority
that
was
vested
under
this
act
and
the
secretary
has
transferred
it
to
the
environmental
protection
agency,
and
it
requires
now
that
you
get
your
permit
from
that
agency
and
i
think
that
--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
well,
i
believe
that
the
refuse
act
that
the
prosecution
will
proceed.
there
are
criminal
penalties
now
under
the
1972
act.
i
think
that
the
refuse
act
could
well
still
be
viable
for
non-point
source
emissions
because
the
1972
act
really
pertains
to
point
source
that
is
emissions
coming
from
pipes
directly
into
the
river.
where
your
refuse
act
prosecutions
in
the
future
rely
is
essentially
with
respect
to
matter
that’s
placed
on
the
bank
where
--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
or
that
type
of
situation.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
or
an
accident,
that’s
correct.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
well
--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
i
don’t
--
i
think
that
before
1968
your
honor,
that
there
were
relatively
few
prosecutions
brought.
that
in
1968
i
believe
that
there
were
something
like
30
or
40,
and
then
in
1969
that
is
when
the
government
really
began
to
use
this
particular
statute
to
reach
the
activity
that
we’re
talking
about
in
this
case,
so
that
most
of
the
prosecutions
that
are
set
forth
in
that
footnote
were
prosecutions
that
they
were
commenced
in
1960,
perhaps
late
‘68,
but
generally
1969,
‘70
and
‘71.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
that’s
right.
that
is
not
a
--
that
case,
in
fact
those
two
cases
do
not
involve
the
refuse
act.
they
involve
statutes
requiring
plumbers
to
get
a
license
before
they
could
operate
in
the
state
of
texas.
there
were
more
than
one
criminal
prosecution.
there
was
more
than
one
prosecution
under
this
act
before
this
particular
action
was
brought.
there
was
the
la
merced
case
in
1936.
there
were
a
couple
of
cases
prior
to
that.
there
was
the
ballard
oil
case,
of
course
we
have
the
two
cases
that
were
in
this
court,
republic
steel
and
standard
oil.
there
was
--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
the
standard
oil
case
was
a
criminal
case.
the
republic
steel
case
was
not.
there
was
a
decision
in
the
third
circuit
and
there
were
a
number
of
others.
so
it
was
certainly
more
than
one.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
that’s
correct,
yes
your
honor.
let
me
look
just
briefly
to
the
language
of
the
refuse
act
and
this
second
proviso.
the
act
itself
speaks
in
broad
terms.
it
bans
all
discharges
of
refuse
matter
into
navigable
rivers,
or
into
navigable
waters
except
sewage.
but
under
the
second
proviso,
the
secretary
of
the
army
“may
permit”
certain
forbidden
discharges
“provided
application
is
made
to
him
prior
to
depositing
such
material.”
now,
this
proviso
does
not
speak
in
terms
of
the
formal
regulatory
program.
what
congress
did
in
1899
was
to
vest
in
the
secretary
discretionary
authority,
in
those
instances
where
a
prior
application
is
made,
discretionary
authority
to
immunize
from
criminal
prosecution
discharges
that
would
otherwise
being
unlawful.
how,
when
and
in
what
circumstances
he
might
exercise
that
authority
were
left
to
him.
in
this
regard,
the
1899
refuse
act
was
no
different
from
the
predecessor
statutes
on
which
it
was
based,
neither
the
act
of
1890
nor
the
act
of
1894,
both
of
which
imposed
a
flat
ban
on
the
discharge
of
enumerated
substances
in
the
navigable
waters.
neither
of
those
statutes
called
for
the
establishment
of
a
formal
regulatory
program
under
which
permission
to
discharge
would
be
given.
instead,
the
decision
whether
to
permit
a
forbidden
discharge
was
left
in
those
earlier
statutes
to
the
discretion
of
the
secretary
of
war,
he
could
act
or
not
as
he
saw
fit
to
accept
particular
discharges
from
the
general
statutory
prohibition.
and
this
we
think
is
what
congress
intended
by
the
second
proviso
in
the
refuse
act.
if
the
secretary
wish
to
establish
a
formal
regulatory
program,
it
certainly
was
within
his
authority
to
do
so
under
this
proviso,
but
for
some
70
years,
he
chose
not
to
operate
on
that
basis,
rather
he
chose
to
act
informally
passing
on
applications
only
when
and
as
submitted.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
i
believe
that
if
congress
had
contemplated
that
and
it
contemplated
that
the
violation
of
the
statute
turned
on
compliance
with
that
program,
it
would
make
a
difference,
your
honor.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
i
thought
you
meant
if
the
language
had
required,
the
statute
required.
no,
i
think
it
would
not
make
any
difference
under
this
language
that
whether
there
was
a
program
set
out,
form
a
program
set
up
or
not
would
make
no
difference.
i
think
what
the
proviso
does
is
it
provides
a
limited
defense
to
a
refuse
act
prosecution
for
discharges
which
the
secretary
in
his
discretion
may
permit.
now,
under
the
court
of
appeals
decision
that
limited
defense
based
on
affirmative
action
taken
by
the
secretary
is
converted
to
an
absolute
defense
through
a
formal
permit
--
because
the
secretary
fails
to
exercise
his
discretion
through
a
formal
permit
program,
what
the
court
of
appeals
decision
does
is
turn
the
statute
on
its
head.
that
which
congress
in
1899
declared
to
be
generally
prohibited
that
is
the
continuous
discharge
of
industrial
waste
into
our
nation’s
waters
becomes
generally
permissible
in
the
absence
of
a
formal
regulatory
scheme
which
congress
did
not
prescribe.
now,
apparently
the
court
of
appeals
reached
this
result,
not
so
much
on
the
basis
of
the
language
or
the
history
of
the
refuse
act,
but
rather
on
the
basis
of
its
reading
of
later
congressional
enactments
in
the
water
quality
field,
particularly
the
water
pollution
control
act
of
1948
as
amended
through
1970
but
not
the
1972
amendments
which
have
alluded
to
and
which
were
enacted
after
this
decision.
but
this
water
quality
legislation,
the
court
of
appeals
suggest
can’t
be
reconciled
with
the
1899
prohibition,
unless
we
read
enforcement
of
that
prohibition
is
turning
on
the
existence
of
a
formal
regulatory
program.
i
might
just
interject
that
this
problem
of
reconciliation,
whatever
it
might
be
has
been
in
large
part
resolved
by
the
1972
amendments
where
congress
itself
incorporated
the
two
acts
in
essence
and
certainly
reconciled
them
in
that
legislation.
but
before
that
in
the
earlier
water
quality
legislation,
congress
provided
explicitly
that
that
water
quality
legislation
was
not
to
be
construed
as
impairing
or
affecting
the
prohibition
of
the
refuse
act.
moreover,
the
water
quality
legislation
and
the
refuse
act
don’t
across
purposes
as
the
court
of
appeals
seemed
to
suggest.
both
arraigned
that
the
same
end,
the
cleaning
up
the
nation’s
waters,
but
they
used
different
means
to
do
it.
now,
we’ve
spelled
out
in
our
brief
the
structure
of
the
water
pollution
control
act.
essentially
that
legislation
contemplates
a
cooperative
effort
by
the
states
and
the
federal
government
in
establishing
and
enforcing
water
quality
standards.
but
prior
to
1972,
that
is
the
new
amendment
in
1972
to
this
water
quality
legislation,
prior
to
that
time
the
water
quality
legislation
contained
no
penalty
provisions.
discharges
which
reduced
the
quality
of
the
receiving
body
of
water
below
the
set
standards
was
subject
only
to
lengthy
proceedings
which
could
possibly
ended
in
a
abatement
order.
thus,
the
refuse
act
which
was
saved
by
congress,
the
refuse
act
of
1899
essentially
provided
the
teeth
to
the
clean
water
program.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
we
don’t
know,
it
just
can’t
be
determined
your
honor
on
this
record
or
on
the
base
of
the
offers
of
proof.
we
have
a
permit
that’s
in
the
appendix
i
believe
the
respondent’s
brief,
state
permit
issued
in
1956
which
permitted
the
construction
of
the
plant
and
discharge
at
that
time.
the
state
of
pennsylvania’s
water
quality
standards
were
approved
in
1967
by
the
federal
government
and
there’s
no
indication
that
the
company
has
gotten
a
permit
--
a
certification
from
the
state
that
it
was
inline
with
the
1967
water
quality
standards,
but
--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
well,
i
think
that
would
be
first
inquiry
to
be
made
on
submission
of
an
application
to
the
federal
government
for
a
permit,
but
the
point
that
we’re
making
in
this
case
is
that
the
refuse
act
precludes
those
discharges
which
fail
to
meet
the
water
quality
standards,
and
also
even
those
that
arguably
do
meet
them
until
you
first
go
to
the
federal
government
and
get
permission.
now,
the
1970
water
quality
legislation
that’s
the
earlier
amendments
required
that
these
companies
submit
to
the
federal
government
certification
that
it
met
the
water
quality
standards
in
its
efforts
to
obtain
a
permit.
and
the
refuse
act
would
--
it
would
be
no
violation
if
they’d
gone
to
the
federal
government
and
they’d
submitted
a
certification
that
they
did
in
fact
comply
and
then
they’d
been
permitted
by
the
federal
government
to
discharge.
but
in
this
case,
we
don’t
have
any
inquiry
made
by
the
company
whatsoever
to
the
federal
government
with
respect
to
a
permit
for
these
particular
discharges.
now,
the
company’s
argument
is
that
they
were
affirmatively
misled
by
the
corps
of
engineers
into
believing
that
a
permit
wasn’t
required
in
this
situation
since
its
discharges
did
not
impede
navigation.
and
principal
reliance
with
this
argument
is
placed
on
the
corps
of
engineers
early
regulations,
which
in
1968
or
until
1968
indicated
that
the
corps
reviewed
its
responsibility
under
the
refuse
act
as
i
am
quoting
from
those
1968
regulations,
as
“directed
principally
against
the
discharges
of
those
materials
that
are
obstructive
or
injurious
to
navigation.”
now,
in
view
of
these
earlier
regulations
and
the
fact
that
there
were
many
industrial
plants
up
and
down
the
river
that
were
discharging
industrial
waste
in
the
same
manner,
picco
argues
that
it
could
properly
assume,
and
i
use
that
word
advisably,
it
did
not
go
to
the
corps
of
engineers
and
asked
about
these
discharges,
it
didn’t
make
any
inquiry.
it
says
that
it
could
properly
assume
that
it
needed
no
federal
authorization
for
its
non-impeding
discharge.
well,
i
think
this
court
in
1966
made
it
clear
in
the
standard
oil
case
that
the
refuse
act
proscribes
discharges
of
refuse
matter
having
no
adverse
effect
on
navigation
to
the
same
extent
as
it
prescribes
those
discharges
that
in
fact
impede
navigation.
and
the
fact
that
the
1899
statute
had
not
for
many
years
been
enforced
as
vigorously
with
respect
to
the
non-impeding
discharges
cannot
be
held
to
diminish
its
force
today.
we
think
the
essential
point
here
is
that
following
the
standard
oil
decision,
the
corps
of
engineers
changed
its
view
of
its
responsibilities
under
the
refuse
act
with
the
respect
to
administering
activities
in
navigable
waterways.
and
as
we
spelled
out
in
our
brief,
the
regulations
issued
--
no,
the
regulations
on
which
picco
relies
were
withdrawn
in
1968.
new
regulations
were
issued
by
the
corps
and
they
were
published
in
the
federal
register,
and
they
served
notice
that
the
corps
will
consider
pollution
and
conservation
factors
in
passing
on
applications
for
permission
to
use
navigable
waters.
in
addition,
and
this
mr.
justice
powell
goes
to
i
guess
your
earlier
question,
in
addition
a
number
of
actions
both
criminal
and
civil
were
commenced
in
1968
and
in
1970,
a
large
number
of
actions
under
the
refuse
act
against
companies
that
were
discharging
non-impeding
industrial
waste
into
the
rivers.
in
fact,
as
early
as
1967
the
third
circuit,
the
same
court
that
rendered
the
decisions
below.
the
third
circuit
held
that
that
activity,
that’s
the
non-impeding
discharges
that
that
was
unlawful
in
or
like
steel
which
is
perhaps
the
case
most
often
cited
in
this
area
at
lower
federal
court
case
most
often
to
cite
in
this
area,
was
to
the
same
effect.
it
was
decided
in
1969,
and
indeed
there’s
no
court
decision
that
we’ve
been
able
to
find
prior
to
the
offenses
here
that
held
that
the
refuse
act
was
not,
was
limited
to,
just
to
discharges
that
impede
navigation.
in
short,
the
scope
of
the
criminal
prohibition
had
been
authoritatively
settled
well
before
picco
made
the
present
illegal
discharges
into
the
monongahela
river.
moreover,
the
corps
announced
in
the
summer
of
1970
sweeping
changes
in
its
regulations
pertaining
to
permits
for
work
in
navigable
waters.
we
have
set
forth
that
announcement
in
our
appendix
to
our
main
brief,
with
specific
reference
to
the
refuse
act,
it
also
announced
in
july
1970
and
this
announcement
is
in
both
our
main
brief
and
our
reply
brief,
but
there
is
a
misprint
in
the
main
brief
and
that’s
why
we
incorporated
it
in
our
reply
brief.
in
july
of
1970,
it
made
the
following
--
issued
the
following
announcement
and
let
me
just
read
quickly
the
first
paragraph
of
that.
it
says
“the
corps
of
engineers
today
announced
new
permit
requirements
under
the
refuse
act
concerning
all
discharges
into
navigable
waters.
permits
will
be
required
for
all
industrial
discharges
into
navigable
waters
and
their
tributaries.
new
permits
will
be
required
where
existing
permits
were
granted
without
adequate
consideration
of
the
quality
of
the
effluent.
permits
will
also
be
required
for
current
discharges
into
navigable
waters
where
no
permits
have
been
granted.”
now,
we
believe
that
it’s
clear
that
if
picco
had
made
even
the
most
superficial
inquiry
after
1968,
it
would
have
known
that
it
needed
a
permit
to
discharge
this
kind
of
industrial
waste
into
the
waterways.
it
made
no
such
inquiry,
and
we
think
that
without
such
an
inquiry
in
the
face
of
the
change
in
the
regulations,
the
clear
pronouncements
by
this
court
and
other
lower
courts,
and
the
clear
pronouncements
by
the
corps
of
engineers
that
it
cannot
now
be
seen
to
rely
on
the
defense
that
it
was
affirmatively
misled
into
believing
that
this
conduct
was
lawful
and
was
not
prohibited
by
the
act.
for
these
reasons
and
the
reasons
stated
in
our
main
brief
and
reply
brief,
we
submit
that
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
should
be
reversed
and
the
judgment
of
the
district
court
should
be
reinstated.
mr.
chief
justice,
if
i
have
any
time
remaining,
i’d
like
to
reserve
for
rebuttal.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
just
one
or
two
points
mr.
chief
justice.
i
think
that
with
--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
no,
your
honor,
that
--
this
case
was
exclusively
under
the
statute
and
the
public
nuisance
federal
law
was
not
involved
in
this
particular
case.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
conceivably,
i
think
that
--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
--
illinois
and
the
city
of
milwaukee
i
believe
this
court
indicated
that
under
the
--
there
is
a
federal
law
of
nuisance
which
conceivably
would
be
available,
but
this
was
an
action
brought
under
the
federal
statute
and
that
was
not
involved.
i
just
want
to
make
the
point
that
the
corps
of
engineers
after
1968,
after
this
court
decided
the
standard
oil
case
and
made
it
clear
that
the
refuse
act
applied
to
non-impeding
--
non-navigation
impeding
discharges
and
at
that
time
it
changed
its
attitude
with
respect
to
its
responsibilities,
this
1968
regulation
which
mr.
gondelman
showed
to
the
court
was
withdrawn.
it
instituted
new
regulations
which
put
--
whereby
everyone
was
put
on
notice
of
the
fact
that
the
corps
was
now
considering
pollution
matters,
conservation
matters
with
respect
to
applications
for
permission
to
use
navigable
waters
and
this
was
made
crystal
clear
with
respect
to
the
refuse
act
itself
and
the
notice
that
we
have
appended
to
the
reply
brief
in
july
of
1970
where
it
was
made
--
it
was
clear
that
there
was
a
permit
available
at
the
time
of
these
offenses
and
if
even
the
most
superficial
inquiry
had
been
made
by
the
company
of
the
corps,
assuming
that
they
had
some
doubt
as
to
whether
the
law
did
in
fact
apply
to
this
particular
discharge.
if
they
made
the
most
superficial
inquiry,
they
would
have
been
notified
at
that
time
that
there
was
in
fact
a
permit
available
and
one
that
they
should
have
gotten
before
making
these
discharges.
i
would
point
out
just
in
closing
that
in
fact
in
november
of
1970
which
is
after
the
time
of
these
offenses,
mr.
justice
blackmun,
the
dates
you
were
talking
about
earlier
that
in
november
of
1970
the
corps
explicitly
advised
this
company
that
their
discharges
from
this
plant
into
the
monongahela
river
was
in
violation
of
the
refuse
act
without
a
permit
and
they
would
need
a
permit
so
that
the
permit
--
the
permits
were
available
and
had
they
made
any
kind
of
inquiry,
they
could’ve
gotten
this
permit.
they
didn’t
and
in
the
absence
of
doing
so,
we
think
that
it
was
proper
to
--
the
conviction
was
proper
under
the
refuse
act.
thank
you.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
third
circuit.
to
review
that
court’s
judgment,
reversing
the
judgment
of
conviction
by
the
district
court
in
remanding
to
further
proceedings.
the
action
was
commenced
by
criminal
information
in
april
1971
against
respondent,
pennsylvania
industrial
chemical
corporation,
hereafter
referred
to
as
picco.
the
company
was
charged
in
four
counts
with
violating
section
13
of
the
rivers
and
harbors
act
of
1899,
the
so-called
refuse
act,
which
in
relevant
part
makes
it
unlawful
without
first
obtaining
permission
from
the
secretary
of
the
army
to
discharge
into
any
navigable
water
of
the
united
states.
“any
refuse
matter
of
any
kind
or
description
whatever,
other
than
that
flowing
from
streets
and
sewers
and
passing
therefrom
in
a
liquid
state.”
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
the
date
were
--
there
were
two
dates.
august
7
and
august
19,
1970.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
no,
your
honor,
i
don’t
know
why
they
--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
it
certainly
would’ve
made
a
much
different
--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
well,
at
least
nobody
apparently
was
sampling
the
discharges
on
the
monongahela
after
that
date,
but
the
date
of
the
offenses
though
were
august
7
and
august
19,
1970.
now,
the
discharges
involved
here
flowed
into
the
monongahela
river
admittedly
a
navigable
water
from
two
pipes
owned
by
picco
and
used
by
the
company
to
carry
off
treated
waste
matter
left
in
the
manufacture
of
chemical
compounds
used
in
industry.
one
of
the
pipes,
an
iron
pipe,
served
only
picco’s
plant.
the
other,
a
concrete
pipe,
served
the
plant
primarily,
but
was
also
used
by
six
private
residences
nearby
essentially
to
discard
used
laundry
water.
on
august
7
and
again
on
august
19,
1970,
the
discharges
from
the
two
pipes
were
sampled
by
private
citizens,
and
the
samples
were
turned
over
to
the
allegheny
county
bureau
of
test
for
chemical
analysis.
this
analysis
revealed
that
the
effluent
flowing
from
picco’s
pipe
contained
a
disproportionably
high
amount
of
aluminum,
some
iron,
chloride,
phosphate
and
other
chemicals
all
in
greater
amounts
than
were
found
in
the
midstream
waters
of
the
river,
and
an
unusually
high
quantity
of
suspended
solids.
at
trial,
picco
took
the
position
that
the
industrial
waste
it
was
discharging
into
the
monongahela
river
did
not
constitute
prohibited
refuse
matter
under
the
act.
first
it
argued
that
the
refuse
act
covers
only
river
deposits
that
impede
navigation,
not
non-impeding
liquid
solutions
of
the
sort
involved
here.
in
the
alternative
it
urged
that
the
discharge
from
its
plant
was
nothing
more
than
sewage,
and
thus
came
within
the
explicit
statutory
exception.
both
of
these
contentions
were
rejected
by
the
district
court.
they
were
renewed
in
the
court
of
appeals
and
also
rejected.
no
cross
petition
was
filed
by
respondent
in
this
court
seeking
further
review
of
those
rulings.
and
thus
the
application
of
the
refuse
act
to
discharges
of
the
type
involved
in
this
case
is
not
at
issue
here,
because
the
judgment
under
review
is
based
on
the
premise
that
the
act
apply
to
these
discharges.
rather,
the
issues
before
the
court
relate
essentially
to
the
second
proviso
in
the
act
which
provides
that
the
secretary
of
the
army
“may
permit”
the
deposit
of
otherwise
prohibited
material
in
navigable
waters
if
navigation
will
not
be
adversely
affected
thereby,
provided
that
application
is
made
to
the
secretary
prior
to
depositing
such
material.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
i’m
suggesting
that
that
is
irrelevant
for
purposes
of
this
case.
we
don’t
know
it
but
whether
they
would
or
would
not
satisfy
state
water
quality
standards,
i
say
is
not
relevant
for
--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
the
1967
state
quality
standards
for
the
commonwealth
of
pennsylvania
had
been
approved.
the
records
--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
assume
that
i
still
think
--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
it
would
have
significance,
your
honor,
to
the
extent
that
the
plant
sought
permission
from
the
federal
government
also
to
discharge.
the
1970
water
pollution
statutes
require
that
the
in
order
to
get
permission
from
the
federal
government,
a
certification
has
to
be
presented
that
you
do
meet
state
quality
standards,
so
--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
for
discharging
without
getting
a
permit,
without
getting
a
federal
permit,
or
without
getting
any
permission
from
the
federal
government.
it
does
not
concern
whether
if
application
had
been
made,
this
plant
could
have
gotten
a
permit.
we
don’t
know
on
this
record
or
on
the
base
of
the
operative
proof
whether
they
even
had
a
state
permit
that
the
state
certification
that
they
met
the
1967
standards.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
that’s
right,
but
it’s
irrelevant
because
they
never,
in
any
event,
they
never
presented
that
certification,
even
if
they
did
have
it
to
the
federal
government,
and
therefore,
sought
a
federal
permit.
it’s
irrelevant
if
they
just
hold
it
and
keep
it
in
their
office
which
will
be
all
that
they
offer
proof
in
any
event
would’ve
shown
had
it
incorporated
such
a
permit.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
well,
your
honor,
i
think
it’s
relatively
insignificant
for
the
future.
it
does
have
significance
with
respect
to
the
pending
criminal
and
civil
--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
there
are
now
115.
i
believe
115
pending
criminal
actions
and
70
pending
civil
injunctive
suits
under
the
act,
but
the
1972
water
pollution
control
act
which
does
require
setup
statutory
permit
program
and
provides
a
moratorium
in
essence
on
refuse
act
prosecutions
until
after
implementation
of
that
permit
plan
really
makes
this
particular
case
insignificant
in
the
future.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
people
will
still
have
to
get
a
permit,
but
--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
that’s
correct
your
honor,
but
i
believe
they
will
be
criminally
prosecuted
under
another
statute.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
i
believe
it
would
not
be
under
this
statute
it
would
rather
be
under
the
new
1972
water
pollution
control
act
amendment.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
well,
that
act
has
transferred
the
permit
authority
that
was
vested
under
this
act
and
the
secretary
has
transferred
it
to
the
environmental
protection
agency,
and
it
requires
now
that
you
get
your
permit
from
that
agency
and
i
think
that
--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
well,
i
believe
that
the
refuse
act
that
the
prosecution
will
proceed.
there
are
criminal
penalties
now
under
the
1972
act.
i
think
that
the
refuse
act
could
well
still
be
viable
for
non-point
source
emissions
because
the
1972
act
really
pertains
to
point
source
that
is
emissions
coming
from
pipes
directly
into
the
river.
where
your
refuse
act
prosecutions
in
the
future
rely
is
essentially
with
respect
to
matter
that’s
placed
on
the
bank
where
--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
or
that
type
of
situation.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
or
an
accident,
that’s
correct.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
well
--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
i
don’t
--
i
think
that
before
1968
your
honor,
that
there
were
relatively
few
prosecutions
brought.
that
in
1968
i
believe
that
there
were
something
like
30
or
40,
and
then
in
1969
that
is
when
the
government
really
began
to
use
this
particular
statute
to
reach
the
activity
that
we’re
talking
about
in
this
case,
so
that
most
of
the
prosecutions
that
are
set
forth
in
that
footnote
were
prosecutions
that
they
were
commenced
in
1960,
perhaps
late
‘68,
but
generally
1969,
‘70
and
‘71.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
that’s
right.
that
is
not
a
--
that
case,
in
fact
those
two
cases
do
not
involve
the
refuse
act.
they
involve
statutes
requiring
plumbers
to
get
a
license
before
they
could
operate
in
the
state
of
texas.
there
were
more
than
one
criminal
prosecution.
there
was
more
than
one
prosecution
under
this
act
before
this
particular
action
was
brought.
there
was
the
la
merced
case
in
1936.
there
were
a
couple
of
cases
prior
to
that.
there
was
the
ballard
oil
case,
of
course
we
have
the
two
cases
that
were
in
this
court,
republic
steel
and
standard
oil.
there
was
--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
the
standard
oil
case
was
a
criminal
case.
the
republic
steel
case
was
not.
there
was
a
decision
in
the
third
circuit
and
there
were
a
number
of
others.
so
it
was
certainly
more
than
one.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
that’s
correct,
yes
your
honor.
let
me
look
just
briefly
to
the
language
of
the
refuse
act
and
this
second
proviso.
the
act
itself
speaks
in
broad
terms.
it
bans
all
discharges
of
refuse
matter
into
navigable
rivers,
or
into
navigable
waters
except
sewage.
but
under
the
second
proviso,
the
secretary
of
the
army
“may
permit”
certain
forbidden
discharges
“provided
application
is
made
to
him
prior
to
depositing
such
material.”
now,
this
proviso
does
not
speak
in
terms
of
the
formal
regulatory
program.
what
congress
did
in
1899
was
to
vest
in
the
secretary
discretionary
authority,
in
those
instances
where
a
prior
application
is
made,
discretionary
authority
to
immunize
from
criminal
prosecution
discharges
that
would
otherwise
being
unlawful.
how,
when
and
in
what
circumstances
he
might
exercise
that
authority
were
left
to
him.
in
this
regard,
the
1899
refuse
act
was
no
different
from
the
predecessor
statutes
on
which
it
was
based,
neither
the
act
of
1890
nor
the
act
of
1894,
both
of
which
imposed
a
flat
ban
on
the
discharge
of
enumerated
substances
in
the
navigable
waters.
neither
of
those
statutes
called
for
the
establishment
of
a
formal
regulatory
program
under
which
permission
to
discharge
would
be
given.
instead,
the
decision
whether
to
permit
a
forbidden
discharge
was
left
in
those
earlier
statutes
to
the
discretion
of
the
secretary
of
war,
he
could
act
or
not
as
he
saw
fit
to
accept
particular
discharges
from
the
general
statutory
prohibition.
and
this
we
think
is
what
congress
intended
by
the
second
proviso
in
the
refuse
act.
if
the
secretary
wish
to
establish
a
formal
regulatory
program,
it
certainly
was
within
his
authority
to
do
so
under
this
proviso,
but
for
some
70
years,
he
chose
not
to
operate
on
that
basis,
rather
he
chose
to
act
informally
passing
on
applications
only
when
and
as
submitted.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
i
believe
that
if
congress
had
contemplated
that
and
it
contemplated
that
the
violation
of
the
statute
turned
on
compliance
with
that
program,
it
would
make
a
difference,
your
honor.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
i
thought
you
meant
if
the
language
had
required,
the
statute
required.
no,
i
think
it
would
not
make
any
difference
under
this
language
that
whether
there
was
a
program
set
out,
form
a
program
set
up
or
not
would
make
no
difference.
i
think
what
the
proviso
does
is
it
provides
a
limited
defense
to
a
refuse
act
prosecution
for
discharges
which
the
secretary
in
his
discretion
may
permit.
now,
under
the
court
of
appeals
decision
that
limited
defense
based
on
affirmative
action
taken
by
the
secretary
is
converted
to
an
absolute
defense
through
a
formal
permit
--
because
the
secretary
fails
to
exercise
his
discretion
through
a
formal
permit
program,
what
the
court
of
appeals
decision
does
is
turn
the
statute
on
its
head.
that
which
congress
in
1899
declared
to
be
generally
prohibited
that
is
the
continuous
discharge
of
industrial
waste
into
our
nation’s
waters
becomes
generally
permissible
in
the
absence
of
a
formal
regulatory
scheme
which
congress
did
not
prescribe.
now,
apparently
the
court
of
appeals
reached
this
result,
not
so
much
on
the
basis
of
the
language
or
the
history
of
the
refuse
act,
but
rather
on
the
basis
of
its
reading
of
later
congressional
enactments
in
the
water
quality
field,
particularly
the
water
pollution
control
act
of
1948
as
amended
through
1970
but
not
the
1972
amendments
which
have
alluded
to
and
which
were
enacted
after
this
decision.
but
this
water
quality
legislation,
the
court
of
appeals
suggest
can’t
be
reconciled
with
the
1899
prohibition,
unless
we
read
enforcement
of
that
prohibition
is
turning
on
the
existence
of
a
formal
regulatory
program.
i
might
just
interject
that
this
problem
of
reconciliation,
whatever
it
might
be
has
been
in
large
part
resolved
by
the
1972
amendments
where
congress
itself
incorporated
the
two
acts
in
essence
and
certainly
reconciled
them
in
that
legislation.
but
before
that
in
the
earlier
water
quality
legislation,
congress
provided
explicitly
that
that
water
quality
legislation
was
not
to
be
construed
as
impairing
or
affecting
the
prohibition
of
the
refuse
act.
moreover,
the
water
quality
legislation
and
the
refuse
act
don’t
across
purposes
as
the
court
of
appeals
seemed
to
suggest.
both
arraigned
that
the
same
end,
the
cleaning
up
the
nation’s
waters,
but
they
used
different
means
to
do
it.
now,
we’ve
spelled
out
in
our
brief
the
structure
of
the
water
pollution
control
act.
essentially
that
legislation
contemplates
a
cooperative
effort
by
the
states
and
the
federal
government
in
establishing
and
enforcing
water
quality
standards.
but
prior
to
1972,
that
is
the
new
amendment
in
1972
to
this
water
quality
legislation,
prior
to
that
time
the
water
quality
legislation
contained
no
penalty
provisions.
discharges
which
reduced
the
quality
of
the
receiving
body
of
water
below
the
set
standards
was
subject
only
to
lengthy
proceedings
which
could
possibly
ended
in
a
abatement
order.
thus,
the
refuse
act
which
was
saved
by
congress,
the
refuse
act
of
1899
essentially
provided
the
teeth
to
the
clean
water
program.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
we
don’t
know,
it
just
can’t
be
determined
your
honor
on
this
record
or
on
the
base
of
the
offers
of
proof.
we
have
a
permit
that’s
in
the
appendix
i
believe
the
respondent’s
brief,
state
permit
issued
in
1956
which
permitted
the
construction
of
the
plant
and
discharge
at
that
time.
the
state
of
pennsylvania’s
water
quality
standards
were
approved
in
1967
by
the
federal
government
and
there’s
no
indication
that
the
company
has
gotten
a
permit
--
a
certification
from
the
state
that
it
was
inline
with
the
1967
water
quality
standards,
but
--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
well,
i
think
that
would
be
first
inquiry
to
be
made
on
submission
of
an
application
to
the
federal
government
for
a
permit,
but
the
point
that
we’re
making
in
this
case
is
that
the
refuse
act
precludes
those
discharges
which
fail
to
meet
the
water
quality
standards,
and
also
even
those
that
arguably
do
meet
them
until
you
first
go
to
the
federal
government
and
get
permission.
now,
the
1970
water
quality
legislation
that’s
the
earlier
amendments
required
that
these
companies
submit
to
the
federal
government
certification
that
it
met
the
water
quality
standards
in
its
efforts
to
obtain
a
permit.
and
the
refuse
act
would
--
it
would
be
no
violation
if
they’d
gone
to
the
federal
government
and
they’d
submitted
a
certification
that
they
did
in
fact
comply
and
then
they’d
been
permitted
by
the
federal
government
to
discharge.
but
in
this
case,
we
don’t
have
any
inquiry
made
by
the
company
whatsoever
to
the
federal
government
with
respect
to
a
permit
for
these
particular
discharges.
now,
the
company’s
argument
is
that
they
were
affirmatively
misled
by
the
corps
of
engineers
into
believing
that
a
permit
wasn’t
required
in
this
situation
since
its
discharges
did
not
impede
navigation.
and
principal
reliance
with
this
argument
is
placed
on
the
corps
of
engineers
early
regulations,
which
in
1968
or
until
1968
indicated
that
the
corps
reviewed
its
responsibility
under
the
refuse
act
as
i
am
quoting
from
those
1968
regulations,
as
“directed
principally
against
the
discharges
of
those
materials
that
are
obstructive
or
injurious
to
navigation.”
now,
in
view
of
these
earlier
regulations
and
the
fact
that
there
were
many
industrial
plants
up
and
down
the
river
that
were
discharging
industrial
waste
in
the
same
manner,
picco
argues
that
it
could
properly
assume,
and
i
use
that
word
advisably,
it
did
not
go
to
the
corps
of
engineers
and
asked
about
these
discharges,
it
didn’t
make
any
inquiry.
it
says
that
it
could
properly
assume
that
it
needed
no
federal
authorization
for
its
non-impeding
discharge.
well,
i
think
this
court
in
1966
made
it
clear
in
the
standard
oil
case
that
the
refuse
act
proscribes
discharges
of
refuse
matter
having
no
adverse
effect
on
navigation
to
the
same
extent
as
it
prescribes
those
discharges
that
in
fact
impede
navigation.
and
the
fact
that
the
1899
statute
had
not
for
many
years
been
enforced
as
vigorously
with
respect
to
the
non-impeding
discharges
cannot
be
held
to
diminish
its
force
today.
we
think
the
essential
point
here
is
that
following
the
standard
oil
decision,
the
corps
of
engineers
changed
its
view
of
its
responsibilities
under
the
refuse
act
with
the
respect
to
administering
activities
in
navigable
waterways.
and
as
we
spelled
out
in
our
brief,
the
regulations
issued
--
no,
the
regulations
on
which
picco
relies
were
withdrawn
in
1968.
new
regulations
were
issued
by
the
corps
and
they
were
published
in
the
federal
register,
and
they
served
notice
that
the
corps
will
consider
pollution
and
conservation
factors
in
passing
on
applications
for
permission
to
use
navigable
waters.
in
addition,
and
this
mr.
justice
powell
goes
to
i
guess
your
earlier
question,
in
addition
a
number
of
actions
both
criminal
and
civil
were
commenced
in
1968
and
in
1970,
a
large
number
of
actions
under
the
refuse
act
against
companies
that
were
discharging
non-impeding
industrial
waste
into
the
rivers.
in
fact,
as
early
as
1967
the
third
circuit,
the
same
court
that
rendered
the
decisions
below.
the
third
circuit
held
that
that
activity,
that’s
the
non-impeding
discharges
that
that
was
unlawful
in
or
like
steel
which
is
perhaps
the
case
most
often
cited
in
this
area
at
lower
federal
court
case
most
often
to
cite
in
this
area,
was
to
the
same
effect.
it
was
decided
in
1969,
and
indeed
there’s
no
court
decision
that
we’ve
been
able
to
find
prior
to
the
offenses
here
that
held
that
the
refuse
act
was
not,
was
limited
to,
just
to
discharges
that
impede
navigation.
in
short,
the
scope
of
the
criminal
prohibition
had
been
authoritatively
settled
well
before
picco
made
the
present
illegal
discharges
into
the
monongahela
river.
moreover,
the
corps
announced
in
the
summer
of
1970
sweeping
changes
in
its
regulations
pertaining
to
permits
for
work
in
navigable
waters.
we
have
set
forth
that
announcement
in
our
appendix
to
our
main
brief,
with
specific
reference
to
the
refuse
act,
it
also
announced
in
july
1970
and
this
announcement
is
in
both
our
main
brief
and
our
reply
brief,
but
there
is
a
misprint
in
the
main
brief
and
that’s
why
we
incorporated
it
in
our
reply
brief.
in
july
of
1970,
it
made
the
following
--
issued
the
following
announcement
and
let
me
just
read
quickly
the
first
paragraph
of
that.
it
says
“the
corps
of
engineers
today
announced
new
permit
requirements
under
the
refuse
act
concerning
all
discharges
into
navigable
waters.
permits
will
be
required
for
all
industrial
discharges
into
navigable
waters
and
their
tributaries.
new
permits
will
be
required
where
existing
permits
were
granted
without
adequate
consideration
of
the
quality
of
the
effluent.
permits
will
also
be
required
for
current
discharges
into
navigable
waters
where
no
permits
have
been
granted.”
now,
we
believe
that
it’s
clear
that
if
picco
had
made
even
the
most
superficial
inquiry
after
1968,
it
would
have
known
that
it
needed
a
permit
to
discharge
this
kind
of
industrial
waste
into
the
waterways.
it
made
no
such
inquiry,
and
we
think
that
without
such
an
inquiry
in
the
face
of
the
change
in
the
regulations,
the
clear
pronouncements
by
this
court
and
other
lower
courts,
and
the
clear
pronouncements
by
the
corps
of
engineers
that
it
cannot
now
be
seen
to
rely
on
the
defense
that
it
was
affirmatively
misled
into
believing
that
this
conduct
was
lawful
and
was
not
prohibited
by
the
act.
for
these
reasons
and
the
reasons
stated
in
our
main
brief
and
reply
brief,
we
submit
that
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
should
be
reversed
and
the
judgment
of
the
district
court
should
be
reinstated.
mr.
chief
justice,
if
i
have
any
time
remaining,
i’d
like
to
reserve
for
rebuttal.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
just
one
or
two
points
mr.
chief
justice.
i
think
that
with
--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
no,
your
honor,
that
--
this
case
was
exclusively
under
the
statute
and
the
public
nuisance
federal
law
was
not
involved
in
this
particular
case.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
conceivably,
i
think
that
--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
--
illinois
and
the
city
of
milwaukee
i
believe
this
court
indicated
that
under
the
--
there
is
a
federal
law
of
nuisance
which
conceivably
would
be
available,
but
this
was
an
action
brought
under
the
federal
statute
and
that
was
not
involved.
i
just
want
to
make
the
point
that
the
corps
of
engineers
after
1968,
after
this
court
decided
the
standard
oil
case
and
made
it
clear
that
the
refuse
act
applied
to
non-impeding
--
non-navigation
impeding
discharges
and
at
that
time
it
changed
its
attitude
with
respect
to
its
responsibilities,
this
1968
regulation
which
mr.
gondelman
showed
to
the
court
was
withdrawn.
it
instituted
new
regulations
which
put
--
whereby
everyone
was
put
on
notice
of
the
fact
that
the
corps
was
now
considering
pollution
matters,
conservation
matters
with
respect
to
applications
for
permission
to
use
navigable
waters
and
this
was
made
crystal
clear
with
respect
to
the
refuse
act
itself
and
the
notice
that
we
have
appended
to
the
reply
brief
in
july
of
1970
where
it
was
made
--
it
was
clear
that
there
was
a
permit
available
at
the
time
of
these
offenses
and
if
even
the
most
superficial
inquiry
had
been
made
by
the
company
of
the
corps,
assuming
that
they
had
some
doubt
as
to
whether
the
law
did
in
fact
apply
to
this
particular
discharge.
if
they
made
the
most
superficial
inquiry,
they
would
have
been
notified
at
that
time
that
there
was
in
fact
a
permit
available
and
one
that
they
should
have
gotten
before
making
these
discharges.
i
would
point
out
just
in
closing
that
in
fact
in
november
of
1970
which
is
after
the
time
of
these
offenses,
mr.
justice
blackmun,
the
dates
you
were
talking
about
earlier
that
in
november
of
1970
the
corps
explicitly
advised
this
company
that
their
discharges
from
this
plant
into
the
monongahela
river
was
in
violation
of
the
refuse
act
without
a
permit
and
they
would
need
a
permit
so
that
the
permit
--
the
permits
were
available
and
had
they
made
any
kind
of
inquiry,
they
could’ve
gotten
this
permit.
they
didn’t
and
in
the
absence
of
doing
so,
we
think
that
it
was
proper
to
--
the
conviction
was
proper
under
the
refuse
act.
thank
you.
