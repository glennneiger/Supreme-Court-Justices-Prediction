justice
potter
stewart
that’s
a
texas
case,
and
it
says
tax
criminal.
i
think
it
means
it
is
a
texas
case
and
it
involves
i
think
the
principle
that
the
court’s
talking
about
there.
justice
potter
stewart
these
two
cases
cited
in
footnote
8
of
the
court’s
opinion
have
to
do
with
the
principle
of
imposing
criminal
penalties
for
people
who
fairly
comply
with
a
non-existent
regulatory
program
--
as
i
understand
it?
justice
potter
stewart
were
this
just
discharge
have
violated
the
water
quality
legislation?
justice
potter
stewart
if
it
is
your
submission
that
the
refuse
act
did
no
more
than
provide
the
teeth
for
enforcement
of
the
water
quality
standards
act,
i
should
suppose
the
first
inquiry
in
this
case,
if
you’re
right,
would
be
whether
or
not
this
discharge
violated
the
water
quality
legislation,
wouldn’t
it?
justice
potter
stewart
and
what
was
the
date
of
that?
justice
potter
stewart
did
you
just
say
mr.
gondelman
that
you
offered
these
regulations
and
in
evidence
at
the
trial?
justice
potter
stewart
isn’t
that
kind
of
an
unusual
thing
to
do?
i
can
imagine
the
regulations
might
have
a
bearing
on
the
judge’s
determination
of
the
legal
point,
but
ordinarily
you
wouldn’t
offer
them
for
use
of
the
jury.
