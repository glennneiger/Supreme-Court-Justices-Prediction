mr.
charles
w.
grubb
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
am
here
under
rather
ominous
position
today,
faithfully
speaking
in
that
when
the
travel
act,
section
1952
of
title
18
of
united
states
code
was
passed
in
1961,
i
was
a
special
agent
of
the
federal
bureau
of
investigation
assigned
to
lake
county,
indiana,
and
i
had
prepared
that
time
the
first
summary
report
to
be
used
for
the
prosecution
of
people
like
i
am
representing
today.
this
act
is
the
travel
act,
section
1952
of
title
18
of
the
united
states
code.
now
the
question
before
this
court
today
is
whether
the
seventh
circuit
erred
in
not
following
the
case
of
u.s.
versus
arnold,
which
was
cited
in
the
briefs,
treated
in
the
briefs.
in
that
case
they
had
treated
also
section
1953,
which
was
a
companion
section
of
section
1952,
which
is
the
travel
act.
the
court
of
appeals,
seventh
court
of
appeals,
stated
and
rejected
arnold
on
the
ground
that
there
was
lack
of
precedent
and
also
that
there
was
a
lack
of
reasoning
in
the
case.
well,
this
was
actually
a
case
of
first
impression
for
all
practical
purposes
and,
thus,
there
was
a
lack
of
precedent
for
it.
but
i
believe
that
the
study
of
the
legislating
history,
study
of
the
acts
themselves,
and
the
study
of
the
cases
cited
by
the
government
and
the
cases
which
i
shall
cite,
support
arnold
and
give
reasoning,
arnold
was
first.
there
is
no
doubt
about
it,
it
was
the
first
opinion,
but
nevertheless
i
think
that
we
have
a
proper
reason
that
can
be
found
in
these
cases
and
also
in
the
statutes.
now
petitioners
were
convicted
under
section
1952,
the
travel
act.
they
were
horse
race
bookies
and
they
use
what
is
known
as
the
illinois
sports
news,
i
don’t
believe
if
we
got
this
in
the
record
pointed
out,
but
this
was
the
illinois
sports
news.
it’s
a
newspaper
published
in
chicago,
illinois
and
is
used
by
bookies,
because
it
contains
horse
race
betting
information
and
predictions.
this
paper
was
sent
to
the
petitioners
who
all
reside
in
lake
county,
indiana
and
so
that
--
some
of
them
were
my
informers
when
i
was
in
the
fbi.
these
persons
used
this,
this
paper
was
sent
from
chicago,
illinois
to
hammond,
indiana
and
it
was
consigned
to
what
was
known
as
the
hammond
news
agency.
these
petitioners
according
to
the
record
went
to
the
railroad
station
and
picked
up
the
copies
of
it
dropping,
leaving
their
money
there
and
took
the
copies
and
they
did
use
it
in
their
horse
racing
operations.
the
illinois
sport
news
has
been
held
to
be
a
newspaper
and
exempt
under
section
1953
of
title
18,
which
is
the
companion
section,
and
it
was
so
held
by
the
seventh
circuit
which
treated
this
case
previously
and
that
was
in
kelly
versus
illinois
bell
telephone
company,
that's
a
1963
case.
i
am
giving
the
citation
because
there
were
two
kelly
cases
that
i
have
in
the
briefs,
325
f.
2nd.
148
and
it
was
held
in
a
general
way
by
the
seventh
circuit,
to
be
a
newspaper
and
exempt
from
the
operation
of
section
1953.
now,
congress
had
a
right
--
had
a
reason
to
exempt
newspapers
from
section
1953
and
that's
to
protect
the
right
for
free
press.
but
in
passing
1953,
it
permitted
the
interstate
transportation
of
a
paper
carrying
with
it
information,
carrying
with
it
gambling
information,
betting
information.
this
information
could
be
used
for
only
one
purpose,
none
but
or
so
a
nothing
else.
it's
worth
for
anything
for
anything
else
except
gambling,
it’s
a
betting
paper,
but
congress
permitted
this
to
be
passed
and
they
knew
it
couldn’t
be
passed
and
in
doing
so
they
knew
it,
it
would
be
transported
for
one
purpose
and
that
is
to
use
for
gambling
purpose.
this
is
not
going
to
be
used
to
paper
walls,
it's
not
going
to
be
use
line
bureau
drawers.
it's
strictly
a
gambling
paper
and
government
made
that
quite
plain
in
the
various
trials
that
we
had.
now,
the
cases
cited
by
the
government
in
opposition
can
be
distinguished
from
the
cases
before
the
court,
and
also
from
arnold,
in
fact,
i
think
they
help
to
explain
arnold.
u.s.
versus
miller
which
is
cited
in
the
brief,
that's
a
1967
case
out
of
seventh
circuit,
once
all
this
began.
the
defendants
there
subscribed
to
western
union
service,
the
defendants
had
a
ticker,
they
paid
for
it,
they
have
it
in
their
gambling
joint
wherever
it
was
in
lake
county,
indiana
and
they
used
the
information
from
that.
they
caused,
they
did
not
cause
the
interstate
commerce
or
cause
the
use
of
an
interstate
facility.
they
used
it,
they
actually
used
it,
and
the
case
before
the
court
that
these
petitioners
did
not
subscribe
to
any
paper,
they
did
not
order
any
paper.
they
did
not
cause
any
direct
use
of
interstate
commerce.
the
next
case
is
u.s.
versus
azar,
which
is
a
1964
case,
it’s
a
district
court
case
in
michigan.
there
we
had
another
paper
much
like
the
illinois
sport
news,
it’s
called
the
green
sheet
and
the
green
sheet
was
published
in
ohio.
the
two
defendants
in
azar
traveled
from
detroit,
michigan
to
ohio
where
the
paper
is
published,
and
there
they
gave
information,
which
was
used
in
the
paper,
actually
used
in
the
paper,
and
then
the
paper
was
sent
across
states
lines
back
into
michigan
and
there
the
defendants
as
consignees
picked
up
the
paper,
they
--
the
paper
was
sent
to
them.
they
used
interstate
commerce,
they
caused
its
use
by
being
consignees
and
they
also
traveled
across
the
state
line
to
add,
to
give
information
for
publication.
it
was
direct
travel
in
interstate
commerce,
we
did
not
have
it
in
the
case
at
bar.
the
next
case
was
u.s.
versus
ross,
a
1967
case
and
it
was
in
the
sixth
circuit.
the
defendant
was
a
subscriber
to
what
is
known
as
the
angel-kaplan
sports
publications.
now
this
is
similar
to
the
illinois
sport
news
i
assume.
now
this
was
shipped
in
interstate
commerce
to
the
defendant
in
tennessee.
the
defendant
admitted
in
this
case
that
he
was
a
subscriber,
he
was
a
subscriber
to
this
paper.
it
was
sent
to
him
directly
and
he
in
effect
caused
the
use
of
interstate
commerce
which
was
not
true
of
the
defendants
--
petitioners
in
our
case.
and
the
last
case
with
the
government
cited
was
us
versus
mendonez
(ph)
a
1968
case
out
of
the
circuit
court
of
--
out
of
fifth
circuit
court
of
the
appeals.
the
defendants
in
florida
used
the
telephone
to
new
york
to
get
the
total
liabilities
of
the
12
federal
reserve
banks
and
the
12
–
the
total
was
to
be
used
that
as
the
winning
number
in
their
lottery
game
here
again.
they
used
a
directly
interstate
commerce,
an
interstate
facility
which
is
not
true
of
our
defendants
--
of
our
petitioners.
now
the
seventh
circuit,
back
to
the
seventh
circuit
in
united
states
v.
mccormick,
a
1971
case
442
f2nd
316.
the
court
spoke
differently
on
the
use
of
interstate
facility
then
in
the
cases
before
this
court,
spoke
entirely
differently
and
i
want
to
bring
these
cases
these
two
cases
to
the
court's
attention.
the
court
there
--
the
defendant
mccormick,
the
man
in
indianapolis,
he
advertised
in
the
daily
newspaper
–
in
a
weekly
newspaper
for
salesmen
to
be
used
in
his
gambling
scheme,
in
his
lottery
scheme
and
these
salesman,
this
paper
went
across
the
states
lines
or
sent
through
mails
not
only
through
mails
but
it
was
sent
indiana
interstate
commerce.
and
the
government
urge
that
this
was
a
sufficient
use
of
interstate
--
of
an
interstate
facility.
the
seventh
circuit
reverse
this
and
said
and
i
would
like
to
read
this,
just
the
part
of
this
decision.
the
u.s.
versus
mccormick
and
they
start
out.
mr.
charles
w.
grubb
oh!
thank
you,
thank
you.
[luncheon
break]
mr.
charles
w.
grubb
thank
you,
your
honor.
i
was
about
to
read
from
u.s.
versus
mccormick,
that
is
a
case
of
in
all
the
seventh
circuit
court
and
i
am
reading
here
from
mccormick.
in
rewis
versus
us
401
u.s
and
i
will
give
the
correct
citation,
they
did
not
have
it
here,
it
is
28
led
2nd
493,
the
supreme
court
reverse
the
conviction
of
a
gambler
whose
lottery
operation
was
frequented
by
our
state
letters.
construing
this
same
section,
the
court
emphasized
the
intent
of
congress
to
strike
at
the
truly
interstate
operations
of
organized
crime.
the
court
refused
to
give
broad
ranging
application
to
the
statute,
particularly
since
congress
gave
no
indication
that
it
wished
to
alter
the
sensitive
federal
state
relationships,
over
extend
limited
federal
police
resources
or
produce
situations
in
which
the
geographic
origins
of
customers
a
matters
of
happen
stats
would
transform
relatively
minor
state
offenses
into
federal
felonies.
similarly
and
i
still
reading
from
mccormick,
similarly
in
u.s.
versus
altobella,
442
f
2nd
310
also
in
the
seventh
circuit.
this
court
struck
down
the
conviction
of
two
extortioners
under
the
section
1952
where
jurisdiction
was
claimed
on
the
basis
that
the
victims'
check
was
cleared
by
mail
between
chicago
and
philadelphia
stated,
“when
both
use
of
the
interstate
facility
and
the
subsequent
act
is
as
minimal
and
incidental
as
in
this
case,
we
do
not
believe
a
federal
crime
has
been
committed.”
the
court
then
reversed
and
added
in
mccormick,
“defendant
neither
used
nor
caused
to
be
used
and
the
interstate
facility
as
an
instrumental
part
of
his
illegal
operations.
we
must
therefore
conclude
that
no
federal
prime
was
committed
and
that
the
state
of
indiana
is
the
only
appropriate
authority
to
punish
the
defendant
for
maintaining
this
local
lottery.
mr.
charles
w.
grubb
yes
sir.
mr.
charles
w.
grubb
no
--
mr.
charles
w.
grubb
yes.
the
mccormick
is
–
the
rewis,
i
mean,
altobella
is
in
442
f2nd
310
and
mccormick
is
a
1971
case
it
is
also
in
442
f2nd
316.
mr.
charles
w.
grubb
now
in
mccormick
the
seventh
circuit
--
mr.
charles
w.
grubb
rewis.
mr.
charles
w.
grubb
yes
rewis,
i
am
going
to
go
--
mr.
charles
w.
grubb
yes
it
is
in
401
that
is
right,
i
did
not
have
the
u.s.
citation
i
have
the
supreme
court
citation,
the
supreme
court
reporter
and
led.
now
in
mccormick
the
seventh
circuit
that
held
transportation
of
in
newspaper
information
is
not
a
sufficient
use
of
interstate
facility
to
sustain
a
conviction,
also
in
altobella,
cited
in
mccormick,
the
court
held
at
the
clearance
of
a
check
through
the
mail
in
interstate
commerce
is
insufficient,
is
an
insufficient
use
of
an
interstate
facility
although
the
courts
have
held
for
years
that
under
section
2314
which
is
the
interstate
transportation
of
stolen
property
act,
under
section
2314
of
title
18
that
a
clearance
of
a
check
does
give
jurisdiction,
but
altobella
said
no.
it
is
difficult
for
me
to
reconcile
these
case
with
the
case
at
bar
and
also
with
arnold,
the
reasoning
that
the
court
did
give
and
these
cases
were
cited
before
the
seventh
circuit
when
i
argued
it
there.
now,
although
the
court
in
arnold
did
not
exhaustively
explain
its
opinion.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
cases
which
is
cited
by
the
government,
in
the
legislative
history
here
and
the
cases
cited
by
the
petitioner
of
all
give
some
reasoning
to
arnold
and
i
think
that
arnold
in
all
its
simplicity
should
be
followed,
but
back
to
rewis.
this
court
made
it
plain
that
the
travel
act
is
to
be
applied
to
truly
interstate
operations
of
organized
crime
and
the
seventh
circuit
so
read
that
in
the
rewis
decision
when
it
handed
down
the
mccormick
decision.
now
the
court
in
rewis,
i'll
only
read
one
short
excerpt
in
rewis.
mr.
charles
w.
grubb
yes
rewis
it
is
a
--
i
have
the
supreme
court
reporter
citation
here.
it
is
a
401,
it
is
--
this
is
what
was
stated
in
rewis,
“legislative
history
of
the
act
was
limited
but
does
review
that
1952
was
aimed
primarily
and
organized
crime
and
more
specifically
at
persons
who
reside
in
one
state
while
operating
or
managing
illegal
activities
located
in
another.
in
addition,
we
are
struck
by
what
congress
did
not
say,
and
court
further
said
in
rewis
that
matters
of
happen
stance
should
not
transform
relatively
minor
state
offenses
into
federal
felonies.
in
conclusion
i
like
to
state
that
here
there
was
no
organized
crime
ever
met,
no
evidence
of
any
organized
crime.
these
petitioners
were
all
independent
operators
or
they
were
employees
of
independent
operators.
they
never
ordered
nor
subscribed
to
the
illinois
sport
news.
they
merely,
they
did
not
use
the
chicago
south
shore
and
south
bend
railroad
commonly
known
as
south
shore
railroad
the
did
not
used
that
railroad.
they
picked
up
the
papers
there
but
they
were
consigned
to
the
hammond
news
agency,
just
to
same
as
many
of
us
do
in
the
morning
to
get
our
morning
paper
when
the
drug
stores
close
and
we
got
there
and
we
want
to
get
our
paper
for
we
got
on
the
computer,
train
we
pick
out
a
newspaper
out
of
bundle
and
leave
our
money
for
it
and
go
on
our
way.
mr.
charles
w.
grubb
that
is
right.
mr.
charles
w.
grubb
that
is
right
and
i
think
that
these
--
section
1953,
be
the
latest
in
the
statute
should
control,
i
believe
does
control
that
the
two
seconds
must
be
construed
impaired
material
and
i
cited
the
what
i
think
is
a
leading
case
on
that
and
i
believe
that
altered
them
section
1952
to
the
extent
it
was
not
to
be
--
that
it
was
a
exempt
for
use.
thank
you.
mr.
charles
w.
grubb
i
have
no
further,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
w.
grubb
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
am
here
under
rather
ominous
position
today,
faithfully
speaking
in
that
when
the
travel
act,
section
1952
of
title
18
of
united
states
code
was
passed
in
1961,
i
was
a
special
agent
of
the
federal
bureau
of
investigation
assigned
to
lake
county,
indiana,
and
i
had
prepared
that
time
the
first
summary
report
to
be
used
for
the
prosecution
of
people
like
i
am
representing
today.
this
act
is
the
travel
act,
section
1952
of
title
18
of
the
united
states
code.
now
the
question
before
this
court
today
is
whether
the
seventh
circuit
erred
in
not
following
the
case
of
u.s.
versus
arnold,
which
was
cited
in
the
briefs,
treated
in
the
briefs.
in
that
case
they
had
treated
also
section
1953,
which
was
a
companion
section
of
section
1952,
which
is
the
travel
act.
the
court
of
appeals,
seventh
court
of
appeals,
stated
and
rejected
arnold
on
the
ground
that
there
was
lack
of
precedent
and
also
that
there
was
a
lack
of
reasoning
in
the
case.
well,
this
was
actually
a
case
of
first
impression
for
all
practical
purposes
and,
thus,
there
was
a
lack
of
precedent
for
it.
but
i
believe
that
the
study
of
the
legislating
history,
study
of
the
acts
themselves,
and
the
study
of
the
cases
cited
by
the
government
and
the
cases
which
i
shall
cite,
support
arnold
and
give
reasoning,
arnold
was
first.
there
is
no
doubt
about
it,
it
was
the
first
opinion,
but
nevertheless
i
think
that
we
have
a
proper
reason
that
can
be
found
in
these
cases
and
also
in
the
statutes.
now
petitioners
were
convicted
under
section
1952,
the
travel
act.
they
were
horse
race
bookies
and
they
use
what
is
known
as
the
illinois
sports
news,
i
don’t
believe
if
we
got
this
in
the
record
pointed
out,
but
this
was
the
illinois
sports
news.
it’s
a
newspaper
published
in
chicago,
illinois
and
is
used
by
bookies,
because
it
contains
horse
race
betting
information
and
predictions.
this
paper
was
sent
to
the
petitioners
who
all
reside
in
lake
county,
indiana
and
so
that
--
some
of
them
were
my
informers
when
i
was
in
the
fbi.
these
persons
used
this,
this
paper
was
sent
from
chicago,
illinois
to
hammond,
indiana
and
it
was
consigned
to
what
was
known
as
the
hammond
news
agency.
these
petitioners
according
to
the
record
went
to
the
railroad
station
and
picked
up
the
copies
of
it
dropping,
leaving
their
money
there
and
took
the
copies
and
they
did
use
it
in
their
horse
racing
operations.
the
illinois
sport
news
has
been
held
to
be
a
newspaper
and
exempt
under
section
1953
of
title
18,
which
is
the
companion
section,
and
it
was
so
held
by
the
seventh
circuit
which
treated
this
case
previously
and
that
was
in
kelly
versus
illinois
bell
telephone
company,
that's
a
1963
case.
i
am
giving
the
citation
because
there
were
two
kelly
cases
that
i
have
in
the
briefs,
325
f.
2nd.
148
and
it
was
held
in
a
general
way
by
the
seventh
circuit,
to
be
a
newspaper
and
exempt
from
the
operation
of
section
1953.
now,
congress
had
a
right
--
had
a
reason
to
exempt
newspapers
from
section
1953
and
that's
to
protect
the
right
for
free
press.
but
in
passing
1953,
it
permitted
the
interstate
transportation
of
a
paper
carrying
with
it
information,
carrying
with
it
gambling
information,
betting
information.
this
information
could
be
used
for
only
one
purpose,
none
but
or
so
a
nothing
else.
it's
worth
for
anything
for
anything
else
except
gambling,
it’s
a
betting
paper,
but
congress
permitted
this
to
be
passed
and
they
knew
it
couldn’t
be
passed
and
in
doing
so
they
knew
it,
it
would
be
transported
for
one
purpose
and
that
is
to
use
for
gambling
purpose.
this
is
not
going
to
be
used
to
paper
walls,
it's
not
going
to
be
use
line
bureau
drawers.
it's
strictly
a
gambling
paper
and
government
made
that
quite
plain
in
the
various
trials
that
we
had.
now,
the
cases
cited
by
the
government
in
opposition
can
be
distinguished
from
the
cases
before
the
court,
and
also
from
arnold,
in
fact,
i
think
they
help
to
explain
arnold.
u.s.
versus
miller
which
is
cited
in
the
brief,
that's
a
1967
case
out
of
seventh
circuit,
once
all
this
began.
the
defendants
there
subscribed
to
western
union
service,
the
defendants
had
a
ticker,
they
paid
for
it,
they
have
it
in
their
gambling
joint
wherever
it
was
in
lake
county,
indiana
and
they
used
the
information
from
that.
they
caused,
they
did
not
cause
the
interstate
commerce
or
cause
the
use
of
an
interstate
facility.
they
used
it,
they
actually
used
it,
and
the
case
before
the
court
that
these
petitioners
did
not
subscribe
to
any
paper,
they
did
not
order
any
paper.
they
did
not
cause
any
direct
use
of
interstate
commerce.
the
next
case
is
u.s.
versus
azar,
which
is
a
1964
case,
it’s
a
district
court
case
in
michigan.
there
we
had
another
paper
much
like
the
illinois
sport
news,
it’s
called
the
green
sheet
and
the
green
sheet
was
published
in
ohio.
the
two
defendants
in
azar
traveled
from
detroit,
michigan
to
ohio
where
the
paper
is
published,
and
there
they
gave
information,
which
was
used
in
the
paper,
actually
used
in
the
paper,
and
then
the
paper
was
sent
across
states
lines
back
into
michigan
and
there
the
defendants
as
consignees
picked
up
the
paper,
they
--
the
paper
was
sent
to
them.
they
used
interstate
commerce,
they
caused
its
use
by
being
consignees
and
they
also
traveled
across
the
state
line
to
add,
to
give
information
for
publication.
it
was
direct
travel
in
interstate
commerce,
we
did
not
have
it
in
the
case
at
bar.
the
next
case
was
u.s.
versus
ross,
a
1967
case
and
it
was
in
the
sixth
circuit.
the
defendant
was
a
subscriber
to
what
is
known
as
the
angel-kaplan
sports
publications.
now
this
is
similar
to
the
illinois
sport
news
i
assume.
now
this
was
shipped
in
interstate
commerce
to
the
defendant
in
tennessee.
the
defendant
admitted
in
this
case
that
he
was
a
subscriber,
he
was
a
subscriber
to
this
paper.
it
was
sent
to
him
directly
and
he
in
effect
caused
the
use
of
interstate
commerce
which
was
not
true
of
the
defendants
--
petitioners
in
our
case.
and
the
last
case
with
the
government
cited
was
us
versus
mendonez
(ph)
a
1968
case
out
of
the
circuit
court
of
--
out
of
fifth
circuit
court
of
the
appeals.
the
defendants
in
florida
used
the
telephone
to
new
york
to
get
the
total
liabilities
of
the
12
federal
reserve
banks
and
the
12
–
the
total
was
to
be
used
that
as
the
winning
number
in
their
lottery
game
here
again.
they
used
a
directly
interstate
commerce,
an
interstate
facility
which
is
not
true
of
our
defendants
--
of
our
petitioners.
now
the
seventh
circuit,
back
to
the
seventh
circuit
in
united
states
v.
mccormick,
a
1971
case
442
f2nd
316.
the
court
spoke
differently
on
the
use
of
interstate
facility
then
in
the
cases
before
this
court,
spoke
entirely
differently
and
i
want
to
bring
these
cases
these
two
cases
to
the
court's
attention.
the
court
there
--
the
defendant
mccormick,
the
man
in
indianapolis,
he
advertised
in
the
daily
newspaper
–
in
a
weekly
newspaper
for
salesmen
to
be
used
in
his
gambling
scheme,
in
his
lottery
scheme
and
these
salesman,
this
paper
went
across
the
states
lines
or
sent
through
mails
not
only
through
mails
but
it
was
sent
indiana
interstate
commerce.
and
the
government
urge
that
this
was
a
sufficient
use
of
interstate
--
of
an
interstate
facility.
the
seventh
circuit
reverse
this
and
said
and
i
would
like
to
read
this,
just
the
part
of
this
decision.
the
u.s.
versus
mccormick
and
they
start
out.
mr.
charles
w.
grubb
oh!
thank
you,
thank
you.
[luncheon
break]
mr.
charles
w.
grubb
thank
you,
your
honor.
i
was
about
to
read
from
u.s.
versus
mccormick,
that
is
a
case
of
in
all
the
seventh
circuit
court
and
i
am
reading
here
from
mccormick.
in
rewis
versus
us
401
u.s
and
i
will
give
the
correct
citation,
they
did
not
have
it
here,
it
is
28
led
2nd
493,
the
supreme
court
reverse
the
conviction
of
a
gambler
whose
lottery
operation
was
frequented
by
our
state
letters.
construing
this
same
section,
the
court
emphasized
the
intent
of
congress
to
strike
at
the
truly
interstate
operations
of
organized
crime.
the
court
refused
to
give
broad
ranging
application
to
the
statute,
particularly
since
congress
gave
no
indication
that
it
wished
to
alter
the
sensitive
federal
state
relationships,
over
extend
limited
federal
police
resources
or
produce
situations
in
which
the
geographic
origins
of
customers
a
matters
of
happen
stats
would
transform
relatively
minor
state
offenses
into
federal
felonies.
similarly
and
i
still
reading
from
mccormick,
similarly
in
u.s.
versus
altobella,
442
f
2nd
310
also
in
the
seventh
circuit.
this
court
struck
down
the
conviction
of
two
extortioners
under
the
section
1952
where
jurisdiction
was
claimed
on
the
basis
that
the
victims'
check
was
cleared
by
mail
between
chicago
and
philadelphia
stated,
“when
both
use
of
the
interstate
facility
and
the
subsequent
act
is
as
minimal
and
incidental
as
in
this
case,
we
do
not
believe
a
federal
crime
has
been
committed.”
the
court
then
reversed
and
added
in
mccormick,
“defendant
neither
used
nor
caused
to
be
used
and
the
interstate
facility
as
an
instrumental
part
of
his
illegal
operations.
we
must
therefore
conclude
that
no
federal
prime
was
committed
and
that
the
state
of
indiana
is
the
only
appropriate
authority
to
punish
the
defendant
for
maintaining
this
local
lottery.
mr.
charles
w.
grubb
yes
sir.
mr.
charles
w.
grubb
no
--
mr.
charles
w.
grubb
yes.
the
mccormick
is
–
the
rewis,
i
mean,
altobella
is
in
442
f2nd
310
and
mccormick
is
a
1971
case
it
is
also
in
442
f2nd
316.
mr.
charles
w.
grubb
now
in
mccormick
the
seventh
circuit
--
mr.
charles
w.
grubb
rewis.
mr.
charles
w.
grubb
yes
rewis,
i
am
going
to
go
--
mr.
charles
w.
grubb
yes
it
is
in
401
that
is
right,
i
did
not
have
the
u.s.
citation
i
have
the
supreme
court
citation,
the
supreme
court
reporter
and
led.
now
in
mccormick
the
seventh
circuit
that
held
transportation
of
in
newspaper
information
is
not
a
sufficient
use
of
interstate
facility
to
sustain
a
conviction,
also
in
altobella,
cited
in
mccormick,
the
court
held
at
the
clearance
of
a
check
through
the
mail
in
interstate
commerce
is
insufficient,
is
an
insufficient
use
of
an
interstate
facility
although
the
courts
have
held
for
years
that
under
section
2314
which
is
the
interstate
transportation
of
stolen
property
act,
under
section
2314
of
title
18
that
a
clearance
of
a
check
does
give
jurisdiction,
but
altobella
said
no.
it
is
difficult
for
me
to
reconcile
these
case
with
the
case
at
bar
and
also
with
arnold,
the
reasoning
that
the
court
did
give
and
these
cases
were
cited
before
the
seventh
circuit
when
i
argued
it
there.
now,
although
the
court
in
arnold
did
not
exhaustively
explain
its
opinion.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
cases
which
is
cited
by
the
government,
in
the
legislative
history
here
and
the
cases
cited
by
the
petitioner
of
all
give
some
reasoning
to
arnold
and
i
think
that
arnold
in
all
its
simplicity
should
be
followed,
but
back
to
rewis.
this
court
made
it
plain
that
the
travel
act
is
to
be
applied
to
truly
interstate
operations
of
organized
crime
and
the
seventh
circuit
so
read
that
in
the
rewis
decision
when
it
handed
down
the
mccormick
decision.
now
the
court
in
rewis,
i'll
only
read
one
short
excerpt
in
rewis.
mr.
charles
w.
grubb
yes
rewis
it
is
a
--
i
have
the
supreme
court
reporter
citation
here.
it
is
a
401,
it
is
--
this
is
what
was
stated
in
rewis,
“legislative
history
of
the
act
was
limited
but
does
review
that
1952
was
aimed
primarily
and
organized
crime
and
more
specifically
at
persons
who
reside
in
one
state
while
operating
or
managing
illegal
activities
located
in
another.
in
addition,
we
are
struck
by
what
congress
did
not
say,
and
court
further
said
in
rewis
that
matters
of
happen
stance
should
not
transform
relatively
minor
state
offenses
into
federal
felonies.
in
conclusion
i
like
to
state
that
here
there
was
no
organized
crime
ever
met,
no
evidence
of
any
organized
crime.
these
petitioners
were
all
independent
operators
or
they
were
employees
of
independent
operators.
they
never
ordered
nor
subscribed
to
the
illinois
sport
news.
they
merely,
they
did
not
use
the
chicago
south
shore
and
south
bend
railroad
commonly
known
as
south
shore
railroad
the
did
not
used
that
railroad.
they
picked
up
the
papers
there
but
they
were
consigned
to
the
hammond
news
agency,
just
to
same
as
many
of
us
do
in
the
morning
to
get
our
morning
paper
when
the
drug
stores
close
and
we
got
there
and
we
want
to
get
our
paper
for
we
got
on
the
computer,
train
we
pick
out
a
newspaper
out
of
bundle
and
leave
our
money
for
it
and
go
on
our
way.
mr.
charles
w.
grubb
that
is
right.
mr.
charles
w.
grubb
that
is
right
and
i
think
that
these
--
section
1953,
be
the
latest
in
the
statute
should
control,
i
believe
does
control
that
the
two
seconds
must
be
construed
impaired
material
and
i
cited
the
what
i
think
is
a
leading
case
on
that
and
i
believe
that
altered
them
section
1952
to
the
extent
it
was
not
to
be
--
that
it
was
a
exempt
for
use.
thank
you.
mr.
charles
w.
grubb
i
have
no
further,
your
honor.
