mr.
allan
a.
tuttle
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
11
petitioners
here
were
convicted
on
five
separate
indictments
after
five
separate
jury
trials
of
using
and
causing
the
use
of
and
interstate
facility,
in
this
case
the
chicago
south
shore
and
south
bend
railroad
to
promote
and
facilitate
the
operation
of
an
illegal
gambling
operation
in
hammond,
indiana.
i
had
thought
that
the
question
which
this
court
had
addressed
itself
to
when
it
granted
certiorari
was
the
question
of
whether
since
section
1953
contains
a
specific
exclusion
for
newspapers,
are
we
to
assume
that
congress
intended
to
exclude
from
the
scope
of
the
act
an
individual
who
had
scratch
sheets
sent
to
him
through
the
facilities
of
interstate
commerce
and
thereafter
use
the
scratch
sheets
to
promote
his
unlawful
activity.
as
mr.
grubb
has
argued
the
case
he
seems
to
me
to
i
have
argued
a
difference
case
and
one
on
which
this
court
did
not
grant
certiorari.
one
on
which
jury
resolved
against
these
defendants
and
one
which
the
court
appeals
resolved
against
these
defendants
and
one
which
no
petition
for
certiorari
was
filed.
mr.
grub
contains
--
maintains
excuse
me
that
these
petitioners
did
not
cause
the
use
of
an
interstate
facility.
the
jury
was
instructed
on
this
question
and
the
jury
returned
a
verdict
finding
that
these
petitioners
had
in
fact
caused
the
use
of
this
railroad.
the
court
of
appeals
made
the
same
finding.
indeed
it
seems
to
me
that
mr.
grubb
has
conceded
the
main
question
in
this
case,
when
he
says
the
case
is
like
ross
and
azar
are
to
be
distinguished.
ross
was
distinguished
by
mr.
grubb
just
now
on
the
ground
that
ross
had
subscribed
to
a
paper
in
chicago
and
thereby
had
in
fact
caused
the
interstate
shipment,
but
if
the
question
is
whether
the
shipment
of
these
papers
through
the
channels
of
commerce
is
a
subject
of
the
travel
act,
then
in
conceding
that
ross
was
properly
decided,
in
my
view
that
concedes
the
main
question
in
this
case.
i
might
say
the
same
as
true
of
azar.
in
azar
for
instance,
again,
it
was
an
interstate
shipment
of
scratch
sheets
of
the
kind
that
we
have
in
this
case,
and
in
azar,
in
fact
one
of
the
two
defendants
didn't
travel
in
interstate
commerce,
one
did,
the
other
remained
in
detroit
and
picked
up
the
packages
when
they
reached
their
destination
consigned
to
a
mr.
williams
in
detroit.
now
i
will
address
myself
to
what
i
consider
to
be
the
question
which
this
court
--
upon
which
this
court
granted
certiorari
which
is
the
question
of
the
scope
of
the
travel
act
and
whether
the
transportation
or
causing
the
transportation
of
the
sheets
through
the
facilities
of
interstate
commerce
could
violate
the
travel
act
and
in
the
course
of
stating
the
facts
of
the
case,
i
may
shed
some
line
on
the
question
which
mr.
grubb
has
raised,
but
which
i
can
see
or
which
i
contend
is
not
before
this
court.
the
petitioners
were
owners
and
operators
five
separate
horse
race
betting
parlors
in
hammond,
indiana,
each
of
which
was
and
was
conceded
to
be
operated
in
violation
of
the
laws
of
indiana.
now
in
connection
with
the
operation
of
these
horse
race
betting
parlors,
petitioners
used
a
publication
known
as
the
illinois
sports
news.
mr.
grubb
has
showed
the
court
a
copy
of
the
illinois
sports
news.
the
sports
news
is
known
as
the
scratch
sheet,
a
scratch
as
the
court
may
know,
is
a
horse
that
has
been
withdrawn
from
a
race
in
which
it
was
previously
entered
and
the
withdrawal
is
not
reflected
perhaps
on
the
afternoon,
previous
afternoon's
racing
forms.
therefore,
the
scratch
sheet
is
of
considerable
value
because
it's
published
at
8
am
in
the
morning,
distributed
promptly
and
can
be
used
by
betters
in
placing
their
wagers
on
that
day's
races.
indeed
the
testimony
in
this
case
shows
that
the
scratch
sheet
was
vital
to
these
operations.
one
convicted
co-conspirator
who
testified
for
the
government,
testified
that
on
days
when
the
scratch
sheet
failed
to
arrive,
business
fell
off
by
as
much
as
80
%.
there
is
also
evidence
that
the
entire
shipment
by
the
month
to
the
hammond
new
agency
dropped
off
drastically
after
the
race
in
this
case.
mr.
allan
a.
tuttle
oh!
i
am
sorry,
your
honor,
it
contains
more
than
that.
it
contains
for
instance
the
day's
entries,
it
contains
the
jockeys
and
their
weights,
it
contains
the
track
handicapper's
predictions
and
sometimes
predictions
of
the
publishers
themselves.
mr.
allan
a.
tuttle
that's
right,
but
that's
only
one
aspect
of
the
information
which
is
contained.
it
is
the
information
which
makes
a
scratch
sheet
different
from
other
kinds
of
horse
race
betting
publications
and
makes
it
important
that
it
will
be
published
early
in
the
morning
and
gotten
out
and
distributed
very
quickly.
mr.
allan
a.
tuttle
that
would
be
called
the
morning
line,
the
handicapper's
odds
and
the
other
information
that
i
have
spoken
and
the
rapidity
with
which
this
is
distributed
or
must
be
distributed
is
reflected
in
the
facts
of
this
case.
these
petitioners
and
their
co-conspirators
by
prearrangement
with
the
local
news
agency,
the
hammond
news
agency,
arranged
to
pick
up
their
copies
of
the
illinois
sports
news
at
approximately
9:02
in
the
morning
when
the
8:30
train
from
the
randolph
street
station
in
chicago,
illinois
arrived
with
these
scratch
sheets
on
it.
the
petitioners
would
then
take
their
scratch
sheets
and
distribute
them
to
their
various
horse
race
betting
parlors.
now
there
are
many
copies
that
arrived
everyday
consigned
to
the
hammond
news
agency.
approximately
57
were
picked
up
and
used
by
the
co-conspirators
in
this
–
in
these
five
separate
cases.
mr
goodman
(ph)
whom
i
have
mentioned
testified
for
the
government
picked
up
22
copies
a
day
to
use
in
his
gambling
operations.
he
paid
for
them
weekly
to
the
hammond
news
agency,
a
mr.
frost
(ph)
of
the
hammond
news
agency.
another
35
copies
--
mr.
allan
a.
tuttle
as
a
matter
of
fact,
they
are,
your
honor.
at
the
time
of
the
trial,
they
were
$00.35
a
piece.
now
much
of
the
same
information
is
--
can
be
obtained
from
other
papers,
but
this
is
this
which
contains
no
information
except
racing
information
is
more
expensive
because
of
its
rapidity
of
distribution
and
fact
that
you
can
get
it
early,
you
can
place
your
bets
early.
but
my
point
of
indicating
the
arrangement
for
payment
was
in
a
way
to
allude
indirectly
the
question
of
causation
because
in
this
case
there
was
an
arrangement
to
receive
22
copies
a
day
and
to
pay
for
them
on
a
weekly
basis
to
the
hammond
news
agency
which
was
the
consignee
of
these
papers
from
chicago.
the
other
35
which
were
picked
by
the
co-conspirators
were
picked
up
at
9
o'clock
in
the
morning
and
they
left
envelops
of
cash
at
the
train
station.
later
on
in
the
morning
in
the
ordinary
course
of
business,
employees
of
the
hammond
news
agency
would
come,
pick
up
the
remaining
33
copies
and
distribute
them
to
various
retail
outlets
around
the
hammond
area
and
they
would
hit
the
news
stance
around
11
--
10:30
or
11,
much
later
of
course
than
these
petitioners
had
it
and
had
it
for
use
in
their
betting
parlors.
now
as
i
have
suggested
the
question
is
whether
the
exclusion
of
these
papers
from
1953
entails
a
similar
exclusion
from
1952.
the
statute
in
this
case,
the
travel
act,
provides
and
i
will
read
if
the
court
will
indulge
me,
the
relevant
part
of
the
statute.
the
statute
provides
whoever
uses
any
facility
in
interstate
commerce
would
be
intent
and
then
in
subparagraph
3,
to
promote,
manage,
carry
on,
establish,
or
facilitate
the
promotion,
management,
or
establishment,
or
carrying
on,
of
any
unlawful
activity,
and
thereafter
performs
any
act,
specified
in
subparagraph
3
which
i
have
just
read
you,
violates
the
travel
act.
and
then
the
statute
defines
an
unlawful
act
and
significantly
it
defines
it
as
a
business
activity,
a
business
enterprise
involving
gambling,
gambling
offenses
in
violation
of
the
laws
of
the
state
in
which
they
were
committed.
now
the
congressional
hearings
reflect
a
concern
that
otherwise
lawful
or
innocent
interstate
travel
was
being
used
to
facilitate
illegal
gambling
and
i
stress
illegal
gambling.
as
you
know
the
travel
act
prescribes
interstate
travel
with
a
purpose
to
promote
other
violations
of
state
law
such
as
narcotics
violations,
liquor
violations,
prostitution
violations,
extortion,
arson,
extortion
and
bribery
and
that
has
been
amended
to
include
arson
and
controlled
substances.
but
at
the
time
of
the
hearings,
when
attorney
general
kennedy
testified
on
behalf
of
this
legislation,
the
stress
was
on
gambling
and
the
fact
that
$20,000,000,00
a
year
changed
hands
in
gambling
and
gambling
was
a
prime
source
of
funds
for
the
underworld.
indeed
his
examples
all
involved
gambling.
he
spoke
for
example
of
moving
the
proceeds
of
an
illegal
gambling
operation
in
one
state
to
another
state
or
he
spoke
for
example
of
the
interstate
and
nationwide
travel
of
layoff
men,
which
indicated
gambling
operations.
now
if
congress
was
concerned
with
otherwise
lawful
travel
which
might
be
the
subject
of
promoting
an
unlawful
or
illegal
activity
and
violation
of
state
law,
congress
was
equally
careful
not
to
make
innocent
interstate
travel
the
subject
of
criminal
sanctions,
and
it
was
senator
erwin
(ph)
who
stressed
this
and
senator
erwin
stated
that
he
would
hate
to
see
the
time
come
when
this
country
would
make
it
a
crime
to
travel,
having
certain
thoughts,
as
he
conceived
that
this
act
could
make
it
a
crime
simply
that
you
would
be
thinking
something
while
you
are
traveling
interstate.
and
in
reaction
to
senator
erwin's
concern,
the
judiciary
committee
amended
the
law
and
they
added
a
second
proviso,
they
provided
as
in
the
overt
act
requirement
in
conspiracy
cases,
they
provided
the
act
of
the
interstate
travel,
the
individual
do
something
which
promotes
the
unlawful
activity,
thereby
assuring
that
the
statute
would
involve
any
kind
of
thought
control
or
punish
somebody
merely
for
their
thoughts.
now
the
statute
was
also
limited
to
be
sure
not
to
apply
to
the
individual
gambler
who
might
be
traveling
interstate.
even
if
he
traveled
interstate
with
the
intent
to
engage
in
illegal
gambling
and
thereafter
in
fact
engaged
in
illegal
gambling,
the
statute
wouldn't
cover
such
activity
as
attorney
general
kennedy
stressed
when
he
testified
in
support
of
this
legislation
that
the
target
was
organized
crime
and
the
statute
had
been
drafted
to
cover
only
what
was
called
travel
in
furtherance
of
“business
enterprises”
so
that
no
casual
or
sporadic
involvement
in
gambling
activities
would
be
covered,
but
only
such
regular
and
continuous
conduct
as
might
be
classified
as
a
business
enterprise.
in
this
way,
travel
in
interstate
commerce
even
with
an
unlawful
purpose
in
mind
is
not
covered
unless
it
is
followed
by
some
kind
of
overt
act
after
the
travel
which
promotes
the
unlawful
activity,
and
of
course
the
same
language
makes
it
equally
clear
or
doubly
plain
that
innocent
interstate
travel
could
never
be
the
subject
of
any
sanction
under
this
law.
now
of
course
there
is
nothing
novel
about
congress
making
interstate
travel
for
an
unlawful
purpose,
the
subject
of
a
criminal
sanction
and
criminal
responsibility.
it
is
after
all
no
crime
to
travel
interstate
with
a
woman,
but
in
fact
travelers
for
the
purposes
of
prostitution,
the
mann
act
is
violated.
similarly,
it
is
no
crime
to
travel
interstate
with
a
child,
but
if
the
child
is
held
for
ransom
and
reward,
the
limbard
(ph)
law
is
violated.
the
mails
are
available
to
anyone,
but
if
the
mails
are
used
in
furtherance
of
a
scheme
to
the
fraud,
the
mail
fraud
statute
is
violated.
by
the
same
token,
anyone
can
use
the
telephone,
make
a
long
distance
telephone
call,
or
anyone
can
equally
send
a
telegram
interstate,
but
if
these
facilities
are
used
to
further
an
unlawful
activity,
then
the
legitimate
objects
for
congressional
concern
and
congressional
regulation,
and
as
this
court
knows,
a
classic
violation
of
the
travel
act
is
the
use
of
the
interstate
wires
to
convey
betting
information,
wagers
or
rational
results.
now
just
this
gambling
information
can
be
sent
interstate
to
gamblers
over
the
wires,
so
the
morning
line
in
the
illinois
sports
news
can
be
sent
interstate
to
promote
illegal
gambling
operations
and
this
fact
no
more
inhibits
the
lawful
movement
of
the
illinois
sports
news,
then
the
mann
act
or
the
limbard
law
inhibits
the
interstate
travel
of
woman
or
children.
now
in
our
view,
section
1953
achieves
its
result
of
avoiding
criminal
responsibility
for
innocent
conduct
by
an
entirely
different
route.
section
1953
defines
a
class
of
contraband,
the
interstate
shipment
of
which
is
banned
irrespective
of
the
purpose
for
which
it
is
sent
or
the
motive
for
which
it
is
sent
or
the
use
to
which
it
is
put,
after
it
is
sent.
section
1953
defines
gambling
paraphernalia
in
very
broad
language,
including
any
slip,
token,
paper,
writing,
or
other
device
designed
or
adapted
for
use
in
book
making
or
wagering
on
sports
activities
or
numbers
operation.
it
was
this
broad
language
which
the
senator
keating
(ph)
in
the
hearings
on
the
bill
to
express
concerning
that
you
or
i
or
anyone
else
might
commit
a
crime
under
the
1953
provision
by
traveling
from
here
to
new
york
carrying
a
copy
of
the
post
because
it
might
happen
to
contain
the
results
of
a
sporting
activity
or
the
results
of
a
horse
race.
and
it
was
in
response
to
this
concern
that
congress
amended
the
statute
to
say
“this
section
shall
not
apply
the
carriage
or
transportation
in
interstate
commerce
of
any
newspaper
or
similar
publication,
and
we
concede
for
the
purposes
of
this
argument
in
any
event
that
the
scratch
sheet
would
qualify
under
that
subsection.
it
seems
to
us
that
what
1952
achieves
by
limiting
its
coverage
in
terms
of
the
intent
of
the
activity
and
the
overt
acts
which
are
required
after
the
activity,
1953
achieves
by
a
simple
definitional
exclusion.
now
congress
recognized
that
otherwise
innocent
travel
or
movement
in
interstate
commerce
could
in
fact
be
the
subject
of
criminal
responsibility,
whether
the
requisite
intend
was
present
and
where
they
were
overt
acts
in
furtherance
of
the
unlawful
activity
following
that
interstate
travel
or
movement.
we
see
no
reason
to
assume
that
congress
intended
that
one
particular
kind
of
innocent
act,
in
this
case,
the
transportation
by
rail
of
newspapers
should
be
excluded
from
the
subject
of
criminal
responsibility
if
and
only
if
the
requisite
purpose
is
there
and
overt
act
is
there
following
the
interstate
movement
or
the
causing
of
the
interstate
movement.
mr.
allan
a.
tuttle
oh!
standing
alone,
it
does
nothing
at
all.
one
would
have
to
hypothesize
circumstances
under
which
it
was
used.
i
mean
to
ship
alone
doesn't
violate
the
act
in
any
regard.
one
has
to
hypothesize
the
subsequent
use
--
mr.
allan
a.
tuttle
well,
again
it
depends
--
the
act
requires
that
it
be
shipped
with
a
given
purpose
to
promote
an
unlawful
activity
and
requires
also
that
act
of
the
shipment
is
used
to
promote
the
unlawful
activity.
mr.
allan
a.
tuttle
no
question
about
it,
in
our
view,
assuming
of
course,
that
they
were
then
used
in
furtherance
of
the
unlawful
activity.
we
do
not
--
assuming
as
we
do
for
the
purposes
of
argument
that
this
is
a
lawful
publication,
we
would
argue
that
the
statute
could,
in
principal
be
violated
by
the
use
of
any
publication
if
it
were
used
with
the
requisite
intent
and
if
it
were
caused
to
be
shipped
in
interstate
commerce
and
if
it
were
thereafter
used
to
promote
an
unlawful
activity.
now
we
believe
that
the
evidence
in
this
case
show
that
these
petitioners
in
fact
caused
the
interstate
shipment
of
the
illinois
sports
news.
now
i
have
recited
to
you
the
way
in
which
it
was
obtained,
the
way
in
which
it
was
distributed,
the
way
in
which
it
was
picked
up,
and
the
way
in
which
it
was
used.
we
therefore
believe
that
these
individuals
caused
the
interstate
shipment
of
these
newspapers
with
the
intent
to
promote
their
unlawful
gambling
operations,
that
they
thereafter
used
these
newspapers
in
violation
of
indiana
law
to
promote
their
unlawful
gambling
operations.
and
we
therefore
believe
that
they
were
guilty
as
charged
in
the
indictment
and
as
the
jury
found,
and
we
further
believe
that
the
convictions
should
be
affirmed.
mr.
allan
a.
tuttle
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
11
petitioners
here
were
convicted
on
five
separate
indictments
after
five
separate
jury
trials
of
using
and
causing
the
use
of
and
interstate
facility,
in
this
case
the
chicago
south
shore
and
south
bend
railroad
to
promote
and
facilitate
the
operation
of
an
illegal
gambling
operation
in
hammond,
indiana.
i
had
thought
that
the
question
which
this
court
had
addressed
itself
to
when
it
granted
certiorari
was
the
question
of
whether
since
section
1953
contains
a
specific
exclusion
for
newspapers,
are
we
to
assume
that
congress
intended
to
exclude
from
the
scope
of
the
act
an
individual
who
had
scratch
sheets
sent
to
him
through
the
facilities
of
interstate
commerce
and
thereafter
use
the
scratch
sheets
to
promote
his
unlawful
activity.
as
mr.
grubb
has
argued
the
case
he
seems
to
me
to
i
have
argued
a
difference
case
and
one
on
which
this
court
did
not
grant
certiorari.
one
on
which
jury
resolved
against
these
defendants
and
one
which
the
court
appeals
resolved
against
these
defendants
and
one
which
no
petition
for
certiorari
was
filed.
mr.
grub
contains
--
maintains
excuse
me
that
these
petitioners
did
not
cause
the
use
of
an
interstate
facility.
the
jury
was
instructed
on
this
question
and
the
jury
returned
a
verdict
finding
that
these
petitioners
had
in
fact
caused
the
use
of
this
railroad.
the
court
of
appeals
made
the
same
finding.
indeed
it
seems
to
me
that
mr.
grubb
has
conceded
the
main
question
in
this
case,
when
he
says
the
case
is
like
ross
and
azar
are
to
be
distinguished.
ross
was
distinguished
by
mr.
grubb
just
now
on
the
ground
that
ross
had
subscribed
to
a
paper
in
chicago
and
thereby
had
in
fact
caused
the
interstate
shipment,
but
if
the
question
is
whether
the
shipment
of
these
papers
through
the
channels
of
commerce
is
a
subject
of
the
travel
act,
then
in
conceding
that
ross
was
properly
decided,
in
my
view
that
concedes
the
main
question
in
this
case.
i
might
say
the
same
as
true
of
azar.
in
azar
for
instance,
again,
it
was
an
interstate
shipment
of
scratch
sheets
of
the
kind
that
we
have
in
this
case,
and
in
azar,
in
fact
one
of
the
two
defendants
didn't
travel
in
interstate
commerce,
one
did,
the
other
remained
in
detroit
and
picked
up
the
packages
when
they
reached
their
destination
consigned
to
a
mr.
williams
in
detroit.
now
i
will
address
myself
to
what
i
consider
to
be
the
question
which
this
court
--
upon
which
this
court
granted
certiorari
which
is
the
question
of
the
scope
of
the
travel
act
and
whether
the
transportation
or
causing
the
transportation
of
the
sheets
through
the
facilities
of
interstate
commerce
could
violate
the
travel
act
and
in
the
course
of
stating
the
facts
of
the
case,
i
may
shed
some
line
on
the
question
which
mr.
grubb
has
raised,
but
which
i
can
see
or
which
i
contend
is
not
before
this
court.
the
petitioners
were
owners
and
operators
five
separate
horse
race
betting
parlors
in
hammond,
indiana,
each
of
which
was
and
was
conceded
to
be
operated
in
violation
of
the
laws
of
indiana.
now
in
connection
with
the
operation
of
these
horse
race
betting
parlors,
petitioners
used
a
publication
known
as
the
illinois
sports
news.
mr.
grubb
has
showed
the
court
a
copy
of
the
illinois
sports
news.
the
sports
news
is
known
as
the
scratch
sheet,
a
scratch
as
the
court
may
know,
is
a
horse
that
has
been
withdrawn
from
a
race
in
which
it
was
previously
entered
and
the
withdrawal
is
not
reflected
perhaps
on
the
afternoon,
previous
afternoon's
racing
forms.
therefore,
the
scratch
sheet
is
of
considerable
value
because
it's
published
at
8
am
in
the
morning,
distributed
promptly
and
can
be
used
by
betters
in
placing
their
wagers
on
that
day's
races.
indeed
the
testimony
in
this
case
shows
that
the
scratch
sheet
was
vital
to
these
operations.
one
convicted
co-conspirator
who
testified
for
the
government,
testified
that
on
days
when
the
scratch
sheet
failed
to
arrive,
business
fell
off
by
as
much
as
80
%.
there
is
also
evidence
that
the
entire
shipment
by
the
month
to
the
hammond
new
agency
dropped
off
drastically
after
the
race
in
this
case.
mr.
allan
a.
tuttle
oh!
i
am
sorry,
your
honor,
it
contains
more
than
that.
it
contains
for
instance
the
day's
entries,
it
contains
the
jockeys
and
their
weights,
it
contains
the
track
handicapper's
predictions
and
sometimes
predictions
of
the
publishers
themselves.
mr.
allan
a.
tuttle
that's
right,
but
that's
only
one
aspect
of
the
information
which
is
contained.
it
is
the
information
which
makes
a
scratch
sheet
different
from
other
kinds
of
horse
race
betting
publications
and
makes
it
important
that
it
will
be
published
early
in
the
morning
and
gotten
out
and
distributed
very
quickly.
mr.
allan
a.
tuttle
that
would
be
called
the
morning
line,
the
handicapper's
odds
and
the
other
information
that
i
have
spoken
and
the
rapidity
with
which
this
is
distributed
or
must
be
distributed
is
reflected
in
the
facts
of
this
case.
these
petitioners
and
their
co-conspirators
by
prearrangement
with
the
local
news
agency,
the
hammond
news
agency,
arranged
to
pick
up
their
copies
of
the
illinois
sports
news
at
approximately
9:02
in
the
morning
when
the
8:30
train
from
the
randolph
street
station
in
chicago,
illinois
arrived
with
these
scratch
sheets
on
it.
the
petitioners
would
then
take
their
scratch
sheets
and
distribute
them
to
their
various
horse
race
betting
parlors.
now
there
are
many
copies
that
arrived
everyday
consigned
to
the
hammond
news
agency.
approximately
57
were
picked
up
and
used
by
the
co-conspirators
in
this
–
in
these
five
separate
cases.
mr
goodman
(ph)
whom
i
have
mentioned
testified
for
the
government
picked
up
22
copies
a
day
to
use
in
his
gambling
operations.
he
paid
for
them
weekly
to
the
hammond
news
agency,
a
mr.
frost
(ph)
of
the
hammond
news
agency.
another
35
copies
--
mr.
allan
a.
tuttle
as
a
matter
of
fact,
they
are,
your
honor.
at
the
time
of
the
trial,
they
were
$00.35
a
piece.
now
much
of
the
same
information
is
--
can
be
obtained
from
other
papers,
but
this
is
this
which
contains
no
information
except
racing
information
is
more
expensive
because
of
its
rapidity
of
distribution
and
fact
that
you
can
get
it
early,
you
can
place
your
bets
early.
but
my
point
of
indicating
the
arrangement
for
payment
was
in
a
way
to
allude
indirectly
the
question
of
causation
because
in
this
case
there
was
an
arrangement
to
receive
22
copies
a
day
and
to
pay
for
them
on
a
weekly
basis
to
the
hammond
news
agency
which
was
the
consignee
of
these
papers
from
chicago.
the
other
35
which
were
picked
by
the
co-conspirators
were
picked
up
at
9
o'clock
in
the
morning
and
they
left
envelops
of
cash
at
the
train
station.
later
on
in
the
morning
in
the
ordinary
course
of
business,
employees
of
the
hammond
news
agency
would
come,
pick
up
the
remaining
33
copies
and
distribute
them
to
various
retail
outlets
around
the
hammond
area
and
they
would
hit
the
news
stance
around
11
--
10:30
or
11,
much
later
of
course
than
these
petitioners
had
it
and
had
it
for
use
in
their
betting
parlors.
now
as
i
have
suggested
the
question
is
whether
the
exclusion
of
these
papers
from
1953
entails
a
similar
exclusion
from
1952.
the
statute
in
this
case,
the
travel
act,
provides
and
i
will
read
if
the
court
will
indulge
me,
the
relevant
part
of
the
statute.
the
statute
provides
whoever
uses
any
facility
in
interstate
commerce
would
be
intent
and
then
in
subparagraph
3,
to
promote,
manage,
carry
on,
establish,
or
facilitate
the
promotion,
management,
or
establishment,
or
carrying
on,
of
any
unlawful
activity,
and
thereafter
performs
any
act,
specified
in
subparagraph
3
which
i
have
just
read
you,
violates
the
travel
act.
and
then
the
statute
defines
an
unlawful
act
and
significantly
it
defines
it
as
a
business
activity,
a
business
enterprise
involving
gambling,
gambling
offenses
in
violation
of
the
laws
of
the
state
in
which
they
were
committed.
now
the
congressional
hearings
reflect
a
concern
that
otherwise
lawful
or
innocent
interstate
travel
was
being
used
to
facilitate
illegal
gambling
and
i
stress
illegal
gambling.
as
you
know
the
travel
act
prescribes
interstate
travel
with
a
purpose
to
promote
other
violations
of
state
law
such
as
narcotics
violations,
liquor
violations,
prostitution
violations,
extortion,
arson,
extortion
and
bribery
and
that
has
been
amended
to
include
arson
and
controlled
substances.
but
at
the
time
of
the
hearings,
when
attorney
general
kennedy
testified
on
behalf
of
this
legislation,
the
stress
was
on
gambling
and
the
fact
that
$20,000,000,00
a
year
changed
hands
in
gambling
and
gambling
was
a
prime
source
of
funds
for
the
underworld.
indeed
his
examples
all
involved
gambling.
he
spoke
for
example
of
moving
the
proceeds
of
an
illegal
gambling
operation
in
one
state
to
another
state
or
he
spoke
for
example
of
the
interstate
and
nationwide
travel
of
layoff
men,
which
indicated
gambling
operations.
now
if
congress
was
concerned
with
otherwise
lawful
travel
which
might
be
the
subject
of
promoting
an
unlawful
or
illegal
activity
and
violation
of
state
law,
congress
was
equally
careful
not
to
make
innocent
interstate
travel
the
subject
of
criminal
sanctions,
and
it
was
senator
erwin
(ph)
who
stressed
this
and
senator
erwin
stated
that
he
would
hate
to
see
the
time
come
when
this
country
would
make
it
a
crime
to
travel,
having
certain
thoughts,
as
he
conceived
that
this
act
could
make
it
a
crime
simply
that
you
would
be
thinking
something
while
you
are
traveling
interstate.
and
in
reaction
to
senator
erwin's
concern,
the
judiciary
committee
amended
the
law
and
they
added
a
second
proviso,
they
provided
as
in
the
overt
act
requirement
in
conspiracy
cases,
they
provided
the
act
of
the
interstate
travel,
the
individual
do
something
which
promotes
the
unlawful
activity,
thereby
assuring
that
the
statute
would
involve
any
kind
of
thought
control
or
punish
somebody
merely
for
their
thoughts.
now
the
statute
was
also
limited
to
be
sure
not
to
apply
to
the
individual
gambler
who
might
be
traveling
interstate.
even
if
he
traveled
interstate
with
the
intent
to
engage
in
illegal
gambling
and
thereafter
in
fact
engaged
in
illegal
gambling,
the
statute
wouldn't
cover
such
activity
as
attorney
general
kennedy
stressed
when
he
testified
in
support
of
this
legislation
that
the
target
was
organized
crime
and
the
statute
had
been
drafted
to
cover
only
what
was
called
travel
in
furtherance
of
“business
enterprises”
so
that
no
casual
or
sporadic
involvement
in
gambling
activities
would
be
covered,
but
only
such
regular
and
continuous
conduct
as
might
be
classified
as
a
business
enterprise.
in
this
way,
travel
in
interstate
commerce
even
with
an
unlawful
purpose
in
mind
is
not
covered
unless
it
is
followed
by
some
kind
of
overt
act
after
the
travel
which
promotes
the
unlawful
activity,
and
of
course
the
same
language
makes
it
equally
clear
or
doubly
plain
that
innocent
interstate
travel
could
never
be
the
subject
of
any
sanction
under
this
law.
now
of
course
there
is
nothing
novel
about
congress
making
interstate
travel
for
an
unlawful
purpose,
the
subject
of
a
criminal
sanction
and
criminal
responsibility.
it
is
after
all
no
crime
to
travel
interstate
with
a
woman,
but
in
fact
travelers
for
the
purposes
of
prostitution,
the
mann
act
is
violated.
similarly,
it
is
no
crime
to
travel
interstate
with
a
child,
but
if
the
child
is
held
for
ransom
and
reward,
the
limbard
(ph)
law
is
violated.
the
mails
are
available
to
anyone,
but
if
the
mails
are
used
in
furtherance
of
a
scheme
to
the
fraud,
the
mail
fraud
statute
is
violated.
by
the
same
token,
anyone
can
use
the
telephone,
make
a
long
distance
telephone
call,
or
anyone
can
equally
send
a
telegram
interstate,
but
if
these
facilities
are
used
to
further
an
unlawful
activity,
then
the
legitimate
objects
for
congressional
concern
and
congressional
regulation,
and
as
this
court
knows,
a
classic
violation
of
the
travel
act
is
the
use
of
the
interstate
wires
to
convey
betting
information,
wagers
or
rational
results.
now
just
this
gambling
information
can
be
sent
interstate
to
gamblers
over
the
wires,
so
the
morning
line
in
the
illinois
sports
news
can
be
sent
interstate
to
promote
illegal
gambling
operations
and
this
fact
no
more
inhibits
the
lawful
movement
of
the
illinois
sports
news,
then
the
mann
act
or
the
limbard
law
inhibits
the
interstate
travel
of
woman
or
children.
now
in
our
view,
section
1953
achieves
its
result
of
avoiding
criminal
responsibility
for
innocent
conduct
by
an
entirely
different
route.
section
1953
defines
a
class
of
contraband,
the
interstate
shipment
of
which
is
banned
irrespective
of
the
purpose
for
which
it
is
sent
or
the
motive
for
which
it
is
sent
or
the
use
to
which
it
is
put,
after
it
is
sent.
section
1953
defines
gambling
paraphernalia
in
very
broad
language,
including
any
slip,
token,
paper,
writing,
or
other
device
designed
or
adapted
for
use
in
book
making
or
wagering
on
sports
activities
or
numbers
operation.
it
was
this
broad
language
which
the
senator
keating
(ph)
in
the
hearings
on
the
bill
to
express
concerning
that
you
or
i
or
anyone
else
might
commit
a
crime
under
the
1953
provision
by
traveling
from
here
to
new
york
carrying
a
copy
of
the
post
because
it
might
happen
to
contain
the
results
of
a
sporting
activity
or
the
results
of
a
horse
race.
and
it
was
in
response
to
this
concern
that
congress
amended
the
statute
to
say
“this
section
shall
not
apply
the
carriage
or
transportation
in
interstate
commerce
of
any
newspaper
or
similar
publication,
and
we
concede
for
the
purposes
of
this
argument
in
any
event
that
the
scratch
sheet
would
qualify
under
that
subsection.
it
seems
to
us
that
what
1952
achieves
by
limiting
its
coverage
in
terms
of
the
intent
of
the
activity
and
the
overt
acts
which
are
required
after
the
activity,
1953
achieves
by
a
simple
definitional
exclusion.
now
congress
recognized
that
otherwise
innocent
travel
or
movement
in
interstate
commerce
could
in
fact
be
the
subject
of
criminal
responsibility,
whether
the
requisite
intend
was
present
and
where
they
were
overt
acts
in
furtherance
of
the
unlawful
activity
following
that
interstate
travel
or
movement.
we
see
no
reason
to
assume
that
congress
intended
that
one
particular
kind
of
innocent
act,
in
this
case,
the
transportation
by
rail
of
newspapers
should
be
excluded
from
the
subject
of
criminal
responsibility
if
and
only
if
the
requisite
purpose
is
there
and
overt
act
is
there
following
the
interstate
movement
or
the
causing
of
the
interstate
movement.
mr.
allan
a.
tuttle
oh!
standing
alone,
it
does
nothing
at
all.
one
would
have
to
hypothesize
circumstances
under
which
it
was
used.
i
mean
to
ship
alone
doesn't
violate
the
act
in
any
regard.
one
has
to
hypothesize
the
subsequent
use
--
mr.
allan
a.
tuttle
well,
again
it
depends
--
the
act
requires
that
it
be
shipped
with
a
given
purpose
to
promote
an
unlawful
activity
and
requires
also
that
act
of
the
shipment
is
used
to
promote
the
unlawful
activity.
mr.
allan
a.
tuttle
no
question
about
it,
in
our
view,
assuming
of
course,
that
they
were
then
used
in
furtherance
of
the
unlawful
activity.
we
do
not
--
assuming
as
we
do
for
the
purposes
of
argument
that
this
is
a
lawful
publication,
we
would
argue
that
the
statute
could,
in
principal
be
violated
by
the
use
of
any
publication
if
it
were
used
with
the
requisite
intent
and
if
it
were
caused
to
be
shipped
in
interstate
commerce
and
if
it
were
thereafter
used
to
promote
an
unlawful
activity.
now
we
believe
that
the
evidence
in
this
case
show
that
these
petitioners
in
fact
caused
the
interstate
shipment
of
the
illinois
sports
news.
now
i
have
recited
to
you
the
way
in
which
it
was
obtained,
the
way
in
which
it
was
distributed,
the
way
in
which
it
was
picked
up,
and
the
way
in
which
it
was
used.
we
therefore
believe
that
these
individuals
caused
the
interstate
shipment
of
these
newspapers
with
the
intent
to
promote
their
unlawful
gambling
operations,
that
they
thereafter
used
these
newspapers
in
violation
of
indiana
law
to
promote
their
unlawful
gambling
operations.
and
we
therefore
believe
that
they
were
guilty
as
charged
in
the
indictment
and
as
the
jury
found,
and
we
further
believe
that
the
convictions
should
be
affirmed.
