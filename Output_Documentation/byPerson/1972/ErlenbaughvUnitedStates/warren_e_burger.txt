well
the
boundary
of
the
case
of
the
gambling
house
near
the
state
line
is
one
out
of
this
court
last
term
where
the
term
before,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
yes.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
is
in
401
us,
the
reference
that
you
told
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
suppose
it
is
reasonably
assumed
isn't
it
mr.
grubb
that
congress
was
well
aware
that
there
were
highly
specialized
newspapers
as
you
kept
your
eyes
this
bulletin
that
catered
particularly
to
people
who
were
betting
and
to
organized
gambling,
isn't
that,
accurate?
well,
now
then
what
if
you
to
say
about
the
fact
that
the
section
1953
specially
excludes
newspapers
but
are
similar
publications
presumably
reach
this
publication,
but
that
section
1952
does
not
have
any
such
exception?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
do
you
have
to
say
about
it?
chief

warren
e.
burger
mr.
tuttle.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
are
you
emphasizing
that
he
paid
for
them?
does
that
mean
that
it's
quite
an
expensive
item?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
if
this
material
which
is
in
this
sheet,
racing
sheet
that
you
have
got
was
a
special
column
on
the
sports
page
of
a
conventional
newspaper
and
was
transported
in
the
ordinary
course
of
sending
thousands
of
them
to
philadelphia
or
richmond
or
somewhere
else.
would
that
standing
alone
violate
the
statute?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
so
it
has
to
be
connected
that
with
some
other
activity?
chief

warren
e.

well,
if
these

the

gentleman

a
hundred
of
