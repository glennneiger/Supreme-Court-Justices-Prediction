section
1952
of
title
18
of
the
code
makes
it
illegal
for
anyone
to
use
“any
facility
of
interstate
commerce
with
intent
to
promote
or
facilitate
the
operation
of
a
gambling
business
which
is
illegal
under
state
law.
petitioners
who
were
engaged
in
illegal
bookmaking
operations
in
hammond,
indiana
were
convicted
of
violating
the
statute
because
they
caused
copies
of
horse
racing
scratch
sheet
to
be
carried
by
railroad
from
chicago,
illinois
to
hammond,
indiana.
on
appeal
to
the
court
of
appeals,
the
petition
is
argued
that
causing
the
use
of
a
facility
of
interstate
commerce
to
transport
a
newspaper
or
similar
publication
was
not
intended
to
be
covered
by
1952
as
evidenced
by
the
fact
that
a
companion
statute,
1953
which
prescribes
the
interstate
transportation
of
gambling
paraphernalia
contains
an
expressed
exception
from
newspapers.
the
court
of
appeals
rejected
this
argument
and
affirmed
the
convictions.
because
this
decision
conflicted
with
the
previous
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fourth
circuit,
we
granted
certiorari.
for
reason
set
forth
in
an
opinion
on
file
with
the
clerk
of
this
court,
we
affirm
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
of
the
seventh
circuit.
we
hold
that
congress
did
not
intend
to
accept
one
who
causes
the
use
of
a
facility
of
interstate
commerce
to
transport
a
newspaper,
with
an
intent
to
promote
an
illegal
gambling
business
from
the
prohibition
set
forth
in
1952.
