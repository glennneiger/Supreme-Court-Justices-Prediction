do
you
think
the
--
the
rule
that
you're
attacking
in
this
case
is
any
different
than
the
rule
of
sight?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
anyway,
it's
against
the
rule.
do
you
think
--
do
you
think
the
rule
of
the
other
circuits
are
applied
and
there's
a
different
rule
that
is
applied
to
the
ninth
circuit?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
the
other
circuits
that
are
not
applying
the
rule
of
sight?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
how
about
your
opponent's
contention
that
the
rule
of
sight
is
--
was
approved
by
this
court
in
the
umbria?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
under
what
standard
they
applied
in
judging
the
(inaudible),
rule
of
sight
or
not?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now
how
does
the
share
equally
rule
work
now
if
there's
--?
if
the
barge
suffers
$10,000
damage
and
the
tanker
$50,000,
the
barge
pays
$25,000
of
your
damage
and
you
pay
$5000.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
the
way
it
works.
justice
william
j.
brennan,

what
were
the
relative
damages
here?
justice
william

what
were
the
relative
damages
to
the

justice
william

(voice

--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,

why
should
the
santa
maria
be
--?
would
it
be
justified
and
assuming
on
a
clear
day
that
the
tug
is
going
stay
on
its
side
of
the
river?
and
hence
the
santa
maria
maintained
its
speed
and
to
then
--
not
be
entitled
to
assume
that
if
there's
a
fact
--
if
the
tug
is
in
a
patch
of
fog.
and
what
--
what's
the
difference
there?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
wouldn't
say
that
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
santa
maria
would
have
been
negligent
at
all
--
if
--
if
on
a
clear
day,
she
maintained
her
full
speed
12
knots.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
it's
rather
unlikely
to
assume
the
tug
is
going
to
make
a
u-turn
though?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
this
case
proves
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
the
question
is
how
is
it
going
to
slow
down,
people
are
running
toward
the
rear
end
of
the
tug?
justice
william
j.
