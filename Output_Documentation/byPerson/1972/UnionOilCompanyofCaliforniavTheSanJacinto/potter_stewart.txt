it's

did

justice

well
you
might
have,
i

you
anticipated
the
possibility
of
a
reversal
and
i
just
wanted

if
you
said
and
if
--
if
the
judgment
is
reversed
in
any
--
in
any
event,
the
50-50
rule
should
not
be
applied.
of
course,
that's
the
rule
of
this
until
that
rule
is
changed
by
this
court.
i
suppose
the

would
have
not
listened

there

in
practical
fact,

the
rule

does
sometimes
have
strictly
applied,
it
would
sometimes
require
you
stop
an
anchor.

the
