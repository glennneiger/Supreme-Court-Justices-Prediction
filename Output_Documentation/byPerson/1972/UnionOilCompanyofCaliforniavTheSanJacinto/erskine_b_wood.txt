mr.
erskine
b.
wood
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
we
have
two
points
to
argue
here.
the
first
one
being
the
rule
of
navigation
and
i
agree
with
mr.
roberts.
i
think
there's
no
difference.
we're
just
applying
different
labels
to
the
same
rule
if
we
call
it
the
half-distance
rule
or
the
rule
of
sight.
and
that
rule
was
really
first
evolve
by
decisions
of
this
court
in
the
nacoochee
and
the
umbria
and
the
chattahoochee
and
the
rule
laid
down
was
that
in
a
fog
a
restricted
visibility,
a
ship
should
proceed
as
such
a
speed
as
would
enable
her
to
stop
in
time
to
avoid
collision
with
another
vessel
which
she
sees
emerge
from
the
fog.
mr.
erskine
b.
wood
no,
because
it
would
depend
upon
the
standard
visibility
in
the
fog.
if
he's
about
to
enter
a
fog
bank,
you
can
still
see
some
distance
into
the
fog.
i
mean,
the
line
of
the
fog
bank
is
not
a
--
a
solid
curtain
and
once
in
that,
you
should
certainly
slow
down
to
that
speed
as
you
approach
that
fog.
mr.
erskine
b.
wood
they're
pretty
dense
and
then
you
got
to
go
pretty
slowly.
mr.
erskine
b.
wood
it
was
patchy
fog,
but
the
tug
and
its
tow
for
a
time
were
completely
concealed
from
the
view
of
the
tanker
and
that
was
find
--
found
by
the
trial
court
and
the
ninth
circuit.
mr.
erskine
b.
wood
if
he
could
be
certain
that
the
tug
was
going
to
stay
where
it
was
or
maintain
the
same
course
and
speed
and
not
make
any
turns,
that's
the
difficulty.
mr.
erskine
b.
wood
it
might
be,
but
you
never
--
you
never
can
be
sure
what
you
--
what's
going
to
happen
when
you
can't
see
the
vessel
and
that's
why
radar
is
such
an
imperfection
and
why
we
have
so
many
collisions
despite
radar
that
the
courts
had
turn
the
coin
radar
assisted
collisions
because
they
see
only
the
spot
on
the
radar
but
they
can't
tell
the
course
and
speed
and
it
gives
a
misleading
sense
of
security.
and
as
in
the
andrea
doria,
stockholm
case
and
then
many
others,
the
ships
tend
to
steer
into
each
other
when
they
think
they're
steering
away
from
each
other.
mr.
erskine
b.
wood
if
there
had
been
no
fog
and
the
santa
maria
could
see
that
tug
at
all
times
with
the
visible
eye,
and
the
tug
made
a
u-turn
in
front
of
her
in
such
a
close
distance
that
the
santa
maria
could
not
avoid
collision,
i
would
think
that
it
would
be
the
tug's
fault
and
not
the
santa
maria's
fault.
but
what
we
have
mr.
--
mr.
erskine
b.
wood
absolutely.
mr.
erskine
b.
wood
that's
--
mr.
erskine
b.
wood
not
necessarily,
there
was
a
slight
bend
in
the
channel,
which
further
confused
--
mr.
erskine
b.
wood
caused
by
the
fog.
mr.
erskine
b.
wood
the
tug
in
fact
was
taking
an
in
extremis
action
because
of
the
fear
of
eminent
collision.
mr.
erskine
b.
wood
i
don't
think
this
really
has
anything
to
do
with
it.
we
are
not
contesting
fault
of
the
tug.
we
did
in
the
trial
court
level,
but
when
we
got
to
the
court
of
appeals,
we
were
only
trying
to
mutual
fault
on
the
sole
of
issue.
the
sole
issue
before
the
court
of
appeals
and
the
sole
issue
here
on
this
matter
of
navigation
is
why
is
that
santa
maria
going
in
excessive
speed
when
she
was
going
in
a
speed
of
seven
to
eight
knots?
she
knew
that
there
was
a
vessel
coming
down
meeting
her,
some
place
in
that
fog
which
she
couldn't
see
at
that
time
and
she
was
going
in
such
a
speed,
not
only
she
couldn't
stop
in
half
the
distance,
she
couldn't
stop
in
the
full
distance
because
when
she
first
sighted
that
tug
it
wasn't
right
angles
to
her
course.
and
of
course,
with
the
tug
ran
at
right
angles
to
her
course,
she
occupied
the
whole
distance
to
the
point
where
she
first
saw
it
and
she
was
still
going
from
four
to
seven
knots
at
the
point
of
collision.
she
was
going
way
over
the
speed
allowed
by
the
rule
of
sight.
and
i
want
to
point
out
that
the
rule
of
sight
is
a
rule
of
safety.
it's
a
rule
that
was
first
announced
by
this
court.
and
fog
as
gilmore
&
black
says,
“fog
is
the
ancient
terror
of
mariners.”
probably
fog
is
one
of
the
greatest
causes
of
ship
collisions
and
speed
in
the
fog
is
one
of
the
greatest
causes
of
ship
collisions
and
my
colleague
here
would
argue
that
we
shouldn't
have
any
standards
that
we
should
leave
everything
to
the
judgment
of
the
master.
i
think
that's
a
dangerous
--
mr.
erskine
b.
wood
well
--
mr.
erskine
b.
wood
the
difference
is
--
mr.
erskine
b.
wood
well,
i
think
the
differences
justice
--
mr.
justice
stewart
has
pointed
out,
the
very
fog
itself
lends
uncertainty
to
the
whole
situation.
the
very
fact
that
there
is
fog
creates
uncertainty
of
the
whole
situation.
if
you
have
a
bright
clear
day
and
you
see
the
tug
coming
down,
why
of
course
you
realize
that
the
tug
can
see
you
and
you're
both
going
to
stay
on
your
own
side.
but
when
you
have
fog,
you
don't
know
what
that
tug
is
likely
to
do
when
she
suddenly
sights
you
--
mr.
erskine
b.
wood
i
don't
think
you
can
be
certain
that
it
won't.
mr.
erskine
b.
wood
no.
you
have
to
--
one
thing
that's
a
little
different
with
the
tug
than
other
ships,
a
tug
can't
just
handle
the
situation
by
going
full
astern
because
it's
got
its
barge
comes
down
behind
it
and
that
produces
a
collision
with
its
own
barge.
the
tug
here
acted
in
extremis
because
of
the
confusion
of
the
fog.
i
think
the
fog
creates
much
greater
danger
than
vessels
meeting
on
a
clear
day
and
therefore,
i
don't
think
anyone
really
has
a
right
to
assume
anything.
there
are
certain
sanctions
you
can
make
but
above
all,
you've
got
keep
your
speed
within
what
the
law
of
a
statute
is,
the
statute,
article
16
says
moderate
speed
and
that
as
learned
hand
said
that
command
is
imperative,
how
the
courts
for
years
have
in
applying
that
statute
applied
an
interpretation
that
you
must
go
at
such
a
speed
that
you
can
stop
within
the
rule
of
sight.
mr.
erskine
b.
wood
if
the
tug
followed
the
rule
of
sight?
mr.
erskine
b.
wood
that
the
rule
of
sight
does
not
require
coming
to
a
complete
stop.
the
rule
of
sight
would
require
that
you
slow
down
enough
so
that
you
can
stop.
mr.
erskine
b.
wood
well,
then
the
tug
ought
to
be
going
pretty
slowly.
mr.
erskine
b.
wood
yes,
yes
it
would.
mr.
erskine
b.
wood
it
could.
that
brings
us
in
to
steerage
way,
mr.
erskine
b.
wood
well,
this
touches
on
--
on
this.
i
think
that
as
a
matter
of
common
sense
with
radar
now,
we
don't
apply
the
rule
of
sight
in
mid
ocean
where
you
have
no
radar
indication
of
another
ship
to
any
other
place.
mr.
erskine
b.
wood
yes.
mr.
erskine
b.
wood
i
do
not
push
this
rule
of
sight
to
the
extreme
that
in
the
middle
of
the
ocean
where
you
have
an
effective
radar
and
you
are
sure
that
there
are
no
other
vessels
in
the
area,
in
the
vicinity
at
all
that
you
have
to
at
all
times
hold
down
to
a
rule
of
sight
speed
but
this
get
--
i'm
trying
to
answer
justice
--
mr.
justice
rehnquist's
question.
when
you
are
in
harbor
waters,
inland
waters,
in
a
channel
such
as
the
(inaudible)
river,
there
you
are
expected
to
meet
other
vessels
and
your
radar
has
already
told
you
that
you
are
meeting
an
approaching
vessel.
therefore,
you
are
required
to
go
with
the
rule
of
sight
and
the
very
vessels
that
you
are
meeting
are
within
the
ambit
of
the
protection
of
that
duty
to
go
at
moderate
speed.
i
think
very
much
so
particularly
because
of
the
fog
which
creates
a
cloud
and
an
uncertainty
over
the
entire
navigation
as
the
very
reason
for
the
rule
of
sight.
mr.
erskine
b.
wood
i
think
it
would
be
a
little
unreasonable
to
say
it
couldn't
be
anticipated
at
all.
bear
in
mind
the
ships
are
meeting
at
a
band
in
the
channel
so
that
where
the
first
sighting
--
when
the
tug
first
sighted
the
lights
of
the
ship
they
were
dead
ahead
and
you
might
have
an
election
of
which
way
to
go.
i
think
it's
going
to
be
dangerous
to
try
to
pend
this
rule
of
sight
to
make
it
nonapplicable
in
fog
situations
where
the
other
vessels
hidden
from
the
fog
to
say,
“well,
we
had
the
right
to
assume
that
she
would
stay
on
her
side
or
something.”
i
think
you're
leading
to
hazards.
now
bear
in
mind
that
this
--
this
is
a
rule
of
safety
and
we're
talking
about
a
rule
that
may
affect
life.
i
mean
we're
talking
about
a
rule
where
ships
maybe
carrying
passengers
and
we
may
not
have
just
a
little
collision
like
this.
you
have
life
and
death
at
stake
in
here,
in
this
case.
i
think
that's
the
reason
that
courts
have
quite
uniformly
been
quite
strict
on
this
rule
of
sight.
now,
it
just
amazes
me
that
counsel
says
the
ninth
circuit
is
the
only
one
to
adhere
to
the
rule
of
sight.
gilmore
and
black
say
a
rule
of
thumb
often
applied
is
that
the
vessel
can
come
to
a
dead
stop
in
half
a
distance.
judge
learned
hand,
because
of
a
rule
that
everybody
knows
in
the
anglo-saxon
petroleum
company
case.
the
second
circuit
has
applied
it
over
and
over
again.
he
says
--
judge
learned
hand
says
on
article
16,
“only
requires
a
vessel
in
a
fog
to
"go
at
a
moderate
speed,"
as
everybody
knows,
the
courts
have
imposed
a
gloss
upon
this
that
"moderate
speed
is
that
at
which,
if
the
other
vessel
also
does
her
duty,
the
vessel
will
be
able
to
stop
her
way
before
they
collide.”
mr.
erskine
b.
wood
no,
they
all
follow
it.
mr.
erskine
b.
wood
oh,
i'd
like
to
talk
about
that.
mr.
erskine
b.
wood
yes.
yes
your
honor
it
did.
and
the
hess
shipping
allowed
an
exemption
of
bare
steerageway.
i
mean
that's
--
that's
all
it
did.
the
fifth
circuit
recognizes
the
rule
of
sight.
their
prior
decision
was
a
--
and
i
think
a
unanimous
decision
written
by
judge
john
brown,
an
experience
admiralty
practitioner,
and
that
was
the
antinous
case,
finlayson-forssa
against
pan
atlantic
and
i
cited
these
cases
on
the
brief
and
there
the
fifth
circuit
said,
“the
antinous
have
to
demonstrate
she
could
stop
in
one
half
of
distant
she
could
see.”
now,
that
was
the
rule
on
the
fifth
circuit.
hess
shipping
came
along
and
they
had
a
very
large
tanker
going
at
only
five
knots,
not
seven
or
eight.
and
the
testimony
was
if
she
couldn't
possibly
gone
any
slower
without
being
a
hazard
to
navigation,
it
was
--
it
ended
up
to
7
to
7
decision
and
you
denied
certiorari
and
the
exception
allowed
was
bare
steerageway
that
she
couldn't
have
slow
down
anymore.
mr.
erskine
b.
wood
she
could
have
dropped
her
anchor.
mr.
erskine
b.
wood
under
--
under
some
decisions,
yes.
i
think
the
pennsylvania
had
an
early
decision
by
this
court
so
said.
in
the
hess
shipping,
i
say
the
--
i
think
it
is
recognized
as
an
allowance
of
an
exception
of
bare
steerageway.
now,
they
cannot
petition
or
cannot
escape
under
that
umbrella
in
this
case.
they
were
going
well
and
excessive
bare
steerageway.
the
santa
maria
had
three
basic
speeds,
full,
half,
and
slow.
and
as
the
court
of
appeals
opinion
says,
“she
didn't
show
that
she
could
have
gone
slower.”
and
my
brief
on
page
23
specifically
covers
this,
approach
the
testimony
that
her
helmsman,
the
man
--
the
very
man
steering
the
ship
who
got
22
years
experience.
he
said
it
steered
good
and
steered
just
as
well
at
slow
speed
as
in
half
or
full.
question,
“is
it
more
difficult
to
hold
an
exact
course
when
you're
going
a
slow
speed?”
answer,
“i
don't
find
it,
so
no,
if
you
give
it
enough
wheel,
she
will
hold
her
course
real
good.”
later
on
question,
“does
it
make
any
difference
whether
you're
going
full
speed,
half
speed,
or
slow
speed
and
fully
loaded?”
answer,
“not
if
you
give
it
enough
wheel,
it
does
make
any
difference.”
mr.
erskine
b.
wood
i
think
so.
mr.
erskine
b.
wood
of
course
the
burden
is
on
her
under
the
pennsylvania
rule
but
they
pretty
nearly
missed
and
there
is
quite
a
difference
in
momentum
between
five
and
seven.
i'm
not
an
expert
on
ballistics
but
her
momentum,
but
it
seems
to
me
there's
something
about
weight
times
speed
and
so
forth
and
i
think
it
goes
up
pretty
rapidly.
i
think
at
five
knots,
you
can
come
to
a
slower
speed
or
a
reduced
speed
a
lot
quicker
than
you
can
at
seven
or
eight
knots.
and
i
think
at
five
knots
when
she
went
--
if
she
had
gone
full
astern
immediately,
she
would
have
checked
her
head
way
enough
that
the
barge
would
have
swam
clear.
in
any
way,
in
any
event,
the
burden
is
on
her
to
establish
that
under
the
pennsylvania
rule
because
she
has
committed
a
statutory
violation.
her
burden
has
to
show
not
only
that
her
fault
did
not
cause
the
collision
but
could
not
have
caused
the
collision.
mr.
erskine
b.
wood
yes,
mr.
justice
powell,
i
think
that's
perhaps
another
way
of
stating
the
pennsylvania
rule.
when
she
violates
the
rule
of
sight,
she
is
considered
to
have
committed
the
statutory
violation
which
puts
on
her
the
burden
of
proving
not
only
that
this
violation
didn't
cause
the
accident
but
couldn't
have
caused
it
and
therefore,
if
she
fails
to
prove
that,
she's
held
condemned
on
that
ground.
i
think
it's
just
another
way
of
stating
the
pennsylvania
rule.
in
other
words,
it's
a
presumption
that
she
has
caused
the
--
contributed
to
the
collision
and
in
this
case,
she
didn't
put
on
any
evidence
to
it
that
the
collision
still
would
have
occurred
and
really
couldn't.
i
think
this
--
i
just
merely
want
to
say
that
we
have
no
conflict
here
with
the
fact
that
you
consider
the
circumstances
because
of
course
when
you're
determining
whether
your
speed
is
--
you
can
stop
in
half
a
distance.
all
of
the
circumstances
come
into
play
whether
you're
fully
loaded
and
have
more
momentum
because
of
your
weight
or
whether
you're
light,
whether
you
have
a
headwind,
whether
you've
got
quick
reversing
engines
or
slower
reversing
engines,
whether
you've
got
a
headwind
or
a
tailwind,
everything
--
all
those
circumstances
come
into
play
and
it
doesn't
take
any
slide
rule
of
calculation
as
my
brother
would
say
anymore
than
when
you're
driving
a
car
down
a
highway
in
a
thick
fog,
it's
probably
a
pretty
prudent
thing
to
do
to
not
go
at
such
speed
that
you
can't
stop
within
the
rule
of
sight
because
there
might
be
a
broken
down
automobile
in
the
middle
of
road
ahead
on
you.
now
when
you're
driving
down
the
highway
in
a
dense
fog
is
probably
a
pretty
good
thing
to
not
exceed
the
speed
that
you
can
see
ahead
in
the
fog,
at
least
i
normally,
if
i'm
not
to
go
or
in
that
at
least
to
which
i
can
see
lights.
so,
i
think
it's
a
rule
of
common
sense.
i
think
the
court
of
appeals'
decision
on
this
point
when
read
carefully
is
probably
the
best
brief
that
one
could
write
for
upholding
the
rule
of
sight.
this
brings
me
the
point
of
damages
and
division
of
damages
and
i
would
less
likely
--
i'll
very
briefly
sketch
the
history
on
this.
some
120
years
ago,
of
course
this
court
announced
that
in
mutual
fault
cases
damages
are
divided
equally
and
that
is
continued
to
be
the
rule.
the
same
rule
was
applied
in
england
for
years
and
years
and
years
and
then
it
was
actually
made
statutory,
this
i
do
not
have
all
this
in
mind.
i
didn't
put
in
the
brief
but
the
english
--
i
can't
say
it
--
act
of
some
1873,
the
50/50
rule
is
made
statutory.
then
in
1910,
we
had
the
brussels
convention
which
adapted
proportional
fault
but
also
did
a
lot
of
other
things
and
governed
the
relations
with
cargo,
the
obligations
toward
cargo.
now,
we
come
with
the
legislative
history
in
the
united
states
and
brussels
convention
was
submitted
to
the
senate
in
1937
and
it
sat
here
for
10
years
and
there
wasn't
much
action
during
the
war
but
it
remained
here
after
the
war
but
after
a
10-year
period
when
no
action
was
taken
--
taken
on
it,
it
was
withdrawn.
then
in
1962
in
the
87th
congress,
they
put
in
a
senate
bill
2313
and
h.r.
in
the
house
7911
and
those
finally
died
on
the
floor.
they
were
reported
on
a
committee
but
they
died
on
the
floor.
then
the
next
year
in
1963,
i
do
not
include
this
in
my
brief
unfortunately.
i
didn't
have
all
the
legislative
history
research
facilities
in
portland
and
i
check
this
out
with
the
congressional
library
here.
but
in
the
88th
congress,
again
two
bills
were
introduced,
s.555
and
h.r.
1070
but
those
bills
again
were
to
provide
for
proportional
fault
and
to
really
enact
the
substance
of
brussels
and
they
never
got
out
of
committee,
never
got
out
of
subcommittee.
now,
so
much
for
the
past
history,
this
court
although
was
a
personal
injury
case
that
reiterated
in
halcyon,
the
rule
that
the
collision
cases
that's
50/50
and
as
recently
as
1963
in
weyerhaeuser
versus
united
states,
a
unanimous
decision
opinion
written
by
mr.
justice
potter
again,
referred
to
the
rule
that
we
have
here
a
rule
which
is
work
with
the
--
i
don't
want
to
miss
quote
it.
it's
in
my
brief
but
anyway,
recondition
was
paid
to
the
rule
in
1963
that
in
collision
case,
it's
always
50/50.
now,
briefly
on
the
merits
of
this
rule
versus
proportional
fault,
it
--
contrary
to
what
my
colleague
says,
i'm
sure
that
it
promotes
settlements.
i
think
from
my
experience
--
mr.
erskine
b.
wood
it
certainly
eliminates
one
issue.
i
think
experienced
lawyers
sitting
across
the
table
will
recognize
--
well,
there
were
some
fault
here
and
there
are
some
fault
there
and
we
settle
50/50.
in
my
own
experience
of
30
years,
i
have
never
tried
a
major
--
you
know
a
big
half
million,
million
or
two
million
dollar
collision
case.
i
settled
many
of
them
and
i
don't
know
one
in
which
i
didn't
say,
“your
ship
was
a
lot
more
at
fault
than
ours,”
and
the
other
fellow
was
saying,
“your
ship
was
a
lot
more
at
fault.”
but
when
you
get
all
through
arguing,
you
have
to
admit
that
there
was
some
fault
on
both
sides
and
you
settle
at
50/50.
now,
the
andrea
doria,
stockholm
which
was
probably
one
of
the
major
collisions
with
most
money
involved
never
--
i
don't
believe
it
was
ever
tried
in
the
district
court.
it
was
an
ultimate
settlement.
these
cases
have
uniformly
been
settled
and
it's
a
pretty
practical
rule
because
as
my
colleague's
brief
points
out,
you've
got
mostly
whole
insurance
companies
on
both
sides
of
these
things
and
maybe
they
lose
a
little
here
but
they
evens
up
with
the
next
case.
maybe
in
one
case,
they
thought
they
should
have
come
two
thirds,
one-third
but
next
case
is
the
other
way
and
they're
all
settled
50/50.
now,
for
just
for
a
moment
on
the
burden
that
this
might
place
on
the
courts,
not
only
do
i
think
that
if
you
have
a
proportional
fault
rule,
each
side
is
going
to
say,
“your
ship
is
more
at
fault.”
“no,
yours
is
more
at
fault,”
that
you're
going
to
litigate
but
you're
going
make
the
trials
much
longer
because
it's
going
to
get
to
be
a
game
of
points.
now,
if
i
can
just
prove
that
you
violated
the
rule
of
sight,
you
were
going
too
fast
in
fog,
that's
all
i
have
to
prove.
but
if
we
get
to
proportional
fault,
i
want
to
prove
that
he
was
not
keeping
a
proper
look
out
on
the
bow,
that
he
wasn't
lowering
his
danger
signals,
he
wasn't
lowering
his
fog
signals.
they
turn
port
when
it
should
have
gone
starboard.
his
radar
watch
was
inadequate
and
i
am
going
to
try
to
build
that
about
10
points
so
that
if
he
proves
a
couple
of
good
points
against
me,
i've
still
got
an
8020.
i
think
you're
going
to
have
your
trials
to
get
to
be
sort
of
a
game
of
points
and
trials
are
going
to
be
a
lot
long.
now,
brussels
convention,
very
frankly,
i
handily
with
the
court,
i
favor
brussels
convention
in
toto
but
i
don't
think
--
i
think
it
would
be
a
great
mistake
to
try
to
change
--
to
adapt
what
rule
of
proportional
fault
which
is
kind
of
a
piece
meal
adaption
of
brussels
convention.
remember
that
brussels
convention
also
regulates
the
obligations
toward
cargo,
and
this
is
very
important
to
this
case
to
understand
the
ship
owner's
obligations
toward
cargo
because
every
major
collision
case
or
almost
everyone,
you
have
inextricably
involved
with
the
cross
liabilities
between
two
ship
owners.
you
have
their
obligations
toward
cargo.
now,
historically
--
mr.
erskine
b.
wood
we
can
do
it
tomorrow.
mr.
erskine
b.
wood
of
course.
mr.
erskine
b.
wood
let's
talk
about
it
from
time-to-time.
there
is
nothing
to
prevent
it.
i
--
i
am
sure
that
if
there
was
enough
interest
and
enough
push
in
this
thing
that
if
people
really
wanted
the
50/50
rule
of
change
--
mr.
erskine
b.
wood
insurance
companies,
steamship
owners,
cargo
owners,
people
if
they
wanted
to
get
a
law
pass,
there
wouldn't
be
any
great
problem
about
it.
mr.
erskine
b.
wood
sure,
i'd
love
it.
mr.
erskine
b.
wood
you
say
it's
been
before
congress,
yes
--
mr.
erskine
b.
wood
--
since
1937.
mr.
erskine
b.
wood
i
believe
not,
mr.
chief
justice.
the
first
that
i
have
found
that
it
was
presented
was
1937
which
all
it
was
originally
adapted
1910
but
i
think
it
--
we
have
to
allow
25
years
in
order
to
be
adapted
by
a
lot
of
the
other
maritime
nations
and
then
when
they
got
to
be
pretty
uniformly
adapted
by
the
other
maritime
nations,
they
made
to
push
to
have
it
done
here.
they
never
took
hold
of
them.
now,
i
want
to
explain
this
matter
of
cargo.
you
see
the
cargo
on
the
carrier.
it's
important
to
distinguish
between
the
carrying
vessel
which
carries
the
cargo
and
a
non-carrying
vessel.
for
many
years
under
acts
of
congress,
the
harter
act,
carriage
of
goods
by
sea
act,
we
call
it
cogsa.
cargo
has
not
right
to
recover
against
its
own
ship,
the
carrying
ship,
for
negligent
navigation
which
is
involved
in
collisions
but
cargo
has
always
had
the
right
to
recover
a
100%
against
the
non-carrying
vessel.
now
--
so
that's
what
happens.
cargo
gets
100%
of
its
recovery
against
the
non-carrying
vessel
and
under
the
50/50
rule
a
non-carrying
vessel
then
includes
its
payment
to
cargo
in
its
damages
and
gets
them
back
from
the
--
and
gets
50%
back
from
the
carrying
vessels.
so
indirectly,
the
carrying
vessel
ends
up
paying
50%
of
the
damage
to
its
own
cargo
but
no
more.
they
used
to
try
to
devise
bill
of
lading
clauses
to
get
around
that
but
in
the
united
states
against
the
atlantic
mutual,
this
court
held
those
bill
of
lading
clauses
void
as
against
public
policy.
so
the
law
is
well
settled
that
the
innocent
cargo
recovers
a
100%
against
the
non-carrying
vessel
which
in
turn
gets
50%
back
from
the
carrying
vessel.
but
now,
if
you
were
to
adapt
piecemeal,
an
extract
out
of
brussels
convention,
a
rule
of
proportional
fault,
look
at
the
result.
he
would
create
innocent
cargo
on
the
carrying
vessel.
and
let's
assume
the
carrying
vessel
is
90%
to
blame
and
non-carrying
vessel
is
10%.
the
innocent
cargo
gets
a
100%
of
its
damages
against
that
10%
to
blame
non-carrying
ship.
that
ship
in
turn,
under
proportional
fault,
we
get
90%
of
the
damages
back
from
the
carrying
vessel.
so
you
have
the
carrying
vessel
which
congress
under
harter
act
in
cogsa
says
it's
not
responsible
for
damage
to
the
cargo
due
to
negligent
navigation
as
being
indirectly
held
for
90%
of
the
damage.
now
this
does
two
things.
number
one,
it
pushes
us
a
lot
further
away
from
the
law
of
other
nations.
if
is
--
if
we're
trying
to
achieve
uniformity,
let's
try
to
get
some
uniformity
on
maritime
law
with
england
and
japan
and
italy
and
germany.
but
here,
we'd
be
pushing
to
think
further
from
uniformity
because
here
you
create
situations
where
cargo
would
end
up
with
a
90%
recovery
from
its
own
vessel
and
under
the
law
of
all
other
maritime
nations,
cargo
cannot
recover
from
its
own
vessel
and
its
recovery
against
the
non-carrying
ship
is
not
a
100%
but
it
is
such
percentage
is
that
non-carrying
vessel
is
at
fault.
not
only
the
--
create
habit
with
uniformity
but
you
open
the
door
at
least
you
create
an
atmosphere
where
--
which
is
an
invitation
to
collision.
a
ship
carrying
a
valuable
cargo,
we
say
a
million
dollars
of
cargo
damage
and
maybe
there's
only
100,000
scattered
damage
to
the
wholes
of
the
two
ships,
like
she
is
going
to
come,
if
she
is
pretty
much
to
blame,
she
is
going
to
come
in
and
try
to
admit
sole
blame
and
say,
“i'm
100%
at
fault.
that
other
ship
was
free
and
clear,”
and
shape
a
witness's
testimony
that
way
because
if
she
is
a
100%
to
blame,
she
doesn't
have
to
pay
any
cargo
damage.
the
cargo
can't
recover
against
the
other
ship
--
excuse
me.
yeah,
if
she
is
a
100
--
if
a
carrying
vessel
is
a
100%
to
blame
that
presupposes
that
the
non-carrying
vessel
has
no
fault
so
cargo
gets
nothing.
and
so,
with
the
million
dollar
cargo
damage
and
ships,
maybe
100,000
whole
of
damage,
why
--
the
ship
is
going
to
throw
the
case
if
it
can
do
so
gracefully
and
escape
that
million
dollar
liability
even
though
it
might
pick
up
the
$100,000
tab.
i
think
it
opens
the
door
to
collision
that
leads
to
ridiculous
results
as
far
as
the
forum
shopping.
i'd
never
seen
any
great
--
amount
of
forum
shopping
on
this.
i
don't
think
it
exists
and
when
the
collisions
are
on
--
in
the
waters,
of
course
they're
controlled
by
the
law
of
the
place
and
forum
shopping
doesn't
do
you
any
good.
i
submit
that
the
rule
shouldn't
conclude
by
saying
that
the
rule
is
a
workable
rule.
we've
had
it
for
100
years.
we
don't
have
the
reason
for
change
here
that
you
had
in
(inaudible)
in
(inaudible),
that
involving
death
on
inland
waters,
we
had
utter
chaos
in
the
maritime
field
and
substantive
right
of
recovery
for
death
because
you
relegated
the
suitor
to
the
state
death
statute
which
varied
from
state
to
state,
in
some
places
there
was
a
bar
in
other
places
which
proportionately
--
in
all
kinds
of
nonuniform
results.
we
don't
have
the
reason
for
trying
to
make
new
law
or
changing
the
law
that
you
had
in
(inaudible)
and
in
view
of
the
legislative
history,
i
think
this
thing
should
be
straightened
up
by
congress
and
i
agree
with
--
i
believe
it
was
mr.
justice
rehnquist's
absence
of
briefs
amicus
here
and
the
absence
of
any
recent
efforts
in
congress
shows
that
everybody
is
pretty
well
satisfied
with
this
50/50
rule.
it's
a
good
work
for
a
rule.
mr.
erskine
b.
wood
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
we
have
two
points
to
argue
here.
the
first
one
being
the
rule
of
navigation
and
i
agree
with
mr.
roberts.
i
think
there's
no
difference.
we're
just
applying
different
labels
to
the
same
rule
if
we
call
it
the
half-distance
rule
or
the
rule
of
sight.
and
that
rule
was
really
first
evolve
by
decisions
of
this
court
in
the
nacoochee
and
the
umbria
and
the
chattahoochee
and
the
rule
laid
down
was
that
in
a
fog
a
restricted
visibility,
a
ship
should
proceed
as
such
a
speed
as
would
enable
her
to
stop
in
time
to
avoid
collision
with
another
vessel
which
she
sees
emerge
from
the
fog.
mr.
erskine
b.
wood
no,
because
it
would
depend
upon
the
standard
visibility
in
the
fog.
if
he's
about
to
enter
a
fog
bank,
you
can
still
see
some
distance
into
the
fog.
i
mean,
the
line
of
the
fog
bank
is
not
a
--
a
solid
curtain
and
once
in
that,
you
should
certainly
slow
down
to
that
speed
as
you
approach
that
fog.
mr.
erskine
b.
wood
they're
pretty
dense
and
then
you
got
to
go
pretty
slowly.
mr.
erskine
b.
wood
it
was
patchy
fog,
but
the
tug
and
its
tow
for
a
time
were
completely
concealed
from
the
view
of
the
tanker
and
that
was
find
--
found
by
the
trial
court
and
the
ninth
circuit.
mr.
erskine
b.
wood
if
he
could
be
certain
that
the
tug
was
going
to
stay
where
it
was
or
maintain
the
same
course
and
speed
and
not
make
any
turns,
that's
the
difficulty.
mr.
erskine
b.
wood
it
might
be,
but
you
never
--
you
never
can
be
sure
what
you
--
what's
going
to
happen
when
you
can't
see
the
vessel
and
that's
why
radar
is
such
an
imperfection
and
why
we
have
so
many
collisions
despite
radar
that
the
courts
had
turn
the
coin
radar
assisted
collisions
because
they
see
only
the
spot
on
the
radar
but
they
can't
tell
the
course
and
speed
and
it
gives
a
misleading
sense
of
security.
and
as
in
the
andrea
doria,
stockholm
case
and
then
many
others,
the
ships
tend
to
steer
into
each
other
when
they
think
they're
steering
away
from
each
other.
mr.
erskine
b.
wood
if
there
had
been
no
fog
and
the
santa
maria
could
see
that
tug
at
all
times
with
the
visible
eye,
and
the
tug
made
a
u-turn
in
front
of
her
in
such
a
close
distance
that
the
santa
maria
could
not
avoid
collision,
i
would
think
that
it
would
be
the
tug's
fault
and
not
the
santa
maria's
fault.
but
what
we
have
mr.
--
mr.
erskine
b.
wood
absolutely.
mr.
erskine
b.
wood
that's
--
mr.
erskine
b.
wood
not
necessarily,
there
was
a
slight
bend
in
the
channel,
which
further
confused
--
mr.
erskine
b.
wood
caused
by
the
fog.
mr.
erskine
b.
wood
the
tug
in
fact
was
taking
an
in
extremis
action
because
of
the
fear
of
eminent
collision.
mr.
erskine
b.
wood
i
don't
think
this
really
has
anything
to
do
with
it.
we
are
not
contesting
fault
of
the
tug.
we
did
in
the
trial
court
level,
but
when
we
got
to
the
court
of
appeals,
we
were
only
trying
to
mutual
fault
on
the
sole
of
issue.
the
sole
issue
before
the
court
of
appeals
and
the
sole
issue
here
on
this
matter
of
navigation
is
why
is
that
santa
maria
going
in
excessive
speed
when
she
was
going
in
a
speed
of
seven
to
eight
knots?
she
knew
that
there
was
a
vessel
coming
down
meeting
her,
some
place
in
that
fog
which
she
couldn't
see
at
that
time
and
she
was
going
in
such
a
speed,
not
only
she
couldn't
stop
in
half
the
distance,
she
couldn't
stop
in
the
full
distance
because
when
she
first
sighted
that
tug
it
wasn't
right
angles
to
her
course.
and
of
course,
with
the
tug
ran
at
right
angles
to
her
course,
she
occupied
the
whole
distance
to
the
point
where
she
first
saw
it
and
she
was
still
going
from
four
to
seven
knots
at
the
point
of
collision.
she
was
going
way
over
the
speed
allowed
by
the
rule
of
sight.
and
i
want
to
point
out
that
the
rule
of
sight
is
a
rule
of
safety.
it's
a
rule
that
was
first
announced
by
this
court.
and
fog
as
gilmore
&
black
says,
“fog
is
the
ancient
terror
of
mariners.”
probably
fog
is
one
of
the
greatest
causes
of
ship
collisions
and
speed
in
the
fog
is
one
of
the
greatest
causes
of
ship
collisions
and
my
colleague
here
would
argue
that
we
shouldn't
have
any
standards
that
we
should
leave
everything
to
the
judgment
of
the
master.
i
think
that's
a
dangerous
--
mr.
erskine
b.
wood
well
--
mr.
erskine
b.
wood
the
difference
is
--
mr.
erskine
b.
wood
well,
i
think
the
differences
justice
--
mr.
justice
stewart
has
pointed
out,
the
very
fog
itself
lends
uncertainty
to
the
whole
situation.
the
very
fact
that
there
is
fog
creates
uncertainty
of
the
whole
situation.
if
you
have
a
bright
clear
day
and
you
see
the
tug
coming
down,
why
of
course
you
realize
that
the
tug
can
see
you
and
you're
both
going
to
stay
on
your
own
side.
but
when
you
have
fog,
you
don't
know
what
that
tug
is
likely
to
do
when
she
suddenly
sights
you
--
mr.
erskine
b.
wood
i
don't
think
you
can
be
certain
that
it
won't.
mr.
erskine
b.
wood
no.
you
have
to
--
one
thing
that's
a
little
different
with
the
tug
than
other
ships,
a
tug
can't
just
handle
the
situation
by
going
full
astern
because
it's
got
its
barge
comes
down
behind
it
and
that
produces
a
collision
with
its
own
barge.
the
tug
here
acted
in
extremis
because
of
the
confusion
of
the
fog.
i
think
the
fog
creates
much
greater
danger
than
vessels
meeting
on
a
clear
day
and
therefore,
i
don't
think
anyone
really
has
a
right
to
assume
anything.
there
are
certain
sanctions
you
can
make
but
above
all,
you've
got
keep
your
speed
within
what
the
law
of
a
statute
is,
the
statute,
article
16
says
moderate
speed
and
that
as
learned
hand
said
that
command
is
imperative,
how
the
courts
for
years
have
in
applying
that
statute
applied
an
interpretation
that
you
must
go
at
such
a
speed
that
you
can
stop
within
the
rule
of
sight.
mr.
erskine
b.
wood
if
the
tug
followed
the
rule
of
sight?
mr.
erskine
b.
wood
that
the
rule
of
sight
does
not
require
coming
to
a
complete
stop.
the
rule
of
sight
would
require
that
you
slow
down
enough
so
that
you
can
stop.
mr.
erskine
b.
wood
well,
then
the
tug
ought
to
be
going
pretty
slowly.
mr.
erskine
b.
wood
yes,
yes
it
would.
mr.
erskine
b.
wood
it
could.
that
brings
us
in
to
steerage
way,
mr.
erskine
b.
wood
well,
this
touches
on
--
on
this.
i
think
that
as
a
matter
of
common
sense
with
radar
now,
we
don't
apply
the
rule
of
sight
in
mid
ocean
where
you
have
no
radar
indication
of
another
ship
to
any
other
place.
mr.
erskine
b.
wood
yes.
mr.
erskine
b.
wood
i
do
not
push
this
rule
of
sight
to
the
extreme
that
in
the
middle
of
the
ocean
where
you
have
an
effective
radar
and
you
are
sure
that
there
are
no
other
vessels
in
the
area,
in
the
vicinity
at
all
that
you
have
to
at
all
times
hold
down
to
a
rule
of
sight
speed
but
this
get
--
i'm
trying
to
answer
justice
--
mr.
justice
rehnquist's
question.
when
you
are
in
harbor
waters,
inland
waters,
in
a
channel
such
as
the
(inaudible)
river,
there
you
are
expected
to
meet
other
vessels
and
your
radar
has
already
told
you
that
you
are
meeting
an
approaching
vessel.
therefore,
you
are
required
to
go
with
the
rule
of
sight
and
the
very
vessels
that
you
are
meeting
are
within
the
ambit
of
the
protection
of
that
duty
to
go
at
moderate
speed.
i
think
very
much
so
particularly
because
of
the
fog
which
creates
a
cloud
and
an
uncertainty
over
the
entire
navigation
as
the
very
reason
for
the
rule
of
sight.
mr.
erskine
b.
wood
i
think
it
would
be
a
little
unreasonable
to
say
it
couldn't
be
anticipated
at
all.
bear
in
mind
the
ships
are
meeting
at
a
band
in
the
channel
so
that
where
the
first
sighting
--
when
the
tug
first
sighted
the
lights
of
the
ship
they
were
dead
ahead
and
you
might
have
an
election
of
which
way
to
go.
i
think
it's
going
to
be
dangerous
to
try
to
pend
this
rule
of
sight
to
make
it
nonapplicable
in
fog
situations
where
the
other
vessels
hidden
from
the
fog
to
say,
“well,
we
had
the
right
to
assume
that
she
would
stay
on
her
side
or
something.”
i
think
you're
leading
to
hazards.
now
bear
in
mind
that
this
--
this
is
a
rule
of
safety
and
we're
talking
about
a
rule
that
may
affect
life.
i
mean
we're
talking
about
a
rule
where
ships
maybe
carrying
passengers
and
we
may
not
have
just
a
little
collision
like
this.
you
have
life
and
death
at
stake
in
here,
in
this
case.
i
think
that's
the
reason
that
courts
have
quite
uniformly
been
quite
strict
on
this
rule
of
sight.
now,
it
just
amazes
me
that
counsel
says
the
ninth
circuit
is
the
only
one
to
adhere
to
the
rule
of
sight.
gilmore
and
black
say
a
rule
of
thumb
often
applied
is
that
the
vessel
can
come
to
a
dead
stop
in
half
a
distance.
judge
learned
hand,
because
of
a
rule
that
everybody
knows
in
the
anglo-saxon
petroleum
company
case.
the
second
circuit
has
applied
it
over
and
over
again.
he
says
--
judge
learned
hand
says
on
article
16,
“only
requires
a
vessel
in
a
fog
to
"go
at
a
moderate
speed,"
as
everybody
knows,
the
courts
have
imposed
a
gloss
upon
this
that
"moderate
speed
is
that
at
which,
if
the
other
vessel
also
does
her
duty,
the
vessel
will
be
able
to
stop
her
way
before
they
collide.”
mr.
erskine
b.
wood
no,
they
all
follow
it.
mr.
erskine
b.
wood
oh,
i'd
like
to
talk
about
that.
mr.
erskine
b.
wood
yes.
yes
your
honor
it
did.
and
the
hess
shipping
allowed
an
exemption
of
bare
steerageway.
i
mean
that's
--
that's
all
it
did.
the
fifth
circuit
recognizes
the
rule
of
sight.
their
prior
decision
was
a
--
and
i
think
a
unanimous
decision
written
by
judge
john
brown,
an
experience
admiralty
practitioner,
and
that
was
the
antinous
case,
finlayson-forssa
against
pan
atlantic
and
i
cited
these
cases
on
the
brief
and
there
the
fifth
circuit
said,
“the
antinous
have
to
demonstrate
she
could
stop
in
one
half
of
distant
she
could
see.”
now,
that
was
the
rule
on
the
fifth
circuit.
hess
shipping
came
along
and
they
had
a
very
large
tanker
going
at
only
five
knots,
not
seven
or
eight.
and
the
testimony
was
if
she
couldn't
possibly
gone
any
slower
without
being
a
hazard
to
navigation,
it
was
--
it
ended
up
to
7
to
7
decision
and
you
denied
certiorari
and
the
exception
allowed
was
bare
steerageway
that
she
couldn't
have
slow
down
anymore.
mr.
erskine
b.
wood
she
could
have
dropped
her
anchor.
mr.
erskine
b.
wood
under
--
under
some
decisions,
yes.
i
think
the
pennsylvania
had
an
early
decision
by
this
court
so
said.
in
the
hess
shipping,
i
say
the
--
i
think
it
is
recognized
as
an
allowance
of
an
exception
of
bare
steerageway.
now,
they
cannot
petition
or
cannot
escape
under
that
umbrella
in
this
case.
they
were
going
well
and
excessive
bare
steerageway.
the
santa
maria
had
three
basic
speeds,
full,
half,
and
slow.
and
as
the
court
of
appeals
opinion
says,
“she
didn't
show
that
she
could
have
gone
slower.”
and
my
brief
on
page
23
specifically
covers
this,
approach
the
testimony
that
her
helmsman,
the
man
--
the
very
man
steering
the
ship
who
got
22
years
experience.
he
said
it
steered
good
and
steered
just
as
well
at
slow
speed
as
in
half
or
full.
question,
“is
it
more
difficult
to
hold
an
exact
course
when
you're
going
a
slow
speed?”
answer,
“i
don't
find
it,
so
no,
if
you
give
it
enough
wheel,
she
will
hold
her
course
real
good.”
later
on
question,
“does
it
make
any
difference
whether
you're
going
full
speed,
half
speed,
or
slow
speed
and
fully
loaded?”
answer,
“not
if
you
give
it
enough
wheel,
it
does
make
any
difference.”
mr.
erskine
b.
wood
i
think
so.
mr.
erskine
b.
wood
of
course
the
burden
is
on
her
under
the
pennsylvania
rule
but
they
pretty
nearly
missed
and
there
is
quite
a
difference
in
momentum
between
five
and
seven.
i'm
not
an
expert
on
ballistics
but
her
momentum,
but
it
seems
to
me
there's
something
about
weight
times
speed
and
so
forth
and
i
think
it
goes
up
pretty
rapidly.
i
think
at
five
knots,
you
can
come
to
a
slower
speed
or
a
reduced
speed
a
lot
quicker
than
you
can
at
seven
or
eight
knots.
and
i
think
at
five
knots
when
she
went
--
if
she
had
gone
full
astern
immediately,
she
would
have
checked
her
head
way
enough
that
the
barge
would
have
swam
clear.
in
any
way,
in
any
event,
the
burden
is
on
her
to
establish
that
under
the
pennsylvania
rule
because
she
has
committed
a
statutory
violation.
her
burden
has
to
show
not
only
that
her
fault
did
not
cause
the
collision
but
could
not
have
caused
the
collision.
mr.
erskine
b.
wood
yes,
mr.
justice
powell,
i
think
that's
perhaps
another
way
of
stating
the
pennsylvania
rule.
when
she
violates
the
rule
of
sight,
she
is
considered
to
have
committed
the
statutory
violation
which
puts
on
her
the
burden
of
proving
not
only
that
this
violation
didn't
cause
the
accident
but
couldn't
have
caused
it
and
therefore,
if
she
fails
to
prove
that,
she's
held
condemned
on
that
ground.
i
think
it's
just
another
way
of
stating
the
pennsylvania
rule.
in
other
words,
it's
a
presumption
that
she
has
caused
the
--
contributed
to
the
collision
and
in
this
case,
she
didn't
put
on
any
evidence
to
it
that
the
collision
still
would
have
occurred
and
really
couldn't.
i
think
this
--
i
just
merely
want
to
say
that
we
have
no
conflict
here
with
the
fact
that
you
consider
the
circumstances
because
of
course
when
you're
determining
whether
your
speed
is
--
you
can
stop
in
half
a
distance.
all
of
the
circumstances
come
into
play
whether
you're
fully
loaded
and
have
more
momentum
because
of
your
weight
or
whether
you're
light,
whether
you
have
a
headwind,
whether
you've
got
quick
reversing
engines
or
slower
reversing
engines,
whether
you've
got
a
headwind
or
a
tailwind,
everything
--
all
those
circumstances
come
into
play
and
it
doesn't
take
any
slide
rule
of
calculation
as
my
brother
would
say
anymore
than
when
you're
driving
a
car
down
a
highway
in
a
thick
fog,
it's
probably
a
pretty
prudent
thing
to
do
to
not
go
at
such
speed
that
you
can't
stop
within
the
rule
of
sight
because
there
might
be
a
broken
down
automobile
in
the
middle
of
road
ahead
on
you.
now
when
you're
driving
down
the
highway
in
a
dense
fog
is
probably
a
pretty
good
thing
to
not
exceed
the
speed
that
you
can
see
ahead
in
the
fog,
at
least
i
normally,
if
i'm
not
to
go
or
in
that
at
least
to
which
i
can
see
lights.
so,
i
think
it's
a
rule
of
common
sense.
i
think
the
court
of
appeals'
decision
on
this
point
when
read
carefully
is
probably
the
best
brief
that
one
could
write
for
upholding
the
rule
of
sight.
this
brings
me
the
point
of
damages
and
division
of
damages
and
i
would
less
likely
--
i'll
very
briefly
sketch
the
history
on
this.
some
120
years
ago,
of
course
this
court
announced
that
in
mutual
fault
cases
damages
are
divided
equally
and
that
is
continued
to
be
the
rule.
the
same
rule
was
applied
in
england
for
years
and
years
and
years
and
then
it
was
actually
made
statutory,
this
i
do
not
have
all
this
in
mind.
i
didn't
put
in
the
brief
but
the
english
--
i
can't
say
it
--
act
of
some
1873,
the
50/50
rule
is
made
statutory.
then
in
1910,
we
had
the
brussels
convention
which
adapted
proportional
fault
but
also
did
a
lot
of
other
things
and
governed
the
relations
with
cargo,
the
obligations
toward
cargo.
now,
we
come
with
the
legislative
history
in
the
united
states
and
brussels
convention
was
submitted
to
the
senate
in
1937
and
it
sat
here
for
10
years
and
there
wasn't
much
action
during
the
war
but
it
remained
here
after
the
war
but
after
a
10-year
period
when
no
action
was
taken
--
taken
on
it,
it
was
withdrawn.
then
in
1962
in
the
87th
congress,
they
put
in
a
senate
bill
2313
and
h.r.
in
the
house
7911
and
those
finally
died
on
the
floor.
they
were
reported
on
a
committee
but
they
died
on
the
floor.
then
the
next
year
in
1963,
i
do
not
include
this
in
my
brief
unfortunately.
i
didn't
have
all
the
legislative
history
research
facilities
in
portland
and
i
check
this
out
with
the
congressional
library
here.
but
in
the
88th
congress,
again
two
bills
were
introduced,
s.555
and
h.r.
1070
but
those
bills
again
were
to
provide
for
proportional
fault
and
to
really
enact
the
substance
of
brussels
and
they
never
got
out
of
committee,
never
got
out
of
subcommittee.
now,
so
much
for
the
past
history,
this
court
although
was
a
personal
injury
case
that
reiterated
in
halcyon,
the
rule
that
the
collision
cases
that's
50/50
and
as
recently
as
1963
in
weyerhaeuser
versus
united
states,
a
unanimous
decision
opinion
written
by
mr.
justice
potter
again,
referred
to
the
rule
that
we
have
here
a
rule
which
is
work
with
the
--
i
don't
want
to
miss
quote
it.
it's
in
my
brief
but
anyway,
recondition
was
paid
to
the
rule
in
1963
that
in
collision
case,
it's
always
50/50.
now,
briefly
on
the
merits
of
this
rule
versus
proportional
fault,
it
--
contrary
to
what
my
colleague
says,
i'm
sure
that
it
promotes
settlements.
i
think
from
my
experience
--
mr.
erskine
b.
wood
it
certainly
eliminates
one
issue.
i
think
experienced
lawyers
sitting
across
the
table
will
recognize
--
well,
there
were
some
fault
here
and
there
are
some
fault
there
and
we
settle
50/50.
in
my
own
experience
of
30
years,
i
have
never
tried
a
major
--
you
know
a
big
half
million,
million
or
two
million
dollar
collision
case.
i
settled
many
of
them
and
i
don't
know
one
in
which
i
didn't
say,
“your
ship
was
a
lot
more
at
fault
than
ours,”
and
the
other
fellow
was
saying,
“your
ship
was
a
lot
more
at
fault.”
but
when
you
get
all
through
arguing,
you
have
to
admit
that
there
was
some
fault
on
both
sides
and
you
settle
at
50/50.
now,
the
andrea
doria,
stockholm
which
was
probably
one
of
the
major
collisions
with
most
money
involved
never
--
i
don't
believe
it
was
ever
tried
in
the
district
court.
it
was
an
ultimate
settlement.
these
cases
have
uniformly
been
settled
and
it's
a
pretty
practical
rule
because
as
my
colleague's
brief
points
out,
you've
got
mostly
whole
insurance
companies
on
both
sides
of
these
things
and
maybe
they
lose
a
little
here
but
they
evens
up
with
the
next
case.
maybe
in
one
case,
they
thought
they
should
have
come
two
thirds,
one-third
but
next
case
is
the
other
way
and
they're
all
settled
50/50.
now,
for
just
for
a
moment
on
the
burden
that
this
might
place
on
the
courts,
not
only
do
i
think
that
if
you
have
a
proportional
fault
rule,
each
side
is
going
to
say,
“your
ship
is
more
at
fault.”
“no,
yours
is
more
at
fault,”
that
you're
going
to
litigate
but
you're
going
make
the
trials
much
longer
because
it's
going
to
get
to
be
a
game
of
points.
now,
if
i
can
just
prove
that
you
violated
the
rule
of
sight,
you
were
going
too
fast
in
fog,
that's
all
i
have
to
prove.
but
if
we
get
to
proportional
fault,
i
want
to
prove
that
he
was
not
keeping
a
proper
look
out
on
the
bow,
that
he
wasn't
lowering
his
danger
signals,
he
wasn't
lowering
his
fog
signals.
they
turn
port
when
it
should
have
gone
starboard.
his
radar
watch
was
inadequate
and
i
am
going
to
try
to
build
that
about
10
points
so
that
if
he
proves
a
couple
of
good
points
against
me,
i've
still
got
an
8020.
i
think
you're
going
to
have
your
trials
to
get
to
be
sort
of
a
game
of
points
and
trials
are
going
to
be
a
lot
long.
now,
brussels
convention,
very
frankly,
i
handily
with
the
court,
i
favor
brussels
convention
in
toto
but
i
don't
think
--
i
think
it
would
be
a
great
mistake
to
try
to
change
--
to
adapt
what
rule
of
proportional
fault
which
is
kind
of
a
piece
meal
adaption
of
brussels
convention.
remember
that
brussels
convention
also
regulates
the
obligations
toward
cargo,
and
this
is
very
important
to
this
case
to
understand
the
ship
owner's
obligations
toward
cargo
because
every
major
collision
case
or
almost
everyone,
you
have
inextricably
involved
with
the
cross
liabilities
between
two
ship
owners.
you
have
their
obligations
toward
cargo.
now,
historically
--
mr.
erskine
b.
wood
we
can
do
it
tomorrow.
mr.
erskine
b.
wood
of
course.
mr.
erskine
b.
wood
let's
talk
about
it
from
time-to-time.
there
is
nothing
to
prevent
it.
i
--
i
am
sure
that
if
there
was
enough
interest
and
enough
push
in
this
thing
that
if
people
really
wanted
the
50/50
rule
of
change
--
mr.
erskine
b.
wood
insurance
companies,
steamship
owners,
cargo
owners,
people
if
they
wanted
to
get
a
law
pass,
there
wouldn't
be
any
great
problem
about
it.
mr.
erskine
b.
wood
sure,
i'd
love
it.
mr.
erskine
b.
wood
you
say
it's
been
before
congress,
yes
--
mr.
erskine
b.
wood
--
since
1937.
mr.
erskine
b.
wood
i
believe
not,
mr.
chief
justice.
the
first
that
i
have
found
that
it
was
presented
was
1937
which
all
it
was
originally
adapted
1910
but
i
think
it
--
we
have
to
allow
25
years
in
order
to
be
adapted
by
a
lot
of
the
other
maritime
nations
and
then
when
they
got
to
be
pretty
uniformly
adapted
by
the
other
maritime
nations,
they
made
to
push
to
have
it
done
here.
they
never
took
hold
of
them.
now,
i
want
to
explain
this
matter
of
cargo.
you
see
the
cargo
on
the
carrier.
it's
important
to
distinguish
between
the
carrying
vessel
which
carries
the
cargo
and
a
non-carrying
vessel.
for
many
years
under
acts
of
congress,
the
harter
act,
carriage
of
goods
by
sea
act,
we
call
it
cogsa.
cargo
has
not
right
to
recover
against
its
own
ship,
the
carrying
ship,
for
negligent
navigation
which
is
involved
in
collisions
but
cargo
has
always
had
the
right
to
recover
a
100%
against
the
non-carrying
vessel.
now
--
so
that's
what
happens.
cargo
gets
100%
of
its
recovery
against
the
non-carrying
vessel
and
under
the
50/50
rule
a
non-carrying
vessel
then
includes
its
payment
to
cargo
in
its
damages
and
gets
them
back
from
the
--
and
gets
50%
back
from
the
carrying
vessels.
so
indirectly,
the
carrying
vessel
ends
up
paying
50%
of
the
damage
to
its
own
cargo
but
no
more.
they
used
to
try
to
devise
bill
of
lading
clauses
to
get
around
that
but
in
the
united
states
against
the
atlantic
mutual,
this
court
held
those
bill
of
lading
clauses
void
as
against
public
policy.
so
the
law
is
well
settled
that
the
innocent
cargo
recovers
a
100%
against
the
non-carrying
vessel
which
in
turn
gets
50%
back
from
the
carrying
vessel.
but
now,
if
you
were
to
adapt
piecemeal,
an
extract
out
of
brussels
convention,
a
rule
of
proportional
fault,
look
at
the
result.
he
would
create
innocent
cargo
on
the
carrying
vessel.
and
let's
assume
the
carrying
vessel
is
90%
to
blame
and
non-carrying
vessel
is
10%.
the
innocent
cargo
gets
a
100%
of
its
damages
against
that
10%
to
blame
non-carrying
ship.
that
ship
in
turn,
under
proportional
fault,
we
get
90%
of
the
damages
back
from
the
carrying
vessel.
so
you
have
the
carrying
vessel
which
congress
under
harter
act
in
cogsa
says
it's
not
responsible
for
damage
to
the
cargo
due
to
negligent
navigation
as
being
indirectly
held
for
90%
of
the
damage.
now
this
does
two
things.
number
one,
it
pushes
us
a
lot
further
away
from
the
law
of
other
nations.
if
is
--
if
we're
trying
to
achieve
uniformity,
let's
try
to
get
some
uniformity
on
maritime
law
with
england
and
japan
and
italy
and
germany.
but
here,
we'd
be
pushing
to
think
further
from
uniformity
because
here
you
create
situations
where
cargo
would
end
up
with
a
90%
recovery
from
its
own
vessel
and
under
the
law
of
all
other
maritime
nations,
cargo
cannot
recover
from
its
own
vessel
and
its
recovery
against
the
non-carrying
ship
is
not
a
100%
but
it
is
such
percentage
is
that
non-carrying
vessel
is
at
fault.
not
only
the
--
create
habit
with
uniformity
but
you
open
the
door
at
least
you
create
an
atmosphere
where
--
which
is
an
invitation
to
collision.
a
ship
carrying
a
valuable
cargo,
we
say
a
million
dollars
of
cargo
damage
and
maybe
there's
only
100,000
scattered
damage
to
the
wholes
of
the
two
ships,
like
she
is
going
to
come,
if
she
is
pretty
much
to
blame,
she
is
going
to
come
in
and
try
to
admit
sole
blame
and
say,
“i'm
100%
at
fault.
that
other
ship
was
free
and
clear,”
and
shape
a
witness's
testimony
that
way
because
if
she
is
a
100%
to
blame,
she
doesn't
have
to
pay
any
cargo
damage.
the
cargo
can't
recover
against
the
other
ship
--
excuse
me.
yeah,
if
she
is
a
100
--
if
a
carrying
vessel
is
a
100%
to
blame
that
presupposes
that
the
non-carrying
vessel
has
no
fault
so
cargo
gets
nothing.
and
so,
with
the
million
dollar
cargo
damage
and
ships,
maybe
100,000
whole
of
damage,
why
--
the
ship
is
going
to
throw
the
case
if
it
can
do
so
gracefully
and
escape
that
million
dollar
liability
even
though
it
might
pick
up
the
$100,000
tab.
i
think
it
opens
the
door
to
collision
that
leads
to
ridiculous
results
as
far
as
the
forum
shopping.
i'd
never
seen
any
great
--
amount
of
forum
shopping
on
this.
i
don't
think
it
exists
and
when
the
collisions
are
on
--
in
the
waters,
of
course
they're
controlled
by
the
law
of
the
place
and
forum
shopping
doesn't
do
you
any
good.
i
submit
that
the
rule
shouldn't
conclude
by
saying
that
the
rule
is
a
workable
rule.
we've
had
it
for
100
years.
we
don't
have
the
reason
for
change
here
that
you
had
in
(inaudible)
in
(inaudible),
that
involving
death
on
inland
waters,
we
had
utter
chaos
in
the
maritime
field
and
substantive
right
of
recovery
for
death
because
you
relegated
the
suitor
to
the
state
death
statute
which
varied
from
state
to
state,
in
some
places
there
was
a
bar
in
other
places
which
proportionately
--
in
all
kinds
of
nonuniform
results.
we
don't
have
the
reason
for
trying
to
make
new
law
or
changing
the
law
that
you
had
in
(inaudible)
and
in
view
of
the
legislative
history,
i
think
this
thing
should
be
straightened
up
by
congress
and
i
agree
with
--
i
believe
it
was
mr.
justice
rehnquist's
absence
of
briefs
amicus
here
and
the
absence
of
any
recent
efforts
in
congress
shows
that
everybody
is
pretty
well
satisfied
with
this
50/50
rule.
it's
a
good
work
for
a
rule.
