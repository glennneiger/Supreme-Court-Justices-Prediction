mr.
kenneth
e.
roberts
mr.
chief
justice,
if
it
pleases
this
honorable
court.
this
marine
ship
collision
case
occurred
on
christmas
eve
in
1967,
24th
of
december
1967
at
about
8:30
p.m.
on
the
columbia
river,
which
flows
as
you
know
between
the
states
of
oregon
and
washington.
my
client,
union
oil
company
was
the
bareboat
charter
of
the
tanker
santa
maria.
santa
maria
was
approximately
550
feet
long
and
she
had
a
gross
ton
each
of
about
11,000.
she
was
loaded
with
17,000
gallons
of
petroleum
products
and
was
inbound
from
the
pacific
coast
ocean
to
portland,
oregon.
she's
an
american
flag
vessel.
at
astoria,
oregon,
she
took
aboard
a
columbia
river
pilot,
mr.
mcdonald
caples
who
has
been
going
to
see
on
the
columbia
river,
a
tugboat
man
and
so
forth
since
1928.
this
was
his
3550th
ship
as
a
pilot
on
the
columbia
river.
he
had
also
piloted
the
santa
maria
he
testified
about
11
to
12
times.
he
proceeded
inbound
from
astoria
to
portland.
this
is
a
winding
course
that
takes
a
number
of
hours.
some
fog
was
experienced
near
the
town
or
the
inlet
of
skamokawa,
which
is
on
the
washington
side
of
the
columbia
river
pretty
close
to
its
mouth.
the
chief
mate
of
the
vessel
was
mr.
aspland
and
he
testified
that
you
always
find
a
little
fog
at
skamokawa
at
that
time
of
the
year.
the
vessel
proceeded
on
mainly
on
a
full
bell
but
from
maneuvering
speed
in
the
river,
which
is
about
11
to
12
knots
and
there
was
a
vessel
that
was
inbound
called
the
teak
wood
under
the
command
of
captain
(inaudible)
who
was
also
a
columbia
river
pilot.
the
pilots
at
that
time
were
communicating
with
one
another
by
a
walkie-talkie
machine.
and
they
just
converse
about
the
traffic
on
the
river
and
the
conditions
and
so
forth.
and
captain
caples
through
this
walkie-talkie
communication
was
aware
that
there
was
a
tug
and
barge
bound
downstream
on
the
columbia
river
from
rainier,
oregon.
now
this
time,
it
was
the
san
jacinto.
mr.
kenneth
e.
roberts
pardon?
mr.
kenneth
e.
roberts
just
about
a
knot
i
think,
according
to
the
--
and
downstream
as
i
recollect
from
the
evidence,
with
very
little
current.
i
don't
think
it
had
really
any
significance
as
far
as
the
collision
was
concerned.
the
san
jacinto
was
owned
and
operated
by
star
&
crescent,
had
a
completely
inexperienced
crew
aboard.
the
--
not
that
the
man
had
any
papers
or
such.
the
master
i
think,
it
was
either
his
first
or
second
trip.
and
towing
and
towed
by
the
san
jacinto
was
this
big
barge
called
the
oliver
j.
olson
3,
which
was
fully
loaded
with
lumber
above
the
deck
about
two
or
three
tiers
high
at
which
--
and
the
lumber
had
been
loaded
at
rainier.
now,
the
tugboat
was
towing
on
a
250-foot
cable.
the
barge
i
think
was
about
300
--
250
to
300
feet
in
length.
now,
downstream
at
the
same
time
or
about
this
time
was
captain
olson,
another
columbia
river
pilot,
who
was
piloting
a
pacific
telstar.
he
was
also
in
communication
with
captain
caples
on
the
santa
maria
by
the
walkie-talkie
and
he
advised
that
he
had
passed
the
tug
and
barge.
he
also
advised
there
was
a
little,
what
they
call
toolie
fog
on
the
columbia
river
at
this
time.
now
this
is
a
fog
that
kind
of
hangs
down
toward
the
water
and
it
was
mainly
on
the
washington
side,
it
was
patchy.
the
pilots
all
had
testified
it
hadn't
impeded
the
traffic
on
the
river
as
demonstrated
by
the
evidence
in
any
way.
and
that
it
was
to
be
expected
at
this
time
of
the
year
and
the
toolie
fog,
i
think
the
best
way
to
describe
it,
if
you've
got
a
fairly
large
vessel,
you
probably
could
see
the
top
of
the
mast,
but
you
couldn't
see
the
hull
and
it
was
all
--
all
patchy
parts
of
it
were
all
over
on
the
washington
side
of
the
river.
now,
i
think
it
is
important
to
visualize
the
scene
of
this
particular
casualty.
this
is
a
narrow
channel
and
one
of
the
exhibits
which
were
introduced
into
the
evidence
shows
the
channel
itself
and
this
is
just
a
blowup
of
the
coast
in
geodetic
survey
chart.
and
the
accident
occurred
right
here
at
buoy
number
70.
the
bridge
channel
right
at
the
scene
of
the
collision
is
500
feet
wide.
the
actual
river
at
this
point
which
is
maneuverable
at
least
as
far
as
big
vessels
are
concerned
or
vessels
with
a
large
draft.
and
by
the
way,
the
santa
maria
was
drawing
31
feet
at
the
stern.
it
is
about
800
feet
wide
although
going
from
the
oregon
to
the
washington
shore
or
ever
to
wallace
island
is
about
1500
feet
but
of
that
amount,
there
is
over
800
feet
that's
ashore
just
to
the
north
side
there
of
wallace
island.
now,
there
is
no
doubt
in
my
opinion
that
the
evidence
clearly
demonstrates
that
the
pilots
all
know
about
the
tug
and
barge.
captain
caples
had
seen
her
visually
and
he
had
seen
her
on
radar.
the
other
pilots
had
seen
the
tug
and
barge
visually
and
on
radar.
now,
at
or
about
this
cooper
point
and
water
for
the
area,
which
are
two
lights
on
the
washington
side
of
the
river,
there
was
some
of
this
toolie
fog
and
it
was
a
patch.
mr.
kenneth
e.
roberts
t-o-o-l-i-e
that's
phonetically,
that's
--
i've
never
heard
it
before
but
this
is
what
the
natives
were
saying
it
was
toolie
fog.
the
tugboat
was
navigating
by
following
the
trees
on
the
bank
of
the
washington
side
of
the
river
and
you
will
note
from
the
exhibit
in
the
chart
that
i
have
shown
that
the
river
turns
a
little
and
the
pilots
navigate
on
range
lights
and
on
courses
at
this
particular
point
in
the
entire
length
of
the
columbia
river.
mr.
kenneth
e.
roberts
nothing
at
all
in
the
record.
the
vessel
and
i
think
counsel
will
admit
--
opposing
counsel.
it's
not
unusual
for
the
columbia
river.
in
fact,
they'd
had
a
lot
of
bigger
vessels
and
a
number
of
tankers
come
in
on
a
periodic
business
all
the
time
from
the
refineries
in
the
california
area
and
washington.
so
it's
not
an
unusual
vessel
by
any
means.
in
fact,
as
i
have
indicated,
captain
caples
have
been
on
there
11
or
12
times.
mr.
kenneth
e.
roberts
pardon
your
honor.
mr.
kenneth
e.
roberts
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
although,
the
chief
mate
mr.
aspland
testified
that
as
to
maneuvering
speed
in
the
--
in
the
river,
full
speed
ahead
was
11
to
12
knots
and
half
speed
ahead
was
about
7
to
8
and
slow
ahead
was
5
to
6.
now
just
prior
--
mr.
kenneth
e.
roberts
the
master
--
the
helmsman
had
testified,
and
i
think
it's
on
page
73
of
the
record.
question
-
i
see
is,
“what
did
you
do
after
the
slow
down?”
answer
-
“the
quarter
master,
he
said
it
wasn't
steering
so
i
went
back
to
half
speed,
which
is
40
revolutions
for
steering.”
that's
in
the
record.
mr.
kenneth
e.
roberts
under
these
circumstances,
the
--
i
think
to
be
perfectly
honest
and
frank
about
it,
the
record
would
indicate
that
at
this
draft
at
31
feet
and
fully
loaded,
the
vessel
would
be
what
they
call
smelling
the
bottom
and
it's
pretty
hard
for
it
to
steer
at
a
low
rate
of
speed.
and
so
my
position
is
that
seven
to
eight
under
these
circumstances
was
more
than
justified
and
reasonable.
now,
there
is
evidence
in
the
record
to
the
effect
that
once
you're
on
slow
speed
and
are
continuing
for
any
length
of
time,
you
do
maintain
steerageway
but
i
don't
think
it
was
in
relation
to
a
vessel
in
these
inland
borders
and
secondly,
i
do
not
believe
that
that
took
into
consideration
the
fact
that
--
that
pilot
was
changing
courses
all
the
time
coming
up
the
columbia
river.
and
therefore,
when
he
was
changing
course,
it
was
necessary
that
he'd
be
on
half
ahead
rather
than
slow
ahead.
mr.
kenneth
e.
roberts
it's
a
28
feet
bridge
i
think
your
honor
at
this
particular
point,
mr.
justice
stewart.
it's
not
very,
very
a
deep
river.
the
corps
of
engineers
dredge
it
at
all
times
and
there
is
some
appropriations
to
widen
the
--
deepen
the
depths
of
the
columbia
river.
mr.
kenneth
e.
roberts
no.
i
don't
think
the
tide
comes
all
the
way
up
by
--
by
any
means.
it's
fresh
water
at
portland
and
--
and
longview
i
believe.
mr.
kenneth
e.
roberts
that
she
was
31
feet.
i
think
the
--
maybe
i
mistook
myself.
it
was
31
feet
and
i
think
the
dredged
channel
is
36
or
38
feet
at
this
point.
the
dredge
--
and
that
is
shown
by
the
dotted
line
on
the
chart.
usually
--
mr.
kenneth
e.
roberts
i
realize
that.
mr.
kenneth
e.
roberts
mr.
chief
justice
and
this
honorable
court.
mr.
kenneth
e.
roberts
i
will
get
to
the
legal
issues,
your
honor.
mr.
kenneth
e.
roberts
i
will
clear
up
the
record.
the
publications
indicate
that
dredge
depth
for
the
channel
was
from
35
to
40
feet.
the
army
engineers
like
to
maintain
it.
the
issues
before
this
court
arise
out
of
the
fact
that
the
trial
judge
found
the
tug
and
barge
solely
at
fault
for
this
collision
and
said
that
the
evidence
was
overwhelming
to
support
such
as
a
decision.
the
case
was
appealed
by
the
tug
and
barge
to
the
ninth
circuit
on
one
ground.
and
that
was
that
at
the
time
the
barge
going
--
probably,
the
santa
maria
going
at
about
seven
knots
constituted
a
violation
of
the
speed
in
fog
rule
which
is
rule
16
which
requires
a
vessel
to
go
at
a
moderate
speed
when
travelling
in
fog,
or
rain
and
so
forth.
the
ninth
circuit
under
the
ruling
in
the
silver
palm,
a
ninth
circuit
decision,
interprets
the
word
moderate
speed
in
fog
to
mean
that
a
vessel
apparently
must
stop
within
a
half
the
distance
that
you
can
see
ahead.
and
in
this
case,
the
ninth
circuit
reasoned
that
the
distance
was
probably
about
900
feet.
although,
i
don't
think
there
is
any
evidence
in
the
record
to
substantiate
that.
and
therefore,
the
tugboat
--
the
barge,
pardon
me,
the
santa
maria
should
have
stopped
within
450
feet
and
of
course
this
is
impossible
at
the
speed
of
seven
knots
that
it
was
travelling.
we
take
the
position
on
this
appeal
that
this
is
in
conflict
with
other
circuit
decisions,
the
second,
third,
fourth,
fifth
and
in
particular,
where
the
fifth
circuit's
decision
in
the
hess
voyager
where
that
rule,
article
16,
moderate
speed
was
interpreted
to
mean,
taking
into
consideration
all
of
the
circumstances
surrounding
the
location
of
the
collision
and
the
circumstances
leading
to
the
collision
itself.
in
this
case,
we
feel
that
the
evidence
justifies
an
adoption
of
the
rule
of
the
majority
of
the
circuits
that
moderate
speed
cannot
be
interpreted
to
mean
half
the
distance
ahead
but
that
the
trier
of
the
facts
must
determine
based
on
all
of
the
circumstances
then
prevailing
as
to
whether
a
vessel
was
or
was
not
going
at
moderate
speed
so
to
come
within
rule
16.
in
this
case,
we
feel
the
evidence
very
clearly
showed
that
in
determining
that
the
vessel
was
going
at
moderate
speed,
the
trial
judge
in
effect
found
that
there
was
no
probability
at
all
of
the
tug
and
barge
crossing
this
narrow
channel
and
making
a
u-turn
in
the
channel
itself
and
that
the
santa
maria
was
on
her
own
extreme
side
of
the
channel.
the
fog
was
patchy,
it
was
a
toolie
type
fog,
it
wasn't
fog
all
the
time
on
the
voyage
and
other
vessels
were
navigating
the
columbia
river
at
that
particular
time.
the
vessel
was
in
charge
of
a
very,
very
experienced
columbia
river
pilot
who
had
knowledge
of
the
river,
intimate
knowledge
of
the
river
and
other
pilots
had
indicated
at
the
time
that
the
fog
conditions
were
such
that
it
didn't
prevent
the
vessels
navigating
the
columbia
river.
mr.
kenneth
e.
roberts
no
i
don't
think
it
is.
the
rule
of
sight,
i
think,
is
the
same
as
the
half
distance
rule.
the
evidence,
your
honor,
indicates
in
this
case
that
we
saw
the
tug
and
barge
on
radar
and
the
mate
--
the
third
mate
on
the
bridge
saw
it
the
whole
time
in
his
binoculars.
mr.
kenneth
e.
roberts
i
do.
mr.
kenneth
e.
roberts
no.
they
are
applying
a
rule
of
reasonable
speed
under
all
of
the
circumstances
as
i
read.
mr.
kenneth
e.
roberts
i
don't
think
the
court
said
that
in
the
umbria.
that's
the
point.
we
take
the
position
that
the
ninth
circuit
in
the
silver
palm
misconstrued.
the
umbria
is
a
very
interesting
factual
case.
in
that
case,
you
add
the
contention
of
speed
on
the
part
of
the
one
vessel
but
the
outcome
of
that
case
was
that
the
umbria
was
held
solely
at
fault
even
though
there
was
speed
in
that
case
because
--
mr.
kenneth
e.
roberts
in
the
umbria
case,
i
don't
think
it
was
the
rule
of
sight.
at
least
i
don't
read
it
that
way,
your
honor.
we
are
of
the
opinion
that
the
silver
palm,
in
--
in
effect
straightjackets
the
master
or
the
pilot,
the
man
conning
the
vessel.
he
has
to
take
out
a
slide
rule,
in
effect.
now
under
these
circumstances,
the
vessel
of
the
tug
and
barge
disappear
into
the
fog.
it's
just
a
small
patch
of
fog
and
suddenly
that
barge
and
the
tug
make
a
u-turn
directly
in
front
of
the
tanker
in
this
--
this
narrow
channel.
the
only
way,
in
my
opinion,
the
fact
show
that
this
particular
incident
could
have
been
avoided
was
for
the
vessel
to
a
bunker
that
any
sign
of
fog
or
whatsoever.
and
i
really
believe
that
the
decisions
of
the
other
circuits
where
they
take
into
consideration
all
of
the
circumstances
in
determining
a
--
a
reasonable
or
moderate
speed.
judge
wright
in
the
ninth
circuit
just
went
on
speed
alone
in
reversing
and
holding
mutual
fault
in
this
case
and
the
--
the
history
of
the
rule
16
and
the
--
why
it
has
been
interpreted
by
other
circuits
is
to
the
effect
that
you
cannot
just
say
such
and
such
a
speed
is
not
moderate.
you've
got
to
take
into
consideration
all
of
the
circumstances
prevailing
at
or
at
the
--
at
or
at
the
time
of
the
collision.
and
also,
in
this
case
where
the
evidences
that
the
tugboat
can
see,
the
barge
and
tug
came
out
of
the
fog
and
the
santa
maria
could
actually
see
ahead
a
mile
and
a
half
to
two
miles,
where
do
the
distances
run
from?
did
they
run
from
the
edge
of
the
fog
bank
or
from
immediately
ahead
of
the
vessel?
judge
wright
says
from
the
edge
of
the
fog
bank.
i
feel
and
under
these
circumstances
the
master
is
put
into
a
straightjacket.
the
pilot
under
these
circumstances
he'd
have
no
alternative.
he
has
no
judgment
to
exercise
or
discretion
to
exercise.
as
soon
as
he
sees
anything
like
fog
or
reduced
visibility,
he
must
anchor
the
vessel.
and
i
don't
think
that
this
is
a
reasonable
inference
to
be
taken
from
that
particular
language
in
rule
16.
it
is,
obviously,
if
this
case
had
gone
up
in
the
fifth
circuit,
it
would
have
been
affirmed
in
my
opinion
based
on
the
hess
voyager
case
and
their
interpretation
of
rule
16.
mr.
kenneth
e.
roberts
that's
exactly
what
i'm
saying
mr.
chief
justice.
it's
--
it's
--
the
analogy
on
the
other
--
it
sounds
may
be
not
a
too
good
analogy.
you're
driving
down
a
highway,
at
a
reasonable
rate
of
speed
and
somebody
turns
in
front
of
you.
the
courts
in
the
maritime
case
says
that
we
have
the
right
to
rely
that
this
vessel,
the
tug
and
barge
will
obey
the
law
and
not
make
this
abrupt
u-turn.
mr.
kenneth
e.
roberts
when
--
that's
a
--
and
then
there
is
under
automobile
law
a
prima
facie
case
of
negligence
per
se
but
under
these
circumstances,
i
think
where
you
take
into
consideration,
the
steerage
rate
of
the
vessel,
the
testimony
of
the
helmsman
and
also
the
quartermaster
and
the
pilot,
i
think
and
the
visibility
that
was
prevailing
other
vessels
traversing
this
columbia
river
that
under
all
of
these
circumstances,
six
to
seven
knots
is
not
sufficient
to
show
fault
on
the
part
of
the
--
the
santa
maria.
i
just
think
that
the
mathematical
rule
of
half
the
distance
ahead
is
just
unworkable.
in
fact,
in
any
sort
of
a
speed
situation
case,
you're
going
to
have
fault
on
the
part
of
the
other
vessel
because
he
can't
come
along
under
the
pennsylvania
rule
and
show
that
the
speed
could
not
possibly
have
had
anything
to
do
with
it.
it
just
--
it
seems
to
be
inequitable
and
the
justice
of
this
situation,
in
my
opinion,
cries
out
for
some
remedy
to
avoid
the
consequences
of
this
ninth
circuit,
silver
palm
half-ahead
distance
rule.
now,
if
the
court
gets
to
the
question
that
we've
raised
secondly
in
this
case
as
to
the
division
of
damages.
again,
judge
wright
in
reversing
this
said,
“this
is
mutual
fault
and
therefore,
both
vessels
share
the
damage
on
a
50-50
basis.”
this
--
mr.
kenneth
e.
roberts
no,
there
was
no
reason
to
raise
it
mr.
justice
potter.
we
won
the
case
in
the
trial
court
and
we
never
anticipated
this.
so
we
raised
it
for
the
first
time
--
mr.
kenneth
e.
roberts
no,
they
would
not
have
listened
to
the
argument
i
--
in
my
opinion.
we
feel
that
this
50-50
mutual
fault
is
an
anachronism
on
the
present
authorities.
we're
the
only
maritime
nation
in
the
world
that
i
know
of
that
actually
adheres
to
it.
i
--
i
feel
that
is
a
very,
very
unfair
rule
as
demonstrated
by
the
facts
in
this
case.
even
judge
wright
in
his
opinion
finding
a
mutual
fault
said
that
the
fault
of
the
tug
and
barge
was
flagrant
and
it
was
shocking
to
--
to
some
extent.
i'd
say
that
this
case
very
aptly
demonstrates
the
inequities
of
the
mutual
fault
doctrine.
there
seems
to
be
no
doubt
that
most
of
the
shipping
industry,
the
lawyers,
the
maritime
law
association,
congress
to
some
extent,
or
at
least,
some
of
the
committees
of
congress
feel
that
the
rule
should
be
changed
and
that
the
vessel
should
be
charged
proportionately
--
proportionately
with
its
degree
of
fault.
mr.
kenneth
e.
roberts
no,
i
don't
think
so.
the
mutual
fault
doctrine
as
i
understand
it
and
read
the
cases
came
out
of
the
catherine
v.
dickinson
case.
it's
a
judge-made
law
and
if
it's
a
judge-made
law
then
the
judges
and
members
of
this
court
can
very
easily
change
it
as
very
definitely
demonstrated
in
the
hawn
versus
pope
&
talbot
where
this
court
said
the
contributory
negligence
was
not
at
bar
in
a
maritime
tort
situation
where
this
court
in
the
(inaudible)
case
said
that
there
is
a
cause
of
action
in
inland
waters
for
wrongful
death
based
on
unseaworthiness.
there
is
no
statutory
prohibition
in
any
way
preventing
this
court
from
changing
that
archaic
rule
of
mutual
fault
under
the
circumstances
or
any
of
the
circumstances
of
any
maritime
collision
as
we
have
--
demonstrated
by
the
terms
of
our
brief.
mr.
kenneth
e.
roberts
i'm
familiar
with
that
particular
case.
that
was
a
maritime
personal
injury
case
arising
out
of
a
maritime
personal
injury
case
and
it
was
indemnity
by
one
side
against
the
other
after
the
original
judgements
have
been
played
off.
in
that
particular
case
though,
as
to
the
merits
of
the
case
in
chief
that
supported
the
action
for
indemnity
comparative
rule
of
principles
where
in
fact
applied.
the
longshoreman
or
the
railroad
worker
working
on
the
barge
in
that
case,
if
he
was
contributory
or
negligent
--
or
if
he
was
negligent,
his
damages
were
reduced
to
the
degree
of
his
negligence,
so
comparative
negligence,
and
in
this
case,
we've
got
original
parties.
this
is
not
a
case
for
indemnity
and
that's
the
only
way
i
can
distinguish
this
particular
case
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
the
--
the
atlantic
railroad
case
certainly
and
all
maritime
cases
that
i
know
of,
the
jones
act,
the
longshore
and
harbor
workers
act
cases
and
so
forth,
comparative
negligence
has
been
applied
by
this
court
and
by
other
court
state
and
federal
in
determining
degree
of
fault
in
the
personal
injury
field.
the
only
difference
that
we
are
asking
you
to
do
at
this
time
is
to
make
it
uniform
and
apply
it
in
a
property
damage
case.
that's
all
we've
got
here
--
mr.
kenneth
e.
roberts
that's
exactly
--
mr.
kenneth
e.
roberts
and
--
and
i
think
that
type
of
a
situation
leads
to
litigation
because
you
get
a
situation
and
i
think
lawyers,
when
they
get
amongst
themselves
and
litigation
and
attend
to
be
fair
with
one
another
and
can
be
determined
based
on
the
facts,
the
relative
degrees
of
fault
of
their
two
vessels.
however,
where
--
you
get
a
situation
where
you
got
one,
obviously
90%
at
fault
and
another
--
a
vessel
may
be
only
10%
at
fault
and
may
be
it
was
a
statutory
fault
and
there's
nothing
to
do
with
contributory
--
approximate
course
elements
in
the
case
in
any
way
then
the
other
lawyers
are
going
to
ask
for
mutual
fault
--
mutual
fault
all
the
time
whereas,
if
we
had
a
comparative
fault
doctrine
and
a
gain
on
that
hypothetical,
maybe
they'd
settle
the
case
on
the
basis
of
8515
or
even
8020.
no
one
is
outraged
by
that
type
of
negotiation
and
settlement
and
i
think
it's
very,
very
proper
that
that
type
of
the
settlement
can
go
on
but
i
think,
it
cannot
go
on
in
this
particular
field
where
you
have
this
archaic,
what
i
consider
to
be
archaic,
outmoded
doctrine
of
mutual
fault.
and
i
don't
see
any
reason
at
all
from
a
legislative,
political,
or
social
purpose
why
the
united
states
should
be
the
only
maritime
nation
that
adopts
this
particular
mutual
fault.
mr.
kenneth
e.
roberts
pardon?
mr.
kenneth
e.
roberts
they
were
fairly
equal
in
this
case.
the
barge
was
the
only
one
that
sustained
collision
damage
because
the
tugboat
had
made
the
u-turn
and
the
tank
has
sustained
damage
on
its
port
bow
and
the
starboard
side
of
the
barge
sustained
damages.
there
was
a
little
more,
i
believe,
damage
on
the
barge
itself
that
which
would
mean
that
the
vessel,
my
client,
the
santa
maria
under
the
mutual
fault
doctrine
will
be
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
kenneth
e.
roberts
--
to
the
other
side.
mr.
kenneth
e.
roberts
and
that's
what
--
so
i
think
unfortunate
about
such
a
doctrine.
there
is
also
some
indication
that
it
leads
to
foreign
shopping.
that's
where
you
get
--
in
inland
waters
or
a
vessel
in
collision
with
another
they
will
try
and
get
it
to
the
united
states
court
for
the
simple
reason
that
the
court
would
basically
apply
the
law
of
the
forum
or
the
united
states
which
is
the
mutual
fault
of
doctrine
and
everything
went
down
like
middle
50-50.
also,
from
a
human
nature
viewpoint,
i
think
this
type
of
a
doctrine
tends
to
make
the
trial
judge
take
the
easy
way
out
in
all
sincerity
instead
of
really
looking
at
all
the
facts
that
judge
kilkenny
did
in
this
case
and
he
made
his
own
opinion
and
adopted
it
as
his
findings
there
is
some
inclination
to
say,
“well,
under
the
mutual
fault
doctrine,
all
i've
got
to
do
is
to
find
a
little,”
and
that's
the
end
of
the
case,
and
i
believe
that
the
doctrine
is
not
usable
anymore
and
that
this
court
should
overrule
it.
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
kenneth
e.
roberts
i
don't
think
that
does.
the
--
it's
not
all
insurance
companies,
some
of
these
vessels
as
the
court
knows
has
brought
very
large
deductibles
on
collision
liabilities
and
things
to
this
nature.
and
i
don't
think
the
absence
of
anyone
from
industry
or
from
the
maritime
law
association,
the
congressional
records
which
we
have
sighted
in
our
brief,
would
certainly
indicate
that
the
great
majority
of
the
people
concerned
in
this
field
would
likely
proportionate
fault
rule.
thank
you.
mr.
kenneth
e.
roberts
i
just
have
a
couple
of
remarks,
sir.
under
the
comparative
fault
doctrine,
mr.
wood
has
already
said
that
under
the
mutual
fault
doctrine,
the
non-carrying
vessel
puts
up
if
it's
10%
of
fault
now
it
still
gets
50%
back
from
the
carrying
vessel.
it
seems
to
me
that
if
it
gets
90%
back
from
the
carrying
vessel
based
on
comparative
fault
that
is
more
equitable
and
just
under
all
of
the
circumstances
and
i
can't
see
any
difference
or
validity
to
his
argument
between
the
50%
which
he
gets
back
now
and
the
90%
which
he'd
get
back
on
if
this
court
has
decided
to
--
to
adapt
the
comparative
fault
rule.
that's
all
i
have.
thank
you.
mr.
kenneth
e.
roberts
mr.
chief
justice,
if
it
pleases
this
honorable
court.
this
marine
ship
collision
case
occurred
on
christmas
eve
in
1967,
24th
of
december
1967
at
about
8:30
p.m.
on
the
columbia
river,
which
flows
as
you
know
between
the
states
of
oregon
and
washington.
my
client,
union
oil
company
was
the
bareboat
charter
of
the
tanker
santa
maria.
santa
maria
was
approximately
550
feet
long
and
she
had
a
gross
ton
each
of
about
11,000.
she
was
loaded
with
17,000
gallons
of
petroleum
products
and
was
inbound
from
the
pacific
coast
ocean
to
portland,
oregon.
she's
an
american
flag
vessel.
at
astoria,
oregon,
she
took
aboard
a
columbia
river
pilot,
mr.
mcdonald
caples
who
has
been
going
to
see
on
the
columbia
river,
a
tugboat
man
and
so
forth
since
1928.
this
was
his
3550th
ship
as
a
pilot
on
the
columbia
river.
he
had
also
piloted
the
santa
maria
he
testified
about
11
to
12
times.
he
proceeded
inbound
from
astoria
to
portland.
this
is
a
winding
course
that
takes
a
number
of
hours.
some
fog
was
experienced
near
the
town
or
the
inlet
of
skamokawa,
which
is
on
the
washington
side
of
the
columbia
river
pretty
close
to
its
mouth.
the
chief
mate
of
the
vessel
was
mr.
aspland
and
he
testified
that
you
always
find
a
little
fog
at
skamokawa
at
that
time
of
the
year.
the
vessel
proceeded
on
mainly
on
a
full
bell
but
from
maneuvering
speed
in
the
river,
which
is
about
11
to
12
knots
and
there
was
a
vessel
that
was
inbound
called
the
teak
wood
under
the
command
of
captain
(inaudible)
who
was
also
a
columbia
river
pilot.
the
pilots
at
that
time
were
communicating
with
one
another
by
a
walkie-talkie
machine.
and
they
just
converse
about
the
traffic
on
the
river
and
the
conditions
and
so
forth.
and
captain
caples
through
this
walkie-talkie
communication
was
aware
that
there
was
a
tug
and
barge
bound
downstream
on
the
columbia
river
from
rainier,
oregon.
now
this
time,
it
was
the
san
jacinto.
mr.
kenneth
e.
roberts
pardon?
mr.
kenneth
e.
roberts
just
about
a
knot
i
think,
according
to
the
--
and
downstream
as
i
recollect
from
the
evidence,
with
very
little
current.
i
don't
think
it
had
really
any
significance
as
far
as
the
collision
was
concerned.
the
san
jacinto
was
owned
and
operated
by
star
&
crescent,
had
a
completely
inexperienced
crew
aboard.
the
--
not
that
the
man
had
any
papers
or
such.
the
master
i
think,
it
was
either
his
first
or
second
trip.
and
towing
and
towed
by
the
san
jacinto
was
this
big
barge
called
the
oliver
j.
olson
3,
which
was
fully
loaded
with
lumber
above
the
deck
about
two
or
three
tiers
high
at
which
--
and
the
lumber
had
been
loaded
at
rainier.
now,
the
tugboat
was
towing
on
a
250-foot
cable.
the
barge
i
think
was
about
300
--
250
to
300
feet
in
length.
now,
downstream
at
the
same
time
or
about
this
time
was
captain
olson,
another
columbia
river
pilot,
who
was
piloting
a
pacific
telstar.
he
was
also
in
communication
with
captain
caples
on
the
santa
maria
by
the
walkie-talkie
and
he
advised
that
he
had
passed
the
tug
and
barge.
he
also
advised
there
was
a
little,
what
they
call
toolie
fog
on
the
columbia
river
at
this
time.
now
this
is
a
fog
that
kind
of
hangs
down
toward
the
water
and
it
was
mainly
on
the
washington
side,
it
was
patchy.
the
pilots
all
had
testified
it
hadn't
impeded
the
traffic
on
the
river
as
demonstrated
by
the
evidence
in
any
way.
and
that
it
was
to
be
expected
at
this
time
of
the
year
and
the
toolie
fog,
i
think
the
best
way
to
describe
it,
if
you've
got
a
fairly
large
vessel,
you
probably
could
see
the
top
of
the
mast,
but
you
couldn't
see
the
hull
and
it
was
all
--
all
patchy
parts
of
it
were
all
over
on
the
washington
side
of
the
river.
now,
i
think
it
is
important
to
visualize
the
scene
of
this
particular
casualty.
this
is
a
narrow
channel
and
one
of
the
exhibits
which
were
introduced
into
the
evidence
shows
the
channel
itself
and
this
is
just
a
blowup
of
the
coast
in
geodetic
survey
chart.
and
the
accident
occurred
right
here
at
buoy
number
70.
the
bridge
channel
right
at
the
scene
of
the
collision
is
500
feet
wide.
the
actual
river
at
this
point
which
is
maneuverable
at
least
as
far
as
big
vessels
are
concerned
or
vessels
with
a
large
draft.
and
by
the
way,
the
santa
maria
was
drawing
31
feet
at
the
stern.
it
is
about
800
feet
wide
although
going
from
the
oregon
to
the
washington
shore
or
ever
to
wallace
island
is
about
1500
feet
but
of
that
amount,
there
is
over
800
feet
that's
ashore
just
to
the
north
side
there
of
wallace
island.
now,
there
is
no
doubt
in
my
opinion
that
the
evidence
clearly
demonstrates
that
the
pilots
all
know
about
the
tug
and
barge.
captain
caples
had
seen
her
visually
and
he
had
seen
her
on
radar.
the
other
pilots
had
seen
the
tug
and
barge
visually
and
on
radar.
now,
at
or
about
this
cooper
point
and
water
for
the
area,
which
are
two
lights
on
the
washington
side
of
the
river,
there
was
some
of
this
toolie
fog
and
it
was
a
patch.
mr.
kenneth
e.
roberts
t-o-o-l-i-e
that's
phonetically,
that's
--
i've
never
heard
it
before
but
this
is
what
the
natives
were
saying
it
was
toolie
fog.
the
tugboat
was
navigating
by
following
the
trees
on
the
bank
of
the
washington
side
of
the
river
and
you
will
note
from
the
exhibit
in
the
chart
that
i
have
shown
that
the
river
turns
a
little
and
the
pilots
navigate
on
range
lights
and
on
courses
at
this
particular
point
in
the
entire
length
of
the
columbia
river.
mr.
kenneth
e.
roberts
nothing
at
all
in
the
record.
the
vessel
and
i
think
counsel
will
admit
--
opposing
counsel.
it's
not
unusual
for
the
columbia
river.
in
fact,
they'd
had
a
lot
of
bigger
vessels
and
a
number
of
tankers
come
in
on
a
periodic
business
all
the
time
from
the
refineries
in
the
california
area
and
washington.
so
it's
not
an
unusual
vessel
by
any
means.
in
fact,
as
i
have
indicated,
captain
caples
have
been
on
there
11
or
12
times.
mr.
kenneth
e.
roberts
pardon
your
honor.
mr.
kenneth
e.
roberts
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
although,
the
chief
mate
mr.
aspland
testified
that
as
to
maneuvering
speed
in
the
--
in
the
river,
full
speed
ahead
was
11
to
12
knots
and
half
speed
ahead
was
about
7
to
8
and
slow
ahead
was
5
to
6.
now
just
prior
--
mr.
kenneth
e.
roberts
the
master
--
the
helmsman
had
testified,
and
i
think
it's
on
page
73
of
the
record.
question
-
i
see
is,
“what
did
you
do
after
the
slow
down?”
answer
-
“the
quarter
master,
he
said
it
wasn't
steering
so
i
went
back
to
half
speed,
which
is
40
revolutions
for
steering.”
that's
in
the
record.
mr.
kenneth
e.
roberts
under
these
circumstances,
the
--
i
think
to
be
perfectly
honest
and
frank
about
it,
the
record
would
indicate
that
at
this
draft
at
31
feet
and
fully
loaded,
the
vessel
would
be
what
they
call
smelling
the
bottom
and
it's
pretty
hard
for
it
to
steer
at
a
low
rate
of
speed.
and
so
my
position
is
that
seven
to
eight
under
these
circumstances
was
more
than
justified
and
reasonable.
now,
there
is
evidence
in
the
record
to
the
effect
that
once
you're
on
slow
speed
and
are
continuing
for
any
length
of
time,
you
do
maintain
steerageway
but
i
don't
think
it
was
in
relation
to
a
vessel
in
these
inland
borders
and
secondly,
i
do
not
believe
that
that
took
into
consideration
the
fact
that
--
that
pilot
was
changing
courses
all
the
time
coming
up
the
columbia
river.
and
therefore,
when
he
was
changing
course,
it
was
necessary
that
he'd
be
on
half
ahead
rather
than
slow
ahead.
mr.
kenneth
e.
roberts
it's
a
28
feet
bridge
i
think
your
honor
at
this
particular
point,
mr.
justice
stewart.
it's
not
very,
very
a
deep
river.
the
corps
of
engineers
dredge
it
at
all
times
and
there
is
some
appropriations
to
widen
the
--
deepen
the
depths
of
the
columbia
river.
mr.
kenneth
e.
roberts
no.
i
don't
think
the
tide
comes
all
the
way
up
by
--
by
any
means.
it's
fresh
water
at
portland
and
--
and
longview
i
believe.
mr.
kenneth
e.
roberts
that
she
was
31
feet.
i
think
the
--
maybe
i
mistook
myself.
it
was
31
feet
and
i
think
the
dredged
channel
is
36
or
38
feet
at
this
point.
the
dredge
--
and
that
is
shown
by
the
dotted
line
on
the
chart.
usually
--
mr.
kenneth
e.
roberts
i
realize
that.
mr.
kenneth
e.
roberts
mr.
chief
justice
and
this
honorable
court.
mr.
kenneth
e.
roberts
i
will
get
to
the
legal
issues,
your
honor.
mr.
kenneth
e.
roberts
i
will
clear
up
the
record.
the
publications
indicate
that
dredge
depth
for
the
channel
was
from
35
to
40
feet.
the
army
engineers
like
to
maintain
it.
the
issues
before
this
court
arise
out
of
the
fact
that
the
trial
judge
found
the
tug
and
barge
solely
at
fault
for
this
collision
and
said
that
the
evidence
was
overwhelming
to
support
such
as
a
decision.
the
case
was
appealed
by
the
tug
and
barge
to
the
ninth
circuit
on
one
ground.
and
that
was
that
at
the
time
the
barge
going
--
probably,
the
santa
maria
going
at
about
seven
knots
constituted
a
violation
of
the
speed
in
fog
rule
which
is
rule
16
which
requires
a
vessel
to
go
at
a
moderate
speed
when
travelling
in
fog,
or
rain
and
so
forth.
the
ninth
circuit
under
the
ruling
in
the
silver
palm,
a
ninth
circuit
decision,
interprets
the
word
moderate
speed
in
fog
to
mean
that
a
vessel
apparently
must
stop
within
a
half
the
distance
that
you
can
see
ahead.
and
in
this
case,
the
ninth
circuit
reasoned
that
the
distance
was
probably
about
900
feet.
although,
i
don't
think
there
is
any
evidence
in
the
record
to
substantiate
that.
and
therefore,
the
tugboat
--
the
barge,
pardon
me,
the
santa
maria
should
have
stopped
within
450
feet
and
of
course
this
is
impossible
at
the
speed
of
seven
knots
that
it
was
travelling.
we
take
the
position
on
this
appeal
that
this
is
in
conflict
with
other
circuit
decisions,
the
second,
third,
fourth,
fifth
and
in
particular,
where
the
fifth
circuit's
decision
in
the
hess
voyager
where
that
rule,
article
16,
moderate
speed
was
interpreted
to
mean,
taking
into
consideration
all
of
the
circumstances
surrounding
the
location
of
the
collision
and
the
circumstances
leading
to
the
collision
itself.
in
this
case,
we
feel
that
the
evidence
justifies
an
adoption
of
the
rule
of
the
majority
of
the
circuits
that
moderate
speed
cannot
be
interpreted
to
mean
half
the
distance
ahead
but
that
the
trier
of
the
facts
must
determine
based
on
all
of
the
circumstances
then
prevailing
as
to
whether
a
vessel
was
or
was
not
going
at
moderate
speed
so
to
come
within
rule
16.
in
this
case,
we
feel
the
evidence
very
clearly
showed
that
in
determining
that
the
vessel
was
going
at
moderate
speed,
the
trial
judge
in
effect
found
that
there
was
no
probability
at
all
of
the
tug
and
barge
crossing
this
narrow
channel
and
making
a
u-turn
in
the
channel
itself
and
that
the
santa
maria
was
on
her
own
extreme
side
of
the
channel.
the
fog
was
patchy,
it
was
a
toolie
type
fog,
it
wasn't
fog
all
the
time
on
the
voyage
and
other
vessels
were
navigating
the
columbia
river
at
that
particular
time.
the
vessel
was
in
charge
of
a
very,
very
experienced
columbia
river
pilot
who
had
knowledge
of
the
river,
intimate
knowledge
of
the
river
and
other
pilots
had
indicated
at
the
time
that
the
fog
conditions
were
such
that
it
didn't
prevent
the
vessels
navigating
the
columbia
river.
mr.
kenneth
e.
roberts
no
i
don't
think
it
is.
the
rule
of
sight,
i
think,
is
the
same
as
the
half
distance
rule.
the
evidence,
your
honor,
indicates
in
this
case
that
we
saw
the
tug
and
barge
on
radar
and
the
mate
--
the
third
mate
on
the
bridge
saw
it
the
whole
time
in
his
binoculars.
mr.
kenneth
e.
roberts
i
do.
mr.
kenneth
e.
roberts
no.
they
are
applying
a
rule
of
reasonable
speed
under
all
of
the
circumstances
as
i
read.
mr.
kenneth
e.
roberts
i
don't
think
the
court
said
that
in
the
umbria.
that's
the
point.
we
take
the
position
that
the
ninth
circuit
in
the
silver
palm
misconstrued.
the
umbria
is
a
very
interesting
factual
case.
in
that
case,
you
add
the
contention
of
speed
on
the
part
of
the
one
vessel
but
the
outcome
of
that
case
was
that
the
umbria
was
held
solely
at
fault
even
though
there
was
speed
in
that
case
because
--
mr.
kenneth
e.
roberts
in
the
umbria
case,
i
don't
think
it
was
the
rule
of
sight.
at
least
i
don't
read
it
that
way,
your
honor.
we
are
of
the
opinion
that
the
silver
palm,
in
--
in
effect
straightjackets
the
master
or
the
pilot,
the
man
conning
the
vessel.
he
has
to
take
out
a
slide
rule,
in
effect.
now
under
these
circumstances,
the
vessel
of
the
tug
and
barge
disappear
into
the
fog.
it's
just
a
small
patch
of
fog
and
suddenly
that
barge
and
the
tug
make
a
u-turn
directly
in
front
of
the
tanker
in
this
--
this
narrow
channel.
the
only
way,
in
my
opinion,
the
fact
show
that
this
particular
incident
could
have
been
avoided
was
for
the
vessel
to
a
bunker
that
any
sign
of
fog
or
whatsoever.
and
i
really
believe
that
the
decisions
of
the
other
circuits
where
they
take
into
consideration
all
of
the
circumstances
in
determining
a
--
a
reasonable
or
moderate
speed.
judge
wright
in
the
ninth
circuit
just
went
on
speed
alone
in
reversing
and
holding
mutual
fault
in
this
case
and
the
--
the
history
of
the
rule
16
and
the
--
why
it
has
been
interpreted
by
other
circuits
is
to
the
effect
that
you
cannot
just
say
such
and
such
a
speed
is
not
moderate.
you've
got
to
take
into
consideration
all
of
the
circumstances
prevailing
at
or
at
the
--
at
or
at
the
time
of
the
collision.
and
also,
in
this
case
where
the
evidences
that
the
tugboat
can
see,
the
barge
and
tug
came
out
of
the
fog
and
the
santa
maria
could
actually
see
ahead
a
mile
and
a
half
to
two
miles,
where
do
the
distances
run
from?
did
they
run
from
the
edge
of
the
fog
bank
or
from
immediately
ahead
of
the
vessel?
judge
wright
says
from
the
edge
of
the
fog
bank.
i
feel
and
under
these
circumstances
the
master
is
put
into
a
straightjacket.
the
pilot
under
these
circumstances
he'd
have
no
alternative.
he
has
no
judgment
to
exercise
or
discretion
to
exercise.
as
soon
as
he
sees
anything
like
fog
or
reduced
visibility,
he
must
anchor
the
vessel.
and
i
don't
think
that
this
is
a
reasonable
inference
to
be
taken
from
that
particular
language
in
rule
16.
it
is,
obviously,
if
this
case
had
gone
up
in
the
fifth
circuit,
it
would
have
been
affirmed
in
my
opinion
based
on
the
hess
voyager
case
and
their
interpretation
of
rule
16.
mr.
kenneth
e.
roberts
that's
exactly
what
i'm
saying
mr.
chief
justice.
it's
--
it's
--
the
analogy
on
the
other
--
it
sounds
may
be
not
a
too
good
analogy.
you're
driving
down
a
highway,
at
a
reasonable
rate
of
speed
and
somebody
turns
in
front
of
you.
the
courts
in
the
maritime
case
says
that
we
have
the
right
to
rely
that
this
vessel,
the
tug
and
barge
will
obey
the
law
and
not
make
this
abrupt
u-turn.
mr.
kenneth
e.
roberts
when
--
that's
a
--
and
then
there
is
under
automobile
law
a
prima
facie
case
of
negligence
per
se
but
under
these
circumstances,
i
think
where
you
take
into
consideration,
the
steerage
rate
of
the
vessel,
the
testimony
of
the
helmsman
and
also
the
quartermaster
and
the
pilot,
i
think
and
the
visibility
that
was
prevailing
other
vessels
traversing
this
columbia
river
that
under
all
of
these
circumstances,
six
to
seven
knots
is
not
sufficient
to
show
fault
on
the
part
of
the
--
the
santa
maria.
i
just
think
that
the
mathematical
rule
of
half
the
distance
ahead
is
just
unworkable.
in
fact,
in
any
sort
of
a
speed
situation
case,
you're
going
to
have
fault
on
the
part
of
the
other
vessel
because
he
can't
come
along
under
the
pennsylvania
rule
and
show
that
the
speed
could
not
possibly
have
had
anything
to
do
with
it.
it
just
--
it
seems
to
be
inequitable
and
the
justice
of
this
situation,
in
my
opinion,
cries
out
for
some
remedy
to
avoid
the
consequences
of
this
ninth
circuit,
silver
palm
half-ahead
distance
rule.
now,
if
the
court
gets
to
the
question
that
we've
raised
secondly
in
this
case
as
to
the
division
of
damages.
again,
judge
wright
in
reversing
this
said,
“this
is
mutual
fault
and
therefore,
both
vessels
share
the
damage
on
a
50-50
basis.”
this
--
mr.
kenneth
e.
roberts
no,
there
was
no
reason
to
raise
it
mr.
justice
potter.
we
won
the
case
in
the
trial
court
and
we
never
anticipated
this.
so
we
raised
it
for
the
first
time
--
mr.
kenneth
e.
roberts
no,
they
would
not
have
listened
to
the
argument
i
--
in
my
opinion.
we
feel
that
this
50-50
mutual
fault
is
an
anachronism
on
the
present
authorities.
we're
the
only
maritime
nation
in
the
world
that
i
know
of
that
actually
adheres
to
it.
i
--
i
feel
that
is
a
very,
very
unfair
rule
as
demonstrated
by
the
facts
in
this
case.
even
judge
wright
in
his
opinion
finding
a
mutual
fault
said
that
the
fault
of
the
tug
and
barge
was
flagrant
and
it
was
shocking
to
--
to
some
extent.
i'd
say
that
this
case
very
aptly
demonstrates
the
inequities
of
the
mutual
fault
doctrine.
there
seems
to
be
no
doubt
that
most
of
the
shipping
industry,
the
lawyers,
the
maritime
law
association,
congress
to
some
extent,
or
at
least,
some
of
the
committees
of
congress
feel
that
the
rule
should
be
changed
and
that
the
vessel
should
be
charged
proportionately
--
proportionately
with
its
degree
of
fault.
mr.
kenneth
e.
roberts
no,
i
don't
think
so.
the
mutual
fault
doctrine
as
i
understand
it
and
read
the
cases
came
out
of
the
catherine
v.
dickinson
case.
it's
a
judge-made
law
and
if
it's
a
judge-made
law
then
the
judges
and
members
of
this
court
can
very
easily
change
it
as
very
definitely
demonstrated
in
the
hawn
versus
pope
&
talbot
where
this
court
said
the
contributory
negligence
was
not
at
bar
in
a
maritime
tort
situation
where
this
court
in
the
(inaudible)
case
said
that
there
is
a
cause
of
action
in
inland
waters
for
wrongful
death
based
on
unseaworthiness.
there
is
no
statutory
prohibition
in
any
way
preventing
this
court
from
changing
that
archaic
rule
of
mutual
fault
under
the
circumstances
or
any
of
the
circumstances
of
any
maritime
collision
as
we
have
--
demonstrated
by
the
terms
of
our
brief.
mr.
kenneth
e.
roberts
i'm
familiar
with
that
particular
case.
that
was
a
maritime
personal
injury
case
arising
out
of
a
maritime
personal
injury
case
and
it
was
indemnity
by
one
side
against
the
other
after
the
original
judgements
have
been
played
off.
in
that
particular
case
though,
as
to
the
merits
of
the
case
in
chief
that
supported
the
action
for
indemnity
comparative
rule
of
principles
where
in
fact
applied.
the
longshoreman
or
the
railroad
worker
working
on
the
barge
in
that
case,
if
he
was
contributory
or
negligent
--
or
if
he
was
negligent,
his
damages
were
reduced
to
the
degree
of
his
negligence,
so
comparative
negligence,
and
in
this
case,
we've
got
original
parties.
this
is
not
a
case
for
indemnity
and
that's
the
only
way
i
can
distinguish
this
particular
case
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
the
--
the
atlantic
railroad
case
certainly
and
all
maritime
cases
that
i
know
of,
the
jones
act,
the
longshore
and
harbor
workers
act
cases
and
so
forth,
comparative
negligence
has
been
applied
by
this
court
and
by
other
court
state
and
federal
in
determining
degree
of
fault
in
the
personal
injury
field.
the
only
difference
that
we
are
asking
you
to
do
at
this
time
is
to
make
it
uniform
and
apply
it
in
a
property
damage
case.
that's
all
we've
got
here
--
mr.
kenneth
e.
roberts
that's
exactly
--
mr.
kenneth
e.
roberts
and
--
and
i
think
that
type
of
a
situation
leads
to
litigation
because
you
get
a
situation
and
i
think
lawyers,
when
they
get
amongst
themselves
and
litigation
and
attend
to
be
fair
with
one
another
and
can
be
determined
based
on
the
facts,
the
relative
degrees
of
fault
of
their
two
vessels.
however,
where
--
you
get
a
situation
where
you
got
one,
obviously
90%
at
fault
and
another
--
a
vessel
may
be
only
10%
at
fault
and
may
be
it
was
a
statutory
fault
and
there's
nothing
to
do
with
contributory
--
approximate
course
elements
in
the
case
in
any
way
then
the
other
lawyers
are
going
to
ask
for
mutual
fault
--
mutual
fault
all
the
time
whereas,
if
we
had
a
comparative
fault
doctrine
and
a
gain
on
that
hypothetical,
maybe
they'd
settle
the
case
on
the
basis
of
8515
or
even
8020.
no
one
is
outraged
by
that
type
of
negotiation
and
settlement
and
i
think
it's
very,
very
proper
that
that
type
of
the
settlement
can
go
on
but
i
think,
it
cannot
go
on
in
this
particular
field
where
you
have
this
archaic,
what
i
consider
to
be
archaic,
outmoded
doctrine
of
mutual
fault.
and
i
don't
see
any
reason
at
all
from
a
legislative,
political,
or
social
purpose
why
the
united
states
should
be
the
only
maritime
nation
that
adopts
this
particular
mutual
fault.
mr.
kenneth
e.
roberts
pardon?
mr.
kenneth
e.
roberts
they
were
fairly
equal
in
this
case.
the
barge
was
the
only
one
that
sustained
collision
damage
because
the
tugboat
had
made
the
u-turn
and
the
tank
has
sustained
damage
on
its
port
bow
and
the
starboard
side
of
the
barge
sustained
damages.
there
was
a
little
more,
i
believe,
damage
on
the
barge
itself
that
which
would
mean
that
the
vessel,
my
client,
the
santa
maria
under
the
mutual
fault
doctrine
will
be
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
kenneth
e.
roberts
--
to
the
other
side.
mr.
kenneth
e.
roberts
and
that's
what
--
so
i
think
unfortunate
about
such
a
doctrine.
there
is
also
some
indication
that
it
leads
to
foreign
shopping.
that's
where
you
get
--
in
inland
waters
or
a
vessel
in
collision
with
another
they
will
try
and
get
it
to
the
united
states
court
for
the
simple
reason
that
the
court
would
basically
apply
the
law
of
the
forum
or
the
united
states
which
is
the
mutual
fault
of
doctrine
and
everything
went
down
like
middle
50-50.
also,
from
a
human
nature
viewpoint,
i
think
this
type
of
a
doctrine
tends
to
make
the
trial
judge
take
the
easy
way
out
in
all
sincerity
instead
of
really
looking
at
all
the
facts
that
judge
kilkenny
did
in
this
case
and
he
made
his
own
opinion
and
adopted
it
as
his
findings
there
is
some
inclination
to
say,
“well,
under
the
mutual
fault
doctrine,
all
i've
got
to
do
is
to
find
a
little,”
and
that's
the
end
of
the
case,
and
i
believe
that
the
doctrine
is
not
usable
anymore
and
that
this
court
should
overrule
it.
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
kenneth
e.
roberts
i
don't
think
that
does.
the
--
it's
not
all
insurance
companies,
some
of
these
vessels
as
the
court
knows
has
brought
very
large
deductibles
on
collision
liabilities
and
things
to
this
nature.
and
i
don't
think
the
absence
of
anyone
from
industry
or
from
the
maritime
law
association,
the
congressional
records
which
we
have
sighted
in
our
brief,
would
certainly
indicate
that
the
great
majority
of
the
people
concerned
in
this
field
would
likely
proportionate
fault
rule.
thank
you.
mr.
kenneth
e.
roberts
i
just
have
a
couple
of
remarks,
sir.
under
the
comparative
fault
doctrine,
mr.
wood
has
already
said
that
under
the
mutual
fault
doctrine,
the
non-carrying
vessel
puts
up
if
it's
10%
of
fault
now
it
still
gets
50%
back
from
the
carrying
vessel.
it
seems
to
me
that
if
it
gets
90%
back
from
the
carrying
vessel
based
on
comparative
fault
that
is
more
equitable
and
just
under
all
of
the
circumstances
and
i
can't
see
any
difference
or
validity
to
his
argument
between
the
50%
which
he
gets
back
now
and
the
90%
which
he'd
get
back
on
if
this
court
has
decided
to
--
to
adapt
the
comparative
fault
rule.
that's
all
i
have.
thank
you.
