justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
--
we
had
a
case
here
last
spring
involving
the
erie
railroad
company
where
we
were
asked
to
overrule
the
halcyon
lines
case
which
i
think
was
equally
a
judge-made
law
and
as
i
recall,
we
declined
to
do
it.
how
do
you
feel
your
basic
proposal
is
differs
from
that
made
by
the
petitioners
there?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
wood,
before
--
before
you
get
this,
let
me
ask
you
one
more
thing
about
the
rule
of
sight.
that
does
the
law
of
admiralty
couple
with
this
concept
that
the
rule
of
sight
some
concept
of
foreseeable
risk
as
you
had
in
the
cardozo's
opinion
in
the
palsgraf
case
or
proximate
cause
so
that
you're
only
liable
even
if
you've
breached
it
to
something
that
might
reasonably
have
been
foreseen
to
result
from
your
breach?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
would
it
be
unreasonable
to
say
here
from
the
point
of
view
of
those
expressed
down
(inaudible)
that
whereas
a
collision
on
a
port
to
port
passing
might
have
been
anticipated
in
a
fog,
a
collision
that
type
that
took
place
here
really
couldn't
have
been
anticipated
at
all?
