mr.

you

now
you
could

you
could
win
on
all
the
facts

not
when

you
--
chief

warren
e.
burger
if
you
don't
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
you're
saying
really
is
that
in
all
the
circumstances
shown
here,
the
master
and
the
pilot
of
the
tanker
had
a
virtually
an
absolute
right
to
assume
that
there
wasn't
going
to
be
a
u-turn
by
this
tugboat
and
its

chief

but
in
the
--
but
in
the
analogy
you
give
if
the

going
60
miles
an
hour
in
a
30-mile

but
where
do
we
stand

we
put

another
question,
do
we
stand
in
the

posture
here
as
failure
of

to
alter
legislation
when
they

chief

warren
e.

well,
isn't
the
record
here
that
these
were
patches?
chief

warren
e.
burger
but
the
experience
of
the
pilot
knowing
the
distance
would
not

be
able
to
estimate
the
speed
movement
of
the
tug
even
unseen,
would
he
not?
chief

but
isn't
--
now,
why
is
that
not
a
fair
assumption
on
the

of
this

isn't
that
a
reasonable
assumption?
chief

does
the

the
capacity

somewhat?

would
you
