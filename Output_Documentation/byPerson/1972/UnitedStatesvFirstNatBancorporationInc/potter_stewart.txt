potential

by
way
foothold.
justice
potter
stewart
you're
going
to
get,
are
you,
to
the
foothold?
justice
potter
stewart
because,
except
i
don't
--
that
was
a
new
one
to
me
--
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i
think
i
understand
it,
but
i
hadn't
seen
any
--
it
didn't
ring
any
bells
with
me
in
opinions
of
this
court.
justice
potter
stewart
in
your
view,
is
it
even
better
to
be
a
foothold
entrant
than
an
independent
entrant,
from
the
point
of
view
of
section
7?
justice
potter
stewart
is
this
--
is
this
document
developed
in
the
--
in
the
courts
of
appeals
or
the
district
courts?
justice
potter
stewart
over
in
your
department?
justice
potter
stewart
when
did
you
say
that
the
present
day
movement
began
more
or
less?
justice
potter
stewart
yeah.
justice
potter
stewart
this
is
--
this
is
entirely
a
one-way
street,
however,
isn't
it?
if
you'd
answered
your
question
yes,
we
would
have.
we
couldn't
get
in.
this
way
we
would
have
gone
in
independently.
you
certainly
wouldn't
want
the
court
to
disregard
that
evidence,
would
you?
justice
potter
stewart
is
subjective
evidence,
is
it
not?
justice
potter
stewart
yes,
with
regard
that's
admission
against
interest
and
you
get
it
in
under
that
rule,
would
you?
justice
potter
stewart
and
if
he
said
---
if
he
answers
the
question
no,
as
to
be
wholly
disregarded,
and
if
he
answers
the
question
yes,
i'm
sure
he
would
not
say.
justice
potter
stewart
or
else
by
contrast
to
you
in
pretrial,
discovery
proceedings
that
found
some
inter
office
memorandum
from
one
executive
to
the
other,
saying
if
we
get
turned
on
--
on
it
down
on
this
acquisition,
we'll
try
to
go
in
there
independently.
you
would
find
that
extremely
helpful
i'm
sure,
would
you?
justice
potter
stewart
and
that
would
entirely
subjective.
so
it's
really,
the
test
isn't
whether
it's
subjective
or
objective,
is
it?
justice
potter
stewart
now,
you've
--
in
previous
cases,
you'd
use
it
much
more
than
on
a
confirmatory
basis.
