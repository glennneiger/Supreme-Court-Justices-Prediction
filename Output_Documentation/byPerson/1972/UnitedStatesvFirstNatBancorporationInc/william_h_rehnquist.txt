justice

mr.
friedman,
isn't
the
--
the
question
being
though,
it
was
before
judge
doyle
in
this
case,
basically
a
factual
one?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
didn't
he
in
his
opinion
also
refer
to
consideration
of
objective
evidence
which
he
found
led
to
the
same
conclusion
as
the
subjective
evidence?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
friedman,
are
you
saying
that
the
court
can
properly
consider
evidence
of
the
subjective
intent
in
making
the
ultimate
determination?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
of
course,
without
any
new
rule
of
law,
the
district
court
is
perfectly
free
to
disbelieve
or
discount
the
witness's
testimony
just
on
the
ground
you
suggest,
isn't
it?
he
doesn't
need
any
new
principle
of
law
to
do
that.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
was
that
evidence
before
the
district
court
in
the
trial
of
this
case?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
can
we
consider
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
do
we
ordinarily
limit
ourselves
though,
in
a
factual
question
like
this,
to
what
was
put
in,
in
the
record
in
the
district
court?
