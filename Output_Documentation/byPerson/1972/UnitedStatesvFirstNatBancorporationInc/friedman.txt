mr.
friedman
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
a
direct
appeal
from
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
district
of
colorado
which
at
trial
dismissed
a
government
antitrust
suit,
challenging
a
bank
merger
is
violating
section
7
of
the
clayton
act.
the
merger
involved
the
acquisition
by
the
first
bancorporation
of
colorado,
the
second
largest
bank
holding
company
in
colorado
of
the
first
national
bank
of
greeley
which
is
the
second
largest
bank
in
the
city
of
greeley.
the
holding
company
which
i
shall
refer
to
as
bancorporation,
does
not,
through
any
of
its
subsidiaries,
operate
in
the
city
of
greeley.
so,
this
means
that
the
acquiring
firm
and
the
acquired
firm
are
not
themselves
direct
competitors.
the
theory
of
the
government's
case,
was
that
the
bancorporation
was
a
potential
entrant
into
the
greeley
market
and
that
by
acquiring
the
bank
in
greeley,
the
effect
was
to
remove
the
competitive
effect,
that
the
presence
of
this
potential
entrant
had
on
the
outside
of
the
market
on
the
theory
that
had
it
not
been
for
the
acquisition,
there
was
a
reasonable
probability
that
this
acquiring
firm,
the
holding
company,
would
either
itself
have
entered
the
market
for
acquiring
a
small
bank
or
from
opening
a
new
bank
in
the
greeley
area.
mr.
friedman
no,
no,
of
course
not,
of
course,
not
mr.
chief
justice.
the
--
first
of
all,
our
argument
is
that,
in
view
of
all
the
circumstances
shown
here,
under
the
proper
standard,
in
fact,
this
corporation
was
a
potential
entrant
at
the
time
it
made
the
acquisition.
we
do
not
say
that
the
mere
fact
that
made
the
acquisition
made
it
a
potential
entrant.
what
we
do
say
is,
that
in
this
kind
of
a
situation,
where
the
firm,
as
i
shall
develop,
was
interested
in
the
market,
whereas
an
attractive
market,
where
as
the
record
shows,
they
were
interested
in
going
into
all
the
markets
and
where
it
was
an
attractive
thing
to
prudent
management
that
is
enough
to
make
it,
we
think,
a
potential
entrant,
and
then
the
next
question,
of
course,
is
whether
the
elimination
of
that
potential
entrant
may
have
the
effect
substantially,
to
lessen
competition
in
violation
of
section
7.
mr.
friedman
that's
correct
mr.
justice.
there
are
claimants
that
they
were
a
potential
entrant
here
in
both
ways.
mr.
friedman
oh,
yes.
mr.
friedman
well,
let
me
explain
it
right
now.
mr.
friedman
no
--
well,
i
think
this
court
does
not
say
so,
but
the
concept
is
a
very
simple,
one
which
is,
if
you
have
concentrated
market,
where
two
or
three
firms
own
a
major
share
of
the
--
have
a
major
share
of
the
business
as
it's
true
in
greeley,
if
an
outside
firm
comes
in
and
merely
succeeds
to
the
share
of
the
market
held
by
one
of
these
large
firms,
this
merely
solidifies
the
existing
relationship.
it
tends
to
--
to
tie
up
the
existing
structure.
on
the
other
hand,
if
a
large
firm
comes
into
the
market
by
acquiring
a
smaller
firm
in
the
market,
this
means
that
the
only
way
of
the
large
firm
can
hope
to
achieve
a
substantial
share
of
the
market
is
by
engaging
in
very
vigorous
competition.
and
it
also,
it
seems
to
me
self-evident
that
a
very
large
firm
is
not
going
to
acquire
a
small
firm
in
the
market
unless
it
believes
and
hopes
that
it
can
build
it
up,
and
these
are
--
the
theory
of
it
that
this
kind
of
an
entry
will
inject
into
the
market
a
new
competitive
force
which
is
not
present
in
the
usual
concentrated
market.
mr.
friedman
that
i
--
we
--
we
--
i
don't
know
mr.
justice.
both
of
them,
we
think,
both
of
them
we
think
are
desirable
in
changing
the
structure
of
concentrated
markets,
in
a
sense
--
in
a
sense,
perhaps,
the
acquisition
of
a
small
little
firm
in
the
market
which
up
to
this
time
by
definition
has
not
been
a
very
effective
competitor,
that's
almost
the
equivalent
of
going
in
by
yourself
because
you
start
with
a
little
one
that
says,
though,
you
just
started
it
and
try
to
build
it
up,
and
get
a
larger
share
of
the
market
and
compete
vigorously
in
this
market.
mr.
friedman
no,
no,
i
think
it's
merely
developed
by
the
--
mr.
friedman
--
by
the
government,
mr.
justice.
and
the
--
unfortunately,
i
had
to
say
it
is
not
thus
far,
been
persuasive
to
the
district
courts
that
we
consider
it
but
we
hope
it
will
be
to
this
court.
mr.
friedman
it's
basically
a
factual
one
mr.
justice,
but
we
think
in
resolving
that
question,
judge
doyle,
we
think,
applied
the
wrong
standards
for
determining,
what
is
a
potential
entrant.
that
--
that
is,
we
think
the
judge
applied
what
we
call
the
subjective
standard,
the
standard
based
on
the
express
intent
of
the
corporate
official,
as
the
official
as
to
what
they
would
do,
and
we
don't
think
that
is
the
proper
standard
as
i
shall
develop
in
the
light
of
the
congressional
purposes
in
such
so.
mr.
friedman
he
--
he
spoke
of
objective
evidence,
but
i
--
i
think
mr.
justice,
once
again,
what
he
meant
by
objective
evidence
was
largely
the
--
the
testimony
plus
the
fact
that
he
was
impressed,
i
think,
by
what
he
felt
was
the
unlikelihood
in
terms
of
the
management-stated
prior
program
and
of
plans
of
their
going
in.
he
--
he
did
not,
it
seems,
to
us,
address
himself
to
the
standards
that
we
think
are
the
controlling
of
this.
now,
i
would
like
just
by
a
way
of
background,
give
a
little
bit
of
the
history
of
the
bank
merger
movement
in
this
country.
in
the
late,
in
the
year,
we
--
in
late
1950s,
we
had
a
tremendous
way
of
back
mergers
in
the
major
cities
of
this
country.
competing
banks
joined.
they
formed
these
huge
banks
and
manufactures,
hand
over
morgan
guaranty
in
new
york
and
this
merger
went
on
for
awhile
and
finally
the
government
began
to
bring
suits
against
these
mergers.
and
when
this
court
in
1963
decided
in
the
philadelphia
bank
case,
that
section
7
of
the
clayton
act
applied
to
bank
mergers,
that
basically
marked
the
end
of
this
aspect
of
the
bank
merger
movement
in
this
country,
because
that
case
established
the
two
large
banks
having
a
significant
share
of
the
market
where
competitors
cannot
combine.
mr.
friedman
the
movement
i
discussed
i
think
--
mr.
friedman
--
began
in
the
late
1940s
to
the
early
1950s.
but
the
next
phase
of
this
movement,
which
i
am
coming
to,
i
think
began
in
the
early
1960s.
and
that
was
the
tendency
by
the
large
banks
in
the
big
cities
to
move
into
many
of
the
local
regional
markets,
the
smallest
cities
by
the
acquisition
of
the
most
important
banks
in
those
areas.
that
is
in
states
with
permitted
branch-banking
a
large
bank
would
move
into
a
local
area
by
buying
the
first,
the
second,
the
third,
largest
bank
in
the
city.
in
areas
that
did
not
permit
branch-banking,
the
holding
company
movement
developed
whereby
a
holding
company
was
formed
with
a
large
a
bank
as
its
nucleus
and
this
holding
company
in
turn
proceeded
to
acquire
various
banks
in
the
large
cities.
this
trend
developed
very
rapidly
and
there's
an
exhibit
in
the
record,
defendants
exhibit
30,
at
page
1662,
which
is
a
table
showing
as
of
the
end
1969,
the
percentages
of
the
total
state
bank
deposits
held
by
the
three
largest
and
the
five
largest
banks.
and
this
shows
that
in
17
states,
one-third
of
the
states
by
1969,
17
--
i'm
sorry,
the
three
largest
banking
organizations
in
the
state
had
more
than
50%
of
the
total
deposits.
and
in
24
states,
it
was
the
five
largest
banks
that
had
more
than
that
percentage
of
the
deposits.
now,
this
trend
was
also
present
in
colorado.
in
1960,
there
was
one
holding
company
operating
in
colorado
that
had
three
banks
and
4.4%
of
the
deposits.
by
1970,
there
were
seven
holding
companies
operating
in
colorado.
they
had
41
banks.
and
while
the
41
banks
were
less
than
one-fifth
of
the
total
banks
in
the
state,
they
had
51%
of
the
deposits
in
colorado.
so,
we
see
that
what
has
been
happening
in
colorado
is
what
has
been
happening
throughout
the
rest
of
the
country
in
varying
degree.
the
large
banks
--
the
large
banks
in
the
cities
through
these
holding
companies
have
been
going
out
and
acquiring
major
competitors
in
the
local
markets.
now,
the
greeley
area
itself,
has
felt
this
trend.
there
are
eight
banking
organizations
in
greeley,
prior
to
this
acquisition.
four
of
them
were
owned
by
two
colorado
holding
companies
and
they
had
60%
of
the
deposits
in
the
greeley
area.
and
it's
against
this
background,
this
history,
of
a
merger
movement
in
the
banking
field
that
the
acquisition
by
more
and
more
of
the
local
banking
leaders
throughout
the
state,
that
the
effect
of
this
merger
in
the
greeley
area
must
be
--
get
based.
now
denver
is
the
commercial
and
banking
center
of
colorado,
but
in
addition
to
this,
there
were
six
other
important
banking
centers,
smaller
cities
in
colorado
of
which
greeley
is
one.
the
holding
company
was
formed
in
1968
by
the
officials
of
the
principal
bank
in
the
system,
the
first
national
bank
which
is
the
second
largest
bank
in
the
city
of
--
i'm
sorry,
it's
above
myself
--
is
the
largest
bank
in
the
city
of
denver.
it's
a
bank
with
assets
of
approximately
$500
million.
it
also
has
three
smaller
banks
in
the
denver
suburbs
which
were
organized
by
the
people
who
were
the
principals
of
the
first
national
bank
of
denver
prior
to
the
time
the
holding
company
was
formed.
and
in
his
deposition,
the
president
of
the
holding
company
testified
that
one
reason
his
people
formed
this
holding
company
was
because
of
the
trend
in
colorado
of
other
bank
holding
companies
acquiring
banks.
that's
shown
at
page
535
of
the
record.
now,
in
its
first
annual
report
to
its
stockholders,
the
--
the
holding
company
explained
what
its
purpose
was,
what
it
was
going
to
do.
it
said
and
this
is
at
page
513
of
the
record.
he
said,
“the
policy
of
our
company
is
to
expand
as
rapidly
and
as
wisely
as
possible,
through
the
acquisition
of
other
banks
in
colorado
and
it's
a
(inaudible)
banks
which
held
out
of
good
potential
for
growth
and
through
other
legally
permissible
investments
and
activities.”
now,
this
thought
was
repeated
in
a
deposition,
again,
given
by
the
president
of
the
holding
company
which
he
said
at
pages
535
to
536
of
the
record,
“we
would
like
to
have
a
bank
in
the
major
cities
of
colorado.”
they
want
--
they
wanted
a
bank
in
major
cities
of
colorado
and
he
also
listed
various
other
areas
where
they
would
like
to
be.
and
then
he
was
asked
whether
in
their
plans
the
holding
company
had
ruled
out
the
possibility
of
de
novo
expansion,
because
the
report,
they
spoke
about
acquiring
other
banks
and
he
said,
“no,
we
haven't
ruled
out
that
possibility.”
the
first
step
in
this
program
of
expanding
into
the
various
local
areas
was
the
acquisition
in
greeley.
that
was
the
first
one.
since
that
time,
bancorporation
has
attempted
to
acquire
five
other
banks
in
various
areas
of
colorado.
two
of
the
proposed
acquisitions
were
the
largest
banks
in
the
particular
areas.
two
others
were
of
the
second
largest
banks.
they've
not
been
successful
in
this
in
endeavor,
and
one
of
them,
they
were
able
to
accomplish.
at
two
instances,
the
regulatory
authorities
turned
them
down.
in
one
instance,
the
acquisition
was
approved,
but
was
abandoned
when
the
government
filed
a
suit,
and
the
last
one,
we
still
have
a
suit
against
it
pending.
but
to
us,
the
significant
setting
is
to
show
that
the
first
bancorporation
was
not
just
sitting
idly
by
with
its
three
or
four
banks
and
waiting.
it
was
going
out
trying
to
acquire
other
banks
in
the
area.
now,
the
city
of
greeley
is
15
miles,
approximately
north
of
denver.
the
city
has
a
population
of
38,000.
the
greeley
area
which
has
certain
surrounding
communities
which
the
district
court
held
here
to
be
the
relevant
market
has
a
population
of
58,000.
it
has
mainly
been
an
agricultural
community,
but
in
the
last
decade,
industry
has
come
up
in
substantial
measure.
the
areas
had
a
good,
steady
growth
as
we
set
out
in
our
brief
at
page
9,
to
give
some
statistics.
and
this
is
an
area
that
is
attractive
to
bancorporation.
now,
our
opponent
suggests
that
there
was
no
particular
reason
why
this
company
should
have
gone
into
greeley,
that
there
are
more
attractive
markets
involved.
but
i
would
like
to
read
to
the
court
two
quotations.
unfortunately,
we
did
not
cite
this
in
our
brief
from
page
555.
and
this
is
the
man
named
“adams”
who
is
the
present
of
the
first
national
bank
of
denver
and
a
previous
president
of
the
bancorporation,
and
he
was
asked
on
this
deposition
why
the
bank
was
interested
in
acquiring
the
bank
in
greeley,
and
what
he
said
was
in
the
middle
of
the
page,
“we
were
very
anxious
as
i
say
to
get
into
the
greeley
area,
because
it
is
one
of
the
best
towns
in
northern
colorado
and
has
been
for
many,
many,
many
years
a
great
agricultural
area
and
a
fine
area.
and
we
would
very
much
like
to
have
a
unit
up
there
in
greeley.”
that
at
the
bottom
of
the
page
he
repeated
this
quote,
when
he
said,
“it
is
one
of
the
growth
areas
of
colorado
and
we'd
like
to
be
in
it.”
now,
the
greeley
market,
as
i
indicated
before,
is
a
concentrated
market.
the
three
principle
banking
organizations
have
92%
of
the
deposits.
the
acquired
bank,
first
national
of
greeley
is
approximately
the
same
size
as
the
larger
bank
within
a
--
a
10th
of
1%,
percentage
wise,
roughly,
32%
of
the
market.
and
the
first
national
bank
is
the
only
bank
in
the
area,
the
only
largest
bank
in
the
area
that
is
not
owned
by
a
holding
company.
now,
the
district
court
in
deciding
this
case
stated
that
the
issue
was
whether
if
there
would
be
--
there
would
be,
not
there
may
be,
he
said,
“whether
there
would
be
a
substantial
lessening
of
competition”.
and
the
court
concluded
that
the
government
had
to
show
that
the
acquisition
in
question
has
the
effect,
substantially,
to
lessen
competition.
now,
the
court
agreed
with
the
government
that
commercial
banking
is
the
relevant
product
market
and
found,
although,
the
government
had
suggested
two
alternatives,
found
that
the
greeley
area
was
the
relevant
geographical
market.
the
district
court
also
recognized
that
the
elimination
of
a
potential
competitor
may
have
the
effect
of
substantially
lessening
competition
in
violation
of
section
7.
the
court
said,
“where
the
concentration
is
high,
the
merger
removes
the
potential
competitor
as
a
restraining
influence
and
the
anticompetitive
effects
can
be
significant.”
the
court
went
it
on
--
and
they
hold
however,
that
this
merger
did
not
eliminate
a
substantial
competitor,
sorry,
a
substantial
entrant.
since
the
court
said
that
the
evidence
was
uncontradicted
that
bancorporation
has
no
intention
of
entering
the
greeley
market
if
this
acquisition
is
disapproved.
and
we
think
primarily
that
the
district
court
relied
on
two
bits
of
evidence.
one
was
the
testimony
of
an
official
of
bancorporation
that
they
would
not
enter
the
market.
and
secondly,
the
testimony
of
state
regulatory
officials
which
the
district
court
interpreted
as
indicating,
they
would
not
charter
a
new
bank
in
the
greeley
area.
the
court
did
not
reach
because
of
its
disposition
that
the
government
had
not
shown
anticompetitive
effect.
the
second
issue
under
the
bank
holding
company
act
is
the
same
as
under
the
bank
merger
act
whether
any
anticompetitive
effect
of
the
acquisition
are
clearly
outweighed
by
the
effect
of
the
merger
in
serving
the
convenience
and
needs
of
the
community.
so,
that
issue
has
not
been
resolved
and
if
the
court
agrees
with
us
that
the
wrong
standards
were
applied
then
the
case
has
to
be
remanded,
that
is
an
issue
for
the
district
court
to
deal
with
on
remand.
the
court
also
rejected
an
alternative
ground
on
which
the
government
challenged
the
merger.
that
is,
that
the
effect
of
this
merger
was
to
foreclose
to
competing
large
banks
in
colorado,
so-called
correspondent
banking.
that
is
the
practice
by
which
the
large
city
banks
perform
various
cervices
for
the
country
banks,
such
as
clearing
checks,
making
loans
in
excess
of
the
local
banks,
when
it's
giving
them
investment
advice,
serving
as
a
depository
for
various
funds.
and
the
government
claims
that
by
preempting
the
correspondent
banking
business
of
first,
of
greeley,
the
effect
of
the
merger
was
to
foreclose
to
the
other
banks
in
colorado
a
significant
important
share
of
this
business
and
that
in
the
light
of
the
trend
toward
concentration
in
the
colorado
banking
field,
this
also
had
an
anticompetitive
effect.
this
argument
is
a
rather
detailed
and
technical
one.
it
turns
on
questions
of
defining
the
market
on
disputes
as
to
the
irrelevant
statistics
involved.
it's
not
particularly
appropriate
for
oral
argument
and
i
propose
to
leave
that
discussion
to
the
brief.
now,
as
i
indicated,
the
district
court
didn't
question
that
the
elimination
of
potential
competition
may
substantially
lessen
the
competition.
and
this
court
has
repeatedly
so
indicated.
and
as
i've
also
indicated,
we
think
the
primary
issue
in
this
case,
therefore,
is
the
standard
for
determining
whether
a
firm
is
a
potential
entrant.
the
1950
amendments,
the
(inaudible)
act,
to
section
of
7
of
the
clayton
act,
reflected
the
rising
concern
--
i'm
sorry,
the
concern
of
congress
over
the
rising
trend
of
concentration
in
american
industry
and
congress
was
concerned
that
this
trend
or
concentration
would
result
in
a
further
weakening
of
a
normal
--
forces
of
competition
in
the
marketplace.
and
accordingly,
congress
strengthened
the
prohibitions
of
the
clayton
act
against
mergers
which
may
have
an
anticompetitive
effect.
the
purpose
of
section
7
as
amended
was
to
maintain
the
structure
of
the
market.
unlike
such
in
one
of
the
sherman
act
which
is
directed
to
conduct
in
the
market
anticompetitive
acts,
we
think
section
7
is
designed
to
preserve
the
structure,
to
avoid
changes
in
the
organization
of
the
market
that
pose
a
serious
danger
of
anticompetitive
effects
as
it's
repeatedly
been
stated
in
section
7.
in
1950,
congress
was
concerned
with
--
not
with
certainties
but
with
probabilities.
it
was
designed
to
stop
these
things
in
their
incipiency.
now,
in
a
market
where
you
have
many
sellers,
a
large
number
of
sellers,
none
of
whom
has
any
significant
major
share
of
the
market,
normally,
we
know
that
competition
plays
the
role
of
regulating
the
market.
but
when
you
get
into
these
concentrative
markets,
where
a
small
number
of
sellers
have
the
major
share
of
the
market
and
each
one
has
a
very
large
share,
economic
theory
teaches
that
in
that
situation,
what's
likely
to
develop
is
not
the
normal
competition
but
parallel
policies,
easy
accommodation.
and
therefore,
traditionally
markets
that
have
a
small
number
of
firms
with
a
large
share
are
not
characterized
by
the
kind
of
vigorous
competition
normally
found
in
traditional
markets.
and
that
principle,
that
concentration
is
inimicable
to
the
free
play
of
competitive
forces
is
also
applicable
to
banking.
as
this
court
stated
in
the
philadelphia
bank
case,
there
is
no
reason
to
think
that
concentration
is
less
inimicable
to
the
free
play
of
competition
in
banking
than
in
any
other
services.
now,
as
i
have
indicated,
the
potential
entrants
standing
on
the
outside
of
a
concentrated
market
has
two
roles
to
play,
two
roles
in
preserving
the
competitive
structure
of
the
market.
first
of
all,
standing
outside
the
market
inevitably
plays
an
influence
on
the
people
inside
the
market.
that
is
the
firms
inside
the
market
who
have
this
great
economic
power
are
well
aware
that
if
they
abused
it,
if
they
get
too
greedy
in
their
practices,
there's
always
the
danger
of
this
strong
firm
coming
in
and
taking
away
from
the
firms
that
hold
a
major
share
of
the
market,
a
section
of
that
market.
and
indeed
this
court
and
its
penn-olin
opinion
at
378
u.s.
at
page
174,
quoted
with
approval
from
a
t.n.e.c.
monograph
written
30
years
ago
which
directly
reflected
that
principle
and
it's
also
reflected
in
the
testimony
of
our
economic
expert,
professor
welch.
mr.
friedman
that
is
correct,
fairly
recently.
mr.
friedman
no,
i
--
no
i
would
not.
that,
in
fact
--
that's
one
of
our
major
contentions
is,
that
we
think
that
bancorporation
instead
of
acquiring
this
large
firm,
this
is
one
of,
we
think,
one
of
the
proper
ways
for
a
large
firm
to
get
into
a
concentrated
market.
this
firm
has
been
charted
by
a
small
holding
company,
a
small
holding
company
in
colorado.
the
claim
is
that
bancorporation
couldn't
have
gotten
a
charter.
that's
one
of
the
claims.
they
rely
--
they
say
that
the
testimony
by
the
state
banking
commission
indicates
that
because
charters
had
been
turned
down
in
other
localities,
there
was
no
chance
that
a
charter
would
have
been
granted
for
another
bank
greeley.
less
than
a
year
later,
lo
and
behold,
someone
did
come
in
and
seek
a
charter
for
new
bank
in
greeley
and
it
was
granted.
and
there's
no
reason
to
think
that
if
bancorporation
instead
of
seeking
to
make
this
acquisition
had
itself
going
in,
looked
for
an
application
for
new
a
charter
that
it
wouldn't
have
been
granted,
too.
mr.
friedman
no
--
no
we
don't
--
we
don't
contend
it's
under
bank,
mr.
justice.
what
we
do
contend
is
that
greeley
was
a
growing
area
where
there's
room
for
additional
banks,
and
that
the
creation
of
new
competition
in
greeley
would
tend
to
shake
up
this
market
which
had
been
relatively
static
before
then.
now,
the
other
role
of
a
potential
competitor
play
one
role
--
the
potential
competitor
sits
on
the
outside
and
in
effect
inhibits
anticompetitive
behavior
by
the
large
firms
in
the
market.
the
other
role,
equally
significant,
is
if
the
potential
competitor
enters
the
market.
if
a
potential
competitor
enters
the
market,
either
by
acquiring
a
small
bank
or
by
itself
organizing
the
bank,
this
again
tends
to
inject
into
what
has
been
basically
and
not
very
competitive
off
the
market,
a
new
competition.
now,
of
course,
as
long
as
the
potential
competitor
remains
outside,
it
has
these
salutary
purposes.
but
once
it
enters
by
acquiring
a
market
leader,
two
things
happen.
whatever
effect
it
has
staying
on
the
outside
disappears
and
the
possibility
of
any
vigorous
and
new
competition
by
creation
of
a
new
competitor
disappears.
all
at
you
have
in
this
type
of
a
situation
is
that
the
outside
powerful
firm
comes
in
and
takes
over
the
market
share
of
one
of
the
major
banks
in
the
area.
now,
the
significance
that
an
outside
potential
entrant
has
on
competition
in
the
market,
basically
depends
on
the
relationship
between
this
bank
and
the
structure
of
the
market,
that
is,
what
kind
of
a
market
is
it,
what
is
its
role
on
the
outside,
is
it
a
concentrated
market
of
the
facts
such
as
to
indicate
that
the
bank
is
likely
to
come
in.
and
that
of
course
it
seems
to
me
is
the
kind
of
a
question
that
has
to
be
determined
on
the
basis
of
the
objective
evidence
in
the
case,
not
on
the
basis
of
the
intent
of
the
parties
--
the
stated
intent
of
the
firm.
it
seems
to
us
that
this
is
just
not
the
way
in
which
this
kind
of
a
determination
should
be
made.
mr.
friedman
i
would
not
go
so
far
as
to
say
that
cannot
consider
it
but
certainly
the
court
can't
base
it
on
that
fact
and
i
think
it's
entitled
to
very
little
weight.
and
let
me
--
if
i
may
explain
particularly
with
reference
to
this
kind
of
testimony,
the
question
basically.
it
is
--
is
asked
in
this
case,
as
is,
had
you
not
been
permitted
to
make
the
acquisition,
would
you
have
gone
in
either
through
making
a
small
acquisition
or
by
organizing
your
own
bank.
and
almost
invariably,
as
is
true
in
this
case,
the
answer
is
no,
we
would
not.
now,
this
is
a
question
put
to
a
witness
after
the
witness
has
already
made
the
decision
to
go
in
by
the
acquisition
route.
and
it
--
it's
just,
almost,
psychologically
impossible
for
someone
to
give
an
objective
valuation
as
to
what
he
would
have
done,
had
there
not
been
this
situation.
mr.
friedman
no,
but
we're
not
--
we're
--
what
i
was
suggesting
mr.
justice,
is
that
is
just
not
a
very
reliable
basis
upon
which
to
make
the
kind
of
a
judgment
involved
in
this
area
because
it
--
it's
subject
to
--
to
many
problems.
mr.
friedman
now,
well,
i
think
the
strongest
--
the
strongest
evidence
of
his
intention
to
go
unless
it'd
say
--
mr.
friedman
well,
but
--
but
i
--
i
think
it's
a
---
it's
a
different
situation,
mr.
justice,
it's
a
very
different
situation.
mr.
friedman
perhaps.
i
--
i
think
the
difference
is
this,
mr.
justice.
in
the
one
case
--
in
the
one
case,
he's
being
asked
in
effect
a
hypothetical
question,
what
he
--
what
they
would
have
done,
had
they
not
done
what
they
decided
to
do.
and
this
seems
to
me
gets
–-
mr.
friedman
i
don't
say
that
he'd
wholly
disregard,
but
i
--
i
think
it's
something
that
cannot
be
dispositive
or
given
great
way.
mr.
friedman
i'm
sure
i
would.
mr.
friedman
well,
it's
whether
it's
--
the
test
--
let
me
make,
if
i
may
suggest,
in
there
and
hypothetically
you
oppose
to
finding
the
document
that
support
our
case,
i
think
we
would
say
that
just
confirms
what
the
other
evidence
shows.
mr.
friedman
well,
it
is.
it's
--
it's
obviously
of
subsequence.
let
me
explain
another
thing
here,
another
reason
why
we
think
this
kind
of
intent
testimony
is
not,
preferably
persuasive.
one
of
the
effects,
one
of
the
substantial
impacts
that
the
presence
of
an
outside
competitor
has
is
on
the
conduct
of
the
people
in
the
market.
the
knowledge
of
this
and
the
outside
competitor
on
the
(inaudible)
and
the
people
who
are
in
the
market
have
to
make
their
judgment,
have
to
influence
their
practices
on
the
basis
of
what
they
judge
from
the
objective
evidence.
that
is,
they
look
and
see
what
kind
of
a
firm
in
this,
what
is
happening
in
the
market,
whether
it
has
the
capacity
to
come
in,
whether
it
looks
like
the
kind
of
an
opportunity
--
would
be
attractive
for
them.
they
don't
know.
they
don't
know
and
can't
make
their
business
judgments
on
the
basis
of
what
may
be
in
the
minds
of
the
officials
of
the
outside
company.
now,
i
think
one
other
bit
of
evidence
that
is
quite
significant
in
deciding
how
you
evaluate
these
claims
that
they
wouldn't
go
in,
otherwise,
is
what
has
actually
happened
in
colorado
and
in
other
states
where
bank
holding
companies
have
sought
and
been
denied
permission
to
the
enter
the
markets,
to
acquiring
a
large
share.
and
when
that
was
turned
down
and
that
failed
they
would
then
go
in
and
try
to
acquire
a
smaller
bank.
a
very
interesting
example
is
this
very
holding
company,
bancorporation.
and
in
addition,
united
banks
of
colorado,
the
largest
holding
company
in
this
state,
each
of
them
tried
to
acquire
one
of
the
leading
banks
in
a
large
community,
failed.
and
then
preceeded
to
try
to
acquire
and
succeeded
a
much
smaller
bank.
bancorporation
tried
to
acquire
the
leading
bank
in
colorado
springs.
and
it's
--
i
--
i'm
sorry,
the
second
largest
bank
in
colorado
springs,
and
when
it,
in
its
application
to
the
federal
reserve
board,
it
said
it
would
be
imprudent
for
it.
imprudent
was
the
word
they'd
used,
to
try
to
get
into
the
market
either
by
acquiring
a
smaller
bank
or
by
opening
its
own
bank.
the
fed
approved
that,
but
the
merger
was
abandoned
when
the
government
filed
an
antitrust
suit.
bancorporation
then
turned
around
and
applied
for
and
got
permission,
to
acquire
a
bank
in
colorado
springs
that
was
one-seventh
the
size
of
the
bank
they
originally
had
sought.
mr.
friedman
i
don't
believe
it
--
i
don't
believe
that
evidence
was,
but
it
seems
to
us
--
mr.
friedman
well,
it's
all
the
matter
of
public
record
mr.
justice.
these
are
reports
of
government
regulatory
authorities
deciding
these
cases.
mr.
friedman
normally
so,
mr.
justice,
but
i'm
just
suggesting
that
this
subsequent
evidence
confirms
our
claim
that
the
kind
of
evidence
that
the
district
court
relied
on
in
this
case,
is
not
a
reliable
basis
for
deciding
these
questions.
one
last
point
i
would
make
is
the
testimony
of
the
regulatory
officials,
of
the
court
relied
on.
again,
this
is
a
wholly
conjectural
type
of
evidence.
he's
asked
whether
he
would
or
wouldn't
charter
a
new
bank,
and
he
said,
he
had
recommended
he
would
charter
a
new
bank
within
five
years.
well,
regulatory
officials
decide
questions
of
whether
they
charter
a
new
bank
on
the
basis
on
an
application
to
that
is
filed
to
them.
they
consider
all
the
facts.
they
have
also
sorts
of
detailed
specifications.
all
he
said
was
that
he
wouldn't
recommend
to
his
superior
the
controller
of
the
currency.
it's
the
controller
of
the
currency
who
makes
the
decision.
conditions
change.
perhaps,
he
would
not
have
recommended
the
chartering
of
a
new
bank
in
greeley
at
the
time
of
the
trial.
in
two
years
he
might
have
used
regulatory
officials
also
(inaudible)
mr.
friedman
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i'd
like
to
turn
out
one
other
important
aspect
of
this
case
and
that
is
the
reason
why
we
think
that
bancorporation's
elimination
was
a
potential,
and
it
was
particularly
significant
because
bancorporation,
we
believe,
was
one
of
the
few
firms
in
the
state
of
colorado
that
was
likely
to
be
an
important
and
significant
competitor.
our
opponents
tell
us
that
bancorporation
was
insignificant
as
a
potential
and
i
think
they
say,
“anybody
can
organize
a
bank.”
they
say,
“it's
not
very
difficult,
a
few
people
get
together,
get
together
a
little
capital
and
organize
a
bank.”
that's
quite
true,
of
course,
but
it's
only,
we
think,
a
large
bank,
a
bank
with
the
resources,
that
bancorporation
has
that
does
hold
out
a
real
potential
for
shaking
up
this
market.
now,
there
are,
at
the
present
time,
in
the
state
of
colorado
that
work
upon
this
acquisition,
seven
holding
companies.
two
of
them
are
already
operating
in
the
greeley
market.
the
third
one,
a
very
large
holding
company
called
western
bancorporation,
a
multibillion-dollar
concern
under
federal
law
is
precluded
from
having
anymore
banks
in
colorado,
so
that
takes
care
of
three.
one
of
these
other
holding
companies
is
quite
small.
it's
no
larger,
basically,
than
the
bank
to
be
acquired,
that's
four.
now
the
remaining
three
in
the
state
of
colorado,
bancorporation
is
by
far
the
largest.
in
fact,
it's
about
twice
as
large
as
the
other
two.
so
that
it
seems
to
us
that
viewing
this
whole
situation
in
colorado
that
bancorporation
is
now
the
leading
holding
company,
the
biggest
holding
company
that
is
not
in
the
market
and
is
a
firm
that
has
indicated
its
intention
of
going
into
the
market.
and,
of
course,
as
i've
mentioned
before,
this
is
not
an
isolated
phenomenon
by
bancorporation.
all
of
the
holding
companies
in
the
state
of
colorado
are
all
attempting
to
spread
out
and
to
gain
as
many
banks
as
possible.
the
vigor
of
the
--
this
action
by
the
holding
companies
is
not
surprising
because
banking,
unlike
most
other
businesses,
has
very
strict
geographical
limits.
now,
holding
a
bank,
can't
just
expand
around
the
country.
a
bank,
by
definition
under
state
law
can
only
stay
in
the
one
state
and
under
federal
law,
a
holding
company
cannot
acquire
banks
outside
of
the
state
where
its
principal
activity
takes
place.
so
that
bancorporation,
we
think,
is
the
most
likely
entrant.
this
is
the
firm
whose
elimination
as
a
potential
competitor
is
likely
to
have
the
greatest
impact
in
the
market.
we
think
that
this
trend
toward
concentration
is
continuing
in
the
state
and
that
the
--
permitting
bancorporation
to
come
into
this
market
to
eliminate
its
potential
competition
and
to
take
over
the
existing
share
of
the
market,
this
large
share,
approximately
one-third,
that
it
is
now
held
by
the
single
non-holding
company
affiliated
large
bank
is
just
the
kind
of
anti-competitive
probability
that
the
congress
intended
to
bar
in
section
7,
when
it
prohibited
acquisitions
whose
effect,
maybe
--
i
stress
it
may
be
once
again
we're
dealing
with
probabilities,
not
certainties,
whose
effect
may
be
substantially
to
lessen
the
competition.
and
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time
for
rebuttal,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
friedman
yes.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
in
its
many
merger
decisions,
this
court
has
always
relied
on
percentage
figures
on
shares
of
the
market
as
showing
concentration
not
on
questions
as
to
whether
or
not
the
market
could
or
couldn't
absorb
any
more
firms
and
not
on
comparisons
with
what
might
be
the
number
of
entrants
affirms
in
similar
markets.
now,
i
think
the
reason
that
the
percentage
figure
is
as
significant
and
critical
in
determining
concentration
is
because
we
know
that
the
percentage
figures,
the
share
of
the
market
that
a
firm
has
reflects
the
firm's
economic
power
in
the
market.
if
a
firm
has
a
third
of
the
market,
it's
a
powerful
firm
in
the
market
and
therefore
since
the
emphasis
in
section
vii
is
in
on
--
acquisitions
opposed
anticompetitive
threats
and
congress
was
concerned
with
this
rising
trend
in
concentration.
the
way
you
decide
whether
or
not
a
market
is
concentrated,
it
seems
to
us,
is
to
look
and
see
whether
a
small
number
of
firms
have
an
unduly
large
share
of
the
market
because
we
know
that
when
you
have
a
small
number
of
firms
in
a
concentrated
market
as
this
court
has
recognized
what
happens
is,
instead
of
the
usual
competition
with
a
small
number
of
firms,
you
have
an
accommodation
situation.
that,
of
course
is
what
greeley
is,
greeley
more
90%
of
the
deposits
in
the
whole
area
are
concentrated
in
the
hands
of
three
banking
organizations.
now
--
mr.
friedman
well,
that
the
--
the
only
distinction
now
that
i
think
is
a
fair
one,
mr.
chief
justice,
is
the
fact
that
entry
into
the
banking
business
is
restricted.
anybody
can
open
a
shoe
factory
or
a
brewery.
not
anybody
can
go
into
a
banking
market.
and
the
reason,
obviously,
for
that
is
that
there's
some
restriction
on
the
free
play
of
competition
in
banking.
we
can't
have
a
large
group
of
banks
going
after
each
other
competitively
and
result
in
the
weakening
of
banking
structures,
but
it
seems
to
us
there
is
a
corollary
which
points
the
other
way
which
is
the
nature
of
banking,
the
nature
of
banking
because
of
this,
tends
to
be
concentrated.
that
is,
in
most
of
the
smaller
markets
of
the
country,
we
do
have
only
a
small
number
of
banks
and
the
business
tends
to
focus
to
flow
in
to
a
few
of
these
banks,
and
it
seems
to
us
the
fact
that
banking
tends
to
be
concentrated
in
most
of
these
markets
is
all
the
more
reason
to
preserve
whatever
there
may
be
in
the
way
of
possibilities
of
deconcentration
and
of
improving
the
competitive
situation
in
these
markets.
now,
mr.
metzger
has
told
the
court
today
repeatedly
that
the
greeley
market
isn't
very
competitive,
he
says,
and
he
says
that
if
bancorporation
comes
in,
they're
going
to
make
it
more
competitive.
congress,
it
seems
to
us,
has
made
the
decision
that
if
a
market
is
not
competitive,
the
way
to
improve
it,
the
way
to
enhance
competition
is
not
to
permit
a
potential
competitor
to
come
in
and
just
take
it
over.
that
--
that
makes
no
change,
no
change
at
all
in
the
basic
structure
of
the
market.
what
happens
to
the
contrary
is
that
another
one
of
these
large
statewide
organizations
comes
in.
instead
of
having
what
you
previously
had,
which
is
two
of
the
principal
banking
organizations
controlled
by
the
holding
companies
and
the
third
independent
one
that
someday
hopefully
might
become
more
vigorous,
management
can
change,
we
now
have
the
three
of
them
in
there.
mr.
friedman
not
--
not
--
mr.
friedman
i
don't
--
i
don't
--
it
may
improve
in
the
--
in
that
sense,
but
i
--
i
think
it
doesn't
in
the
long
run
improve
the
competitive
situation
because
what
you
have
--
what
you
have,
when
it's
all
over,
is
the
same
basic
market
structure
three
large
firms
and
what
you
have
lost,
what
you
have
lost
in
this
process
is
the
fact
that
you
have
a
fourth
large
firm
standing
outside
the
market
which
is
a
pro-competitive
effect.
mr.
friedman
i
think
--
i
don't
say
it's
a
declining
--
had
it's
share
of
the
market
has
declined
but
during
this
entire
period,
it
has
still
been
virtually
as
large
or
as
--
as
any
bank
in
the
market.
it's
been
a
profitable
bank.
it
is
--
we've
had
this
in
greeley,
as
it's
true
in
most
cities,
development
of
suburbs
and
since
a
bank
under
colorado
law
is
permitted
only
to
have
one
office,
inevitably,
it
may
not
share
quite
as
much
in
the
deposits
in
the
suburban
areas
as
the
downtown
bank.
but
it
seems
to
us
if
competition
--
if
competition
is
to
be
injected
into
this
market
area,
if
competition
is
to
be
injected
into
this
market
area,
the
congressional
determination
in
section
vii
is
not
that,
it's
to
be
done
by
having
a
large
firm
take
over
one
of
the
big
existing
firms
but
to
preserve
whatever
there
may
be
in
the
whole
structure
of
the
market,
that
pose
pro-competitive
possibilities.
that
is,
someone
on
the
outside
waiting.
that
--
that's
the
whole
theory.
that's
the
whole
theory
of
potential
competition,
the
doctrine
of
the
government
is
urging
before
this
court
and
this
--
mr.
metzger
referred
to
these
six
standards
that
this
court
announced
in
brown
shoe
and
suggested
we
didn't
need
any
of
them.
but
of
course,
brown
shoe
was
a
case
involving
elimination
of
direct
competition.
it
was
vertical
--
and
a
vertical
foreclosure
of
competition,
horizontal
combination
of
--
horizontal
merger
between
competitors
and
it
was
in
that
context
that
the
court
announced
these
--
these
factors.
now,
these
factors
seem
to
us,
are
not
the
factors
to
decide
in
a
potential
competition
case.
now,
i'd
just
like
to
refer
to
one
other
thing
that
mr.
metzger
said.
mr.
metzger
said
that
there
is
no
evidence
in
this
record
at
all
that
the
presence
of
bancorporation
outside
had
any
effect,
whatsoever,
on
competition
in
greeley
market.
that
statement
is
based
on
a
question
that
was
put
to
each
of
the
three
presidents
of
the
leading
banks
in
the
city
of
greeley
and
the
question
is
shown
at
page
301,
303
and
305.
it
is
virtually
identical
in
all
cases.
let
me
just
read
the
question
as
frankly
as
put,
had
you
had
a
decision
to
grant
or
deny
credit
to
set
a
given
rate
of
interest
to
charge
or
to
pay
ever
been
affected
by
the
prospect
that
you
might
thereby
induce
first
national
bancorporation
to
apply
for
and
secure
a
charter
to
operate
a
bank
in
greeley.
and
the
answer
to
each
of
these
questions
was
no.
now,
we
don't
suggest
that
when
a
particular
customer
came
in
to
make
a
loan,
and
the
question
was,
"should
i
give
him
the
loan?
what
interest
rate
should
i
charge?
what
the
terms
of
the
loan
should
be”,
that
any
of
the
bank
has
said
to
himself,
“well
now,
if
i
don't
give
him
this
loan
or
if
i
charge
him
an
eighth
of
a
percent
more,
that
means
that
bancorporation
is
going
to
try
to
charter
a
bank
in
greeley”.
what
we
do
say
is,
that
the
whole
market
situation,
the
presence
of
this
important
firm
on
the
outside,
was
a
fact
that
it
influenced
the
general
competitive
practices
in
the
greeley
market.
that
we
think
is
the
role
of
potential
competition.
the
fact
that
this
outside
firm
could
come
in
and
could
shake
the
market
up
is
bound
to
have
some
effect
upon
the
firms
in
the
market.
and,
of
course,
as
long
it's
out
there,
it
has
this
effect
and
if
it
comes
in
through
either
the
foothold
acquisition
or
through
signing
a
small
new
bank,
then
for
the
first
time,
you
do
have
a
real,
strong,
vigorous
competitor
in
this
hitherto
static
market.
thank
you.
mr.
friedman
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
a
direct
appeal
from
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
district
of
colorado
which
at
trial
dismissed
a
government
antitrust
suit,
challenging
a
bank
merger
is
violating
section
7
of
the
clayton
act.
the
merger
involved
the
acquisition
by
the
first
bancorporation
of
colorado,
the
second
largest
bank
holding
company
in
colorado
of
the
first
national
bank
of
greeley
which
is
the
second
largest
bank
in
the
city
of
greeley.
the
holding
company
which
i
shall
refer
to
as
bancorporation,
does
not,
through
any
of
its
subsidiaries,
operate
in
the
city
of
greeley.
so,
this
means
that
the
acquiring
firm
and
the
acquired
firm
are
not
themselves
direct
competitors.
the
theory
of
the
government's
case,
was
that
the
bancorporation
was
a
potential
entrant
into
the
greeley
market
and
that
by
acquiring
the
bank
in
greeley,
the
effect
was
to
remove
the
competitive
effect,
that
the
presence
of
this
potential
entrant
had
on
the
outside
of
the
market
on
the
theory
that
had
it
not
been
for
the
acquisition,
there
was
a
reasonable
probability
that
this
acquiring
firm,
the
holding
company,
would
either
itself
have
entered
the
market
for
acquiring
a
small
bank
or
from
opening
a
new
bank
in
the
greeley
area.
mr.
friedman
no,
no,
of
course
not,
of
course,
not
mr.
chief
justice.
the
--
first
of
all,
our
argument
is
that,
in
view
of
all
the
circumstances
shown
here,
under
the
proper
standard,
in
fact,
this
corporation
was
a
potential
entrant
at
the
time
it
made
the
acquisition.
we
do
not
say
that
the
mere
fact
that
made
the
acquisition
made
it
a
potential
entrant.
what
we
do
say
is,
that
in
this
kind
of
a
situation,
where
the
firm,
as
i
shall
develop,
was
interested
in
the
market,
whereas
an
attractive
market,
where
as
the
record
shows,
they
were
interested
in
going
into
all
the
markets
and
where
it
was
an
attractive
thing
to
prudent
management
that
is
enough
to
make
it,
we
think,
a
potential
entrant,
and
then
the
next
question,
of
course,
is
whether
the
elimination
of
that
potential
entrant
may
have
the
effect
substantially,
to
lessen
competition
in
violation
of
section
7.
mr.
friedman
that's
correct
mr.
justice.
there
are
claimants
that
they
were
a
potential
entrant
here
in
both
ways.
mr.
friedman
oh,
yes.
mr.
friedman
well,
let
me
explain
it
right
now.
mr.
friedman
no
--
well,
i
think
this
court
does
not
say
so,
but
the
concept
is
a
very
simple,
one
which
is,
if
you
have
concentrated
market,
where
two
or
three
firms
own
a
major
share
of
the
--
have
a
major
share
of
the
business
as
it's
true
in
greeley,
if
an
outside
firm
comes
in
and
merely
succeeds
to
the
share
of
the
market
held
by
one
of
these
large
firms,
this
merely
solidifies
the
existing
relationship.
it
tends
to
--
to
tie
up
the
existing
structure.
on
the
other
hand,
if
a
large
firm
comes
into
the
market
by
acquiring
a
smaller
firm
in
the
market,
this
means
that
the
only
way
of
the
large
firm
can
hope
to
achieve
a
substantial
share
of
the
market
is
by
engaging
in
very
vigorous
competition.
and
it
also,
it
seems
to
me
self-evident
that
a
very
large
firm
is
not
going
to
acquire
a
small
firm
in
the
market
unless
it
believes
and
hopes
that
it
can
build
it
up,
and
these
are
--
the
theory
of
it
that
this
kind
of
an
entry
will
inject
into
the
market
a
new
competitive
force
which
is
not
present
in
the
usual
concentrated
market.
mr.
friedman
that
i
--
we
--
we
--
i
don't
know
mr.
justice.
both
of
them,
we
think,
both
of
them
we
think
are
desirable
in
changing
the
structure
of
concentrated
markets,
in
a
sense
--
in
a
sense,
perhaps,
the
acquisition
of
a
small
little
firm
in
the
market
which
up
to
this
time
by
definition
has
not
been
a
very
effective
competitor,
that's
almost
the
equivalent
of
going
in
by
yourself
because
you
start
with
a
little
one
that
says,
though,
you
just
started
it
and
try
to
build
it
up,
and
get
a
larger
share
of
the
market
and
compete
vigorously
in
this
market.
mr.
friedman
no,
no,
i
think
it's
merely
developed
by
the
--
mr.
friedman
--
by
the
government,
mr.
justice.
and
the
--
unfortunately,
i
had
to
say
it
is
not
thus
far,
been
persuasive
to
the
district
courts
that
we
consider
it
but
we
hope
it
will
be
to
this
court.
mr.
friedman
it's
basically
a
factual
one
mr.
justice,
but
we
think
in
resolving
that
question,
judge
doyle,
we
think,
applied
the
wrong
standards
for
determining,
what
is
a
potential
entrant.
that
--
that
is,
we
think
the
judge
applied
what
we
call
the
subjective
standard,
the
standard
based
on
the
express
intent
of
the
corporate
official,
as
the
official
as
to
what
they
would
do,
and
we
don't
think
that
is
the
proper
standard
as
i
shall
develop
in
the
light
of
the
congressional
purposes
in
such
so.
mr.
friedman
he
--
he
spoke
of
objective
evidence,
but
i
--
i
think
mr.
justice,
once
again,
what
he
meant
by
objective
evidence
was
largely
the
--
the
testimony
plus
the
fact
that
he
was
impressed,
i
think,
by
what
he
felt
was
the
unlikelihood
in
terms
of
the
management-stated
prior
program
and
of
plans
of
their
going
in.
he
--
he
did
not,
it
seems,
to
us,
address
himself
to
the
standards
that
we
think
are
the
controlling
of
this.
now,
i
would
like
just
by
a
way
of
background,
give
a
little
bit
of
the
history
of
the
bank
merger
movement
in
this
country.
in
the
late,
in
the
year,
we
--
in
late
1950s,
we
had
a
tremendous
way
of
back
mergers
in
the
major
cities
of
this
country.
competing
banks
joined.
they
formed
these
huge
banks
and
manufactures,
hand
over
morgan
guaranty
in
new
york
and
this
merger
went
on
for
awhile
and
finally
the
government
began
to
bring
suits
against
these
mergers.
and
when
this
court
in
1963
decided
in
the
philadelphia
bank
case,
that
section
7
of
the
clayton
act
applied
to
bank
mergers,
that
basically
marked
the
end
of
this
aspect
of
the
bank
merger
movement
in
this
country,
because
that
case
established
the
two
large
banks
having
a
significant
share
of
the
market
where
competitors
cannot
combine.
mr.
friedman
the
movement
i
discussed
i
think
--
mr.
friedman
--
began
in
the
late
1940s
to
the
early
1950s.
but
the
next
phase
of
this
movement,
which
i
am
coming
to,
i
think
began
in
the
early
1960s.
and
that
was
the
tendency
by
the
large
banks
in
the
big
cities
to
move
into
many
of
the
local
regional
markets,
the
smallest
cities
by
the
acquisition
of
the
most
important
banks
in
those
areas.
that
is
in
states
with
permitted
branch-banking
a
large
bank
would
move
into
a
local
area
by
buying
the
first,
the
second,
the
third,
largest
bank
in
the
city.
in
areas
that
did
not
permit
branch-banking,
the
holding
company
movement
developed
whereby
a
holding
company
was
formed
with
a
large
a
bank
as
its
nucleus
and
this
holding
company
in
turn
proceeded
to
acquire
various
banks
in
the
large
cities.
this
trend
developed
very
rapidly
and
there's
an
exhibit
in
the
record,
defendants
exhibit
30,
at
page
1662,
which
is
a
table
showing
as
of
the
end
1969,
the
percentages
of
the
total
state
bank
deposits
held
by
the
three
largest
and
the
five
largest
banks.
and
this
shows
that
in
17
states,
one-third
of
the
states
by
1969,
17
--
i'm
sorry,
the
three
largest
banking
organizations
in
the
state
had
more
than
50%
of
the
total
deposits.
and
in
24
states,
it
was
the
five
largest
banks
that
had
more
than
that
percentage
of
the
deposits.
now,
this
trend
was
also
present
in
colorado.
in
1960,
there
was
one
holding
company
operating
in
colorado
that
had
three
banks
and
4.4%
of
the
deposits.
by
1970,
there
were
seven
holding
companies
operating
in
colorado.
they
had
41
banks.
and
while
the
41
banks
were
less
than
one-fifth
of
the
total
banks
in
the
state,
they
had
51%
of
the
deposits
in
colorado.
so,
we
see
that
what
has
been
happening
in
colorado
is
what
has
been
happening
throughout
the
rest
of
the
country
in
varying
degree.
the
large
banks
--
the
large
banks
in
the
cities
through
these
holding
companies
have
been
going
out
and
acquiring
major
competitors
in
the
local
markets.
now,
the
greeley
area
itself,
has
felt
this
trend.
there
are
eight
banking
organizations
in
greeley,
prior
to
this
acquisition.
four
of
them
were
owned
by
two
colorado
holding
companies
and
they
had
60%
of
the
deposits
in
the
greeley
area.
and
it's
against
this
background,
this
history,
of
a
merger
movement
in
the
banking
field
that
the
acquisition
by
more
and
more
of
the
local
banking
leaders
throughout
the
state,
that
the
effect
of
this
merger
in
the
greeley
area
must
be
--
get
based.
now
denver
is
the
commercial
and
banking
center
of
colorado,
but
in
addition
to
this,
there
were
six
other
important
banking
centers,
smaller
cities
in
colorado
of
which
greeley
is
one.
the
holding
company
was
formed
in
1968
by
the
officials
of
the
principal
bank
in
the
system,
the
first
national
bank
which
is
the
second
largest
bank
in
the
city
of
--
i'm
sorry,
it's
above
myself
--
is
the
largest
bank
in
the
city
of
denver.
it's
a
bank
with
assets
of
approximately
$500
million.
it
also
has
three
smaller
banks
in
the
denver
suburbs
which
were
organized
by
the
people
who
were
the
principals
of
the
first
national
bank
of
denver
prior
to
the
time
the
holding
company
was
formed.
and
in
his
deposition,
the
president
of
the
holding
company
testified
that
one
reason
his
people
formed
this
holding
company
was
because
of
the
trend
in
colorado
of
other
bank
holding
companies
acquiring
banks.
that's
shown
at
page
535
of
the
record.
now,
in
its
first
annual
report
to
its
stockholders,
the
--
the
holding
company
explained
what
its
purpose
was,
what
it
was
going
to
do.
it
said
and
this
is
at
page
513
of
the
record.
he
said,
“the
policy
of
our
company
is
to
expand
as
rapidly
and
as
wisely
as
possible,
through
the
acquisition
of
other
banks
in
colorado
and
it's
a
(inaudible)
banks
which
held
out
of
good
potential
for
growth
and
through
other
legally
permissible
investments
and
activities.”
now,
this
thought
was
repeated
in
a
deposition,
again,
given
by
the
president
of
the
holding
company
which
he
said
at
pages
535
to
536
of
the
record,
“we
would
like
to
have
a
bank
in
the
major
cities
of
colorado.”
they
want
--
they
wanted
a
bank
in
major
cities
of
colorado
and
he
also
listed
various
other
areas
where
they
would
like
to
be.
and
then
he
was
asked
whether
in
their
plans
the
holding
company
had
ruled
out
the
possibility
of
de
novo
expansion,
because
the
report,
they
spoke
about
acquiring
other
banks
and
he
said,
“no,
we
haven't
ruled
out
that
possibility.”
the
first
step
in
this
program
of
expanding
into
the
various
local
areas
was
the
acquisition
in
greeley.
that
was
the
first
one.
since
that
time,
bancorporation
has
attempted
to
acquire
five
other
banks
in
various
areas
of
colorado.
two
of
the
proposed
acquisitions
were
the
largest
banks
in
the
particular
areas.
two
others
were
of
the
second
largest
banks.
they've
not
been
successful
in
this
in
endeavor,
and
one
of
them,
they
were
able
to
accomplish.
at
two
instances,
the
regulatory
authorities
turned
them
down.
in
one
instance,
the
acquisition
was
approved,
but
was
abandoned
when
the
government
filed
a
suit,
and
the
last
one,
we
still
have
a
suit
against
it
pending.
but
to
us,
the
significant
setting
is
to
show
that
the
first
bancorporation
was
not
just
sitting
idly
by
with
its
three
or
four
banks
and
waiting.
it
was
going
out
trying
to
acquire
other
banks
in
the
area.
now,
the
city
of
greeley
is
15
miles,
approximately
north
of
denver.
the
city
has
a
population
of
38,000.
the
greeley
area
which
has
certain
surrounding
communities
which
the
district
court
held
here
to
be
the
relevant
market
has
a
population
of
58,000.
it
has
mainly
been
an
agricultural
community,
but
in
the
last
decade,
industry
has
come
up
in
substantial
measure.
the
areas
had
a
good,
steady
growth
as
we
set
out
in
our
brief
at
page
9,
to
give
some
statistics.
and
this
is
an
area
that
is
attractive
to
bancorporation.
now,
our
opponent
suggests
that
there
was
no
particular
reason
why
this
company
should
have
gone
into
greeley,
that
there
are
more
attractive
markets
involved.
but
i
would
like
to
read
to
the
court
two
quotations.
unfortunately,
we
did
not
cite
this
in
our
brief
from
page
555.
and
this
is
the
man
named
“adams”
who
is
the
present
of
the
first
national
bank
of
denver
and
a
previous
president
of
the
bancorporation,
and
he
was
asked
on
this
deposition
why
the
bank
was
interested
in
acquiring
the
bank
in
greeley,
and
what
he
said
was
in
the
middle
of
the
page,
“we
were
very
anxious
as
i
say
to
get
into
the
greeley
area,
because
it
is
one
of
the
best
towns
in
northern
colorado
and
has
been
for
many,
many,
many
years
a
great
agricultural
area
and
a
fine
area.
and
we
would
very
much
like
to
have
a
unit
up
there
in
greeley.”
that
at
the
bottom
of
the
page
he
repeated
this
quote,
when
he
said,
“it
is
one
of
the
growth
areas
of
colorado
and
we'd
like
to
be
in
it.”
now,
the
greeley
market,
as
i
indicated
before,
is
a
concentrated
market.
the
three
principle
banking
organizations
have
92%
of
the
deposits.
the
acquired
bank,
first
national
of
greeley
is
approximately
the
same
size
as
the
larger
bank
within
a
--
a
10th
of
1%,
percentage
wise,
roughly,
32%
of
the
market.
and
the
first
national
bank
is
the
only
bank
in
the
area,
the
only
largest
bank
in
the
area
that
is
not
owned
by
a
holding
company.
now,
the
district
court
in
deciding
this
case
stated
that
the
issue
was
whether
if
there
would
be
--
there
would
be,
not
there
may
be,
he
said,
“whether
there
would
be
a
substantial
lessening
of
competition”.
and
the
court
concluded
that
the
government
had
to
show
that
the
acquisition
in
question
has
the
effect,
substantially,
to
lessen
competition.
now,
the
court
agreed
with
the
government
that
commercial
banking
is
the
relevant
product
market
and
found,
although,
the
government
had
suggested
two
alternatives,
found
that
the
greeley
area
was
the
relevant
geographical
market.
the
district
court
also
recognized
that
the
elimination
of
a
potential
competitor
may
have
the
effect
of
substantially
lessening
competition
in
violation
of
section
7.
the
court
said,
“where
the
concentration
is
high,
the
merger
removes
the
potential
competitor
as
a
restraining
influence
and
the
anticompetitive
effects
can
be
significant.”
the
court
went
it
on
--
and
they
hold
however,
that
this
merger
did
not
eliminate
a
substantial
competitor,
sorry,
a
substantial
entrant.
since
the
court
said
that
the
evidence
was
uncontradicted
that
bancorporation
has
no
intention
of
entering
the
greeley
market
if
this
acquisition
is
disapproved.
and
we
think
primarily
that
the
district
court
relied
on
two
bits
of
evidence.
one
was
the
testimony
of
an
official
of
bancorporation
that
they
would
not
enter
the
market.
and
secondly,
the
testimony
of
state
regulatory
officials
which
the
district
court
interpreted
as
indicating,
they
would
not
charter
a
new
bank
in
the
greeley
area.
the
court
did
not
reach
because
of
its
disposition
that
the
government
had
not
shown
anticompetitive
effect.
the
second
issue
under
the
bank
holding
company
act
is
the
same
as
under
the
bank
merger
act
whether
any
anticompetitive
effect
of
the
acquisition
are
clearly
outweighed
by
the
effect
of
the
merger
in
serving
the
convenience
and
needs
of
the
community.
so,
that
issue
has
not
been
resolved
and
if
the
court
agrees
with
us
that
the
wrong
standards
were
applied
then
the
case
has
to
be
remanded,
that
is
an
issue
for
the
district
court
to
deal
with
on
remand.
the
court
also
rejected
an
alternative
ground
on
which
the
government
challenged
the
merger.
that
is,
that
the
effect
of
this
merger
was
to
foreclose
to
competing
large
banks
in
colorado,
so-called
correspondent
banking.
that
is
the
practice
by
which
the
large
city
banks
perform
various
cervices
for
the
country
banks,
such
as
clearing
checks,
making
loans
in
excess
of
the
local
banks,
when
it's
giving
them
investment
advice,
serving
as
a
depository
for
various
funds.
and
the
government
claims
that
by
preempting
the
correspondent
banking
business
of
first,
of
greeley,
the
effect
of
the
merger
was
to
foreclose
to
the
other
banks
in
colorado
a
significant
important
share
of
this
business
and
that
in
the
light
of
the
trend
toward
concentration
in
the
colorado
banking
field,
this
also
had
an
anticompetitive
effect.
this
argument
is
a
rather
detailed
and
technical
one.
it
turns
on
questions
of
defining
the
market
on
disputes
as
to
the
irrelevant
statistics
involved.
it's
not
particularly
appropriate
for
oral
argument
and
i
propose
to
leave
that
discussion
to
the
brief.
now,
as
i
indicated,
the
district
court
didn't
question
that
the
elimination
of
potential
competition
may
substantially
lessen
the
competition.
and
this
court
has
repeatedly
so
indicated.
and
as
i've
also
indicated,
we
think
the
primary
issue
in
this
case,
therefore,
is
the
standard
for
determining
whether
a
firm
is
a
potential
entrant.
the
1950
amendments,
the
(inaudible)
act,
to
section
of
7
of
the
clayton
act,
reflected
the
rising
concern
--
i'm
sorry,
the
concern
of
congress
over
the
rising
trend
of
concentration
in
american
industry
and
congress
was
concerned
that
this
trend
or
concentration
would
result
in
a
further
weakening
of
a
normal
--
forces
of
competition
in
the
marketplace.
and
accordingly,
congress
strengthened
the
prohibitions
of
the
clayton
act
against
mergers
which
may
have
an
anticompetitive
effect.
the
purpose
of
section
7
as
amended
was
to
maintain
the
structure
of
the
market.
unlike
such
in
one
of
the
sherman
act
which
is
directed
to
conduct
in
the
market
anticompetitive
acts,
we
think
section
7
is
designed
to
preserve
the
structure,
to
avoid
changes
in
the
organization
of
the
market
that
pose
a
serious
danger
of
anticompetitive
effects
as
it's
repeatedly
been
stated
in
section
7.
in
1950,
congress
was
concerned
with
--
not
with
certainties
but
with
probabilities.
it
was
designed
to
stop
these
things
in
their
incipiency.
now,
in
a
market
where
you
have
many
sellers,
a
large
number
of
sellers,
none
of
whom
has
any
significant
major
share
of
the
market,
normally,
we
know
that
competition
plays
the
role
of
regulating
the
market.
but
when
you
get
into
these
concentrative
markets,
where
a
small
number
of
sellers
have
the
major
share
of
the
market
and
each
one
has
a
very
large
share,
economic
theory
teaches
that
in
that
situation,
what's
likely
to
develop
is
not
the
normal
competition
but
parallel
policies,
easy
accommodation.
and
therefore,
traditionally
markets
that
have
a
small
number
of
firms
with
a
large
share
are
not
characterized
by
the
kind
of
vigorous
competition
normally
found
in
traditional
markets.
and
that
principle,
that
concentration
is
inimicable
to
the
free
play
of
competitive
forces
is
also
applicable
to
banking.
as
this
court
stated
in
the
philadelphia
bank
case,
there
is
no
reason
to
think
that
concentration
is
less
inimicable
to
the
free
play
of
competition
in
banking
than
in
any
other
services.
now,
as
i
have
indicated,
the
potential
entrants
standing
on
the
outside
of
a
concentrated
market
has
two
roles
to
play,
two
roles
in
preserving
the
competitive
structure
of
the
market.
first
of
all,
standing
outside
the
market
inevitably
plays
an
influence
on
the
people
inside
the
market.
that
is
the
firms
inside
the
market
who
have
this
great
economic
power
are
well
aware
that
if
they
abused
it,
if
they
get
too
greedy
in
their
practices,
there's
always
the
danger
of
this
strong
firm
coming
in
and
taking
away
from
the
firms
that
hold
a
major
share
of
the
market,
a
section
of
that
market.
and
indeed
this
court
and
its
penn-olin
opinion
at
378
u.s.
at
page
174,
quoted
with
approval
from
a
t.n.e.c.
monograph
written
30
years
ago
which
directly
reflected
that
principle
and
it's
also
reflected
in
the
testimony
of
our
economic
expert,
professor
welch.
mr.
friedman
that
is
correct,
fairly
recently.
mr.
friedman
no,
i
--
no
i
would
not.
that,
in
fact
--
that's
one
of
our
major
contentions
is,
that
we
think
that
bancorporation
instead
of
acquiring
this
large
firm,
this
is
one
of,
we
think,
one
of
the
proper
ways
for
a
large
firm
to
get
into
a
concentrated
market.
this
firm
has
been
charted
by
a
small
holding
company,
a
small
holding
company
in
colorado.
the
claim
is
that
bancorporation
couldn't
have
gotten
a
charter.
that's
one
of
the
claims.
they
rely
--
they
say
that
the
testimony
by
the
state
banking
commission
indicates
that
because
charters
had
been
turned
down
in
other
localities,
there
was
no
chance
that
a
charter
would
have
been
granted
for
another
bank
greeley.
less
than
a
year
later,
lo
and
behold,
someone
did
come
in
and
seek
a
charter
for
new
bank
in
greeley
and
it
was
granted.
and
there's
no
reason
to
think
that
if
bancorporation
instead
of
seeking
to
make
this
acquisition
had
itself
going
in,
looked
for
an
application
for
new
a
charter
that
it
wouldn't
have
been
granted,
too.
mr.
friedman
no
--
no
we
don't
--
we
don't
contend
it's
under
bank,
mr.
justice.
what
we
do
contend
is
that
greeley
was
a
growing
area
where
there's
room
for
additional
banks,
and
that
the
creation
of
new
competition
in
greeley
would
tend
to
shake
up
this
market
which
had
been
relatively
static
before
then.
now,
the
other
role
of
a
potential
competitor
play
one
role
--
the
potential
competitor
sits
on
the
outside
and
in
effect
inhibits
anticompetitive
behavior
by
the
large
firms
in
the
market.
the
other
role,
equally
significant,
is
if
the
potential
competitor
enters
the
market.
if
a
potential
competitor
enters
the
market,
either
by
acquiring
a
small
bank
or
by
itself
organizing
the
bank,
this
again
tends
to
inject
into
what
has
been
basically
and
not
very
competitive
off
the
market,
a
new
competition.
now,
of
course,
as
long
as
the
potential
competitor
remains
outside,
it
has
these
salutary
purposes.
but
once
it
enters
by
acquiring
a
market
leader,
two
things
happen.
whatever
effect
it
has
staying
on
the
outside
disappears
and
the
possibility
of
any
vigorous
and
new
competition
by
creation
of
a
new
competitor
disappears.
all
at
you
have
in
this
type
of
a
situation
is
that
the
outside
powerful
firm
comes
in
and
takes
over
the
market
share
of
one
of
the
major
banks
in
the
area.
now,
the
significance
that
an
outside
potential
entrant
has
on
competition
in
the
market,
basically
depends
on
the
relationship
between
this
bank
and
the
structure
of
the
market,
that
is,
what
kind
of
a
market
is
it,
what
is
its
role
on
the
outside,
is
it
a
concentrated
market
of
the
facts
such
as
to
indicate
that
the
bank
is
likely
to
come
in.
and
that
of
course
it
seems
to
me
is
the
kind
of
a
question
that
has
to
be
determined
on
the
basis
of
the
objective
evidence
in
the
case,
not
on
the
basis
of
the
intent
of
the
parties
--
the
stated
intent
of
the
firm.
it
seems
to
us
that
this
is
just
not
the
way
in
which
this
kind
of
a
determination
should
be
made.
mr.
friedman
i
would
not
go
so
far
as
to
say
that
cannot
consider
it
but
certainly
the
court
can't
base
it
on
that
fact
and
i
think
it's
entitled
to
very
little
weight.
and
let
me
--
if
i
may
explain
particularly
with
reference
to
this
kind
of
testimony,
the
question
basically.
it
is
--
is
asked
in
this
case,
as
is,
had
you
not
been
permitted
to
make
the
acquisition,
would
you
have
gone
in
either
through
making
a
small
acquisition
or
by
organizing
your
own
bank.
and
almost
invariably,
as
is
true
in
this
case,
the
answer
is
no,
we
would
not.
now,
this
is
a
question
put
to
a
witness
after
the
witness
has
already
made
the
decision
to
go
in
by
the
acquisition
route.
and
it
--
it's
just,
almost,
psychologically
impossible
for
someone
to
give
an
objective
valuation
as
to
what
he
would
have
done,
had
there
not
been
this
situation.
mr.
friedman
no,
but
we're
not
--
we're
--
what
i
was
suggesting
mr.
justice,
is
that
is
just
not
a
very
reliable
basis
upon
which
to
make
the
kind
of
a
judgment
involved
in
this
area
because
it
--
it's
subject
to
--
to
many
problems.
mr.
friedman
now,
well,
i
think
the
strongest
--
the
strongest
evidence
of
his
intention
to
go
unless
it'd
say
--
mr.
friedman
well,
but
--
but
i
--
i
think
it's
a
---
it's
a
different
situation,
mr.
justice,
it's
a
very
different
situation.
mr.
friedman
perhaps.
i
--
i
think
the
difference
is
this,
mr.
justice.
in
the
one
case
--
in
the
one
case,
he's
being
asked
in
effect
a
hypothetical
question,
what
he
--
what
they
would
have
done,
had
they
not
done
what
they
decided
to
do.
and
this
seems
to
me
gets
–-
mr.
friedman
i
don't
say
that
he'd
wholly
disregard,
but
i
--
i
think
it's
something
that
cannot
be
dispositive
or
given
great
way.
mr.
friedman
i'm
sure
i
would.
mr.
friedman
well,
it's
whether
it's
--
the
test
--
let
me
make,
if
i
may
suggest,
in
there
and
hypothetically
you
oppose
to
finding
the
document
that
support
our
case,
i
think
we
would
say
that
just
confirms
what
the
other
evidence
shows.
mr.
friedman
well,
it
is.
it's
--
it's
obviously
of
subsequence.
let
me
explain
another
thing
here,
another
reason
why
we
think
this
kind
of
intent
testimony
is
not,
preferably
persuasive.
one
of
the
effects,
one
of
the
substantial
impacts
that
the
presence
of
an
outside
competitor
has
is
on
the
conduct
of
the
people
in
the
market.
the
knowledge
of
this
and
the
outside
competitor
on
the
(inaudible)
and
the
people
who
are
in
the
market
have
to
make
their
judgment,
have
to
influence
their
practices
on
the
basis
of
what
they
judge
from
the
objective
evidence.
that
is,
they
look
and
see
what
kind
of
a
firm
in
this,
what
is
happening
in
the
market,
whether
it
has
the
capacity
to
come
in,
whether
it
looks
like
the
kind
of
an
opportunity
--
would
be
attractive
for
them.
they
don't
know.
they
don't
know
and
can't
make
their
business
judgments
on
the
basis
of
what
may
be
in
the
minds
of
the
officials
of
the
outside
company.
now,
i
think
one
other
bit
of
evidence
that
is
quite
significant
in
deciding
how
you
evaluate
these
claims
that
they
wouldn't
go
in,
otherwise,
is
what
has
actually
happened
in
colorado
and
in
other
states
where
bank
holding
companies
have
sought
and
been
denied
permission
to
the
enter
the
markets,
to
acquiring
a
large
share.
and
when
that
was
turned
down
and
that
failed
they
would
then
go
in
and
try
to
acquire
a
smaller
bank.
a
very
interesting
example
is
this
very
holding
company,
bancorporation.
and
in
addition,
united
banks
of
colorado,
the
largest
holding
company
in
this
state,
each
of
them
tried
to
acquire
one
of
the
leading
banks
in
a
large
community,
failed.
and
then
preceeded
to
try
to
acquire
and
succeeded
a
much
smaller
bank.
bancorporation
tried
to
acquire
the
leading
bank
in
colorado
springs.
and
it's
--
i
--
i'm
sorry,
the
second
largest
bank
in
colorado
springs,
and
when
it,
in
its
application
to
the
federal
reserve
board,
it
said
it
would
be
imprudent
for
it.
imprudent
was
the
word
they'd
used,
to
try
to
get
into
the
market
either
by
acquiring
a
smaller
bank
or
by
opening
its
own
bank.
the
fed
approved
that,
but
the
merger
was
abandoned
when
the
government
filed
an
antitrust
suit.
bancorporation
then
turned
around
and
applied
for
and
got
permission,
to
acquire
a
bank
in
colorado
springs
that
was
one-seventh
the
size
of
the
bank
they
originally
had
sought.
mr.
friedman
i
don't
believe
it
--
i
don't
believe
that
evidence
was,
but
it
seems
to
us
--
mr.
friedman
well,
it's
all
the
matter
of
public
record
mr.
justice.
these
are
reports
of
government
regulatory
authorities
deciding
these
cases.
mr.
friedman
normally
so,
mr.
justice,
but
i'm
just
suggesting
that
this
subsequent
evidence
confirms
our
claim
that
the
kind
of
evidence
that
the
district
court
relied
on
in
this
case,
is
not
a
reliable
basis
for
deciding
these
questions.
one
last
point
i
would
make
is
the
testimony
of
the
regulatory
officials,
of
the
court
relied
on.
again,
this
is
a
wholly
conjectural
type
of
evidence.
he's
asked
whether
he
would
or
wouldn't
charter
a
new
bank,
and
he
said,
he
had
recommended
he
would
charter
a
new
bank
within
five
years.
well,
regulatory
officials
decide
questions
of
whether
they
charter
a
new
bank
on
the
basis
on
an
application
to
that
is
filed
to
them.
they
consider
all
the
facts.
they
have
also
sorts
of
detailed
specifications.
all
he
said
was
that
he
wouldn't
recommend
to
his
superior
the
controller
of
the
currency.
it's
the
controller
of
the
currency
who
makes
the
decision.
conditions
change.
perhaps,
he
would
not
have
recommended
the
chartering
of
a
new
bank
in
greeley
at
the
time
of
the
trial.
in
two
years
he
might
have
used
regulatory
officials
also
(inaudible)
mr.
friedman
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i'd
like
to
turn
out
one
other
important
aspect
of
this
case
and
that
is
the
reason
why
we
think
that
bancorporation's
elimination
was
a
potential,
and
it
was
particularly
significant
because
bancorporation,
we
believe,
was
one
of
the
few
firms
in
the
state
of
colorado
that
was
likely
to
be
an
important
and
significant
competitor.
our
opponents
tell
us
that
bancorporation
was
insignificant
as
a
potential
and
i
think
they
say,
“anybody
can
organize
a
bank.”
they
say,
“it's
not
very
difficult,
a
few
people
get
together,
get
together
a
little
capital
and
organize
a
bank.”
that's
quite
true,
of
course,
but
it's
only,
we
think,
a
large
bank,
a
bank
with
the
resources,
that
bancorporation
has
that
does
hold
out
a
real
potential
for
shaking
up
this
market.
now,
there
are,
at
the
present
time,
in
the
state
of
colorado
that
work
upon
this
acquisition,
seven
holding
companies.
two
of
them
are
already
operating
in
the
greeley
market.
the
third
one,
a
very
large
holding
company
called
western
bancorporation,
a
multibillion-dollar
concern
under
federal
law
is
precluded
from
having
anymore
banks
in
colorado,
so
that
takes
care
of
three.
one
of
these
other
holding
companies
is
quite
small.
it's
no
larger,
basically,
than
the
bank
to
be
acquired,
that's
four.
now
the
remaining
three
in
the
state
of
colorado,
bancorporation
is
by
far
the
largest.
in
fact,
it's
about
twice
as
large
as
the
other
two.
so
that
it
seems
to
us
that
viewing
this
whole
situation
in
colorado
that
bancorporation
is
now
the
leading
holding
company,
the
biggest
holding
company
that
is
not
in
the
market
and
is
a
firm
that
has
indicated
its
intention
of
going
into
the
market.
and,
of
course,
as
i've
mentioned
before,
this
is
not
an
isolated
phenomenon
by
bancorporation.
all
of
the
holding
companies
in
the
state
of
colorado
are
all
attempting
to
spread
out
and
to
gain
as
many
banks
as
possible.
the
vigor
of
the
--
this
action
by
the
holding
companies
is
not
surprising
because
banking,
unlike
most
other
businesses,
has
very
strict
geographical
limits.
now,
holding
a
bank,
can't
just
expand
around
the
country.
a
bank,
by
definition
under
state
law
can
only
stay
in
the
one
state
and
under
federal
law,
a
holding
company
cannot
acquire
banks
outside
of
the
state
where
its
principal
activity
takes
place.
so
that
bancorporation,
we
think,
is
the
most
likely
entrant.
this
is
the
firm
whose
elimination
as
a
potential
competitor
is
likely
to
have
the
greatest
impact
in
the
market.
we
think
that
this
trend
toward
concentration
is
continuing
in
the
state
and
that
the
--
permitting
bancorporation
to
come
into
this
market
to
eliminate
its
potential
competition
and
to
take
over
the
existing
share
of
the
market,
this
large
share,
approximately
one-third,
that
it
is
now
held
by
the
single
non-holding
company
affiliated
large
bank
is
just
the
kind
of
anti-competitive
probability
that
the
congress
intended
to
bar
in
section
7,
when
it
prohibited
acquisitions
whose
effect,
maybe
--
i
stress
it
may
be
once
again
we're
dealing
with
probabilities,
not
certainties,
whose
effect
may
be
substantially
to
lessen
the
competition.
and
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time
for
rebuttal,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
friedman
yes.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
in
its
many
merger
decisions,
this
court
has
always
relied
on
percentage
figures
on
shares
of
the
market
as
showing
concentration
not
on
questions
as
to
whether
or
not
the
market
could
or
couldn't
absorb
any
more
firms
and
not
on
comparisons
with
what
might
be
the
number
of
entrants
affirms
in
similar
markets.
now,
i
think
the
reason
that
the
percentage
figure
is
as
significant
and
critical
in
determining
concentration
is
because
we
know
that
the
percentage
figures,
the
share
of
the
market
that
a
firm
has
reflects
the
firm's
economic
power
in
the
market.
if
a
firm
has
a
third
of
the
market,
it's
a
powerful
firm
in
the
market
and
therefore
since
the
emphasis
in
section
vii
is
in
on
--
acquisitions
opposed
anticompetitive
threats
and
congress
was
concerned
with
this
rising
trend
in
concentration.
the
way
you
decide
whether
or
not
a
market
is
concentrated,
it
seems
to
us,
is
to
look
and
see
whether
a
small
number
of
firms
have
an
unduly
large
share
of
the
market
because
we
know
that
when
you
have
a
small
number
of
firms
in
a
concentrated
market
as
this
court
has
recognized
what
happens
is,
instead
of
the
usual
competition
with
a
small
number
of
firms,
you
have
an
accommodation
situation.
that,
of
course
is
what
greeley
is,
greeley
more
90%
of
the
deposits
in
the
whole
area
are
concentrated
in
the
hands
of
three
banking
organizations.
now
--
mr.
friedman
well,
that
the
--
the
only
distinction
now
that
i
think
is
a
fair
one,
mr.
chief
justice,
is
the
fact
that
entry
into
the
banking
business
is
restricted.
anybody
can
open
a
shoe
factory
or
a
brewery.
not
anybody
can
go
into
a
banking
market.
and
the
reason,
obviously,
for
that
is
that
there's
some
restriction
on
the
free
play
of
competition
in
banking.
we
can't
have
a
large
group
of
banks
going
after
each
other
competitively
and
result
in
the
weakening
of
banking
structures,
but
it
seems
to
us
there
is
a
corollary
which
points
the
other
way
which
is
the
nature
of
banking,
the
nature
of
banking
because
of
this,
tends
to
be
concentrated.
that
is,
in
most
of
the
smaller
markets
of
the
country,
we
do
have
only
a
small
number
of
banks
and
the
business
tends
to
focus
to
flow
in
to
a
few
of
these
banks,
and
it
seems
to
us
the
fact
that
banking
tends
to
be
concentrated
in
most
of
these
markets
is
all
the
more
reason
to
preserve
whatever
there
may
be
in
the
way
of
possibilities
of
deconcentration
and
of
improving
the
competitive
situation
in
these
markets.
now,
mr.
metzger
has
told
the
court
today
repeatedly
that
the
greeley
market
isn't
very
competitive,
he
says,
and
he
says
that
if
bancorporation
comes
in,
they're
going
to
make
it
more
competitive.
congress,
it
seems
to
us,
has
made
the
decision
that
if
a
market
is
not
competitive,
the
way
to
improve
it,
the
way
to
enhance
competition
is
not
to
permit
a
potential
competitor
to
come
in
and
just
take
it
over.
that
--
that
makes
no
change,
no
change
at
all
in
the
basic
structure
of
the
market.
what
happens
to
the
contrary
is
that
another
one
of
these
large
statewide
organizations
comes
in.
instead
of
having
what
you
previously
had,
which
is
two
of
the
principal
banking
organizations
controlled
by
the
holding
companies
and
the
third
independent
one
that
someday
hopefully
might
become
more
vigorous,
management
can
change,
we
now
have
the
three
of
them
in
there.
mr.
friedman
not
--
not
--
mr.
friedman
i
don't
--
i
don't
--
it
may
improve
in
the
--
in
that
sense,
but
i
--
i
think
it
doesn't
in
the
long
run
improve
the
competitive
situation
because
what
you
have
--
what
you
have,
when
it's
all
over,
is
the
same
basic
market
structure
three
large
firms
and
what
you
have
lost,
what
you
have
lost
in
this
process
is
the
fact
that
you
have
a
fourth
large
firm
standing
outside
the
market
which
is
a
pro-competitive
effect.
mr.
friedman
i
think
--
i
don't
say
it's
a
declining
--
had
it's
share
of
the
market
has
declined
but
during
this
entire
period,
it
has
still
been
virtually
as
large
or
as
--
as
any
bank
in
the
market.
it's
been
a
profitable
bank.
it
is
--
we've
had
this
in
greeley,
as
it's
true
in
most
cities,
development
of
suburbs
and
since
a
bank
under
colorado
law
is
permitted
only
to
have
one
office,
inevitably,
it
may
not
share
quite
as
much
in
the
deposits
in
the
suburban
areas
as
the
downtown
bank.
but
it
seems
to
us
if
competition
--
if
competition
is
to
be
injected
into
this
market
area,
if
competition
is
to
be
injected
into
this
market
area,
the
congressional
determination
in
section
vii
is
not
that,
it's
to
be
done
by
having
a
large
firm
take
over
one
of
the
big
existing
firms
but
to
preserve
whatever
there
may
be
in
the
whole
structure
of
the
market,
that
pose
pro-competitive
possibilities.
that
is,
someone
on
the
outside
waiting.
that
--
that's
the
whole
theory.
that's
the
whole
theory
of
potential
competition,
the
doctrine
of
the
government
is
urging
before
this
court
and
this
--
mr.
metzger
referred
to
these
six
standards
that
this
court
announced
in
brown
shoe
and
suggested
we
didn't
need
any
of
them.
but
of
course,
brown
shoe
was
a
case
involving
elimination
of
direct
competition.
it
was
vertical
--
and
a
vertical
foreclosure
of
competition,
horizontal
combination
of
--
horizontal
merger
between
competitors
and
it
was
in
that
context
that
the
court
announced
these
--
these
factors.
now,
these
factors
seem
to
us,
are
not
the
factors
to
decide
in
a
potential
competition
case.
now,
i'd
just
like
to
refer
to
one
other
thing
that
mr.
metzger
said.
mr.
metzger
said
that
there
is
no
evidence
in
this
record
at
all
that
the
presence
of
bancorporation
outside
had
any
effect,
whatsoever,
on
competition
in
greeley
market.
that
statement
is
based
on
a
question
that
was
put
to
each
of
the
three
presidents
of
the
leading
banks
in
the
city
of
greeley
and
the
question
is
shown
at
page
301,
303
and
305.
it
is
virtually
identical
in
all
cases.
let
me
just
read
the
question
as
frankly
as
put,
had
you
had
a
decision
to
grant
or
deny
credit
to
set
a
given
rate
of
interest
to
charge
or
to
pay
ever
been
affected
by
the
prospect
that
you
might
thereby
induce
first
national
bancorporation
to
apply
for
and
secure
a
charter
to
operate
a
bank
in
greeley.
and
the
answer
to
each
of
these
questions
was
no.
now,
we
don't
suggest
that
when
a
particular
customer
came
in
to
make
a
loan,
and
the
question
was,
"should
i
give
him
the
loan?
what
interest
rate
should
i
charge?
what
the
terms
of
the
loan
should
be”,
that
any
of
the
bank
has
said
to
himself,
“well
now,
if
i
don't
give
him
this
loan
or
if
i
charge
him
an
eighth
of
a
percent
more,
that
means
that
bancorporation
is
going
to
try
to
charter
a
bank
in
greeley”.
what
we
do
say
is,
that
the
whole
market
situation,
the
presence
of
this
important
firm
on
the
outside,
was
a
fact
that
it
influenced
the
general
competitive
practices
in
the
greeley
market.
that
we
think
is
the
role
of
potential
competition.
the
fact
that
this
outside
firm
could
come
in
and
could
shake
the
market
up
is
bound
to
have
some
effect
upon
the
firms
in
the
market.
and,
of
course,
as
long
it's
out
there,
it
has
this
effect
and
if
it
comes
in
through
either
the
foothold
acquisition
or
through
signing
a
small
new
bank,
then
for
the
first
time,
you
do
have
a
real,
strong,
vigorous
competitor
in
this
hitherto
static
market.
thank
you.
