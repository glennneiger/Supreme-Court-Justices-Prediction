mr.
eugene
j.
metzger
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
in
the
statement
of
the
case
yesterday,
mr.
friedman
made
reference
to
certain
matters
outside
the
record
in
this
case
to
the
extent
that
those
matters
are
conceived
to
be
of
any
relevance
by
any
members
of
this
court,
appellees
hastened
to
say
that
we
do
not
accept
the
government's
representations
as
to
what
those
facts
are.
as
an
example
of
one
instance
in
which
we
are
in
disagreement
as
to
those
facts,
we
respectfully
direct
the
court's
attention
to
footnote
57
on
page
44
of
our
brief.
in
answer
to
a
question
from
mr.
justice
blackmun
yesterday,
it
was
suggested
that
the
government
would
not
have
brought
this
case,
had
we
chosen
the
ultimate
means
of
entry
into
the
market
in
question.
we
had
not
understood
it
to
be
the
law
that
a
merger
would
be
precluded
simply
because
there
were
ultimate
means
of
entering
into
a
particular
market
available.
we
hasten
to
say
that
we
do
not
agree
that
there
--
that
we
would,
in
reasonable
probability,
had
entered
this
market
absent
this
particular
affiliation.
however,
we
believe
that
showing
that
we
are
--
we
have
other
methods
of
entering
this
market
is
a
beginning
and
not
an
end
for
the
government's
burden
of
proof
in
these
matters.
what
seems
to
appellees
to
have
been
the
key
passage
from
the
opinion
of
the
court
below
was
a
problem.
we
have
sought
to
apply
the
standards
laid
down
by
the
supreme
court
in
naming
philadelphia
bank
and
philipsburg
bank
two
of
the
banks,
in
an
effort
to
arrive
at
an
accurate
and
fair
decision
herein.
the
main
difficulty
here
is
the
lack
of
cogent
evidence
which
even
suggest
that
there
is
likely
to
be
a
lessening
of
competition
as
a
result
of
this
present
acquisition.
nothing
has
been
presented
which
of
itself
or
considered
with
the
total
circumstances
serves
to
make
any
impact.
this
is
from
329
f.
supp.
at
page
1016.
now,
it
would
seem
then
to
me
that
we
are
dealing
here
with
a
simple
case
of
failure
of
proof,
the
law
or
a
gross
failure
on
the
part
of
judge
doyle,
to
have
properly
assessed
the
facts
before
him.
that
judge
doyle
is
not
unaware
of
the
ramifications
of
nor
unsympathetic
to
the
goals
of
the
amended
clayton
act,
must
be
apparent
from
his
recent
tenth
circuit
opinion,
upholding
the
federal
trade
commission's
or
the
striking
down
of
kennecott
copper's
acquisition
of
peabody
coal,
an
opinion
that
appellant
was
so
anxious
for
this
court
to
read
that
it
cited
the
case
in
their
reply
briefs
in
both
this
and
in
the
associated
narragansett
beer
case.
i
do
not
believe
that
appellant
seriously
taxes
judge
doyle
with
error.
rather,
i
believe
that
appellant
seeks
a
new
per
se
rule
in
bank
merger
litigation.
a
rule
which
would
require
us
to
discard
the
standards
of
testing
bank
merger
cases
set
down
by
this
court
in
brown
shoe
just
10
years
ago.
there,
in
determining
whether
a
merger
would
in
reasonable
probability,
substantially
lessen
competition,
this
court
noted
seven
aspects,
“varying
in
importance
with
the
merger
under
consideration
which
would
properly
be
taken
into
consideration.”
those
relevant
to
this
kind
of
litigation,
i
believe,
are
six,
whether
the
industry
is
fragmented
or
concentrated,
whether
there
has
been
an
elimination
of
an
undue
number
of
competitors,
whether
there
has
been
a
recent
trend
towards
concentration
in
a
few
leaders,
whether
there
was
ready
entry
of
new
competitors,
whether
the
size
of
the
acquiring
company
had
been
increased
to
the
point
where
it
threatened
to
develop
decisive
advantages
vis-à-vis
competitors.
and
finally,
whether
a
substantial
factor
on
competition
had
been
eliminated.
now,
in
the
next
year
in
philadelphia
bank,
this
court
observed
that
in
a
merger
between
direct
competitors
where
the
merger
occasioned
a
insignificant
increase
in
concentration,
the
government
was
entitled
to
a
rebuttable
presumption
that
the
merger
would
substantially
lessen
competition.
i
believe
that
the
case
law
since
that
date
has
followed
the
lead
of
these
two
early
cases.
again,
i
reiterate
that
in
my
judgment,
i
think
that
appellant
here
is
seeking
to
create
a
per
se
rule
a)
not
insubstantial
share
of
state
deposits
may
not
acquire
a
not
insubstantial
share
of
local
deposits.
these
numbers
had
been
as
little
as
12%
of
state
share,
as
little
as
eight-tenths
of
a
percent
of
state
share
in
the
acquired
institution,
and
as
little
as
15%
of
the
effective
market
in
the
arena
of
competition
served
by
the
acquired
institution.
we
say
it
is
a
per
se
rule
because
appellant
comes
to
this
court
seeking
authority
to
bar
an
acquisition
without
having
sustained
its
burden
of
proof
on
any
of
the
six
areas
of
inquiry
this
court
found
relevant
in
brown
shoe.
rather
it
was
the
appellees,
who
brought
on
evidence
on
each
of
these
six
points,
evidence
which
we
believe
fairly
establishes
a
negative
of
each
said
proposition.
in
truth,
appellant
has
no
evidence,
nor
any
serious
claim
if
this
merger
will,
in
reasonable
probability,
substantially
lessen
competition
in
greeley
or
anywhere
else.
it
is
projecting
a
theory
and
i
believe
that
theory
to
be,
put
a
lid
on
any
significant
acquisitions
by
holding
companies
or
developing
statewide
banks
and
you
will
force
them
to
seek
out
their
avenues
of
growth.
these
ought
to
mean
more
inference
in
some
markets
and
that
is
desirable.
we,
the
appellees,
deny
the
advocacy
of
this
scheme.
more
particularly,
do
we
deny
that
it's
judiciary,
is
the
appropriate
forum
to
seek
the
implementation
for
such
a
scheme.
social
planning
on
this
scale
is
a
legislative
function.
as
this
court
noted
in
brown
shoe,
the
congress
was
interested
in
stopping
mergers
which
had
certain
enumerated
effects.
if
the
justice
department
seeks
to
reach
mergers
which
do
not
have
those
effects,
that
it
seek
appropriate
authority.
i
should
like
to
review
the
six
points
and
their
relevance
to
this
case
and
since
this
court
has
seen
fit
to
set
this
case
for
argument
with
the
falstaff
in
narragansett
case,
i
will
point
out
at
each
instance
the
relevance
--
the
relevant
statistical
analysis
for
the
beer
industry
as
well.
the
first
criterion
was
whether
the
industry
is
fragmented
or
concentrated.
in
the
united
states,
there
were
13,759
banks
at
year-end
1971.
the
10
largest
banks
in
united
states
had
19%
of
industry
capacity,
the
100
largest
49%.
comparably
in
--
in
the
beer
industry,
we
had
the
four
largest.
there
were
79
brewers
at
the
end
of
1970,
the
four
largest
having
43%
of
industry
capacity.
looking
at
the
market
in
colorado,
not
a
market
but
looking
at
the
--
the
arena
for
inquiry,
there
were
228
banks
at
year-end
1970.
in
weld
county
more
--
more
close
to
the
market
in
question,
this
is
one
of
2810
counties
in
the
united
states
with
less
than
100,000
in
population.
there
are
only
three
counties
in
the
united
states
of
that
size
which
have
more
banking
organization
serving
it
than
weld
county
has
today.
in
greeley,
we
now
have
seven
banks
and
five
banking
organizations.
now,
comparing
greeley
to
all
cities
in
similar
size
pattern
30,000
to
50,000,
we
find
that
99
plus
percent
are
served
by
no
more.
only
one
city
in
the
united
states
has
as
many
banking
--
has
more
banking
organizations
that
serve
really
now.
but
in
appellant's
arithmetic
view
of
what
concentration
means,
banking
in
greeley
with
38,000
people
and
five
banking
organizations
is
just
as
concentrated
as
any
other
city,
no
matter
what
its
size
with
five
banking
organizations.
to
appellant,
the
competitive
factors
would
appear
to
be
the
same.
thus
last
year,
when
the
largest
banking
organization
in
ohio,
bank
ohio
corporation,
with
one
and
a
half
billion
dollars
in
deposits,
acquired
a
$250
million
akron
national
bank
and
sent
for
in
bank
shares
of
cleveland
with
1.1
billion
acquired
the
american
bank
of
commerce,
a
bank,
with
a
$150
million.
appellant
did
not
sue
in
either
case.
we
do
not
claim
that
these
instances
violated
the
clayton
act
but
we
are
--
we
do
believe
that
they
form
a
sound
basis
for
comparison
on
the
competitive
values,
we
ought
to
describe
the
term
concentration.
in
absolute
size
in
--
in
akron,
the
acquiring
banking
organizations
were
two
to
three
times
the
size
of
bancorporation
and
the
acquired
banks
were
four
to
six
times
besides
of
the
first
national
treeby.
even
in
relative
state
size,
the
akron
national
had
a
greater
share
of
state
deposits
than
did
fnb
group.
the
decisive
factor
in
deciding
not
to
sue
appears
to
have
been
the
relative
share
of
state
deposit
totals
held
by
the
acquiring
institutions
probably
between
5%
and
7%
in
those
two
instances.
appellant
permitted
acquisitions
in
the
market
by
two
of
the
five
largest
banking
organizations
in
ohio
because
it
apparently
viewed
the
two
6%
market
shares
are
not
limiting
the
universe
of
potential
entrance
too
severe.
but
we
think
that
this
emphasis
is
distorted.
akron
has
250,000
--
275,000
people.
it
ought
to
be
able
to
support,
many
times
the
number
of
banks
that
a
city
of
38,000
can.
a
city
of
275,000
people
and
five
banks
is,
we
believe,
in
a
competitive
sense,
a
more
concentrated
market
tha
a
city
of
38,000
people
on
the
same
number
of
banks.
one
would
have
expected
a
rational
competitive
policy
to
instruct
at
the
akron
mergers
first
and
the
prospect
that
greeley
could
support
more
banks
given
its
size,
is
we
believe,
remote.
mr.
eugene
j.
metzger
no
sir,
the
problem
is
whether
or
not
the
market
can
responsibly
carry
as
many
--
and
anymore
institutions.
in
this
very
case,
governor
mitchell,
in
approving
the
--
this
affiliation
said,
overall,
the
data
suggests
that
an
additional
office
of
a
major
bank
by
de
novo
entry
is
not
needed
in
wealth.
similar
data
for
comparable
population
suggests
that
a
fourth
unit
or
holding
company
banking
office
in
greeley
would
likely
dilute
the
quality
of
banking
services
by
restricting
opportunities
for
achieving
economies
of
scale
because
of
market
fragmentation.
it
is
our
contention
that,
and
this
is
from
defendant's
exhibit
no.
48
in
the
record.
it
is
our
contention
that
given
a
different
size,
the
smaller
cities
simply
cannot
accommodate
as
a
matter
of
logic
and
reason,
any
more
institutions
than
a
certain
frame
of
reference
if
you
have
in
cities
of
the
size
of
greeley
anywhere
between
two
and
five
has
as
a
norm
for
the
number
of
banking
institutions.
i
would
say
that
if
you
found
two
or
three
in
a
given
city
and
the
question
came
up,
“is
an
acquisition
there
desirable
or
undesirable?”
i
think
it
--
it
could
be
properly
considered
by
the
court
that
other
cities
of
similar
size
have
been
able
to
accommodate
more
banking
institutions
serving
them.
but
given
the
fact
that
greeley
is
on
the
upper
fringes
of
the
--
the
capability
of
absorbing
banking
institutions,
given
the
whole
--
the
whole
united
states
as
a
sample
from
which
to
draw
in
examining
the
logical
structure
of
banking
markets,
i
think
that
the
answer
has
to
be
that
we
have
to
recognize
that
there
are
business
limitations
upon
the
number
of
institutions
we
ought
to
force
into
these
markets.
and
greeley
has
certainly
have
the
upper
edge
of
those
limitations.
let
me
give
you
some
example.
akron's
peers
support
many
more
banks
than
it
does.
charlotte,
north
carolina,
for
example,
with
240,000
people
somewhat
smaller
than
akron
and
located
in
what
appellant
has
characterized
to
be
a
highly
concentrated
state
has
14
banks
certainly.
similarly
with
richmond,
virginia
or
sacramento,
california,
all
states
that
are
characterized
as
highly
concentrated,
they
have
two
and
three
times
the
number
of
banking
organizations
serving
in
akron.
i
asked
which
is
more
concentrated
in
any
meaningful
sense,
akron
or
greeley.
and
further,
it
is
only
in
relation
to
these
largest
cities,
akron
or
perhaps
even
larger
cities
but
the
word
substantial
entry
referred
to,
by
my
colleague
this
morning,
takes
on
any
real
content.
if
we
were
to
enter,
say,
if
we
were
able
to
enter
and
willing
to
enter
a
city
the
size
of
greeley
today,
business
requirements
would
limit
us
to
a
--
a
shopping
center
kind
of
entry,
a
lending
officer
and
a
couple
of
girls
behind
the
(inaudible)
but
if
we
would
to
try
and
enter
a
city
the
size
of
akron,
perhaps
appropriate
entry
would
require
three
or
four
officers.
and
given
that
a
pro
tanto
the
--
where
its
substantiality
takes
on
some
context
similarly
to
the
--
to
the
beer
industry
where
your
entry
can
be
a
matter
of
choice.
you
can
open
a
--a
brewery
of
a
size
that
is
directed
by
your
own
decisions
to
what
you
can
and
cannot
do.
in
banking,
you
can't
enter
a
market
and
say,
“we're
going
to
open
a
$40
million
bank.
you
must
wait
until
you
have
deposits
in
that
market
against
which
to
make
loans
and
those
loans,
in
--
in
turn,
generate
your
income.”
you
enter
a
small
market
in
a
small
way.
it
simply
would
be
a
bad
business
judgment
to
do
anything
else.
the
second
criterion
is
whether
there
has
been
an
elimination
of
an
undue
number
of
competitors.
now,
the
net
number
of
banks
in
the
united
states
increased
from
13,431
in
1961
to
13,759
in
1971.
that's
an
increase
of
328
banks.
i
--
i
mentioned
that
because
of
the
opinion
in
philadelphia
which
spoke
of
the
loss
of
700
banks
in
the
previous
decade
as
being
significant
to
the
extent
that
that
is
significant,
the
increment
since
1961
is
equally
so.
by
way
of
comparison,
the
number
of
brewers
in
united
states
was
404
in
1947.
that
has
dropped
to
79
in
1970.
in
colorado,
again,
we
are
speaking
of
an
increase
in
the
number
of
banking
organizations.
the
number
of
banking
organizations
in
the
state
in
1960
was
162.
today,
it
is
198.
in
greeley,
in
1960,
we
had
three
competitors.
today,
we
have
five.
the
third
--
the
third
point
that
this
court
conceived
to
be
relevant
in
assessing
whether
or
not
a
merger
might
tend
to
substantiate
us
in
competition
was
whether
there
had
been
a
recent
trend
towards
concentration
in
a
few
leaders.
now,
in
the
united
states
in
1940,
the
10
largest
banks
had
27%
of
the
total
deposit
in
1940.
that
dropped
to
19.9%
in
1970.
the
100
largest
similarly
dropped
from
57%
to
49.9%.
now,
there
had
been
some
mergers
as
counsel
pointed
out,
but
banking
is
an
industry
which
requires
mergers.
you
cannot
go
out
of
business
in
banking
simply
by
packing
your
bags
and
--
and
abandoning
the
--
the
premises
as
you
can
in
any
other
business
or
start
attempting
to
solve
as
important
a
dollar
as
you
can
get.
the
old,
the
halt,
the
infirm,
the
inefficient,
in
banking,
must
be
disposed
off
by
this
route.
the
question
is,
however,
whether
or
not
there
had
been
a
trend
towards
concentration
which
there
certainly
has
not.
there
has
been
in
this
industry
and
in
a
state,
a
trend
away
from
concentration.
comparing
a
game
to
the
beer
industry,
the
four
national
brewers,
anheuser-busch,
pabst,
schlitz
and
millers
had
23%
of
industry
capacity
in
1960,
29%
in
1964,
and
43%
in
1970.
the
fourth
criterion
was
whether
there
had
been
ready
entry
of
new
competitors.
now,
between
1960
and
1970,
there
were
1,763
new
banks
organized
in
the
united
states.
the
technical
and
financial
requirements
for
a
new
bank
charter
can
be
as
little
as
a
single
qualified
lending
officer
and
$50,000
in
capital.
by
contrast,
there
has
been
one
new
brewer
in
united
states
in
the
past
25
years,
that
a
canadian
brewer
entering
the
country
through
expansion.
the
brewery
size
required
for
the
de
novo
entry
is
a
$1
million
barrel
capacity,
an
expenditure
of
$20
million
for
a
plant
--
a
plant
and
equipment
and
another
$10
or
$15
million
for
distribution
and
advertising
facilities.
in
colorado,
there
had
been
64
new
banks
organized
between
1950,
1960
and
1970.
fifty-four
of
those
new
banks
organized
by
entrepreneurs
not
associated
with
any
of
the
holding
companies
in
the
state.
now,
those
banks
have
done
just
as
well
and
some
better
than
the
holding
company
if
it
is
in
the
markets
in
question.
frankly,
a
new
bank,
a
small
bank
in
a
given
market
will
improve
its
market
position
depending
upon
the
energy
and
the
capability
of
the
executive
running
it.
we
do
not
have
a
monopoly
on
talent.
in
addition
to
the
54
new
entrepreneurs
other
than
the
--
the
holding
companies
who
have
opened
new
banks
in
this
area,
the
state
alone
denied
45
more
charters
basically
on
grounds
of
lack
of
need
and
the
national,
probably
as
many
during
that
time
spent.
the
fifth
criterion
was
whether
the
size
of
the
acquiring
company
had
been
increased
to
the
point
were
threatened
to
develop
the
size
of
advantages
over
its
competitors
and
this
is
one
of
the
points
in
which
we
are
supposed
to
--
to
create
a
danger
because
of
our
size.
now,
as
we
pointed
out,
the
--
the
western
bank
corporation
is
20
times
our
size
and
it
does
business
in
colorado
at
three
locations.
it
acquired
three
banks
there
in
1956
in
a
race
to
beat
the
deadline
of
the
bank
holding
company
act
and
it
operates
in
three
markets
--
has
operated
in
those
three
markets
for
over
15
years.
for
over
five
years,
the
united
bank
shares,
which
is
again
20%
larger
than
our
size,
has
operated
in
four
markets
in
that
state.
they
--
this
gives
us
some
predicate
to
--
to
assess
whether
or
not
we
would
likely
inhibit
the
formation
of
new
banks
or
whether
our
entry
would
be
likely
to
increase
inordinately
the
market
share
of
the
bank
that
we
acquired.
and
what
is
the
market
experience
of
those
seven
--
in
those
seven
markets
that
this
organization
is
larger
than
us?
in
three,
the
banks
in
question,
lost
market
share
of
3%
or
more.
in
one,
it
gained
1.3%.
in
three,
its
market
share
changed
by
less
than
1%.
in
all
of
these
markets,
new
banks
were
organized
and
had
flourished,
since
these
larger
institutions
ended
those
markets.
and
the
sixth
and
final
criterion
was
whether
a
substantial
factor
in
competition
has
been
eliminated.
there
were
five
banking
organizations
serving
greeley,
prior
to
this
affiliation
if
it
is
accomplished.
there
will
be
five
after
this
affiliation,
so
that
the
number
of
entrants
will
not
have
changed,
but
the
quality
will.
the
first
national
of
greeley
has
been
an
ineffective
competitor
in
this
market
for
over
20
years.
it
has
had
a
steady
attrition
of
its
market
share.
it
has
had
an
--
a
--
a
weak
management
in
many
areas
of
technical
competence.
it
has
had
a
strong
imbalance
in
the
services
that
if
offers.
this
was
based
upon
unchallenged
--
unchallenged
testimony
below.
there
was
unchallenged
testimony
further
that
bancorporation
is
a
tough
competitor,
in
a
tough
banking
market
and
that
really
was
an
ineffective
competitor,
in
a
not
very
competitive
banking
market.
i
believe
under
those
circumstances
that
we
can
only
improve
the
quality
of
competitive
activity
in
that
market.
appellant's
assault
on
the
development
of
statewide
banking
organizations
through
affiliation
with
leading,
both
banks
is
buttoned
on
a
premise
that
there
is
no
qualitative
difference
between
the
order
of
competition
obtaining
in
those
local
markets
either
before
or
after
the
affiliation.
their
thesis,
i
believe,
to
be,
that
nothing
would
have
changed
in
those
markets,
save
that
the
statewide
organizations
ultimately
would
interface
in
more
markets
so
that
the
effect
of
any
agreement
on
their
part
not
to
compete
would
have
the
repercussions
in
more
markets.
i
believe
that
the
premise
is
invalid.
as
i
pointed
out
not
only
in
greeley,
but
throughout
the
state,
something
does
change
when
those
statewide
banks
enter
local
markets.
in
most
such
markets,
the
quality
of
competition
is
improved
markedly.
in
some,
the
very
concept
of
competition
is
introduced
where
it
has
never
existed
before.
there
was
unchallenged,
again
unchallenged
testimony
below,
from
responsible
experts
that
the
smaller
cities
in
colorado,
including
really
are
not
very
competitive
but
that
denver
is
a
competitive
market
and
that
the
first
national
of
denver,
the
principal
subsidiary
of
bancorporation
is
a
competitive
institution.
thus,
against
the
possibilities
that
statewide
organizations
in
colorado
might
change
from
the
vigorously
competitive
practices
they
now
follow
in
denver.
to
concert,
we
must
weigh
the
fact
that
the
banks
that
they
are
assimilating
are
not
now
very
competitive
while
they
are
competitive.
and
this
is
the
point
of
the
amicus
brief
filed
by
the
commonwealth
of
virginia.
in
1962,
virginia
adopted
state
laws
designed
to
encourage
the
coalescence
of
leading
local
banks
into
statewide
systems.
it
did
so
because
it
sought
to
improve
the
quality
of
competition
in
banks
throughout
the
state
and
virginia
reports
to
us
that
it
has
succeeded.
at
the
expense
of
doubling
meaningless
statewide
concentration
ratios,
and
having
the
number
of
banks,
virginia
has
improved
the
quality
of
its
banking.
moving
to
what
we
believe
to
be
the
relevant
context,
local
banking
markets,
where
the
both
of
us
are
constrained
to
seek
our
assistance,
the
same
time
span
has
seen
a
sharp
increase
in
a
number
of
banking
alternatives
for
banking
market
while
the
local
market
shares
of
the
leading
banks,
the
true
arenas
of
competition
have
declined
markedly.
north
carolina
has
followed
an
identical
pattern
over
the
same
time
span.
since
this
point
is,
i
believe
critical,
i'd
like
you
to
bear
with
me
for
a
moment
while
i
cite
some
numbers.
i
believe
they
focus
precisely
the
dispute
before
us
today.
between
1960
and
1970,
the
number
of
banking
alternatives
in
all
virginia
cities
of
5,000
persons
or
more
rose
from
2.8
alternatives
to
four.
between
1960
and
1972,
the
number
of
banking
alternatives
in
all
north
carolina
cities,
of
4,000
or
more,
rose
from
2.2
to
four.
now,
this
is
not
part
of
a
general
pattern
in
a
country.
virginia
and
north
carolina
now
stand
far
above
national
loans
in
terms
of
banking
alternatives
per
city.
in
the
united
states
as
a
whole,
taking
the
various
smaller-city-sized
categories,
we
have
cities
of
5,000
to
10,000
have
an
average
of
1.99
banking
alternatives.
virginia
is
21%
higher.
north
carolina
at
34%,
10,000
to
15,000,
2.41
average,
virginia
38%
higher,
north
carolina
57,
15,000
to
30,000,
virgina
13%
higher,
north
carolina
60%.
cities
of
30,000
to
50,000,
virginia
52%
higher,
north
carolina,
the
same.
i
think
it
is
undisputable
that
the
very
result
that
justice
fears
might
happen
in
time
in
colorado
and
which
it
claims
justifies
this
suit
has
in
virginia
and
north
carolina
had
important
pro-competitive
effects.
both
states
are
much
better
competitive
environments
than
they
were.banking
markets
in
both
states
have
far
more
competitive
options
than
they
did
before
and
far
more
than
other
states
now
have.
i
believe
that
what
justice
is
telling
us
this
morning
is
that,
yes,
perhaps
this
is
good
but
our
way
is
better.
choices
between
social
goods
are,
however,
i
believe,
a
legislative
and
not
a
judicial
function.
that
their
route
is
better,
arguendo,
which
i
deny,
which
i
believe,
will
preserve
local
on
plates
of
monopoly,
far
beyond
their
time,
that
their
route
could
be
better,
cannot
transform
a
competitive
good
into
a
probable
substantial
lessening
of
competition
and
that
is
the
litmus
against
which
this
court
would
test
this
affiliation.
now
plainly,
i
have
been
speaking
to
date
only
as
to
uncontested
facts
below.
this
--
on
those
uncontested
facts,
this
is
not
the
sort
of
merger
that
section
vii
of
the
clayton
act
was
designed
to
reach,
by
standards
laid
down
by
this
court.
this
has
been
demonstrated
without
regard
to
those
disputed
questions
as
to
whether
we
are
in
fact
a
potential
end
or
not
or
and
if
so,
how
important
(inaudible)
i
should
like
now
briefly
to
touch
upon
those
points.
that
this
merger
removes
bancorporation
as
a
present
or
perspective
competitive
force
is,
of
course,
true
of
any
merger.
that
the
removal
of
bancorporation
as
a
perspective
competitor
would,
in
reasonable
probability,
substantially
lessen
competition
in
greeley
is
a
proposition,
which
i
believe,
appellant
hopes
to
carry
solely
by
repetition
in
the
teeth
of
the
evidence.
bancorporation
is
represented
to
be
a
present
competitive
force
in
that
we
significantly
influence
the
conduct
of
present
entrance.
they
have,
we
are
told,
modified
their
competitive
conduct.
that
is,
work
harder,
taking
less
profit,
by
reason
of
our
presence
on
the
edge
of
their
market.
the
testimony
in
this
case
was
absolutely
undisputed,
uncracked
on
cross-examination
flatly
that
their
conduct
have
not
been
effective
in
any
way,
by
any
concept
that
we
might
enter
or
not
enter
that
market.
this
appellant's
ipsi
dixit
to
triumph
over
this
uncontested
evidentiary
base,
appellant
believes
that
six
competitors
in
greeley
would
be
better
than
five.
one
more
is
better
and
the
absence
of
the
prospect
of
the
six,
do
they
substantially
end
a
competitive
event.
let
us
assume,
arguendo,
that
six
competitors
would
reduce
pro
tanto
the
prospect
of
anticompetitive
conduct
and
would
be
therefore
desirable.
the
same
could
be
said
of
a
set
or
20.
where
ought
a
line
be
drawn?
we
think
without
attempting
to
delineate
precise
contours,
no
substantial
lessening
of
competition
ought
be
associated
with
any
market
served
by
the
largest
number
of
banking
organizations
that
serve
cities
of
similar
size.
even,
however,
if
we
assume
that
greeley
is
in
critical
need
of
a
six
banking
organization,
we
are
not
a
potential
de
novo
entrant
into
that
market.
now,
it
has
been
suggested
that
we
should
in
reasonable
prospect
have
entered
this
market
by
other
means,
absent
of
this
affiliation
and
that
any
reasonable
person
would
have
done
so
even
though
we
have
said
that
we
would
not.
the
objective
evidence
was
said
to
go
contrary
to
what
we
would
propose.
now,
let's
look
at
that
objective
contention
from
the
frame
of
reference
of
a
banking
organization
in
denver,
like
bancorporation.
it
looks
out
across
the
state
at
the
available
alternatives
to
it
for
de
novo
entry.
it
would
exclude
pueblo,
which
is
a
city
that
has
had
considerable
economic
difficulties
for
a
long
period
of
time.
and
it
looks
out
across
the
state
and
it
sees
greeley
as
one
of
the
possible
alternatives.
so
it
measures
that
and
says
“what
has
been
the
growth
of
deposits
in
that
market
in
the
last
10
years?”
we
find
that
the
growth
of
deposits
in
greeley
is
less
than
the
average
for
the
whole
state.
that
is
not
necessarily
dispositive.
however,
we
look
to
the
change
in
the
number
of
banking
organization
serving
greeley
and
the
rest
of
the
state.
and
we
find
that
the
number
of
banking
alternatives
in
greeley,
the
number
of
banking
offices
in
greeley,
has
grown
133%
over
that
time
span
and
that
the
number
of
banking
organization
serving
the
rest
of
the
state
has
grown
only
30%.
these
two
suggests,
objectively,
that
greeley
is
one
of
the
less
attractive
markets
in
the
state
for
de
novo
entry.
we
looked
also
to
the
question
of,
as
--
as
we
pointed
out
earlier,
how
many
alternatives
are
available
in
the
city,
and
we
see
there
are
five.
and
we
say
to
ourselves,
“is
this
a
desirable
market
to
enter
de
novo
when
only
one
other
city
in
the
entire
united
states
has
that
many
alternatives
and
that,
a
special
situation.
that
would
suggest
objectively
that
this
is
not
a
desirable
thing.
greeley
has
the
most
population
for
commercial
banking
office
of
any
city
of
20,000
or
more
than
in
a
state
and
we
--
and
we
had,
at
the
time
of
this
complaint,
no
office
in
11
of
the
13
largest.
parenthetically,
on
that
point,
the
justice
department
suggests
in
its
reply
brief
that
we
ought
to
disregard
six
of
them
because
they
are
in
the
denver
standard
metropolitan
statistical
area.
however,
these
are
banking
markets
that
are
--
that
we
are
not
presently
in.
they
are
attractive
banking
markets.
we
do
not
have
any
significant
amount
of
business
drawn
from
them
and
the
fact
that
they
are
nearer
to
our
headquarters
ought
to
make
them
more
desirable
and
not
less.
we
believe
that
in
sum,
objectively
or
subjectively,
greeley
is
not
an
attractive
vehicle
for
de
novo
entry
up
to
this,
but
even
assuming
that
greeley
is
in
critical
need
of
another
bank
and
that
it
would
be
attractive
for
us
to
entertain,
must
we
preserve
bancorporation
to
fill
that
role.
mr.
justice
blackmun
referred
to
a
new
bank
organized
there,
the
other
day.
it
was
organized
by
the
colorado
national
bank,
which
is
a
$400
million
organization.
it
is
a
shopping
center
bank.
it
is
a
shopping
center
bank
because
that
is
all
as
a
practical
business
judgment,
you
could
have
opened
in
that
market.
a
shopping
center
bank
may
be
opened
by
anybody.
it
just
takes
a
$100,000,
$200,000
in
capital
and
amending
officer.
this
is
not
something
wherein
our
alleged
speciality
would
add
anything
significantly
to
the
market.
look
at
the
growth
of
the
54
banking
organizations
in
the
state
who
were
not
affiliated
with
holding
companies.
they
have
grown
as
efficiently
and
effectively,
examine
defendant's
exhibit
2,
if
you
will,
on
that
question,
as
any
of
subsidiary
of
the
--
the
holding
company.
there
is
no
special
magic
to
a
--a
shopping
center
or
an
--a
neighborhood
bank
and
that
is
all
that
the
city
of
greeley
could
afford
to
take
on.
distinguish
this
from
the
(inaudible)
where
effective
entry
into
a
given
market
requires
$35
million.
mr.
eugene
j.
metzger
if
the
fifth
point,
that
this
court
raised
in
brown
shoe
were
at
issue,
no.
if
this
--
if
an
acquisition
of
this
type
were
--
were
so
significant
or
--
or
the
combination
of
acquisition
to
take
place
before,
we
have
had
none
prior
to
this
one.
if
the
combination
of
these
acquisitions
had
brought
about
a
situation
where
we
threatened
to
become
dominant
in
this
or
any
other
market
that
we
were
serving,
no.
that
would
not
be
the
end
of
the
case.
certainly,
the
accretion
to
our
power
is
a
relevant
area
for
us
to
inquire.
to
take
a
--
an
extreme
example
of
a
case
where
even
if
the
possibility
were
that
little,
if
new
york
city
only
had
two
banking
organization
serving
it
and
they
were
both
owned
by
the
same
man
and
someone
came
to,
they
point
to
regulatory
agencies
and
said,
“this
has
been
owned
by
the
same
family
for
--
for
200
years.
we
want
to
--
we
want
to
put
them
into
a
holding
company
and
then
make
it
one
organization."
i
would
be
inclined
to
say
you
ought
to
deny
that,
because
that
situation
is
so
critical.
that
market
is
so
--
so
badly
out
of
luck
with
the
--
with
the
natural
and
normal
structure
of
a
market
of
that
size
but
you
won't
preserve
any
opportunity
to
possibly
be
concentrated
at
some
point
in
time.
mr.
eugene
j.
metzger
well,
i'm
trying
to
take
the
(inaudible)
a
market,
the
more
heavily
concentrated,
vis-à-vis
its
--
its
ability
to
absorb
banking
institutions,
the
more
carefully
we
ought
to
look
and
the
more
we
stick
to,
we
ought
to
be,
i
think,
towards
the
entry
of
these
--
these
new
institutions.
but
we
are
not
speaking
of
--
of
a
market
which
is
suffering
from
a
considerable
concentration.
indeed,
we
are
not
speaking
of
a
market
where
our
entry
would
--
would
simply
leave
alone
an
undesirable
situation.
we're
taking
over
a
bank
that's
been
losing
market
shares
steadily
for
20
years
and
have
not
been
an
effective
competitor,
and
we
propose
to
make
it
one.
in
amending
--
i
conclude
on
this
point,
in
amending
section
vii
of
the
clayton
act,
congress
established
certain
benchmarks
for
assessing
what
merges
would
transgress
the
bonds
of
the
statute.
the
standards
were
identified
and
amplified
upon
by
this
court
in
brown
shoe.
of
course,
it
is
possible
to
conceive
of
anticompetitive
effects
of
this
affiliation.
any
merger
of
companies
in
the
same
or
potentially
in
the
same
business
open
such
prospects
but
it
was
in
seeking
to
measure
probable
substantiality
of
effect
that
benchmarks
were
established
and
measured
by
those
standards.
appellant
has
failed
to
prove
his
case.
thank
you.
mr.
eugene
j.
metzger
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
in
the
statement
of
the
case
yesterday,
mr.
friedman
made
reference
to
certain
matters
outside
the
record
in
this
case
to
the
extent
that
those
matters
are
conceived
to
be
of
any
relevance
by
any
members
of
this
court,
appellees
hastened
to
say
that
we
do
not
accept
the
government's
representations
as
to
what
those
facts
are.
as
an
example
of
one
instance
in
which
we
are
in
disagreement
as
to
those
facts,
we
respectfully
direct
the
court's
attention
to
footnote
57
on
page
44
of
our
brief.
in
answer
to
a
question
from
mr.
justice
blackmun
yesterday,
it
was
suggested
that
the
government
would
not
have
brought
this
case,
had
we
chosen
the
ultimate
means
of
entry
into
the
market
in
question.
we
had
not
understood
it
to
be
the
law
that
a
merger
would
be
precluded
simply
because
there
were
ultimate
means
of
entering
into
a
particular
market
available.
we
hasten
to
say
that
we
do
not
agree
that
there
--
that
we
would,
in
reasonable
probability,
had
entered
this
market
absent
this
particular
affiliation.
however,
we
believe
that
showing
that
we
are
--
we
have
other
methods
of
entering
this
market
is
a
beginning
and
not
an
end
for
the
government's
burden
of
proof
in
these
matters.
what
seems
to
appellees
to
have
been
the
key
passage
from
the
opinion
of
the
court
below
was
a
problem.
we
have
sought
to
apply
the
standards
laid
down
by
the
supreme
court
in
naming
philadelphia
bank
and
philipsburg
bank
two
of
the
banks,
in
an
effort
to
arrive
at
an
accurate
and
fair
decision
herein.
the
main
difficulty
here
is
the
lack
of
cogent
evidence
which
even
suggest
that
there
is
likely
to
be
a
lessening
of
competition
as
a
result
of
this
present
acquisition.
nothing
has
been
presented
which
of
itself
or
considered
with
the
total
circumstances
serves
to
make
any
impact.
this
is
from
329
f.
supp.
at
page
1016.
now,
it
would
seem
then
to
me
that
we
are
dealing
here
with
a
simple
case
of
failure
of
proof,
the
law
or
a
gross
failure
on
the
part
of
judge
doyle,
to
have
properly
assessed
the
facts
before
him.
that
judge
doyle
is
not
unaware
of
the
ramifications
of
nor
unsympathetic
to
the
goals
of
the
amended
clayton
act,
must
be
apparent
from
his
recent
tenth
circuit
opinion,
upholding
the
federal
trade
commission's
or
the
striking
down
of
kennecott
copper's
acquisition
of
peabody
coal,
an
opinion
that
appellant
was
so
anxious
for
this
court
to
read
that
it
cited
the
case
in
their
reply
briefs
in
both
this
and
in
the
associated
narragansett
beer
case.
i
do
not
believe
that
appellant
seriously
taxes
judge
doyle
with
error.
rather,
i
believe
that
appellant
seeks
a
new
per
se
rule
in
bank
merger
litigation.
a
rule
which
would
require
us
to
discard
the
standards
of
testing
bank
merger
cases
set
down
by
this
court
in
brown
shoe
just
10
years
ago.
there,
in
determining
whether
a
merger
would
in
reasonable
probability,
substantially
lessen
competition,
this
court
noted
seven
aspects,
“varying
in
importance
with
the
merger
under
consideration
which
would
properly
be
taken
into
consideration.”
those
relevant
to
this
kind
of
litigation,
i
believe,
are
six,
whether
the
industry
is
fragmented
or
concentrated,
whether
there
has
been
an
elimination
of
an
undue
number
of
competitors,
whether
there
has
been
a
recent
trend
towards
concentration
in
a
few
leaders,
whether
there
was
ready
entry
of
new
competitors,
whether
the
size
of
the
acquiring
company
had
been
increased
to
the
point
where
it
threatened
to
develop
decisive
advantages
vis-à-vis
competitors.
and
finally,
whether
a
substantial
factor
on
competition
had
been
eliminated.
now,
in
the
next
year
in
philadelphia
bank,
this
court
observed
that
in
a
merger
between
direct
competitors
where
the
merger
occasioned
a
insignificant
increase
in
concentration,
the
government
was
entitled
to
a
rebuttable
presumption
that
the
merger
would
substantially
lessen
competition.
i
believe
that
the
case
law
since
that
date
has
followed
the
lead
of
these
two
early
cases.
again,
i
reiterate
that
in
my
judgment,
i
think
that
appellant
here
is
seeking
to
create
a
per
se
rule
a)
not
insubstantial
share
of
state
deposits
may
not
acquire
a
not
insubstantial
share
of
local
deposits.
these
numbers
had
been
as
little
as
12%
of
state
share,
as
little
as
eight-tenths
of
a
percent
of
state
share
in
the
acquired
institution,
and
as
little
as
15%
of
the
effective
market
in
the
arena
of
competition
served
by
the
acquired
institution.
we
say
it
is
a
per
se
rule
because
appellant
comes
to
this
court
seeking
authority
to
bar
an
acquisition
without
having
sustained
its
burden
of
proof
on
any
of
the
six
areas
of
inquiry
this
court
found
relevant
in
brown
shoe.
rather
it
was
the
appellees,
who
brought
on
evidence
on
each
of
these
six
points,
evidence
which
we
believe
fairly
establishes
a
negative
of
each
said
proposition.
in
truth,
appellant
has
no
evidence,
nor
any
serious
claim
if
this
merger
will,
in
reasonable
probability,
substantially
lessen
competition
in
greeley
or
anywhere
else.
it
is
projecting
a
theory
and
i
believe
that
theory
to
be,
put
a
lid
on
any
significant
acquisitions
by
holding
companies
or
developing
statewide
banks
and
you
will
force
them
to
seek
out
their
avenues
of
growth.
these
ought
to
mean
more
inference
in
some
markets
and
that
is
desirable.
we,
the
appellees,
deny
the
advocacy
of
this
scheme.
more
particularly,
do
we
deny
that
it's
judiciary,
is
the
appropriate
forum
to
seek
the
implementation
for
such
a
scheme.
social
planning
on
this
scale
is
a
legislative
function.
as
this
court
noted
in
brown
shoe,
the
congress
was
interested
in
stopping
mergers
which
had
certain
enumerated
effects.
if
the
justice
department
seeks
to
reach
mergers
which
do
not
have
those
effects,
that
it
seek
appropriate
authority.
i
should
like
to
review
the
six
points
and
their
relevance
to
this
case
and
since
this
court
has
seen
fit
to
set
this
case
for
argument
with
the
falstaff
in
narragansett
case,
i
will
point
out
at
each
instance
the
relevance
--
the
relevant
statistical
analysis
for
the
beer
industry
as
well.
the
first
criterion
was
whether
the
industry
is
fragmented
or
concentrated.
in
the
united
states,
there
were
13,759
banks
at
year-end
1971.
the
10
largest
banks
in
united
states
had
19%
of
industry
capacity,
the
100
largest
49%.
comparably
in
--
in
the
beer
industry,
we
had
the
four
largest.
there
were
79
brewers
at
the
end
of
1970,
the
four
largest
having
43%
of
industry
capacity.
looking
at
the
market
in
colorado,
not
a
market
but
looking
at
the
--
the
arena
for
inquiry,
there
were
228
banks
at
year-end
1970.
in
weld
county
more
--
more
close
to
the
market
in
question,
this
is
one
of
2810
counties
in
the
united
states
with
less
than
100,000
in
population.
there
are
only
three
counties
in
the
united
states
of
that
size
which
have
more
banking
organization
serving
it
than
weld
county
has
today.
in
greeley,
we
now
have
seven
banks
and
five
banking
organizations.
now,
comparing
greeley
to
all
cities
in
similar
size
pattern
30,000
to
50,000,
we
find
that
99
plus
percent
are
served
by
no
more.
only
one
city
in
the
united
states
has
as
many
banking
--
has
more
banking
organizations
that
serve
really
now.
but
in
appellant's
arithmetic
view
of
what
concentration
means,
banking
in
greeley
with
38,000
people
and
five
banking
organizations
is
just
as
concentrated
as
any
other
city,
no
matter
what
its
size
with
five
banking
organizations.
to
appellant,
the
competitive
factors
would
appear
to
be
the
same.
thus
last
year,
when
the
largest
banking
organization
in
ohio,
bank
ohio
corporation,
with
one
and
a
half
billion
dollars
in
deposits,
acquired
a
$250
million
akron
national
bank
and
sent
for
in
bank
shares
of
cleveland
with
1.1
billion
acquired
the
american
bank
of
commerce,
a
bank,
with
a
$150
million.
appellant
did
not
sue
in
either
case.
we
do
not
claim
that
these
instances
violated
the
clayton
act
but
we
are
--
we
do
believe
that
they
form
a
sound
basis
for
comparison
on
the
competitive
values,
we
ought
to
describe
the
term
concentration.
in
absolute
size
in
--
in
akron,
the
acquiring
banking
organizations
were
two
to
three
times
the
size
of
bancorporation
and
the
acquired
banks
were
four
to
six
times
besides
of
the
first
national
treeby.
even
in
relative
state
size,
the
akron
national
had
a
greater
share
of
state
deposits
than
did
fnb
group.
the
decisive
factor
in
deciding
not
to
sue
appears
to
have
been
the
relative
share
of
state
deposit
totals
held
by
the
acquiring
institutions
probably
between
5%
and
7%
in
those
two
instances.
appellant
permitted
acquisitions
in
the
market
by
two
of
the
five
largest
banking
organizations
in
ohio
because
it
apparently
viewed
the
two
6%
market
shares
are
not
limiting
the
universe
of
potential
entrance
too
severe.
but
we
think
that
this
emphasis
is
distorted.
akron
has
250,000
--
275,000
people.
it
ought
to
be
able
to
support,
many
times
the
number
of
banks
that
a
city
of
38,000
can.
a
city
of
275,000
people
and
five
banks
is,
we
believe,
in
a
competitive
sense,
a
more
concentrated
market
tha
a
city
of
38,000
people
on
the
same
number
of
banks.
one
would
have
expected
a
rational
competitive
policy
to
instruct
at
the
akron
mergers
first
and
the
prospect
that
greeley
could
support
more
banks
given
its
size,
is
we
believe,
remote.
mr.
eugene
j.
metzger
no
sir,
the
problem
is
whether
or
not
the
market
can
responsibly
carry
as
many
--
and
anymore
institutions.
in
this
very
case,
governor
mitchell,
in
approving
the
--
this
affiliation
said,
overall,
the
data
suggests
that
an
additional
office
of
a
major
bank
by
de
novo
entry
is
not
needed
in
wealth.
similar
data
for
comparable
population
suggests
that
a
fourth
unit
or
holding
company
banking
office
in
greeley
would
likely
dilute
the
quality
of
banking
services
by
restricting
opportunities
for
achieving
economies
of
scale
because
of
market
fragmentation.
it
is
our
contention
that,
and
this
is
from
defendant's
exhibit
no.
48
in
the
record.
it
is
our
contention
that
given
a
different
size,
the
smaller
cities
simply
cannot
accommodate
as
a
matter
of
logic
and
reason,
any
more
institutions
than
a
certain
frame
of
reference
if
you
have
in
cities
of
the
size
of
greeley
anywhere
between
two
and
five
has
as
a
norm
for
the
number
of
banking
institutions.
i
would
say
that
if
you
found
two
or
three
in
a
given
city
and
the
question
came
up,
“is
an
acquisition
there
desirable
or
undesirable?”
i
think
it
--
it
could
be
properly
considered
by
the
court
that
other
cities
of
similar
size
have
been
able
to
accommodate
more
banking
institutions
serving
them.
but
given
the
fact
that
greeley
is
on
the
upper
fringes
of
the
--
the
capability
of
absorbing
banking
institutions,
given
the
whole
--
the
whole
united
states
as
a
sample
from
which
to
draw
in
examining
the
logical
structure
of
banking
markets,
i
think
that
the
answer
has
to
be
that
we
have
to
recognize
that
there
are
business
limitations
upon
the
number
of
institutions
we
ought
to
force
into
these
markets.
and
greeley
has
certainly
have
the
upper
edge
of
those
limitations.
let
me
give
you
some
example.
akron's
peers
support
many
more
banks
than
it
does.
charlotte,
north
carolina,
for
example,
with
240,000
people
somewhat
smaller
than
akron
and
located
in
what
appellant
has
characterized
to
be
a
highly
concentrated
state
has
14
banks
certainly.
similarly
with
richmond,
virginia
or
sacramento,
california,
all
states
that
are
characterized
as
highly
concentrated,
they
have
two
and
three
times
the
number
of
banking
organizations
serving
in
akron.
i
asked
which
is
more
concentrated
in
any
meaningful
sense,
akron
or
greeley.
and
further,
it
is
only
in
relation
to
these
largest
cities,
akron
or
perhaps
even
larger
cities
but
the
word
substantial
entry
referred
to,
by
my
colleague
this
morning,
takes
on
any
real
content.
if
we
were
to
enter,
say,
if
we
were
able
to
enter
and
willing
to
enter
a
city
the
size
of
greeley
today,
business
requirements
would
limit
us
to
a
--
a
shopping
center
kind
of
entry,
a
lending
officer
and
a
couple
of
girls
behind
the
(inaudible)
but
if
we
would
to
try
and
enter
a
city
the
size
of
akron,
perhaps
appropriate
entry
would
require
three
or
four
officers.
and
given
that
a
pro
tanto
the
--
where
its
substantiality
takes
on
some
context
similarly
to
the
--
to
the
beer
industry
where
your
entry
can
be
a
matter
of
choice.
you
can
open
a
--a
brewery
of
a
size
that
is
directed
by
your
own
decisions
to
what
you
can
and
cannot
do.
in
banking,
you
can't
enter
a
market
and
say,
“we're
going
to
open
a
$40
million
bank.
you
must
wait
until
you
have
deposits
in
that
market
against
which
to
make
loans
and
those
loans,
in
--
in
turn,
generate
your
income.”
you
enter
a
small
market
in
a
small
way.
it
simply
would
be
a
bad
business
judgment
to
do
anything
else.
the
second
criterion
is
whether
there
has
been
an
elimination
of
an
undue
number
of
competitors.
now,
the
net
number
of
banks
in
the
united
states
increased
from
13,431
in
1961
to
13,759
in
1971.
that's
an
increase
of
328
banks.
i
--
i
mentioned
that
because
of
the
opinion
in
philadelphia
which
spoke
of
the
loss
of
700
banks
in
the
previous
decade
as
being
significant
to
the
extent
that
that
is
significant,
the
increment
since
1961
is
equally
so.
by
way
of
comparison,
the
number
of
brewers
in
united
states
was
404
in
1947.
that
has
dropped
to
79
in
1970.
in
colorado,
again,
we
are
speaking
of
an
increase
in
the
number
of
banking
organizations.
the
number
of
banking
organizations
in
the
state
in
1960
was
162.
today,
it
is
198.
in
greeley,
in
1960,
we
had
three
competitors.
today,
we
have
five.
the
third
--
the
third
point
that
this
court
conceived
to
be
relevant
in
assessing
whether
or
not
a
merger
might
tend
to
substantiate
us
in
competition
was
whether
there
had
been
a
recent
trend
towards
concentration
in
a
few
leaders.
now,
in
the
united
states
in
1940,
the
10
largest
banks
had
27%
of
the
total
deposit
in
1940.
that
dropped
to
19.9%
in
1970.
the
100
largest
similarly
dropped
from
57%
to
49.9%.
now,
there
had
been
some
mergers
as
counsel
pointed
out,
but
banking
is
an
industry
which
requires
mergers.
you
cannot
go
out
of
business
in
banking
simply
by
packing
your
bags
and
--
and
abandoning
the
--
the
premises
as
you
can
in
any
other
business
or
start
attempting
to
solve
as
important
a
dollar
as
you
can
get.
the
old,
the
halt,
the
infirm,
the
inefficient,
in
banking,
must
be
disposed
off
by
this
route.
the
question
is,
however,
whether
or
not
there
had
been
a
trend
towards
concentration
which
there
certainly
has
not.
there
has
been
in
this
industry
and
in
a
state,
a
trend
away
from
concentration.
comparing
a
game
to
the
beer
industry,
the
four
national
brewers,
anheuser-busch,
pabst,
schlitz
and
millers
had
23%
of
industry
capacity
in
1960,
29%
in
1964,
and
43%
in
1970.
the
fourth
criterion
was
whether
there
had
been
ready
entry
of
new
competitors.
now,
between
1960
and
1970,
there
were
1,763
new
banks
organized
in
the
united
states.
the
technical
and
financial
requirements
for
a
new
bank
charter
can
be
as
little
as
a
single
qualified
lending
officer
and
$50,000
in
capital.
by
contrast,
there
has
been
one
new
brewer
in
united
states
in
the
past
25
years,
that
a
canadian
brewer
entering
the
country
through
expansion.
the
brewery
size
required
for
the
de
novo
entry
is
a
$1
million
barrel
capacity,
an
expenditure
of
$20
million
for
a
plant
--
a
plant
and
equipment
and
another
$10
or
$15
million
for
distribution
and
advertising
facilities.
in
colorado,
there
had
been
64
new
banks
organized
between
1950,
1960
and
1970.
fifty-four
of
those
new
banks
organized
by
entrepreneurs
not
associated
with
any
of
the
holding
companies
in
the
state.
now,
those
banks
have
done
just
as
well
and
some
better
than
the
holding
company
if
it
is
in
the
markets
in
question.
frankly,
a
new
bank,
a
small
bank
in
a
given
market
will
improve
its
market
position
depending
upon
the
energy
and
the
capability
of
the
executive
running
it.
we
do
not
have
a
monopoly
on
talent.
in
addition
to
the
54
new
entrepreneurs
other
than
the
--
the
holding
companies
who
have
opened
new
banks
in
this
area,
the
state
alone
denied
45
more
charters
basically
on
grounds
of
lack
of
need
and
the
national,
probably
as
many
during
that
time
spent.
the
fifth
criterion
was
whether
the
size
of
the
acquiring
company
had
been
increased
to
the
point
were
threatened
to
develop
the
size
of
advantages
over
its
competitors
and
this
is
one
of
the
points
in
which
we
are
supposed
to
--
to
create
a
danger
because
of
our
size.
now,
as
we
pointed
out,
the
--
the
western
bank
corporation
is
20
times
our
size
and
it
does
business
in
colorado
at
three
locations.
it
acquired
three
banks
there
in
1956
in
a
race
to
beat
the
deadline
of
the
bank
holding
company
act
and
it
operates
in
three
markets
--
has
operated
in
those
three
markets
for
over
15
years.
for
over
five
years,
the
united
bank
shares,
which
is
again
20%
larger
than
our
size,
has
operated
in
four
markets
in
that
state.
they
--
this
gives
us
some
predicate
to
--
to
assess
whether
or
not
we
would
likely
inhibit
the
formation
of
new
banks
or
whether
our
entry
would
be
likely
to
increase
inordinately
the
market
share
of
the
bank
that
we
acquired.
and
what
is
the
market
experience
of
those
seven
--
in
those
seven
markets
that
this
organization
is
larger
than
us?
in
three,
the
banks
in
question,
lost
market
share
of
3%
or
more.
in
one,
it
gained
1.3%.
in
three,
its
market
share
changed
by
less
than
1%.
in
all
of
these
markets,
new
banks
were
organized
and
had
flourished,
since
these
larger
institutions
ended
those
markets.
and
the
sixth
and
final
criterion
was
whether
a
substantial
factor
in
competition
has
been
eliminated.
there
were
five
banking
organizations
serving
greeley,
prior
to
this
affiliation
if
it
is
accomplished.
there
will
be
five
after
this
affiliation,
so
that
the
number
of
entrants
will
not
have
changed,
but
the
quality
will.
the
first
national
of
greeley
has
been
an
ineffective
competitor
in
this
market
for
over
20
years.
it
has
had
a
steady
attrition
of
its
market
share.
it
has
had
an
--
a
--
a
weak
management
in
many
areas
of
technical
competence.
it
has
had
a
strong
imbalance
in
the
services
that
if
offers.
this
was
based
upon
unchallenged
--
unchallenged
testimony
below.
there
was
unchallenged
testimony
further
that
bancorporation
is
a
tough
competitor,
in
a
tough
banking
market
and
that
really
was
an
ineffective
competitor,
in
a
not
very
competitive
banking
market.
i
believe
under
those
circumstances
that
we
can
only
improve
the
quality
of
competitive
activity
in
that
market.
appellant's
assault
on
the
development
of
statewide
banking
organizations
through
affiliation
with
leading,
both
banks
is
buttoned
on
a
premise
that
there
is
no
qualitative
difference
between
the
order
of
competition
obtaining
in
those
local
markets
either
before
or
after
the
affiliation.
their
thesis,
i
believe,
to
be,
that
nothing
would
have
changed
in
those
markets,
save
that
the
statewide
organizations
ultimately
would
interface
in
more
markets
so
that
the
effect
of
any
agreement
on
their
part
not
to
compete
would
have
the
repercussions
in
more
markets.
i
believe
that
the
premise
is
invalid.
as
i
pointed
out
not
only
in
greeley,
but
throughout
the
state,
something
does
change
when
those
statewide
banks
enter
local
markets.
in
most
such
markets,
the
quality
of
competition
is
improved
markedly.
in
some,
the
very
concept
of
competition
is
introduced
where
it
has
never
existed
before.
there
was
unchallenged,
again
unchallenged
testimony
below,
from
responsible
experts
that
the
smaller
cities
in
colorado,
including
really
are
not
very
competitive
but
that
denver
is
a
competitive
market
and
that
the
first
national
of
denver,
the
principal
subsidiary
of
bancorporation
is
a
competitive
institution.
thus,
against
the
possibilities
that
statewide
organizations
in
colorado
might
change
from
the
vigorously
competitive
practices
they
now
follow
in
denver.
to
concert,
we
must
weigh
the
fact
that
the
banks
that
they
are
assimilating
are
not
now
very
competitive
while
they
are
competitive.
and
this
is
the
point
of
the
amicus
brief
filed
by
the
commonwealth
of
virginia.
in
1962,
virginia
adopted
state
laws
designed
to
encourage
the
coalescence
of
leading
local
banks
into
statewide
systems.
it
did
so
because
it
sought
to
improve
the
quality
of
competition
in
banks
throughout
the
state
and
virginia
reports
to
us
that
it
has
succeeded.
at
the
expense
of
doubling
meaningless
statewide
concentration
ratios,
and
having
the
number
of
banks,
virginia
has
improved
the
quality
of
its
banking.
moving
to
what
we
believe
to
be
the
relevant
context,
local
banking
markets,
where
the
both
of
us
are
constrained
to
seek
our
assistance,
the
same
time
span
has
seen
a
sharp
increase
in
a
number
of
banking
alternatives
for
banking
market
while
the
local
market
shares
of
the
leading
banks,
the
true
arenas
of
competition
have
declined
markedly.
north
carolina
has
followed
an
identical
pattern
over
the
same
time
span.
since
this
point
is,
i
believe
critical,
i'd
like
you
to
bear
with
me
for
a
moment
while
i
cite
some
numbers.
i
believe
they
focus
precisely
the
dispute
before
us
today.
between
1960
and
1970,
the
number
of
banking
alternatives
in
all
virginia
cities
of
5,000
persons
or
more
rose
from
2.8
alternatives
to
four.
between
1960
and
1972,
the
number
of
banking
alternatives
in
all
north
carolina
cities,
of
4,000
or
more,
rose
from
2.2
to
four.
now,
this
is
not
part
of
a
general
pattern
in
a
country.
virginia
and
north
carolina
now
stand
far
above
national
loans
in
terms
of
banking
alternatives
per
city.
in
the
united
states
as
a
whole,
taking
the
various
smaller-city-sized
categories,
we
have
cities
of
5,000
to
10,000
have
an
average
of
1.99
banking
alternatives.
virginia
is
21%
higher.
north
carolina
at
34%,
10,000
to
15,000,
2.41
average,
virginia
38%
higher,
north
carolina
57,
15,000
to
30,000,
virgina
13%
higher,
north
carolina
60%.
cities
of
30,000
to
50,000,
virginia
52%
higher,
north
carolina,
the
same.
i
think
it
is
undisputable
that
the
very
result
that
justice
fears
might
happen
in
time
in
colorado
and
which
it
claims
justifies
this
suit
has
in
virginia
and
north
carolina
had
important
pro-competitive
effects.
both
states
are
much
better
competitive
environments
than
they
were.banking
markets
in
both
states
have
far
more
competitive
options
than
they
did
before
and
far
more
than
other
states
now
have.
i
believe
that
what
justice
is
telling
us
this
morning
is
that,
yes,
perhaps
this
is
good
but
our
way
is
better.
choices
between
social
goods
are,
however,
i
believe,
a
legislative
and
not
a
judicial
function.
that
their
route
is
better,
arguendo,
which
i
deny,
which
i
believe,
will
preserve
local
on
plates
of
monopoly,
far
beyond
their
time,
that
their
route
could
be
better,
cannot
transform
a
competitive
good
into
a
probable
substantial
lessening
of
competition
and
that
is
the
litmus
against
which
this
court
would
test
this
affiliation.
now
plainly,
i
have
been
speaking
to
date
only
as
to
uncontested
facts
below.
this
--
on
those
uncontested
facts,
this
is
not
the
sort
of
merger
that
section
vii
of
the
clayton
act
was
designed
to
reach,
by
standards
laid
down
by
this
court.
this
has
been
demonstrated
without
regard
to
those
disputed
questions
as
to
whether
we
are
in
fact
a
potential
end
or
not
or
and
if
so,
how
important
(inaudible)
i
should
like
now
briefly
to
touch
upon
those
points.
that
this
merger
removes
bancorporation
as
a
present
or
perspective
competitive
force
is,
of
course,
true
of
any
merger.
that
the
removal
of
bancorporation
as
a
perspective
competitor
would,
in
reasonable
probability,
substantially
lessen
competition
in
greeley
is
a
proposition,
which
i
believe,
appellant
hopes
to
carry
solely
by
repetition
in
the
teeth
of
the
evidence.
bancorporation
is
represented
to
be
a
present
competitive
force
in
that
we
significantly
influence
the
conduct
of
present
entrance.
they
have,
we
are
told,
modified
their
competitive
conduct.
that
is,
work
harder,
taking
less
profit,
by
reason
of
our
presence
on
the
edge
of
their
market.
the
testimony
in
this
case
was
absolutely
undisputed,
uncracked
on
cross-examination
flatly
that
their
conduct
have
not
been
effective
in
any
way,
by
any
concept
that
we
might
enter
or
not
enter
that
market.
this
appellant's
ipsi
dixit
to
triumph
over
this
uncontested
evidentiary
base,
appellant
believes
that
six
competitors
in
greeley
would
be
better
than
five.
one
more
is
better
and
the
absence
of
the
prospect
of
the
six,
do
they
substantially
end
a
competitive
event.
let
us
assume,
arguendo,
that
six
competitors
would
reduce
pro
tanto
the
prospect
of
anticompetitive
conduct
and
would
be
therefore
desirable.
the
same
could
be
said
of
a
set
or
20.
where
ought
a
line
be
drawn?
we
think
without
attempting
to
delineate
precise
contours,
no
substantial
lessening
of
competition
ought
be
associated
with
any
market
served
by
the
largest
number
of
banking
organizations
that
serve
cities
of
similar
size.
even,
however,
if
we
assume
that
greeley
is
in
critical
need
of
a
six
banking
organization,
we
are
not
a
potential
de
novo
entrant
into
that
market.
now,
it
has
been
suggested
that
we
should
in
reasonable
prospect
have
entered
this
market
by
other
means,
absent
of
this
affiliation
and
that
any
reasonable
person
would
have
done
so
even
though
we
have
said
that
we
would
not.
the
objective
evidence
was
said
to
go
contrary
to
what
we
would
propose.
now,
let's
look
at
that
objective
contention
from
the
frame
of
reference
of
a
banking
organization
in
denver,
like
bancorporation.
it
looks
out
across
the
state
at
the
available
alternatives
to
it
for
de
novo
entry.
it
would
exclude
pueblo,
which
is
a
city
that
has
had
considerable
economic
difficulties
for
a
long
period
of
time.
and
it
looks
out
across
the
state
and
it
sees
greeley
as
one
of
the
possible
alternatives.
so
it
measures
that
and
says
“what
has
been
the
growth
of
deposits
in
that
market
in
the
last
10
years?”
we
find
that
the
growth
of
deposits
in
greeley
is
less
than
the
average
for
the
whole
state.
that
is
not
necessarily
dispositive.
however,
we
look
to
the
change
in
the
number
of
banking
organization
serving
greeley
and
the
rest
of
the
state.
and
we
find
that
the
number
of
banking
alternatives
in
greeley,
the
number
of
banking
offices
in
greeley,
has
grown
133%
over
that
time
span
and
that
the
number
of
banking
organization
serving
the
rest
of
the
state
has
grown
only
30%.
these
two
suggests,
objectively,
that
greeley
is
one
of
the
less
attractive
markets
in
the
state
for
de
novo
entry.
we
looked
also
to
the
question
of,
as
--
as
we
pointed
out
earlier,
how
many
alternatives
are
available
in
the
city,
and
we
see
there
are
five.
and
we
say
to
ourselves,
“is
this
a
desirable
market
to
enter
de
novo
when
only
one
other
city
in
the
entire
united
states
has
that
many
alternatives
and
that,
a
special
situation.
that
would
suggest
objectively
that
this
is
not
a
desirable
thing.
greeley
has
the
most
population
for
commercial
banking
office
of
any
city
of
20,000
or
more
than
in
a
state
and
we
--
and
we
had,
at
the
time
of
this
complaint,
no
office
in
11
of
the
13
largest.
parenthetically,
on
that
point,
the
justice
department
suggests
in
its
reply
brief
that
we
ought
to
disregard
six
of
them
because
they
are
in
the
denver
standard
metropolitan
statistical
area.
however,
these
are
banking
markets
that
are
--
that
we
are
not
presently
in.
they
are
attractive
banking
markets.
we
do
not
have
any
significant
amount
of
business
drawn
from
them
and
the
fact
that
they
are
nearer
to
our
headquarters
ought
to
make
them
more
desirable
and
not
less.
we
believe
that
in
sum,
objectively
or
subjectively,
greeley
is
not
an
attractive
vehicle
for
de
novo
entry
up
to
this,
but
even
assuming
that
greeley
is
in
critical
need
of
another
bank
and
that
it
would
be
attractive
for
us
to
entertain,
must
we
preserve
bancorporation
to
fill
that
role.
mr.
justice
blackmun
referred
to
a
new
bank
organized
there,
the
other
day.
it
was
organized
by
the
colorado
national
bank,
which
is
a
$400
million
organization.
it
is
a
shopping
center
bank.
it
is
a
shopping
center
bank
because
that
is
all
as
a
practical
business
judgment,
you
could
have
opened
in
that
market.
a
shopping
center
bank
may
be
opened
by
anybody.
it
just
takes
a
$100,000,
$200,000
in
capital
and
amending
officer.
this
is
not
something
wherein
our
alleged
speciality
would
add
anything
significantly
to
the
market.
look
at
the
growth
of
the
54
banking
organizations
in
the
state
who
were
not
affiliated
with
holding
companies.
they
have
grown
as
efficiently
and
effectively,
examine
defendant's
exhibit
2,
if
you
will,
on
that
question,
as
any
of
subsidiary
of
the
--
the
holding
company.
there
is
no
special
magic
to
a
--a
shopping
center
or
an
--a
neighborhood
bank
and
that
is
all
that
the
city
of
greeley
could
afford
to
take
on.
distinguish
this
from
the
(inaudible)
where
effective
entry
into
a
given
market
requires
$35
million.
mr.
eugene
j.
metzger
if
the
fifth
point,
that
this
court
raised
in
brown
shoe
were
at
issue,
no.
if
this
--
if
an
acquisition
of
this
type
were
--
were
so
significant
or
--
or
the
combination
of
acquisition
to
take
place
before,
we
have
had
none
prior
to
this
one.
if
the
combination
of
these
acquisitions
had
brought
about
a
situation
where
we
threatened
to
become
dominant
in
this
or
any
other
market
that
we
were
serving,
no.
that
would
not
be
the
end
of
the
case.
certainly,
the
accretion
to
our
power
is
a
relevant
area
for
us
to
inquire.
to
take
a
--
an
extreme
example
of
a
case
where
even
if
the
possibility
were
that
little,
if
new
york
city
only
had
two
banking
organization
serving
it
and
they
were
both
owned
by
the
same
man
and
someone
came
to,
they
point
to
regulatory
agencies
and
said,
“this
has
been
owned
by
the
same
family
for
--
for
200
years.
we
want
to
--
we
want
to
put
them
into
a
holding
company
and
then
make
it
one
organization."
i
would
be
inclined
to
say
you
ought
to
deny
that,
because
that
situation
is
so
critical.
that
market
is
so
--
so
badly
out
of
luck
with
the
--
with
the
natural
and
normal
structure
of
a
market
of
that
size
but
you
won't
preserve
any
opportunity
to
possibly
be
concentrated
at
some
point
in
time.
mr.
eugene
j.
metzger
well,
i'm
trying
to
take
the
(inaudible)
a
market,
the
more
heavily
concentrated,
vis-à-vis
its
--
its
ability
to
absorb
banking
institutions,
the
more
carefully
we
ought
to
look
and
the
more
we
stick
to,
we
ought
to
be,
i
think,
towards
the
entry
of
these
--
these
new
institutions.
but
we
are
not
speaking
of
--
of
a
market
which
is
suffering
from
a
considerable
concentration.
indeed,
we
are
not
speaking
of
a
market
where
our
entry
would
--
would
simply
leave
alone
an
undesirable
situation.
we're
taking
over
a
bank
that's
been
losing
market
shares
steadily
for
20
years
and
have
not
been
an
effective
competitor,
and
we
propose
to
make
it
one.
in
amending
--
i
conclude
on
this
point,
in
amending
section
vii
of
the
clayton
act,
congress
established
certain
benchmarks
for
assessing
what
merges
would
transgress
the
bonds
of
the
statute.
the
standards
were
identified
and
amplified
upon
by
this
court
in
brown
shoe.
of
course,
it
is
possible
to
conceive
of
anticompetitive
effects
of
this
affiliation.
any
merger
of
companies
in
the
same
or
potentially
in
the
same
business
open
such
prospects
but
it
was
in
seeking
to
measure
probable
substantiality
of
effect
that
benchmarks
were
established
and
measured
by
those
standards.
appellant
has
failed
to
prove
his
case.
thank
you.
