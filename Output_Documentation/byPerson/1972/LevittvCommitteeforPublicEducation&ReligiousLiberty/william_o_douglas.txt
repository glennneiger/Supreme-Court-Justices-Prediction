question
in
this

might
very
well
be
whether
the
process
of
testing
can
in
fact
be
separated
from
the
basic
overall
process
of
teaching?
bearing
that
in
mind,
am
i
correct
in
my
understanding
that
all
of

are
standard
tests
prescribed
by

are
they
all
multiple

may
any
of
the
tests
be
answered

narrative
questions
that
require
discretion
on
the

are

the
district
court
couldn't
even
figure
out
whether
the
amount
paid
would
equal
the
cost
of
the
school

exceeded
it?
justice
