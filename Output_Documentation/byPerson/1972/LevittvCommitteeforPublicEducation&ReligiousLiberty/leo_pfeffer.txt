mr.
leo
pfeffer
i
understand
it,
yes.
that
is
the
situation
in
new
york.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
it
is
rather
unusual
and
it's
a
reality
of
--
of
the
--
the
influence
and
political
power
which
groups
have
in
new
york
which
has
been
able
to
resist
this.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
well
--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
well
that's
entirely
true.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
that
their
question
was
--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
--
whether
they're
on
the
general
level,
of
our
exceptional
persons
who
--
who
have
and
i
think
is
about
a
general
level,
it
is
assumed
--
a
general
assumption
that
out
of
the
training
if
necessary
affects
the
teaching.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
on
the
elementary
school
level.
the
--
i
don't
know
that
the
state
equipped
in
that
sense.
there
is
an
overall
private
power
of
visitation
which
is
that
i
understand
it.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
i
don't
think
the
record
does
to
take
my
own
understanding
is
that.
it
doesn't
have,
at
least,
in
the
elementary
school
level.
it
may
have
it
on
secondary
school,
or
it
doesn't
have.
the
position
of
the
appellees
in
this
case
is
that
this
act,
chapter
138
is
not
what
it
purports
be.
but
whether
it
is
considered
what
it
really
is
or
whether
it's
considered
what
it
purports
to
be,
is
equally
unconstitutional
under
the
establishment
clause.
the
act
purports
to
be
a
law
of
to
compensate
private
schools
for
certain
service
which
are
mandated
by
law
and
regulation.
but
aside
from
a
sort
of
talismanic
reference
to
it,
perhaps
to
satisfy
the
purpose
effect
requirement
which
had
been
expressed
before
this
law
was
enacted.
the
declaratory,
the
(inaudible),
it's
declaration
of
purpose
refers
to
these
mandated
services
of
testing
and
record-keeping.
and
that
is
the
last
there
is
in
the
law.
the
rest,
the
operational
act,
part
of
the
act
has
no
reference
to
it.
each
school
gets
a
specific
amount
per
child,
$28
for
each
pupil
in
grades
one
to
six,
$45
in
each
--
for
each
pupil,
grades
six
through
12.
it
matters
not
whether
the
--
this
is
the
way
that
the
--
the
law
is
interpreted
and
applied
by
the
state.
it
matters
not
that
the
actual
cost
of
these
mandated
services
in
a
particular
year
is
$1
or
$5
or
$10.
the
school
gets
$28
per
student
or
$45
per
student
without
regard
to
what
is
expected.
the
school
is
not
required
to
account
for
the
money.
it
gets
the
money
per
student
and
does
with
it
what
it
wills.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
well,
it
certainly
could,
now
let
me
--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
according
to
the
--
the
--
according
to
the
application
of
construction
of
the
statute
by
the
state,
yes.
and
this
is
what
is
expressed
in
the
exhibit
g.
exhibit
g
which
was
a
second
of
these,
in
litem
cost
analysis
made
not
before
the
law
was
enacted,
but
after
the
lawsuit
was
started,
for
the
purpose
of
defending
the
lawsuit.
they
took
a
few
selected
schools
and
they
found
out
what?
they
found
out
these
few
selected
schools
in
the
first
that
they're
involved
in
this.
that's
about
two-thirds
of
the
amount.
this
is
two-third
the
amount
which
is
--
which
was
found
to
be
the
cost
is
used
for
in-school,
which
means
teachers'
examinations.
only
one-third,
this
was
found
in
post-test.
only
one-third
can
be
ascribed
to
examinations
such
as
those
which
come
from
the
state,
record-keeping,
everything
else.
and
the
--
the
defendant's
brief
on
--
defendant's
brief
admits
this
on
page
16
of
defendant's
brief.
it
says,
state
of
new
york
admits
that
the
--
the
(inaudible)
take
an
overwhelming
majority
of
tests.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
on
page
16
--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
--
of
main
brief,
(inaudible)
brief
of
the
state
of
new
york.
so,
under
the
bottom
of
the
page,
the
overwhelming
the
majority
of
tests
given
on
public
and
non-public
schools
alike
are
formulated,
administered,
and
created
by
teachers.
these
are
the
tests
which
take
care
of
two-thirds
of
the
whole
cost.
eliminate
that
and
you
have
an
amount
which
is
considered
to
be
substantially
less
than
the
amount
which
is
given
per
student.
but
even
that
is
not
relevant
because
the
state
takes
a
position
that
is
irrelevant
how
much
money
is
spent
for
these
mandated
services.
the
amount
is
given
per
pupil
and
not
on
the
basis
of
what
the
cost
is.
these
cost
analysis
were
not
applied
by
law.
they
were
made
in
litem
for
the
purpose
of
preparing
for
this
--
for
this
case
after
we
brought
the
suit.
and
that
--
and
the
--
the
stake
--
states
in
this
interrogatory,
it
was
a
part
of
interrogatory.
it
does
not
ask
what
the
money
is
for.
it
doesn't
require
any
reporting.
and
it
takes
a
position
that
the
amount
is
fixed
by
law
and
this
is
the
amount
which
is
unchangeable
whether
the
costs
go
up
or
go
down.
now,
there's
another
point
which
i'd
like
to
call
the
court's
attention.
i
think
ms.
coon
is
not
correct
in
stating
that
this
money
is
used
to
reimburse
for
expenditures
already
made.
the
law
was
passed
in
1970
to
take
effect
the
following
year.
and
during
each
year,
the
school
gets
per
pupil
according
to
the
amount
of
students
in
that
--
during
that
current
year.
the
first
year,
the
school
is
allowed
to
choose,
the
months
of
september,
october,
november,
which
month
it
will
take
to
measure
the
number
of
students
to
test.
and
for
that
year,
that
is
a
number
taken
for
$28
or
$45.
thereafter,
the
year
before
the
current
year
is
used
as
a
base
year.
but
the
payment
is
not
made
for
the
base
year.
the
--
they've
already
been
paid
for
the
base
year.
the
payment
is
made
for
the
current
year
and
that's
a
fact.
that
in
the
event
that
there
is
a
difference
between
the
student
enrollment
during
the
current
year,
or
the
base
year,
an
adjustment
is
made
accordingly.
moreover,
the
act
provides
that
the
payment
is
to
be
made
in
two
portions.one
is
payable
january
15th
and
the
other
is
paid
april
15th
for
the
current
year.
now
april
15th
is
two-and-a-half
months
before
the
end
of
the
school
year.
there
is
nothing
in
the
act
or
in
its
administration
which
prevents
a
school
teacher
or
school
principal,
or
superintendent
of
the
school
of
the
religious
schools
saying
to
the
teachers,
“we're
short
of
money
for
our
religious
teaching.
we're
short
of
money
for
our
religious
worship.
we've
got
to
carve
out
in-class
tests.”
no
more
class
testing.
use
all
that
money
for
the
two-and-a-half
months.
we're
getting
it
now.
use
all
that
money
to
pay
for
catechism,
to
pay
for
religious
worship.
according
to
the
state
of
new
york,
that
is
perfectly
permissible.
there
are
no
strings
attached
to
this
money,
no
reporting,
no
auditing,
only
the
--
only
auditing
required
is
to
establish
how
many
students
there
are
during
the
year.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
your
honor
is
entirely
correct.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
that's
exactly
what
the
point
is.
this
is
what
the
court
said
in
lemon.
it's
in
the
inside
of
the
dilemma.
either
you
give
money
which
can
be
used
for
religious
purposes
which
the
court
has
said
is
unconstitutional,
in
which
case
you
have
the
(inaudible)
of
financing
religious
instruction,
or
you
audit
and
you
supervise
as
they
try
to
do
in
lemon
which
is
this
(inaudible)
of
entanglement.
the
answer
is
of
course
that
the
law
is
unconstitutional,
but
that's
not
unusual.
that's
what
the
court
said
in
lemon
against
kurtzman.
that's
what
court
said
in
tilton
against
richardson.
in
tilton
against
richardson,
the
court
report
said,
an
unrestricted
grant
of
money,
which
is
partly
used
to
build
a
building,
which
after
20
years
may
be
used
to
hold
religious
classes,
that's
unconstitutional.
you
cannot
have
a
“no
strings
attached”
grant
of
money
to
a
religious
school.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
the
question
here
is
not
that
case,
your
honor.
(voice
overlap)
mr.
leo
pfeffer
bad
case?
mr.
leo
pfeffer
oh
bad
faith.
not
according
to
--
i'm
sorry.
not
according
to
the
interpretation
which
the
state
has
given
up
its
law
the
(voice
overlap)
mr.
leo
pfeffer
this
is
what
--
this
is
what
the
state
is
doing.
this
is
what
the
state
is
doing.
the
state
gave
this
money.
this
--
your
honor,
the
state
gives
money
before
it
made
this
cost,
selective
cost
analysis.
for
a
whole
year
it
gave
it
to
them.
it
has
not
a
question
--
what
are
you
doing
with
the
money?
the
money
was
given.
they'd
used
the
money
for
whatever,
at
will.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
not
according
to
--
now
look,
the
only
statutory
requirement
is
going
to
state
of
new
york,
the
only
statutory
requirements.
this
is
in
--
your
response
to
the
interrogatories.
mr.
justice
blackmun
asked
whether
this,
the
new
york
courts
have
interpreted
this?
but
new
york
courts
haven't,
because
they
can't.
new
york
is
the
one
state
of
the
union
which
doesn't
have
a
lot
taxpayer
suits.
we've
tried
taxpayer
suits.
we've
been
thrown
out
of
court.
in
one
state
in
the
union
we
can't
get
into
the
court.
so,
the
only
court
we
can
get
into
and
get
into
because
(inaudible)
is
a
federal
court.
but
new
york
has
not,
according
to
the
defense,
when
we
sued
in
the
state
of
new
york,
has
not
interpreted
this
law,
as
requiring
anything.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
the
attorney
general
is
defending
this
court.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
i
don't
think
he
can
because
the
according
to
the
state's
interpretation,
they're
not
required
to.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
thank
you.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
honors
please,
the
complaint
in
this
action,
challenges
the
law,
add
on
its
face
and
as
construed
and
applied.
i've
devoted
myself
up
till
now,
to
the
law
as
applied.
and
i've
have
pointed
out
that
the
law
as
applied
does
not
require
the
schools
to
in
anyway
account
for
the
money
received.
this
is
substantiated
and
it
is
established
by
the
interrogatories
was
submitted
to
the
state
and
their
response
to
it
on
the
appendix
pages
87a
and
88a
in
which
the
state
says
the
qualifying
schools
are
not
required
to
submit
the
reports
and
copy
for
the
moneys
received
and
how
they
are
expended.
also,
that
means,
it's
a
free
--
they
have
a
freehand
on
it,
no
strings
attached.
also,
i
want
to
call
to
the
court's
attention
to
the
fact
that
as
applied
and
this
is
--
comes
from
the
second
of
the
in
litem
cost
analysis
made
by
the
state
after
the
suit
was
started,
that
in
two
typical
schools
which
they
selected,
the
catholic
central
high
school
and
the
north
shore
hebrew
academy
and
i
point
this
out,
i
get
these
references
on
page
one
in
my
brief.
the
schools
--
the
first
school
received
$77,878
under
the
law.
taking
in
account
everything
other
than
teachers'
examinations,
that
means
this
region's
examination
of
pupil
evaluation
tests,
record-keeping,
health-keeping,
everything
conceivable
under
the
act
which
is
mandated,
which
is
not
mandated
and
this
includes
indirect
costs
and
so-called
kind
and
benefit
cost
which
these
teachers
give
as
in
--
in
kind
taking
them
all.
according
to
the
state's
own
cost
analysis,
the
sum
total
of
all
these,
the
most
liberally
interpreted
mandated
service
is
$24,674
which
is
less
than
one-third
of
the
amount
received
under
the
statute.
the
only
way
you
can
justify
this
statute
is
the
other
two-thirds
of
it,
is
if
teachers
examination,
the
kind
of
examination
which
a
teacher
give
in
every
school,
oral
or
written,
daily
quizzes,
weekly
quizzes
are
included.
you
get
two-thirds
of
sum
total
is
set.
the
same
is
true
with
the
second,
also
in
page
20.
the
second
typical
school,
the
north
shore
hebrew
academy,
they
receive
for
$5,400
mr.
leo
pfeffer
page
20
of
my
brief.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
yes,
that
gets
the
page
references
to
the
--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
yeah.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
page
20
--
it's
on
exhibit
d
and
exhibit
g,
$5400
as
north
shore
academy
received
under
the
statute.
its
total
cost
for
other
than
in-school
teachers'
testing,
is
$1776
again
less
than
one-third.
so
that
the
answer
to
the
question
which
was
just
to
justice
blackmun.
if
this
statute
were
interpreted
narrowly
to
limit
it
only
to
these,
to
exclude
teacher's
test
and
quizzes.
the
guts
of
the
statute
will
be
out.
two-thirds
of
the
amount
would
be
destroyed.
now
there's
no
question
that's
not
worth
an
answer.
now,
but
assume
–
assume
the
statute
is
what
is
says
to
this.
i
will
now,
at
this
point,
accept
the
statute
at
face
value
and
accept
that
teachers'
examinations
is
a
kind
of
teaching,
a
kind
of
examinations
which
are
done
every
day
on
schools
take
up
two-thirds
of
the
time.
that
that
is
what
is
properly
within
the
statute.
it's
our
opinion
that
this
statute
is
unconstitutional
on
its
face
for
a
variety
of
reasons.
it's
indistinguishable
from
lemon
against
kurtzman.
ms.
coon
has
responded
to
a
question
put
by
one
member
of
the
court
as
to
whether
teaching
itself
is
not
mandated,
which
was
involved
in
lemon
against
kurtzman,
teaching,
teaching
of
the
secular
subjects.
her
actual
--
i
was
unable
to
quite
understand.
she
said
it's
not
mandated
because
the
school
voluntarily
establishes
itself
to
teach.
if
it
didn't
voluntarily
establish
itself
to
teach,
it
wouldn't
be
required
to
teach.
but
that's
equally
true
about
these
reporting.
if
a
school,
the
private
school
did
not
voluntarily
undertake
to
teach,
they
wouldn't
to
have
to
or
submit
reports
of
any
kind.
it's
their
--
the
statute
in
new
york
as
in
pennsylvania,
hasn't
ruled
that.
it
requires
a
number
of
things.
it
requires
that
you
teach
certain
nine
or
eight
or
nine
basic
courses
which
was
involved
in
lemon
against
kurtzman
and
dicenso
against
robinson.
it
also
requires
that
you'll
keep
records
and
you
report
them.
i
can
see
no
distinction
between
them.
if
one
is
unconstitutional,
i
can't
see
how
the
other
is
--
is
constitutional.
moreover,
keeping
records,
and
testing
is
not
the
only
thing
required
of
these
schools
by
law.
they're
required
to
be
safe,
they're
required
to
be
sanitary,
they're
required
to
be
well
lit,
they're
required
be
in
every
way
respected
–
acceptable.
otherwise,
they're
violating
the
law.
as
ms.
coon
suggests,
that
because
the
state
requires
that
schools
be
safe
and
sanitary
and
lit
and
heated,
that
the
state
can
constitutionally,
on
the
statute
of
clause
pay
for
the
fuel
bills,
pay
for
the
lighting
bills,
repair
the
buildings,
the
church
buildings
--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
--
they're
both
happening.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
i
would
say
that's
constitutional
provided,
mr.
chief
justice,
provided
the
schools
were
account
--
were
required
to
account
that
they
did
that
particular
thing.
that
they
used
the
money
for
that
purpose,
for
the
inoculations,
but
this
not
required
here.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
no.
that
would
not
be
entanglement.
this
is
what,
the
difference
between
this
case
and
everson
--
and
--
and
how,
there
is
no
religious
aspect
to
an
inoculation.
you
--
that
inoculation
doesn't
but
as
the
court
pointed
out
in
lemon
against
kurtzman,
there
was
only
a
world
of
a
difference
in
teaching.
a
teacher
can't
if
this
is
from
the
lemon,
a
teacher
can
and
while
he
may
not,
some
may,
some
may
not,
may
use
the
teaching
for
the
purpose
of
inducting
any
religion.
and
this
is
exactly
equally
respected
testing.
if
you
include
in-class
testing,
and
i
have
put
forth
in
my
brief
examples
of
testing
in
respect
to
the
most
valued
three
subjects
of
mathematics.
i've
given
examples
of
actually
types
of
(inaudible)
used
and
proposed
in
which
you're
fully
impregnated
with
religious
values.
now,
i
don't
say
that
the
school
--
any
of
the
schools
in
new
york
use
those
tests.
i
don't
know
whether
they
do
it
or
they
don't
but
that's
not
important.
the
point
that
--
the
court
pointed
out
in
lemon,
that
the
point
is
that
only
to
make
sure
as
a
must
in
order
to
avoid
financing
religion
to
make
sure
that
it
doesn't
do
it,
this
state
has
an
obligation
to
maintain
a
continuing
surveillance.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
the
--
the
entanglement
would
be
limited
to
--
not
to
examining
what's
taught,
to
limit
it
just
to
a
doctor's
certificate.
yes,
we
inoculate
50
students
here
and
we
have
to
pay
for
$250.
there
are
no
entanglements
there.
that's
not
entanglement.
that's
not
the
surveillances
of
--
of
going
over
the
test.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
in
this
case?
mr.
leo
pfeffer
well,
i
would
say
that
even
if
they
did,
i
don't
believe
that
would
be
unconstitutional
provided,
provided
there
was
auditing
to
show
that
the
money
was
used
for
tha
purpose.
but
that's
--
that's
just
the
--
you
don't
reach
real
entanglements
surveillance.
all
you
get
is
a
--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
well,
(voice
overlap)
i
think
will
be
such
a
--
a
limited
entanglement.
i
don't
think
it'll
excessive
entanglement.
it
doesn't
get
into
that
guts
of
what
the
school
is
for.
a
school
isn't
establishing
(voice
overlap)
an
inoculation
to
teach.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
yes.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
i
don't
--
i
don't
think
that
will
be
unconstitutional
provided,
i
think
that
amount
of
entanglement
in
a
case
of
health
it
would
not
be
an
excessive
entanglement.
but
we're
dealing
with
--
we're
dealing
with
testing
which
is
done
in
the
classroom.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
oh,
that
would
be
difficult
thing
if
it
is
because
a
christian
science
couldn't
accept
it,
because
if
it
couldn't,
it
wouldn't
be
a
(voice
overlap)
mr.
leo
pfeffer
then
i
think
it
would
be
unconstitutional.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
because
there,
giving
the
money
would
be
there
for
use
for
an
–
an
--
either
unlawfully
of
an
unconstitutional
purpose.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
oh,
we'll
say
it's
--
or
is
the
christian
science
school
accepted
it
and
use
for
--
for
inoculations?
oh
that
will
be
all
right.
that
will
be
all
right.
i
think
so.
now,
the
point
is,
i
think
it
is
completely
unrealistic.
i
think
it's
just
as
a
fantasy
world
to
seek
to
the
divorce
testing,
day
by
day
testing,
examinations
written
on
a
front
page.
from
the
days
of
plato,
those
testings
have
been
the
basic
way
of
teaching,
the
major
way
of
teaching
religion
as
a
catechism.
that's
traditionally,
what
is
a
catechism?
it's
a
form
of
teaching
by
testing.
the
teacher
asks
questions,
the
student
answers.
if
a
student
answers
correctly
he's
learning
his
lesson.
if
he's
somehow
stucky,
he
studies
some
more.
every
student
knows
that
in
order
to
pass
his
course,
he
has
to
pass
examinations.
how
do
you
pass
examinations?
you
give
the
teacher
what
the
teacher
wants,
how?
now,
you
take
the
two
schools
here,
the
catholic
academy
and
the
north
--
the
hebrew
academy
and
the
catholic
school.
i
am
certain,
that
a
student
in
a
catholic
central
high
school
would
not
answer
a
question
on
history
on
the
reformation
the
way
the
same
question
would
be
answered
by
a
student
in
lutheran
high
school.
or
take
a
question
on
the
origins
of
christianity.
i
am
sure
that
a
student
in
the
north
shore
hebrew
academy
would
not,
if
he
wants
to
pass
the
course,
answer
that
question
the
same
way
that
a
student
in
the
catholic
central
school
will
do.
teaching
is
two
ways.
one
way,
and
the
least
effective
way,
is
for
this
teacher
to
stand
in
front
and
lecture
and
lecture.
and
then
send
the
students
home.
a
most
effective
way
is
for
the
teacher
to
get
it
from
the
students.
that's
way
it's
done.
and
the
state
says,
it
applies
to
everyday
teaching,
written,
and
art.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
i
know
of
no
such
case,
under
oath.
i
don't
think
it
applies
here
because
these
are
elementary
schools.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
from
grade
one
to
six.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
but
i
don't
know
of
any
such
thing.
i
don't
know
--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
well
the
--
the
--
my
answer
to
that
would
be,
that
the
rotc
is
generally
as
far
as
i
know
up
until
now,
is
at
college
level,
and
in
tilton
versus
richardson,
this
court
held
that
there
are
more
liberal
rules
with
respect
to
--
at
the
college
level
than
expect
the
elementary
and
high
school
level.
so
that,
i
don't
think
it
would
necessarily
be
the
same
answer.
i
would
have
reservations
on
the
elementary
and
secondary
sides
and
level.
it
would
certainly
have
reservations
on
it.
now,
in
lemon,
this
court
said
that,
in
lemon
and
dicenso
that
the
state
of
rhode
island
and
the
state
of
pennsylvania
were
obligated
under
the
constitution,
as
well
as
in
the
statute
to
see
to
it
that
the
money
given
to
the
teachers
was
used
only
for
secular
teaching.
that
it
couldn't
have
given
the
money
and
say,
use
it
for
secular
teaching
but
make
no
examination,
no
verification
whether
it's
been
used
as
a
purpose.
and
then
the
courts
went
and
said,
well
that
very
verification
--
you
see,
the
answer
to
mr.
justice
rehnquist's
questions,
that
very
auditing
--
that
very
surveillance,
that
very
required
constitutionally
and
statutory
requirement,
assurance
that
it
is
not
used
for
sectarian
instruction,
or
religious
worship,
that
involve,
that
surveillance
which
from
walz
through
lemon,
the
court
said
is
forbidden
by
the
establishment
clause.
yes,
it
is
true
that
--
that
if
--
if
there
were
no
audits
here
as
there
isn't,
we
call
any
stuff
constitutional
because
it
is
financing,
subsidizing
religious
education
and
if
there
is
some
audits
if
there
is
surveillance
and
there
is
policing,
we
say
it's
unconstitutional
because
it
involves
entanglement.
but
that's
not
our
dilemma.
that's
a
dilemma
of
the
establishment
clause.
that's
a
dilemma
of
a
history
of
over
a
150,
175
years
where
state
after
state,
court
after
court,
constitution
after
constitution
said
you
cannot
do
what
you're
trying
to
do
here.
you
cannot
take
tax-raised
funds
and
use
it
to
pay
part
of
the
upgraded
course
whether
it's
required
by
law
or
not
required
law
of
church
schools.
this
is
what
it's
all
about
is
what
the
establishment
clause
says
and
this
what
the
court
said
in
yoder.
that
long
before
there
was
a
public
school
system,
there
were
the
a
religion
clauses
and
that's
the
policies,
the
constitutional
interests
which
were
set
forth
in
the
religion
clause,
as
to
date,
our
educational
system
--
our
educational
system
had
to
shape
itself
to
the
establishment
in
the
free
exercise
clause,
not
the
establishment
of
free
exercise
clause
to
shape
themselves
and
fashion
themselves
to
the
educational
interest.
this
is
what
this
case
is
about.
this
--
this
case
says,
the
court
below
says,
you
cannot
take
an
import
element
of
the
budget
of
a
church
school
in
order
for
you
to
operate.
you
cannot
take
it
off
the
voluntary
contribution
of
those
who
adhere
to
and
make
an
--
an
obligation
of
every
taxpayer.
that's
a
violation
of
what,
the
establishment
clause
of
a
constitution.
your
honors,
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
i
understand
it,
yes.
that
is
the
situation
in
new
york.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
it
is
rather
unusual
and
it's
a
reality
of
--
of
the
--
the
influence
and
political
power
which
groups
have
in
new
york
which
has
been
able
to
resist
this.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
well
--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
well
that's
entirely
true.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
that
their
question
was
--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
--
whether
they're
on
the
general
level,
of
our
exceptional
persons
who
--
who
have
and
i
think
is
about
a
general
level,
it
is
assumed
--
a
general
assumption
that
out
of
the
training
if
necessary
affects
the
teaching.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
on
the
elementary
school
level.
the
--
i
don't
know
that
the
state
equipped
in
that
sense.
there
is
an
overall
private
power
of
visitation
which
is
that
i
understand
it.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
i
don't
think
the
record
does
to
take
my
own
understanding
is
that.
it
doesn't
have,
at
least,
in
the
elementary
school
level.
it
may
have
it
on
secondary
school,
or
it
doesn't
have.
the
position
of
the
appellees
in
this
case
is
that
this
act,
chapter
138
is
not
what
it
purports
be.
but
whether
it
is
considered
what
it
really
is
or
whether
it's
considered
what
it
purports
to
be,
is
equally
unconstitutional
under
the
establishment
clause.
the
act
purports
to
be
a
law
of
to
compensate
private
schools
for
certain
service
which
are
mandated
by
law
and
regulation.
but
aside
from
a
sort
of
talismanic
reference
to
it,
perhaps
to
satisfy
the
purpose
effect
requirement
which
had
been
expressed
before
this
law
was
enacted.
the
declaratory,
the
(inaudible),
it's
declaration
of
purpose
refers
to
these
mandated
services
of
testing
and
record-keeping.
and
that
is
the
last
there
is
in
the
law.
the
rest,
the
operational
act,
part
of
the
act
has
no
reference
to
it.
each
school
gets
a
specific
amount
per
child,
$28
for
each
pupil
in
grades
one
to
six,
$45
in
each
--
for
each
pupil,
grades
six
through
12.
it
matters
not
whether
the
--
this
is
the
way
that
the
--
the
law
is
interpreted
and
applied
by
the
state.
it
matters
not
that
the
actual
cost
of
these
mandated
services
in
a
particular
year
is
$1
or
$5
or
$10.
the
school
gets
$28
per
student
or
$45
per
student
without
regard
to
what
is
expected.
the
school
is
not
required
to
account
for
the
money.
it
gets
the
money
per
student
and
does
with
it
what
it
wills.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
well,
it
certainly
could,
now
let
me
--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
according
to
the
--
the
--
according
to
the
application
of
construction
of
the
statute
by
the
state,
yes.
and
this
is
what
is
expressed
in
the
exhibit
g.
exhibit
g
which
was
a
second
of
these,
in
litem
cost
analysis
made
not
before
the
law
was
enacted,
but
after
the
lawsuit
was
started,
for
the
purpose
of
defending
the
lawsuit.
they
took
a
few
selected
schools
and
they
found
out
what?
they
found
out
these
few
selected
schools
in
the
first
that
they're
involved
in
this.
that's
about
two-thirds
of
the
amount.
this
is
two-third
the
amount
which
is
--
which
was
found
to
be
the
cost
is
used
for
in-school,
which
means
teachers'
examinations.
only
one-third,
this
was
found
in
post-test.
only
one-third
can
be
ascribed
to
examinations
such
as
those
which
come
from
the
state,
record-keeping,
everything
else.
and
the
--
the
defendant's
brief
on
--
defendant's
brief
admits
this
on
page
16
of
defendant's
brief.
it
says,
state
of
new
york
admits
that
the
--
the
(inaudible)
take
an
overwhelming
majority
of
tests.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
on
page
16
--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
--
of
main
brief,
(inaudible)
brief
of
the
state
of
new
york.
so,
under
the
bottom
of
the
page,
the
overwhelming
the
majority
of
tests
given
on
public
and
non-public
schools
alike
are
formulated,
administered,
and
created
by
teachers.
these
are
the
tests
which
take
care
of
two-thirds
of
the
whole
cost.
eliminate
that
and
you
have
an
amount
which
is
considered
to
be
substantially
less
than
the
amount
which
is
given
per
student.
but
even
that
is
not
relevant
because
the
state
takes
a
position
that
is
irrelevant
how
much
money
is
spent
for
these
mandated
services.
the
amount
is
given
per
pupil
and
not
on
the
basis
of
what
the
cost
is.
these
cost
analysis
were
not
applied
by
law.
they
were
made
in
litem
for
the
purpose
of
preparing
for
this
--
for
this
case
after
we
brought
the
suit.
and
that
--
and
the
--
the
stake
--
states
in
this
interrogatory,
it
was
a
part
of
interrogatory.
it
does
not
ask
what
the
money
is
for.
it
doesn't
require
any
reporting.
and
it
takes
a
position
that
the
amount
is
fixed
by
law
and
this
is
the
amount
which
is
unchangeable
whether
the
costs
go
up
or
go
down.
now,
there's
another
point
which
i'd
like
to
call
the
court's
attention.
i
think
ms.
coon
is
not
correct
in
stating
that
this
money
is
used
to
reimburse
for
expenditures
already
made.
the
law
was
passed
in
1970
to
take
effect
the
following
year.
and
during
each
year,
the
school
gets
per
pupil
according
to
the
amount
of
students
in
that
--
during
that
current
year.
the
first
year,
the
school
is
allowed
to
choose,
the
months
of
september,
october,
november,
which
month
it
will
take
to
measure
the
number
of
students
to
test.
and
for
that
year,
that
is
a
number
taken
for
$28
or
$45.
thereafter,
the
year
before
the
current
year
is
used
as
a
base
year.
but
the
payment
is
not
made
for
the
base
year.
the
--
they've
already
been
paid
for
the
base
year.
the
payment
is
made
for
the
current
year
and
that's
a
fact.
that
in
the
event
that
there
is
a
difference
between
the
student
enrollment
during
the
current
year,
or
the
base
year,
an
adjustment
is
made
accordingly.
moreover,
the
act
provides
that
the
payment
is
to
be
made
in
two
portions.one
is
payable
january
15th
and
the
other
is
paid
april
15th
for
the
current
year.
now
april
15th
is
two-and-a-half
months
before
the
end
of
the
school
year.
there
is
nothing
in
the
act
or
in
its
administration
which
prevents
a
school
teacher
or
school
principal,
or
superintendent
of
the
school
of
the
religious
schools
saying
to
the
teachers,
“we're
short
of
money
for
our
religious
teaching.
we're
short
of
money
for
our
religious
worship.
we've
got
to
carve
out
in-class
tests.”
no
more
class
testing.
use
all
that
money
for
the
two-and-a-half
months.
we're
getting
it
now.
use
all
that
money
to
pay
for
catechism,
to
pay
for
religious
worship.
according
to
the
state
of
new
york,
that
is
perfectly
permissible.
there
are
no
strings
attached
to
this
money,
no
reporting,
no
auditing,
only
the
--
only
auditing
required
is
to
establish
how
many
students
there
are
during
the
year.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
your
honor
is
entirely
correct.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
that's
exactly
what
the
point
is.
this
is
what
the
court
said
in
lemon.
it's
in
the
inside
of
the
dilemma.
either
you
give
money
which
can
be
used
for
religious
purposes
which
the
court
has
said
is
unconstitutional,
in
which
case
you
have
the
(inaudible)
of
financing
religious
instruction,
or
you
audit
and
you
supervise
as
they
try
to
do
in
lemon
which
is
this
(inaudible)
of
entanglement.
the
answer
is
of
course
that
the
law
is
unconstitutional,
but
that's
not
unusual.
that's
what
the
court
said
in
lemon
against
kurtzman.
that's
what
court
said
in
tilton
against
richardson.
in
tilton
against
richardson,
the
court
report
said,
an
unrestricted
grant
of
money,
which
is
partly
used
to
build
a
building,
which
after
20
years
may
be
used
to
hold
religious
classes,
that's
unconstitutional.
you
cannot
have
a
“no
strings
attached”
grant
of
money
to
a
religious
school.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
the
question
here
is
not
that
case,
your
honor.
(voice
overlap)
mr.
leo
pfeffer
bad
case?
mr.
leo
pfeffer
oh
bad
faith.
not
according
to
--
i'm
sorry.
not
according
to
the
interpretation
which
the
state
has
given
up
its
law
the
(voice
overlap)
mr.
leo
pfeffer
this
is
what
--
this
is
what
the
state
is
doing.
this
is
what
the
state
is
doing.
the
state
gave
this
money.
this
--
your
honor,
the
state
gives
money
before
it
made
this
cost,
selective
cost
analysis.
for
a
whole
year
it
gave
it
to
them.
it
has
not
a
question
--
what
are
you
doing
with
the
money?
the
money
was
given.
they'd
used
the
money
for
whatever,
at
will.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
not
according
to
--
now
look,
the
only
statutory
requirement
is
going
to
state
of
new
york,
the
only
statutory
requirements.
this
is
in
--
your
response
to
the
interrogatories.
mr.
justice
blackmun
asked
whether
this,
the
new
york
courts
have
interpreted
this?
but
new
york
courts
haven't,
because
they
can't.
new
york
is
the
one
state
of
the
union
which
doesn't
have
a
lot
taxpayer
suits.
we've
tried
taxpayer
suits.
we've
been
thrown
out
of
court.
in
one
state
in
the
union
we
can't
get
into
the
court.
so,
the
only
court
we
can
get
into
and
get
into
because
(inaudible)
is
a
federal
court.
but
new
york
has
not,
according
to
the
defense,
when
we
sued
in
the
state
of
new
york,
has
not
interpreted
this
law,
as
requiring
anything.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
the
attorney
general
is
defending
this
court.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
i
don't
think
he
can
because
the
according
to
the
state's
interpretation,
they're
not
required
to.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
thank
you.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
honors
please,
the
complaint
in
this
action,
challenges
the
law,
add
on
its
face
and
as
construed
and
applied.
i've
devoted
myself
up
till
now,
to
the
law
as
applied.
and
i've
have
pointed
out
that
the
law
as
applied
does
not
require
the
schools
to
in
anyway
account
for
the
money
received.
this
is
substantiated
and
it
is
established
by
the
interrogatories
was
submitted
to
the
state
and
their
response
to
it
on
the
appendix
pages
87a
and
88a
in
which
the
state
says
the
qualifying
schools
are
not
required
to
submit
the
reports
and
copy
for
the
moneys
received
and
how
they
are
expended.
also,
that
means,
it's
a
free
--
they
have
a
freehand
on
it,
no
strings
attached.
also,
i
want
to
call
to
the
court's
attention
to
the
fact
that
as
applied
and
this
is
--
comes
from
the
second
of
the
in
litem
cost
analysis
made
by
the
state
after
the
suit
was
started,
that
in
two
typical
schools
which
they
selected,
the
catholic
central
high
school
and
the
north
shore
hebrew
academy
and
i
point
this
out,
i
get
these
references
on
page
one
in
my
brief.
the
schools
--
the
first
school
received
$77,878
under
the
law.
taking
in
account
everything
other
than
teachers'
examinations,
that
means
this
region's
examination
of
pupil
evaluation
tests,
record-keeping,
health-keeping,
everything
conceivable
under
the
act
which
is
mandated,
which
is
not
mandated
and
this
includes
indirect
costs
and
so-called
kind
and
benefit
cost
which
these
teachers
give
as
in
--
in
kind
taking
them
all.
according
to
the
state's
own
cost
analysis,
the
sum
total
of
all
these,
the
most
liberally
interpreted
mandated
service
is
$24,674
which
is
less
than
one-third
of
the
amount
received
under
the
statute.
the
only
way
you
can
justify
this
statute
is
the
other
two-thirds
of
it,
is
if
teachers
examination,
the
kind
of
examination
which
a
teacher
give
in
every
school,
oral
or
written,
daily
quizzes,
weekly
quizzes
are
included.
you
get
two-thirds
of
sum
total
is
set.
the
same
is
true
with
the
second,
also
in
page
20.
the
second
typical
school,
the
north
shore
hebrew
academy,
they
receive
for
$5,400
mr.
leo
pfeffer
page
20
of
my
brief.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
yes,
that
gets
the
page
references
to
the
--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
yeah.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
page
20
--
it's
on
exhibit
d
and
exhibit
g,
$5400
as
north
shore
academy
received
under
the
statute.
its
total
cost
for
other
than
in-school
teachers'
testing,
is
$1776
again
less
than
one-third.
so
that
the
answer
to
the
question
which
was
just
to
justice
blackmun.
if
this
statute
were
interpreted
narrowly
to
limit
it
only
to
these,
to
exclude
teacher's
test
and
quizzes.
the
guts
of
the
statute
will
be
out.
two-thirds
of
the
amount
would
be
destroyed.
now
there's
no
question
that's
not
worth
an
answer.
now,
but
assume
–
assume
the
statute
is
what
is
says
to
this.
i
will
now,
at
this
point,
accept
the
statute
at
face
value
and
accept
that
teachers'
examinations
is
a
kind
of
teaching,
a
kind
of
examinations
which
are
done
every
day
on
schools
take
up
two-thirds
of
the
time.
that
that
is
what
is
properly
within
the
statute.
it's
our
opinion
that
this
statute
is
unconstitutional
on
its
face
for
a
variety
of
reasons.
it's
indistinguishable
from
lemon
against
kurtzman.
ms.
coon
has
responded
to
a
question
put
by
one
member
of
the
court
as
to
whether
teaching
itself
is
not
mandated,
which
was
involved
in
lemon
against
kurtzman,
teaching,
teaching
of
the
secular
subjects.
her
actual
--
i
was
unable
to
quite
understand.
she
said
it's
not
mandated
because
the
school
voluntarily
establishes
itself
to
teach.
if
it
didn't
voluntarily
establish
itself
to
teach,
it
wouldn't
be
required
to
teach.
but
that's
equally
true
about
these
reporting.
if
a
school,
the
private
school
did
not
voluntarily
undertake
to
teach,
they
wouldn't
to
have
to
or
submit
reports
of
any
kind.
it's
their
--
the
statute
in
new
york
as
in
pennsylvania,
hasn't
ruled
that.
it
requires
a
number
of
things.
it
requires
that
you
teach
certain
nine
or
eight
or
nine
basic
courses
which
was
involved
in
lemon
against
kurtzman
and
dicenso
against
robinson.
it
also
requires
that
you'll
keep
records
and
you
report
them.
i
can
see
no
distinction
between
them.
if
one
is
unconstitutional,
i
can't
see
how
the
other
is
--
is
constitutional.
moreover,
keeping
records,
and
testing
is
not
the
only
thing
required
of
these
schools
by
law.
they're
required
to
be
safe,
they're
required
to
be
sanitary,
they're
required
to
be
well
lit,
they're
required
be
in
every
way
respected
–
acceptable.
otherwise,
they're
violating
the
law.
as
ms.
coon
suggests,
that
because
the
state
requires
that
schools
be
safe
and
sanitary
and
lit
and
heated,
that
the
state
can
constitutionally,
on
the
statute
of
clause
pay
for
the
fuel
bills,
pay
for
the
lighting
bills,
repair
the
buildings,
the
church
buildings
--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
--
they're
both
happening.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
i
would
say
that's
constitutional
provided,
mr.
chief
justice,
provided
the
schools
were
account
--
were
required
to
account
that
they
did
that
particular
thing.
that
they
used
the
money
for
that
purpose,
for
the
inoculations,
but
this
not
required
here.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
no.
that
would
not
be
entanglement.
this
is
what,
the
difference
between
this
case
and
everson
--
and
--
and
how,
there
is
no
religious
aspect
to
an
inoculation.
you
--
that
inoculation
doesn't
but
as
the
court
pointed
out
in
lemon
against
kurtzman,
there
was
only
a
world
of
a
difference
in
teaching.
a
teacher
can't
if
this
is
from
the
lemon,
a
teacher
can
and
while
he
may
not,
some
may,
some
may
not,
may
use
the
teaching
for
the
purpose
of
inducting
any
religion.
and
this
is
exactly
equally
respected
testing.
if
you
include
in-class
testing,
and
i
have
put
forth
in
my
brief
examples
of
testing
in
respect
to
the
most
valued
three
subjects
of
mathematics.
i've
given
examples
of
actually
types
of
(inaudible)
used
and
proposed
in
which
you're
fully
impregnated
with
religious
values.
now,
i
don't
say
that
the
school
--
any
of
the
schools
in
new
york
use
those
tests.
i
don't
know
whether
they
do
it
or
they
don't
but
that's
not
important.
the
point
that
--
the
court
pointed
out
in
lemon,
that
the
point
is
that
only
to
make
sure
as
a
must
in
order
to
avoid
financing
religion
to
make
sure
that
it
doesn't
do
it,
this
state
has
an
obligation
to
maintain
a
continuing
surveillance.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
the
--
the
entanglement
would
be
limited
to
--
not
to
examining
what's
taught,
to
limit
it
just
to
a
doctor's
certificate.
yes,
we
inoculate
50
students
here
and
we
have
to
pay
for
$250.
there
are
no
entanglements
there.
that's
not
entanglement.
that's
not
the
surveillances
of
--
of
going
over
the
test.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
in
this
case?
mr.
leo
pfeffer
well,
i
would
say
that
even
if
they
did,
i
don't
believe
that
would
be
unconstitutional
provided,
provided
there
was
auditing
to
show
that
the
money
was
used
for
tha
purpose.
but
that's
--
that's
just
the
--
you
don't
reach
real
entanglements
surveillance.
all
you
get
is
a
--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
well,
(voice
overlap)
i
think
will
be
such
a
--
a
limited
entanglement.
i
don't
think
it'll
excessive
entanglement.
it
doesn't
get
into
that
guts
of
what
the
school
is
for.
a
school
isn't
establishing
(voice
overlap)
an
inoculation
to
teach.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
yes.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
i
don't
--
i
don't
think
that
will
be
unconstitutional
provided,
i
think
that
amount
of
entanglement
in
a
case
of
health
it
would
not
be
an
excessive
entanglement.
but
we're
dealing
with
--
we're
dealing
with
testing
which
is
done
in
the
classroom.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
oh,
that
would
be
difficult
thing
if
it
is
because
a
christian
science
couldn't
accept
it,
because
if
it
couldn't,
it
wouldn't
be
a
(voice
overlap)
mr.
leo
pfeffer
then
i
think
it
would
be
unconstitutional.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
because
there,
giving
the
money
would
be
there
for
use
for
an
–
an
--
either
unlawfully
of
an
unconstitutional
purpose.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
oh,
we'll
say
it's
--
or
is
the
christian
science
school
accepted
it
and
use
for
--
for
inoculations?
oh
that
will
be
all
right.
that
will
be
all
right.
i
think
so.
now,
the
point
is,
i
think
it
is
completely
unrealistic.
i
think
it's
just
as
a
fantasy
world
to
seek
to
the
divorce
testing,
day
by
day
testing,
examinations
written
on
a
front
page.
from
the
days
of
plato,
those
testings
have
been
the
basic
way
of
teaching,
the
major
way
of
teaching
religion
as
a
catechism.
that's
traditionally,
what
is
a
catechism?
it's
a
form
of
teaching
by
testing.
the
teacher
asks
questions,
the
student
answers.
if
a
student
answers
correctly
he's
learning
his
lesson.
if
he's
somehow
stucky,
he
studies
some
more.
every
student
knows
that
in
order
to
pass
his
course,
he
has
to
pass
examinations.
how
do
you
pass
examinations?
you
give
the
teacher
what
the
teacher
wants,
how?
now,
you
take
the
two
schools
here,
the
catholic
academy
and
the
north
--
the
hebrew
academy
and
the
catholic
school.
i
am
certain,
that
a
student
in
a
catholic
central
high
school
would
not
answer
a
question
on
history
on
the
reformation
the
way
the
same
question
would
be
answered
by
a
student
in
lutheran
high
school.
or
take
a
question
on
the
origins
of
christianity.
i
am
sure
that
a
student
in
the
north
shore
hebrew
academy
would
not,
if
he
wants
to
pass
the
course,
answer
that
question
the
same
way
that
a
student
in
the
catholic
central
school
will
do.
teaching
is
two
ways.
one
way,
and
the
least
effective
way,
is
for
this
teacher
to
stand
in
front
and
lecture
and
lecture.
and
then
send
the
students
home.
a
most
effective
way
is
for
the
teacher
to
get
it
from
the
students.
that's
way
it's
done.
and
the
state
says,
it
applies
to
everyday
teaching,
written,
and
art.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
i
know
of
no
such
case,
under
oath.
i
don't
think
it
applies
here
because
these
are
elementary
schools.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
from
grade
one
to
six.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
but
i
don't
know
of
any
such
thing.
i
don't
know
--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
well
the
--
the
--
my
answer
to
that
would
be,
that
the
rotc
is
generally
as
far
as
i
know
up
until
now,
is
at
college
level,
and
in
tilton
versus
richardson,
this
court
held
that
there
are
more
liberal
rules
with
respect
to
--
at
the
college
level
than
expect
the
elementary
and
high
school
level.
so
that,
i
don't
think
it
would
necessarily
be
the
same
answer.
i
would
have
reservations
on
the
elementary
and
secondary
sides
and
level.
it
would
certainly
have
reservations
on
it.
now,
in
lemon,
this
court
said
that,
in
lemon
and
dicenso
that
the
state
of
rhode
island
and
the
state
of
pennsylvania
were
obligated
under
the
constitution,
as
well
as
in
the
statute
to
see
to
it
that
the
money
given
to
the
teachers
was
used
only
for
secular
teaching.
that
it
couldn't
have
given
the
money
and
say,
use
it
for
secular
teaching
but
make
no
examination,
no
verification
whether
it's
been
used
as
a
purpose.
and
then
the
courts
went
and
said,
well
that
very
verification
--
you
see,
the
answer
to
mr.
justice
rehnquist's
questions,
that
very
auditing
--
that
very
surveillance,
that
very
required
constitutionally
and
statutory
requirement,
assurance
that
it
is
not
used
for
sectarian
instruction,
or
religious
worship,
that
involve,
that
surveillance
which
from
walz
through
lemon,
the
court
said
is
forbidden
by
the
establishment
clause.
yes,
it
is
true
that
--
that
if
--
if
there
were
no
audits
here
as
there
isn't,
we
call
any
stuff
constitutional
because
it
is
financing,
subsidizing
religious
education
and
if
there
is
some
audits
if
there
is
surveillance
and
there
is
policing,
we
say
it's
unconstitutional
because
it
involves
entanglement.
but
that's
not
our
dilemma.
that's
a
dilemma
of
the
establishment
clause.
that's
a
dilemma
of
a
history
of
over
a
150,
175
years
where
state
after
state,
court
after
court,
constitution
after
constitution
said
you
cannot
do
what
you're
trying
to
do
here.
you
cannot
take
tax-raised
funds
and
use
it
to
pay
part
of
the
upgraded
course
whether
it's
required
by
law
or
not
required
law
of
church
schools.
this
is
what
it's
all
about
is
what
the
establishment
clause
says
and
this
what
the
court
said
in
yoder.
that
long
before
there
was
a
public
school
system,
there
were
the
a
religion
clauses
and
that's
the
policies,
the
constitutional
interests
which
were
set
forth
in
the
religion
clause,
as
to
date,
our
educational
system
--
our
educational
system
had
to
shape
itself
to
the
establishment
in
the
free
exercise
clause,
not
the
establishment
of
free
exercise
clause
to
shape
themselves
and
fashion
themselves
to
the
educational
interest.
this
is
what
this
case
is
about.
this
--
this
case
says,
the
court
below
says,
you
cannot
take
an
import
element
of
the
budget
of
a
church
school
in
order
for
you
to
operate.
you
cannot
take
it
off
the
voluntary
contribution
of
those
who
adhere
to
and
make
an
--
an
obligation
of
every
taxpayer.
that's
a
violation
of
what,
the
establishment
clause
of
a
constitution.
your
honors,
thank
you
very
much.
