ms.
coon,
you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
how
does
the
state
audit
that?
how
does
the
state
know
whether
the
tests
are
executed?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
reports
on
each
individual
pupil?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
was
that
stipulated?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
from
your
response
to
the
one
of
the
other,
earlier
questions,
it
would
seem
to
me
at
least,
that
new
york
state
is
unique
in
not
having
any
standards,
computations
for
the
teachers.
some
of
the
states,
at
least,
have
the
same
requirements
applied
to
private
and
parochial
church
schools
as
for
public
schools
and
are
--
are
you
sure
that
new
york
doesn't
require
those
same
standards
for
the
teachers
in
a
--
in
a
church
school?
that
as
a
college
degree,
if
a
college
degree
is
required
to
teach
eighth
grade
or
junior
high
school
in
public
schools,
are
you
telling
us
that
that
is
not
required?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
i
understand
mr.
chandler
that
you'll
reserve
your
time
for
rebuttal.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
mr.
pfeffer.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
do
you
mean
it
could
avoid
giving
the
tests
entirely?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
it
still
get
the
$28
and
the
$45
if
they
didn't.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
where
are
you
now?

of
the
main
brief?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
independent
of
the
first
amendment
religion
clauses
mr.
pfeffer,
couldn't
the
states,
if
they
failed
to
carry
out
the
contract
of
--
in
relation
to
the
grant
or
the
--
the
statutory
purpose
can
the
state
recover
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
could
the
attorney
general
bring
a
suit
in
the
state
courts?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
could
he
bring
a
suit
in
the
state
courts
asserting
that
the
school,
a
particular
school,
or
a
whole
group
of
them
failed
to
comply
with
the
purposes
of
the
--
the
grant,
and
therefore
seek
reimbursement.
(voice
overlap)
it
doesn't
mean
that
he
would
do
it.
so,
could
he
do
it
legally?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
will
resume
there
right
after
lunch,
mr.
pfeffer.
chief
justice
warren
e.

burger
let
me
clear
that
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
let
me
clear
that
step
further
mr.
pfeffer.
suppose
the
state
required
an
annual
or
semi-annual
examination,
x-rays,
or
chest
x-rays
and
annual
inoculations
for
polio.
it
gave
private
schools
the
choice
of
either
having
the
state
supply
the
service,
a
mobile
medical
unit
or
to
let
the
private
schools
engage
the
services
themselves
with
their
own
physicians
and
pay
them
$5
a
head
or
$10
a
head.
what
would
you
say
about
that?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
only
law
they'd
be
violating
would
be
the
christian
science
tenet.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
pfeffer,
if
you
know
has
the
rotc
program
ever
been
tested
in
any
of
the
federal
courts
or
state
courts?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
yes.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
it's
--
chief

that
--
that
still
gives
us
some
--
it
has
entanglement
and
gives
us
some
aid
to
church-operated
institution
does
it
not?
