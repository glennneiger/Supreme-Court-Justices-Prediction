is
it
possible
for
the
new
york
statute
to
have
been
constituted
more
narrowly
so
as
to,
as
not
to
include
what
you
have
just
told
me
is
included?
justice
potter
stewart
has
--
has
this
statute
ever
been
constituted
by
the
state
courts?
justice
potter
stewart
but
they
do
have
--
the
statewide
tests
are
given
to
the
public
schools.
justice
potter
stewart
how
much
audit
is
done
of
the
amount?
justice
potter
stewart
but
there's
no
continuing
audit?
justice
potter
stewart
the
entanglement
is
in
actually
in
the
requiring
the
test
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
supervision
of
--
of
the
performance?
justice
potter
stewart
do
--
do
the
teachers
just
--
following
up
my
brother
douglas'
question,
do
the
teachers
in
private
parochial
schools
have
to
--
have
to
be
--
have
to
meet
certain
standards
of
imposed
by
the
states
or
do
they
have
to
be
at
the
state
of
new
york
or
do
they
have
to
be
certificated
in
any
way?
justice
potter
stewart
but
there's
no
requirement
as
to
the
educational
and
professional
qualifications
of
the
teachers
in
these
schools?
justice
potter
stewart
they
could
be
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
the
teachers
insofar
as
the
state
knows
to
be
wholly
illiterate
for
instance?
justice
potter
stewart
there'd
--
they'd
be
quite
extraordinary
teachers.
i
agree
with
you.
justice
potter
stewart
but
there
are
no
standards
for
the
teachers
are
they?
as
there
are
the
public
schools?

justice

i
--
i
don't
think
that's
so
unusual,
i
through
people
on
our
family,
i
know
a
good
many
of
them
are
college
graduates
who
had
jobs
in
private
schools,
but
who
couldn't
get
jobs
in
public
schools
because
they
hadn't
had
the
necessary
courses
in
education.
that's
not
too
unusual.
justice
potter
stewart
so
the
best
private
schools
in
the
country
have
teachers
who
could
not
get
jobs
in
public
schools.
justice
potter
stewart
because
they
haven't
had
the
necessary
courses
in
--
in
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
education.
justice
potter
stewart
i
notice
that,
but
don't
you
think
that
new
york
would
be
in
bad
faith?
i
mean
the
schools
would
be
in
bad
faith
if
they
did
what
you
suggest?
let's
take
the
money
but
don't
use
for
what
it's
supposed
to
pay
for?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i
did
not
--
i
just
asked
you
a
question.
would
it
be
in
bad
faith
or
not?
justice
potter
stewart
bad
faith.
justice
potter
stewart
you
mean
that
new
york
can
say,
“here
is
$28
do
with
it
what
you
want
to
do
and
--
justice
potter
stewart
that
would
be
entanglement,
wouldn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
well
that
would
be
true
in
the
inoculation
case
because
the
school
might
take
the
money
and
use
it
for
religious
teaching,
(voice

and
--
and
therefore
the
state
would
to
be
assured
that
the
school
had
not
done
that
and
that
would
entangle
the
state
with
the
school,
would
it
not?

is
