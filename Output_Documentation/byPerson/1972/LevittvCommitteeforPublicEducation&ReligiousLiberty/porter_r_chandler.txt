mr.

r.
chandler
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
porter
r.
chandler
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
porter
r.
chandler
i
appear
on
behalf
of
a
group
of
catholic
schools
who
admitted
and
intervened
and
ours
below.
there's
a
group
of
jewish
schools
also
who
intervened
and
who
appealed,
who
filed
a
brief
here.
they're
not
represented
in
an
oral
argument
but
our
positions
are
similar.
mr.
porter
r.
chandler
(voice
overlap)
mr.
porter
r.
chandler
what?
mr.
porter
r.
chandler
yes,
yes
i
believe
so.
because
it
--
it
names
of
two
academies
at
the
bottom
i
think.
what
about
the
other
one?
mr.
porter
r.
chandler
yes,
sir.
mr.
porter
r.
chandler
these
do
not,
no.
but
they
are
affiliated
with
the
catholic
church.
we
make
no
bones
about
it.
there's
one
high
school
and
two
--
and
two
--
two
elementary
schools.
mr.
porter
r.
chandler
cathedral
academy
in
albany
has
--
has
an
enrollment
of
approximately
500
students.
approximately
230
of
them
are
black.
approximately
225
of
them
are
non-catholic.
mr.
porter
r.
chandler
there
is
no
--
there
is
no
such
requirement.
as
i've
said,
there
is
no
such
requirement.
mr.
porter
r.
chandler
i
believe
in
one
or
two
of
them,
courses
in
religion
are
required.
a
--
a
challenge
of
worship
is
not
the
--
the
answers
to
our
interrogatories.
spell
that
out
--
they
--
they
spell
that
out,
i
think.
we
are
here
in
this
that
this
statute
has
been
enacted.
a
unique
statute
in
reliance
on
the
language
of
this
court
in
the
allen
case,
if
--
this
court
there
said,
if
the
state
must
satisfy
its
interest
in
secular
education
through
the
instrument
of
private
schools,
it
has
a
proper
interest
in
the
manner
in
which
those
schools
perform
their
secular
education
function.
that
is
what
we
say
this
act
was
designed
to
do.
it's
already
been
brought
out,
but
it
should
be
emphasized
again
that
public
and
private
schools
in
the
state
of
new
york
are
part
of
one
system,
and
subject
to
one
set
of
control.
they've
been
under
the
university
in
the
state
of
new
york
since
1784.
they've
been
required
to
be
compulsory
examined,
tested,
and
inspected
since
i
think
1852.
take
the
case
of
a
child
who
goes
to
a
catholic
high
school.
he
has
to
take
courses
prescribed
by
the
regents,
the
state
of
new
york,
his
attendance
records
are
kept.
he
takes
examinations,
and
when
he
takes
them,
the
same
of
so-called,
regents'
examinations,
they're
the
same
examinations
that
are
taught,
that
are
given
down
the
street
in
george
washington
high
school
and
if
he
passes
them,
he
gets
a
diploma.
and
who
does
he
get
the
diploma
from?
he
gets
the
same
diploma
as
his
friend
down
the
street.
he
gets
the
diploma
signed,
not
by
the
bishop,
not
by
the
pastor,
but
by
the
commissioner
of
education
of
the
state
of
new
york.
the
degree
of
control
is
illustrated
by
one
regulation
which
is,
that
if
a
school,
public
or
private
wants
to
give
a
course
where
there
is
not,
an
already
an
approved
syllabus,
permission
from
the
state
of
education
department
must
be
had
before
that
course
is
to
be
taught.
mr.
pfeffer's
arguments
and
his
bookkeeping
depend
on
one
fundamental
fallacy.
he
overlooks
the
fact
that
this
is
a
reimbursement
statute.
this
talk
about,
the
money
goes
out,
they
can
use
it
for
whatever
they
like,
overlooks
the
fact
that
chronologically,
what
has
happened
is
this.
the
school
sends
in
a
form
asking
a
large
number
of
questions
and
testing
whole,
do
you
comply
with
this
and
this
section
of
the
law?
what
courses
do
you
give
in
fire
protection?
what
courses
do
you
give
and
so
on
and
so
on.
before
you're
eligible
to
--
you
have
to
fill
that
out
in
order
to
get
the
money.
and
they
say
that
you'll
have
to
certify
that
you
have
conducted
the
testing
requirements
that
you
have
had
to
attend
--
kept
attendance
requirements
and
done
all
the
other
things
required
for
the
mandated
services.
the
school
will
have
done
all
that
out
of
its
own
pocket.
it
will
be
out
that
much
money.
and
then
later
on,
it
gets
a
reimbursement.
now,
that
reimbursement
--
mr.
porter
r.
chandler
i
--
your
honor,
is
quite
correct.
i
omitted
that
word.
it's
a
partial
reimbursement,
and
not
--
mr.
porter
r.
chandler
or
--
or
what?
mr.
porter
r.
chandler
there's
no
indication
that
--
mr.
porter
r.
chandler
yes.
there
--
there
are
studies
in
--
in
the
book
(voice
overlap)
mr.
porter
r.
chandler
yes
sir.
mr.
porter
r.
chandler
no,
it
is
not.
mr.
porter
r.
chandler
well,
it's
--
it's
a
partial
reimbursement
because
it's
less
than
the
cost
that
the
school
undertook.
mr.
porter
r.
chandler
a
contribution
toward
that
but
the
point
that
i
make
is,
the
school,
whatever
it
is,
the
school
is
--
out
of
the
money
it
has
performed
the
services.
it
gets
back
a
partial,
not
larger,
a
partial
reimbursement.
that
partial
reimbursement
of
course
becomes
its
own
money.
let
me
go
back
to
an
analogy.
what
about
this
parent
in
the
everson
bus
case?
he
paid
out
of
his
own
pockets
for
a
bus
fair.
he
later
got
it
back.
was
that
money
segregated
or
tainted
or
marked
by
sectarian
influence?
no,
he
got
it
back,
he
could
use
it
to
put
into
play.
he
could
use
it
to
go
to
the
races.
it
was
a
reimbursement
for
a
legitimate
expense.
so,
with
all
respect,
i
say
that
this
talk
about
audits
is
completely
beside
the
point.
the
point
is
that
the
school
is
required
to
perform
a
large
number,
an
appalling
number
of
administrative
services
for
the
state.
i
want
to
cite
an
illustration.
i
just
happened
to
notice
that
the
records
of
attendance
and
other
basic
data
in
connection
with
these
--
these
applications
are
required
by
the
state
to
be
maintained,
opened
to
inspection
of
the
schools'
files
for
at
least
50
years.
did
the
parent
in
the
textbook
case
who
was
relieved
of
the
cost
of
buying
textbooks?
did
he
get
sectarian
--
was
it
sectarian
money?
was
it
sectarian
reimbursement?
no,
the
point
i'm
making
is,
that
if
this
is
a
reimbursement,
where
funds
are
already
expended,
it's
completely
immaterial
where
the
money
goes.
the
partial
reimbursement
was
deliberately
fixed
by
law
in
the
judgment
of
the
legislature
which
should
be
conclusive.
and
it
was
fixed
in
such
a
way
that
there
would
be
no
overage.
the
cost
studies
made
after
the
suit
was
brought,
all
bear
that
out.
let
me
give
you
just
one
little
illustration
from
one
of
the
exhibits.
in
mode
two,
they
studied
how
much
it
costs
the
schools
to
perform
the
mandated
services.
they
took
a
public
high
school
and
a
catholic
high
school
and
a
public
elementary
school
and
a
catholic
elementary
school.
they
applied
the
same
bookkeeping
tests
to
both
of
them
to
see
how
much
it
costs.
holy
trinity
high
school
in
hicksville
for
doing
the
state's
bookkeeping
for
it,
cost
that
school
$232.90
per
pupil,
and
they
got
back
$45.
hicksville
high
school
at
the
same
time,
same
town,
it
cost
them
$361.72,
one-third
more.
corpus
christi
elementary
school
and
mineola
catholic,
it
cost
them
$77.56
to
do
the
state's
work
for
it.
they
got
back
$27.
willis
avenue
elementary
public
school
across
the
street,
cost
them
$474.12
to
do
the
same
services.
and
so,
as
to
all
the
other
--
mr.
porter
r.
chandler
well,
variation?
well
--
i
--
i
--
apparently
because
the
catholic
schools
are
--
pinch
their
pennies
a
bit
tighter
while
the
mineola
high
school
--
mr.
porter
r.
chandler
for
mineola
high
school
may
have
--
i
believe
that
was
a
new
school
with
not
too
large
an
enrollment
that
may
have
come
to
more.
that
--
but
let
me
take
others
from
the
same
study,
holy
family
elementary
in
hicksville
cost
them
$86,
got
back
$27.
the
dutch
lane
elementary
school,
it
cost
them
$198,
still
much
larger,
but
not
quite
as
large
as
the
--
as
the
mineola
figure.
so,
it
simply
shows
that
there
is
no
padding
and
no
excess
and
that
applying
the
same
bookkeeping
methods
fairly
to
both
public
and
private
schools
shows
or
demonstrates
the
fact
that
there
can
be
no
overage
and
no
excess.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
all
three
judges
in
the
trial
court
agreed
that
there
was
no
excess.
judge
palmieri
pointed
it
out
very
forcefully
in
his
dissent.
the
other
judges
said
that
if
you
take
out
of
account
teacher
exams,
then
there's
very
--
the
--
the
cost
or
--
then
the
reimbursement
might,
in
some
instances,
exceed
the
cost.
but
the
point
is
we
maintain
that
the
teacher
exam
should
not
be
taken
out.
they're
in
the
statute,
they
are
specifically
provided
for
in
a
regulation
which
my
opponent
has
not
even
cited
in
his
brief.
i
see
my
time
is
running
very
short
and
i
will
close,
your
honor,
with
one
further
thought.
we've
heard
something
about
dilemmas
today.
consider
this
dilemma.
the
state
has
a
right
to
have
parochial
schools
perform
effectively.
it
has
a
right
to
have
testing
and
examination
done,
not
for
the
purpose
of
educating
them,
but
for
the
purpose
of
seeing
how
well
they
are
being
educated.
if
it
costs
--
it
admittedly
costs
schools
a
lot
of
money
to
do
it.
if
relief
of
this
sort
is
not
allowed,
another
alternative,
if
it
once
comes
up,
may
i
just
finish
my
sentence.
a
core
of
state
inspectors,
if
it's
all
wrong
to
reimburse
a
school
for
doing
this
kind
of
work,
it's
obviously
all
right
to
send
the
core
of
inspectors
in
every
monday,
wednesday,
and
friday
to
keep
attendance
records,
to
give
examinations,
prior
to
the
teacher
from
the
room
for
the
moment
and
give
an
examination
and
do
all
the
bookkeeping
work.
that
would
require
quite
a
few
more
people
in
albany
and
would,
i
think,
result
in
entanglement
of
a
source
of
--
of
a
sort
that
has
hardly
been
conceived.
mr.
porter
r.
chandler
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
porter
r.
chandler
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
porter
r.
chandler
i
appear
on
behalf
of
a
group
of
catholic
schools
who
admitted
and

and
ours

there's
a
group
of
jewish
schools
also
who
intervened
and
who
appealed,
who
filed
a

here.
they're
not

an

our
positions
are

mr.

chandler
(voice

mr.

chandler
what?
mr.

yes,
yes
i
believe
so.
because

--
they

we
are

in
this

a

in

that
is
what
we
say
this

was
designed
to
do.
it's
already
been
brought
out,
but
it
should
be
emphasized
again
that
public
and
private
schools
in
the
state
of
new

are
part
of

and
subject
to

since

take
the
case
of
a
child
who
goes
to
a
catholic
high
school.
he
has
to
take
courses
prescribed
by
the
regents,
the

his

are
kept.
he
takes

and
when

the

of
so-called,

examinations,
they're
the
same
examinations
that
are

that
are
given
down
the
street
in
george
washington
high
school
and
if
he
passes
them,
he
gets
a
diploma.
and
who
does
he
get
the
diploma
from?
he
gets
the
same
diploma
as
his
friend
down
the
street.
he
gets
the
diploma
signed,
not
by
the
bishop,
not
by
the
pastor,
but
by
the
commissioner
of
education
of
the
state
of
new
york.
the
degree
of
control
is
illustrated
by
one
regulation
which
is,
that
if
a
school,
public
or
private
wants
to
give
a
course
where
there
is
not,
an
already
an
approved
syllabus,
permission
from
the
state
of
education
department
must
be
had
before
that
course
is
to
be
taught.
mr.
pfeffer's
arguments
and
his
bookkeeping
depend
on
one
fundamental
fallacy.
he
overlooks
the
fact
that
this
is
a
reimbursement
statute.
this
talk
about,
the
money
goes
out,
they
can
use
it
for
whatever
they
like,
overlooks
the
fact
that
chronologically,
what
has
happened
is
this.
the
school
sends
in
a
form
asking
a
large
number
of
questions
and
testing
whole,
do
you
comply
with
this
and
this

of
the
law?
what

do
you
give

what

do
you
give
and
so
on
and
so
on.
before
you're
eligible
to
--
you
have
to
fill
that
out
in
order
to
get
the
money.
and
they
say
that
you'll
have
to
certify
that
you
have
conducted
the
testing
requirements
that
you
have
had
to
attend
--
kept
attendance
requirements
and
done
all
the
other
things
required
for
the
mandated
services.
the
school
will
have
done
all
that
out
of
its
own
pocket.
it
will
be
out
that
much
money.
and
then
later
on,
it
gets
a
reimbursement.
now,
that
reimbursement
--
mr.
porter
r.
chandler
i
--
your
honor,
is
quite
correct.
i
omitted
that
word.
it's
a
partial

it's

that
i
make
is,
the
school,
whatever
it
is,
the
school
is
--
out
of
the
money
it
has
performed
the
services.
it
gets
back
a
partial,
not
larger,
a
partial
reimbursement.
that
partial
reimbursement
of
course
becomes
its
own
money.
let
me
go
back
to
an
analogy.
what
about
this
parent
in
the
everson
bus
case?
he
paid
out
of
his
own
pockets
for
a
bus
fair.
he
later
got
it
back.
was
that
money
segregated
or
tainted
or
marked
by
sectarian
influence?
no,
he
got
it
back,
he
could
use
it
to
put
into
play.
he
could
use
it
to
go
to
the
races.
it
was
a
reimbursement
for
a
legitimate
expense.
so,
with
all
respect,
i
say
that
this
talk
about
audits
is
completely
beside
the
point.
the
point
is
that
the
school
is
required
to
perform
a
large
number,
an
appalling
number
of
administrative
services
for
the
state.
i
want
to
cite
an
illustration.
i
just
happened
to
notice
that
the
records
of
attendance
and
other
basic
data
in
connection
with
these
--
these
applications
are
required
by
the
state
to
be
maintained,
opened
to
inspection
of
the
schools'
files
for
at
least
50
years.
did
the
parent
in
the
textbook
case
who
was
relieved
of
the
cost
of
buying
textbooks?
did
he
get
sectarian
--
was
it
sectarian
money?
was
it
sectarian
reimbursement?
no,
the
point
i'm
making
is,
that
if
this
is
a
reimbursement,
where
funds
are
already
expended,
it's
completely
immaterial
where
the
money
goes.
the
partial
reimbursement
was
deliberately
fixed
by
law
in
the
judgment
of
the
legislature
which
should
be
conclusive.
and
it
was
fixed
in
such
a
way
that
there
would
be
no
overage.
the
cost
studies
made
after
the
suit
was
brought,
all
bear
that
out.
let
me
give
you
just
one
little
illustration
from
one
of
the
exhibits.
in
mode
two,
they
studied
how
much
it
costs
the
schools
to
perform
the
mandated
services.
they
took
a
public
high
school
and
a
catholic
high
school
and
a
public
elementary
school
and
a
catholic
elementary
school.
they
applied
the
same
bookkeeping
tests
to
both
of
them
to
see
how
much
it
costs.
holy
trinity
high
school
in
hicksville
for
doing
the
state's
bookkeeping
for
it,
cost
that
school
$232.90
per
pupil,
and
they
got
back
$45.
hicksville
high
school
at
the
same
time,
same
town,
it
cost
them
$361.72,
one-third
more.
corpus
christi
elementary
school
and
mineola
catholic,
it
cost
them
$77.56
to
do
the
state's
work
for
it.
they
got
back
$27.
willis
avenue
elementary
public
school
across
the
street,
cost
them
$474.12
to
do
the
same
services.
and
so,
as
to
all
the
other
--
mr.
porter
r.
chandler
well,
variation?
well
--
i
--
i
--
apparently
because
the
catholic
schools
are
--
pinch
their
pennies
a
bit
tighter
while
the
mineola
high
school
--
mr.
porter
r.
chandler
for
mineola
high
school
may
have
--
i
believe
that
was
a
new
school
with
not
too
large
an
enrollment
that
may
have
come
to
more.
that
--
but
let
me
take
others
from
the
same
study,
holy
family
elementary
in
hicksville
cost
them
$86,
got
back
$27.
the
dutch
lane
elementary
school,
it
cost
them
$198,
still
much
larger,
but
not
quite
as
large
as
the
--
as
the
mineola
figure.
so,
it
simply
shows
that
there
is
no
padding
and
no
excess
and
that
applying
the
same
bookkeeping
methods
fairly
to
both
public
and
private
schools
shows
or
demonstrates
the
fact
that
there
can
be
no
overage
and
no
excess.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
all
three
judges
in
the
trial
court
agreed
that
there
was
no
excess.
judge
palmieri
pointed
it
out
very
forcefully
in
his
dissent.
the
other
judges
said
that
if
you
take
out
of
account
teacher
exams,
then
there's
very
--
the
--
the
cost
or
--
then
the
reimbursement
might,
in
some
instances,
exceed
the
cost.
but
the
point
is
we
maintain
that
the
teacher
exam
should
not
be
taken
out.
they're
in
the
statute,
they
are
specifically
provided
for
in
a
regulation
which
my
opponent
has
not
even
cited
in
his
brief.
i
see
my
time
is
running
very
short
and
i
will
close,
your
honor,
with
one
further
thought.
we've
heard
something
about
dilemmas
today.
consider
this
dilemma.
the
state
has
a
right
to
have
parochial
schools
perform
effectively.
it
has
a
right
to
have
testing
and
examination
done,
not
for
the
purpose
of
educating
them,
but
for
the
purpose
of
seeing
how
well
they
are
being
educated.
if
it
costs
--
it
admittedly
costs
schools
a
lot
of
money
to
do
it.
if
relief
of
this
sort
is
not
allowed,
another
alternative,
if
it
once
comes
up,
may
i
just
finish
my
sentence.
a
core
of
state
inspectors,
if
it's
all
wrong
to
reimburse
a
school
for
doing
this
kind
of
work,
it's
obviously
all
right
to
send
the
core
of
inspectors
in
every
monday,
wednesday,
and
friday
to
keep
attendance
records,
to
give
examinations,
prior
to
the
teacher
from
the
room
for
the
moment
and
give
an
examination
and
do
all
the
bookkeeping
work.
that
would
require
quite
a
few
more
people
in
albany
and
would,
i
think,
result
in
entanglement
of
a
source
of
--
of
a
sort
that
has
hardly
been
conceived.
