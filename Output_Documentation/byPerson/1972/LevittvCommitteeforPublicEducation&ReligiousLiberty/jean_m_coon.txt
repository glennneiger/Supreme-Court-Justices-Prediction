ms.
jean
m.
coon
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
statute
at
issue
on
this
appeal,
chapter
138
of
the
new
york
laws
of
1970,
provides
for
the
payment
by
the
state
to
non-public
schools
within
the
state,
specific
sums
of
money
as
partial
reimbursement
of
the
expenses
of
record-keeping,
testing,
and
reporting
incurred
by
the
non-public
schools
in
complying
with
requirements
of
state
law
and
regulation.
the
laws
and
regulations
referred
to
have
been
enacted
for
the
purposes
of
the
examination
and
inspection
of
the
non-public
schools
by
the
state.
the
examination
of
this
statute
to
determine
its
validity,
must
we
feel
be
made
in
the
perspective
of
the
total
historical
educational
picture
in
the
state
of
new
york.
from
the
creation
of
the
university
of
the
state
of
new
york
in
1787,
the
regents
of
that
university
and
subsequently
the
commissioner
of
education
as
its
administrative
arm
had
a
general
supervision
over
all
educational
institutions
in
the
state
of
new
york,
both
public
and
private.
all
private
educational
institutions
from
elementary
grades
through
colleges
receive
their
charges
from
the
board
of
regents.
the
state
education
law
gives
the
commissioner
of
education
the
power
to
examine
and
inspect
private
as
well
as
public
institutions
of
learning,
to
determine
whether
or
not
they
comply
with
the
compulsory
attendance
and
instructional
requirements
of
the
state
law.
the
state
education
law
not
only
requires
children
to
regularly
attend
some
school,
either
public
or
private,
but
sets
minimum
standards
of
education
including
course
content
which
must
be
met
by
the
schools
which
these
children
attend,
in
order
that
their
attendance
does
comply
with
the
compulsory
attendance
laws.
the
importance
of
this
supervisory
function
to
the
states
concerned,
relative
to
its
children's
education
was
recognized
by
the
framers
of
the
state
constitution
in
1894
when
in
adding
a
provision
prohibiting
aid
to
sectarian
schools,
they
specifically
accepted
expenditures
of
money
for
the
purposes
of
examination
and
inspection,
in
the
carrying
out
of
this
function
of
examination
and
inspection
and
general
supervision
over
the
education
provided
by
non-public
schools
in
the
state.
the
state
requires
the
schools
to
perform
certain
testing,
record-keeping,
and
reporting
services
to
the
state.
among
these
are
the
administration
of
tests,
including
regents'
examinations
which
are
statewide
tests
of
specific
subject
matter
achievement,
pupil
evaluation
program
tests
in
grade
six
and
nine,
and
other
general
statewide
evaluation
tests
also
used
in
public
schools.
and
in
addition,
the
regulations
of
the
commissioner
of
education
require
the
non-public
schools
to
conduct
a
continuing
program
of
individual
pupil
testing
in
all
grades
to
provide
an
adequate
basis
for
evaluating
pupil
achievement.
in
addition
to
the
testing
program,
the
non-public
schools
are
required
to
maintain
health
records,
records
of
marks,
attendance
records,
provide
information
under
the
basic
educational
data
system,
which
includes
statistical
information
as
to
students,
teachers,
curricula
offered,
physical
plans
and
so
forth,
and
of
secondary
schools,
additional
data
on
a
more
detailed
basis
than
in
the
basic
educational
data
system.
these
requirements
imposed
upon
non-public
schools
by
law
or
regulations
involve
considerable
addition
expense
to
the
schools
for
which,
immediately
prior
to
the
enactment
of
chapter
i38,
the
schools
were
not
compensated.
while
immediately
prior
to
the
enactment
of
the
statute,
the
schools
were
not
compensated,
the
state
has
had
a
long
history
of
providing
some
compensation
to
some
non-public
schools
in
recognition
of
the
cost
burden
imposed
by
the
state
in
assuring
that
the
requirements
of
the
compulsory
attendance
laws
are
being
met.
beginning
in
1892,
appropriations
remain
annually
to
so
called
academies
for
services
in
connection
with
the
compulsory
attendance
laws.
those
academies
included
sectarian
and
non-sectarian,
secondary
non-public
schools.
the
provision
for
such
compensation
was
retained
in
the
state's
education
law
until
1930,
but
even
after
repeal
in
that
year,
appropriations
continued
to
be
made
and
in
the
state's
local
assistance
appropriation
bills,
in
connection
with
the
attendance
requirements
of
academic
pupils.
only
in
the
years
between
1968
and
the
enactment
of
the
legislation
at
issue
here
for
no
payments
made
to
any
non-public
schools
for
these
purposes.
the
legislation
adopted
in
1970
therefore,
merely
reinstated
a
past
practice
of
compensating
non-public
schools
for
record-keeping
and
examination
services
required
by
the
state
updated
the
amount
paid
to
reflect
current
economic
conditions
and
made
the
base
of
payment
more
equitable
by
including
all
non-public
schools
at
all-state
imposed
examination
and
recordkeeping
requirements.
the
cost
analysis
studies
made
for
the
state
education
department,
in
which
there
are
exhibits
in
this
case,
exhibits
d
and
g
in
a
separate
folder
of
exhibits
submitted
to
the
court,
and
which
were
made
by
three
individuals
acting
independently
of
each
other,
demonstrate
that
the
payments
made
to
the
non-public
schools
are
justified
in
amount,
and
are
still
substantially
less
for
the
actual
cost
of
performance
of
the
services.
appellees
do
not
dispute
these
conclusions,
except
by
alleging
that
the
administration
of
test
is
a
part
of
the
teaching
function
of
the
non-public
schools
and
then
consequently
new
york
is
paying
the
schools
for
the
cost
of
education.
this
is
a
matter
of
perspective.
from
the
state's
point
of
view,
we
are
not
paying
the
schools
to
administer
tests
as
part
of
the
educational
program
of
the
schools,
but
rather
as
a
method
of
evaluating
the
achievement
of
the
schools
in
meeting
minimum
standards
of
education.
this
assumes
that
the
teaching
function
per
se
has
been
completed
prior
to
the
administration
of
a
test
as
a
measuring
device,
and
we
submit
that
is
the
more
reasonable
viewpoint
on
the
aspect
of
the
state's
payment
--
in
this
--
this
regard.
the
past
decisions
of
this
court
have
not
prohibited
all
payments
or
benefits
to
non-public
schools.
justice,
they
have
not
permitted
all
payments
or
benefits.
in
everson,
the
activities
which
were
described
as
prohibited
were
those
directed
to
the
aid
of
religion
as
such.
in
mcgowan
this
court
observed
that
the
establishment
cost
does
not
ban
state
or
federal
regulations
of
conduct
whose
effect
merely
happens
to
coincide
with
the
tenets
of
some
religions.
again
in
everson,
the
court
expressed
the
concept
of
neutrality,
stating
that
the
constitution
does
not
require
the
state
to
be
the
adversary
of
religion.
in
both
(inaudible)
and
mcgowan,
this
court
discussed
the
intent
and
effect
test
by
which
a
statute
is
measured
as
to
whether
it
has
a
secular
legislative
intent
and
a
primary
effect
which
neither
aids
nor
inhibits
religion.
in
walz
the
test
by
which
legislations
were
being
measured
was
expanded
to
include
an
evaluation
as
to
where
the
statute
of
issue
created
an
excessive
entanglement
between
church
and
state.
in
discussing
whether
or
not
the
new
york
statute
here
at
issue
meets
objections
under
each
of
these
tests,
we
must
bear
in
mind
the
observation
of
this
court's
opinion
in
lemon
that
the
line
between
permissible
and
impermissible
legislation
is
not
a
wall
but
rather
a
blurred,
indistinct
and
variable
barrier
depending
on
all
the
circumstances
of
a
particular
relationship.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
yes,
your
honor,
because
the
--
the
state
commissioner's
regulations
require
the
non-public
schools
to
have
a
continual
–
in-school
program
of
testing
of
pupils
to
measure
educational
achievement
and
that
the
testing
involved
here
includes
not
only
the
general
test
imposed
by
the
state
which
are
statewide
in
application
but
also
the
state's
examination
of
the
test
administered
in
the
schools
to
determine
whether
or
not
the
pupils
in
all
grades
are
meeting
levels
of
educational
achievement.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
that
was
included
in
the
cost
analysis
studies.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
they
require
reports
to
be
made
to
the
commission
of
education.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
on
--
on
the
results
of
testing,
yes,
your
honor.
it
was
--
it
was
not
by
name
necessarily
but
by
program
of
evaluating
the
tests
given
the
results
of
the
tests
on
how
the
pupils
are
measuring
up
in
terms
of
whether
or
not,
their
--
their
measurement
complies
with
the
general
standards
of
education
of
children
in
similar
grades
in
the
public
schools.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
it
would
be
possible
to
so
construe
it
and
that
might
raise
a
question
as
to
the
relationship
of
the
amount
paid.
there
was
a
--
there
was
a
cost
analysis
study
which
is
exhibit
g
which
referred
only
to
the
statewide
tests
and
comes
less
than
the
amount
paid
to
the
schools.
however,
that
it
should
also
be
noted
that
that
particular
cost
analysis
study,
while
it
related
only
to
statewide
tests,
do
not
include
the
other
record-keeping
functions
such
as
health
records
and
attendance
records
and
so
forth
which
were
included
in
the
other
studies
which
included
the
teacher
testing.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
no,
your
honor
it
has
not.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
it
is
conceivable,
your
honor.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
no,
your
honor
they
are
not.
they
are
--
ms.
jean
m.
coon
yes,
your
honor,
they
are.
they're
required
by
the
commission
--
commissioner's
regulations.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
i
would
assume
any
type
of
test
the
teacher
would
use
as
--
to
measuring
the
--
whether
or
not
her
pupils
have
understood
and
–
and
learned
the
material
provided.
now,
of
course
the
--
from
the
state's
standpoint,
it
should
be
remembered
that
the
state
is
--
is
only
concerned
in
how
these
particular
tests
measure
achievement
as
to
the
subjects
which
are
taught
also
in
public
schools.
it's
not
of
the
concern
of
the
state
nor
would
any
cost
analysis
process
here
be
used,
the
tests
which
are
directed
solely
to
the
--
to
sectarian,
subjects
of
sectarian
information.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
no,
except
in
this
regard
that
there
is
no
specific
regulation
of
the
commissioner
which
directs
the
public
schools
to
conduct
a
continuing
testing
program
--
an
in-school
testing
program.
the
education
department
relies
more
on
its
more
direct
and
continuing
supervision
of
the
public
schools
in
terms
of
evaluation.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
well,
right.
the
staff
and
their
continuing
relationship
and
much
more
direct
supervision
of
course
over
the
public
schools
and
they
have
(voice

ms.
jean
m.
coon
yes,
both
in
public
and
non-public
schools.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
it
does
not
require
them
to
conduct
this
continuing
program
--
ms.
jean
m.
coon
--
of
testings
under
this
regulation.
it
will
require
them
certainly
to
--
to
prepare
any
test
which
the
school
itself
intends
to
administer.
all
tests
administered
in
public
schools
are
not
statewide
tests.
there
are
teacher-prepared
test
there,
as
well.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
i
think
that
the
issue
is
probably
is
raised
probably
by
the
--
the
plaintiffs,
and
this
action
was
more
that
the
schools
were
paid.
we
submit
that
this
--
this
problem
payment
produces
considerably
less
entanglement
than
would
a
direct
administrative
(voice

sales
supervision.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
the
only
audit
that
was
--
has
been
done
of
this
has
been
the
--
the
cost
analysis
studies
which
were
done
on
a
selective
school
basis
comparing
the
cost
in
public
--
ms.
jean
m.
coon
--
and
non-public
schools.
no
there
is
not.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
yes.
it's
a
--
(voice

ms.
jean
m.
coon
right.
and
we
submit,
your
honor
that
there
would
be
much
more
entanglement
involved
here
where
the
state
to
have
to
send
inspectors
into
the
schools
or
test
administrators
into
the
schools
to
perform
this
function
there
that
this
is
--
that
the
payment
of
the
cost
of
administration
and
record-keeping
produces
substantially
less
entanglement
than
would
a
direct
supervision.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
well,
we
--
we
submit,
your
honor,
that
if
the
state
were
not
able
to
pay
--
ms.
jean
m.
coon
well,
the
state
has
--
has
an
interest
on
--
on
i
think
that
this
court
in
allen
certainly
said
that
the
states
do
have
the
interest
in
(voice

ms.
jean
m.
coon
by
auditing
the
test,
by
getting
reports
from
the
schools,
the
schools
are
required
to
submit
extensive
reports,
record-keeping
analysis
and
so
forth
--
ms.
jean
m.
coon
--
added
to
this
example.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
that's
what
the
test
--
the
tests
are
for.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
yes.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
that
is
quite
true,
your
honor.
the
payment
merely,
and
we
feel
--
just
that
we
feel
compensates
them
equitably
for
supplying
this
particular
service
to
the
state.
we
see
that
there's
no
--
(voice

ms.
jean
m.
coon
yes,
it
is,
your
honor.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
oh
no,
no,
your
honor.
i
don't
think
so
because
i
think
there's
a
difference.
the
teaching
function
of
the
schools
was
undertaken
voluntarily
by
the
schools
as
education.
the
fact
that
the
--
the
state's
requirement
which
has
been
superimposed
upon
the
schools
of
--
of
performing
and
keeping
all
these
records
and
reporting
and
so
forth
to
the
state
has
been
involuntary
function
of
the
schools
and
we
submit
that
having
imposed
this
requirement
upon
them
involuntarily
that
we
should
be
able
to
compensate
them
for
at
least
part
of
the
cost
of
it.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
only
since
they
have
voluntarily
undertaken
to
establish
themselves
as
a
school.
and
to
that
extent
the
--
the
teaching
function
has
been
voluntarily,
we
submit,
undertaken
by
the
schools.
(voice
overlap)
ms.
jean
m.
coon
oh
yes,
they
would
--
they
would
have
to
do
this
(voice
overlap)
ms.
jean
m.
coon
that
is
quite
true,
your
honor.
but
we
think
that
this
is
--
that
there's
more
to
this,
and
thus,
i
think
there's
certainly
a
state
interest
and
--
and
function
here
in
saying
that
these
pupils
not
only
are
in
school
but
that
they
are
receiving
certain
qualities
of
education,
and
so
forth
and
i
think
that
the
state
has
the
interest
in
--
in
compensating
the
schools
for
all
of
the
record
keeping
and
detailed
functions
that
we
have
imposed
upon
them.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
not
in
this
program,
your
honor.
however,
they
are
extending
certificating
requirements
under
other
programs
and
that
they,
certainly
the
basic
educational
data
system
which
they
have
to
file
with
the
state
does
request
information
concerning
the
education
of
the
teacher.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
not
in
the
--
ms.
jean
m.
coon
not
as
--
not
as
far
as
--
ms.
jean
m.
coon
no.
i
don't
think
that
they're
--
well
if
they
were
wholly
illiterate
and
could
teach
these
students
in
a
manner
in
which
he
(voice
overlap)
--
ms.
jean
m.
coon
i
would
--
i
would
think
so,
i
think
(voice
overlap)
that
the
--
the
thing
that
the
state
is
interested
here
is
in
the
result.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
there
are
standards
of
courses,
yes.
there
are
certain
courses
that
must
be
taught
in
the
schools
and
there
are
certain
levels
of
achievement
they
have
to
reach.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
yes,
your
honor.
no,
no.
no,
because
as
--
as
i
said
again
this
is
a
--
this
relates
to
the
fact
that
the
schools
have
voluntarily
established
themselves
as
schools.
to
that
extent,
we
would
agree
with
the
decision,
certainly
the
decision
of
this
court
in
lemon
that
the
state
cannot
pay
for
the
teaching
function.
what
we're
saying
here
is
we're
paying
for
a

a
non-idealogical
function
of
the

that's
simply
a

and
a
major

ms.
jean
m.
coon
for
this
particular
instance,
we
have
a
stipulated
cost
analysis
of
studies.
they're
in
the
record
which
--
which
indicates
that
the
amount
paid
to
the
schools
is
substantially
less
than
the
actual
cost
of
the
program
itself.
ms.
jean
m.

yes,
your
honor,
it
was.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
that
was
selected
--
the
selected
measurement
between
public
and
non-public
schools.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
that
has
not
been
required
in
the
past
in
new
york.
there
is,
i
believe,
some,
certainly
there
are
going
to
be
some
--
must
be
more
and
more
lay
teachers,
i
believe
reached
the
schools,
there
will
be
more
and
more

imposed.
ms.
jean
m.

mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
statute
at
issue
on
this
appeal,
chapter
138
of
the
new
york
laws
of
1970,
provides
for
the
payment
by
the
state
to
non-public
schools
within
the
state,
specific
sums
of
money
as
partial
reimbursement
of
the
expenses
of
record-keeping,
testing,
and
reporting
incurred
by
the
non-public
schools
in
complying
with
requirements
of
state
law
and
regulation.
the
laws
and
regulations
referred
to
have
been
enacted
for
the
purposes
of
the
examination
and
inspection
of
the
non-public
schools
by
the
state.
the
examination
of
this
statute
to
determine
its
validity,
must
we
feel
be
made
in
the
perspective
of
the
total
historical
educational
picture
in
the
state
of
new
york.
from
the
creation
of
the
university
of
the
state
of
new
york
in
1787,
the
regents
of
that
university
and
subsequently
the
commissioner
of
education
as
its
administrative
arm
had
a
general
supervision
over
all
educational
institutions
in
the
state
of
new
york,
both
public
and
private.
all
private
educational
institutions
from
elementary
grades
through
colleges
receive
their
charges
from
the
board
of
regents.
the
state
education
law
gives
the
commissioner
of
education
the
power
to
examine
and
inspect
private
as
well
as
public
institutions
of
learning,
to
determine
whether
or
not
they
comply
with
the
compulsory
attendance
and
instructional
requirements
of
the
state
law.
the
state
education
law
not
only
requires
children
to
regularly
attend
some
school,
either
public
or
private,
but
sets
minimum
standards
of
education
including
course
content
which
must
be
met
by
the
schools
which
these
children
attend,
in
order
that
their
attendance
does
comply
with
the
compulsory
attendance
laws.
the
importance
of
this
supervisory
function
to
the
states
concerned,
relative
to
its
children's
education
was
recognized
by
the
framers
of
the
state
constitution
in
1894
when
in
adding
a
provision
prohibiting
aid
to
sectarian
schools,
they
specifically
accepted
expenditures
of
money
for
the
purposes
of
examination
and
inspection,
in
the
carrying
out
of
this
function
of
examination
and
inspection
and
general
supervision
over
the
education
provided
by
non-public
schools
in
the
state.
the
state
requires
the
schools
to
perform
certain
testing,
record-keeping,
and
reporting
services
to
the
state.
among
these
are
the
administration
of
tests,
including
regents'
examinations
which
are
statewide
tests
of
specific
subject
matter
achievement,
pupil
evaluation
program
tests
in
grade
six
and
nine,
and
other
general
statewide
evaluation
tests
also
used
in
public
schools.
and
in
addition,
the
regulations
of
the
commissioner
of
education
require
the
non-public
schools
to
conduct
a
continuing
program
of
individual
pupil
testing
in
all
grades
to
provide
an
adequate
basis
for
evaluating
pupil
achievement.
in
addition
to
the
testing
program,
the
non-public
schools
are
required
to
maintain
health
records,
records
of
marks,
attendance
records,
provide
information
under
the
basic
educational
data
system,
which
includes
statistical
information
as
to
students,
teachers,
curricula
offered,
physical
plans
and
so
forth,
and
of
secondary
schools,
additional
data
on
a
more
detailed
basis
than
in
the
basic
educational
data
system.
these
requirements
imposed
upon
non-public
schools
by
law
or
regulations
involve
considerable
addition
expense
to
the
schools
for
which,
immediately
prior
to
the
enactment
of
chapter
i38,
the
schools
were
not
compensated.
while
immediately
prior
to
the
enactment
of
the
statute,
the
schools
were
not
compensated,
the
state
has
had
a
long
history
of
providing
some
compensation
to
some
non-public
schools
in
recognition
of
the
cost
burden
imposed
by
the
state
in
assuring
that
the
requirements
of
the
compulsory
attendance
laws
are
being
met.
beginning
in
1892,
appropriations
remain
annually
to
so
called
academies
for
services
in
connection
with
the
compulsory
attendance
laws.
those
academies
included
sectarian
and
non-sectarian,
secondary
non-public
schools.
the
provision
for
such
compensation
was
retained
in
the
state's
education
law
until
1930,
but
even
after
repeal
in
that
year,
appropriations
continued
to
be
made
and
in
the
state's
local
assistance
appropriation
bills,
in
connection
with
the
attendance
requirements
of
academic
pupils.
only
in
the
years
between
1968
and
the
enactment
of
the
legislation
at
issue
here
for
no
payments
made
to
any
non-public
schools
for
these
purposes.
the
legislation
adopted
in
1970
therefore,
merely
reinstated
a
past
practice
of
compensating
non-public
schools
for
record-keeping
and
examination
services
required
by
the
state
updated
the
amount
paid
to
reflect
current
economic
conditions
and
made
the
base
of
payment
more
equitable
by
including
all
non-public
schools
at
all-state
imposed
examination
and
recordkeeping
requirements.
the
cost
analysis
studies
made
for
the
state
education
department,
in
which
there
are
exhibits
in
this
case,
exhibits
d
and
g
in
a
separate
folder
of
exhibits
submitted
to
the
court,
and
which
were
made
by
three
individuals
acting
independently
of
each
other,
demonstrate
that
the
payments
made
to
the
non-public
schools
are
justified
in
amount,
and
are
still
substantially
less
for
the
actual
cost
of
performance
of
the
services.
appellees
do
not
dispute
these
conclusions,
except
by
alleging
that
the
administration
of
test
is
a
part
of
the
teaching
function
of
the
non-public
schools
and
then
consequently
new
york
is
paying
the
schools
for
the
cost
of
education.
this
is
a
matter
of
perspective.
from
the
state's
point
of
view,
we
are
not
paying
the
schools
to
administer
tests
as
part
of
the
educational
program
of
the
schools,
but
rather
as
a
method
of
evaluating
the
achievement
of
the
schools
in
meeting
minimum
standards
of
education.
this
assumes
that
the
teaching
function
per
se
has
been
completed
prior
to
the
administration
of
a
test
as
a
measuring
device,
and
we
submit
that
is
the
more
reasonable
viewpoint
on
the
aspect
of
the
state's
payment
--
in
this
--
this
regard.
the
past
decisions
of
this
court
have
not
prohibited
all
payments
or
benefits
to
non-public
schools.
justice,
they
have
not
permitted
all
payments
or
benefits.
in
everson,
the
activities
which
were
described
as
prohibited
were
those
directed
to
the
aid
of
religion
as
such.
in
mcgowan
this
court
observed
that
the
establishment
cost
does
not
ban
state
or
federal
regulations
of
conduct
whose
effect
merely
happens
to
coincide
with
the
tenets
of
some
religions.
again
in
everson,
the
court
expressed
the
concept
of
neutrality,
stating
that
the
constitution
does
not
require
the
state
to
be
the
adversary
of
religion.
in
both
(inaudible)
and
mcgowan,
this
court
discussed
the
intent
and
effect
test
by
which
a
statute
is
measured
as
to
whether
it
has
a
secular
legislative
intent
and
a
primary
effect
which
neither
aids
nor
inhibits
religion.
in
walz
the
test
by
which
legislations
were
being
measured
was
expanded
to
include
an
evaluation
as
to
where
the
statute
of
issue
created
an
excessive
entanglement
between
church
and
state.
in
discussing
whether
or
not
the
new
york
statute
here
at
issue
meets
objections
under
each
of
these
tests,
we
must
bear
in
mind
the
observation
of
this
court's
opinion
in
lemon
that
the
line
between
permissible
and
impermissible
legislation
is
not
a
wall
but
rather
a
blurred,
indistinct
and
variable
barrier
depending
on
all
the
circumstances
of
a
particular
relationship.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
yes,
your
honor,
because
the
--
the
state
commissioner's
regulations
require
the
non-public
schools
to
have
a
continual
–
in-school
program
of
testing
of
pupils
to
measure
educational
achievement
and
that
the
testing
involved
here
includes
not
only
the
general
test
imposed
by
the
state
which
are
statewide
in
application
but
also
the
state's
examination
of
the
test
administered
in
the
schools
to
determine
whether
or
not
the
pupils
in
all
grades
are
meeting
levels
of
educational
achievement.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
that
was
included
in
the
cost
analysis
studies.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
they
require
reports
to
be
made
to
the
commission
of
education.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
on
--
on
the
results
of
testing,
yes,
your
honor.
it
was
--
it
was
not
by
name
necessarily
but
by
program
of
evaluating
the
tests
given
the
results
of
the
tests
on
how
the
pupils
are
measuring
up
in
terms
of
whether
or
not,
their
--
their
measurement
complies
with
the
general
standards
of
education
of
children
in
similar
grades
in
the
public
schools.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
it
would
be
possible
to
so
construe
it
and
that
might
raise
a
question
as
to
the
relationship
of
the
amount
paid.
there
was
a
--
there
was
a
cost
analysis
study
which
is
exhibit
g
which
referred
only
to
the
statewide
tests
and
comes
less
than
the
amount
paid
to
the
schools.
however,
that
it
should
also
be
noted
that
that
particular
cost
analysis
study,
while
it
related
only
to
statewide
tests,
do
not
include
the
other
record-keeping
functions
such
as
health
records
and
attendance
records
and
so
forth
which
were
included
in
the
other
studies
which
included
the
teacher
testing.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
no,
your
honor
it
has
not.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
it
is
conceivable,
your
honor.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
no,
your
honor
they
are
not.
they
are
--
ms.
jean
m.
coon
yes,
your
honor,
they
are.
they're
required
by
the
commission
--
commissioner's
regulations.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
i
would
assume
any
type
of
test
the
teacher
would
use
as
--
to
measuring
the
--
whether
or
not
her
pupils
have
understood
and
–
and
learned
the
material
provided.
now,
of
course
the
--
from
the
state's
standpoint,
it
should
be
remembered
that
the
state
is
--
is
only
concerned
in
how
these
particular
tests
measure
achievement
as
to
the
subjects
which
are
taught
also
in
public
schools.
it's
not
of
the
concern
of
the
state
nor
would
any
cost
analysis
process
here
be
used,
the
tests
which
are
directed
solely
to
the
--
to
sectarian,
subjects
of
sectarian
information.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
no,
except
in
this
regard
that
there
is
no
specific
regulation
of
the
commissioner
which
directs
the
public
schools
to
conduct
a
continuing
testing
program
--
an
in-school
testing
program.
the
education
department
relies
more
on
its
more
direct
and
continuing
supervision
of
the
public
schools
in
terms
of
evaluation.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
well,
right.
the
staff
and
their
continuing
relationship
and
much
more
direct
supervision
of
course
over
the
public
schools
and
they
have
(voice

ms.
jean
m.
coon
yes,
both
in
public
and
non-public
schools.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
it
does
not
require
them
to
conduct
this
continuing
program
--
ms.
jean
m.
coon
--
of
testings
under
this
regulation.
it
will
require
them
certainly
to
--
to
prepare
any
test
which
the
school
itself
intends
to
administer.
all
tests
administered
in
public
schools
are
not
statewide
tests.
there
are
teacher-prepared
test
there,
as
well.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
i
think
that
the
issue
is
probably
is
raised
probably
by
the
--
the
plaintiffs,
and
this
action
was
more
that
the
schools
were
paid.
we
submit
that
this
--
this
problem
payment
produces
considerably
less
entanglement
than
would
a
direct
administrative

sales
supervision.
ms.
jean
m.

the
only
audit
that
was

has
been
done
of
this
has
been
the

the
cost

which
were
done
on

comparing
the

is
not.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
yes.
it's
a
--
(voice

ms.
jean
m.
coon
right.
and
we
submit,
your
honor
that
there
would
be
much
more
entanglement
involved
here
where
the
state
to
have
to
send
inspectors
into
the
schools
or
test
administrators
into
the
schools
to
perform
this
function
there
that
this
is
--
that
the
payment
of
the
cost
of
administration
and
record-keeping
produces
substantially
less
entanglement
than
would
a
direct
supervision.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
well,
we
--
we
submit,
your
honor,
that
if
the
state
were
not
able
to
pay
--
ms.
jean
m.
coon
well,
the
state
has
--
has
an
interest
on
--
on
i
think
that
this
court
in
allen
certainly
said
that
the
states
do
have
the
interest
in
(voice

ms.
jean
m.
coon
by
auditing
the
test,
by
getting
reports
from

the

are
required
to
submit
extensive
reports,
record-keeping
analysis
and
so
forth
--
ms.
jean

--
added
to
this
example.
ms.

that's
what
the
test

the

are
for.
ms.

yes.
ms.

that
is
quite
true,
your
honor.
the

merely,
and
we
feel
--
just
that
we
feel
compensates
them
equitably
for
supplying
this
particular
service
to
the
state.
we
see
that
there's
no

(voice

ms.
jean
m.
coon
yes,
it
is,
your
honor.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
oh
no,
no,
your
honor.
i
don't
think
so
because
i
think
there's
a
difference.
the
teaching
function
of
the
schools
was
undertaken
voluntarily
by
the
schools
as
education.
the
fact
that
the
--
the
state's
requirement
which
has
been
superimposed
upon
the
schools
of
--
of
performing
and
keeping
all
these
records
and
reporting
and
so
forth
to
the
state
has
been
involuntary
function
of
the
schools
and
we
submit
that
having
imposed
this
requirement
upon
them
involuntarily
that
we
should
be
able
to
compensate
them
for
at
least
part
of
the
cost
of
it.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
only
since
they
have
voluntarily
undertaken
to
establish
themselves
as
a
school.
and
to
that
extent
the
--
the
teaching
function
has
been
voluntarily,
we
submit,
undertaken
by
the
schools.
(voice

ms.
jean
m.
coon
oh
yes,
they
would
--
they
would
have
to
do
this
(voice

ms.
jean
m.
coon
that
is
quite
true,
your
honor.
but
we
think
that
this
is
--
that
there's
more
to
this,
and
thus,
i
think
there's
certainly
a
state
interest
and
--
and
function
here
in
saying
that
these
pupils
not
only
are
in
school
but
that
they
are
receiving
certain
qualities
of
education,
and
so
forth
and
i
think
that
the
state
has
the
interest
in
--
in
compensating
the
schools
for
all
of
the
record
keeping
and
detailed
functions
that
we
have
imposed
upon
them.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
not
in
this
program,
your
honor.
however,
they
are
extending
certificating
requirements
under
other
programs
and
that
they,
certainly
the
basic
educational
data
system
which
they
have
to
file
with
the
state
does
request
information
concerning
the
education
of
the
teacher.

i
don't
think
that
they're

if
they
were
wholly
illiterate
and
could
teach
these

in

ms.
jean
m.
coon
i
would
--
i
would
think
so,
i
think
(voice
overlap)
that
the
--
the
thing
that
the
state
is
interested
here
is
in
the
result.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
there
are
standards
of
courses,
yes.
there
are
certain
courses
that
must
be
taught
in
the
schools
and
there
are
certain
levels
of
achievement
they
have
to
reach.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
yes,
your
honor.
no,
no.
no,
because
as
--
as
i
said
again
this
is
a
--
this
relates
to
the
fact
that
the
schools
have
voluntarily
established
themselves
as
schools.
to
that
extent,
we
would
agree
with
the
decision,
certainly
the
decision
of
this
court
in
lemon
that
the
state
cannot
pay
for
the
teaching
function.
what
we're
saying
here
is
we're
paying
for
a
neutral,
a
non-idealogical
function
of
the
school
that's
simply
a
record
keeping
program
and
a
major
achievement
measurement
program.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
for
this
particular
instance,
we
have
a
stipulated
cost
analysis
of
studies.
they're
in
the
record
which
--
which
indicates
that
the
amount
paid
to
the
schools
is
substantially
less
than
the
actual
cost
of
the
program
itself.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
yes,
your
honor,
it
was.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
that
was
selected
--
the
selected
measurement
between
public
and
non-public
schools.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
that
has
not
been
required
in
the
past
in
new
york.
there
is,
i
believe,
some,
certainly
there
are
going
to
be
some
--
must
be
more
and
more
lay
teachers,
i
believe
reached
the
schools,
there
will
be
more
and
more
qualification
imposed.
