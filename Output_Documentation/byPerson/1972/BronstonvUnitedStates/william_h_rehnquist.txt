am

right
in
thinking
that
both
judge
oaks
and
judge
lumbard
concluded
the
question
was
not
ambiguous?
justice
william

rehnquist
does
the
referee
have
the
sort
of
contempt
power
that
a
district
court
would
have
in
the
case
of
a
genuinely
obdurate
witness?

put
him

answer

if
he--
if
the
man
does
it
in

question,
then
the
referee
must
seek
the
aid
of

certainly,
if
it
were

action,

would
support
a

no,

if
i’m
interrogating
you
orally
about
what
kind
of
a
stock
it
is,
i
certainly
do
ask
the
questions.
justice

rehnquist

mr.
frey,
i
think
to
most
everybody
who
has
practiced
law
your
first
reaction
to
that
set
of
questions
is
if
you
had
been
the
examining
attorney
and
got
an
answer
you
liked,
you
would’ve
said
“yes,
but
how
about
your
own
accounts?”
the--
i
don’t
think
you
have
to
know
the
existence
of
the
geneva
account
to
feel
that
the
answer
is
almost
a
red
flag
to
any
lawyer
who’s
paying
attention
to
the
examination.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
or
you
could
start
out
with
a
good
question
in
the
first
place,
“name

was
