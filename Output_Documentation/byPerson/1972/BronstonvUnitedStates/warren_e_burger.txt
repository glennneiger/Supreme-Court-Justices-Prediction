mr.
elsen,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you’re
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
alleged,
yes.[attempt
to
laughter]
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
you
don’t
suggest
that
this
was
not
an
evasive
answer.
i’m
not
suggesting
that’s
the
issue
in
the
case.
he’s
not
indicted,
is
he?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
no,
excuse
me.
the
answer
you
gave
to
the
creditor.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
that’s
why
i
put
the
question.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
it
an
evasive
answer?
it
is
an--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
judge
lumbard
thought
it
was,
as
i
read
his
dissent,
thought
it
was
an
evasive
answer
that
should’ve
put
the
questioner
in
search
of
more
answers.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and,
which
should
in
turn
have
led
the
questioner
to
pursue
it
if
they
were
thinking
about
a
perjury
proceeding.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
what
do
you
say
the
first
question
was
directed
at
and
what
do
you
say
the
witness
thought
it
was
directed
at?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
whose
bank
accounts?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
think
it--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
think
the
first
question
was
ambiguous?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
have
only
two
minutes
of
it
left,
so
you
better
make
that
judgment.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
mr.
frey.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
you
say,
mr.
frey,
that
the
majority
of
the
second
circuit
in
this
case
read
this
answer
to
question
number
two
as
though
he
had
said
“no,
but
my
company
did”?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
have
to
read
that
“no”
into
it,
don’t
you?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
second
circuit
is
treating
the
answer
given
as
though--
do
you
agree
that
that’s
the
way
they’re
treating
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
you
say
that’s
the
necessary
implication,
the
inevitable
implication.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
the
essence
that
you
responded
to
there,
suggests
that
you
can
be
found
guilty
of
the
criminal
act
of
perjury
by
implication.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
that
would
be
very
persuasive
to
me
if
this
were
a
verdict
in
a
civil
case,
as
mr.
justice
rehnquist
suggested,
a
verdict
in
a
civil
case
for
fraud
and
the
jury
then
return
a
verdict
treating
this
as
fraudulent
answer,
a
dishonest
answer.
don’t
you
have
a
different
standard
when
you’re
dealing
with
the
perjury
case?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
putting
it
in
another
way
that
i
think
an
appellate
court
would
have
very
little
difficulty
affirming
a
judgment
in
a
civil
fraud
case
with
this
structure
of
questions
and
answers,
but
that
doesn’t
carry
you
all
the
way
in
a
criminal
case,
does
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
i
suppose
part
of
the
problem
is
that,
on
the
day
the
creditor’s
counsel
was
asking
these
questions,
he
wasn’t
thinking
about
a
perjury
case
in
a
federal
district
court,
a
criminal
prosecution.
but,
now
we’re
here
and
we
must
think
about
it.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
no,
i
said
the
creditor’s
counsel.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
creditor’s
counsel
was
focused
on
general
inquiry.
he
wasn’t
undertaking
to
cast
his
questions
in
a
precision
of
a
criminal
prosecution.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
mr.
frey.

case
