mr.
sheldon
h.
elsen
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit.
petitioner
was
convicted
on
one
count
of
perjury
under
the
federal
perjury
statute,
18
usc
1621.
the
appeal
raises
issues
relating
to
the
legal
standards
applicable
under
the
federal
perjury
statute.
the
conviction
was
affirmed
in
a
split
decision
of
the
circuit,
two-to-one.
now,
the
facts
are
quite
simple
and
i
will
put
them
briefly.
the
perjury
arose
out
of
interrogation
in
a
hearing.
the
alleged
perjury,
that
is
the
question.
mr.
sheldon
h.
elsen
the
hearing
was
in
a
bankruptcy
court
before
a
referee
in
bankruptcy.
the
questioning
was
done
by
an
attorney
for
one
of
the
creditors.
the
examination
was
under
section
21
(a).
now,
the
petitioner
had
a
company.
he
was
the
sole
stockholder
and
the
president.
the
company
had
filed
a
petition
under
chapter
11
of
the
bankruptcy
act.
the
purpose
of
the
21
(a)
examination
was
to
inquire
into
assets
of
the
corporation.
because
of
the
petitioner’s
relation
to
the
company
as
president
and
sole
stockholder,
creditors
and
their
counsel
were
entitled,
if
they
so
chose,
to
ask
about
his
personal
assets,
and
there
is
no
dispute
on
that
question.
late
in
the
afternoon
of
the
examination,
four
questions
were
asked
which
are
the
subject
of
this
case.
they
are
set
forth
at
page
3
of
our
brief.
two
commercial
questions
were:
question:
“do
you
have
any
bank
accounts
in
swiss
banks,
mr.
brontson?
answer:
“no,
sir.”
question:
“have
you
ever?”
answer:
“the
company
had
an
account
there
for
about
six
months
in
zurich.”
the
last
two
questions
related
to
nominee
accounts
and
they’re
of
no
further
consequence
here.
the
government
did
not
dispute
the
truthfulness
of
either
of
these
answers.
mr.
bronston
had
had
a
personal
bank
account
in
geneva,
and
the
prosecution
proceeded
on
the
theory
that
he
committed
perjury
by
not
saying
so
in
answer
to
the
second
question,
“have
you
ever?”
now,
it
was
undisputed
that
the
account
had
been
closed
some-two
years
before
the
questioning
took
place
and
that
it
had
been
dormant
for
some-four
years
before
the
questioning
took
place.
there
were
no
assets
in
the
account
and
there
had
not
been
any
assets
beyond
an
insignificant
amount
since
1962,
some-four
years
before
the
questioning,
some-two
years
before
the
company
filed
its
petition
for
an
arrangement.
although
the
accounts
asked
about--
the
account
asked
about
were
in
switzerland,
these
were
not
numbered--
this
was
not
a
numbered
account.
it
was
in
mr.
bronston’s
name.
it
was
opened
in
an
ordinary
commercial
transaction.
his
company
did
business
in
switzerland.
it
was
an
international
company
that
did
business
all
over
the
world.
he
had
a
child
in
a
school
in
switzerland.
he
drew
checks
on
this
account
and
he
signed
them
with
his
name.
mr.
sheldon
h.
elsen
the
time
that
they
chose
to
indict?
mr.
sheldon
h.
elsen
i--
you
mean
whether
the
attorney
for
the
creditor
knew
all
this?
mr.
sheldon
h.
elsen
i
don’t
know
that,
mr.
justice
douglas.
the
government
was
not
a
party
to
the
hearing.
mr.
sheldon
h.
elsen
it
was
a
private
hearing.
mr.
sheldon
h.
elsen
a
creditor
brought
the
information
into
the
government
about
the
bank
account
because
mr.
bronston
had
given
his
creditors
a
general
waiver
that
they
could
go
into
any
bank
account.
the
government
did
not
call
the
man
in
to
explain
it
and
they
simply
indicted.
i
represented
him
at
that
time.
it
is
not
in
the
record,
but
i
can
tell
you.
we
were
never
called
in
to
talk
about
this
case,
and
i
would
suspect
that
there
would--
that
had
this
been
explained
that
there
would
not
have
been
an
indictment
but,
of
course,
that’s
not
a
question
of
law.
mr.
sheldon
h.
elsen
--
you
mean
as
to
the
question
to
the
exercise
of
the
prosecutor
of
discretion?
mr.
chief
justice--
mr.
sheldon
h.
elsen
mr.
chief
justice,
i
would
say
this,
and
i
want
to
answer
your
question
directly.
that
had
the
witness
been
a
candidate
for
high
office
and
had
answered
the
questions
in
this
fashion,
and
if
i
were
sitting
on
a
committee
appraising
it,
i
would
be
troubled
by
this
kind
of
answer
but
i
would
not
have
prosecuted
him
criminally.
mr.
sheldon
h.
elsen
yes.
mr.
sheldon
h.
elsen
no,
i
don’t
say
that
it’s
evasive,
and
i
will
get
into
that.
it
may
have
been
evasive.
mr.
sheldon
h.
elsen
judge
lumbard
proceeded
on
the
assumption
that
the
question
was
not
ambiguous.
if
the
question
was
directed
at
personal
account,
mr.
chief
justice,
then,
of
course,
an
answer
about
the
company’s
account
is
a
patently
unresponsive
answer
and
should’ve
put
the
questioner
on
notice
that
he
had
to
ask
another
question
and
get
an
answer
about
a
personal
account.
judge--
mr.
sheldon
h.
elsen
correct.
that’s
correct.
mr.
sheldon
h.
elsen
if
he
was
interested
in
the
account.
if
he
was
interested
in
the--
in
a
personal
account,
he
should’ve
pursued
this.
he
had
a
question
and
an
answer,
a
truthful
answer
about
the
company.
the
company
was
in
chapter
11,
not
the
individual.
if
indeed
he
were
interested
in
a
personal
account,
he
should’ve
known
that
he
had
not
received
information
about
a
personal
account
and
should’ve
asked
that
next
question,
“what
about
a
personal
account?”
that’s
what
judge
lumbard
said
indeed.
now,
there
are--
just
to--
i
think
i
have
essentially
completed
the
general
picture
of
the
facts
and
i’ve
mentioned
that
the
account
was
uncovered,
not
uncovered
but
the
records
were
procured
by
a
creditor
who
had
been
given,
along
with
the
other
creditor,
the
general
waiver.
now,
there
are
essentially
three
issues,
one
of
which
i
will
not
discuss.
one
of
which--
the
third
being
relating
to
the
evidence,
i
will
not
discuss
that,
but
i
would
like
to
frame
it
and
the
chief
justice
has
perhaps
taken
me
down
that
line,
but
if
i
may
frame
the
issues.
either
the
question
“have
you
ever?”
was
ambiguous,
in
which
case
there
should’ve
been
questioning
to
spell
the
ambiguity
but
there
was
not
perjury.
it
was
ambiguous
because
if
a
company
executive
is
asked
“how
many
cars
did
you
manufactured
in
june,
mr.
ford?”
the
word
“you”
applies
to
a
company,
“how
long
have
you
been
driving?”
applies
to
an
individual.
“do
you
have
any
bank
accounts
in
switzerland
or
have
you
had
any
bank
accounts
in
switzerland?”
could
apply
to
either,
and
this
is
particularly
true
in
a
context
of
an
american
bankruptcy
of
an
international
company
because
the
assets
in
switzerland
or
other
foreign
jurisdictions
would
not
be
under
the
jurisdiction
in
the
american
bankruptcy
court,
and
creditors
may
very
well
have
chosen
to
inquire
into
company
accounts
abroad
so
that
they
might
seek
some
form
of
ansulary
of
bankruptcy.
there
was
indeed
one
in
spain.
a
creditor
may
have
chosen
to
go
into
switzerland,
and
that’s
another
reason,
mr.
chief
justice,
when
i
say
it’s
not
all
that
clear
that
this
was
an
evasive
answer.
judge
lumbard
proceeded
on
the
assumption
that
he
must
have
been
talking
about
a
personal
account,
but
when
you
reflect
upon
the
problems
of
international
bankruptcies
of
companies
with
assets
all
over
the
world,
it’s
not
unreasonable
to
believe
that
the
witness
thought
he
was
being
asked
about
the
company’s
accounts.
he
asked-
he
answered
about
the
company’s
accounts
and
if
the
question
meant
personal,
he
could’ve
said
so.
but,
if
we
assume,
as
judge
lumbard
said,
that
it
was
not
ambiguous
but
was
directed
to
a
personal
account,
then
the
questioner
could
not
have
been
put
off.
it
was
patently
unresponsive.
it
was
about
a
company
account,
and
that
raises
then
the
second
question
of
whether
a
truthful
and
clearly
unresponsive
answer
should
be
the
basis
for
a
criminal
conviction
of
perjury.
now,
there’s
that
second
question
which,
i
think,
raises
the
most
intriguing
conceptual
problems
and
which
the
court
may
very
well
wish
to
ask
more
questions
about,
but
i
have
chosen
to
argue
first
the
question
of
ambiguity
for
the
purpose
of
the
clarity
of
the
argument.
i
think
you
will
find
that
if
we
discuss
that
first
the
whole
discussion
will
proceed
in
a
more
easily
followed
manner.
and,
when
i
begin
the
discussion
of
policy,
i
want
to
come
back
again
to
the
point
i
was
discussing
with
the
chief
justice,
that
is,
this
is
a
criminal
case.
it’s
obvious,
but
it
is
fundamental
here.
there
are--
is
reference
in
some
of
the
briefs
to
the
fact
that
we
want
to
encourage
great
candor
when
we
have
a
person
coming
for
executive
commission
and
judicial
appointment
and
admission
to
the
bar,
and
i
do
not
question
any
of
that.
i
think
that
if
we
were
passing
on
the
admission
of
a
person
to
a
position
of
high
public
trust,
we
would
insist
on
the
absolute
maximum
forthcoming
type
of
candor
and
disclosure,
but
that’s
a
far
cry
from
dealing
with
the
question
of
a
layman
being
asked
questions
by
a
lawyer
who
is
satisfied
with
the
answer,
does
not
go
on
to
ask
the
next
question,
and
to
put
the
layman
in
jail
or
to
brand
him
a
felon
and,
that,
i
submit,
is
the
issue
here.
it’s
obvious
but
it
can’t
be
said
too
often.
that’s
the
issue.
mr.
sheldon
h.
elsen
mr.
justice
white,
the--
mr.
sheldon
h.
elsen
that’s
correct,
although,
mr.
justice
white,
i
would
probably
prefer
to
phrase
it
in
terms
of
the
fact
that
the
case
on
the
evidence
on
the
government’s
evidence
did
not
fall
within
the
standard
which
we
should
set
down
for
a
criminal
case
of
perjury.
mr.
sheldon
h.
elsen
it’s
another
way
of
putting
the
same.
mr.
sheldon
h.
elsen
well--
mr.
sheldon
h.
elsen
we’re
not
raising
that
point
on
this
appeal.
mr.
sheldon
h.
elsen
but,
the
government
did
say
at
one
point
that
the
ambiguity
issue
was
charged
to
the
jury,
and
that’s
not
so.
we’ve
stated--
we’ve
set
forth
the
entire
charge
on
this,
that
the
charge
on
ambiguity
was
specifically
directed
to
the
second
count.
mr.
sheldon
h.
elsen
yes,
that’s
correct.
the--
mr.
sheldon
h.
elsen
the
instructions
were
the
judge
charged
to
the
contrary
of
our
position
on
the
question
of
a
truthful
answer
and
the
jury,
following
that
instruction,
found--
mr.
sheldon
h.
elsen
that’s
correct.
mr.
sheldon
h.
elsen
that’s
correct,
assuming
that
the
elements
were
correctly
stated
by
the
judge.
mr.
sheldon
h.
elsen
never
have
gone
to
the
jury.
they
should’ve
been
dismissed
on
a
motion
at
the
close
of
the
government’s
case
claiming
that
it
should’ve
been
set
aside
the
end
of
the
case.
now,
on
the
question
of
ambiguity,
we
do
have
some
circuit
court
authority
which--
incidentally,
i
might
start
by
saying
that
neither
of
these
issues
seem
to,
before,
have
been
before
this
court.
we
do
have
circuit
court
authority
which
says
that
an
ambiguous
question
should
not
form
a
basis
for
a
charge
of
perjury
where
the
answer
to
one
possible
meaning
is
truthful.
we
have
circuit
court
authority
supporting
lumbard’s
opinion.
mr.
sheldon
h.
elsen
yes?
mr.
sheldon
h.
elsen
that
is
correct.
the
entire
circuit
was
against
us
on
this
question
but
i
think,
in
all
fairness,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
that
the
court
erred
in
that
respect
and
i
urge
that
error
before
this
court.
the--
what--
the
most
thoughtful
study
of
the
whole
perjury
that
we
have
uncovered
is
the
comprehensive
study
of
the
american
law
institute,
which
is
embodied
in
detailed
comments
to
the
draft
of
the
model
penal
code.
that
seems
to
be
the
one
place
where
not
only
the
law
is
explored,
but
a
detailed
and
careful
and--
examination
of
the
rationale
underneath
the
law
is
set
forth.
and,
on
the
question
of
ambiguity,
the
american
law
institute
says,
and
i
want
you
to
find
the
word
“official
interrogation,”
as
they
used
it,
that
means
interrogation
under
the
model
penal
code
before
an
officer,
a
judge,
a
hearing,
a
referee,
and
the
like.
that
is
the
type
of
interrogation
we
had
here.
the
american
law
institute
concluded--
mr.
sheldon
h.
elsen
that’s
at
page
2
of
our
reply
brief,
mr.
justice
powell.
it
does
not
seem
unfair
to
require
official
interrogation
to
be
sufficiently
specific
so
that
the
variety
of
declaring
statements
can
be
measured
against
something
else
than
a
guess
as
to
how
he
interpreted
the
question
against
something
else
than
a
guess.
in
the
sixth
circuit,
in
developing
a
related
rationale
five
years
ago,
said
that
you
cannot
have
a
fair
test
of
the
witness’
belief
in
the
truthfulness
of
his
answer
where
the
question
propounded
admits
of
several
plausible
meaning.
now,
says
the
government,
the
ambiguity
is
eliminated
by
the
question
preceding
the
“have
you
ever?”
because
it
reads
“do
you
have
any
bank
accounts
in
swiss
banks,
mr.
bronston?”
now,
i
would
submit
that
you
could
ask
mr.
ford
“how
many
cars
did
you
manufacture
in
june,
mr.
ford?”
and
that
would
not
make
it
a
question
about
personal
activities.
mr.
sheldon
h.
elsen
what
i
say
the
first
question
is
directed
at
is
bank
accounts.
mr.
sheldon
h.
elsen
and,
bank
accounts
could
be
the
property
of
the
company,
which
was
the
subject
of
the
examination,
mr.
chief
justice--
mr.
sheldon
h.
elsen
or
the
individual.
mr.
sheldon
h.
elsen
yes,
indeed,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
do,
indeed.
this
is
in
a--
mr.
sheldon
h.
elsen
yes,
this
is--
mr.
sheldon
h.
elsen
correct.
mr.
sheldon
h.
elsen
that
is
quite
correct.
that
is
the
funda--
the
major
premise
of
the
entire
ambiguity.
mr.
sheldon
h.
elsen
the
corporation
no
longer
had
a
bank
account.
mr.
sheldon
h.
elsen
he
no
longer--
mr.
sheldon
h.
elsen
that’s
quite
correct.
mr.
sheldon
h.
elsen
that
was
truthful,
but
it
also
does
not
establish
a
context
of
inquiry
to
personal
bank
accounts.
i
think
i
have
suggested
in
my
opening
remarks
why
it
is
that
the
witness
could
reasonably
have
reached
this
conclusion.
mr.
sheldon
h.
elsen
yes.
mr.
sheldon
h.
elsen
i
don’t
believe
that
i
have
to
go
that
far,
mr.
justice
brennan.
mr.
sheldon
h.
elsen
well,
companies
could
have
nominees.
mr.
sheldon
h.
elsen
as
a
matter
of
fact,
it’s
a
common
practice
of
foreign
corporations
to
use
nominees
in
swiss
banks
in
order
to
open
up
the--
an
account
without
having
to
comply
with
swiss
banking
law
for
corporate
resolutions
and
the
like.
it
gets
rather
intricate.
they
often
use
individuals
for
that
purpose,
so
that
that
very
well
could
have
been.
the
point
is
we
were
dealing
with
an
intricate
situation
and
that
if
the--
and
the
witness
may
have
thought
one
thing.
he
may
have
thought
the
other.
the
point
is,
before
we
make
this
perjury,
we
should
not
have
to
guess.
it’s
not
fair,
but
that’s--
mr.
sheldon
h.
elsen
at
the
trial?
mr.
sheldon
h.
elsen
he
did
not
take
the
stand.
mr.
sheldon
h.
elsen
he
did
not
take
the
stand.
there
were
witnesses
from
the
company
who
had
testified
that
the
account
had
not
been
kept
secret.
there
was
nothing
that
the
petitioner
had
to
add
to
that.
there
was
no
case
but
the
fact
that
there
was
an
account,
which
he
conceded
at
all
times.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
swiss
bank
officer
who
testified
for
the
government
testified
under--
with
mr.
bronston’s
permission,
which
we
sent
to
switzerland
because
of
the
requirements
of
the
swiss
banking
laws.
so,
there
was
no
dispute
about
the
fact
of
this
account.
the
question
was
what
was
going
on
during
the
interrogation.
now,
i
turn
to
the
other
horn
of
the
issue.
the
question
which
starts
with
the
assumption,
which
i
submit
is
really
unrealistic
here
but,
it
starts
with
the
assumption
that
the
inquiry
was
clearly
and
unambiguously
addressed
to
a
personal
account
and,
in
that
context,
we
have
an
unresponsive
answer
which
the
government--
which
the
creditor’s
lawyer
could
readily
have
cured
by
asking
a
question,
“have
you
personally
ever
had
any
swiss
bank
accounts?”
he
could’ve
insisted
easily
on
a
responsive
answer
if
he
wanted
one.
the
referee
was
right
there.
the
witness
would’ve
had
to
answer
the
questions
if
the
lawyer
had
wanted
to
ask
them.
mr.
sheldon
h.
elsen
oh,
yes.
i
think
the
referee
has
to
invoke
the
aid
of
the
district
court,
but
there’s--
mr.
sheldon
h.
elsen
he
did
direct
it,
yes.
the
referee
was
directing
“you
answer
that
question.”
mr.
sheldon
h.
elsen
i
believe
that’s
the
law,
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
but,
nevertheless,
may
i
say
that
the
atmosphere
of
the
referee’s
court
was
a
courtroom
and
the
obdurate
witness
is
a
rare
sight,
a
rara
avis
indeed
who
will
quarrel
with
a
referee
sitting
on
the
bench,
and
i
might
also
point
out
that
the
right
of
counsel
is
not
generally
recognized.
the
witness
doesn’t--
he
does
not
have
a
lawyer,
has
the
right
to
get
up
and
say
“i
object.”
the
witness
is
on
his
own.
now,
there
was
a
lawyer
sitting
there
for
part
of
the
hearing,
but
the
referee
made
it
clear
what
the
practice
is
in
the
bankruptcy
court.
we
do
not
make
an
issue
of
this
point
because
i
think
that
there
is
a--
the
issue
that
we
raise
here
has
to
do
with
the
interrogation,
but
that
is
part
of
the
set.
mr.
sheldon
h.
elsen
why
do
we
concede
materiality?
mr.
sheldon
h.
elsen
that’s
really--
we
concede
materiality
because
the
law
is
extensive
that,
in
a
bankruptcy,
we
will
not
dispute
the
fact
that
you
could’ve
asked
about--
just
about
anything
that
he
had
done
during
a
period.
mr.
sheldon
h.
elsen
no.
there
wasn’t
a
nickel
to
be
had
or
the
estate
in
any
way
to
be
affected
by
the
answer
to
a
question
about
the
person--
about
this
personal
bank
account,
and
no
one
has
ever
taken
any
action
as
a
result
of
the
disclosure
of
the
transcript
of
this
account
which
was
procured
in
response
to
his
way
over
bank
secrecy,
so
that,
it
has
had
no
effect
but
we
have
not
argued
the
question
of
materiality
simply
because
of
a
law
in
this
area.
it
is
against
us
and--
on
that
question,
and
we
do
not
dispute
it.
now,
i
would
like
to
point
out,
before
i
sit
down,
the
broad
sweep
of
a
rule
that
would
permit
a
criminal
conviction
for
a
truthful
but
non-responsive
answer
because
the
non-responsive
question
occurs
every
day
in
the
law
with
the
most
honest
witness
who
is
being
examined.
in
pretrial
depositions,
the
witness
who
does
not
want
to
volunteer
about
his
other
business
affairs,
about
his
friends’
lives,
about
his
private
life
and
who
will
wait
until
he
is
pushed,
that
witness
comes
up
all
the
time.
now
you
may
say,
in
a
pure
platonic
society,
maybe
we
shouldn’t
be
that
way,
but
that’s
the
way
the
real
world
is
and
i
think
that
we
all
know
that
from
our
experience
at
the
bar.
this
goes
on
constantly,
and
witnesses
sometimes
don’t
know
why
the
lawyer
doesn’t
presume
the
witness--
the
lawyer
may
shift
his
interest.
he
may
decide
to
use
a
different
line
of
inquiry
or
he
has
what
he
wants
and
doesn’t
want
to
get
into
a
dispute
over
a
point
he
doesn’t
want
to
go
to
court
to
get
a
ruling.
so,
he
lets
the
matter
drop,
but
if
it--
the
rule
is
that
a
truthful
but
unresponsive
answer
constitutes
perjury.
every
time
the
questioner
leaves
the
unresponsive
answer
on
the
question,
you
have
a
prima
facie
case
of
perjury.
now,
that
is
the
most
disturbing
aspect
of
this
entire
case
mr.
sheldon
h.
elsen
i
would
not
concede
that,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
but
i
would
draw
this
distinction
and
the
ali
draws
this.
in
a
civil
fraud
action,
the
actor,
the
person
making
the
statement,
controls
the
framing
of
the
representations.
he
can--
if
i’m
selling
you
stock
and
i,
say,
give
you
a
perspective,
you
cannot
ask
me
the
next
question.
mr.
sheldon
h.
elsen
well,
the
normal
civil
fraud
situation
arises
out
of
representations
where
the
actor
controls
the
representations,
and
the
american
law
institute
in
the
model
penal
code
does
say
that
there
should
be
a
stricter
standard
for
that
type
of
situation
than
for
the
interrogation
situation
where
counsel
was
in
the
position
to
frame
the
issues,
to
ask
the
next
question,
and
to
pursue
and
i
would
say,
though
i
certainly
do
not
say
that
this
is
a
fraud
particularly
in
the
light
of
the
nature
of
the
questioning
here
and
the
nature
of
the
economic
interests
that
were
involved
here
where
there
was
indeed
no
motive.
that
if
we
assume
all
those
things
that
i
have
assumed
to
reach
this
point
of
the
discussion,
nevertheless,
a
truthful
and
unresponsive
answer
cut
so
broadly
that
it
would
either--
a
rule
of
this
would
either
be
unenforced
thus
inviting
disrespect
for
the
law,
or
it
would
be
enforced
most
frequently
against
those
in
disfavor.
now,
the
model
penal
code
deals
with
an
analogous
issue.
it
is
not
an
identical
issue,
but
it
raises
the
same
policy
problems.
in
a
treatment
of
the
remington
type
problem,
the
ca--
the
problem
arising
from
the
united
states
versus
remington
where
the
ali
says
the
likelihood
of
achieving
moral
reformation
by
imprisoning
one
who
has
objectively
told
the
truth
is
not
high.
encouraging
the
police
to
inquire
as
to
subjective
dishonesty
behind
the
objective
truth
would
not
only
waste
their
time,
but
open
substantial
possibility
of
abuse.
now,
i
see--
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time
for
rebuttal,
but
i
would
like
to
simply
make
one
point.
mr.
sheldon
h.
elsen
well,
then
i
will
simply
say
this.
this
is
not
a
case
involving
material
omissions
either,
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
we
do
not
have
to
reach
that
point.
now,
at
124-125
of
the
model
penal
code
comments,
the
ali
advocates
a
very
restrictive
rule
in
perjury
in
the
interrogation
situation,
and
that’s
what
the
government
purports
to
answer
in
its
brief.
it
deals
with
the
question
of
material
omissions
but,
here,
we
have
a
situation
where
the
questioner
doesn’t
get
an
answer
that
purports
to
be
complete
like
the
“who
was
at
the
meeting,
jones
and
smith
and--
jones
and
robertson?”
the
question
is
like
the
analogy
given
in
our
brief.
jones
and
robertson
were
the
only
black
men
at
the
meeting.
the
question
is
if
you
want
to
know
everyone
else
was,
they
were
the
white
men
at
the
meeting.
it’s
only
to
a
class
of
those
within
the
general
question
the
questioner
has
not
put
up,
and
he
should
ask
the
next
question.
if
you
reach
the
question
of
material
omissions,
i
do
submit
that
in
interrogation
the
issue
is
different
than
in
fraud,
but
we
need
not
reach
that.
that,
i
think,
is
important.
mr.
sheldon
h.
elsen
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit.
petitioner
was
convicted
on
one
count
of
perjury
under
the
federal
perjury
statute,
18
usc
1621.
the
appeal
raises
issues
relating
to
the
legal
standards
applicable
under
the
federal
perjury
statute.
the
conviction
was
affirmed
in
a
split
decision
of
the
circuit,
two-to-one.
now,
the
facts
are
quite
simple
and
i
will
put
them
briefly.
the
perjury
arose
out
of
interrogation
in
a
hearing.
the
alleged
perjury,
that
is
the
question.
mr.
sheldon
h.
elsen
the
hearing
was
in
a
bankruptcy
court
before
a
referee
in
bankruptcy.
the
questioning
was
done
by
an
attorney
for
one
of
the
creditors.
the
examination
was
under
section
21
(a).
now,
the
petitioner
had
a
company.
he
was
the
sole
stockholder
and
the
president.
the
company
had
filed
a
petition
under
chapter
11
of
the
bankruptcy
act.
the
purpose
of
the
21
(a)
examination
was
to
inquire
into
assets
of
the
corporation.
because
of
the
petitioner’s
relation
to
the
company
as
president
and
sole
stockholder,
creditors
and
their
counsel
were
entitled,
if
they
so
chose,
to
ask
about
his
personal
assets,
and
there
is
no
dispute
on
that
question.
late
in
the
afternoon
of
the
examination,
four
questions
were
asked
which
are
the
subject
of
this
case.
they
are
set
forth
at
page
3
of
our
brief.
two
commercial
questions
were:
question:
“do
you
have
any
bank
accounts
in
swiss
banks,
mr.
brontson?
answer:
“no,
sir.”
question:
“have
you
ever?”
answer:
“the
company
had
an
account
there
for
about
six
months
in
zurich.”
the
last
two
questions
related
to
nominee
accounts
and
they’re
of
no
further
consequence
here.
the
government
did
not
dispute
the
truthfulness
of
either
of
these
answers.
mr.
bronston
had
had
a
personal
bank
account
in
geneva,
and
the
prosecution
proceeded
on
the
theory
that
he
committed
perjury
by
not
saying
so
in
answer
to
the
second
question,
“have
you
ever?”
now,
it
was
undisputed
that
the
account
had
been
closed
some-two
years
before
the
questioning
took
place
and
that
it
had
been
dormant
for
some-four
years
before
the
questioning
took
place.
there
were
no
assets
in
the
account
and
there
had
not
been
any
assets
beyond
an
insignificant
amount
since
1962,
some-four
years
before
the
questioning,
some-two
years
before
the
company
filed
its
petition
for
an
arrangement.
although
the
accounts
asked
about--
the
account
asked
about
were
in
switzerland,
these
were
not
numbered--
this
was
not
a
numbered
account.
it
was
in
mr.
bronston’s
name.
it
was
opened
in
an
ordinary
commercial
transaction.
his
company
did
business
in
switzerland.
it
was
an
international
company
that
did
business
all
over
the
world.
he
had
a
child
in
a
school
in
switzerland.
he
drew
checks
on
this
account
and
he
signed
them
with
his
name.
mr.
sheldon
h.
elsen
the
time
that
they
chose
to
indict?
mr.
sheldon
h.
elsen
i--
you
mean
whether
the
attorney
for
the
creditor
knew
all
this?
mr.
sheldon
h.
elsen
i
don’t
know
that,
mr.
justice
douglas.
the
government
was
not
a
party
to
the
hearing.
mr.
sheldon
h.
elsen
it
was
a
private
hearing.
mr.
sheldon
h.
elsen
a
creditor
brought
the
information
into
the
government
about
the
bank
account
because
mr.
bronston
had
given
his
creditors
a
general
waiver
that
they
could
go
into
any
bank
account.
the
government
did
not
call
the
man
in
to
explain
it
and
they
simply
indicted.
i
represented
him
at
that
time.
it
is
not
in
the
record,
but
i
can
tell
you.
we
were
never
called
in
to
talk
about
this
case,
and
i
would
suspect
that
there
would--
that
had
this
been
explained
that
there
would
not
have
been
an
indictment
but,
of
course,
that’s
not
a
question
of
law.
mr.
sheldon
h.
elsen
--
you
mean
as
to
the
question
to
the
exercise
of
the
prosecutor
of
discretion?
mr.
chief
justice--
mr.
sheldon
h.
elsen
mr.
chief
justice,
i
would
say
this,
and
i
want
to
answer
your
question
directly.
that
had
the
witness
been
a
candidate
for
high
office
and
had
answered
the
questions
in
this
fashion,
and
if
i
were
sitting
on
a
committee
appraising
it,
i
would
be
troubled
by
this
kind
of
answer
but
i
would
not
have
prosecuted
him
criminally.
mr.
sheldon
h.
elsen
yes.
mr.
sheldon
h.
elsen
no,
i
don’t
say
that
it’s
evasive,
and
i
will
get
into
that.
it
may
have
been
evasive.
mr.
sheldon
h.
elsen
judge
lumbard
proceeded
on
the
assumption
that
the
question
was
not
ambiguous.
if
the
question
was
directed
at
personal
account,
mr.
chief
justice,
then,
of
course,
an
answer
about
the
company’s
account
is
a
patently
unresponsive
answer
and
should’ve
put
the
questioner
on
notice
that
he
had
to
ask
another
question
and
get
an
answer
about
a
personal
account.
judge--
mr.
sheldon
h.
elsen
correct.
that’s
correct.
mr.
sheldon
h.
elsen
if
he
was
interested
in
the
account.
if
he
was
interested
in
the--
in
a
personal
account,
he
should’ve
pursued
this.
he
had
a
question
and
an
answer,
a
truthful
answer
about
the
company.
the
company
was
in
chapter
11,
not
the
individual.
if
indeed
he
were
interested
in
a
personal
account,
he
should’ve
known
that
he
had
not
received
information
about
a
personal
account
and
should’ve
asked
that
next
question,
“what
about
a
personal
account?”
that’s
what
judge
lumbard
said
indeed.
now,
there
are--
just
to--
i
think
i
have
essentially
completed
the
general
picture
of
the
facts
and
i’ve
mentioned
that
the
account
was
uncovered,
not
uncovered
but
the
records
were
procured
by
a
creditor
who
had
been
given,
along
with
the
other
creditor,
the
general
waiver.
now,
there
are
essentially
three
issues,
one
of
which
i
will
not
discuss.
one
of
which--
the
third
being
relating
to
the
evidence,
i
will
not
discuss
that,
but
i
would
like
to
frame
it
and
the
chief
justice
has
perhaps
taken
me
down
that
line,
but
if
i
may
frame
the
issues.
either
the
question
“have
you
ever?”
was
ambiguous,
in
which
case
there
should’ve
been
questioning
to
spell
the
ambiguity
but
there
was
not
perjury.
it
was
ambiguous
because
if
a
company
executive
is
asked
“how
many
cars
did
you
manufactured
in
june,
mr.
ford?”
the
word
“you”
applies
to
a
company,
“how
long
have
you
been
driving?”
applies
to
an
individual.
“do
you
have
any
bank
accounts
in
switzerland
or
have
you
had
any
bank
accounts
in
switzerland?”
could
apply
to
either,
and
this
is
particularly
true
in
a
context
of
an
american
bankruptcy
of
an
international
company
because
the
assets
in
switzerland
or
other
foreign
jurisdictions
would
not
be
under
the
jurisdiction
in
the
american
bankruptcy
court,
and
creditors
may
very
well
have
chosen
to
inquire
into
company
accounts
abroad
so
that
they
might
seek
some
form
of
ansulary
of
bankruptcy.
there
was
indeed
one
in
spain.
a
creditor
may
have
chosen
to
go
into
switzerland,
and
that’s
another
reason,
mr.
chief
justice,
when
i
say
it’s
not
all
that
clear
that
this
was
an
evasive
answer.
judge
lumbard
proceeded
on
the
assumption
that
he
must
have
been
talking
about
a
personal
account,
but
when
you
reflect
upon
the
problems
of
international
bankruptcies
of
companies
with
assets
all
over
the
world,
it’s
not
unreasonable
to
believe
that
the
witness
thought
he
was
being
asked
about
the
company’s
accounts.
he
asked-
he
answered
about
the
company’s
accounts
and
if
the
question
meant
personal,
he
could’ve
said
so.
but,
if
we
assume,
as
judge
lumbard
said,
that
it
was
not
ambiguous
but
was
directed
to
a
personal
account,
then
the
questioner
could
not
have
been
put
off.
it
was
patently
unresponsive.
it
was
about
a
company
account,
and
that
raises
then
the
second
question
of
whether
a
truthful
and
clearly
unresponsive
answer
should
be
the
basis
for
a
criminal
conviction
of
perjury.
now,
there’s
that
second
question
which,
i
think,
raises
the
most
intriguing
conceptual
problems
and
which
the
court
may
very
well
wish
to
ask
more
questions
about,
but
i
have
chosen
to
argue
first
the
question
of
ambiguity
for
the
purpose
of
the
clarity
of
the
argument.
i
think
you
will
find
that
if
we
discuss
that
first
the
whole
discussion
will
proceed
in
a
more
easily
followed
manner.
and,
when
i
begin
the
discussion
of
policy,
i
want
to
come
back
again
to
the
point
i
was
discussing
with
the
chief
justice,
that
is,
this
is
a
criminal
case.
it’s
obvious,
but
it
is
fundamental
here.
there
are--
is
reference
in
some
of
the
briefs
to
the
fact
that
we
want
to
encourage
great
candor
when
we
have
a
person
coming
for
executive
commission
and
judicial
appointment
and
admission
to
the
bar,
and
i
do
not
question
any
of
that.
i
think
that
if
we
were
passing
on
the
admission
of
a
person
to
a
position
of
high
public
trust,
we
would
insist
on
the
absolute
maximum
forthcoming
type
of
candor
and
disclosure,
but
that’s
a
far
cry
from
dealing
with
the
question
of
a
layman
being
asked
questions
by
a
lawyer
who
is
satisfied
with
the
answer,
does
not
go
on
to
ask
the
next
question,
and
to
put
the
layman
in
jail
or
to
brand
him
a
felon
and,
that,
i
submit,
is
the
issue
here.
it’s
obvious
but
it
can’t
be
said
too
often.
that’s
the
issue.
mr.
sheldon
h.
elsen
mr.
justice
white,
the--
mr.
sheldon
h.
elsen
that’s
correct,
although,
mr.
justice
white,
i
would
probably
prefer
to
phrase
it
in
terms
of
the
fact
that
the
case
on
the
evidence
on
the
government’s
evidence
did
not
fall
within
the
standard
which
we
should
set
down
for
a
criminal
case
of
perjury.
mr.
sheldon
h.
elsen
it’s
another
way
of
putting
the
same.
mr.
sheldon
h.
elsen
well--
mr.
sheldon
h.
elsen
we’re
not
raising
that
point
on
this
appeal.
mr.
sheldon
h.
elsen
but,
the
government
did
say
at
one
point
that
the
ambiguity
issue
was
charged
to
the
jury,
and
that’s
not
so.
we’ve
stated--
we’ve
set
forth
the
entire
charge
on
this,
that
the
charge
on
ambiguity
was
specifically
directed
to
the
second
count.
mr.
sheldon
h.
elsen
yes,
that’s
correct.
the--
mr.
sheldon
h.
elsen
the
instructions
were
the
judge
charged
to
the
contrary
of
our
position
on
the
question
of
a
truthful
answer
and
the
jury,
following
that
instruction,
found--
mr.
sheldon
h.
elsen
that’s
correct.
mr.
sheldon
h.
elsen
that’s
correct,
assuming
that
the
elements
were
correctly
stated
by
the
judge.
mr.
sheldon
h.
elsen
never
have
gone
to
the
jury.
they
should’ve
been
dismissed
on
a
motion
at
the
close
of
the
government’s
case
claiming
that
it
should’ve
been
set
aside
the
end
of
the
case.
now,
on
the
question
of
ambiguity,
we
do
have
some
circuit
court
authority
which--
incidentally,
i
might
start
by
saying
that
neither
of
these
issues
seem
to,
before,
have
been
before
this
court.
we
do
have
circuit
court
authority
which
says
that
an
ambiguous
question
should
not
form
a
basis
for
a
charge
of
perjury
where
the
answer
to
one
possible
meaning
is
truthful.
we
have
circuit
court
authority
supporting
lumbard’s
opinion.
mr.
sheldon
h.
elsen
yes?
mr.
sheldon
h.
elsen
that
is
correct.
the
entire
circuit
was
against
us
on
this
question
but
i
think,
in
all
fairness,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
that
the
court
erred
in
that
respect
and
i
urge
that
error
before
this
court.
the--
what--
the
most
thoughtful
study
of
the
whole
perjury
that
we
have
uncovered
is
the
comprehensive
study
of
the
american
law
institute,
which
is
embodied
in
detailed
comments
to
the
draft
of
the
model
penal
code.
that
seems
to
be
the
one
place
where
not
only
the
law
is
explored,
but
a
detailed
and
careful
and--
examination
of
the
rationale
underneath
the
law
is
set
forth.
and,
on
the
question
of
ambiguity,
the
american
law
institute
says,
and
i
want
you
to
find
the
word
“official
interrogation,”
as
they
used
it,
that
means
interrogation
under
the
model
penal
code
before
an
officer,
a
judge,
a
hearing,
a
referee,
and
the
like.
that
is
the
type
of
interrogation
we
had
here.
the
american
law
institute
concluded--
mr.
sheldon
h.
elsen
that’s
at
page
2
of
our
reply
brief,
mr.
justice
powell.
it
does
not
seem
unfair
to
require
official
interrogation
to
be
sufficiently
specific
so
that
the
variety
of
declaring
statements
can
be
measured
against
something
else
than
a
guess
as
to
how
he
interpreted
the
question
against
something
else
than
a
guess.
in
the
sixth
circuit,
in
developing
a
related
rationale
five
years
ago,
said
that
you
cannot
have
a
fair
test
of
the
witness’
belief
in
the
truthfulness
of
his
answer
where
the
question
propounded
admits
of
several
plausible
meaning.
now,
says
the
government,
the
ambiguity
is
eliminated
by
the
question
preceding
the
“have
you
ever?”
because
it
reads
“do
you
have
any
bank
accounts
in
swiss
banks,
mr.
bronston?”
now,
i
would
submit
that
you
could
ask
mr.
ford
“how
many
cars
did
you
manufacture
in
june,
mr.
ford?”
and
that
would
not
make
it
a
question
about
personal
activities.
mr.
sheldon
h.
elsen
what
i
say
the
first
question
is
directed
at
is
bank
accounts.
mr.
sheldon
h.
elsen
and,
bank
accounts
could
be
the
property
of
the
company,
which
was
the
subject
of
the
examination,
mr.
chief
justice--
mr.
sheldon
h.
elsen
or
the
individual.
mr.
sheldon
h.
elsen
yes,
indeed,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
do,
indeed.
this
is
in
a--
mr.
sheldon
h.
elsen
yes,
this
is--
mr.
sheldon
h.
elsen
correct.
mr.
sheldon
h.
elsen
that
is
quite
correct.
that
is
the
funda--
the
major
premise
of
the
entire
ambiguity.
mr.
sheldon
h.
elsen
the
corporation
no
longer
had
a
bank
account.
mr.
sheldon
h.
elsen
he
no
longer--
mr.
sheldon
h.
elsen
that’s
quite
correct.
mr.
sheldon
h.
elsen
that
was
truthful,
but
it
also
does
not
establish
a
context
of
inquiry
to
personal
bank
accounts.
i
think
i
have
suggested
in
my
opening
remarks
why
it
is
that
the
witness
could
reasonably
have
reached
this
conclusion.
mr.
sheldon
h.
elsen
yes.
mr.
sheldon
h.
elsen
i
don’t
believe
that
i
have
to
go
that
far,
mr.
justice
brennan.
mr.
sheldon
h.
elsen
well,
companies
could
have
nominees.
mr.
sheldon
h.
elsen
as
a
matter
of
fact,
it’s
a
common
practice
of
foreign
corporations
to
use
nominees
in
swiss
banks
in
order
to
open
up
the--
an
account
without
having
to
comply
with
swiss
banking
law
for
corporate
resolutions
and
the
like.
it
gets
rather
intricate.
they
often
use
individuals
for
that
purpose,
so
that
that
very
well
could
have
been.
the
point
is
we
were
dealing
with
an
intricate
situation
and
that
if
the--
and
the
witness
may
have
thought
one
thing.
he
may
have
thought
the
other.
the
point
is,
before
we
make
this
perjury,
we
should
not
have
to
guess.
it’s
not
fair,
but
that’s--
mr.
sheldon
h.
elsen
at
the
trial?
mr.
sheldon
h.
elsen
he
did
not
take
the
stand.
mr.
sheldon
h.
elsen
he
did
not
take
the
stand.
there
were
witnesses
from
the
company
who
had
testified
that
the
account
had
not
been
kept
secret.
there
was
nothing
that
the
petitioner
had
to
add
to
that.
there
was
no
case
but
the
fact
that
there
was
an
account,
which
he
conceded
at
all
times.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
swiss
bank
officer
who
testified
for
the
government
testified
under--
with
mr.
bronston’s
permission,
which
we
sent
to
switzerland
because
of
the
requirements
of
the
swiss
banking
laws.
so,
there
was
no
dispute
about
the
fact
of
this
account.
the
question
was
what
was
going
on
during
the
interrogation.
now,
i
turn
to
the
other
horn
of
the
issue.
the
question
which
starts
with
the
assumption,
which
i
submit
is
really
unrealistic
here
but,
it
starts
with
the
assumption
that
the
inquiry
was
clearly
and
unambiguously
addressed
to
a
personal
account
and,
in
that
context,
we
have
an
unresponsive
answer
which
the
government--
which
the
creditor’s
lawyer
could
readily
have
cured
by
asking
a
question,
“have
you
personally
ever
had
any
swiss
bank
accounts?”
he
could’ve
insisted
easily
on
a
responsive
answer
if
he
wanted
one.
the
referee
was
right
there.
the
witness
would’ve
had
to
answer
the
questions
if
the
lawyer
had
wanted
to
ask
them.
mr.
sheldon
h.
elsen
oh,
yes.
i
think
the
referee
has
to
invoke
the
aid
of
the
district
court,
but
there’s--
mr.
sheldon
h.
elsen
he
did
direct
it,
yes.
the
referee
was
directing
“you
answer
that
question.”
mr.
sheldon
h.
elsen
i
believe
that’s
the
law,
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
but,
nevertheless,
may
i
say
that
the
atmosphere
of
the
referee’s
court
was
a
courtroom
and
the
obdurate
witness
is
a
rare
sight,
a
rara
avis
indeed
who
will
quarrel
with
a
referee
sitting
on
the
bench,
and
i
might
also
point
out
that
the
right
of
counsel
is
not
generally
recognized.
the
witness
doesn’t--
he
does
not
have
a
lawyer,
has
the
right
to
get
up
and
say
“i
object.”
the
witness
is
on
his
own.
now,
there
was
a
lawyer
sitting
there
for
part
of
the
hearing,
but
the
referee
made
it
clear
what
the
practice
is
in
the
bankruptcy
court.
we
do
not
make
an
issue
of
this
point
because
i
think
that
there
is
a--
the
issue
that
we
raise
here
has
to
do
with
the
interrogation,
but
that
is
part
of
the
set.
mr.
sheldon
h.
elsen
why
do
we
concede
materiality?
mr.
sheldon
h.
elsen
that’s
really--
we
concede
materiality
because
the
law
is
extensive
that,
in
a
bankruptcy,
we
will
not
dispute
the
fact
that
you
could’ve
asked
about--
just
about
anything
that
he
had
done
during
a
period.
mr.
sheldon
h.
elsen
no.
there
wasn’t
a
nickel
to
be
had
or
the
estate
in
any
way
to
be
affected
by
the
answer
to
a
question
about
the
person--
about
this
personal
bank
account,
and
no
one
has
ever
taken
any
action
as
a
result
of
the
disclosure
of
the
transcript
of
this
account
which
was
procured
in
response
to
his
way
over
bank
secrecy,
so
that,
it
has
had
no
effect
but
we
have
not
argued
the
question
of
materiality
simply
because
of
a
law
in
this
area.
it
is
against
us
and--
on
that
question,
and
we
do
not
dispute
it.
now,
i
would
like
to
point
out,
before
i
sit
down,
the
broad
sweep
of
a
rule
that
would
permit
a
criminal
conviction
for
a
truthful
but
non-responsive
answer
because
the
non-responsive
question
occurs
every
day
in
the
law
with
the
most
honest
witness
who
is
being
examined.
in
pretrial
depositions,
the
witness
who
does
not
want
to
volunteer
about
his
other
business
affairs,
about
his
friends’
lives,
about
his
private
life
and
who
will
wait
until
he
is
pushed,
that
witness
comes
up
all
the
time.
now
you
may
say,
in
a
pure
platonic
society,
maybe
we
shouldn’t
be
that
way,
but
that’s
the
way
the
real
world
is
and
i
think
that
we
all
know
that
from
our
experience
at
the
bar.
this
goes
on
constantly,
and
witnesses
sometimes
don’t
know
why
the
lawyer
doesn’t
presume
the
witness--
the
lawyer
may
shift
his
interest.
he
may
decide
to
use
a
different
line
of
inquiry
or
he
has
what
he
wants
and
doesn’t
want
to
get
into
a
dispute
over
a
point
he
doesn’t
want
to
go
to
court
to
get
a
ruling.
so,
he
lets
the
matter
drop,
but
if
it--
the
rule
is
that
a
truthful
but
unresponsive
answer
constitutes
perjury.
every
time
the
questioner
leaves
the
unresponsive
answer
on
the
question,
you
have
a
prima
facie
case
of
perjury.
now,
that
is
the
most
disturbing
aspect
of
this
entire
case
mr.
sheldon
h.
elsen
i
would
not
concede
that,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
but
i
would
draw
this
distinction
and
the
ali
draws
this.
in
a
civil
fraud
action,
the
actor,
the
person
making
the
statement,
controls
the
framing
of
the
representations.
he
can--
if
i’m
selling
you
stock
and
i,
say,
give
you
a
perspective,
you
cannot
ask
me
the
next
question.
mr.
sheldon
h.
elsen
well,
the
normal
civil
fraud
situation
arises
out
of
representations
where
the
actor
controls
the
representations,
and
the
american
law
institute
in
the
model
penal
code
does
say
that
there
should
be
a
stricter
standard
for
that
type
of
situation
than
for
the
interrogation
situation
where
counsel
was
in
the
position
to
frame
the
issues,
to
ask
the
next
question,
and
to
pursue
and
i
would
say,
though
i
certainly
do
not
say
that
this
is
a
fraud
particularly
in
the
light
of
the
nature
of
the
questioning
here
and
the
nature
of
the
economic
interests
that
were
involved
here
where
there
was
indeed
no
motive.
that
if
we
assume
all
those
things
that
i
have
assumed
to
reach
this
point
of
the
discussion,
nevertheless,
a
truthful
and
unresponsive
answer
cut
so
broadly
that
it
would
either--
a
rule
of
this
would
either
be
unenforced
thus
inviting
disrespect
for
the
law,
or
it
would
be
enforced
most
frequently
against
those
in
disfavor.
now,
the
model
penal
code
deals
with
an
analogous
issue.
it
is
not
an
identical
issue,
but
it
raises
the
same
policy
problems.
in
a
treatment
of
the
remington
type
problem,
the
ca--
the
problem
arising
from
the
united
states
versus
remington
where
the
ali
says
the
likelihood
of
achieving
moral
reformation
by
imprisoning
one
who
has
objectively
told
the
truth
is
not
high.
encouraging
the
police
to
inquire
as
to
subjective
dishonesty
behind
the
objective
truth
would
not
only
waste
their
time,
but
open
substantial
possibility
of
abuse.
now,
i
see--
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time
for
rebuttal,
but
i
would
like
to
simply
make
one
point.
mr.
sheldon
h.
elsen
well,
then
i
will
simply
say
this.
this
is
not
a
case
involving
material
omissions
either,
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
we
do
not
have
to
reach
that
point.
now,
at
124-125
of
the
model
penal
code
comments,
the
ali
advocates
a
very
restrictive
rule
in
perjury
in
the
interrogation
situation,
and
that’s
what
the
government
purports
to
answer
in
its
brief.
it
deals
with
the
question
of
material
omissions
but,
here,
we
have
a
situation
where
the
questioner
doesn’t
get
an
answer
that
purports
to
be
complete
like
the
“who
was
at
the
meeting,
jones
and
smith
and--
jones
and
robertson?”
the
question
is
like
the
analogy
given
in
our
brief.
jones
and
robertson
were
the
only
black
men
at
the
meeting.
the
question
is
if
you
want
to
know
everyone
else
was,
they
were
the
white
men
at
the
meeting.
it’s
only
to
a
class
of
those
within
the
general
question
the
questioner
has
not
put
up,
and
he
should
ask
the
next
question.
if
you
reach
the
question
of
material
omissions,
i
do
submit
that
in
interrogation
the
issue
is
different
than
in
fraud,
but
we
need
not
reach
that.
that,
i
think,
is
important.
