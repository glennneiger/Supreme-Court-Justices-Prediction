justice
byron
r.
white
well,
there’s
no
question
the
jury
found
that
he
knew
he
was
telling
a
falsehood
or
answering
the
question
falsely.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
is
it
your
point
that
even
if
the
jury
found
that
as
like
any
other
case
where
there
shouldn’t
have
been--
there
wasn’t
enough
evidence
to
go
to
the
jury?
justice
byron
r.
white
nevertheless--
justice
byron
r.
white
nevertheless,
the
jury--
you
don’t
take
any
exception
to
the
form
of
the
instructions
to
the
jury.
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
no,
you
don’t.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
constructions
are--
seem
to
appear
to
be
wholly
consistent
with
the
statute,
and
they
inquire
the
jury
to
find
the
elements
of
the
offense
under
the
statute.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
jury
found
them.
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
the
jury
found
the
elements
of
the
offense
or
they
wouldn’t
have--
justice
byron
r.
white
assuming
they
followed
the--
justice
byron
r.
white
but
your
point,
nevertheless,
is
that
the
case
should
never
have
gone
to
the
jury
on
these
facts.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that’s
no--
really
no
final
answer,
is
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
jury
finds
lots
of
things.
other
juries
are
pretty
upset,
aren’t
they?
justice
byron
r.
white
even
though
the
instructions
were
proper.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it
was,
wasn’t
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
what’s
part
of
his
argument,
i
take
it,
is
that
even
if
the
witness
clearly
understood
it,
all
they
did
was
penciled
the
lawyer.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
sense
that
there
on--
a
lot
of
witnesses
are
just
not
quick
as
some
lawyers.
they
don’t
know
where
the
lawyer
is
going
with
questions.
all
the
questions
that
they
can
avoid
answering,
they’ve
tried
to
avoid
answering.
and
so,
he
said
“well,
my
mother
had
an
account,”
“my
company
did.”
he
just
didn’t
answer
the
question.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
your
argument
has
to
be
that
anytime
somebody
gives
an
evasive
answer,
a
jury
is
entitled
to
find
that
by
negative--that
the
negative
implication
was
that
he
really
intended
to
answer
the
question
falsely.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it
does
if
you--
anytime
the
jury
found
it,
you
would
sustain
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
no,
but
if
he
went
to
the
jury
and
the
jury
found
that,
what
would
you
say?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
that
excuse
is
pretty
easily--
what
they’re
going
to
do--
not
going
to
ask
another
question.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know,
but
it’s--
it
didn’t--
you
don’t
have
to
know
that
to
wonder
why
the
lawyer
didn’t
ask
another
question
at
the
time.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that’s
what
you
say
but
it
may
be
quite
true
that
he
had
thoroughly
intended
to
conceal
the
fact
that
was
asked.
you
wouldn’t
say
that’s
equivalent
to--
if
he
successfully
conceals
it,
is
that
equivalent
to
perjury?
justice
byron
r.
white
they
may
not
be
free
to
do
that.
that
doesn’t
mean
they’re
guilty
of
perjury
every
time
they
do
it.
they’ll
now
be
free
to
do
it
in
the
sense
that
the
lawyer
can
ask
another
question.
if
they
refuse
to
answer,
they’ll
go
to
jail.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it
wouldn’t
take
much
in
this
case,
would
it?
justice
byron

the

must
have
found
that,
