justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
guess
you
say
that
because
of
the
context--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
how
the
inquiry
in
the
bankruptcy
proceeding
involving
the
corporation.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that’s
the
premise.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
what
do
you
say
the
fact
was?
the
fact
was,
at
the
time
this
question
was
asked
the
corporation
no
longer
had
a
bank
account.
is
that
right?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
did
he,
at
the
time--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
at
the
time--
so,
whether
he
took
it
as
addressed
to
him
personally
or
is
it--
or
“you”
meaning
the
corporation,
in
either
instance,
the
fact
was
that
neither
had
a
bank
account
at
that
time.
is
that
right?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so,
that
was
truthful
and
that
was--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
may
i
ask,
mr.
elsen?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
would
you
say
that--
i
gather
your
basic
premise
is
that,
in
this
series
of
questions,
whenever
the
interrogator
uses
the
word
“you,”
the
interrogator
thought
to
be
that
mr.
bronston
understood
“you”
to
be
the
corporation.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
see,
because
i
was
wondering
about
the
last
question
“have
you
any
nominees?”
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
they
have
nominees,
too?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
he
took
the
stand,
didn’t
he?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
he
did
not?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
was
the
significance
of
whether
or
not
he
personally
had
a
bank
account,
what
you
say,
four
years
earlier
or
something?
what
was
the
significance
of
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
mean,
was
the
estate
in
any
way
disadvantaged?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
at
that
point,
mr.
frey,
what
could
he
possibly
have
gained
by
the
type
of
answer
he
gave
if
it
were
perjurious?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
i
gather,
mr.
frey,
that
certainly
this
bankruptcy
estate
suffered
not
at
all
about
anything
that
he
said.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
thought
all
of
the
facts
regarding
those
accounts:
what
was
in
them,
how
long
have
they
been
opened,
when
they
were
closed,
that
they
all
will
finally
be
developed
at
the
perjury
trial.
am
i
wrong
with
that,
both
as
to
the
corporate
and
personal
accounts?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
bankruptcy
cases,
when--
or
some
thought
perjury
has
occurred,
when--
who
makes
the
decision
to
prosecute?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
this
isn’t
something
that
has
to
come
to
the
department
of
justice?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
guess
you
say
that
because
of
the
context--

j.
brennan,
jr.
how
the
inquiry
in
the
bankruptcy

justice
william
j.
brennan,

that’s
the
premise.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
what
do
you
say
the
fact
was?
the
fact
was,
at
the

this
question
was
asked
the
corporation
no
longer
had
a
bank
account.
is
that
right?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
did
he,
at
the
time--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
at
the
time--
so,
whether
he
took
it
as
addressed
to
him
personally
or
is
it--
or
“you”
meaning
the
corporation,
in
either
instance,

fact
was
that
neither

at

is

that
was
truthful
and
that
was--

may
i

mr.
