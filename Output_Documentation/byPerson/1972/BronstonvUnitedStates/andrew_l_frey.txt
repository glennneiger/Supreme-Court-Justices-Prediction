mr.
andrew
l.
frey
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
central
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
a
witness
who
knowingly,
willfully,
and
with
the
intent
to
deceive
and
conceal
give
sworn
testimony
which,
considered
in
the
context
in
which
it
was
given,
constitutes
a
falsehood
by
implication
can
escape
punishment
for
perjury
on
the
ground
that
the
words
that
he
uttered
were
literally
or
technically
truthful
when
considered
in
isolation.
now,
i’d
like
to
begin
with
what
the
jury
necessarily
found
when
it
convicted
petitioner
in
this
case.
judge
taney’s
charge
to
the
jury
was,
we
believe,
a
model
of
clarity
and
of
precision,
and
we
have
set
forth
the
relevant
portions
of
it
in
appendix
b
to
our
brief.
judge
taney
made
it
quite
clear
to
the
jury
that
they
had
to
find
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
that
the
petitioner
understood
the
question,
that
his
response
to
the
question
was
not
inaccurate
as
a
result
of
haste,
inadvertence,
misunderstanding,
confusion,
negligence,
or
any
honest
error
on
his
part.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
yes,
i
think
that
this--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
i
think
that’s
true.
we
don’t
have
to
read
that
in
as
a
matter
of
law
because
this
is
an
issue
that,
as
i’m
trying
to
point
out
here,
the
jury
did
resolve.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
yes,
i
do
agree,
your
honor.
when--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
that’s
what
the
jury
found,
because
the
judge
instructed
them
apart
from
the
question
of
understanding
that
they
must
find
that
he
made
a
statement
which,
when
considered
in
the
entire
context,
was
a
false
statement.
and,
he
further
instructed
that
they
must
find
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
that
he
made
the
statement
with
an
intent
to
deceive.
so
that,
when
the
jury
convicted
petitioner,
the
jury
necessarily
found
that
he
understood
the
question
and
they
necessarily
found
that
his
statement,
“the
company
had
an
account
in
zurich
for
about
six
months,”
was
of
the
same
effect
and
had
the
same
meaning
in
the
context
as
if
he
had
said
the
company
had
an
account
in
zurich
for
about
six
months
and
there
were
no
other
accounts.
that’s
what
the
jury
found.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
there
is
a
question
of
course
as
to
whether
the
jury
could
properly
find
that
under
the
evidence
in
the--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
that’s
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
that
may
be
true
if
an
error
is--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
yes,
if
there’s
an
error
in
submitting
the
case
to
the
jury.
we
don’t
believe
there
was
such
an
error
in
this
case.
basically,
petitioner’s
arguments
fall
into
two
categories.
the
one
group
of
arguments
for
those
that
say
the
case
should
never
have
gone
to
the
jury.
the
second
group
are
those
that
say
all
of
these
may
be
true,
what
the
jury
found
may
be
true.
it
may
be
true
that
this
was
a
lie
by
negative
implication,
but
that’s
not
enough
as
a
matter
of
law,
and
the
judge
was
in
error
when
he
charged
that
technical
truthfulness
is
not
sufficient.
i’d
like
to
take
up
first
the
ambiguity
point
that
mr.
elsen
discussed,
which
is
basically
a
question
of
whether
it
was
proper
to
submit
this
issue
to
the
jury.
now,
i
point
out
that,
in
addition
to
the
jury,
none
of
the
judges
below
had
the
least
difficulty
with
this
contention.
they
were
all
satisfied
that
the
word
“you,”
as
used
in
the
context
of
these
questions,
at
least
called
for
information
about
petitioner’s
personal
accounts.
now
in
our
view,
looking
at
the
context
of
the
proceeding,
it
was
logical
to
assume
that
it
called
for
information
about
both
personal
and
corporate
accounts.
but,
in
any
event,
we
do
not
believe
that
it
can
be
construed
as
calling
for
information
only
about
his
corporate
accounts.
i
think,
perhaps
i
can
illustrate
that
point
for
you
by
hypothetical.
suppose
the
company
had
had
no
accounts
in
switzerland
at
any
time.
there
had
been
only
petitioner’s
personal
account,
and
he
had
been
asked
these
very
questions
that
he
was
asked.
and,
in
response
to
the
question
“have
you
ever
had
a
swiss
bank
account?”
he
had
simply
answered
no.
now,
i
don’t
think
it
could
seriously
be
contended
that
that
response
would’ve
been
non-perjurious
in
view
of
the
existence
of
his
personal
geneva
account.
yet,
if
the
ambiguity
argument,
as
a
matter
of
law,
holds
water
then
that
response--
the
question
was
still
unambiguous.
you
couldn’t
go
to
the
jury
even
if
he
had
said
no
in
those
circumstances.
and,
i
think
if
you
look
at
the
context
of
this
proceeding
and
of
the
questions,
there
was
evidence
from
which
the
jury
could
reasonably
infer
that
the
word
“you”
referred
to
petitioner’s
personal
accounts.
first
of
all,
there’s
the
word
in
even
the
question
itself.
in
normal
meaning
of
those
questions,
it
seems
to
me,
is
that
“you”
is
“you,
mr.
bronston.”
now,
petitioner
says
“well,
but
this
was
a
bankruptcy
arrangement
proceeding
for
mr.
bronston’s
onus
corporation.”
that’s
true.
however,
the
nature
of
this
proceeding
is
one
in
which
the
creditors
are
trying
to
discover
in
marshal
the
assets
of
the
company
in
order
to
be
sure
that
the
creditors’
claims
are
going
to
be
satisfied
that
there’s
been
no
improper
diversion
of
company
assets
into
friends
or
into
the
personal
hands
of
the
whole--
sole
owner
of
the
company.
so,
it’s
highly
material.
it’s
not
just
material
as
a
technical
matter,
but
it’s
highly
material
to
the
bankruptcy
inquiry
to
determine
petitioner’s
individual
finances
to
see
whether
there
is
money
that
is
in
his
personal
possession
which
properly
belongs
to
the
corporation
and
should
be
reachable
by
the
creditors
as
part
of
the
arrangement.
now,
the
evidence--
in
this
case,
the
account
had
been
closed
and
it
has
never
been
established
that
there
was
bankruptcy
fraud
by
petitioner.
however,
on
the--in
the
setting
of
this
situation,
i
think
it’s
quite
clear
that
the
questions
were
addressed
to
his
personal
account.
now,
one
other
point
in
this
connection--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
first
of
all,
he
deflected
inquiry
into
this
account
within--
through
which
$180,000
have
passed
which
he
used
for
mixed
business
and
personal
purposes
according
to
the
testimony
at
the
trial
in
the
perjury
case.
i
can’t
tell
you
what
specifically
he
would’ve
gained.
what
i
can
tell
you
is
that
it’s
possible
that
either
there
were
or
he
though
there
were
some
improprieties
in
that
personal
account
which
would’ve
been
revealed--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
it
hasn’t
been
proved
that
he
suffered
by
it.
the
fact
is
that
no
inquiry
was
made
to
the
geneva
account.
had
he
mentioned
the
geneva
account,
i
think
it’s
quite
clear
that
an
investigation
about--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
the
personal
account
ledger
was
introduced
and
there
was
evidence
regarding
some
of
the
transactions.
there
was
some
evidence
that
the
government
sought
to
introduce
regarding
an
unexplained
series
of
transactions
involving
a
$25-payment
from
the
company
to
lichtenstein
corporation
or
the
dorchester
establishment
which,
five
weeks
after,
paid
$20,000
into
this
personal
geneva
account.
now,
that
evidence
was
introduced
and
was
before
the
jury
when
mr.
elsen
sought
to
rebut
that
evidence
by
putting
an
explanatory
evidence.
there
was
a
conference
at
the
bench.
as
a
result
of
which,
the
matter
was
dropped
and
the
government
did
not
argue
to
the
jury,
and
i
can’t
say
to
you
that
there
was
any
impropriety
in
this
transaction,
but
what
i
can
say
is
that
it’s
very
possible
that
mr.
bronston
thought
there
was
something
about
that
account
that
he
didn’t
want
these
people
snooping
into.
there
was
a
substantial
account,
$180,000.
even
though
it
was
closed
now,
assets
can
be
traced
from
account
to
account.
now,
we
will
agree
that
there
are
circumstances
in
which
a
question
can
be
so
ambiguous
that,
as
a
matter
of
law,
you
can’t
ask
the
jury
to
find
whether
the
defendant
understood
the
question.
an
example
of
that
would
be
the
latamore
case
where
he
was
asked
if
he
was
a
follower
of
the
communist
law
and,
in
reversing
his
perjury
conviction,
it
was
stated
properly,
i
believe,
that
the
jury
shouldn’t
be
allowed
to
speculate
on
what
such
a
vague
term
may
mean.
in
the
cobert
case,
he
was
asked
about
a
listing
post
and
the
indictment
didn’t
indicate
what
a
listing
post
was
or
that
he
had
any
understanding
of
what
a
listing
post
was.
we
don’t
have
that
kind
of
a
problem
here.
everybody
knows
what
a
bank
account
is.
now,
i
think
we
know
what
“you”
is.
it’s
not--
it
doesn’t
suffer
from
that
kind
of
ambiguity.
finally,
the
point
that
i
think
you
brought
out
earlier,
mr.
justice
white,
petitioner’s
argument
is
completely
theoretical.
he
is
saying
this
is
ambiguous
as
a
matter
of
law.
he
never
got
up
on
the
stand
and
said
i
didn’t
understand
the
question.
at
no
point
has
he
introduced
evidence
to
that
effect.
we’re
dealing--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
no,
i
don’t
believe
my
argument
has
to
be
that
at
all.
i’ll
turn
to
that
point
now.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
no,
i
would
not.
i
mean,
let’s
take
judge
lumbard’s
example
in
his
dissenting
opinion,
he
says
suppose
petitioner
had
answered
the
question
by
saying
“my
daughter
went
to
school
in
switzerland.”
well,
he
says
this
is
an
unresponsive
answer.
he
says
it’s
very
similar
to
the
answer
he
gave,
at
least
in
the
chain
the
difference
is
a
matter
of
degree.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
no,
i
would
say
it
could
not
go
to
the
jury
in
that
case,
and
the
reason
it
could
not
go
to
the
jury
is
that
the
answer
“my
daughter
went
to
school
in
switzerland”
does
not
contain
any
implication
about
bank
accounts
one
way
or
another.
it
cannot
be
understood
to
be
a
denial
of
the
existence
of
any
bank
accounts,
but
the
answer
“the
company
had
an
account
in
zurich
for
about
six
months”
can
be
understood
and
the
jury
took
it
to
mean
that
was
the
only
account.
they
were
no
other
accounts,
and
our
case
does
depend
upon
that
implication
that
we
say
the
jury
could
properly
find
was
in
here
and
in
his
answer.
but,
not
just
any
unresponsive
answer
is--
would
expose
the
witness
to
perjury.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
yes,
indeed,
by--
if
your
statement
contains
with
it
an
implication,
as
many
statements
do.
the
question
is
what
did
you
intend
to
convey
and
what
did
you
convey?
the
question
is
should
we
look
just
at
the
literal
word,
should
we
pars
them
as
narrowly
as
possible,
or
should
we
look
at
the
meaning?
may
the
jury
say
“yes,
in
this
context,
we
find
that
when
he
said
these
words
he
meant
to
deny
the
existence
of
the
geneva
account”
because
that
is
what
they
found,
and
we
say
that
if
that’s
the
meaning,
even
though
the
meaning
is
not
part
of
the
literal
technical
parceling
of
his
dry
words,
he
still
can
be
held
accountable
for
that
mistake.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
they
were
asked
by
counsel
for
one
of
the
principal
creditors
of
the
corporation.
now,
we
believe
that
the
position
the
petitioner
has
taken
is
directly
contrary
to
the
basic
purpose
of
the
perjury
statute
which
has,
as
a
central
concern,
protecting
the
integrity
of
the
fact-finding
process.
they
dismissed
and
judge
lumbard
dismissed--
dismisses
the
factor
that
the
inquiry
is
frustrated
and
misled
as
being
not
material,
but
we
think
it’s
the
very
evil
of
which
the
perjury
statute
is
really
aimed.
now--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
it’s
easy
for
us
to
stand
here
now
knowing
about
the
existence
of
the
geneva
account
and
looking
back
at
the
matter.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
because
i
think
the
lawyer
understood
petitioner’s
answer,
the
way
the
jury
understood
petitioner’s
answer,
to
deny
the
geneva
account
and,
therefore,
was
fruitless
to
ask
another
question.
he
already
had
the
information
he
was
seeking.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
i
don’t
believe
that’s
so.
we
were
dealing
here
with
a
very
experienced
and
capable
new
york
lawyer
who
did
not
ask
the
next
question.
now,
i
can’t
say
why
he
didn’t
ask
the
next
question,
but
it
does
seem
to
me
that
he
had
an
answer
which
seemed
to
answer
his
question
in
its
entirety.
that
is,
the
answer
the
company
had
an
account
in
zurich
for
about
six
months
suggest
that
that
was
the
only
bank
account
that
existed.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
i
think
the
united
states
attorney
would
make
this
decision.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
i’m
not
certain
of
that.
i’m
not
certain.
in
this
case,
i
believe
the
information
was
provided
by
the
creditor
whose
attorney
had
been
asking
the
questioning
to
the
united
states
attorney.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
that
is
true.
in
fact,
the--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
this
wasn’t
just
any
line
of
questioning,
mr.
justice
marshall.
this
was
questioning
that
was
going
to
something
which
was--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
now,
that’s
true.
he
could
certainly
have
asked.
he
could’ve
repeated
the
question
with
a
different
wording.
he
could’ve
said
“yes,
what
about
your
personal
accounts?
did
you
have
any
of
those?”
he
could’ve
done
that.
there’s
no
question.
the
questioning
that
immediately
preceded
the
swiss
bank
account
questioning
concerned
mrs.
bronston’s
jewelry.
clearly,
a
personal
matter,
and
immediately
following
that
into
the
swiss
bank
account
questions.
now,
we
think
that
while
the
policies
are
not
the
same
where
you’re
dealing
with
criminal
fraud
or
extortion,
there
is
a
general
principle
of
american
jurisprudence
that
you
look
at
statements
in
the
context
in
which
they
are
uttered.
you
give
them
the
meaning
that
the
context
suggests
that
they
convey.
you
don’t
look
at
them
strictly
in
terms
of
the
literal
words,
and
we
think
the
same
policy
ought
to
apply
in
the
perjury
area
as
it
applies
in
civil
areas
and
other
areas
with
criminal
utterance.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
i
think
if
this
were
a
criminal
fraud
case
it
would
also
be
true
that
you
will
look
at
the
context
of
the
statement,
and
we
have
cited
cases
in
our
brief
to
that
effect.
it’s
true--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
no,
i’m
not
suggesting
that
automatically
the
same
policy
would
apply
to
perjury.
there
are
different
considerations,
but
i
am
saying
that
what
the
dissent
in
the
court
of
appeals
proposed
was
that
we
simply
look
at
the
words
in
isolation
from
the
context
in
which
they
were
spoken.
if
those
words
are
literally
true,
the
inquiry
is
at
an
end.
now,
i’d
like
to
touch
briefly
on
the
hypotheticals
which
we,
in
our
brief,
and
petitioner,
in
his
reply
brief,
have
brought
out.
i
think
that
one
can
readily
see
that
literal
truthfulness
should
not
be
a
total
defense
to
a
perjury
charge.
from
the
example
of
the
question
“who
was
at
the
meeting
of
june
1?”
and
the
response
“smith
and
brown,”
when
in
fact,
jones
and
robinson
were
also
at
the
meeting,
now,
the
response
“smith
and
brown”
is
literally
truthful.
you
could’ve
of
course
asked
another
question,
“anyone
else?”
but,
the
response
“smith
and
brown”
in
the
context
can
suggest
that
that’s
a
total
answer.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
you
could
do
that.
that’s
right,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
and
i
think
that
i
will
concede
that
the
inquiry
here
was
not
the
most
skillful
that
one
can
imagine,
but
the
question
is
whether
the
witness
who
has
spoken
falsely
should
be
relieved
of
the
onus
of
his
offense
by
virtue
of
the
inaptitude
of
counsel
asking
the
questions.
this
witness
understood
what
the
question
called
for.
he
gave
an
answer
which
was
designed
to
and
which
did
convey
false
information,
denying
the
existence
of
a
swiss
bank
account.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
it
depends
on
how
he
does
it
of
course,
and
only
if
he
conceals
it
by
a
false
statement
would
it
be
perjury.
but,
our
contention
is
that
that
is
what
he
did.
he
could
simply
have
answered
the
question
“yes.”
i
mean,
that
would’ve
been
a
completely
satisfactory
and
non-perjurious
answer
and
would’ve
put
the
ball
back
in
the
court
of
the
person
asking
the
questions.
instead,
he
chose
to
answer
in
a
manner
which
applied
the
non-existence
of
this
personal
geneva
account.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
you
think
petitioner
wasn’t
thinking
about
it?
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
that’s
probably
true,
he
wasn’t--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
that’s
true,
but
he--
here,
he
was
dealing
with
a
witness
who
had
come
in,
as
an
effect,
a
plaintiff
asking
relief
of
the
court
for
his
cooperation,
asking
the
bankruptcy
court
and
asking
his
creditors
to
participate
in
arrangement.
he
was
dealing
with
a
witness
who
had
unique
possession
of
the
information
that
was
necessary
to
be
developed
for
the
sake
of
assuring
that
the
arrangement
that
would
be
arrived
at
would
be
fair
to
the
creditors.
the
lawyer,
since
this
was
a
discovery
type
of
proceeding,
he
didn’t
already
have
this
information.
he
didn’t
know
the
answers.
he
didn’t
know
about
the
existence
of
any
swiss
bank
accounts
one
way
or
the
other.
this
was
information
that
mr.
bronston
knew
of,
and
mr.
bronston
was,
therefore,
in
a
position
where
he
could
much
more
easily
mislead
the
inquiry
than
you
would
be
at
a
trial
where
of
course,
in
many
cases,
the
lawyers
already
know
the
information
and
their
problem
is
to
bring
it,
develop
it
for
the
fact-finder.
here,
you
have
a
discovery
proceeding
and
the
court
of
appeals
in
their
opinion
emphasized
the
particular
importance.
it
would
also
be
important
in
grand
jury
proceedings
which
are
discovery
proceedings
in
the
criminal
area.
a
witness
is
to
be
free
to
give
any
kind
of
answer
so
long
as
it’s
literally
truthful
no
matter
how
misleading
it
is,
no
matter
what
implications
it
carries,
no
matter
to
what
extent
it
deflects
the
grand
jury’s
inquiry.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
if
the
lawyer
sees
that
he’
been--
that
he
is
or
may
have
been
lied
to.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
i
think
that,
again,
i
have
to
come
back
to
what
i
think
the--
what
the
jury
found
petitioner’s
statement
to
mean
which
was
that
he
had
already
denied
the
existence
of
this
account.
i
mean,
in
my
example
with--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
in
my
example
with
the
persons
at
the
meeting
where
the
answer
“smith
and
brown,”
which
i
believe
petitioner
concedes
as
perjurious
in
that
context,
although
i
think
judge
lumbard
would
not
find
it
to
be,
you
would
agree
that
all
you
have
to
do
is
ask
anyone
else
and
you
could’ve
bring
out
the
rest
of
that
information.
yet,
the
answer
suggests
no
one
else,
and
if
the
answer
stands,
no
one
else
is
the
answer
to
which
the
witness
is
held.
now,
the
difference
in
the
example
the
petitioner
has
used
in
his
reply
brief
is,
he
says
that
if
the
answer
had
been
“smith
and
jones
were
the
blacks
at
the
meeting,”
that
would
not
be
perjurious.
we
agree
that
will
not
be
perjurious.
the
example
is
inapt,
however,
for
the
reason
that
the
statement
“smith
and
jones
were
the
blacks
at
the
meeting”
carries
with
it
no
implication
denying
presence
of
other
persons
at
the
meeting.
on
the
contrary,
it
implies
that
there
were
other
people
at
the
meeting.
now,
if
this
answer
had
implied
that
there
were
other
bank
accounts,
we
wouldn’t
be
here
today
because
we
would
agree
that
there
would
be
no
perjury
charge
to
submit
to
the
jury.
if
this
answer
had
been
completely
unresponsive
like
the
daughter
going
to
school
in
switzerland,
there
would
be
no
negative
implication,
no
false
statement
contained.
now,
there’s
one
matter
that
i
would
like
to
call
to
the
court’s
attention
that
has
come
to
our
attention
in
the
course
of
preparing
for
the
argument.
the
opinion
of
the
second
circuit
speaks
about
the
whole
truth
principle
of
the
oath
and,
in
a
footnote,
they
stated
“it
may
be
the
duce
from
these
orders
and
forms
in
the
purposes
of
the
act
that
an
oath
given
in
a
bankruptcy
proceeding
basically
takes
the
same
form
and
has
the
same
legal
consequences
as
an
oath
composed
of
the
traditional
words
of
“truth,
the
whole
truth,
and
nothing
but
the
truth.”
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
that
is
at
the
cert
petition
at
appendix,
page
a8,
footnote
4.
i
have
been
advised
by
referee
ryan
that
the
form
of
oath
that
he
uses
is
an
oath
as
follows:
“do
you
swear
that
the
evidence
that
you
shall
give
in
this
proceeding
shall
be
the
truth,
so
help
you
god?”
now,
therefore,
the
court
was
wrong
in
surmising
that
the--
in
form,
the
oath
contained
an
explicit
reference
to
the
whole
truth
principle.
in
our
view,
however,
this
makes
no
difference.
when
a
witness
takes
his
oath
to
take
the
truth,
he’s
bound
to
tell
the
truth,
and
we
say
mr.
bronston
didn’t
do
it.
on
closing,
it’s
our
contention
that
petitioner’s
position
would
constitute
an
open
invitation
to
the
clever
witness
seeking
to
conceal
the
truth,
to
engage
in
half-true
evasive
and
deceptive
answers,
in
short,
to
subvert
the
integrity
of
the
fact-finding
process
within
impunity
so
long
as
he
can
be
literally
or
technically
truthful.
the
principle
that
the
court
lays
down
in
this
case
will
not
apply
solely
to
bankruptcy
proceedings
because
we’re
engaged
in
an
interpretation
of
federal
perjury
statute.
a
reversal
of
petitioner’s
conviction
would
suggest
that
the
same
source
of
deceit
and
falsehood
by
negative
implication
that
would
go
unpunished
here
could
be
resorted
to
by
a
witness
in
a
criminal
case
where
a
man’s
liberty
may
be
at
stake.
we
don’t
believe
it’s
too
much
for
the
sake
of
the
integrity
of
the
federal
fact-finding
process
to
require
witnesses
to
be
truthful
not
just
in
the
narrow
technical
sense,
but
the
literal
meaning
of
their
words,
but
in
the
broader
sense
of
the
true
meaning
of
the
words
and
in
the
true
context
in
which
they
are
uttered.
accordingly,
we
submit
the
conviction
should
be
affirmed.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
central
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
a
witness
who
knowingly,
willfully,
and
with
the
intent
to
deceive
and
conceal
give
sworn
testimony
which,
considered
in
the
context
in
which
it
was
given,
constitutes
a
falsehood
by
implication
can
escape
punishment
for
perjury
on
the
ground
that
the
words
that
he
uttered
were
literally
or
technically
truthful
when
considered
in
isolation.
now,
i’d
like
to
begin
with
what
the
jury
necessarily
found
when
it
convicted
petitioner
in
this
case.
judge
taney’s
charge
to
the
jury
was,
we
believe,
a
model
of
clarity
and
of
precision,
and
we
have
set
forth
the
relevant
portions
of
it
in
appendix
b
to
our
brief.
judge
taney
made
it
quite
clear
to
the
jury
that
they
had
to
find
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
that
the
petitioner
understood
the
question,
that
his
response
to
the
question
was
not
inaccurate
as
a
result
of
haste,
inadvertence,
misunderstanding,
confusion,
negligence,
or
any
honest
error
on
his
part.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
yes,
i
think
that
this--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
i
think
that’s
true.
we
don’t
have
to
read
that
in
as
a
matter
of
law
because
this
is
an
issue
that,
as
i’m
trying
to
point
out
here,
the
jury
did
resolve.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
yes,
i
do
agree,
your
honor.
when--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
that’s
what
the
jury
found,
because
the
judge
instructed
them
apart
from
the
question
of
understanding
that
they
must
find
that
he
made
a
statement
which,
when
considered
in
the
entire
context,
was
a
false
statement.
and,
he
further
instructed
that
they
must
find
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
that
he
made
the
statement
with
an
intent
to
deceive.
so
that,
when
the
jury
convicted
petitioner,
the
jury
necessarily
found
that
he
understood
the
question
and
they
necessarily
found
that
his
statement,
“the
company
had
an
account
in
zurich
for
about
six
months,”
was
of
the
same
effect
and
had
the
same
meaning
in
the
context
as
if
he
had
said
the
company
had
an
account
in
zurich
for
about
six
months
and
there
were
no
other
accounts.
that’s
what
the
jury
found.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
there
is
a
question
of
course
as
to
whether
the
jury
could
properly
find
that
under
the
evidence
in
the--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
that’s
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
that
may
be
true
if
an
error
is--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
yes,
if
there’s
an
error
in
submitting
the
case
to
the
jury.
we
don’t
believe
there
was
such
an
error
in
this
case.
basically,
petitioner’s
arguments
fall
into
two
categories.
the
one
group
of
arguments
for
those
that
say
the
case
should
never
have
gone
to
the
jury.
the
second
group
are
those
that
say
all
of
these
may
be
true,
what
the
jury
found
may
be
true.
it
may
be
true
that
this
was
a
lie
by
negative
implication,
but
that’s
not
enough
as
a
matter
of
law,
and
the
judge
was
in
error
when
he
charged
that
technical
truthfulness
is
not
sufficient.
i’d
like
to
take
up
first
the
ambiguity
point
that
mr.
elsen
discussed,
which
is
basically
a
question
of
whether
it
was
proper
to
submit
this
issue
to
the
jury.
now,
i
point
out
that,
in
addition
to
the
jury,
none
of
the
judges
below
had
the
least
difficulty
with
this
contention.
they
were
all
satisfied
that
the
word
“you,”
as
used
in
the
context
of
these
questions,
at
least
called
for
information
about
petitioner’s
personal
accounts.
now
in
our
view,
looking
at
the
context
of
the
proceeding,
it
was
logical
to
assume
that
it
called
for
information
about
both
personal
and
corporate
accounts.
but,
in
any
event,
we
do
not
believe
that
it
can
be
construed
as
calling
for
information
only
about
his
corporate
accounts.
i
think,
perhaps
i
can
illustrate
that
point
for
you
by
hypothetical.
suppose
the
company
had
had
no
accounts
in
switzerland
at
any
time.
there
had
been
only
petitioner’s
personal
account,
and
he
had
been
asked
these
very
questions
that
he
was
asked.
and,
in
response
to
the
question
“have
you
ever
had
a
swiss
bank
account?”
he
had
simply
answered
no.
now,
i
don’t
think
it
could
seriously
be
contended
that
that
response
would’ve
been
non-perjurious
in
view
of
the
existence
of
his
personal
geneva
account.
yet,
if
the
ambiguity
argument,
as
a
matter
of
law,
holds
water
then
that
response--
the
question
was
still
unambiguous.
you
couldn’t
go
to
the
jury
even
if
he
had
said
no
in
those
circumstances.
and,
i
think
if
you
look
at
the
context
of
this
proceeding
and
of
the
questions,
there
was
evidence
from
which
the
jury
could
reasonably
infer
that
the
word
“you”
referred
to
petitioner’s
personal
accounts.
first
of
all,
there’s
the
word
in
even
the
question
itself.
in
normal
meaning
of
those
questions,
it
seems
to
me,
is
that
“you”
is
“you,
mr.
bronston.”
now,
petitioner
says
“well,
but
this
was
a
bankruptcy
arrangement
proceeding
for
mr.
bronston’s
onus
corporation.”
that’s
true.
however,
the
nature
of
this
proceeding
is
one
in
which
the
creditors
are
trying
to
discover
in
marshal
the
assets
of
the
company
in
order
to
be
sure
that
the
creditors’
claims
are
going
to
be
satisfied
that
there’s
been
no
improper
diversion
of
company
assets
into
friends
or
into
the
personal
hands
of
the
whole--
sole
owner
of
the
company.
so,
it’s
highly
material.
it’s
not
just
material
as
a
technical
matter,
but
it’s
highly
material
to
the
bankruptcy
inquiry
to
determine
petitioner’s
individual
finances
to
see
whether
there
is
money
that
is
in
his
personal
possession
which
properly
belongs
to
the
corporation
and
should
be
reachable
by
the
creditors
as
part
of
the
arrangement.
now,
the
evidence--
in
this
case,
the
account
had
been
closed
and
it
has
never
been
established
that
there
was
bankruptcy
fraud
by
petitioner.
however,
on
the--in
the
setting
of
this
situation,
i
think
it’s
quite
clear
that
the
questions
were
addressed
to
his
personal
account.
now,
one
other
point
in
this
connection--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
first
of
all,
he
deflected
inquiry
into
this
account
within--
through
which
$180,000
have
passed
which
he
used
for
mixed
business
and
personal
purposes
according
to
the
testimony
at
the
trial
in
the
perjury
case.
i
can’t
tell
you
what
specifically
he
would’ve
gained.
what
i
can
tell
you
is
that
it’s
possible
that
either
there
were
or
he
though
there
were
some
improprieties
in
that
personal
account
which
would’ve
been
revealed--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
it
hasn’t
been
proved
that
he
suffered
by
it.
the
fact
is
that
no
inquiry
was
made
to
the
geneva
account.
had
he
mentioned
the
geneva
account,
i
think
it’s
quite
clear
that
an
investigation
about--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
the
personal
account
ledger
was
introduced
and
there
was
evidence
regarding
some
of
the
transactions.
there
was
some
evidence
that
the
government
sought
to
introduce
regarding
an
unexplained
series
of
transactions
involving
a
$25-payment
from
the
company
to
lichtenstein
corporation
or
the
dorchester
establishment
which,
five
weeks
after,
paid
$20,000
into
this
personal
geneva
account.
now,
that
evidence
was
introduced
and
was
before
the
jury
when
mr.
elsen
sought
to
rebut
that
evidence
by
putting
an
explanatory
evidence.
there
was
a
conference
at
the
bench.
as
a
result
of
which,
the
matter
was
dropped
and
the
government
did
not
argue
to
the
jury,
and
i
can’t
say
to
you
that
there
was
any
impropriety
in
this
transaction,
but
what
i
can
say
is
that
it’s
very
possible
that
mr.
bronston
thought
there
was
something
about
that
account
that
he
didn’t
want
these
people
snooping
into.
there
was
a
substantial
account,
$180,000.
even
though
it
was
closed
now,
assets
can
be
traced
from
account
to
account.
now,
we
will
agree
that
there
are
circumstances
in
which
a
question
can
be
so
ambiguous
that,
as
a
matter
of
law,
you
can’t
ask
the
jury
to
find
whether
the
defendant
understood
the
question.
an
example
of
that
would
be
the
latamore
case
where
he
was
asked
if
he
was
a
follower
of
the
communist
law
and,
in
reversing
his
perjury
conviction,
it
was
stated
properly,
i
believe,
that
the
jury
shouldn’t
be
allowed
to
speculate
on
what
such
a
vague
term
may
mean.
in
the
cobert
case,
he
was
asked
about
a
listing
post
and
the
indictment
didn’t
indicate
what
a
listing
post
was
or
that
he
had
any
understanding
of
what
a
listing
post
was.
we
don’t
have
that
kind
of
a
problem
here.
everybody
knows
what
a
bank
account
is.
now,
i
think
we
know
what
“you”
is.
it’s
not--
it
doesn’t
suffer
from
that
kind
of
ambiguity.
finally,
the
point
that
i
think
you
brought
out
earlier,
mr.
justice
white,
petitioner’s
argument
is
completely
theoretical.
he
is
saying
this
is
ambiguous
as
a
matter
of
law.
he
never
got
up
on
the
stand
and
said
i
didn’t
understand
the
question.
at
no
point
has
he
introduced
evidence
to
that
effect.
we’re
dealing--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
no,
i
don’t
believe
my
argument
has
to
be
that
at
all.
i’ll
turn
to
that
point
now.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
no,
i
would
not.
i
mean,
let’s
take
judge
lumbard’s
example
in
his
dissenting
opinion,
he
says
suppose
petitioner
had
answered
the
question
by
saying
“my
daughter
went
to
school
in
switzerland.”
well,
he
says
this
is
an
unresponsive
answer.
he
says
it’s
very
similar
to
the
answer
he
gave,
at
least
in
the
chain
the
difference
is
a
matter
of
degree.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
no,
i
would
say
it
could
not
go
to
the
jury
in
that
case,
and
the
reason
it
could
not
go
to
the
jury
is
that
the
answer
“my
daughter
went
to
school
in
switzerland”
does
not
contain
any
implication
about
bank
accounts
one
way
or
another.
it
cannot
be
understood
to
be
a
denial
of
the
existence
of
any
bank
accounts,
but
the
answer
“the
company
had
an
account
in
zurich
for
about
six
months”
can
be
understood
and
the
jury
took
it
to
mean
that
was
the
only
account.
they
were
no
other
accounts,
and
our
case
does
depend
upon
that
implication
that
we
say
the
jury
could
properly
find
was
in
here
and
in
his
answer.
but,
not
just
any
unresponsive
answer
is--
would
expose
the
witness
to
perjury.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
yes,
indeed,
by--
if
your
statement
contains
with
it
an
implication,
as
many
statements
do.
the
question
is
what
did
you
intend
to
convey
and
what
did
you
convey?
the
question
is
should
we
look
just
at
the
literal
word,
should
we
pars
them
as
narrowly
as
possible,
or
should
we
look
at
the
meaning?
may
the
jury
say
“yes,
in
this
context,
we
find
that
when
he
said
these
words
he
meant
to
deny
the
existence
of
the
geneva
account”
because
that
is
what
they
found,
and
we
say
that
if
that’s
the
meaning,
even
though
the
meaning
is
not
part
of
the
literal
technical
parceling
of
his
dry
words,
he
still
can
be
held
accountable
for
that
mistake.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
they
were
asked
by
counsel
for
one
of
the
principal
creditors
of
the
corporation.
now,
we
believe
that
the
position
the
petitioner
has
taken
is
directly
contrary
to
the
basic
purpose
of
the
perjury
statute
which
has,
as
a
central
concern,
protecting
the
integrity
of
the
fact-finding
process.
they
dismissed
and
judge
lumbard
dismissed--
dismisses
the
factor
that
the
inquiry
is
frustrated
and
misled
as
being
not
material,
but
we
think
it’s
the
very
evil
of
which
the
perjury
statute
is
really
aimed.
now--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
it’s
easy
for
us
to
stand
here
now
knowing
about
the
existence
of
the
geneva
account
and
looking
back
at
the
matter.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
because
i
think
the
lawyer
understood
petitioner’s
answer,
the
way
the
jury
understood
petitioner’s
answer,
to
deny
the
geneva
account
and,
therefore,
was
fruitless
to
ask
another
question.
he
already
had
the
information
he
was
seeking.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
i
don’t
believe
that’s
so.
we
were
dealing
here
with
a
very
experienced
and
capable
new
york
lawyer
who
did
not
ask
the
next
question.
now,
i
can’t
say
why
he
didn’t
ask
the
next
question,
but
it
does
seem
to
me
that
he
had
an
answer
which
seemed
to
answer
his
question
in
its
entirety.
that
is,
the
answer
the
company
had
an
account
in
zurich
for
about
six
months
suggest
that
that
was
the
only
bank
account
that
existed.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
i
think
the
united
states
attorney
would
make
this
decision.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
i’m
not
certain
of
that.
i’m
not
certain.
in
this
case,
i
believe
the
information
was
provided
by
the
creditor
whose
attorney
had
been
asking
the
questioning
to
the
united
states
attorney.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
that
is
true.
in
fact,
the--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
this
wasn’t
just
any
line
of
questioning,
mr.
justice
marshall.
this
was
questioning
that
was
going
to
something
which
was--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
now,
that’s
true.
he
could
certainly
have
asked.
he
could’ve
repeated
the
question
with
a
different
wording.
he
could’ve
said
“yes,
what
about
your
personal
accounts?
did
you
have
any
of
those?”
he
could’ve
done
that.
there’s
no
question.
the
questioning
that
immediately
preceded
the
swiss
bank
account
questioning
concerned
mrs.
bronston’s
jewelry.
clearly,
a
personal
matter,
and
immediately
following
that
into
the
swiss
bank
account
questions.
now,
we
think
that
while
the
policies
are
not
the
same
where
you’re
dealing
with
criminal
fraud
or
extortion,
there
is
a
general
principle
of
american
jurisprudence
that
you
look
at
statements
in
the
context
in
which
they
are
uttered.
you
give
them
the
meaning
that
the
context
suggests
that
they
convey.
you
don’t
look
at
them
strictly
in
terms
of
the
literal
words,
and
we
think
the
same
policy
ought
to
apply
in
the
perjury
area
as
it
applies
in
civil
areas
and
other
areas
with
criminal
utterance.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
i
think
if
this
were
a
criminal
fraud
case
it
would
also
be
true
that
you
will
look
at
the
context
of
the
statement,
and
we
have
cited
cases
in
our
brief
to
that
effect.
it’s
true--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
no,
i’m
not
suggesting
that
automatically
the
same
policy
would
apply
to
perjury.
there
are
different
considerations,
but
i
am
saying
that
what
the
dissent
in
the
court
of
appeals
proposed
was
that
we
simply
look
at
the
words
in
isolation
from
the
context
in
which
they
were
spoken.
if
those
words
are
literally
true,
the
inquiry
is
at
an
end.
now,
i’d
like
to
touch
briefly
on
the
hypotheticals
which
we,
in
our
brief,
and
petitioner,
in
his
reply
brief,
have
brought
out.
i
think
that
one
can
readily
see
that
literal
truthfulness
should
not
be
a
total
defense
to
a
perjury
charge.
from
the
example
of
the
question
“who
was
at
the
meeting
of
june
1?”
and
the
response
“smith
and
brown,”
when
in
fact,
jones
and
robinson
were
also
at
the
meeting,
now,
the
response
“smith
and
brown”
is
literally
truthful.
you
could’ve
of
course
asked
another
question,
“anyone
else?”
but,
the
response
“smith
and
brown”
in
the
context
can
suggest
that
that’s
a
total
answer.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
you
could
do
that.
that’s
right,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
and
i
think
that
i
will
concede
that
the
inquiry
here
was
not
the
most
skillful
that
one
can
imagine,
but
the
question
is
whether
the
witness
who
has
spoken
falsely
should
be
relieved
of
the
onus
of
his
offense
by
virtue
of
the
inaptitude
of
counsel
asking
the
questions.
this
witness
understood
what
the
question
called
for.
he
gave
an
answer
which
was
designed
to
and
which
did
convey
false
information,
denying
the
existence
of
a
swiss
bank
account.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
it
depends
on
how
he
does
it
of
course,
and
only
if
he
conceals
it
by
a
false
statement
would
it
be
perjury.
but,
our
contention
is
that
that
is
what
he
did.
he
could
simply
have
answered
the
question
“yes.”
i
mean,
that
would’ve
been
a
completely
satisfactory
and
non-perjurious
answer
and
would’ve
put
the
ball
back
in
the
court
of
the
person
asking
the
questions.
instead,
he
chose
to
answer
in
a
manner
which
applied
the
non-existence
of
this
personal
geneva
account.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
you
think
petitioner
wasn’t
thinking
about
it?
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
that’s
probably
true,
he
wasn’t--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
that’s
true,
but
he--
here,
he
was
dealing
with
a
witness
who
had
come
in,
as
an
effect,
a
plaintiff
asking
relief
of
the
court
for
his
cooperation,
asking
the
bankruptcy
court
and
asking
his
creditors
to
participate
in
arrangement.
he
was
dealing
with
a
witness
who
had
unique
possession
of
the
information
that
was
necessary
to
be
developed
for
the
sake
of
assuring
that
the
arrangement
that
would
be
arrived
at
would
be
fair
to
the
creditors.
the
lawyer,
since
this
was
a
discovery
type
of
proceeding,
he
didn’t
already
have
this
information.
he
didn’t
know
the
answers.
he
didn’t
know
about
the
existence
of
any
swiss
bank
accounts
one
way
or
the
other.
this
was
information
that
mr.
bronston
knew
of,
and
mr.
bronston
was,
therefore,
in
a
position
where
he
could
much
more
easily
mislead
the
inquiry
than
you
would
be
at
a
trial
where
of
course,
in
many
cases,
the
lawyers
already
know
the
information
and
their
problem
is
to
bring
it,
develop
it
for
the
fact-finder.
here,
you
have
a
discovery
proceeding
and
the
court
of
appeals
in
their
opinion
emphasized
the
particular
importance.
it
would
also
be
important
in
grand
jury
proceedings
which
are
discovery
proceedings
in
the
criminal
area.
a
witness
is
to
be
free
to
give
any
kind
of
answer
so
long
as
it’s
literally
truthful
no
matter
how
misleading
it
is,
no
matter
what
implications
it
carries,
no
matter
to
what
extent
it
deflects
the
grand
jury’s
inquiry.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
if
the
lawyer
sees
that
he’
been--
that
he
is
or
may
have
been
lied
to.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
i
think
that,
again,
i
have
to
come
back
to
what
i
think
the--
what
the
jury
found
petitioner’s
statement
to
mean
which
was
that
he
had
already
denied
the
existence
of
this
account.
i
mean,
in
my
example
with--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
in
my
example
with
the
persons
at
the
meeting
where
the
answer
“smith
and
brown,”
which
i
believe
petitioner
concedes
as
perjurious
in
that
context,
although
i
think
judge
lumbard
would
not
find
it
to
be,
you
would
agree
that
all
you
have
to
do
is
ask
anyone
else
and
you
could’ve
bring
out
the
rest
of
that
information.
yet,
the
answer
suggests
no
one
else,
and
if
the
answer
stands,
no
one
else
is
the
answer
to
which
the
witness
is
held.
now,
the
difference
in
the
example
the
petitioner
has
used
in
his
reply
brief
is,
he
says
that
if
the
answer
had
been
“smith
and
jones
were
the
blacks
at
the
meeting,”
that
would
not
be
perjurious.
we
agree
that
will
not
be
perjurious.
the
example
is
inapt,
however,
for
the
reason
that
the
statement
“smith
and
jones
were
the
blacks
at
the
meeting”
carries
with
it
no
implication
denying
presence
of
other
persons
at
the
meeting.
on
the
contrary,
it
implies
that
there
were
other
people
at
the
meeting.
now,
if
this
answer
had
implied
that
there
were
other
bank
accounts,
we
wouldn’t
be
here
today
because
we
would
agree
that
there
would
be
no
perjury
charge
to
submit
to
the
jury.
if
this
answer
had
been
completely
unresponsive
like
the
daughter
going
to
school
in
switzerland,
there
would
be
no
negative
implication,
no
false
statement
contained.
now,
there’s
one
matter
that
i
would
like
to
call
to
the
court’s
attention
that
has
come
to
our
attention
in
the
course
of
preparing
for
the
argument.
the
opinion
of
the
second
circuit
speaks
about
the
whole
truth
principle
of
the
oath
and,
in
a
footnote,
they
stated
“it
may
be
the
duce
from
these
orders
and
forms
in
the
purposes
of
the
act
that
an
oath
given
in
a
bankruptcy
proceeding
basically
takes
the
same
form
and
has
the
same
legal
consequences
as
an
oath
composed
of
the
traditional
words
of
“truth,
the
whole
truth,
and
nothing
but
the
truth.”
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
that
is
at
the
cert
petition
at
appendix,
page
a8,
footnote
4.
i
have
been
advised
by
referee
ryan
that
the
form
of
oath
that
he
uses
is
an
oath
as
follows:
“do
you
swear
that
the
evidence
that
you
shall
give
in
this
proceeding
shall
be
the
truth,
so
help
you
god?”
now,
therefore,
the
court
was
wrong
in
surmising
that
the--
in
form,
the
oath
contained
an
explicit
reference
to
the
whole
truth
principle.
in
our
view,
however,
this
makes
no
difference.
when
a
witness
takes
his
oath
to
take
the
truth,
he’s
bound
to
tell
the
truth,
and
we
say
mr.
bronston
didn’t
do
it.
on
closing,
it’s
our
contention
that
petitioner’s
position
would
constitute
an
open
invitation
to
the
clever
witness
seeking
to
conceal
the
truth,
to
engage
in
half-true
evasive
and
deceptive
answers,
in
short,
to
subvert
the
integrity
of
the
fact-finding
process
within
impunity
so
long
as
he
can
be
literally
or
technically
truthful.
the
principle
that
the
court
lays
down
in
this
case
will
not
apply
solely
to
bankruptcy
proceedings
because
we’re
engaged
in
an
interpretation
of
federal
perjury
statute.
a
reversal
of
petitioner’s
conviction
would
suggest
that
the
same
source
of
deceit
and
falsehood
by
negative
implication
that
would
go
unpunished
here
could
be
resorted
to
by
a
witness
in
a
criminal
case
where
a
man’s
liberty
may
be
at
stake.
we
don’t
believe
it’s
too
much
for
the
sake
of
the
integrity
of
the
federal
fact-finding
process
to
require
witnesses
to
be
truthful
not
just
in
the
narrow
technical
sense,
but
the
literal
meaning
of
their
words,
but
in
the
broader
sense
of
the
true
meaning
of
the
words
and
in
the
true
context
in
which
they
are
uttered.
accordingly,
we
submit
the
conviction
should
be
affirmed.
