mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
in
the
view
of
the
united
states
anticipated
a
little
bit
mr.
justice
rehnquist's
question.
this
case
presents
a
quite
narrow
question
of
statutory
construction
and
answering
that
question,
we
believe
that
this
court
can
put
aside
more
far
reaching
problems
of
standing
to
litigate
constitutional
issues
or
to
enforce
statutes
that
do
not
expressly
provide
for
a
right
of
private
action
and
do
not
contain
a
provision
conferring
standing
on
a
defined
class
of
persons.
in
the
fair
housing
act
of
1968,
congress
has
specified
two
methods
of
private
enforcement.
one
providing
for
recourse
to
the
conciliation
efforts
of
the
department
of
housing
and
urban
development
before
a
suit
is
brought
and
the
other
authorizing
direct
action
in
the
courts,
and
the
act's
standing
provision
which
is
reproduced
on
page
two
of
our
brief
is
in
the
words
of
the
court
of
appeals
very
broad.
certainly,
the
language
is
broad
enough
to
cover
the
petitioners
here.
they
are
within
the
literal
terms
of
the
provision
and
they
have
alleged
economic
injury
to
themselves,
injury
in
their
social
relationships
and
injury
to
their
reputation
through
the
practices
that
the
act
forbids
that
they
alleged
that
have
occurred
here,
whether
their
claims
of
injury
can
be
substantiated,
remains
to
be
tried
if
this
court
holds
as
we
believe
it
should,
they
have
a
right
to
have
this
claims
heard.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
correct,
that
is
the
standing
provision.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
by
a
discriminatory
housing
practice
within
the
meaning
of
the
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
we
don't
suggest
that
the
literal
reading
is
the
end
all,
but
it's
certainly
is
the
beginning
of
the
interpretation.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
they
would
confer
a
standing.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
he
could
make
that
claim
obviously.
there
would
be
great
difficulty
in
substantiating
that
claim
in
those
circumstances.
we
do
not
take
the
position
that
any
person
can
complain
nor
has
hud
in
its
administration
of
the
statute,
read
--
applied
to
terms
that
literally,
but
hud
has
consistently
entertained
and
processed
complaints
by
persons
similar
to
those
--
similarly
situated
to
those
here
and
not
only
the
complaints
of
petitioners
trafficante
and
carr,
but
complaints
by
others,
hud
officials
estimated
to
me
that
a
little
more
than
10%
of
their
initial
complaints
and
inquiries
they
would
guess
around
12%
come
either
from
--
come
from
whites
who
are
either
tenants
in
an
apartment
complex;
if
they
claim
is
discriminating
or
who
are
customers
of
housing
developers
that
they
claim
are
discriminating.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
under
the
literal
terns
of
the
provision,
it
would
not
be
necessary.
as
the
statute
has
been
administered,
hud
has
found
a
concrete
content
for
those
literal
terms.
in
some
of
the
practicalities,
that
are
inherent
in
the
subject
matter
with
which
congress
was
dealing
and
in
the
legislative
history
of
the
act
which
we
believes
corroborates
the
way
the
government
has
been
applying
the
provision.
we
have
recounted
in
our
brief
some
of
the
difficulties
encountered
both
in
our
own
experience
in
investigating
and
finding
witnesses
for
our
parent
and
practice
suits
and
in
the
experience
of
the
naacp
legal
defense
fund,
recounted
to
you
in
an
amicus
brief
in
this
case
which
we
commend
to
the
court's
attention
in
developing
private
litigation.
we
have
reviewed
in
our
brief
some
of
the
difficulties
experienced
with
those
persons
who
have
been
turned
away
or
rejected
as
applicants,
who
often
are
not
in
a
position
to
know
why
they've
been
turned
away
who
have
to
satisfy
their
housing
needs
elsewhere
without
awaiting
the
outcome
of
litigation
and
who
often
do
not
wish
to
force
their
way
through
litigation
into
a
place
where
they've
been
made
to
feel
unwelcome.
on
the
other
hand,
tenants
or
organizations
have
long
been
in
the
forefront
of
litigation
on
this
subject
as
is
recounted
in
the
book
by
simon
on
dorsey
against
stuyvesant
town,
cited
in
the
petitioner's
brief.
and
we
believe
this
is
because
of
the
continuing
nature
of
the
injury
that
they
suffer
and
the
fact
that,
that
injury
can
often
be
more
effectively
redressed
in
the
courts,
then
the
injury
to
a
rejected
applicant,
who
has
had
to
satisfy
his
housing
needs
elsewhere,
and
significantly,
this
injury
to
incumbent
tenants
was
recognized
and
discussed
in
the
act's
legislative
history.
as
we
recount
in
our
brief,
repeated
references
were
made
in
the
floor
debates
to
the
discrimination
experienced
by
a
black
naval
officer
when
he
attempted
to
rent
an
apartment
in
a
certain
building
and
to
a
letter
from
one
of
the
buildings
tenants
expressing
his
shame
and
outrage
that
this
had
occurred.
it
is
true
that
the
predominant
concern
expressed
in
the
legislative
history
was
with
the
plight
of
those
turned
away
and
the
court
of
appeals
mistakenly
in
our
view
relied
on
expressions
of
that
concern
to
reach
the
conclusion
that
was
not
expressed
in
the
legislative
history,
the
chief
justice
has
read
some
excerpts
from
it,
that
only
those
individuals
or
the
attorney
general
with
his
limited
resources
could
sue.
there
was
a
subsidiary,
but
recurrent
theme
in
the
legislative
history
which
we
have
set
forth
in
considerable
detail
in
our
brief
and
that
theme
was
the
blacks
and
whites
alike,
are
harmed
by
being
forced
to
live
in
racially
segregated
neighborhoods
and
that
the
harm
to
both
races
would
be
alleviated
by
the
act
and
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
of
course,
the
only
issue
before
the
court
in
this
case,
involves
complainants
who
themselves
are
living
in
the
particular
complex
or
development
that
they
claim
has
been
discriminating
and
where
they
have
that
close
identification
with
the
particular
development
or
community
such
that
i
think
there
is
a
reasonable
expectation
that
their
reputations
could
be
injured
and
the
like.
certainly
if
you
posit
the
case
of
a
man
running
for
political
office,
you
could
see
instances
where
there
would
be
very
real
injury
to
a
man's
reputation
and
economic
interest.
when
you
get
to
the
question
of
what
about
the
next
door
neighbor,
couldn't
he
perhaps
be
similarly
injured?
that's
an
issue
that
needn't
be
reached
here.
hud
itself
has
not
had
complaints
of
that
kind.
hud
has
adopted
regulations
which
in
their
standing
provision
track
this
little
thing
which
of
the
statute.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
i
think
the
thrust
of
this
aspect
of
the
legislative
history
is
that
congress
believed
that
whites
and
blacks
are
injured
by
being
forced
to
live
in
artificially
segregated
neighborhoods
and
if
someone
comes
forward
and
shows
that
injury,
hud
officials
have
said
to
me
that
they
believe
that
would
be
within
the
terms
of
their
regulations
to
a
person
who
has
standing.
this
question
is
not
arising
either
in
complains
to
hud
or
in
the
courts
and
i
don't
see
any
reason
to
anticipate
it.
it's
much
more
likely
that
someone
living
in
the
complex
will
be
in
a
position
to
have
the
knowledge
to
complaint.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
if
the
complex
across
the
street
is
discriminating
within
the
meaning
of
the
act?
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
that
question
is
not
in
this
case.
as
i
have
been
saying,
there
is
reason
to
think
that
anyone
in
the
neighborhood
who
is
injured,
would
have
standing,
considering
the
thrust
of
this
aspect
of
the
legislative
history
and
the
breadth
of
the
language
congress
used,
but
this
seems
to
be
largely
an
academic
question.
hud
has
been
receiving
2,500
complaints
a
year
under
this
statute;
none
of
the
complainants
are
in
this
category.
they
are
not
likely
to
have
the
requisite
information
to
make
such
a
complaint
and
it's
much
more
likely
that
the
real
injury
that
would
motivate
a
complaint,
would
be
filed
by
someone
more
directly
associated
with
the
complex
where
the
discrimination
was
occurring,
whether
it's
an
apartment
development
or
a
development
of
tracked
homes.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
in
our
brief,
we
discussed
only
the
question
under
title
8.
we
do
have
one
footnote
which
indicates
that
we
think
that
the
negro
petitioners
seem
to
come
within
the
terms
of
1982,
to
the
extent
that
they
are
complaining
that
they
are
victims
of
tokenism
in
living
in
this
large
development
where
their
race
is
discriminated
against.
they
are
not
being
permitted
to
lease
on
the
same
terms
as
white
persons
in
that
sense,
and
we
have
suggested
that
that
seems
to
fit
the
language
of
1982.
of
course,
our
principle
concern
is
with
our
responsibilities
for
administering
title
8
and
with
the
complaints
that
hud
has
been
entertaining
and
that
the
holding
of
the
court
below
seems
to
imply
hud
is
not
empowered
to
entertain
the
process.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
in
the
view
of
the
united

mr.
justice
rehnquist's
question.
this

presents
a

certainly,

is
broad

to

the
petitioners
here.
they
are
within

to
themselves,
injury
in

claims
of

to
be

they
have
a
right
to

claims
heard.
mr.
lawrence

is
correct,
that
is
the
standing
provision.

arising
either
in
complains
to
hud
or
in
the
courts
and
i
don't
see
any
reason
to
anticipate
it.
it's
much
more
likely
that
someone
living
in
the
complex
will
be
in
a
position
to
have
the
knowledge
to
complaint.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
if
the
complex
across
the
street
is
discriminating
within
the
meaning
of
the
act?
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
that
question
is
not
in
this
case.
as
i
have
been
saying,
there
is
reason
to
think
that
anyone
in
the
neighborhood
who
is
injured,
would
have
standing,
considering
the
thrust
of
this
aspect
of
the
legislative
history
and
the
breadth
of
the
language
congress
used,
but
this
seems
to
be
largely
an
academic
question.
hud
has
been
receiving
2,500
complaints
a
year
under
this
statute;
none
of
the
complainants
are
in
this
category.
they
are
not
likely
to
have
the
requisite
information
to
make
such
a
complaint
and
it's
much
more
likely
that
the
real
injury
that
would
motivate
a
complaint,
would
be
filed
by
someone
more
directly
associated
with
the
complex
where
the
discrimination
was
occurring,
whether
it's
an
apartment
development
or
a
development
of
tracked
homes.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
in
our
brief,
we
discussed
only
the
question
under
title
8.
we
do
have
one
footnote
which
indicates
that
we
think
that
the
negro
petitioners
seem
to
come
within
the
terms
of
1982,
to
the
extent
that
they
are
complaining
that
they
are
victims
of
tokenism
in
living
in
this
large
development
where
their
race
is
discriminated
against.
they
are
not
being
permitted
to
lease
on
the
same
terms
as
white
persons
in
that
sense,
and
we
have
suggested
that
that
seems
to
fit
the
language
of
1982.
of
course,
our
principle
concern
is
with
our
responsibilities
for
administering
title
8
and
with
the
complaints
that
hud
has
been
entertaining
and
that
the
holding
of
the
court
below
seems
to
imply
hud
is
not
empowered
to
entertain
the
process.
