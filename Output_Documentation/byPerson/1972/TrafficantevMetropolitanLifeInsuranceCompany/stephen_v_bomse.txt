mr.
stephen
v.
bomse
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
issue
which
we
confront
here
today
is
whether
tenants
at
a
large,
privately
owned
apartment
complex
have
standing
to
challenge
practices
of
racial
discrimination
by
their
landlord,
under
writ
of
the
1968
civil
rights
act,
title
8
thereof
or
42
u.s.c,
section
1982,
the
statute
principally
interpreted
by
this
court
in
its
1968
decision
of
jones
against
maya.
the
petitioners
here
are
both
negro
and
white
residents
of
parkmerced,
a
3500
unit
apartment
complex
in
san
francisco,
california.
they
filed
a
lawsuit
under
title
8
and
under
1982
alleging
that
parkmerced
was
generally
responsible
for
practices
condemned
by
both
of
those
statutes
and
refusing
occupancy
there
to
members
of
the
negro
race,
and
other
minority
races.
their
action
was
against
the
landlords
responsible
for
that
discrimination.
motions
to
dismiss
were
made
in
the
district
court
on
a
variety
of
grounds
and
the
court
granted
those
motions,
limited
however
to
the
question
of
standing
which
is
before
this
court
today.
the
case
then
went
to
the
ninth
circuit
courts
of
appeals
where
the
decision
of
the
district
court
was
affirmed
again,
limited
solely
to
the
question
of
standing.
we
sought
certiorari
and
that
was
granted.
it
is
our
submission
today
that
the
decision
below
should
be
reversed
and
the
petitioners
held
to
have
standing.
in
view
of
the
language
of
the
relevant
statutes,
the
clear
policies
which
they
embody
and
the
national
commitment
which
i
think,
none
of
us
would
reasonably
again
say
minimize
to
eliminate
racial
discrimination
from
housing
not
only
because
that
of
itself
is
a
crucial
problem
to
our
nation
today,
but
because
it
quite
clearly
infects
our
national
life
in
a
variety
of
other
circumstances.
to
recall
only
the
most
obvious
one,
the
terribly
divisive
national
controversy
over
busing
has
mean
to
culminating,
segregation,
and
separation
of
the
races
in
the
schools.
it's
in
large
part
a
product
of
the
fact
that
the
races
in
this
country
leave
apart.
that
fact
has
been
too
well
documented
to
really
be
disputed
here.
it's
been
documented
by
the
united
states
civil
rights
commission
in
its
notion
that
we
are
indeed
moving
towards
two
societies,
they
are
not
speaking,
really
in
a
social
or
any
in
tangible
sense,
we
live
apart.
so
what
is
an
issue
here
is
whether
the
commitment
which
petitioners
submit
is
embodied
in
the
laws
and
issue
title
8
of
1982,
is
going
to
be
broadly
or
narrowly
upheld.
we
submit
it
should
be
the
former.
we
trust
that
any
inquiry
on
the
question
of
standing
begins,
at
least
some
members
of
this
court
would
suggest
ends
with
the
question
of
whether
there
is
injury
in
fact.
that
is
a
test
which
at
least
as
i
read
the
cases
is
the
constitutional
or
article
3
cases
in
controversy.
but
i
don't
think
that
there
is
a
great
dispute
here
over
injury.
this
court
has
noted
in
the
numerous
recent
cases,
including
most
recently
sierra
club
against
morton,
that
their
interest
be
on
mere
economic
ones
which
merit
judicial
protection.
in
sierra
club,
the
court
referred
to
the
environmental
questions
there
in
issue
as
an
important
ingredient
of
the
quality
of
life
in
our
society.
it's
language
which
was
also
used
in
a
very
well
reasoned
opinion
of
the
third
circuit,
involving
title
8
in
part
shannon
versus
hud
in
which
the
third
circuit
suggested
that
the
persons
who
neither
are
going
to
be
displaced
nor
live-in
in
a
federally
low
funded
housing
area
would
nonetheless
have
standing
to
challenge
what
was
obviously
going
to
disintegrate
the
quality
of
their
neighborhood
because
of
the
effect
which
those
practices
had
upon
the
quality
of
their
daily
life.
here,
the
petitioners
submit
that
being
compelled
as
a
result
of
the
defendant's
practices
to
continue
to
live
in
parkmerced
under
an
unlawful
condition
to
segregation
constitutes
a
very
real
injury
to
the
quality
of
their
daily
life,
an
injury
which
we
submit
undeniably
merits
protection.
in
an
effort
to
flush
out
the
rather
bare
bones
allegations
or
complaint,
which
course
must
be
taken
as
true
in
the
posture
of
this
case,
we
submitted
in
the
district
court,
and
it
is
part
of
the
record
here,
an
affidavit
of
dr.
alvin
poussaint,
the
associate
dean
of
the
harvard
medical
school.
dr.
poussaint
whose
clinical
practices
have
been
quite
broad
in
this
area,
suggests
indeed
the
persons
living
in
an
environment
such
as
parkmerced
or
any
environment
that
is
artificially
segregated,
suffer
real
injuries,
injuries
which
may
or
may
not
lead
to
clinical
symptoms,
injuries
which
may
or
may
not
result
in
personal
damage,
even
economic
damage,
but
injuries
which
nonetheless
are
very
(inaudible)
mr.
stephen
v.
bomse
i
don't
think
i
can
answer
them
mr.
justice
in
the
abstract.
we
would
suggest
that
there
is
no
right
under
the
constitution
or
at
least
none
has
yet
been
recognized
by
this
court,
per
se,
to
live
in
any
integrated
environment.
the
only
right
we're
asserting
here
is
the
right
to
live
in
an
environment
which
is
not
artificially
segregated
as
the
result
of
practices
affirmatively
proscribed
under
title
8
and
1982.
now
if
your
question
goes
to
the
issue
of
whether
or
not
a
person
in
arkansas
might
have
standing
to
challenge
practice
of
racial
discrimination
at
parkmerced,
i
would
suggest
no,
unless
on
some
set
of
facts
which
i
cannot
hypothesize,
he
could
allege
the
type
of
individualized
grievance
injury
which
the
statue
in
question
were
intended
to
protect.
mr.
stephen
v.
bomse
there
are
of
course
injuries
which
the
constitution
and
the
laws
are
simply
powerless
to
readdress.
under
our
system
some
people
are
rich,
some
are
poor,
some
are
black,
some
are
white,
those
are
not
things
which
the
province
of
the
law
and
neither
the
concern
is
here.
the
only
question
is
if
injuries
result
as
the
result
of
practice
which
are
prescribed
by
federal
law
shouldn't
the
person
who
are
injured
have
a
forum
in
which
they
seek
redress
for
those
and
that's
the
only
issue
which
is
involved
here.
mr.
stephen
v.
bomse
there
is
another
case
in
which
--
mr.
stephen
v.
bomse
that
case
is
now
pending
before
the
district
court,
it
is
in
the
discovery
phase
of
the
litigation.
mr.
stephen
v.
bomse
no,
they
were
not
instituted
simultaneously
at
all.
the
plaintiff's
counsel
in
the
two
cases
are
the
same
as
has
been
pointed
out.
the
issue
that
goes
beyond
the
mere
question
of
injury
is
are
these
plaintiffs,
these
petitioners,
proper
parties
to
challenge,
to
seek
redress
for
the
injuries
that
they
suffered
under
title
8.
it
may
indeed
be
a
concept
as
we
have
noted
of
zone
of
interest
if
that
test
applies.
reviewability
of
that
event
test
which
i
understand
to
be
a
minority
view
on
this
court
as
this
point
applies.
it
may
indeed
that
for
under
the
generalized
language
of
article
3
in
flast
versus
cohen,
it'd
be
a
question
of
nexus,
but
however
one
approaches
that,
it
seems
to
us
and
we
would
submit
to
the
court
that
these
plaintiffs
who
have
both
privity
of
a
state
and
privity
of
contract
with
their
landlord
and
whose
terms
and
conditions
of
tenancy
are
unquestionably
affected
by
their
unlawful
practices
are
within
the
contemplation
of
title
8
and
within
the
contemplation
of
1982
and
accordingly
have
standing.
if
you
recall
the
language
of
title
8,
it
begins
with
the
explicit
declaration
that
it
is
the
policy
of
the
united
states
to
provide
within
constitutional
limitations
for
fair
housing
throughout
the
united
states.
in
terms
of
standing,
it
defines
a
person
aggrieved
as
anyone
who
claims
to
have
been
injured
by
a
discriminatory
housing
practice.
there
is
a
broad
arsenal
of
remedies
provided.
mr.
stephen
v.
bomse
in
other
words,
mr.
chief
justice
i
take
it
you
are
referring
us
now
to
1982
--
mr.
stephen
v.
bomse
--
as
opposed
to
title
8.
under
1982,
again
we
must
be
aware
that
we
have
two
classes
of
plaintiffs.
some
are
negro
tenants
of
parkmerced.
unquestionably,
they
are
being
denied,
at
least
on
our
view,
the
rights
which
are
afforded
to
white
citizens
to
lease
and
hold
property.
white
citizens
are
not
forced
to
live
apart
from
other
members
of
their
race;
black
citizens,
negro
citizens
are.
mr.
stephen
v.
bomse
mr.
chief
justice,
i've
meant
to
respond.
we
do
have
two
petitioners
here,
mrs.
carr
and
mr.
ambery
(ph)
who
are
negroes,
but
as
to
the
others,
we
suggest
that
in
terms
of
a
standing
inquiry,
the
inquiry
is
whether
or
not
a
approximate
result
of
practices
proscribed
by
1982
which
you
just
read,
they
are
directly
injured.
that
was
the
thrust
as
we
read
it
of
the
court
holding
in
the
sullivan
case.
it's
the
thrust
also
of
the
district
court's
decision
which
we
have
decided
in
the
walker
against
pointer.
white
persons
can
be
injured
and
can
therefore
have
standing
under
article
3
as
a
result
of
discriminations
as
in
sullivan,
as
in
walker
as
in
the
other
case
of
bowers
(ph)
against
jackson
which
are
not
directed
against
them.
it's
the
injury
that
they
suffered
and
the
interest
which
they
have
been
redressing
that
injury
which
grants
standing
under
1982.
in
terms
of
the
companion
statute,
for
which
we
are
here,
title
8,
the
language
is
even
more
clear.
we
are
seeking
to
redress
injuries
which
the
petitioners
suffered.
this
is
the
case
involving
personalized
allegation
to
the
injury.
we
claim
to
have
been
injured
as
the
result
of
discriminatory
housing
practices
prescribed
by
the
act.
now
if
we
go
beyond
the
language
which
both
ourselves
and
the
office
of
the
solicitor
general
would
be
before
the
court
in
the
moment,
think
it's
quite
clear
in
support
of
our
standing,
if
we
go
beyond
that
to
the
legislative
history,
we
again
find
i
think,
although
no
comment
at
all
as
to
who
should
or
should
not
have
standing
beyond
the
language
of
the
act.
we
find
two
principles
which
i
submit
militate
strongly
in
favor
of
the
petitioner's
standard
here.
the
first
is
the
continuing
recognition
of
the
fact
that
racial
discrimination
is
a
pernicious
evil
throughout
our
society.
senator
mondale
who
is
the
principal
author
of
the
bill
noted
that
we
must
show
that
we
do
not
intend
to
live
separately
in
this
country,
but
that
we
intend
to
live
together,
that
is
what
this
measure
is
all
about.
now
the
second
thing
that
we
derive
from
the
legislative
history
is
the
fact
that
title
8
was
intended
to
do
something
about
that
discrimination,
not
only
at
the
behest
of
a
negro
individual
who's
denied
housing,
is
intelligent
enough
to
perceive
that
he's
been
denied
because
of
his
race
and
diligent
enough
to
pursue
it,
but
at
the
behest
of
a
group
of
tenants
as
well,
as
long
as
they
are
personally
injured
by
those
practices,
that's
what
the
statute
is
all
about.
it's
about
the
right
--
mr.
stephen
v.
bomse
yes,
i
would
agree
with
the
court,
i
think
that
is
exactly
the
question.
mr.
stephen
v.
bomse
well,
i
think
we
have
come
in
terms
of
the
analysis
of
standing
in
this
country
to
note
that
there
are
injuries
beyond
economic
ones,
which
merit
judicial
protection,
aesthetic
values,
environmental
values,
spiritual
values,
all
have
been
held
properly
justiciable
or
proper
as
a
basis
for
finding
injury
to
assert
standing.
the
question
here
is
not
some
mere
intangible
dissatisfaction
but
it
is
real
damage
to
one's
associational
right
which
we
interpret
to
be
injury
to
the
quality
of
one’s
very
daily
life.
i
can
think
of
no
injury
indeed
which
is
more
substantial
or
more
worthy
of
judicial
protection.
unless
we're
going
to
take
the
view
that
title
8
says
to
the
negro
which
are
the
minorities,
housing
discrimination
is
your
problem.
if
you
want
to
come
in
to
our
neighborhood
and
live
there,
fine,
but
it
isn't
a
problem
which
affects
anybody
else,
nobody
else
can
be
injured
by
it.
i
think
that's
a
notion
which
we
discredited
in
this
country
and
i
think
it's
a
notion
which
this
court
has
regularly
rejected,
which
other
courts
have
regularly
rejected.
this
court
10
years
ago,
in
bailey
against
patterson
noted
the
standing
of
passengers
in
a
public
transportation
system
to
seek
nonsegregated
treatment.
regularly
it
has
been
held
that
white
students
as
well
as
black
have
standing
to
contest
practices
of
discrimination,
practices
which
injured
them
because
they
are
deprived
of
nonsegregated,
non-separated
education.
i
think
we
have
come
and
i
certainly
think
we
should
come
to
the
point
in
terms
of
racial
discrimination
to
recognize
the
fact
that
there
are
real
injuries
and
direct
injuries
and
cognizable
injuries
which
are
suffered
at
any
point
where
a
person
is
as
the
result
of
unlawful
practices
deprived
of
the
right
of
nonsegregated
treatment.
mr.
stephen
v.
bomse
well,
i
think
that
is
of
course
true,
but
one
must
presume
i
think
that
congress
had
in
mind
the
interpretation
that
has
been
given
to
the
term
persons
aggrieved.
the
view
that
has
been
taken
by
enforcement
agency
such
as
the
eeoc
under
the
title
7
interpreting
the
analogous
the
persons
aggrieved
there
and
i
think
when
they
chose
to
use
that
language
in
title
8
in
1968,
they
presumably
were
well
aware
of
what
this
court
had
interpreted
the
term
persons
aggrieved
to
mean,
what
other
courts
had
interpreted
the
term
persons
aggrieved
to
mean.
so
insofar
as
we
derive
anything
from
that
history
i
think
it
certainly
supports
our
standing.
we
would
finally
submit
to
this
court
that
the
standing
of
tenant
should
be
recognized
because
they
are
going
to
be,
perhaps,
the
most
effective
advocates
of
ending
racial
discrimination,
large
apartment
complexes.
they
are
people
with
a
real
continuing
interest
in
those
problems.
they
live
there,
it's
a
continuing
situation
for
them.
mr.
stephen
v.
bomse
yes,
but
the
fact
that
is
one
thing
that,
that
is
one
thing
that
is
about
does
not
in
my
view
suggest
that
it
is
not
about
something
else.
senator
mondale
was
not
at
that
point
discussing
the
question
of
who
had
standing
and
i'll
frankly
admit
to
the
court
as
i
think,
the
respondents
would
as
well,
there
is
no
legislative
history
on
the
precise
question
of
who
has
standing.
all
we
must
do
is
look
to
the
language
that
is
used,
look
to
the
intent
of
the
statute
and
look
to
what
congress
was
attempting
to
accomplish
when
it
enacted
it.
i
think
that
all
of
those
things
point
very
strongly
in
this
case
to
the
fact
that
standing
should
be
recognized.
mr.
stephen
v.
bomse
i
do
not
think
so
mr.
chief
justice.
i
think
that
in
that
case
again,
he
was
talking
about
the
fact
there
should
be
law
enforcement,
and
should
be
enforcement
by
persons
who
are
directly
injured
or
enforcement
on
their
behest
when
they
cannot
afford
it,
but
was
not
suggesting
in
anyway
that
petitioners
here
should
not
have
a
standing.
mr.
stephen
v.
bomse
we
can't
tell
at
this
point.
certainly
the
relief
which
petitioners
seek
for
their
own
personal
injuries,
cannot
be.
for
example,
mrs.
carr
has
been
told
that
her
child
should
have
greater
contact
with
minority
persons
that
he
has
been
psychologically
disadvantage
by
the
lack
of
that.
now
if
that's
an
injury
that's
cognizant
under
the
statute,
she
should
be
entitled
to
seek
redress
for
that
quite
apart
for
many
relief
which
would
be
granted
in
the
burbridge
case.
it's
a
question
of
the
right
of
any
person
who
has
been
injured
to
seek
redress
for
those
injuries
quite
apart
from
the
right
which
other
persons
have.
mr.
stephen
v.
bomse
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
issue
which
we
confront
here
today
is
whether
tenants
at
a
large,
privately
owned
apartment
complex
have
standing
to
challenge
practices
of
racial
discrimination
by
their
landlord,
under
writ
of
the
1968
civil
rights
act,
title
8
thereof
or
42
u.s.c,
section
1982,
the
statute
principally
interpreted
by
this
court
in
its
1968
decision
of
jones
against
maya.
the
petitioners
here
are
both
negro
and
white
residents
of
parkmerced,
a
3500
unit
apartment
complex
in
san
francisco,
california.
they
filed
a
lawsuit
under
title
8
and
under
1982
alleging
that
parkmerced
was
generally
responsible
for
practices
condemned
by
both
of
those
statutes
and
refusing
occupancy
there
to
members
of
the
negro
race,
and
other
minority
races.
their
action
was
against
the
landlords
responsible
for
that
discrimination.
motions
to
dismiss
were
made
in
the
district
court
on
a
variety
of
grounds
and
the
court
granted
those
motions,
limited
however
to
the
question
of
standing
which
is
before
this
court
today.
the
case
then
went
to
the
ninth
circuit
courts
of
appeals
where
the
decision
of
the
district
court
was
affirmed
again,
limited
solely
to
the
question
of
standing.
we
sought
certiorari
and
that
was
granted.
it
is
our
submission
today
that
the
decision
below
should
be
reversed
and
the
petitioners
held
to
have
standing.
in
view
of
the
language
of
the
relevant
statutes,
the
clear
policies
which
they
embody
and
the
national
commitment
which
i
think,
none
of
us
would
reasonably
again
say
minimize
to
eliminate
racial
discrimination
from
housing
not
only
because
that
of
itself
is
a
crucial
problem
to
our
nation
today,
but
because
it
quite
clearly
infects
our
national
life
in
a
variety
of
other
circumstances.
to
recall
only
the
most
obvious
one,
the
terribly
divisive
national
controversy
over
busing
has
mean
to
culminating,
segregation,
and
separation
of
the
races
in
the
schools.
it's
in
large
part
a
product
of
the
fact
that
the
races
in
this
country
leave
apart.
that
fact
has
been
too
well
documented
to
really
be
disputed
here.
it's
been
documented
by
the
united
states
civil
rights
commission
in
its
notion
that
we
are
indeed
moving
towards
two
societies,
they
are
not
speaking,
really
in
a
social
or
any
in
tangible
sense,
we
live
apart.
so
what
is
an
issue
here
is
whether
the
commitment
which
petitioners
submit
is
embodied
in
the
laws
and
issue
title
8
of
1982,
is
going
to
be
broadly
or
narrowly
upheld.
we
submit
it
should
be
the
former.
we
trust
that
any
inquiry
on
the
question
of
standing
begins,
at
least
some
members
of
this
court
would
suggest
ends
with
the
question
of
whether
there
is
injury
in
fact.
that
is
a
test
which
at
least
as
i
read
the
cases
is
the
constitutional
or
article
3
cases
in
controversy.
but
i
don't
think
that
there
is
a
great
dispute
here
over
injury.
this
court
has
noted
in
the
numerous
recent
cases,
including
most
recently
sierra
club
against
morton,
that
their
interest
be
on
mere
economic
ones
which
merit
judicial
protection.
in
sierra
club,
the
court
referred
to
the
environmental
questions
there
in
issue
as
an
important
ingredient
of
the
quality
of
life
in
our
society.
it's
language
which
was
also
used
in
a
very
well
reasoned
opinion
of
the
third
circuit,
involving
title
8
in
part
shannon
versus
hud
in
which
the
third
circuit
suggested
that
the
persons
who
neither
are
going
to
be
displaced
nor
live-in
in
a
federally
low
funded
housing
area
would
nonetheless
have
standing
to
challenge
what
was
obviously
going
to
disintegrate
the
quality
of
their
neighborhood
because
of
the
effect
which
those
practices
had
upon
the
quality
of
their
daily
life.
here,
the
petitioners
submit
that
being
compelled
as
a
result
of
the
defendant's
practices
to
continue
to
live
in
parkmerced
under
an
unlawful
condition
to
segregation
constitutes
a
very
real
injury
to
the
quality
of
their
daily
life,
an
injury
which
we
submit
undeniably
merits
protection.
in
an
effort
to
flush
out
the
rather
bare
bones
allegations
or
complaint,
which
course
must
be
taken
as
true
in
the
posture
of
this
case,
we
submitted
in
the
district
court,
and
it
is
part
of
the
record
here,
an
affidavit
of
dr.
alvin
poussaint,
the
associate
dean
of
the
harvard
medical
school.
dr.
poussaint
whose
clinical
practices
have
been
quite
broad
in
this
area,
suggests
indeed
the
persons
living
in
an
environment
such
as
parkmerced
or
any
environment
that
is
artificially
segregated,
suffer
real
injuries,
injuries
which
may
or
may
not
lead
to
clinical
symptoms,
injuries
which
may
or
may
not
result
in
personal
damage,
even
economic
damage,
but
injuries
which
nonetheless
are
very
(inaudible)
mr.
stephen
v.
bomse
i
don't
think
i
can
answer
them
mr.
justice
in
the
abstract.
we
would
suggest
that
there
is
no
right
under
the
constitution
or
at
least
none
has
yet
been
recognized
by
this
court,
per
se,
to
live
in
any
integrated
environment.
the
only
right
we're
asserting
here
is
the
right
to
live
in
an
environment
which
is
not
artificially
segregated
as
the
result
of
practices
affirmatively
proscribed
under
title
8
and
1982.
now
if
your
question
goes
to
the
issue
of
whether
or
not
a
person
in
arkansas
might
have
standing
to
challenge
practice
of
racial
discrimination
at
parkmerced,
i
would
suggest
no,
unless
on
some
set
of
facts
which
i
cannot
hypothesize,
he
could
allege
the
type
of
individualized
grievance
injury
which
the
statue
in
question
were
intended
to
protect.
mr.
stephen
v.
bomse
there
are
of
course
injuries
which
the
constitution
and
the
laws
are
simply
powerless
to
readdress.
under
our
system
some
people
are
rich,
some
are
poor,
some
are
black,
some
are
white,
those
are
not
things
which
the
province
of
the
law
and
neither
the
concern
is
here.
the
only
question
is
if
injuries
result
as
the
result
of
practice
which
are
prescribed
by
federal
law
shouldn't
the
person
who
are
injured
have
a
forum
in
which
they
seek
redress
for
those
and
that's
the
only
issue
which
is
involved
here.
mr.
stephen
v.
bomse
there
is
another
case
in
which
--
mr.
stephen
v.
bomse
that
case
is
now
pending
before
the
district
court,
it
is
in
the
discovery
phase
of
the
litigation.
mr.
stephen
v.
bomse
no,
they
were
not
instituted
simultaneously
at
all.
the
plaintiff's
counsel
in
the
two
cases
are
the
same
as
has
been
pointed
out.
the
issue
that
goes
beyond
the
mere
question
of
injury
is
are
these
plaintiffs,
these
petitioners,
proper
parties
to
challenge,
to
seek
redress
for
the
injuries
that
they
suffered
under
title
8.
it
may
indeed
be
a
concept
as
we
have
noted
of
zone
of
interest
if
that
test
applies.
reviewability
of
that
event
test
which
i
understand
to
be
a
minority
view
on
this
court
as
this
point
applies.
it
may
indeed
that
for
under
the
generalized
language
of
article
3
in
flast
versus
cohen,
it'd
be
a
question
of
nexus,
but
however
one
approaches
that,
it
seems
to
us
and
we
would
submit
to
the
court
that
these
plaintiffs
who
have
both
privity
of
a
state
and
privity
of
contract
with
their
landlord
and
whose
terms
and
conditions
of
tenancy
are
unquestionably
affected
by
their
unlawful
practices
are
within
the
contemplation
of
title
8
and
within
the
contemplation
of
1982
and
accordingly
have
standing.
if
you
recall
the
language
of
title
8,
it
begins
with
the
explicit
declaration
that
it
is
the
policy
of
the
united
states
to
provide
within
constitutional
limitations
for
fair
housing
throughout
the
united
states.
in
terms
of
standing,
it
defines
a
person
aggrieved
as
anyone
who
claims
to
have
been
injured
by
a
discriminatory
housing
practice.
there
is
a
broad
arsenal
of
remedies
provided.
mr.
stephen
v.
bomse
in
other
words,
mr.
chief
justice
i
take
it
you
are
referring
us
now
to
1982
--
mr.
stephen
v.
bomse
--
as
opposed
to
title
8.
under
1982,
again
we
must
be
aware
that
we
have
two
classes
of
plaintiffs.
some
are
negro
tenants
of
parkmerced.
unquestionably,
they
are
being
denied,
at
least
on
our
view,
the
rights
which
are
afforded
to
white
citizens
to
lease
and
hold
property.
white
citizens
are
not
forced
to
live
apart
from
other
members
of
their
race;
black
citizens,
negro
citizens
are.
mr.
stephen
v.
bomse
mr.
chief
justice,
i've
meant
to
respond.
we
do
have
two
petitioners
here,
mrs.
carr
and
mr.
ambery
(ph)
who
are
negroes,
but
as
to
the
others,
we
suggest
that
in
terms
of
a
standing
inquiry,
the
inquiry
is
whether
or
not
a
approximate
result
of
practices
proscribed
by
1982
which
you
just
read,
they
are
directly
injured.
that
was
the
thrust
as
we
read
it
of
the
court
holding
in
the
sullivan
case.
it's
the
thrust
also
of
the
district
court's
decision
which
we
have
decided
in
the
walker
against
pointer.
white
persons
can
be
injured
and
can
therefore
have
standing
under
article
3
as
a
result
of
discriminations
as
in
sullivan,
as
in
walker
as
in
the
other
case
of
bowers
(ph)
against
jackson
which
are
not
directed
against
them.
it's
the
injury
that
they
suffered
and
the
interest
which
they
have
been
redressing
that
injury
which
grants
standing
under
1982.
in
terms
of
the
companion
statute,
for
which
we
are
here,
title
8,
the
language
is
even
more
clear.
we
are
seeking
to
redress
injuries
which
the
petitioners
suffered.
this
is
the
case
involving
personalized
allegation
to
the
injury.
we
claim
to
have
been
injured
as
the
result
of
discriminatory
housing
practices
prescribed
by
the
act.
now
if
we
go
beyond
the
language
which
both
ourselves
and
the
office
of
the
solicitor
general
would
be
before
the
court
in
the
moment,
think
it's
quite
clear
in
support
of
our
standing,
if
we
go
beyond
that
to
the
legislative
history,
we
again
find
i
think,
although
no
comment
at
all
as
to
who
should
or
should
not
have
standing
beyond
the
language
of
the
act.
we
find
two
principles
which
i
submit
militate
strongly
in
favor
of
the
petitioner's
standard
here.
the
first
is
the
continuing
recognition
of
the
fact
that
racial
discrimination
is
a
pernicious
evil
throughout
our
society.
senator
mondale
who
is
the
principal
author
of
the
bill
noted
that
we
must
show
that
we
do
not
intend
to
live
separately
in
this
country,
but
that
we
intend
to
live
together,
that
is
what
this
measure
is
all
about.
now
the
second
thing
that
we
derive
from
the
legislative
history
is
the
fact
that
title
8
was
intended
to
do
something
about
that
discrimination,
not
only
at
the
behest
of
a
negro
individual
who's
denied
housing,
is
intelligent
enough
to
perceive
that
he's
been
denied
because
of
his
race
and
diligent
enough
to
pursue
it,
but
at
the
behest
of
a
group
of
tenants
as
well,
as
long
as
they
are
personally
injured
by
those
practices,
that's
what
the
statute
is
all
about.
it's
about
the
right
--
mr.
stephen
v.
bomse
yes,
i
would
agree
with
the
court,
i
think
that
is
exactly
the
question.
mr.
stephen
v.
bomse
well,
i
think
we
have
come
in
terms
of
the
analysis
of
standing
in
this
country
to
note
that
there
are
injuries
beyond
economic
ones,
which
merit
judicial
protection,
aesthetic
values,
environmental
values,
spiritual
values,
all
have
been
held
properly
justiciable
or
proper
as
a
basis
for
finding
injury
to
assert
standing.
the
question
here
is
not
some
mere
intangible
dissatisfaction
but
it
is
real
damage
to
one's
associational
right
which
we
interpret
to
be
injury
to
the
quality
of
one’s
very
daily
life.
i
can
think
of
no
injury
indeed
which
is
more
substantial
or
more
worthy
of
judicial
protection.
unless
we're
going
to
take
the
view
that
title
8
says
to
the
negro
which
are
the
minorities,
housing
discrimination
is
your
problem.
if
you
want
to
come
in
to
our
neighborhood
and
live
there,
fine,
but
it
isn't
a
problem
which
affects
anybody
else,
nobody
else
can
be
injured
by
it.
i
think
that's
a
notion
which
we
discredited
in
this
country
and
i
think
it's
a
notion
which
this
court
has
regularly
rejected,
which
other
courts
have
regularly
rejected.
this
court
10
years
ago,
in
bailey
against
patterson
noted
the
standing
of
passengers
in
a
public
transportation
system
to
seek
nonsegregated
treatment.
regularly
it
has
been
held
that
white
students
as
well
as
black
have
standing
to
contest
practices
of
discrimination,
practices
which
injured
them
because
they
are
deprived
of
nonsegregated,
non-separated
education.
i
think
we
have
come
and
i
certainly
think
we
should
come
to
the
point
in
terms
of
racial
discrimination
to
recognize
the
fact
that
there
are
real
injuries
and
direct
injuries
and
cognizable
injuries
which
are
suffered
at
any
point
where
a
person
is
as
the
result
of
unlawful
practices
deprived
of
the
right
of
nonsegregated
treatment.
mr.
stephen
v.
bomse
well,
i
think
that
is
of
course
true,
but
one
must
presume
i
think
that
congress
had
in
mind
the
interpretation
that
has
been
given
to
the
term
persons
aggrieved.
the
view
that
has
been
taken
by
enforcement
agency
such
as
the
eeoc
under
the
title
7
interpreting
the
analogous
the
persons
aggrieved
there
and
i
think
when
they
chose
to
use
that
language
in
title
8
in
1968,
they
presumably
were
well
aware
of
what
this
court
had
interpreted
the
term
persons
aggrieved
to
mean,
what
other
courts
had
interpreted
the
term
persons
aggrieved
to
mean.
so
insofar
as
we
derive
anything
from
that
history
i
think
it
certainly
supports
our
standing.
we
would
finally
submit
to
this
court
that
the
standing
of
tenant
should
be
recognized
because
they
are
going
to
be,
perhaps,
the
most
effective
advocates
of
ending
racial
discrimination,
large
apartment
complexes.
they
are
people
with
a
real
continuing
interest
in
those
problems.
they
live
there,
it's
a
continuing
situation
for
them.
mr.
stephen
v.
bomse
yes,
but
the
fact
that
is
one
thing
that,
that
is
one
thing
that
is
about
does
not
in
my
view
suggest
that
it
is
not
about
something
else.
senator
mondale
was
not
at
that
point
discussing
the
question
of
who
had
standing
and
i'll
frankly
admit
to
the
court
as
i
think,
the
respondents
would
as
well,
there
is
no
legislative
history
on
the
precise
question
of
who
has
standing.
all
we
must
do
is
look
to
the
language
that
is
used,
look
to
the
intent
of
the
statute
and
look
to
what
congress
was
attempting
to
accomplish
when
it
enacted
it.
i
think
that
all
of
those
things
point
very
strongly
in
this
case
to
the
fact
that
standing
should
be
recognized.
mr.
stephen
v.
bomse
i
do
not
think
so
mr.
chief
justice.
i
think
that
in
that
case
again,
he
was
talking
about
the
fact
there
should
be
law
enforcement,
and
should
be
enforcement
by
persons
who
are
directly
injured
or
enforcement
on
their
behest
when
they
cannot
afford
it,
but
was
not
suggesting
in
anyway
that
petitioners
here
should
not
have
a
standing.
mr.
stephen
v.
bomse
we
can't
tell
at
this
point.
certainly
the
relief
which
petitioners
seek
for
their
own
personal
injuries,
cannot
be.
for
example,
mrs.
carr
has
been
told
that
her
child
should
have
greater
contact
with
minority
persons
that
he
has
been
psychologically
disadvantage
by
the
lack
of
that.
now
if
that's
an
injury
that's
cognizant
under
the
statute,
she
should
be
entitled
to
seek
redress
for
that
quite
apart
for
many
relief
which
would
be
granted
in
the
burbridge
case.
it's
a
question
of
the
right
of
any
person
who
has
been
injured
to
seek
redress
for
those
injuries
quite
apart
from
the
right
which
other
persons
have.
