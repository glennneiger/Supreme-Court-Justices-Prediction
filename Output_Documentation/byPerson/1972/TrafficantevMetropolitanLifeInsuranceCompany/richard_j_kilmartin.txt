mr.
richard
j.
kilmartin
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
we
have
here
under
consideration
today
what
i
believe
is
an
extremely
practical
problem
rather
than
an
emotional
problem
that
has
been
presented.
neither
of
the
defendants
would
deny
that
segregation
or
discrimination
is
a
pervasive
evil,
but
that
is
not
the
question
presented.
as
i
indicate,
we
have
nothing
but
a
practical
problem.
is
this
court
going
to
authorize
tenants
of
an
apartment
complex,
incumbent
tenants
to
sue
their
landlord
for
injuries
which
they
allege
arise
out
of
the
civil
rights
act
of
1968
and
the
civil
rights
act
of
1866?
this
court
has
never
gone
that
far
before
and
i
submit
should
not
in
this
case.
it
will
submitted
that
the
decision
of
the
ninth
circuit
was
absolutely
correct.
i
believe
preliminarily
before
considering
the
question
of
standing,
we
should
put
the
interest
of
the
united
states
in
focus.
the
contentions
of
the
united
states
tracked
and
parallel
almost
exactly
that
of
the
petitioners,
but
i
believe
that
their
motivation
for
joining
with
the
petitioners
is
different
and
i
believe
that's
reflected
in
their
briefs.
their
briefs
assert
they
have
a
very
small
civil
rights
staff
and
an
even
smaller
housing
staff
and
therefore,
they
need
whatever
help
they
can
get
from
the
private
sector
and
that
is
certainly
understandable.
if
they
do
have
--
indeed
have
a
small
staff
and
are
over
worked,
they
should
have
assistance
of
the
private
sector.
however,
we
submit
that
denial
of
standing
to
these
plaintiffs
is
not
going
to
detract
one
bit
from
the
enforcement
or
from
the
assistance
legitimately
available
to
the
united
states
in
this
type
of
case.
there
is
a
complete
arsenal
of
federal
authority
provided
by
title
8
which
is
applicable
to
this
kind
of
a
situation.
the
implementation
of
national
policy
in
providing
fair
housing
will
not
be
affected
at
all.
as
partial
proof
of
this,
i
refer
to
the
case
that
justice
blackmun,
mr.
justice
blackmun
referred
to
and
that
is
burbridge
versus
parkmerced
corporation.
while
as
that
case
might
not
be
a
blood
brother
to
this
case,
it's
certainly
a
first
cousin.
it
was
filed
just
15
days
after
the
district
court
dismissed
this
case
for
lack
of
standing.
it
was
filed
by
the
same
attorneys
as
they
are
representing
the
plaintiffs
here.
it
has
virtually
identical
allegations.
whenever
we
appear
in
the
district
court,
the
plaintiffs
in
this
case
are
there
to
observe
and
it
would
be
folly
to
assume
that
they
are
not,
in
fact,
related.
in
each
of
those
cases,
in
that
case
rather,
the
plaintiffs
are
five
negroes,
one
married
couple
and
three
other
individuals,
each
of
whom
claims
to
have
been
a
direct
victim
of
a
discriminatory
housing
practice.
that
they
applied
for
apartments
and
that
for
some
reason
or
other
they
were
refused.
mr.
richard
j.
kilmartin
none,
whatever,
your
honor.
we
did
not
challenge
their
standing
in
the
lower
court.
we
are
proceeding
with
that
case,
discovery
proceedings
are
pending
and
in
fact,
the
trial
date
has
been
set.
the
trial
date
is
april
29,
i
believe
it
is,
with
certain
pre-trial
dates
in
the
intervention
and
so
that
case
will
be
disposed
off
shortly.
in
addition,
it
purports
to
be
a
class
action
and
while
it
has
not
qualified
as
such
as
yet
under
rule
23,
it
is
proceeding
in
that
context
and
it
is
anticipated
that
in
due
course
a
motion
to
qualify
it
as
a
class
action
will
be
filed.
i
like
the
court
to
keep
in
mind
what
the
plaintiffs
have
asked
this
court
to
do
and
what
they
have
asked
the
district
court
to
do.
in
their
prayer
for
relief,
they
asked
the
court
to
fashion
a
decree,
an
adjunctive
decree
which
would
be
virtually
binding
on
no
one
except
perhaps
the
defendant.
this
distinct
possibility
occurs.
keep
in
mind
that
this
action
is
not
a
class
action.
this
is
an
action
by
individuals
and
individuals
alone
who
sue
in
their
own
right
and
in
their
own
right
alone.
and
if
i
might
state
at
this
point
parenthetically
because
i
think
it's
important
in
response
to
the
petitioners'
contention
that
somehow
incumbent
tenants
are
the
ones
that
should
assert
the
rights
under
this
act.
i
will
advise
the
court
at
this
time
that
there
were
six
plaintiffs.
there
were
two
plaintiffs
that
filed
the
suit
and
there
were
four
individual
plaintiffs
in
intervention
together
with
an
unidentified
committee.
the
four
individual
plaintiffs
have
since
long
departed,
parkmerced,
have
moved
their
tenancy,
demonstrating
the
transiency
of
tenancies
and
i
can
--
fail
to
see
what
state
they
would
have
in
the
outcome
of
this
controversy
at
this
time.
while
we
haven't
raised
it,
it
might
well
be
moot
as
to
those
four
tenants
who
no
longer
live
there.
one
of
them,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
has
moved
as
far
as
rio
de
janeiro.
they
would
left
the
personal
stake
in
the
outcome
of
the
controversy
which
this
court
has
required
in
its
decision
in
baker
versus
carr.
if
however,
getting
to
trial
on
a
case
such
as
this,
the
defendants
won,
that
is
if
the
defendant
landlord
won
the
case,
it
certainly
wouldn't
be
binding
upon
the
next
individual
who
would
come
along
and
assert
his
personal
value
preference
of
phrase
used
by
this
court,
most
recently
in
sierra
club
versus
morton.
whether
his
grievance
would
be
real
or
imagined,
he'd
have
the
right
to
assert
it
because
there
would
be
no
res
judicata
effect
to
a
decision
such
as
this.
if
on
the
other
hand,
the
plaintiffs
were
granted
any
measure
of
relief,
it
certainly
wouldn't
be
binding
upon
the
next
group
of
plaintiffs
who
wanted
to
come
in
and
assert
what
they
thought
was
the
proper
racial
mix
of
parkmerced
or
any
complex
and
it's
with
that
background,
your
honor,
that
we
proceed
to
the
question
of
standing.
we
just
do
not
feel
that
congress
ever
envisioned
that
kind
of
profound
disorder
in
creating
certain
rights
and
remedies
in
the
housing
field.
as
we
have
indicated,
now
i
think
as
both
sides
concede
the
standing
issue
in
this
case
is
not
at
all
complex,
in
fact,
it's
quite
simple.
the
length
of
the
briefs
and
the
plethora
of
cases
that
have
been
cited
on
this
subject
demonstrate
in
my
judgment
one
thing
and
that
is
the
futility
of
attempting
to
assign
to
a
statute
a
task
or
a
burden
that
it
was
never
meant
to
carry
and
i
think
that
is
the
thrust
of
the
petitioners'
position
here.
they
are
trying
to
derive
from
title
8
standing
where
none
was
ever
intended
and
the
statute
simply
won't
carry
it.
stripped
to
its
essentials,
the
issue
is
simply
this;
did
congress
intend
that
plaintiffs
such
as
this,
that
is
incumbent
tenants
have
standing
to
complain
of
the
policies
of
their
landlord
and
we
submit
that
it
clearly
did
not.
mr.
richard
j.
kilmartin
yes,
sir.
mr.
richard
j.
kilmartin
yes,
she
is
sir.
mr.
richard
j.
kilmartin
i
would
say
as
the
statute
stands
now,
yes
it
would,
but
certainly
the
dependent
relative
would
have
every
right
to
assert
his
or
her
rights
under
the
statute.
so
that
if,
in
fact,
the
discriminatory
practice
was
practiced
against
that
person,
there
would
be
a
remedy
for
it.
it
would
be
remedy
under
both
federal
and
state
laws
as
a
matter
of
fact.
california
has
a
comprehensive
public
--
fair
housing
statute
of
its
own
as
well
as
--
mr.
richard
j.
kilmartin
i
would
say,
your
honor,
that
the
statute
would
not
extend
to
that
situation,
but
once
again
i
believe
it
would
be
academic
because
of
the
fact
that
the
person
himself
or
herself
would
have
direct
rights
under
the
act
and
could
obtain
the
apartment.
mr.
richard
j.
kilmartin
that's
correct.
mr.
richard
j.
kilmartin
that's
correct,
your
honor,
or
mrs.
carr
to
take
her
dependent
relative
down
to
the
office
of
hud
to
initiate
administrative
proceedings
under
810
of
the
fair
housing
act
and
if
that
failed
and
then
that
relative
could
file
an
action
either
in
federal
or
state
court
under
section
812.
the
solicitor
general
has
eluded
to
the
fact
that
the
only
thing
involved
in
this
case
is
two
or
three
tenants
and
we
do
not
go
beyond
that,
but
the
problem
has
much
greater
dimension
than
that.
it
has
a
very
significant
effect
upon
landlords
and
it
has
a
--
as
a
practical
matter,
the
decision
of
this
court
is
going
to
go
far
beyond
if
it
grant
standing,
far
beyond
these
individual
tenants.
and
i
would
like
to
give
you
just
a
thumbnail
sketch
of
what
parkmerced
is
because
you
probably
--
maybe
some
of
you
have
seen
it,
maybe
not.
it
is
a
large
3500
apartment
complex
of
tower
buildings
and
garden
apartments
located
on
about
a
150
acres
in
the
south
west
portion
of
san
francisco.
it's
near
lake
merced.
immediately
adjacent
to
it
to
the
north
is
san
francisco
state
college
and
its
campus
which
has
in
the
neighborhood
of
20,000
students.
about
a
half
a
mile
to
the
north
of
that
is
another
complex
totally
--
apartment
complex,
totally
unrelated
to
parkmerced
called
stonestown.
immediately
to
the
south
within
a
mile
is
another
large
complex
of
apartments,
several
thousand
called
west
lake.
immediately
to
the
east
of
parkmerced
are
hundreds
of
single
family
dwellings.
we
submit
that
within
a
one
mile
radius
of
parkmerced
and
we
don't
even
have
to
go
to
arkansas,
but
there
would
be
nothing
if
this
court
granted
standing
to
these
tenants
to
prevent
the
person
in
the
house
across
the
street
from
asserting
his
views
or
the
apartment
dweller
in
the
next
complex
or
perhaps
even
the
state
college
student
who
spends
eight
hours
of
his
day,
each
day,
immediately
next
to
parkmerced.
we
submit
that
would
be
a
logical
extension
and
a
logical
consequence
of
granting
standing
to
this
type
of
plaintiff
in
this
case.
i
would
like
to
the
court
to
keep
in
mind
that
the
thrust
of
the
plaintiffs'
arguments
are
that
they
are
denied
interracial
association.
that
is
not
one
of
the
rights,
that
is
protected
by
the
statute.
they
alleged
that
their
injuries
are
social
and
professional
in
that
they
are
deprived
of
the
right
to
benefit
from
association
with
different
races,
but
the
complaints
are
silent
on
these
points.
there
is
no
allegation
in
any
complaint
that
parkmerced,
metropolitan
life
or
the
present
owner,
parkmerced
corporation
has
a
gate
at
the
door
and
blocks
any
business
or
social
visitor
to
these
plaintiffs
from
entering
his
apartment
or
coming
to
visit
him
or
from
associating
with
him
in
anyway.
the
complaint
is
devoid
of
any
such
allegations
and
the
challenge
that
they
are
denied
interracial
association
simply
fails.
the
streets
of
parkmerced
are
public,
although
the
development
is
private.
anybody
that
wants
to
come
there
can
come
at
anytime
and
visit
any
tenant
in
any
apartment
that
as
long
as
he
is,
of
course,
invited
by
the
tenant
himself.
so
there
is
absolutely
no
interference
with
free
interracial
association
nor
is
there
any
allegation
to
that
effect
in
the
complaint.
in
the
case
of
data
processing
against
camp,
mr.
justice
douglas
started
out
with
the
phrase
of
generalizations
about
standing
to
sue
are
largely
worthless
as
such.
i
believe
that
is
certainly
true
and
i
think
this
case
demonstrates
it.
however,
we
start
with
in
every
standing
case,
the
article
3
case
or
controversy
test.
the
article
3
case
or
controversy
requirement.
i
want
the
court
to
understand
clearly
here
and
now
that
what
the
petitioners'
counsel
said
and
what
the
attorney
general
implied
is
and
implies
in
their
briefs
that
is
that
these
people
have
suffered
injury,
in
fact,
and
were
therefore
automatically
over
the
hurdle
of
article
3
is
simply
not
so.
we
do
not
admit
that.
as
this
court
pointed
out
in
sierra
club
and
as
i
read
sierra
club,
the
injury
in
fact,
if
it
is
necessary,
has
to
be
in
cognizable
injury
in
fact.
it's
not
as
mr.
chief
justice
suggested
just
a
racial
slur
an
insult,
a
broken
leg
or
anything
else
but
it
has
to
be
a
cognizable
injury,
in
fact,
under
the
statutes
that
are
being
discussed
--
mr.
richard
j.
kilmartin
no,
no,
your
honor,
i
don't
suggest
that
at
all.
i
suggest
that
all
of
the
arguments
that
have
been
presented
by
the
petitioner
should
be
addressed
to
congress
if
they
want
to
grant
standing
to
people
such
as
these
and
i
would
assume
the
constitutionality
of
such
if
it
were
passed
under
this
court's
holding
in
jones
v.
mayer.
mr.
richard
j.
kilmartin
yes,
in
data
processing
and
as
well
as
other
cases,
but
data
processing
zeros
in
on
it,
as
i
understand
it,
as
i
read
it,
the
first
inquiry
is
there
a
case
or
controversy
and
to
find
that
there
is
a
case
or
controversy,
you
have
to
have
an
injury,
in
fact,
to
the
person
complaining,
that's
the
first
inquiry.
but
as
this
court
pointed
out
in
sierra
club,
it's
not
just
an
abstract
injury,
in
fact.
it
has
to
be
an
injury
cognizable
under
the
statutes
that
are
under
discussion
and
in
this
case,
those
statutes
are
title
8
and
section
1982,
now
we
submit
that
the
injuries
asserted
here,
the
injuries,
in
fact,
that
are
asserted
by
these
petitioners
are
not
the
injuries
contemplated
by
title
8
or
1982.
mr.
richard
j.
kilmartin
hud
entertained
these
complaints?
mr.
richard
j.
kilmartin
well,
yes
he
did
say
that,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
j.
kilmartin
well,
i
think
there
is
more
committed
to
hud
under
title
8
than
is
committed
to
private
plaintiffs,
your
honor.
i
think
that's
the
answer,
they
have
great
powers,
they
have
investigative
powers,
for
example.
i
think
that
hud
is
empowered
to
investigate
just
about
any
complaint
that
comes
into
its
office
and
they
have
subpoena
power.
they
don't
have
much
enforcement
power
but
they
do
have
a
lot
of
powers
to
investigate
for
the
purpose
of
recommending
to
congress.
mr.
richard
j.
kilmartin
i
think
that's
the
thrust
of
their
argument,
your
honor,
and
that's
what
i
mentioned
at
the
outset
of
my
remarks,
but
they
will
not
be
denied
the
aid
of
the
private
sector
in
my
opinion,
one
with
by
denying
standing
to
these
plaintiffs
because
as
demonstrated,
the
minute
these
plaintiffs
fail
there
is
always
the
burbridge
type
of
plaintiffs,
who
will
be
collected
and
will
file
a
suit
and
in
those
cases,
a
case
such
as
burbridge,
you
have
issues
that
are
real,
that
are
live,
not
just
abstract
contentions
such
as
the
petitioners
play
--
present
here
but
you
have
real
live
issues.
for
example,
in
the
burbridge
case,
the
complaints
of
discrimination
are
subject
to
rectification.
they
can
sit
down,
these
tenants
can
sit
down
with
the
landlord
and
they
can
talk
across
the
table
and
as
was
the
case
in
this
situation,
they
were
all
offered
apartments.
mr.
richard
j.
kilmartin
by
these
plaintiffs,
you
are
referring
to
the
trafficante,
your
honor?
mr.
richard
j.
kilmartin
i
would
say,
no,
butt
their
redress
would
be
to
go
and
collect
the
plaintiffs
who
have
been
discriminated
against
and
let
them
file
an
action
on
their
own,
in
their
own
name.
mr.
richard
j.
kilmartin
that's
correct,
that's
correct.
we
believe,
your
honor,
to
achieve
that
result,
you
would
have
to
have
a
standing
statute
far
beyond
what
we
have
in
this
case.
we
think
1982
is
clear
on
its
face
and
i
believe
that
this
court
in
its
decision
in
sierra
club
posited
the
meaning
of
that
section
quite
clearly
when
it
said
hurd
versus
hodge,
it's
an
earlier
decision
of
the
court,
squarely
held
therefore
that
a
negro
citizen
who
is
denied
the
opportunity
to
purchase
the
home
he
wants
solely
because
of
his
race
and
color,
has
suffered
the
kind
of
injury
that
1982
was
designed
to
prevent.
that
is
the
person
directly
affected
and
not
the
person
who
was
on
the
other
side
of
the
legal
coin
so
to
speak
attempting
to
assert
the
rights
of
somebody
else
and
in
title
8,
i
believe
it
is
even
clearer
because
when
you
track
the
sections
of
title
8
and
correlate
them,
it
seems
to
be
crystal
clear
that
the
only
ones
and
as
held
by
the
ninth
circuit
and
the
district
court,
the
only
ones
who
were
the
intended
beneficiaries
of
that
act
work
the
persons
who
were
directly
discriminated
against
and
i
refer
the
court
specifically
to
those
portions
of
the
act,
3610,
3602
f
and
3604
and
3612.
mr.
richard
j.
kilmartin
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
j.
kilmartin
well,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
j.
kilmartin
yes,
i
think
so
to
put
it
in
proper
context,
we
would
have
to
know
exactly
what
hud
did
with
such
complaints
and
what
they
intended
to
do
with
them
or
what
they
are
trying
to
do.
their
conciliations
and
persuasion
powers
are
virtually
unlimited
in
that
sense.
mr.
richard
j.
kilmartin
well,
i
--
that's
(voice
overlap)
mr.
richard
j.
kilmartin
that's
right,
but
i
think
that
hud
could
accept
--
to
illustrate
by
exaggeration,
hud
could
accept
it
in
informative
context.
mr.
richard
j.
kilmartin
that
is
correct,
i
suggest
that
also.
and
i
would
like
to
draw
the
court's
attention
to
the
specific
provisions
of
3610
and
3612
which
when
authorizing
suit
state
that
the
suit
maybe
filed
to
enforce
the
rights
granted
or
protected
by
this
sub
chapter.
in
3612,
the
rights
granted
by
sections
3604
maybe
enforced
by
civil
actions,
the
rights
granted
not
just
any
old
right,
but
the
rights
granted
by
3604.
the
rights
granted
by
3604
which
were
at
issue
in
this
case
are
(a)
the
right
to
rent
an
apartment
without
being
discriminated
against
because
of
race,
(b)
the
right
to
have
a
landlord,
not
make
a
misrepresentation
to
you
that
the
apartment
is
or
is
not
available
and
three
the
right
to
rent
the
apartment
on
the
same
basis
as
anybody
else
and
receive
the
same
services.
those
are
the
rights
that
this
act
creates,
those
are
the
rights
that
this
act
protects,.
those
are
the
rights
that
are
not
involved
in
this
action.
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
j.
kilmartin
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
we
have
here
under
consideration
today
what
i
believe
is
an
extremely
practical
problem
rather
than
an
emotional
problem
that
has
been
presented.
neither
of
the
defendants
would
deny
that
segregation
or
discrimination
is
a
pervasive
evil,
but
that
is
not
the
question
presented.
as
i
indicate,
we
have
nothing
but
a
practical
problem.
is
this
court
going
to
authorize
tenants
of
an
apartment
complex,
incumbent
tenants
to
sue
their
landlord
for
injuries
which
they
allege
arise
out
of
the
civil
rights
act
of
1968
and
the
civil
rights
act
of
1866?
this
court
has
never
gone
that
far
before
and
i
submit
should
not
in
this
case.
it
will
submitted
that
the
decision
of
the
ninth
circuit
was
absolutely
correct.
i
believe
preliminarily
before
considering
the
question
of
standing,
we
should
put
the
interest
of
the
united
states
in
focus.
the
contentions
of
the
united
states
tracked
and
parallel
almost
exactly
that
of
the
petitioners,
but
i
believe
that
their
motivation
for
joining
with
the
petitioners
is
different
and
i
believe
that's
reflected
in
their
briefs.
their
briefs
assert
they
have
a
very
small
civil
rights
staff
and
an
even
smaller
housing
staff
and
therefore,
they
need
whatever
help
they
can
get
from
the
private
sector
and
that
is
certainly
understandable.
if
they
do
have
--
indeed
have
a
small
staff
and
are
over
worked,
they
should
have
assistance
of
the
private
sector.
however,
we
submit
that
denial
of
standing
to
these
plaintiffs
is
not
going
to
detract
one
bit
from
the
enforcement
or
from
the
assistance
legitimately
available
to
the
united
states
in
this
type
of
case.
there
is
a
complete
arsenal
of
federal
authority
provided
by
title
8
which
is
applicable
to
this
kind
of
a
situation.
the
implementation
of
national
policy
in
providing
fair
housing
will
not
be
affected
at
all.
as
partial
proof
of
this,
i
refer
to
the
case
that
justice
blackmun,
mr.
justice
blackmun
referred
to
and
that
is
burbridge
versus
parkmerced
corporation.
while
as
that
case
might
not
be
a
blood
brother
to
this
case,
it's
certainly
a
first
cousin.
it
was
filed
just
15
days
after
the
district
court
dismissed
this
case
for
lack
of
standing.
it
was
filed
by
the
same
attorneys
as
they
are
representing
the
plaintiffs
here.
it
has
virtually
identical
allegations.
whenever
we
appear
in
the
district
court,
the
plaintiffs
in
this
case
are
there
to
observe
and
it
would
be
folly
to
assume
that
they
are
not,
in
fact,
related.
in
each
of
those
cases,
in
that
case
rather,
the
plaintiffs
are
five
negroes,
one
married
couple
and
three
other
individuals,
each
of
whom
claims
to
have
been
a
direct
victim
of
a
discriminatory
housing
practice.
that
they
applied
for
apartments
and
that
for
some
reason
or
other
they
were
refused.
mr.
richard
j.
kilmartin
none,
whatever,
your
honor.
we
did
not
challenge
their
standing
in
the
lower
court.
we
are
proceeding
with
that
case,
discovery
proceedings
are
pending
and
in
fact,
the
trial
date
has
been
set.
the
trial
date
is
april
29,
i
believe
it
is,
with
certain
pre-trial
dates
in
the
intervention
and
so
that
case
will
be
disposed
off
shortly.
in
addition,
it
purports
to
be
a
class
action
and
while
it
has
not
qualified
as
such
as
yet
under
rule
23,
it
is
proceeding
in
that
context
and
it
is
anticipated
that
in
due
course
a
motion
to
qualify
it
as
a
class
action
will
be
filed.
i
like
the
court
to
keep
in
mind
what
the
plaintiffs
have
asked
this
court
to
do
and
what
they
have
asked
the
district
court
to
do.
in
their
prayer
for
relief,
they
asked
the
court
to
fashion
a
decree,
an
adjunctive
decree
which
would
be
virtually
binding
on
no
one
except
perhaps
the
defendant.
this
distinct
possibility
occurs.
keep
in
mind
that
this
action
is
not
a
class
action.
this
is
an
action
by
individuals
and
individuals
alone
who
sue
in
their
own
right
and
in
their
own
right
alone.
and
if
i
might
state
at
this
point
parenthetically
because
i
think
it's
important
in
response
to
the
petitioners'
contention
that
somehow
incumbent
tenants
are
the
ones
that
should
assert
the
rights
under
this
act.
i
will
advise
the
court
at
this
time
that
there
were
six
plaintiffs.
there
were
two
plaintiffs
that
filed
the
suit
and
there
were
four
individual
plaintiffs
in
intervention
together
with
an
unidentified
committee.
the
four
individual
plaintiffs
have
since
long
departed,
parkmerced,
have
moved
their
tenancy,
demonstrating
the
transiency
of
tenancies
and
i
can
--
fail
to
see
what
state
they
would
have
in
the
outcome
of
this
controversy
at
this
time.
while
we
haven't
raised
it,
it
might
well
be
moot
as
to
those
four
tenants
who
no
longer
live
there.
one
of
them,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
has
moved
as
far
as
rio
de
janeiro.
they
would
left
the
personal
stake
in
the
outcome
of
the
controversy
which
this
court
has
required
in
its
decision
in
baker
versus
carr.
if
however,
getting
to
trial
on
a
case
such
as
this,
the
defendants
won,
that
is
if
the
defendant
landlord
won
the
case,
it
certainly
wouldn't
be
binding
upon
the
next
individual
who
would
come
along
and
assert
his
personal
value
preference
of
phrase
used
by
this
court,
most
recently
in
sierra
club
versus
morton.
whether
his
grievance
would
be
real
or
imagined,
he'd
have
the
right
to
assert
it
because
there
would
be
no
res
judicata
effect
to
a
decision
such
as
this.
if
on
the
other
hand,
the
plaintiffs
were
granted
any
measure
of
relief,
it
certainly
wouldn't
be
binding
upon
the
next
group
of
plaintiffs
who
wanted
to
come
in
and
assert
what
they
thought
was
the
proper
racial
mix
of
parkmerced
or
any
complex
and
it's
with
that
background,
your
honor,
that
we
proceed
to
the
question
of
standing.
we
just
do
not
feel
that
congress
ever
envisioned
that
kind
of
profound
disorder
in
creating
certain
rights
and
remedies
in
the
housing
field.
as
we
have
indicated,
now
i
think
as
both
sides
concede
the
standing
issue
in
this
case
is
not
at
all
complex,
in
fact,
it's
quite
simple.
the
length
of
the
briefs
and
the
plethora
of
cases
that
have
been
cited
on
this
subject
demonstrate
in
my
judgment
one
thing
and
that
is
the
futility
of
attempting
to
assign
to
a
statute
a
task
or
a
burden
that
it
was
never
meant
to
carry
and
i
think
that
is
the
thrust
of
the
petitioners'
position
here.
they
are
trying
to
derive
from
title
8
standing
where
none
was
ever
intended
and
the
statute
simply
won't
carry
it.
stripped
to
its
essentials,
the
issue
is
simply
this;
did
congress
intend
that
plaintiffs
such
as
this,
that
is
incumbent
tenants
have
standing
to
complain
of
the
policies
of
their
landlord
and
we
submit
that
it
clearly
did
not.
mr.
richard
j.
kilmartin
yes,
sir.
mr.
richard
j.
kilmartin
yes,
she
is
sir.
mr.
richard
j.
kilmartin
i
would
say
as
the
statute
stands
now,
yes
it
would,
but
certainly
the
dependent
relative
would
have
every
right
to
assert
his
or
her
rights
under
the
statute.
so
that
if,
in
fact,
the
discriminatory
practice
was
practiced
against
that
person,
there
would
be
a
remedy
for
it.
it
would
be
remedy
under
both
federal
and
state
laws
as
a
matter
of
fact.
california
has
a
comprehensive
public
--
fair
housing
statute
of
its
own
as
well
as
--
mr.
richard
j.
kilmartin
i
would
say,
your
honor,
that
the
statute
would
not
extend
to
that
situation,
but
once
again
i
believe
it
would
be
academic
because
of
the
fact
that
the
person
himself
or
herself
would
have
direct
rights
under
the
act
and
could
obtain
the
apartment.
mr.
richard
j.
kilmartin
that's
correct.
mr.
richard
j.
kilmartin
that's
correct,
your
honor,
or
mrs.
carr
to
take
her
dependent
relative
down
to
the
office
of
hud
to
initiate
administrative
proceedings
under
810
of
the
fair
housing
act
and
if
that
failed
and
then
that
relative
could
file
an
action
either
in
federal
or
state
court
under
section
812.
the
solicitor
general
has
eluded
to
the
fact
that
the
only
thing
involved
in
this
case
is
two
or
three
tenants
and
we
do
not
go
beyond
that,
but
the
problem
has
much
greater
dimension
than
that.
it
has
a
very
significant
effect
upon
landlords
and
it
has
a
--
as
a
practical
matter,
the
decision
of
this
court
is
going
to
go
far
beyond
if
it
grant
standing,
far
beyond
these
individual
tenants.
and
i
would
like
to
give
you
just
a
thumbnail
sketch
of
what
parkmerced
is
because
you
probably
--
maybe
some
of
you
have
seen
it,
maybe
not.
it
is
a
large
3500
apartment
complex
of
tower
buildings
and
garden
apartments
located
on
about
a
150
acres
in
the
south
west
portion
of
san
francisco.
it's
near
lake
merced.
immediately
adjacent
to
it
to
the
north
is
san
francisco
state
college
and
its
campus
which
has
in
the
neighborhood
of
20,000
students.
about
a
half
a
mile
to
the
north
of
that
is
another
complex
totally
--
apartment
complex,
totally
unrelated
to
parkmerced
called
stonestown.
immediately
to
the
south
within
a
mile
is
another
large
complex
of
apartments,
several
thousand
called
west
lake.
immediately
to
the
east
of
parkmerced
are
hundreds
of
single
family
dwellings.
we
submit
that
within
a
one
mile
radius
of
parkmerced
and
we
don't
even
have
to
go
to
arkansas,
but
there
would
be
nothing
if
this
court
granted
standing
to
these
tenants
to
prevent
the
person
in
the
house
across
the
street
from
asserting
his
views
or
the
apartment
dweller
in
the
next
complex
or
perhaps
even
the
state
college
student
who
spends
eight
hours
of
his
day,
each
day,
immediately
next
to
parkmerced.
we
submit
that
would
be
a
logical
extension
and
a
logical
consequence
of
granting
standing
to
this
type
of
plaintiff
in
this
case.
i
would
like
to
the
court
to
keep
in
mind
that
the
thrust
of
the
plaintiffs'
arguments
are
that
they
are
denied
interracial
association.
that
is
not
one
of
the
rights,
that
is
protected
by
the
statute.
they
alleged
that
their
injuries
are
social
and
professional
in
that
they
are
deprived
of
the
right
to
benefit
from
association
with
different
races,
but
the
complaints
are
silent
on
these
points.
there
is
no
allegation
in
any
complaint
that
parkmerced,
metropolitan
life
or
the
present
owner,
parkmerced
corporation
has
a
gate
at
the
door
and
blocks
any
business
or
social
visitor
to
these
plaintiffs
from
entering
his
apartment
or
coming
to
visit
him
or
from
associating
with
him
in
anyway.
the
complaint
is
devoid
of
any
such
allegations
and
the
challenge
that
they
are
denied
interracial
association
simply
fails.
the
streets
of
parkmerced
are
public,
although
the
development
is
private.
anybody
that
wants
to
come
there
can
come
at
anytime
and
visit
any
tenant
in
any
apartment
that
as
long
as
he
is,
of
course,
invited
by
the
tenant
himself.
so
there
is
absolutely
no
interference
with
free
interracial
association
nor
is
there
any
allegation
to
that
effect
in
the
complaint.
in
the
case
of
data
processing
against
camp,
mr.
justice
douglas
started
out
with
the
phrase
of
generalizations
about
standing
to
sue
are
largely
worthless
as
such.
i
believe
that
is
certainly
true
and
i
think
this
case
demonstrates
it.
however,
we
start
with
in
every
standing
case,
the
article
3
case
or
controversy
test.
the
article
3
case
or
controversy
requirement.
i
want
the
court
to
understand
clearly
here
and
now
that
what
the
petitioners'
counsel
said
and
what
the
attorney
general
implied
is
and
implies
in
their
briefs
that
is
that
these
people
have
suffered
injury,
in
fact,
and
were
therefore
automatically
over
the
hurdle
of
article
3
is
simply
not
so.
we
do
not
admit
that.
as
this
court
pointed
out
in
sierra
club
and
as
i
read
sierra
club,
the
injury
in
fact,
if
it
is
necessary,
has
to
be
in
cognizable
injury
in
fact.
it's
not
as
mr.
chief
justice
suggested
just
a
racial
slur
an
insult,
a
broken
leg
or
anything
else
but
it
has
to
be
a
cognizable
injury,
in
fact,
under
the
statutes
that
are
being
discussed
--
mr.
richard
j.
kilmartin
no,
no,
your
honor,
i
don't
suggest
that
at
all.
i
suggest
that
all
of
the
arguments
that
have
been
presented
by
the
petitioner
should
be
addressed
to
congress
if
they
want
to
grant
standing
to
people
such
as
these
and
i
would
assume
the
constitutionality
of
such
if
it
were
passed
under
this
court's
holding
in
jones
v.
mayer.
mr.
richard
j.
kilmartin
yes,
in
data
processing
and
as
well
as
other
cases,
but
data
processing
zeros
in
on
it,
as
i
understand
it,
as
i
read
it,
the
first
inquiry
is
there
a
case
or
controversy
and
to
find
that
there
is
a
case
or
controversy,
you
have
to
have
an
injury,
in
fact,
to
the
person
complaining,
that's
the
first
inquiry.
but
as
this
court
pointed
out
in
sierra
club,
it's
not
just
an
abstract
injury,
in
fact.
it
has
to
be
an
injury
cognizable
under
the
statutes
that
are
under
discussion
and
in
this
case,
those
statutes
are
title
8
and
section
1982,
now
we
submit
that
the
injuries
asserted
here,
the
injuries,
in
fact,
that
are
asserted
by
these
petitioners
are
not
the
injuries
contemplated
by
title
8
or
1982.
mr.
richard
j.
kilmartin
hud
entertained
these
complaints?
mr.
richard
j.
kilmartin
well,
yes
he
did
say
that,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
j.
kilmartin
well,
i
think
there
is
more
committed
to
hud
under
title
8
than
is
committed
to
private
plaintiffs,
your
honor.
i
think
that's
the
answer,
they
have
great
powers,
they
have
investigative
powers,
for
example.
i
think
that
hud
is
empowered
to
investigate
just
about
any
complaint
that
comes
into
its
office
and
they
have
subpoena
power.
they
don't
have
much
enforcement
power
but
they
do
have
a
lot
of
powers
to
investigate
for
the
purpose
of
recommending
to
congress.
mr.
richard
j.
kilmartin
i
think
that's
the
thrust
of
their
argument,
your
honor,
and
that's
what
i
mentioned
at
the
outset
of
my
remarks,
but
they
will
not
be
denied
the
aid
of
the
private
sector
in
my
opinion,
one
with
by
denying
standing
to
these
plaintiffs
because
as
demonstrated,
the
minute
these
plaintiffs
fail
there
is
always
the
burbridge
type
of
plaintiffs,
who
will
be
collected
and
will
file
a
suit
and
in
those
cases,
a
case
such
as
burbridge,
you
have
issues
that
are
real,
that
are
live,
not
just
abstract
contentions
such
as
the
petitioners
play
--
present
here
but
you
have
real
live
issues.
for
example,
in
the
burbridge
case,
the
complaints
of
discrimination
are
subject
to
rectification.
they
can
sit
down,
these
tenants
can
sit
down
with
the
landlord
and
they
can
talk
across
the
table
and
as
was
the
case
in
this
situation,
they
were
all
offered
apartments.
mr.
richard
j.
kilmartin
by
these
plaintiffs,
you
are
referring
to
the
trafficante,
your
honor?
mr.
richard
j.
kilmartin
i
would
say,
no,
butt
their
redress
would
be
to
go
and
collect
the
plaintiffs
who
have
been
discriminated
against
and
let
them
file
an
action
on
their
own,
in
their
own
name.
mr.
richard
j.
kilmartin
that's
correct,
that's
correct.
we
believe,
your
honor,
to
achieve
that
result,
you
would
have
to
have
a
standing
statute
far
beyond
what
we
have
in
this
case.
we
think
1982
is
clear
on
its
face
and
i
believe
that
this
court
in
its
decision
in
sierra
club
posited
the
meaning
of
that
section
quite
clearly
when
it
said
hurd
versus
hodge,
it's
an
earlier
decision
of
the
court,
squarely
held
therefore
that
a
negro
citizen
who
is
denied
the
opportunity
to
purchase
the
home
he
wants
solely
because
of
his
race
and
color,
has
suffered
the
kind
of
injury
that
1982
was
designed
to
prevent.
that
is
the
person
directly
affected
and
not
the
person
who
was
on
the
other
side
of
the
legal
coin
so
to
speak
attempting
to
assert
the
rights
of
somebody
else
and
in
title
8,
i
believe
it
is
even
clearer
because
when
you
track
the
sections
of
title
8
and
correlate
them,
it
seems
to
be
crystal
clear
that
the
only
ones
and
as
held
by
the
ninth
circuit
and
the
district
court,
the
only
ones
who
were
the
intended
beneficiaries
of
that
act
work
the
persons
who
were
directly
discriminated
against
and
i
refer
the
court
specifically
to
those
portions
of
the
act,
3610,
3602
f
and
3604
and
3612.
mr.
richard
j.
kilmartin
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
j.
kilmartin
well,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
j.
kilmartin
yes,
i
think
so
to
put
it
in
proper
context,
we
would
have
to
know
exactly
what
hud
did
with
such
complaints
and
what
they
intended
to
do
with
them
or
what
they
are
trying
to
do.
their
conciliations
and
persuasion
powers
are
virtually
unlimited
in
that
sense.
mr.
richard
j.
kilmartin
well,
i
--
that's
(voice
overlap)
mr.
richard
j.
kilmartin
that's
right,
but
i
think
that
hud
could
accept
--
to
illustrate
by
exaggeration,
hud
could
accept
it
in
informative
context.
mr.
richard
j.
kilmartin
that
is
correct,
i
suggest
that
also.
and
i
would
like
to
draw
the
court's
attention
to
the
specific
provisions
of
3610
and
3612
which
when
authorizing
suit
state
that
the
suit
maybe
filed
to
enforce
the
rights
granted
or
protected
by
this
sub
chapter.
in
3612,
the
rights
granted
by
sections
3604
maybe
enforced
by
civil
actions,
the
rights
granted
not
just
any
old
right,
but
the
rights
granted
by
3604.
the
rights
granted
by
3604
which
were
at
issue
in
this
case
are
(a)
the
right
to
rent
an
apartment
without
being
discriminated
against
because
of
race,
(b)
the
right
to
have
a
landlord,
not
make
a
misrepresentation
to
you
that
the
apartment
is
or
is
not
available
and
three
the
right
to
rent
the
apartment
on
the
same
basis
as
anybody
else
and
receive
the
same
services.
those
are
the
rights
that
this
act
creates,
those
are
the
rights
that
this
act
protects,.
those
are
the
rights
that
are
not
involved
in
this
action.
thank
you,
your
honor.
