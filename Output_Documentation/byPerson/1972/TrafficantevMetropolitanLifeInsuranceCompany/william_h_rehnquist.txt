justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
bomse,
in
a
statutory
piece
like
this,
how
much
help
do
you
think
you
can
get
from
related
adjudication
as
to
standing
under
other
statutes
or
perhaps
on
constitutional
question.
it
pretty
much
boils
down
to
what
congress
meant
in
this
particular
statute?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
we
would
have
great
trouble,
wouldn't
we,
in
trying
to
decide
this
case
and
say
it
does
include
a
tenant
that
parkmerced
under
the
standing
clause
and
try
to
give
some
principle
reason
for
it
without
saying
that
it
either
does
or
does
not
include
the
man
three
blocks
away?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
isn't
that
the
congress
couldn't
have
conferred
standing
here,
had
it
desired
to
do
so?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
then
would
you
state
again
just
very
briefly,
summarize
your
case
or
controversy
argument,
i
don't
believe
i
fully
apprehended
what
you
meant
by
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
supposing
mr.
kilmartin
that
the
burbridge
plaintiffs
sue
to
enjoin
unlawful
discrimination
under
the
act
and
it
turns
out
that,
in
fact,
there
was
no
unlawful
discrimination
against
them
and
yet
these
plaintiffs
know
of
another
refusal
on
the
part
of
parkmerced
which
was
an
unlawful
discrimination.
now,
presumably
these
plaintiffs
could
redress
that
unlawful
discrimination
whereas
the
burbridge
plaintiffs
couldn't,
am
i
not
right
in
that?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
right.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
i
mean
if
this
type
of
lawsuit
were
allowed
some
actual
incidence
of
discrimination
would
be
redressed
that
might
not
be
picked
up
in
a
burbridge
type
suit
because
not
every
guy
who
is
discriminated
against
is
necessarily
going
to
sue?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
how
do
you
get
those
in
the
record
if
the
case
was
dismissed
on
the
basis
of
insufficiency
of
the
complaint?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
the
trial
court
virtually
treated
this
as
a
motion
for
summary
judgment?
