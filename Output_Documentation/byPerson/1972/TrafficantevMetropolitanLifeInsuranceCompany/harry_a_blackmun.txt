justice
harry
a.
blackmun
would
you
suggest
them
that
persons
living
in
north-west
arkansas,
where
there
is
present
on
only
one
race
are
suffering
deprivations
of
the
kind
you
are
suggesting?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
i
read
your
doctor
expert’s
affidavit
and
it
seemed
to
me
it
would
be
applicable
to
the
eskimo
who
lives
only
among
eskimos
or
someone
living
in
the
heart
of
africa
living
only
among
blacks?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
now
that
i
have
already
interrupted
you,
there
is
a
companion
cases
that
are
not
involved
in
those
who
allegedly
were
denied
entrance
to
parkmerced?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
what
is
the
status
of
that
case?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
they
were
not
instituted
simultaneously?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
mr.
wallace,
if
the
court
were
to
grant
to
these
plaintiffs
standing,
plaintiffs
who
are
deprived
of
the
right
to
live
in
an
integrated
community
as
i
understand
their
language
here,
how
can
we
define
community
in
a
way
that
will
play
some
limits
on
the
concept
of
standing?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
mr.
wallace,
you
have
used
the
words
'particular
complex.'
if
standing
were
applicable
to
the
particular
complex,
is
it
also
applicable
to
complex
across
the
street?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
yes,
but
these
plaintiffs
have
standing
to
complain
about
the
complex
across
the
street?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
you
can
see,
i
am
troubled
as
to
the
limitations
of
this.
that
would
be
the
next
case
from
--
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
mr.
kilmartin.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
let
me
put
this
hypothetical
to
you,
it's
mrs.
carr
here,
who
is
a
member
of
the
minority
race,
isn't
she?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
suppose
that
there
were
some
vacant
apartments
and
she
had
a
dependent
relative
who
she
would
like
to
have
come
in
to
the
complex
and
the
admission
of
that
relative
was
refused.
would
this
be
beyond
her
rights
under
the
statute?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
(inaudible)
that
mrs.
carr
even
though
these
were
her
dependent
and
she
could
show
it
to
be
much
more
convenient,
less
expensive
to
have
her
at
hand
rather
than
across
town?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
mr.
shea
at
that
point,
there
is
something
in
the
record,
perhaps
in
the
pleadings
that
in
1970
of
some
6,600
people
in
the
complex,
one-half
or
1%
were
non-white.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
does
the
record
show
whether
the
situation
is
the
same
today?
i
suppose
that
it
doesn't
show
that,
does
it?
