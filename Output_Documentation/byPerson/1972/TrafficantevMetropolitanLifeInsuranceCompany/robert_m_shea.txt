mr.
robert
m.
shea
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
my
primary
concern
this
afternoon
will
be
to
discuss
the
question
of
the
liability
of
parkmerced
corporation
as
a
successor
in
ownership
of
the
parkmerced
apartment
complex
to
metropolitan.
however,
i
would
initially
like
to
make
a
remark
concerning
standing.of
course,
it
is
clear
and
i
don't
believe,
it
has
been
specifically
had
adverted
to
as
yet
that
if
this
case
goes
forward
at
the
behest
of
these
petitioners,
the
very
person
who
is
discriminated
against
themselves
will
not
be
bound
or
affected.
so,
presumably
under
a
statute
which
has
a
relatively
short
statute
of
limitations
and
which
is
cast
in
terms
of
specific
discriminatory
housing
practices,
in
order
to
prevail
these
plaintiffs,
although
their
complaint
contains
no
specific
allegation
of
a
specific
wrongful
conduct,
will
have
to
prove
that
mr.
a
came
to
the
premises,
made
an
application
and
was
wrongfully
excluded
and
b
and
c,
none
of
those
people
is
present.
moreover,
may
i
point
out
to
the
court
that
under
section
3604
of
the
statute
in
describing
a
violation
and
refusal
to
rent,
the
statute
specifically
requires
a
finding
as
to
the
bona
fide,
the
good
faith
of
the
applicant
for
an
apartment.
well,
it
seems
particularly
inappropriate
that
plaintiffs
who
are
not
themselves
in
the
excluded
group
should
be
permitted
or
even
called
upon
to
litigate
the
good
faith
of
those
not
represented
nor
bound
by
the
action.
indeed,
the
decision
to
that
extent
lack
finality.
there
was
a
question
from
the
court
--
mr.
robert
m.
shea
yes,
sir.mr.
chief
justice,
the
ability
to
sue
in
respect
of
a
pattern
or
practice
of
discrimination
is
rested
--
mr.
robert
m.
shea
indeed,
and
i
am
paraphrasing
the
statutory
language,
if
he
reasonably
believes
that
there
has
been
a
pattern
or
practice
of
resistance
to
the
full
enjoyment
of
rights.
now,
a
private
plaintiff
who
phrased
a
compliant
in
precisely
those
terms
would
necessarily
not
be
entitled
to
proceed.
the
private
action
rights
and
remedies
under
the
statute
are
limited
to
those
brought
within
180
days
of
the
specific
discriminatory
housing
practice
complaint
off
and
otherwise,
limited.
we
do
not
contend
as
our
brief
makes
clear
that
an
appropriate
private
plaintiff
who
complies
with
the
requirements
of
rule
23
of
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure,
may
not
maintain
a
class
action
and
represent
broad
and
obtain
broad
relief,
but
that's
not
this
case.
there
was
a
question
from
the
bench
as
to
the
power
of
congress
to
enact
legislation
which
might
provide
plaintiffs
in
petitioners'
position
of
standing.
i
believe
that
there
is
no
question
that
could
be
done
and
would
call
the
court's
attention
to
the
provisions
of
the
1964
public
accommodations
civil
rights
act
which
in
its
terms
provides
that
citizens
are
entitled
to
public
accommodations
which
are
free
of
segregation
and
discrimination.
there
is
no
question
that
a
plaintiff,
any
citizen
who
encounters
a
condition
of
segregation
or
discrimination
can
sue
under
that
act.
i
might
note
that
the
act
also
limits
the
remedy
to
injunctive
relief
without
damages.
now,
in
the
1968
civil
rights
act
here
at
issue,
there
is
no
comfortable
language
and
the
remedy
is
afforded
to
the
private
plaintiff
include
damages,
penalty
damages
as
well
as
the
right
to
recover
attorney's
fees
in
appropriate
instances.
turning
to
the
main
thrust
of
my
talk
today,
parkmerced
corporation
purchased
the
properties
after,
some
months
after
the
complaints
at
issue
here
were
filed.
parkmerced
corporation
is
a
special
purpose
corporation
created
for
purposes
of
acquiring
the
property.
it
had
no
connection
with
the
alleged
acts
of
housing
discrimination
attributed
to
metropolitan
and
it
was
joined
after
the
suit
was
commenced
under
federal
rule
25
as
a
party
defendant.
mr.
robert
m.
shea
i
have
no
reason
to
question
that
statistic,
sir.
mr.
robert
m.
shea
there
is
no
record
other
than
the
complaint
and
ancillary
papers,
your
honor.
i
can
assure
the
court
that
while
there
may
have
been
some
changes,
i
do
not
think
the
court
is
justified
in
assuming
there
is
a
materially
different
complex
of
tenants
within
parkmerced.
now
as
to
the
success
and
interest
of
the
position,
i
should
point
out
that
under
familiar
concepts
of
law,
ordinarily,
a
private
entity
is
not
liable
for
the
conduct
of
another
unless
it
somehow
has
contributed
to,
conspired
in
or
otherwise
become
involved
in
the
conduct
itself
which
is
a
violation.
none
of
these
factors
applies
to
the
case
of
parkmerced
corporation.
as
to
the
pleadings
in
the
case,
the
pleadings
simply
assert
that
parkmerced
corporation
had
notice
of
the
charges
at
the
time
it
bought
and
secondly,
upon
information
and
belief
that
parkmerced
corporation
in
the
two
weeks
which
has
elapsed
from
december
21,
1970
when
it
purchased
the
property
and
january
5,
1971
when
an
amended
complaint
stating
a
cause
of
action
against
parkmerced
corporation
was
filed,
in
that
two-week
period,
that
they
have
not
made
substantial
changes
in
the
operations
of
parkmerced.
thirdly,
upon
information
and
belief
the
assertion
is
made
that
parkmerced
intends
to
continue
the
employees
and
their
real
estate
office
and
not
to
make
changes
in
policies.
now
the
later
allegations
incidentally
are
by
--
in
terms
of
the
complaint
itself
based
upon
public
information,
typed
letters
sent
to
tenants
advising
them
of
the
transfer
which
in
effect
said,
“we've
been
happy
to
have
you
and
we
will
continue
with
operations
as
before.”
in
their
briefs,
the
petitioners
attempt
to
maintain
the
position
that
metropolitan
and
parkmerced
corporation,
notwithstanding
the
complete
separation
of
interest
between
them
which
we
have
made
explicit
in
our
briefs,
are
somehow
involved
in
a
joint
venture.
this
is
wholly
inaccurate.
first
of
all
metropolitan
provided
mortgage
financing
and
has
committed
to
provide
additional
mortgage
financing.
these
obligations
are
represented
in
a
mortgage
in
a
side
letter
agreement.
indeed
the
letter
agreement
itself
is
so
detailed
as
to
belie
any
suggestion
that
the
lender,
metropolitan
was
in
anyway
involved
in
the
future
operating
decisions
which
would
result
in
mortgage
liability,
additional
lending
by
it.
finally,
there
is
an
assertion
that
metropolitan
has
--
in
the
petitioners'
brief
that
metropolitan
has
retained
the
power
to
appoint
a
property
manager.
this
is
simply
not
correct,
metropolitan
as
a
mortgage
lender
and
as
lessor
under
the
ground
lease
which
is
here
at
issue,
has
the
power
for
cause
only
to
require
that
parkmerced
give
up
the
management
of
the
premises
and
in
such
case,
upon
indeed
a
failure
of
parkmerced
property
to
manage
the
premises.
parkmerced
would
select
from
a
list
provided
by
metropolitan,
the
new
manager.
it
simply
is
not
a
reservation
of
control
in
metropolitan.
mr.
robert
m.
shea
sir,
the
essential
question
before
the
court
is
the
adequacy
of
the
pleadings
as
against
parkmerced.
now,
of
course,
this
court
will
not
reach
the
issue
of
the
successor's
liability
if
it
decides
the
standing
issue
in
our
favor.
mr.
robert
m.
shea
i
beg
your
pardon,
sir?
mr.
robert
m.
shea
you
have
the
complaint
and
also
--
mr.
robert
m.
shea
sir
the
--
your
honor,
the
question
--
mr.
robert
m.
shea
yes,
indeed.
mr.
robert
m.
shea
the
amended
complaint
against
parkmerced
corporation
filed
at
the
time
we
were
joined
as
plaintiffs
contains
allegations.
mr.
robert
m.
shea
they
are
accepted
as
true.
however,
they
are
substantially
alleviate
in
light
of
the
facts,
otherwise
appearing
in
record
i
think
is
appropriately
measured
by
this
court.
the
documents
comprising
the
relationship,
the
financial
lease
and
the
other
documents
comprising
the
relationship
have
been
submitted
in
the
record
of
this
case
which
has
been
transmitted
to
this
court.
mr.
robert
m.
shea
your
honor,
the
petitioners
themselves
secured
the
documents
and
they
were
submitted
to
the
trial
court
as
pertinent
to
the
motion
for
a
judgment
to
dismiss
the
case
on
the
grounds
of
lack
of
standing.
mr.
robert
m.
shea
it
could
be
so
regarded.
it
wasn't
adverted
to
as
a
problem
by
the
trial
court
and
has
been
treated
as
if
dismissal
was
solely
upon
the
pleadings.
however,
as
you
will
note
in
the
briefs
of
the
parties,
a
liberal
reference
has
been
made
to
these
documents
of
lease
and
contract.
in
compressing
the
remaining
parts
of
my
argument,
i
would
like
to
point
out
to
the
court
that
again
practicality
is
must
to
govern.
if
tenants
in
this
position
are
permitted
to
maintain
a
suit
containing
general
allegations
and
then
in
the
face
of
the
general
allegations
without
specific
reference
to
any
facts,
require
that
a
successor
unconnected
with
the
wrongs
be
compelled
to
litigate
and
subjected
to
the
possible
prospect
of
affirmative
relief,
you
have
provided
the
tenant
group,
be
they
in
good
faith
or
bad,
with
a
tremendous
weapon
to
use
to
impair
transfers
of
property
and
to
impose
their
will
and
their
conditions
upon
the
successor
purchaser,
who
i
remind
the
court
has
done
absolutely
no
wrong.
he
simply
has
notice
of
charges
which
the
predecessor
owner
denies
and
there
are
no
specific
allegations
at
issue
and
there
is
nothing
he
can
investigate
and
determine.
the
mediation
consolidation
process
is
frustrated
by
suits
of
this
generality.
mr.
robert
m.
shea
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
my
primary
concern
this
afternoon
will
be
to
discuss
the
question
of
the
liability
of
parkmerced
corporation
as
a
successor
in
ownership
of
the
parkmerced
apartment
complex
to
metropolitan.
however,
i
would
initially
like
to
make
a
remark
concerning
standing.of
course,
it
is
clear
and
i
don't
believe,
it
has
been
specifically
had
adverted
to
as
yet
that
if
this
case
goes
forward
at
the
behest
of
these
petitioners,
the
very
person
who
is
discriminated
against
themselves
will
not
be
bound
or
affected.
so,
presumably
under
a
statute
which
has
a
relatively
short
statute
of
limitations
and
which
is
cast
in
terms
of
specific
discriminatory
housing
practices,
in
order
to
prevail
these
plaintiffs,
although
their
complaint
contains
no
specific
allegation
of
a
specific
wrongful
conduct,
will
have
to
prove
that
mr.
a
came
to
the
premises,
made
an
application
and
was
wrongfully
excluded
and
b
and
c,
none
of
those
people
is
present.
moreover,
may
i
point
out
to
the
court
that
under
section
3604
of
the
statute
in
describing
a
violation
and
refusal
to
rent,
the
statute
specifically
requires
a
finding
as
to
the
bona
fide,
the
good
faith
of
the
applicant
for
an
apartment.
well,
it
seems
particularly
inappropriate
that
plaintiffs
who
are
not
themselves
in
the
excluded
group
should
be
permitted
or
even
called
upon
to
litigate
the
good
faith
of
those
not
represented
nor
bound
by
the
action.
indeed,
the
decision
to
that
extent
lack
finality.
there
was
a
question
from
the
court
--
mr.
robert
m.
shea
yes,
sir.mr.
chief
justice,
the
ability
to
sue
in
respect
of
a
pattern
or
practice
of
discrimination
is
rested
--
mr.
robert
m.
shea
indeed,
and
i
am
paraphrasing
the
statutory
language,
if
he
reasonably
believes
that
there
has
been
a
pattern
or
practice
of
resistance
to
the
full
enjoyment
of
rights.
now,
a
private
plaintiff
who
phrased
a
compliant
in
precisely
those
terms
would
necessarily
not
be
entitled
to
proceed.
the
private
action
rights
and
remedies
under
the
statute
are
limited
to
those
brought
within
180
days
of
the
specific
discriminatory
housing
practice
complaint
off
and
otherwise,
limited.
we
do
not
contend
as
our
brief
makes
clear
that
an
appropriate
private
plaintiff
who
complies
with
the
requirements
of
rule
23
of
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure,
may
not
maintain
a
class
action
and
represent
broad
and
obtain
broad
relief,
but
that's
not
this
case.
there
was
a
question
from
the
bench
as
to
the
power
of
congress
to
enact
legislation
which
might
provide
plaintiffs
in
petitioners'
position
of
standing.
i
believe
that
there
is
no
question
that
could
be
done
and
would
call
the
court's
attention
to
the
provisions
of
the
1964
public
accommodations
civil
rights
act
which
in
its
terms
provides
that
citizens
are
entitled
to
public
accommodations
which
are
free
of
segregation
and
discrimination.
there
is
no
question
that
a
plaintiff,
any
citizen
who
encounters
a
condition
of
segregation
or
discrimination
can
sue
under
that
act.
i
might
note
that
the
act
also
limits
the
remedy
to
injunctive
relief
without
damages.
now,
in
the
1968
civil
rights
act
here
at
issue,
there
is
no
comfortable
language
and
the
remedy
is
afforded
to
the
private
plaintiff
include
damages,
penalty
damages
as
well
as
the
right
to
recover
attorney's
fees
in
appropriate
instances.
turning
to
the
main
thrust
of
my
talk
today,
parkmerced
corporation
purchased
the
properties
after,
some
months
after
the
complaints
at
issue
here
were
filed.
parkmerced
corporation
is
a
special
purpose
corporation
created
for
purposes
of
acquiring
the
property.
it
had
no
connection
with
the
alleged
acts
of
housing
discrimination
attributed
to
metropolitan
and
it
was
joined
after
the
suit
was
commenced
under
federal
rule
25
as
a
party
defendant.
mr.
robert
m.
shea
i
have
no
reason
to
question
that
statistic,
sir.
mr.
robert
m.
shea
there
is
no
record
other
than
the
complaint
and
ancillary
papers,
your
honor.
i
can
assure
the
court
that
while
there
may
have
been
some
changes,
i
do
not
think
the
court
is
justified
in
assuming
there
is
a
materially
different
complex
of
tenants
within
parkmerced.
now
as
to
the
success
and
interest
of
the
position,
i
should
point
out
that
under
familiar
concepts
of
law,
ordinarily,
a
private

is
not
liable
for
the
conduct
of
another
unless
it
somehow
has
contributed
to,
conspired
in
or
otherwise
become
involved
in
the
conduct
itself
which
is
a
violation.
none
of
these
factors
applies
to
the
case
of
parkmerced
corporation.
as
to
the
pleadings
in
the
case,
the
pleadings
simply
assert
that
parkmerced
corporation
had
notice
of
the
charges
at
the
time
it
bought
and
secondly,
upon
information
and
belief
that
parkmerced
corporation
in
the
two
weeks
which
has
elapsed
from
december
21,
1970
when
it
purchased
the
property
and
january
5,
1971
when
an
amended
complaint
stating
a
cause
of
action
against
parkmerced
corporation
was
filed,
in
that
two-week
period,
that
they
have
not
made
substantial
changes
in
the
operations
of
parkmerced.
thirdly,
upon
information
and
belief
the
assertion
is
made
that
parkmerced
intends
to
continue
the
employees
and
their
real
estate
office
and
not
to
make
changes
in
policies.
now
the
later
allegations
incidentally
are
by
--
in
terms
of
the
complaint
itself
based
upon
public
information,
typed
letters
sent
to

the
transfer
which
in
effect
said,
“we've
been
happy
to
have
you
and
we
will
continue
with
operations
as
before.”
in
their
briefs,
the
petitioners
attempt
to
maintain
the
position
that
metropolitan
and
parkmerced
corporation,
notwithstanding
the
complete
separation
of
interest
between
them
which
we
have
made
explicit
in
our
briefs,
are
somehow
involved
in
a
joint
venture.
this
is
wholly
inaccurate.
first
of
all
metropolitan
provided
mortgage
financing
and
has
committed
to
provide
additional
mortgage
financing.
these
obligations
are
represented
in
a
mortgage
in
a
side
letter
agreement.
indeed
the
letter
agreement
itself
is
so
detailed
as
to
belie
any
suggestion
that
the
lender,
metropolitan
was
in
anyway
involved
in
the
future
operating
decisions
which
would
result
in
mortgage
liability,
additional
lending
by
it.
finally,
there
is
an
assertion
that
metropolitan
has
--
in
the
petitioners'
brief
that
metropolitan
has
retained
the
power
to
appoint
a
property
manager.
this
is
simply
not
correct,
metropolitan
as
a
mortgage
lender
and
as
lessor
under
the
ground
lease
which
is
here
at
issue,
has
the
power
for
cause
only
to
require
that
parkmerced
give
up
the
management
of
the
premises
and
in
such
case,
upon
indeed
a
failure
of
parkmerced
property
to
manage
the
premises.
parkmerced
would
select
from
a
list
provided
by
metropolitan,
the
new
manager.
it
simply
is
not
a
reservation
of
control
in
metropolitan.
mr.
robert
m.
shea
sir,
the
essential
question
before
the
court
is
the
adequacy
of
the
pleadings
as
against
parkmerced.
now,
of
course,
this
court
will
not
reach
the
issue
of
the
successor's
liability
if
it
decides
the
standing
issue
in
our
favor.
mr.
robert
m.
shea
i
beg
your
pardon,
sir?
mr.
robert
m.
shea
you
have
the
complaint
and
also
--
mr.
robert
m.
shea
sir
the
--
your
honor,
the
question
--
mr.
robert
m.
shea
yes,
indeed.
mr.
robert
m.
shea
the
amended
complaint
against
parkmerced
corporation
filed
at
the
time
we
were
joined
as
plaintiffs
contains
allegations.
mr.
robert
m.
shea
they
are
accepted
as
true.
however,
they
are
substantially
alleviate
in
light
of
the
facts,
otherwise
appearing
in
record
i
think
is
appropriately
measured
by
this
court.
the
documents
comprising
the
relationship,
the
financial
lease
and
the
other
documents
comprising
the
relationship
have
been
submitted
in
the
record
of
this
case
which
has
been
transmitted
to
this
court.
mr.
robert
m.
shea
your
honor,
the
petitioners
themselves
secured
the
documents
and
they
were
submitted
to
the
trial
court
as
pertinent
to
the
motion
for
a
judgment
to
dismiss
the
case
on
the
grounds
of
lack
of
standing.
mr.
robert
m.
shea
it
could
be
so
regarded.
it
wasn't
adverted
to
as
a
problem
by
the
trial
court
and
has
been
treated
as
if
dismissal
was
solely
upon
the
pleadings.
however,
as
you
will
note
in
the
briefs
of
the
parties,
a
liberal
reference
has
been
made
to
these
documents
of
lease
and
contract.
in
compressing
the
remaining
parts
of
my
argument,
i
would
like
to
point
out
to
the
court
that
again
practicality
is
must
to
govern.
if
tenants
in
this
position
are
permitted
to
maintain
a
suit
containing
general
allegations
and
then
in
the
face
of
the
general
allegations
without
specific
reference
to
any
facts,
require
that
a
successor
unconnected
with
the
wrongs
be
compelled
to
litigate
and
subjected
to
the
possible
prospect
of
affirmative
relief,
you
have
provided
the
tenant
group,
be
they
in
good
faith
or
bad,
with
a
tremendous
weapon
to
use
to
impair
transfers
of
property
and
to
impose
their
will
and
their
conditions
upon
the
successor
purchaser,
who
i
remind
the
court
has
done
absolutely
no
wrong.
he
simply
has
notice
of
charges
which
the
predecessor
owner
denies
and
there
are
no
specific
allegations
at
issue
and
there
is
nothing
he
can
investigate
and
determine.
the
mediation
consolidation
process
is
frustrated
by
suits
of
this
generality.
