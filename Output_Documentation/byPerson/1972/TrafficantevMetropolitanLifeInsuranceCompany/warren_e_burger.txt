chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we'll
hear
arguments
next
in
number
71-708,
trafficante
against
metropolitan
life
and
others.
mr.
bomse,
you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
isn't
that
something
that
must
be
read
with
the
other
section,
provision
of
the
statute
that
thrust
of
the
statutory
scheme
is
to
see
that
all
citizens
will
have
the
same
right
to
inherit
purchase,
lease,
sell,
hold,
convey
property.
now
under
which
part
of
that
statute
do
you
say
the
petitioners
here
fall?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
right.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
are
speaking
now
of
the
petitioners
who
seek
standing.
under
which
part
of
that
particular
statute
do
you
say
they
come,
i.e,
are
they
being
--
the
petitioners,
not
someone
else,
are
the
petitioners
being
denied
the
right
to
inherit,
purchase,
lease,
sell,
hold,
or
convey?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that's
the
question,
isn't
it,
whether
they
suffered
the
kind
of
injury
that's
contemplated
to
give
before
them
standing?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
you
say,
that
doesn't
--
certainly
the
statute
must
mean
something
more
than
having
a
feeling,
something
of
substance,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
now
those
might
be
good
reasons
to
urge
upon
congress
for
specifically
granting
them
standing,
but
do
you
suggest
that
the
utterances
of
some
of
the
prime
authors
support
that
view?
didn't
senator
mondale
himself
indicate
that
as
an
illustration,
in
response
to
a
question
that
what
the
statute
was
about,
was
that
when
a
man
wants
to
buy
a
particular
piece
of
property
or
lease
it,
this
statute
is
to
help
him
get
it
and
--
him.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
it
didn't
senator
hart's
language
address
itself
directly
to
this
point
when
he
said
that
as
these
provisions
now
on
stand,
they
reveal
a
congressional
intent,
a
clear
congressional
intent
to
permit
and
even
encourage
litigation
by
those
who
cannot
afford
to
redress
specific
wrong
done
to
them
because
of
the
color
of
their
skin.
doesn't
that
indicate
that
at
least
at
that
point,
he
was
talking
about
standing
and
said
it's
limited
to
the
people
who
are
themselves
wronged
by
exclusion?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now
this
related
litigation
that
you
mentioned
in
response
to
a
question,
will
that
litigation
--
is
that
litigation
such
in
its
scope
that
all
of
the
relief
sought
here
could
be
accomplished
there?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
wallace.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
could
it,
to
pursue
them
mr.
wallace,
would
they
have
--
would
it
be
necessary
that
they
be
even
residents
of
the
same
state,
let
alone
the
same
city,
if
they
claim
the
injury?
we're
talking
about
standing
now
and
not
of
talking
about
evidentiary?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
wallace.
mr.
kilmartin.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
there
any
question
with
they
have
standing?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
if
mrs.
carr
in
that
illustration
was
so
disposed,
again
coming
down
to
the
practical
matter
as
you
spoke
up
earlier,
all
would
need
to
be
done
to
assure
a
standing
would
be
to
join
the
dependent
relatives
as
plaintiffs,
isn't
that
so?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
then
there
being
one
plaintiff
withstanding,
there
probably
wouldn't
be
too
much
profit
in
people
challenging,
standing
of
other
plaintiffs?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
for
administrative
relief.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
one
of
their
complaints
is
i
got
it
is
that
congress
has
not
supplied
hud
and
the
other
establishments
with
enough
manpower
to
do
the
job
and
that's
why
they
want
the
aid
of
private
attorneys
general,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
shea.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
are
you
saying,
let
me
interrupt
you
there.
are
you
saying
that
these
plaintiffs
would
not
make
out
a
case
if
they
established
a
general
pattern,
they
must
prove
specific
cases?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
affirmative
to
the
attorney
general,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
gentleman.
the
case
is
submitted.
