didn't
i
understand
mr.
wallace
to
suggest
that
the
hud
entertains
that
--
complaints
of
this
kind
of
entry,
under
this
statute,
am
i
wrong
about
that?

hud
entertains
complaints
of
this
kind,
didn't
he
tell
us
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
at
least
--
that
agency
at
least
thinks
that
this
kind
of
complaint
of
injury
is
an
injury?
justice
william
j.
brennan,

may
i
ask
you
something?
i
notice
that
810
(a)
which
is
the
language
we're

about
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
is
talking
about
a
person
who
could
make
to
what,
who
may
do
what,
who
may
file
a
complaint
with
the
secretary
and
it's
only
in
the
event
that
the
secretary
is
unable
to
do
anything
about
it
that
then
that
person
may
commence
a
civil
action.
well,
it
does
seem
to
me
that
we
have
got
an
administrative
interpretation
if
i
correctly
understand
mr.
wallace,
on
the
part
of
hud
that
the
very
people
who
we're
talking
about
here,
who
are
plaintiffs
qualify
to
file
complaints
to
the
secretary.
justice
william
j.
brennan,

and
if
they
are,
then
it
[attempt
to
laughter]
seems
logically
the
statute
means
that
they
also
have
standing
to
bring
suit
when
those
things
happen
and
the
secretary
has
been
able
to
attend
involuntary
compliance
and
so
forth.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
that
might
be,
but
if
you
are
right,
if
you
are
and
the
court
of
appeals
below
was
right.
it
would
seem
to
me
hud
ought
to
refuse
to
accept
complaints
under
(a)
tenants
like
these
petitioners?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
am
i
not
right,
that
is
what
(a)
talks
about
filing
complaints,
isn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
maybe
they
could
but
they
wouldn't
have
to
if
the
court

is
right,
i
suggest?
