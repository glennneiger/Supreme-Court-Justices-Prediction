justice
potter
stewart
now
we
don't
at
least
in
theory
in
this
case,
we
don't
need
to
decide
anything
more
than
what
you
have
just
argued,
do
we,
in
order
to
decide
in
your
favor
that
until
or
in
last
the
west
case
is
overruled,
it's
to
be
considered
law.
without
expressing
any
view
on
whether
or
not
to
--
without
either
over
overruling
or
affirming
it,
isn't
that
correct?
that's
really
all
it
represents,
that's
what
your
argument
is.
not
that
the
west
case
is
--
should
be
overruled
or
should
not
be
overruled.
that's
simply
that
until
it’s
overruled,
it's
the
law
that
has
to
be
followed,
and
the
court
of
claims
was
wrong
in
doing
so.
justice
potter
stewart
at
least,
in
theory,
we
wouldn’t
--
don’t
need
to
say
anything
more
in
order
to
decide
in
your
favor,
in
this
case.
we
wouldn't
have
to
say
whether
or
not
the
west
case
should
be
overruled
or
is
going
to
be
overruled,
and
certainly
we
wouldn't
have
to
over
--
wer
wouldn't
have
to
reaffirm
it,
in
order
to
decide
in
your
favor.
justice
potter
stewart
now
you
erode
it
and
undermined
that
whatever,
but
nobody
claims
that
it's
been
expressively
overruled.
justice
potter
stewart
it's
not
a
fortiori
case
in
which
direction?
you
said
earlier
that
it
would
be
very
difficult
and
extremely
anomalous
to
hold
that
state
taxes
didn't
apply
if
federal
taxes
did?
justice
potter
stewart
but
does
it
work
the
same
way
in
the
opposite
direction?
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
it's
nit
a
fortiori
tax
--
justice
potter
stewart
but
it's
certainly
not
a
fortiori?
justice
potter
stewart
some
can
be
a
fortiori
in
both
directions
by
definition?
justice
potter
stewart
wasn't
part
of
the
–
at
least
part
of
the
rationale
of
capoeman
be
proposition
that
it
could
hardly
be
presumed
that
the
guardian
would
tax
the
ward
and
that
there
was
emphasis
in
part's
of
the
opinion
upon
that
relationship
and
that
relationship
simply
doesn't
exist
in
this
case?
justice
potter
stewart
nor
in
west,
no
--
the
oklahoma
is
not
the
guardian
of
these
indians?
justice
potter
stewart
exactly
and
that
was
united
states
tax
in
capoeman?
justice
potter
stewart
well
and
that
is
your
view,
that
is
the
way
you
read
it,
but
concededly
there
was
language
in
capoeman
opinion
along
the
lines
i
have
indicated,
was
there
not,
that
it
is
hardly
to
be
presumed
that
the
guardian
would
tax
the
ward
for
the
guardian's
benefit.
and
also
there
is
a
language
in
the
capoeman
opinion,
as
i
remember
that
said
that
the,
guardian
as
guardian
united
states
as
the
guardian
was
the
one
who
determined
when
then
how
the
timber
would
be
cut
and
therefore
was
in
a
conflict
of
interest
as
a
tax
collector?
justice
potter
stewart
to
maximize
or
the
income
or
whatever?
justice
potter
stewart
yes
but
this
is
an
oklahoma
tax
return?
justice
potter
stewart
that
is
what
i
was
--
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
so
this
property
here
is
not
timber,
it
is
a
mineral
property
permit,
is
it
not?
not
oil
and
gas
and
you
say
that
each
had
now
has
about
an
income
of
something
over
$3000
a
year?
justice
potter
stewart
it
used
to
be
astronomically
high,
did
it
not?
justice
potter
stewart
up
in
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
are
the
reason
of
depletion
--
justice
potter
stewart
was
it
oil
or
gas
or
both?
justice
potter
stewart
yeah,
and
this
–
the
decedent
was
lived
on
reservation,
where
the
reservation
indian
--
justice
potter
stewart
but
it
is
not
in
the
record,
you
can
hardly
–
anyway
if
it
is
not
the
racket
it
means
that
you
have
not
relied
on
it
up
till
now?
