mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
may
it
please
the
court.
in
the
present
fluid
state
of
our
law,
court
spend
a
good
deal
of
time
going
over
all
ground,
that
is
the
situation
in
this
case.
the
case
is
here
on
certiorari
to
review
a
judgment
of
the
court
of
claim.
the
suit
there
was
begun
by
the
administrators
of
the
estate
of
rose
mason,
who
was
a
restricted
osage
indian,
acting
pursuant
to
this
court’s
decision
in
west
against
the
oklahoma
tax
commission
in
334
u.s.
the
osage
agency
of
the
department
of
the
interior
filed
an
oklahoma
estate
tax
return
on
her
estate
and
paid
the
tax
due.
the
claim
in
the
suit
in
the
court
below
is
that
this
payment
though
in
conformity
with
a
decision
of
this
court
conceded
to
be
squarely
in
point
and
not
overruled,
was
in
fact
a
breach
of
trust,
because
the
united
states
should
have
known
that
the
west
case
would
be
overruled
by
this
court.
the
court
of
claim
so
held
and
held
the
united
states
liable
to
the
estate
for
the
amount
of
the
tax
paid.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes
mr.
chief
justice,
i
think
that's
true,
but
i
suppose
that's
almost
always
true
with
respect
to
a
trustee.
if
there
is
a
decision
20
years
old,
maybe
there
are
various
things
which
might
have
happened,
and
he
ought
to
present
it
to
a
court
again.
i
think
that
the
question
of
the
duty
of
a
subordinate
agency
of
the
united
states
to
question
decision
of
this
court
ought
not
to
arise
to
the
dignity
of
a
breach
of
trust.
at
any
rate,
that's
the
issue
in
this
case.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
believe
that
the
items
are
indicated
on
page
6
of
the
appendix
and
they
would
appear
on
a
quick
addition
to
come
to
about
a
$125,000
for
the
estate,
osage
headrights
48,000,
security
of
sales
and
trust
19,000,
surplus
trust
funds
48,000
and
two
other
items.
on
the
quick
adding
i
get
something
like
a
$120,000-125,000,
on
which
the
tax
paid
was
$7,700.
the
united
stated
brought
oklahoma
into
the
case
there
as
a
third-party
defendant
and
the
court
below
also
held
that
oklahoma
was
liable
to
the
united
states
in
the
amount
of
the
tax.
both
oklahoma
and
the
united
have
sought
review
of
this
decision,
and
i
shall
appear
for
a
20
minutes
and
mr.
duncan
representing
oklahoma
will
use
the
other
10
minutes.
in
order
to
determine
whether
the
united
states
committed
a
breach
of
trust
it
will
be
necessary
to
review
some
decisions.
now,
there
are
three
decisions
of
this
court
which
are
particularly
relative.
the
first
of
these
decided
30
years
ago,
oklahoma
tax
commission
against
the
united
states,
an
opinion
by
justice
black
dealt
with
restricted
osage
property,
and
although
the
united
stated
appeared
there
and
vigorously
contended
as
it
shown
by
the
brief
file,
that
the
restricted
osage
property
was
not
subject
to
oklahoma
inheritance
tax.
this
court
reviewed
the
situation,
concluded
that
there
was
nothing
in
the
osage
allotment
act
which
a
established
a
tax
exemption
and
directly
held
that
the
restricted
property
was
subject
to
oklahoma
inheritance
tax.
justice
murphy
dissented
in
was
one
of
the
dissenters
in
that
case,
but
just
five
years
later
there
came
up
the
case
of
west
against
the
oklahoma
tax
commission
in
334
u.s.
where
justice
murphy
wrote
the
opinion.
that
case
involved
property
held
in
trust
for
an
osage
indian.
identical
types
of
property
to
that
which
is
involved
here,
item
by
item,
the
same
types
of
property,
trust
property
and
the
court
again,
revealing
the
situation,
held
that
the
oklahoma
inheritance
tax
was
applicable
to
property
held
in
trust
by
the
united
states
for
an
osage
indian.
it
was
less
than
eight
years
later
that
third
of
these
cases
came
to
the
court.
now
that
is
squire
against
capoeman
in
351
u.s,
an
opinion
by
chief
justice
warren.
that
case
involved
quinaielt
indians
in
the
sate
of
washington
under
a
different
statued,
the
general
allotment
act.
it
was
an
income
tax
case
not
an
inheritance
tax
case;
it
was
a
federal
income
tax
case,
where
the
guardian
was
seeking
to
take
a
tax
from
the
words
property
and
it
was
a
tax
on
capital
gain
derived
from
the
sale
of
timber
on
the
indians
land
when
the
timber
constituted
the
only
substantial
value
of
those
lands.
and
the
court
and
squire
and
capoeman
held
that
that
federal
income
tax
was
not
due.
i
think
it
can
surely
be
said
though
that
the
squire
court
did
not
understand
that
it
was
overruling
the
west
case
nor
was
its
decision
so
understood
by
others
at
that
time.
it
can
be
said
that
the
approach
of
the
court
in
the
west
case
--
in
the
squire
case
was
not
wholly
consistent
with
that
of
the
court
in
the
west
case.
but
the
cases
were
distinguishable
as
i
have
said,
west
was
an
inheritance
tax
case
or
squire
was
an
income
tax
case.
west
involved
a
state
tax
or
squire
involved
a
federal
tax.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no
mr.
justice,
i
think
there
are
clear
distinctions
between
the
osage
allotment
act
and
the
general
allotment
act
including
the
two
items
that
were
specifically
relied
on
by
the
court
in
the
west
case.
the
obligation
to
return
the
property,
i
forgot
the
exact
word
i
was
about
to
say
undiminished,
but
i
am
not
sure
that
is
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
sorry
mr.
justice?
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
in
the
squire
case,
the
general
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
the
obligation
to
return
the
property
and
a
provision
that
the
property
should
be
subject
to
taxation
after
a
certain
date
which
carried
an
implication
that
it
was
not
subject
to
taxation
beforehand.
the
court
of
claims
relied
on
certain
subsequent
developments,
a
decision
in
the
court
of
claims
in
big
eagle
against
the
united
states
in
300
federal
section
19
--
f.
2nd
1962.
that
was
a
federal
income
tax
case
and
the
court
of
claims
held
that
the
squire
case
meant
that
the
federal
income
tax
could
not
be
collected
from
trust
property,
such
as
is
involved
here.
and
there
is
a
later
case
in
1968
called
beartrack
against
the
united
states,
where
the
united
states
settled
by
payment
in
full.
i
don't
want
to
suggest
that
there
was
a
compromise,
because
of
doubt
about
liability,
settled
by
payment
in
full.
a
federal
estate
tax
case
involving
osage
property,
and
finally
after
the
text
was
paid
here,
and
incidentally
the
beartrack
case
was
after
most
of
the
tax
was
paid
here.
in
revenue
ruling
69-164
in
1969,
the
treasury
issued
a
ruling
that
osage
trust
property
is
not
subject
to
the
federal
estate
tax.
whether
these
actions
were
right
or
wrong,
they
did
not
deal
directly
with
the
question
of
the
liability
of
the
estate
of
an
osage
indian
or
estate
inheritance
taxes.
moreover
they
were
actions
taken
by
the
treasury
and
the
justice
departments.
now,
the
government
is
necessarily
large
in
complex
with
many
subdivisions
of
responsibilities
and
it
is
asking
a
lot
through
a
subordinate
office
of
the
interior
department
in
oklahoma
to
keep
abreast
of
these
developments
in
other
departments
on
a
matter
not
directly
in
point.
now
this
court
had
decided
the
west
case.
this
was
known
to
the
appropriate
officers
of
the
interior
department.
they
acted
accordingly.
they
ought
to
be
able
to
rely
on
a
decision
of
this
court,
which
has
not
been
overruled
nor
even
remotely
questioned
here.
in
this
connection
i
would
like
to
call
attention
to
the
decisions
of
this
court
just
three
weeks
ago
yesterday
in
mcclanahan
against
the
arizona
state
tax
commission
and
the
mescalero
apache
tribe
against
jones.
not
only
do
these
cases
show
the
extreme
complexity
and
uncertainty
of
the
field
of
state
taxation
of
indians,
but
in
the
mescalero
case,
this
court,
on
page
11,
cited
oklahoma
tax
commission
against
the
united
states
and
squire
against
capoeman
in
the
same
paragraph
indeed
back-to-back
it
might
be
said.
now
oklahoma
tax
commission
was
the
case
on
which
the
west
decision
is
based
and
it
hardly
seems
likely
that
this
court
three
weeks
ago
contemplated
that
squired
had
overruled
oklahoma
tax
commission.
squire
is
a
case
to
be
dealt
with,
of
course,
but
it's
a
federal
income
tax
case
involving
a
very
special
kind
of
income
tax,
a
capital
gains
tax,
imposed
on
the
realization
of
most
of
the
value
of
the
indians’
property
by
the
sale
of
the
timber
which
gave
it
its
value.
oklahoma
tax
commission
and
west
involve
a
estate
inheritance
tax
often
treated
differently
from
an
income
tax
as
in
the
case,
for
example,
of
the
federal
estate
tax
as
applied
to
the
transfer
of
state
municipal
bonds
where
the
income
is
not
taxable,
but
the
court,
over
a
period
of
75
years,
has
held
that
a
transfer
tax
on
death
can
properly
be
collected,
or
so
a
responsible
officer
in
the
osage
agency
in
oklahoma
might
have
understood
and
felt
and
acted
accordingly.
by
appropriate
standards
of
the
law
of
trust
this
was
not
a
breach
of
trust,
we
contend,
and
the
united
states
should
not
have
been
held
liable
for
complying
with
a
decision
of
this
court.
the
liability
imposed
here
is
so
novel
that
we
have
not
been
able
to
find
trust
decisions
directly
in
point,
but
we
have
cited
professors
scott’s
strides
and
we
believe
it
supports
our
position
that
the
court
of
claims
went
too
far
in
finding
liability
here.
of
course
if
the
united
states
is
liable,
we
support
the
decision
below
in
holding
that
oklahoma
is
liable
to
indemnify
the
united
states
as
a
third-party
defendant.
the
ultimate
question
here,
of
course,
is
whether
west
should
be
overruled.
on
that
question
i
find
myself
in
a
dilemma
where
the
united
states
is
trustee
for
the
indians
and
i
am
obligated
to
represent
the
indians
as
i
did
here
last
monday.
and
the
united
states
is
been
held
liable
and
has
tax
revenues
taken
the
general
situation,
and
i
am
obligated
to
represent
the
united
states
in
the
capacity
too.
in
private
practice
when
such
a
conflict
of
interest
develops,
a
lawyer
must
withdraw
from
one
of
the
representations.
now
that
is
not
so
easy
in
public
office.
we
have
only
limited
authority
to
retain
outside
counsel
and
even
if
such
counsel
were
retained
they
would
still
be
subject
to
the
overall
authority
of
the
attorney
general
and
the
conflict
would
remain.
it
is
inherent
in
the
situation.
the
president
has
asked
congress
to
establish
an
indian
trust
council
authority,
which
would
resolve
this
particular
problem,
but
this
is
not
been
done.
it
has
been
suggested
that
the
solicitor
general
might
ask
various
interested
agencies
of
the
government
to
file
briefs
or
to
incorporate
the
view
of
the
different
agencies
in
a
single
brief.
it
is
not
clear
though
that
this
would
always
meet
the
responsibility
of
the
solicitor
general
to
this
court.
for
one
of
the
functions
of
this
solicitor
general,
i
suppose,
is
to
reconcile
and
ajust
diversion
views
of
government
officers,
and
so
far
as
possible
to
present
a
single
view
to
this
court.
now
this
area
can
be
one
of
great
difficulty,
where
there
are
often
widely
diversion
views
with
respect
to
indian
problems
depending
on
whether
one
looks
at
it
solely
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
indians
or
whether
he
seeks
to
deal
with
and
to
reconcile
as
far
as
possible
many
competing
governmental
interests,
such
as
the
taxing
power
or
the
law
of
governmental
instrumentalities
or
the
responsibility
for
the
enforcement
of
criminal
law.
in
many
cases
it
has
been
possible
to
work
these
things
out
and
to
present
a
unified
view.
that
was
done,
for
example,
mcclanahan
and
mescalero.
in
another
cases
the
difficulties
have
been
acute
as
in
the
agua
caliente
case
where
the
court
asked
the
solicitor
general
to
state
his
views
and
he
did
so,
although
endeavoring
to
make
it
plain
that
his
view
was
not
shared
by
some
other
officers
of
the
government.
in
this
case
we
have
filed
a
brief
in
which
we
have
endeavored
the
state
both
sides
as
fairly
and
evenly
as
possible
without
taking
an
official
position.
consequently
on
this
final
question
i
ask
the
court
to
consider
the
materials
in
our
brief.
if
the
time
has
come
when
west
should
be
overruled,
this
court
is
the
place
where
that
action
should
be
taken.
if
the
west
case
can
still
stand,
it
would
be
helpful
if
this
court
would
state
that
effect
and
in
terms
which
would
indicate
whether
the
decision
is
applicable
to
federal
income
and
the
state
taxes
as
well.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes
mr.
justice.
our
position
would
be
that
it
was
not
a
breach
of
trust
to
comply
with
an
outstanding
unqualified
decision
of
this
court
as
to
which
this
court
and
never
indicated,
in
any
way,
the
slightest
doubt,
and
as
to
which
only
three
weeks
ago
it
seemed
to
regard.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
we
would
press
for
reversal
even
if
you
were
to
overrule
it.
it
is
not
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
would
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
would
thank
so
mr.
justice.
i
have
never
been
able
to
see
any
distinction
between
the
restricted
property
in
this
case
and
trust
property,
and
i
think
the
court
in
the
west
case
regarded
oklahoma
tax
commission
as
the
clear
and
controlling
authority.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
not
necessarily,
although
it
is
quite
clear
that
the
actions
which
have
been
taken
by
federal
executive
representatives
have
been
taken
based
on
a
view
that
the
approach
in
squire
weakens
the
west.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
congress
could
say
so,
there
isn't
a
slightest
doubt.
congress
hasn't
said
so
the
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
influence,
mr.
justice,
by
impressions
created
as
to
whether
this
court
in
squire
so
impaired
the
west
case
that
yet
ought
not
to
be
followed.
there
is
no
view
from
congress
as
to
whether
the
tax
--
there
has
been
no
action
by
congress
in
this
field
from
the
beginning
and
certainly
not
since
the
oklahoma
tax
commission
and
west
were
decided.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no,
nor
agreed
or
disagreed.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
or
squire,
that's
right.
in
either
event,
the
court
should
reverse
the
decision
below
insofar
as
it
held
the
united
states
liable
a
breach
of
trust.
for
the
officers
of
the
united
states
should
not
rightly
be
held
in
default
for
failing
to
attack
a
decision
of
this
court,
which
has
never
been
qualified
or
doubted
here.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
may
it
please
the
court.
in
the
present
fluid
state
of
our
law,
court
spend
a
good
deal
of
time
going
over
all
ground,
that
is
the
situation
in
this
case.
the
case
is
here
on
certiorari
to
review
a
judgment
of
the
court
of
claim.
the
suit
there
was
begun
by
the
administrators
of
the
estate
of
rose
mason,
who
was
a
restricted
osage
indian,
acting
pursuant
to
this
court’s
decision
in
west
against
the
oklahoma
tax
commission
in
334
u.s.
the
osage
agency
of
the
department
of
the
interior
filed
an
oklahoma
estate
tax
return
on
her
estate
and
paid
the
tax
due.
the
claim
in
the
suit
in
the
court
below
is
that
this
payment
though
in
conformity
with
a
decision
of
this
court
conceded
to
be
squarely
in
point
and
not
overruled,
was
in
fact
a
breach
of
trust,
because
the
united
states
should
have
known
that
the
west
case
would
be
overruled
by
this
court.
the
court
of
claim
so
held
and
held
the
united
states
liable
to
the
estate
for
the
amount
of
the
tax
paid.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes
mr.
chief
justice,
i
think
that's
true,
but
i
suppose
that's
almost
always
true
with
respect
to
a
trustee.
if
there
is
a
decision
20
years
old,
maybe
there
are
various
things
which
might
have
happened,
and
he
ought
to
present
it
to
a
court
again.
i
think
that
the
question
of
the
duty
of
a
subordinate
agency
of
the
united
states
to
question
decision
of
this
court
ought
not
to
arise
to
the
dignity
of
a
breach
of
trust.
at
any
rate,
that's
the
issue
in
this
case.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
believe
that
the
items
are
indicated
on
page
6
of
the
appendix
and
they
would
appear
on
a
quick
addition
to
come
to
about
a
$125,000
for
the
estate,
osage
headrights
48,000,
security
of
sales
and
trust
19,000,
surplus
trust
funds
48,000
and
two
other
items.
on
the
quick
adding
i
get
something
like
a
$120,000-125,000,
on
which
the
tax
paid
was
$7,700.
the
united
stated
brought
oklahoma
into
the
case
there
as
a
third-party
defendant
and
the
court
below
also
held
that
oklahoma
was
liable
to
the
united
states
in
the
amount
of
the
tax.
both
oklahoma
and
the
united
have
sought
review
of
this
decision,
and
i
shall
appear
for
a
20
minutes
and
mr.
duncan
representing
oklahoma
will
use
the
other
10
minutes.
in
order
to
determine
whether
the
united
states
committed
a
breach
of
trust
it
will
be
necessary
to
review
some
decisions.
now,
there
are
three
decisions
of
this
court
which
are
particularly
relative.
the
first
of
these
decided
30
years
ago,
oklahoma
tax
commission
against
the
united
states,
an
opinion
by
justice
black
dealt
with
restricted
osage
property,
and
although
the
united
stated
appeared
there
and
vigorously
contended
as
it
shown
by
the
brief
file,
that
the
restricted
osage
property
was
not
subject
to
oklahoma
inheritance
tax.
this
court
reviewed
the
situation,
concluded
that
there
was
nothing
in
the
osage
allotment
act
which
a
established
a
tax
exemption
and
directly
held
that
the
restricted
property
was
subject
to
oklahoma
inheritance
tax.
justice
murphy
dissented
in
was
one
of
the
dissenters
in
that
case,
but
just
five
years
later
there
came
up
the
case
of
west
against
the
oklahoma
tax
commission
in
334
u.s.
where
justice
murphy
wrote
the
opinion.
that
case
involved
property
held
in
trust
for
an
osage
indian.
identical
types
of
property
to
that
which
is
involved
here,
item
by
item,
the
same
types
of
property,
trust
property
and
the
court
again,
revealing
the
situation,
held
that
the
oklahoma
inheritance
tax
was
applicable
to
property
held
in
trust
by
the
united
states
for
an
osage
indian.
it
was
less
than
eight
years
later
that
third
of
these
cases
came
to
the
court.
now
that
is
squire
against
capoeman
in
351
u.s,
an
opinion
by
chief
justice
warren.
that
case
involved
quinaielt
indians
in
the
sate
of
washington
under
a
different
statued,
the
general
allotment
act.
it
was
an
income
tax
case
not
an
inheritance
tax
case;
it
was
a
federal
income
tax
case,
where
the
guardian
was
seeking
to
take
a
tax
from
the
words
property
and
it
was
a
tax
on
capital
gain
derived
from
the
sale
of
timber
on
the
indians
land
when
the
timber
constituted
the
only
substantial
value
of
those
lands.
and
the
court
and
squire
and
capoeman
held
that
that
federal
income
tax
was
not
due.
i
think
it
can
surely
be
said
though
that
the
squire
court
did
not
understand
that
it
was
overruling
the
west
case
nor
was
its
decision
so
understood
by
others
at
that
time.
it
can
be
said
that
the
approach
of
the
court
in
the
west
case
--
in
the
squire
case
was
not
wholly
consistent
with
that
of
the
court
in
the
west
case.
but
the
cases
were
distinguishable
as
i
have
said,
west
was
an
inheritance
tax
case
or
squire
was
an
income
tax
case.
west
involved
a
state
tax
or
squire
involved
a
federal
tax.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no
mr.
justice,
i
think
there
are
clear
distinctions
between
the
osage
allotment
act
and
the
general
allotment
act
including
the
two
items
that
were
specifically
relied
on
by
the
court
in
the
west
case.
the
obligation
to
return
the
property,
i
forgot
the
exact
word
i
was
about
to
say
undiminished,
but
i
am
not
sure
that
is
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
sorry
mr.
justice?
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
in
the
squire
case,
the
general
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
the
obligation
to
return
the
property
and
a
provision
that
the
property
should
be
subject
to
taxation
after
a
certain
date
which
carried
an
implication
that
it
was
not
subject
to
taxation
beforehand.
the
court
of
claims
relied
on
certain
subsequent
developments,
a
decision
in
the
court
of
claims
in
big
eagle
against
the
united
states
in
300
federal
section
19
--
f.
2nd
1962.
that
was
a
federal
income
tax
case
and
the
court
of
claims
held
that
the
squire
case
meant
that
the
federal
income
tax
could
not
be
collected
from
trust
property,
such
as
is
involved
here.
and
there
is
a
later
case
in
1968
called
beartrack
against
the
united
states,
where
the
united
states
settled
by
payment
in
full.
i
don't
want
to
suggest
that
there
was
a
compromise,
because
of
doubt
about
liability,
settled
by
payment
in
full.
a
federal
estate
tax
case
involving
osage
property,
and
finally
after
the
text
was
paid
here,
and
incidentally
the
beartrack
case
was
after
most
of
the
tax
was
paid
here.
in
revenue
ruling
69-164
in
1969,
the
treasury
issued
a
ruling
that
osage
trust
property
is
not
subject
to
the
federal
estate
tax.
whether
these
actions
were
right
or
wrong,
they
did
not
deal
directly
with
the
question
of
the
liability
of
the
estate
of
an
osage
indian
or
estate
inheritance
taxes.
moreover
they
were
actions
taken
by
the
treasury
and
the
justice
departments.
now,
the
government
is
necessarily
large
in
complex
with
many
subdivisions
of
responsibilities
and
it
is
asking
a
lot
through
a
subordinate
office
of
the
interior
department
in
oklahoma
to
keep
abreast
of
these
developments
in
other
departments
on
a
matter
not
directly
in
point.
now
this
court
had
decided
the
west
case.
this
was
known
to
the
appropriate
officers
of
the
interior
department.
they
acted
accordingly.
they
ought
to
be
able
to
rely
on
a
decision
of
this
court,
which
has
not
been
overruled
nor
even
remotely
questioned
here.
in
this
connection
i
would
like
to
call
attention
to
the
decisions
of
this
court
just
three
weeks
ago
yesterday
in
mcclanahan
against
the
arizona
state
tax
commission
and
the
mescalero
apache
tribe
against
jones.
not
only
do
these
cases
show
the
extreme
complexity
and
uncertainty
of
the
field
of
state
taxation
of
indians,
but
in
the
mescalero
case,
this
court,
on
page
11,
cited
oklahoma
tax
commission
against
the
united
states
and
squire
against
capoeman
in
the
same
paragraph
indeed
back-to-back
it
might
be
said.
now
oklahoma
tax
commission
was
the
case
on
which
the
west
decision
is
based
and
it
hardly
seems
likely
that
this
court
three
weeks
ago
contemplated
that
squired
had
overruled
oklahoma
tax
commission.
squire
is
a
case
to
be
dealt
with,
of
course,
but
it's
a
federal
income
tax
case
involving
a
very
special
kind
of
income
tax,
a
capital
gains
tax,
imposed
on
the
realization
of
most
of
the
value
of
the
indians’
property
by
the
sale
of
the
timber
which
gave
it
its
value.
oklahoma
tax
commission
and
west
involve
a
estate
inheritance
tax
often
treated
differently
from
an
income
tax
as
in
the
case,
for
example,
of
the
federal
estate
tax
as
applied
to
the
transfer
of
state
municipal
bonds
where
the
income
is
not
taxable,
but
the
court,
over
a
period
of
75
years,
has
held
that
a
transfer
tax
on
death
can
properly
be
collected,
or
so
a
responsible
officer
in
the
osage
agency
in
oklahoma
might
have
understood
and
felt
and
acted
accordingly.
by
appropriate
standards
of
the
law
of
trust
this
was
not
a
breach
of
trust,
we
contend,
and
the
united
states
should
not
have
been
held
liable
for
complying
with
a
decision
of
this
court.
the
liability
imposed
here
is
so
novel
that
we
have
not
been
able
to
find
trust
decisions
directly
in
point,
but
we
have
cited
professors
scott’s
strides
and
we
believe
it
supports
our
position
that
the
court
of
claims
went
too
far
in
finding
liability
here.
of
course
if
the
united
states
is
liable,
we
support
the
decision
below
in
holding
that
oklahoma
is
liable
to
indemnify
the
united
states
as
a
third-party
defendant.
the
ultimate
question
here,
of
course,
is
whether
west
should
be
overruled.
on
that
question
i
find
myself
in
a
dilemma
where
the
united
states
is
trustee
for
the
indians
and
i
am
obligated
to
represent
the
indians
as
i
did
here
last
monday.
and
the
united
states
is
been
held
liable
and
has
tax
revenues
taken
the
general
situation,
and
i
am
obligated
to
represent
the
united
states
in
the
capacity
too.
in
private
practice
when
such
a
conflict
of
interest
develops,
a
lawyer
must
withdraw
from
one
of
the
representations.
now
that
is
not
so
easy
in
public
office.
we
have
only
limited
authority
to
retain
outside
counsel
and
even
if
such
counsel
were
retained
they
would
still
be
subject
to
the
overall
authority
of
the
attorney
general
and
the
conflict
would
remain.
it
is
inherent
in
the
situation.
the
president
has
asked
congress
to
establish
an
indian
trust
council
authority,
which
would
resolve
this
particular
problem,
but
this
is
not
been
done.
it
has
been
suggested
that
the
solicitor
general
might
ask
various
interested
agencies
of
the
government
to
file
briefs
or
to
incorporate
the
view
of
the
different
agencies
in
a
single
brief.
it
is
not
clear
though
that
this
would
always
meet
the
responsibility
of
the
solicitor
general
to
this
court.
for
one
of
the
functions
of
this
solicitor
general,
i
suppose,
is
to
reconcile
and
ajust
diversion
views
of
government
officers,
and
so
far
as
possible
to
present
a
single
view
to
this
court.
now
this
area
can
be
one
of
great
difficulty,
where
there
are
often
widely
diversion
views
with
respect
to
indian
problems
depending
on
whether
one
looks
at
it
solely
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
indians
or
whether
he
seeks
to
deal
with
and
to
reconcile
as
far
as
possible
many
competing
governmental
interests,
such
as
the
taxing
power
or
the
law
of
governmental
instrumentalities
or
the
responsibility
for
the
enforcement
of
criminal
law.
in
many
cases
it
has
been
possible
to
work
these
things
out
and
to
present
a
unified
view.
that
was
done,
for
example,
mcclanahan
and
mescalero.
in
another
cases
the
difficulties
have
been
acute
as
in
the
agua
caliente
case
where
the
court
asked
the
solicitor
general
to
state
his
views
and
he
did
so,
although
endeavoring
to
make
it
plain
that
his
view
was
not
shared
by
some
other
officers
of
the
government.
in
this
case
we
have
filed
a
brief
in
which
we
have
endeavored
the
state
both
sides
as
fairly
and
evenly
as
possible
without
taking
an
official
position.
consequently
on
this
final
question
i
ask
the
court
to
consider
the
materials
in
our
brief.
if
the
time
has
come
when
west
should
be
overruled,
this
court
is
the
place
where
that
action
should
be
taken.
if
the
west
case
can
still
stand,
it
would
be
helpful
if
this
court
would
state
that
effect
and
in
terms
which
would
indicate
whether
the
decision
is
applicable
to
federal
income
and
the
state
taxes
as
well.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes
mr.
justice.
our
position
would
be
that
it
was
not
a
breach
of
trust
to
comply
with
an
outstanding
unqualified
decision
of
this
court
as
to
which
this
court
and
never
indicated,
in
any
way,
the
slightest
doubt,
and
as
to
which
only
three
weeks
ago
it
seemed
to
regard.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
we
would
press
for
reversal
even
if
you
were
to
overrule
it.
it
is
not
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
would
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
would
thank
so
mr.
justice.
i
have
never
been
able
to
see
any
distinction
between
the
restricted
property
in
this
case
and
trust
property,
and
i
think
the
court
in
the
west
case
regarded
oklahoma
tax
commission
as
the
clear
and
controlling
authority.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
not
necessarily,
although
it
is
quite
clear
that
the
actions
which
have
been
taken
by
federal
executive
representatives
have
been
taken
based
on
a
view
that
the
approach
in
squire
weakens
the
west.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
congress
could
say
so,
there
isn't
a
slightest
doubt.
congress
hasn't
said
so
the
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
influence,
mr.
justice,
by
impressions
created
as
to
whether
this
court
in
squire
so
impaired
the
west
case
that
yet
ought
not
to
be
followed.
there
is
no
view
from
congress
as
to
whether
the
tax
--
there
has
been
no
action
by
congress
in
this
field
from
the
beginning
and
certainly
not
since
the
oklahoma
tax
commission
and
west
were
decided.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no,
nor
agreed
or
disagreed.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
or
squire,
that's
right.
in
either
event,
the
court
should
reverse
the
decision
below
insofar
as
it
held
the
united
states
liable
a
breach
of
trust.
for
the
officers
of
the
united
states
should
not
rightly
be
held
in
default
for
failing
to
attack
a
decision
of
this
court,
which
has
never
been
qualified
or
doubted
here.
