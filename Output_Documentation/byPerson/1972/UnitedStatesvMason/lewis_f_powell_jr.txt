suppose
if
fiduciary
had
not
been
to
government,
i
realize
you
have
an
indian
involved
here,
but
let's
assume
you
had
a
private
fiduciary,
a
lawyer
in
oklahoma
representing
a
private
estate
in
which
all
of
the
other
facts
and
circumstances
in
this
case
existed
substantially.
the
supreme
court
decision
not
overruled
except
of
some
lawyers
who
did
think
it
was
overruled
by
implication.
would
you
feel
that
that
fiduciary
was
subject
to
be
surcharged
to
same
extent
and
in
the
same
manner
as
the
government,
as
fiduciary
in
this
case?
