mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
one
point
brought
up
by
the
solicitor
general,
i
would
like
to
reply
to
immediately
and
that
is,
he
referred
to
conflict
of
interest
in
the
government
when
it
comes
to
representing
questions
of
indian
rights
as
are
raised
in
this
case.
he
said
that
some
times
it’s
possible
to
solve
the
problem
by
reaching
an
accommodation
between
divergent
views
of
agencies
of
the
government.
that
is
a
perfectly
correct,
tenable
way
to
handle
divergences
among
the
various
agencies,
which
are
not
trusties
of
the
indians
but
ones
you
see
the
government
were
in
the
half
of
the
trustee,
of
the
indians,
there
is
no
substitute
for
a
separate
voice
speaking
for
the
indians.
this
could
be
done
by
hiring
special
counsel
or
it
could
be
done
as
the
solicitor
general
referred
as
presenting
two
different
views
in
one
brief
and
that
was
done
in
steven’s
case
in
the
ninth
circuit.
last
year,
one
of
the
most
recent
cases
construing
capoeman
in
a
way
inconsistent
with
west.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
the
same
problem
occurs
in
the
public
defender
area
where
the
government
employs
both
sides
of
the
fence
there,
but
i
think
we
are
used
the
accepting
the
loyalty,
diverging
loyalty
of
the
both
sides
of
the
counsel
there,
and
i
think
that
could
grow
up
with
respect
to
indian
rights.
our
basic
theme
is
that
the
west
case
was
good
law
--
well
never
was
good
law,
but
was
entitled
to
be
followed
until
1956
when
capoeman
overruled
it.
you
don’t
need
an
expressed
overruling
of
a
case
in
order
to
render
it
bad
law
or
invalid
law.
capoeman
did
so
by
implication
and
so
we
say
that
when
capoeman
made
its
ruling,
it
related
back
to
west
and
declared
west
in
the
case
it
in
turn
defended
on
oklahoma
tax
commission.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
west,
to
this
day,
has
never
been
expressly
overruled.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
west?
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
yes,
your
honor.
it
was
overruled
in
1956
by
this
court.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
it
was,
by
implication,
and
--
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
the
trustee
should
have
advice
the
word
or
rather
should
have
taken
action
to
hire
an
attorney
and
have
this
question
resolved
in
1956.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
no,
it’s
the
solicitor
general’s
--
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
--
office
who
should
have
been
one
to
do
it.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
i
am
not
sure
i
follow
the
question,
but
the
united
states
--
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
eight
lower
courts
have
disagreed
with
you
your
honor
and
have
held
that
the
--
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
of
course
but
there
is
a
--
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
no
lower
court
can
overrule
this
court.
only
this
court
can
do
so
and
did
so
in
1956.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
well,
we
then
reach
the
question
of
fiduciary
liability
but
ultimately
we
would
win,
yes.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
i
think
it’s
a
necessary
conclusion.
it
has
been
suggested
during
the
argument
of
mr.
duncan
that
that
perhaps
all
these
court
needs
to
decide
is
that
west
has
never
been
overruled.
this
would
throw
us
back
to
another
court,
i
assume
to
try
another
way
to
get
a
ruling
of
this
court
that
west
has
been
overruled.
i
suppose
if
we
arrange
our
jurisdictional
amounts
properly,
we
can
go
in
the
federal
district
court.
we
could
go
through
the
oklahoma
state
authorities,
of
course,
and
come
back
up
here
that
way,
but
that’s
inevitable.
the
day
that
this
court
overrules
west
as
we
feel
it
will
unless
it
puts
a
dam
across
entire
tied
of
the
law
since
1956,
it
must
do
that
to
keep
west
alive.
if
west
is
overruled,
it
then
becomes
the
duty
of
the
united
states
to
get
that
money
back
for
the
indians
that
it
is
wrongfully
paid
over
to
the
state
of
oklahoma.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
if
west
is
as
i
said
--
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
west
was
decided
1948.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
yes,
the
united
state
is
not
subject
to
the
statue
of
limitations
at
least
until
1977.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
well,
that
could
go
back
to
1947.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
pardon?
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
well,
oklahoma
didn’t
collect
the
tax
earlier
than
that.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
we
are
just
dealing
with
24
years
of
taxation.
our
theory
is
that
whether
we
hold
that
the
fiduciary
duty
here
was
clearly
breached,
you
had
capoeman
in
1956.
it
was
the
talk
of
the
bar
whether
this
now
caused
a
reevaluation
of
west
oklahoma
tax
commission,
choteau
v.
burnet,
a
recent
dicta
in
that,
and
our
law
firm
began
litigation
the
following
year
of
which
this
case
today
is
in
combination
to
test
this
premise.
the
capoeman
case
was
also
our
case.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
well,
one
must
draw
its
own
conclusion
as
to
why
they
weren’t
cited.
my
by
conclusion
is
that
they
could
not
handle,
could
not
reconcile
capoeman
with
west
and
that
it
was
therefore,
wiser
for
the
sake
of
--
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
yes
but
there
is
so
parallel,
it’s
almost
impossible
to
reach
different
conclusions
under
them.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
yes,
of
course.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
no.
we
did
not.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
i
don’t
know.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
i
wasn’t
with
the
firm
at
that
time,
i
can’t
personally
answer
here.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
yes.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
i
don’t
know
your
honor.
it’s
my
recollection
from
a
reading
sometime
ago
over
the
brief
that
we
did
not
ask
that
it
be
overruled.
it
wasn’t
necessary
to
get
into
that.
it
was
--
it
would
have
been
easy
to
leave
that
for
a
later
day,
today,
but
to
conclude
my
point,
we
say
that
government
has
reached
to
his
fiduciary
duty
by
not
taking
action
after
1956
to
test
the
validity
of
west
and
see
if
it's
still
was
good
law.
certainly
there
were
good
minds
of
thought
that
it
had
undermined
the
west
case
and
if
the
duty
didn’t
accrue
then
its
certainly
accrued
at
some
point
over
the
years
up
to
the
time
where
it
actually
paid
the
tax
in
this
case.
there
were
seven
cases
decided
by
the
lower
courts
in
an
unbroken
row
deciding
that
the
capoeman
case
reverses
the
spirit
of
those
cases
in
the
1930s
and
1940s
which
include
west
and
oklahoma
tax
commission
that
they
didn't
hold
so
outlawed,
but
you
by
comparing
the
language
it
is
perfectly
plain
that
the
parallelism
was
inconsistent.
they
were
parallel
case
but
inconsistent.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
correct
and
we
would
take
that
position.
the
duty
of
the
government
became
more
and
more
pronounced
as
the
years
went
on
and
in
these
lower
cases
kept
ticking
off
entire
west
decisions
and
finally
in
the
--
when
it
pay
the
tax
–
it
paid
the
tax
in
two
bytes.
the
first
byte
was
september
1967
then
two
things,
well
and
the
beartrack
case
which
was
another
case
we
had
brought
involving
federal
death
taxes
which
cannot
be
distinguished
from
west
we
say
neither
can
an
income
tax
cases
we
say.
at
any
rate
the
beartrack
case,
the
government
gave
up
and
agreed
to
a
refund,
paid
the
refund
and
the
internal
revenue
service
subsequently
held
that
the
--
it
wouldn't
collect
federal
death
taxes
anymore.
after
that
the
government
still
pays
oklahoma
the
debt
tax
in
this
case.
we
say
by
that
time
all
the
bells
were
ringing
in
the
watchman
should
have
awakened
and
done
his
duty
and
did
not,
but
should
you
find
that
there
was
no
liability
for
failure
to
bring
suit
and
nevertheless
reach
the
west
case
and
in
this
case
and
a
squarely
brought
before
you
rethink,
should
you
just
agree
it
will
be
before
you
in
a
couple
of
years
later,
when
you
decide
there
was,
there
is
no
longer
good
law
of
you
do
at
that
moment
the
government
has
a
duty
to
file
suit
for
refund.
it
can
do
so.
it's
not
subject
to
the
oklahoma
statue
of
limitations,
that's
settled
law
and
therefore
it
could
go
back
and
collect
all
of
the
refunds
that
were
erroneously
paid,
especially
erroneously
paid
at
capoeman
case.
there
was
a
question
as
to
how
much
money
is
involved
here.
we
happen
to
know
something
about
that.
oklahoma
has
a
budget.
the
oklahoma
state
authorities
send
us
a
budget
and
for
fiscal
year
ending
1963
the
budget
would
be
$1.1
billion
of
the
revenues
to
cover
that.
$700
million
will
be
raised
by
oklahoma
from
it's
own
sources
and
$400
million
will
be
given
to
it
by
the
federal
government.
of
the
$700
million
raised
by
oklahoma
from
it's
own
sources,
largely
taxes
$15
million
comes
from
death
taxes
in
oklahoma.
of
the
$15
million
there
is
no
breakdown
to
show
how
much
was
osage
property,
but
the
osage
agency
has
a
advised
that
over
a
six-and-half
year
period
the
payments
to
oklahoma
averaged
$21000
a
--
$26000
a
year.
oklahoma
has
been
collecting
taxes
for
24
years
and
so
if
you
assume
that
the
$26000
a
year
is
an
average,
it
come
to
$624,000.
that
would
be
a5
total
refund
of
all
estate
taxes
ever
paid.
it's
a
--
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
osage
is
extremely
unique.
they
are
the
only
tribe
in
oklahoma
that
still
has
a
reservation.
they,
it
to
me
it
would
be
not
necessarily
true
that
other
tribes
would
have
a
change
in
their
tax
situation.
i
am
not
sure,
i
haven't
studied
it,
but
osage
is
the
only
one
with
a
reservation
in
oklahoma.
i
would
like
to
give
some
of
the
historical
background
because
i
think
the
court
should
have
this
when
it
considers
whether
the
west
case
is
still
good
law.
the
--
to
me
the
critical
fact
to
keep
in
mind
when
you
are
considering
the
west
case
and
the
oklahoma
tax
commission
case
is
this.
when
this
court
made
that
decision
involving
state
taxes,
it
was
assumed
by
everyone
that
this
indian
property
was
subject
to
federal
estate
and
income
taxation.
this
court
had
held
and
superintendent
in
five
tribe's
case
in
1935
in
a
broad
general
statement,
not
subject
to
qualification
that
indians
pay
income
taxes
on
their
trust
property
unless
there
is
an
express
exemption.
this
was
taken
to
mean
and
later
held
to
mean
that
indians
pay
taxes
like
everyone
else
unless
there
is
an
express
exemption.
by
1943
when
oklahoma
tax
commission
case
came
up,
it
was
generally
assumed
and
not
doubted
and
the
internal
revenue
service
was
collecting
on
this
assumption
that
federal
taxes
were
correct.
now
this
court
or
any
other
tribunal
would
have
a
very
hard
time
finding
the
state
taxes
should
not
lie
if
federal
taxes
would
lie
and
the
court
at
that
time
was
assuming
a
federal
taxes
did
lie.
it
has
said
as
much
with
respect
to
income
taxes.
the
internal
revenue
service
was
collecting
the
death
taxes.
now
the
court
in
west
and
oklahoma
tax
commission
really
made
a
ruling
of
law
which
should
not
be
overruled.
it
still
a
good
law.
it
said
after
reviewing
the
situation
and
finding
that
these
properties
were
taxable
it's
said,
however,
should
any
of
these
properties
not
be
subject
to
direct
taxes
than
there
would
be
no
death
tax.
that
is
a
rule
of
law.
we
say
still
good.
the
only
thing
wrong
with
those
cases
is
that
they
mistakenly
assumed
because
of
some
language
which
has
been
overruled,
now
i
will
show
in
while
in
a
minute,
that
the
osage
property
and
the
creek
property
in
the
other
was
subject
to
federal
taxation.
had
this
court
realized
that
federal
taxes
wouldn't
lie
and
it
later
held
that
in
capoeman,
well
then
it's
a
fortiori
that
it
would
not
have
held
the
tax
taxes
lie.
it's
an
error
to
a
law
of
state
taxes
if
federal
taxes
don't
lie.
the
state
taxes
are
not
fortiori
case.
now
as
this
taxes
of
history
that
explains
how
the
court
get
all
the
track
on
that
--
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
that's
right.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
well
no,
if
federal
taxes
then
a
fortiori
state
taxes.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
if
state
taxes
--
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
not
a
fortiori
but
very
compelling,
very
difficult
not
to
find
the
other.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
no,
no,
the
a
fortiori
runs
in
the
direction
i
said.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
no,
no
of
course
not.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
yes
it
is,
interpretation
of
statues.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
certainly
it
could.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
no,
of
course
not.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
right
nor
in
the
capoeman
case.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
we
say
that
the
construction
--
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
yes,
and
here
is
what
the
court
saw
in
the
capoeman
case.
it
saw
a
governmental
undertaking
when
this
tribal
property
had
been
broken
up
and
distributed
to
the
members
of
the
tribe,
it
saw
a
governmental
undertaking
to
hold
this
property
in
trust.
this
is
vital
to
our
case.
this
is
the
heart
of
our
case
to
hold
this
property
interest
until
the
indian
was
competent
to
compete
in
society
by
himself.
during
this
interval
he
would
be
trained
by
the
united
states
to
talk
to
manage
his
own
affairs
and
presumably
hopefully
soon
he
would
at
the
melting
pot
and
he
is
confident
as
anybody
else.
in
the
mean
time
this
property
was
beheld
in
trust,
undiminished
by
any
claims,
a
simple
indian
is
at
the
mercy
of
loan
sharks
and
speculators
who
want
to
buy
his
land.
congress
knew
this
and
so
have
made
the
land
an
alienable.
no
charges
or
incumbencies
were
to
be
placed
on
this
land
on
this
land.
from
this,
well
--
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
well,
there
is
no
mr
justice
blackmun.
there
should
because
no
question
that
the
death
is
not
significant
in
the
impact
of
this
tax
exemption.
exemption
carries
forward,
it
bridges
the
death
and
goes
until
the
heir
becomes
competent.
this
is
clear
from
the
language
of
the
general
allotment
act
which
says
that
the
united
state
shall
hold
this
land
in
trust
for
the
indian
or
in
case
he
dies,
his
heir
until
becomes
competent.
and
it's
also
expressly
so
in
the
osage
allotment
act.
in
our
brief,
in
footnote
on
page
11,
we
cite
four
of
the
many
references
to
the
concern
that
congress
cottage
had
for
the
heirs.
furthermore
the
west
and
oklahoma
tax
commission
cases
when
they
say,
if
this
property
is
exempt
from
direct
tax,
then
it
is
exempt
from
death
tax,
sort
of
forecloses
that
question
we
feel.
we
feel
that
the
capoeman
has
proved
that
these
properties
are
exempt
from
direct
taxes
and
that
therefore
under
west
and
oklahoma
tax
commission,
there
aren't
any
overruling
at
all,
they
are
still
good
law
when
they
say
that
therefore
no
death
tax.
so
we
don't
think
that
the
death
is
relevant
here.
but
back
to
the
general
allotment
act,
the
trust
relationship,
determination
of
the
trust
when
the
indian
became
competent,
the
freedom
from
the
charge
of
incumbency,
this
court
held
in
capoeman,
may
will
be
sufficient
to
support
the
tax
exemption.
now
there
was
more
in
the
capoeman
case.
now
the
general
allotment
act
was
passed
in
1887.
the
osages
weren't
allotted
and
incidentally
the
osages
were
left
out
of
the
general
allotment
act
by
a
fluke.
the
general
allotment
act
was
supposed
to
fly
to
all
indians
in
the
country
with
a
few
exceptions.
and
those
exceptions
were
the
indians
who
held
their
lands
in
fee
and
the
osages
were
believed
to
own
their
lands
in
fee,
but
because
they
were
in
oklahoma,
but
unlike
any
other
tribe
in
oklahoma
they
didn't,
their
lands
were
in
trust.
therefore
the
osages
were
not
under
the
general
allotment
act.
in
1903
this
court
held
that
when
the
general
allotment
act
exempts
land
from
levy,
attachment
or
the
charge
of
incumbency,
that
means
tax
exemption,
that
was
the
rickert
case
1903.
now,
the
next
thing
that
happens
is
in
1906.
congress
amends
the
general
allotment
act
and
it
says
that,
for
the
first
time
adds
the
idea
that
the
trust
period
can
end
sooner
that
the
25
years
extended,
if
the
indian
becomes
competent
sooner
than
that
time.
and
it
says,
“after
he
reaches
the
point
of
competency,
the
trust
will
end
and
he
gets
his
land
and
all
restrictions
as
to
alienation
and
taxation
are
lifted.
now,
this
implies
that
congress
thought
that
the
land
was
free
of
tax
after
that
point
and
well
so.
only
three
years
ago
this
supreme
court
in
1903
had
held
restriction
on
alienation
added
up
to
a
tax
exemption.
so
congress
assumed
on
very
good
authority
in
1906
that
the
restriction
on
alienation
was
equivalent
of
a
tax
exemption.
now
when
we
come
to
the
osage
allotment
act
also
in
1906,
we
have
congress
very
much
aware
of
all
this
at
the
time.
congress
says
that
the
osage
property,
the
tribal
land
will
be
alloted
to
the
individual
osages.
they
will
pick
160
acres
of
land
and
that's
going
to
be
tax
exempt.
the
rest
of
their
land
which
would
be
several
hundred
acres,
congress
said
will
be
taxable.
congress
expressly
said
that
this
land
would
be
taxable.
now
the
implication
is
that
when
congress
doesn't
say
the
osage
property
is
taxable
then
it
isn't.
when
it
came
to
the
minerals,
it
wasn't
was
to
just
divide
up
the
minerals
along
with
the
surface
rights,
so
what
they
did
was
they
took
they
whole
mineral
estate
as
if
it
were
a
single
body
or
reservation,
held
in
trust
for
the
osage
tribe
and
alloted
the
minerals
by
allotting
head
rights
to
the
individual
osages.
now
each
head
right
just
like
the
general
allotment
act
was
to
be
inalienable
until
the
indian
became
competent.
the
parallelism
is
compelling.
the
congress
also
permitted
still
another
tax.
in
1919,
this
court
had
held
that
---
because
congress
had
not
authorized
an
oklahoma
gross
production
tax,
no
such
tax
could
lie
and
that's
an
important
case.
it's
holding
that
silence
in
this
context
means
no
taxes.
so
oklahoma
then
went
to
congress
and
persuaded
congress
to
pass
statutes
expressly
authorizing
the
oklahoma
gross
production
tax
and
congress
did
so
in
1921.
from
that
day
to
this,
congress
or
oklahoma
has
collected
and
no
one
has
challenged
it,
the
gross
production
tax
on
all
this
head
right
minerals.
incidentally
there
is
so
much,
i
am
not
going
to
be
able
to
cover,
but
one
thing
i
wanted
you
to
know
that
these
head
rights
have
diminished
in
value
and
annual
income.
they
are
now
paying
about
$3,300
a
year.
in
the
1910s
and
the
1920s,
they
were
paying
enormous
amounts
of
money
and
i
am
sure
you
are
familiar
with
some
of
the
stories
that
arose
from
that
time.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
well
as
in
this
case,
certainly.
i
would
say
the
fiduciary
liability
doesn't
start
out
full
blown
in
1956.
there
is
more
to
the
story.
a
case
was
decided
in
57,
in
58,
62,
63,
66,
67,
two
in
68.
by
68,
when
this
tax
was
finally
paid
any
fiduciary,
in
my
opinion
any
fiduciary
would
have
been
surcharged
for
failure
bring
a
suit
to
get
the
question
cleared
up.
i
think
to
review
those
lower
court
cases
will
compel
the
same
conclusion.
they
don't
say
west
is
overruled.
they
don't
dare
tackle
it,
but
it's
clear
from
what
they
say,
that
they
are
just
regarding
it
less,
that
they
are
regarding
it
as
overruled.
and
a
lawyer
has
to
look
at
these
things
in
order
to
properly
advise
his
client
or
a
trustee
to
take
care
of
his
beneficiary's
property,
he
has
to
look
at
the
tide
of
the
law
that
flows
along.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
well,
you
say
that
in
capoeman
in
my
opinion
showing
that
you
--
there
are
many
ideas
in
that
case
that
you
still
have
full-blown
agreement
with.
the
citing
of
oklahoma
tax
commission
in
the
way
you
cited
it
in
those
cases
sheds,
in
my
opinion
shed
---
it
does
not
put
anyone
on
warning
that
you
still
think
west
is
a
good
case.
west
is
a
complicating
case
and
it
goes
with,
excuse
me,
oklahoma
tax
commission.
we
don't
ask
it
be
overruled.
we
ask
it
to
be
modified.
the
part
of
the
land
exempt
from
direct
taxes
is
also
exempt
from
death
taxes
is
a
good
ruling.
we
don't
suggest
that
that
be
overruled.
so
the
parts
of
west
--
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
excuse
me
your
honor?
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
well
the
case
is
perfectly
valid
and
accepted
by
the
bar,
the
indian
bar
with
that
respect,
federal-instrumentality
rule.
that
was
what
tax
commission
was
all
about.
that
was
in
the
midst
of
the
tumbling
of
this
federal-instrumentality
rule
which
courts
had
relied
on
for
indian
tax
exemption
and
it
wasn't
discovered
until
capoeman
that
there
is
another
basis
for
finding
tax
exemption
and
that
is
really
a
sounder
basis
where
you
examine
statutes
carefully,
the
suite
of
statutes
for
each
tribe
and
reach
an
individual
conclusion
for
each
tribe.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
i
am
not
sure
i
follow.
isn't
it
--
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
yes
i
was
following
an
idea,
first
born
in
the
choctaw
(ph)
case
1931,
carried
along
in
superintendent
of
five
tribes
--
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
but
capoeman
said
it
wasn't
necessary
to
do
that
and
that's
why
they
are
inconsistent.
they
both
can't
stand
together.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
it
does
your
honor.
it
most
assuredly
does.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
oh!
i
am
sorry.
no
the
united
states
is.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
well,
i
was
troubled
by
that
language
in
capoeman
because
that
language
harks
back
to
1924
attorney
general's
ruling
which
followed
a
line
of
cases
that
said
just
that.
now
that
line
of
cases
was
overruled
in
the
30s
and
40s.
i
confess
i
can't
remember
the
case
or
cases
that
did
it,
but
there
weak
read
when
capoeman
came
along.
the
strength
of
capoeman
is
in
examining
the
general
allotment
act
and
--
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
well
the
united
states
--
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
the
united
states
has
a
great
deal
to
say
when
this
oil
is
pulled
out
of
the
ground.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
but
if
the
guardian
is
not
going
to
tax
his
own
ward
that
it
is
always
been
regarded
at
least
by
myself
that
if
the
federal
tax
does
not
lie,
estate
tax
a
fortiori
does
not
lie.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
no
i
have
been
--
i
have
learned
through
many
cases
in
many
text
books,
i
reached
that
conclusion
through
that
and
that
is
the
way
i
see
it,
that
the
federal
tax
is
the
hardest
tax
defined
that
lies.
no,
i
am
sorry
the
estate
tax
is
the
hardest
defined
that
it
lies.
the
--
i
have
met
confusion.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
perhaps
what
i
meant
to
say
is
based
on
this.
the
state
in
order
to
tax
must
number
one
find
jurisdiction
and
number
two
must
find
congressional
intent
to
permit.
whereas
in
the
case
of
federal
tax
you
need
only
find
congressional
intent
to
permit.
you
do
not
have
the
jurisdiction
problem.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
capoeman
said
you
did
not
have
find
an
express
exemption.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
true.
an
argument
i
have
not
made
here,
but
have
made
in
the
brief,
is
that
the
osage
reservation
still
a
reservation
and
if
the
mescalero
case
applies
to
osage
then
oklahoma
has
no
jurisdiction
to
impose
any
tax
whatsoever
except
those
taxes
that
congress
has
specifically
authorized
which
would
be
a
tax
on
the
non-homestead
land
and
the
gross
production
tax.
so
we
rely
on
mescalero.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
correct.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
yes.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
it
is
petering
out.
the
figure
four
or
five
hundred
--
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
yes
it
is
gone.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
oil,
some
gas,
mostly
oil.
they
are
on
secondary
recovery
methods
now
and
that
is
going
to
peter
out.
i
would
like
to
make
one
final
quote
from
the
mescalero
case
which
also
supports
our
position.
mescalero
said
that,
“in
the
special
area
of
state
taxation,
absent
session
of
jurisdiction
or
other
federal
statutes
permitting
it,
there
has
been
those
satisfactory
authority
for
taxing
indian
reservation
lands
or
indian
income
from
activities
carried
on,
within
the
boundaries
of
the
reservation.”
now
as
we
argue
more
fully
in
the
brief,
we
question
where
oklahoma
gets
to
the
jurisdiction
to
impose
this
tax.
they
have
the
same
constitution
that
arizona
does,
it
disclaims
jurisdiction.
congress
has
to
permit
two
taxes
and
we
can
see
that
those
lie,
but
where
is
the
jurisdiction.
under
the
mcclanahan
or
following
his
quotation
from
the
mescalero
case
where
is
the
jurisdiction
to
impose
the
tax
in
this
case.
osage
is
the
only
reservation
left
in
oklahoma,
but
is
a
reservation,
shown
as
such
in
the
bia
maps.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
yes.
the
solicitor
general
suggested
that
is
not
alleged
in
the
record,
but
it
is
a
fact.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
that
is
right,
we
have
not
relied
on
that.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
one
point
brought
up
by
the
solicitor
general,
i
would
like
to
reply
to
immediately
and
that
is,
he
referred
to
conflict
of
interest
in
the
government
when
it
comes
to
representing
questions
of
indian
rights
as
are
raised
in
this
case.
he
said
that
some
times
it’s
possible
to
solve
the
problem
by
reaching
an
accommodation
between
divergent
views
of
agencies
of
the
government.
that
is
a
perfectly
correct,
tenable
way
to
handle
divergences
among
the
various
agencies,
which
are
not
trusties
of
the
indians
but
ones
you
see
the
government
were
in
the
half
of
the
trustee,
of
the
indians,
there
is
no
substitute
for
a
separate
voice
speaking
for
the
indians.
this
could
be
done
by
hiring
special
counsel
or
it
could
be
done
as
the
solicitor
general
referred
as
presenting
two
different
views
in
one
brief
and
that
was
done
in
steven’s
case
in
the
ninth
circuit.
last
year,
one
of
the
most
recent
cases
construing
capoeman
in
a
way
inconsistent
with
west.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
the
same
problem
occurs
in
the
public
defender
area
where
the
government
employs
both
sides
of
the
fence
there,
but
i
think
we
are
used
the
accepting
the
loyalty,
diverging
loyalty
of
the
both
sides
of
the
counsel
there,
and
i
think
that
could
grow
up
with
respect
to
indian
rights.
our
basic
theme
is
that
the
west
case
was
good
law
--
well
never
was
good
law,
but
was
entitled
to
be
followed
until
1956
when
capoeman
overruled
it.
you
don’t
need
an
expressed
overruling
of
a
case
in
order
to
render
it
bad
law
or
invalid
law.
capoeman
did
so
by
implication
and
so
we
say
that
when
capoeman
made
its
ruling,
it
related
back
to
west
and
declared
west
in
the
case
it
in
turn
defended
on
oklahoma
tax
commission.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
west,
to
this
day,
has
never
been
expressly
overruled.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
west?
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
yes,
your
honor.
it
was
overruled
in
1956
by
this
court.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
it
was,
by
implication,
and
--
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
the
trustee
should
have
advice
the
word
or
rather
should
have
taken
action
to
hire
an
attorney
and
have
this
question
resolved
in
1956.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
no,
it’s
the
solicitor
general’s
--
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
--
office
who
should
have
been
one
to
do
it.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
i
am
not
sure
i
follow
the
question,
but
the
united
states
--
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
eight
lower
courts
have
disagreed
with
you
your
honor
and
have
held
that
the
--
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
of
course
but
there
is
a
--
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
no
lower
court
can
overrule
this
court.
only
this
court
can
do
so
and
did
so
in
1956.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
well,
we
then
reach
the
question
of
fiduciary
liability
but
ultimately
we
would
win,
yes.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
i
think
it’s
a
necessary
conclusion.
it
has
been
suggested
during
the
argument
of
mr.
duncan
that
that
perhaps
all
these
court
needs
to
decide
is
that
west
has
never
been
overruled.
this
would
throw
us
back
to
another
court,
i
assume
to
try
another
way
to
get
a
ruling
of
this
court
that
west
has
been
overruled.
i
suppose
if
we
arrange
our
jurisdictional
amounts
properly,
we
can
go
in
the
federal
district
court.
we
could
go
through
the
oklahoma
state
authorities,
of
course,
and
come
back
up
here
that
way,
but
that’s
inevitable.
the
day
that
this
court
overrules
west
as
we
feel
it
will
unless
it
puts
a
dam
across
entire
tied
of
the
law
since
1956,
it
must
do
that
to
keep
west
alive.
if
west
is
overruled,
it
then
becomes
the
duty
of
the
united
states
to
get
that
money
back
for
the
indians
that
it
is
wrongfully
paid
over
to
the
state
of
oklahoma.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
if
west
is
as
i
said
--
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
west
was
decided
1948.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
yes,
the
united
state
is
not
subject
to
the
statue
of
limitations
at
least
until
1977.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
well,
that
could
go
back
to
1947.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
pardon?
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
well,
oklahoma
didn’t
collect
the
tax
earlier
than
that.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
we
are
just
dealing
with
24
years
of
taxation.
our
theory
is
that
whether
we
hold
that
the
fiduciary
duty
here
was
clearly
breached,
you
had
capoeman
in
1956.
it
was
the
talk
of
the
bar
whether
this
now
caused
a
reevaluation
of
west
oklahoma
tax
commission,
choteau
v.
burnet,
a
recent
dicta
in
that,
and
our
law
firm
began
litigation
the
following
year
of
which
this
case
today
is
in
combination
to
test
this
premise.
the
capoeman
case
was
also
our
case.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
well,
one
must
draw
its
own
conclusion
as
to
why
they
weren’t
cited.
my
by
conclusion
is
that
they
could
not
handle,
could
not
reconcile
capoeman
with
west
and
that
it
was
therefore,
wiser
for
the
sake
of
--
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
yes
but
there
is
so
parallel,
it’s
almost
impossible
to
reach
different
conclusions
under
them.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
yes,
of
course.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
no.
we
did
not.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
i
don’t
know.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
i
wasn’t
with
the
firm
at
that
time,
i
can’t
personally
answer
here.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
yes.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
i
don’t
know
your
honor.
it’s
my
recollection
from
a
reading
sometime
ago
over
the
brief
that
we
did
not
ask
that
it
be
overruled.
it
wasn’t
necessary
to
get
into
that.
it
was
--
it
would
have
been
easy
to
leave
that
for
a
later
day,
today,
but
to
conclude
my
point,
we
say
that
government
has
reached
to
his
fiduciary
duty
by
not
taking
action
after
1956
to
test
the
validity
of
west
and
see
if
it's
still
was
good
law.
certainly
there
were
good
minds
of
thought
that
it
had
undermined
the
west
case
and
if
the
duty
didn’t
accrue
then
its
certainly
accrued
at
some
point
over
the
years
up
to
the
time
where
it
actually
paid
the
tax
in
this
case.
there
were
seven
cases
decided
by
the
lower
courts
in
an
unbroken
row
deciding
that
the
capoeman
case
reverses
the
spirit
of
those
cases
in
the
1930s
and
1940s
which
include
west
and
oklahoma
tax
commission
that
they
didn't
hold
so
outlawed,
but
you
by
comparing
the
language
it
is
perfectly
plain
that
the
parallelism
was
inconsistent.
they
were
parallel
case
but
inconsistent.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
correct
and
we
would
take
that
position.
the
duty
of
the
government
became
more
and
more
pronounced
as
the
years
went
on
and
in
these
lower
cases
kept
ticking
off
entire
west
decisions
and
finally
in
the
--
when
it
pay
the
tax
–
it
paid
the
tax
in
two
bytes.
the
first
byte
was
september
1967
then
two
things,
well
and
the
beartrack
case
which
was
another
case
we
had
brought
involving
federal
death
taxes
which
cannot
be
distinguished
from
west
we
say
neither
can
an
income
tax
cases
we
say.
at
any
rate
the
beartrack
case,
the
government
gave
up
and
agreed
to
a
refund,
paid
the
refund
and
the
internal
revenue
service
subsequently
held
that
the
--
it
wouldn't
collect
federal
death
taxes
anymore.
after
that
the
government
still
pays
oklahoma
the
debt
tax
in
this
case.
we
say
by
that
time
all
the
bells
were
ringing
in
the
watchman
should
have
awakened
and
done
his
duty
and
did
not,
but
should
you
find
that
there
was
no
liability
for
failure
to
bring
suit
and
nevertheless
reach
the
west
case
and
in
this
case
and
a
squarely
brought
before
you
rethink,
should
you
just
agree
it
will
be
before
you
in
a
couple
of
years
later,
when
you
decide
there
was,
there
is
no
longer
good
law
of
you
do
at
that
moment
the
government
has
a
duty
to
file
suit
for
refund.
it
can
do
so.
it's
not
subject
to
the
oklahoma
statue
of
limitations,
that's
settled
law
and
therefore
it
could
go
back
and
collect
all
of
the
refunds
that
were
erroneously
paid,
especially
erroneously
paid
at
capoeman
case.
there
was
a
question
as
to
how
much
money
is
involved
here.
we
happen
to
know
something
about
that.
oklahoma
has
a
budget.
the
oklahoma
state
authorities
send
us
a
budget
and
for
fiscal
year
ending
1963
the
budget
would
be
$1.1
billion
of
the
revenues
to
cover
that.
$700
million
will
be
raised
by
oklahoma
from
it's
own
sources
and
$400
million
will
be
given
to
it
by
the
federal
government.
of
the
$700
million
raised
by
oklahoma
from
it's
own
sources,
largely
taxes
$15
million
comes
from
death
taxes
in
oklahoma.
of
the
$15
million
there
is
no
breakdown
to
show
how
much
was
osage
property,
but
the
osage
agency
has
a
advised
that
over
a
six-and-half
year
period
the
payments
to
oklahoma
averaged
$21000
a
--
$26000
a
year.
oklahoma
has
been
collecting
taxes
for
24
years
and
so
if
you
assume
that
the
$26000
a
year
is
an
average,
it
come
to
$624,000.
that
would
be
a5
total
refund
of
all
estate
taxes
ever
paid.
it's
a
--
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
osage
is
extremely
unique.
they
are
the
only
tribe
in
oklahoma
that
still
has
a
reservation.
they,
it
to
me
it
would
be
not
necessarily
true
that
other
tribes
would
have
a
change
in
their
tax
situation.
i
am
not
sure,
i
haven't
studied
it,
but
osage
is
the
only
one
with
a
reservation
in
oklahoma.
i
would
like
to
give
some
of
the
historical
background
because
i
think
the
court
should
have
this
when
it
considers
whether
the
west
case
is
still
good
law.
the
--
to
me
the
critical
fact
to
keep
in
mind
when
you
are
considering
the
west
case
and
the
oklahoma
tax
commission
case
is
this.
when
this
court
made
that
decision
involving
state
taxes,
it
was
assumed
by
everyone
that
this
indian
property
was
subject
to
federal
estate
and
income
taxation.
this
court
had
held
and
superintendent
in
five
tribe's
case
in
1935
in
a
broad
general
statement,
not
subject
to
qualification
that
indians
pay
income
taxes
on
their
trust
property
unless
there
is
an
express
exemption.
this
was
taken
to
mean
and
later
held
to
mean
that
indians
pay
taxes
like
everyone
else
unless
there
is
an
express
exemption.
by
1943
when
oklahoma
tax
commission
case
came
up,
it
was
generally
assumed
and
not
doubted
and
the
internal
revenue
service
was
collecting
on
this
assumption
that
federal
taxes
were
correct.
now
this
court
or
any
other
tribunal
would
have
a
very
hard
time
finding
the
state
taxes
should
not
lie
if
federal
taxes
would
lie
and
the
court
at
that
time
was
assuming
a
federal
taxes
did
lie.
it
has
said
as
much
with
respect
to
income
taxes.
the
internal
revenue
service
was
collecting
the
death
taxes.
now
the
court
in
west
and
oklahoma
tax
commission
really
made
a
ruling
of
law
which
should
not
be
overruled.
it
still
a
good
law.
it
said
after
reviewing
the
situation
and
finding
that
these
properties
were
taxable
it's
said,
however,
should
any
of
these
properties
not
be
subject
to
direct
taxes
than
there
would
be
no
death
tax.
that
is
a
rule
of
law.
we
say
still
good.
the
only
thing
wrong
with
those
cases
is
that
they
mistakenly
assumed
because
of
some
language
which
has
been
overruled,
now
i
will
show
in
while
in
a
minute,
that
the
osage
property
and
the
creek
property
in
the
other
was
subject
to
federal
taxation.
had
this
court
realized
that
federal
taxes
wouldn't
lie
and
it
later
held
that
in
capoeman,
well
then
it's
a
fortiori
that
it
would
not
have
held
the
tax
taxes
lie.
it's
an
error
to
a
law
of
state
taxes
if
federal
taxes
don't
lie.
the
state
taxes
are
not
fortiori
case.
now
as
this
taxes
of
history
that
explains
how
the
court
get
all
the
track
on
that
--
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
that's
right.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
well
no,
if
federal
taxes
then
a
fortiori
state
taxes.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
if
state
taxes
--
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
not
a
fortiori
but
very
compelling,
very
difficult
not
to
find
the
other.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
no,
no,
the
a
fortiori
runs
in
the
direction
i
said.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
no,
no
of
course
not.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
yes
it
is,
interpretation
of
statues.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
certainly
it
could.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
no,
of
course
not.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
right
nor
in
the
capoeman
case.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
we
say
that
the
construction
--
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
yes,
and
here
is
what
the
court
saw
in
the
capoeman
case.
it
saw
a
governmental
undertaking
when
this
tribal
property
had
been
broken
up
and
distributed
to
the
members
of
the
tribe,
it
saw
a
governmental
undertaking
to
hold
this
property
in
trust.
this
is
vital
to
our
case.
this
is
the
heart
of
our
case
to
hold
this
property
interest
until
the
indian
was
competent
to
compete
in
society
by
himself.
during
this
interval
he
would
be
trained
by
the
united
states
to
talk
to
manage
his
own
affairs
and
presumably
hopefully
soon
he
would
at
the
melting
pot
and
he
is
confident
as
anybody
else.
in
the
mean
time
this
property
was
beheld
in
trust,
undiminished
by
any
claims,
a
simple
indian
is
at
the
mercy
of
loan
sharks
and
speculators
who
want
to
buy
his
land.
congress
knew
this
and
so
have
made
the
land
an
alienable.
no
charges
or
incumbencies
were
to
be
placed
on
this
land
on
this
land.
from
this,
well
--
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
well,
there
is
no
mr
justice
blackmun.
there
should
because
no
question
that
the
death
is
not
significant
in
the
impact
of
this
tax
exemption.
exemption
carries
forward,
it
bridges
the
death
and
goes
until
the
heir
becomes
competent.
this
is
clear
from
the
language
of
the
general
allotment
act
which
says
that
the
united
state
shall
hold
this
land
in
trust
for
the
indian
or
in
case
he
dies,
his
heir
until
becomes
competent.
and
it's
also
expressly
so
in
the
osage
allotment
act.
in
our
brief,
in
footnote
on
page
11,
we
cite
four
of
the
many
references
to
the
concern
that
congress
cottage
had
for
the
heirs.
furthermore
the
west
and
oklahoma
tax
commission
cases
when
they
say,
if
this
property
is
exempt
from
direct
tax,
then
it
is
exempt
from
death
tax,
sort
of
forecloses
that
question
we
feel.
we
feel
that
the
capoeman
has
proved
that
these
properties
are
exempt
from
direct
taxes
and
that
therefore
under
west
and
oklahoma
tax
commission,
there
aren't
any
overruling
at
all,
they
are
still
good
law
when
they
say
that
therefore
no
death
tax.
so
we
don't
think
that
the
death
is
relevant
here.
but
back
to
the
general
allotment
act,
the
trust
relationship,
determination
of
the
trust
when
the
indian
became
competent,
the
freedom
from
the
charge
of
incumbency,
this
court
held
in
capoeman,
may
will
be
sufficient
to
support
the
tax
exemption.
now
there
was
more
in
the
capoeman
case.
now
the
general
allotment
act
was
passed
in
1887.
the
osages
weren't
allotted
and
incidentally
the
osages
were
left
out
of
the
general
allotment
act
by
a
fluke.
the
general
allotment
act
was
supposed
to
fly
to
all
indians
in
the
country
with
a
few
exceptions.
and
those
exceptions
were
the
indians
who
held
their
lands
in
fee
and
the
osages
were
believed
to
own
their
lands
in
fee,
but
because
they
were
in
oklahoma,
but
unlike
any
other
tribe
in
oklahoma
they
didn't,
their
lands
were
in
trust.
therefore
the
osages
were
not
under
the
general
allotment
act.
in
1903
this
court
held
that
when
the
general
allotment
act
exempts
land
from
levy,
attachment
or
the
charge
of
incumbency,
that
means
tax
exemption,
that
was
the
rickert
case
1903.
now,
the
next
thing
that
happens
is
in
1906.
congress
amends
the
general
allotment
act
and
it
says
that,
for
the
first
time
adds
the
idea
that
the
trust
period
can
end
sooner
that
the
25
years
extended,
if
the
indian
becomes
competent
sooner
than
that
time.
and
it
says,
“after
he
reaches
the
point
of
competency,
the
trust
will
end
and
he
gets
his
land
and
all
restrictions
as
to
alienation
and
taxation
are
lifted.
now,
this
implies
that
congress
thought
that
the
land
was
free
of
tax
after
that
point
and
well
so.
only
three
years
ago
this
supreme
court
in
1903
had
held
restriction
on
alienation
added
up
to
a
tax
exemption.
so
congress
assumed
on
very
good
authority
in
1906
that
the
restriction
on
alienation
was
equivalent
of
a
tax
exemption.
now
when
we
come
to
the
osage
allotment
act
also
in
1906,
we
have
congress
very
much
aware
of
all
this
at
the
time.
congress
says
that
the
osage
property,
the
tribal
land
will
be
alloted
to
the
individual
osages.
they
will
pick
160
acres
of
land
and
that's
going
to
be
tax
exempt.
the
rest
of
their
land
which
would
be
several
hundred
acres,
congress
said
will
be
taxable.
congress
expressly
said
that
this
land
would
be
taxable.
now
the
implication
is
that
when
congress
doesn't
say
the
osage
property
is
taxable
then
it
isn't.
when
it
came
to
the
minerals,
it
wasn't
was
to
just
divide
up
the
minerals
along
with
the
surface
rights,
so
what
they
did
was
they
took
they
whole
mineral
estate
as
if
it
were
a
single
body
or
reservation,
held
in
trust
for
the
osage
tribe
and
alloted
the
minerals
by
allotting
head
rights
to
the
individual
osages.
now
each
head
right
just
like
the
general
allotment
act
was
to
be
inalienable
until
the
indian
became
competent.
the
parallelism
is
compelling.
the
congress
also
permitted
still
another
tax.
in
1919,
this
court
had
held
that
---
because
congress
had
not
authorized
an
oklahoma
gross
production
tax,
no
such
tax
could
lie
and
that's
an
important
case.
it's
holding
that
silence
in
this
context
means
no
taxes.
so
oklahoma
then
went
to
congress
and
persuaded
congress
to
pass
statutes
expressly
authorizing
the
oklahoma
gross
production
tax
and
congress
did
so
in
1921.
from
that
day
to
this,
congress
or
oklahoma
has
collected
and
no
one
has
challenged
it,
the
gross
production
tax
on
all
this
head
right
minerals.
incidentally
there
is
so
much,
i
am
not
going
to
be
able
to
cover,
but
one
thing
i
wanted
you
to
know
that
these
head
rights
have
diminished
in
value
and
annual
income.
they
are
now
paying
about
$3,300
a
year.
in
the
1910s
and
the
1920s,
they
were
paying
enormous
amounts
of
money
and
i
am
sure
you
are
familiar
with
some
of
the
stories
that
arose
from
that
time.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
well
as
in
this
case,
certainly.
i
would
say
the
fiduciary
liability
doesn't
start
out
full
blown
in
1956.
there
is
more
to
the
story.
a
case
was
decided
in
57,
in
58,
62,
63,
66,
67,
two
in
68.
by
68,
when
this
tax
was
finally
paid
any
fiduciary,
in
my
opinion
any
fiduciary
would
have
been
surcharged
for
failure
bring
a
suit
to
get
the
question
cleared
up.
i
think
to
review
those
lower
court
cases
will
compel
the
same
conclusion.
they
don't
say
west
is
overruled.
they
don't
dare
tackle
it,
but
it's
clear
from
what
they
say,
that
they
are
just
regarding
it
less,
that
they
are
regarding
it
as
overruled.
and
a
lawyer
has
to
look
at
these
things
in
order
to
properly
advise
his
client
or
a
trustee
to
take
care
of
his
beneficiary's
property,
he
has
to
look
at
the
tide
of
the
law
that
flows
along.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
well,
you
say
that
in
capoeman
in
my
opinion
showing
that
you
--
there
are
many
ideas
in
that
case
that
you
still
have
full-blown
agreement
with.
the
citing
of
oklahoma
tax
commission
in
the
way
you
cited
it
in
those
cases
sheds,
in
my
opinion
shed
---
it
does
not
put
anyone
on
warning
that
you
still
think
west
is
a
good
case.
west
is
a
complicating
case
and
it
goes
with,
excuse
me,
oklahoma
tax
commission.
we
don't
ask
it
be
overruled.
we
ask
it
to
be
modified.
the
part
of
the
land
exempt
from
direct
taxes
is
also
exempt
from
death
taxes
is
a
good
ruling.
we
don't
suggest
that
that
be
overruled.
so
the
parts
of
west
--
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
excuse
me
your
honor?
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
well
the
case
is
perfectly
valid
and
accepted
by
the
bar,
the
indian
bar
with
that
respect,
federal-instrumentality
rule.
that
was
what
tax
commission
was
all
about.
that
was
in
the
midst
of
the
tumbling
of
this
federal-instrumentality
rule
which
courts
had
relied
on
for
indian
tax
exemption
and
it
wasn't
discovered
until
capoeman
that
there
is
another
basis
for
finding
tax
exemption
and
that
is
really
a
sounder
basis
where
you
examine
statutes
carefully,
the
suite
of
statutes
for
each
tribe
and
reach
an
individual
conclusion
for
each
tribe.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
i
am
not
sure
i
follow.
isn't
it
--
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
yes
i
was
following
an
idea,
first
born
in
the
choctaw
(ph)
case
1931,
carried
along
in
superintendent
of
five
tribes
--
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
but
capoeman
said
it
wasn't
necessary
to
do
that
and
that's
why
they
are
inconsistent.
they
both
can't
stand
together.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
it
does
your
honor.
it
most
assuredly
does.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
oh!
i
am
sorry.
no
the
united
states
is.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
well,
i
was
troubled
by
that
language
in
capoeman
because
that
language
harks
back
to
1924
attorney
general's
ruling
which
followed
a
line
of
cases
that
said
just
that.
now
that
line
of
cases
was
overruled
in
the
30s
and
40s.
i
confess
i
can't
remember
the
case
or
cases
that
did
it,
but
there
weak
read
when
capoeman
came
along.
the
strength
of
capoeman
is
in
examining
the
general
allotment
act
and
--
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
well
the
united
states
--
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
the
united
states
has
a
great
deal
to
say
when
this
oil
is
pulled
out
of
the
ground.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
but
if
the
guardian
is
not
going
to
tax
his
own
ward
that
it
is
always
been
regarded
at
least
by
myself
that
if
the
federal
tax
does
not
lie,
estate
tax
a
fortiori
does
not
lie.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
no
i
have
been
--
i
have
learned
through
many
cases
in
many
text
books,
i
reached
that
conclusion
through
that
and
that
is
the
way
i
see
it,
that
the
federal
tax
is
the
hardest
tax
defined
that
lies.
no,
i
am
sorry
the
estate
tax
is
the
hardest
defined
that
it
lies.
the
--
i
have
met
confusion.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
perhaps
what
i
meant
to
say
is
based
on
this.
the
state
in
order
to
tax
must
number
one
find
jurisdiction
and
number
two
must
find
congressional
intent
to
permit.
whereas
in
the
case
of
federal
tax
you
need
only
find
congressional
intent
to
permit.
you
do
not
have
the
jurisdiction
problem.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
capoeman
said
you
did
not
have
find
an
express
exemption.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
true.
an
argument
i
have
not
made
here,
but
have
made
in
the
brief,
is
that
the
osage
reservation
still
a
reservation
and
if
the
mescalero
case
applies
to
osage
then
oklahoma
has
no
jurisdiction
to
impose
any
tax
whatsoever
except
those
taxes
that
congress
has
specifically
authorized
which
would
be
a
tax
on
the
non-homestead
land
and
the
gross
production
tax.
so
we
rely
on
mescalero.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
correct.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
yes.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
it
is
petering
out.
the
figure
four
or
five
hundred
--
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
yes
it
is
gone.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
oil,
some
gas,
mostly
oil.
they
are
on
secondary
recovery
methods
now
and
that
is
going
to
peter
out.
i
would
like
to
make
one
final
quote
from
the
mescalero
case
which
also
supports
our
position.
mescalero
said
that,
“in
the
special
area
of
state
taxation,
absent
session
of
jurisdiction
or
other
federal
statutes
permitting
it,
there
has
been
those
satisfactory
authority
for
taxing
indian
reservation
lands
or
indian
income
from
activities
carried
on,
within
the
boundaries
of
the
reservation.”
now
as
we
argue
more
fully
in
the
brief,
we
question
where
oklahoma
gets
to
the
jurisdiction
to
impose
this
tax.
they
have
the
same
constitution
that
arizona
does,
it
disclaims
jurisdiction.
congress
has
to
permit
two
taxes
and
we
can
see
that
those
lie,
but
where
is
the
jurisdiction.
under
the
mcclanahan
or
following
his
quotation
from
the
mescalero
case
where
is
the
jurisdiction
to
impose
the
tax
in
this
case.
osage
is
the
only
reservation
left
in
oklahoma,
but
is
a
reservation,
shown
as
such
in
the
bia
maps.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
yes.
the
solicitor
general
suggested
that
is
not
alleged
in
the
record,
but
it
is
a
fact.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
that
is
right,
we
have
not
relied
on
that.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
thank
you,
your
honor.
