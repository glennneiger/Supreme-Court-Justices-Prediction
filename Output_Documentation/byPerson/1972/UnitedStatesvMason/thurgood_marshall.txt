justice
thurgood
marshall
all
you
need
to
say
is
that
as
of
the
time
this
case
was
heard
in
the
court
of
claim,
it
was
a
good
law,
west
was
a
good
law,
that's
all
you
have
to
do.
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
was
the
law.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
you
don’t
need
anymore
than
that,
do
you?
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
hobbs,
it
has
never
been
overruled,
right?
justice
thurgood
marshall
as
--
it
wasn’t
my
question,

been
overruled?
justice
thurgood
marshall
yes.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
what
language

justice
thurgood
marshall
ah,

what
does
a
lawyer
do
when
he
is
advising
his
client;
he
tells
him
that
this
is
overruled
by
implication?
justice
thurgood
marshall
do
you
mean
he
could
have
gotten
a
better
timing
than
the
solicitor
general’s
office?
justice
thurgood
marshall
it’s
no
where
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
well
who
--
well,

justice
thurgood
marshall

question
is
where
you
have
got
the

that
is
on
all
forth
with
your
case.
how
can
you
get
better
advice
than
to
say
that
is
still
the
law?
justice
thurgood
marshall
we
are
not
considering
any
lower
court;
we
are
considering
a
decision
of
this
court.
justice
thurgood
marshall
now
what
court
of
competent
jurisdiction
has
overruled
this
court?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
even
if
this
court
now
says
that
west
should
be
overruled,
do
you
win?
justice
thurgood
marshall
(inaudible)
justice
thurgood
marshall
why
it
was
wrongfully
paid
over?
justice
thurgood
marshall
when
i
call
back
to
time
west
was
decided?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
does
it
go
by
there
from?
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
it
will
go
back
forever?
justice
thurgood
marshall
why
not
forever?
justice
thurgood
marshall
why
not
forever?
justice
thurgood
marshall
oh,
i
see.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
the
capoeman
case
did
you
ask
this
court
to
overruled
west?
justice
thurgood
marshall
why?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
said
it
was
so
horrible?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,

looked
into
the

didn’t
you?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
in
the
brief
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
did
the
brief
asked
that
it
be
overruled?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
about
the
solicitor
general's
suggestion
that
just
three
weeks
ago,
we
didn't
think
it
was
overruled?
