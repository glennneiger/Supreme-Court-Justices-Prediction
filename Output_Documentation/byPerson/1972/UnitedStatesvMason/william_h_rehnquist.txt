mr.
duncan,
a
following
up
on
justice
blackmun's
question,
i
can
certainly
see
why
the
solicitor
general
of
the
united
states
feels
itself
in
a
difficult
position
here,
since
it's
both
a
fiduciary
for
the
indians
and
representative
of
the
united
states.
i
too
was
surprised
to
see
that
the
state
of
oklahoma
didn’t
take
the
position
that
west
is
rightly
decided.
you
are
not
a
trustee
for
the
indians;
the
indians
presumably
have
very
capable
council.
you
have
a
decision
and
favor
of
your
state
that
says
you
are
entitled
to
tax.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
suppose
you
would
be
possible
to
decide
that
the
government
perhaps
did
have
an
obligation
to
begin
testing
through
litigation
after
1956
even
though
this
court
were
to
decide
and
west
was
still
good
law.
there
you
have
a
breach
of
duty,
but
no
damage
resulting
from?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
would
there
be
other
tribes
in
the
osage
involved?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
maybe
a
fortiori
is
in
the
other
direction?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
language
of
justice
stewart
quotes
from
capoeman
is
the
dominant
force
in
that
case?
