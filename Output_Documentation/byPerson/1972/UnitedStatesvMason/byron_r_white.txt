would

u.s.?
justice
byron
r.
white
would
overruling
west
take
with
it
oklahoma
tax
commission?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
a
state
privilege
to
tax
wouldn’t
mean
the
federal
(inaudible)
and
as
a
matter
of
federal
tax
policy
or
as
federal
--
the
federal
government
wouldn’t
need
to
impose
its
taxes.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
i
would
suppose
that
congress
expressly
said
in
so
many
words
that
federal
estate
taxes
to
apply
in
indian
property.
that
would
be
the
end
of
the
matter.
justice
byron
r.
white
it's
just
a
--
it’s
a
matter
of
administrative
application
of
the
existing
estate
tax.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
certainly
there
has
never
been
any
indication
that
congress
disagree
to
either
west
or
oklahoma?
justice
byron
r.
white
in
court
of
claims.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
a
lot
of
trust
properties
have
inspired
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
mean
--
and
so
the
client
(inaudible)
significant.
i
mean
it
isn't
going
to
go
on
forever?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
i
understand
that
you
position
is
on
the
refund
of
inheritance
taxes?
justice
byron
r.
white
now
what
--
the
oklahoma
tax
commission
against
the
texas
company
336,
that’s
also
involved
here.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
let’s
assume
west
--
let’s
assume
west
is
--
that
oklahoma
tax
commission
(inaudible)?
what
about
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
well
i
know
--
i
just
want
to
make
clear
that
you
would
--
you
conclude
that
the
texas
company
case
was
(inaudible)
than
west?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
the
court
--
i
thought
you
are
telling
the
court
was
relevant
enough
to
be
retained
its
client
--
and
do
you
think
west
oklahoma
relevant
enough
to
be
cited
in
there
because
that
was
--
if
they
were
cited,
they
were
litigated
within?
justice
byron
r.
white
was
there
a
law
of
enactment
involved?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
that’s
your
argument?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
am
looking
at
it
right
now.
justice
byron
r.
white
isn't
the
whole
question
a
statutory
question?
justice
byron
r.
white
strictly
statue
and
the
congress
easily
could
i
suppose
they
exempt
indian
property
from
it's
own
estate
tax
and
still
permit
states
to
tax?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
must
and
you
are
saying
that
--
you
are
relying
on
implied
exemption
from
state,
from
states
estate
taxes.
there
is
no
express
exemption
in
the
statute?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
there
is
no
expressed
exemption
in
the
regulations
or
anything
else?
justice
byron
r.
white
no,
no.
justice
byron
r.
white
except
with
the
court
read
the
particular
allotment
statue
there
to
imply
an
exemption.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
aren't
suggesting,
you
know,
a
return
to
federal-instrumentality
law?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
aren't
requesting
any
return
to
federal-instrumentality
which
oklahoma
tax
commission
is
heavily
involved
in?
justice
byron
r.
white
in
west
the
court
said
expressly
that
we
don't
find
any
exemption
here.
there
must
be
an
express
exemption.
we
are
saying
there
isn't
one
and
there
isn't
going
to
be
one
until
congress
comes
along
and
itself
gives
one
under
this
general
allotment?
justice
byron
r.
white
isn't
that
said
--
that
is
what
the
court
said
in

justice
byron

but
that's
what
it's
conclusion
was.
it
said
that
congress
in
effect
if
you
want
us
---
if
there
has
to
be
an
exemption,
provide
one?

it

the
