mr.
paul
c.
duncan
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
as
the
solicitor
general
has
pointed
out,
this
is
a
very
difficult
situation
which
both
the
united
states
government
and
state
of
oklahoma
find
to
serve
in
today.
state
of
oklahoma
is
in
particularly
difficult
position,
because
as
the
solicitor
general
indicates,
under
the
court
of
claims
decision,
if
the
united
states
is
found
to
be
liable
for
a
breach
of
fiduciary
relationship
then
the
ultimate
responsibility
for
the
payment
of
this
breach
rests
with
state
of
oklahoma.
now
since
1947,
state
of
oklahoma
has
gone
about
collecting
the
tax
in
question
conformity
with
this
court's
decision
in
west.
mr.
paul
c.
duncan
yes,
sir
i
have
--
would
not,
of
course,
in
this
particular
case
i
suggest
this
is
--
mr.
paul
c.
duncan
yes,
sir.
they
have
--
respondents
have
filed
a
class
action
lawsuit
with
regard
to
all
the
other
osage
indian
estates
so
similarly
situated,
and
although
we
have
not
been
able
to
arrive
with
a
figure
we
anticipated,
it's
actually
several
million
dollars,
depending,
of
course,
upon
what
timeframe
that
might
be
ultimately
applied.
the
court
of
claims
in
deciding
the
case,
did
say
that
as
of
1967-1968
when
the
rose
mason
case
came
about
that
the
federal
government
breached
it
fiduciary
relationship
at
that
time.
he
did
not
apparently
foreclosed
the
possibilities
and
under
different
circumstances
they
might
go
back
even
to
an
earlier
period
of
time,
some
time
i
guess
would
have
to
be
necessitated
by
the
advent
of
the
capoeman
case
in
1954.
it
couldn't
go
back
prior
to
that
time,
but
the
state
of
oklahoma
recognized
that
this
places
a
possible
severe
tax
brief
on
consequence
if
the
court
of
claim's
decision
is
to
allowed
to
stand.
mr.
paul
c.
duncan
well,
we
would
have
--
i
think
that
we
would
have
had
to
taken
the
united
states
to
court
--
mr.
paul
c.
duncan
--
in
reliance
upon
the
--
i
reliance
upon
the
west
decision,
yes
your
honor.
mr.
paul
c.
duncan
well,
i
think
that
the
practicality
of
the
situation
required
the
state
to
have
taken
the
government
to
court
with
regard
to
west,
whether
or
not
west
is
still
should
be
considered
with
law,
should
this
court
decide
otherwise,
would
not
place
a
severe
burden
upon
state
of
oklahoma,
if
we
are
talking
about
perspective
actions
only.
mr.
paul
c.
duncan
well
--
mr.
paul
c.
duncan
yes,
sir.
mr.
paul
c.
duncan
no,
that's
correct.
i
believe
there
are
approximate
there
--
it’s
in
neighbor
to
500-550
present
restricted
osage
indians
estates
at
the
present
time
or
osage
accounts
at
the
present
time
that
might
become
involve
and
--
mr.
paul
c.
duncan
in
the
future,
in
the
past.
mr.
paul
c.
duncan
no,
sir,
i
do
not.
in
with
regard
to
the
past,
we
do
not
have
any
information,
because
the
tax
has
been
paid
through
the
bureau
of
indian
affairs,
through
the
department
of
the
interior,
through
the
oklahoma
tax
commission,
as
with
any
other
estate
tax
we
paid
and
the
oklahoma
tax
commission
is
not
seen
fit
in
the
past
to
segregate
this
money
or
even
pave
your
ways
specific
accountancy.
accounting
of
the
money
is
collected
from
the
osage
estate.
if
some
rule
is
set
down
for
oklahoma
would
be
liable
for
all
these
in
the
past
even
to
1967-68,
we
would
have
to
go
back
and
rely
on
the
records
of
the
department
of
the
interior.
mr.
paul
c.
duncan
mr.
justice,
i
am
sorry,
we
gave
that
impression.
we
feel
feel
that
the
west
decision
is
good
law
at
the
present
time.
the
only
point
the
state
was
trying
to
make
in
its
brief
was
if
the
court
wishes
to
change
that
ruling
or
feels
that
way
should
no
longer
be
the
state
of
the
law.
it
should
not
impose
the
burden
upon
state
of
oklahoma
for
the
past
actions
of
the
federal
government
in
collecting
the
tax
for
the
breach
of
duty
of
their
own.
now
we
feel
that,
of
course,
until
this
court
says
otherwise
that
the
west
decision
unless
be
considered
good
law,
we
do
not
feel
the
capoeman
case
although,
the
rational
perhaps
is
different
in
the
capoeman
case.
we
do
not
feel
it
had
a
direct
overruling
effect
on
the
west
decision
and
the
west
would
still
be
the
correct
interpretation
of
the
law,
and
certainly
had
not
this
come
about,
we
would
still
be
making
every
attempt
to
collect
the
tax.
mr.
paul
c.
duncan
yes
sir
just
--
that's,
of
course,
what
we
argued
at
the
time
the
court
of
claim
--
mr.
paul
c.
duncan
well,
i
believe
that's
correct.
the
only
question
that
i
think
might
be
is
whether
or
not
you
have
overruled,
and
of
course,
i
think
the
resondents
take
the
position,
the
court
of
claims
takes
the
position
that
this
court
has
overruled
the
case
insofar
as
to
--
mr.
paul
c.
duncan
no,
that's
correct.
and
that
--
of
course,
we
have
relied
on
and
we
argued
this
before
the
court
of
claims
but
they
did
not
accept
this
argument.
it's
interesting
to
note
that
with
regard
to
this
undermining
our
eroding
of
the
west
decision,
the
court
of
claims
also
relied
upon
a
number
of
cases,
as
solicitor
general
has
referred
to
including
the
internal
revenue
ruling,
which
oklahoma
was
not
a
part
to
had
no
part
in,
in
which
the
state
of
oklahoma
takes
position
at
these
rulings,
by
an
inferior
court,
cannot
in
any
way,
although
they
are
expressions
of
the
interpretation
by
that
court
or
that
agency
with
regard
to
the
these
ancillary
tax
questions,
they
in
and
of
themselves
cannot
possibly
overrule
the
decision
of
this
court.
now
--
mr.
paul
c.
duncan
yes
sir,
that’s
exactly
--
mr.
paul
c.
duncan
that’s
right,
it
was
law
--
mr.
paul
c.
duncan
it
was
the
law,
that’s
--
mr.
paul
c.
duncan
no.
mr.
paul
c.
duncan
yes,
your
honor,
68
o.s,
section
227,
provides
for
the
general
timing
in
which
a
refund
can
be
claimed.
it’s
one
year
of
statue
limitations
when
it’s
a
mistake
of
law
or
a
question
of
law
or
on
three
years
on
question
of
fact.
however,
there
is
a
provision,
subtitle
2.
it
provides
the
estate
tax
must
be
questioned
at
the
time
of
payment,
and
this
would
fall
under
that
category.
so
at
the
time
they
would
have
had
to
have
contested
under
the
oklahoma
statute
at
the
time
that
this
payment
was
made.
mr.
paul
c.
duncan
well,
of
course,
the
court,
you
referred
to
it
in
your
opinion
in
mescalero
and
although
it
has
not
--
it
was
not
a
part
of
my
brief
at
the
time
it
--
we
were
relied
--
mr.
paul
c.
duncan
well,
i
would
like
for
the
texas
company
case
to
stay
however
if
the
west
decision
goes,
it’s
the
court
who
returns
the
west
decision,
which
is
the
case,
on
all
four
squarely
in
point,
it’s
hard
to
imagine
that
we
are
going
to
have
some
other
case
that’s
going
to
put
us
in
a
better
situation.
mr.
paul
c.
duncan
well,
i
would
assume
that
it
would
be
trouble
also.
mr.
paul
c.
duncan
yes

mr.

mr.

it
