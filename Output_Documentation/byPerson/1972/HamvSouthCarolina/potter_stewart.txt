mr.
shapiro,
do
you
have
your
brief
at
hand
there?
justice
potter
stewart
on
page
four,
the
--
right
after
the
quote
at
the
bottom
of
the
page
where
it
says
that
jurors
were
excused
that
should
be
two
jurors
should
it?
justice
potter
stewart
twl?
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
was
this
issue
raised
as
a
constitutional
issue
in
the
supreme
court
of
your
state?
i
noticed
on
the
opinion
of
the
court
at
least
as
it
in
affirmative.
it
appears
on
page
102,
there
is
just
a
brief
paragraph
discussing
this
and
it’s
all
in
the
terms
of
alleged
errors
in
the
matter
of
state
law.
nothing
about
the
united
states
constitution,
nothing
about
either
the
sixth
or
the
fourteenth
amendment
in
your
supreme
court’s
opinion
discussing
it
and
while
the
dissent
talks
about
a
supreme
court
case
which
it
says
in
which
decision
is
binding
upon
this
court.
i
think
that’s
you
would
agree,
that’s
probably
an
erroneous
statement
because
the
o’brien
case
was
not
a
constitutional
case.
it
just
was
a
matter
of
errors,
a
matter
of
administration
of
federal
criminal
law.
was
this
issue
ever
raise,
just
a
constitutional
issue
or
not?
it
doesn’t
seem
to
have
been
decided
as
such
by
your
supreme
court.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
do
you
place
any
reliance
on
that?
generally
speaking,
we
don’t
consider
questions
here
that
haven’t
been
raised
in
a
timely
way
and
up
through
the
trial
in
appeal
of
a
case
in
the
state
courts.
and
if
there
is
no
federal
question
properly
raised
in
this
court
we
have
no
jurisdiction
to
this
case.
justice
potter
stewart
which
is
not
a
constitutional
decision?
justice
potter
stewart
that’s
a
different
issue.
justice
potter
stewart
that’s
powell
against
alabama.
justice
potter
stewart
as
justice
rehnquist
implicitly
pointed
out
in
dealing
with
the
motion
for
a
continuance,
the
south
carolina
supreme
court
explicitly
did
deal
with
it
as
a
constitutional
question
citing
powell
against
alabama
and
so
on.
but
with
this
issue,
the
only
issue
now
before
us,
one
could
never
know
from
reading
the
opinion
of
the
south
carolina
supreme
court
that
that
court
understood
that
it
was
faced
with
the
federal
constitutional
issue.
justice
potter
stewart
but
where
are
those
cases
cited?
justice
potter
stewart
well
i
don’t
seem
to
have
that
both
if
you
file
it,
we
can
find
it.
thank
you.
justice
potter
stewart
of
course
mr.
shapiro,
of
the
four
questions
that
the
judge
refused
to
ask,
only
one
of
them
had
to
deal
with
pretrial
publicity.
the
other
three
had
nothing
whatsoever
to
do
at
pretrial.
justice
potter
stewart
so
that
if
you
are
right
about
the
first
three,
another
pretrial
publicity
doesn’t
really
--
isn’t
dispositive
at
all
in
this
case.
justice
potter
stewart
