chief

warren
e.
burger
we’ll
hear
arguments
next
in
71-5139,
ham
against
south
carolina.
mr.
shapiro
you
may
proceed
whenever
you’re
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
then
we
have
to
construe
that
record
as
meaning
that
a
request
on
the
part
of
the
counsel
would
have
been
fruitless,
is
that
correct?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
how
far
would
you
carry
the
specific
questions,
for
example
which,
if
the
request
had
been
made
do
you
have
any
prejudice
against
people
who
wear
pink
shirts?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
the
defendant
was
wearing
a
pink
shirt
or
his
counsel
was
wearing
a
pink
shirt,
do
you
think
that
inquiry
must
be
made?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
was
the
final
composition
of
the
trial
jury?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
does
the
state
require
a
unanimous
verdict
in
a
criminal
case
there?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
so
that
the,
either
one,
any
one
juror
could
have
prevented
the
verdict?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
i
am
to
take
that
the
answer
or
your
response
to
that
other
question
mr.
shapiro
that
you’re
really
concentrating
on
--
you’re
really
concerned
about
the
questions
on
a
racial
prejudice.
essentially,
aren’t
you
not
wearing
a
pair
of
your
own
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
are
you
saying
in
effect
mr.
shapiro
that
the
statutory
questions
that
are
required
there
might
be
entirely
satisfactory
for
an
ordinary
routine
case
but
that
when
special
factors
emerged,
the
constitution
requires
that
the
judge
exercise
discretion
to
cover
a
broader
range
of
inquiry
of
the
jury?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
now
on
the
aldridge
case
back
49
years
ago,
had
the
trial
judge
there
ask
any
questions
at
all
or
had
he
just
refused
to
make
any
inquiry?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
very
well,
mr.
shapiro.
mr.
quinn.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
where
do
we
find
them
in
the
record?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
returning
mr.
quinn
to
those
references
at
page
12
to
the
newspaper
clippings.
were
those
newspaper
clippings
put
in
evidence
and
are
they
in
the
record
of
the
case?
they
are
not
in
this
appendix
as
far
as
i
can
find.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
are
they
up
here
do
you
know?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
take
it
that
your
position
is
that
the
questions
that
were
asked
in
this
case
were
sufficient
to
flush
out
any
part
of
prejudice,
you
pointed
out
that
several
jurors
did
respond
that
they
could
not
be
fair,
they
were
then
excused.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
quinn.
mr.
shapiro
you
got
a
few
minutes
left.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
shapiro,
if
you
are
pressing
as
i
assume
you
are
the
pretrial
publicity
issue,
i’m
a
little
surprised
that
you
didn’t
put
in
your
appendix,
what
these
newspaper
articles
contain.
the
reference
at
page
12
doesn’t
really
tell
us
anything,
does
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
shouldn’t
they
be
if
we
are
going
to
put
the
situation
in
context
and
determine
whether
these
questions
were
necessary?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
doesn’t
the
content
of
that
publicity,
the
substance
of
it
govern
the
answer
to
that?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
maybe
he
thought
it
was
irrelevant
because
after
reading
the
newspaper
articles
he
thought
they
were
so
innocuous
so
vague
that
that
rendered
the
whole
inquiry
irrelevant.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
i
understand
that
the
page
12
that
he
did
hand
the
judge
clippings,
the
clippings
he
was
referring
to.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
they
just
aren’t
here
though.
chief
justice
warren
e.

you
