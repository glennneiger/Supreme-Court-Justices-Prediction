mr.
jonathan
shapiro
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
certiorari
to
a
decision
of
the
south
carolina
supreme
court
affirming
petitioner’s
conviction
and
sentenced
to
one-and-a-half
years
of
hard
labor
for
the
possession
of
marijuana.
the
certiorari
grant
was
limited
to
the
issue
of
whether
a
black
criminal
defendant
is
constitutionally
entitled
to
any
opportunity
to
examine
prospective
jurors
on
voir
dire
with
respect
to
whether
they
are
prejudice
against
him
because
of
his
race
or
because
of
certain
pretrial
publicity
in
the
case.
thus,
this
case
raises
for
the
first
time
in
this
court
as
a
question
of
the
right
of
a
criminal
defendant
to
examine
and
to
challenge
for
cause
a
jurors
who
are
called
to
decide
his
case.
we
think
that
that
right
is
a
part
of
the
constitutional
right
to
a
jury
trial
and
that
in
this
case
it
was
violated.
the
petitioner
is
a
black
civil
rights
worker
who
has
been
active
in
the
county
of
florence
in
south
carolina
as
a
representative
of
sclc,
as
well
as
at
the
time
a
member
of
the
bi-racial
commission
of
the
city
of
florence.
he
was
indicted
on
june
1,
1970
for
the
crime
of
possession
of
marijuana.
his
defense
in
the
case
into
trial
of
the
case
at
which
he
testified
was
that
the
charge
against
him
was
a
result
of
complicity
by
the
local
police
authorities
to
frame
him
because
of
his
civil
rights
activities.
over
his
objection,
the
trial
was
commenced
on
the
day
after
indictment
that
is
on
june
2nd.
although
petitioner,
his
counsel
sought
to
make
motions
for
a
change
of
venue
and
for
a
continuance
on
the
basis
of
pretrial
publicity
and
possible
prejudice
on
the
part
of
the
prospective
jurors,
he
was
unable
to
do
so
in
sworn
affidavits
as
required
under
south
carolina
law
and
rather
was
forced
to
make
the
request
orally
to
the
court
which
overruled
both
motions
summarily.
he
made
similarly
an
oral
motion
to
quash
the
trial
venire
on
the
grounds
that
blacks
had
been
systematically
excluded
and
after
a
hearing
on
the
june
2nd,
the
court
denied
that
motion.
on
the
next
day,
prior
to
the
selection
of
the
jury,
a
petitioner
requested
the
trial
judge
to
voir
dire
the
prospective
jurors
with
respect
to
several
matters
relating
to
whether
they
were
prejudiced
against
him
because
he
was
black
and
because
of
certain
pretrial
publicity
in
extrajudicial
statements
in
the
case.
specifically,
he
requested
that
each
prospective
juror
be
asked
whether
he
or
she
was
prejudiced
against
negroes,
whether
the
fact
that
the
defendant
was
black
would
affect
his
or
her
ability
to
render
an
impartial
judgment
and
verdict
in
the
case.
whether
the
fact
that
the
petitioner
was
bearded
would
make
any
difference
in
the
way
they
decided
the
case.
in
addition,
he
specifically
requested
that
the
trial
judge
asked
the
jurors
about
certain
publicity
which
he
claimed
had
poisoned
the
minds
of
--
or
possibly
poisoned
the
minds
of
persons
in
that
county
with
respect
to
persons
charged
with
the
crime
which
the
petitioner
was
charged
with,
and
also
with
respect
to
whether
any
of
them
had
heard
a
television
program
several
days
before
the
trial
at
which
the
state’s
chief
prosecution
witness
had
appeared
and
had
talked
extensively
in
connection
with
drug
crimes.
the
trial
judge
refused
to
ask
any
of
the
proposed
questions
on
the
grounds
that
they
were
irrelevant.
instead,
he
posed
three
questions
to
the
perspective
jurors.
he
asked
them
whether
any
of
them
had
formed
or
expressed
an
opinion
as
to
guilt
or
innocence
of
the
petitioner
whether
any
of
them
was
sensible
of
any
bias
or
prejudice
for
or
against
him
and
whether
each
of
them
could
give
the
state
and
the
defendant
a
fair
trial.
the
entire
examination
of
the
prospective
jurors
in
this
case
took
a
total
of
12
pages
of
the
record.
it
was
hurried,
formalistic
and
routine.
each
juror
as
he
was
called
and
sworn
was
put,
the
exact
same
question
by
the
trial
judge.
each
juror
with
two
exceptions
answered
the
questions,
the
first
two
question
no
and
the
third
question
yes.
no
further
examination
was
gone
into
in
any
case.
the
only
two
exceptions
was
one
juror
who
answered
the
first
two
questions
no,
but
in
response
to
the
third
question
said
that
she
was
rather
not
cert.
one
juror
said
that
she
had
a
formed
or
expressed
in
opinion
as
to
guilt
or
innocence.
but
beyond
that,
no
jurors
in
anything
more
than
no,
no,
yes
to
the
entire
board
to
your
proceeding.
mr.
jonathan
shapiro
yes.
mr.
jonathan
shapiro
that’s
correct.
mr.
jonathan
shapiro
yes,
its
two
jurors,
that’s
a
typographical
error.
mr.
jonathan
shapiro
the
south
carolina
practice
would
permit
counsel
to
question
the
juror
at
the
judges
discretion,
that
is
--
it’s
permissible
for
the
judge
to
allow
counsel
although
the
usual
practice
is
for
the
judge
to
conduct
the
entire
voir
dire
examination
and
the
more
usual
practice
is
for
the
judge
to
ask
questions
proposed
by
counsel
as
was
done
in
this
case.
mr.
jonathan
shapiro
no,
the
counsel
submitted
written
proposed
voir
dire
questions
to
the
judge
prior
to
the
selection
of
the
jurors
and
when
they
were
refused,
he
sought
no
further
attempt
to
question
the
jurors.
mr.
jonathan
shapiro
i
think
that’s
the
necessary
conclusion
since
the
preferred
practice
in
the
south
carolina
is
for
the
judge
to
put
all
questions
to
the
jury
and
when
counsel
did
request
that
he
do
so
and
that
request
was
denied.
i
think
that
it’s
certainly
reasonable
to
infer
that
any
further
request
would
have
been
fruitful.
mr.
jonathan
shapiro
i
think
that
that
certainly
indicates
the
way
the
judge
would
have
ruled
with
respect
to
the
--
mr.
jonathan
shapiro
exactly.
mr.
jonathan
shapiro
yes
it
does,
he
ruled
that
the
questions
were
irrelevant
and
would
not
put
it
in
way
--
mr.
jonathan
shapiro
the
south
carolina
statute
which
is
set
out
in
the
footnote
3
on
page
5
of
the
brief
states
that
the
court
shall
on
motion
of
either
party
in
this
suit
examined
on
oath,
any
person
who
is
called
to
know
whether
he
is
related
to
either
party,
has
any
interest
in
the
cause,
has
expressed
or
formed
any
opinion
or
a
sensible
of
any
bias
or
prejudice
therein.
and
the
south
carolina
supreme
court
has
interpreted
that
statute
to
be
satisfied
when
questions,
general
questions
has
a
nature
put
to
the
jurors
by
the
trial
judge
are
asked.
mr.
jonathan
shapiro
that’s
correct,
that’s
correct,
although
it
should
be
noted
that
the
judge
did
not
even
fully
comply
with
the
–
all
of
the
requirements
to
that
statute
of
the
three
questions,
the
south
carolina
supreme
court
held
on
appeal
constituted
sufficient
compliance
under
south
carolina
law.
the
refusal
of
the
trial
judge
to
voir
dire
the
jurors
with
respect
to
the
issues
posed
was
raised
on
appeal
on
the
south
carolina
supreme
court
which
affirmed
the
conviction
holding
that
it
was
within
the
discretion
of
the
trial
judge
to
refuse
the
questions
and
that
there
was
no
abuse
of
that
discretion
shown
in
this
case.
two
judges
of
the
south
carolina
supreme
court
has
dissented
on
the
ground
that
this
court’s
decision
in
aldridge
versus
united
states
was
binding
on
the
south
carolina
courts
and
that
the
questions
with
respect
to
racial
prejudice
as
this
court
held
in
aldridge
should
have
been
that.
mr.
jonathan
shapiro
there
are
five
judges.
mr.
jonathan
shapiro
that’s
correct.
we
don’t
understand
the
state
in
this
case
to
question
the
general
proposition
that
a
criminal
defendant
has
a
constitutional
right
to
challenge
for
cause,
jurors
who
are
prejudice
against
him
because
of
race
or
because
of
pretrial
publicity.
the
right
of
challenge
is
a
right
which
we
think
is
a
necessary
component
of
two
independent
constitutional
rights,
the
right
to
a
jury
trial
and
the
right
to
a
trial
before
an
impartial
tribunal.
the
right
to
a
jury
trial
has
included
the
right
challenge
as
long
as
there
have
been
jury
trials.
it’s
a
right
which
developed
at
the
time
the
right
to
a
jury
trial
developed
in
the
first
instance
and
has
never
been
deviated
from
the
either
before
or
after
the
adoption
of
the
united
states
constitution.
what
mr.
justice
powell
said
with
respect
to
unanimity
requirement
in
the
apodaca
case,
we
think
is
equally
if
not
more
true
about
the
right
of
challenge
and
that
is
that,
although
the
history
of
the
sixth
amendment
is
ambiguous
in
the
sense
that
we
don’t
have
the
record
of
the
framers,
the
history
of
the
right
of
challenge
at
common
law
has
been
unambiguous
and
we
think
that
it
has
been
related
to
the
right
to
jury
trial
for
a
time
in
more.
we
think
also
that
the
right
of
challenge
is
essential
to
the
very
function
which
the
jury
is
intended
to
serve
and
that
is
to
provide
an
impartial
barrier
between
the
state
and
the
defendant.
if
there’s
any
one
element
of
the
right
to
jury
trial
which
is
essential,
we
think
it’s
the
impartiality
of
that
body
and
we
think
that
the
right
of
challenge
is
the
only
means
of
successfully
guarantying
that
impartiality.
we
think
also
that
the
right
of
challenge
is
implicit
in
the
right
to
jury
trial
in
this
court’s
decision
in
apodaca
where
the
rationale
for
eliminating
the
unanimity
requirement
is
premised
on
the
defendant’s
ability
to
secure
an
impartial,
responsible
panel
of
jurors
who
will
decide
his
case.
mr.
jonathan
shapiro
no.
mr.
jonathan
shapiro
i
would
think
certainly
not.
i
think
that
most
of
the
questions
and
the
extent
of
a
voir
dire
examination
must
necessarily
rest
in
the
discretion
of
the
trial
judge
for
the
most
part.
here
however,
we’re
confronted
with
the
question
of
whether
any
examination
at
all
with
respect
to
an
issue
which
was
crucial
not
only
to
this
particular
case
but
is
crucial
to
any
case
where
there
is
a
black
criminal
defendant
on
trial
before
an
overwhelmingly
white
jury
and
where
there
has
been
a
certain
amount
of
pretrial
publicity
in
extrajudicial
statements
connected
with
the
case.
mr.
jonathan
shapiro
the
jury
was
10
white
and
two
black
as
finally
in
panel
--
mr.
jonathan
shapiro
it
does,
in
south
carolina
it
does
require
a
unanimous
verdict.
mr.
jonathan
shapiro
yes,
that’s
correct.
mr.
jonathan
shapiro
i
think
that
this
case
involved
two
areas
which
this
court
on
numerous
occasions
has
recognized
or
perhaps
the
most
fundamental
areas
in
dealing
with
impartiality
on
juries
and
that’s
racial
prejudice
and
pretrial
publicity.
we
think
these
areas,
certainly
are
areas
which
are
essential
that
the
trial
judge
examined
jurors
with
respect
to.
there
may
be
other
questions
which
in
other
cases
are
essential
to
selecting
the
impartial
jury
in
the
case
of
morford
versus
united
states,
this
court
held
that
a
trial
judge
was
required
to
examine
prospective
jurors
with
respect
to
whether
a
loyalty
order
would
affect
their
ability
as
government
employees
to
give
the
defendant
who
in
that
case
was
a
communist
who
had
refused
to
testify
before
the
un-american
activities
committee
that
that
inquiry
in
the
circumstances
of
that
case
was
crucial.
mr.
jonathan
shapiro
we
think
that
it
was.
the
court
--
it’s
a
brief
per
curiam
order
but
in
that
decision,
the
court
did
cite
and
refer
to
dennis
versus
united
states
where
the
court
held
that
preservation
of
the
opportunity
to
prove
actual
bias
is
essential
to
the
selection
of
an
impartial
jury
and
we
think
that
that
implicit
in
that
and
reliance
of
the
(inaudible)
court
on
that
is
that
it
was
at
least
with
respect
to
that
federal
case
a
part
of
the
right
to
an
impartial
jury
under
the
sixth
amendment.
mr.
jonathan
shapiro
i
think
that’s
a
fair
statement
of
our
position
which
is
at
in
any,
in
a
given
case,
the
irrelevance
of
the
area
of
inquiry,
proposed
questions
to
issues
and
the
circumstances
of
the
case
are
what
must
be
considered
and
that
when
dealing
with
something
as
fundamental
as
the
issues
in
this
case,
racial
prejudice
and
pretrial
publicity
that
the
judge
cannot
refuse
to
inquiring
to
these
areas.
mr.
jonathan
shapiro
there
was
a
voir
dire
examination
in
the
aldridge
case
which
is
set
out
at
283
u.s.
309
and
that
examination
did
relate
to
the
facts
of
that
particular
case
bias
or
prejudice
of
the
juries
with
respect
to
certain
kind
of
evidence
and
certainly
even
that
examination
was
a
lot
more
extensive
than
the
examination
in
this
case.
the
judge
in
that
case
did
refuse
a
specific
question
with
regard
to
racial
prejudice
and
this
court
held
that
that
refusal
violated
the
essential
demands
of
fairness
under
the
circumstances
of
the
case.
in
addition
to
the
right
of
challenge
resting
on
the
sixth
amendment
right
to
a
jury
trial
as
applied
for
the
states.
we
think
it
also
is
directly
related
to
the
right
to
a
trial
before
an
impartial
body.
we
think
that
the
right
of
challenge
is
crucial
to
selecting
jurors
who
will
not
be
influence
by
passion
or
prejudice
or
extrajudicial
matters.
we
think
it’s
more
essential
even
than
the
right
which
this
court
recognize
in
groppi
versus
wisconsin
to
obtain
of
change
of
venue
in
certain
cases
and
indeed
is
more
basic
to
than
the
right
to
a
cross-section
of
the
community.
because
this
right
is
one
which
can
only
be
satisfied,
the
right
to
an
impartial
jury,
one
can
only
determine
the
partiality
of
jurors
by
questioning
them
specifically
and
exercising
the
right
of
challenge.
the
only
position
the
state
takes
basically
in
this
case
is
that
the
general
questions
that
the
judge
did
put
to
the
jury
and
satisfied
whatever
constitutional
requirements
there
are.
however,
to
conclude
that
we
think
would
make
the
constitutional
requirement
hollow
indeed.
because
the
questions
which
were
asked
did
not
relate
in
any
way
and
did
not
direct
the
juries
attention
in
any
way
to
the
crucial
questions
which
counsel
sought
to
put
to
the
jury.
there
was
no
question
at
all
which
can
even
be
construed
as
asking
the
jurors
whether
they
had
heard
or
had
been
prejudice
by
any
of
the
extrajudicial
statements
or
the
pretrial
publicity
which
had
related
to
the
case.
the
only
question
which
came
--
comes
near
that
is
the
question
as
to
whether
they
had
formed
or
expressed
any
opinion
with
respect
to
the
case
but
it
must
be
recognized
that
at
that
time
when
that
question
was
asked,
the
jurors
knew
nothing
whatsoever
about
the
case.
all
they
knew
was
that
the
defendant’s
name
was
gene
ham.
they
didn’t
know
what
the
nature
of
the
case
was.
they
didn’t
know
what
the
crime
he
was
charged
with
was.
and
they
had
no
idea
of
who
was
going
to
testify
in
the
case
and
as
i
pointed
out
before,
the
chief
prosecution
witness
was
the
person
who
had
appeared
on
local
television
several
days
before
discussing
drug
crimes.
in
that
sense,
the
case
is
very
close
to
turner
versus
louisiana
where
this
court
held
that
the
contact
between
the
jurors
and
prosecution
witnesses
even
without
a
showing
of
actual
bias
or
prejudice
was
enough
to
deny
the
defendant
a
right
to
an
impartial
jury.
the
other
questions
with
respect
to
general
bias
or
prejudice
for
or
against,
we
don’t
think
can
satisfy
the
requirements
of
probing
racial
prejudice.
but
we
think
that
this
court’s
decision
in
aldridge,
in
dennis,
in
morford
indicate
the
specific
inquiries
are
indeed
essential
to
securing
an
impartial
jury.
we
think
it’s
clear
that
when
jurors
are
put
formal
hurried
questions
in
open
court
where
an
immediate
response
is
expected,
they
won’t
volunteer
thing
such
as
whether
or
not
they
are
prejudice
because
of
race.
mr.
jonathan
shapiro
correct,
each
juror
was
called
to
the
--
they
were
all
in
the
box.
the
judge
went
from
one
to
the
other
asking
each.
mr.
jonathan
shapiro
that’s
correct.
so
that
we
think
that
the
general
question
as
put
would
reduce
the
right
of
challenge
and
the
right
of
examination
to
a
hollow
guarantee.
this
court
has
recognized
that
the
jury
is
fundamental
to
american
scheme
of
justice
but
the
jury
will
only
be
able
to
serve
its
high
function
if
the
procedures
are
designed
to
ensure
impartialities
to
the
greatest
extent
of
passing.
because
petitioner
was
deprived
of
the
opportunity
to
secure
the
impartiality
in
this
case,
we
think
his
right
to
an
impartial
jury
was
denied
and
that
is
conviction
should
be
reversed.
mr.
jonathan
shapiro
i
would
like
to
first
address
myself
to
the
point
derived
by
mr.
justice
stewart
with
respect
to
whether
the
issue
was
properly
presented
below.
in
the
briefs
in
the
south
carolina
supreme
court,
the
petitioner
made
the
following
statements.
“the
question
is
a
constitutional
one
of
due
process
of
law
as
for
whether
a
jury
is
prejudice
or
partial
in
the
sense
of
one
of
the
parties
has
denied
a
fair
and
impartial
trial.
it
is
not
a
procedural
one
to
determine
by
statutory
construction
but
one
of
vital
substance
of
law
under
the
constitution.”
that
petitioner
was
referring
to
united
states
constitution
is
made
clear
in
the
following
paragraphs
where
he
continues
and
quotes
irvin
versus
dowd,
sheppard
versus
maxwell
and
irideau
versus
louisiana
for
the
proposition
that
the
refusal
to
ask
the
question
designed
to
insure
the
right
to
an
impartial
trial
is
included
in
this
court
so
pronouncement
in
those
cases.
he
further
continued
and
cited
the
strauder,
georgia
versus
--
mr.
jonathan
shapiro
that
it
was
explicitly
raised
in
this
fashion,
yes
that’s
correct.
we
think
however
under
south
carolina
practice
that
it
was
appropriate
with
the
race
in
the
way
it
was
and
the
assignments
in
there
and
in
the
south
carolina
supreme
court,
and
that
the
fact
that
the
south
carolina
supreme
court
didn’t
explicitly
refer
to
the
constitution
in
its
opinion
does
not
indicate
that
it
wasn’t
presented.
in
fact,
there
were
a
several
constitutional
issues
that
were
presented
as
clearly
as
this
one
which
the
south
carolina
supreme
court
equally
neglected
to,
refer
to
in
its
opinion.
mr.
jonathan
shapiro
frankly,
i
think
it’s
without
rhyme
and
reason,
the
issues
which
the
south
carolina
supreme
court
shows
to
refer
to
in
federal
constitutional
term.
petitioner
also
argued
that
denial
of
his
right
to
a
change
of
venue
expressed,
he
violated
his
right
to
a
fair
impartial
trial
under
the
sixth
and
fourteenth
amendment
yet
the
south
carolina
supreme
court
makes
no
reference
at
all
to
the
federal
constitution
in
disposing
of
that
issue.
so
we
think
that
that
cannot
be
taken
to
mean
that
they
didn’t
consider.
we
think
the
issue
is
whether
it
was
properly
presented
and
we
think
that
under
south
carolina
law
and
it
would.
mr.
jonathan
shapiro
we
think
that
under
south
carolina
law,
the
issue
was
presented
sufficiently
in
this
case
to
present
the
constitutional
issue
in
the
south
carolina
supreme
court.
mr.
jonathan
shapiro
no.
we
think
that
--
mr.
jonathan
shapiro
well,
only
the
south
carolina
decisions
which
we
have
cited
again
in
our
reply
brief
on
certiorari
cases
such
as
state
versus
brown
240
south
carolina
357
126
southeast
2d.
several
other
cases
dealing
with
voir
dire
question.
we
think
indicate
that
under
south
carolina
law
and
this
was
adequately
raised
and
were
appointed
to
no
decision
to
the
contrary.
mr.
jonathan
shapiro
as
a
matter
of
state
law
and
as
a
matter
of
constitution.
i
think
that
when
this
court
looks
to
a
state
supreme
court
decision
if
an
issue
is
properly
raised
under
state
law
with
respect
to
the
federal
issue
that
on
this
court
has
jurisdiction
to
consider
it
regardless
of
whether
the
state
supreme
court
consider
it.
mr.
jonathan
shapiro
we
think
that
the
cases
are
mentioned
to
the
court
indicate
that
under
south
carolina
law,
a
request
that
certain
questions
be
asked
in
order
to
insure
an
impartial
jury
raises
the
question
as
far
as
south
carolina
is
concerned
under
both
state
and
federal
terms
and
no
additional
statement
is
necessary.
mr.
jonathan
shapiro
they
are
cited
in
our
reply
brief
on
the
cert
petition.
mr.
jonathan
shapiro
well,
we
think
that
it
certainly
has
constitutional
dimension.
the
court
certainly
did
not
explicitly
refer
the
constitution.
it
did
however
deal
with
the
issue
in
terms
of
the
“essential
demands
of
fairness.”
mr.
jonathan
shapiro
it
dealt
with
a
case
coming
up
under
that.
mr.
jonathan
shapiro
right.
but
i
don’t
think
that
the
issue
was
a
statutory
one.
i
think
the
statute
dealt
with
the
mode
by
which
this
court
could
review
the
decision
but
as
far
as
the
issue
of
whether
the
particular
question
should
have
been
asked
was
--
mr.
jonathan
shapiro
i
think
so,
and
i
think
that
this
court
indicated
it
as
much
in
swain
versus
alabama
where
the
court
stated
that
the
fairness
of
trial
by
jury
requires
that
the
influence
of
race
on
jurors
be
explored.
mr.
jonathan
shapiro
the
newspaper
articles
as
far
as
i
know
are
not
in
the
trial
record.
as
--
mr.
jonathan
shapiro
i
think
that
the
issue
which
we’re
not
posing
is
not
--
that
we’re
posing
is
not
whether
or
not
there
was
such
a
pretrial
publicity
as
to
deny
a
fair
trial.
we’re
rather
suggesting
that
where
there
has
been
pretrial
publicity
that
the
duty
of
the
trial
judge
is
at
least
to
inquire
whether
jurors
have
been
prejudice.
now
in
the
case
where
there
--
mr.
jonathan
shapiro
not
necessarily,
we
think
that
for
example
a
juror
might
be
prejudice
by
publicity
which
didn’t
rise
to
the
--
to
such
as
would
--
under
to
this
court’s
decision
that
deprived
him
of
a
fair
trial
if
that
juror
has
said.
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
if
the
juror
was
exposed,
he
might
have
been
prejudice.
mr.
jonathan
shapiro
the
newspaper
articles
as
counsel
pointed
out
into
the
trial
judge
dealt
extensively
with
the
problems
relating
to
drug
crimes
--
mr.
jonathan
shapiro
well
only
from
counsel
statement
that
--
mr.
jonathan
shapiro
well
i
think
counsel
only
referred
to
the
fact
that
--
mr.
jonathan
shapiro
and
the
question
--
mr.
jonathan
shapiro
the
question
on
page
36
--
mr.
jonathan
shapiro
have
you
--
that
he
requested
that
the
judge
asked
stated,
have
you
heard
or
read
about
recent
newspaper
articles
to
the
effect
that
the
local
drug
problem
--
mr.
jonathan
shapiro
it’s
on
page
36
of
the
appendix
in
--
mr.
jonathan
shapiro
proposed
question
number
4.
mr.
jonathan
shapiro
that’s
correct.
mr.
jonathan
shapiro
they’re
not
in
the
record.
mr.
jonathan
shapiro
well,
i
don’t
think
that
it’s
any
good
at
this
point.
mr.
jonathan
shapiro
because
our
position
is
not
that
there
was
such
prejudicial
publicity
as
to
deny
him
a
fair
trial
but
rather
in
view
of
the
showing
--
mr.
jonathan
shapiro
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
that
shows
that
there
was
any
publicity
about
this
specific
case.
mr.
jonathan
shapiro
i
think
that
page
12
indicates
that
the
clippings
that
the
counsel
handed
to
the
judge
dealt
with
drug
crimes
in
florence
county.
mr.
jonathan
shapiro
i
think
that
if
you
read
the
proposed
question
on
page
36
in
light
of
that
submission
of
the
question,
it
indicates
that
the
newspaper
articles
related
to
the
fact
that
the
local
drug
problem
is
bagged
in
the
words
of
counsel.
mr.
jonathan
shapiro
no.
mr.
jonathan
shapiro
we’re
suggesting
that
this
was
a
sufficient
showing
to
at
least
require
the
judge
to
ask
whether
the
juror
might
have
been
prejudice
because
of
this.
mr.
jonathan
shapiro
i
think
that
he
had
been
presented
with
articles
which
the
jurors
could
have
read.
but
we
think
even
more
significant
on
the
extrajudicial
publicity
is
the
fact
that
the
chief
prosecution
witness
had
testified
extensively
on
a
local
television
program
several
days
before
the
trial.
mr.
jonathan
shapiro
well
this
is
again
on
page
36
proposed
question
number
4
which
--
mr.
jonathan
shapiro
we
think
that
that
sufficient
showing
that
there
was
in
fact
such
a
television
program
and
that
the
chief
witness
did
in
fact
testify.
of
courts,
the
judge
refused
to
ask
the
question
without
any
determination
as
to
whether
in
fact
there
had
been
such
a
television
program
or
not.
and
we
think
that
the
way
you
--
in
case
comes
up
it’s
implicit
that
he
assumed
that
there
was
a
program
and
in
fact
he
said
that
the
question
was
irrelevant.
mr.
jonathan
shapiro
well,
of
course
the
newspaper
articles
didn’t
relate
to
this
television
program
and
we
think
again
that
it
must
be
remembered
that
this
motion
was
--
and
his
questions
were
posed
the
day
after
petitioner
was
indicted.
counsel
had
no
opportunity
to
prepare
a
form
of
motion
to
collect
the
newspaper
clippings
to
make
a
full
presentation
as
to
the
extent
of
possible
publicity.
he
was
forced
to
go
to
trial
over
his
objection
on
the
very
next
day
after
the
indictment
was
returned
and
we
think
especially
in
light
of
that
unseemly
haste
that
it
was
more
than
necessary
to
have
the
jurors
examine
with
respect
to
the
issues
he
raised.
mr.
jonathan
shapiro
i
think
it’s
--
it
can
be
assumed
that
--
mr.
jonathan
shapiro
they
are
not
here
and
i
think
that
they
were
not
the
only
clippings.
well,
of
course
i
can’t
state
that
as
a
fact.
the
fact
to
the
matter
is
counsel
wasn’t
prepared
to
go
to
trial
in
the
day
after
indictment.
he
hadn’t
been
able
to
prepare
a
motion
which
could
have
set
forth.
all
of
the
clippings,
all
of
the
parameters
of
the
publicity
and
especially
in
light
of
that,
we
think
that
it
was
more
than
usually
necessary
to
explore
the
potential
for
prejudice
on
the
members
of
the
jury.
mr.
jonathan
shapiro
that’s
right.
the
fourth
question
which
of
course
--
mr.
jonathan
shapiro
that
is
correct.
mr.
jonathan
shapiro
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
certiorari
to
a
decision
of
the
south
carolina
supreme
court
affirming
petitioner’s
conviction
and
sentenced
to
one-and-a-half
years
of
hard
labor
for
the
possession
of
marijuana.
the
certiorari
grant
was
limited
to
the
issue
of
whether
a
black
criminal
defendant
is
constitutionally
entitled
to
any
opportunity
to
examine
prospective
jurors
on
voir
dire
with
respect
to
whether
they
are
prejudice
against
him
because
of
his
race
or
because
of
certain
pretrial
publicity
in
the
case.
thus,
this
case
raises
for
the
first
time
in
this
court
as
a
question
of
the
right
of
a
criminal
defendant
to
examine
and
to
challenge
for
cause
a
jurors
who
are
called
to
decide
his
case.
we
think
that
that
right
is
a
part
of
the
constitutional
right
to
a
jury
trial
and
that
in
this
case
it
was
violated.
the
petitioner
is
a
black
civil
rights
worker
who
has
been
active
in
the
county
of
florence
in
south
carolina
as
a
representative
of
sclc,
as
well
as
at
the
time
a
member
of
the
bi-racial
commission
of
the
city
of
florence.
he
was
indicted
on
june
1,
1970
for
the
crime
of
possession
of
marijuana.
his
defense
in
the
case
into
trial
of
the
case
at
which
he
testified
was
that
the
charge
against
him
was
a
result
of
complicity
by
the
local
police
authorities
to
frame
him
because
of
his
civil
rights
activities.
over
his
objection,
the
trial
was
commenced
on
the
day
after
indictment
that
is
on
june
2nd.
although
petitioner,
his
counsel
sought
to
make
motions
for
a
change
of
venue
and
for
a
continuance
on
the
basis
of
pretrial
publicity
and
possible
prejudice
on
the
part
of
the
prospective
jurors,
he
was
unable
to
do
so
in
sworn
affidavits
as
required
under
south
carolina
law
and
rather
was
forced
to
make
the
request
orally
to
the
court
which
overruled
both
motions
summarily.
he
made
similarly
an
oral
motion
to
quash
the
trial
venire
on
the
grounds
that
blacks
had
been
systematically
excluded
and
after
a
hearing
on
the
june
2nd,
the
court
denied
that
motion.
on
the
next
day,
prior
to
the
selection
of
the
jury,
a
petitioner
requested
the
trial
judge
to
voir
dire
the
prospective
jurors
with
respect
to
several
matters
relating
to
whether
they
were
prejudiced
against
him
because
he
was
black
and
because
of
certain
pretrial
publicity
in
extrajudicial
statements
in
the
case.
specifically,
he
requested
that
each
prospective
juror
be
asked
whether
he
or
she
was
prejudiced
against
negroes,
whether
the
fact
that
the
defendant
was
black
would
affect
his
or
her
ability
to
render
an
impartial
judgment
and
verdict
in
the
case.
whether
the
fact
that
the
petitioner
was
bearded
would
make
any
difference
in
the
way
they
decided
the
case.
in
addition,
he
specifically
requested
that
the
trial
judge
asked
the
jurors
about
certain
publicity
which
he
claimed
had
poisoned
the
minds
of
--
or
possibly
poisoned
the
minds
of
persons
in
that
county
with
respect
to
persons
charged
with
the
crime
which
the
petitioner
was
charged
with,
and
also
with
respect
to
whether
any
of
them
had
heard
a
television
program
several
days
before
the
trial
at
which
the
state’s
chief
prosecution
witness
had
appeared
and
had
talked
extensively
in
connection
with
drug
crimes.
the
trial
judge
refused
to
ask
any
of
the
proposed
questions
on
the
grounds
that
they
were
irrelevant.
instead,
he
posed
three
questions
to
the
perspective
jurors.
he
asked
them
whether
any
of
them
had
formed
or
expressed
an
opinion
as
to
guilt
or
innocence
of
the
petitioner
whether
any
of
them
was
sensible
of
any
bias
or
prejudice
for
or
against
him
and
whether
each
of
them
could
give
the
state
and
the
defendant
a
fair
trial.
the
entire
examination
of
the
prospective
jurors
in
this
case
took
a
total
of
12
pages
of
the
record.
it
was
hurried,
formalistic
and
routine.
each
juror
as
he
was
called
and
sworn
was
put,
the
exact
same
question
by
the
trial
judge.
each
juror
with
two
exceptions
answered
the
questions,
the
first
two
question
no
and
the
third
question
yes.
no
further
examination
was
gone
into
in
any
case.
the
only
two
exceptions
was
one
juror
who
answered
the
first
two
questions
no,
but
in
response
to
the
third
question
said
that
she
was
rather
not
cert.
one
juror
said
that
she
had
a
formed
or
expressed
in
opinion
as
to
guilt
or
innocence.
but
beyond
that,
no
jurors
in
anything
more
than
no,
no,
yes
to
the
entire
board
to
your
proceeding.
mr.
jonathan
shapiro
yes.
mr.
jonathan
shapiro
that’s
correct.
mr.
jonathan
shapiro
yes,
its
two
jurors,
that’s
a
typographical
error.
mr.
jonathan
shapiro
the
south
carolina
practice
would
permit
counsel
to
question
the
juror
at
the
judges
discretion,
that
is
--
it’s
permissible
for
the
judge
to
allow
counsel
although
the
usual
practice
is
for
the
judge
to
conduct
the
entire
voir
dire
examination
and
the
more
usual
practice
is
for
the
judge
to
ask
questions
proposed
by
counsel
as
was
done
in
this
case.
mr.
jonathan
shapiro
no,
the
counsel
submitted
written
proposed
voir
dire
questions
to
the
judge
prior
to
the
selection
of
the
jurors
and
when
they
were
refused,
he
sought
no
further
attempt
to
question
the
jurors.
mr.
jonathan
shapiro
i
think
that’s
the
necessary
conclusion
since
the
preferred
practice
in
the
south
carolina
is
for
the
judge
to
put
all
questions
to
the
jury
and
when
counsel
did
request
that
he
do
so
and
that
request
was
denied.
i
think
that
it’s
certainly
reasonable
to
infer
that
any
further
request
would
have
been
fruitful.
mr.
jonathan
shapiro
i
think
that
that
certainly
indicates
the
way
the
judge
would
have
ruled
with
respect
to
the
--
mr.
jonathan
shapiro
exactly.
mr.
jonathan
shapiro
yes
it
does,
he
ruled
that
the
questions
were
irrelevant
and
would
not
put
it
in
way
--
mr.
jonathan
shapiro
the
south
carolina
statute
which
is
set
out
in
the
footnote
3
on
page
5
of
the
brief
states
that
the
court
shall
on
motion
of
either
party
in
this
suit
examined
on
oath,
any
person
who
is
called
to
know
whether
he
is
related
to
either
party,
has
any
interest
in
the
cause,
has
expressed
or
formed
any
opinion
or
a
sensible
of
any
bias
or
prejudice
therein.
and
the
south
carolina
supreme
court
has
interpreted
that
statute
to
be
satisfied
when
questions,
general
questions
has
a
nature
put
to
the
jurors
by
the
trial
judge
are
asked.
mr.
jonathan
shapiro
that’s
correct,
that’s
correct,
although
it
should
be
noted
that
the
judge
did
not
even
fully
comply
with
the
–
all
of
the
requirements
to
that
statute
of
the
three
questions,
the
south
carolina
supreme
court
held
on
appeal
constituted
sufficient
compliance
under
south
carolina
law.
the
refusal
of
the
trial
judge
to
voir
dire
the
jurors
with
respect
to
the
issues
posed
was
raised
on
appeal
on
the
south
carolina
supreme
court
which
affirmed
the
conviction
holding
that
it
was
within
the
discretion
of
the
trial
judge
to
refuse
the
questions
and
that
there
was
no
abuse
of
that
discretion
shown
in
this
case.
two
judges
of
the
south
carolina
supreme
court
has
dissented
on
the
ground
that
this
court’s
decision
in
aldridge
versus
united
states
was
binding
on
the
south
carolina
courts
and
that
the
questions
with
respect
to
racial
prejudice
as
this
court
held
in
aldridge
should
have
been
that.
mr.
jonathan
shapiro
there
are
five
judges.
mr.
jonathan
shapiro
that’s
correct.
we
don’t
understand
the
state
in
this
case
to
question
the
general
proposition
that
a
criminal
defendant
has
a
constitutional
right
to
challenge
for
cause,
jurors
who
are
prejudice
against
him
because
of
race
or
because
of
pretrial
publicity.
the
right
of
challenge
is
a
right
which
we
think
is
a
necessary
component
of
two
independent
constitutional
rights,
the
right
to
a
jury
trial
and
the
right
to
a
trial
before
an
impartial
tribunal.
the
right
to
a
jury
trial
has
included
the
right
challenge
as
long
as
there
have
been
jury
trials.
it’s
a
right
which
developed
at
the
time
the
right
to
a
jury
trial
developed
in
the
first
instance
and
has
never
been
deviated
from
the
either
before
or
after
the
adoption
of
the
united
states
constitution.
what
mr.
justice
powell
said
with
respect
to
unanimity
requirement
in
the
apodaca
case,
we
think
is
equally
if
not
more
true
about
the
right
of
challenge
and
that
is
that,
although
the
history
of
the
sixth
amendment
is
ambiguous
in
the
sense
that
we
don’t
have
the
record
of
the
framers,
the
history
of
the
right
of
challenge
at
common
law
has
been
unambiguous
and
we
think
that
it
has
been
related
to
the
right
to
jury
trial
for
a
time
in
more.
we
think
also
that
the
right
of
challenge
is
essential
to
the
very
function
which
the
jury
is
intended
to
serve
and
that
is
to
provide
an
impartial
barrier
between
the
state
and
the
defendant.
if
there’s
any
one
element
of
the
right
to
jury
trial
which
is
essential,
we
think
it’s
the
impartiality
of
that
body
and
we
think
that
the
right
of
challenge
is
the
only
means
of
successfully
guarantying
that
impartiality.
we
think
also
that
the
right
of
challenge
is
implicit
in
the
right
to
jury
trial
in
this
court’s
decision
in
apodaca
where
the
rationale
for
eliminating
the
unanimity
requirement
is
premised
on
the
defendant’s
ability
to
secure
an
impartial,
responsible
panel
of
jurors
who
will
decide
his
case.
mr.
jonathan
shapiro
no.
mr.
jonathan
shapiro
i
would
think
certainly
not.
i
think
that
most
of
the
questions
and
the
extent
of
a
voir
dire
examination
must
necessarily
rest
in
the
discretion
of
the
trial
judge
for
the
most
part.
here
however,
we’re
confronted
with
the
question
of
whether
any
examination
at
all
with
respect
to
an
issue
which
was
crucial
not
only
to
this
particular
case
but
is
crucial
to
any
case
where
there
is
a
black
criminal
defendant
on
trial
before
an
overwhelmingly
white
jury
and
where
there
has
been
a
certain
amount
of
pretrial
publicity
in
extrajudicial
statements
connected
with
the
case.
mr.
jonathan
shapiro
the
jury
was
10
white
and
two
black
as
finally
in
panel
--
mr.
jonathan
shapiro
it
does,
in
south
carolina
it
does
require
a
unanimous
verdict.
mr.
jonathan
shapiro
yes,
that’s
correct.
mr.
jonathan
shapiro
i
think
that
this
case
involved
two
areas
which
this
court
on
numerous
occasions
has
recognized
or
perhaps
the
most
fundamental
areas
in
dealing
with
impartiality
on
juries
and
that’s
racial
prejudice
and
pretrial
publicity.
we
think
these
areas,
certainly
are
areas
which
are
essential
that
the
trial
judge
examined
jurors
with
respect
to.
there
may
be
other
questions
which
in
other
cases
are
essential
to
selecting
the
impartial
jury
in
the
case
of
morford
versus
united
states,
this
court
held
that
a
trial
judge
was
required
to
examine
prospective
jurors
with
respect
to
whether
a
loyalty
order
would
affect
their
ability
as
government
employees
to
give
the
defendant
who
in
that
case
was
a
communist
who
had
refused
to
testify
before
the
un-american
activities
committee
that
that
inquiry
in
the
circumstances
of
that
case
was
crucial.
mr.
jonathan
shapiro
we
think
that
it
was.
the
court
--
it’s
a
brief
per
curiam
order
but
in
that
decision,
the
court
did
cite
and
refer
to
dennis
versus
united
states
where
the
court
held
that
preservation
of
the
opportunity
to
prove
actual
bias
is
essential
to
the
selection
of
an
impartial
jury
and
we
think
that
that
implicit
in
that
and
reliance
of
the
(inaudible)
court
on
that
is
that
it
was
at
least
with
respect
to
that
federal
case
a
part
of
the
right
to
an
impartial
jury
under
the
sixth
amendment.
mr.
jonathan
shapiro
i
think
that’s
a
fair
statement
of
our
position
which
is
at
in
any,
in
a
given
case,
the
irrelevance
of
the
area
of
inquiry,
proposed
questions
to
issues
and
the
circumstances
of
the
case
are
what
must
be
considered
and
that
when
dealing
with
something
as
fundamental
as
the
issues
in
this
case,
racial
prejudice
and
pretrial
publicity
that
the
judge
cannot
refuse
to
inquiring
to
these
areas.
mr.
jonathan
shapiro
there
was
a
voir
dire
examination
in
the
aldridge
case
which
is
set
out
at
283
u.s.
309
and
that
examination
did
relate
to
the
facts
of
that
particular
case
bias
or
prejudice
of
the
juries
with
respect
to
certain
kind
of
evidence
and
certainly
even
that
examination
was
a
lot
more
extensive
than
the
examination
in
this
case.
the
judge
in
that
case
did
refuse
a
specific
question
with
regard
to
racial
prejudice
and
this
court
held
that
that
refusal
violated
the
essential
demands
of
fairness
under
the
circumstances
of
the
case.
in
addition
to
the
right
of
challenge
resting
on
the
sixth
amendment
right
to
a
jury
trial
as
applied
for
the
states.
we
think
it
also
is
directly
related
to
the
right
to
a
trial
before
an
impartial
body.
we
think
that
the
right
of
challenge
is
crucial
to
selecting
jurors
who
will
not
be
influence
by
passion
or
prejudice
or
extrajudicial
matters.
we
think
it’s
more
essential
even
than
the
right
which
this
court
recognize
in
groppi
versus
wisconsin
to
obtain
of
change
of
venue
in
certain
cases
and
indeed
is
more
basic
to
than
the
right
to
a
cross-section
of
the
community.
because
this
right
is
one
which
can
only
be
satisfied,
the
right
to
an
impartial
jury,
one
can
only
determine
the
partiality
of
jurors
by
questioning
them
specifically
and
exercising
the
right
of
challenge.
the
only
position
the
state
takes
basically
in
this
case
is
that
the
general
questions
that
the
judge
did
put
to
the
jury
and
satisfied
whatever
constitutional
requirements
there
are.
however,
to
conclude
that
we
think
would
make
the
constitutional
requirement
hollow
indeed.
because
the
questions
which
were
asked
did
not
relate
in
any
way
and
did
not
direct
the
juries
attention
in
any
way
to
the
crucial
questions
which
counsel
sought
to
put
to
the
jury.
there
was
no
question
at
all
which
can
even
be
construed
as
asking
the
jurors
whether
they
had
heard
or
had
been
prejudice
by
any
of
the
extrajudicial
statements
or
the
pretrial
publicity
which
had
related
to
the
case.
the
only
question
which
came
--
comes
near
that
is
the
question
as
to
whether
they
had
formed
or
expressed
any
opinion
with
respect
to
the
case
but
it
must
be
recognized
that
at
that
time
when
that
question
was
asked,
the
jurors
knew
nothing
whatsoever
about
the
case.
all
they
knew
was
that
the
defendant’s
name
was
gene
ham.
they
didn’t
know
what
the
nature
of
the
case
was.
they
didn’t
know
what
the
crime
he
was
charged
with
was.
and
they
had
no
idea
of
who
was
going
to
testify
in
the
case
and
as
i
pointed
out
before,
the
chief
prosecution
witness
was
the
person
who
had
appeared
on
local
television
several
days
before
discussing
drug
crimes.
in
that
sense,
the
case
is
very
close
to
turner
versus
louisiana
where
this
court
held
that
the
contact
between
the
jurors
and
prosecution
witnesses
even
without
a
showing
of
actual
bias
or
prejudice
was
enough
to
deny
the
defendant
a
right
to
an
impartial
jury.
the
other
questions
with
respect
to
general
bias
or
prejudice
for
or
against,
we
don’t
think
can
satisfy
the
requirements
of
probing
racial
prejudice.
but
we
think
that
this
court’s
decision
in
aldridge,
in
dennis,
in
morford
indicate
the
specific
inquiries
are
indeed
essential
to
securing
an
impartial
jury.
we
think
it’s
clear
that
when
jurors
are
put
formal
hurried
questions
in
open
court
where
an
immediate
response
is
expected,
they
won’t
volunteer
thing
such
as
whether
or
not
they
are
prejudice
because
of
race.
mr.
jonathan
shapiro
correct,
each
juror
was
called
to
the
--
they
were
all
in
the
box.
the
judge
went
from
one
to
the
other
asking
each.
mr.
jonathan
shapiro
that’s
correct.
so
that
we
think
that
the
general
question
as
put
would
reduce
the
right
of
challenge
and
the
right
of
examination
to
a
hollow
guarantee.
this
court
has
recognized
that
the
jury
is
fundamental
to
american
scheme
of
justice
but
the
jury
will
only
be
able
to
serve
its
high
function
if
the
procedures
are
designed
to
ensure
impartialities
to
the
greatest
extent
of
passing.
because
petitioner
was
deprived
of
the
opportunity
to
secure
the
impartiality
in
this
case,
we
think
his
right
to
an
impartial
jury
was
denied
and
that
is
conviction
should
be
reversed.
mr.
jonathan
shapiro
i
would
like
to
first
address
myself
to
the
point
derived
by
mr.
justice
stewart
with
respect
to
whether
the
issue
was
properly
presented
below.
in
the
briefs
in
the
south
carolina
supreme
court,
the
petitioner
made
the
following
statements.
“the
question
is
a
constitutional
one
of
due
process
of
law
as
for
whether
a
jury
is
prejudice
or
partial
in
the
sense
of
one
of
the
parties
has
denied
a
fair
and
impartial
trial.
it
is
not
a
procedural
one
to
determine
by
statutory
construction
but
one
of
vital
substance
of
law
under
the
constitution.”
that
petitioner
was
referring
to
united
states
constitution
is
made
clear
in
the
following
paragraphs
where
he
continues
and
quotes
irvin
versus
dowd,
sheppard
versus
maxwell
and
irideau
versus
louisiana
for
the
proposition
that
the
refusal
to
ask
the
question
designed
to
insure
the
right
to
an
impartial
trial
is
included
in
this
court
so
pronouncement
in
those
cases.
he
further
continued
and
cited
the
strauder,
georgia
versus
--
mr.
jonathan
shapiro
that
it
was
explicitly
raised
in
this
fashion,
yes
that’s
correct.
we
think
however
under
south
carolina
practice
that
it
was
appropriate
with
the
race
in
the
way
it
was
and
the
assignments
in
there
and
in
the
south
carolina
supreme
court,
and
that
the
fact
that
the
south
carolina
supreme
court
didn’t
explicitly
refer
to
the
constitution
in
its
opinion
does
not
indicate
that
it
wasn’t
presented.
in
fact,
there
were
a
several
constitutional
issues
that
were
presented
as
clearly
as
this
one
which
the
south
carolina
supreme
court
equally
neglected
to,
refer
to
in
its
opinion.
mr.
jonathan
shapiro
frankly,
i
think
it’s
without
rhyme
and
reason,
the
issues
which
the
south
carolina
supreme
court
shows
to
refer
to
in
federal
constitutional
term.
petitioner
also
argued
that
denial
of
his
right
to
a
change
of
venue
expressed,
he
violated
his
right
to
a
fair
impartial
trial
under
the
sixth
and
fourteenth
amendment
yet
the
south
carolina
supreme
court
makes
no
reference
at
all
to
the
federal
constitution
in
disposing
of
that
issue.
so
we
think
that
that
cannot
be
taken
to
mean
that
they
didn’t
consider.
we
think
the
issue
is
whether
it
was
properly
presented
and
we
think
that
under
south
carolina
law
and
it
would.
mr.
jonathan
shapiro
we
think
that
under
south
carolina
law,
the
issue
was
presented
sufficiently
in
this
case
to
present
the
constitutional
issue
in
the
south
carolina
supreme
court.
mr.
jonathan
shapiro
no.
we
think
that
--
mr.
jonathan
shapiro
well,
only
the
south
carolina
decisions
which
we
have
cited
again
in
our
reply
brief
on
certiorari
cases
such
as
state
versus
brown
240
south
carolina
357
126
southeast
2d.
several
other
cases
dealing
with
voir
dire
question.
we
think
indicate
that
under
south
carolina
law
and
this
was
adequately
raised
and
were
appointed
to
no
decision
to
the
contrary.
mr.
jonathan
shapiro
as
a
matter
of
state
law
and
as
a
matter
of
constitution.
i
think
that
when
this
court
looks
to
a
state
supreme
court
decision
if
an
issue
is
properly
raised
under
state
law
with
respect
to
the
federal
issue
that
on
this
court
has
jurisdiction
to
consider
it
regardless
of
whether
the
state
supreme
court
consider
it.
mr.
jonathan
shapiro
we
think
that
the
cases
are
mentioned
to
the
court
indicate
that
under
south
carolina
law,
a
request
that
certain
questions
be
asked
in
order
to
insure
an
impartial
jury
raises
the
question
as
far
as
south
carolina
is
concerned
under
both
state
and
federal
terms
and
no
additional
statement
is
necessary.
mr.
jonathan
shapiro
they
are
cited
in
our
reply
brief
on
the
cert
petition.
mr.
jonathan
shapiro
well,
we
think
that
it
certainly
has
constitutional
dimension.
the
court
certainly
did
not
explicitly
refer
the
constitution.
it
did
however
deal
with
the
issue
in
terms
of
the
“essential
demands
of
fairness.”
mr.
jonathan
shapiro
it
dealt
with
a
case
coming
up
under
that.
mr.
jonathan
shapiro
right.
but
i
don’t
think
that
the
issue
was
a
statutory
one.
i
think
the
statute
dealt
with
the
mode
by
which
this
court
could
review
the
decision
but
as
far
as
the
issue
of
whether
the
particular
question
should
have
been
asked
was
--
mr.
jonathan
shapiro
i
think
so,
and
i
think
that
this
court
indicated
it
as
much
in
swain
versus
alabama
where
the
court
stated
that
the
fairness
of
trial
by
jury
requires
that
the
influence
of
race
on
jurors
be
explored.
mr.
jonathan
shapiro
the
newspaper
articles
as
far
as
i
know
are
not
in
the
trial
record.
as
--
mr.
jonathan
shapiro
i
think
that
the
issue
which
we’re
not
posing
is
not
--
that
we’re
posing
is
not
whether
or
not
there
was
such
a
pretrial
publicity
as
to
deny
a
fair
trial.
we’re
rather
suggesting
that
where
there
has
been
pretrial
publicity
that
the
duty
of
the
trial
judge
is
at
least
to
inquire
whether
jurors
have
been
prejudice.
now
in
the
case
where
there
--
mr.
jonathan
shapiro
not
necessarily,
we
think
that
for
example
a
juror
might
be
prejudice
by
publicity
which
didn’t
rise
to
the
--
to
such
as
would
--
under
to
this
court’s
decision
that
deprived
him
of
a
fair
trial
if
that
juror
has
said.
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
if
the
juror
was
exposed,
he
might
have
been
prejudice.
mr.
jonathan
shapiro
the
newspaper
articles
as
counsel
pointed
out
into
the
trial
judge
dealt
extensively
with
the
problems
relating
to
drug
crimes
--
mr.
jonathan
shapiro
well
only
from
counsel
statement
that
--
mr.
jonathan
shapiro
well
i
think
counsel
only
referred
to
the
fact
that
--
mr.
jonathan
shapiro
and
the
question
--
mr.
jonathan
shapiro
the
question
on
page
36
--
mr.
jonathan
shapiro
have
you
--
that
he
requested
that
the
judge
asked
stated,
have
you
heard
or
read
about
recent
newspaper
articles
to
the
effect
that
the
local
drug
problem
--
mr.
jonathan
shapiro
it’s
on
page
36
of
the
appendix
in
--
mr.
jonathan
shapiro
proposed
question
number
4.
mr.
jonathan
shapiro
that’s
correct.
mr.
jonathan
shapiro
they’re
not
in
the
record.
mr.
jonathan
shapiro
well,
i
don’t
think
that
it’s
any
good
at
this
point.
mr.
jonathan
shapiro
because
our
position
is
not
that
there
was
such
prejudicial
publicity
as
to
deny
him
a
fair
trial
but
rather
in
view
of
the
showing
--
mr.
jonathan
shapiro
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
that
shows
that
there
was
any
publicity
about
this
specific
case.
mr.
jonathan
shapiro
i
think
that
page
12
indicates
that
the
clippings
that
the
counsel
handed
to
the
judge
dealt
with
drug
crimes
in
florence
county.
mr.
jonathan
shapiro
i
think
that
if
you
read
the
proposed
question
on
page
36
in
light
of
that
submission
of
the
question,
it
indicates
that
the
newspaper
articles
related
to
the
fact
that
the
local
drug
problem
is
bagged
in
the
words
of
counsel.
mr.
jonathan
shapiro
no.
mr.
jonathan
shapiro
we’re
suggesting
that
this
was
a
sufficient
showing
to
at
least
require
the
judge
to
ask
whether
the
juror
might
have
been
prejudice
because
of
this.
mr.
jonathan
shapiro
i
think
that
he
had
been
presented
with
articles
which
the
jurors
could
have
read.
but
we
think
even
more
significant
on
the
extrajudicial
publicity
is
the
fact
that
the
chief
prosecution
witness
had
testified
extensively
on
a
local
television
program
several
days
before
the
trial.
mr.
jonathan
shapiro
well
this
is
again
on
page
36
proposed
question
number
4
which
--
mr.
jonathan
shapiro
we
think
that
that
sufficient
showing
that
there
was
in
fact
such
a
television
program
and
that
the
chief
witness
did
in
fact
testify.
of
courts,
the
judge
refused
to
ask
the
question
without
any
determination
as
to
whether
in
fact
there
had
been
such
a
television
program
or
not.
and
we
think
that
the
way
you
--
in
case
comes
up
it’s
implicit
that
he
assumed
that
there
was
a
program
and
in
fact
he
said
that
the
question
was
irrelevant.
mr.
jonathan
shapiro
well,
of
course
the
newspaper
articles
didn’t
relate
to
this
television
program
and
we
think
again
that
it
must
be
remembered
that
this
motion
was
--
and
his
questions
were
posed
the
day
after
petitioner
was
indicted.
counsel
had
no
opportunity
to
prepare
a
form
of
motion
to
collect
the
newspaper
clippings
to
make
a
full
presentation
as
to
the
extent
of
possible
publicity.
he
was
forced
to
go
to
trial
over
his
objection
on
the
very
next
day
after
the
indictment
was
returned
and
we
think
especially
in
light
of
that
unseemly
haste
that
it
was
more
than
necessary
to
have
the
jurors
examine
with
respect
to
the
issues
he
raised.
mr.
jonathan
shapiro
i
think
it’s
--
it
can
be
assumed
that
--
mr.
jonathan
shapiro
they
are
not
here
and
i
think
that
they
were
not
the
only
clippings.
well,
of
course
i
can’t
state
that
as
a
fact.
the
fact
to
the
matter
is
counsel
wasn’t
prepared
to
go
to
trial
in
the
day
after
indictment.
he
hadn’t
been
able
to
prepare
a
motion
which
could
have
set
forth.
all
of
the
clippings,
all
of
the
parameters
of
the
publicity
and
especially
in
light
of
that,
we
think
that
it
was
more
than
usually
necessary
to
explore
the
potential
for
prejudice
on
the
members
of
the
jury.
mr.
jonathan
shapiro
that’s
right.
the
fourth
question
which
of
course
--
mr.
jonathan
shapiro
that
is
correct.
