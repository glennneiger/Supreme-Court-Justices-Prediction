mr.
timothy
g.
quinn
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
facts
of
this
case
having
been
presented
in
the
appendix,
i
will
not
reiterate
them
with
the
permission
of
the
court.
it
basically
appeared
to
be
two
issues
involved.
first,
did
the
trial
judges
refusal
a
prejudicial
pretrial
publicity
or
questioning
as
to
prejudicial
pretrial
publicity
on
the
examination
of
the
jurors
through
the
voir
dire,
violate
their
ability
to
render
a
fair
verdict?
there’s
no
question
to
that
pretrial
publicity
is
a
proper
subject
for
questioning
on
voir
dire.
if
there
is
a
showing
that
pretrial
publicity
did
exist
that
the
pretrial
publicity
did
refer
to
the
petitioner
that
the
pretrial
publicity
was
prejudicial.
in
this
case,
there
was
no
such
showing.
there
was
no
pretrial
publicity
which
referred
directly
to
the
petitioner.
there
was
no
pretrial
publicity
which
is
prejudicial
nor
was
any
pretrial
publicity
other
than
general
publicity
regarding
the
drug
problem
in
the
state
of
south
carolina,
county
of
florence
which
we
contend
there
is
no
--
i
mean
in
newspaper
in
the
state
today
that
you
cannot
pick
up
with
that
finding,
some
allegations
as
to
drug
use
or
drug
abuse.
the
facts
in
this
case
reveal
that
the
pretrial
publicity
alleged
to
be
prejudicial
consisted
of
three
articles
in
the
same
newspaper
published
on
the
same
date.
none
of
which
referred
to
the
petitioner
and
all
were
dealing
only
generally
with
the
drug
problem.

mr.
timothy
g.
quinn
at
the
top
of
this
page
it
states
the
clippings,
appearing
in
florence,
morning
news.
under
these
circumstances
we
contend
that
there
was
no
abuse
and
discretion
on
the
part
of
the
trial
judge
in
refusing
to
ask
these
specific
questions
in
sought.
perhaps
at
some
basis
or
even
conjecture
and
that’s
specific
prejudicial
items
might
have
reached
the
venire.
we
contended
it
was
wiser
for
the
trial
judge
to
phrase
before
the
examination
and
the
general
terms
that
he
did.
with
no
showing
of
pretrial
publicity,
that
was
prejudicial,
the
chief
question
of
this
appeal
becomes
whether
the
refusal
of
the
trial
judge
to
ask
the
specific
questions
sought
on
voir
dire
pertaining
to
the
defendant’s
race
and
the
fact
that
he
wears
a
beard.
the
trial
judge
ruled
that
this
proffered
questions
were
irrelevant
and
he
asked
general
questions
instead
and
the
general
questions
being
have
he
formed
or
expressed
any
opinion
as
to
the
guilt
or
innocence
of
the
defendant,
gene
ham?
are
you
conscious
of
any
bias
or
prejudice
for
or
against
him?
can
you
give
the
state
and
the
defendant
a
fair
and
impartial
trial?
the
petitioner
was
present
in
the
courtroom.
he
was
within
view
of
the
jury.
it
was
obvious
that
he
was
negro,
that
he
was
black
and
that
he
wore
beard.
is
it
necessary
that
the
trial
judge
asks,
are
you
aware
of
any
bias
or
prejudice
for
or
against
this
defendant
who
is
a
negro,
black
and
wears
a
beard
when
these
facts
are
so
obvious?
the
state
contends,
not.
did
not,
the
general
questioning
presented
encompasses
specific
inquiries
sought
by
the
petitioner,
we
think
that
it
did.
and
we
think
the
effectiveness
of
this
general
questioning
was
proved
by
the
facts
when
two
jurors
stated
in
response
to
the
general
questions
that
they
could
not
fairly
serve
and
they
were
excused
by
the
trial
court.
mr.
timothy
g.
quinn
i’m
not
aware
of
--
you
mean
which
--
what
was
the
race
have
to
do?
mr.
timothy
g.
quinn
i
don’t
understand
your
question,
your
honor.
mr.
timothy
g.
quinn
yes.
mr.
timothy
g.
quinn
yes,
sir.
mr.
timothy
g.
quinn
yes,
sir.
mr.
timothy
g.
quinn
when
they
stated
that
they
could
not
give
the
state
or
the
defendant
a
fair
and
impartial
trial.
mr.
timothy
g.
quinn
or
that
they
rather
not
serve.
mr.
timothy
g.
quinn
yes,
sir.
i
apologize.
the
two
jurors
were
excused
in
response
to
the
general
question
in
voir
dire,
and
that
was
excused
by
the
court.
were
these
not
more
effectively
than
any
line
of
questioning
cause
of
the
remaining
veniremen
to
be
unnoticed
that
they
cannot
serve
with
an
impartial
attitude?
and
would
that
not
just
cause
the
remaining
veniremen
to
fairly
search
their
souls
for
any
prejudice
or
impartiality
which
would
prevent
their
rendering
a
fair
and
impartial
trial
and
a
fair
and
impartial
verdict
based
upon
the
facts
and
the
evidence
presented?
mr.
timothy
g.
quinn
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
timothy
g.
quinn
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
timothy
g.
quinn
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
timothy
g.
quinn
yes,
i
had
your
honor.
sixth
amendment
united
states
constitution
guarantees
the
right
to
trial
by
an
impartial
jury
has
been
held
that
this
includes
the
right
to
challenge
the
cause
how
about,
neither
way
of
any
holding
that
it
says
a
right
to
preempt
for
a
challenge
is
included
therein.
the
right
to
challenge
the
cause
must
be
accompanied
by
some
showing
of
bias
or
prejudice
which
would
affect
the
juror’s
ability
to
render
a
fair
and
impartial
trial.
clearly
there
was
no
such
showing
in
the
instant
case.
was
the
petitioner
denied
the
opportunity
to
make
such
showing?
did
it
have
any
grounds
to
suspect
bias
or
prejudice?
did
it
present
any
grounds
to
the
trial
judge
justifying
his
suspicion?
none
of
these
things
were
done.
mr.
timothy
g.
quinn
in
this
particular
instance,
i
don’t
anything
will
be
of
loss,
your
honor.
i
think
that
the
trial
judge
was
concerned
with
future
cases
coming
before
it.
these
were
a
short
number
of
questions
and
he
did
rule
that
they
were
irrelevant.
i
think
that
was
within
his
discretion
to
do
so.
but
i
personally
do
not
think
anything
has
been
lost.
mr.
timothy
g.
quinn
i
would
assume
so
your
honor.
mr.
timothy
g.
quinn
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
timothy
g.
quinn
they
were
in
the
records
of
the
--
in
the
case
that
was
appealed
to
the
states
supreme
court
but
they
are
not
in
the
appendix.
that’s
correct.
mr.
timothy
g.
quinn
i
do
not
think
so.
the
law
was
that
petitioner
apparently
contends
would
be
that
the
sixth
amendment
to
united
states
constitution
guarantees
the
right
to
conduct
fishing
expeditions
and
this
we
contend
cannot
be
so.
if
this
were
the
law,
then
the
law
would
reduce
the
function
of
the
trial
judge
and
the
question
of
voir
dire
of
jurors
to
that
of
apparent
thought
to
repeat
each
questions
submitted
to
him
for
it
submitted
that
there’s
no
question
no
matter
how
innocuous
that
might
lead
to
some
bias
or
prejudice.
for
example,
i
expect
that
a
christian
might
have
somewhat
bias
attitude
towards
an
atheist.
i
expect
that
this
might
be
somewhat
bias
toward
the
member
of
the
military
establishment,
and
as
the
chief
justice
stated,
i
expect
that
someone
who
has
a
version
to
pink
shirts
might
have
somewhat
bias
attitude
to
someone
who
wore
one.
but
i
do
not
think
and
i
do
not
contend
that
this
existing
bias
or
prejudice
would
prevent
this
juror
from
rendering
a
fair
and
impartial
trial
upon
giving
his
oath,
affirmation
to
do
so.
i
submit
that
the
sixth
amendment
of
the
united
states
constitution
does
not
guarantee
the
right
to
trial
by
jury
from
a
jury
free
of
all
biases,
all
prejudices
and
all
impartiality.
mr.
timothy
g.
quinn
your
honor,
i
think
this
is
a
crucial
issue
of
the
cases
whether
the
sixth
amendment
of
the
united
states
constitution
guarantees
the
right
to
prove
into
the
prospective
jurors
as
to
whether
--
as
to
the
propriety
of
exercise
and
the
preempt
for
a
chance.
and
i
think
this
is
what
i’m
referring
to
as
a
fishing
expedition
which
i
don’t
think
comes
within
the
confines
of
the
sixth
amendment.
mr.
timothy
g.
quinn
no,
your
honor.
i’m
stating
that
absent
some
showing,
some
basis
for
supporting
the
question
on
voir
dire
then
the
unsupported
questions
can
be
properly
excluded.
mr.
timothy
g.
quinn
i
think
the
issue
was
brought
to
the
attention
of
the
supreme
court
into
arguments
of
the
defendant
at
the
supreme
court
level.
in
the
sense
that
they
alleged
and
alluded
to
the
fact
that
he
was
denied
the
fair
trial,
i
don’t
think
there
were
any
specific
constitutional
issues
involved
particularly
that
brought
forth.
mr.
timothy
g.
quinn
your
honor,
in
our
brief
on
certiorari,
we
did
raised
this
issue
and
supported
in
that
brief
on
certiorari
and
our
brief
in
our
position
of
certiorari
and
we
have
worked
the
contention
at
that
time
that
no
federal
question
was
presented
in
the
state
supreme
court
and
we
would
adhere
to
this
decision
on
our
opinion
today.
mr.
timothy
g.
quinn
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
timothy
g.
quinn
that’s
correct.
mr.
timothy
g.
quinn
no,
i
guess
that
was
the
continuance
--
i
am
sorry,
i
withdraw
it.
mr.
timothy
g.
quinn
that
was
a
continuance.
mr.
timothy
g.
quinn
yes.
the
state
submits
that
the
sixth
amendment
requires
not
that
jurors
be
free
of
all
partiality
whether
such
partiality
does
not
interfere
with
there
duty
to
render
a
fair
and
impartial
trial.
mr.
timothy
g.
quinn
a
situation
in
a
way
such
partiality
if
it
does
exist
is
not
interfered
with
the
rendering
of
a
trial
based
upon
the
facts
and
evidences
as
presented
with
no
outside
influencing
factors,
your
honor.
mr.
timothy
g.
quinn
i
think
everyone
possesses
some
bias
of
some
type
no
matter
how
slight
or
how
--
mr.
timothy
g.
quinn
i
think
that
would
be
an
undue
assumption,
your
honor.
mr.
timothy
g.
quinn
i
can’t
state
that
what
bias
exist
in
anyone.
i
don’t
think
that
anyone
can.
i
don’t
think
that
any
--
mr.
timothy
g.
quinn
i
think
that
they
are
entitled
to
find
out,
your
honor.
mr.
timothy
g.
quinn
there
is
no
way
you
could
find
out
that
way.
mr.
timothy
g.
quinn
however,
there
must
be
some
ground
where
i
believe
about
the
prior
to
the
submitting
of
the
questions
to
the
jurors.
mr.
timothy
g.
quinn
that’s
correct
your
honor,
i
think
that
the
general
questions
asked
did
encompass
specific
question
sought
absent
some
showing
that
the
specific
questions
might
elicit
some
bias
or
prejudice
and
the
suspicion
that
somebody’s
prejudice
must
have
some
grounds
for
that.
i
submit
that
the
sixth
amendment
requires
not
that
the
juror
be
free
of
all
partiality
but
such
a
perfect
jury
does
not
exist.
a
voir
dire
examination
designed
to
uncover
all
existing
biases
of
prejudice
or
partiality
could
lead
to
the
circumstances
recognized
by
one
of
our
state
supreme
court
and
i
state
in
their
opinion
that
i
quote
“the
records
of
the
cases
appeal
to
this
court
in
which
rulings
made
while
impaneling
a
jury
have
been
involved,
indicate
that
there
is
an
increasing
tendency
to
prolong
the
proceedings
inordinately
by
allowing
counsel
on
either
side
to
indulge
of
tedious
examination
of
jurors
apparently
with
no
definite
purpose
or
object
in
view
but
with
a
hope
of
eliciting
something
indicating
the
advisability
of
rendering,
a
preempt
for
a
challenge
and
that
is
supposed
privilege
of
doing
so
has
been
greatly
abused.”
this
opinion
was
rendered
in
1912
and
i
think
this
is
even
more
appropriate
today,
the
congested
court
docket,
and
the
congested
system
of
judicial
administration.
these
go
into
the
conclusion
that
an
unlimited
voir
dire
examination
cannot
coexist
with
efficient
administration
of
justice.
it
must
be
some
compromise.
we
contend
that
this
compromise
is
a
laying
of
the
groundwork
for
the
admission
of
the
particular
question
sought.
absent
of
this
ground,
we
think
that
there
is
no
basis
for
these
questions.
we
contended
there
was
no
abuse
of
discretion
in
the
instant
case
particularly
when
the
judges
--
trial
judges
voir
dire
examination
encompass
the
specific
inquiry
sought
and
was
effective
to
produce
a
jury
which
could
render
a
fair
and
impartial
trial
that
verdict
be
based
upon
the
facts.
rather,
we
state
that
is
more
effective
if
the
question
--
this
general
question
is
proved
to
supply
this
necessary
jury.
for
these
reasons,
we
respectively
--
respectfully
submit
in
conclusion
that
decision
in
south
carolina
state
supreme
court
be
affirmed.
mr.
timothy
g.
quinn
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
facts
of
this
case
having
been
presented
in
the
appendix,
i
will
not
reiterate
them
with
the
permission
of
the
court.
it
basically
appeared
to
be
two
issues
involved.
first,
did
the
trial
judges
refusal
a
prejudicial
pretrial
publicity
or
questioning
as
to
prejudicial
pretrial
publicity
on
the
examination
of
the
jurors
through
the
voir
dire,
violate
their
ability
to
render
a
fair
verdict?
there’s
no
question
to
that
pretrial
publicity
is
a
proper
subject
for
questioning
on
voir
dire.
if
there
is
a
showing
that
pretrial
publicity
did
exist
that
the
pretrial
publicity
did
refer
to
the
petitioner
that
the
pretrial
publicity
was
prejudicial.
in
this
case,
there
was
no
such
showing.
there
was
no
pretrial
publicity
which
referred
directly
to
the
petitioner.
there
was
no
pretrial
publicity
which
is
prejudicial
nor
was
any
pretrial
publicity
other
than
general
publicity
regarding
the
drug
problem
in
the
state
of
south
carolina,
county
of
florence
which
we
contend
there
is
no
--
i
mean
in

in
the
state
today
that
you
cannot
pick
up
with
that
finding,
some
allegations
as
to
drug
use
or
drug
abuse.
the
facts
in
this
case
reveal
that
the
pretrial
publicity
alleged
to
be
prejudicial
consisted
of
three
articles
in
the
same
newspaper
published
on
the
same
date.
none
of
which
referred
to
the
petitioner
and
all
were
dealing
only
generally
with
the
drug
problem.

at
the

of
this
page
it
states
the
clippings,
appearing

under
these
circumstances
we
contend
that
there
was
no
abuse
and
discretion
on
the
part
of
the
trial
judge
in
refusing
to
ask
these
specific
questions

perhaps
at
some
basis
or
even
conjecture
and
that’s
specific
prejudicial
items
might
have

we
contended
it
was
wiser
for
the
trial
judge
to
phrase
before
the
examination
and
the
general
terms
that
he
did.
with
no
showing
of
pretrial
publicity,
that
was
prejudicial,
the
chief
question
of
this
appeal
becomes
whether
the
refusal
of
the
trial
judge
to
ask
the
specific
questions
sought
on
voir
dire
pertaining
to
the
defendant’s
race
and
the
fact
that
he
wears
a
beard.
the
trial
judge
ruled
that
this
proffered
questions
were
irrelevant
and
he
asked
general
questions
instead
and
the
general
questions

can
you
give

the
defendant
a
fair

impartial
trial?
the
petitioner

it
was
obvious
that
he
was
negro,
that

is
it
necessary
that
the
trial
judge
asks,
are
you
aware
of
any
bias
or
prejudice
for
or
against
this
defendant
who
is
a

and
wears

when
these
facts
are
so
obvious?
the
state
contends,
not.
did
not,
the
general
questioning
presented
encompasses
specific
inquiries
sought
by
the
petitioner,
we
think
that
it
did.
and
we
think
the
effectiveness
of
this
general
questioning
was
proved
by
the
facts
when
two

you

mr.

i
don’t

mr.

yes.
mr.

yes,
sir.
mr.
timothy

yes,

when

that
they
could
not
give

a

mr.

or
that
they
rather
not

mr.

yes,

i
apologize.

were
these
not
more
effectively
than
any
line
of
questioning
cause
of
the
remaining
veniremen
to
be
unnoticed
that
they
cannot
serve
with
an
impartial
attitude?
and
would
that
not
just
cause
the
remaining
veniremen
to
fairly
search
their
souls
for
any
prejudice
or
impartiality
which
would
prevent
their
rendering

and

verdict

upon

presented?
mr.

yes,
your
honor.
mr.
timothy
g.

yes,
your

timothy

i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.

yes,
i
had
your

sixth
amendment
united
states
constitution
guarantees
the
right
to
trial
by
an
impartial
jury
has
been
held
that
this
includes
the
right
to
challenge
the
cause
how
about,
neither
way
of
any
holding
that
it
says
a
right
to
preempt
for
a
challenge
is
included
therein.
the
right
to
challenge
the
cause
must
be
accompanied
by
some
showing
of
bias
or
prejudice
which
would
affect
the
juror’s
ability
to
render
a
fair
and
impartial
trial.
clearly
there
was
no
such
showing
in
the
instant
case.
was
the
petitioner
denied
the
opportunity
to
make
such
showing?
did
it
have
any
grounds
to
suspect
bias
or
prejudice?
did
it
present
any
grounds
to
the
trial
judge
justifying
his
suspicion?
none
of
these
things
were
done.
mr.
timothy
g.
quinn
in
this
particular
instance,
i
don’t
anything
will
be
of
loss,
your
honor.
i
think
that
the
trial
judge
was
concerned
with
future
cases
coming
before
it.
these
were
a
short
number
of
questions
and
he
did
rule
that
they
were
irrelevant.
i
think
that
was
within
his
discretion
to
do
so.
but
i
personally
do
not
think
anything
has
been
lost.
mr.
timothy
g.
quinn
i
would
assume
so
your
honor.
mr.
timothy
g.
quinn
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
timothy
g.
quinn
they
were
in
the
records
of
the
--
in
the
case
that
was
appealed
to
the
states
supreme
court
but
they
are
not
in
the
appendix.
that’s
correct.
mr.
timothy
g.
quinn
i
do
not
think
so.
the
law
was
that
petitioner
apparently
contends
would
be
that
the
sixth
amendment
to
united
states
constitution
guarantees
the
right
to
conduct
fishing
expeditions
and
this
we
contend
cannot
be
so.
if
this
were
the
law,
then
the
law
would
reduce
the
function
of
the
trial
judge
and
the
question
of
voir
dire
of
jurors
to
that
of
apparent
thought
to
repeat
each
questions
submitted
to
him
for
it
submitted
that
there’s
no
question
no
matter
how
innocuous
that
might
lead
to
some
bias
or
prejudice.
for
example,
i
expect
that
a
christian
might
have
somewhat
bias
attitude
towards
an
atheist.
i
expect
that
this
might
be
somewhat
bias
toward
the
member
of
the
military
establishment,
and
as
the
chief
justice
stated,
i
expect
that
someone
who
has
a
version
to
pink
shirts
might
have
somewhat
bias
attitude
to
someone
who
wore
one.
but
i
do
not
think
and
i
do
not
contend
that
this
existing
bias
or
prejudice
would
prevent
this
juror
from
rendering
a
fair
and
impartial
trial
upon
giving
his
oath,
affirmation
to
do
so.
i
submit
that
the
sixth
amendment
of
the
united
states
constitution
does
not
guarantee
the
right
to
trial
by
jury
from
a
jury
free
of
all
biases,
all
prejudices
and
all
impartiality.
mr.
timothy
g.
quinn
your
honor,
i
think
this
is
a
crucial
issue
of
the
cases
whether
the
sixth
amendment
of
the
united
states
constitution
guarantees
the
right
to
prove
into
the
prospective
jurors
as
to
whether
--
as
to
the
propriety
of
exercise
and
the
preempt
for
a
chance.
and
i
think
this
is
what
i’m
referring
to
as
a
fishing
expedition
which
i
don’t
think
comes
within
the
confines
of
the
sixth
amendment.
mr.
timothy
g.
quinn
no,
your
honor.
i’m
stating
that
absent
some
showing,
some
basis
for
supporting
the
question
on
voir
dire
then
the
unsupported
questions
can
be
properly
excluded.
mr.
timothy
g.
quinn
i
think
the
issue
was
brought
to
the
attention
of
the
supreme
court
into
arguments
of
the
defendant
at
the
supreme
court
level.
in
the
sense
that
they
alleged
and
alluded
to
the
fact
that
he
was
denied
the
fair
trial,
i
don’t
think
there
were
any
specific
constitutional
issues
involved
particularly
that
brought
forth.
mr.
timothy
g.
quinn
your
honor,
in
our
brief
on
certiorari,
we
did
raised
this
issue
and
supported
in
that
brief
on
certiorari
and
our
brief
in
our
position
of
certiorari
and
we
have
worked
the
contention
at
that
time
that
no
federal
question
was
presented
in
the
state
supreme
court
and
we
would
adhere
to
this
decision
on
our
opinion
today.
mr.
timothy
g.
quinn
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
timothy
g.
quinn
that’s
correct.
mr.
timothy
g.
quinn
no,
i
guess
that
was
the
continuance
--
i
am
sorry,
i
withdraw
it.
mr.
timothy
g.
quinn
that
was
a
continuance.
mr.
timothy
g.
quinn
yes.
the
state
submits
that
the
sixth
amendment
requires
not
that
jurors
be
free
of
all
partiality
whether
such
partiality
does
not
interfere
with
there
duty
to
render
a
fair
and
impartial
trial.
mr.
timothy
g.
quinn
a
situation
in
a
way
such
partiality
if
it
does
exist
is
not
interfered
with
the
rendering
of
a
trial
based
upon
the
facts
and
evidences
as
presented
with
no
outside
influencing
factors,
your
honor.
mr.
timothy
g.
quinn
i
think
everyone
possesses
some
bias
of
some
type
no
matter
how
slight
or
how
--
mr.
timothy
g.
quinn
i
think
that
would
be
an
undue
assumption,
your
honor.
mr.
timothy
g.
quinn
i
can’t
state
that
what
bias
exist
in
anyone.
i
don’t
think
that
anyone
can.
i
don’t
think
that
any
--
mr.
timothy
g.
quinn
i
think
that
they
are
entitled
to
find
out,
your
honor.
mr.
timothy
g.
quinn
there
is
no
way
you
could
find
out
that
way.
mr.
timothy
g.
quinn
however,
there
must
be
some
ground
where
i
believe
about
the
prior
to
the
submitting
of
the
questions
to
the
jurors.
mr.
timothy
g.
quinn
that’s
correct
your
honor,
i
think
that
the
general
questions
asked
did
encompass
specific
question
sought
absent
some
showing
that
the
specific
questions
might
elicit
some
bias
or
prejudice
and
the
suspicion
that
somebody’s
prejudice
must
have
some
grounds
for
that.
i
submit
that
the
sixth
amendment
requires
not
that
the
juror
be
free
of
all
partiality
but
such
a
perfect
jury
does
not
exist.
a
voir
dire
examination
designed
to
uncover
all
existing
biases
of
prejudice
or
partiality
could
lead
to
the
circumstances
recognized
by
one
of
our
state
supreme
court
and
i
state
in
their
opinion
that
i
quote
“the
records
of
the
cases
appeal
to
this
court
in
which
rulings
made
while
impaneling
a
jury
have
been
involved,
indicate
that
there
is
an
increasing
tendency
to
prolong
the
proceedings
inordinately
by
allowing
counsel
on
either
side
to
indulge
of
tedious
examination
of
jurors
apparently
with
no
definite
purpose
or
object
in
view
but
with
a
hope
of
eliciting
something
indicating
the
advisability
of
rendering,
a
preempt
for
a
challenge
and
that
is
supposed
privilege
of
doing
so
has
been
greatly
abused.”
this
opinion
was
rendered
in
1912
and
i
think
this
is
even
more
appropriate
today,
the
congested
court
docket,
and
the
congested
system
of
judicial
administration.
these
go
into
the
conclusion
that
an
unlimited
voir
dire
examination
cannot
coexist
with
efficient
administration
of
justice.
it
must
be
some
compromise.
we
contend
that
this
compromise
is
a
laying
of
the
groundwork
for
the
admission
of
the
particular
question
sought.
absent
of
this
ground,
we
think
that
there
is
no
basis
for
these
questions.
we
contended
there
was
no
abuse
of
discretion
in
the
instant
case
particularly
when
the
judges
--
trial
judges
voir
dire
examination
encompass
the
specific
inquiry
sought
and
was
effective
to
produce
a
jury
which
could
render
a
fair
and
impartial
trial
that
verdict
be
based
upon
the
facts.
rather,
we
state
that
is
more
effective
if
the
question
--
this
general
question
is
proved
to
supply
this
necessary
jury.
for
these
reasons,
we
respectively
--
respectfully
submit
in
conclusion
that
decision
in
south
carolina
state
supreme
court
be
affirmed.
