mr.
samuel
huntington
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
these
consolidated
cases
are
here
in
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
to
the
district
of
columbia
circuit.
the
basic
question
presented
is
whether
the
federal
power
commission
is
barred
by
section
441
of
the
tax
reform
act
of
1969
from
permitting
a
company
subject
to
its
jurisdiction
to
seize
flowing
through
to
the
company’s
customers
in
the
form
of
lower
rates.
the
benefits
derived
from
the
use
of
accelerated
depreciation
on
certain
property.
if
the
tax
reform
act
is
not
by
such
action,
the
question
arises
whether
the
commission’s
action
in
this
case
was
improper.
before
i
discuss
the
facts
of
this
case,
some
introduction
is
appropriate.
it
has
wrong
been
established
that
federal
income
taxes
are
includable
as
an
expense
under
the
cost
of
service
method
used
by
the
federal
power
commission
in
ratemaking.
accelerated
tax
depreciation
was
first
authorized
by
in
1954
with
the
adoption
of
section
167
of
the
internal
revenue
code.
under
accelerated
tax
depreciation,
deductions
for
a
particular
asset
are
relatively
high
in
its
early
years
and
relatively
low
in
its
later
years
compared
to
what
they
would
have
been
had
straight-line
tax
depreciation
been
used.
when
the
matter
first
came
before
the
commission
in
a
ratemaking
context,
the
commission
determined
that
the
use
of
accelerated
tax
depreciation
simply
resulted
in
a
tax
deferral.
accordingly,
the
commission
decided
that
for
ratemaking
purposes
a
company’s
taxes
should
be
normalized,
that
--
mr.
samuel
huntington
that’s
right,
historically;
it
back
was
in
1956
or
so.
the
commission
decided
that
the
--
for
ratemaking
purposes,
the
tax
should
be
normalized
and
by
normalized,
it
means
that
they
should
be
calculated
as
if
the
company
had
used
straight-line
tax
depreciation.
the
difference
between
the
taxes
actually
paid
and
the
higher
normalized
taxes
claimed
as
cost
of
service
was
required
to
be
placed
in
a
special
tax
reserve
account
for
the
payment
of
future
taxes.
several
years
later,
the
commission
in
the
alabama-tennessee
case
reconsidered
the
matter.
it
concluded
there
that
the
use
of
accelerated
tax
depreciation
resulted
in
a
permanent
tax
savings.
this
conclusion
was
squarely
based
on
the
commission’s
finding
that
the
natural
gas
industry
would
continue
to
expand
rapidly
for
the
foreseeable
future,
an
assumption
which
is
certainly
not
true
today.
the
commission
noted
that
when
an
expanding
company
uses
accelerated
tax
depreciation
sufficient
tax
depreciation
deductions
on
new
property
are
available
to
all
set
declining
tax
depreciation
deductions
on
all
property.
the
commission
does
ordered
natural
gas
companies
using
accelerated
depreciation
for
tax
purposes.
to
also
use
accelerated
tax
depreciation
for
ratemaking
purposes.
in
this
way,
the
benefits
of
accelerated
tax
depreciation
would
be
flowed
through
to
the
company’s
customers.
it’s
important
to
note
that
both
the
commission’s
normalization
order
and
its
flow-through
order
were
upheld
by
various
courts
of
appeals
as
being
within
the
commission’s
discretion.
other
regulatory
agencies
are
sharply
divided
on
this
issue.
in
short,
the
matter
is
in
technical
one
turns
in
large
part
on
an
analysis
of
particular
facts
pertaining
to
give
an
industry
and
is
precisely
the
type
of
question
which
falls
within
the
broad
discretion
that
regulatory
agencies
have
over
ratemaking.
this
brings
us
to
section
441
of
the
tax
reform
act
of
1969.
as
the
legislative
history
of
the
act
makes
clear,
congress
was
concerned
with
the
lost
of
revenues
to
the
government
resulting
from
the
use
of
accelerated
tax
depreciation
by
public
utilities.
rather
than
prohibit
the
use
of
accelerated
tax
depreciation
all
together,
congress
chose
simply
to
bar
future
shifts
to
faster
methods
of
depreciation.
with
respect
to
existing
or
pre-1970
property,
the
statute
permits
the
use
of
one
straight-line
tax
depreciation,
two,
accelerated
depreciation
with
normalization
if
the
utility
had
been
using
accelerated
depreciation
when
the
act
was
passed;
and
three,
accelerated
depreciation
with
“flow-through”
if
the
company
had
been
using
“flow-through”
when
the
act
was
passed.
mr.
samuel
huntington
no,
it
doesn’t
--
not
that
i’m
aware
of.
they
did
focused
on
the
practice
while
there’s
a
double
revenue
loss
when
--
mr.
samuel
huntington
accelerated
tax
depreciation
is
flow-through.
mr.
samuel
huntington
there’s
first
the
loss
resulting
to
the
increase
that
deduction
--
mr.
samuel
huntington
and
then
secondly,
there’s
a
lower
rates
due
to
the
flow-through
which
means
that
there’s
less
revenues
to
be
taxed
by
the
utilities
--
have
less
revenues
coming
in
to
be
taxed
because
the
benefits
are
passed
on
in
lower
rates.
mr.
samuel
huntington
lower
rates
to
the
consumer.
now,
similar
rules
apply
to
new
or
post
1969
property,
but
with
respect
to
new
property
which
expands
a
company’s
capacity,
an
additional
rule
was
adopted.
under
section
167
(l)
(4)
(a)
of
the
code
regulated
companies
on
“flow-through”
were
given
the
right
to
elect
not
to
have
“flow-through”
apply
to
their
expansion
of
property.
as
the
legislative
history
of
the
statute
indicates
the
effect
of
this
provision
is
to
permit
companies
in
making
the
election
to
use
straight-line
tax
depreciation
without
having
to
obtain
the
approval
of
the
regulatory
authority.
in
an
order
upheld
by
the
court
below
and
not
an
issue
here,
the
federal
power
commission
announced
as
a
general
policy,
it
would
permit
companies
making
the
election
to
use
normalization
on
their
expansion
property.
i
come
now
to
this
case
after
the
tax
reform
act
was
enacted,
texas
gas
transmission
corporation,
the
petitioner
here
indicated
to
the
commission
in
a
pending
rate
proceeding
that
it
would
make
the
election
not
to
use
“flow-through”
on
its
expansion
property.
the
company
sought
the
commission’s
permission
to
use
--
mr.
samuel
huntington
well,
it
said
that
it
would
use
--
it
sought
permission
to
use
normalization
on
the
expansion
property
as
well
as
on
its
existing
property.
it
said
that
if
the
commission
did
not
give
a
permission
to
use
normalization,
it
would
straight-line
depreciation
on
its
expansion
property.
the
commission
granted
the
commission
both
to
with
respect
to
expansion
property
and
existing
property.
the
commission
found
that
once
texas
gas
had
switch
to
normalization
on
its
expansion
property,
tax
depreciation
on
that
property
would
no
longer
be
available
to
offset
declining
tax
depreciation
on
existing
and
replacement
property.
the
reason
it
would
no
longer
be
available,
is
that
under
normalization
benefits
from
the
use
of
accelerated
depreciation
on
expansion
property
are
placed
in
a
deferred
tax
reserve
account
and
may
only
be
use
to
pay
future
taxes
on
the
expansion
property.
the
deferred
tax
reserve
is
the
very
essence
of
normalization
and
its
part
of
the
statutory
definition
of
normalization
in
the
tax
reform
act,
that
section
167
(l)
(3)
(g),
the
definition
section
of
the
act.
with
expansion
property
out
of
the
picture,
the
commission
concluded
that
the
use
of
accelerated
tax
depreciation
on
existing
and
replacement
property
would
no
longer
resolve
in
a
permanent
tax
savings.
under
these
circumstances,
the
commission
held
that
the
use
of
normalization
on
all
of
the
property
of
texas
gas
would
lead
to
more
stable
tax
cost
for
ratemaking
purpose
and
it
would
in
the
public
interest.
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
reach
the
ultimate
merits
of
the
commission’s
order
but
held
that
section
441
of
the
tax
reform
act
foreclose
the
commission
from
permitting
switches
from
flow-through
to
normalization.
it
is
to
that
issue,
i
will
now
turn.
there
is
nothing
on
the
face
section
441
which
suggests
that
regulatory
agencies
may
not
permit
shifts
from
flow-through
to
normalization.
as
i
have
noted,
the
statute
merely
lists
the
permissible
methods
of
tax
depreciation
in
such
a
way
as
to
bar
shifts
from
slower
to
faster
methods
of
depreciation.
under
the
literal
terms
of
the
stature,
companies
on
“flow-through”
qualify
for
all
three
methods
of
depreciation
that
a
straight-line
depreciation
accelerated,
depreciation
with
normalization
and
accelerated
depreciation
with
flow-through.
the
election
provision
simply
gives
a
company
the
right
to
elect
not
to
use
“flow-through”
on
expansion
property.
the
legislative
history
of
the
statute
confirms
that
the
statute
does
not
bar
ships
from
“flow-through”
to
normalization
with
appropriate
regulatory
agency
approval.
the
house
report
on
the
initial
version
which
did
not
include
the
election
provision.
the
house
report
describes
the
effect
of
the
bill
in
three
general
rules.
the
house
report
describes
these
three
general
rules.
the
third
rule
in
the
house
report
is
that
if
“flow-through”
is
being
use,
the
tax
payer
must
continue
to
use
“flow-through”
unless
the
appropriate
regulatory
agency
permits
a
change
as
to
that
property.
respondents
argue
vigorously
that
this
third
general
rule
refer
to
in
the
house
report
was
displaced
by
the
election
provision.
the
election
provision
was
first
added
by
the
senate
to
apply
to
all
property
and
later
restricted
in
conference
to
apply
only
to
expansion
property.
it
is
our
submission
that
the
election
provision
does
not
affect
a
regulatory
agency’s
authority
to
permit
companies
to
abandon
“flow-through.”
all
the
election
provision
does
is
to
give
utilities
the
absolute
right
without
having
to
go
to
the
agency
first
to
get
off
“flow-through.”
this
was
not
provided
in
the
house
bill,
the
only
way
agency
could
get
of
“flow-through”
under
the
house
bill
was
to
get
the
regulatory
agency’s
approval.
now,
we
have
quoted
the
relevant
excerpts
of
the
senate
report
and
the
conference
report
in
our
brief
at
pages
23
to
25.
and
that
we
submit
that
a
reading
of
those
reports
clearly
supports
our
position.
in
fact,
respondents
studiously
avoid
a
direct
confrontation
with
the
pertinent
provisions
of
these
two
reports,
which
we
submit
are
very
pertinent
indeed.
respondents
also
vigorously
argue
that
certain
language
in
the
house
and
senate
reports
to
the
effect
that
the
legislation
would
freeze
existing
depreciation
practices
supports
their
construction
of
the
statute.
the
house
report
for
example
noted
that
requirement
that
all
for
the
later
companies
revert
immediately
to
straight-line
depreciation
would
place
some
regulated
companies
that
a
competitive
disadvantage
would
result
in
wide
spread
rate
increases.
accordingly,
the
house
committee
had
determined
“in
general
to
freeze
the
current
situation
regarding
methods
of
depreciation.”
the
short
answer
to
respondent’s
contention
on
this
freeze
language
is
that
the
freeze
language
appeared
first
in
the
house
report
and
was
largely
copied
by
the
senate.
but
the
house
bill
as
everyone
acknowledges
had
three
general
rules,
so
the
“freeze”
was
obviously
subject
to
the
three
general
rules
and
as
i
have
noted
the
third
rule
explicitly
acknowledges
that
the
legislation
permits
the
abandonment
of
“flow-through”
with
the
approval
of
the
appropriate
regulatory
authority.
mr.
samuel
huntington
i’d
like
to
talk
first
about
the
power
issue
and
then
i
have
few
remarks
to
say
about
the
commission’s
exercise
of
discretion
in
this
case.
when
mr.
morrow
conceded
that
there
maybe
certain
circumstances
under
which
the
commission
could
permit
and
abandonment
of
“flow-through”
with
respect
to
existing
property,
i
think
he
conceded
this
point.
that
is
precisely
our
position
and
it’s
a
matter
of
commission
discretion
that
this
is
what
the
third
rule
in
the
house
provided.
it
left
this
type
of
thing
up
to
the
commission.
the
only
thing
the
election
provision
here
was
to
give
the
companies
an
absolute
right
without
getting
regulatory
agency
approval
to
get
off
“flow-through.”
now,
the
language
in
the
senate
report
is
pertinent
because
it
was
the
senate
that
added
the
election
provision.
and
the
language
in
the
report
shows
that
in
adding
it,
it
did
not
mean
to
displace
the
third
rule.
mr.
samuel
huntington
yes,
the
power.
yes,
i’m
sure.
we
argued
to
the
court
--
mr.
samuel
huntington
the
court
of
appeals
stressed
certain
language
in
the
conference
report
which
i
don’t
think
i
will
go
in
to
here.
but
it
is
we
do
come
to
grips
with
that
issue
rather
squarely
in
our
brief
and
we
think
there’s
just
a
total
misreading
of
the
conference
report
and
that
we
must
rely
on
the
senate
report
and
that
in
merely
narrowing
the
election
from
existing
property
to
expansion
property
that
conference
certainly
did
not
mean
to
negate
the
general
rule
referred
to
in
to
a
house
and
the
senate
report.
i’d
like
to
now
to
turn
to
the
--
assuming
that
the
commission
has
the
power,
was
it
properly
exercised
in
this
case.
now,
both
respondents
here
and
in
their
briefs
talk
about
the
actual
taxes
doctrine
while
the
actual
taxes
doctrine
has
never
been
thought
or
never
been
held
to
preclude
the
commission
from
exercising
its
discrimination
in
how
to
treat
liberalized
tax
depreciation
for
ratemaking
purposes.
it
is
largely
a
question
of
whether
the
taxes
result
in
a
--
whether
the
use
of
liberalize
depreciation
results
in
a
tax
deferral
or
a
tax
savings.
now,
if
we
could
consider
all
of
texas
gas
property
together,
then
we
would
have
a
different
case
than
we
have
here.
then
you
would
continue
assuming
that
texas
gas
continued
to
expand,
you
would
have
--
you
would
have
--
you
would
be
able
to
use
the
benefits
from
the
expansion
property
with
respect
to
the
old
property.
but
congress
made
the
segregation.
congress
said,
“with
respect
to
expansion
property,
you
can
get
off
“flow-through”,
you
can
go
to
straight-line
and
if
you
can
get
the
agencies
approval,
you
can
go
to
normalization.”
so,
congress
segregated
these
types
of
properties.
so
you
cannot
consider
the
tax
benefits
from
the
expansion
property
in
determining
what
method
of
accounting
to
apply
to
the
existing
property
for
ratemaking
purposes.
the
whole
concept
of
normalization
is
that
you
take
the
benefits
and
you
put
them
into
a
reserve
account.
they
are
not
available
for
anything
else.
they
are
in
that
account
so
that
you
can
pay
future
taxes
with
respect
to
that
property.
mr.
samuel
huntington
no,
it’s
a
--
mr.
samuel
huntington
it’s
an
accounting
thing,
but
you
cannot.
those
funds
are
not
available
--
mr.
samuel
huntington
well,
as
far
--
in
other
words,
the
company
is
required
to
maintain
an
account
of
sufficient
size
to
pay
future
taxes
with
respect
to
that
property.
the
--
as
far
as
paying
--
mr.
samuel
huntington
you
collected
it
from
the
--
mr.
samuel
huntington
that’s
right.
mr.
samuel
huntington
well,
for
ratemaking
purpose
the
amount
is
deducted
from
the
rate
base
so
that
it
is
essentially
[voice
overlap]
--
mr.
samuel
huntington
for
ratemaking
purposes
the
--
mr.
samuel
huntington
as
you
actually
paid
and
you
haven’t
paid
--
mr.
samuel
huntington
that’s
right.
but
because
congress
specifically
said,
alright,
you
can
use
this
method
on
expansion
property.
it
is
congress
that
has
made
the
segregation
and
therefore
you
have
to
look
just
at
the
existing
property
in
determining
what
method
to
use
there.
and
there
we
say
the
commission
was
correct
in
determining
that
the
use
of
“flow-through”
was
no
longer
appropriate
and
had
full
discretion
this
is
a
matter
completely
within
the
commission’s
discretion
to
analyze
these
facts
and
make
it
--
mr.
samuel
huntington
it
said
why
i
did
it.
mr.
samuel
huntington
it
did
it
because
with
respect
to
existing
property,
there
were
no
longer
be
sufficient
deductions
to
offset
the
declining
balances
on
the
existing
property
from
year
to
year,
the
tax
depreciation
deductions
would
decline.
therefore,
instead
of
having
a
tax
savings
with
respect
to
that
property
is
merely
a
tax
deferral
to
pass
it
on
in
the
form
of
lower
rates
now
would

future

thank
you.
mr.
samuel
huntington
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
these
consolidated
cases
are
here
in
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
to
the
district
of
columbia
circuit.
the
basic
question
presented
is
whether
the
federal
power
commission
is
barred
by
section
441
of
the
tax
reform
act
of
1969
from
permitting
a
company
subject
to
its
jurisdiction
to
seize
flowing
through
to
the
company’s
customers
in
the
form
of
lower
rates.
the
benefits
derived
from
the
use
of
accelerated
depreciation
on
certain
property.
if
the
tax
reform
act
is
not
by
such
action,
the
question
arises
whether
the
commission’s
action
in
this
case
was
improper.
before
i
discuss
the
facts
of
this
case,
some
introduction
is
appropriate.
it
has
wrong
been
established
that
federal
income
taxes
are
includable
as
an
expense
under
the
cost
of
service
method
used
by
the
federal
power
commission
in
ratemaking.
accelerated
tax
depreciation
was
first
authorized
by
in
1954
with
the
adoption
of
section
167
of
the
internal
revenue
code.
under
accelerated
tax
depreciation,
deductions
for
a
particular
asset
are
relatively
high
in
its
early
years
and
relatively
low
in
its
later
years
compared
to
what
they
would
have
been
had
straight-line
tax
depreciation
been
used.
when
the
matter
first
came
before
the
commission
in
a
ratemaking
context,
the
commission
determined
that
the
use
of
accelerated
tax
depreciation
simply
resulted
in
a
tax
deferral.
accordingly,
the
commission
decided
that
for
ratemaking
purposes
a
company’s
taxes
should
be
normalized,
that
--
mr.
samuel
huntington
that’s
right,
historically;
it
back
was
in
1956
or
so.
the
commission
decided
that
the
--
for
ratemaking
purposes,
the
tax
should
be
normalized
and
by
normalized,
it
means
that
they
should
be
calculated
as
if
the
company
had
used
straight-line
tax
depreciation.
the
difference
between
the
taxes
actually
paid
and
the
higher
normalized
taxes
claimed
as
cost
of
service
was
required
to
be
placed
in
a
special
tax
reserve
account
for
the
payment
of
future
taxes.
several
years
later,
the
commission
in
the
alabama-tennessee
case
reconsidered
the
matter.
it
concluded
there
that
the
use
of
accelerated
tax
depreciation
resulted
in
a
permanent
tax
savings.
this
conclusion
was
squarely
based
on
the
commission’s
finding
that
the
natural
gas
industry
would
continue
to
expand
rapidly
for
the
foreseeable
future,
an
assumption
which
is
certainly
not
true
today.
the
commission
noted
that
when
an
expanding
company
uses
accelerated
tax
depreciation
sufficient
tax
depreciation
deductions
on
new
property
are
available
to
all
set
declining
tax
depreciation
deductions
on
all
property.
the
commission
does
ordered
natural
gas
companies
using
accelerated
depreciation
for
tax
purposes.
to
also
use
accelerated
tax
depreciation
for
ratemaking
purposes.
in
this
way,
the
benefits
of
accelerated
tax
depreciation
would
be
flowed
through
to
the
company’s
customers.
it’s
important
to
note
that
both
the
commission’s
normalization
order
and
its
flow-through
order
were
upheld
by
various
courts
of
appeals
as
being
within
the
commission’s
discretion.
other
regulatory
agencies
are
sharply
divided
on
this
issue.
in
short,
the
matter
is
in
technical
one
turns
in
large
part
on
an
analysis
of
particular
facts
pertaining
to
give
an
industry
and
is
precisely
the
type
of
question
which
falls
within
the
broad
discretion
that
regulatory
agencies
have
over
ratemaking.
this
brings
us
to
section
441
of
the
tax
reform
act
of
1969.
as
the
legislative
history
of
the
act
makes
clear,
congress
was
concerned
with
the
lost
of
revenues
to
the
government
resulting
from
the
use
of
accelerated
tax
depreciation
by
public
utilities.
rather
than
prohibit
the
use
of
accelerated
tax
depreciation
all
together,
congress
chose
simply
to
bar
future
shifts
to
faster
methods
of
depreciation.
with
respect
to
existing
or
pre-1970
property,
the
statute
permits
the
use
of
one
straight-line
tax
depreciation,
two,
accelerated
depreciation
with
normalization
if
the
utility
had
been
using
accelerated
depreciation
when
the
act
was
passed;
and
three,
accelerated
depreciation
with
“flow-through”
if
the
company
had
been
using
“flow-through”
when
the
act
was
passed.
mr.
samuel
huntington
no,
it
doesn’t
--
not
that
i’m
aware
of.
they
did
focused
on
the
practice
while
there’s
a
double
revenue
loss
when
--
mr.
samuel
huntington
accelerated
tax
depreciation
is
flow-through.
mr.
samuel
huntington
there’s
first
the
loss
resulting
to
the
increase
that
deduction
--
mr.
samuel
huntington
and
then
secondly,
there’s
a
lower
rates
due
to
the
flow-through
which
means
that
there’s
less
revenues
to
be
taxed
by
the
utilities
--
have
less
revenues
coming
in
to
be
taxed
because
the
benefits
are
passed
on
in
lower
rates.
mr.
samuel
huntington
lower
rates
to
the
consumer.
now,
similar
rules
apply
to
new
or
post
1969
property,
but
with
respect
to
new
property
which
expands
a
company’s
capacity,
an
additional
rule
was
adopted.
under
section
167
(l)
(4)
(a)
of
the
code
regulated
companies
on
“flow-through”
were
given
the
right
to
elect
not
to
have
“flow-through”
apply
to
their
expansion
of
property.
as
the
legislative
history
of
the
statute
indicates
the
effect
of
this
provision
is
to
permit
companies
in
making
the
election
to
use
straight-line
tax
depreciation
without
having
to
obtain
the
approval
of
the
regulatory
authority.
in
an
order
upheld
by
the
court
below
and
not
an
issue
here,
the
federal
power
commission
announced
as
a
general
policy,
it
would
permit
companies
making
the
election
to
use
normalization
on
their
expansion
property.
i
come
now
to
this
case
after
the
tax
reform
act
was
enacted,
texas
gas
transmission
corporation,
the
petitioner
here
indicated
to
the
commission
in
a
pending
rate
proceeding
that
it
would
make
the
election
not
to
use
“flow-through”
on
its
expansion
property.
the
company
sought
the
commission’s
permission
to
use
--
mr.
samuel
huntington
well,
it
said
that
it
would
use
--
it
sought
permission
to
use
normalization
on
the
expansion
property
as
well
as
on
its
existing
property.
it
said
that
if
the
commission
did
not
give
a
permission
to
use
normalization,
it
would
straight-line
depreciation
on
its
expansion
property.
the
commission
granted
the
commission
both
to
with
respect
to
expansion
property
and
existing
property.
the
commission
found
that
once
texas
gas
had
switch
to
normalization
on
its
expansion
property,
tax
depreciation
on
that
property
would
no
longer
be
available
to
offset
declining
tax
depreciation
on
existing
and
replacement
property.
the
reason
it
would
no
longer
be
available,
is
that
under
normalization
benefits
from
the
use
of
accelerated
depreciation
on
expansion
property
are
placed
in
a
deferred
tax
reserve
account
and
may
only
be
use
to
pay
future
taxes
on
the
expansion
property.
the
deferred
tax
reserve
is
the
very
essence
of
normalization
and
its
part
of
the
statutory
definition
of
normalization
in
the
tax
reform
act,
that
section
167
(l)
(3)
(g),
the
definition
section
of
the
act.
with
expansion
property
out
of
the
picture,
the
commission
concluded
that
the
use
of
accelerated
tax
depreciation
on
existing
and
replacement
property
would
no
longer
resolve
in
a
permanent
tax
savings.
under
these
circumstances,
the
commission
held
that
the
use
of
normalization
on
all
of
the
property
of
texas
gas
would
lead
to
more
stable
tax
cost
for
ratemaking
purpose
and
it
would
in
the
public
interest.
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
reach
the
ultimate
merits
of
the
commission’s
order
but
held
that
section
441
of
the
tax
reform
act
foreclose
the
commission
from
permitting
switches
from
flow-through
to
normalization.
it
is
to
that
issue,
i
will
now
turn.
there
is
nothing
on
the
face
section
441
which
suggests
that
regulatory
agencies
may
not
permit
shifts
from
flow-through
to
normalization.
as
i
have
noted,
the
statute
merely
lists
the
permissible
methods
of
tax
depreciation
in
such
a
way
as
to
bar
shifts
from
slower
to
faster
methods
of
depreciation.
under
the
literal
terms
of
the
stature,
companies
on
“flow-through”
qualify
for
all
three
methods
of
depreciation
that
a
straight-line
depreciation
accelerated,
depreciation
with
normalization
and
accelerated
depreciation
with
flow-through.
the
election
provision
simply
gives
a
company
the
right
to
elect
not
to
use
“flow-through”
on
expansion
property.
the
legislative
history
of
the
statute
confirms
that
the
statute
does
not
bar
ships
from
“flow-through”
to
normalization
with
appropriate
regulatory
agency
approval.
the
house
report
on
the
initial
version
which
did
not
include
the
election
provision.
the
house
report
describes
the
effect
of
the
bill
in
three
general
rules.
the
house
report
describes
these
three
general
rules.
the
third
rule
in
the
house
report
is
that
if
“flow-through”
is
being
use,
the
tax
payer
must
continue
to
use
“flow-through”
unless
the
appropriate
regulatory
agency
permits
a
change
as
to
that
property.
respondents
argue
vigorously
that
this
third
general
rule
refer
to
in
the
house
report
was
displaced
by
the
election
provision.
the
election
provision
was
first
added
by
the
senate
to
apply
to
all
property
and
later
restricted
in
conference
to
apply
only
to
expansion
property.
it
is
our
submission
that
the
election
provision
does
not
affect
a
regulatory
agency’s
authority
to
permit
companies
to
abandon
“flow-through.”
all
the
election
provision
does
is
to
give
utilities
the
absolute
right
without
having
to
go
to
the
agency
first
to
get
off
“flow-through.”
this
was
not
provided
in
the
house
bill,
the
only
way
agency
could
get
of
“flow-through”
under
the
house
bill
was
to
get
the
regulatory
agency’s
approval.
now,
we
have
quoted
the
relevant
excerpts
of
the
senate
report
and
the
conference
report
in
our
brief
at
pages
23
to
25.
and
that
we
submit
that
a
reading
of
those
reports
clearly
supports
our
position.
in
fact,
respondents
studiously
avoid
a
direct
confrontation
with
the
pertinent
provisions
of
these
two
reports,
which
we
submit
are
very
pertinent
indeed.
respondents
also
vigorously
argue
that
certain
language
in
the
house
and
senate
reports
to
the
effect
that
the
legislation
would
freeze
existing
depreciation
practices
supports
their
construction
of
the
statute.
the
house
report
for
example
noted
that
requirement
that
all
for
the
later
companies
revert
immediately
to
straight-line
depreciation
would
place
some
regulated
companies
that
a
competitive
disadvantage
would
result
in
wide
spread
rate
increases.
accordingly,
the
house
committee
had
determined
“in
general
to
freeze
the
current
situation
regarding
methods
of
depreciation.”
the
short
answer
to
respondent’s
contention
on
this
freeze
language
is
that
the
freeze
language
appeared
first
in
the
house
report
and
was
largely
copied
by
the
senate.
but
the
house
bill
as
everyone
acknowledges
had
three
general
rules,
so
the
“freeze”
was
obviously
subject
to
the
three
general
rules
and
as
i
have
noted
the
third
rule
explicitly
acknowledges
that
the
legislation
permits
the
abandonment
of
“flow-through”
with
the
approval
of
the
appropriate
regulatory
authority.
mr.
samuel
huntington
i’d
like
to
talk
first
about
the
power
issue
and
then
i
have
few
remarks
to
say
about
the
commission’s
exercise
of
discretion
in
this
case.
when
mr.
morrow
conceded
that
there
maybe
certain
circumstances
under
which
the
commission
could
permit
and
abandonment
of
“flow-through”
with
respect
to
existing
property,
i
think
he
conceded
this
point.
that
is
precisely
our
position
and
it’s
a
matter
of
commission
discretion
that
this
is
what
the
third
rule
in
the
house
provided.
it
left
this
type
of
thing
up
to
the
commission.
the
only
thing
the
election
provision
here
was
to
give
the
companies
an
absolute
right
without
getting
regulatory
agency
approval
to
get
off
“flow-through.”
now,
the
language
in
the
senate
report
is
pertinent
because
it
was
the
senate
that
added
the
election
provision.
and
the
language
in
the
report
shows
that
in
adding
it,
it
did
not
mean
to
displace
the
third
rule.
mr.
samuel
huntington
yes,
the
power.
yes,
i’m
sure.
we
argued
to
the
court
--
mr.
samuel
huntington
the
court
of
appeals
stressed
certain
language
in
the
conference
report
which
i
don’t
think
i
will
go
in
to
here.
but
it
is
we
do
come
to
grips
with
that
issue
rather
squarely
in
our
brief
and
we
think
there’s
just
a
total
misreading
of
the
conference
report
and
that
we
must
rely
on
the
senate
report
and
that
in
merely
narrowing
the
election
from
existing
property
to
expansion
property
that
conference
certainly
did
not
mean
to
negate
the
general
rule
referred
to
in
to
a
house
and
the
senate
report.
i’d
like
to
now
to
turn
to
the
--
assuming
that
the
commission
has
the
power,
was
it
properly
exercised
in
this
case.
now,
both
respondents
here
and
in
their
briefs
talk
about
the
actual
taxes
doctrine
while
the
actual
taxes
doctrine
has
never
been
thought
or
never
been
held
to
preclude
the
commission
from
exercising
its
discrimination
in
how
to
treat
liberalized
tax
depreciation
for
ratemaking
purposes.
it
is
largely
a
question
of
whether
the
taxes
result
in
a
--
whether
the
use
of
liberalize
depreciation
results
in
a
tax
deferral
or
a
tax
savings.
now,
if
we
could
consider
all
of
texas
gas
property
together,
then
we
would
have
a
different
case
than
we
have
here.
then
you
would
continue
assuming
that
texas
gas
continued
to
expand,
you
would
have
--
you
would
have
--
you
would
be
able
to
use
the
benefits
from
the
expansion
property
with
respect
to
the
old
property.
but
congress
made
the
segregation.
congress
said,
“with
respect
to
expansion
property,
you
can
get
off
“flow-through”,
you
can
go
to
straight-line
and
if
you
can
get
the
agencies
approval,
you
can
go
to
normalization.”
so,
congress
segregated
these
types
of
properties.
so
you
cannot
consider
the
tax
benefits
from
the
expansion
property
in
determining
what
method
of
accounting
to
apply
to
the
existing
property
for
ratemaking
purposes.
the
whole
concept
of
normalization
is
that
you
take
the
benefits
and
you
put
them
into
a
reserve
account.
they
are
not
available
for
anything
else.
they
are
in
that
account
so
that
you
can
pay
future
taxes
with
respect
to
that
property.
mr.
samuel
huntington
no,
it’s
a
--
mr.
samuel
huntington
it’s
an
accounting
thing,
but
you
cannot.
those
funds
are
not
available
--
mr.
samuel
huntington
well,
as
far
--
in
other
words,
the
company
is
required
to
maintain
an
account
of
sufficient
size
to
pay
future
taxes
with
respect
to
that
property.
the
--
as
far
as
paying
--
mr.
samuel
huntington
you
collected
it
from
the
--
mr.
samuel
huntington
that’s
right.
mr.
samuel
huntington
well,
for
ratemaking
purpose
the
amount
is
deducted
from
the
rate
base
so
that
it
is
essentially
[voice
overlap]
--
mr.
samuel
huntington
for
ratemaking
purposes
the
--
mr.
samuel
huntington
as
you
actually
paid
and
you
haven’t
paid
--
mr.
samuel
huntington
that’s
right.
but
because
congress
specifically
said,
alright,
you
can
use
this
method
on
expansion
property.
it
is
congress
that
has
made
the
segregation
and
therefore
you
have
to
look
just
at
the
existing
property
in
determining
what
method
to
use
there.
and
there
we
say
the
commission
was
correct
in
determining
that
the
use
of
“flow-through”
was
no
longer
appropriate
and
had
full
discretion
this
is
a
matter
completely
within
the
commission’s
discretion
to
analyze
these
facts
and
make
it
--
mr.
samuel
huntington
it
said
why
i
did
it.
mr.
samuel
huntington
it
did
it
because
with
respect
to
existing
property,
there
were
no
longer
be
sufficient
deductions
to
offset
the
declining
balances
on
the
existing
property
from
year
to
year,
the
tax
depreciation
deductions
would
decline.
therefore,
instead
of
having
a
tax
savings
with
respect
to
that
property
is
merely
a
tax
deferral
to
pass
it
on
in
the
form
of
lower
rates
now
would
simply
mean,
that
present
customers
are
paying
a
tax
expense
which
the
or
getting
a
tax
benefit
at
the
expense
of
future
customers
who
would
then
have
to
pay
the
increase
taxes.
thank
you.
