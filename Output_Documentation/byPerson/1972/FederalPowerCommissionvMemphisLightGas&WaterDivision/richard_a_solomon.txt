mr.
richard
a.
solomon
mr.
chief
justice
and
members
of
the
court.
there
may
be
some
confusion
here
as
to
what
the
issues
in
the
case
are.
there
are
two
issues
in
this
case
and
they
would
put
into
this
case
by
the
united
states.
first
issue
was
whether
the
court
of
appeals
was
correct
in
construing
the
tax
act
as
precluding
the
commission
from
considering
the
request
by
texas
gas.
and
the
second
issue
is
whether
assuming
the
commission
as
authority
--
continuing
authority
to
consider
the
question
whether
it
considered
it
problem.
there’re
two
issues
here.
they’ve
been
put
into
this
case
by
the
united
states
and
they
have
been
accepted
us.
it
is
true
and
only
one
of
them
was
decided
by
the
court
below
that
both
parties
to
this
proceeding
are
suggesting
that
you
can
decide
the
second
issue
if
you
reach
that.
now,
i
haven’t
got
enough
time
to
spend
much
time
on
the
basic
decision
of
the
court
below.
but
i
do
want
to
say
one
thing
in
response
to
justice
white.
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
believe
that
if
the
situation
had
been
left
as
it
was
at
the
time
of
that
senate
report
that
mr.
boland
read
that
the
commission
would’ve
been
precluded.
the
court
of
appeals
decision
is
based
on
the
entire
history
of
what
happened
and
specifically
based
upon
the
limitation
of
the
election
by
the
conference.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
the
report
speaks
to
the
senate
bill
then
before
them,
the
conference
limit
it
and
the
court
of
appeals
thought
that
was
significant
and
i
think
it’s
significant
but
you
have
to
look
at
my
brief
for
that
point
because
i
would
really
if
i
had
a
limited
time
i
have
like
to
go
on
to
the
exercise
of
power
assuming
they
had
any
power.
now
the
united
states
hasn’t
said
very
much
about
this.
they
would
like
you
to
believe
that
discretion
is
the
end
of
the
argument
that
because
an
agency
obviously
has
great
deal
of
discretion
in
general
to
decide
what
the
parameters
of
its
ratemaking
principles
are.
but
if
they
decide
for
“flow-through”
that
that’s
all
what
has
to
be
you
have
to
worry
about
it.
but
if
there
is
one
thing
in
this
complex
tax
law,
which
is
clear,
if
an
agency
chooses
to
fix
the
rights
of
a
utility
on
the
conventional
cost
of
service
basis
it
may
include
a
tax
allowance
but
that
tax
allowance
is
to
be
--
to
the
extent,
it
is
possible
to
calculate
it
the
actual
taxes
paid
and
not
theoretical
tax.
and
when
the
federal
power
commission
and
other
agencies
happen
time
to
time
attempted
to
include
in
the
right
of
the
company
fictitious
tax
allowances.
they
have
been
regularly
smacked
down
by
the
court.
the
problem
with
respect
to
liberalize
depreciation
is
whether
it’s
used
involves
a
tax
deferral
or
a
tax
saving.
if
it
involves
a
tax
deferral,
then
the
actual
taxes
are
not
what
to
you
pay
in
the
particular
year.
the
tax
incurred
is
a
higher
amount
although
you
are
allowed
to
defer
a
part
of
it.
and
under
such
circumstances
it
would
be
appropriate
to
allow
the
normalization.
but
the
fact
of
a
matter
is
that
you
do
not
pay
taxes
on
the
basis
of
the
situation
with
respect
to
individual
pieces
of
property
or
individual
groups
or
property.
you
pay
taxes
on
the
entire
tax
obligation
of
the
regulated
utility
and
from
the
depreciation
standpoint
under
the
depreciation
status
of
the
entire
utility.
and
this
is
what
the
commission
found
in
the
alabama-tennessee
case.
it
means
that
with
respect
to
growing
or
stable
company,
the
lower
taxes
on
the
later
on
later
vintages
of
property
will
be
more
than
sufficient
to
counteract
the
higher
taxes
on
earlier
advantages
of
property
with
the
result
that
you
will
have
a
constantly
growing
tax
surplus.
now,
that’s
what
happened
to
texas
gas,
when
it
was
allowed
to
normalize
prior
to
1967.
as
a
result,
it
comes
in
to
this
case
with
$13
million
of
reserve
which
nobody
can
claim
is
related
to
the
all
of
the
property.
it
will
as
a
result
of
the
right
given
it
by
congress
the
special
right
given
it
by
congress
by
section
441
be
entitle
to
accrue
additional
reserves
which
are
in
fact
interest
free
loans.
and
with
respect
to
new
expansion
property,
but
the
fact
that
is
accruing
additional
interest
free
reserve
has
nothing
whatsoever
to
do
with
whether
or
not
texas
gas
use
of
liberalize
depreciation
on
all
property
and
new
property,
which
is
what’s
being
doing.
we’ll
seize
to
be
a
tax
saving,
it
was
using
liberalize
depreciation
on
all
its
property
and
because
it
was
a
growing
company
it
resulted
in
tax
savings.
it
will
use
liberalize
depreciation
in
the
future
on
all
its
property
and
if
it
is
a
growing
and
stable
country
--
company,
it
will
still
be
a
tax
saving.
now,
what
about
this
gas
supply
shortage
and
everything
like
that?
there
are
areas
for
commission
expertise.
one
area
for
commission
expertise
could
be
a
finding
based
on
evidence,
substantial
evidence
but
certainly
one
you
some
weight
to,
saying
that
the
industry
has
changed
and
this
company
or
other
companies
are
not
going
to
be
growing
companies?
and
therefore,
the
factual
situation
is
change.
if
that
was
the
posture
in
which
this
came
to,
then
you
obviously
unless
the
commission’s
determination
was
clearly
not
based
on
the
record
would
have
a
very
difficult
problem
if
you
want
to
reverse
it.
but
that
is
not
the
problem
the
way
this
case
comes
to.
on
the
contrary,
the
commission
assumed,
they
more
than
assumed,
they
found
an
order
578
that
texas
gas
was
going
to
continue
to
grow.
and
i
am
citing
from
page
110
of
the
record
about
two
lines,
three
lines
below,
the
numeral
27,
47.
and
here’s
what
say,
said
the
commission
this
isn’t
me,
“while
texas
gas
is
pre-1970
properties
may
represent
a
declining
net
investment.
the
company
will
undoubtedly
be
adding
its
entire
rate
base
by
not
post-1969
construction.”
they
didn’t
find
that
gas
supply
shortage
or
any
thing
else
had
changed
the
situation
which
met
this
was
a
tax
savings
rather
tax
deferral.
what
they
found
was
that
because
the
commission
now
has
the
right
--
pardon
me,
because
texas
gas
now
has
the
right
to
keep
a
portion
of
the
tax
savings
i.e.
the
increasing
amount
of
their
new
expansion
property
that
that
somehow
converted
the
situation
from
a
tax
saving
to
a
tax
deferral.
but
we
submit
to
you
that
there
is
nothing
in
the
act,
nothing
in
the
commission’s
rule
and
nothing
in
common
sense
which
says,
that
because
a
company
has
the
temporary
use
of
an
interest
free
loan
that
means
that
it’s
use
of
liberalize
depreciation
is
going
to
become
a
tax
deferral
rather
than
a
tax
saving.
it
only
means
that
if
at
some
unforeseen,
an
unexpected
and
certainly
not
found
on
this
record
future
date.
there
were
some
need
for
use
of
this
fine
and
over
and
beyond
that
the
$13
million
they
already
have
for
use.
if
only
millions
that
there
are
be
additional
ways
of
meeting
this
possible
but
not
found
future
contingency.
so,
our
basic
position
in
this
case
assuming
that
the
court
below
was
wrong
in
saying
that
the
commission
was
precluded
from
considering
this
request
is
that
its
resolution
of
the
matter
was
in
error.
and
if
you
will
read
the
commission’s
decision,
you
will
find
that
it’s
so
reasonably
for
finding
there
is
no
tax
saving
is
this
assumption
that
because
all
of
the
facts
savings
will
be
put
into
this
fund.
they
are
not
available
and
have
to
be
available
in
the
first
place
and
in
the
second
place
if
there
was
necessary,
they
could
be
made
available.
and
the
only
i
think
i’d
like
to
say
is
mr.
huntington
says
that
normalization
has
to
be
put
into
a
reserve
fund.
we
will
grant
that
although
the
house
report
suggests
that
isn’t
true.
but,
there
is
nothing
in
the
--
there
aren’t
anything
else
that
says,
what
it
goes
into
a
fund
it
can’t
be
use
for
future
use.
that’s
what
deferred
taxes
are
for.

future
contingency.
so,
our
basic
position
in
this
case
assuming
that
the
court
below
was
wrong
in
saying
that
the
commission
was
precluded
from
considering
this
request
is
that
its
resolution
of
the
matter
was
in
error.
and
if
you
will
read
the
commission’s
decision,
you
will
find
that
it’s
so
reasonably
for
finding
there
is
no
tax
saving
is
this
assumption
that
because
all
of
the
facts
savings
will
be
put
into
this
fund.
they
are
not
available
and
have
to
be
available
in
the
first
place
and
in
the
second
place
if
there
was
necessary,
they
could
be
made
available.
and
the
only
i
think
i’d
like
to
say
is
mr.
huntington
says
that
normalization
has
to
be
put
into
a
reserve
fund.
we
will
grant
that
although
the
house
report
suggests
that
isn’t
true.
but,
there
is
nothing
in
the
--
there
aren’t
anything
else
that
says,
what
it
goes
into
a
fund
it
can’t
be
use
for
future
use.
that’s
what
deferred
taxes
are
for.
