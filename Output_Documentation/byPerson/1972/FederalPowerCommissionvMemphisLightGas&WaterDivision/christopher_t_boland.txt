mr.
christopher
t.
boland
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
fundamental
error
in
the
court
below
in
this
case
has
to
do
with
whether
or
not
the
election,
which
was
provided
by
the
senate
was
in
addition
to
the
third
rule
of
the
house
of
representatives
or
whether
it
was
in
substitution.
a
careful
reading
of
the
opinion
below
and
on
rehearing
was
showed
that
this
is
where
the
court
fell
in
what
we
claim
to
be
error.
the
position
of
the
respondents
in
this
case
is
that
it’s
a
substitution
in
their
supporting
court
below.
our
position
is
that
it’s
clear
an
additional
method
provided
to
the
taxpayer.
we
think
that
shown
very
clear
in
the
senate
report
in
this
connection
we’ve
set
forth
the
entire
legislative
history
with
respect
to
section
441
of
tax
[voice
overlap].
mr.
christopher
t.
boland
it
isn’t
express
in
terms,
but
it’s
our
feeling
that
congress
had
some
concern
as
to
whether
the
regulatory
agencies
would
permit
a
change
within
the
discretion
of
the
agency
would
permit
a
shift.
mr.
christopher
t.
boland
well,
this
is
clearly
established
in
the
reports
of
both
houses,
your
honor
that
they
were
concerned
about
the
gradual
shift
and
trend
to
“flow-through”
by
companies
that
were
not
on
“flow-through.”
the
biggest
of
which
was
the
telephone
company,
they
were
on
straight-line
depreciation
of
the
federal
communications
commission
was
threatening
to
impute
“flow-through”
for
regulatory
purposes
on
the
tax
consequences
such
an
act
would
be
staggering.
they
were
really
about
the
loss
of
tax
revenues
and
in
the
report
it
shows
that
they
had
not
intended
really
in
passing
the
provisions
of
liberalized
depreciation
in
1954
code
to
have
these
benefits
passed
on
to
the
consumer.
it
was
intended
to
give
the
utilities
working
capital
in
order
to
invest
a
new
plant.
mr.
christopher
t.
boland
well,
and
this
suggestion
was
made
your
honor
by
the
then
chairman
of
the
federal
power
commission
chairman
white
and
in
the
report
it
shows
that
the
congress
is
turning
that
down
because
of
the
objection
of
several
of
the
agencies
where
a
competitive
situations
would
put
the
utility
at
a
competitive
disadvantage.
they
were
also
concerned
about
the
fact
that
this
would
be
mandatory
and
would
create
widespread
rate
increases,
all
utilities.
mr.
christopher
t.
boland
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
christopher
t.
boland
i
think
the
report
is
clearly
established
that.
they
make
it
pretty
clear
that
they
were
concerned
and
specifically
--
mr.
christopher
t.
boland
but
they
had
a
dilemma
so
to
speak.
on
the
one
hand
they
were
--
mr.
christopher
t.
boland
well,
they
were
leaving
it
to
the
discretion
of
the
regulatory
agencies
individually.
mr.
christopher
t.
boland
well,
no
your
honor.
some
of
them
were
the
federal
power
commission
position
was
fairly
clear.
mr.
christopher
t.
boland
that’s
this
case,
but
the
legislative
history
shows
that
the
state
commissions
were
about
equally
divided
between
“flow-through”
and
normalization.
and
as
circumstances
might
change
for
example,
here
we’re
confronted
the
natural
gas
industry,
this
court
knows
fully
well
that
if
we
got
a
gas
shortage,
you
just
had
louisiana
power
and
light
case
here.
and
this
is
one
of
the
fundamental
premises
that
the
commission
had
when
they
originally
directed
“flow-through”
in
the
alabama-tennessee
case.
they
anticipated
the
continued
expansion
of
the
gas
industry
and
with
recognition
the
gas
reserves
were
here
the
less
beyond
the
year
2000.
well,
here
we
are
short
of
1973
and
the
very
premise
that
the
federal
power
commission
had
anticipated
this
falling
by
the
waste
time
yet
under
the
decision,
the
court
below,
we
would
be
forever
barred
from
changing
from
“flow-through”,
notwithstanding
the
change
in
the
fundamental
principle
and
concept
--
the
basic
premises
of
federal
power
commission.
but,
it
is
clearly
shown
that
the
suggestion
had
been
made
to
make
it
mandatory
that
no
utility
could
use
liberalized
appreciation
from
this
point
forward
and
they
turned
that
down
because
of
what
it
might
do
competitively.
mr.
christopher
t.
boland
and
the
widespread
rate
increase.
it
would
be
automatic.
all
utilities
involved
would
have
to
increase
their
rates.
now
that
there
might
be
some
unique
situations
like
texas
gas
where
texas
gas
had
a
rate
increase
on
file
where
we
had
requested
within
the
discretion
of
the
federal
power
commission
to
go
to
straight-line
depreciation.
the
tax
consequences
the
rate
level
to
the
consumers
is
exactly
the
same
as
normalization.
as
a
matter
of
fact
under
the
commission’s
decision
is
little
lower
because
they
deduct
the
reserve
from
the
rate
basely,
you
do
get
a
lower
rate.
mr.
christopher
t.
boland
no,
not
except
in
one
respect,
they
do
make
a
comment
that
they
do
not
intend
to
preclude
the
agency’s
discretion
from
deducting
the
reserve
under
normalization
from
the
rate
base.
mr.
christopher
t.
boland
no,
in
the
strict
sentence,
the
rate
basis
the
plant
invested
utility
whereas
here
we
are
talking
about
an
item
of
costs
of
service
and
expense,
which
is
part
of
cost
of
service.
the
tax
expenses
included
in
the
cost
of
service.
the
only
item
in
cost
of
service
that
directly
relates
the
rate
base
is
return.
i
suppose
depreciation,
but
depreciation
is
also
relates
to
rate
basis.
but
other
than
an
that
you
got
operating
maintenance
expenses,
you
got
federal
income
taxes,
state
taxes,
ad
valorem
taxes,
which
goes
to
totality
of
the
cost-of-service
when
which
the
rate
is
based.
but
if
you
were
turn
to
page
82
and
83
of
our
main
brief
for
where
set
that
the
legislative
history
of
this
entire
act
and
if
you
look
at
the
lower
portion
of
page
82,
this
is
the
key
to
the
whole
decision
of
the
court
below.
both
the
house
bill
and
the
committee
--
this
is
senate
report
--
mr.
christopher
t.
boland
i'm
reading
from
page
82
of
your
main
brief
--
the
white
brief
which
is
part
of
our
appendix
and
at
the
bottom,
the
last
paragraph
on
the
bottom
and
this
is
the
senate
report.
senate
report
is
here
making
clear
both
the
house
bill
and
the
committee
amendments,
that
is
the
senate
committee
amendment
that
they’re
sponsoring
provide
that
in
the
case
of
existing
property,
the
following
rules
are
to
apply
--
the
following
rules
to
be
apply.
the
third
rule
is
shown
on
page
83,
if
a
tax
payer
is
taking
accelerated
depreciation
and
“flow-through”
to
its
customers,
the
benefits
of
the
deferred
taxes
and
the
taxpayer
would
continue
to
do
so
wherein
except
this
provide
under
the
committee
amendments
which
are
discussed
below
close
for
in,
unless,
the
appropriate
regulatory
agency
permits
the
change
as
to
that
property.
mr.
christopher
t.
boland
yes.
what
the
respondents
would
do
your
honor,
is
have
as
just
right
that
out
of
the
report.
they
ignore
it.
they
attempt
to
make
no
explanation
as
to
what
happened
to
that
language?
here
is
firm
clear
language,
the
senate
to
say
and
this
is
identical
except
for
the
parenthetical
to
the
third
rule
in
the
house
as
to
which
the
court
below
said
that
if
the
house
bill
have
been
passed,
the
commission
and
texas
gas
wouldn’t
been
clearly
justified
in
doing
what
was
done.
but
here
in
the
senate
report
is
precisely
the
same
provision
and
they
present
from
it,
they
disregard
it
as
so
it
isn’t
there
and
somehow
the
election
that
was
provided
by
the
senate
is
suppose
to
expunge
this
from
the
report.
but
we
don’t
see
it
expunge.
it’s
right
there
in
black
and
white.
now,
the
parenthetical,
you
might
ask,
what
does
the
parenthetical
refer
to?
the
parenthetical
refers
to
the
fact
and
as
you
will
see
if
you
follow
on
page
84,
they’re
referring
to
one
principal
difference.
the
committee
amendments
while
in
most
respects
the
same
as
the
house
provision
differ
in
one
principal
area.
the
amendments
permit
an
election
to
be
made
within
180
days.
so,
it
seems
to
be
perfectly
obvious
that
when
they
came
out
to
the
house,
the
third
rule
was
there,
they
all
agree
with
the
third
rule.
the
court
below
said
had
that
been
the
law,
we
would’ve
been
[voice
overlap].
mr.
christopher
t.
boland
oh,
yes,
under
the
third
rule,
you
need
the
consent
of
the
commission.
mr.
christopher
t.
boland
oh,
yes,
sir.
yes,
sir.
mr.
christopher
t.
boland
are
you
on
page
83?
mr.
christopher
t.
boland
82?
well,
if
you
go
over
to
83,
the
third
rule
is
at
the
top
of
the
page
on
83.
it’s
right
up
in
173.
now,
if
you
look
at
the
last
part
of
that
it
says,
“unless
the
appropriate
regulatory
agency
permits
a
change
as
to
that
property.”
in
other
words,
somebody
was
on
“flow-through”
like
texas
gas
was
that
we
would
continue
on
“flow-through”
under
the
third
rule,
unless
the
appropriate
regulatory
agency
permits
the
changes
for
that
property.
and
that’s
exactly
what’s
happened
here,
the
federal
power
commission
has
permitted
the
change
and
this
is
precisely
the
same
language
is
in
the
house.
again,
and
i
reemphasize
that
the
court
below
said,
that
under
the
house
language,
this
rule
would
have
--
mr.
christopher
t.
boland
at
the
tail-end
of
the
third
rule
on
page
83.
it
says,
unless
the
appropriate
regulatory
agency
permits
the
change
as
to
that
property.
mr.
christopher
t.
boland
oh
no,
no
it
was
not
required,
but
this
is
the
discretion.
the
whole
argument
before
this
court
is,
did
the
election
submerge,
obliterate
the
discretion
which
the
federal
power
commission
had
thereto
for
clearly
had
under
all
of
the
court
decisions
to
decide
what
method
of
tax
depreciation
should
be
use
for
cost
of
services
and
rates.
and
we
say
that
under
this
language
in
the
senate
report
that
the
house
version
survive
the
election,
it’s
a
separate
thing,
it’s
not
an
absolute
right
as
the
election
is.
it
needs
that
permission
of
the
commission,
it
was
granted
in
this
case
and
we
submit
properly
so.
my
time
is
up,
thank
you.
mr.
christopher
t.
boland
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
fundamental
error
in
the
court
below
in
this
case
has
to
do
with
whether
or
not
the
election,
which
was

the

of
representatives
or
whether
it
was
in
substitution.
a
careful

of
the

and
on

was
showed
that
this
is
where
the

be
error.
the
position
of
the
respondents
in
this

is
that
it’s
a
substitution
in
their
supporting
court
below.
our
position
is
that
it’s
clear
an
additional
method
provided
to
the
taxpayer.
we
think
that
shown

relates
the
rate
base
is
return.
i
suppose
depreciation,
but
depreciation
is
also
relates
to
rate
basis.
but
other
than
an
that
you
got
operating
maintenance
expenses,
you
got
federal
income
taxes,
state
taxes,
ad
valorem
taxes,
which
goes
to
totality
of
the
cost-of-service
when
which
the
rate
is
based.
but
if
you
were
turn
to
page
82
and
83
of
our
main
brief
for
where
set
that
the
legislative
history
of
this
entire
act
and
if
you
look
at
the
lower
portion
of
page
82,
this
is
the
key
to
the
whole
decision
of
the
court
below.
both
the
house
bill
and
the
committee
--
this
is
senate
report
--
mr.
christopher
t.
boland
i'm
reading
from
page
82
of
your
main
brief
--
the
white
brief
which
is
part
of
our
appendix
and
at
the
bottom,
the
last
paragraph
on
the
bottom
and
this
is
the
senate
report.
senate
report
is
here
making
clear
both
the
house
bill
and
the
committee
amendments,
that
is
the
senate
committee
amendment
that
they’re
sponsoring
provide
that
in
the
case
of
existing
property,
the
following
rules
are
to
apply
--
the
following
rules
to
be
apply.
the
third
rule
is
shown
on
page
83,
if
a
tax
payer
is
taking
accelerated
depreciation
and
“flow-through”
to
its
customers,
the
benefits
of
the
deferred
taxes
and
the
taxpayer
would
continue
to
do
so
wherein
except
this
provide
under
the
committee
amendments
which
are
discussed
below
close
for
in,
unless,
the
appropriate
regulatory
agency
permits
the
change
as
to
that
property.
mr.
christopher
t.
boland
yes.
what
the
respondents
would
do
your
honor,
is
have
as
just
right
that
out
of
the
report.
they
ignore
it.
they
attempt
to
make
no
explanation
as
to
what
happened
to
that
language?
here
is
firm
clear
language,
the
senate
to
say
and
this
is
identical
except
for
the
parenthetical
to
the
third
rule
in
the
house
as
to
which
the
court
below
said
that
if
the
house
bill
have
been
passed,
the
commission
and
texas
gas
wouldn’t
been
clearly
justified
in
doing
what
was
done.
but
here
in
the
senate
report
is
precisely
the
same
provision
and
they
present
from
it,
they
disregard
it
as
so
it
isn’t
there
and
somehow
the
election
that
was
provided
by
the
senate
is
suppose
to
expunge
this
from
the
report.
but
we
don’t
see
it
expunge.
it’s
right
there
in
black
and
white.
now,
the
parenthetical,
you
might
ask,
what
does
the
parenthetical
refer
to?
the
parenthetical
refers
to
the
fact
and
as
you
will
see
if
you
follow
on
page
84,
they’re
referring
to
one
principal
difference.
the
committee
amendments
while
in
most
respects
the
same
as
the
house
provision
differ
in
one
principal
area.
the
amendments
permit
an
election
to
be
made
within
180
days.
so,
it
seems
to
be
perfectly
obvious
that
when
they
came
out
to
the
house,
the
third
rule
was
there,
they
all
agree
with
the
third
rule.
the
court
below
said
had
that
been
the
law,
we
would’ve
been
[voice
overlap].
mr.
christopher
t.
boland
oh,
yes,
under
the
third
rule,
you
need
the
consent
of
the
commission.
mr.
christopher
t.
boland
oh,
yes,
sir.
yes,
sir.
mr.
christopher
t.
boland
are
you
on
page
83?
mr.
christopher
t.
boland
82?
well,
if
you
go
over
to
83,
the
third
rule
is
at
the
top
of
the
page
on
83.
it’s
right
up
in
173.
now,
if
you
look
at
the
last
part
of
that
it
says,
“unless
the
appropriate
regulatory
agency
permits
a
change
as
to
that
property.”
in
other
words,
somebody
was
on
“flow-through”
like
texas
gas
was
that
we
would
continue
on
“flow-through”
under
the
third
rule,
unless
the
appropriate
regulatory
agency
permits
the
changes
for
that
property.
and
that’s
exactly
what’s
happened
here,
the
federal
power
commission
has
permitted
the
change
and
this
is
precisely
the
same
language
is
in
the
house.
again,
and
i
reemphasize
that
the
court
below
said,
that
under
the
house
language,
this
rule
would
have
--
mr.
christopher
t.
boland
at
the
tail-end
of
the
third
rule
on
page
83.
it
says,
unless
the
appropriate
regulatory
agency
permits
the
change
as
to
that
property.
mr.
christopher
t.
boland
oh
no,
no
it
was
not
required,
but
this
is
the
discretion.
the
whole
argument
before
this
court
is,
did
the
election
submerge,
obliterate
the
discretion
which
the
federal
power
commission
had
thereto
for
clearly
had
under
all
of
the
court
decisions
to
decide
what
method
of
tax
depreciation
should
be
use
for
cost
of
services
and
rates.
and
we
say
that
under
this
language
in
the
senate
report
that
the
house
version
survive
the
election,
it’s
a
separate
thing,
it’s
not
an
absolute
right
as
the
election
is.
it
needs
that
permission
of
the
commission,
it
was
granted
in
this
case
and
we
submit
properly
so.
my
time
is
up,
thank
you.
