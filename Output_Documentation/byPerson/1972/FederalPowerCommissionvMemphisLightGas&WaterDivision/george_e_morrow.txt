mr.
george
e.
morrow
may
it
please
--
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
agree
with
the
--
with
counsel
for
the
government,
mr.
huntington
that
the
issues
in
this
case
arise
primarily
under
the
tax
reform
act
of
1969.
the
question
that
the
court
of
--
the
commission
has
found
that
that
act
required
one
result.
the
court
of
appeals
has
found
that
the
act
required
another
result.
really,
the
question
in
this
case
is
which
of
those
two
results
is
in
conformity
with
the
purpose
and
intent
of
congress
in
enacting
the
tax
reform
act
of
1969?
specifically,
was
it
the
intent
and
purpose
of
congress
in
enacting
that
act
to
bring
about
a
drastic
and
immediate
change
in
the
depreciation
practices
of
most
of
the
utilities
in
this
country?
a
change
which
would
result
in
prompt,
substantial,
widespread
rate
increases.
the
court
of
appeals,
the
result
reached
by
the
court
of
appeals
is
that
this
was
not
the
intent
of
congress.
the
result
of
the
court
of
appeals
allows
the
utilities
to
take
normalize
depreciation
with
respect
to
their
expansion
property,
but
it
leaves
the
rest
of
the
property
exactly
the
way
it
was
before
with
the
same
tax
practices
in
effect
as
before.
this
is
precisely
what
congress
intended,
you
can
see
that
from
that
phase
of
the
act
and
even
more
clearly
it
appears
in
the
legislative
history
of
the
act.
first,
the
act
itself
specifically
provides
as
counsel
has
pointed
out
for
the
election
with
respect
to
post
1969
expansion
property.
but
let
me
pause
right
here
to
point
out
that
the
act
very
narrowly
defines
post
1969
expansion
property.
it
is
only
that
property
acquired
after
1969,
which
does
not
replace
existing
property
and
which
increases
the
operating
of
productive
capacity
of
the
utility.
now,
in
the
case
of
the
pipeline
industry,
that
means
that
this
expansion
property
starting
at
flat
zero
in
1970
will
grow
and
because
of
the
gas
shortage
which
is
mentioned
by
counsel,
this
expansion
property
will
probably
grow
very
slowly.
so,
the
election
with
respect
to
expansion
property
will
have
very
little
practical
tax
effect
or
rate
effect
for
a
long
time
in
the
future.
if
that’s
what’s
been
lax
on
by
the
commission,
it’s
a
very
stubby
tail
to
wag
a
very
large
dog.
the
tax
act
also
expressly
provides
for
the
retention
of
“flow-through”
depreciation
with
respect
to
property
to
companies
that
have
been
using
it
on
the
past.
it
twice
with
respect
of
pre-1969
and
with
respect
--
i
mean
pre-1970
and
post
1969
properties
specially
provides
the
companies
that
have
been
“flowing
through”
may
continue
to
“flow-through.”
the
court
of
appeals
reached
exactly
the
same
result.
now,
the
legislative
history
makes
it
clear
that
this
was
all
that
congress
intended
to
do,
this
and
nothing
else.
i
think
i'm
agreeing
with
my
brothers
on
the
other
side
concerning
the
reason
for
the
passage
of
this
act.
the
utility
commissions
over
the
country
have
been
trending
toward
“flow-through”
requiring
their
utilities
to
go
to
“flow-through”
because
this
was
the
way
that
you
minimize
utility
rates.
you
made
the
companies
pay
--
charge
their
rates
on
the
same
basis
that
they
paid
their
taxes.
you
didn’t
give
them
any
fictitious
tax
in
there
like
normalization
does.
the
only
thing
wrong
with
this
from
the
treasury’s
point
of
view
was
that
as
mr.
huntington
said,
it
also
reduces
the
taxes
paid
by
the
companies.
and
the
committee
had
found
that
it
would
soon
result
in
loss
of
a
billion
dollars-and-a-half
to
maybe
$2
billion
to
the
federal
treasury.
what
to
about
that
loss?
the
solution
is
proposed
to
the
house
was
to
freeze
current
tax
situation
--
current
depreciation
practices
right
where
they
were.
the
trend
to
us
toward
“flow-through”,
freeze
it.
stop
it
right
there,
and
that
was
all
they
proposed
to
do.
they
did
not
propose
to
reverse
the
river
but
just
to
freeze
it
right
where
it
was.
mr.
george
e.
morrow
permits
the
change
as
to
that
property?
or
it
says
the
right
that
the
appropriate
regulatory
agency?
your
honor,
there
might
be
some
circumstances
under
which
a
regulatory
agency
should
take
a
utility
all
for
“flow-through”
and
put
it
on
to
some
other
kind
of
depreciation.
“flow-through”
depreciation
works
--
the
principle
works
when
a
utility
is
in
and
expanding
or
stable
condition
as
long
as
its
plant
is
expanding
a
stable
to
“flow-through”
proposition
works.
if
a
plant
were
winding
down,
then
it
would
be
appropriate
for
the
regulatory
commission
to
take
it
all
“flow-through.”
so,
there
are
circumstances
and
which
the
regulatory
commission
should
do
that.
mr.
george
e.
morrow
well,
i'm
just
saying
that
this
applies
not
only
to
federal
power
commission,
but
it
applies
to
all
the
regulatory
[voice
overlap].
mr.
george
e.
morrow
oh,
yes
sir,
yes
sir
it
includes
that.
but
the
federal
power
commission
and
the
court
of
appeals
recognized
that
there
might
be
circumstances
under
which
a
change
from
“flow-through”
would
be
justified
and
i
think
that’s
all
that
the
--
this
reference
has
do
with
it.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
on
the
face
of
the
act
itself,
there
is
no
such
provision
about
a
regulatory
agency
permitting
the
change.
you
don’t
find
that
in
the
act,
that’s
just
a
comment
on
the
part
of
the
people
who
were
working
on
the
act.
mr.
george
e.
morrow
but,
yes
your
honor.
mr.
george
e.
morrow
but
your
honor,
congress
have
two
concerns
of
equal
value
to
it
at
that
time.
one
of
the
concerns
was
that
we
stopped
the
trend
to
flow-through.
mr.
george
e.
morrow
the
other
concern
was
that
we
do
it
without
creating
widespread
prompt
substantial
rate
--
utility
rate
increase.
now,
this
--
mr.
george
e.
morrow
we
believe
that
it
had
no
discretion
to
do
what
it
did
in
this
case,
your
honor,
that’s
right.
mr.
george
e.
morrow
not
under
the
circumstances
of
the
state.
mr.
george
e.
morrow
no,
your
honor.
i
don’t
say
that,
i
say
that
that
piece
of
legislative
history
has
its
place
under
a
proper
fact
situation
but
this
is
not
the
fact
situation.
mr.
george
e.
morrow
under
the
circumstances
of
this
case,
the
commission
had
no
discretion
to
do
what
it
did.
mr.
george
e.
morrow
yes,
your
honor.
and
it
said
so
on
two
bases.
first,
on
its
reading
of
the
act
itself
and
secondly,
on
the
proposition
that
the
federal
power
commission
has
an
absolute
legal
duty
to
allow
in
cost
of
service
nothing
more
than
actual
taxes
--
the
real
tax
expense.
and
this
we
say
is
the
principle
that
was
violated
by
the
federal
power
commission
in
this
case
and
that’s
why
the
commission
is
wrong.
mr.
george
e.
morrow
your
honor,
i'm
not
saying
that
rule
3
is
of
course,
it’s
not
wrong
it’s
the
law.
mr.
george
e.
morrow
no,
sir.
thank
you
mr.
justice
stewart.
it
doesn’t
because
there
are
circumstances
under
which
it
might
be
proper
for
a
utility
commission
to
move
a
company
of
a
“flow-through”
and
then
--
mr.
george
e.
morrow
your
honor,
--
mr.
george
e.
morrow
i
believe
that
under
the
circumstances
of
this
case,
--
mr.
george
e.
morrow
alright,
here’s
what
the
--
well,
alright.
what
the
commission
wants
to
do
in
this
case
and
may
i
say
something
before
i
get
into
that
definite
if
you
want
to
get
to
that.
mr.
george
e.
morrow
but
you
see
in
the
course
of
the
legislation,
the
passage
of
the
legislation
through
congress,
first,
chairman
white
of
the
commission
came
up
to
congress
and
said,
we’d
like
to
have
it
everything
just
put
on
straight-line
depreciation.
the
congress
turned
down
that
request
for
the
reason
that
in
addition
that
the
one
mentioned
by
mr.
boland
for
the
reason
that
to
put
everybody
on
straight-line
would
result
in
prompt
substantial
widespread
utility
rate
increases.
and
congress
did
not
want
prompt
rate
increases
to
come
into
effect
and
so
they
turned
him
down.
now,
mr.
justice
white,
if
the
commission
should
win
this
case
under
the
commission’s
decision
in
this
case
we
reached
almost
exactly
the
same
situation
that
we
would
have
reach
under
chairman
white’s
suggestion.
the
utilities
would
charge
their
rates
on
the
basis
of
straight-line
depreciation,
but
pay
their
taxes
on
the
basis
of
accelerated
depreciation.
and
for
right
purposes,
you
would
in
a
fact
have
straight-line
depreciation.
it’s
not
quite
the
same
but
it’s
almost
the
same
and
this
is
what
chairman
white
suggested
and
this
is
what
they
turned
down.
now,
when
they
did
that,
they
thought
that
they
had
accomplished
their
purpose
without
putting
any
rate
--
in
any
law
into
effect
which
would
cause
rate
increases
in
the
utilities.
they
said
that
the
bill
would
forestall
the
revenue
loss
which
the
continuation
of
existing
trends
would
make
almost
inevitable.
and
that
it
would
do
so
“in
a
way
which
with
very
few
exceptions
will
require
no
increase
in
utility
rates
because
of
the
tax
laws.
mr.
george
e.
morrow
your
honor,
i
believe
that
it
was
the
intent
of
congress
to
accomplish
the
“freeze”
and
to
accomplish
it
in
such
a
way
as
to
avoid
rate
increases.
i
believe
that
the
action
of
the
commission
not
only
“unfreezes”
but
it
drastically
revolutionizes
utility
practices
and
does
so
in
a
way
which
causes
rate
increases.
in
other
words,
the
result
reached
by
the
commission
is
precisely
the
opposite
of
the
result
which
congress
saw.
now,
let
me
point
this
out,
when
the
bill
got
into
the
senate,
someone
in
the
senate
suggested,
let’s
give
the
pipelines
or
the
utility
the
power
or
election
to
change
to
away
from
--
to
abolish
“flow-through”
depreciation
with
respect
to
all
the
properties.
abolish
“flow-through”
with
respect
to
all
the
properties.
now,
if
that
had
happened,
you
would
have
almost
exactly
the
same
situation
that
you
have
under
the
act
as
it
was
passed
--
i
mean
under
the
act
that
was
construed
by
the
commission.
the
commission
says,
this
little
--
the
election
with
respect
to
expansion
property
puts
us
in
a
position
where
for
all
practical
purposes
we
got
to
allow
the
pipeline
to
go
on
and
normalizes
to
all
its
properties.
we
have
no
alternative,
that’s
the
commission’s
position
in
this
case.
we
are
force
into
it
by
the
practicalities
of
the
situation.
so
what
the
commission
is
saying
that
an
election
with
respect
to
the
expansion
properties
is
tantamount
for
all
practical
purposes
to
an
election
with
respect
to
all
properties.
this
is
precisely
what
the
senate
proposed
to
put
in
the
act
and
which
the
congress
turned
down.
so,
twice
this
matter
was
considered,
twice
the
congress
turned
it
down.
the
commission
has
now
reached
the
very
result
which
congress
turned
down.
let
me
address
myself
to
the
reason
why
i
think
that
the
commission
does
not
have
the
discretion
to
do
what
it
did.
first
--
mr.
george
e.
morrow
well
--
mr.
george
e.
morrow
no,
alright.
let’s
talk
about
in
terms
of
the
commission’s
power.
the
commission
is
under
the
duty
as
the
court
below
said
that
to
allow
a
tax
cost
in
the
cost
of
service
which
is
no
greater
than
actual
taxes.
the
court
says
this,
there’s
nothing
in
the
tax
reform
act
of
1969
which
modifies
the
commission’s
duty
under
the
natural
gas
act
to
require
regulated
utilities
companies
such
as
texas
gas
to
set
rates
which
reflect
actually
expenditures
with
respect
to
such
property
--
the
set
rates
which
reflect
actual
expenditure.
now,
the
commission
does
not
have
discretion
then
to
grant
a
utility,
a
tax
allowance
and
its
cost
of
service.
it
doesn’t
have
power
to
grant
a
utility
and
allowance
and
its
cost
of
service
for
taxes
which
are
not
paid.
in
other
words,
it
does
not
have
the
power
to
treat
as
a
cost
something
which
in
fact
is
not
a
cost.
mr.
george
e.
morrow
that’s
right
your
honor.
that
is
the
law
under
the
natural
gas
act
as
the
court
of
appeals
held
and
as
this
court
held
in
united
u.s.
pipeline
versus
fpc,
which
was
a
tax
case
and
which
mr.
justice
white
is
familiar
with.
in
that
case,
the
court
said
that
the
commission
have
the
power
and
the
duty
to
limit
the
cost
of
service
to
real
expenses.
now,
in
this
case,
texas
gas
is
normalization
on
its
little
tag
of
expansion
property
is
not
going
to
increase
its
depreciation,
not
under
decrease
it’s
the
depreciation
by
one
dime.
now
or
ever,
it’s
not
going
to
increase
its
income
taxes
with
respect
to
depreciation
by
one
dime
now
or
ever.
the
only
effect
that
it
will
have
or
to
be
put
more
money
in
texas
gas’
pockets.
texas
gas
gets
to
charge
a
higher
rate
because
of
normalization
with
respect
to
this
little
piece
of
expansion
property
and
it
gets
to
pocket
the
difference.
and
the
commission
is
in
the
position
of
saying
that
because
texas
gas
gets
increase
revenues
due
--
with
respect
to
its
expansion
property.
therefore,
in
order
to
keep
it
even,
in
order
to
keep
it
whole
it’s
got
to
get
increase
revenues
on
a
large
scale
with
respect
to
its
$600
million
worth
of
depreciable
rate
base.
there
is
no
increase
in
texas
gas’
taxes
as
a
result
of
it’s
going
to
normalize
depreciation
on
its
expansion
property.
therefore,
we
say
that
the
commission
had
no
power
to
give
it
an
additional
return
or
an
additional
amount
in
its
cost
of
service
to
do
this.
we
say
that
if
we
do.
that
if
you
do,
you
have
accomplished
precisely
what
congress
was
attempting
to
avoid.
congress
said,
let’s
freeze
the
situation
and
avoid
tax
rate
increases.
the
effect
of
the
commission’s
decision
is
to
unfreeze
the
situation
and
drastically
change
tax
practices
and
do
so
at
the
cost
of
hundreds
of
millions
of
dollars
of
utility
rate
increases
throughout
the
united
states.
mr.
george
e.
morrow
your
honor,
this
is
just
an
illustration.
the
whole
concept
and
i'm
sure
your
honor
knows
because
you
are
on
the
panhandle
case
in
the
city
of
chicago
case.
the
whole
concept
of
normalized
depreciation
is
that
it
works
when
the
company
is
in
an
expanding
condition
or
its
depreciable
base
is
at
least
stable,
then
the
principle
flow-through
depreciation
where
your
new
properties
coming
in
all
set
your
old
properties
which
are
declining
in
value,
that
principle
works.
it
would
not
work
with
the
pipeline
which
because
of
the
gas
shortage
or
whatever
was
winding
down
its
activities.
and
therefore,
if
a
corporate
--
if
the
tax
utility
or
particular
a
pipeline
were
caught
in
the
winding
down
condition
where
its
depreciable
property
was
actually
decreasing,
then
this
would
not
be
applicable.
but
let
me
point
out
that
there
is
not
one
shred
of
evidence
in
this
case.
not
a
shred
of
evidence
that
texas
gas’
property
is
going
to
be
--
is
going
to
wind
down
or
decrease.
as
a
matter
of
fact
there
is
the
question
of
normalization
was
never
even
considered
in
the
trial
of
this
case.
texas
gas
didn’t
ask
for
it
when
it
filed
its
return,
nobody
put
in
any
evidence
on
it.
there’s
not
a
shred
of
evidence
in
this
case
about
the
effects
of
normalization
on
texas
gas.
so,
we
say
that
what
the
commission
has
done,
is
to
--
your
honor,
i
thought
i
was
given
a
light
if
i
overstepped
my
colleagues.
mr.
george
e.
morrow
i
was
going
to
be
given
a
white
light
and
i
didn’t
see
it.
i
hope
i
haven’t
overstepped
my
colleagues’
time
because
i
was
supposed
to
leave.
mr.
george
e.
morrow
thank
you
your
honor.
i
will
just
summarize
by
saying
this.
that
congress
had
a
specific
problem
in
mind.
the
problem
was
to
avoid
further
tax
losses
is
by
stemming
the
flow
toward
“flow-through.”
it
had
two
purposes
in
mind,
the
other
one
was
to
do
so
without
causing
utility
rate
increases.
the
result
reached
by
the
commission
in
this
case
causes
enormous
utility
rate
increases
all
over
the
country.
the
result
reached
by
the
court
of
appeals
causes
no
increases
and
exactly
coincides
with
the
intent
and
purpose
of
congress.
thank
you.
mr.
george
e.
morrow
may
it
please
--
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
agree
with
the
--
with
counsel
for
the
government,
mr.
huntington
that
the
issues
in
this
case
arise
primarily
under
the
tax
reform
act
of
1969.
the
question
that
the
court
of
--
the
commission
has
found
that
that
act
required
one
result.
the
court
of
appeals
has
found
that
the
act
required
another
result.
really,
the
question
in
this
case
is
which
of
those
two
results
is
in
conformity
with
the
purpose
and
intent
of
congress
in
enacting
the
tax
reform
act
of
1969?
specifically,
was
it
the
intent
and
purpose
of
congress
in
enacting
that
act
to
bring
about
a
drastic
and
immediate
change
in
the
depreciation
practices
of
most
of
the
utilities
in
this
country?
a
change
which
would
result
in
prompt,
substantial,
widespread
rate
increases.
the
court
of
appeals,
the
result
reached
by
the
court
of
appeals
is
that
this
was
not
the
intent
of
congress.
the
result
of
the
court
of
appeals
allows
the
utilities
to
take
normalize
depreciation
with
respect
to
their
expansion
property,
but
it
leaves
the
rest
of
the
property
exactly
the
way
it
was
before
with
the
same
tax
practices
in
effect
as
before.
this
is
precisely
what
congress
intended,
you
can
see
that
from
that
phase
of
the
act
and
even
more
clearly
it
appears
in
the
legislative
history
of
the
act.
first,
the
act
itself
specifically
provides
as
counsel
has
pointed
out
for
the
election
with
respect
to
post
1969
expansion
property.
but
let
me
pause
right
here
to
point
out
that
the
act
very
narrowly
defines
post
1969
expansion
property.
it
is
only
that
property
acquired
after
1969,
which
does
not
replace
existing
property
and
which
increases
the
operating
of
productive
capacity
of
the
utility.
now,
in
the
case
of
the
pipeline
industry,
that
means
that
this
expansion
property
starting
at
flat
zero
in
1970
will
grow
and
because
of
the
gas
shortage
which
is
mentioned
by
counsel,
this
expansion
property
will
probably
grow
very
slowly.
so,
the
election
with
respect
to
expansion
property
will
have
very
little
practical
tax
effect
or
rate
effect
for
a
long
time
in
the
future.
if
that’s
what’s
been
lax
on
by
the
commission,
it’s
a
very
stubby
tail
to
wag
a
very
large
dog.
the
tax
act
also
expressly
provides
for
the
retention
of
“flow-through”
depreciation
with
respect
to
property
to
companies
that
have
been
using
it
on
the
past.
it
twice
with
respect
of
pre-1969
and
with
respect
--
i
mean
pre-1970
and
post
1969
properties
specially
provides
the
companies
that
have
been
“flowing
through”
may
continue
to
“flow-through.”
the
court
of
appeals
reached
exactly
the
same
result.
now,
the
legislative
history
makes
it
clear
that
this
was
all
that
congress
intended
to
do,
this
and
nothing
else.
i
think
i'm
agreeing
with
my
brothers
on
the
other
side
concerning
the
reason
for
the
passage
of
this
act.
the
utility
commissions
over
the
country
have
been
trending
toward
“flow-through”
requiring
their
utilities
to
go
to
“flow-through”
because
this
was
the
way
that
you
minimize
utility
rates.
you
made
the
companies
pay
--
charge
their
rates
on
the
same
basis
that
they
paid
their
taxes.
you
didn’t
give
them
any
fictitious
tax
in
there
like
normalization
does.
the
only
thing
wrong
with
this
from
the
treasury’s
point
of
view
was
that
as
mr.
huntington
said,
it
also
reduces
the
taxes
paid
by
the
companies.
and
the
committee
had
found
that
it
would
soon
result
in
loss
of
a
billion
dollars-and-a-half
to
maybe
$2
billion
to
the
federal
treasury.
what
to
about
that
loss?
the
solution
is
proposed
to
the
house
was
to
freeze
current
tax
situation
--
current
depreciation
practices
right
where
they
were.
the
trend
to
us
toward
“flow-through”,
freeze
it.
stop
it
right
there,
and
that
was
all
they
proposed
to
do.
they
did
not
propose
to
reverse
the
river
but
just
to
freeze
it
right
where
it
was.
mr.
george
e.
morrow
permits
the
change
as
to
that
property?
or
it
says
the
right
that
the
appropriate
regulatory
agency?
your
honor,
there
might
be
some
circumstances
under
which
a
regulatory
agency
should
take
a
utility
all
for
“flow-through”
and
put
it
on
to
some
other
kind
of
depreciation.
“flow-through”
depreciation
works
--
the
principle
works
when
a
utility
is
in
and
expanding
or
stable
condition
as
long
as
its
plant
is
expanding
a
stable
to
“flow-through”
proposition
works.
if
a
plant
were
winding
down,
then
it
would
be
appropriate
for
the
regulatory
commission
to
take
it
all
“flow-through.”
so,
there
are
circumstances
and
which
the
regulatory
commission
should
do
that.
mr.
george
e.
morrow
well,
i'm
just
saying
that
this
applies
not
only
to
federal
power
commission,
but
it
applies
to
all
the
regulatory
[voice
overlap].
mr.
george
e.
morrow
oh,
yes
sir,
yes
sir
it
includes
that.
but
the
federal
power
commission
and
the
court
of
appeals
recognized
that
there
might
be
circumstances
under
which
a
change
from
“flow-through”
would
be
justified
and
i
think
that’s
all
that
the
--
this
reference
has
do
with
it.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
on
the
face
of
the
act
itself,
there
is
no
such
provision
about
a
regulatory
agency
permitting
the
change.
you
don’t
find
that
in
the
act,
that’s
just
a
comment
on
the
part
of
the
people
who
were
working
on
the
act.
mr.
george
e.
morrow
but,
yes
your
honor.
mr.
george
e.
morrow
but
your
honor,
congress
have
two
concerns
of
equal
value
to
it
at
that
time.
one
of
the
concerns
was
that
we
stopped
the
trend
to
flow-through.
mr.
george
e.
morrow
the
other
concern
was
that
we
do
it
without
creating
widespread
prompt
substantial
rate
--
utility
rate
increase.
now,
this
--
mr.
george
e.
morrow
we
believe
that
it
had
no
discretion
to
do
what
it
did
in
this
case,
your
honor,
that’s
right.
mr.
george
e.
morrow
not
under
the
circumstances
of
the
state.
mr.
george
e.
morrow
no,
your
honor.
i
don’t
say
that,
i
say
that
that
piece
of
legislative
history
has
its
place
under
a
proper
fact
situation
but
this
is
not
the
fact
situation.
mr.
george
e.
morrow
under
the
circumstances
of
this
case,
the
commission
had
no
discretion
to
do
what
it
did.
mr.
george
e.
morrow
yes,
your
honor.
and
it
said
so
on
two
bases.
first,
on
its
reading
of
the
act
itself
and
secondly,
on
the
proposition
that
the
federal
power
commission
has
an
absolute
legal
duty
to
allow
in
cost
of
service
nothing
more
than
actual
taxes
--
the
real
tax
expense.
and
this
we
say
is
the
principle
that
was
violated
by
the
federal
power
commission
in
this
case
and
that’s
why
the
commission
is
wrong.
mr.
george
e.
morrow
your
honor,
i'm
not
saying
that
rule
3
is
of
course,
it’s
not
wrong
it’s
the
law.
mr.
george
e.
morrow
no,
sir.
thank
you
mr.
justice
stewart.
it
doesn’t
because
there
are
circumstances
under
which
it
might
be
proper
for
a
utility
commission
to
move
a
company
of
a
“flow-through”
and
then
--
mr.
george
e.
morrow
your
honor,
--
mr.
george
e.
morrow
i
believe
that
under
the
circumstances
of
this
case,
--
mr.
george
e.
morrow
alright,
here’s
what
the
--
well,
alright.
what
the
commission
wants
to
do
in
this
case
and
may
i
say
something
before
i
get
into
that
definite
if
you
want
to
get
to
that.
mr.
george
e.
morrow
but
you
see
in
the
course
of
the
legislation,
the
passage
of
the
legislation
through
congress,
first,
chairman
white
of
the
commission
came
up
to
congress
and
said,
we’d
like
to
have
it
everything
just
put
on
straight-line
depreciation.
the
congress
turned
down
that
request
for
the
reason
that
in
addition
that
the
one
mentioned
by
mr.
boland
for
the
reason
that
to
put
everybody
on
straight-line
would
result
in
prompt
substantial
widespread
utility
rate
increases.
and
congress
did
not
want
prompt
rate
increases
to
come
into
effect
and
so
they
turned
him
down.
now,
mr.
justice
white,
if
the
commission
should
win
this
case
under
the
commission’s
decision
in
this
case
we
reached
almost
exactly
the
same
situation
that
we
would
have
reach
under
chairman
white’s
suggestion.
the
utilities
would
charge
their
rates
on
the
basis
of
straight-line
depreciation,
but
pay
their
taxes
on
the
basis
of
accelerated
depreciation.
and
for
right
purposes,
you
would
in
a
fact
have
straight-line
depreciation.
it’s
not
quite
the
same
but
it’s
almost
the
same
and
this
is
what
chairman
white
suggested
and
this
is
what
they
turned
down.
now,
when
they
did
that,
they
thought
that
they
had
accomplished
their
purpose
without
putting
any
rate
--
in
any
law
into
effect
which
would
cause
rate
increases
in
the
utilities.
they
said
that
the
bill
would
forestall
the
revenue
loss
which
the
continuation
of
existing
trends
would
make
almost
inevitable.
and
that
it
would
do
so
“in
a
way
which
with
very
few
exceptions
will
require
no
increase
in
utility
rates
because
of
the
tax
laws.
mr.
george
e.
morrow
your
honor,
i
believe
that
it
was
the
intent
of
congress
to
accomplish
the
“freeze”
and
to
accomplish
it
in
such
a
way
as
to
avoid
rate
increases.
i
believe
that
the
action
of
the
commission
not
only
“unfreezes”
but
it
drastically
revolutionizes
utility
practices
and
does
so
in
a
way
which
causes
rate
increases.
in
other
words,
the
result
reached
by
the
commission
is
precisely
the
opposite
of
the
result
which
congress
saw.
now,
let
me
point
this
out,
when
the
bill
got
into
the
senate,
someone
in
the
senate
suggested,
let’s
give
the
pipelines
or
the
utility
the
power
or
election
to
change
to
away
from
--
to
abolish
“flow-through”
depreciation
with
respect
to
all
the
properties.
abolish
“flow-through”
with
respect
to
all
the
properties.
now,
if
that
had
happened,
you
would
have
almost
exactly
the
same
situation
that
you
have
under
the
act
as
it
was
passed
--
i
mean
under
the
act
that
was
construed
by
the
commission.
the
commission
says,
this
little
--
the
election
with
respect
to
expansion
property
puts
us
in
a
position
where
for
all
practical
purposes
we
got
to
allow
the
pipeline
to
go
on
and
normalizes
to
all
its
properties.
we
have
no
alternative,
that’s
the
commission’s
position
in
this
case.
we
are
force
into
it
by
the
practicalities
of
the
situation.
so
what
the
commission
is
saying
that
an
election
with
respect
to
the
expansion
properties
is
tantamount
for
all
practical
purposes
to
an
election
with
respect
to
all
properties.
this
is
precisely
what
the
senate
proposed
to
put
in
the
act
and
which
the
congress
turned
down.
so,
twice
this
matter
was
considered,
twice
the
congress
turned
it
down.
the
commission
has
now
reached
the
very
result
which
congress
turned
down.
let
me
address
myself
to
the
reason
why
i
think
that
the
commission
does
not
have
the
discretion
to
do
what
it
did.
first
--
mr.
george
e.
morrow
well
--
mr.
george
e.
morrow
no,
alright.
let’s
talk
about
in
terms
of
the
commission’s
power.
the
commission
is
under
the
duty
as
the
court
below
said
that
to
allow
a
tax
cost
in
the
cost
of
service
which
is
no
greater
than
actual
taxes.
the
court
says
this,
there’s
nothing
in
the
tax
reform
act
of
1969
which
modifies
the
commission’s
duty
under
the
natural
gas
act
to
require
regulated
utilities
companies
such
as
texas
gas
to
set
rates
which
reflect
actually
expenditures
with
respect
to
such
property
--
the
set
rates
which
reflect
actual
expenditure.
now,
the
commission
does
not
have
discretion
then
to
grant
a
utility,
a
tax
allowance
and
its
cost
of
service.
it
doesn’t
have
power
to
grant
a
utility
and
allowance
and
its
cost
of
service
for
taxes
which
are
not
paid.
in
other
words,
it
does
not
have
the
power
to
treat
as
a
cost
something
which
in
fact
is
not
a
cost.
mr.
george
e.
morrow
that’s
right
your
honor.
that
is
the
law
under
the
natural
gas
act
as
the
court
of
appeals
held
and
as
this
court
held
in
united
u.s.
pipeline
versus
fpc,
which
was
a
tax
case
and
which
mr.
justice
white
is
familiar
with.
in
that
case,
the
court
said
that
the
commission
have
the
power
and
the
duty
to
limit
the
cost
of
service
to
real
expenses.
now,
in
this
case,
texas
gas
is
normalization
on
its
little
tag
of
expansion
property
is
not
going
to
increase
its
depreciation,
not
under
decrease
it’s
the
depreciation
by
one
dime.
now
or
ever,
it’s
not
going
to
increase
its
income
taxes
with
respect
to
depreciation
by
one
dime
now
or
ever.
the
only
effect
that
it
will
have
or
to
be
put
more
money
in
texas
gas’
pockets.
texas
gas
gets
to
charge
a
higher
rate
because
of
normalization
with
respect
to
this
little
piece
of
expansion
property
and
it
gets
to
pocket
the
difference.
and
the
commission
is
in
the
position
of
saying
that
because
texas
gas
gets
increase
revenues
due
--
with
respect
to
its
expansion
property.
therefore,
in
order
to
keep
it
even,
in
order
to
keep
it
whole
it’s
got
to
get
increase
revenues
on
a
large
scale
with
respect
to
its
$600
million
worth
of
depreciable
rate
base.
there
is
no
increase
in
texas
gas’
taxes
as
a
result
of
it’s
going
to
normalize
depreciation
on
its
expansion
property.
therefore,
we
say
that
the
commission
had
no
power
to
give
it
an
additional
return
or
an
additional
amount
in
its
cost
of
service
to
do
this.
we
say
that
if
we
do.
that
if
you
do,
you
have
accomplished
precisely
what
congress
was
attempting
to
avoid.
congress
said,
let’s
freeze
the
situation
and
avoid
tax
rate
increases.
the
effect
of
the
commission’s
decision
is
to
unfreeze
the
situation
and
drastically
change
tax
practices
and
do
so
at
the
cost
of
hundreds
of
millions
of
dollars
of
utility
rate
increases
throughout
the
united
states.
mr.
george
e.
morrow
your
honor,
this
is
just
an
illustration.
the
whole
concept
and
i'm
sure
your
honor
knows
because
you
are
on
the
panhandle
case
in
the
city
of
chicago
case.
the
whole
concept
of
normalized
depreciation
is
that
it
works
when
the
company
is
in
an
expanding
condition
or
its
depreciable
base
is
at
least
stable,
then
the
principle
flow-through
depreciation
where
your
new
properties
coming
in
all
set
your
old
properties
which
are
declining
in
value,
that
principle
works.
it
would
not
work
with
the
pipeline
which
because
of
the
gas
shortage
or
whatever
was
winding
down
its
activities.
and
therefore,
if
a
corporate
--
if
the
tax
utility
or
particular
a
pipeline
were
caught
in
the
winding
down
condition
where
its
depreciable
property
was
actually
decreasing,
then
this
would
not
be
applicable.
but
let
me
point
out
that
there
is
not
one
shred
of
evidence
in
this
case.
not
a
shred
of
evidence
that
texas
gas’
property
is
going
to
be
--
is
going
to
wind
down
or
decrease.
as
a
matter
of
fact
there
is
the
question
of
normalization
was
never
even
considered
in
the
trial
of
this
case.
texas
gas
didn’t
ask
for
it
when
it
filed
its
return,
nobody
put
in
any
evidence
on
it.
there’s
not
a
shred
of
evidence
in
this
case
about
the
effects
of
normalization
on
texas
gas.
so,
we
say
that
what
the
commission
has
done,
is
to
--
your
honor,
i
thought
i
was
given
a
light
if
i
overstepped
my
colleagues.
mr.
george
e.
morrow
i
was
going
to
be
given
a
white
light
and
i
didn’t
see
it.
i
hope
i
haven’t
overstepped
my
colleagues’
time
because
i
was
supposed
to
leave.
mr.
george
e.
morrow
thank
you
your
honor.
i
will
just
summarize
by
saying
this.
that
congress
had
a
specific
problem
in
mind.
the
problem
was
to
avoid
further
tax
losses
is
by
stemming
the
flow
toward
“flow-through.”
it
had
two
purposes
in
mind,
the
other
one
was
to
do
so
without
causing
utility
rate
increases.
the
result
reached
by
the
commission
in
this
case
causes
enormous
utility
rate
increases
all
over
the
country.
the
result
reached
by
the
court
of
appeals
causes
no
increases
and
exactly
coincides
with
the
intent
and
purpose
of
congress.
thank
you.
