justice
potter
stewart
may
i
ask
you
a
couple
of
questions,
does
the
record
of
the
--
does
the
legislative
history
show
why
congress
is
concern
was
limited
to
the
impact
of
accelerated
depreciation
only
with
respect
to
public
utilities?
justice
potter
stewart
well
now
that’s
what
i
want
to
get.
justice
potter
stewart
of
tax
remedy
–
because
of
the
higher
deduction
there’s
a
lower
tax
remedy?
justice
potter
stewart
i
see,
so
there’s
a
first
of
all
a
--
i
see
everything
that
lower
rates
to
the
consumers?
justice
potter
stewart
what
was
the
company
use?
justice
potter
stewart
why
did
congress
feel
that
the
existing
situation
as
administered
by
the
agency
needed
some
statutory
provision?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
why
though
--
what
and
why
then
wouldn’t
congress
is
simply
force
everyone
off
of
“flow-through”
for
all
as
well
as
new
property?
justice
potter
stewart
it
would
--
if
existing
properties
were
suddenly
put
on
the
straight-line
or
normalization,
there
would
necessarily
be
rate
increases,
is
that
it?
justice
potter
stewart
and
do
you
think
that
is
what
was
on
congress’
mind?
justice
potter
stewart
but
they
weren’t
concerned
enough
to
do
anything
but
give
the
--
but
give
an
option?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i
know
but
the
--
an
agency
that
have
been
requiring
or
looking
for
its
“flow-through”,
what
would
they
do
about
existing
properties?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
where
are
the
views
of
these
regulatory
agencies
were
pretty
clear
with?
justice
potter
stewart
yes,
that’s
this
case.
justice
potter
stewart
and
the
rates?
justice
potter
stewart
that
so
that
and
for
the
same
reason
in
rule
3
is
wrong?
justice
potter
stewart
what
if
we
put
it
another
way,
doesn’t
rule
3
apply
in
face
of
what
you
have
just
said?
justice
potter
stewart
well
then,
again
and
we
are
here
to
just
reviewing
that
the
decision
of
the
commission
is
to
whether
the
circumstances
are
proper
in
this
case?
justice
potter
stewart
is
that
what
the
issue
is
here?
