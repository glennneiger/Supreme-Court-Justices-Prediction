chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
will
hear
arguments
next
in
72-11
palmore
against
the
united
states.
mr.
flegal.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
general,
is
this
statute
to
somewhat
like
that
of
california
like
in
the
other
states?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now
you
emphasize
these
benefits
and
safeguards
but
those
are
benefits
and
safeguards
that
most
of
the
citizens
and
most
of
the
states
do
not
have.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
yeah,
that
is
what
made
me
wonder
about
your
great
emphasis
on
it
since
most
of
the
200
million
people
in
the
country
are
subject
to
it.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
from
alaska,
when
did
we
buy
alaska
from
russia?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
they
continued
to
the
temporary
status
for
about
a
hundred
and
some
years.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
doesn't
the
constitution,
the
framers
go
to
some
pains
to
single
out
the
district
of
columbia
procedure
of
government
in
defining
the
plenary
powers
that
you
are
talking
about?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
the
state
has,
when
we
think
of
a
state
having
legislative
power
does
that
not
include
the
power
to
create
courts?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
legislative
powers
if
the
congress
include
the
power
to
create
courts
and
define
jurisdictions
courts
and
the
tenure
of
the
judges.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
what
you
are
arguing
now
is
that
the
defendant
has
the
same
right
to
an
article
iii
judge
on
the
same
constitutional
level
is
the
right
to
be
indicted
by
a
grand
jury
and
then
all
the
others?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
suppose
the
police
department
came
to
the
conclusion
that
there
were
great
many
unlicensed
drivers,
driving
unsafe
cars
and
so
they
have
decided
to
check
every
50th
car
that
a
policeman
could
see
during
his
hours
when
he
wasn't
otherwise
engaged.
would
you
think
that
would
be
alright?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
you
think
a
random
check
is
not
permitted?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
if
these
–
what
if
the
department
said
that
check
all
rental
cars
because
we
--
let
us
assume
they
had
concluded
that
rental
agencies
were
being
very
relax
about
requiring
people
to
produce
a
drivers
license
and
so
they
order
is
to
check
all
rental
cars.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
for
everything.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
suppose
your
position
would
have
to
be
the
same
on
the
search
and
seizure,
if
upon
stopping
the
car
and
trying
--
coming
closed
to
it.
they
saw
a
small
child
bound
in
gag
in
the
back
of
the
car,
they
couldn't
see
is
the
child
and
release
it,
could
they?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
how
is
the
gun
that
they
found
in
the
car
any
different
from
anything
else
that
might
kind
of
find
in
the
car?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
said
that
will
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
he
ran
his
flashlight,
if
that's
what
it
was
in
the
backseat,
he
found
that
there
was
a
person,
a
body,
and
let's
say,
a
body
of
a
dead
person
all
tied
up?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
on
the
way
to
just
big
bear
so
such
thing
now.
do
anything
about
that?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
if
they
introduce
that
body
to
charge
this
man
with
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well,
mr.
flegal.
mr.
solicitor
general.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
that
case,
was
bigamy
a
felony,
i
assume
it
was?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we'll
resume
there
after
lunch,
mr.
solicitor
general.
mr.
solicitor
general,
you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
solicitor
general.
mr.
flegal,
we'll
allow
you
six
minutes
enlarging
your
time
a
little
bit.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
then
as
you
read
seventeenth
clause
of
section
8,
article
i,
the
legislative
power
of
congress
over
the
district
is
narrower,
is
less
broad
than
the
legislative
power
of
the
state
in
creating
its
own
ordinance
of
government.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
why?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
in
the
territory
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
then
you
are
giving
residents
of
the
district
of
columbia
something
more
than
residents
of
maryland?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
let
me
put
it
to
you
this
way.
there
are
felonies
in
the
state
of
maryland,
they
are
in
the
state
of
virginia,
as
to
which
the
residents
of
those
states
or
any
person
apprehended
there,
and
charged
would
not
give
an
articles
iii
court
isn't
that
true?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
so
that
in
that
sense,
you
are
suggesting
that
the
residents
of
district
of
columbia
get
something
that
residents
of
no
other
state
had
except
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
[voice
overlap]
before
the
state
tribunals,
except
to
the
extent
that
is
comparable
10
year
in
massachusetts,
and
several
other
states.
chief
justice
warren
e.
