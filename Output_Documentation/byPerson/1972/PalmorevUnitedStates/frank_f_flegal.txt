mr.
frank
f.
flegal
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
on
february
the
1st,
1971
the
district
of
columbia
court
reorganization
act
became
effective.
among
other
things
that
act
created
the
superior
court
of
the
district
of
columbia,
a
court
and
its
judges
hold
office
for
limited
terms
and
vested
jurisdiction
in
that
court
to
hear
and
determine
certain
felony
charges
brought
by
the
united
states
of
america
against
persons
accused
violating
acts
of
congress
applicable
exclusively
to
the
district
of
columbia.
the
courts
below
and
the
parties
have
tended
to
call
such
acts,
local
statutes.
on
february
23rd
of
1971,
appellant
was
indicted
in
the
superior
court
for
violation
of
such
a
statute.
the
crime
of
carrying
a
dangerous
weapon,
in
this
case,
a
gun
without
a
permit
having
been
issued
in
accordance
with
law.
since
appellant
had
previously
been
convicted
of
another
and
an
unrelated
felony
and
that
prior
conviction
is
not
an
issue
here.
the
charge
against
him
was
a
felony
charge,
if
convicted
he
stood
do
face
imprisonment
for
up
to
ten
years.
prior
to
trial
appellant
challenged
the
jurisdiction
of
the
superior
court.
he
claimed
that
he
was
entitled
to
have
his
case
heard
and
determined
by
a
constitutional
court
that
is
of
course,
a
court
was
then
been
established
in
accordance
with
article
iii
and
presided
over
by
a
judge
holding
office
during
good
behavior.
mr.
frank
f.
flegal
yes
sir
it
was.
mr.
frank
f.
flegal
yes,
indeed
so
sir.
we
make
a
distinction
here
and
let
me
just
briefly
elude
to
it
now
and
then
when
we
get
to
the
argument
address
it
in
full.
historically,
as
this
court
is
dealt
with
in
the
article
iii
jury
trial
cases.
there
has
been
a
distinction
between
minor
or
petty
cases.
historically,
as
this
court
pointed
out
in
the
clawans
case,
300
united
states.
english
judges
prior
to
the
adoption
of
the
constitution,
judges
not
of
the
general
jurisdiction
of
england,
held
and
heard
and
determine
minor
matters
involving
up
to
one
year
imprisonment.
congress
has
always
assumed
that
to
be
the
case
in
the
district
of
columbia
and
indeed
nor
has
magistrates
in
the
several
states,
non
article
iii
officers
hearing
such
minor
matters.
for
purposes
of
our
argument
we
assume
that
there
is
a
class
of
matter
and
we
assume
although
this
court
has
never
decided
that
a
misdemeanor
and
one
year
is
the
appropriate
constitutional
judgement.
there
is
a
historical
basis
for
that.
mr.
frank
f.
flegal
indeed
there
maybe
--
mr.
frank
f.
flegal
in
any
event
whatever
the
law
and
event,
a
felony
is
our
proposition
in
this
case.
after
that
motion
was
overruled,
the
trial
court
proceeded
to
consider
appellants
motion
to
suppress
evidence
which
was
based
upon
appellants
fourth
amendment
contention
that
the
method
by
which
police
officers
obtained
the
evidence
in
this
case,
the
gun,
was
a
result
of
an
unreasonable
seizure
of
appellants
purse.
the
court
heard
evidence
and
i
put
aside
for
the
moment
the
details
of
that
evidence
so
that
it
would
be
freshly
at
hand
when
returned
to
the
fourth
amendment
argument,
fourth
amendment
position
later
in
the
argument
and
having
heard
that
evidence
overruled
appellant's
objection.
appellant
elected
to
stand
on
the
legal
issue
which
had
been
raised
and
trial
by
jury
having
been
waived,
the
trial
court
found
appellant
guilty
of
the
charge
against
it.
he
was
subsequently
sentenced
to
from
2-6
years
in
prison.
execution
of
the
sentence
was
suspended
except
for
180
days
imprisonment
on
condition
of
six
years
probation.
an
appeal
was
taken
to
the
district
of
columbia
court
of
appeals
and
that
court
affirmed
the
judgement.
thereafter
appellant
review
was
sought
in
this
court.
we
sought
review
by
filing
a
notice
of
appeal
in
the
district
of
columbia
court
of
appeals
and
docketing
a
jurisdictional
statement
in
this
court.
on
october
10,
1972
this
court
entered
an
order
placing
this
case
on
its
hearing
calendar
but
postponing
the
question
of
jurisdiction
until
the
argument
of
the
case
on
the
merits.
accordingly
i
return
to
that
threshold
question.
strictly
speaking
of
course,
it
is
not
a
question
of
this
courts
appellate
jurisdiction.
for
all
parties
can
see
that
this
court
has
a
jurisdiction
to
review
the
judgement
of
the
district
of
columbia
court
of
appeals
in
this
case.
the
question
is
rather
a
statutory
question.
the
mode
or
the
manner
by
which
we
should
have
invoked
this
court's
appellate
jurisdiction.
it
is
our
contention
that
when
congress
as
it
has
done
in
the
district
of
columbia
courts,
creates
a
local
court
system
and
vest
that
local
court
system
with
jurisdiction
to
hear
local
matters
and
provides
that
appeals
from
the
highest
local
court
shall
we
taken
to
this
court
in
accordance
with
the
general
provision
of
section
1257
of
the
judicial
court.
locally
applicable
laws
constitute
a
law
of
a
state
within
the
meaning
of
1257
subdivision
2.
for
that
proposition
we
place
of
course,
principal
reliance
on
the
analogous
case
of
balzac
against
porto
rico,
decided
50
years
ago
where
congress
provided
the
judgments
of
the
supreme
court
of
porto
rico
would
be
reviewed
in
this
court,
in
accordance
with
1257
and
the
issue
in
balzac
was
whether
or
not
a
statute
applicable
exclusively
to
porto
rico
was
there
by
dimmed
to
be
a
statute
of
a
state.
in
a
unanimous
opinion
written
by
chief
justice
taft,
this
court
held
that
it
was.
now
it's
quite
as
the
government
points
out
that
the
legislature
that
had
enacted
the
statute
in
balzac
was
a
territorial
legislature
not
the
united
states
congress
but
that
fact
played
no
articulable
part
in
this
court's
opinion.
rather
the
chief
justice
focused
on
the
manifesting
intent
of
congress.
a
point
of
course,
which
this
court
reiterated
just
last
month
in
the
canter
case,
the
intent
of
congress
in
enacting
and
providing
for
such
a
method
of
review.
for
reason
set
forth
in
balzac
and
articulated
in
our
opinion,
we
think
this
case
is
properly
heard
on
appeal.
at
the
outset
of
course,
by
the
filing
right
jurisdiction
papers
and
again
in
our
brief
we
have
invoked
in
the
alternative,
the
certiorari
jurisdiction
of
this
court
in
the
even
that
we
are
on.
but
of
course,
having
the
case
here
whether
by
certiorari
or
appeal
does
not
answer
the
question
which
was
raised
and
overruled
in
the
trial
court.
was
appellant
entitled
to
have
his
case
heard
and
determined
by
a
constitutional
court?
article
iii
discussions
tend
frequently
to
become
academic
and
there
are
several
nuances
in
article
iii
issues
and
the
parties
have
pursued
those
in
their
brief.
mr.
frank
f.
flegal
here
is
nothing
to
do
with
the
answer
of
the
second.
first
question
is
purely
a
statutory
construction.
mr.
frank
f.
flegal
certiorari
â€“
mr.
frank
f.
flegal
completely
unrelated,
it's
the
mode
of
seeking
review
the
statutory
mode
and
it's
purely
a
question
of
statutory
interpretation.
on
the
merits
however,
it.
mr.
frank
f.
flegal
for
purposes
of
a
statute,
your
honor,
not
for
purposes
of
article
iii
section
one
of
the
constitution.
mr.
frank
f.
flegal
that
is
the
question.
excuse
me,
of
course,
that
is
the
question
on
the
first
proposition
the
appeal
as
opposed
to
certiorari.
mr.
frank
f.
flegal
indeed
i
answer.
indeed
i
am
suggesting.
mr.
frank
f.
flegal
i
do
get
different
answers
and
i
say
that
because
under
the
statute
the
question
of
course
is
purely
one
of
statutory
construction
what
did
congress
intent
under
article
iii
of
the
constitution.
we
have
of
course
a
constitutional
issue
what
did
the
framers
mean
and
it
is
not
conceded.
the
government
does
not
oppose
the
proposition,
that
went
in
the
meaning
of
article
iii
of
the
constitution
and
act
of
congress
that
will
be
if
one
applicable
only
to
the
district
of
columbia
is
of
course,
a
law
of
the
united
states.
that's
the
only
basis
by
which
this
court's
appellate
jurisdiction
from
the
beginning
of
the
republic
with
respect
to
local
district
of
columbia
matters
not
otherwise
involving
a
constitutional
issue
can
be
sustained.
our
preposition
is
that
the
article
iii
protection
for
the
independence
of
the
federal
judge
that
is
the
good
behavior
tenure
and
the
associated
constitutional
restrictions
control
of
course,
important
rights
on
the
judge.
but
principally
an
important
claim
for
purposes
of
this
case,
they
also
confer
rights
and
benefits
and
safeguard
on
the
litigants.
now
that
is
a
preposition
which
the
government
contested
at
the
outset
of
this
case.
at
the
threshold
stage,
the
government
suggested
that
we
did
not
have
standing
to
raise
this
issue.
they
have
abandoned
that
in
their
brief
and
i
think
properly
so.
this
court
has
addressed
the
meaning
of
the
good
behavior
clause
as
it
effects
litigants.
time
and
again,
and
what
i
don't
want
to
deliver
the
point,
i
want
to
emphasize
two
cases
on
which
we
principally
rely
and
that
is
of
course,
the
o'donoghue
case
where
this
court
trace
the
meaning
of
article
iii
with
respect
to
litigants.
in
o'donoghue
this
court
referred
for
example,
to
one
of
the
specific
complaints
which
desires
of
the
declaration
had
made.
the
judges
were
being
limited
in
their
tenure
and
having
their
salaries
reduced
and
in
o'donoghue
and
again
in
lark
and
the
court-martial
cases.
parker
and
o'callahan.
mr.
frank
f.
flegal
o'donoghue
was
a
judge,
your
honor.
however
toth
and
o'callahan
were
litigants
as
was
larkin
the
litigant
in
the
companion
case
in
glidden
v.
zdanok
and
in
lark,
this
court
referred
to
the
protection
designed
in
part
for
the
protection
of
the
litigant
and
that
is
the
protection
which
we
saught.
mr.
frank
f.
flegal
that
was
the
plurality
opinion,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
frank
f.
flegal
the
plurality
opinion
by
mr.
justice
harlan.
mr.
frank
f.
flegal
not
a
court
opinion
in
lark.
of
course,
it
is
mr.
justice
black's
plurality
opinion
in
part,
a
court
opinion
in
o'callahan,
all
dealing
with
litigants
and
all
referring
to
the
right
by
the
contort
on
the
litigant.
now,
of
course,
there
can
be
no
contention
here
as
was
the
issue
in
lark
that
appellant
did
receive
an
article
3
judge.
the
judge
that
presided
in
our
trial
holds
office
for
15
years,
not
good
behavior.
he
is
not
subject
to
protection
from
diminishment
of
his
salary
and
he
is
not
answerable
only
to
the
other
branches
of
government
through
the
impeachment
process,
he
is
answerable
to
a
commission.
the
commission
on
judicial
disabilities
and
tenure
which
consists
of
five
members,
three
of
them
are
appointed
by
the
president
of
the
united
states.
the
fourth
by
the
mayor
commissioner
of
the
district
of
columbia
who
in
turn,
of
course,
is
appointed
by
the
president
and
the
fifth,
by
the
chief
judge
of
the
district
court.
any
four
members
of
that
commission
have
power
after
holding
appropriate
proceedings
to
remove
the
judge
and
if
he
is
removed,
if
a
commission
order
is
entered,
his
salary
instantly
stops,
pending
his
resort
to
judicial
review
and
his
judicial--
mr.
frank
f.
flegal
somewhat,
yes,
quite
like
a
state,
your
honor
but
of
course,
totally
foreign
to
article
3.
the
review
is
sought
by
firing
and
notice
of
appeal
with
your
honor,
who
is
there
upon
called
to
designate
a
special
three-judge
tribunal
consisting
on
circuit
and/or
district
judges
to
finally
hear
and
determine.
so,
thanks
to
the
right
we
claimed.
mr.
frank
f.
flegal
at
least
with
respect
to
the
other
two
branches
of
government,
your
honor.
it
is
not
add
issue
in
this
case
as
to
whether
within
the
judicial
branch
the
chamber
problems,
whether
there
is
within
the
judicial
branch
some
power
of
superintendence
of
the
performance
of
lower
court
or
inferior
judges.
our
proposition
is
that
the
impeachment
clause
is
the
only
way
the
other
branches
of
government
can
oversee
the
performance
of
judges.
mr.
frank
f.
flegal
oh,
of
course,
of
course
and
it
is
a
question
which
is
not
raised
in
that
case.
there
is
no
question
here
that
the
judicial
disabilities
and
tenure
commission
is
a
body
of
good
behavior
judges
but
our
proposition
turns
on
the
other
two
branches
of
government,
not
the
judiciary,
your
honor.
mr.
frank
f.
flegal
it
is
not
a
wholly
established
principle,
that's
right
and
so--
mr.
frank
f.
flegal
precisely,
your
honor,
precisely
and
of
course,
there
is
no
holding
--
mr.
frank
f.
flegal
yes,
the
question
then
arises,
are
we
entitled
to
this
right?
if
article
3
safeguards
and
benefits
mean
anything,
if
the
founders
did
not
accomplish
a
fruitless
act
in
so
far
as
litigants
are
concerned,
then
of
course,
we
contend
that
the
felony
class
of
case
has
to
be
included
within
these
protections.
in
other
words,
if
anyone
is
to
get
these
benefits
other
than
perhaps
judges,
if
any
litigant
is
a
felony
litigant
must
have
them
because
no
other
place
that
we
can
conceive
would
rise
to
greater
constitutional
dignity.
perhaps
others,
perhaps
constitutional
questions
would
be
similar
but
nothing
would
be
higher.
then
why,
according
to
the
courts
below
and
the
government
are
we
not
entitled
to
this
constitutional
protection.
the
government
suggests
that
there
is
no
requirement
in
article
3
that
congress
afford
this
constitutional
right
to
any
litigant
and
the
government
supports
this
proposition
by
suggesting
that
with
respect
to
at
least
any
one
of
the
enumerated
legislative
powers
of
congress
and
this
is
an
argument
which
is
not
limited
to
the
district
of
columbia,
either
in
the
district
or
in
the
several
states,
congress
may
create
a
so-called
legislative
court,
a
non-constitutional
court
and
thereby
deprive
us
of
the
benefits
and
safeguards
to
which
this
court
has
repeatedly
referred.
mr.
frank
f.
flegal
oh
precisely,
it
is
not
a
fourteenth
amendment
benefit
and
safeguard
at
all,
your
honor
and
we
don't
contend
that
it
is.
mr.
frank
f.
flegal
right,
our
contention,
of
course,
is
that
the
original
constitution
and
certain
protections
in
the
first
ten
amendments,
for
example,
grand
jury
indictment
article
3
in
sixth
amendment
trial
by
jury
are
of
course
rights
which
are
afforded
litigants
when
the
federal
judicial
powers
brought
to
bed,
not
necessarily
required
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
in
the
states.
we
make
no
contention
that
there
is
anything
fundamentally
unfair
in
the
fourteenth
amendment
sense
about
having
judges
with
limited
tenure.
our
proposition
is
the
framers
gave
a
right
in
article
3
beyond
that,
which
fourteenth
amendment
due
process
would
require
to
be
afforded.
government
says
that
because
under
the
supremacy
clause,
congress
could
argue
and
though
require
state
courts
to
hear
and
determine
federal
felonies
thatâ€™s
the
end
of
the
inquiry.
if
they
can
require
this
case
to
be
heard
in
a
state
court,
the
government
argues.
then
of
course,
a
state
court
judge
following
up
on
your
honor's
proposition
would
not
hold
life
tenure
and
why
are
we
entitled
to
it?
i
suggest
the
distinction
which
your
honor's
question
focuses
is
precisely
the
fallacy
of
the
government's
argument.
in
the
first
place,
when
a
state
court
hears
a
case,
whether
or
not
that
case
arises
under
state
law
or
arises
out
of
an
active
congress
which
the
state
is
enforcing
under
the
supremacy
clause,
the
state
is
exercising
the
state's
judicial
power,
not
the
judicial
power
of
the
united
states
and
article
3
by
its
terms
is
a
limitation
on
federal
not
state
judicial
power
and
taken
one
step
further,
the
proposition
that
was
addressed
by
the
chief
justice's
question,
the
government's
position
puts
federal
courts
on
the
plain
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
the
government's
argument
carried
to
its
logical
extension,
create
a
non-article
3
court
because
you
could
create
a
state,
you
could
require
a
state
court
to
do
it,
means
that
any
right
that
a
federal
defendant
has
that
a
fourteenth
amendment
defendant
in
the
state
court
does
not
have
could
be
deprived
and
i
don't
think
that
is
the
law,
i
don't
think
the
congress
can
deprive
a
federal
litigant
of
a
grand
jury
enticement,
even
though
a
state
may
not
have
to
provide
it
or
of
an
article
3
jury
or
of
an
article
3
judge.
what
then
does
the
government
argue
beyond
that?
the
government
relies,
of
course,
on
the
legislative
court
cases.
the
government
says
that
there
is
a
judicial
power
outside
of
article
3
which
is
co-extensive
with
that
conferred
in
article
3.
this
court
has
never
so
held,
this
court
has
never
so
held.
in
the
permanent
part
of
the
united
states,
this
court
has
always
carefully
looked
at
the
nature
of
the
matter
being
adjudicated
by
the
so-called
legislative
court
and
if
that
matter
was
a
subject
for
which
the
litigant
had
to
right
to
claim
judicial
determination,
if
it
was
subject
to
being
disposed
off
by
exercise
of
another
power,
legislative
or
executive,
then
the
court
has
said,
it
is
permissible
to
have
the
matter
adjudicated
in
a
legislative
court.
there
has
never
been
even
a
piece
of
dicta
in
one
of
this
court's
legislative
court
cases
which
would
suggest
that
a
non-article
3
court
could
hear
and
determine
a
felony
and
impose
a
felony
punishment.
mr.
frank
f.
flegal
it
is
an
interesting
question
on
theory,
your
honor.
justice
harlan
and
his
plurality
opinion
in
glidden
against
zdanok
said
yes,
they
were,
that
they
were
article
3
judges
exercising
article
3
judicial
power
but
exempt
because
of
the
peculiar
temporary
status
of
the
territories
from
article
3
tenure
requirement.
mr.
frank
f.
flegal
i
think
what
it
means
â€“
mr.
frank
f.
flegal
i
think
what
it
means
your
honor.
i
think
what
justice
harlan
had
in
mind
was
the
nature
of
the
matters
they
were
determining,
where
the
kind
of
matters
including
felonies
which
could
only
be
adjudicated
by
an
article
3
court.
therefore,
they
had
to
be
exercising
the
judicial
power
of
article
3.
mr.
frank
f.
flegal
that
is
right.
he
then
said,
however,
because
of
the
temporary
status
of
the
territories,
they
were
exempt
from
the
good
behavior
clause.
that
more
recently,
this
court
in
the
carter
case
and
back
in
o'
donoghue
said,
they
werenâ€™t
article
3
judges
at
all.
they
were
always
article
4
judges
exercising
the
power
conferred
upon
congress
under
the
territories
clause,
the
acquisition
clause
outside
of
and
this
we
think
is
the
important
point
in
this
case.
mr.
frank
f.
flegal
various
proposals
had
been
used
in
the
different
territories,
your
honor.
sometimes,
the
president
appointed
and
congress
confirmed
and
other
times,
local
legislatures
or
the
territorial
governor
confirmed
the
territorial
judges
but
they
all
said,
for
limited
terms
of
office.
at
the
present
time,
we
have
several
kinds
of
territorial
judges.
those
of
puerto
rico
are
appointed
by
the
president
with
the
advice
and
consent
of
the
senate
and
hold
their
office
during
at
least
statutory
good
behavior
and
yet
as
the
government
has
pointed
out
in
its
brief
out
in
samoa,
for
example,
the
president
of
the
united
states
appoints
the
officer
or
official
to
exercise
the
judicial
power.
but
the
critical
point
and
why
we
distinguish
the
territorial
court
cases
is
all
of
those
have
dealt
with
temporary
necessity
out
in
non
permanent
parts
of
the
federal
union.
mr.
frank
f.
flegal
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
frank
f.
flegal
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
frank
f.
flegal
a
way
back
your
honor.
mr.
frank
f.
flegal
right,
perhaps
i
should
have
prefaced
my
statement
as
constitutional
temporary
status.
in
other
words,
the
first
three
articles
of
the
constitution
which
include
the
states
and
the
district
of
columbia,
that's
the
permanent
union.
then
the
territories
may
or
may
not
join
that
union
either
as
states
or
perhaps
under
some
other
arrangement.
but
until
they
do,
they
are
not
constitutionally
permanent.
we
can
sale
the
territory,
relinquish
it,
return
it
to
another
sovereign
and
so
forth.
mr.
frank
f.
flegal
indeed
so,
your
honor
including
capital
punishment,
indeed
so.
mr.
frank
f.
flegal
they
indeed
were
your
honor.
the
litigants
in
the
territorial
court
cases
did
not
get
the
constitutional
benefit
that
we
seek
here.
now
this
court
has
rejected
however
the
territorial
court
argument
whenever
it
has
been
made
to
deprive
a
district
of
columbia
litigant
of
a
constitutional
right.
i
go
back
for
example
to
callan
v.
wilson.
the
first
case
in
this
court
dealing
with
the
constitutional
rights
of
the
citizens
of
the
district
of
columbia,
that
case
involved
article
iii,
section
2
trial
by
jury
and
the
sixth
amendment
trial
by
jury
and
the
argument
was
made.
the
district
of
columbia
is
like
a
territory
there
is
plenary
legislative
power,
you
don't
get
the
constitutional
right
and
this
court
rejected
that
argument.
it
rejected
the
territorial
analogy
in
holding
that
judge
o'donoghue's
salary
could
not
be
reduced
during
his
tenure
in
his
office
and
as
recently
as
last
month
this
court
distinguished
the
territorial
courts
created
under
article
iv
from
the
district
of
columbia
courts
created
under
article
3.
mr.
frank
f.
flegal
yes.
so
that
the
point
i
am
making
is
whether
they
were
article
4
courts
exercising
article
4
powers
and
thereby
the
litigants
were
not
entitled
to
claim
an
article
3
right.
or
whether
as
justice
harlan
suggested
in
his
plurality
opinion
in
glidden
they
were
exercising
article
iii
power
but
exempt
from
the
good
behavior
tenure.
it
does
not
have
controlling
bearing
on
this
case.
now
what
then
is
left?
what
is
left
of
course,
is
the
plenary
legislative
power
of
congress
over
the
district
of
columbia
and
in
the
course
of
discussing
the
territorial
court
cases,
i
have
already
outlined
of
course
our
position
on
that.
the
district
of
columbia
is
permanent,
this
court
has
already
held
that
each
time
a
constitutional
right
was
claimed
to
be
denied
because
to
a
litigant
because
the
district
of
columbia
was
somehow
unique.
this
court
has
rejected
that
argument.
mr.
frank
f.
flegal
no,
not
that
i
know
off
your
honor.
my
point
is
that
the
citizens
of
the
district
of
columbia
before
the
federal
courts
have
all
of
the
rights
of
the
original
constitution
and
the
amendments,
whether
or
not
the
territorial
litigants
were
deprived
of
the
right
we
seek
here
by
virtue
of
a
fourth
amendment
theory
or
an
article
iii
temporary
status
theory.
but
we
don't
think
its
determinative.
mr.
frank
f.
flegal
yes
sir,
indeed
so
because
of
course
that
is
essential
to
our
proposition.
the
government
has
not
argued
otherwise
but
let
me
just
briefly
address
that
right
now
your
honor.
the
earliest
case
--
mr.
frank
f.
flegal
article
iii
power,
of
course,
because
if
our
case
did
not
arise
under
article
iii
we
haven't
got
any
way
to
bring
direct
--
mr.
frank
f.
flegal
that's
correct
the
only
power
that
we
seek
to
invoke
here
is
the
law
of
the
united
states.
so
there
was
nothing
to
do
with
any
other
of
the
matters
to
which
the
judicial
power
extends.
it
has
been
repeatedly
held,
both
in
the
decisions
of
this
court
and
in
decisions
of
the
early
district
of
columbia
courts,
going
back
as
early
as
1805
an
opinion
which
chief
justice
marshall
participated
while
sitting
on
circuit
that
laws
applicable
exclusively
to
the
district
of
columbia
are
laws
of
the
united
states.
indeed
they
must
be
so
or
this
court
could
not
review
a
local
matter
as
it
has
historically
done
that
was
not
otherwise
presented
with
a
constitutional
issue.
as
recently
for
example,
as
1965
i
believe
it
was
this
court
decided
purely
on
a
basis
of
statutory
construction
a
tax
matter
arising
out
of
the
district
of
columbia
taxing
statutes.
of
course
the
only
power
this
court
would
have
to
construe
that
statute
and
it
was
not
a
constitutional
claim,
it
was
a
statutory
claim
would
be
if
that'
statute
was
a
law
of
the
united
states.
the
first
chief
judge
of
the
local
courts
in
the
district
of
columbia,
chief
judge
crench
(ph)
who
also
--
mr.
frank
f.
flegal
why
do
i
say
that
this
court
could
not
because
no
other
power
in
article
iii
would
purport
to
give
this
court
the
power
to
construe
a
statute
that
was
not
a
statute
of
the
united
states,
a
law
of
the
united
states
or
--
mr.
frank
f.
flegal
well
in
diversity
cases
of
course,
then
you
have
a
power,
if
the
case
arises
that
diversity
of
citizenship,
the
status
of
the
parties
confers
jurisdiction
to
deal
with
the
case
in
controversy
and
issue
between
them
regardless
of
the
nature
of
the
suit
but
the
district
of
columbia
against
general
motors
which
is
the
case
i
referred
to
was
not
a
diversity
suit.
it
came
to
this
court
with
no
other
basis
for
article
iii
jurisdiction
except
the
construction
of
the
statute.
we
have
collected
in
our
brief,
similar
cases
which
go
back
through
the
19th
century
and
we
have
cited
in
our
brief
from
the
very
first
territorial
court
case
incidentally.
american
insurance
company
v.
canter
the
statement
of
mr.
justice
johnson
who
sat
on
circuit
on
that
case
that
if
law
is
applicable
to
exclusively
to
the
district
of
columbia
are
not
laws
of
the
united
states,
this
court,
the
supreme
court
has
no
power
to
review
them.
and
in
the
course
of
that
argument
he
rejected
that
proposition
and
said,
laws
applicable
exclusively
to
the
district
of
columbia
are
laws
of
the
united
states.
the
question
then
finally
arises
is
there
something
in
the
plenary
legislative
power
given
congress
under
section
17
rather
clause
17
of
the
article
i,
section
8,
the
so
called
plenary
power
over
the
district
of
columbia
that
somehow
relates
to
the
constitutional
right
at
stake
here.
we
say
not,
we
say
not
for
two
reasons.
first,
that
plenary
power
is
not
limited
to
the
district
of
columbia.
that's
the
power
that
provides
not
only
for
exclusive
legislation
over
the
seat
of
government
but
also
of
course
federal
enclaves
and
forts
out
in
several
states
so
that
this
argument
is
not
strictly
limited
to
the
district
of
columbia.
beyond
that
this
court
has
always
held
and
i
think
correctly
that
when
you
are
dealing
with
the
exclusive
and
the
plenary
legislative
power
of
congress
that
may
mean
congress
is
free
of
any
other
restriction
in
article
i
but
it
does
not
exempts
congress
from
other
provision
in
the
body
or
the
bill
of
rights
of
the
constitution.
mr.
frank
f.
flegal
indeed
they
do
sir.
and
the
pains
that
they
went
through
is
embodied
in
of
course
clause
17
of
section
8
of
article
i
and
that
is
the
plenary
legislative
and
i
underlined
that
word
legislative
power
given
congress
that
means
--
mr.
frank
f.
flegal
oh!
clearly,
if
a
state
--
mr.
frank
f.
flegal
now
that's
where
we
disagree.
our
proposition
is
the
district
of
columbia
of
course
is
not
a
state.
the
seat
of
government
was
a
state
at
one
time
and
it
was
maryland
in
virginia.
it
was
seated
to
an
exclusive
federal
jurisdiction
attached
in
1801
under
the
session
act.
at
that
point,
congress
is
not
strictly
speaking
a
state
legislature.
this
court
has
already
held
that
congress
is
barren
by
provisions
which
don't
bind
a
state
legislature
when
dealing
with
local
matters.
i
refer
again
to
the
fifth
amendment
grand
jury
indictment
and
the
article
iii
and
the
sixth
amendment
right
to
a
jury
trial.
a
state
legislature
is
not
bound
by
those
provisions.
congress
when
acting
and
legislating
locally
for
the
district
of
columbia
is
--
mr.
frank
f.
flegal
indeed
sir.
we
are
claiming
the
same
safeguard
that
this
court
referred
to
in
the
court
martial
case
is
starting
with
toth,
o'callahan,
lark,
o'donoghue,
this
is
the
right
of
the
federal
litigant,
this
is
the
right
we
claim.
indeed
we
think
the
colts
case
which
is
282
united
states
cited
in
our
brief
is
directly
on
point.
in
that
case,
in
our
local
case
arising
out
of
the
district
of
columbia,
this
courts
squarely
held
that
a
local
litigant
was
entitled
to
the
safeguards
of
section
2
of
article
3,
the
jury
trial.
there
is
no
reference
in
the
colts
case
to
the
sixth
amendment,
purely
section
2
article
3.
mr.
frank
f.
flegal
yes,
under
the
constitution,
your
honor,
the
appointment
of
officers
of
the
judges
can
also
be
vested
in
the
president
alone,
without
conformation
or
in
the
head
of
the
department.
mr.
frank
f.
flegal
yes.
mr.
frank
f.
flegal
the
reason
that
bids
me
to
say
that
your
honor
is
there
is
nothing
else
in
the
appointing
part
of
article
2
that
distinguishes
judges
from
those
inferior
officers.
in
other
words,
article
2
reads
that
unless
congress
shall
by
law
otherwise
provide
the
presidential
appoint
and
the
congress
shall
give
their
advice
in
consent
but
by
law
congress
may
vest
the
appointment
of
the
inferior
officers
in
the
present
law
and
order
in
ahead
of
a
department.
now
the
final,
of
course,
question
raised
by
this
case
is
whether
or
not,
we
were
entitled
to
have
our
notion
to
suppress
granted
by
a
constitutional
judge
or
by
a
non-constitutional
judge,
that
is
a
separate
issue
and
it's
an
issue
equally
dis-positive
of
this
case;
for
on
this
record
without
the
evidence
we
sought
to
have
suppress,
there
is
no
evidence
to
support
appellant's
conviction.
that
requires,
of
course,
written
briefly
in
the
facts.
they
are
not
in
dispute.
at
the
trial
court,
appellant
and
his
witness
gave
a
different
version
of
this
encounter
than
did
the
police
officers.
we
have
not
contained
it
on
appeal
and
we
do
not
contained
here
that
the
trial
judge
was
bound
to
believe
our
witness
rather
our
position
is
on
the
police
officers
version
of
the
events.
appellants
right
to
be
free
from
unreasonable
seizures
was
violated.
what
were
the
facts?
appellant
was
driving
a
car
by
8'0
clock
in
the
evening
on
the
600
block
of
t-street
in
downtown
washington.
at
that
point
in
time,
he
had
violated
no
law,
no
traffic
ordinance,
he
had
no
apparent
equipment
defect
and
there
is
no
contention,
there
has
been
no
contention
in
any
court
below
and
there
is
no
contention
here,
that
the
officers
were
possessed
of
any
articulable
facts
to
show
that
he
had
been,
was
or
was
about
to
be
engaged
in
any
criminal
conduct.
this
was
a
matter
of
a
specific
finding
by
the
court
of
appeals.
two
plain
clothes
officers
assign
to
the
special
operations
division
of
the
district
of
columbia
police
department
decided
that
they
would
stop
appellant
for
what
has
been
described
in
this
record
as
a
spot-check
or
a
traffic-check
or
in
one
place,
a
rental
agreement
check.
they
turned
on
their
red
lights
and
their
siren
and
they
force
the
appellant
to
the
side
of
the
road.
appellant
produce
the
driver's
license
and
was
asked
to
return
to
the
car
and
obtain
a
copy
of
his
rental
agreement
form
and
i
interject
the
officers
of
plain,
that
they
knew
this
was
a
rental
agreement
car
rather
a
rental
car
because
of
the
special
serial
numbers
on
the
license
plate.
an
officer
was
thereupon
engaged
in
discussing
with
appellant,
an
appellant
discrepancy
in
the
exploration
date
of
his
rental
agreement.
when
a
fellow
officer
who
had
been
on
the
passenger
side
of
the
car
shining
a
flashlight
into
the
interior
discovered
the
gun,
sees
the
gun
and
arrested
appellant.
our
contention
is
at
the
moment
appellant
was
stopped,
at
the
moment
he
was
stopped
for
this
license
at
spot-check,
his
fourth
amendment
rights
against
unreasonable
seizures
had
been
infringed.
it
is
important
to
point
out
that
in
this
case
there
is
no
congressional
statute
which
on
its
face,
purports
to
authorize
police
officers
to
stop
citizens
for
purpose
of
inspecting
either
driver's
licenses
or
motor
vehicle
registrations.
the
statutes
do
require
that
citizens
carry
both
of
those
documents
while
they
operate
a
car.
and
the
driver's
license
statute
does
require
that
a
citizen
display
that
license
to
a
police
officer
but
it
does
not
specifically
provide
that
the
officer
is
entitle
to
stop
in
order
to
ask
for
the
display.
mr.
frank
f.
flegal
our
position
is
that
a
police
officer
acting
without
standards
set
out
by
somebody
either
the
legislature
perhaps
the
commissioners
or
the
district
of
columbia
or
at
least
the
higher
officials
in
the
police
department.
he
cannot
be
left
to
his
own
discretion
to
pick
anybody
else
that
he
wants
out
for
a
spot-check
and
i
say
that
for
this
reason.
on
this
record,
the
officer
who
made
this
spot-check
said
that
i
have
no
basis,
i
have
been
given
no
instructions
as
to
how
or
whom
i
should
stop.
i
think
it's
up
to
me
to
pick
people
out
and
i
pick
rental
cars
because
i
think
a
lot
of
them
are
overdue.
i
want
to
see
if
the
man
can
prove
that
it's
not
overdue
because
it's
a
crime
if
it
is
overdue.
he
also
referred
to
the
fact
that
on
another
occasion
a
fellow
officer
had
found
$6,000
with
of
narcotics
in
a
rental
car.
leaving
it
to
the
unfettered
and
unarticulated
standards
of
the
police
officer
on
the
corner,
simply
poses
too
great
and
too
unreasonable,
a
restriction
with
a
right
of
free
movement.
we
don't
see
in
contemporary
urban
society
any
great
difference
between
walking
down
the
street
and
driving.
mr.
frank
f.
flegal
oh,
clearly,
clearly,
but
i
am
talking
in
terms
of
justifiable
expectation
of
privacy.
you
may
will
have
to
submit
to
reasonable
and
perhaps
spot-checks
but
the
question
is
not
is
at
spot-check,
that's
what
we
think
the
court
below
made
the
mistake.
the
question
is,
is
this
a
reasonable
spot-check
and
we
say
when
it
is
done
on
an
individual
basis
by
a
police
officer
given
no
standards
by
anybody,
stopping
them
for
his
own
reasons,
that's
what
makes
it
unreasonable.
i
think
i
should
call
to
the
courts
attention,
the
case
which
was
decided
in
the
supreme
court
of
pennsylvania
and
we
were
unable
to
include
it
in
our
brief
so
that
we
will
shortly
do
so
in
a
formal
amendment.
you
know
we
only
get
the
opinion
yesterday,
the
supreme
court
of
pennsylvania,
the
case
is
commonwealth
against
swanger
has
since
squarely
so
held.
it
is
simply
unreasonable
for
police
officers
acting
on
their
own
to
stop
for
spot-checks
and
the
pennsylvania
case,
if
anything
there
was
a
much
more
compelling
state
requirement
because
pennsylvania
had
a
statute,
the
case
is
based
squarely
on
the
fourth
amendment,
squarely
on
the
principles
in
(inaudible).
mr.
frank
f.
flegal
i
think
that
gets
to
be
a
closer
case
to
reasonable,
your
honor,
because
now
you
have
had
a
responsible
determination
by
the
police
chief
or
the
traffic
chief
whoever
he
is,
you
have
given
a
police
officer
on
the
corner
a
basis
to
do
it.
so
he
is
not
doing
it
because
he
thinks
rental
cars
are
overdue,
because
there
might
be
narcotics
and
you
have
told
them
how
to
do
it.
mr.
frank
f.
flegal
not
random
--
where
the
basis
for
the
random
selection
is
left
to
the
individual
judgment
of
the
officer
that's
the
narrow
point
we
make
on
this
case.
we
have
nothing
to
argue
here
about
what
would
happen
if
the
police
chief
said
every
50th
car
or
today
is
yellow
cars,
or
something
of
that
nature,
that's
the
next
case
but
our
case
is
leaving
it
to
the
unfettered
judgment
of
the
officer
on
the
corner
and
we
think
and
we
think
this
record
shows,
that
is
simply
runs
too
high
of
a
risk.
mr.
frank
f.
flegal
for
driverâ€™s
licenses
or
somewhat?
mr.
frank
f.
flegal
yes,
alright
that
becomes
a
different
case,
again,
they
have
got
a
basis,
they
have
given
the
officer
some
standards
and
perhaps
you'd
have
a
different
case,
i
think
it's
important
here
to
have
one
other
factor
and
that
is
that
in
this
case,
the
only
safety
matter
really
is
the
driver's
license.
it
was
not
even
set
forth
as
the
officer
is
a
basis
for
the
stop,
that
document
was
produced
at
the
outset
of
the
stop,
returned
and
appellant
was
not
free
to
go
at
that
point
in
time.
in
other
words,
this
officer
on
this
record
is
using
his
power
to
make
traffic
checks
to
see
whether
or
not
you
can
prove
a
rental
car
is
overdue
and
of
course,
it's
the
officers
also
conceded
they
have
a
list
of
overdue
in
stolen
cars
and
this
car
was
not
on
that
list.
mr.
frank
f.
flegal
of
course,
our
proposition
in
this
case,
your
honor,
is
what
they
initially
did.
we
make
no
contention
that
if
they
had
a
right
to
stop
appellant
under
the
circumstances
shown
on
this
record
that
what
they
did
thereafter
made
it
unreasonable,
our
contention
is
they
could
not
under
the
circumstances
of
this
case
stop
him
at
the
outset.
mr.
frank
f.
flegal
i
am
sorry,
perhaps
i
didn't
understand
your
honor's
question.
mr.
frank
f.
flegal
abounding
a
traffic.
mr.
frank
f.
flegal
right.
mr.
frank
f.
flegal
not
doing
something
about,
your
honor,
the
fourth
amendment
doesn't
say
they
can't
do
anything
about
it.
it
says
that
if
you
infringe
the
defendant's
fourth
amendment
right
in
getting
to
the
position
and
stopping
the
car,
then
you
can
introduce
that
piece
of
evidence.
it
doesnâ€™t
mean
of
course
you
can
release
the
child.
mr.
frank
f.
flegal
my
position
would
be
the
same.
the
admission
of
the
gun
or
the
admission
of
the
body
does
not
make
a
distinction.
for
this
reason
it
is
our
position
that
the
judgment
below
should
be
reversed
and
with
the
court
belief
i
will
save
my
remaining
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
frank
f.
flegal
i
appreciate
that
your
honor.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
one
central
point
that
is
now
involved
in
the
case
is
the
positions
of
the
parties
have
crystallized,
is
whether
or
not
the
citizens
of
the
district
of
columbia
stand
on
a
different
footing
insofar
as
article
3
safeguards
and
protections
are
concerned
from
citizens
in
the
several
states.
we
think
the
answer
to
that
dis-positive
question
is
no.
we
rely
first
upon
the
fact
that
the
constitution
required
the
district
of
columbia
to
be
carved
out
of
the
several
states.
mr.
frank
f.
flegal
oh,
clearly
your
honor.
the
legislature
which
enacts
the
laws
for
the
citizens
of
the
district
of
columbia
and
of
course
those
who
come
into
the
district
of
columbia
is
congress
or
whatever
local
legislature
it
is.
mr.
frank
f.
flegal
that
is
a
legislative
difference
and
we
suggest
it
has
no
extension
to
article
3
safeguards
and
protections.
as
i
was
indicating
the
district
of
columbia
had
to
be
carved
out
of
the
several
states.
that
was
a
factor
which
this
court
found
dis-positive
in
the
o'donoghue
opinion
upon
which
we
place
heavy
reliance
and
i
would
respectfully
disagree
with
the
solicitor
general
that
i
think
if
the
appellant
does
not
prevail
in
this
case
at
least
some
of
the
language,
some
of
the
article
iii
theory
of
the
rights
and
the
benefits
set
forth
in
the
o'donoghue
opinion
would
have
to
be
rejected
or
retreated
from.
now
--
mr.
frank
f.
flegal
precisely,
your
honor.
mr.
frank
f.
flegal
and
the
difference
is
the
difference
between
the
fourteenth
amendment
which
is
the
state's
federal
constitution
restriction
on
a
state
legislature
and
the
bill
of
rights
and
original
constitution
on
congress.
mr.
frank
f.
flegal
yes
indeed
so
sir,
indeed
so
and
i
say
that
because
this
court
has
so
held.
many
rights
which
citizens
of
a
state
and
which
are
not,
which
don't
fetter
a
state
legislature's
judgment,
the
seventh
amendment
right
to
a
trial
by
jury
in
a
civil
case,
the
sixth
amendment
and
article
iii
right
to
a
jury
trial
in
the
criminal
case
and
the
fifth
amendment
grand
jury
right
are
applicable
to
local
offenses
in
the
district
of
columbia.
to
that
extent
we
submit
--
mr.
frank
f.
flegal
and
in
the
territories,
your
honor,
depending
upon
whether
or
not
the
territory
is
been
incorporated
or
not
and
whether
it's
being
fundamental
or
not,
those
are
--
mr.
frank
f.
flegal
itâ€™s
been
assumed
your
honor,
i
know
of
no
case
in
this
court
which
is
ever
squarely
so
held
--
mr.
frank
f.
flegal
it
would
make
no
difference
to
me,
your
honor.
we
would
the
submit
the
citizens
before
the
federal
court
in
the
district
of
columbia
charged
with
a
felony
is
entitled
to
precisely
the
same.
constitutional
rights
and
safeguards
as
a
citizen
charged
for
a
federal
felony
before
a
federal
tribunal
in
one
of
several
states
and
we
think
the
framers
did
accomplish
something
by
the
good
behavior
clause
of
the
constitution
something
benefited
to
the
litigants.
mr.
frank
f.
flegal
i
am
giving
the
residents
of
the
district
of
columbia
precisely
the
same
as
i
would
give
the
resident
of
maryland
and
that
is
the
right
--
mr.
frank
f.
flegal
correct.
mr.
frank
f.
flegal
weren't
tried
before
the
state
tribunals,
and
they
get
a
precisely
the
same
--
mr.
frank
f.
flegal
several
other
states,
but
that
is
a
question
on
which
we
--
a
fact
on
which
we
place
no
reliance
for
our
proposition.
what
we
are
saying
is
the
citizen
in
the
district
of
columbia
gets
rights
which
the
state
of
court
would
not
have
to
afford
him
sitting
in
maryland,
the
grand
jury
indictment
the
jury
and
we
submit
the
good
behavior
judge.
mr.
frank
f.
flegal
that's
the
arguendo
assumption
your
honor,
if
the
governments
we
think
that
goes
too
far
and
if
there
are
serious
problems
if
congress
ever
passed
the
hypothetical
legislation
that
the
government
state
court
argument
rest
upon,
this
court
is
confronted
some
of
those
problems
in
the
seventh
amendment
context,
with
the
state
courts
trying
federal
civil
actions
and
in
some
cases
the
federal
employer
liability
acts
in
so
forth,
implied
as
part
of
the
remedy.
some
part
of
the
seventh
amendment
jury
protection,
but
that's
not
our
argument.
we
assume
arguendo
with
the
government
that
if
state
courts
could
constitutionally
try
federal
clients
fourteenth
amendment
protections
would
apply.
our
preposition
is
purely
a
limitation
on
exercise
of
the
federal
judicial
power.
if
court
has
no
further
questions,
we
submit
that
the
judgment
of
the
district
of
columbia
court
of
appeal
should
be
reversed
either
with
directions
to
remand
this
case
for
a
new
trial
before
a
constitutional
court,
or
in
the
alternative
to
reverse
and
remand
for
either
a
new
trial
or
a
judgment
of
acquittal,
excluding
the
evidence
which
we
challenge.
thank
your
honor.
mr.
frank
f.
flegal
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
on
february
the
1st,
1971
the
district
of
columbia
court
reorganization
act
became
effective.
among
other
things
that
act
created
the
superior
court
of
the
district
of
columbia,
a
court
and
its
judges
hold
office
for
limited
terms
and
vested
jurisdiction
in
that
court
to
hear
and
determine
certain
felony
charges
brought
by
the
united
states
of
america
against
persons
accused
violating
acts
of
congress
applicable
exclusively
to
the
district
of
columbia.
the
courts
below
and
the
parties
have
tended
to
call
such
acts,
local
statutes.
on
february
23rd
of
1971,
appellant
was
indicted
in
the
superior
court
for
violation
of
such
a
statute.
the
crime
of
carrying
a
dangerous
weapon,
in
this
case,
a
gun
without
a
permit
having
been
issued
in
accordance
with
law.
since
appellant
had
previously
been
convicted
of
another
and
an
unrelated
felony
and
that
prior
conviction
is
not
an
issue
here.
the
charge
against
him
was
a
felony
charge,
if
convicted
he
stood
do
face
imprisonment
for
up
to
ten
years.
prior
to
trial
appellant
challenged
the
jurisdiction
of
the
superior
court.
he
claimed
that
he
was
entitled
to
have
his
case
heard
and
determined
by
a
constitutional
court
that
is
of
course,
a
court
was
then
been
established
in
accordance
with
article
iii
and
presided
over
by
a
judge
holding
office
during
good
behavior.
mr.
frank
f.
flegal
yes
sir
it
was.
mr.
frank
f.
flegal
yes,
indeed
so
sir.
we
make
a
distinction
here
and
let
me
just
briefly
elude
to
it
now
and
then
when
we
get
to
the
argument
address
it
in
full.
historically,
as
this
court
is
dealt
with
in
the
article
iii
jury
trial
cases.
there
has
been
a
distinction
between
minor
or
petty
cases.
historically,
as
this
court
pointed
out
in
the
clawans
case,
300
united
states.
english
judges
prior
to
the
adoption
of
the
constitution,
judges
not
of
the
general
jurisdiction
of
england,
held
and
heard
and
determine
minor
matters
involving
up
to
one
year
imprisonment.
congress
has
always
assumed
that
to
be
the
case
in
the
district
of
columbia
and
indeed
nor
has
magistrates
in
the
several
states,
non
article
iii
officers
hearing
such
minor
matters.
for
purposes
of
our
argument
we
assume
that
there
is
a
class
of
matter
and
we
assume
although
this
court
has
never
decided
that
a
misdemeanor
and
one
year
is
the
appropriate
constitutional
judgement.
there
is
a
historical
basis
for
that.
mr.
frank
f.
flegal
indeed
there
maybe
--
mr.
frank
f.
flegal
in
any
event
whatever
the
law
and
event,
a
felony
is
our
proposition
in
this
case.
after
that
motion
was
overruled,
the
trial
court
proceeded
to
consider
appellants
motion
to
suppress
evidence
which
was
based
upon
appellants
fourth
amendment
contention
that
the
method
by
which
police
officers
obtained
the
evidence
in
this
case,
the
gun,
was
a
result
of
an
unreasonable
seizure
of
appellants
purse.
the
court
heard
evidence
and
i
put
aside
for
the
moment
the
details
of
that
evidence
so
that
it
would
be
freshly
at
hand
when
returned
to
the
fourth
amendment
argument,
fourth
amendment
position
later
in
the
argument
and
having
heard
that
evidence
overruled
appellant's
objection.
appellant
elected
to
stand
on
the
legal
issue
which
had
been
raised
and
trial
by
jury
having
been
waived,
the
trial
court
found
appellant
guilty
of
the
charge
against
it.
he
was
subsequently
sentenced
to
from
2-6
years
in
prison.
execution
of
the
sentence
was
suspended
except
for
180
days
imprisonment
on
condition
of
six
years
probation.
an
appeal
was
taken
to
the
district
of
columbia
court
of
appeals
and
that
court
affirmed
the
judgement.
thereafter
appellant
review
was
sought
in
this
court.
we
sought
review
by
filing
a
notice
of
appeal
in
the
district
of
columbia
court
of
appeals
and
docketing
a
jurisdictional
statement
in
this
court.
on
october
10,
1972
this
court
entered
an
order
placing
this
case
on
its
hearing
calendar
but
postponing
the
question
of
jurisdiction
until
the
argument
of
the
case
on
the
merits.
accordingly
i
return
to
that
threshold
question.
strictly
speaking
of
course,
it
is
not
a
question
of
this
courts
appellate
jurisdiction.
for
all
parties
can
see
that
this
court
has
a
jurisdiction
to
review
the
judgement
of
the
district
of
columbia
court
of
appeals
in
this
case.
the
question
is
rather
a
statutory
question.
the
mode
or
the
manner
by
which
we
should
have
invoked
this
court's
appellate
jurisdiction.
it
is
our
contention
that
when
congress
as
it
has
done
in
the
district
of
columbia
courts,
creates
a
local
court
system
and
vest
that
local
court
system
with
jurisdiction
to
hear
local
matters
and
provides
that
appeals
from
the
highest
local
court
shall
we
taken
to
this
court
in
accordance
with
the
general
provision
of
section
1257
of
the
judicial
court.
locally
applicable
laws
constitute
a
law
of
a
state
within
the
meaning
of
1257
subdivision
2.
for
that
proposition
we
place
of
course,
principal
reliance
on
the
analogous
case
of
balzac
against
porto
rico,
decided
50
years
ago
where
congress
provided
the
judgments
of
the
supreme
court
of
porto
rico
would
be
reviewed
in
this
court,
in
accordance
with
1257
and
the
issue
in
balzac
was
whether
or
not
a
statute
applicable
exclusively
to
porto
rico
was
there
by
dimmed
to
be
a
statute
of
a
state.
in
a
unanimous
opinion
written
by
chief
justice
taft,
this
court
held
that
it
was.
now
it's
quite
as
the
government
points
out
that
the
legislature
that
had
enacted
the
statute
in
balzac
was
a
territorial
legislature
not
the
united
states
congress
but
that
fact
played
no
articulable
part
in
this
court's
opinion.
rather
the
chief
justice
focused
on
the
manifesting
intent
of
congress.
a
point
of
course,
which
this
court
reiterated
just
last
month
in
the
canter
case,
the
intent
of
congress
in
enacting
and
providing
for
such
a
method
of
review.
for
reason
set
forth
in
balzac
and
articulated
in
our
opinion,
we
think
this
case
is
properly
heard
on
appeal.
at
the
outset
of
course,
by
the
filing
right
jurisdiction
papers
and
again
in
our
brief
we
have
invoked
in
the
alternative,
the
certiorari
jurisdiction
of
this
court
in
the
even
that
we
are
on.
but
of
course,
having
the
case
here
whether
by
certiorari
or
appeal
does
not
answer
the
question
which
was
raised
and
overruled
in
the
trial
court.
was
appellant
entitled
to
have
his
case
heard
and
determined
by
a
constitutional
court?
article
iii
discussions
tend
frequently
to
become
academic
and
there
are
several
nuances
in
article
iii
issues
and
the
parties
have
pursued
those
in
their
brief.
mr.
frank
f.
flegal
here
is
nothing
to
do
with
the
answer
of
the
second.
first
question
is
purely
a
statutory
construction.
mr.
frank
f.
flegal
certiorari
â€“
mr.
frank
f.
flegal
completely
unrelated,
it's
the
mode
of
seeking
review
the
statutory
mode
and
it's
purely
a
question
of
statutory
interpretation.
on
the
merits
however,
it.
mr.
frank
f.
flegal
for
purposes
of
a
statute,
your
honor,
not
for
purposes
of
article
iii
section
one
of
the
constitution.
mr.
frank
f.
flegal
that
is
the
question.
excuse
me,
of
course,
that
is
the
question
on
the
first
proposition
the
appeal
as
opposed
to
certiorari.
mr.
frank
f.
flegal
indeed
i
answer.
indeed
i
am
suggesting.
mr.
frank
f.
flegal
i
do
get
different
answers
and
i
say
that
because
under
the
statute
the
question
of
course
is
purely
one
of
statutory
construction
what
did
congress
intent
under
article
iii
of
the
constitution.
we
have
of
course
a
constitutional
issue
what
did
the
framers
mean
and
it
is
not
conceded.
the
government
does
not
oppose
the
proposition,
that
went
in
the
meaning
of
article
iii
of
the
constitution
and
act
of
congress
that
will
be
if
one
applicable
only
to
the
district
of
columbia
is
of
course,
a
law
of
the
united
states.
that's
the
only
basis
by
which
this
court's
appellate
jurisdiction
from
the
beginning
of
the
republic
with
respect
to
local
district
of
columbia
matters
not
otherwise
involving
a
constitutional
issue
can
be
sustained.
our
preposition
is
that
the
article
iii
protection
for
the
independence
of
the
federal
judge
that
is
the
good
behavior
tenure
and
the
associated
constitutional
restrictions
control
of
course,
important
rights
on
the
judge.
but
principally
an
important
claim
for
purposes
of
this
case,
they
also
confer
rights
and
benefits
and
safeguard
on
the
litigants.
now
that
is
a
preposition
which
the
government
contested
at
the
outset
of
this
case.
at
the
threshold
stage,
the
government
suggested
that
we
did
not
have
standing
to
raise
this
issue.
they
have
abandoned
that
in
their
brief
and
i
think
properly
so.
this
court
has
addressed
the
meaning
of
the
good
behavior
clause
as
it
effects
litigants.
time
and
again,
and
what
i
don't
want
to
deliver
the
point,
i
want
to
emphasize
two
cases
on
which
we
principally
rely
and
that
is
of
course,
the
o'donoghue
case
where
this
court
trace
the
meaning
of
article
iii
with
respect
to
litigants.
in
o'donoghue
this
court
referred
for
example,
to
one
of
the
specific
complaints
which
desires
of
the
declaration
had
made.
the
judges
were
being
limited
in
their
tenure
and
having
their
salaries
reduced
and
in
o'donoghue
and
again
in
lark
and
the
court-martial
cases.
parker
and
o'callahan.
mr.
frank
f.
flegal
o'donoghue
was
a
judge,
your
honor.
however
toth
and
o'callahan
were
litigants
as
was
larkin
the
litigant
in
the
companion
case
in
glidden
v.
zdanok
and
in
lark,
this
court
referred
to
the
protection
designed
in
part
for
the
protection
of
the
litigant
and
that
is
the
protection
which
we
saught.
mr.
frank
f.
flegal
that
was
the
plurality
opinion,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
frank
f.
flegal
the
plurality
opinion
by
mr.
justice
harlan.
mr.
frank
f.
flegal
not
a
court
opinion
in
lark.
of
course,
it
is
mr.
justice
black's
plurality
opinion
in
part,
a
court
opinion
in
o'callahan,
all
dealing
with
litigants
and
all
referring
to
the
right
by
the
contort
on
the
litigant.
now,
of
course,
there
can
be
no
contention
here
as
was
the
issue
in
lark
that
appellant
did
receive
an
article
3
judge.
the
judge
that
presided
in
our
trial
holds
office
for
15
years,
not
good
behavior.
he
is
not
subject
to
protection
from
diminishment
of
his
salary
and
he
is
not
answerable
only
to
the
other
branches
of
government
through
the
impeachment
process,
he
is
answerable
to
a
commission.
the
commission
on
judicial
disabilities
and
tenure
which
consists
of
five
members,
three
of
them
are
appointed
by
the
president
of
the
united
states.
the
fourth
by
the
mayor
commissioner
of
the
district
of
columbia
who
in
turn,
of
course,
is
appointed
by
the
president
and
the
fifth,
by
the
chief
judge
of
the
district
court.
any
four
members
of
that
commission
have
power
after
holding
appropriate
proceedings
to
remove
the
judge
and
if
he
is
removed,
if
a
commission
order
is
entered,
his
salary
instantly
stops,
pending
his
resort
to
judicial
review
and
his
judicial--
mr.
frank
f.
flegal
somewhat,
yes,
quite
like
a
state,
your
honor
but
of
course,
totally
foreign
to
article
3.
the
review
is
sought
by
firing
and
notice
of
appeal
with
your
honor,
who
is
there
upon
called
to
designate
a
special
three-judge
tribunal
consisting
on
circuit
and/or
district
judges
to
finally
hear
and
determine.
so,
thanks
to
the
right
we
claimed.
mr.
frank
f.
flegal
at
least
with
respect
to
the
other
two
branches
of
government,
your
honor.
it
is
not
add
issue
in
this
case
as
to
whether
within
the
judicial
branch
the
chamber
problems,
whether
there
is
within
the
judicial
branch
some
power
of
superintendence
of
the
performance
of
lower
court
or
inferior
judges.
our
proposition
is
that
the
impeachment
clause
is
the
only
way
the
other
branches
of
government
can
oversee
the
performance
of
judges.
mr.
frank
f.
flegal
oh,
of
course,
of
course
and
it
is
a
question
which
is
not
raised
in
that
case.
there
is
no
question
here
that
the
judicial
disabilities
and
tenure
commission
is
a
body
of
good
behavior
judges
but
our
proposition
turns
on
the
other
two
branches
of
government,
not
the
judiciary,
your
honor.
mr.
frank
f.
flegal
it
is
not
a
wholly
established
principle,
that's
right
and
so--
mr.
frank
f.
flegal
precisely,
your
honor,
precisely
and
of
course,
there
is
no
holding
--
mr.
frank
f.
flegal
yes,
the
question
then
arises,
are
we
entitled
to
this
right?
if
article
3
safeguards
and
benefits
mean
anything,
if
the
founders
did
not
accomplish
a
fruitless
act
in
so
far
as
litigants
are
concerned,
then
of
course,
we
contend
that
the
felony
class
of
case
has
to
be
included
within
these
protections.
in
other
words,
if
anyone
is
to
get
these
benefits
other
than
perhaps
judges,
if
any
litigant
is
a
felony
litigant
must
have
them
because
no
other
place
that
we
can
conceive
would
rise
to
greater
constitutional
dignity.
perhaps
others,
perhaps
constitutional
questions
would
be
similar
but
nothing
would
be
higher.
then
why,
according
to
the
courts
below
and
the
government
are
we
not
entitled
to
this
constitutional
protection.
the
government
suggests
that
there
is
no
requirement
in
article
3
that
congress
afford
this
constitutional
right
to
any
litigant
and
the
government
supports
this
proposition
by
suggesting
that
with
respect
to
at
least
any
one
of
the
enumerated
legislative
powers
of
congress
and
this
is
an
argument
which
is
not
limited
to
the
district
of
columbia,
either
in
the
district
or
in
the
several
states,
congress
may
create
a
so-called
legislative
court,
a
non-constitutional
court
and
thereby
deprive
us
of
the
benefits
and
safeguards
to
which
this
court
has
repeatedly
referred.
mr.
frank
f.
flegal
oh
precisely,
it
is
not
a
fourteenth
amendment
benefit
and
safeguard
at
all,
your
honor
and
we
don't
contend
that
it
is.
mr.
frank
f.
flegal
right,
our
contention,
of
course,
is
that
the
original
constitution
and
certain
protections
in
the
first
ten
amendments,
for
example,
grand
jury
indictment
article
3
in
sixth
amendment
trial
by
jury
are
of
course
rights
which
are
afforded
litigants
when
the
federal
judicial
powers
brought
to
bed,
not
necessarily
required
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
in
the
states.
we
make
no
contention
that
there
is
anything
fundamentally
unfair
in
the
fourteenth
amendment
sense
about
having
judges
with
limited
tenure.
our
proposition
is
the
framers
gave
a
right
in
article
3
beyond
that,
which
fourteenth
amendment
due
process
would
require
to
be
afforded.
government
says
that
because
under
the
supremacy
clause,
congress
could
argue
and
though
require
state
courts
to
hear
and
determine
federal
felonies
thatâ€™s
the
end
of
the
inquiry.
if
they
can
require
this
case
to
be
heard
in
a
state
court,
the
government
argues.
then
of
course,
a
state
court
judge
following
up
on
your
honor's
proposition
would
not
hold
life
tenure
and
why
are
we
entitled
to
it?
i
suggest
the
distinction
which
your
honor's
question
focuses
is
precisely
the
fallacy
of
the
government's
argument.
in
the
first
place,
when
a
state
court
hears
a
case,
whether
or
not
that
case
arises
under
state
law
or
arises
out
of
an
active
congress
which
the
state
is
enforcing
under
the
supremacy
clause,
the
state
is
exercising
the
state's
judicial
power,
not
the
judicial
power
of
the
united
states
and
article
3
by
its
terms
is
a
limitation
on
federal
not
state
judicial
power
and
taken
one
step
further,
the
proposition
that
was
addressed
by
the
chief
justice's
question,
the
government's
position
puts
federal
courts
on
the
plain
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
the
government's
argument
carried
to
its
logical
extension,
create
a
non-article
3
court
because
you
could
create
a
state,
you
could
require
a
state
court
to
do
it,
means
that
any
right
that
a
federal
defendant
has
that
a
fourteenth
amendment
defendant
in
the
state
court
does
not
have
could
be
deprived
and
i
don't
think
that
is
the
law,
i
don't
think
the
congress
can
deprive
a
federal
litigant
of
a
grand
jury
enticement,
even
though
a
state
may
not
have
to
provide
it
or
of
an
article
3
jury
or
of
an
article
3
judge.
what
then
does
the
government
argue
beyond
that?
the
government
relies,
of
course,
on
the
legislative
court
cases.
the
government
says
that
there
is
a
judicial
power
outside
of
article
3
which
is
co-extensive
with
that
conferred
in
article
3.
this
court
has
never
so
held,
this
court
has
never
so
held.
in
the
permanent
part
of
the
united
states,
this
court
has
always
carefully
looked
at
the
nature
of
the
matter
being
adjudicated
by
the
so-called
legislative
court
and
if
that
matter
was
a
subject
for
which
the
litigant
had
to
right
to
claim
judicial
determination,
if
it
was
subject
to
being
disposed
off
by
exercise
of
another
power,
legislative
or
executive,
then
the
court
has
said,
it
is
permissible
to
have
the
matter
adjudicated
in
a
legislative
court.
there
has
never
been
even
a
piece
of
dicta
in
one
of
this
court's
legislative
court
cases
which
would
suggest
that
a
non-article
3
court
could
hear
and
determine
a
felony
and
impose
a
felony
punishment.

it
is
an
interesting
question
on
theory,
your
honor.
justice
harlan
and
his
plurality
opinion
in
glidden
against
zdanok
said
yes,
they
were,
that
they
were
article
3
judges
exercising
article
3
judicial
power
but
exempt
because
of
the
peculiar
temporary
status
of
the
territories
from
article
3
tenure
requirement.
mr.
frank
f.
flegal
i
think
what
it
means
â€“
mr.
frank
f.
flegal
i
think
what
it
means
your

i
think
what
justice
harlan
had
in
mind
was
the
nature
of
the
matters
they
were
determining,
where
the
kind
of
matters
including
felonies
which
could
only
be
adjudicated
by
an
article
3
court.
therefore,
they
had
to
be
exercising
the
judicial
power
of
article
3.
mr.
frank
f.
flegal
that
is
right.
he
then
said,
however,
because
of
the
temporary
status
of
the
territories,
they
were
exempt
from
the
good
behavior
clause.
that
more
recently,
this
court
in
the
carter
case
and
back
in
o'
donoghue
said,
they
werenâ€™t
article
3
judges
at
all.
they
were
always
article
4
judges
exercising
the
power
conferred
upon
congress
under
the
territories
clause,
the
acquisition
clause
outside
of
and
this
we
think
is
the
important
point
in
this
case.
mr.

various
proposals
had
been
used
in
the
different
territories,

sometimes,
the

appointed
and
congress
confirmed

other
times,
local

confirmed
the

they
all
said,
for
limited
terms
of

at
the
present

we
have

of

example,
the
president
of
the
united
states
appoints
the
officer
or
official
to
exercise
the
judicial
power.
but
the
critical
point
and
why
we
distinguish
the
territorial
court
cases
is
all
of
those
have
dealt
with
temporary
necessity
out
in
non
permanent
parts
of
the
federal
union.
mr.
frank
f.
flegal
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
frank
f.
flegal
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
frank
f.
flegal
a
way
back
your
honor.
mr.
frank
f.
flegal
right,
perhaps
i
should
have
prefaced
my
statement
as
constitutional
temporary
status.
in
other
words,
the
first
three
articles
of
the
constitution
which
include
the
states
and
the
district
of
columbia,
that's
the
permanent
union.
then
the
territories
may
or
may
not
join
that
union
either
as
states
or
perhaps
under
some
other
arrangement.
but
until
they
do,
they
are
not
constitutionally
permanent.
we
can
sale
the
territory,
relinquish
it,
return
it
to
another
sovereign
and
so
forth.
mr.
frank
f.
flegal
indeed
so,
your
honor
including
capital
punishment,
indeed
so.
mr.
frank
f.
flegal
they
indeed
were
your
honor.
the
litigants
in
the
territorial
court
cases
did
not
get
the
constitutional
benefit
that
we
seek
here.
now
this
court
has
rejected
however
the
territorial
court
argument
whenever
it
has
been
made
to
deprive
a
district
of
columbia
litigant
of
a
constitutional
right.
i
go
back
for
example
to
callan
v.
wilson.
the
first
case
in
this
court
dealing
with
the
constitutional
rights
of
the
citizens
of
the
district
of
columbia,
that
case
involved
article
iii,
section
2
trial
by
jury
and
the
sixth
amendment
trial
by
jury
and
the
argument
was
made.
the
district
of
columbia
is
like
a
territory
there
is
plenary
legislative
power,
you
don't
get
the
constitutional
right
and
this
court
rejected
that
argument.
it
rejected
the
territorial
analogy
in
holding
that
judge
o'donoghue's
salary
could
not
be
reduced
during
his
tenure
in
his
office
and
as
recently
as
last
month
this
court
distinguished
the
territorial
courts
created
under
article
iv
from
the
district
of
columbia
courts
created
under
article
3.
mr.
frank
f.
flegal
yes.
so
that
the
point
i
am
making
is
whether
they
were
article
4
courts
exercising
article
4
powers
and
thereby
the
litigants
were
not
entitled
to
claim
an
article
3
right.
or
whether
as
justice
harlan
suggested
in
his
plurality
opinion
in
glidden
they
were
exercising
article
iii
power
but
exempt
from
the
good
behavior
tenure.
it
does
not
have
controlling
bearing
on
this
case.
now
what
then
is
left?
what
is
left
of
course,
is
the
plenary
legislative
power
of
congress
over
the
district
of
columbia
and
in
the
course
of
discussing
the
territorial
court
cases,
i
have
already
outlined
of
course
our
position
on
that.
the
district
of
columbia
is
permanent,
this
court
has
already
held
that
each
time
a
constitutional
right
was
claimed
to
be
denied
because
to
a
litigant
because
the
district
of
columbia
was
somehow
unique.
this
court
has
rejected
that
argument.
mr.
frank
f.
flegal
no,
not
that
i
know
off
your
honor.
my
point
is
that
the
citizens
of
the
district
of
columbia
before
the
federal
courts
have
all
of
the
rights
of
the
original
constitution
and
the
amendments,
whether
or
not
the
territorial
litigants
were
deprived
of
the
right
we
seek
here
by
virtue
of
a
fourth
amendment
theory
or
an
article
iii
temporary
status
theory.
but
we
don't
think
its
determinative.
mr.
frank
f.
flegal
yes
sir,
indeed
so
because
of
course
that
is
essential
to
our
proposition.
the
government
has
not
argued
otherwise
but
let
me
just
briefly
address
that
right
now
your
honor.
the
earliest
case
--
mr.
frank
f.
flegal
article
iii
power,
of
course,
because
if
our
case
did
not
arise
under
article
iii
we
haven't
got
any
way
to
bring
direct
--
mr.
frank
f.
flegal
that's
correct
the
only
power
that
we
seek
to
invoke
here
is
the
law
of
the
united
states.
so
there
was
nothing
to
do
with
any
other
of
the
matters
to
which
the
judicial
power
extends.
it
has
been
repeatedly
held,
both
in
the
decisions
of
this
court
and
in
decisions
of
the
early
district
of
columbia
courts,
going
back
as
early
as
1805
an
opinion
which
chief
justice
marshall
participated
while
sitting
on
circuit
that
laws
applicable
exclusively
to
the
district
of
columbia
are
laws
of
the
united
states.
indeed
they
must
be
so
or
this
court
could
not
review
a
local
matter
as
it
has
historically
done
that
was
not
otherwise
presented
with
a
constitutional
issue.
as
recently
for
example,
as
1965
i
believe
it
was
this
court
decided
purely
on
a
basis
of
statutory
construction
a
tax
matter
arising
out
of
the
district
of
columbia
taxing
statutes.
of
course
the
only
power
this
court
would
have
to
construe
that
statute
and
it
was
not
a
constitutional
claim,
it
was
a
statutory
claim
would
be
if
that'
statute
was
a
law
of
the
united
states.
the
first
chief
judge
of
the
local
courts
in
the
district
of
columbia,
chief
judge
crench
(ph)
who
also
--
mr.
frank
f.
flegal
why
do
i
say
that
this
court
could
not
because
no
other
power
in
article
iii
would
purport
to
give
this
court
the
power
to
construe
a
statute
that
was
not
a
statute
of
the
united
states,
a
law
of
the
united
states
or
--
mr.
frank
f.
flegal
well
in
diversity
cases
of
course,
then
you
have
a
power,
if
the
case
arises
that
diversity
of
citizenship,
the
status
of
the
parties
confers
jurisdiction
to
deal
with
the
case
in
controversy
and
issue
between
them
regardless
of
the
nature
of
the
suit
but
the
district
of
columbia
against
general
motors
which
is
the
case
i
referred
to
was
not
a
diversity
suit.
it
came
to
this
court
with
no
other
basis
for
article
iii
jurisdiction
except
the
construction
of
the
statute.
we
have
collected
in
our
brief,
similar
cases
which
go
back
through
the
19th
century
and
we
have
cited
in
our
brief
from
the
very
first
territorial
court
case
incidentally.
american
insurance
company
v.
canter
the
statement
of
mr.
justice
johnson
who
sat
on
circuit
on
that
case
that
if
law
is
applicable
to
exclusively
to
the
district
of
columbia
are
not
laws
of
the
united
states,
this
court,
the
supreme
court
has
no
power
to
review
them.
and
in
the
course
of
that
argument
he
rejected
that
proposition
and
said,
laws
applicable
exclusively
to
the
district
of
columbia
are
laws
of
the
united
states.
the
question
then
finally
arises
is
there
something
in
the
plenary
legislative
power
given
congress
under
section
17
rather
clause
17
of
the
article
i,
section
8,
the
so
called
plenary
power
over
the
district
of
columbia
that
somehow
relates
to
the
constitutional
right
at
stake
here.
we
say
not,
we
say
not
for
two
reasons.
first,
that
plenary
power
is
not
limited
to
the
district
of
columbia.
that's
the
power
that
provides
not
only
for
exclusive
legislation
over
the
seat
of
government
but
also
of
course
federal
enclaves
and
forts
out
in
several
states
so
that
this
argument
is
not
strictly
limited
to
the
district
of
columbia.
beyond
that
this
court
has
always
held
and
i
think
correctly
that
when
you
are
dealing
with
the
exclusive
and
the
plenary
legislative
power
of
congress
that
may
mean
congress
is
free
of
any
other
restriction
in
article
i
but
it
does
not
exempts
congress
from
other
provision
in
the
body
or
the
bill
of
rights
of
the
constitution.
mr.
frank
f.
flegal
indeed
they
do
sir.
and
the
pains
that
they
went
through
is
embodied
in
of
course
clause
17
of
section
8
of
article
i
and
that
is
the
plenary
legislative
and
i
underlined
that
word
legislative
power
given
congress
that
means
--
mr.
frank
f.
flegal
oh!
clearly,
if
a
state
--
mr.
frank
f.
flegal
now
that's
where
we
disagree.
our
proposition
is
the
district
of
columbia
of
course
is
not
a
state.
the
seat
of
government
was
a
state
at
one
time
and
it
was
maryland
in
virginia.
it
was
seated
to
an
exclusive
federal
jurisdiction
attached
in
1801
under
the
session
act.
at
that
point,
congress
is
not
strictly
speaking
a
state
legislature.
this
court
has
already
held
that
congress
is
barren
by
provisions
which
don't
bind
a
state
legislature
when
dealing
with
local
matters.
i
refer
again
to
the
fifth
amendment
grand
jury
indictment
and
the
article
iii
and
the
sixth
amendment
right
to
a
jury
trial.
a
state
legislature
is
not
bound
by
those
provisions.
congress
when
acting
and
legislating
locally
for
the
district
of
columbia
is
--
mr.
frank
f.
flegal
indeed
sir.
we
are
claiming
the
same
safeguard
that
this
court
referred
to
in
the
court
martial
case
is
starting
with
toth,
o'callahan,
lark,
o'donoghue,
this
is
the
right
of
the
federal
litigant,
this
is
the
right
we
claim.
indeed
we
think
the
colts
case
which
is
282
united
states
cited
in
our
brief
is
directly
on
point.
in
that
case,
in
our
local
case
arising
out
of
the
district
of
columbia,
this
courts
squarely
held
that
a
local
litigant
was
entitled
to
the
safeguards
of
section
2
of
article
3,
the
jury
trial.
there
is
no
reference
in
the
colts
case
to
the
sixth
amendment,
purely
section
2
article
3.
mr.
frank
f.
flegal
yes,
under
the
constitution,
your
honor,
the
appointment
of
officers
of
the
judges
can
also
be
vested
in
the
president
alone,
without
conformation
or
in
the
head
of
the
department.
mr.
frank
f.
flegal
yes.
mr.
frank
f.
flegal
the
reason
that
bids
me
to
say
that
your
honor
is
there
is
nothing
else
in
the
appointing
part
of
article
2
that
distinguishes
judges
from
those
inferior
officers.
in
other
words,
article
2
reads
that
unless
congress
shall
by
law
otherwise
provide
the
presidential
appoint
and
the
congress
shall
give
their
advice
in
consent
but
by
law
congress
may
vest
the
appointment
of
the
inferior
officers
in
the
present
law
and
order
in
ahead
of
a
department.
now
the
final,
of
course,
question
raised
by
this
case
is
whether
or
not,
we
were
entitled
to
have
our
notion
to
suppress
granted
by
a
constitutional
judge
or
by
a
non-constitutional
judge,
that
is
a
separate
issue
and
it's
an
issue
equally
dis-positive
of
this
case;
for
on
this
record
without
the
evidence
we
sought
to
have
suppress,
there
is
no
evidence
to
support
appellant's
conviction.
that
requires,
of
course,
written
briefly
in
the
facts.
they
are
not
in
dispute.
at
the
trial
court,
appellant
and
his
witness
gave
a
different
version
of
this
encounter
than
did
the
police
officers.
we
have
not
contained
it
on
appeal
and
we
do
not
contained
here
that
the
trial
judge
was
bound
to
believe
our
witness
rather
our
position
is
on
the
police
officers
version
of
the
events.
appellants
right
to
be
free
from
unreasonable
seizures
was
violated.
what
were
the
facts?
appellant
was
driving
a
car
by
8'0
clock
in
the
evening
on
the
600
block
of
t-street
in
downtown
washington.
at
that
point
in
time,
he
had
violated
no
law,
no
traffic
ordinance,
he
had
no
apparent
equipment
defect
and
there
is
no
contention,
there
has
been
no
contention
in
any
court
below
and
there
is
no
contention
here,
that
the
officers
were
possessed
of
any
articulable
facts
to
show
that
he
had
been,
was
or
was
about
to
be
engaged
in
any
criminal
conduct.
this
was
a
matter
of
a
specific
finding
by
the
court
of
appeals.
two
plain
clothes
officers
assign
to
the
special
operations
division
of
the
district
of
columbia
police
department
decided
that
they
would
stop
appellant
for
what
has
been
described
in
this
record
as
a
spot-check
or
a
traffic-check
or
in
one
place,
a
rental
agreement
check.
they
turned
on
their
red
lights
and
their
siren
and
they
force
the
appellant
to
the
side
of
the
road.
appellant
produce
the
driver's
license
and
was
asked
to
return
to
the
car
and
obtain
a
copy
of
his
rental
agreement
form
and
i
interject
the
officers
of
plain,
that
they
knew
this
was
a
rental
agreement
car
rather
a
rental
car
because
of
the
special
serial
numbers
on
the
license
plate.
an
officer
was
thereupon
engaged
in
discussing
with
appellant,
an
appellant
discrepancy
in
the
exploration
date
of
his
rental
agreement.
when
a
fellow
officer
who
had
been
on
the
passenger
side
of
the
car
shining
a
flashlight
into
the
interior
discovered
the
gun,
sees
the
gun
and
arrested
appellant.
our
contention
is
at
the
moment
appellant
was
stopped,
at
the
moment
he
was
stopped
for
this
license
at
spot-check,
his
fourth
amendment
rights
against
unreasonable
seizures
had
been
infringed.
it
is
important
to
point
out
that
in
this
case
there
is
no
congressional
statute
which
on
its
face,
purports
to
authorize
police
officers
to
stop
citizens
for
purpose
of
inspecting
either
driver's
licenses
or
motor
vehicle
registrations.
the
statutes
do
require
that
citizens
carry
both
of
those
documents
while
they
operate
a
car.
and
the
driver's
license
statute
does
require
that
a
citizen
display
that
license
to
a
police
officer
but
it
does
not
specifically
provide
that
the
officer
is
entitle
to
stop
in
order
to
ask
for
the
display.
mr.
frank
f.
flegal
our
position
is
that
a
police
officer
acting
without
standards
set
out
by
somebody
either
the
legislature
perhaps
the
commissioners
or
the
district
of
columbia
or
at
least
the
higher
officials
in
the
police
department.
he
cannot
be
left
to
his
own
discretion
to
pick
anybody
else
that
he
wants
out
for
a
spot-check
and
i
say
that
for
this
reason.
on
this
record,
the
officer
who
made
this
spot-check
said
that
i
have
no
basis,
i
have
been
given
no
instructions
as
to
how
or
whom
i
should
stop.
i
think
it's
up
to
me
to
pick
people
out
and
i
pick
rental
cars
because
i
think
a
lot
of
them
are
overdue.
i
want
to
see
if
the
man
can
prove
that
it's
not
overdue
because
it's
a
crime
if
it
is
overdue.
he
also
referred
to
the
fact
that
on
another
occasion
a
fellow
officer
had
found
$6,000
with
of
narcotics
in
a
rental
car.
leaving
it
to
the
unfettered
and
unarticulated
standards
of
the
police
officer
on
the
corner,
simply
poses
too
great
and
too
unreasonable,
a
restriction
with
a
right
of
free
movement.
we
don't
see
in
contemporary
urban
society
any
great
difference
between
walking
down
the
street
and
driving.
mr.
frank
f.
flegal
oh,
clearly,
clearly,
but
i
am
talking
in
terms
of
justifiable
expectation
of
privacy.
you
may
will
have
to
submit
to
reasonable
and
perhaps
spot-checks
but
the
question
is
not
is
at
spot-check,
that's
what
we
think
the
court
below
made
the
mistake.
the
question
is,
is
this
a
reasonable
spot-check
and
we
say
when
it
is
done
on
an
individual
basis
by
a
police
officer
given
no
standards
by
anybody,
stopping
them
for
his
own
reasons,
that's
what
makes
it
unreasonable.
i
think
i
should
call
to
the
courts
attention,
the
case
which
was
decided
in
the
supreme
court
of
pennsylvania
and
we
were
unable
to
include
it
in
our
brief
so
that
we
will
shortly
do
so
in
a
formal
amendment.
you
know
we
only
get
the
opinion
yesterday,
the
supreme
court
of
pennsylvania,
the
case
is
commonwealth
against
swanger
has
since
squarely
so
held.
it
is
simply
unreasonable
for
police
officers
acting
on
their
own
to
stop
for
spot-checks
and
the
pennsylvania
case,
if
anything
there
was
a
much
more
compelling
state
requirement
because
pennsylvania
had
a
statute,
the
case
is
based
squarely
on
the
fourth
amendment,
squarely
on
the
principles
in
(inaudible).
mr.
frank
f.
flegal
i
think
that
gets
to
be
a
closer
case
to
reasonable,
your
honor,
because
now
you
have
had
a
responsible
determination
by
the
police
chief
or
the
traffic
chief
whoever
he
is,
you
have
given
a
police
officer
on
the
corner
a
basis
to
do
it.
so
he
is
not
doing
it
because
he
thinks
rental
cars
are
overdue,
because
there
might
be
narcotics
and
you
have
told
them
how
to
do
it.
mr.
frank
f.
flegal
not
random
--
where
the
basis
for
the
random
selection
is
left
to
the
individual
judgment
of
the
officer
that's
the
narrow
point
we
make
on
this
case.
we
have
nothing
to
argue
here
about
what
would
happen
if
the
police
chief
said
every
50th
car
or
today
is
yellow
cars,
or
something
of
that
nature,
that's
the
next
case
but
our
case
is
leaving
it
to
the
unfettered
judgment
of
the
officer
on
the
corner
and
we
think
and
we
think
this
record
shows,
that
is
simply
runs
too
high
of
a
risk.
mr.
frank
f.
flegal
for
driverâ€™s
licenses
or
somewhat?
mr.
frank
f.
flegal
yes,
alright
that
becomes
a
different
case,
again,
they
have
got
a
basis,
they
have
given
the
officer
some
standards
and
perhaps
you'd
have
a
different
case,
i
think
it's
important
here
to
have
one
other
factor
and
that
is
that
in
this
case,
the
only
safety
matter
really
is
the
driver's
license.
it
was
not
even
set
forth
as
the
officer
is
a
basis
for
the
stop,
that
document
was
produced
at
the
outset
of
the
stop,
returned
and
appellant
was
not
free
to
go
at
that
point
in
time.
in
other
words,
this
officer
on
this
record
is
using
his
power
to
make
traffic
checks
to
see
whether
or
not
you
can
prove
a
rental
car
is
overdue
and
of
course,
it's
the
officers
also
conceded
they
have
a
list
of
overdue
in
stolen
cars
and
this
car
was
not
on
that
list.
mr.
frank
f.
flegal
of
course,
our
proposition
in
this
case,
your
honor,
is
what
they
initially
did.
we
make
no
contention
that
if
they
had
a
right
to
stop
appellant
under
the
circumstances
shown
on
this
record
that
what
they
did
thereafter
made
it
unreasonable,
our
contention
is
they
could
not
under
the
circumstances
of
this
case
stop
him
at
the
outset.
mr.
frank
f.
flegal
i
am
sorry,
perhaps
i
didn't
understand
your
honor's
question.
mr.
frank
f.
flegal
abounding
a
traffic.
mr.
frank
f.
flegal
right.
mr.
frank
f.
flegal
not
doing
something
about,
your
honor,
the
fourth
amendment
doesn't
say
they
can't
do
anything
about
it.
it
says
that
if
you
infringe
the
defendant's
fourth
amendment
right
in
getting
to
the
position
and
stopping
the
car,
then
you
can
introduce
that
piece
of
evidence.
it
doesnâ€™t
mean
of
course
you
can
release
the
child.
mr.
frank
f.
flegal
my
position
would
be
the
same.
the
admission
of
the
gun
or
the
admission
of
the
body
does
not
make
a
distinction.
for
this
reason
it
is
our
position
that
the
judgment
below
should
be
reversed
and
with
the
court
belief
i
will
save
my
remaining
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
frank
f.
flegal
i
appreciate
that
your
honor.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
one
central
point
that
is
now
involved
in
the
case
is
the
positions
of
the
parties
have
crystallized,
is
whether
or
not
the
citizens
of
the
district
of
columbia
stand
on
a
different
footing
insofar
as
article
3
safeguards
and
protections
are
concerned
from
citizens
in
the
several
states.
we
think
the
answer
to
that
dis-positive
question
is
no.
we
rely
first
upon
the
fact
that
the
constitution
required
the
district
of
columbia
to
be
carved
out
of
the
several
states.
mr.
frank
f.
flegal
oh,
clearly
your
honor.
the
legislature
which
enacts
the
laws
for
the
citizens
of
the
district
of
columbia
and
of
course
those
who
come
into
the
district
of
columbia
is
congress
or
whatever
local
legislature
it
is.
mr.
frank
f.
flegal
that
is
a
legislative
difference
and
we
suggest
it
has
no
extension
to
article
3
safeguards
and
protections.
as
i
was
indicating
the
district
of
columbia
had
to
be
carved
out
of
the
several
states.
that
was
a
factor
which
this
court
found
dis-positive
in
the
o'donoghue
opinion
upon
which
we
place
heavy
reliance
and
i
would
respectfully
disagree
with
the
solicitor
general
that
i
think
if
the
appellant
does
not
prevail
in
this
case
at
least
some
of
the
language,
some
of
the
article
iii
theory
of
the
rights
and
the
benefits
set
forth
in
the
o'donoghue
opinion
would
have
to
be
rejected
or
retreated
from.
now
--
mr.
frank
f.
flegal
precisely,
your
honor.
mr.
frank
f.
flegal
and
the
difference
is
the
difference
between
the
fourteenth
amendment
which
is
the
state's
federal
constitution
restriction
on
a
state
legislature
and
the
bill
of
rights
and
original
constitution
on
congress.
mr.
frank
f.
flegal
yes
indeed
so
sir,
indeed
so
and
i
say
that
because
this
court
has
so
held.
many
rights
which
citizens
of
a
state
and
which
are
not,
which
don't
fetter
a
state
legislature's
judgment,
the
seventh
amendment
right
to
a
trial
by
jury
in
a
civil
case,
the
sixth
amendment
and
article
iii
right
to
a
jury
trial
in
the
criminal
case
and
the
fifth
amendment
grand
jury
right
are
applicable
to
local
offenses
in
the
district
of
columbia.
to
that
extent
we
submit
--
mr.
frank
f.
flegal
and
in
the
territories,
your
honor,
depending
upon
whether
or
not
the
territory
is
been
incorporated
or
not
and
whether
it's
being
fundamental
or
not,
those
are
--
mr.
frank
f.
flegal
itâ€™s
been
assumed
your
honor,
i
know
of
no
case
in
this
court
which
is
ever
squarely
so
held
--
mr.
frank
f.
flegal
it
would
make
no
difference
to
me,
your
honor.
we
would
the
submit
the
citizens
before
the
federal
court
in
the
district
of
columbia
charged
with
a
felony
is
entitled
to
precisely
the
same.
constitutional
rights
and
safeguards
as
a
citizen
charged
for
a
federal
felony
before
a
federal
tribunal
in
one
of
several
states
and
we
think
the
framers
did
accomplish
something
by
the
good
behavior
clause
of
the
constitution
something
benefited
to
the
litigants.
mr.
frank
f.
flegal
i
am
giving
the
residents
of
the
district
of
columbia
precisely
the
same
as
i
would
give
the
resident
of
maryland
and
that
is
the
right
--
mr.
frank
f.
flegal
correct.
mr.
frank
f.
flegal
weren't
tried
before
the
state
tribunals,
and
they
get
a
precisely
the
same
--
mr.
frank
f.
flegal
several
other
states,
but
that
is
a
question
on
which
we
--
a
fact
on
which
we
place
no
reliance
for
our
proposition.
what
we
are
saying
is
the
citizen
in
the
district
of
columbia
gets
rights
which
the
state
of
court
would
not
have
to
afford
him
sitting
in
maryland,
the
grand
jury
indictment
the
jury
and
we
submit
the
good
behavior
judge.
mr.
frank
f.
flegal
that's
the
arguendo
assumption
your
honor,
if
the
governments
we
think
that
goes
too
far
and
if
there
are
serious
problems
if
congress
ever
passed
the
hypothetical
legislation
that
the
government
state
court
argument
rest
upon,
this
court
is
confronted
some
of
those
problems
in
the
seventh
amendment
context,
with
the
state
courts
trying
federal
civil
actions
and
in
some
cases
the
federal
employer
liability
acts
in
so
forth,
implied
as
part
of
the
remedy.
some
part
of
the
seventh
amendment
jury
protection,
but
that's
not
our
argument.
we
assume
arguendo
with
the
government
that
if
state
courts
could
constitutionally
try
federal
clients
fourteenth
amendment
protections
would
apply.
our
preposition
is
purely
a
limitation
on
exercise
of
the
federal
judicial
power.
if
court
has
no
further
questions,
we
submit
that
the
judgment
of
the
district
of
columbia
court
of
appeal
should
be
reversed
either
with
directions
to
remand
this
case
for
a
new
trial
before
a
constitutional
court,
or
in
the
alternative
to
reverse
and
remand
for
either
a
new
trial
or
a
judgment
of
acquittal,
excluding
the
evidence
which
we
challenge.
thank
your
honor.
