o'donoghue,

mr.
flegal,
you
say
totally
alien
to
article
3.
are
you
suggesting
that
the
good
behavior
or
language
of
article
3
could
be
implemented
only
by
the
process
of
impeachment?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
mr.
flegal
if
you
follow
justice
harlan’s
analysis
in
the
glidden
v.
zdanok,
the
litigants
in
these
territorial
courts
i
mean
presumably
the
sentence
is
imposed
on
them
are
rather
permanent,
rather
than
temporary.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
they
were
exempt
from
having
no
rights
enforced
in
those
cases?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
was
it
for
purposes
of
the
civil
rights
act?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
flegal,
under
your
theory,
could
congress
vest
the
appointment
of
judges
in
the
district
of
columbia
and
other
one,
anyone
other
than
the
president
of
the
united
states?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that
is
if
there
are
inferior
officers
under
that
section
of
the
constitution.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
what
leads
you
to
say
that
such
judges
could
be
treated
as
inferior
officers?
is
that
term
is
used
in
the
brief
too?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
say
that
a
police
officer
could
not
spot-check
for
driver's
licenses
in
the
districts?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
oh,
it's
that
that
you've
to
be
license
to
drive
down
the
street,
you
don't
have
to
be
licensed
to
walk
down?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
this
may
be
rather
subjective
inquiry
mr.
solicitor
general.
but
do
you
think
the
majority
of
the
o'donoghue
court
would
have
decided
this
case
the
way
the
district
of
columbia
court
of
appeals
did?
