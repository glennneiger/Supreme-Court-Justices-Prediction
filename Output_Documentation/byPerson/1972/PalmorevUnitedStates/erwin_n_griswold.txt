mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
may
it
pleases
the
court.
as
mr.
flegal
has
indicated,
there
are
three
separate
questions
in
this
case
and
i
shall
discuss
them
in
the
same
order
in
which
he
did.
the
first
is
the
question
of
this
court's
jurisdiction
of
the
appeal
which
was
taken
here.
that
i
think
divides
into
two
parts
and
i
would
make
it
somewhat
different
answer
to
mr.
stewart's
question
about
this
than
mr.
flegal
did,
because
i
think
one
of
those
parts
is
identical
with
the
constitutional
question
presented
with
respect
to
the
district
of
columbia
court
system.
for
if
it
should
be
concluded
as
i
hope
it
will
not,
that
criminal
cases
in
the
district
of
columbia
can
be
heard
only
by
article
3
courts,
then
these
tribunals
are
not
courts
for
they
do
not
meet
their
requirement
of
article
3
particularly
as
the
tenure.
the
judges
of
these
courts
are
appointed
for
15
year
term;
they
don't
serve
during
a
period
of
good
behavior.
this
court
has
only
appellate
jurisdiction
in
cases
such
as
these
and
if
the
tribunal
below
is
not
validly
established.
it's
not
a
court,
and
this
court
has
no
jurisdiction
to
review
its
decision.
the
remedy
in
such
a
case
would
appear
to
be
by
writ
of
habeas
corpus
in
the
district
court
of
united
states
for
the
district
of
columbia.
but
if
the
tribunal
below
is
a
court
then
we
have
left
the
question
which
is
discussed
in
the
briefs.
congress
has
power
to
regulate
the
appellate
jurisdiction
of
this
court
and
has
done
so
in
section
1257
of
title
28
of
the
united
states
code.
it
is
paragraph
2
which
provides
for
appeal
to
this
court
to
review
a
decision
“rendered
by
the
highest
court
of
the
state”.
where
there
is
“drawn
in
question
the
validity
of
a
statute
of
any
state
on
the
ground
of
it's
being
repugnant
to
the
constitution's
treaties
or
laws
of
the
united
states
and
the
decision
is
in
favor
of
its
validity”.
now
these
words
alone
would
of
course
not
be
sufficient
to
support
jurisdiction
here
for
we
have
neither
a
decision
of
the
highest
court
of
the
state,
nor
do
we
have
involved
the
validity
of
a
statute
of
any
state.
since
the
court
below
is
one
established
for
the
district
of
columbia
by
congress,
and
the
statute
whose
validity
is
question
was
not
enacted
by
a
state,
but
by
congress.
the
first
of
these
matters
is
taken
care
of
in
the
statute
itself
by
amendment
which
was
enacted
as
a
part
of
the
district
of
columbia
court
reorganization
act
of
1970
and
it
is
printed
on
page
4
of
our
brief
at
the
end
of
our
printing
of
section
1257.
it
added
a
paragraph
there
which
provides
that
for
the
purposes
of
this
section
the
term
highest
court
of
the
state
includes
the
district
of
columbia
court
of
appeals,
so
that
half
of
the
problem
is
resolved.
but
there
still
remains
the
question
whether
the
decision
below
involves
a
validity
of
a
statute
of
any
state.
can
those
words
be
construed
to
apply
to
a
statute
which
was
passed
by
both
houses
of
congress,
signed
by
the
president
and
was
never
considered
by
the
legislature
of
any
state
or
indeed
of
any
territory.
if
congress
meant
that,
it
could
have
said
so.
it
knew
how
to
do
that
in
this
very
act.
for
it
did
provide
in
section
172-c1
of
the
act
adding
section
1363
to
title
28
of
the
united
states
code
that
laws
applicable
exclusively
to
the
district
of
columbia
should
not
be
considered
“laws
of
the
united
states”
or
“acts
of
congress”.
for
the
purposes
of
that
provision,
congress
made
no
similar
provision
for
a
special
modification
of
the
plain
words,
plain
meaning
of
the
words
statute
of
any
state
in
section
1257-2.
reliance
is
placed
on
this
court's
decision
in
balzac
against
puerto
rico
decided
in
1922
in
an
opinion
by
chief
justice
taft,
but
that
decision
is
clearly
distinguishable.
in
the
first
place
there
was
a
considerable
history
to
the
statutory
provision
involved
there.
it
is
too
complicated
to
give
in
detail
here,
but
it
is
readily
apparent
from
reading
the
opinion,
the
interrelation
of
then
sections
237
and
246
of
the
judicial
code.
the
statute
with
respect
to
puerto
rico
was
linked
to
the
provision
with
respect
to
hawaii
and
congress
has
said
that
it
wanted
review
here
which
was
comparable
to
that
in
cases
coming
from
the
states.
on
that
basis
a
statute
passed
by
the
legislature
of
puerto
rico
was
held
to
be
a
statute
of
a
state
for
the
purpose
of
what
is
now
section
1257,
taken
in
the
light
of
other
statutory
provisions
than
enforce.
but
here
we
do
not
have
a
statute
passed
by
a
territorial
legislature
or
any
other
outside
body.
the
statute
here
was
passed
by
congress
itself
after
extensive
consideration
there.
congress
has
never
provided
for
an
appeal
from
decisions
sustaining
the
validity
of
its
own
statutes,
and
there
is
no
reason
for
forcing
a
construction
on
the
statute
here
to
reach
that
result.
if
that
were
done,
defendants
in
the
dc
courts
could
question
the
validity
of
every
provision
in
the
dc
criminal
code.
and
the
validity
of
statutory
provision
against
murder
or
burglary
for
example
and
then
when
their
contentions
were
denied
by
the
court
below,
they
would
have
a
right
of
appeal
to
this
court
if
the
validity
of
the
statute
was
sustained.
the
position
for
which
we
contend
seems
to
be
sustain
likewise
by
this
court's
recent
decision
in
fornaris
against
ridge
tool
company
in
400
us
at
--
it
begins
on
page
41
and
the
jurisdictional
question
is
decided
in
a
long
footnote
on
page
42.
there
are
something’s
about
that
footnote
which
are
not
crystal
clear
to
me,
but
among
other
things
the
court
did
not
cite
the
balzac
case
which
would
seem
to
had
some
relevance,
but
record
does
make
it
perfectly
plain
that
for
purposes
of
appeal
from
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
a
statute
of
puerto
rico
is
not
an
act
--
is
not
a
statute
of
the
united
states.
i
should
think
therefore
that
the
fornaris
case
together
with
the
language
of
the
statute
itself
should
lead
to
the
conclusion
that
this
court
has
no
jurisdiction
of
the
appeal.
if
there
is
a
court
below
which
can
be
reviewed
here,
and
i
think
there
is,
then
the
papers
should
be
considered
by
the
court
as
a
petition
for
certiorari.
and
i
will
turn
next
to
the
second
and
in
some
way
the
major
question
involves
here,
although
all
are
important.
the
question
is
the
constitutional
validity
of
the
district
of
columbia
and
court
reorganization
act.
in
approaching
this
question
as
other
questions,
the
constitution
should,
of
course,
not
be
thought
of
as
a
mathematical
equation
or
as
some
kind
of
computer
program.
as
it
has
been
said
in
largest
part,
the
constitution
is
not
a
charter
liberties
but
a
blueprint
for
a
federal
system
of
government.
and
the
district
of
colombia
is
in
someway
is
the
keystone
of
the
federal
system.
marvelous
says
it
was
the
work
of
the
founding
fathers
in
philadelphia
in
1787.
there
were
something
that
they
did
not
fully
foresee
or
spell
out
in
detail.
and
it
has
been
this
court's
task
to
work
these
problems
out.
this
particular
area
of
the
interplay
of
article
iii
and
article-i
has
a
sort
of
academic
flavor
to
it.
and
it
may
be
an
understatement
to
say
that
it
has
not
always
received
wholly
consistent
treatment
from
this
court.
decisions
have
been
made
by
divided
courts.
sometimes
without
a
majority
and
statements
can
be
found
in
the
opinions
to
support
almost
any
position.
i
have
myself
been
burned
once
in
this
area.
in
1929,
this
court
decide
ex
parte
bakelite
corporation
in
279u.s.,
a
unanimous
decision
with
the
opinion
written
by
mr.
justice
van
devanter
who
was
in
acknowledge
authority
on
constitutional
procedure.
and
i
would
have
to
differ
with
mr.
flegal
when
he
said
that
there
wasn’t
even
dictum
which
said
there
could
be
article-i
courts
in
the
district
of
colombia
because
that
opinion
discuss
the
question
in
extend
so
and
concluded
that
the
courts
of
the
district
colombia
where
article-i
courts.
now
it’s
true
that
the
issue
in
the
case
was
the
status
of
the
then
court
of
costumes
appeals
but
and
so
therefore
there
is
a
dictum
not
a
decision
but
it
was
clear
sort
of
considered
dictum.
these
court
where
there
known
as
the
supreme
court
of
the
district
of
colombia
and
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
colombia.
the
case
also
considered
the
court
of
claims
and
for
clear
and
cogent
regions
based
long
outstanding
president
the
court
found
all
of
these
tribunals
where
validly
established
under
article-i
of
the
constitution.
it
was
only
4
years
later
that
the
case
of
o'donoghue
and
of
williams
came
before
this
court.
i
was
then
a
junior
in
the
department
of
justice
and
was
one
of
those
who
wrote
the
brief
for
the
united
states
in
these
cases.
the
question
was
whether
the
judges
of
these
courts
were
protected
by
the
provision
in
article
iii
which
says
that
the
salaries
of
the
judges
can
not
be
reduced
during
their
terminals.
under
the
circumstances
we
did
not
brief
the
question
extensively
but
relied
on
the
comprehensive
treatment
in
the
bakelite
case.
as
things
worked
out,
this
court's
bakelite
decision
proved
to
be
a
slander
read
as
far
is
the
district
of
colombia
was
concerned.
for
judge
o'donoghue
who
was
held
to
be
entitled
to
his
salary.
judge
williams
was
not
so
fortunate
but
he
was
indicated
more
than
30
years
later
with
the
aid
of
an
intervening
act
of
congress
and
establishing
both
the
court
of
claims
and
the
court
of--
appeals
as
article
iii
courts.
the
sams
have
been
shifting
in
this
area
but
i
do
no
think
that
they
have
shifted
enough
or
that
they
should
be
shifted
enough
to
invalidate
the
district
of
colombia
court
reorganization
act.
the
approach
in
this
field
it
seems
to
me
it
should
be
that
suggested
by
mr.
justice
harlan,
in
an
opinion
he
wrote,
in
an
analogous
case.
the
case
was
read
in
culver
involving
the
validity
of
a
trial
by
court
martial
of
a
woman
who
had
murdered
her
air
force
husband
at
an
air
base
in
england.
his
words
which
i
do
not
cite
as
authority
but
only
for
their
indication
of
an
approach
to
this
case
we
are
directly
applicable
to
trials
overseas
as
applied
to
this
case
they
would
read.
in
other
words
what
ross
and
the
insular
case
is
hold
is
that
the
particular
local
setting.
the
practical
necessities
and
the
possible
alternatives
are
relevant
to
a
question
of
judgment
on
question
such
as
these.
and
he
continued.
i
think
we
have
above
thought
is
crucial
in
approaching
the
case
is
before
us.
decision
is
easy
if
one
adopts
the
constricting
view
that
these
constitutional
guarantees
as
a
totality
do
or
do
not
apply.
but
for
me
the
question
is
which
guarantees
of
the
constitution
should
apply
in
view
of
the
particular
circumstances,
the
practical
necessities
and
the
possible
alternatives
which
congress
had
before
it.
the
question
is
one
of
judgment
not
of
compulsion.
in
considering
this
question
of
judgment,
we
note
that
there
is
surely
no
constitutional
requirement.
they
are
all
federal
cases;
all
federal
criminal
prosecutions
must
be
heard
by
article
iii
courts.
the
constitution
establishes
no
inferior
federal
courts
at
all
but
leaves
that
entirely
to
congress.
in
australia,
for
example
there
are
no
federal
courts.
all
commonwealth
criminal
prosecutions
are
conducted
in
the
state
courts.
we
might
well
have
had
such
a
system
here.
expect
for
a
period
of
one
year,
congress
provided
no
federal
courts
with
federal
question
jurisdiction
until
1875.
even,
today
many
federal
question
cases
can
not
be
heard
in
article
iii
courts
if
they
do
not
meet
the
jurisdictional
amount
established
by
congress.
that
means
that
these
cases
must
be
heard
by
state
courts
almost
none
of
which
meet
the
article
iii
test
as
to
tenure
and
non-reduction
of
salary.
from
the
very
earliest
days
of
the
republic,
congress
provided
for
the
trial
of
many
criminal
cases
in
state
courts.
these
are
listed
and
cited
in
the
two
articles
by
trials-i
which
appear
on
page
29
of
our
brief
and
i
would
like
to
make
a
correction
here
near
the
bottom
of
page
29
as
cited
the
article
of
charles
warren
in
37
harvard
law
review,
it
says
page
49
and
then
on
the
next
line
54,
55.
when
i
came
to
look
at
page
54
and
55,
i
couldn’t
find
anything
about
this
and
the
correct
reference
should
be
70-71.
as
recently
as
testa
against
katt
decided
shortly
after
world
war
ii,
the
court
held
the
states
must
entertain
suites

rising
under
a
federal
statue
of
the
price
control
act.
as
long
ago
as
1828,
chief
justice
marshall
recognized
the
necessity
of
legislative
courts
in
american
insurance
company
against
canter.
that
case
involves
the
validity
of
a
judgment
rendered
by
a
territorial
court
in
florida.
the
judges
of
which
they
are
referred
to
in
the
opinion
as
a
notary
in
five
jurors
but
apparently
the
notary
was
appointed
for
4
years.
the
great
chief
justice
held
that
the
judgment
was
valid,
saying
that
the
florida
court
could
not
receive
article
iii
judicial
power.
but
that
it
was
legislative
court
validly
established
by
congress
under
its
power
in
article-i
and
then
article
iv
section
iii
to
make
laws
for
the
property
and
territory
of
the
united
states.
it
was
a
necessary
basis
for
this
decision
that
the
requirements
of
the
article
iii
are
not
applicable
to
such
courts.
and
the
intervening
years
there
have
been
many
examples
of
such
courts.
when
the
territory
of
orleans
was
established
in
1804,
its
judges
were
given
4
years
terms.
and
this
was
generally
the
case
during
the
whole
process
of
developing
the
western
territories
of
the
united
states.
this
it
true
today
of
the
common
wealth
courts
in
porto
rico
and
of
the
local
courts
in
guam
and
the
virgin
islands.
in
american
samoa
and
trust
territory
of
the
pacific
there
are
today
judges
for
whom
the
statue
simply
says
that
they
are
designated
by
the
president
and
he
can
and
he
recently
has
simply
changed
the
designation
and
put
in
an
another
person
as
the
judge
in
american
samoa.
this
court
has
many
times
entertained
appeals
from
these
outlined
courts
without
any
question
as
to
their
valid
establishment.

got
to
this
court,
there
are
many
which
have
come
to
the
fifth
circuit
court
of
appeals,
and
there
are
a
good
many
where
petition
for
certiorari
have
been
filed
and
denied
without
not
on
jurisdictional
ground,
but
i
couldn't
find
one
which
had
been
entertained
on
the
merits
from
the
canal
zone.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
all
i
can
tell
you
is
that
is
not
life
tenure.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
whether
it's
four
years
or
ten
years.
we
will
now
decide
the
territorial
courts;
there
were
for
many
years
councilor
courts,
held
to
be
validly
established
in
re
ross
in
the
140
u.s.
now
very
likely
the
ross
case
would
not
be
followed
now,
because
there
weren't
really
judges
there,
just
councilor
officers
and
they
acted
as
prosecutor,
judge,
and
jury,
at
least
foreman.
the
objection
during
re
ross
is
essentially
one
of
due
process
though
and
not
of
article
iii
and
this
was
taken
care
of
the
1906,
when
there
was
established,
the
united
states
court
for
china,
with
power
to
review
councilor
decisions
and
to
handle
all
of
these
cases
for
all
of
china.
the
judge
of
this
court
and
i
can
tell
you
this,
mr.
justice,
the
judge
of
this
court
was
appointed
for
10
years,
and
he
could
be
removed
by
the
president
for
cause,
the
statute
said.
for
many
years,
the
judge
was
a
man
named
lubinger
(ph)
and
i
used
to
see
him
from
time
to
time
in
washington.
apparently,
he
wasn't
too
busy
in
china,
he
did
a
good
deal
of
legal
writing
including
some
about
the
united
states
court
for
china.
i
have
not
been
able
to
find
in
any
case
from
that
court
came
to
this
court
for
review,
but
there
is
at
least
one
reported
review
of
a
criminal
case
in
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit,
and
this
is
biddle
against
the
united
states
in
156
federal
not
f
2nd,
156
federal.
it
was
a
prosecution
for
taking
money
by
false
pretences.
the
defendant
was
convicted
and
sentenced
to
a
year
in
the
jail
in
shanghai,
and
on
appeal,
this
was
reversed
not
because
of
any
defect
in
the
court,
but
because
the
apparent
court
concluded
that
the
facts
alleged
in
the
charge
did
not
constitute
false
pretences.
now
these
instances
are
enough
to
show
that
federal
questions
including
criminal
charges
need
not
be
inevitably
heard
only
by
courts
which
are
established
with
article
iii
guarantees.
state
courts
do
not
meet
that
test.
there
were
united
states
criminal
prosecutions
in
state
courts
in
the
very
early
days
of
the
republic.
territorial
courts
do
not
meet
that
test;
councilor
courts
don't
meet
the
test.
i
might
even
add
that
regularly
established
united
states
courts
do
not
meet
that
test.
when
a
judge
sits
under
a
recess
appointment
then
i
am
unaware
of
any
decision,
which
says
that
a
judgment
rendered
in
such
cases
invalid
because
the
article
iii
guarantees
have
not
been
met.
now
it
can
be
said
well
there
is
a
special
constitutional
provision
about
recess
appointment,
but
so
as
there
are
special
constitutional
provision
with
respect
to
the
territories
of
the
united
states
and
with
respect
to
the
district
of
columbia.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no,
not
at
all.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
because
we
have
today
the
united
states
district
court
and
the
united
states
court
of
appeals,
in
the
district
of
columbia
circuit,
which
not
only
are
undoubtedly,
but
as
i
will
show
a
little
later
are
by
expressed
statement
of
congress
article
iii
courts.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
these
judges
here
of
the
superior
court
are
of
a
different
court
and
of
a
different
quality
of
judges
than
those
involved
in
o'donoghue.
the
o'donoghue,
the
district
courts
of
the
united
states
for
the
district
of
columbia,
the
judges
performed
essentially
the
same
function
that
the
district
court
judges
do
throughout
the
country.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
feel
fairly
sure
that
mr.
justice
although
it's
a
long
time
ago,
and
it's
a
hard
feel
to
be
sure
of
anything
that
at
the
time
of
o'donoghue
was
decided,
there
was
either
the
municipal
court
at
the
district
of
columbia
or
the
court
of
general
sessions.
i
don't
know
when
the
transition
was
made
that,
which
had
extensive
jurisdiction
including
criminal
jurisdiction.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
think
limited
to
imprisonment
for
one
year,
but
imprisonment
for
one
year
is
a
number
of
this
court's
decision
has
hold
is
taken
quite
seriously
and
there
was
no
intimation
that
those
courts
were
article
iii
courts
were
anything
but
article
i
courts.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no
mr.
justice,
i
do
not
think
so
at
all.
i
don't
think
that
o'donoghue
was
feeling
a
with
inferior
courts
in
the
united
states
and
nor
with
courts
which
were
given
solely
local
jurisdiction.
now,
it
is
said
by
mr.
frankel
that
this
case
is
different
from
all
the
ones
i
mentioned.
it
involves
a
district
within
the
confines
of
the
united
states,
now
embracing
an
area
which
was
once
within
the
state
of
maryland
and
subject
to
all
the
constitutional
guarantees.
of
course
there
was
no
guarantee
in
maryland
that
the
judges
of
the
state
courts
having
jurisdiction
over
the
general
run
of
crimes,
would
have
guarantees
like
those
provided
by
article
iii,
and
except
for
four
states
today,
are
state
judges
who
handle
all
the
ordinary
criminal
and
civil
business
in
the
country
do
not
have
such
guarantees,
but
the
district
is
in
the
united
states,
not
outside
of
it,
and
therefore
it
is
said
the
article
iii
guarantees
must
apply.
i
find
it
hard
to
say,
why
there
is
any
basis
for
a
therefore
there,
because
it's
preferably
plain
if
the
constitution
is,
is
and
always
has
been
applicable
to
the
incorporated
territories.
so
decided
by
this
court,
and
that
any
provisions
of
the
constitution
are
applicable
to
the
unincorporated
territories
as
was
involved
in
weems
against
the
united
states.
the
insurer
in
the
american
insurance
case
was
an
american
corporation
and
it
lost
its
(inaudible)
and
reynolds
was
an
american
citizen
and
he
was
convicted
of
bigamy
by
a
court
which
did
not
have
article
iii
guarantees
and
that
conviction
was
affirmed
by
this
court.
with
respect
to
the
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes,
mr.
chief
justice.
with
respect
to
the
district
of
columbia,
it
was
for
many
years
thought
and
generally
understood,
and
i
say
that
without
any
hesitation,
it
was
for
many
years
thought
and
generally
understood,
i
think
right
down
to
the
day
o'donoghue
case
was
decided,
that
all
of
the
courts
here
were
established
under
article
i.
it
was
on
that
basis
that
they
were
given
various
administrative
powers.
it
was
felt
going
back
to
the
very
earliest
decisions
of
this
court
that
article
iii
courts
could
not
be
assigned
non-judicial
functions
and
it
was
on
that
basis
that
it
was
felt
that
all
of
the
district
of
columbia
court
must
be
article
i
courts
because
they
pointed
members
with
the
school
board
may
have
reviewed
decisions
of
the
patent
office
which
did
not
result
in
final
judgments
and
they
did
various
things
which
was
then
understood
that
article
iii
judges
could
not
do.
certainly,
this
court
understood
that
they
were
all
article
i
courts
when
it
decided
the
bakelite
case
in
1929.
now
the
bakelite
case
is
perhaps
somewhat
under
plate
here,
it's
fairly
far
back
in
the
stream
of
history
on
this
thing,
but
the
bakelite
case
represented
an
understanding
which
i
think
was
general
over
a
period
of
50
or
75
years.
it
was
only
under
the
pressure
of
a
salary
reduction
question
which
conceivably
might
have
affected
the
result
that
this
court
saw
a
new
light
in
1933,
and
that
light
was
not
bright
enough
then
to
illuminate
the
court
of
claims.
moreover,
from
the
beginning
there
have
always
been
article
i
courts
and
judges
in
the
district.
justices
of
the
peace,
police
court,
municipal
court
and
more
recently
the
court
of
general
session,
courts
with
limited
jurisdiction
to
be
sure,
but
surely
exercising
judicial
power
including
substantial
jurisdiction
in
criminal
cases
and
if
the
judicial
power
of
the
united
states
can
only
be
given
to
article
iii
courts,
those
courts
and
all
the
acts
under
them
were
surely
invalid.
it
is
said
that
the
district
is
different
from
the
territories
because
they
were
transitory
while,
the
district
is
permanent.
it's
not
clear
why
this
makes
a
difference
under
article
iii,
article
iii
doesn't
say
anything
about
transitory
or
permanent.
but
as
to
the
transitory
nature
of
the
territories,
we
have
had
puerto
rico
and
guam
and
american
samoa
now
for
75
years
and
the
virgin
islands
now
for
more
than
55
years.
it
is
said
that
they
are
distant,
but
it
takes
only
a
couple
of
hours
to
get
from
here
to
washington
--
get
from
washington
to
puerto
rico
and
the
virgin
islands
and
there
is
instant
communication
with
all
of
these
places.
the
people
there
are
citizens
of
united
states,
no
less
and
no
mores
then
those
of
the
district
of
columbia.
moreover,
the
government
of
the
district
is
not
changeless.
there
is
a
great
deal
of
current
talk
about
home
rule
and
changes
in
congress
may
mean
that
this
is
more
likely
than
it
once
was.
there
is
also
a
talk
about
statehood.
there
would
be
a
considerable
problem
in
achieving
changes
such
as
these,
if
it
should
be
concluded
that
they
should
be
brought
above,
if
more
than
50
judges
on
the
two
court's
below
in
this
case
had
to
be
provided
for
life
and
it
should
not
be
overlooked
that
this
statute
was
enacted
by
the
congress
as
a
result
of
a
clear
crises
in
the
district
court
of
united
states
for
the
district
of
columbia
which
was
simply
overwhelmed
by
the
volume
of
its
criminal
business.
practically
all
of
the
judges
were
sitting
on
criminal
cases
all
of
the
time
and
the
ordinary
work
of
the
district
courts
could
not
be
carried
forward
and
the
congress
provided
this
means
greatly
to
expand
the
number
of
judges
in
the
district
of
columbia
assigned
to
deal
with
local
crimes
and
civil
matters
of
the
same
sort
that
are
dealt
with
by
state
courts
in
the
states.
it
would
be
a
bit
bizarre
if
the
district
of
columbia
became
a
state
to
say
that
the
50
judges
of
these
two
courts
below
must
be
given
life
tenure
if
the
state
court
judges
established
by
the
state
under
statehood
trying
the
same
kind
of
cases
would
not
have
to
have
article
iii
guarantees.
the
congress
expressly
grants
the
constitution,
expressly
grants
to
congress
in
article
i,
clause
17,
power
to
exercise
exclusive
jurisdiction
in
all
cases
whatsoever
and
really
what
could
be
more
comprehensive,
exclusive
jurisdiction
in
all
cases
whatsoever
over
the
district
that
is
accepted
as
a
seat
of
government
of
united
states.
this
court
has
said
that
this
is
a
plenary
part,
there
is
no
doubt
that
the
district
is
different
from
other
parts
of
the
country,
both
legally
and
practically,
until
recently
changed
by
constitutional
amendment
residence
of
the
district
did
not
have
that
most
elemental
right
in
the
democracy,
the
right
to
vote.
they
still
have
no
representation
in
the
senate
and
no
voting
representation
in
the
house,
though
these
bodies
pass
the
laws
that
govern
the
district
and
levy
the
taxes
that
are
applicable
here.
congress
has,
always
had
special
powers
here
and
has
always
exercised
them.
in
this
case,
it
moved
expressly
under
article
i.
the
very
first
section
of
the
district
of
columbia
court
reorganization
act,
section
11-101
and
this
unfortunately
is
not
printed
in
our
brief,
i
think
it
should
have
been
and
i
want
to
bring
it
particularly
to
the
court's
attention.
the
very
first
section
provides
as
follow:
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
section
11-101.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
of
the
dc
court,
that
would
be
of
the
court
reorganization
act
in
the
dc
court.
it
provides
that
the
courts
of
the
districts
of
columbia
are
as
follows,
established
under
article
iii.
1.
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states.
2.
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
circuit.
3.
the
district
court
of
the
united
states
and
then
continuing
quoting
the
statute.
established
under
article
i.
1.
the
district
of
columbia
court
of
appeals.
2.
the
superior
court
of
the
district
of
columbia.
thus
congress
made
it
explicit
that
it
knew
it
was
acting
under
article
i
that
it
intended
to
act
under
article
i
and
that
article
i
was
the
basis
for
the
authority
which
it
was
seeking
to
exercise
in
establishing
the
two
courts
below
in
this
case.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
before
resuming
the
main
threat
of
my
argument,
i
would
like
to
refer
to
a
memorandum
which
mr.
flegal
has
quite
property
filed
with
the
court,
calling
attention
to
a
new
edition
of
the
hart
and
wechsler's
casebook
about
federal
courts
in
particularly
to
a
paragraph
of
a
note
which
appears
on
page
397
of
that
note.
i
would
like
simply
to
suggest
to
the
court
that
they
read
the
entire
note
and
not
just
that
paragraph
on
page
397.
among
other
things
mr.
bator
who
is
the
author
of
this
part
says
in
paragraph
1,
notice
that
the
line
of
argument
made
above
does
not
in
itself
asserts
that
congress
has
unlimited
power
to
assign
federal
judicial
business
to
federal
legislative
courts.
it
simply
asserts
that
article
iii
does
not
rigidly
preclude
congress
from
exercising
some
flexibility
in
allocating
that
judicial
business
and
that
congress
may
make
a
particular
allocation
to
a
non-article
iii
tribunal,
if
functional
considerations
of
serving
a
valid
legislative
purpose
justified
and
if
there
is
adequate
provision
for
judicial
review
or
here
there
is
provision
for
judicial
review
in
all
cases
to
this
court
which
is
of
course
in
article
iii
court
and
then
i
would
like
to
say
that
nothing
in
our
position
requires
the
court
to
overrule
or
to
disapprove
anything
decided
in
the
o'donoghue
case.
the
courts
there
were
held
to
be
both
article
iii
and
article
i
courts
but
there
was
nothing
there
which
held
that
congress
could
not
create
courts
under
article
i
to
deal
with
local
matters
only.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
mr.
justice
if
i
may
put
it
this
way,
i
think
the
majority
of
the
court
that
decided
the
o'donoghue
case,
if
it
were
here
in
1973
would
decide
this
case
the
way
that
i
suggest.
in
1933
when
they
were
deciding
it
they
didn't
have
the
history
that
had
developed.
the
courts
established
the
declaration
of
congress
that
it
was
creating
these
courts
under
article
i.
if
all
of
those
provisions
had
been
before
the
court
in
1933
then
my
answer
would
be
yes,
that
they
would
have
accepted
the
–
let
me
--
i
mentioned
some
of
the
practical
problems
before
congress
and
legislating
here
the
difficulty
of
giving
life
tenure
to
50-60
judges
which
were
needed
but
there
is
also
another
practical
problem
and
that
is
fazing
in
the
judges
under
the
old
system
into
the
new.
the
judges
of
the
court
of
general
sessions
have
not
been
appointed
as
article
iii
judges
and
a
means
of
making
a
transition
was
to
establish
article
i
courts.
then
we
do
not
contend
that
congress
could
create
courts
generally
under
article
i
to
sit
all
over
the
country.
though
i
would
refer
to
the
united
states
tax
court
which
again
congress
has
validly
created
under
article
i
without
life
tenure
and
it
does
sit
all
over
the
country
but
it
has
no
criminal
jurisdiction.
congress
could
not
displace
the
article
iii
courts
in
the
states
by
establishing
article
i
courts
with
general
jurisdiction
or
by
a
series
of
article
i
courts
under
the
commerce
power
and
the
tax
power
and
other
powers.
our
position
this
simply
that
congress
has
broader
powers
over
governmental
organization
in
the
district
than
it
has
in
the
states.
now
let
return
to
the
final
subject
involved
in
the
case,
the
question
of
the
seizure.
this
is
one
of
considerable
importance
to
the
government
and
i
hope
that
i
have
not
left
it
buried
under
a
mass
of
technicalities
in
presenting
the
other
questions
involved.
the
basic
question
is
whether
a
policeman
may
make
a
selective
stop
of
a
motorist
for
the
purpose
of
checking
his
driver's
license
and
registration
certificates.
the
district
of
columbia
law
requires
an
operator
to
have
these
papers
in
his
possession
or
in
the
automobile
and
that
must
mean
something.
it's
not
just
ceremony
that
he
has
to
have
the
papers
in
his
position
there
to
be
there
so
that
they
can
be
shown
on
proper
occasion
unless
they
can
be
checked
by
a
police
officer.
there
is
no
way
to
tell
whether
motor
vehicles
which
are
surely
dangerous
instrumentalities
are
being
validly
operated.
here
the
check
was
no
whim.
the
police
officer
could
tell
from
the
license
plate
that
the
car
was
a
rental
car.
he
knew
that
many
rental
cars
were
held
over
time
which
is
unlawful
or
re-stolen.
in
this
case
the
whole
rental
agreement
did
indeed
indicate
that
the
car
was
overdue,
though
this
was
straightened
out
when
inquiry
was
made.
there
is
no
allegation
that
the
police
officer
acted
improperly,
that
is
in
a
violent
or
a
vicious
manner.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
directly?
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
they
could
be
since
1970
when
it
was
established
as
a
court.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
whether
it's
is
article
i
court
now
and
they
can
be
reviewed
here.
just
as
territorial
judgments
can
be
reviewed
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
the
court
has
always
held
that
it
is
an
exercise
to
judicial
power
and
there
is
appellate
jurisdiction
to
review
the
decisions
of
the
territorial
courts
established
under
article
i.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no.
only
if
it
is
exercising
a
judicial
power
but
regardless
of
whether
it's
under
article
iii
or
article
i.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
that
is
correct.
prior
to
1971
mr.
justice,
the
tax
court,
in
first
place
it
was
the
board
of
tax
appeal,
then
it
was
established
as
the
tax
court
but
because
of
a
curious
history,
the
statute
expressly
provided
that
it
is
an
independent
agency
and
the
executive
branch
for
the
government
and
that
lasted
till
1970.
and
during
that
time
it
was
quite
clear
that
this
court
could
not
review
a
decision
of
the
tax
court.
indeed
there
is
a
case
back
30
years
ago
involving
a
certificate
from
a
court
of
appeals
with
respect
to
a
question
from
the
tax
court
and
this
is
–
i
may
say
this
court
was
always
very
careful.
never
to
remand
their
decision
to
the
tax
court,
it
always
remanded
it
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
remand
to
the
tax
court.
but
here,
there
was
nothing
discriminatory
and
thus
stop
many
citizens
would
welcome
that
has
evidence
that
the
police
where
doing
their
duty.
incidentally,
the
statute
of
the
district
of
columbia
does
not
say
that
the
policeman
may
stop
the
car,
but
it
does
say
expressly
that
any
individual
to
whom
has
been
issued
a
permit
to
operate
a
motor
vehicle
shall
add
such
permit
in
his
immediate
possession
at
all
times,
when
operating
a
motor
vehicle
in
the
district
and
shall
exhibit
such
permit
to
any
police
officer
when
demand
is
made
therefore.
this
case
we
think
is
like
the
biswell
case,
where
people
realizes
to
deal
in
firearms
and
this
court
held
that
they
were
subject
to
inspect
it,
indeed
said
that
it
is
to
be
effective
in
service
a
credible
deterrent
unannounced
even
frequent
inspections
are
essential.
if
a
motor
is
chooses
to
drive
pursuant
to
a
license
for
which
he
has
applied,
he
does
so
with
a
knowledge
that
he
maybe
required
at
any
time
to
establish
that
he
is
doing
so
in
unconformity
with
the
law.
under
the
circumstances
such
checks
post
at
most
only
limited
threats
to
the
motorist
privacy,
and
no
threat
which
is
not
justified
by
his
acceptance
of
the
license
and
the
operation
under
it.
i
note
that
persons
who
wish
to
enter
this
court
room
they
have
to
submit
themselves
to
an
inspection
which
includes
the
opening
of
parcels,
and
the
opening
of
ladies
handbag,
i
would
not
suppose
there
was
any
question
about
that
and
i
see
no
basis
for
a
question
in
the
light
of
the
district
of
columbia
statute
with
respect
to
the
request
for
licenses
in
this
case.
if
the
stock
was
proper,
the
protective
action
of
officer
morris
had
and
looking
to
see
if
there
are
any
weapons
available
was
clearly
proper
under
the
general
rationale
of
terry
against
ohio
and
the
search
should
be
sustained.
if
the
court
reaches
the
merits
of
the
case,
the
judgment
of
the
district
of
columbia
court
of
appeals
should
be
affirmed.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
may
it
pleases
the
court.
as
mr.
flegal
has
indicated,
there
are
three
separate
questions
in
this
case
and
i
shall
discuss
them
in
the
same
order
in
which
he
did.
the
first
is
the
question
of
this
court's
jurisdiction
of
the
appeal
which
was
taken
here.
that
i
think
divides
into
two
parts
and
i
would
make
it
somewhat
different
answer
to
mr.
stewart's
question
about
this
than
mr.
flegal
did,
because
i
think
one
of
those
parts
is
identical
with
the
constitutional
question
presented
with
respect
to
the
district
of
columbia
court
system.
for
if
it
should
be
concluded
as
i
hope
it
will
not,
that
criminal
cases
in
the
district
of
columbia
can
be
heard
only
by
article
3
courts,
then
these
tribunals
are
not
courts
for
they
do
not
meet
their
requirement
of
article
3
particularly
as
the
tenure.
the
judges
of
these
courts
are
appointed
for
15
year
term;
they
don't
serve
during
a
period
of
good
behavior.
this
court
has
only
appellate
jurisdiction
in
cases
such
as
these
and
if
the
tribunal
below
is
not
validly
established.
it's
not
a
court,
and
this
court
has
no
jurisdiction
to
review
its
decision.
the
remedy
in
such
a
case
would
appear
to
be
by
writ
of
habeas
corpus
in
the
district
court
of
united
states
for
the
district
of
columbia.
but
if
the
tribunal
below
is
a
court
then
we
have
left
the
question
which
is
discussed
in
the
briefs.
congress
has
power
to
regulate
the
appellate
jurisdiction
of
this
court
and
has
done
so
in
section
1257
of
title
28
of
the
united
states
code.
it
is
paragraph
2
which
provides
for
appeal
to
this
court
to
review
a
decision
“rendered
by
the
highest
court
of
the
state”.
where
there
is
“drawn
in
question
the
validity
of
a
statute
of
any
state
on
the
ground
of
it's
being
repugnant
to
the
constitution's
treaties
or
laws
of
the
united
states
and
the
decision
is
in
favor
of
its
validity”.
now
these
words
alone
would
of
course
not
be
sufficient
to
support
jurisdiction
here
for
we
have
neither
a
decision
of
the
highest
court
of
the
state,
nor
do
we
have
involved
the
validity
of
a
statute
of
any
state.
since
the
court
below
is
one
established
for
the
district
of
columbia
by
congress,
and
the
statute
whose
validity
is
question
was
not
enacted
by
a
state,
but
by
congress.
the
first
of
these
matters
is
taken
care
of
in
the
statute
itself
by
amendment
which
was
enacted
as
a
part
of
the
district
of
columbia
court
reorganization
act
of
1970
and
it
is
printed
on
page
4
of
our
brief
at
the
end
of
our
printing
of
section
1257.
it
added
a
paragraph
there
which
provides
that
for
the
purposes
of
this
section
the
term
highest
court
of
the
state
includes
the
district
of
columbia
court
of
appeals,
so
that
half
of
the
problem
is
resolved.
but
there
still
remains
the
question
whether
the
decision
below
involves
a
validity
of
a
statute
of
any
state.
can
those
words
be
construed
to
apply
to
a
statute
which
was
passed
by
both
houses
of
congress,
signed
by
the
president
and
was
never
considered
by
the
legislature
of
any
state
or
indeed
of
any
territory.
if
congress
meant
that,
it
could
have
said
so.
it
knew
how
to
do
that
in
this
very
act.
for
it
did
provide
in
section
172-c1
of
the
act
adding
section
1363
to
title
28
of
the
united
states
code
that
laws
applicable
exclusively
to
the
district
of
columbia
should
not
be
considered
“laws
of
the
united
states”
or
“acts
of
congress”.
for
the
purposes
of
that
provision,
congress
made
no
similar
provision
for
a
special
modification
of
the
plain
words,
plain
meaning
of
the
words
statute
of
any
state
in
section
1257-2.
reliance
is
placed
on
this
court's
decision
in
balzac
against
puerto
rico
decided
in
1922
in
an
opinion
by
chief
justice
taft,
but
that
decision
is
clearly
distinguishable.
in
the
first
place
there
was
a
considerable
history
to
the
statutory
provision
involved
there.
it
is
too
complicated
to
give
in
detail
here,
but
it
is
readily
apparent
from
reading
the
opinion,
the
interrelation
of
then
sections
237
and
246
of
the
judicial
code.
the
statute
with
respect
to
puerto
rico
was
linked
to
the
provision
with
respect
to
hawaii
and
congress
has
said
that
it
wanted
review
here
which
was
comparable
to
that
in
cases
coming
from
the
states.
on
that
basis
a
statute
passed
by
the
legislature
of
puerto
rico
was
held
to
be
a
statute
of
a
state
for
the
purpose
of
what
is
now
section
1257,
taken
in
the
light
of
other
statutory
provisions
than
enforce.
but
here
we
do
not
have
a
statute
passed
by
a
territorial
legislature
or
any
other
outside
body.
the
statute
here
was
passed
by
congress
itself
after
extensive
consideration
there.
congress
has
never
provided
for
an
appeal
from
decisions
sustaining
the
validity
of
its
own
statutes,
and
there
is
no
reason
for
forcing
a
construction
on
the
statute
here
to
reach
that
result.
if
that
were
done,
defendants
in
the
dc
courts
could
question
the
validity
of
every
provision
in
the
dc
criminal
code.
and
the
validity
of
statutory
provision
against
murder
or
burglary
for
example
and
then
when
their
contentions
were
denied
by
the
court
below,
they
would
have
a
right
of
appeal
to
this
court
if
the
validity
of
the
statute
was
sustained.
the
position
for
which
we
contend
seems
to
be
sustain
likewise
by
this
court's
recent
decision
in
fornaris
against
ridge
tool
company
in
400
us
at
--
it
begins
on
page
41
and
the
jurisdictional
question
is
decided
in
a
long
footnote
on
page
42.
there
are
something’s
about
that
footnote
which
are
not
crystal
clear
to
me,
but
among
other
things
the
court
did
not
cite
the
balzac
case
which
would
seem
to
had
some
relevance,
but
record
does
make
it
perfectly
plain
that
for
purposes
of
appeal
from
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
a
statute
of
puerto
rico
is
not
an
act
--
is
not
a
statute
of
the
united
states.
i
should
think
therefore
that
the
fornaris
case
together
with
the
language
of
the
statute
itself
should
lead
to
the
conclusion
that
this
court
has
no
jurisdiction
of
the
appeal.
if
there
is
a
court
below
which
can
be
reviewed
here,
and
i
think
there
is,
then
the
papers
should
be
considered
by
the
court
as
a
petition
for
certiorari.
and
i
will
turn
next
to
the
second
and
in
some
way
the
major
question
involves
here,
although
all
are
important.
the
question
is
the
constitutional
validity
of
the
district
of
columbia
and
court
reorganization
act.
in
approaching
this
question
as
other
questions,
the
constitution
should,
of
course,
not
be
thought
of
as
a
mathematical
equation
or
as
some
kind
of
computer
program.
as
it
has
been
said
in
largest
part,
the
constitution
is
not
a
charter
liberties
but
a
blueprint
for
a
federal
system
of
government.
and
the
district
of
colombia
is
in
someway
is
the
keystone
of
the
federal
system.
marvelous
says
it
was
the
work
of
the
founding
fathers
in
philadelphia
in
1787.
there
were
something
that
they
did
not
fully
foresee
or
spell
out
in
detail.
and
it
has
been
this
court's
task
to
work
these
problems
out.
this
particular
area
of
the
interplay
of
article
iii
and
article-i
has
a
sort
of
academic
flavor
to
it.
and
it
may
be
an
understatement
to
say
that
it
has
not
always
received
wholly
consistent
treatment
from
this
court.
decisions
have
been
made
by
divided
courts.
sometimes
without
a
majority
and
statements
can
be
found
in
the
opinions
to
support
almost
any
position.
i
have
myself
been
burned
once
in
this
area.
in
1929,
this
court
decide
ex
parte
bakelite
corporation
in
279u.s.,
a
unanimous
decision
with
the
opinion
written
by
mr.
justice
van
devanter
who
was
in
acknowledge
authority
on
constitutional
procedure.
and
i
would
have
to
differ
with
mr.
flegal
when
he
said
that
there
wasn’t
even
dictum
which
said
there
could
be
article-i
courts
in
the
district
of
colombia
because
that
opinion
discuss
the
question
in
extend
so
and
concluded
that
the
courts
of
the
district
colombia
where
article-i
courts.
now
it’s
true
that
the
issue
in
the
case
was
the
status
of
the
then
court
of
costumes
appeals
but
and
so
therefore
there
is
a
dictum
not
a
decision
but
it
was
clear
sort
of
considered
dictum.
these
court
where
there
known
as
the
supreme
court
of
the
district
of
colombia
and
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
colombia.
the
case
also
considered
the
court
of
claims
and
for
clear
and
cogent
regions
based
long
outstanding
president
the
court
found
all
of
these
tribunals
where
validly
established
under
article-i
of
the
constitution.
it
was
only
4
years
later
that
the
case
of
o'donoghue
and
of
williams
came
before
this
court.
i
was
then
a
junior
in
the
department
of
justice
and
was
one
of
those
who
wrote
the
brief
for
the
united
states
in
these
cases.
the
question
was
whether
the
judges
of
these
courts
were
protected
by
the
provision
in
article
iii
which
says
that
the
salaries
of
the
judges
can
not
be
reduced
during
their
terminals.
under
the
circumstances
we
did
not
brief
the
question
extensively
but
relied
on
the
comprehensive
treatment
in
the
bakelite
case.
as
things
worked
out,
this
court's
bakelite
decision
proved
to
be
a
slander
read
as
far
is
the
district
of
colombia
was
concerned.
for
judge
o'donoghue
who
was
held
to
be
entitled
to
his
salary.
judge
williams
was
not
so
fortunate
but
he
was
indicated
more
than
30
years
later
with
the
aid
of
an
intervening
act
of
congress
and
establishing
both
the
court
of
claims
and
the
court
of--
appeals
as
article
iii
courts.
the
sams
have
been
shifting
in
this
area
but
i
do
no
think
that
they
have
shifted
enough
or
that
they
should
be
shifted
enough
to
invalidate
the
district
of
colombia
court
reorganization
act.
the
approach
in
this
field
it
seems
to
me
it
should
be
that
suggested
by
mr.
justice
harlan,
in
an
opinion
he
wrote,
in
an
analogous
case.
the
case
was
read
in
culver
involving
the
validity
of
a
trial
by
court
martial
of
a
woman
who
had
murdered
her
air
force
husband
at
an
air
base
in
england.
his
words
which
i
do
not
cite
as
authority
but
only
for
their
indication
of
an
approach
to
this
case
we
are
directly
applicable
to
trials
overseas
as
applied
to
this
case
they
would
read.
in
other
words
what
ross
and
the
insular
case
is
hold
is
that
the
particular
local
setting.
the
practical
necessities
and
the
possible
alternatives
are
relevant
to
a
question
of
judgment
on
question
such
as
these.
and
he
continued.
i
think
we
have
above
thought
is
crucial
in
approaching
the
case
is
before
us.
decision
is
easy
if
one
adopts
the
constricting
view
that
these
constitutional
guarantees
as
a
totality
do
or
do
not
apply.
but
for
me
the
question
is
which
guarantees
of
the
constitution
should
apply
in
view
of
the
particular
circumstances,
the
practical
necessities
and
the
possible
alternatives
which
congress
had
before
it.
the
question
is
one
of
judgment
not
of
compulsion.
in
considering
this
question
of
judgment,
we
note
that
there
is
surely
no
constitutional
requirement.
they
are
all
federal
cases;
all
federal
criminal
prosecutions
must
be
heard
by
article
iii
courts.
the
constitution
establishes
no
inferior
federal
courts
at
all
but
leaves
that
entirely
to
congress.
in
australia,
for
example
there
are
no
federal
courts.
all
commonwealth
criminal
prosecutions
are
conducted
in
the
state
courts.
we
might
well
have
had
such
a
system
here.
expect
for
a
period
of
one
year,
congress
provided
no
federal
courts
with
federal
question
jurisdiction
until
1875.
even,
today
many
federal
question
cases
can
not
be
heard
in
article
iii
courts
if
they
do
not
meet
the
jurisdictional
amount
established
by
congress.
that
means
that
these
cases
must
be
heard
by
state
courts
almost
none
of
which
meet
the
article
iii
test
as
to
tenure
and
non-reduction
of
salary.
from
the
very
earliest
days
of
the
republic,
congress
provided
for
the
trial
of
many
criminal
cases
in
state
courts.
these
are
listed
and
cited
in
the
two
articles
by
trials-i
which
appear
on
page
29
of
our
brief
and
i
would
like
to
make
a
correction
here
near
the
bottom
of
page
29
as
cited
the
article
of
charles
warren
in
37
harvard
law
review,
it
says
page
49
and
then
on
the
next
line
54,
55.
when
i
came
to
look
at
page
54
and
55,
i
couldn’t
find
anything
about
this
and
the
correct
reference
should
be
70-71.
as
recently
as
testa
against
katt
decided
shortly
after
world
war
ii,
the
court
held
the
states
must
entertain
suites
are
rising
under
a
federal
statue
of
the
price
control
act.
as
long
ago
as
1828,
chief
justice
marshall
recognized
the
necessity
of
legislative
courts
in
american
insurance
company
against
canter.
that
case
involves
the
validity
of
a
judgment
rendered
by
a
territorial
court
in
florida.
the
judges
of
which
they
are
referred
to
in
the
opinion
as
a
notary
in
five
jurors
but
apparently
the
notary
was
appointed
for
4
years.
the
great
chief
justice
held
that
the
judgment
was
valid,
saying
that
the
florida
court
could
not
receive
article
iii
judicial
power.
but
that
it
was
legislative
court
validly
established
by
congress
under
its
power
in
article-i
and
then
article
iv
section
iii
to
make
laws
for
the
property
and
territory
of
the
united
states.
it
was
a
necessary
basis
for
this
decision
that
the
requirements
of
the
article
iii
are
not
applicable
to
such
courts.
and
the
intervening
years
there
have
been
many
examples
of
such
courts.
when
the
territory
of
orleans
was
established
in
1804,
its
judges
were
given
4
years
terms.
and
this
was
generally
the
case
during
the
whole
process
of
developing
the
western
territories
of
the
united
states.
this
it
true
today
of
the
common
wealth
courts
in
porto
rico
and
of
the
local
courts
in
guam
and
the
virgin
islands.
in
american
samoa
and
trust
territory
of
the
pacific
there
are
today
judges
for
whom
the
statue
simply
says
that
they
are
designated
by
the
president
and
he
can
and
he
recently
has
simply
changed
the
designation
and
put
in
an
another
person
as
the
judge
in
american
samoa.
this
court
has
many
times
entertained
appeals
from
these
outlined
courts
without
any
question
as
to
their
valid
establishment.
reynolds
against
the
united

in

u.s.
was
on
error
to

court
of

of

and
the
cruel
and

case,

against

in

was
on
a

not
an
article

court.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes,
mr.
justice
but
the
case
was
here
on
review
of
a
judgment
of
the
court
of
claims.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
the
question
arose
in
the
canal
zone
but
it
was
a
--
if
we
were
thinking
the
same
case
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
it
was
a
suit
in
the
court
of
claims
to
recover
from
the
united
states
on
the
ground
that
the
united
states
had
seized
the
building
as
part
of
the
defensive
zone.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
have
looked
for
cases
from
the
canal
zone
that
got
to
this
court,
there
are
many
which
have
come
to
the
fifth
circuit
court
of
appeals,
and
there
are
a
good
many
where
petition
for
certiorari
have
been
filed
and
denied
without
not
on
jurisdictional
ground,
but
i
couldn't
find
one
which
had
been
entertained
on
the
merits
from
the
canal
zone.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
all
i
can
tell
you
is
that
is
not
life
tenure.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
whether
it's
four
years
or
ten
years.
we
will
now
decide
the
territorial
courts;
there
were
for
many
years
councilor
courts,
held
to
be
validly
established
in
re
ross
in
the
140
u.s.
now
very
likely
the
ross
case
would
not
be
followed
now,
because
there
weren't
really
judges
there,
just
councilor
officers
and
they
acted
as
prosecutor,
judge,
and
jury,
at
least
foreman.
the
objection
during
re
ross
is
essentially
one
of
due
process
though
and
not
of
article
iii
and
this
was
taken
care
of
the
1906,
when
there
was
established,
the
united
states
court
for
china,
with
power
to
review
councilor
decisions
and
to
handle
all
of
these
cases
for
all
of
china.
the
judge
of
this
court
and
i
can
tell
you
this,
mr.
justice,
the
judge
of
this
court
was
appointed
for
10
years,
and
he
could
be
removed
by
the
president
for
cause,
the
statute
said.
for
many
years,
the
judge
was
a
man
named
lubinger
(ph)
and
i
used
to
see
him
from
time
to
time
in
washington.
apparently,
he
wasn't
too
busy
in
china,
he
did
a
good
deal
of
legal
writing
including
some
about
the
united
states
court
for
china.
i
have
not
been
able
to
find
in
any
case
from
that
court
came
to
this
court
for
review,
but
there
is
at
least
one
reported
review
of
a
criminal
case
in
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit,
and
this
is
biddle
against
the
united
states
in
156
federal
not
f
2nd,
156
federal.
it
was
a
prosecution
for
taking
money
by
false
pretences.
the
defendant
was
convicted
and
sentenced
to
a
year
in
the
jail
in
shanghai,
and
on
appeal,
this
was
reversed
not
because
of
any
defect
in
the
court,
but
because
the
apparent
court
concluded
that
the
facts
alleged
in
the
charge
did
not
constitute
false
pretences.
now
these
instances
are
enough
to
show
that
federal
questions
including
criminal
charges
need
not
be
inevitably
heard
only
by
courts
which
are
established
with
article
iii
guarantees.
state
courts
do
not
meet
that
test.
there
were
united
states
criminal
prosecutions
in
state
courts
in
the
very
early
days
of
the
republic.
territorial
courts
do
not
meet
that
test;
councilor
courts
don't
meet
the
test.
i
might
even
add
that
regularly
established
united
states
courts
do
not
meet
that
test.
when
a
judge
sits
under
a
recess
appointment
then
i
am
unaware
of
any
decision,
which
says
that
a
judgment
rendered
in
such
cases
invalid
because
the
article
iii
guarantees
have
not
been
met.
now
it
can
be
said
well
there
is
a
special
constitutional
provision
about
recess
appointment,
but
so
as
there
are
special
constitutional
provision
with
respect
to
the
territories
of
the
united
states
and
with
respect
to
the
district
of
columbia.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no,
not
at
all.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
because
we
have
today
the
united
states
district
court
and
the
united
states
court
of
appeals,
in
the
district
of
columbia
circuit,
which
not
only
are
undoubtedly,
but
as
i
will
show
a
little
later
are
by
expressed
statement
of
congress
article
iii
courts.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
these
judges
here
of
the
superior
court
are
of
a
different
court
and
of
a
different
quality
of
judges
than
those
involved
in
o'donoghue.
the
o'donoghue,
the
district
courts
of
the
united
states
for
the
district
of
columbia,
the
judges
performed
essentially
the
same
function
that
the
district
court
judges
do
throughout
the
country.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
feel
fairly
sure
that
mr.
justice
although
it's
a
long
time
ago,
and
it's
a
hard
feel
to
be
sure
of
anything
that
at
the
time
of
o'donoghue
was
decided,
there
was
either
the
municipal
court
at
the
district
of
columbia
or
the
court
of
general
sessions.
i
don't
know
when
the
transition
was
made
that,
which
had
extensive
jurisdiction
including
criminal
jurisdiction.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
think
limited
to
imprisonment
for
one
year,
but
imprisonment
for
one
year
is
a
number
of
this
court's
decision
has
hold
is
taken
quite
seriously
and
there
was
no
intimation
that
those
courts
were
article
iii
courts
were
anything
but
article
i
courts.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no
mr.
justice,
i
do
not
think
so
at
all.
i
don't
think
that
o'donoghue
was
feeling
a
with
inferior
courts
in
the
united
states
and
nor
with
courts
which
were
given
solely
local
jurisdiction.
now,
it
is
said
by
mr.
frankel
that
this
case
is
different
from
all
the
ones
i
mentioned.
it
involves
a
district
within
the
confines
of
the
united
states,
now
embracing
an
area
which
was
once
within
the
state
of
maryland
and
subject
to
all
the
constitutional
guarantees.
of
course
there
was
no
guarantee
in
maryland
that
the
judges
of
the
state
courts
having
jurisdiction
over
the
general
run
of
crimes,
would
have
guarantees
like
those
provided
by
article
iii,
and
except
for
four
states
today,
are
state
judges
who
handle
all
the
ordinary
criminal
and
civil
business
in
the
country
do
not
have
such
guarantees,
but
the
district
is
in
the
united
states,
not
outside
of
it,
and
therefore
it
is
said
the
article
iii
guarantees
must
apply.
i
find
it
hard
to
say,
why
there
is
any
basis
for
a
therefore
there,
because
it's
preferably
plain
if
the
constitution
is,
is
and
always
has
been
applicable
to
the
incorporated
territories.
so
decided
by
this
court,
and
that
any
provisions
of
the
constitution
are
applicable
to
the
unincorporated
territories
as
was
involved
in
weems
against
the
united
states.
the
insurer
in
the
american
insurance
case
was
an
american
corporation
and
it
lost
its
(inaudible)
and
reynolds
was
an
american
citizen
and
he
was
convicted
of
bigamy
by
a
court
which
did
not
have
article
iii
guarantees
and
that
conviction
was
affirmed
by
this
court.
with
respect
to
the
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes,
mr.
chief
justice.
with
respect
to
the
district
of
columbia,
it
was
for
many
years
thought
and
generally
understood,
and
i
say
that
without
any
hesitation,
it
was
for
many
years
thought
and
generally
understood,
i
think
right
down
to
the
day
o'donoghue
case
was
decided,
that
all
of
the
courts
here
were
established
under
article
i.
it
was
on
that
basis
that
they
were
given
various
administrative
powers.
it
was
felt
going
back
to
the
very
earliest
decisions
of
this
court
that
article
iii
courts
could
not
be
assigned
non-judicial
functions
and
it
was
on
that
basis
that
it
was
felt
that
all
of
the
district
of
columbia
court
must
be
article
i
courts
because
they
pointed
members
with
the
school
board
may
have
reviewed
decisions
of
the
patent
office
which
did
not
result
in
final
judgments
and
they
did
various
things
which
was
then
understood
that
article
iii
judges
could
not
do.
certainly,
this
court
understood
that
they
were
all
article
i
courts
when
it
decided
the
bakelite
case
in
1929.
now
the
bakelite
case
is
perhaps
somewhat
under
plate
here,
it's
fairly
far
back
in
the
stream
of
history
on
this
thing,
but
the
bakelite
case
represented
an
understanding
which
i
think
was
general
over
a
period
of
50
or
75
years.
it
was
only
under
the
pressure
of
a
salary
reduction
question
which
conceivably
might
have
affected
the
result
that
this
court
saw
a
new
light
in
1933,
and
that
light
was
not
bright
enough
then
to
illuminate
the
court
of
claims.
moreover,
from
the
beginning
there
have
always
been
article
i
courts
and
judges
in
the
district.
justices
of
the
peace,
police
court,
municipal
court
and
more
recently
the
court
of
general
session,
courts
with
limited
jurisdiction
to
be
sure,
but
surely
exercising
judicial
power
including
substantial
jurisdiction
in
criminal
cases
and
if
the
judicial
power
of
the
united
states
can
only
be
given
to
article
iii
courts,
those
courts
and
all
the
acts
under
them
were
surely
invalid.
it
is
said
that
the
district
is
different
from
the
territories
because
they
were
transitory
while,
the
district
is
permanent.
it's
not
clear
why
this
makes
a
difference
under
article
iii,
article
iii
doesn't
say
anything
about
transitory
or
permanent.
but
as
to
the
transitory
nature
of
the
territories,
we
have
had
puerto
rico
and
guam
and
american
samoa
now
for
75
years
and
the
virgin
islands
now
for
more
than
55
years.
it
is
said
that
they
are
distant,
but
it
takes
only
a
couple
of
hours
to
get
from
here
to
washington
--
get
from
washington
to
puerto
rico
and
the
virgin
islands
and
there
is
instant
communication
with
all
of
these
places.
the
people
there
are
citizens
of
united
states,
no
less
and
no
mores
then
those
of
the
district
of
columbia.
moreover,
the
government
of
the
district
is
not
changeless.
there
is
a
great
deal
of
current
talk
about
home
rule
and
changes
in
congress
may
mean
that
this
is
more
likely
than
it
once
was.
there
is
also
a
talk
about
statehood.
there
would
be
a
considerable
problem
in
achieving
changes
such
as
these,
if
it
should
be
concluded
that
they
should
be
brought
above,
if
more
than
50
judges
on
the
two
court's
below
in
this
case
had
to
be
provided
for
life
and
it
should
not
be
overlooked
that
this
statute
was
enacted
by
the
congress
as
a
result
of
a
clear
crises
in
the
district
court
of
united
states
for
the
district
of
columbia
which
was
simply
overwhelmed
by
the
volume
of
its
criminal
business.
practically
all
of
the
judges
were
sitting
on
criminal
cases
all
of
the
time
and
the
ordinary
work
of
the
district
courts
could
not
be
carried
forward
and
the
congress
provided
this
means
greatly
to
expand
the
number
of
judges
in
the
district
of
columbia
assigned
to
deal
with
local
crimes
and
civil
matters
of
the
same
sort
that
are
dealt
with
by
state
courts
in
the
states.
it
would
be
a
bit
bizarre
if
the
district
of
columbia
became
a
state
to
say
that
the
50
judges
of
these
two
courts
below
must
be
given
life
tenure
if
the
state
court
judges
established
by
the
state
under
statehood
trying
the
same
kind
of
cases
would
not
have
to
have
article
iii
guarantees.
the
congress
expressly
grants
the
constitution,
expressly
grants
to
congress
in
article
i,
clause
17,
power
to
exercise
exclusive
jurisdiction
in
all
cases
whatsoever
and
really
what
could
be
more
comprehensive,
exclusive
jurisdiction
in
all
cases
whatsoever
over
the
district
that
is
accepted
as
a
seat
of
government
of
united
states.
this
court
has
said
that
this
is
a
plenary
part,
there
is
no
doubt
that
the
district
is
different
from
other
parts
of
the
country,
both
legally
and
practically,
until
recently
changed
by
constitutional
amendment
residence
of
the
district
did
not
have
that
most
elemental
right
in
the
democracy,
the
right
to
vote.
they
still
have
no
representation
in
the
senate
and
no
voting
representation
in
the
house,
though
these
bodies
pass
the
laws
that
govern
the
district
and
levy
the
taxes
that
are
applicable
here.
congress
has,
always
had
special
powers
here
and
has
always
exercised
them.
in
this
case,
it
moved
expressly
under
article
i.
the
very
first
section
of
the
district
of
columbia
court
reorganization
act,
section
11-101
and
this
unfortunately
is
not
printed
in
our
brief,
i
think
it
should
have
been
and
i
want
to
bring
it
particularly
to
the
court's
attention.
the
very
first
section
provides
as
follow:
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
section
11-101.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
of
the
dc
court,
that
would
be
of
the
court
reorganization
act
in
the
dc
court.
it
provides
that
the
courts
of
the
districts
of
columbia
are
as
follows,
established
under
article
iii.
1.
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states.
2.
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
circuit.
3.
the
district
court
of
the
united
states
and
then
continuing
quoting
the
statute.
established
under
article
i.
1.
the
district
of
columbia
court
of
appeals.
2.
the
superior
court
of
the
district
of
columbia.
thus
congress
made
it
explicit
that
it
knew
it
was
acting
under
article
i
that
it
intended
to
act
under
article
i
and
that
article
i
was
the
basis
for
the
authority
which
it
was
seeking
to
exercise
in
establishing
the
two
courts
below
in
this
case.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
before
resuming
the
main
threat
of
my
argument,
i
would
like
to
refer
to
a
memorandum
which
mr.
flegal
has
quite
property
filed
with
the
court,
calling
attention
to
a
new
edition
of
the
hart
and
wechsler's
casebook
about
federal
courts
in
particularly
to
a
paragraph
of
a
note
which
appears
on
page
397
of
that
note.
i
would
like
simply
to
suggest
to
the
court
that
they
read
the
entire
note
and
not
just
that
paragraph
on
page
397.
among
other
things
mr.
bator
who
is
the
author
of
this
part
says
in
paragraph
1,
notice
that
the
line
of
argument
made
above
does
not
in
itself
asserts
that
congress
has
unlimited
power
to
assign
federal
judicial
business
to
federal
legislative
courts.
it
simply
asserts
that
article
iii
does
not
rigidly
preclude
congress
from
exercising
some
flexibility
in
allocating
that
judicial
business
and
that
congress
may
make
a
particular
allocation
to
a
non-article
iii
tribunal,
if
functional
considerations
of
serving
a
valid
legislative
purpose
justified
and
if
there
is
adequate
provision
for
judicial
review
or
here
there
is
provision
for
judicial
review
in
all
cases
to
this
court
which
is
of
course
in
article
iii
court
and
then
i
would
like
to
say
that
nothing
in
our
position
requires
the
court
to
overrule
or
to
disapprove
anything
decided
in
the
o'donoghue
case.
the
courts
there
were
held
to
be
both
article
iii
and
article
i
courts
but
there
was
nothing
there
which
held
that
congress
could
not
create
courts
under
article
i
to
deal
with
local
matters
only.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
mr.
justice
if
i
may
put
it
this
way,
i
think
the
majority
of
the
court
that
decided
the
o'donoghue
case,
if
it
were
here
in
1973
would
decide
this
case
the
way
that
i
suggest.
in
1933
when
they
were
deciding
it
they
didn't
have
the
history
that
had
developed.
the
courts
established
the
declaration
of
congress
that
it
was
creating
these
courts
under
article
i.
if
all
of
those
provisions
had
been
before
the
court
in
1933
then
my
answer
would
be
yes,
that
they
would
have
accepted
the
–
let
me
--
i
mentioned
some
of
the
practical
problems
before
congress
and
legislating
here
the
difficulty
of
giving
life
tenure
to
50-60
judges
which
were
needed
but
there
is
also
another
practical
problem
and
that
is
fazing
in
the
judges
under
the
old
system
into
the
new.
the
judges
of
the
court
of
general
sessions
have
not
been
appointed
as
article
iii
judges
and
a
means
of
making
a
transition
was
to
establish
article
i
courts.
then
we
do
not
contend
that
congress
could
create
courts
generally
under
article
i
to
sit
all
over
the
country.
though
i
would
refer
to
the
united
states
tax
court
which
again
congress
has
validly
created
under
article
i
without
life
tenure
and
it
does
sit
all
over
the
country
but
it
has
no
criminal
jurisdiction.
congress
could
not
displace
the
article
iii
courts
in
the
states
by
establishing
article
i
courts
with
general
jurisdiction
or
by
a
series
of
article
i
courts
under
the
commerce
power
and
the
tax
power
and
other
powers.
our
position
this
simply
that
congress
has
broader
powers
over
governmental
organization
in
the
district
than
it
has
in
the
states.
now
let
return
to
the
final
subject
involved
in
the
case,
the
question
of
the
seizure.
this
is
one
of
considerable
importance
to
the
government
and
i
hope
that
i
have
not
left
it
buried
under
a
mass
of
technicalities
in
presenting
the
other
questions
involved.
the
basic
question
is
whether
a
policeman
may
make
a
selective
stop
of
a
motorist
for
the
purpose
of
checking
his
driver's
license
and
registration
certificates.
the
district
of
columbia
law
requires
an
operator
to
have
these
papers
in
his
possession
or
in
the
automobile
and
that
must
mean
something.
it's
not
just
ceremony
that
he
has
to
have
the
papers
in
his
position
there
to
be
there
so
that
they
can
be
shown
on
proper
occasion
unless
they
can
be
checked
by
a
police
officer.
there
is
no
way
to
tell
whether
motor
vehicles
which
are
surely
dangerous
instrumentalities
are
being
validly
operated.
here
the
check
was
no
whim.
the
police
officer
could
tell
from
the
license
plate
that
the
car
was
a
rental
car.
he
knew
that
many
rental
cars
were
held
over
time
which
is
unlawful
or
re-stolen.
in
this
case
the
whole
rental
agreement
did
indeed
indicate
that
the
car
was
overdue,
though
this
was
straightened
out
when
inquiry
was
made.
there
is
no
allegation
that
the
police
officer
acted
improperly,
that
is
in
a
violent
or
a
vicious
manner.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
directly?
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
they
could
be
since
1970
when
it
was
established
as
a
court.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
whether
it's
is
article
i
court
now
and
they
can
be
reviewed
here.
just
as
territorial
judgments
can
be
reviewed
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
the
court
has
always
held
that
it
is
an
exercise
to
judicial
power
and
there
is
appellate
jurisdiction
to
review
the
decisions
of
the
territorial
courts
established
under
article
i.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no.
only
if
it
is
exercising
a
judicial
power
but
regardless
of
whether
it's
under
article
iii
or
article
i.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
that
is
correct.
prior
to
1971
mr.
justice,
the
tax
court,
in
first
place
it
was
the
board
of
tax
appeal,
then
it
was
established
as
the
tax
court
but
because
of
a
curious
history,
the
statute
expressly
provided
that
it
is
an
independent
agency
and
the
executive
branch
for
the
government
and
that
lasted
till
1970.
and
during
that
time
it
was
quite
clear
that
this
court
could
not
review
a
decision
of
the
tax
court.
indeed
there
is
a
case
back
30
years
ago
involving
a
certificate
from
a
court
of
appeals
with
respect
to
a
question
from
the
tax
court
and
this
is
–
i
may
say
this
court
was
always
very
careful.
never
to
remand
their
decision
to
the
tax
court,
it
always
remanded
it
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
remand
to
the
tax
court.
but
here,
there
was
nothing
discriminatory
and
thus
stop
many
citizens
would
welcome
that
has
evidence
that
the
police
where
doing
their
duty.
incidentally,
the
statute
of
the
district
of
columbia
does
not
say
that
the
policeman
may
stop
the
car,
but
it
does
say
expressly
that
any
individual
to
whom
has
been
issued
a
permit
to
operate
a
motor
vehicle
shall
add
such
permit
in
his
immediate
possession
at
all
times,
when
operating
a
motor
vehicle
in
the
district
and
shall
exhibit
such
permit
to
any
police
officer
when
demand
is
made
therefore.
this
case
we
think
is
like
the
biswell
case,
where
people
realizes
to
deal
in
firearms
and
this
court
held
that
they
were
subject
to
inspect
it,
indeed
said
that
it
is
to
be
effective
in
service
a
credible
deterrent
unannounced
even
frequent
inspections
are
essential.
if
a
motor
is
chooses
to
drive
pursuant
to
a
license
for
which
he
has
applied,
he
does
so
with
a
knowledge
that
he
maybe
required
at
any
time
to
establish
that
he
is
doing
so
in
unconformity
with
the
law.
under
the
circumstances
such
checks
post
at
most
only
limited
threats
to
the
motorist
privacy,
and
no
threat
which
is
not
justified
by
his
acceptance
of
the
license
and
the
operation
under
it.
i
note
that
persons
who
wish
to
enter
this
court
room
they
have
to
submit
themselves
to
an
inspection
which
includes
the
opening
of
parcels,
and
the
opening
of
ladies
handbag,
i
would
not
suppose
there
was
any
question
about
that
and
i
see
no
basis
for
a
question
in
the
light
of
the
district
of
columbia
statute
with
respect
to
the
request
for
licenses
in
this
case.
if
the
stock
was
proper,
the
protective
action
of
officer
morris
had
and
looking
to
see
if
there
are
any
weapons
available
was
clearly
proper
under
the
general
rationale
of
terry
against
ohio
and
the
search
should
be
sustained.
if
the
court
reaches
the
merits
of
the
case,
the
judgment
of
the
district
of
columbia
court
of
appeals
should
be
affirmed.
