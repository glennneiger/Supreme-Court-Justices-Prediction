and
864,
865
and

mr.
solicitor
general.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
are
these
taking
the
form
of
hearings
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
in
the
--
in
the
rule
making
tradition?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
you
suggest
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
you
suggest,
mr.
solicitor
general
that
if
the
federal
communications
commission
had
this
obligation
that's
being
sought
that
it
would
mean
that
the
commission
would
also
have
to
step
in
and
put
some
limits
on
the
amount
of
advertising,
time
which
could
be
used
and
at
what
hours?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
solicitor
general.
mr.
jennes.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
does
the
failure
of
a
licensee
to
observe
the
fairness
doctrine,
give
a
balance
(inaudible)
sometimes
become
an
issue
and
they
come
up
for
a
renewal
of
the
license?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
you're
suggesting
that's
a
sufficient
control
over
balancing
as
against
unbalanced
programs?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
understood
mr.
justice
white's
question
going
to
unclaimed
the
potential
stations,
no
other
any
or
very
many
unclaimed
in
large
market
areas?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
think
your
time
is
up,
mr.
jennes.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
wollenberg.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
think
we'll
let
you
respond
to
that
right
after
we
lunch.
mr.
wollenberg,
you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
mr.
wollenberg.
mr.
califano.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
califano,
while
we
have
you
stopped
--
would
it
be
reasonable
and
appropriate
for
the
federal
communications
commission
under
your
formulation
to
say
yes
the
network
or
the
station
must
make
that
time
available
on
those
terms
provided
that
they
make
an
equal
amount
of
time
available
within
the
same
five-minute
span
for
the
contrary
view?
it
is
a
45-second
against
something
and
then
that
they
must
allow
a
45-second
plug
right
afterward
for
the
contrary
minded.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
wouldn't
this
--
wouldn't
this
hypothetical
situation
i
have
just
suggested
be
an
implementation
in
a
precise
way
of
what
the
fairness
doctrine
is
driving
at?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
on
the
fairness
question
lies,
would
this
be
a
reasonable
solution?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
i
--
i've
always
been
under
the
impression,
mr.
califano,
that
the
legislative
history
of
the
act
negates
the
idea
of
a
governmental
control
of
the
content,
is
that
not
true?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
are
not
suggesting
mr.
califano
that
all
networks
and
all
stations
are
now
exercising
such
a
limitation,
are
you?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
spot
announcements
too,
wouldn't
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
other
words,
when
there
is
no
campaign
--
election
campaign
on,
that's
what's
you're
complaining
about?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you'd
have
different
question,
would
you
not
if
you
could
show
that
particular
network
would
sell
spot
announcements
and
the
others
that
you
want
to
one
political
party
but
not
to
any
other
political
party.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
that's
not
--
that's
not
the
situation
you
have
here,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
this
is
a
classification
made
by
the
licensees
and
approved
or
at
least
not
disapproved
by
the
commission.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
i
thought
you
were
addressing
yourself
to
just
the
statutory
aspect?
are
--
are
you
--
well,
are
you
saying
that
section
301
standing
alone
is
enough
to
support
the
court
of
appeals'
view?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
mr.
califano.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
asher.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
when
you
--
when
you
say
that
the
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
the
newspaper
was
characterized
as
a
purely
private
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it
is
the
same
distinction
justice
stewart
has
been
making.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
asher
the
language
following
that
quoted
portion
that
you
referred
to
in
the
united
church
of
christ
case
went
on
to
say
in
effect
that
the
--
when
they
come
to
the
renewal
of
their
license,
they're
held
to
an
accounting
of
their
stewardship
in
terms
of
whether
they've
been
operating
on
whim
and
caprice
or
whether
they've
been
operating
in
the
public
interest.
it's
quite
a
different
matter
from
the
inverse
of
prior
restraint
or
prior
compulsion
that
you're
talking
about
here
now.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now,
let's
take
that
last
two
hypothetical
you
gave,
suppose
a
city
had
an
ordinance
that
it
would
grant
licenses
permits
for
parades,
for
people
in
noncommercial
categories
that
is
to
advertise
their
views
on
war
or
public
health
or
whatever.
but
that
they
would
not
allow
any
parade
permits
to
advertise
soap,
and
beer,
and
whatnot,
would
that
be
a
reasonable
classification
of
the
use
of
a
public
area?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
haven't
--
haven't
they
made
--
hasn't
the
fcc
made
a
classification
here?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
yes.
i
noticed.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
noticed.
but
they've
made
--
they've
have
made
a
classification
on
--
and
once
you
get
over
the
hurdle
of
whether
this
is
governmental
action,
you
still
have
to
demonstrate
this
is
an
unreasonable
and
impermissible
classification.
do
you
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
it
hasn't
done
quite
that
though,
has
it?
it
--
it
has
the
governmentally
license
entity
here
as
merely
said
that
the
political
speech
will
be
allowed
just
during
political
campaign,
so
you
have
another
classification.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
asher.
thank
you
gentlemen.
mr.
wilkinson,
you
have
seven
and
a
half
minutes.
chief

you
