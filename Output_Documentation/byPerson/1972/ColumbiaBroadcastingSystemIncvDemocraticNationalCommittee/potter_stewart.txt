justice

well,
that's
right.
because
they
were

they
were
equating

and
they
were
saying
that
the

had
no

exercise

kind
of

--
justice

--
that's
exactly
the

justice

stewart
well,
maybe
somebody

until

the

in

when

down
an

there
cannot
possibly
be

that
that's
a

right

that's

in

here
that
the

unless

can

that

the

is
simply

justice

in

justice

justice

that
while

it
did
not
--
justice

--
violate
their

justice

because

justice

that

that

would

to
the

that

justice

stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
wollenberg
during
lunch
maybe
you
can
tend
to
the
answer
this
question.
do
you
think
there's
any
difference
in
the
test
of
state
action
when
you're
dealing
with
the
equal
protection
clause
of
fourteenth
amendment
as
in
burton
from
the
test
applicable
when
you're
dealing
with
the
first
amendment
as
in
marsh
or
the
shopping
center
case
or
should
the
test
be
identical
constitutionally?
justice
potter
stewart
certainly
not
a
concept
though
that
has
any
relevance
to
the
first
amendment,
is
it?
justice
potter
stewart
the
first
amendment
doesn't
allow
the
government
to
control
the
speech
of
their
responsible
people,
does
it?
justice
potter
stewart
well
--
justice
potter
stewart
let's
assume
just
dealing
with
the
first
amendment
plain
out
now,
forget
the
communications
act.
if
these
broadcasters
were
newspapers
surely
they
would
be
wholly
correct
in
their
point
of
view,
wouldn't
they?
justice
potter
stewart
this
would
be
the
absolute
right
under
the
first
amendment,
wouldn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
just
answer
that
question.
justice
potter
stewart
just
to
make
sure
i
understand
you
(voice
overlap)
justice
potter
stewart
well,
certainly
they
are
different
but
i
just
want
to
be
sure
i
--
that
you
go
at
least
that
far
under
the
first
amendment
that
if
--
that
if
these
were
ordinary,
that
if
these
were
newspapers,
they
would
have
an
absolute
right
to
print
want
they
wanted
and
to
refuse
to
print
what
anybody
wanted
them
to,
government
or
private
individual,
wouldn't
that
be
true?
justice
potter
stewart
and
that
would
be
a
first
amendment
right
(voice
overlap)
justice
potter
stewart
--
that
would
be
reason
they
have
that
right,
wouldn't
that?
justice
potter
stewart
all
right.
justice
potter
stewart
now,
is
that
--
insofar
as
your
argument
does
rely
on
the
first
amendment,
that
seems
to
me
an
extraordinary
thing
to
say
that
government
can
make
judgments
as
to
what
--
what
it
will
suppress
and
what
it
won't.
that's
exactly
what
the
first
amendment
does
not
permit,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
so
we
have
a
finite
spectrum.
justice
potter
stewart
but
then
--
but
then
you
say
that
the
broadcasters
which
you
equate
to
government
can
say
--
we'll
--
or
must
say,
“we'll
let
you
speak
because
you're
responsible.”
but
may
say,
“we
won't
let
you
speak
because
you're
irresponsible.”
now,
that's
an
extraordinary
limitation
of
the
first
amendment
of
the
united
states
constitution,
it
seems
to
me.
justice
potter
stewart
that
--
that
contradicts
that
term,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
that
language
of
the
first
amendment
says,
“congress
shall
not
abridge,”
doesn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
they
can't
buy
unless
the
networks
sell
it.
justice
potter
stewart
is
there
--
there
is
no
rule,
is
there
about
the
--
the
commission
that
requires
the
network
to
sell
it
to
religious
organizations?
justice
potter
stewart
the
question
is
here,
the
freedom
of
the
networks
to
--
or
the
stations
or
broadcasters
to
--
to
sell
or
not
to
sell,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
yes,
their
right
to
have
a
general
rule
that
we
will
not
sell
time
for
this
purpose.
justice
potter
stewart
so
their
freedom
not
to
sell
time
for
this
purpose,
that's
the
issue,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
i
--
i
didn't,
i
said,
“if
we
were
dealing
with
the
newspaper.”
i
know
the
red
lion
--
red
lion
could've
been
decided
the
way
it
was
if
a
broadcaster
is
the
same
as
a
newspaper
because
clearly
the
government
under
the
first
amended
doesn't
have
power
to
tell
newspapers
to
be
fair
and
balance
their
reporting
or
anything
else.
the
newspapers
have
an
absolute
right
to
be
unfair.
and
we
held
that
in
red
lion
that
broadcasters
do
not
so
obviously,
they're
not
the
equivalent.
justice
potter
stewart
i
didn't
suggest
they
were.
justice
potter
stewart
if
these
were
the
(inaudible)
justice
potter
stewart
(voice

--
justice
potter
stewart
have
you
said
all
you're
going

addressed
to
the
point
that
broadcasters
are
government?
justice
potter
stewart
if
that's
--
if
that's
true
then
--
then
i
don't
see
how
a
broadcaster
who
would
have
any
power
whatsoever
to
limit
or
censor
anything
on
--
on
his
station.
justice
potter
stewart
well
that's
--
that's
an
equal
protection
argument.
justice
potter
stewart
that's
very
much
what
it
sounds
like
really.
justice
potter
stewart
i
think
that
that's
an
argument
not
a
--
that
too,
it
depends
first
of
all
upon
the
equating
a
broadcaster
with
government
but
equal
protection
is
something
else
and
that's
really
what
--
you
would
agree
i
think
that
the
court
of

opinion
is
heavily
larded
with
equal
protection
(voice

justice
potter

you
say
that

can

and
it
does
all
the

justice

stewart
about

is
there
any

kind
of
a

justice

the
first

the

isn't
