mr.

please

questions
were
asked
to
counsel
for
dnc.
on
what
section
is
the
communications
act,
they
were
relying
it
has
been
violated
by
the
commission's
decision.
in
that
connection,
i
would
like
to
call
to
this
court's
attention
to
emphasize
that
on
these
four
occasions,
congress
has
had
opportunities
to
prescribe
a
right
of
access
for
the
presentation
of
contrasting
views
on
controversial
issues
and
each
instance
has
refused
to
go
that
far.
first
of
all
that
the
radio
act
of
1927
was
referenced
to
candidates
for
public
office.
they
did
put
in
a
provision
which
was
carried
over
again
when
the
act
was
reenacted
as
communications
act
of
1934.
that
time
has
made
available
by
the
broadcaster
to
one
candidate.
he
must
likewise
make
available
time
to
other
candidates
for
the
same
office.
but
the
statute
went
on
--
the
statute
immediately
went
on
with
(inaudible)
to
this
effect.
no
obligation
is
imposed
upon
any
licensee
to
allow
the
use
of
its
station
for
any
such
candidate.
that
was
the
provisions
up
until
1959,
except
for
the
standard
of
public
interest
and
the
report
on
editorializing
in
1949.
however,
in
1959,
after
the
lar
daly
episode,
congress
restricted
still
further,
this
equal
time
requirement
even
for
candidates
by
eliminating
bona
fide
a
newscast,
by
eliminating
bona
fide
news
interviews,
bona
fide
documentaries,
and
on
the
spot
coverage
bona
fide
news
events.
now,
we
come
in
next
to
the
--
the
campaign
expenditure
act
of
1971
which
became
effective
april
7,
1972,
but
congress
provided
that
licensees
could
be
revoked
for
willful
or
repeated
failure
to
allow
reasonable
acces
to
or
to
permit
purchase
of
reasonable
amount
of
time
for
the
use
of
a
broadcasting
station
by
a
legally
qualified
candidate
for
federal
elective
office.
federal
only,
not
state.
now,
you
all
notice
that
they
use
the
word
“or”
either
access
of
permit
purchase
of
reasonable
time.
it
doesn't
say
purchase
and
purchase
their
reasonable
time.congress
was
perfectly
familiar
after
1959
and
after
this
court's
decision
in
red
lion.
that
broadcaster
was
under
an
obligation
to
see
that
all
sides
of
controversial
issues
were
presented.
and
therefore,
the
stations
are
under
a
duty
to
provide
time
either
free
of
charge
or
on
a
paid
basis
and
that
is
a
policy
which
most
of
the
--
the
three
networks
for
the
most
part
have
followed,
with
reference
the
controversial
issues.
we
present
the
time
free.
now,
congress
--
the
commission
has
gone
further
after
the
expenditure
--
the
campaign
expenditure
act
was
enacted.
question
was
asked
by
meredith
publishing
company
which
owns
several
television
stations
and
radio
stations.
can
we
continue
our
policy
under
that
statute?
i'm
making
time
available
free
only
to
candidates
and
not
selling
time
and
thereby
keeping
a
complete
balance,
and
not
the
richest
candidate
getting
more
spots,
and
the
poorest
candidate
being
(inaudible)
only
by
one
spot,
because
on
time
for
sale
for
--
for
candidates
for
public
office,
the
fairness
doctrine
as
i
understand
is
not
directly
applicable.
the
commission
held
that
meredith
publishing
company
could
--
could
continue
to
make
time
available
on
a
free
basis
and
not
be
required
to
sell
time
for
--
for
campaign
purposes.
and
that's
even
and
--
i
think
that
we
have
therefore
an
a
fortiori
situation
when
we
get
into
the
subject
of
controversial
issues.so
we
do
not
have
here
a
question
of
selling
time
to
the
commercial
advertising,
and
refusing
to
sell
time
for
the
person
who
wants
to
expose
ideas.
we
sell
time
to
the
commercial
advertiser
to
advertise
his
product.
we
give
time
for
the
presentation
of
controversial
issues.
mr.

we
have

we
did

the

this

and
much
--
much
emphasis
placed
on
united
broadcasting
company
case
in
1945
by
the
respondents.
the
commission
was
groping
with
this
fairness
doctrine.

true
there's
some
mention
made
of

in

back
in

but
it
was
not
until
a
report
on
editorializing
in
1949
that
the
commission
finally
expounded
his
fairness
doctrine
in
a
much
the
same
form
than
it
is
at
present
except
for
the
additional
provisions
about,
first,
to
attack
rules
and
matters
of
that
kind.
we
do
not
consider
united
broadcasting
company
case,
so
therefore
as
controlling
in
view
of
the
1941
report
on
editorializing
and
the
fairness
doctrine
itself
as
announced
by
the
commission.
and
i
would
like
therefore
to
call
to
the
commission's
attention
--
to
the
court's
attention
as
a
more
authoritative
pronouncement
than
the
united
broadcasting
company
case,
a
decision
by
a
different
panel
of
this
circuit
court
of

for
the

before

where
we
state
that
