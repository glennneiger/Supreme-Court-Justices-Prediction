mr.
ernest
w.
jennes
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
wollenberg
and
i
have
divided
the
issues
we
will
argue.
i
will
briefly
supplement
the
solicitor
general's
description
of
how
the
present
system
works
and
assuming,
but
not
conceding
state
action.
we'll
treat
the
first
amendment
issues.
mr.
wollenberg
will
argue
the
state
action
issue
which
mr.
justice
stewart
has
raised,
the
commercial
discrimination
equal
protection
issue
and
the
question
of
statutory
construction.
it
would
perhaps
be
helpful
if
i
review
briefly
some
pertinent
aspects
of
broadcasting
and
their
relationship
to
first
amendment
interest.
dnc
will
have
this
court,
view
broadcasting
as
a
virtually
monolithic
institution
in
which
there
are
three
network
presidents
who
decide
what
the
american
people
will
hear,
and
when,
and
how.
but
this
is
not
the
way
it
works.
as
the
networks
agreed
to
show,
this
is
a
caricature
of
how
the
networks
handle
news
and
information.
but
more
important,
some
7000
individual
broadcasters
are
entrusted
with
the
responsibility
of
fairly
informing
the
public.
and
these
independent
stations
and
the
many
individual
and
often
partisan
voices
that
speak
through
these
7000
stations
provide
diverse
ideas
and
opinions
to
the
public.
mr.
ernest
w.
jennes
it
has
indeed,
and
the
commission's
refusal
to
renew
a
license
on
that
ground
was
recently
sustained
by
the
--
by
the
court
of
appeals.
fairness
doctrine
complaints
are
--
have
the
present
commission
rules
on
them
and
the
broadcasters
are
very
aware
of
the
problem.
mr.
ernest
w.
jennes
i
am
suggesting
that
there
is
no
evidence.
i
will
show
--
i
believe
that
there
is
no
evidence
that
the
system
as
it
exist
has
been
abused
and
accordingly
that
--
assuming
our
first
amendment
question
that
the
congress
and
the
commission
have
not
exercise
the
--
a
--
a
choice
which
serves
the
interest
of
the
first
amendment
through
the
fairness
doctrine.
public
exposure
to
conflicting
views
in
partisan
voices
is
advanced
by
the
fairness
doctrine
and
the
related
requirements
of
the
communications
act.
each
station
is
responsible
for
determining
from
the
public
on
a
continuing
basis
what
it
--
the
public
and
representative
groups,
and
organizations
regard
as
public
issues,
needs,
and
interests.
now,
there's
discretion
to
present
these
viewpoints
in
a
variety
of
ways,
including
hard
news,
commentaries,
special
events'
coverage,
documentaries
and
the
like.
but
very
importantly
for
these
cases
where
access
is
being
argued,
stations
must
include
under
the
commission's
fairness
doctrine
as
part
of
a
mix
representative
partisan
spokesman
on
controversial
issues.
now,
subject
to
these
trusteeship
obligations,
each
broadcaster
exercises
a
journalistic
function
in
selecting
and
balancing
subjects,
formats
and
speakers
for
the
very
purpose
of
assuring
that
a
significant
variety
of
important
issues
and
competing
viewpoints
is
affectively
presented.
some
sell
time
or
commercials
to
partisans.
others
do
not
sell
time
but
provide
access
to
partisan
views
without
charge
in
their
normal
programing.
how
this
system
works
to
serve
first
amendment
purposes
is
well-demonstrated
in
the
bem
case
itself.
the
uncontroverted
record
is
that
the
various
aspects
of
the
vietnam
issue
were
repeatedly
covered
in
wtop's
news
information
and
public
affairs
programs.
moreover,
numerous
partisan's
spokesmen
had
access,
in
fact,
to
wtop
without
charge
to
express
their
varying
views
and
varying
ways.
every
viewpoint
in
the
14
different
samples
of
bem
commercials
for
which
bem
sought
by
time
on
wtop
was
in
fact
expressed
over
that
station.
and
furthermore,
several
stations
in
the
area
was
different
policies
carried
bem's
commercials.
it
would
thus,
i
submit,
be
incredible
to
suggest
that
wtop
deprive
the
public
of
access
to
the
ideas
which
were
advocated
by
bem.
now,
this
court
has
repeatedly
stated
that
the
central
purpose
of
the
first
amendment
is
to
preserve
a
marketplace
of
ideas
for
the
american
people
and
it
has
long
emphasized
that
the
first
amendment
must
work
differently
in
different
context.
and
when
this
court
defined
the
first
amendment
interest
in
broadcasting
in
red
lion,
it
was
the
public's
right
to
receive
suitable
access
to
social,
political,
esthetic,
moral
and
other
ideas
and
experiences
on
which
the
court
focused.
in
red
lion,
it
was
the
public's
right
to
know
not
the
individual's
right
to
speak
which
control
them.
because
of
broadcasting's
limited
capacity,
congress
and
the
commission
may
constitutionally
subordinate
private
claims
to
the
paramount
public
interest,
whether
those
claims
are
advanced
by
broadcasters
themselves
as
in
red
lion
or
in
behalf
of
individuals
who
want
to
speak
their
views.
there
are
simply
more
individuals
who
want
to
broadcast
than
there
are
frequencies
to
--
to
accommodate
them.
there
are
simply
more
subjects
to
report
on
and
treat,
than
time
will
permit.there
must
be
a
responsible
choice.
mr.
ernest
w.
jennes
there
are
in
some
places
in
the
country.
in
--
in
uhf
television,
there
are
many
areas
in
the
country
where
there
are
no
frequencies
available
and
in
--
in
radio,
the
situation
varies
from
community
to
community,
area
to
area.
mr.
ernest
w.
jennes
oh,
mr.
justice
white,
i'm
--
i'm
assuming
for
the
--
you
mean
in
the
fairness
doctrine?
i
--
i
assume
that
--
that
the
--
the
issue
of
the
constitutionality
of
the
fairness
doctrine
was
disposed
of
in
red
lion,
and
i'm
assuming
further
for
purposes
of
my
argument
--
mr.
ernest
w.
jennes
--
that
there
is
state
action.
mr.
ernest
w.
jennes
well,
i'm
--
i'm
asserting
that
--
that
an
individual
radio
or
television
station
has
a
limited
amount
of
time
and
responsible
choice
has
to
be
made
as
to
what
is
going
to
be
covering
in
that
time.
mr.
ernest
w.
jennes
that
is
correct.
mr.
ernest
w.
jennes
that
is
correct
and
that's
--
that's
precisely
why
the
act
has
placed
the
responsibility
on
the
individual
broadcaster
as
a
trustee.
mr.
ernest
w.
jennes
and
that
--
that
term
has
been
--
has
been
repeated,
and
repeated.
the
obligation
of
the
broadcaster
as
a
trustee,
subject
to
the
fairness
doctrine
and
subject
to
other
requirements
to
inform
the
public
fairly
about
controversial
issues
of
public
importance.
mr.
ernest
w.
jennes
they're
not
very
many
in
large
market
areas,
mr.
chief
justice.and
i
take
it
that
the
--
that
the
holding
of
the
court
below
and
that
the
position
of
the
respondents
in
this
case
would
not
vary
from
city
to
city
or
state
to
state.
what
they're
claiming
is
that
--
that
broadcasters
may
not
--
as
a
matter
of
policy
refuse
to
sell
time
for
editorial
commercials.
now,
the
respondents,
i
--
i
suggest
that
--
that
to
the
extent
there
is
a
constitutional
requirement,
that
that
requirement
has
been
served
by
the
system
as
it
operate.
now,
the
respondents
would
have
this
court
create
a
new
constitutional
right
without
showing
any
abuse
requiring
vindication.
now,
i
think
it's
very
important
to
emphasize
that
their
arguments
depend
on
factual
propositions
of
dubious
validity
at
best,
advanced
in
their
briefs
for
the
first
time,
never
submitted
to
the
commission
that
the
--
that
the
fairness
doctrine
does
not
work
adequately,
that
their
proposal
is
fair
and
efficient
and
would
not
have
significant
adverse
effects.
i
would
suggest
that
the
very
heavy
burden
on
those
would
establish
new
constitutional
principles,
is
not
met
by
selected
examples
in
appellate
briefs.
on
the
other
hand,
the
constitutional
right
urged
by
bem
and
dnc
would
post
very
serious
practical
and
legal
problems,
and
would
deserve
first
amendment
interest
by
increasing
the
influence
of
the
wealthy
and
the
powerful,
by
resolving
any
distortion,
and
by
impairing
the
broadcasters
capacity
to
provide
balance
coverage
of
issues,
and
by
increasing
government
control
over
the
flow
of
information.
such
a
new
constitutional
right
would
greatly
advantage
the
size
of
the
(inaudible)
in
determining
what
is
broadcast.
there's
a
tendency
to
think
of
the
implications
of
these
cases
in
terms
of
organizations
like
bem
or
the
navy
league
or
the
ada
or
the
john
birch
society.
but
this
new
right,
if
it
were
established,
would
require
our
broadcasters
to
permit
a
host
of
commercial
advertisers
who
spend
in
the
neighborhood
of
a
billion
and
a
half
dollars
a
year
on
the
networks
and
another
billion
dollars
a
year
in
national
television
advertising
to
use
their
television
and
radio
commercials
for
the
expression
of
views
on
controversial
issues
that
serve
their
business
interest
and
their
other
interests
rather
than
to
sell
their
products
and
services.
now,
it
is
apparently
a
common
policy
of
broadcasters
not
to
permit
advertisers
to
do
this
now.
the
court
below
and
all
of
the
parties
recognize
that
it
would
not
serve
the
public
interest
in
free
speech
that
the
expression
of
views
and
editorial
advertising
time
were
dominated
by
those
who
can
most
afford
to
pay
or
if
a
newly
asserted
constitutional
right
resulted
in
imbalanced
treatment
of
public
issues.
and
the
lower
court
fell
back
as
the
solicitor
general
said
on
the
fairness
doctrine
for
an
answer,
but
this
would
exacerbate
the
problem.
if
a
broadcaster
balance
what
judge
wright
described
as
a
one-sided
flood
of
editorial
advertisements
by
presenting
contrary
view
point's,
he
would
have
to
divert
kind
from
or
ignore
other
subjects
which
warranted
attention.
the
result,
the
agenda
of
news
and
information
presented
to
the
american
people
would
be
determined
by
the
purchasers
of
editorial
advertisements.
mr.
ernest
w.
jennes
not
--
that
is
because
of
the
necessity
of
the
fairness
doctrine
itself.
mr.
ernest
w.
jennes
it
would
be
--
exactly,
exactly.
what
i'm
suggesting
is
that
a
--
that
a
heavy
flight
of
commercials
would
create
an
--
an
obligation
to
respond
and
then
hurry
where
one
is
left
under
cullman.
mr.
ernest
w.
jennes
moreover,
increasing
involvement
of
the
government
cannot
be
avoided
if
editorial
advertising
is
made
compulsive.
innumerable
questions
would
arise
as
to
the
permissible
subject
of
advertisements,
the
content
of
particular
ads
and
a
like.
mr.
ernest
w.
jennes
let
me
conclude
by
saying
that
the
threat
of
intimate
direct
and
pervasive
government
regulation
to
broadcast
content
--
of
content
would
be
serious.
and
there's
literally
nothing
before
this
court
to
require
to
say
that
these
hazards
must
be
sanctioned
and
irreversibly
because
of
a
constitutional
command.
mr.
ernest
w.
jennes
mr.

justice

may
it

court.

of
my
argument
--
mr.
ernest
w.
jennes
--
that
there
is
state
action.
mr.
ernest
w.
jennes
well,
i'm
--
i'm
asserting
that
--
that
an
individual
radio
or
television
station
has
a
limited
amount
of
time
and
responsible
choice
has
to
be
made
as
to
what
is
going
to
be
covering
in
that
time.
mr.
ernest
w.
jennes
that
is
correct.
mr.
ernest
w.
jennes
that
is
correct
and
that's
--
that's
precisely
why
the
act
has
placed
the
responsibility
on
the
individual
broadcaster
as
a
trustee.
mr.
ernest
w.
jennes
and
that
--
that
term
has
been
--
has
been
repeated,
and
repeated.
the
obligation
of
the
broadcaster
as
a
trustee,
subject
to
the
fairness
doctrine
and
subject
to
other
requirements
to
inform
the
public
fairly
about
controversial
issues
of
public
importance.
mr.
ernest
w.
jennes
they're
not
very
many
in
large
market
areas,
mr.
chief
justice.and
i
take
it
that
the
--
that
the
holding
of
the
court
below
and
that
the
position
of
the
respondents
in
this
case
would
not
vary
from
city
to
city
or
state
to
state.
what
they're
claiming
is
that
--
that
broadcasters
may
not
--
as
a
matter
of
policy
refuse
to
sell
time
for
editorial
commercials.
now,
the
respondents,
i
--
i
suggest
that
--
that
to
the
extent
there
is
a
constitutional
requirement,
that
that
requirement
has
been
served
by
the
system
as
it
operate.
now,
the
respondents
would
have
this
court
create
a
new
constitutional
right
without
showing
any
abuse
requiring
vindication.
now,
i
think
it's
very
important
to
emphasize
that
their
arguments
depend
on
factual
propositions
of
dubious
validity
at
best,
advanced
in
their
briefs
for
the
first
time,
never
submitted
to
the
commission
that
the
--
that
the
fairness
doctrine
does
not
work
adequately,
that
their
proposal
is
fair
and
efficient
and
would
not
have
significant
adverse
effects.
i
would
suggest
that
the
very
heavy
burden
on
those
would
establish
new
constitutional
principles,
is
not
met
by
selected
examples
in
appellate
briefs.
on
the
other
hand,
the
constitutional
right
urged
by
bem
and
dnc
would
post
very
serious
practical
and
legal
problems,
and
would
deserve
first
amendment
interest
by
increasing
the
influence
of
the
wealthy
and
the
powerful,
by
resolving
any
distortion,
and
by
impairing
the
broadcasters
capacity
to
provide
balance
coverage
of
issues,
and
by
increasing
government
control
over
the
flow
of
information.
such
a
new
constitutional
right
would
greatly
advantage
the
size
of
the
(inaudible)
in
determining
what
is
broadcast.
there's
a
tendency
to
think
of
the
implications
of
these
cases
in
terms
of
organizations
like
bem
or
the
navy
league
or
the
ada
or
the
john
birch
society.
but
this
new
right,
if
it
were
established,
would
require
our
broadcasters
to
permit
a
host
of
commercial
advertisers
who
spend
in
the
neighborhood
of
a
billion
and
a
half
dollars
a
year
on
the
networks
and
another
billion
dollars
a
year
in
national
television
advertising
to
use
their
television
and
radio
commercials
for
the
expression
of
views
on
controversial
issues
that
serve
their
business
interest
and
their
other
interests
rather
than
to
sell
their
products
and
services.
now,
it
is
apparently
a
common
policy
of
broadcasters
not
to
permit
advertisers
to
do
this
now.
the
court
below
and
all
of
the
parties
recognize
that
it
would
not
serve
the
public
interest
in
free
speech
that
the
expression
of
views
and
editorial
advertising
time
were
dominated
by
those
who
can
most
afford
to
pay
or
if
a
newly
asserted
constitutional
right
resulted
in
imbalanced
treatment
of
public
issues.
and
the
lower
court
fell
back
as
the
solicitor
general
said
on
the
fairness
doctrine
for
an
answer,
but
this
would
exacerbate
the
problem.
if
a
broadcaster
balance
what
judge
wright
described
as
a
one-sided
flood
of
editorial
advertisements
by
presenting
contrary
view
point's,
he
would
have
to
divert
kind
from
or
ignore
other
subjects
which
warranted
attention.
the
result,
the
agenda
of
news
and
information
presented
to
the
american
people
would
be
determined
by
the
purchasers
of
editorial
advertisements.
mr.
ernest
w.
jennes
not
--
that
is
because
of
the
necessity
of
the
fairness
doctrine
itself.
mr.
ernest
w.
jennes
it
would
be
--
exactly,
exactly.
what
i'm
suggesting
is
that
a
--
that
a
heavy
flight
of
commercials
would
create
an
--
an
obligation
to
respond
and
then
hurry
where
one
is
left
under
cullman.
mr.
ernest
w.
jennes
moreover,
increasing
involvement
of
the
government
cannot
be
avoided
if
editorial
advertising
is
made
compulsive.
innumerable
questions
would
arise
as
to
the
permissible
subject
of
advertisements,
the
content
of
particular
ads
and
a
like.
mr.
ernest
w.
jennes
let
me
conclude
by
saying
that
the
threat
of
intimate
direct
and
pervasive
government
regulation
to
broadcast
content
--
of
content
would
be
serious.
and
there's
literally
nothing
before
this
court
to
require
to
say
that
these
hazards
must
be
sanctioned
and
irreversibly
because
of
a
constitutional
command.
