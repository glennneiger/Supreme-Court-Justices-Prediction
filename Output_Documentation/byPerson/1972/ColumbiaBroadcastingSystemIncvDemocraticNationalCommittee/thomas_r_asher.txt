mr.
thomas
r.
asher
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
because
i
--
i
feel
that
perhaps
the
argument
has
--
has
taken
a
path
of
obstruction,
i
would
beg,
leave
to
try
to
focus
upon
the
specific
facts
present
in
the
bem
case
to
illustrate
the
exact
nature
of
the
issue
before
the
court.
the
narrowness
of
that
issue
has
held
by
the
court
below.
the
issue
is
one
of
discrimination,
broadcasters
voluntarily
determine
that
in
order
raise
revenue,
they're
going
to
put
a
certain
portion
of
their
airtime
up
for
sale
and
market
it
to
others.
and
if
those
other
persons
are
going
to
use
that
time
to
speak.
bem
approaches
--
approached
the
broadcaster
that
did
just
that
with
18
out
of
every
60
minutes
is
on
the
air,
wtop
radio
station
sought
to
purchase
time.
it
was
turned
down,
not
for
any
of
the
reasons
suggested
by
the
petitioners,
not
because
the
speech
was
obscene,
indecent,
defamatory
or
might
somehow
otherwise
be
in
violation
of
some
specific
law.
but
solely
and
exclusively
on
the
basis
of
a
policy
which
is
set
out
at
page
297
of
the
appendix.
i
quote,
“it
is
the
policy
of
post-newsweek
stations,
radio
and
television
stations
not
to
sell
spot
announcement
time
to
individuals
or
groups
in
order
to
set
forth
a
point
of
view
on
any
controversial
subject
of
pubic
importance.
and
that
presents
the
clear,
narrow
issue
that
was
decided
by
the
court
below.
that's
a
flat
ban
on
selling
time
which
is
regularly
marketed
to
commercial
spokesman
to
people
who
wish
to
speak
about
controversial
subjects.
in
brief,
such
a
policy
as
we
view
the
--
the
ruling
of
the
court
below
and
as
this
case
is
presented
involves
no
question
of
creating
a
new
constitutional
right
--
of
right
of
access
as
--
as
it's
phrased.
rather,
it
deals
specifically
with
a
question
of
whether
or
not
assuming
for
the
moment,
i
will
address
state
action.
assuming
that
the
action
of
the
broadcaster
is
either
itself
state
action
or
because
of
firm
and
approved
by
the
regulatory
agency
state
action,
whether
or
not
this
discrimination,
barring
for
first
amendment
protected
speech,
in
and
of
itself,
is
violative
of
the
first
amendment.
it
doesn't
mean
that
every
person
has
a
right
to
speak,
but
rather
a
right
not
to
be
excluded
on
such
a
discriminatory
ground.
we
would
suggest
primarily
that
--
that
reading
cases
like
valentine
against
chrestensen,
and
breard
versus
alexandria,
the
--
the
approach
taken
by
the
broadcasters
in
terms
of
their
marketing
of
time
turns
constitutional
values
on
their
head
because
this
court
has
time
and
again
in
those
cases
held
that
the
first
amendment
protects
political
speech.
it
does
not
protect
commercial
speech.
it
somehow
rather
the
commercial
speaker
when
he
wishes
to
--
to
address
particular
issue
or
the
merits
of
his
product
or
otherwise
in
his
own
words,
may
come
and
buy
time
on
the
nation's
most
power
communications
medium,
and
when
--
when
editorial
speakers
be
they
political
parties
or
voluntary
groups
like
bem
or
civil
rights
organizations
as
in
the
case
of
new
york
times
against
sullivan
wished
to
pay
same
rate,
to
buy
the
same
time,
to
address
what
they
regard
is
the
most
important
issues
of
the
day,
they
discriminatorily
refused
any
opportunity
to
purchase
that
time.
mr.
thomas
r.
asher
would
i
make
the
same
argument
with
respect
to
--
mr.
thomas
r.
asher
i
think
it
would
--
it
would
present
a
different
--
a
different
issue
mr.
justice
white
that
we
need
not
reach
in
this
case.
i
think
that
the
--
the
controlling
factor
would
be
state
action.
mr.
thomas
r.
asher
if
it
were
a
governmentally
owned
newspaper,
the
answer
is
yes,
we
would
make
that
argument.
if
on
the
other
hand
is
a
private
newspaper
--
mr.
thomas
r.
asher
it's
not
publicly
owned,
but
i
think
it
is
so
--
so
inundated
with
public
values.
it's
licensed
to
use
public
property.
i
would
--
i
would,
if
it's
possible,
i'd
like
to
defer
the
state
action
argument
for
a
moment,
but
if
you'd
prefer
i'll
address
it
now.
mr.
thomas
r.
asher
the
--
the
petitioners
seek
to
justify
the
exclusion
of
editorial
advertisements
on
two
distinct
grounds
and
i
think
this
should
be
kept
in
mind.
one
is
that
somehow
or
other
the
fairness
doctrine
offers
an
alternative
to
letting
people
speak,
and
therefore,
there's
no
real
--
real
first
amendment
interest
leftover
on
the
part
of
people
who
want
to
buy
advertising
time
to
say
what
they
wished
to
say.
the
fairness
doctrine
is
taking
care
of
all
that.
the
--
the
broadcaster
has
--
has
in
an
alternative
manner
told
the
public
all
that
it
needs
to
hear.
any
individual
who
wishes
to
speak
can
rest
assured
that
if
a
speech
was
worthwhile,
it
would
have
been
communicated
by
the
broadcaster
already.
the
second
is
a
parade
of
what
--
of
--
of
horrors
which
we
regard
as
purely
speculative
and
totally
undocumented
on
the
record
in
this
case.
now,
to
--
to
address
the
first
question,
whether
or
not
the
fairness
doctrine
constitutes
a
substitute
for
or
justification
for
excluding
constitutionally
protected
speech
from
the
marketplace
of
advertising.
and
--
and
i
perhaps
ought
to
digress
for
a
moment
to
--
to
indicate
that
the
court
below
limited
its
holding
to
that
time
which
a
broadcaster
voluntarily
elects
market
to
others.
the
court
characterized
that
as
advertising
time.
so,
when
a
broadcaster
voluntarily
elects
the
market
time
as
to
that
time
that
it
cannot
invidiously
discriminate
between
controversial
speech
and
others.
mr.
thomas
r.
asher
well,
perhaps
i
--
since
justice
white
and
yourself
both
--
both
expressed
interest
in
my
doing
it
sooner
i
--
i
would
address
it
at
this
moment.
if
i
can
refer
back
to
a
1966
opinion
written
by
the
chief
justice
when
he
sat
on
the
court
of
appeals
office
of
communication
of
united
church
of
christ,
the
fcc.
the
very
question
of
whether
or
not
a
broadcaster
can
be
equated
with
a
newspaper
in
terms
of
first
amendment
rights
was
--
the
question
raised
by
justice
stewart
earlier.
i
was
(inaudible)
--
mr.
thomas
r.
asher
yes
but
--
but
--
mr.
thomas
r.
asher
no
--
no
i
didn't
suggest
--
suggest
that
you
did
mr.
justice
stewart,
only
--
only
that
you
--
that
you
had
addressed
the
question
of
--
of
--
mr.
thomas
r.
asher
oh
at
least
there
--
an
analogy
here
between
the
newspapers
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
thomas
r.
asher
--
and
the
broadcasters
have
quite
clearly
suggested
that
there
is
an
analogy.
and
--
i
--
i
will
not
burden
the
court
with
--
with
all
of
the
analysis
that
--
that
mr.
justice
burger
went
through,
chief
--
chief
justice
burger
went
through
in
church
of
christ
case
except
to
--
to
point
out
that
it
was
clearly
rejected
that
there's
any
analogy
between
the
freedom
of
a
--
of
a
broadcaster
to
--
to
make
arbitrary
decisions
and
that
--
and
that
of
--
of
the
newspaper
which
in
church
of
christ
case,
it
was
characterized
as
a
purely
private
enterprise.
mr.
thomas
r.
asher
pardon
me?
mr.
thomas
r.
asher
yes.
the
newspaper
was
characterized
--
mr.
thomas
r.
asher
that's
right.
and
--
and
emphasizing
the
--
the
difference
between
broadcasters
and
newspapers,
mr.
chief
justice,
you
--
you
use
the
following
language,
“a
broadcaster
seeks
and
is
granted
the
free
and
exclusive
use
of
a
limited
and
valuable
part
of
the
public
domain.
when
he
accepts
that
franchise,
it
is
burdened
by
enforceable
public
interest
obligations.
a
newspaper
can
be
operated
at
the
whim
or
caprice
of
its
owners.
a
broadcast
station
cannot.”
now,
in
essence
we're
--
we're
addressed
but
here,
is
whether
or
not,
at
the
whim
or
caprice
of
a
--
of
a
broadcaster,
it
can
market
its
advertising
time
so
as
to
draw
what
we
would
think
is
--
has
been
clearly
established
by
this
court.
last
term
in
mosley
is
the
most
recent
example
as
invidiously
discriminatory
policy.
but
somehow
or
other
the
controversiality
of
the
speech
would
someone
wishes
to
utter
in
time
when
he
seeks
to
buy,
the
term
is
whether
or
not
he
can
utter
it.
and
in
fact,
if
it's
controversial
he
cannot
purchase
the
time,
he
is
flatly
banned.
if
it
is
not
controversial
and
therefore
not
protected
by
the
first
--
by
the
first
amendment,
then
he
can.
mr.
thomas
r.
asher
i
think
that
that's
--
that
maybe
quite
right
mr.
chief
justice,
but
what
the
commission
has
established
in
this
case
is
a
policy
that
when
a
broadcaster's
license
comes
--
renewal
comes
up,
and
every
three
years,
each
broadcaster's
license
comes
up.
that
--
that
whether
or
not
they
engage
in
this
invidious
discrimination,
notably
whether
or
not
they
employ
a
flat
ban.
this
will
not
be
regarded
as
a
negative
factor
on
--
on
the
side
of
--
of
determining
whether
they
have
served
the
public
interest.
in
fact,
the
democratic
national
committee
asked
for
alternative
relief
from
the
commission
to
ask,
one,
the
flat
bans
be
prohibited
or
--
or
two
alternatively,
that
the
commission
declare
that
it
will
be
regarded
as
a
negative
aspect
in
terms
of
--
of
serving
the
public
interest.
at
renewal
time
that
the
broadcasters
do
discriminate
against
controversial
speech
in
the
sale
of
their
advertising
time.
the
commission
rejected
both
of
those
approaches.so
what
the
commission
in
essence
has
done
here
is
it's
given
the
broadcasters
carte
blanche
to
employ
a
discriminatory
policy.
and
when
a
broadcaster
comes
up
for
renewal,
this
policy
will
not
be
held
against
him.
in
fact,
in
--
in
the
--
in
the
pleadings
in
the
bem
case,
wtop
specifically
stated
that
--
excuse
me
--
that
--
that
it
was
employing
a
policy
that
have
been
approved
by
the
government.
now,
this
approval
goes
to
the
very
core
of
whether
or
not
its
license
is
going
to
be
renewed.
and
it
makes
no
difference
whether
--
whether
the
--
the
commission
in
a
specific
proceeding
such
as
bem's
complaint
or
in
a
general
request
for
declaratory
ruling
as
in
the
case
of
democratic
national
committee
states
that
a
particular
discriminatory
policy
will
be
regarded
as
an
adverse
factoring
in
license
renewal.
the
question
is,
“has
--
what
has
the
commission
done
here?”
it
is
said,
“we
will
not
regard
this
as
an
adverse
factor.
we
regard
this
as
at
best
a
totally
neutral
factor.
you're
free
to
go
on
discriminating
and
your
licenses
will
be
renewed
as
usual.”
mr.
thomas
r.
asher
not
--
not
on
the
fact
of
this
case
mr.
rehnquist.
the
first
amendment
right
i
think
is
a
sort
of
obstruction
that
we
all
walk
around
guard
with
and
the
question
is,
“where
can
we
exercise
it
and
under
what
terms
can
it
be
denied?”
the
facts
here
were
rather
narrower
ones
and
the
court
below
made
it
--
rather
narrow
ruling.
so
when
a
broadcaster
holds
forth
time
for
sale,
then
within
that
time
it
cannot
discriminate
invidiously
between
controversial
and
commercial
speech.
that
is
the
sole
ruling
that
we're
seeking
affirmance
on
here.
and
--
and
the
facts
of
this
case
need
not
get
beyond
that
nobody
--
the
question
of
--
of
a
broadcaster
which
is
a
noncommercial
broadcaster,
which
is
not
hold
out
time
for
sale
and
thereby
make
a
discrimination
with
in
that
time.
some
--
some
mention
was
made
of
the
moose
lodge
case
and
--
and
that
somehow
or
other
it's
dispositive
of
the
--
of
the
facts
before
the
court
here.
of
course,
moose
lodge
involved
a
private
club
which
--
which
have
been
licensed
by
the
state
to
sell
liquor.
here,
we're
talking
about
what
has
been
time
and
again
characterized
as
a
publicly
engaged
industry
licensed
to
exercise
control
over
what
is
perhaps
the
most
important
form
of
communications
in
the
country.
but
there's
no
constitutional
value
protected
in
terms
of
person's
right
to
drink.
and
the
regulation
in
the
liquor
area
was
focused
primarily
upon
keeping
drunks
and
minors
out
of
--
out
of
bars.
a
legitimate
state
interest
but
clearly
no
way
relevant
to
--
to
determining
whether
or
not
when
the
government
owns
the
airwaves,
owns
the
--
the
form
of
communication
as
it
did
in
burton
against
wilmington
parking
authority.
and
on
top
of
it,
licenses
it
out
to
others
to
utilize
whether
or
not
at
least
for
--
for
the
purposes
of
applying
the
first
amendment
to
the
way
in
which
the
--
those
airwaves
are
allocated.
there's
not
sufficient
action
to
call
a
state
interest
or
state
act
must
--
not
sufficient
interest
to
call
a
state
action.
and
if
one
compares
the
analysis
engaged
by
this
court
in
moose
lodge
where
--
where
one
was
not
concerned
with
the
vital
first
amended
values
with
--
with
lloyd
against
tanner
where
there
was
no
licensing
whatever.
it
was
--
it
was
a
privately
owned
shopping
center
which
was
not
licensed
by
the
state.
yet,
nonetheless
the
court
--
the
court's
majority
felt
obliged
to
go
to
great
lengths
to
point
out
the
first
amendment
values
are
so
important,
that
reaching
that
--
that
shopping
center's
clientele
as
an
audience
are
so
important
that
there
are
alternative
ways
of
reaching
that
audience
without
getting
inside
the
shopping
center,
notably
distributing
the
leaflets
relief
at
the
entrance
ways.
now,
whether
one
agrees
or
not
with
--
with
the
result
reached
in
lloyd,
what
i
think
lloyd
demonstrates
that
when
--
when
dealing
with
first
amendment
values,
in
--
in
a
form
that
maybe
appropriate
for
the
communication
of
speech,
this
court
goes
to
great
lengths
to
try
and
determine
whether
or
not
speech
is
being
unduly
curtailed.
here
we're
dealing
with
a
form
unlike
in
lloyd
which
is
dedicated
solely
and
exclusively
for
the
purposes
of
communication.
it
has
no
--
no
purpose
or
whatever
--
whatever
other
than
communicating
information.
mr.
thomas
r.
asher
no.
i
think
--
i
--
well
i
would
--
i
would
like
perhaps
to
--
to
address
the
court's
attention
to
page
72
of
our
brief.
we
set
out
the
language
of
section
301
which
may
--
perhaps
be
a
good
place
to
start
analyzing
the
question
of
the
degree
of
governmental
involvement
in
the
operation
of
the
broadcasters.
it
is
the
purpose
of
this
act
to
maintain
the
control
of
the
united
states
over
all
the
channels
of
interstate
and
foreign
radio
transmission
and
to
provide
for
the
use
of
such
channels
but
not
the
ownership
thereof
by
persons
for
limited
periods
of
time
under
licenses
granted
by
the
federal
authority.
and
no
such
license
shall
be
construed
to
create
any
right
beyond
the
terms,
conditions,
and
periods
of
the
license.
now,
starting
from
that
preposition,
we
are
dealing
with
a
--
with
a
valuable
public
resource
that
the
government
has
maintained
very,
very
stringent
ownership
of
and
the
statute
requires
that
it
maintain
control
over.
this
differs
from
--
from
virtually
every
other
state
action
case
they
were
--
that
--
that
this
court
has
ever
been
approached
with
including
in
fact
burton
against
wilmington
parking
authority
where
there
was
no
specific
statutory
requirement
that
the
parking
authority
maintained
control
over
each
and
every
square
foot
of
the
parking
lot
they
have
built.
time
and
again,
this
court
when
faced
with
--
with
the
question
of
the
way
in
which
the
government
regulates
broadcasting
has
--
has
expressed
in
--
in
the
broadest
of
possible
terms
that
the
manner
in
which
the
government
exercises
this
--
this
control.
for
example,
in
pottsville
broadcasting
which
was
quoted
and
red
lion,
this
court
used
the
term
but
the
government
maintains
a
grip
on
the
dynamic
aspects
of
radio
transmission.
and
again,
in
red
lion,
this
court
stated
that
--
that
broadcasters
have
been
giving
a
preferred
position
--
preferred
position
conferred
by
government.
we
figured
we
--
we
--
when
we
blend
all
of
these
factors
together.
i
think
it
was
extremely
difficult
not
to
find
at
the
very
least.
that
the
way
in
which
broadcasters
operate
in
terms
of
allocating
their
--
their
airtime.
and
--
and
when
we're
talking
here
about
how
it
voluntarily
made
a
decision
to
--
to
market
their
airtime
must
be
held
up
to
governmental
standards.
the
same
first
amendment
standards
that
would
be
applied
if
the
government
were
operating
these
--
these
stations
themselves.
we're
not
talking
now
about
that
portion
of
the
broadcaster's
time
which
he
is
not
holding
out
to
others.
mr.
thomas
r.
asher
i
--
i
think
--
i
think
you
can
make
--
you
can
make
the
distinction,
mr.
justice
rehnquist
only
--
only
as
follows,
well,
the
fairness
doctrine
sweeps
across
the
entire
board
of
--
of
the
--
of
broadcasters
dealing
with
controversial
issues.
and
so,
presumably,
the
government
has
asserted
an
interest
in
--
in
the
whole
manner
in
which
it's
done.
from
our
point
of
view,
the
right
that
we're
asserting
is
not
an
absolute
right
to
all
of
the
broadcaster's
airtime.
it
simply
a
right
not
to
be
discriminated
against
when
the
broadcaster
elects
to
sell
some
of
it.
it'll
be
a
different
case
if
it
ever
comes
up
when
someone
asserts
a
right
to
broadcaster's
time
that
the
--
that
the
broadcaster
is
not
determine
he's
going
to
market
to
others.
mr.
thomas
r.
asher
well,
yes,
i
think
--
i
think
so.so
certainly
if
in
--
if
in
a
broadcast
station's
offices
an
employee
tripped
and
--
and
would
hurt
himself,
he
wouldn't
have
to
assert
his
rights
under
the
federal
tort
claims
act.
notably,
the
distinction
is
that
--
that
the
airwaves
or
where
their
licensed
out
by
the
government
and
it's
the
utilization
of
those
airwaves
which
--
which
bring
--
bring
the
broadcaster
within
the
ambit
of
state
action
or
aspects
of
--
of
a
broadcaster
operations
be
the
employee
practices
or
otherwise
would
be
judged
on
different
grounds.
but
again,
the
--
the
focus
here
is
primarily
upon
--
upon
the
utilization
of
airtime,
the
allocation
of
airtime.
mr.
thomas
r.
asher
well,
i
--
i
--
limitation
and
censorship
may
perhaps
be
the
same
mr.
justice
stewart.
all
--
all
that
we
are
asserting
here
is
that
--
certainly,
no
one
has
an
absolute
right
to
speak
on
the
airwaves
and
nbc
case
made
this
clear.
what
we're
saying
is
that
--
that
the
broadcaster
has
not
got
a
right
to
be
unreasonable.
mr.
thomas
r.
asher
that's
right.
mr.
thomas
r.
asher
that's
right
and
i
think
the
--
mr.
thomas
r.
asher
oh,
right,
and
i
am
trying
to
make
my
argument
accord
with
that.
i
think
that
in
--
in
stressing
the
element
of
discrimination
rather
than
the
element
of
absolute
rights,
we're
focusing
on
whether
or
not
there
has
been
an
invidious
discrimination
which
i
get
in
--
in
deciding
mostly
last
term,
this
court
acknowledged
that
the
first
amendment
interest
and
equal
protection
interest
were
intertwined,
but
nonetheless
came
down
on
--
on
equal
protection
grounds.
i
think
what
we
find
ourselves
faced
with
here
is
largely
the
same
--
the
same
factor.
the
government
can
limit
speech.
it
limits
speech
all
the
time.
the
question
is,
“is
it
doing
on
a
reasonable
basis?”
and
--
and
that
i
believe
to
be
the
--
the
fundamental
question
here.
mr.
thomas
r.
asher
oh
i
think
--
i
think
there's
no
doubt
about
it.
it
--
it
closes
this
courtroom
at
a
certain
time
and
only
allows
certain
to
speak
in
the
courtroom.
mr.
thomas
r.
asher
(inaudible)
time,
place,
and
manner
are
perfectly
permissible
while
one
may
have
a
right
to
speak
in
--
in
the
capital
building
during
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
thomas
r.
asher
certainly
not
--
mr.
thomas
r.
asher
certainly
not
on
the
basis
of
the
content
and
if
on
a
content
at
all,
certainly
not
on
the
basis
of
the
fact
that
controversial
speech
will
be
excluded.
mr.
thomas
r.
asher
it's
--
it's
a
--
it's
a
very,
very
difficult
distinction
to
make
mr.
justice
stewart
and
--
and
certainly
this
court
has
--
has
many
--
many
cases
suggested
that
the
--
that
regardless
of
whether
or
not
one
is
--
what
is
responsible.
one
has
--
has
a
right
to
speak,
that
may
--
the
answer
to
the
question
is,
“if
--
if
a
form
is
unlimited,
then
--
then
probably
you
cannot
distinguish
on
the
grounds
if
--
if
this
man
irresponsible
and
that
man
is
responsible.”
however,
if
the
form
is
limited,
it
may
be
a
reasonable
ground
to
suggest
that
one
man
is
speaking
for
a
broader
audience
than
another.
we
--
we
constantly
face
allocated
problems
when
--
when
two
people
want
a
parade
permit
to
go
on
the
same
street
at
the
same
time,
the
government
has
to
make
an
allocative
decision
and
there
are
numerous
reasonable
grounds
in
which
you
could
do
it.
now,
responsibility
maybe
one
of
them,
although
i
find
it
the
most
troublesome
simply
because
it's
the
kind
of
judgment
that
--
that
is
most
attacked
with
censorship.
mr.
thomas
r.
asher
well,
this
court
has
certainly
suggested
that
in
terms
of
--
in
--
in
cases
such
as
valentine
and
breard.
mr.
thomas
r.
asher
yes,
but
it's
an
inverse
classification.
mr.
thomas
r.
asher
instead
of
--
instead
of
saying
--
mr.
thomas
r.
asher
i
think
we
do.
but
i
think
--
i
think
that
--
that
the
classification
is
unreasonable
and
impermissible
on
its
face,
unless
this
court
is
prepared
to
state
that
somehow
or
rather
it's
permissible
for
--
for
a
governmentally
operated
form
to
say,
“commercial
speech
would
be
permitted
and
--
and
political
speech
will
not.”
and
every
single
time
this
court
has
been
addressed
with
that
question.it
is
answered
--
it
is
answered
in
the
negative
--
mr.
thomas
r.
asher
oh
we
have
numerous
classifications
but
--
that
we
will
allow
political
speech
by
political
parties
to
raise
money,
we
won't
allow
it
for
other
purposes,
which
--
which
in
a
way
touch
--
touches
upon
another
unreasonable
aspect
of
--
of
the
entire
scheme
that
seems
to
be
evolving
here.
notably,
we
start
out
with
--
with
what
we
--
what
presumably
would
be
a
neutral
approach
to
--
to
marketing
advertising
time
and
immediately,
the
neutrality
is
removed
by
saying,
“controversial
speech
is
going
to
be
let
out.”
it's
going
to
be
excluded.
so
the
--
we
slip
from
neutrality
of
time,
place,
and
manner
at
least
as
--
which
has
been
held
permissible
in
--
in
numerous
cases
into
an
unneutral
area
which
--
which
is
invidious.
it
--
it
excludes
political
speech
and
permits
commercial
speech,
free
roam,
free
reign
within
that
airtime.
and
if
not
free
reign
of
some
controls
or
exercise,
at
least
an
opportunity
to
speak
and
that's
all
that
we
seek
here
and
nothing
more.
mr.
thomas
r.
asher
well,
we've
been
--
we've
been
hard-pressed
to
try
to
find
any
--
any
of
the
interest
that
have
been
--
been
asserted
by
the
broadcasters
that
--
that
can
be
regarded
as
overwhelming.
one
--
one
is
the
danger
that
perhaps
the
rich
will
--
will
buy
up
the
time
and
somehow
set
the
agenda
of
debate.
mr.
thomas
r.
asher
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
thomas
r.
asher
the
broadcasters
regulating
their
own
time?
mr.
thomas
r.
asher
that's
right.
mr.
thomas
r.
asher
and
--
and
no
--
no
one
is
questioning
the
broadcasters'
right
to
regulate
it
in
term
of
saying,
“we're
going
to
market
so
much
to
sell
to
others.
we're
going
to
keep
so
much
for
ourselves
to
say
what
we
want
to.”
were
just
talking
about
that
time
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
thomas
r.
asher
that's
right.
that's
the
only
ground
on
which
we
were
kept
out.
if
you
look
at
the
policy
that
was
--
of
--
of
wtop
radio
station
on
which
the
business
executive
group
was
excluded,
the
only
ground
on
which
it
was
excluded
was
the
controversiality
of
its
message.
no
other
ground
or
whatever
and
strictly
that
narrow
discrimination
that
we're
talking
about.
that
number
of
--
of
what
i
would
regard
as
false
horrors
have
been
paraded
to
the
court
as
to
what
might
happen
if
it
were
acknowledged
that
there
is
no
right
not
to
discriminate.
no.
i'm
sorry,
no
right
to
discriminate
or
a
right
to
be
required
not
to
discriminate.
one
--
somehow
or
other
that
the
rich
might
buy
up
all
the
time,
i
think
that
that's
the
best
speculative
danger
of
--
because
we
--
if
--
if
we
look
at
the
nature
of
--
of
editorial
advertising
in
the
newspapers,
we
find
it
for
the
most
part,
editorial
advertising
is
utilized
by
disadvantaged
groups
that
somehow
or
other
feel
their
views
have
already
been
excluded.
the
--
the
rich
on
the
other
hand
are
not
monolithic
by
any
means
and
if
general
motors
in
fact,
decided
that
rather
than
--
than
trying
to
sell
cars
it
was
going
to
use
all
the
time
it
could
buy
up
to
talk
about
political
issues.one
that
would
run
completely
counter
to
the
situation
we
see
in
--
in
the
newspaper
area
where
we
find
very
little
politicizing
by
--
by
commercial
interest.
secondly,
that
--
that
subject
wasn't
briefed
to
this
court.
but
thirdly,
even
if
it
were
done,
even
if
--
if
corporations
utilized
advertising
time
to
address
issues
rather
to
simply
demerits
of
products
is
that
necessarily
and
undesirable
first
amendment
consequent
so
long
as
we
have
the
fairness
doctrine
to
assure
that
there
is
balance.
now,
another
one
of
the
dangers
that's
been
advanced
is
that
somehow
or
other
the
fairness
doctrine
will
be
wrecked
if
we
have
it
--
have
a
--
a
requirement
that
editorial
speech
not
be
excluded
from
advertising
time.
and
again,
there's
no
basis
or
whatever
for
reaching
this
conclusion.
numerous
stations
is
acknowledged
by
the
broadcasters
already
carried
editorial
advertisements.
none
of
them
have
come
forward
to
say
that
somehow
or
other
as
a
result
of
our
doing
this
we're
about
to
go
under,
we're
being
swamped.
the
cullman
doctrine
which
requires
that
broadcasters
give
free
time
for
response
only
comes
about
in
two
circumstances.one,
where
a
controversial
--
or
three
circumstances
--
controversial
issue
of
public
important
isn't
--
has
not
been
dealt
with
fairly
by
the
broadcaster,
where
there's
an
imbalance
in
the
broadcasters'
program.
and
one
of
the
cigarette
cases
that
the
fcc
has
held
an
8-to-1
balance
of
pro
cigarette
to
anti
cigarette
advertisements
is
reasonable.
so
the
broadcasters
have
tremendous
latitude
in
which
to
determine
what
is
balanced.
secondly,
no
one
is
paid
to
come
forward
to
put
on
the
other
side.
and
thirdly,
the
broadcaster
in
his
own
programming
is
not
in
one
way
or
another
elected
to
present
the
other
side
only
in
those
circumstances,
must
they
give
time
free
to
someone
to
present
an
alternative
view
point?
now,
remember,
we're
--
we're
not
talking
about
every
issue
in
the
world,
we're
talking
about
issues
that
are
both
controversial
and
of
public
importance.
notably,
those
issues
which
not
only
the
fairness
doctrine
applies
to
but
--
but
are
specifically
excluded
under
the
flat
ban
policy
that
we
asked
to
this
court
to
declare
unconstitutional.
now,
if
an
issue
is
both
controversial
and
of
public
importance,
presumably
a
broadcaster
if
he's
fulfilling
his
fairness
doctrine
obligation
is
already
going
to
be
covered
--
covering
that
issue.
it's
very
unlikely
that
letting
on
a
particular
spokesman
is
going
to
throw
this
programming
into
imbalance
and
the
facts
of
the
bem
case
indicate
that.
wtop
has
argued
that
it
has
presented
both
sides
of
the
war
in
--
in
extreme
balance.
keeping
in
mind
the
eight
to
one
ratio
that
the
commission
has
held
to
be
reasonable
selling
three
or
four
minutes
to
one
group
or
another
group
to
express
their
views
on
the
issue
to
supplement
what
the
broadcasters
already
put
on
in
news
time.
he's
not
going
to
throw
his
programming
into
imbalance.
the
one
place
in
which
--
in
which
we
might
find
a
problem,
the
broadcaster
being
faced
with
either
an
economic
burden
under
the
fairness
doctrine
or
--
or
encourage
it
upon
his
discretion
as
to
what
issue
should
be
covered
is
where
a
new
issue
comes
up.
or
at
issue
that
the
broadcaster
for
one
reason
or
another,
even
though
its
controversial,
and
even
though
it's
a
public
importance,
a
broadcaster
is
elected
not
to
put
on
the
air.
and
some
member
of
the
public
feeling
that
it's
so
important
has
gone
forth
with
his
money
and
paid
the
money,
and
bought
time,
and
raised
that
issue,
then,
the
broadcaster
obviously
not
having
covered
it.
probably,
he's
not
been
fulfilling
his
fairness
doctrine
obligation.
he
may
have
overlooked
the
issue.
and
so,
in
furtherance
of
first
amendment
objective
of
what
--
of
robust
wide
open
debate,
a
new
issue
would
have
been
brought
to
public
attention,
and
how
the
broadcaster
deals
with
it
need
not
impose
any
great
economic
burden.
primarily,
the
broadcaster
will
deal
with
that
issue
by
either
dealing
with
the
news
time;
perhaps
another
member
of
the
public
will
come
forward
and
buy
time
to
present
--
present
the
other
side.
but
in
any
event,
the
broadcaster
is
going
to
be
subjected
to
no
burden
that
he
--
he's
not
--
he's
not
already
required
to
address
under
--
under
the
fairness
doctrine
because
we're
only
talking
about
controversial
issues
and
public
importance.
we're
not
talking
about
those
kinds
of
issues
which
the
broadcaster
somehow
or
other
suggest
they
should
--
they
should
exclude.
one
of
the
broadcasters
suggest
that
trivial
issues
might
be
excludable.well
it's
trivial
but
it's
not
controversial
and
of
public
importance.
we're
only
talking
about
the
burning
issues
of
the
day,
those
very
issues
that
the
broadcaster
must
address
in
his
programming
time
under
the
fairness
doctrine
and
must
address
with
balance.
i
think
that
--
that
i've
--
i've
covered
pretty
much
those
areas
that
--
that
were
not
covered
by
mr.
califano.
except
to
suggest
that
--
that
the
question
of
programming
time
as
far
as
we're
concerned
in
the
context
of
this
case,
must
be
looked
at
very
narrowly.
notably,
if
a
broadcaster
regularly
markets
programming
time
to
others,
then
again,
it
would
be
invidious
to
say,
“i'll
market
it
to
you
if
you
want
to
talk
about
a
commercial
subject
but
not
about
a
controversial
one.”
on
the
other
hand,
if
a
broadcaster
markets
only
spot
advertising
time,
which
is
--
which
is
the
case
in
--
with
the
number
of
broadcasters
then
that's
what
we're
talking
about.
and
we're
saying,
“that's
what
he
can't
discriminate.”
but
nonetheless,
the
basic
question
is
discrimination
and
basic
judgment
is
the
broadcasters
as
to
what
he
is
going
to
subject
to
--
what
--
what
type
of
time
he
is
going
to
put
up
for
sale.
when
he
puts
time
up
for
sale,
then
he
is
to
be
held
the
requirement
that
he
need
--
that
he
not
discriminate
invidiously
between
that
which
is
controversial
and
that
which
is
not.
thank
you.
mr.
thomas
r.
asher
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
because
i
--
i
feel
that
perhaps
the
argument
has
--
has
taken
a
path
of
obstruction,
i
would
beg,
leave
to
try
to
focus
upon
the
specific
facts
present
in
the
bem
case
to
illustrate
the
exact
nature
of
the
issue
before
the
court.
the
narrowness
of
that
issue
has
held
by
the
court
below.
the
issue
is
one
of
discrimination,
broadcasters
voluntarily
determine
that
in
order
raise
revenue,
they're
going
to
put
a
certain
portion
of
their
airtime
up
for
sale
and
market
it
to
others.
and
if
those
other
persons
are
going
to
use
that
time
to
speak.
bem
approaches
--
approached
the
broadcaster
that
did
just
that
with
18
out
of
every
60
minutes
is
on
the
air,
wtop
radio
station
sought
to
purchase
time.
it
was
turned
down,
not
for
any
of
the
reasons
suggested
by
the
petitioners,
not
because
the
speech
was
obscene,
indecent,
defamatory
or
might
somehow
otherwise
be
in
violation
of
some
specific
law.
but
solely
and
exclusively
on
the
basis
of
a
policy
which
is
set
out
at
page
297
of
the
appendix.
i
quote,
“it
is
the
policy
of
post-newsweek
stations,
radio
and
television
stations
not
to
sell
spot
announcement
time
to
individuals
or
groups
in
order
to
set
forth
a
point
of
view
on
any
controversial
subject
of
pubic
importance.
and
that
presents
the
clear,
narrow
issue
that
was
decided
by
the
court
below.
that's
a
flat
ban
on
selling
time
which
is
regularly
marketed
to
commercial
spokesman
to
people
who
wish
to
speak
about
controversial
subjects.
in
brief,
such
a
policy
as
we
view
the
--
the
ruling
of
the
court
below
and
as
this
case
is
presented
involves
no
question
of
creating
a
new
constitutional
right
--
of
right
of
access
as
--
as
it's
phrased.
rather,
it
deals
specifically
with
a
question
of
whether
or
not
assuming
for
the
moment,
i
will
address
state
action.
assuming
that
the
action
of
the
broadcaster
is
either
itself
state
action
or
because
of
firm
and
approved
by
the
regulatory
agency
state
action,
whether
or
not
this
discrimination,
barring
for
first
amendment
protected
speech,
in
and
of
itself,
is
violative
of
the
first
amendment.
it
doesn't
mean
that
every
person
has
a
right
to
speak,
but
rather
a
right
not
to
be
excluded
on
such
a
discriminatory
ground.
we
would
suggest
primarily
that
--
that
reading
cases
like
valentine
against
chrestensen,
and
breard
versus
alexandria,
the
--
the
approach
taken
by
the
broadcasters
in
terms
of
their
marketing
of
time
turns
constitutional
values
on
their
head
because
this
court
has
time
and
again
in
those
cases
held
that
the
first
amendment
protects
political
speech.
it
does
not
protect
commercial
speech.
it
somehow
rather
the
commercial
speaker
when
he
wishes
to
--
to
address
particular
issue
or
the
merits
of
his
product
or
otherwise
in
his
own
words,
may
come
and
buy
time
on
the
nation's
most
power
communications
medium,
and
when
--
when
editorial
speakers
be
they
political
parties
or
voluntary
groups
like
bem
or
civil
rights
organizations
as
in
the
case
of
new
york
times
against
sullivan
wished
to
pay
same
rate,
to
buy
the
same
time,
to
address
what
they
regard
is
the
most
important
issues
of
the
day,
they
discriminatorily
refused
any
opportunity
to
purchase
that
time.
mr.
thomas
r.
asher
would
i
make
the
same
argument
with
respect
to
--
mr.
thomas
r.
asher
i
think
it
would
--
it
would
present
a
different
--
a
different
issue
mr.
justice
white
that
we
need
not
reach
in
this
case.
i
think
that
the
--
the
controlling
factor
would
be
state
action.
mr.
thomas
r.
asher
if
it
were
a
governmentally
owned
newspaper,
the
answer
is
yes,
we
would
make
that
argument.
if
on
the
other
hand
is
a
private
newspaper
--
mr.
thomas
r.
asher
it's
not
publicly
owned,
but
i
think
it
is
so
--
so
inundated
with
public
values.
it's
licensed
to
use
public
property.
i
would
--
i
would,
if
it's
possible,
i'd
like
to
defer
the
state
action
argument
for
a
moment,
but
if
you'd
prefer
i'll
address
it
now.
mr.
thomas
r.
asher
the
--
the
petitioners
seek
to
justify
the
exclusion
of
editorial
advertisements
on
two
distinct
grounds
and
i
think
this
should
be
kept
in
mind.
one
is
that
somehow
or
other
the
fairness
doctrine
offers
an
alternative
to
letting
people
speak,
and
therefore,
there's
no
real
--
real
first
amendment
interest
leftover
on
the
part
of
people
who
want
to
buy
advertising
time
to
say
what
they
wished
to
say.
the
fairness
doctrine
is
taking
care
of
all
that.
the
--
the
broadcaster
has
--
has
in
an
alternative
manner
told
the
public
all
that
it
needs
to
hear.
any
individual
who
wishes
to
speak
can
rest
assured
that
if
a
speech
was
worthwhile,
it
would
have
been
communicated
by
the
broadcaster
already.
the
second
is
a
parade
of
what
--
of
--
of
horrors
which
we
regard
as
purely
speculative
and
totally
undocumented
on
the
record
in
this
case.
now,
to
--
to
address
the
first
question,
whether
or
not
the
fairness
doctrine
constitutes
a
substitute
for
or
justification
for
excluding
constitutionally
protected
speech
from
the
marketplace
of
advertising.
and
--
and
i
perhaps
ought
to
digress
for
a
moment
to
--
to
indicate
that
the
court
below
limited
its
holding
to
that
time
which
a
broadcaster
voluntarily
elects
market
to
others.
the
court
characterized
that
as
advertising
time.
so,
when
a
broadcaster
voluntarily
elects
the
market
time
as
to
that
time
that
it
cannot
invidiously
discriminate
between
controversial
speech
and
others.
mr.
thomas
r.
asher
well,
perhaps
i
--
since
justice
white
and
yourself
both
--
both
expressed
interest
in
my
doing
it
sooner
i
--
i
would
address
it
at
this
moment.
if
i
can
refer
back
to
a
1966
opinion
written
by
the
chief
justice
when
he
sat
on
the
court
of
appeals
office
of
communication
of
united
church
of
christ,
the
fcc.
the
very
question
of
whether
or
not
a
broadcaster
can
be
equated
with
a
newspaper
in
terms
of
first
amendment
rights
was
--
the
question
raised
by
justice
stewart
earlier.
i
was
(inaudible)
--
mr.
thomas
r.
asher
yes
but
--
but
--
mr.
thomas
r.
asher
no
--
no
i
didn't
suggest
--
suggest
that
you
did
mr.
justice
stewart,
only
--
only
that
you
--
that
you
had
addressed
the
question
of
--
of
--
mr.
thomas
r.
asher
oh
at
least
there
--
an
analogy
here
between
the
newspapers
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
thomas
r.
asher
--
and
the
broadcasters
have
quite
clearly
suggested
that
there
is
an
analogy.
and
--
i
--
i
will
not
burden
the
court
with
--
with
all
of
the
analysis
that
--
that
mr.
justice
burger
went
through,
chief
--
chief
justice
burger
went
through
in
church
of
christ
case
except
to
--
to
point
out
that
it
was
clearly
rejected
that
there's
any
analogy
between
the
freedom
of
a
--
of
a
broadcaster
to
--
to
make
arbitrary
decisions
and
that
--
and
that
of
--
of
the
newspaper
which
in
church
of
christ
case,
it
was
characterized
as
a
purely
private
enterprise.
mr.
thomas
r.
asher
pardon
me?
mr.
thomas
r.
asher
yes.
the
newspaper
was
characterized
--
mr.
thomas
r.
asher
that's
right.
and
--
and
emphasizing
the
--
the
difference
between
broadcasters
and
newspapers,
mr.
chief
justice,
you
--
you
use
the
following
language,
“a
broadcaster
seeks
and
is
granted
the
free
and
exclusive
use
of
a
limited
and
valuable
part
of
the
public
domain.
when
he
accepts
that
franchise,
it
is
burdened
by
enforceable
public
interest
obligations.
a
newspaper
can
be
operated
at
the
whim
or
caprice
of
its
owners.
a
broadcast
station
cannot.”
now,
in
essence
we're
--
we're
addressed
but
here,
is
whether
or
not,
at
the
whim
or
caprice
of
a
--
of
a
broadcaster,
it
can
market
its
advertising
time
so
as
to
draw
what
we
would
think
is
--
has
been
clearly
established
by
this
court.
last
term
in
mosley
is
the
most
recent
example
as
invidiously
discriminatory
policy.
but
somehow
or
other
the
controversiality
of
the
speech
would
someone
wishes
to
utter
in
time
when
he
seeks
to
buy,
the
term
is
whether
or
not
he
can
utter
it.
and
in
fact,
if
it's
controversial
he
cannot
purchase
the
time,
he
is
flatly
banned.
if
it
is
not
controversial
and
therefore
not
protected
by
the
first
--
by
the
first
amendment,
then
he
can.
mr.
thomas
r.
asher
i
think
that
that's
--
that
maybe
quite
right
mr.
chief
justice,
but
what
the
commission
has
established
in
this
case
is
a
policy
that
when
a
broadcaster's
license
comes
--
renewal
comes
up,
and
every
three
years,
each
broadcaster's
license
comes
up.
that
--
that
whether
or
not
they
engage
in
this
invidious
discrimination,
notably
whether
or
not
they
employ
a
flat
ban.
this
will
not
be
regarded
as
a
negative
factor
on
--
on
the
side
of
--
of
determining
whether
they
have
served
the
public
interest.
in
fact,
the
democratic
national
committee
asked
for
alternative
relief
from
the
commission
to
ask,
one,
the
flat
bans
be
prohibited
or
--
or
two
alternatively,
that
the
commission
declare
that
it
will
be
regarded
as
a
negative
aspect
in
terms
of
--
of
serving
the
public
interest.
at
renewal
time
that
the
broadcasters
do
discriminate
against
controversial
speech
in
the
sale
of
their
advertising
time.
the
commission
rejected
both
of
those
approaches.so
what
the
commission
in
essence
has
done
here
is
it's
given
the
broadcasters
carte
blanche
to
employ
a
discriminatory
policy.
and
when
a
broadcaster
comes
up
for
renewal,
this
policy
will
not
be
held
against
him.
in
fact,
in
--
in
the
--
in
the
pleadings
in
the
bem
case,
wtop
specifically
stated
that
--
excuse
me
--
that
--
that
it
was
employing
a
policy
that
have
been
approved
by
the
government.
now,
this
approval
goes
to
the
very
core
of
whether
or
not
its
license
is
going
to
be
renewed.
and
it
makes
no
difference
whether
--
whether
the
--
the
commission
in
a
specific
proceeding
such
as
bem's
complaint
or
in
a
general
request
for
declaratory
ruling
as
in
the
case
of
democratic
national
committee
states
that
a
particular
discriminatory
policy
will
be
regarded
as
an
adverse
factoring
in
license
renewal.
the
question
is,
“has
--
what
has
the
commission
done
here?”
it
is
said,
“we
will
not
regard
this
as
an
adverse
factor.
we
regard
this
as
at
best
a
totally
neutral
factor.
you're
free
to
go
on
discriminating
and
your
licenses
will
be
renewed
as
usual.”
mr.
thomas
r.
asher
not
--
not
on
the
fact
of
this
case
mr.
rehnquist.
the
first
amendment
right
i
think
is
a
sort
of
obstruction
that
we
all
walk
around
guard
with
and
the
question
is,
“where
can
we
exercise
it
and
under
what
terms
can
it
be
denied?”
the
facts
here
were
rather
narrower
ones
and
the
court
below
made
it
--
rather
narrow
ruling.
so
when
a
broadcaster
holds
forth
time
for
sale,
then
within
that
time
it
cannot
discriminate
invidiously
between
controversial
and
commercial
speech.
that
is
the
sole
ruling
that
we're
seeking
affirmance
on
here.
and
--
and
the
facts
of
this
case
need
not
get
beyond
that
nobody
--
the
question
of
--
of
a
broadcaster
which
is
a
noncommercial
broadcaster,
which
is
not
hold
out
time
for
sale
and
thereby
make
a
discrimination
with
in
that
time.
some
--
some
mention
was
made
of
the
moose
lodge
case
and
--
and
that
somehow
or
other
it's
dispositive
of
the
--
of
the
facts
before
the
court
here.
of
course,
moose
lodge
involved
a
private
club
which
--
which
have
been
licensed
by
the
state
to
sell
liquor.
here,
we're
talking
about
what
has
been
time
and
again
characterized
as
a
publicly
engaged
industry
licensed
to
exercise
control
over
what
is
perhaps
the
most
important
form
of
communications
in
the
country.
but
there's
no
constitutional
value
protected
in
terms
of
person's
right
to
drink.
and
the
regulation
in
the
liquor
area
was
focused
primarily
upon
keeping
drunks
and
minors
out
of
--
out
of
bars.
a
legitimate
state
interest
but
clearly
no
way
relevant
to
--
to
determining
whether
or
not
when
the
government
owns
the
airwaves,
owns
the
--
the
form
of
communication
as
it
did
in
burton
against
wilmington
parking
authority.
and
on
top
of
it,
licenses
it
out
to
others
to
utilize
whether
or
not
at
least
for
--
for
the
purposes
of
applying
the
first
amendment
to
the
way
in
which
the
--
those
airwaves
are
allocated.
there's
not
sufficient
action
to
call
a
state
interest
or
state
act
must
--
not
sufficient
interest
to
call
a
state
action.
and
if
one
compares
the
analysis
engaged
by
this
court
in
moose
lodge
where
--
where
one
was
not
concerned
with
the
vital
first
amended
values
with
--
with
lloyd
against
tanner
where
there
was
no
licensing
whatever.
it
was
--
it
was
a
privately
owned
shopping
center
which
was
not
licensed
by
the
state.
yet,
nonetheless
the
court
--
the
court's
majority
felt
obliged
to
go
to
great
lengths
to
point
out
the
first
amendment
values
are
so
important,
that
reaching
that
--
that
shopping
center's
clientele
as
an
audience
are
so
important
that
there
are
alternative
ways
of
reaching
that
audience
without
getting
inside
the
shopping
center,
notably
distributing
the
leaflets
relief
at
the
entrance
ways.
now,
whether
one
agrees
or
not
with
--
with
the
result
reached
in
lloyd,
what
i
think
lloyd
demonstrates
that
when
--
when
dealing
with
first
amendment
values,
in
--
in
a
form
that
maybe
appropriate
for
the
communication
of
speech,
this
court
goes
to
great
lengths
to
try
and
determine
whether
or
not
speech
is
being
unduly
curtailed.
here
we're
dealing
with
a
form
unlike
in
lloyd
which
is
dedicated
solely
and
exclusively
for
the
purposes
of
communication.
it
has
no
--
no
purpose
or
whatever
--
whatever
other
than
communicating
information.
mr.
thomas
r.
asher
no.
i
think
--
i
--
well
i
would
--
i
would
like
perhaps
to
--
to
address
the
court's
attention
to
page
72
of
our
brief.
we
set
out
the
language
of
section
301
which
may
--
perhaps
be
a
good
place
to
start
analyzing
the
question
of
the
degree
of
governmental
involvement
in
the
operation
of
the
broadcasters.
it
is
the
purpose
of
this
act
to
maintain
the
control
of
the
united
states
over
all
the
channels
of
interstate
and
foreign
radio
transmission
and
to
provide
for
the
use
of
such
channels
but
not
the
ownership
thereof
by
persons
for
limited
periods
of
time
under
licenses
granted
by
the
federal
authority.
and
no
such
license
shall
be
construed
to
create
any
right
beyond
the
terms,
conditions,
and
periods
of
the
license.
now,
starting
from
that
preposition,
we
are
dealing
with
a
--
with
a
valuable
public
resource
that
the
government
has
maintained
very,
very
stringent
ownership
of
and
the
statute
requires
that
it
maintain
control
over.
this
differs
from
--
from
virtually
every
other
state
action
case
they
were
--
that
--
that
this
court
has
ever
been
approached
with
including
in
fact
burton
against
wilmington
parking
authority
where
there
was
no
specific
statutory
requirement
that
the
parking
authority
maintained
control
over
each
and
every
square
foot
of
the
parking
lot
they
have
built.
time
and
again,
this
court
when
faced
with
--
with
the
question
of
the
way
in
which
the
government
regulates
broadcasting
has
--
has
expressed
in
--
in
the
broadest
of
possible
terms
that
the
manner
in
which
the
government
exercises
this
--
this
control.
for
example,
in
pottsville
broadcasting
which
was
quoted
and
red
lion,
this
court
used
the
term
but
the
government
maintains
a
grip
on
the
dynamic
aspects
of
radio
transmission.
and
again,
in
red
lion,
this
court
stated
that
--
that
broadcasters
have
been
giving
a
preferred
position
--
preferred
position
conferred
by
government.
we
figured
we
--
we
--
when
we
blend
all
of
these
factors
together.
i
think
it
was
extremely
difficult
not
to
find
at
the
very
least.
that
the
way
in
which
broadcasters
operate
in
terms
of
allocating
their
--
their
airtime.
and
--
and
when
we're
talking
here
about
how
it
voluntarily
made
a
decision
to
--
to
market
their
airtime
must
be
held
up
to
governmental
standards.
the
same
first
amendment
standards
that
would
be
applied
if
the
government
were
operating
these
--
these
stations
themselves.
we're
not
talking
now
about
that
portion
of
the
broadcaster's
time
which
he
is
not
holding
out
to
others.
mr.
thomas
r.
asher
i
--
i
think
--
i
think
you
can
make
--
you
can
make
the
distinction,
mr.
justice
rehnquist
only
--
only
as
follows,
well,
the
fairness
doctrine
sweeps
across
the
entire
board
of
--
of
the
--
of
broadcasters
dealing
with
controversial
issues.
and
so,
presumably,
the
government
has
asserted
an
interest
in
--
in
the
whole
manner
in
which
it's
done.
from
our
point
of
view,
the
right
that
we're
asserting
is
not
an
absolute
right
to
all
of
the
broadcaster's
airtime.
it
simply
a
right
not
to
be
discriminated
against
when
the
broadcaster
elects
to
sell
some
of
it.
it'll
be
a
different
case
if
it
ever
comes
up
when
someone
asserts
a
right
to
broadcaster's
time
that
the
--
that
the
broadcaster
is
not
determine
he's
going
to
market
to
others.
mr.
thomas
r.
asher
well,
yes,
i
think
--
i
think
so.so
certainly
if
in
--
if
in
a
broadcast
station's
offices
an
employee
tripped
and
--
and
would
hurt
himself,
he
wouldn't
have
to
assert
his
rights
under
the
federal
tort
claims
act.
notably,
the
distinction
is
that
--
that
the
airwaves
or
where
their
licensed
out
by
the
government
and
it's
the
utilization
of
those
airwaves
which
--
which
bring
--
bring
the
broadcaster
within
the
ambit
of
state
action
or
aspects
of
--
of
a
broadcaster
operations
be
the
employee
practices
or
otherwise
would
be
judged
on
different
grounds.
but
again,
the
--
the
focus
here
is
primarily
upon
--
upon
the
utilization
of
airtime,
the
allocation
of
airtime.
mr.
thomas
r.
asher
well,
i
--
i
--
limitation
and
censorship
may
perhaps
be
the
same
mr.
justice
stewart.
all
--
all
that
we
are
asserting
here
is
that
--
certainly,
no
one
has
an
absolute
right
to
speak
on
the
airwaves
and
nbc
case
made
this
clear.
what
we're
saying
is
that
--
that
the
broadcaster
has
not
got
a
right
to
be
unreasonable.
mr.
thomas
r.
asher
that's
right.
mr.
thomas
r.
asher
that's
right
and
i
think
the
--
mr.
thomas
r.
asher
oh,
right,
and
i
am
trying
to
make
my
argument
accord
with
that.
i
think
that
in
--
in
stressing
the
element
of
discrimination
rather
than
the
element
of
absolute
rights,
we're
focusing
on
whether
or
not
there
has
been
an
invidious
discrimination
which
i
get
in
--
in
deciding
mostly
last
term,
this
court
acknowledged
that
the
first
amendment
interest
and
equal
protection
interest
were
intertwined,
but
nonetheless
came
down
on
--
on
equal
protection
grounds.
i
think
what
we
find
ourselves
faced
with
here
is
largely
the
same
--
the
same
factor.
the
government
can
limit
speech.
it
limits
speech
all
the
time.
the
question
is,
“is
it
doing
on
a
reasonable
basis?”
and
--
and
that
i
believe
to
be
the
--
the
fundamental
question
here.
mr.
thomas
r.
asher
oh
i
think
--
i
think
there's
no
doubt
about
it.
it
--
it
closes
this
courtroom
at
a
certain
time
and
only
allows
certain
to
speak
in
the
courtroom.
mr.
thomas
r.
asher
(inaudible)
time,
place,
and
manner
are
perfectly
permissible
while
one
may
have
a
right
to
speak
in
--
in
the
capital
building
during
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
thomas
r.
asher
certainly
not
--
mr.
thomas
r.
asher
certainly
not
on
the
basis
of
the
content
and
if
on
a
content
at
all,
certainly
not
on
the
basis
of
the
fact
that
controversial
speech
will
be
excluded.
mr.
thomas
r.
asher
it's
--
it's
a
--
it's
a
very,
very
difficult
distinction
to
make
mr.
justice
stewart
and
--
and
certainly
this
court
has
--
has
many
--
many
cases
suggested
that
the
--
that
regardless
of
whether
or
not
one
is
--
what
is
responsible.
one
has
--
has
a
right
to
speak,
that
may
--
the
answer
to
the
question
is,
“if
--
if
a
form
is
unlimited,
then
--
then
probably
you
cannot
distinguish
on
the
grounds
if
--
if
this
man
irresponsible
and
that
man
is
responsible.”
however,
if
the
form
is
limited,
it
may
be
a
reasonable
ground
to
suggest
that
one
man
is
speaking
for
a
broader
audience
than
another.
we
--
we
constantly
face
allocated
problems
when
--
when
two
people
want
a
parade
permit
to
go
on
the
same
street
at
the
same
time,
the
government
has
to
make
an
allocative
decision
and
there
are
numerous
reasonable
grounds
in
which
you
could
do
it.
now,
responsibility
maybe
one
of
them,
although
i
find
it
the
most
troublesome
simply
because
it's
the
kind
of
judgment
that
--
that
is
most
attacked
with
censorship.
mr.
thomas
r.
asher
well,
this
court
has
certainly
suggested
that
in
terms
of
--
in
--
in
cases
such
as
valentine
and
breard.
mr.
thomas
r.
asher
yes,
but
it's
an
inverse
classification.
mr.
thomas
r.
asher
instead
of
--
instead
of
saying
--
mr.
thomas
r.
asher
i
think
we
do.
but
i
think
--
i
think
that
--
that
the
classification
is
unreasonable
and
impermissible
on
its
face,
unless
this
court
is
prepared
to
state
that
somehow
or
rather
it's
permissible
for
--
for
a
governmentally
operated
form
to
say,
“commercial
speech
would
be
permitted
and
--
and
political
speech
will
not.”
and
every
single
time
this
court
has
been
addressed
with
that
question.it
is
answered
--
it
is
answered
in
the
negative
--
mr.
thomas
r.
asher
oh
we
have
numerous
classifications
but
--
that
we
will
allow
political
speech
by
political
parties
to
raise
money,
we
won't
allow
it
for
other
purposes,
which
--
which
in
a
way
touch
--
touches
upon
another
unreasonable
aspect
of
--
of
the
entire
scheme
that
seems
to
be
evolving
here.
notably,
we
start
out
with
--
with
what
we
--
what
presumably
would
be
a
neutral
approach
to
--
to
marketing
advertising
time
and
immediately,
the
neutrality
is
removed
by
saying,
“controversial
speech
is
going
to
be
let
out.”
it's
going
to
be
excluded.
so
the
--
we
slip
from
neutrality
of
time,
place,
and
manner
at
least
as
--
which
has
been
held
permissible
in
--
in
numerous
cases
into
an
unneutral
area
which
--
which
is
invidious.
it
--
it
excludes
political
speech
and
permits
commercial
speech,
free
roam,
free
reign
within
that
airtime.
and
if
not
free
reign
of
some
controls
or
exercise,
at
least
an
opportunity
to
speak
and
that's
all
that
we
seek
here
and
nothing
more.
mr.
thomas
r.
asher
well,
we've
been
--
we've
been
hard-pressed
to
try
to
find
any
--
any
of
the
interest
that
have
been
--
been
asserted
by
the
broadcasters
that
--
that
can
be
regarded
as
overwhelming.
one
--
one
is
the
danger
that
perhaps
the
rich
will
--
will
buy
up
the
time
and
somehow
set
the
agenda
of
debate.
mr.
thomas
r.
asher
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
thomas
r.
asher
the
broadcasters
regulating
their
own
time?
mr.
thomas
r.
asher
that's
right.
mr.
thomas
r.
asher
and
--
and
no
--
no
one
is
questioning
the
broadcasters'
right
to
regulate
it
in
term
of
saying,
“we're
going
to
market
so
much
to
sell
to
others.
we're
going
to
keep
so
much
for
ourselves
to
say
what
we
want
to.”
were
just
talking
about
that
time
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
thomas
r.
asher
that's
right.
that's
the
only
ground
on
which
we
were
kept
out.
if
you
look
at
the
policy
that
was
--
of
--
of
wtop
radio
station
on
which
the
business
executive
group
was
excluded,
the
only
ground
on
which
it
was
excluded
was
the
controversiality
of
its
message.
no
other
ground
or
whatever
and
strictly
that
narrow
discrimination
that
we're
talking
about.
that
number
of
--
of
what
i
would
regard
as
false
horrors
have
been
paraded
to
the
court
as
to
what
might
happen
if
it
were
acknowledged
that
there
is
no
right
not
to
discriminate.
no.
i'm
sorry,
no
right
to
discriminate
or
a
right
to
be
required
not
to
discriminate.
one
--
somehow
or
other
that
the
rich
might
buy
up
all
the
time,
i
think
that
that's
the
best
speculative
danger
of
--
because
we
--
if
--
if
we
look
at
the
nature
of
--
of
editorial
advertising
in
the
newspapers,
we
find
it
for
the
most
part,
editorial
advertising
is
utilized
by
disadvantaged
groups
that
somehow
or
other
feel
their
views
have
already
been
excluded.
the
--
the
rich
on
the
other
hand
are
not
monolithic
by
any
means
and
if
general
motors
in
fact,
decided
that
rather
than
--
than
trying
to
sell
cars
it
was
going
to
use
all
the
time
it
could
buy
up
to
talk
about
political
issues.one
that
would
run
completely
counter
to
the
situation
we
see
in
--
in
the
newspaper
area
where
we
find
very
little
politicizing
by
--
by
commercial
interest.
secondly,
that
--
that
subject
wasn't
briefed
to
this
court.
but
thirdly,
even
if
it
were
done,
even
if
--
if
corporations
utilized
advertising
time
to
address
issues
rather
to
simply
demerits
of
products
is
that
necessarily
and
undesirable
first
amendment
consequent
so
long
as
we
have
the
fairness
doctrine
to
assure
that
there
is
balance.
now,
another
one
of
the
dangers
that's
been
advanced
is
that
somehow
or
other
the
fairness
doctrine
will
be
wrecked
if
we
have
it
--
have
a
--
a
requirement
that
editorial
speech
not
be
excluded
from
advertising
time.
and
again,
there's
no
basis
or
whatever
for
reaching
this
conclusion.
numerous
stations
is
acknowledged
by
the
broadcasters
already
carried
editorial
advertisements.
none
of
them
have
come
forward
to
say
that
somehow
or
other
as
a
result
of
our
doing
this
we're
about
to
go
under,
we're
being
swamped.
the
cullman
doctrine
which
requires
that
broadcasters
give
free
time
for
response
only
comes
about
in
two
circumstances.one,
where
a
controversial
--
or
three
circumstances
--
controversial
issue
of
public
important
isn't
--
has
not
been
dealt
with
fairly
by
the
broadcaster,
where
there's
an
imbalance
in
the
broadcasters'
program.
and
one
of
the
cigarette
cases
that
the
fcc
has
held
an
8-to-1
balance
of
pro
cigarette
to
anti
cigarette
advertisements
is
reasonable.
so
the
broadcasters
have
tremendous
latitude
in
which
to
determine
what
is
balanced.
secondly,
no
one
is
paid
to
come
forward
to
put
on
the
other
side.
and
thirdly,
the
broadcaster
in
his
own
programming
is
not
in
one
way
or
another
elected
to
present
the
other
side
only
in
those
circumstances,
must
they
give
time
free
to
someone
to
present
an
alternative
view
point?
now,
remember,
we're
--
we're
not
talking
about
every
issue
in
the
world,
we're
talking
about
issues
that
are
both
controversial
and
of
public
importance.
notably,
those
issues
which
not
only
the
fairness
doctrine
applies
to
but
--
but
are
specifically
excluded
under
the
flat
ban
policy
that
we
asked
to
this
court
to
declare
unconstitutional.
now,
if
an
issue
is
both
controversial
and
of
public
importance,
presumably
a
broadcaster
if
he's
fulfilling
his
fairness
doctrine
obligation
is
already
going
to
be
covered
--
covering
that
issue.
it's
very
unlikely
that
letting
on
a
particular
spokesman
is
going
to
throw
this
programming
into
imbalance
and
the
facts
of
the
bem
case
indicate
that.
wtop
has
argued
that
it
has
presented
both
sides
of
the
war
in
--
in
extreme
balance.
keeping
in
mind
the
eight
to
one
ratio
that
the
commission
has
held
to
be
reasonable
selling
three
or
four
minutes
to
one
group
or
another
group
to
express
their
views
on
the
issue
to
supplement
what
the
broadcasters
already
put
on
in
news
time.
he's
not
going
to
throw
his
programming
into
imbalance.
the
one
place
in
which
--
in
which
we
might
find
a
problem,
the
broadcaster
being
faced
with
either
an
economic
burden
under
the
fairness
doctrine
or
--
or
encourage
it
upon
his
discretion
as
to
what
issue
should
be
covered
is
where
a
new
issue
comes
up.
or
at
issue
that
the
broadcaster
for
one
reason
or
another,
even
though
its
controversial,
and
even
though
it's
a
public
importance,
a
broadcaster
is
elected
not
to
put
on
the
air.
and
some
member
of
the
public
feeling
that
it's
so
important
has
gone
forth
with
his
money
and
paid
the
money,
and
bought
time,
and
raised
that
issue,
then,
the
broadcaster
obviously
not
having
covered
it.
probably,
he's
not
been
fulfilling
his
fairness
doctrine
obligation.
he
may
have
overlooked
the
issue.
and
so,
in
furtherance
of
first
amendment
objective
of
what
--
of
robust
wide
open
debate,
a
new
issue
would
have
been
brought
to
public
attention,
and
how
the
broadcaster
deals
with
it
need
not
impose
any
great
economic
burden.
primarily,
the
broadcaster
will
deal
with
that
issue
by
either
dealing
with
the
news
time;
perhaps
another
member
of
the
public
will
come
forward
and
buy
time
to
present
--
present
the
other
side.
but
in
any
event,
the
broadcaster
is
going
to
be
subjected
to
no
burden
that
he
--
he's
not
--
he's
not
already
required
to
address
under
--
under
the
fairness
doctrine
because
we're
only
talking
about
controversial
issues
and
public
importance.
we're
not
talking
about
those
kinds
of
issues
which
the
broadcaster
somehow
or
other
suggest
they
should
--
they
should
exclude.
one
of
the
broadcasters
suggest
that
trivial
issues
might
be
excludable.well
it's
trivial
but
it's
not
controversial
and
of
public
importance.
we're
only
talking
about
the
burning
issues
of
the
day,
those
very
issues
that
the
broadcaster
must
address
in
his
programming
time
under
the
fairness
doctrine
and
must
address
with
balance.
i
think
that
--
that
i've
--
i've
covered
pretty
much
those
areas
that
--
that
were
not
covered

except
to
suggest
that
--
that
the
question
of
programming
time
as
far
as
we're
concerned
in
the
context
of
this
case,
must
be
looked
at
very
narrowly.
notably,
if
a
broadcaster
regularly
markets
programming
time
to
others,
then
again,
it
would
be
invidious
to
say,
“i'll
market
it
to
you
if
you
want
to
talk
about
a
commercial
subject
but
not
about
a
controversial
one.”
on
the
other
hand,
if
a
broadcaster
markets
only
spot
advertising
time,
which
is
--
which
is
the
case
in
--
with
the
number
of
broadcasters
then
that's
what
we're
talking
about.
and
we're
saying,
“that's
what
he
can't
discriminate.”
but
nonetheless,
the
basic
question
is
discrimination
and
basic
judgment
is
the
broadcasters
as
to
what
he
is
going
to
subject
to
--
what
--
what
type
of
time
he
is
going
to
put
up
for
sale.
when
he
puts
time
up
for
sale,
then
he
is
to
be
held
the
requirement
that
he
need
--
that
he
not
discriminate
invidiously
between
that
which
is
controversial
and
that
which
is
not.
thank
you.
