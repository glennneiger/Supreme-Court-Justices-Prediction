mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
a
group
of
four
related
cases
all
here
on
writs
of
certiorari
to
review
the
same
decision
of
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
circuit.
the
questions
arise
out
of
two
proceedings
commenced
by
a
separate
letter
of
communications
to
the
federal
communications
commission.
the
first
letter
of
complaint
was
sent
to
the
commission
on
january
22,
1970
by
an
organization
known
as
business
executives'
move
for
vietnam
peace
customarily
called
bem
in
these
proceedings.
now,
this
complaint
appears
at
page
291
of
the
appendix.
bem
sought
an
order
from
the
communications
commission
to
compel
washington
radio
station
wtop
to
run
spot
announcements
against
the
vietnam
war
either
free
of
charge
or
for
a
fee.
although
bem's
specific
complaint
related
to
advertising
time,
its
arguments
were
not
confined
to
this.
the
substance
of
the
complaint
appears
near
the
end
at
page
296
of
the
appendix
and
i
will
read
the
first
full
paragraph
at
the
top
of
page
296.
“for
the
reasons
stated
above,
the
business
executive
move
for
vietnam
peace
request
that
the
federal
communications
commission
ordered
wtop
to
broadcast
free
of
charge
bem's
one
minute
announcements
or
in
the
alternative
that
the
commission
required
wtop
to
sell
bem
airtime
for
broadcasting
of
these
announcements.
the
respondent
in
that
matter
post-newsweek
stations
replied
to
the
complaint
by
a
letter
and
there
were
further
filings
by
letter
which
appears
in
the
appendix.
there
was
no
hearing
or
any
submission
of
evidence
or
arguments
other
than
these
letters.
the
other
proceeding
before
the
commission
began
on
may
19,
1970
when
the
democratic
national
committee
wrote
to
the
commission
requesting
a
declaratory
ruling
which
would
allow
it
to
buy
time
in
order
to
comment
on
public
issues
and
solicit
funds.
this
letter
begins
on
page
15
of
the
appendix
and
the
essence
of
it
is
on
the
opening
page
of
page
15.
and
there,
the
democratic
national
committee
requested
the
commission
to
issue
a
declaratory
ruling
that
under
the
first
amendment
of
the
constitution
and
the
communications
act,
a
broadcaster
may
not
as
a
general
policy
refuse
to
sell
time
to
responsible
entities
such
as
the
dnc
for
the
solicitation
of
funds
and
for
comment
on
public
issues.
dnc
indicated
that
it
wanted
the
time
for
the
broadcaster's
specific
programs
of
varying
durations
and
for
spot
announcements
of
varying
durations.
dnc
said
that
the
primary
reason
for
wanting
this
time
was
at
it
was
in
debt
and
it
needed
the
money
that
television
solicitation
could
bring
in.
it
did
not
limit
its
claim
to
advertising
time.
it
relied
on
the
first
amendment
but
it
recognize
that
even
under
the
--
its
first
amendment
claims
that
broadcasters
could
limit
the
use
of
their
facilities
to,
and
i
quote
their
words,
“responsible
spokesman”
and
it
recognize
that
broadcasters
could
adopt
procedures
to
ensure
that
the
presentation
was
in
good
taste.
the
commission
asked
for
comments
from
the
three
broadcasting
networks.
the
national
broadcasting
company
responded
that
it
had
no
policy
against
selling
time
to
a
political
party
and
that
it
would
permit
solicitation
of
funds
on
such
a
program.
it
added
that
it
had
offered
to
sell
time
to
dnc
but
was
advised
that
the
committee
did
not
wish
to
proceed
with
the
purchase.
both
the
american
broadcasting
companies
and
the
columbia
broadcasting
system
responded
saying
in
substance
that
they
were
bound
to
comply
with
the
fairness
doctrine
established
by
the
commission
and
upheld
by
this
court
in
the
red
lion
case
in
395
u.s.
but
that
it
was
their
policy
not
to
accept
sponsored
discussions
of
political
or
controversial
issues
or
to
allow
solicitation
funds.
the
position
of
cbs
may
be
summarized
by
referring
to
page
51
of
the
appendix,
about
two
inches
from
the
top
of
the
text.
in
adopting
this
policy
we
concluded
that
we
could
not
provide
coverage
of
significant
issues
with
fairness
and
balance
if
partisans
with
strong
financial
resources
could
preempt
our
facilities
to
present
their
viewpoints
on
issues
they
select.
a
policy
of
selling
time
to
partisans
within
our
view
necessarily
distort
the
matter
in
which
issues
were
presented
to
the
listening
and
viewing
public.
cbs
has
concluded
that
as
a
licensee
and
a
medium
with
a
finite
amount
of
time
to
provide
news,
information
and
entertainment,
we
best
serve
the
public
by
presenting
issues
and
view
points
within
a
balance
programed
schedule
utilizing
news
worthiness
as
a
sole
criteria.
on
august
5,
1970
the
commission
denied
bem's
complaint.
commissioner
cox
made
a
concurring
statement
and
commissioner
johnson
dissented.
a
week
later
on
august
12th,
the
commission
issued
a
memorandum
opinion
and
order
denying
the
request
of
dnc
for
a
declaratory
ruling.
again,
commissioner
cox
concurred
and
commissioner
johnson
dissented.
the
commission
in
its
opinions
did
not
really
focus
on
advertising
time
except
in
response
to
commissioner
johnson's
dissent
in
the
dnc
case.
and
even
there,
the
commission
appears
to
be
talking
about
both
programming
and
advertising
time
similarly
in
the
bem
opinion.
the
commission
does
not
highlight
advertising
time
though
that
was
all
that
was
involved
in
bem's
complain.
now,
following
these
decisions,
bem
and
dnc
filed
separate
appeals
in
the
court
of
appeals.
the
federal
communications
commission
and
the
united
states
were
the
respondents.
and
the
two
cases
were
consolidated
there,
post-newsweek
stations,
american
broadcasting
companies,
and
columbia
broadcasting
system
intervened.
the
court
of
appeals
reversed
the
decision
of
the
commission
in
an
opinion
by
judge
wright
concurred
in
by
judge
robinson
and
judge
mcgowan
filed
a
dissenting
opinion.
the
four
cases
now
here
were
filed
to
review
this
decision
according
to
the
varying
and
risk
of
the
seven
parties
involved.
a
post-newsweek
stations
filed
a
petition
with
bem
as
respondent.
columbia
broadcasting
system
and
american
broadcasting
companies
filed
a
petition,
separate
petitions
with
dnc
as
respondent.
and
the
united
states
and
the
federal
communications
commission
filed
petitions
against
both
complainants,
bem
and
dnc.
in
many
respects,
the
positions
of
the
united
states
and
the
commission
on
the
one
hand
are
similar
to
those
of
the
broadcasters,
on
the
other.
in
particular,
speaking
for
the
commission
and
the
united
states,
however,
i
should
point
out
this
possible
difference.
in
particular,
i
am
interested
in
maintaining
the
preposition
that
this
is
an
area
in
which
the
commission
is
properly
concerned.
and
were
it
has
authority
to
act,
if
it
should
determine
that
affirmative
action
on
its
part
is
appropriate.
i
should
let
the
broadcaster
speak
for
themselves,
but
they
would,
i
gather
from
their
briefs,
preferred
to
have
it
establish
that
the
commission
cannot
act
at
all
in
this
area
consistently
with
their
first
amendment
rights.
these
differences
does
not
seem
to
me
to
be
essential
in
the
present
case,
as
long
as
it
can
be
determined
that
the
commission
acted
properly
when
it
decided
not
to
act
in
these
cases.
now,
there's
one
more
factual
situation
which
i
should
put
before
the
court.
while
this
case
was
pending
before
the
court
of
appeals
on
june
19,
1971,
the
commission
published
a
notice
in
the
federal
register
initiating
a
broad
study
into
the
efficacy
of
the
fairness
doctrine.
the
commissions
specifically
under
took
the
study,
“in
the
light
of
current
demands
for
access
to
the
broadcast
media
to
consider
issues
of
public
concern.”
the
commission
noted,
however,
that
it
could
not
abandon
the
fairness
doctrine
since
that
is
ratified
by
act
of
congress
or
treat
broadcasters
as
common
carriers.
what
the
commission
said
--
sought
it
said,
“was
whether
the
policies
it
had
developed
are
the
most
effective
means
of
fostering
uninhibited
robust
wide
open
debate
on
public
issues.”
when,
in
january
and
february
of
this
year
there
was
a
period
when
the
mandate
of
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case
was
not
stayed,
the
commission
published
a
further
notice
soliciting
comments
on
the
procedures
and
guidelines
necessary
to
carry
out
the
mandate
of
the
court
of
appeals.
this
letter
notice
was
withdrawn.
when
this
court
granted
the
certiorari
and
stayed
the
mandate
of
the
court
of
appeals.
but
the
commission
has
continued
its
overall
inquiry
into
the
fairness
doctrine
and
its
operation,
and
has
requested
comments
on
what
policies,
if
any,
should
be
adopted
with
respect
to
access
to
the
broadcast
media.
it
has
confined
its
inquiry
to
the
non-constitutional
aspects
of
access
because
the
first
amendment
issue
was
pending
before
this
court.
it
added
that
its
final
decision
maybe
delayed
and
made
--
made
in
light
of
the
supreme
court's
decision.
i
am
advised
that
this
inquiry
is
proceeding
actively
and
that
the
problems
are
under
current
consideration
by
the
commission.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes
sir,
i
understand
sir.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
both
--
both
hearings
and
written
submissions.
before
going
further,
it's
relevant
to
observe
that
the
commission
has
not
here
ordered
anyone
to
do
anything.what
it
has
done
is
simply
to
stay
its
hand.
the
ultimate
question
then
is
whether
there
is
something
in
the
first
amendment
which
requires
the
commission
to
order
broadcasters
to
accept
editorial
advertising
regardless
of
their
compliance
otherwise
with
the
fairness
doctrine.
obviously,
there
is
nothing
literally
in
the
first
amendment
which
leads
to
this
result.
it
can
be
found
only
by
a
rather
broad
construction
of
that
amendment,
a
construction
incidentally
which
if
applied
there's
a
printed
press,
namely
that
they
must
accept
advertising
offered
to
--
to
them,
at
least
if
paid
for,
would
surely
be
regarded
by
them
as
an
abridgment
of
the
freedom
of
the
press
contrary
to
the
explicit
provisions
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
--
of
the
first
amendment.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes,
mr.
chief
justice.
that
was
clearly
recognized
in
the
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals
which
did
not
decide
that
either
of
these
complainants
was
entitled
to
have
its
advertising
broadcast.
it
simply
decided
that
the
commission
must
establish
means
for
working
out
who
could
broadcast,
and
at
what
times,
and
if
there
were
more
people
applying
than
there
was
time
for,
how
they
should
be
selected
specifically
referred
to
it
as
an
abridgable
right
to
speak
and
the
abridgable
element
in
it
rose
out
of
the
fact
that
there
is
inherently
a
limited
amount
of
time
available.
so,
as
i
will
suggest
later
on,
this
would
put
the
commission
into
deep
entanglement
with
the
operation
of
the
--
the
actual
operation
and
the
editorial
judgment
of
the
stations.
now,
commissioner
johnson
and
his
dissenting
opinion
intimated,
perhaps
i
could
use
a
stronger
word
than
that,
that
the
way
to
deal
with
this
was
to
abolish
the
fairness
doctrine
and
do
it
on
a
first-come-first-serve
basis
and
when
the
time
was
up
established
on
some
basis,
then
nobody
else
could
get
in.
that
we
think
is
something
which
it
is
very
hard
to
find
in
the
constitution
and
something
which
is
very
much
an
administrative
matter
which
it
is
in
the
province
of
congress
through
its
delegatee,
the
commission
to
determine.
for
that
reason,
i
say
that
constitutionally
i
think
that
this
case
involves
more
of
the
separation
of
powers
than
it
does
of
the
first
amendment.
of
course,
we
fully
agree
as
the
court
said
in
red
lion
that
the
first
amendment
is
not
irrelevant.
the
underlying
problem
here
is
undoubtably
a
subtle
one.
when
dealing
with
a
medium
to
which
there
is
inherently
limited
access,
what
is
the
best
way
to
protect
the
public's
right
to
hear,
and
see,
and
learn?
basically,
in
the
present
state
of
knowledge
and
in
the
absence
of
any
specifically
applicable
provision
in
the
first
amendment
or
elsewhere
in
the
constitution,
this
should
be,
i
submit,
a
problem
to
be
worked
out
by
congress
and
without
the
rigidity
which
would
result
from
an
extension
of
the
first
amendment
well
beyond
its
language.
congress
has
exercised
its
power
in
the
communications
act
and
has
delegated
oversight
and
rule-making
to
the
communications
commission
which
has
been
actively,
and
effectively
engaged,
and
the
complicated,
and
essentially
experimental
task
for
many
years.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
well,
certainly
that's
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
--
true
mr.
justice,
literally.
in
the
red
lion
case,
the
argument
was
made
on
behalf
of
the
broadcasters
that
you
can't
have
a
fairness
doctrine.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
think
the
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
think
mr.
justice
that
you
get
into
an
argument
about
the
first
amendment
when
you
begin
to
talk
about
first
amendment
values.
now,
i
do
not
--
i
do
not
(inaudible)
first
amendment
values.
i
think
they
are
very
important.
but
the
contention
is
made
that
in
order
to
protect
first
amendment
values
you
must
give
these
complainants
an
opportunity
to
express
their
views
over
this
medium
which
is
--
which
so
enormously
multiplies
their
voice,
but
i
agree
with
you
literally
that
no
one
is
preventing
the
--
the
complainants
from
exercising
either
their
freedom
to
speak
or
their
freedom
of
the
press
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
unless
the
government
is
under
some
sort
of
a
--
a
duty
to
help
them
to
protect
their
first
amendment
value.
now
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
well,
i
would
have
supposed
that
was
true
mr.
justice,
but
congress
on
february
7,
passed
a
statute
giving
access
to
political
candidates
to
the
radio,
and
television,
and
included
in
it
to
the
extent
that
any
person
sells
space
in
any
newspaper
or
magazine
to
a
legally
qualified
candidate
for
federal
elective
office
then
they
must
sell
space
to
other
candidates.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
that
is
not
--
that
is
not
here
but
i
--
i
--
that's
one
reason
i'm
a
little
hesitant
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
--
about
making
what
i
think
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
--
i
would
otherwise
have
made
as
my
answer.
i
think
it
had
always
previously
been
understood
that
the
press
was
under
no
obligation
whatever
to
print
anything
it
didn't
want
to
print.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
well,
i
--
i
would
be
happy
to
accept
that
view.
there
are
expressions
in
some
of
the
opinions.
at
least,
for
purposes
of
this
case,
i
would
be
happy
to
accept
that
view.
there
are
expressions
in
some
of
the
opinions
about
first
amendment
values
which
seem
to
indicate
that
when
there
is
government
participation
there
is
an
--
a
brooding
on
the
presence
of
the
first
amendment
in
the
sky
which
must
be
taken
into
account.
as
the
court
said
in
the
red
lion
case,
if
experience
with
the
administration
of
these
doctrines
indicates
that
they
have
a
net
effect
of
reducing
rather
than
enhancing
the
volume
and
quality
of
coverage,
there
will
be
time
enough
to
consider
the
constitutional
implications,
and
i
think
that
is
what
is
making
me
find
difficulty
in
answering
your
question.
if
it
does
appear
and
experience
that
this
does
really
prevent
serious
difficulties
in
the
public's
opportunity
to
learn
about
political
candidate
then
i
suspect
that
there
will
be
those
who
will
raise
constitutional
arguments
which
will
have
to
be
answered.
but
the
use
of
the
word
quality
of
coverage
in
the
passage
seems
particularly
relevant
here
under
the
decision
below
the
broadcaster
loses
control
over
the
quality
of
the
paid
advertisements
which
he
must
accept.
the
present
state
of
experience
point
strongly
to
the
conclusion
that
the
public
is
better
served
by
giving
scope
to
the
journalistic
judgment
of
the
broadcaster's
subject
to
the
continued
constraint
of
the
fairness
doctrine.
“if
real
experience
to
the
contrary
develops
there
will
be
time
enough,”
as
the
court
said
to
reconsider
the
constitutional
implications.
as
i
have
indicated
the
commission
has
the
matter
now
under
active
reconsideration
in
the
light
of
experience
and
of
the
claims
which
have
been
made,
the
commission
as
acting
pursuant
to
powers
expressly
assigned
to
it
by
congress
and
the
exercise
of
its
commerce
power,
which
--
and
other
powers
which
has
set
up
a
system
of
broadcasting
in
this
country
under
private
ownership
and
control
subject
to
regulation
by
the
commission.
now,
the
congress
has
expressly
provided
in
section
38
of
the
communications
act
that
persons
engaged
in
broadcasting
shall
not
be
a
common
carrier.congress
has
also
provided
equal
time
for
political
candidates
and
more
recently
for
a
right
access
for
political
candidates.
the
congress
has
further
provided
that
licensees
shall
hold
their
licenses
for
three
years.
it's
charge
the
commission
to
use
the
standard
of
the
public
interest
in
renewing
licenses
and
it
has
provided
in
section
3
(r)
as
this
court
quoted
in
the
red
lion
opinion,
a
mandate
to
the
commission
from
time
to
time
as
public
convenience,
interest
or
necessity
requires
to
promulgate
such
rules
and
regulations,
and
prescribe
such
restrictions,
and
conditions
as
maybe
necessary
to
carryout
the
provisions
of
this
chapter.
in
carrying
out
this
charge,
the
commission
has
developed
the
reply
to
attack
rule
and
the
fairness
doctrine,
both
of
which
work
upheld
by
this
court
in
red
lion.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
think
their
position
might
be
different.
i
think
i
would
rather
have
them
speak
for
themselves.
i'm
not
at
all
sure
though
that
if
this
court
had
held
that
the
fairness
doctrine
was
invalid
as
a
--
an
undue
interference
in
violation
of
the
first
amendment
rights
of
the
broadcasters
that
it
wouldn't
almost
be
a
fortiorari
case
to
say
that
--
that
they
would
have
no
rights
here.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no,
mr.
justice.
i
don't
think
it's
that
they
are
reluctant
to.
i
think
it
is
that
they
feel
it
is
not
necessary
and
that
the
“first
amendment
value”
involved
in
the
picture
is
adequately
taken
care
of
by
the
fairness
act.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
what
it
is,
i
think
it
is
to
a
very
considerable
extent.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
think
the
--
i
think
that
as
commissioner
johnson
said
in
his
dissenting
opinion,
i
think
it
pretty
much
involves
the
abolition
of
the
fairness
doctrine.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
it
is
certainly
a
very
large
element
in
the
overall
picture.
now,
i
don't
understand
that
red
lion
was
a
constitutional
case
in
the
sense
that
it
decided
that
the
fairness
doctrine
was
required
by
the
first
amendment.
on
the
contrary
it
was,
as
i
see
it,
an
administrative
law
case
holding
that
the
commission
under
the
authority
granted
to
it
by
congress
and
the
power
to,
just
have
the
power
to
establish
the
fairness
doctrine
and
congress
had
the
power
to
ratify
it
in
1959.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
and
as
far
as
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
as
far
as
the
constitution
was
involved
that
there
was
nothing
in
the
first
amendment
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
--
which
made
the
fairness
doctrine
invalid.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
that
seems
to
me
it
was
a
--
it
was
a
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
whether
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
--
whether
congress
was
prevented
from
treating
this
as
an
administrative
doctrine
because
of
the
first
amendment.
there
is
no
suggestion
that
the
stations
involved
in
this
case
do
not
comply
with
the
fairness
doctrine.
they
do
present
discussions
of
controversial
and
political
issues.
the
question
is
whether
they
must
nevertheless
takes
spot
announcements
and
perhaps
put
on
programs
on
public
interest
--
issues
from
anyone
who
wants
to
pay
for
the
time.
and
then
very
likely
pursuant
to
the
fairness
doctrine
have
to
allow
free
time
to
those
who
want
to
present
the
other
side,
if
no
one
can
be
found
for
the
presentation
of
the
other
point
of
view.
it's
hard
to
think
of
anything
which
more
effectively
destroys
the
freedom
and
control
of
the
broadcasters
often
called
the
electronic
press.
it's
likewise
hard
to
think
that
the
public
will
be
well-served
by
a
system
which
makes
access
to
the
airways
on
controversial
issues,
depend
in
material
extent
on
who
has
the
money
to
pay
for
it.
and
perhaps
on
who
has
the
most
money
as
the
price
is
bid
up.
as
judge
mcgowan
said
in
the
court
below,
“that
approach
does
not
seem
to
me
to
be
a
promising
one
in
terms
of
the
public's
right
to
know.”
and
he
added,
“it
is
hardly
the
part
of
wisdom
to
scrap
our
present
system
of
private
broadcasting
for
a
system
in
which
money
alone
determines
what
items
are
to
be
aired
and
in
what
format.”
are
these
not
issues
of
the
sort
that
congress
should
determine
with
the
aid
of
the
agency
in
the
light
of
experience
and
without
premature
constitutional
restraint?
the
fairness
doctrine
has
been
developing
for
more
than
40
years.
this
has
been
done
under
the
watchful
eye
of
this
court
and
with
recognition,
as
this
court
said
in
the
pottsville
broadcasting
case,
that
the
administrative
process
should
possessed
sufficient
flexibility
to
adjust
itself
to
the
rapidly
fluctuating
factors,
character
--
characteristic
of
the
evolution
of
broadcasting.
through
the
fairness
doctrine
as
it
has
developed,
there
is
a
clear
duty
on
the
broadcaster,
but
he
is
still
a
private
businessman
as
a
part
of
a
deliberately
adopted
system
of
private
broadcasting,
and
he
is
not
only
free
but
obligated
to
exercise
his
journalistic
discretion.
they
considered
and
experienced
judgment
of
the
commission
that
this
is
not
a
situation
in
which
it
should
take
affirmative
action,
it
should
be
upheld
and
accordingly
the
judgment
below
should
be
reversed.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
a
group
of
four
related
cases
all
here
on
writs
of
certiorari
to
review
the
same
decision
of
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
circuit.
the
questions
arise
out
of
two
proceedings
commenced
by
a
separate
letter
of
communications
to
the
federal
communications
commission.
the
first
letter
of
complaint
was
sent
to
the
commission
on
january
22,
1970
by
an
organization
known
as
business
executives'
move
for
vietnam
peace
customarily
called
bem
in
these
proceedings.
now,
this
complaint
appears
at
page
291
of
the
appendix.
bem
sought
an
order
from
the
communications
commission
to
compel
washington
radio
station
wtop
to
run
spot
announcements
against
the
vietnam
war
either
free
of
charge
or
for
a
fee.
although
bem's
specific
complaint
related
to
advertising
time,
its
arguments
were
not
confined
to
this.
the
substance
of
the
complaint
appears
near
the
end
at
page
296
of
the
appendix
and
i
will
read
the
first
full
paragraph
at
the
top
of
page
296.
“for
the
reasons
stated
above,
the
business
executive
move
for
vietnam
peace
request
that
the
federal
communications
commission
ordered
wtop
to
broadcast
free
of
charge
bem's
one
minute
announcements
or
in
the
alternative
that
the
commission
required
wtop
to
sell
bem
airtime
for
broadcasting
of
these
announcements.
the
respondent
in
that
matter
post-newsweek
stations
replied
to
the
complaint
by
a
letter
and
there
were
further
filings
by
letter
which
appears
in
the
appendix.
there
was
no
hearing
or
any
submission
of
evidence
or
arguments
other
than
these
letters.
the
other
proceeding
before
the
commission
began
on
may
19,
1970
when
the
democratic
national
committee
wrote
to
the
commission
requesting
a
declaratory
ruling
which
would
allow
it
to
buy
time
in
order
to
comment
on
public
issues
and
solicit
funds.
this
letter
begins
on
page
15
of
the
appendix
and
the
essence
of
it
is
on
the
opening
page
of
page
15.
and
there,
the
democratic
national
committee
requested
the
commission
to
issue
a
declaratory
ruling
that
under
the
first
amendment
of
the
constitution
and
the
communications
act,
a
broadcaster
may
not
as
a
general
policy
refuse
to
sell
time
to
responsible
entities
such
as
the
dnc
for
the
solicitation
of
funds
and
for
comment
on
public
issues.
dnc
indicated
that
it
wanted
the
time
for
the
broadcaster's
specific
programs
of
varying
durations
and
for
spot
announcements
of
varying
durations.
dnc
said
that
the
primary
reason
for
wanting
this
time
was
at
it
was
in
debt
and
it
needed
the
money
that
television
solicitation
could
bring
in.
it
did
not
limit
its
claim
to
advertising
time.
it
relied
on
the
first
amendment
but
it
recognize
that
even
under
the
--
its
first
amendment
claims
that
broadcasters
could
limit
the
use
of
their
facilities
to,
and
i
quote
their
words,
“responsible
spokesman”
and
it
recognize
that
broadcasters
could
adopt
procedures
to
ensure
that
the
presentation
was
in
good
taste.
the
commission
asked
for
comments
from
the
three
broadcasting
networks.
the
national
broadcasting
company
responded
that
it
had
no
policy
against
selling
time
to
a
political
party
and
that
it
would
permit
solicitation
of
funds
on
such
a
program.
it
added
that
it
had
offered
to
sell
time
to
dnc
but
was
advised
that
the
committee
did
not
wish
to
proceed
with
the
purchase.
both
the
american
broadcasting
companies
and
the
columbia
broadcasting
system
responded
saying
in
substance
that
they
were
bound
to
comply
with
the
fairness
doctrine
established
by
the
commission
and
upheld
by
this
court
in
the
red
lion
case
in
395
u.s.
but
that
it
was
their
policy
not
to
accept
sponsored
discussions
of
political
or
controversial
issues
or
to
allow
solicitation
funds.
the
position
of
cbs
may
be
summarized
by
referring
to
page
51
of
the
appendix,
about
two
inches
from
the
top
of
the
text.
in
adopting
this
policy
we
concluded
that
we
could
not
provide
coverage
of
significant
issues
with
fairness
and
balance
if
partisans
with
strong
financial
resources
could
preempt
our
facilities
to
present
their
viewpoints
on
issues
they
select.
a
policy
of
selling
time
to
partisans
within
our
view
necessarily
distort
the
matter
in
which
issues
were
presented
to
the
listening
and
viewing
public.
cbs
has
concluded
that
as
a
licensee
and
a
medium
with
a
finite
amount
of
time
to
provide
news,
information
and
entertainment,
we
best
serve
the
public
by
presenting
issues
and
view
points
within
a
balance
programed
schedule
utilizing
news
worthiness
as
a
sole
criteria.
on
august
5,
1970
the
commission
denied
bem's
complaint.
commissioner
cox
made
a
concurring
statement
and
commissioner
johnson
dissented.
a
week
later
on
august
12th,
the
commission
issued
a
memorandum
opinion
and
order
denying
the
request
of
dnc
for
a
declaratory
ruling.
again,
commissioner
cox
concurred
and
commissioner
johnson
dissented.
the
commission
in
its
opinions
did
not
really
focus
on
advertising
time
except
in
response
to
commissioner
johnson's
dissent
in
the
dnc
case.
and
even
there,
the
commission
appears
to
be
talking
about
both
programming
and
advertising
time
similarly
in
the
bem
opinion.
the
commission
does
not
highlight
advertising
time
though
that
was
all
that
was
involved
in
bem's
complain.
now,
following
these
decisions,
bem
and
dnc
filed
separate
appeals
in
the
court
of
appeals.
the
federal
communications
commission
and
the
united
states
were
the
respondents.
and
the
two
cases
were
consolidated
there,
post-newsweek
stations,
american
broadcasting
companies,
and
columbia
broadcasting
system
intervened.
the
court
of
appeals
reversed
the
decision
of
the
commission
in
an
opinion
by
judge
wright
concurred
in
by
judge
robinson
and
judge
mcgowan
filed
a
dissenting
opinion.
the
four
cases
now
here
were
filed
to
review
this
decision
according
to
the
varying
and
risk
of
the
seven
parties
involved.
a
post-newsweek
stations
filed
a
petition
with
bem
as
respondent.
columbia
broadcasting
system
and
american
broadcasting
companies
filed
a
petition,
separate
petitions
with
dnc
as
respondent.
and
the
united
states
and
the
federal
communications
commission
filed
petitions
against
both
complainants,
bem
and
dnc.
in
many
respects,
the
positions
of
the
united
states
and
the
commission
on
the
one
hand
are
similar
to
those
of
the
broadcasters,
on
the
other.
in
particular,
speaking
for
the
commission
and
the
united
states,
however,
i
should
point
out
this
possible
difference.
in
particular,
i
am
interested
in
maintaining
the
preposition
that
this
is
an
area
in
which
the
commission
is
properly
concerned.
and
were
it
has
authority
to
act,
if
it
should
determine
that
affirmative
action
on
its
part
is
appropriate.
i
should
let
the
broadcaster
speak
for
themselves,
but
they
would,
i
gather
from
their
briefs,
preferred
to
have
it
establish
that
the
commission
cannot
act
at
all
in
this
area
consistently
with
their
first
amendment
rights.
these
differences
does
not
seem
to
me
to
be
essential
in
the
present
case,
as
long
as
it
can
be
determined
that
the
commission
acted
properly
when
it
decided
not
to
act
in
these
cases.
now,
there's
one
more
factual
situation
which
i
should
put
before
the
court.
while
this
case
was
pending
before
the
court
of
appeals
on
june
19,
1971,
the
commission
published
a
notice
in
the
federal
register
initiating
a
broad
study
into
the
efficacy
of
the
fairness
doctrine.
the
commissions
specifically
under
took
the
study,
“in
the
light
of
current
demands
for
access
to
the
broadcast
media
to
consider
issues
of
public
concern.”
the
commission
noted,
however,
that
it
could
not
abandon
the
fairness
doctrine
since
that
is
ratified
by
act
of
congress
or
treat
broadcasters
as
common
carriers.
what
the
commission
said
--
sought
it
said,
“was
whether
the
policies
it
had
developed
are
the
most
effective
means
of
fostering
uninhibited
robust
wide
open
debate
on
public
issues.”
when,
in
january
and
february
of
this
year
there
was
a
period
when
the
mandate
of
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case
was
not
stayed,
the
commission
published
a
further
notice
soliciting
comments
on
the
procedures
and
guidelines
necessary
to
carry
out
the
mandate
of
the
court
of
appeals.
this
letter
notice
was
withdrawn.
when
this
court
granted
the
certiorari
and
stayed
the
mandate
of
the
court
of
appeals.
but
the
commission
has
continued
its
overall
inquiry
into
the
fairness
doctrine
and
its
operation,
and
has
requested
comments
on
what
policies,
if
any,
should
be
adopted
with
respect
to
access
to
the
broadcast
media.
it
has
confined
its
inquiry
to
the
non-constitutional
aspects
of
access
because
the
first
amendment
issue
was
pending
before
this
court.
it
added
that
its
final
decision
maybe
delayed
and
made
--
made
in
light
of
the
supreme
court's
decision.
i
am
advised
that
this
inquiry
is
proceeding
actively
and
that
the
problems
are
under
current
consideration
by
the
commission.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes
sir,
i
understand
sir.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
both
--
both
hearings
and
written
submissions.
before
going
further,
it's
relevant
to
observe
that
the
commission
has
not
here
ordered
anyone
to
do
anything.what
it
has
done
is
simply
to
stay
its
hand.
the
ultimate
question
then
is
whether
there
is
something
in
the
first
amendment
which
requires
the
commission
to
order
broadcasters
to
accept
editorial
advertising
regardless
of
their
compliance
otherwise
with
the
fairness
doctrine.
obviously,
there
is
nothing
literally
in
the
first
amendment
which
leads
to
this
result.
it
can
be
found
only
by
a
rather
broad
construction
of
that
amendment,
a
construction
incidentally
which
if
applied
there's
a
printed
press,
namely
that
they
must
accept
advertising
offered
to
--
to
them,
at
least
if
paid
for,
would
surely
be
regarded
by
them
as
an
abridgment
of
the
freedom
of
the
press
contrary
to
the
explicit
provisions
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
--
of
the
first
amendment.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes,
mr.
chief
justice.
that
was
clearly
recognized
in
the
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals
which
did
not
decide
that
either
of
these
complainants
was
entitled
to
have
its
advertising
broadcast.
it
simply
decided
that
the
commission
must
establish
means
for
working
out
who
could
broadcast,
and
at
what
times,
and
if
there
were
more
people
applying
than
there
was
time
for,
how
they
should
be
selected
specifically
referred
to
it
as
an
abridgable
right
to
speak
and
the
abridgable
element
in
it
rose
out
of
the
fact
that
there
is
inherently
a
limited
amount
of
time
available.
so,
as
i
will
suggest
later
on,
this
would
put
the
commission
into
deep
entanglement
with
the
operation
of
the
--
the
actual
operation
and
the
editorial
judgment
of
the
stations.
now,
commissioner
johnson
and
his
dissenting
opinion
intimated,
perhaps
i
could
use
a
stronger
word
than
that,
that
the
way
to
deal
with
this
was
to
abolish
the
fairness
doctrine
and
do
it
on
a
first-come-first-serve
basis
and
when
the
time
was
up
established
on
some
basis,
then
nobody
else
could
get
in.
that
we
think
is
something
which
it
is
very
hard
to
find
in
the
constitution
and
something
which
is
very
much
an
administrative
matter
which
it
is
in
the
province
of
congress
through
its
delegatee,
the
commission
to
determine.
for
that
reason,
i
say
that
constitutionally
i
think
that
this
case
involves
more
of
the
separation
of
powers
than
it
does
of
the
first
amendment.
of
course,
we
fully
agree
as
the
court
said
in
red
lion
that
the
first
amendment
is
not
irrelevant.
the
underlying
problem
here
is
undoubtably
a
subtle
one.
when
dealing
with
a
medium
to
which
there
is
inherently
limited
access,
what
is
the
best
way
to
protect
the
public's
right
to
hear,
and
see,
and
learn?
basically,
in
the
present
state
of
knowledge
and
in
the
absence
of
any
specifically
applicable
provision
in
the
first
amendment
or
elsewhere
in
the
constitution,
this
should
be,
i
submit,
a
problem
to
be
worked
out
by
congress
and
without
the
rigidity
which
would
result
from
an
extension
of
the
first
amendment
well
beyond
its
language.
congress
has
exercised
its
power
in
the
communications
act
and
has
delegated
oversight
and
rule-making
to
the
communications
commission
which
has
been
actively,
and
effectively
engaged,
and
the
complicated,
and
essentially
experimental
task
for
many
years.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
well,
certainly
that's
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
--
true
mr.
justice,
literally.
in
the
red
lion
case,
the
argument
was
made
on
behalf
of
the
broadcasters
that
you
can't
have
a
fairness
doctrine.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
think
the
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
think
mr.
justice
that
you
get
into
an
argument
about
the
first
amendment
when
you
begin
to
talk
about
first
amendment
values.
now,
i
do
not
--
i
do
not
(inaudible)
first
amendment
values.
i
think
they
are
very
important.
but
the
contention
is
made
that
in
order
to
protect
first
amendment
values
you
must
give
these
complainants
an
opportunity
to
express
their
views
over
this
medium
which
is
--
which
so
enormously
multiplies
their
voice,
but
i
agree
with
you
literally
that
no
one
is
preventing
the
--
the
complainants
from
exercising
either
their
freedom
to
speak
or
their
freedom
of
the
press
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
unless
the
government
is
under
some
sort
of
a
--
a
duty
to
help
them
to
protect
their
first
amendment
value.
now
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
well,
i
would
have
supposed
that
was
true
mr.
justice,
but
congress
on
february
7,
passed
a
statute
giving
access
to
political
candidates
to
the
radio,
and
television,
and
included
in
it
to
the
extent
that
any
person
sells
space
in
any
newspaper
or
magazine
to
a
legally
qualified
candidate
for
federal
elective
office
then
they
must
sell
space
to
other
candidates.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
that
is
not
--
that
is
not
here
but
i
--
i
--
that's
one
reason
i'm
a
little
hesitant
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
--
about
making
what
i
think
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
--
i
would
otherwise
have
made
as
my
answer.
i
think
it
had
always
previously
been
understood
that
the
press
was
under
no
obligation
whatever
to
print
anything
it
didn't
want
to
print.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
well,
i
--
i
would
be
happy
to
accept
that
view.
there
are
expressions
in
some
of
the
opinions.
at
least,
for
purposes
of
this
case,
i
would
be
happy
to
accept
that
view.
there
are
expressions
in
some
of
the
opinions
about
first
amendment
values
which
seem
to
indicate
that
when
there
is
government
participation
there
is
an
--
a
brooding
on
the
presence
of
the
first
amendment
in
the
sky
which
must
be
taken
into
account.
as
the
court
said
in
the
red
lion
case,
if
experience
with
the
administration
of
these
doctrines
indicates
that
they
have
a
net
effect
of
reducing
rather
than
enhancing
the
volume
and
quality
of
coverage,
there
will
be
time
enough
to
consider
the
constitutional
implications,
and
i
think
that
is
what
is
making
me
find
difficulty
in
answering
your
question.
if
it
does
appear
and
experience
that
this
does
really
prevent
serious
difficulties
in
the
public's
opportunity
to
learn
about
political
candidate
then
i
suspect
that
there
will
be
those
who
will
raise
constitutional
arguments
which
will
have
to
be
answered.
but
the
use
of
the
word
quality
of
coverage
in
the
passage
seems
particularly
relevant
here
under
the
decision
below
the
broadcaster
loses
control
over
the
quality
of
the
paid
advertisements
which
he
must
accept.
the
present
state
of
experience
point
strongly
to
the
conclusion
that
the
public
is
better
served
by
giving
scope
to
the
journalistic
judgment
of
the
broadcaster's
subject
to
the
continued
constraint
of
the
fairness
doctrine.
“if
real
experience
to
the
contrary
develops
there
will
be
time
enough,”
as
the
court
said
to
reconsider
the
constitutional
implications.
as
i
have
indicated
the
commission
has
the
matter
now
under
active
reconsideration
in
the
light
of
experience
and
of
the
claims
which
have
been
made,
the
commission
as
acting
pursuant
to
powers
expressly
assigned
to
it
by
congress
and
the
exercise
of
its
commerce
power,
which
--
and
other
powers
which
has
set
up
a
system
of
broadcasting
in
this
country
under
private
ownership
and
control
subject
to
regulation
by
the
commission.
now,
the
congress
has
expressly
provided
in
section
38
of
the
communications
act
that
persons
engaged
in
broadcasting
shall
not
be
a
common
carrier.congress
has
also
provided
equal
time
for
political
candidates
and
more
recently
for
a
right
access
for
political
candidates.
the
congress
has
further
provided
that
licensees
shall
hold
their
licenses
for
three
years.
it's
charge
the
commission
to
use
the
standard
of
the
public
interest
in
renewing
licenses
and
it
has
provided
in
section
3
(r)
as
this
court
quoted
in
the
red
lion
opinion,
a
mandate
to
the
commission
from
time
to
time
as
public
convenience,
interest
or
necessity
requires
to
promulgate
such
rules
and
regulations,
and
prescribe
such
restrictions,
and
conditions
as
maybe
necessary
to
carryout
the
provisions
of
this
chapter.
in
carrying
out
this
charge,
the
commission
has
developed
the
reply
to
attack
rule
and
the
fairness
doctrine,
both
of
which
work
upheld
by
this
court
in
red
lion.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
think
their
position
might
be
different.
i
think
i
would
rather
have
them
speak
for
themselves.
i'm
not
at
all
sure
though
that
if
this
court
had
held
that
the
fairness
doctrine
was
invalid
as
a
--
an
undue
interference
in
violation
of
the
first
amendment
rights
of
the
broadcasters
that
it
wouldn't
almost
be
a
fortiorari
case
to
say
that
--
that
they
would
have
no
rights
here.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no,
mr.
justice.
i
don't
think
it's
that
they
are
reluctant
to.
i
think
it
is
that
they
feel
it
is
not
necessary
and
that
the
“first
amendment
value”
involved
in
the
picture
is
adequately
taken
care
of
by
the
fairness
act.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
what
it
is,
i
think
it
is
to
a
very
considerable
extent.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
think
the
--
i
think
that
as
commissioner
johnson
said
in
his
dissenting
opinion,
i
think
it
pretty
much
involves
the
abolition
of
the
fairness
doctrine.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
it
is
certainly
a
very
large
element
in
the
overall
picture.
now,
i
don't
understand
that
red
lion
was
a
constitutional
case
in
the
sense
that
it
decided
that
the
fairness
doctrine
was
required
by
the
first
amendment.
on
the
contrary
it
was,
as
i
see
it,
an
administrative
law
case
holding
that
the
commission
under
the
authority
granted
to
it
by
congress
and
the
power
to,
just
have
the
power
to
establish
the
fairness
doctrine
and
congress
had
the
power
to
ratify
it
in
1959.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
and
as
far
as
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
as
far
as
the
constitution
was
involved
that
there
was
nothing
in
the
first
amendment
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
--
which
made
the
fairness
doctrine
invalid.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
that
seems
to
me
it
was
a
--
it
was
a
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
whether
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
--
whether
congress
was
prevented
from
treating
this
as
an
administrative
doctrine
because
of
the
first
amendment.
there
is
no
suggestion
that
the
stations
involved
in
this
case
do
not
comply
with
the
fairness
doctrine.
they
do
present
discussions
of
controversial
and
political
issues.
the
question
is
whether
they
must
nevertheless
takes
spot
announcements
and
perhaps
put
on
programs
on
public
interest
--
issues
from
anyone
who
wants
to
pay
for
the
time.
and
then
very
likely
pursuant
to
the
fairness
doctrine
have
to
allow
free
time
to
those
who
want
to
present
the
other
side,
if
no
one
can
be
found
for
the
presentation
of
the
other
point
of
view.
it's
hard
to
think
of
anything
which
more
effectively
destroys
the
freedom
and
control
of
the
broadcasters
often
called
the
electronic
press.
it's
likewise
hard
to
think
that
the
public
will
be
well-served
by
a
system
which
makes
access
to
the
airways
on
controversial
issues,
depend
in
material
extent
on
who
has
the
money
to
pay
for
it.
and
perhaps
on
who
has
the
most
money
as
the
price
is
bid
up.
as
judge
mcgowan
said
in
the
court
below,
“that
approach
does
not
seem
to
me
to
be
a
promising
one
in
terms
of
the
public's
right
to
know.”
and
he
added,
“it
is
hardly
the
part
of
wisdom
to
scrap
our
present
system
of
private
broadcasting
for
a
system
in
which
money
alone
determines
what
items
are
to
be
aired
and
in
what
format.”
are
these
not
issues
of
the
sort
that
congress
should
determine
with
the
aid
of
the
agency
in
the
light
of
experience
and
without
premature
constitutional
restraint?
the
fairness
doctrine
has
been
developing
for
more
than
40
years.
this
has
been
done
under
the
watchful
eye
of
this
court
and
with
recognition,
as
this
court
said
in
the
pottsville
broadcasting
case,
that
the
administrative
process
should
possessed
sufficient
flexibility
to
adjust
itself
to
the
rapidly
fluctuating
factors,
character
--
characteristic
of
the
evolution
of
broadcasting.
through
the
fairness
doctrine
as
it
has
developed,
there
is
a
clear
duty
on
the
broadcaster,
but
he
is
still
a
private
businessman
as
a
part
of
a
deliberately
adopted
system
of
private
broadcasting,
and
he
is
not
only
free
but
obligated
to
exercise
his
journalistic
discretion.
they
considered
and
experienced
judgment
of
the
commission
that
this
is
not
a
situation
in
which
it
should
take
affirmative
action,
it
should
be
upheld
and
accordingly
the
judgment
below
should
be
reversed.
