mr.
j.
roger
wollenberg
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
appear
on
behalf
of
petitioner,
columbia
broadcasting
system.
i
--
i
think
that
the
able
arguments
which
have
proceeded
have
made
clear,
i
hope,
what
is
before
this
court
and
what
is
not
before
this
court.
as
we
see
it,
there
is
not
here
today
any
question
of
the
commission's
power
to
take
affirmative
action
in
the
access
area
if
it
should
on
appropriate
basis
determined
that
such
actions
was
necessary.
what
we
have
here
as
the
solicitor
general
has
made
clear,
a
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
which
through
the
enunciation
of
a
new
constitutional
doctrine
has
in
effect
resulted
in
a
substitution
of
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
that
of
the
agency
on
the
erroneous
premise
that
the
first
amendment
requires
the
government
to
compel
broadcasters
to
provide
paid
advertising
on
demand.
now,
i
should
like
to
make
clear
that
contrary
to
the
impression
that
the
solicitor
general
may
have
had
the
broadcast
petitioners
in
this
case
are
not
here
asking
for
a
ruling
by
this
court
that
would
limit
the
powers
of
the
commission.
what
we
are
asking
for
here
is
a
reversal
of
the
decision
below,
a
decision
which
creates
a
constitutional
straightjacket
that
binds
the
commission
and
indeed
the
congress
for
all
time.
mr.
j.
roger
wollenberg
no.
we
have
not
made
that
contention
your
honor.
the
solicitor
general
quoted
judge
mcgowan
and
i
think
what
--
mr.
j.
roger
wollenberg
and
let
me
say
your
honor
that
i
associate
myself
with
mr.
jennes'
statement
that
we
are
--
we
accept
red
lion
--
mr.
j.
roger
wollenberg
--
that
were
not
here
undercutting
red
lion
and
that
to
the
contrary,
we
suggest
that
the
trustee
fairness
scheme
created
by
congress
and
the
commission
and
upheld
in
red
lion
would
be
diminished,
hampered
and
frustrated
by
the
holding
of
the
court
below.
mr.
j.
roger
wollenberg
i
don't
know
your
honor
whether
i
would
use
the
word
“justification”
but
i
would
say
this,
that
the
broadcasters
having
been
told
very
clearly
in
the
pronouncements
of
the
commission
and
the
pronouncements
of
this
court
in
red
lion,
that
they
have
a
responsibility
to
achieve
fairness.
and
that
this
is
a
responsibility
not
only
to
present
the
varying
sides
of
issues
to
present
the
individual
views
of
representatives
spokesman
of
issues
and
--
but
not
only
those
two
but
also
to
affirmatively
see
that
they
cover
the
important
public
issues,
that
with
those
very
substantial
responsibilities
which
as
the
chief
justice
has
pointed
out
may
lead
to
a
denial
of
license,
if
you
do
not
carried
them
out.
with
those
very
substantial
or
responsibilities,
some
broadcasters,
not
all,
some
broadcasters
including
columbia
broadcasting
system
have
included
that
the
best
way
to
effectuate
and
implement,
and
carry
out
those
responsibilities
is
not
as
judge
mcgowan
said,
to
scrap
the
existing
mechanism
for
a
system
in
which
money
alone
determines
what
issues
are
to
be
aired.
in
other
words,
columbia
broadcasting
system
over
a
long
period
of
years
has
concluded
and
believes
from
its
experience
that
it
is
not
the
best
way
to
cover
issues
to
simply
sell
time
to
those
who
desire
to
and
are
able
to
purchase
time.
but
this
does
not
mean
that
everything
is
filtered
through
a
cbs
point
of
view
or
that
the
individual
views
of
representative
spokesman
are
not
given.
they
are
given
daily
in
--
in
news
broadcasts,
regularly
on
news
interview
programs
and
as
occasion
warrants,
at
extensively
and
directly,
for
example,
in
the
very
extensive
coverage
of
the
national
political
conventions.
so
it's
not
a
matter
of
declining
to
what
people
speak
through
their
own
mouths.
it
is
a
matter
of
attempting
to
plan,
to
organize
so
as
to
achieve
these
heavy
responsibilities
of
covering
issues
providing
information
for
the
public,
providing
balance,
providing
the
various
sides.
mr.
j.
roger
wollenberg
it
is
our
position
which
i
hope
to
get
into
--
mr.
j.
roger
wollenberg
--
a
little
greater
length
after
the
lunch
and
recess,
but
it
is
our
position
that
there
is
not
state
action
here
and
that
their
not
being
state
action
that
--
that
is
an
alternative
ground
for
reversal
of
the
judgment
below
because
the
first
amendment
question
does
not
arise
unless
there
is
state
action.
it
is
our
view
that
for
the
reasons
that
we
set
forth
at
some
length
in
our
opening
brief,
that
even
prior
to
the
last
term
that
the
standards
properly
applied
for
state
action
before
governmental
intervention
or
governmental
involvement
rises
to
the
constitutional
place
of
state
action,
there
must
be
a
compulsion,
an
inducement,
a
participation.
those
are
catchwords
but
they
--
they
summarize
the
areas.we
made
those
points
in
our
opening
brief.
in
our
reply
brief
we
pointed
out
that
we
think
that
the
attenuated
reliance
of
the
court
below
on
some
general
language
in
burton
and
wilmington,
and
the
public
utilities
commission
against
pollak,
but
that
reliance
was
misplaced
in
light
of
the
decision
of
this
court
at
the
last
term
in
moose
lodge.
mr.
j.
roger
wollenberg
before
attempting
a
response
to
the
open
book
examination
question
that
was
left
with
me
at
the
recess
and
completing
my
--
my
discussion
with
state
action.
i
would
like
to
emphasize
again,
there
must
not
be
any
misunderstanding
on
what
we
are
not
contending.
we
are
not
contending
on
the
basis
of
our
state
action
argument
that
the
lack
of
state
action,
as
we
see
it,
takes
this
area
outside
of
the
power
of
the
federal
communications
commission.
we
are
arguing
that
there
is
not
the
state
action
that
gives
rise
to
a
constitutional
right
on
the
--
in
the
respondents
to
demand
a
system
which
judge
mcgowan
has
correctly
described
as
a
constitutional
straightjacket.
now,
with
respect
to
mr.
justice
stewart's
question,
let
me
say
first
that
i
don't
think
that
any
possible
shades
of
difference
in
standards
would
be
controlling
or
indeed
material
here
because
i
think
by
any
standards
that
there
is
a
lack
of
state
action,
but
on
this
specific
question
of
the
equal
protection
clause,
state
action
standard
versus
the
first
amendment
standard.
i
think
that
if
there
is
a
difference,
it
isn't
the
difference
between
the
two
amendments,
but
it
is
the
difference
perhaps
between
the
equal
protection
clause
as
applied
in
racial
discrimination
kind
of
cases
and
other
cases
whether
they'd
be
a
first
amendment
or
equal
protection.
i
think
that
the
long
history
of
the
equal
protection
clause
and
the
enactment
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
to
give
force
to
the
civil
rights
cases,
civil
rights
acts
in
case
they
should
be
declared
unconstitutional
that
the
adoption
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
was
designed,
not
only
to
end
historic
policies
of
state
action
to
enforcement
segregation
and
enforce
different
treatment
onto
the
blacks.
but
it
was
also
designed
to
assure
that
no
private
action
under
the
color
of
state
law
should
achieve
that
effect.
so,
i
think
that
there
is
a
special
consideration
that
applies
in
the
racial
cases.
now,
i
said
before
the
lunch
and
recess
that
we
think
that
the
cases
before
moose
lodge
established
the
correctness
of
our
position
that
moose
lodge
merely
reaffirms
it.
we
have
briefed
the
question
rather
extensively
in
our
opening
brief
and
in
our
reply
brief,
and
because
of
limitations
of
time,
i
should
like
simply
to
say
why
in
this
particular
situation
we
don't
think
you
have
any
kind
of
government
participation
encouragement,
compulsion
or
approval.
a
close
reading
of
the
commission's
very
thoughtful
and
articulate
opinion
in
these
cases
makes
clear
that
the
commission
was
not
saying
that
it
didn't
want
broadcasters
to
sell
time
for
controversial
issues,
to
sell
advertising
time.
it
wasn't
saying
that
it
approved
broadcasters
who
do
that
and
would
be
more
likely
to
renew
their
licenses
in
those
who
sold
such
time.
the
commission
wasn't
telling
broadcasters
what
to
do.
what
the
commission
was
saying,
and
i
think
very
correctly
was,
that
it
would
be
inappropriate
for
it
to
issue
an
order
of
compulsion
to
broadcasters
because
it
would
interfere
with
their
ability
to
carry
forth
their
trustee
responsibility
of
achieving
a
fairness
doctrine
in
their
own
way,
and
it
might
indeed
impede
it.
and
those
who
wished
to
sell
advertising
time
may
do
so
but
they
still
have
the
responsibility
of
carrying
out
the
fairness
doctrine
and
those
who
wished
not
to
may
do
so,
but
they
still
have
the
responsibility
of
carrying
out
the
fairness
doctrine
including
that
portion
of
the
fairness
doctrine
which
requires
that
partisan
views
be
given
expression
and
that
--
and
not
be
filtered
out
in
the
presentation
process.
mr.
j.
roger
wollenberg
well,
of
course,
in
moose
lodge
at
least
one
dissent
argued
that
the
number
of
liquor
licenses
were
limited
in
--
in
the
state.
but
it
is
perfectly
true
that
you
have
a
licensees
here
and
that
the
broadcasters
can
only
broadcast
if
they
hold
licenses,
but
it
is
also
true
that
the
congressional
and
commission
regime
that
was
upheld
in
red
lion
answered
that
scarcity
and
limited
number
of
licensees
by
placing
on
the
broadcasters
a
heavy
kind
of
responsibility.
the
newspapers
for
example,
do
not
have
and
instead
fairness
doctrine
responsibility,
and
that
implementation
of
the
public's
right
to
know
which
is
the
first
amendment
interest
that
was
stressed
in
red
lion,
not
the
right
of
an
individual
to
get
on
the
mic,
because
there
are
a
limited
number
of
hours,
limited
number
days,
limited
number
of
stations,
but
the
right
of
the
public
to
know
and
the
--
this
court
unanimously
in
red
lion
held
that
the
regime
adopted
by
congress
and
the
commission
of
--
of
assuring
the
public's
right
to
know
would
be
satisfied
or
was
illegitimate
on
a
reasonable
scheme.
what
we're
arguing
here
is
that
the
decision
below,
as
the
commission
said
by
compelling
a
particular
type
of
activity
would
frustrate
and
interfere
with
that
responsibility.
and
turning
now
to
one
of
the
principal
contentions
of
the
respondents,
and
the
holding
of
the
court
below,
there
is
some
kind
of
a
constitutional
invidious
discrimination
involved
in
the
practice
that
the
commission
has
declined
to
prohibit.
and
whether
you
call
this
a
first
amendment
violation
or
an
equal
protection
violation,
the
contention
is
that
if
you
sell
time
for
a
commercial
advertisement
--
advertising
time,
you
cannot
refuse
to
the
sale
of
time
for
controversial
speech.
now,
we
suggest
that
that
is
not
a
valid
contention.
we
suggest
that
commercial
matter
and
controversial
issue
matter
are
treated
very
differently
under
the
act
because
of
the
affirmative
responsibility
under
the
fairness
doctrine
of
red
lion
as
i've
mentioned
to
cover
controversial
issues,
so
that
the
broadcaster
who
won't
let
the
controversial
issue
into
his
advertising
time,
also
keeps
the
--
the
--
a
commercial
broadcaster
out
of
his
program
time.
the
commission
will
not
allow
broadcasters
to
have
a
program
like
the
commercials.so
that
what
actually
happens
is
that
under
the
scheme
of
the
act
and
the
commission's
rules,
a
controversial
speech
is
given
a
preferred
position
as
against
commercials
speech.
now,
this
doesn't
mean
that
any
individual
has
the
right
to
come
in
and
demand
that
he
can
put
on
a
commercial,
no
individual
has
a
right
to
demand
that
he
come
and
--
and
be
given
time
on
the
air.
in
both
cases,
the
broadcaster
exercises
discretion.
the
cases
which
have
been
relied
upon
by
the
respondents
in
the
court
below,
we
submit,
are
not
controlling.
there
are
lower
court
cases
dealing
with
busses
where
you
have
no
system
of
information
other
than
the
advertising
space
and
a
state,
a
supporter
or
state
partially
supported
newspapers.
and
then
the
newspaper
cases
there's
a
conflict
with
the
evans
and
richter's
case
in
the
third
circuit
which
says,
there's
no
right
of
access
to
a
journalistic
media
even
though
it's
supported
by
the
state.
we
think
that
those
cases
are
not
in
point
here,
what
is
in
point
here
is
that
there's
a
reasonable
classification,
if
you
will,
a
reasonable
determination
was
made
by
the
--
been
made
by
the
broadcasters
in
which
the
agency
charge
with
expertise
in
the
field
has
found
to
be
not
unreasonable,
if
the
broadcaster
wants
to
do
it
that
way
as
a
message
of
achieving
his
fairness
obligations.
one
final
point
mr.
jennes
emphasized
at
some
of
the
--
the
dangers
of
an
unrestricted
right
of
purchase
of
time.
and
he
pointed
out
that
that
isn't
just
the
organizations
that
are
registered
in
getting
on,
but
we
also
have
commercial
advertisers.
now,
there's
about
a
billion
and
a
half
dollars
of
network,
television,
commercial
advertising
sales
during
the
course
of
the
year
and
if
--
if
you
say
that
there's
a
constitutional
right
to
put
into
your
advertisements,
controversial
issue
matter
then
presumably
that
billion
and
half
dollars
of
commercial
advertising
can
include
as
much
as
any
given
commercial
advertiser
desires
to
do.
most
broadcasters
today
make
an
effort
not
to
include
in
their
commercial
advertising
such
materials.
now
you've
been
pointed
two
examples
of
cases
where
broadcasters
have
not
complied
without
or
cases
where
the
line
has
been
--
has
been
crossed,
and
what
appear
to
be
a
product
commercial
swapped
over
into
an
advocacy
of
a
position.
and
in
that
case
the
fairness
doctrine
applies.
but
most
broadcasters
today
make
the
effort
to
make
that
distinction.
i
think
it's
a
very
important
distinction
because
i
think
that
the
--
in
agenda
would
indeed
as
the
commission
said
the
--
as
set
by
the
affluent
if
we
set
up
a
constitutional
principle
of
this
kind,
and
i
don't
think
that
the
any
amount
of
balancing
by
the
broadcaster
could
unskew
what
have
been
skewed
in
that
fashion.
mr.
j.
roger
wollenberg
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
appear
on
behalf
of
petitioner,
columbia
broadcasting
system.
i
--
i
think
that
the
able
arguments
which
have
proceeded
have
made
clear,
i
hope,
what
is
before
this
court
and
what
is
not
before
this
court.
as
we
see
it,
there
is
not
here
today
any
question
of
the
commission's
power
to
take
affirmative
action
in
the
access
area
if
it
should
on
appropriate
basis
determined
that
such
actions
was
necessary.
what
we
have
here
as
the
solicitor
general
has
made
clear,
a
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
which
through
the
enunciation
of
a
new
constitutional
doctrine
has
in
effect
resulted
in
a
substitution
of
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
that
of
the
agency
on
the
erroneous
premise
that
the
first
amendment
requires
the
government
to
compel
broadcasters
to
provide
paid
advertising
on
demand.
now,
i
should
like
to
make
clear
that
contrary
to
the
impression
that
the
solicitor
general
may
have
had
the
broadcast
petitioners
in
this
case
are
not
here
asking
for
a
ruling
by
this
court
that
would
limit
the
powers
of
the
commission.
what
we
are
asking
for
here
is
a
reversal
of
the
decision
below,
a
decision
which
creates
a
constitutional
straightjacket
that
binds
the
commission
and
indeed
the
congress
for
all
time.
mr.
j.
roger
wollenberg
no.
we
have
not
made
that
contention
your
honor.
the
solicitor
general
quoted
judge
mcgowan
and
i
think
what
--
mr.
j.
roger
wollenberg
and
let
me
say
your
honor
that
i
associate
myself
with
mr.
jennes'
statement
that
we
are
--
we
accept
red
lion
--
mr.
j.
roger
wollenberg
--
that
were
not
here
undercutting
red
lion
and
that
to
the
contrary,
we
suggest
that
the
trustee
fairness
scheme
created
by
congress
and
the
commission
and
upheld
in
red
lion
would
be
diminished,
hampered
and
frustrated
by
the
holding
of
the
court
below.
mr.
j.
roger
wollenberg
i
don't
know
your
honor
whether
i
would
use
the
word
“justification”
but
i
would
say
this,
that
the
broadcasters
having
been
told
very
clearly
in
the
pronouncements
of
the
commission
and
the
pronouncements
of
this
court
in
red
lion,
that
they
have
a
responsibility
to
achieve
fairness.
and
that
this
is
a
responsibility
not
only
to
present
the
varying
sides
of
issues
to
present
the
individual
views
of
representatives
spokesman
of
issues
and
--
but
not
only
those
two
but
also
to
affirmatively
see
that
they
cover
the
important
public
issues,
that
with
those
very
substantial
responsibilities
which
as
the
chief
justice
has
pointed
out
may
lead
to
a
denial
of
license,
if
you
do
not
carried
them
out.
with
those
very
substantial
or
responsibilities,
some
broadcasters,
not
all,
some
broadcasters
including
columbia
broadcasting
system
have
included
that
the
best
way
to
effectuate
and
implement,
and
carry
out
those
responsibilities
is
not
as
judge
mcgowan
said,
to
scrap
the
existing
mechanism
for
a
system
in
which
money
alone
determines
what
issues
are
to
be
aired.
in
other
words,
columbia
broadcasting
system
over
a
long
period
of
years
has
concluded
and
believes
from
its
experience
that
it
is
not
the
best
way
to
cover
issues
to
simply
sell
time
to
those
who
desire
to
and
are
able
to
purchase
time.
but
this
does
not
mean
that
everything
is
filtered
through
a
cbs
point
of
view
or
that
the
individual
views
of
representative
spokesman
are
not
given.
they
are
given
daily
in
--
in
news
broadcasts,
regularly
on
news
interview
programs
and
as
occasion
warrants,
at
extensively
and
directly,
for
example,
in
the
very
extensive
coverage
of
the
national
political
conventions.
so
it's
not
a
matter
of
declining
to
what
people
speak
through
their
own
mouths.
it
is
a
matter
of
attempting
to
plan,
to
organize
so
as
to
achieve
these
heavy
responsibilities
of
covering
issues
providing
information
for
the
public,
providing
balance,
providing
the
various
sides.
mr.
j.
roger
wollenberg
it
is
our
position
which
i
hope
to
get
into
--
mr.
j.
roger
wollenberg
--
a
little
greater
length
after
the
lunch
and
recess,
but
it
is
our
position
that
there
is
not
state
action
here
and
that
their
not
being
state
action
that
--
that
is
an
alternative
ground
for
reversal
of
the
judgment
below
because
the
first
amendment
question
does
not
arise
unless
there
is
state
action.
it
is
our
view
that
for
the
reasons
that
we
set
forth
at
some
length
in
our
opening
brief,
that
even
prior
to
the
last
term
that
the
standards
properly
applied
for
state
action
before
governmental
intervention
or
governmental
involvement
rises
to
the
constitutional
place
of
state
action,
there
must
be
a
compulsion,
an
inducement,
a
participation.
those
are
catchwords
but
they
--
they
summarize
the
areas.we
made
those
points
in
our
opening
brief.
in
our
reply
brief
we
pointed
out
that
we
think
that
the
attenuated
reliance
of
the
court
below
on
some
general
language
in
burton
and
wilmington,
and
the
public
utilities
commission
against
pollak,
but
that
reliance
was
misplaced
in
light
of
the
decision
of
this
court
at
the
last
term
in
moose
lodge.
mr.
j.
roger
wollenberg
before
attempting
a
response
to
the
open
book
examination
question
that
was
left
with
me
at
the
recess
and
completing
my
--
my
discussion
with
state
action.
i
would
like
to
emphasize
again,
there
must
not
be
any
misunderstanding
on
what
we
are
not
contending.
we
are
not
contending
on
the
basis
of
our
state
action
argument
that
the
lack
of
state
action,
as
we
see
it,
takes
this
area
outside
of
the
power
of
the
federal
communications
commission.
we
are
arguing
that
there
is
not
the
state
action
that
gives
rise
to
a
constitutional
right
on
the
--
in
the
respondents
to
demand
a
system
which
judge
mcgowan
has
correctly
described
as
a
constitutional
straightjacket.
now,
with
respect
to
mr.
justice
stewart's
question,
let
me
say
first
that
i
don't
think
that
any
possible
shades
of
difference
in
standards
would
be
controlling
or
indeed
material
here
because
i
think
by
any
standards
that
there
is
a
lack
of
state
action,
but
on
this
specific
question
of
the
equal
protection
clause,
state
action
standard
versus
the
first
amendment
standard.
i
think
that
if
there
is
a
difference,
it
isn't
the
difference
between
the
two
amendments,
but
it
is
the
difference
perhaps
between
the
equal
protection
clause
as
applied
in
racial
discrimination
kind
of
cases
and
other
cases
whether
they'd
be
a
first
amendment
or
equal
protection.
i
think
that
the
long
history
of
the
equal
protection
clause
and
the
enactment
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
to
give
force
to
the
civil
rights
cases,
civil
rights
acts
in
case
they
should
be
declared
unconstitutional
that
the
adoption
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
was
designed,
not
only
to
end
historic
policies
of
state
action
to
enforcement
segregation
and
enforce
different
treatment
onto
the
blacks.
but
it
was
also
designed
to
assure
that
no
private
action
under
the
color
of
state
law
should
achieve
that
effect.
so,
i
think
that
there
is
a
special
consideration
that
applies
in
the
racial
cases.
now,
i
said
before
the
lunch
and
recess
that
we
think
that
the
cases
before
moose
lodge
established
the
correctness
of
our
position
that
moose
lodge
merely
reaffirms
it.
we
have
briefed
the
question
rather
extensively
in
our
opening
brief
and
in
our
reply
brief,
and
because
of
limitations
of
time,
i
should
like
simply
to
say
why
in
this
particular
situation
we
don't
think
you
have
any
kind
of
government
participation
encouragement,
compulsion
or
approval.
a
close
reading
of
the
commission's
very
thoughtful
and
articulate
opinion
in
these
cases
makes
clear
that
the
commission
was
not
saying
that
it
didn't
want
broadcasters
to
sell
time
for
controversial
issues,
to
sell
advertising
time.
it
wasn't
saying
that
it
approved
broadcasters
who
do
that
and
would
be
more
likely
to
renew
their
licenses
in
those
who
sold
such
time.
the
commission
wasn't
telling
broadcasters
what
to
do.
what
the
commission
was
saying,
and
i
think
very
correctly
was,
that
it
would
be
inappropriate
for
it
to
issue
an
order
of
compulsion
to
broadcasters
because
it
would
interfere
with
their
ability
to
carry
forth
their
trustee
responsibility
of
achieving
a
fairness
doctrine
in
their
own
way,
and
it
might
indeed
impede
it.
and
those
who
wished
to
sell
advertising
time
may
do
so
but
they
still
have
the
responsibility
of
carrying
out
the
fairness
doctrine
and
those
who
wished
not
to
may
do
so,
but
they
still
have
the
responsibility
of
carrying
out
the
fairness
doctrine
including
that
portion
of
the
fairness
doctrine
which
requires
that
partisan
views
be
given
expression
and
that
--
and
not
be
filtered
out
in
the
presentation
process.
mr.
j.
roger
wollenberg
well,
of
course,
in
moose
lodge
at
least
one
dissent
argued
that
the
number
of
liquor
licenses
were
limited
in
--
in
the
state.
but
it
is
perfectly
true
that
you
have
a
licensees
here
and
that
the
broadcasters
can
only
broadcast
if
they
hold
licenses,
but
it
is
also
true
that
the
congressional
and
commission
regime
that
was
upheld
in
red
lion
answered
that
scarcity
and
limited
number
of
licensees
by
placing
on
the
broadcasters
a
heavy
kind
of
responsibility.
the
newspapers
for
example,
do
not
have
and
instead
fairness
doctrine
responsibility,
and
that
implementation
of
the
public's
right
to
know
which
is
the
first
amendment
interest
that
was
stressed
in
red
lion,
not
the
right
of
an
individual
to
get
on
the
mic,
because
there
are
a
limited
number
of
hours,
limited
number
days,
limited
number
of
stations,
but
the
right
of
the
public
to
know
and
the
--
this
court
unanimously
in
red
lion
held
that
the
regime
adopted
by
congress
and
the
commission
of
--
of
assuring
the
public's
right
to
know
would
be
satisfied
or
was
illegitimate
on
a
reasonable
scheme.
what
we're
arguing
here
is
that
the
decision
below,
as
the
commission
said
by
compelling
a
particular
type
of
activity
would
frustrate
and
interfere
with
that
responsibility.
and
turning
now
to
one
of
the
principal
contentions
of
the
respondents,
and
the
holding
of
the
court
below,
there
is
some
kind
of
a
constitutional
invidious
discrimination
involved
in
the
practice
that
the
commission
has
declined
to
prohibit.
and
whether
you
call
this
a
first
amendment
violation
or
an
equal
protection
violation,
the
contention
is
that
if
you
sell
time
for
a
commercial
advertisement
--
advertising
time,
you
cannot
refuse
to
the
sale
of
time
for
controversial
speech.
now,
we
suggest
that
that
is
not
a
valid
contention.
we
suggest
that
commercial
matter
and
controversial
issue
matter
are
treated
very
differently
under
the
act
because
of
the
affirmative
responsibility
under
the
fairness
doctrine
of
red
lion
as
i've
mentioned
to
cover
controversial
issues,
so
that
the
broadcaster
who
won't
let
the
controversial
issue
into
his
advertising
time,
also
keeps
the
--
the
--
a
commercial
broadcaster
out
of
his
program
time.
the
commission
will
not
allow
broadcasters
to
have
a
program
like
the
commercials.so
that
what
actually
happens
is
that
under
the
scheme
of
the
act
and
the
commission's
rules,
a
controversial
speech
is
given
a
preferred
position
as
against
commercials
speech.
now,
this
doesn't
mean
that
any
individual
has
the
right
to
come
in
and
demand
that
he
can
put
on
a
commercial,
no
individual
has
a
right
to
demand
that
he
come
and
--
and
be
given
time
on
the
air.
in
both
cases,
the
broadcaster
exercises
discretion.
the
cases
which
have
been
relied
upon
by
the
respondents
in
the
court
below,
we
submit,
are
not
controlling.
there
are
lower
court
cases
dealing
with
busses
where
you
have
no
system
of
information
other
than
the
advertising
space
and
a
state,
a
supporter
or
state
partially
supported
newspapers.
and
then
the
newspaper
cases
there's
a
conflict
with
the
evans
and
richter's
case
in
the
third
circuit
which
says,
there's
no
right
of
access
to
a
journalistic
media
even
though
it's
supported
by
the
state.
we
think
that
those
cases
are
not
in
point
here,
what
is
in
point
here
is
that
there's
a
reasonable
classification,
if
you
will,
a
reasonable
determination
was
made
by
the
--
been
made
by
the
broadcasters
in
which
the
agency
charge
with
expertise
in
the
field
has
found
to
be
not
unreasonable,
if
the
broadcaster
wants
to
do
it
that
way
as
a
message
of
achieving
his
fairness
obligations.
one
final
point
mr.
jennes
emphasized
at
some
of
the
--
the
dangers
of
an
unrestricted
right
of
purchase
of
time.
and
he
pointed
out
that
that
isn't
just
the
organizations
that
are
registered
in
getting
on,
but
we
also
have
commercial
advertisers.
now,
there's
about
a
billion
and
a
half
dollars
of
network,
television,
commercial
advertising
sales
during
the
course
of
the
year
and
if
--
if
you
say
that
there's
a
constitutional
right
to
put
into
your
advertisements,
controversial
issue
matter
then
presumably
that
billion
and
half
dollars
of
commercial
advertising
can
include
as
much
as
any
given
commercial
advertiser
desires
to
do.
most
broadcasters
today
make
an
effort
not
to
include
in
their
commercial
advertising
such
materials.
now
you've
been
pointed
two
examples
of
cases
where
broadcasters
have
not
complied
without
or
cases
where
the
line
has
been
--
has
been
crossed,
and
what
appear
to
be
a
product
commercial
swapped
over
into
an
advocacy
of
a
position.
and
in
that
case
the
fairness
doctrine
applies.
but
most
broadcasters
today
make
the
effort
to
make
that
distinction.
i
think
it's
a
very
important
distinction
because
i
think
that
the
--
in
agenda
would
indeed
as
the
commission
said
the
--
as
set
by
the
affluent
if
we
set
up
a
constitutional
principle
of
this
kind,
and
i
don't
think
that
the
any
amount
of
balancing
by
the
broadcaster
could
unskew
what
have
been
skewed
in
that
fashion.
