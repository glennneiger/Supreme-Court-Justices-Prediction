justice
william

you
don't
then
content
that
your
--
your
client's
constitutional
rights
were
violated
by
the
decision
below.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
wollenberg,
don't
you
at
least
have
this
difference
between
lloyd
and
moose
lodge
on
the
one
hand,
and
the
situation
of
the
broadcaster
on
the
other
that
the
--
the
license
which
he
holds
is
really
a
--
a
form
of
profit.
it's
made
possible
only
by
governmental
exclusion
of
--
of
other
potential
broadcasters?
whereas,
it
is
my
recollection
of
both
lloyd
and
moose
was
that
--
that
the
private
individuals
were
dealing
with
their
own
private
property.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
it
that
clear
that
the
court
appeals
holding
was
statutory
as
well
as
constitutional,
mr.
califano?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
asher,
supposing
that
your
client's
claim
has
been
rejected
by
a
network
which
had
a
policy
of
selling
no
time
for
any
sort
of
advertising,
would
you
still
claim
a
first
amendment
denial
and
that
your
client
--
client
has
a
right
of
access
to
these
public
airwaves?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
can
--
can
you
really
make
that
serve
a
distinction
between
a
marketing
of
commercial
time
and
the
other
aspects
of
the
broadcasting
business
when
you're
trying
to
decide
whether
or
not
this
is
a
state
or
governmental
action?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
in
order
to
decide
whether
or
not
it's
governmental
action,
the
--
the
court
would
have
to
adapt
some
general
principle
not
just
to
say
that
in
these
two
particular
cases
its
governmental
action
and
we'll
worry
about
others
when
they
come
here.
i'm
wondering
whether
any
general
principle
could
be
applied
would
find
it
governmental
action
here
that
wouldn't
require
it
to
be
found
governmental
action
in
almost
every
other
facet
of
the
business.
