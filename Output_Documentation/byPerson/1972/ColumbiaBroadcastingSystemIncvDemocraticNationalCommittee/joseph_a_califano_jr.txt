mr.
joseph
a.
califano,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
will
deal
with
the
dnc
case
and
my
colleague
mr.
asher
will
deal
with
the
bem
case.
as
far
as
the
democratic
national
committee
is
concerned,
the
issue
before
this
court,
the
central
question,
the
same
central
question
we
began
dealing
with
--
with
the
networks
in
march
--
in
april
of
1970
and
with
the
fcc
in
the
late
spring
of
that
year.
it
is,
are
the
public
air
ways
which
are
the
most
powerful
and
forceful
means
of
communication
in
our
democratic
society
the
greatest
democracy
in
the
world
are
these
airways
to
be
used
to
promote
the
sale
of
soap,
deodorants,
mouth
washers,
and
brassieres,
and
not
to
promote
the
exchange
of
ideas.
and
the
legal
issue
is
whether
federal
communications
commission
consisted
with
the
communications
act
and
the
first
amendment
to
the
constitution
can
permit
the
three
major
networks,
and
the
7000
broadcasters
of
this
nation
to
impose
an
absolute
ban
on
all
radio
and
television
broadcasts
paid
for
by
the
major
political
parties
if
they
discussed
controversial
issues
of
public
importance.
the
rule
we
asked
for
is
a
very
simple
rule.
it
simply
requested
the
commission
and
i
quote
“that
a
broadcaster
may
not
as
general
policy
refuse
to
sell
time
to
responsible
entities
such
as
the
democratic
national
committee
for
the
solicitation
of
funds
and
for
comment
on
public
issues.
mr.
joseph
a.
califano,
jr.
your
honor
we'll
use
that
--
mr.
justice
we
used
that
phrase
in
the
rule
because
it
is
the
phrase
used
to
--
by
the
communications
industry
in
the
fcc
under
the
fairness
doctrine
and
--
where
they
present
an
editorial
view
on
one
side
and
say
that
responsible
spokesman
are
invited
to
answer
that
editorial
on
the
other
side.
mr.
joseph
a.
califano,
jr.
i
think
the
relevance
--
mr.
joseph
a.
califano,
jr.
no
your
--
no,
mr.
justice.
it
does
not
and
as
far
as
we
are
concerned
the
only
possible
difference
between
the
--
well,
i
might
--
let
met
put
it
this
way.
i
suppose
the
point
of
using
that
phrase
and
not
simply
asking
that
the
dnc
or
the
two
major
political
parties
be
granted
time
was
that
we
recognize
that
the
fcc
will
have
to
establish
some
reasonable
regulations
along
the
line.
mr.
joseph
a.
califano,
jr.
well,
the
--
mr.
chief
justice,
we
have
--
the
fairness
doctrine
would
still
operate
as
we
see
our
rule.
it
would
be
--
it
would
operate
along
side
of
it
and
to
the
extent
that
issues
were
not
covered
or
that
other
spokesman
wanted
to
deal
with
the
very
same
issue,
we
would
think
that
the
networks
should
indeed
permit
them
to
do
so.
in
--
in
response
to
the
question
whether
they
should
go
back
to
back
with
it,
we
have
argued
in
the
whole
series
of
other
matters
with
the
networks
and
with
the
communications
commission
about
that
right,
and
the
only
time
--
the
only
time
we've
ever
been
granted
that
was
when
senator
muskie
and
president
nixon
spoke
back
to
back
in
1970
on
election
eve.
aside
from
that,
we've
never
been
able
to
establish
that
as
a
right
and
i
have
to
say
that
i
don't
think
it's
--
it
recognizes
the
right
by
the
fcc
or
most
people
in
the
communication.
mr.
joseph
a.
califano,
jr.
well,
mr.
chief
justice,
yes,
that
--
that
is
certainly
one
way
to
do
it.
i
think
what
i'm
saying
is
that
it's
--
it
is
not
the
only
way,
there
are
probably
any
number
of
reasonable
solutions
the
commission
has
found
any
number
of
reasonable
solutions
to
deal
with
fairness
doctrine.
mr.
joseph
a.
califano,
jr.
yes
your
honor.
the
solicitor
general
stated
the
proceedings
below
and
i
will
not
repeat
them,
with
one
exception.
i
think
it's
important
to
note
that
the
federal
communications
commission
granted
part
of
the
dnc
request.
the
federal
communications
commission
said,
that
a
broadcaster
could
not
refuse
as
a
general
policy
to
accept
spot
announcements
for
the
solicitation
of
funds,
it
denied
the
rule
we
--
we
requested
insofar
as
that
rule
involved
the
discussion
of
controversial
issues
of
public
importance,
and
the
commission
opinion
below
in
no
way
attempted
to
tell
us
how
make
that
distinction
even
in
a
60-seconds
spot
soliciting
funds
for
a
political
party.
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed
the
federal
communications
commission
insofar
as
it
granted
us
the
right
to
purchase
spot
announcements
to
solicit
funds,
and
reversed
the
federal
communications
commission
holding
that
on
absolute
ban,
which
is
what
we
are
talking
about,
an
absolute
ban
by
the
broadcasters
and
the
networks
violated
the
communications
act
and
the
first
amendment
to
the
constitution.
mr.
joseph
a.
califano,
jr.
they
specifically
state
here,
mr.
justice
rehnquist
in
the
opinion
that
whether
--
whether
the
opinion
is
considered
based
on
the
communications
act
or
the
first
amendment
is
a
matter
of
little
influence
since
the
communications
act,
as
the
court
of
appeals
rather
incorporates
the
same
first
amendment
values.
the
broadcasters
and
the
fcc
opinion
blesses
their
attitude
in
this
case.
the
broadcasters
in
a
sense
and
precisely
are
saying
that
they
have
the
right
to
impose
an
absolute
ban,
that
they
can
explain
to
the
american
people,
what
the
views
of
the
democratic
party
are
or
what
the
views
of
the
republican
party
are
or
what
views
of
any
individual
spokesman
for
them
are,
better
than
that
spokesman
can
do
it
themselves.
and
in
--
in
the
age
of
double
think
and
euphemistic
double
talk
that
we
live
in,
they
call
it
journalistic
intervention.
mr.
joseph
a.
califano,
jr.
they
say
that
--
mr.
joseph
a.
califano,
jr.
yes,
mr.
justice.
they
would
be,
but
they're
--
but
they're
not
(voice
overlap)
mr.
joseph
a.
califano,
jr.
newspapers
as
if
--
mr.
joseph
a.
califano,
jr.
yes.
it
would
be
right
--
mr.
joseph
a.
califano,
jr.
--
prior
to
the
owner's
newspapers
would
have
that
right
and
i
might
note
that
that
is
precisely
a
point
that
the
solicitor
general
made
in
the
argument
he
made
on
the
red
lion
case.
he
distinguished
broadcasters
from
newspapers.
mr.
joseph
a.
califano,
jr.
that's
correct.
mr.
joseph
a.
califano,
jr.
that
is
their
first
(voice
overlap)
mr.
joseph
a.
califano,
jr.
that
--
that
is
correct,
mr.
justice
stewart.
mr.
joseph
a.
califano,
jr.
the
communications
act,
i
might
note
on
--
on
that
point
specifically
--
specifically
notes
in
section
301
that
the
fcc
which
grants
licenses
to
broadcasters
to
provide
for
the
use
of
such
channels
may
not
provide
for
the
ownership
of
those
channels
specifically
dealing
with
that
point.
newspapers
are
privately
owned,
the
channels
of
broadcasting,
broadcasting
is
--
is
about
as
regulated
as
any
industry
in
this
country
and
i
guess
the
point
might
as
well
for
a
moment
deal
with
the
questions
on
state
action.
as
far
as
we
are
concerned
as
we
have
laid
out
in
our
brief,
we
think
there
is
clearly
state
action
in
the
action
of
a
broadcaster.
there
is
a
federal
statute
involved
with
the
public
interest
standard.
the
federal
statute
preserves
the
public
ownership
of
the
airwaves
permitting
licenses
for
relatively
short
and
temporary
periods
of
time.
we
are
dealing
in
this
case
with
an
order
of
a
federal
regulatory
agency,
the
federal
communications
commission
which
in
turn
is
dealing
with
rights
of
exercise
over
public
property.
the
government
cannot
avoid
responsibility,
the
federal
government
for
orders
it
issues
simply
because
it
puts
them
in
permissive
terms,
and
to
sum
it
up
in
the
words
of
one
commentator
cited
in
our
brief,
the
federal
regulatory
system
is
as
much
responsible
for
the
existence
of
--
of
the
broadcasting
medium
as
the
bureau
of
engraving
is
responsible
for
the
existence
of
the
us
currency.
mr.
joseph
a.
califano,
jr.
yes
your
honor.
the
--
the
section
326
of
the
act
prohibits
the
commission
from
interfering
with
the
right
of
free
speech
by
means
of
radio
communication.
but
what
we
are
asking
for
is
not
that
the
broadcaster
or
the
commission
--
that
the
commission
start
saying
what
the
content
of
any
broadcaster's
program
might
be.
what
we
are
asking
for
is
that
the
broadcaster
be
required
to
recognize
our
first
amendment
right
to
have
some
access.
we
don't
ask
for
every
minute
of
everyday
and
--
and
experience
in
this
area
would
indicate
that
nobody
is
going
to
take
anything,
any
large
enormous
amounts
of
time.
something,
i
might
say,
in
the
legislative
history,
some
of
the
legislative
history
on
this
very
point
is
laid
out
in
our
brief.
the
fcc
already
in
effect,
regulates
something
about
spokesman
and
the
fairness
doctrine.
this
court
in
red
lion
has
recognized
that
some
spokesmen
at
least
when
they
are
personally
attacked
have
the
right
to
appear
on
television.
and
what
we
are
asking
for
is
not
inconsistent
with
what
the
fcc
said
a
generation
ago
and
in
1945
for
example,
in
the
united
broadcasting
case
which
involved
the
right
of
a
cooperative
or
a
labor
union
to
have
some
access
to
television.
i
quote
one
sentence
from
the
commission's
opinion,
“the
commission
is
of
the
opinion
that
the
operation
of
any
station
under
the
extreme
principles
that
no
time
shall
be
sold
for
the
discussion
of
controversial
public
issues
and
that
only
charitable
organizations
and
certain
commercial
interest
may
solicit
memberships
is
inconsistent
with
the
concept
of
public
interest
established
by
the
communications
act
as
the
criterion
for
radio
regulation.”
we
are
not
asking
for
--
for
anything
new
in
this
case.
there
are
other
cases
subsequent
to
that
which
in
fact
agree
with
it.
we
believe,
as
we
indicate
in
our
brief
that
this
case
can
be
decided
on
the
basis
of
the
communications
act
and
that
it
is
not
necessary
for
this
court
to
go
to
the
first
amendment
issue.
we
lay
out
our
analysis
of
the
legislative
history
of
the
early
communications'
opinions
of
section
326
of
the
communications
act
and
of
section
301.
as
far
as
the
common
carrier
point
which
is
made
only
briefly
here
in
all
argument
by
the
--
by
the
broadcasters
is
concerned,
we
would
note
simply
that
our
view
of
that
provision
is
that
it
was
designed
to
distinguish
telegraph
and
telephone
companies
which
are
handled
by
title
ii
of
the
communications
act
from
broadcasters
which
are
handled
by
title
iii.
and
moreover,
the
rule
we
ask
for
is
not
a
right
of
automatic
access
for
the
democratic
party
or
any
particular
individual.
this
--
it
--
it
recognizes
that
judgments
must
be
made,
but
we
believe
that
the
broadcasters
and
the
fcc
can
make
a
judgment
short
of
absolutely
banning
us
from
the
air.
with
respect
to
the
constitutional
points
--
mr.
joseph
a.
califano,
jr.
the
judgment
today
--
we
do
recognize
that
there
are
limited
numbers
of
hours
in
a
day.we
recognize
that
there
are
only
three
networks
in
this
country.
mr.
joseph
a.
califano,
jr.
we
recognize
that
most
communities
only
have
a
certain
number
--
a
relatively
small
number
of
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
joseph
a.
califano,
jr.
so
we
have
a
finite
spectrum.
mr.
joseph
a.
califano,
jr.
what
--
what
--
i'm
--
i'm
--
mr.
justice
stewart,
i'm
not
saying
it
in
those
terms.
what
i'm
--
what
i'm
saying
is
this
that
recognizing
we
have
a
finite
resource,
recognizing
as
this
court
did
in
red
lion
that
we
are
talking
about
--
because
of
that
in
some
sense
an
abridgeable
first
amendment
right
--
mr.
joseph
a.
califano,
jr.
well,
that's
the
language
of
the
unanimous
opinion
of
the
court.
mr.
joseph
a.
califano,
jr.
yes,
it
does.
but
the
--
but
the
--
but
the
writers
--
the
writers
of
the
first
amendment
--
well,
let
--
let
me
put
this
way.
i
think
we
--
we
have
to
deal
with
the
realities
of
a
--
of
a
medium
that
we
--
we
now
have.
the
realities
of
that
medium
are
that
it's
limited.
what
is
happening
today
is
that
broadcasters
are
simply
saying
if
you
--
if
you're
peddling
commercial
items,
you
have
a
right
to
buy
time.
if
you
want
to
peddle
political
ideas
or
political
parties,
you
have
no
right
to
buy
time.
and
we
say
that
there
is
something
less
than
that
kind
of
outrageous
discrimination
and
less
than
an
absolute
ban
that
the
broadcasters
can
operate
under.
i
think
that
it
--
you
know,
to
--
to
say
that
the
whole
broadcasting
system
will
collapse
if
this
court
or
anyone
opens
up
the
airwaves
to
people
or
political
parties
to
discuss
controversial
issues
is
contrary
to
all
the
experience
that
--
that
we
have.
the
--
the
newspapers
and
the
magazines
of
this
country
are
not
filled
with
political
advertisements.
the
corporations
that
advertise
their
television
sets,
and
their
automobiles,
and
their
department
stores,
and
their
grocery
items,
in
the
newspapers
of
this
country
have
not
taken
the
billions
and
billions
of
dollars
they
spent
in
newspapers
and
--
and
simply
turned
it
over
to
the
discussion
of
--
of
public
issues.
i
don't
think
there's
--
i
think
the
wealthy
man
is
--
is
a
straw
man
of
a
--
of
a
very
thin
proportions
and
i
think
that
anyone
that
has
attempted
to
--
to
find
this
wealthy
man
to
--
to
buy
television
time
for
the
discussion
of
controversial
issues
by
the
major
political
parties,
at
least,
and
i
would
dare
say
would
be
difficult
--
more
difficult
for
others
who
just
found
out
that
there's
not
a
barrel
of
money
out
there
waiting
to
be
spent.
we're
not
going
to
face
this
problem.we
do
have
to
recognize,
however,
the
broadcast
medium
is
a
limited
medium.
as
far
as
we
--
we
believe
that
the
red
lion
in
its
language,
we
believe
our
first
amendment
right
for
direct
communication
is
strong
and
involves
a
right
of
direct
communication.
we
think
there
is
no
substitute
for
that.
i
--
i
don't
think
anyone
in
this
chamber
could
believe
that
--
that
it
is
the
same
thing
to
have
walter
cronkite
or
john
chancellor
or
roger
mudd
explain
what
president
nixon
said
as
it
is
to
have
president
nixon
make
his
direct
appeal.
would
anyone
assert
that
if
--
if
walter
cronkite
had
laid
out
the
reasons
why
president
nixon
invaded
cambodia,
the
american
support
for
that
would
have
gone
from
five
percent
to
70%?
would
anyone
assert
that
there
is
some
journalistic
intervention
that
could
have
made
the
case
for
the
gulf
of
tonkin
resolution
of
president
johnson
more
effectively
that
he
could
have
made
it?should
the
broadcasters
or
mr.
wollenberg
or
mr.
jennes,
would
they
like
to
have
frank
reynolds
or
walter
cronkite
come
up
here
and
explain
what
they're
trying
to
tell
the
court?
the
point
is
that
this
is
the
medium
of
communication
in
this
country.
it
has
a
greater
impact
on
our
political
dialogue
and
our
electoral
system
than
any
other
form
available
to
any
person
or
party
in
this
country
and
we
simply
want
a
right
to
--
we
want
to
rule
that
simply
says
to
the
broadcasters,
“you
cannot
say
that
no
political
party
can
purchase
time
on
television
for
the
discussion
of
controversial
issues.”
mr.
joseph
a.
califano,
jr.
no.
your
honor,
we've
been
through
a
whole
series
of
--
of
rules
on
that.
there
are
a
variety
of
rules
in
that
area
right
now.
some
--
some
networks
and
stations
have
a
policy
which
says
that
during
election
periods
a
--
time
can
be
purchased
by
candidates
or
people
on
behalf
of
candidates.
mr.
joseph
a.
califano,
jr.
and
spot
announcements
may
be
purchase
during
those
periods.
but
outside
of
those
periods,
you
may
not
do
that.
mr.
joseph
a.
califano,
jr.
that's
correct.
the
rules
indeed
of
the
networks
in
this
case
changed
the
--
at
various
points
of
this
proceeding.
cbs
initially
took
the
position,
for
example,
that
they
would
not
sell
time
except
during
election
periods
and
then
only
to
candidates,
either
spot
time
or
--
or
programing
time
and
they
denied
us
programming
time.
three
months
later
when
the
fcc
after
we
filed
our
case,
cbs
said
they
would
change
the
rule
and
they
would
permit
spot
announcements
simply
to
raise
funds
but
not
to
discuss
controversial
issues.
eight
months
later
when
we
were
in
the
court
of
appeals,
cbs
said
that
it
would
now
permit
spot
announcements
for
us
to
discuss
controversial
issues,
announcements
of
60
seconds
or
less
and
to
raise
funds
but
no
more.
and
in
part,
i
might
say,
it
seems
to
us
that
it
is
not
--
you
know,
we
should
not
have
to
depend
on
how
cbs
executives
feel
on
any
given
morning
or
at
any
given
stage
of
a
legal
proceeding
as
to
what
our
rights
are
to
--
to
express
our
views
to
the
american
people
over
the
medium
that
95%
of
the
american
homes
find
as
their
greatest
source
of
information
and
news
in
this
country.
i
have
made
the
discrimination
point
in
terms
of
spot
announcements.
i
believe
the
same
kind
of
discrimination
exists
in
the
programming
area
as
we've
laid
out
below
and
here.
there
--
it
seems
to
me
that
--
that
all
--
all
programming,
people
can
buy
programming,
religious
organizations
can
buy
programming
but
the
--
the
two
major
political
parties
cannot
buy
programming.
mr.
joseph
a.
califano,
jr.
if
the
networks
sell
it.
mr.
joseph
a.
califano,
jr.
not
to
my
knowledge.
mr.
joseph
a.
califano,
jr.
well,
no.
and
mr.
justice
stewart,
their
right
to
absolutely
prohibit
this
kind
of
discussion.
mr.
joseph
a.
califano,
jr.
that's
--
that's
correct.
mr.
joseph
a.
califano,
jr.
that's
correct,
mr.
justice.
mr.
joseph
a.
califano,
jr.
oh,
you'd
have
a
much,
much
more
greater
situation.
mr.
joseph
a.
califano,
jr.
no.
that
is
not
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
joseph
a.
califano,
jr.
that
is
correct,
mr.
chief
justice.
there
are,
i
might
note,
according
to
the
census
bureau,
about
a
hundred
religions
in
this
country.
two
or
three
of
them
have
--
have
purchased
time
on
sunday
mornings
for
religious
shows
and
it
hasn't
destroyed
television
on
sunday.
the
other
95
haven't
come
bouncing
in
to
acquire
that
time.
some
corporations
are
--
are
affectively
granted
the
right
to
purchase
entire
amounts
of
time,
witness,
as
we
say
in
our
brief,
some
of
the
national
geographic
and
the
--
and
xerox
shows
that
have
appeared
on
the
air.
the
broadcasters
set
up
in
their
briefs
a
whole
chamber
of
horrors.
the
only
one
of
which
was
discussed
here
this
morning
was
the
wealthy
man,
a
straw
man,
which
--
with
which
i
have
dealt
briefly.
as
far
as
the
remaining
points
that
they
raised
about
administrative
difficulties,
i
would
urge
the
justices
of
this
court
or
their
clerks
to
review
the
briefs
in
the
red
lion
case
and
the
arguments
of
the
broadcasters
in
the
red
lion
case,
and
they
will
find
a
neat
and
remarkable
similarity
between
the
arguments
they
made
there
and
the
arguments
they
make
here
today
about
administrative
horror.
but
today,
cbs
in
its
brief
before
this
court
and
before
the
commission
and
the
court
of
appeal
says,
“their
public
issue
of
broadcasting
has
never
been
better.
it
improves
every
year
since
red
lion.”
so,
i
cannot,
with
all
due
respect,
give
and
i
do
not
think
this
court
should
give
just
as
the
court
of
appeals
do
not
give,
much
credence
to
this
administrative
horrors.
and
the
bottom-line
on
that
point,
i
submit,
mr.
justices
is
this,
in
red
lion,
in
the
unanimous
decision,
the
court
of
appeals
of
the
--
this
court
noted
that
it
would
not
decide
the
case
on
the
basis
of
extreme
possibilities
or
extreme
examples.
the
solicitor
general
indeed,
in
his
argument
in
red
lion
urged
that
particular
point
upon
this
court.
in
case
of
doubt,
this
court
opted
to
go
with
the
first
amendment
values
and
the
rights
of
free
speech,
noting
and
inviting
the
broadcasters
to
go
back
to
the
federal
communications
commission
and
ultimately
come
back
here
if
any
of
the
horrors
that
they
envision
--
envisioned
any
of
their
nightmares
ever
came
to
pass.
none
of
them
ever
did
come
to
pass
and
the
same
kind
of
doubt,
if
any
one
has
it,
in
this
room
besides
the
broadcasters
of
dangers
should
be
treated
in
the
same
kind
of
way
in
this
case.
we
believe
that
that
opting
for
free
speech
is
consistent
with
everything,
with
a
whole
host
of
decisions
of
this
court.
we
believe
that
this
court
and
in
effect,
opted
for
free
speech
and
the
(inaudible)
case
in
a
situation
of
dangerous,
explosive,
dirty,
and
outrageous
fighting
between
truckers
and
railroads.
in
times
v
sullivan,
this
court
opted
for
free
speech
in
a
situation
where
a
newspaper
lied.
in
the
pentagon
papers
this
court
opted
for
free
speech
even
though
the
national
security
of
this
country
might
have
been
involved.
in
this
case,
the
only
inhibition
on
opting
for
free
speech
or
a
host
of
possibles
that
the
network's
claim
may
come
to
pass
and
that
they
may
hurt
the
system
of
broadcasting.
i
think
that
in
this
--
mr.
joseph
a.
califano,
jr.
no,
but
in
their
--
in
their
opinion
they
--
they
expressed
explicit
agreement
with
the
--
with
the
several
of
the
problems.
mr.
joseph
a.
califano,
jr.
we
do
have
a
judgment
--
mr.
joseph
a.
califano,
jr.
yes,
we
do,
mr.
justice
white.
we
have
a
judgment
of
the
administrative
agency,
with
which
a
--
obviously,
we
disagree.
we
--
we
do
not
think
that
the
fcc
--
well,
we
have
two
judgments.
we
have
a
judgment
of
an
administrative
agency
which
says
“yes.
sell
them
spot
announcement
time.
that's
no
problem
--
mr.
joseph
a.
califano,
jr.
--
to
raise
funds.”
but
you
don't
have
to
sell
them
time
to
discuss
controversial
issues.
that
part
of
the
judgment
does
not
make
sense
to
us
in
the
sense
that,
i
do
not
think
it's
possible
for
a
major
political
party
to
advertise,
to
raise
funds
without
saying
something
about
some
issue
or
about
not
--
or
about
what
--
mr.
joseph
a.
califano,
jr.
--
it
stands
for.
mr.
joseph
a.
califano,
jr.
well,
i
was
--
i
think
that
the
--
the
provisions
of
the
communications
act
that
we
would
say
the
fcc
is
not
dealing
within
its
present
ruling
or
one,
the
fact
that
these
are
publicly
own
airwaves,
section
301.
number
two,
that
they
have
not
adequately
applied
the
public
interest
standard
that
in
connection
with
the
communications
area,
the
public
interest
standard
is
just
imbedding
in
first
amendment
considerations.
and
to
the
extent
that
first
amendment
considerations
are
imbedded
in
that
standard,
i
might
say
that
the
--
it
is
this
court
that
--
that
really
is
the
expert
in
the
first
amendment
and
not
the
fcc.
mr.
joseph
a.
califano,
jr.
the
--
no,
301,
the
public
interest
standard
which
is
involved
in
half
a
dozen
statutes
cited
to
half
dozens
sections
of
the
act
which
are
cited
on
our
brief,
relating
to
licensing
prescribing
service
and
a
whole
host
of
determinations
and
the
fact
that
in
--
in
the
federal
communications
act,
the
public
interest
standard
necessarily
does
involves
some
first
amendment
considerations
and
some
of
the
--
and
does
embody
some
the
public
policy
considerations
that
are
relevant
to
consideration
of
free
speech
values.
thank
you.
mr.
joseph
a.
califano,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
will
deal
with
the
dnc
case
and
my
colleague
mr.
asher
will
deal
with
the
bem
case.
as
far
as
the
democratic
national
committee
is
concerned,
the
issue
before
this
court,
the
central
question,
the
same
central
question
we
began
dealing
with
--
with
the
networks
in
march
--
in
april
of
1970
and
with
the
fcc
in
the
late
spring
of
that
year.
it
is,
are
the
public
air
ways
which
are
the
most
powerful
and
forceful
means
of
communication
in
our
democratic
society
the
greatest
democracy
in
the
world
are
these
airways
to
be
used
to
promote
the
sale
of
soap,
deodorants,
mouth
washers,
and
brassieres,
and
not
to
promote
the
exchange
of
ideas.
and
the
legal
issue
is
whether
federal
communications
commission
consisted
with
the
communications
act
and
the
first
amendment
to
the
constitution
can
permit
the
three
major
networks,
and
the
7000
broadcasters
of
this
nation
to
impose
an
absolute
ban
on
all
radio
and
television
broadcasts
paid
for
by
the
major
political
parties
if
they
discussed
controversial
issues
of
public
importance.
the
rule
we
asked
for
is
a
very
simple
rule.
it
simply
requested
the
commission
and
i
quote
“that
a
broadcaster
may
not
as
general
policy
refuse
to
sell
time
to
responsible
entities
such
as
the
democratic
national
committee
for
the
solicitation
of
funds
and
for
comment
on
public
issues.
mr.
joseph
a.
califano,
jr.
your
honor
we'll
use
that
--
mr.
justice
we
used
that
phrase
in
the
rule
because
it
is
the
phrase
used
to
--
by
the
communications
industry
in
the
fcc
under
the
fairness
doctrine
and
--
where
they
present
an
editorial
view
on
one
side
and
say
that
responsible
spokesman
are
invited
to
answer
that
editorial
on
the
other
side.
mr.
joseph
a.
califano,
jr.
i
think
the
relevance
--
mr.
joseph
a.
califano,
jr.
no
your
--
no,
mr.
justice.
it
does
not
and
as
far
as
we
are
concerned
the
only
possible
difference
between
the
--
well,
i
might
--
let
met
put
it
this
way.
i
suppose
the
point
of
using
that
phrase
and
not
simply
asking
that
the
dnc
or
the
two
major
political
parties
be
granted
time
was
that
we
recognize
that
the
fcc
will
have
to
establish
some
reasonable
regulations
along
the
line.
mr.
joseph
a.
califano,
jr.
well,
the
--
mr.
chief
justice,
we
have
--
the
fairness
doctrine
would
still
operate
as
we
see
our
rule.
it
would
be
--
it
would
operate
along
side
of
it
and
to
the
extent
that
issues
were
not
covered
or
that
other
spokesman
wanted
to
deal
with
the
very
same
issue,
we
would
think
that
the
networks
should
indeed
permit
them
to
do
so.
in
--
in
response
to
the
question
whether
they
should
go
back
to
back
with
it,
we
have
argued
in
the
whole
series
of
other
matters
with
the
networks
and
with
the
communications
commission
about
that
right,
and
the
only
time
--
the
only
time
we've
ever
been
granted
that
was
when
senator
muskie
and
president
nixon
spoke
back
to
back
in
1970
on
election
eve.
aside
from
that,
we've
never
been
able
to
establish
that
as
a
right
and
i
have
to
say
that
i
don't
think
it's
--
it
recognizes
the
right
by
the
fcc
or
most
people
in
the
communication.
mr.
joseph
a.
califano,
jr.
well,
mr.
chief
justice,
yes,
that
--
that
is
certainly
one
way
to
do
it.
i
think
what
i'm
saying
is
that
it's
--
it
is
not
the
only
way,
there
are
probably
any
number
of
reasonable
solutions
the
commission
has
found
any
number
of
reasonable
solutions
to
deal
with
fairness
doctrine.
mr.
joseph
a.
califano,
jr.
yes
your
honor.
the
solicitor
general
stated
the
proceedings
below
and
i
will
not
repeat
them,
with
one
exception.
i
think
it's
important
to
note
that
the
federal
communications
commission
granted
part
of
the
dnc
request.
the
federal
communications
commission
said,
that
a
broadcaster
could
not
refuse
as
a
general
policy
to
accept
spot
announcements
for
the
solicitation
of
funds,
it
denied
the
rule
we
--
we
requested
insofar
as
that
rule
involved
the
discussion
of
controversial
issues
of
public
importance,
and
the
commission
opinion
below
in
no
way
attempted
to
tell
us
how
make
that
distinction
even
in
a
60-seconds
spot
soliciting
funds
for
a
political
party.
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed
the
federal
communications
commission
insofar
as
it
granted
us
the
right
to
purchase
spot
announcements
to
solicit
funds,
and
reversed
the
federal
communications
commission
holding
that
on
absolute
ban,
which
is
what
we
are
talking
about,
an
absolute
ban
by
the
broadcasters
and
the
networks
violated
the
communications
act
and
the
first
amendment
to
the
constitution.
mr.
joseph
a.
califano,
jr.
they
specifically
state
here,
mr.
justice
rehnquist
in
the
opinion
that
whether
--
whether
the
opinion
is
considered
based
on
the
communications
act
or
the
first
amendment
is
a
matter
of
little
influence
since
the
communications
act,
as
the
court
of
appeals
rather
incorporates
the
same
first
amendment
values.
the
broadcasters
and
the
fcc
opinion
blesses
their
attitude
in
this
case.
the
broadcasters
in
a
sense
and
precisely
are
saying
that
they
have
the
right
to
impose
an
absolute
ban,
that
they
can
explain
to
the
american
people,
what
the
views
of
the
democratic
party
are
or
what
the
views
of
the
republican
party
are
or
what
views
of
any
individual
spokesman
for
them
are,
better
than
that
spokesman
can
do
it
themselves.
and
in
--
in
the
age
of
double
think
and
euphemistic
double
talk
that
we
live
in,
they
call
it
journalistic
intervention.
mr.
joseph
a.
califano,
jr.
they
say
that
--
mr.
joseph
a.
califano,
jr.
yes,
mr.
justice.
they
would
be,
but
they're
--
but
they're
not
(voice
overlap)
mr.
joseph
a.
califano,
jr.
newspapers
as
if
--
mr.
joseph
a.
califano,
jr.
yes.
it
would
be
right
--
mr.
joseph
a.
califano,
jr.
--
prior
to
the
owner's
newspapers
would
have
that
right
and
i
might
note
that
that
is
precisely
a
point
that
the
solicitor
general
made
in
the
argument
he
made
on
the
red
lion
case.
he
distinguished
broadcasters
from
newspapers.
mr.
joseph
a.
califano,
jr.
that's
correct.
mr.
joseph
a.
califano,
jr.
that
is
their
first
(voice
overlap)
mr.
joseph
a.
califano,
jr.
that
--
that
is
correct,
mr.
justice
stewart.
mr.
joseph
a.
califano,
jr.
the
communications
act,
i
might
note
on
--
on
that
point
specifically
--
specifically
notes
in
section
301
that
the
fcc
which
grants
licenses
to
broadcasters
to
provide
for
the
use
of
such
channels
may
not
provide
for
the
ownership
of
those
channels
specifically
dealing
with
that
point.
newspapers
are
privately
owned,
the
channels
of
broadcasting,
broadcasting
is
--
is
about
as
regulated
as
any
industry
in
this
country
and
i
guess
the
point
might
as
well
for
a
moment
deal
with
the
questions
on
state
action.
as
far
as
we
are
concerned
as
we
have
laid
out
in
our
brief,
we
think
there
is
clearly
state
action
in
the
action
of
a
broadcaster.
there
is
a
federal
statute
involved
with
the
public
interest
standard.
the
federal
statute
preserves
the
public
ownership
of
the
airwaves
permitting
licenses
for
relatively
short
and
temporary
periods
of
time.
we
are
dealing
in
this
case
with
an
order
of
a
federal
regulatory
agency,
the
federal
communications
commission
which
in
turn
is
dealing
with
rights
of
exercise
over
public
property.
the
government
cannot
avoid
responsibility,
the
federal
government
for
orders
it
issues
simply
because
it
puts
them
in
permissive
terms,
and
to
sum
it
up
in
the
words
of
one
commentator
cited
in
our
brief,
the
federal
regulatory
system
is
as
much
responsible
for
the
existence
of
--
of
the
broadcasting
medium
as
the
bureau
of
engraving
is
responsible
for
the
existence
of
the
us
currency.
mr.
joseph
a.
califano,
jr.
yes
your
honor.
the
--
the
section
326
of
the
act
prohibits
the
commission
from
interfering
with
the
right
of
free
speech
by
means
of
radio
communication.
but
what
we
are
asking
for
is
not
that
the
broadcaster
or
the
commission
--
that
the
commission
start
saying
what
the
content
of
any
broadcaster's
program
might
be.
what
we
are
asking
for
is
that
the
broadcaster
be
required
to
recognize
our
first
amendment
right
to
have
some
access.
we
don't
ask
for
every
minute
of
everyday
and
--
and
experience
in
this
area
would
indicate
that
nobody
is
going
to
take
anything,
any
large
enormous
amounts
of
time.
something,
i
might
say,
in
the
legislative
history,
some
of
the
legislative
history
on
this
very
point
is
laid
out
in
our
brief.
the
fcc
already
in
effect,
regulates
something
about
spokesman
and
the
fairness
doctrine.
this
court
in
red
lion
has
recognized
that
some
spokesmen
at
least
when
they
are
personally
attacked
have
the
right
to
appear
on
television.
and
what
we
are
asking
for
is
not
inconsistent
with
what
the
fcc
said
a
generation
ago
and
in
1945
for
example,
in
the
united
broadcasting
case
which
involved
the
right
of
a
cooperative
or
a
labor
union
to
have
some
access
to
television.
i
quote
one
sentence
from
the
commission's
opinion,
“the
commission
is
of
the
opinion
that
the
operation
of
any
station
under
the
extreme
principles
that
no
time
shall
be
sold
for
the
discussion
of
controversial
public
issues
and
that
only
charitable
organizations
and
certain
commercial
interest
may
solicit
memberships
is
inconsistent
with
the
concept
of
public
interest
established
by
the
communications
act
as
the
criterion
for
radio
regulation.”
we
are
not
asking
for
--
for
anything
new
in
this
case.
there
are
other
cases
subsequent
to
that
which
in
fact
agree
with
it.
we
believe,
as
we
indicate
in
our
brief
that
this
case
can
be
decided
on
the
basis
of
the
communications
act
and
that
it
is
not
necessary
for
this
court
to
go
to
the
first
amendment
issue.
we
lay
out
our
analysis
of
the
legislative
history
of
the
early
communications'
opinions
of
section
326
of
the
communications
act
and
of
section
301.
as
far
as
the
common
carrier
point
which
is
made
only
briefly
here
in
all
argument
by
the
--
by
the
broadcasters
is
concerned,
we
would
note
simply
that
our
view
of
that
provision
is
that
it
was
designed
to
distinguish
telegraph
and
telephone
companies
which
are
handled
by
title
ii
of
the
communications
act
from
broadcasters
which
are
handled
by
title
iii.
and
moreover,
the
rule
we
ask
for
is
not
a
right
of
automatic
access
for
the
democratic
party
or
any
particular
individual.
this
--
it
--
it
recognizes
that
judgments
must
be
made,
but
we
believe
that
the
broadcasters
and
the
fcc
can
make
a
judgment
short
of
absolutely
banning
us
from
the
air.
with
respect
to
the
constitutional
points
--
mr.
joseph
a.
califano,
jr.
the
judgment
today
--
we
do
recognize
that
there
are
limited
numbers
of
hours
in
a
day.we
recognize
that
there
are
only
three
networks
in
this
country.
mr.
joseph
a.
califano,
jr.
we
recognize
that
most
communities
only
have
a
certain
number
--
a
relatively
small
number
of
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
joseph
a.
califano,
jr.
so
we
have
a
finite
spectrum.
mr.
joseph
a.
califano,
jr.
what
--
what
--
i'm
--
i'm
--
mr.
justice
stewart,
i'm
not
saying
it
in
those
terms.
what
i'm
--
what
i'm
saying
is
this
that
recognizing
we
have
a
finite
resource,
recognizing
as
this
court
did
in
red
lion
that
we
are
talking
about
--
because
of
that
in
some
sense
an
abridgeable
first
amendment
right
--
mr.
joseph
a.
califano,
jr.
well,
that's
the
language
of
the
unanimous
opinion
of
the
court.
mr.
joseph
a.
califano,
jr.
yes,
it
does.
but
the
--
but
the
--
but
the
writers
--
the
writers
of
the
first
amendment
--
well,
let
--
let
me
put
this
way.
i
think
we
--
we
have
to
deal
with
the
realities
of
a
--
of
a
medium
that
we
--
we
now
have.
the
realities
of
that
medium
are
that
it's
limited.
what
is
happening
today
is
that
broadcasters
are
simply
saying
if
you
--
if
you're
peddling
commercial
items,
you
have
a
right
to
buy
time.
if
you
want
to
peddle
political
ideas
or
political
parties,
you
have
no
right
to
buy
time.
and
we
say
that
there
is
something
less
than
that
kind
of
outrageous
discrimination
and
less
than
an
absolute
ban
that
the
broadcasters
can
operate
under.
i
think
that
it
--
you
know,
to
--
to
say
that
the
whole
broadcasting
system
will
collapse
if
this
court
or
anyone
opens
up
the
airwaves
to
people
or
political
parties
to
discuss
controversial
issues
is
contrary
to
all
the
experience
that
--
that
we
have.
the
--
the
newspapers
and
the
magazines
of
this
country
are
not
filled
with
political
advertisements.
the
corporations
that
advertise
their
television
sets,
and
their
automobiles,
and
their
department
stores,
and
their
grocery
items,
in
the
newspapers
of
this
country
have
not
taken
the
billions
and
billions
of
dollars
they
spent
in
newspapers
and
--
and
simply
turned
it
over
to
the
discussion
of
--
of
public
issues.
i
don't
think
there's
--
i
think
the
wealthy
man
is
--
is
a
straw
man
of
a
--
of
a
very
thin
proportions
and
i
think
that
anyone
that
has
attempted
to
--
to
find
this
wealthy
man
to
--
to
buy
television
time
for
the
discussion
of
controversial
issues
by
the
major
political
parties,
at
least,
and
i
would
dare
say
would
be
difficult
--
more
difficult
for
others
who
just
found
out
that
there's
not
a
barrel
of
money
out
there
waiting
to
be
spent.
we're
not
going
to
face
this
problem.we
do
have
to
recognize,
however,
the
broadcast
medium
is
a
limited
medium.
as
far
as
we
--
we
believe
that
the
red
lion
in
its
language,
we
believe
our
first
amendment
right
for
direct
communication
is
strong
and
involves
a
right
of
direct
communication.
we
think
there
is
no
substitute
for
that.
i
--
i
don't
think
anyone
in
this
chamber
could
believe
that
--
that
it
is
the
same
thing
to
have
walter
cronkite
or
john
chancellor
or
roger
mudd
explain
what
president
nixon
said
as
it
is
to
have
president
nixon
make
his
direct
appeal.
would
anyone
assert
that
if
--
if
walter
cronkite
had
laid
out
the
reasons
why
president
nixon
invaded
cambodia,
the
american
support
for
that
would
have
gone
from
five
percent
to
70%?
would
anyone
assert
that
there
is
some
journalistic
intervention
that
could
have
made
the
case
for
the
gulf
of
tonkin
resolution
of
president
johnson
more
effectively
that
he
could
have
made
it?should
the
broadcasters
or
mr.
wollenberg
or
mr.
jennes,
would
they
like
to
have
frank
reynolds
or
walter
cronkite
come
up
here
and
explain
what
they're
trying
to
tell
the
court?
the
point
is
that
this
is
the
medium
of
communication
in
this
country.
it
has
a
greater
impact
on
our
political
dialogue
and
our
electoral
system
than
any
other
form
available
to
any
person
or
party
in
this
country
and
we
simply
want
a
right
to
--
we
want
to
rule
that
simply
says
to
the
broadcasters,
“you
cannot
say
that
no
political
party
can
purchase
time
on
television
for
the
discussion
of
controversial
issues.”
mr.
joseph
a.
califano,
jr.
no.
your
honor,
we've
been
through
a
whole
series
of
--
of
rules
on
that.
there
are
a
variety
of
rules
in
that
area
right
now.
some
--
some
networks
and
stations
have
a
policy
which
says
that
during
election
periods
a
--
time
can
be
purchased
by
candidates
or
people
on
behalf
of
candidates.
mr.
joseph
a.
califano,
jr.
and
spot
announcements
may
be
purchase
during
those
periods.
but
outside
of
those
periods,
you
may
not
do
that.
mr.
joseph
a.
califano,
jr.
that's
correct.
the
rules
indeed
of
the
networks
in
this
case
changed
the
--
at
various
points
of
this
proceeding.
cbs
initially
took
the
position,
for
example,
that
they
would
not
sell
time
except
during
election
periods
and
then
only
to
candidates,
either
spot
time
or
--
or
programing
time
and
they
denied
us
programming
time.
three
months
later
when
the
fcc
after
we
filed
our
case,
cbs
said
they
would
change
the
rule
and
they
would
permit
spot
announcements
simply
to
raise
funds
but
not
to
discuss
controversial
issues.
eight
months
later
when
we
were
in
the
court
of
appeals,
cbs
said
that
it
would
now
permit
spot
announcements
for
us
to
discuss
controversial
issues,
announcements
of
60
seconds
or
less
and
to
raise
funds
but
no
more.
and
in
part,
i
might
say,
it
seems
to
us
that
it
is
not
--
you
know,
we
should
not
have
to
depend
on
how
cbs
executives
feel
on
any
given
morning
or
at
any
given
stage
of
a
legal
proceeding
as
to
what
our
rights
are
to
--
to
express
our
views
to
the
american
people
over
the
medium
that
95%
of
the
american
homes
find
as
their
greatest
source
of
information
and
news
in
this
country.
i
have
made
the
discrimination
point
in
terms
of
spot
announcements.
i
believe
the
same
kind
of
discrimination
exists
in
the
programming
area
as
we've
laid
out
below
and
here.
there
--
it
seems
to
me
that
--
that
all
--
all
programming,
people
can
buy
programming,
religious
organizations
can
buy
programming
but
the
--
the
two
major
political
parties
cannot
buy
programming.
mr.
joseph
a.
califano,
jr.
if
the
networks
sell
it.
mr.
joseph
a.
califano,
jr.
not
to
my
knowledge.
mr.
joseph
a.
califano,
jr.
well,
no.
and
mr.
justice
stewart,
their
right
to
absolutely
prohibit
this
kind
of
discussion.
mr.
joseph
a.
califano,
jr.
that's
--
that's
correct.
mr.
joseph
a.
califano,
jr.
that's
correct,
mr.
justice.
mr.
joseph
a.
califano,
jr.
oh,
you'd
have
a
much,
much
more
greater
situation.
mr.
joseph
a.
califano,
jr.
no.
that
is
not
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
joseph
a.
califano,
jr.
that
is
correct,
mr.
chief
justice.
there
are,
i
might
note,
according
to
the
census
bureau,
about
a
hundred
religions
in
this
country.
two
or
three
of
them
have
--
have
purchased
time
on
sunday
mornings
for
religious
shows
and
it
hasn't
destroyed
television
on
sunday.
the
other
95
haven't
come
bouncing
in
to
acquire
that
time.
some
corporations
are
--
are
affectively
granted
the
right
to
purchase
entire
amounts
of
time,
witness,
as
we
say
in
our
brief,
some
of
the
national
geographic
and
the
--
and
xerox
shows
that
have
appeared
on
the
air.
the
broadcasters
set
up
in
their
briefs
a
whole
chamber
of
horrors.
the
only
one
of
which
was
discussed
here
this
morning
was
the
wealthy
man,
a
straw
man,
which
--
with
which
i
have
dealt
briefly.
as
far
as
the
remaining
points
that
they
raised
about
administrative
difficulties,
i
would
urge
the
justices
of
this
court
or
their
clerks
to
review
the
briefs
in
the
red
lion
case
and
the
arguments
of
the
broadcasters
in
the
red
lion
case,
and
they
will
find
a
neat
and
remarkable
similarity
between
the
arguments
they
made
there
and
the
arguments
they
make
here
today
about
administrative
horror.
but
today,
cbs
in
its
brief
before
this
court
and
before
the
commission
and
the
court
of
appeal
says,
“their
public
issue
of
broadcasting
has
never
been
better.
it
improves
every
year
since
red
lion.”
so,
i
cannot,
with
all
due
respect,
give
and
i
do
not
think
this
court
should
give
just
as
the
court
of
appeals
do
not
give,
much
credence
to
this
administrative
horrors.
and
the
bottom-line
on
that
point,
i
submit,
mr.
justices
is
this,
in
red
lion,
in
the
unanimous
decision,
the
court
of
appeals
of
the
--
this
court
noted
that
it
would
not
decide
the
case
on
the
basis
of
extreme
possibilities
or
extreme
examples.
the
solicitor
general
indeed,
in
his
argument
in
red
lion
urged
that
particular
point
upon
this
court.
in
case
of
doubt,
this
court
opted
to
go
with
the
first
amendment
values
and
the
rights
of
free
speech,
noting
and
inviting
the
broadcasters
to
go
back
to
the
federal
communications
commission
and
ultimately
come
back
here
if
any
of
the
horrors
that
they
envision
--
envisioned
any
of
their
nightmares
ever
came
to
pass.
none
of
them
ever
did
come
to
pass
and
the
same
kind
of
doubt,
if
any
one
has
it,
in
this
room
besides
the
broadcasters
of
dangers
should
be
treated
in
the
same
kind
of
way
in
this
case.
we
believe
that
that
opting
for
free
speech
is
consistent
with
everything,
with
a
whole
host
of
decisions
of
this
court.
we
believe
that
this
court
and
in
effect,
opted
for
free
speech
and
the
(inaudible)
case
in
a
situation
of
dangerous,
explosive,
dirty,
and
outrageous
fighting
between
truckers
and
railroads.
in
times
v
sullivan,
this
court
opted
for
free
speech
in
a
situation
where
a
newspaper
lied.
in
the
pentagon
papers
this
court
opted
for
free
speech
even
though
the
national
security
of
this
country
might
have
been
involved.
in
this
case,
the
only
inhibition
on
opting
for
free
speech
or
a
host
of
possibles
that
the
network's
claim
may
come
to
pass
and
that
they
may
hurt
the
system
of
broadcasting.
i
think
that
in
this
--
mr.
joseph
a.
califano,
jr.
no,
but
in
their
--
in
their
opinion
they
--
they
expressed
explicit
agreement
with
the
--
with
the
several
of
the
problems.
mr.
joseph
a.
califano,
jr.
we
do
have
a
judgment
--
mr.
joseph
a.
califano,
jr.
yes,
we
do,
mr.
justice
white.
we
have
a
judgment
of
the
administrative
agency,
with
which
a
--
obviously,
we
disagree.
we
--
we
do
not
think
that
the
fcc
--
well,
we
have
two
judgments.
we
have
a
judgment
of
an
administrative
agency
which
says
“yes.
sell
them
spot
announcement
time.
that's
no
problem
--
mr.
joseph
a.
califano,
jr.
--
to
raise
funds.”
but
you
don't
have
to
sell
them
time
to
discuss
controversial
issues.
that
part
of
the
judgment
does
not
make
sense
to
us
in
the
sense
that,
i
do
not
think
it's
possible
for
a
major
political
party
to
advertise,
to
raise
funds
without
saying
something
about
some
issue
or
about
not
--
or
about

well,
i
was
--
i
think
that
the
--
the
provisions
of
the
communications
act
that
we
would
say
the
fcc
is
not
dealing
within
its
present
ruling
or
one,
the
fact
that
these
are
publicly
own
airwaves,
section
301.
number
two,
that
they
have
not
adequately
applied
the
public
interest
standard
that
in
connection
with
the
communications
area,
the
public
interest
standard
is
just
imbedding
in
first
amendment
considerations.
and
to
the
extent
that
first
amendment
considerations
are
imbedded
in
that
standard,
i
might
say
that
the
--
it
is
this
court
that
--
that
really
is
the
expert
in
the
first
amendment
and
not
the

on

brief,

a

of
determinations

the
fact
that
in

in

the

necessarily
does
involves
some

considerations

some
of

does

some
the

that

thank
you.
