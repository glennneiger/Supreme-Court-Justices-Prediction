justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
layne,
let
me
oversimplify
it
and
i
think
i’m
asking
the
same
question
justice
rehnquist
did.
if
we
agree
with
the
solicitor
general
that
556
and
557
do
not
apply,
then
it
does
not
follow,
in
your
view,
that
you
necessarily
loose
the
case?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
let
me,
while
i
have
you
interrupted,
let
me
ask
you
the
same
questioned
i
asked
mr.
huntington.
if
we
go
along
with
your
position
here,
what
is
the
practical
effect,
in
your
view,
of
prolonged
hearings,
delays,
and
the
like?
after
all,
this
problem
has
been
with
us
a
long
time.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
i
take
it,
implicit
in
your
position
that
you
just
taken
as
to
absent
to
shortage,
surely
these
rules
are
involved.
