justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
your
opponents
come
back
there
and
argue
that
because
of
the
1966
amendment,
in
its
language,
saying
that
the
additional
determination
should
be
made
whether
upon
these
considerations,
that
that
is
an
implied
requirement.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
if
they
challenged--
they
wanted
to
challenge
the
underlying
data
itself?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
because
of
its
rule
making,
they
wouldn’t
be
bound
by
their
failure

themselves?
justice

rehnquist
mr.
layne,
is
your
claim
based
on
something
outside
the
administrative
procedure
act
or
is
it
based
on
the
administrative
procedure
act
alone?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
other--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
are
you
saying
that
you
have
a
constitutional--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but,
of
course
if
florida
east
coast
can
request
oral
argument,
presumably
200
other
railroads
can
too
and,
by
then,
you
are
talking
about
a
rather
significant
delay
factor.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
say
that
the
delay
factor
there
ought
not
to
prevail
over
their
claims
to
that--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
did
you
want
to
find
out
from
him
what
his
interpretation
of
the
word
“adequate”
was?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
you
had
90
days,
didn’t
you,
after
receiving
the
interim
report
in
which
to
make
objection
on
the
grounds
of
the
inadequacy
of
the
originating
notice
if
you
wanted
to?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
mr.
hollander,
as
a
matter
at
least
of
theoretical
operation,
you’re
not
required
to
use
other
freight
carriers
and
you’re
not
required,
are
you,
to
lend
you
freight
cars
to
anyone
else?
