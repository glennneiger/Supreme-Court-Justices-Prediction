mr.
a.
alvis
layne
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
represent
the
florida
east
coast
railway
co.
with
the
consent
of
the
court,
mr.
hollander,
the
seaboard
coast
line
railroad,
will
divide--
and
i
will
divide
the
time
available
to
the
appellees,
and
we
hope
to
avoid
repetition
in
our
arguments.
i
shall
undertake
to
discuss
whether
the
commission
order
is
required
to
be
made
on
the
record
of
a
hearing,
that
is
whether
the
parties
were
entitled
to
an
oral
hearing
under
sections
556
and
557
of
the
administrative
procedure
act.
i
will
also
discuss
whether
the
florida
east
coast
was
prejudiced
by
the
denial
of
this
request
for
a
hearing
and
oral
argument,
a
request
to
cross-examine
commission
agents
on
their
audits
and
studies,
and
the
request
to
subpoena
commission
experts
to
present
testimony
to
contradict
the
basic
facts
assumed
and
asserted
in
the
commission’s
report
imposing
incentive
per
diem
charges
on
the
railroad
industry
and
on
the
florida
east
coast.
now,
sections
556
and
557
of
the
administrative
procedure
act
are
applicable,
we
think,
because
the
commission
action,
in
fixing
compensation
to
be
paid
for
the
use
of
freight
cars,
is
quasi-judicial
action.
like
agency
actions
considered
in
morgan,
a
rate
case,
the
ohio
bell
telephone
case,
and
the
division
cases
which
this
court
has
recently
decided
in
north-south
divisions.
the
commission
order
must
be
based
on
the
record
of
a
hearing.
the
nature
of
the
commission’s
action
in
this
case,
that
is
to
say
you
must
pay
another
railroad
so
much
for
the
use
of
its
equipment,
in
freight
car
compensation
proceedings,
distinguish
this
proceeding
from
the
commission’s
order
to
prescribing
operative
rules,
and
that’s
the
rule
that
was
involved
in
allegheny-ludlum.
mr.
a.
alvis
layne
it--
on
two,
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
mr.
a.
alvis
layne
i
would
say
that
the
administrative
procedure
act
itself,
as
this
court
noted
in
allegheny-ludlum,
would
say
that
the
scope
and
nature
of
the
hearing
required
to
discharge
the
duty
in
this
case,
in
this
kind
of
instance,
fixing
compensation,
is
within
556
and
557
and
the
hearing
to
which
section
114
(a)
refers
must
be
a
hearing
on
the
record.
i
would
go
further,
however,
and
say,
as
the
courts
have
said
in,
for
example,
palmer
v.
united
states,
dealing
with
compensation
for
freight
car,
that
the
fixing
of
compensation
that
one
railroad
must
pay
to
another
railroad
for
the
use
of
a
car
which
it
must
accept
to
further
the
through
movement
of
freight
is
a
judicial
action,
and
that
you
are
entitled
to
due
process
in
the
fixing
of
that.
and,
like
the
commission’s
and--
like
this
court’s
decision,
for
example,
in
the
londoner
v.
denver,
210
us,
concerned
with
a
taxation
problem,
we--
if
that
tax,
if
that
compensation
is
to
be
imposed,
we
are
entitled
to
due
process,
so
i
would
say
that
beyond
the
question
simply
of
the
administrative
procedure
act,
yes,
we
are--
mr.
a.
alvis
layne
yes,
i
say
that
there
is
also
beyond
the
administrative
procedure
act,
there’s
a
due
process
issue.
mr.
a.
alvis
layne
certainly,
sir.
i
mean,
it
must
be.
mr.
a.
alvis
layne
that’s
right
but,
of
course,
in
londoner
v.
denver,
210
us,
the
supreme
court--
this
court
said
no
matter
how
brief,
no
matter
how
informal,
you
cannot
delegate
someone
simply
to
filing
papers.
they
must
have
an
opportunity
for
an
oral
argument
and
they
must
have
an
opportunity
for
an
oral
hearing
only
to
present
their
material.
mr.
a.
alvis
layne
no,
because
i
think
the
next
question
arises
as
to
whether
you
can--
the
commission
can
be
invested
with
the
kind
of
power
that
it
exercised
in
this
case
to
take
the
money
or,
as
it
has
been
somewhat
popularly
said
in
the
railroad
industry,
a
kind
of
reverse
robin
hood
effect.
you
rob
from
the
poor
and
give
to
the
rich
railroads
so
that
the
rich
railroads
can
buy
more
cars
that
they
can
have
the
poor
railroads
pay
for.
mr.
a.
alvis
layne
certainly,
and
i
think
that
the
question
of
delay
is
minimum.
i
think
that
the
interstate
commerce
commission
is
empowered
and
has
full
authority,
both
under
the
administrative
procedure
act,
its
own
rules
of
practice,
and
its
statute
to
regulate
the
content
and
control
the
time
of
and
extent
of
hearings.
i
do
not
think
that
what
i
requested
would
have
delayed
the
interstate
commerce
commission
in
its
disposition
of
this
case.
mr.
a.
alvis
layne
if
those
railroads
could
show
that
the
failure
to
grant
them
a
hearing
prejudiced
them
as
so
far
as
the
florida
east
coast
railway
showed
to
the
court
below
and
as
i
hope
to
show
to
this
court,
and
i
think
they
would
be
entitled
to
that
hearing.
mr.
a.
alvis
layne
certainly
not,
and
this
court’s
repeatedly
said
it
shouldn’t.
mr.
a.
alvis
layne
well,
i
should
think,
when
we
started
out
with
this
case,
it
would’ve
been
limited
to
people
in
this
case
but,
to
be
frank
with
you
mr.
chief
justice,
the
interstate
commerce
commission
has
had
a
petition
pending
forth
since--
before,
since
july
17,
1972
by
a
number
of
railroad,
including
among
them,
the
largest
creditor
railroad,
the
largest
one
to
receive
incentive
per
diem,
asking
the
commission
to
reopen
this
because
of
the
failure
of
incentive
per
diem.
now,
i
don’t
know
what
they’ll
do
with
that.
mr.
a.
alvis
layne
but
so
far--
mr.
a.
alvis
layne
there
is
no
shortage,
sir.
the
problem,
the
inters--
the--
a
committee
of
congress,
in
september
6,
1972,
reported
that
there
was
no
such
thing
as
a
shortage.
now,
there
is
a
great
deal
of
mythology
as
well
as
methodology
about
this.
i
think
that--
i
think,
and
a
number
of
railroads
have
testified
since
that
time
that
there
is
now
a
no
shorting
of
boxcars.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
there’s
a
surplus
of
boxcar,
not
because
they
were
purchased.
boxcars
have
continued
to
decline.
mr.
a.
alvis
layne
i
don’t
know
whether
they
do
or
not.
they
haven’t
taken
any
action
on
the
materials
that
have
been
filed
with
them,
and
i
said
they
were
filed
in
july
1972
asking
them,
because
there
was
no
shorting,
to
reopen
the
proceeding,
to
change
the
incentive
per
diem,
to
eliminate
it
or
at
least
modify
it,
and
no
action
has
been
taken.
i
can’t
tell
whether
they
agree
or
disagree.
mr.
a.
alvis
layne
certainly,
but
i
thought
that
i
could--
i
thought
that
i
would
be
able
to
prove
before
the
commission
some
of
the
things
that
i
held
were
essential
to
their
taking
action
in
the
first
place,
if
they
had
given
me
an
opportunity
to
do
so.
let
me
talk
for
a
moment.
we
are--
let
me
just
conclude
our
argument
on
this
question
of
what
we’re
entitled
to
as
to
why
a
way
of
a
hearing,
and
say
that
we
think
the
statute
itself
sets
up
standards
and
requires
findings,
and
that
statute
prohibits,
for
example,
the
interstate
commerce
commission
for
making
an
incentive
per
diem
applicable
to
any
type
of
car,
the
supply
of
which
is
adequate.
now,
surely,
it
was
open
to
me
to
demonstrate
that
under
any
measure
of
act
of
adequacy
that
they
would--
that
there
was
an
adequate
supply
of
the
plain
boxcars
to
which
the
commission
referred
and
to
which
it
made
incentive
per
diem
applicable,
and
that’s
what
i
attempted
to
do.
now,
we
say
that
the
statute
requiring
these
considerations
clearly
indicates
that
the
commission
must
take--
must
make
findings,
and
that
those
findings
are
quasi-judicial
in
their
scope
and
character.
we
also
say
that
this
is
supported
not
only
by
the
statute,
but
by
the
legislative
history
of
that--
of
this
section
of
the
statute.
it
is
supported
by
the
commission’s
own
determinations.
this
proceeding
was
not
started
without
reference
to
556
and
557.
the
commission
said
that
it
was
complying
with
sections
556
and
557
when
it
initiated
the
proceeding.
it
initiated
them
under
those
sections
and
it
purported
to
decide
them
in
compliance
with
those
sections
of
the
administrative
procedure
act.
it
is
only
for
the
first
time
in
this
court
that
it
is
claimed
that
556
and
557
and
the
hearing
requirements
of
those
sections
do
not
apply
to
this
proceeding.
now,
let
me
turn
for
just
a
second
to
this
question
of
what
i
attempted
to
do
by
way
of
evidence.
i
attempted
to
subpoena
commission
personnel
familiar
with
and
expert
in
freight
car
supply,
allocation,
and
movement.
people
whom
the
commission
had
themselves
testified
in
prior
proceedings
that
testimony
of
persons
that
had
them--
had
been
offered
as
witnesses
in
prior
proceedings
on
these
very
points.
and,
i
offered--
and
i
wanted
to
prove
with
that
testimony
that
the
standard
of
adequacy
that
was
applied
by
the
commission
in
this
case
was
improper,
was
not
right,
that
it
was
an
unreasonable
one,
and
i
wanted
to
do
it
with
expert
testimony
and
i
couldn’t
do
that
with
my
own
experts
because
every
expert
that
testified
that
it
was
a
railroad
was
referred
to
by
the
commission
as
“that
is
an
opinion
of
a
railroad
official.”
you’ll
see
it
in
their
report.
i
wanted
to
present
another
testimony
of
a
non-railroad
official
with
nationwide
experience
with
respect
to
this
matter,
not
florida
east
coast.
mr.
a.
alvis
layne
no,
i
wanted
to
ask
him
what
an
adequate
supply
would
be
and
whether
a
railroad
could
respond
to
a
request
for
a--
whether,
in
his
expert
judgment,
a
supply
could
be
termed
adequate,
whether
you
could
measure
the
adequacy
of
a
supply
by
saying
you
must
report
that
car--
you
must
place
that
car
on
the
day
it’s
ordered,
which
is
the
standard
that
the
commission
applied
in
this
case.
i
also
wanted
to
have
that
person
testify,
those
people
testify
that
if
you
applied
a
standard
that
you
should
furnish
the
car
on
demand
on
the
day
it
was
requested,
that
such
a
supply
of
plain
boxcars
would
be
so
great,
now
mind
you
this
is
at
all
stations,
at
all
locations
throughout
the
united
states
that
this
kind
of
a
standard
would
apply,
the
supply
would
be
so
great,
they
would
have
so
many
boxcars,
you’d
have
so
many
car
that
the
traffic
wouldn’t
move
on
the
railroad.
you
couldn’t
get
an
engine
on
the
railroads.
mr.
a.
alvis
layne
well
of
course,
obviously,
and
this
is
what
i
was
trying
to
prove
and
what
i
was
trying
to
reach
and
get
at
in
proving.
now,
the
next
thing
i
expected,
therefore,
to
present
expert
testimony
that
was
not
available
to
me.
mr.
a.
alvis
layne
because
i
had
no
such
expert
with
nationwide
experience,
and
the
best
and
on--
the
expert
outside
the
railroad
business
that
would
know
about
this
was
precisely
the
same
people
that
the
commission
had
had
testify
on
the
same
points
in
prior
proceeding,
and
i
had
every
reason
to
know
how
they
would
testify
because
i
had
copies
of
their
testimony
or
at
least
i
had
indications
of
their
testimony.
now,
they
had
presented
their
oral
experts
on
this
same
point.
as
long
ago
as
1947,
they
give
these
very
self
same
kinds
of
opinion
evidence
to
support
their
action.
now,
i
didn’t
have
any
wide
term
of
that.
my
15
minutes
has
expired.
thank
you.
mr.
a.
alvis
layne
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
represent
the
florida
east
coast
railway
co.
with
the
consent
of
the
court,
mr.
hollander,
the
seaboard
coast
line
railroad,
will
divide--
and
i
will
divide
the
time
available
to
the
appellees,
and
we
hope
to
avoid
repetition
in
our
arguments.
i
shall
undertake
to
discuss
whether
the
commission
order
is
required
to
be
made
on
the
record
of
a
hearing,
that
is
whether
the
parties
were
entitled
to
an
oral
hearing
under
sections
556
and
557
of
the
administrative
procedure
act.
i
will
also
discuss
whether
the
florida
east
coast
was
prejudiced
by
the
denial
of
this
request
for
a
hearing
and
oral

a
request
to

now,
sections
556

we
think,
because
the
commission

in

the

the

the
kind
of
power
that
it
exercised
in
this
case
to
take
the
money
or,
as
it
has
been
somewhat
popularly
said
in
the
railroad
industry,
a
kind
of
reverse
robin
hood
effect.
you
rob
from
the
poor
and
give
to
the
rich
railroads
so
that
the
rich
railroads
can
buy
more
cars
that
they
can
have
the
poor
railroads
pay
for.
mr.
a.
alvis
layne
certainly,
and
i
think
that
the
question
of
delay
is
minimum.
i
think
that
the
interstate
commerce
commission
is
empowered
and
has
full
authority,
both
under
the
administrative
procedure
act,
its
own
rules
of
practice,
and
its
statute
to
regulate
the
content
and
control
the
time
of
and
extent
of
hearings.
i
do
not
think
that
what
i
requested
would
have
delayed
the
interstate
commerce
commission
in
its
disposition
of
this
case.
mr.
a.
alvis
layne
if
those
railroads
could
show
that
the
failure
to
grant
them
a
hearing
prejudiced
them
as
so
far
as
the
florida
east
coast
railway
showed
to
the
court
below
and
as
i
hope
to
show
to
this
court,
and
i
think
they
would
be
entitled
to
that
hearing.
mr.
a.
alvis
layne
certainly
not,
and
this
court’s
repeatedly
said
it
shouldn’t.
mr.
a.
alvis
layne
well,
i
should
think,
when
we
started
out
with
this
case,
it
would’ve
been
limited
to
people
in
this
case
but,
to
be
frank
with
you
mr.
chief
justice,
the
interstate
commerce
commission
has
had
a
petition
pending
forth
since--
before,
since
july
17,
1972
by
a
number
of
railroad,
including
among
them,
the
largest
creditor
railroad,
the
largest
one
to
receive
incentive
per
diem,
asking
the
commission
to
reopen
this
because
of
the
failure
of
incentive
per
diem.
now,
i
don’t
know
what
they’ll
do
with
that.
mr.
a.
alvis
layne
but
so
far--
mr.
a.
alvis
layne
there
is
no
shortage,
sir.
the
problem,
the
inters--
the--
a
committee
of
congress,
in
september
6,
1972,
reported
that
there
was
no
such
thing
as
a
shortage.
now,
there
is
a
great
deal
of
mythology
as
well
as
methodology
about
this.
i
think
that--
i
think,
and
a
number
of
railroads
have
testified
since
that
time
that
there
is
now
a
no
shorting
of
boxcars.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
there’s
a
surplus
of
boxcar,
not
because
they
were
purchased.
boxcars
have
continued
to
decline.
mr.
a.
alvis
layne
i
don’t
know
whether
they
do
or
not.
they
haven’t
taken
any
action
on
the
materials
that
have
been
filed
with
them,
and
i
said
they
were
filed
in
july
1972
asking
them,
because
there
was
no
shorting,
to
reopen
the
proceeding,
to
change
the
incentive
per
diem,
to
eliminate
it
or
at
least
modify
it,
and
no
action
has
been
taken.
i
can’t
tell
whether
they
agree
or
disagree.
mr.
a.
alvis
layne
certainly,
but
i
thought
that
i
could--
i
thought
that
i
would
be
able
to
prove
before
the
commission
some
of
the
things
that
i
held
were
essential
to
their
taking
action
in
the
first
place,
if
they
had
given
me
an
opportunity
to
do
so.
let
me
talk
for
a
moment.
we
are--
let
me
just
conclude
our
argument
on
this
question
of
what
we’re
entitled
to
as
to
why
a
way
of
a
hearing,
and
say
that
we
think
the
statute
itself
sets
up
standards
and
requires
findings,
and
that
statute
prohibits,
for
example,
the
interstate
commerce
commission
for
making
an
incentive
per
diem
applicable
to
any
type
of
car,
the
supply
of
which
is
adequate.
now,
surely,
it
was
open
to
me
to
demonstrate
that
under
any
measure
of
act
of
adequacy
that
they
would--
that
there
was
an
adequate
supply
of
the
plain
boxcars
to
which
the
commission
referred
and
to
which
it
made
incentive
per
diem
applicable,
and
that’s
what
i
attempted
to
do.
now,
we
say
that
the
statute
requiring
these
considerations
clearly
indicates
that
the
commission
must
take--
must
make
findings,
and
that
those
findings
are
quasi-judicial
in
their
scope
and
character.
we
also
say
that
this
is
supported
not
only
by
the
statute,
but
by
the
legislative
history
of
that--
of
this
section
of
the
statute.
it
is
supported
by
the
commission’s
own
determinations.
this
proceeding
was
not
started
without
reference
to
556
and
557.
the
commission
said
that
it
was
complying
with
sections
556
and
557
when
it
initiated
the
proceeding.
it
initiated
them
under
those
sections
and
it
purported
to
decide
them
in
compliance
with
those
sections
of
the
administrative
procedure
act.
it
is
only
for
the
first
time
in
this
court
that
it
is
claimed
that
556
and
557
and
the
hearing
requirements
of
those
sections
do
not
apply
to
this
proceeding.
now,
let
me
turn
for
just
a
second
to
this
question
of
what
i
attempted
to
do
by
way
of
evidence.
i
attempted
to
subpoena
commission
personnel
familiar
with
and
expert
in
freight
car
supply,
allocation,
and
movement.
people
whom
the
commission
had
themselves
testified
in
prior
proceedings
that
testimony
of
persons
that
had
them--
had
been
offered
as
witnesses
in
prior
proceedings
on
these
very
points.
and,
i
offered--
and
i
wanted
to
prove
with
that
testimony
that
the
standard
of
adequacy
that
was
applied
by
the
commission
in
this
case
was
improper,
was
not
right,
that
it
was
an
unreasonable
one,
and
i
wanted
to
do
it
with
expert
testimony
and
i
couldn’t
do
that
with
my
own
experts
because
every
expert
that
testified
that
it
was
a
railroad
was
referred
to
by
the
commission
as
“that
is
an
opinion
of
a
railroad
official.”
you’ll
see
it
in
their
report.
i
wanted
to
present
another
testimony
of
a
non-railroad
official
with
nationwide
experience
with
respect
to
this
matter,
not
florida
east
coast.
mr.
a.
alvis
layne
no,
i
wanted
to
ask
him
what
an
adequate
supply
would
be
and
whether
a
railroad
could
respond
to
a
request
for
a--
whether,
in
his
expert
judgment,
a
supply
could
be
termed
adequate,
whether
you
could
measure
the
adequacy
of
a
supply
by
saying
you
must
report
that
car--
you
must
place
that
car
on
the
day
it’s
ordered,
which
is
the
standard
that
the
commission
applied
in
this
case.
i
also
wanted
to
have
that
person
testify,
those
people
testify
that
if
you
applied
a
standard
that
you
should
furnish
the
car
on
demand
on
the
day
it
was
requested,
that
such
a
supply
of
plain
boxcars
would
be
so
great,
now
mind
you
this
is
at
all
stations,
at
all
locations
throughout
the
united
states
that
this
kind
of
a
standard
would
apply,
the
supply
would
be
so
great,
they
would
have
so
many
boxcars,
you’d
have
so
many
car
that
the
traffic
wouldn’t
move
on
the
railroad.
you
couldn’t
get
an
engine
on
the
railroads.
mr.
a.
alvis
layne
well
of
course,
obviously,
and
this
is
what
i
was
trying
to
prove
and
what
i
was
trying
to
reach
and
get
at
in
proving.
now,
the
next
thing
i
expected,
therefore,
to
present
expert
testimony
that
was
not
available
to
me.
mr.
a.
alvis
layne
because
i
had
no
such
expert
with
nationwide
experience,
and
the
best
and
on--
the
expert
outside
the
railroad
business
that
would
know
about
this
was
precisely
the
same
people
that
the
commission
had
had
testify
on
the
same
points
in
prior
proceeding,
and
i
had
every
reason
to
know
how
they
would
testify
because
i
had
copies
of
their
testimony
or
at
least
i
had
indications
of
their
testimony.
now,
they
had
presented
their
oral
experts
on
this
same
point.
as
long
ago
as
1947,
they
give
these
very
self
same
kinds
of
opinion
evidence
to
support
their
action.
now,
i
didn’t
have
any
wide
term
of
that.
my
15
minutes
has
expired.
thank
you.
