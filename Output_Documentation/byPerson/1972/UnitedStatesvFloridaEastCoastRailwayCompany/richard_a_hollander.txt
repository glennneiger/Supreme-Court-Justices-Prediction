mr.
richard
a.
hollander
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
seaboard
coastline
raised
three
questions
before
the
jacksonville
court.
we
said,
first,
that
there
was
a
lack
of
a
proper
hearing
and
mr.
layne
has
covered
that
subject,
and
i
simply
want
to
say
that
i
agree
with
points
which
he
raised.
we
also
charged
in
the
court
below
that
icc
had
failed
to
comply
with
the
requirements
of
114
(a)
and
then
we
said
that
the
commission’s
conclusions
lack
sufficient
evidentiary
support.
the
court
below
found
for
us,
as
you
know,
on
the
hearing
issue
and,
for
that
reason,
said
that
it
would
not
and
in
fact
it
did
not
discuss
the
other
contentions.
in
its
reply
brief,
the
government
has
said
that
these
other
issues
are
not
substantial
and,
of
course,
we
disagree
with
that.
mr.
huntington,
in
his
argument
today,
treated
lightly,
if
at
all,
with
the
other
issues.
he
should
not,
i
submit,
because
he
is
asking
you
to
overturn
the
lower
court’s
decision
and
to
reinstate
the
decision
of
the
icc.
now,
section
114
(a),
as
certainly
you
know
by
now,
is
three
sentences
in
length.
the
first
one,
the
one
you
treated
with
in
allegheny-ludlum
is
from
the
1917-ish
car
service
act.
we’re
talking
about
the
other
two
sentences
that
were
the
result
of
public
law
89430,
and
those
sentences
tell
the
commission
what
factors
they
must
c
consider
in
determining
the
payment
of
compensation.
mr.
richard
a.
hollander
yes,
it
was,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
a.
hollander
it
was
not,
your
honor.
the
only--
mr.
richard
a.
hollander
it
was
not,
your
honor,
because
of
this
reason.
i
was
going
to
join
the
long
island
in
that
proceeding.
i
had
my
papers
all
ready
when
the
attorney
for
the
long
island
called
me
and
told
me
that
he
had
stipulated
with
the
government
to
a
single
very
limited
issue,
that
is
whether,
in
the
long
island
circumstances,
they
were
entitled
to
a
hearing.
and,
i
was
not
willing
to
go
to
the
district
court
before
judge
friendly.
mr.
richard
a.
hollander
he
decided
very
definitely
that
556
and
557
governed.
mr.
richard
a.
hollander
for
the
reasons
stated
by
mr.
layne,
and
that’s
correct,
yes.
i’m
of
course,
now,
talking
about
these
other
points
and
i
say
that
the
court
below,
had
it
reach
those
points
which
it
did
not,
would’ve
found
in
our
favor.
i’m
pretty
confident
about
that
because
i
use
as
a
starting
point
the
commission’s
own
1967
incentive
per
diem
decision,
the
one
that
mr.
huntington
mentioned
to
you
a
few
moments
ago,
the
decision
which
led
up
to
the
one
which
is
involved
here.
that
1967
decision
itself
demonstrates,
in
the
commission’s
own
words,
that
what
it
did
here
was
arbitrary
and
was
not
rationally
supported
and,
of
course,
section
706
of
the
administrative
procedure
act
says
that
a
review
in
court
ought
to
hold
such
a
decision
unlawful.
the
1967
decision
which
is
in
332
icc
listed
a
number
of
specific
factors
which
the
commission
felt
it
had
to
consider
in
deciding
upon
incentive
per
diem
compensation,
and
which
weren’t
considered
here.
and,
it
concluded
in
that
proceeding,
after
extensive
hearings
and
incidentally
including
all
hearings
in
which
icc
personnel
were
examined,
that
incentive
per
diem
would
not
improve
operating
practices
nor
would
it
lead
to
more
efficient
use
of
cars
nor
would
the
building
of
more
cars
be
generated.
that’s
what
the
commission
said.
without
considering
those
factors
which
it
said
in
1967
it
had
to
look
into
and
which
i
submit
114
(a)
says
it
must
look
into,
it
decided
here
in
the
case
before
your
honors
that
it
wouldn’t
examine
into
those
factors
and
it
did
a
complete
about-face
and
prescribed
an
incentive
per
diem.
now,
insofar
as
car
ownership
is
concerned,
my
railroad,
my
company
is
a
creditor
road.
it
bought
and
built
boxcars
as
the
icc
directed
to
meet
the
needs
of
shippers
on
its
lines.
particularly
prejudicial
to
us
then,
was
the
decision
of
the
commission
that
some
time
in
its
internal
consideration
of
the
proceeding
and
without,
in
any
way,
warning
us
in
the
convening
notices
that
it
would
confine
incentive
per
diem
to
plain
boxcars,
to
standard
boxcars.
this
was
done
after
concluding
in
the
1967
decision
that
for
most--
for
much
transportation
the
standard
boxcar
has
been
replaced,
that
equipped
boxcars
frequently
are
used
for
the
same
purpose
as
standard
boxcars.
and,
after
telling
us
in
such
decisions
as
the
one
you
reviewed
in
allegheny-ludlum
that
any
failure
on
our
part
to
acquire
cars
to
meet
the
needs
of
shippers
on
our
lines
would
be
unconscionable,
to
use
their
word.
again,
we
did
tailor
our
car
fleet,
but
in
equipping
boxcars
they
no
longer
could
be
designated
plain
boxcars
and
they
don’t,
therefore,
qualify
for
incentive.
so,
in
the
netting
out
of
incentive
per
diem,
we’ll
be
called
upon
to
pay
over
to
other
railroads,
one
of
them
our
major
competitor,
wild
amounts
of
money
and,
of
course,
our
overall
freight
car
program,
which
we
think
had
been
pretty
good,
is
going
to
suffer.
mr.
richard
a.
hollander
let
me
say
several
things.
first
of
all,
it
was
60
days.
we
did
respond.
we
did
object
on
grounds
which
i
had
just
been
stating
and,
furthermore,
i
would
like
to
submit
the
proposition
to
this
court
that
what
i
received
in
the
interim
decision
was
a
fixed
anticipatory
judgment
and
i
don’t
think
it
was
ever
meant
to
yield
to
any
facts
that
we
might
submit
later
on.
we
tried--
we
started
studies
in
order
to
try
to
dispute
some
of
the
things
that
the
commission
had
raised
and
we
asked
for
more
time
to
do
it
and
the
commission
wouldn’t
give
it
to
us.
within
two-month’s
time,
it
had
come
out
with
its
final
report
which
was
the
same
with
all
practical
respects
as
its
interim
report.
now,
section
114
(a)
tells
the
commission
again
that
it
must
consider
all
factors
affecting
the
national
freight
car
supply.
it
didn’t
do
that.
as
again
i
said,
in
its
1967
decision
it
told
us
it
had
to,
and
if
the
court
below
had
gotten
to
that
question,
which
it
did
not,
i’m
confident
that
it
would
have
sustained
our
position.
now,
you
heard
mr.
huntington
a
few
moments
back
to
say
that
what
the
commission
did
was
an
experiment.
those--
that’s
not
his
word.
that’s
the
commission’s
word.
they
said
what
it
was
doing
here
was
an
experiment.
in
experimenting,
it’s
going
to
take
millions
of
our
dollars
not
as
a
penalty
for
doing
something
wrong,
but
simply
to
give
to
other
carriers
for
reasons
over
which
we
have
no
control,
and
i
submit
to
your
honors
that
there’s
no
law
that
permits
the
icc
to
do
that
particularly
in
the
absence
of
due
process.
mr.
richard
a.
hollander
let
me
say,
your
honor,
that
we
are
required
to
use
other
railroad’s
boxcars.
you
see,
we
originate
cars--
freight
on
our
line.
we
use
the
cars
which
we
have
bought
to
meet
the
needs
of
our
shippers,
and
they
go
out
and
they
head
west.
for
example,
when
we
turn
them
over--
when
we
turn
those
cars
over
to
our
connecting
lines
going
west,
they
must
take
those
cars.
similarly,
on
cars
coming
east-south
onto
our
line,
we
must
take
them.
we
may
not
have
any
need
for
them
but
we
must
take
them
with
the
load.
we
must
deliver
the
load,
but
immediately
upon
the
taking
of
those
cars
at
our
junction,
we
are
at
once
charged
with
incentive
per
diem
which,
as
you
know,
is
something
over
and
above
the
regular
per
diem.
this
is
a
penalty
against
us
for
no
wrong
for
which
we
have
done,
except
to
follow
the
interstate
commerce
commission
directive
to
acquire
cars
to
meet
the
needs
of
the
shippers
on
our
line.
now,
of
course,
what
the
commission
is
asking
us
to
do
now
is
don’t
do
that.
forget
the
idea
of
buying
equipped
boxcars.
apply
your
money,
your
revenues
to
the
purchase
of
plain
boxcars
which
somebody
else
needs.
let
me
take
a
moment
to
say
too,
in
arguing
that
there’s
no
support
for
the
commission’s
conclusion,
that--
or
little
support,
there’s
no
support
at
all,
not
one
bit
in
the
record
that
the
use
and
movement
of
cars
would
improve
as
a
result
of
incentive
per
diem,
and
the
commission
never
even
bothered
to
look
into
the
question
of
how
the
weak
debtor
railroads
were
going
to
be
able
to
afford
the
additional
investment
for
cars,
which
the
icc
concluded
in
this
decision,
would
be
acquired
by
them
because
of
this
incentive
per
diem
rule.
now,
mr.
huntington,
in
answering
your
question,
mr.
justice
blackmun,
spoke
of
two-and-a
half
years
of
experience
now
before
the
commission
in
this
incentive
per
diem
experiment
and
he
mentioned,
and
so
did
mr.
layne,
that
there
are
pending
petitions
before
the
commission.
the
first
one
was
filed
in
july.
not
a
word
has
been
heard
from
the
icc.
there
had
been
a
great
many
file
since
then.
over
20
railroads,
including
the
penn
central
in
fact,
have
asked
the
icc
to
abandon
this
incentive
per
diem
concept
because
of
the
fact
that
it
simply
isn’t
working.
in
fact,
the
government
itself--
i
have
in
front
of
me
the
government’s
petition,
the
petition
of
the
department
of
agriculture,
which
says
that
the
national
fleet
of
boxcar
is
still
shrinking
and
its
says
that
the
commission
ought
to
reopen
this
proceeding
to
see
if,
in
fact,
there
is
a
plain
boxcar
shortage.
mr.
richard
a.
hollander
yes,
sir.
mr.
richard
a.
hollander
there
had
been
a
serious--
may
i
stop
and
say
that
there
had
been
a
serious,
since
july
up
until
september.
mr.
richard
a.
hollander
if--
mr.
richard
a.
hollander
if
there
is
a
critical
shortage
of
boxcars,
i
would
say
they
should’ve
acted
immediately
upon
some
suspicion
that
this
experiment
is
not
working.
it’s
more
than
two
or
three
months,
your
honor.
it’s
two
or
three
years
now.
they
have
the
same
figures
that
we
have
that
show
that
there
has
been
a
constant
decrease
in
the
number
of
plain
boxcars
in
the
railroad’s
fleet,
a
constant
decrease
after
the
incentive
per
diem
went
into
effect.
there
are
45,000
less
plain
boxcars
in
the
fleet
today
than
there
were
when
incentive
per
diem
went
into
effect,
and
this
has
been
a
study
decline.
this
was
known
to
the
commission
in
the
first
year
after
it
put
this
experiment
into
order,
into
work,
and
the
commission
itself
in
its
order
said
that
it
was
going
to
take
a
look
and
if
this
didn’t
work
then
it
would
reopen
and
take
another
look
at
it.
and,
it’s
been
two-and-a
half
years
and
the
commission
simply
has
not
done
that.
my
time
is
almost
up,
and
i
want
to
point
out
to
this
court
what
it
has
said
in
a
number
of
cases.
most
recently,
to
my
knowledge,
in
the
bee
and
oak
case
in
393
us
which
involved
the
division
of
revenues
that
it’s
not
going
to
be
led
off
by
a
haze
of
certain
expertise,
to
use
your
words,
and
you
are
not,
you
said,
going
to
bridge
the
gap
by
blind
reliance
on
expertise.
and,
that’s
precisely
what
you’re
being
asked
to
do
here
and
it
will
not
do
for
the
commission
to
come
to
you,
as
it’s
done
in
its
jurisdictional
statement,
and
tell
you
that
it
was
moved
to
a
decision
by
an
impatient
congress,
a
congress
which
told
the
commission
that
it
had
had
enough
facts
in
its
record
to
go
ahead
and
make
a
decision.
i
submit
that
the
commission
must,
in
fact,
have
that
necessary
information,
and
it
did
not
here.
thank
you
very
much
for
your
attention.
mr.
richard
a.
hollander
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
seaboard
coastline
raised
three
questions
before
the
jacksonville
court.
we
said,
first,
that
there
was
a
lack
of
a
proper

and
mr.
layne
has
covered
that
subject,
and
i
simply
want
to
say
that
i
agree

points
which
he
raised.
we
also
charged
in
the
court
below
that
icc
had
failed
to
comply
with
the
requirements
of
114
(a)
and
then
we
said
that
the
commission’s
conclusions
lack
sufficient
evidentiary
support.
the
court
below
found
for
us,
as
you
know,
on
the
hearing
issue
and,
for
that
reason,
said
that
it
would
not
and
in
fact
it
did
not
discuss
the
other
contentions.
in
its
reply
brief,
the
government
has
said
that
these
other
issues
are
not
substantial
and,
of

we
disagree

mr.
huntington,
in
his
argument
today,
treated
lightly,
if
at

with

he
should
not,
i
submit,
because
he
is
asking

not,
your

the
only--
mr.
richard

it

because
of
this

and
which
weren’t
considered
here.
and,
it
concluded
in
that
proceeding,
after
extensive
hearings
and
incidentally
including
all
hearings
in
which
icc
personnel
were
examined,
that
incentive
per
diem
would
not
improve
operating
practices
nor
would
it
lead
to
more
efficient
use
of
cars
nor
would
the
building
of
more
cars
be
generated.
that’s
what
the
commission
said.
without
considering
those
factors
which
it
said
in
1967
it
had
to
look
into
and
which
i
submit
114
(a)
says
it
must
look
into,
it
decided
here
in
the
case
before
your
honors
that
it
wouldn’t
examine
into
those
factors
and
it
did
a
complete
about-face
and
prescribed
an
incentive
per
diem.
now,
insofar
as
car
ownership
is
concerned,
my
railroad,
my
company
is
a
creditor
road.
it
bought
and
built
boxcars
as
the
icc
directed
to
meet
the
needs
of
shippers
on
its
lines.
particularly
prejudicial
to
us
then,
was
the
decision
of
the
commission
that
some
time
in
its
internal
consideration
of
the
proceeding
and
without,
in
any
way,
warning
us
in
the
convening
notices
that
it
would
confine
incentive
per
diem
to
plain
boxcars,
to
standard
boxcars.
this
was
done
after
concluding
in
the
1967
decision
that
for
most--
for
much
transportation
the
standard
boxcar
has
been
replaced,
that
equipped
boxcars
frequently
are
used
for
the
same
purpose
as
standard
boxcars.
and,
after
telling
us
in
such
decisions
as
the
one
you
reviewed
in
allegheny-ludlum
that
any
failure
on
our
part
to
acquire
cars
to
meet
the
needs
of
shippers
on
our
lines
would
be
unconscionable,
to
use
their
word.
again,
we
did
tailor
our
car
fleet,
but
in
equipping
boxcars
they
no
longer
could
be
designated
plain
boxcars
and
they
don’t,
therefore,
qualify
for
incentive.
so,
in
the
netting
out
of
incentive
per
diem,
we’ll
be
called
upon
to
pay
over
to
other
railroads,
one
of
them
our
major
competitor,
wild
amounts
of
money
and,
of
course,
our
overall
freight
car
program,
which
we
think
had
been
pretty
good,
is
going
to
suffer.
mr.
richard
a.
hollander
let
me
say
several
things.
first
of
all,
it
was
60
days.
we
did
respond.
we
did
object
on
grounds
which
i
had
just
been
stating
and,
furthermore,
i
would
like
to
submit
the
proposition
to
this
court
that
what
i
received
in
the
interim
decision
was
a
fixed
anticipatory
judgment
and
i
don’t
think
it
was
ever
meant
to
yield
to
any
facts
that
we
might
submit
later
on.
we
tried--
we
started
studies
in
order
to
try
to
dispute
some
of
the
things
that
the
commission
had
raised
and
we
asked
for
more
time
to
do
it
and
the
commission
wouldn’t
give
it
to
us.
within
two-month’s
time,
it
had
come
out
with
its
final
report
which
was
the
same
with
all
practical
respects
as
its
interim
report.
now,
section
114
(a)
tells
the
commission
again
that
it
must
consider
all
factors
affecting
the
national
freight
car
supply.
it
didn’t
do
that.
as
again
i
said,
in
its
1967
decision
it
told
us
it
had
to,
and
if
the
court
below
had
gotten
to
that
question,
which
it
did
not,
i’m
confident
that
it
would
have
sustained
our
position.
now,
you
heard
mr.
huntington
a
few
moments
back
to
say
that
what
the
commission
did
was
an
experiment.
those--
that’s
not
his
word.
that’s
the
commission’s
word.
they
said
what
it
was
doing
here
was
an
experiment.
in
experimenting,
it’s
going
to
take
millions
of
our
dollars
not
as
a
penalty
for
doing
something
wrong,
but
simply
to
give
to
other
carriers
for
reasons
over
which
we
have
no
control,
and
i
submit
to
your
honors
that
there’s
no
law
that
permits
the
icc
to
do
that
particularly
in
the
absence
of
due
process.
mr.
richard
a.
hollander
let
me
say,
your
honor,
that
we
are
required
to
use
other
railroad’s
boxcars.
you
see,
we
originate
cars--
freight
on
our
line.
we
use
the
cars
which
we
have
bought
to
meet
the
needs
of
our
shippers,
and
they
go
out
and
they
head
west.
for
example,
when
we
turn
them
over--
when
we
turn
those
cars
over
to
our
connecting
lines
going
west,
they
must
take
those
cars.
similarly,
on
cars
coming
east-south
onto
our
line,
we
must
take
them.
we
may
not
have
any
need
for
them
but
we
must
take
them
with
the
load.
we
must
deliver
the
load,
but
immediately
upon
the
taking
of
those
cars
at
our
junction,
we
are
at
once
charged
with
incentive
per
diem
which,
as
you
know,
is
something
over
and
above
the
regular
per
diem.
this
is
a
penalty
against
us
for
no
wrong
for
which
we
have
done,
except
to
follow
the
interstate
commerce
commission
directive
to
acquire
cars
to
meet
the
needs
of
the
shippers
on
our
line.
now,
of
course,
what
the
commission
is
asking
us
to
do
now
is
don’t
do
that.
forget
the
idea
of
buying
equipped
boxcars.
apply
your
money,
your
revenues
to
the
purchase
of
plain
boxcars
which
somebody
else
needs.
let
me
take
a
moment
to
say
too,
in
arguing
that
there’s
no
support
for
the
commission’s
conclusion,
that--
or
little
support,
there’s
no
support
at
all,
not
one
bit
in
the
record
that
the
use
and
movement
of
cars
would
improve
as
a
result
of
incentive
per
diem,
and
the
commission
never
even
bothered
to
look
into
the
question
of
how
the
weak
debtor
railroads
were
going
to
be
able
to
afford
the
additional
investment
for
cars,
which
the
icc
concluded
in
this
decision,
would
be
acquired
by
them
because
of
this
incentive
per
diem
rule.
now,
mr.
huntington,
in
answering
your
question,
mr.
justice
blackmun,
spoke
of
two-and-a
half
years
of
experience
now
before
the
commission
in
this
incentive
per
diem
experiment
and
he
mentioned,
and
so
did
mr.
layne,
that
there
are
pending
petitions
before
the
commission.
the
first
one
was
filed
in
july.
not
a
word
has
been
heard
from
the
icc.
there
had
been
a
great
many
file
since
then.
over
20
railroads,
including
the
penn
central
in
fact,
have
asked
the
icc
to
abandon
this
incentive
per
diem
concept
because
of
the
fact
that
it
simply
isn’t
working.
in
fact,
the
government
itself--
i
have
in
front
of
me
the
government’s
petition,
the
petition
of
the
department
of
agriculture,
which
says
that
the
national
fleet
of
boxcar
is
still
shrinking
and
its
says
that
the
commission
ought
to
reopen
this
proceeding
to
see
if,
in
fact,
there
is
a
plain
boxcar
shortage.
mr.
richard
a.
hollander
yes,
sir.
mr.
richard
a.
hollander
there
had
been
a
serious--
may
i
stop
and
say
that
there
had
been
a
serious,
since
july
up
until
september.
mr.
richard
a.
hollander
if--
mr.
richard
a.
hollander
if
there
is
a
critical
shortage
of
boxcars,
i
would
say
they
should’ve
acted
immediately
upon
some
suspicion
that
this
experiment
is
not
working.
it’s
more
than
two
or
three
months,
your
honor.
it’s
two
or
three
years
now.
they
have
the
same
figures
that
we
have
that
show
that
there
has
been
a
constant
decrease
in
the
number
of
plain
boxcars
in
the
railroad’s
fleet,
a
constant
decrease
after
the
incentive
per
diem
went
into
effect.
there
are
45,000
less
plain
boxcars
in
the
fleet
today
than
there
were
when
incentive
per
diem
went
into
effect,
and
this
has
been
a
study
decline.
this
was
known
to
the
commission
in
the
first
year
after
it
put
this
experiment
into
order,
into
work,
and
the
commission
itself
in
its
order
said
that
it
was
going
to
take
a
look
and
if
this
didn’t
work
then
it
would
reopen
and
take
another
look
at
it.
and,
it’s
been
two-and-a
half
years
and
the
commission
simply
has
not
done
that.
my
time
is
almost
up,
and
i
want
to
point
out
to
this
court
what
it
has
said
in
a
number
of
cases.
most
recently,
to
my
knowledge,
in
the
bee
and
oak
case
in
393
us
which
involved
the
division
of
revenues
that
it’s
not
going
to
be
led
off
by
a
haze
of
certain
expertise,
to
use
your
words,
and
you
are
not,
you
said,
going
to
bridge
the
gap
by
blind
reliance
on
expertise.
and,
that’s
precisely
what
you’re
being
asked
to
do
here
and
it
will
not
do
for
the
commission
to
come
to
you,
as
it’s
done
in
its
jurisdictional
statement,
and
tell
you
that
it
was
moved
to
a
decision
by
an
impatient
congress,
a
congress
which
told
the
commission
that
it
had
had
enough
facts
in
its
record
to
go
ahead
and
make
a
decision.
i
submit
that
the
commission
must,
in
fact,
have
that
necessary
information,
and
it
did
not
here.
thank
you
very
much
for
your
attention.
