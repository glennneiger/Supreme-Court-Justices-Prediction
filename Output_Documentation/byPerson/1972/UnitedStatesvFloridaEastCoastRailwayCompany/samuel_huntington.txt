mr.
samuel
huntington
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
direct
appeal
from
a
three-judge
district
court
sitting
in
the
middle
district
of
florida.
the
district
court
enjoined
the
enforcement
of
interstate
commerce
commission
rules
prescribing
an
incentive
element
to
be
added
to
the
daily
rentals
that
one
railroad
pays
to
another
for
the
use
of
its
boxcars.
the
basic
question
presented
is
whether
the
commission
should
have
afforded
the
appellee,
railroads,
in
oral
hearing
prior
to
promulgating
the
rules.
the
incentive
per
diem
rules
here
in
issue
were
promulgated
under
section
114
(a)
of
the
interstate
commerce
act.
that
section
authorizes
the
commission,
after
hearing,
to
establish
reasonable
rules
with
respect
to
car
service
including
the
compensation
to
be
paid
for
the
use
of
freight
cars.
under
a
1966
amendment
to
that
section,
the
commission
may,
in
fixing
that
compensation,
prescribe
an
incentive
element
to
improve
the
use
of
existing
cars
and
to
encourage
the
acquisition
of
new
cars.
freight
car
shortages
have
been
a
serious
and
recurring
problem
throughout
most
of
this
century.
in
recent
years,
the
commission,
with
the
strong
encouragement
and
support
of
congress,
has
been
moving
on
a
number
of
fronts
to
combat
this
problem.
just
last
term
in
the
allegheny-ludlum
case,
this
court
upheld
two
car
service
rules
promulgated
by
the
commission
under
section
114
(a).
those
rules
governed
the
return
of
unloaded
freight
cars
to
their
owners.
the
instant
rule
making
proceeding
was
initiated
by
the
commission
in
1967
after
an
earlier
proceeding
had
been
dismissed
for
warrant
of
sufficient
evidence.
in
initiating
this
proceeding,
the
commission
ordered
the
railroads
to
participate
in
a
nationwide
study
of
freight
car
shortages.
during
an
11-month
period
in
1968,
over
32,000
reports
were
filed
from
state
stations
throughout
the
country--
no,
it
were
filed
from
about
2,600
freight
stations
throughout
the
country.
each
report
listed
for
a
given
day
at
a
given
station:
(1)
the
freight
cars
ordered
by
shippers
for
delivery
on
or
before
that
day,
(2)
the
number
of
cars
available
at
that
station
for
placement
to
shippers,
and
(3)
the
number
of
cars
actually
delivered
to
shippers
during
that
day.
extensive
field
audits
were
conducted
by
commission
personnel
to
assure
that
the
reports
were
filed
and
filled
out
directly
and,
also,
to
assure
that
they
did
not
reflect
over-auditing
of
cars
by
shippers.
the
collective
data
were
put
on
magnetic
tapes
and
were
available
to
the
railroads.
in
december
1969,
the
commission
issued
an
interim
report
containing
an
analysis
of
the
data
collected
from
the
study
and
proposing
a
rule
establishing
a
scale
of
incentive
per
diem
charges
for
plain
boxcars.
in
appendices
to
the
report,
the
commission
described
in
detail
the
methodology
employed
by
the
study
and
set
forth
a
series
of
tables
and
graphs
showing
the
results
of
the
studies--
the
study
for
plain
boxcars.
the
study
showed
that
there
were
deficiencies
in
placements
of
freight
cars
with
shippers
throughout
the
year,
but
that
the
deficiencies
were
most
severe
during
the
heavy
traffic
months
from
september
through
february
each
year.
the
study
also
revealed
that,
at
the
same
time
the
deficiencies
were
reported
by
some
freight
stations,
surpluses
of
cars
would
be
reported
by
other
stations
frequently
on
the
same
railroad.
analyzing
these
data,
the
commission
included
that,
at
least
during
the
peak
period
from
september
through
february
each
year,
the
surpluses
were
not
sufficient
so
that
the
railroads
could
be
expected
to
eliminate
the
deficiencies
simply
by
using
their
boxcars
more
efficiently.
the
commission,
thus,
concluded
that
the
existing
supply
of
plain
boxcars
was
inadequate.
it
does
propose
the
incentive
per
diem
rules
to
be
applicable
during
the
six-month
heavy
loaded--
heavy
traffic
period
of
each
year.
now,
the
proposed
incentive
rules
were
designed
by
the
commission
to
do
two
things.
first,
they
were
designed
to
improve
the
utilization
of
existing
cars
and,
second,
they
were
designed
to
provide
funds
to
those
railroads
who
earned
per
diem
income
than
they
paid
out
with
which
to
purchase
new
freight
cars
to
augment
the
national
supply.
mr.
samuel
huntington
yes,
they
would.
the
interim
report
noted
that
the
proposals
were
tentative
and
invited
the
railroads
to
submit
verified
statements
of
fact
and
briefs
with
respect
to
their
proposals.
the
commission
ordered
that
any
party
requesting
an
oral
hearing
should
set
forth
in
detail
its
need
for
an
oral
hearing
in
the
evidence
it
intended
to
reduce.
in
response
to
the
interim
report,
numerous
railroads
filed
verified
statements
and
briefs,
some
supporting
the
proposed
rules
and
others
opposing
them.
several
railroads
requested
oral
hearings,
including
both
appellees
here.
seaboard,
in
its
statement
to
the
commission,
primarily
argued
that
the
commission
should
not
impose
incentive
charges
on
plain
boxcars
without
also
imposing
them
on
specially
equipped
cars.
mr.
samuel
huntington
well,
in
our
view,
it’s
not
so
much
a
question
of
fact
as
it
is
a
question
of
the
proper
standard
to
be
applied
in
determining
prejudice.
our
primary
argument
on
that
point,
which
i
will
come
to
in
due
course,
is
that
the
district
court
simply
applied
the
wrong
standard.
well,
florida
east
coast
did
file
two
verified
statements
setting
forth
its
position
on
the
rules
in
some
detail,
and
it
also
requested
an
oral
hearing
and
it
specified
four
factors
which
it
would--
intended
to
show
at
the
oral
hearing,
and
i
will
also
discuss
those.
while
in
april
1970,
the
commission
entered
its
final
report
and
adopted
the
rules
virtually
in
the
same
form
as
had
been
proposed
in
the
interim
report.
the
commission
specifically
answered
and
rejected
the
policy
arguments
advanced
by
seaboard
and
florida
east
coast
for
not
applying
the
rules
to
them.
it
had
also
rejected
all
the
requests
for
oral
hearing
on
the
grounds
that
no
party
showed
prejudice.
both
seaboard
and
florida
east
coast
then
brought
actions
in
the
florida
district
court
and
the
district
court
set
aside
the
commission’s
order
for
failure
to
hold
oral
hearings.
the
appellees
based
their
claim
to
an
oral
hearing
in
addition
to
one
of
the
provision
of
section
114
(a).
they
place
their
claim
on
section
556
(d)
of
the
administrative
procedure
act.
that
section
provides
that,
in
rule
making,
“an
agency
may,
when
a
party
will
not
be
prejudice
thereby,
adopt
procedures
for
the
submission
of
oral
or
part
of
the
evidence
in
written
form.”
the
appellees
claim
that
they
showed
prejudice
in
their
submissions
to
the
commission.
before
reaching
this
issue
though,
there
is
a
threshold
issue
of
whether
section
556
(d)
applies
at
all
to
this
rule
making
proceeding.
now,
section
553
of
the
administrative
procedure
act
sets
forth
the
basic
procedural
requirements
for
rule
making,
and
section
553
(c)
requires
agencies
to
give
interested
parties
“an
opportunity
to
submit
written
data,
views,
or
arguments
with
or
without
opportunity
for
oral
presentation.”
clearly,
this
was
done
in
this
case
by
the
commission.
section
553
(c),
however,
goes
on
to
state
that
“when
rules
are
required
by
statute
to
be
made
on
the
record
after
an
opportunity
for
agency
hearing,
sections
556
and
557
apply
instead
of
this
subsection.”
now,
section
114
(a)
of
the
interstate
commerce
act,
under
which
the
rules
here
were
promulgated,
requires
a
hearing
but
it
no
where
states
that
the
commission’s
decision
must
be
on
the
record
of
that
hearing.
now,
unless
the
“on
the
record”
requirement
can
be
inferred
from
the
context
of
the
statute,
sections
556
and
557
of
the
administrative
procedure
would
not
apply
to
this
case.
now,
this
precise
issue
was
decided
by
this
court
in
the
allegheny-ludlum
case
last
year.
in
the
applicable
passage
this
court
stated,
we
do
not
suggest
that
only
the
precise
words
on
the
record
in
the
applicable
statute
will
suffice
to
make
sections
556
and
557
applicable
to
rule
making
proceedings,
but
we
do
hold
that
the
language
of
the
esch
car
service
act,
which
is
section
114
(a),
is
insufficient
to
invoke
these
sections.
mr.
samuel
huntington
well,
they
do
and
our
response
to
that
is
that
the
1966
amendment
simply
builds
on
what
was
there
before
and
it
does
require
the
commission
to
take
into
account
certain
factors
before
imposing
an
incentive
element
but,
in
no
way,
suggested
that,
in
considering
those
factors,
the
commission
must
do
so
only
on
the
basis
of
the
record.
the
hearing
requirement
whether
you’re
considering
a
proceeding
as
in
allegheny
under
the
first--
in
allegheny-ludlum
under
the
first
part
of
the
statute
or
whether
you’re
considering
incentive
per
diem
proceedings.
under
the
second
part,
the
hearing
requirement
is
the
same,
and
that
requirement
is
imposed
in
the
very
beginning
of
the
statute.
in
short,
we
believe
that
the
allegheny-ludlum
holding
is
controlling
here,
but
i’d
like
to
turn
now
to
the
second
part
of
our
argument
which
assumes
that
section
556
does
apply
to
this
proceeding.
in
that
event,
the
commission
was
justified
in
doing
away
and
not
having--
not
holding
oral
hearings
unless
appellees
have
established
before
the
commission
that
they
would
be
prejudiced
by
the
absence
of
an
oral
hearing.
the
critical
question
here
then
is
what
showing
is
necessary
to
establish
prejudice
and
did
appellees
make
that
showing.
in
our
view,
there
are
two
basic
tests
that
a
request
for
oral
hearing
must
meet
to
establish
prejudice.
and
getting
back
to
your
question,
mr.
chief
justice,
we
would
maintain
that
the
district
court
did
not
apply
these
tests.
therefore,
its
finding
of
prejudice
was
based
on
an
erroneous
standard
and
is
not
a
finding
of
fact
which
this
court
should
defer
to.
the
first
and
most
obvious
test
is
that
the
request
must
show
a
need
to
establish
facts
in
an
oral
hearing
that
could
not
be
adequately
established
through
written
submissions.
both
appellees
have
failed
to
meet
this
initial
test.
florida
east
coast’s
basic
opposition
to
the
rules
stems
from
the
fact
that
it
is
located
on
a
peninsula
and
terminates
far
more
plain
boxcar
traffic
than
it
originates,
and
because
a
lot
of
the
traffic
terminates
in
the
southern
part
of
florida
as
the
verified
statements
submitted
shows,
the
railroad
must
continue
to
pay
per
diem
charges
until
it
can
get
the
unloaded
boxcars
back
to
the
northern
part
of
its
line
and
on
to
a
connecting
railroad.
florida
east
coast
argues
that
because
it
owns
sufficient
plain
boxcars
to
satisfy
the
limited
needs
of
its
shippers
for
plain
boxcars
and
because
it
operates
an
efficient
operation
and
generally
returns
empty
cars
as
fast
as
it
can,
the
incentive
per
diem
rules
would
neither
prompt
it
to
purchase
new
cars
nor
result
in
the
faster
return
of
freight
cars
and,
therefore,
the
rule
shouldn’t
be
applied
to
them.
while
this
argument
shows
that
the
application
of
the
rules
may
not
be
in
florida
east
coast’s
best
interest,
they
do
not
show
that
an
oral
hearing
was
necessary
to
establish
these
facts.
in
fact,
these
facts
i’ve
just
outlined
were
set
forth
in
verified
statements
in
some
detail
submitted
by
florida
east
coast,
and
the
commission’s
final
report
shows
that
it
considered
the
arguments
advanced
by
florida
east
coast,
these
policy
arguments,
and
it
considered
the
verified
statements
but
concluded
that
an
exemption
from
the
incentive
rules
for
all
terminating
roads
would
not
be
in
the
public
interest.
now,
seaboard’s
basic
opposition
to
the
rules
is
based
on
its
ownership
of
a
large
number
of
specially
equipped
boxcars
to
which
the
rules
do
not
apply.
although
seaboard
did
not
submit
any
verified
statements,
it
has
made
no
showing
that
it
could
not
have
established
this
fact
by
written
submissions
and
that
it
has
made
no
showing
that
an
oral
hearing
was
necessary
here.
now,
perhaps
recognizing
that
an
oral
hearing
was
not
necessary
to
establish
the
adverse
effect
of
the
rules
on
them,
both
railroads
argue
that
an
oral
hearing
was
necessary
to
cross-examine
commission
personnel
on
the
preparation
an
analysis
of
the
freight
car
study.
here
too,
however,
appellees
could
have
challenged
the
commission’s
conclusion
from
the
study
by
written
submission
and
arguments.
the
appendices
to
the
commission’s
interim
report
set
forth
in
plain
terms
the
methodology
of
the
study.
no
one
has
suggested
that
this
methodology
was
unsound.
i’d
like
to
quote
from
the--
a
verified
statement
submitted
by
the
penn
central,
this
is
on
page
151
of
the
appendix,
where
the
penn
central
concedes
the
study
data
appears
to
have
been
gathered
by
recognized
methods
of
sampling
and
statistical
techniques.
penn
central
then
goes
on
to
quibble
with
the
conclusions
reached
by
the
commission.
i
don’t
understand
appellees
to
suggest
that
the
statistical
method
used
here
were
inappropriate.
with
this
challenge,
the
commission’s
conclusions
from
the
tables
and
graphs
that
the
incentive
per
diem
rule
should
be
adopted
to
improve
the
utilization
and
supply
of
freight
cars.
they
challenge
the
analysis
that
the
commission
made
from
the
data
and
the
commission’s
conclusion
that
there
was
indeed
a
national
shortage
of
freight
cars
and
that
the
rules
reasonably
adopted
to
combat
that
shortage.
well,
if
appellees
believe
that
the
conclusions
are
unsound,
their
remedy
is
not
to
cross-examine
commission
personnel
who
assisted
the
commission
in
analyzing
these
data
as
part
of
the
decision
making
process.
their
remedy
is
to
analyze
the
data
on
their
own,
as
i
stated
before,
the
data
were
available
to
them,
and
on
the
basis
of
their
own
analysis
to
argue
against
the
commission’s
conclusions
or,
for
that
matter,
they
could
start
with
the
commission
tables
and
graphs
in
the
interim
report
and
argue
that
the
commission’s
conclusions
based
on
that
data
were
inappropriate.
mr.
samuel
huntington
well,
they
have
not
chosen
to
do
that,
other
than
to--
well,
i’ll
backtrack
a
little
bit.
florida
east
coast
does
challenge
the
way
in
which
part
of
the
data
was
obtained
and
that
is
when
i
said
that
the
reports
submitted
to
the
railroads
required
each
freight
station
to
list
the
number
of
cars
ordered
by
shippers
for
placement
on
or
before
the
study
date.
florida
east
coast
maintains
that
it’s
unreasonable
to
include
in
the
orders,
orders
which
were
received
on
the
study
day
for
placement
that
day
and
this,
i
think
you
probably--
can
properly
be
construed
as
an
attack
on
the
method
of
the
study.
i
think
the
commission
recognized
that
this
perhaps
was
a
deficiency
in
the
study.
in
fact,
they
proposed
a
further
study
in
1969,
which
was
opposed
by
both
railroads,
in
which
they
would
have
remedied
that
particular
point
and
they
would’ve
only
listed
as
orders,
orders
received
by
the
beginning
of
the
study
day
for
placement
on
or
before
the
study
day
and
would
not
have
included
orders
received
on
the
study
day
for
placement
that
day.
but,
to
the
extent
that
florida
east
coast
wants
to
establish
that,
that’s
conceded
that
there
is
a
deficiency
there.
well,
the
second
basic
test
that
a
party
must
show,
as
you
remember,
i
said
there
were
two
tests.
the
second
basic
test
they
must
show
to
show
prejudice
from
the
absence
of
an
oral
hearing
is
to
show
that
the
facts
it
desires
to
establish
at
an
oral
hearing
are
material
and
have
a
reasonable
chance
of
influencing
the
commission
in
reaching
its
decision.
with
respect
to
their
asserted
need
to
cross-examine
commission
personnel,
both
appellees
have
completely
failed
this
test.
seaboard
has
failed
to
indicate
in
any
way
what
facts
it
would
wish
to
establish.
florida
east
coast,
on
its
part,
did
list
what
it
hoped
to
establish.
one
thing
it
did
hope
to
establish
was
this
24-hour
business
about
freight
cars
ordered
for
placement
on
the
study
day.
the
other
“facts”
that
it
wished
to
establish
were:
(1)
that
the
deficiencies
reported
in
the
study
“may
not”
be
affected
by
the
supply
of
cars
in
other
regions,
(2)
that
the
addition
of
new
plain
boxcars
“would
necessarily”
reduce
the
number
of
deficiencies,
and
(3)
that
no
one
could
tell
exactly
how
many
boxcars
were
needed.
i
believe
it’s
highly
unlikely
that
the
establishment
of
these
facts
would
have
surprised
or
impressed
the
commission.
the
commission,
throughout
its
report,
does
not
contend
that
they’re
operating
on
a
perfect
set
of
data
here
whether
they
can
guarantee
that
the
rules
they’re
adopting
will
in
fact
work.
what
they
are
saying,
what
the
commission
did
say,
is
that
we
have
this
balanced
statistical
evidence
that,
in
our
best
judgment,
this
evidence
shows
that
there
is
a
shortage
and,
in
our
best
judgment,
the
proper
way
to
go
about
it
is
by
trying
these
incentive
rules.
the
commission
said
that
the
rules
were
designed
“to
test
whether
a
financial
incentive
can
be
employed
to
augment
the
car
fleet.”
this
is
in
the
nature
of
an
experiment.
the
commission,
at
several
points,
said
that
the
proceedings
would
remain
open
and
that
the
rules
could
be
revised
in
view
of
the
experience
of
the
railroads
after
they
had
been
in
effect.
mr.
samuel
huntington
well,
i
think
had
to--
had
it
rule--
at
this
point,
the
rules
are,
in
effect,
against--
apply
to
every
railroad
in
the
country
except
florida
east
coast
and
seaboard.
so,
a
remand
would
just
involve
those
two
railroads
so
i
cannot
say
that
the
delay
would
be
a
matter
of
a
tremendous
significance
to
the
entire
country,
but
they
would--
these
hearings
do
drag
on
and
if
it
gets
into
a
battle
of
expert
witnesses
over
the
proper
interpretation
to
be
given
a
set
of
data,
i
believe,
there
could
be
quite
a
substantial
delay.
mr.
samuel
huntington
i
think,
probably,
years.
mr.
samuel
huntington
well,
i
could
backtrack
on
what
i
said
a
minute
ago.
i
think
we
have
stated
out
in
our--
stated
in
our
jurisdictional
statement
that
if
oral
hearings
are
held,
the
other
railroads
would
be
likely
to
seek
to
intervene
and
that
it
probably
would,
and
the
whole
proceeding
probably
would
be
reopened
and
it
might
be
a
very
protracted
proceeding
indeed.
mr.
samuel
huntington
well,
i
think
that
might
be
one
factor.
another
factor
is
the
commission’s
statement
that
the
proceeding
would
remain
open
and,
in
fact,
i
understand
from
the
commission
that
there
are
petitioners
before
the
commission
right
now
seeking
to
reopen
the
proceeding
and
seeking
to
modify
the
rules.
mr.
samuel
huntington
yes,
the
rest
of
the--
the
rules
have
been
applied
since
september
1,
1970
to
the
rest
of
the
railroads
in
the
country.
mr.
samuel
huntington
how
many
were
appearing?
well,
there
were
a
group
of
railroads.
the
aar,
the
american
association
of
railroads,
there’s
a
shipping
interest
and--
mr.
samuel
huntington
yes,
there
were
multiple
parties
and
numerous
verified
statements,
and
the
proceedings
went
on
for
some
time.
mr.
samuel
huntington
some
of
them
were,
yes.
there,
the
issue
is
not
procedural.
the
issue
there
was
the
underlying
reasonableness
of
the
rules.
well,
finally,
we
suggest
that
if
the
court
agrees
with
us
that
an
oral
hearing
was
not
required
here,
the
court
should
affirm
the
commission’s
order
outright
without
remanding
to
the
district
court
for
consideration
of
other
issues.
now,
the
district
court,
in
deciding
that
an
oral
hearing
was
necessary,
did
not
reach
several
other
issues
raised
by
appellees
and
these
issues,
basically,
are
whether
the
commission
complied
with
all
the
requirements
of
114
(a),
whether
the
rules
are
reasonable,
and
whether
florida
east
coast
should
be
exempted
as
a
terminating
road.
now,
the
reason
we
suggested
that
remand
is
not
necessary
is
we
believe
that
a--
that
these
issues
are
not
substantial.
we
believe
that
the--
a
reading
of
the
allegheny-ludlum
opinion
and
a
reading
of
the
commission
reports
and
keeping
in
mind
the
very
limited
scope
of
review
which
the
allegheny-ludlum
case
underscored,
that
the
rule
should
be
simply
upheld
in
their
entirety
by
this
court.
and
then,
finally,
for
the
reasons
set
forth
at
pages
28-30
of
our
brief,
and
i
won’t
go
into
them
here,
we
urge
that
appellee
should
be
ordered
to
make
restitution
of
the
incentive
charges
that
would’ve
paid
other
railroads
but
for
the
restraining
order
and
injunction
entered
by
the
district
court.
in
conclusion,
we
respectfully
submit
that
the
judgment
below
should
be
reversed.
mr.
samuel
huntington
thank
you.
the--
i’d
first
like
to
correct
one
statement
i
made
in
response
to
a
question
by
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
the
commission
does
not
concede
that
the
method
of
reporting
orders
on
its
study
was
deficient,
and
this
point
is
addressed
in
a
response
to
an
inquiry
by
the
railroads
while
the
freight
car
was--
while
the
study
was
being
done,
and
that
response
is
found
at
pages
189-190
of
the
appendix
and
i’ll
simply
refer
the
court
to
that.
on
the
existence
of
the
shortage
and
on
most
of
mr.
hollander’s
points
about
whether
the
commission
did
in
fact
comply
with
the
standards
of
section
114
(a),
i
refer
the
court
to
the
interim
report
and,
specifically,
to
pages
66
(a)-70
(a)
of
the
jurisdictional
statement
appendix.
there,
the--
that’s
the
critical
part
of
the
interim
report.
it’s
in
appendix
a
and,
there,
the
court
analyzes
in
considerable
detail
and
shows
exactly
the
steps
it
goes
through
in
concluding
that
there
is
a
shortage
and
that
the
percent
of
the
rule
should
be
adopted
to
combat
that
shortage.
to
the
extent,
of
course,
that
there
is
further
evidence
that,
now,
that
maybe
the
shortage
isn’t
as
bad
or
maybe
it’s
worse,
of
course
that
can
be
submitted
to
the
commission
now.
i
just
also
like
to
point
out
that
the--
in
addition
to
these
petitions
which
are
now
pending,
the
american
association
of
railroads
did
petition
for
modification
of
the
rule
some
time
ago
asking
that
the
funds
collected
from
the
incentive
per
diem
charges
be
available
for
leasing
cars
in
addition
to
purchasing
new
cars,
and
the
commission
now
has
that
and
will
probably
come
out
with
a
decision
in
the
not
too
distant
future.
finally,
in
response
to
a
point
mr.
justice
white
made,
the
allegheny-ludlum
case,
and
this
case
involved
precisely
the
same
section
of
the
interstate
commerce
act
and
the
same
hearing
requirement,
it’s
that--
it’s
the
third
and
fourth
word
in
the
section
114
(a)
and,
therefore,
we
say
that
the
requirement
should
not
be
different
in
one
proceeding
than
it
is
in
this
proceeding.
mr.
samuel
huntington
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
direct
appeal
from
a
three-judge
district
court
sitting
in
the
middle
district
of
florida.
the
district
court
enjoined
the
enforcement
of
interstate
commerce
commission
rules
prescribing
an
incentive
element
to
be
added
to
the
daily
rentals
that
one
railroad
pays
to
another
for
the
use
of
its
boxcars.
the
basic
question
presented
is
whether
the
commission
should
have
afforded
the
appellee,
railroads,
in
oral
hearing
prior
to
promulgating
the
rules.
the
incentive
per
diem
rules
here
in
issue
were
promulgated
under
section
114
(a)
of
the
interstate
commerce
act.
that
section
authorizes
the
commission,
after
hearing,
to
establish
reasonable
rules
with
respect
to
car
service
including
the
compensation
to
be
paid
for
the
use
of
freight
cars.
under
a
1966
amendment
to
that
section,
the
commission
may,
in
fixing
that
compensation,
prescribe
an
incentive
element
to
improve
the
use
of
existing
cars
and
to
encourage
the
acquisition
of
new
cars.
freight
car
shortages
have
been
a
serious
and
recurring
problem
throughout
most
of
this
century.
in
recent
years,
the
commission,
with
the
strong
encouragement
and
support
of
congress,
has
been
moving
on
a
number
of
fronts
to
combat
this
problem.
just
last
term
in
the
allegheny-ludlum
case,
this
court
upheld
two
car
service
rules
promulgated
by
the
commission
under
section
114
(a).
those
rules
governed
the
return
of
unloaded
freight
cars
to
their
owners.
the
instant
rule
making
proceeding
was
initiated
by
the
commission
in
1967
after
an
earlier
proceeding
had
been
dismissed
for
warrant
of
sufficient
evidence.
in
initiating
this
proceeding,
the
commission
ordered
the
railroads
to
participate
in
a
nationwide
study
of
freight
car
shortages.
during
an
11-month
period
in
1968,
over
32,000
reports
were
filed
from
state
stations
throughout
the
country--
no,
it
were
filed
from
about
2,600
freight
stations
throughout
the
country.
each
report
listed
for
a
given
day
at
a
given
station:
(1)
the
freight
cars
ordered
by
shippers
for
delivery
on
or
before
that
day,
(2)
the
number
of
cars
available
at
that
station
for
placement
to
shippers,
and
(3)
the
number
of
cars
actually
delivered
to
shippers
during
that
day.
extensive
field
audits
were
conducted
by
commission
personnel
to
assure
that
the
reports
were
filed
and
filled
out
directly
and,
also,
to
assure
that
they
did
not
reflect
over-auditing
of
cars
by
shippers.
the
collective
data
were
put
on
magnetic
tapes
and
were
available
to
the
railroads.
in
december
1969,
the
commission
issued
an
interim
report
containing
an
analysis
of
the
data
collected
from
the
study
and
proposing
a
rule
establishing
a
scale
of
incentive
per
diem
charges
for
plain
boxcars.
in
appendices
to
the
report,
the
commission
described
in
detail
the
methodology
employed
by
the
study
and
set
forth
a
series
of
tables
and
graphs
showing
the
results
of
the
studies--
the
study
for
plain
boxcars.
the
study
showed
that
there
were
deficiencies
in
placements
of
freight
cars
with
shippers
throughout
the
year,
but
that
the
deficiencies
were
most
severe
during
the
heavy
traffic
months
from
september
through
february
each
year.
the
study
also
revealed
that,
at
the
same
time
the
deficiencies
were
reported
by
some
freight
stations,
surpluses
of
cars
would
be
reported
by
other
stations
frequently
on
the
same
railroad.
analyzing
these
data,
the
commission
included
that,
at
least
during
the
peak
period
from
september
through
february
each
year,
the
surpluses
were
not
sufficient
so
that
the
railroads
could
be
expected
to
eliminate
the
deficiencies
simply
by
using
their
boxcars
more
efficiently.
the
commission,
thus,
concluded
that
the
existing
supply
of
plain
boxcars
was
inadequate.
it
does
propose
the
incentive
per
diem
rules
to
be
applicable
during
the
six-month
heavy
loaded--
heavy
traffic
period
of
each
year.
now,
the
proposed
incentive
rules
were
designed
by
the
commission
to
do
two
things.
first,
they
were
designed
to
improve
the
utilization
of
existing
cars
and,
second,
they
were
designed
to
provide
funds
to
those
railroads
who
earned
per
diem
income
than
they
paid
out
with
which
to
purchase
new
freight
cars
to
augment
the
national
supply.
mr.
samuel
huntington
yes,
they
would.
the
interim
report
noted
that
the
proposals
were
tentative
and
invited
the
railroads
to
submit
verified
statements
of
fact
and
briefs
with
respect
to
their
proposals.
the
commission
ordered
that
any
party
requesting
an
oral
hearing
should
set
forth
in
detail
its
need
for
an
oral
hearing
in
the
evidence
it
intended
to
reduce.
in
response
to
the
interim
report,
numerous
railroads
filed
verified
statements
and
briefs,
some
supporting
the
proposed
rules
and
others
opposing
them.
several
railroads
requested
oral
hearings,
including
both
appellees
here.
seaboard,
in
its
statement
to
the
commission,
primarily
argued
that
the
commission
should
not
impose
incentive
charges
on
plain
boxcars
without
also
imposing
them
on
specially
equipped
cars.
mr.
samuel
huntington
well,
in
our
view,
it’s
not
so
much
a
question
of
fact
as
it
is
a
question
of
the
proper
standard
to
be
applied
in
determining
prejudice.
our
primary
argument
on
that
point,
which
i
will
come
to
in
due
course,
is
that
the
district
court
simply
applied
the
wrong
standard.
well,
florida
east
coast
did
file
two
verified
statements
setting
forth
its
position
on
the
rules
in
some
detail,
and
it
also
requested
an
oral
hearing
and
it
specified
four
factors
which
it
would--
intended
to
show
at
the
oral
hearing,
and
i
will
also
discuss
those.
while
in
april
1970,
the
commission
entered
its
final
report
and
adopted
the
rules
virtually
in
the
same
form
as
had
been
proposed
in
the
interim
report.
the
commission
specifically
answered
and
rejected
the
policy
arguments
advanced
by
seaboard
and
florida
east
coast
for
not
applying
the
rules
to
them.
it
had
also
rejected
all
the
requests
for
oral
hearing
on
the
grounds
that
no
party
showed
prejudice.
both
seaboard
and
florida
east
coast
then
brought
actions
in
the
florida
district
court
and
the
district
court
set
aside
the
commission’s
order
for
failure
to
hold
oral
hearings.
the
appellees
based
their
claim
to
an
oral
hearing
in
addition
to
one
of
the
provision
of
section
114
(a).
they
place
their
claim
on
section
556
(d)
of
the
administrative
procedure
act.
that
section
provides
that,
in
rule
making,
“an
agency
may,
when
a
party
will
not
be
prejudice
thereby,
adopt
procedures
for
the
submission
of
oral
or
part
of
the
evidence
in
written
form.”
the
appellees
claim
that
they
showed
prejudice
in
their
submissions
to
the
commission.
before
reaching
this
issue
though,
there
is
a
threshold
issue
of
whether
section
556
(d)
applies
at
all
to
this
rule
making
proceeding.
now,
section
553
of
the
administrative
procedure
act
sets
forth
the
basic
procedural
requirements
for
rule
making,
and
section
553
(c)
requires
agencies
to
give
interested
parties
“an
opportunity
to
submit
written
data,
views,
or
arguments
with
or
without
opportunity
for
oral
presentation.”
clearly,
this
was
done
in
this
case
by
the
commission.
section
553
(c),
however,
goes
on
to
state
that
“when
rules
are
required
by
statute
to
be
made
on
the
record
after
an
opportunity
for
agency
hearing,
sections
556
and
557
apply
instead
of
this
subsection.”
now,
section
114
(a)
of
the
interstate
commerce
act,
under
which
the
rules
here
were
promulgated,
requires
a
hearing
but
it
no
where
states
that
the
commission’s
decision
must
be
on
the
record
of
that
hearing.
now,
unless
the
“on
the
record”
requirement
can
be
inferred
from
the
context
of
the
statute,
sections
556
and
557
of
the
administrative
procedure
would
not
apply
to
this
case.
now,
this
precise
issue
was
decided
by
this
court
in
the
allegheny-ludlum
case
last
year.
in
the
applicable
passage
this
court
stated,
we
do
not
suggest
that
only
the
precise
words
on
the
record
in
the
applicable
statute
will
suffice
to
make
sections
556
and
557
applicable
to
rule
making
proceedings,
but
we
do
hold
that
the
language
of
the
esch
car
service
act,
which
is
section
114
(a),
is
insufficient
to
invoke
these
sections.
mr.
samuel
huntington
well,
they
do
and
our
response
to
that
is
that
the
1966
amendment
simply
builds
on
what
was
there
before
and
it
does
require
the
commission
to
take
into
account
certain
factors
before
imposing
an
incentive
element
but,
in
no
way,
suggested
that,
in
considering
those
factors,
the
commission
must
do
so
only
on
the
basis
of
the
record.
the
hearing
requirement
whether
you’re
considering
a
proceeding
as
in
allegheny
under
the
first--
in
allegheny-ludlum
under
the
first
part
of
the
statute
or
whether
you’re
considering
incentive
per
diem
proceedings.
under
the
second
part,
the
hearing
requirement
is
the
same,
and
that
requirement
is
imposed
in
the
very
beginning
of
the
statute.
in
short,
we
believe
that
the
allegheny-ludlum
holding
is
controlling
here,
but
i’d
like
to
turn
now
to
the
second
part
of
our
argument
which
assumes
that
section
556
does
apply
to
this
proceeding.
in
that
event,
the
commission
was
justified
in
doing
away
and
not
having--
not
holding
oral
hearings
unless
appellees
have
established
before
the
commission
that
they
would
be
prejudiced
by
the
absence
of
an
oral
hearing.
the
critical
question
here
then
is
what
showing
is
necessary
to
establish
prejudice
and
did
appellees
make
that
showing.
in
our
view,
there
are
two
basic
tests
that
a
request
for
oral
hearing
must
meet
to
establish
prejudice.
and
getting
back
to
your
question,
mr.
chief
justice,
we
would
maintain
that
the
district
court
did
not
apply
these
tests.
therefore,
its
finding
of
prejudice
was
based
on
an
erroneous
standard
and
is
not
a
finding
of
fact
which
this
court
should
defer
to.
the
first
and
most
obvious
test
is
that
the
request
must
show
a
need
to
establish
facts
in
an
oral
hearing
that
could
not
be
adequately
established
through
written
submissions.
both
appellees
have
failed
to
meet
this
initial
test.
florida
east
coast’s
basic
opposition
to
the
rules
stems
from
the
fact
that
it
is
located
on
a
peninsula
and
terminates
far
more
plain
boxcar
traffic
than
it
originates,
and
because
a
lot
of
the
traffic
terminates
in
the
southern
part
of
florida
as
the
verified
statements
submitted
shows,
the
railroad
must
continue
to
pay
per
diem
charges
until
it
can
get
the
unloaded
boxcars
back
to
the
northern
part
of
its
line
and
on
to
a
connecting
railroad.
florida
east
coast
argues
that
because
it
owns
sufficient
plain
boxcars
to
satisfy
the
limited
needs
of
its
shippers
for
plain
boxcars
and
because
it
operates
an
efficient
operation
and
generally
returns
empty
cars
as
fast
as
it
can,
the
incentive
per
diem
rules
would
neither
prompt
it
to
purchase
new
cars
nor
result
in
the
faster
return
of
freight
cars
and,
therefore,
the
rule
shouldn’t
be
applied
to
them.
while
this
argument
shows
that
the
application
of
the
rules
may
not
be
in
florida
east
coast’s
best
interest,
they
do
not
show
that
an
oral
hearing
was
necessary
to
establish
these
facts.
in
fact,
these
facts
i’ve
just
outlined
were
set
forth
in
verified
statements
in
some
detail
submitted
by
florida
east
coast,
and
the
commission’s
final
report
shows
that
it
considered
the
arguments
advanced
by
florida
east
coast,
these
policy
arguments,
and
it
considered
the
verified
statements
but
concluded
that
an
exemption
from
the
incentive
rules
for
all
terminating
roads
would
not
be
in
the
public
interest.
now,
seaboard’s
basic
opposition
to
the
rules
is
based
on
its
ownership
of
a
large
number
of
specially
equipped
boxcars
to
which
the
rules
do
not
apply.
although
seaboard
did
not
submit
any
verified
statements,
it
has
made
no
showing
that
it
could
not
have
established
this
fact
by
written
submissions
and
that
it
has
made
no
showing
that
an
oral
hearing
was
necessary
here.
now,
perhaps
recognizing
that
an
oral
hearing
was
not
necessary
to
establish
the
adverse
effect
of
the
rules
on
them,
both
railroads
argue
that
an
oral
hearing
was
necessary
to
cross-examine
commission
personnel
on
the
preparation
an
analysis
of
the
freight
car
study.
here
too,
however,
appellees
could
have
challenged
the
commission’s
conclusion
from
the
study
by
written
submission
and
arguments.
the
appendices
to
the
commission’s
interim
report
set
forth
in
plain
terms
the
methodology
of
the
study.
no
one
has
suggested
that
this
methodology
was
unsound.
i’d
like
to
quote
from
the--
a
verified
statement
submitted
by
the
penn
central,
this
is
on
page
151
of
the
appendix,
where
the
penn
central
concedes
the
study
data
appears
to
have
been
gathered
by
recognized
methods
of
sampling
and
statistical
techniques.
penn
central
then
goes
on
to
quibble
with
the
conclusions
reached
by
the
commission.
i
don’t
understand
appellees
to
suggest
that
the
statistical
method
used
here
were
inappropriate.
with
this
challenge,
the
commission’s
conclusions
from
the
tables
and
graphs
that
the
incentive
per
diem
rule
should
be
adopted
to
improve
the
utilization
and
supply
of
freight
cars.
they
challenge
the
analysis
that
the
commission
made
from
the
data
and
the
commission’s
conclusion
that
there
was
indeed
a
national
shortage
of
freight
cars
and
that
the
rules
reasonably
adopted
to
combat
that
shortage.
well,
if
appellees
believe
that
the
conclusions
are
unsound,
their
remedy
is
not
to
cross-examine
commission
personnel
who
assisted
the
commission
in
analyzing
these
data
as
part
of
the
decision
making
process.
their
remedy
is
to
analyze
the
data
on
their
own,
as
i
stated
before,
the
data
were
available
to
them,
and
on
the
basis
of
their
own
analysis
to
argue
against
the
commission’s
conclusions
or,
for
that
matter,
they
could
start
with
the
commission
tables
and
graphs
in
the
interim
report
and
argue
that
the
commission’s
conclusions
based
on
that
data
were
inappropriate.
mr.
samuel
huntington
well,
they
have
not
chosen
to
do
that,
other
than
to--
well,
i’ll
backtrack
a
little
bit.
florida
east
coast
does
challenge
the
way
in
which
part
of
the
data
was
obtained
and
that
is
when
i
said
that
the
reports
submitted
to
the
railroads
required
each
freight
station
to
list
the
number
of
cars
ordered
by
shippers
for
placement
on
or
before
the
study
date.
florida
east
coast
maintains
that
it’s
unreasonable
to
include
in
the
orders,
orders
which
were
received
on
the
study
day
for
placement
that
day
and
this,
i
think
you
probably--
can
properly
be
construed
as
an
attack
on
the
method
of
the
study.
i
think
the
commission
recognized
that
this
perhaps
was
a
deficiency
in
the
study.
in
fact,
they
proposed
a
further
study
in
1969,
which
was
opposed
by
both
railroads,
in
which
they
would
have
remedied
that
particular
point
and
they
would’ve
only
listed
as
orders,
orders
received
by
the
beginning
of
the
study
day
for
placement
on
or
before
the
study
day
and
would
not
have
included
orders
received
on
the
study
day
for
placement
that
day.
but,
to
the
extent
that
florida
east
coast
wants
to
establish
that,
that’s
conceded
that
there
is
a
deficiency
there.
well,
the
second
basic
test
that
a
party
must
show,
as
you
remember,
i
said
there
were
two
tests.
the
second
basic
test
they
must
show
to
show
prejudice
from
the
absence
of
an
oral
hearing
is
to
show
that
the
facts
it
desires
to
establish
at
an
oral
hearing
are
material
and
have
a
reasonable
chance
of
influencing
the
commission
in
reaching
its
decision.
with
respect
to
their
asserted
need
to
cross-examine
commission
personnel,
both
appellees
have
completely
failed
this
test.
seaboard
has
failed
to
indicate
in
any
way
what
facts
it
would
wish
to
establish.
florida
east
coast,
on
its
part,
did
list
what
it
hoped
to
establish.
one
thing
it
did
hope
to
establish
was
this
24-hour
business
about
freight
cars
ordered
for
placement
on
the
study
day.
the
other
“facts”
that
it
wished
to
establish
were:
(1)
that
the
deficiencies
reported
in
the
study
“may
not”
be
affected
by
the
supply
of
cars
in
other
regions,
(2)
that
the
addition
of
new
plain
boxcars
“would
necessarily”
reduce
the
number
of
deficiencies,
and
(3)
that
no
one
could
tell
exactly
how
many
boxcars
were
needed.
i
believe
it’s
highly
unlikely
that
the
establishment
of
these
facts
would
have
surprised
or
impressed
the
commission.
the
commission,
throughout
its
report,
does
not
contend
that
they’re
operating
on
a
perfect
set
of
data
here
whether
they
can
guarantee
that
the
rules
they’re
adopting
will
in
fact
work.
what
they
are
saying,
what
the
commission
did
say,
is
that
we
have
this
balanced
statistical
evidence
that,
in
our
best
judgment,
this
evidence
shows
that
there
is
a
shortage
and,
in
our
best
judgment,
the
proper
way
to
go
about
it
is
by
trying
these
incentive
rules.
the
commission
said
that
the
rules
were
designed
“to
test
whether
a
financial
incentive
can
be
employed
to
augment
the
car
fleet.”
this
is
in
the
nature
of
an
experiment.
the
commission,
at
several
points,
said
that
the
proceedings
would
remain
open
and
that
the
rules
could
be
revised
in
view
of
the
experience
of
the
railroads
after
they
had
been
in
effect.
mr.
samuel
huntington
well,
i
think
had
to--
had
it
rule--
at
this
point,
the
rules
are,
in
effect,
against--
apply
to
every
railroad
in
the
country
except
florida
east
coast
and
seaboard.
so,
a
remand
would
just
involve
those
two
railroads
so
i
cannot
say
that
the
delay
would
be
a
matter
of
a
tremendous
significance
to
the
entire
country,
but
they
would--
these
hearings
do
drag
on
and
if
it
gets
into
a
battle
of
expert
witnesses
over
the
proper
interpretation
to
be
given
a
set
of
data,
i
believe,
there
could
be
quite
a
substantial
delay.
mr.
samuel
huntington
i
think,
probably,
years.
mr.
samuel
huntington
well,
i
could
backtrack
on
what
i
said
a
minute
ago.
i
think
we
have
stated
out
in
our--
stated
in
our
jurisdictional
statement
that
if
oral
hearings
are
held,
the
other
railroads
would
be
likely
to
seek
to
intervene
and
that
it
probably
would,
and
the
whole
proceeding
probably
would
be
reopened
and
it
might
be
a
very
protracted
proceeding
indeed.
mr.
samuel
huntington
well,
i
think
that
might
be
one
factor.
another
factor
is
the
commission’s
statement
that
the
proceeding
would
remain
open
and,
in
fact,
i
understand
from
the
commission
that
there
are
petitioners
before
the
commission
right
now
seeking
to
reopen
the
proceeding
and
seeking
to
modify
the
rules.
mr.
samuel
huntington
yes,
the
rest
of
the--
the
rules
have
been
applied
since
september
1,
1970
to
the
rest
of
the
railroads
in
the
country.
mr.
samuel
huntington
how
many
were
appearing?
well,
there
were
a
group
of
railroads.
the
aar,
the
american
association
of
railroads,
there’s
a
shipping
interest
and--
mr.
samuel
huntington
yes,
there
were
multiple
parties
and
numerous
verified
statements,
and
the
proceedings
went
on
for
some
time.
mr.
samuel
huntington
some
of
them
were,
yes.
there,
the
issue
is
not
procedural.
the
issue
there
was
the
underlying
reasonableness
of
the
rules.
well,
finally,
we
suggest
that
if
the
court
agrees
with
us
that
an
oral
hearing
was
not
required
here,
the
court
should
affirm
the
commission’s
order
outright
without
remanding
to
the
district
court
for
consideration
of
other
issues.
now,
the
district
court,
in
deciding
that
an
oral
hearing
was
necessary,
did
not
reach
several
other
issues
raised
by
appellees
and
these
issues,
basically,
are
whether
the
commission
complied
with
all
the
requirements
of
114
(a),
whether
the
rules
are
reasonable,
and
whether
florida
east
coast
should
be
exempted
as
a
terminating
road.
now,
the
reason
we
suggested
that
remand
is
not
necessary
is
we
believe
that
a--
that
these
issues
are
not
substantial.
we
believe
that
the--
a
reading
of
the
allegheny-ludlum
opinion
and
a
reading
of
the
commission
reports
and
keeping
in
mind
the
very
limited
scope
of
review
which
the
allegheny-ludlum
case
underscored,
that
the
rule
should
be
simply
upheld
in
their
entirety
by
this
court.
and
then,
finally,
for
the
reasons
set
forth
at
pages
28-30
of
our
brief,
and
i
won’t
go
into
them
here,
we
urge
that
appellee
should
be
ordered
to
make
restitution
of
the
incentive
charges
that
would’ve
paid
other
railroads
but
for
the
restraining
order
and
injunction
entered
by
the
district
court.
in
conclusion,
we
respectfully
submit
that
the
judgment
below
should
be
reversed.
mr.
samuel
huntington
thank
you.
the--
i’d
first
like
to
correct
one
statement
i
made
in
response
to
a
question
by
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
the
commission
does
not
concede
that
the
method
of
reporting
orders
on
its
study
was
deficient,
and
this
point
is
addressed
in
a
response
to
an
inquiry
by
the
railroads
while
the
freight
car
was--
while
the
study
was
being
done,
and
that
response
is
found
at
pages
189-190
of
the
appendix
and
i’ll
simply
refer
the
court
to
that.
on
the
existence
of
the
shortage
and
on
most
of
mr.
hollander’s
points
about
whether
the
commission
did
in
fact
comply
with
the
standards
of
section
114
(a),
i
refer
the
court
to
the
interim
report
and,
specifically,
to
pages
66
(a)-70
(a)
of
the
jurisdictional
statement
appendix.
there,
the--
that’s
the
critical
part
of
the
interim
report.
it’s
in
appendix
a
and,
there,
the
court
analyzes
in
considerable
detail
and
shows
exactly
the
steps
it
goes
through
in
concluding
that
there
is
a
shortage
and
that
the
percent
of
the
rule
should
be
adopted
to
combat
that
shortage.
to
the
extent,
of
course,
that
there
is
further
evidence
that,
now,
that
maybe
the
shortage
isn’t
as
bad
or
maybe
it’s
worse,
of
course
that
can
be
submitted
to
the
commission
now.
i
just
also
like
to
point
out
that
the--
in
addition
to
these
petitions
which
are
now
pending,
the
american
association
of
railroads
did
petition
for
modification
of
the
rule
some
time
ago
asking
that
the
funds
collected
from
the
incentive
per
diem
charges
be
available
for
leasing
cars
in
addition
to
purchasing
new
cars,
and
the
commission
now
has
that
and
will
probably
come
out
with
a
decision
in
the
not
too
distant
future.
finally,
in
response
to
a
point
mr.
justice
white
made,
the
allegheny-ludlum
case,
and
this
case
involved
precisely
the
same
section
of
the
interstate
commerce
act
and
the
same
hearing
requirement,
it’s
that--
it’s
the
third
and
fourth
word
in
the
section
114
(a)
and,
therefore,
we
say
that
the
requirement
should
not
be
different
in
one
proceeding
than
it
is
in
this
proceeding.
