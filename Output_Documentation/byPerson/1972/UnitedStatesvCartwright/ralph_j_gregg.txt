mr.
ralph
j.
gregg
the
counsel
for
the
government
has
argued
on
the
premise
that
the
sole
issue
to
be
decided
here
is
the
validity
of
the
regulation.
a
mere
rebuttal
of
this
would
be
apt.
i’m
sure
to
only
lead
the
court
with
a
rather
narrow
and
somewhat
blurred
vision
on
what
this
case
is
all
about.
the
real
issues
are
factual.
were
the
shares
owned
by
mr.
bennett
at
the
time
of
her
death
worth
a
$124,000?
that
being
the
amount
she
could
have
sold
them
for,
or
where
they
worth
a
$133,000?
that
being
the
amount
the
executor
would
have
had
to
pay
a
broker
to
purchase
as
many
additional
sales
as
she
already
owned.
and
thirdly,
was
the
$9,000
difference,
that
being
the
amount
going
to
the
broker,
an
asset
of
mrs.
bennett’s
estate?
it
seems
to
me
that
the
regulation
must
stand
or
follow
and
the
answers
to
those
questions.
then
there’s
also
the
constitutional
question
if
the
commissioner
may
by
regulation
deprive
taxpayers
of
due
process
of
law
by
fixing
a
value,
an
arbitrate
value
that
precludes
the
consideration
of
any
other
relevant
facts.
i
hope
in
a
matter
of
10
or
12
minutes
to
give
the
court,
the
benefit
i
hope
of
a
more
broader
perspective
of
the
mutual
fund
issue.
it
was
in
1962,
that
i
first
became
involved
in
the
mutual
fund
issue,
first
on
behalf
of
a
town
police
officer,
and
then
on
the
estate
of
my
high
school
homeroom
teacher.
other
cases
came
along
quickly
because
beginning
in
61
and
62,
revenue
agents
were
raising
the
same
issue
in
every
estate
on
mutual
fund
shares.
we
soon
discovered
that
it
was
useless
to
argue
with
revenue
agents.
they
--
even
though
they
privately
agreed
with
us,
they
said
their
orders
had
come
from
washington.
there
was
no
one
to
appeal
to
inside
the
treasury
department.
so
what
we
did
was
to
pay
and
sue
for
refunds
in
the
district
courts.
we
didn’t
have
to
try
those
cases
because
as
the
counsel
for
the
government
agrees,
the
department
of
justice
agreed
with
us
and
ordered
--
or
instructed
the
irs
to
refund
our
money.
but
this
was
all
prior
to
act
1211
1963.
there
really
wasn’t
much
of
an
issue
to
be
tried
on
those
days.
there
was
no
doubt
then
as
there’s
no
doubt
today
about
the
value
of
a
mutual
funds
here.
it’s
the
amount
the
shareholder
can
sell
it
for
by
asking
the
company
for
his
money
and
the
amount
is
guaranteed.
mr.
ralph
j.
gregg
no,
sir.
he
would
not.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
if
you
bought
a
brand
new
cadillac
and
you
didn’t
even
take
it
out
of
its
showroom
and
called
up
another
cadillac
dealer
and
asked
him
how
much
he’d
give
it
to
you,
you’d
still
get
a
second-hand
car
price.
mr.
ralph
j.
gregg
yes,
sir.
by
all
means.
mr.
ralph
j.
gregg
no
possible
way.
mr.
ralph
j.
gregg
that
would
depend
sir,
would
it,
on
whether
or
not
the
retail
dealer
required
the
fellow
to
take
delivery.
mr.
ralph
j.
gregg
in
that
case,
it
would
be
a
used
car
if
he
begged
off
and
--
mr.
ralph
j.
gregg
then
he
has
a
brand
new
car
which
he
has
bought
taken
title
to
becomes
a
second-hand
automobile.
if
he
calls
up
the
--
mr.
ralph
j.
gregg
it
might
very
well.
but
the
dealer
would
certainly
say
to
him.
i’ve
sold
you
the
car.
i
got
my
commission.
i
got
23
other
cadillac
just
like
it
sitting
up
in
a
lot.
i
got
to
pay
my
salesman
to
sell
those.
i
can’t
give
you
all
your
money
back.
if
you’re
going
to
give
him
all
his
money
back,
you
wouldn’t
have
sued
him
in
the
first
place.
and
this
test
that
i
am
talking
about
for
mutual
fund
shares
what
they’re
worth
is
exactly
the
same
test
that
they
use
for
determining
the
value
of
a
general
motors
for
example.
it’s
what
the
shareholder
can
sell
it
for.
the
amount
revenue
agents
were
talking
about
was
the
amount
that
will
cost
the
executor
to
purchase
his
many
additional
shares
as
the
decedent
already
had.
paying
a
broker,
an
8%
commission
for
shares
the
decedent
didn’t
--
mr.
ralph
j.
gregg
if
you
say
--
if
you
have
to
pay
for
it
sir
--
your
honor?
mr.
ralph
j.
gregg
if
you
own
a
share.
mr.
ralph
j.
gregg
i’m
sure
that’s
true
because
if
i
say
to
my
broker,
i’d
like
to
sell
the
share
--
mr.
ralph
j.
gregg
i
agree
with
you
100%.
mr.
ralph
j.
gregg
the
what
one?
mr.
ralph
j.
gregg
no,
it
isn’t
that.
under
the
cases,
only
if
it’s
necessary.
only
if
the
--
if
you’re
paid
on
the
higher
price,
pay
the
estate
tax
on
the
higher
price,
you
have
a
higher
basis.
if
it’s
then
sold
by
the
executor
in
order
to
and
it’s
necessary
to
affect
the
administration
and
everything
of
that
character.
the
treasury
says
you
may
deduct
the
administration
expense
but
you’ll
find
it
in
all
the
cases,
they’re
bitterly
opposing
the
deduction
on
the
grounds
it
wasn’t
necessary
to
affect
administration
or
to
affect
distribution
or
to
pay
expenses.
it’s
a
capital
loss
and
i
don’t
see
how
the
government
says
you
can
take
it
as
an
administration
expense
in
an
estate.
mr.
ralph
j.
gregg
not
at
all.
not
necessary
for
the
administration
to
affect
distribution.
just
as
you
say
if
you
tell
your
broker
to
sell
your
share
of
general
motors
and
other
fellow
says
to
buy
one
and
the
sale
takes
place
at
a
$100.
that’s
the
price
at
which
the
share
changed
hands
between
a
willing
buyer
and
a
willing
seller
under
the
regulation.
one
fellow
gets
only
98
and
the
other
pays
a
102.
but
the
commissions
paid
are
immaterial
on
the
question
of
value
and
the
commissioner
agrees.
but
you
see
here,
he
wants
to
add
the
purchasing
commission.
mr.
ralph
j.
gregg
that’s
the
lifeblood
of
the
whole
industry
during
the
past
year
for
example,
the
number
of
sales
at
the
redemption
price
for
many
months
exceeded
purchases
at
the
public
offering
place.
this
is
continuous
in
their
sales
in
both
markets
but
the
only
market
to
which
mrs.
bennett
had
access
or
her
executor
was
the
bid
price
market.
the
amount
she
could
sell
it
for.
mr.
ralph
j.
gregg
yes,
yes,
mr.
justice.
i
think,
i
find
it
quite
well
in
the
brief
that
the
only
difference
really
between
the
prices
of
which
mutual
fund
share
sell
and
those
who
have
listed
corporations
or
the
way
they’re
reported
in
the
paper,
ones
reported
with
a
purchasing
commission,
the
others
are
reported
without
any
reference
to
purchasing
commissions.
and
that’s
why
–
but
the
only
difference
between
the
two,
that’s
why
this
regulation
around
arouse
such
bitter
opposition
among
the
taxpayers,
their
lawyers
and
accountants
because
it
seemed
to
them
that
the
government
was
merely
sleeping
over
on
them
the
use
of
the
wrong
price
as
quoted
in
the
financial
pages
of
the
paper.
now,
there
was
no
doubt
in
my
mind
that
the
commissioner
was
going
to
lose
this
argument
if
the
question
is,
what’s
the
value
of
the
mutual
fund
share?
and
i
dare
say
that
this
case
wouldn’t
be
before
this
court
today
except
for
one
thing.
the
commissioner
has
a
very
powerful
weapon
to
use
in
such
situations.
it’s
a
regulation.
a
regulation
gives
the
commissioner
an
overwhelming
advantage.
first
of
all,
he
has
the
choice
of
weapons.
he
can
choose
the
court
he
wants
the
case
he
wants
to
try
and
the
court
to
try
it
in.
the
taxpayer
has
none
of
these
choices.
value
becomes
a
secondary
issue.
the
taxpayer
now
has
the
burden
of
proving
that
the
commissioner’s
regulation
is
completely
unreasonable,
arbitrary,
and
capricious.
and
to
top
it
off,
the
commissioner
has
the
presumption,
a
judicial
presumption
that
he
is
right
and
the
taxpayer
is
wrong.
this
isn’t
an
isolated
instance
in
which
the
commissioner
has
used
his
regulations
in
order
to
put
the
taxpayer
to
disadvantage.
he
did
it
with
the
second
class
of
stock
regulations
under
the
--
for
professional
corporations.
his
(inaudible)
regulations
for
professional
corporations.
his
business
expense
regulations
under
section
274
just
to
mention
a
few
that
had
been
struck
down
recently
by
the
lower
courts
and
he
is
even
now
doing
it
with
this
section
42
regulations
on
multiple
corporations
where
again
the
taxpayer
is
going
to
have
a
very
difficult
burden
of
proving
that
a
purely
arbitrary
did
reallocation
of
income
or
expense
is
so
arbitrary
as
to
be
completely
unreasonable.
mr.
ralph
j.
gregg
yes,
sir.
mr.
ralph
j.
gregg
no,
your
honor.
without
subtracting
or
adding
commissions
of
any
kind,
is
the
price
at
which
--
mr.
ralph
j.
gregg
at
a
$100.
oh!
yes.
mr.
ralph
j.
gregg
forget
about
the
commissions
of
the
regulations.
forget
about
them
completely.
they
never
have
included
--
mr.
ralph
j.
gregg
absolutely
correct.
mr.
ralph
j.
gregg
because
they’ve
added
the
purchasing
commission.
and
in
a
normal
transaction
for
list
--
maybe
i
can
express
it,
if
i
don’t
say
it
right
this
time.
let’s
take
the
$5
million
portfolio
of
a
rich
man
on
a
common
stocks.
he
pays
a
tax
on
a
100%
of
what
those
shares
can
be
sold
for
regardless
of
commissions.
here,
the
government
has
ruled
the
small
investor
and
the
mutual
fund
must
pay
a
tax
on
a
108%
of
the
amount
for
which
they
could
be
sold.
this
i
say
is
wrong.
mr.
ralph
j.
gregg
that’s
all
you
can
get
your
honor.
mr.
ralph
j.
gregg
of
practicality,
as
a
matter
of
fact.
mr.
ralph
j.
gregg
that’s
when
you
purchase.
but
what
i
can
get
--
mr.
ralph
j.
gregg
8%
as
a
purchasing
commission
on
small
share
levels.
it
drops
to
4%
then
to
1%
in
the
large
practice.
but
that’s
purchasing.
what
i
can
get
is
only
the
net
asset
value
and
it’s
stipulated
that
the
only
practical
method
of
getting
your
money
is
to
turn
them
into
the
investment
company.
mr.
ralph
j.
gregg
no,
sir.
i
must
have
misspoken
your
honor.
it’s
whether
you
dispose
off
the
stock
or
not
to
put
it
in
trust
is
the
question,
what
are
they
worth
in
the
date
of
death?
the
$5
million
--
of
common
stocks.
they’re
valued
at
a
100%
of
what
they
could
be
sold
for
on
the
market
with
commissions
cutting
always
either
way.
but
here,
the
government
is
saying
that
this
small
investor
in
mutual
funds
must
pay
a
tax
on
108%
of
what
they
can
realize.
mr.
ralph
j.
gregg
small
or
large.
mr.
ralph
j.
gregg
correct.
mr.
ralph
j.
gregg
without
charge.
mr.
ralph
j.
gregg
correct.
mr.
ralph
j.
gregg
you
do.
mr.
ralph
j.
gregg
that’s
the
2%
i
was
talking
about.
mr.
ralph
j.
gregg
you
also
pay
a
2%
commission.
mr.
ralph
j.
gregg
correct.
mr.
ralph
j.
gregg
i
see.
when
a
regulation
has
been
issued
the
taxpayer
job
isn’t
very
easy.
he
has
the
court
to
explore
the
facts
and
decide
the
case
on
its
merits.
the
government’s
position
however,
is
that
the
only
issue
to
be
decided
in
a
vacuum
is
the
validity
of
the
regulation.
and
it
reminds
the
court
that
if
there’s
at
least
some
plausible
grounds
or
rational
basis
for
the
commissioner’s
decision.
it
must
be
sustained.
here
the
government
has
offered
in
its
brief
and
verbally
three
and
assortment
of
gift
tax
cases
as
lending
that
plausibility,
guggenheim
gift
tax
cases,
etcetera.
for
what
connection
is
there
really
between
gifts
to
single
premium
life
insurance
policies
and
life
of
another,
gifts
of
diamond
rings
subject
to
luxury,
wartime
or
excise
taxes.
i
think
that
these
arguments
have
to
be
recognized
for
what
they
really
are.
a
diversionary
tactic
to
persuade
the
court
that
the
commissioner
wasn’t
totally
unreasonable,
then
having
gotten
all
of
the
plausibility
mileage
out
of
these
and
other
equally
far
fetched
analogies
like
blackacre,
etcetera.
i
think,
then
the
government
puts
great
emphasis
i
think
on
the
duty
of
the
court
to
defer
to
the
judgment
of
the
court
defer
to
the
judgment
of
the
commissioner
in
choosing
between
so-called
reasonable
alternatives
citing
united
states
versus
correll
and
bingler
versus
johnson.
but
again,
what
do
those
cases
have
to
do
with
mutual
funds
shares?
and
one
of
the
question
was
when
is
the
businessman
out
of
town,
and
the
other,
what
fellowships
and
scholarships
are
exempt
from
income
tax?
in
both,
there
are
any
numbers
of
definitions,
some
good,
some
better,
one
perhaps
the
best.
and
understandably,
the
court
was
reluctant
to
superimpose
its
judgment
on
that
of
the
taxpayer
and
those
cases.
but
this
isn’t
a
good,
better,
or
best
situation.
it’s
a
good
or
bad.
it’s
reasonable
or
unreasonable
situation.
if
mrs.
bennett
shares
are
worth
$124,000
they
couldn’t
possibly
have
been
worth
the
$133,000.
if
the
$9,000
difference
was
payable
--
if
her
broker
would
get
that,
it
certainly
was
an
asset
of
her
estate.
and
then
as
i
pointed
out
before
with
some
exemptions,
mutual
funds
are
held
by
people
of
matter.
it
means
the
middle
class
investor.
the
rich
man
with
the
portfolio
as
i
said
of
a
million
dollars
worth
of
securities
and
common
stocks
listed
on
the
exchanges.
he
pays
on
the
estate
tax
based
on
the
net
asset
value
of
his
portfolio.
but
the
government
has
ruled
here
that
the
small
investor
must
pay
a
tax
on
a
108%
of
the
net
asset
value
of
his
portfolio.
i
don’t
see
how
the
commissioner
justifies
this
discrimination
and
i
would
surmise
that
that’s
why
the
government
didn’t
ask
congress
for
a
blessing
on
this
new
regulation.
he
might
have
been
reminded
that
congress
in
passing
the
investment
company
act
of
1940
was
recognizing
an
important
public
need
for
a
well
regulated
investment
medium
for
the
small
investor.
and
he
might
have
been
told
that
it
wasn’t
proper
to
penalize
him
for
investing
in
the
open-end
investment
company
shares
that
were
provided
but
that
legislation.
incidentally,
counsel
for
the
investment
company
institute
as
amicus
has
given
the
court
authoritative
intelligent,
informative
brief
as
amicus
explaining
the
close-end
and
open-end
investment
companies,
load
funds,
no
load
funds,
how
the
estate
tax
regulation
ignores
the
realities
of
the
market
place
and
in
addition,
rather
senselessly
discriminates
against
the
holders
of
the
load
fund
shareholders.
our
position
is
that
the
commissioner
in
promulgating
this
regulation
was
completely
unrealistic
and
arbitrary
and
unfair.
by
arbitrarily
assigning
of
value
of
here
to
these
years
which
the
estate
could
never
get
under
any
circumstances
at
a
price
that
precludes
consideration
of
any
other
relevant
facts
which
is
required
by
his
own
regulations.
we
think
that
he
deprives
the
taxpayer’s
due
process
a
lot
and
that’s
why
on
behalf
of
the
many
thousands
of
executors
and
their
attorneys
for
whom
i
happen
but
by
sheer
chance
today
to
be
spokesman.
i
respectfully
urge
this
court
to
agree
with
the
federal
judge
of
my
district
and
the
judges
of
the
second
circuit
court
of
appeals
that
that
value
of
mrs.
bennett
shares
was
a
$124,000
and
that
the
commissioner
was
completely
unrealistic,
unreasonable,
and
arbitrary
in
saying
that
her
estate
should
have
to
pay
a
tax
of
$9,000
next
to
$9,000
that
even
the
government
admits
her
estate
could
never
get
for
them.
mr.
ralph
j.
gregg
i
didn’t.
it’s
the
government
who
takes
that
the
opposite
positions.
they
value
--
the
gm
share
at
100.
they
value
--
mr.
ralph
j.
gregg
i
certainly
am.
mr.
ralph
j.
gregg
if
they
said
you
got
to
value
that
general
motor
share
at
a
hundred
plus
the
2%
purchasing
commission.
in
other
words,
the
replacement
costs
i
would
disagree
with
them
and
they
be
disagreeing
with
their
own
regulations
because
for
time
and
memorial,
they
have
set
the
value
of
a
general
motor
share
is
100
not
a
102.
but
they
say
that
a
value
of
a
mutual
fund
share
is
not
100,
it’s
a
108.
mr.
ralph
j.
gregg
it
so
happens
that
with
ids
there
is
no
selling
commission
or
redemption
charge.
so
that
i
actually
do
in
fact
get
100.
with
the
gm
situation,
i
actually
get
only
98
but
i
agree
that
the
price
at
which
the
shares
change
hands
was
a
100
and
that
that
is
the
fair
market
value
for
estate
tax
purposes.
mr.
ralph
j.
gregg
the
counsel
for
the
government
has
argued
on
the
premise
that
the
sole
issue
to
be
decided
here
is
the
validity
of
the
regulation.
a
mere
rebuttal
of
this
would
be
apt.
i’m
sure
to
only
lead
the
court
with
a
rather
narrow
and
somewhat
blurred
vision
on
what
this
case
is
all
about.
the
real
issues
are
factual.
were
the
shares
owned
by
mr.
bennett
at
the
time
of
her
death
worth
a
$124,000?
that
being
the
amount
she
could
have
sold
them
for,
or
where
they
worth
a
$133,000?
that
being
the
amount
the
executor
would
have
had
to
pay
a
broker
to
purchase
as
many
additional
sales
as
she
already
owned.
and
thirdly,
was
the
$9,000
difference,
that
being
the
amount
going
to
the
broker,
an
asset
of
mrs.
bennett’s
estate?
it
seems
to
me
that
the
regulation
must
stand
or
follow
and
the
answers
to
those
questions.
then
there’s
also
the
constitutional
question
if
the
commissioner
may
by
regulation
deprive
taxpayers
of
due
process
of
law
by
fixing
a
value,
an
arbitrate
value
that
precludes
the
consideration
of
any
other
relevant
facts.
i
hope
in
a
matter
of
10
or
12
minutes
to
give
the
court,
the
benefit
i
hope
of
a
more
broader
perspective
of
the
mutual
fund
issue.
it
was
in
1962,
that
i
first
became
involved
in
the
mutual
fund
issue,
first
on
behalf
of
a
town
police
officer,
and
then
on
the
estate
of
my
high
school
homeroom
teacher.
other
cases
came
along
quickly
because
beginning
in
61
and
62,
revenue
agents
were
raising
the
same
issue
in
every
estate
on
mutual
fund
shares.
we
soon
discovered
that
it
was
useless
to
argue
with
revenue
agents.
they
--
even
though
they
privately
agreed
with
us,
they
said
their
orders
had
come
from
washington.
there
was
no
one
to
appeal
to
inside
the
treasury
department.
so
what
we
did
was
to
pay
and
sue
for
refunds
in
the
district
courts.
we
didn’t
have
to
try
those
cases
because
as
the
counsel
for
the
government
agrees,
the
department
of
justice
agreed
with
us
and
ordered
--
or
instructed
the
irs
to
refund
our
money.
but
this
was
all
prior
to
act
1211
1963.
there
really
wasn’t
much
of
an
issue
to
be
tried
on
those
days.
there
was
no
doubt
then
as
there’s
no
doubt
today
about
the
value
of
a
mutual
funds
here.
it’s
the
amount
the
shareholder
can
sell
it
for
by
asking
the
company
for
his
money
and
the
amount
is
guaranteed.
mr.
ralph
j.
gregg
no,
sir.
he
would
not.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
if
you
bought
a
brand
new
cadillac
and
you
didn’t
even
take
it
out
of
its
showroom
and
called
up
another
cadillac
dealer
and
asked
him
how
much
he’d
give
it
to
you,
you’d
still
get
a
second-hand
car
price.
mr.
ralph
j.
gregg
yes,
sir.
by
all
means.
mr.
ralph
j.
gregg
no
possible
way.
mr.
ralph
j.
gregg
that
would
depend
sir,
would
it,
on
whether
or
not
the
retail
dealer
required
the
fellow
to
take
delivery.
mr.
ralph
j.
gregg
in
that
case,
it
would
be
a
used
car
if
he
begged
off
and
--
mr.
ralph
j.
gregg
then
he
has
a
brand
new
car
which
he
has
bought
taken
title
to
becomes
a
second-hand
automobile.
if
he
calls
up
the
--
mr.
ralph
j.
gregg
it
might
very
well.
but
the
dealer
would
certainly
say
to
him.
i’ve
sold
you
the
car.
i
got
my
commission.
i
got
23
other
cadillac
just
like
it
sitting
up
in
a
lot.
i
got
to
pay
my
salesman
to
sell
those.
i
can’t
give
you
all
your
money
back.
if
you’re
going
to
give
him
all
his
money
back,
you
wouldn’t
have
sued
him
in
the
first
place.
and
this
test
that
i
am
talking
about
for
mutual
fund
shares
what
they’re
worth
is
exactly
the
same
test
that
they
use
for
determining
the
value
of
a
general
motors
for
example.
it’s
what
the
shareholder
can
sell
it
for.
the
amount
revenue
agents
were
talking
about
was
the
amount
that
will
cost
the
executor
to
purchase
his
many
additional
shares
as
the
decedent
already
had.
paying
a
broker,
an
8%
commission
for
shares
the
decedent
didn’t
--
mr.
ralph
j.
gregg
if
you
say
--
if
you
have
to
pay
for
it
sir
--
your
honor?
mr.
ralph
j.
gregg
if
you
own
a
share.
mr.
ralph
j.
gregg
i’m
sure
that’s
true
because
if
i
say
to
my
broker,
i’d
like
to
sell
the
share
--
mr.
ralph
j.
gregg
i
agree
with
you
100%.
mr.
ralph
j.
gregg
the
what
one?
mr.
ralph
j.
gregg
no,
it
isn’t
that.
under
the
cases,
only
if
it’s
necessary.
only
if
the
--
if
you’re
paid
on
the
higher
price,
pay
the
estate
tax
on
the
higher
price,
you
have
a
higher
basis.
if
it’s
then
sold
by
the
executor
in
order
to
and
it’s
necessary
to
affect
the
administration
and
everything
of
that
character.
the
treasury
says
you
may
deduct
the
administration
expense
but
you’ll
find
it
in
all
the
cases,
they’re
bitterly
opposing
the
deduction
on
the
grounds
it
wasn’t
necessary
to
affect
administration
or
to
affect
distribution
or
to
pay
expenses.
it’s
a
capital
loss
and
i
don’t
see
how
the
government
says
you
can
take
it
as
an
administration
expense
in
an
estate.
mr.
ralph
j.
gregg
not
at
all.
not
necessary
for
the
administration
to
affect
distribution.
just
as
you
say
if
you
tell
your
broker
to
sell
your
share
of
general
motors
and
other
fellow
says
to
buy
one
and
the
sale
takes
place
at
a
$100.
that’s
the
price
at
which
the
share
changed
hands
between
a
willing
buyer
and
a
willing
seller
under
the
regulation.
one
fellow
gets
only
98
and
the
other
pays
a
102.
but
the
commissions
paid
are
immaterial
on
the
question
of
value
and
the
commissioner
agrees.
but
you
see
here,
he
wants
to
add
the
purchasing
commission.
mr.
ralph
j.
gregg
that’s
the
lifeblood
of
the
whole
industry
during
the
past
year
for
example,
the
number
of
sales
at
the
redemption
price
for
many
months
exceeded
purchases
at
the
public
offering
place.
this
is
continuous
in
their
sales
in
both
markets
but
the
only
market
to
which
mrs.
bennett
had
access
or
her
executor
was
the
bid
price
market.
the
amount
she
could
sell
it
for.
mr.
ralph
j.
gregg
yes,
yes,
mr.
justice.
i
think,
i
find
it
quite
well
in
the
brief
that
the
only
difference
really
between
the
prices
of
which
mutual
fund
share
sell
and
those
who
have
listed
corporations
or
the
way
they’re
reported
in
the
paper,
ones
reported
with
a
purchasing
commission,
the
others
are
reported
without
any
reference
to
purchasing
commissions.
and
that’s
why
–
but
the
only
difference
between
the
two,
that’s
why
this
regulation
around
arouse
such
bitter
opposition
among
the
taxpayers,
their
lawyers
and
accountants
because
it
seemed
to
them
that
the
government
was
merely
sleeping
over
on
them
the
use
of
the
wrong
price
as
quoted
in
the
financial
pages
of
the
paper.
now,
there
was
no
doubt
in
my
mind
that
the
commissioner
was
going
to
lose
this
argument
if
the
question
is,
what’s
the
value
of
the
mutual
fund
share?
and
i
dare
say
that
this
case
wouldn’t
be
before
this
court
today
except
for
one
thing.
the
commissioner
has
a
very
powerful
weapon
to
use
in
such
situations.
it’s
a
regulation.
a
regulation
gives
the
commissioner
an
overwhelming
advantage.
first
of
all,
he
has
the
choice
of
weapons.
he
can
choose
the
court
he
wants
the
case
he
wants
to
try
and
the
court
to
try
it
in.
the
taxpayer
has
none
of
these
choices.
value
becomes
a
secondary
issue.
the
taxpayer
now
has
the
burden
of
proving
that
the
commissioner’s
regulation
is
completely
unreasonable,
arbitrary,
and
capricious.
and
to
top
it
off,
the
commissioner
has
the
presumption,
a
judicial
presumption
that
he
is
right
and
the
taxpayer
is
wrong.
this
isn’t
an
isolated
instance
in
which
the
commissioner
has
used
his
regulations
in
order
to
put
the
taxpayer
to
disadvantage.
he
did
it
with
the
second
class
of
stock
regulations
under
the
--
for
professional
corporations.
his
(inaudible)
regulations
for
professional
corporations.
his
business
expense
regulations
under
section
274
just
to
mention
a
few
that
had
been
struck
down
recently
by
the
lower
courts
and
he
is
even
now
doing
it
with
this
section
42
regulations
on
multiple
corporations
where
again
the
taxpayer
is
going
to
have
a
very
difficult
burden
of
proving
that
a
purely
arbitrary
did
reallocation
of
income
or
expense
is
so
arbitrary
as
to
be
completely
unreasonable.
mr.
ralph
j.
gregg
yes,
sir.
mr.
ralph
j.
gregg
no,
your
honor.
without
subtracting
or
adding
commissions
of
any
kind,
is
the
price
at
which
--
mr.
ralph
j.
gregg
at
a
$100.
oh!
yes.
mr.
ralph
j.
gregg
forget
about
the
commissions
of
the
regulations.
forget
about
them
completely.
they
never
have
included
--
mr.
ralph
j.
gregg
absolutely
correct.
mr.
ralph
j.
gregg
because
they’ve
added
the
purchasing
commission.
and
in
a
normal
transaction
for
list
--
maybe
i
can
express
it,
if
i
don’t
say
it
right
this
time.
let’s
take
the
$5
million
portfolio
of
a
rich
man
on
a
common
stocks.
he
pays
a
tax
on
a
100%
of
what
those
shares
can
be
sold
for
regardless
of
commissions.
here,
the
government
has
ruled
the
small
investor
and
the
mutual
fund
must
pay
a
tax
on
a
108%
of
the
amount
for
which
they
could
be
sold.
this
i
say
is
wrong.
mr.
ralph
j.
gregg
that’s
all
you
can
get
your
honor.
mr.
ralph
j.
gregg
of
practicality,
as
a
matter
of
fact.
mr.
ralph
j.
gregg
that’s
when
you
purchase.
but
what
i
can
get
--
mr.
ralph
j.
gregg
8%
as
a
purchasing
commission
on
small
share
levels.
it
drops
to
4%
then
to
1%
in
the
large
practice.
but
that’s
purchasing.
what
i
can
get
is
only
the
net
asset
value
and
it’s
stipulated
that
the
only
practical
method
of
getting
your
money
is
to
turn
them
into
the
investment
company.
mr.
ralph
j.
gregg
no,
sir.
i
must
have
misspoken
your
honor.
it’s
whether
you
dispose
off
the
stock
or
not
to
put
it
in
trust
is
the
question,
what
are
they
worth
in
the
date
of
death?
the
$5
million
--
of
common
stocks.
they’re
valued
at
a
100%
of
what
they
could
be
sold
for
on
the
market
with
commissions
cutting
always
either
way.
but
here,
the
government
is
saying
that
this
small
investor
in
mutual
funds
must
pay
a
tax
on
108%
of
what
they
can
realize.
mr.
ralph
j.
gregg
small
or
large.
mr.
ralph
j.
gregg
correct.
mr.
ralph
j.
gregg
without
charge.
mr.
ralph
j.
gregg
correct.
mr.
ralph
j.
gregg
you
do.
mr.
ralph
j.
gregg
that’s
the
2%
i
was
talking
about.
mr.
ralph
j.
gregg
you
also
pay
a
2%
commission.
mr.
ralph
j.
gregg
correct.
mr.
ralph
j.
gregg
i
see.
when
a
regulation
has
been
issued
the
taxpayer
job
isn’t
very
easy.
he
has
the
court
to
explore
the
facts
and
decide
the
case
on
its
merits.
the
government’s
position
however,
is
that
the
only
issue
to
be
decided
in
a
vacuum
is
the
validity
of
the
regulation.
and
it
reminds
the
court
that
if
there’s
at
least
some
plausible
grounds
or
rational
basis
for
the
commissioner’s
decision.
it
must
be
sustained.
here
the
government
has
offered
in
its
brief
and
verbally
three
and
assortment
of
gift
tax
cases
as
lending
that
plausibility,
guggenheim
gift
tax
cases,
etcetera.
for
what
connection
is
there
really
between
gifts
to
single
premium
life
insurance
policies
and
life
of
another,
gifts
of
diamond
rings
subject
to
luxury,
wartime
or
excise
taxes.
i
think
that
these
arguments
have
to
be
recognized
for
what
they
really
are.
a
diversionary
tactic
to
persuade
the
court
that
the
commissioner
wasn’t
totally
unreasonable,
then
having
gotten
all
of
the
plausibility
mileage
out
of
these
and
other
equally
far
fetched
analogies
like
blackacre,
etcetera.
i
think,
then
the
government
puts
great
emphasis
i
think
on
the
duty
of
the
court
to
defer
to
the
judgment
of
the
court
defer
to
the
judgment
of
the
commissioner
in
choosing
between
so-called
reasonable
alternatives
citing
united
states
versus
correll
and
bingler
versus
johnson.
but
again,
what
do
those
cases
have
to
do
with
mutual
funds
shares?
and
one
of
the
question
was
when
is
the
businessman
out
of
town,
and
the
other,
what
fellowships
and
scholarships
are
exempt
from
income
tax?
in
both,
there
are
any
numbers
of
definitions,
some
good,
some
better,
one
perhaps
the
best.
and
understandably,
the
court
was
reluctant
to
superimpose
its
judgment
on
that
of
the
taxpayer
and
those
cases.
but
this
isn’t
a
good,
better,
or
best
situation.
it’s
a
good
or
bad.
it’s
reasonable
or
unreasonable
situation.
if
mrs.
bennett
shares
are
worth
$124,000
they
couldn’t
possibly
have
been
worth
the
$133,000.
if
the
$9,000
difference
was
payable
--
if
her
broker
would
get
that,
it
certainly
was
an
asset
of
her
estate.
and
then
as
i
pointed
out
before
with
some
exemptions,
mutual
funds
are
held
by
people
of
matter.
it
means
the
middle
class
investor.
the
rich
man
with
the
portfolio
as
i
said
of
a
million
dollars
worth
of
securities
and
common
stocks
listed
on
the
exchanges.
he
pays
on
the
estate
tax
based
on
the
net
asset
value
of
his
portfolio.
but
the
government
has
ruled
here
that
the
small
investor
must
pay
a
tax
on
a
108%
of
the
net
asset
value
of
his
portfolio.
i
don’t
see
how
the
commissioner
justifies
this
discrimination
and
i
would
surmise
that
that’s
why
the
government
didn’t
ask
congress
for
a
blessing
on
this
new
regulation.
he
might
have
been
reminded
that
congress
in
passing
the
investment
company
act
of
1940
was
recognizing
an
important
public
need
for
a
well
regulated
investment
medium
for
the
small
investor.
and
he
might
have
been
told
that
it
wasn’t
proper
to
penalize
him
for
investing
in
the
open-end
investment
company
shares
that
were
provided
but
that
legislation.
incidentally,
counsel
for
the
investment
company
institute
as
amicus
has
given
the
court
authoritative
intelligent,
informative
brief
as
amicus
explaining
the
close-end
and
open-end
investment
companies,
load
funds,
no
load
funds,
how
the
estate
tax
regulation
ignores
the
realities
of
the
market
place
and
in
addition,
rather
senselessly
discriminates
against
the
holders
of
the
load
fund
shareholders.
our
position
is
that
the
commissioner
in
promulgating
this
regulation
was
completely
unrealistic
and
arbitrary
and
unfair.
by
arbitrarily
assigning
of
value
of
here
to
these
years
which
the
estate
could
never
get
under
any
circumstances
at
a
price
that
precludes
consideration
of
any
other
relevant
facts
which
is
required
by
his
own
regulations.
we
think
that
he
deprives
the
taxpayer’s
due
process
a
lot
and
that’s
why
on
behalf
of
the
many
thousands
of
executors
and
their
attorneys
for
whom
i
happen
but
by
sheer
chance
today
to
be
spokesman.
i
respectfully
urge
this
court
to
agree
with
the
federal
judge
of
my
district
and
the
judges
of
the
second
circuit
court
of
appeals
that
that
value
of
mrs.
bennett
shares
was
a
$124,000
and
that
the
commissioner
was
completely
unrealistic,
unreasonable,
and
arbitrary
in
saying
that
her
estate
should
have
to
pay
a
tax
of
$9,000
next
to
$9,000
that
even
the
government
admits
her
estate
could
never
get
for
them.
mr.
ralph
j.
gregg
i
didn’t.
it’s
the
government
who
takes
that
the
opposite
positions.
they
value
--
the
gm
share
at
100.
they
value
--
mr.
ralph
j.
gregg
i
certainly
am.
mr.
ralph
j.
gregg
if
they
said
you
got
to
value
that
general
motor
share
at
a
hundred
plus
the
2%
purchasing
commission.
in
other
words,
the
replacement
costs
i
would
disagree
with
them
and
they
be
disagreeing
with
their
own
regulations
because
for
time
and
memorial,
they
have
set
the
value
of
a
general
motor
share
is
100
not
a
102.
but
they
say
that
a
value
of
a
mutual
fund
share
is
not
100,
it’s
a
108.
mr.
ralph
j.
gregg
it
so
happens
that
with
ids
there
is
no
selling
commission
or
redemption
charge.
so
that
i
actually
do
in
fact
get
100.
with
the
gm
situation,
i
actually
get
only
98
but
i
agree
that
the
price
at
which
the
shares
change
hands
was
a
100
and
that
that
is
the
fair
market
value
for
estate
tax
purposes.
