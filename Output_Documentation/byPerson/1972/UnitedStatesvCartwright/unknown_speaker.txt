unknown
speaker
mr.
solicitor
general,
prior
to
the
issuance
of
that
regulation
however,
the
department
of
justice
did
not
go
off
--
unknown
speaker
and
the
public
offering
price
is
what
the
company
offers
the
share?
unknown
speaker
but
it
is
never
offered
at
any
other
price?
unknown
speaker
or
by
the
company?
unknown
speaker
oh!
yes.
unknown
speaker
supposing
mr.
solicitor
general,
you
and
i
made
a
deal
for
shares
of
ids
that
i
had.
i
take
it
that
ids
would
accept
their
transfer?
unknown
speaker
to
make
reference
to
the
companion
gift
tax
regulation,
what
does
the
internal
revenue
service
do
in
measuring,
for
instance,
a
gift
of
ids
stock
to
an
unimosounary
(ph)
donee.
do
they
give
the
value
with
the
load
charge
or
without
it?
unknown
speaker
the
difference
however
in
them
is
that
in
the
one
case
it’s
a
seller’s
commission,
in
the
other
case,
it’s
a
buyer’s
commission.
unknown
speaker
mr.
solicitor
general,
in
your
blackacre
example,
one
might
sell
through
an
agent
but
also,
one
might
sell
it
privately,
and
might
realize
the
$100,000.
is
that
true
with
respect
to
a
share
in
a
mutual
fund?
unknown
speaker
mr.
solicitor
general,
is
it
really
accurate
to
say
that
a
fiduciary
of
an
estate
can
find
a
willing
buyer
at
the
public
offering
price?
unknown
speaker
mr.
solicitor
general,
the
regulations
have
always
provided
that
but
it’s
not
without
some
reluctance
on
the
part
of
tax
counsel
to
concede
that
they
are
right
and
--
unknown
speaker
now
that
i’ve
interrupted
you
--
unknown
speaker
well,
let
me
ask
one
thing
which
gives
me
some
perceptual
difficulty.
it
seems
to
me,
there
are
two
sets
of
willing
sellers
and
willing
buyers
here.
there
is,
if
you
will,
the
estate
and
the
fund,
and
there
is
on
the
other
side
of
that
coin
the
fund
and
the
buyer
in
the
market
place.
and
one
could
say
that
the
government’s
position
is
link
in
the
buyer
in
the
one
couple
with
the
seller
and
the
other
in
eliminating
the
fund.
is
this
perceptually
difficulty?
unknown
speaker
are
there
any
other
examples
of
the
revenue
service
valuing
an
asset
at
an
amount
that
the
owner
of
it
can
never
realize
under
any
conditions
whatsoever?
unknown
speaker
under
any
conditions?
unknown
speaker
well,
have
you
said
--
you’d
never
let
him
off
for
that
amount
then
either?
do
you
have
the
load
charge
on
to
that?
unknown
speaker
well,
but
you
don’t
do
that
in
other
context,
do
you?
how
about
an
ordinary
share
of
stock?
unknown
speaker
of
course,
you
haven’t
had
your
automobile
regulation
sustain
either,
do
you?
unknown
speaker
mr.
solicitor
general,
i
am
a
little
bothered
by
the
exchange
between
you
and
mr.
justice
blackmun
earlier
in
just
my
own
analysis
of
the
case.
if
the
commissioner
had
defined
the
valuation
of
mutual
funds
for
across
the
board
purposes,
i
would
find
it
much
easier
to
accept
than
is
definite
--
applying
the
definition
just
to
estate
tax
purposes
and
apparently
living
open
the
question
of
what
a
taxpayer
who
is
giving
mutual
funds
toward
charity,
how
that
will
be
valued.
i
know
you
said
in
answering
to
mr.
justice
blackmun’s
question,
it
was
your
position
that
you
can
value
it
the
same
way.
but
what
was
the
practice
of
the
treasury
at
the
time
that
it
sought
to
assess
this
estate?
unknown
speaker
in
the
meantime
--
[voice
overlap]
whether
they
would
do
the
same
thing
with
respect
to
an
automobile
which
is
given
to
a
hospital?
unknown
speaker
but
suppose
it
were
a
used
car.
would
it
be
the
retail
value?
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
you,
one
more
question.
let’s
take
into
a
common
listed
stock
which
is
traded
over
the
market
within
the
aspects
of
here
today.
as
i
recall,
(inaudible).
unknown
speaker
is
it
consistent?
why
shouldn’t
you
take
the
bid
price?
unknown
speaker
this
is
the
market
totally
unavailable
to
the
estate?
unknown
speaker
this
market
of
which
you
speak.
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
but
this
--
but
the
ids
sale
is
totally
unavailable.
unknown
speaker
yes.
right.
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
the
owner,
the
executor
cannot
sell
that
in
market.
unknown
speaker
and
you
would
say
that
if
your
estate
you
ought
to
have
the
lower
the
price?
unknown
speaker
because
there’s
no
way
you
can
realize
it?
unknown
speaker
if
i
own
a
share
of
general
motors
and
it’s
worth
a
$100
in
the
market
and
i
have
to
pay
a
commission,
i’d
still
get
realize
maybe
98
--
96
but
i
still
have
to
include
it
in
a
100.
unknown
speaker
no,
if
i
own
a
--
unknown
speaker
--
share
of
general
motors
and
i
included
a
$100
even
though
if
i
sold
it,
i
--
and
to
pay
a
commission,
i
might
only
get
96.
unknown
speaker
if
only
i
can
realize
more
than
96
but
it’s
includible
in
my
estate.
is
that
included?
unknown
speaker
and
if
you
sell
merely
to
protect
yourself
against
an
anticipated
dropping
market,
do
you
get
the
administrative
expense
deduction?
unknown
speaker
what
do
you
have
to
say
however
at
the
solicitor
general’s
statement
that
there
are
many
thousands
of
buyers
on
the
date
of
death
who
are
willing
to
pay
net
asset
value
plus
the
load?
unknown
speaker
well,
you’re
using
my
two
sets
of
buyers
and
sellers.
unknown
speaker
mr.
gregg
let
me
bring
you
back
to
justice
white’s
question
about
his
one
share
of
general
motors.
unknown
speaker
is
it
your
position
that
that
should
be
returned
in
the
estate
tax
return
not
at
the
mean
between
the
high
and
the
low
on
the
day
of
death,
but
at
that
the
less
the
broker’s
commission?
unknown
speaker
assuming
you’re
willing
[voice
overlap]
at
a
$100?
unknown
speaker
and
forget
about
the
commissions.
unknown
speaker
even
though
what
the
regulations
do
but
do
you
concede
that
they
are
right
in
that
respect?
unknown
speaker
and
what,
what
--
excuse
me.
why
do
you
say
that
when
you
take
the
position
you
are
as
to
ids
shares?
unknown
speaker
in
the
general
motors
case,
at
least
you
get
the
$100
in
your
pocket
and
you
might
have
expense
but
in
this
case,
you
say
it’s
impossible
for
you
to
ever
realize
under
any
conditions
more
than
the
net
asset
value.
unknown
speaker
mr.
gregg,
when
one
invests
in
mutual
shares,
he
pays
the
8%
you’re
talking
about
at
the
time
he
buys
the
shares.
unknown
speaker
so,
that’s
paying
a
commission
at
the
time
of
purchase.
now,
when
he
sells
those
shares,
they
are
redeemed
in
accordance
with
the
contract
and
he
has
to
pay
no
commission.
unknown
speaker
that’s
right.
unknown
speaker
but
if
you
sell
a
100
shares
of
general
motors,
you
do
pay
a
commission?
unknown
speaker
and
that’s
the
2%
you’ve
been
talking
about?
unknown
speaker
and
if
you
buy
a
share,
100
shares
of
general
motors,
you
also
pay
a
commission.
unknown
speaker
but
in
case
of
mutual
funds,
the
commission
is
paid
only
at
the
time
of
purchase?
unknown
speaker
i
think
there’s
been
some
confusion
as
to
that.
unknown
speaker
mr.
gregg,
i
am
sticky
and
i
am
not
thinking
very
clearly,
tell
me
again
why
you
can
take
a
position
one
way
with
gm
and
the
position
another
way
with
ids?
unknown
speaker
but
you
were
willing
to
put
it
in
at
a
hundred?
unknown
speaker
but
not
at
a
--
unknown
speaker
well,
looking
at
it
from
the
other
side
of
that
same
coin,
you’re
arguing
the
ids
situation
as
what
the
estate
can
realize

not
the

at
what
you
can
realize.
