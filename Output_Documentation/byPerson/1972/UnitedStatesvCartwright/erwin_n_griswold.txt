mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
a
federal
estate
tax
case.
this
is
here
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
review
a
decision
of
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit.
it
involves
one
of
those
narrow
but
recurring
questions
which
have
no
place
to
come
for
final
decision
except
here
and
which
arrive
here
only
after
long
continued
litigation
and
multiple
decisions
in
the
lower
courts.
the
question
relates
to
the
value
to
be
assigned
to
mutual
fund
shares
held
by
the
estate
of
a
decedent.
specifically,
it
involves
the
validity
of
section
20.1031-8
(b)
of
the
treasury
regulations
on
estate
tax
which
is
printed
at
pages
25
and
26
of
our
brief.
beginning
at
the
bottom
of
page
25
it
provides,
“the
fair
market
value
of
a
share
in
an
open-end
investment
company
(commonly
known
as
a
mutual
fund)
is
the
public
offering
price
of
a
share.”
then
there
is
a
final
clause
which
is
not
relevant,
“adjusted
for
any
reduction
in
price
available
to
the
public
in
acquiring
the
number
of
shares
being
valued.”
but
the
significant
part
is
that
the
regulation
provides
that,
“the
fair
market
value
of
a
share
in
an
open-end
investment
company
is
the
public
offering
price
of
a
share.”
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
prior
to
the
issuance
of
that
regulation,
there
was
confusion
and
uncertainty.
there
was
no
clear
rule
or
practice.
the
treasury
repeatedly
endeavored
to
use
the
public
offering
price.
very
frequently,
the
matter
was
settled
out
as
one
of
the
numerous
things
which
came
up
in
the
final
adjustment
with
the
revenue
agent.
when
suits
were
brought,
the
department
of
justice
would
not
defend
the
public
offering
price
as
the
value
in
the
state
of
the
law
where
there
was
no
regulation
and
no
officially
stated
rule.
and
i
dare
i
say
that
that
is
one
of
the
reasons
why
this
regulation
upon
which
we
rely
here,
which
was
issued
on
october
10,
1963
by
final
approval
by
the
commissioner
of
internal
revenue
and
the
assistant
secretary
of
the
treasury,
and
publication
in
the
federal
register
as
a
treasury
decision
while
it
provides
at
the
bottom
of
page
26
in
our
brief,
the
provisions
of
this
paragraph
shall
apply
with
respect
to
estates
of
decedents
dying
after
october
10,
1963.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
the
public
offering
price
is
the
price
at
which
the
distributor
sells
the
shares.
it
is
the
price
which
is
stated
in
a
prospectus.
usually,
there
is
a
close
arrangement
between
the
distributor
and
the
investment
company
itself.
the
investment
company
receives
the
net
asset
value.
the
distributor
receives
the
addition
which
in
this
case
is
usually
about
8%
often
referred
to
as
the
load.
and
a
way
to
look
at
it
and
one
to
which
i
shall
return
is
that
the
public
offering
price
is
the
retail
price
at
which
the
shares
are
sold
to
the
public.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
they
not
only
are
never
offered
at
any
other
price
by
the
distributor
but
the
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
or
by
the
company.
they
could
be
offered
by
you
or
me
if
we
own
them
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
--
at
another
price.
but
the
industry
has
a
built-in
resale
price
maintenance
provision
in
the
law
from
the
beginning
section
22
of
the
investment
company
act
provides
that
no
principal
underwriter
of
such
security
and
no
dealer
which
means
anybody
who
is
a
dealer
shall
sell
any
such
security
to
any
person
except
the
dealer,
a
principal
underwriter
or
the
issuer
except
at
a
current
public
offering
price
described
in
the
prospectus.
so
that
the
public
offering
price
is
the
only
lawful
price
at
which
it
may
be
sold
by
a
person
who
is
subject
to
the
investment
company
act
which
means
an
underwriter
or
a
dealer.
in
this
case,
that
is
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes,
mr.
justice
i
understand
they
not
only
would
but
that
they
must,
and
apparently,
there
are
very
rare
sales
by
one
individual
to
another.
they
are
discouraged
by
the
industry
as
much
as
possible
and
they
are
impossible
through
dealers
because
a
dealer
cannot
sell
except
at
a
public
offering
price.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
not
necessarily.
they
might
be
sold
between
members
of
the
family
or
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
--
or
to
its
friends
or
in
some
special
circumstance.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
there
would
be
a
substantial
amount
involved
in
a
big
block
and
a
person
who
had
a
large
block
would
be
reluctant
to
have
them
redeemed
at
the
net
asset
value
if
he
could
find
some
other
way
to
do
it.
apparently,
it
is
still
very
difficult
to
sell
them
by
a
private
individual
at
anything
approaching
the
public
offering
price.
in
this
case,
the
decedent
died
on
december
4,
1964,
somewhat
more
than
a
year
after
the
new
regulation
was
put
out
so
that
the
regulation
was
applicable.
her
executor
valued
the
shares
on
her
estate
tax
return
at
the
redemption
price,
the
bid
price,
or
net
asset
value.
the
commissioner
determined
in
accordance
with
the
regulations
that
the
share
should
be
valued
at
their
public
offering
price
and
he
determined
that
a
deficiency
accordingly.
that
difference
is
the
load
usually
about
8%
in
an
open-end
investment
trust.
the
executor
paid
the
additional
tax,
filed
a
claim
for
refund,
filed
suit
to
recover
the
tax
contending
that
the
regulation
is
invalid,
and
the
district
court
agreed
and
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed.
the
regulation
has
similarly
been
held
invalid
in
the
ninth
circuit
in
davis
against
the
united
states
with
one
dissent.
that
case
involved
$600
and
we
did
not
seek
to
bring
it
here
because
the
question
is
here
in
this
case.
on
the
other
hand,
the
regulation
has
been
upheld
in
the
sixth
circuit
in
ruehlmann
against
the
commissioner
which
affirmed
a
divided
decision
of
the
tax
court
of
united
states
and
this
court
denied
certiorari
several
years
ago.
and
the
companion
gift
tax
regulation
has
been
held
valid
by
the
seventh
circuit
in
halliwell
against
the
united
states,
and
similarly
there’s
been
some
division
in
the
decisions
of
the
district
courts
and
the
question
is
now
pending
before
the
tenth
circuit
and
the
court
of
claims.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
it
is
my
position
mr.
justice
that
in
determining
the
value
of
a
gift
of
a
mutual
fund
share
to
a
charity
that
under
the
analogy
to
the
regulation
because
the
regulation
applies
directly
to
estate
tax
and
to
gift
tax
that
the
amount
of
the
deduction
is
the
public
offering
price
exactly
the
same
figure
for
which
we
contend
here.
i
believe
our
opponents
say
that
there
is
no
evidence
that
that
is
actually
applied.
i
cannot
cite
clear
authorities
but
it
is
our
position
that
that
is
the
valuation
which
should
be
applied
in
determining
the
amount
of
a
gift
tax
deduction.
now
at
first
flash,
it
may
seem
that
the
regulation
goes
a
little
far.
it’s
contended
vigorously
that
the
most
that
the
estate
can
realize
from
the
shares
is
the
bid
price
or
what
might
be
called
a
liquidating
value.
but
further
consideration,
i
think
shows
that
that
argument
is
by
no
means
conclusive.
a
property
is
not
ordinarily
valued
in
estates
at
what
can
be
realized
from
it.
for
example,
if
the
decedent
owned
blackacre
at
an
agreed
valued
of
a
$100,000.
his
estate
could
not
ordinarily
realize
a
$100,000
from
it.
it
would
be
likely
to
have
to
pay
a
commission
on
sale
of
say
$6,000
or
6%.
yet
the
value
of
blackacre
for
estate
tax
purposes
would
undoubtedly
be
a
$100,000
and
not
the
$94,000
that
could
be
realized
net
on
its
sale.
and
that
i
think
on
further
reflection
is
right,
if
they
continue
the
whole
blackacre,
don’t
sell
it,
it’s
worth
a
$100,000.
on
the
other
hand,
if
they
sell
back
blackacre,
and
have
to
pay
a
$6,000
commission
on
sale.
that
commission
is
deductible
and
only
the
net
amount
would
be
subject
to
estate
tax.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes,
mr.
justice
but
i
don’t
think
that
really
makes
any
difference
because
i
think
that’s
really
the
difference
between
a
sale
on
the
market
and
a
retail
sale.
when
you
sell
real
estate,
you
sell
it
on
a
market,
and
similarly,
with
respect
to
ordinary
stocks
and
bonds
held
by
a
decedent’s
estate.
the
value
for
estate
tax
purposes
would
not
be
reduced
by
a
commission
on
sale
even
though
such
a
commission
would
reduce
the
amount
which
could
actually
be
realized
on
the
sale
of
the
shares.
now,
in
this
case,
the
load
becomes
a
part
of
the
retail
price
just
as
the
retailers’
markup
in
a
drugstore
or
a
grocery
store
becomes
a
part
of
the
retail
price
including
a
portion
of
the
markup
which
he
devotes
to
a
commission
to
his
sales
people,
and
yet
the
retail
price
would
be
the
fair
market
value
of
the
property
and
would
include
the
sales
commission.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
it
is
true
if
you
can
find
a
buyer
who
will
pay
you
the
full
price.
experience
and
the
record
show
that
that
is
a
rare
occurrence
or
it
does
sometimes
occur.
the
problem
of
disposing
off
the
shares,
suppose
you
do
dispose
off
them
at
the
net
asset
value
then
you
can
deduct
the
amount
of
the
difference
between
the
public
offering
price
and
the
net
asset
value
as
in
administration
expense,
if
you
sell
them
in
connection
with
the
administration
of
the
estate,
so
that
you
would
only
be
taxed
if
you
actually
do
sell
them
on
the
net
figure.
on
the
other
hand,
if
you
don’t
sell
them,
you
have
got
something
which
costs
the
full
amount
in
the
only
place
where
you
can
legally
buy
them
and
practically
buy
them.
the
offering
price
is
in
fact
the
price
at
which
large
numbers
of
these
shares
change
hand
everyday
from
willing
sellers
to
willing
buyers.
thus,
the
record
in
this
case
includes
exhibit
11
offered
by
the
taxpayer
which
shows
the
numbers
of
shares
sold
for
a
number
of
different
fiscal
years
for
each
one
of
these
three
funds.
exhibit
11
shows
that
in
the
fiscal
year
ended
october
31st,
1965
which
is
the
year
in
which
the
decedent
died;
investors
stock
funds
sold
15,213,000
shares
which
works
out
to
about
$60,000
per
day
--
about
60,000
shares
per
day.
investors
mutual
sold
34,
499,000
shares
in
the
year-ended
september
30th,
1965,
that
works
out
to
about
a
138,000
shares
per
day
which
shows
that
there
were
a
very
large
number
of
willing
buyers
who
were
willing
to
pay
the
net
offering
price
at
retail
to
sellers
who
were
ready,
willing,
and
available
to
sell
the
shares
at
the
public
offering
price.
now,
the
third
fund,
investors
selective
fund
was
considerably
smaller.
it
sold
1,500,000
shares
during
the
applicable
fiscal
year
but
even
that
would
work
out
to
6,000
shares
per
day
which
passed
from
willing
sellers
to
willing
buyers.
now,
this
is
very
persuasive
evidence
it
seems
to
me
that
the
offering
price
is
in
fact
the
price
at
which
these
shares
really
transfer
from
a
willing
seller
to
willing
buyer
or
at
least
that
the
regulation
which
provides
that
they
should
be
valued
on
this
basis
prospectively
applied
is
a
proper
one
for
the
commissioner
of
internal
revenue
to
make
and
should
be
sustained
by
this
court.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no,
mr.
justice
but
i
don’t
think
that’s
necessary.
perhaps,
this
is
as
good
a
point
as
any
to
bring
in
this
court’s
decision
in
guggenheim
against
rasquin
which
involved
a
gift,
a
gift
of
a
paid
up
life
insurance
policy.
and
the
contention
was
there
made
on
behalf
of
the
taxpayer
that
the
gift
should
be
valued
at
the
surrender
value
of
the
life
insurance
policy
which
is
the
only
amount
which
the
donee
could
obtain
either
from
the
insurance
company
or
from
a
bank
if
it
wanted
to
borrow
on
the
policy.
and
this
court
held
in
guggenheim
against
rasquin
that
the
proper
value
for
gift
tax
purposes
was
the
cost
of
that
policy.
this
was
the
price
which
would
have
to
be
paid
in
order
to
obtain
such
a
policy.
this
is
in
effect
not
the
liquidating
value
which
the
surrender
value
would
be
but
the
retail
price
of
the
policy,
and
it
used
as
analogy
a
gift
by
a
man
to
his
wife
of
a
new
automobile.
let’s
say
that
the
automobile
was
a
cadillac
which
costs
$65,000
for
he
paid
$65,000.
he
drove
it
to
the
house
in
order
to
deliver
it
to
his
wife
as
a
gift.
by
that
time,
it
was
a
used
car
and
it
could
be
turned
into
a
dealer
only
for
a
sum
considerably
less
than
$65,000.
but
the
regulations
have
always
provided
that
the
value
in
such
a
case
is
the
retail
price,
the
price
which
would
have
to
be
paid
for
such
an
item.
and
now
let
me
take
for
example
these
very
mutual
funds
here.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
don’t
think
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
--
mr.
justice,
there’s
been
much
reluctance
since
guggenheim
and
rasquin
which
is
30
years
ago.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
well,
mr.
justice
there
are
difficulties
here
of
course.
nevertheless,
to
me,
the
really
controlling
factor
in
determining
whether
the
regulation
made
by
the
treasury
can
be
sustained
or
not.
after
all,
this
court
doesn’t
have
to
decide
whether
it’s
right.
this
court
need
only
decide
that
it
was
proper
for
the
treasury
to
make
this
regulation.
and
the
fact
is
that
very
large
numbers
of
these
shares
are
transferred
everyday
between
willing
sellers
and
willing
buyers
at
the
net
asset
price.
now,
it
is
said
in
the
guggenheim
case
that,
oh,
well
the
insurance
policy
had
a
lot
of
value
above
and
beyond
the
surrender
value
and
it’s
proper
to
take
that
into
account
in
determining
the
value
of
the
insurance
policy.
but
same
thing
is
equally
applicable
here.
mutual
fund
shares
are
widely
sold
on
the
representation
which
has
great
substance
but
this
is
the
only
way
that
a
small
investor
can
get
diversification.
they
are
also
sold
on
the
representation
which
may
or
may
not
work
out
an
experience
but
presumably
has
some
effect
to
it
and
at
least
for
which
people
are
wiling
to
pay
that
through
the
mutual
fund,
you
can
get
expert
management.
you
can
get
before
your
relatively
small
investment
the
same
kind
of
supervision
and
watching
and
care
and
foresight
that
a
very
large
investor
can
have.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
well,
yes
mr.
justice.
guggenheim
and
rasquin,
and
the
life
insurance
policy
is
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
under
any
conditions
the
--
well,
i
don’t
know
what
to
say.
just
as
much
as
here
because
the
share
may
be
valued
at
its
net
asset
value
on
the
decedent’s
death
at
$10,000,
let
us
say,
although,
he
can
only
realize
9,200
by
turning
it
in.
but
by
the
time,
he
does
turn
it
in,
the
market
has
gone
way
up
and
he
gets
$11,000
for
it.
there’s
no
impossibility
of
his
obtaining
the
full
amount
of
the
value
which
is
determined
at
the
date
of
the
decedent’s
death.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no,
i
don’t
think
you
would
add
any
load
charge
on
to
that.
if
he’s
later
sold
the
shares
for
$10,000
--
for
$11,000,
he
would
have
a
gain
of
$1,000
and
of
only
$1,000
although
he
had
in
fact
realized
1,800
more
than
he
could
have
realized
on
the
date
of
death.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
if
the
item
is
sold
on
the
market,
then
you
do
not
take
into
account
either
buying
or
selling
commission.
on
the
other
hand,
if
the
item
is
sold
at
retail,
and
let’s
take
jewelry,
i’ve
already
referred
to
an
automobile.
if
the
item
is
sold
at
retail,
it
is
customarily
and
always
has
been
valued
at
its
retail
price.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no,
mr.
justice.
the
automobile
regulation
goes
back
a
great
many
years,
and
guggenheim-rasquin
goes
back
31
years
now.
but
this
regulation,
not
only
is
12
years
old,
but
it
was
officially
promulgated
more
than
a
year
before
this
decedent
died
and
it
is
in
our
contention
a
permissible
approach
by
the
treasury
to
take
to
this
problem.
as
this
court
has
twice
said
recently
in
correll
and
in
bingler.
alternatives
are
of
course
available.
improvements
might
be
imagined
but
we
do
not
sit
as
a
committee
of
revision
to
perfect
the
administration
of
the
tax
laws.
congress
has
delegated
to
the
commissioner
not
to
the
courts
the
task
of
prescribing
all
needful
rules.
in
this
area
of
limitless
factual
variations,
it
is
the
province
of
congress
and
the
commissioner
not
the
courts
to
make
the
appropriate
adjustment.
the
role
of
the
judiciary
in
cases
of
this
sort
begins
and
ends
with
assuring
that
the
commissioner’s
regulations
fall
within
his
authority
to
implement
the
congressional
mandate
in
some
reasonable
manner.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
correll
is
in
389
u.s.

this
potation
appears
and
the
citations
appears
on
page
9
of
our
brief.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
mr.
justice,
the
regulation
is
not
limited
to
estate
tax.
it
also
applies
expressly
to
the
gift
tax
and
was
issued
on
the
same
day
on
the
same
treasury
decision
with
respect
to
the
gift
tax.
with
respect
to
the
income
tax,
i
know
of
nothing
which
makes
clear
any
practice.
in
this
respect,
it
is
my
position
and
the
position
which
i
would
advise
the
treasury
to
follow
that
they
should
treat
the
net
asset
the
public
offering
price
as
the
value
for
gift
tax
purposes
for
determining
the
amount
of
the
gift
in
a
deduction
under
the
income
tax.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes,
mr.
justice.
if
they
gave
a
brand
new
automobile,
i
would
think
they
would
be
entitled
to
the
--
let's
say
an
ambulance,
i
think
they
would
be
entitled
to
deduct
the
cost
of
that
automobile
as
a
gift
to
the
hospital.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
if
it
were
a
used
car,
i
think
it
would
be
the
price
which
they
properly
paid
to
a
dealer
in
used
cars.
in
other
words,
the
retail
price
for
a
used
car.
but
let
me
take
--
let
me
take
an
instance
which
seems
to
me
to
be
very
close.
let’s
just
take
a
gift
of
mutual
fund
shares.
suppose
a
man
gives
his
daughter,
$10,000
worth
of
mutual
fund
shares
as
a
christmas
gifts.
he
would
suppose
i
think
that
he
has
made
a
$10,000
gift
and
that
he
should
make
a
corresponding
report
on
a
gift
tax
return.
and
that
is
precisely
what
the
regulation
prescribed.
this
is
on
page
27
of
our
brief.
we
have
set
out
the
gift
tax
return,
likewise,
applicable
with
respect
to
gifts
made
after
october
10,
1963.
now
that
seems
clearly
the
right
value
for
gift
tax
purposes
of
mutual
fund
shares.
and
yet,
there’s
no
basis
for
distinguishing
the
value
for
gift
tax
purposes
and
the
value
for
estate
tax
purposes.
if
the
bid
price
determines
the
value
for
estate
tax
purposes,
then
it
is
hard
to
see
why
the
bid
price
should
not
control
the
value
under
the
gift
tax.
on
this
basis,
the
father
would
have
made
a
gift
of
$9,200
and
not
$10,000.
that
is
his
gift
would
be
valued
at
the
net
asset
value
after
excluding
the
load
and
not
at
the
offering
price
which
was
in
fact
the
price
at
which
the
willing
father
purchased
the
shares
from
a
willing
seller
and
to
me
the
controlling
concept
here
at
least
in
determining
whether
the
treasury
had
a
rational
basis
for
its
conclusion
is
the
retail
price.
the
retail
price
of
these
shares
is
the
public
offering
price
not
the
net
asset.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
that
is
an
administration
expense
which
is
deductible.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
deductible
in
computing
the
net
estate
for
estate
tax
purposes.
not
the
income
of
the
estate.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
but
in
computing
the
united
states
for
estate
tax
purposes.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes,
mr.
justice.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
don’t
think
so
mr.
justice
because
i
think
that
that
really
highlights
the
very
point
i
am
trying
to
make
that
the
difference
between
the
sale
on
the
market
in
which
case
neither
selling
nor
buying
commissions
are
taken
into
account
whether
they
are
paid
or
not.
and
in
the
case
of
an
over-the-counter
share,
if
it’s
sold
on
that
day,
then
that
determines
the
market
price.
if
it
didn’t
sell
on
that
day,
then
you
take
the
mean
between
the
bid
and
the
asked
because
that’s
the
closest
you
can
come.
although,
if
it’s
sold
on
the
day
before
or
the
day
after
that
is
also
sometimes
given
some
weight
in
determining
the
value.
on
the
other
hand
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
what
is
totally
unavailable?
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no,
not
--
you
talked
about
the
over-the-counter
securities.
i’m
talking
about
things
which
are
sold
on
a
market
which
would
include
over-the-counter
securities.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
they
are
sold
on
a
market.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
the
ids
sale
is
not
on
the
market.
it
is
at
retail.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
and
that
to
me
is
the
whole
key
to
this
problem.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
a
person
who
buys
at
retail
ordinarily
cannot
resale
because
he
is
not
a
retailer.
he
is
a
consumer.
if
he
wants
to
dispose
of
whatever
he
buys
whether
it’s
a
fur
coat
or
an
automobile
or
something
else.
she
has
to
find
somebody
who
will
give
him
something
which
will
be
less
than
the
amount
he
paid
for.
nevertheless,
if
the
item
is
a
thing
which
is
customarily
sold
at
retail,
i
think
that
the
value
for
estate
and
gift
tax
purposes
should
be
the
retail
price
but
that
is
in
effect
what
this
court
decided
in
guggenheim
against
rasquin,
that
that
is
the
foundation
for
the
regulation
in
this
case.
that
the
regulation
though
it
may
not
be
inevitable
and
i
do
not
contend
that
it
is,
is
a
rational
regulation
and
that
it
should
be
sustained
by
this
court.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
a
federal
estate
tax
case.
this
is
here
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
review
a
decision
of
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit.
it
involves
one
of
those
narrow
but
recurring
questions
which
have
no
place
to
come
for
final
decision
except
here
and
which
arrive
here
only
after
long
continued
litigation
and
multiple
decisions
in
the
lower
courts.
the
question
relates
to
the
value
to
be
assigned
to
mutual
fund
shares
held
by
the
estate
of
a
decedent.
specifically,
it
involves
the
validity
of
section
20.1031-8
(b)
of
the
treasury
regulations
on
estate
tax
which
is
printed
at
pages
25
and
26
of
our
brief.
beginning
at
the
bottom
of
page
25
it
provides,
“the
fair
market
value
of
a
share
in
an
open-end
investment
company
(commonly
known
as
a
mutual
fund)
is
the
public
offering
price
of
a
share.”
then
there
is
a
final
clause
which
is
not
relevant,
“adjusted
for
any
reduction
in
price
available
to
the
public
in
acquiring
the
number
of
shares
being
valued.”
but
the
significant
part
is
that
the
regulation
provides
that,
“the
fair
market
value
of
a
share
in
an
open-end
investment
company
is
the
public
offering
price
of
a
share.”
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
prior
to
the
issuance
of
that
regulation,
there
was
confusion
and
uncertainty.
there
was
no
clear
rule
or
practice.
the
treasury
repeatedly
endeavored
to
use
the
public
offering
price.
very
frequently,
the
matter
was
settled
out
as
one
of
the
numerous
things
which
came
up
in
the
final
adjustment
with
the
revenue
agent.
when
suits
were
brought,
the
department
of
justice
would
not
defend
the
public
offering
price
as
the
value
in
the
state
of
the
law
where
there
was
no
regulation
and
no
officially
stated
rule.
and
i
dare
i
say
that
that
is
one
of
the
reasons
why
this
regulation
upon
which
we
rely
here,
which
was
issued
on
october
10,
1963
by
final
approval
by
the
commissioner
of
internal
revenue
and
the
assistant
secretary
of
the
treasury,
and
publication
in
the
federal
register
as
a
treasury
decision
while
it
provides
at
the
bottom
of
page
26
in
our
brief,
the
provisions
of
this
paragraph
shall
apply
with
respect
to
estates
of
decedents
dying
after
october
10,
1963.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
the
public
offering
price
is
the
price
at
which
the
distributor
sells
the
shares.
it
is
the
price
which
is
stated
in
a
prospectus.
usually,
there
is
a
close
arrangement
between
the
distributor
and
the
investment
company
itself.
the
investment
company
receives
the
net
asset
value.
the
distributor
receives
the
addition
which
in
this
case
is
usually
about
8%
often
referred
to
as
the
load.
and
a
way
to
look
at
it
and
one
to
which
i
shall
return
is
that
the
public
offering
price
is
the
retail
price
at
which
the
shares
are
sold
to
the
public.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
they
not
only
are
never
offered
at
any
other
price
by
the
distributor
but
the
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
or
by
the
company.
they
could
be
offered
by
you
or
me
if
we
own
them
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
--
at
another
price.
but
the
industry
has
a
built-in
resale
price
maintenance
provision
in
the
law
from
the
beginning
section
22
of
the
investment
company
act
provides
that
no
principal
underwriter
of
such
security
and
no
dealer
which
means
anybody
who
is
a
dealer
shall
sell
any
such
security
to
any
person
except
the
dealer,
a
principal
underwriter
or
the
issuer
except
at
a
current
public
offering
price
described
in
the
prospectus.
so
that
the
public
offering
price
is
the
only
lawful
price
at
which
it
may
be
sold
by
a
person
who
is
subject
to
the
investment
company
act
which
means
an
underwriter
or
a
dealer.
in
this
case,
that
is
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes,
mr.
justice
i
understand
they
not
only
would
but
that
they
must,
and
apparently,
there
are
very
rare
sales
by
one
individual
to
another.
they
are
discouraged
by
the
industry
as
much
as
possible
and
they
are
impossible
through
dealers
because
a
dealer
cannot
sell
except
at
a
public
offering
price.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
not
necessarily.
they
might
be
sold
between
members
of
the
family
or
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
--
or
to
its
friends
or
in
some
special
circumstance.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
there
would
be
a
substantial
amount
involved
in
a
big
block
and
a
person
who
had
a
large
block
would
be
reluctant
to
have
them
redeemed
at
the
net
asset
value
if
he
could
find
some
other
way
to
do
it.
apparently,
it
is
still
very
difficult
to
sell
them
by
a
private
individual
at
anything
approaching
the
public
offering
price.
in
this
case,
the
decedent
died
on
december
4,
1964,
somewhat
more
than
a
year
after
the
new
regulation
was
put
out
so
that
the
regulation
was
applicable.
her
executor
valued
the
shares
on
her
estate
tax
return
at
the
redemption
price,
the
bid
price,
or
net
asset
value.
the
commissioner
determined
in
accordance
with
the
regulations
that
the
share
should
be
valued
at
their
public
offering
price
and
he
determined
that
a
deficiency
accordingly.
that
difference
is
the
load
usually
about
8%
in
an
open-end
investment
trust.
the
executor
paid
the
additional
tax,
filed
a
claim
for
refund,
filed
suit
to
recover
the
tax
contending
that
the
regulation
is
invalid,
and
the
district
court
agreed
and
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed.
the
regulation
has
similarly
been
held
invalid
in
the
ninth
circuit
in
davis
against
the
united
states
with
one
dissent.
that
case
involved
$600
and
we
did
not
seek
to
bring
it
here
because
the
question
is
here
in
this
case.
on
the
other
hand,
the
regulation
has
been
upheld
in
the
sixth
circuit
in
ruehlmann
against
the
commissioner
which
affirmed
a
divided
decision
of
the
tax
court
of
united
states
and
this
court
denied
certiorari
several
years
ago.
and
the
companion
gift
tax
regulation
has
been
held
valid
by
the
seventh
circuit
in
halliwell
against
the
united
states,
and
similarly
there’s
been
some
division
in
the
decisions
of
the
district
courts
and
the
question
is
now
pending
before
the
tenth
circuit
and
the
court
of
claims.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
it
is
my
position
mr.
justice
that
in
determining
the
value
of
a
gift
of
a
mutual
fund
share
to
a
charity
that
under
the
analogy
to
the
regulation
because
the
regulation
applies
directly
to
estate
tax
and
to
gift
tax
that
the
amount
of
the
deduction
is
the
public
offering
price
exactly
the
same
figure
for
which
we
contend
here.
i
believe
our
opponents
say
that
there
is
no
evidence
that
that
is
actually
applied.
i
cannot
cite
clear
authorities
but
it
is
our
position
that
that
is
the
valuation
which
should
be
applied
in
determining
the
amount
of
a
gift
tax
deduction.
now
at
first
flash,
it
may
seem
that
the
regulation
goes
a
little
far.
it’s
contended
vigorously
that
the
most
that
the
estate
can
realize
from
the
shares
is
the
bid
price
or
what
might
be
called
a
liquidating
value.
but
further
consideration,
i
think
shows
that
that
argument
is
by
no
means
conclusive.
a
property
is
not
ordinarily
valued
in
estates
at
what
can
be
realized
from
it.
for
example,
if
the
decedent
owned
blackacre
at
an
agreed
valued
of
a
$100,000.
his
estate
could
not
ordinarily
realize
a
$100,000
from
it.
it
would
be
likely
to
have
to
pay
a
commission
on
sale
of
say
$6,000
or
6%.
yet
the
value
of
blackacre
for
estate
tax
purposes
would
undoubtedly
be
a
$100,000
and
not
the
$94,000
that
could
be
realized
net
on
its
sale.
and
that
i
think
on
further
reflection
is
right,
if
they
continue
the
whole
blackacre,
don’t
sell
it,
it’s
worth
a
$100,000.
on
the
other
hand,
if
they
sell
back
blackacre,
and
have
to
pay
a
$6,000
commission
on
sale.
that
commission
is
deductible
and
only
the
net
amount
would
be
subject
to
estate
tax.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes,
mr.
justice
but
i
don’t
think
that
really
makes
any
difference
because
i
think
that’s
really
the
difference
between
a
sale
on
the
market
and
a
retail
sale.
when
you
sell
real
estate,
you
sell
it
on
a
market,
and
similarly,
with
respect
to
ordinary
stocks
and
bonds
held
by
a
decedent’s
estate.
the
value
for
estate
tax
purposes
would
not
be
reduced
by
a
commission
on
sale
even
though
such
a
commission
would
reduce
the
amount
which
could
actually
be
realized
on
the
sale
of
the
shares.
now,
in
this
case,
the
load
becomes
a
part
of
the
retail
price
just
as
the
retailers’
markup
in
a
drugstore
or
a
grocery
store
becomes
a
part
of
the
retail
price
including
a
portion
of
the
markup
which
he
devotes
to
a
commission
to
his
sales
people,
and
yet
the
retail
price
would
be
the
fair
market
value
of
the
property
and
would
include
the
sales
commission.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
it
is
true
if
you
can
find
a
buyer
who
will
pay
you
the
full
price.
experience
and
the
record
show
that
that
is
a
rare
occurrence
or
it
does
sometimes
occur.
the
problem
of
disposing
off
the
shares,
suppose
you
do
dispose
off
them
at
the
net
asset
value
then
you
can
deduct
the
amount
of
the
difference
between
the
public
offering
price
and
the
net
asset
value
as
in
administration
expense,
if
you
sell
them
in
connection
with
the
administration
of
the
estate,
so
that
you
would
only
be
taxed
if
you
actually
do
sell
them
on
the
net
figure.
on
the
other
hand,
if
you
don’t
sell
them,
you
have
got
something
which
costs
the
full
amount
in
the
only
place
where
you
can
legally
buy
them
and
practically
buy
them.
the
offering
price
is
in
fact
the
price
at
which
large
numbers
of
these
shares
change
hand
everyday
from
willing
sellers
to
willing
buyers.
thus,
the
record
in
this
case
includes
exhibit
11
offered
by
the
taxpayer
which
shows
the
numbers
of
shares
sold
for
a
number
of
different
fiscal
years
for
each
one
of
these
three
funds.
exhibit
11
shows
that
in
the
fiscal
year
ended
october
31st,
1965
which
is
the
year
in
which
the
decedent
died;
investors
stock
funds
sold
15,213,000
shares
which
works
out
to
about
$60,000
per
day
--
about
60,000
shares
per
day.
investors
mutual
sold
34,
499,000
shares
in
the
year-ended
september
30th,
1965,
that
works
out
to
about
a
138,000
shares
per
day
which
shows
that
there
were
a
very
large
number
of
willing
buyers
who
were
willing
to
pay
the
net
offering
price
at
retail
to
sellers
who
were
ready,
willing,
and
available
to
sell
the
shares
at
the
public
offering
price.
now,
the
third
fund,
investors
selective
fund
was
considerably
smaller.
it
sold
1,500,000
shares
during
the
applicable
fiscal
year
but
even
that
would
work
out
to
6,000
shares
per
day
which
passed
from
willing
sellers
to
willing
buyers.
now,
this
is
very
persuasive
evidence
it
seems
to
me
that
the
offering
price
is
in
fact
the
price
at
which
these
shares
really
transfer
from
a
willing
seller
to
willing
buyer
or
at
least
that
the
regulation
which
provides
that
they
should
be
valued
on
this
basis
prospectively
applied
is
a
proper
one
for
the
commissioner
of
internal
revenue
to
make
and
should
be
sustained
by
this
court.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no,
mr.
justice
but
i
don’t
think
that’s
necessary.
perhaps,
this
is
as
good
a
point
as
any
to
bring
in
this
court’s
decision
in
guggenheim
against
rasquin
which
involved
a
gift,
a
gift
of
a
paid
up
life
insurance
policy.
and
the
contention
was
there
made
on
behalf
of
the
taxpayer
that
the
gift
should
be
valued
at
the
surrender
value
of
the
life
insurance
policy
which
is
the
only
amount
which
the
donee
could
obtain
either
from
the
insurance
company
or
from
a
bank
if
it
wanted
to
borrow
on
the
policy.
and
this
court
held
in
guggenheim
against
rasquin
that
the
proper
value
for
gift
tax
purposes
was
the
cost
of
that
policy.
this
was
the
price
which
would
have
to
be
paid
in
order
to
obtain
such
a
policy.
this
is
in
effect
not
the
liquidating
value
which
the
surrender
value
would
be
but
the
retail
price
of
the
policy,
and
it
used
as
analogy
a
gift
by
a
man
to
his
wife
of
a
new
automobile.
let’s
say
that
the
automobile
was
a
cadillac
which
costs
$65,000
for
he
paid
$65,000.
he
drove
it
to
the
house
in
order
to
deliver
it
to
his
wife
as
a
gift.
by
that
time,
it
was
a
used
car
and
it
could
be
turned
into
a
dealer
only
for
a
sum
considerably
less
than
$65,000.
but
the
regulations
have
always
provided
that
the
value
in
such
a
case
is
the
retail
price,
the
price
which
would
have
to
be
paid
for
such
an
item.
and
now
let
me
take
for
example
these
very
mutual
funds
here.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
don’t
think
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
--
mr.
justice,
there’s
been
much
reluctance
since
guggenheim
and
rasquin
which
is
30
years
ago.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
well,
mr.
justice
there
are
difficulties
here
of
course.
nevertheless,
to
me,
the
really
controlling
factor
in
determining
whether
the
regulation
made
by
the
treasury
can
be
sustained
or
not.
after
all,
this
court
doesn’t
have
to
decide
whether
it’s
right.
this
court
need
only
decide
that
it
was
proper
for
the
treasury
to
make
this
regulation.
and
the
fact
is
that
very
large
numbers
of
these
shares
are
transferred
everyday
between
willing
sellers
and
willing
buyers
at
the
net
asset
price.
now,
it
is
said
in
the
guggenheim
case
that,
oh,
well
the
insurance
policy
had
a
lot
of
value
above
and
beyond
the
surrender
value
and
it’s
proper
to
take
that
into
account
in
determining
the
value
of
the
insurance
policy.
but
same
thing
is
equally
applicable
here.
mutual
fund
shares
are
widely
sold
on
the
representation
which
has
great
substance
but
this
is
the
only
way
that
a
small
investor
can
get
diversification.
they
are
also
sold
on
the
representation
which
may
or
may
not
work
out
an
experience
but
presumably
has
some
effect
to
it
and
at
least
for
which
people
are
wiling
to
pay
that
through
the
mutual
fund,
you
can
get
expert
management.
you
can
get
before
your
relatively
small
investment
the
same
kind
of
supervision
and
watching
and
care
and
foresight
that
a
very
large
investor
can
have.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
well,
yes
mr.
justice.
guggenheim
and
rasquin,
and
the
life
insurance
policy
is
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
under
any
conditions
the
--
well,
i
don’t
know
what
to
say.
just
as
much
as
here
because
the
share
may
be
valued
at
its
net
asset
value
on
the
decedent’s
death
at
$10,000,
let
us
say,
although,
he
can
only
realize
9,200
by
turning
it
in.
but
by
the
time,
he
does
turn
it
in,
the
market
has
gone
way
up
and
he
gets
$11,000
for
it.
there’s
no
impossibility
of
his
obtaining
the
full
amount
of
the
value
which
is
determined
at
the
date
of
the
decedent’s
death.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no,
i
don’t
think
you
would
add
any
load
charge
on
to
that.
if
he’s
later
sold
the
shares
for
$10,000
--
for
$11,000,
he
would
have
a
gain
of
$1,000
and
of
only
$1,000
although
he
had
in
fact
realized
1,800
more
than
he
could
have
realized
on
the
date
of
death.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
if
the
item
is
sold
on
the
market,
then
you
do
not
take
into
account
either
buying
or
selling
commission.
on
the
other
hand,
if
the
item
is
sold
at
retail,
and
let’s
take
jewelry,
i’ve
already
referred
to
an
automobile.
if
the
item
is
sold
at
retail,
it
is
customarily
and
always
has
been
valued
at
its
retail
price.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no,
mr.
justice.
the
automobile
regulation
goes
back
a
great
many
years,
and
guggenheim-rasquin
goes
back
31
years
now.
but
this
regulation,
not
only
is
12
years
old,
but
it
was
officially
promulgated
more
than
a
year
before
this
decedent
died
and
it
is
in
our
contention
a
permissible
approach
by
the
treasury
to
take
to
this
problem.
as
this
court
has
twice
said
recently
in
correll
and
in
bingler.
alternatives
are
of
course
available.
improvements
might
be
imagined
but
we
do
not
sit
as
a
committee
of
revision
to
perfect
the
administration
of
the
tax
laws.
congress
has
delegated
to
the
commissioner
not
to
the
courts
the
task
of
prescribing
all
needful
rules.
in
this
area
of
limitless
factual
variations,
it
is
the
province
of
congress
and
the
commissioner
not
the
courts
to
make
the
appropriate
adjustment.
the
role
of
the
judiciary
in
cases
of
this
sort
begins
and
ends
with
assuring
that
the
commissioner’s
regulations
fall
within
his
authority
to
implement
the
congressional
mandate
in
some
reasonable
manner.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
correll
is
in
389
u.s.
299.
this
potation
appears
and
the
citations
appears
on
page
9
of
our
brief.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
mr.
justice,
the
regulation
is
not
limited
to
estate
tax.
it
also
applies
expressly
to
the
gift
tax
and
was
issued
on
the
same
day
on
the
same
treasury
decision
with
respect
to
the
gift
tax.
with
respect
to
the
income
tax,
i
know
of
nothing
which
makes
clear
any
practice.
in
this
respect,
it
is
my
position
and
the
position
which
i
would
advise
the
treasury
to
follow
that
they
should
treat
the
net
asset
the
public
offering
price
as
the
value
for
gift
tax
purposes
for
determining
the
amount
of
the
gift
in
a
deduction
under
the
income
tax.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes,
mr.
justice.
if
they
gave
a
brand
new
automobile,
i
would
think
they
would
be
entitled
to
the
--
let's
say
an
ambulance,
i
think
they
would
be
entitled
to
deduct
the
cost
of
that
automobile
as
a
gift
to
the
hospital.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
if
it
were
a
used
car,
i
think
it
would
be
the
price
which
they
properly
paid
to
a
dealer
in
used
cars.
in
other
words,
the
retail
price
for
a
used
car.
but
let
me
take
--
let
me
take
an
instance
which
seems
to
me
to
be
very
close.
let’s
just
take
a
gift
of
mutual
fund
shares.
suppose
a
man
gives
his
daughter,
$10,000
worth
of
mutual
fund
shares
as
a
christmas
gifts.
he
would
suppose
i
think
that
he
has
made
a
$10,000
gift
and
that
he
should
make
a
corresponding
report
on
a
gift
tax
return.
and
that
is
precisely
what
the
regulation
prescribed.
this
is
on
page
27
of
our
brief.
we
have
set
out
the
gift
tax
return,
likewise,
applicable
with
respect
to
gifts
made
after
october
10,
1963.
now
that
seems
clearly
the
right
value
for
gift
tax
purposes
of
mutual
fund
shares.
and
yet,
there’s
no
basis
for
distinguishing
the
value
for
gift
tax
purposes
and
the
value
for
estate
tax
purposes.
if
the
bid
price
determines
the
value
for
estate
tax
purposes,
then
it
is
hard
to
see
why
the
bid
price
should
not
control
the
value
under
the
gift
tax.
on
this
basis,
the
father
would
have
made
a
gift
of
$9,200
and
not
$10,000.
that
is
his
gift
would
be
valued
at
the
net
asset
value
after
excluding
the
load
and
not
at
the
offering
price
which
was
in
fact
the
price
at
which
the
willing
father
purchased
the
shares
from
a
willing
seller
and
to
me
the
controlling
concept
here
at
least
in
determining
whether
the
treasury
had
a
rational
basis
for
its
conclusion
is
the
retail
price.
the
retail
price
of
these
shares
is
the
public
offering
price
not
the
net
asset.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
that
is
an
administration
expense
which
is
deductible.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
deductible
in
computing
the
net
estate
for
estate
tax
purposes.
not
the
income
of
the
estate.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
but
in
computing
the
united
states
for
estate
tax
purposes.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes,
mr.
justice.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
don’t
think
so
mr.
justice
because
i
think
that
that
really
highlights
the
very
point
i
am
trying
to
make
that
the
difference
between
the
sale
on
the
market
in
which
case
neither
selling
nor
buying
commissions
are
taken
into
account
whether
they
are
paid
or
not.
and
in
the
case
of
an
over-the-counter
share,
if
it’s
sold
on
that
day,
then
that
determines
the
market
price.
if
it
didn’t
sell
on
that
day,
then
you
take
the
mean
between
the
bid
and
the
asked
because
that’s
the
closest
you
can
come.
although,
if
it’s
sold
on
the
day
before
or
the
day
after
that
is
also
sometimes
given
some
weight
in
determining
the
value.
on
the
other
hand
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
what
is
totally
unavailable?
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no,
not
--
you
talked
about
the
over-the-counter
securities.
i’m
talking
about
things
which
are
sold
on
a
market
which
would
include
over-the-counter
securities.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
they
are
sold
on
a
market.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
the
ids
sale
is
not
on
the
market.
it
is
at
retail.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
and
that
to
me
is
the
whole
key
to
this
problem.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
a
person
who
buys
at
retail
ordinarily
cannot
resale
because
he
is
not
a
retailer.
he
is
a
consumer.
if
he
wants
to
dispose
of
whatever
he
buys
whether
it’s
a
fur
coat
or
an
automobile
or
something
else.
she
has
to
find
somebody
who
will
give
him
something
which
will
be
less
than
the
amount
he
paid
for.
nevertheless,
if
the
item
is
a
thing
which
is
customarily
sold
at
retail,
i
think
that
the
value
for
estate
and
gift
tax
purposes
should
be
the
retail
price
but
that
is
in
effect
what
this
court
decided
in
guggenheim
against
rasquin,
that
that
is
the
foundation
for
the
regulation
in
this
case.
that
the
regulation
though
it
may
not
be
inevitable
and
i
do
not
contend
that
it
is,
is
a
rational
regulation
and
that
it
should
be
sustained
by
this
court.
