chief

e.

mr.
solicitor
general,
i
suppose
in
the
settlement
of
a
very
large
estate
running
into
many
millions
of
dollars,
it’s
a
common
experience
to
sell
large
blocks
of
stock,
and
there
are
some
sec
regulations
that
if
they
were
selling
one
block
in
one
company,
they
can’t
sell
it
without
some
clearances
and
additionally,
if
it
were
a
large
block,
it
might
depress
the
market.
so
the
executors
hired
goldman
sachs
to
sell
it
and
the
goldman
sachs
charges
them
a
fee
of
$50,000
to
liquidate
a
couple
of
million
dollars
worth
of
the
stock.
that’s
what,
an
expense
of
administration
or
deductible?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
only
from
the
income
of
the
estate?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
yes.
that’s,
what
i
meant
to
say.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
solicitor
general.
mr.
gregg.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
what
about
the
solicitor
general’s
analogy
with
the
cadillac?
he
took
the
cadillac
back
to
the
dealer.
he
wouldn’t
give
you
the
full
price
for
it
very
likely.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
how
would
the
cadillac
be
valued
if
it
was
on
order
and
the
man
died
as
he
left
the
dealer’s
establishment?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
assuming
he’s
going
to
stand
on
his
contract
to
file
a
claim
against
the
estate
if
he
doesn’t
get
a
check.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
at
least
the
dealer
would
--
the
dealer
might
settle
with
the
executors
by
refunding
or
accepting
just
his
load?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
4%
is
just
like
the
goldman
sachs’
commission
that
solicitor
general
and
i
were
talking
about
isn’t
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
4%.
the
commission
is
an
expense
of
the
administration.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
this
a
difference
in
degree
or
in
principle?
a
degree
between
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
a
degree
isn’t
it?
the
size
of
the
load.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
load
comes
in
this
hypothetical
case
too,
8%.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
if
you’re
liquidating
a
$5
million
block
of
stock
to
pay
an
estate
and
inheritance
taxes,
probably
the
only
feasible
way
to
dispose
off
it
is
to
engage
a
very
skilled
dealer
to
handle
the
liquidation
and
get
the
sec
approval.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
they
say
that
with
a
small
or
a
large
investor.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it’s
a
question
of
mutual
fund.
