justice
thurgood
marshall
in
dunn
v.
blumstein
even
if
he
is
there,
over
the
period
of
time
he
is
not
eligible
to
vote?
justice
thurgood
marshall
if
he
--
how
long
has
he
stayed
in
college
in
connecticut?
does
it
run
up
to
phd?
justice
thurgood
marshall
if
the
person
enrolls
in
the
university
and
the
next
day
he
becomes
a
citizen,
and
the
next
year
votes,
he
is
still
a
non-resident
for
seven
years
so
far
as
university
is
concerned?
justice
thurgood
marshall
if
he
gets
elected
the
mayor
of
town
of
new
haven,
he
is
still
a
non-resident?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
how
in
the
world
do
you
justify
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
how
is
it
reasonable
to
say
that
the
mayor
of
new
haven
is
not
a
resident?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
assume
that
in
my
hypothetical
the
mayor
of
new
haven
is
also
multi-million
dollar's
millionaire
and
he's
paying
his
taxes
regularly?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
say
this
is
rational,
i
want
to
see
how
rational
it
is?
how
can
it
be
rational
when
a
man
can
never
change
his
resident
status?
what's
rational
about
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
respectfully
disagree.
it
draws
a
line
between
people
who
are
outside
of
the
state
and
people
inside
of
the
state.
i'm
talking
about
the
one
who
becomes
a
resident,
the
day
after
he
is
matriculated?
justice
thurgood
marshall
discriminate
between
the
person
who
has
matriculated
as
resident
for
one
day,
is
that
right?
justice
thurgood
marshall
against
those
who
have
been
resident
for
years?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
rationalization
is
there
with
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
could
that
be
rational
for
one
year's
tuition
or
rational
for
seven
years
of
tuition?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
your
rationalization
have
to
be
year,
whether
he
is
in
the
state
or
out
of
the
state
is
not
a
rationalization,
then
i
can
understand?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
can
understand
that
for
the
one
year
he
can
be
--
he
is
a
non-resident
for
that
one
year?
justice
thurgood
marshall
don't
you
think
the
state
of
connecticut,
thinks
that
that's
such
a
wonderful
state
and
if
i
want
to
stay
then?
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
gasoline
tax
restricted
to
the
roads?
justice
thurgood
marshall
yeah.
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
what's
it
got
to
do
with
this
case?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
getting
back
to
the
whether
or
not,
they
have
to
admit,
or
whether
they
could
exclude
nonresidents.
suppose
connecticut
said,
the
university
is
open
only
to
residents
of
the
state
of
connecticut
and
i
am
a
resident
of
the
state
of
hawaii
and
they
refused
to
admit
me,
now
what
constitutional
right
would
i
assert?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
i
want
to
know
what
constitutional
points
are
you
talking
about?
what
right
do
i
have
as
a
nonresident
to
go
to
the
university
of
connecticut?
justice
thurgood
marshall
yes,
sir.
what
constitutional
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
then
you
agree
that
maybe
connecticut
could
do
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
say
that
this
regulation
is
unreasonable.
what
is
your
point,
the
present
regulation?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
connecticut
says,
you
can
do
everything,
including
becoming
the
mayor
of
hartford.
they
don't
need
to
fail
in
any
of
that,
that's
what
connecticut
says?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
can
become
a
resident
and
you
get
a
right
to
vote
and
a
right
to
run
for
public
office
and
incidentally
a
right
to
pay
taxes,
you
get
all
those
rights.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
don't
see
whether
your
argument
covers
that.
he
gets
all
of
the
rights
except
this
one?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well
connecticut
interferes
with
my
right
to
travel
at
least
twice
a
year,
i
have
pay
gasoline
tax
when
i
go
through
there,
but
i
mean
that's
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
well
i
stay
there
sometimes?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
am
wondering
about
that
you
are
putting
all
of
your
eggs
in
the
right
to
travel
basket,
that
is
what
i
am
worried
about?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
are
you
going
to
get
to
the
unreasonable
and
the
irrational
point
any
time
in
your
argument?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that's
the
states
interest
point
but
what
is
the
unreasonable
point?
justice
thurgood
marshall
(inaudible)
justice
thurgood
marshall
(inaudible)
justice
thurgood
marshall
(inaudible)
justice
thurgood
marshall
(inaudible)
justice
thurgood
marshall
those
are
the
states
have
statute
–-
justice
thurgood
marshall
in
dunn
v.
blumstein
even
if
he
is
there,
over
the
period
of
time
he
is
not
eligible
to
vote?
justice
thurgood
marshall
if
he
--
how
long
has
he
stayed
in
college
in
connecticut?
does
it
run
up
to
phd?
justice
thurgood
marshall
if
the
person
enrolls
in
the
university
and
the
next
day
he
becomes
a
citizen,
and
the
next
year
votes,
he
is
still
a
non-resident
for
seven
years
so
far
as
university
is
concerned?
justice
thurgood
marshall
if
he
gets
elected
the
mayor
of
town
of
new
haven,
he
is
still
a
non-resident?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
how
in
the
world
do
you
justify
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
how
is
it
reasonable
to
say
that
the
mayor
of
new
haven
is
not
a
resident?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
assume
that
in
my
hypothetical
the
mayor
of
new
haven
is
also
multi-million
dollar's
millionaire
and
he's
paying
his
taxes
regularly?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
say
this
is
rational,
i
want
to
see
how
rational
it
is?
how
can
it
be
rational
when
a
man
can
never
change
his
resident
status?
what's
rational
about
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
respectfully
disagree.
it
draws
a
line
between
people
who
are
outside
of
the
state
and
people
inside
of
the
state.
i'm
talking
about
the
one
who
becomes
a
resident,
the
day
after
he
is
matriculated?
justice
thurgood
marshall
discriminate
between
the
person
who
has
matriculated
as
resident
for
one
day,
is
that
right?
justice
thurgood
marshall
against
those
who
have
been
resident
for
years?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
rationalization
is
there
with
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
could
that
be
rational
for
one
year's
tuition
or
rational
for
seven
years
of
tuition?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
your
rationalization
have
to
be
year,
whether
he
is
in
the
state
or
out
of
the
state
is
not
a
rationalization,
then
i
can
understand?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
can
understand
that
for
the
one
year
he
can
be
--
he
is
a
non-resident
for
that
one
year?
justice
thurgood
marshall
don't
you
think
the
state
of
connecticut,
thinks
that
that's
such
a
wonderful
state
and
if
i
want
to
stay
then?
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
gasoline
tax
restricted
to
the
roads?
justice
thurgood
marshall
yeah.
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
what's
it
got
to
do
with
this
case?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
getting
back
to
the
whether
or
not,
they
have
to
admit,
or
whether
they
could
exclude
nonresidents.
suppose
connecticut
said,
the
university
is
open
only
to
residents
of
the
state
of
connecticut
and
i
am
a
resident
of
the
state
of
hawaii
and
they
refused
to
admit
me,
now
what
constitutional
right
would
i
assert?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
i
want
to
know
what
constitutional
points
are
you
talking
about?
what
right
do
i
have
as
a
nonresident
to
go
to
the
university
of
connecticut?
justice
thurgood
marshall
yes,
sir.
what
constitutional
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
then
you
agree
that
maybe
connecticut
could
do
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
say
that
this
regulation
is
unreasonable.
what
is
your
point,
the
present
regulation?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
connecticut
says,
you
can
do
everything,
including
becoming
the
mayor
of
hartford.
they
don't
need
to
fail
in
any
of
that,
that's
what
connecticut
says?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
can
become
a
resident
and
you
get
a
right
to
vote
and
a
right
to
run
for
public
office
and
incidentally
a
right
to
pay
taxes,
you
get
all
those
rights.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
don't
see
whether
your
argument
covers
that.
he
gets
all
of
the
rights
except
this
one?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well
connecticut
interferes
with
my
right
to
travel
at
least
twice
a
year,
i
have
pay
gasoline
tax
when
i
go
through
there,
but
i
mean
that's
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
well
i
stay
there
sometimes?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
am
wondering
about
that
you
are
putting
all
of
your
eggs
in
the
right
to
travel
basket,
that
is
what
i
am
worried
about?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
are
you
going
to
get
to
the
unreasonable
and
the
irrational
point
any
time
in
your
argument?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that's
the
states
interest
point
but
what
is
the
unreasonable
point?

thurgood
