mr.
hill,
i
understand
one
of
your
or
what
i
thought
your
response
to
justice
white's
first
question
to
be
that
say
if
a
student
from
colorado
goes
to
connecticut,
the
connecticut
rule
may
deny
him
the
benefit
of
this
federally
subsidized
connecticut
education,
but
presumably
the
state
education
in
colorado
is
also
subsidized
by
the
federal
government,
so
this
state
in
colorado

justice
william

the
classical
case
of
the
legislature
is
saying,
from
the
existence
of
fact
'a'
the
existence
of
fact
'b'
will
be
conclusively
presumed
and
when
you're
discussing
the
constitutionality
of
that
you
don't
discuss
necessarily
fact
'b'
or
the
relation
between
fact
'b'
and
fact
'a'
you
discuss
whether
or
not
the
legislature
can
properly
require
the
existence
of
fact
'a'
because
it's
said
that
one
file
is
from
the
other.
i
mean,
that's
more
or
less
what
i
think
what
justice
stewart
is
saying?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
no,
but
you're
there
--
you
meet
that
by
saying
what
the
legislature
has
in
fact
required
is
unconstitutional.
the
particular
line
connecticut
is
drawn
here
is
unconstitutional
and
it
doesn't
necessarily
--
wouldn't
necessarily
turn
i
would
think
on
other
notions
of
residency?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
when
you
have
an
irrebuttable
presumption
you
are
no
longer
dealing
with
a
method
of
proving
something
else.
you
are
dealing
with
something
that
is
itself
a
substantive
requirement,
don't
you?
i
mean,
connecticut
hasn't
say
that
what
we
really
interested
here
is
residence,
but
we
are
going
to
require
to
be
proved
in
a
certain
way.
as
justice
stewart
has
indicated,
it
is
said
that
whatever
residence
may
mean
for
other
things,
the
requirement
to
get
into
connecticut
universities
and
pay
in-state
tuition
are
a,
b,
c,
and
those
are
themselves
substantive
requirements?
