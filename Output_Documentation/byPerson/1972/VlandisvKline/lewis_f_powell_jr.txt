justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
may
i
ask
a
question
in
that
connection?
your
brief
contends
that
constitutional
analysis
is
based
as
your
last
statement
indicates
on
a
restriction
on
the
right
to
travel.
you
have
agreed
that
a
state
may
charge
a
higher
fee
for
a
person
entering
the
state
for
the
first
time
to
attend
its
university
then
to
one,
a
person
who
has
lived
there
say
all
his
life.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
so
let's
assume
for
the
moment
a
bona
fide
nonresident,
but
the
day
arrives
is
confronted
by
a
very
wide
differential
in
fee,
say
5
times
as
high,
the
day
he
arrives,
he
says
i
want
to
become
a
citizen
of
connecticut
from
there
on.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
a
resident,
yes.
so
while
his
right
to
travel
is
concerned,
would
that
not
be
restricted
perhaps
not
as
great
as
you
suggest
in
this
case,
but
nevertheless
there
would
be
a
substantial
restriction
on
his
right
to
travel,
even
though
he
said
i
do
want
to
become
a
citizen
and
--
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
but
you
come
back
basically
to
whether
or
not
there
is
a
restriction
on
the
right
to
travel,
that's
your
constitutional
basis?
