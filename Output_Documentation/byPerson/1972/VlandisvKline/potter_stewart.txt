justice
potter
stewart
you
just
told
us,
but
you're
not
saying
that's
helpful,
but
on
the
other
hand,
unless
i'm
mistaken,
your
brothers
on
the
other
side
are
not
saying
either
that
a
state
university
may
not
charge
a
differential,
a
higher
tuition
of
non-residents
and
than
it
does
to
residents.
it's
attacking
only
the
definition.
isn't
that
there?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
a
non-married
student
would
have
to
live
for
a
solid
year
in
connecticut
before
applying?
justice
potter
stewart
as
i
understand
your
definition
and
a
married
student
would
have
to
be
in
connecticut
at
the
time
he
or
she
applied?
justice
potter
stewart
that's
concerned
at
your
argument,
i
know,
but
i
just
saw
and
i
can
understand
the
issue
because
it's
not
that
clear
to
me.
i
had
thought
that
your
opponents
did
not
say,
did
not
question
the
right
of
a
connecticut
state
university
to
charge
a
higher
tuition
of,
bona
fide
a
non-residents
than
they
do
of
residents.
justice
potter
stewart
but
they
do
attack,
the
presumption
that
once
a
non-resident,
always
a
non-resident
and
the
inability
of
anybody
to
prove
that
he
actually
is
a
bona
fide
resident
of
connecticut
at
some
stage
of
the
game,
isn't
that
it?
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
that's
i
think
really
a
constitutional
analysis
that
this
might
be
promoted
if
we
forget
about
residents
and
nonresidents
and
just
the
question
is
whether
or
not
the
state
can
create
categories
that
you
have
just
described,
that
a
person
who
when
he
applies
and
has
admitted
to
a
state
university
in
connecticut
is
a
nonresident,
can
connecticut
say
that
no
matter
whether
or
not,
he
later
becomes
a
bona
fide
resident
for
every
other
purpose,
nonetheless,
for
this
purpose
we
categorize
him
as
a
person
who
has
to
pay
higher
tuition?
justice
potter
stewart
that's
really
is,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
and
i
think
maybe
when
we
talk
about
residents
for
other
purposes,
we
get
--
cloud
the
analysis
a
little
bit?
justice
potter
stewart
no,
i
am
just
suggesting
it
and
for
me
at
least
it
helps
to
--
justice
potter
stewart
that
--
you
know
that
in
hypothetical
case
that
person
might
or
might
not
if
were
son
of
parents
living
in
chicago
who
were
paying
all
his
expenses
and
if
he
is
driving
a
car
with
the
chicago
license
plate
and
went
back
for
every
vacation
and
spent
the
summers
back
home
in
illinois
he
wouldn't
have
become
eligible
--
justice
potter
stewart
well,
isn't
that
more
or
less
a
typical
student
at
least
at
one
side?
justice
potter
stewart
most
of
them
have
living
parents
and
who
go
home
for
vacations
and
they
will
retain
their
--
justice
potter
stewart
isn't
it
therefore
a
question
of
fact
in
each
case,
whether
a
person
has
actually
become
a
resident
of
the
place
where
he
has
going
to
college?
justice
potter
stewart
and
went
home
for
christmas.
justice
potter
stewart
consider
that
home
back
in
chicago,
he
wouldn't
be
able
to
be
resident
of
connecticut.
justice
potter
stewart
has
it
ever
been
overcome
in
that
case?
justice
potter
stewart
--
where
the
court
begins
by
saying
that
we
must
find
a
compelling
state
interest,
has
the
state
ever
won
a
case?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
the
statute
talks
in
terms
of
legal
address,
legal
address.
now
that
doesn't
say
domicile
or
residence.
it
maybe
the
student's
legal
address
was
some
number
in
yale
station
and
maybe
it
was
in
some
straight
out
chicago,
illinois,
acknowledging
that.
justice
potter
stewart
but
the
test
is
legal
address,
whatever
that
may
mean?
justice
potter
stewart
connecticut
says
we're
not
interested
in
the
test,
in
the
ordinary
conventional,
traditional,
legal
test
of
domicile
or
residence.
instead
of
that
we're
going
to
make
different
categories.
whether
or
not
a
person
later
becomes
a
resident,
we
don't
care.
we're
just
going
to
say,
we're
not
dealing
with
individuals.
we're
dealing
with
many
large
groups
and
for
administrative
convenience,
we're
just
going
to
say
that
a
person
who
when
he
applies
to
our
state
university,
applies
from
outside
of
connecticut,
we're
going
to
charge
a
higher
tuition
of
that
person,
so
long
as
he
attends
our
state
university,
whether
or
not
he
ever
becomes
a
resident
or
doesn't.
now
that's
the
question
in
this
case
whether
connecticut
can
do
that
quite
apart
from
any
normal,
traditional
concepts
of
common
law
residence
or
domicile.
isn't
that
the
question?
justice
potter
stewart
why
not?
reading
the
statute,
that's
what
it
says?
justice
potter
stewart
we
may
make
a
presumption
that
an
applicant
from
out
of
state
probably
has
not
been
contributing
to
the
tax
basis
of
connecticut
until
he
--
before
that
time.
now
that
maybe
a
presumption
in
an
individual
case
that's
contrary
to
the
fact,
but
the
question
is
can
they
constitutionally
make
such
a
presumption?
justice
potter
stewart
as
the
question
--
justice
potter
stewart
isn't
that
the
question?
justice
potter
stewart
you're
answering
the
question,
but
what
i'm
asking
is,
what
is
the
question
in
this
case?
it's
not
a
matter
of
residence
or
non-residence.
it's
a
matter
of
can
connecticut
have
this
particular
law,
constitutionally?
isn't
that
it,
to
put
very
simply?
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
dziamba,
do
you
attack
the
basic
constitutional
right
of
the
state
of
connecticut's
universities
and
colleges
to
charge
a
higher
tuition
to
bona
fide
non-residents
and
they
do
the
bona
fide
residents?
justice
potter
stewart
well
then,
that's
all
it's
about,
because
the
bona
fide
a
non-resident
certainly
while
he
is
in
the
state
uses
the
roads
and
pays
gasoline
taxes
and
so
on.
but
i
didn't
think
you
were
making
that
attack?
justice
potter
stewart
it
might
not
be
wanting
to
protect
itself
against
any
evil,
it's
just
what
purpose
is
the
state
trying
to
accomplish
and
that
would
be
very
obvious.
it's
trying
to
give
a
higher
education
to
its
residents,
being
a
sovereign
state?
justice
potter
stewart
no,
that's
quite
a
different
question.
that's
a
wholly
different
question
from
the
one
justice
blackmun
asked
you?
justice
potter
stewart
that
is
the
standard,
that's
the
new
standard
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
since
the
decision
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
of
a
district
court.
justice
potter
stewart
right.
that's
the
attorney
general's
opinion.
justice
potter
stewart
though
she
applied
as
a
single
woman,
from
out
of
state
and
then
almost
very
soon
they
are
after
marriage
moved
to
connecticut?
justice
potter
stewart
in
fact
it
is
a
very
similar
case
to
justice
white's
hypothetical
case?
justice
potter
stewart
you
just
told
us,
but
you're
not

that's
