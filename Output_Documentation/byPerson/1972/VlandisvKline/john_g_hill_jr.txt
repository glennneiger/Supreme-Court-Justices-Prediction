mr.
john
g.
hill,
jr.
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
named
appellant
in
this
case
is
john
vlandis
who
was
the
director
of
admissions
at
the
university
of
connecticut.
the
appellees
were
both
students
at
the
time
of
the
bringing
of
this
action
and
what
they
seek
to
question
is
the
constitutionality
of
a
connecticut
general
statute,
setting
an
out
of
state
differential
in
tuition
for
students.
and
they
particularly
single
in
on
a
line
of
a
statute,
which
states
that
once
the
out
of
state
status
has
been
determined,
the
students
shall
maintain
the
status
for
the
balance
of
his
or
her
attendance
at
the
institute
of
higher
education.
i
would
point
out
that
although
the
word
permanent
is
used
throughout
the
briefs
and
in
the
record
below,
the
statute
is
not
permanent
in
the
complete
sense,
in
that
a
student
originally
out
of
state,
may
still
come
into
connecticut
before
applying
for
admission,
and
at
that
time,
gain
in-state
status.
so
i
think
what
we've
really
got
here
is
something
more
than
permanent.
i
think
what
is
really
being
argued
is
a
durational
test
for
tuition
differentials.
now
this
is
the
point
that
is
specifically
brought
up
on
the
amicus
briefs
and
were
filed
by
the
university
of
washington
and
also
by
the
civil
liberties
union
of
ohio.
i
think
that
is
the
real
question
that
is
here
before
the
court,
mainly
what
durational
test
can
a
state
place
in
making
this
discrimination
as
to
in-state
or
out-state.
it's
a
question
of
considerable
importance.
one
analyst
estimates
that
some
$300-400
million
maybe
as
stake
for
state
supported
institutions
of
higher
education.
i
think
my
particular
problem
that
i
have
to
persuade
the
court
as
to
is
whether
or
not
the
court's
decision
in
dunn
v.
blumstein
should
be
expanded
to
cover
an
out
of
states
tuition
situation
rather
than
voting
rights.
and
it's
this
i'm
going
to
address
myself
too
because
i
think
this
is
the
particular
question
that
i
have
to
make.
mr.
john
g.
hill,
jr.
that
is
correct
your
honor,
that
is
--
mr.
john
g.
hill,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
yes,
phd
is
offered.
mr.
john
g.
hill,
jr.
well,
your
honor,
that
is
the
way
it's
been
interpreted.
actually,
it's
been
interpreted
that
there
could
be
a
break
after
they
award
the
degree,
but
your
principle
is
correct,
your
honor,
that
once
he
has
established
say
he
comes
to
the
university
of
connecticut,
he
is
a
freshman,
he
is
going
to
--
he
is
classified
out
of
state
to
begin
with,
he
is
going
to
remain
out
of
state.
mr.
john
g.
hill,
jr.
that
is
correct
your
honor.
mr.
john
g.
hill,
jr.
your
honor,
i
justify
that
on
this
basis.
dunn
v.
blumstein
set
up
a
formula
that
applied
to
voting
rights.
it
was
almost
a
mechanistic
formula.
it
said
any
durational
residence
requirement
triggered
this
consuming
state
interest
standard.
a
standard
which
i
have
to
agree
with
the
chief
justice's
words
in
that
case,
is
almost
an
insurmountable
obstacle
for
the
state
to
meet,
but
i
think
it's
fair
for
the
state
--
for
this
court
to
limit
the
judgment
in
dunn
v.
blumstein
to
a
voting
situation
or
as
it
did
in
shapiro
to
a
welfare
situation.
i
think
we're
talking
about
something
different
when
we're
talking
about
a
tuition
differential.
we're
not
trying
to
say
in
this
case
that
the
person
cannot
establish
residency
for
voting
purposes.
we're
not
saying
he
can't
establish
it
for
purposes
of
receiving
welfare
as
shapiro
was
based.
what
we
are
saying
is
that
the
court
ought
to
look
to
the
nature
of
the
right
that
is
affected.
in
this
case,
it's
the
right
to
receive
a
subsidized
education
on
the
part
of
the
state.
mr.
john
g.
hill,
jr.
well,
i
think
it's
a
little
more
than
that
your
honor.
i
think
what
they're
saying
is
that
the
state
can't
classify
them
for
that
four-year
period
and
i'm
saying
that
really
what
we've
got
here
is
a
durational
requirement,
because
the
person
can
establish
residency
as
long
as
they're
not
attending
the
institution.
mr.
john
g.
hill,
jr.
that
is
correct
your
honor.
mr.
john
g.
hill,
jr.
that's
correct
and
i
don't
think
that
present
any
particular
hardship,
what
that
means
--
mr.
john
g.
hill,
jr.
they
do
not.
mr.
john
g.
hill,
jr.
that's
right
and
they
should
have
the
opportunity
to
show
a
changed
circumstance.
mr.
john
g.
hill,
jr.
and
what
i'm
arguing
is
that
under
the
“rational
basis”
test,
this
--
what
amounts
to
a
one
year
waiting
period
is
a
rational
approach
for
the
state
to
take
to
help
finance
the
system
of
higher
education,
because
we're
not
talking
about
even
the
out
of
state
person
deferring
the
entire
cost
of
his
education.
this
is
still
heavily
subsidized
by
the
state
and
i
think
this
is
true
in
every
state.
what
i
am
arguing
is,
that
this
is
a
reasonable
judgment
for
the
legislature
to
make.
this
is
a
reasonable
way
to
approach
the
problem
and
i
think
it's
the
same
principle
that
--
mr.
john
g.
hill,
jr.
he
is
not
a
resident
for
tuition
purposes,
mr.
justice.
we're
not
saying
that
he
is
a
not
a
resident
that
he
can't
have
all
the
other
perquisites
of
citizenship.
mr.
john
g.
hill,
jr.
well,
i
think
the
argument
mr.
chief
justice
is
that
--
mr.
john
g.
hill,
jr.
what's
rational
is
that
the
state
is
seeking
to
support
higher
education
and
it
in
effect
divides
the
students
into
two
classes,
out
of
state
and
in-state
and
it
does
say
--
mr.
john
g.
hill,
jr.
yes
sir,
that
is
correct.
and
if
that
person
gives
--
mr.
john
g.
hill,
jr.
yeah,
while
a
person
taking
the
example
--
mr.
john
g.
hill,
jr.
that
is
correct.
mr.
john
g.
hill,
jr.
because
the
legislature
wanted
to
draw
a
line,
it
chose
to
draw
was
this
one-year
residence
duration.
now
this
is
not
as
a
--
mr.
john
g.
hill,
jr.
well,
my
point
is
your
honor
any
time
this
person
wants
to
us
--
anytime
mayor
of
new
haven
wants
to
establish
residency
for
tuition
purposes,
all
he
has
to
do
is
withdraw
from
the
university
and
that
indicates
that
he
is
not
in
the
state
purely
for
purposes
of
getting
state
education.
he
then
puts
in
his
year
while
he
is
not
a
student,
and
then
he
can
qualify
and
have
all
of
the
perquisites
of
education
that
the
state
offers.
this
is
a
way
to
make
a
differentiation
between
people
who
are
out
of
state
and
in-state.
mr.
john
g.
hill,
jr.
well,
let
me
try
it
a
different
way.
mr.
john
g.
hill,
jr.
well
--
what
the
statute
really
operates
on
your
honor,
if
i
can
read
the
legislative
intent
correctly,
is
that
there
is
a
presumption
that
the
person
who
comes
into
the
state
and
attends
an
institution
of
higher
education
is
here
not
to
become
a
bona
fide
resident
of
the
state,
but
to
secure
advantages
and
public
eduction.
mr.
john
g.
hill,
jr.
well,
your
honor
i
would
hope
they
would
think
that,
but
i
think,
what
i'm
arguing
here
is
what
i
think
was
the
intent
of
the
legislature
in
passing
this
act
and
i
think
that
was
the
design
of
it,
not
to
necessarily
discourage
people
from
coming
in,
but
saying
they
will
not
be
subsidized,
recently
arrived
students
will
not
receive
the
same
subsidy
as
those
who
have
had
been
in
the
state
for
longer
period
of
time
and
--
mr.
john
g.
hill,
jr.
that
is
the
issue,
your
honor.
mr.
john
g.
hill,
jr.
yes,
your
honor,
that
is
the
issue.
mr.
john
g.
hill,
jr.
very
well,
and
i
won't
talk
about
residents
for
other
purpose.
mr.
john
g.
hill,
jr.
alright
then
i
will
zone
in
any
particular
question
that
we
have
here
and
that
is
for
educational
purposes
only.
this
statute
does
not
affect
any
other
rights
of
citizenship,
it
doesn't
affect
boarding,
it
doesn't
affect
the
welfare.
it
is
tied
into
a
modest
differential
in
tuition
for
out
of
state
students,
and
this
is
the
argument
that
i
would
make
today
that
state
supported
education
does
not
fall
in
the
same
category
and
i
think
there's
been
a
whole
line
of
cases
that
i
have
cited
in
my
brief
that
recognizes
this
and
i
would
urge
that
the
court
in
analyzing
this
factual
situation,
judge
it
by
the
rational
basis
test
and
i
think
this
is
an
--
there
are
a
whole
number
of
statutes
across
the
country
on
this
basis,
amicus
brief
is
one
of
them,
in
particular
from
the
state
of
washington.
it
allows
each
state
to
meet
its
own
educational
situation
in
its
own
way.
it
lets
each
state
be
free
to
experiment
with
this
type
of
statute.
many
of
them
say
you
can't
--
that
once
an
out
of
state,
always
an
out
of
state
as
long
as
you
are
taking
less
than
say
6
or
9
or
more
than
6
or
9
credits
at
the
institution.
again,
it's
an
attempt
to
differentiate
between
those
who
are
coming
in
for
educational
purposes
and
those
who
are
really
exercising
their
right
to
travel
and
it
is
admittedly
an
imperfect
method
of
discrimination
in
the
statute.
almost
any
type
of
classification
has
its
imperfections.
i
would
argue
that
this
statute
is
not
so
imperfect
as
to
fail
to
satisfy
the
rational
basis
test.
i
have
cited
in
the
brief
the
expenses
of
education,
the
number
of
out
of
states
students
that
are
in
connecticut,
the
affect
that
this
will
have
on
the
burgeoning
state
budget
in
education.
and
i
would
urge
the
court
to
consider
it
in
that
context
because
that's
really
the
context
we
are
talking
about.
how
are
the
states
going
to
finance
there
systems
of
higher
education?
i
would
submit
that
the
method
adopted
by
connecticut
which
is
in
effect
is
a
year
durational
requirement,
is
a
reasonable
approach
to
that
very
serious
problem.
mr.
john
g.
hill,
jr.
no,
i
don't
your
honor.
i
know
--
mr.
john
g.
hill,
jr.
it
varies.
at
the
university
of
connecticut,
it
would
be
higher,
because
--
mr.
john
g.
hill,
jr.
it
could
well
be
25%,
that
is
correct.
mr.
john
g.
hill,
jr.
well,
they
would
have
the
benefit
of
that
subsidy
at
whatever
--
where
they
qualify.
mr.
john
g.
hill,
jr.
i
am
afraid,
i
don't
understand
your
question
mr.
justice.
mr.
john
g.
hill,
jr.
that
it
all
then
i
would
have
a
very
difficult
argument
i
think,
but
that
is
not
case
--
mr.
john
g.
hill,
jr.
i
think
i
have
figures
here
in
my
brief
where
i
cite
that
even
the
out
of
state
student
is
subsidized
more
than
half
of
the
cost
of
its
education
even
under
the
--
mr.
john
g.
hill,
jr.
some
of
that
may
well
be
federal
government
money
in
the
form
of
all
sorts
of
grants,
that
is
correct.
mr.
john
g.
hill,
jr.
oh,
yes
this
was
really
–
that
was
the
answer.
yes,
that
was
the
answer
i
was
trying
to
make
that
i
don't
mean
to
be
fasicous,
but
everyone
has
to
be
somewhere
and
if
the
student
--
as
in
this
case
mrs.
kline
made
her
application,
she
had
a
choice
at
that
time
whether
she
could
be
a
resident
of
either
arizona
or
california
or
connecticut.
now
if
she
chose
to
go
to
connecticut,
i
say
she
gets
that
out
of
state
status,
but
she
could
have
moved
into
connecticut
and
applied
because
she
was
married
and
then
she
would
not
be
faced
with
this
present
situation.
this
means
the
student
himself
has
to
make
a
choice
before
his
application
of
what
institution
he
is
going
to
attend.
if
he
is
going
to
attend
colorado
and
he
wants
in
state
status,
colorado
is
very
similar
to
ours.
he
would
have
to
move
to
colorado,
establish
that
status
and
then
he
would
receive
the
benefits
of
it.
if
he
lived
in
colorado
to
begin
with
and
he
wanted
to
go
to
connecticut,
he
would
have
to
pay
the
differential.
it
means
the
student
at
the
time
of
his
application
has
status
in
one
particular
state
and
is
unable
to
change
it
except
by
moving;
the
mere
effect
of
admission
and
one
signing
up
to
vote
in
a
new
state
would
not
do
it.
mr.
john
g.
hill,
jr.
he
certainly
would,
mr.
chief
justice.
he
would
--
that's
exactly
my
point.
this
is
not
an
absolute
bar
to
a
person
who
is
obtaining
in-state
status,
it's
a
durational
type
of
thing,
it's
an
effort
by
the
state
to
make
a
reasonable
classification
between
in
and
out
of
state.
mr.
john
g.
hill,
jr.
of
course
not,
and
he
shouldn't.
mr.
john
g.
hill,
jr.
oh,
i
don't
think
so
today
your
honor.
i
think
more
often
you
will
find
--
mr.
john
g.
hill,
jr.
well,
a
good
number
of
them
don't.
mr.
john
g.
hill,
jr.
under
the
example
of
the
chief
justice
gave,
that
would
be
a
question
of
fact.
if
this
were
a
student
who
say,
i
went
to
trinity
college
in
hartford
and
spent
every
summer
and
every
vacation.
mr.
john
g.
hill,
jr.
right,
he
would
not.
mr.
john
g.
hill,
jr.
he
would
not
have
established
the
bona-fide
is
necessary,
that's
correct.
mr.
john
g.
hill,
jr.
yes,
that's
correct
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
john
g.
hill,
jr.
most
of
the
undergraduates
do
not,
most
of
the
graduates
students
do
interestingly
enough.
most
of
them
do
establish
a
year
round
residence
and
many
of
them
that
come
to
connecticut
come
to
establish
residents
ahead
of
time,
so
that
they
can
have
the
benefit
of
this
in-state
tuition,
but
as
far
as
undergraduates
go,
that
is
correct.
most
do
not,
most
go
home
and
so
on.
in
conclusion,
i
would
only
urge
the
court
to
consider
that
fundamental
legal
proposition
behind
this
that
this
really
i
think
is
a
case
for
a
rational
basis
approach
rather
than
the
compelling
state
interest.
i
am
wiling
to
acknowledge
again
with
the
compelling
state
interest
gives
me
an
obstacle
which
i
don't
think
can
be
overcome.
under
rational
basis
--
mr.
john
g.
hill,
jr.
not
to
my
knowledge,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
john
g.
hill,
jr.
not
that
i
know
off
and
that's
why
i
didn't
pursue
that
argument,
i
wouldn't
take
up
the
court's
time
with
it.
thank
you.
mr.
john
g.
hill,
jr.
i
will
just
make
one
brief
comment
your
honor
and
it
is
really
i
am
not
re-arguing
the
legal
points
in
this,
i
think
some
of
the
questions
pointed
out
some
of
the
seriousness
of
this
problem
and
the
affects
of
it.
if
the
states
are
not
allowed
some
latitude,
i
fear
it
might
very
well
happen
is
that
each
state
might
adopt
such
stringent
prohibitions
or
restrictions
on
admission
of
out
state
students
that
they
may
very
well
lose
the
heterogeneity
of
a
university
which
it
really
requires
and
i
think
this
is
just
a
policy
issue
that
i
would
bring
to
the
court's
attention.
mr.
john
g.
hill,
jr.
i
do
not
think
any
has
exactly
the
same
but.
mr.
john
g.
hill,
jr.
i
think
most
state
do
have
durational
requirements
mr.
justice.
they
do
not
have
them
fit
specifically
like
connecticut.
if
you
will
look
at
the
amicus
brief
from
the
university
of
washington,
i
think
you
will
find
there
they
have
a
one
year
limitation
i
think
it
--
mr.
john
g.
hill,
jr.
it
applies
as
long
as
they
are
taking
--
the
student
is
taking
less
than
six
credits
at
the
state
institution.
mr.
john
g.
hill,
jr.
north
carolina
has
it,
arizona
has
it,
the
nebraska
has
it,
i
cited
the
nebraska
in
my
brief,
california
has
it,
your
starns
versus
malkerson,
minnesota
has
it.
i
think
most
of
the
states
have
a
durational
requirement
of
one
--
mr.
john
g.
hill,
jr.
it
can
never
be
changed
as
long
as
the
student
is
in
attendance
at
the
institution
and
taking
a
certain
number
of
credits.
mr.
john
g.
hill,
jr.
yes,
your
honor
i
think
it
was.
i
think
in
the
university
of
minnesota
as
long
they
are
taking
less
than
six
credits,
they
cannot
establish
residence.
i
maybe
wrong,
i
am
quite
sure
that
is
the
case
in
the
washington.
mr.
john
g.
hill,
jr.
that
is
correct.
mr.
john
g.
hill,
jr.
you
have
put
your
finger
specifically
on
the
part
of
the
statute
where
there
are
problems
raised.
this
is
the
specific
type
of
things
where
there
is
a
hardships
and
i
recognize
this
in
my
brief.
mr.
john
g.
hill,
jr.
any
classification
you
have
--
mr.
john
g.
hill,
jr.
i
think
its
constitutional
on
the
ground
that
this
is
a
reasonable
method
for
classification.
any
type
of
classification
is
going
to
bring
up
fringe
cases
where
there
are
hardships.
i
don't
know
how
this
can
be
avoided
and
you
picked
up
one
that
is
occurred
to
me
and
it
hasn't
to
come
up
practically,
but
it
occurs
to
me
this
is
a
hardship,
but
i
think
this
is
true
with
any
type
of
classification,
i
cannot
think
of
one.
mr.
john
g.
hill,
jr.
she
would
have
had
no
hardship
except
she
was
caught
while
a
law
was
in
period
of
flex.
all
that
the
client
had
to
do
is
move
to
connecticut
and
she
could
apply
and
she
would
have
granted
in-state
status.
there
is
no
problem
there.
she
was
caught
because
the
time
when
she
first
applied,
the
act
was
still
pending.
that
is
the
only
reason
why
mrs.
kline
was
in
trouble.
mr.
john
g.
hill,
jr.
that's
correct.
mr.
john
g.
hill,
jr.
but
had
she
married
before
moving
to
connecticut
that
would
have
been
no
problem.
she
would
have
been
admitted,
no
problem
your
honor.
but
i
do
recognize
the
worth
of
your
example,
this
is
one
of
the
hardships
i
acknowledge
it
--
mr.
john
g.
hill,
jr.
i
am
sorry
your
honor.
the
woman
who
--
mr.
john
g.
hill,
jr.
no,
no,
no.
mr.
john
g.
hill,
jr.
no
this
is
what
interesting
your
honor.
she
attended
the
university
of
california
as
a
state
resident
and
presumably
could
have
continued
to
do
so,
but
she
chose
to
go
to
connecticut.
this
was
the
point
i
was
trying
to
respond
i
think
to
yours
and
to
justice
rehnquist's
question.
everybody
has
to
be
somewhere.
she
was
a
resident
of
california
at
that
time
and
i
think
she
was
then
given
that
status.
mr.
john
g.
hill,
jr.
she
would
have
been
alright.
mr.
john
g.
hill,
jr.
that
is
correct.
mr.
john
g.
hill,
jr.
that
is
correct,
but
you
see
--
mr.
john
g.
hill,
jr.
well,
that
is
not
so
bad
you
see
if
you
stopped
to
think.
she
could
have
applied,
no
your
honor
please,
she
could
have
applied
to
seven
or
eight
state
institutions
and
then
wait
and
then
said
well
i
think
i
will
go
to
this
one
and
then
come
in
and
try
to
establish
in-state
status.
this
statute
prevents
that
type
of
situation.
mr.
john
g.
hill,
jr.
all
classifications
have
to
be
drawn
at
some
point
on
the
either
side
of
that
you
are
going
to
find
the
health
situations.
i
thank
the
court.
mr.
john
g.
hill,
jr.
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
named
appellant
in
this
case
is
john
vlandis
who
was
the
director
of
admissions
at
the
university
of
connecticut.
the
appellees
were
both
students
at
the
time
of
the
bringing
of
this
action
and
what
they
seek
to
question
is
the
constitutionality
of
a
connecticut
general
statute,
setting
an
out
of
state
differential
in
tuition
for
students.
and
they
particularly
single
in
on
a
line
of
a
statute,
which
states
that
once
the
out
of
state
status
has
been
determined,
the
students
shall
maintain
the
status
for
the
balance
of
his
or
her
attendance
at
the
institute
of
higher
education.
i
would
point
out
that
although
the
word
permanent
is
used
throughout
the
briefs
and
in
the
record
below,
the
statute
is
not
permanent
in
the
complete
sense,
in
that
a
student
originally
out
of
state,
may
still
come
into
connecticut
before
applying
for
admission,
and
at
that
time,
gain
in-state
status.
so
i
think
what
we've
really
got
here
is
something
more
than
permanent.
i
think
what
is
really
being
argued
is
a
durational
test
for
tuition
differentials.
now
this
is
the
point
that
is
specifically
brought
up
on
the
amicus
briefs
and
were
filed
by
the
university
of
washington
and
also
by
the
civil
liberties
union
of
ohio.
i
think
that
is
the
real
question
that
is
here
before
the
court,
mainly
what
durational
test
can
a
state
place
in
making
this
discrimination
as
to
in-state
or
out-state.
it's
a
question
of
considerable
importance.
one
analyst
estimates
that
some
$300-400
million
maybe
as
stake
for
state
supported
institutions
of
higher
education.
i
think
my
particular
problem
that
i
have
to
persuade
the
court
as
to
is
whether
or
not
the
court's
decision
in
dunn
v.
blumstein
should
be
expanded
to
cover
an
out
of
states
tuition
situation
rather
than
voting
rights.
and
it's
this
i'm
going
to
address
myself
too
because
i
think
this
is
the
particular
question
that
i
have
to
make.
mr.
john
g.
hill,
jr.
that
is
correct
your
honor,
that
is
--
mr.
john
g.
hill,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
yes,
phd
is
offered.
mr.
john
g.
hill,
jr.
well,
your
honor,
that
is
the
way
it's
been
interpreted.
actually,
it's
been
interpreted
that
there
could
be
a
break
after
they
award
the
degree,
but
your
principle
is
correct,
your
honor,
that
once
he
has
established
say
he
comes
to
the
university
of
connecticut,
he
is
a
freshman,
he
is
going
to
--
he
is
classified
out
of
state
to
begin
with,
he
is
going
to
remain
out
of
state.
mr.
john
g.
hill,
jr.
that
is
correct
your
honor.
mr.
john
g.
hill,
jr.
your
honor,
i
justify
that
on
this
basis.
dunn
v.
blumstein
set
up
a
formula
that
applied
to
voting
rights.
it
was
almost
a
mechanistic
formula.
it
said
any
durational
residence
requirement
triggered
this
consuming
state
interest
standard.
a
standard
which
i
have
to
agree
with
the
chief
justice's
words
in
that
case,
is
almost
an
insurmountable
obstacle
for
the
state
to
meet,
but
i
think
it's
fair
for
the
state
--
for
this
court
to
limit
the
judgment
in
dunn
v.
blumstein
to
a
voting
situation
or
as
it
did
in
shapiro
to
a
welfare
situation.
i
think
we're
talking
about
something
different
when
we're
talking
about
a
tuition
differential.
we're
not
trying
to
say
in
this
case
that
the
person
cannot
establish
residency
for
voting
purposes.
we're
not
saying
he
can't
establish
it
for
purposes
of
receiving
welfare
as
shapiro
was
based.
what
we
are
saying
is
that
the
court
ought
to
look
to
the
nature
of
the
right
that
is
affected.
in
this
case,
it's
the
right
to
receive
a
subsidized
education
on
the
part
of
the
state.
mr.
john
g.
hill,
jr.
well,
i
think
it's
a
little
more
than
that
your
honor.
i
think
what
they're
saying
is
that
the
state
can't
classify
them
for
that
four-year
period
and
i'm
saying
that
really
what
we've
got
here
is
a
durational
requirement,
because
the
person
can
establish
residency
as
long
as
they're
not
attending
the
institution.
mr.
john
g.
hill,
jr.
that
is
correct
your
honor.
mr.
john
g.
hill,
jr.
that's
correct
and
i
don't
think
that
present
any
particular
hardship,
what
that
means
--
mr.
john
g.
hill,
jr.
they
do
not.
mr.
john
g.
hill,
jr.
that's
right
and
they
should
have
the
opportunity
to
show
a
changed
circumstance.
mr.
john
g.
hill,
jr.
and
what
i'm
arguing
is
that
under
the
“rational
basis”
test,
this
--
what
amounts
to
a
one
year
waiting
period
is
a
rational
approach
for
the
state
to
take
to
help
finance
the
system
of
higher
education,
because
we're
not
talking
about
even
the
out
of
state
person
deferring
the
entire
cost
of
his
education.
this
is
still
heavily
subsidized
by
the
state
and
i
think
this
is
true
in
every
state.
what
i
am
arguing
is,
that
this
is
a
reasonable
judgment
for
the
legislature
to
make.
this
is
a
reasonable
way
to
approach
the
problem
and
i
think
it's
the
same
principle
that
--
mr.
john
g.
hill,
jr.
he
is
not
a
resident
for
tuition
purposes,
mr.
justice.
we're
not
saying
that
he
is
a
not
a
resident
that
he
can't
have
all
the
other
perquisites
of
citizenship.
mr.
john
g.
hill,
jr.
well,
i
think
the
argument
mr.
chief
justice
is
that
--
mr.
john
g.
hill,
jr.
what's
rational
is
that
the
state
is
seeking
to
support
higher
education
and
it
in
effect
divides
the
students
into
two
classes,
out
of
state
and
in-state
and
it
does
say
--
mr.
john
g.
hill,
jr.
yes
sir,
that
is
correct.
and
if
that
person
gives
--
mr.
john
g.
hill,
jr.
yeah,
while
a
person
taking
the
example
--
mr.
john
g.
hill,
jr.
that
is
correct.
mr.
john
g.
hill,
jr.
because
the
legislature
wanted
to
draw
a
line,
it
chose
to
draw
was
this
one-year
residence
duration.
now
this
is
not
as
a
--
mr.
john
g.
hill,
jr.
well,
my
point
is
your
honor
any
time
this
person
wants
to
us
--
anytime
mayor
of
new
haven
wants
to
establish
residency
for
tuition
purposes,
all
he
has
to
do
is
withdraw
from
the
university
and
that
indicates
that
he
is
not
in
the
state
purely
for
purposes
of
getting
state
education.
he
then
puts
in
his
year
while
he
is
not
a
student,
and
then
he
can
qualify
and
have
all
of
the
perquisites
of
education
that
the
state
offers.
this
is
a
way
to
make
a
differentiation
between
people
who
are
out
of
state
and
in-state.
mr.
john
g.
hill,
jr.
well,
let
me
try
it
a
different
way.
mr.
john
g.
hill,
jr.
well
--
what
the
statute
really
operates
on
your
honor,
if
i
can
read
the
legislative
intent
correctly,
is
that
there
is
a
presumption
that
the
person
who
comes
into
the
state
and
attends
an
institution
of
higher
education
is
here
not
to
become
a
bona
fide
resident
of
the
state,
but
to
secure
advantages
and
public
eduction.
mr.
john
g.
hill,
jr.
well,
your
honor
i
would
hope
they
would
think
that,
but
i
think,
what
i'm
arguing
here
is
what
i
think
was
the
intent
of
the
legislature
in
passing
this
act
and
i
think
that
was
the
design
of
it,
not
to
necessarily
discourage
people
from
coming
in,
but
saying
they
will
not
be
subsidized,
recently
arrived
students
will
not
receive
the
same
subsidy
as
those
who
have
had
been
in
the
state
for
longer
period
of
time
and
--
mr.
john
g.
hill,
jr.
that
is
the
issue,
your
honor.
mr.
john
g.
hill,
jr.
yes,
your
honor,
that
is
the
issue.
mr.
john
g.
hill,
jr.
very
well,
and
i
won't
talk
about
residents
for
other
purpose.
mr.
john
g.
hill,
jr.
alright
then
i
will
zone
in
any
particular
question
that
we
have
here
and
that
is
for
educational
purposes
only.
this
statute
does
not
affect
any
other
rights
of
citizenship,
it
doesn't
affect
boarding,
it
doesn't
affect
the
welfare.
it
is
tied
into
a
modest
differential
in
tuition
for
out
of
state
students,
and
this
is
the
argument
that
i
would
make
today
that
state
supported
education
does
not
fall
in
the
same
category
and
i
think
there's
been
a
whole
line
of
cases
that
i
have
cited
in
my
brief
that
recognizes
this
and
i
would
urge
that
the
court
in
analyzing
this
factual
situation,
judge
it
by
the
rational
basis
test
and
i
think
this
is
an
--
there
are
a
whole
number
of
statutes
across
the
country
on
this
basis,
amicus
brief
is
one
of
them,
in
particular
from
the
state
of
washington.
it
allows
each
state
to
meet
its
own
educational
situation
in
its
own
way.
it
lets
each
state
be
free
to
experiment
with
this
type
of
statute.
many
of
them
say
you
can't
--
that
once
an
out
of
state,
always
an
out
of
state
as
long
as
you
are
taking
less
than
say
6
or
9
or
more
than
6
or
9
credits
at
the
institution.
again,
it's
an
attempt
to
differentiate
between
those
who
are
coming
in
for
educational
purposes
and
those
who
are
really
exercising
their
right
to
travel
and
it
is
admittedly
an
imperfect
method
of
discrimination
in
the
statute.
almost
any
type
of
classification
has
its
imperfections.
i
would
argue
that
this
statute
is
not
so
imperfect
as
to
fail
to
satisfy
the
rational
basis
test.
i
have
cited
in
the
brief
the
expenses
of
education,
the
number
of
out
of
states
students
that
are
in
connecticut,
the
affect
that
this
will
have
on
the
burgeoning
state
budget
in
education.
and
i
would
urge
the
court
to
consider
it
in
that
context
because
that's
really
the
context
we
are
talking
about.
how
are
the
states
going
to
finance
there
systems
of
higher
education?
i
would
submit
that
the
method
adopted
by
connecticut
which
is
in
effect
is
a
year
durational
requirement,
is
a
reasonable
approach
to
that
very
serious
problem.
mr.
john
g.
hill,
jr.
no,
i
don't
your
honor.
i
know
--
mr.
john
g.
hill,
jr.
it
varies.
at
the
university
of
connecticut,
it
would
be
higher,
because
--
mr.
john
g.
hill,
jr.
it
could
well
be
25%,
that
is
correct.
mr.
john
g.
hill,
jr.
well,
they
would
have
the
benefit
of
that
subsidy
at
whatever
--
where
they
qualify.
mr.
john
g.
hill,
jr.
i
am
afraid,
i
don't
understand
your
question
mr.
justice.
mr.
john
g.
hill,
jr.
that
it
all
then
i
would
have
a
very
difficult
argument
i
think,
but
that
is
not
case
--
mr.
john
g.
hill,
jr.
i
think
i
have
figures
here
in
my
brief
where
i
cite
that
even
the
out
of
state
student
is
subsidized
more
than
half
of
the
cost
of
its
education
even
under
the
--
mr.
john
g.
hill,
jr.
some
of
that
may
well
be
federal
government
money
in
the
form
of
all
sorts
of
grants,
that
is
correct.
mr.
john
g.
hill,
jr.
oh,
yes
this
was
really
–
that
was
the
answer.
yes,
that
was
the
answer
i
was
trying
to
make
that
i
don't
mean
to
be
fasicous,
but
everyone
has
to
be
somewhere
and
if
the
student
--
as
in
this
case
mrs.
kline
made
her
application,
she
had
a
choice
at
that
time
whether
she
could
be
a
resident
of
either
arizona
or
california
or
connecticut.
now
if
she
chose
to
go
to
connecticut,
i
say
she
gets
that
out
of
state
status,
but
she
could
have
moved
into
connecticut
and
applied
because
she
was
married
and
then
she
would
not
be
faced
with
this
present
situation.
this
means
the
student
himself
has
to
make
a
choice
before
his
application
of
what
institution
he
is
going
to
attend.
if
he
is
going
to
attend
colorado
and
he
wants
in
state
status,
colorado
is
very
similar
to
ours.
he
would
have
to
move
to
colorado,
establish
that
status
and
then
he
would
receive
the
benefits
of
it.
if
he
lived
in
colorado
to
begin
with
and
he
wanted
to
go
to
connecticut,
he
would
have
to
pay
the
differential.
it
means
the
student
at
the
time
of
his
application
has
status
in
one
particular
state
and
is
unable
to
change
it
except
by
moving;
the
mere
effect
of
admission
and
one
signing
up
to
vote
in
a
new
state
would
not
do
it.
mr.
john
g.
hill,
jr.
he
certainly
would,
mr.
chief
justice.
he
would
--
that's
exactly
my
point.
this
is
not
an
absolute
bar
to
a
person
who
is
obtaining
in-state
status,
it's
a
durational
type
of
thing,
it's
an
effort
by
the
state
to
make
a
reasonable
classification
between
in
and
out
of
state.
mr.
john
g.
hill,
jr.
of
course
not,
and
he
shouldn't.
mr.
john
g.
hill,
jr.
oh,
i
don't
think
so
today
your
honor.
i
think
more
often
you
will
find
--
mr.
john
g.
hill,
jr.
well,
a
good
number
of
them
don't.
mr.
john
g.
hill,
jr.
under
the
example
of
the
chief
justice
gave,
that
would
be
a
question
of
fact.
if
this
were
a
student
who
say,
i
went
to
trinity
college
in
hartford
and
spent
every
summer
and
every
vacation.
mr.
john
g.
hill,
jr.
right,
he
would
not.
mr.
john
g.
hill,
jr.
he
would
not
have
established
the
bona-fide
is
necessary,
that's
correct.
mr.
john
g.
hill,
jr.
yes,
that's
correct
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
john
g.
hill,
jr.
most
of
the
undergraduates
do
not,
most
of
the
graduates
students
do
interestingly
enough.
most
of
them
do
establish
a
year
round
residence
and
many
of
them
that
come
to
connecticut
come
to
establish
residents
ahead
of
time,
so
that
they
can
have
the
benefit
of
this
in-state
tuition,
but
as
far
as
undergraduates
go,
that
is
correct.
most
do
not,
most
go
home
and
so
on.
in
conclusion,
i
would
only
urge
the
court
to
consider
that
fundamental
legal
proposition
behind
this
that
this
really
i
think
is
a
case
for
a
rational
basis
approach
rather
than
the
compelling
state
interest.
i
am
wiling
to
acknowledge
again
with
the
compelling
state
interest
gives
me
an
obstacle
which
i
don't
think
can
be
overcome.
under
rational
basis
--
mr.
john
g.
hill,
jr.
not
to
my
knowledge,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
john
g.
hill,
jr.
not
that
i
know
off
and
that's
why
i
didn't
pursue
that
argument,
i
wouldn't
take
up
the
court's
time
with
it.
thank
you.
mr.
john
g.
hill,
jr.
i
will
just
make
one
brief
comment
your
honor
and
it
is
really
i
am
not
re-arguing
the
legal
points
in
this,
i
think
some
of
the
questions
pointed
out
some
of
the
seriousness
of
this
problem
and
the
affects
of
it.
if
the
states
are
not
allowed
some
latitude,
i
fear
it
might
very
well
happen
is
that
each
state
might
adopt
such
stringent
prohibitions
or
restrictions
on
admission
of
out
state
students
that
they
may
very
well
lose
the
heterogeneity
of
a
university
which
it
really
requires
and
i
think
this
is
just
a
policy
issue
that
i
would
bring
to
the
court's
attention.
mr.
john
g.
hill,
jr.
i
do
not
think
any
has
exactly
the
same
but.
mr.
john
g.
hill,
jr.
i
think
most
state
do
have
durational
requirements
mr.
justice.
they
do
not
have
them
fit
specifically
like
connecticut.
if
you
will
look
at
the
amicus
brief
from
the
university
of
washington,
i
think
you
will
find
there
they
have
a
one
year
limitation
i
think
it
--
mr.
john
g.
hill,
jr.
it
applies
as
long
as
they
are
taking
--
the
student
is
taking
less
than
six
credits
at
the
state
institution.
mr.
john
g.
hill,
jr.
north
carolina
has
it,
arizona
has
it,
the
nebraska
has
it,
i
cited
the
nebraska
in
my
brief,
california
has
it,
your
starns
versus
malkerson,
minnesota
has
it.
i
think
most
of
the
states
have
a
durational
requirement
of
one
--
mr.
john
g.
hill,
jr.
it
can
never
be
changed
as
long
as
the
student
is
in
attendance
at
the
institution
and
taking
a
certain
number
of
credits.
mr.
john
g.
hill,
jr.
yes,
your
honor
i
think
it
was.
i
think
in
the
university
of
minnesota
as
long
they
are
taking
less
than
six
credits,
they
cannot
establish
residence.
i
maybe
wrong,
i
am
quite
sure
that
is
the
case
in
the
washington.
mr.
john
g.
hill,
jr.
that
is
correct.
mr.
john
g.
hill,
jr.
you
have
put
your
finger
specifically
on
the
part
of
the
statute
where
there
are
problems
raised.
this
is
the
specific
type
of
things
where
there
is
a
hardships
and
i
recognize
this
in
my
brief.
mr.
john
g.
hill,
jr.
any
classification
you
have
--
mr.
john
g.
hill,
jr.
i
think
its
constitutional
on
the
ground
that
this
is
a
reasonable
method
for
classification.
any
type
of
classification
is
going
to
bring
up
fringe
cases
where
there
are
hardships.
i
don't
know
how
this
can
be
avoided
and
you
picked
up
one
that
is
occurred
to
me
and
it
hasn't
to
come
up
practically,
but
it
occurs
to
me
this
is
a
hardship,
but
i
think
this
is
true
with
any
type
of
classification,
i
cannot
think
of
one.
mr.
john
g.
hill,
jr.
she
would
have
had
no
hardship
except
she
was
caught
while
a
law
was
in
period
of
flex.
all
that
the
client
had
to
do
is
move
to
connecticut
and
she
could
apply
and
she
would
have
granted
in-state
status.
there
is
no
problem
there.
she
was
caught
because
the
time
when
she
first
applied,
the
act
was
still
pending.
that
is
the
only
reason
why
mrs.
kline
was
in
trouble.
mr.
john
g.
hill,
jr.
that's
correct.
mr.
john
g.
hill,
jr.
but
had
she
married
before
moving
to
connecticut
that
would
have
been
no
problem.
she
would
have
been
admitted,
no
problem
your
honor.
but
i
do
recognize
the
worth
of
your
example,
this
is
one
of
the
hardships
i
acknowledge
it
--
mr.
john
g.
hill,
jr.
i
am
sorry
your
honor.
the
woman
who
--
mr.
john
g.
hill,
jr.
no,
no,
no.
mr.
john
g.
hill,
jr.
no
this
is
what
interesting
your
honor.
she
attended
the
university
of
california
as
a
state
resident
and
presumably
could
have
continued
to
do
so,
but
she
chose
to
go
to
connecticut.
this
was
the
point
i
was
trying
to
respond
i
think
to
yours
and
to
justice
rehnquist's
question.
everybody
has
to
be
somewhere.
she
was
a
resident
of
california
at
that
time
and
i
think
she
was
then
given
that
status.
mr.
john
g.
hill,
jr.
she
would
have
been
alright.
mr.
john
g.
hill,
jr.
that
is
correct.
mr.
john
g.
hill,
jr.
that
is
correct,
but
you
see
--
mr.
john
g.
hill,
jr.
well,
that
is
not
so
bad
you
see
if
you
stopped
to
think.
she
could
have
applied,
no
your
honor
please,
she
could
have
applied
to
seven
or
eight
state
institutions
and
then
wait
and
then
said
well
i
think
i
will
go
to
this
one
and
then
come
in
and
try
to
establish
in-state
status.
this
statute
prevents
that
type
of
situation.
mr.
john
g.
hill,
jr.
all
classifications
have
to
be
drawn
at
some
point
on
the
either
side
of
that
you
are
going
to
find
the
health
situations.
i
thank
the
court.
