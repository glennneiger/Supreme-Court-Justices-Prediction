suppose
the
student
went
to
connecticut
and
enrolled
in
a
private
college,
attended
that
college
for
one
year
maintaining
his
residence
there
of
course,

he
meets
the

the
connecticut
statute

a

your
response
to
my
hypothetical,
then
included
the
proposition
that
in
attending
the
yale
or
some
other
private
school
in
connecticut,
he
had
also
taken
all
the
other
steps
to
establish
legal
residence?
chief
justice
warren
e.

and
probably
i
suppose
it'd
be
fair
to
say
that
most
of
the
students
who
come
to
a
university
like
yale
do
not
establish
a
residence
for

purposes?

but
if
connecticut
could
exclude
all
people,
except
its
own
residents,
in
other
words
did
not
follow
that
it
can
allow
nonresidents
to
come
in
on
any
terms
that
connecticut
wants
to
establish?
chief

e.

you
don't
seriously
question
to
connecticut
could
exclude
all
nonresidents
from
attendance
on

do
you?
chief

warren
e.

well,
that's
a
factual
question.
that's
our
difficulty
with
this
argument
when
they
factor
it
with
the
constitutional
principle,
you
do
concede
that
connecticut
could
say
we
are
going
to
run
our
institutions
of
higher
learning
only
for
the
people
who
live
here?
chief

e.

oh!
you
don't?
chief

what
provision
of

would
prohibit
connecticut
from

mr.

do
you
have
anything
further?
chief

e.

i
suppose
your
answer
in
part
is
that
it
is
like
paying
your
income
tax
one
day
late
that
and
you
get
a
penalty
for
it
because
of
the
arbitrary
classifications.
