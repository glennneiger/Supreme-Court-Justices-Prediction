mr.
john
a.
dziamba
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
like
to
begin
by
responding
to
mr.
justice
stewart's
question
and
the
chief
justice's
hypothetical
as
a
student
going
to
yale.
under
mr.
hill's
answer
he
said,
the
student
would
not
qualify
under
the
present
connecticut
statute
unless
he
cloaked
himself
with
the
other
indicia
of
bona
fide
residents.
well,
i
don't
think
that
that's
an
accurate
response
because
under
the
present
statute
there
is
nothing
he
would
have
to
do.
he
would
not
have
to
cloak
himself
of
any
indicia
of
residence.
he
would
just
merely
have
to
show
that
he
lived
in
connecticut
for
one
year
before
he
applied
to
a
state
university,
he
would
be
accepted
and
he
would
be
accepted
as
an
in-state
student.
mr.
john
a.
dziamba
yes,
if
that
was
not
under
the
statute,
mr.
justice
stewart
that
would
not
be
a
factual
inquiry.
the
student
would
assert
his
legal
address
is
being
blocks
22
at
yale
or
trinity
or
even
if
you
were
living
in
an
apartment
as
chapel
street
in
new
haven,
that
would
be
accepted,
there
would
be
no
individual
examination
of
--
mr.
john
a.
dziamba
whatever
that
may
mean
and
i
assume
that
under
the
statute
whatever
is
asserted
will
be
accepted.
the
troubling
part
about
this
case
is
that
--
i
would
like
to
put
it
into
perspective.
first
of
all,
that
we're
not
dealing
with
college
students
as
college
students,
we're
dealing
with
individuals
who
happen
to
be
in
a
particular
stage
of
their
life
afflicted
with
the
status
of
being
college
students.
what
i'm
trying
to
say
is
that
i
don't
think
this
court
need
evolved
any
particular
and
unique
constitutional
test
for
the
bona
fide
of
residence
of
individuals
just
because
they
happen
to
be
students.
that
rational
criteria
exists
and
are
easily
applied
in
any
factual
situation
to
establish
the
bona
fide
of
residency,
for
instance.
mr.
john
a.
dziamba
no,
i
really
don't
think
so,
mr.
justice
stewart.
mr.
john
a.
dziamba
because
in
the
proper
justifications
by
the
state
for
adopting
that
statute,
they
cite
two
reasons.
they
say,
the
statute
has
to
be
this
way,
because
it
gives
us
an
administratively
easy
way
of
establishing
a
student's
domiciliary
intent.
that's
why
they
say
they
have
to
have
it.
secondly
they
say,
that
it
allows
cost
equalization
between
those
people
who
are
contributing
to
the
tax
basis
of
the
state
of
connecticut
and
those
that
aren't.
mr.
john
a.
dziamba
i
don't
think
so,
because
as
a
result
of
--
mr.
john
a.
dziamba
as
a
result
of
that
presumption
--
mr.
john
a.
dziamba
no,
i
still
don't
think
that's
the
question.
if
i
may
answer,
as
a
result
of
that
presumption
a
student
is
not
allowed,
an
individual
is
not
allowed
to
show
that
he
is
contributing
to
tax
basis.
mr.
john
a.
dziamba
yes,
i
think
that
maybe
the
issue,
but
i
think
that
the
reasons
the
state
says
it
needs
this
law,
and
what
it
is
trying
to
accomplish
by
having
this
law
have
to
be
taken
into
consideration.
what
they
say
is
that
the
law
allows
us
to
determine
the
student's
domiciliary
intent
and
allows
cost
equalization.
if
i
may
set
an
example.
cost
equalization
is
not
contributing
to
its
state
tax
basis,
it's
not
a
insurance
type
program.
for
instance,
in
connecticut
there
are
2000
out
of
state
students
in
the
university
of
connecticut
and
there
is
16,000
total
students.
the
total
budget
of
the
university
of
connecticut
is
between
45
and
47
million
dollars
a
year.
the
sales
tax
and
use
tax
which
are
the
primary
sources
of
income
in
the
state
of
connecticut
produce
an
annual
revenue
of
325
million
dollars
a
year.
the
gasoline
tax
produces
an
annual
revenue
of
$16
million
a
year.
the
cigarette
tax
produces
an
annual
revenue
of
$60
million
a
year.
in
a
recent
--
mr.
john
a.
dziamba
as
a
highway
tax?
mr.
john
a.
dziamba
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
john
a.
dziamba
i'm
putting
into
perspective
merely
in
showing
the
court
that
in
the
total
operating
budget,
and
in
the
amount
of
money
that
would
cost
inversely,
one
of
the
arguments
proffered
by
the
state
and
also
in
terms
of
cost
equalization,
anyone
who
is
in
connecticut,
who
is
either
driving
a
car
or
buying
merchandised
is
in
fact
contributing
to
the
cost
and
to
the
tax
basis
--
mr.
john
a.
dziamba
no,
mr.
justice
stewart.
mr.
john
a.
dziamba
no
i'm
not.
but
i
think
the
attack
is
this.
mrs.
kline
for
instance
who
is
originally
the
named
appellee
in
the
case
did
not
come
into
the
state
primarily
for
education.
it
was
incidental
and
as
a
result
of
that
incidental,
she
is
being
penalized
to
the
extent,
that
she
has
to
pay
for
the
rest
of
the
remainder
at
the
university,
she
must
pay
twice
the
tuition.
what
we're
attacking
is
that
the
state
has
the
right
to
adopt
the
differential
between
those
who
are
bona
fide
residents
and
those
who
are
not.
it's
freezing
in
that
status
that
we
say
violates
very
fundamental
constitutional
rights.
mr.
john
a.
dziamba
are
you
indicating
citizens,
bona
fide
residents?
mr.
john
a.
dziamba
i
think
that's
a
very
difficult
question
and
the
one
that
is
first
of
all
not
presented
by
the
facts
of
this
case
and
i
think
that
it
would
have
to
be
analyzed
in
terms
of
the
standards
already
set
down
by
this
court
and
that
is,
the
state
may
have
a
special
public
interest
it
wants
to
protect,
but
as
the
amicus
points
out
in
its
table
one
a
lot
of
that
money
comes
from
federal
funds
--
that
would
have
to
be
a
clear
showing,
i
think
in
the
record
first
of
all,
as
to
what
evil
the
state
is
trying
to
protect
itself
against
by
limiting
a
state
benefit
only
to
residents
of
that
state.
mr.
john
a.
dziamba
but
it's
the
determination
of
who
is
a
resident,
which
is
a
--
mr.
john
a.
dziamba
yes
sir.
mr.
john
a.
dziamba
well,
i
think
that
the
legislative
presumption
that
has
no
basis
of
fact
is
one
that
would
not
be
allowed.
mr.
john
a.
dziamba
well,
i
again
come
back
to
responding
to
mr.
justice
stewart's
question,
but
i
think
that
that
is
the
point.
i
think
that
the
statute
has
to
be
analyzed
not
only
in
what
it
said,
but
in
the
proffered
purposes.
mr.
john
a.
dziamba
well,
i
think
first
of
all,
mr.
justice
marshall,
those
are
not
the
facts
presented
in
this
case,
but
the
question
then
would
be
first
of
all
how
do
you
establish
residency?
how
can
--
mr.
john
a.
dziamba
as
a
nonresident?
mr.
john
a.
dziamba
i
think
your
honor
that
that
is
a
different
legislative
judgment
on
a
one
made
here.
the
legislative
judgment
in
here
is
that
you
do
have
a
right.
connecticut
has
not
excluded,
you
do
have
a
right,
but
you
must
pay
more.
then
i
think
is
the
issue;
connecticut
has
not
gone
that
far
and
i
would
not
attempt
to
assess
definitively
the
constitution
opinions
going
that
far.
mr.
john
a.
dziamba
i
would
not
say,
i
said
that
you'd
have
to
look
at
the
circumstances,
at
the
amount
of
discrimination
against
whom
they
were
trying
to
keep
out,
why.
the
federal
government
has
recognized
that
education
is
a
large
problem
shared
by
all
of
the
states.
i
think
these
are
all
considerations
that
this
court
has
used
in
other
types
of
situations
and
i
think
that
they
would
be
employed
to
assess
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute.
mr.
john
a.
dziamba
the
present
regulation
is
unreasonable
in
that
it
does
not
allow
change
in
status.
mr.
john
a.
dziamba
i
think
mr
chief
justice
that
--
mr.
john
a.
dziamba
i
think
mr.
chief
justice
the
question
is
how
do
you
determine
residents,
and
is
that
determination
irrational?
mr.
john
a.
dziamba
no
i
don't
concede
that.
mr.
john
a.
dziamba
no,
i
don't.
i
say
that
that
has
to
be
examined
on
a
particular
basis
in
the
record
of
connecticut
would
put
forth
why
they
need
that
particular
exclusion?
mr.
john
a.
dziamba
i
think
that
the
privileges
in
the
immunities
clause
would
prohibit
them
from
excluding
all
nonresidents
unless
they
show
--
unless
they
could
show
particular
reason
why,
and
substantiate
it
on
the
basis
in
fact
on
the
record.
i
think
the
issue
in
this
case
is
how
do
you
establish
residency,
how
do
you
define
residency,
and
is
that
a
rational
definition
of
residency,
and
then
how
do
you
establish
that
residency.
i
think
that
what
happened
in
this
case,
since
the
invalidation
of
the
statute
by
the
lower
court
is
very
instructive
and
that
is
that
connecticut
has
adopted
adequate
criteria
and
as
they
say
that
each
case
--
they
say
that
each
case
is
a
question
of
domicile,
the
present
standard
that
they
have.
now
each
case
must
be
decided
on
its
own
particular
facts
in
that
in
reviewing
a
claim
for
reclassification.
mr.
john
a.
dziamba
the
new
standard.
mr.
john
a.
dziamba
since
the
decision.
mr.
john
a.
dziamba
of
the
district
court.
mr.
john
a.
dziamba
the
attorney
general
opinion,
yes,
and
that's
a
relevant
criteria
for
determining
that
status
in-state
or
out
of
state,
resident
or
nonresident
a
or
b,
include
year
on
residents,
voter
registration,
place
of
filling
tax
returns,
property
ownership,
driver's
license,
connecticut
registration,
marital
status,
vacation
and
employment
plan
and
not
only
the
present
system,
a
student
comes
in
and
fills
out
and
affidavit,
you
may
ask
him,
what
is
your
parent's
address,
who
has
custody
of
you
if
your
parents
are
separated,
what
is
your
age,
what
is
your
address,
what
is
your
marital
status,
all
high
schools
and
colleges
that
you
have
attended
with
their
addresses,
military
service,
periods
and
other
service,
voter
registration,
driver's
license,
automobile
registration,
and
provides
that
falsification
for
this
to
be
grounds
for
expulsion.
and
i
think
mr.
justice
stewart
in
all
candor,
that
this
is
the
objective
of
the
state.
it's
not
to
say
only
for
state
residents
or
only
for
connecticut
residents
but
is
to
determine
who
is
a
bona
fide
resident
of
the
state
and
i
think
this
point
is
borne
out
by
the
appellants
on
brief
by
stating
again
that
the
reason
that
this
particular
irrebuttable
presumption
is
adopted,
is
to
allow
the
state
to
have
facility
in
determining
the
student's
domiciliary
intent
and
to
affect
some
type
of
cost
equalization
between
those
people
who
are
contributing
to
tax
basis
in
this
or
not.
out
position
is
that
there
is
no
reason
for
such
a
drastic,
irrebuttable
presumption
and
adequate
criteria
exists.
this
court
has
well
recognized
and
not
limited
merely
to
the
issues
of
voting
or
welfare
but
that
this
is
the
objective
of
the
state,
we
must
take
the
state
at
its
words
and
this
is
the
objective
of
the
state
then
it
must
pursue
rational
criteria
to
do
that.
mr.
john
a.
dziamba
yes,
when
i
think
that
those
requirements
are
unconstitutional
that
in
that
they
affect
a
penalty
on
the
right
to
travel.
i
think
that
that's
a
proper
analysis.
mr.
john
a.
dziamba
if
that
person,
excuse
me,
if
that
person
does
not
intend
to
become
a
resident
per
se,
bona
fide
nonresident,
yes.
mr.
john
a.
dziamba
a
resident.
mr.
john
a.
dziamba
then
i
think
that
the
individual
increase
and
one
that's
going
to
bring
out
this
--
mr.
john
a.
dziamba
yes.
i
think
there
is
a
restriction
on
the
right
to
travel
for
those
citizens
who
also
finds
students,
those
bona
fide
residents
of
the
state
of
connecticut.
i
think
that
a
student
who
comes
into
a
connecticut
and
says
i
don't
care
about
your
state,
i
don't
care
about
remaining
in
the
state,
i
want
the
benefit
of
the
tuition
and
therefore
i
declare
myself
a
connecticut
resident.
i
think
that
presents
a
vastly
different
--
i
think
the
right
to
travel
is
one
which
is
always
been
recently
i
would
say,
connected
with
establishing
bona
fide
domicile,
a
new
start,
a
new
life,
a
life
with
one's
husband
as
mrs.
kline
did
in
this
case.
her
husband
was
a
life
long
resident
of
the
state
of
connecticut.
mr.
john
a.
dziamba
well
i
think
--
mr.
john
a.
dziamba
and
you
don't
get
any
reduction
in
that
obligation
either.
mr.
john
a.
dziamba
well,
he
is
also
bearing
all
of
the
burdens,
in
that
is
he
doesn't
get
a
reduction
in
his
sales
and
use
tax.
mr.
john
a.
dziamba
well,
that
is
going
through
that
is
not
staying
there
and
live.
mr.
john
a.
dziamba
but
you
do
not
consider
connecticut
your
home.
mr.
john
a.
dziamba
no
i
thank
you
to
statute
is
in
firm
even
under
rational
basis
test,
given
the
proffered
purposes
by
the
state.
mr.
john
a.
dziamba
i
thought
i
covered
that
mr.
justice
marshall
by
saying
that
the
state
has
put
forth
the
reasons
why.
it
needs
this
particular
restriction.
mr.
john
a.
dziamba
the
unreasonable
point
i
think
you
said
there
is
no
way
of
establishing
residency
for
a
particular
purpose
and
i
think
that,
that
is
unreasonable
that
if
you
are
bona
fide
resident
of
state
connecticut
for
any
and
all
purposes
and
you
are
paying
all
the
benefits,
you
are
paying
all
the
burdens
of
taxation,
why
that
particular
benefit,
why
not
exclude
you
from
the
hospitals,
why
not
exclude
you
from
this
state
highways,
why
not
exclude
you
from
the
public
libraries?
i
think
the
state
has
to
show
a
rational
reason
why
they
want
to
exclude
a
bona
fide,
a
new
bona
fide
resident
from
that
particular
state
benefit
and
i
do
not
think
the
state
is
sustained
that
burden
here.
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
john
a.
dziamba
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
like
to
begin
by
responding
to
mr.
justice
stewart's
question
and
the
chief
justice's
hypothetical
as
a
student
going
to
yale.
under
mr.
hill's
answer
he
said,
the
student
would
not
qualify
under
the
present
connecticut
statute
unless
he
cloaked
himself
with
the
other
indicia
of
bona
fide
residents.
well,
i
don't
think
that
that's
an
accurate
response
because
under
the
present
statute
there
is
nothing
he
would
have
to
do.
he
would
not
have
to
cloak
himself
of
any
indicia
of
residence.
he
would
just
merely
have
to
show
that
he
lived
in
connecticut
for
one
year
before
he
applied
to
a
state
university,
he
would
be
accepted
and
he
would
be
accepted
as
an
in-state
student.
mr.
john
a.
dziamba
yes,
if
that
was
not
under
the
statute,
mr.
justice
stewart
that
would
not
be
a
factual
inquiry.
the
student
would
assert
his
legal
address
is
being
blocks
22
at
yale
or
trinity
or
even
if
you
were
living
in
an
apartment
as
chapel
street
in
new
haven,
that
would
be
accepted,
there
would
be
no
individual
examination
of
--
mr.
john
a.
dziamba
whatever
that
may
mean
and
i
assume
that
under
the
statute
whatever
is
asserted
will
be
accepted.
the
troubling
part
about
this
case
is
that
--
i
would
like
to
put
it
into
perspective.
first
of
all,
that
we're
not
dealing
with
college
students
as
college
students,
we're
dealing
with
individuals
who
happen
to
be
in
a
particular
stage
of
their
life
afflicted
with
the
status
of
being
college
students.
what
i'm
trying
to
say
is
that
i
don't
think
this
court
need
evolved
any
particular
and
unique
constitutional
test
for
the
bona
fide
of
residence
of
individuals
just
because
they
happen
to
be
students.
that
rational
criteria
exists
and
are
easily
applied
in
any
factual
situation
to
establish
the
bona
fide
of
residency,
for
instance.
mr.
john
a.
dziamba
no,
i
really
don't
think
so,
mr.
justice
stewart.
mr.
john
a.
dziamba
because
in
the
proper
justifications
by
the
state
for
adopting
that
statute,
they
cite
two
reasons.
they
say,
the
statute
has
to
be
this
way,
because
it
gives
us
an
administratively
easy
way
of
establishing
a
student's
domiciliary
intent.
that's
why
they
say
they
have
to
have
it.
secondly
they
say,
that
it
allows
cost
equalization
between
those
people
who
are
contributing
to
the
tax
basis
of
the
state
of
connecticut
and
those
that
aren't.
mr.
john
a.
dziamba
i
don't
think
so,
because
as
a
result
of
--
mr.
john
a.
dziamba
as
a
result
of
that
presumption
--
mr.
john
a.
dziamba
no,
i
still
don't
think
that's
the
question.
if
i
may
answer,
as
a
result
of
that
presumption
a
student
is
not
allowed,
an
individual
is
not
allowed
to
show
that
he
is
contributing
to
tax
basis.
mr.
john
a.
dziamba
yes,
i
think
that
maybe
the
issue,
but
i
think
that
the
reasons
the
state
says
it
needs
this
law,
and
what
it
is
trying
to
accomplish
by
having
this
law
have
to
be
taken
into
consideration.
what
they
say
is
that
the
law
allows
us
to
determine
the
student's
domiciliary
intent
and
allows
cost
equalization.
if
i
may
set
an
example.
cost
equalization
is
not
contributing
to
its
state
tax
basis,
it's
not
a
insurance
type
program.
for
instance,
in
connecticut
there
are
2000
out
of
state
students
in
the
university
of
connecticut
and
there
is
16,000
total
students.
the
total
budget
of
the
university
of
connecticut
is
between
45
and
47
million
dollars
a
year.
the
sales
tax
and
use
tax
which
are
the
primary
sources
of
income
in
the
state
of
connecticut
produce
an
annual
revenue
of
325
million
dollars
a
year.
the
gasoline
tax
produces
an
annual
revenue
of
$16
million
a
year.
the
cigarette
tax
produces
an
annual
revenue
of
$60
million
a
year.
in
a
recent
--
mr.
john
a.
dziamba
as
a
highway
tax?
mr.
john
a.
dziamba
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
john
a.
dziamba
i'm
putting
into
perspective
merely
in
showing
the
court
that
in
the
total
operating
budget,
and
in
the
amount
of
money
that
would
cost
inversely,
one
of
the
arguments
proffered
by
the
state
and
also
in
terms
of
cost
equalization,
anyone
who
is
in
connecticut,
who
is
either
driving
a
car
or
buying
merchandised
is
in
fact
contributing
to
the
cost
and
to
the
tax
basis
--
mr.
john
a.
dziamba
no,
mr.
justice
stewart.
mr.
john
a.
dziamba
no
i'm
not.
but
i
think
the
attack
is
this.
mrs.
kline
for
instance
who
is
originally
the
named
appellee
in
the
case
did
not
come
into
the
state
primarily
for
education.
it
was
incidental
and
as
a
result
of
that
incidental,
she
is
being
penalized
to
the
extent,
that
she
has
to
pay
for
the
rest
of
the
remainder
at
the
university,
she
must
pay
twice
the
tuition.
what
we're
attacking
is
that
the
state
has
the
right
to
adopt
the
differential
between
those
who
are
bona
fide
residents
and
those
who
are
not.
it's
freezing
in
that
status
that
we
say
violates
very
fundamental
constitutional
rights.
mr.
john
a.
dziamba
are
you
indicating
citizens,
bona
fide
residents?
mr.
john
a.
dziamba
i
think
that's
a
very
difficult
question
and
the
one
that
is
first
of
all
not
presented
by
the
facts
of
this
case
and
i
think
that
it
would
have
to
be
analyzed
in
terms
of
the
standards
already
set
down
by
this
court
and
that
is,
the
state
may
have
a
special
public
interest
it
wants
to
protect,
but
as
the
amicus
points
out
in
its
table
one
a
lot
of
that
money
comes
from
federal
funds
--
that
would
have
to
be
a
clear
showing,
i
think
in
the
record
first
of
all,
as
to
what
evil
the
state
is
trying
to
protect
itself
against
by
limiting
a
state
benefit
only
to
residents
of
that
state.
mr.
john
a.
dziamba
but
it's
the
determination
of
who
is
a
resident,
which
is
a
--
mr.
john
a.
dziamba
yes
sir.
mr.
john
a.
dziamba
well,
i
think
that
the
legislative
presumption
that
has
no
basis
of
fact
is
one
that
would
not
be
allowed.
mr.
john
a.
dziamba
well,
i
again
come
back
to
responding
to
mr.
justice
stewart's
question,
but
i
think
that
that
is
the
point.
i
think
that
the
statute
has
to
be
analyzed
not
only
in
what
it
said,
but
in
the
proffered
purposes.
mr.
john
a.
dziamba
well,
i
think
first
of
all,
mr.
justice
marshall,
those
are
not
the
facts
presented
in
this
case,
but
the
question
then
would
be
first
of
all
how
do
you
establish
residency?
how
can
--
mr.
john
a.
dziamba
as
a
nonresident?
mr.
john
a.
dziamba
i
think
your
honor
that
that
is
a
different
legislative
judgment
on
a
one
made
here.
the
legislative
judgment
in
here
is
that
you
do
have
a
right.
connecticut
has
not
excluded,
you
do
have
a
right,
but
you
must
pay
more.
then
i
think
is
the
issue;
connecticut
has
not
gone
that
far
and
i
would
not
attempt
to
assess
definitively
the
constitution
opinions
going
that
far.
mr.
john
a.
dziamba
i
would
not
say,
i
said
that
you'd
have
to
look
at
the
circumstances,
at
the
amount
of
discrimination
against
whom
they
were
trying
to
keep
out,
why.
the
federal
government
has
recognized
that
education
is
a
large
problem
shared
by
all
of
the
states.
i
think
these
are
all
considerations
that
this
court
has
used
in
other
types
of
situations
and
i
think
that
they
would
be
employed
to
assess
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute.
mr.
john
a.
dziamba
the
present
regulation
is
unreasonable
in
that
it
does
not
allow
change
in
status.
mr.
john
a.
dziamba
i
think
mr
chief
justice
that
--
mr.
john
a.
dziamba
i
think
mr.
chief
justice
the
question
is
how
do
you
determine
residents,
and
is
that
determination
irrational?
mr.
john
a.
dziamba
no
i
don't
concede
that.
mr.
john
a.
dziamba
no,
i
don't.
i
say
that
that
has
to
be
examined
on
a
particular
basis
in
the
record
of
connecticut
would
put
forth
why
they
need
that
particular
exclusion?
mr.
john
a.
dziamba
i
think
that
the
privileges
in
the
immunities
clause
would
prohibit
them
from
excluding
all
nonresidents
unless
they
show
--
unless
they
could
show
particular
reason
why,
and
substantiate
it
on
the
basis
in
fact
on
the
record.
i
think
the
issue
in
this
case
is
how
do
you
establish
residency,
how
do
you
define
residency,
and
is
that
a
rational
definition
of
residency,
and
then
how
do
you
establish
that
residency.
i
think
that
what
happened
in
this
case,
since
the
invalidation
of
the
statute
by
the
lower
court
is
very
instructive
and
that
is
that
connecticut
has
adopted
adequate
criteria
and
as
they
say
that
each
case
--
they
say
that
each
case
is
a
question
of
domicile,
the
present
standard
that
they
have.
now
each
case
must
be
decided
on
its
own
particular
facts
in
that
in
reviewing
a
claim
for
reclassification.
mr.
john
a.
dziamba
the
new
standard.
mr.
john
a.
dziamba
since
the
decision.
mr.
john
a.
dziamba
of
the
district
court.
mr.
john
a.
dziamba
the
attorney
general
opinion,
yes,
and
that's
a
relevant
criteria
for
determining
that
status
in-state
or
out
of
state,
resident
or
nonresident
a
or
b,
include
year
on
residents,
voter
registration,
place
of
filling
tax
returns,
property
ownership,
driver's
license,
connecticut
registration,
marital
status,
vacation
and
employment
plan
and
not
only
the
present
system,
a
student
comes
in
and
fills
out
and
affidavit,
you
may
ask
him,
what
is
your
parent's
address,
who
has
custody
of
you
if
your
parents
are
separated,
what
is
your
age,
what
is
your
address,
what
is
your
marital
status,
all
high
schools
and
colleges
that
you
have
attended
with
their
addresses,
military
service,
periods
and
other
service,
voter
registration,
driver's
license,
automobile
registration,
and
provides
that
falsification
for
this
to
be
grounds
for
expulsion.
and
i
think
mr.
justice
stewart
in
all
candor,
that
this
is
the
objective
of
the
state.
it's
not
to
say
only
for
state
residents
or
only
for
connecticut
residents
but
is
to
determine
who
is
a
bona
fide
resident
of
the
state
and
i
think
this
point
is
borne
out
by
the
appellants
on
brief
by
stating
again
that
the
reason
that
this
particular
irrebuttable
presumption
is
adopted,
is
to
allow
the
state
to
have
facility
in
determining
the
student's
domiciliary
intent
and
to
affect
some
type
of
cost
equalization
between
those
people
who
are
contributing
to
tax
basis
in
this
or
not.
out
position
is
that
there
is
no
reason
for
such
a
drastic,
irrebuttable
presumption
and
adequate
criteria
exists.
this
court
has
well
recognized
and
not
limited
merely
to
the
issues
of
voting
or
welfare
but
that
this
is
the
objective
of
the
state,
we
must
take
the
state
at
its
words
and
this
is
the
objective
of
the
state
then
it
must
pursue
rational
criteria
to
do
that.
mr.
john
a.
dziamba
yes,
when
i
think
that
those
requirements
are
unconstitutional
that
in
that
they
affect
a
penalty
on
the
right
to
travel.
i
think
that
that's
a
proper
analysis.
mr.
john
a.
dziamba
if
that
person,
excuse
me,
if
that
person
does
not
intend
to
become
a
resident
per
se,
bona
fide
nonresident,
yes.
mr.
john
a.
dziamba
a
resident.
mr.
john
a.
dziamba
then
i
think
that
the
individual
increase
and
one
that's
going
to
bring
out
this
--
mr.
john
a.
dziamba
yes.
i
think
there
is
a
restriction
on
the
right
to
travel
for
those
citizens
who
also
finds
students,
those
bona
fide
residents
of
the
state
of
connecticut.
i
think
that
a
student
who
comes
into
a
connecticut
and
says
i
don't
care
about
your
state,
i
don't
care
about
remaining
in
the
state,
i
want
the
benefit
of
the
tuition
and
therefore
i
declare
myself
a
connecticut
resident.
i
think
that
presents
a
vastly
different
--
i
think
the
right
to
travel
is
one
which
is
always
been
recently
i
would
say,
connected
with
establishing
bona
fide
domicile,
a
new
start,
a
new
life,
a
life
with
one's
husband
as
mrs.
kline
did
in
this
case.
her
husband
was
a
life
long
resident
of
the
state
of
connecticut.
mr.
john
a.
dziamba
well
i
think
--
mr.
john
a.
dziamba
and
you
don't
get
any
reduction
in
that
obligation
either.
mr.
john
a.
dziamba
well,
he
is
also
bearing
all
of
the
burdens,
in
that
is
he
doesn't
get
a
reduction
in
his
sales
and
use
tax.
mr.
john
a.
dziamba
well,
that
is
going
through
that
is
not
staying
there
and
live.
mr.
john
a.
dziamba
but
you
do
not
consider
connecticut
your
home.
mr.
john
a.
dziamba
no
i
thank
you
to
statute
is
in
firm
even
under
rational
basis
test,
given
the
proffered
purposes
by
the
state.
mr.
john
a.
dziamba
i
thought
i
covered
that
mr.
justice
marshall
by
saying
that
the
state
has
put
forth
the
reasons
why.
it
needs
this
particular
restriction.
mr.
john
a.
dziamba
the
unreasonable
point
i
think
you
said
there
is
no
way
of
establishing
residency
for
a
particular
purpose
and
i
think
that,
that
is
unreasonable
that
if
you
are
bona
fide
resident
of
state
connecticut
for
any
and
all
purposes
and
you
are
paying
all
the
benefits,
you
are
paying
all
the
burdens
of
taxation,
why
that
particular
benefit,
why
not
exclude
you
from
the
hospitals,
why
not
exclude
you
from
this
state
highways,
why
not
exclude
you
from
the
public
libraries?
i
think
the
state
has
to
show
a
rational
reason
why
they
want
to
exclude
a
bona
fide,
a
new
bona
fide
resident
from
that
particular
state
benefit
and
i
do
not
think
the
state
is
sustained
that
burden
here.
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice.
