mr.
henry
p.
sailer
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
as
mr.
friedman
has
indicated,
there
are
two
appellees
in
this
case
and
i
represent
the
appellee
glaxo
group
ltd.,
and
i
am
speaking
on
behalf
of
glaxo,
although
many
of
my
points
will
apply
to
both
the
appellees.
i
have
found
the
government's
position
on
what
i
call
the
basic
issue
in
this
case,
the
non-relief
issue
to
be
quite
illusive
from
the
beginning,
but
i
think
i
am
now
understand
what
they
are
saying
in
this
court
and
i
would
like
to
state
it
as
i
understand
it
and
then
direct
my
remarks
to
that
--
upon
then.
i
think
their
position
is
this
that
when
the
attorney
general
brings
in
ordinary
antitrust
case
to
challenge
ordinary
antitrust
restrictions
and
somewhere
in
the
picture
there
are
patents
and
i
will
get
back
to
this.
he
should
have
a
right
first
to
try
the
antitrust
suit
and
then
after
that
suit
is
determined
and
he
has
got
an
antitrust
judgment
and
got
antitrust
relief,
go
on
and
try
a
patent
suit
on
the
question
of
patent
validity
with
no
antitrust
issues,
with
nothing,
but
ordinary
patent
law
issues,
what
i
call
issues
arising
under
the
patent
for
an
invention
and
like.
now
i
understand
that
the
government
seeks
that
position
even
where
as
in
this
case
the
outcome
of
the
antitrust
suit
doesn't
depend
in
anyway
on
the
validity
or
invalidity
of
the
patents.
i
think
that's
conceded
here
and
even
whereas
here,
the
government
has
won
the
antitrust
suit
and
has
gotten
antitrust
relief.
now
the
appellees
think
that
there
is
no
more
or
less
reason
for
allowing
a
pure,
what
i
call
a
pure
ordinary
patent
suit
in
this
situation
than
there
would
be
for
allowing
the
attorney
general
to
bring
an
ordinary
patent
validity
suit
all
by
itself
whenever
he
saw
fit
to
do
so.
i
don't
understand
the
appellant
to
press
that
right
in
this
case
and
i
will
come
to
some
observations
about
that
question,
but
i
think
that
i
am
unable
to
distinguish
between
the
two
situations.
now,
appellant
has
made
some
broad
factual
as
well
as
legal
arguments
in
this
case,
but
the
adjudicated
facts
are
very
narrow
indeed
and
i
would
like
to
emphasize
them
with
the
court's
consideration.
this
case
involves
restrictions
on
the
resale,
the
resale
of
griseofulvin.
the
appellees
also
had
agreements
that
related
to
the
sale
by
patent
licensees
of
any
griseofulvin
that
they
might
manufacture,
but
those
agreements
have
not
been
challenged
by
the
government
in
this
case.
they
could
have
challenged
them,
they
chose
not
to
challenge
them.
the
government
didn't
charge
any
overall
conspiracy.
it
has
three
judgments
on
the
merits
and
each
one
is
directed
to
a
written
provision
of
a
written
contract.
in
each
case,
a
provision
that
said,
you
may
not
resale
bulk
griseofulvin,
in
bulk.
now,
there
is
no
question
whether
those
provisions
can't
be
justified
by
patents,
no
attempt
was
made
to
justify
them
by
patents.
there
are
ordinary
restraints
on
the
resale
of
the
purchased
commodity.
the
record
shows
that
when
glaxo
made
these
agreements,
it
didn't
have
any
doubt
or
question
about
its
legality.
glaxo,
the
record
shows,
is
an
english
company,
still
has
no
place
of
business
in
the
united
states.
the
provisions
i
am
talking
about
had
long
since
been
canceled.
the
ici
provision
with
its
vendee
was
canceled
more
than
five
years
ago
and
the
glaxo
provisions
were
canceled
more
than
four-and-a-half
years
ago
and
the
appellant
has
a
judgment
that
expressly
prohibits
their
revival
and
that
judgment
is
already
currently
effective.
now
in
the
trial
court,
appellant
made
that
challenge
and
they
also
sought
to
challenge
two
patents
on
the
pure
question
of
ordinary
patent
validity.
the
original
complaint
challenged
an
ici
patent
leading
to
dosage
form
griseofulvin
that
it
issued
in
1959.
and
later,
after
sometime,
appellant
sought
to
amend
their
complaint
to
challenge
the
glaxo
patent
on
griseofulvin
in
a
particular
form,
so
called
the
micro
size
or
ultra-fine
form.
now
that
patent
hadn't
even
been
the
issue
until
the
fall
of
1967,
which
was
shortly
before
the
suit
was
brought
and
very
shortly
before
the
restrictions,
the
only
restrictions
we
are
talking
about
were
terminated
and
canceled.
it
hadn't
existed
at
all
at
the
time
these
agreements
were
entered
into
or
for
years
afterwards
not
for
years.
now,
i
do
think
it's
important
to
emphasize,
although
i
think
the
court
now
has
been
made
aware
that
the
patents
weren't
challenged
because
they
--
on
the
ground
they
were
invalid
because
they
have
been
misused
or
because
they
have
been
used
to
accomplish
illegal
restraints
or
anything
like
that.
they
were
challenged
on
the
ground
that
patent
office
had
made
a
mistake
under
the
patent
law
in
issuing,
that's
the
sole
ground
for
challenge.
and
below,
i
understand
the
appellant
not
to
have
relied
on
the
antitrust
laws
and
i
invite
the
court
to
examine
the
appellant’s
main
brief
on
this
subject
below
which
begins
in
the
record
at
page
263.
they
relied
on
a
claim
inherent
power
of
the
attorney
general
to
bring
suit
to
cancel
endowed
patents.
the
trial
court
stated
the
issue
as
it
understood
it
as,
“whether
the
united
states
can
challenge
a
patent
independent
of
any
antitrust
rights,”
that's
the
way
the
trial
court
formulated
the
issue
that
it
decided
and
the
trial
court
held
that
it
could.
the
appellant
didn't
petition
to
reconsideration
and
it
didn't
suggest
to
trial
court,
didn't
suggest
the
trial
court
that
it
misunderstood
the
issue,
it
is
wrong
to
point
that
in
the
issue.
now,
the
appellant
hasn't
appealed
the
question
of
the
inherent
power
of
the
attorney
general
to
challenge
patents.
i
do
not
think
it
could
appeal
that
question
to
this
court
under
the
expediting
act,
that's
not
a
question,
it
my
judgment
that
arises
under
the
antitrust
laws.
here,
they
formulated
a
new
issue
and
i
submit
a
different
issue
which
is
they
stated
variously,
but
whether
patents
that
are
involved
in
or
essential
to
or
the
foundation
of,
or
the
keystone
of,
these
are
all
terms
they
use,
can
be
challenged
under
the
antitrust
jurisdiction
on
pure
patent
law
grounds
in
an
antitrust
case,
even
when
that
challenge
is
not
necessary
to
enable
the
government
to
reach
the
antitrust
violation,
only
antitrust
violations
of
it.
now,
in
their
reply
brief
in
this
court,
the
government
claims
that
they
did
present
this
question
that
they
now
seemed
to
present
what
i
call
the
patents
involved
in
question
to
the
trial
court.
now
as
i
read
the
record,
this
simply
isn't
correct.
the
only
material
they
cite
in
support
of
this
proposition
are
in
footnote
1
of
their
reply
brief
and
i
submit
that
those
questions
don't
raise
the
issue
meaningfully
as
the
ici
and
don't
even
raise
at
all
as
to
my
client,
glaxo.
none
of
the
government’s
papers
below
as
to
glaxo
ever
mentioned
any
alleged
involvement
of
glaxo's
patent
with
any
antitrust
violation,
but
the
government
says
here
the
questions
one
of
law
and
therefore
the
court
go
ahead
and
decide
the
question,
assuming
that
the
patent
was
indeed
involved
in
an
antitrust
violation.
i
suggest
your
honors,
that
whether
the
glaxo's
patent
was
involved
in
the
restrictions
on
resale,
we're
talking
about
in
any
sense
relevant
here,
is
not
a
question
of
law
but
a
question
of
fact.
appellant
didn't
show
below
and
it
didn't
ask
the
court
below
to
find
and
the
court
below
didn't
find
that
glaxo's
patent
was
an
essential
element
in
the
original
agreements,
indeed
it
couldn't
have
possibly
found
out
that
the
patent
didn't
even
issue
until
seven
or
eight
years
after
the
agreements
we're
talking
about
was
made.
it
didn't
ask
the
court
to
find.
the
court
didn't
find
that
the
violations
would
have
been
anymore
of
that,
did
any
different
if
glaxo
micro
size
patent
which
issued
seven
years,
eight
years
after
the
agreements
were
made
had
never
existed.
i
suggest
that
there
is
interesting
contrast
between
the
situation
here
and
that
existed
in
the
empsall
(ph)
448
f.
2nd
is
cited
in
the
appellant's
reply
brief
where
the
trial
court
was
asked
to
make
and
did
make
very
specific
and
detailed
findings
on
the
actual
involvement
of
the
patent
that
was
an
issue
in
an
independent
antitrust
violation.
mr.
henry
p.
sailer
well,
i
–
and
they
should
ask
mr.
friedman
that
question,
your
honor,
that
i
don't
know,
don't
know
what
he
does
mean
that,
but
i
suppose
my
answer
is
that
whatever
it
means,
if
it
means
anything
relevant
at
all
it
seems
it
must
mean
a
sine
qua
non
or
a
foundation
or
basis
of
the
agreement
that
is
alleged
to
violate
the
law.
otherwise
it
is
there,
there
is
such
a
patent,
i
concede
that,
but
if
it
doesn't
mean
that
i
don't
know
what
possible
relevance
involved
in
any
other
sense
would
it
have.
i
dealt
with
this
point
in
the
page
15
and
16
of
my
brief
and
i
like
the
court’s
attention
to
it.
i
just
don't
think
the
factual
predicate
for
the
agreement
or
the
issue
they
seek
to
raise
at
least
as
to
my
client
is
he
--
but
i
don't
need
to
rest
on
that
narrow,
although
dispositive
grant
as
to
my
client.
even
if
the
glaxo
patent
had
been
truly
related
to
or
involved
in
any
sense
in
the
antitrust
violation,
i
suggest
that
would
be
no
reason
to
give
the
government
a
right
to
engraft
on
this
ordinary
antitrust
case,
a
straight
patent
validity
suit
involving
no
antitrust
issues,
nothing
to
patent
issues
unless
as
in
the
gypsum
case,
it
was
necessary
to
do
so
in
order
to
reach,
in
order
to
cure
an
antitrust
violation.
that's
not
claimed
here.
the
government
doesn't
claim
that
unless
it's
permitted
to
try
to
invalidate
the
patents,
it
can't
reach
the
antitrust
violation
or
obtain
antitrust
relief.
the
only
antitrust
violation
had
been
abandoned
five
years
ago,
its
revival
has
been
enjoined.
now,
appellant
concedes
in
its
reply
brief
and
mr.
friedman
again
conceded
on
oral
argument
that
they
could
not
have
invoked
the
sherman
act
jurisdiction
they
say
solely
to
raise
the
patent
validity
issue.
but
at
the
same
time
they
wanted
to
first
try
an
antitrust
case
and
having
tried
it,
now
try
altogether
separate
and
distinct
patent
validity
case.
and
the
logic
of
that
simply
escapes
me,
that
it
seems
to
me
that
they
suggested
no
reason
why
the
party
should
now
go
through
a
pure
patent
litigation.
it
wouldn't
have
equally
existed
if
there
hadn't
been
any
antitrust
suit
in
the
first
place.
the
government
does
argue
that
invalid
patents
are
burdens
on
commerce
and
like
something
logs
and
screams
and
so
forth
but
that
kind
of
argument
simply
proves
too
much
here,
that
is
an
argument
that
will
be
equally
applicable.
mr.
henry
p.
sailer
yes.
i
want
to
make
it
perfectly
clear
mr.
justice
white
that
the
government
mistakes
our
position
and
i
think
misunderstands
our
position
in
their
reply
brief.
we
don't
have
--
take
this
latest
issue
with
the
proposition
that
in
an
appropriate
case,
the
court
in
an
antitrust
case
plainly
has
power
to
--
mr.
henry
p.
sailer
well,
i
can
readily
agree
with
your
arguendo
on
that
mr.
justice
and
say
at
the
same
time
that
under
those
circumstances
it
might
will
be
appropriate
for
a
court
to
decree
compulsory
patent
licensing
for
example.
but
here
we
are
talking
about
--
mr.
henry
p.
sailer
well,
i
have
a
hard
time
seeing
--
mr.
henry
p.
sailer
--
to
find
an
antitrust
issue
as
a
--
i
mean
a
patent
suit
as
a
remedy
if
you
will.
mr.
henry
p.
sailer
well,
i
would
say
it's
one
very,
very
long
step
behind.
mr.
henry
p.
sailer
the
government
denigrates
our
position
as
somewhat
as
relying
on
some
old
case
that
was
decided
long
time
ago,
that
is
if
i
understand
mr.
friedman’s
arguing.
now,
we
don't
simply
say,
here
is
this
case.
don't
pay
attention
whether
it
is
right
or
not.
there
it
is
on
the
books
and
therefore
we
want
you
to
follow
it.
the
bell
case
was
decided
in
1897,
75
years
ago
and
from
that
day
to
this,
the
government
has
never
claimed
the
power
until
this
case,
that
they
are
now
asserting,
the
power
to
attack
patents
even
when
that
is
not
necessary
in
order
to
serve
antitrust
and
reach
antitrust
violations.
if
that
rule
were
changed
it
would
open
up
a
whole
new
and
different
class
of
patent
litigation.
it
would
mean
the
government
could
--
there
are
provisions
in
the
patent
code
for
judicial
review
with
the
instance
of
a
disappointed
would
be
patentee.
he
may
take
the
patent
office
to
court.
congress
has
not
seemed
fit
to
turn
that
around
and
say
if
somebody
gets
a
patent
and
the
government
doesn't
think
it
should
have
issued,
they
can
go
to
court.
there
is
no
such
provision
in
the
statute.
i
suggest
that
what
the
attorney
general
is
really
asking
for
is
an
implied
general
appellate
revisionary
jurisdiction
over
the
patent.
now
i
want
to
talk
about
gypsum
for
a
minute
because
there
is
a
dispute
between
the
parties
as
to
whom
gypsum
helps
and
i
enthusiastically
agree
with
the
implication
of
mr.
justice
stewart's
question
that
gypsum
--
mr.
henry
p.
sailer
--
well,
did
i
say
so
mr.
justice,
that
very
strongly
cuts
in
our
direction.
in
the
gypsum
case,
the
government
had
sued
and
said,
“here
is
some
illegal
restraints”
and
the
defendant
said,
“those
restraints
would
be
illegal
if
we
didn't
have
patents
but
we
do
have
patents.”
the
government
wanted
to
amend
their
complaint
to
challenge
the
patents
because
without
doing
so
they
couldn't
reach
the
underlying
antitrust
violation.
and
under
that
narrow
set
of
facts
this
court
said,
if
that
were
necessary
to
challenge
the
patents
in
order
to
reach
the
antitrust
violation
the
government
should
be
allowed
to
do
it.
but
i
invite
the
court's
attention
to
what
actually
happen
in
that
case.
the
court
found
that
the
restraints
were
illegal
whether
or
not
the
patents
were
valid
or
invalid
and
made
it
perfectly
clear
in
its
view,
that
was
the
end
of
the
matter.
if
you
didn't
go
on
even
so
and
have
a
ordinary
patent
validity
suit
which
is
what
mr.
friedman
is
suggesting
here.
i
want
to
next
--
mr.
henry
p.
sailer
in
the
gypsum
case
--
mr.
henry
p.
sailer
--
they
never
had
any
litigation
about
the
validity
of
the
patents.
now,
i
want
to
say
one
word
and
only
a
word
about
this
anomaly
argument
of
the
government.
they
say
it
is
anomalous
to
allow
private
parties
to
challenge
patents
and
not
allow
the
government
to
do
so.
that's
not
our
position
at
all
but
there
are
situations
where
both
private
parties
and
the
government
can
challenge
patents.
and
if
the
government
is
infringing
a
patent
and
the
patentee
sues
in
the
court
of
claims
which
is
his
remedy,
the
government
like
anybody
else
can
defend
on
the
ground
that
the
patent
is
invalid.
the
government
could
seek
a
declaratory
judgment
action
that
a
patent
was
invalid
if
it
wanted
to
use
patent.
so,
we're
certainly
not
positing
a
situation
where
the
government
doesn't
have
the
same
rights
as
a
private
party.
we're
saying
it
has
those
rights
and
no
other
rights
unless
congress
gives
it.
the
other
situation
mentioned
was
the
misuse
situation.
now
i
point
out
a
very
major
difference
between
the
misuse
situation
of
what
we
are
talking
about
here.
when
you
would
adjudicate
patent
misuse,
you
don't
go
and
have
a
trial
about
whether
the
patent
is
valid
or
not,
whether
the
patent
should
have
been
issued,
whether
there
is
invention,
whether
there
is
prior
art,
that
sort
of
thing.
it
is
misuse
that
bars
you
from
asserting
certain
remedies
under
your
patent
for
a
certain
period
of
time,
but
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
validity
or
invalidity
of
the
patent.
mr.
henry
p.
sailer
well,
in
amidst
--
i
guess
the
answer
to
that
was
conceded
arguendo
i
suppose
mr.
justice.
it
assumes
that
i
would
suppose
because
the
question
is
implicitly
assuming
the
patent
is
valid,
how
much
will
we
limit
nevertheless
for
and
what
period
the
enforcement
of
that
patent
by
the
patentee.
now,
i
want
to
say
one
word
on
the
second
question
in
this
case,
this
question
of
really
--
as
i
pointed
out
that
the
only
restraint
challenged,
the
only
restraint
filed
in
this
case
was
one
on
the
power
of
vendees
to
resale.
now,
those
restraints
had
been
terminated
and
the
revivals
have
been
enjoined.
now,
mr.
friedman
talks
about
creating
and
restoring
and
so
forth
competition
that
it
seems
to
us
that
what
the
court
in
fashioning
a
remedy
in
this
case
had
his
eye
on
was
to
create
as
far
as
he
could,
a
market
structure,
the
conduit
would
likely
have
existed,
had
these
restraints
on
alienation
never
existed.
now,
the
government
has
made
a
very
revealing
statement
i
think
in
the
course
of
their
argument.
they
say
determination
of
restraints
is
not
likely
to
create
competition
because
the
individual
economic
interest
of
each
of
the
vendees
will
cause
those
vendees
not
to
sell
bulk
griseofulvin
to
their
competitors,
so
their
competitors
can
compete
with
them.
i
agree
with
them
and
i
suggest
that
for
that
reason,
although
none
of
us
can
know
certainly
that
the
government's
own
argument
indicates
strongly
that
there
isn't
any
rational
reason
to
believe
that
if
these
restraints
which
the
record
shows,
this
is
ici
would
routinely
put
into
all
its
patent
licensees
and
distribution
agreements.
if
these
restraints
had
never
existed,
i
suggest
there
is
no
evidence
that
schering,
johnson
&
johnson
and
american
home
products
which
were
three
appellees
and
the
only
people
bound
by
these
restrictions
would
have
been
enthusiastically
out
selling
bulk
drugs
to
their
generic
competitors,
so
their
generic
competitors
could
in
turn
go
and
undercut
them
in
the
marketplace.
and
on
this
point,
i
want
to
point
one
item
of
evidence
that
is
mentioned
at
page
29
of
my
brief
and
that
is
that
there
is
evidence
about
the
bulk
sales
practices
of
all
three
of
these
licensees
in
this
case.
that
there
was
testimony
from
johnson
&
johnson
that
it
was
not
and
never
had
been
in
the
business
of
selling
bulk
drugs
at
all.
there
was
testimony
from
schering
that
at
no
time
during
development
period
had
it
ever
resold
a
purchased
drug
in
bulk,
never,
as
any
purchased
drug
and
i
suggest
that
that
is
a
rather
strong
indication
that
there
would
be
no
reason
to
believe
that
they
would
have
been
out
selling
griseofulvin
in
bulk
absent
this
restriction.
and
american
home
products,
the
third
licensee
in
the
year
69
sold
$8,000
worth
of
bulk
drugs
out
of
total
corporate
sales
of
900
million
dollars
and
i
suggest
that
that
indicates
pretty
clearly
that
none
of
these
licensees
would
have
been
out
selling
bulk
griseofulvin
even
if
these
restraints
had
never
existed.
i
am
--
not
want
to
exceed
my
half
of
the
time
and
therefore
i
would
like
to
leave
the
question
in
relief
beyond
what
i
have
said
into
my
brief
and
thank
you
for
your
attention.
mr.
henry
p.
sailer
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
as
mr.
friedman
has
indicated,
there
are
two
appellees
in
this
case
and
i
represent
the
appellee
glaxo
group
ltd.,
and
i
am
speaking
on
behalf
of
glaxo,
although
many
of
my
points
will
apply
to
both
the
appellees.
i
have
found
the
government's
position
on
what
i
call
the
basic
issue
in
this
case,
the
non-relief
issue
to
be
quite
illusive
from
the
beginning,
but
i
think
i
am
now
understand
what
they
are
saying
in
this
court
and
i
would
like
to
state
it
as
i
understand
it
and
then
direct
my
remarks
to
that
--
upon
then.
i
think
their
position
is
this
that
when
the
attorney
general
brings
in
ordinary
antitrust
case
to
challenge
ordinary
antitrust
restrictions
and
somewhere
in
the
picture
there
are
patents
and
i
will
get
back
to
this.
he
should
have
a
right
first
to
try
the
antitrust
suit
and
then
after
that
suit
is
determined
and
he
has
got
an
antitrust
judgment
and
got
antitrust
relief,
go
on
and
try
a
patent
suit
on
the
question
of
patent
validity
with
no
antitrust
issues,
with
nothing,
but
ordinary
patent
law
issues,
what
i
call
issues
arising
under
the
patent
for
an
invention
and
like.
now
i
understand
that
the
government
seeks
that
position
even
where
as
in
this
case
the
outcome
of
the
antitrust
suit
doesn't
depend
in
anyway
on
the
validity
or
invalidity
of
the
patents.
i
think
that's
conceded
here
and
even
whereas
here,
the
government
has
won
the
antitrust
suit
and
has
gotten
antitrust
relief.
now
the
appellees
think
that
there
is
no
more
or
less
reason
for
allowing
a
pure,
what
i
call
a
pure
ordinary
patent
suit
in
this
situation
than
there
would
be
for
allowing
the
attorney
general
to
bring
an
ordinary
patent
validity
suit
all
by
itself
whenever
he
saw
fit
to
do
so.
i
don't
understand
the
appellant
to
press
that
right
in
this
case
and
i
will
come
to
some
observations
about
that
question,
but
i
think
that
i
am
unable
to
distinguish
between
the
two
situations.
now,
appellant
has
made
some
broad
factual
as
well
as
legal
arguments
in
this
case,
but
the
adjudicated
facts
are
very
narrow
indeed
and
i
would
like
to
emphasize
them
with
the
court's
consideration.
this
case
involves
restrictions
on
the
resale,
the
resale
of
griseofulvin.
the
appellees
also
had
agreements
that
related
to
the
sale
by
patent
licensees
of
any
griseofulvin
that
they
might
manufacture,
but
those
agreements
have
not
been
challenged
by
the
government
in
this
case.
they
could
have
challenged
them,
they
chose
not
to
challenge
them.
the
government
didn't
charge
any
overall
conspiracy.
it
has
three
judgments
on
the
merits
and
each
one
is
directed
to
a
written
provision
of
a
written
contract.
in
each
case,
a
provision
that
said,
you
may
not
resale
bulk
griseofulvin,
in
bulk.
now,
there
is
no
question
whether
those
provisions
can't
be
justified
by
patents,
no
attempt
was
made
to
justify
them
by
patents.
there
are
ordinary
restraints
on
the
resale
of
the
purchased
commodity.
the
record
shows
that
when
glaxo
made
these
agreements,
it
didn't
have
any
doubt
or
question
about
its
legality.
glaxo,
the
record
shows,
is
an
english
company,
still
has
no
place
of
business
in
the
united
states.
the
provisions
i
am
talking
about
had
long
since
been
canceled.
the
ici
provision
with
its
vendee
was
canceled
more
than
five
years
ago
and
the
glaxo
provisions
were
canceled
more
than
four-and-a-half
years
ago
and
the
appellant
has
a
judgment
that
expressly
prohibits
their
revival
and
that
judgment
is
already
currently
effective.
now
in
the
trial
court,
appellant
made
that
challenge
and
they
also
sought
to
challenge
two
patents
on
the
pure
question
of
ordinary
patent
validity.
the
original
complaint
challenged
an
ici
patent
leading
to
dosage
form
griseofulvin
that
it
issued
in
1959.
and
later,
after
sometime,
appellant
sought
to
amend
their
complaint
to
challenge
the
glaxo
patent
on
griseofulvin
in
a
particular
form,
so
called
the
micro
size
or
ultra-fine
form.
now
that
patent
hadn't
even
been
the
issue
until
the
fall
of
1967,
which
was
shortly
before
the
suit
was
brought
and
very
shortly
before
the
restrictions,
the
only
restrictions
we
are
talking
about
were
terminated
and
canceled.
it
hadn't
existed
at
all
at
the
time
these
agreements
were
entered
into
or
for
years
afterwards
not
for
years.
now,
i
do
think
it's
important
to
emphasize,
although
i
think
the
court
now
has
been
made
aware
that
the
patents
weren't
challenged
because
they
--
on
the
ground
they
were
invalid
because
they
have
been
misused
or
because
they
have
been
used
to
accomplish
illegal
restraints
or
anything
like
that.
they
were
challenged
on
the
ground
that
patent
office
had
made
a
mistake
under
the
patent
law
in
issuing,
that's
the
sole
ground
for
challenge.
and
below,
i
understand
the
appellant
not
to
have
relied
on
the
antitrust
laws
and
i
invite
the
court
to
examine
the
appellant’s
main
brief
on
this
subject
below
which
begins
in
the
record
at
page
263.
they
relied
on
a
claim
inherent
power
of
the
attorney
general
to
bring
suit
to
cancel
endowed
patents.
the
trial
court
stated
the
issue
as
it
understood
it
as,
“whether
the
united
states
can
challenge
a
patent
independent
of
any
antitrust
rights,”
that's
the
way
the
trial
court
formulated
the
issue
that
it
decided
and
the
trial
court
held
that
it
could.
the
appellant
didn't
petition
to
reconsideration
and
it
didn't
suggest
to
trial
court,
didn't
suggest
the
trial
court
that
it
misunderstood
the
issue,
it
is
wrong
to
point
that
in
the
issue.
now,
the
appellant
hasn't
appealed
the
question
of
the
inherent
power
of
the
attorney
general
to
challenge
patents.
i
do
not
think
it
could
appeal
that
question
to
this
court
under
the
expediting
act,
that's
not
a
question,
it
my
judgment
that
arises
under
the
antitrust
laws.
here,
they
formulated
a
new
issue
and
i
submit
a
different
issue
which
is
they
stated
variously,
but
whether
patents
that
are
involved
in
or
essential
to
or
the
foundation
of,
or
the
keystone
of,
these
are
all
terms
they
use,
can
be
challenged
under
the
antitrust
jurisdiction
on
pure
patent
law
grounds
in
an
antitrust
case,
even
when
that
challenge
is
not
necessary
to
enable
the
government
to
reach
the
antitrust
violation,
only
antitrust
violations
of
it.
now,
in
their
reply
brief
in
this
court,
the
government
claims
that
they
did
present
this
question
that
they
now
seemed
to
present
what
i
call
the
patents
involved
in
question
to
the
trial
court.
now
as
i
read
the
record,
this
simply
isn't
correct.
the
only
material
they
cite
in
support
of
this
proposition
are
in
footnote
1
of
their
reply
brief
and
i
submit
that
those
questions
don't
raise
the
issue
meaningfully
as
the
ici
and
don't
even
raise
at
all
as
to
my
client,
glaxo.
none
of
the
government’s
papers
below
as
to
glaxo
ever
mentioned
any
alleged
involvement
of
glaxo's
patent
with
any
antitrust
violation,
but
the
government
says
here
the
questions
one
of
law
and
therefore
the
court
go
ahead
and
decide
the
question,
assuming
that
the
patent
was
indeed
involved
in
an
antitrust
violation.
i
suggest
your
honors,
that
whether
the
glaxo's
patent
was
involved
in
the
restrictions
on
resale,
we're
talking
about
in
any
sense
relevant
here,
is
not
a
question
of
law
but
a
question
of
fact.
appellant
didn't
show
below
and
it
didn't
ask
the
court
below
to
find
and
the
court
below
didn't
find
that
glaxo's
patent
was
an
essential
element
in
the
original
agreements,
indeed
it
couldn't
have
possibly
found
out
that
the
patent
didn't
even
issue
until
seven
or
eight
years
after
the
agreements
we're
talking
about
was
made.
it
didn't
ask
the
court
to
find.
the
court
didn't
find
that
the
violations
would
have
been
anymore
of
that,
did
any
different
if
glaxo
micro
size
patent
which
issued
seven
years,
eight
years
after
the
agreements
were
made
had
never
existed.
i
suggest
that
there
is
interesting
contrast
between
the
situation
here
and
that
existed
in
the
empsall
(ph)
448
f.
2nd
is
cited
in
the
appellant's
reply
brief
where
the
trial
court
was
asked
to
make
and
did
make
very
specific
and
detailed
findings
on
the
actual
involvement
of
the
patent
that
was
an
issue
in
an
independent
antitrust
violation.
mr.
henry
p.
sailer
well,
i
–
and
they
should
ask
mr.
friedman
that
question,
your
honor,
that
i
don't
know,
don't
know
what
he
does
mean
that,
but
i
suppose
my
answer
is
that
whatever
it
means,
if
it
means
anything
relevant
at
all
it
seems
it
must
mean
a
sine
qua
non
or
a
foundation
or
basis
of
the
agreement
that
is
alleged
to
violate
the
law.
otherwise
it
is
there,
there
is
such
a
patent,
i
concede
that,
but
if
it
doesn't
mean
that
i
don't
know
what
possible
relevance
involved
in
any
other
sense
would
it
have.
i
dealt
with
this
point
in
the
page
15
and
16
of
my
brief
and
i
like
the
court’s
attention
to
it.
i
just
don't
think
the
factual
predicate
for
the
agreement
or
the
issue
they
seek
to
raise
at
least
as
to
my
client
is
he
--
but
i
don't
need
to
rest
on
that
narrow,
although
dispositive
grant
as
to
my
client.
even
if
the
glaxo
patent
had
been
truly
related
to
or
involved
in
any
sense
in
the
antitrust
violation,
i
suggest
that
would
be
no
reason
to
give
the
government
a
right
to
engraft
on
this
ordinary
antitrust
case,
a
straight
patent
validity
suit
involving
no
antitrust
issues,
nothing
to
patent
issues
unless
as
in
the
gypsum
case,
it
was
necessary
to
do
so
in
order
to
reach,
in
order
to
cure
an
antitrust
violation.
that's
not
claimed
here.
the
government
doesn't
claim
that
unless
it's
permitted
to
try
to
invalidate
the
patents,
it
can't
reach
the
antitrust
violation
or
obtain
antitrust
relief.
the
only
antitrust
violation
had
been
abandoned
five
years
ago,
its
revival
has
been
enjoined.
now,
appellant
concedes
in
its
reply
brief
and
mr.
friedman
again
conceded
on
oral
argument
that
they
could
not
have
invoked
the
sherman
act
jurisdiction
they
say
solely
to
raise
the
patent
validity
issue.
but
at
the
same
time
they
wanted
to
first
try
an
antitrust
case
and
having
tried
it,
now
try
altogether
separate
and
distinct
patent
validity
case.
and
the
logic
of
that
simply
escapes
me,
that
it
seems
to
me
that
they
suggested
no
reason
why
the
party
should
now
go
through
a
pure
patent
litigation.
it
wouldn't
have
equally
existed
if
there
hadn't
been
any
antitrust
suit
in
the
first
place.
the
government
does
argue
that
invalid
patents
are
burdens
on
commerce
and
like
something
logs
and
screams
and
so
forth
but
that
kind
of
argument
simply
proves
too
much
here,
that
is
an
argument
that
will
be
equally
applicable.
mr.
henry
p.
sailer
yes.
i
want
to
make
it
perfectly
clear
mr.
justice
white
that
the
government
mistakes
our
position
and
i
think
misunderstands
our
position
in
their
reply
brief.
we
don't
have
--
take
this
latest
issue
with
the
proposition
that
in
an
appropriate
case,
the
court
in
an
antitrust
case
plainly
has
power
to
--
mr.
henry
p.
sailer
well,
i
can
readily
agree
with
your
arguendo
on
that
mr.
justice
and
say
at
the
same
time
that
under
those
circumstances
it
might
will
be
appropriate
for
a
court
to
decree
compulsory
patent
licensing
for
example.
but
here
we
are
talking
about
--
mr.
henry
p.
sailer
well,
i
have
a
hard
time
seeing
--
mr.
henry
p.
sailer
--
to
find
an
antitrust
issue
as
a
--
i
mean
a
patent
suit
as
a
remedy
if
you
will.
mr.
henry
p.
sailer
well,
i
would
say
it's
one
very,
very
long
step
behind.
mr.
henry
p.
sailer
the
government
denigrates
our
position
as
somewhat
as
relying
on
some
old
case
that
was
decided
long
time
ago,
that
is
if
i
understand
mr.
friedman’s
arguing.
now,
we
don't
simply
say,
here
is
this
case.
don't
pay
attention
whether
it
is
right
or
not.
there
it
is
on
the
books
and
therefore
we
want
you
to
follow
it.
the
bell
case
was
decided
in
1897,
75
years
ago
and
from
that
day
to
this,
the
government
has
never
claimed
the
power
until
this
case,
that
they
are
now
asserting,
the
power
to
attack
patents
even
when
that
is
not
necessary
in
order
to
serve
antitrust
and
reach
antitrust
violations.
if
that
rule
were
changed
it
would
open
up
a
whole
new
and
different
class
of
patent
litigation.
it
would
mean
the
government
could
--
there
are
provisions
in
the
patent
code
for
judicial
review
with
the
instance
of
a
disappointed
would
be
patentee.
he
may
take
the
patent
office
to
court.
congress
has
not
seemed
fit
to
turn
that
around
and
say
if
somebody
gets
a
patent
and
the
government
doesn't
think
it
should
have
issued,
they
can
go
to
court.
there
is
no
such
provision
in
the
statute.
i
suggest
that
what
the
attorney
general
is
really
asking
for
is
an
implied
general
appellate
revisionary
jurisdiction
over
the
patent.
now
i
want
to
talk
about
gypsum
for
a
minute
because
there
is
a
dispute
between
the
parties
as
to
whom
gypsum
helps
and
i
enthusiastically
agree
with
the
implication
of
mr.
justice
stewart's
question
that
gypsum
--
mr.
henry
p.
sailer
--
well,
did
i
say
so
mr.
justice,
that
very
strongly
cuts
in
our
direction.
in
the
gypsum
case,
the
government
had
sued
and
said,
“here
is
some
illegal
restraints”
and
the
defendant
said,
“those
restraints
would
be
illegal
if
we
didn't
have
patents
but
we
do
have
patents.”
the
government
wanted
to
amend
their
complaint
to
challenge
the
patents
because
without
doing
so
they
couldn't
reach
the
underlying
antitrust
violation.
and
under
that
narrow
set
of
facts
this
court
said,
if
that
were
necessary
to
challenge
the
patents
in
order
to
reach
the
antitrust
violation
the
government
should
be
allowed
to
do
it.
but
i
invite
the
court's
attention
to
what
actually
happen
in
that
case.
the
court
found
that
the
restraints
were
illegal
whether
or
not
the
patents
were
valid
or
invalid
and
made
it
perfectly
clear
in
its
view,
that
was
the
end
of
the
matter.
if
you
didn't
go
on
even
so
and
have
a
ordinary
patent
validity
suit
which
is
what
mr.
friedman
is
suggesting
here.
i
want
to
next
--
mr.
henry
p.
sailer
in
the
gypsum
case
--
mr.
henry
p.
sailer
--
they
never
had
any
litigation
about
the
validity
of
the
patents.
now,
i
want
to
say
one
word
and
only
a
word
about
this
anomaly
argument
of
the
government.
they
say
it
is
anomalous
to
allow
private
parties
to
challenge
patents
and
not
allow
the
government
to
do
so.
that's
not
our
position
at
all
but
there
are
situations
where
both
private
parties
and
the
government
can
challenge
patents.
and
if
the
government
is
infringing
a
patent
and
the
patentee
sues
in
the
court
of
claims
which
is
his
remedy,
the
government
like
anybody
else
can
defend
on
the
ground
that
the
patent
is
invalid.
the
government
could
seek
a
declaratory
judgment
action
that
a
patent
was
invalid
if
it
wanted
to
use
patent.
so,
we're
certainly
not
positing
a
situation
where
the
government
doesn't
have
the
same
rights
as
a
private
party.
we're
saying
it
has
those
rights
and
no
other
rights
unless
congress
gives
it.
the
other
situation
mentioned
was
the
misuse
situation.
now
i
point
out
a
very
major
difference
between
the
misuse
situation
of
what
we
are
talking
about
here.
when
you
would
adjudicate
patent
misuse,
you
don't
go
and
have
a
trial
about
whether
the
patent
is
valid
or
not,
whether
the
patent
should
have
been
issued,
whether
there
is
invention,
whether
there
is
prior
art,
that
sort
of
thing.
it
is
misuse
that
bars
you
from
asserting
certain
remedies
under
your
patent
for
a
certain
period
of
time,
but
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
validity
or
invalidity
of
the
patent.
mr.
henry
p.
sailer
well,
in
amidst
--
i
guess
the
answer
to
that
was
conceded
arguendo
i
suppose
mr.
justice.
it
assumes
that
i
would
suppose
because
the
question
is
implicitly
assuming
the
patent
is
valid,
how
much
will
we
limit
nevertheless
for
and
what
period
the
enforcement
of
that
patent
by
the
patentee.
now,
i
want
to
say
one
word
on
the
second
question
in
this
case,
this
question
of
really
--
as
i
pointed
out
that
the
only
restraint
challenged,
the
only
restraint
filed
in
this
case
was
one
on
the
power
of
vendees
to
resale.
now,
those
restraints
had
been
terminated
and
the
revivals
have
been
enjoined.
now,
mr.
friedman
talks
about
creating
and
restoring
and
so
forth
competition
that
it
seems
to
us
that
what
the
court
in
fashioning
a
remedy
in
this
case
had
his
eye
on
was
to
create
as
far
as
he
could,
a
market
structure,
the
conduit
would
likely
have
existed,
had
these
restraints
on
alienation
never
existed.
now,
the
government
has
made
a
very
revealing
statement
i
think
in
the
course
of
their
argument.
they
say
determination
of
restraints
is
not
likely
to
create
competition
because
the
individual
economic
interest
of
each
of
the
vendees
will
cause
those
vendees
not
to
sell
bulk
griseofulvin
to
their
competitors,
so
their
competitors
can
compete
with
them.
i
agree
with
them
and
i
suggest
that
for
that
reason,
although
none
of
us
can
know
certainly
that
the
government's
own
argument
indicates
strongly
that
there
isn't
any
rational
reason
to
believe
that
if
these
restraints
which
the
record
shows,
this
is
ici
would
routinely
put
into
all
its
patent
licensees
and
distribution
agreements.
if
these
restraints
had
never
existed,
i
suggest
there
is
no
evidence
that
schering,
johnson
&
johnson
and
american
home
products
which
were
three
appellees
and
the
only
people
bound
by
these
restrictions
would
have
been
enthusiastically
out
selling
bulk
drugs
to
their
generic
competitors,
so
their
generic
competitors
could
in
turn
go
and
undercut
them
in
the
marketplace.
and
on
this
point,
i
want
to
point
one
item
of
evidence
that
is
mentioned
at
page
29
of
my
brief
and
that
is
that
there
is
evidence
about
the
bulk
sales
practices
of
all
three
of
these
licensees
in
this
case.
that
there
was
testimony
from
johnson
&
johnson
that
it
was
not
and
never
had
been
in
the
business
of
selling
bulk
drugs
at
all.
there
was
testimony
from
schering
that
at
no
time
during
development
period
had
it
ever
resold
a
purchased
drug
in
bulk,
never,
as
any
purchased
drug
and
i
suggest
that
that
is
a
rather
strong
indication
that
there
would
be
no
reason
to
believe
that
they
would
have
been
out
selling
griseofulvin
in
bulk
absent
this
restriction.
and
american
home
products,
the
third
licensee
in
the
year
69
sold
$8,000
worth
of
bulk
drugs
out
of
total
corporate
sales
of
900
million
dollars
and
i
suggest
that
that
indicates
pretty
clearly
that
none
of
these
licensees
would
have
been
out
selling
bulk
griseofulvin
even
if
these
restraints
had
never
existed.
i
am
--
not
want
to
exceed
my
half
of
the
time
and
therefore
i
would
like
to
leave
the
question
in
relief
beyond
what
i
have
said
into
my
brief
and
thank
you
for
your
attention.
