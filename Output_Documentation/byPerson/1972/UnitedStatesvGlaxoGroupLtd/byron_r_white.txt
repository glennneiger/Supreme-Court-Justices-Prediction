justice
byron
r.
white
now,
this
was
in
the
complaint?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
why
in
the
complaint
did
the
government
challenged
the
validity
of
the
patent?
justice
byron
r.
white
this
was
perhaps
an
anticipation
that
they
are
relying
on
the
patent
to
justify
the
restriction
or
what?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
if
the
licensee
were
sued
by
the
patentee
here
who
enforces
the
license
agreement?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
the
licensee
could
answer
as
hey
will--
by
the
way
your
patents
indulged?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
if
it
it
were
then?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
how
about
trouble
damages?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
then
on
--
would
say
it
appears
on
the
face
of
the
license
agreement?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
very
implication
of
it
is
that
to
adopt
a
condition
against
bulk
sales
that
would
have
been
the
license
or
you
just
--
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know
it
was
but
i
thought
it
was
negotiated.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
that’s
because
without
the
patent,
the
case
on
one
side
of
the
other
falls?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
in
this
case
whether
or
not
the
patent
is
valid
doesn’t
determine
your
case
in
terms
of
whether
there
is
an
antitrust
violation?
you
do
not
need
to
hold
the
patent
invalid
to
argue
that
there
was
a
per
se
violations
of
the
antitrust
laws?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
is
it
the
jurisdictional
question
--
is
it
the
pendent
jurisdiction
question?
is
the
issue
just
--
does
the
court
have
independent
jurisdiction
to
consider
this
question
or
is
it
pendent
to
the
antitrust
issue?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
absence
a
separate
antitrust
claim,
would
you
say
there
is
jurisdiction?
justice
byron
r.
white
logically,
your
position
would
be
that
there
was
under
the
sherman
act,
logically,
you
would
say
that
it
was
an
antitrust
--
if
there
is
an
invalid
patent
being
practiced?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
just
want
to
tip
your
tongue
is
there
some
other
section
that
the
(inaudible)
patent?
justice
byron
r.
white
an
act
regulating
commerce
or
what?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
you
might
argue
that
if
an
antitrust
violation
is
achieved
through
the
mechanisms
of
the
patent,
that
it
gave
the
patentee
such
a
leverage
that
he
could
achieve
certain
restraints
of
trade
that
he
might
not
otherwise
achieve,
that
if
they
could
argue
it
just
as
the
matter
of
remedy?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
you
find
in
a
license
agreement
a
condition
that
you
won't
sell
a
territorial
restriction
or
a
customer
restriction
and
instead
of
patent
agreement.
you
wouldn't
think
--
there
isn't
so
unreasonable
thing
that
the
licensee
is
agreeing
to
that
limitation
of
his
market
only
because
he
is
on
the
hook,
he
wants
that
patent,
use
that
patent?
justice
byron
r.
white
even
there
it
wouldn't
be
fully
irrational
to
say
that
as
a
matter
of
remedy
they
ought
to
get
rid
of
the
power
that
was
the
fulcrum
for
this
violation?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
do
agree
--
justice
byron
r.
white
i
agree
with
you,
it
would
be
very
arguable
remedy,
but
nevertheless
it's
always
one
step
beyond
the
compulsory
licensing?
justice
byron
r.
white
how
about
it
--
justice
byron
r.
white
and
they
--
more
recently
in
a
suit
to
royalties?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
assume
a
patentee
sues
(inaudible)
unpaid
royalties,
and
the
licensee
says
i
(inaudible)
the
patent
is
out
--
justice
byron
r.
white
they
think
this
was
predicated
on
to
some
other
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
if
the
government
says
that
it
alleges
there
has
been
tying
--
there
is
a
tying
agreement
in
existence
here
it
is
right
on
the
piece
of
paper.
and
the
engine
of
this
tying
arrangement
is
the
patent,
the
patent
leverage,
(inaudible)
the
patent.
it's
being
used
to
enforce,
to
secure
and
enforce
this
tying
arrangement.
and
the
government
says,
we
think
the
patent
is
invalid
and
should
be
declared
invalid
as
to
eliminate
this
power?
justice
byron
r.
white
they
also
held
patent.
justice
byron
r.
white
was
the
pooling
dissolved
in
this
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
if
it
hadn't
been?
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
a
question
of
remedy
then?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
so
it
would
be
a
question
of
remedy
of
they
said
not
only
that
but
we
think
that
the
patent
should
be
invalidated.
you
could
say
that
it's
a
bad
remedy
but
in
terms
of
--
but
it's
still
is
a
remedy
question?
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
this
was
in
the
complaint?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
why
in
the
complaint
did
the
government
challenged
the
validity
of

justice

this

perhaps
