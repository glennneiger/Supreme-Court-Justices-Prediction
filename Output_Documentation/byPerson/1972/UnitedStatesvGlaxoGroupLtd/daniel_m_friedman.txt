mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
well,
this
is
a
government
civil
antitrust
case,
here
on
direct
appeal
to
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
district
of
columbia,
which
presents
two
basically
unrelated
issues.
the
first
issue
is
whether
in
a
civil
antitrust
case,
the
government
may
challenge
validity
of
patents
which
although
not
relied
upon
by
the
defendants
as
a
defense
to
the
antitrust
charge
and
nevertheless
involved
in
the
antitrust
violations
case.
and
the
second
issue
is
whether
the
relief
given
by
the
district
court
in
this
case
was
inadequate.
the
appellees,
the
glaxo
group
ltd.
and
imperial
chemical
industries
inc,
which
i
should
refer
to
as
ici,
are
two
british
drug
firms.
the
drug
involved
in
this
case
is
an
antibiotic
called
griseofulvin.
griseofulvin
itself
is
an
old
product
and
is
unpatented
and
for
many
years
was
used
as
fungicide
in
the
treatment
of
fungus
infection
of
plants.
in
the
1950s,
ici
discovered
that
if
griseofulvin
was
taken
internally,
it
would
be
able
to
cure
various
fungus
infections
such
as
ringworms
on
the
skin
of
people
and
animals.
and
as
a
result
of
these
discoveries,
in
1959,
ici
obtained
a
patent
upon
this
new
use
of
the
drug.
the
patent
contained
two
basic
claims.
the
first
was
a
so-called
method
claim
which
consisted
of
a
method
of
curing
external
fungus
infections
of
animals
and
people
by
the
administration
of
what
they
describe
as
an
effective
amount
of
griseofulvin.
the
second
claim
was
a
so-called
product
claim.
it
was
described
as
pill,
a
capsule
or
a
container
containing
an
effective
amount
of
griseofulvin
which
would
accomplish
this
objective.
and
this
is
the
basic
patent,
these
two
claims
which
the
government
is
here
challenging.
in
1967,
the
other
appellee
glaxo
obtained
a
united
states
patent
on
an
improved
form
of
griseofulvin,
the
so-called
micro
size
form
of
the
drug,
which
is
very
much
ground
up
in
very
small
particles
which
is
proven
to
be
much
more
effective
than
the
original
form,
which
is
the
one
now
of
principal
commercial
significance.
between
1957
and
1960,
the
two
appellees
had
extensive
discussions,
looking
to
a
pooling
of
their
patents
and
cross-licensing,
and
in
1960,
they
reach
such
an
agreement
under
which
the
patents
on
griseofulvin
of
the
two
companies
were
pooled
and
they
cross-licensed
each
other.
and
in
addition
to
that,
in
this
agreement,
ici
agreed
that
it
would
use
its
best
endeavors
to
make
sure
that
its
licensees
did
not
sell
griseofulvin
in
bulk
to
third
persons
without
the
consent
of
glaxo.
in
1962,
ici
appointed
the
american
home
products
corporation,
an
american
firm
as
its
exclusive
distributor
of
griseofulvin.
it
previously
had
appointed
this
firm
as
its
exclusive
distributor
for
other
drugs.
and
in
its
license
to
american
home
products,
it
required
an
agreement
that
american
home
products
in
turn
would
not
sell
this
drug
in
bulk
to
any
third
persons
without
the
written
permission
of
ici.
shortly
before
this,
glaxo
had
granted
similar,
made
a
similar
agreement
with
two
other
american
firms,
schering
corporation
and
johnson
&
johnson,
appointing
them
as
distributors
for
the
drug
griseofulvin
in
the
united
states
and
the
agreements
of
glaxo
with
these
two
licensees
similarly
provide
that
the
licensees
could
not
sell
in
bulk
without
the
written
approval
of
the
licensor.
each
of
these
agreements
gave
the
people
cross-licenses
under
the
patents.
that
is
glaxo
license
under
its
own
and
ici’s
patents,
ici
license
under
its
and
the
glaxo
patent,
and
each
of
these
was
in
form,
the
form
of
a
patent
licensing
agreement.
that
is
they
--
in
addition
to
the
bulk
sales
restriction,
the
basic
agreement
was
they
licensed
them
to
manufacture
and
sell
under
the
patents
and
each
of
the
licensees
was
required
to
pay
a
royalty
to
the
licensor
based
upon
the
total
amount
of
the
griseofulvin
which
they
purchased
from
the
english
firms
and
sold.
now,
although
the
license
has
permitted
the
american
firms
to
manufacture,
the
fact
is
that
throughout
this
entire
period,
all
three
of
the
american
licensees
purchased
all
of
their
griseofulvin
from
the
english
firms.
during
this
entire
period,
neither
glaxo
nor
ici
made
any
bulk
sales
to
anyone,
other
than
the
three
licensees
and
the
three
licensees
themselves
made
no
bulk
sales
at
all
to
anyone
in
the
united
states.
shortly
before
this
suit
was
filed
when
the
appellees
were
informed
that
the
justice
department
was
investigating
the
legality
of
these
bulk
sales
restrictions,
they
canceled
them.
since
that
time,
american
home
products
corporation
has
made
a
few
sales
of
the
griseofulvin,
not
in
bulk,
but
in
the
capsule
form.
now
when
this
government
suit
was
filed
in
march
1968,
the
three
licensees
together
had
a
100%
of
the
market
and
at
the
time
the
record
was
closed
a
couple
of
years
later
they
had
98.5%
of
the
market.
the
government
suit
alleged
that
the
bulk
sales
limitations
contained
in
the
licenses
and
also
in
the
ici,
glaxo
patent
pooling
arrangement
violated
section
1
of
the
sherman
act.
the
government
complaint
also
challenged
the
ici
patent
on
two
grounds.
we
contended
that
the
method
patent
was
invalid,
because
it
did
not
disclose
how
to
practice
the
invention,
since
it’s
nowhere
stated
what
was
an
effective
amount
of
griseofulvin,
and
of
course,
the
patent,
the
idea
that
was
patented
was
the
administration
of
an
effective
amount
necessary
to
cure
these
diseases.
as
we
said,
all
that
it
said
was
an
effective
amount
and
that
didn’t
sufficiently
disclose
the
method
of
practice
in
the
invention
so
that
when
the
patent
ultimately
expires,
this
patented
information
will
be
available
to
the
public.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
this
was
in
the
complaint,
mr.
justice.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
we
didn’t
spell
out
in
the
compliant
but
we
said
that
these
patents
were
invalid
and
the
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no
they
have
not
relied
on
the
patent.
no,
our
basic
theory
mr.
justice
white
is
that
we
have
the
right
in
an
antitrust
case
where
we
allege
and
claim
that
the
patents
were
involved
in
the
violation,
we
have
the
right
as
an
incident
to
that
antitrust
suit
to
challenge
the
violation.
of
course,
here
our
allegation
is
that
these
bulk
sales
agreements
restrictions
were
invalid
and
these
of
course
will
brought
the
patent
licensing
agreements.
now
we
also
challenged
the
so-called
product
claim
on
the
ground
that
all
this
was,
was
a
new
use
of
the
well-known
product
and
if
you
couldn’t
get
a
product
claim
on
that
that
could
only
be
patented
under
the
method
claim.
though
it
is
not
in
this
case
a
trial
in
the
traditional
sense,
the
case
was
decided
on
various
motions
for
partial
summary
judgment.
however,
an
extensive
record
was
produced,
it
occupies
400
pages
in
this
court
and
extensive
facts
were
developed
through
affidavits,
through
depositions,
through
stipulations,
through
various
documents.
the
district
court
held
that
the
ban
upon
the
sales
of
bulk
of
the
griseofulvin
and
both
the
patent
licensing
agreements
and
the
cross-licensing
agreements
was
per
se
violation
of
section
one
of
the
sherman
act,
because
under
this
court’s
decision
in
the
schwinn
case
in
388
u.s.
it
was
an
impermissible
restraint
by
the
manufacture
upon
alienation.
that
is
the
manufacturer
(inaudible)
or
is
tighten
and
control
over
the
property
when
he
sold
it
to
the
american
licensees
and
he
could
not
thereafter
control
the
disposition
made
by
the
american
licensees.
the
district
court
however,
struck
from
the
complaint
the
allegations
with
respect
to
the
invalidity
of
the
patents.
the
court
said
that
the
government
had
no
standing
to
litigate
this
issue
and
there
were
two
grounds
of
its
decision
--
it’s
really
one
ground.
what
it
said
was
as
it
interpreted
the
prior
decisions
of
this
court,
the
government
may
challenge
the
validity
of
a
patent
only
in
two
circumstances.
one,
where
it
is
alleged
the
patent
has
been
obtained
by
fraud
on
the
patent
office.
there
was
no
such
claim
here.
two,
where
the
defendants
rely
upon
the
patent
as
a
defense
to
the
antitrust
case,
and
since
the
defendants
here,
the
expressed
it,
one
of
the
ici
had
disavowed
the
reliance
on
the
patent
is
concluded
that
the
government
had
no
standing
and
consistent
with
that
decision,
it
also
denied
the
government’s
motion
to
file
an
amended
complaint,
which
among,
other
things,
would
have
also
challenged
the
validity
of
the
later
glaxo
patent.
the
judgment
the
district
court
entered
in
this
case
prohibits
the
appellees
from
participating,
adhering,
enforcing
it
anyway,
agreement
prohibiting
or
limiting
the
resale
in
bulk
of
not
only
griseofulvin
but
of
all
drugs
that
it
sells
in
the
united
states.
the
district
court
however
refused
to
grant
two
other
provisions
which
the
government
asserted
was
essential
to
dissipate
the
effects
of
this
illegal
conduct.
that
is,
we
said
in
addition
to
that
the
court
should
order
the
appellees
themselves
to
grant
licenses
in
bulk
as
long
as
they
sell
in
the
united
states
on
reasonable,
nondiscriminatory
terms
and
in
addition
we
urge
that
they
should
be
required
to
grant
licenses
under
their
patents
at
reasonable
royalties.
and
i
will
discus
the
facts
relating
to
the
need
for
this
relief
when
i
come
to
discus
the
relief
portions
of
the
case.
now,
under
this
court’s
decision
in
the
gypsum
case,
there
is
no
question
that
if
the
defendants
rely
upon
a
patent
as
a
defense
to
a
antitrust
case
involving
patents,
the
government
then
has
standing
to
challenge
the
patents.
in
the
gypsum
case,
what
happened
was
the
government
alleged
that
an
industry
wide
price-fixing
system
resulting
from
the
series
of
patent
licenses
violated
the
sherman
act.
the
defendants
in
that
case
admitted
that
if
their
patents
didn’t
provide
a
defense,
their
conduct
was
illegal.
but
they
asserted
the
patents
did
provide
a
defense.
at
that
point,
the
government
then
moved
to
amend
the
complaint
to
challenge
the
validity
of
the
patents.
the
district
court
refused
to
permit
the
government
to
do
that,
saying
that
if
you
permitted
the
government
in
an
antitrust
suit
to
challenge
the
validity
of
patents
that
would
involve
a
collateral
attack
upon
the
decision
of
commissioner
of
patents
granting
a
patent,
and
that
the
statute
do
not
permit
such
collateral
attack.
when
the
case
came
to
this
court
on
the
government’s
appeal,
the
court
said
it
was
actually
unnecessary
to
decide
that
issue
because
it
concluded
that
what
the
defendants
had
done
in
that
case
could
not
be
justified
by
their
patents.
but
it
said
that
because
of
the
significance
of
the
issue
was
unwise
to
leave
that
holding
as
a
precedent,
and
therefore
took
pains
to
correct.
and
i
would
like
to
read
to
the
court
the
ground
on
which
this
court
held
that
the
district
court
had
erred
in
gypsum
in
saying
that
government
couldn’t
rely
on
the
patents.
it’s
in
333
u.s.
of
pages
387-388.
the
court
said,
“in
an
antitrust
suit,
instituted
by
a
licensee
against
his
licensor,
we
have
repeatedly
held
that
the
licensee
may
attack
the
validity
of
the
patent
under
which
he
was
licensed.”
and
now
i
stress
these
words
“because
of
the
public
interest
in
free
competition”,
even
though
the
licensee
has
agreed
in
his
license
not
to
do
so.
that
is
the
public
interest
in
free
competition
method.
even
though,
the
licensee
had
said
he
wouldn’t
attack
the
patent,
nevertheless
he
should
be
given
the
right
to
do
so.
and
the
court
then
concluded
in
a
suit
to
vindicate
the
public
interest
by
enjoining
violations
of
the
sherman
act,
that
is
a
suit
to
vindicate
the
public
interest
as
distinguished
from
the
private
interest
involved
in
the
private
suit.
the
united
states
should
have
the
same
opportunity
to
show
that
the
asserted
shield
of
patentability
does
not
exist.
now,
of
course,
as
our
opponents
argue
vigorously,
this
is
a
different
case,
because
here
they
haven’t
relied
upon
the
patents
as
a
defense,
but
we
think
the
basic
rational
of
that
case
and
the
whole
theory
of
all
of
this
court’s
decisions
dealing
with
the
interrelationship
of
patents
and
the
antitrust
laws
calls
for
the
same
result
in
this
case.
this
court,
in
recent
years,
has
frequently
recognized
as
it
said
lear
against
adkins,
the
important
public
interest
in
permitting
free
and
full
competition
in
the
use
of
ideas
which
are
in
realty
a
part
of
the
public
domain
and
the
strong
federal
policy
favoring
that
interest
and
in
lear
against
adkins,
it
also
referred
to
the
publics
interest
in
the
elimination
of
specious
patents.
this
concept
is
nothing
new.
80
years
ago
in
a
case
called
pope
manufacturing
v.
gormully,
this
court
stated
and
i
may
quote,
“it
is
as
important
to
the
public
that
competition
should
not
be
repressed
by
worthless
patents
as
that
the
patentee
of
a
really
valuable
invention
should
be
protected
in
his
monopoly.”
now
in
the
patent
laws,
the
congress
has
provided
that
inventories
are
to
be
rewarded
with
a
monopoly
for
17
years
and
this,
of
course,
is
designed
to
encourage
invention
to
see
that
people
who
make
significant
contributions
get
the
financial
rewards
thereof.
however,
congress
has
provided
rather
explicit
and
specific
conditions
that
have
to
be
met
before
a
patent
can
be
granted.
there
are
of
course,
the
standards
of
inventiveness,
non-obviousness,
the
fact
that
the
invention
can
not
be
patentable
if
it
was
made
public
more
than
a
year
before
the
applications
filed,
and
also
certain
things
that
are
involved
in
this
case
as
to
what
has
to
be
disclosed
in
the
patent
application.
now,
if
these
requirements
are
not
met,
it’s
clearly,
we
think,
and
this
court
has
recognized,
it’s
in
the
public
interest
that
such
patent
be
invalidated.
the
patent
monopoly,
of
course,
and
for
very
valid
reasons
is
an
exception
to
the
basic
principle
of
free
competition
that
is
reflected
in
the
sherman
act.
the
court
itself
so
stated
in
the
lear
case.
and
therefore
in
the
light
of
that
fact
that
it
is
an
exception
to
the
policy
free
competition,
we
think
it
is
important
that
the
patent
monopoly
only
exist
when
specific
terms
congress
has
provided
for
it,
in
fact,
are
satisfied.
the
purpose
of
a
government
antitrust
suit,
of
course,
is
to
eliminate
restraints
upon
competition.
by
definition,
an
invalid
patent,
one
that
has
not
met
the
standards
congress
has
provided,
involves
precisely
an
impermissible
restraint
of
that
type.
and
we,
therefore,
think
it
is
appropriate
that
when
the
government
brings
an
antitrust
suit
in
which
involves
patent
--
in
which
the
patents
are
involved
that
it
should
be
permitted
in
that
suit
also
to
challenge
the
patents,
because
such
a
challenge
furthers
the
basic
principle
of
the
lawsuit.
that
is
the
purpose
of
the
attorney
general
in
bringing
a
suit
under
the
antitrust
laws,
is
to
eliminate
restraints
on
competition
and
where
a
patent
is
involved
in
an
antitrust
violation
that
is
a
restraint
also
on
competition
in
one
which
furthers
and
then
in
fact
strengthens
the
basic
restraint
arising
under
the
antitrust
laws.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
as
a
matter
of
logic
mr.
justice,
certainly
and
in
the
court
bellow,
we
argued
this
case
on
alternative
theories.
we
argue
that
general
theory
and
we
also
argued
this
as
we
have
explained
in
our
reply
brief
the
narrower
theory
that
here
the
patents
were
involved
in
the
antitrust
violation.
in
this
court,
we
have
not
abandoned
the
position
maintained
bellow
but
we
have
brought
the
case
to
this
court
on
the
narrow
ground
because
we
think
in
this
case,
we
think
that
in
this
case,
here,
the
patents
were
involved
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
they
were
not
an
issue
only
because--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
they
were
not
relied
upon
by
the
defendants.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
except
mr.
justice
that
we
did
make
an
allegation
that
the
patents
were
involved.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
we
would
not
--
the
mere
fact
mr.
justice
that
the
patent
is
invalid,
would
not
be
enough
to
establish
a
violation
of
the
antitrust
laws
because
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
monopoly
on
the
colloquial
sense
mr.
justice
but
this
court
held
in
the
walker
process
case
that
that
itself
was
not
enough
to
establish
a
violation
of
section
2.
that
is
the
mere
fact
that
you
have
an
invalid
patent
and
enforce
it,
if
the
patent
is
subsequently
invalidated,
that
is
not
enough
to
establish
a
violation
of
section
two
and
therefore
in
that
kind
of
a
case,
we
would
not
be
able
to
show
that
the
patent
was
involved
in
an
independent
antitrust
violation.
i
concede
that
as
matter
of
logic,
the
policy
arguments
i
have
made,
would
point
to
the
direction
that
we
can
challenge
it
and
everything,
but
that’s
an
issues
that
does
not
have
to
be
faced
in
this
case,
we
think
mr.
justice,
because
in
this
case,
we
think
the
patents
are
involved
in
the
antitrust
violations.
and
let
me
explain
just
briefly,
if
i
may,
why
we
think
that
is
so.
these
patents,
basically
we
think,
were
the
foundation
upon
which
the
illegal
bulk
sales
prohibition
rested.
to
begin
with
the
restriction
is
contained
in
the
patent
licensing
agreements.
the
agreement
between
glaxo
and
ici,
the
original
agreement
which
involved
the
pooling
of
patents
and
the
cross-licensing
itself
was
the
first
time
in
which
glaxo
insisted
that
ici
should
prevent
its
licensees
from
selling
in
bulk.
now,
the
thing--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
we
would
not
argue?
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well
i
thought
mr.
justice
stewart’s
questions
to
be
did
not
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
pardon?
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
you
are
asking
it
differently.
well,
i
would
think
even
if
the
government
or
if
private
would
bring
any
trouble.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
i
would
not
think
that
a
private
party
would
mr.
justice.
i
don’t--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
because
of
the
role
of
the
attorney
general
has
in
this
case.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
he
could
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
certainly
mr.
justice.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
he
could
challenge
it.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
would
think
that
if--
well
the
trouble
damages
would
have
to
be
based
on
a
violation
on
of
the
--
on
the
violation
of
the
antitrust
laws,
and
we
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
it’s
been
so
held,
yes.
the
violation
of
the
antitrust
laws,
but
it
would
not
entitle
get
trouble
damages
on
the
basis
of
invalidating
the
patent.
trouble
damages
could
be
obtained
for
the
violations
of
the
antitrust
laws
it
would
bound.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
on
the
court
rules,
there
was
discussion
about
the
relationship
between
this
suit
and
private
litigation
and
i
would
just
like
to
come
back
to
that
in
a
minute
if
i
may,
because
we
think
it
is
somewhat
anomalous
that
the
government
has
denied
the
right
to
challenge
patents
in
an
antitrust
suit
that
are
involved
in
the
violation
where
it
is
asserting
the
public
interest
yet
it’s
well
settled
that
in
private
suits,
private
bodies
in
many
situations
had
standing
to
challenge
the
validity
of
patents.
for
example,
if
a
patent
licensee
is
sued
for
infringement
or
if
a
person
is
sued
for
infringement
or
patent
licensee
is
sued
for
royalties,
he
always
has
the
right
to
assert
as
the
defense
that
the
patent
is
invalid.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
it’s
not
historic,
but
it’s
the
principle
that
this
court
has
long
since
recognized
mr.
justice
and
indeed
it
goes
a
little
--
it
goes
even
--
it
goes
beyond
that,
it
seems
to
us.
it
goes
beyond
that
because
under
the
patent
misuse
doctrine,
the
courts
of
equity
will
frequently
deny
their
processes
to
bar
enforcement
of
a
patent
not
where
there
has
been
a
violation
of
the
antitrust
laws
as
such
but
even
where
the
patentee
has
engaged
in
anticompetitive
conduct.
and
we
think
that
in
the
light
of
that
settled
practice
when
dealing
with
the
rights
to
challenge
patents
in
private
suits,
certainly
the
government
should
have
no
lesser
interest
when
it
is
suing
to
protect
the
public
interest.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
it
seemed
--
there
is
no
such
indication,
but
it
does
appear
mr.
justice,
i
mean
the
limitation
was
a
part
of
the
patent
licensing
agreement.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
presumably,
one
of
the
conditions
for
the
patent
license
was
that
they
accepted
this
restriction
and
indeed
the
fact
that
the
appellees
considered
this
restriction
so
important,
i
think
it’s
shown
by
the
fact
that
when
they
had
their
cross-licensing
agreement,
they
agreed
that
ici
would
impose
this
restriction
upon
its
licensee.
so
that
it
seems
to
us
that
this
whole
thing
was
part
of
a
single
transaction
and
i
just
may
refer
in
this
connection
to
point
out
that
the
position
we
are
advocating
here
would
fully
accord
with
this
court’s
statement
only
last
term
in
the
blonder-tongue
case,
the
recognition
that
this
court’s
decisions
do
encourage
authority
of
testing
a
patent
validity.
and
as
one
final
point
to
make
that
in
this
particular
situation,
if
the
government
is
not
permitted
to
challenge
this
patent,
it
is
unlikely
that
anyone
else
will.
and,
of
course,
in
permitting
challenges
by
licensees,
this
court
has
stressed
that
frequently
the
licensee
is
the
only
one
who
has
an
interest
in
challenging.
now
in
this
case,
certainly
the
three
licensees
who
have
had
the
benefit
of
what
i
shall
come
to
when
i
discussed
the
relief
of
basically
a
noncompetitive,
highly
concentrated
market,
there
is
no
reason
to
think
they
would
have
any
incentive
to
challenge
the
patents.
and
the
people
who
are
trying
to
get
into
this
market
are
the
small
generic
drug
manufacturers,
who
don’t
sell
under
brand
names,
but
they
are
small
companies,
the
market
itself
is
not
an
overwhelming
and
large
one,
and
they
would
have
no
interest
to
challenge
it.
now
what
is
the
basic
position
that
the
appellees
urge
as
to
why
we
shouldn’t
have
this
power.
first
of
all,
they
tell
us
that,
“well,
you
don’t
come
within
gypsum,
because
we
have
not
relied
on
the
patents
as
a
defense.”
well,
gypsum,
of
course,
merely
held
that
where
the
government
--
where
the
defendants
do
rely
on
the
patents
as
a
defense,
the
government
can
challenge
the
patents.
it
didn’t
at
all
deal
with
the
question
where
if
the
patents
are
not
relied
on
as
a
defense,
whether
the
government
can
challenge
them
nonetheless
if
they
are
involved
in
antitrust
violation.
and
then
i
come
to
the
one,
but
i
just
want
to
say
here
at
the
exhibit,
basically,
we
don’t
think
they
make
any
convincing
policy
arguments
as
to
why
the
government
should
not
be
able
to
do
this.
their
major
argument
and
indeed
the
principal
reliance
of
the
court
--
district
court
was
on
this
court’s
decision
in
the
bell
telephone
case,
75
years
ago.
the
bell
telephone
case
was
suit
in
which
the
government
challenged
certain
of
the
bell
telephone
patents
as
having
been
obtained
by
fraud
on
the
patent
office
by
alleged
misrepresentations,
and
we
thus
brought
a
suit
to
cancel
the
patents.
the
circuit
court
held
that
the
government
had
not
proven
fraud
and
dismissed
the
suit
and
this
court
affirmed
the
dismissal
saying
that
the
whole
theory
of
the
government
that
these
people
had
failed
to
move
with
sufficient
dispatch
before
the
patent
office
and
that
therefore
they
were
extending
the
life
of
the
patent
and
the
protection
of
the
patent.
they
said
that
is
not
fraud
within
the
rule
that
permits
the
government
to
challenge
a
patentee
for
--
to
cancel
a
patent
for
fraud.
and
then
the
court
went
on
and
commented
on
a
statement
made
in
an
earlier
decision
involving
the
bell
case,
which
it
suggested
that
the
government
could
also
perhaps
challenge
a
patent
for
mistake
on
the
part
of
the
patent
officials,
their
judgment,
and
so
on,
and
--
what
the
court
said
was
that,
“in
making
the
statement
of
the
earlier
case,
it
was
not
intending
to
suggest
or
state
that.”
and
this
is
the
quotation,
“the
courts
of
the
united
states
sitting
as
courts
of
equity
could
entertain
jurisdiction
of
a
suit
by
the
united
states
to
set
aside
a
patent
for
an
invention
on
the
mere
ground
of
error
of
judgment
on
the
part
of
the
patent
officials.
that
would
be
an
attempt
on
the
part
of
the
courts
in
collateral
attack
to
exercise
an
appellate
jurisdiction
over
the
decisions
of
the
patent
office,
although
no
appellate
jurisdiction
has
been
by
the
statutes
conferred.”
now,
to
begin
with,
the
rationale
that
was
announced
in
the
bell
telephone
case
that
permitting
the
government
to
maintain
such
a
suit
would
amount
to
an
impermissible
collateral
attack
on
the
patent
office.
that
is
the
identical
theory
upon
which
the
district
court
in
gypsum
refused
to
permit
the
government
to
challenge
the
patent.
and
one
which
we
think
this
court
implicitly
rejected
in
its
gypsum
decision.
and,
of
course,
as
a
practical
matter,
patents
are
challenged
and
the
decisions
of
the
patent
commissioner
are
reviewed
all
the
time
in
the
courts
of
this
country.
and
what
happens
is
whenever
there
is
a
patent
suit
and
the
patent
is
challenged,
the
district
court
in
determining
whether
the
patent
is
valid
or
invalid
to
that
extent
reviews
the
decision
of
the
commissioner
of
patents.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
but
i
am
suggesting
mr.
justice
that
the
fact
that
the
court
is
in
effect
reviewing
the
decision
of
the
patent
commissioner.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
but
we
think
this
is
an
appropriate
ancillary
phase
of
the
case.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
think
it
is
pendent
to
the
antitrust.
i
think
under
the
section
4
of
the
sherman
act,
the
jurisdiction,
the
jurisdiction
of
the
district
court
embraces
anything
that
is
ancillary
and
in
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
perhaps
under
other
sections,
but
not
on
the
--
i
wouldn’t
think
under
section
4
of
the
sherman
act,
under
the
other
provisions
dealing
with
it.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
we
don’t
say
that
the
mere
practice
of
an
invalid
patent
itself
is
a
violation
of
the
sherman
act.
what
we
do
say
is
there
have
to
be
more
than
that
to
be
a
violation
of
the
sherman
act,
and
i
assume
your
hypothetical
was
that
all
we
had
was
just
a
naked
suit
challenging
a
patent.
we
wouldn’t
say
that
there
is
jurisdiction
to
deal
with
that
under
the
sherman
act.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
i
would
suggest
two
sections,
mr.
justice.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
one
is
1338
(a),
the
original
jurisdiction
of
any
civil
action
arising
under
any
act
of
congress
relating
to
patents
and
then
also
the
section
where
the
united
states
is
the
plaintiff
in
the
suit.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
whether
the
government
has
standing
to
challenge
a
patent
involved
in
an
antitrust
violation
where
there
is
no
claim
of
fraud
on
the
patent
office
and
where
the
patent
is
not
relied
on
as
a
defense.
that’s
the
case
that
we
have
put
to
the
court.
now
of
course
the
other
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
we
think
not
mr.
justice
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
but
then
--
and
then
they
went
on
to
say
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
but
the
court
went
on
and
did
decide.
the
court
went
on
and
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
no,
i
am
sorry.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
but
of
course
in
the
gypsum
case,
we
were
challenging
the
validity
of
the
patent
only
because
the
defendants
were
relying
on
it,
whereas
in
this
case,
they
are
not
relying
on
it,
and
we
are
challenging
the
patent
that's
incidental
to
antitrust
violation.
now
if
i
may
come
to
two
other
respects
in
which
i
think
the
bell
case
is
quite
different.
first
of
all,
the
statement
in
the
bell
case
of
course
was
not
necessary
to
the
decision
in
the
case
because
the
actual
holding
in
the
case
was
that
the
government
had
not
proved
fraud.
secondly
and
more
importantly,
the
bell
case
was
decided
only
seven
years
after
the
sherman
act
was
passed.
there
is
no
reference
in
the
opinion
in
the
bell
case
to
the
sherman
act
and
again,
the
bell
case
did
not
involve
any
challenge
to
a
patent
in
connection
with
an
antitrust
suit.
it
was
a
naked
challenge
to
the
patent
and
the
court
said
that
in
a
naked
challenge
to
the
patent
by
the
government
where
the
government
challenge
is
to
fraud
in
fact,
that
it
cannot
challenge
is
just
on
the
ground
of
a
mistake
on
the
part
of
the
patent
office.
and
we
think
that
in
the
light
of
the
more
recent
decisions
of
this
court,
dealing,
giving
broader
rights
to
challenge
patents
and
the
right
of
its
repeated
statements
of
the
importance
of
permitting
authoritative
testing
of
patents.
if
bell
is
read
as
precluding,
the
government’s
challenge
to
the
patent
in
this
situation,
we
then
suggest
that
bell
should
be
reexamined
and
rejected
to
that
extent.
i
would
now
like
to
turn
to
the
other
phase
of
this
case
which
is
the
relief
aspects,
and
what
we
think
is
the
court
erred
in
failing
to
grant
us
these
two
additional
items
of
relief,
that
is
to
require
the
appellees
to
sell
in
bulk
and
to
give
reasonable
patent
license
royalties.
this
court
has
many
times
specified
the
purposes
of
antitrust
relief
to
cure
the
ill
effects
of
the
illegal
conduct
and
protect
the
public
from
its
continuation.
it
has
said
that
the
relief
must
be
affected
to
restore
competition
and
in
a
much
quoted
statement
from
the
international
salt
case
that
it
should
pry
open
to
competition
a
market
that
has
been
closed
by
the
defendant’s
illegal
restraints.
now
of
course,
the
district
court
has
brought
discretion
in
framing
relief
in
antitrust
cases,
but
this
court
again
has
pointed
out
that
it
has
never
hesitated
to
step
in
what
is
described
as
perhaps
the
most
critical
aspect
of
the
antitrust
case
to
take
whatever
steps
are
necessary
to
ensure
that
the
relief
is
adequate.
now,
while
the
bulk
sales
prohibition
was
in
effect,
there
were
no
sales
of
this
product
in
bulk
in
the
united
states.
the
three
licensees
had
all
of
the
market
and
as
would
be
expected
in
this
kind
of
a
situation,
the
other
prices
were
virtually
identical.
we
have
figures
in
the
record
showing
them
prices
charged
by
the
three
licensees
at
wholesale
to
the
druggists.
on
the
regular
size
of
the
capsule,
the
prices
were
identical
of
all
three
of
the
licensees,
$10.40
for
a
bottle
of
100
capsules
in
the
most
popular
size.
in
the
micro-size
type
of
drug
which
as
i
indicated
is
the
most
popular
at
the
moment,
there
were
micro-size
variations
in
the
prices,
one
of
them
charged
$12.14,
the
other
$12.10
and
the
other
third
one,
$12.04,
once
again,
substantially
identical
prices.
the
three
licensees
are
three
of
the
major
drug
firms
in
this
country.
they
sell
drugs
under
well
known
trademark
names.
they
advertise
extensively.
they
engage,
as
we
all
know,
in
very
extensive
promotion.
there
are
several
small
firms
in
the
drug
business
who
are
so
called
generic
drug
manufacturers.
they
sell
the
same
product
under
the
generic
name
or
under
their
own
name
which
is
not
well
advertised.
these
firms
compete
on
price.
they
do
not
have
the
big
name
brand,
but
they
are
able
to
sell
the
drug
cheaper
and
many
people
are
willing
to
accept
the
non-named
brand
for
a
lesser
price.
and
the
evidence
in
this
case
is
that
for
the
generic
distributor
to
be
able
to
compete
effectively
with
the
brand
name
on
a
product
like
this
griseofulvin,
they
have
to
sell
it
about
two
thirds
the
price
that
the
brand
name
charges.
there
is
also
indication
that
several
of
these
drug
manufacturers
are
very
interested
in
going
into
the
griseofulvin
business.
after
the
appellees
had
canceled,
shortly
after
the
time
the
suit
was
brought,
the
restriction
on
bulk
sales,
american
home
products
offered
both
bulk
griseofulvin
and
the
capsule
form
in
this
country.
but
the
testimony
is
that
they
offered
it
at
prices
to
these
generic
manufacturers
at
which
the
later
could
not
effectively
compete
in
the
market.
for
example,
ici
charged
its
licensee,
american
home
$78
a
kilogram
for
bulk
griseofulvin.
ici
in
turn
offered
the
same
bulk
product
to
these
generic
firms
at
prices
ranging
from
$118
to
a
$141
a
kilogram.
it's
hardly
surprising
that
the
other
firms
beside
the
licensees
were
not
interested
in
purchasing
and
could
not
do
so
economically.
now
american
home
products
also
offered
capsules
and
once
again,
statements
by
two
of
the
generic
manufacturers
stated
that
they
couldn't
compete
effectively
with
american
home
products
at
the
prices
american
home
was
quoting
to
them,
which
presumably
was
a
price
at
which
american
home
would
make
a
profit.
two
of
them
did
buy
some
capsules.
now
once
more
firm
bought
a
million
capsules
for
distribution
in
order
that
came
to
about
$46,000
and
after
they
had
finished
distributing
with
all
their
marketing
and
distribution
cost,
they
discovered
that
they
were
losing
$2.30
on
very
bottle
they
sold.
and
when
american
home
products
refused
to
reduce
the
price,
of
course,
they
stopped
any
broad
scale
promotion
of
griseofulvin.
the
$2.30
figure
is
contained
in
the
statement
at
page
228
of
the
record.
now
this
evidence
as
to
what
happened
after
the
parties
terminated
their
bulk
sales
restrictions,
demonstrates
to
us
that
an
order
of
the
district
court
merely
prohibiting
the
restraint
of
both
sales
isn't
going
to
have
any
effect
at
all
in
restoring
competition
in
this
market.
all
that
order
would
do
would
be
to
continue
by
judicial
decree
of
what
the
parties
have
been
doing
up
till
that
time.
there
is
no
reason
to
think
that
if
all
we
have
in
this
case
is
an
order
directing
the
appellees
to
stop
prohibiting
bulk
sales
that
there
is
going
to
be
any
change
in
this
market,
why
should
the
appellees
now
decide
to
permit
the
various
competitors
to
come
into
the
market?
there
is
no
reason
why
because
this
market
has
continued
for
10
or
12
years
in
a
concentrated
noncompetitive
situation
and
there
is
no
reason
on
earth
why
unless
they
are
required
to
do
something
more
than
what
has
been
done
that
there
is
going
to
be
any
competition.
the
appellees
have
been
selling
at,
one
of
them,
glaxo
at
$60
a
kilogram,
ici
at
$78
a
kilogram
for
many
years.
there
is
no
reason
to
think
that
they
are
not
profiting
in
this
business
and
we
see
no
reason
why
they
shouldn't
also
be
ordered
to
sell
and
to
offer
this
product
to
the
other
people
in
the
united
states
who
want
to
enter
the
market.
we
want
to
make
it
very
clear
and
in
our
proposed
judgment,
all
that
we
are
saying
is
that
if
they
continue
to
sell
in
this
country,
if
they
continue
to
sell
in
this
country,
they
have
to
offer
the
product
to
all
on
non
--
at
a
nondiscriminatory
level
and
we
think
this
is
what
is
required
in
order
to
inject
some
competition
into
this
market.
and
when
i
say
inject
some
competition,
frequently
the
relief
is
framed
in
terms
of
to
restore
competition,
to
restore
the
status
quo.
in
this
case,
there
is
nothing
to
restore
because
there
has
never
been
any
competition
in
this
market.
this
market
started
on
a
noncompetitive
concentrated
basis
and
that's
the
way
it's
continued.
we
also
are
urging
that
there
should
be
compulsory
licensing
of
patents
at
reasonable
royalties.
we
have
covered
that
fully
in
our
brief
and
i
would
then
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
thank
you.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
we
think
that
this
patent
--
inevitably
this
patent
most
assuredly
was
involved
in
these
violations.
we
think
the
patent
in
a
very
real
sense
was
the
whole
key
to
these
violations
because
without
the
power
of
the
patents,
these
firms
could
not
have
been
able
to
impose
these
bulk
sales
restrictions.
and
when
mr.
timberg
talks
about
the
pooling
arrangement
that
this
was
just
designed
to
correct
any
problem
in
the
united
kingdom
where
they
had
to
cross-license.
the
fact
is
that
in
addition
to
the
pooling
of
the
patents,
glaxo
saw
fit
and
feel
it
necessary
in
that
agreement
to
prohibit
ici
from
permitting
its
licensees
to
sell
in
bulk.
so,
obviously
it
was
not
just
something
that
this
people
added,
this
bulk
thing
has
an
afterthought,
the
patent
license
was
all
tied
in
with
the
bulk
situation.
and
i
would
like
to
invite
the
court's
attention
to
a
document
on
page
86
of
the
record
in
which
a
man
from
ici
was
discussing
with
someone
from
squibb,
not
one
of
the
licensees,
their
interest
in
griseofulvin.
and
what
this
man
said
was
i
gave
mr.
dow
(ph)
that
is
of
ici
some
idea
of
the
patent
situation
on
griseofulvin
in
such
form
as
will
i
hope
have
impressed
upon
him
the
impossibility
of
squibb
trading
in
griseofulvin
without
a
license
from
glaxo
under
the
ici
and
glaxo
patents.
in
other
words,
this
whole
market
was
tied
up.
the
whole
market
was
kept
free
from
any
competition
because
of
these
patents
and
that's
why
we
think
these
patents
are
involved
in
the
violation.
the
leverage
of
the
patents,
the
power
of
the
patents
was
an
important
element
in
effecting
the
violation.
now
mr.
sailer
has
said
that
our
argument
that
the
licensees'
self-interest
will
lead
them
to
continue
the
existing
situation
proves
too
much
because
it
says
that
proves
then
even
had
there
not
been
these
restraints.
nevertheless,
the
licensees
independently
would
have
reached
the
same
result.
but
the
self-interest
we're
talking
about
now
is
their
self-interest
in
continuing
the
existing
situation
and
with
respect
to
the
claim
that
the
appellees
have
sold
so
little
--
i
am
sorry,
the
licensees
have
in
affect
been
de
minimis
in
selling
other
drugs
in
bulk
and
therefore
its
a
reasonable
assumption
they
wouldn't
have
sold
these
drugs
in
bulk.
mr.
sailer
referred
to
statistics
shown
in
1969,
ici
sold
only
oh,
$8000-10,000
worth
of
drugs.
the
documents
are
contained
at
pages
239-244
of
the
record.
in
earlier
years
for
example,
in
1961
ici
sold
better
than
$200,000
worth
of
the
drugs
and
if
you
look
through
these
particular
things
in
1962,
ici
sold
$223,000
of
this
drug
and
one
other
fact,
there
is
also
in
the
record
at
234,
i
am
sorry
243-244
which
shows
bulk
sales
by
the
schering
corporation
of
other
drugs.
and
in
a
period
of
10
years,
this
firm
sold
approximately
11
million
dollars
in
bulk
other
than
griseofulvin.
in
the
face
of
that,
we
think
that
it
cannot
be
said
that
if
it
had
not
been
for
these
restrictions
in
the
bulk
sales,
they
nevertheless
would
have
accomplished
the
same
objective.
we
don't
know.
we
do
know
there
were
these
restrictions,
we
do
know
that
the
market
filing
this
restrictions
is
noncompetitive
and
we
think
appropriate
relief
is
to
make
it
competitive
for
the
first
time.
and
mr.
chief
justice,
i
have
misspoke
myself
at
one
point
where
i
said,
ici
and
i
meant
american
home
products.
mr.
sailer
is
properly
correct.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
well,
this
is
a
government
civil
antitrust
case,
here
on
direct
appeal
to
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
district
of
columbia,
which
presents
two
basically
unrelated
issues.
the
first
issue
is
whether
in
a
civil
antitrust
case,
the
government
may
challenge
validity
of
patents
which
although
not
relied
upon
by
the
defendants
as
a
defense
to
the
antitrust
charge
and
nevertheless
involved
in
the
antitrust
violations
case.
and
the
second
issue
is
whether
the
relief
given
by
the
district
court
in
this
case
was
inadequate.
the
appellees,
the
glaxo
group
ltd.
and
imperial
chemical
industries
inc,
which
i
should
refer
to
as
ici,
are
two
british
drug
firms.
the
drug
involved
in
this
case
is
an
antibiotic
called
griseofulvin.
griseofulvin
itself
is
an
old
product
and
is
unpatented
and
for
many
years
was
used
as
fungicide
in
the
treatment
of
fungus
infection
of
plants.
in
the
1950s,
ici
discovered
that
if
griseofulvin
was
taken
internally,
it
would
be
able
to
cure
various
fungus
infections
such
as
ringworms
on
the
skin
of
people
and
animals.
and
as
a
result
of
these
discoveries,
in
1959,
ici
obtained
a
patent
upon
this
new
use
of
the
drug.
the
patent
contained
two
basic
claims.
the
first
was
a
so-called
method
claim
which
consisted
of
a
method
of
curing
external
fungus
infections
of
animals
and
people
by
the
administration
of
what
they
describe
as
an
effective
amount
of
griseofulvin.
the
second
claim
was
a
so-called
product
claim.
it
was
described
as
pill,
a
capsule
or
a
container
containing
an
effective
amount
of
griseofulvin
which
would
accomplish
this
objective.
and
this
is
the
basic
patent,
these
two
claims
which
the
government
is
here
challenging.
in
1967,
the
other
appellee
glaxo
obtained
a
united
states
patent
on
an
improved
form
of
griseofulvin,
the
so-called
micro
size
form
of
the
drug,
which
is
very
much
ground
up
in
very
small
particles
which
is
proven
to
be
much
more
effective
than
the
original
form,
which
is
the
one
now
of
principal
commercial
significance.
between
1957
and
1960,
the
two
appellees
had
extensive
discussions,
looking
to
a
pooling
of
their
patents
and
cross-licensing,
and
in
1960,
they
reach
such
an
agreement
under
which
the
patents
on
griseofulvin
of
the
two
companies
were
pooled
and
they
cross-licensed
each
other.
and
in
addition
to
that,
in
this
agreement,
ici
agreed
that
it
would
use
its
best
endeavors
to
make
sure
that
its
licensees
did
not
sell
griseofulvin
in
bulk
to
third
persons
without
the
consent
of
glaxo.
in
1962,
ici
appointed
the
american
home
products
corporation,
an
american
firm
as
its
exclusive
distributor
of
griseofulvin.
it
previously
had
appointed
this
firm
as
its
exclusive
distributor
for
other
drugs.
and
in
its
license
to
american
home
products,
it
required
an
agreement
that
american
home
products
in
turn
would
not
sell
this
drug
in
bulk
to
any
third
persons
without
the
written
permission
of
ici.
shortly
before
this,
glaxo
had
granted
similar,
made
a
similar
agreement
with
two
other
american
firms,
schering
corporation
and
johnson
&
johnson,
appointing
them
as
distributors
for
the
drug
griseofulvin
in
the
united
states
and
the
agreements
of
glaxo
with
these
two
licensees
similarly
provide
that
the
licensees
could
not
sell
in
bulk
without
the
written
approval
of
the
licensor.
each
of
these
agreements
gave
the
people
cross-licenses
under
the
patents.
that
is
glaxo
license
under
its
own
and
ici’s
patents,
ici
license
under
its
and
the
glaxo
patent,
and
each
of
these
was
in
form,
the
form
of
a
patent
licensing
agreement.
that
is
they
--
in
addition
to
the
bulk
sales
restriction,
the
basic
agreement
was
they
licensed
them
to
manufacture
and
sell
under
the
patents
and
each
of
the
licensees
was
required
to
pay
a
royalty
to
the
licensor
based
upon
the
total
amount
of
the
griseofulvin
which
they
purchased
from
the
english
firms
and
sold.
now,
although
the
license
has
permitted
the
american
firms
to
manufacture,
the
fact
is
that
throughout
this
entire
period,
all
three
of
the
american
licensees
purchased
all
of
their
griseofulvin
from
the
english
firms.
during
this
entire
period,
neither
glaxo
nor
ici
made
any
bulk
sales
to
anyone,
other
than
the
three
licensees
and
the
three
licensees
themselves
made
no
bulk
sales
at
all
to
anyone
in
the
united
states.
shortly
before
this
suit
was
filed
when
the
appellees
were
informed
that
the
justice
department
was
investigating
the
legality
of
these
bulk
sales
restrictions,
they
canceled
them.
since
that
time,
american
home
products
corporation
has
made
a
few
sales
of
the
griseofulvin,
not
in
bulk,
but
in
the
capsule
form.
now
when
this
government
suit
was
filed
in
march
1968,
the
three
licensees
together
had
a
100%
of
the
market
and
at
the
time
the
record
was
closed
a
couple
of
years
later
they
had
98.5%
of
the
market.
the
government
suit
alleged
that
the
bulk
sales
limitations
contained
in
the
licenses
and
also
in
the
ici,
glaxo
patent
pooling
arrangement
violated
section
1
of
the
sherman
act.
the
government
complaint
also
challenged
the
ici
patent
on
two
grounds.
we
contended
that
the
method
patent
was
invalid,
because
it
did
not
disclose
how
to
practice
the
invention,
since
it’s
nowhere
stated
what
was
an
effective
amount
of
griseofulvin,
and
of
course,
the
patent,
the
idea
that
was
patented
was
the
administration
of
an
effective
amount
necessary
to
cure
these
diseases.
as
we
said,
all
that
it
said
was
an
effective
amount
and
that
didn’t
sufficiently
disclose
the
method
of
practice
in
the
invention
so
that
when
the
patent
ultimately
expires,
this
patented
information
will
be
available
to
the
public.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
this
was
in
the
complaint,
mr.
justice.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
we
didn’t
spell
out
in
the
compliant
but
we
said
that
these
patents
were
invalid
and
the
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no
they
have
not
relied
on
the
patent.
no,
our
basic
theory
mr.
justice
white
is
that
we
have
the
right
in
an
antitrust
case
where
we
allege
and
claim
that
the
patents
were
involved
in
the
violation,
we
have
the
right
as
an
incident
to
that
antitrust
suit
to
challenge
the
violation.
of
course,
here
our
allegation
is
that
these
bulk
sales
agreements
restrictions
were
invalid
and
these
of
course
will
brought
the
patent
licensing
agreements.
now
we
also
challenged
the
so-called
product
claim
on
the
ground
that
all
this
was,
was
a
new
use
of
the
well-known
product
and
if
you
couldn’t
get
a
product
claim
on
that
that
could
only
be
patented
under
the
method
claim.
though
it
is
not
in
this
case
a
trial
in
the
traditional
sense,
the
case
was
decided
on
various
motions
for
partial
summary
judgment.
however,
an
extensive
record
was
produced,
it
occupies
400
pages
in
this
court
and
extensive
facts
were
developed
through
affidavits,
through
depositions,
through
stipulations,
through
various
documents.
the
district
court
held
that
the
ban
upon
the
sales
of
bulk
of
the
griseofulvin
and
both
the
patent
licensing
agreements
and
the
cross-licensing
agreements
was
per
se
violation
of
section
one
of
the
sherman
act,
because
under
this
court’s
decision
in
the
schwinn
case
in
388
u.s.
it
was
an
impermissible
restraint
by
the
manufacture
upon
alienation.
that
is
the
manufacturer

or
is

and
control
over
the

when
he
sold
it
to
the
american
licensees
and
he
could
not
thereafter
control
the
disposition
made
by
the
american
licensees.
the
district
court
however,
struck
from
the
complaint
the
allegations
with
respect
to
the
invalidity
of
the
patents.
the
court
said
that
the
government
had
no
standing
to
litigate
this
issue
and
there
were
two
grounds
of
its
decision
--
it’s
really
one
ground.
what
it
said
was
as
it
interpreted
the
prior
decisions
of
this
court,
the
government
may
challenge
the
validity
of
a
patent
only
in
two
circumstances.
one,
where
it
is
alleged
the
patent
has
been
obtained
by
fraud
on
the
patent
office.
there
was
no
such
claim
here.
two,
where
the
defendants
rely
upon
the
patent
as
a
defense
to
the
antitrust
case,
and
since
the
defendants
here,
the
expressed
it,
one
of
the
ici
had
disavowed
the
reliance
on
the
patent
is
concluded
that
the
government
had
no
standing
and
consistent
with
that
decision,
it
also
denied
the
government’s
motion
to
file
an
amended
complaint,
which
among,
other
things,
would
have
also
challenged
the
validity
of
the
later
glaxo
patent.
the
judgment
the
district
court
entered
in
this
case
prohibits
the
appellees
from
participating,
adhering,
enforcing
it
anyway,
agreement
prohibiting
or
limiting
the
resale
in
bulk
of
not
only
griseofulvin
but
of
all
drugs
that
it
sells
in
the
united
states.
the
district
court
however
refused
to
grant
two
other
provisions
which
the
government
asserted
was
essential
to
dissipate
the
effects
of
this
illegal
conduct.
that
is,
we
said
in
addition
to
that
the
court
should
order
the
appellees
themselves
to
grant
licenses
in
bulk
as
long
as
they
sell
in
the
united
states
on
reasonable,
nondiscriminatory
terms
and
in
addition
we
urge
that
they
should
be
required
to
grant
licenses
under
their
patents
at
reasonable
royalties.
and
i
will
discus
the
facts
relating
to
the
need
for
this
relief
when
i
come
to
discus
the
relief
portions
of
the
case.
now,
under
this
court’s
decision
in
the
gypsum
case,
there
is
no
question
that
if
the
defendants
rely
upon
a
patent
as
a
defense
to
a
antitrust
case
involving
patents,
the
government
then
has
standing
to
challenge
the
patents.
in
the
gypsum
case,
what
happened
was
the
government
alleged
that
an
industry
wide
price-fixing
system
resulting
from
the
series
of
patent
licenses
violated
the
sherman
act.
the
defendants
in
that
case
admitted
that
if
their
patents
didn’t
provide
a
defense,
their
conduct
was
illegal.
but
they
asserted
the
patents
did
provide
a
defense.
at
that
point,
the
government
then
moved
to
amend
the
complaint
to
challenge
the
validity
of
the
patents.
the
district
court
refused
to
permit
the
government
to
do
that,
saying
that
if
you
permitted
the
government
in
an
antitrust
suit
to
challenge
the
validity
of
patents
that
would
involve
a
collateral
attack
upon
the
decision
of
commissioner
of
patents
granting
a
patent,
and
that
the
statute
do
not
permit
such
collateral
attack.
when
the
case
came
to
this
court
on
the
government’s
appeal,
the
court
said
it
was
actually
unnecessary
to
decide
that
issue
because
it
concluded
that
what
the
defendants
had
done
in
that
case
could
not
be
justified
by
their
patents.
but
it
said
that
because
of
the
significance
of
the
issue
was
unwise
to
leave
that
holding
as
a
precedent,
and
therefore
took
pains
to
correct.
and
i
would
like
to
read
to
the
court
the
ground
on
which
this
court
held
that
the
district
court
had
erred
in
gypsum
in
saying
that
government
couldn’t
rely
on
the
patents.
it’s
in
333
u.s.
of
pages
387-388.
the
court
said,
“in
an
antitrust
suit,
instituted
by
a
licensee
against
his
licensor,
we
have
repeatedly
held
that
the
licensee
may
attack
the
validity
of
the
patent
under
which
he
was
licensed.”
and
now
i
stress
these
words
“because
of
the
public
interest
in
free
competition”,
even
though
the
licensee
has
agreed
in
his
license
not
to
do
so.
that
is
the
public
interest
in
free
competition
method.
even
though,
the
licensee
had
said
he
wouldn’t
attack
the
patent,
nevertheless
he
should
be
given
the
right
to
do
so.
and
the
court
then
concluded
in
a
suit
to
vindicate
the
public
interest
by
enjoining
violations
of
the
sherman
act,
that
is
a
suit
to
vindicate
the
public
interest
as
distinguished
from
the
private
interest
involved
in
the
private
suit.
the
united
states
should
have
the
same
opportunity
to
show
that
the
asserted
shield
of
patentability
does
not
exist.
now,
of
course,
as
our
opponents
argue
vigorously,
this
is
a
different
case,
because
here
they
haven’t
relied
upon
the
patents
as
a
defense,
but
we
think
the
basic
rational
of
that
case
and
the
whole
theory
of
all
of
this
court’s
decisions
dealing
with
the
interrelationship
of
patents
and
the
antitrust
laws
calls
for
the
same
result
in
this
case.
this
court,
in
recent
years,
has
frequently
recognized
as
it
said
lear
against
adkins,
the
important
public
interest
in
permitting
free
and
full
competition
in
the
use
of
ideas
which
are
in
realty
a
part
of
the
public
domain
and
the
strong
federal
policy
favoring
that
interest
and
in
lear
against
adkins,
it
also
referred
to
the
publics
interest
in
the
elimination
of
specious
patents.
this
concept
is
nothing
new.
80
years
ago
in
a
case
called
pope
manufacturing
v.
gormully,
this
court
stated
and
i
may
quote,
“it
is
as
important
to
the
public
that
competition
should
not
be
repressed
by
worthless
patents
as
that
the
patentee
of
a
really
valuable
invention
should
be
protected
in
his
monopoly.”
now
in
the
patent
laws,
the
congress
has
provided
that
inventories
are
to
be
rewarded
with
a
monopoly
for
17
years
and
this,
of
course,
is
designed
to
encourage
invention
to
see
that
people
who
make
significant
contributions
get
the
financial
rewards
thereof.
however,
congress
has
provided
rather
explicit
and
specific
conditions
that
have
to
be
met
before
a
patent
can
be
granted.
there
are
of
course,
the
standards
of
inventiveness,
non-obviousness,
the
fact
that
the
invention
can
not
be
patentable
if
it
was
made
public
more
than
a
year
before
the
applications
filed,
and
also
certain
things
that
are
involved
in
this
case
as
to
what
has
to
be
disclosed
in
the
patent
application.
now,
if
these
requirements
are
not
met,
it’s
clearly,
we
think,
and
this
court
has
recognized,
it’s
in
the
public
interest
that
such
patent
be
invalidated.
the
patent
monopoly,
of
course,
and
for
very
valid
reasons
is
an
exception
to
the
basic
principle
of
free
competition
that
is
reflected
in
the
sherman
act.
the
court
itself
so
stated
in
the
lear
case.
and
therefore
in
the
light
of
that
fact
that
it
is
an
exception
to
the
policy
free
competition,
we
think
it
is
important
that
the
patent
monopoly
only
exist
when
specific
terms
congress
has
provided
for
it,
in
fact,
are
satisfied.
the
purpose
of
a
government
antitrust
suit,
of
course,
is
to
eliminate
restraints
upon
competition.
by
definition,
an
invalid
patent,
one
that
has
not
met
the
standards
congress
has
provided,
involves
precisely
an
impermissible
restraint
of
that
type.
and
we,
therefore,
think
it
is
appropriate
that
when
the
government
brings
an
antitrust
suit
in
which
involves
patent
--
in
which
the
patents
are
involved
that
it
should
be
permitted
in
that
suit
also
to
challenge
the
patents,
because
such
a
challenge
furthers
the
basic
principle
of
the
lawsuit.
that
is
the
purpose
of
the
attorney
general
in
bringing
a
suit
under
the
antitrust
laws,
is
to
eliminate
restraints
on
competition
and
where
a
patent
is
involved
in
an
antitrust
violation
that
is
a
restraint
also
on
competition
in
one
which
furthers
and
then
in
fact
strengthens
the
basic
restraint
arising
under
the
antitrust
laws.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
as
a
matter
of
logic
mr.
justice,
certainly
and
in
the
court
bellow,
we
argued
this
case
on
alternative
theories.
we
argue
that
general
theory
and
we
also
argued
this
as
we
have
explained
in
our
reply
brief
the
narrower
theory
that
here
the
patents
were
involved
in
the
antitrust
violation.
in
this
court,
we
have
not
abandoned
the
position
maintained
bellow
but
we
have
brought
the
case
to
this
court
on
the
narrow
ground
because
we
think
in
this
case,
we
think
that
in
this
case,
here,
the
patents
were
involved
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
they
were
not
an
issue
only
because--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
they
were
not
relied
upon
by
the
defendants.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
except
mr.
justice
that
we
did
make
an
allegation
that
the
patents
were
involved.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
we
would
not
--
the
mere
fact
mr.
justice
that
the
patent
is
invalid,
would
not
be
enough
to
establish
a
violation
of
the
antitrust
laws
because
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
monopoly
on
the
colloquial
sense
mr.
justice
but
this
court
held
in
the
walker
process
case
that
that
itself
was
not
enough
to
establish
a
violation
of
section
2.
that
is
the
mere
fact
that
you
have
an
invalid
patent
and
enforce
it,
if
the
patent
is
subsequently
invalidated,
that
is
not
enough
to
establish
a
violation
of
section
two
and
therefore
in
that
kind
of
a
case,
we
would
not
be
able
to
show
that
the
patent
was
involved
in
an
independent
antitrust
violation.
i
concede
that
as
matter
of
logic,
the
policy
arguments
i
have
made,
would
point
to
the
direction
that
we
can
challenge
it
and
everything,
but
that’s
an
issues
that
does
not
have
to
be
faced
in
this
case,
we
think
mr.
justice,
because
in
this
case,
we
think
the
patents
are
involved
in
the
antitrust
violations.
and
let
me
explain
just
briefly,
if
i
may,
why
we
think
that
is
so.
these
patents,
basically
we
think,
were
the
foundation
upon
which
the
illegal
bulk
sales
prohibition
rested.
to
begin
with
the
restriction
is
contained
in
the
patent
licensing
agreements.
the
agreement
between
glaxo
and
ici,
the
original
agreement
which
involved
the
pooling
of
patents
and
the
cross-licensing
itself
was
the
first
time
in
which
glaxo
insisted
that
ici
should
prevent
its
licensees
from
selling
in
bulk.
now,
the
thing--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
we
would
not
argue?
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well
i
thought
mr.
justice
stewart’s
questions
to
be
did
not
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
pardon?
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
you
are
asking
it
differently.
well,
i
would
think
even
if
the
government
or
if
private
would
bring
any
trouble.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
i
would
not
think
that
a
private
party
would
mr.
justice.
i
don’t--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
because
of
the
role
of
the
attorney
general
has
in
this
case.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
he
could
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
certainly
mr.
justice.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
he
could
challenge
it.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
would
think
that
if--
well
the
trouble
damages
would
have
to
be
based
on
a
violation
on
of
the
--
on
the
violation
of
the
antitrust
laws,
and
we
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
it’s
been
so
held,
yes.
the
violation
of
the
antitrust
laws,
but
it
would
not
entitle
get
trouble
damages
on
the
basis
of
invalidating
the
patent.
trouble
damages
could
be
obtained
for
the
violations
of
the
antitrust
laws
it
would
bound.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
on
the
court
rules,
there
was
discussion
about
the
relationship
between
this
suit
and
private
litigation
and
i
would
just
like
to
come
back
to
that
in
a
minute
if
i
may,
because
we
think
it
is
somewhat
anomalous
that
the
government
has
denied
the
right
to
challenge
patents
in
an
antitrust
suit
that
are
involved
in
the
violation
where
it
is
asserting
the
public
interest
yet
it’s
well
settled
that
in
private
suits,
private
bodies
in
many
situations
had
standing
to
challenge
the
validity
of
patents.
for
example,
if
a
patent
licensee
is
sued
for
infringement
or
if
a
person
is
sued
for
infringement
or
patent
licensee
is
sued
for
royalties,
he
always
has
the
right
to
assert
as
the
defense
that
the
patent
is
invalid.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
it’s
not
historic,
but
it’s
the
principle
that
this
court
has
long
since
recognized
mr.
justice
and
indeed
it
goes
a
little
--
it
goes
even
--
it
goes
beyond
that,
it
seems
to
us.
it
goes
beyond
that
because
under
the
patent
misuse
doctrine,
the
courts
of
equity
will
frequently
deny
their
processes
to
bar
enforcement
of
a
patent
not
where
there
has
been
a
violation
of
the
antitrust
laws
as
such
but
even
where
the
patentee
has
engaged
in
anticompetitive
conduct.
and
we
think
that
in
the
light
of
that
settled
practice
when
dealing
with
the
rights
to
challenge
patents
in
private
suits,
certainly
the
government
should
have
no
lesser
interest
when
it
is
suing
to
protect
the
public
interest.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
it
seemed
--
there
is
no
such
indication,
but
it
does
appear
mr.
justice,
i
mean
the
limitation
was
a
part
of
the
patent
licensing
agreement.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
presumably,
one
of
the
conditions
for
the
patent
license
was
that
they
accepted
this
restriction
and
indeed
the
fact
that
the
appellees
considered
this
restriction
so
important,
i
think
it’s
shown
by
the
fact
that
when
they
had
their
cross-licensing
agreement,
they
agreed
that
ici
would
impose
this
restriction
upon
its
licensee.
so
that
it
seems
to
us
that
this
whole
thing
was
part
of
a
single
transaction
and
i
just
may
refer
in
this
connection
to
point
out
that
the
position
we
are
advocating
here
would
fully
accord
with
this
court’s
statement
only
last
term
in
the
blonder-tongue
case,
the
recognition
that
this
court’s
decisions
do
encourage
authority
of
testing
a
patent
validity.
and
as
one
final
point
to
make
that
in
this
particular
situation,
if
the
government
is
not
permitted
to
challenge
this
patent,
it
is
unlikely
that
anyone
else
will.
and,
of
course,
in
permitting
challenges
by
licensees,
this
court
has
stressed
that
frequently
the
licensee
is
the
only
one
who
has
an
interest
in
challenging.
now
in
this
case,
certainly
the
three
licensees
who
have
had
the
benefit
of
what
i
shall
come
to
when
i
discussed
the
relief
of
basically
a
noncompetitive,
highly
concentrated
market,
there
is
no
reason
to
think
they
would
have
any
incentive
to
challenge
the
patents.
and
the
people
who
are
trying
to
get
into
this
market
are
the
small
generic
drug
manufacturers,
who
don’t
sell
under
brand
names,
but
they
are
small
companies,
the
market
itself
is
not
an
overwhelming
and
large
one,
and
they
would
have
no
interest
to
challenge
it.
now
what
is
the
basic
position
that
the
appellees
urge
as
to
why
we
shouldn’t
have
this
power.
first
of
all,
they
tell
us
that,
“well,
you
don’t
come
within
gypsum,
because
we
have
not
relied
on
the
patents
as
a
defense.”
well,
gypsum,
of
course,
merely
held
that
where
the
government
--
where
the
defendants
do
rely
on
the
patents
as
a
defense,
the
government
can
challenge
the
patents.
it
didn’t
at
all
deal
with
the
question
where
if
the
patents
are
not
relied
on
as
a
defense,
whether
the
government
can
challenge
them
nonetheless
if
they
are
involved
in
antitrust
violation.
and
then
i
come
to
the
one,
but
i
just
want
to
say
here
at
the
exhibit,
basically,
we
don’t
think
they
make
any
convincing
policy
arguments
as
to
why
the
government
should
not
be
able
to
do
this.
their
major
argument
and
indeed
the
principal
reliance
of
the
court
--
district
court
was
on
this
court’s
decision
in
the
bell
telephone
case,
75
years
ago.
the
bell
telephone
case
was
suit
in
which
the
government
challenged
certain
of
the
bell
telephone
patents
as
having
been
obtained
by
fraud
on
the
patent
office
by
alleged
misrepresentations,
and
we
thus
brought
a
suit
to
cancel
the
patents.
the
circuit
court
held
that
the
government
had
not
proven
fraud
and
dismissed
the
suit
and
this
court
affirmed
the
dismissal
saying
that
the
whole
theory
of
the
government
that
these
people
had
failed
to
move
with
sufficient
dispatch
before
the
patent
office
and
that
therefore
they
were
extending
the
life
of
the
patent
and
the
protection
of
the
patent.
they
said
that
is
not
fraud
within
the
rule
that
permits
the
government
to
challenge
a
patentee
for
--
to
cancel
a
patent
for
fraud.
and
then
the
court
went
on
and
commented
on
a
statement
made
in
an
earlier
decision
involving
the
bell
case,
which
it
suggested
that
the
government
could
also
perhaps
challenge
a
patent
for
mistake
on
the
part
of
the
patent
officials,
their
judgment,
and
so
on,
and
--
what
the
court
said
was
that,
“in
making
the
statement
of
the
earlier
case,
it
was
not
intending
to
suggest
or
state
that.”
and
this
is
the
quotation,
“the
courts
of
the
united
states
sitting
as
courts
of
equity
could
entertain
jurisdiction
of
a
suit
by
the
united
states
to
set
aside
a
patent
for
an
invention
on
the
mere
ground
of
error
of
judgment
on
the
part
of
the
patent
officials.
that
would
be
an
attempt
on
the
part
of
the
courts
in
collateral
attack
to
exercise
an
appellate
jurisdiction
over
the
decisions
of
the
patent
office,
although
no
appellate
jurisdiction
has
been
by
the
statutes
conferred.”
now,
to
begin
with,
the
rationale
that
was
announced
in
the
bell
telephone
case
that
permitting
the
government
to
maintain
such
a
suit
would
amount
to
an
impermissible
collateral
attack
on
the
patent
office.
that
is
the
identical
theory
upon
which
the
district
court
in
gypsum
refused
to
permit
the
government
to
challenge
the
patent.
and
one
which
we
think
this
court
implicitly
rejected
in
its
gypsum
decision.
and,
of
course,
as
a
practical
matter,
patents
are
challenged
and
the
decisions
of
the
patent
commissioner
are
reviewed
all
the
time
in
the
courts
of
this
country.
and
what
happens
is
whenever
there
is
a
patent
suit
and
the
patent
is
challenged,
the
district
court
in
determining
whether
the
patent
is
valid
or
invalid
to
that
extent
reviews
the
decision
of
the
commissioner
of
patents.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
but
i
am
suggesting
mr.
justice
that
the
fact
that
the
court
is
in
effect
reviewing
the
decision
of
the
patent
commissioner.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
but
we
think
this
is
an
appropriate
ancillary
phase
of
the
case.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
think
it
is
pendent
to
the
antitrust.
i
think
under
the
section
4
of
the
sherman
act,
the
jurisdiction,
the
jurisdiction
of
the
district
court
embraces
anything
that
is
ancillary
and
in
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
perhaps
under
other
sections,
but
not
on
the
--
i
wouldn’t
think
under
section
4
of
the
sherman
act,
under
the
other
provisions
dealing
with
it.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
we
don’t
say
that
the
mere
practice
of
an
invalid
patent
itself
is
a
violation
of
the
sherman
act.
what
we
do
say
is
there
have
to
be
more
than
that
to
be
a
violation
of
the
sherman
act,
and
i
assume
your
hypothetical
was
that
all
we
had
was
just
a
naked
suit
challenging
a
patent.
we
wouldn’t
say
that
there
is
jurisdiction
to
deal
with
that
under
the
sherman
act.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
i
would
suggest
two
sections,
mr.
justice.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
one
is
1338
(a),
the
original
jurisdiction
of
any
civil
action
arising
under
any
act
of
congress
relating
to
patents
and
then
also
the
section
where
the
united
states
is
the
plaintiff
in
the
suit.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
whether
the
government
has
standing
to
challenge
a
patent
involved
in
an
antitrust
violation
where
there
is
no
claim
of
fraud
on
the
patent
office
and
where
the
patent
is
not
relied
on
as
a
defense.
that’s
the
case
that
we
have
put
to
the
court.
now
of
course
the
other
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
we
think
not
mr.
justice
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
but
then
--
and
then
they
went
on
to
say
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
but
the
court
went
on
and
did
decide.
the
court
went
on
and
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
no,
i
am
sorry.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
but
of
course
in
the
gypsum
case,
we
were
challenging
the
validity
of
the
patent
only
because
the
defendants
were
relying
on
it,
whereas
in
this
case,
they
are
not
relying
on
it,
and
we
are
challenging
the
patent
that's
incidental
to
antitrust
violation.
now
if
i
may
come
to
two
other
respects
in
which
i
think
the
bell
case
is
quite
different.
first
of
all,
the
statement
in
the
bell
case
of
course
was
not
necessary
to
the
decision
in
the
case
because
the
actual
holding
in
the
case
was
that
the
government
had
not
proved
fraud.
secondly
and
more
importantly,
the
bell
case
was
decided
only
seven
years
after
the
sherman
act
was
passed.
there
is
no
reference
in
the
opinion
in
the
bell
case
to
the
sherman
act
and
again,
the
bell
case
did
not
involve
any
challenge
to
a
patent
in
connection
with
an
antitrust
suit.
it
was
a
naked
challenge
to
the
patent
and
the
court
said
that
in
a
naked
challenge
to
the
patent
by
the
government
where
the
government
challenge
is
to
fraud
in
fact,
that
it
cannot
challenge
is
just
on
the
ground
of
a
mistake
on
the
part
of
the
patent
office.
and
we
think
that
in
the
light
of
the
more
recent
decisions
of
this
court,
dealing,
giving
broader
rights
to
challenge
patents
and
the
right
of
its
repeated
statements
of
the
importance
of
permitting
authoritative
testing
of
patents.
if
bell
is
read
as
precluding,
the
government’s
challenge
to
the
patent
in
this
situation,
we
then
suggest
that
bell
should
be
reexamined
and
rejected
to
that
extent.
i
would
now
like
to
turn
to
the
other
phase
of
this
case
which
is
the
relief
aspects,
and
what
we
think
is
the
court
erred
in
failing
to
grant
us
these
two
additional
items
of
relief,
that
is
to
require
the
appellees
to
sell
in
bulk
and
to
give
reasonable
patent
license
royalties.
this
court
has
many
times
specified
the
purposes
of
antitrust
relief
to
cure
the
ill
effects
of
the
illegal
conduct
and
protect
the
public
from
its
continuation.
it
has
said
that
the
relief
must
be
affected
to
restore
competition
and
in
a
much
quoted
statement
from
the
international
salt
case
that
it
should
pry
open
to
competition
a
market
that
has
been
closed
by
the
defendant’s
illegal
restraints.
now
of
course,
the
district
court
has
brought
discretion
in
framing
relief
in
antitrust
cases,
but
this
court
again
has
pointed
out
that
it
has
never
hesitated
to
step
in
what
is
described
as
perhaps
the
most
critical
aspect
of
the
antitrust
case
to
take
whatever
steps
are
necessary
to
ensure
that
the
relief
is
adequate.
now,
while
the
bulk
sales
prohibition
was
in
effect,
there
were
no
sales
of
this
product
in
bulk
in
the
united
states.
the
three
licensees
had
all
of
the
market
and
as
would
be
expected
in
this
kind
of
a
situation,
the
other
prices
were
virtually
identical.
we
have
figures
in
the
record
showing
them
prices
charged
by
the
three
licensees
at
wholesale
to
the
druggists.
on
the
regular
size
of
the
capsule,
the
prices
were
identical
of
all
three
of
the
licensees,
$10.40
for
a
bottle
of
100
capsules
in
the
most
popular
size.
in
the
micro-size
type
of
drug
which
as
i
indicated
is
the
most
popular
at
the
moment,
there
were
micro-size
variations
in
the
prices,
one
of
them
charged
$12.14,
the
other
$12.10
and
the
other
third
one,
$12.04,
once
again,
substantially
identical
prices.
the
three
licensees
are
three
of
the
major
drug
firms
in
this
country.
they
sell
drugs
under
well
known
trademark
names.
they
advertise
extensively.
they
engage,
as
we
all
know,
in
very
extensive
promotion.
there
are
several
small
firms
in
the
drug
business
who
are
so
called
generic
drug
manufacturers.
they
sell
the
same
product
under
the
generic
name
or
under
their
own
name
which
is
not
well
advertised.
these
firms
compete
on
price.
they
do
not
have
the
big
name
brand,
but
they
are
able
to
sell
the
drug
cheaper
and
many
people
are
willing
to
accept
the
non-named
brand
for
a
lesser
price.
and
the
evidence
in
this
case
is
that
for
the
generic
distributor
to
be
able
to
compete
effectively
with
the
brand
name
on
a
product
like
this
griseofulvin,
they
have
to
sell
it
about
two
thirds
the
price
that
the
brand
name
charges.
there
is
also
indication
that
several
of
these
drug
manufacturers
are
very
interested
in
going
into
the
griseofulvin
business.
after
the
appellees
had
canceled,
shortly
after
the
time
the
suit
was
brought,
the
restriction
on
bulk
sales,
american
home
products
offered
both
bulk
griseofulvin
and
the
capsule
form
in
this
country.
but
the
testimony
is
that
they
offered
it
at
prices
to
these
generic
manufacturers
at
which
the
later
could
not
effectively
compete
in
the
market.
for
example,
ici
charged
its
licensee,
american
home
$78
a
kilogram
for
bulk
griseofulvin.
ici
in
turn
offered
the
same
bulk
product
to
these
generic
firms
at
prices
ranging
from
$118
to
a
$141
a
kilogram.
it's
hardly
surprising
that
the
other
firms
beside
the
licensees
were
not
interested
in
purchasing
and
could
not
do
so
economically.
now
american
home
products
also
offered
capsules
and
once
again,
statements
by
two
of
the
generic
manufacturers
stated
that
they
couldn't
compete
effectively
with
american
home
products
at
the
prices
american
home
was
quoting
to
them,
which
presumably
was
a
price
at
which
american
home
would
make
a
profit.
two
of
them
did
buy
some
capsules.
now
once
more
firm
bought
a
million
capsules
for
distribution
in
order
that
came
to
about
$46,000
and
after
they
had
finished
distributing
with
all
their
marketing
and
distribution
cost,
they
discovered
that
they
were
losing
$2.30
on
very
bottle
they
sold.
and
when
american
home
products
refused
to
reduce
the
price,
of
course,
they
stopped
any
broad
scale
promotion
of
griseofulvin.
the
$2.30
figure
is
contained
in
the
statement
at
page
228
of
the
record.
now
this
evidence
as
to
what
happened
after
the
parties
terminated
their
bulk
sales
restrictions,
demonstrates
to
us
that
an
order
of
the
district
court
merely
prohibiting
the
restraint
of
both
sales
isn't
going
to
have
any
effect
at
all
in
restoring
competition
in
this
market.
all
that
order
would
do
would
be
to
continue
by
judicial
decree
of
what
the
parties
have
been
doing
up
till
that
time.
there
is
no
reason
to
think
that
if
all
we
have
in
this
case
is
an
order
directing
the
appellees
to
stop
prohibiting
bulk
sales
that
there
is
going
to
be
any
change
in
this
market,
why
should
the
appellees
now
decide
to
permit
the
various
competitors
to
come
into
the
market?
there
is
no
reason
why
because
this
market
has
continued
for
10
or
12
years
in
a
concentrated
noncompetitive
situation
and
there
is
no
reason
on
earth
why
unless
they
are
required
to
do
something
more
than
what
has
been
done
that
there
is
going
to
be
any
competition.
the
appellees
have
been
selling
at,
one
of
them,
glaxo
at
$60
a
kilogram,
ici
at
$78
a
kilogram
for
many
years.
there
is
no
reason
to
think
that
they
are
not
profiting
in
this
business
and
we
see
no
reason
why
they
shouldn't
also
be
ordered
to
sell
and
to
offer
this
product
to
the
other
people
in
the
united
states
who
want
to
enter
the
market.
we
want
to
make
it
very
clear
and
in
our
proposed
judgment,
all
that
we
are
saying
is
that
if
they
continue
to
sell
in
this
country,
if
they
continue
to
sell
in
this
country,
they
have
to
offer
the
product
to
all
on
non
--
at
a
nondiscriminatory
level
and
we
think
this
is
what
is
required
in
order
to
inject
some
competition
into
this
market.
and
when
i
say
inject
some
competition,
frequently
the
relief
is
framed
in
terms
of
to
restore
competition,
to
restore
the
status
quo.
in
this
case,
there
is
nothing
to
restore
because
there
has
never
been
any
competition
in
this
market.
this
market
started
on
a
noncompetitive
concentrated
basis
and
that's
the
way
it's
continued.
we
also
are
urging
that
there
should
be
compulsory
licensing
of
patents
at
reasonable
royalties.
we
have
covered
that
fully
in
our
brief
and
i
would
then
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
thank
you.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
we
think
that
this
patent
--
inevitably
this
patent
most
assuredly
was
involved
in
these
violations.
we
think
the
patent
in
a
very
real
sense
was
the
whole
key
to
these
violations
because
without
the
power
of
the
patents,
these
firms
could
not
have
been
able
to
impose
these
bulk
sales
restrictions.
and
when
mr.
timberg
talks
about
the
pooling
arrangement
that
this
was
just
designed
to
correct
any
problem
in
the
united
kingdom
where
they
had
to
cross-license.
the
fact
is
that
in
addition
to
the
pooling
of
the
patents,
glaxo
saw
fit
and
feel
it
necessary
in
that
agreement
to
prohibit
ici
from
permitting
its
licensees
to
sell
in
bulk.
so,
obviously
it
was
not
just
something
that
this
people
added,
this
bulk
thing
has
an
afterthought,
the
patent
license
was
all
tied
in
with
the
bulk
situation.
and
i
would
like
to
invite
the
court's
attention
to
a
document
on
page
86
of
the
record
in
which
a
man
from
ici
was
discussing
with
someone
from
squibb,
not
one
of
the
licensees,
their
interest
in
griseofulvin.
and
what
this
man
said
was
i
gave
mr.
dow
(ph)
that
is
of
ici
some
idea
of
the
patent
situation
on
griseofulvin
in
such
form
as
will
i
hope
have
impressed
upon
him
the
impossibility
of
squibb
trading
in
griseofulvin
without
a
license
from
glaxo
under
the
ici
and
glaxo
patents.
in
other
words,
this
whole
market
was
tied
up.
the
whole
market
was
kept
free
from
any
competition
because
of
these
patents
and
that's
why
we
think
these
patents
are
involved
in
the
violation.
the
leverage
of
the
patents,
the
power
of
the
patents
was
an
important
element
in
effecting
the
violation.
now
mr.
sailer
has
said
that
our
argument
that
the
licensees'
self-interest
will
lead
them
to
continue
the
existing
situation
proves
too
much
because
it
says
that
proves
then
even
had
there
not
been
these
restraints.
nevertheless,
the
licensees
independently
would
have
reached
the
same
result.
but
the
self-interest
we're
talking
about
now
is
their
self-interest
in
continuing
the
existing
situation
and
with
respect
to
the
claim
that
the
appellees
have
sold
so
little
--
i
am
sorry,
the
licensees
have
in
affect
been
de
minimis
in
selling
other
drugs
in
bulk
and
therefore
its
a
reasonable
assumption
they
wouldn't
have
sold
these
drugs
in
bulk.
mr.
sailer
referred
to
statistics
shown
in
1969,
ici
sold
only
oh,
$8000-10,000
worth
of
drugs.
the
documents
are
contained
at
pages
239-244
of
the
record.
in
earlier
years
for
example,
in
1961
ici
sold
better
than
$200,000
worth
of
the
drugs
and
if
you
look
through
these
particular
things
in
1962,
ici
sold
$223,000
of
this
drug
and
one
other
fact,
there
is
also
in
the
record
at
234,
i
am
sorry
243-244
which
shows
bulk
sales
by
the
schering
corporation
of
other
drugs.
and
in
a
period
of
10
years,
this
firm
sold
approximately
11
million
dollars
in
bulk
other
than
griseofulvin.
in
the
face
of
that,
we
think
that
it
cannot
be
said
that
if
it
had
not
been
for
these
restrictions
in
the
bulk
sales,
they
nevertheless
would
have
accomplished
the
same
objective.
we
don't
know.
we
do
know
there
were
these
restrictions,
we
do
know
that
the
market
filing
this
restrictions
is
noncompetitive
and
we
think
appropriate
relief
is
to
make
it
competitive
for
the
first
time.
and
mr.
chief
justice,
i
have
misspoke
myself
at
one
point
where
i
said,
ici
and
i
meant
american
home
products.
mr.
sailer
is
properly
correct.
