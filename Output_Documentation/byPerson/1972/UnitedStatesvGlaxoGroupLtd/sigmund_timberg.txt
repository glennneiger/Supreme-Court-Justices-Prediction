mr.
sigmund
timberg
mr.
chief
justice
and
if
the
court
please.
i
should
like
to
open
by
describing
the
antitrust
violation
in
this
case
as
found
by
the
court
below,
because
i
think
it
is
crucial
to
both
of
the
issues
raised
on
this
appeal.
my
client,
imperial
chemical
industries
is
a
british
company
that
was
developing
drugs
in
its
uk
laboratories
that
it
considered
suitable
for
the
u.s.
market.
these
drugs
were
too
few
to
justify
in
developing
its
own
organization
in
the
united
states.
so
in
1958,
it
entered
into
an
elaborate
exclusive
distributorship
agreement
with
a
u.s.
concern,
amho
or
american
home
products
under
which
ici
exported
the
drugs
fob
uk
port
and
amho
took
title
to
the
drug
which
it
processed
and
sold
in
dosage
form
on
the
u.s.
market.
that
agreement
has
never
been
challenged
in
this
litigation.
ici’s
antitrust
violation
did
consist
of
a
single
clause
in
a
later
1962
agreement,
dealing
only
with
the
antibiotic
griseofulvin
which
provided
that
amho,
it's
distributor
or
not
resale
the
griseofulvin
in
bulk
without
ici’s
permission.
this
clause
was
a
routine
carryover
from
ici’s
many
international
drug
agreements
perhaps
involving
a
hundred
countries.
its
purpose
was
found
by
the
court
to
be,
to
ensure
a
proper
worldwide
medical
standards
for
the
drugs
use
and
preparation.
however,
the
district
court
found
that
it's
effect
to
be
to
reserve
in
ici
the
power
to
control
the
conditions
under
which
the
bulk
drug
might
be
used
up.
applying
this
court’s
then
recent
decision
in
the
schwinn
case,
the
district
court
held
the
clause
to
be
an
illegal
restraint
on
alienation
violating
section
1
of
the
sherman
act.
the
government
did
not
charge
and
the
court
did
not
hold
that
there
was
any
monopolization
under
section
2
of
the
act.
the
record
shows
that
this
inadvertent
restraint
on
alienation
was
canceled
by
ici
more
than
five
years
ago,
only
four
months
after
the
schwinn
decision
which
the
district
court
characterized
as
unpredictable,
this
is
not
my
characterization
and
four
months
before
the
complaint
in
this
case
was
filed.
moreover,
the
restraint
had
no
effect
on
competition
in
the
marketplace.
for
ici’s
reserved
power
was
never
exercised.
no
request
was
ever
made
to
ici
or
to
amho
for
bulk
griseofulvin
for
use
on
the
u.s.
commercial
market,
pages
14-15
of
our
brief
sets
forth
the
situation.
in
depositions
taken
by
the
government,
the
offices
of
one
large
and
one
small
drug
firm
testified
that
they
considered
the
u.s
griseofulvin
market
too
small,
too
competitive,
and
unattractive
for
entry.
that
market
by
the
way
had
shrunk
by
one-sixth
during
the
two-year
period,
1967-1969
from
about
8
million
dollars
retail
sales
annually
to
6.7
million
dollars.
by
their
own
affidavits,
none
of
the
independents
who
the
government
claims
were
denied
access
to
bulk
griseofulvin
showed
any
interest
in
the
drug
until
one
year
after
the
restriction
was
canceled.
considering
the
limited
operations
and
resources,
these
independents
in
fact
could
not
have
engaged
in
the
expensive
and
extended
clinical
and
toxicological
testing
as
necessary
to
obtain
food
and
drug
administration
approval
for
the
drug
which
we
describe
on
page
13
of
our
brief.
nor
could
they
have
sustained
a
heavy
laboratory
operating
and
promotional
expenses
involved
in
launching
the
product
on
a
national
market
with
appropriate
medical
safeguards.
the
record
therefore
i
submit
to
your
honors,
abundantly
supports
the
district
court’s
central
finding
on
relief
which
was
that
the
evidence
did
not
show
that
a
current
monopoly
condition
exists
as
a
result
of
the
bulk
resale
restriction.
absent
such
an
effect
or
result
and
such
a
condition
there
is
as
we
show
in
our
brief
no
legal
basis
for
a
compulsory
sale
and
compulsory
patent
licensing
relief
requested
by
the
government.
before
leaving
the
rest
of
the
subject
of
relief
to
our
brief
because
i
do
want
to
address
myself
to
the
second
issue
on
this
appeal,
i
should
like
to
point
out
one,
just
one
fact.
a
compulsory
sale
requirement
in
this
case
would
involve
ici
in
a
breach
of
its
binding
contractual
relationship
to
its
distributor
amho,
a
party
not
before
this
court.
this
is
unfair
we
think
to
amho
who
has
large
scale
expenditures
and
efforts
both
in
obtaining
the
food
and
drug
administration
approval
for
the
drug
and
launching
it
on
the
u.s
market
has
built
up
such
a
u.s
market
as
there
is
for
ici’s
$200,000-300,000
worth
of
annual
griseofulvin
exports
from
the
uk.
if
i
may,
i
should
like
to
address
myself
to
the
patents
and
validity
issue
and
on
this
connection,
i
wish
to
make
two
preliminary
points.
first,
the
ici
patent
is
not
a
worthless
and
specious
patent.
it
embodies
as
we
point
out
in
our
brief
on
pages
12
and
13
a
true
invention.
the
efficacy
of
the
drug
was
conceded
by
the
government
and
its
novelty
is
attested
to
by
the
medical
literature
to
which
we
refer
in
our
brief.
it
is
not
being
attacked
for
lack
of
patentability
and
also
lack
of
novelty
or
utility.
it
is
being
attacked
for
two
alleged
errors
of
judgment
by
the
patent
office
in
the
allowance
of
patent
claims,
mr.
friedman
has
described
to
you.
the
question
is,
is
the
possibility
of
correcting
such
errors
sufficient
justification
for
prolonging
into
an
indefinite
future
an
antitrust
litigation,
the
antitrust
aspects
of
which
have
been
concluded
after
five
painful
years.
second,
the
district
court
held
that
neither
ici
nor
the
glaxo
patent
had
been
abused.
yet
the
attorney
general
is
asking
for
broader
relief,
the
complete
invalidation
of
the
patent
then
a
private
defendant
and
a
patent
infringement
suit
could
obtained,
where
patent
misuse
had
been
abundantly
demonstrated.
on
pages
4-5
of
the
government's
reply
brief,
they
do
refer
to
the
morton
salt
and
empsall
(ph)
cases
which
still
establish
a
doctrine
of
patent
misuse.
but
i
must,
i
should
remind
the
court
that
this
court
has
held,
that
the
defendant
there
is
only
entitled
to
a
stay
of
the
infringement
suit
until
the
improper
practice
has
been
abandoned
whatever
that
might
be
in
our
case
and
the
consequences
of
a
misuse
of
the
patent
have
been
dissipated.
now
your
honors,
we
learned
for
the
first
time
from
the
government's
reply
brief
and
from
mr.
friedman’s
colloquy,
i
believe
it
was
with
mr.
justice
white
that
the
government’s
position
is
that
in
an
antitrust
controversy,
pendent
jurisdiction
of
a
patent
invalidity
claim
maybe
asserted.
this
is
my
apology
for
bringing
up
a
case
which
i
have
communicated
to
mr.
friedman.
it's
the
case
of
united
mine
workers
v.
gibbs,
383
u.s.
715.
this
case
teaches
us
that
for
pendent
jurisdiction
to
apply,
the
main
antitrust
claim
and
the
pendent
patent
invalidity
claim
must
derive
from
a
common
nucleus
of
operative
facts.
it
is
clear
that
the
factual
issues
relevant
to
the
alleged
errors
of
the
patent
office
and
its
allowance
to
the
ici
patent
claim
which
are
set
forth
on
pages
25
of
our
brief
and
to
which
i
refer
the
court
to
pages
437-450
of
the
appendix
have
nothing
in
common
with
the
factual
issues
involved
in
the
antitrust
action.
mr.
sailer
has
pointed
out
that
the
patent
invalidity
has
no
bearing
either
on
the
issue
of
the
antitrust
liability
or
on
the
issue
of
antitrust
relief.
on
pages
30-31
of
our
brief
we
indicate
that
compulsory
patent
licensing
relief
is
available
in
the
antitrust
cases
whenever
the
patent
poses
an
illegal
barrier
of
competition.
in
fact,
as
far
as
this
case
is
concerned
my
client
by
way
of
implementing
its
hands
off
policies
as
far
as
the
u.s.
market
is
concerned
has
made
its
patent
generally
available
for
licensing
and
has
granted
licenses
to
five
independents
on
reasonable
terms,
two
of
which
have
already
published
--
purchased
griseofulvin
from
amho,
its
distributor
and
amho,
i
should
also
point
out
as
the
record
shows
has
offered
to
make
bulk
griseofulvin
available
on
reasonable
terms
in
at
least
15
different
cases.
this
was
in
the
short
period
of
time
before
the
record
of
the
case
closed.
furthermore,
as
stated
in
gibbs,
pendent
jurisdiction
is
a
doctrine
of
judicial
discretion
justified
by
considerations
of
judicial
economy,
convenience
and
fairness
to
the
litigants.
the
challenge
of
patent
validity
supported
by
the
attorney
general
flies
in
the
face
we
think
of
these
considerations.
as
this
court
pointed
out
in
blonder-tongue,
it
would
needlessly
promote
protected
and
expensive
litigation.
it
expands
the
already
crowded
dockets
of
the
district
courts.
under
the
expediting
act,
this
court
would
have
to
review
such
extraneous
patent
validity
determinations
directly
from
the
district
court
without
the
helpful
assistance
of
the
circuit
courts
of
appeal.
also,
speaking
from
the
patentee
standpoint,
such
challenges
are
unfair
to
the
patentee.
he
is
entitled
to
assume
until
congress
has
spoken
to
the
contrary
that
the
action
of
the
patent
office
in
granting
the
patents
is
not
be
independently
challenged
by
one
or
two
lawyers
in
the
justice
department,
however
gifted
their
powers
of
analysis
maybe.
finally,
from
the
added
aspect
of
sherman
and
antitrust
enforcement,
these
challenges
and
this
would
be
academic
in
purpose,
those
exercises
that
would
operate
wastefully
to
divert
the
time,
money
and
resources
on
prosecutions.
a
word
about
the
legal
issues
in
the
case,
we
do
of
course
think
that
public
policy
considerations
do
favor
the
affirmance
of
the
district
court's
ruling,
but
they
determine
that
the
issue
was
illegal
one
that
goes
to
the
heart
of
our
constitution
system
of
separation
of
powers.
has
congress
in
fact,
authorized
the
courts
to
entertain
this
kind
of
challenge
of
patent
validity.
as
this
court
said
in
simpson
v.
union
oil,
congress
is
the
arbiter
of
the
public
interest.
thus,
even
with
a
more
effective
enforcement
of
sherman
act
was
at
stake,
this
court
has
been
unwilling
to
confer
on
private
parties,
a
remedy
that
had
not
been
prescribed
by
congress.
that
was
the
case
of
kelly
versus
kosuga,
it's
cited
on
our
brief.
similarly,
it
has
been
unwilling
to
confer
on
the
attorney
general
a
remedy
that
has
not
been
prescribed
by
congress
and
that
is
the
cooper
case
referred
to
in
our
brief.
as
this
court
said
in
the
cooper
case,
it
is
not
the
function
of
the
courts
to
engraft
on
the
statute
additions
which
they
think
the
legislature
logically
might
or
should
have
made.
the
rule
of
the
bell
case
has
been
stated
and
we
say
only
that
it
is
more
than
a
sound
rule
of
decision.
it
reflects
to
us
a
constitution
imperative.
for
the
courts
to
try
issues
of
patent
validity
without
congressional
authorization
involves
a
negation
we
think
of
two
basic
powers
conferred
by
the
constitution
on
the
congress.
one
of
these
is
the
plenary
power
of
congress
to
legislate
on
the
subject
of
patents.
the
other
is
the
exclusive
congressional
power
to
prescribe
the
jurisdiction
of
the
federal
courts,
including
the
jurisdiction
to
review
administrative
decisions
such
as
those
made
by
the
patent
office
in
this
case.
now,
in
the
exercise
of
this
patent
power,
congress
has
paid
particular
and
continuing
attention
to
the
administrative
procedures
for
examining
and
reviewing
patents
within
the
patent
office
and
its
predecessor
agencies
and
the
judicial
procedures
for
reviewing
these
administrative
determinations.
we
cite
on
page
36
of
our
brief,
12
such
cases
where
the
congress
has
amended
the
patent
code.
despite
this
meticulous
and
specific
supervision
by
the
congress
the
patent
code
contains
no
provision
conferring
this
authority
on
the
attorney
general
to
initiate
in
the
courts
the
kind
of
challenge
of
patent
validity
involved
in
this
case.
we
also
refer
in
footnote
42
of
our
brief
to
several
proposals
that
have
been
made
giving
the
attorney
general
and
other
persons
the
right
to
collaterally
challenge
patent
validity.
none
of
these
has
ever
been
reported
out
by
congressional
committee
and
it
is
significant
that
the
impact
of
these
proposals
is
that
the
challenger
must
sue
to
cancel
or
revoke
the
patent
in
the
patent
office
first
before
seeking
review
in
the
courts
and
it
is
submitted
that
perhaps
this
is
maybe
a
logical
method
of
procedure
rather
than
the
procedure
supported
by
the
government.
mr.
sigmund
timberg
it
is
indeed
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
it
has
been
in
the
statute
i
think
since
1870.
the
right
of
a
person
sued
for
patent
infringement
to
defend
case
is,
i
think
it's
in
the
statute.
yes
he
may
specifically
defend
on
the
purpose
--
on
the
grounds
of
invalidity.
i
don't
think
that's
going
to
be
contested.
in
fact,
i
don't
think
the
government
has
pointed
for
all
of
its
analogies
to
--
mr.
sigmund
timberg
it's
35,
my
colleague
informs
me,
it's
35
u.s.c.
282
confers
that
right.
mr.
sigmund
timberg
yes
and
that
was
along
the
same
line
of
reasoning,
that
like
to
the
gypsum
case.
in
other
words,
if
the
royalties
are
predicated
upon
an
illegal
agreement
and
it
is
a
private
and
the
illegality
--
mr.
sigmund
timberg
i
assume
under
lear
v.
adkins,
if
that
is
the
case
your
honor
is
referring
to,
it
would
be
able
to
challenge
patent.
mr.
sigmund
timberg
it's
predicated
on
something
else,
yes
your
honor.
i
would
like
to,
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
would
like
to
--
mr.
sigmund
timberg
yes.
mr.
sigmund
timberg
it's
based
ultimately
on
statute,
if
i
may
say
a
word
mr.
justice
blackmun
on
the
question
of
gypsum.
in
our
view
gypsum
confirms
the
bell
case
and
underscores
a
paramount
authority
of
the
congress
to
prescribe
the
jurisdiction
of
the
courts
and
the
authority
of
the
attorney
general.
in
enacting
the
sherman
act,
congress
did
confer
jurisdiction
on
the
federal
courts
to
entertain
antitrust
suits
that
were
brought
by
the
attorney
general.
there
was
a
possibility
in
gypsum
that
the
defendants
would
rely
on
patents
of
defense
to
a
charge
of
illegal
price
fixing.
hence
if
the
attorney
general
will
not
give
them
the
opportunity
to
show
patent
invalidity
and
that
the
asserted
shield
of
patentability
does
not
exist,
the
congressional
grant
of
jurisdiction
to
enforce
the
sherman
act
would
be
frustrated.
and
this
i
think
is
the
theme
that
i
would
suggest,
reconciles
gypsum
with
the
questions
that
both
of
your
honors
have
been
asking.
we
say
that
if
the
jurisdiction
of
the
sherman
act
would
be
frustrated
and
such
similar
situation
was
involved
in
the
walker
process
equipment
case,
yes,
in
those
cases
the
court
may
reach
to
a
patent
invalidity
defense,
but
what
the
government
is
doing
in
this
case
is
independently
of
raising
it
as
a
defense,
they
are
collaterally
in
their
complaint
attacking
patent
invalidity
in
a
situation
that
has
nothing
at
all
to
do
with
the
policy
of
the
antitrust
laws.
mr.
sigmund
timberg
it's
in
fact
that
were
alleged
to
be
the
leverage
that
made
the
restraint
possible
then
this
would
--
that
might
be
so,
but
this
is
not
that
case
your
honor.
this
is
a
situation
where
the
leverage
that
might
have
made
the
restraint
possible
was
the
fact
that
two
persons
control
the
manufacture
of
this
commodity
which
is
indeed
an
expensive
commodity.
mr.
sigmund
timberg
they
also
had
patents
may
i
say
and
they
also
cross-license
the
patents,
but
the
reason
that
they
cross-licensed
the
patents
through
each
other
was
that
they
were
blocking
patents.
they
couldn't
even
get
going
in
the
united
kingdom,
on
the
manufacture
of
the
griseofulvin
unless
they
cross-licensed
to
each
other.
mr.
sigmund
timberg
the
pool
couldn't
be
dissolved.
the
pool
that
was
really
a
settlement
of
conflicting
patent
rights
because
none
of
the
three
distributors
in
the
united
states
could
even
have
gotten
on
the
market
unless
they
had
access
to
ici’s
dosage
pack
which
as
mr.
sailer
has
pointed
out
was
the
only
patent
in
the
field
until
september
1967
when
the
glaxo
patent
came
in.
but
the
situation
in
england
was
much
more
complicated
than
that
and
i
would
want
your
honors
to
bear
in
mind
that
the
1960
agreement
which
the
government
has
referred
to
was
an
agreement
that
had
worldwide
implications.
it
was
i
think
agreement
between
two
british
companies.
it
wasn't
specifically
directed
against
the
u.s.
market
and
the
particular
provision
in
the
1960
agreement,
a
good
faith
provision
that
ici
imposed
this
restriction
on
its
distributor
was
something
that
was
found
illegal
only
to
the
extent
that
it
affected
the
u.s.
vendees
of
ici
which
was
just
our
exclusive
distributor
amho.
so
that
unless
this
court
is
going
to
say
that
it's
never
possible
for
people
who
have
blocking
patents
to,
like
cross-license
each
other
under
those
patents
and
that
they
must
automatically
license
the
world.
this
the
government’s
claim
for
a
licensing
in
this
case
is
not
i
think
one
that
is
warranted.
that
the
power
--
the
patent
was
not
used
to
--
was
not
used
to
stop
anybody
from
selling
griseofulvin
in
this
country.
the
only
antitrust
violation
was
the
restraint
on
alienation
which
was
canceled.
in
our
case,
the
patent
licensing
--
mr.
sigmund
timberg
if
the
patent,
if
the
--
well,
if
it
had
not
been
canceled
then
there
might
the
possibility
of
the
government
urging
that
the
dosage
patent
be
made
available
on
a
royalty
free
basis
--
excuse
me,
reasonable
royalty
basis
to
all
applicants
which
is
within
the
discretion
of
the
district
court.
mr.
sigmund
timberg
it
is
a
question
of
remedy,
pure
and
simple,
your
honor.
mr.
sigmund
timberg
it
is
a
remedy
question
but
i
get
back
to
the
reason
why
i
cited
kelly
and
kosuga
and
the
cooper
case,
it
is
if
you
want
to
call
it
a
remedy
you
may.
but
it
is
a
type
of
remedy
which
we
believe
should
be
authorized
by
the
congress
which
has
authorized
all
sorts
of
remedies
in
this
situation.
that
is
our
feeling
with
respect
to
this.
i
don't
think
--
the
only
other
ground
that
the
government
asserted
in
connection
with
jurisdiction
was
the
inherent
equity
jurisdiction
ground,
that
was
what
the
only
ground
we
thought
they
argued
in
the
district
court
and
in
our
brief
we
have
indicated
the
irrelevance
of
the
five
cases
cited
by
the
attorney
general
supporting
this
inherent
equity
jurisdiction.
none
of
them
involve
patents.
only
one
of
them
decided
in
1888
involved
the
judicial
review
of
an
administrative
determination
and
we
agree
with
the
result
in
that
case
because
we
do
believe
that
the
district
court
does
have
the
right
to
inherently
to
look
into
patents
obtained
by
fraud.
we
therefore
conclude
that
the
district
court
acted
wisely
and
correctly
and
urge
that
its
judgment
be
affirmed.
mr.
sigmund
timberg
mr.
chief
justice
and
if
the
court
please.
i
should
like
to
open
by
describing
the
antitrust
violation
in
this
case
as
found
by
the
court
below,
because
i
think
it
is
crucial
to
both
of
the
issues
raised
on
this
appeal.
my
client,
imperial
chemical
industries
is
a
british
company
that
was
developing
drugs
in
its
uk
laboratories
that
it
considered
suitable
for
the
u.s.
market.
these
drugs
were
too
few
to
justify
in
developing
its
own
organization
in
the
united
states.
so
in
1958,
it
entered
into
an
elaborate
exclusive
distributorship
agreement
with
a
u.s.
concern,
amho
or
american
home
products
under
which
ici
exported
the
drugs
fob
uk
port
and
amho
took
title
to
the
drug
which
it
processed
and
sold
in
dosage
form
on
the
u.s.
market.
that
agreement
has
never
been
challenged
in
this
litigation.
ici’s
antitrust
violation
did
consist
of
a
single
clause
in
a
later
1962
agreement,
dealing
only
with
the
antibiotic
griseofulvin
which
provided
that
amho,
it's
distributor
or
not
resale
the
griseofulvin
in
bulk
without
ici’s
permission.
this
clause
was
a
routine
carryover
from
ici’s
many
international
drug
agreements
perhaps
involving
a
hundred
countries.
its
purpose
was
found
by
the
court
to
be,
to
ensure
a
proper
worldwide
medical
standards
for
the
drugs
use
and
preparation.
however,
the
district
court
found
that
it's
effect
to
be
to
reserve
in
ici
the
power
to
control
the
conditions
under
which
the
bulk
drug
might
be
used
up.
applying
this
court’s
then
recent
decision
in
the
schwinn
case,
the
district
court
held
the
clause
to
be
an
illegal
restraint
on
alienation
violating
section
1
of
the
sherman
act.
the
government
did
not
charge
and
the
court
did
not
hold
that
there
was
any
monopolization
under
section
2
of
the
act.
the
record
shows
that
this
inadvertent
restraint
on
alienation
was
canceled
by
ici
more
than
five
years
ago,
only
four
months
after
the
schwinn
decision
which
the
district
court
characterized
as
unpredictable,
this
is
not
my
characterization
and
four
months
before
the
complaint
in
this
case
was
filed.
moreover,
the
restraint
had
no
effect
on
competition
in
the
marketplace.
for
ici’s
reserved
power
was
never
exercised.
no
request
was
ever
made
to
ici
or
to
amho
for
bulk
griseofulvin
for
use
on
the
u.s.
commercial
market,
pages
14-15
of
our
brief
sets
forth
the
situation.
in
depositions
taken
by
the
government,
the
offices
of
one
large
and
one
small
drug
firm
testified
that
they
considered
the
u.s
griseofulvin
market
too
small,
too
competitive,
and
unattractive
for
entry.
that
market
by
the
way
had
shrunk
by
one-sixth
during
the
two-year
period,
1967-1969
from
about
8
million
dollars
retail
sales
annually
to
6.7
million
dollars.
by
their
own
affidavits,
none
of
the
independents
who
the
government
claims
were
denied
access
to
bulk
griseofulvin
showed
any
interest
in
the
drug
until
one
year
after
the
restriction
was
canceled.
considering
the
limited
operations
and
resources,
these
independents
in
fact
could
not
have
engaged
in
the
expensive
and
extended
clinical
and
toxicological
testing
as
necessary
to
obtain
food
and
drug
administration
approval
for
the
drug
which
we
describe
on
page
13
of
our
brief.
nor
could
they
have
sustained
a
heavy
laboratory
operating
and
promotional
expenses
involved
in
launching
the
product
on
a
national
market
with
appropriate
medical
safeguards.
the
record
therefore
i
submit
to
your
honors,
abundantly
supports
the
district
court’s
central
finding
on
relief
which
was
that
the
evidence
did
not
show
that
a
current
monopoly
condition
exists
as
a
result
of
the
bulk
resale
restriction.
absent
such
an
effect
or
result
and
such
a
condition
there
is
as
we
show
in
our
brief
no
legal
basis
for
a
compulsory
sale
and
compulsory
patent
licensing
relief
requested
by
the
government.
before
leaving
the
rest
of
the
subject
of
relief
to
our
brief
because
i
do
want
to
address
myself
to
the
second
issue
on
this
appeal,
i
should
like
to
point
out
one,
just
one
fact.
a
compulsory
sale
requirement
in
this
case
would
involve
ici
in
a
breach
of
its
binding
contractual
relationship
to
its
distributor
amho,
a
party
not
before
this
court.
this
is
unfair
we
think
to
amho
who
has
large
scale
expenditures
and
efforts
both
in
obtaining
the
food
and
drug
administration
approval
for
the
drug
and
launching
it
on
the
u.s
market
has
built
up
such
a
u.s
market
as
there
is
for
ici’s
$200,000-300,000
worth
of
annual
griseofulvin
exports
from
the
uk.
if
i
may,
i
should
like
to
address
myself
to
the
patents
and
validity
issue
and
on
this
connection,
i
wish
to
make
two
preliminary
points.
first,
the
ici
patent
is
not
a
worthless
and
specious
patent.
it
embodies
as
we
point
out
in
our
brief
on
pages
12
and
13
a
true
invention.
the
efficacy
of
the
drug
was
conceded
by
the
government
and
its
novelty
is
attested
to
by
the
medical
literature
to
which
we
refer
in
our
brief.
it
is
not
being
attacked
for
lack
of
patentability
and
also
lack
of
novelty
or
utility.
it
is
being
attacked
for
two
alleged
errors
of
judgment
by
the
patent
office
in
the
allowance
of
patent
claims,
mr.
friedman
has
described
to
you.
the
question
is,
is
the
possibility
of
correcting
such
errors
sufficient
justification
for
prolonging
into
an
indefinite
future
an
antitrust
litigation,
the
antitrust
aspects
of
which
have
been
concluded
after
five
painful
years.
second,
the
district
court
held
that
neither
ici
nor
the
glaxo
patent
had
been
abused.
yet
the
attorney
general
is
asking
for
broader
relief,
the
complete
invalidation
of
the
patent
then
a
private
defendant
and
a
patent
infringement
suit
could
obtained,
where
patent
misuse
had
been
abundantly
demonstrated.
on
pages
4-5
of
the
government's
reply
brief,
they
do
refer
to
the
morton
salt
and
empsall
(ph)
cases
which
still
establish
a
doctrine
of
patent
misuse.
but
i
must,
i
should
remind
the
court
that
this
court
has
held,
that
the
defendant
there
is
only
entitled
to
a
stay
of
the
infringement
suit
until
the
improper
practice
has
been
abandoned
whatever
that
might
be
in
our
case
and
the
consequences
of
a
misuse
of
the
patent
have
been
dissipated.
now
your
honors,
we
learned
for
the
first
time
from
the
government's
reply
brief
and
from
mr.
friedman’s
colloquy,
i
believe
it
was
with
mr.
justice
white
that
the
government’s
position
is
that
in
an
antitrust
controversy,
pendent
jurisdiction
of
a
patent
invalidity
claim
maybe
asserted.
this
is
my
apology
for
bringing
up
a
case
which
i
have
communicated
to
mr.
friedman.
it's
the
case
of
united
mine
workers
v.
gibbs,
383
u.s.
715.
this
case
teaches
us
that
for
pendent
jurisdiction
to
apply,
the
main
antitrust
claim
and
the
pendent
patent
invalidity
claim
must
derive
from
a
common
nucleus
of
operative
facts.
it
is
clear
that
the
factual
issues
relevant
to
the
alleged
errors
of
the
patent
office
and
its
allowance
to
the
ici
patent
claim
which
are
set
forth
on
pages
25
of
our
brief
and
to
which
i
refer
the
court
to
pages
437-450
of
the
appendix
have
nothing
in
common
with
the
factual
issues
involved
in
the
antitrust
action.
mr.
sailer
has
pointed
out
that
the
patent
invalidity
has
no
bearing
either
on
the
issue
of
the
antitrust
liability
or
on
the
issue
of
antitrust
relief.
on
pages
30-31
of
our
brief
we
indicate
that
compulsory
patent
licensing
relief
is
available
in
the
antitrust
cases
whenever
the
patent
poses
an
illegal
barrier
of
competition.
in
fact,
as
far
as
this
case
is
concerned
my
client
by
way
of
implementing
its
hands
off
policies
as
far
as
the
u.s.
market
is
concerned
has
made
its
patent
generally
available
for
licensing
and
has
granted
licenses
to
five
independents
on
reasonable
terms,
two
of
which
have
already
published
--
purchased
griseofulvin
from
amho,
its
distributor
and
amho,
i
should
also
point
out
as
the
record
shows
has
offered
to
make
bulk
griseofulvin
available
on
reasonable
terms
in
at
least
15
different
cases.
this
was
in
the
short
period
of
time
before
the
record
of
the
case
closed.
furthermore,
as
stated
in
gibbs,
pendent
jurisdiction
is
a
doctrine
of
judicial
discretion
justified
by
considerations
of
judicial
economy,
convenience
and
fairness
to
the
litigants.
the
challenge
of
patent
validity
supported
by
the
attorney
general
flies
in
the
face
we
think
of
these
considerations.
as
this
court
pointed
out
in
blonder-tongue,
it
would
needlessly
promote
protected
and
expensive
litigation.
it
expands
the
already
crowded
dockets
of
the
district
courts.
under
the
expediting
act,
this
court
would
have
to
review
such
extraneous
patent
validity
determinations
directly
from
the
district
court
without
the
helpful
assistance
of
the
circuit
courts
of
appeal.
also,
speaking
from
the
patentee
standpoint,
such
challenges
are
unfair
to
the
patentee.
he
is
entitled
to
assume
until
congress
has
spoken
to
the
contrary
that
the
action
of
the
patent
office
in
granting
the
patents
is
not
be
independently
challenged
by
one
or
two
lawyers
in
the
justice
department,
however
gifted
their
powers
of
analysis
maybe.
finally,
from
the
added
aspect
of
sherman
and
antitrust
enforcement,
these
challenges
and
this
would
be
academic
in
purpose,
those
exercises
that
would
operate
wastefully
to
divert
the
time,
money
and
resources
on
prosecutions.
a
word
about
the
legal
issues
in
the
case,
we
do
of
course
think
that
public
policy
considerations
do
favor
the
affirmance
of
the
district
court's
ruling,
but
they
determine
that
the
issue
was
illegal
one
that
goes
to
the
heart
of
our
constitution
system
of
separation
of
powers.
has
congress
in
fact,
authorized
the
courts
to
entertain
this
kind
of
challenge
of
patent
validity.
as
this
court
said
in
simpson
v.
union
oil,
congress
is
the
arbiter
of
the
public
interest.
thus,
even
with
a
more
effective
enforcement
of
sherman
act
was
at
stake,
this
court
has
been
unwilling
to
confer
on
private
parties,
a
remedy
that
had
not
been
prescribed
by
congress.
that
was
the
case
of
kelly
versus
kosuga,
it's
cited
on
our
brief.
similarly,
it
has
been
unwilling
to
confer
on
the
attorney
general
a
remedy
that
has
not
been
prescribed
by
congress
and
that
is
the
cooper
case
referred
to
in
our
brief.
as
this
court
said
in
the
cooper
case,
it
is
not
the
function
of
the
courts
to
engraft
on
the
statute
additions
which
they
think
the
legislature
logically
might
or
should
have
made.
the
rule
of
the
bell
case
has
been
stated
and
we
say
only
that
it
is
more
than
a
sound
rule
of
decision.
it
reflects
to
us
a
constitution
imperative.
for
the
courts
to
try
issues
of
patent
validity
without
congressional
authorization
involves
a
negation
we
think
of
two
basic
powers
conferred
by
the
constitution
on
the
congress.
one
of
these
is
the
plenary
power
of
congress
to
legislate
on
the
subject
of
patents.
the
other
is
the
exclusive
congressional
power
to
prescribe
the
jurisdiction
of
the
federal
courts,
including
the
jurisdiction
to
review
administrative
decisions
such
as
those
made
by
the
patent
office
in
this
case.
now,
in
the
exercise
of
this
patent
power,
congress
has
paid
particular
and
continuing
attention
to
the
administrative
procedures
for
examining
and
reviewing
patents
within
the
patent
office
and
its
predecessor
agencies
and
the
judicial
procedures
for
reviewing
these
administrative
determinations.
we
cite
on
page
36
of
our
brief,
12
such
cases
where
the
congress
has
amended
the
patent
code.
despite
this
meticulous
and
specific
supervision
by
the
congress
the
patent
code
contains
no
provision
conferring
this
authority
on
the
attorney
general
to
initiate
in
the
courts
the
kind
of
challenge
of
patent
validity
involved
in
this
case.
we
also
refer
in
footnote
42
of
our
brief
to
several
proposals
that
have
been
made
giving
the
attorney
general
and
other
persons
the
right
to
collaterally
challenge
patent
validity.
none
of
these
has
ever
been
reported
out
by
congressional
committee
and
it
is
significant
that
the
impact
of
these
proposals
is
that
the
challenger
must
sue
to
cancel
or
revoke
the
patent
in
the
patent
office
first
before
seeking
review
in
the
courts
and
it
is
submitted
that
perhaps
this
is
maybe
a
logical
method
of
procedure
rather
than
the
procedure
supported
by
the
government.
mr.
sigmund
timberg
it
is
indeed
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
it
has
been
in
the
statute
i
think
since
1870.
the
right
of
a
person
sued
for
patent
infringement
to
defend
case
is,
i
think
it's
in
the
statute.
yes
he
may
specifically
defend
on
the
purpose
--
on
the
grounds
of
invalidity.
i
don't
think
that's
going
to
be
contested.
in
fact,
i
don't
think
the
government
has
pointed
for
all
of
its
analogies
to
--
mr.
sigmund
timberg
it's
35,
my
colleague
informs
me,
it's
35
u.s.c.
282
confers
that
right.
mr.
sigmund
timberg
yes
and
that
was
along
the
same
line
of
reasoning,
that
like
to
the
gypsum
case.
in
other
words,
if
the
royalties
are
predicated
upon
an
illegal
agreement
and
it
is
a
private
and
the
illegality
--
mr.
sigmund
timberg
i
assume
under
lear
v.
adkins,
if
that
is
the
case
your
honor
is
referring
to,
it
would
be
able
to
challenge
patent.
mr.
sigmund
timberg
it's
predicated
on
something
else,
yes
your
honor.
i
would
like
to,
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
would
like
to
--
mr.
sigmund
timberg
yes.
mr.
sigmund
timberg
it's
based
ultimately
on
statute,
if
i
may
say
a
word
mr.
justice
blackmun
on
the
question
of
gypsum.
in
our
view
gypsum
confirms
the
bell
case
and
underscores
a
paramount
authority
of
the
congress
to
prescribe
the
jurisdiction
of
the
courts
and
the
authority
of
the
attorney
general.
in
enacting
the
sherman
act,
congress
did
confer
jurisdiction
on
the
federal
courts
to
entertain
antitrust
suits
that
were
brought
by
the
attorney
general.
there
was
a
possibility
in
gypsum
that
the
defendants
would
rely
on
patents
of
defense
to
a
charge
of
illegal
price
fixing.
hence
if
the
attorney
general
will
not
give
them
the
opportunity
to
show
patent
invalidity
and
that
the
asserted
shield
of
patentability
does
not
exist,
the
congressional
grant
of
jurisdiction
to
enforce
the
sherman
act
would
be
frustrated.
and
this
i
think
is
the
theme
that
i
would
suggest,
reconciles
gypsum
with
the
questions
that
both
of
your
honors
have
been
asking.
we
say
that
if
the
jurisdiction
of
the
sherman
act
would
be
frustrated
and
such
similar
situation
was
involved
in
the
walker
process
equipment
case,
yes,
in
those
cases
the
court
may
reach
to
a
patent
invalidity
defense,
but
what
the
government
is
doing
in
this
case
is
independently
of
raising
it
as
a
defense,
they
are
collaterally
in
their
complaint
attacking
patent
invalidity
in
a
situation
that
has
nothing
at
all
to
do
with
the
policy
of
the
antitrust
laws.
mr.
sigmund
timberg
it's
in
fact
that
were
alleged
to
be
the
leverage
that
made
the
restraint
possible
then
this
would
--
that
might
be
so,
but
this
is
not
that
case
your
honor.
this
is
a
situation
where
the
leverage
that
might
have
made
the
restraint
possible
was
the
fact
that
two
persons
control
the
manufacture
of
this
commodity
which
is
indeed
an
expensive
commodity.
mr.
sigmund
timberg
they
also
had
patents
may
i
say
and
they
also
cross-license
the
patents,
but
the
reason
that
they
cross-licensed
the
patents
through
each
other
was
that
they
were
blocking
patents.
they
couldn't
even
get
going
in
the
united
kingdom,
on
the
manufacture
of
the
griseofulvin
unless
they
cross-licensed
to
each
other.
mr.
sigmund
timberg
the
pool
couldn't
be
dissolved.
the
pool
that
was
really
a
settlement
of
conflicting
patent
rights
because
none
of
the
three
distributors
in
the
united
states
could
even
have
gotten
on
the
market
unless
they
had
access
to
ici’s
dosage
pack
which
as
mr.
sailer
has
pointed
out
was
the
only
patent
in
the
field
until
september
1967
when
the
glaxo
patent
came
in.
but
the
situation
in
england
was
much
more
complicated
than
that
and
i
would
want
your
honors
to
bear
in
mind
that
the
1960
agreement
which
the
government
has
referred
to
was
an
agreement
that
had
worldwide
implications.
it
was
i
think
agreement
between
two
british
companies.
it
wasn't
specifically
directed
against
the
u.s.
market
and
the
particular
provision
in
the
1960
agreement,
a
good
faith
provision
that
ici
imposed
this
restriction
on
its
distributor
was
something
that
was
found
illegal
only
to
the
extent
that
it
affected
the
u.s.
vendees
of
ici
which
was
just
our
exclusive
distributor
amho.
so
that
unless
this
court
is
going
to
say
that
it's
never
possible
for
people
who
have
blocking
patents
to,
like
cross-license
each
other
under
those
patents
and
that
they
must
automatically
license
the
world.
this
the
government’s
claim
for
a
licensing
in
this
case
is
not
i
think
one
that
is
warranted.
that
the
power
--
the
patent
was
not
used
to
--
was
not
used
to
stop
anybody
from
selling
griseofulvin
in
this
country.
the
only
antitrust
violation
was
the
restraint
on
alienation
which
was
canceled.
in
our
case,
the
patent
licensing
--
mr.
sigmund
timberg
if
the
patent,
if
the
--
well,
if
it
had
not
been
canceled
then
there
might
the
possibility
of
the
government
urging
that
the
dosage
patent
be
made
available
on
a
royalty
free
basis
--
excuse
me,
reasonable
royalty
basis
to
all
applicants
which
is
within
the
discretion
of
the
district
court.
mr.
sigmund
timberg
it
is
a
question
of
remedy,
pure
and
simple,
your
honor.
mr.
sigmund
timberg
it
is
a
remedy
question
but
i
get
back
to
the
reason
why
i
cited
kelly
and
kosuga
and
the
cooper
case,
it
is
if
you
want
to
call
it
a
remedy
you
may.
but
it
is
a
type
of
remedy
which
we
believe
should
be
authorized
by
the
congress
which
has
authorized
all
sorts
of
remedies
in
this
situation.
that
is
our
feeling
with
respect
to
this.
i
don't
think
--
the
only
other
ground
that
the
government
asserted
in
connection
with
jurisdiction
was
the
inherent
equity
jurisdiction
ground,
that
was
what
the
only
ground
we
thought
they
argued
in
the
district
court
and
in
our
brief
we
have
indicated
the
irrelevance
of
the
five
cases
cited
by
the
attorney
general
supporting
this
inherent
equity
jurisdiction.
none
of
them
involve
patents.
only
one
of
them
decided
in
1888
involved
the
judicial
review
of
an
administrative
determination
and
we
agree
with
the
result
in
that
case
because
we
do
believe
that
the
district
court
does
have
the
right
to
inherently
to
look
into
patents
obtained
by
fraud.
we
therefore
conclude
that
the
district
court
acted
wisely
and
correctly
and
urge
that
its
judgment
be
affirmed.
