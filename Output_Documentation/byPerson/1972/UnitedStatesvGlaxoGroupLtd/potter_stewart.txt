justice
potter
stewart
would
it
not
fall
on
mr.
friedman
that
the
government
could
bring
a
civil
antitrust
suit
against
any
patentee
claiming
that
since
his
patent
was
invalid
and
he
was
a
legal
monopolist
under
the
antitrust
laws?
justice
potter
stewart
well
they
were
not
an
issues
in
any
sense
that
of
the
word.
they
were
not
one
of
the
issues
to
be
determined
in
this
litigation,
the
way
the
issues
referring
by
the
aliment
pleading,
isn’t
it?
justice
potter
stewart
they
were
not
relied
upon
by
the
defendants?
justice
potter
stewart
therefore
they
were
not
one
of
the
issues
to
be
determined
in
the
antitrust
litigation?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
as
i
say,
then
it
would
follow,
it
would
seem
to
me
as
a
matter
of
logic
that
you
could
bring
an
antitrust
suit
against
any
patentee
claiming
that
his
patent
was
invalid
and
therefore
his
exercise
of
the
monopoly
violated
the
antitrust
laws.
justice
potter
stewart
well
patent
confers
upon
the
patentee
or
its
assignee
the
right
to
exercise
monopolistic
rights
with
respect
to
the
patent
for
the
number
of
years.
justice
potter
stewart
that
isn’t
a
very
historic
proposal.
justice
potter
stewart
did
in
gypsum
implicitly
decide
that
question
against
you?
justice
potter
stewart
in
gypsum,
the
court
does
said
that
where
the
patent
is
relied
on,
the
government
can
attack
the
patent’s
validity.
it
went
on
to
say
in
this
case,
there
was
an
antitrust
violation,
gypsum,
regardless
of
the
patent’s
validity
and
therefore
we
don’t
need
to
decide
the
patent’s
validity
in
this
case?
justice
potter
stewart
in
other
words,
saying
where
reliance
on
the
patent
does
not
give
immunity
from
the
antitrust
action,
we
don’t
need
to
decide
it?
justice
potter
stewart
the
validity
of
the
patent?
justice
potter
stewart
that’s
what
i
am
--
we
are
talking
about
here?
justice
potter
stewart
yeah.
justice
potter
stewart
i
got
the
idea
from
your
brief?
justice

stewart
would
it

that
the
