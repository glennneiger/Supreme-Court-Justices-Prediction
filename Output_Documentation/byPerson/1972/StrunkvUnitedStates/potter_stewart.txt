justice
potter
stewart
you’re
talking
about
the
passage
quoted
at
here
on
top
of
page
11
of
your
brief
i
assume.
justice
potter
stewart
which
in
smith
against
hooey
quoted
that
language,
i
think,
from
the
ewell
case
if
i’m
not
mistaken
undue
and
oppressive
incarceration
prior
to
trial?
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
reynolds,
this
--
what
you’re
saying
is
that
very
rational
justification
for
the
action
of
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case
but
of
course
as
justice,
my
brother
brennan
has
indicated
when
we
grant
certiorari
in
a
case
genteelly
under
the
--
if
our
rules
were
taken
seriously
its
because
the
issue
has
emanations
beyond
the
four
corners
of
the
particular
case.
and
what
i’m
concern
about
is
what
sort
of
guidance
does
these
give
to
district
courts
in
the
future,
to
district
courts
in
the
future.
when
a
motion
is
filed
to
dismiss
the
indictment
because
of
a
denial
of
a
speedy
trial
is
a
district
court
to
say
“yes,
you
have
been
denied
at
speedy
but
i’m
not
going
to
dismiss
the
indictment
you
have
to
go
and
be
tried”
that’s
what
you’re
telling
us.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
you
can’t
see
all
of
those
factors
until
after
a
trial
and
yet
barker
against
wingo
as
you
and
i
both
know
is
at
the
basic
remedy
for
denial
of
a
speedy
trial
is
not
going
to
be
any
trial.
justice
potter
stewart
i
just
read
the
motion
here
and
i
suppose
it
was
prepared
by
the
--
was
it
prepared
pro
se?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
you
say
--
justice
potter
stewart
what
i
thought,
maybe
i
think
it
was
pres
–
prepared
pros
se
was
he
said
he
didn’t
have
access
to
smith
against
hooey.
do
you
think
that
the
counsel
would
have
the
united
states
have
available
somewhere
the
united
states
reports?
justice
potter
stewart
by
counsel.
yes,
mr.
wideikis.
justice
potter
stewart
but
he
sets
out
all
sorts
of
reasons
in
support
of
his
claim
that
to
try
this
man
would
be
to
deny
his
right
to
a
speedy
trial
and
he
asked
that
the
indictment
therefore
be
dismissed.
now
on
your
rationalization,
the
district
court
faced
with
that
should
say
“yes”
and
even
if
he
agreed
that
to
try
him
would
be
to
deny
his
constitutional
right
to
a
speedy
trial
under
your
rationalization
that
district
court
should
nonetheless
say
“you’re
going
to
be
tried.”
now
how
can
that
be
--
district
courts
and
courts
of
appeals
in
the
country
have
to
be
guided
by
the
decision
of
this
court.
that’s
one
of
this
court’s
functions
and
what
may
be
papered
over
in
an
individual
case
is
to
what
the
court
of
appeals
may
have
done
in
an
individual
case.
there’s
something
quite
different
from
giving
guidance
to
district
courts
who
were
faced
with
motions
to
dismiss
indictments
by
reason
of
a
denial
of
a
speedy
trial.
what
do
you
propose
that
the
district
court
do?
justice
potter
stewart
the
denial
was
of
a
constitutional
right
and
then
you’re
--
you
have
a
right
not
to
be
tried
except
on
a
speedy
trial.
isn’t
that
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
and
how
can
a
district
judge
agreeing
with
the
defendant’s
claim
that
to
try
him
would
be
a
denial
of
a
speedy
trial,
how
can
he
deny
the
motion
and
that’s
what
your
telling
us
he
ought
to
do.
justice
potter
stewart
do
you
think
double
jeopardy
would
be
the
same
that
if
a
district
judge
agreed
that
to
try
her
again
would
to
be
to
put
you
twice
in
jeopardy,
you
should
nonetheless
let
you
be
tried
and
see
how
it
comes
out?
justice
potter
stewart
although
jeopardy
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
fair
trial
at
all.
justice
potter
stewart
i’m
still
puzzled
as
to
what
district
courts
are
going
to
do
if
your
--
justice
potter
stewart
well,
what
is
the
constitutional
right
--
i’m
sorry
i
apologize.
you
finish
your
answer
then
i’ll
ask
you.
justice
potter
stewart
no,
you
finish
i’ve
interrupted
you
and
i
apologize.
justice
potter
stewart
you
can’t
say
that
if
the
constitutional
right
is
a
right
not
be
trialed,
isn’t
that
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
except
by
--
except
in
a
speedy
trial
and
isn’t
that
the
constitutional
right
the
basic
right
and
if
it
is
what
choice
does
the
district
judge
have
if
he
is
convinced
that
too
much
time
and
pressures
has
taken
place
since
the
indictment
except
to
dismiss
if
the
right
is
a
right
not
to
be
tried?
