mr.
john
r.
wideikis
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
recently
began
a
serious
examination
of
the
right
to
a
speedy
trial.
it
began
with
the
united
states
versus
marion
where
this
court
determined
when
the
right
to
a
speedy
trial
attaches
and
continue
with
barker
versus
wingo
in
which
this
court
enunciated
the
balancing
formula
to
be
applied
in
making
ad
hoc
determinations
as
to
whether
or
not
that
right
has
been
violated.
this
court
today
is
called
upon
to
determine
the
sole
issue
of
remedy
to
be
applied
upon
a
finding
of
a
denial
of
a
speedy
trial
this
was
the
basic
issue
or
the
basic
question
framed
in
the
petition
writ
of
certiorari.
the
government
in
its
brief
however,
wishes
to
raise
as
an
additional
issue
the
question
whether
the
court
of
appeals
made
a
proper
ad
hoc
determination
in
finding
that
mr.
strunk
in
this
case
had
been
denied
his
right
to
a
speedy
trial.
and
because
i
don’t
know
whether
this
court
wishes
to
consider
re-examination
of
those
findings
of
the
court
of
appeals
i
will
give
a
broad
statement
of
the
facts.
this
case
began
on
june
30,
1969
when
clarence
strunk
stole
the
car
in
wisconsin
and
shortly
thereafter
drove
at
the
illinois
where
he
abandoned
it.
he
eventually
made
his
way
to
the
state
of
nebraska
where
on
july
24,
1969
he
was
arrested
on
a
state
charge
of
burglary.
on
a
plea
of
guilty
to
a
reduced
charge
of
larceny
he
received
a
one
to
three-year
sentence
in
the
nebraska
state
penitentiary.
while
in
nebraska
custody
on
september
3,
1969
at
his
own
request
he
was
seen
by
an
fbi
agent,
at
which
time
he
was
advised
of
his
rights
and
he
signed
a
waiver
form.
at
the
time
of
that
interview,
he
made
detailed
admissions
pertaining
to
the
facts
of
the
crime
that
he
had
committed
and
he
further
indicated
to
the
fbi
agent
that
it
was
his
intension
“to
demand
a
speedy
trial
under
rule
20.”
on
december
17,
1969
the
u.s
attorney
in
the
district
of
nebraska
wrote
to
the
u.s
attorney
in
the
eastern
district
of
illinois
and
in
his
letter
indicated
that
mr.
strunk
desired
to
enter
a
plea
under
rule
20
and
on
the
following
day
the
u.s.
attorney
of
illinois
sent
in
nebraska
the
necessary
forms
required
to
process
a
case
under
rule
20.
mr.
john
r.
wideikis
this
is
pre-indictment.
mr.
john
r.
wideikis
this
is
pre-indictment
mr.
chief
justice
wright
and
we
are
raising
no
issue
as
to
pre-indictment
delay
but
i
want
to
give
a
broad
statement
of
facts.
on
may
26,
1970
after
no
further
word
was
received
from
nebraska
the
u.s
attorney
in
illinois
presented
this
matter
to
the
grand
jury
and
an
indictment
was
returned
on
that
date.
on
august
13,
1970,
correspondence
was
receive
by
the
u.s
attorney
in
the
eastern
district
of
illinois
from
his
counterpart
in
nebraska
indicating
that
mr.
strunk
definitely
refused
to
enter
a
plea
under
rule
20
and
that
he
intended
to
raise
and
issue
a
speedy
trial.
as
the
court
of
appeals
put
it,
thereafter
nothing
happened
until
february
9,
1971
when
mr.
strunk
was
brought
to
east
st.
louis,
illinois
on
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus
ad
prosequendum.
and
there
in
the
district
court
for
the
eastern
district
of
illinois
he
was
arraigned
at
which
time
counsel
was
appointed
a
plea
of
not
guilty
was
entered
and
trial
was
set
for
march
29,
1971.
prior
to
the
trial,
mr.
strunk’s
counsel
move
for
a
dismissal
of
the
indictment
for
want
of
speedy
trial.
the
motion
was
denied.
he
went
to
trial
as
originally
scheduled
on
march
29,
1971.
he
was
tried
by
a
jury,
he
did
not
take
the
stand
and
he
offered
no
affirmative
defense
and
he
was
found
guilty.
he
received
a
sentence
of
five
years
imprisonment
which
sentence
was
to
run
concurrently
with
the
sentence
he
was
then
serving
in
nebraska.
an
appeal
was
taken
at
that
point
i
was
appointed
counsel
for
mr.
strunk.
our
case
was
argued
on
may
30,
1972.
on
june
22,
1972
the
decision
in
barker
versus
wingo
came
down.
it
was
recognized
by
the
court
of
appeals
and
it
was
a
controlling
case
applied
to
the
facts
in
the
instant
case.
mr.
john
r.
wideikis
yes,
your
honor.
there
was
some
delay
on
that
and
in
fact
that
subject
was
treated
within
the
findings
of
the
court
of
appeals.
what
the
court
of
appeals
said
they
concluded
first
i
will
start
with
the
conclusion
they
said
that
no
part
of
the
delay
after
the
indictment
was
attributable
to
mr.
strunk.
the
court
said
that
he
did
not
have
counsel
at
that
time
that
he
may
have
seem
to
have
desire
to
proceed
under
rule
20,
and
in
fact
when
he
was
quoted
as
having
said
that
he
wish
to
demand
a
speedy
trial
under
rule
20,
it
did
not
make
any
sense
to
the
court
of
appeals.
if
anything,
it
seemed
to
be
an
assertion
of
his
right
to
a
speedy
trial
a
desire
for
a
speedy
trial
which
of
course
he
didn’t
get.
now
the
court
of
appeals
found
that
the
length
of
the
delay
in
this
case
between
indictment
and
arraignment
was
259
days
and
they
felt
that
it
was
in
--
mr.
john
r.
wideikis
it
is
suggested
in
their
brief
your
honor
and
--
mr.
john
r.
wideikis
the
challenge
your
honor
i
find
in
their
brief.
mr.
john
r.
wideikis
they
did
not
cross-petition
your
honor.
mr.
john
r.
wideikis
however,
i
got
an
impression
on
page
12
your
honor
in
their
brief
at
footnote
10
where
i
will
quote
“if
this
court
should
conclude
on
a
balance
of
the
four
factors
in
barker
that
the
present
circumstances
and
explain
10
months
delay
resulting
in
virtually
no
prejudice
do
not
establish
a
speedy
trial
violation
etcetera”
that
struck
me
as
--
i
was
impressed
at
that
point
your
honor
that
they
were
urging
re-examination
of
those
issues
and
--
mr.
john
r.
wideikis
i
don’t
either,
your
honor.
mr.
john
r.
wideikis
the
argument
is
not
very
long
at
all,
your
honor.
no.
okay.
the
delay
was
unjustified
it
was
found.
it
found
that
mr.
strunk
had
satisfactory
asserted
his
right
to
a
speedy
trial
and
it
held
that
he
was
prejudiced.
now
a
crucial
aspect
in
this
case
is
the
type
of
prejudice
suffered.
the
prejudice
in
this
case
was
not
prejudice
with
respect
of
the
defense
of
his
case
but
rather
the
court
found
that
mr.
strunk
had
been
prejudiced
because
of
undue
and
oppressive
incarceration
prior
to
trial
relying
on
the
language
in
smith
versus
hooey,
and
that
mr.
strunk
suffered
a
substantial
loss
of
concurrent
time.
mr.
john
r.
wideikis
no
the
federal
incarceration,
your
honor.
no
that’s
--
no,
i’m
sorry
i
misunderstood
you.
right.
they
--
mr.
john
r.
wideikis
no,
he
was
in
the
penitentiary.
he
had
been
convicted
in
nebraska
your
honor.
mr.
john
r.
wideikis
he
was
in
nebraska’s
custody,
yes.
mr.
john
r.
wideikis
they
view
this
as
oppressive
incarceration
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
john
r.
wideikis
no,
it
rested
on
the
language
in
smith
versus
hooey,
in
that
--
mr.
john
r.
wideikis
no,
that
is
correct
your
honor.
mr.
john
r.
wideikis
they
did
your
honor,
in
the
sense
that,
although
he
was
lawfully
imprisoned
he
was
running
the
risk
of
losing
substantial
concurrent
time.
that
is
how
they
view
the
issue
of
prejudice
on
this
case
and
that
is
how
they
found
it.
mr.
john
r.
wideikis
yes,
it
would
be
your
honor.
right.
mr.
john
r.
wideikis
there
would
be
no
way
to
know
and
i
submit
that
the
language
in
smith
versus
hooey
where
it
points
out
that
the
possibility
of
loss
of
concurrent
time
is
what
the
court
really
meant
in
that
respect.
it’s
the
possibility
of
this
loss
and
of
course
the
possibility
did
in
fact
become
true
in
our
case.
the
court
in
our
case
acknowledged
that
dismissal
of
the
indictment
was
the
traditional
remedy.
however
they
felt
that,
that
was
a
drastic
relief
in
this
case.
accordingly,
they
remanded
the
case
with
direction
that
mr.
strunk
be
given
259
days
credit
on
his
sentence.
i
would
like
to
point
out
one
thing
parenthetically.
the
government
in
its
brief
asserts
that
the
petitioner
somehow
believes
that
the
remedy
applied
below
was
appropriate.
well,
of
course
if
that’s
true
i
don’t
know
why
i
am
here
today
but
in
any
event
the
briefs
in
the
case
below
were
written
prior
to
the
barker
versus
wingo
decision.
and
we
know
that
the
barker
dicta
contain
some
very
interesting
language
on
the
subject
of
remedy.
furthermore,
in
my
briefs
below
i
listed
a
series
of
alternative
relief.
i
did
that
in
the
event
that
if
no
finding
of
the
denial
of
speedy
trial
were
arrived
at
that
if
the
court
found
some
other
error
that
was
amenable
to
correction
i
wanted
a
tender
relief
that
they
might
resort
to.
now
technically,
the
issue
below
before
the
seventh
circuit
court
of
appeals
was
whether
or
not
the
district
court
adhered
in
denying
mr.
strunk’s
motion
to
dismiss
his
indictment
for
want
of
a
speedy
trial
and
we
submit
that
the
perspective
of
the
court
of
appeals
was
fixed
by
that
issue.
and
that
it
was
obliged
to
view
the
facts
in
analysis
in
that
case
from
the
same
perspective
as
to
court
of
appeals.
now
the
issue
would
necessarily
require
the
court
to
make
a
determination
as
to
whether
or
not
there
was
a
violation
of
the
right,
and
since
the
court
of
appeals
found
the
denial.
it
is
reasonable
that
district
court
should
have
found
the
denial
of
the
right
to
a
speedy
trial
and
had
the
district
court
done
so,
we
submit
that
the
one
thing
that
it
could
not
do
at
that
point
was
to
order
mr.
strunk
to
trial
not
withstanding.
yet
this
was
the
effect
of
the
remedy
that
was
applied
by
the
court
of
appeals.
the
government
in
its
brief
suggest
that
the
district
court
while
finding
a
denial
of
a
speedy
trial
could
order
mr.
strunk
to
trial
despite
that
fact
adding
that
in
the
event
he
were
convicted
they
would
couple
a
ruling
which
would
say
that
he
could
be
given
credit
on
his
sentence
for
whatever
unjustified
delay
occurred
in
that
case.
the
difficulty
with
that
argument
is
that
it,
it
ignores
that
at
time
of
the
finding
mr.
strunk
was
presumed
innocent
and
if
on
trial
he
refuted
the
result
would
have
been
an
admitted
denial
of
the
right
with
no
remedy.
and
this
is
serious
we
submit
because
it
judicially
repeals
the
word
“speedy”
from
the
sixth
amendment
and
merely
leaves
an
accused
with
the
right
to
be
tried.
now,
we
are
also
arguing
in
this
case
here
that
the
remedy
applied
below
if
permitted
to
stand
will
encourage
government
prosecutors
to
give
low
priority
to
cases
of
the
sort
involved
here.
that
is
where
you
have
an
accused
who
is
a
prisoner
in
another
jurisdiction
on
a
related
charge.
now
if
a
prosecutor
can
reasonably
anticipate
that
the
only
prejudice
to
be
suffered
by
an
accused
is
this
smith
versus
hooey
type
of
undue
and
oppressive
incarceration
prior
to
trial
he
is
really
under
no
duty
to
exercise
diligence
in
bringing
the
accused
to
trial.
for
the
district
court
presumably
can
compensate
for
a
violation
of
the
right
in
the
event
of
conviction.
now
since
an
accused
such
as
strunk
can
be
seemingly
made
hold
the
prosecutors
will
decide
a
low
priority
to
such
cases.
now
the
government
in
its
brief
asserts
that
there’s
no
substance
to
this
position
and
i
have
difficulty
understanding
how
they
can
make
that
assertion.
i
would
like
to
call
the
court’s
attention
specifically
to
page
10
in
the
government’s
brief
where
the
government
in
endeavoring
to
explain
the
delay
in
bringing
mr.
strunk
to
trial
admits
that
in
this
case
prosecutorial
resources
were
devoted
to
other
active
cases
commanding
a
higher
priority
than
mr.
strunk’s.
the
final
point
i’d
like
to
make
your
honors,
is
that
we
are
urging
the
remedy
for
a
violation
of
the
right
to
a
speedy
trial
to
be
absolute
discharge.
mr.
john
r.
wideikis
your
honor,
i
find
--
i’m
sorry
a
system
of
priorities
in
this
area
to
be
totally
repugnant
and
i
submit
this
because
it
work
such
a
gross
unfairness
to
a
defendant
to
have
his
case
relegated
to
a
low
priority.
mr.
john
r.
wideikis
i
am
not
saying
that
--
what
i
think
i’m
trying
to
say,
your
honor
is
that
and
i’m
not
avoiding
your
question,
is
that
we
have
a
problem
today
that
all
of
us
recognize
in
terms
of
the
effective
administration
of
criminal
justice.
we
have
tremendous
back
logs,
we
have
overworked
prosecutors,
we
have
overworked
overburdened
judges
there’s
no
doubt
about
it.
so
while
the
system
is
far
from
perfect
it
is
not
any
defendant’s
fault
that
it
is.
if
we
have
to
assign
responsibility
for
poor
administration
of
justice
if
we
care
to
it
that,
that
it
is
societies
fault
not
a
defendants.
and
for
that
reason
i
can
not
acknowledge
any
validity
to
any
system
of
priorities
within
cases.
i
can’t
see
how
a
decision
can
be
made
arbitrarily
that
one
case
is
more
important
than
another.
mr.
john
r.
wideikis
oppressive.
mr.
john
r.
wideikis
i
think
the
language
i
have
used
mr.
justice
blackmun
comes
from
the
decision
in
smith
versus
hooey.
the
court
used
that
language
at
the
course
was
in
u.s
versus
ewell
also.
i
think
what
the
language
suggests
is
that
the
distinction
is
this
“undue
incarceration”
i
would
submit
arises
out
of
a
negligence
context.
let’s
say
a
carelessness
context
in
bringing
someone
to
trial,
mere
accident
in
delaying.
whereas
oppressive
would
be
the
most
heinous
form
of
incarceration
part
of
the
trial
because
there
i
think
it
is
purposeful.
now
i’m
not
making
any
claim
in
this
case
here
that
there
was
oppressive
incarceration.
i
have
coupled
the
term
undue
and
oppressive
because
of
the
language
in
smith
versus
hooey.
mr.
john
r.
wideikis
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
john
r.
wideikis
that
came
from
ewell,
yes
your
honor.
right
and
in
the
decision
they
elaborated
on
it
within
a
prisoner
accused
context.
mr.
john
r.
wideikis
now
while
the
remedy
of
absolute
discharge
is
severe
it
is
no
more
severe
than
what
a
finding
of
a
denial
of
a
speedy
trial
right
asserts.
a
finding
of
a
denial
of
the
right
of
the
speedy
trial
is
one
of
the
few
areas
in
the
law
that
is
not
gray.
it
contains
within
itself
a
distinction
is
clearly
precise
as
midnight
is
from
noon.
it
says
essentially
government
you
had
the
full
and
unfettered
opportunity
to
try
this
accused
you
failed
to
do
so
and
the
fault
is
entirely
yours.
now,
if
we
wish
to
give
meaning
to
the
constitutional
mandate
that
trials
be
speedy,
then
we
submit
we
should
enforce
it
vigorously
with
absolute
discharge.
mr.
john
r.
wideikis
nothing
more
than
that
your
honor
that
was
it.
mr.
john

exactly
what
the
government
take
it
the
court
can
give
it
back.
it
was
a
compensatory
remedy
but
it
has
no
constitutional
foundation
for
points
that
i’ve
raised
earlier.
it’s
the
kind
of
a
remedy
that
a
district
court
could
not
have
done
to
give
a
compensatory
remedy
recognizes
the
validity
of
a
trial
while
with
this
finding
we
submit,
there
could
not
have
been
a
trial.
this
man
was
procedurally
innocent
he
couldn’t
get
to
substantive
stage
of
proceedings.
now
the
government
suggests
that
absolute
discharge
serves
the
penalize
society.
well,
if
it
does
then
society
must
chastise
not
this
defendant
mr.
strunk,
but
its
agent
the
government
for
squandering
its
right
to
try
him.
the
government
suggests
that
we’re
urging
amnesty
in
this
case.
i
don’t
understand
how
they
can
use
the
word
amnesty
since
amnesty
usually
pertains,
it
usually
given
to
one
who
is
at
fault
who’s
committed
some
wrong
but
the
finding
of
the
denial
of
a
speedy
trial
says
that
strunk
was
procedurally
innocent.
finally,
the
court
suggest
that
the
remedy
urged
by
the
petitioner
visits
retribution
on
the
government
and
the
public.
if
it
does,
we
submit
that
the
retribution
is
self-inflicted
and
the
injured
should
not
be
heard
to
complain.
thank
you.
mr.
john
r.
wideikis
oh!
no,
sir.
no,
your
honor.
mr.
john
r.
wideikis
oh!
i
don’t
see
that
at
all
your
honor.
we
have
barker
versus
wingo
applied
by
the
court
of
appeals
to
the
facts
in
the
case.
they
made
a
determination
that
there
was
a
denial
of
speedy
trial
here.
barker
versus
wingo
did
not
speak
directly
to
the
issue
of
remedy
for
a
denial
of
a
speedy
trial
but
it
contains
dicta
which
suggested
that
dismissal
to
the
indictment
was
the
only
possible
remedy.
but
i
have
no
appreciation
of
the
suggestion
your
honor
that
it
conflicts
in
anyway
with
barker
versus
wingo.
mr.
john
r.
wideikis
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
recently
began
a
serious
examination
of
the
right
to
a
speedy
trial.
it
began
with
the
united
states
versus
marion
where
this
court
determined
when
the
right
to
a
speedy
trial
attaches
and
continue
with
barker
versus
wingo
in
which
this
court
enunciated
the
balancing
formula
to
be
applied
in
making
ad
hoc
determinations
as
to
whether
or
not
that
right
has
been
violated.
this
court
today
is
called
upon
to
determine
the
sole
issue
of
remedy
to
be
applied
upon
a
finding
of
a
denial
of
a
speedy
trial
this
was
the
basic
issue
or
the
basic
question
framed
in
the
petition
writ
of
certiorari.
the
government
in
its
brief
however,
wishes
to
raise
as
an
additional
issue
the
question
whether
the
court
of
appeals
made
a
proper
ad
hoc
determination
in
finding
that
mr.
strunk
in
this
case
had
been
denied
his
right
to
a
speedy
trial.
and
because
i
don’t
know
whether
this
court
wishes
to
consider
re-examination
of
those
findings
of
the
court
of
appeals
i
will
give
a
broad
statement
of
the
facts.
this
case
began
on
june
30,
1969
when
clarence
strunk
stole
the
car
in
wisconsin
and
shortly
thereafter
drove
at
the
illinois
where
he
abandoned
it.
he
eventually
made
his
way
to
the
state
of
nebraska
where
on
july
24,
1969
he
was
arrested
on
a
state
charge
of
burglary.
on
a
plea
of
guilty
to
a
reduced
charge
of
larceny
he
received
a
one
to
three-year
sentence
in
the
nebraska
state
penitentiary.
while
in
nebraska
custody
on
september
3,
1969
at
his
own
request
he
was
seen
by
an
fbi
agent,
at
which
time
he
was
advised
of
his
rights
and
he
signed
a
waiver
form.
at
the
time
of
that
interview,
he
made
detailed
admissions
pertaining
to
the
facts
of
the
crime
that
he
had
committed
and
he
further
indicated
to
the
fbi
agent
that
it
was
his
intension
“to
demand
a
speedy
trial
under
rule
20.”
on
december
17,
1969
the
u.s
attorney
in
the
district
of
nebraska
wrote
to
the
u.s
attorney
in
the
eastern
district
of
illinois
and
in
his
letter
indicated
that
mr.
strunk
desired
to
enter
a
plea
under
rule
20
and
on
the
following
day
the
u.s.
attorney
of
illinois
sent
in
nebraska
the
necessary
forms
required
to
process
a
case
under
rule
20.
mr.
john
r.
wideikis
this
is
pre-indictment.
mr.
john
r.
wideikis
this
is
pre-indictment
mr.
chief
justice
wright
and
we
are
raising
no
issue
as
to
pre-indictment
delay
but
i
want
to
give
a
broad
statement
of
facts.
on
may
26,
1970
after
no
further
word
was
received
from
nebraska
the
u.s
attorney
in
illinois
presented
this
matter
to
the
grand
jury
and
an
indictment
was
returned
on
that
date.
on
august
13,
1970,
correspondence
was
receive
by
the
u.s
attorney
in
the
eastern
district
of
illinois
from
his
counterpart
in
nebraska
indicating
that
mr.
strunk
definitely
refused
to
enter
a
plea
under
rule
20
and
that
he
intended
to
raise
and
issue
a
speedy
trial.
as
the
court
of
appeals
put
it,
thereafter
nothing
happened
until
february
9,
1971
when
mr.
strunk
was
brought
to
east
st.
louis,
illinois
on
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus
ad
prosequendum.
and
there
in
the
district
court
for
the
eastern
district
of
illinois
he
was
arraigned
at
which
time
counsel
was
appointed
a
plea
of
not
guilty
was
entered
and
trial
was
set
for
march
29,
1971.
prior
to
the
trial,
mr.
strunk’s
counsel
move
for
a
dismissal
of
the
indictment
for
want
of
speedy
trial.
the
motion
was
denied.
he
went
to
trial
as
originally
scheduled
on
march
29,
1971.
he
was
tried
by
a
jury,
he
did
not
take
the
stand
and
he
offered
no
affirmative
defense
and
he
was
found
guilty.
he
received
a
sentence
of
five
years
imprisonment
which
sentence
was
to
run
concurrently
with
the
sentence
he
was
then
serving
in
nebraska.
an
appeal
was
taken
at
that
point
i
was
appointed
counsel
for
mr.
strunk.
our
case
was
argued
on
may
30,
1972.
on
june
22,
1972
the
decision
in
barker
versus
wingo
came
down.
it
was
recognized
by
the
court
of
appeals
and
it
was
a
controlling
case
applied
to
the
facts
in
the
instant
case.
mr.
john
r.
wideikis
yes,
your
honor.
there
was
some
delay
on
that
and
in
fact
that
subject
was
treated
within
the
findings
of
the
court
of
appeals.
what
the
court
of
appeals
said
they
concluded
first
i
will
start
with
the
conclusion
they
said
that
no
part
of
the
delay
after
the
indictment
was
attributable
to
mr.
strunk.
the
court
said
that
he
did
not
have
counsel
at
that
time
that
he
may
have
seem
to
have
desire
to
proceed
under
rule
20,
and
in
fact
when
he
was
quoted
as
having
said
that
he
wish
to
demand
a
speedy
trial
under
rule
20,
it
did
not
make
any
sense
to
the
court
of
appeals.
if
anything,
it
seemed
to
be
an
assertion
of
his
right
to
a
speedy
trial
a
desire
for
a
speedy
trial
which
of
course
he
didn’t
get.
now
the
court
of
appeals
found
that
the
length
of
the
delay
in
this
case
between
indictment
and
arraignment
was
259
days
and
they
felt
that
it
was
in
--
mr.
john
r.
wideikis
it
is
suggested
in
their
brief
your
honor
and
--
mr.
john
r.
wideikis
the
challenge
your
honor
i
find
in
their
brief.
mr.
john
r.
wideikis
they
did
not
cross-petition
your
honor.
mr.
john
r.
wideikis
however,
i
got
an
impression
on
page
12
your
honor
in
their
brief
at
footnote
10
where
i
will
quote
“if
this
court
should
conclude
on
a
balance
of
the
four
factors
in
barker
that
the
present
circumstances
and
explain
10
months
delay
resulting
in
virtually
no
prejudice
do
not
establish
a
speedy
trial
violation
etcetera”
that
struck
me
as
--
i
was
impressed
at
that
point
your
honor
that
they
were
urging
re-examination
of
those
issues
and
--
mr.
john
r.
wideikis
i
don’t
either,
your
honor.
mr.
john
r.
wideikis
the
argument
is
not
very
long
at
all,
your
honor.
no.
okay.
the
delay
was
unjustified
it
was
found.
it
found
that
mr.
strunk
had
satisfactory
asserted
his
right
to
a
speedy
trial
and
it
held
that
he
was
prejudiced.
now
a
crucial
aspect
in
this
case
is
the
type
of
prejudice
suffered.
the
prejudice
in
this
case
was
not
prejudice
with
respect
of
the
defense
of
his
case
but
rather
the
court
found
that
mr.
strunk
had
been
prejudiced
because
of
undue
and
oppressive
incarceration
prior
to
trial
relying
on
the
language
in
smith
versus
hooey,
and
that
mr.
strunk
suffered
a
substantial
loss
of
concurrent
time.
mr.
john
r.
wideikis
no
the
federal
incarceration,
your
honor.
no
that’s
--
no,
i’m
sorry
i
misunderstood
you.
right.
they
--
mr.
john
r.
wideikis
no,
he
was
in
the
penitentiary.
he
had
been
convicted
in
nebraska
your
honor.
mr.
john
r.
wideikis
he
was
in
nebraska’s
custody,
yes.
mr.
john
r.
wideikis
they
view
this
as
oppressive
incarceration
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
john
r.
wideikis
no,
it
rested
on
the
language
in
smith
versus
hooey,
in
that
--
mr.
john
r.
wideikis
no,
that
is
correct
your
honor.
mr.
john
r.
wideikis
they
did
your
honor,
in
the
sense
that,
although
he
was
lawfully
imprisoned
he
was
running
the
risk
of
losing
substantial
concurrent
time.
that
is
how
they
view
the
issue
of
prejudice
on
this
case
and
that
is
how
they
found
it.
mr.
john
r.
wideikis
yes,
it
would
be
your
honor.
right.
mr.
john
r.
wideikis
there
would
be
no
way
to
know
and
i
submit
that
the
language
in
smith
versus
hooey
where
it
points
out
that
the
possibility
of
loss
of
concurrent
time
is
what
the
court
really
meant
in
that
respect.
it’s
the
possibility
of
this
loss
and
of
course
the
possibility
did
in
fact
become
true
in
our
case.
the
court
in
our
case
acknowledged
that
dismissal
of
the
indictment
was
the
traditional
remedy.
however
they
felt
that,
that
was
a
drastic
relief
in
this
case.
accordingly,
they
remanded
the
case
with
direction
that
mr.
strunk
be
given
259
days
credit
on
his
sentence.
i
would
like
to
point
out
one
thing
parenthetically.
the
government
in
its
brief
asserts
that
the
petitioner
somehow
believes
that
the
remedy
applied
below
was
appropriate.
well,
of
course
if
that’s
true
i
don’t
know
why
i
am
here
today
but
in
any
event
the
briefs
in
the
case
below
were
written
prior
to
the
barker
versus
wingo
decision.
and
we
know
that
the
barker
dicta
contain
some
very
interesting
language
on
the
subject
of
remedy.
furthermore,
in
my
briefs
below
i
listed
a
series
of
alternative
relief.
i
did
that
in
the
event
that
if
no
finding
of
the
denial
of
speedy
trial
were
arrived
at
that
if
the
court
found
some
other
error
that
was
amenable
to
correction
i
wanted
a
tender
relief
that
they
might
resort
to.
now
technically,
the
issue
below
before
the
seventh
circuit
court
of
appeals
was
whether
or
not
the
district
court
adhered
in
denying
mr.
strunk’s
motion
to
dismiss
his
indictment
for
want
of
a
speedy
trial
and
we
submit
that
the
perspective
of
the
court
of
appeals
was
fixed
by
that
issue.
and
that
it
was
obliged
to
view
the
facts
in
analysis
in
that
case
from
the
same
perspective
as
to
court
of
appeals.
now
the
issue
would
necessarily
require
the
court
to
make
a
determination
as
to
whether
or
not
there
was
a
violation
of
the
right,
and
since
the
court
of
appeals
found
the
denial.
it
is
reasonable
that
district
court
should
have
found
the
denial
of
the
right
to
a
speedy
trial
and
had
the
district
court
done
so,
we
submit
that
the
one
thing
that
it
could
not
do
at
that
point
was
to
order
mr.
strunk
to
trial
not
withstanding.
yet
this
was
the
effect
of
the
remedy
that
was
applied
by
the
court
of
appeals.
the
government
in
its
brief
suggest
that
the
district
court
while
finding
a
denial
of
a
speedy
trial
could
order
mr.
strunk
to
trial
despite
that
fact
adding
that
in
the
event
he
were
convicted
they
would
couple
a
ruling
which
would
say
that
he
could
be
given
credit
on
his
sentence
for
whatever
unjustified
delay
occurred
in
that
case.
the
difficulty
with
that
argument
is
that
it,
it
ignores
that
at
time
of
the
finding
mr.
strunk
was
presumed
innocent
and
if
on
trial
he
refuted
the
result
would
have
been
an
admitted
denial
of
the
right
with
no
remedy.
and
this
is
serious
we
submit
because
it
judicially
repeals
the
word
“speedy”
from
the
sixth
amendment
and
merely
leaves
an
accused
with
the
right
to
be
tried.
now,
we
are
also
arguing
in
this
case
here
that
the
remedy
applied
below
if
permitted
to
stand
will
encourage
government
prosecutors
to
give
low
priority
to
cases
of
the
sort
involved
here.
that
is
where
you
have
an
accused
who
is
a
prisoner
in
another
jurisdiction
on
a
related
charge.
now
if
a
prosecutor
can
reasonably
anticipate
that
the
only
prejudice
to
be
suffered
by
an
accused
is
this
smith
versus
hooey
type
of
undue
and
oppressive
incarceration
prior
to
trial
he
is
really
under
no
duty
to
exercise
diligence
in
bringing
the
accused
to
trial.
for
the
district
court
presumably
can
compensate
for
a
violation
of
the
right
in
the
event
of
conviction.
now
since
an
accused
such
as
strunk
can
be
seemingly
made
hold
the
prosecutors
will
decide
a
low
priority
to
such
cases.
now
the
government
in
its
brief
asserts
that
there’s
no
substance
to
this
position
and
i
have
difficulty
understanding
how
they
can
make
that
assertion.
i
would
like
to
call
the
court’s
attention
specifically
to
page
10
in
the
government’s
brief
where
the
government
in
endeavoring
to
explain
the
delay
in
bringing
mr.
strunk
to
trial
admits
that
in
this
case
prosecutorial
resources
were
devoted
to
other
active
cases
commanding
a
higher
priority
than
mr.
strunk’s.
the
final
point
i’d
like
to
make
your
honors,
is
that
we
are
urging
the
remedy
for
a
violation
of
the
right
to
a
speedy
trial
to
be
absolute
discharge.
mr.
john
r.
wideikis
your
honor,
i
find
--
i’m
sorry
a
system
of
priorities
in
this
area
to
be
totally
repugnant
and
i
submit
this
because
it
work
such
a
gross
unfairness
to
a
defendant
to
have
his
case
relegated
to
a
low
priority.
mr.
john
r.
wideikis
i
am
not
saying
that
--
what
i
think
i’m
trying
to
say,
your
honor
is
that
and
i’m
not
avoiding
your
question,
is
that
we
have
a
problem
today
that
all
of
us
recognize
in
terms
of
the
effective
administration
of
criminal
justice.
we
have
tremendous
back
logs,
we
have
overworked
prosecutors,
we
have
overworked
overburdened
judges
there’s
no
doubt
about
it.
so
while
the
system
is
far
from
perfect
it
is
not
any
defendant’s
fault
that
it
is.
if
we
have
to
assign
responsibility
for
poor
administration
of
justice
if
we
care
to
it
that,
that
it
is
societies
fault
not
a
defendants.
and
for
that
reason
i
can
not
acknowledge
any
validity
to
any
system
of
priorities
within
cases.
i
can’t
see
how
a
decision
can
be
made
arbitrarily
that
one
case
is
more
important
than
another.
mr.
john
r.
wideikis
oppressive.
mr.
john
r.
wideikis
i
think
the
language
i
have
used
mr.
justice
blackmun
comes
from
the
decision
in
smith
versus
hooey.
the
court
used
that
language
at
the
course
was
in
u.s
versus
ewell
also.
i
think
what
the
language
suggests
is
that
the
distinction
is
this
“undue
incarceration”
i
would
submit
arises
out
of
a
negligence
context.
let’s
say
a
carelessness
context
in
bringing
someone
to
trial,
mere
accident
in
delaying.
whereas
oppressive
would
be
the
most
heinous
form
of
incarceration
part
of
the
trial
because
there
i
think
it
is
purposeful.
now
i’m
not
making
any
claim
in
this
case
here
that
there
was
oppressive
incarceration.
i
have
coupled
the
term
undue
and
oppressive
because
of
the
language
in
smith
versus
hooey.
mr.
john
r.
wideikis
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
john
r.
wideikis
that
came
from
ewell,
yes
your
honor.
right
and
in
the
decision
they
elaborated
on
it
within
a
prisoner
accused
context.
mr.
john
r.
wideikis
now
while
the
remedy
of
absolute
discharge
is
severe
it
is
no
more
severe
than
what
a
finding
of
a
denial
of
a
speedy
trial
right
asserts.
a
finding
of
a
denial
of
the
right
of
the
speedy
trial
is
one
of
the
few
areas
in
the
law
that
is
not
gray.
it
contains
within
itself
a
distinction
is
clearly
precise
as
midnight
is
from
noon.
it
says
essentially
government
you
had
the
full
and
unfettered
opportunity
to
try
this
accused
you
failed
to
do
so
and
the
fault
is
entirely
yours.
now,
if
we
wish
to
give
meaning
to
the
constitutional
mandate
that
trials
be
speedy,
then
we
submit
we
should
enforce
it
vigorously
with
absolute
discharge.
mr.
john
r.
wideikis
nothing
more
than
that
your
honor
that
was
it.
mr.
john
r.
wideikis
exactly
what
the
government
take
it
the
court
can
give
it
back.
it
was
a
compensatory
remedy
but
it
has
no
constitutional
foundation
for
points
that
i’ve
raised
earlier.
it’s
the
kind
of
a
remedy
that
a
district
court
could
not
have
done
to
give
a
compensatory
remedy
recognizes
the
validity
of
a
trial
while
with
this
finding
we
submit,
there
could
not
have
been
a
trial.
this
man
was
procedurally
innocent
he
couldn’t
get
to
substantive
stage
of
proceedings.
now
the
government
suggests
that
absolute
discharge
serves
the
penalize
society.
well,
if
it
does
then
society
must
chastise
not
this
defendant
mr.
strunk,
but
its
agent
the
government
for
squandering
its
right
to
try
him.
the
government
suggests
that
we’re
urging
amnesty
in
this
case.
i
don’t
understand
how
they
can
use
the
word
amnesty
since
amnesty
usually
pertains,
it
usually
given
to
one
who
is
at
fault
who’s
committed
some
wrong
but
the
finding
of
the
denial
of
a
speedy
trial
says
that
strunk
was
procedurally
innocent.
finally,
the
court
suggest
that
the
remedy
urged
by
the
petitioner
visits
retribution
on
the
government
and
the
public.
if
it
does,
we
submit
that
the
retribution
is
self-inflicted
and
the
injured
should
not
be
heard
to
complain.
thank
you.
mr.
john
r.
wideikis
oh!
no,
sir.
no,
your
honor.
mr.
john
r.
wideikis
oh!
i
don’t
see
that
at
all
your
honor.
we
have
barker
versus
wingo
applied
by
the
court
of
appeals
to
the
facts
in
the
case.
they
made
a
determination
that
there
was
a
denial
of
speedy
trial
here.
barker
versus
wingo
did
not
speak
directly
to
the
issue
of
remedy
for
a
denial
of
a
speedy
trial
but
it
contains
dicta
which
suggested
that
dismissal
to
the
indictment
was
the
only
possible
remedy.
but
i
have
no
appreciation
of
the
suggestion
your
honor
that
it
conflicts
in
anyway
with
barker
versus
wingo.
