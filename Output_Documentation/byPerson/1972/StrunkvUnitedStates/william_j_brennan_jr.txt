justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
may
i
just
add.
do
you
read
the
government
as
asking
us
to
review
the
conclusion
that
a
speedy
was
denied?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
thought
all
they
were
saying
was
the
assuming
arguendo.
i
don’t
understand
the
challenge
of
finding
that.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
they
have
--
they
didn’t
cross-petition.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
don’t
read
their
question
presented
as
suggesting
that
they
challenge
our
holding.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
just
don’t
see
how
they
can.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no
cross-petition.
well,
i
just
wonder
why
you’re
wasting
so
much
time
on
it.
we’ve
got
a
difficult
enough
problem
on
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
excuse
me
mr.
reynolds.
i
gather
you
are
defending
this
by
asking
us
to
review
the
holding
that
there
was
a
denial,
right?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
do
you
think
we
took
the
case
for
that
purpose.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
if
we
want
it
--
you
mean,
if
we
want
to
avoid
deciding
the
issue
for
which
we
took
it.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
you
responsibly
never
suggested
that
to
the
petition
for
certiorari.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
you
never
filed
any
cross-petition.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
while
you
are
doing
you’re
just
saying
we
don’t
have
to
decide
the
question
because
they
were
wrong
anyway
on
the
holding.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
you’re
urging
us
to
do
it,
aren’t
you?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
why
would
we
have
taken
the
case
if
that
was
the
disposition
we
made
of
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
we
have
enough
things
to
do,
i
should
suggest.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
mr.
reynolds,
tell
me
what
happens
if
a
motion
is
made
to
dismiss
the
indictment
in
the
grounds
of
denial
of
speedy
trial?
the
court
concludes
“yes”
it’s
been
denied
but
will
go
to
trial
anyway
and
if
you’re
convicted
what?
then
they’re
suppose
--
the
judge
is
suppose
to
take
it
into
account
in
fixing
sentence,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
just
take
what’s
likely
to
be
ordinary
situation.
the
claim
has
been
this
is
before
there’s
been
a
trial
that
he’s
been
denied
a
speedy
trial.
the
trial
judge
agrees,
you
have
been
denied
a
speedy
trial
but
nevertheless
go
to
trial.
now
what
is
it
--
in
those
circumstances
where
he
tells
him
go
ahead
and
go
to
trial
and
he
is
convicted
then
what’s
the
trial
judge
do?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
what
happen
in
my
--
how
in
my
situation
i
put
this.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
can
the
district
judge
do?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
don’t
know,
i
don’t
know,
but
my
hypothesis
is
if
he
finds
there’s
been
a
denial
of
speedy
trial.
now
what’s
he
supposed
to
do?
this
comes
up
on
the
motion
to
dismiss
the
indictment
for
denial
of
a
speedy
trial.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
an
inside
value
have
been
denied
a
speedy
trial
but
i
think
you’re
going
to
trial
anyway.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
let’s
see.
is
the
government’s
position
then
in
any
instance
where
there’s
a
motion
to
dismiss
the
indictment
based
on
the
denial
of
a
speedy
trial
and
that
district
judge
determines
that
there
has
been
a
denial
of
a
speedy
trial
then
he
has
no
alternative
except
to
dismiss.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
all
right,
let’s
take
this
very
case
because
in
this
case
the
indictment
was
not
dismissed
by
the
trial
judge
he
went
to
trial
for
it.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
he
could
have
only
done
it
though
could
he
not
by
holding
it
there
was
no
denial
of
speedy
trial
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
mr.
reynolds
what
possible
remedy
can
there
be
other
than
dismissal
except
some
kind
of
amelioration
of
the
penalty
imposed
if
there’s
a
conviction.
what
possible,
what
other
alternative
is
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
i
know
but
what
--
take
what’s
going
to
be
the
usual
situation
not
the
peculiar
facts
of
this
case?
the
usual
situation
is
going
to
be
the
one
possibly
stated
by
mr.
stewart,
isn’t
it?
someone’s
going
to
claim
and
he’s
been
denied
a
speedy
trial.
he’s
going
to
make
a
motion
to
dismiss
the
indictment.
that’s
the
usual
case
that’s
going
to
come
up.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
there’s
going
to
be
determination
for
the
denial
of
a
speedy
trial.
now
what
you’re
saying
to
us
is
that,
rather
than
a
dismissal
there
may
be
some
flexibility
in
the
joints
which
will
permit
the
court
to
say
nevertheless
go
to
trial.
but
what’s
he
is
going
to
say
to
the
defendant?
“you’ve
been
denied
your
constitutional
right
to
a
speedy
trial
and
i’m
going
to
take
care
of
it”
how,
if
i’m
not
going
to
dismiss
the
indictment.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it’s
not,
mr.
reynolds,
i
forgot
does
your
brief
cite
us
any
cases
where
there
having
been
a
finding
of
a
denial
of
speedy
trial.
any
redress
like
except
dismissal
of
the
indictment
as
result.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
this
is
the
first
time
[voice

justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
know
other
things
that
concerns
me
is
if
what
you’re
proposing
whether
become
the
rule,
what
happens
in
the
most
in

districts
where
motions
are
heard
by
one
judge
and
he
finds
a
denial
of
a
speedy
trial

the
trial
itself
was
before

he
don’t
have
to
