mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
issue
in
this
case
concerns
the
nature
of
the
relief
that
can
properly
be
accorded
by
the
courts
upon
finding
a
violation
of
the
sixth
amendment
right
to
a
speedy
trial.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
your
honor,
i
think
that
this
court
could
appropriately
--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
i
don’t
believe
you
didn’t
take
the
case
for
that
purposes.
i’m
suggesting
that,
that
is
an
--
that
is
--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
that’s
correct.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
no
that’s,
that’s
--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
we
didn’t
--
that’s,
that’s
true
we
did
not
file.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
i
think
that
this
court
could
properly
make
that
decision.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
well,
we
do
address
ourselves
in
our
main
brief
to
the
principal
issue
and
we
did
not
as
you
might
now.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
well,
your
honor,
i’m
not
sure
that
we
can
anticipate
the
disposition
that
the
court’s
going
to
make.
i
think
that,
that’s
an
argument.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
well,
i
planned
to
address
myself
to
the
issue
of
the
remedy.
and
i
think
that,
that
issue
is
whether
the
remedy
of
the
court
of
appeals
can
properly
be
accorded
by
the
courts
on
a
finding
of
a
sixth
amendment
speedy
trial
violation.
and
that
fundamental
right
to
a
speedy
trial
has
for
many
years
been
defined
by
the
courts
in
absolute
terms.
that
is
that
it
requires
trial
within
a
specified
timeframe
or
that
it
can
be
evoked
only
after
a
speedy
trial
has
been
demanded
by
the
accused.
within
that
relatively
rigid
framework
the
finding
of
the
constitutional
violation
in
this
area
has
in
the
passed
almost
invariably
turned
on
one
of
two
considerations.
either
that
the
delay
in
bringing
the
case
to
trial
has
been
such
as
too
presumptively
or
actually
prejudiced
the
preparation
of
the
defense
of
the
case
or
that
the
delay
has
been
a
purpose
for
one
by
the
prosecutor
which
was
designed
against
some
tactical
advantage
over
the
accused.
now
in
both
of
those
situations
the
most
basic
notions
of
fundamental
fairness
dictate
a
dismissal
of
the
indictment
as
the
only
effective
remedy
for
enforcing
the
speedy
trial
right
and
that
not
surprisingly
has
hereto
for
been
the
uniform
response
to
the
finding
of
a
denial
of
the
constitutional
right
to
a
speedy
trial.
last
term,
however,
this
court
in
barker
versus
wingo
at
407
u.s.
examined
the
speedy
trial
guarantee
in
considerable
detail
and
concluded
that
the
right
did
not
by
nature
land
itself
to
any
mechanical
test
for
determining
when
it
had
been
violated.
thus,
the
court
as
mr.
justice
brennan
forecast
in
his
concurring
opinion
in
dickey
versus
florida,
the
court
announced
a
more
flexible
standard
for
ascertaining
whether
this
fundamental
right
has
been
infringed
in
the
circumstances
of
a
particular
case.
a
standard
based
on
a
careful
and
sensitive
balance
of
four
related
factors:
the
length
of
the
delay,
the
reason
for
the
delay,
the
assertion
by
the
defendant
of
his
right
to
a
speedy
trial,
and
the
prejudice
resulting
from
the
delay.
and
the
court
of
appeals
look
to
those
factors
in
the
present
case
and
it
found
on
a
balanced
of
those
factors
that
the
10-month
delay
here
between
indictment
and
trial
was
unconstitutional
in
the
particular
circumstances
involved
here.
the
counsel
for
petitioner
has
discussed
those
circumstances
already
and
i
don’t
think
there’s
any
need
to
go
into
them
in
any
detail
at
this
point.
i
think
the
important
thing
is
that
this
pretrial
delay
is
10-month
delay
and
this
is
agreed
to,
did
not
prejudice
the
defendant
in
the
preparation
of
this
defense
in
any
way.
there
is
no
claim
of
personal
prejudice
such
a
loss
of
liberty
or
employment
or
financial
resources
and
alike.
personal
prejudice
due
to
the
pretrial
incarceration
because
that
incarceration
was
in
the
nebraska
state
penal
complex
and
it
was
solely
related
to
this
state
conviction
for
he
was
serving
a
one
to
three-year
sentence
at
that
time.
and
it’s
also
not
asserted
that
the
pending
federal
indictment
adversely
affected
the
state
confinement
or
caused
him
any
mental
anguish
or
anxiety
that
would
accompanied
public
accusation
because
of
the
pending
indictment.
rather
the
only
prejudice
claimed
by
petitioner
and
the
only
prejudice
found
by
the
court
of
appeals
to
have
resulted
from
the
pretrial
delay
depended
on
a
concurrent
sentence
petitioner
received
following
his
direct
conviction.
thus,
on
the
basis
of
the
sentence
imposed
by
the
federal
judge
after
the
direct
conviction
on
hindsight
this
10-month
delay
cause
petitioner
to
lose
time
he
was
serving
on
his
state
sentence
that
would
otherwise
have
run
concurrently
with
the
federal
sentence.
now,
if
we
accept
the
court
of
appeals
decision
that
the
proper
balance
for
strunk
here
on
the
issue
of
whether
there
was
a
violation,
the
remedy
fashioned
by
the
court
which
petitioner
conceives
fully
cure
the
only
prejudice
suffered
by
crediting
him
with
the
time
of
pretrial
incarceration
between
indictment
and
arraignment.
that
remedy
we
submit
was
entirely
proper
to
the
extent
that
the
flexible
standard
announced
by
this
court
in
barker
versus
wingo
permits
a
finding
of
a
constitutional
speedy
trial
violation
on
facts
such
as
this.
so
to
flexibility
is
needed
in
the
remedy
phase
of
the
inquiry
so
that
in
appropriate
cases
the
courts
can
tailor
their
relief
to
the
infringement
they
find
needs
to
be
cured.
and
what
the
court
of
appeals
did
here
was
to
device
relief,
less
drastic
than
dismissal
of
the
indictment.
relief
which
fully
restored
petitioner
to
the
position
he
would
have
been
in
had
there
been
no
unreasonable
pretrial
delay.
by
giving
petitioner
credit
on
his
federal
sentence
for
his
incarceration
during
the
period
of
between
indictment
and
arraignment
the
court
fashioned
relief
to
vindicate
the
only
interest
of
the
accused
that
if
found
had
been
adversely
effected
by
the
sixth
amendment
violation.
moreover,
this
relief
served
far
better
than
with
dismissal
of
the
indictment
served
the
societal
interest
underlying
the
speedy
trial
provision.
public
concern
is
with
the
effective
prosecution
of
criminal
cases
with
reasonable
dispatch.
delays
can
often
work
to
the
government’s
disadvantage
by
reducing
its
capacity
to
try
the
--
to
prove
its
case.
where
however
the
prosecutions
case
remain
unimpaired
by
the
delay
as
here
and
where
there’s
been
no
prejudice
to
the
accused
in
the
sense
of
impairment
of
his
defense
or
in
the
sense
of
personal
prejudice
due
to
pretrial
incarceration
or
the
public
accusation
that
accompanies
return
of
indictment,
as
again
is
the
case
here.
then
society’s
interest
is
generally
best
served
by
allowing
the
case
to
proceed
to
trial
and
letting
the
jury
decide
whether
to
acquit
or
convict.
now,
there
is
the
obvious
exception
where
the
prosecutor
engages
in
purposeful
delay
to
gain
a
tactical
advantage.
as
mr.
justice
harlan
pointed
out
and
noting
such
official
misconduct
in
his
dissenting
opinion
in
chapman
versus
united
states
at
386
and
i
quote,
“society
can
not
tolerate
giving
final
effect
to
a
judgment
tainted
with
such
intentional
misconduct.”
but
there’s
no
such
official
abuse
of
the
criminal
process
involved
in
this
case
and
as
the
societal
interest
in
trying
people
accused
of
crime
is
served
best
not
by
granting
petitioner
immunization
because
of
legal
error
but
by
fashioning
a
sentence
as
did
the
court
of
appeals
to
cure
whatever
possible
prejudice
he
was
caused
by
the
unreasonable
delay.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
i’m
--
i
am
saying
your
honor
that
in
appropriate
cases
that
may
well
be
appropriate
relief.
i’m
suggesting
that
just
as
this
court
announced
an
ad
hoc
finding
or
ad
hoc
basis
for
looking
at
the
speedy
trial
violation
itself,
that
so
too
it’s
appropriate
to
have
the
district
courts
examine
the
various
factors
that
we’re
talking
about
--
that
the
court
was
talking
about
in
barker
versus
wingo.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
well,
of
course
the
determination
in
barker
versus
wingo
is
also
before
a
trial.
i
mean
that’s
when
those
factors
are
examined
by
the
district
courts
and
that’s
when
they
apply
those
same
factors.
it
was
based
on
the
--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
i
believe
that
was
counsel,
your
honor.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
it
was
prepared
by
counsel.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
it
had
been
--
if
this
motion
was
prepared
by
a
counsel.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
your
honor,
i
think
a
district
court
is
able
to
look
at
the
various
factors
such
as
prejudice
such
as
what
the
reasons
for
the
delay
was
and
including
a
personal
prejudice
as
discussed
in
marian
and
wingo
and
to
assess
on
the
basis
of
what
is
claimed
whether
or
not
you
can
appropriately
cure
the
prejudice
by
granting
relief
less
drastic
then
dismissal
that
i
think.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
that,
that
is
correct.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
your
honor,
i
think
that
district
judges
often
when
you
have
a
denial
of
a
constitutional
right
allow
a
case
to
go
to
trial
and
they
remedy
it
by
other
means.
the
exclusionary
rule
is
one
example
where
you
have
that.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
no
because
i
think
that
you’re
talking
about
the
type
of
prejudice
in
that
situation
or
right
to
counsel
or
coerce
--
let
me
have
exclude
coerce
confession
because
that’s
a
little
different
situation
but
there
you’re
talking
about
a
situation
where
your
prejudice
is
directly
to
whether
or
not
the
defendant
can
obtain
a
fair
trial.
and
--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
well,
it’s
whether
or
not
it
would
whether
fundamental
fairness
would
permit
putting
this
man
to
trial
a
second
time
for
the
same
offense.
now,
i
think
that
what
we’re
talking
about
here
that
there
is
no
fundamental
notion
of
fairness
that
would
preclude
trying
this
man
if
you
can
cure
the
only
prejudice
that
he
claims
he
suffered
by
giving
him
something
less
drastic
than
dismissal
of
the
indictment.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
but
we’re
not
talking
about
some
broad
expensive
exemption
to
the
remedy
of
the
dismissal.
what
we’re
talking
about
is
a
case
here
that
presents
a
factual
situation
permitting
a
remedy
less
drastic
than
dismissal.
that
there
was
formulated
by
the
court
of
appeals
then
we
think
on
this
facts
its
justified
we
think
that
it
may
well
be
that
in
other
cases
it
will
be
justified.
as
a
general
matter,
probably
in
most
situations
you
will
have
the
type
of
prejudice
to
the
defendant
that
will
not
permit
the
less
drastic
relief.
but
i
think
it’s
for
the
district
court
to
assess
in
the
same
way
that
it
has
to
make
the
ad
hoc
determination
prior
to
trial
on
the
basis
of
the
factors
announced
in
wingo
as
to
whether
there
is
a
speedy
trial
violation.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
no,
your
honor,
what
we
are
suggesting
--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
well,
i
think
that
that
would
be
impermissible
under
the
rule
that
we’re
suggesting
here.
what
we’re
doing
is
saying
that
the
remedy
is
determined
by
the
particular
nature
of
the
prejudice
claimed
and
shown.
now,
what,
we’re
not
suggesting
that
this
allowing
district
courts
to
forget
the
jury
at
a
speedy
trial
question
although
i
think
well
--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
well
i
think
the
courts
can
--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
a
district
judge,
just
can
i
believe
to
further
question
of
speedy
trial
until
after
trial
if
there’s
some
question
on
the
prejudicial
question
that’s
been
done
before
and
then
rule
it
on
there.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
and
he
does
not
feel
that
that
they
can
be
sure
--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
but
i’m
going
to
disregard
it.
i
think
that
would
be
an
improper
determination
by
the
district
judge.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
no,
it’s
relevant
as
to
what
the
basis
for
the
determination
of
a
speedy
trial
violation
is.
now,
barker
and
wingo
hadn’t
required
that
you
look
to
a
set
of
factors.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
i
think
that
the
trial
judge
in
this
case
could
have
affected
the
same
remedy
that
the
court
of
appeals
did
here.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
no,
i
think
that
he
could
have
held
that
we
will
allow
this
case
to
go
to
trial.
i
find
a
constitutional
violation
but
that
violation
can
be
fully
cured
by
giving
the
petitioner
here
the
defendant
credit
on
whatever
sentence
he
gets
in
the
event
of
a
conviction.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
well
that
basic
constitutional
question
is
going
to
be
decided
the
same
way
as
this
court
suggested
in
barker
versus
wingo.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
well,
i
--
i
think
--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
my
answer
is
i
think
that
the
court
just
as
a
court
if
it
finds
a
violation
under
the
forth
amendment
that
the
district
court
can
cure
that
violation
by
excluding
the
evidence
and
allowing
the
case
to
go
to
trial.
i
think
in
this
case,
if
the
district
court
had
found
on
a
balancing
of
the
factors
in
barker
versus
wingo
that
the
facts
of
this
case
may
have
a
constitutional
speedy
trial
violation.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
that’s
right
your
honor
appropriate
cases
there
can
be
a
remedy
other
than
dismissal.
and
i
think
that
--
i
don’t
think
that
there’s
anything
in
the
constitution
itself
which
says
dismissal
is
the
only
remedy.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
well,
here
is
a
remedy
that.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
and
there’s
going
to
be
a
factual
hearing
on
that
on
the
basis.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
in
this
case
the
court
takes
care
of
it.
well,
it’s
hard
in
the
abstract
to
talk
about
this
because
i
think
you
--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
that’s
what
i’ve
been
trying
to
say
but
i
understand
mr.
justice
brennan
i
was
trying
to
get
away
from
this
case.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
well,
i
think
that
that’s
if
there
is
an
--
if
the
speedy
trial
right
means
and
absolutely
nobody
can
be
tried
and
there
must
be
--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
but
i
don’t
think
your
honor
that
the
constitutional
right
is
an
absolute
one
that
requires
dismissal
of
the
indictment
whenever
a
violation
is
found.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
i
think
that
that’s
right,
oppressive
or
undue
pretrial
incarceration.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
that’s
right
but
if
you
have
near
those
situations
in
law.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
well,
i
think
in
those
circumstances
if
you
have
for
example
if
you
have
a
demand
by
the
accused
and
it
was
not
adhered
to,
the
dismissal
would
be
perhaps
the
appropriate
remedy
in
that
situation.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
that
–
yes,
your
honor,
that’s
what
we’re
saying
that
in
that
factual
situation
that
this
remedy
is
an
appropriate
one
and
that
it
does
cure
the
prejudice
resulting
from
the
delay.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
well
we
--
and
that
of
course
goes
back
to
why
we
did
present
the
argument
of
mr.
justice
brennan
that
this
factual
situation
was
one
where
i
think
that
prior
to
barker
versus
wingo
that
the
courts
would
not
have
found
a
speedy
trial
violation
on
the
facts
of
this
case.
i
think
that
barker
versus
wingo
added
a
great
deal
of
flexibility
in
terms
of
what
exactly
was
a
speedy
trial
violation.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
no
your
honor,
it
does
not.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
i
do
not
know
of
any
and
i
think
that
at
the
barker
versus
wingo
is
one
of
the
main
reasons
why
we
have
this
development.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
i
think
that
the
--
if
the
judge
who
hears
the
motion
for
instance
in
this
particular
case
had
ordered
that
there
would
be
credit
given
that
the
sentencing
judge
would
have
to
adhere
with
that
order.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
well,
because
he’s
ruled
as
matter
of
constitutional
law
that
the
way
to
redress
the
speedy
trial
violation
and
the
only
appropriate
way
is
to
give
him
credit
on
the
sentence.
now,
i
think
that
ruling
would
be
binding
as
a
constitutional
ruling.
it
will
be
binding
on
the
trial
judge,
the
same
extent
that
a
ruling
for
excluding
evidence
by
one
judge
on
a
motion
that
would
be
binding
on
the
trial
judge
who
heard
the
trial.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
well,
i
--
but
i
don’t
think
that,
i
think
here
you
got
a
ruling
--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
i
think
they
would
be
bound
by
the
prior
constitutional
ruling
of
district
judge
who
heard
the
motion.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
well,
it
indicates
that
that’s
one
of
the
dangers
that
the
courts
are
feeling
that
the
remedy
is
so
severe
might
be
inclined
not
defined
a
speedy
trial
violation.
and
i
think
that
the
court
of
appeals
faced
with
that
possibility
made
a
very
conscientious
and
careful
effort
to
deal
with
the
subject
in
light
of
barker
and
wingo,
and
that
with
the
new
flexibility
it
did
device
a
remedy
which
was
warranted
on
the
basis
of
the
prejudice
here.
thank
you.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
issue
in
this
case
concerns
the
nature
of
the
relief
that
can
properly
be
accorded
by
the
courts
upon
finding
a
violation
of
the
sixth
amendment
right
to
a
speedy
trial.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
your
honor,
i
think
that
this
court
could
appropriately
--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
i
don’t
believe
you
didn’t
take
the
case
for
that
purposes.
i’m
suggesting
that,
that
is
an
--
that
is
--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
that’s
correct.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
no
that’s,
that’s
--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
we
didn’t
--
that’s,
that’s
true
we
did
not
file.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
i
think
that
this
court
could
properly
make
that
decision.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
well,
we
do
address
ourselves
in
our
main
brief
to
the
principal
issue
and
we
did
not
as
you
might
now.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
well,
your
honor,
i’m
not
sure
that
we
can
anticipate
the
disposition
that
the
court’s
going
to
make.
i
think
that,
that’s
an
argument.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
well,
i
planned
to
address
myself
to
the
issue
of
the
remedy.
and
i
think
that,
that
issue
is
whether
the
remedy
of
the
court
of
appeals
can
properly
be
accorded
by
the
courts
on
a
finding
of
a
sixth
amendment
speedy
trial
violation.
and
that
fundamental
right
to
a
speedy
trial
has
for
many
years
been
defined
by
the
courts
in
absolute
terms.
that
is
that
it
requires
trial
within
a
specified
timeframe
or
that
it
can
be
evoked
only
after
a
speedy
trial
has
been
demanded
by
the
accused.
within
that
relatively
rigid
framework
the
finding
of
the
constitutional
violation
in
this
area
has
in
the
passed
almost
invariably
turned
on
one
of
two
considerations.
either
that
the
delay
in
bringing
the
case
to
trial
has
been
such
as
too
presumptively
or
actually
prejudiced
the
preparation
of
the
defense
of
the
case
or
that
the
delay
has
been
a
purpose
for
one
by
the
prosecutor
which
was
designed
against
some
tactical
advantage
over
the
accused.
now
in
both
of
those
situations
the
most
basic
notions
of
fundamental
fairness
dictate
a
dismissal
of
the
indictment
as
the
only
effective
remedy
for
enforcing
the
speedy
trial
right
and
that
not
surprisingly
has
hereto
for
been
the
uniform
response
to
the
finding
of
a
denial
of
the
constitutional
right
to
a
speedy
trial.
last
term,
however,
this
court
in
barker
versus
wingo
at
407
u.s.
examined
the
speedy
trial
guarantee
in
considerable
detail
and
concluded
that
the
right
did
not
by
nature
land
itself
to
any
mechanical
test
for
determining
when
it
had
been
violated.
thus,
the
court
as
mr.
justice
brennan
forecast
in
his
concurring
opinion
in
dickey
versus
florida,
the
court
announced
a
more
flexible
standard
for
ascertaining
whether
this
fundamental
right
has
been
infringed
in
the
circumstances
of
a
particular
case.
a
standard
based
on
a
careful
and
sensitive
balance
of
four
related
factors:
the
length
of
the
delay,
the
reason
for
the
delay,
the
assertion
by
the
defendant
of
his
right
to
a
speedy
trial,
and
the
prejudice
resulting
from
the
delay.
and
the
court
of
appeals
look
to
those
factors
in
the
present
case
and
it
found
on
a
balanced
of
those
factors
that
the
10-month
delay
here
between
indictment
and
trial
was
unconstitutional
in
the
particular
circumstances
involved
here.
the
counsel
for
petitioner
has
discussed
those
circumstances
already
and
i
don’t
think
there’s
any
need
to
go
into
them
in
any
detail
at
this
point.
i
think
the
important
thing
is
that
this
pretrial
delay
is
10-month
delay
and
this
is
agreed
to,
did
not
prejudice
the
defendant
in
the
preparation
of
this
defense
in
any
way.
there
is
no
claim
of
personal
prejudice
such
a
loss
of
liberty
or
employment
or
financial
resources
and
alike.
personal
prejudice
due
to
the
pretrial
incarceration
because
that
incarceration
was
in
the
nebraska
state
penal
complex
and
it
was
solely
related
to
this
state
conviction
for
he
was
serving
a
one
to
three-year
sentence
at
that
time.
and
it’s
also
not
asserted
that
the
pending
federal
indictment
adversely
affected
the
state
confinement
or
caused
him
any
mental
anguish
or
anxiety
that
would
accompanied
public
accusation
because
of
the
pending
indictment.
rather
the
only
prejudice
claimed
by
petitioner
and
the
only
prejudice
found
by
the
court
of
appeals
to
have
resulted
from
the
pretrial
delay
depended
on
a
concurrent
sentence
petitioner
received
following
his
direct
conviction.
thus,
on
the
basis
of
the
sentence
imposed
by
the
federal
judge
after
the
direct
conviction
on
hindsight
this
10-month
delay
cause
petitioner
to
lose
time
he
was
serving
on
his
state
sentence
that
would
otherwise
have
run
concurrently
with
the
federal
sentence.
now,
if
we
accept
the
court
of
appeals
decision
that
the
proper
balance
for
strunk
here
on
the
issue
of
whether
there
was
a
violation,
the
remedy
fashioned
by
the
court
which
petitioner
conceives
fully
cure
the
only
prejudice
suffered
by
crediting
him
with
the
time
of
pretrial
incarceration
between
indictment
and
arraignment.
that
remedy
we
submit
was
entirely
proper
to
the
extent
that
the
flexible
standard
announced
by
this
court
in
barker
versus
wingo
permits
a
finding
of
a
constitutional
speedy
trial
violation
on
facts
such
as
this.
so
to
flexibility
is
needed
in
the
remedy
phase
of
the
inquiry
so
that
in
appropriate
cases
the
courts
can
tailor
their
relief
to
the
infringement
they
find
needs
to
be
cured.
and
what
the
court
of
appeals
did
here
was
to
device
relief,
less
drastic
than
dismissal
of
the
indictment.
relief
which
fully
restored
petitioner
to
the
position
he
would
have
been
in
had
there
been
no
unreasonable
pretrial
delay.
by
giving
petitioner
credit
on
his
federal
sentence
for
his
incarceration
during
the
period
of
between
indictment
and
arraignment
the
court
fashioned
relief
to
vindicate
the
only
interest
of
the
accused
that
if
found
had
been
adversely
effected
by
the
sixth
amendment
violation.
moreover,
this
relief
served
far
better
than
with
dismissal
of
the
indictment
served
the
societal
interest
underlying
the
speedy
trial
provision.
public
concern
is
with
the
effective
prosecution
of
criminal
cases
with
reasonable
dispatch.
delays
can
often
work
to
the
government’s
disadvantage
by
reducing
its
capacity
to
try
the
--
to
prove
its
case.
where
however
the
prosecutions
case
remain
unimpaired
by
the
delay
as
here
and
where
there’s
been
no
prejudice
to
the
accused
in
the
sense
of
impairment
of
his
defense
or
in
the
sense
of
personal
prejudice
due
to
pretrial
incarceration
or
the
public
accusation
that
accompanies
return
of
indictment,
as
again
is
the
case
here.
then
society’s
interest
is
generally
best
served
by
allowing
the
case
to
proceed
to
trial
and
letting
the
jury
decide
whether
to
acquit
or
convict.
now,
there
is
the
obvious
exception
where
the
prosecutor
engages
in
purposeful
delay
to
gain
a
tactical
advantage.
as
mr.
justice
harlan
pointed
out
and
noting
such
official
misconduct
in
his
dissenting
opinion
in
chapman
versus
united
states
at
386
and
i
quote,
“society
can
not
tolerate
giving
final
effect
to
a
judgment
tainted
with
such
intentional
misconduct.”
but
there’s
no
such
official
abuse
of
the
criminal
process
involved
in
this
case
and
as
the
societal
interest
in
trying
people
accused
of
crime
is
served
best
not
by
granting
petitioner
immunization
because
of
legal
error
but
by
fashioning
a
sentence
as
did
the
court
of
appeals
to
cure
whatever
possible
prejudice
he
was
caused
by
the
unreasonable
delay.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
i’m
--
i
am
saying
your
honor
that
in
appropriate
cases
that
may
well
be
appropriate
relief.
i’m
suggesting
that
just
as
this
court
announced
an
ad
hoc
finding
or
ad
hoc
basis
for
looking
at
the
speedy
trial
violation
itself,
that
so
too
it’s
appropriate
to
have
the
district
courts
examine
the
various
factors
that
we’re
talking
about
--
that
the
court
was
talking
about
in
barker
versus
wingo.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
well,
of
course
the
determination
in
barker
versus
wingo
is
also
before
a
trial.
i
mean
that’s
when
those
factors
are
examined
by
the
district
courts
and
that’s
when
they
apply
those
same
factors.
it
was
based
on
the
--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
i
believe
that
was
counsel,
your
honor.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
it
was
prepared
by
counsel.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
it
had
been
--
if
this
motion
was
prepared
by
a
counsel.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
your
honor,
i
think
a
district
court
is
able
to
look
at
the
various
factors
such
as
prejudice
such
as
what
the
reasons
for
the
delay
was
and
including
a
personal
prejudice
as
discussed
in
marian
and
wingo
and
to
assess
on
the
basis
of
what
is
claimed
whether
or
not
you
can
appropriately
cure
the
prejudice
by
granting
relief
less
drastic
then
dismissal
that
i
think.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
that,
that
is
correct.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
your
honor,
i
think
that
district
judges
often
when
you
have
a
denial
of
a
constitutional
right
allow
a
case
to
go
to
trial
and
they
remedy
it
by
other
means.
the
exclusionary
rule
is
one
example
where
you
have
that.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
no
because
i
think
that
you’re
talking
about
the
type
of
prejudice
in
that
situation
or
right
to
counsel
or
coerce
--
let
me
have
exclude
coerce
confession
because
that’s
a
little
different
situation
but
there
you’re
talking
about
a
situation
where
your
prejudice
is
directly
to
whether
or
not
the
defendant
can
obtain
a
fair
trial.
and
--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
well,
it’s
whether
or
not
it
would
whether
fundamental
fairness
would
permit
putting
this
man
to
trial
a
second
time
for
the
same
offense.
now,
i
think
that
what
we’re
talking
about
here
that
there
is
no
fundamental
notion
of
fairness
that
would
preclude
trying
this
man
if
you
can
cure
the
only
prejudice
that
he
claims
he
suffered
by
giving
him
something
less
drastic
than
dismissal
of
the
indictment.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
but
we’re
not
talking
about
some
broad
expensive
exemption
to
the
remedy
of
the
dismissal.
what
we’re
talking
about
is
a
case
here
that
presents
a
factual
situation
permitting
a
remedy
less
drastic
than
dismissal.
that
there
was
formulated
by
the
court
of
appeals
then
we
think
on
this
facts
its
justified
we
think
that
it
may
well
be
that
in
other
cases
it
will
be
justified.
as
a
general
matter,
probably
in
most
situations
you
will
have
the
type
of
prejudice
to
the
defendant
that
will
not
permit
the
less
drastic
relief.
but
i
think
it’s
for
the
district
court
to
assess
in
the
same
way
that
it
has
to
make
the
ad
hoc
determination
prior
to
trial
on
the
basis
of
the
factors
announced
in
wingo
as
to
whether
there
is
a
speedy
trial
violation.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
no,
your
honor,
what
we
are
suggesting
--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
well,
i
think
that
that
would
be
impermissible
under
the
rule
that
we’re
suggesting
here.
what
we’re
doing
is
saying
that
the
remedy
is
determined
by
the
particular
nature
of
the
prejudice
claimed
and
shown.
now,
what,
we’re
not
suggesting
that
this
allowing
district
courts
to
forget
the
jury
at
a
speedy
trial
question
although
i
think
well
--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
well
i
think
the
courts
can
--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
a
district
judge,
just
can
i
believe
to
further
question
of
speedy
trial
until
after
trial
if
there’s
some
question
on
the
prejudicial
question
that’s
been
done
before
and
then
rule
it
on
there.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
and
he
does
not
feel
that
that
they
can
be
sure
--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
but
i’m
going
to
disregard
it.
i
think
that
would
be
an
improper
determination
by
the
district
judge.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
no,
it’s
relevant
as
to
what
the
basis
for
the
determination
of
a
speedy
trial
violation
is.
now,
barker
and
wingo
hadn’t
required
that
you
look
to
a
set
of
factors.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
i
think
that
the
trial
judge
in
this
case
could
have
affected
the
same
remedy
that
the
court
of
appeals
did
here.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
no,
i
think
that
he
could
have
held
that
we
will
allow
this
case
to
go
to
trial.
i
find
a
constitutional
violation
but
that
violation
can
be
fully
cured
by
giving
the
petitioner
here
the
defendant
credit
on
whatever
sentence
he
gets
in
the
event
of
a
conviction.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
well
that
basic
constitutional
question
is
going
to
be
decided
the
same
way
as
this
court
suggested
in
barker
versus
wingo.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
well,
i
--
i
think
--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
my
answer
is
i
think
that
the
court
just
as
a
court
if
it
finds
a
violation
under
the
forth
amendment
that
the
district
court
can
cure
that
violation
by
excluding
the
evidence
and
allowing
the
case
to
go
to
trial.
i
think
in
this
case,
if
the
district
court
had
found
on
a
balancing
of
the
factors
in
barker
versus
wingo
that
the
facts
of
this
case
may
have
a
constitutional
speedy
trial
violation.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
that’s
right
your
honor
appropriate
cases
there
can
be
a
remedy
other
than
dismissal.
and
i
think
that
--
i
don’t
think
that
there’s
anything
in
the
constitution
itself
which
says
dismissal
is
the
only
remedy.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
well,
here
is
a
remedy
that.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
and
there’s
going
to
be
a
factual
hearing
on
that
on
the
basis.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
in
this
case
the
court
takes
care
of
it.
well,
it’s
hard
in
the
abstract
to
talk
about
this
because
i
think
you
--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
that’s
what
i’ve
been
trying
to
say
but
i
understand
mr.
justice
brennan
i
was
trying
to
get
away
from
this
case.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
well,
i
think
that
that’s
if
there
is
an
--
if
the
speedy
trial
right
means
and
absolutely
nobody
can
be
tried
and
there
must
be
--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
but
i
don’t
think
your
honor
that
the
constitutional
right
is
an
absolute
one
that
requires
dismissal
of
the
indictment
whenever
a
violation
is
found.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
i
think
that
that’s
right,
oppressive
or
undue
pretrial
incarceration.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
that’s
right
but
if
you
have
near
those
situations
in
law.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
well,
i
think
in
those
circumstances
if
you
have
for
example
if
you
have
a
demand
by
the
accused
and
it
was
not
adhered
to,
the
dismissal
would
be
perhaps
the
appropriate
remedy
in
that
situation.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
that
–
yes,
your
honor,
that’s
what
we’re
saying
that
in
that
factual
situation
that
this
remedy
is
an
appropriate
one
and
that
it
does
cure
the
prejudice
resulting
from
the
delay.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
well
we
--
and
that
of
course
goes
back
to
why
we
did
present
the
argument
of
mr.
justice
brennan
that
this
factual
situation
was
one
where
i
think
that
prior
to
barker
versus
wingo
that
the
courts
would
not
have
found
a
speedy
trial
violation
on
the
facts
of
this
case.
i
think
that
barker
versus
wingo
added
a
great
deal
of
flexibility
in
terms
of
what
exactly
was
a
speedy
trial
violation.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
no
your
honor,
it
does
not.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
i
do
not
know
of
any
and
i
think
that
at
the
barker
versus
wingo
is
one
of
the
main
reasons
why
we
have
this
development.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
i
think
that
the
--
if
the
judge
who
hears
the
motion
for
instance
in
this
particular
case
had
ordered
that
there
would
be
credit
given
that
the
sentencing
judge
would
have
to
adhere
with
that
order.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
well,
because
he’s
ruled
as
matter
of
constitutional
law
that
the
way
to
redress
the
speedy
trial
violation
and
the
only
appropriate
way
is
to
give
him
credit
on
the
sentence.
now,
i
think
that
ruling
would
be
binding
as
a
constitutional
ruling.
it
will
be
binding
on
the
trial
judge,
the
same
extent
that
a
ruling
for
excluding
evidence
by
one
judge
on
a
motion
that
would
be
binding
on
the
trial
judge
who
heard
the
trial.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
well,
i
--
but
i
don’t
think
that,
i
think
here
you
got
a
ruling
--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
i
think
they
would
be
bound
by
the
prior
constitutional
ruling
of
district
judge
who
heard
the
motion.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
well,
it
indicates
that
that’s
one
of
the
dangers
that
the
courts
are
feeling
that
the
remedy
is
so
severe
might
be
inclined
not
defined
a
speedy
trial
violation.
and
i
think
that
the
court
of
appeals
faced
with
that
possibility
made
a
very
conscientious
and
careful
effort
to
deal
with
the
subject
in
light
of
barker
and
wingo,
and
that
with
the
new
flexibility
it
did
device
a
remedy
which
was
warranted
on
the
basis
of
the
prejudice
here.
thank
you.
