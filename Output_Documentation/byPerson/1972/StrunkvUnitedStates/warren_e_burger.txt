we’ll
hear
arguments
next
in
72-5521,
strunk
against
the
united
states.
mr.
wideikis,
you
may
proceed
when
you’re
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
how
long
after
the
indictment
did
that
occur?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
this
is
pre-indictment.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
it
correct
that
an
about
2-1/2
months
more
or
less
was
delayed
by
reason
of
this
discussion
of
plea
of
nolo
contendere?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
were
they
referring
to
nebraska’s
incarceration
of
him?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
he
was
in
the
nebraska
state
penitentiary
awaiting
trial,
was
he
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
yes
but
he
was
in
nebraska’s
custody.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now
did
the
court
of
appeals
think
this
was
an
oppressive
custody
on
him.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
did
that
rest
on
an
independent
conviction
in
the
state
of
nebraska
in
the
state
courts?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
no,
i’m
speaking
of
the
custody
--
nebraska’s
custody
of
this
man
before
trial
was
based
upon
a
conviction
in
nebraska
for
a
state
defense
in
the
state
courts
or
have
i
misread
the
record?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
the
court
of
appeals
viewed
that
as
an
oppressive
custody
in
the
context
of
the
federal
case.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
would
be
on
an
assumption
that
sentence
was
going
to
be
concurrent,
wouldn’t
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
no
one
knew
that
there
is
a
chance.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
with
your
--
in
your
view
if
in
fact
the
prosecutor
assigned
a
higher
priority
to
take
their
terms
to
people
who
were
being
held
in
custody
without
bond
waiting
trial
would
you
consider
that
an
invalid
priority
assignment
as
compared
with
this
man
in
a
state
prison
under
conviction
in
another
charge.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
i’m
just
asking
you
whether
in
your
view
it
would
the
–
any
priority
would
be
invalid
at
all.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you.
mr.
reynolds.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
could
understand
mr.
reynolds
your
position
if
your
were
saying
that
the
district
judge
reach
the
conclusion
that
this
is
a
very
close
question
and
i
can’t
--
he
says
to
himself
“i
can’t
decide
it
right
now
i’m
going
to
let
it
go
to
trial
and
if
i
conclude
that
there
was
no
denial
that
there
was
a
problem
about
the
case
perhaps
deal
with
this
remedial
device.”
but
if
you
have
this
remedial
device
as
in
automatic
alternative,
aren’t
you
going
to
have
a
lot
of
problems
about
deciding
the
basic
constitutional
question?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
that
assumes
that
are
multiple
remedies
for
the
denial
of
a
speedy
trial
and
not
just
one
remedy.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
are
you
are
saying
that
since
the
only
prejudice
that
could
conceivably
result
in
a
smith-hooey
type
or
this
type
of
case
goes
to
the
length
of
confinement
that
in
that
particular
case,
you
carve
out
a
special
remedy
and
you
deal
with
the
delay
by
the
special
remedy,
is
that
your
argument?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
perhaps,
you
can
inherent
in
your
position
as
the
idea
that
there
may
be
some
delays
which
are
not
quite
constitutional
but
ought
to
be
remedied.
perhaps
that’s
inherent
in
your
--
the
facts
of
this
case.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
reynolds.
do
you
have
in
any
further?
very
well.
