mr.
angelo
ruggiero
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
like
to
start
my
argument
before
this
court
to
get
to
certain
aspects
of
the
facts
as
they
evolved
in
this
mara
case.
the
government
has
just
conceded
the
point
that
this
was
not
a
special
grand
jury
that
mara
was
called
before,
it
was
just
an
ordinary
grand
jury.
he
appeared
in
the
us
attorney’s
office
in
chicago
on
two
separate
occasions.
he
was
asked
for
his
handwriting
exemplars
not
by
the
grand
jury
or
the
foreman
to
the
grand
jury,
but
by
the
us
attorney.
he
was
asked
to
return
to
the
grand
jury.
he
was
asked
again
by
the
us
attorney,
the
assistant
in
the
grand
jury
room
to
supply
these
handwriting
exemplars.
and
upon
his
refusal
to
do
so
on
constitutional
grounds,
the
us
attorney
directed
the
foreman
of
the
grand
jury
to
direct
the
witness
to
supply
the
handwriting
exemplars
and
that's
how
that
it
came
--
there
came
about
the
petition,
then
before
the
district
courts
at
(inaudible)
in
our
district
and
the
order,
the
petition
which
is
set
forth
in
the
appendix
asked
for
the
giving
of
these
handwriting
exemplars.
to
this
day,
we
do
not
know
what
is
in
that
affidavit
which
was
submitted
in
camera
to
judge
robson.
the
first
that
the
witness
or
his
counsel
knew
of
what
--
some
semblance
of
what
was
in
that
affidavit
is
what
was
set
forth
in
the
circuit
court
of
appeals'
opinion
wherein
they
stated
that
the
contents
of
affidavit
were
solely
the
work
product
of
an
fbi
agent,
the
sole
product
of
an
fbi
agent,
and
that
it
was
investigation
which
occurred
outside
the
scope
of
a
grand
jury.
mara
was
not
afforded
an
opportunity
of
counsel.
no
kind
of
procedure
was
afforded
him
outside
the
grand
jury
room
wherein
and
whereby
he
would
give
exemplars
to
a
fbi
agent.
we
do
not
know
whether
or
not
the
fbi
agent
was
the
duly
designated
authorized
agent
of
a
grand
jury
and
in
that
posture,
that
is
how
that
case
came
before
the
us
court
of
appeals,
and
it
is
now
presently
before
this
court.
we
do
not,
that
is
mara,
we
do
not
concede
that
the
exemplars
sought
by
the
government
are
non-testimonial
or
non-communicative
because
we
just
do
not
know.
we
have
no
ideas,
i've
stated
this
to
what
in
these
affidavits.
it
well
might
be
that
what
this
grand
jury
or
precisely
what
the
government
wanted
was
a
matter
which
was
essentially
germane
to
the
government’s
case
and
to
prove
a
case
against
mara
because
as
they
stated
in
their
petition
for
order,
he
was
a
potential
defendant
in
an
investigation
with
reference
to
the
statutes
involved.
mr.
angelo
ruggiero
i
don’t
know.
i
don’t
know
mr.
chief
justice.
i
just
don’t
know.
i
operate
here
as
i
stand
before
this
court
in
the
vacuum.
this
is
an
affidavit
and
i've
repeated
for
the
third
time
and
that’s
been
the
issue
before
the
--
mr.
angelo
ruggiero
--
district
court.
mr.
angelo
ruggiero
my
position
would
be
that
if
what
he
is
asked
to
write
down
is
germane
or
essential
to
the
government’s
case
to
prove
its
case,
then
i
would
--
my
position
would
be
the
same,
yes.
mr.
angelo
ruggiero
yes,
i
do
your
honor.
firstly,
it’s
a
two-prong
argument
there.
firstly,
we
don’t
know
if
it's
not
--
first
of
all
we
don't
know
if
it's
testimonial
or
communicative;
and
secondly,
even
if
it
were,
it
would
apply
–
if
it's
selectively
germane
to
the
government’s
case,
whereas
they
need
that
to
make
their
case.
mr.
angelo
ruggiero
that’s
--
this
is
exactly
what
we
are
talking
about
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
this
is
exactly
what
i
am
talking
about,
the
fifth
amendment.
mr.
angelo
ruggiero
that
is
correct.
we
didn’t
get
that
far.
he
was
--
we
were
asked
to
give
it
--
he
was
asked
to
give
an
exemplar.
in
my
recollection,
we
were
never
told
what
it
was
and
on
that
basis
upon
refusal
on
the
grounds
as
is
mention
in
our
briefs,
the
fourth,
the
fifth,
we
even
raise
the
sixth
amendment
and
the
abuse
of
the
grand
jury
as
we
did
here.
on
that
basis,
we
went
before
the
lower
--
the
government
went
before
the
lower
district
court
and
an
answer
to
the
government’s
argument
is
before
judge
robson.
we
never
got
an
opportunity
to
argue
other
than
the
fourth
amendment
problem,
that
is
that
affidavit
because
judge
robson
and
its
in
the
appendix
in
the
colloquy
between
myself
and
judge
robson
stated
that
it
was
his
opinion
that
the
constitutional
ground
is
raised
and
because
of
that
affidavit
that
he
had
to
give,
that
is
mara
had
to
give
the
exemplars.
we
never
got
beyond
that
point
and
it
is
about
a
10-page
paragraph
in
the
appendix.
so
we
never
got
into
the
other
issues
as
to
the
fifth,
the
sixth
and
the
abuse
of
the
grand
jury.
it
was
his
opinion
and
that
was
it.
we
do
not
as
i
stated,
concede
that
these
are
non-testimonial
and
non-communicative
exemplars
because
we
do
not
know.
we
also
do
not
concede
that
gilbert
--
i
don’t
believe
that
gilbert
or
wade
state
that
handwriting
exemplars
do
not
fall
within
the
preview
of
the
fifth
amendment
because
gilbert
did
not
raise
the
content
of
the
exemplar.
gilbert
only
said
that
exemplars,
handwriting
exemplars
are
not
within
the
preview
of
fifth
amendment.
we
do
raise
that
question
here
before
this
court.
we
raise
the
content.
we
raise
the
testimonial
and
communicative
nature
of
the
exemplars
before
this
court
because
if
it
is
selectively
germane
to
proving
the
government
case
then
the
fifth
amendment
would
apply.
and
this,
of
course,
would
dovetail
into
the
fourth
amendment
as
it
applies
here
because
of
the
affidavit
would
which
was
submitted
in
camera.
mr.
angelo
ruggiero
i
would
agree,
your
honor,
that’s
true
and
that’s
what
he
should
do,
but
he
was
asked
for
exemplars
and
as
i
stated,
i
don’t
--
we
don’t
know
what
he
was
ask
to
give.
he
was
ask
to
give
certain
exemplars.
he
refused
to
do
so
based
upon
as
i
stated
his
constitutional
rights.
mr.
angelo
ruggiero
if
it
is
something
which
again
is
selectively
germane,
it
is
essential
to
the
government’s
proof
in
a
case
then
i
say
that
the
fifth
amendment
would
apply
because
--
mr.
angelo
ruggiero
we
--
well,
i
don’t
know.
we
don’t
know.
mr.
angelo
ruggiero
that
is
the
case
that
is
before
this
court
now.
mr.
angelo
ruggiero
it
is
not
irrelevant
mr.
chief
justice,
if
in
the
posture
the
question
that
is
put
forth,
if
he
is
asked
certain
questions
about,
for
instance,
this
case
whether
or
not
it
is
a
hijack
case
or
a
conspiracy
case
and
certain
questions
along
that
line,
in
the
posture
of
the
case
and
the
questions
that
maybe
asked
may
show
that
what
they
are
asking
for
is
that
selectively
germane
thing
that
they
want,
the
essential
to
prove
their
case.
mr.
angelo
ruggiero
sure.
mr.
angelo
ruggiero
if
they
are
used
to
prove
a
forgery
or
perhaps
in
this
case
to
prove
a
receipt,
the
signing
of
the
receipt
for
the
--
mr.
angelo
ruggiero
no,
it
is
not.
not
this
particular
case.
mr.
angelo
ruggiero
no,
no.
not
this
case
your
honor.
this
case
has
to
do
with
as
interstate
shipping,
as
it's
commonly
known
as
hijack.
mr.
angelo
ruggiero
that’s
--
mr.
angelo
ruggiero
that’s
the
issue.
if
they
need
his
signature
or
whatever
it
is
that
they
are
seeking
to
state
that
he
is
the
individual
that
signed
this
invoice
or
this
check
or
this
receipt
then
i
think
that
is
what
i
would
call
selectively
germane
to
prove
their
case.
i
mean,
i
don’t
think
there's
any
doubt
that
if
they
came
to
mara
and
asked
him,
“did
you
sign
this
receipt,
that
he
could
assert
his
privilege
under
the
fifth
amendment.
i
don’t
think
there
is
any
question
about
that.
mr.
angelo
ruggiero
that’s
another
question
and
which
is
something
incidentally
that
the
court
of
appeals
suggested
that
they
do
do,
is
to
go
and
get
their
investigation
and
what
seems
to
be,
what
they
did
in
their
affidavit.
mr.
angelo
ruggiero
they
could
do
that.
i
would
say
that
they
could
do
that.
mr.
angelo
ruggiero
but
there's
a
question
mr.
chief
justice
between
asking
a
man
to
come
in
the
grand
jury
room
or
the
us
attorney
and
asking
him
to
write
his
name
and
go
into
a
bank
and
getting
his
signature
from
a
bank.
mr.
angelo
ruggiero
yes,
it
is.
to
me
it
is
and
if
it
all
--
as
i
said,
comes
down
to
the
fourth
amendment
question
in
my
argument
is
to
the
probable
cause
because
of
the
affidavit.
and
the
government
seems
to
take
the
tag
that
that
there
should
be
at
least
as
to
a
showing,
as
to
a
hearing
ex-parte
as
there
would
be
in
search
warrant.
but
i
know
of
no
case
or
an
arrest
warrant,
i
know
of
no
case
that
has
been
cited
to
me
or
that
i've
read
or
anybody
has
called
to
my
attention,
where
an
individual
in
a
search
or
an
arrest
warrant
cannot
see
that
affidavit
in
an
effort
to
suppress
or
to
quash
it,
i
know
of
no
case.
in
this
particular
instance,
we
have
never
been
allowed
to
see
that
affidavit.
we
just
--
we’re
here
in
limbo.
we
don’t
know,
what's
involved.
if
that
is
the
government’s
position,
i
should
think
that
we
would
be
entitled
to
look
at
that
affidavit
to
see
if
there
is
anything
in
it
which
would
be
akin
to
probable
cause.
mr.
angelo
ruggiero
no.
mr.
angelo
ruggiero
no,
your
honor,
no.
mr.
angelo
ruggiero
the
difference
is
that
the
witnesses
have
appeared
before
that
court,
excuse
me,
before
the
grand
jury.
they
haven't
here.
no
such
thing
occurred
here.
nobody
appeared
before
--
mr.
angelo
ruggiero
the
difference
is
because
it's
based
upon
an
affidavit
submitted
by
an
fbi
agent
and
we
have
rules
of
procedure
in
cases
from
this
court,
would
set
forth
the
procedure
within
the
limits
of
a
fourth
amendment.
that
says
that
either
in
searches
and
seizures,
no
unreasonable
searches
and
seizures
and
no
probable
cause,
there
has
to
be
probable
cause.
no
search
warrants
without
probable
cause,
that’s
the
difference.
mr.
angelo
ruggiero
that’s
true,
that
is
true.
the
question
is
to
the
unreasonableness,
i
would
leave
to
my
colleague
on
my
left,
as
to
the
unreasonable
in
the
fourth
amendment
questions.
the
issue
with
the
grand
jury
here
and
the
abuse
of
the
grand
jury
is
one
i
think
that
in
the
times
today
calls
for
an
important
expression
by
this
court.
you
have
here
--
you
had
in
the
situation,
in
the
mara
situation,
a
united
states
attorney
who
is
directing
what
is
grand
jury
used
to
do.
all
of
the
questions
directed
to
the
mara,
all
of
the
information
sought
from
him
was
asked
for
him
not
by
a
grand
jury
but
by
a
us
attorney.
now
what
in
effect
has
occurred
in
the
mara
case
exactly
is
that
the
grand
jury
has
become
an
arm,
an
investigative
arm
of
the
us
government.
and
i
think
that
in
view
of
the
cases
that
have
come
down
and
i
take
to
heart
the
statement
and
the
speech
given
by
our
chief
judge
campbell,
who
was
then
chief
judge,
he
is
since
retired,
who
gave
a
talk
before
the
federal
judicial
center.
chief
judge
campbell
was
a
judge
in
our
court
for
some
32
years
and
for
many
years,
he
reigned
as
the
chief
judge
and
he
knew
a
little
about
grand
juries
and
their
operations
and
what
occurred
and
it
was
his
opinion
in
that
speech
that
grand
jury
should
be
abolished
because
any
us
attorney
who
deems
it
necessary,
can
indict
anybody
for
any
reason
whatsoever.
and
that
the
grand
jury
does
not
function
today
as
an
arm
to
stand
between
the
accused
and
the
accuser
and
on
that
basis,
it
should
be
abolished
and
i
concur
in
that
expression,
especially
in
view
of
what
has
occurred
in
this
case.
if
this
grand
jury
had
been
investigated
solely
on
its
own
basis,
had
been
directing
questions,
had
been
asking
questions,
was
seeking
information
on
its
own
that
would
be
one
question,
but
it
was
not.
this
grand
jury
was
acting
under
the
authority
of
the
assistant
attorney,
us
attorney,
in
that
courtroom
and
he
was
directing
the
operations
in
that
courtroom.
i
think
that,
it
is
time
that
we
have
some
expression
from
this
court
as
to
what
the
functions,
again
of
a
grand
jury
should
be
relative
to
this
kind
of
situation.
the
preliminary
--
mr.
angelo
ruggiero
i'm
sorry.
i
didn’t
see
the
white
light.
thank
you.
mr.
angelo
ruggiero
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
like
to
start
my
argument
before
this
court
to
get
to
certain
aspects
of
the
facts
as
they
evolved
in
this
mara
case.
the
government
has
just
conceded
the
point
that
this
was
not
a
special
grand
jury
that
mara
was
called
before,
it
was
just
an
ordinary
grand
jury.
he
appeared
in
the
us
attorney’s
office
in
chicago
on
two
separate
occasions.
he
was
asked
for
his
handwriting
exemplars
not
by
the
grand
jury
or
the
foreman
to
the
grand
jury,
but
by
the
us
attorney.
he
was
asked
to
return
to
the
grand
jury.
he
was
asked
again
by
the
us
attorney,
the
assistant
in
the
grand
jury
room
to
supply
these
handwriting
exemplars.
and
upon
his
refusal
to
do
so
on
constitutional
grounds,
the
us
attorney
directed
the
foreman
of
the
grand
jury
to
direct
the
witness
to
supply
the
handwriting
exemplars
and
that's
how
that
it
came
--
there
came
about
the
petition,
then
before
the
district
courts
at
(inaudible)
in
our
district
and
the
order,
the
petition
which
is
set
forth
in
the
appendix
asked
for
the
giving
of
these
handwriting
exemplars.
to
this
day,
we
do
not
know
what
is
in
that
affidavit
which
was
submitted
in
camera
to
judge
robson.
the
first
that
the
witness
or
his
counsel
knew
of
what
--
some
semblance
of
what
was
in
that
affidavit
is
what
was
set
forth
in
the
circuit
court
of
appeals'
opinion
wherein
they
stated
that
the
contents
of
affidavit
were
solely
the
work
product
of
an
fbi
agent,
the
sole
product
of
an
fbi
agent,
and
that
it
was
investigation
which
occurred
outside
the
scope
of
a
grand
jury.
mara
was
not
afforded
an
opportunity
of
counsel.
no
kind
of
procedure
was
afforded
him
outside
the
grand
jury
room
wherein
and
whereby
he
would
give
exemplars
to
a
fbi
agent.
we
do
not
know
whether
or
not
the
fbi
agent
was
the
duly
designated
authorized
agent
of
a
grand
jury
and
in
that
posture,
that
is
how
that
case
came
before
the
us
court
of
appeals,
and
it
is
now
presently
before
this
court.
we
do
not,
that
is
mara,
we
do
not
concede
that
the
exemplars
sought
by
the
government
are
non-testimonial
or
non-communicative
because
we
just
do
not
know.
we
have
no
ideas,
i've
stated
this
to
what
in
these
affidavits.
it
well
might
be
that
what
this
grand
jury
or
precisely
what
the
government
wanted
was
a
matter
which
was
essentially
germane
to
the
government’s
case
and
to
prove
a
case
against
mara
because
as
they
stated
in
their
petition
for
order,
he
was
a
potential
defendant
in
an
investigation
with
reference
to
the
statutes
involved.
mr.
angelo
ruggiero
i
don’t
know.
i
don’t
know
mr.
chief
justice.
i
just
don’t
know.
i
operate
here
as
i
stand
before
this
court
in
the
vacuum.
this
is
an
affidavit
and
i've
repeated
for
the
third
time
and
that’s
been
the
issue
before
the
--
mr.
angelo
ruggiero
--
district
court.
mr.
angelo
ruggiero
my
position
would
be
that
if
what
he
is
asked
to
write
down
is
germane
or
essential
to
the
government’s
case
to
prove
its
case,
then
i
would
--
my
position
would
be
the
same,
yes.
mr.
angelo
ruggiero
yes,
i
do
your
honor.
firstly,
it’s
a
two-prong
argument
there.
firstly,
we
don’t
know
if
it's
not
--
first
of
all
we
don't
know
if
it's
testimonial
or
communicative;
and
secondly,
even
if
it
were,
it
would
apply
–
if
it's
selectively
germane
to
the
government’s
case,
whereas
they
need
that
to
make
their
case.
mr.
angelo
ruggiero
that’s
--
this
is
exactly
what
we
are
talking
about
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
this
is
exactly
what
i
am
talking
about,
the
fifth
amendment.
mr.
angelo
ruggiero
that
is
correct.
we
didn’t
get
that
far.
he
was
--
we
were
asked
to
give
it
--
he
was
asked
to
give
an
exemplar.
in
my
recollection,
we
were
never
told
what
it
was
and
on
that
basis
upon
refusal
on
the
grounds
as
is
mention
in
our
briefs,
the
fourth,
the
fifth,
we
even
raise
the
sixth
amendment
and
the
abuse
of
the
grand
jury
as
we
did
here.
on
that
basis,
we
went
before
the
lower
--
the
government
went
before
the
lower
district
court
and
an
answer
to
the
government’s
argument
is
before
judge
robson.
we
never
got
an
opportunity
to
argue
other
than
the
fourth
amendment
problem,
that
is
that
affidavit
because
judge
robson
and
its
in
the
appendix
in
the
colloquy
between
myself
and
judge
robson
stated
that
it
was
his
opinion
that
the
constitutional
ground
is
raised
and
because
of
that
affidavit
that
he
had
to
give,
that
is
mara
had
to
give
the
exemplars.
we
never
got
beyond
that
point
and
it
is
about
a
10-page
paragraph
in
the
appendix.
so
we
never
got
into
the
other
issues
as
to
the
fifth,
the
sixth
and
the
abuse
of
the
grand
jury.
it
was
his
opinion
and
that
was
it.
we
do
not
as
i
stated,
concede
that
these
are
non-testimonial
and
non-communicative
exemplars
because
we
do
not
know.
we
also
do
not
concede
that
gilbert
--
i
don’t
believe
that
gilbert
or
wade
state
that
handwriting
exemplars
do
not
fall
within
the
preview
of
the
fifth
amendment
because
gilbert
did
not
raise
the
content
of
the
exemplar.
gilbert
only
said
that
exemplars,
handwriting
exemplars
are
not
within
the
preview
of
fifth
amendment.
we
do
raise
that
question
here
before
this
court.
we
raise
the
content.
we
raise
the
testimonial
and
communicative
nature
of
the
exemplars
before
this
court
because
if
it
is
selectively
germane
to
proving
the
government
case
then
the
fifth
amendment
would
apply.
and
this,
of
course,
would
dovetail
into
the
fourth
amendment
as
it
applies
here
because
of
the
affidavit
would
which
was
submitted
in
camera.
mr.
angelo
ruggiero
i
would
agree,
your
honor,
that’s
true
and
that’s
what
he
should
do,
but
he
was
asked
for
exemplars
and
as
i
stated,
i
don’t
--
we
don’t
know
what
he
was
ask
to
give.
he
was
ask
to
give
certain
exemplars.
he
refused
to
do
so
based
upon
as
i
stated
his
constitutional
rights.
mr.
angelo
ruggiero
if
it
is
something
which
again
is
selectively
germane,
it
is
essential
to
the
government’s
proof
in
a
case
then
i
say
that
the
fifth
amendment
would
apply
because
--
mr.
angelo
ruggiero
we
--
well,
i
don’t
know.
we
don’t
know.
mr.
angelo
ruggiero
that
is
the
case
that
is
before
this
court
now.
mr.
angelo
ruggiero
it
is
not
irrelevant
mr.
chief
justice,
if
in
the
posture
the
question
that
is
put
forth,
if
he
is
asked
certain
questions
about,
for
instance,
this
case
whether
or
not
it
is
a
hijack
case
or
a
conspiracy
case
and
certain
questions
along
that
line,
in
the
posture
of
the
case
and
the
questions
that
maybe
asked
may
show
that
what
they
are
asking
for
is
that
selectively
germane
thing
that
they
want,
the
essential
to
prove
their
case.
mr.
angelo
ruggiero
sure.
mr.
angelo
ruggiero
if
they
are
used
to
prove
a
forgery
or
perhaps
in
this
case
to
prove
a
receipt,
the
signing
of
the
receipt
for
the
--
mr.
angelo
ruggiero
no,
it
is
not.
not
this
particular
case.
mr.
angelo
ruggiero
no,
no.
not
this
case
your
honor.
this
case
has
to
do
with
as
interstate
shipping,
as
it's
commonly
known
as
hijack.
mr.
angelo
ruggiero
that’s
--
mr.
angelo
ruggiero
that’s
the
issue.
if
they
need
his
signature
or
whatever
it
is
that
they
are
seeking
to
state
that
he
is
the
individual
that
signed
this
invoice
or
this
check
or
this
receipt
then
i
think
that
is
what
i
would
call
selectively
germane
to
prove
their
case.
i
mean,
i
don’t
think
there's
any
doubt
that
if
they
came
to
mara
and
asked
him,
“did
you
sign
this
receipt,
that
he
could
assert
his
privilege
under
the
fifth
amendment.
i
don’t
think
there
is
any
question
about
that.
mr.
angelo
ruggiero
that’s
another
question
and
which
is
something
incidentally
that
the
court
of
appeals
suggested
that
they
do
do,
is
to
go
and
get
their
investigation
and
what
seems
to
be,
what
they
did
in
their
affidavit.
mr.
angelo
ruggiero
they
could
do
that.
i
would
say
that
they
could
do
that.
mr.
angelo
ruggiero
but
there's
a
question
mr.
chief
justice
between
asking
a
man
to
come
in
the
grand
jury
room
or
the
us
attorney
and
asking
him
to
write
his
name
and
go
into
a
bank
and
getting
his
signature
from
a
bank.
mr.
angelo
ruggiero
yes,
it
is.
to
me
it
is
and
if
it
all
--
as
i
said,
comes
down
to
the
fourth
amendment
question
in
my
argument
is
to
the
probable
cause
because
of
the
affidavit.
and
the
government
seems
to
take
the
tag
that
that
there
should
be
at
least
as
to
a
showing,
as
to
a
hearing
ex-parte
as
there
would
be
in
search
warrant.
but
i
know
of
no
case
or
an
arrest
warrant,
i
know
of
no
case
that
has
been
cited
to
me
or
that
i've
read
or
anybody
has
called
to
my
attention,
where
an
individual
in
a
search
or
an
arrest
warrant
cannot
see
that
affidavit
in
an
effort
to
suppress
or
to
quash
it,
i
know
of
no
case.
in
this
particular
instance,
we
have
never
been
allowed
to
see
that
affidavit.
we
just
--
we’re
here
in
limbo.
we
don’t
know,
what's
involved.
if
that
is
the
government’s
position,
i
should
think
that
we
would
be
entitled
to
look
at
that
affidavit
to
see
if
there
is
anything
in
it
which
would
be
akin
to
probable
cause.
mr.
angelo
ruggiero
no.
mr.
angelo
ruggiero
no,
your
honor,
no.
mr.
angelo
ruggiero
the
difference
is
that
the
witnesses
have
appeared
before
that
court,
excuse
me,
before
the
grand
jury.
they
haven't
here.
no
such
thing
occurred
here.
nobody
appeared
before
--
mr.
angelo
ruggiero
the
difference
is
because
it's
based
upon
an
affidavit
submitted
by
an
fbi
agent
and
we
have
rules
of
procedure
in
cases
from
this
court,
would
set
forth
the
procedure
within
the
limits
of
a
fourth
amendment.
that
says
that
either
in
searches
and
seizures,
no
unreasonable
searches
and
seizures
and
no
probable
cause,
there
has
to
be
probable
cause.
no
search
warrants
without
probable
cause,
that’s
the
difference.
mr.
angelo
ruggiero
that’s
true,
that
is
true.
the
question
is
to
the
unreasonableness,
i
would
leave
to
my
colleague
on
my
left,
as
to
the
unreasonable
in
the
fourth
amendment
questions.
the
issue
with
the
grand
jury
here
and
the
abuse
of
the
grand
jury
is
one
i
think
that
in
the
times
today
calls
for
an
important
expression
by
this
court.
you
have
here
--
you
had
in
the
situation,
in
the
mara
situation,
a
united
states
attorney
who
is
directing
what
is
grand
jury
used
to
do.
all
of
the
questions
directed
to
the
mara,
all
of
the
information
sought
from
him
was
asked
for
him
not
by
a
grand
jury
but
by
a
us
attorney.
now
what
in
effect
has
occurred
in
the
mara
case
exactly
is
that
the
grand
jury
has
become
an
arm,
an
investigative
arm
of
the
us
government.
and
i
think
that
in
view
of
the
cases
that
have
come
down
and
i
take
to
heart
the
statement
and
the
speech
given
by
our
chief
judge
campbell,
who
was
then
chief
judge,
he
is
since
retired,
who
gave
a
talk
before
the
federal
judicial
center.
chief
judge
campbell
was
a
judge
in
our
court
for
some
32
years
and
for
many
years,
he
reigned
as
the
chief
judge
and
he
knew
a
little
about
grand
juries
and
their
operations
and
what
occurred
and
it
was
his
opinion
in
that
speech
that
grand
jury
should
be
abolished
because
any
us
attorney
who
deems
it
necessary,
can
indict
anybody
for
any
reason
whatsoever.
and
that
the
grand
jury
does
not
function
today
as
an
arm
to
stand
between
the
accused
and
the
accuser
and
on
that
basis,
it
should
be
abolished
and
i
concur
in
that
expression,
especially
in
view
of
what
has
occurred
in
this
case.
if
this
grand
jury
had
been
investigated
solely
on
its
own
basis,
had
been
directing
questions,
had
been
asking
questions,
was
seeking
information
on
its
own
that
would
be
one
question,
but
it
was
not.
this
grand
jury
was
acting
under
the
authority
of
the
assistant
attorney,
us
attorney,
in
that
courtroom
and
he
was
directing
the
operations
in
that
courtroom.
i
think
that,
it
is
time
that
we
have
some
expression
from
this
court
as
to
what
the
functions,
again
of
a
grand
jury
should
be
relative
to
this
kind
of
situation.
the
preliminary
--
mr.
angelo
ruggiero
i'm
sorry.
i
didn’t
see
the
white
light.
thank
you.
