mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
as
i
mentioned
is
the
follow-up
sequel
to
united
states
against
dionisio.
it's
also
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
seventh
circuit,
and
in
this
case
we
have
a
slightly
different
factual
setting.
this
was
an
investigation
being
pursued
not
by
a
special
grand
jury
but
by
the
regular
september
1971
grand
jury,
and
the
grand
jury
was
investigating
a
theft
from
interstate
shipment
and
a
conspiracy
violation.
mr.
mara
was
subpoenaed
before
the
grand
jury
and
was
directed
by
the
grand
jury
foreman
to
give
exemplars
of
his
hand
writing
and
his
printing.
and
he
returned
--
refuse
on
constitutional
grounds,
essentially
fourth
and
fifth
amendment
grounds.
the
government
then
filed
a
petition
with
the
district
court
to
compel
mr.
mara
to
give
the
handwriting
and
printing
exemplars
and
in
that
petition,
the
government
alleged
the
nature
of
the
grand
jury
investigation
which
is
an
investigation
under
section
659,
theft
from
interstate
shipment
and
371,
conspiracy
and
it
alleged
that
mr.
mara
had
been
asked
for
handwriting
and
printing
exemplars
which
the
grand
jury
considered
essential
and
necessary
solely
for
the
purpose
of
comparing
his
handwriting
to
determine
whether
he
was
the
author
of
certain
writings
that
were
before
the
grand
jury.
the
petition
further
alleged
that
mr.
mara
had
refused
to
obey
the
foreman’s
direction
and
refused
to
give
the
handwriting
and
printing
exemplars.
the
government
also
in
an
attempt
to
comply
with
what
it
understood
to
be
the
requirement
of
united
states
v.
dionisio
which
we
were
nevertheless
challenging
before
this
court,
submitted
in
camera
to
the
district
court
an
affidavit
by
an
fbi
agent
who
had
testified
before
the
grand
jury.
and
in
that
affidavit
as
the
petition
alleged,
the
court
would
determine
that
if
there
were
reasonable
grounds,
that
reasonableness
must
be
determined
for
the
grand
jury’s
demand
for
the
handwriting
exemplars.
the
--
that
affidavit
was
before
the
district
court
at
the
hearing
on
the
government’s
petition.
the
respondent
objected
to
the
petition
for
the
exemplar
order
raising
essentially
two
grounds.
first,
the
contention
was
that
the
government
did
not
have
probable
cause
to
support
the
application,
the
argument
being
that
since
the
grand
jury
had
not
indicted
him,
it
clearly
did
not
yet
have
probable
cause
to
think
that
he
was
somehow
linked
with
the
crime.
and
secondly,
the
objection
was
made
that
the
government
was
trying
to
support
the
petition
by
showing
of
reasonableness
by
submitting
an
affidavit
that
was
not
being
made
available.
the
district
judge
ruled
that
an
in
camera
submission
was
sufficient
and
also
ruled
that
probable
cause
was
not
the
standard
necessary
even
under
the
dionisio
to
secure
an
exemplar
order.
the
respondent,
mr.
mara,
was
then
ordered
to
provide
such
samples
of
his
handwriting,
his
printing
as
the
grand
jury
might
deem
necessary
and
in
this
case
mr.
justice
marshall
the
order
explicitly
did
not
make
any
reference
i
believe
to
the
--
to
any
agents
of
the
grand
jury,
it
said
to
provide
exemplars
before
and
to
the
grand
jury.
there's
been
no
objection
–
there
was
no
objection
at
the
hearing
either
before
the
grand
jury
or
at
the
original
hearing
on
that
ground.
after
the
district
court
entered
its
order,
requiring
the
giving
of
the
exemplars
and
mr.
mara
refused
in
open
court
to
give
the
exemplars
and
was
committed
for
contempt,
mr.
mara,
through
his
counsel
submitted
an
application
for
a
stay
or
for
bond,
and
in
that
application
as
he
has
since
then,
has
urged
the
contention
that
it
was
improper
to
suggest
or
to
direct
that
the
handwriting
exemplars
be
given
to
a
sworn
agent
of
the
grand
jury.
the
argument
is
made,
this
goes
beyond
the
lawful
province
of
the
grand
jury.
i
had
to
anticipate,
i
say
that
the
government
position
on
this
is
the
same
as
it
was
in
the
prior
case
that
the
refusal
before
the
grand
jury
was
a
categorical
one
based
on
constitutional
grounds
not
based
on
the
local
of
the
giving
of
the
exemplars.
and
both
the
petition
and
the
order
call
only
for
the
giving
of
exemplars
before
the
grand
jury,
if
respondent
is
willing
to
comply
with
that.
after
the
district
court
denied
bail
or
stay,
the
court
of
appeals
did
release
mr.
mara
on
bond
and
when
the
case
was
argued,
the
court
of
appeals
also
asked
that
the
fbi
agent's
affidavit
be
submitted
to
it
in
camera
and
that
was
subsequently
done.
the
affidavit
is
now
before
this
court
as
a
sealed
exhibit,
it
is
never
been
seen
to
the
best
of
my
knowledge
by
respondent.
the
seventh
circuit
reaffirmed
its
holding
in
dionisio
that
the
fourth
amendment
requires
that
the
government
on
behalf
of
the
grand
jury
must
make
an
affirmative
showing
of
reasonableness
before
it
can
obtain
an
exemplar
like
this
from
a
witness.
the
court
rejected
fifth
and
sixth
amendment
privilege
and
counsel
claims
for
essentially
the
same
reasons
that
it
had
in
dionisio,
but
it
held
here
that
it
would
address
itself
to
the
procedures
that
the
government
had
to
avail
itself
in
order
to
show
reasonableness
and
would
also
discuss
the
substantive
content
of
that
reasonableness
showing.
on
both
points,
the
seventh
circuit
held
that
the
government
on
behalf
of
the
grand
jury
had
been
deficient.
on
the
question
of
the
proper
procedure,
the
seventh
circuit
ruled
that
in
order
to
demonstrate
reasonableness,
the
government
must
submit
its
affidavit
or
any
other
proof
it
wants
to
bring
to
the
attention
of
the
district
court
in
an
open
and
adversary
hearing.
so
the
court
of
appeals
said,
the
respondent
can
have
an
opportunity
to
litigate
the
sufficiency
of
the
government
showing.
the
court
ruled
that
grand
jury's
secrecy
is
not
a
magical
incantation
and
was
not
applicable
in
this
kind
of
setting.
on
the
question
of
the
substantive
showing,
the
content
of
the
reasonableness
determination,
the
court
imposed
a
number
of
factual
requirements
that
must
be
affirmatively
demonstrated
by
the
government.
these
are
set
forth
of
course
in
the
court’s
opinion
which
is
printed
as
an
appendix
to
the
cert
petition.
the
court
of
appeals
stated
at
the
outset
that
the
government
must
show
that
what
is
being
conducted
is
a
lawful,
properly
authorized
grand
jury
investigation.
that
the
investigation
is
probing
some
objective
that
congress
can
permissibly
authorize.
it
must
also
show
that
what
is
being
sought
is
relevant
to
the
inquiry.
that’s
exactly
the
kind
of
preliminary
showing
of
this
court
in
branzburg,
not
to
mention
many
other
cases
that
are
cited
in
the
various
briefs
has
refused
to
require
grand
jury
to
show
before
it
could
conduct
its
inquiry.
in
addition
to
what
it
termed
the
showing
of
relevance
to
the
inquiry,
the
seventh
circuit
insisted
that
the
government
must
show
that
the
grand
jury
process
is
not
being
abused,
and
that
the
exemplars
being
sought
are
adequate,
but
not
excessive
to
its
purpose.
now
that
rather
ambiguous
formulation
was
amplified
by
the
seventh
circuit
which
went
on
to
say
that
this
meant
that
the
government
had
to
show
exactly
with
more
specific
detail
on
the
fbi
agent's
affidavit
before
it
had
shown,
what
the
purpose
of
the
identification
evidence
was,
what
its
connection
was
with
the
crime
being
investigated,
what
the
witness's
connection
is
between
the
identification,
evidence
and
the
crime
might
be.
the
government
also
has
to
show
according
to
the
seventh
circuit
in
order
to
obtain
the
exemplar
that
the
evidence,
the
identification
evidence
is
not
otherwise
available,
again,
another
test
that
the
court
explicitly
rejected
in
branzburg
in
the
first
amendment
context
and
the
court
said
that
it
would
regard
the
grand
jury
process
as
being
abused,
if
the
government
failed
to
show
that
it
was
unable
to
obtain
this
material
in
any
other
way
because
the
court
said,
“having
a
grand
jury
obtain
evidence
that
investigators
might
otherwise
be
able
to
come
upon
is
an
abusive
process.”
we
think
that
is
also
an
unsupportable
position,
but
in
any
event,
the
court
found
that
the
showing
of
the
government
had
made
in
the
affidavit
submitted
in
camera
did
not
rise
to
the
level
of
showing
these
stringent
standard
--
meeting
the
stringent
standards
of
relevancy
non-abusive
grand
jury
process,
and
direct
link
between
the
witness
whose
identification,
whose
evidence
was
being
sought
and
the
other
materials
before
the
grand
jury.
the
government
promptly
filed
a
petition
to
review
that
decision
and
in
the
interim,
judge
friendly
had
a
virtually
identical
case
before
him
in
the
second
circuit,
a
case
of
united
states
against
doe,
mr.
schwartz,
the
real
party
in
interest
and
in
that
decision,
judge
friendly
taking
specific
note
of
both
dionisio
and
mara,
ruled
that
reasonableness
was
not
the
standard
that
had
to
be
met
as
an
affirmative
matter
in
obtaining
this
kind
of
exemplar,
handwriting
exemplar
and
that
in
any
event,
if
there
is
to
be
some
sort
of
preliminary
showing
of
reasonableness,
the
test
certainly
can’t
be
as
burdensome
and
as
intense
as
the
seventh
circuit
has
suggested.
the
bedrock
position
that
we
take
in
this
case
of
course
is
identical
to
the
one
in
dionisio
and
that
is
that
the
grand
jury
witness
is
lawfully
before
the
grand
jury.
apart
from
a
fifth
amendment
privilege
against
self
incrimination,
the
witness
has
the
obligation
that
every
other
citizens
has
to
appear
and
to
give
testimony
to
cooperate
in
the
grand
jury's
investigation
even
if
that
means
giving
some
physical,
some
non-communicative
or
non-testimonial
evidence
that
maybe
involved
in
the
grand
jury's
investigation
of
him.
we
think
it's
settled
that
the
fifth
amendment
does
not
apply
to
this
kind
of
inquiry
as
even
the
seventh
circuit
has
held.
we
also
believe
that
like
a
voice
exemplar,
handwriting
is
the
kind
of
identifying
physical
characteristic
that
one
does
not
have
a
reasonable
expectation
about.
his
handwriting
is
customarily
made
available
in
all
sorts
of
casual
contacts
and
that
the
grand
jury
is
not
usurping
any
untoward
power,
is
not
impinging
upon
any
privacy
when
it
asks
the
witness
to
provide
it
with
a
sample
of
his
handwriting.
now,
there's
some
argument
in
this
case
as
in
the
other
that
giving
of
exemplar
evidence
is
somehow
different
for
fourth
amendment
purposes
from
the
giving
of
oral
testimony
which
we
all
concede
is
not
covered
by
the
fourth
amendment
because
giving
of
exemplar
evidence
involves
an
act
of
the
will.
it
involves
an
affirmative,
physical
act
to
create
in
the
words
of
the
legal
aid
agency's
brief,
to
create
the
evidence
that
is
being
sought.
well
in
a
sense,
there
is
a
creative
process
that
is
at
work
here.
the
witness
is
being
asked
for
a
voice
exemplar
or
for
a
handwriting
exemplar
must
as
a
matter
of
intellect
and
will,
decide
that
he
will
cooperate.
he
must
order
his
muscles,
his
diaphragm,
his
larynx
or
his
hands
in
this
kind
of
case,
to
manifest
the
evidence.
but
we
cannot
see
that
there
is
any
constitutional
difference
between
that
kind
of
voluntary
action,
that
kind
of
cooperation,
and
the
kind
of
voluntary
action
or
cooperation
that
an
ordinary
grand
jury
witness
is
being
asked
for
oral
testimony,
he
must
furnish.
he
too
when
asked
what
do
you
know
about
the
accident
that
occurred
on
43rd
street
or
when
asked,
what
you
know
about
gambling
in
kell,
illinois,
must
go
through
the
same
cognitive
process,
deciding
whether
he
will
voluntarily
formulate
a
response,
whether
he
will
order
his
body
to
provide
the
evidence
that
will
intelligible
to
the
grand
jury
itself.
he
has
to
create
the
evidence
that
it
has
to
be
laid
before
the
grand
jury.
we
think
that
for
fourth
amendment
purposes
no
more
--
no
less
than
for
fifth
amendment
purposes,
there
is
no
relevant
constitutional
distinction
between
the
giving
of
oral
testimony
that
is
unprivileged
and
the
giving
of
physical
exemplar
evidence
that
is
not
itself
subject
to
an
expectation
of
privacy
and
that
we
submit
is
this
case.
now,
moving
along
to
the
standards
and
as
mr.
justice
stewart
asked
in
the
earlier
case,
if
the
court
agrees
with
the
second
circuit
and
disagrees
with
the
seventh
in
the
dionisio
decision,
and
holds
that
there
is
no
burden
on
the
grand
jury
to
show
reasonableness
before
it
can
expect
compliance
with
its
orders
than
the
two
issues
that
are
before
the
court
in
this
case
become
academic.
that
is
the
procedure
to
be
followed
in
showing
reasonableness
and
the
content
of
the
reasonableness
showing.
but
assuming
the
court,
decides
that
there
is
some
obligation
of
this
sort,
we
submit
that
in
this
kind
of
context,
a
current
ongoing
grand
jury
investigation,
the
procedure
that
was
followed
in
this
case
is
quite
sufficient.
that
is
the
submission
of
an
in
camera
affidavit
which
the
district
judge
can
examine
to
determine
whether
it
is
sufficient.
we
think
that
cases
relied
on
by
the
seventh
circuit
are
quite
at
odds
with
the
customary
obligations
of
adversary
litigation,
and
we
also
emphasize
that
we're
talking
here
about
a
grand
jury
proceeding
where
there
is
a
need
for
dispatch,
there
is
a
need
for
secrecy,
there
is
a
need
for
simplifying
the
proceedings,
especially
when
as
we
believe
is
the
case,
there
are
no
major
constitutional
values
implicated.
now,
the
submission
of
an
ex
parte
affidavit
to
the
court
to
make
some
legal
test
of
it,
of
its
sufficiency
is
not
at
all
unusual
in
this
kind
of
setting.
it
is
the
traditional
procedure
with
the
search
warrant
and
it
is
been
thought
necessary
that
the
warrant
can
actually
be
issued.
this
is
what
actually
happens,
the
warrant
is
issued.
whatever
privacy
is
involved
is
already
invaded
pursuant
to
that
warrant
before
there
is
any
opportunity
to
test
its
sufficiency
and
adversary
proceeding.
but
going
beyond
that,
the
cases
relied
on,
like
davis
against
the
united
states,
the
grand
jury
minutes
case
or
alderman,
the
illegal
electronic
surveillance
case,
talked
about
the
necessity
for
an
adversary
hearing
because
the
inquiry
in
that
area
was
one
of
relevance
and
a
relevance
determination
is
one
that
turns
on
a
lot
subtle
factors,
which
cannot
always
be
recognized
by
a
judge
who
isn’t
as
close
to
the
evidence,
to
the
investigation,
to
the
background
as
the
adverse
party.
but
even
in
alderman,
the
court
said
that
they
are
related
kinds
of
inquiries
that
can
be
made,
and
made
decisively
and
finally
ex
parte
by
the
judge.
and
in
fact
in
subsequent
cases
also
reported
in
the
same
volume
of
the
us
reports,
giordano
and
taglianetti,
the
court
explicitly
affirmed
that
district
judges
acting
in
camera
without
an
adversary
hearing
could
decide
such
issues
as
whether
a
person
had
standing
to
complain
about
a
fourth
amendment
violation
and
could
even
decide
ex
parte
without
any
contest
from
an
adverse
litigant,
that
in
particular
electronic
surveillance
was
legal
and
that
determination
would
not
be
subject
to
any
adversarial
litigation.
we
consider
this
kind
of
case
a
fortiori
because
if
a
district
judge
can
make
a
decisive
and
conclusive
determination
that
an
electronic
surveillance
is
lawful
and
can
make
that
without
giving
any
opportunity
to
the
other
side
to
contest
that
determination,
we
think
in
a
much
more
extreme
posture
of
an
ongoing
grand
jury
investigation,
there
is
even
less
justification
for
demanding
that
the
government
showing
of
reasonableness,
if
any
it
must
make,
must
be
subjected
to
full
litigation.
and
in
this
case,
i
might
point
out
what
we
have
is
an
order
by
the
court
of
appeals
that
the
respondent
in
an
exemplar
case
must
be
given
an
opportunity
to
test
the
sufficiency
of
the
government's
showing,
and
i
think
that
clearly
contemplates
a
full
trial-type
or
hearing-type
proceeding.
that
i
think
is
--
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
well,
in
the
taglianetti
case
which
is
in
394
us,
the
court
summarily
affirmed,
granted
cert
and
affirmed
the
judgment
holding
that
the
district
judge
acted
properly
in
determining
who
had
been
overheard
and
who
had
not
even
though
the
defendant
wanted
to
--
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
yes,
sir.
we're
not
contesting
that
holding.
what
we're
saying
is
that
the
kind
of
inquiry
here
is
quite
different
from
the
relevancy
determination
in
alderman,
where
we
concede
that
it's
difficult
for
a
judge
who
is
not
familiar
with
the
activities
of
the
--
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
pardon?
i'm
sorry.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
that’s
the
underlying
rationale
for
alderman
and
indeed
for
dennis.
it's
difficult
to
make
a
relevancy
determination
ex
parte,
we
concede
that.
here,
we’re
talking
about
not
making
a
relevancy
determination,
but
determining
whether
the
grand
jury
has
a
reasonable
basis
for
asking
a
witness
to
provide
an
exemplar.
we
think
that
is
the
kind
of
determination
that
can
be
made
ex
parte
on
the
basis
of
a
submission
by
the
government.
this
is
the
kind
of
determination
that
a
judge
who
is
presented
with
an
application
for
a
search
warrant
customarily
makes,
and
he
even
has
to
make
higher
standard
of
determination
than
in
this
case,
because
the
seventh
circuit
hasn’t
said
the
probable
cause
is
the
standard.
but
we
are
content
in
our
system
to
allow
district
judges
to
make
ex
parte
determinations
of
probable
cause.
and
i
think,
even
though
you
are
correct
that
the
court
hasn’t
completely
ruled
on
all
of
these
electronic
surveillance
issues
in
taglianetti
as
i
say,
the
court
did
affirm
the
ex
parte
procedure
that
was
followed
in
the
determining
who
had
been
overheard
and
who
hadn’t,
and
in
giordano,
which
was
a
master
order
sending
back
for
further
proceedings
in
a
number
of
electronic
surveillance
cases,
mr.
justice
stewart
explicitly
stating
in
his
concurring
opinion
that
the
court
was
in
no
way
intimating
that
ex
parte
proceedings
were
not
satisfactory
to
determine
legality
and
that
in
fact
has
been
the
process
that’s
been
followed
in
lower
courts.
so,
we
think
then
the
rationale
for
the
adversary
hearing
cases
is
inapplicable.
on
the
other
side,
we
have
what
is
a
legitimate
value,
and
that
is
the
value
of
grand
jury
secrecies.
we're
not
talking
now
about
attempts
to
keep
the
minutes
of
grand
jury
proceedings
secret
so
that
they
can't
be
used
to
impeach
a
witness
when
he
testifies
years
afterwards.
we’re
talking
about
a
requirement
that
the
seventh
circuit
has
imposed,
that
the
government
make
an
open
showing
of
the
current
status
of
a
grand
jury
proceeding.
we
think
that
is
probably
the
--
as
a
distant
from
the
legitimate
purposes
of
grand
jury
secrecy
which
are
designed
to
provide
the
grand
jury
an
opportunity
to
pursue
its
investigation
without
providing
any
tip
off
either
to
the
witnesses
or
to
other
people
who
may
not
be
called
before
the
grand
jury
about
the
focus
of
the
grand
jury's
investigation,
its
progress
thus
far,
which
witnesses
may
so
far
have
been
called
before
or
which
witnesses
may
not
had
been?
we
think
that
balancing
those
two
factors,
the
lack
of
any
substantial
need
for
an
adversary
litigation
of
a
showing
of
reasonableness
against
the
very
considerable
interest
of
preserving
the
secrecy
of
an
ongoing
grand
jury
combined
to
render
the
seventh
circuit's
decision
wrong.
the
separate
inquiry
of
course
is
one
of
the
standard
of
reasonableness
of
the
seventh
circuit
in
explaining
what
it
meant
in
dionisio
by
listing
all
of
the
criteria
that
must
be
met
here,
i
think
it
has
gone
far
beyond
with
this
court
has
ever
intimated,
must
be
shown,
certainly
in
any
grand
jury
investigation.
the
court
imposes
a
very
stringent
obligation
of
showing
relevancy
which
is
perhaps
even
more
intense
than
the
similar
suggestion
that
had
been
made
and
rejected
in
branzburg
and
i
think,
it
is
our
position
for
a
much
less
justifiable
constitutional
objective.
furthermore,
the
requirement
that
the
government
--
the
grand
jury
must
show
the
evidence
is
not
otherwise
available.
another
criterion
that
was
rejected
in
branzburg
is
unwarranted,
is
somewhat
unrealistic
because
at
the
one
end,
if
the
witness
himself
is
agreeable
to
providing
a
grand
jury
--
providing
a
handwriting
exemplar,
we
don’t
have
the
litigation
that
we're
confronted
with
today
where
the
witness
refuses
on
constitutional
grounds
to
cooperate.
on
the
hand,
it's
not
difficult
to
see
that
using
other
investigative
channels
to
secure
handwriting
exemplars
maybe
even
more
intrusive
on
fourth
amendment
interests,
then
is
issuing
court
process,
asking
a
person
to
come
to
the
united
states
courthouse
where
in
secrecy
he
can
provide
an
exemplar.
it
would
be
possible
presumably
for
fbi
agents
to
go
to
a
person’s
bank,
or
to
a
credit
agency,
or
to
his
employer,
and
ask
whether
they
will
supply
exemplars
of
the
--
would
be
witness'
handwriting.
i
don’t
think
that
the
court
should
regard
the
lack
of
use
of
those
alternatives
as
something
the
government
must
affirmatively
apologize
for,
before
it
asks
a
grand
jury
witness
to
provide
exemplars.
the
level
of
the
showing
that
the
seventh
circuit
has
imposed
in
this
decision,
i
think
can
best
be
illustrated
by
a
reading
of
the
government’s
petition
before
the
district
court
which
set
out
specifically
the
offense
that
was
being
investigated
by
the
grand
jury,
which
set
out
specifically
that
the
grand
jury
thought
it
necessary
for
this
witness
to
provide
handwriting
and
printing
exemplars
so
that
the
grand
jury
could
determine
whether
he
was
the
author
of
particular
writings
already
before
the
grand
jury.
in
that
context,
i
think,
if
that
showing
does
not
meet
whatever
reasonableness
showing
the
constitution
may
call
for,
of
course,
we
argue
that
it
calls
for
none,
the
standard
must
be
something
quite
close
to
probable
cause
which
is
an
anomalous
requirement
since
probable
cause
is
the
end
of
the
grand
jury's
inquiry
not
its
beginning.
for
that
reason,
we
request
that
the
judgment
seventh
circuit
be
reversed.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
unless
the
court
has
any
further
questions,
the
government
will
waive
rebuttal.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
as
i
mentioned
is
the
follow-up
sequel
to
united
states
against
dionisio.
it's
also
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
seventh
circuit,
and
in
this
case
we
have
a
slightly
different
factual
setting.
this
was
an
investigation
being
pursued
not
by
a
special
grand
jury
but
by
the
regular
september
1971
grand
jury,
and
the
grand
jury
was
investigating
a
theft
from
interstate
shipment
and
a
conspiracy
violation.
mr.
mara
was
subpoenaed
before
the
grand
jury
and
was
directed
by
the
grand
jury
foreman
to
give
exemplars
of
his
hand
writing
and
his
printing.
and
he
returned
--
refuse
on
constitutional
grounds,
essentially
fourth
and
fifth
amendment
grounds.
the
government
then
filed
a
petition
with
the
district
court
to
compel
mr.
mara
to
give
the
handwriting
and
printing
exemplars
and
in
that
petition,
the
government
alleged
the
nature
of
the
grand
jury
investigation
which
is
an
investigation
under
section
659,
theft
from
interstate
shipment
and
371,
conspiracy
and
it
alleged
that
mr.
mara
had
been
asked
for
handwriting
and
printing
exemplars
which
the
grand
jury
considered
essential
and
necessary
solely
for
the
purpose
of
comparing
his
handwriting
to
determine
whether
he
was
the
author
of
certain
writings
that
were
before
the
grand
jury.
the
petition
further
alleged
that
mr.
mara
had
refused
to
obey
the
foreman’s
direction
and
refused
to
give
the
handwriting
and
printing
exemplars.
the
government
also
in
an
attempt
to
comply
with
what
it
understood
to
be
the
requirement
of
united
states
v.
dionisio
which
we
were
nevertheless
challenging
before
this
court,
submitted
in
camera
to
the
district
court
an
affidavit
by
an
fbi
agent
who
had
testified
before
the
grand
jury.
and
in
that
affidavit
as
the
petition
alleged,
the
court
would
determine
that
if
there
were
reasonable
grounds,
that
reasonableness
must
be
determined
for
the
grand
jury’s
demand
for
the
handwriting
exemplars.
the
--
that
affidavit
was
before
the
district
court
at
the
hearing
on
the
government’s
petition.
the
respondent
objected
to
the
petition
for
the
exemplar
order
raising
essentially
two
grounds.
first,
the
contention
was
that
the
government
did
not
have
probable
cause
to
support
the
application,
the
argument
being
that
since
the
grand
jury
had
not
indicted
him,
it
clearly
did
not
yet
have
probable
cause
to
think
that
he
was
somehow
linked
with
the
crime.
and
secondly,
the
objection
was
made
that
the
government
was
trying
to
support
the
petition
by
showing
of
reasonableness
by
submitting
an
affidavit
that
was
not
being
made
available.
the
district
judge
ruled
that
an
in
camera
submission
was
sufficient
and
also
ruled
that
probable
cause
was
not
the
standard
necessary
even
under
the
dionisio
to
secure
an
exemplar
order.
the
respondent,
mr.
mara,
was
then
ordered
to
provide
such
samples
of
his
handwriting,
his
printing
as
the
grand
jury
might
deem
necessary
and
in
this
case
mr.
justice
marshall
the
order
explicitly
did
not
make
any
reference
i
believe
to
the
--
to
any
agents
of
the
grand
jury,
it
said
to
provide
exemplars
before
and
to
the
grand
jury.
there's
been
no
objection
–
there
was
no
objection
at
the
hearing
either
before
the
grand
jury
or
at
the
original
hearing
on
that
ground.
after
the
district
court
entered
its
order,
requiring
the
giving
of
the
exemplars
and
mr.
mara
refused
in
open
court
to
give
the
exemplars
and
was
committed
for
contempt,
mr.
mara,
through
his
counsel
submitted
an
application
for
a
stay
or
for
bond,
and
in
that
application
as
he
has
since
then,
has
urged
the
contention
that
it
was
improper
to
suggest
or
to
direct
that
the
handwriting
exemplars
be
given
to
a
sworn
agent
of
the
grand
jury.
the
argument
is
made,
this
goes
beyond
the
lawful
province
of
the
grand
jury.
i
had
to
anticipate,
i
say
that
the
government
position
on
this
is
the
same
as
it
was
in
the
prior
case
that
the
refusal
before
the
grand
jury
was
a
categorical
one
based
on
constitutional
grounds
not
based
on
the
local
of
the
giving
of
the
exemplars.
and
both
the
petition
and
the
order
call
only
for
the
giving
of
exemplars
before
the
grand
jury,
if
respondent
is
willing
to
comply
with
that.
after
the
district
court
denied
bail
or
stay,
the
court
of
appeals
did
release
mr.
mara
on
bond
and
when
the
case
was
argued,
the
court
of
appeals
also
asked
that
the
fbi
agent's
affidavit
be
submitted
to
it
in
camera
and
that
was
subsequently
done.
the
affidavit
is
now
before
this
court
as
a
sealed
exhibit,
it
is
never
been
seen
to
the
best
of
my
knowledge
by
respondent.
the
seventh
circuit
reaffirmed
its
holding
in
dionisio
that
the
fourth
amendment
requires
that
the
government
on
behalf
of
the
grand
jury
must
make
an
affirmative
showing
of
reasonableness
before
it
can
obtain
an
exemplar
like
this
from
a
witness.
the
court
rejected
fifth
and
sixth
amendment
privilege
and
counsel
claims
for
essentially
the
same
reasons
that
it
had
in
dionisio,
but
it
held
here
that
it
would
address
itself
to
the
procedures
that
the
government
had
to
avail
itself
in
order
to
show
reasonableness
and
would
also
discuss
the
substantive
content
of
that
reasonableness
showing.
on
both
points,
the
seventh
circuit
held
that
the
government
on
behalf
of
the
grand
jury
had
been
deficient.
on
the
question
of
the
proper
procedure,
the
seventh
circuit
ruled
that
in
order
to
demonstrate
reasonableness,
the
government
must
submit
its
affidavit
or
any
other
proof
it
wants
to
bring
to
the
attention
of
the
district
court
in
an
open
and
adversary
hearing.
so
the
court
of
appeals
said,
the
respondent
can
have
an
opportunity
to
litigate
the
sufficiency
of
the
government
showing.
the
court
ruled
that
grand
jury's
secrecy
is
not
a
magical
incantation
and
was
not
applicable
in
this
kind
of
setting.
on
the
question
of
the
substantive
showing,
the
content
of
the
reasonableness
determination,
the
court
imposed
a
number
of
factual
requirements
that
must
be
affirmatively
demonstrated
by
the
government.
these
are
set
forth
of
course
in
the
court’s
opinion
which
is
printed
as
an
appendix
to
the
cert
petition.
the
court
of
appeals
stated
at
the
outset
that
the
government
must
show
that
what
is
being
conducted
is
a
lawful,
properly
authorized
grand
jury
investigation.
that
the
investigation
is
probing
some
objective
that
congress
can
permissibly
authorize.
it
must
also
show
that
what
is
being
sought
is
relevant
to
the
inquiry.
that’s
exactly
the
kind
of
preliminary
showing
of
this
court
in
branzburg,
not
to
mention
many
other
cases
that
are
cited
in
the
various
briefs
has
refused
to
require
grand
jury
to
show
before
it
could
conduct
its
inquiry.
in
addition
to
what
it
termed
the
showing
of
relevance
to
the
inquiry,
the
seventh
circuit
insisted
that
the
government
must
show
that
the
grand
jury
process
is
not
being
abused,
and
that
the
exemplars
being
sought
are
adequate,
but
not
excessive
to
its
purpose.
now
that
rather
ambiguous
formulation
was
amplified
by
the
seventh
circuit
which
went
on
to
say
that
this
meant
that
the
government
had
to
show
exactly
with
more
specific
detail
on
the
fbi
agent's
affidavit
before
it
had
shown,
what
the
purpose
of
the
identification
evidence
was,
what
its
connection
was
with
the
crime
being
investigated,
what
the
witness's
connection
is
between
the
identification,
evidence
and
the
crime
might
be.
the
government
also
has
to
show
according
to
the
seventh
circuit
in
order
to
obtain
the
exemplar
that
the
evidence,
the
identification
evidence
is
not
otherwise
available,
again,
another
test
that
the
court
explicitly
rejected
in
branzburg
in
the
first
amendment
context
and
the
court
said
that
it
would
regard
the
grand
jury
process
as
being
abused,
if
the
government
failed
to
show
that
it
was
unable
to
obtain
this
material
in
any
other
way
because
the
court
said,
“having
a
grand
jury
obtain
evidence
that
investigators
might
otherwise
be
able
to
come
upon
is
an
abusive
process.”
we
think
that
is
also
an
unsupportable
position,
but
in
any
event,
the
court
found
that
the
showing
of
the
government
had
made
in
the
affidavit
submitted
in
camera
did
not
rise
to
the
level
of
showing
these
stringent
standard
--
meeting
the
stringent
standards
of
relevancy
non-abusive
grand
jury
process,
and
direct
link
between
the
witness
whose
identification,
whose
evidence
was
being
sought
and
the
other
materials
before
the
grand
jury.
the
government
promptly
filed
a
petition
to
review
that
decision
and
in
the
interim,
judge
friendly
had
a
virtually
identical
case
before
him
in
the
second
circuit,
a
case
of
united
states
against
doe,
mr.
schwartz,
the
real
party
in
interest
and
in
that
decision,
judge
friendly
taking
specific
note
of
both
dionisio
and
mara,
ruled
that
reasonableness
was
not
the
standard
that
had
to
be
met
as
an
affirmative
matter
in
obtaining
this
kind
of
exemplar,
handwriting
exemplar
and
that
in
any
event,
if
there
is
to
be
some
sort
of
preliminary
showing
of
reasonableness,
the
test
certainly
can’t
be
as
burdensome
and
as
intense
as
the
seventh
circuit
has
suggested.
the
bedrock
position
that
we
take
in
this
case
of
course
is
identical
to
the
one
in
dionisio
and
that
is
that
the
grand
jury
witness
is
lawfully
before
the
grand
jury.
apart
from
a
fifth
amendment
privilege
against
self
incrimination,
the
witness
has
the
obligation
that
every
other
citizens
has
to
appear
and
to
give
testimony
to
cooperate
in
the
grand
jury's
investigation
even
if
that
means
giving
some
physical,
some
non-communicative
or
non-testimonial
evidence
that
maybe
involved
in
the
grand
jury's
investigation
of
him.
we
think
it's
settled
that
the
fifth
amendment
does
not
apply
to
this
kind
of
inquiry
as
even
the
seventh
circuit
has
held.
we
also
believe
that
like
a
voice
exemplar,
handwriting
is
the
kind
of
identifying
physical
characteristic
that
one
does
not
have
a
reasonable
expectation
about.
his
handwriting
is
customarily
made
available
in
all
sorts
of
casual
contacts
and
that
the
grand
jury
is
not
usurping
any
untoward
power,
is
not
impinging
upon
any
privacy
when
it
asks
the
witness
to
provide
it
with
a
sample
of
his
handwriting.
now,
there's
some
argument
in
this
case
as
in
the
other
that
giving
of
exemplar
evidence
is
somehow
different
for
fourth
amendment
purposes
from
the
giving
of
oral
testimony
which
we
all
concede
is
not
covered
by
the
fourth
amendment
because
giving
of
exemplar
evidence
involves
an
act
of
the
will.
it
involves
an
affirmative,
physical
act
to
create
in
the
words
of
the
legal
aid
agency's
brief,
to
create
the
evidence
that
is
being
sought.
well
in
a
sense,
there
is
a
creative
process
that
is
at
work
here.
the
witness
is
being
asked
for
a
voice
exemplar
or
for
a
handwriting
exemplar
must
as
a
matter
of
intellect
and
will,
decide
that
he
will
cooperate.
he
must
order
his
muscles,
his
diaphragm,
his
larynx
or
his
hands
in
this
kind
of
case,
to
manifest
the
evidence.
but
we
cannot
see
that
there
is
any
constitutional
difference
between
that
kind
of
voluntary
action,
that
kind
of
cooperation,
and
the
kind
of
voluntary
action
or
cooperation
that
an
ordinary
grand
jury
witness
is
being
asked
for
oral
testimony,
he
must
furnish.
he
too
when
asked
what
do
you
know
about
the
accident
that
occurred
on
43rd
street
or
when
asked,
what
you
know
about
gambling
in
kell,
illinois,
must
go
through
the
same
cognitive
process,
deciding
whether
he
will
voluntarily
formulate
a
response,
whether
he
will
order
his
body
to
provide
the
evidence
that
will
intelligible
to
the
grand
jury
itself.
he
has
to
create
the
evidence
that
it
has
to
be
laid
before
the
grand
jury.
we
think
that
for
fourth
amendment
purposes
no
more
--
no
less
than
for
fifth
amendment
purposes,
there
is
no
relevant
constitutional
distinction
between
the
giving
of
oral
testimony
that
is
unprivileged
and
the
giving
of
physical
exemplar
evidence
that
is
not
itself
subject
to
an
expectation
of
privacy
and
that
we
submit
is
this
case.
now,
moving
along
to
the
standards
and
as
mr.
justice
stewart
asked
in
the
earlier
case,
if
the
court
agrees
with
the
second
circuit
and
disagrees
with
the
seventh
in
the
dionisio
decision,
and
holds
that
there
is
no
burden
on
the
grand
jury
to
show
reasonableness
before
it
can
expect
compliance
with
its
orders
than
the
two
issues
that
are
before
the
court
in
this
case
become
academic.
that
is
the
procedure
to
be
followed
in
showing
reasonableness
and
the
content
of
the
reasonableness
showing.
but
assuming
the
court,
decides
that
there
is
some
obligation
of
this
sort,
we
submit
that
in
this
kind
of
context,
a
current
ongoing
grand
jury
investigation,
the
procedure
that
was
followed
in
this
case
is
quite
sufficient.
that
is
the
submission
of
an
in
camera
affidavit
which
the
district
judge
can
examine
to
determine
whether
it
is
sufficient.
we
think
that
cases
relied
on
by
the
seventh
circuit
are
quite
at
odds
with
the
customary
obligations
of
adversary
litigation,
and
we
also
emphasize
that
we're
talking
here
about
a
grand
jury
proceeding
where
there
is
a
need
for
dispatch,
there
is
a
need
for
secrecy,
there
is
a
need
for
simplifying
the
proceedings,
especially
when
as
we
believe
is
the
case,
there
are
no
major
constitutional
values
implicated.
now,
the
submission
of
an
ex
parte
affidavit
to
the
court
to
make
some
legal
test
of
it,
of
its
sufficiency
is
not
at
all
unusual
in
this
kind
of
setting.
it
is
the
traditional
procedure
with
the
search
warrant
and
it
is
been
thought
necessary
that
the
warrant
can
actually
be
issued.
this
is
what
actually
happens,
the
warrant
is
issued.
whatever
privacy
is
involved
is
already
invaded
pursuant
to
that
warrant
before
there
is
any
opportunity
to
test
its
sufficiency
and
adversary
proceeding.
but
going
beyond
that,
the
cases
relied
on,
like
davis
against
the
united
states,
the
grand
jury
minutes
case
or
alderman,
the
illegal
electronic
surveillance
case,
talked
about
the
necessity
for
an
adversary
hearing
because
the
inquiry
in
that
area
was
one
of
relevance
and
a
relevance
determination
is
one
that
turns
on
a
lot
subtle
factors,
which
cannot
always
be
recognized
by
a
judge
who
isn’t
as
close
to
the
evidence,
to
the
investigation,
to
the
background
as
the
adverse
party.
but
even
in
alderman,
the
court
said
that
they
are
related
kinds
of
inquiries
that
can
be
made,
and
made
decisively
and
finally
ex
parte
by
the
judge.
and
in
fact
in
subsequent
cases
also
reported
in
the
same
volume
of
the
us
reports,
giordano
and
taglianetti,
the
court
explicitly
affirmed
that
district
judges
acting
in
camera
without
an
adversary
hearing
could
decide
such
issues
as
whether
a
person
had
standing
to
complain
about
a
fourth
amendment
violation
and
could
even
decide
ex
parte
without
any
contest
from
an
adverse
litigant,
that
in
particular
electronic
surveillance
was
legal
and
that
determination
would
not
be
subject
to
any
adversarial
litigation.
we
consider
this
kind
of
case
a
fortiori
because
if
a
district
judge
can
make
a
decisive
and
conclusive
determination
that
an
electronic
surveillance
is
lawful
and
can
make
that
without
giving
any
opportunity
to
the
other
side
to
contest
that
determination,
we
think
in
a
much
more
extreme
posture
of
an
ongoing
grand
jury
investigation,
there
is
even
less
justification
for
demanding
that
the
government
showing
of
reasonableness,
if
any
it
must
make,
must
be
subjected
to
full
litigation.
and
in
this
case,
i
might
point
out
what
we
have
is
an
order
by
the
court
of
appeals
that
the
respondent
in
an
exemplar
case
must
be
given
an
opportunity
to
test
the
sufficiency
of
the
government's
showing,
and
i
think
that
clearly
contemplates
a
full
trial-type
or
hearing-type
proceeding.
that
i
think
is
--
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
well,
in
the
taglianetti
case
which
is
in
394
us,
the
court
summarily
affirmed,
granted
cert
and
affirmed
the
judgment
holding
that
the
district
judge
acted
properly
in
determining
who
had
been
overheard
and
who
had
not
even
though
the
defendant
wanted
to
--
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
yes,
sir.
we're
not
contesting
that
holding.
what
we're
saying
is
that
the
kind
of
inquiry
here
is
quite
different
from
the
relevancy
determination
in
alderman,
where
we
concede
that
it's
difficult
for
a
judge
who
is
not
familiar
with
the
activities
of
the
--
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
pardon?
i'm
sorry.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
that’s
the
underlying
rationale
for
alderman
and
indeed
for
dennis.
it's
difficult
to
make
a
relevancy
determination
ex
parte,
we
concede
that.
here,
we’re
talking
about
not
making
a
relevancy
determination,
but
determining
whether
the
grand
jury
has
a
reasonable
basis
for
asking
a
witness
to
provide
an
exemplar.
we
think
that
is
the
kind
of
determination
that
can
be
made
ex
parte
on
the
basis
of
a
submission
by
the
government.
this
is
the
kind
of
determination
that
a
judge
who
is
presented
with
an
application
for
a
search
warrant
customarily
makes,
and
he
even
has
to
make
higher
standard
of
determination
than
in
this
case,
because
the
seventh
circuit
hasn’t
said
the
probable
cause
is
the
standard.
but
we
are
content
in
our
system
to
allow
district
judges
to
make
ex
parte
determinations
of
probable
cause.
and
i
think,
even
though
you
are
correct
that
the
court
hasn’t
completely
ruled
on
all
of
these
electronic
surveillance
issues
in
taglianetti
as
i
say,
the
court
did
affirm
the
ex
parte
procedure
that
was
followed
in
the
determining
who
had
been
overheard
and
who
hadn’t,
and
in
giordano,
which
was
a
master
order
sending
back
for
further
proceedings
in
a
number
of
electronic
surveillance
cases,
mr.
justice
stewart
explicitly
stating
in
his
concurring
opinion
that
the
court
was
in
no
way
intimating
that
ex
parte
proceedings
were
not
satisfactory
to
determine
legality
and
that
in
fact
has
been
the
process
that’s
been
followed
in
lower
courts.
so,
we
think
then
the
rationale
for
the
adversary
hearing
cases
is
inapplicable.
on
the
other
side,
we
have
what
is
a
legitimate
value,
and
that
is
the
value
of
grand
jury
secrecies.
we're
not
talking
now
about
attempts
to
keep
the
minutes
of
grand
jury
proceedings
secret
so
that
they
can't
be
used
to
impeach
a
witness
when
he
testifies
years
afterwards.
we’re
talking
about
a
requirement
that
the
seventh
circuit
has
imposed,
that
the
government
make
an
open
showing
of
the
current
status
of
a
grand
jury
proceeding.
we
think
that
is
probably
the
--
as
a
distant
from
the
legitimate
purposes
of
grand
jury
secrecy
which
are
designed
to
provide
the
grand
jury
an
opportunity
to
pursue
its
investigation
without
providing
any
tip
off
either
to
the
witnesses
or
to
other
people
who
may
not
be
called
before
the
grand
jury
about
the
focus
of
the
grand
jury's
investigation,
its
progress
thus
far,
which
witnesses
may
so
far
have
been
called
before
or
which
witnesses
may
not
had
been?
we
think
that
balancing
those
two
factors,
the
lack
of
any
substantial
need
for
an
adversary
litigation
of
a
showing
of
reasonableness
against
the
very
considerable
interest
of
preserving
the
secrecy
of
an
ongoing
grand
jury
combined
to
render
the
seventh
circuit's
decision
wrong.
the
separate
inquiry
of
course
is
one
of
the
standard
of
reasonableness
of
the
seventh
circuit
in
explaining
what
it
meant
in
dionisio
by
listing
all
of
the
criteria
that
must
be
met
here,
i
think
it
has
gone
far
beyond
with
this
court
has
ever
intimated,
must
be
shown,
certainly
in
any
grand
jury
investigation.
the
court
imposes
a
very
stringent
obligation
of
showing
relevancy
which
is
perhaps
even
more
intense
than
the
similar
suggestion
that
had
been
made
and
rejected
in
branzburg
and
i
think,
it
is
our
position
for
a
much
less
justifiable
constitutional
objective.
furthermore,
the
requirement
that
the
government
--
the
grand
jury
must
show
the
evidence
is
not
otherwise
available.
another
criterion
that
was
rejected
in
branzburg
is
unwarranted,
is
somewhat
unrealistic
because
at
the
one
end,
if
the
witness
himself
is
agreeable
to
providing
a
grand
jury
--
providing
a
handwriting
exemplar,
we
don’t
have
the
litigation
that
we're
confronted
with
today
where
the
witness
refuses
on
constitutional
grounds
to
cooperate.
on
the
hand,
it's
not
difficult
to
see
that
using
other
investigative
channels
to
secure
handwriting
exemplars
maybe
even
more
intrusive
on
fourth
amendment
interests,
then
is
issuing
court
process,
asking
a
person
to
come
to
the
united
states
courthouse
where
in
secrecy
he
can
provide
an
exemplar.
it
would
be
possible
presumably
for
fbi
agents
to
go
to
a
person’s
bank,
or
to
a
credit
agency,
or
to
his
employer,
and
ask
whether
they
will
supply
exemplars
of
the
--
would
be
witness'
handwriting.
i
don’t
think
that
the
court
should
regard
the
lack
of
use
of
those
alternatives
as
something
the
government
must
affirmatively
apologize
for,
before
it
asks
a
grand
jury
witness
to
provide
exemplars.
the
level
of
the
showing
that
the
seventh
circuit
has
imposed
in
this
decision,
i
think
can
best
be
illustrated
by
a
reading
of
the
government’s
petition
before
the
district
court
which
set
out
specifically
the
offense
that
was
being
investigated
by
the
grand
jury,
which
set
out
specifically
that
the
grand
jury
thought
it
necessary
for
this
witness
to
provide
handwriting
and
printing
exemplars
so
that
the
grand
jury
could
determine
whether
he
was
the
author
of
particular
writings
already
before
the
grand
jury.
in
that
context,
i
think,
if
that
showing
does
not
meet
whatever
reasonableness
showing
the
constitution
may
call
for,
of
course,
we
argue
that
it
calls
for
none,
the
standard
must
be
something
quite
close
to
probable
cause
which
is
an
anomalous
requirement
since
probable
cause
is
the
end
of
the
grand
jury's
inquiry
not
its
beginning.
for
that
reason,
we
request
that
the
judgment
seventh
circuit
be
reversed.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
unless
the
court
has
any
further
questions,
the
government
will
waive
rebuttal.
