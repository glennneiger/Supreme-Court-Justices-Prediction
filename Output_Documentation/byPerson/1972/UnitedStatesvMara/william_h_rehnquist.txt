if
it
is
testimony,
you
have
the

amendment
available?
justice
william

that's
something
you
have
no
way
of
knowing
until
you
know
what
the
--
until
he
actually
goes
before
the
grand
jury
and
gives
whatever
form
of
exemplar
they
want?
justice
william

rehnquist
if
the
point
you’re
trying
to
reserve
is
not
that
anything
which
contributes
to
the
government’s
case
even
a
set
of
20
neutral
words
as
posited
by
the
chief
justice,
but
that
what
you
might
be
asked
for
before
the
grand
jury
is,
you
know,
where
were
you
on
the
night
of
january
20th?
isn’t
the
way
to
preserve
that
to
go
before
the
grand
jury
and
let
them
ask
that
question
and
then
raise
your
fifth
amendment
point?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
isn’t
it
true,
mr.
ruggiero,
at
least
in
connection
with
the
search
warrant
or
an
arrest
warrant
that
your
normal
motion
to
quash
comes
up
after
the
search
has
been
made
or
after
the
arrest
has
been
made.
and
whereas
at
that
time
you
may
have
a
right
to
examine
the
affidavit,
you
don’t
have
any
right
to
insist
that
the
magistrate
give
you
a
hearing
before
you
are
to
be
arrested
or
before
you
are
to
be
searched?

mrs.
bamberger,
i
take
it
one
differing
factor
between
your
application
of
the
deposition
rules
of
relevancy
in
a
grand
jury
proceedings
is
that
in
your
civil
proceeding,
your
issues
are
pretty
well
delineated
by
your
complaint
and
answer
whereas
you
don’t
have
any
similar
format
for
the
grand
jury
proceeding
that
would
enable
you
to
say,
is
it
or
is
it
not
within
the
limits
framed
by
a
particular
set
of
documents?
