ms.
phylis
skloot
bamberger
thank
you.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
it
seems
that
there
are
two
problems
for
consideration
by
the
court.
the
first
is
whether
a
non-testimonial
characteristics
are
protected
by
the
fourth
amendment
and
the
second
is
assuming
that
they
are
whether
there
are
some
fourth
amendment
limitation
upon
the
grand
jury
in
their
attempt
to
get
such
characteristics.
we
believe
that
some
characteristics
are
protected
and
that
handwriting
exemplars
is
one
of
the
ones
that
is
protected.
the
particular
exemplars
sought
by
any
agency
is
not
in
plain
view
and
that
is
the
reason
why
the
particular
agency
or
the
grand
jury
must
seek
it.
furthermore,
the
authorship
of
the
exemplar
which
is
already
in
the
possession
of
the
intervening
investigating
agency
or
the
grand
jury
is
unknown.
so
that,
that
factor
is
very
private,
just
as
is
the
fact
of
making
that
particular
exemplar
which
is
requested.
ms.
phylis
skloot
bamberger
i
would
take
the
same
position
with
respect
to
fingerprints.
i
think
that
there
were
some
distinctions
which
was
raised
by
the
court
before
with
respect
to
voice.
the
person
coming
before
the
grand
jury
generally
responds
with
his
voice
and
if
the
government
can
use
that
as
a
particular
way
of
securing
an
exemplar,
that
is
distinguished
from
the
usual
--
that
the
handwriting
exemplar
which
is
generally
not
use
as
a
means
of
communication
unless
the
defendant
wishes
to
do
it
or
unless
the
witness
wishes
to
do
it
that
way.
also
the
question
of
the
scar
in
a
generally
undisclosed
place,
i
think
that
is
protected.
on
the
other
hand,
facial
features
or
scar
on
the
face
would
not
be
protected.
i
think
we
have
to
look
at
the
normal
context
of
things.
what
is
generally
in
open
view
and
what
is
generally
not
in
open
view
to
be
produced
or
created
or
performed
by
the
individual
in
the
context
of
the
situation.
i
think,
if
we
look
at
schmerber
and
davis,
we
can
come
to
the
conclusion
that
handwriting
exemplars
are
indeed
protected
by
the
fourth
amendment.
in
schmerber,
the
question
was
whether
the
government
had
to
get
a
warrant,
to
get
a
blood
sample
after
a
person
was
properly
arrested,
based
on
probable
cause.
and
the
holding
there
was
that
they
didn’t
have
to
get
the
warrant
because
there
were
exigent
circumstances
and
there
was
probable
cause
for
the
arrest.
so,
we
come
to
the
particular
circumstance
that
blood
is
protected.
if
we
look
at
davis,
this
court
is
quite
correct
in
stating
that
the
holding
in
davis
does
not
say
that
fingerprinting
is
protected
by
the
fourth
amendment.
they
didn’t
have
to
say
it
there
because
it
was
obtained
in
otherwise
unconstitutional
circumstances.
but
i
think
the
inference
from
davis
is
that
indeed
it
is
the
fingerprint
itself
and
not
the
context
in
which
it
was
taken
which
controls
because
otherwise,
the
court
would
not
have
had
to
have
gone
to
such
great
lengths
to
explain
that
fingerprints
are
reliable
because
they
are
unique,
because
they
could
be
obtained
in
a
one
shot
affair,
because
it's
not
necessary
to
repeat,
because
it's
a
simple
procedure.
if
we
were
talking
about
the
means
or
the
context
in
which
the
exemplar
was
taken
or
the
fingerprints
were
taken
that
would
be
one
thing.
but
the
court
went
on
to
davis
to
explain
by
a
lower
standard
for
obtaining
fingerprint
would
be
permissible;
looking
at
the
characteristics
of
the
fingerprints
and
not
at
the
characteristics
of
the
proceeding
in
which
it
was
obtained.
proposed
rule
41
(1),
i
think
shares
or
draws
from
davis
this
implication
because
under
41
(1)
(h)
(6),
a
person
who
is
requested
to
give
non-testimonial
identification
can
come
to
the
magistrate
who
issued
the
order
and
say
can
this
be
taken
at
my
home.
and
if
it
--
and
assuming
that
it
can
be
taken
at
his
home
or
not
in
a
government
agency
or
not
in
a
courtroom,
there
is
nothing
inherently
coercive.
we're
not
talking
about
a
custodial
situation
such
as
a
police
station
and
i
think
that’s
where
the
second
circuit’s
opinion
in
short
is
in
error
by
combining
the
characteristic
exemplar
with
the
atmosphere
in
which
it
was
taken.
if
we
look
to
the
question
of
whether
the
fourth
amendment
should
apply
to
the
grand
jury,
the
government
keeps
arguing
and
as
it
has
before
that
the
grand
jury’s
powers
are
unlimited,
they
refer
to
branzburg,
they
refer
to
blair.
but
in
every
one
of
these
cases,
the
question
which
was
raised
was
one
of
testimony
which
has
been
traditionally
protected
by
the
fifth
amendment.
never,
except
in
these
recent
series
of
cases,
including
another
second
circuit
decision,
us
against
doe
--
(devlin)
has
the
scope
of
the
grand
jury
gone
beyond
testimonial
items
and
i
include
within
that
context,
books,
and
records
and
documents.
this
is
a
new
expansion.
it
appears
from
the
history
of
the
grand
jury
process
into
areas
not
before
covered
by
the
grand
jury
process.
now,
i
think
that
that
distinguishes
cases
like
branzburg
and
blair
which
deal
with
the
traditional
grand
jury
power
to
secure
testimony
subject
to
the
fifth
amendment
protection.
and
i
think
that
the
government
in
explaining
the
scope
of
the
grand
jury
power
forgets
that
even
the
power
to
get
testimonial
evidence
is
limited
by
the
fifth
amendment.
so,
it
seems
that
where
the
grand
jury
power
is
to
go
beyond
its
traditional
scope
of
requesting
testimonial
evidence,
including
books
and
records
which
is
protected
by
the
fifth
amendment,
to
something
non-testimonial,
that
the
non-testimonial
aspect
should
also
be
protected
and
the
grand
jury’s
power
limited
in
an
appropriate
--
by
an
appropriate
constitutional
protection
in
that
way.
historically,
i
think
the
balance
fits
properly.
historically
as
i
said,
the
fifth
amendment
protected
against
invasions
of
testimonial
evidence.
there
was
no
need
to
apply
the
fourth
amendment
because
the
grand
jury
didn’t
seek
such
evidence.
with
wade
and
gilbert,
this
other
evidence
is
now
considered
to
be
non-testimonial.
if
the
grand
jury
wishes
to
secure
that
evidence
by
not
affording
some
protection
against
the
request
for
it,
the
power
of
the
grand
jury
is
greatly
broadened
beyond
what
it
has
traditionally
been
and
i
might
add
that
the
opinion
in
us
against
doe
(schwartz)
refers
to
the
fact
that
rule
41
(1)
refers
to
a
second
circuit
opinion
in
us
against
doe
(devlin),
but
in
doe
(devlin)
the
fourth
amendment
issue
was
never
raised.
it
was
ordered
entirely
on
the
fifth
amendment
and
the
issue
in
doe
(devlin)
was
whether
a
person
could
be
punished
for
contempt
for
refusing
to
give
the
requested
exemplar
when
if
they
had
refuse
to
give
that
same
exemplar
to
a
police
office
coming
for
it,
they
could
not
be
held
in
contempt
and
of
course,
that's
one
of
the
problems
we
have
which
is
posed
here.
if
an
individual
refuses
to
give
a
policeman
or
an
fbi
agent
or
some
other
government
agent
an
exemplar
where
they
do
not
come
with
the
court
order,
they
cannot
be
punish
for
it.
on
the
other
hand,
if
they
refuse
to
give
that
same
exemplar
to
grand
jury
that
requests
it,
under
the
position
taken
by
the
government,
they
can
be
held
in
contempt.
i
think
that
the
standard
for
determining
if
the
fourth
amendment
applies
as
we
assert
it
does,
the
standard
for
determining
when
the
government
can
secure
this
evidence
has
been
outlined
in
such
cases
as
camara
and
terry
where
the
court
is
willing
to
say,
“let
us
balance.
what
are
the
needs
on
one
side?
what
are
the
constitutional
protections
on
the
other
side?”
and
i
think
that
if
we
look
at
in
that
context,
we
can
come
out
with
a
test
which
satisfies
both
requirements.
ms.
phylis
skloot
bamberger
thank
you,
your
honor.
the
government
claims
that
the
interruption
of
the
grand
jury
process
is
a
policy
against
permitting
an
adversary
hearing
in
this
context.
the
context
here
is
one
of
the
contempt
preceding.
that
has
always
been
the
exception
on
the
cases
like
cobbledick
and
gabel
(ph)
and
costello
for
a
challenge
to
the
grand
jury
process.
and
traditionally,
an
attack
on
the
grand
jury
process
in
terms
of
a
refusal
to
obey,
means
that
the
case
goes
to
a
court
for
purposes
of
the
contempt
proceeding.
and
it
is
in
that
context,
that
it
is
appropriate,
that
the
witness
in
this
context
where
he
claims
the
fourth
amendment
privilege
be
permitted
to
challenge
the
subpoena
requiring
production
of
the
exemplar.
it
is
the
court
and
the
not
the
grand
jury
that
would
make
the
determination
as
to
whether
the
constitution
is
a
protection.
there
is
no
fact
question
involved
in
the
ultimate
sense.
it's
a
constitutional
question
which
must
be
resolved
by
the
court.
if
we
look
at
the
warrant
situation
as
an
analogy
to
this
one,
it
is
true
that
a
warrant
is
obtained
in
an
ex-parte
proceeding.
however,
usually
in
the
warrant
context
there
is
a
need
for
speed
to
prevent
the
destruction
of
evidence
or
to
make
sure
that
the
defendant
does
not
plead.
and
then,
there
is
suppression
hearing,
if
the
defendant
isn’t
--
the
potential
defendant
is
indicted
and
if
the
search
was
unreasonable
in
the
sense,
for
instance,
if
the
warrant
is
refused
and
the
defendant’s
house
or
office
is
torn
apart,
there
maybe
a
civil
damages
action.
here
in
this
context
as
i
said,
there
is
no
need
for
speed.
the
defendant
is
around
or
the
witness
is
around.
he
is
unlikely
to
destroy
his
hand
so
that
he
will
not
give
an
exemplar
or
to
cut
off
his
hair
so
that
he
need
not
give
a
hair
sample.
in
any
case,
the
hair
can
grow
back
and
so,
we
have
a
real
difference
in
need
in
this
situation.
and
just
briefly
to
summarize
there
is
an
intrusion
here.
the
intrusion
is
not
an
invasion
into
the
body
as
it
is
in
the
context
of
blood,
but
it
is
a
compulsion
by
an
order
to
produce
something.
and
under
this
court
decision
in
morton
salt,
we
look
at
the
way
in
which
the
item
can
be
obtained
to
determine
if
there
is
an
intrusion
and
here
compulsion
is
equal
to
intrusion.
ms.
phylis
skloot
bamberger
by
way
of
--
well,
--
ms.
phylis
skloot
bamberger
the
--
i
think
the
fourth
--
the
seventh
circuit
test
is
correct
--
ms.
phylis
skloot
bamberger
well,
we
would
--
we
would
add
one
more
thing
to
that
and
that
is
--
ms.
phylis
skloot
bamberger
yes,
i
think
that
there
should
be
a
determination
of
relevancy
not
that
--
based
on
the
kind
of
reasonableness
and
not
probable
cause
to
believe
that
this
exemplar
is
the
same
thing,
not
probable
cause
to
believe
that
this
witness
will
become
a
defendant,
but
a
standard
of
reasonableness
and
an
explanation
of
how
this
particular
piece
of
evidence,
the
exemplar
is
relevant
to
the
investigation.
and
i
don’t
think
that
would
reveal
too
much
into
--
ms.
phylis
skloot
bamberger
you
mean
in
civil
matters?
ms.
phylis
skloot
bamberger
yes,
i
understand
that,
your
honor,
and
i
think
that
perhaps
in
this
case,
if
we
look
to
--
that
it
has
to
be,
that
it
should
be
a
statement
merely
or
a
factual
statement
that
the
--
let
me
say
this,
it
may
not
be
as
broad
but
there
must
be
some
basis
for
concluding
that
the
testimony
requested
is
relevant
to
the
investigation
going
on
at
that
time.
ms.
phylis
skloot
bamberger
that
it
will
aid
the
investigation,
yes.
ms.
phylis
skloot
bamberger
well,
you
do
that
your
honor,
in
--
ms.
phylis
skloot
bamberger
yes,
it
is,
your
honor.
but
this
a
--
this
would
be
a
proceeding
which
would
occur
and
accord
in
a
contempt
proceeding.
in
other
words,
we're
not
urging
an
independent
proceeding
but
(voice
overlap).
ms.
phylis
skloot
bamberger
well,
it
seems
to
me,
your
honor,
that
the
court
could
be
fully
advised
and
if
the
government
believes
in
a
particular
case,
that
advising
the
court
to
the
extent
that
it
need
advise
the
court,
in
order
to
advise
him
as
to
what's
going
on
--
ms.
phylis
skloot
bamberger
in
a
specific
application
so
that
each
individual
application
can
be
determine
on
its
own
merits,
not
a
general
across
the
board,
application
of
the
ex-parte
in
camera
proceeding
in
this
context.
the
court
does
that
or
in
suppression
hearings
also
when
the
informant’s
name
must
be
kept
secret
for
his
protection.
the
government
can
go
and
request
such
an
ex-parte
revelation
of
the
informant’s
whereabout
to
name.
the
same
thing
can
be
applied
here
on
a
case
by
case
basis.
ms.
phylis
skloot
bamberger
well,
in
the
context
of
the
grand
jury
proceedings
that
--
what
you
say
about
the
civil
proceeding
is
correct
and
i
would
say
that
in
the
context
of
a
grand
jury
proceeding,
the
usual
way
it
comes
up
is
that
the
government
has
collected
some
kind
of
case
and
has
prepared
an
indictment
and
it
goes
to
the
grand
jury
to
present
its
evidence
and
it
has
a
framework
with
which
it
could
make
a
presentation
to
a
district
court
in
a
contempt
proceeding
and
the
government
is
not
functioning
in
a
vacuum.
they
have
obviously
done
more
upon
that.
now,
in
the
context
of
the
grand
jury
doing
its
own
investigation,
where
there
is
no
government
presentation,
the
grand
jury,
i
think
in
order
to
demand
an
exemplar
must
tell
the
district
court
once
again
that
its
investigation
has
led
it
to
a
certain
point
on
which
they
believe
that
the
exemplar
would
be
relevant.
in
the
sense
that
it
would
be
helpful
in
determining
if
this
particular
person
was
connected
to
the
crime
which
it
was
investigating.
of
course,
in
that
case
i
would
assume
also
they
would
have
to
seek
the
aid
of
the
us
attorney
in
making
the
application
to
the
court
for
a
petition,
in
case
the
witness
refused
to
comply
with
the
request
of
the
grand
jury.
ms.
phylis
skloot
bamberger
thank
you.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
it
seems
that
there
are
two
problems
for
consideration
by
the
court.
the
first
is
whether
a
non-testimonial
characteristics
are
protected
by
the
fourth
amendment
and
the
second
is
assuming
that
they
are
whether
there
are
some
fourth
amendment
limitation
upon
the
grand
jury
in
their
attempt
to
get
such
characteristics.
we
believe
that
some
characteristics
are
protected
and
that
handwriting
exemplars
is
one
of
the
ones
that
is
protected.
the
particular
exemplars
sought
by
any
agency
is
not
in
plain
view
and
that
is
the
reason
why
the
particular
agency
or
the
grand
jury
must
seek
it.
furthermore,
the
authorship
of
the
exemplar
which
is
already
in
the
possession
of
the
intervening
investigating
agency
or
the
grand
jury
is
unknown.
so
that,
that
factor
is
very
private,
just
as
is
the
fact
of
making
that
particular
exemplar
which
is
requested.
ms.
phylis
skloot
bamberger
i
would
take
the
same
position
with
respect
to
fingerprints.
i
think
that
there
were
some
distinctions
which
was
raised
by
the
court
before
with
respect
to
voice.
the
person
coming
before
the
grand
jury
generally
responds
with
his
voice
and
if
the
government
can
use
that
as
a
particular
way
of
securing
an
exemplar,
that
is
distinguished
from
the
usual
--
that
the
handwriting
exemplar
which
is
generally
not
use
as
a
means
of
communication
unless
the
defendant
wishes
to
do
it
or
unless
the
witness
wishes
to
do
it
that
way.
also
the
question
of
the
scar
in
a
generally
undisclosed
place,
i
think
that
is
protected.
on
the
other
hand,
facial
features
or
scar
on
the
face
would
not
be
protected.
i
think
we
have
to
look
at
the
normal
context
of
things.
what
is
generally
in
open
view
and
what
is
generally
not
in
open
view
to
be
produced
or
created
or
performed
by
the
individual
in
the
context
of
the
situation.
i
think,
if
we
look
at
schmerber
and
davis,
we
can
come
to
the
conclusion
that
handwriting
exemplars
are
indeed
protected
by
the
fourth
amendment.
in
schmerber,
the
question
was
whether
the
government
had
to
get
a
warrant,
to
get
a
blood
sample
after
a
person
was
properly
arrested,
based
on
probable
cause.
and
the
holding
there
was
that
they
didn’t
have
to
get
the
warrant
because
there
were
exigent
circumstances
and
there
was
probable
cause
for
the
arrest.
so,
we
come
to
the
particular
circumstance
that
blood
is
protected.
if
we
look
at
davis,
this
court
is
quite
correct
in
stating
that
the
holding
in
davis
does
not
say
that
fingerprinting
is
protected
by
the
fourth
amendment.
they
didn’t
have
to
say
it
there
because
it
was
obtained
in
otherwise
unconstitutional
circumstances.
but
i
think
the
inference
from
davis
is
that
indeed
it
is
the
fingerprint
itself
and
not
the
context
in
which
it
was
taken
which
controls
because
otherwise,
the
court
would
not
have
had
to
have
gone
to
such
great
lengths
to
explain
that
fingerprints
are
reliable
because
they
are
unique,
because
they
could
be
obtained
in
a
one
shot
affair,
because
it's
not
necessary
to
repeat,
because
it's
a
simple
procedure.
if
we
were
talking
about
the
means
or
the
context
in
which
the
exemplar
was
taken
or
the
fingerprints
were
taken
that
would
be
one
thing.
but
the
court
went
on
to
davis
to
explain
by
a
lower
standard
for
obtaining
fingerprint
would
be
permissible;
looking
at
the
characteristics
of
the
fingerprints
and
not
at
the
characteristics
of
the
proceeding
in
which
it
was
obtained.
proposed
rule
41
(1),
i
think
shares
or
draws
from
davis
this
implication
because
under
41
(1)
(h)
(6),
a
person
who
is
requested
to
give
non-testimonial
identification
can
come
to
the
magistrate
who
issued
the
order
and
say
can
this
be
taken
at
my
home.
and
if
it
--
and
assuming
that
it
can
be
taken
at
his
home
or
not
in
a
government
agency
or
not
in
a
courtroom,
there
is
nothing
inherently
coercive.
we're
not
talking
about
a
custodial
situation
such
as
a
police
station
and
i
think
that’s
where
the
second
circuit’s
opinion
in
short
is
in
error
by
combining
the
characteristic
exemplar
with
the
atmosphere
in
which
it
was
taken.
if
we
look
to
the
question
of
whether
the
fourth
amendment
should
apply
to
the
grand
jury,
the
government
keeps
arguing
and
as
it
has
before
that
the
grand
jury’s
powers
are
unlimited,
they
refer
to
branzburg,
they
refer
to
blair.
but
in
every
one
of
these
cases,
the
question
which
was
raised
was
one
of
testimony
which
has
been
traditionally
protected
by
the
fifth
amendment.
never,
except
in
these
recent
series
of
cases,
including
another
second
circuit
decision,
us
against
doe
--
(devlin)
has
the
scope
of
the
grand
jury
gone
beyond
testimonial
items
and
i
include
within
that
context,
books,
and
records
and
documents.
this
is
a
new
expansion.
it
appears
from
the
history
of
the
grand
jury
process
into
areas
not
before
covered
by
the
grand
jury
process.
now,
i
think
that
that
distinguishes
cases
like
branzburg
and
blair
which
deal
with
the
traditional
grand
jury
power
to
secure
testimony
subject
to
the
fifth
amendment
protection.
and
i
think
that
the
government
in
explaining
the
scope
of
the
grand
jury
power
forgets
that
even
the
power
to
get
testimonial
evidence
is
limited
by
the
fifth
amendment.
so,
it
seems
that
where
the
grand
jury
power
is
to
go
beyond
its
traditional
scope
of
requesting
testimonial
evidence,
including
books
and
records
which
is
protected
by
the
fifth
amendment,
to
something
non-testimonial,
that
the
non-testimonial
aspect
should
also
be
protected
and
the
grand
jury’s
power
limited
in
an
appropriate
--
by
an
appropriate
constitutional
protection
in
that
way.
historically,
i
think
the
balance
fits
properly.
historically
as
i
said,
the
fifth
amendment
protected
against
invasions
of
testimonial
evidence.
there
was
no
need
to
apply
the
fourth
amendment
because
the
grand
jury
didn’t
seek
such
evidence.
with
wade
and
gilbert,
this
other
evidence
is
now
considered
to
be
non-testimonial.
if
the
grand
jury
wishes
to
secure
that
evidence
by
not
affording
some
protection
against
the
request
for
it,
the
power
of
the
grand
jury
is
greatly
broadened
beyond
what
it
has
traditionally
been
and
i
might
add
that
the
opinion
in
us
against
doe
(schwartz)
refers
to
the
fact
that
rule
41
(1)
refers
to
a
second
circuit
opinion
in
us
against
doe
(devlin),
but
in
doe
(devlin)
the
fourth
amendment
issue
was
never
raised.
it
was
ordered
entirely
on
the
fifth
amendment
and
the
issue
in
doe
(devlin)
was
whether
a
person
could
be
punished
for
contempt
for
refusing
to
give
the
requested
exemplar
when
if
they
had
refuse
to
give
that
same
exemplar
to
a
police
office
coming
for
it,
they
could
not
be
held
in
contempt
and
of
course,
that's
one
of
the
problems
we
have
which
is
posed
here.
if
an
individual
refuses
to
give
a
policeman
or
an
fbi
agent
or
some
other
government
agent
an
exemplar
where
they
do
not
come
with
the
court
order,
they
cannot
be
punish
for
it.
on
the
other
hand,
if
they
refuse
to
give
that
same
exemplar
to
grand
jury
that
requests
it,
under
the
position
taken
by
the
government,
they
can
be
held
in
contempt.
i
think
that
the
standard
for
determining
if
the
fourth
amendment
applies
as
we
assert
it
does,
the
standard
for
determining
when
the
government
can
secure
this
evidence
has
been
outlined
in
such
cases
as
camara
and
terry
where
the
court
is
willing
to
say,
“let
us
balance.
what
are
the
needs
on
one
side?
what
are
the
constitutional
protections
on
the
other
side?”
and
i
think
that
if
we
look
at
in
that
context,
we
can
come
out
with
a
test
which
satisfies
both
requirements.
ms.
phylis
skloot
bamberger
thank
you,
your
honor.
the
government
claims
that
the
interruption
of
the
grand
jury
process
is
a
policy
against
permitting
an
adversary
hearing
in
this
context.
the
context
here
is
one
of
the
contempt
preceding.
that
has
always
been
the
exception
on
the
cases
like
cobbledick
and
gabel
(ph)
and
costello
for
a
challenge
to
the
grand
jury
process.
and
traditionally,
an
attack
on
the
grand
jury
process
in
terms
of
a
refusal
to
obey,
means
that
the
case
goes
to
a
court
for
purposes
of
the
contempt
proceeding.
and
it
is
in
that
context,
that
it
is
appropriate,
that
the
witness
in
this
context
where
he
claims
the
fourth
amendment
privilege
be
permitted
to
challenge
the
subpoena
requiring
production
of
the
exemplar.
it
is
the
court
and
the
not
the
grand
jury
that
would
make
the
determination
as
to
whether
the
constitution
is
a
protection.
there
is
no
fact
question
involved
in
the
ultimate
sense.
it's
a
constitutional
question
which
must
be
resolved
by
the
court.
if
we
look
at
the
warrant
situation
as
an
analogy
to
this
one,
it
is
true
that
a
warrant
is
obtained
in
an
ex-parte
proceeding.
however,
usually
in
the
warrant
context
there
is
a
need
for
speed
to
prevent
the
destruction
of
evidence
or
to
make
sure
that
the
defendant
does
not
plead.
and
then,
there
is
suppression
hearing,
if
the
defendant
isn’t
--
the
potential
defendant
is
indicted
and
if
the
search
was
unreasonable
in
the
sense,
for
instance,
if
the
warrant
is
refused
and
the
defendant’s
house
or
office
is
torn
apart,
there
maybe
a
civil
damages
action.
here
in
this
context
as
i
said,
there
is
no
need
for
speed.
the
defendant
is
around
or
the
witness
is
around.
he
is
unlikely
to
destroy
his
hand
so
that
he
will
not
give
an
exemplar
or
to
cut
off
his
hair
so
that
he
need
not
give
a
hair
sample.
in
any
case,
the
hair
can
grow
back
and
so,
we
have
a
real
difference
in
need
in
this
situation.
and
just
briefly
to
summarize
there
is
an
intrusion
here.
the
intrusion
is
not
an
invasion
into
the
body
as
it
is
in
the
context
of
blood,
but
it
is
a
compulsion
by
an
order
to
produce
something.
and
under
this
court
decision
in
morton
salt,
we
look
at
the
way
in
which
the
item
can
be
obtained
to
determine
if
there
is
an
intrusion
and
here
compulsion
is
equal
to
intrusion.
ms.
phylis
skloot
bamberger
by
way
of
--
well,
--
ms.
phylis
skloot
bamberger
the
--
i
think
the
fourth
--
the
seventh
circuit
test
is
correct
--
ms.
phylis
skloot
bamberger
well,
we
would
--
we
would
add
one
more
thing
to
that
and
that
is
--
ms.
phylis
skloot
bamberger
yes,
i
think
that
there
should
be
a
determination
of
relevancy
not
that
--
based
on
the
kind
of
reasonableness
and
not
probable
cause
to
believe
that
this
exemplar
is
the
same
thing,
not
probable
cause
to
believe
that
this
witness
will
become
a
defendant,
but
a
standard
of
reasonableness
and
an
explanation
of
how
this
particular
piece
of
evidence,
the
exemplar
is
relevant
to
the
investigation.
and
i
don’t
think
that
would
reveal
too
much
into
--
ms.
phylis
skloot
bamberger
you
mean
in
civil
matters?
ms.
phylis
skloot
bamberger
yes,
i
understand
that,
your
honor,
and
i
think
that
perhaps
in
this
case,
if
we
look
to
--
that
it
has
to
be,
that
it
should
be
a
statement
merely
or
a
factual
statement
that
the
--
let
me
say
this,
it
may
not
be
as
broad
but
there
must
be
some
basis
for
concluding
that
the
testimony
requested
is
relevant
to
the
investigation
going
on
at
that
time.
ms.
phylis
skloot
bamberger
that
it
will
aid
the
investigation,
yes.
ms.
phylis
skloot
bamberger
well,
you
do
that
your
honor,
in
--
ms.
phylis
skloot
bamberger
yes,
it
is,
your
honor.
but
this
a
--
this
would
be
a
proceeding
which
would
occur
and
accord
in
a
contempt
proceeding.
in
other
words,
we're
not
urging
an
independent
proceeding
but
(voice
overlap).
ms.
phylis
skloot
bamberger
well,
it
seems
to
me,
your
honor,
that
the
court
could
be
fully
advised
and
if
the
government
believes
in
a
particular
case,
that
advising
the
court
to
the
extent
that
it
need
advise
the
court,
in
order
to
advise
him
as
to
what's
going
on
--
ms.
phylis
skloot
bamberger
in
a
specific
application
so
that
each
individual
application
can
be
determine
on
its
own
merits,
not
a
general
across
the
board,
application
of
the
ex-parte
in
camera
proceeding
in
this
context.
the
court
does
that
or
in
suppression
hearings
also
when
the
informant’s
name
must
be
kept
secret
for
his
protection.
the
government
can
go
and
request
such
an
ex-parte
revelation
of
the
informant’s
whereabout
to
name.
the
same
thing
can
be
applied
here
on
a
case
by
case
basis.
ms.
phylis
skloot
bamberger
well,
in
the
context
of
the
grand
jury
proceedings
that
--
what
you
say
about
the
civil
proceeding
is
correct
and
i
would
say
that
in
the
context
of
a
grand
jury
proceeding,
the
usual
way
it
comes
up
is
that
the
government
has
collected
some
kind
of
case
and
has
prepared
an
indictment
and
it
goes
to
the
grand
jury
to
present
its
evidence
and
it
has
a
framework
with
which
it
could
make
a
presentation
to
a
district
court
in
a
contempt
proceeding
and
the
government
is
not
functioning
in
a
vacuum.
they
have
obviously
done
more
upon
that.
now,
in
the
context
of
the
grand
jury
doing
its
own
investigation,
where
there
is
no
government
presentation,
the
grand
jury,
i
think
in
order
to
demand
an
exemplar
must
tell
the
district
court
once
again
that
its
investigation
has
led
it
to
a
certain
point
on
which
they
believe
that
the
exemplar
would
be
relevant.
in
the
sense
that
it
would
be
helpful
in
determining
if
this
particular
person
was
connected
to
the
crime
which
it
was
investigating.
of
course,
in
that
case
i
would
assume
also
they
would
have
to
seek
the
aid
of
the
us
attorney
in
making
the
application
to
the
court
for
a
petition,
in
case
the
witness
refused
to
comply
with
the
request
of
the
grand
jury.
