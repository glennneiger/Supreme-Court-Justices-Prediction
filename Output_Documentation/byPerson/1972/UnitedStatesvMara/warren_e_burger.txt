chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we’ll
hear
arguments
next
in
number
71-850,
united
states
against
mara.
mr.
lacovara
you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well
mr.
lacovara.
mr.
ruggiero.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
let
me
see
if
i
get
this
clear.
you're
suggesting
that
perhaps
the
government
is
after
something
by
way
of
communication
of
ideas
and
facts
as
distinguished
from
just
a
sample,
a
neutral
sample
of
handwriting?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
if
the
grand
jury
furnished
him
with
the
typewritten
list
of
words,
totally
unconnected,
no
message
at
all,
just
a
list
of
40
words
or
20
words
and
20
names,
and
ask
him
to
write
that
down,
would
your
position
be
the
same
as
it
is
now?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
so
that
then
it
does
not
go
to
the
communication
issue
that
you're
--
alone
that
you
first
suggested.
if
it
will
help,
make
a
case
against
him,
you
say
its
prohibited?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
isn’t
the
demand
for
an
exemplar
by
its
very
nature,
a
neutral
demand
and
not
a
demand
for
communication?
he
could
--
could
he
not
when
if
they
asked
him
the
question
and
right
out
telling
us
where
you
were
at
9
o’clock
on
the
night
of
january
21st.
he
--
that
would
be
the
time
to
refuse
on
fifth
amendment
grounds,
but
if
they
gave
him
the
list
of
neutral
names
and
neutral
words,
you
say
you
would
still
not
do
it.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
how
can
you
know
that
until
the
case
is
tried?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
then
you
say
--
then
in
effect
you’re
saying,
you
don’t
have
to
give
any
handwriting
for
any
purpose
under
any
circumstances
and
that’s
the
case
you're
putting
to
this
court
now?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
so,
then
all
the
discussion
about
communication
is
really
irrelevant
to
the
issue,
isn’t
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
would
you
--
i'm
not
sure
i
understand
just
what
you
mean
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
mr.
ruggiero
about
selectively
germane.
would
you
consider
a
list
of
20
names,
surnames
of
people
and
the
list
of
20
words
selectively
germane?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
he
signed
gambling
slip,
that’s
what
this
whole
thing
is
about,
isn’t
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
this
one?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
then
signing
of
invoices
and
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
signing
of
invoices
and
related
documents?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
about
if
they
went
to
the
bank
and
subpoenaed
all
his
records
and
used
the
handwriting
there?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
you
say,
they
could
do
that?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
notwithstanding
the
fact
that
the
man’s
bank
records
are
something
in
the
nature
of
personal
effects,
are
they
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
even
if
they
take
the
government
to
the
same
place
in
the
long
run,
you
think
that
difference
is
important?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
if
instead
of
supplying
an
affidavit,
a
witness
that
appeared
before
the
grand
jury,
just
in
advance
of
calling
your
client
and
that
the
same
information
was
submitted
to
the
grand
jury,
not
in
writing
but
by
of
oral
testimony?
would
think
you
are
entitled
to
have
a
transcript
to
that
oral
testimony
before
you
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
adhere?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
then
what's
the
difference?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
why
do
you
--
would
you
suggest
why
that
becomes
crucial?
it
is
a
difference
obviously
but
now
why
is
the
difference
crucial?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
ruggiero,
you
are
now
impinging
on
mrs.
bamberger’s
time.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mrs.
bamberger.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
you
take
the
same
position
with
respect
to
fingerprints,
mrs.
bamberger?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we’ll
pick
up
at
that
point
after
lunch,
mrs.
bamberger.
[luncheon
recess]
mrs.
bamberger
you
may
continue.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
how
do
you
know
that
in
the
grand
jury
proceeding
until
you've
finished?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
isn’t
it
quite
different
from
the
trial
of
the
case,
the
relevancy
factor?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
you
are
putting
to
that
court,
it
leaves
the
problem
of
trying
to
determine
the
relevancy
when
perhaps
the
district
judge
would
not
be
competent
to
determine
relevancy
to
a
grand
jury
proceeding
concerning
which
is
not
fully
advised?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
advise
them
ex-parte
in
camera?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mrs.
bamberger.
mr.
lacovara,
do
you
have
anything
further?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
frankly
none,
thank
you.
the
case
is
