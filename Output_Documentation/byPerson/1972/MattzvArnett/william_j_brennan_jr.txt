william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
on
that
map
is
that
what
this
yellow
and
red?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
incidentally
mr.
sclar,
on
this
map
how
much
is
involved
in
this
lawsuit?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that’s
all?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
what’s
this?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that’s
not
an
evidence,
no.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
was
that
on
rehearing?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
was
that
on
rehearing
or
what?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
before
you
get
to
that,
what
do
you
mean
when
he
says
there
is
an
indian
reservation
within
20
miles
of
the
river?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
located
in
one
on
this?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
what
language
of
the
1892
act
do
you
rely
on
as
saying
that
congress
really
meant
to
discontinue
the
reservation
status
which
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
mean
by
that
even
though
perhaps
in
ancient
times,
all
they
can
do
is
a
little
hand
net
to
catch
a
fish
at
the
time?
how
they
could
use
something
that
strikes
across
the
whole
river
and
under
new
technology
and
take
every
fish
in
the
river?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
california
can’t
do
anything
about
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
going
go
back
in
worcester
versus
georgia,
doesn’t
it
state
there’s
no
jurisdiction
to
regulatory
jurisdiction
inside
a
reservation?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
all
right,
thanks
very
much.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
it
certainly
does
look
to
be
bad
at
all.
i
have
seen
it
many
times.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
walston,
may
i
get
back
to
the
statute
for
a
moment.
i
gather
you
are
arguing
that
it’s
quite
consistent
to
read
the
1892
act
as
discontinuing
the
preservation.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
although
that
act
in
terms
provides
that
indians
held
may
have
allotments
on
the
reservation.
is
that
consistent?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
oh!
it
says
that
indian
now
located
upon
said
reservation?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
may
it
anytime
within
one
year
and
so
forth?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
how
can
you
allot
lands
to
indians
unless
it’s
a
reservation?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
do
you
have
to
rely
on
the
1892
act
as
in
fact
discontinuing
this
reservation?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
are
there
private
commercial
fishing?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
