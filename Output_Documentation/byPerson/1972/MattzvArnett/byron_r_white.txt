justice
byron
r.
white
then
you
would
think
to
think
that
even
if
some
would
want
it,
some
was
homesteaded
and
the
people
and
all
the
restriction
on
the
allotments
have
expired
in
allotted
land
dispensable
to
what?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
let
me
ask
you,
can
an
indian
reservation
that’s
along
the
river
belong
to
the
base
bed
of
the
river?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that
has
never
been
allotted
to
anybody?
justice
byron
r.
white
whether
that
reservation
exists
or
whether
it
doesn’t,
and
respect
in
regards
of
who
owns
the
river
bed,
is
there
some
treaty
or
some
law
that
claiming
indian
fishing
right?
or
is
it
just
ancestral
fishing
right?
justice
byron
r.
white
with
what?
justice
byron
r.
white
now
what
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
think
that
you
would
be
saying
that
i
suppose,
since
the
indians
owned
then
and
still
owned
the
bed
of
the
river
that
even
if
all
the
carrying
land
was
in
other
foreign
ship?
the
indians
would
have
the
exclusive
right
to
fish
in
the
river?
justice
byron
r.
white
would
they
have
whole
land
because
there
are
some
river
referring
land
its
own,
but
in
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
this
issue
let
me
say
this,
we
have
--
the
issue
was
not
argued
below
as
to
exactly
what
the
consequences
of
this
being
held
to
be
an
indian
reservation
would
be
the
court
went
off
on
the
question
that
it
was
not
a
reservation.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
for
the
indian
right
and
whether
or
not
the
kind
of
fishing
the
indian
town
would
do,
is
the
kind
of
a
fishing
right
that
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
totally
exercised
has
not
been
settled.
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
that
it
may
be
irrelevant
whether
the
reservation
existed
or
not
if
it’s
true
that
the
indians
still
own
the
bed
of
the
river?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
--
but
the
purpose
for
which
it’s
offered
to
this
court,
you
don’t
object?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
show
where
something
is?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
concede
that
the
tribe
owns
the
bed
of
this
river
in
the
area
that
was
issued
here?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
it
inapplicable,
is
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
normally,
that
state
would
have
an
admission
would
have
taken
side
of
the
river
bank?
justice
byron
r.
white
will
it
make
any
difference
for
the
resolution
of
this
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
means
whatever
it
is
reasonable
to
decide
here
might
not
decide
the
case
at
all.
justice
byron
r.
white
that’s
a
later
case
below
what
part
of
the
arkansas?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
is
your
understanding
of
the
source
as
the
indian
fishing
rights
whether
there’s
a
reservation
--
justice
byron
r.
white
is
it
under
your
fact
that
there
being
a
reservation
is
the
source
of
that
rights
that
no
one
here
points
to
any
particular
treaty
or
any
particular
agreement
with
the
federal
government?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
mean,
the
--
there
must
be
some
substance
in
the
indian’s
claim
of
fishing
right
or
we
wouldn’t
be
here
--
justice
byron
r.
white
if
there
is
a
reservation
present
here,
do
you
concede
that
the
indians
have
a
right
that
the
state
of
california
may
not
regulate
or
interfere
with?
justice
byron
r.
white
why
do
you
concede
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
where
do
you
concede
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
are
the
indians
in
this
case
fishing
with
--
what
kind
of
equipment
that
they
use?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
are
they?
justice
byron
r.
white
how
do
they
get
them
in
the
river?
justice
byron
r.
white
how
do
you
get
the
net
in
the
river?
do
you
need
equipment
to
get
it
in
the
river?
justice
byron
r.
white
how
big
is
it
--
how
big
is
a
gill-net?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
it
used
–
can
it
be
used
as
a
commercial
fishing
--
justice
byron
r.
white
is
that
what
is
being
used
for
here?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
don’t
you
think
that
make
some
difference
in
terms
of
whether
or
not
the
indians
have
fishing
right
that
you
can
interfere
with
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
this
were
[voice
overlap]
where
is
the
law
that
you
find
it
--
where
do
you
find
any
law
like
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
think
just
even
--
even
if
the
state
owns
the
bed
of
the
river?
justice
byron
r.
white
how
do
you
know
of
--
can
i
ask
you,
do
you
know
whether
this
river
is
navigable
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
what
do
you
mean
historically?
justice
byron
r.
white
what’s
the
authority
for
that,
counsel?
justice
byron
r.
white
does
that
includes
commercial
fishing
rights?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
it’s
not
a
commercial
fishing,
what
is
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
with
the
gill
net?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
i
have
read
it.
justice
byron

then
you
would
