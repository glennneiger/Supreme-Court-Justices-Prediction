mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
okay
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
just
received
the
government’s
ac
brief
in
this
case
last
friday
and
their
brief
prompted
me
to
try
to
locate
some
additional
information
which
i
succeeded
in
doing.
i
am
going
to
refer
to
this
information
during
the
course
of
my
oral
argument
and
it
may
well
be
that
the
court
would
like
me
to
also
cite
the
sources
where
this
information
can
be
located.
now,
i
will
be
happy
to
do
that,
but
at
the
same
time,
it
might
be
more
convenient
for
this
court
if
i
am
permitted
to
file
a
very
short
brief
after
this
argument
is
concluded
setting
forth
this
additional
sources
of
information.
i
leave
it
to
the
court
to
decide
that
that
question
and
i’ll
happily
comply
with
whichever
matter
of
the
court
wishes.
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
okay,
fine,
thank
you.
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
none,
your
honor.
the
--
we
offered
those
maps
merely
to
show
that
the
reservation
status
of
the
klamath
river
reservation
is
unsettled
at
the
present
time.
but,
i
don’t
think
that
those
--
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
that’s
probably
true
with
respect
to
most
maps
justice
rehnquist,
but
one
of
the
maps
that
we
referred
to,
in
1909,
map
was
contained
in
a
the
presidential
proclamation
which
is
published
in
the
official
governmental
reports,
and
i
think
that
map
can
be
referred
to
as
an
official
federal
document.
the
other
maps
where
simply
geologic
survey
maps
that
i
simply
located
by
my
own
means
and
i
would
agree
that
those
are
not
properly
before
the
court.
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
that’s
a
map
that
was
offered
by
mr.
sclar
for
illustrative
purposes
only.
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
i
don’t
object,
no.
it’s
merely
illustrative
that
shows
--
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
yes,
that’s
correct
your
honor.
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
yes,
that’s
correct
your
honor
because
that’s
contained
in
the
senate
documents
and
i
cited
the
appropriate
citation
in
my
opening
brief
to
this
court.
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
we
haven’t
raised
that
question
justice
white.
there
is
a
question
in
the
case
as
to
whether
the
indians
actually
own
the
bed
of
the
river.
the
solicitor
general
responded
to
your
question
yesterday
by
saying
that
the
donnelly
court
had
decided
that
question.
i
recall
from
my
own
recollection,
however
that
the
donnelly
court
itself
later
reversed
its
own
finding
on
that
question
and
left
the
matter
up
in
the
air,
and
i
would
refer
the
court
to
page
711
of
the
same
volume
of
the
united
states
reports
in
which
the
donnelly
decision
is
reported,
page
75.
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
pardon
me?
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
that
was
a
--
yes,
it
was
tantamount
to
rehearing.
it
simply
retracted
its
earlier
holding
and
left
unsettled
the
very
question
of
whether
the
indians
own
title
to
the
bed
or
not.
we
consider
--
i
consider
that
--
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
i
believe
that
the
river
is
inapplicable
and
that
--
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
that’s
correct,
your
honor.
in
fact,
i
was
prepared
to
submit
an
argument
to
that
effect
to
the
court
but
i
didn’t
because
i
felt
that
there
were
sufficient
other
grounds
to
dispose
of
the
case.
so,
i
didn’t
want
to
raise
what
i
consider
to
be
a
technical
argument.
based
on
your
question
yesterday,
i
--
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
yes,
it
might.
if
the
indians
--
if
the
reservation
includes
all
of
the
area
--
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
that’s
possible
if
the
court
concludes
that
the
river
that
runs
to
the
old
reservation
is
not
part
of
the
reservation
itself
and
the
title
to
that
river
is
vested
in
the
state
of
california,
then
this
question
is
not
before
the
court.
i
should
caution
you
justice
white
that
in
arizona
versus
californian
which
is
decided
a
few
years
ago
by
this
court,
there
are
some
language
in
the
later
part
of
that
opinion
that
question
--
that
seemed
to
indicate
that
a
river
running
through
an
indian
reservation
is
considered
part
of
the
reservation.
and
because
of
that
language,
i
didn’t
raise
the
argument
in
this
case.
i’ll
be
very
happy
to
submit
a
--
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
sir,
i
am
aware
of
that
your
honor.
anyway,
i
think
that
justice
white’s
observation
about
the
title
of
this
area
might
well
justify
this
court
in
disposing
this
case
on
other
grounds,
but
if
the
court
wishes
to
dispose
of
the
case
on
the
grounds
that
have
been
raised
by
the
parties
in
this
case
that
were
considered
by
the
trial
court,
i
would
respectfully
submit
that
the
key
question
before
this
court
at
the
present
time
is
in
determining
the
intent,
the
legislative
intent
behind
the
1892
act
that
was
passed
by
congress.
now,
that’s
the
act
before
this
court.
that’s
the
act
that
effectively
restored
all
of
the
lands
on
the
old
klamath
river
reservation
to
homestead
settlement
and
provide
for
individual
trust
allotments
to
the
indians
with
respect
to
those
lands.
now,
the
solicitor
general
in
its
ac
brief
has
made
the
contention
that
this
is
merely
one
of
many
examples
of
legislative
action
in
which
congress
attempted
to
utilize
the
old
general
allotment
act
for
the
purpose
of
training
over
trust
allotments
to
the
indians.
the
general
allotment
act
basically
provided
that
with
respect
to
a
large
reservation
area,
any
lands
which
are
not
being
used
by
the
indians
and
which
are
surplus
to
their
needs
can
be
sold
to
homesteaders
who
want
to
receive
the
lands
and
that
the
proceeds
from
the
sale
can
then
go
back
into
the
reservation’s
operating
funds,
so
as
to
augment
the
operating
capital
of
reservation.
and
this
court
has
held
on
many
occasions
that
it
was
not
the
intent
or
the
purpose
of
the
general
allotment
act
determining
an
indian
reservation,
and
we
have
no
quarrel
with
that
proposition.
but
the
government’s
argument
in
trying
to
tie
this
case
and
with
the
purpose
and
spirit
of
the
general
allotment
act
really
ignores
the
very
unique
historical
context
surrounding
the
klamath
river
reservation
which
is
before
this
court.
the
government’s
argument
raises
--
ignores
the
unusual
historical
circumstances
that
led
congress
in
1892
that
passed
the
act
in
question.
now,
i’d
like
to
refer
specifically
what
i
consider
to
be
the
two
main
historical
factors
considered
by
congress
in
passing
the
1892
act.
first,
this
is
i
think
foremost
the
indians
by
the
time
the
1892
act
was
passed
have
largely
abandoned
the
reservation.
they
were
no
longer
there
for
all
practical
purposes.
if
you
refer
to
decision
in
united
states
versus
forty-eight
pounds
of
rising
star
tea
cited
by
both
parties
in
this
case,
you’ll
see
that
when
the
reservation
was
originally
created
in
1855,
there
were
2,500
indians
on
the
reservation.
but
by
the
time
the
case
was
decided
in
1888,
there
were
only
200
indians
left.
and
then
if
you
look
at
the
congressional
reports
which
are
cited
at
length
in
my
opening
brief,
you’ll
find
that
congress
estimated
that
the
number
of
indians
left
on
the
reservation
at
that
time
was
40
to
60.
i
have
also
located
an
1892
census
conducted
by
the
commissioner
of
indian
affairs
in
which
he
found
that
they
where
only
30
--
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
everything
i
said
so
far
has
been
your
honor.
i
now
--
when
i
refer
to
1892
census
i
am
refer
you
something
that
i
found
in
the
annual
reports
of
the
commission
of
indian
affairs
to
the
secretary
of
interior
for
the
year
1893.
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
yes.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
yes,
the
40
to
60
figure,
and
that’s
contained
in
the
statements
of
the
bills,
authors
or
the
bill’s
author
or
i
should
say
spokesman
in
the
senate
at
23
congressional
record
3918.
he
specifically
said
that
they
where
40
to
60
indians
left
on
the
old
reservation
at
that
time.
an
1892
census
conducted
by
the
commissioner
of
indian
affairs
apparently
only
located
30
indians
remaining
on
the
old
klamath
river
reservation.
and
this
is
reported
--
this
back
i
piece
together
from
two
different
sources
of
information.
first,
the
census
actually
found
505
indians
total
on
both
the
klamath
river
reservation
and
the
area
20
miles
upstream
from
the
klamath
river
reservation
which
everybody
refers
to
as
the
connecting
strip,
and
that
fact
is
reported
in
annual
report
of
commissioner
of
indian
affairs
to
secretary
of
interior
year
1892,
page
784.
then,
according
to
the
trial
commissioner’s
findings
in
the
short
case
which
had
been
heavily
relied
upon
by
both
the
commissioner
and
the
united
states
in
this
case
at
page
55,
it
was
stated
the
475
of
this
indians
were
located
on
the
upstream
area,
and
thus
out
of
the
klamath
river
reservation
that
leaves
only
30
indians
left
on
the
old
reservation.
so
that
means
from
a
practical
purposes
that
more
than
95%
of
the
indians
on
the
klamath
river
reservation
lift
the
reservation
between
the
time
that
it
was
originally
created
in
1855,
and
the
time
that
the
1892
act
was
before
congress,
and
that
is
the
first
historical
fact
that
i
think
has
some
significance
in
this
case.
secondly,
after
the
indians
move
out
of
the
area,
the
homesteaders
moved
into
the
area.
and
according
to
the
congressional
debates
which
as
i
say
had
been
quoted
at
length
in
my
opening
brief,
most
of
the
lands
in
the
old
reservation
area
where
then
taken
over
by
the
homesteaders,
and
they
occupy
this
area.
they
lived
on
the
--
they
took
over
the
arable
lands
that
were
located
along
rivers
banks.
so,
we
have
the
indians
basically
leaving
the
area
and
the
white
settlers
moving
into
the
area.
and
many
bills
were
offered
in
the
congress
through
the
1818’s
for
the
purpose
of
perfecting
the
title
of
these
homesteaders
to
the
lands
which
they
occupied.
the
1892
act
was
a
direct
outgrowth
of
all
these
congressional
efforts.
this
is
the
historical
context
that
i
am
referring
to
and
that
i
think
distinguishes
this
case
from
the
seymour
case
and
that
also
distinguishes
this
case
from
the
typical
type
of
case
in
which
congress
utilize
the
general
allotment
act
for
the
purpose
of
distributing
surplus
lands
to
homesteaders
for
the
indian’s
benefits.
now,
congress
was
very
greatly
persuaded
and
influenced
by
these
historical
circumstances
to
which
i’ve
alluded
is
very
unique
historical
circumstances.
in
fact,
if
you
look
at
the
house
report
connected
with
hr
38
which
is
the
bill
that
eventually
became
the
act,
you
find
the
following
statements.
this
reservation,
the
klamath
river
reservation,
and
this
is
congress
speaking.
this
reservation
became
abandoned
in
law
as
it
has
been
in
fact
since
the
winter
of
1861-1862.
and
the
bill
went
on
into
congress
and
the
bill
was
reported
on
the
floor
of
the
congress
by
representative
gary.
and
during
the
course
of
his
discussion
and
his
oral
presentation
to
congress,
he
said
as
follows.
in
1861,
the
reservation
was
abandoned
and
has
never
been
since
used
for
that
purpose.
since
1868,
it
has
been
occupied
by
settlers.
then
after
the
bill
passed
the
house,
it
went
into
the
senate.
there
the
bill
was
amended
to
provide
for
trust
allotments
to
the
indians.
the
petitioner
raymond
mattz
claimed
that
this
trust
allotment
amendment
somehow
very
basically
altered
the
nature
of
the
bill,
and
yet,
the
bill
spokesman
in
the
senate
said
the
same
thing
and
virtually
the
same
language
that
was
said
in
the
house
report
and
by
the
bill
spokesman
in
the
house,
and
let’s
hear
the
senator
who
spoke.
he
said,
the
klamath
river
reservation
has
never
been
used
as
an
indian
reservation.
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
this
is
on
page
7
of
my
opening
brief
your
honor
which
is
the
blue
brief.
the
klamath
river
reservation
never
has
been
used
as
an
indian
reservation.
the
number
of
indians
located
on
the
reservation
--
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
he
is
referring
there
your
honor
to
the
hoopa
valley
reservation
which
is
the
large
12
mile
by
12
mile
square
reservation
as
located
--
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
yes,
i
believe
it’s
the
green
block
on
the
map.
the
number
of
indians
located
on
this
land
is
various
--
on
the
reservation
is
very
is
variously
estimated
up
from
40
to
60
indians.
quoting
again,
“there
are
great
many
settlers
upon
this
land.
it
is
not
practically
an
indian
reservation.
it
never
has
been
used
for
that
purpose.”
so,
that’s
congress
speaking.
that’s
what
congress
had
in
mind
and
it’s
quite
clear
from
his
language,
this
congressional
language
that
congress
did
not
regard
this
as
a
fact
a
reservation
in
1892.
it
did
not
consider
that
this
area
was
actually
operating
for
the
purposes
for
which
reservations
normally
operate.
it
clearly
indicated
that
after
the
1892
act
was
passed
that
the
reservation
was
not
intended
to
survive
the
act.
that’s
the
clear
and
only
meaning
that
can
be
attributed
to
this
congressional
language.
these
assurances
by
the
bill
spokesman
where
apparently
very
important
in
securing
the
passage
of
the
bill,
and
it
must
have
been
the
congress
that
the
spokesman
assumed
and
the
congress
assumed
that
they
where
not
going
to
open
a
large
reservation
for
homestead
entry
and
settlement
if
they
wanted
the
area
to
continue
to
function
as
an
indian
reservation.
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
well,
at
this
point
your
honor,
i
am
referring
more
to
the
congressional
intent
behind
the
act.
the
language
of
the
act
itself
merely
provides
for
entry
and
settlement
to
homesteaders
and
it
also
provides
for
trust
allotments
to
the
indians,
and
then
in
the
first
sentence
--
i
believe,
it’s
the
first
sentence
of
the
act,
the
1892
act
specifically
refers
in
the
past
tense,
rather
than
the
present
tense
to
the
klamath
river
reservation.
it
says
i
believe,
it
refers
i
believe
to
both
lands
and
what
was
the
klamath
river
reservation.
now,
the
petitioner
has
pointed
out
that
that
language,
the
use
of
that
past
tense
is
subject
to
many
conflicting
inferences.
and
if
they
where
no
congressional
history
before
this
court,
i
would
strongly
agree
with
there
could
be
conflicting
inferences.
but
with
the
congressional
and
statements
that
were
--
that
are
made
on
the
floor
of
congress,
it’s
quite
apparent
that
this
reference
in
the
past
tense
is
quite
consistent
with
the
statements
which
were
made
by
the
bill
spokesman
in
both
the
house
and
the
senate,
and
thus
indicates
that
congress
simply
did
not
intent
for
the
area
to
continue
as
a
reservation.
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
it’s
precisely
correct.
that’s
precisely
correct.
the
effect
of
situation
itself
did
not
end
the
reservation,
but
that
effect
of
situation
coupled
with
congress’
statements
concerning
the
purposes
of
the
1892
act
do
point
in
that
direction.
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
my
understanding
that
if
the
area
is
a
reservation,
they
are
allowed
to
fish
without
restriction
on
the
reservation.
if
the
area
is
not
a
reservation,
then
they
are
not
allowed
to
fish
without
restriction
--
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
that’s
absolutely
correct,
your
honor.
that
question
is
not
before
the
court
here.
that
question,
it
was
not
considered
by
the
trial
court.
the
trial
court
held
only
that
the
area
wasn’t
a
reservation.
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
well,
the
indians
--
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
yes,
that’s
correct
your
honor.
we
concede
that.
but,
i’d
like
to
point
out
your
honor,
but
with
california
--
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
pardon
me?
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
that
if
the
area
is
a
reservation,
we’re
not
allowed?
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
well,
i
frankly
i
don’t
recall
your
honor.
that’s
one
of
the
questions
that
i
may
have
occurred
to
me
at
some
already
point
in
the
case
and
that
i
simply
--
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
they
are
using
gill-nets,
your
honor.
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
these
are
large,
very
large
mesh
nets
that
catch
the
fish
as
they
go
--
as
they
swim
through
the
nets
by
the
gills
so
that
the
fish
cannot
return.
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
i
--
are
you
asking
whether
there
is
one
or
more
or
multiple
--
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
no,
this
can
be
hand
held.
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
it
varies.
a
gill-net
can
vary
from
a
very
--
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
yes,
yes,
it
commonly
yes.
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
in
the
precise
question
before
the
court,
we
do
not
know
the
answer
to
that
question.
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
i
am
not
sure,
your
honor.
i
would
think
that
if
the
indians
have
the
right
to
fish
on
the
reservation
for
the
wrong
purposes,
they’d
also
have
the
right
to
fish
on
the
reservation
for
commercial
purposes.
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
that’s
my
understanding.
now
if
--
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
and
california
can’t
do
a
thing
about
it.
now,
the
bia,
if
this
--
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
you
got
me
on
that
question,
your
honor.
i
can
probably
research
the
questions
and
submit
an
answer.
i
just
don’t
recall
frankly
the
source
of
the
proposition.
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
i
think
that’s
right
your
honor.
i
think
that’s
the
source
of
authority.
i
located
this
long
ago
mr.
justice
white
and
i
just
frankly
don’t
recall
my
--
the
source
of
that
information.
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
if
the
state
owns
the
bed
of
the
river
the
indians
can’t
fish
without
restriction
on
the
river
and
california
can
regulate
--
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
it’s
my
understanding
that
the
river
isn’t
navigable.
and
i
think
that
this
was
covered
in
donnelly
decision
at
page
711,
i
am
not
sure
--
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
this
goes
back
sometime
in
my
thinking
your
honor.
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
no,
i
think
that’s
correct
and
i
think
that’s
why
the
donnelly
court
originally
concluded
that
the
river
was
not
navigable
and
then
later,
it
found
that
california
had
some
special
legislation
concerning
your
question
of
navigability,
and
thus,
the
donnelly
court
changed
its
mind.
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
yes,
that’s
correct.
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
well
--
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
yes.
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
that’s
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
no,
you
are
absolutely
correct.
in
other
words,
if
the
area
is
a
reservation,
there
is
a
basis
for
california
still
regulating
the
fishing
on
the
area
if
there
was
no
federal
treaty,
agreement
or
statute.
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
right.
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
yes,
that’s
correct
your
honor.
that’s
absolutely
correct.
it’s
interesting
--
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
yes.
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
there
is
a
single
reference
in
the
1892
act
to
the
word
reservation
--
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
yes.
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
yes.
if
you
look
at
the
word
said
reservation
your
honor,
you
will
see
that
it
is
a
reference
back
to
the
statement
and
i
believe
it
is
prior
of
sentence
to
“land
--
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
oh!
this
is
done
quite
commonly,
your
honor.
this
was
done
in
the
--
with
respect
to
the
north
half
of
the
colville
reservation
in
1892
which
involved
an
act
that
was
passed
about
two
weeks
before
the
1892
act
before
this
court.
and
in
that
case,
congress
discontinued
the
north
half
of
the
colville
reservation,
and
yet
made
the
number
of
indian
allotments
on
the
old
existent
--
on
the
former
reservation.
and
this
court
held
in
both
united
states
versus
pelican
and
the
in
the
seymour
case
that
the
old
north
half
of
the
colville
reservation
was
terminated,
and
yet
that
individual
trust
allotments
of
indians
were
still
situated
on
the
old
area.
so
in
effect,
they
have
created
of
course
federal
enclave
type
situation.
the
court
has
expressed
i
think
some
concern
--
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
yes,
that’s
correct,
your
honor.
the
court
has
expressed
some
concern
about
the
type
of
regulation.
i
think
that
california
is
providing
with
respect
to
yurok
fishing
activity
in
the
klamath’s
river.
and
i
want
to
remind
the
court
that
the
section
7155
of
california
fish
and
game
code
is
the
code
section
under
which
we
regulate
yurok
fishing
activity
in
the
klamath’s
river.
incidentally,
i
made
an
error
in
my
opening
brief.
i
said
that
the
--
that
that
section
was
enacted
in
1957.
actually,
it
was
enacted
in
1951
and
it
was
re-codified
in
1957.
that
means
that
for
22
years,
nearly
a
quarter
of
a
century,
california
has
been
regulating
yurok
fishing
activity
in
the
klamath
river,
and
nobody
has
objected.
the
bia
has
not
objected.
they
never
offered
and
they
never
brought
any
lawsuit
against
the
state
the
california
with
respect
to
this
regulation.
now,
this
regulation
i
think
clearly
recognizes
the
very
special
circumstances
that
the
yurok
indians
find
themselves
in.
we
recognized
that
the
yuroks
are
in
impoverish
tribe
and
that
they
have
special
economic
and
social
needs,
and
that
they
do
deserve
some
special
consideration
under
california’s
fish
and
game
code
structure,
and
with
provided
this
type
of
protection
for
them
in
section
7155,
because
we’ve
immunized
them
from
many
of
the
restrictions
which
are
imposed
on
none
--
on
non-indians
on
whites
who
fish
in
the
same
river.
for
instance,
whites
who
fish
in
the
river
have
to
--
can
only
fish
can
only
fish
during
certain
seasons
of
the
year.
indians
can
fish
at
any
time
of
the
year
for
--
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
no,
your
honor.
under
the
code
section,
they
are
not
permitted
to
fish
and
catch
the
fish
and
then
sell
the
fish.
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
subsistence
purposes
only.
that’s
correct
your
honor.
and
also,
the
indians
are
not
subject
to
daily
bag
limits.
in
other
words,
they
can
simply
take
as
many
fish
as
they
want
from
the
river
each
day,
except
for
three
very
critical
types
of
fish,
the
sturgeon,
the
salmon
and
the
trout.
but
the
white
man
who
fishes
in
that
river
is
subject
to
daily
bag
limits
with
respect
to
every
type
of
fish.
so,
california
has
recognized
for
nearly
a
quarter
of
a
century
that
the
indians,
that
the
yurok
indians
fishing
in
that
area
has
special
problems
and
that
they
have
a
special
dependency
on
this
fishery,
unless
that
they
should
be
given
some
type
of
special
consideration.
but
at
the
same
time,
i
think
we
are
highly
cognizant
in
california
that
needs
of
the
fishery
itself,
it
needs
to
be
protected.
it
can’t
sustain
an
unending
yield
forever.
the
fish
and
game
officials
in
california
feel
very
strongly
that
if
the
yuroks
are
allowed
to
fish
without
restriction
in
this
area,
the
fishery
might
and
probably
very
will
be
irreparably
damage.
so,
in
california,
we
try
to
reconcile
these
two
competing
needs,
the
needs
of
the
indians,
the
needs
of
the
fishery
itself
and
we’ve
come
up
with
section
7155
which
has
worked
for
nearly
a
quarter
of
a
century
and
we
--
i
respectfully
ask
this
court
to
uphold
the
decision
of
the
california
court
of
appeals
and
allow
california
to
go
on
trying
to
work
--
working
this
question
out
on
an
ad
hoc
basis.
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
mr.
chief
justice,
may
i
add
one
additional
minute?
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
it’s
in
rebuttal
to
something,
your
honor.
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
just
one
fact
that
i
like
to
point
out
to
the
court’s
attention.
counsel
said
that
approximately
40%
of
the
old
klamath
river
reservation
was
taken
over
by
the
indians
after
the
1892
act
was
passed.
i
would
refer
the
court
to
the
annual
reports
of
the
commissioner
of
indian
affairs
to
the
secretary
of
interior
for
the
years
1895
through
1900.
for
example,
the
1895
report
at
page
582,
and
that
shows
that
the
total
acreage
cultivated
by
indians
on
both
the
klamath
river
reservation
and
the
upstream
20
miles
area
together
was
only
400
acres,
and
that
figure
reappears
in
each
annual
report
of
the
commissioner
from
1895
to
1900.
and
that
shows
that
the
klamath
river
reservation
--
that
the
indians
on
old
klamath
river
reservation
were
actually
cultivating
less
than
400
acres
on
the
old
reservation,
which
of
course
is
less
than
one
square
mile.
thank
you.
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
okay
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
just
received
the
government’s
ac
brief
in
this
case
last
friday
and
their
brief
prompted
me
to
try
to
locate
some
additional
information
which
i
succeeded
in
doing.
i
am
going
to
refer
to
this
information
during
the
course
of
my
oral
argument
and
it
may
well
be
that
the
court
would
like
me
to
also
cite
the
sources
where
this
information
can
be
located.
now,
i
will
be
happy
to
do
that,
but
at
the
same
time,
it
might
be
more
convenient
for
this
court
if
i
am
permitted
to
file
a
very
short
brief
after
this
argument
is
concluded
setting
forth
this
additional
sources
of
information.
i
leave
it
to
the
court
to
decide
that
that
question
and
i’ll
happily
comply
with
whichever
matter
of
the
court
wishes.
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
okay,
fine,
thank
you.
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
none,
your
honor.
the
--
we
offered
those
maps
merely
to
show
that
the
reservation
status
of
the
klamath
river
reservation
is
unsettled
at
the
present
time.
but,
i
don’t
think
that
those
--
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
that’s
probably
true
with
respect
to
most
maps
justice
rehnquist,
but
one
of
the
maps
that
we
referred
to,
in
1909,
map
was
contained
in
a
the
presidential
proclamation
which
is
published
in
the
official
governmental
reports,
and
i
think
that
map
can
be
referred
to
as
an
official
federal
document.
the
other
maps
where
simply
geologic
survey
maps
that
i
simply
located
by
my
own
means
and
i
would
agree
that
those
are
not
properly
before
the
court.
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
that’s
a
map
that
was
offered
by
mr.
sclar
for
illustrative
purposes
only.
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
i
don’t
object,
no.
it’s
merely
illustrative
that
shows
--
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
yes,
that’s
correct
your
honor.
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
yes,
that’s
correct
your
honor
because
that’s
contained
in
the
senate
documents
and
i
cited
the
appropriate
citation
in
my
opening
brief
to
this
court.
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
we
haven’t
raised
that
question
justice
white.
there
is
a
question
in
the
case
as
to
whether
the
indians
actually
own
the
bed
of
the
river.
the
solicitor
general
responded
to
your
question
yesterday
by
saying
that
the
donnelly
court
had
decided
that
question.
i
recall
from
my
own
recollection,
however
that
the
donnelly
court
itself
later
reversed
its
own
finding
on
that
question
and
left
the
matter
up
in
the
air,
and
i
would
refer
the
court
to
page
711
of
the
same
volume
of
the
united
states
reports
in
which
the
donnelly
decision
is
reported,
page
75.
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
pardon
me?
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
that
was
a
--
yes,
it
was
tantamount
to
rehearing.
it
simply
retracted
its
earlier
holding
and
left
unsettled
the
very
question
of
whether
the
indians
own
title
to
the
bed
or
not.
we
consider
--
i
consider
that
--
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
i
believe
that
the
river
is
inapplicable
and
that
--
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
that’s
correct,
your
honor.
in
fact,
i
was
prepared
to
submit
an
argument
to
that
effect
to
the
court
but
i
didn’t
because
i
felt
that
there
were
sufficient
other
grounds
to
dispose
of
the
case.
so,
i
didn’t
want
to
raise
what
i
consider
to
be
a
technical
argument.
based
on
your
question
yesterday,
i
--
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
yes,
it
might.
if
the
indians
--
if
the
reservation
includes
all
of
the
area
--
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
that’s
possible
if
the
court
concludes
that
the
river
that
runs
to
the
old
reservation
is
not
part
of
the
reservation
itself
and
the
title
to
that
river
is
vested
in
the
state
of
california,
then
this
question
is
not
before
the
court.
i
should
caution
you
justice
white
that
in
arizona
versus
californian
which
is
decided
a
few
years
ago
by
this
court,
there
are
some
language
in
the
later
part
of
that
opinion
that
question
--
that
seemed
to
indicate
that
a
river
running
through
an
indian
reservation
is
considered
part
of
the
reservation.
and
because
of
that
language,
i
didn’t
raise
the
argument
in
this
case.
i’ll
be
very
happy
to
submit
a
--
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
sir,
i
am
aware
of
that
your
honor.
anyway,
i
think
that
justice
white’s
observation
about
the
title
of
this
area
might
well
justify
this
court
in
disposing
this
case
on
other
grounds,
but
if
the
court
wishes
to
dispose
of
the
case
on
the
grounds
that
have
been
raised
by
the
parties
in
this
case
that
were
considered
by
the
trial
court,
i
would
respectfully
submit
that
the
key
question
before
this
court
at
the
present
time
is
in
determining
the
intent,
the
legislative
intent
behind
the
1892
act
that
was
passed
by
congress.
now,
that’s
the
act
before
this
court.
that’s
the
act
that
effectively
restored
all
of
the
lands
on
the
old
klamath
river
reservation
to
homestead
settlement
and
provide
for
individual
trust
allotments
to
the
indians
with
respect
to
those
lands.
now,
the
solicitor
general
in
its
ac
brief
has
made
the
contention
that
this
is
merely
one
of
many
examples
of
legislative
action
in
which
congress
attempted
to
utilize
the
old
general
allotment
act
for
the
purpose
of
training
over
trust
allotments
to
the
indians.
the
general
allotment
act
basically
provided
that
with
respect
to
a
large
reservation
area,
any
lands
which
are
not
being
used
by
the
indians
and
which
are
surplus
to
their
needs
can
be
sold
to
homesteaders
who
want
to
receive
the
lands
and
that
the
proceeds
from
the
sale
can
then
go
back
into
the
reservation’s
operating
funds,
so
as
to
augment
the
operating
capital
of
reservation.
and
this
court
has
held
on
many
occasions
that
it
was
not
the
intent
or
the
purpose
of
the
general
allotment
act
determining
an
indian
reservation,
and
we
have
no
quarrel
with
that
proposition.
but
the
government’s
argument
in
trying
to
tie
this
case
and
with
the
purpose
and
spirit
of
the
general
allotment
act
really
ignores
the
very
unique
historical
context
surrounding
the
klamath
river
reservation
which
is
before
this
court.
the
government’s
argument
raises
--
ignores
the
unusual
historical
circumstances
that
led
congress
in
1892
that
passed
the
act
in
question.
now,
i’d
like
to
refer
specifically
what
i
consider
to
be
the
two
main
historical
factors
considered
by
congress
in
passing
the
1892
act.
first,
this
is
i
think
foremost
the
indians
by
the
time
the
1892
act
was
passed
have
largely
abandoned
the
reservation.
they
were
no
longer
there
for
all
practical
purposes.
if
you
refer
to
decision
in
united
states
versus
forty-eight
pounds
of
rising
star
tea
cited
by
both
parties
in
this
case,
you’ll
see
that
when
the
reservation
was
originally
created
in
1855,
there
were
2,500
indians
on
the
reservation.
but
by
the
time
the
case
was
decided
in
1888,
there
were
only
200
indians
left.
and
then
if
you
look
at
the
congressional
reports
which
are
cited
at
length
in
my
opening
brief,
you’ll
find
that
congress
estimated
that
the
number
of
indians
left
on
the
reservation
at
that
time
was
40
to
60.
i
have
also
located
an
1892
census
conducted
by
the
commissioner
of
indian
affairs
in
which
he
found
that
they
where
only
30
--
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
everything
i
said
so
far
has
been
your
honor.
i
now
--
when
i
refer
to
1892
census
i
am
refer
you
something
that
i
found
in
the
annual
reports
of
the
commission
of
indian
affairs
to
the
secretary
of
interior
for
the
year
1893.
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
yes.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
yes,
the
40
to
60
figure,
and
that’s
contained
in
the
statements
of
the
bills,
authors
or
the
bill’s
author
or
i
should
say
spokesman
in
the
senate
at
23
congressional
record
3918.
he
specifically
said
that
they
where
40
to
60
indians
left
on
the
old
reservation
at
that
time.
an
1892
census
conducted
by
the
commissioner
of
indian
affairs
apparently
only
located
30
indians
remaining
on
the
old
klamath
river
reservation.
and
this
is
reported
--
this
back
i
piece
together
from
two
different
sources
of
information.
first,
the
census
actually
found
505
indians
total
on
both
the
klamath
river
reservation
and
the
area
20
miles
upstream
from
the
klamath
river
reservation
which
everybody
refers
to
as
the
connecting
strip,
and
that
fact
is
reported
in
annual
report
of
commissioner
of
indian
affairs
to
secretary
of
interior
year
1892,
page
784.
then,
according
to
the
trial
commissioner’s
findings
in
the
short
case
which
had
been
heavily
relied
upon
by
both
the
commissioner
and
the
united
states
in
this
case
at
page
55,
it
was
stated
the
475
of
this
indians
were
located
on
the
upstream
area,
and
thus
out
of
the
klamath
river
reservation
that
leaves
only
30
indians
left
on
the
old
reservation.
so
that
means
from
a
practical
purposes
that
more
than
95%
of
the
indians
on
the
klamath
river
reservation
lift
the
reservation
between
the
time
that
it
was
originally
created
in
1855,
and
the
time
that
the
1892
act
was
before
congress,
and
that
is
the
first
historical
fact
that
i
think
has
some
significance
in
this
case.
secondly,
after
the
indians
move
out
of
the
area,
the
homesteaders
moved
into
the
area.
and
according
to
the
congressional
debates
which
as
i
say
had
been
quoted
at
length
in
my
opening
brief,
most
of
the
lands
in
the
old
reservation
area
where
then
taken
over
by
the
homesteaders,
and
they
occupy
this
area.
they
lived
on
the
--
they
took
over
the
arable
lands
that
were
located
along
rivers
banks.
so,
we
have
the
indians
basically
leaving
the
area
and
the
white
settlers
moving
into
the
area.
and
many
bills
were
offered
in
the
congress
through
the
1818’s
for
the
purpose
of
perfecting
the
title
of
these
homesteaders
to
the
lands
which
they
occupied.
the
1892
act
was
a
direct
outgrowth
of
all
these
congressional
efforts.
this
is
the
historical
context
that
i
am
referring
to
and
that
i
think
distinguishes
this
case
from
the
seymour
case
and
that
also
distinguishes
this
case
from
the
typical
type
of
case
in
which
congress
utilize
the
general
allotment
act
for
the
purpose
of
distributing
surplus
lands
to
homesteaders
for
the
indian’s
benefits.
now,
congress
was
very
greatly
persuaded
and
influenced
by
these
historical
circumstances
to
which
i’ve
alluded
is
very
unique
historical
circumstances.
in
fact,
if
you
look
at
the
house
report
connected
with
hr
38
which
is
the
bill
that
eventually
became
the
act,
you
find
the
following
statements.
this
reservation,
the
klamath
river
reservation,
and
this
is
congress
speaking.
this
reservation
became
abandoned
in
law
as
it
has
been
in
fact
since
the
winter
of
1861-1862.
and
the
bill
went
on
into
congress
and
the
bill
was
reported
on
the
floor
of
the
congress
by
representative
gary.
and
during
the
course
of
his
discussion
and
his
oral
presentation
to
congress,
he
said
as
follows.
in
1861,
the
reservation
was
abandoned
and
has
never
been
since
used
for
that
purpose.
since
1868,
it
has
been
occupied
by
settlers.
then
after
the
bill
passed
the
house,
it
went
into
the
senate.
there
the
bill
was
amended
to
provide
for
trust
allotments
to
the
indians.
the
petitioner
raymond
mattz
claimed
that
this
trust
allotment
amendment
somehow
very
basically
altered
the
nature
of
the
bill,
and
yet,
the
bill
spokesman
in
the
senate
said
the
same
thing
and
virtually
the
same
language
that
was
said
in
the
house
report
and
by
the
bill
spokesman
in
the
house,
and
let’s
hear
the
senator
who
spoke.
he
said,
the
klamath
river
reservation
has
never
been
used
as
an
indian
reservation.
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
this
is
on
page
7
of
my
opening
brief
your
honor
which
is
the
blue
brief.
the
klamath
river
reservation
never
has
been
used
as
an
indian
reservation.
the
number
of
indians
located
on
the
reservation
--
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
he
is
referring
there
your
honor
to
the
hoopa
valley
reservation
which
is
the
large
12
mile
by
12
mile
square
reservation
as
located
--
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
yes,
i
believe
it’s
the
green
block
on
the
map.
the
number
of
indians
located
on
this
land
is
various
--
on
the
reservation
is
very
is
variously
estimated
up
from
40
to
60
indians.
quoting
again,
“there
are
great
many
settlers
upon
this
land.
it
is
not
practically
an
indian
reservation.
it
never
has
been
used
for
that
purpose.”
so,
that’s
congress
speaking.
that’s
what
congress
had
in
mind
and
it’s
quite
clear
from
his
language,
this
congressional
language
that
congress
did
not
regard
this
as
a
fact
a
reservation
in
1892.
it
did
not
consider
that
this
area
was
actually
operating
for
the
purposes
for
which
reservations
normally
operate.
it
clearly
indicated
that
after
the
1892
act
was
passed
that
the
reservation
was
not
intended
to
survive
the
act.
that’s
the
clear
and
only
meaning
that
can
be
attributed
to
this
congressional
language.
these
assurances
by
the
bill
spokesman
where
apparently
very
important
in
securing
the
passage
of
the
bill,
and
it
must
have
been
the
congress
that
the
spokesman
assumed
and
the
congress
assumed
that
they
where
not
going
to
open
a
large
reservation
for
homestead
entry
and
settlement
if
they
wanted
the
area
to
continue
to
function
as
an
indian
reservation.
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
well,
at
this
point
your
honor,
i
am
referring
more
to
the
congressional
intent
behind
the
act.
the
language
of
the
act
itself
merely
provides
for
entry
and
settlement
to
homesteaders
and
it
also
provides
for
trust
allotments
to
the
indians,
and
then
in
the
first
sentence
--
i
believe,
it’s
the
first
sentence
of
the
act,
the
1892
act
specifically
refers
in
the
past
tense,
rather
than
the
present
tense
to
the
klamath
river
reservation.
it
says
i
believe,
it
refers
i
believe
to
both
lands
and
what
was
the
klamath
river
reservation.
now,
the
petitioner
has
pointed
out
that
that
language,
the
use
of
that
past
tense
is
subject
to
many
conflicting
inferences.
and
if
they
where
no
congressional
history
before
this
court,
i
would
strongly
agree
with
there
could
be
conflicting
inferences.
but
with
the
congressional
and
statements
that
were
--
that
are
made
on
the
floor
of
congress,
it’s
quite
apparent
that
this
reference
in
the
past
tense
is
quite
consistent
with
the
statements
which
were
made
by
the
bill
spokesman
in
both
the
house
and
the
senate,
and
thus
indicates
that
congress
simply
did
not
intent
for
the
area
to
continue
as
a
reservation.
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
it’s
precisely
correct.
that’s
precisely
correct.
the
effect
of
situation
itself
did
not
end
the
reservation,
but
that
effect
of
situation
coupled
with
congress’
statements
concerning
the
purposes
of
the
1892
act
do
point
in
that
direction.
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
my
understanding
that
if
the
area
is
a
reservation,
they
are
allowed
to
fish
without
restriction
on
the
reservation.
if
the
area
is
not
a
reservation,
then
they
are
not
allowed
to
fish
without
restriction
--
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
that’s
absolutely
correct,
your
honor.
that
question
is
not
before
the
court
here.
that
question,
it
was
not
considered
by
the
trial
court.
the
trial
court
held
only
that
the
area
wasn’t
a
reservation.
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
well,
the
indians
--
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
yes,
that’s
correct
your
honor.
we
concede
that.
but,
i’d
like
to
point
out
your
honor,
but
with
california
--
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
pardon
me?
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
that
if
the
area
is
a
reservation,
we’re
not
allowed?
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
well,
i
frankly
i
don’t
recall
your
honor.
that’s
one
of
the
questions
that
i
may
have
occurred
to
me
at
some
already
point
in
the
case
and
that
i
simply
--
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
they
are
using
gill-nets,
your
honor.
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
these
are
large,
very
large
mesh
nets
that
catch
the
fish
as
they
go
--
as
they
swim
through
the
nets
by
the
gills
so
that
the
fish
cannot
return.
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
i
--
are
you
asking
whether
there
is
one
or
more
or
multiple
--
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
no,
this
can
be
hand
held.
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
it
varies.
a
gill-net
can
vary
from
a
very
--
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
yes,
yes,
it
commonly
yes.
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
in
the
precise
question
before
the
court,
we
do
not
know
the
answer
to
that
question.
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
i
am
not
sure,
your
honor.
i
would
think
that
if
the
indians
have
the
right
to
fish
on
the
reservation
for
the
wrong
purposes,
they’d
also
have
the
right
to
fish
on
the
reservation
for
commercial
purposes.
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
that’s
my
understanding.
now
if
--
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
and
california
can’t
do
a
thing
about
it.
now,
the
bia,
if
this
--
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
you
got
me
on
that
question,
your
honor.
i
can
probably
research
the
questions
and
submit
an
answer.
i
just
don’t
recall
frankly
the
source
of
the
proposition.
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
i
think
that’s
right
your
honor.
i
think
that’s
the
source
of
authority.
i
located
this
long
ago
mr.
justice
white
and
i
just
frankly
don’t
recall
my
--
the
source
of
that
information.
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
if
the
state
owns
the
bed
of
the
river
the
indians
can’t
fish
without
restriction
on
the
river
and
california
can
regulate
--
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
it’s
my
understanding
that
the
river
isn’t
navigable.
and
i
think
that
this
was
covered
in
donnelly
decision
at
page
711,
i
am
not
sure
--
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
this
goes
back
sometime
in
my
thinking
your
honor.
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
no,
i
think
that’s
correct
and
i
think
that’s
why
the
donnelly
court
originally
concluded
that
the
river
was
not
navigable
and
then
later,
it
found
that
california
had
some
special
legislation
concerning
your
question
of
navigability,
and
thus,
the
donnelly
court
changed
its
mind.
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
yes,
that’s
correct.
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
well
--
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
yes.
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
that’s
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
no,
you
are
absolutely
correct.
in
other
words,
if
the
area
is
a
reservation,
there
is
a
basis
for
california
still
regulating
the
fishing
on
the
area
if
there
was
no
federal
treaty,
agreement
or
statute.
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
right.
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
yes,
that’s
correct
your
honor.
that’s
absolutely
correct.
it’s
interesting
--
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
yes.
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
there
is
a
single
reference
in
the
1892
act
to
the
word
reservation
--
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
yes.
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
yes.
if
you
look
at
the
word
said
reservation
your
honor,
you
will
see
that
it
is
a
reference
back
to
the
statement
and
i
believe
it
is
prior
of
sentence
to
“land
--
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
oh!
this
is
done
quite
commonly,
your
honor.
this
was
done
in
the
--
with
respect
to
the
north
half
of
the
colville
reservation
in
1892
which
involved
an
act
that
was
passed
about
two
weeks
before
the
1892
act
before
this
court.
and
in
that
case,
congress
discontinued
the
north
half
of
the
colville
reservation,
and
yet
made
the
number
of
indian
allotments
on
the
old
existent
--
on
the
former
reservation.
and
this
court
held
in
both
united
states
versus
pelican
and
the
in
the
seymour
case
that
the
old
north
half
of
the
colville
reservation
was
terminated,
and
yet
that
individual
trust
allotments
of
indians
were
still
situated
on
the
old
area.
so
in
effect,
they
have
created
of
course
federal
enclave
type
situation.
the
court
has
expressed
i
think
some
concern
--
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
yes,
that’s
correct,
your
honor.
the
court
has
expressed
some
concern
about
the
type
of
regulation.
i
think
that
california
is
providing
with
respect
to
yurok
fishing
activity
in
the
klamath’s
river.
and
i
want
to
remind
the
court
that
the
section
7155
of
california
fish
and
game
code
is
the
code
section
under
which
we
regulate
yurok
fishing
activity
in
the
klamath’s
river.
incidentally,
i
made
an
error
in
my
opening
brief.
i
said
that
the
--
that
that
section
was
enacted
in
1957.
actually,
it
was
enacted
in
1951
and
it
was
re-codified
in
1957.
that
means
that
for
22
years,
nearly
a
quarter
of
a
century,
california
has
been
regulating
yurok
fishing
activity
in
the
klamath
river,
and
nobody
has
objected.
the
bia
has
not
objected.
they
never
offered
and
they
never
brought
any
lawsuit
against
the
state
the
california
with
respect
to
this
regulation.
now,
this
regulation
i
think
clearly
recognizes
the
very
special
circumstances
that
the
yurok
indians
find
themselves
in.
we
recognized
that
the
yuroks
are
in
impoverish
tribe
and
that
they
have
special
economic
and
social
needs,
and
that
they
do
deserve
some
special
consideration
under
california’s
fish
and
game
code
structure,
and
with
provided
this
type
of
protection
for
them
in
section
7155,
because
we’ve
immunized
them
from
many
of
the
restrictions
which
are
imposed
on
none
--
on
non-indians
on
whites
who
fish
in
the
same
river.
for
instance,
whites
who
fish
in
the
river
have
to
--
can
only
fish
can
only
fish
during
certain
seasons
of
the
year.
indians
can
fish
at
any
time
of
the
year
for
--
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
no,
your
honor.
under
the
code
section,
they
are
not
permitted
to
fish
and
catch
the
fish
and
then
sell
the
fish.
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
subsistence
purposes
only.
that’s
correct
your
honor.
and
also,
the
indians
are
not
subject
to
daily
bag
limits.
in
other
words,
they
can
simply
take
as
many
fish
as
they
want
from
the
river
each
day,
except
for
three
very
critical
types
of
fish,
the
sturgeon,
the
salmon
and
the
trout.
but
the
white
man
who
fishes
in
that
river
is
subject
to
daily
bag
limits
with
respect
to
every
type
of
fish.
so,
california
has
recognized
for
nearly
a
quarter
of
a
century
that
the
indians,
that
the
yurok
indians
fishing
in
that
area
has
special
problems
and
that
they
have
a
special
dependency
on
this
fishery,
unless
that
they
should
be
given
some
type
of
special
consideration.
but
at
the
same
time,
i
think
we
are
highly
cognizant
in
california
that
needs
of
the
fishery
itself,
it
needs
to
be
protected.
it
can’t
sustain
an
unending
yield
forever.
the
fish
and
game
officials
in
california
feel
very
strongly
that
if
the
yuroks
are
allowed
to
fish
without
restriction
in
this
area,
the
fishery
might
and
probably
very
will
be
irreparably
damage.
so,
in
california,
we
try
to
reconcile
these
two
competing
needs,
the
needs
of
the
indians,
the
needs
of
the
fishery
itself
and
we’ve
come
up
with
section
7155
which
has
worked
for
nearly
a
quarter
of
a
century
and
we
--
i
respectfully
ask
this
court
to
uphold
the
decision
of
the
california
court
of
appeals
and
allow
california
to
go
on
trying
to
work
--
working
this
question
out
on
an
ad
hoc
basis.
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
mr.
chief
justice,
may
i
add
one
additional
minute?
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
it’s
in
rebuttal
to
something,
your
honor.
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
just
one
fact
that
i
like
to
point
out
to
the
court’s
attention.
counsel
said
that
approximately
40%
of
the
old
klamath
river
reservation
was
taken
over
by
the
indians
after
the
1892
act
was
passed.
i
would
refer
the
court
to
the
annual
reports
of
the
commissioner
of
indian
affairs
to
the
secretary
of
interior
for
the
years
1895
through
1900.
for
example,
the
1895
report
at
page
582,
and
that
shows
that
the
total
acreage
cultivated
by
indians
on
both
the
klamath
river
reservation
and
the
upstream
20
miles
area
together
was
only
400
acres,
and
that
figure
reappears
in
each
annual
report
of
the
commissioner
from
1895
to
1900.
and
that
shows
that
the
klamath
river
reservation
--
that
the
indians
on
old
klamath
river
reservation
were
actually
cultivating
less
than
400
acres
on
the
old
reservation,
which
of
course
is
less
than
one
square
mile.
thank
you.
