mr.
lee
j.
sclar
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
california
court
of
appeal.
the
issue
presented
is
whether
an
1892
federal
statute
terminated
prior
of
an
indian
reservation,
and
thereby
made
that
area
subject
to
state
fishing
laws.
the
area
in
question
is
a
strip
1
mile
in
either
side
of
the
klamath
river
from
the
pacific
ocean
inland
for
20
miles.
this
area
together
with
the
next
20
miles
up
the
klamath
river
has
always
been
the
center
of
yurok
indian
life.
petitioner
raymond
mattz
is
a
yurok.
he
and
his
family,
and
his
ancestors
have
always
fished
along
this
stretch
of
the
klamath
river
and
they
have
done
so
with
large
nets
including
gill
nets.
in
september
of
1969
petitioner
mattz
had
five
gill
nets
stored
at
a
location
approximately
200
feet
from
the
klamath
river
and
about
10
miles
from
the
pacific
ocean.
the
land
belonged
to
the
simpson
timber
company
but
it
adjoined
an
allotment
of
petitioner
mattz’
mother,
and
the
nets
were
on
the
simpson
timber
company
land
by
mere
inadvertence.
mr.
lee
j.
sclar
in
view
of
other
rulings
by
this
court
in
seymour
and
by
lower
courts,
no
it
isn’t
your
honor.
however
if
it
had
proved
to
be
on
allotted
land
of
petitioner’s
mother,
then
the
issue
presented
by
this
case
would
not
arise
since
the
land
would
then
be
indian
country
even
if
it
wasn’t
in
an
indian
reservation.
a
game
warden
came
by
from
the
state
of
california,
saw
the
nets,
and
confiscated
them.
the
respondent
director
to
the
department
of
fish
and
game
then
instituted
a
proceeding
to
forfeit
the
nets
to
the
state.
petitioner
mattz
intervened
and
asked
for
returns
of
his
nets
saying
the
state
law
did
not
apply
because
the
nets
had
been
seized
in
indian
country.
the
trial
court
ruled
for
the
state
ruling
that
although
the
area
had
at
one
time
been
a
private
indian
reservation,
but
that
reservation
had
been
terminated
by
an
1892
statute
which
opened
the
land
for
public
purchase.
the
decision
was
affirmed
on
the
same
grounds
by
the
california
court
of
appeals
and
the
california
supreme
court
declined
to
hear
the
case.
in
order
to
understand
why
the
decisions
by
the
california
courts
were
wrong,
it’s
necessary
to
understand
the
legal
history
of
this
area,
and
i
would
ask
if
the
court
could
refer
to
the
maps
supplied
by
the
solicitor
general
in
this
argument.
the
first
reservation
created
in
this
area
was
the
klamath
river
reservation.
it’s
not,
excuse
me
your
honors,
it
is
not
in
the
brief
of
the
solicitor
general,
but
it
was
supposed
to
have
been
supplied
to
the
court,
especially
this
morning.
they’re
relatively
small
maps,
wait.
mr.
lee
j.
sclar
okay,
well
i
would
try
to
describe
it
without
the
maps.
the
first
reservation
created
was
a
strip
2
miles
wide
on
either
side
of
the
klamath
river
from
the
pacific
inland
for
20
miles.
that
is
the
same
area
in
dispute
here.
it’s
shown
on
the
little
maps
in
--
mr.
lee
j.
sclar
oh,
i’m
perfectly
familiar
with
it.
i
just
thought
that
every
member
of
the
court
would
like
to
be
able
to
look
at
when
while
i
discuss
this.
mr.
lee
j.
sclar
i’d
also
appear
--
no,
i
don’t
think
it’s
actually
in
any
of
the
briefs.
it
was
supplied
separately.
mr.
lee
j.
sclar
right,
that’s
the
map.
mr.
lee
j.
sclar
i
apologize
to
the
court
for
that
situation.
i
understood
that
nine
copies
had
been
delivered
and
that
each
--
mr.
lee
j.
sclar
the
area
that’s
in
dispute
that
is
the
2-mile
strip
from
the
ocean
inland
for
20
miles
was
first
established
as
a
reservation
in
1855,
and
it
was
done
by
a
presidential
proclamation
and
called
the
klamath
river
reservation.
in
1864,
congress
passed
the
statute
authorizing
the
creation
of
four
reservations
in
california.
pursuant
to
the
statute,
the
four
reservations
were
created
by
1876
and
one
of
those
reservations
was
the
hoopa
valley
indian
reservation.
that
reservation
is
shown
on
the
little
map
as
the
green
square.
it’s
an
area
approximately
50
miles
down
stream
on
the
klamath
river
and
approximately
12
miles
square.
the
result
of
that
is
that
there
between
the
klamath
river
reservation
and
the
hoopa
square,
there’s
a
gap
of
klamath
river
that
at
that
time
was
not
part
of
a
reservation.
the
federal
government
however
continued
to
recognize
the
existence
of
the
klamath
river
reservation
as
an
indian
reservation
until
1889.
at
that
time
a
federal
court
declared
that
the
klamath
river
reservation
was
no
longer
a
reservation
because
it
had
not
been
included
in
one
of
the
four
reservations
authorized
by
the
1864
act.
it
did
that
on
a
basis
of
a
statute
which
said
that
reservations,
a
provision
in
the
1864
act
saying
that
“reservations
not
included
in
the
four
reservations
should
not
be
retained
for
indian
purposes”.
so
in
1889,
the
situation
was
that
you
have
the
hoopa
valley
indian
reservation
that
is
the
square
and
no
other
reservations
recognized
by
the
courts
in
that
area.
however,
in
1891
the
president
moved
to
correct
the
situation
caused
by
the
court
decision
in
1889,
and
the
president
issued
an
executive
order
extending
the
hoopa
valley
indian
reservation
from
the
hoopa
square
all
the
way
up
to
the
klamath
river
to
the
pacific
ocean
in
a
2-mile
strip,
1
mile
on
either
side
of
the
river.
that
executive
order
extending
the
hoopa
valley
indian
reservation
was
upheld
by
this
court
in
u.s.
v.
donnelly
in
1912
and
the
extension
that
is
the
addition
to
the
hoopa
valley
indian
reservation,
the
2-mile
wide
approximately
50
mile
long
strip
became
known
as
the
hoopa
extension.
mr.
lee
j.
sclar
the
combination
of
the
yellow
and
red
together
constitute
the
hoopa
extension.
that
is
correct.
then
we
come
to
the
act
of
1872
which
is
the
crux
of
this
case.
that
act
had
three
significant
provisions.
first
of
all,
it
provided
that
indians
living
on
the
red
area
that
is
the
lower
20
miles
of
the
extension
should
receive
allotments
of
land
there
in
priority
over
anybody
else,
including
white
settlers
who
may
have
innocently
settled
in
that
area
thinking
that
it
was
not
part
of
a
reservation
anymore.
secondly,
the
secretary
of
the
interior
was
authorized
to
set
aside
indian
villages
in
that
area.
and
thirdly,
the
area
that
was
not
allotted
and
not
reserved
for
indian
villagers
was
opened
up
to
non-indian
purchase
under
the
general
land
laws
of
united
states.
however,
one
exception
was
made
to
the
general
land
law
disposition
and
that
was
that
the
proceeds
of
the
money
instead
of
accruing
to
the
united
states
were
to
be
used
solely
for
the
benefit
of
the
indians.
that
statutory
pattern
in
the
1892
act
is
in
our
opinion
not
distinguishable
from
the
pattern
of
the
south
colville
reservation
act
which
this
court
in
seymour
said
did
not
abolish
the
south
half
of
the
colville
reservation.
it
is
we
feel,
completely
different
from
the
north
colville
reservation
act
which
seymour
held
did
abolish
the
north
half
of
the
colville
reservation.
the
two
really
significant
differences
that
we’ve
seen
between
the
hoopa
act
and
the
north
colville
act
is
that
the
north
colville
act
expressly
vacated
and
restored
the
north
half
of
colville
to
the
public
domain.
there
is
no
such
provision
in
either
the
south
colville
act
or
in
the
hoopa
extension
act.
additionally,
the
north
colville
act
allowed
for
public
use
of
the
proceeds
of
the
sale
surplus
land.
there
is
no
such
provision
in
the
hoopa
extension
act.
in
fact
as
i
pointed
out
quite
to
the
contrary,
the
act
specifically
provides
that
only
indians
are
to
be
the
beneficiaries.
in
addition
to
the
statutory
language
differences,
the
legislative
history
also
shows
that
congress
have
no
intent
to
terminate
the
lower
20
miles
and
the
hoopa
extension
by
the
1892
act.
the
senate
deleted
from
the
house
bill
provision
that
would’ve
allowed
the
sale
proceeds
to
be
used
to
remove
the
indians
from
the
reservation.
the
congress
as
a
whole
concurred
in
the
senate
move.
additionally,
the
provision
giving
indians
allotments
with
priority
over
all
other
settlers
was
added
in
the
senate
after
no
such
provision
was
in
the
house
bill.
thirdly,
this
bill
is
clearly
reflected
in
the
legislative
history,
came
out
of
the
senate
and
substantially
the
form
recommended
by
the
interior
department.
and
it
is
simply
inconceivable
that
the
interior
department
had
recommended
an
1892
bill
that
would
have
the
effect
of
terminating
a
reservation
which
the
president
had
only
created
in
october
of
1891
at
the
request
of
the
interior
department.
there
are
also
references
in
the
legislative
history
to
an
abandoned
reservation,
but
if
you
read
the
legislative
history
closely,
especially
the
house
committee
report,
you
find
that
those
references
are
to
the
klamath
river
reservation
which
is
we
pointed
out
had
been
declared
to
be
nonexistent
back
before
in
1889,
because
it
was
not
one
of
the
four
reservations
under
the
1864
act.
finally,
i
would
like
to
point
out
as
far
as
the
legislative
history
goes
that
there
is
no
mention
whatsoever
in
any
of
the
legislative
history
of
the
1891
hoopa
extension.
and
it
seems
totally
inconsistent
with
this
court’s
holding
in
united
states
versus
celestine
that
a
clear
intent
is
needed
to
terminate
a
reservation
that
congress
not
even
mentioning
the
reservation,
could’ve
intended
to
terminate
it.
there’re
also
subsequent
acts
which
show
that
this
area
was
not
intended
to
be
terminated.
in
1893,
161
allotments
were
made
to
the
indians
pursuant
to
the
1892
act.
those
allotments
constituted
40%
of
the
lower
20
miles
that
is
the
area
that
had
been
over
it.
the
161
allotments
were
described
in
the
1893
report
of
the
commissioner
of
indian
affairs
as
being
on
reservation.
the
commissioner’s
report
had
two
sections.
one
for
on
reservation
allotments,
one
for
public
domain
allotments
these
reservations
were
in
it.
these
allotments
were
in
the
on
reservation
section.
mr.
lee
j.
sclar
the
area
covered
is
the
red
area.
the
--
mr.
lee
j.
sclar
that
is
all.
the
red
area
is
the
area
that
was
opened
up
after
being
allotted
and
having
villages
reserved.
mr.
lee
j.
sclar
no,
your
honor.
many
of
them
do
not
live
on
the
reservation
as
such
but
the
live
--
a
great
number
of
them
live
in
surrounding
area
and
come
to
this
area
to
fish.
the
area
is
very
difficult
to
inhabit
because
it’s
very
difficult
to
get
in
and
out
of
it.
about
half,
it
has
no
roads
at
all.
people
come
there
on
summer
vacations.
they
come
there
on
fishing
expeditions,
but
the
area
is
still
regarded
as
the
center
of
yurok
life.
mr.
lee
j.
sclar
roughly
3000.
mr.
lee
j.
sclar
yes.
yes,
virtually
all
of
them
so
far
as
i
know.
additional
subsequent
things
which
we
think
tend
to
show
that
this
area
was
intended
to
remain
as
an
indian
reservation
are
maps
of
the
commissioner
of
indian
affairs
reports
showing
the
area
continued
to
be
a
reservation.
testimony
in
1932,
the
congress
by
the
hoopa
agency
superintendent
saying
that
all
of
the
extension
from
the
square
to
the
ocean
as
well
as
the
square
was
all
one
of
the
reservation
and
under
the
jurisdiction
of
the
bureau
of
indian
affairs.
and
i
point
out
that
a
census
done
on
the
same
year,
apparently
the
last
census
done
on
this
basis
by
the
bia
showed
that
there
were
more
indians
living
on
the
lower
20
miles
of
the
extension
than
on
either
the
other
part
of
the
extension,
or
on
the
square.
there’re
also
acts
from
1920,
1942
and
1958
which
confirm
the
reservation
status
of
this
area
there
explained
on
the
brief,
i
won’t
detail
them
here.
in
the
national
atlas,
the
official
atlas
of
the
united
states
and
the
1971
bureau
of
indian
affairs
map
of
indian
land
areas
both
show
this
area
as
being
part
of
an
indian
reservation.
in
conclusion,
i
think
to
say
that
the
1892
act
terminated
this
indian
reservation
would
go
contrary
to
the
requirement
of
celestine
that
there
be
a
clear
intent
to
terminate,
would
be
contrary
to
the
decisions
of
this
court
in
choate
v.
trapp,
alaska
pacific
fisheries
and
squire
v.
capoeman
that
was
--
that
are
ambiguous,
or
be
it
construed
in
the
indian’s
favor.
it
would
be
contrary
to
the
holding
of
this
court
in
seymour
as
the
act
of
1892
applying
to
the
hoopa
extension
is
like
the
south
colville
act
and
not
like
the
north
colville
act.
and
it
would
work
a
great
injustice
on
the
yurok
indians
whose
life
is
centered
here,
and
who
received
very
small
reservation
to
begin
with.
thank
you.
mr.
lee
j.
sclar
mr.
chief
justice,
i
have
completed
my
--
mr.
lee
j.
sclar
yes,
i
have.
yes.
mr.
lee
j.
sclar
yes.
unfortunately,
your
honor
i
think
i
have
all
to
short
of
period
of
time
here,
but
i
will
try
to
answer
a
number
of
questions
that
have
been
raised.
as
to
the
conservation
issue,
i’d
like
to
point
out
that
the
state
of
california
is
not
the
only
agency
capable
of
regulating
this
fishery.
the
federal
government
and
the
indians
are
quite
capable
of
regulating
and
the
indians
did
so
before
the
white
man
arrived.
the
bureau
of
sport
fisheries
of
the
department
of
interior
presently
has
a
program
which
you
can
tell
from
the
interior
hearings
for
fiscal
year
in
19
--
that
the
interior
appropriation
hearings
for
fiscal
1973,
operating
on
75
or
80
indian
reservations
in
this
country.
one
of
those,
although
it
doesn’t
appear
anywhere
in
the
record
is
the
hoopa
indian
reservation.
i’d
also
like
to
deal
with
this
question
of
what
types
of
nets
have
historically
been
used
on
this
reservation.
if
you
look
at
page
839
of
the
appendix,
you’ll
find
that
the
indians
have
historically
fished
here
with
large
nets,
very
large
nets
including
gill
nets
up
to,
i
believe
its
85
feet
long.
mr.
lee
j.
sclar
85
feet
long.
in
other
words,
these
are
the
same
types
of
gill
nets
being
used
today
with
the
exception
that
the
nets
are
being
made
today
are
of
nylon
instead
of
out
of
cord.
but
the
type
of
--
mr.
lee
j.
sclar
yes,
they
did
your
honor.
mr.
lee
j.
sclar
it’s
in
the
appendix.
if
you
look
at
kroeber,
he
doesn’t
point
to
any
particular
year.
mr.
lee
j.
sclar
a.
l.
kroeber
is
an
anthropologist
who
did
the
most
definitive
studies
in
the
california
indians.
his
book
has
been
judicially
noticed
by
a
number
of
courts
and
we
have
reprinted
the
parts
of
his
book
dealing
with
fishing
by
the
yurok
indians
in
the
klamath
river
in
the
appendix.
he
does
not
point
to
any
particular
year
when
this
was
being
done,
but
his
anthropological
study
discussing
the
conditional
life
patterns
of
the
klamath
indians.
mr.
lee
j.
sclar
yes,
your
honor,
it
was.
mr.
lee
j.
sclar
no,
the
court
just
judicially
has
the
book,
but
your
honors,
the
court
ruled
that
the
whole
issue
was
irrelevant,
that
the
conservational
question
was
irrelevant
to
the
case
because
he
determined
that
the
area
either
was
or
was
not
an
indian
reservation,
and
therefore
state
law
would
or
would
not
apply
regardless
of
the
conservation
question.
mr.
lee
j.
sclar
your
honor,
i
would
like
to
answer
that.
at
this
point,
i
would
not
like
to
take
the
absolute
position
of
the
state
under
no
circumstances
could
regulate,
but
i’d
like
to
tell
you
the
source
of
the
indian
fishing
rights
which
i
think
is
your
principal
question.
there
are
three
sources
that
the
indians
claim
here.
one
is
the
executive
order
establishing
the
reservation
for
indian
purposes.
you
remember
that
the
extension
is
an
extension
of
the
hoopa
valley
reservation
set
aside
for
indian
purposes.
in
a
california
case,
donegan
versus
the
california
justice
court,
15
cal
third
of
562,
the
court
held
that
that
provision
for
indian
purposes
encompass
indian
fishing
rights.
this
court
is
done
a
similar
thing
in
the
case
of
menominee
versus
united
states
at
391
u.s.
404
at
405,
406
implied
in
a
treaty
with
the
menominees
that
the
setting
aside
the
reservation
abuses
in
indian
reservation,
implicitly
gave
indian
fishing
rights.
a
second
basis
the
indians
claim
for
their
fishing
rights
is
18
u.s.c.
1165
which
vest
in
the
indians
the
absolute
right
to
determine
who
shall
fish
on
an
indian
reservation.
and
finally,
the
indians
in
this
case
claimed
that
there
is
an
implied
agreement
between
the
united
states
and
the
indians,
giving
them
fishing
rights
on
the
reservation
--
mr.
lee
j.
sclar
well
your
honor,
at
this
point,
we
do
not
claim
that.
this
man
was
not
fishing
for
commercial
purposes.
there
was
no
assertion
he
was
fishing
for
commercial
purposes.
the
question
isn’t
raise.
we
would
claim
that
there
are
commercial
fishing
rights
in
this
indians
that
when
congress
set
apart
the
reservation
originally
and
understood
--
mr.
lee
j.
sclar
just
for
personal
use,
for
family
use.
mr.
lee
j.
sclar
yes,
your
honor.
the
indians
had
historically
fished
that
way.
mr.
lee
j.
sclar
no.
mr.
lee
j.
sclar
yes,
your
honor.
i
mean,
i
was
answering
justice
white’s
question
merely.
it
is
not
before
this
court.
no,
your
honor.
mr.
lee
j.
sclar
that
is
correct
your
honor.
although
my
time
is
expired
your
honor,
would
it
be
possible
for
me
to
discuss
this
question
of
the
number
of
indians
living
on
the
reservation?
mr.
lee
j.
sclar
thank
you.
there
is
one
other
thing
justice
white
i
like
to
say,
that
fact
that
whether
the
river
bed
is
or
is
not
part
of
the
reservation
is
not
an
issue
which
i
believe
would
be
dispositive
of
the
case.
in
donnelly,
the
court
stated
that
it
assume
that
the
river
was
none
navigable
and
then
said
that
whether
or
not
the
river
was
navigable
in
fact,
its
bed
was
deemed
as
included
within
the
extension
of
the
hoopa
valley
reservation.
this
is
the
court
on
a
reconsideration
of
the
case
speaking
at
page
710.
mr.
lee
j.
sclar
in
addition
to
that,
i
would
point
out
that
these
nets
were
in
fact
seized
200
feet
from
the
river,
so
that
i
don’t
think
whether
the
rivers
included
would
solve
the
question.
i
asked
to
the
number
of
indians
living
on
the
reservation.
the
record
--
i
think
does
not
support
what
has
been
said.
40%
of
this
land
was
allotted
to
the
indians
of
this
reservation
and
in
addition,
the
indians
were
given
villages.
we
do
not
know
how
many
indians
lived
in
those
villages.
the
worst
statements
made
on
the
floor
of
congress
saying
that
there
were
only
40
to
60
indians
there,
but
i
think
those
were
--
the
remarks
rather
over
eager
promoters
of
the
settlers
interests
and
not
the
views
of
the
congress.
the
references
to
an
abandoned
reservation
in
the
house
where
repudiated
in
the
senate.
they
in
addition
were
clearly
referring
to
the
klamath
river
reservation
if
you
read
the
house
report
in
its
entirety,
you
see
that
the
words
“abandoned
reservation”
to
refer
reservation
abandoned
at
the
1860’s
and
they
talked
about
the
decision
if
forty-eight
pounds
of
rising
star
tea
which
is
the
decision
which
said
that
the
klamath
river
reservation
could
not
continue
to
exist
because
it
violated
the
1864
for
reservations
act.
they
where
not
talking
about
the
hoopa
extension
as
is
clear
by
the
fact
that
during
the
debates,
there
is
no
mention
of
the
hoopa
extension
and
in
fact,
the
--
at
two
points,
the
congress
indicated
they
didn’t
even
think
there
was
a
reservation
legally
in
this
area.
finally,
i
would
like
to
say
that
the
phrase
“what
was
the
klamath
river
reservation
in
this
act”
is
not
subject
to
conflicting
interest
of
interpretations.
i
have
never
suggested
that.
i
think
it’s
only
subject
to
one
inference,
and
that
is
that
the
klamath
river
reservation
was
dead
at
the
time
that
this
1892
act
was
passed
that
congress
knew
it
was
shown
in
house
act
and
have
been
held
so,
and
that
that
phrase
was
used
merely
to
describe
a
particular
portion
of
land,
not
to
have
any
tarnations
effect.
i
would
contrast
that
with
the
act
passed
two
weeks
later
relating
to
the
north
half
of
colville
which
said
that
this
reservation
is
here
by
vacated
and
restored
on
public
domain.
mr.
lee
j.
sclar
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
california
court
of
appeal.
the
issue
presented
is
whether
an
1892
federal
statute
terminated
prior
of
an
indian
reservation,
and
thereby
made
that
area
subject
to
state
fishing
laws.
the
area
in
question
is
a
strip
1
mile
in
either
side
of
the
klamath
river
from
the
pacific
ocean
inland
for
20
miles.
this
area
together
with
the
next
20
miles
up
the
klamath
river
has
always
been
the
center
of
yurok
indian
life.
petitioner
raymond
mattz
is
a
yurok.
he
and
his
family,
and
his
ancestors
have
always
fished
along
this
stretch
of
the
klamath
river
and
they
have
done
so
with
large
nets
including
gill
nets.
in
september
of
1969
petitioner
mattz
had
five
gill
nets
stored
at
a
location
approximately
200
feet
from
the
klamath
river
and
about
10
miles
from
the
pacific
ocean.
the
land
belonged
to
the
simpson
timber
company
but
it
adjoined
an
allotment
of
petitioner
mattz’
mother,
and
the
nets
were
on
the
simpson
timber
company
land
by
mere
inadvertence.
mr.
lee
j.
sclar
in
view
of
other
rulings
by
this
court
in
seymour
and
by
lower
courts,
no
it
isn’t
your
honor.
however
if
it
had
proved
to
be
on
allotted
land
of
petitioner’s
mother,
then
the
issue
presented
by
this
case
would
not
arise
since
the
land
would
then
be
indian
country
even
if
it
wasn’t
in
an
indian
reservation.
a
game
warden
came
by
from
the
state
of
california,
saw
the
nets,
and
confiscated
them.
the
respondent
director
to
the
department
of
fish
and
game
then
instituted
a
proceeding
to
forfeit
the
nets
to
the
state.
petitioner
mattz
intervened
and
asked
for
returns
of
his
nets
saying
the
state
law
did
not
apply
because
the
nets
had
been
seized
in
indian
country.
the
trial
court
ruled
for
the
state
ruling
that
although
the
area
had
at
one
time
been
a
private
indian
reservation,
but
that
reservation
had
been
terminated
by
an
1892
statute
which
opened
the
land
for
public
purchase.
the
decision
was
affirmed
on
the
same
grounds
by
the
california
court
of
appeals
and
the
california
supreme
court
declined
to
hear
the
case.
in
order
to
understand
why
the
decisions
by
the
california
courts
were
wrong,
it’s
necessary
to
understand
the
legal
history
of
this
area,
and
i
would
ask
if
the
court
could
refer
to
the
maps
supplied
by
the
solicitor
general
in
this
argument.
the
first
reservation
created
in
this
area
was
the
klamath
river
reservation.
it’s
not,
excuse
me
your
honors,
it
is
not
in
the
brief
of
the
solicitor
general,
but
it
was
supposed
to
have
been
supplied
to
the
court,
especially
this
morning.
they’re
relatively
small
maps,
wait.
mr.
lee
j.
sclar
okay,
well
i
would
try
to
describe
it
without
the
maps.
the
first
reservation
created
was
a
strip
2
miles
wide
on
either
side
of
the
klamath
river
from
the
pacific
inland
for
20
miles.
that
is
the
same
area
in
dispute
here.
it’s
shown
on
the
little
maps
in
--
mr.
lee
j.
sclar
oh,
i’m
perfectly
familiar
with
it.
i
just
thought
that
every
member
of
the
court
would
like
to
be
able
to
look
at
when
while
i
discuss
this.
mr.
lee
j.
sclar
i’d
also
appear
--
no,
i
don’t
think
it’s
actually
in
any
of
the
briefs.
it
was
supplied
separately.
mr.
lee
j.
sclar
right,
that’s
the
map.
mr.
lee
j.
sclar
i
apologize
to
the
court
for
that
situation.
i
understood
that
nine
copies
had
been
delivered
and
that
each
--
mr.
lee
j.
sclar
the
area
that’s
in
dispute
that
is
the
2-mile
strip
from
the
ocean
inland
for
20
miles
was
first
established
as
a
reservation
in
1855,
and
it
was
done
by
a
presidential
proclamation
and
called
the
klamath
river
reservation.
in
1864,
congress
passed
the
statute
authorizing
the
creation
of
four
reservations
in
california.
pursuant
to
the
statute,
the
four
reservations
were
created
by
1876
and
one
of
those
reservations
was
the
hoopa
valley
indian
reservation.
that
reservation
is
shown
on
the
little
map
as
the
green
square.
it’s
an
area
approximately
50
miles
down
stream
on
the
klamath
river
and
approximately
12
miles
square.
the
result
of
that
is
that
there
between
the
klamath
river
reservation
and
the
hoopa
square,
there’s
a
gap
of
klamath
river
that
at
that
time
was
not
part
of
a
reservation.
the
federal
government
however
continued
to
recognize
the
existence
of
the
klamath
river
reservation
as
an
indian
reservation
until
1889.
at
that
time
a
federal
court
declared
that
the
klamath
river
reservation
was
no
longer
a
reservation
because
it
had
not
been
included
in
one
of
the
four
reservations
authorized
by
the
1864
act.
it
did
that
on
a
basis
of
a
statute
which
said
that
reservations,
a
provision
in
the
1864
act
saying
that
“reservations
not
included
in
the
four
reservations
should
not
be
retained
for
indian
purposes”.
so
in
1889,
the
situation
was
that
you
have
the
hoopa
valley
indian
reservation
that
is
the
square
and
no
other
reservations
recognized
by
the
courts
in
that
area.
however,
in
1891
the
president
moved
to
correct
the
situation
caused
by
the
court
decision
in
1889,
and
the
president
issued
an
executive
order
extending
the
hoopa
valley
indian
reservation
from
the
hoopa
square
all
the
way
up
to
the
klamath
river
to
the
pacific
ocean
in
a
2-mile
strip,
1
mile
on
either
side
of
the
river.
that
executive
order
extending
the
hoopa
valley
indian
reservation
was
upheld
by
this
court
in
u.s.
v.
donnelly
in
1912
and
the
extension
that
is
the
addition
to
the
hoopa
valley
indian
reservation,
the
2-mile
wide
approximately
50
mile
long
strip
became
known
as
the
hoopa
extension.
mr.
lee
j.
sclar
the
combination
of
the
yellow
and
red
together
constitute
the
hoopa
extension.
that
is
correct.
then
we
come
to
the
act
of
1872
which
is
the
crux
of
this
case.
that
act
had
three
significant
provisions.
first
of
all,
it
provided
that
indians
living
on
the
red
area
that
is
the
lower
20
miles
of
the
extension
should
receive
allotments
of
land
there
in
priority
over
anybody
else,
including
white
settlers
who
may
have
innocently
settled
in
that
area
thinking
that
it
was
not
part
of
a
reservation
anymore.
secondly,
the
secretary
of
the
interior
was
authorized
to
set
aside
indian
villages
in
that
area.
and
thirdly,
the
area
that
was
not
allotted
and
not
reserved
for
indian
villagers
was
opened
up
to
non-indian
purchase
under
the
general
land
laws
of
united
states.
however,
one
exception
was
made
to
the
general
land
law
disposition
and
that
was
that
the
proceeds
of
the
money
instead
of
accruing
to
the
united
states
were
to
be
used
solely
for
the
benefit
of
the
indians.
that
statutory
pattern
in
the
1892
act
is
in
our
opinion
not
distinguishable
from
the
pattern
of
the
south
colville
reservation
act
which
this
court
in
seymour
said
did
not
abolish
the
south
half
of
the
colville
reservation.
it
is
we
feel,
completely
different
from
the
north
colville
reservation
act
which
seymour
held
did
abolish
the
north
half
of
the
colville
reservation.
the
two
really
significant
differences
that
we’ve
seen
between
the
hoopa
act
and
the
north
colville
act
is
that
the
north
colville
act
expressly
vacated
and
restored
the
north
half
of
colville
to
the
public
domain.
there
is
no
such
provision
in
either
the
south
colville
act
or
in
the
hoopa
extension
act.
additionally,
the
north
colville
act
allowed
for
public
use
of
the
proceeds
of
the
sale
surplus
land.
there
is
no
such
provision
in
the
hoopa
extension
act.
in
fact
as
i
pointed
out
quite
to
the
contrary,
the
act
specifically
provides
that
only
indians
are
to
be
the
beneficiaries.
in
addition
to
the
statutory
language
differences,
the
legislative
history
also
shows
that
congress
have
no
intent
to
terminate
the
lower
20
miles
and
the
hoopa
extension
by
the
1892
act.
the
senate
deleted
from
the
house
bill
provision
that
would’ve
allowed
the
sale
proceeds
to
be
used
to
remove
the
indians
from
the
reservation.
the
congress
as
a
whole
concurred
in
the
senate
move.
additionally,
the
provision
giving
indians
allotments
with
priority
over
all
other
settlers
was
added
in
the
senate
after
no
such
provision
was
in
the
house
bill.
thirdly,
this
bill
is
clearly
reflected
in
the
legislative
history,
came
out
of
the
senate
and
substantially
the
form
recommended
by
the
interior
department.
and
it
is
simply
inconceivable
that
the
interior
department
had
recommended
an
1892
bill
that
would
have
the
effect
of
terminating
a
reservation
which
the
president
had
only
created
in
october
of
1891
at
the
request
of
the
interior
department.
there
are
also
references
in
the
legislative
history
to
an
abandoned
reservation,
but
if
you
read
the
legislative
history
closely,
especially
the
house
committee
report,
you
find
that
those
references
are
to
the
klamath
river
reservation
which
is
we
pointed
out
had
been
declared
to
be
nonexistent
back
before
in
1889,
because
it
was
not
one
of
the
four
reservations
under
the
1864
act.
finally,
i
would
like
to
point
out
as
far
as
the
legislative
history
goes
that
there
is
no
mention
whatsoever
in
any
of
the
legislative
history
of
the
1891
hoopa
extension.
and
it
seems
totally
inconsistent
with
this
court’s
holding
in
united
states
versus
celestine
that
a
clear
intent
is
needed
to
terminate
a
reservation
that
congress
not
even
mentioning
the
reservation,
could’ve
intended
to
terminate
it.
there’re
also
subsequent
acts
which
show
that
this
area
was
not
intended
to
be
terminated.
in
1893,
161
allotments
were
made
to
the
indians
pursuant
to
the
1892
act.
those
allotments
constituted
40%
of
the
lower
20
miles
that
is
the
area
that
had
been
over
it.
the
161
allotments
were
described
in
the
1893
report
of
the
commissioner
of
indian
affairs
as
being
on
reservation.
the
commissioner’s
report
had
two
sections.
one
for
on
reservation
allotments,
one
for
public
domain
allotments
these
reservations
were
in
it.
these
allotments
were
in
the
on
reservation
section.
mr.
lee
j.
sclar
the
area
covered
is
the
red
area.
the
--
mr.
lee
j.
sclar
that
is
all.
the
red
area
is
the
area
that
was
opened
up
after
being
allotted
and
having
villages
reserved.
mr.
lee
j.
sclar
no,
your
honor.
many
of
them
do
not
live
on
the
reservation
as
such
but
the
live
--
a
great
number
of
them
live
in
surrounding
area
and
come
to
this
area
to
fish.
the
area
is
very
difficult
to
inhabit
because
it’s
very
difficult
to
get
in
and
out
of
it.
about
half,
it
has
no
roads
at
all.
people
come
there
on
summer
vacations.
they
come
there
on
fishing
expeditions,
but
the
area
is
still
regarded
as
the
center
of
yurok
life.
mr.
lee
j.
sclar
roughly
3000.
mr.
lee
j.
sclar
yes.
yes,
virtually
all
of
them
so
far
as
i
know.
additional
subsequent
things
which
we
think
tend
to
show
that
this
area
was
intended
to
remain
as
an
indian
reservation
are
maps
of
the
commissioner
of
indian
affairs
reports
showing
the
area
continued
to
be
a
reservation.
testimony
in
1932,
the
congress
by
the
hoopa
agency
superintendent
saying
that
all
of
the
extension
from
the
square
to
the
ocean
as
well
as
the
square
was
all
one
of
the
reservation
and
under
the
jurisdiction
of
the
bureau
of
indian
affairs.
and
i
point
out
that
a
census
done
on
the
same
year,
apparently
the
last
census
done
on
this
basis
by
the
bia
showed
that
there
were
more
indians
living
on
the
lower
20
miles
of
the
extension
than
on
either
the
other
part
of
the
extension,
or
on
the
square.
there’re
also
acts
from
1920,
1942
and
1958
which
confirm
the
reservation
status
of
this
area
there
explained
on
the
brief,
i
won’t
detail
them
here.
in
the
national
atlas,
the
official
atlas
of
the
united
states
and
the
1971
bureau
of
indian
affairs
map
of
indian
land
areas
both
show
this
area
as
being
part
of
an
indian
reservation.
in
conclusion,
i
think
to
say
that
the
1892
act
terminated
this
indian
reservation
would
go
contrary
to
the
requirement
of
celestine
that
there
be
a
clear
intent
to
terminate,
would
be
contrary
to
the
decisions
of
this
court
in
choate
v.
trapp,
alaska
pacific
fisheries
and
squire
v.
capoeman
that
was
--
that
are
ambiguous,
or
be
it
construed
in
the
indian’s
favor.
it
would
be
contrary
to
the
holding
of
this
court
in
seymour
as
the
act
of
1892
applying
to
the
hoopa
extension
is
like
the
south
colville
act
and
not
like
the
north
colville
act.
and
it
would
work
a
great
injustice
on
the
yurok
indians
whose
life
is
centered
here,
and
who
received
very
small
reservation
to
begin
with.
thank
you.
mr.
lee
j.
sclar
mr.
chief
justice,
i
have
completed
my
--
mr.
lee
j.
sclar
yes,
i
have.
yes.
mr.
lee
j.
sclar
yes.
unfortunately,
your
honor
i
think
i
have
all
to
short
of
period
of
time
here,
but
i
will
try
to
answer
a
number
of
questions
that
have
been
raised.
as
to
the
conservation
issue,
i’d
like
to
point
out
that
the
state
of
california
is
not
the
only
agency
capable
of
regulating
this
fishery.
the
federal
government
and
the
indians
are
quite
capable
of
regulating
and
the
indians
did
so
before
the
white
man
arrived.
the
bureau
of
sport
fisheries
of
the
department
of
interior
presently
has
a
program
which
you
can
tell
from
the
interior
hearings
for
fiscal
year
in
19
--
that
the
interior
appropriation
hearings
for
fiscal
1973,
operating
on
75
or
80
indian
reservations
in
this
country.
one
of
those,
although
it
doesn’t
appear
anywhere
in
the
record
is
the
hoopa
indian
reservation.
i’d
also
like
to
deal
with
this
question
of
what
types
of
nets
have
historically
been
used
on
this
reservation.
if
you
look
at
page
839
of
the
appendix,
you’ll
find
that
the
indians
have
historically
fished
here
with
large
nets,
very
large
nets
including
gill
nets
up
to,
i
believe
its
85
feet
long.
mr.
lee
j.
sclar
85
feet
long.
in
other
words,
these
are
the
same
types
of
gill
nets
being
used
today
with
the
exception
that
the
nets
are
being
made
today
are
of
nylon
instead
of
out
of
cord.
but
the
type
of
--
mr.
lee
j.
sclar
yes,
they
did
your
honor.
mr.
lee
j.
sclar
it’s
in
the
appendix.
if
you
look
at
kroeber,
he
doesn’t
point
to
any
particular
year.
mr.
lee
j.
sclar
a.
l.
kroeber
is
an
anthropologist
who
did
the
most
definitive
studies
in
the
california
indians.
his
book
has
been
judicially
noticed
by
a
number
of
courts
and
we
have
reprinted
the
parts
of
his
book
dealing
with
fishing
by
the
yurok
indians
in
the
klamath
river
in
the
appendix.
he
does
not
point
to
any
particular
year
when
this
was
being
done,
but
his
anthropological
study
discussing
the
conditional
life
patterns
of
the
klamath
indians.
mr.
lee
j.
sclar
yes,
your
honor,
it
was.
mr.
lee
j.
sclar
no,
the
court
just
judicially
has
the
book,
but
your
honors,
the
court
ruled
that
the
whole
issue
was
irrelevant,
that
the
conservational
question
was
irrelevant
to
the
case
because
he
determined
that
the
area
either
was
or
was
not
an
indian
reservation,
and
therefore
state
law
would
or
would
not
apply
regardless
of
the
conservation
question.
mr.
lee
j.
sclar
your
honor,
i
would
like
to
answer
that.
at
this
point,
i
would
not
like
to
take
the
absolute
position
of
the
state
under
no
circumstances
could
regulate,
but
i’d
like
to
tell
you
the
source
of
the
indian
fishing
rights
which
i
think
is
your
principal
question.
there
are
three
sources
that
the
indians
claim
here.
one
is
the
executive
order
establishing
the
reservation
for
indian
purposes.
you
remember
that
the
extension
is
an
extension
of
the
hoopa
valley
reservation
set
aside
for
indian
purposes.
in
a
california
case,
donegan
versus
the
california
justice
court,
15
cal
third
of
562,
the
court
held
that
that
provision
for
indian
purposes
encompass
indian
fishing
rights.
this
court
is
done
a
similar
thing
in
the
case
of
menominee
versus
united
states
at
391
u.s.
404
at
405,
406
implied
in
a
treaty
with
the
menominees
that
the
setting
aside
the
reservation
abuses
in
indian
reservation,
implicitly
gave
indian
fishing
rights.
a
second
basis
the
indians
claim
for
their
fishing
rights
is
18
u.s.c.
1165
which
vest
in
the
indians
the
absolute
right
to
determine
who
shall
fish
on
an
indian
reservation.
and
finally,
the
indians
in
this
case
claimed
that
there
is
an
implied
agreement
between
the
united
states
and
the
indians,
giving
them
fishing
rights
on
the
reservation
--
mr.
lee
j.
sclar
well
your
honor,
at
this
point,
we
do
not
claim
that.
this
man
was
not
fishing
for
commercial
purposes.
there
was
no
assertion
he
was
fishing
for
commercial
purposes.
the
question
isn’t
raise.
we
would
claim
that
there
are
commercial
fishing
rights
in
this
indians
that
when
congress
set
apart
the
reservation
originally
and
understood
--
mr.
lee
j.
sclar
just
for
personal
use,
for
family
use.
mr.
lee
j.
sclar
yes,
your
honor.
the
indians
had
historically
fished
that
way.
mr.
lee
j.
sclar
no.
mr.
lee
j.
sclar
yes,
your
honor.
i
mean,
i
was
answering
justice
white’s
question
merely.
it
is
not
before
this
court.
no,
your
honor.
mr.
lee
j.
sclar
that
is
correct
your
honor.
although
my
time
is
expired
your
honor,
would
it
be
possible
for
me
to
discuss
this
question
of
the
number
of
indians
living
on
the
reservation?
mr.
lee
j.
sclar
thank
you.
there
is
one
other
thing
justice
white
i
like
to
say,
that
fact
that
whether
the
river
bed
is
or
is
not
part
of
the
reservation
is
not
an
issue
which
i
believe
would
be
dispositive
of
the
case.
in
donnelly,
the
court
stated
that
it
assume
that
the
river
was
none
navigable
and
then
said
that
whether
or
not
the
river
was
navigable
in
fact,
its
bed
was
deemed
as
included
within
the
extension
of
the
hoopa
valley
reservation.
this
is
the
court
on
a
reconsideration
of
the
case
speaking
at
page
710.
mr.
lee
j.
sclar
in
addition
to
that,
i
would
point
out
that
these
nets
were
in
fact
seized
200
feet
from
the
river,
so
that
i
don’t
think
whether
the
rivers
included
would
solve
the
question.
i
asked
to
the
number
of
indians
living
on
the
reservation.
the
record
--
i
think
does
not
support
what
has
been
said.
40%
of
this
land
was
allotted
to
the
indians
of
this
reservation
and
in
addition,
the
indians
were
given
villages.
we
do
not
know
how
many
indians
lived
in
those
villages.
the
worst
statements
made
on
the
floor
of
congress
saying
that
there
were
only
40
to
60
indians
there,
but
i
think
those
were
--
the
remarks
rather
over
eager
promoters
of
the
settlers
interests
and
not
the
views
of
the
congress.
the
references
to
an
abandoned
reservation
in
the
house
where
repudiated
in
the
senate.
they
in
addition
were
clearly
referring
to
the
klamath
river
reservation
if
you
read
the
house
report
in
its
entirety,
you
see
that
the
words
“abandoned
reservation”
to
refer
reservation
abandoned
at
the
1860’s
and
they
talked
about
the
decision
if
forty-eight
pounds
of
rising
star
tea
which
is
the
decision
which
said
that
the
klamath
river
reservation
could
not
continue
to
exist
because
it
violated
the
1864
for
reservations
act.
they
where
not
talking
about
the
hoopa
extension
as
is
clear
by
the
fact
that
during
the
debates,
there
is
no
mention
of
the
hoopa
extension
and
in
fact,
the
--
at
two
points,
the
congress
indicated
they
didn’t
even
think
there
was
a
reservation
legally
in
this
area.
finally,
i
would
like
to
say
that
the
phrase
“what
was
the
klamath
river
reservation
in
this
act”
is
not
subject
to
conflicting
interest
of
interpretations.
i
have
never
suggested
that.
i
think
it’s
only
subject
to
one
inference,
and
that
is
that
the
klamath
river
reservation
was
dead
at
the
time
that
this
1892
act
was
passed
that
congress
knew
it
was
shown
in
house
act
and
have
been
held
so,
and
that
that
phrase
was
used
merely
to
describe
a
particular
portion
of
land,
not
to
have
any
tarnations
effect.
i
would
contrast
that
with
the
act
passed
two
weeks
later
relating
to
the
north
half
of
colville
which
said
that
this
reservation
is
here
by
vacated
and
restored
on
public
domain.
