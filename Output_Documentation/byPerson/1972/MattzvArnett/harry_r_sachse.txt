mr.
harry
r.
sachse
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
united
states
agrees
with
the
position
taken
by
mr.
sclar,
by
the
petitioner
in
this
case.
and
what
i
want
to
try
to
do
is
put
this
1892
act
into
a
little
bit
of
historical
perspective.
as
mr.
sclar
said,
the
yuroks
had
always
lived
in
that
area.
they
twice
had
had
their
reservation
recognized
by
executive
order
1855
and
1891.
the
1891
act
was
an
obvious
reaction
to
the
legal
problems
that
had
been
recognized
in
1889
court
of
appeals
case.
in
1892,
it
may
be
that
the
house
of
representatives
set
out
to
take
from
these
indians
much
of
what
had
been
theirs.
but
what
the
house
set
out
to
do,
the
senate
corrected
and
there’s
a
varied
market
contrast
between
the
bill
as
it
was
act
as
it
was
finally
passed.
and
the
act
as
it
was
introduced
it
the
house,
and
the
act
as
it
was
finally
passed
in
our
view
is
quite
clearly
a
special
allotment
act
similar
to
a
number
of
other
allotment
acts
that
was
passed
in
that
general
time,
and
which
did
not
terminate
the
reservation
in
question.
i’d
like
to
first
mention
something
about
the
general
allotment
acts.
i
think
that’s
important
than
this.
by
the
1880’s,
most
of
the
indian
reservations
had
been
created,
but
there
was
a
pressure
by
the
settlers
around
those
reservations
to
get
some
of
the
land
in
the
reservations
because
they
felt
the
indians
were
not
utilizing
that
land.
and
on
the
other
hand,
there
was
a
pressure
to
keep
faith
with
the
indians
and
not
to
take
from
them
what
had
recently
been
given
to
them.
a
sort
of
compromise
was
worked
out
in
the
general
allotment
act
in
1887
it’s
called
the
dawes
act.
it
subsequently
been
repudiated
in
the
indian
reorganization
act
in
1934.
the
dawes
act
setup
this
system
that
whenever
the
president
thought
it
was
wise
to
do
so,
he
could
require
all
the
indians
within
the
reservation
to
take
allotments
of
a
particular
number
of
acres
each.
this
would
usually
leave
considerable
land
in
the
reservation
that
was
not
allotted.
president
then
with
the
consent
of
the
indians
which
was
assumed
in
those
days
he
could
obtain
would
open
the
rest
of
the
reservation
for
homesteading.
but
the
fees
charged
to
the
homesteaders
would
be
used
for
the
benefit
of
the
indians
who
lived
on
the
reservation.
now,
that
was
the
general
allotment
act.
the
general
allotment
act
did
not
require
the
president
to
open
any
particular
reservation
in
this
way,
and
congress
passed
a
number
of
special
allotment
acts.
we’ve
listed
those
that
have
been
in
litigation
on
page
22
of
our
brief,
footnote
18.
the
special
allotment
acts
would
take
the
matter
out
of
the
hands
of
the
president
and
the
tribe
and
congress
would
say
“we
want
allotments
made
on
a
particular
piece
of
land.
we
want
--
once
the
allotments
are
made,
we
want
to
open
the
rest
of
it
to
settlement
and
we
want
the
funds
collected
from
the
settlers
to
be
administered
by
the
government
for
the
benefit
of
the
indians
that
lived
on
that
land.”
many
of
the
special
allotment
acts
made
a
particular
reference
to
the
general
allotment
acts,
saying
that
the
allotments
would
be
made
under
the
terms
of
the
general
allotment
act.
it’s
very
significant
that
the
funds
obtained
in
such
an
act
would
be
used
for
the
benefit
of
the
indians
who
remained
in
the
reservation,
and
this
matter
of
course
continued
federal
involvement
with
that
reservation,
both
in
handling
the
land
transactions
and
administering
the
funds
that
would
be
created
by
this
procedure.
in
our
view,
the
1892
klamath
river
act
is
that
kind
of
special
allotment
act,
and
in
our
brief
when
we
cited
the
language
of
the
act,
we
put
in
dark
provisions
that
part
added
by
the
senate
which
together
with
the
final
paragraph
that
been
there
all
along
make
this
act
exactly
a
special
allotment
act
of
the
area
of
that
reservation
that
was
affected.
now,
--
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
that’s
correct.
now,
this
court
early
acted
--
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
unless
congress
had
in
some
--
we
don’t
reach
that
issue
here
because
there
still
is
allotted
restricted
land
in
this
reservation.
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
well,
in
this
case,
this
court
in
donnelly
has
already
held
that
the
indians
owned
the
bed
of
that
river,
and
that
river
has
never
been
taken
from
them.
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
that’s
never
been
allotted
to
anybody.
that’s
still
communally
held
indian
land
as
far
as
we’re
concerned,
and
there’s
not
a
word
in
the
1892
act
to
take
that
away.
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
it’s
some
way
of
between
the
two.
they
were
ancestral
fishing
rights
but
this
court
in
donnelly
held
specifically
that
the
1891
extension
that
ran
snaking
20,
40
miles
down
the
river,
was
done
specifically
to
preserve
the
fishing
rights
that
the
indians
had
in
that
--
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
i
think
the
exclusive
right
to
fish
in
that
river?
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
since
it
was
made
an
indian
reservation,
the
purpose
of
which
is
that
this
area
is
to
be
reserved
for
the
indians,
and
since
all
that
was
--
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
--
surplus
lands
were
sold
but
nothing
was
done
to
take
it.
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
i
would
say,
yes
--
i
would
say
that
but
i
don’t
think
this
case
requires
it.
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
well,
here’s
the
way
i
would
analyze
this
case,
and
then
i
--
but
i
think
what
you’ve
raised
is
also
a
possible
analysis,
a
possible
way
to
handle
the
case.
the
1891
act
established
an
indian
reservation
for
a
mile
on
both
sides
of
the
river
including
the
river
and
going
all
the
way
down
to
the
sea.
this
court
in
donnelly
held
that
one
of
the
primary
purposes
of
establishing
that
reservation
was
to
secure
to
the
indians
the
fishing
rights
of
that
river.
that
reservation
has
never
been
abolished.
the
1892
act
which
let
other
people
than
indians
settle
in
this
area
while
preserving
also
indian
settlement
simply
did
not
abolish
the
reservation.
so
the
reservation
is
still
an
area
of
federal
jurisdiction
and
protection,
except
to
the
extent
that
public
law
280
has
given
the
state
of
california
certain
criminal
and
civil
jurisdiction
within
it,
but
public
law
280
specifically
reserves
federally
granted
fishing
rights,
and
these
were
granted
by
the
executive
order
as
this
court
held
in
donnelly.
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
we’ve
asked
--
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
that’s
correct.
and
we’ve
only
asked
this
court
to
determine
the
question
of
whether
this
remains
indian
country.
whether
this
remains
an
indian
reservation
with
the
remand
after
that
has
been
determined
to
the
california
courts.
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
i
don’t
think
it
would
be
irrelevant
because
i
think
it
would
matter
from
the
standpoint
of
criminal
and
civil
jurisdiction.
it
would
only
be
irrelevant
if
the
court
were
to
find
that
public
law
280
had
granted
such
total
jurisdiction
to
the
state
of
california
that
even
if
it
is
a
reservation
all
that
is
left
is
the
ownership
of
the
river.
so
i
think
that
it
still
is
relevant.
i’d
like
to
get
back
to
the
specific
point
that
this
court
is
faced
with,
and
that
is
has
this
allotment
process
terminated
the
reservation?
and
because
i’m
running
out
of
time,
i’ll
just
mention
this
very
quickly.
that
in
united
states
versus
celestine,
the
court
first
had
to
determine
this
problem
215
u.s.
and
in
that
case,
court
held
in
a
careful
opinion
that
the
general
allotment
act
is
inconsistent
with
termination
of
a
reservation
that
allotments
under
that
act
and
even
disposal
of
land
to
non-indians
does
not
terminate
a
reservation.
in
united
states
versus
nice,
at
241
u.s.,
these
are
all
in
our
brief.
the
court
held
that
a
special
allotment
act
should
be
interpreted
in
pari
materia
in
accordance
with
the
policy
of
the
general
allotment
act,
and
that
a
special
allotment
act
on
the
sioux
reservation,
though
it
required
the
sioux
to
take
on
that
reservation,
to
take
allotments,
required
the
president
to
dispose
of
the
extra
land,
did
not
terminate
federal
jurisdiction,
did
not
terminate
the
reservation,
did
not
terminate
federal
jurisdiction
even
as
to
the
land
that
was
disposed
of
to
non-indians.
this
same
policy
was
recognized
more
recently
by
this
court
in
seymour
versus
superintendent,
and
also
has
been
codified
by
congress
in
its
definition
of
indian
country,
as
including
all
the
land
within
the
boundaries
of
an
indian
reservation
whether
patented
or
allotted
or
not.
i
want
to
--
there’ve
been
two
very
recent
cases
we
mentioned
in
our
brief
also,
one
in
the
eighth
circuit,
city
of
new
town
and
another
one
the
supreme
court
of
south
dakota,
state
versus
molash
that
have
the
same
consistent
interpretation
of
special
allotment
acts
indistinguishable
from
this
1892
klamath
river
act.
and
in
closing,
i
would,
since
i
assume
i’m
out
of
time.
i
refer
the
court
to
page
17
of
our
brief
where
we
have
samples
of
language
that
congress
used
when
it
did
want
to
discontinue
a
portion
of
a
reservation.
“the
smith
river
reservation
is
hereby
discontinued”
congress
said,
or
“the
reservation
lands
of
the
ponca,
otoe
and
missouria
indian
reservations
be
and
they
are
hereby,
abolished.”
there’s
been
no
confusion
between
an
act
that
simply
opens
a
reservation
to
allotment
and
settlement,
and
one
that
abolishes
the
boundaries
of
a
reservation.
thank
you.
mr.
harry
r.

mr.

may
it

harry
r.
sachse
well,
here’s
the
way
i
would
analyze
this
case,
and
then
i
--
but
i
think
what
you’ve
raised
is
also
a
possible
analysis,
a
possible
way
to
handle
the
case.
the
1891
act
established
an
indian
reservation
for
a
mile
on
both
sides
of
the
river
including
the
river
and
going
all
the
way
down
to
the
sea.
this
court
in
donnelly
held
that
one
of
the
primary
purposes
of
establishing
that
reservation
was
to
secure
to
the
indians
the
fishing
rights
of
that
river.
that
reservation
has
never
been
abolished.
the
1892
act
which
let
other
people
than
indians
settle
in
this
area
while
preserving
also
indian
settlement
simply
did
not
abolish
the
reservation.
so
the
reservation
is
still
an
area
of
federal
jurisdiction
and
protection,
except
to
the
extent
that
public
law
280
has
given
the
state
of
california
certain
criminal
and
civil
jurisdiction
within
it,
but
public
law
280
specifically
reserves
federally
granted
fishing
rights,
and
these
were
granted
by
the
executive
order
as
this
court
held
in
donnelly.
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
we’ve
asked
--
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
that’s
correct.
and
we’ve
only
asked
this
court
to
determine
the
question
of
whether
this
remains
indian
country.
whether
this
remains
an
indian
reservation
with
the
remand
after
that
has
been
determined
to
the
california
courts.
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
i
don’t
think
it
would
be
irrelevant
because
i
think
it
would
matter
from
the
standpoint
of
criminal
and
civil
jurisdiction.
it
would
only
be
irrelevant
if
the
court
were
to
find
that
public
law
280
had
granted
such
total
jurisdiction
to
the
state
of
california
that
even
if
it
is
a
reservation
all
that
is
left
is
the
ownership
of
the
river.
so
i
think
that
it
still
is
relevant.
i’d
like
to
get
back
to
the
specific
point
that
this
court
is
faced
with,
and
that
is
has
this
allotment
process
terminated
the
reservation?
and
because
i’m
running
out
of
time,
i’ll
just
mention
this
very
quickly.
that
in
united
states
versus
celestine,
the
court
first
had
to
determine
this
problem
215
u.s.
and
in
that
case,
court
held
in
a
careful
opinion
that
the
general
allotment
act
is
inconsistent
with
termination
of
a
reservation
that
allotments
under
that
act
and
even
disposal
of
land
to
non-indians
does
not
terminate
a
reservation.
in
united
states
versus
nice,
at
241
u.s.,
these
are
all
in
our
brief.
the
court
held
that
a
special
allotment
act
should
be
interpreted
in
pari
materia
in
accordance
with
the
policy
of
the
general
allotment
act,
and
that
a
special
allotment
act
on
the
sioux
reservation,
though
it
required
the
sioux
to
take
on
that
reservation,
to
take
allotments,
required
the
president
to
dispose
of
the
extra
land,
did
not
terminate
federal
jurisdiction,
did
not
terminate
the
reservation,
did
not
terminate
federal
jurisdiction
even
as
to
the
land
that
was
disposed
of
to
non-indians.
this
same
policy
was
recognized
more
recently
by
this
court
in
seymour
versus
superintendent,
and
also
has
been
codified
by
congress
in
its
definition
of
indian
country,
as
including
all
the
land
within
the
boundaries
of
an
indian
reservation
whether
patented
or
allotted
or
not.
i
want
to
--
there’ve
been
two
very
recent
cases
we
mentioned
in
our
brief
also,
one
in
the
eighth
circuit,
city
of
new
town
and
another
one
the
supreme
court
of
south
dakota,
state
versus
molash
that
have
the
same
consistent
interpretation
of
special
allotment
acts
indistinguishable
from
this
1892
klamath
river
act.
and
in
closing,
i
would,
since
i
assume
i’m
out
of
time.
i
refer
the
court
to
page
17
of
our
brief
where
we
have
samples
of
language
that
congress
used
when
it
did
want
to
discontinue
a
portion
of
a
reservation.
“the
smith
river
reservation
is
hereby
discontinued”
congress
said,
or
“the
reservation
lands
of
the
ponca,
otoe
and
missouria
indian
reservations
be
and
they
are
hereby,
abolished.”
there’s
been
no
confusion
between
an
act
that
simply
opens
a
reservation
to
allotment
and
settlement,
and
one
that
abolishes
the
boundaries
of
a
reservation.
thank
you.
