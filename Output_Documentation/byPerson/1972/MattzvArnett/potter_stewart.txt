well,
i
thought
that
that
was
an
opening
question
according
to
the
government’s
brief,
is
that
the
only
question
we
have
here
is
the
preliminary
question
of
whether
or
not
this
is
or
is
not
indian
country?
justice
potter
stewart
and
the
court
--
your
state
court
held
that
it
was
not.
justice
potter
stewart
and
that
therefore,
there
was
no
question
of
any
conflict
this
which
just
the

--
the

have
normal
application
of
the

if
that

should
be
reversed
and
if
we
should
find
that

then
at

the

says
the
respective
right
of
the
state
to
enforce
its
fish
and
game
laws
and
its
conservation
laws
in
this
indian
country
is
a
non-resolve
issue
and
the
case
should
be
remanded
to
the
state
court
for
the
resolution
of
that
issue.
justice

am
i
mistaken
about
that?

the
question
that

not
reach.

it

we
