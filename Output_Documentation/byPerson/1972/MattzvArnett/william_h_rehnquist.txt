justice

rehnquist
mr.
walston,
let
me
ask
you
a
question
before
you
begin.
i
noticed
that
you
refer
the
several
maps
in
your
brief
in
the
government
and
your
opponent
referred
to
several
maps.
how
many
of
these
maps
where
placed
in
evidence
in
the
trial
court?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
when
you
have
a
case
involving
maps,
you
offer
him
an
evidence
and
this
probably
goes
to
your
opponent’s
case
as
much
as
to
yours.
you
offer
them
an
evidence
to
the
trial
court.
you
authenticate
them
in
some
way.
you
may
have
expert
testimony
as
to
the
how
credible
they
are.
i
have
some
difficulty
with
the
idea
that
this
court
should
simply
consider
a
bunch
of
maps
that
were
never
offered
to
the
trial
court.
