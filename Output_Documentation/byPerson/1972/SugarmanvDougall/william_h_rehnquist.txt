mr.
hirshowitz,
are
you
going
to
come
to
the
case
of
graham
against
richardson
which
i
guess
the
three-judge
district
court
below
relied
on?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
[voice
overlap]
even
the
language
of
the
fourteenth
amendment,
mr.
evens?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
one
factual
distinction
mr.
evens
is
that
your
clients
presumably
have
it
within
their
own
power
to
change
their
status,
don’t
they?
to
become
citizens
if
they
so
choose?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
evens,
one
of
the
fact
situations
you
described
is
that
of
mr.
dougall
who
plans
if
the
government
changes
in
guiana
to
return.
now,
isn’t
there
at
least
something
that
might
commend
itself
to
a
reasonable
legislature
in
the
argument,
that
here
is
a
man
who
we
can
provide
a
good
job
for
in
the
civil
service
who
we
could
expect
to
be
there
rather
indefinitely
if
we
kept
promoting
him
if
he
were
a
national
but
this
man
is
subject
to
a
--
you
know
in
his
eyes
very
legitimate
outside
poll
but
the
citizen
just
wouldn’t
be
subject
to?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
assuming
that
no
citizens
are
going
back
to
guiana?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
no,
but
most
people
haven’t
left
new
jersey
or
connecticut
to
come
to
new
york
as
political
refugees?
