mr.
samuel
a.
hirshowitz
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
involves
the
question
of
validity
of
a
section
of
the
new
york
state
civil
service
law
the
--
which
the
--
a
three-judge
district
court
held
invalid.
the
particular
language
that
the
court
dealt
with
is
found
on
page
91
of
the
record
in
a
footnote,
“except
as
herein
otherwise
provided,
no
person
shall
be
eligible
for
appointment
for
any
position
in
the
competitive
class
unless
he
is
a
citizen
of
the
united
states.”
there
is
a
second
subdivision
which
doesn’t
appear
in
the
record
but
which
is
discussed
in
the
opinion
which
provides
that
where
the
appointing
authority
cannot
find
any
person
to
fill
a
position,
he
may
apply
to
the
local
civil
service
commission
or
to
the
state
civil
service
commission
and
if
they
are
satisfied
that
there
is
no
one
available
for
that
position
they
may
certify
this
appointment
which
last
only
for
the
--
to
the
end
of
the
year
and
cannot
be
continued
unless
this
appointee
has
taken
steps
to
become
a
citizen
by
filing
a
declaration
of
intention.
the
particular
appellees
here
were
appointed
by
the
city
of
new
york
as
provisional
appointees.
that
means
they
never
took
any
examination.
as
provisionals
they
were
entitled
to
hold
their
position
at
the
discretion
of
the
appointing
authority
for
a
period
of
which
is
generally
regarded
as
nine
months
provided
that
there
was
no
eligible
list,
and
in
this
case
the
answer
of
the
city
of
new
york
shows
that
there
was
an
eligible
list
established
but
in
this
case,
the
appellees
would
terminate
it
not
because
of
the
existence
of
the
eligible
list
but
because
of
the
existence
of
this
statute
the
city
of
new
york
found
that
they
were
not
citizens.
the
civil
service
system
in
new
york
as
this
court
knows
is
based
on
the
merit
system
and
the
competitive
class
which
is
established
after
examination
and
qualifications.
one
who
is
appointed
after
examination
obtains
rights
of
tenure,
seniority
and
promotional
preferences
together
with
pension
benefits.
the
appellees
have
been
residents
according
to
their
affidavits
have
been
residents
in
the
city
of
new
york
for
varying
years.
some
six
years,
some
ten
years
and
none
of
them
have
taken
even
the
first
step
to
obtain
citizenship.
the
first
appellee,
mc
dougall
for
instance
was
a
resident
to
the
city
of
new
york
since
1964
and
never
took
any
steps
to
become
a
citizen.
none
of
the
appellees,
because
of
a
question
of
preemption
which
will
be
discussed,
none
of
the
appellees
were
ever
certified
by
united
states
secretary
of
labor
for
the
position
he
or
she
was
filling.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
mc
dougall
was
the
only
one
that
took
an
examination.
and
let
me
point
out
that
prior
to
1968,
the
statute
which
i
read
provided
that
nobody
could
take
an
examination
for
our
position
but
that
was
altered
and
amended
to
provide
that
no
one
could
be
appointed.
the
difference
being
that
one
who
is
an
alien
could
take
the
examination
and
the
meantime
take
steps
to
become
a
citizen
as
the
usual
process
that
takes
from
six
months
to
a
year
before
the
examinations
are
marked
and
a
list
established,
and
the
list
one
established
is
usually
good
for
varying
period
of
three
to
five
years.
the
district
court
in
this
case
sustained
the
appellee’s
challenge
on
both
equal
protection
and
supremacy
clause
grounds
relying
principally
on
a
case
decided
by
this
court,
graham
against
richardson
which
we
are
sure
was
misapplied.
the
graham
case
has
spawned
a
flock
of
litigation
in
various
federal
courts
throughout
the
land.
according
to
our
computation,
there
are
seven
cases
in
various
federal
courts
and
various
stages
of
litigation
raising
questions
as
to
the
validity
of
discrimination
against
aliens.
let
me
also
point
out
that
the
federal
government
has
a
quibbling
practice
which
is
as
a
result
of
authority
given
to
this
civil
service
commission
to
establish
the
conditions
of
employment
and
by
executive
order
aliens
have
been
barred
from
united
states
employment
except
the
same
way
as
new
york
does.
certification
where
there's
no
available
employee.
the
--
in
addition
to
that,
congress
in
the
annual
appropriation
bills
has
specifically
provided
that
no
payment
of
compensation
can
be
made
to
an
employee
if
he
is
not
a
citizen
of
the
united
states.
that
is
an
employee
on
american
soil.
a
copy
of
the
federal
provision,
we
have
attached
to
our
brief
as
exhibit
1.
and
in
this
court
here,
the
appellees
have
persisted
in
the
claim
at
the
right
to
travel
of
the
aliens
as
being
interfered
with
as
if
they
ever
posses
such
right
which
is
important
in
part
in
this
case
and
they
have
apparently,
as
we
read
their
briefs,
argued
that
the
statute
is
overbroad
which
was
not
a
contention
what
was
made
below.
in
the
sense
that
the
lower
grade
of
employees
should
not
be
barred
by
this
statutory
provision
but
the
higher
grade
employees
may
be
barred.
the
first
question
that
suggests
itself
is
whether
there
is
any
equation
of
equal
protection
available
to
the
appellees
whether
the
court
was
right
in
considering
equal
protection
at
all.
we
suggest
that
his
very
precedent
and
principle
required
this
court
to
hold
that
the
states
have
not
been
by
divested
of
the
power
to
limits
its
public
employees
as
citizens.
and
that
this
power
is
not
affected
by
equal
protection
clause
of
the
constitution.
this
does
not
involved
the
consideration
of
the
question
of
rights
or
privileges
which
is
being
blurred
by
the
decisions
of
this
court
by
the
question
of
any
entitlement
at
all
to
consideration
for
employment,
public
employment.
the
question
was
on
the
consideration
in
the
crane
against
united
states
and
in
that
case
this
court
held
valid
new
york
state
statute
which
provided
at
that
time
that
employment
on
perfect
contracts
could
be
limited
to
citizens.
and
the
question
that
to
state
the
court
in
the
discussion
was
a
question
not
whether
public
employment
could
be
limited
to
citizens
but
as
to
whether
the
public
contractors
were
in
effect
the
government
when
engage
in
public
contracts.
the
district
court
relied
to
some
extent
on
the
truax
case
which
was
decided
by
the
same
court
at
the
same
time
and
in
the
same
volume
of
the
reports.
in
the
truax
case,
the
court
struck
down
an
arizona
statute
that
forbids
the
employment
of
aliens
generally.
at
the
same
time,
it
was
very
careful
to
point
out
in
its
opinion
that
it
did
not
--
that
that
case
did
not
involved
the
appointment
of
citizens
in
public
employment.
in
the
crane
on
the
question
of
equal
protection
the
court
concluded
what
the
words
--
there
is
added
a
view
that
a
distinction
between
aliens
and
citizens
violates
the
principles
of
classifications.
we
think
this
is
also
without
foundation.
and
in
the
truax
case,
chief
justice
hughes
said,
that
the
challenge
here
is
not
limited
to
persons
who
are
engaged
in
public
work
but
that
have
passed
from
the
employment
in
the
entire
field
of
the
industry
in
all
common
occupations.
the
crane
case
came
from
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
and
judge
cardozo
who
later
said
on
this
court,
distinguished
the
truax
situation
and
the
crane
situation
in
this
way.
it
must
be
evident
that
nothing
in
this
opinion
gives
confidence
to
the
view
that
the
government
may
deny
to
aliens
the
right
to
engaged
in
any
private
trade
or
calling
on
times
of
equality
with
citizens.
it
is
true
that
in
dealings
between
man
and
man,
the
alien
and
the
citizen
trade
labor
on
equal
terms.
it
is
the
denial
of
equal
protection
of
laws
when
the
government
in
its
capacity
as
lawmaker
regulating
not
its
own
property
but
private
business
bars
the
alien
from
the
right
to
trade
and
labor.
it
is
therefore
our
contention
that
the
crane
case
in
its
present
under
the
facts
in
this
case
is
authoritative,
this
position
by
this
court
for
the
view
that
the
equal
protection
clause
does
not
apply.
mr.
samuel
a.
hirshowitz
it
does
not
apply
to
aliens
seeking
to
obtain
public
employment.
mr.
samuel
a.
hirshowitz
the
equal
protection
clause
of
course
is
applicable
to
the
state.
but
in
the
--
on
the
question
of
whether
aliens
entitled
to
public
employment,
it’s
our
first
position
that
the
equal
protection
clause
does
not
apply
because
of
the
tenth
amendment
constitution.
when
the
constitution
was
adopted
from
historic
times,
the
states
were
obtained
and
continued
with
the
right
to
run
their
own
government
except
in
so
far
as
expressly
interfered
with
by
the
united
states
constitution
and
there's
nothing
in
united
states
constitution
and
it
would
appear
to
me
to
do
a
violence
to
the
government
of
the
states
or
either
by
judicial
decree
or
congressional
act
to
interfere
with
the
government
to
the
states
and
to
provide
that
aliens
must
be
employed
by
the
states.
now,
this
is
not
a
novel
in
oregon
against
mitchell,
chief
justice
black
in
discussing
the
18-year-old
vote
case.
it
said
in
part,
“it
cannot
be
successfully
argued
that
the
fourteenth
amendment
was
intended
to
strip
the
states
of
their
power,
carefully
preserved
in
the
original
constitution,
to
govern
themselves.
the
fourteenth
amendment
was
surely
not
intended
to
make
every
discrimination
between
groups
of
people
a
constitutional
denial
of
equal
protection.”
and
in
the
maryland
against
wirtz,
justice
--
mr.
justice
douglas
said
in
connection
with
the
bill
which
--
a
law
which
as
this
court
will
remember
dealt
with
minimum
wages
of
certain
classes
of
state
employees.
mr.
justice
douglas
said
in
his
dissent
that
it
would
snuff
out
state’s
sovereignty.
“if
all
this
can
be
done,
then
the
national
government
could
devour
the
essentials
of
state
sovereignty,
though,
that
sovereignty
is
attested
by
the
tenth
amendment.”
and
then
he
went
on
to
quote
mr.
justice
stone
in
the
case
new
york
against
united
states
where
chief
justice
stone
said,
“the
national
government
may
not
interfere
unduly
with
the
state’s
performance
of
its
sovereign,
sovereign
functions
of
government.
it
may
not
impair
this
state’s
function
of
government.”
now,
below
the
three-judge-court
in
its
opinion
disregard
the
fact
that
the
--
this
country
and
its
various
subdivisions
is
not
only
a
government
of
the
people,
it’s
a
government
by
the
people.
and
by
the
people
means,
the
citizens
of
this
land
and
this
includes
--
this
excludes
the
right
to
compel
aliens
to
be
employed
by
the
state
or
its
subdivisions.
mr.
samuel
a.
hirshowitz
graham
against
the
richardson
did
not
involve
any
practice
in
new
york.
new
york
as
some
paper
show
has
paid
welfare
to
aliens
from
the
beginning
of
the
welfare
system.
as
we
read
the
graham
case,
this
court
was
dealing
with
indigents
and
that
case
there
the
state
involved
was
just
trying
to
establish
a
crude
economic
preference.
citizen
was
being
provided
when
the
necessities
of
life
while
the
alien
was
not.
although,
the
alien’s
status
bears
absolutely
no
relationship
to
the
alien’s
needs
as
a
recipient
or
to
his
contributions
as
a
taxpayer.
in
contrast
to
welfare,
section
53,
the
statute
on
the
discussion
has
concerned
solely
with
maintaining
the
national
character
and
the
integrity
and
efficiency
of
the
career
civil
service.
now,
even
if
this
court
holds
that
equal
protection
was
properly
made
an
issue
below,
its
opposition
that
the
right
of
the
state
to
run
its
government
by
its
own
citizens
by
itself
find
issues,
sufficient
basis
whatever
tests
of
equal
protection
is
applicable.
all
nations
and
states
conduct
their
affairs
through
the
agency
of
public
employees
and
thus,
practically
every
nation
and
state
requires
its
agents
including
the
career
civil
service
be
citizens.
as
this
court
recognize
in
such
cases
as
afroyim
against
rusk,
citizens
not
aliens
are
members
of
state.
mr.
samuel
a.
hirshowitz
there
are
three
grades
of
employment
under
new
york
states
civil
service
and
i
think
it
is
generally
the
rule.
you
have
the
competitive
class
where
appointments
are
made
after
examination,
and
then
there
is
the
exempt
class
or
exempt
category
where
appointments
had
been
–
may
be
made
by
the
appointing
law
officer
without
regard
to
examinations,
and
then
there's
the
noncompetitive
class,
where
as
a
position
of
unusual
character
which
--
from
which
examination
cannot
provide
the
suitable
employee.
mr.
samuel
a.
hirshowitz
it
is
for
residents,
yes.
mr.
samuel
a.
hirshowitz
every
employee
of
the
city
must
be
a
citizen
unless
as
i
said
coming
within
the
exceptions
of
certification
and
incidentally
they’ve
only
been
in
the
city
of
the
new
york,
they’ve
been
only
27
certifications
of
waiver
of
this
citizenship
requirement.
but
it
does
make
any
difference,
i
think
in
the
mitchell
case
there.
this
court
said
it
was
difficult,
almost
impossible
to
draw
a
distinction
between
various
grades
of
employees.
the
clerk
that’s
in
the
village
office
and
takes
your
tax
receipt,
as
far
as
the
public
is
concerned,
he
or
she
is
government
and
were
entitled
to
insist
that
such
employees
be
citizen
of
united
states.
in
addition
to
which
a
career
employee
who
starts
at
the
bottom
level
under
the
merit
system
in
new
york
is
entitled
to
promotion
and
the
same
person
who
starts
at
the
bottom
level
as
a
garage
collection
--
a
garbage
collector
would
be
entitled
to
take
the
examination
and
be
appointed
to
the
senior
position
up
to
the
top
there's
no
way
of
stopping
that.
it’s
been
suggested
by
our
opposition
as
i
said
towards
the
beginning,
that
maybe
the
bottom
garbage
collector
as
far
as
he
is
concerned,
the
law
is
bad
with
that
promotion
opportunities
should
be
precluded
for
aliens,
for
that
would
be
in
violation
of
the
whole
civil
service
system.
mr.
samuel
a.
hirshowitz
i
don’t
know
--
i
don’t
think
they
did
the
--
lumbard
--
judge
lumbard
was
troubled
by
the
decision.
as
i’ve
indicated
there,
he
was
troubled
by
the
fact
that
there
are
many
positions
in
the
higher
level
in
the
civil
service
system
that
he
himself
conceded
should
be
kept
only
for
citizens.
in
his
final
rationalized
that
but
that
would
mean
if
you
follow
judge
lumbard,
you
would
have
to
need
the
individual
case
justify
the
preclusion
of
alien.
i
want
to
say
i'm
worried
about
the
preemption.
the
second
ground
upon
which
the
district
court
relied
for
its
decision
was
a
question
of
preemption
and
that
was
discussed
in
the
graham
case
also.
but
let
me
point
out
that
none
of
the
appellees
were
ever
certified
by
the
united
states
secretary
of
labor
for
these
particular
positions,
so
that
the
claim
that
a
certification
by
united
states
secretary
of
labor
somehow
interfered
with
the
validity
of
the
statute
has
no
basis
in
fact.
the
secretary
of
labor
certifies
all
immigrants
only
upon
entrance
pursuant
to
the
statute.
these
certifications
do
not
purport
to
cover
public
employment
at
all
and
i've
read
the
minutes
of
the
congressional
hearings
both
for
reference
to
the
1952
law
and
the
revision
of
1965,
and
nowhere
is
there
any
indication
that
congress
intended
by
the
law
to
cover
public
employment.
we
think
that
the
statute
is
entitled
to
the
presumption
of
constitutionality
that
was
accorded
to
the
congressional
act
in
the
oregon
against
mitchell
case.
and
we
submit
that
the
civil
service
employee
who’s
an
alien
would
present
special
problems
to
the
state
and
to
the
federal
government.
in
rogers
against
bellei
which
was
recently
decided
by
this
court,
this
court
referred
to
the
problems
that
arise
from
dual
nationalities
there.
and
judge
--
and
referred
to
a
case
by
mr.
justice
douglas
in
which
he
said,
“one
who
has
a
dual
nationality
would
be
subject
to
claims
from
both
nations,
claims
which
at
times
may
be
competing
or
conflicting
that
circumstances
may
compel
one
who
has
the
dual
nationality
to
truax
which
would
not
be
compatible
with
the
obligations
of
american
citizenship.”
mr.
samuel
a.
hirshowitz
it
does,
your
honor.
it
applies
to
--
mr.
samuel
a.
hirshowitz
not
so
long
ago
in
lerner
against
casey.
this
court
held
that
--
mr.
samuel
a.
hirshowitz
the
trash
collector
could
create
as
much
problems
as
the
conductor
in
lerner
against
casey
where
this
court
held
that
a
subway
conductor
was
obligated
to
fill
out
a
loyalty
of
the
--
where
do
you
stop
when
--
mr.
samuel
a.
hirshowitz
now,
truax
against
raich
merely
held
as
i
have
pointed
out
that
applies
to
persons
in
common
occupations
and
as
i
indicated
--
mr.
samuel
a.
hirshowitz
no,
sir.
mr.
samuel
a.
hirshowitz
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
samuel
a.
hirshowitz
no,
problem
at
all
because
it
is
the
--
that
is
the
way
this
country
once
said
this
country
could
not
be
run
by
aliens
and
addition
to
what's
the
--
and
mr.
justice
marshall
--
mr.
samuel
a.
hirshowitz
any
person
--
mr.
samuel
a.
hirshowitz
yes.
in
any
case,
you
can
pick
at
random
situations.
but
the
fact
is
that
all
employees
should
be
citizens
and
it
doesn’t
present
any
part
to
them
from
employment.
now,
these
people
here
who
had
been
in
the
new
york
city
at
least
six
to
ten
years
made
no
effort
to
become
citizens
here.
it’s
no
problem
to
them
whether
its
trash
collectors
or
whether
in
this
case
mc
dougall
was
a
senior,
had
a
senior
job
officer
--
in
the
poverty
program.
let
me
also
study
mr.
justice
marshall
that
the
state
of
new
york
in
the
city
of
new
york
is
now
engaged
in
trying
to
reevaluate
the
merit
system
in
order
to
provide
a
better
means
of
testing
the
entrance
of
a
million
in
a
half
puerto
ricans,
about
two
million
black
citizens
in
the
competitive
class
system.
mr.
samuel
a.
hirshowitz
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
involves
the
question
of
validity
of
a
section
of
the
new
york
state
civil
service
law
the
--
which
the
--
a
three-judge
district
court
held
invalid.
the
particular
language
that
the
court
dealt
with
is
found
on
page
91
of
the
record
in
a
footnote,
“except
as
herein
otherwise
provided,
no
person
shall
be
eligible
for
appointment
for
any
position
in
the
competitive
class
unless
he
is
a
citizen
of
the
united
states.”
there
is
a
second
subdivision
which
doesn’t
appear
in
the
record
but
which
is
discussed
in
the
opinion
which
provides
that
where
the
appointing
authority
cannot
find
any
person
to
fill
a
position,
he
may
apply
to
the
local
civil
service
commission
or
to
the
state
civil
service
commission
and
if
they
are
satisfied
that
there
is
no
one
available
for
that
position
they
may
certify
this
appointment
which
last
only
for
the
--
to
the
end
of
the
year
and
cannot
be
continued
unless
this
appointee
has
taken
steps
to
become
a
citizen
by
filing
a
declaration
of
intention.
the
particular
appellees
here
were
appointed
by
the
city
of
new
york
as
provisional
appointees.
that
means
they
never
took
any
examination.
as
provisionals
they
were
entitled
to
hold
their
position
at
the
discretion
of
the
appointing
authority
for
a
period
of
which
is
generally
regarded
as
nine
months
provided
that
there
was
no
eligible
list,
and
in
this
case
the
answer
of
the
city
of
new
york
shows
that
there
was
an
eligible
list
established
but
in
this
case,
the
appellees
would
terminate
it
not
because
of
the
existence
of
the
eligible
list
but
because
of
the
existence
of
this
statute
the
city
of
new
york
found
that
they
were
not
citizens.
the
civil
service
system
in
new
york
as
this
court
knows
is
based
on
the
merit
system
and
the
competitive
class
which
is
established
after
examination
and
qualifications.
one
who
is
appointed
after
examination
obtains
rights
of
tenure,
seniority
and
promotional
preferences
together
with
pension
benefits.
the
appellees
have
been
residents
according
to
their
affidavits
have
been
residents
in
the
city
of
new
york
for
varying
years.
some
six
years,
some
ten
years
and
none
of
them
have
taken
even
the
first
step
to
obtain
citizenship.
the
first
appellee,
mc
dougall
for
instance
was
a
resident
to
the
city
of
new
york
since
1964
and
never
took
any
steps
to
become
a
citizen.
none
of
the
appellees,
because
of
a
question
of
preemption
which
will
be
discussed,
none
of
the
appellees
were
ever
certified
by
united
states
secretary
of
labor
for
the
position
he
or
she
was
filling.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
mc
dougall
was
the
only
one
that
took
an
examination.
and
let
me
point
out
that
prior
to
1968,
the
statute
which
i
read
provided
that
nobody
could
take
an
examination
for
our
position
but
that
was
altered
and
amended
to
provide
that
no
one
could
be
appointed.
the
difference
being
that
one
who
is
an
alien
could
take
the
examination
and
the
meantime
take
steps
to
become
a
citizen
as
the
usual
process
that
takes
from
six
months
to
a
year
before
the
examinations
are
marked
and
a
list
established,
and
the
list
one
established
is
usually
good
for
varying
period
of
three
to
five
years.
the
district
court
in
this
case
sustained
the
appellee’s
challenge
on
both
equal
protection
and
supremacy
clause
grounds
relying
principally
on
a
case
decided
by
this
court,
graham
against
richardson
which
we
are
sure
was
misapplied.
the
graham
case
has
spawned
a
flock
of
litigation
in
various
federal
courts
throughout
the
land.
according
to
our
computation,
there
are
seven
cases
in
various
federal
courts
and
various
stages
of
litigation
raising
questions
as
to
the
validity
of
discrimination
against
aliens.
let
me
also
point
out
that
the
federal
government
has
a
quibbling
practice
which
is
as
a
result
of
authority
given
to
this
civil
service
commission
to
establish
the
conditions
of
employment
and
by
executive
order
aliens
have
been
barred
from
united
states
employment
except
the
same
way
as
new
york
does.
certification
where
there's
no
available
employee.
the
--
in
addition
to
that,
congress
in
the
annual
appropriation
bills
has
specifically
provided
that
no
payment
of
compensation
can
be
made
to
an
employee
if
he
is
not
a
citizen
of
the
united
states.
that
is
an
employee
on
american
soil.
a
copy
of
the
federal
provision,
we
have
attached
to
our
brief
as
exhibit
1.
and
in
this
court
here,
the
appellees
have
persisted
in
the
claim
at
the
right
to
travel
of
the
aliens
as
being
interfered
with
as
if
they
ever
posses
such
right
which
is
important
in
part
in
this
case
and
they
have
apparently,
as
we
read
their
briefs,
argued
that
the
statute
is
overbroad
which
was
not
a
contention
what
was
made
below.
in
the
sense
that
the
lower
grade
of
employees
should
not
be
barred
by
this
statutory
provision
but
the
higher
grade
employees
may
be
barred.
the
first
question
that
suggests
itself
is
whether
there
is
any
equation
of
equal
protection
available
to
the
appellees
whether
the
court
was
right
in
considering
equal
protection
at
all.
we
suggest
that
his
very
precedent
and
principle
required
this
court
to
hold
that
the
states
have
not
been
by
divested
of
the
power
to
limits
its
public
employees
as
citizens.
and
that
this
power
is
not
affected
by
equal
protection
clause
of
the
constitution.
this
does
not
involved
the
consideration
of
the
question
of
rights
or
privileges
which
is
being
blurred
by
the
decisions
of
this
court
by
the
question
of
any
entitlement
at
all
to
consideration
for
employment,
public
employment.
the
question
was
on
the
consideration
in
the
crane
against
united
states
and
in
that
case
this
court
held
valid
new
york
state
statute
which
provided
at
that
time
that
employment
on
perfect
contracts
could
be
limited
to
citizens.
and
the
question
that
to
state
the
court
in
the
discussion
was
a
question
not
whether
public
employment
could
be
limited
to
citizens
but
as
to
whether
the
public
contractors
were
in
effect
the
government
when
engage
in
public
contracts.
the
district
court
relied
to
some
extent
on
the
truax
case
which
was
decided
by
the
same
court
at
the
same
time
and
in
the
same
volume
of
the
reports.
in
the
truax
case,
the
court
struck
down
an
arizona
statute
that
forbids
the
employment
of
aliens
generally.
at
the
same
time,
it
was
very
careful
to
point
out
in
its
opinion
that
it
did
not
--
that
that
case
did
not
involved
the
appointment
of
citizens
in
public
employment.
in
the
crane
on
the
question
of
equal
protection
the
court
concluded
what
the
words
--
there
is
added
a
view
that
a
distinction
between
aliens
and
citizens
violates
the
principles
of
classifications.
we
think
this
is
also
without
foundation.
and
in
the
truax
case,
chief
justice
hughes
said,
that
the
challenge
here
is
not
limited
to
persons
who
are
engaged
in
public
work
but
that
have
passed
from
the
employment
in
the
entire
field
of
the
industry
in
all
common
occupations.
the
crane
case
came
from
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
and
judge
cardozo
who
later
said
on
this
court,
distinguished
the
truax
situation
and
the
crane
situation
in
this
way.
it
must
be
evident
that
nothing
in
this
opinion
gives
confidence
to
the
view
that
the
government
may
deny
to
aliens
the
right
to
engaged
in
any
private
trade
or
calling
on
times
of
equality
with
citizens.
it
is
true
that
in
dealings
between
man
and
man,
the
alien
and
the
citizen
trade
labor
on
equal
terms.
it
is
the
denial
of
equal
protection
of
laws
when
the
government
in
its
capacity
as
lawmaker
regulating
not
its
own
property
but
private
business
bars
the
alien
from
the
right
to
trade
and
labor.
it
is
therefore
our
contention
that
the
crane
case
in
its
present
under
the
facts
in
this
case
is
authoritative,
this
position
by
this
court
for
the
view
that
the
equal
protection
clause
does
not
apply.
mr.
samuel
a.
hirshowitz
it
does
not
apply
to
aliens
seeking
to
obtain
public
employment.
mr.
samuel
a.
hirshowitz
the
equal
protection
clause
of
course
is
applicable
to
the
state.
but
in
the
--
on
the
question
of
whether
aliens
entitled
to
public
employment,
it’s
our
first
position
that
the
equal
protection
clause
does
not
apply
because
of
the
tenth
amendment
constitution.
when
the
constitution
was
adopted
from
historic
times,
the
states
were
obtained
and
continued
with
the
right
to
run
their
own
government
except
in
so
far
as
expressly
interfered
with
by
the
united
states
constitution
and
there's
nothing
in
united
states
constitution
and
it
would
appear
to
me
to
do
a
violence
to
the
government
of
the
states
or
either
by
judicial
decree
or
congressional
act
to
interfere
with
the
government
to
the
states
and
to
provide
that
aliens
must
be
employed
by
the
states.
now,
this
is
not
a
novel
in
oregon
against
mitchell,
chief
justice
black
in
discussing
the
18-year-old
vote
case.
it
said
in
part,
“it
cannot
be
successfully
argued
that
the
fourteenth
amendment
was
intended
to
strip
the
states
of
their
power,
carefully
preserved
in
the
original
constitution,
to
govern
themselves.
the
fourteenth
amendment
was
surely
not
intended
to
make
every
discrimination
between
groups
of
people
a
constitutional
denial
of
equal
protection.”
and
in
the
maryland
against
wirtz,
justice
--
mr.
justice
douglas
said
in
connection
with
the
bill
which
--
a
law
which
as
this
court
will
remember
dealt
with
minimum
wages
of
certain
classes
of
state
employees.
mr.
justice
douglas
said
in
his
dissent
that
it
would
snuff
out
state’s
sovereignty.
“if
all
this
can
be
done,
then
the
national
government
could
devour
the
essentials
of
state
sovereignty,
though,
that
sovereignty
is
attested
by
the
tenth
amendment.”
and
then
he
went
on
to
quote
mr.
justice
stone
in
the
case
new
york
against
united
states
where
chief
justice
stone
said,
“the
national
government
may
not
interfere
unduly
with
the
state’s
performance
of
its
sovereign,
sovereign
functions
of
government.
it
may
not
impair
this
state’s
function
of
government.”
now,
below
the
three-judge-court
in
its
opinion
disregard
the
fact
that
the
--
this
country
and
its
various
subdivisions
is
not
only
a
government
of
the
people,
it’s
a
government
by
the
people.
and
by
the
people
means,
the
citizens
of
this
land
and
this
includes
--
this
excludes
the
right
to
compel
aliens
to
be
employed
by
the
state
or
its
subdivisions.
mr.
samuel
a.
hirshowitz
graham
against
the
richardson
did
not
involve
any
practice
in
new
york.
new
york
as
some
paper
show
has
paid
welfare
to
aliens
from
the
beginning
of
the
welfare
system.
as
we
read
the
graham
case,
this
court
was
dealing
with
indigents
and
that
case
there
the
state
involved
was
just
trying
to
establish
a
crude
economic
preference.
citizen
was
being
provided
when
the
necessities
of
life
while
the
alien
was
not.
although,
the
alien’s
status
bears
absolutely
no
relationship
to
the
alien’s
needs
as
a
recipient
or
to
his
contributions
as
a
taxpayer.
in
contrast
to
welfare,
section
53,
the
statute
on
the
discussion
has
concerned
solely
with
maintaining
the
national
character
and
the
integrity
and
efficiency
of
the
career
civil
service.
now,
even
if
this
court
holds
that
equal
protection
was
properly
made
an
issue
below,
its
opposition
that
the
right
of
the
state
to
run
its
government
by
its
own
citizens
by
itself
find
issues,
sufficient
basis
whatever
tests
of
equal
protection
is
applicable.
all
nations
and
states
conduct
their
affairs
through
the
agency
of
public
employees
and
thus,
practically
every
nation
and
state
requires
its
agents
including
the
career
civil
service
be
citizens.
as
this
court
recognize
in
such
cases
as
afroyim
against
rusk,
citizens
not
aliens
are
members
of
state.
mr.
samuel
a.
hirshowitz
there
are
three
grades
of
employment
under
new
york
states
civil
service
and
i
think
it
is
generally
the
rule.
you
have
the
competitive
class
where
appointments
are
made
after
examination,
and
then
there
is
the
exempt
class
or
exempt
category
where
appointments
had
been
–
may
be
made
by
the
appointing
law
officer
without
regard
to
examinations,
and
then
there's
the
noncompetitive
class,
where
as
a
position
of
unusual
character
which
--
from
which
examination
cannot
provide
the
suitable
employee.
mr.
samuel
a.
hirshowitz
it
is
for
residents,
yes.
mr.
samuel
a.
hirshowitz
every
employee
of
the
city
must
be
a
citizen
unless
as
i
said
coming
within
the
exceptions
of
certification
and
incidentally
they’ve
only
been
in
the
city
of
the
new
york,
they’ve
been
only
27
certifications
of
waiver
of
this
citizenship
requirement.
but
it
does
make
any
difference,
i
think
in
the
mitchell
case
there.
this
court
said
it
was
difficult,
almost
impossible
to
draw
a
distinction
between
various
grades
of
employees.
the
clerk
that’s
in
the
village
office
and
takes
your
tax
receipt,
as
far
as
the
public
is
concerned,
he
or
she
is
government
and
were
entitled
to
insist
that
such
employees
be
citizen
of
united
states.
in
addition
to
which
a
career
employee
who
starts
at
the
bottom
level
under
the
merit
system
in
new
york
is
entitled
to
promotion
and
the
same
person
who
starts
at
the
bottom
level
as
a
garage
collection
--
a
garbage
collector
would
be
entitled
to
take
the
examination
and
be
appointed
to
the
senior
position
up
to
the
top
there's
no
way
of
stopping
that.
it’s
been
suggested
by
our
opposition
as
i
said
towards
the
beginning,
that
maybe
the
bottom
garbage
collector
as
far
as
he
is
concerned,
the
law
is
bad
with
that
promotion
opportunities
should
be
precluded
for
aliens,
for
that
would
be
in
violation
of
the
whole
civil
service
system.
mr.
samuel
a.
hirshowitz
i
don’t
know
--
i
don’t
think
they
did
the
--
lumbard
--
judge
lumbard
was
troubled
by
the
decision.
as
i’ve
indicated
there,
he
was
troubled
by
the
fact
that
there
are
many
positions
in
the
higher
level
in
the
civil
service
system
that
he
himself
conceded
should
be
kept
only
for
citizens.
in
his
final
rationalized
that
but
that
would
mean
if
you
follow
judge
lumbard,
you
would
have
to
need
the
individual
case
justify
the
preclusion
of
alien.
i
want
to
say
i'm
worried
about
the
preemption.
the
second
ground
upon
which
the
district
court
relied
for
its
decision
was
a
question
of
preemption
and
that
was
discussed
in
the
graham
case
also.
but
let
me
point
out
that
none
of
the
appellees
were
ever
certified
by
the
united
states
secretary
of
labor
for
these
particular
positions,
so
that
the
claim
that
a
certification
by
united
states
secretary
of
labor
somehow
interfered
with
the
validity
of
the
statute
has
no
basis
in
fact.
the
secretary
of
labor
certifies
all
immigrants
only
upon
entrance
pursuant
to
the
statute.
these
certifications
do
not
purport
to
cover
public
employment
at
all
and
i've
read
the
minutes
of
the
congressional
hearings
both
for
reference
to
the
1952
law
and
the
revision
of
1965,
and
nowhere
is
there
any
indication
that
congress
intended
by
the
law
to
cover
public
employment.
we
think
that
the
statute
is
entitled
to
the
presumption
of
constitutionality
that
was
accorded
to
the
congressional
act
in
the
oregon
against
mitchell
case.
and
we
submit
that
the
civil
service
employee
who’s
an
alien
would
present
special
problems
to
the
state
and
to
the
federal
government.
in
rogers
against
bellei
which
was
recently
decided
by
this
court,
this
court
referred
to
the
problems
that
arise
from
dual
nationalities
there.
and
judge
--
and
referred
to
a
case
by
mr.
justice
douglas
in
which
he
said,
“one
who
has
a
dual
nationality
would
be
subject
to
claims
from
both
nations,
claims
which
at
times
may
be
competing
or
conflicting
that
circumstances
may
compel
one
who
has
the
dual
nationality
to
truax
which
would
not
be
compatible
with
the
obligations
of
american
citizenship.”
mr.
samuel
a.
hirshowitz
it
does,
your
honor.
it
applies
to
--
mr.
samuel
a.
hirshowitz
not
so
long
ago
in
lerner
against
casey.
this
court
held
that
--
mr.
samuel
a.
hirshowitz
the
trash
collector
could
create
as
much
problems
as
the
conductor
in
lerner
against
casey
where
this
court
held
that
a
subway
conductor
was
obligated
to
fill
out
a
loyalty
of
the
--
where
do
you
stop
when
--
mr.
samuel
a.
hirshowitz
now,
truax
against
raich
merely
held
as
i
have
pointed
out
that
applies
to
persons
in
common
occupations
and
as
i
indicated
--
mr.
samuel
a.
hirshowitz
no,
sir.
mr.
samuel
a.
hirshowitz
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
samuel
a.
hirshowitz
no,
problem
at
all
because
it
is
the
--
that
is
the
way
this
country
once
said
this
country
could
not
be
run
by
aliens
and
addition
to
what's
the
--
and
mr.
justice
marshall
--
mr.
samuel
a.
hirshowitz
any
person
--
mr.
samuel
a.
hirshowitz
yes.
in
any
case,
you
can
pick
at
random
situations.
but
the
fact
is
that
all
employees
should
be
citizens
and
it
doesn’t
present
any
part
to
them
from
employment.
now,
these
people
here
who
had
been
in
the
new
york
city
at
least
six
to
ten
years
made
no
effort
to
become
citizens
here.
it’s
no
problem
to
them
whether
its
trash
collectors
or
whether
in
this
case
mc
dougall
was
a
senior,
had
a
senior
job
officer
--
in
the
poverty
program.
let
me
also
study
mr.
justice
marshall
that
the
state
of
new
york
in
the
city
of
new
york
is
now
engaged
in
trying
to
reevaluate
the
merit
system
in
order
to
provide
a
better
means
of
testing
the
entrance
of
a
million
in
a
half
puerto
ricans,
about
two
million
black
citizens
in
the
competitive
class
system.
