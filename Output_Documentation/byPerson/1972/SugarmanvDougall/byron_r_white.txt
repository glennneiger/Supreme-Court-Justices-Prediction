well,
i
know
about
that.
i
know
that’s
what
the
state
constitution
and
how
about
the
validity
of
that
provision
under
equal
protection
clause?
justice
byron

how
about
the
aliens
voting?
justice

so,
the
aliens
don’t
have
the
right
to
vote?
justice
byron

and
assume
those
provisions
that
are
for
voting

for
running
for
office
are
valid
under
the
equal

would
that
make
your

let’s
assume
that
that
the

that
of

is
valid

now,

the
board
of

no
one
aliens

now,
is
it
such
a
long
step
to
say
that

work
for
the

to

he
might

run

but
the
state

excludes
aliens,
excludes
your
clients
to
military
service?
disqualify
them
from
serving
in
the
army?
justice

to
say
that
they
are

disqualified

justice

i
agree
with

just
like
across
the

so
your

you
still

yes.
