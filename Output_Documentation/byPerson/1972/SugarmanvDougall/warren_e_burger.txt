chief

warren
e.

thank
you
mr.

mr.

chief

warren
e.

that’s
a
matter
of
a
choice
by
the
state,
is
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it’s
a
matter
of
choice
by
the
state?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
which
are
not
--
we’re
talking
about
the
compulsion
of
the
fourteenth
amendment?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
about
the
federal
statute
which
has
been
reproduced
at
page
40
of
the
--
of
your
friend’s
brief?
what
do
you
have
to
say
about
the
constitutionality
of
that
statute?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
its
1972
which
would
appear
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
think
this
--
the
federal
statute
is
unconstitutional?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
what's
wrong
with
relying
on
the
fourteenth
amendment
to
repeal
the
provision
of
the
president
of
united
states
must
be
a
native
born
american
citizen?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
before
you
start
--
when
you
start
down
that
road,
suppose
a
citizen
of
venezuela
who
came
up
here
and
like
the
country
but
wanted
to
keep
his
citizenship
in
venezuela
filed
for
the
president
of
united
states,
and
the
issue
might
arise
when
he
was
trying
to
run
in
an
state
primary
let
us
say.
now
then
on
your
theory,
the
fourteenth
amendment
could
be
read
as
having
repealed?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
other
words,
he
wants
to
keep
his
options
open?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
on
your
theory,
you’ve
just
told
us
i
thought
that
they
should
be
entitled
to
vote?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
that
they
are
entitled
to
run
for
public
office?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
isn’t
that
keeping
options
open?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
about
an
alien
who
came
here
and
then
returned
to
his
native
land.
would
you
say
he
was
entitled
to
vote
by
on
your
view
by
an
absentee
ballot?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
[voice
overlap]
doesn’t
make
him
a
non-resident
alien
on
your
theory?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
on
your
theory?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
thought
there
is
in
law
but
what's
your
theory
of
the
difference?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
it
would
make
any
difference
what
their
race
was,
if
they
were
coming
from
the
south
to
the
north,
if
they
were
people
here?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
of
course,
that’s
doesn’t
have
anything
to
do
with
this
case,
does
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
where
did
this
court
ever
say
that?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
for
purposes?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
yes.
it
said
these
are
suspect
classes
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
which
means
nothing
more
or
less
has
as
i
think
chief
justice
warren
said
that
we
scrutinized
the
line
drawing
and
the
basis
of
the
classification
very
carefully.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
you
think
mr.
evens
the
--
what
would
you
think
of
the
statute
of
the
state
of
new
york
that
will
have
a
limitation
to
the
employment
of
people
in
these
categories
who
had
signified
their
intention
to
become
citizens
by
having
filed
the
first
application?
do
you
think
that
would
equally
violate
the
fourteenth
amendment?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
yes.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
aren’t
--
we
haven’t
found
that
the
reasons
that
are
argued.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
court
of
appeals,
the
three-judge
court
didn’t
rest
on
any
significance
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
i
recall
that
you
do
make
a
distinction
between
resident
and
non-resident
aliens?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
accept
that?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
other
words
if
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
does
that
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
with
this
--
with
your
constitutional
objections
to
this
statute
disappear
then
if
the
statute
said
that
this
could
be
waived
under
certain
circumstances?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
all
new
yorkers
said
about
this
governor’s
aides
that
hypothetical
people
you're
talking
about?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
are
that
governor
may
appoint
some
of
them
if
he
wants
to?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now,
what
if
in
the
civil
service
they
said
that
the
head
of
the
agency
may
appoint
some
aliens
who
rank
in
the
first
three
of
the
civil
service
if
they
want
to?
wouldn’t
that
be
the
same
situation?
chief

warren
e.

very
well.
