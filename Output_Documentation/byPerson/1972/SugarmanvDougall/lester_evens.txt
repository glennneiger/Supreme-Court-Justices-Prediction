mr.
lester
evens
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
really
frankly
don’t
know
where
to
begin.
i
was
extremely
troubled
by
the
briefs
submitted
by
the
appellants
and
frankly
very
troubled
by
the
argument
today.
there
are
references
that
are
made
apparently
made
by
the
appellees
that
state
that
we
would
not
object
if
certain
jobs
are
eliminated
and
others
were
included.
i
don’t
recall
ever
making
any
such
statement
and
if
i
had
i
certainly
would
take
this
opportunity
to
clarify
the
point
that
we
certainly
consider
this
the
most
ranked
form
of
classification
in
violation
of
equal
protection
clause.
and
that
it
would
--
will
apply
across
the
board
regardless
of
the
positions
involved.
when
i
attempted
to
read
the
brief
of
the
appellants
and
frankly
i
had
a
great
deal
of
difficulty.
mr.
lester
evens
the
remarks
on
--
mr.
lester
evens
yes,
i
do.
i
do
it
quite
clearly.
i
think
that
without
any
characterization
about
judge
lumbard’s
decision.
i
do
think
that
his
opening
paragraph
essentially
recited
or
restated
the
law
as
it
should
be
and
was
in
concurrence
incurrence
with
the
opinion
that
was
written
and
then
seemed
to
have
diluted
or
vitiated
the
impact
of
the
original
decision
without
any
basic
justification.
if
i
may
point
out
as
mr.
hirshowitz
has
indicated.
new
york
state
civil
service
statute
is
broken
down
to
two
major
categories,
the
classified
and
the
unclassified.
included
in
the
unclassified
are
elective
officers
from
the
governor
to
the
legislators.
it
also
includes
a
number
of
other
very
essential
important
positions
such
as
heads
of
departments
and
appointments
made
directly
by
the
governor,
either
with
or
without
the
consent
of
the
state
senate.
any
discussions
about
positions
of
policy
or
having
an
essential
impact
upon
the
running
of
the
government
of
the
state
certainly
would
seem
to
fall
primarily
within
this
class.
and
yet,
this
very
class
makes
no
reference
to
citizenship
whatsoever.
mr.
lester
evens
well,
what
i'm
saying
how
--
it
includes
elective
plus
heads
of
departments
and
appointments
by
the
governor
directly,
executive
appointments
and
it
includes
appointments
by
the
legislature
for
various
jobs.
mr.
lester
evens
must
be
a
citizen.
mr.
lester
evens
no.
he’s
required
to
be
a
citizen
under
the
constitution.
i'm
referring
specifically
to
the
constitution
of
the
state
of
new
york
requires
all
those
in
the
elective
office
to
be
citizens
of
the
united
states.
mr.
lester
evens
in
elective
office.
mr.
lester
evens
at
every
level.
mr.
lester
evens
of
the
united
states.
mr.
lester
evens
and
of
the
state
of
new
york,
residency
of
the
state
of
new
york
in
varying
degrees
depending
upon
the
position
involved.
for
the
governor
the
requirement
is
the
longest.
mr.
lester
evens
none
can
be
a
resident
alien
under
the
constitution
of
the
state
of
new
york,
however,
under
the
unclassified
designation
within
the
civil
service
statute.
there
are
number
of
other
positions
enunciated
in
that
statute
other
than
elective
office.
they
enunciate
heads
of
various
departments.
they
enunciate
appointments
by
the
governor
directly
either
with
or
without
the
consent
of
the
senate
to
positions
that
the
governor
would
appoint
to
in
running
the
executive
branch
of
the
government.
they
refer
to
certain
positions
appointed
by
the
legislature
itself.
now,
it
would
seem
to
me
that
if
issues
of
policy
and
loyalty
and
of
that
nature
would
be
involved,
it
would
clearly
be
the
people
who
would
have
these
very
responsible
positions
both
with
the
executive
branch
of
the
state
and
the
legislative
branch
and
particularly
heads
of
departments.
mr.
lester
evens
i'm
sorry.
mr.
lester
evens
it
would
seem
to
me
quite
clearly
under
the
constitution
of
the
state
of
new
york
that
you
are
required
to
be
a
citizen
to
run
for
office.
mr.
lester
evens
my
personal
attitude
is
that
i
have
difficulty
with
that.
that
i
think
that
the
--
mr.
lester
evens
i
think
that
aliens
certainly
should
have
the
right
to
vote.
certainly
--
mr.
lester
evens
they
don’t
have
the
right
to
vote
in
new
york
state.
mr.
lester
evens
no.
i
really
do
not
think
so
because
i
think
that
again,
to
refer
back
to
the
brief
of
the
appellants
in
this
proceeding.
i
think
there
was
a
confusion
concerning
the
elements
necessary
under
the
equal
protection
clause.
it
is
my
understanding
that
it
is
--
they're
essentially
two
basic
sections
to
the
equal
protection
clause
the
traditional
one
for
which
there
can
be
an
application
of
a
rational
relationship.
the
other
being
any
classification
which
might
be
based
on
race
which
would
be
an
invidious
classification
would
require
very
strict
judicial
review.
mr.
lester
evens
no,
i
find
it
in
the
cases
and
i
refer
specifically
in
most
recent
case
in
graham
versus
richardson.
and
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
i
believe
that
the
equal
protection
argument
was
raised
in
lindsay
versus
normet.
and
in
that
case,
i
believe
mr.
justice
white
had
stated
that
a
reasonable
application
of
a
summary
kind
of
proceeding
in
which
the
parties
were
limited
in
terms
of
the
counter-defenses
they
could
raise
was
very
rational
and
reasonable
because
the
statute
was
intended
to
overcome
consequences
which
were
much
dire.
yet,
nevertheless
there
was
an
issue
of
due
of
process
that
could
have
been
involved
in
that
proceeding
and
sustained
the
statute
in
oregon.
mr.
lester
evens
yes.
mr.
lester
evens
the
initial
position
--
mr.
lester
evens
except
if
i
may
just
point
out,
we
are
here
challenging
section
53
of
the
new
york
state
civil
service
statute.
section
53
is
the
merit
section
of
the
competitive
section
of
the
civil
service
statute.
as
i
try
to
point
out
earlier,
there
are
various
sections
within
the
civil
service
statute
which
involve
in
fact
very
important
policy
positions
in
which
there
are
no
restrictions
concerning
citizenship.
and
in
fact
the
governor
could
appoint
aids
and
people
who
would
assist
them
in
making
very
important
policy
decisions
of
the
state
and
it
would
have
to
be
no
regard.
they
need
not
to
be
in
any
regard
as
to
the
issues
--
mr.
lester
evens
pardon?
mr.
lester
evens
or
by
the
executive
who
has
the
certainly
that
prerogative
to
act
--
mr.
lester
evens
however,
mr.
chief
justice,
i
believe
that
that’s
relevant
to
exactly
the
issue
that’s
involved
here.
the
state
is
endeavoring
by
a
statute
to
legislate
the
elimination
of
an
entire
class
from
public
employment.
with
an
apparatus
where
if
there
was
a
foundation
or
a
basis
for
determining
that
certain
individuals
where
not
competent
to
hold
jobs,
perhaps
an
alien
coming
to
this
country
holding
in
a
publicly
elected
office.
they
certainly,
the
civil
service
commission
is
more
than
competent
to
deal
with
this.
this
would
not
require
the
kind
of
legislative
situation
in
an
elective
office.
mr.
lester
evens
is
that
the
statute
that
was
recently
amended
in
1970
or
1971?
mr.
lester
evens
1972.
i
believe
that
that’s
the
statute
that
may
have
been
involved
ultimately
in
the
matter
of
jalil
versus
hampton
in
which
this
court
denied
a
writ
of
certiorari.
i
think
that
it
would
equally
apply
in
this
--
to
this
statute
as
it
would
in
the
state.
mr.
lester
evens
yes,
your
honor
i
do.
mr.
lester
evens
yes,
your
honor.
i'm
troubled
in
terms
of
the
broad
scope
of
the
exclusion.
to
analogously
recite
the
requirements
of
the
immigration
naturalization
law
which
sets
forth
very
particular
detail
regarding
political
affiliations
and
character
and
so
forth,
i
think
that
that
is
does
not
disturbed
me
as
being
violative
of
the
equal
protection
clause.
but
i
do
think
that
that
with
regard
to
just
generally
and
broadly
saying
that
in
the
entire
class
of
people
should
not
be
permitted
to
hold
office
in
and
out
of
itself,
at
any
particular
context
thus
disturb
me.
mr.
lester
evens
yes.
mr.
lester
evens
congress,
yes.
mr.
lester
evens
yes.
mr.
lester
evens
well,
in
that
situation
i
would
have
to
respond
and
i
don’t
mean
to
be
evasive
that
i
don’t
see
the
mechanism
or
the
device
to
do
anything
concerning
that
other
than
the
method
of
repeal.
i
do
think
that
this
court
could
review
the
constitution
of
the
state
new
york.
i
think
that
perhaps
–
well,
essentially
what
i'm
trying
to
say
mr.
justice
blackmun
is
that
the
traditional
classical
roles
of
citizenship
are
seem
to
be
changing
and
perhaps
changing
for
the
better.
and
i
do
think
that
conceivably
if
such
a
matter
could
be
approved
by
the
citizenry
of
the
united
states,
it
might
want
to
change.
i
don’t
see
the
apparatus
beyond
repeal
that
could
in
anyway
change
the
united
states.
mr.
lester
evens
well,
i
have
--
i
must
start
--
mr.
lester
evens
if
i
may.
it
is
my
position
that
i
am
endeavoring
to
take
in
this
is
that
there
are
other
qualifications
can
be
imposed
that
a
mere
broad
classification
involving
alienage
raises
very,
very
serious
questions.
i
think
that
the
brief
of
the
appellants
in
and
off
itself
their
arguments
seem
to
substantiate
that
this
is
essentially
a
discriminatory
device.
i
would
like
to
--
in
response
to
what
you
are
saying.
i’d
like
to
point
out,
mr.
dougall’s
name
was
mentioned
that
he
had
come
here
in
1964
and
never
made
any
effort
to
become
a
citizen
of
united
states.
mr.
dougall
came
here
from
british
guiana.
he
came
as
an
ex-patriot
as
essentially
a
political
refugee.
as
long
as
the
government
and
british
guiana
never
changes,
mr.
dougall
has
no
intentions
whatsoever
of
returning
to
british
guiana.
however,
mr.
dougall
has
made
it
very
clear
that
if
there
is
a
change
in
government
that
would
make
it
possible
for
him
to
return,
he
would
at
that
time
return.
nevertheless,
he
has
been
and
continues
to
be
a
viable
resident
of
the
state
of
new
york,
has
always
endeavored
to
work,
has
paid
taxes,
has
done
all
of
the
other
things
and
in
fact
has
a
family
and
children.
and
quite
incidentally,
his
children
have
been
born
in
the
united
states
because
he
has
been
married
since
he
was
here.
mr.
lester
evens
no.
no,
your
honor.
he
has
never
said
he
wanted
to
keep
his
options
open.
he
has
clearly
said
i
always
want
to
return
to
british
guiana
but
i
cannot
return
to
the
government
that
there's
now
because
it’s
that
very
government
that
has
been
so
hostile
to
me
that
i
have
been
forced
to
leave.
i
should
point
out
that
two
of
the
other
named
plaintiffs
in
this
proceeding
are
refugees
from
cuba.
they
are
incidentally
very
young
and
they
came
here
at
a
very
young
age
with
their
families.
it
is
impossible
for
them
to
return
to
the
very
same
government
that
exists
in
cuba
that
they
runaway
from.
now,
incidentally
one
of
them
has
applied
for
american
citizenship.
all
three
of
the
named
women
plaintiffs
are
all
around
the
age
of
21
or
slightly
older
and
one
of
them
has
definitely,
one
of
the
cuban
citizens
has
applied
for
citizenship,
the
other
has
not.
but
however,
it
is
impossible
for
them
to
return
at
this
time
whether
or
not
they
would
return
if
the
government
would
change,
i
don’t
know.
i
do
know
in
the
case
of
mr.
dougall
that
he
definitely
would
return.
it
isn’t
a
question
that
these
people
are
endeavoring
to
take
advantage
of
both
sides
of
the
argument
or
to
have
their
cake
and
eat
it.
it’s
a
question
really
they
have
very
few
options
but
certainly
they
should
have
the
right
and
the
prerogative
to
decide
where
they
wish
to
be
a
citizen.
mr.
lester
evens
yes.
mr.
lester
evens
yes.
mr.
lester
evens
it
may
keep
options
open
but
i
certainly
doesn’t
--
don’t
--
do
not
think
that
it
is
necessary
their
intention
to
keep
these
options
open.
the
brief
seems
to
state
that
they
are
going
to
try
and
get
the
best
of
all
possible
worlds
that
aliens
have
some
great
advantage
over
citizens
in
the
united
states.
yet,
the
court
have
repeatedly
said
the
language
in
the
caroline
case
in
which
the
court
has
repeatedly
said
that
they
are
disadvantaged
group
and
require
special
consideration
of
the
judiciary
in
reviewing
classifications
that
are
made
against
them.
mr.
lester
evens
no.
i
would
again
say
that
this
person
--
mr.
lester
evens
i
--
there
is
a
distinction
between
a
resident
and
non-resident
alien.
mr.
lester
evens
yes.
mr.
lester
evens
our
theory
has
been
that
the
resident
aliens
involved
the
name
plaintiffs
and
the
class
they
represent
in
this
proceeding
at
people
who
are
participating
as
viable
members
of
the
state
of
new
york
had
live
their
legally
and
lawfully,
had
designated
new
york
as
their
residence.
and
that
they
should
have
the
right
and
the
entitlement
to
participate
in
all
of
the
activities
of
that
state
including
right
to
have
--
do
not
have
doors
of
employment
close
to
them.
now,
if
mr.
dougall
--
mr.
lester
evens
it
would
be
very
difficult
for
me
to
answer
that
question.
i
can
see
--
mr.
lester
evens
well,
the
benefit
of
the
american
citizenship
for
one
essentially
sets
forth
a
political
benefit.
if
i
may
say
--
mr.
lester
evens
well
--
mr.
lester
evens
what
i'm
saying
is
it
that,
this
is
a
country
that
has
granted
refuge
to
political
refugees
and
the
--
well,
let
me
withdraw
that.
i
would
respond
in
the
sense
by
answering
question.
does
citizenship
require
any
special
benefit?
and
i
have
trouble
with
that.
i
don’t
think
that
citizenship
necessarily
--
mr.
lester
evens
if
people
were
not
discriminated
against
and
if
the
equal
protection
rights
were
not
violated.
mr.
lester
evens
it
was
my
understanding,
yes.
but
in
my
understanding
the
fourteenth
amendment
says
that
we
will
--
mr.
lester
evens
well,
i
do
not
intend
to
go
away
from
the
issue
of
this
case.
it’s
my
intention
to
spell
out
that
on
questions
of
employment
the
state
cannot
justify
in
anyway
any
position
nor
have
they,
that
in
any
way
could
not
be
preformed
by
a
lawful
resident
alien
of
the
state
as
but
then
by
anyone
else.
now,
if
i
am
asked
questions
such
as,
should
aliens
be
allowed
to
be
on
petit
or
grand
juries
which
they
are
not
allowed
to
be
in
the
state
of
new
york,
or
should
they
be
allowed
to
vote,
or
should
they
be
allowed
to
hold
public
office.
these
are
highly
hypothetical
questions
which
are
very
difficult
for
me
to
answer
because
it
means
that
i
must
take
a
position
which
really
quite
remove
from
the
case
before
us.
these
situations
do
exist.
there
are
obviously
differences
where
it
is
applicable.
i
think
however
that
the
cases
have
clearly
indicated
and
it
was
clearly
pointed
out
in
shapiro
v.
thompson
and
in
graham
v.
richardson
that
when
there
is
a
classification
that
discriminates
against
aliens.
its
tantamount
to
discriminating
against
a
class
because
of
race
and
if
we
were
to
make
rules
that
black
people
from
the
south
coming
to
the
new
--
to
new
york
could
or
couldn’t
do
things
simply
because
they
were
black
and
from
the
south.
that
would
be
objectionable
and
i
believe
totally
unconstitutional
if
there
are
any
such
statutes
enacted.
mr.
lester
evens
well,
if
they
came
from
--
if
they
came
from
adjoining
states
of
connecticut
or
new
jersey
or
pennsylvania,
if
they
were
black
and
the
statute
said
that
blacks
could
not
be
a
civil
service
employees
because
they
are
unstable
and
because
they
are
disloyal
or
they
have
loyalty
to
the
state
that
they
came
from.
this
would
be
unquestionably
--
mr.
lester
evens
it
does
in
the
sense
that
the
classifications’
concerning
aliens
is
tantamount
to
a
classification
concerning
race.
mr.
lester
evens
it
is
my
understanding
that’s
exactly
what
the
court
said
in
graham
v.
richardson
--
mr.
lester
evens
for
purposes
of
the
degree
of
judicial
scrutiny
on
the
equal
protection
clause.
mr.
lester
evens
yes.
mr.
lester
evens
yes.
mr.
lester
evens
more
strictly
than
would
be
if
it
were
a
matter
not
a
grace.
mr.
lester
evens
yes,
they
certainly
do.
all
of
my
clients
and
now
over
the
age
of
21
and
could
qualify
to
become
citizens.
there
are
questions
of
whether
or
not
they
choose
to
take
that
option.
and
as
i
pointed
out,
some
of
them
really
are
here
as
political
refugees
and
really
fully
intend
to
return.
it
should
be
pointed
out
too
incidentally
but
these
people
were
employed
by
the
city
of
new
york
and
were
fired.
these
people
were
not
seeking
positions
and
when
they
were
employed
by
the
city
of
new
york,
they
were
informed
that
they
would
maintain
the
status
that
they
always
had
before.
they
work
for
a
non-profit
corporation
which
happens
to
be
funded
by
the
office
of
economic
opportunity
and
the
office
of
economic
opportunity
cutoff
the
funding
for
the
particular
positions
that
they
were
working
in.
and
the
city
of
new
york
said,
“we
will
incorporate
this
now
into
one
of
the
departments
within
the
city
of
new
york
and
you
will
be
permitted
to
continue
to
work
and
you
will
be
permitted
to
continue
to
maintain
the
same
position
that
you
have
at
the
very
same
salary.”
and
very
shortly
thereafter,
they
were
informed
by
letter
that
the
only
reason
they
were
being
fired
was
because
of
there
citizenship
not
because
of
any
questions
of
competence
or
character
or
anything
else.
now,
it
was
pointed
out
by
my
adversary
during
argument
that
the
prevailing
law
today
concerning
public
employment
is
crane
and
hines,
and
cited
mr.
justice
blackmun’s
decision
in
graham
v.
richardson
as
sustaining
this
position.
it
was
my
understanding
in
reading
that
decision
that
what
the
court
said
is
we
are
not
dealing
with
the
issue
of
employment
and
public
employment
at
this
time.
we
are
dealing
with
an
issue
of
welfare
benefits.
as
judge
tenney
in
the
district
court
in
writing
the
opinion
in
this
case
below
stated,
“the
time
has
arrived.
the
dougall
case
has
now
presented
that
time
with
the
issue
of
employment
has
now
come
up
concerning
aliens
and
that
at
this
very
appropriate
to
review
that.”
and
in
light
of
the
decision
on
graham
v.
richardson,
this
is
a
classification
that
ever
requires
the
strict
judicial
scrutiny
and
the
appellants
in
this
proceeding
have
not
sustained
or
met
that
requirement.
mr.
lester
evens
if
that
requirement
were
in
there?
mr.
lester
evens
i
incidentally
there
is
a
statute
that
does.
i
believe
the
second
half
of
section
53
that
we
have
before
has
some
such
reference
to
it
at
filing
a
declaration
of
intention
to
become
a
citizen.
i
personally,
i
have
trouble
with
it
if
the
reason
the
state
of
new
york
has
set
forth
this
classification.
it
was
for
unconstitutional
reason
and
i
believe
it
was
for
a
non-constitutional
reason.
it
was
discriminating
against
the
class.
and
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
in
the
brief
of
the
appellants
in
this
proceeding,
they
indicate
that
aliens
are
unstable,
there
is
no
evidence
of
their
instability.
they
indicate
that
even
if
an
alien
took
an
oath
as
might
be
required
of
civil
service
employees,
we
wouldn’t
necessarily
believe
them
anyway.
mr.
lester
evens
no,
i
understand
that.
mr.
lester
evens
no,
it
didn’t
but
the
reason
that
i
point
this
out
is
it
that
even
using
a
close
judicial
examination
of
what
the
legisla
--
what
was
the
purpose
of
the
legislation
really
does
not
permit
the
statute
to
survive
the
requirements
of
the
equal
protection
clause
and
that
the
examples
for
the
arguments
made
by
the
appellants
are
themselves
invidious.
the
implication
--
mr.
lester
evens
however,
i'm
not
so
sure
that
if
citizen
might
not
subject
to
it.
i
think
that
today
--
mr.
lester
evens
no,
but
a
citizen
might
go
back
to
new
jersey
or
to
washington
district
court.
there
is
certain
no
requirement
to
be
a
resident
of
the
state
of
new
york.
mr.
lester
evens
no.
no,
but
they
certainly
have
come
to
new
york
to
get
employment.
it’s
probably
the
focal
point
of
the
employment
for
the
northeast
area
or
perhaps
even
for
the
country,
and
that
in
fact
we
live
in
a
society
where
our
population
is
very
mobile.
and
to
make
any
kind
of
arguments
to
say
that
aliens
are
more
unstable
than
the
rest
of
population
without
any
foundation
or
basis
for
it
is
auspicious
argument.
if
a
young
person
graduates
from
school
as
it’s
so
typical
and
comes
to
washington
dc
or
comes
to
the
city
of
new
york
to
seek
employment
and
perhaps
to
develop
something
in
a
career
and
never
fully
to
intending
to
stay
permanently,
should
that
person
be
denied
the
right
to
civil
service
employment?
presuming
that
is
a
person
born
and
living
outside
the
state
of
new
york
who
is
a
citizen
of
the
united
states
and
the
statute
does
not
discriminate
against
that
person
nor
do
i
think
it
should.
and
i
cannot
see
any
distinctions
between
non-residents
of
the
state
new
york,
in
terms
of
the
arguments
of
the
appellants
make
and
aliens
who
are
lawful
residents.
the
very
people
that
we
are
talking
about
is
the
name
plaintiffs
in
this
proceeding
admittedly
have
been
living
here
for
a
substantial
period
of
time,
doing
all
of
those
things,
all
them
have
worked.
they
haven’t
been
themselves
indigent
or
force
to
seek
other
forms
of
sustaining
themselves.
they
have
been
working
people.
mr.
lester
evens
yes.
yes,
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
judge
tenney
i
believe
does
as
well
when
he
wrote
the
opinion
of
the
court
below.
mr.
lester
evens
yes.
because
i
do
believe
that
we
have
many,
many
categories
of
aliens.
mr.
lester
evens
people
come
here
on
short
term
visas
as
tourists
and
i
certainly
don’t
think
that
they
would
be
certainly
be
entitled
to
the
kinds
of
prerogatives
that
a
citizen
or
a
resident
alien
would
be
entitled
to.
the
requirements
empowers
by
the
immigration
and
naturalization
act,
a
much
more
stringent
than
they
are
for
someone
who
comes
here
to
take
advantage
of
our
the
marvelous,
its
natural
resources,
visiting
the
parks,
etcetera
and
lives
in
a
short
time.
mr.
lester
evens
under
the
present
law
or
could
they
enact
the
law
saying
aliens
--
mr.
lester
evens
well,
it
sounds
very
similar
to
a
civil
service
statute.
if
--
you
know
my
approach
to
military
service
have
always
been
in
fact
that
aliens
have
been
required
to
serve.
mr.
lester
evens
and
now
using
it
from
the
other
point
of
view,
i
would
have
to
presume
that
to
be
a
form
of
government
employment
or
public
employment,
and
therefore
i
think
that
it
would
equally
objectionable.
mr.
lester
evens
provided,
provided
as
long
as
the
statutes
of
the
state
of
new
york
say
that
the
person
closest
to
the
governor.
the
closest
adviser
to
the
governor
need
not
be
a
citizen,
then
certainly
nobody
else
should
have
to
be
required
to
be
a
citizen
and
the
statute
in
effect
says
that.
mr.
lester
evens
yes.
mr.
lester
evens
i
would.
mr.
lester
evens
no,
i
am
just
trying
to
point
out
the
anomalies
in
the
argument
of
the
appellants.
mr.
lester
evens
how
can
they
argue
--
how
can
they
argue
the
necessity
for
making
policy
decisions
by
someone
who
on
the
one
hand
to
use
the
analogy
the
court
has
used
today
of
a
garbage
collector
or
the
analogy
on
the
other
hand
a
biologist
to
who
happens
to
be
working
with
fungus
on
let’s
say
tobacco
leaves
or
whatever.
mr.
lester
evens
who
is
not
a
citizen?
mr.
lester
evens
can
you
appoint
him
to
high
government
office,
if
he
was
not
a
voter?
mr.
lester
evens
do
you
mean
an
office
such
as
to
fill
a
vacancy
on
the
bench
or
to
fill
a
--
mr.
lester
evens
he
could
not
to
fill
a
vacancy
on
the
bench
or
could
not
to
fill
a
vacancy
in
the
legislature.
mr.
lester
evens
yes.
mr.
lester
evens
i
know
no
governor
who
would
do
that
for
a
many
other
reasons.
i
saying
the
statutes
allow
him
too,
that
is
all
i'm
saying.
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
lester
evens
the
--
my
objection
is
to
the
classification
and
it
would
exists
regardless
to
what
modifications
there
might
be
by
legislation.
i
think
that
this
is
an
attempt
and
an
endeavor
to
take
a
large
segment
of
the
population
of
the
state
of
new
york
and
to
say
to
those
people
you
cannot
work
in
certain
jobs.
mr.
lester
evens
yes.
mr.
lester
evens
yes.
mr.
lester
evens
i
have
some
difficulty
with
that
because
i
think
that
once
we
get
into
qualifications
and
making
divisions
then
we
are
no
longer
performing
a
judicial
function.
we
apparently
are
performing
an
administrative
or
executive
function
or
legislative
function
which
can
very
well
be
handled
by
a
very,
very
sophisticated
and
substantial
body
the
commissioner
and
his
department
of
civil
service
and
that
certainly
he
could
set
forth
reasonable
criteria
of
any
kind.
if
i
may
point
out
mr.
chief
justice,
this
statute
was
originally
amended
to
exclude
non-citizens
in
1939.
the
statute
had
been
on
the
books
for
many
years
before
that
without
any
reference
to
it.
however,
the
commissioner
on
his
own
had
been
discriminating
against
aliens
and
in
fact
it
was
recommended
that
this
particular
law
be
pass
the
amendments
requiring
citizen
to
be
in
a
competitive
civil
service
class
because
the
commissioner
have
been
doing
something
all
along
which
the
legislature
had
not
mandated.
now,
this
was
one
of
the
letters
that
we
had
found
in
the
bill
jacket.
now,
it
seems
to
me
that
if
we
have
before
us
today
the
1939
law
before
it
was
amended
and
the
commissioner
himself
was
discriminating
broadly
against
an
entire
class.
we
would
be
making
the
very
same
argument
whether
it
was
enacted
or
not.
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
lester
evens
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
really
frankly
don’t
know
where
to
begin.
i
was
extremely
troubled
by
the
briefs
submitted
by
the
appellants
and
frankly
very
troubled
by
the
argument
today.
there
are
references
that
are
made
apparently
made
by
the
appellees
that
state
that
we
would
not
object
if
certain
jobs
are
eliminated
and
others
were
included.
i
don’t
recall
ever
making
any
such
statement
and
if
i
had
i
certainly
would
take
this
opportunity
to
clarify
the
point
that
we
certainly
consider
this
the
most
ranked
form
of
classification
in
violation
of
equal
protection
clause.
and
that
it
would
--
will
apply
across
the
board
regardless
of
the
positions
involved.
when
i
attempted
to
read
the
brief
of
the
appellants
and
frankly
i
had
a
great
deal
of
difficulty.
mr.
lester
evens
the
remarks
on
--
mr.
lester
evens
yes,
i
do.
i
do
it
quite
clearly.
i
think
that
without
any
characterization
about
judge
lumbard’s
decision.
i
do
think
that
his
opening
paragraph
essentially
recited
or
restated
the
law
as
it
should
be
and
was
in
concurrence
incurrence
with
the
opinion
that
was
written
and
then
seemed
to
have
diluted
or
vitiated
the
impact
of
the
original
decision
without
any
basic
justification.
if
i
may
point
out
as
mr.
hirshowitz
has
indicated.
new
york
state
civil
service
statute
is
broken
down
to
two
major
categories,
the
classified
and
the
unclassified.
included
in
the
unclassified
are
elective
officers
from
the
governor
to
the
legislators.
it
also
includes
a
number
of
other
very
essential
important
positions
such
as
heads
of
departments
and
appointments
made
directly
by
the
governor,
either
with
or
without
the
consent
of
the
state
senate.
any
discussions
about
positions
of
policy
or
having
an
essential
impact
upon
the
running
of
the
government
of
the
state
certainly
would
seem
to
fall
primarily
within
this
class.
and
yet,
this
very
class
makes
no
reference
to
citizenship
whatsoever.
mr.
lester
evens
well,
what
i'm
saying
how
--
it
includes
elective
plus
heads
of
departments
and
appointments
by
the
governor
directly,
executive
appointments
and
it
includes
appointments
by
the
legislature
for
various
jobs.
mr.
lester
evens
must
be
a
citizen.
mr.
lester
evens
no.
he’s
required
to
be
a
citizen
under
the
constitution.
i'm
referring
specifically
to
the
constitution
of
the
state
of
new
york
requires
all
those
in
the
elective
office
to
be
citizens
of
the
united
states.
mr.
lester
evens
in
elective
office.
mr.
lester
evens
at
every
level.
mr.
lester
evens
of
the
united
states.
mr.
lester
evens
and
of
the
state
of
new
york,
residency
of
the
state
of
new
york
in
varying
degrees
depending
upon
the
position
involved.
for
the
governor
the
requirement
is
the
longest.
mr.
lester
evens
none
can
be
a
resident
alien
under
the
constitution
of
the
state
of
new
york,
however,
under
the
unclassified
designation
within
the
civil
service
statute.
there
are
number
of
other
positions
enunciated
in
that
statute
other
than
elective
office.
they
enunciate
heads
of
various
departments.
they
enunciate
appointments
by
the
governor
directly
either
with
or
without
the
consent
of
the
senate
to
positions
that
the
governor
would
appoint
to
in
running
the
executive
branch
of
the
government.
they
refer
to
certain
positions
appointed
by
the
legislature
itself.
now,
it
would
seem
to
me
that
if
issues
of
policy
and
loyalty
and
of
that
nature
would
be
involved,
it
would
clearly
be
the
people
who
would
have
these
very
responsible
positions
both
with
the
executive
branch
of
the
state
and
the
legislative
branch
and
particularly
heads
of
departments.
mr.
lester
evens
i'm
sorry.
mr.
lester
evens
it
would
seem
to
me
quite
clearly
under
the
constitution
of
the
state
of
new
york
that
you
are
required
to
be
a
citizen
to
run
for
office.
mr.
lester
evens
my
personal
attitude
is
that
i
have
difficulty
with
that.
that
i
think
that
the
--
mr.
lester
evens
i
think
that
aliens
certainly
should
have
the
right
to
vote.
certainly
--
mr.
lester
evens
they
don’t
have
the
right
to
vote
in
new
york
state.
mr.
lester
evens
no.
i
really
do
not
think
so
because
i
think
that
again,
to
refer
back
to
the
brief
of
the
appellants
in
this
proceeding.
i
think
there
was
a
confusion
concerning
the
elements
necessary
under
the
equal
protection
clause.
it
is
my
understanding
that
it
is
--
they're
essentially
two
basic
sections
to
the
equal
protection
clause
the
traditional
one
for
which
there
can
be
an
application
of
a
rational
relationship.
the
other
being
any
classification
which
might
be
based
on
race
which
would
be
an
invidious
classification
would
require
very
strict
judicial
review.
mr.
lester
evens
no,
i
find
it
in
the
cases
and
i
refer
specifically
in
most
recent
case
in
graham
versus
richardson.
and
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
i
believe
that
the
equal
protection
argument
was
raised
in
lindsay
versus
normet.
and
in
that
case,
i
believe
mr.
justice
white
had
stated
that
a
reasonable
application
of
a
summary
kind
of
proceeding
in
which
the
parties
were
limited
in
terms
of
the
counter-defenses
they
could
raise
was
very
rational
and
reasonable
because
the
statute
was
intended
to
overcome
consequences
which
were
much
dire.
yet,
nevertheless
there
was
an
issue
of
due
of
process
that
could
have
been
involved
in
that
proceeding
and
sustained
the
statute
in
oregon.
mr.
lester
evens
yes.
mr.
lester
evens
the
initial
position
--
mr.
lester
evens
except
if
i
may
just
point
out,
we
are
here
challenging
section
53
of
the
new
york
state
civil
service
statute.
section
53
is
the
merit
section
of
the
competitive
section
of
the
civil
service
statute.
as
i
try
to
point
out
earlier,
there
are
various
sections
within
the
civil
service
statute
which
involve
in
fact
very
important
policy
positions
in
which
there
are
no
restrictions
concerning
citizenship.
and
in
fact
the
governor
could
appoint
aids
and
people
who
would
assist
them
in
making
very
important
policy
decisions
of
the
state
and
it
would
have
to
be
no
regard.
they
need
not
to
be
in
any
regard
as
to
the
issues
--
mr.
lester
evens
pardon?
mr.
lester
evens
or
by
the
executive
who
has
the
certainly
that
prerogative
to
act
--
mr.
lester
evens
however,
mr.
chief
justice,
i
believe
that
that’s
relevant
to
exactly
the
issue
that’s
involved
here.
the
state
is
endeavoring
by
a
statute
to
legislate
the
elimination
of
an
entire
class
from
public
employment.
with
an
apparatus
where
if
there
was
a
foundation
or
a
basis
for
determining
that
certain
individuals
where
not
competent
to
hold
jobs,
perhaps
an
alien
coming
to
this
country
holding
in
a
publicly
elected
office.
they
certainly,
the
civil
service
commission
is
more
than
competent
to
deal
with
this.
this
would
not
require
the
kind
of
legislative
situation
in
an
elective
office.
mr.
lester
evens
is
that
the
statute
that
was
recently
amended
in
1970
or
1971?
mr.
lester
evens
1972.
i
believe
that
that’s
the
statute
that
may
have
been
involved
ultimately
in
the
matter
of
jalil
versus
hampton
in
which
this
court
denied
a
writ
of
certiorari.
i
think
that
it
would
equally
apply
in
this
--
to
this
statute
as
it
would
in
the
state.
mr.
lester
evens
yes,
your
honor
i
do.
mr.
lester
evens
yes,
your
honor.
i'm
troubled
in
terms
of
the
broad
scope
of
the
exclusion.
to
analogously
recite
the
requirements
of
the
immigration
naturalization
law
which
sets
forth
very
particular
detail
regarding
political
affiliations
and
character
and
so
forth,
i
think
that
that
is
does
not
disturbed
me
as
being
violative
of
the
equal
protection
clause.
but
i
do
think
that
that
with
regard
to
just
generally
and
broadly
saying
that
in
the
entire
class
of
people
should
not
be
permitted
to
hold
office
in
and
out
of
itself,
at
any
particular
context
thus
disturb
me.
mr.
lester
evens
yes.
mr.
lester
evens
congress,
yes.
mr.
lester
evens
yes.
mr.
lester
evens
well,
in
that
situation
i
would
have
to
respond
and
i
don’t
mean
to
be
evasive
that
i
don’t
see
the
mechanism
or
the
device
to
do
anything
concerning
that
other
than
the
method
of
repeal.
i
do
think
that
this
court
could
review
the
constitution
of
the
state
new
york.
i
think
that
perhaps
–
well,
essentially
what
i'm
trying
to
say
mr.
justice
blackmun
is
that
the
traditional
classical
roles
of
citizenship
are
seem
to
be
changing
and
perhaps
changing
for
the
better.
and
i
do
think
that
conceivably
if
such
a
matter
could
be
approved
by
the
citizenry
of
the
united
states,
it
might
want
to
change.
i
don’t
see
the
apparatus
beyond
repeal
that
could
in
anyway
change
the
united
states.
mr.
lester
evens
well,
i
have
--
i
must
start
--
mr.
lester
evens
if
i
may.
it
is
my
position
that
i
am
endeavoring
to
take
in
this
is
that
there
are
other
qualifications
can
be
imposed
that
a
mere
broad
classification
involving
alienage
raises
very,
very
serious
questions.
i
think
that
the
brief
of
the
appellants
in
and
off
itself
their
arguments
seem
to
substantiate
that
this
is
essentially
a
discriminatory
device.
i
would
like
to
--
in
response
to
what
you
are
saying.
i’d
like
to
point
out,
mr.
dougall’s
name
was
mentioned
that
he
had
come
here
in
1964
and
never
made
any
effort
to
become
a
citizen
of
united
states.
mr.
dougall
came
here
from
british
guiana.
he
came
as
an
ex-patriot
as
essentially
a
political
refugee.
as
long
as
the
government
and
british
guiana
never
changes,
mr.
dougall
has
no
intentions
whatsoever
of
returning
to
british
guiana.
however,
mr.
dougall
has
made
it
very
clear
that
if
there
is
a
change
in
government
that
would
make
it
possible
for
him
to
return,
he
would
at
that
time
return.
nevertheless,
he
has
been
and
continues
to
be
a
viable
resident
of
the
state
of
new
york,
has
always
endeavored
to
work,
has
paid
taxes,
has
done
all
of
the
other
things
and
in
fact
has
a
family
and
children.
and
quite
incidentally,
his
children
have
been
born
in
the
united
states
because
he
has
been
married
since
he
was
here.
mr.
lester
evens
no.
no,
your
honor.
he
has
never
said
he
wanted
to
keep
his
options
open.
he
has
clearly
said
i
always
want
to
return
to
british
guiana
but
i
cannot
return
to
the
government
that
there's
now
because
it’s
that
very
government
that
has
been
so
hostile
to
me
that
i
have
been
forced
to
leave.
i
should
point
out
that
two
of
the
other
named
plaintiffs
in
this
proceeding
are
refugees
from
cuba.
they
are
incidentally
very
young
and
they
came
here
at
a
very
young
age
with
their
families.
it
is
impossible
for
them
to
return
to
the
very
same
government
that
exists
in
cuba
that
they
runaway
from.
now,
incidentally
one
of
them
has
applied
for
american
citizenship.
all
three
of
the
named
women
plaintiffs
are
all
around
the
age
of
21
or
slightly
older
and
one
of
them
has
definitely,
one
of
the
cuban
citizens
has
applied
for
citizenship,
the
other
has
not.
but
however,
it
is
impossible
for
them
to
return
at
this
time
whether
or
not
they
would
return
if
the
government
would
change,
i
don’t
know.
i
do
know
in
the
case
of
mr.
dougall
that
he
definitely
would
return.
it
isn’t
a
question
that
these
people
are
endeavoring
to
take
advantage
of
both
sides
of
the
argument
or
to
have
their
cake
and
eat
it.
it’s
a
question
really
they
have
very
few
options
but
certainly
they
should
have
the
right
and
the
prerogative
to
decide
where
they
wish
to
be
a
citizen.
mr.
lester
evens
yes.
mr.
lester
evens
yes.
mr.
lester
evens
it
may
keep
options
open
but
i
certainly
doesn’t
--
don’t
--
do
not
think
that
it
is
necessary
their
intention
to
keep
these
options
open.
the
brief
seems
to
state
that
they
are
going
to
try
and
get
the
best
of
all
possible
worlds
that
aliens
have
some
great
advantage
over
citizens
in
the
united
states.
yet,
the
court
have
repeatedly
said
the
language
in
the
caroline
case
in
which
the
court
has
repeatedly
said
that
they
are
disadvantaged
group
and
require
special
consideration
of
the
judiciary
in
reviewing
classifications
that
are
made
against
them.
mr.
lester
evens
no.
i
would
again
say
that
this
person
--
mr.
lester
evens
i
--
there
is
a
distinction
between
a
resident
and
non-resident
alien.
mr.
lester
evens
yes.
mr.
lester
evens
our
theory
has
been
that
the
resident
aliens
involved
the
name
plaintiffs
and
the
class
they
represent
in
this
proceeding
at
people
who
are
participating
as
viable
members
of
the
state
of
new
york
had
live
their
legally
and
lawfully,
had
designated
new
york
as
their
residence.
and
that
they
should
have
the
right
and
the
entitlement
to
participate
in
all
of
the
activities
of
that
state
including
right
to
have
--
do
not
have
doors
of
employment
close
to
them.
now,
if
mr.
dougall
--
mr.
lester
evens
it
would
be
very
difficult
for
me
to
answer
that
question.
i
can
see
--
mr.
lester
evens
well,
the
benefit
of
the
american
citizenship
for
one
essentially
sets
forth
a
political
benefit.
if
i
may
say
--
mr.
lester
evens
well
--
mr.
lester
evens
what
i'm
saying
is
it
that,
this
is
a
country
that
has
granted
refuge
to
political
refugees
and
the
--
well,
let
me
withdraw
that.
i
would
respond
in
the
sense
by
answering
question.
does
citizenship
require
any
special
benefit?
and
i
have
trouble
with
that.
i
don’t
think
that
citizenship
necessarily
--
mr.
lester
evens
if
people
were
not
discriminated
against
and
if
the
equal
protection
rights
were
not
violated.
mr.
lester
evens
it
was
my
understanding,
yes.
but
in
my
understanding
the
fourteenth
amendment
says
that
we
will
--
mr.
lester
evens
well,
i
do
not
intend
to
go
away
from
the
issue
of
this
case.
it’s
my
intention
to
spell
out
that
on
questions
of
employment
the
state
cannot
justify
in
anyway
any
position
nor
have
they,
that
in
any
way
could
not
be
preformed
by
a
lawful
resident
alien
of
the
state
as
but
then
by
anyone
else.
now,
if
i
am
asked
questions
such
as,
should
aliens
be
allowed
to
be
on
petit
or
grand
juries
which
they
are
not
allowed
to
be
in
the
state
of
new
york,
or
should
they
be
allowed
to
vote,
or
should
they
be
allowed
to
hold
public
office.
these
are
highly
hypothetical
questions
which
are
very
difficult
for
me
to
answer
because
it
means
that
i
must
take
a
position
which
really
quite
remove
from
the
case
before
us.
these
situations
do
exist.
there
are
obviously
differences
where
it
is
applicable.
i
think
however
that
the
cases
have
clearly
indicated
and
it
was
clearly
pointed
out
in
shapiro
v.
thompson
and
in
graham
v.
richardson
that
when
there
is
a
classification
that
discriminates
against
aliens.
its
tantamount
to
discriminating
against
a
class
because
of
race
and
if
we
were
to
make
rules
that
black
people
from
the
south
coming
to
the
new
--
to
new
york
could
or
couldn’t
do
things
simply
because
they
were
black
and
from
the
south.
that
would
be
objectionable
and
i
believe
totally
unconstitutional
if
there
are
any
such
statutes
enacted.
mr.
lester
evens
well,
if
they
came
from
--
if
they
came
from
adjoining
states
of
connecticut
or
new
jersey
or
pennsylvania,
if
they
were
black
and
the
statute
said
that
blacks
could
not
be
a
civil
service
employees
because
they
are
unstable
and
because
they
are
disloyal
or
they
have
loyalty
to
the
state
that
they
came
from.
this
would
be
unquestionably
--
mr.
lester
evens
it
does
in
the
sense
that
the
classifications’
concerning
aliens
is
tantamount
to
a
classification
concerning
race.
mr.
lester
evens
it
is
my
understanding
that’s
exactly
what
the
court
said
in
graham
v.
richardson
--
mr.
lester
evens
for
purposes
of
the
degree
of
judicial
scrutiny
on
the
equal
protection
clause.
mr.
lester
evens
yes.
mr.
lester
evens
yes.
mr.
lester
evens
more
strictly
than
would
be
if
it
were
a
matter
not
a
grace.
mr.
lester
evens
yes,
they
certainly
do.
all
of
my
clients
and
now
over
the
age
of
21
and
could
qualify
to
become
citizens.
there
are
questions
of
whether
or
not
they
choose
to
take
that
option.
and
as
i
pointed
out,
some
of
them
really
are
here
as
political
refugees
and
really
fully
intend
to
return.
it
should
be
pointed
out
too
incidentally
but
these
people
were
employed
by
the
city
of
new
york
and
were
fired.
these
people
were
not
seeking
positions
and
when
they
were
employed
by
the
city
of
new
york,
they
were
informed
that
they
would
maintain
the
status
that
they
always
had
before.
they
work
for
a
non-profit
corporation
which
happens
to
be
funded
by
the
office
of
economic
opportunity
and
the
office
of
economic
opportunity
cutoff
the
funding
for
the
particular
positions
that
they
were
working
in.
and
the
city
of
new
york
said,
“we
will
incorporate
this
now
into
one
of
the
departments
within
the
city
of
new
york
and
you
will
be
permitted
to
continue
to
work
and
you
will
be
permitted
to
continue
to
maintain
the
same
position
that
you
have
at
the
very
same
salary.”
and
very
shortly
thereafter,
they
were
informed
by
letter
that
the
only
reason
they
were
being
fired
was
because
of
there
citizenship
not
because
of
any
questions
of
competence
or
character
or
anything
else.
now,
it
was
pointed
out
by
my
adversary
during
argument
that
the
prevailing
law
today
concerning
public
employment
is
crane
and
hines,
and
cited
mr.
justice
blackmun’s
decision
in
graham
v.
richardson
as
sustaining
this
position.
it
was
my
understanding
in
reading
that
decision
that
what
the
court
said
is
we
are
not
dealing
with
the
issue
of
employment
and
public
employment
at
this
time.
we
are
dealing
with
an
issue
of
welfare
benefits.
as
judge
tenney
in
the
district
court
in
writing
the
opinion
in
this
case
below
stated,
“the
time
has
arrived.
the
dougall
case
has
now
presented
that
time
with
the
issue
of
employment
has
now
come
up
concerning
aliens
and
that
at
this
very
appropriate
to
review
that.”
and
in
light
of
the
decision
on
graham
v.
richardson,
this
is
a
classification
that
ever
requires
the
strict
judicial
scrutiny
and
the
appellants
in
this
proceeding
have
not
sustained
or
met
that
requirement.
mr.
lester
evens
if
that
requirement
were
in
there?
mr.
lester
evens
i
incidentally
there
is
a
statute
that
does.
i
believe
the
second
half
of
section
53
that
we
have
before
has
some
such
reference
to
it
at
filing
a
declaration
of
intention
to
become
a
citizen.
i
personally,
i
have
trouble
with
it
if
the
reason
the
state
of
new
york
has
set
forth
this
classification.
it
was
for
unconstitutional
reason
and
i
believe
it
was
for
a
non-constitutional
reason.
it
was
discriminating
against
the
class.
and
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
in
the
brief
of
the
appellants
in
this
proceeding,
they
indicate
that
aliens
are
unstable,
there
is
no
evidence
of
their
instability.
they
indicate
that
even
if
an
alien
took
an
oath
as
might
be
required
of
civil
service
employees,
we
wouldn’t
necessarily
believe
them
anyway.
mr.
lester
evens
no,
i
understand
that.
mr.
lester
evens
no,
it
didn’t
but
the
reason
that
i
point
this
out
is
it
that
even
using
a
close
judicial
examination
of
what
the
legisla
--
what
was
the
purpose
of
the
legislation
really
does
not
permit
the
statute
to
survive
the
requirements
of
the
equal
protection
clause
and
that
the
examples
for
the
arguments
made
by
the
appellants
are
themselves
invidious.
the
implication
--
mr.
lester
evens
however,
i'm
not
so
sure
that
if
citizen
might
not
subject
to
it.
i
think
that
today
--
mr.
lester
evens
no,
but
a
citizen
might
go
back
to
new
jersey
or
to
washington
district
court.
there
is
certain
no
requirement
to
be
a
resident
of
the
state
of
new
york.
mr.
lester
evens
no.
no,
but
they
certainly
have
come
to
new
york
to
get
employment.
it’s
probably
the
focal
point
of
the
employment
for
the
northeast
area
or
perhaps
even
for
the
country,
and
that
in
fact
we
live
in
a
society
where
our
population
is
very
mobile.
and
to
make
any
kind
of
arguments
to
say
that
aliens
are
more
unstable
than
the
rest
of
population
without
any
foundation
or
basis
for
it
is
auspicious
argument.
if
a
young
person
graduates
from
school
as
it’s
so
typical
and
comes
to
washington
dc
or
comes
to
the
city
of
new
york
to
seek
employment
and
perhaps
to
develop
something
in
a
career
and
never
fully
to
intending
to
stay
permanently,
should
that
person
be
denied
the
right
to
civil
service
employment?
presuming
that
is
a
person
born
and
living
outside
the
state
of
new
york
who
is
a
citizen
of
the
united
states
and
the
statute
does
not
discriminate
against
that
person
nor
do
i
think
it
should.
and
i
cannot
see
any
distinctions
between
non-residents
of
the
state
new
york,
in
terms
of
the
arguments
of
the
appellants
make
and
aliens
who
are
lawful
residents.
the
very
people
that
we
are
talking
about
is
the
name
plaintiffs
in
this
proceeding
admittedly
have
been
living
here
for
a
substantial
period
of
time,
doing
all
of
those
things,
all
them
have
worked.
they
haven’t
been
themselves
indigent
or
force
to
seek
other
forms
of
sustaining
themselves.
they
have
been
working
people.
mr.
lester
evens
yes.
yes,
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
judge
tenney
i
believe
does
as
well
when
he
wrote
the
opinion
of
the
court
below.
mr.
lester
evens
yes.
because
i
do
believe
that
we
have
many,
many
categories
of
aliens.
mr.
lester
evens
people
come
here
on
short
term
visas
as
tourists
and
i
certainly
don’t
think
that
they
would
be
certainly
be
entitled
to
the
kinds
of
prerogatives
that
a
citizen
or
a
resident
alien
would
be
entitled
to.
the
requirements
empowers
by
the
immigration
and
naturalization
act,
a
much
more
stringent
than
they
are
for
someone
who
comes
here
to
take
advantage
of
our
the
marvelous,
its
natural
resources,
visiting
the
parks,
etcetera
and
lives
in
a
short
time.
mr.
lester
evens
under
the
present
law
or
could
they
enact
the
law
saying
aliens
--
mr.
lester
evens
well,
it
sounds
very
similar
to
a
civil
service
statute.
if
--
you
know
my
approach
to
military
service
have
always
been
in
fact
that
aliens
have
been
required
to
serve.
mr.
lester
evens
and
now
using
it
from
the
other
point
of
view,
i
would
have
to
presume
that
to
be
a
form
of
government
employment
or
public
employment,
and
therefore
i
think
that
it
would
equally
objectionable.
mr.
lester
evens
provided,
provided
as
long
as
the
statutes
of
the
state
of
new
york
say
that
the
person
closest
to
the
governor.
the
closest
adviser
to
the
governor
need
not
be
a
citizen,
then
certainly
nobody
else
should
have
to
be
required
to
be
a
citizen
and
the
statute
in
effect
says
that.
mr.
lester
evens
yes.
mr.
lester
evens
i
would.
mr.
lester
evens
no,
i
am
just
trying
to
point
out
the
anomalies
in
the
argument
of
the
appellants.
mr.
lester
evens
how
can
they
argue
--
how
can
they
argue
the
necessity
for
making
policy
decisions
by
someone
who
on
the
one
hand
to
use
the
analogy
the
court
has
used
today
of
a
garbage
collector
or
the
analogy
on
the
other
hand
a
biologist
to
who
happens
to
be
working
with
fungus
on
let’s
say
tobacco
leaves
or
whatever.
mr.
lester
evens
who
is
not
a
citizen?
mr.
lester
evens
can
you
appoint
him
to
high
government
office,
if
he
was
not
a
voter?
mr.
lester
evens
do
you
mean
an
office
such
as
to
fill
a
vacancy
on
the
bench
or
to
fill
a
--
mr.
lester
evens
he
could
not
to
fill
a
vacancy
on
the
bench
or
could
not
to
fill
a
vacancy
in
the
legislature.
mr.
lester
evens
yes.
mr.
lester
evens
i
know
no
governor
who
would
do
that
for
a
many
other
reasons.
i
saying
the
statutes
allow
him
too,
that
is
all
i'm
saying.
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
lester
evens
the
--
my
objection
is
to
the
classification
and
it
would
exists
regardless
to
what
modifications
there
might
be
by
legislation.
i
think
that
this
is
an
attempt
and
an
endeavor
to
take
a
large
segment
of
the
population
of
the
state
of
new
york
and
to
say
to
those
people
you
cannot
work
in
certain
jobs.
mr.
lester
evens
yes.
mr.
lester
evens
yes.
mr.
lester
evens
i
have
some
difficulty
with
that
because
i
think
that
once
we
get
into
qualifications
and
making
divisions
then
we
are
no
longer
performing
a
judicial
function.
we
apparently
are
performing
an
administrative
or
executive
function
or
legislative
function
which
can
very
well
be
handled
by
a
very,
very
sophisticated
and
substantial
body
the
commissioner
and
his
department
of
civil
service
and
that
certainly
he
could
set
forth
reasonable
criteria
of
any
kind.
if
i
may
point
out
mr.
chief
justice,
this
statute
was
originally
amended
to
exclude
non-citizens
in
1939.
the
statute
had
been
on
the
books
for
many
years
before
that
without
any
reference
to
it.
however,
the
commissioner
on
his
own
had
been
discriminating
against
aliens
and
in
fact
it
was
recommended
that
this
particular
law
be
pass
the
amendments
requiring
citizen
to
be
in
a
competitive
civil
service
class
because
the
commissioner
have
been
doing
something
all
along
which
the
legislature
had
not
mandated.
now,
this
was
one
of
the
letters
that
we
had
found
in
the
bill
jacket.
now,
it
seems
to
me
that
if
we
have
before
us
today
the
1939
law
before
it
was
amended
and
the
commissioner
himself
was
discriminating
broadly
against
an
entire
class.
we
would
be
making
the
very
same
argument
whether
it
was
enacted
or
not.
thank
you
very
much.
