justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
fleishman,
if
we
said
in
roth
that
obscenity
as
such
as
not
protected
by
the
first
amendment,
why
need
the
state
to
show
what
you
call
a
state
interest
in
order--
if
it’s
dealing
with
what
is
arguably
obscene.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
then
you’re
saying
that
what
we
said
in
roth
isn’t
entirely
correct.
if
a
person
has
a
right
to
read
an
obscene
book,
presumably
that
right
stems
from
the
first
amendment
as
incorporating
by
the
fourteenth.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
would
you
require
every
single
exercise
the
state
police
power--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
to
be
justified
on
that
source?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
supposing
the
state
decides
to
build
on
land
that
it
owns
a
large
freeway
that
obscures
your
view
of
the
sunset
from
your
backyard.
now,
would
you
say
the
state
has
to
show
a
compelling
state
interest
to
cut
off
that
view?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
are
you
suggesting
that,
mr.
mcconnell,
the
very
use
of
the
term
“community
standards”
in
roth
may
have
suggested
something
other
than
a
national
standard?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
fleishman,
under
that
which
is
then
the
right
of
the
reader
rather
than
the
seller,
i
take
it
that
the
state
may
limit
a
17-year-old’s
right
to
read
in
a
way
that
it
can’t
limit
an
adult’s
right
to
read.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
of
course,
there,
the
theory
was
selling
and
purveying
rather
than
the
right
to
read,
wasn’t
it?
