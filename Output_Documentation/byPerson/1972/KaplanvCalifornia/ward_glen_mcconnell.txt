mr.
ward
glen
mcconnell
may
it
please
the
court,
mr.
chief
justice.
it
seems
to
me
that
all
petitioner
wants
in
this
case
is
that
this
court
should
scuttle
roth
and
15
years
of
cases
following
roth
including
reidel,
including
37
photographs
which
are
less
than
a
year-and-a
half
since
they
were
decided.
now,
petitioner
perceived
something
in
stanley
versus
georgia
which
this
court
has
held
already
does
not
exist.
his
arguments
already
been
presented
to
the
california
supreme
court
in
people
versus
burrows,
and
they
considered
his
argument
to
be
highly
concatenated.
if
i
understand
him
correctly,
he
is
saying,
number
one,
it’s
alright
to
sell
obscenity
to
a
consenting
adult
and,
number
two,
if
you
sell
it
to
a
consenting
adult,
it’s
not
obscene
and,
number
three,
he
asserts
that
roth
is
still
the
law
of
the
land
and
obscenity
is
still
not
protected
and
he
says
he
doesn’t
challenge
roth.
to
me,
this
is
somewhat
confusing.
now,
there
are
some
facts
in
this
case
which
mr.
fleishman
didn’t
stress
which
i
feel
should
be
stressed.
i
think
the
conversation
in
the
bookstore
between
the
officer
and
petitioner
was
a
little
more
involved
than
what
mr.
fleishman
has
stated
here.
it’s
all
covered
in
detail
in
the
briefs.
i
think
this
case
is
unusual
in
the
sense
that
commercial
exploitation
exists
in
this
case
to
a
much
greater
degree,
at
least
in
the
record,
than
it
has
in
other
cases.
i
think
it’s
invalid
for
mr.
fleishman
to
argue
to
this
court
that
obscenity
today
in
the
united
states
is
not
being
thrust
on
an
unwilling
public.
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
the
public
is
complaining.
the
public
did
complain,
according
to
the
record,
about
mr.
kaplan
and
that’s
why
the
police
went
there.
at
the
time
this
case
arose,
there
was
some-250,
i
call
them
dirty
bookstores.
if
mr.
fleishman
wants
to
call
them
adult
bookstores,
okay.
there
are
250
in
the
city
of
los
angeles
alone.
there
just
are
not
enough
policemen
assigned
to
the
bike
squad
to
cover
the
dirty
bookstores
in
all
the
other
parts
of
their
assignment
for
them
to
go
around
aggressively
enforcing
the
laws
against
pornography,
and
the
record
shows
that
the
only
reason
they
went
to
mr.
kaplan’s
bookstore
was
because
they
have
received
complaints
from
the
public
and
complaints
from
governmental
people
to
whom
the
public
had
complained.
mr.
ward
glen
mcconnell
not
for
that
specific
purpose.
they
do
have
a
special
squad
within
their
organization
that
does
work
on
nothing
but
pornography,
but
it’s
just
a
handful
of
men.
i
believe
they
are
no
more
than
about
six
or
eight
men
assigned
to
that.
most
of
their
time
is
taken
up
with
conducting
a
survey
in
the
state
to
determine
contemporary
community
standards.
there
is
no
legal
method
in
california
wherein
the
police
can
do
anything
other
than
use
the
statute
before
this
court
to
keep
the
public
from
being
offended
by
the
pornographic
booksellers.
mr.
ward
glen
mcconnell
well,
for
the
most
part,
there
especially
trained
for
porno--
the
few
that
works
on
them
would
be
specially
trained
for
pornographic
literature
to
some
extent.
it
depends
on
what
you
mean
by
special
training.
that’s
what
they
call
the
administrative
device
commission.
there
are
17
vice
divisions
geographically
in
los
angeles
and
there
is
an
administrative
vice
division
and
these
men,
along
their
duties,
supervise
and
train
the
other
vice
officers
in
the
city
and
conduct
a
special
investigation.
they
work
in
all
kinds
of
vice,
but
there
would
be
just
a
handful
that
would
be
assigned
to
pornography.
in
this
case,
for
instance,
the
witness
blackwell
would
be
one
of
these
men
and
the
record
reflects
what
kind
of
training
is
fairly
typical
for
these
men.
at
the
present
time,
one
of
the
men
i
believe
is
a
psychologist.
it
just
happens
to
be
that
he
is
a
policeman
who
is
a
psychologist.
mr.
ward
glen
mcconnell
the--
mr.
ward
glen
mcconnell
it
wasn’t
gone
into
great
detail
in
the
record,
but
the
people
were
complaining
that
obscene
books
were
being
sold
from
this
bookstore.
the
record
is
clear
to
me
at
least--
mr.
ward
glen
mcconnell
well,
the
record
only
reflects
that
the
complaint
had
been
turned
over
to
sergeant
schidel.
he
was
assigned
to
investigate
to
see
if
there
was
any
substance
to
the
compliant.
mr.
ward
glen
mcconnell
he
stated,
as
i
recall,
that
there
had
been
complaints
from
citizens
that
mr.
kaplan
was
selling
obscene
books.
mr.
ward
glen
mcconnell
no,
just
selling
obscene
books
from
his
store.
the
record
doesn’t
show
to
whom
he
was
selling.
mr.
ward
glen
mcconnell
i
think
i
know
what
you’re
driving
at.
mr.
ward
glen
mcconnell
well,
the
answer
is
yes
to
some
extent.
the
record
shows,
for
instance,
that
there’s
some
kind
of
a
sign
that
minors
can’t
enter.
mr.
ward
glen
mcconnell
cannot.
mr.
ward
glen
mcconnell
cannot
enter
the
store.
there’s
nothing
in
the
record
to
show
that
mr.
kaplan
ever
did
or
did
not
sell
a
book
to
a
minor.
i
personally
would
be
very
surprised
if
he
did.
that’s
not
his
business,
very
frankly.
little
children
don’t
go
out
and
try
to
buy
this
kind
of
books
because--
mr.
ward
glen
mcconnell
as
i
recall--
mr.
ward
glen
mcconnell
inside
the
store,
he
did.
i
don’t
recall
what
the
record
reflects
with
respect
to
what
the
store
looked
like
from
the
street
other
than
he
had
the
usual
signs
that
it
was
an
adult
bookstore
and
so
on
that
you
see
here
in
washington
or
anywhere
else.
mr.
ward
glen
mcconnell
i’ve
gone
into
it
in
my
brief
and
made
reference
to
it
there.
mr.
ward
glen
mcconnell
it’s
not
a
particularly
detailed
area.
mr.
ward
glen
mcconnell
no,
i
recall
more
than
that.
mr.
ward
glen
mcconnell
i
think
it
was
at
page
38
of
the
transcript.
mr.
ward
glen
mcconnell
it
says
the
purpose
was
to
investigate
citizens’
complaints
regarding
obscene
matter
being
sold
at
that
location
and,
later
on,
either
board
or
cross
examination
was
brought
out
that
the
complaints
came
to
him
via
a
city
councilman’s
office
and
the
people
had
apparently
complained
to
the
city
councilman.
going
on
with
this
point,
i
think
it’s
interesting
to
note
in
the
los
angeles
times
sunday
past.
there
was
an
article.
apparently,
the
people
are
sorry
that
they’ve
gone
ahead
and
allowed
the
public
distribution
of
pornography
there
because
it
has
become
a
nuisance
that
there’s
a
danger
of
it
becoming
here
in
the
united
states
and
in
california,
in
los
angeles
in
particular.
now,
mr.
fleishman’s
theory
on
its
face,
i
think,
has
some
sort
of
validity,
that
is,
it
would
seem
reasonable
that
one
could
control
sales
to
minors.
there
is
a
possibility
of
the
chilling
effect.
there’s
a
possibility
of
the
prior
restraint
though
if
the
state
attempts
to
license
bookstores
and
place
them
in
the
same
manner
that
it
does
with
alcohol.
of
course,
with
alcohol,
you
can
never
have
a
problem
with
prior
restraint.
the
reason
the
theory
doesn’t
work
is,
very
simply,
if
an
adult
goes
into
a
liquor
store
and
buys
a
bottle
of
bourbon,
he
certainly
is
not
going
to
give
it
away
to
children
and,
most
times,
he’s
not
even
going
to
give
it
away
to
other
adults.
he’s
buying
it
to
consume
it
himself.
once
he
has
drunk
it
all
up,
it’s
gone
and
he
throws
away
an
empty
bottle.
it’s
not
the
same
thing
with
pornography.
it
doesn’t
self-destruct
in
five
seconds
and
it’s
not
biodegradable.
it
simply
sits
there
until
he
throws
it
in
his
trash
and
then
you
have
the
problem
of
redistribution
because
there
is
control.
there
are
controls
now
in
the
area
of
pornography.
you
don’t
have
much
of
a
redistribution
problem.
i
anticipate
mr.
fleishman
will
mention
butler
versus
michigan,
and
i
don’t
want
anybody
to
think
that
i’m
implying
that
that’s
bad
law.
i
think
it’s
good
law.
but,
still
in
all,
it
goes
to
the
validity
of
his
argument
that
it
should
be
okay
if
petitioner
does
not
sell
it
to
children
because
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
if
you
have
wider
distribution,
it
means
wider
distribution
everywhere
eventually.
the
other
factual
area
in
this
case
that
was
important
to
me
was
that
petitioner
was
exploiting
his
materials.
he
sold
to
the
police
on
two
different
occasions
three
different
types
of
material:
film,
photo
magazine,
and
a
book.
petitioner
was
charged
with
all
three-in-one
complaints.
he
was
tried
in
one
case
and
the
jury
was
shown
what
mr.
fleishman
calls
comparables.
in
the
case
of
suite
69,
an
entire
book
called
“adam
and
eve,”
held
not
obscene
by
this
court
in
white
versus
minnesota
was
read
to
the
jury.
the
jury
was
instructed
that
they
should
consider
the
fact
that
this
court
held
adam
and
eve
to
be
not
obscene
in
considering
whether
or
not
suite
69
was
obscene
and
the
jury,
considering
all
the
different
comparables
and
all
the
factors
in
the
case,
acquitted
petitioner
of
selling
an
obscene
movie,
of
selling
an
obscene
photo
magazine
and
yet
held,
based
on
what
they
had
heard,
that
the
book
is
obscene.
the
manner
in
which
petitioner
and
other
pornography
peddlers
in
this
country
are
selling
their
materials
these
days,
i
think,
speaks
volumes
for
its
social
value
and
i
would
question
whether
a
jury
trial
has
any
validity
in
an
obscenity
case
if
the
petitioner
can
eventually
come
to
this
court
and
say
“well,
the
jury
while
having
all
the
benefit
of
all
that
testimony
and
evidence
should
now
be
overruled
because
of
some
different
standard.”
if
stanley
versus
georgia
has
any
meaning,
if
reidel
and
37
photographs
have
any
meaning,
and
if
they
mean
what
mr.
fleishman
says
they
mean,
then
i
am
truly
confounded.
i
think
the
basic
rule
of
roth
is
still
good.
i’m
frankly
surprised
that
a
case
such
as
stanley
versus
georgia
ever
had
to
come
to
this
court,
it
would
seem
to
me
that
any
sixth
grade
child
would’ve
told
the
police
in
georgia
that
you
can’t
control
a
man
as
such
and
he
wouldn’t
have
had
to
base
it
on
the
constitution.
i
don’t
think
and
i
submit
that
this
court
should
not
think
so
either,
that
because
there
is
any
right
to
think
and
an
absolute
right
to
read
what
you
want
in
the
privacy
of
your
own
home
that
that
means
there’s
a
right
to
sell
pornography,
and
there
isn’t
any
logical
connection
between
stanley’s
right
to
read
and
petitioner’s
right,
on
the
other
hand,
to
conduct
a
public
merchandising
of
the
material
that
stanley
might
want
to
read.
roth
and
reidel
simply
do
not
agree
with
stanley.
i
do
not
believe
that
birth
control
cases
are
controlling
in
this
case
either.
in
the
birth
control
cases,
in
griswold
and
eisenstadt,
the
court
was
dealing
with
dissemination
of
ideas
and
information
which
the
public
at
large
clearly
attaches
great
social
value
too.
pornography
simply
is
not
a
matter
that
so
fundamentally
affects
the
people
in
this
country
as
decisions
of
whether
or
not
they
should
keep
their
children.
what
petitioner
is
saying
in
this
case
essentially
is
that
the
court
should
throw
out
roth.
he
is
saying
that
there--
that
roth
was
wrong
when
it
said
there
was
no
need
for
the
state
to
show
a
clear
and
present
danger
based
on
any
compelling
state
interest,
and
he
says
that
this
court
has
limited
the
state
only
to
interest
in
stanley
versus
georgia.
now,
the
court
gave
two
examples
in
stanley
versus
georgia,
but
didn’t
place
any
limit
on
what
this
compelling
state
interest
may
be,
if
any,
and
i
think
it’s
up
to
the
legislature
and
not
the
courts
to
determine
if
the
interest
exists
and,
if
so,
what
they
are.
i
would
point
out
that
acceptance
of
petitioners
here
in
this
case
would
put
a
place
on
the
burden
on
the
prosecution
the
same
as
it
is
now,
and
yet
they’d
be
involved
with
the
issues
of
where
pornography
was
being
sold
to
children
or
to
consenting
adults,
and
i
suggest
that
this
lies
in
the
face
of
ginsberg
versus
new
york
and
butler
versus
michigan.
some
other
issues
that
were
raised
in
petitioner’s
brief
i
would
like
to
address
very
briefly,
number
one
is
the
question
of
the
national
standards
versus
state
standards
or
other
local
standard.
i
see
no
compelling
reason
why
the
states
should
be
denied
local
control
over
all
aspects
of
obscenity,
and
i
see
no
compelling
reason
why
a
national
standard
of
contemporary
community
standard
should
apply.
mr.
ward
glen
mcconnell
it’s
true.
it’s
a
national
constitution.
mr.
ward
glen
mcconnell
it
is
correct
that
it
is
the
national
constitution
and
that
is
really
the
only
argument
for
a
national
standard.
mr.
ward
glen
mcconnell
yes,
it
is.[laughter]
the
question
is,
though,
suppose
the
national
standard
were
to
be
applied
in
california
today,
contemporary
community
standards
have
to
be
proven
by
expert
testimony,
and
the
way
this
is
most
commonly
done
is
by
having
the
police
department
continuously
conduct
a
poll
which
we
maintain
is
scientifically
accurate
of
the
entire
state
of
california.
they
do
this
every
six
months,
and
they
ask
people
what
are
the
standards
in
your
community?
and
then,
they
come
into
court
and
they
set
this
for
us.
now,
doesn’t
it
stand
to
reason
that
california
standards
are
essentially
similar
or
more
liberal
than
the
national
standard?
why
should
prosecution
be
put
to
the
burden
of
trying
to
prove
this
sort
of
thing
over
the
entire
nation?
it’s
been
questioned
in
this
court
before
whether
or
not
there
is
such
a
thing
as
the
national
standard
and,
if
so,
whether
it’s
too
illusive
to
determine.
i
think
that
it
could
be
established
by
expert
testimony
in
a
california
court
that
national
standards
of
tolerance
in
the
areas
of
nudity
or
sex
might
be
set
by
a
book
such
as
essentialist
woman
or
by
a
magazine
such
as
playboy,
that
anything
beyond
that
would
offend
national
standards,
at
least
in
california.
mr.
ward
glen
mcconnell
no,
i
would
not.
mr.
ward
glen
mcconnell
the
view
that
i
have
is
that
the
court
in
roth
defined
obscenity
and
it
merely
said
it
goes
beyond
contemporary
community
standards,
and
if--
mr.
ward
glen
mcconnell
you
took
the
words
right
out
of
my
mouth.
that’s
exactly
what
i
intended
to
suggest.
i--
if
they
use
the
word
“community,”
what
did
they
mean?
obviously,
if
it’s
a
national
standard
then
there’s
a
better
way
to
phrase
it
than
saying
“contemporary
community
standards.”
mr.
ward
glen
mcconnell
yes,
he
did,
and
i
submit
that
if
you--
on
the
one
hand,
if
you
make
the
community
too
small,
then
you
have
the
same
situation
analogous
to
butler
versus
michigan
where
you’re
reducing
what
people
can
read
to
a
very
limited
sort
of
audience.
if
you
are
going
to
make
it
a
nationwide
standard,
then
petitioner
also
has
a
valid
logical
complaint,
and
that
is
to--
he
is
doing
business
in
los
angeles,
a
community
of
some--
well,
the
metropolitan
area
of
some-10
million
people
in
standards
that
apply
in
toluca,
minnesota
or
yakama,
washington
or
wherever,
all
have
the
effect
on
how
he
is
going
to
do
business
in
los
angeles
and--
mr.
ward
glen
mcconnell
no.
mr.
ward
glen
mcconnell
no,
i
think
that
one
or
two--
mr.
ward
glen
mcconnell
one
or
two
is
obviously
too
small.
in
california,
it’s
a
community
of
some-20
million
people.
that’s
the
community
by
which--
mr.
ward
glen
mcconnell
no,
not
at
all
because
i
would
assume
that
the
publications
of
the
john
burk
society
wouldn’t
appeal
to
the
prurient
interest.
mr.
ward
glen
mcconnell
i’m
not
sure
i
understand
the
question,
mr.
justice
stewart.
mr.
ward
glen
mcconnell
the
argument
is
simply
that
there
is
no
logical
reason
to
me
why
it
is
more
feared
to
somebody
such
as
the
petitioner
to
say
that
community
standards
in
the
nation
as
a
whole
have
to
be
determined.
this
court
has
never
answered
the
question
until
now
which
standard
should
apply,
and
i
would
assume
that
perhaps
it
wishes
to
answer
the
question
in
this
term.
if
it
does,
then
some
of
the
points
that
i
think
the
court
should
consider
are,
number
one,
what
did
the
court
mean
previously
when
it
used
the
word
“community”?
number
two
is
the
fear
to
incorporate
standards
of
very
small
towns
or
very
rural
areas
against
petitioner
when
he
is
doing
business
in
a
city
such
as
los
angeles
or
washington
d.c.
mr.
ward
glen
mcconnell
no,
if
he
makes
the
community
too
small
or--
mr.
ward
glen
mcconnell
no,
i
don’t
think
so.
i
think
the
community,
if
it’s
too
small
or
too
large,
either
way,
is
an
analogous
situation
of
butler
versus
michigan.
you
then
have
the
petitioner
in
the
standpoint
of
having
to
hear
what
he
sold
to
the
standards
of
a
very
limited
audience
or
in
a
very
limited
way.
in
essence,
the
national
standard
argument
is
all
tied
in
with
the
stanley
versus
georgia
argument
because
what
mr.
stanley
was
saying
a
few
moments
ago
is
that
the
prurience
and
so
on
should
be
judged
by
the
intended
recipients,
by
a
consulting
adult.
mr.
ward
glen
mcconnell
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
ward
glen
mcconnell
where
did
that
point
come
up
in
stanley?
mr.
ward
glen
mcconnell
in
mr.
fleishman’s
argument,
sir?
mr.
ward
glen
mcconnell
no,
i--
if
i
did,
i--
mr.
ward
glen
mcconnell
if
i
did,
the
wrong
words
came
out
of
my
mouth.
mr.
fleishman--
mr.
ward
glen
mcconnell
no.
mr.
ward
glen
mcconnell
no,
of
course
not.
but,
roth
says
and
reidel
says
that
the
state
of
california
can
stop
petitioner
from
selling
it
to
stanley.
mr.
ward
glen
mcconnell
well,
i
don’t
know
the
practicalities
of
trying
to
sell
somebody
a
brand
new
package.
they’d
have
to
know
what
was
inside
before
they
take
it.
mr.
ward
glen
mcconnell
technically,
under
the
statute
it
would,
but
it’s
one
of
those
forty
things
that
just
could--
mr.
ward
glen
mcconnell
i
think
the
way
the
statute
is
written,
it
would
in--
mr.
ward
glen
mcconnell
well,
then
i
think
you’re
in
an
area
that’s
already
been
settled
by
this
court.
it’s
similar
to
stanley
versus
georgia,
but
it’s
more
similar
to
the
case
involving
the
people
of
new
york
that
were
sending
films
of
each
other
back
and
forth
privately
in
the
mail.
that’s
a
stanley
versus
georgia
type
situation
then.
to
be
perfectly
frank,
the
only
way
that
these
cases
arise
is
when
the
police
get
complaints
and
they
act
on
it.
and,
they
got
complaints
about
petitioner
and
they
went
out
to
investigate
it.
mr.
ward
glen
mcconnell
well,
i
would
have
to
disagree.
just
walking
down
the
street
here
in
washington,
if
you
walk
passed
an
adult
bookstore
in
the
evening,
there’s
somebody
usually
out
in
the
front,
it
happened
to
me
last
night,
and
says
“come
on
in
and
see
what
we’ve
got.”
mr.
ward
glen
mcconnell
no.
this
record
--
mr.
ward
glen
mcconnell
this
record--
mr.
ward
glen
mcconnell
according
to
this
record
that’s
true,
yes,
but
i
think
under
stanley
and
under--
versus
reidel,
it
doesn’t
make
any
difference
that
the
police
had
to
go
find
out.
that’s
how
they
make
their
case.
the
fact
that
the
police
bought
the
book
doesn’t
have
anything
to
do
with
the
fact
that
he
might
have
been
a
consenting
adult.
it
has
something
to
do
with
the
search
and
seizure
law.
if
the
police
buy
the
book,
that’s
how
they
obtain
their
evidence
and
that’s
how
they
obtain
the
facts--
mr.
ward
glen
mcconnell
not
in
the
sense
that
mr.
fleishman
is
talking
about.
he
was
a
man
doing
his
job.
i
doubt
very
much
if
he
wanted
to
buy
that
book
for
himself
or
if
he’d
like
to
read
it.
mr.
ward
glen
mcconnell
no,
the
seller
assumed
he
was.
that
was
correct,
but
i
don’t
believe
the
record--
mr.
ward
glen
mcconnell
that’s
right.
mr.
ward
glen
mcconnell
that’s
right,
but
just
briefly,
if
i
may,
i
think
that
the
obscenity
of
suite
69
is
clear
from
reading
it
and
the
jury’s
judgment
here
was
based
on
comparable
evidence
which
this
court
had
considered
previously.
it’s
obviously
different
from
other
books.
there
is
no
way
that
the
community
standards
could
not
be
violated
because
nothing
can
go
further.
to
say
the
book
is
not
obscene
is
to
say
that
no
book
without
pictures,
in
other
words
a
written
novel
type
book,
could
be
obscene
and
that
there
are
no
community
standards.
it
would
be
nice
for
mr.
fleishman
and
myself
if
this
court
could
decide
whether
social
importance
is
an
element
that
the
prosecution
has
to
prove
as
part
of
its
case
or
whether
or
not
it’s
just
part
of
the
definition
that’s
stated
in
roth.
it
seems
to
me
that
roth
created
somewhat
of
a
presumption
that
if
the
other
elements
of
obscenity
were
met
and
social
value
is
presumed
not
to
exist,
the
california
court,
the
court
below,
interpreted
that
not
to
be
the
law
and
followed
the
minority
opinion
in
memoirs
in
a
book
versus
attorney
general
as
it
also
followed
the
so-called
pondering
aspects
of
that
book.
i
submit
that
if
this
court
could
say
that
a
book
such
as
fanny
held
might
be
considered
obscene
under
certain
circumstances
of
sale
then,
certainly,
that
book
being
very
tamed
compared
to
suite
69,
certainly
suite
69
and
the
circumstances
under
which
it
was
sold
does
have
to
be
considered
obscene.
i
think
that
there
would--
that
this
really
isn’t
a
question
of
pondering.
the
court
below
did
not
talk
about
ginsberg.
it
talked
about
a
book
versus
attorney
general.
ginsberg
couldn’t
have
been
convicted
under
california
law
because
you
can’t
prove
the
other
elements
of
obscenity
by
the
statements
of
the
seller.
you
can
only
prove
social
value
that
way.
i
think
that
the
opinion
of
the
court
below
shows
they
didn’t
rely
on
the
california
statute,
but
if
this
court
thinks
they
did,
i
would
point
out
that
its
appearance
is,
to
me
at
least,
is
that
of
a
rule
of
evidence
that
codifies
the
law
that
was
set
forth
in
opinions
coming
from
this
court
long
before
petitioner
was
arrested,
and
it
did
become
effective
as
a
statute
in
los
angeles
quite
a
long
time
before
he
was
actually
tried.
it
didn’t
change
any
prior
law.
therefore,
i
would
submit
under
the
facts
of
this
case
that
the
judgment
should
be
affirmed.
thank
you.
mr.
ward
glen
mcconnell
may
it
please
the
court,
mr.
chief
justice.
it
seems
to
me
that
all
petitioner
wants
in
this
case
is
that
this
court
should
scuttle
roth
and
15
years
of
cases
following
roth
including
reidel,
including
37
photographs
which
are
less
than
a
year-and-a
half
since
they
were
decided.
now,
petitioner
perceived
something
in
stanley
versus
georgia
which
this
court
has
held
already
does
not
exist.
his
arguments
already
been
presented
to
the
california
supreme
court
in
people
versus
burrows,
and
they
considered
his
argument
to
be
highly
concatenated.
if
i
understand
him
correctly,
he
is
saying,
number
one,
it’s
alright
to
sell
obscenity
to
a
consenting
adult
and,
number
two,
if
you
sell
it
to
a
consenting
adult,
it’s
not
obscene
and,
number
three,
he
asserts
that
roth
is
still
the
law
of
the
land
and
obscenity
is
still
not
protected
and
he
says
he
doesn’t
challenge
roth.
to
me,
this
is
somewhat
confusing.
now,
there
are
some
facts
in
this
case
which
mr.
fleishman
didn’t
stress
which
i
feel
should
be
stressed.
i
think
the
conversation
in
the
bookstore
between
the
officer
and
petitioner
was
a
little
more
involved
than
what
mr.
fleishman
has
stated
here.
it’s
all
covered
in
detail
in
the
briefs.
i
think
this
case
is
unusual
in
the
sense
that
commercial
exploitation
exists
in
this
case
to
a
much
greater
degree,
at
least
in
the
record,
than
it
has
in
other
cases.
i
think
it’s
invalid
for
mr.
fleishman
to
argue
to
this
court
that
obscenity
today
in
the
united
states
is
not
being
thrust
on
an
unwilling
public.
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
the
public
is
complaining.
the
public
did
complain,
according
to
the
record,
about
mr.
kaplan
and
that’s
why
the
police
went
there.
at
the
time
this
case
arose,
there
was
some-250,
i
call
them
dirty
bookstores.
if
mr.
fleishman
wants
to
call
them
adult
bookstores,
okay.
there
are
250
in
the
city
of
los
angeles
alone.
there
just
are
not
enough
policemen
assigned
to
the
bike
squad
to
cover
the
dirty
bookstores
in
all
the
other
parts
of
their
assignment
for
them
to
go
around
aggressively
enforcing
the
laws
against
pornography,
and
the
record
shows
that
the
only
reason
they
went
to
mr.
kaplan’s
bookstore
was
because
they
have
received
complaints
from
the
public
and
complaints
from
governmental
people
to
whom
the
public
had
complained.
mr.
ward
glen
mcconnell
not
for
that
specific
purpose.
they
do
have
a
special
squad
within
their
organization
that
does
work
on
nothing
but
pornography,
but
it’s
just
a
handful
of
men.
i
believe
they
are
no
more
than
about
six
or
eight
men
assigned
to
that.
most
of
their
time
is
taken
up
with
conducting
a
survey
in
the
state
to
determine
contemporary
community
standards.
there
is
no
legal
method
in
california
wherein
the
police
can
do
anything
other
than
use
the
statute
before
this
court
to
keep
the
public
from
being
offended
by
the
pornographic
booksellers.
mr.
ward
glen
mcconnell
well,
for
the
most
part,
there
especially
trained
for
porno--
the
few
that
works
on
them
would
be
specially
trained
for
pornographic
literature
to
some
extent.
it
depends
on
what
you
mean
by
special
training.
that’s
what
they
call
the
administrative
device
commission.
there
are
17
vice
divisions
geographically
in
los
angeles
and
there
is
an
administrative
vice
division
and
these
men,
along
their
duties,
supervise
and
train
the
other
vice
officers
in
the
city
and
conduct
a
special
investigation.
they
work
in
all
kinds
of
vice,
but
there
would
be
just
a
handful
that
would
be
assigned
to
pornography.
in
this
case,
for
instance,
the
witness
blackwell
would
be
one
of
these
men
and
the
record
reflects
what
kind
of
training
is
fairly
typical
for
these
men.
at
the
present
time,
one
of
the
men
i
believe
is
a
psychologist.
it
just
happens
to
be
that
he
is
a
policeman
who
is
a
psychologist.
mr.
ward
glen
mcconnell
the--
mr.
ward
glen
mcconnell
it
wasn’t
gone
into
great
detail
in
the
record,
but
the
people
were
complaining
that
obscene
books
were
being
sold
from
this
bookstore.
the
record
is
clear
to
me
at
least--
mr.
ward
glen
mcconnell
well,
the
record
only
reflects
that
the
complaint
had
been
turned
over
to
sergeant
schidel.
he
was
assigned
to
investigate
to
see
if
there
was
any
substance
to
the
compliant.
mr.
ward
glen
mcconnell
he
stated,
as
i
recall,
that
there
had
been
complaints
from
citizens
that
mr.
kaplan
was
selling
obscene
books.
mr.
ward
glen
mcconnell
no,
just
selling
obscene
books
from
his
store.
the
record
doesn’t
show
to
whom
he
was
selling.
mr.
ward
glen
mcconnell
i
think
i
know
what
you’re
driving
at.
mr.
ward
glen
mcconnell
well,
the
answer
is
yes
to
some
extent.
the
record
shows,
for
instance,
that
there’s
some
kind
of
a
sign
that
minors
can’t
enter.
mr.
ward
glen
mcconnell
cannot.
mr.
ward
glen
mcconnell
cannot
enter
the
store.
there’s
nothing
in
the
record
to
show
that
mr.
kaplan
ever
did
or
did
not
sell
a
book
to
a
minor.
i
personally
would
be
very
surprised
if
he
did.
that’s
not
his
business,
very
frankly.
little
children
don’t
go
out
and
try
to
buy
this
kind
of
books
because--
mr.
ward
glen
mcconnell
as
i
recall--
mr.
ward
glen
mcconnell
inside
the
store,
he
did.
i
don’t
recall
what
the
record
reflects
with
respect
to
what
the
store
looked
like
from
the
street
other
than
he
had
the
usual
signs
that
it
was
an
adult
bookstore
and
so
on
that
you
see
here
in
washington
or
anywhere
else.
mr.
ward
glen
mcconnell
i’ve
gone
into
it
in
my
brief
and
made
reference
to
it
there.
mr.
ward
glen
mcconnell
it’s
not
a
particularly
detailed
area.
mr.
ward
glen
mcconnell
no,
i
recall
more
than
that.
mr.
ward
glen
mcconnell
i
think
it
was
at
page
38
of
the
transcript.
mr.
ward
glen
mcconnell
it
says
the
purpose
was
to
investigate
citizens’
complaints
regarding
obscene
matter
being
sold
at
that
location
and,
later
on,
either
board
or
cross
examination
was
brought
out
that
the
complaints
came
to
him
via
a
city
councilman’s
office
and
the
people
had
apparently
complained
to
the
city
councilman.
going
on
with
this
point,
i
think
it’s
interesting
to
note
in
the
los
angeles
times
sunday
past.
there
was
an
article.
apparently,
the
people
are
sorry
that
they’ve
gone
ahead
and
allowed
the
public
distribution
of
pornography
there
because
it
has
become
a
nuisance
that
there’s
a
danger
of
it
becoming
here
in
the
united
states
and
in
california,
in
los
angeles
in
particular.
now,
mr.
fleishman’s
theory
on
its
face,
i
think,
has
some
sort
of
validity,
that
is,
it
would
seem
reasonable
that
one
could
control
sales
to
minors.
there
is
a
possibility
of
the
chilling
effect.
there’s
a
possibility
of
the
prior
restraint
though
if
the
state
attempts
to
license
bookstores
and
place
them
in
the
same
manner
that
it
does
with
alcohol.
of
course,
with
alcohol,
you
can
never
have
a
problem
with
prior
restraint.
the
reason
the
theory
doesn’t
work
is,
very
simply,
if
an
adult
goes
into
a
liquor
store
and
buys
a
bottle
of
bourbon,
he
certainly
is
not
going
to
give
it
away
to
children
and,
most
times,
he’s
not
even
going
to
give
it
away
to
other
adults.
he’s
buying
it
to
consume
it
himself.
once
he
has
drunk
it
all
up,
it’s
gone
and
he
throws
away
an
empty
bottle.
it’s
not
the
same
thing
with
pornography.
it
doesn’t
self-destruct
in
five
seconds
and
it’s
not
biodegradable.
it
simply
sits
there
until
he
throws
it
in
his
trash
and
then
you
have
the
problem
of
redistribution
because
there
is
control.
there
are
controls
now
in
the
area
of
pornography.
you
don’t
have
much
of
a
redistribution
problem.
i
anticipate
mr.
fleishman
will
mention
butler
versus
michigan,
and
i
don’t
want
anybody
to
think
that
i’m
implying
that
that’s
bad
law.
i
think
it’s
good
law.
but,
still
in
all,
it
goes
to
the
validity
of
his
argument
that
it
should
be
okay
if
petitioner
does
not
sell
it
to
children
because
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
if
you
have
wider
distribution,
it
means
wider
distribution
everywhere
eventually.
the
other
factual
area
in
this
case
that
was
important
to
me
was
that
petitioner
was
exploiting
his
materials.
he
sold
to
the
police
on
two
different
occasions
three
different
types
of
material:
film,
photo
magazine,
and
a
book.
petitioner
was
charged
with
all
three-in-one
complaints.
he
was
tried
in
one
case
and
the
jury
was
shown
what
mr.
fleishman
calls
comparables.
in
the
case
of
suite
69,
an
entire
book
called
“adam
and
eve,”
held
not
obscene
by
this
court
in
white
versus
minnesota
was
read
to
the
jury.
the
jury
was
instructed
that
they
should
consider
the
fact
that
this
court
held
adam
and
eve
to
be
not
obscene
in
considering
whether
or
not
suite
69
was
obscene
and
the
jury,
considering
all
the
different
comparables
and
all
the
factors
in
the
case,
acquitted
petitioner
of
selling
an
obscene
movie,
of
selling
an
obscene
photo
magazine
and
yet
held,
based
on
what
they
had
heard,
that
the
book
is
obscene.
the
manner
in
which
petitioner
and
other
pornography
peddlers
in
this
country
are
selling
their
materials
these
days,
i
think,
speaks
volumes
for
its
social
value
and
i
would
question
whether
a
jury
trial
has
any
validity
in
an
obscenity
case
if
the
petitioner
can
eventually
come
to
this
court
and
say
“well,
the
jury
while
having
all
the
benefit
of
all
that
testimony
and
evidence
should
now
be
overruled
because
of
some
different
standard.”
if
stanley
versus
georgia
has
any
meaning,
if
reidel
and
37
photographs
have
any
meaning,
and
if
they
mean
what
mr.
fleishman
says
they
mean,
then
i
am
truly
confounded.
i
think
the
basic
rule
of
roth
is
still
good.
i’m
frankly
surprised
that
a
case
such
as
stanley
versus
georgia
ever
had
to
come
to
this
court,
it
would
seem
to
me
that
any
sixth
grade
child
would’ve
told
the
police
in
georgia
that
you
can’t
control
a
man
as
such
and
he
wouldn’t
have
had
to
base
it
on
the
constitution.
i
don’t
think
and
i
submit
that
this
court
should
not
think
so
either,
that
because
there
is
any
right
to
think
and
an
absolute
right
to
read
what
you
want
in
the
privacy
of
your
own
home
that
that
means
there’s
a
right
to
sell
pornography,
and
there
isn’t
any
logical
connection
between
stanley’s
right
to
read
and
petitioner’s
right,
on
the
other
hand,
to
conduct
a
public
merchandising
of
the
material
that
stanley
might
want
to
read.
roth
and
reidel
simply
do
not
agree
with
stanley.
i
do
not
believe
that
birth
control
cases
are
controlling
in
this
case
either.
in
the
birth
control
cases,
in
griswold
and
eisenstadt,
the
court
was
dealing
with
dissemination
of
ideas
and
information
which
the
public
at
large
clearly
attaches
great
social
value
too.
pornography
simply
is
not
a
matter
that
so
fundamentally
affects
the
people
in
this
country
as
decisions
of
whether
or
not
they
should
keep
their
children.
what
petitioner
is
saying
in
this
case
essentially
is
that
the
court
should
throw
out
roth.
he
is
saying
that
there--
that
roth
was
wrong
when
it
said
there
was
no
need
for
the
state
to
show
a
clear
and
present
danger
based
on
any
compelling
state
interest,
and
he
says
that
this
court
has
limited
the
state
only
to
interest
in
stanley
versus
georgia.
now,
the
court
gave
two
examples
in
stanley
versus
georgia,
but
didn’t
place
any
limit
on
what
this
compelling
state
interest
may
be,
if
any,
and
i
think
it’s
up
to
the
legislature
and
not
the
courts
to
determine
if
the
interest
exists
and,
if
so,
what
they
are.
i
would
point
out
that
acceptance
of
petitioners
here
in
this
case
would
put
a
place
on
the
burden
on
the
prosecution
the
same
as
it
is
now,
and
yet
they’d
be
involved
with
the
issues
of
where
pornography
was
being
sold
to
children
or
to
consenting
adults,
and
i
suggest
that
this
lies
in
the
face
of
ginsberg
versus
new
york
and
butler
versus
michigan.
some
other
issues
that
were
raised
in
petitioner’s
brief
i
would
like
to
address
very
briefly,
number
one
is
the
question
of
the
national
standards
versus
state
standards
or
other
local
standard.
i
see
no
compelling
reason
why
the
states
should
be
denied
local
control
over
all
aspects
of
obscenity,
and
i
see
no
compelling
reason
why
a
national
standard
of
contemporary
community
standard
should
apply.
mr.
ward
glen
mcconnell
it’s
true.
it’s
a
national
constitution.
mr.
ward
glen
mcconnell
it
is
correct
that
it
is
the
national
constitution
and
that
is
really
the
only
argument
for
a
national
standard.
mr.
ward
glen
mcconnell
yes,
it
is.[laughter]
the
question
is,
though,
suppose
the
national
standard
were
to
be
applied
in
california
today,
contemporary
community
standards
have
to
be
proven
by
expert
testimony,
and
the
way
this
is
most
commonly
done
is
by
having
the
police
department
continuously
conduct
a
poll
which
we
maintain
is
scientifically
accurate
of
the
entire
state
of
california.
they
do
this
every
six
months,
and
they
ask
people
what
are
the
standards
in
your
community?
and
then,
they
come
into
court
and
they
set
this
for
us.
now,
doesn’t
it
stand
to
reason
that
california
standards
are
essentially
similar
or
more
liberal
than
the
national
standard?
why
should
prosecution
be
put
to
the
burden
of
trying
to
prove
this
sort
of
thing
over
the
entire
nation?
it’s
been
questioned
in
this
court
before
whether
or
not
there
is
such
a
thing
as
the
national
standard
and,
if
so,
whether
it’s
too
illusive
to
determine.
i
think
that
it
could
be
established
by
expert
testimony
in
a
california
court
that
national
standards
of
tolerance
in
the
areas
of
nudity
or
sex
might
be
set
by
a
book
such
as
essentialist
woman
or
by
a
magazine
such
as
playboy,
that
anything
beyond
that
would
offend
national
standards,
at
least
in
california.
mr.
ward
glen
mcconnell
no,
i
would
not.
mr.
ward
glen
mcconnell
the
view
that
i
have
is
that
the
court
in
roth
defined
obscenity
and
it
merely
said
it
goes
beyond
contemporary
community
standards,
and
if--
mr.
ward
glen
mcconnell
you
took
the
words
right
out
of
my
mouth.
that’s
exactly
what
i
intended
to
suggest.
i--
if
they
use
the
word
“community,”
what
did
they
mean?
obviously,
if
it’s
a
national
standard
then
there’s
a
better
way
to
phrase
it
than
saying
“contemporary
community
standards.”
mr.
ward
glen
mcconnell
yes,
he
did,
and
i
submit
that
if
you--
on
the
one
hand,
if
you
make
the
community
too
small,
then
you
have
the
same
situation
analogous
to
butler
versus
michigan
where
you’re
reducing
what
people
can
read
to
a
very
limited
sort
of
audience.
if
you
are
going
to
make
it
a
nationwide
standard,
then
petitioner
also
has
a
valid
logical
complaint,
and
that
is
to--
he
is
doing
business
in
los
angeles,
a
community
of
some--
well,
the
metropolitan
area
of
some-10
million
people
in
standards
that
apply
in
toluca,
minnesota
or
yakama,
washington
or
wherever,
all
have
the
effect
on
how
he
is
going
to
do
business
in
los
angeles
and--
mr.
ward
glen
mcconnell
no.
mr.
ward
glen
mcconnell
no,
i
think
that
one
or
two--
mr.
ward
glen
mcconnell
one
or
two
is
obviously
too
small.
in
california,
it’s
a
community
of
some-20
million
people.
that’s
the
community
by
which--
mr.
ward
glen
mcconnell
no,
not
at
all
because
i
would
assume
that
the
publications
of
the
john
burk
society
wouldn’t
appeal
to
the
prurient
interest.
mr.
ward
glen
mcconnell
i’m
not
sure
i
understand
the
question,
mr.
justice
stewart.
mr.
ward
glen
mcconnell
the
argument
is
simply
that
there
is
no
logical
reason
to
me
why
it
is
more
feared
to
somebody
such
as
the
petitioner
to
say
that
community
standards
in
the
nation
as
a
whole
have
to
be
determined.
this
court
has
never
answered
the
question
until
now
which
standard
should
apply,
and
i
would
assume
that
perhaps
it
wishes
to
answer
the
question
in
this
term.
if
it
does,
then
some
of
the
points
that
i
think
the
court
should
consider
are,
number
one,
what
did
the
court
mean
previously
when
it
used
the
word
“community”?
number
two
is
the
fear
to
incorporate
standards
of
very
small
towns
or
very
rural
areas
against
petitioner
when
he
is
doing
business
in
a
city
such
as
los
angeles
or
washington
d.c.
mr.
ward
glen
mcconnell
no,
if
he
makes
the
community
too
small
or--
mr.
ward
glen
mcconnell
no,
i
don’t
think
so.
i
think
the
community,
if
it’s
too
small
or
too
large,
either
way,
is
an
analogous
situation
of
butler
versus
michigan.
you
then
have
the
petitioner
in
the
standpoint
of
having
to
hear
what
he
sold
to
the
standards
of
a
very
limited
audience
or
in
a
very
limited
way.
in
essence,
the
national
standard
argument
is
all
tied
in
with
the
stanley
versus
georgia
argument
because
what
mr.
stanley
was
saying
a
few
moments
ago
is
that
the
prurience
and
so
on
should
be
judged
by
the
intended
recipients,
by
a
consulting
adult.
mr.
ward
glen
mcconnell
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
ward
glen
mcconnell
where
did
that
point
come
up
in
stanley?
mr.
ward
glen
mcconnell
in
mr.
fleishman’s
argument,
sir?
mr.
ward
glen
mcconnell
no,
i--
if
i
did,
i--
mr.
ward
glen
mcconnell
if
i
did,
the
wrong
words
came
out
of
my
mouth.
mr.
fleishman--
mr.
ward
glen
mcconnell
no.
mr.
ward
glen
mcconnell
no,
of
course
not.
but,
roth
says
and
reidel
says
that
the
state
of
california
can
stop
petitioner
from
selling
it
to
stanley.
mr.
ward
glen
mcconnell
well,
i
don’t
know
the
practicalities
of
trying
to
sell
somebody
a
brand
new
package.
they’d
have
to
know
what
was
inside
before
they
take
it.
mr.
ward
glen
mcconnell
technically,
under
the
statute
it
would,
but
it’s
one
of
those
forty
things
that
just
could--
mr.
ward
glen
mcconnell
i
think
the
way
the
statute
is
written,
it
would
in--
mr.
ward
glen
mcconnell
well,
then
i
think
you’re
in
an
area
that’s
already
been
settled
by
this
court.
it’s
similar
to
stanley
versus
georgia,
but
it’s
more
similar
to
the
case
involving
the
people
of
new
york
that
were
sending
films
of
each
other
back
and
forth
privately
in
the
mail.
that’s
a
stanley
versus
georgia
type
situation
then.
to
be
perfectly
frank,
the
only
way
that
these
cases
arise
is
when
the
police
get
complaints
and
they
act
on
it.
and,
they
got
complaints
about
petitioner
and
they
went
out
to
investigate
it.
mr.
ward
glen
mcconnell
well,
i
would
have
to
disagree.
just
walking
down
the
street
here
in
washington,
if
you
walk
passed
an
adult
bookstore
in
the
evening,
there’s
somebody
usually
out
in
the
front,
it
happened
to
me
last
night,
and
says
“come
on
in
and
see
what
we’ve
got.”
mr.
ward
glen
mcconnell
no.
this
record
--
mr.
ward
glen
mcconnell
this
record--
mr.
ward
glen
mcconnell
according
to
this
record
that’s
true,
yes,
but
i
think
under
stanley
and
under--
versus
reidel,
it
doesn’t
make
any
difference
that
the
police
had
to
go
find
out.
that’s
how
they
make
their
case.
the
fact
that
the
police
bought
the
book
doesn’t
have
anything
to
do
with
the
fact
that
he
might
have
been
a
consenting
adult.
it
has
something
to
do
with
the
search
and
seizure
law.
if
the
police
buy
the
book,
that’s
how
they
obtain
their
evidence
and
that’s
how
they
obtain
the
facts--
mr.
ward
glen
mcconnell
not
in
the
sense
that
mr.
fleishman
is
talking
about.
he
was
a
man
doing
his
job.
i
doubt
very
much
if
he
wanted
to
buy
that
book
for
himself
or
if
he’d
like
to
read
it.
mr.
ward
glen
mcconnell
no,
the
seller
assumed
he
was.
that
was
correct,
but
i
don’t
believe
the
record--
mr.
ward
glen
mcconnell
that’s
right.
mr.
ward
glen
mcconnell
that’s
right,
but
just
briefly,
if
i
may,
i
think
that
the
obscenity
of
suite
69
is
clear
from
reading
it
and
the
jury’s
judgment
here
was
based
on
comparable
evidence
which
this
court
had
considered
previously.
it’s
obviously
different
from
other
books.
there
is
no
way
that
the
community
standards
could
not
be
violated
because
nothing
can
go
further.
to
say
the
book
is
not
obscene
is
to
say
that
no
book
without
pictures,
in
other
words
a
written
novel
type
book,
could
be
obscene
and
that
there
are
no
community
standards.
it
would
be
nice
for
mr.
fleishman
and
myself
if
this
court
could
decide
whether
social
importance
is
an
element
that
the
prosecution
has
to
prove
as
part
of
its
case
or
whether
or
not
it’s
just
part
of
the
definition
that’s
stated
in
roth.
it
seems
to
me
that
roth
created
somewhat
of
a
presumption
that
if
the
other
elements
of
obscenity
were
met
and
social
value
is
presumed
not
to
exist,
the
california
court,
the
court
below,
interpreted
that
not
to
be
the
law
and
followed
the
minority
opinion
in
memoirs
in
a
book
versus
attorney
general
as
it
also
followed
the
so-called
pondering
aspects
of
that
book.
i
submit
that
if
this
court
could
say
that
a
book
such
as
fanny
held
might
be
considered
obscene
under
certain
circumstances
of
sale
then,
certainly,
that
book
being
very
tamed
compared
to
suite
69,
certainly
suite
69
and
the
circumstances
under
which
it
was
sold
does
have
to
be
considered
obscene.
i
think
that
there
would--
that
this
really
isn’t
a
question
of
pondering.
the
court
below
did
not
talk
about
ginsberg.
it
talked
about
a
book
versus
attorney
general.
ginsberg
couldn’t
have
been
convicted
under
california
law
because
you
can’t
prove
the
other
elements
of
obscenity
by
the
statements
of
the
seller.
you
can
only
prove
social
value
that
way.
i
think
that
the
opinion
of
the
court
below
shows
they
didn’t
rely
on
the
california
statute,
but
if
this
court
thinks
they
did,
i
would
point
out
that
its
appearance
is,
to
me
at
least,
is
that
of
a
rule
of
evidence
that
codifies
the
law
that
was
set
forth
in
opinions
coming
from
this
court
long
before
petitioner
was
arrested,
and
it
did
become
effective
as
a
statute
in
los
angeles
quite
a
long
time
before
he
was
actually
tried.
it
didn’t
change
any
prior
law.
therefore,
i
would
submit
under
the
facts
of
this
case
that
the
judgment
should
be
affirmed.
thank
you.
