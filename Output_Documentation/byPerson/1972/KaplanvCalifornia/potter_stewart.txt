justice
potter
stewart
but
this--
your
client
wasn’t
convicted
for
reading
something,
was
he?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
the--
your--
stanley
sy
would
seem,
at
least
superficially,
to
uphold
the
right
to
read
but
reidel
on
the
other
point,
on
the
other
hand,
indicate
that
that
does
not
mean
that
your
client
has
the
right
to
sell,
wouldn’t
it?
i
mean,
in
other
words,
your
client
was
not
convicted
for
reading
anything.
justice
potter
stewart
no,
i
think
you
have
to
go
a
little
further
than
to
assert
the
right
to
read,
because
your
client--
justice
potter
stewart
was
not
convicted
for
reading
anything.
justice
potter
stewart
now
when
you
speak
of
variable
obscenity
test,
am
i
right
in
understanding
that
you
mean
just
to
capsulize
the
arguments
you’ve
just
made,
is
that
it?
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
you
say
that
the
record
shows
that
there
were
complaints.
what
were
the
complaints?
justice
potter
stewart
what
were
they
complaining
about,
i
mean.
justice
potter
stewart
is
there
any--
does
the
record
show
that
these
were
being
displayed
to
people
who--
to
passers
by
who--
justice
potter
stewart
well,
the
record
just
doesn’t
who
what
the
complaint
was
about,
does
it?
justice
potter
stewart
to
un--
showing
of
non-willing
people
who
are
offended?
justice
potter
stewart
does
the
record
indicate
what
the
surrounding
environment
was
of
the
store?
was
it
a
place
that
pervades
the
juveniles
and
displayed
to
people
who
weren’t
interested
or
were
offended
by
this?
justice
potter
stewart
no,
i’m
asking
you
a
question.
i’m
driving
at
trying
to
get
an
answer
to
my
question.
justice
potter
stewart
minors
can
enter?
justice
potter
stewart
can’t.
justice
potter
stewart
were
there
displays?
did
he
have
a--
justice
potter
stewart
were
it
on
display?
justice
potter
stewart
do
you
know
where
in
the
record
this
evidence
appears?
if
you
don’t
know,
don’t
take
a
lot
of
time.
justice
potter
stewart
alright,
fine.
justice
potter
stewart
now,
i
suppose
the
compelling
reason
is
that
it’s
a
national
constitution,
isn’t
it?
justice
potter
stewart
and
unless
one
were
to
adopt
the
view
expressed
by,
i
think,
only
two
members
of
this
court
in
modern
times,
mr.
justice
jackson
and
mr.
justice
harlan,
that
the
fourteenth
amendment
does
not
fully
incorporate
the
first
amendment
against
state
action
and,
because
it
is
a
national
constitution,
there’d
have
to
be--
it’s
the
constitution.
that
is
nationwide
that
determines
what
is
speech,
what
is
press.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
that’s
a
pretty
good
one,
isn’t
it?
justice
potter
stewart
and
what
is
protected
by
the
national
or
federal
constitution,
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
which
has
the
same
meaning
in
every
state
unless,
as
i
say,
you
are
pressing
to
us
the
view
taken
by
mr.
justice
jackson
and
mr.
justice
harlan
that
the
fourteenth
amendment
does
not
incorporate
the
first
amendment.
are
you
pressing
that
view?
justice
potter
stewart
it’s
a
very,
very
respectable
view
held
by
two
very
fine
members
of
this
court.
i
think
they’re
the
only
two
in
modern
times.
justice
potter
stewart
so
a
community
to
one
or
two,
in
your
view,
could
convict
a
bookseller
if
that
was
the
community
standard
of--
justice
potter
stewart
of
selling
the
works
of
karl
marx
or
the
writing
or
the
publications
of
the
john
burk
society?
justice
potter
stewart
could
they
if
those
were
the
standards
of
the
community?
justice
potter
stewart
well--
and
where--
the
constitution
would
have
nothing
to
say
if
the
community
decided
that
the
works
of
the
john--
the
publications
of
the
john
burk
society
were
obscene
and
convicted
somebody
for
selling
it?
justice
potter
stewart
but
why
is
that
so
different
and
why
isn’t--
what’s
so
different
about
that
constitutionally?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i’m
not
sure
i
understand
your
argument
and
i’m
trying
to
test
it.
justice
potter
stewart
how
about
the
man
doing
business
in
that
rural
area,
could
he
constitutionally
be
convicted
of
selling
dos
capital?
justice
potter
stewart
does
the
community
think
that’s
offensive
and
obscene,
that
particular
book?
justice
potter
stewart
the
same
rationale
that
limits
a
minor’s
right
to
vote,
for
example.
justice
potter
stewart
but
this--
your
client
wasn’t
convicted
for
reading
something,
was
he?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
the--
your--

you
