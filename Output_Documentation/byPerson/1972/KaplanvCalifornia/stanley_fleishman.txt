mr.
stanley
fleishman
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
petitioner,
murry
kaplan,
a
bookseller,
has
been
branded
by
the
state
of
california
as
a
criminal
for
selling
a
book,
a
sexy
book,
to
an
adult
who
asked
for
a
good
sexy
book.
for
doing
so
mr.
kaplan
has
been
placed
under
probation
for
three
years
on
condition
that
he’d
spend
30
days
in
jail
and
that
he
pay
a
fine
of
$1,000.
initially,
i
would
like
to
point
out
what
is
not
involved
in
this
case.
we
do
not
have,
in
this
case,
any
issue
of
sale
to
or
exhibition
to
minors.
we
do
not
have,
in
this
case,
any
upfront
to
the
sensibilities
of
adults
or
anyone
else.
we
have
no
shock.
we
have
no
fighting
words.
we
have,
to
put
it
simply,
pure
communication,
a
sale
of
a
book
to
an
adult.
the
facts
are
not
in
dispute
at
all.
on
may
14,
1969,
mr.
donald
schidel,
a
police
officer
with
16.5
years
of
experience,
came
to
petitioner’s
bookshop.
it’s
an
adult
bookshop.
there
were
some-250
of
them
in
the
city
of
los
angeles
at
that
time.
mr.
schidel
was
browsing
around
for
about
30
or
40
minutes
when
the
petitioner
said
“this
is
not
a
library.
can
i
help
you?”
it
was
at
that
point
where
mr.
schidel
said
“do
you
have
any
good
sexy
books?”
and
petitioner
said
“all
our
books
are
sexy.”
then
he
said
“i
want
a
good
paperback
book,
something
really
good.”
petitioner
said,
“hey,
i’m
reading
one
now,
suite
69”
and
he
read
him
a
portion
of
pages
84
and
85
which
i
may
say,
parenthetically,
are
pale.
the
words
are
pale
by
comparison
to
henry
miller’s
“topic
of
cancer”
found
not
obscene
by
this
court
a
long
time
ago.
after
reading
the
passages
to
the
officer,
he
parted
for
$1.69--
$1.95,
and
that’s
the
entire
transaction.
now,
from
the
beginning,
the
petitioner
here
urged
that
his
conduct
could
not
be
punished
constitutionally,
that
he
didn’t
do
anything
that
offended
the
state
in
any
fashion
by
selling
this
book
to
this
adult
under
these
circumstances.
our
basic
claim
here,
your
honors,
is
one
that
has,
not
to
my
knowledge,
been
posed
quite
this
way
before
although,
certainly,
we
have
posed
it
differently
on
other
occasions.
our
claim
here
is
that
an
adult
in
america
has
an
absolute
right,
and
i
know
that
absolute
rights
are
not
many
but
i
believe
that
this
is
one
of
the
few
absolute
rights
that
we
have,
an
absolute
right
to
read
anything
he
wants
to
read
even
if
it
has
no
social
value,
even
if
it
appeals
to
the
prurient
interest
of
the
average
person,
and
even
if
it
may
be
thought
to
be
patently
offensive
by
others.
mr.
stanley
fleishman
my
client
asserts
the
right
to
defend
the
right
to
read,
your
honor.
my
client
claims
a
derivative
right.
we
say
that
if
in
fact
an
adult
has
this
absolute
right
to
read,
then
the
bookseller
has
the
right
to
assert
the
right
to
read
in
exactly
the
same
fashion
that
mr.
baird
was
given
standing
to
assert
the
right
of
the
unmarried
woman
who
wanted
to
obtain
a
contraceptive.
we
do
not
claim
that
petitioner
or
bookseller
has
the
right
to
sell
an
obscene
book.
that
fact
is
so.
we
do
say,
however,
that
the
right
to
read
would
be
meaningless
unless
the
bookseller,
when
he
is
charged
criminally,
can
come
before
the
court
and
say
“this,
you
cannot
do
because
you
are
interfering
with
the
right
of
an
adult
to
read
if
you
punish
me,
the
bookseller,
for
selling
to
an
adult.”
mr.
stanley
fleishman
no,
my
client
is--
mr.
stanley
fleishman
i
have--
mr.
stanley
fleishman
your
right,
mr.
justice
stewart.
i
have
thought
further,
i
believe,
in
the
sense
that
i
have
struck
this
case,
at
least
my
argument,
differently
than
we
did
in
reidel.
in
reidel,
we
asserted
the
right
of
mr.
reidel
to
sell.
he
had
the
constitutional
right
to
sell.
i
come
here
now
and
say
i
know
that
mr.
kaplan
does
not
have
a
constitutional
right
to
sell
an
obscene
book,
but
i
do
say
that
the
book
seller
has
standing
to
assert
the
right
of
the
reader.
there
is
nothing
in
reidel
at
all
that
is
in
conflict
with
that.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
i
believe
that
on
a
close
reading,
justice
white,
of
reidel,
you
told
us
that
we
didn’t
pose
it
at
our
argument
correctly.
as
i
read
it,
you
did
state
that
there
was
an
independent
right
there,
but
we
haven’t
claimed
the
correct
right
in
reidel.
at
least
that’s
my
reading
of
it.
i
do
not
believe
there
is
anything
in
reidel
that
stands
in
the
way
of
our
prevailing
in
this
case
at
all.
the
result
may
be
very
close
to
the
same,
but
we
certainly
are
walking
in
a
different
door
and
that
is
what
i
am
talking
about
at
this
time.
i
don’t
think
there
is
any
way
of
avoiding
the
result
that
we
claim
here
once
we
agree
as
to
a
proposition
that
there
can
be
no
disagreement
about
it,
and
that
is
that
an
adult
simply
has
this
absolute
right
to
read.
it’s
not
only
in
our
constitution.
it’s
not
only
in
the
cases
that
this
court
has
decided
on
enumerable
occasions
but
it
is,
if
you
will,
in
the
universal
declaration
of
human
rights
which
has
been
with
us
now
for
some-25
years,
passed
in
1948.
article
xix
of
that
universal
declaration
of
human
rights
states
that
everyone
has
the
right
to
freedom
of
opinion
and
expression.
this
right
includes
freedom
to
uphold
opinions
without
interference
and
to
seek,
receive
information
and
ideas
through
any
medium.
now--
mr.
stanley
fleishman
it
says
really
“through
any
medium”
which
is
through
books,
magazines,
or
through
any
communication
as
i
would
see
it,
your
honor.
mr.
stanley
fleishman
it
does
not
violate
california
statute,
mr.
chief
justice,
because--
mr.
stanley
fleishman
this--
it
would
violate
the
statute
if
the
statute
would
give
in
the
broad
reach
that
the
state
has
claimed
for
it.
what
we
say
here,
though,
is
that
that
broad
reach
is
simply
impermissible
because
it
does
not
trench
upon
any
state
interest.
the
only
state
interest
that
have
ever
been
articulated
by
this
court
with
regard
to
the
suppression
of
obscenity
are
really
two-fold.
one
is
the
legitimate
concern
with
minors,
and
the
other
is
the
legitimate
with
concern
with
the
privacy
of
the
general
public
so
that
the
general
public
is
not
shocked
or
affronted
by
obscenity
because
it
is
the
fact
that
this
kind
of
communication
of
very
explicit
sexual
material
can
cause
shock
in
very
much
the
same
way
as
the
words
in
chaplinsky
were
thought
to
be
fighting
words,
or
in
very
much
the
same
way
that
the
words
in
boe
harneigh
were
thought
to
be
offensive
to
the
sensitivities
of
the
persons
who
heard
them
but,
once
we
leave
that,
there
simply
is
no
state
interest
in
telling
a
person
that
he
cannot
read
an
obscene
book.
that’s
my
understanding
of
what
your
honor
said
in
reidel,
mr.
justice
white,
where,
as
i
read
it,
there
was
the
statement
that
stanley
recognized
an
independent
constitutional
right,
independent
of
the
first
amendment,
a
constitutional
right
to
read
what
one
wanted,
whether
one
talks
of
this
in
terms
of
the
numbers
that
come
from
the
first,
the
fourth,
and
the
ninth,
or
however
one
wants
to
articulate
it.
we
do
state
that
the
california
just
simple
does
not
have
constitutional
power
to
interfere
as
far
as
it
has
in
this
case.
mr.
stanley
fleishman
well--
because,
your
honor,
and
this
really
is
the
heart
of
my
argument
that
even
though
obscenity
is
not
speech
and,
therefore,
is
not
protected
by
the
first
and
fourteenth
amendments,
even
so,
an
adult
has
the
right
to
read
obscenity
and
this
right
to
read,
even
obscenity,
is
a
fundamental
personal
right.
therefore,
if
the
state
wants
to
interfere
with
the
fundamental
personal
right
to
read
even
an
obscene
book,
then
the
state
must
show
a
compelling
reason.
mr.
stanley
fleishman
not
entirely.
i
think
that’s
what
mr.
justice
white
was
teaching,
me
at
least,
in
reidel,
that
there
is
a
right
to
read
but
it
is
not
a
first
amendment
right
to
read
and,
therefore,
it’s
an
independently
safe
right.
there
are
certain
things,
for
example,
i
suppose
i
have
the
right,
a
fundamental
constitutional
right,
to
go
out
and
enjoy
a
sunset,
to
enjoy
that.
that’s
a
fundamental
right
that
i
have.
now,
that’s
not
a
first
amendment
right.
it’s
a
personal
right
that
comes
to
me
as
a
human
being
in
terms
of
the
importance
of
liberty,
and
the
state
simply
cannot
interfere
with
that
right
without
showing
some
legitimate
state
interest,
an
the
legitimate
state
interest
must
be
a
compelling
interest
where
you
have
fundamental
rights
at
stake.
that--
mr.
stanley
fleishman
no.
mr.
stanley
fleishman
no.
mr.
stanley
fleishman
no,
and
i
think
this
is
the
distinction
that
was
drawn
in
griswold.
it’s
a
distinction
that
was
drawn
in
baird.
it’s
the
distinction
that
is
present
in
stanley
and
it’s
the
distinction
that
we
claim
here,
that
there
are
personal
fundamental
rights
that
simply
stand
on
a
higher
footing
than
merely
economic
rights
or
social
rights
which
do
not
come
on
into
this
same
level.
when
you
said
in
griswold
that
there
is
a
right
of
privacy,
marital
privacy,
which
is
fundamental
and
the
state
can
only
intrude
in
that
in
limited
area
and
upon
the
showing
of
a
compelling
interest,
it
was
because
there
was
a
finding
that
that
situation
was
of
great
importance
in
a
free
society,
and
i’m
saying
the
right
to
think
and
all
that’s
embodied
in
that
is
fundamental
to
a
free
society.
you
cannot--
you
simply
cannot
have
a
democratic
society
without
giving
and
recognizing
the
importance
of
the
right
to
read
anything
that
an
adult
wants
to
read.
now,
once
that
we
agree
that
that
is
a
fundamental
personal
right
which
is
on
a
different
footing
than
the
land
case
that
your
honor
was
talking
about,
then
i
say
that
the
state
has
to
come
in
and
show
something.
why,
for
what
reason,
can
the
state
come
in
and
say
that
an
adult
cannot
exercise
that
right,
and
they
simply
have
not
done
it
here.
their
attempts
to
justify
it
not
only
don’t
make
a
compelling
case,
they
don’t
even
make
a
rational
case.
the
only--
mr.
stanley
fleishman
we
are
dealing
with
the
right
of
petitioner
to
assert
the
right
of
the
reader
in
precisely
the
same
way,
your
honor,
that
mr.
baird
was
given
standing
to
assert
the
right
of
the
unmarried
woman
who
wanted
to
obtain
a
contraceptive.
now,
in
that
case,
the
right
belonged
to
the
unmarried
woman,
but
the
person
who
asserted
the
right
was
mr.
baird
who
had
given
it
to
her.
now,
in
this
case,
the
right
that
i
claim,
the
constitutional
right
that
is
inherent
here
in
this
case
is
the
adult
person’s
right
to
read.
but,
the
bookseller,
the
person
who
makes
that
right
meaningful
is
in
a
position
to
assert
that
right.
he
has
standing.
he
has
standing
for
better
reasons
than
baird
was
given
standing
in
the
baird
case
because,
in
baird,
the
court
said
unless
mr.
baird
could
assert
the
right
that
was
involved,
the
right
would
fall
into
this
too.
it
would
wither
away.
now,
in
our
case
in
california
there
is
no
crime
of
reading
an
obscene
book.
therefore,
there
would
never
be
a
situation
where
the
adult
could
assert.
he
would
have
no
form
in
which
to
assert
his
right
and,
under
those
circumstances,
this
court
has
said
that
you—the
third
party
rule,
the
rule
of
asserting
third
party
rights
can
be
relaxed
and
should
be
relaxed,
and
that
is
exactly
what
we
are
here.
we
do
not
say,
and
i
want
to
repeat
it,
we
do
not
say
that
the
bookseller
has
an
independent
right
to
distribute
an
obscene
book.
roth
has
said
no,
reidel
has
said
no,
and
we
accept
those
propositions
here,
but
that
does
not
mean
that
a
bookseller
can
be
sent
to
jail
for
doing
nothing
more
than
engaging
in
a
transaction
which
is
absolutely
protected,
that
is
to
say
letting
an
adult
obtain
a
book
which
he
has
an
absolute
right
to
read.
that--
mr.
stanley
fleishman
that
is,
on
this
aspect
of
the
case,
that
is
true.
i
would--
before
leaving
this,
if
the
court
please,
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
as
i
understand
it,
every
member
of
the
court
really
has
accepted
the
right
of
the
adult
to
read
obscenity
privately.
if
i
understand
rosenfelt
correctly,
mr.
justice
powell
there
stated
that
our
free
society
had
to
be
flexible
enough
to
permit
adults
to
engage
their
tastes
which
would
include
obscene
talk
privately,
but
the
condition
was
that
that
obscene
talk
not
be
such
as
to
intrude
upon
those
who
are
unwilling
to
engage
in
this
kind
of
talk.
inherent
in
and
explicitly
stated
in
rosenfelt
was
that
there
was
the
right
of
an
individual
to
exercise
their
own
taste
in
this
way.
it’s
something
we
all
know,
this
distinction
between
the
public
and
the
private,
a
joke
which
is
perfectly
proper.
it
may
be
an
obscene
joke,
perfectly
proper
in
a
fraternity
house
or
in
a
locker
room
is
perfectly
improper
when
its
either
public
or
perhaps
in
this
quadroon
because
it
becomes
an
offense,
but
if
you
had
the
situation
which
we
have
in
this
case,
whether
it
simply
is
no
offense
to
anyone,
then
so
far
as
this
aspect
of
the
case
is
concerned
there
is
the
absolute
right
to
read
which
then
does
depend
on
standing
as
your
honor
did
state
before.
but,
there
are
other
aspects
to
the
case
which
do
not
depend
on
standing.
first
of
all,
once
we
leave
the
first
point,
we
believe
that
the
book
is
not
obscene
under
the
variable
obscenity
test
even
if
it
meets
the
three-pronged
tests
set
forth
by
this
court
in
memoires.
that
is
to
say
a
book
which
is
sold
to
a
consenting
adult
under
controlled
circumstances,
such
as
we
have
here,
simply
is
not
patently
offensive
because
it’s
one
thing
if
you
have
a
mass
mailing,
such
as
was
involved
in
roth
in
the
first
instance
or
again
in
ginsberg.
there,
because
it
goes
out
indiscriminately,
it’s
going
to
be
offensive
to
large
numbers
of
persons,
and
then
you
do
have
to
ask
the
question
“is
it
patently
offensive
to
this
large
group
of
people
who
are
exposed
to
it?”
but
it’s
irrelevant,
it
seems
to
me,
when
you
have
a
situation
where
if
i
choose
to
buy
the
book
and
read
the
book
and
it
doesn’t
offend
me,
then
it
doesn’t
matter
that
that
same
book
would
offend
most
other
people.
the
other
people
don’t
buy
it,
don’t
read
it
and,
therefore,
whether
it
does
or
does
not
offend
them
is
simply
irrelevant.
the
same
thing
is
true
with
regard
to
the
appeal
to
the
current
interest.
now,
the
appeal
to
the
prurient
interest
of
the
average
person
makes
sense
when
you
have,
again,
a
widespread
distribution
to
a
large
number
of
persons
so
you
have
to
then
strike
the
group
that
is
concerned.
but,
when
you
have
a
private
transaction
such
as
you
have
here,
it
simply
doesn’t
matter
that
it
may
appeal
to
the
prurient
interest
of
the
average
person
if
it
does
not
appeal
to
the
prurient
interest
of
the
person
who
reads
it.
this
is
only
the
other
side
really
of
mishkin.
in
mishkin,
your
honor
stated
that
it
was
proper
to
adjust
the
test
depending
upon
the
audience
for
whom
it
is
prepared
and
the
primarily
distributed
to
and,
there,
material
which
would
have
been
perhaps
not
obscene
if
it
was
to
the
average
person
was
found
to
be
obscene
because
it
was
geared
for
a
particular
group
where
we’d
have
a
particular
impact.
now,
i’m
looking
at
the
other
side
of
that
coin.
if
all
we
have
are
consenting
adults,
people
who
are
not
offended,
people
who
do
not
have
their
prurient
interest
appealed
to
by
the
reading
of
this,
people
for
whom
it
does
have
value
even
if
it
would
not
have
value
generally,
then
that
book
to
that
person
under
those
circumstances
simply
is
not
obscene.
for
that
argument,
mr.
justice
blackmun,
of
course,
we
do
not
require
to
go
on
a
standing.
that’s
an
independent
right
because
the
bookseller
has
an
independent
right
to
sell
the
book
now
because,
on
this
argument,
the
book
is
not
obscene
under
a
variable
obscenity
test,
and--
mr.
stanley
fleishman
yes,
your
honor.
that
is
it
talks
in
terms
of
the
audience
and
the
context.
mr.
stanley
fleishman
exactly.
the
third
part
of
the
argument,
insofar
as
this
is
concerned,
is
that
aside
from
everything
else,
if
we
forget
the
variable
obscenity
test,
if
we
forget
the
right
o
read,
this
book
is
simply
not
obscene
under
cases
already
decided
by
this
court.
the
book,
after
all,
is
words
alone.
it
has
no
pictures.
in
terms
of
the
words
used,
they
surely
are
no
stronger,
no
starker
than
the
words
that
are
henry
miller’s
book
and
in
noise
complaint
and
all
around
us,
as
far
as
that’s
concerned,
and
in
terms
of
the
descriptions
that
are
there.
there
comes
a
time,
i
would
respectfully
submit,
that
there’s
nothing
new
that
you
can
say
about
the
subject,
and
that
time
has
simply
come
and
gone.
so
that,
in
every
aspect
of
the
case,
the
book,
it
seems
to
me,
cannot
be
the
basis
of
a
criminal
conviction
such
as
was
involved
here.
if
the
court
please,
i’d
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
stanley
fleishman
yes,
sir,
i
would.
i
think
that
stand
on
exactly
the
same
footing,
the
right
to
get
information
whether
one
gets
it
by
words
or
by
picture
stands
on
the
same
point,
mr.
justice
powell,
in
my
opinion.
i
think
that
the
colloquy
that
justice
marshall
had
with
mr.
mcconnell
points
the
direction,
as
i
see
it,
to
the
solution
in
the
case.
mr.
mcconnell
said
that
as
he
walked
down
washington
somebody
tried
to
hustle
him
into
a
bookstore
and
there
was
no
such
similar
hustling
that
appeared
in
the
case
at
bar.
there’s
nothing
in
the
record
at
all
along
those
lines.
what
we
have
suggested
on
our
papers,
and
i
think
it
is
wise
and
i
think
it
follows
the
opinions
mostly
of
you,
mr.
justice
white,
as
i
understand
them
and,
that
is,
that
a
statute
can
be
good
or
bad
depending
upon
the
record
that
it’s
made.
that
is
my
understanding
of
baird
that,
in
that
case,
it
wasn’t
the
statute
that
your
honor
was
focusing
on
so
much
as
proof
in
the
case.
since
the
state
was
claiming
that
there
was
a
health
hazard,
then
your
honor
quite
properly
said
whether
there
is
any
record
that
this
phone
was
relevant
to
the
health
hazard.
now,
there
are
again
only
two
things
that
the
state
talked
about
in
this
case
or
any
obscenity
cases.
mr.
mcconnell
talks
about
minors
and
he
talks
about
an
obtrusive
kind
of
distribution.
now,
minors
simply
cannot
be
the
basis
of
the
conviction.
it
is
true--
i
suppose
it’s
true
that
if
there
are
books
that
are
on
the
market
generally,
that
some
of
these
books
will
ultimately
find
their
way
to
minors
in
the
same
way
that
if
you
have
automobiles
on
the
road,
i
suppose
that
minors
are
from
time
to
time
going
to
drive
those
automobiles.
and,
in
the
same
way,
if
you
have
cigarettes
being
sold,
that
minors
are
going
to
smoke
cigarettes.
but,
butler
told
us
it
was
reinforced
in
roth
and
it
has
been
restated
every
opportunity
this
court
has
had
an
opportunity
to
talk
about
the
subject,
that
you
cannot
limit
what
adults
are
going
to
read
because
we
are
saying
that
it’s
inappropriate
for
minors.
so
that,
in
this
case,
for
mr.
mcconnell
to
argue
that
to
follow
the
argument
that
we
have
suggested
would
mean
that
there
is
a
greater
likelihood
that
minors
will
get
books
simply
does
not
meet
the
constitutional
issue.
mr.
stanley
fleishman
the
court
has
so
held
in
ginsberg
against
first--
against
new
york
and
we
do
not--
mr.
stanley
fleishman
not
quite.
as
i
read
justice
brennan’s
opinion,
it
was
there
stated
that
the
right
of
a
minor
to
read
did
not
stand
as--
on
as
high
a
footing
as
the
right
of
an
adult
and,
therefore,
since
it
wasn’t
on
the
same
footing
that
the
right
of
the
minor
could
be
interfered
with
by
showing
of
rationality.
now,
it’s
true
that
that
was
a
bookseller
who
was
convicted,
but
the
court
did
talk
about
the
right
of
a
minor
in
that
situation
and
he
didn’t
have--
the
minor
did
not
have
the
same
right.
it’s
what
i
understand
mr.
justice
stewart
was
saying
in
that
opinion.
he
is
saying
it’s
one
thing
to
say
that
the
constitution
protects
absolutely
the
right
of
an
adult
to
read
because
he
is
a
thinking
person,
but
that
a
minor
on
a
theory
that
he
doesn’t
have
the
thinking
processes
yet,
it’s
kind
of
like
an
involuntary
thrusting
upon
a
person
who
is
not
full--
full
thrust--
mr.
stanley
fleishman
exactly,
so
that
my
argument
does
not,
in
any
way,
touch
the
ginsberg’s--
ginsberg
against
new
york
argument,
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
mr.
stanley
fleishman
that
is
correct,
your
honor,
but
this
court,
on
a
number
of
occasions,
has
already
taken
the
step
in
terms
of
saying
that
the
right
of
a
minor
is
not
as
great
as
the
right
of
adult.
your
honors
did
that,
of
course,
in
the
prince
case
in
the
beginning,
came
back
again
in
ginsberg,
and.
it
came
up
in
a
fashion,
i
suppose,
in
the
case--
the
yoder
case,
wisconsin
versus
yoder.
mr.
stanley
fleishman
there
is
certainly
some
latitude.
i
don’t
think
that
i
would
accept
20.
since
a
person
could
vote
at
18,
i
think
that
whenever
you
go
above
18
you’re
going
to
get
into
a
question
of
rationality
but,
certainly,
the
state
does
have
the
right
to
have
a
different
test
for
minors
and,
i
might
add
that,
in
california,
we
do
have
a
minor’s
statute.
in
california,
if
in
fact
there
was
a
sale
to
minors,
there
is
a
specific
statute
which
would
control
that
situation.
now,
the
other
aspect
of
the
case
that
mr.
mcconnell
rise--
raises
is,
one,
is
i
say
is
minors
and
that
certainly
won’t
do
it
and
the
other
is
that
if
you
have
a
rule
such
as
we’re
arguing
for
that
they
may
be,
it
may
end
up
in,
an
obtrusive
thrusting
upon
an
unwilling
audience.
the
simple
answer
to
that
is,
when
that
time
comes,
the
state
of
california
is
absolutely
free
to
charge
a
person,
put
on
proof
of
that,
and
to
convict
him
for
thrusting
it
upon
an
unwilling
audience.
we
do
not
ask,
in
this
case,
that
the
statute
be
touched
at
all.
all
we
say
is
and
all
we
argue
for
is
that
the
state
has
simply
gone
too
far.
it
has
infringed
upon
a
constitutional
right
when
it
has
punished
mr.
kaplan
for
doing
no
more
than
selling
the
book
under
these
circumstances.
now,
there
is
one
or
two
other
things
that
i
would
like
to
touch
on
if
i
may
in
the
brief
time
still
remaining.
mr.
mcconnell
says,
of
course,
griswold
and
baird
stand
on
the
high
ground
that
the
discussion
about
birth
control
is
very
important,
very
fundamental,
and
of
course
the
state
cannot
interfere
with
that.
and
then
he
says
in
a
way
that
i
don’t
quite
understand
that
sex
somehow
is
not
important.
people
somehow
are
not
interested
in
sex,
as
i
hear
mr.
mcconnell’s
argument.
the
simple
fact
is
that
people
are
enormously
interested
in
the
subject.
if
there’s
one
thing
that
we
know,
it
is
that
the
people
buy
books
dealing
with
sex,
very
explicit
books.
they
look
at
films
of
this
kind
and
they
derive
a
great
deal
of
value
from
it.
the
commission
of
upsetting
pornography
spent
some-two
years
engaged
in
an
enormous
amount
of
original
research.
it
engaged
in
a
great
deal
of
scientific
survey
taking
in
terms
of
whom
reads
sexy
books,
why
do
they
read
them,
what
do
they
get
out
of
them,
and
they
have
concluded
that
the
people
who
read
them,
for
the
most
part,
are
middle-aged,
middle-class,
white
people
who
read
them
and
derive
a
great
deal
of
pleasure,
information,
and
satisfactions
from
reading
this.
now,
it
therefore
seems
to
me
to
be
inappropriate
and
wrong
to
make
an
argument
that
griswold
and
baird
will
correctly
decided
it
because
the
discussion
was
about
contraceptives
and
how
to
get--
whether
or
not
one
would
have
children
but,
at
the
same
time,
that
a
book
or
magazine
which
deals
with
sex,
explicit
sexual
material
is
somehow
without
social
value.
it’s
not
the
fact,
and
i
believe
that
the
commission
studies
and
our
whole
history
has
taught
us
that
there
is,
in
fact,
value
in
books
such
as
suite
69
even
if
the
values
do
not
seem
to
include
all
of
us.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
stanley
fleishman
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
petitioner,
murry
kaplan,
a
bookseller,
has
been
branded
by
the
state
of
california
as
a
criminal
for
selling
a
book,
a
sexy
book,
to
an
adult
who
asked
for
a
good
sexy
book.
for
doing
so
mr.
kaplan
has
been
placed
under
probation
for
three
years
on
condition
that
he’d
spend
30
days
in
jail
and
that
he
pay
a
fine
of
$1,000.
initially,
i
would
like
to
point
out
what
is
not
involved
in
this
case.
we
do
not
have,
in
this
case,
any
issue
of
sale
to
or
exhibition
to
minors.
we
do
not
have,
in
this
case,
any
upfront
to
the
sensibilities
of
adults
or
anyone
else.
we
have
no
shock.
we
have
no
fighting
words.
we
have,
to
put
it
simply,
pure
communication,
a
sale
of
a
book
to
an
adult.
the
facts
are
not
in
dispute
at
all.
on
may
14,
1969,
mr.
donald
schidel,
a
police
officer
with
16.5
years
of
experience,
came
to
petitioner’s
bookshop.
it’s
an
adult
bookshop.
there
were
some-250
of
them
in
the
city
of
los
angeles
at
that
time.
mr.
schidel
was
browsing
around
for
about
30
or
40
minutes
when
the
petitioner
said
“this
is
not
a
library.
can
i
help
you?”
it
was
at
that
point
where
mr.
schidel
said
“do
you
have
any
good
sexy
books?”
and
petitioner
said
“all
our
books
are
sexy.”
then
he
said
“i
want
a
good
paperback
book,
something
really
good.”
petitioner
said,
“hey,
i’m
reading
one
now,
suite
69”
and
he
read
him
a
portion
of
pages
84
and
85
which
i
may
say,
parenthetically,
are
pale.
the
words
are
pale
by
comparison
to
henry
miller’s
“topic
of
cancer”
found
not
obscene
by
this
court
a
long
time
ago.
after
reading
the
passages
to
the
officer,
he
parted
for
$1.69--
$1.95,
and
that’s
the
entire
transaction.
now,
from
the
beginning,
the
petitioner
here
urged
that
his
conduct
could
not
be
punished
constitutionally,
that
he
didn’t
do
anything
that
offended
the
state
in
any
fashion
by
selling
this
book
to
this
adult
under
these
circumstances.
our
basic
claim
here,
your
honors,
is
one
that
has,
not
to
my
knowledge,
been
posed
quite
this
way
before
although,
certainly,
we
have
posed
it
differently
on
other
occasions.
our
claim
here
is
that
an
adult
in
america
has
an
absolute
right,
and
i
know
that
absolute
rights
are
not
many
but
i
believe
that
this
is
one
of
the
few
absolute
rights
that
we
have,
an
absolute
right
to
read
anything
he
wants
to
read
even
if
it
has
no
social
value,
even
if
it
appeals
to
the
prurient
interest
of
the
average
person,
and
even
if
it
may
be
thought
to
be
patently
offensive
by
others.
mr.
stanley
fleishman
my
client
asserts
the
right
to
defend
the
right
to
read,
your
honor.
my
client
claims
a
derivative
right.
we
say
that
if
in
fact
an
adult
has
this
absolute
right
to
read,
then
the
bookseller
has
the
right
to
assert
the
right
to
read
in
exactly
the
same
fashion
that
mr.
baird
was
given
standing
to
assert
the
right
of
the
unmarried
woman
who
wanted
to
obtain
a
contraceptive.
we
do
not
claim
that
petitioner
or
bookseller
has
the
right
to
sell
an
obscene
book.
that
fact
is
so.
we
do
say,
however,
that
the
right
to
read
would
be
meaningless
unless
the
bookseller,
when
he
is
charged
criminally,
can
come
before
the
court
and
say
“this,
you
cannot
do
because
you
are
interfering
with
the
right
of
an
adult
to
read
if
you
punish
me,
the
bookseller,
for
selling
to
an
adult.”
mr.
stanley
fleishman
no,
my
client
is--
mr.
stanley
fleishman
i
have--
mr.
stanley
fleishman
your
right,
mr.
justice
stewart.
i
have
thought
further,
i
believe,
in
the
sense
that
i
have
struck
this
case,
at
least
my
argument,
differently
than
we
did
in
reidel.
in
reidel,
we
asserted
the
right
of
mr.
reidel
to
sell.
he
had
the
constitutional
right
to
sell.
i
come
here
now
and
say
i
know
that
mr.
kaplan
does
not
have
a
constitutional
right
to
sell
an
obscene
book,
but
i
do
say
that
the
book
seller
has
standing
to
assert
the
right
of
the
reader.
there
is
nothing
in
reidel
at
all
that
is
in
conflict
with
that.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
i
believe
that
on
a
close
reading,
justice
white,
of
reidel,
you
told
us
that
we
didn’t
pose
it
at
our
argument
correctly.
as
i
read
it,
you
did
state
that
there
was
an
independent
right
there,
but
we
haven’t
claimed
the
correct
right
in
reidel.
at
least
that’s
my
reading
of
it.
i
do
not
believe
there
is
anything
in
reidel
that
stands
in
the
way
of
our
prevailing
in
this
case
at
all.
the
result
may
be
very
close
to
the
same,
but
we
certainly
are
walking
in
a
different
door
and
that
is
what
i
am
talking
about
at
this
time.
i
don’t
think
there
is
any
way
of
avoiding
the
result
that
we
claim
here
once
we
agree
as
to
a
proposition
that
there
can
be
no
disagreement
about
it,
and
that
is
that
an
adult
simply
has
this
absolute
right
to
read.
it’s
not
only
in
our
constitution.
it’s
not
only
in
the
cases
that
this
court
has
decided
on
enumerable
occasions
but
it
is,
if
you
will,
in
the
universal
declaration
of
human
rights
which
has
been
with
us
now
for
some-25
years,
passed
in
1948.
article
xix
of
that
universal
declaration
of
human
rights
states
that
everyone
has
the
right
to
freedom
of
opinion
and
expression.
this
right
includes
freedom
to
uphold
opinions
without
interference
and
to
seek,
receive
information
and
ideas
through
any
medium.
now--
mr.
stanley
fleishman
it
says
really
“through
any
medium”
which
is
through
books,
magazines,
or
through
any
communication
as
i
would
see
it,
your
honor.
mr.
stanley
fleishman
it
does
not
violate
california
statute,
mr.
chief
justice,
because--
mr.
stanley
fleishman
this--
it
would
violate
the
statute
if
the
statute
would
give
in
the
broad
reach
that
the
state
has
claimed
for
it.
what
we
say
here,
though,
is
that
that
broad
reach
is
simply
impermissible
because
it
does
not
trench
upon
any
state
interest.
the
only
state
interest
that
have
ever
been
articulated
by
this
court
with
regard
to
the
suppression
of
obscenity
are
really
two-fold.
one
is
the
legitimate
concern
with
minors,
and
the
other
is
the
legitimate
with
concern
with
the
privacy
of
the
general
public
so
that
the
general
public
is
not
shocked
or
affronted
by
obscenity
because
it
is
the
fact
that
this
kind
of
communication
of
very
explicit
sexual
material
can
cause
shock
in
very
much
the
same
way
as
the
words
in
chaplinsky
were
thought
to
be
fighting
words,
or
in
very
much
the
same
way
that
the
words
in
boe
harneigh
were
thought
to
be
offensive
to
the
sensitivities
of
the
persons
who
heard
them
but,
once
we
leave
that,
there
simply
is
no
state
interest
in
telling
a
person
that
he
cannot
read
an
obscene
book.
that’s
my
understanding
of
what
your
honor
said
in
reidel,
mr.
justice
white,
where,
as
i
read
it,
there
was
the
statement
that
stanley
recognized
an
independent
constitutional
right,
independent
of
the
first
amendment,
a
constitutional
right
to
read
what
one
wanted,
whether
one
talks
of
this
in
terms
of
the
numbers
that
come
from
the
first,
the
fourth,
and
the
ninth,
or
however
one
wants
to
articulate
it.
we
do
state
that
the
california
just
simple
does
not
have
constitutional
power
to
interfere
as
far
as
it
has
in
this
case.
mr.
stanley
fleishman
well--
because,
your
honor,
and
this
really
is
the
heart
of
my
argument
that
even
though
obscenity
is
not
speech
and,
therefore,
is
not
protected
by
the
first
and
fourteenth
amendments,
even
so,
an
adult
has
the
right
to
read
obscenity
and
this
right
to
read,
even
obscenity,
is
a
fundamental
personal
right.
therefore,
if
the
state
wants
to
interfere
with
the
fundamental
personal
right
to
read
even
an
obscene
book,
then
the
state
must
show
a
compelling
reason.
mr.
stanley
fleishman
not
entirely.
i
think
that’s
what
mr.
justice
white
was
teaching,
me
at
least,
in
reidel,
that
there
is
a
right
to
read
but
it
is
not
a
first
amendment
right
to
read
and,
therefore,
it’s
an
independently
safe
right.
there
are
certain
things,
for
example,
i
suppose
i
have
the
right,
a
fundamental
constitutional
right,
to
go
out
and
enjoy
a
sunset,
to
enjoy
that.
that’s
a
fundamental
right
that
i
have.
now,
that’s
not
a
first
amendment
right.
it’s
a
personal
right
that
comes
to
me
as
a
human
being
in
terms
of
the
importance
of
liberty,
and
the
state
simply
cannot
interfere
with
that
right
without
showing
some
legitimate
state
interest,
an
the
legitimate
state
interest
must
be
a
compelling
interest
where
you
have
fundamental
rights
at
stake.
that--
mr.
stanley
fleishman
no.
mr.
stanley
fleishman
no.
mr.
stanley
fleishman
no,
and
i
think
this
is
the
distinction
that
was
drawn
in
griswold.
it’s
a
distinction
that
was
drawn
in
baird.
it’s
the
distinction
that
is
present
in
stanley
and
it’s
the
distinction
that
we
claim
here,
that
there
are
personal
fundamental
rights
that
simply
stand
on
a
higher
footing
than
merely
economic
rights
or
social
rights
which
do
not
come
on
into
this
same
level.
when
you
said
in
griswold
that
there
is
a
right
of
privacy,
marital
privacy,
which
is
fundamental
and
the
state
can
only
intrude
in
that
in
limited
area
and
upon
the
showing
of
a
compelling
interest,
it
was
because
there
was
a
finding
that
that
situation
was
of
great
importance
in
a
free
society,
and
i’m
saying
the
right
to
think
and
all
that’s
embodied
in
that
is
fundamental
to
a
free
society.
you
cannot--
you
simply
cannot
have
a
democratic
society
without
giving
and
recognizing
the
importance
of
the
right
to
read
anything
that
an
adult
wants
to
read.
now,
once
that
we
agree
that
that
is
a
fundamental
personal
right
which
is
on
a
different
footing
than
the
land
case
that
your
honor
was
talking
about,
then
i
say
that
the
state
has
to
come
in
and
show
something.
why,
for
what
reason,
can
the
state
come
in
and
say
that
an
adult
cannot
exercise
that
right,
and
they
simply
have
not
done
it
here.
their
attempts
to
justify
it
not
only
don’t
make
a
compelling
case,
they
don’t
even
make
a
rational
case.
the
only--
mr.
stanley
fleishman
we
are
dealing
with
the
right
of
petitioner
to
assert
the
right
of
the
reader
in
precisely
the
same
way,
your
honor,
that
mr.
baird
was
given
standing
to
assert
the
right
of
the
unmarried
woman
who
wanted
to
obtain
a
contraceptive.
now,
in
that
case,
the
right
belonged
to
the
unmarried
woman,
but
the
person
who
asserted
the
right
was
mr.
baird
who
had
given
it
to
her.
now,
in
this
case,
the
right
that
i
claim,
the
constitutional
right
that
is
inherent
here
in
this
case
is
the
adult
person’s
right
to
read.
but,
the
bookseller,
the
person
who
makes
that
right
meaningful
is
in
a
position
to
assert
that
right.
he
has
standing.
he
has
standing
for
better
reasons
than
baird
was
given
standing
in
the
baird
case
because,
in
baird,
the
court
said
unless
mr.
baird
could
assert
the
right
that
was
involved,
the
right
would
fall
into
this
too.
it
would
wither
away.
now,
in
our
case
in
california
there
is
no
crime
of
reading
an
obscene
book.
therefore,
there
would
never
be
a
situation
where
the
adult
could
assert.
he
would
have
no
form
in
which
to
assert
his
right
and,
under
those
circumstances,
this
court
has
said
that
you—the
third
party
rule,
the
rule
of
asserting
third
party
rights
can
be
relaxed
and
should
be
relaxed,
and
that
is
exactly
what
we
are
here.
we
do
not
say,
and
i
want
to
repeat
it,
we
do
not
say
that
the
bookseller
has
an
independent
right
to
distribute
an
obscene
book.
roth
has
said
no,
reidel
has
said
no,
and
we
accept
those
propositions
here,
but
that
does
not
mean
that
a
bookseller
can
be
sent
to
jail
for
doing
nothing
more
than
engaging
in
a
transaction
which
is
absolutely
protected,
that
is
to
say
letting
an
adult
obtain
a
book
which
he
has
an
absolute
right
to
read.
that--
mr.
stanley
fleishman
that
is,
on
this
aspect
of
the
case,
that
is
true.
i
would--
before
leaving
this,
if
the
court
please,
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
as
i
understand
it,
every
member
of
the
court
really
has
accepted
the
right
of
the
adult
to
read
obscenity
privately.
if
i
understand
rosenfelt
correctly,
mr.
justice
powell
there
stated
that
our
free
society
had
to
be
flexible
enough
to
permit
adults
to
engage
their
tastes
which
would
include
obscene
talk
privately,
but
the
condition
was
that
that
obscene
talk
not
be
such
as
to
intrude
upon
those
who
are
unwilling
to
engage
in
this
kind
of
talk.
inherent
in
and
explicitly
stated
in
rosenfelt
was
that
there
was
the
right
of
an
individual
to
exercise
their
own
taste
in
this
way.
it’s
something
we
all
know,
this
distinction
between
the
public
and
the
private,
a
joke
which
is
perfectly
proper.
it
may
be
an
obscene
joke,
perfectly
proper
in
a
fraternity
house
or
in
a
locker
room
is
perfectly
improper
when
its
either
public
or
perhaps
in
this
quadroon
because
it
becomes
an
offense,
but
if
you
had
the
situation
which
we
have
in
this
case,
whether
it
simply
is
no
offense
to
anyone,
then
so
far
as
this
aspect
of
the
case
is
concerned
there
is
the
absolute
right
to
read
which
then
does
depend
on
standing
as
your
honor
did
state
before.
but,
there
are
other
aspects
to
the
case
which
do
not
depend
on
standing.
first
of
all,
once
we
leave
the
first
point,
we
believe
that
the
book
is
not
obscene
under
the
variable
obscenity
test
even
if
it
meets
the
three-pronged
tests
set
forth
by
this
court
in
memoires.
that
is
to
say
a
book
which
is
sold
to
a
consenting
adult
under
controlled
circumstances,
such
as
we
have
here,
simply
is
not
patently
offensive
because
it’s
one
thing
if
you
have
a
mass
mailing,
such
as
was
involved
in
roth
in
the
first
instance
or
again
in
ginsberg.
there,
because
it
goes
out
indiscriminately,
it’s
going
to
be
offensive
to
large
numbers
of
persons,
and
then
you
do
have
to
ask
the
question
“is
it
patently
offensive
to
this
large
group
of
people
who
are
exposed
to
it?”
but
it’s
irrelevant,
it
seems
to
me,
when
you
have
a
situation
where
if
i
choose
to
buy
the
book
and
read
the
book
and
it
doesn’t
offend
me,
then
it
doesn’t
matter
that
that
same
book
would
offend
most
other
people.
the
other
people
don’t
buy
it,
don’t
read
it
and,
therefore,
whether
it
does
or
does
not
offend
them
is
simply
irrelevant.
the
same
thing
is
true
with
regard
to
the
appeal
to
the
current
interest.
now,
the
appeal
to
the
prurient
interest
of
the
average
person
makes
sense
when
you
have,
again,
a
widespread
distribution
to
a
large
number
of
persons
so
you
have
to
then
strike
the
group
that
is
concerned.
but,
when
you
have
a
private
transaction
such
as
you
have
here,
it
simply
doesn’t
matter
that
it
may
appeal
to
the
prurient
interest
of
the
average
person
if
it
does
not
appeal
to
the
prurient
interest
of
the
person
who
reads
it.
this
is
only
the
other
side
really
of
mishkin.
in
mishkin,
your
honor
stated
that
it
was
proper
to
adjust
the
test
depending
upon
the
audience
for
whom
it
is
prepared
and
the
primarily
distributed
to
and,
there,
material
which
would
have
been
perhaps
not
obscene
if
it
was
to
the
average
person
was
found
to
be
obscene
because
it
was
geared
for
a
particular
group
where
we’d
have
a
particular
impact.
now,
i’m
looking
at
the
other
side
of
that
coin.
if
all
we
have
are
consenting
adults,
people
who
are
not
offended,
people
who
do
not
have
their
prurient
interest
appealed
to
by
the
reading
of
this,
people
for
whom
it
does
have
value
even
if
it
would
not
have
value
generally,
then
that
book
to
that
person
under
those
circumstances
simply
is
not
obscene.
for
that
argument,
mr.
justice
blackmun,
of
course,
we
do
not
require
to
go
on
a
standing.
that’s
an
independent
right
because
the
bookseller
has
an
independent
right
to
sell
the
book
now
because,
on
this
argument,
the
book
is
not
obscene
under
a
variable
obscenity
test,
and--
mr.
stanley
fleishman
yes,
your
honor.
that
is
it
talks
in
terms
of
the
audience
and
the
context.
mr.
stanley
fleishman
exactly.
the
third
part
of
the
argument,
insofar
as
this
is
concerned,
is
that
aside
from
everything
else,
if
we
forget
the
variable
obscenity
test,
if
we
forget
the
right
o
read,
this
book
is
simply
not
obscene
under
cases
already
decided
by
this
court.
the
book,
after
all,
is
words
alone.
it
has
no
pictures.
in
terms
of
the
words
used,
they
surely
are
no
stronger,
no
starker
than
the
words
that
are
henry
miller’s
book
and
in
noise
complaint
and
all
around
us,
as
far
as
that’s
concerned,
and
in
terms
of
the
descriptions
that
are
there.
there
comes
a
time,
i
would
respectfully
submit,
that
there’s
nothing
new
that
you
can
say
about
the
subject,
and
that
time
has
simply
come
and
gone.
so
that,
in
every
aspect
of
the
case,
the
book,
it
seems
to
me,
cannot
be
the
basis
of
a
criminal
conviction
such
as
was
involved
here.
if
the
court
please,
i’d
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
stanley
fleishman
yes,
sir,
i
would.
i
think
that
stand
on
exactly
the
same
footing,
the
right
to
get
information
whether
one
gets
it
by
words
or
by
picture
stands
on
the
same
point,
mr.
justice
powell,
in
my
opinion.
i
think
that
the
colloquy
that
justice
marshall
had
with
mr.
mcconnell
points
the
direction,
as
i
see
it,
to
the
solution
in
the
case.
mr.
mcconnell
said
that
as
he
walked
down
washington
somebody
tried
to
hustle
him
into
a
bookstore
and
there
was
no
such
similar
hustling
that
appeared
in
the
case
at
bar.
there’s
nothing
in
the
record
at
all
along
those
lines.
what
we
have
suggested
on
our
papers,
and
i
think
it
is
wise
and
i
think
it
follows
the
opinions
mostly
of
you,
mr.
justice
white,
as
i
understand
them
and,
that
is,
that
a
statute
can
be
good
or
bad
depending
upon
the
record
that
it’s
made.
that
is
my
understanding
of
baird
that,
in
that
case,
it
wasn’t
the
statute
that
your
honor
was
focusing
on
so
much
as
proof
in
the
case.
since
the
state
was
claiming
that
there
was
a
health
hazard,
then
your
honor
quite
properly
said
whether
there
is
any
record
that
this
phone
was
relevant
to
the
health
hazard.
now,
there
are
again
only
two
things
that
the
state
talked
about
in
this
case
or
any
obscenity
cases.
mr.
mcconnell
talks
about
minors
and
he
talks
about
an
obtrusive
kind
of
distribution.
now,
minors
simply
cannot
be
the
basis
of
the
conviction.
it
is
true--
i
suppose
it’s
true
that
if
there
are
books
that
are
on
the
market
generally,
that
some
of
these
books
will
ultimately
find
their
way
to
minors
in
the
same
way
that
if
you
have
automobiles
on
the
road,
i
suppose
that
minors
are
from
time
to
time
going
to
drive
those
automobiles.
and,
in
the
same
way,
if
you
have
cigarettes
being
sold,
that
minors
are
going
to
smoke
cigarettes.
but,
butler
told
us
it
was
reinforced
in
roth
and
it
has
been
restated
every
opportunity
this
court
has
had
an
opportunity
to
talk
about
the
subject,
that
you
cannot
limit
what
adults
are
going
to
read
because
we
are
saying
that
it’s
inappropriate
for
minors.
so
that,
in
this
case,
for
mr.
mcconnell
to
argue
that
to
follow
the
argument
that
we
have
suggested
would
mean
that
there
is
a
greater
likelihood
that
minors
will
get
books
simply
does
not
meet
the
constitutional
issue.
mr.
stanley
fleishman
the
court
has
so
held
in
ginsberg
against
first--
against
new
york
and
we
do
not--
mr.
stanley
fleishman
not
quite.
as
i
read
justice
brennan’s
opinion,
it
was
there
stated
that
the
right
of
a
minor
to
read
did
not
stand
as--
on
as
high
a
footing
as
the
right
of
an
adult
and,
therefore,
since
it
wasn’t
on
the
same
footing
that
the
right
of
the
minor
could
be
interfered
with
by
showing
of
rationality.
now,
it’s
true
that
that
was
a
bookseller
who
was
convicted,
but
the
court
did
talk
about
the
right
of
a
minor
in
that
situation
and
he
didn’t
have--
the
minor
did
not
have
the
same
right.
it’s
what
i
understand
mr.
justice
stewart
was
saying
in
that
opinion.
he
is
saying
it’s
one
thing
to
say
that
the
constitution
protects
absolutely
the
right
of
an
adult
to
read
because
he
is
a
thinking
person,
but
that
a
minor
on
a
theory
that
he
doesn’t
have
the
thinking
processes
yet,
it’s
kind
of
like
an
involuntary
thrusting
upon
a
person
who
is
not
full--
full
thrust--
mr.
stanley
fleishman
exactly,
so
that
my
argument
does
not,
in
any
way,
touch
the
ginsberg’s--
ginsberg
against
new
york
argument,
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
mr.
stanley
fleishman
that
is
correct,
your
honor,
but
this
court,
on
a
number
of
occasions,
has
already
taken
the
step
in
terms
of
saying
that
the
right
of
a
minor
is
not
as
great
as
the
right
of
adult.
your
honors
did
that,
of
course,
in
the
prince
case
in
the
beginning,
came
back
again
in
ginsberg,
and.
it
came
up
in
a
fashion,
i
suppose,
in
the
case--
the
yoder
case,
wisconsin
versus
yoder.
mr.
stanley
fleishman
there
is
certainly
some
latitude.
i
don’t
think
that
i
would
accept
20.
since
a
person
could
vote
at
18,
i
think
that
whenever
you
go
above
18
you’re
going
to
get
into
a
question
of
rationality
but,
certainly,
the
state
does
have
the
right
to
have
a
different
test
for
minors
and,
i
might
add
that,
in
california,
we
do
have
a
minor’s
statute.
in
california,
if
in
fact
there
was
a
sale
to
minors,
there
is
a
specific
statute
which
would
control
that
situation.
now,
the
other
aspect
of
the
case
that
mr.
mcconnell
rise--
raises
is,
one,
is
i
say
is
minors
and
that
certainly
won’t
do
it
and
the
other
is
that
if
you
have
a
rule
such
as
we’re
arguing
for
that
they
may
be,
it
may
end
up
in,
an
obtrusive
thrusting
upon
an
unwilling
audience.
the
simple
answer
to
that
is,
when
that
time
comes,
the
state
of
california
is
absolutely
free
to
charge
a
person,
put
on
proof
of
that,
and
to
convict
him
for
thrusting
it
upon
an
unwilling
audience.
we
do
not
ask,
in
this
case,
that
the
statute
be
touched
at
all.
all
we
say
is
and
all
we
argue
for
is
that
the
state
has
simply
gone
too
far.
it
has
infringed
upon
a
constitutional
right
when
it
has
punished
mr.
kaplan
for
doing
no
more
than
selling
the
book
under
these
circumstances.
now,
there
is
one
or
two
other
things
that
i
would
like
to
touch
on
if
i
may
in
the
brief
time
still
remaining.
mr.
mcconnell
says,
of
course,
griswold
and
baird
stand
on
the
high
ground
that
the
discussion
about
birth
control
is
very
important,
very
fundamental,
and
of
course
the
state
cannot
interfere
with
that.
and
then
he
says
in
a
way
that
i
don’t
quite
understand
that
sex
somehow
is
not
important.
people
somehow
are
not
interested
in
sex,
as
i
hear
mr.
mcconnell’s
argument.
the
simple
fact
is
that
people
are
enormously
interested
in
the
subject.
if
there’s
one
thing
that
we
know,
it
is
that
the
people
buy
books
dealing
with
sex,
very
explicit
books.
they
look
at
films
of
this
kind
and
they
derive
a
great
deal
of
value
from
it.
the
commission
of
upsetting
pornography
spent
some-two
years
engaged
in
an
enormous
amount
of
original
research.
it
engaged
in
a
great
deal
of
scientific
survey
taking
in
terms
of
whom
reads
sexy
books,
why
do
they
read
them,
what
do
they
get
out
of
them,
and
they
have
concluded
that
the
people
who
read
them,
for
the
most
part,
are
middle-aged,
middle-class,
white
people
who
read
them
and
derive
a
great
deal
of
pleasure,
information,
and
satisfactions
from
reading
this.
now,
it
therefore
seems
to
me
to
be
inappropriate
and
wrong
to
make
an
argument
that
griswold
and
baird
will
correctly
decided
it
because
the
discussion
was
about
contraceptives
and
how
to
get--
whether
or
not
one
would
have
children
but,
at
the
same
time,
that
a
book
or
magazine
which
deals
with
sex,
explicit
sexual
material
is
somehow
without
social
value.
it’s
not
the
fact,
and
i
believe
that
the
commission
studies
and
our
whole
history
has
taught
us
that
there
is,
in
fact,
value
in
books
such
as
suite
69
even
if
the
values
do
not
seem
to
include
all
of
us.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
