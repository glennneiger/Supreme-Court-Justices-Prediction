mr.
lee
a.
freeman,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
expression
that
this
is
an
ad
hoc
situation
does
violence
to
this
court’s
standing.
this
court
does
not
deal
with
ad
hoc
situations.
whatever
decisions
made
here
will
have
broad
application
and
involved
principles.
what
is
involved
here
is
the
application
of
the
primary
jurisdiction
principle
and
in
your
recent
decisions,
i
find
the
rule
expressed
as
a
judicial
abstention
where
the
protection
of
the
integrity
of
the
regulatory
system
dictates
primary
result
to
the
agency.
this
was
expressed
in
philadelphia
bank
and
in
carnation
milk
and
in
silver,
a
decision
to
which
i
will
more
fully
refer.
the
important
point
in
these
instances
that
we
don’t
seek
exemption
from
the
antitrust
laws,
we
seek
and
the
seventh
circuit
did
order
a
judicial
abstention
until
the
administrative
agency
had
an
opportunity
to
determine
whether
or
not
there
was
compliance
with
this
particular
exchange
with
its
rules
and
with
the
regulatory
system
established.
mr.
lee
a.
freeman,
jr.
i,
number
one,
the
exchange
if
i
may
answer
your
question
obliquely.
the
exchange
itself
has
a
great,
many
self-regulatory
rules
which
involve
penalties
and
monetary
redress.
the
agency,
the
administrative
agency,
does
not
have
a
power
to
award
damages.
but
as
this
court
said
in
pan
american,
if
the
regulatory
system
is
sufficiently
comprehensive
and
if
it
deals
with
the
issues
that
are
involved,
the
fact
of
an
absence
of
remedy
or
full
remedy
in
that
instance
did
not
violate
the
need
for
primary
jurisdiction
resort
and
in
case
justice
douglas
did.
so
holding
there’ve
been
several
decisions
since
then.
but
let
me
just,
briefly
if
i
may,
indicate
the
scope
and
character
of
the
commodity
futures
regulatory
system.
it
involves
an
important
segment
of
our
economy.
the
quoted
prices
in
a
free
auction
market
become
the
price
basis
for
national
and
international
trade.
it
becomes
the
price
basis
these
quotes
from
day
to
day,
from
hour
to
hour,
from
minute
to
minute
of
the
prices
at
which
the
farmer
sell
their
product
in
the
country.
the
processors
and
exporters
pay
for
that
product
and
the
consumers
also
pay
for
it.
the
principle
feature
of
this
regulatory
system
is
self-regulation
by
the
exchange
mandated
by
congress.
this
is
an
important
difference
from
every
other
regulatory
system
that
this
court
has
considered
in
determining
primary
jurisdiction
except
the
silver
case
where
also
a
self-regulatory
system
was
mandated
by
congress
with
respect
to
the
securities
and
exchange
commission.
mr.
lee
a.
freeman,
jr.
thank
you
justice
marshall.
i
was
trying
to
answer
justice
white’s
inquiry.
the
commodities
exchange
authority
has
delegated
to
the
agency
and
to
the
exchange
almost
complete
authority
to
deal
with
all
of
the
antitrust
problems
that
might
be
involved.
let
me
enumerate
them.
the
act
prevents
or
seeks
to
prevent
manipulation
of
prices
and
imposes
the
first
duty
on
the
exchange
to
do
that.
this
is
price
fixing,
eliminate
price
fixing.
it
does
provide
for
the
prohibition
of
restraints
of
trade
in
that
it
provides
against
specifically
provides
against
various
predatory
practices,
various
unfair
methods
of
competition
and
imposes
that
responsibility
on
the
exchange.
it
seeks
--
mr.
lee
a.
freeman,
jr.
is
the
antitrust
violation
--
mr.
lee
a.
freeman,
jr.
there
would
be
justification.
mr.
lee
a.
freeman,
jr.
in
the
event,
the
rule
that
i
seek
to
apply
here
is
that
in
the
event
the
exchange
were
proceeding
in
good
faith
in
fulfillment
of
its
congressionally
mandated
self-regulatory
system
and
impose
a
limit
on
competition
or
even
a
per
se
what
would
normally
be
a
per
se
antitrust
violation,
it
would
be
justified
and
it
would
be
immunized.
let
me
give
you
an
example.
the
exchange
has
various
types
of
rules.
for
example,
there
is
a
rule
that
prohibits
the
fluctuation
of
daily
future’s
prices
beyond
certain
limit.
a
certain
half
a
day,
up
or
down—
mr.
lee
a.
freeman,
jr.
no,
there
is
--
there
is
no
reference
to
the
antitrust
law
as
anywhere
in
the
statute.
mr.
lee
a.
freeman,
jr.
there
is
no
immunization
by
express
grant.
but
the
whole
system
--
mr.
lee
a.
freeman,
jr.
well,
your
honor
the
system
that
has
been
established
here
and
i
might
say
that
--
i
want
to
ask
you
a
question
directly.
silver,
you
see
found
that
the
securities
and
exchange
commission
did
not
have
the
statutory
power
to
review
particular
instances
of
enforcement
of
exchange
rules.
in
1968,
congress
amended
the
commodities
exchange
act.
the
commodities
exchange
act
incidentally
was
enacted
in
1922.
it
was
the
forerunner
of
the
securities
and
exchange
act.
it
was
the
pioneer
of
marketing
devices
that
will
introduce
then
and
were
ultimately
adopted
by
the
securities
exchange
act
and
the
commission.
and
in
1968,
in
view
of
silver
which
had
been
announced
several
years
prior,
the
statute
was
amended
number
one
to
specifically
grant
the
secretary
and
the
administrative
agency.
the
power
to
disaccrue
rules
that
where
adopted
and
promulgated
by
the
agency
--
by
the
exchange.
secondly
and
most
important
to
impose
a
duty
upon
the
agency
--
upon
the
exchange
to
enforce
those
rules;
and
thirdly
to
require
review
of
the
enforcement
of
those
rules
by
the
administrative
agency
and
in
the
event
of
failure
of
enforcement
to
provoke
disciplinary
action.
the
disciplinary
action
could
take
the
form
a
cease-and-desist
order,
suspension
as
a
designative
contract
market
on
which
futures
trading
only
can
legally
be
performed
or
revocation.
now,
the
primary
jurisdiction
--
mr.
lee
a.
freeman,
jr.
no
damages,
but
you
see
in
the
silver
case,
the
court
recognized
that
there
was
not
this
agency
review.
the
court
as
a
matter
of
fact
spoke
specifically
about
seeking.
and
antitrust
function
to
be
performed
either
by
the
administrative
agency
in
review
of
the
exchanges
function
or
by
the
court
failing
to
find
administrative
review,
the
court
then
turned
to
the
antitrust
laws,
but
was
quick
to
say
that
a
different
case
would
occur
if
agency
review
was
found.
and
also
said,
your
honor
that
in
the
event,
the
agency
review
occurred
that
court
would
find
like
under
the
egis
of
the
rule
of
reason,
the
exchange
would
have
sufficient
breathing
spell
--
a
breathing
space
to
function
as
a
self-regulatory
agency
in
a
very
important
field
and
avoid
the
implications
of
antitrust
claims.
the
functions
that
the
commodities
exchange
authority
and
its
exchange
the
--
in
this
instance
the
chicago
mercantile
exchange
performed
are
very,
very
important.
and
i
was
pointing
out
they
do
have
the
functions
of
avoiding
price
fixing,
of
avoiding
restraints
of
trade,
of
avoiding
monopolization
because
of
this
obligation
to
avoid
corners
of
the
market.
they
are
specific
provisions
in
the
act
providing
for
the
prevention
and
prohibition
of
unfair
methods
of
competition
and
of
predatory
practices.
there
are
specific
provisions
in
the
act
committing
the
exchange
to
past
rules
that
limit
competition.
for
example,
the
exchange
and
the
agency
courses
a
cessation
of
futures
trading
for
a
period
of
time
in
the
contract
months
to
permit
delivery
of
cash
--
the
cash
commodity.
this
is
an
imposition
of
restraint
on
competition.
secondly
as
i
pointed
out,
there
is
this
provision
that
the
exchange
has
always
had
a
hundred
years
of
limiting
the
fluctuation
of
prices
on
a
daily
basis.
this
in
the
parlance
of
antitrust
is
a
per
se
violation,
but
completely
justified.
the
exchange
does
provide
for
hours
of
trade,
time
of
trade,
manner
of
trading
in
future’s
contracts
and
all
to
assure
that
a
free
auction
market
is
maintained
where
the
quoted
prices
truly
reflect
the
competing,
contending,
conflicting
opinions
of
traders
based
upon
informed
judgment
on
economic
factors
that
are
reasonably
presented
in
a
very
complex,
a
very
complex
on
dynamic
marketing
situation.
mr.
lee
a.
freeman,
jr.
yes.
mr.
lee
a.
freeman,
jr.
in
this
instance,
there
is
nothing
more
or
less
than
a
dispute
over
membership.
the
exchange’s
entire
duty
and
responsibility
is
exercised
through
its
members.
the
statute
so
provides.
the
members
are
required
to
report
and
keep
records
subject
to
inspection
and
not
manipulating
all
of
the
circumstances
that
you
can
think
of.
the
membership
becomes
an
important
fulcrum
through
which
this
self-regulatory
duty
is
achieved.
in
this
particular
instance,
ricci
claimed
a
membership
and
there
was
a
membership
dispute.
the
rule
provides
that
where
there
is
an
authorization
to
transfer.
it
becomes
almost
an
administrative
decision
of
the
exchange
to
acknowledge
the
transfer
and
make
a
transfer
of
membership.
in
this
instance,
ricci
objected
after
he
had
been
notified
that
there
was
such
a
movement
of
foot.
mr.
lee
a.
freeman,
jr.
yes.
mr.
lee
a.
freeman,
jr.
oh!
yes.
well,
first
you
see
there
is
the
exchange
procedure
which
has
a
tremendous
amount
of
procedural
due
process.
there
are
all
of
these
exchange
provision
for
arbitration
for
instance
which
was
rejected
here.
there
are
all
these
exchange
provisions
first,
and
then
if
the
exchange
decides
wrongly,
there
is
the
administrative
review
and
the
commission
and
there
is
judicial
review
from
the
commission.
there
is
a
system
established
and
the
system
has
worked
very
well
for
these
52
to
100
years
and
the
antitrust
issues
that
have
been
inherent
in
the
system.
for
example,
you
must
decide
that
the
exchange
has
the
power
to
pass
a
rule
which
in
the
orthodox
sense
might
be
restrictive
of
competition
because
if
you
don’t,
then
you
are
completely
rejecting
the
congressional
mandate
that
this
shall
be
a
free
and
open
auction
market
which
will
avoid
sudden
environment
fluctuation
and
prices
the
way
you’re
dealing
with
traders
on
a
daily
and
almost
momentary
basis.
and
let
me
tell
you
about
the
regulation
that
occurs.
mr.
lee
a.
freeman,
jr.
no!
i
want
you
to
apply
silver
here.
silver
--
the
dictates
of
silver,
of
course
the
primary
jurisdiction
issue
was
not
reached
in
silver
and
it
was
not
reached
in
silver
because
the
court
--
mr.
lee
a.
freeman,
jr.
of
course,
that’s
all
i
would
suggest
and
is
a
matter
of
fact,
i
am
--
i
feel
that
justice
stewart
and
his
dissenting
opinion
in
silver
which
was
referred
to
by
colleague.
justice
stewart
quite
properly
points
out
that
there
must
be
a
delicate
balance
that
the
court
establishes
for
this
mandate
itself
regulatory
agency.
the
balance
between
fulfilling
the
responsibility
of
self-regulation
which
is
anomalous
in
daily
duty
unhindered
and
not
by
the
harassment
of
antitrust
claims
that
every
state
of
--
at
every
step
of
the
way
subject,
however,
to
redress
if
it’s
--
if
it’s
direct
in
its
duties
and
the
rule
being
that
if
it
acts
in
a
good
faith
or
bona
fide
manner
in
fulfillment
of
its
self-regulatory
duties.
it
should
have
some
--
it
should
have
immunity
from
the
antitrust
laws.
there
is
--
you
should
apply
the
rule
of
reasons
for
instance.
justice
brandeis
in
the
case
about
50
years
ago,
board
of
trade
versus
united
states
found
that
--
found
that
an
exchange
that
had
imposed
a
restriction
on
buying
or
selling
at
above
a
certain
price
after
the
market
closed.
he
finds
that
that
was
a
reasonable
regulation
of
competition
which
actually
promoted
competition
in
the
sense
of
maintaining
an
open
auction
market.
with
respect
to
silver,
i
again
emphasize
that
in
silver.
first
the
court
for
the
first
time
had
before
it
a
self-regulating
marketing
system.
the
security
and
exchange
act
which
is
quite
parallel
to
the
commodities
exchange
act
and
as
i
say
that
commodities
exchange
act
was
the
forerunner
of
it
and
was
copied.
in
silver,
the
court
recognized
that
if
there
was
a
place
for
agency
review
that
this
would
dispense
within
necessity
of
antitrust
in
--
antitrust
courts
involvement.
subject
always
to
the
fact
that
if
there
was
some
area
that
--
that
went
beyond
nearly
the
concerted
action
of
the
exchange
within
the
bona
fide
and
good
faith
operation
of
its
self-regulatory
duties.
if
there
was
some
charge
or
some
action
beyond
that,
sure
it
subject
to
the
antitrust
laws.
and
if
there
was
a
remedy
for
damage
issue
that
your
honors
have
raised,
if
there
was
a
remedy
that
the
agency
could
not
grant
after
the
agency
had
determined
that
there
were
violations
here.
that
were
violations
of
the
rules
or
violations
of
antitrust
principles
that
were
covered
by
a
good
faith
compliance
with
self-regulatory
duties,
then
the
case
should
go
back
to
the
court,
to
the
antitrust
court,
for
the
administration
of
that
remedy.
and
the
seventh
circuit
i
think
very
closely
followed
the
silver
dictates
by
providing
for
a
stay
of
the
district
courts
proceedings
until
the
agency
had
completed
its
determination.
and
the
agency
here
is
in
daily
contact
with
the
exchange.
we
have
two
or
three
investigators
on
our
floor
everyday,
all
the
time.
we
are
constantly
subject
to
reporting
and
investigating
process
and
the
exchange
has
a
whole
staff
of
--
which
we
called
department
of
investigation
and
audits
which
is
constantly
involved
in
the
marketing
process.
it’s
a
delicate
process.
it’s
a
subtle
process.
it’s
necessary
to
secure
a
price
quote
that
does
truly
reflect
the
competing
opinions
on
economic
supply
and
demand
factors
rather
than
some
arbitrary
factor.
and
arbitrary
factors
have
a
way
of
entering
into
the
marketplace
from
time
to
time
and
all
of
this
function
is
performed
through
our
members.
and
therefore,
the
ricci
problem
standing
alone
is
not
very
important,
it’s
a
membership
dispute,
but
looking
at
from
the
context
of
the
issue
has
now
presented
to
this
court.
it
means
the
difference
between
encouraging
the
exchange
to
proceed
forcibly
in
its
self-regulatory
duties
under
the
control
of
the
agency
and
subject
to
judicial
review.
the
agency
is
always
subject
to
judicial
review
or
to
be
subject
to
a
great
money
harassments.
let
me
just
point
to
the
dilemma
that
faces
the
chicago
mercantile
exchange
right
now.
in
the
last
several
years,
two
or
three
years,
we’ve
been
suggested
to
possibly
seven
or
ten
suits.
some
for
violation
of
our
rule,
some
for
antitrust
violations,
two
of
them
pending
in
the
seventh
circuit,
i
think
highlight
what
i
would
like
to
emphasize.
in
one
case,
the
exchange’s
investigative
staff
watched
the
trading
in
a
particular
commodity.
and
at
the
end
of
a
contract
month,
instituted
proceedings,
disciplinary
proceedings,
made
charges
of
manipulation
of
the
market
and
violation
of
its
rules
against
a
series
of
members.
there
were
six
weeks
of
hearings
before
the
full
12
men
board
of
governors
that
we
have
and
everyone
attended
for
six
weeks.
when
we
got
through,
we
imposed
the
severest
penalties
in
the
history
of
regulation
of
the
exchanges,
yet
we’re
subject
to
a
lawsuit
in
a
district
court
for
having
violated
our
rules
in
the
antitrust
laws.
take
the
other
side
of
the
coin,
another
case
pending
in
this
seventh
circuit.
in
this
particular
instance,
another
commodity
and
another
time,
in
the
midst
of
trading,
we
found
a
very
large
concentration
of
position
growing
up
which
would
have
distorted
price
quotations,
which
have
preventive
this
market
operating
properly.
so
the
board
entered
and
order
requiring
liquidation
of
position,
a
divestiture
of
interest
in
the
antitrust
funds.
liquidation
of
position,
it
was
a
proper
move
we
thought.
it
did
resolve
in
the
market
totally
liquidation.
no
violent
price
fluctuations
occurred.
what
was
subject
to
an
antitrust
suit
there?
both
cases
pending
in
the
seventh
circuit
and
we
refer
to
them
on
our
briefs.
now,
the
commodities
exchange
authority
and
the
secretary
of
agriculture
and
the
commission
are
on
our
backs
all
the
time
with
respect
to
all
of
these
operations.
they
are
constantly
urging
us
to
deal
frankly
or
vigorously
with
any
instance
of
market
disturbance.
but
when
we
do,
we’re
done
then
when
we
don’t
we’re
down
and
this
is
the
dilemma
that
faces
us
if
we
are
subject
to
constantly
harassing
antitrust
cases.
now,
this
board
has
an
opportunity
of
providing
us
with
a
principle
that
will
permit
us,
vigorous
self-regulatory
powers
and
duties,
and
functions,
and
yet
subjects
us
to
whatever
penalties
are
necessary
because
of
any
exchange
their
election.
we
don’t
profess
to
be
perfect
and
the
system
isn’t
perfect,
but
it
has
worked
and
it
has
worked
well
and
this
now
injections
of
antitrust
attached
and
in
this
instance
with
a
complaint
that’s
demonstrably
false.
on
the
basis
of
depositions
that
were
taken
by
both
sides,
not
one
side,
depositions
that
were
taken
by
both
sides
and
presented
to
the
district
court
by
both
sides
in
their
briefs
which
demonstrate
that
there
was
notice
to
this
individual
that
there
was
an
attempt
to
arbitrate
and
there
was
no
denial
of
it.
mr.
lee
a.
freeman,
jr.
your
honor,
i
am
force
to
say
that
this
particular
district
court
would
have
great
difficulty
understanding
what
the
judge
was
doing,
but
i
have
cited
to
a
transcript
which
indicates
that
he
did
take
it
into
effect.
the
important
point
is
that
the
briefs
that
were
filed
on
the
motion
to
dismiss
and
there
were
motions
to
dismiss,
not
some
of
that.
the
briefs
that
were
filed
did
--
both
briefs
made
mention
to
all
the
depositions.
and
he
did
dispose
of
it
and
he
asked
us
to
file
findings
of
fact
which
we
did
which
would
have
been
under
a
motion
for
summary
judgment,
but
then
decided
that
he
would
just
make
an
oral
judgment.
mr.
lee
a.
freeman,
jr.
the
court
of
appeals
--
the
court
of
appeals
read
the
same
transcript
and
said
he
didn’t
believe.
they
found
that
he
did
not
into
account
anything
beyond
the
motion
to
dismiss.
mr.
lee
a.
freeman,
jr.
and
it
was
a
motion
to
dismiss
and
we
have
an
attack
for
court
of
appeals
decision.
mr.
lee
a.
freeman,
jr.
and
if
you
take
the
allegations
to
the
complainant
as
true,
you’ll
find
that
there
is
an
indication
that
notice
of
the
exchange
actions
did
occur,
but
there’s
also
the
weaselly
whistle
expression
that
they
didn’t
get
notice
of
the
transfer
to
john
wright.
you
know
john
wright
is
somebody
nobody
knows
and
maybe
they
didn’t
get
noticed
of
the
transfer
to
him,
but
they
were
notified
that
the
transfer
issue
was
before
the
board
and
that’s
why
they
came
up
with
an
--
with
an
attempt
to
revoke
that
authorization.
mr.
lee
a.
freeman,
jr.
yes,
i
do
deny
it
because
i
feel
that
the
allegations
of
the
complaint
are
merely
conclusory
allegations
in
an
attempt
to
get
to
a
federal
court
instead
of
a
state
court
where
they
may
have
been
a
commercial
dispute
between
these
two
parties
which
could
have
been
answered
in
the
state
court,
but
instead
they
added
a
few
words
of
willful,
conspiracy,
and
so
on.
and
my
colleague
here
in
presenting
his
case,
quite
properly
pointed
out
that
it
all
it
was
is
the
dispute
between
his
client
and
the
other
client
and
we
decided
it.
and
in
every
decision
that
the
exchange
makes,
there’s
got
to
be
a
losing
party
who
can
contend
that
we
were
conspiring
with
the
other
side
in
violation
of
the
antitrust
law.
mr.
lee
a.
freeman,
jr.
i
think
the
court
of
--
mr.
lee
a.
freeman,
jr.
i
think
the
court
of
appeal
was
wrong
first
in
finding
that
the
complaint
stated
the
proper
course
of
action
and
secondly,
not
finding
that
the
matter
was
handled
by
the
district
court
as
a
motion
summary
judgment.
mr.
lee
a.
freeman,
jr.
no,
no,
i
--
mr.
lee
a.
freeman,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
lee
a.
freeman,
jr.
no
place
for
silver,
a
place
here
and
i
would
--
i
mean
i
think
that
the
issue
of
primary
jurisdiction
should
be
decided
by
this
court
rather
than
to
throw
this
matter
out
as
a
frivolous
complaint.
i
think
the
issue
is
presented
and
you
must
assume
that
the
court
of
appeals
because
that
issue
has
not
been
disputed
here.
the
court
of
appeals
has
decided
that
the
complaint
does
state
an
antitrust
violation
and
you
must
come
to
grips
with
the
problem
of
whether
or
not
the
agency
should
review
to
determine
that
the
exchange
was
acting
in
good
faith.
mr.
lee
a.
freeman,
jr.
that’s
right.
mr.
lee
a.
freeman,
jr.
the
agency
should
deal
with
that
issue
first,
yes
your
honor,
and
i
think
in
that
way,
a
judicial
time
has
saved
the
agency
can
--
there
isn’t
a
proper
accommodation
between
the
two
systems,
the
integrity
of
the
regulatory
system
which
is
the
commodities
exchange
authority
and
the
commission
and
the
secretary
is
preserved
and
you’ll
follow
the
dictates
of
the
various
decision
that
have
recently
been
rendered.
thank
you.
mr.
lee
a.
freeman,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
expression
that
this
is
an
ad
hoc
situation
does
violence
to
this
court’s
standing.
this
court
does
not
deal
with
ad
hoc
situations.
whatever
decisions
made
here
will
have
broad
application
and
involved
principles.
what
is
involved
here
is
the
application
of
the
primary
jurisdiction
principle
and
in
your
recent
decisions,
i
find
the
rule
expressed
as
a
judicial
abstention
where
the
protection
of
the
integrity
of
the
regulatory
system
dictates
primary
result
to
the
agency.
this
was
expressed
in
philadelphia
bank
and
in
carnation
milk
and
in
silver,
a
decision
to
which
i
will
more
fully
refer.
the
important
point
in
these
instances
that
we
don’t
seek
exemption
from
the
antitrust
laws,
we
seek
and
the
seventh
circuit
did
order
a
judicial
abstention
until
the
administrative
agency
had
an
opportunity
to
determine
whether
or
not
there
was
compliance
with
this
particular
exchange
with
its
rules
and
with
the
regulatory
system
established.
mr.
lee
a.
freeman,
jr.
i,
number
one,
the
exchange
if
i
may
answer
your
question
obliquely.
the
exchange
itself
has
a
great,
many
self-regulatory
rules
which
involve
penalties
and
monetary
redress.
the
agency,
the
administrative
agency,
does
not
have
a
power
to
award
damages.
but
as
this
court
said
in
pan
american,
if
the
regulatory
system
is
sufficiently
comprehensive
and
if
it
deals
with
the
issues
that
are
involved,
the
fact
of
an
absence
of
remedy
or
full
remedy
in
that
instance
did
not
violate
the
need
for
primary
jurisdiction
resort
and
in
case
justice
douglas
did.
so
holding
there’ve
been
several
decisions
since
then.
but
let
me
just,
briefly
if
i
may,
indicate
the
scope
and
character
of
the
commodity
futures
regulatory
system.
it
involves
an
important
segment
of
our
economy.
the
quoted
prices
in
a
free
auction
market
become
the
price
basis
for
national
and
international
trade.
it
becomes
the
price
basis
these
quotes
from
day
to
day,
from
hour
to
hour,
from
minute
to
minute
of
the
prices
at
which
the
farmer
sell
their
product
in
the
country.
the
processors
and
exporters
pay
for
that
product
and
the
consumers
also
pay
for
it.
the
principle
feature
of
this
regulatory
system
is
self-regulation
by
the
exchange
mandated
by
congress.
this
is
an
important
difference
from
every
other
regulatory
system
that
this
court
has
considered
in
determining
primary
jurisdiction
except
the
silver
case
where
also
a
self-regulatory
system
was
mandated
by
congress
with
respect
to
the
securities
and
exchange
commission.
mr.
lee
a.
freeman,
jr.
thank
you
justice
marshall.
i
was
trying
to
answer
justice
white’s
inquiry.
the
commodities
exchange
authority
has
delegated
to
the
agency
and
to
the
exchange
almost
complete
authority
to
deal
with
all
of
the
antitrust
problems
that
might
be
involved.
let
me
enumerate
them.
the
act
prevents
or
seeks
to
prevent
manipulation
of
prices
and
imposes
the
first
duty
on
the
exchange
to
do
that.
this
is
price
fixing,
eliminate
price
fixing.
it
does
provide
for
the
prohibition
of
restraints
of
trade
in
that
it
provides
against
specifically
provides
against
various
predatory
practices,
various
unfair
methods
of
competition
and
imposes
that
responsibility
on
the
exchange.
it
seeks
--
mr.
lee
a.
freeman,
jr.
is
the
antitrust
violation
--
mr.
lee
a.
freeman,
jr.
there
would
be
justification.
mr.
lee
a.
freeman,
jr.
in
the
event,
the
rule
that
i
seek
to
apply
here
is
that
in
the
event
the
exchange
were
proceeding
in
good
faith
in
fulfillment
of
its
congressionally
mandated
self-regulatory
system
and
impose
a
limit
on
competition
or
even
a
per
se
what
would
normally
be
a
per
se
antitrust
violation,
it
would
be
justified
and
it
would
be
immunized.
let
me
give
you
an
example.
the
exchange
has
various
types
of
rules.
for
example,
there
is
a
rule
that
prohibits
the
fluctuation
of
daily
future’s
prices
beyond
certain
limit.
a
certain
half
a
day,
up
or
down—
mr.
lee
a.
freeman,
jr.
no,
there
is
--
there
is
no
reference
to
the
antitrust
law
as
anywhere
in
the
statute.
mr.
lee
a.
freeman,
jr.
there
is
no
immunization
by
express
grant.
but
the
whole
system
--
mr.
lee
a.
freeman,
jr.
well,
your
honor
the
system
that
has
been
established
here
and
i
might
say
that
--
i
want
to
ask
you
a
question
directly.
silver,
you
see
found
that
the
securities
and
exchange
commission
did
not
have
the
statutory
power
to
review
particular
instances
of
enforcement
of
exchange
rules.
in
1968,
congress
amended
the
commodities
exchange
act.
the
commodities
exchange
act
incidentally
was
enacted
in
1922.
it
was
the
forerunner
of
the
securities
and
exchange
act.
it
was
the
pioneer
of
marketing
devices
that
will
introduce
then
and
were
ultimately
adopted
by
the
securities
exchange
act
and
the
commission.
and
in
1968,
in
view
of
silver
which
had
been
announced
several
years
prior,
the
statute
was
amended
number
one
to
specifically
grant
the
secretary
and
the
administrative
agency.
the
power
to
disaccrue
rules
that
where
adopted
and
promulgated
by
the
agency
--
by
the
exchange.
secondly
and
most
important
to
impose
a
duty
upon
the
agency
--
upon
the
exchange
to
enforce
those
rules;
and
thirdly
to
require
review
of
the
enforcement
of
those
rules
by
the
administrative
agency
and
in
the
event
of
failure
of
enforcement
to
provoke
disciplinary
action.
the
disciplinary
action
could
take
the
form
a
cease-and-desist
order,
suspension
as
a
designative
contract
market
on
which
futures
trading
only
can
legally
be
performed
or
revocation.
now,
the
primary
jurisdiction
--
mr.
lee
a.
freeman,
jr.
no
damages,
but
you
see
in
the
silver
case,
the
court
recognized
that
there
was
not
this
agency
review.
the
court
as
a
matter
of
fact
spoke
specifically
about
seeking.
and
antitrust
function
to
be
performed
either
by
the
administrative
agency
in
review
of
the
exchanges
function
or
by
the
court
failing
to
find
administrative
review,
the
court
then
turned
to
the
antitrust
laws,
but
was
quick
to
say
that
a
different
case
would
occur
if
agency
review
was
found.
and
also
said,
your
honor
that
in
the
event,
the
agency
review
occurred
that
court
would
find
like
under
the
egis
of
the
rule
of
reason,
the
exchange
would
have
sufficient
breathing
spell
--
a
breathing
space
to
function
as
a
self-regulatory
agency
in
a
very
important
field
and
avoid
the
implications
of
antitrust
claims.
the
functions
that
the
commodities
exchange
authority
and
its
exchange
the
--
in
this
instance
the
chicago
mercantile
exchange
performed
are
very,
very
important.
and
i
was
pointing
out
they
do
have
the
functions
of
avoiding
price
fixing,
of
avoiding
restraints
of
trade,
of
avoiding
monopolization
because
of
this
obligation
to
avoid
corners
of
the
market.
they
are
specific
provisions
in
the
act
providing
for
the
prevention
and
prohibition
of
unfair
methods
of
competition
and
of
predatory
practices.
there
are
specific
provisions
in
the
act
committing
the
exchange
to
past
rules
that
limit
competition.
for
example,
the
exchange
and
the
agency
courses
a
cessation
of
futures
trading
for
a
period
of
time
in
the
contract
months
to
permit
delivery
of
cash
--
the
cash
commodity.
this
is
an
imposition
of
restraint
on
competition.
secondly
as
i
pointed
out,
there
is
this
provision
that
the
exchange
has
always
had
a
hundred
years
of
limiting
the
fluctuation
of
prices
on
a
daily
basis.
this
in
the
parlance
of
antitrust
is
a
per
se
violation,
but
completely
justified.
the
exchange
does
provide
for
hours
of
trade,
time
of
trade,
manner
of
trading
in
future’s
contracts
and
all
to
assure
that
a
free
auction
market
is
maintained
where
the
quoted
prices
truly
reflect
the
competing,
contending,
conflicting
opinions
of
traders
based
upon
informed
judgment
on
economic
factors
that
are
reasonably
presented
in
a
very
complex,
a
very
complex
on
dynamic
marketing
situation.
mr.
lee
a.
freeman,
jr.
yes.
mr.
lee
a.
freeman,
jr.
in
this
instance,
there
is
nothing
more
or
less
than
a
dispute
over
membership.
the
exchange’s
entire
duty
and
responsibility
is
exercised
through
its
members.
the
statute
so
provides.
the
members
are
required
to
report
and
keep
records
subject
to
inspection
and
not
manipulating
all
of
the
circumstances
that
you
can
think
of.
the
membership
becomes
an
important
fulcrum
through
which
this
self-regulatory
duty
is
achieved.
in
this
particular
instance,
ricci
claimed
a
membership
and
there
was
a
membership
dispute.
the
rule
provides
that
where
there
is
an
authorization
to
transfer.
it
becomes
almost
an
administrative
decision
of
the
exchange
to
acknowledge
the
transfer
and
make
a
transfer
of
membership.
in
this
instance,
ricci
objected
after
he
had
been
notified
that
there
was
such
a
movement
of
foot.
mr.
lee
a.
freeman,
jr.
yes.
mr.
lee
a.
freeman,
jr.
oh!
yes.
well,
first
you
see
there
is
the
exchange
procedure
which
has
a
tremendous
amount
of
procedural
due
process.
there
are
all
of
these
exchange
provision
for
arbitration
for
instance
which
was
rejected
here.
there
are
all
these
exchange
provisions
first,
and
then
if
the
exchange
decides
wrongly,
there
is
the
administrative
review
and
the
commission
and
there
is
judicial
review
from
the
commission.
there
is
a
system
established
and
the
system
has
worked
very
well
for
these
52
to
100
years
and
the
antitrust
issues
that
have
been
inherent
in
the
system.
for
example,
you
must
decide
that
the
exchange
has
the
power
to
pass
a
rule
which
in
the
orthodox
sense
might
be
restrictive
of
competition
because
if
you
don’t,
then
you
are
completely
rejecting
the
congressional
mandate
that
this
shall
be
a
free
and
open
auction
market
which
will
avoid
sudden
environment
fluctuation
and
prices
the
way
you’re
dealing
with
traders
on
a
daily
and
almost
momentary
basis.
and
let
me
tell
you
about
the
regulation
that
occurs.
mr.
lee
a.
freeman,
jr.
no!
i
want
you
to
apply
silver
here.
silver
--
the
dictates
of
silver,
of
course
the
primary
jurisdiction
issue
was
not
reached
in
silver
and
it
was
not
reached
in
silver
because
the
court
--
mr.
lee
a.
freeman,
jr.
of
course,
that’s
all
i
would
suggest
and
is
a
matter
of
fact,
i
am
--
i
feel
that
justice
stewart
and
his
dissenting
opinion
in
silver
which
was
referred
to
by
colleague.
justice
stewart
quite
properly
points
out
that
there
must
be
a
delicate
balance
that
the
court
establishes
for
this
mandate
itself
regulatory
agency.
the
balance
between
fulfilling
the
responsibility
of
self-regulation
which
is
anomalous
in
daily
duty
unhindered
and
not
by
the
harassment
of
antitrust
claims
that
every
state
of
--
at
every
step
of
the
way
subject,
however,
to
redress
if
it’s
--
if
it’s
direct
in
its
duties
and
the
rule
being
that
if
it
acts
in
a
good
faith
or
bona
fide
manner
in
fulfillment
of
its
self-regulatory
duties.
it
should
have
some
--
it
should
have
immunity
from
the
antitrust
laws.
there
is
--
you
should
apply
the
rule
of
reasons
for
instance.
justice
brandeis
in
the
case
about
50
years
ago,
board
of
trade
versus
united
states
found
that
--
found
that
an
exchange
that
had
imposed
a
restriction
on
buying
or
selling
at
above
a
certain
price
after
the
market
closed.
he
finds
that
that
was
a
reasonable
regulation
of
competition
which
actually
promoted
competition
in
the
sense
of
maintaining
an
open
auction
market.
with
respect
to
silver,
i
again
emphasize
that
in
silver.
first
the
court
for
the
first
time
had
before
it
a
self-regulating
marketing
system.
the
security
and
exchange
act
which
is
quite
parallel
to
the
commodities
exchange
act
and
as
i
say
that
commodities
exchange
act
was
the
forerunner
of
it
and
was
copied.
in
silver,
the
court
recognized
that
if
there
was
a
place
for
agency
review
that
this
would
dispense
within
necessity
of
antitrust
in
--
antitrust
courts
involvement.
subject
always
to
the
fact
that
if
there
was
some
area
that
--
that
went
beyond
nearly
the
concerted
action
of
the
exchange
within
the
bona
fide
and
good
faith
operation
of
its
self-regulatory
duties.
if
there
was
some
charge
or
some
action
beyond
that,
sure
it
subject
to
the
antitrust
laws.
and
if
there
was
a
remedy
for
damage
issue
that
your
honors
have
raised,
if
there
was
a
remedy
that
the
agency
could
not
grant
after
the
agency
had
determined
that
there
were
violations
here.
that
were
violations
of
the
rules
or
violations
of
antitrust
principles
that
were
covered
by
a
good
faith
compliance
with
self-regulatory
duties,
then
the
case
should
go
back
to
the
court,
to
the
antitrust
court,
for
the
administration
of
that
remedy.
and
the
seventh
circuit
i
think
very
closely
followed
the
silver
dictates
by
providing
for
a
stay
of
the
district
courts
proceedings
until
the
agency
had
completed
its
determination.
and
the
agency
here
is
in
daily
contact
with
the
exchange.
we
have
two
or
three
investigators
on
our
floor
everyday,
all
the
time.
we
are
constantly
subject
to
reporting
and
investigating
process
and
the
exchange
has
a
whole
staff
of
--
which
we
called
department
of
investigation
and
audits
which
is
constantly
involved
in
the
marketing
process.
it’s
a
delicate
process.
it’s
a
subtle
process.
it’s
necessary
to
secure
a
price
quote
that
does
truly
reflect
the
competing
opinions
on
economic
supply
and
demand
factors
rather
than
some
arbitrary
factor.
and
arbitrary
factors
have
a
way
of
entering
into
the
marketplace
from
time
to
time
and
all
of
this
function
is
performed
through
our
members.
and
therefore,
the
ricci
problem
standing
alone
is
not
very
important,
it’s
a
membership
dispute,
but
looking
at
from
the
context
of
the
issue
has
now
presented
to
this
court.
it
means
the
difference
between
encouraging
the
exchange
to
proceed
forcibly
in
its
self-regulatory
duties
under
the
control
of
the
agency
and
subject
to
judicial
review.
the
agency
is
always
subject
to
judicial
review
or
to
be
subject
to
a
great
money
harassments.
let
me
just
point
to
the
dilemma
that
faces
the
chicago
mercantile
exchange
right
now.
in
the
last
several
years,
two
or
three
years,
we’ve
been
suggested
to
possibly
seven
or
ten
suits.
some
for
violation
of
our
rule,
some
for
antitrust
violations,
two
of
them
pending
in
the
seventh
circuit,
i
think
highlight
what
i
would
like
to
emphasize.
in
one
case,
the
exchange’s
investigative
staff
watched
the
trading
in
a
particular
commodity.
and
at
the
end
of
a
contract
month,
instituted
proceedings,
disciplinary
proceedings,
made
charges
of
manipulation
of
the
market
and
violation
of
its
rules
against
a
series
of
members.
there
were
six
weeks
of
hearings
before
the
full
12
men
board
of
governors
that
we
have
and
everyone
attended
for
six
weeks.
when
we
got
through,
we
imposed
the
severest
penalties
in
the
history
of
regulation
of
the
exchanges,
yet
we’re
subject
to
a
lawsuit
in
a
district
court
for
having
violated
our
rules
in
the
antitrust
laws.
take
the
other
side
of
the
coin,
another
case
pending
in
this
seventh
circuit.
in
this
particular
instance,
another
commodity
and
another
time,
in
the
midst
of
trading,
we
found
a
very
large
concentration
of
position
growing
up
which
would
have
distorted
price
quotations,
which
have
preventive
this
market
operating
properly.
so
the
board
entered
and
order
requiring
liquidation
of
position,
a
divestiture
of
interest
in
the
antitrust
funds.
liquidation
of
position,
it
was
a
proper
move
we
thought.
it
did
resolve
in
the
market
totally
liquidation.
no
violent
price
fluctuations
occurred.
what
was
subject
to
an
antitrust
suit
there?
both
cases
pending
in
the
seventh
circuit
and
we
refer
to
them
on
our
briefs.
now,
the
commodities
exchange
authority
and
the
secretary
of
agriculture
and
the
commission
are
on
our
backs
all
the
time
with
respect
to
all
of
these
operations.
they
are
constantly
urging
us
to
deal
frankly
or
vigorously
with
any
instance
of
market
disturbance.
but
when
we
do,
we’re
done
then
when
we
don’t
we’re
down
and
this
is
the
dilemma
that
faces
us
if
we
are
subject
to
constantly
harassing
antitrust
cases.
now,
this
board
has
an
opportunity
of
providing
us
with
a
principle
that
will
permit
us,
vigorous
self-regulatory
powers
and
duties,
and
functions,
and
yet
subjects
us
to
whatever
penalties
are
necessary
because
of
any
exchange
their
election.
we
don’t
profess
to
be
perfect
and
the
system
isn’t
perfect,
but
it
has
worked
and
it
has
worked
well
and
this
now
injections
of
antitrust
attached
and
in
this
instance
with
a
complaint
that’s
demonstrably
false.
on
the
basis
of
depositions
that
were
taken
by
both
sides,
not
one
side,
depositions
that
were
taken
by
both
sides
and
presented
to
the
district
court
by
both
sides
in
their
briefs
which
demonstrate
that
there
was
notice
to
this
individual
that
there
was
an
attempt
to
arbitrate
and
there
was
no
denial
of
it.
mr.
lee
a.
freeman,
jr.
your
honor,
i
am
force
to
say
that
this
particular
district
court
would
have
great
difficulty
understanding
what
the
judge
was
doing,
but
i
have
cited
to
a
transcript
which
indicates
that
he
did
take
it
into
effect.
the
important
point
is
that
the
briefs
that
were
filed
on
the
motion
to
dismiss
and
there
were
motions
to
dismiss,
not
some
of
that.
the
briefs
that
were
filed
did
--
both
briefs
made
mention
to
all
the
depositions.
and
he
did
dispose
of
it
and
he
asked
us
to
file
findings
of
fact
which
we
did
which
would
have
been
under
a
motion
for
summary
judgment,
but
then
decided
that
he
would
just
make
an
oral
judgment.
mr.
lee
a.
freeman,
jr.
the
court
of
appeals
--
the
court
of
appeals
read
the
same
transcript
and
said
he
didn’t
believe.
they
found
that
he
did
not
into
account
anything
beyond
the
motion
to
dismiss.
mr.
lee
a.
freeman,
jr.
and
it
was
a
motion
to
dismiss
and
we
have
an
attack
for
court
of
appeals
decision.
mr.
lee
a.
freeman,
jr.
and
if
you
take
the
allegations
to
the
complainant
as
true,
you’ll
find
that
there
is
an
indication
that
notice
of
the
exchange
actions
did
occur,
but
there’s
also
the
weaselly
whistle
expression
that
they
didn’t
get
notice
of
the
transfer
to
john
wright.
you
know
john
wright
is
somebody
nobody
knows
and
maybe
they
didn’t
get
noticed
of
the
transfer
to
him,
but
they
were
notified
that
the
transfer
issue
was
before
the
board
and
that’s
why
they
came
up
with
an
--
with
an
attempt
to
revoke
that
authorization.
mr.
lee
a.
freeman,
jr.
yes,
i
do
deny
it
because
i
feel
that
the
allegations
of
the
complaint
are
merely
conclusory
allegations
in
an
attempt
to
get
to
a
federal
court
instead
of
a
state
court
where
they
may
have
been
a
commercial
dispute
between
these
two
parties
which
could
have
been
answered
in
the
state
court,
but
instead
they
added
a
few
words
of
willful,
conspiracy,
and
so
on.
and
my
colleague
here
in
presenting
his
case,
quite
properly
pointed
out
that
it
all
it
was
is
the
dispute
between
his
client
and
the
other
client
and
we
decided
it.
and
in
every
decision
that
the
exchange
makes,
there’s
got
to
be
a
losing
party
who
can
contend
that
we
were
conspiring
with
the
other
side
in
violation
of
the
antitrust
law.
mr.
lee
a.
freeman,
jr.
i
think
the
court
of
--
mr.
lee
a.
freeman,
jr.
i
think
the
court
of
appeal
was
wrong
first
in
finding
that
the
complaint
stated
the
proper
course
of
action
and
secondly,
not
finding
that
the
matter
was
handled
by
the
district
court
as
a
motion
summary
judgment.
mr.
lee
a.
freeman,
jr.
no,
no,
i
--
mr.
lee
a.
freeman,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
lee
a.
freeman,
jr.
no
place
for
silver,
a
place
here
and
i
would
--
i
mean
i
think
that
the
issue
of
primary
jurisdiction
should
be
decided
by
this
court
rather
than
to
throw
this
matter
out
as
a
frivolous
complaint.
i
think
the
issue
is
presented
and
you
must
assume
that
the
court
of
appeals
because
that
issue
has
not
been
disputed
here.
the
court
of
appeals
has
decided
that
the
complaint
does
state
an
antitrust
violation
and
you
must
come
to
grips
with
the
problem
of
whether
or
not
the
agency
should
review
to
determine
that
the
exchange
was
acting
in
good
faith.
mr.
lee
a.
freeman,
jr.
that’s
right.
mr.
lee
a.
freeman,
jr.
the
agency
should
deal
with
that
issue
first,
yes
your
honor,
and
i
think
in
that
way,
a
judicial
time
has
saved
the
agency
can
--
there
isn’t
a
proper
accommodation
between
the
two
systems,
the
integrity
of
the
regulatory
system
which
is
the
commodities
exchange
authority
and
the
commission
and
the
secretary
is
preserved
and
you’ll
follow
the
dictates
of
the
various
decision
that
have
recently
been
rendered.
thank
you.
