mr.
jerome
h.
torshen
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
involves
the
issue
of
primary
jurisdiction.
specifically,
the
issue
is
whether
a
complaint
alleging
a
group
boycott
to
exclude
a
competitor
from
the
marketplace
per
se
violation
of
the
sherman
act
brought
against
the
commodity
exchange,
certain
of
its
officer,
a
member
and
another
individual
must
first
be
referred
to
the
commodities
exchange
commission
or
to
the
secretary
of
agriculture
for
decision
before
it
may
be
referred
to
the
district
court,
the
antitrust
court.
very
briefly
and
capsulated,
the
facts
are
that
petitioner
purchased
the
membership
on
the
exchange,
another
member
claimed
to
be
the
owner
of
it.
it
is
alleged
that
the
claimant
induced
the
officers
of
the
exchange
to
transfer
the
membership
to
a
third
party
and
as
a
result
petitioner
was
deprived
of
his
trading
privileges
and
excluded
from
the
marketplace
willfully,
knowingly,
and
maliciously
as
a
result
of
the
conspiracy
between
these
parties.
the
history
of
the
case
too,
must
be
stated
so
that
we
can
get
to
the
issues
and
clear
away
some
of
the
underbrush
that
appears
in
the
brief.
in
the
district
court,
this
case
arose
on
the
pleadings
and
was
resolved
on
motions
to
dismiss
for
lack
of
jurisdiction,
specifically
lack
of
jurisdiction
over
the
subject
matter
for
the
reason
that
the
antitrust
laws
did
not
apply.
in
the
court
of
appeals,
the
court
filed
unanimously
that
the
complaint
did
allege
a
per
se
violation
of
the
sherman
act
and
hands
on
the
pleadings,
reversed
the
district
court.
however
the
court
sua
sponte
without
the
issue
of
having
been
argued,
grieved,
or
raised
at
any
time
during
the
proceedings
in
a
two-to-one
opinion
invoke
the
doctrine
of
primary
jurisdiction
and
directed
that
the
case
be
remanded
to
the
district
court
with
the
directions
that
the
district
court
stay
proceedings
pending
reference
of
the
matter
to
either
the
commodities
exchange
commission
and/or
in
the
terms
of
the
court,
the
secretary
of
agriculture.
i
mentioned
those
facts
because
we
do
have
here
a
case
upon
the
pleadings
although
depositions
had
been
taken
by
one
side
and
are
quoted
in
the
briefs
here
by
respondent.
the
deposition
testimony
is
not
properly
a
part
of
the
record
and
was
rejected
by
the
court
below.
we
think,
your
honors
that
the
extension
of
the
doctrine
of
primary
jurisdiction
in
this
case
involving
commodities
markets
is
particularly
inappropriate
especially
with
regard
to
this
claim
brought
under
the
antitrust
laws
and
particularly
with
regard
to
the
policy
in
support
of
the
private
enforcement
of
antitrust
laws.
it
may
be
well
in
determining
what
the
primary
jurisdiction
or
jurisdiction
if
you
will
of
the
secretary
of
agriculture
is
to
determine
what
his
powers
are
under
the
commodities
exchange
act.
first,
the
act
gives
no
exemption
from
the
antitrust
laws.
secondly,
--
mr.
jerome
h.
torshen
well,
i
think
if
a
rule
would
be
a
violation
of
the
antitrust
laws,
i
suppose
that
could
be
attacked
here
of
course
we’re
not
--
mr.
jerome
h.
torshen
absolutely
not.
i
think
the
mere
disapproval
should
not
ren
--
their
failure
to
disapprove
should
not
render
--
mr.
jerome
h.
torshen
with
regard
to
trading
requirements
and
terms
and
conditions
of
contracts
this
is
the
case.
the
secretary
--
mr.
jerome
h.
torshen
yes,
we
would
think
that
it
is.
yes,
your
honor.
here
we
are
not
attacking
any
rule
of
the
exchange.
the
allegations
are
that
the
actions
of
the
exchange
in
consort
with
the
number
and
again
we’re
not
talking
about
the
generalized
action
of
the
exchange
as
a
consort
of
its
membership
but
the
action
of
the
exchange
and
a
member
in
specific
violation
of
the
rule
constituted
a
violation
of
the
antitrust
laws.
and
if
we
examine
the
statutory
scheme
to
see
what
the
secretary
of
agriculture
can
do
in
addition
to
this
ability
if
he
so
sees
fit
to
disapprove
certain
rules
pertaining
to
trading
or
terms
and
conditions
of
contracts,
he
can
conduct
investigations,
make
reports,
obtain
registrations,
approve
certain
rules
relating
to
minimum
financial
requirements,
hold
hearings
with
regard
the
manipulations
of
future’s
prices,
false
statements
and
cea
violations.
he
can
suspend
from
trading
and
he
can
report
for
criminal
prosecution
violation
of
the
act.
although,
it
specifically
provided
that
he
need
not
report
what
he
considers
to
be
minor
violations
of
the
act.
certainly,
here
what
we
have
on
the
part
of
the
regulatory
officer
is
a
generalize
supervisory
power
to
guard
against
certain
trading
abuses.
not
the
power
to
setup
or
to
establish
any
overall
scheme
or
plan
or
even
to
enforce
or
protect
against
violations
of
those
rules
which
are
setup.
it’s
a
very
generalized
type
of
system,
and
there
is
nothing
in
the
character
and
objectives
of
the
act
which
is
incompatible
with
the
maintenance
of
a
private
antitrust
action
for
those
sorts
of
violations
that
are
alleged
in
this
particular
complaint.
there
is
nothing
in
the
regulatory
scheme,
which
might
enable
the
secretary
of
agriculture
or
the
commodities
exchange
commission
which
is
sort
of
a
femoral
body
composed
of
the
secretary
of
commerce,
the
secretary
of
agriculture
and
the
attorney
general,
their
representatives
with
power
which
in
anyway
gives
them
power
to
enforce
or
consider
antitrust
objectives
or
antitrust
claims.
the
court
over
the
years
has
developed
a
number
of
standards
or
tests
relating
to
the
doctrine
of
primary
jurisdiction
granted
it’s
a
flexible
concept
and
no
particular
rule
can
be
applied
in
any
given
case.
but
there
are
standards
which
the
cases
have
developed.
there’s
a
requirement
of
a
pervasive
regulatory
scheme
and
i
think
here
we
do
not
have
such
a
pervasive
regulatory
scheme.
and
the
court
has
been
very
careful
to
delineate
an
exemption
from
the
antitrust
law
either
specifically
stated
in
the
regulatory
statute
or
implied
therein
and
we
have
no
such
exemption
stated
in
the
statute
nor
in
this
general
supervisory
scheme
to
perhaps
protect
someone
against
cornering
and
manipulation
do
we
have
an
implied
exemption?
and
it’s
interesting
to
note
in
this
regard
what
reference
can
be
made
to
the
legislative
history,
the
commodities
exchange
act
and
its
predecessors
were
both
drafted
by
congresses
which
were
well
aware
of
antitrust
laws
and
antitrust
implications.
the
predecessors
came
about
during
the
debates
on
the
(inaudible)
that
act
in
which
there
were
specific
antitrust
exemptions
and
the
present
commodities
exchange
act
was
enacted
by
the
congress
and
debated
contemporaneously
with
the
robinson-patman
act.
so
certainly
here,
we’re
dealing
with
statutes
which
were
enacted
by
congress
which
were
well-aware
of
the
antitrust
laws.
and
these
statutes
give
neither
to
the
secretary
of
agriculture
nor
to
any
other
body
the
power
to
and
grant
an
immunity
from
the
antitrust
laws,
or
to
enforce
that
act
immunity,
nor
do
they
give
a
mechanism
to
readdress
a
violation
or
to
determine
issues
which
might
be
brought
under
the
antitrust
laws.
in
fact,
it’s
interesting
to
note
that
under
the
act
if
petitioner
felt
himself
aggrieved,
he
could
bring
a
complaint
before
the
secretary
of
agriculture
but
he
would
not
have
standing
unless
he
was
given
the
right
to
intervene
to
appear
in
support
of
that
complain.
moreover,
we
have
no
conduct
such
as
we
find
in
some
of
the
other
cases
dealing
with
primary
jurisdiction,
which
is
of
at
least
debatable
legality
which
can
be
justified
with
reference
to
some
broad
plans
set
down
by
the
agency
or
by
agency
action,
or
by
the
need
within
the
particular
industry
for
some
sort
of
noncompetitive
action
imposed
upon
the
members
of
the
industry
by
the
agency.
we
just
don’t
have
it
here.
moreover,
action
in
this
ad
hoc
situation
by
the
district
court
acting
as
antitrust
court
cannot
in
any
way
disrupt
he
administration
of
the
commodities
exchange
act
or
impinge
upon
the
regulation
of
this
contract
market.
we
have
here
an
ad
hoc
decision,
which
we
ask
to
be
made
in
connection
with
particular
facts
relating
to
this
petitioner.
there
is
no
question
of
uniformity
of
agency
rule.
we
are
dealing
with
a
past
violation.
incidentally,
it’s
interesting
to
note
that
with
regard
to
the
powers
of
the
agency
in
this
case
to
give
redress
for
wrongs
to
individuals,
there
are
none.
the
agency
can
issue
a
seize-and-desist
order.
it
can
suspend
from
trading.
it
can
apply
various
similar
sanctions
or
it
can
refer
to
the
attorney
general
for
the
prosecution
of
a
crime.
but
it
can’t
give
the
particular
remedy
of
damages
which
might
redress
a
private
wrong.
and
in
this
particular
case,
when
we’re
dealing
with
a
resolution
of
a
fact
controversy
and
the
application
of
the
antitrust
laws
there's
nothing
in
the
history
or
in
the
record
or
in
common
sense
which
might
give
to
the
agency
a
greater
expertise
than
the
antitrust
court
in
deciding
these
issues.
and
it’s
ironic
to
know,
i
think
here
as
we
stand
before
this
court,
that
even
though
people
do
not
like
to
make
work
for
themselves
agencies
are
generally
jealous
of
their
prerogatives
and
their
powers.
and
we
don’t
see
the
secretary
of
agriculture
here
and
the
only
member
of
the
(inaudible)
that
we
do
see
here
that’s
a
member
of
the
commodities
exchange
commission
is
the
attorney
general
who
has
filed
his
brief
in
support
of
petitioner’s
claim
as
amicus.
again,
we’re
not
making
an
attack
on
the
rules.
we
think
the
rules
have
been
violated
and
they’ve
been
violated
by
the
exchange
acting
with
one
of
its
members
not
just
because
of
generalized
conduct
of
the
exchange.
we
think
your
honors
that
there
is
no
good
policy
reason
that
might
protect
this
sort
of
anticompetitive
behavior
or
to
be
used
to
permit
the
exchange
machinery
to
be
used
to
suppress
competition
on
the
exchange.
we
think
we
have
nothing
more
here
than
a
garden
variety,
conspiracy
to
exclude
a
member
from
the
market.
again,
referring
to
silver
and
the
footnote
in
the
dissent
by
mr.
justice
stewart,
we’re
dealing
with
a
specific
act
of
a
member
of
the
exchange
setting
up
an
independent
violation
of
the
antitrust
laws
as
distinguished
from
the
generalized
conduct.
we
think
this
court
over
the
years
has
considered
the
policy
of
private
antitrust
enforcement
to
be
an
important
one.
certainly
here,
it
would
not
surprise
me
if
the
secretary
of
agriculture
would
say
that
this
conduct
with
regard
the
petitioner
was
a
minor
violation
of
the
exchange.
i
don’t
think
that
it
rests
upon
the
government
or
governmental
bodies
to
seek
redress
for
every
antitrust
wrong.
i
think
that’s
why
its
been
left
to
private
parties
and
here
we
have
a
case
in
which
there
is
a
good
example
of
a
private
party
seeking
redress
and
seeking
enforcement
of
the
antitrust
laws
in
an
area
where
only
he
can
seek
redress.
we
think
the
action
of
the
court
below,
the
court
of
appeals,
in
limiting
and
seeking
to
limit
trouble
damage
action
or
to
delay
that
action
over
a
period
of
time
really
doesn’t
accomplish
the
purposes
of
the
antitrust
laws
certainly
doesn’t
advance
the
cause
of
justice
in
this
case.
and
in
all
due
conscience
and
propriety
we
think
that
the
doctrine
of
primary
jurisdiction,
a
doctrine
of
judicial
modesty
should
not
be
applied
in
this
case.
mr.
jerome
h.
torshen
no,
i
don’t
think
that
a
reply
is
necessary,
your
honor.

considers
to
be
minor
violations
of
the
act.
certainly,
here
what
we
have
on
the
part
of
the
regulatory
officer
is
a
generalize
supervisory
power
to
guard
against
certain
trading
abuses.
not
the
power
to
setup
or
to
establish
any
overall
scheme
or
plan
or
even
to
enforce
or
protect
against
violations
of
those
rules
which
are
setup.
it’s
a
very
generalized
type
of
system,
and
there
is
nothing
in
the
character
and
objectives
of
the
act
which
is
incompatible
with
the
maintenance
of
a
private
antitrust
action
for
those
sorts
of
violations
that
are
alleged
in
this
particular
complaint.
there
is
nothing
in
the
regulatory
scheme,
which
might
enable
the
secretary
of
agriculture
or
the
commodities
exchange
commission
which
is
sort
of
a
femoral
body
composed
of
the
secretary
of
commerce,
the
secretary
of
agriculture
and
the
attorney
general,
their
representatives
with
power
which
in
anyway
gives
them
power
to
enforce
or
consider
antitrust
objectives
or
antitrust
claims.
the
court
over
the
years
has
developed
a
number
of
standards
or
tests
relating
to
the
doctrine
of
primary
jurisdiction
granted
it’s
a
flexible
concept
and
no
particular
rule
can
be
applied
in
any
given
case.
but
there
are
standards
which
the
cases
have
developed.
there’s
a
requirement
of
a
pervasive
regulatory
scheme
and
i
think
here
we
do
not
have
such
a
pervasive
regulatory
scheme.
and
the
court
has
been
very
careful
to
delineate
an
exemption
from
the
antitrust
law
either
specifically
stated
in
the
regulatory
statute
or
implied
therein
and
we
have
no
such
exemption
stated
in
the
statute
nor
in
this
general
supervisory
scheme
to
perhaps
protect
someone
against
cornering
and
manipulation
do
we
have
an
implied
exemption?
and
it’s
interesting
to
note
in
this
regard
what
reference
can
be
made
to
the
legislative
history,
the
commodities
exchange
act
and
its
predecessors
were
both
drafted
by
congresses
which
were
well
aware
of
antitrust
laws
and
antitrust
implications.
the
predecessors
came
about
during
the
debates
on
the
(inaudible)
that
act
in
which
there
were
specific
antitrust
exemptions
and
the
present
commodities
exchange
act
was
enacted
by
the
congress
and
debated
contemporaneously
with
the
robinson-patman
act.
so
certainly
here,
we’re
dealing
with
statutes
which
were
enacted
by
congress
which
were
well-aware
of
the
antitrust
laws.
and
these
statutes
give
neither
to
the
secretary
of
agriculture
nor
to
any
other
body
the
power
to
and
grant
an
immunity
from
the
antitrust
laws,
or
to
enforce
that
act
immunity,
nor
do
they
give
a
mechanism
to
readdress
a
violation
or
to
determine
issues
which
might
be
brought
under
the
antitrust
laws.
in
fact,
it’s
interesting
to
note
that
under
the
act
if
petitioner
felt
himself
aggrieved,
he
could
bring
a
complaint
before
the
secretary
of
agriculture
but
he
would
not
have
standing
unless
he
was
given
the
right
to
intervene
to
appear
in
support
of
that
complain.
moreover,
we
have
no
conduct
such
as
we
find
in
some
of
the
other
cases
dealing
with
primary
jurisdiction,
which
is
of
at
least
debatable
legality
which
can
be
justified
with
reference
to
some
broad
plans
set
down
by
the
agency
or
by
agency
action,
or
by
the
need
within
the
particular
industry
for
some
sort
of
noncompetitive
action
imposed
upon
the
members
of
the
industry
by
the
agency.
we
just
don’t
have
it
here.
moreover,
action
in
this
ad
hoc
situation
by
the
district
court
acting
as
antitrust
court
cannot
in
any
way
disrupt
he
administration
of
the
commodities
exchange
act
or
impinge
upon
the
regulation
of
this
contract
market.
we
have
here
an
ad
hoc
decision,
which
we
ask
to
be
made
in
connection
with
particular
facts
relating
to
this
petitioner.
there
is
no
question
of
uniformity
of
agency
rule.
we
are
dealing
with
a
past
violation.
incidentally,
it’s
interesting
to
note
that
with
regard
to
the
powers
of
the
agency
in
this
case
to
give
redress
for
wrongs
to
individuals,
there
are
none.
the
agency
can
issue
a
seize-and-desist
order.
it
can
suspend
from
trading.
it
can
apply
various
similar
sanctions
or
it
can
refer
to
the
attorney
general
for
the
prosecution
of
a
crime.
but
it
can’t
give
the
particular
remedy
of
damages
which
might
redress
a
private
wrong.
and
in
this
particular
case,
when
we’re
dealing
with
a
resolution
of
a
fact
controversy
and
the
application
of
the
antitrust
laws
there's
nothing
in
the
history
or
in
the
record
or
in
common
sense
which
might
give
to
the
agency
a
greater
expertise
than
the
antitrust
court
in
deciding
these
issues.
and
it’s
ironic
to
know,
i
think
here
as
we
stand
before
this
court,
that
even
though
people
do
not
like
to
make
work
for
themselves
agencies
are
generally
jealous
of
their
prerogatives
and
their
powers.
and
we
don’t
see
the
secretary
of
agriculture
here
and
the
only
member
of
the
(inaudible)
that
we
do
see
here
that’s
a
member
of
the
commodities
exchange
commission
is
the
attorney
general
who
has
filed
his
brief
in
support
of
petitioner’s
claim
as
amicus.
again,
we’re
not
making
an
attack
on
the
rules.
we
think
the
rules
have
been
violated
and
they’ve
been
violated
by
the
exchange
acting
with
one
of
its
members
not
just
because
of
generalized
conduct
of
the
exchange.
we
think
your
honors
that
there
is
no
good
policy
reason
that
might
protect
this
sort
of
anticompetitive
behavior
or
to
be
used
to
permit
the
exchange
machinery
to
be
used
to
suppress
competition
on
the
exchange.
we
think
we
have
nothing
more
here
than
a
garden
variety,
conspiracy
to
exclude
a
member
from
the
market.
again,
referring
to
silver
and
the
footnote
in
the
dissent
by
mr.
justice
stewart,
we’re
dealing
with
a
specific
act
of
a
member
of
the
exchange
setting
up
an
independent
violation
of
the
antitrust
laws
as
distinguished
from
the
generalized
conduct.
we
think
this
court
over
the
years
has
considered
the
policy
of
private
antitrust
enforcement
to
be
an
important
one.
certainly
here,
it
would
not
surprise
me
if
the
secretary
of
agriculture
would
say
that
this
conduct
with
regard
the
petitioner
was
a
minor
violation
of
the
exchange.
i
don’t
think
that
it
rests
upon
the
government
or
governmental
bodies
to
seek
redress
for
every
antitrust
wrong.
i
think
that’s
why
its
been
left
to
private
parties
and
here
we
have
a
case
in
which
there
is
a
good
example
of
a
private
party
seeking
redress
and
seeking
enforcement
of
the
antitrust
laws
in
an
area
where
only
he
can
seek
redress.
we
think
the
action
of
the
court
below,
the
court
of
appeals,
in
limiting
and
seeking
to
limit
trouble
damage
action
or
to
delay
that
action
over
a
period
of
time
really
doesn’t
accomplish
the
purposes
of
the
antitrust
laws
certainly
doesn’t
advance
the
cause
of
justice
in
this
case.
and
in
all
due
conscience
and
propriety
we
think
that
the
doctrine
of
primary
jurisdiction,
a
doctrine
of
judicial
modesty
should
not
be
applied
in
this
case.
mr.
jerome
h.
torshen
no,
i
don’t
think
that
a
reply
is
necessary,
your
honor.
