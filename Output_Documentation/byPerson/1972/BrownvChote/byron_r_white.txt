would
you
take
the

position
in
the
district
court
as
you
did
here,
as
you
are
arguing
here?
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
the
district
court
was
quite
right
when
it
said
since
no
showing
has
been
made
by
the
state
concerning
either
the
necessity,
the
purpose
or
the
reasonableness
of
the
filing
fee
statutes
in
question
we
conclude
that
they’re
invalid?
justice
byron
r.
white
i’m
just
interested
--
justice
byron
r.
white
you
didn’t
even
make
the
argument
or
the
showing
that
you
are
now
presenting
here
in
this
court?
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
you
made
--
you
made
the
argument
that
this
was
necessary
to
keep
a
non-serious
candidates
off
the
ballot?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
what
that
--
what’s
the
source
of
this
statement
then
that
you
made
no
showing,
is
it
that
there
wasn’t
evidence
introduced
--
justice
byron
r.
white
but,
it
maybe
that
the
--
maybe
that
you
can
say
the
state
has
a
legitimate
interest
in
doing
what
it
is
doing,
for
a
legitimate
interest
in
limiting
the
ballot,
but
don’t
you
also
have
to
demonstrate
that
what
you
are
doing
contributes
to
that
end,
substantially
contributes
to
that
end.
your
opponent
argues
that
it
does
contribute
anything
to
that
end
really
because
of
anybody
with
money
can
get
on
whether
he
is
serious
or
not
and
the
people
who
can’t
afford
it
may
be
kept
off
even
if
they
are
quite
serious.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that
was
so
easy,
if
it's
so
easy,
the
state
interest
isn’t
served
anyway?
