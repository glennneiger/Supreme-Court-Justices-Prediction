mr.
henry
g.
ullerich
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
constitutionality
of
the
california
candidate
filing
fee
system
is
the
subject
of
this
direct
appeal
on
the
judgment
of
a
three-judge
federal
district
court,
granting
a
preliminary
injunction
against
the
california
secretary
of
state
and
the
various
county
clerks
in
the
state
of
california.
the
injunction
in
affect
mandated
the
california
secretary
of
state
to
accept
declarations
of
candidacy
in
the
last
primary
election
without
payment
of
the
statutory
candidate
filing
fee
of
1%
of
the
annual
salary
of
the
office
sought.
at
least
as
to
those
members
of
the
class
of
the
plaintiff
below
who
were
willing
to
file
an
affidavit
with
the
county
clerk
that
they
had
insufficient
money
or
property
to
personally
pay
the
candidate
filing
fee.
the
issues
presented
by
this
appeal
from
the
judgment
granting
a
preliminary
injunction
is,
does
california
elections
code,
section
6552,
which
imposes
the
statutory
filing
fee
violate
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
united
states
constitution.
subsidiary
issue
is
what
is
the
appropriate
standard
of
review
when
this
statute
is
challenged
in
the
judicial
proceeding.
an
additional
issue
is
whether
this
case
is
controlled
by
the
decision
last
term
in
bullock
versus
carter,
405
u.s.
134
and
the
final
issue
is
if
a
less
stringent
standard
of
review
is
applicable
herein,
other
than
the
standard
imposed
in
the
bullock
case,
does
the
california
candidate
filing
fee
have
a
rational
basis
which
would
be
sustained
under
the
traditional
rational
basis
test
under
the
equal
protection
clause?
factually,
california
requires
a
party
primary
election
in
even
numbered
years
preceding
the
general
election.
for
the
name
of
a
candidate
to
appear
on
the
primary
ballot
in
june
of
even
numbered
years,
the
candidate
must
obtain
declaration
of
candidacy
forms
from
the
county
clerk
and
at
that
time,
he
is
required
to
pay
a
candidate
filing
fee.
there
is
no
method
for
a
candidate’s
name
to
appear
on
the
primary
ballot
without
paying
the
candidate
filing
fee.
basically
for
state
or
federal
office,
that
fee
is
either
1%
or
2%
of
the
annual
salary
of
the
office.
mr.
henry
g.
ullerich
the
answer
to
that
i
believe,
your
honor,
is
that
the
--
a
particular
flat
fee
over
the
years
with
the
inflation
that
we
have
would
tend
to
be
perhaps
minimal
at
one
period
of
time
and
then
become
rather
excessive
in
other
periods
of
inflation
or
depression
periods.
i
think
the
annual
salary,
i
mean,
the
basis
the
annual
salary
is
pegged
in
more
to
the
actual
benefits
at
the
end
of
a
rainbow,
if
you
will,
and
as
the
salary
changes,
the
fee
also
changes
somewhat.
i
think
also,
there
is
a
consideration
of
rather
than
being
pegged
at
a
very
minimal
fee
of
say,
as
was
suggested
in
one
case
of
$10.00
or
$15.00
to
handle
the
actual
cost
of
handling
the
papers
would
not
achieve
the
state
objective
that
these
candidate
filing
fees
are
designed
achieve,
that
is
to
avoid
overcrowding
of
the
ballots
fragmentation
of
votes
or
discouraging
frivolous
candidates.
the
fee
must
be
something
more
than
a
merely
nominal
fee
to
accomplish
that
purpose.
mr.
henry
g.
ullerich
that
is
true,
your
honor.
as
you’ll
see
from
our
statutes
that
are
reported
in
our
brief
that
these
would
vary
from
no
fee
at
all,
if
there
is
really
no
compensation
for
the
office
to
1%
or
2%,
and
the
distinction
for
the
1%
or
2%
that
seems
to
be
apparent
in
the
statute
is
that
let's
say
statewide
office,
for
instance
the
united
state
senate
or
a
governor
or
lieutenant
governor
and
so
forth,
there
would
be
some
activity
on
the
part
of
58
county
clerks
or
county
registrars
or
voters
in
regard
to
that
particular
candidate
whereas
if
you’re
running
from
a
particular
district
such
a
member
of
congress
or
state
assembly
or
state
senator,
there
is
usually
only
one
particular
county
or
a
limited
district
that
would
be
involved
in
processing
those
papers.
mr.
henry
g.
ullerich
that
would
be
true,
your
honor.
i
think
we
have
--
we
are
not
riding
on
our
clean
slate
anymore
following
that
language
in
bullock.
as
we
pointed
out
in
our
brief
down
in
new
mexico,
a
federal
district
court
invalidated
the
6%
of
the
annual
salary
filing
fee
for
candidates
for
the
united
state
senate.
following
that
federal
district
court
ruling,
there
were
40
candidates
who
filed
for
the
united
state
senate
and
appeared
on
that
ballot.
only
four
of
which
paid
the
candidate
filing
fee.
we
haven't
had
a
real
experience
in
california
because
the
decision
below
was
rendered
on
march
9,
1972.
march
10th
was
the
cutoff
date
for
candidates
to
get
their
declarations
of
candidacy
and
their
sponsor
certificates
into
the
county
clerk.
so
with
the
limited
publicity
and
the
limited
time,
we
haven't
had
the
full
experience.
but
if
we
can
extrapolate
a
little
bit
from
new
mexico
to
take,
say
the
city
of
los
angeles,
if
one
candidate
for
every
50,000
people
would
appear
on
the
ballot,
we
would
have
like
50
candidates
running
for
mayor
of
the
city
of
the
los
angeles,
and
certainly
there
has
to
be
something,
some
gauge
to
make
sure
that
candidates
have
a
modicum
of
support
and
a
sufficient
backing
to
really
be
termed
a
serious
candidate.
mr.
henry
g.
ullerich
and
one
--
mr.
henry
g.
ullerich
well,
i
think
the
reasons
we
have
to
give
for
that
is
really
by
history
of
a
candidate
filing
fee,
your
honor
is
that,
the
part
of
it,
the
--
these
candidate
filing
fees
came
into
avoid
this
overcrowding.
really
the
theory
was
to
give
people
a
more
rational
choice
by
limiting
their
choice
somewhat.
if
you
have
too
many
candidates,
you
really
couldn’t
understand
all
of
the
issues
in
the
candidate.
you
couldn’t
really
make
a
rational
decision
and
secondly,
we
have
certain
limitations
like
in
california
--
mr.
henry
g.
ullerich
yes.
well,
what
i’m
saying
also
was
in
58
counties
in
california
--
mr.
henry
g.
ullerich
well,
this
is
on
the
gross.
mr.
henry
g.
ullerich
for
instance,
for
a
member
of
congress
which
is
42,500,
the
fee
would
be
$425.00,
and
--
mr.
henry
g.
ullerich
well,
i’m
saying
really
that
the
personal
well
for
lack
of
wealth
of
the
individual
candidate
is
really
not
the
critical
issue
is
that,
we
all
know
campaigns
cost
a
lot
of
money
that
mayor
may
not
be
a
good
thing
but
campaign’s
cost
a
lot
of
money.
i
think
at
the
last
election,
the
newspapers
were
talking
about
$400
million
from
contributions
to
candidate.
and
what
i’m
saying
is
if
it
takes
candidates
say
spend
$50,000
or
a
$100,000.00
to
run
to
be
a
member
in
congress,
if
you
have
sufficient
support
in
your
community
or
your
interest
group
to
be
a
serious
candidate
for
that
position
and
there’s
nothing
in
the
law
that
say
that
the
$425.00
can’t
come
from
contributions
of
your
supporters.
is
that
really
that
that
is
a
fee
that
just
substantial
enough
to
really
make
sure
that
you’re
going
to
make
a
serious
run
for
this
office.
mr.
henry
g.
ullerich
no,
i’m
saying
that
a
poor
man
has
a
good
chance
of
running.
if
he
goes
out
--
we
have
something
different
--
mr.
henry
g.
ullerich
poor
man
without
a
rich
friend?
he
would
have
--
mr.
henry
g.
ullerich
he
would
have
to
--
if
he
wants
to
run
--
run
in
the
spring
of
1974
for
instance
he
knows
what
our
statutory
fee
is
and
has
been
for
good
many
years.
he
knows
a
long
way
in
advance
as
to
how
much
money
he
is
going
to
have
to
gather
from
contributions,
from
friends,
relatives
and
supporters
to
really
conduct
a
serious
campaign.
and
one
facet
of
that,
that
he
is
going
to
have
to
consider
is
he
at
least
going
to
have
to
raise
the
filing
fee
before
his
name
is
going
to
appear
in
the
ballot.
mr.
henry
g.
ullerich
we,
that
as
an
example,
yes
your
honor.
we’re
saying
that
--
it
was
part
of
our
point
that
the
personal
wealth
or
the
lack
of
property
of
the
individual
should
really
not
be
that
significant.
if
he’s
meeting
in
his
locality,
if
he’s
gearing
up
to
run
for
the
office,
he
really
can
go
around
and
collect
the
dollar
or
two
from
his
supporters
and
if
he’s
really
a
serious
candidate,
that
should
not
be
an
insurmountable
burden
to
keep
him
off
the
ballot.
mr.
henry
g.
ullerich
yes
your
honor,
we
agree
with
that,
is
that
this
is
merely
a
threshold
requirement
really
to
test
his
seriousness
as
to
whether
he
has
a
sufficient
backing
in
the
community
to
take
a
place
on
the
ballot
and
we
have
to
consider
also,
on
with
the
various
types
of
machines.
we
don’t
have
one
standard
type
of
machine
in
california.
some
counties
have
voting
machines,
some
counties
have
automatic-type
no
books
that
open
up
and
i
think
the
number
of
candidates
and
issues
appear
on
the
ballot
is
a
serious
consideration
nowadays.
you
may
have
seen
the
one
we
have
the
primary
in
california
in
1972,
due
to
the
length
of
time,
it
was
taking
people
to
vote
in
san
francisco
the
polls
there
remained
open
an
additional
three
hours
to
allow
people
to
vote.
i
think
that
this
--
mr.
henry
g.
ullerich
that
was
one
of
considerations,
yes.
the
length
of
--
mr.
henry
g.
ullerich
well
as
i
said,
the
decision
in
the
case
was
on
march
9,
1972
and
there
was
only
a
period
of
24
hours
for
people
to
learn
about
the
decision.
the
members
of
the
class
represent
by
appellee
and
go
out
and
obtain
the
papers
from
the
county
clerk,
go
out
and
get
the
required
number
of
signatures
from
their
supporters
and
get
back
into
the
county
clerks.
so,
we
really
haven't
had
a
real
live
experience
of
it.
mr.
henry
g.
ullerich
that’s
true
your
honor.
mr.
henry
g.
ullerich
that
would
be
inclined
to
agree
with
that
and
i
also
would
add
that
the
way
that
our
election
system
has
been
operating
for
a
substantial
period
of
time,
you
really
can’t
separate
the
two
to
determine
a
serious
candidate.
perhaps,
if
we
had
some
other
method
or
campaign
financing
we
wouldn’t
have
that
problem,
but
they
way
that
was
setup
at
the
present
time,
money
and
serious
candidacy
appear
to
go
hand-in-hand.
mr.
henry
g.
ullerich
in
california,
there
is
a
division
between
the
counties
and
the
state
for
what
we
term
state
or
federal
offices
that
is
the
governor,
the
lieutenant
governor
or
the
state
assembly,
the
state
senate,
members
in
congress.
these
fees
are
actually
collected
by
the
county
clerks,
who
were
the
ones
who
pass
out
the
papers
to
the
aspiring
candidate.
those
fees
are
then
transmitted
to
the
california
secretary
of
state
and
they
go
into
the
state
treasury
basically.
for
local
candidates,
candidates
within
a
particular
county,
the
county
supervisors,
the
district
attorney,
the
superior
court
judges
--
mr.
henry
g.
ullerich
they
would
go
into
the
general
county
revenues
and
both
the
state
and
county
to
carry
that
through
would
have
some
substantial
election
expense.
probably,
the
counties
have
more
than
the
states
because
they
hire
the
election
officers
out
of
the
precincts
and
print
--
mr.
henry
g.
ullerich
this
is
hard
to
be
specific,
your
honor.
they’re
pointing
to
a
particular
state
budget
for
this
reason.
as
the
funds
collected
by
the
secretary
of
state
for
candidate
filing
fees
are
delivered
from
his
office
into
the
general
fund.
this
commission
has
referred
as
comprised
of
the
secretary
of
state
who
is
really
a
state
election
official,
the
attorney
general
and
one
other
officer
and
each
of
these
three
departments
are
funded
by
appropriation
from
the
general
fund.
so,
you
can’t
earmark
a
particular
follow
the
candidate
filing
fee
system
into
the
general
treasury
and
out
of
the
general
treasury.
but
in
a
sense,
they
go
into
the
general
fund
and
funds
come
out
of
the
general
fund
to
finance
the
operations
of
these
particular
departments.
so,
we
can’t
say
x
number
of
dollars
have
been
appropriated
for
that
commission,
no,
your
honor.
mr.
henry
g.
ullerich
in
the
district
court,
your
honor,
the
matter
moved
very
rapidly.
the
case
or
the
final
date
for
filing
the
declaration
of
candidacy
was
march
10,
1972.
the
complaint
below
was
filed
on
march
3rd,
one
week
before,
where
they
return
to
the
order
to
show
cause
on
march
8th.
our
office
filed
in
effect
a
legal
argument
that
the
contention
--
that
the
claim
failed
to
state
a
claim
upon
which
really
can
be
granted
and
we
cited
legal
authority
and
also
pointed
out
the
matter
of
the
budget
of
the
secretary
of
state,
but
it
was
basically
a
legal
--
mr.
henry
g.
ullerich
well,
i
can't
agree
to
what
showing
would
be
necessary.
i
think
this
argument
which
we
--
mr.
henry
g.
ullerich
right.
mr.
henry
g.
ullerich
no,
we
made
that
argument.
we
filed
in
the
original
records
you
will
see,
we
have
superior
court
cases
in
the
state
in
the
state
--
mr.
henry
g.
ullerich
that
is
correct
your
honor,
and
we
cited
various
cases
around
the
country
that
--
mr.
henry
g.
ullerich
that’s
the
only
thing
that
i
can
think.
there
were
no
evidentiary
testimony
taken
in
the
brief
district
court
proceeding
as
to
perhaps
experience,
only
i
can
think
of
would
be
experience
that
we
have
had
in
cases
where
we
didn’t
have
the
candidate
filing
fees
or
statements
of
politicians
as
to
what
it
takes
to
be
a
serious
candidate.
there
was
no
such
evidence
presented
but
there
was
basically
the
same
legal
argument
presented
that
we
are
making
here.
mr.
henry
g.
ullerich
that
was
the
extent
of
the
injunction,
yes.
mr.
henry
g.
ullerich
but,
that
--
mr.
henry
g.
ullerich
that
was
the
precise
wording
of
--
mr.
henry
g.
ullerich
well,
i’m
not
so
sure
we’re
limited
to
that
because
it
seems
to
me
if
the
statute
is
unconstitutional
as
the
court
predicated
its
decision,
there
was
a
good
argument
that
it
should
be
unconstitutional
as
to
all
--
mr.
henry
g.
ullerich
that’s
what
--
mr.
henry
g.
ullerich
that
was
the
precise
holding
of
the
court
below.
mr.
henry
g.
ullerich
but
no,
that
was
that
the
precise
holding,
but
what
we’re
arguing
and
part
of
the
reason
why
we
perhaps
broadened
it
is
that,
we
are
concerned
with
this
distinction
really
that
the
court
is
making
between
an
indigent
gaining
a
place
on
the
ballot
through
this
means
devised
by
the
court
as
opposed
to
a
hard-working
employed
man
who
perhaps
really
has
political
ambitions
and
skill
and
ability,
but
because
he’s
put
aside
a
minimal
amount
of
money
to
send
his
children
to
college
or
to
care
for
the
necessities
of
life,
and
he
wants
to
run
for
office,
he
is
going
to
have
to
pay
this
$425.00
filling
fee.
mr.
henry
g.
ullerich
i
guess
i
the
terminologies
the
court
would
use
if
they
would
declare
the
statute
unconstitutional
as
applied
to
the
--
mr.
henry
g.
ullerich
that
he
did
not
have
personally
the
money
or
property
to
pay
the
candidate
filing
fees.
mr.
henry
g.
ullerich
it
certainly
does
not
and
let
me
give
another
example
as
to
where
the
decision
below
leads
us.
shortly
after
that
decision
hit
the
newspaper,
we
had
a
letter
from
a
government
teacher
in
high
school,
who
was
really
upset
that
all
of
his
18-year-old
students
could
not
file
for
county
supervisor
because
they
were
glad
to
file
the
pauper’s
affidavit
that
they
did
not
have
sufficient
money
or
property
and
thought
it
would
be
a
good
experience
for
them
to
run
for
that
office.
so,
this
merely
illustrates
as
just
too
where
this
decision
leads
us
as
far
as
crowding
the
ballots
or
frivolous
candidacy
is
concerned.
the
--
mr.
henry
g.
ullerich
california
does
not
at
this
time
have
such
a
system.
the
--
some
of
the
lower
or
the
federal
district
court
decisions
have
intimated
that
such
an
alternative
would
be
desirable.
i
question
as
to
whether
that
is
a
sure
fire
alternative
means
to
the
problems
that
we
express.
it
may
involve
money
to
get
a
lengthy
nominating
petition
either
to
go
out
and
hire
somebody
to
gather
the
signatures,
we
have
this
problem
quite
frequently
in
california
with
our
statewide
initiatives.
you
may
have
to
get
someone
to
go
out
and
stand
in
the
shopping
center
to
collect
the
signatures
and
they
might
want
some
nominal
money
to
do
that,
assuming
you
have
a
lengthy
nomination.
there
maybe
some
charge
by
the
county
clerks
who
will
then
have
to
check
those
signatures
to
see
if
they
are
qualified
signatures.
for
instance,
registered
voters
to
determine
just
who
were
signing
these
petitions.
there
is
some
case
law
for
instance
in
new
mexico,
the
new
mexico
supreme
court
pointed
out
that
they
have
tried
this
and
it
really
wasn’t
very
effective
because
people
have
an
inclination
to
sign
anything
whether
they
really
know
the
person
and
know
whether
is
a
bona
fide
candidate
or
not.
that
also
again,
i
think
is
an
element
of
discrimination
against
the
person
who
for
instance
is
employed
and
doesn’t
have
the
time
to
go
out
and
gather
the
signatures
that
the
unemployed
or
the
indigent
person
might
have.
and
of
course,
it
will
again
open
up
the
argument
that
requiring
a
lengthy
nominating
petition
of
say
3,000
signatures
might
be
a
more
onerous
requirement
than
somebody
who
is
more
affluent
would
be
able
to
simply
right
out
a
check.
so,
i’m
not
sure
that
that’s
a
final
solution.
i
think
its
something
certainly
more
legislatures
including
the
state
of
california
could
seriously
consider,
but
i
don’t
feel
it’s
a
matter
of
constitutional
mandate
that
every
alternative
has
to
be
tried
in
cases
such
as
this.
we
didn’t
--
well,
on
this
point,
too
much
on
the
brief,
but
the
bullock
case
decided
last
term
concluded
in
that
case
that
because
of
the
texas
candidate
filing
fee
system
which
basically
was
a
fee
which
prospective
candidates
couldn’t
know
in
advance,
it
was
a
fee
determined
by
the
county
political
committee
as
an
assessed
cost
of
the
total
cost
of
the
primary
elections.
there
was
some
suggestion
in
that
case
that
the
strict
standard
of
review
may
not
apply
in
those
jurisdictions
which
have
a
more
reasonable
candidate
filing
fee.
i
would
merely
like
to
point
out
at
this
time
that
i
think
this
problem
that
we
have
about
--
if
a
case
involves
an
actual
deprivation
of
voting,
such
as
the
durational
residency
of
those
cases
where
the
state
has
the
burden
of
justifying
the
statutes
by
a
compelling
public
interest,
as
opposed
to
the
old
traditional
rational
basis
test.
it
may
not
be
an
either
or.
we
really
have
a
case
here
that
perhaps
because
there
is
some
association
of
voters
involved.
there
is
obviously
elections
and
some
voting
rights
are
tangently
involved
that
perhaps,
there’s
really
as
a
test
somewhere
in
between
where
there
is
neither
a
presumption
of
constitutionality
nor
such
an
overwhelming
burden
on
the
state
to
justify
the
statutes
and
i
think
we’re
saying
here
that
either
of
these
three
tests,
we
think
we
have
a
sufficient
quantum
of
state
interest
to
justify
these
laws
where
we
feel
quite
confident
that
this
case
really
doesn’t
fall
in
the
same
category
as
those
cases
which
involve
that
actual
deprivation
of
voting
rights
so
that
terribly
stringent
standard
would
be
applicable.
mr.
henry
g.
ullerich
that’s
what
i’m
really
suggesting
that
the
--
mr.
henry
g.
ullerich
a
standard
--
mr.
henry
g.
ullerich
that’s
true.
mr.
henry
g.
ullerich
very
--
just
one
quick
point.
the
amicus
brief
that
was
filed
by
the
american
civil
liberties
union
as
cited
an
intermediate
court
of
appeal
decision
in
california,
the
zapata
case
which
was
decided
last
spring,
i’d
really
want
to
point
out
here
that
the
california
supreme
court
granted
a
hearing
in
that
matter,
and
the
case
was
argued
before
the
california
supreme
court
on
september
5,
1972
and
that
court
has
not
issued
a
decision.
under
california
law,
when
the
california
supreme
court
grants
a
hearing,
the
intermediate
court
of
appeal
opinion
is
as
dead
as
anything
can
be
and
i
can
only
guess
that
perhaps
our
state
supreme
court
is
aware
of
this
case
and
is
deferring
a
final
judgment
in
the
zapata
case.
so,
that
case
is
no
authority.
mr.
henry
g.
ullerich
i
really
don’t
mean
the
second
guess
that
court.
in
conclusion,
i
really
want
to
say
that
i
think
a
substantial
but
a
reasonable
candidate
filing
fee
is
necessary
to
further
the
state
interest
that
have
been
adverted
to
in
many
judicial
decisions.
there
maybe
other
means
to
accomplish
those
same
goals,
but
we
have
practical
history
in
california
for
over
60
years
and
many
other
states
have
fees
that
are
in
somewhat
the
same
range,
they
vary
and
it
where
from
1%
up
to
5%
or
6%,
but
i
believe,
there’s
other
means
and
matters
for
legislative
consideration.
we
think
that
totality
of
a
state
interest
that
we
describe
do
justify
our
candidate
filing
fees
under
the
equal
protection
clause.
thank
you.
mr.
henry
g.
ullerich
only
on
the
question
of
boddie
versus
connecticut
which
came
up
and
as
i
recall,
that
was
the
case
where
the
fundamental
relationship
of
divorce,
certain
people
would
not
have
to
pay
the
court
filing
fees
in
order
to
get
access
to
the
court.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
state
interest
in
that
case
was
merely
the
loss
of
a
very
nominal
amount
of
revenue
to
process
the
actual
papers.
i
think
the
state
interests
are
substantially
different
in
this
case
because
of
the
ballot
control,
fragmentation
of
vote
and
so
forth.
it's
really
not
just
a
matter
of
the
state
as
only
loosing
the
$425.00
fee,
it’s
the
matter
of
the
effective
control
of
the
ballot.
mr.
henry
g.
ullerich
that’s
right
your
honor.
i
have
nothing
further.
mr.
henry
g.
ullerich
well,
i
think
that
would
be
true
if
you
talk
about
the
$10.00
or
$15.00
fee,
your
honor.
but
i
think
if
you’re
talking
about
or
what
we
term
or
been
judicially
declared
--
mr.
henry
g.
ullerich
well,
what
i
was
saying
is
if
we
are
going
to
talking
about
four
or
$500.00,
i
think
the
strip
teaser
or
the
car
salesman
for
instance,
are
going
to
think
twice
before
they
use
that
as
a
mode
of
advertisement
or
public
relationship,
even
if
they
have
the
money
to
pay.
it
has
to
be
large
enough
to
discourage
that
type
of
candidacy.
i
think
four
or
$500.00
is.
mr.
henry
g.
ullerich
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
constitutionality
of
the
california
candidate
filing
fee
system
is
the
subject
of
this
direct
appeal
on
the
judgment
of
a
three-judge
federal
district
court,
granting
a
preliminary
injunction
against
the
california
secretary
of
state
and
the
various
county
clerks
in
the
state
of
california.
the
injunction
in
affect
mandated
the
california
secretary
of
state
to
accept
declarations
of
candidacy
in
the
last
primary
election
without
payment
of
the
statutory
candidate
filing
fee
of
1%
of
the
annual
salary
of
the
office
sought.
at
least
as
to
those
members
of
the
class
of
the
plaintiff
below
who
were
willing
to
file
an
affidavit
with
the
county
clerk
that
they
had
insufficient
money
or
property
to
personally
pay
the
candidate
filing
fee.
the
issues
presented
by
this
appeal
from
the
judgment
granting
a
preliminary
injunction
is,
does
california
elections
code,
section
6552,
which
imposes
the
statutory
filing
fee
violate
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
united
states
constitution.
subsidiary
issue
is
what
is
the
appropriate
standard
of
review
when
this
statute
is
challenged
in
the
judicial
proceeding.
an
additional
issue
is
whether
this
case
is
controlled
by
the
decision
last
term
in
bullock
versus
carter,
405
u.s.
134
and
the
final
issue
is
if
a
less
stringent
standard
of
review
is
applicable
herein,
other
than
the
standard
imposed
in
the
bullock
case,
does
the
california
candidate
filing
fee
have
a
rational
basis
which
would
be
sustained
under
the
traditional
rational
basis
test
under
the
equal
protection
clause?
factually,
california
requires
a
party
primary
election
in
even
numbered
years
preceding
the
general
election.
for
the
name
of
a
candidate
to
appear
on
the
primary
ballot
in
june
of
even
numbered
years,
the
candidate
must
obtain
declaration
of
candidacy
forms
from
the
county
clerk
and
at
that
time,
he
is
required
to
pay
a
candidate
filing
fee.
there
is
no
method
for
a
candidate’s
name
to
appear
on
the
primary
ballot
without
paying
the
candidate
filing
fee.
basically
for
state
or
federal
office,
that
fee
is
either
1%
or
2%
of
the
annual
salary
of
the
office.
mr.
henry
g.
ullerich
the
answer
to
that
i
believe,
your
honor,
is
that
the
--
a
particular
flat
fee
over
the
years
with
the
inflation
that
we
have
would
tend
to
be
perhaps
minimal
at
one
period
of
time
and
then
become
rather
excessive
in
other
periods
of
inflation
or
depression
periods.
i
think
the
annual
salary,
i
mean,
the
basis
the
annual
salary
is
pegged
in
more
to
the
actual
benefits
at
the
end
of
a
rainbow,
if
you
will,
and
as
the
salary
changes,
the
fee
also
changes
somewhat.
i
think
also,
there
is
a
consideration
of
rather
than
being
pegged
at
a
very
minimal
fee
of
say,
as
was
suggested
in
one
case
of
$10.00
or
$15.00
to
handle
the
actual
cost
of
handling
the
papers
would
not
achieve
the
state
objective
that
these
candidate
filing
fees
are
designed
achieve,
that
is
to
avoid
overcrowding
of
the
ballots
fragmentation
of
votes
or
discouraging
frivolous
candidates.
the
fee
must
be
something
more
than
a
merely
nominal
fee
to
accomplish
that
purpose.
mr.
henry
g.
ullerich
that
is
true,
your
honor.
as
you’ll
see
from
our
statutes
that
are
reported
in
our
brief
that
these
would
vary
from
no
fee
at
all,
if
there
is
really
no
compensation
for
the
office
to
1%
or
2%,
and
the
distinction
for
the
1%
or
2%
that
seems
to
be
apparent
in
the
statute
is
that
let's
say
statewide
office,
for
instance
the
united
state
senate
or
a
governor
or
lieutenant
governor
and
so
forth,
there
would
be
some
activity
on
the
part
of
58
county
clerks
or
county
registrars
or
voters
in
regard
to
that
particular
candidate
whereas
if
you’re
running
from
a
particular
district
such
a
member
of
congress
or
state
assembly
or
state
senator,
there
is
usually
only
one
particular
county
or
a
limited
district
that
would
be
involved
in
processing
those
papers.
mr.
henry
g.
ullerich
that
would
be
true,
your
honor.
i
think
we
have
--
we
are
not
riding
on
our
clean
slate
anymore
following
that
language
in
bullock.
as
we
pointed
out
in
our
brief
down
in
new
mexico,
a
federal
district
court
invalidated
the
6%
of
the
annual
salary
filing
fee
for
candidates
for
the
united
state
senate.
following
that
federal
district
court
ruling,
there
were
40
candidates
who
filed
for
the
united
state
senate
and
appeared
on
that
ballot.
only
four
of
which
paid
the
candidate
filing
fee.
we
haven't
had
a
real
experience
in
california
because
the
decision
below
was
rendered
on
march
9,
1972.
march
10th
was
the
cutoff
date
for
candidates
to
get
their
declarations
of
candidacy
and
their
sponsor
certificates
into
the
county
clerk.
so
with
the
limited
publicity
and
the
limited
time,
we
haven't
had
the
full
experience.
but
if
we
can
extrapolate
a
little
bit
from
new
mexico
to
take,
say
the
city
of
los
angeles,
if
one
candidate
for
every
50,000
people
would
appear
on
the
ballot,
we
would
have
like
50
candidates
running
for
mayor
of
the
city
of
the
los
angeles,
and
certainly
there
has
to
be
something,
some
gauge
to
make
sure
that
candidates
have
a
modicum
of
support
and
a
sufficient
backing
to
really
be
termed
a
serious
candidate.
mr.
henry
g.
ullerich
and
one
--
mr.
henry
g.
ullerich
well,
i
think
the
reasons
we
have
to
give
for
that
is
really
by
history
of
a
candidate
filing
fee,
your
honor
is
that,
the
part
of
it,
the
--
these
candidate
filing
fees
came
into
avoid
this
overcrowding.
really
the
theory
was
to
give
people
a
more
rational
choice
by
limiting
their
choice
somewhat.
if
you
have
too
many
candidates,
you
really
couldn’t
understand
all
of
the
issues
in
the
candidate.
you
couldn’t
really
make
a
rational
decision
and
secondly,
we
have
certain
limitations
like
in
california
--
mr.
henry
g.
ullerich
yes.
well,
what
i’m
saying
also
was
in
58
counties
in
california
--
mr.
henry
g.
ullerich
well,
this
is
on
the
gross.
mr.
henry
g.
ullerich
for
instance,
for
a
member
of
congress
which
is
42,500,
the
fee
would
be
$425.00,
and
--
mr.
henry
g.
ullerich
well,
i’m
saying
really
that
the
personal
well
for
lack
of
wealth
of
the
individual
candidate
is
really
not
the
critical
issue
is
that,
we
all
know
campaigns
cost
a
lot
of
money
that
mayor
may
not
be
a
good
thing
but
campaign’s
cost
a
lot
of
money.
i
think
at
the
last
election,
the
newspapers
were
talking
about
$400
million
from
contributions
to
candidate.
and
what
i’m
saying
is
if
it
takes
candidates
say
spend
$50,000
or
a
$100,000.00
to
run
to
be
a
member
in
congress,
if
you
have
sufficient
support
in
your
community
or
your
interest
group
to
be
a
serious
candidate
for
that
position
and
there’s
nothing
in
the
law
that
say
that
the
$425.00
can’t
come
from
contributions
of
your
supporters.
is
that
really
that
that
is
a
fee
that
just
substantial
enough
to
really
make
sure
that
you’re
going
to
make
a
serious
run
for
this
office.
mr.
henry
g.
ullerich
no,
i’m
saying
that
a
poor
man
has
a
good
chance
of
running.
if
he
goes
out
--
we
have
something
different
--
mr.
henry
g.
ullerich
poor
man
without
a
rich
friend?
he
would
have
--
mr.
henry
g.
ullerich
he
would
have
to
--
if
he
wants
to
run
--
run
in
the
spring
of
1974
for
instance
he
knows
what
our
statutory
fee
is
and
has
been
for
good
many
years.
he
knows
a
long
way
in
advance
as
to
how
much
money
he
is
going
to
have
to
gather
from
contributions,
from
friends,
relatives
and
supporters
to
really
conduct
a
serious
campaign.
and
one
facet
of
that,
that
he
is
going
to
have
to
consider
is
he
at
least
going
to
have
to
raise
the
filing
fee
before
his
name
is
going
to
appear
in
the
ballot.
mr.
henry
g.
ullerich
we,
that
as
an
example,
yes
your
honor.
we’re
saying
that
--
it
was
part
of
our
point
that
the
personal
wealth
or
the
lack
of
property
of
the
individual
should
really
not
be
that
significant.
if
he’s
meeting
in
his
locality,
if
he’s
gearing
up
to
run
for
the
office,
he
really
can
go
around
and
collect
the
dollar
or
two
from
his
supporters
and
if
he’s
really
a
serious
candidate,
that
should
not
be
an
insurmountable
burden
to
keep
him
off
the
ballot.
mr.
henry
g.
ullerich
yes
your
honor,
we
agree
with
that,
is
that
this
is
merely
a
threshold
requirement
really
to
test
his
seriousness
as
to
whether
he
has
a
sufficient
backing
in
the
community
to
take
a
place
on
the
ballot
and
we
have
to
consider
also,
on
with
the
various
types
of
machines.
we
don’t
have
one
standard
type
of
machine
in
california.
some
counties
have
voting
machines,
some
counties
have
automatic-type
no
books
that
open
up
and
i
think
the
number
of
candidates
and
issues
appear
on
the
ballot
is
a
serious
consideration
nowadays.
you
may
have
seen
the
one
we
have
the
primary
in
california
in
1972,
due
to
the
length
of
time,
it
was
taking
people
to
vote
in
san
francisco
the
polls
there
remained
open
an
additional
three
hours
to
allow
people
to
vote.
i
think
that
this
--
mr.
henry
g.
ullerich
that
was
one
of
considerations,
yes.
the
length
of
--
mr.
henry
g.
ullerich
well
as
i
said,
the
decision
in
the
case
was
on
march
9,
1972
and
there
was
only
a
period
of
24
hours
for
people
to
learn
about
the
decision.
the
members
of
the
class
represent
by
appellee
and
go
out
and
obtain
the
papers
from
the
county
clerk,
go
out
and
get
the
required
number
of
signatures
from
their
supporters
and
get
back
into
the
county
clerks.
so,
we
really
haven't
had
a
real
live
experience
of
it.
mr.
henry
g.
ullerich
that’s
true
your
honor.
mr.
henry
g.
ullerich
that
would
be
inclined
to
agree
with
that
and
i
also
would
add
that
the
way
that
our
election
system
has
been
operating
for
a
substantial
period
of
time,
you
really
can’t
separate
the
two
to
determine
a
serious
candidate.
perhaps,
if
we
had
some
other
method
or
campaign
financing
we
wouldn’t
have
that
problem,
but
they
way
that
was
setup
at
the
present
time,
money
and
serious
candidacy
appear
to
go
hand-in-hand.
mr.
henry
g.
ullerich
in
california,
there
is
a
division
between
the
counties
and
the
state
for
what
we
term
state
or
federal
offices
that
is
the
governor,
the
lieutenant
governor
or
the
state
assembly,
the
state
senate,
members
in
congress.
these
fees
are
actually
collected
by
the
county
clerks,
who
were
the
ones
who
pass
out
the
papers
to
the
aspiring
candidate.
those
fees
are
then
transmitted
to
the
california
secretary
of
state
and
they
go
into
the
state
treasury
basically.
for
local
candidates,
candidates
within
a
particular
county,
the
county
supervisors,
the
district
attorney,
the
superior
court
judges
--
mr.
henry
g.
ullerich
they
would
go
into
the
general
county
revenues
and
both
the
state
and
county
to
carry
that
through
would
have
some
substantial
election
expense.
probably,
the
counties
have
more
than
the
states
because
they
hire
the
election
officers
out
of
the
precincts
and
print
--
mr.
henry
g.
ullerich
this
is
hard
to
be
specific,
your
honor.
they’re
pointing
to
a
particular
state
budget
for
this
reason.
as
the
funds
collected
by
the
secretary
of
state
for
candidate
filing
fees
are
delivered
from
his
office
into
the
general
fund.
this
commission
has
referred
as
comprised
of
the
secretary
of
state
who
is
really
a
state
election
official,
the
attorney
general
and
one
other
officer
and
each
of
these
three
departments
are
funded
by
appropriation
from
the
general
fund.
so,
you
can’t
earmark
a
particular
follow
the
candidate
filing
fee
system
into
the
general
treasury
and
out
of
the
general
treasury.
but
in
a
sense,
they
go
into
the
general
fund
and
funds
come
out
of
the
general
fund
to
finance
the
operations
of
these
particular
departments.
so,
we
can’t
say
x
number
of
dollars
have
been
appropriated
for
that
commission,
no,
your
honor.
mr.
henry
g.
ullerich
in
the
district
court,
your
honor,
the
matter
moved
very
rapidly.
the
case
or
the
final
date
for
filing
the
declaration
of
candidacy
was
march
10,
1972.
the
complaint
below
was
filed
on
march
3rd,
one
week
before,
where
they
return
to
the
order
to
show
cause
on
march
8th.
our
office
filed
in
effect
a
legal
argument
that
the
contention
--
that
the
claim
failed
to
state
a
claim
upon
which
really
can
be
granted
and
we
cited
legal
authority
and
also
pointed
out
the
matter
of
the
budget
of
the
secretary
of
state,
but
it
was
basically
a
legal
--
mr.
henry
g.
ullerich
well,
i
can't
agree
to
what
showing
would
be
necessary.
i
think
this
argument
which
we
--
mr.
henry
g.
ullerich
right.
mr.
henry
g.
ullerich
no,
we
made
that
argument.
we
filed
in
the
original
records
you
will
see,
we
have
superior
court
cases
in
the
state
in
the
state
--
mr.
henry
g.
ullerich
that
is
correct
your
honor,
and
we
cited
various
cases
around
the
country
that
--
mr.
henry
g.
ullerich
that’s
the
only
thing
that
i
can
think.
there
were
no
evidentiary
testimony
taken
in
the
brief
district
court
proceeding
as
to
perhaps
experience,
only
i
can
think
of
would
be
experience
that
we
have
had
in
cases
where
we
didn’t
have
the
candidate
filing
fees
or
statements
of
politicians
as
to
what
it
takes
to
be
a
serious
candidate.
there
was
no
such
evidence
presented
but
there
was
basically
the
same
legal
argument
presented
that
we
are
making
here.
mr.
henry
g.
ullerich
that
was
the
extent
of
the
injunction,
yes.
mr.
henry
g.
ullerich
but,
that
--
mr.
henry
g.
ullerich
that
was
the
precise
wording
of
--
mr.
henry
g.
ullerich
well,
i’m
not
so
sure
we’re
limited
to
that
because
it
seems
to
me
if
the
statute
is
unconstitutional
as
the
court
predicated
its
decision,
there
was
a
good
argument
that
it
should
be
unconstitutional
as
to
all
--
mr.
henry
g.
ullerich
that’s
what
--
mr.
henry
g.
ullerich
that
was
the
precise
holding
of
the
court
below.
mr.
henry
g.
ullerich
but
no,
that
was
that
the
precise
holding,
but
what
we’re
arguing
and
part
of
the
reason
why
we
perhaps
broadened
it
is
that,
we
are
concerned
with
this
distinction
really
that
the
court
is
making
between
an
indigent
gaining
a
place
on
the
ballot
through
this
means
devised
by
the
court
as
opposed
to
a
hard-working
employed
man
who
perhaps
really
has
political
ambitions
and
skill
and
ability,
but
because
he’s
put
aside
a
minimal
amount
of
money
to
send
his
children
to
college
or
to
care
for
the
necessities
of
life,
and
he
wants
to
run
for
office,
he
is
going
to
have
to
pay
this
$425.00
filling
fee.
mr.
henry
g.
ullerich
i
guess
i
the
terminologies
the
court
would
use
if
they
would
declare
the
statute
unconstitutional
as
applied
to
the
--
mr.
henry
g.
ullerich
that
he
did
not
have
personally
the
money
or
property
to
pay
the
candidate
filing
fees.
mr.
henry
g.
ullerich
it
certainly
does
not
and
let
me
give
another
example
as
to
where
the
decision
below
leads
us.
shortly
after
that
decision
hit
the
newspaper,
we
had
a
letter
from
a
government
teacher
in
high
school,
who
was
really
upset
that
all
of
his
18-year-old
students
could
not
file
for
county
supervisor
because
they
were
glad
to
file
the
pauper’s
affidavit
that
they
did
not
have
sufficient
money
or
property
and
thought
it
would
be
a
good
experience
for
them
to
run
for
that
office.
so,
this
merely
illustrates
as
just
too
where
this
decision
leads
us
as
far
as
crowding
the
ballots
or
frivolous
candidacy
is
concerned.
the
--
mr.
henry
g.
ullerich
california
does
not
at
this
time
have
such
a
system.
the
--
some
of
the
lower
or
the
federal
district
court
decisions
have
intimated
that
such
an
alternative
would
be
desirable.
i
question
as
to
whether
that
is
a
sure
fire
alternative
means
to
the
problems
that
we
express.
it
may
involve
money
to
get
a
lengthy
nominating
petition
either
to
go
out
and
hire
somebody
to
gather
the
signatures,
we
have
this
problem
quite
frequently
in
california
with
our
statewide
initiatives.
you
may
have
to
get
someone
to
go
out
and
stand
in
the
shopping
center
to
collect
the
signatures
and
they
might
want
some
nominal
money
to
do
that,
assuming
you
have
a
lengthy
nomination.
there
maybe
some
charge
by
the
county
clerks
who
will
then
have
to
check
those
signatures
to
see
if
they
are
qualified
signatures.
for
instance,
registered
voters
to
determine
just
who
were
signing
these
petitions.
there
is
some
case
law
for
instance
in
new
mexico,
the
new
mexico
supreme
court
pointed
out
that
they
have
tried
this
and
it
really
wasn’t
very
effective
because
people
have
an
inclination
to
sign
anything
whether
they
really
know
the
person
and
know
whether
is
a
bona
fide
candidate
or
not.
that
also
again,
i
think
is
an
element
of
discrimination
against
the
person
who
for
instance
is
employed
and
doesn’t
have
the
time
to
go
out
and
gather
the
signatures
that
the
unemployed
or
the
indigent
person
might
have.
and
of
course,
it
will
again
open
up
the
argument
that
requiring
a
lengthy
nominating
petition
of
say
3,000
signatures
might
be
a
more
onerous
requirement
than
somebody
who
is
more
affluent
would
be
able
to
simply
right
out
a
check.
so,
i’m
not
sure
that
that’s
a
final
solution.
i
think
its
something
certainly
more
legislatures
including
the
state
of
california
could
seriously
consider,
but
i
don’t
feel
it’s
a
matter
of
constitutional
mandate
that
every
alternative
has
to
be
tried
in
cases
such
as
this.
we
didn’t
--
well,
on
this
point,
too
much
on
the
brief,
but
the
bullock
case
decided
last
term
concluded
in
that
case
that
because
of
the
texas
candidate
filing
fee
system
which
basically
was
a
fee
which
prospective
candidates
couldn’t
know
in
advance,
it
was
a
fee
determined
by
the
county
political
committee
as
an
assessed
cost
of
the
total
cost
of
the
primary
elections.
there
was
some
suggestion
in
that
case
that
the
strict
standard
of
review
may
not
apply
in
those
jurisdictions
which
have
a
more
reasonable
candidate
filing
fee.
i
would
merely
like
to
point
out
at
this
time
that
i
think
this
problem
that
we
have
about
--
if
a
case
involves
an
actual
deprivation
of
voting,
such
as
the
durational
residency
of
those
cases
where
the
state
has
the
burden
of
justifying
the
statutes
by
a
compelling
public
interest,
as
opposed
to
the
old
traditional
rational
basis
test.
it
may
not
be
an
either
or.
we
really
have
a
case
here
that
perhaps
because
there
is
some
association
of
voters
involved.
there
is
obviously
elections
and
some
voting
rights
are
tangently
involved
that
perhaps,
there’s
really
as
a
test
somewhere
in
between
where
there
is
neither
a
presumption
of
constitutionality
nor
such
an
overwhelming
burden
on
the
state
to
justify
the
statutes
and
i
think
we’re
saying
here
that
either
of
these
three
tests,
we
think
we
have
a
sufficient
quantum
of
state
interest
to
justify
these
laws
where
we
feel
quite
confident
that
this
case
really
doesn’t
fall
in
the
same
category
as
those
cases
which
involve
that
actual
deprivation
of
voting
rights
so
that
terribly
stringent
standard
would
be
applicable.
mr.
henry
g.
ullerich
that’s
what
i’m
really
suggesting
that
the
--
mr.
henry
g.
ullerich
a
standard
--
mr.
henry
g.
ullerich
that’s
true.
mr.
henry
g.
ullerich
very
--
just
one
quick
point.
the
amicus
brief
that
was
filed
by
the
american
civil
liberties
union
as
cited
an
intermediate
court
of
appeal
decision
in
california,
the
zapata
case
which
was
decided
last
spring,
i’d
really
want
to
point
out
here
that
the
california
supreme
court
granted
a
hearing
in
that
matter,
and
the
case
was
argued
before
the
california
supreme
court
on
september
5,
1972
and
that
court
has
not
issued
a
decision.
under
california
law,
when
the
california
supreme
court
grants
a
hearing,
the
intermediate
court
of
appeal
opinion
is
as
dead
as
anything
can
be
and
i
can
only
guess
that
perhaps
our
state
supreme
court
is
aware
of
this
case
and
is
deferring
a
final
judgment
in
the
zapata
case.
so,
that
case
is
no
authority.
mr.
henry
g.
ullerich
i
really
don’t
mean
the
second
guess
that
court.
in
conclusion,
i
really
want
to
say
that
i
think
a
substantial
but
a
reasonable
candidate
filing
fee
is
necessary
to
further
the
state
interest
that
have
been
adverted
to
in
many
judicial
decisions.
there
maybe
other
means
to
accomplish
those
same
goals,
but
we
have
practical
history
in
california
for
over
60
years
and
many
other
states
have
fees
that
are
in
somewhat
the
same
range,
they
vary
and
it
where
from
1%
up
to
5%
or
6%,
but
i
believe,
there’s
other
means
and
matters
for
legislative
consideration.
we
think
that
totality
of
a
state
interest
that
we
describe
do
justify
our
candidate
filing
fees
under
the
equal
protection
clause.
thank
you.
mr.
henry
g.
ullerich
only
on
the
question
of
boddie
versus
connecticut
which
came
up
and
as
i
recall,
that
was
the
case
where
the
fundamental
relationship
of
divorce,
certain
people
would
not
have
to
pay
the
court
filing
fees
in
order
to
get
access
to
the
court.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
state
interest
in
that
case
was
merely
the
loss
of
a
very
nominal
amount
of
revenue
to
process
the
actual
papers.
i
think
the
state
interests
are
substantially
different
in
this
case
because
of
the
ballot
control,
fragmentation
of
vote
and
so
forth.
it's
really
not
just
a
matter
of
the
state
as
only
loosing
the
$425.00
fee,
it’s
the
matter
of
the
effective
control
of
the
ballot.
mr.
henry
g.
ullerich
that’s
right
your
honor.
i
have
nothing
further.
mr.
henry
g.
ullerich
well,
i
think
that
would
be
true
if
you
talk
about
the
$10.00
or
$15.00
fee,
your
honor.
but
i
think
if
you’re
talking
about
or
what
we
term
or
been
judicially
declared
--
mr.
henry
g.
ullerich
well,
what
i
was
saying
is
if
we
are
going
to
talking
about
four
or
$500.00,
i
think
the
strip
teaser
or
the
car
salesman
for
instance,
are
going
to
think
twice
before
they
use
that
as
a
mode
of
advertisement
or
public
relationship,
even
if
they
have
the
money
