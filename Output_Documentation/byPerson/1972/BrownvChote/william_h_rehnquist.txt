h.
rehnquist
well,
i
take
it
if
you
can’t
raise
$425.00
and
plans
to
run
for
congress,
his
candidacy
is
pretty
well
fore
doomed,
regardless
of
whether
there
is
a
filing
fee
or
not.
if
he
can’t
raise
some
money
to
conduct
a
campaign,
he
isn't
a
serious
candidate
even
though
there
were
no
filing
fee.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
elman,
could
we
treat
it
even
more
narrowly
than
justice
stewart
has
indicated
and
say
simply
that
simply
this
was
a
preliminary
injunction
that
bullock
afforded
a
reasonable
argument
for
the
trial
court
to
grant
preliminary
relief
and
not
even
pass
on
the
constitutionality
in
the
final
sense
of
the
california
system,
even
as
applied
to
indigents
here?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist

if
you
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
elman,
if
you
regard
the
answer
of
the
chief
justice’s
question
as
an
open
one,
that
is
that
perhaps
ultimately
it
would
follow
that
not
only
money
filing
fee
would
be
struck
down,
but
the
petition
signature
collecting
requirement
would
be
struck
down
then
in
effect,
the
state
could
do
nothing
constitutionally
to
prevent
every
high
school
civic
students
from
running
for
supervisor
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
would
you
concede
for
the
purpose
of
your
argument
here
that
the
state
does
have
a
legitimate
interest
in
somehow
minimizing
the
choice
the
electors
have
to
make
from
among
the
potential
candidates
for
an
office
that
you
wouldn’t
want
60
candidates
for
county
supervisor
on
a
primary
ballot?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
many
votes
did
he
get?
