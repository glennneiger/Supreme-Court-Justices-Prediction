justice
potter
stewart
but
then
also
as
i
understand
your
argument,
you
first
quote
the
language
in
bullock,
recognizing
that
the
state
has
a
legitimate
interest
in
regulating
the
number
of
candidates
on
the
ballot
and
preventing
clogging
of
its
election
machinery
by
frivolous
candidates.
and
your
argument
is
that
a
$10.00
or
$15.00
fee
wouldn’t
keep
a
candidate
for
senator
or
governor
for
a
wholly
frivolous,
a
non-serious
one
off
the
ballot.
you
need
a
higher
figure
to
accomplish
the
state
purpose
whereas
a
$10.00
or
$15.00
fee
probably
would
keep
off
frivolous
candidate
for
dog
catcher,
isn’t
right?
justice
potter
stewart
general
ullerich,
something
rather
fundamentally
in
this
case
causes
me
concern.
it’s
argued
as
i
understand
it
on
both
the
briefs
and
basically
in
your
oral
argument
here
as
though
the
whole
filing
fee
scheme
had
bee
struck
down
as
violate
of
the
equal
protection
clause
and
yet
i
understand
that
all
that
the
court
held
was
that
an
indigent,
an
indigent
or
at
least
a
functional
indigent,
a
person
who
could
not
afford
personally
to
pay
this
fees
could
not
be
required
to
pay
them.
isn’t
that
the
extent
of
the
holding
of
the
court?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
that’s
all
then
we’re
dealing
with,
isn’t
it?
justice
potter
stewart
we’re
not
in
other
words,
analogizing
it
to
griffin
against
illinois.
it’s
not
a
case
where
the
whole
filing
fee
requirement
of
a
transcript
for
it
to
be
paid
for
is
struck
down.
but
just
that
it
cannot
be
constitutionally
applied
to
a
person
who
is
absolutely
indigent
or
at
least,
so
absolutely
that
he
can't
afford
to
pay
these
rather
small
fees,
isn’t
that
all
in
this
court?
justice
potter
stewart
well
then
that’s
all
we’re
dealing
with,
isn’t
it?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
maybe
there
might
be
a
good
argument
at
some
other
case,
but
in
this
case,
isn’t
that
all
that
this
court
held?
it’s
like
boddie
against
connecticut,
didn’t
strike
down
filing
fees
for
people
who
want
to
get
divorces,
but
it
just
said
they
could
not
be
assessed
against
somebody
who
is
absolutely
unable
to
pay
them.
justice
potter
stewart
and
file
an
affidavit
to
that
effect?
justice
potter
stewart
but,
it’s
argued
here
as
though
the
holding
was
something
quite
different,
i
think.
justice
potter
stewart
and
all
that
concern
goes
through
all
of
the
american
society,
hospitalization
and
everything
else,
but
am
i
wrong
and
thinking
that
the
precise
holding
of
this
court
in
this
case
was
not
that
the
filing
fees
violate
the
equal
protection
clause,
but
simply
that
it
would
violate
the
equal
protection
clause
to
require
an
indigent
to
pay
them,
am
i
mistaken
about
that?
justice
potter
stewart
to
somebody
who
filed
an
affidavit
that
he
could
not
pay
them?
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
you
think
there
maybe
as
many
as
three
tests,
do
you?
justice
potter
stewart
how
about
the
--
do
you
think
there
might
be
more
than
that?
justice
potter
stewart
there
could
be
an
infinite
number
of
tests,
i
suppose
couldn't
there?
justice
potter
stewart
depending
upon
which
test
--
if
the
majority
of
the
court
was
--
and
decided
to
invalidate
a
state
law,
they
would
annunciate
the
test
that
was
required
to
do
so.
justice
potter
stewart
in
that
case
mr.
elman,
am
i
not
--
justice
potter
stewart
am
i
correct
in
recalling
that
in
the
bullock
case,
the
court
invalidated
the
whole
system
of
so-called
filing
fees.
and
by
contrast
in
this
case,
your
brother
has
confirmed
by
understanding
that
in
this
case,
all
that
was
held
was
it
indigents
could
not
be
compelled
to
pay
them.
so,
isn’t
this
in
more
bullock
like
case,
isn’t
this
more
a
boddie
like
case,
boddie
against
connecticut?
justice
potter
stewart
but
what
is
the
holding
in
the
bullock
case?
justice
potter
stewart
what
was
the
ultimate
holding
in
the
bullock
case?
justice
potter
stewart
that
scheme
was
invalid,
wouldn’t
it?
justice
potter
stewart
here,
there’s
not
such
holding?
it's
just
a
holding
that
indigents
can’t
be
compel
to
pay
the
fees?
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
and
the
injunction
--
justice
potter
stewart
is
matter
only
to
those
who
file
affidavits
of
--
they
actually
pay,
isn’t
it?
justice
potter
stewart
was
it?
justice
potter
stewart
i
didn’t
know
--
justice
potter
stewart
well,
may
be
i
quite
misunderstood
the
terms
of
that
preliminary
injunction,
but
i
had
understood
that
the
way
i
indicated
it,
that
would
--
if
i’m
correct
in
that,
then
it
would
be
equally
applicable
if
the
favor
just
$1.00
a
candidate
across
the
board.
if
a
person
files
an
affidavit,
then,
i’m
sorry,
i
haven’t
got
a
dollar,
i’m
an
indigent,
i
can’t
pay
it.
even
though
that
were
the
fee,
then
under
a
reasoning
of
boddie,
if
it’s
applicable
to
this
situation
then,
he
could
not
be
required
to
pay
it.
justice
potter
stewart
and
why
do
i
--
justice
potter
stewart
if
a
fee
can
be
justified
as
against
those
who
can
afford
to
pay
the
fee,
it’s
nonetheless
might
violate
equal
protection
to
charge
it
against
somebody
who
could
not
possibly
comply
with
the
law
because
he
is
absolutely
indigent,
wouldn’t
it?
even
though
court
fees
are
presumably
justified
and
we
held
in
boddie
that
they
couldn’t
be
assessed
against
somebody
who
absolutely
was
unable
to
pay
them?
justice
potter
stewart
but
it
doesn’t
mean
that
court
fees
are
not
wholly
justified?
justice
potter
stewart
what
else
it
would
do?
justice
potter
stewart
what
would
a
way
of
doing
it
be?
justice
potter
stewart
in
janise.
justice
potter
stewart
well
--
justice
potter
stewart
what
you
just
suggested
and
i
just
said
it
was
a
pretty
good
valid
suggestion.
justice
potter
stewart
if
a
man
just
wanted
to
advertise
his
automobile
business
for
example
may
have
plenty
of
money,
is
that
your
point?
justice
potter
stewart
he
may
not
be
a
fraudulent
candidate,
but
his
purpose
in
getting
on
a
ballot
and
running
is
to
advertise
his
used
car
business?
justice
potter
stewart
did
anybody
know
what
his
slogan
was?
justice
potter
stewart
people
voted
for
him?
justice
potter
stewart
i
don’t
know
how
he
publicize
that
slogan,
how
anybody
knew
about
it?
justice
potter
stewart
that
would
cost
him
money
from
an
economist's
point
of
view?
justice
potter
stewart
wouldn’t
you
or
would
you
concede
mr.
elman
that
the
statute
of
california
like
any
statute
of
any
state
comes
to
this
court
or
to
any
court
with
a
presumption
that
it
is
constitutional
valid?
justice
potter
stewart
is
presumptively
invalid?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
once
you
say
that
--
justice
potter
stewart
do
you
know
of
any
opinion
which
uses
the
phrase
“heavy
burden
of
justification”
or
“close
judicial
scrutiny”
or
“compelling
state
interest.”
any
of
those
three
phrases,
any
opinion
of
this
court
in
which
a
state
court,
in
which
the
decision
is
other
than
to
hold
the
statute
invalid?
justice
potter
stewart
that
the
burden
is
been
stated.
justice
potter
stewart
where’s
the
first
amendment
right
here?
justice
potter
stewart
right
to
vote?
justice
potter
stewart
well
no,
but
if
you
ever
had
minor
against
happersett,
it
did
hold
if
there
is
no
constitutional
right
to
vote
and
if
that
hadn’t
been
true,
there
would
have
been
no
need
to
have
a
nineteenth
amendment
to
the
constitution
giving
woman
the
right
to
vote,
you’d
agree
with
that,
wouldn’t
you?
justice
potter
stewart
you
familiar
of
mr.
justice
frankfurter's,
one
of
his
favorite
law
review
articles,
other
than
those
which
he
himself
been
the
author.[laughter
attempt]
was
a
famous
one
in
the
harvard
law
review
that
he
once
told
me
had
required
all
his
--
first
to
read
when
it
first
came,
wasn’t
by
singer
in
the
harvard
law
review?
justice
potter
stewart
having
to
do
with
the
presumption
of
validity
of
any
state
--
justice
potter
stewart
can
you
give
me
a
citation
off
hand?
it
was
writing
for
then
--
justice
potter
stewart
it's
about
37?
justice
potter
stewart
thank
you.
justice
potter
stewart
also
that
case
was
decided
under
a
different
provision
of
the
constitution,
other
than
one
that's
here.
justice
potter
stewart
but
then
also
