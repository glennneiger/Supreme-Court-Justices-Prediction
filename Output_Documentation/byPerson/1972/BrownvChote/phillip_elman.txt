mr.
phillip
elman
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
essence
of
this
case
as
we
see
it,
is
that
the
state
of
california
bars
a
citizen
from
running
for
congress
or
for
almost
every
other
elective
public
office
unless
he
first
pays
to
the
state,
a
substantial
sum
of
money
described,
perhaps
euphemistically,
as
a
filing
fee
and
chief
justice’s
opinion
for
the
court
last
term
in
bullock,
footnote
29,
he
indicates
that
the
term
“filing
fee”
is
perhaps
a
misnomer.
since
the
amount
of
the
fee,
there
is
no
relation
whatsoever
to
the
cost
of
filing
or
processing
the
application.
it’s
fixed
rather
on
the
basis
of
a
percentage,
in
case
of
california,
1%
or
2%
of
the
first
year’s
salary
for
the
office
sought.
mr.
ullerich
--
mr.
phillip
elman
well,
your
honor,
--
mr.
phillip
elman
i
wouldn’t
presume
to
tell
the
court
what
the
essence
of
the
case
so
recently
decided
was,
even
though
i
have
read
it
in
the
last
few
days
--
mr.
phillip
elman
it
was
certainly
a
--
the
bullock
case,
the
bullock
case
like
this
case
embodies
a
number
of
facts
highly
favorable
to
the
candidate
in
attacking
the
constitutionality
of
the
filing
fee
system.
in
bullock
perhaps,
the
case
was
even
stronger
in
that
fees
were
extraordinary
large,
particularly
in
relation
to
the
local
offices.
mr.
phillip
elman
county
judge,
county
judge,
the
fee
could
be
fixed
as
high
as
$8,900.00
and
the
two
offices
that
were
particularly
involved
in
the
bullock
case,
county
commissioner
fee
was
$1,400.00
and
the
county
judge,
another
office
and
another
county
was
$6,300.00.
now,
the
court
as
your
honor
points
out,
emphasized
that
the
full
burden
of
the
costs
of
conducting
that
primary
election
in
texas
were
imposed
on
the
candidates,
and
that
had
the
necessary
consequence
of
making
the
size
of
the
fees
very
large
and
that
was
a
factor,
one
of
the
factors
that
was
stressed
in
the
bullock
opinion.
the
bullock
opinion
went
beyond
that
and
as
we
read
it,
the
bullock
case
stands
for
the
proposition
that
where
a
filing
fee
is
imposed
by
the
state
and
where
it
has
the
effect
of
excluding
candidates
from
access
to
the
ballot
and
thereby
necessarily
disenfranchising
their
supporters
if
a
candidate
is
not
on
the
ballot,
his
supporters
have
no
opportunity
to
vote
for
him
and
in
the
very
real
sense,
their
right
to
vote
in
relation
to
them
is
not
a
meaningful
effective
right.
so
that
the
court
in
bullock
was
dealing,
although
the
context
factually
was
one
of
candidate
filing
fees,
with
an
impairment
of
the
right
to
vote
and
it
applied
to
that
classification
based
as
it
was
upon
wealth
or
the
lack
of
it,
influent,
affluence,
poverty,
money,
a
classification
which
the
court
has
held
is
highly
suspect
one.
a
classification
which
had
as
it
necessary
result,
the
impingement
of
the
fundamental
constitutional
rights
of
voting
and
political
association.
the
court
applied
the
compelling
interest
test,
held
that
the
state
had
not
borne
the
heavy,
if
not
impossible
burden
of
justification
that
arises
in
such
a
case
and
held
it
unconstitutional.
now
in
this
case,
the
fees
imposed
by
the
state
of
california
are
not
as
large.
the
candidates
are
not
required
as
--
mr.
phillip
elman
i
beg
pardon
sir?
mr.
phillip
elman
i’m
not
sure
that
the
bullock
case
can
be
distinguished
on
that
ground
your
honor.
mr.
phillip
elman
as
i
recall
it
--
mr.
phillip
elman
the
ultimate
holding
in
the
bullock
case
was
it
was
a
--
mr.
phillip
elman
--
was
a
declaration
by
this
court
that
the
scheme
was
invalid.
mr.
phillip
elman
the
district
court
dealt
with
this
case
on
the
basis
of
an
application
for
preliminary
injunction
and
the
state
is
here
appealing
--
mr.
phillip
elman
--
from
the
preliminary
injunction.
so,
we
have
not
yet
had
a
declaration
of
unconstitutionality
by
the
district
court.
mr.
phillip
elman
and
--
mr.
phillip
elman
but
the
injunction
was
also
so
limited
in
the
bullock
case.
mr.
phillip
elman
yes
sir,
as
i
recall.
i’m
i
--
mr.
phillip
elman
--
unless
my
memory
fails
me
very
badly,
but
the
difference
in
the
posture
of
the
case
is,
this
that
here
we
are
--
here
the
court
has
before
an
appeal
by
the
state
from
a
preliminary
injunction.
bullock
had
an
appeal
from
--
by
the
state
from
a
district
court
declaring
the
system
unconstitutional.
thus,
permit
the
court,
if
it
so
chooses
to
treat
this
case
very
narrowly
and
to
deal
only
with
the
question
of
whether
the
california
system
has
applied
to
indigents.
and
its
exclusion
of
indigent
candidates
from
the
ballot
is
unconstitutional
leaving
wholly
open,
the
question
of
the
validity
of
the
scheme
as
applied
to
someone
who
is
able
to
pay,
who
is
willing
to
pay
and
so
on.
that
of
course
is
--
mr.
phillip
elman
mr.
justice
stewart,
let
me
hasten
to
say
that
you’re
right
in
your
reading
of
the
preliminary
injunction
in
this
case.
it
is
limited
to
application
--
mr.
phillip
elman
by
indigent
candidate,
and
i
agree
with
you.
you
do
not
have
to
go
and
i'm
somewhat
reluctant
to
tell
your
honors
how
far
you
can
go
or
should
go
or
required
to
go.
mr.
phillip
elman
i
can’t
disagree
with
you
your
honor.
if
the
court
chooses,
chooses
to
treat
this
case
so
narrowly
as
raising
only
the
question
of
whether
the
district
court
was
justified
on
the
basis
of
the
preliminary
showing
made
by
the
plaintiffs
and
the
response
of
the
state
to
grant
a
preliminary
injunction,
the
state
did
come
up
here
on
a
direct
appeal.
the
state
is
argued
the
case
as
if
did
squarely
present
the
constitutionality
of
the
california
system.
it’s
true
that
there
are
cases
right
behind
this
one
that
are
coming
along
that
do
raise
the
constitutionality
of
these
candidate
filing
fee
systems.
the
language
of
the
bullock
case
stressing
as
it
did
and
quite
properly,
the
factual
elements
of
that
case,
including
the
element
that
the
entire
cost
of
the
primary
was
borne
by
the
candidates
unlike
the
other
states.
mr.
phillip
elman
yes,
that’s
right
sir.
plus
the
fact
that
the
court
did
note
probable
jurisdiction.
it
did
not
affirm
summarily
as
led
me,
as
counsel
for
appellee
to
suggest
to
the
court
that
while
affirmance
is
clearly
required,
there
are
several
roots
by
which
you
can
reach
that
from
our
standpoint
desirable
conclusion.
and
one
of
the
roots,
one
of
the
roots
is
clearly
marked
out
by
as
mr.
justice
stewart
has
suggested
by
cases
in
this
area.
the
principal
one
being
harper
against
virginia
board
of
elections,
involving
a
fee
of
$1.50,
where
the
supreme
court
held
that
the
payment
of
any
fee,
in
any
amount
--
mr.
phillip
elman
--
by
anybody,
thank
you,
was
a
violation
of
equal
protection
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
so
whether
it’s
$425.00
in
the
case
of
man
running
for
congress
or
$850.00
for
a
candidate
for
the
senate
or
$982.00
for
in
case
of
candidate
for
governor,
if
the
fee
cannot
be
justified
by
a
legitimate
state
interest
regardless
the
amount,
it
is
unconstitutional,
and
that
if
the
court
--
mr.
phillip
elman
that’s
right.
mr.
phillip
elman
well,
it
depends
on
the
basis
upon
which
the
filing
--
basis
on
which
the
filing
fee
requirement
is
struck
down.
in
boddie
as
in
all
--
even
in
griffin,
the
defendants
in
criminal
cases
who
can
afford
to
pay
for
transcripts
of
the
record
where
required
to
do
so.
in
boddie
and
in
griffin
and
in
cases
of
that
category,
in
the
(inaudible)
case
which
was
up
here
early
this
term,
you’re
dealing,
you’re
dealing
with,
you’re
dealing
with
requirements
made
by
the
state
which
are
valid
as
applied
to
non-indigents.
but
when
you’re
dealing
with
a
fee
on
the
act
of
voting
as
in
harper,
then
the
--
as
i
read
the
cases,
the
holding
that
the
fee
is
unconstitutional
applies
not
only
to
those
who
are
too
poor
to
pay
the
fee,
but
to
those
who
have
no
difficulty
paying
them.
mr.
phillip
elman
your
honor,
i
would
say
that
any
requirement
imposed
upon
any
candidate
in
order
to
test
his
seriousness
should
be
imposed
on
all
candidates
regardless
of
how
much
money
they
do
or
do
not
have.
mr.
phillip
elman
i’m
asserting
that
as
a
matter
of
constitutional
law.
as
a
matter
of
constitutional
principle,
you
can’t
classify,
you
cannot
--
excuse
me
your
honor
--
if
i
may
finish
the
sentence.
as
a
matter
of
constitutional
principle,
when
you’re
dealing
with
the
right
of
franchise.
you
cannot
separate
voters
on
the
basis
of
money.
that’s
the
proposition
i
put
the
court
as
simply
and
as
boldly
as
i
can.
and
if
you
--
if
an
indigent
candidate
for
congress,
is
subjected
to
the
burden
of
going
around
collecting
signatures
and
a
rich
candidate
is
not
subjected
to
that
burden,
i
would
submit
to
your
honors
that
that
is
a
denial
of
the
equal
protection
of
the
laws.
mr.
phillip
elman
not
at
all.
not
only
do
i
have
no
objection
to
that,
i
suggest
that
the
case
of
janise
against
fordson
in
403
u.s.
where
georgia
had
a
requirement
that
5%
of
the
eligible
voters
of
the
last
election
be
required
to
sign
petitions
in
order
to
get
the
candidate
on
the
ballot,
was
a
valid
one
upheld
by
the
court.
now,
that
requirement
didn’t
--
wasn’t
made
on
the
basis
of
money
or
race
or
color
or
some
other
classification
which
this
court
has
rejected
as
intolerable
in
relation
to
fundamental
constitutional
rights
like
voting
and
political
association
and
free
speech.
mr.
phillip
elman
that’s
one
question
i
would
leave
to
the
future,
i
say
we
wouldn’t
decide
that
one
--
mr.
phillip
elman
if
i
think
it
may
very
well
arise
as
to
--
but
i
think
that
if
as
we
urge
a
state
candidate
filing
fee
system
which
excludes
candidates
from
very
political
process
which
lies
at
the
heart
of
our
constitutional
system
which
closed
the
door
at
the
threshold
simply
on
the
basis
of
money.
if
such
systems
are
struck
down,
the
participation
of
poor
candidates
and
poor
voters
in
the
political
processes
which
may
result
as
a
consequence
of
that
action
would,
i
would
hope
minimize
the
kinds
of
cases
which
are
increasingly
coming
before
the
court
now
--
mr.
phillip
elman
--
in
which
indigency
is
being
asserted
as
a
basis
for
unconstitutional
classification.
mr.
phillip
elman
i
wasn’t
suggesting
that
the
question
raised
by
the
chief
justice
should
be
answered
one
way
or
the
other.
i
was
suggesting
only
that
question
seemed
to
me
so
remote
that
it
should
not
be
dealt
with
here
and
i
was
hoping
that
a
clear
cut
decision
by
this
court
affirming
not
on
the
narrow
ground
as
been
suggested,
but
on
the
broad
ground
that
any
filing
fee,
no
matter
how
reasonable
or
valid
in
relation
to
non-indigents
is
unconstitutional
because
it
isn’t
supported
by
any
legitimate
state
interest,
whether
it
is
a
compelling
state
interest
or
otherwise.
the
notion,
the
notion
that
the
seriousness
of
a
candidate
is
to
be
measured
by
the
size
of
his
purse,
that
you
equate
seriousness
of
purpose
politically
with
how
much
money
you
have
is
absolutely
contrary
everything
this
court
has
ever
said.
mr.
phillip
elman
yes,
your
honor.
the
court
has
stated
in
janise
and
fordson,
and
it
has
restated
it
in
the
bullock
case
that
the
state
certainly
has
a
legitimate
interest
in
protecting
the
integrity
of
the
ballot,
in
weeding
out,
frivolous,
fraudulent
candidates
and
preventing
the
ballot
from
becoming
so
overcrowded
that
voters
are
confused,
etcetera,
etcetera.
that
certainly
is
the
legitimate
interest
of
the
state.
my
point
is
that
the
way
to
weed
out
the
frivolous,
fraudulent
candidate
isn’t
to
subject
him
to
a
financial
means
test.
mr.
phillip
elman
beg
pardon?
mr.
phillip
elman
well,
you
suggested
that
your
honor
in
your
opinion
--
mr.
phillip
elman
in
janise.
mr.
phillip
elman
if
you
want
--
mr.
phillip
elman
well,
i
think
your
statement
of
it
from
my
point
of
view
carries
more
weight.
the
--
if
the
test
is,
is
he
a
serious
candidate?
does
he
have
a
significant
modicum
of
voter
support?if
that’s
the
test,
you
don’t
apply
it
on
the
basis
of
a
money
yard
stick.
now
a
money
yard
stick,
while
it
may
keep
out
the
poor
candidate
who
isn't
a
serious
candidate
in
a
sense
that
he
may
not
win
the
election,
does
not
keep
out
the
non-serious
fraudulent,
fictitious
candidate
--
mr.
phillip
elman
that’s
one
kind
of
fraudulent
candidate.
you
may
have
a
fraudulent
candidate
--
mr.
phillip
elman
there’s
no
limit
to
meretricious
motives
that
a
candidate
maybe
--
the
candidate
maybe
on
the
ballot
simply
because
he
has
the
same
or
very
closely
similar
name
as
somebody
else.
now
if
he
has
enough
money,
california
will
put
him
on
the
ballot.
if
he
doesn’t
have
the
money,
even
though
he
is
a
serious
candidate
like
mr.
chote,
he
is
off
the
ballot.
now,
in
regard
to
somebody’s
abstract
questions,
may
i
state
the
facts
concerning
mr.
chote
which
are
a
matter
of
public
record.
he
is
unemployed.
he
has
no
--
he’s
proceeded
in
this
court
and
the
court
below
in
the
form
of
papyrus.
he
filed
the
necessary
affidavit
in
a
district
court
that
he
--
although
he
is
a
serious,
that
although
he
is
a
qualified
candidate
for
congress,
he
had
no
funds.
mr.
phillip
elman
well
--
mr.
phillip
elman
he
was
put
on
the
ballot
by
order
of
the
district
court,
that
the
decree
of
the
district
court
which
is
state
is
here
appealing
--
mr.
phillip
elman
he
ran
in
the
17th
congressional
district
in
california,
the
district
that’s
represented
by
congressman
mcclaskey.
he
ran
in
the
democratic
primary.
he
go
on
the
ballot
because
a
three-judge
federal
district
court
order
the
state
to
put
him
on,
and
that’s
how
he
got
on
there.
his
campaign
expenditures
were
zero.
he
reported
to
the
clerk
of
the
house
of
representatives
and
as
a
matter
of
public
record
that
he
spent
not
one
cent.
he
had
no
campaign
headquarters.
he
didn’t
advertise.
he
had
no
campaign
mailings,
yet
no
staff.
his
campaign
consist
of
himself.
mr.
phillip
elman
he
got
3,741
votes
out
of
a
total
of
70,000
votes
that
were
cast.
there
were
five
candidates.
he
finished
fourth
out
of
the
five.
he
--
the
wining
candidate
got
27,000
votes.
mr.
chote’s
campaign
and
slogan
was
“if
you
vote
for
me,
you’re
going
to
be
voting
for
somebody
who
is
not
beholden
to
any
special
interest.”
now
--
[laughter]
mr.
phillip
elman
3,741
people
--
mr.
phillip
elman
voted
for
him.
now,
that
doesn’t
make
--
if
that
doesn’t
make
him
a
serious
candidate
i
don't
what
does.
mr.
phillip
elman
he
went
from
door
to
door.
he
rang,
he
rang
doorbells.
mr.
phillip
elman
it
was
an
expenditure
of
sort
which
i
think
the
constitution
in
the
first
amendment
were
intent
to
encourage.
and
to
preclude
people
like
mr.
chote
from
access
to
the
ballot
from
participating
in
the
political
processes,
to
uphold
the
position
of
the
state
in
this
case
would
mean
that
at
the
constitution
tolerates
disenfranchisement
of
the
poor.
that
it
permits,
it
sanctions,
keeping
the
poor
who
we
know
are
the
most
apathetic
group
of
the
electorate
from
having
a
stake
in
the
process
from
participating
in
it
further.
now,
there’s
been
–
there
have
been
several
arguments
made
by
the
state
and
the
course
of
--
of
course
the
brief,
i
don’t
know
whether
its
--
i
should
burden
your
honors
then
any
further
argument,
there
is
a
suggestion.
well,
if
any
candidate
who
has
a
serious
candidate
for
congress,
can
certainly
raise
$425.00,
if
he
doesn’t
have
the
money
himself.
if
he’s
got
any
serous
support,
wasn’t
go
around
and
push
doorbells
and
get
a
dollar
from
each
voter.
now,
consider
the
implications
of
that.
the
state
is
telling
this
court
that
in
order
for
voters
to
get
their
candidate
on
the
ballot,
they
can
exercise
their
right
to
vote
for
him,
they
maybe
required
to
pay
$1.00
in
a
way
of
a
fee
or
a
tax.
now,
if
that
isn’t
--
that’s
harper
against
virginia
board
of
elections
with
a
vengeance,
where
there
at
least,
the
state
had
uphold
tax
that
everybody
had
to
pay.
but
the
state
of
california
would
be
requiring
these
425
people
in
order
to
vote
for
their
candidate
to
pay
a
poll
tax
would
be
selective
and
discriminatory,
and
while
i
haven’t
suggested
it
in
the
brief,
i
think
it
would
clearly
also
violate
the
twenty-fourth
amendment,
which
makes
it
clear
that
candidates
for
--
which
it
makes
it
clear
that
with
respect
to
voting
in
federal
elections,
neither
the
united
states
nor
the
state
can
impose
any
poll
tax
or
any
other
tax
and
i
don’t
think
calling
this
a
filing
fee
precludes
or
concludes
the
constitutional
question
of
whether
it
constitutes
a
tax
on
the
privilege
of
voting.
mr.
phillip
elman
yes,
indeed.
i
would
also
state
what
doesn’t
have
to
be
stated
your
honors
that
ever
since
that
famous
footnote
in
caroline
products,
when
you’re
dealing
with
the
fundamental
constitutional
rights
like
freedom
of
speech
and
the
rights
of
voting,
there’s
been
an
awful
lot
of
law
as
to
the
burden
that
rests
upon
the
state.
and
as
recently
as
mr.
justice
blackmun’s
opinion
for
the
court
in
roe
against
wade,
it
was
stated
that
when
fundamental
rights
are
concerned,
any
regulation
--
fundamental
constitutional
rights
are
concerned,
any
regulation
of
the
state
--
mr.
phillip
elman
no,
not
at
all.
but
a
heavy
burden
of
justification
rests
upon
with
state
--
mr.
phillip
elman
i
did
--
mr.
phillip
elman
well,
for
example,
i
think
mr.
justice
marshall’s
opinion
for
the
court
last
year
in
either
dunn
and
blumstein
or
chicago
police
against
mosley
in
talking
about
the
burden
on
the
state
it
says
that
regardless
of
how
you
phrase
the
standard
--
mr.
phillip
elman
it
puts
a
burden
on
this
--
of
justification
on
the
state
where
the
classification
impinges
upon
first
amendment
or
voting
rights.
mr.
phillip
elman
oh,
the
first
amendment
right
in
this
case
is
the
right
of
political
association,
the
supporters,
the
supporters
of
the
candidate
who
associate
for
the
purpose
of
supporting
him.
you
certainly
have
right
to
voting
with
the
right
--
mr.
phillip
elman
you
have
the
right
to
vote
which
comes
from
article
i,
section
2.
mr.
phillip
elman
i’ve
read
as
recently
as
harper
against
virginia
board
of
elections
citing
a
classic
case
that
the
right
to
vote
in
federal
elections
comes
from
article
i,
section
2
of
the
constitution
of
united
states.
mr.
phillip
elman
yes
sir.
mr.
phillip
elman
i’ve
read
it
all
last
night
your
honor.
mr.
phillip
elman
i
think
you’ll
find
it
one
of
the
early
advice
i
think
of
that
citation.
mr.
phillip
elman
37,
i
was
about
to
say
that,
but
i
was
afraid
that
i’d
be
wrong.
mr.
phillip
elman
it’s
around
37.
mr.
phillip
elman
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
phillip
elman
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
phillip
elman
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
essence
of
this
case
as
we
see
it,
is
that
the
state
of
california
bars
a
citizen
from
running
for
congress
or
for
almost
every
other
elective
public
office
unless
he
first
pays
to
the
state,
a
substantial
sum
of
money
described,
perhaps
euphemistically,
as
a
filing
fee
and
chief
justice’s
opinion
for
the
court
last
term
in
bullock,
footnote
29,
he
indicates
that
the
term
“filing
fee”
is
perhaps
a
misnomer.
since
the
amount
of
the
fee,
there
is
no
relation
whatsoever
to
the
cost
of
filing
or
processing
the
application.
it’s
fixed
rather
on
the
basis
of
a
percentage,
in
case
of
california,
1%
or
2%
of
the
first
year’s
salary
for
the
office
sought.
mr.
ullerich
--
mr.
phillip
elman
well,
your
honor,
--
mr.
phillip
elman
i
wouldn’t
presume
to
tell
the
court
what
the
essence
of
the
case
so
recently
decided
was,
even
though
i
have
read
it
in
the
last
few
days
--
mr.
phillip
elman
it
was
certainly
a
--
the
bullock
case,
the
bullock
case
like
this
case
embodies
a
number
of
facts
highly
favorable
to
the
candidate
in
attacking
the
constitutionality
of
the
filing
fee
system.
in
bullock
perhaps,
the
case
was
even
stronger
in
that
fees
were
extraordinary
large,
particularly
in
relation
to
the
local
offices.
mr.
phillip
elman
county
judge,
county
judge,
the
fee
could
be
fixed
as
high
as
$8,900.00
and
the
two
offices
that
were
particularly
involved
in
the
bullock
case,
county
commissioner
fee
was
$1,400.00
and
the
county
judge,
another
office
and
another
county
was
$6,300.00.
now,
the
court
as
your
honor
points
out,
emphasized
that
the
full
burden
of
the
costs
of
conducting
that
primary
election
in
texas
were
imposed
on
the
candidates,
and
that
had
the
necessary
consequence
of
making
the
size
of
the
fees
very
large
and
that
was
a
factor,
one
of
the
factors
that
was
stressed
in
the
bullock
opinion.
the
bullock
opinion
went
beyond
that
and
as
we
read
it,
the
bullock
case
stands
for
the
proposition
that
where
a
filing
fee
is
imposed
by
the
state
and
where
it
has
the
effect
of
excluding
candidates
from
access
to
the
ballot
and
thereby
necessarily
disenfranchising
their
supporters
if
a
candidate
is
not
on
the
ballot,
his
supporters
have
no
opportunity
to
vote
for
him
and
in
the
very
real
sense,
their
right
to
vote
in
relation
to
them
is
not
a
meaningful
effective
right.
so
that
the
court
in
bullock
was
dealing,
although
the
context
factually
was
one
of
candidate
filing
fees,
with
an
impairment
of
the
right
to
vote
and
it
applied
to
that
classification
based
as
it
was
upon
wealth
or
the
lack
of
it,
influent,
affluence,
poverty,
money,
a
classification
which
the
court
has
held
is
highly
suspect
one.
a
classification
which
had
as
it
necessary
result,
the
impingement
of
the
fundamental
constitutional
rights
of
voting
and
political
association.
the
court
applied
the
compelling
interest
test,
held
that
the
state
had
not
borne
the
heavy,
if
not
impossible
burden
of
justification
that
arises
in
such
a
case
and
held
it
unconstitutional.
now
in
this
case,
the
fees
imposed
by
the
state
of
california
are
not
as
large.
the
candidates
are
not
required
as
--
mr.
phillip
elman
i
beg
pardon
sir?
mr.
phillip
elman
i’m
not
sure
that
the
bullock
case
can
be
distinguished
on
that
ground
your
honor.
mr.
phillip
elman
as
i
recall
it
--
mr.
phillip
elman
the
ultimate
holding
in
the
bullock
case
was
it
was
a
--
mr.
phillip
elman
--
was
a
declaration
by
this
court
that
the
scheme
was
invalid.
mr.
phillip
elman
the
district
court
dealt
with
this
case
on
the
basis
of
an
application
for
preliminary
injunction
and
the
state
is
here
appealing
--
mr.
phillip
elman
--
from
the
preliminary
injunction.
so,
we
have
not
yet
had
a
declaration
of
unconstitutionality
by
the
district
court.
mr.
phillip
elman
and
--
mr.
phillip
elman
but
the
injunction
was
also
so
limited
in
the
bullock
case.
mr.
phillip
elman
yes
sir,
as
i
recall.
i’m
i
--
mr.
phillip
elman
--
unless
my
memory
fails
me
very
badly,
but
the
difference
in
the
posture
of
the
case
is,
this
that
here
we
are
--
here
the
court
has
before
an
appeal
by
the
state
from
a
preliminary
injunction.
bullock
had
an
appeal
from
--
by
the
state
from
a
district
court
declaring
the
system
unconstitutional.
thus,
permit
the
court,
if
it
so
chooses
to
treat
this
case
very
narrowly
and
to
deal
only
with
the
question
of
whether
the
california
system
has
applied
to
indigents.
and
its
exclusion
of
indigent
candidates
from
the
ballot
is
unconstitutional
leaving
wholly
open,
the
question
of
the
validity
of
the
scheme
as
applied
to
someone
who
is
able
to
pay,
who
is
willing
to
pay
and
so
on.
that
of
course
is
--
mr.
phillip
elman
mr.
justice
stewart,
let
me
hasten
to
say
that
you’re
right
in
your
reading
of
the
preliminary
injunction
in
this
case.
it
is
limited
to
application
--
mr.
phillip
elman
by
indigent
candidate,
and
i
agree
with
you.
you
do
not
have
to
go
and
i'm
somewhat
reluctant
to
tell
your
honors
how
far
you
can
go
or
should
go
or
required
to
go.
mr.
phillip
elman
i
can’t
disagree
with
you
your
honor.
if
the
court
chooses,
chooses
to
treat
this
case
so
narrowly
as
raising
only
the
question
of
whether
the
district
court
was
justified
on
the
basis
of
the
preliminary
showing
made
by
the
plaintiffs
and
the
response
of
the
state
to
grant
a
preliminary
injunction,
the
state
did
come
up
here
on
a
direct
appeal.
the
state
is
argued
the
case
as
if
did
squarely
present
the
constitutionality
of
the
california
system.
it’s
true
that
there
are
cases
right
behind
this
one
that
are
coming
along
that
do
raise
the
constitutionality
of
these
candidate
filing
fee
systems.
the
language
of
the
bullock
case
stressing
as
it
did
and
quite
properly,
the
factual
elements
of
that
case,
including
the
element
that
the
entire
cost
of
the
primary
was
borne
by
the
candidates
unlike
the
other
states.
mr.
phillip
elman
yes,
that’s
right
sir.
plus
the
fact
that
the
court
did
note
probable
jurisdiction.
it
did
not
affirm
summarily
as
led
me,
as
counsel
for
appellee
to
suggest
to
the
court
that
while
affirmance
is
clearly
required,
there
are
several
roots
by
which
you
can
reach
that
from
our
standpoint
desirable
conclusion.
and
one
of
the
roots,
one
of
the
roots
is
clearly
marked
out
by
as
mr.
justice
stewart
has
suggested
by
cases
in
this
area.
the
principal
one
being
harper
against
virginia
board
of
elections,
involving
a
fee
of
$1.50,
where
the
supreme
court
held
that
the
payment
of
any
fee,
in
any
amount
--
mr.
phillip
elman
--
by
anybody,
thank
you,
was
a
violation
of
equal
protection
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
so
whether
it’s
$425.00
in
the
case
of
man
running
for
congress
or
$850.00
for
a
candidate
for
the
senate
or
$982.00
for
in
case
of
candidate
for
governor,
if
the
fee
cannot
be
justified
by
a
legitimate
state
interest
regardless
the
amount,
it
is
unconstitutional,
and
that
if
the
court
--
mr.
phillip
elman
that’s
right.
mr.
phillip
elman
well,
it
depends
on
the
basis
upon
which
the
filing
--
basis
on
which
the
filing
fee
requirement
is
struck
down.
in
boddie
as
in
all
--
even
in
griffin,
the
defendants
in
criminal
cases
who
can
afford
to
pay
for
transcripts
of
the
record
where
required
to
do
so.
in
boddie
and
in
griffin
and
in
cases
of
that
category,
in
the
(inaudible)
case
which
was
up
here
early
this
term,
you’re
dealing,
you’re
dealing
with,
you’re
dealing
with
requirements
made
by
the
state
which
are
valid
as
applied
to
non-indigents.
but
when
you’re
dealing
with
a
fee
on
the
act
of
voting
as
in
harper,
then
the
--
as
i
read
the
cases,
the
holding
that
the
fee
is
unconstitutional
applies
not
only
to
those
who
are
too
poor
to
pay
the
fee,
but
to
those
who
have
no
difficulty
paying
them.
mr.
phillip
elman
your
honor,
i
would
say
that
any
requirement
imposed
upon
any
candidate
in
order
to
test
his
seriousness
should
be
imposed
on
all
candidates
regardless
of
how
much
money
they
do
or
do
not
have.
mr.
phillip
elman
i’m
asserting
that
as
a
matter
of
constitutional
law.
as
a
matter
of
constitutional
principle,
you
can’t
classify,
you
cannot
--
excuse
me
your
honor
--
if
i
may
finish
the
sentence.
as
a
matter
of
constitutional
principle,
when
you’re
dealing
with
the
right
of
franchise.
you
cannot
separate
voters
on
the
basis
of
money.
that’s
the
proposition
i
put
the
court
as
simply
and
as
boldly
as
i
can.
and
if
you
--
if
an
indigent
candidate
for
congress,
is
subjected
to
the
burden
of
going
around
collecting
signatures
and
a
rich
candidate
is
not
subjected
to
that
burden,
i
would
submit
to
your
honors
that
that
is
a
denial
of
the
equal
protection
of
the
laws.
mr.
phillip
elman
not
at
all.
not
only
do
i
have
no
objection
to
that,
i
suggest
that
the
case
of
janise
against
fordson
in
403
u.s.
where
georgia
had
a
requirement
that
5%
of
the
eligible
voters
of
the
last
election
be
required
to
sign
petitions
in
order
to
get
the
candidate
on
the
ballot,
was
a
valid
one
upheld
by
the
court.
now,
that
requirement
didn’t
--
wasn’t
made
on
the
basis
of
money
or
race
or
color
or
some
other
classification
which
this
court
has
rejected
as
intolerable
in
relation
to
fundamental
constitutional
rights
like
voting
and
political
association
and
free
speech.
mr.
phillip
elman
that’s
one
question
i
would
leave
to
the
future,
i
say
we
wouldn’t
decide
that
one
--
mr.
phillip
elman
if
i
think
it
may
very
well
arise
as
to
--
but
i
think
that
if
as
we
urge
a
state
candidate
filing
fee
system
which
excludes
candidates
from
very
political
process
which
lies
at
the
heart
of
our
constitutional
system
which
closed
the
door
at
the
threshold
simply
on
the
basis
of
money.
if
such
systems
are
struck
down,
the
participation
of
poor
candidates
and
poor
voters
in
the
political
processes
which
may
result
as
a
consequence
of
that
action
would,
i
would
hope
minimize
the
kinds
of
cases
which
are
increasingly
coming
before
the
court
now
--
mr.
phillip
elman
--
in
which
indigency
is
being
asserted
as
a
basis
for
unconstitutional
classification.
mr.
phillip
elman
i
wasn’t
suggesting
that
the
question
raised
by
the
chief
justice
should
be
answered
one
way
or
the
other.
i
was
suggesting
only
that
question
seemed
to
me
so
remote
that
it
should
not
be
dealt
with
here
and
i
was
hoping
that
a
clear
cut
decision
by
this
court
affirming
not
on
the
narrow
ground
as
been
suggested,
but
on
the
broad
ground
that
any
filing
fee,
no
matter
how
reasonable
or
valid
in
relation
to
non-indigents
is
unconstitutional
because
it
isn’t
supported
by
any
legitimate
state
interest,
whether
it
is
a
compelling
state
interest
or
otherwise.
the
notion,
the
notion
that
the
seriousness
of
a
candidate
is
to
be
measured
by
the
size
of
his
purse,
that
you
equate
seriousness
of
purpose
politically
with
how
much
money
you
have
is
absolutely
contrary
everything
this
court
has
ever
said.
mr.
phillip
elman
yes,
your
honor.
the
court
has
stated
in
janise
and
fordson,
and
it
has
restated
it
in
the
bullock
case
that
the
state
certainly
has
a
legitimate
interest
in
protecting
the
integrity
of
the
ballot,
in
weeding
out,
frivolous,
fraudulent
candidates
and
preventing
the
ballot
from
becoming
so
overcrowded
that
voters
are
confused,
etcetera,
etcetera.
that
certainly
is
the
legitimate
interest
of
the
state.
my
point
is
that
the
way
to
weed
out
the
frivolous,
fraudulent
candidate
isn’t
to
subject
him
to
a
financial
means
test.
mr.
phillip
elman
beg
pardon?
mr.
phillip
elman
well,
you
suggested
that
your
honor
in
your
opinion
--
mr.
phillip
elman
in
janise.
mr.
phillip
elman
if
you
want
--
mr.
phillip
elman
well,
i
think
your
statement
of
it
from
my
point
of
view
carries
more
weight.
the
--
if
the
test
is,
is
he
a
serious
candidate?
does
he
have
a
significant
modicum
of
voter
support?if
that’s
the
test,
you
don’t
apply
it
on
the
basis
of
a
money
yard
stick.
now
a
money
yard
stick,
while
it
may
keep
out
the
poor
candidate
who
isn't
a
serious
candidate
in
a
sense
that
he
may
not
win
the
election,
does
not
keep
out
the
non-serious
fraudulent,
fictitious
candidate
--
mr.
phillip
elman
that’s
one
kind
of
fraudulent
candidate.
you
may
have
a
fraudulent
candidate
--
mr.
phillip
elman
there’s
no
limit
to
meretricious
motives
that
a
candidate
maybe
--
the
candidate
maybe
on
the
ballot
simply
because
he
has
the
same
or
very
closely
similar
name
as
somebody
else.
now
if
he
has
enough
money,
california
will
put
him
on
the
ballot.
if
he
doesn’t
have
the
money,
even
though
he
is
a
serious
candidate
like
mr.
chote,
he
is
off
the
ballot.
now,
in
regard
to
somebody’s
abstract
questions,
may
i
state
the
facts
concerning
mr.
chote
which
are
a
matter
of
public
record.
he
is
unemployed.
he
has
no
--
he’s
proceeded
in
this
court
and
the
court
below
in
the
form
of
papyrus.
he
filed
the
necessary
affidavit
in
a
district
court
that
he
--
although
he
is
a
serious,
that
although
he
is
a
qualified
candidate
for
congress,
he
had
no
funds.
mr.
phillip
elman
well
--
mr.
phillip
elman
he
was
put
on
the
ballot
by
order
of
the
district
court,
that
the
decree
of
the
district
court
which
is
state
is
here
appealing
--
mr.
phillip
elman
he
ran
in
the
17th
congressional
district
in
california,
the
district
that’s
represented
by
congressman
mcclaskey.
he
ran
in
the
democratic
primary.
he
go
on
the
ballot
because
a
three-judge
federal
district
court
order
the
state
to
put
him
on,
and
that’s
how
he
got
on
there.
his
campaign
expenditures
were
zero.
he
reported
to
the
clerk
of
the
house
of
representatives
and
as
a
matter
of
public
record
that
he
spent
not
one
cent.
he
had
no
campaign
headquarters.
he
didn’t
advertise.
he
had
no
campaign
mailings,
yet
no
staff.
his
campaign
consist
of
himself.
mr.
phillip
elman
he
got
3,741
votes
out
of
a
total
of
70,000
votes
that
were
cast.
there
were
five
candidates.
he
finished
fourth
out
of
the
five.
he
--
the
wining
candidate
got
27,000
votes.
mr.
chote’s
campaign
and
slogan
was
“if
you
vote
for
me,
you’re
going
to
be
voting
for
somebody
who
is
not
beholden
to
any
special
interest.”
now
--
[laughter]
mr.
phillip
elman
3,741
people
--
mr.
phillip
elman
voted
for
him.
now,
that
doesn’t
make
--
if
that
doesn’t
make
him
a
serious
candidate
i
don't
what
does.
mr.
phillip
elman
he
went
from
door
to
door.
he
rang,
he
rang
doorbells.
mr.
phillip
elman
it
was
an
expenditure
of
sort
which
i
think
the
constitution
in
the
first
amendment
were
intent
to
encourage.
and
to
preclude
people
like
mr.
chote
from
access
to
the
ballot
from
participating
in
the
political
processes,
to
uphold
the
position
of
the
state
in
this
case
would
mean
that
at
the
constitution
tolerates
disenfranchisement
of
the
poor.
that
it
permits,
it
sanctions,
keeping
the
poor
who
we
know
are
the
most
apathetic
group
of
the
electorate
from
having
a
stake
in
the
process
from
participating
in
it
further.
now,
there’s
been
–
there
have
been
several
arguments
made
by
the
state
and
the
course
of
--
of
course
the
brief,
i
don’t
know
whether
its
--
i
should
burden
your
honors
then
any
further
argument,
there
is
a
suggestion.
well,
if
any
candidate
who
has
a
serious
candidate
for
congress,
can
certainly
raise
$425.00,
if
he
doesn’t
have
the
money
himself.
if
he’s
got
any
serous
support,
wasn’t
go
around
and
push
doorbells
and
get
a
dollar
from
each
voter.
now,
consider
the
implications
of
that.
the
state
is
telling
this
court
that
in
order
for
voters
to
get
their
candidate
on
the
ballot,
they
can
exercise
their
right
to
vote
for
him,
they
maybe
required
to
pay
$1.00
in
a
way
of
a
fee
or
a
tax.
now,
if
that
isn’t
--
that’s
harper
against
virginia
board
of
elections
with
a
vengeance,
where
there
at
least,
the
state
had
uphold
tax
that
everybody
had
to
pay.
but
the
state
of
california
would
be
requiring
these
425
people
in
order
to
vote
for
their
candidate
to
pay
a
poll
tax
would
be
selective
and
discriminatory,
and
while
i
haven’t
suggested
it
in
the
brief,
i
think
it
would
clearly
also
violate
the
twenty-fourth
amendment,
which
makes
it
clear
that
candidates
for
--
which
it
makes
it
clear
that
with
respect
to
voting
in
federal
elections,
neither
the
united
states
nor
the
state
can
impose
any
poll
tax
or
any
other
tax
and
i
don’t
think
calling
this
a
filing
fee
precludes
or
concludes
the
constitutional
question
of
whether
it
constitutes
a
tax
on
the
privilege
of
voting.
mr.
phillip
elman
yes,
indeed.
i
would
also
state
what
doesn’t
have
to
be
stated
your
honors
that
ever
since
that
famous
footnote
in
caroline
products,
when
you’re
dealing
with
the
fundamental
constitutional
rights
like
freedom
of
speech
and
the
rights
of
voting,
there’s
been
an
awful
lot
of
law
as
to
the
burden
that
rests
upon
the
state.
and
as
recently
as
mr.
justice
blackmun’s
opinion
for
the
court
in
roe
against
wade,
it
was
stated
that
when
fundamental
rights
are
concerned,
any
regulation
--
fundamental
constitutional
rights
are
concerned,
any
regulation
of
the
state
--
mr.
phillip
elman
no,
not
at
all.
but
a
heavy
burden
of
justification
rests
upon
with
state
--
mr.
phillip
elman
i
did
--
mr.
phillip
elman
well,
for
example,
i
think
mr.
justice
marshall’s
opinion
for
the
court
last
year
in
either
dunn
and
blumstein
or
chicago
police
against
mosley
in
talking
about
the
burden
on
the
state
it
says
that
regardless
of
how
you
phrase
the
standard
--
mr.
phillip
elman
it
puts
a
burden
on
this
--
of
justification
on
the
state
where
the
classification
impinges
upon
first
amendment
or
voting
rights.
mr.
phillip
elman
oh,
the
first
amendment
right
in
this
case
is
the
right
of
political
association,
the
supporters,
the
supporters
of
the
candidate
who
associate
for
the
purpose
of
supporting
him.
you
certainly
have
right
to
voting
with
the
right
--
mr.
phillip
elman
you
have
the
right
to
vote
which
comes
from
article
i,
section
2.
mr.
phillip
elman
i’ve
read
as
recently
as
harper
against
virginia
board
of
elections
citing
a
classic
case
that
the
right
to
vote
in
federal
elections
comes
from
article
i,
section
2
of
the
constitution
of
united
states.
mr.
phillip
elman
yes
sir.
mr.
phillip
elman
i’ve
read
it
all
last
night
your
honor.
mr.
phillip
elman
i
think
you’ll
find
it
one
of
the
early
advice
i
think
of
that
citation.
mr.
phillip
elman
37,
i
was
about
to
say
that,
but
i
was
afraid
that
i’d
be
wrong.
mr.
phillip
elman
it’s
around
37.
mr.
phillip
elman
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
phillip
elman
thank
you
very
much.
