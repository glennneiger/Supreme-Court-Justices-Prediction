mr.

was
it
your
brief

an
amicus
brief
that
made
the
point
that
if
a
man
is
a
serious
candidate
he
should
have
no

finding
425
people
who
can
contribute
a

is
that
your
--

even
as
so
limited,
that
doesn’t
meet
the
problem
that
you
raise
that
there
might
be
66
candidates
for

chief

mr.
elman,
i’m
sure
you’ve
read
the
bullock
case
more
recently
than
i
have
in
connection
with
this
argument,
but
wasn’t
the
vice
in
the
bullock
case
that
texas
was
making
the
candidates
in
a
primary
bear
the
entire
cost
of
the
election
as
distinguished
from
any
filing
process?
wasn’t
that
the
essence
of
the
bullock
case?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
it
was
delegated
to
political
parties
and
not
to
state
officials?
chief
justice
warren

aren’t
those
the
facts?
chief
justice
warren
e.

$8000
or
9,000
for
some
offices?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
that
the
political
committee,
not
a
public
official
fixed
the
amount
of
the
fee?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
elman,
you
i
think
in
your
brief
have
made
a
point
of
the
lack
of
any
alternative
on
the
part
of
the
indigent
person
who
wants
to
be
a
candidate.
would
you
think
for
example,
that
if
in
the
california
statute,
they
provided
that
an
indigent
who
could
not
pay
or
possibly
that
as
an
alternative
for
any
person
paying
$425.00,
you
have
petition
signed
by
425
registered
voters
in
the
jurisdiction
before
a
notary
public
or
requiring
or
requesting
that
he
be
placed
on
the
ballot.
would
you
think
that
would
be
a
reasonable
alternative,
constitutes
for?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you’re
saying
that
as
matter
of
policy
or
constitution
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
you
would
have
no
problem,
constitutional
problem
with
the
statute
that
required
every
candidate
to
file
1%
of
the
voters
of
the
last
preceding
election
for
the
same
office
for
example?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
elman
i’m
sure,
you
have
enough
experience
in
these
matters
to
agree
that
probably
if
there
were
such
a
requirement,
the
courts
would
soon
be
confronted
with
the
claim,
that
for
an
indigent
person,
the
requirement
of
getting
1%,
2%
or
5%
of
the
signatures
on
a
petition
is
costly
and
burdensome
and
therefore,
it
should
be
waived
with
respect
to
indigents.

think
we'll
leave
it

too,
but
you'd
agree
that
that’s
inherent
in
this
kind
of
problem,
wouldn’t
you?

what
election
is

a
qualified
candidate
