justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
you
have
a
judgment
of
the
highest
court
of
new
mexico
against
you,
on
your
liability
for
the
tax.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
i
take
it
the
only
reason
that
we
would
be
reviewing
it
is
to
hear
your
contention
that’s
--
it’s
unconstitutional
for
the
highest
court
of
new
mexico
do
abdomen
what
it
did.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so,
you
got
to
show
us
in
some
way,
i
take
it
that
what
the
new
mexico
court
of
appeals
has
done
is
inconsistent
with
the
federal
constitution
regardless
of
what
label
it
would
have.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
has
there
been
a
supervening
change
in
new
mexico
law
that
will
make
the
--
i
got
that
information
from
one
of
the
briefs
that
perhaps
this
would
not
be
a
recurring
question
in
new
mexico?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
another
judgment
on
behalf
of
your
bureau
and
the
other
side
complains
that
it
violates
the
federal
constitution.
why
don’t
you
come
in
and
try
to
uphold
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
compromise.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
the
real
reason
is
basically
a
factual
when
not
a
question
of
state
law,
i
take
it,
you’re
saying
that
is
a
matter
of
fact
these
transaction
were
about
to
a
particular
nature.
however,
the
court
of
appeals
of
new
mexico
may
have
characterized
only
the
statute.
