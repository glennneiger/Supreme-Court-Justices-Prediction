justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
as
i
understand
what
you
have
told
us
and
as
i
understood
it
in
reading
the
briefs
and
understood
it,
that
when
the
case
was
last
here
you
and
the
state
of
new
mexico
are
in
agreement,
are
you
not
that
if
the
sales
are
on
personal
property
the
tax
cannot
be
imposed?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
the
--
what
the
state
says
that
if
these
are
services
then
the
tax
can
be
imposed
and
what
do
you
say
about
that
if
these
are
services?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so,
there’s
no
disagreement
between
you,
is
there?
and
therefore,
the
issue
for
us
and
the
only
issue
is
whether
or
not
these
are
services
or
tangible
personal
property?
is
that
the
only
issue?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
would
determine.
well,
then
what
is
–
you’re
in
total
agreement,
aren’t
you?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
then
isn’t
the
issue
whether
or
not
these
are
services
or
tangible
personal
property?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
have
read
its
opinion
to
say
we
don’t
need
to
decide
on
the
remand
from
this
court
when
it
went
back
the
second
time.
we
don’t
need
to
decide
it
because
whether
it’s
a
services
or
tangible
personal
property.
the
tax
is
a
valid
tax,
isn’t
that
what
they
say.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
you
agree
–
you
both
agree
that
the
court
was
wrong?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
then
isn’t
the
only
issue
that
divides
you
--
the
factual
issue
of
whether
or
not
this
is
tangible
personal
property
or
services?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
don’t
you
know
--
this
is
an
--
we
have
adversary
system
here
now.
i
am
talking
about
you
and
your
opponent
in
this
lawsuit.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
aren’t
you
in
complete
agreement
as
to
the
controlling
legal
principles
involved
and
isn’t
your
only
difference
of
opinion
or
the
difference
between
you
relates
to
whether
or
not
these
are
services
or
tangible
personal
property?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
though
here
it
comes
and
says
that
if
this
is
personal
property,
this
tax
cannot
be
imposed,
doesn’t
it?
isn’t
it
--
don’t
you
read
it’s
brief
that
way?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
state?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
then
i
misunderstand
what
you
have
told
me.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
does
the
pertinent
fact
though
these
receipts
were
taxed
by
any
other
state?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
that’s
what
you
want
us
to
say?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
said
the
first
point
and
the
second
point,
i
never
--
i’m
so
confused
by
this.
what
is
the
second
point?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
they
were
statutory
of
those
sales
or
statutory
exempt
if
they
were
a
personal
property?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
which
deprive
private
buyers?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
it’s
not
a
reversal
that
you
fear.
it’s
a
reversal
short
of
canceling
that
$35,000
tax.
that’s
what
you
fear.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
as
i
understand
what
you
have
told
us
and
as
i
understood

in

what

can
be

and
what
do
you

justice

so,

well,
then
what
is

justice

so
then
isn’t

justice
william
